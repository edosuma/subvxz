WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:04.265
My name is Kara Zor-El.
I'm from Krypton.

00:04.308 --> 00:06.528
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:06.571 --> 00:09.226
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:09.270 --> 00:11.141
But my pod
got knocked off course.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.708
And by the time I got here,

00:12.751 --> 00:17.365
my cousin had already grown up and become... Superman.

00:17.408 --> 00:19.845
I hid who I really was
until one day

00:19.889 --> 00:23.414
when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.458 --> 00:26.983
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.638
But in secret I work
with my adopted sister

00:29.681 --> 00:32.510
for the DEO to protect
this planet I call my home

00:32.554 --> 00:34.773
from anyone that means
to cause it harm.

00:36.079 --> 00:38.255
I am Supergirl.

00:39.604 --> 00:41.171
Previously onSupergirl...

00:41.215 --> 00:43.739
-I'm Nia.
-Nia, it's so nice
to meet you.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.001
Al, is Fiona here?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.785
No, she didn't show up
for her shift.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.309
Who are you?

00:49.440 --> 00:51.660
An agent of liberty.

00:51.703 --> 00:54.315
Otis and Mercy Graves,
a brother and sister team.

00:54.358 --> 00:55.446
We are the good guys.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.709
Fighting to save this country.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.756
You think you stopped
us tonight,
but the fuse was lit.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.758
Did you get them?
-Only one.

01:02.801 --> 01:04.542
The assassination
attempt has revealed

01:04.586 --> 01:06.457
that the President
is an alien.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.076
Peace for all!

01:16.119 --> 01:17.207
Roaches out, now!

01:32.004 --> 01:34.355
-Supergirl.

01:34.398 --> 01:35.878
Thank you for coming.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.142
I'm so sorry.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.057
Are you sure
resigning is necessary?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.928
There must be another way.

01:42.972 --> 01:46.671
My presidency
is in violation of Article 2
of the Constitution.

01:46.715 --> 01:49.370
If I stay
and fight impeachment,

01:49.413 --> 01:53.678
it will only cause
more chaos and turmoil.

01:53.722 --> 01:57.204
You've done so much good.
People need to remember that.

01:57.247 --> 02:02.296
Every step of your presidency
promoted compassion,
and equal rights for all...

02:02.339 --> 02:06.648
To be honest,
there is a part of me
that is relieved.

02:06.691 --> 02:10.434
Hiding who I am,
it's taken its toll.

02:10.478 --> 02:11.957
I can understand that.

02:12.001 --> 02:14.786
Mercy Graves exposed you
because she wanted

02:14.830 --> 02:17.833
to fan the flames
of fear and hatred.

02:19.617 --> 02:22.316
And I will stop her.
I promise you that.

02:22.359 --> 02:27.147
And once she's exposed,
people will realize
they never had to fear you.

02:27.190 --> 02:31.716
Fear can create monsters
where none existed before.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.980
Remind the world
that there is still
goodness here.

02:35.024 --> 02:39.507
Be that beacon of hope
that we still need.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.552
I won't let you down,
Madam President.

02:43.424 --> 02:46.383
Traitor! Traitor!
Traitor!

02:48.342 --> 02:51.736
Go back to your planet,
we don't need you here,
you ugly roach!

02:51.780 --> 02:54.957
Ugly is as ugly does.
That makes you the ugly one.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.611
Peace in equality.

03:25.074 --> 03:27.294
Now is the time
to talk to each other,

03:28.947 --> 03:30.340
not fight.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.478
As I step down,

03:37.521 --> 03:39.610
I put my full confidence
in Vice President Baker

03:39.654 --> 03:41.264
as Commander-in-Chief.

03:41.308 --> 03:44.876
She's a traitor,
she belongs
in one of our cages.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.097
Not revealing her identity
doesn't make her a criminal.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.968
Yeah, it does.

03:50.012 --> 03:53.102
-She's hijacked our democracy.
She can't be trusted.
Hey!

03:53.145 --> 03:55.626
Hey. Hey, knock it off!

03:56.627 --> 03:58.412
This is a workplace.

03:58.455 --> 04:02.894
If you want
to discuss politics
then do it on your own time.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.419
Our mission here
is to defend all citizens,

04:05.462 --> 04:07.943
that is human and alien alike.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.902
Now, get back
to your stations.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.079
Director Danvers,

04:14.123 --> 04:16.517
I moved Otis Graves
into interrogation
like you asked.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.345
Thanks, Jensen,
I'll be right down.

04:19.476 --> 04:20.564
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:20.608 --> 04:21.696
How is
the president doing?

04:21.739 --> 04:23.393
I saw she didn't
take the pardon.

04:23.437 --> 04:25.961
She didn't want
to cause any more chaos.

04:26.004 --> 04:28.920
Has Mercy's brother talked?
Do we have a lead
on her location?

04:28.964 --> 04:31.793
Otis plays dumb,
but he's protecting her.

04:31.836 --> 04:34.535
All he's given me
is that the president
was just phase one.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.365
Well, we won't
let it get to phase two.

04:38.408 --> 04:42.847
This country still has
compassion and empathy.
I can still reach them.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.762
Yesterday
I would have believed you

04:44.806 --> 04:48.157
but now I fear that something
fundamental has shifted.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.203
Why do you always insist
on making our collective glass
half empty?

04:51.247 --> 04:55.469
I just broke up a fight
between our own people
here in the DEO.

04:55.512 --> 04:59.299
And let me
show you something.

04:59.342 --> 05:01.692
Brainy ran a search
on all the anti-alien threads

05:01.736 --> 05:03.781
that you found
on the dark web.

05:03.825 --> 05:07.872
That was last night
before the world found out
the president was a Durlan.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.222
This was from this morning.

05:21.277 --> 05:22.452
Hold it.

05:25.368 --> 05:28.806
Sorry I was rude.
I'm just in a bit of a rush.

05:28.850 --> 05:31.200
Oh, I don't
take things personal.

05:46.955 --> 05:49.349
Do you know
what they're saying about us
on the news?

05:49.392 --> 05:51.220
They're saying
we're infesting this planet.

05:51.263 --> 05:55.050
You know,
they go low, we go high.
We'll get through this.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.663
Hey, Al,

05:59.707 --> 06:01.273
Fiona make it in today?

06:01.317 --> 06:03.580
No, she's missed three shifts.

06:03.624 --> 06:04.842
It's not like her.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.714
Anyone speak to her fiance?

06:06.757 --> 06:09.064
He's in England.

06:09.107 --> 06:11.501
You wouldn't
happen to know
where she lives, would you?

06:11.545 --> 06:12.981
Give me a sec.

06:15.462 --> 06:18.116
Sarah, I've got you
on metro, see what you can get
from the mayor's office.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.423
Uh, I'm doing a feature
on Mercy Graves's
criminal history

06:20.467 --> 06:22.207
starting at Luthor Corp.

06:22.251 --> 06:24.340
-Only facts, no spin.
-Got it. Clean and steady,
check.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.429
All right, guys,
the news is not
going to report itself

06:26.473 --> 06:27.691
let's get to work.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.217
Mr. Olsen,
do you have a minute?

06:32.261 --> 06:33.654
Of course, Nia, what's up?

06:33.697 --> 06:36.570
I was just wondering
if as the Editor-in-Chief,

06:36.613 --> 06:38.136
you were going to write
an editorial

06:38.180 --> 06:40.617
on where the paper stands
on this issue.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.445
Of the president
being an alien.

06:42.489 --> 06:46.231
Um, right now,
we need to focus on facts.
That's what we need.

06:46.275 --> 06:47.581
Okay.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.800
-Um, I'm on it.
-Thank you.

06:53.674 --> 06:56.459
All right,
let's try this again.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.896
Where does Mercy
usually like to go

06:58.940 --> 07:02.160
after she's killed a few dozen
secret service agents?

07:03.727 --> 07:06.382
That Italian place on
6th Street.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.644
This isn't a joke.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.559
Neither are their
bread sticks.

07:10.734 --> 07:13.868
Okay, I get it.

07:13.911 --> 07:17.262
Out there, it's your sister
that's the boss, right?

07:18.394 --> 07:20.962
But in here, I'm the boss,

07:21.005 --> 07:24.487
and I can make your life
extremely miserable.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.707
Oh, I know.

07:26.750 --> 07:30.014
I have heard stories
about the DEO.

07:30.058 --> 07:32.495
Poisoned a boatload
of Daxamites

07:32.539 --> 07:34.671
by lacing the atmosphere
with lead?

07:34.715 --> 07:36.325
Kablooey!

07:38.545 --> 07:40.460
You're cruel as ice.

07:40.503 --> 07:43.593
I bet you even keep
that lead dispersal device
around as a trophy.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.508
You know what?

07:45.552 --> 07:48.293
Mercy's too smart to tell
a plan like that to you.

07:52.907 --> 07:55.387
Ow. Ow.
Why do you got to be so mean?

07:58.260 --> 08:01.916
Jensen, take Einstein here
back up to his
containment cell.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.874
Keep searching, boss.

08:03.918 --> 08:07.356
Those two are so far
underground by now,
they're probably in China.

08:14.363 --> 08:16.147
Hey. Otis slipped up.

08:16.191 --> 08:18.410
When he was
talking about Mercy,
he referred to "those two."

08:18.454 --> 08:21.239
So she's working
with another person,
we got to figure who it is.

08:21.283 --> 08:23.459
Maybe it's someone
she knew at Luthor Corp.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.809
I'm heading to Lena's now.
I'll try to find out.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.770
A riot broke out
among protesters today

08:29.813 --> 08:32.250
at the White House.

08:32.294 --> 08:34.078
Luckily, Supergirl was there
to promote peace in our
nation's troubled times.

08:34.122 --> 08:37.560
People who think taking candy
from a baby is easy,

08:37.604 --> 08:42.565
have never taken a laptop
from a prepubescent
computer nerd.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.698
Look at Supergirl
peddling help.

08:44.741 --> 08:47.135
She's going to be a problem,
isn't she?

08:47.178 --> 08:49.964
Yes. But one we can manage.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.576
Where did you get that?

08:53.620 --> 08:56.405
The web is dark
and full of fun things.

08:56.448 --> 08:59.103
Listen to me,
you have to be very careful
about that.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.192
We do not want
to make her a martyr.

09:01.236 --> 09:04.195
The only thing that you and I
are going to create is chaos.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.937
This...

09:07.851 --> 09:09.984
...is just a security blanket.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.643
Knock-knock.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.428
Kara! Oh, my God.
I am so glad to see you.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.821
Is that Big Belly Burger?

09:22.344 --> 09:24.346
Have I ever told you
you're my favorite person?

09:24.389 --> 09:26.609
James said you have
been working through
lunches and dinners.

09:26.653 --> 09:30.265
I have. Sales for the image
inducers have been
skyrocketing

09:30.308 --> 09:32.833
ever since the revelation
that the president
is an alien.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.704
Yeah. How do you
feel about that?

09:34.748 --> 09:37.141
It's kind of like
the whole world
changed overnight.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.753
To be honest, I didn't have
very much faith
in politicians to begin with.

09:39.796 --> 09:42.146
I don't think
any of them can be trusted.
Thank you.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.105
I had no idea
you were so cynical.

09:44.148 --> 09:46.237
-Of course you did.

09:46.281 --> 09:48.805
To be honest though,
I have to commend her
for stepping down.

09:48.849 --> 09:52.026
You know? The last thing
we need right now
is a tumbling stock market

09:52.069 --> 09:54.855
or trade embargoes
or whatever other chaos
can come out of this thing.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.726
Well, actually
the last thing we need

09:56.770 --> 09:58.859
is democracy
descending into anarchy.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.775
You are right.
Neither of us need that.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.385
How are you doing?

10:03.428 --> 10:06.301
It's hard. Seeing
this many people fighting.

10:06.344 --> 10:09.870
But James is trying his best
to manage it at CatCo.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.220
You know, telling
both sides of the story.

10:12.263 --> 10:16.137
Which is actually
the second reason I'm here.

10:16.180 --> 10:19.053
I was wondering
if you could help me
with an article I'm writing

10:19.096 --> 10:20.489
about Mercy Graves.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.624
Mercy's complicated.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.278
But, her work with Luthor Corp
is well documented.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.280
-I'll get you the files.
-Great.

10:29.324 --> 10:32.936
-But, burgers first.
-Yes, burgers always first.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.332
All right, listen up.
I want facial recognition

10:37.375 --> 10:41.031
combing everywhere
for Mercy Graves.
Let's get to it.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.511
Leadership looks good on you.

10:42.554 --> 10:45.383
Oh. Can't say the same
for that visitor badge.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.953
Ah, it's such a chaotic time.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.434
Your first as director,

10:52.477 --> 10:54.654
and I thought I should
swing by and see
how you were doing.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.136
Thank you. I'm managing.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.269
What about you?

11:01.312 --> 11:03.271
I mean, out there
in the streets with the riots.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.360
Yeah. People are scared,
you know?

11:05.403 --> 11:07.188
It's not much different
in here.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.755
Hmm.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.105
You know, a friend of mine,
um, she might be in trouble,

11:11.148 --> 11:13.455
Fiona Byme,
she works at Al's Bar.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.935
Greetings, J'onn.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.980
Hey, Brainy.

11:17.024 --> 11:20.114
I checked all the cams
along the boulevards
from 3rd Street to 86th

11:20.157 --> 11:22.116
-for detection of Mercy.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.944
Nada. Not one lead.

11:23.987 --> 11:26.729
You know what, um,
looks like you got
your hands full here,

11:26.773 --> 11:28.470
I'll follow up with Fiona
on my own.

11:29.601 --> 11:30.907
I'll see myself out.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.953
Take care.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.218
I do miss him.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.875
Not that I don't enjoy
your leadership.

11:41.918 --> 11:45.443
I can sense that you're upset
about the current state
of the nation.

11:45.487 --> 11:47.402
I'd like to assure you
that based on my calculations,

11:47.445 --> 11:50.057
this moment of crisis
does not deeply impact
our planet.

11:50.100 --> 11:53.669
I don't know
if you've noticed, Brainy,
but we're not in the future.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.105
And the future can change.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.238
Ah, that was "snark."

11:57.281 --> 11:59.022
And you snark
when your blood sugar is low.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.502
I know how to help you.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.504
Pizza.

12:02.547 --> 12:05.681
Humans seem to find calm
in the consumption of food.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.684
My calculations lead me
to the conclusion that pizza

12:08.728 --> 12:12.601
might be the right thing
at this very moment
for everyone.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.037
-Go.
-All right.

12:22.263 --> 12:24.221
Working too hard already?

12:24.265 --> 12:26.093
Sorry. Um, coffee.

12:26.136 --> 12:29.313
Coffee. I need some coffee.
I'm going to get some.
Do you want some?

12:29.357 --> 12:31.881
Yes, you do.
I will be right back.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.143
Sorry.

12:40.890 --> 12:44.589
My friend, what's it going
to be today,
pepperoni, pineapple?

12:44.633 --> 12:46.591
I'll have
a dozen large pizzas.

12:46.635 --> 12:50.291
Eleven with everything and one
with apples and olives.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.470
After you.

12:56.819 --> 12:59.648
Um, do you make espressos?

12:59.691 --> 13:03.173
I had no idea your brother's
history with Mercy
went back this far.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.219
Yeah.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.177
Mercy started out
as his head of security,

13:07.221 --> 13:11.268
but over time she became
his closest confidant
and frequent dinner guest.

13:13.575 --> 13:16.273
I knew Lex had
a close relationship with her

13:16.317 --> 13:18.101
but I had no idea you did.

13:18.145 --> 13:22.366
Growing up, my mother
was very critical of me,
as you know.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.934
She wasn't very helpful
with the life stuff.

13:24.978 --> 13:28.155
Then Mercy came into our lives
and she kind of took me
under her wing.

13:28.198 --> 13:30.722
She taught me how to act,
how to dress,

13:30.766 --> 13:32.812
how to always reach
for the biggest gun.

13:35.162 --> 13:38.165
She was almost
like a big sister. Almost.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.951
Was it hard for you
after she left Lex?

13:41.995 --> 13:45.215
Yeah. I felt abandoned.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.046
But I really can't blame her.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.135
Truthfully,
I blame Lex entirely.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.050
What happened between them?

13:54.094 --> 13:57.488
Mercy grew frustrated
because Lex was so
hyper-focused on Superman.

13:57.532 --> 13:59.490
He lost sight
of the bigger picture.

13:59.534 --> 14:02.276
She felt intelligence
wasn't enough, that humans
needed to develop even

14:02.319 --> 14:04.669
greater powers
and abilities than aliens.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.542
-That sounds unhinged.
-Yeah.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.806
But I don't disagree
with her main point.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.855
Well, why can't humans
be as powerful as aliens?

14:15.898 --> 14:17.073
-Well--

14:17.857 --> 14:19.162
What is it, Eve?

14:19.206 --> 14:21.034
-Of course I know him.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.688
-He's the chief programmer
for our Image Inducers.
-He's dead.

14:23.732 --> 14:26.169
He was found
at his apartment complex
this morning.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.823
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.607
His laptop was missing,
and Cyber Security just called

14:29.651 --> 14:31.609
to say that it's been used
to log into the mainframe.

14:31.653 --> 14:33.742
Well, then I have to block
this hack before
they can breach us.

14:44.622 --> 14:47.147
How much do I owe you,
my friend?

14:49.062 --> 14:50.411
For the...

14:53.066 --> 14:55.677
It's broke. One moment.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.639
Someone's put a trojan horse
into the system.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.641
It's trying to take down
the entire Image Inducer
platform.

15:03.685 --> 15:06.035
-The first user
has already been compromised.

15:06.079 --> 15:09.517
If I don't delete the trojan,
then every user
will be exposed. Worldwide.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.780
-You know me.

15:11.823 --> 15:14.391
I purchased pizzas
from you multiple times.

15:14.435 --> 15:17.612
You're a traitor. Hey, guys,
there's an alien out here.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.747
This has to be Mercy's doing.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.575
I'd bet considerable money
on it.

15:24.619 --> 15:27.100
Violence is the most
basic human emotion

15:27.143 --> 15:29.363
and should only be
a last resort

15:32.409 --> 15:33.889
should communication fail.

15:35.804 --> 15:38.328
Damn it! She's hacking
the system faster than
I can patch it.

15:41.114 --> 15:42.985
You need to back off.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.945
Did I stutter?
I said back off.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.255
-Got it.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.703
Okay, I'm putting a lockdown
on the cloud

16:05.747 --> 16:07.488
so no one can access
the system through a computer.

16:07.531 --> 16:10.491
Mercy Graves
is never getting in here.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.841
As a reporter
for CatCo Worldwide Media,

16:12.884 --> 16:16.584
I am going to make sure
everyone knows
about the violence

16:16.627 --> 16:19.935
and cruelty
I witnessed here today.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.719
You, sir, are the traitor.

16:23.025 --> 16:27.029
Now, give him his pizzas.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.864
I thought he was my friend.

16:35.907 --> 16:39.563
A true friend will accept you
for who you truly are.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.740
You look familiar.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.961
Do I know you?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.963
I don't believe so.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.443
May I...

16:50.313 --> 16:52.402
...get to know you?

16:53.577 --> 16:55.710
I think we can
make that happen.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.842
Well, how?

16:57.886 --> 16:59.322
My name's Nia Nal.

17:01.455 --> 17:03.935
If you truly want to find me,
you will.

18:01.602 --> 18:05.823
All right, Fiona,
let's try 11347.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.230
Nia, is everything okay?

18:21.274 --> 18:25.495
I just witnessed
a business owner
refuse to serve an alien

18:25.539 --> 18:27.367
and then assault him.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.543
Oh. Yeah.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.155
We're getting a lot of calls
like that lately.

18:33.199 --> 18:36.898
And it's good for us
to follow up on these
types of stories

18:36.941 --> 18:39.466
so that people know
how these businesses
are treating aliens.

18:39.509 --> 18:42.860
Absolutely.
But, it's bigger than that.

18:44.558 --> 18:49.519
Mr. Olsen, I really think
we need a statement
from our Editor-In-Chief.

18:49.563 --> 18:53.132
Aliens are being subjected
to hate crimes
like never before.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.177
It is horrible.

18:55.221 --> 18:58.485
Which is why we are reporting
on this kind of stuff. We are.

18:59.529 --> 19:02.489
But...

19:02.532 --> 19:04.665
I have to think strategically.

19:04.708 --> 19:08.973
And this is not
the best time for me
to write an editorial.

19:09.017 --> 19:11.628
I know you've been
under a lot of scrutiny

19:11.672 --> 19:13.717
since unmasking
as Guardian.

19:13.761 --> 19:17.852
You have another chance
to fight for justice now.

19:20.594 --> 19:21.943
Okay.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.641
Please.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.255
What's on your mind?

19:31.257 --> 19:36.871
You may not know this
about me, but,
I am a transgender woman.

19:36.914 --> 19:41.963
I know what it's like
to be attacked and denied

19:42.790 --> 19:44.183
because of who I am.

19:46.315 --> 19:50.841
When I saw that alien
being attacked,
I couldn't let it pass.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.540
I...

19:54.454 --> 19:56.978
I had to stand up,

19:57.021 --> 20:00.851
hold a mirror
to that bully's face.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.551
And I made a difference.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.032
And that was just one person.

20:08.076 --> 20:13.995
You are the Editor-In-Chief
of CatCo Worldwide Media,

20:14.038 --> 20:17.259
you can hold a mirror
up to the entire city.

20:17.303 --> 20:22.917
We have to show people
that violence against aliens
is not okay.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.920
And that the only way
we are going to survive

20:25.963 --> 20:29.184
is if we start truly
seeing each other.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.755
Thank you

20:36.583 --> 20:37.845
for sharing your truth

20:39.673 --> 20:41.022
and your passion.

20:43.198 --> 20:45.287
But there's something else
that I want you
to understand, too,

20:45.331 --> 20:48.812
is that our readers
that share our values

20:48.856 --> 20:51.162
already know
that we support aliens.

20:52.947 --> 20:54.296
And what about the others?

20:54.340 --> 20:56.429
We're trying.
We're reaching over the aisle.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.822
If I editorialize too soon,

21:00.215 --> 21:02.348
they're just going
to call us biased.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.350
They're going to prejudge us.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.701
Look, I've been doing this
for a long time

21:07.744 --> 21:11.922
and the only way
to reach people
is through balanced reporting.

21:11.966 --> 21:16.187
When innocent people
are being attacked,
it's not about balance.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.626
It's about justice.

21:33.117 --> 21:36.120
So, are you going
to let the staff in
on all these pizzas

21:36.164 --> 21:38.079
or, are you and I just going
to knock them out ourselves?

21:38.122 --> 21:40.081
Because challenge accepted.

21:40.864 --> 21:43.693
Yes, please help yourself.

21:43.737 --> 21:47.131
This is apples and olives.
It's my favorite.

21:49.003 --> 21:52.136
So, Kara just called me
and, uh,

21:52.180 --> 21:54.835
she said your Image Inducer
was hacked?

21:54.878 --> 21:58.229
Yes. It was just for a moment.

21:58.273 --> 22:00.493
I've been trying to find
the source of the glitch

22:00.536 --> 22:03.757
and it seems it was a command
from the computer
of a senior L-Corp programmer.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.368
Well, she and Lena think
that Mercy's responsible.

22:06.412 --> 22:09.240
So Lena put up a firewall,
no one can hack
into the system.

22:14.463 --> 22:17.161
That means the only way
Mercy can access
the Image Inducer now

22:17.205 --> 22:18.902
is through the mainframe
at L-Corp,

22:18.946 --> 22:20.774
and based on the simulation
I just created for her,

22:20.817 --> 22:25.256
there is a 99.99% chance
that she is on her way
there now.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.784
What's that?

22:31.959 --> 22:34.309
-The building's in lockdown.
-Mercy's here.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.717
-We can't stay here.
-I know. But wait.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.415
These aren't
my security alarms.
Put these in.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.461
Did you feel that?
It's a sonic attack.

22:55.504 --> 22:57.593
Mercy's taken out
our whole security team

22:57.637 --> 22:59.900
and got control
of the whole building.
But how?

22:59.943 --> 23:03.338
When Mercy was head
of Lex's security,
she designed the whole system.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.080
Kara, wait. No, no,
you can't go out there.
We're on lockdown.

23:06.123 --> 23:08.212
There's no going in or out.

23:08.256 --> 23:11.607
Well, should I hide somewhere,
is there, like, a closet, or
somewhere I can lay low?

23:11.651 --> 23:13.609
The safest place for you
to be right now is with me.

23:13.653 --> 23:17.221
-I know Mercy's dangerous,
but I know how to handle her.
-Okay.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.701
Mercy's trying to shut down
the mainframe.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.355
But since I installed
the firewall,

23:20.399 --> 23:22.226
the only way for her
to do that
is a manual override.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.664
All we have to do is stop her
from getting to the servers.

23:24.707 --> 23:27.449
Well, well, well,

23:27.493 --> 23:29.495
I love the ren-o, Lena.

23:29.538 --> 23:31.497
Although,
I'm a little surprised

23:31.540 --> 23:33.716
you've put
the whole building online.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.631
So unlike you.

23:35.675 --> 23:37.372
Well, she's fun.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.027
Okay, so, what's the plan?
Do we split up?

23:40.070 --> 23:42.421
Absolutely not.
Safety in numbers.

23:50.603 --> 23:51.952
Watch out.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.350
-Yeah.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.788
Mercy must have hired
terrible marksmen.

24:01.831 --> 24:03.398
They totally missed me.

24:08.925 --> 24:13.321
I always wondered
what the house of Lena
would look like.

24:13.364 --> 24:17.543
But this is more innovative
and imaginative

24:17.586 --> 24:20.937
-than even I expected.
-You underestimated me.

24:20.981 --> 24:23.070
-It's insulting.
-You have a gift

24:23.113 --> 24:25.855
and I don't intend
to squander it.

24:28.771 --> 24:30.294
What did she mean by that?

24:41.001 --> 24:43.569
-I don't know.

24:43.612 --> 24:46.702
Supergirl?
Supergirl, are you there?

24:46.746 --> 24:49.096
Oh. Just hang on.

24:49.139 --> 24:51.925
Alex, hi, hi. It's, uh,
yeah, it's Kara.

24:51.968 --> 24:53.840
I'm here with Lena and Eve.

24:53.883 --> 24:55.755
So you haven't
been able to get away?

24:55.798 --> 24:59.454
Uh, yup. Yeah, that's right.
Supergirl has not arrived
on the scene.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.239
-I can have a team
to you in four minutes.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.024
Three minutes 26 seconds.

25:04.067 --> 25:07.201
-Only on every monitor
in the place.

25:07.244 --> 25:08.768
Where are you now?

25:08.811 --> 25:10.334
Lena, where are we?

25:10.378 --> 25:12.467
East Wing, third floor,
corridor B.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.600
-Brainy's going to find
a place for you to change.
-Great.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.993
There's a broom closet
27 feet to the west.

25:17.037 --> 25:19.126
Uh, wait, no.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.781
There's a 78% chance that
Mercy's mercenaries will
approach from that direction.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.565
Okay, any other options?

25:23.609 --> 25:26.655
A proto-lab, unoccupied.
40 feet behind you.

25:29.136 --> 25:31.268
-Wait.
Is Mercy there?

25:31.312 --> 25:33.357
Yes, yes.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.011
Rather no, no.

25:35.055 --> 25:38.101
There's a 76.8% chance
that she'll be using
that corridor

25:38.145 --> 25:41.627
to reach the server room.
Uh, 67%.

25:41.670 --> 25:42.802
Brainy, which is it?

25:42.845 --> 25:45.500
The...

25:48.372 --> 25:50.592
We don't have time. Go. Go!

25:57.468 --> 25:59.688
I'm sorry, I forgot to take
my allergy medicine today.

25:59.732 --> 26:02.648
-We need to get out of here,
come on.
-Eve, enough. Come on.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.171
Wait, wait.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.608
They went that way.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.262
Shoot them,
they're getting away.

26:13.963 --> 26:16.226
Oh.

26:16.270 --> 26:19.229
These doors were built
with a hidden quick-release.

26:19.273 --> 26:23.190
I spent a summer
in high school working at
a theme park. I was a bunny.

26:23.233 --> 26:25.409
-Cool.
-Okay, right.

26:25.453 --> 26:28.195
Eve, get to the control room
and see if you can wrestle
this building away from Mercy.

26:28.238 --> 26:29.849
We'll get to the servers,
okay?

26:29.892 --> 26:33.113
I really think I'm safer here.
This door looks so strong--

26:33.156 --> 26:36.986
Okay, all right, Kara,
I promise you, you are safer
with me, all right? I got you.

26:37.030 --> 26:39.380
Eve, come on.
-Right.

26:48.563 --> 26:50.478
Of course she would come here.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.611
Where is here?
What is this?

26:52.654 --> 26:56.266
It's where I keep all
my experimental prototypes.
Don't print that.

26:56.310 --> 26:57.616
Reporter's honor.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.098
Your mother's Lexosuit.

27:02.142 --> 27:03.534
Yeah, it's in pieces.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.538
Shouldn't there be
another arm here?

27:08.496 --> 27:10.106
Mercy took the bigger gun.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.632
I have to hand it to you.

27:13.675 --> 27:17.897
This suit is such an exquisite
instrument of death.

27:17.940 --> 27:21.814
This creation could really
move humans into a new phase

27:21.857 --> 27:24.425
of physical excellence.

27:24.468 --> 27:27.036
I know. That's why I made it.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.342
Well, then, join me.

27:28.385 --> 27:30.649
Once we destroy
the Image Inducers,

27:30.692 --> 27:33.652
then the aliens are going
to go crawling into the light

27:33.695 --> 27:36.263
and then we'll know
exactly who we're fighting.

27:36.306 --> 27:37.612
I don't want
to fight them, Mercy.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.658
Isn't that
what L

27:39.701 --> 27:42.661
Your fight for control
and superiority?

27:42.704 --> 27:44.575
No, it's about doing good
for the world

27:44.619 --> 27:46.534
and helping clear
the Luthor name.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.627
Do you remember
when you were afraid

27:52.671 --> 27:55.804
to show Lex
your little inventions?

27:55.848 --> 28:00.417
That you would hide them
from him until they were
absolutely perfect?

28:00.461 --> 28:02.985
Do you remember
what he would do?

28:03.029 --> 28:04.726
Yeah.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.728
He'd say they were cute
and I should make them
in pink.

28:06.772 --> 28:09.122
This is exactly
what he was afraid of.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.515
That you would outshine him.

28:11.559 --> 28:13.430
I know
that you want to resist.

28:14.388 --> 28:16.433
But you are just like me.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.001
You don't want
to just be the best,

28:19.045 --> 28:21.221
you are the best.

28:21.264 --> 28:22.701
Oh, I know I'm the best.

28:24.615 --> 28:27.096
You're the one not living up
to your full potential.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.881
You've chosen a side.

28:28.924 --> 28:30.230
I'd never do that.

28:30.273 --> 28:33.363
All you care about
is lining your pockets.

28:33.407 --> 28:35.583
Yeah. Also,
she's not a murderer, so...

28:35.626 --> 28:38.499
Maybe that's just because
she hasn't tried it yet.

28:43.678 --> 28:45.593
-You missed.
-I wasn't really aiming.

28:47.073 --> 28:49.118
No, wait.

28:49.162 --> 28:51.599
Guess you didn't see
the upgrade, 'cause the
left arm's got more goods now.

28:53.079 --> 28:55.255
-Kara, get out.
-Uh, okay.

29:12.054 --> 29:14.753
You don't deserve
the Luthor name,

29:14.796 --> 29:16.232
Earth traitor.

29:21.150 --> 29:22.804
You got that backwards.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.763
The Luthor name
doesn't deserve Lena.

29:27.983 --> 29:29.550
Supergirl.

29:29.593 --> 29:31.378
I'd ask how you bypassed
a lockdown but--

29:31.421 --> 29:33.510
But you're in a crisis
and you're happy to see me?

29:34.424 --> 29:36.862
Yes. Thank you.

29:47.176 --> 29:51.006
You know what, they say
the Graves twins
are collector's items.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.312
Vintage Lex Era.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.227
Well, I hear
that they're worth more.

29:54.270 --> 29:55.881
If they never
come out of the box.

29:55.924 --> 29:58.492
The people are angry,

29:58.535 --> 30:00.494
Agent Danvers.

30:00.537 --> 30:03.497
Their fear is metastasizing.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.978
And you can't stop it.

30:06.021 --> 30:10.591
You're right. I can't.

30:10.634 --> 30:14.900
Changing hearts and minds,
that's not really my thing.

30:14.943 --> 30:16.118
It's mine.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.816
And she's really good at it.

30:23.430 --> 30:24.953
Somebody thinks this is funny?

30:24.997 --> 30:27.738
This isn't funny.
I'm just trying to work here.

30:28.348 --> 30:29.871
Who did it?

30:29.915 --> 30:32.178
Who put wood chips
in my coffee cup?

30:34.180 --> 30:36.051
I thought
that's what Dryads ate.

30:36.095 --> 30:37.487
Wood and stone?

30:40.273 --> 30:41.883
I told you that in confidence.

30:43.319 --> 30:46.366
Hey. What's going on here,
Mackenzie?

30:46.409 --> 30:47.846
It was just a dumb prank.

30:50.413 --> 30:51.762
We respect people here.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.463
I'm sorry, Franklin.

31:03.905 --> 31:06.908
You know what, guys?
Just humor me for a second.
I know it's late.

31:09.432 --> 31:12.435
Look, I know some of you
are upset about what
the president did,

31:12.479 --> 31:16.483
but that does not change
who we are as a country
or as a publication.

31:16.526 --> 31:22.445
CatCo does not tolerate hate
within these walls
or on our pages.

31:22.489 --> 31:26.885
And it is our duty
as journalists
to expose the truth.

31:28.451 --> 31:30.671
And ignorance is our enemy,

31:32.281 --> 31:33.804
not each other.

31:37.460 --> 31:38.722
Thank you.

31:40.376 --> 31:41.812
Remember that.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.912
Feels strange,
doesn't it, Jensen?

31:57.002 --> 31:58.133
How do you know my name?

32:00.788 --> 32:04.835
I bet when you joined
this organization,

32:04.879 --> 32:09.101
you never thought
you'd be throwing humans
in these cages, did you?

32:09.144 --> 32:13.279
My job is to maintain peace
amongst humans
and aliens alike.

32:13.322 --> 32:14.889
They attack us,

32:15.629 --> 32:18.458
deceive us,

32:18.501 --> 32:22.505
those roaches
want to be us, Agent Jensen.

32:23.376 --> 32:25.160
And that's why they're here.

32:25.204 --> 32:27.380
They came for our planet.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.730
And your job
is to protect that.

32:29.773 --> 32:32.994
And yet here you are,
working side by side

32:33.038 --> 32:36.737
with Earth traitors
and aliens.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.782
No, I trust Director Danvers.

32:40.349 --> 32:41.698
And I took an oath.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.136
So did the president.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.012
It's like there's no one left
to trust, right?

32:51.056 --> 32:54.494
I mean, if the president lies,
who can we believe in?

32:54.537 --> 32:56.017
This country is falling apart.

32:58.933 --> 33:02.415
Excuse me.
Um, sorry to interrupt.
But that is so true.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.852
Yeah, right? It's not like
when we were growing up,
right?

33:04.895 --> 33:07.768
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
the world sure has
changed a lot.

33:07.811 --> 33:09.378
I just can't keep up.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.511
I work the streets
as a beat cop

33:11.554 --> 33:15.558
and I just feel older
and less relevant
with every passing day.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.299
Uh, what neighborhood?

33:17.343 --> 33:19.693
-Shorewood.
-You know, I have a friend
from around there.

33:19.736 --> 33:22.043
Um, does a lot of work
in the community,

33:22.087 --> 33:24.915
um, Byme, Fiona Byme,
do you know her?

33:24.959 --> 33:27.005
No, I'd remember that name.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.572
Well, not a lot of Fionas
in the world,
so maybe someday.

33:29.616 --> 33:31.052
Right. Yeah.
-I'm off.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.967
-Take care.
-Good talking to you.

33:39.278 --> 33:43.499
The answer
was the broom closet.
I knew it.

33:43.543 --> 33:47.068
Even a first-level intellect
would know that it was
the broom closet.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.809
Why didn't I tell
Supergirl that?

33:50.115 --> 33:51.246
Hey, you okay?

33:54.119 --> 33:56.034
I told Supergirl
to go the wrong way.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.427
She could have gotten caught.

33:58.471 --> 34:00.255
Everyone makes mistakes,
Brainy.

34:00.299 --> 34:02.301
No. No, not me.

34:04.129 --> 34:09.612
I predict eventualities with
a 98.525% accuracy rating.

34:09.656 --> 34:13.877
It used to be 99.12%
before this happened.

34:13.921 --> 34:16.619
Is this about what happened
at the pizza place today?

34:19.666 --> 34:23.278
When my Image Inducer
malfunctioned,

34:23.322 --> 34:28.457
I discovered something
rather unsavory about Massimo.

34:28.501 --> 34:33.767
It appears
he didn't appreciate
my natural visage.

34:33.810 --> 34:35.812
He didn't know
you were an alien.

34:35.856 --> 34:38.598
He wasn't just surprised,
he was...

34:39.555 --> 34:41.166
He was angry.

34:41.209 --> 34:44.169
I know that people fear
what they do not know

34:45.170 --> 34:46.823
but Massimo knew me.

34:49.348 --> 34:52.612
And being from Colu
does not change the fact

34:52.655 --> 34:56.964
that I am also Barney
of the olives
and apples pizza.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.575
Barney?

34:59.619 --> 35:04.189
Barney is my pizza
and coffee name.

35:06.495 --> 35:07.888
Look at me.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.761
Not everyone is like Massimo.

35:13.372 --> 35:16.984
I knew that Earth would face
a short period of unrest

35:17.027 --> 35:19.073
while humans adjusted
to their alien compatriots,

35:19.117 --> 35:21.641
-I just never expected it to--

35:24.339 --> 35:25.558
Sorry.

35:25.601 --> 35:26.950
Hmm.

35:26.994 --> 35:29.953
But the next time
someone tries to hurt you,

35:31.738 --> 35:33.218
you send them my way.

35:34.306 --> 35:35.655
You're a true friend.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.920
All aliens deserve
an Alex Danvers.

35:40.573 --> 35:41.922
Well...

35:43.750 --> 35:46.883
Jensen.
Hey, is there something
you want to say to me?

35:46.927 --> 35:49.843
No, ma'am.
Everything's copacetic.

35:49.886 --> 35:52.106
Good. I'd like
an update every hour.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.194
Yes, ma'am.

35:55.457 --> 35:57.590
Fellow citizens of America,

35:57.633 --> 35:59.331
these are complicated times.

36:00.941 --> 36:04.727
Some of you are confused,
many of you are scared.

36:04.771 --> 36:07.382
You just found out
that the President
of the United States

36:07.426 --> 36:09.776
is not from Northern Iowa,
like you thought.

36:09.819 --> 36:13.127
She's from a planet
somewhere out
in the vast universe.

36:13.171 --> 36:16.217
Many of you feel betrayed
because you were lied to.

36:16.261 --> 36:19.133
President Marsdin
took responsibility for that.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.744
She resigned from office.

36:21.788 --> 36:25.139
But the fear that's spreading in this country like wildfire

36:25.183 --> 36:28.011
isn't because
the president lied.

36:28.055 --> 36:30.449
It's because she comes from
some place different.

36:30.492 --> 36:33.800
All of you know that I am also from a different place,

36:34.540 --> 36:36.019
another planet.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.412
But I've lived here
long enough to know

36:37.456 --> 36:39.066
that it doesn't matter
where we were born

36:39.109 --> 36:41.286
because we are all the same.

36:42.852 --> 36:46.378
The character of a person
or alien

36:46.421 --> 36:48.684
is not defined
by where we are from,

36:48.728 --> 36:50.817
but by what we do.

36:50.860 --> 36:54.777
The people that exposed
President Marsdin
wanted to divide us.

36:54.821 --> 36:57.171
They want us
to turn on one another,

36:57.215 --> 37:00.827
live in fear, grow in hate.

37:00.870 --> 37:03.221
But I know
we are better than that.

37:03.264 --> 37:07.094
I know we can work together
with love and respect,

37:07.137 --> 37:09.009
treat our neighbors
with kindness.

37:09.052 --> 37:15.102
I'm an alien
and I love this planet
that I am proud to call home.

37:15.145 --> 37:18.671
I want what we all want,
to be a good American.

37:18.714 --> 37:23.197
I will stand by
the new administration as this nation begins to heal.

37:23.241 --> 37:27.245
And I'll continue to protect
my friends and neighbors
just as I always have.

37:28.724 --> 37:30.248
I hope you will all
do the same.

37:42.042 --> 37:44.262
You think blue's
the right decision?

37:45.959 --> 37:48.701
I wanted to go with red
but they all told me

37:48.744 --> 37:50.920
that blue
was more presidential on TV.

37:50.964 --> 37:55.011
I think you look
very presidential, sir.
You're gonna be great.

37:55.055 --> 37:57.275
This all happened so quickly.

37:59.320 --> 38:03.281
But I want to thank you
for capturing Mercy Graves.

38:03.324 --> 38:06.545
Well, we are
still actively pursuing
any of her associates.

38:06.588 --> 38:10.418
I know fear is growing
but we will overcome this.

38:13.595 --> 38:17.033
I, uh, I was worried
you might not be behind me.

38:17.077 --> 38:20.080
I know you are loyal
to the president, to Olivia--

38:20.123 --> 38:22.561
I am loyal
to this country, sir.

38:22.604 --> 38:25.172
No matter who runs it.

38:25.215 --> 38:29.219
Well, I am honored
and encouraged
to have your help.

38:30.438 --> 38:31.570
Thank you.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.615
Of course.

38:33.659 --> 38:35.530
Uh, President Baker?
Can I...

38:37.967 --> 38:39.752
There you go.

38:39.795 --> 38:41.623
-You got this, sir.
-Thank you.

38:46.454 --> 38:49.065
I accept the responsibility
of the office

38:49.109 --> 38:51.329
of the President
of the United States.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.940
-I do solemnly swear...
-Jensen, hey, I'm just
checking in

38:53.983 --> 38:55.550
for an update
of Mercy and Otis.

38:57.987 --> 38:59.859
Agent Jensen, are you there?

38:59.902 --> 39:02.078
...preserve
to protect and defend...

39:02.122 --> 39:05.168
Um, pull up the camera
on that containment cell.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.390
Otis seems anxious.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.523
He's been pacing
around that cell
for the past hour.

39:11.566 --> 39:12.959
Wait a minute.

39:13.568 --> 39:15.091
Look at that.

39:15.135 --> 39:16.397
That's a stutter step.

39:16.441 --> 39:19.966
He's not tripping,
that's a glitch.

39:20.009 --> 39:21.359
The security feed's
been breached.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.057
It's a hologram.

39:32.544 --> 39:34.372
This is some crowd, isn't it?

39:41.204 --> 39:44.382
How many of you
lost your jobs yesterday?

39:45.034 --> 39:46.427
I did.

39:46.471 --> 39:47.994
I know it's a lot of hands.

39:48.037 --> 39:50.866
I'm so sorry.
And if I'm being honest,

39:50.910 --> 39:52.477
I'm right there with you.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.479
Let me ask you
another question.

39:54.522 --> 39:58.004
How many of you
have lost your home
to an alien attack?

39:58.047 --> 40:00.441
How many of your children
still have nightmares?

40:00.485 --> 40:02.443
How many of you
have gone looking for a job?

40:02.487 --> 40:04.053
A job that you
desperately need.

40:04.097 --> 40:06.534
But you don't get
that job. Why?

40:06.578 --> 40:08.754
Because you don't have
super strength.

40:10.233 --> 40:12.148
The law says,
"No discrimination."

40:12.192 --> 40:15.238
But, of course, it's always
"Protect the aliens,
protect the aliens."

40:15.282 --> 40:17.676
Who's going to protect us?

40:19.286 --> 40:21.201
Surely not the government.

40:21.244 --> 40:25.684
Who allowed an alien
to become the President
of the United States?

40:26.946 --> 40:28.991
Yeah.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.993
That's weird
that it should scare you

40:31.037 --> 40:33.387
because Supergirl says
that you should have hope.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.520
It's easy for her to say,
she's an alien.

40:35.563 --> 40:37.696
Do you know
what I want you to feel?

40:37.739 --> 40:40.438
I want you to feel fear.

40:40.481 --> 40:42.352
-It might energize you.
Yeah.

40:42.396 --> 40:45.225
Because when
the highest office
of this country

40:45.268 --> 40:48.620
can be infiltrated
and occupied by an alien,

40:48.663 --> 40:50.796
-none of us are safe.
No.

40:50.839 --> 40:52.537
All of them have super powers.

40:52.580 --> 40:56.366
Which one of you alone
is strong enough
to protect yourself

40:56.410 --> 40:59.587
should that alien
decide to attack,
and they will!

40:59.631 --> 41:00.632
Yeah!

41:00.675 --> 41:04.026
So what do we do?

41:04.070 --> 41:06.464
Because we can come together

41:06.507 --> 41:10.163
and we can tear out
this alien disease that
threatens to poison our world,

41:10.206 --> 41:14.602
we can invite them
to return to the planets
that they came from

41:14.646 --> 41:20.956
and we can restore health
and vitality and security
to this country.

41:21.000 --> 41:26.396
And I, as your
Agent of Liberty,
will stand with you

41:26.440 --> 41:31.010
as we dare to put Earth first!

41:32.881 --> 41:34.317
Let me hear you say it.

41:34.361 --> 41:38.104
Earth first!
Earth first! Earth first!
