WEBVTT

03:18.157 --> 03:20.284
It's your fault...

03:25.956 --> 03:29.877
- You shouldn't go out on your own.
- Yes, Auntie.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.343
Give them a good clean.

03:38.844 --> 03:42.181
You're only half a man
with dirty boots.

05:35.711 --> 05:39.131
COME AND FETCH ME

06:36.021 --> 06:37.356
Eat up, then.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.820
You'll only be here for a while.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.728
I want to go home!

14:15.230 --> 14:16.731
I want to go home!

14:29.744 --> 14:32.747
- He's bewitched the cows...
- He's poisoned the water...

14:32.998 --> 14:34.624
His sort summon evil spirits...

14:34.958 --> 14:36.293
He can count your teeth...

14:36.543 --> 14:38.545
- He must be killed...
- Drown him...

14:38.837 --> 14:41.965
- His sort can't swim...
- Better to burn him...

14:42.048 --> 14:44.551
He's the seed of the Devil...

14:53.351 --> 14:56.396
Eyes of black demons.

14:59.858 --> 15:02.277
In league with the devil.

15:06.448 --> 15:09.743
They can summon death.

15:16.875 --> 15:20.962
Yes, he's a vampire.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.388
I'll buy him.

20:03.786 --> 20:09.375
You must try harder next time.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.918
Give it a proper stir.

22:09.495 --> 22:13.041
The impure air will soak up the blood.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.711
Each to its own.

22:16.794 --> 22:21.716
The evil power will turn into black mud.

28:51.063 --> 28:54.316
He'll just bring misfortune.

28:54.775 --> 28:57.027
Dog's blood!

30:34.792 --> 30:37.127
Our son passed away.

30:52.226 --> 30:53.936
Try it on for size.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.829
You whore! You slut!

31:12.204 --> 31:15.124
What are you fucking doing with him?

31:15.624 --> 31:16.625
You whore!

31:21.839 --> 31:24.925
Want another brat, eh?

31:25.134 --> 31:27.511
Whore! Slut!

31:31.599 --> 31:33.517
What's he staring for?

31:34.226 --> 31:35.019
Eh?

31:39.356 --> 31:42.234
Whore! Slut!

31:43.861 --> 31:46.697
Think I'm too old, eh?

31:48.032 --> 31:50.743
Slut! Whore!

34:48.504 --> 34:50.464
We thank you, Lord Jesus

34:51.172 --> 34:54.842
for your loving kindness,

34:55.594 --> 34:57.638
and for watching over us.

34:57.721 --> 34:58.722
Amen.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.724
Amen.

37:12.481 --> 37:14.650
Fucking bastard. Fucking swine!

37:14.942 --> 37:17.694
You want to fuck my wife, eh?

37:18.654 --> 37:19.655
You fucking swine...

37:36.213 --> 37:37.506
Fucking swine!

37:41.718 --> 37:44.596
That's put a stop to your staring,
you bastard!

37:45.889 --> 37:47.432
Fuck off!

38:10.956 --> 38:14.501
You whore! You whore!

38:15.752 --> 38:16.920
You slut!

38:18.338 --> 38:19.923
You whore!

43:19.389 --> 43:21.349
You a gypsy?

43:25.812 --> 43:28.231
Do you know how to cross yourself?

43:50.253 --> 43:51.254
Alright then.

44:00.347 --> 44:04.017
Put it higher! Above you!

44:29.793 --> 44:31.127
Hey, lad!

44:42.222 --> 44:43.932
Come here.

45:39.028 --> 45:41.406
That's against evil spirits.

46:43.760 --> 46:45.762
Stay here.

48:13.683 --> 48:16.144
We'll surely sell a few of them.

54:00.321 --> 54:03.074
You want to fuck our kids?
Yeah! You horrible tart!

54:06.035 --> 54:09.205
- Filthy slag!
- You dirty bitch!

54:14.961 --> 54:17.880
No way, you fucking whore!

54:32.853 --> 54:34.855
You'll enjoy this, you whore!

54:36.691 --> 54:37.692
Here!

54:39.151 --> 54:40.611
Try this!

58:25.294 --> 58:28.631
Don't be afraid, horsey.
I'll help you.

59:54.174 --> 59:56.176
Where did you find it?

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:19.992
Get out!

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:09.114
It'll please the Fritzes.

01:05:14.036 --> 01:05:18.290
We need this village.

01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:55.655
Well? What's this about?

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:06.958
Something for you... a Jew...

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:11.338
We caught him in the woods.

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:37.531
I need a volunteer!

01:19:08.703 --> 01:19:11.080
They're bringing more!

01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:45.823
Filthy swine!

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.742
You swine! You swine!

01:19:48.034 --> 01:19:48.659
Snuff it!

01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:52.622
You swine! You swine!

01:21:11.993 --> 01:21:13.411
Swine...

01:21:48.863 --> 01:21:50.239
Throw him out.

01:22:13.346 --> 01:22:17.767
Jesus took upon himself
all the sins of the world

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:22.772
and redeemed them by His death.

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:25.650
Then he ascended into heaven,

01:22:25.775 --> 01:22:29.070
and is seated at the right hand
of the Father.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:32.573
He endured iniquity from many people.

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:35.034
Just like you.

01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:39.038
I trust you.

01:22:41.415 --> 01:22:44.335
I'm sure you'll manage it today...

01:23:16.117 --> 01:23:21.288
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:22.665
Amen.

01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:08.419
May I come in, Father?

01:24:43.329 --> 01:24:44.955
Quiet! That's enough!

01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:46.957
Enough!

01:24:47.708 --> 01:24:48.959
Father...

01:25:18.364 --> 01:25:20.324
It's getting worse.

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:22.576
I'm sorry to hear it.

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:30.000
I'm grateful for your kind offer.

01:25:30.334 --> 01:25:36.799
Our Lord will reward your kindness.

01:25:43.973 --> 01:25:47.434
You'll like it here.

01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:27.308
So you're on your way home?

01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:39.612
And where is home?

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:50.414
Eat up.

01:26:52.166 --> 01:26:54.793
You'll need your strength.

01:30:52.406 --> 01:30:54.241
I'll take three.

01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:50.547
I want the Boy to start
attending church again.

01:31:50.881 --> 01:31:54.718
- I think that...
- And you haven't been

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:57.179
to confession for a long time.

01:32:59.366 --> 01:33:00.742
On your bed!

01:33:09.001 --> 01:33:11.712
You'll say nothing.

01:33:13.005 --> 01:33:15.674
Or I'll kill you.

01:33:45.245 --> 01:33:47.414
We shall see...

01:34:27.621 --> 01:34:29.206
Let us pray.

01:35:46.283 --> 01:35:52.456
I'm glad you take such good care of him.

01:35:53.707 --> 01:35:54.708
Father...

01:35:59.004 --> 01:36:02.048
Read to him from the Bible
every evening...

01:36:03.216 --> 01:36:05.594
And to yourself as well...

01:36:12.142 --> 01:36:14.436
I warned you.

01:36:38.418 --> 01:36:42.297
Where did you get it?! Speak up!

01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:45.634
Where did you get it?!

01:38:48.048 --> 01:38:51.009
I've already heard about you.

01:47:09.215 --> 01:47:11.467
You were lucky.

01:47:16.139 --> 01:47:17.932
Where did you come from?

01:47:23.938 --> 01:47:25.398
Are you dumb?

01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:40.621
You can stay.

01:47:41.414 --> 01:47:42.874
If you like.

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:47.832
Close the door.

01:50:03.472 --> 01:50:05.308
Come here.

01:50:34.253 --> 01:50:36.172
Kiss my legs.

01:56:44.957 --> 01:56:47.751
You think I can't manage
to cut one for myself?

01:56:57.094 --> 01:56:58.887
You're useless.

02:01:22.067 --> 02:01:25.070
There's no time!
Away with this vehicle! Immediately!

02:02:35.974 --> 02:02:38.435
Germans! Cossacks!

02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:27.729
Get away! Get away!

02:07:38.985 --> 02:07:41.237
You're not from here, are you?

02:07:49.954 --> 02:07:51.956
Where are your parents?

02:08:02.634 --> 02:08:04.386
An orphan then...?

02:09:45.737 --> 02:09:47.614
A war orphan.

02:09:49.574 --> 02:09:52.118
He'll stay with us for the time being.

02:11:58.119 --> 02:12:00.330
It will fit you just right.

02:12:14.218 --> 02:12:16.220
The Party is a train.

02:12:16.346 --> 02:12:19.349
And Comrade Stalin is the train driver.

02:12:20.016 --> 02:12:21.392
Do you understand?

02:12:30.193 --> 02:12:31.986
Isn't that right?

02:14:11.794 --> 02:14:14.672
What's up? What happened?

02:14:27.685 --> 02:14:28.686
I see...

02:14:33.524 --> 02:14:36.194
Wasn't the order clear enough?!

02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:45.578
Not to put a foot outside
the camp, for fuck's sake!

02:14:50.291 --> 02:14:54.378
Not to mix with the local population!

02:14:55.171 --> 02:14:57.048
Especially with their women...

02:14:59.217 --> 02:15:00.593
Silence!

02:15:02.720 --> 02:15:04.055
Call a doctor!

02:15:04.514 --> 02:15:05.473
Immediately!

02:15:06.891 --> 02:15:08.059
Everyone...

02:15:08.684 --> 02:15:10.144
Dismissed!

02:22:22.993 --> 02:22:24.787
Remember this.

02:22:27.873 --> 02:22:29.500
An eye for an eye

02:22:29.833 --> 02:22:31.669
and a tooth for a tooth.

02:22:57.653 --> 02:22:59.947
Act like a communist.

02:23:23.554 --> 02:23:24.555
Not now.

02:23:32.062 --> 02:23:33.397
Off you go.

02:24:33.707 --> 02:24:34.708
Name?

02:24:41.173 --> 02:24:43.467
Place of birth? Date?

02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:25.624
Hoping to filch something?!

02:29:27.125 --> 02:29:31.046
Don't you understand, you dirty Yid?

02:29:31.797 --> 02:29:32.631
Eh?

02:29:33.382 --> 02:29:37.177
For that sort the best place
is behind barbed wire anyway!

02:32:25.178 --> 02:32:26.179
Wait here!

02:34:35.892 --> 02:34:37.727
I'm cooking cabbage soup.

02:34:39.980 --> 02:34:41.564
The way you always used to like it.

02:34:46.236 --> 02:34:47.612
Remember?

02:34:55.912 --> 02:34:59.708
It's nothing special, I know.

02:35:01.501 --> 02:35:03.962
I couldn't find anything better.

02:35:08.049 --> 02:35:09.843
We leave tomorrow.

02:35:36.745 --> 02:35:38.121
Don't you like it?

02:35:46.963 --> 02:35:48.965
I have a little bit of salt,
if you fancy it.

02:36:11.488 --> 02:36:12.989
When we get home

02:36:14.074 --> 02:36:17.243
I'll buy you something decent to wear.
What do you say?

02:36:31.966 --> 02:36:34.719
Your Mum is bound to be waiting for us...

02:36:47.857 --> 02:36:49.234
You see...

02:36:50.610 --> 02:36:52.862
We thought you'd be safe there...

02:36:54.614 --> 02:36:56.032
We couldn't...

02:36:58.159 --> 02:36:59.869
There was no other way...

02:37:09.879 --> 02:37:11.131
Wait!

02:37:14.259 --> 02:37:16.594
Do you remember at least...

02:37:17.303 --> 02:37:19.389
...what your name is?
