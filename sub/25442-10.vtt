There is a chicken.

18:15.830 --> 18:17.500
Fine!

18:17.500 --> 18:19.290
There's a chicken.
What's it to you?

18:19.290 --> 18:20.460
I just need to borrow it.

18:20.460 --> 18:21.500
It?

18:22.380 --> 18:24.500
Her name's Myra.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.880
-(clucking)
-Ooh!

18:35.420 --> 18:37.210
Mom?

18:37.210 --> 18:39.170
What if this doesn't work?

18:39.170 --> 18:40.580
Oh, it has to, baby.

18:40.580 --> 18:43.460
Eventually,
the bank has to pick up.

18:43.460 --> 18:46.080
Not the bank, Mom.

doesn't give in?

Well, then, we don't
either, sweetheart.

18:55.580 --> 18:57.830
That's what protesting
is all about.

18:57.830 --> 19:00.040
Right? And change
doesn't happen overnight.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.170

19:07.420 --> 19:09.670
I would say
"group hug" right now,

19:09.670 --> 19:10.830
but I'm so full of eggs,

19:10.830 --> 19:12.580
that I probably
shouldn't be squeezed.

Hi, Booker.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.540
Hey, Tanner! Ha!

Hi, Isabella.
I came to cheer you on.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.040
(whispering)
The eagle has landed.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.960
The chicken is ready.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.710
His goose is cooked.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.580
He's about to eat crow.

19:30.580 --> 19:32.380
All right,
that's enough of that.

with your little protest,

19:40.620 --> 19:41.920
but let's end this.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.620
I want my elevator back.

19:43.620 --> 19:45.540
Well, you're not getting it

19:45.540 --> 19:48.540
until this elevator
stops on every floor.

19:48.540 --> 19:50.540
You know what else
you're not getting?
The rent check!

19:50.540 --> 19:52.620
And I am prepared
to stay in this elevator

19:52.620 --> 19:54.750
for the next three
to five business days.

19:54.750 --> 19:57.080
Fine! Stay in there

Oh, I hate stairs!

20:07.790 --> 20:09.960

I took care of
Tanner's crutches.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.670
Release the chicken.

Mitch, are you okay?

20:23.080 --> 20:25.710
Oh! My ankle!

20:25.710 --> 20:28.040
Wait! Why is there
a chicken in my building?

20:28.040 --> 20:29.920
Because it's cold
on the roof!

20:29.920 --> 20:32.830
-What?
-I mean, what chicken?

20:35.620 --> 20:37.620
Levi, I thought
your ankle was hurt.

20:38.580 --> 20:39.880
Uh...

20:39.880 --> 20:41.380
It's a miracle!

20:43.330 --> 20:45.040
Nice try.

20:46.380 --> 20:48.710
Well, I may have
been faking it,

20:48.710 --> 20:51.120
but Tanner's
faking it, too!

20:51.120 --> 20:52.620
What? I'm not faking it!

20:52.620 --> 20:54.120
Yeah, you are!

20:54.120 --> 20:55.420
And I can prove it!

20:55.420 --> 20:57.210
Ow!

20:57.210 --> 20:58.880
Hey! Someone
lose a pair of crutches?

20:58.880 --> 21:00.420
'Cause I sure don't need 'em.

21:00.420 --> 21:02.920
Tanner has a twin?

21:02.920 --> 21:04.080
Uh-oh.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.170
Uh...

21:05.170 --> 21:06.750
Hey! Hey, Levi?

21:06.750 --> 21:08.540
I got this, B-Man.

21:08.540 --> 21:10.880
Ow! Ow!

21:10.880 --> 21:13.000
What are you doing
to my brother?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.540
-Brother?
-(Tanner groans)

21:15.670 --> 21:18.120
Yeah, I go to a
different school.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.790
Stop fooling around,
Tanner.

21:19.790 --> 21:21.210
Mom's waiting in the car.

21:21.210 --> 21:22.540
Let's go!

21:22.540 --> 21:24.580
Sorry, Isabella, gotta run.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.960
Come on, Turner,
give me my crutches!

21:26.960 --> 21:28.500
I'm telling Mom!

21:29.790 --> 21:30.620
Well,

21:30.620 --> 21:33.000
I did not see that coming.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.290
Ow! Now, how am I supposed
to get up the stairs?

21:36.290 --> 21:38.540
Huh! Good question.

21:38.540 --> 21:40.670
Now imagine if you had to
ask yourself that every day,

21:40.670 --> 21:42.380
like I do.

21:42.380 --> 21:43.750
Wow.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.750
That was very emotional.

21:45.750 --> 21:47.420
I'm really feeling something.

21:47.420 --> 21:49.290
In your heart?

21:49.290 --> 21:50.920
No, my ankle!

21:50.920 --> 21:53.120
It's killing me!

21:55.420 --> 21:58.290
But the pain from my foot
is going to somewhere up here.

21:58.290 --> 22:00.790
That's your
heart, Mitch.

22:00.790 --> 22:02.540
You can't prove that!

22:05.380 --> 22:08.790
But I guess you need to use
the elevator more than me.

22:08.790 --> 22:10.750
-So you can use it.
-(gasps) Yay!

22:10.750 --> 22:11.830
You can all use it.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.830
-All right!
-For a small fee.

22:13.830 --> 22:15.790
-What?!
-What? I said for free!

22:15.790 --> 22:17.710
(crowd cheering)

22:17.710 --> 22:20.460
But I do want my rent!

22:20.460 --> 22:22.210
Wait, no! Hold on!
Nobody leave!

22:23.710 --> 22:26.670
Mom, what are you doing?
We just won, we can go.

22:26.670 --> 22:29.670
No, no, sweetheart,
it's too soon. Stay strong!

22:29.670 --> 22:31.750
-Okay.
-Protest! Protest!

22:31.750 --> 22:34.120

-Woman (electronic voice):
Your funds are now available.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.330
-We can go.
-All right, cool.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.880

fake an injury?

22:46.880 --> 22:48.620
If it's okay, Miss Baxter,

22:48.620 --> 22:49.880
I'll handle this.

22:49.880 --> 22:51.920
I bet you will.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.380
And you...

22:53.380 --> 22:54.670
I don't know what you did,

22:54.670 --> 22:55.790
but I know you did something.

22:58.790 --> 23:01.960
Aw! I can't be mad
at that smile!

Levi, I can't believe you'd
do something like this.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.710
Having a disability is no joke.

23:10.710 --> 23:11.750
Ha!

23:12.830 --> 23:13.920
Gotcha?

23:13.920 --> 23:16.290
There's no gotcha this time.

23:16.290 --> 23:18.750
Don't be mad at Levi.

pushed him into this.

23:20.540 --> 23:22.040

23:22.040 --> 23:25.790
but what I did was wrong,
and I'm sorry.

23:25.790 --> 23:29.330
I was just a little bummed
that Tanner was getting
more buddy time than me.

Levi, you should've
just told me.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.790
That's what's great about you.

23:33.790 --> 23:35.920
You're honest,
and you're always you.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.500
Not today.

From now on, I will be.
