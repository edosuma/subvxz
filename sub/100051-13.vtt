10:35.504 --> 10:38.376
Who else can we talk to
from the gym?

10:38.420 --> 10:39.682
- Romeo's a trainer.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.641
Yeah, he touches me,
but not in a creepy way.

10:41.684 --> 10:42.946
- What about Cami?

10:42.990 --> 10:44.948
- She ever say anything to you
about him?

10:44.992 --> 10:47.385

Romeo plays favorites.

Okay, look,
I know you guys are SVU,

10:50.998 --> 10:52.695
but Romeo is not like that.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.088
He's not a perv.

10:54.131 --> 10:55.306
- Well, Kat says

10:55.350 --> 10:57.395
that you're the eyes
and the ears of the gym,

10:57.439 --> 10:59.615
so you ever notice anything--

10:59.659 --> 11:00.964
- Yeah, I'll hit you up.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.010
I wanna protect my girls
just as much as you do.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.359
- Great.

11:06.535 --> 11:07.971
- Your eye looks better.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.712
- Yeah, it was a lucky punch.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.192
- Not really.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.150
Romeo said when you come around
with that big right,

11:13.194 --> 11:14.543
you drop your guard.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.023
- He told you that?
- Mm-hmm.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.765
He said I could pivot,
hit you with the right.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.941
"No mercy" was his exact words.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.468
But we're still good, right?

11:26.511 --> 11:28.905
- Yeah, of course.

11:28.949 --> 11:30.428
- I don't empty the dryer,

11:30.472 --> 11:32.213
those viejas will have their
hands all over my clothes,

11:32.256 --> 11:35.172
and I can't have that.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.524
- What was that about?
- I knew it!

11:39.568 --> 11:41.004
He told me to throw
that overhand right,

11:41.048 --> 11:42.353
and he told her
that it was coming.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.615
- So he set you up.

11:43.659 --> 11:45.008
- It was a message.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.531
To shut up
about whatever happened

11:46.575 --> 11:48.577
between him and Cami.

12:14.646 --> 12:16.126
When I got back into boxing
a year ago,

12:16.170 --> 12:17.519
everyone told me
he was the best.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.042
- But?

12:19.086 --> 12:21.566
- He may be sexually involved
with an underage boxer.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.655
- Great.
So what's his story?

12:23.699 --> 12:24.874

12:28.660 --> 12:31.489
- Well, she hasn't disclosed
yet.

12:31.533 --> 12:32.969
- So what do you have?

12:33.013 --> 12:35.319
- I interrupted her and Romeo
behind a locked door.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.320
They weren't working out.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.669

12:37.713 --> 12:39.846
He tipped off her opponent
to Kat's fight plan.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.151
- So that's why you got tagged.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.936
- Look, I might've lost anyway,

12:42.979 --> 12:44.851
but he was pretty pissed
when I called him out.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.330
Had her do his dirty work.

12:51.031 --> 12:53.511

what you told me.

why don't we go someplace

12:56.340 --> 12:58.386

That's the only reason
I'm here.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.738

and not some jealous lies--

13:02.782 --> 13:04.653

be having sex with Cami?

17:08.418 --> 17:10.116

to a victim.

17:58.338 --> 18:01.558

the victims,

They're running some tests.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.009
When he went down,
he hit his head.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.186
- He's faking injury
in order to buy time.

18:20.229 --> 18:22.579
- I'll pass that on to Carisi.

18:28.629 --> 18:29.978

Why don't you just
pull the plug already?

18:31.588 --> 18:32.763

isn't it?

29:10.574 --> 29:13.316
- Hold up, Kat,
she hasn't accused her father.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.014
And we would
need corroboration.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.276
- And aside from that,

29:16.319 --> 29:17.843
you should be talking
to her defense attorney,

29:17.886 --> 29:20.933
and not me.

29:20.976 --> 29:22.151
Whatever you do, Kat,

29:22.195 --> 29:24.501
do not go back to Rikers
without a lawyer.

29:27.461 --> 29:29.028

29:33.684 --> 29:35.861
- How about I take a run
at Santos?

29:35.904 --> 29:36.862

Hey.

29:59.710 --> 30:02.148
My daughter's
a very angry person.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.933
When people fail her,
she lashes out.

30:04.977 --> 30:06.805
- Has she always been that way?

30:06.848 --> 30:08.067
- Uh...

30:08.110 --> 30:11.113
her mother left us
when she was 10.

30:11.157 --> 30:13.420
Esperanza never forgave her.

30:13.463 --> 30:15.030
Girls need their mothers,
tú sabes.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.553

30:16.597 --> 30:18.338
- Yeah, except you two
don't seem so tight.

30:18.381 --> 30:19.905
Why's that?

30:19.948 --> 30:22.429
- No sé.
I gave her everything.

30:22.472 --> 30:24.605
Ballet, gymnastics.

30:24.648 --> 30:26.868
She wanted to become a boxer.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.217
I bust my ass

30:28.261 --> 30:31.264
so Espe could have the success
I never had.

30:31.307 --> 30:32.743
Still, she pushed me away.

a dollar out of 15¢,

30:36.312 --> 30:37.661

30:37.705 --> 30:40.969

you got too close to her.

What is Esperanza saying?

She got hooked.

31:04.688 --> 31:07.691
Now, excuse me.
My kids need me.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.302

becomes a boxer,

31:09.345 --> 31:11.478
the other's a junkie who OD'd?

31:11.521 --> 31:14.873
- You do whatever you can
to get out of a house like his.

31:17.527 --> 31:18.659

to discuss the events

31:20.052 --> 31:21.183
leading up to the tragedy,

31:21.227 --> 31:22.445

will prevent her

31:22.489 --> 31:23.490

Was it about your father?

31:36.720 --> 31:38.244
- Esperanza.

You have to give the jury
a reason

31:39.506 --> 31:42.378

I'm a fighter.

31:45.947 --> 31:46.905
I can't look weak.

31:46.948 --> 31:50.299

isn't weak.

31:50.343 --> 31:52.519
And whatever happened to you

31:52.562 --> 31:54.390

when he crawled into my bed.

32:21.417 --> 32:22.766
- Your father.

That's how I knew he was coming
for me.

32:39.261 --> 32:40.959

I told him I needed
to protect myself.

33:20.781 --> 33:23.566

to do the same.

39:38.550 --> 39:40.073
Okay.

39:45.034 --> 39:46.427
- Santos Morales.

39:46.471 --> 39:47.776
- You're under arrest.
- What?

39:47.820 --> 39:49.299
- Get your hands on the wall.
- What is this?

39:49.343 --> 39:51.389
- Keep 'em up.
- Huh?

39:53.042 --> 39:54.740
My own daughter?

39:54.783 --> 39:56.785
You set me up?

39:56.829 --> 39:58.439
How could you do this?

39:58.483 --> 40:01.181
- How could I?
How could you?!

40:01.224 --> 40:02.835
I hope you die in prison!

40:04.663 --> 40:07.187
Tell Officer Tamin
she didn't need to pay me.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.407
I wanna give her
the money back.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.845
- Graciela!

40:20.722 --> 40:23.769
- Morales.
You got visitors.

40:33.866 --> 40:35.433
- Kat?

40:38.174 --> 40:40.438
Graciela?

40:43.049 --> 40:44.703
- I'm sorry.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.400
I'm so sorry.

40:53.886 --> 40:56.889
[both crying]

40:58.760 --> 40:59.892
- Thank you.

40:59.935 --> 41:02.895
[warm music]

41:41.803 --> 41:44.763
[wolf howls]
