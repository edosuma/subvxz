WEBVTT

00:01.419 --> 00:03.785
You pull into the roll.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.290
It's counterintuitive at first,

00:05.381 --> 00:07.713
but it radically increases your
distance from the enemy.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.336
Aeryn, my module is a
research craft.

00:09.427 --> 00:11.668
It's not built for
hairpin maneuvers.

00:11.762 --> 00:14.674
Would you like to learn
how to do this

00:14.765 --> 00:17.381
or are you content to
continually display
your ineptitude?

00:17.476 --> 00:21.765
My ineptitude?
You mean my improvisation
that kind of bails your sorry military...

00:21.856 --> 00:24.188
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:24.275 --> 00:25.640
What is that smell?

00:25.735 --> 00:26.520
What?

00:26.611 --> 00:28.317
It's your hair. It smells.

00:28.404 --> 00:29.985
Zhaan gave me something.

00:30.072 --> 00:31.573
All right.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.693
It smells good.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.363
I like it.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.748
Well, it's not for you to like.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.454
Oh.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.658
Then what's it for?

00:43.753 --> 00:45.869
For me to like.

00:45.963 --> 00:49.171
You don't like that...
I like it?

00:50.635 --> 00:54.503
Personal indulgences can
fracture a small crew.

00:56.474 --> 01:01.810
I would never tell them that
you scented your hair.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.959
No!

01:24.710 --> 01:26.246
Aeryn... Aeryn, no.

01:26.337 --> 01:30.330
No, no, I will not be a slave
to your hormones.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.257
My hormones? Hey, I was lips,
you were tongue.

01:36.389 --> 01:38.721
Why did you do your hair? Huh?

01:38.808 --> 01:40.298
To see if you'd notice.

01:40.393 --> 01:43.260
Standing at attention.

01:43.354 --> 01:46.061
Well, I'll let Zhaan know that
you find her oils pleasing.

01:46.148 --> 01:48.981
It's you | find pleasing.

01:52.238 --> 01:53.728
You want some advice?

01:53.823 --> 01:56.235
Not particularly.

01:56.325 --> 01:59.283
Makes me want to give it
to you even more.

01:59.370 --> 02:03.204
Hey, there's too much pressure.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.124
She's scared of the future.

02:07.086 --> 02:09.327
So why not just live
in the moment?

02:09.422 --> 02:12.334
You come up with that yourself?

02:12.425 --> 02:17.340
Go fast with the body,
slow with the soul.

02:19.098 --> 02:21.339
Maybe you should find
someone like that.

02:21.434 --> 02:23.390
Pilot:
Commander Crichton, Chiana.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.469
Please join the others in
the Command at once.

02:30.568 --> 02:32.308
D'Argo:
Okay, Pilot, they're here.

02:32.403 --> 02:35.145
Now, tell us why have
we stopped moving?

02:35.239 --> 02:38.231
Are you familiar with Automated
Peacekeeper Satellite Weaponry?

02:38.326 --> 02:40.362
Self-Tracking Pulse Cannons?

02:40.453 --> 02:42.318
We are locked in a
cross-targeted helix.

02:42.413 --> 02:45.029
Pilot, give us
immediate Starburst.
-lmpossible.

02:45.124 --> 02:48.582
The initiation of an energy
surge will result in
our destruction.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.160
Is it Scorpius?
Do you think they found us?

02:51.255 --> 02:53.337
There are no vessels
anywhere near.

02:53.424 --> 02:55.255
Then how the frell did
they get here?

02:55.343 --> 02:59.757
Perhaps from the inhabited
star systems on Moya's
sense horizon.

02:59.847 --> 03:03.214
These cannons appear to be
their first line of defense.

03:03.309 --> 03:06.267
Zhaan:
Peacekeeper settlements
this far into the Uncharted Territories?

03:06.354 --> 03:07.264
Goddess help us.

03:07.355 --> 03:08.140
We got to do something.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.266
( praying )
-Something useful.

03:10.358 --> 03:14.852
A representative of the
inhabited system has
been signaling us.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.403
By the yotzl Run, fight,
surrender. Pick one!

03:18.491 --> 03:21.949
Pilot:
Moya chooses surrender.

03:22.036 --> 03:26.245
Resistance by her means death.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.038
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:32.129 --> 03:35.292
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

03:35.383 --> 03:38.295
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

03:38.386 --> 03:41.753
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

03:41.847 --> 03:42.597
Help me.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.137
Listen, please.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.056
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:46.143 --> 03:50.136
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.597
I'm doing everything I can.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.524
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.456
lam.

04:15.548 --> 04:19.006
Oh, no. No way, Jose.
You keep your mouth shut.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.129
But I am our best negotiator.

04:21.220 --> 04:25.304
Our best self-serving, to hell
with everyone else-iator.
Shut up.

04:25.391 --> 04:29.259
Tyno:
Our scan reveals you,
indeed have no large weaponry or hidden cargo.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.935
Aeryn:
Yes, and despite this ship's
Peacekeeper history,

04:32.022 --> 04:34.513
we are in no way affiliated
with them.

04:34.608 --> 04:38.692
We are as stated, Counselor
Tyno, peaceful.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.646
And as such, we now release you
to travel as you will.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.867
You're not going to shoot?

04:43.951 --> 04:47.034
Well, that was a productive
four arns.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.827
D'Argo:
May we approach your worlds?

04:48.914 --> 04:50.870
We are prepared to pay
for provisions.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.540
I'm afraid that's impossible
during coronation time.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.333
( loud crunch )
(yells in pain)

04:55.421 --> 04:57.662
Rygel:
Coronation time?

04:57.756 --> 05:02.090
I am Dominar Rygel the Sixteenth
of the Hynerian Empire.

05:02.178 --> 05:05.921
Would you turn away royalty
bearing gifts for your
new sovereign?

05:06.015 --> 05:07.971
Escaped prisoners bearing gifts?

05:08.058 --> 05:14.054
Hear me, Counselor Tyno, your
hatred of the Peacekeepers can
never approach ours.

05:14.148 --> 05:17.686
Fate has conspired to forge
this alliance.

05:19.278 --> 05:22.190
The Royal Planet will
receive you.

05:22.281 --> 05:27.571
Understand, as festivities
approach, we are under
strict security.

05:27.661 --> 05:31.700
Weapons of any kind will
result in incarceration.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.245
Was I right?

05:35.336 --> 05:36.667
Yeah, I guess so.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.290
Was I right?

05:38.380 --> 05:40.245
Yes, Rygel, you were right.

05:40.341 --> 05:43.754
Don't ever forget it.

05:48.224 --> 05:49.259
Aeryn, I want to talk.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.931
I want to talk less.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.134
We tried that.
It leads to kissing.

05:53.229 --> 05:54.139
Oh...

05:54.230 --> 05:55.720
That's a joke.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.270
It's to relieve the tension.

05:57.358 --> 06:00.191
Wasn't funny. Just give me
some space, John.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.777
Fine. Have the whole universe.

06:04.990 --> 06:05.820
Chiana!

06:05.908 --> 06:07.273
Chiana:
Yeahl

06:07.368 --> 06:09.359
I'm going down to the planet.
You want to hang?

06:09.453 --> 06:11.865
( breathless ):
Yeahl

06:11.956 --> 06:13.992
That's good.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.698
Cool, can I come in?

06:17.419 --> 06:20.411
( both yelling orgasmically)
Whoa, geez!

06:22.216 --> 06:24.002
Whoa-ho-ho! Bad time.

06:24.093 --> 06:28.553
No, good time.
Sorry, wrong time.

06:28.639 --> 06:32.257
John, my life has been one
crushing disappointment
after the next

06:32.351 --> 06:37.311
but with this girl l have
managed to find moments
of pleasure.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.230
Don't blow it for me.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.528
Never, it's cool.
I'm happy for you.

06:46.615 --> 06:48.025
Good.
-All right?

06:48.117 --> 06:49.778
Good.
-Good.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.201
How come I'm always the
last to know?

07:35.289 --> 07:36.745
(laughing)

07:36.832 --> 07:39.790
So these are the fabled
breakaway colonies.

07:39.877 --> 07:42.414
When they declared independence
and fled from our home systems

07:42.504 --> 07:44.290
no one gave them a chance
of surviving.

07:44.381 --> 07:48.920
And yet, here they are still
hating the Peacekeepers
1,900 cycles later.

07:49.011 --> 07:52.253
And every Peacekeeper attempt
since then to forge a
coalition has failed.

07:52.348 --> 07:55.761
I'd say they enjoy their
freedoms far too much, Aeryn.

07:55.851 --> 07:57.933
Yeah.
-And why not?

07:58.020 --> 07:59.806
Buy you a drink for a few words.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.603
You mean now that
Chiana's occupied?

08:01.690 --> 08:03.305
Have you made a run
at Zhaan yet?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.810
Oh, that is unfair.

08:08.030 --> 08:11.488
Oh, no, no, no, no, I stopped
raving years ago.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.860
It doesn't hurt you.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.691
It's just for the kiss.

08:21.794 --> 08:23.750
It's no taste.
Kind of like an old...

08:30.302 --> 08:32.338
Sorry.

08:32.429 --> 08:36.889
It's great, you know. It's a
whole world designed for
your rutting instincts.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.352
No. No, no, no, no, no.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.303
Try him. He seems to
love kissing.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.268
Oh, no, no.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.571
I am never leaving this world.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.835
Hey.

09:05.796 --> 09:10.506
Jena:
Clavor, my sweet, there's a
Sebacean down here your sister hasn't kissed yet.

09:13.178 --> 09:17.137
You said the borders were
closed. No new visitors.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.886
And you said it wouldn't matter
that my sister could never
assume the throne,

09:19.977 --> 09:21.968
no matter how many suitors
they bring in.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.896
Her chemical compatibility
is irrevocably altered.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.895
You will be king.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.977
Tyno:
Is this Crichton intelligent?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.813
Rygel:
Surprisingly, despite
his appearance.

09:33.907 --> 09:38.241
| find it strange, Counselor
Tyno, that you're in
Coronation Time

09:38.328 --> 09:41.411
and have yet to identify
your crown successor.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.831
As firstborn, it was always
intended for Princess Katralla.

09:44.918 --> 09:48.376
But by law, unless she can find
a compatible mate,

09:48.464 --> 09:51.001
the kingdom will fall to
her younger brother.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.501
She's a slave to our mother.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.255
I'm the only one who'll
recognize the Scarran lmperium,

09:55.345 --> 09:57.802
even if you are the best
they could send.

09:57.890 --> 09:58.879
(growling)

09:58.974 --> 10:01.260
Now, now, you two.

10:03.604 --> 10:07.267
Well, if you're not going
to be king, Clavor,

10:07.357 --> 10:09.348
I'm not going to marry you.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.065
Pilot:
Excuse me, Zhaan.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.898
Why didn't you visit the
Royal Planet with the others?

10:18.494 --> 10:21.076
My solitude is so important
to me, Pilot.

10:21.163 --> 10:25.031
I barely have enough time to
pursue the tenets of my
priesthood as it is.

10:25.125 --> 10:31.041
Being presumptuous, l have
opened all the doors on the
chamber on this tier.

10:31.131 --> 10:36.376
Moya and l are pleased you
have once again chosen
to stay with us.

10:45.813 --> 10:50.352
(sings high-pitched
sustained note)

10:52.444 --> 10:55.311
( note echoing )

10:58.951 --> 11:02.569
Chiana:
Two drops from these little
vials and we can tell if our...

11:02.663 --> 11:04.745
if our DNA is compatible
for children.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.322
D'Argo:
Um, no, no. I...

11:06.416 --> 11:08.202
Come on, what have we
got to lose?
-I don't want to.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.205
Our innocence.
That's what we've got to lose.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.799
Ah...

11:21.890 --> 11:24.267
Hey, hey...

11:24.351 --> 11:26.683
It's just a game for us,
D'Argo, okay?

11:26.770 --> 11:29.056
We don't play by the
rules they do.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.399
The truth is, we're
not compatible.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.729
Well, only our DNA...

11:34.820 --> 11:37.152
(gasping)

11:37.239 --> 11:41.733
not the parts that make
us feel pleasure.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.818
Rygel:
Why is he watching us
so intently?

11:43.912 --> 11:47.325
When's the last time you
saw a Scarran on a
diplomatic mission?

11:47.416 --> 11:50.749
What do you think he wants,
besides killing Peacekeepers,
I mean?

11:50.836 --> 11:54.670
The same thing my former
superiors wanted, a covenant
with this kingdom.

11:57.676 --> 11:58.882
Go away.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.259
Go.

12:09.187 --> 12:10.393
(gasps )

12:10.480 --> 12:12.016
Have you lost your mind?

12:12.107 --> 12:13.392
Do it.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.734
Ewwl

12:20.282 --> 12:21.397
Sweet.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.277
I'm so pleased.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.400
Rygel:
Me, too.

12:26.163 --> 12:27.869
How unexpected.

12:27.956 --> 12:31.289
| wish you both the very
best of fortune.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.491
Thank you.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.076
( laughing nervously)

12:34.171 --> 12:35.331
( both spitting loudly)

12:35.422 --> 12:38.209
(singing sustained note)

12:38.967 --> 12:40.377
Pilot:
Zhaan...

12:41.011 --> 12:42.592
Zhaan!

12:42.679 --> 12:44.294
Pilot, are you calling me?

12:44.389 --> 12:45.299
It's Scorpius.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.722
Scorpius has found us.

12:57.903 --> 13:00.189
Is the Command Carrier
any closer, Pilot?

13:00.280 --> 13:03.272
Still held in abeyance at the
Satellite Cannon perimeter.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.777
Have they spotted our orbit yet?

13:04.868 --> 13:06.108
Confirmed.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.285
Moya senses the
Peacekeeper scan.

13:08.372 --> 13:11.114
Have we got time to retrieve
Crichton and the others?

13:11.208 --> 13:12.368
No.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.199
(sighing)

13:15.253 --> 13:17.790
What if we let them
see us and then...

13:17.881 --> 13:20.042
Starburst.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.546
Scorpius may think we're
all aboard and pursue.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.840
Goddess, please send
us guidance.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.888
Make this the right
thing to do.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.392
Where are D'Argo and Chiana?

13:39.486 --> 13:44.697
Alternately exchanging body
fluids and checking a tracking
station to locate Moya's orbit.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.899
Doesn't that just figure?
Look, let's get that drink
out of your hand.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.985
-Excuse me.
I'm going to sober you up
and get you out of here.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.194
Yeah, in a second, buddy.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.665
Were you once a Peacekeeper?

13:54.418 --> 13:56.875
No.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.498
Oh, it's Counselor Tyno, right?

13:58.588 --> 14:00.499
Look, we got a little problem.
Our ship...

14:00.590 --> 14:04.503
Your friends have been given
access to our Space Command to
find your ship,

14:04.594 --> 14:08.382
but for now if you don't mind.

14:11.852 --> 14:15.515
Look, I'm a little partied out
so if you could maybe...

14:15.605 --> 14:17.311
Please.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.318
Okay.

14:47.262 --> 14:49.378
(lustful sigh)

14:58.440 --> 15:00.305
It's, uh, sweet.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.812
It's sweet. It's kind of
like molasses.

15:03.737 --> 15:04.567
Tyno:
Guards.

15:05.697 --> 15:06.777
Woman 2:
Look at the Princess!

15:06.865 --> 15:08.071
Woman 3:
She's smiling.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.989
Uh-oh.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.318
Cannot be!
-No, Clavor.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.822
Take your claws off me.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.121
My sister is not supposed to be
compatible with another
Sebacean.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.415
And as far as we know,
she isn't.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.493
Do not make a spectacle,
Your Highness.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.622
The kiss was sweet!

15:21.713 --> 15:23.419
They're compatible!

15:24.132 --> 15:25.542
What the hell's going on?

15:25.634 --> 15:27.716
For your protection.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.135
What if their DNA is cohesive?

15:30.222 --> 15:35.637
Then this pawn, whoever he is,
must die tragically within
a solar day.

15:35.727 --> 15:39.265
(growling)

15:46.196 --> 15:50.314
I understand everything you're
almost saying, except am I
under arrest?

15:50.408 --> 15:51.158
Absolutely not.

15:51.243 --> 15:52.449
Good.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.735
Please, try to understand.

15:55.831 --> 15:56.786
I understand.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.330
You asked me to kiss that chick.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.078
You kissed our Princess.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.125
Yeah, and now we're
"compatible"? What the hell
does that mean?

16:03.213 --> 16:06.296
You're the only male we've found
who might be able to provide her

16:06.383 --> 16:07.964
with healthy children.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.426
You want a donation at
the sperm bank?

16:13.140 --> 16:16.007
I want you to consider
marrying her.

16:23.900 --> 16:28.143
You would just have to be
on this side of my life

16:28.238 --> 16:31.446
to understand how frelling
insane that is.

16:31.533 --> 16:35.242
She will be our next Empress.
You would be Regent.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.410
Others would die for
this chance.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.283
See, "die." There's the problem.
There's the "die" part.

16:39.374 --> 16:43.287
All | ask is that you consider
this blessing that's been
laid before you.

16:43.378 --> 16:46.415
"Blessing", Counselor Tyno?

16:46.506 --> 16:50.840
When the actual truth of power
is so much closer to "curse."

16:50.927 --> 16:52.337
What?

16:54.764 --> 16:56.300
Stop it!

16:56.391 --> 16:58.882
Before I speak with them,
notdunng.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.309
She's an ignorant creature.

17:01.396 --> 17:05.560
John Crichton, Prince Clavor,
our second-in-line
to the throne.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.562
First among my people.

17:08.653 --> 17:12.020
You may take the guards and
leave us now, Tyno.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.106
My instructions are otherwise.

17:14.201 --> 17:20.162
This potential suitor to the
throne is to remain under
protective custody at all times.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.955
And whose order dares to
countermand mine?

17:23.043 --> 17:24.499
The Empress.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.292
Your mother.

17:34.346 --> 17:37.008
I will speak with you...

17:37.098 --> 17:38.599
later.

17:44.189 --> 17:48.683
There's always one in
every family.

17:48.777 --> 17:52.941
lf Princess Katralla fails to
wed by the anniversary
of her birth

17:53.031 --> 17:55.317
the throne goes to
Prince Clavor.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.615
Uh-huh. When's the expiry day?

17:57.702 --> 17:59.693
A matter of solar days.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.038
Is this my cell?

18:04.125 --> 18:05.456
Your room, yes.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.413
(sighs)

18:14.177 --> 18:16.168
Where have you two been?

18:16.263 --> 18:18.879
We've been in the Space Command
Center all night.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.056
Moya is no longer in orbit
around this planet.

18:21.142 --> 18:25.181
And Flight Control confirmed
that she didn't crash, so Zhaan
and Pilot probably just...

18:25.272 --> 18:26.762
Starburst away and abandoned us.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.721
If we wanted to jump
to conclusions.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.227
You know Crichton's in custody.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.558
What?!
-Mm-hmm.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.894
He kissed some Princess and
now they won't let him go.

18:33.989 --> 18:35.650
Of all the stupid...

18:35.740 --> 18:37.150
You want me to jump to
another conclusion?

18:37.242 --> 18:39.608
He probably wouldn't be in this
dren if it wasn't for you.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.694
Me?!
-Yeah. If you hadn't
rejected him.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.120
It wasn't my door he was last
seen sniffing under.

18:44.207 --> 18:45.708
Some women consider that
a compliment.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.123
Some women have to.

18:47.210 --> 18:50.077
Whoa, whoa whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:50.171 --> 18:53.880
As entertaining as this is at
the moment, it's getting
us nowhere.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.252
Rygel's with Crichton.

18:55.343 --> 18:56.628
When he comes back, we'll
have more information.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.008
As far as Moya goes, I think
we should just wait.

19:00.098 --> 19:03.306
No. You're coming with me and
you're going to show me where
they're keeping Crichton.

19:03.393 --> 19:06.226
We already tried.
They won't let you see him.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.849
Shut up, Chiana.

19:11.568 --> 19:15.527
Ka D'Argo, is it? I don't
believe we've had the pleasure.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.565
I am totally unarmed.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.821
I bear you no ill will.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.948
Perhaps we should, um...

19:25.040 --> 19:27.247
well, reorder...

19:27.334 --> 19:28.699
(snaps fingers)

19:28.793 --> 19:30.829
and share a repast.

19:33.048 --> 19:36.131
I knew there was more to it.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.299
Scorpius.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.092
He doesn't look at all
Peacekeepep

19:40.180 --> 19:43.843
His father was Scarran.
My race.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.060
His mother, Sebacean.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.805
He knows these companions
of Crichton.

19:47.896 --> 19:50.182
Crichton surely works
for Scorpius.

19:50.273 --> 19:55.358
By marrying a spy to your
sister, they gain the advantage
with your dynasty,

19:55.445 --> 19:57.902
and block our advance.

19:57.989 --> 20:02.153
Ah! Forgive my ignorance,
sagacious teacher, I trusted
you to make this work.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.199
Was that unwise of me?

20:04.287 --> 20:09.202
You will rule, not because
you desire it, Clavor,

20:09.292 --> 20:13.877
but because I do.
(thermal hissing)

20:13.963 --> 20:15.578
D'Argo:
This is Scorpius we
are talking about.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.254
Yes, and it's my life, D'Argo.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.583
Look, the Princess is nice.
She's sweet.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.259
And it might be fun to go
shopping for the rest
of my life,

20:22.347 --> 20:24.804
but I am not getting married.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.222
What's the word on Moya?

20:26.309 --> 20:27.890
Nothing. And what difference
does it make, anyway?

20:27.977 --> 20:30.104
Scorpius has a full Command
Carrier out there
waiting for us,

20:30.188 --> 20:33.305
which is probably why Zhaan
and Pilot have taken off.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.015
He's right, you know.

20:35.110 --> 20:37.226
Only place we're safe
is in this palace.

20:37.320 --> 20:39.902
I'm sorry. You saying I
should get married?
-I would.

20:39.989 --> 20:40.944
You're a polygamist.
-John?

20:41.032 --> 20:43.023
What?
-Think it through.

20:43.118 --> 20:45.985
Scorpius has offered me
a deal to turn you in.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.819
What, time share at his
condo in Hell?

20:47.914 --> 20:50.200
He's going to leave the rest of
us alone and he promises not
to destroy your brain

20:50.291 --> 20:53.419
as long as you give him access
to the wormhole technology
in your brain.

20:53.503 --> 20:56.245
And you said...?

20:56.339 --> 20:57.328
That l'd talk to you about it.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.413
That's it.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.338
(annoyed sigh)

20:59.426 --> 21:01.132
l was stalling him, John!

21:01.219 --> 21:04.302
Now, Rygel and l are in
agreement about this
so listen up!

21:04.389 --> 21:07.301
You increase our chances of
figuring something out

21:07.392 --> 21:10.179
the longer you at least pretend
to love this girl.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.430
Love?!Love?!

21:11.521 --> 21:13.057
Rygel, there is no love.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.228
I am the reverse King Arthur.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.180
I'm the one who can put the
sword into the stone.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.391
All right.
So what should we do?

21:17.485 --> 21:18.395
I don't care.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.898
I don't care what you guys do.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.695
I know what I am going to do.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.821
I'm going to tell a nice
girl that I am not her
ticket to the throne.

21:26.911 --> 21:32.031
Pilot, are you certain the
Command Carrier is
not behind us?

21:32.125 --> 21:33.285
Positive.

21:33.376 --> 21:36.368
That was the shortest Starburst
Moya is capable of.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.955
Practically an invitation for
the Peacekeepers to follow.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.960
Then Scorpius has not
taken our bait.

21:42.051 --> 21:46.215
Perhaps he's already aware
Crichton and the others
are down on the planet.

21:46.306 --> 21:49.093
If so, that means we have
abandoned our friends.

21:49.184 --> 21:52.893
There was nothing we could've
done had we stayed, Zhaan.

21:54.856 --> 21:56.812
Turn us around, Pilot.
Immediately.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.312
I will attempt to plot
a course back.

21:59.402 --> 22:04.738
As you know, even a minor
Starburst invalidates all
previous navigation points.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.200
Just do it!

22:06.284 --> 22:07.899
Pa'u Zotoh!

22:07.994 --> 22:11.327
The decision to flee was
a joint one.

22:15.543 --> 22:20.003
Clavor:
Normally, this would be a time
of great joy and celebration.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.341
But I must confess I feel
as if my...

22:22.425 --> 22:26.338
As if you're not going to be
king 'cause I'm going to
marry your sister.

22:26.429 --> 22:29.671
Relax, Ace, I'm not going to
be your brother-in-law.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.302
Is this some sort ofjest?

22:31.392 --> 22:33.553
Jest? No, it's not a jest.

22:33.645 --> 22:35.681
On my planet, we don't marry
people we don't love

22:35.772 --> 22:39.356
unless they're critically-ill
billionaires.

22:39.442 --> 22:41.103
No, just take it easy, bro.

22:41.194 --> 22:45.403
As soon as my ship returns
I'm off this planet,
you get to be king.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.230
Congratulations.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.613
Princess Katralla, it's good
to see you again.

22:51.704 --> 22:55.071
I had given up hope of meeting
a compatible Sebacean man.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.248
Yes, I wanted to talk to
you about that.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.041
Look, I don't know how to say
this so I'm just gonna...

22:59.128 --> 23:00.413
Daughter.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.332
Mother.

23:02.423 --> 23:04.675
You must be John Crichton.

23:04.759 --> 23:08.001
With delight.
-Empress.

23:08.096 --> 23:12.430
I anticipate sturdy
grandchildren from you.
Let us get to know one another.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.301
Have you proposed?

23:16.396 --> 23:17.636
What? No.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.766
No, no, no, no.
I don't love your daughter.

23:19.857 --> 23:22.849
Hmm. How could you?
You just met.

23:22.944 --> 23:24.684
Crichton:
Why don't you let your
son be king?

23:24.779 --> 23:26.189
Novia:
He's a fool.

23:26.281 --> 23:29.489
He would betray our neutrality
for the genuflect of peasants.

23:29.576 --> 23:33.160
And that breach would toll in
hundreds of millions of lives.

23:33.246 --> 23:36.329
Yeah, starting with mine.

23:36.416 --> 23:41.456
l have no purpose for you other
than to keep my empire stable.

23:41.546 --> 23:45.459
If we recognize the Scarrans,
Peacekeepers attack.

23:45.550 --> 23:50.214
Packed with Peacekeepers,
Scarrans invade.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.302
You must wed Katralla.

23:55.393 --> 23:59.011
Empress, I understand your
problems, but you need
to understand,

23:59.105 --> 24:02.222
there's nothing you could say
that's going to make me marry
your daughter.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.609
Oh, hello Crichton.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.861
Something to remember me
by, Crichton.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.408
( screaming )

24:19.500 --> 24:20.706
( screaming )

24:23.546 --> 24:28.165
l have traveled a long, long
way just to see you again.

24:28.259 --> 24:31.467
I hate to say that you
wasted your time, Scorpy,
but you have.

24:31.554 --> 24:35.797
You know that no matter what
you think, the rift between us
need not be terminal.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.177
Go away, Scorpy.

24:37.268 --> 24:40.260
It's over.
Find another girlfriend.

24:40.355 --> 24:43.188
Now, don't let her frighten
you, John, hmm?

24:43.274 --> 24:45.265
Now, you make the
correct decision.

24:49.238 --> 24:53.197
Novius:
My daughter or
that abomination.

24:53.284 --> 24:55.070
Choose.

25:08.299 --> 25:09.163
Bad?

25:09.258 --> 25:10.213
Enough.

25:10.301 --> 25:11.677
She's strong and gets
what she wants.

25:11.761 --> 25:12.750
What about you?

25:12.845 --> 25:14.426
Rarely.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.881
So what do you want?

25:18.267 --> 25:20.178
To be Empress.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.725
To have children.

25:21.813 --> 25:24.179
To keep the peace
for my people.

25:24.273 --> 25:26.980
Even if we're miserable for
the rest of our lives?

25:27.068 --> 25:29.275
lwon't make you miserable.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.029
I'm sorry.

25:40.581 --> 25:43.414
Princess Katralla...

25:44.711 --> 25:47.327
will you consent to marry me?

25:48.506 --> 25:50.371
Yes.

26:06.691 --> 26:08.477
Aeryn:
What do you mean,
you have no choice?

26:08.568 --> 26:11.776
Crichton:
No choice.
Rock, me, hard place.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.945
Fight, retreat, remain silent.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.441
Scorpius. The Empress?

26:15.533 --> 26:16.818
You disappoint me, Crichton.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.070
You should lower your
expectations.

26:19.162 --> 26:20.777
Well, at least the Princess
is pretty.

26:20.872 --> 26:21.736
Yeah, I guess so.

26:21.831 --> 26:22.490
And wealthy.

26:22.582 --> 26:23.571
I suppose so.

26:23.666 --> 26:24.951
Think of all the power
yoquhave.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.373
Yeah, I can't stop
thinking about it.

26:26.461 --> 26:27.826
That, and how I'm going to
get off this planet

26:27.920 --> 26:29.706
the way I got here,
single and alive.

26:29.797 --> 26:32.504
Well, I'll see what I can do...
-Congratulations.

26:33.176 --> 26:34.086
Sorry?

26:34.177 --> 26:36.133
Marrying our Princess.

26:36.220 --> 26:39.508
Dregon Karzenova,
Cousin to the Crown.

26:39.599 --> 26:41.555
John Crichton, Astronaut.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.391
Katralla's a lovely girl.

26:44.479 --> 26:46.219
| wish you great happiness.

26:46.314 --> 26:48.054
And, uh, you would be?

26:48.149 --> 26:51.641
Extremely preoccupied.
Excuse me.

26:51.736 --> 26:53.522
Perhaps some other time, then.

26:53.613 --> 26:54.944
We'll do lunch.

26:55.031 --> 26:56.066
Seemed like a nice guy.

26:56.157 --> 26:56.987
Stop it.

26:57.074 --> 26:58.325
So, any word on Moya?

26:58.409 --> 27:01.651
I think she got spooked by
Scorpius's Command Carrier.

27:01.746 --> 27:03.236
Yeah, spook.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.788
Spooky. That's a good name for
him. He has that effect.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.957
On you?
-On everybody.

27:08.044 --> 27:10.330
How many guards have you seen
since you got up here?

27:10.421 --> 27:11.831
Too many.

27:11.923 --> 27:13.788
That's right.

27:13.883 --> 27:17.216
They're protecting me,
from him.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.134
Look, the Empress, this
is her ball game,

27:19.222 --> 27:21.213
but if you have some
suggestions, now would
be a good time.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.172
I'm just trying to figure out
what they're hiding from us.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.974
Well, see if you can figure out
someone else to marry
the Princess.

27:26.062 --> 27:27.427
And if I can't?

27:27.522 --> 27:30.229
Better wed than dead.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.556
Hmm.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.521
Katralla:
Oh, Tyno.

27:38.616 --> 27:42.700
I believe my mother will
truly force me to marry
this stranger.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.527
We can only hope.

27:44.622 --> 27:45.828
"We can only hope"?!

27:45.915 --> 27:47.780
What am I supposed to say,
Katralla?

27:47.875 --> 27:50.992
You're supposed to say,
"No, stop this travesty."

27:51.087 --> 27:53.328
You're supposed to say, "I will
not let you marry that man."

27:53.422 --> 27:59.292
You're supposed to take me
away from this madness
that is my life.

27:59.387 --> 28:02.800
There's too much at stake to
stop this now. You must
exchange espousals.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.596
But I love you.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.675
As I love you.

28:07.937 --> 28:10.223
But our union is not
destined to be.

28:25.288 --> 28:27.279
You must go to Crichton.

28:28.916 --> 28:31.293
You must do your duty.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.377
Crichton is such a
frelling fool!

28:35.464 --> 28:36.920
He had no choice.

28:37.008 --> 28:38.464
Oh, please.

28:38.551 --> 28:41.258
Princess Pretend doesn't
even love him.

28:41.345 --> 28:42.926
She wants that Tyno.

28:43.014 --> 28:44.174
You're forgetting about
Scorpius.

28:44.265 --> 28:46.051
We can hide from him in
the barren lands

28:46.142 --> 28:47.632
outside the city
until he leaves.

28:47.727 --> 28:50.093
Marrying her is the only thing
that will save Crichton's
life, Aeryn.

28:50.187 --> 28:52.473
Don't you get that?
-l have had just about
enough of you.

28:52.565 --> 28:55.102
No, no, no, it's not me
that you're mad at.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.774
You should have told him how
you felt when you had a chance.

28:57.862 --> 29:00.103
You don't know anything.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.654
Yeah? Well, I know about men.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.357
You see that one over there?

29:04.452 --> 29:06.738
How many times has he tried
to come on to you?

29:06.829 --> 29:08.990
What, three, four?

29:09.081 --> 29:11.993
Look, he's well-bred,
he's rich,

29:12.084 --> 29:14.666
handsome, perfect.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.540
You're going to let him
get away, too.

29:16.631 --> 29:18.337
You know why?

29:18.424 --> 29:20.460
Oh, go on, tell me.

29:20.551 --> 29:23.213
Because you only want the
ones you can't have.

29:23.304 --> 29:25.295
So you're going to go to
Crichton, you're going to
mess with his mind.

29:25.389 --> 29:27.596
He's going to be turned over
to Scorpius, and dead.

29:27.683 --> 29:30.299
This marriage is wrong,
and you both know it.

29:33.356 --> 29:36.268
Zhaan:
Pilot, why are we still moving
further away from the Royal Planet?

29:36.359 --> 29:41.319
Moya is following a signal of
some sort, and refuses to
give up the trail.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.691
Does she know that Scorpius
did not follow us?

29:43.783 --> 29:46.695
Does she know that we have to
return to the planet to
help our friends?

29:46.786 --> 29:49.653
Yes, but she's driven forward.

29:49.747 --> 29:51.237
What sort of a signal
is it, Pilot?

29:51.332 --> 29:54.495
Impossible to describe to
our satisfaction,

29:54.585 --> 29:58.328
but one of her eight senses
clearly identifies it as...

29:58.422 --> 30:01.585
familiar and compelling.

30:11.352 --> 30:13.308
Oh, perfect.

30:13.396 --> 30:16.012
I don't believe I've had
the pleasure.

30:16.107 --> 30:17.938
Yes, I've heard that
about Scarrans.

30:18.025 --> 30:23.190
Perhaps we could talk for
a moment, in private.

30:32.248 --> 30:35.285
l have a message for Scorpius.

30:35.376 --> 30:36.707
Scorpius?

30:36.794 --> 30:41.333
I know you work together.
I saw your Luxan with him.

30:41.424 --> 30:42.960
Go ahead.

30:43.050 --> 30:46.258
We will not tolerate your
interference so far out
in what you

30:46.345 --> 30:50.213
condescendingly call the
Uncharted Territories.

30:50.307 --> 30:51.262
Is there anything else?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.056
Yes.

30:53.144 --> 30:57.604
Is your presence here the
vanguard of a larger
invading force?

30:58.983 --> 31:01.520
I shall send your regards
to Scorpius.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.693
I had hoped to learn your
mind by conversation.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.771
However, if I must invade it...

31:06.866 --> 31:08.322
(grunts)

31:11.412 --> 31:12.993
( growls )

31:15.416 --> 31:16.201
( bones cracking )

31:16.292 --> 31:17.327
(grunts)

31:21.881 --> 31:23.417
( growls )

31:30.765 --> 31:32.847
Don't stop now.

31:32.933 --> 31:34.798
Go on, kill each other.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.725
Save me the trouble.

31:37.271 --> 31:39.603
My apologies Empress.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.806
I rarely bother with warnings.

31:41.901 --> 31:45.314
Consider yourself the
beneficiary of largesse.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.113
Empress.

31:51.285 --> 31:53.401
Listen carefully, Peacekeeper.

31:53.496 --> 31:56.988
The longer Crichton plays the
part he's been assigned,

31:57.083 --> 32:00.166
the more likely we'll keep
our internal organs...

32:00.252 --> 32:02.288
internal.

32:02.379 --> 32:05.246
Do not dissuade him from
this marriage.

32:05.341 --> 32:08.208
Thank you, Rygel.
I'll do what I think is right.

32:08.302 --> 32:11.339
For Crichton, or for you?

32:12.223 --> 32:13.804
(sighs)

32:21.524 --> 32:23.230
Just a small burn, Princess.

32:23.317 --> 32:25.228
( instrument beeping)

32:26.904 --> 32:28.269
Almost finished.

32:28.364 --> 32:32.198
Crichton:
You know, you take any more
samples of my DNA

32:32.284 --> 32:34.240
there's not going to be
enough left to be me.

32:34.328 --> 32:36.785
What species are you?

32:36.872 --> 32:38.737
Since you're not Sebacean.

32:38.833 --> 32:43.293
Human. I keep trying to tell you
guys that, but nobody seems
to want to listen.

32:44.755 --> 32:47.246
The Empress has ordered
the revelation sealed.

32:47.341 --> 32:48.751
No one will ever know.

32:48.843 --> 32:51.425
It's that important that I
marry the Princess?

32:52.930 --> 32:58.095
Our dynastic integrity has
always ensured peace.

32:58.185 --> 33:02.178
Any fracture, and the whole
region could erupt.

33:02.273 --> 33:04.138
Then why don't you marry her?

33:05.776 --> 33:08.108
Her DNA was poisoned.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.895
Unreceptive to anyone,

33:11.782 --> 33:13.318
until you.

33:13.409 --> 33:15.900
Katralla:
Would you activate the machine
for me, please?

33:21.584 --> 33:23.040
Her brother.

33:24.295 --> 33:27.002
Very discerning.

33:27.089 --> 33:30.877
With help, we believe,
from the Scarran Emissary.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.752
Katralla:
John. Come look.

33:34.847 --> 33:37.805
Rygel:
Oh, this is truly
amazing, Crichton.

33:37.892 --> 33:40.224
I must have one for my kingdom.

33:41.187 --> 33:42.723
Katralla:
Boy or girl?

33:42.813 --> 33:43.973
I'm sorry, what?

33:44.064 --> 33:47.227
The DNA testing confirms
our incipient kiss.

33:47.318 --> 33:50.731
Our children will be
healthy, disease free.

33:50.821 --> 33:53.153
Rygel:
And you can see what
they'll be like.

33:53.240 --> 33:57.609
Oh, how many nasty surprises
could I have avoided?

33:57.703 --> 33:58.613
( Rygel laughs)

33:59.705 --> 34:01.161
Male infant, please.

34:01.248 --> 34:03.330
(instrument beeps and hums)

34:05.085 --> 34:06.586
(giggling)

34:07.213 --> 34:08.828
Oh...

34:13.302 --> 34:16.009
Hey, buddy, what's up?

34:16.096 --> 34:17.711
Where'd you come from?

34:17.806 --> 34:18.795
( baby cries )

34:18.891 --> 34:20.847
Crichton:
Look at you, slugger.

34:20.935 --> 34:22.266
(giggIeS)

34:24.855 --> 34:29.474
This is... this is what our
child would look like.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.150
One possibility.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.948
The choice is ours.

34:35.032 --> 34:36.647
Crichton:
Hey, you the man.

34:36.742 --> 34:37.652
(giggIeS)

34:37.743 --> 34:39.244
Crichton:
You the man.

34:39.328 --> 34:41.660
Would you like to see
him grown-up?

34:41.747 --> 34:43.408
Yes, please.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.289
Not, not too grown-up.

34:49.213 --> 34:50.669
Hi, Dad.

34:50.756 --> 34:53.213
Rygel:
An astounding device!

34:53.300 --> 34:56.087
Oh, uh... looks just like you.

34:56.178 --> 34:58.419
( laughs )
Yeah, he does, kind of.

34:58.514 --> 35:01.847
Yet, he may be able to
overcome it.

35:07.398 --> 35:09.138
Thank you.

35:09.233 --> 35:10.518
That's all.

35:14.196 --> 35:18.781
Tyno:
Not to be obtrusive, but the
royal tailor would like to see you for a fitting.

35:18.867 --> 35:22.234
You're scheduled to meet
members of the royal
family court,

35:22.329 --> 35:25.321
and you must work on a pose
for your Governance Statue.

35:25.416 --> 35:26.280
Statue?

35:26.375 --> 35:28.331
( laughs )
Get out of town.

35:28.419 --> 35:30.580
All right, fine. Well, on
Earth, we have this queen.

35:30.671 --> 35:33.708
She's got this wave.

35:34.258 --> 35:35.748
I'll do that.

35:35.843 --> 35:39.586
Hardly a pose you'd like to
hold for 80 cycles, I'm afraid.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.342
Wh... well, what 80 cycles?

35:43.892 --> 35:45.632
| just assumed you knew.

35:47.396 --> 35:49.227
Knew what?!

35:50.774 --> 35:52.765
Clavor:
Crichton's DNA is compatible!

35:52.860 --> 35:53.975
It's not a trick!

35:54.069 --> 35:56.606
Then your loyalists must
assassinate him.

35:56.697 --> 36:00.030
You really frelled up this
time, Cargn. This is not
part of our bargain.

36:00.117 --> 36:03.280
Scorpius is here because your
mother let him attend.

36:03.370 --> 36:05.577
Ah, so, now it's my
mother's fault?

36:05.664 --> 36:07.575
l have half a mind to tell
her about you.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.906
(menacing growl)

36:09.001 --> 36:10.616
(strangled grunt)

36:10.711 --> 36:15.250
You do have half a mind,
Your Highness.

36:15.341 --> 36:20.085
But will you actually
reveal our pact?

36:20.179 --> 36:26.846
Can you see past childishness
to realize any betrayal means
your instant death,

36:26.935 --> 36:29.187
even if mine follows?

36:29.271 --> 36:31.307
(strangled):
Yes.

36:31.398 --> 36:33.013
(strangled groan)

36:33.108 --> 36:37.272
I am curious, dear Jenavian,

36:37.363 --> 36:42.073
to know of your loyalties.

36:42.159 --> 36:46.698
As | interrogated your
loving fiance,

36:46.789 --> 36:52.000
what was going through your
delicate little mind?

36:52.086 --> 36:55.544
( grunting ):
l was hoping you wouldn't wear
that to our wedding.

36:58.634 --> 37:01.125
( retching )

37:01.220 --> 37:05.338
Destiny's couple, you are.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.186
Why has Moya brought us
here, Pilot?

37:16.276 --> 37:17.186
I don't know.

37:17.277 --> 37:20.360
Moya continues to be
evasive with me.

37:20.447 --> 37:24.281
However, I assume it has
something to do with that.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.284
What is it, Pilot?

37:28.372 --> 37:29.452
Is it alive?

37:29.540 --> 37:30.996
Yes.

37:32.084 --> 37:34.746
Does Moya know this
living thing?

37:34.837 --> 37:36.293
Yes.

37:37.423 --> 37:39.163
Who is it?

37:40.926 --> 37:43.212
The Builders.

37:44.388 --> 37:46.174
Her Creators.

37:46.723 --> 37:49.886
Her god.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.348
( passionate groan )

37:54.231 --> 37:56.768
Did you hear about the statue?

37:56.859 --> 37:58.565
Hey, Chiana.

37:58.652 --> 38:00.643
80 cycles. 80 cycles.

38:00.737 --> 38:04.776
That is roughly 80 years
to you and me, and...

38:04.867 --> 38:07.324
over 500 years to dogs!

38:10.330 --> 38:13.288
Why don't you stay and
tell us about it, John?

38:15.794 --> 38:17.409
(panting sigh)

38:20.424 --> 38:26.670
Did you know about the statue
when you were convincing me to
marry the Princess?

38:27.514 --> 38:29.254
I don't know about it now.

38:29.349 --> 38:32.261
After we're married, and I mean
right after we're married,

38:32.352 --> 38:34.183
they turn us into statues.

38:36.106 --> 38:39.940
That is fascinating.

38:41.278 --> 38:42.939
Excellent.

38:43.030 --> 38:45.396
D'Argo discovers science.

38:46.408 --> 38:47.989
To what purpose?

38:48.076 --> 38:49.452
( exasperated sigh )

38:49.536 --> 38:53.120
Governing Continuity. They screw
with our molecular structure,

38:53.207 --> 38:55.949
turn us into pigeon perches and
we preside over their senate

38:56.043 --> 38:58.329
or whatever they call it,
for 80 cycles.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.160
As a statue?

39:00.255 --> 39:03.839
Yeah. We can see, we can hear,
don't ask me how,

39:03.926 --> 39:07.885
and we're supposed to absorb
every single facet of their
governmental system.

39:07.971 --> 39:13.216
That way, when mom and pops
finally kick it, we rule.

39:13.310 --> 39:18.054
Perhaps that's why they've
endured 1,900 cycles of peace.
It works.

39:19.566 --> 39:21.181
You're like a brochure.

39:30.244 --> 39:32.530
You have to go through
with it, John.

39:33.163 --> 39:36.246
80 cycles.

39:37.626 --> 39:40.709
My college loans will
be delinquent.

39:40.796 --> 39:43.162
I'll miss the strippers on
my hundredth birthday.

39:43.257 --> 39:45.168
I'll get a utility bill

39:45.259 --> 39:49.628
for three trillion dollars for
a single porch light that
I left on

39:49.721 --> 39:53.088
and everybody I know
will be dead!

39:56.395 --> 40:02.311
The alternative is having your
brain dissected by Scorpius.

40:04.152 --> 40:12.651
Humans do not live as long as
Sebaceans or Hynerians
or Delvians.

40:13.579 --> 40:18.198
When I get back, everyone,

40:18.292 --> 40:21.284
my Dad, D.K., my sisters,

40:21.378 --> 40:26.088
Cameron Diaz, Buffy the Vampire
Slayer, will be dead.

40:27.259 --> 40:30.126
Well, you may never see these
people again anyway.

40:34.808 --> 40:38.016
Hope, D'Argo.

40:38.895 --> 40:41.227
It's what keeps you going.

40:41.315 --> 40:43.271
You're gonna see your son.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.189
I'm gonna get home.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.564
Hope.

40:50.532 --> 40:53.148
l have hope...

40:54.119 --> 40:56.280
or I'm nothing.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.543
Look at what fate has
given you.

41:05.631 --> 41:09.089
Scorpius will no longer
be a threat.

41:09.176 --> 41:16.218
And as a ruler, you'll have
power, peace, prosperity.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.885
You could, uh, create a family.

41:22.230 --> 41:26.018
Perhaps you've only just
discovered your true destiny.

41:27.944 --> 41:32.313
Hey, you've been spending way
too much time with Chiana,
you know that?

41:32.407 --> 41:35.740
Amongst all the fluff,
she can make a lot of sense.

41:38.914 --> 41:42.452
Our time was good, John.

41:42.542 --> 41:46.330
We had each other when
we needed each other.

41:46.421 --> 41:53.293
But now it's time to go past
your fears, see what's
down the road ahead.

41:57.099 --> 41:59.306
If I do this...

42:00.644 --> 42:02.885
you have to be my best man.

42:05.399 --> 42:06.980
Uh...

42:08.235 --> 42:11.602
I'm with Chiana now, John.

42:23.125 --> 42:24.706
Do you talk?

42:24.793 --> 42:27.205
When asked to, Highness.

42:27.295 --> 42:29.422
So, uh...

42:31.800 --> 42:33.131
you work for the Royal Family.

42:33.218 --> 42:37.587
For 22 cycles. Since Katralla
and Clavor were children.

42:37.681 --> 42:40.343
I'm happy she has found you
as a mate, Highness.

42:40.434 --> 42:43.847
No, uh, lose the
"Highness" part.

42:43.937 --> 42:45.268
l'm John. Call me that.

42:45.355 --> 42:47.516
I am ro-NA.
-ro-NA...

42:47.607 --> 42:49.859
Aeryn:
Could you give us a
moment alone, please?

42:49.943 --> 42:52.059
So, you're going to listen to
D'Argo over me, are you?
Is that right?

42:52.154 --> 42:55.612
The Empress has made it clear.
I marry her daughter or she
hands me to Scorpius.

42:55.699 --> 42:56.859
80 cycles as a statue?

42:56.950 --> 42:58.451
It's better than Scorpius!

42:58.535 --> 43:00.150
Is it?

43:02.873 --> 43:04.829
He's in my head.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.916
Back of my mind,
corner of my eye.

43:09.004 --> 43:11.370
He scares me, Aeryn,
and I can't shake him.

43:11.465 --> 43:12.921
I don't know what you're
talking about,

43:13.008 --> 43:15.545
but there's never been anything
we couldn't overcome together.

43:20.807 --> 43:22.889
Except each other.

43:33.195 --> 43:34.605
I can't come to the wedding.

43:36.823 --> 43:38.154
I want you there.

43:38.241 --> 43:39.276
Don't be absurd.

43:39.367 --> 43:41.278
I need you there.

43:43.872 --> 43:45.703
Aeryn, l...

43:49.336 --> 43:53.295
don't you think that there
are things to say?

43:53.381 --> 43:58.341
At this point, what else can
we say except goodbye?

44:02.015 --> 44:03.380
You're right.

44:06.645 --> 44:08.260
You're always right.

44:16.822 --> 44:18.278
Bye.

44:21.993 --> 44:24.109
(sighing)

44:24.204 --> 44:26.490
Welcome to Barbie world.

44:26.581 --> 44:30.199
They're almost ready
for you, Highness.

44:31.127 --> 44:32.253
(grunting)

44:50.814 --> 44:54.181
Here's your wedding present
from Prince Clavor.

44:56.069 --> 44:57.934
( screaming )
