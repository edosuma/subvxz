01:40.726 --> 01:44.103
Time travel has not yet been invented.

01:44.271 --> 01:47.398
But 30 years from now,
it will have been.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.361
It will be instantly outlawed...

01:52.529 --> 01:57.408
used only in secret
by the largest criminal organizations.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.798
It's nearly impossible
to dispose of a body in the future.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.426
I'm told. Tagging techniques, whatnot.

02:15.594 --> 02:19.597
So when these criminal organizations
in the future need someone gone...

02:19.765 --> 02:25.019
they use specialized assassins
in our present called loopers.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.522
And so...

02:27.689 --> 02:30.900
my employers in the future
nab the target.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.653
They zap him back to me, their looper.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.824
He appears,
hands tied and head sacked.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.284
And I do the necessaries.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.829
Collect my silver.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.082
So the target is vanished
from the future...

02:46.250 --> 02:49.961
and I've just disposed of a body
that technically does not exist.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.924
Clean.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.812
- How's the French?
- Slow.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.356
- How's the coffee?
- Burnt.

03:22.578 --> 03:26.873
Devil bring you into hell!
You have to heal yourself.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.053
Two, Jed.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.645
Hey, Joe.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.732
- Be at the club tonight?
- Yeah.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.525
Four, Jed.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.132
Hey, walk around.

05:00.509 --> 05:04.011
Around the bike. I'm not kidding!
Wide, around, you shit!

05:04.179 --> 05:06.973
Rude! If you had a mama,
she didn't raise you right.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.601
That's funny. I'm going to pick
your mother up later on my bike...

05:10.769 --> 05:13.479
- and I'm gonna take my blunderbuss...
- Hey, Seth.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.023
- Hey, Joe.
- That's new.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.817
Yeah, thanks.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.987
Goddamn thing won't fucking start.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.906
So you going to the Belle?

05:25.784 --> 05:28.327
- So you bought a slat bike?
- Yup.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.997
How much that thing set you back?
How much?

05:31.164 --> 05:33.124
I was gonna pull up in it tonight.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.293
Well, congratulations.
You're pulling up with me instead.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.422
Don't. If we're going in, don't do that.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.341
- Chicks dig TKs.
- They do not.

05:42.509 --> 05:46.387
- Yes, they do.
- It's tacky. Don't do it.

05:47.139 --> 05:52.685
About 10 percent of the population
has this TK mutation.

05:52.853 --> 05:56.147
When it first appeared, everyone thought
we were gonna get superheroes.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.317
But it turns out this was it.
Now it's a bunch of assholes...

06:01.737 --> 06:03.817
think they're blowing your mind
floating quarters.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.959
It's like this whole town.

06:17.127 --> 06:20.588
Big heads, small potatoes.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.974
- Full house tonight, Joe.
- We'll stick backstage.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.685
- Just meeting up.
- Packing your blunderbusses?

06:34.853 --> 06:36.854
- Hardly. Right, Seth?
- I'm with Joe.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.356
- Just meeting up, in and out.
- Go on.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.113
Suzie!

06:46.281 --> 06:48.741
- Hey!
- You working a shift tonight?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.493
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

06:50.660 --> 06:53.120
A gat man bought me out
already for the night.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.000
Sweetie, I've got to work.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.844
Hey, Joe.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.645
- What?
- Zach. He's in there right now with Abe.

07:17.813 --> 07:20.147
- For what?
- Closed his loop.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.149
No shit?

07:24.236 --> 07:27.279
There's a reason we're called loopers.

07:28.698 --> 07:32.701
When we sign up for this job,
taking out the future's garbage...

07:32.869 --> 07:36.330
we also agree
to a very specific proviso.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.210
Time travel in the future is so illegal...

07:41.378 --> 07:44.421
that when our employers
want to close our contracts...

07:44.589 --> 07:49.093
they'll also want to erase any trace of
their relationship with us ever existing.

07:51.513 --> 07:54.974
So if we're still alive
30 years from now...

07:55.142 --> 07:59.937
they'll find our older self,
zap him back to us...

08:00.105 --> 08:03.065
and we'll kill him like any otherjob.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.736
This is called closing your loop.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.449
You get a golden payday,
you get a handshake...

08:12.617 --> 08:14.827
and you get released
from your contract.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.454
Enjoy the next 30 years.

08:18.248 --> 08:22.626
This job doesn't tend to attract
the most forward-thinking people.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.588
So we celebrating?

08:25.755 --> 08:27.923
Yeah! Yeah!

09:04.377 --> 09:05.628
Look out!

09:06.880 --> 09:08.422
Shit.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.594
Jesus.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.804
Fuck, Joe.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.301
What, fourth loop closed this month?

09:54.469 --> 09:56.512
Loop closed. Here we go.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.736
Loop closed, baby!

10:45.145 --> 10:46.603
Yeah.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.036
Seth?

11:02.203 --> 11:03.954
Jesus.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.249
They could be here any minute.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.001
- Are they here?
- No. Who?

11:09.169 --> 11:13.172
Oh, Christ. Joe, Christ!

11:13.840 --> 11:15.799
- What are you doing?
- Give me the gun.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.551
Oh, right. That's smart.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.762
- Get away from the window.
- Christ, Joe.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.097
- Just quiet down.
- You can protect me.

11:22.265 --> 11:23.932
- So they...
- What did you do?

11:24.100 --> 11:27.102
Oh, jeez. This is like a nightmare.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.646
This is a nightmare.

11:29.814 --> 11:33.192
I knew then what he did,
so I don't know why I asked.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.110
What did you do?

11:36.613 --> 11:40.491
He... He was singing.

11:42.577 --> 11:46.372
Through the gag and sack,
but I could hear the tune.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.291
Deep memories...

11:49.459 --> 11:52.252
my mom in a dark room...

11:52.420 --> 11:55.339
taking care of me, singing that tune.

11:57.425 --> 12:01.762
Once I knew he was me...

12:07.602 --> 12:09.186
Joe, I couldn't.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.356
I couldn't. I had to see.

12:14.859 --> 12:18.946
He told me... I remember, he told me...

12:19.656 --> 12:23.534
there's a new holy terror boss man
in the future...

12:23.701 --> 12:26.286
and he's closing all the loops.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.956
The Rainmaker, they call him.

12:29.749 --> 12:34.002
He told me it.
Then he wanted a cigarette.

12:34.170 --> 12:38.757
So I untied him,
and he gives me this look.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.303
And he just starts running.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.806
I had my blunderbuss...

12:45.974 --> 12:49.435
so I know I've got about 15 strides
until he's out of my range.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.770
And they come and they go...

12:53.064 --> 12:56.316
and I just watch him until he's gone.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.319
This is called letting your loop run.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.321
It's not a good thing.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.365
What do I do?

13:04.659 --> 13:08.495
You're the only friend I've got, Joe.
You've got to help me.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.416
You're a fucking idiot coming here.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.170
You can't be here.
I'll give you some money.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.381
Joe! A little money?
Where am I gonna go?

13:19.549 --> 13:22.676
You hop a freight train.
You beat it the hell out of town.

13:28.725 --> 13:30.642
Just don't move.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.771
Tell Court, watch the window outside.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.607
You got it, window.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.152
- Kid Blue, Joe! Come on!
- Just a minute!

13:40.320 --> 13:43.780
- Open this goddamn door!
- I can't do anything for you, Seth.

13:43.948 --> 13:47.743
You've got to hide me!
Please, Joe! Hide me!

13:47.911 --> 13:51.997
Please! Just buy me some time
and then I'll go! Please?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.124
You gonna make me
blow this door down?

13:54.292 --> 13:56.001
Yeah, hold on!

13:57.337 --> 13:58.837
Please?

13:59.964 --> 14:01.423
Move. Move.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.551
Come on, Joe! Open up!

14:13.686 --> 14:15.771
Jesus.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.991
- That took a while.
- You think it's easy looking this good?

14:28.159 --> 14:32.079
Tye's gonna watch your apartment while
we go have a talk with Abe.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.748
There's coffee in the tin.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.208
Thank you.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.145
Give me two minutes.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.579
Know why they call that pea shooter
of yours a blunderbuss?

15:14.122 --> 15:17.666
Because it's impossible to hit anything
farther than 15 yards.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.502
Impossible to miss anything closer.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.839
It's a gun for fuck-up turkeys.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.591
Not like a gat.

15:26.718 --> 15:30.178
A gat has range.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.848
Accuracy.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.436
Kid, cut it out.
Don't blow your other foot off.

16:02.837 --> 16:05.756
- Fuck!
- What the hell is going on out there?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.800
- How you doing, Abe?
- Hey, Joe.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.970
You didn't shoot your other foot off,
did you, Kid?

16:15.183 --> 16:16.558
All right.

16:17.810 --> 16:23.065
My great-grandfather told my
grandfather, "Men are like spiders."

16:24.067 --> 16:26.735
It's the little ones
you've got to be careful of."

16:26.903 --> 16:29.154
Don't know I agree with that.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.739
Yeah?

16:31.908 --> 16:34.451
What the fuck
did my great-grandfather know?

16:34.619 --> 16:36.745
This man is from the future.

16:36.913 --> 16:41.041
He was sent back here by the mob,
a one-way ticket, to run the loopers.

16:41.209 --> 16:44.044
That's low effort, even for Abe,
so to pass the time...

16:44.212 --> 16:48.256
he recruited some real muscle,
the gat men. Now he runs the city.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.593
Any other city,
that would be impressive.

17:04.232 --> 17:07.317
How can you kids
stand to wear those chokers?

17:08.819 --> 17:10.028
- Cravats?
- Ties.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.906
Ridiculous. You're aware
we don't have a dress code?

17:13.324 --> 17:15.867
- Fashion.
- You know... Well, you don't know.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.538
The movies that you're dressing like
are just copying other movies.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.709
These goddamn 20th century
affectations.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.544
Do something new.

17:25.712 --> 17:30.674
Put a glowing thing
around your neck or use rubberized...

17:31.467 --> 17:33.301
- Just be new.
- Okay.

17:39.559 --> 17:43.437
- It was nice chatting with you, Abe.
- I do like you, Joe.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.398
But we're sure enough
that Seth paid you a visit.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.358
- We have to do something.
- Seth?

17:48.526 --> 17:51.945
You're expecting we're gonna
break your fingers with a hammer...

17:52.113 --> 17:53.572
or something awful.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.409
But I'm gonna defuse that tension right
now. That's not gonna happen.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.371
What is gonna happen
is that I'm gonna talk for a little.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.540
Not even that long.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.876
And you're gonna give up
your friend.

18:06.043 --> 18:10.172
My friend? Seth? Sorry, I'm confused.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.174
Well, then I'll talk a little.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.260
You know, you were the youngest looper
I ever hired.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.430
You looked goddamn ridiculous,
they said.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.850
Blunderbuss up to here on you.

18:22.018 --> 18:25.729
- They brought you in. I forget what for.
- Watch shop.

18:25.897 --> 18:29.733
Yeah. You rolled one of our fronts,
a watch shop.

18:30.526 --> 18:34.571
And they had you, you know.
This kid, like an animal.

18:34.739 --> 18:38.533
But you looked at me,
your hair stuck to half your face...

18:38.701 --> 18:41.995
just one eye looking at me.
I could see...

18:42.580 --> 18:47.042
like seeing it happen on the TV,
the bad version of your life.

18:47.210 --> 18:52.714
Like a vision,
I could see how you'd turn bad.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.883
So I changed it.

18:55.510 --> 18:59.179
I cleaned you up
and put a gun in your hand.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.100
- I gave you something that was yours.
- I'm grateful for that, Abe.

19:04.268 --> 19:08.021
I gave you something that was yours.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.608
And I remember that kid.

19:13.861 --> 19:18.657
And I think if you ask yourself, you ask,
"Who would I sacrifice for what's mine?"

19:18.825 --> 19:22.577
I think Seth would be deep and cozy
inside that circle.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.749
I'll show you how much I know you.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.920
I'm not even gonna break you.
I'm just gonna set you back a ways.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.550
We know that you've been stashing
half your bars.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.719
Which is smart, no law against it.
You're gonna get out.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.681
You're gonna go overseas.
Studying up your Mandarin?

19:42.849 --> 19:45.058
- French.
- French?

19:47.061 --> 19:51.106
You give him up
or you give us half your stash.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.651
You willing to dump
your silver in the dirt...

19:55.027 --> 19:56.862
for Seth?

20:06.414 --> 20:08.331
You're gonna kill him.

20:08.499 --> 20:13.003
Not if we can help it. Be too cataclysmic
a change for the future.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.922
What we'll do is dangerous
in that regards...

20:16.090 --> 20:18.258
though not as dangerous
as killing him.

20:18.426 --> 20:22.596
On top of which, a man from the future
runs free long enough...

20:22.847 --> 20:26.933
this time travel shit
fries your brain like an egg.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.393
Why the fuck French?

20:29.395 --> 20:30.979
I'm going to France.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.732
- You should go to China.
- I'm going to France.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.318
I'm from the future.
You should go to China.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.778
- I'm going to France.
- You're going...

20:50.583 --> 20:53.126
The floor safe, under the rug.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.004
Six seven four two.

21:01.552 --> 21:04.054
It's the little ones that get you.

21:10.353 --> 21:14.522
Why don't you kill an hour, Joe.
On the house.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.695
Call the doc.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.294
Wait.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.338
Wait!

23:04.383 --> 23:05.884
Wait.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.536
You know,
I can't remember my mother's face.

24:15.204 --> 24:19.332
She used to run her hands
through my hair.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.506
Just like this.

24:43.566 --> 24:46.901
I think I just let my best friend
get killed tonight.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.445
For silver.

24:55.578 --> 24:56.870
Shit.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.413
Yeah.

24:59.290 --> 25:00.832
Shit.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.045
Sorry.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.425
I'm gonna give you some money.

25:10.593 --> 25:14.429
I've been stashing my silver for years
and I'm gonna give you half of it.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.473
You can raise your kid right.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.559
You wanna give me half your silver?

25:19.727 --> 25:23.730
Silver's got strings. I got my job.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.525
You got yours.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.696
It's sweet of you to worry about me,
but I'm doing fine.

25:33.657 --> 25:36.701
Why don't we just stick
to services rendered.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.583
Is this what you want?

27:48.083 --> 27:49.417
Shit!

29:29.435 --> 29:32.520
Then it just becomes a mess,
like a pig fucking a football.

29:32.688 --> 29:35.565
You know what I'm saying.
Let's finish this up.

29:38.402 --> 29:41.362
There's 24 there. I'm keeping count.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.741
Two more trips should just do it.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.056
Goddamn it!

30:12.644 --> 30:15.396
Kid, I'm sorry!
Tell Abe I'm gonna fix this!

30:15.564 --> 30:19.984
Tell him I'm gonna find my loop
and I'm gonna kill him! Tell Abe...

30:21.612 --> 30:23.070
Motherfucker!

34:03.625 --> 34:05.418
Rainmaker...

36:31.439 --> 36:32.523
Shit!

36:56.464 --> 36:58.299
You got any aspirin?

36:58.592 --> 37:00.509
All of them, please.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.849
I'll take that coat, too.

37:26.119 --> 37:28.162
What are you doing?

37:30.540 --> 37:33.792
What are you doing?
Joe, I told you to run.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.735
Don't do it, you idiot.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.824
Hurry up, Blue!

38:06.159 --> 38:10.412
That's the second loop we had run
this week. It's getting endemic.

38:12.332 --> 38:13.874
Fucking Kid Blue.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.377
About two more trips should do it.

38:54.290 --> 38:55.958
Shit.

39:17.230 --> 39:19.565
You stupid little shit.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.618
Pound the pavement,
sweep the train yard.

39:31.786 --> 39:35.664
Every second that passes is bad.
Get on it.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.208
Stupid little shit.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.252
I can fix this.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.756
- I can find him!
- Go home.

39:43.923 --> 39:45.799
Let the grownups work.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.969
Kid Blue.

40:26.424 --> 40:30.302
You bastard. How do I find you?

42:38.556 --> 42:39.598
Coffee?

42:41.851 --> 42:43.435
Please.

42:44.020 --> 42:46.438
Black. And some water.

42:46.606 --> 42:48.148
Anything else?

42:49.025 --> 42:50.484
We eating?

42:51.361 --> 42:55.030
- I ordered something.
- Steak and eggs. Rare and scrambled.

42:55.198 --> 42:57.241
Two steak and eggs, coming up.

43:02.497 --> 43:04.248
Must hurt.

43:04.666 --> 43:08.377
- I wasn't sure you'd remember her.
- I put it together.

43:09.128 --> 43:10.504
Clever.

43:16.594 --> 43:20.806
You know, there's another girl
who works here on the weekends.

43:22.976 --> 43:26.603
- Jen?
- Right. Less letters.

43:27.355 --> 43:29.106
That'd be better.

43:37.156 --> 43:38.991
How's your French coming?

43:39.158 --> 43:42.661
Good. You gonna tell me I ought to be
learning Mandarin?

43:42.829 --> 43:44.621
I never regretted learning French.

43:44.914 --> 43:48.083
I know you have a gun
between your legs.

43:49.669 --> 43:52.212
No? Well, you'll get it eventually.

43:53.298 --> 43:55.215
- Obviously.
- All right, listen.

43:55.383 --> 43:59.052
This is a hard situation, but we both know
how this has to go down.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.555
I can't let you walk away
from this diner.

44:01.723 --> 44:04.641
This is my life now. I earned it.
You had yours already.

44:04.809 --> 44:09.563
So why don't you do what old men do
and die? Get the fuck out of my way.

44:09.731 --> 44:13.108
Why don't you take your gun out
from between your legs and do it?

44:16.070 --> 44:17.154
Boy.

44:22.994 --> 44:25.454
It's hard staring into your eyes.

44:27.540 --> 44:30.375
- It's too strange.
- Your face looks backwards.

44:32.920 --> 44:36.173
So you know what's gonna happen?
You've done all this already?

44:36.341 --> 44:38.884
I don't want to talk about
time travel shit.

44:39.052 --> 44:42.095
If we start talking about it,
we're gonna be here all day.

44:42.263 --> 44:43.930
Making diagrams with straws.

44:44.098 --> 44:47.100
- It doesn't matter.
- I hurt myself, it changes your body.

44:47.268 --> 44:50.270
- Does what I do change your memories?
- It doesn't matter!

45:02.909 --> 45:04.826
My memory is cloudy.

45:05.995 --> 45:07.788
It's a cloud.

45:08.498 --> 45:10.916
Because my memories
aren't really memories.

45:11.084 --> 45:13.835
They're just one possible
eventuality now.

45:15.713 --> 45:21.134
And they grow clearer or cloudier
as they become more or less likely.

45:21.302 --> 45:25.639
But then they get to the present moment,
and they're instantly clear again.

45:26.474 --> 45:29.476
I can remember
what you do after you do it.

45:32.647 --> 45:33.980
And it hurts.

45:34.190 --> 45:36.316
So even when we're apart...

45:36.484 --> 45:38.693
- you can remember what I do after?
- Yes.

45:38.861 --> 45:43.073
But this is a precise description
of a fuzzy mechanism.

45:43.241 --> 45:45.617
It's messy.

45:46.119 --> 45:47.953
All I know... I know two things.

45:48.121 --> 45:52.416
I know what's happening in my head.
And I know that you're gonna meet her.

45:58.297 --> 45:59.464
Who?

46:04.971 --> 46:07.139
She's gonna save your life.

46:12.979 --> 46:15.647
For a long time, she thought we'd...

46:16.649 --> 46:18.817
We'd have a baby.

46:21.779 --> 46:24.030
She'd have been a great mother.

46:26.200 --> 46:29.077
- She wanted it so much.
- Yeah, but she...?

46:30.163 --> 46:31.538
How...?

46:33.166 --> 46:35.000
So she saves my life?

46:35.168 --> 46:36.626
Yes.

46:37.503 --> 46:39.588
Let's take a look at your life.

46:39.755 --> 46:42.424
You're a killer. And a junkie.

46:42.592 --> 46:44.718
A fucking child mentality.

46:44.886 --> 46:48.555
"What's mine." "My life." Save your life.
You're asking me how?

46:48.723 --> 46:51.892
The question is why. Why would
someone sacrifice their life?

46:52.059 --> 46:54.686
Cut your high and mighty bullshit.
I don't need my life...

46:54.854 --> 46:57.355
Shut your fucking child mouth.

46:59.734 --> 47:01.568
You're so self-absorbed and stupid.

47:01.736 --> 47:04.654
And she's gonna clean you up
and she's gonna...

47:12.663 --> 47:17.167
You're gonna take her love
like a sponge.

47:17.335 --> 47:20.587
And you think,
"Maybe I'm clear of the past.

47:20.755 --> 47:22.547
Maybe I'm safe."

47:24.133 --> 47:25.509
Yesterday.

47:26.802 --> 47:28.094
Yesterday what?

47:28.262 --> 47:31.932
Thirty years from now is yesterday.

47:33.392 --> 47:35.560
You're not gonna remember it.

47:46.322 --> 47:48.114
I'm gonna tell you what happens...

47:48.282 --> 47:52.077
to this beautiful woman
who saves your worthless fucking life.

48:36.205 --> 48:38.748
Have you heard of the Rainmaker?

48:40.585 --> 48:43.587
Yeah, Seth said that night.

48:44.255 --> 48:47.382
New boss in the future?
He used the words "holy terror."

48:47.550 --> 48:50.260
Yeah. A reign of terror.

48:50.428 --> 48:54.306
Mass executions. Vagrant purges.
Everywhere at once.

48:54.473 --> 48:57.100
Legend is the Rainmaker
came out of nowhere.

48:57.268 --> 49:01.354
In the span of six months, he took total
control of the five major syndicates.

49:01.522 --> 49:03.898
- That'd take an army.
- He didn't have an army.

49:04.066 --> 49:06.484
The story is that he did it alone.

49:07.069 --> 49:09.195
- Alone alone.
- So how did he do it?

49:09.363 --> 49:13.742
That's the mystery. There's no pictures
of him. Even if it is a him. It's insane.

49:13.909 --> 49:18.413
There are stories he has a synthetic jaw,
saw his mom shot, shit like that.

49:18.581 --> 49:20.957
Word spread through
the ex-looper grapevine...

49:21.125 --> 49:25.086
because the first thing he did
was start closing loops. All of them.

49:29.383 --> 49:31.968
You know what this is? This number?

49:32.136 --> 49:33.345
Dale, wait. Slow down.

49:33.512 --> 49:37.140
It could lead us to the Rainmaker,
Joe! It's in the hospital records.

49:37.308 --> 49:40.477
Write this down: 0, 7, 1, 5, 3...

49:40.645 --> 49:43.313
9, 0, 2, 9, 3, 5!

49:52.073 --> 49:55.992
This is a piece of identifying information
on the Rainmaker.

49:56.160 --> 50:01.498
He's here. He lives here now.
In this county.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.833
And I'm gonna use this to find him.

50:04.001 --> 50:06.086
And I'm gonna kill him.

50:06.253 --> 50:08.463
I'm gonna stop him
from killing my wife.

50:08.631 --> 50:12.592
Fuck you. And your wife.
None of this concerns me.

50:12.760 --> 50:15.053
- This is gonna happen...
- It happened to you.

50:15.221 --> 50:19.432
It doesn't have to happen to me. You
got her picture right there in my watch?

50:19.600 --> 50:22.435
Show me the picture.
As soon as I see her, I walk away.

50:22.603 --> 50:25.480
I'll fucking marry someone else.
Promise.

50:25.648 --> 50:29.150
When I see that picture,
that fog inside your brain should just...

50:29.318 --> 50:32.404
swallow up all the memories,
right? She'll be gone.

50:32.613 --> 50:35.949
- If you give her up, she'll be safe.
- Give her up?

50:36.117 --> 50:40.078
You're the one that got her killed.
If she never meets you, she's safe.

50:40.246 --> 50:42.914
You don't understand.
We don't have to give her up.

50:43.082 --> 50:46.876
I'm not gonna give her up.
I'm gonna save her.

51:01.100 --> 51:04.352
Get to the fields.
We can lose them in the fields.

51:06.021 --> 51:08.690
Hop a train. Get out of town!

51:33.132 --> 51:37.427
What the hell is everybody doing?
You wait for my signal!

51:37.595 --> 51:40.305
- Out back! He's running!
- He ran out the back!

51:50.733 --> 51:52.066
Shit!

51:59.116 --> 52:00.158
Alive!

52:06.707 --> 52:08.541
Fuck! Shit! Come on, come on!

52:08.709 --> 52:11.085
Come on, you piece of shit! Come on!

52:20.763 --> 52:23.431
- Get the tracker! The tracker!
- Go! Go!

52:23.599 --> 52:25.600
Fuck! Fuck!

52:26.936 --> 52:28.520
Shit.

54:11.624 --> 54:14.083
Come on, baby. Time to get up.

54:54.917 --> 54:57.251
Listen up, fucker!

54:57.419 --> 55:03.049
I have shot and buried
three vagrants in the past year!

55:03.467 --> 55:07.178
So I don't care
what hobo sob story you've got.

55:07.346 --> 55:10.807
I get a dozen a week, pal.
It cuts no cash with me.

55:10.975 --> 55:16.229
But if you show your face here again,
I will cut you the fuck in half!

55:57.354 --> 56:01.357
Well, you found him.

56:02.109 --> 56:05.486
Tracking Seth's bike, that was clever.

56:05.654 --> 56:08.781
Then you rustled up a posse
and went out to get him.

56:08.949 --> 56:12.326
- I could do it again.
- You can fuck up again? Really?

56:12.494 --> 56:14.746
I've got too much riding, Kid.

56:14.913 --> 56:18.791
I can't afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.

56:19.752 --> 56:21.544
Put your gat on the table.

56:39.855 --> 56:42.440
I wanted you to say I did good.

56:44.943 --> 56:46.527
That's all I wanted.

56:48.989 --> 56:51.407
This is all I have.

56:58.916 --> 57:00.750
Please give me one more chance?

57:00.918 --> 57:04.128
I'll bring him here alive and hold him.

57:04.963 --> 57:07.715
And you can put a bullet
in his brain yourself.

57:09.134 --> 57:10.426
No!

57:16.809 --> 57:19.894
Get off me! Get off me!

58:09.194 --> 58:10.987
Hey, who's there?

58:15.993 --> 58:19.078
Stop right there! I will shoot you.

58:21.790 --> 58:23.916
You stop! Stop right there!

58:27.171 --> 58:30.423
I'm telling you to stop! You stop!

59:02.039 --> 59:03.581
Head's splitting apart.

59:04.374 --> 59:05.958
- My head.
- Hey.

59:06.126 --> 59:09.128
Look up at the light. Look up at me.

59:09.296 --> 59:10.755
How long since you dropped?

59:10.923 --> 59:12.798
- Dropped?
- Dropped.

59:13.467 --> 59:15.384
- A day.
- A day.

59:15.552 --> 59:16.928
I can't feel my legs.

59:17.095 --> 59:19.805
You're going through withdrawal,
you fucking junkie.

59:19.973 --> 59:22.266
You gotta help me. I'm gonna die.

59:23.477 --> 59:25.311
I'm thirsty.

59:26.104 --> 59:28.439
Water. Water!

59:45.040 --> 59:46.832
Thirsty...

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:01.973
Cid!

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:05.059
Come inside, baby.

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:09.105
- Who is that man?
- He's just a vagrant.

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:11.357
- No, he's not.
- Oh, yeah?

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:13.818
His shoes are too shiny.

01:00:13.986 --> 01:00:15.903
Aren't you a smart monkey.

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:18.447
- Is he sick?
- Yup.

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.033
- Will he get better?
- Yeah.

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:25.246
- Promise?
- Just go to sleep, okay, baby boy?

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:32.211
- Night, sweetie.
- Night, Sara.

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:10.833
Hey!

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:22.261
The first time I saw her face.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:24.055
First time I saw her face.

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:25.973
Look at me.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.850
No.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.102
The first time I saw her face.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:34.982
The first time I saw her face.
The first time I saw your face.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:37.610
The first time I saw her face.

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:22.446
Morning, monkey.
Do you want something to eat?

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:24.657
The man is up.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:27.701
Is he staying here now?

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:29.286
No.

01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:36.794
Toss it.

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:40.548
- I'm about to finish cleaning it.
- Put it down.

01:02:44.136 --> 01:02:46.762
- How are you feeling?
- I'd say I'm at 30 percent.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:49.932
You take it slow,
by the end of the week you'll be at 50.

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:55.104
I took you in so you wouldn't die.
You're not.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:58.107
Take the morning to rest,
then get off my farm.

01:02:58.275 --> 01:03:00.234
- I can't do that.
- I'm sorry?

01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:02.445
I need to stay here for a little while.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.363
- I'm not cool with that.
- Sorry.

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:07.533
You just lost your
"take the morning to rest" privileges.

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:09.160
- Get off my farm.
- No.

01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:11.328
Get off my farm.

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:14.415
You couldn't scare a retarded hobo
with that. Literally.

01:03:14.583 --> 01:03:17.334
This is a Remington 870.
One blast could cut you...

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.879
In half. That's telling.
You're holding a gun.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:22.923
I say I'm not afraid,
so you describe the gun to me.

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:24.967
It's not the gun I'm not afraid of.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.178
What are you gonna do,
shoot in the air?

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:30.181
You wouldn't let me die,
you're not gonna kill me.

01:03:30.348 --> 01:03:31.891
So that makes me weak?

01:03:32.058 --> 01:03:35.561
I'm not a threat to you or your boy.
I need to be on your property.

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:39.231
I'd rather there's no contact at all.
I'm gonna stay in the fields.

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:43.235
There's one thing I need, then you'll
never have to deal with me again.

01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:46.113
Verify this is your house
so I'm in the right place.

01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:48.407
- What's this?
- It's a map.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:50.326
That's my house.
Why is it marked?

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:54.330
Okay, doesn't matter. Look,
I'm gonna be out of the barn in an hour.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:57.208
If you can spare it,
I'm gonna take this canteen.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:04:01.045
- Is there somewhere I can fill it?
- This number, how did you get this?

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.757
That mean something to you?

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:08.969
What? Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:24.527
You're right. I'm not a killer.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:28.405
But I'm fine with how a blast of rock salt
to your face won't kill you.

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:31.283
Now you're gonna tell me
who you are...

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:34.620
and what the fuck
you're doing on my farm.

01:04:34.788 --> 01:04:36.288
Okay.

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.168
Time travel hasn't been invented yet...

01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:45.714
but in 30 years, it will have been.
It's gonna be used by these criminal...

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:47.550
You're a looper?

01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:02.815
I can't go back to the city
because Abe, the boss...

01:05:02.983 --> 01:05:07.403
his men will be searching for me 24/7
until they find me. Or find him.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:08.904
All I've got is that map.

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:12.783
He had three houses marked on it,
yours is one of them.

01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:15.035
I know he's coming here.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:18.789
You know about loopers?
You know what we do?

01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:22.626
So he's coming here
to murder my son...

01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:25.671
because he thinks he might be
this Rainmaker?

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:29.300
Once he kills the Rainmaker,
what happens?

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:32.386
I think he thinks if he killed
the Rainmaker...

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:34.555
he never would have been sent back.

01:05:34.723 --> 01:05:37.850
He'd just vanish.
He'd disappear just like he appeared.

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:41.729
He'd be back with his wife.

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:46.108
Who is he, this guy you let run?

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:48.193
Just some random guy
from the future?

01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:51.739
He's just somebody.
You know what the numbers mean?

01:05:55.243 --> 01:06:00.331
This is Cid's birthday and this is the med
code of the hospital he was born in.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:10.132
How many kids were born in
that hospital that day with your son?

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.051
- Like, two?
- Sounds right.

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:15.512
Three kids, three houses
marked on his map.

01:06:15.764 --> 01:06:17.264
One of them is the Rainmaker.

01:06:17.432 --> 01:06:20.142
- He doesn't know which.
- What's he gonna do?

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:23.479
Oh, God.

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:15.424
- Can he really do this?
- Think about what doing this would fix.

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:18.385
What he thinks it would fix.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:25.809
If he comes here, will you stop him?

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:31.231
- I'm asking, can I trust you?
- I don't care if you trust me.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:33.399
I don't care about your son.

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:36.862
I lost my life. I kill
this man, I get it back.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:45.703
He'll kill the other two kids
and come here last. Put off facing me.

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:49.332
All this goddamn cane leaves us blind.

01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:53.127
He can get within 50 yards of this place
without a hawk spotting him.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:56.131
What makes sense
is we burn the fields. Level them.

01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:59.384
How much gas you got in that barn?

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:03.680
- No, you can't burn down my cane fields.
- This stuff is half dead anyway.

01:09:03.848 --> 01:09:09.310
It's the seed for next year.
It's not gonna happen, you fucking nut.

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:17.444
Listen, use what you need
and set up anywhere.

01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:20.197
But one thing:
I don't want you talking to Cid.

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:22.282
I watch my son, you watch the cane.

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:24.033
- That's the deal.
- Good by me.

01:09:24.202 --> 01:09:25.618
Fine.

01:09:25.787 --> 01:09:28.205
- Jesus.
- All right, hold still.

01:09:29.957 --> 01:09:33.167
It's easy for things to get infected
on a farm.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:34.962
Start falling off.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.006
Pussy.

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:45.389
I'm out here and you're in the house.
We need a way to communicate.

01:09:45.557 --> 01:09:49.518
There's a dinner bell in the barn.
You can ring that if someone's coming.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:53.479
Dinner bell. We need buzzers
or walkies or something.

01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:57.943
I don't know what we've got,
but I'll look. Cid!

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.865
- How's the math coming?
- I want to help the man.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.868
- Help him with what?
- I could help him with my toys.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:07.870
No. Let me talk to you.

01:10:08.788 --> 01:10:11.331
I need you to stay away
from that man. Okay?

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:13.625
Let him do his thing, but stick with me.

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:16.044
- Okay?
- Is he not good?

01:10:16.588 --> 01:10:19.131
Well, we're gonna see what he is.
All right?

01:10:19.299 --> 01:10:21.508
But I need you to stick with me.

01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:23.260
Good boy.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.852
Hand me that Phillips.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:21.234
- Tell me if you hear her coming.
- What are we doing here?

01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:23.403
Commundication.

01:11:26.074 --> 01:11:28.700
But I need to make it stronger.

01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:31.036
- And how do we do that?
- Bigger battery.

01:11:31.663 --> 01:11:33.246
Smart.

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.168
Do you kill people?

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:45.425
Let's say I kill people.

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:47.761
With your gun?

01:11:51.516 --> 01:11:53.600
- You want a gun like mine?
- Yeah.

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:57.896
What are you gonna do with it,
pole vaulting? It's bigger than you.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:01.817
Stop bad things from happening.

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.362
Shit!

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:23.839
So how long you and your mom
been out here on the farm?

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:25.757
She's not.

01:12:26.426 --> 01:12:28.135
She's not what?

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:33.974
Sara doesn't know,
but I remember my real mom.

01:12:35.727 --> 01:12:39.980
When I was a baby, I couldn't stop it.

01:12:40.148 --> 01:12:42.065
Couldn't stop what?

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:46.445
I couldn't stop her from getting killed.

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:50.198
I saw it, but I couldn't stop it.

01:12:50.616 --> 01:12:53.243
I wasn't strong enough.

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.748
You should...

01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:03.879
- You should talk to your mom about this.
- She's not my mom. She's a liar.

01:13:17.769 --> 01:13:22.022
Spotted him coming out of a sewer tunnel
on the west end. He's on the run.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.828
Think he's heading to the west
on Talbott Street...

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:40.040
possibly to Whore's Alley.
We have a visual.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:45.921
You can't take that thing out
with a plow or something?

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:52.260
Listen, I found a...

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:56.932
In the barn, I found some parts
and I made a thing.

01:13:58.559 --> 01:13:59.976
Here.

01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:04.106
So if you see something, just push that.

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:07.484
When?

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:13.031
Last night he woke me up.
Don't tell him I told you. He didn't...

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.996
You said you were his mom.

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:22.958
Yeah.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.502
He told me you're not.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:28.713
He said that?

01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:31.716
Yeah.

01:14:32.593 --> 01:14:36.012
- If he's not your son, who is he?
- He's my son.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:40.559
I had Cid when I was 22.

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:43.603
But I didn't want to give up my life
in the city.

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:47.566
So I dropped him here on the farm
with my sister...

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:51.486
and she saw how I was living,
so she took him.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:54.906
And my sister, she raised him.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:00.996
She loved him. He called her Mom.

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:08.879
How did she get killed?

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.505
Jesus Christ.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:12.841
He remembers it.
You've gotta talk to him.

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:16.469
I told you one thing.
I told you to stay away from my son.

01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:19.014
- He asked about my gun.
- Stay out of it!

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.516
And stay the fuck away from my son!

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:28.648
Where does 56 go?

01:15:29.609 --> 01:15:32.277
Oh, good. You're smart.

01:15:32.612 --> 01:15:33.653
Twenty-one?

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:35.989
How long can you not sleep?

01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:39.951
I don't know. Probably a while.
It's a good question.

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:42.245
Where does it go? Come on.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:45.832
Good.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.417
Thirty-two?

01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:50.587
- You should help Joe watch.
- Joe?

01:15:50.755 --> 01:15:53.006
Because he can't stay awake
all the time.

01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:55.800
- Isn't our business. Okay?
- He's keeping us safe.

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:57.636
Let's do this now, okay?

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:00.597
You have 32 there.
I know you know this one.

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:07.062
- No. Eight times three is what?
- Thirty-two.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:09.272
Eight times three is what?

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:10.857
Thirty-two.

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:19.366
- I want you to count three eights.
- Eight, sixteen...

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:22.035
thirty-two.

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:24.412
- You telling me you want alone time?
- No.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.374
Then why don't you put that
where it belongs?

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.173
- Alone time.
- He's protecting us...

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:37.133
because you can't do it.

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:40.845
- I told you to stay away from him, didn't I?
- I never did anything.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:42.889
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- So?

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.517
- I told Joe to leave...
- So?!

01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:48.520
- You do what I tell you!
- You can't tell me what to do.

01:16:48.688 --> 01:16:50.105
You're not my mom!

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:52.274
You're not my mom! You're a liar!

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:55.193
You're gonna get killed
because you won't stop lying!

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.737
- Cid, calm down.
- You're lying! I hate you!

01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:00.031
- You're lying to me! I hate you!
- Cid...

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:03.493
- I hate you! Liar! You're lying!
- Calm down. Calm down.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:20.135
Liar!

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:28.518
You're not my mom! You're a liar!

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.525
You're not my mom!

01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:36.901
I hate you!

01:17:37.069 --> 01:17:38.570
Liar!

01:17:38.738 --> 01:17:41.239
Liar! Liar!

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.483
I'm sorry.

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:21.404
It's okay, sweetie.

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:09.828
Holy shit.

01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:04.299
Evening, ma'am.

01:20:05.509 --> 01:20:08.178
Evening. How can I help you?

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:13.224
You can start by accepting
my apologies re the hour.

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:15.935
- Hope I didn't catch you at supper.
- That's fine.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:18.646
I've been walking
between empty farms all day.

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:21.149
Thought I'd just
tick this one off the list.

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:24.068
- Not have to come back tomorrow.
- What's this about?

01:20:24.904 --> 01:20:26.821
You alone here, ma'am?

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:28.865
My husband should be back any time.

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:30.700
Happy to hear it.

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:36.289
Could I trouble you for some water?

01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:39.751
I'll get you some.
You can take the glass with you.

01:20:39.919 --> 01:20:41.711
Actually, ma'am...

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:45.673
my business today,
this ticking off the list business...

01:20:49.637 --> 01:20:52.472
- Will you tell me what this is about?
- I will, yes.

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.435
Can I come in?

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:02.398
Ma'am?

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:14.327
I'm a deputized police officer,
looking for an escaped criminal.

01:21:15.329 --> 01:21:18.373
Anyone through here
in the past two days, vagrants?

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:21.209
Vagrants are always passing,
nobody near the house.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:22.418
That man there?

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:25.547
He's young. No.

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:29.509
We're looking for his father, too.
Similar looking build, late 50s...

01:21:29.677 --> 01:21:32.178
may or may not be traveling together.

01:21:34.181 --> 01:21:35.890
Do you recognize them?

01:21:37.268 --> 01:21:39.936
- No.
- Keep them.

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.815
Your kids with your husband?

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:47.110
Yeah, just one.

01:21:47.278 --> 01:21:49.696
- How old?
- Ten.

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:51.406
Ten...

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:13.761
I'm gonna show you
the barn and house.

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:15.847
And then you can be on your way.

01:22:16.015 --> 01:22:19.601
I took the liberty with your barn.
Apologies.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.563
So the house.

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:41.372
- Ten, you said? Your boy?
- Yeah.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.041
And your husband?

01:22:44.335 --> 01:22:47.545
I've just gotta check in
with the home office.

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:52.592
The boy's in the city with his father.
When they getting back?

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.344
Couldn't tell you.

01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:02.101
This goddamn thing.

01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:05.897
I can never get a signal
this far out of town.

01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:10.026
Piece of shit.

01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:17.909
Okay. Here we go.

01:23:18.869 --> 01:23:20.078
Is this man dangerous?

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:24.499
He shoots men down for a living.
He's a stone-cold killer.

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:27.794
My boss has half the city
looking for him.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:30.380
Half the city and me, so...

01:23:30.589 --> 01:23:33.049
And if you find him,
there's a hell of a price.

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:36.761
Chunk of money like that,
you should think on it.

01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:41.391
- I will.
- All right. Show me upstairs.

01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:45.228
There's drafts in the house.

01:24:04.998 --> 01:24:08.584
My granddad built this tunnel
when the vagrant raids got bad.

01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:12.213
- Nana said he was nuts.
- Thank you, Granddad.

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:16.759
- That wasn't the man.
- No. It's funny. I know that guy, though.

01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:21.514
His name is Jesse.
I like him. He's good.

01:24:21.932 --> 01:24:24.475
He's gonna go away
once he doesn't find me.

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.644
He won't hurt your mom.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.981
- Sara.
- Where's your mom?

01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:33.443
Where's my mom?

01:24:36.321 --> 01:24:40.867
She gave me up.
I was younger than you.

01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:45.747
We were vagrants,
and she was alone.

01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:50.543
I thought she was stupid
for getting on the drugs she was on...

01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:54.213
but now I see she was just so alone.

01:24:55.132 --> 01:24:56.966
It's what she had.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:00.762
She sold me to a panhandle gang.

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:05.099
I got away and I ran
and ended up on this train.

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:07.810
I remember I was sitting there
in an empty car.

01:25:08.479 --> 01:25:10.480
And I saw myself
over and over again...

01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:15.401
killing those men that bought me,
that got my mom on what she was on.

01:25:15.569 --> 01:25:19.530
Just finding them and tearing them apart.
Saving my mom.

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:20.948
But you didn't.

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:24.994
No, a man in the city found me,
put a gun in my hand.

01:25:25.162 --> 01:25:26.954
Gave me something that was mine.

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:31.292
That's just men trying to figure out
what they would do...

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.795
to keep what's theirs,
what they've got.

01:25:34.463 --> 01:25:36.881
That's the only kind of man there is.

01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:40.092
I'm not gonna let Sara get killed.

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:53.356
I think we're clear.

01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:06.536
Sara!

01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:11.499
Baby.

01:26:29.226 --> 01:26:31.561
All working girls, yeah?

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:35.690
This whole block
and a couple of blocks over.

01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:38.317
Hello, Joe.

01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:41.362
If you want to check those,
too, I can arrange.

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:47.827
I'm an arranger, stranger.

01:26:47.995 --> 01:26:50.746
If you don't see
what you want to see, no refunds.

01:27:55.228 --> 01:27:56.520
What?

01:27:58.774 --> 01:28:00.316
What happened?

01:28:46.697 --> 01:28:49.031
That's pretty good.

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:54.161
In the city, young guys would...

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:58.624
hit on me
by floating fucking quarters.

01:28:58.792 --> 01:29:02.044
And I wouldn't tell them I was TK...

01:29:02.212 --> 01:29:04.964
but I would keep their quarters down.

01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:10.720
This one guy just busted a blood vessel
in his eye trying to get it up.

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.401
He's you.

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:27.737
Your loop.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:31.073
You lied to me.

01:29:32.743 --> 01:29:36.579
But I know you're not lying
when you say you're gonna kill this guy...

01:29:36.747 --> 01:29:38.789
your own self.

01:29:38.999 --> 01:29:42.043
You protected Cid from that gat man.

01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:47.548
- Yeah.
- He saved your ass, didn't he?

01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:49.467
He saved my ass.

01:29:49.926 --> 01:29:51.594
He's a...

01:29:54.598 --> 01:29:56.265
He's a good kid.

01:29:56.433 --> 01:29:58.350
Yeah, he is.

01:30:01.104 --> 01:30:05.316
You know, when I came back,
after my sister died...

01:30:06.276 --> 01:30:08.986
I remember seeing him...

01:30:09.863 --> 01:30:14.200
for the first time in two years
just sitting on the porch.

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:19.455
I drove up crying. I'd been at this...

01:30:19.623 --> 01:30:23.959
party all night in the city
when I got the call...

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:31.300
so I was wearing
this ridiculous party dress.

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:36.222
All my ridiculous shit.

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:40.518
And I don't know if he...

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.313
even remembered me...

01:30:45.524 --> 01:30:47.942
but he looked at me...

01:30:54.116 --> 01:30:56.700
I abandoned him.

01:30:59.955 --> 01:31:02.665
I abandoned my baby.

01:31:07.337 --> 01:31:10.965
And I've seen so many men
in the city...

01:31:11.633 --> 01:31:15.719
who I look in their eyes
and they're just lost.

01:31:17.764 --> 01:31:20.349
So whether he loves me back or not...

01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:25.729
as long as I'm there to raise him...

01:31:26.857 --> 01:31:29.692
he's gonna be taken care of.

01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:33.529
He's gonna be safe.

01:31:35.323 --> 01:31:38.325
He's never gonna get lost.

01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:02.141
Hello, Joe.

01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:04.894
Jesse.

01:32:06.062 --> 01:32:09.732
Put this down and let her go.

01:32:10.734 --> 01:32:14.320
Sara, Jesse here is the best shot
with a gat that I know.

01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:18.866
When he lets you go, just sit on
the couch. Don't do anything stupid.

01:32:24.664 --> 01:32:27.583
He's coming here, Jess.
My loop is coming here.

01:32:27.751 --> 01:32:31.629
- I gotta take you in.
- I got 948 bars of pure silver.

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:33.797
I close my loop, I get right with Abe.

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:36.425
Whatever he gives back,
I'll split it with you.

01:32:36.593 --> 01:32:38.135
Was that your plan?

01:32:39.262 --> 01:32:40.387
Okay, take all of it.

01:32:40.555 --> 01:32:43.224
Are you delusional?
You ain't getting right.

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:47.937
Long as Abe's got one gat man standing
he's gonna hunt you until his dying day.

01:32:48.605 --> 01:32:52.191
We're gonna go now. Gonna get
in my truck and you're just gonna...

01:33:07.123 --> 01:33:08.832
I'm sorry.

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:12.771
The Rainmaker...

01:34:36.296 --> 01:34:39.757
Cid!

01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:42.384
Oh, my God!

01:34:45.263 --> 01:34:47.264
Cid!

01:34:49.225 --> 01:34:50.809
Cid?

01:34:51.519 --> 01:34:55.105
It's him. What is he, some TK freak?

01:34:55.899 --> 01:34:57.441
You knew.

01:34:59.986 --> 01:35:02.363
- What are you doing?
- How did your sister die?

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:06.033
- What are you doing with those guns?
- Is that what happened to her?

01:35:06.201 --> 01:35:07.743
- No!
- He kill her like that?

01:35:07.911 --> 01:35:11.288
No. He was climbing a bookshelf
and it fell back on him.

01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:13.916
He can get scared. It exploded.

01:35:14.084 --> 01:35:16.460
- Jesus frigging...
- He'll learn to control it.

01:35:16.628 --> 01:35:20.506
- Imagine what he's gonna do!
- If he did good with it, though.

01:35:20.673 --> 01:35:23.550
If he grew up with me raising him.

01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:25.719
If he grew up good...

01:35:27.389 --> 01:35:28.389
He doesn't.

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:31.517
You stay away from him, Joe!

01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:40.317
Cid! Stay away from Joe, baby!

01:35:40.819 --> 01:35:42.778
Follow me, baby!

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:44.756
Come to me. It's okay.

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.138
It's okay, baby.

01:36:53.850 --> 01:36:55.684
Right now two things have happened.

01:36:55.852 --> 01:36:58.187
My loop knows Cid's the kid
he's looking for.

01:36:58.354 --> 01:37:00.105
And my gang knows I'm here.

01:37:00.273 --> 01:37:04.151
That means in 15 minutes, one or both
of them is coming down that highway.

01:37:04.736 --> 01:37:07.446
Pack up the truck.
Take everything you can and go.

01:37:07.614 --> 01:37:10.115
Drive north away from the city.

01:37:10.783 --> 01:37:12.159
Thank you.

01:37:25.215 --> 01:37:27.216
Got everyone here, all our men.

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:29.593
Arm them up. Let's go.

01:37:38.228 --> 01:37:39.895
I got him, Abe. I got him.

01:37:41.105 --> 01:37:43.607
Well, shit.

01:37:46.069 --> 01:37:47.903
That's right, motherfuckers.

01:37:49.113 --> 01:37:50.531
I got him.

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:52.658
Knew he was sweet
on this one whore.

01:37:52.825 --> 01:37:55.118
- I checked her building...
- They found Joe...

01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:58.914
in a farm on the east side.
That's why all the gat men are here.

01:37:59.082 --> 01:38:02.042
The whole crew is arming up
to make a sweep.

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:03.544
Joe?

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:06.755
Fuck Joe. Save your bullets!
I've got the loop!

01:38:07.382 --> 01:38:11.051
Not such a fuck-up now?
I'm bringing him up to see Abe.

01:38:21.396 --> 01:38:22.604
Get this asshole!

01:38:25.358 --> 01:38:26.942
Motherfuckers!

01:39:38.806 --> 01:39:40.682
Holy shit.

01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:49.441
Joe!

01:39:51.235 --> 01:39:54.529
Guess I put the gun
in that kid's hand?

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.118
I guess everything
comes back around.

01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:04.081
Like your goddamn ties.

01:41:28.374 --> 01:41:31.793
Take this truck. And take your gold
and go live your life.

01:41:31.961 --> 01:41:35.672
Nobody's coming after you. I fixed it.

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:38.091
You go kill the boy.
That how you fix it?

01:41:38.259 --> 01:41:40.844
You're goddamn right
I'm gonna kill that boy!

01:41:41.012 --> 01:41:44.055
- You just got your life back.
- My life?

01:41:44.223 --> 01:41:47.017
Your life. Becoming you.

01:41:47.185 --> 01:41:50.020
Goddamn it!
You've lost your fucking mind!

01:41:50.188 --> 01:41:54.024
You let this boy live,
he's going to take everything you've got.

01:41:54.192 --> 01:41:56.067
And everything I got!

01:41:57.069 --> 01:42:00.113
- See what he becomes.
- I haven't seen that yet.

01:42:00.281 --> 01:42:01.782
Goddamn it!

01:42:53.543 --> 01:42:54.584
Shit.

01:42:54.752 --> 01:42:57.212
Okay, baby, we're going.

01:42:58.923 --> 01:43:00.507
Put your seat belt on.

01:43:27.201 --> 01:43:28.910
- Stop.
- Duck down. It's okay.

01:43:29.078 --> 01:43:31.705
- Stop, please. He can shoot us.
- Duck down.

01:43:31.873 --> 01:43:35.250
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:59.482
- Cid.
- I'm sorry.

01:43:59.650 --> 01:44:03.236
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna get you down.

01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:15.373
Okay, we're going into the cane.
Go. Go.

01:44:21.756 --> 01:44:23.214
Go.

01:44:41.275 --> 01:44:42.525
No!

01:44:50.576 --> 01:44:53.370
No. Cid, no.

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:43.336
No!

01:45:48.592 --> 01:45:52.846
It's okay, baby. You're okay.

01:45:54.765 --> 01:45:56.891
It's okay, baby.

01:46:00.688 --> 01:46:02.772
It's okay.

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:05.900
I love you. Calm down.

01:46:06.569 --> 01:46:08.611
Good boy.

01:46:10.614 --> 01:46:18.079
Mommy loves you.

01:46:19.373 --> 01:46:21.166
It's okay.

01:46:23.586 --> 01:46:25.420
Mom.

01:46:35.181 --> 01:46:36.598
Shit.

01:46:40.019 --> 01:46:43.772
You did good. You did so good.
Good boy.

01:46:46.817 --> 01:46:49.903
Listen to me. I need you to run
into the fields now.

01:46:50.071 --> 01:46:53.740
- No, Mom, I don't want to leave you.
- It's okay.

01:46:53.908 --> 01:46:56.159
- You need to go. Go!
- Move!

01:46:56.327 --> 01:46:58.203
Move, goddamn it!

01:47:15.137 --> 01:47:16.304
Move.

01:47:21.185 --> 01:47:22.685
Then I saw it.

01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:30.443
I saw a mom
who would die for her son.

01:47:32.613 --> 01:47:34.864
A man who would kill for his wife.

01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:40.203
A boy, angry and alone.

01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:44.207
Laid out in front of him,
the bad path. I saw it.

01:47:46.627 --> 01:47:48.169
And the path was a circle...

01:47:51.882 --> 01:47:53.758
round and round.

01:48:04.937 --> 01:48:06.229
So I changed it.

01:48:22.204 --> 01:48:23.788
Cid!

01:48:47.146 --> 01:48:48.646
Where's Joe?

01:48:50.482 --> 01:48:53.109
He had to go away, baby.

01:48:54.305 --> 01:49:00.199
