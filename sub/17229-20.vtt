00:06.340 --> 00:08.509
MMM,
SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.510
THANKS!

00:09.510 --> 00:11.011
<i>iAY!</i>

00:11.011 --> 00:14.281
ALBERTO,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

00:14.281 --> 00:17.351
I'M MAKING MY <i>HUEVOS CON QUESO</i>
WITH EXTRA BALONEY.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.686
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT JUST HEALTHY.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.455
IT'S DELICIOUS!

00:21.455 --> 00:25.158
NO, WHY ARE YOU IN OUR HOUSE
THIS EARLY IN THE MORNING?

00:25.158 --> 00:26.326
I'VE SEEN YOU HERE
IN THE AFTERNOONS,

00:26.326 --> 00:27.761
AND I DIDN'T LOVE IT.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.029
FELIX DIDN'T TELL YOU?

00:29.029 --> 00:31.131
MORNING...
MOST OF YOU.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.401
NO.
FELIX DIDN'T TELL ME.

00:34.401 --> 00:37.137
A-ALBERTO, I WASN'T
EXPECTING TO SEE YOU HERE.

00:37.137 --> 00:38.672
AH, DIDN'T TELL HER,
HUH?

00:38.672 --> 00:40.073
TELL ME WHAT?!

00:40.073 --> 00:41.275
ALBERTO
NEEDS A PLACE TO STAY

00:41.275 --> 00:42.476
WHILE HIS ROOMMATE'S
GIRLFRIEND'S IN TOWN --

00:42.476 --> 00:44.244
A FEW DAYS AT THE MOST.

00:44.244 --> 00:47.414
COULD BE A WEEK.
YEAH, WE'RE NOT PUTTING
A NUMBER ON IT.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.116
AND WHEN EXACTLY
WERE YOU

00:49.116 --> 00:51.752
PLANNING ON ASKING ME,
<i>MI AMOR?</i>

00:51.752 --> 00:55.122
I WAS KIND OF HOPING
YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE HIM.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.692
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
GETTING REALLY AWKWARD.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.627
I'M JUST GONNA EAT THIS
OUT ON THE LAWN.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.265
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS,
FELIX.
[DOOR CLOSES]

01:05.265 --> 01:07.034
OH, SO YOUR MOM AND CRISTELA
GET TO STAY

01:07.034 --> 01:08.602
AS LONG AS THEY WANT,
BUT MY COUSIN HAS TO GO?

01:08.602 --> 01:11.071
CRISTELA IS JUST STAYING
TILL SHE PASSES THE BAR.

01:11.071 --> 01:15.676
AND <i>AMA</i> IS JUST
STAYING UNTIL SHE...PASSES.

01:15.676 --> 01:19.012
COME ON, <i>MI AMOR.</i>
IT'S ONLY A FEW DAYS.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.047
A WEEK.

01:20.047 --> 01:21.181
WE'RE NOT PUTTING
A NUMBER ON IT.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.084
MORNING.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.652
BESIDES,
I TOLD HIM YES.

01:25.652 --> 01:26.687
[SIGHS] FINE.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.522
BUT FULLY DRESSED
OUT OF THE BATHROOM.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.723
NO ROBES.

01:29.723 --> 01:33.093
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
WHAT I SAW ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.596
WHY IS ALBERTO

01:35.596 --> 01:38.131
STANDING OUT ON THE LAWN,
EATING OUT OF A SKILLET?

01:39.533 --> 01:41.335
HEY, CAN I GET
SOME HOT SAUCE?

01:43.537 --> 01:44.571
THANKS.

01:44.571 --> 01:45.672
IS THAT
<i>HUEVOS CON QUESO?</i>

01:45.672 --> 01:47.140
YEAH,
WITH EXTRA BALONEY.

01:47.140 --> 01:49.142
OH, HOLD ON.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

01:58.986 --> 02:02.389
ONE MEDIUM
DARK ROAST.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.391
HEY, MR. CULPEPER'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN CALL ME THAT.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.492
[LAUGHS]

02:07.995 --> 02:09.329
AND NOW
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE.

02:09.329 --> 02:10.764
[CHUCKLES] SORRY.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.766
THANKS FOR THE COFFEE.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.067
YEAH, I DID --
YOU HELPED ME OUT

02:14.067 --> 02:16.136
WITH THAT
GUN-RANGE EXPANSION.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.971
BUT WE DIDN'T GET
THE PERMIT OUR CLIENTS NEEDED.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.439
EXACTLY. WE FAILED.

02:19.439 --> 02:21.642
SO THE ENVIRONMENT
LIVES ANOTHER DAY.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.643
[CHUCKLES]

02:22.643 --> 02:24.244
TO FAILURE.

02:24.244 --> 02:25.245
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

02:25.245 --> 02:28.248
[MADDIE GIGGLES]

02:28.248 --> 02:31.418
[Whining] I WANT ONE.

02:31.418 --> 02:34.087
GET YOUR OWN COFFEE,
MADDIE.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.990
NO, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT YOUR MAN.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.026
HE'S NOT MY MAN.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.063
HE'S JUST A MAN, YOU KNOW --
WELL, NOT JUST A MAN.

02:43.063 --> 02:45.232
I'M SURE HE'S MORE THAN THAT,
NOT THAT I WOULD KNOW.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.300
IT DOESN'T EVEN REALLY MATTER,
'CAUSE WE WORK TOGETHER.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.539
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?

02:52.539 --> 02:53.707
OH, JUST, UM,
DATING COWORKERS.

02:53.707 --> 02:54.741
OH, YEAH.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.576
I MEAN,
IT MAKES SENSE, YOU KNOW.

02:56.576 --> 02:58.412
THEY'RE THE PEOPLE
YOU SEE THE MOST.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.113
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE
SIMILAR INTERESTS.

03:00.113 --> 03:02.449
AND YOU'VE WATCHED THEM EAT IN
THE UGLIEST LIGHTING POSSIBLE.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.553
OH, AND WHEN YOU GET IN A FIGHT,
YOU CAN HAVE YOUR DAD FIRE THEM.

03:06.553 --> 03:07.654
[CHUCKLES]

03:10.991 --> 03:14.294
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS
FOR EVERYBODY.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.129
BESIDES, I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT DATING,

03:16.129 --> 03:18.165
BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST GET
IN THE WAY OF MY CAREER.

03:18.165 --> 03:19.466
HMM, THAT'S SMART.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.601
YOU CAN DATE AFTER YOU'VE
REACHED ALL YOUR GOALS.

03:21.601 --> 03:24.137
LIKE
RUTH BADER GINSBURG.

03:24.137 --> 03:26.139
COME ON, CRISTELA.

03:26.139 --> 03:29.009
YOU CAN WATCH ME DELIVER THE BAD
NEWS TO THE GUN-RANGE CLIENTS.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.144
OH, BREAKING BAD NEWS
TO MEN WITH GUNS?

03:31.144 --> 03:33.480
I'LL BE
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.149
DIRECTLY BEHIND YOU.
GOOD.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.151
IT'LL BE
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE,

03:38.151 --> 03:40.053
AND I GET TO USE
THE CARPOOL LANE.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.122
AH! SHOTGUN!
[CHUCKLES]

03:42.122 --> 03:44.124
SURE.
WE'LL GET YOU ONE.

03:52.499 --> 03:53.734
[CHUCKLES]

03:53.734 --> 03:57.704
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE PLACE, CRISTELA?

03:57.704 --> 04:03.410
I LIKE MY STORES TO HAVE
A HIGHER SNACK-TO-GUN RATIO.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.113
MM, COWBOY HATS
AND SIX-SHOOTERS --

04:06.113 --> 04:09.049
IT'S KIND OF
A YOSEMITE SAM'S CLUB.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.250
[CHUCKLES]

04:10.250 --> 04:12.419
OH, THERE THEY ARE,
THE MEN WHO MADE IT RAIN.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.254
WELCOME BACK TO TEXAS,
GENTLEMEN.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.256
GOOD-LOOKING. ED.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.591
YEAH.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.259
IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.427
I SEE YOU HAVEN'T MISSED
A BURRITO, YEAH?

04:20.427 --> 04:21.461
[CHUCKLES]

04:21.461 --> 04:23.196

GOT TO LOVE TEXAS.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.531
THE THREE R's
OF EDUCATION --

04:24.531 --> 04:26.366
READING, 'RITING,
AND REMINGTON.

04:26.366 --> 04:27.501
[ALL CHUCKLING]

04:27.501 --> 04:30.036
YOU REMEMBER MY ASSOCIATE,
CRISTELA HERNANDEZ.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.972
HI.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
USED TO HAVE

04:31.972 --> 04:35.208
THAT BLOND INTERN THAT WAS LIKE
TALKING TO A PIECE OF WOOD.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.710
[CHUCKLES]
REMEMBER HER?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.378
YEAH. THAT'S HIS DAUGHTER.
OH-HO.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.247
LET ME FINISH!

04:40.247 --> 04:41.481
[LAUGHTER]

04:41.481 --> 04:45.118
SO, YEAH. SO HOW IS THAT
GUN-RANGE EXPANSION LOOKING?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.753
YOU KNOW THAT I EXPLAINED
TO THE COMMITTEE

04:46.753 --> 04:49.422
THAT YOUR EXPANSION WOULD
CONTRIBUTE TO,

04:49.422 --> 04:52.993
ENHANCE, AND PROMOTE THE
GENERAL WELFARE IN THE AREA...

04:52.993 --> 04:54.294
YEAH.
...PLUS WE WOULD COMPLY

04:54.294 --> 04:57.631
WITH ALL ZONING REGULATIONS
AND STANDARDS.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.100
THEY DIDN'T BUY IT.
WE COULDN'T GET THE PERMIT.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.035
YEAH, IT'S JUST THAT

05:02.035 --> 05:04.504
NADINE WILFORK CHAIRS
THE PLANNING COMMISSION,

05:04.504 --> 05:08.308
AND, UH, WELL, SHE'S
KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL CRAZY.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.477
AND BY CRAZY,
YOU MEAN SOMEONE

05:10.477 --> 05:13.380
WHO LIKES THE PLANET
WE LIVE ON?

05:13.380 --> 05:16.082
BONA FIDE NUTJOB.
YOU BETCHA.

05:16.082 --> 05:17.050
SHE LETS
HER PERSONAL POLITICS

05:17.050 --> 05:19.019
GET IN THE WAY OF PROGRESS
EVERY TIME.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.187
MAKES NO SENSE --
I MEAN,

05:20.187 --> 05:21.655
THERE'S NO ZONING REGULATIONS
IN HOUSTON.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.690
YOU CAN HAVE A REFINERY
RIGHT NEXT TO A PRESCHOOL.

05:23.690 --> 05:27.027
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
YES.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.061
WELL, THIS IS DALLAS.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.529
WE STILL HAVE A FEW
STRAY LIBERALS

05:29.529 --> 05:30.697
GUMMING UP THE WORKS.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.532
BUT THANK GOD,
IT'S NOT AUSTIN.

05:32.532 --> 05:36.169
WITH THEIR MISGUIDED LOVE
OF NATURE...AND PRESCHOOLERS!

05:36.169 --> 05:38.171
UGH, AUSTIN!

05:38.171 --> 05:41.174
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HUNTERS
ARE GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

05:43.143 --> 05:46.146
I THINK THIS GUY
WOULD DISAGREE.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.648
NOT A BIG GUN FAN,
HUH?

05:48.648 --> 05:50.450
MM, NOT HUGE, NO.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.319
HAVE YOU EVER
DISCHARGED A FIREARM?

05:52.319 --> 05:56.389
DOES "CALL OF DUTY"
COUNT?

05:56.389 --> 05:58.391
[CHUCKLES] DON'T KNOCK IT
TILL YOU'VE TRIED IT.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.126
COME WITH ME
FOR A MINUTE.

06:00.126 --> 06:02.162
COULD YOU PUNCH THIS OPEN
FOR US?

06:02.162 --> 06:04.130
[BEEPING]
JUST TAKE A LOOK.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.132
[GUNSHOTS]

06:08.068 --> 06:10.070
WOW!

06:10.070 --> 06:11.571
AH, HA!

06:11.571 --> 06:13.573
IT WASN'T THAT BAD!
[LAUGHS]

06:13.573 --> 06:16.076
UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD
EXPAND THAT RANGE!

06:16.076 --> 06:19.079
[LAUGHS]

06:19.079 --> 06:21.014
YEAH.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.584
CAN'T BE WRONG
IF IT FEELS THIS RIGHT.

06:24.584 --> 06:26.119
[CHUCKLES]

06:30.390 --> 06:33.393
ANOTHER LATE NIGHT
RESEARCHING ZONING ORDINANCES.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.763
WHO SAID LAW ISN'T FUN?

06:36.763 --> 06:38.598
AT LEAST THE PEOPLE
WHO BOUGHT MY TICKETS

06:38.598 --> 06:42.102
TO THE MAVERICKS GAME
ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

06:42.102 --> 06:45.205
NOT REALLY.
THEY'RE DOWN BY 15.

06:45.205 --> 06:48.975
UNLESS YOU'RE TAPING IT.
THEN IT'S A TIE GAME.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.045
I HOPE YOU DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

06:52.045 --> 06:54.447
BUT IT'S KIND OF FUN
DESTROYING THE EARTH WITH YOU.

06:54.447 --> 06:55.982
[CHUCKLES]

06:55.982 --> 06:57.517
THE PROBLEM IS,
WHEN YOU'RE DONE,

06:57.517 --> 06:59.119
THERE'S NOWHERE
TO CELEBRATE.

07:03.723 --> 07:08.094
I THINK I FOUND A WAY TO GET
THE JOB DONE AND STILL BE GREEN.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.230
LAY IT ON ME.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.066
WELL, UH, THE ZONING CHAIR,
NADINE WILFORK,

07:13.066 --> 07:15.068
IS A BIG DONOR TO ANWAR.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.737
ARCTIC NATIONAL
WILDLIFE REFUGE -- LOVE IT.

07:17.737 --> 07:19.973
AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
FOR THE REFUGE IS GEESE.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.107
HUH.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.443
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS
DRUNK SHIPPING CAPTAINS.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.445
[LAUGHS]

07:25.445 --> 07:26.980
NOPE.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.717
BUT IF WE REDUCE GEESE IN TEXAS
BEFORE THEY FLY BACK,

07:30.717 --> 07:33.219
NADINE WILL BE HAPPY.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.356
[CHUCKLES]

07:36.356 --> 07:38.358
ONCE AGAIN,
YOU'VE SAVED THE DAY.

07:38.358 --> 07:39.426
[CHUCKLES]

07:39.426 --> 07:41.127
SINCE I'VE ALREADY
BOUGHT YOU COFFEE,

07:41.127 --> 07:42.262
HOW ABOUT
I BUY YOU DINNER?

07:42.262 --> 07:46.266
I KEEP THINKING
I DESERVE MONEY.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.973
WHO'S READY
TO BREAK GROUND

07:52.973 --> 07:55.308
ON A NEW
GUN-RANGE EXPANSION?

07:55.308 --> 07:57.210
BEEN READY.
ARMED AND READY.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.479
OBVIOUSLY.
THAT WAS A RHETORICAL QUESTION.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.016
GREAT! OKAY, TRENT,
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

08:03.016 --> 08:05.318
WELL, GO ON, CRISTELA.
YOU TELL 'EM. IT'S YOUR RODEO.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.619
THANK YOU, SIR.

08:06.619 --> 08:08.588
AND IN THIS RODEO, I'M GUESSING
YOU RODE THE BULL,

08:08.588 --> 08:11.458
AND YOU WERE THAT LITTLE,
GREASY CLOWN SCARING THE KIDS.

08:13.026 --> 08:17.497
SO, WHAT DO YOU GUYS
THINK ABOUT GEESE?

08:17.497 --> 08:20.500
I LIKE THEM FEATHERLESS,
UPSIDE DOWN, AND ROASTED.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.668
NICE.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.504
WELL, NO ONE KEEPS GEESE
FROM RETURNING TO ALASKA

08:24.504 --> 08:26.639
QUITE LIKE
THE HUNTERS IN TEXAS.

08:26.639 --> 08:30.477
HMM.
I ASSURED NADINE WILFORK
THAT OUTDOOR MAN

08:30.477 --> 08:33.013
WOULD GIVE SEMINARS
ON GOOSE HUNTING,

08:33.013 --> 08:36.082
WHICH WILL PROTECT
HER BELOVED ANWAR.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.650
THAT IS A WONDERFUL MOVE.
CONGRATULATIONS.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.552
THANK YOU.
[CHUCKLES]

08:39.552 --> 08:41.087
THAT'S GREAT.
NICELY DONE.

08:41.087 --> 08:42.355
HEY, DAVE.
COME OVER HERE A SECOND.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.190
I WANT YOU
TO GIVE CRISTELA

08:44.190 --> 08:47.193
A LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP
TO THE GUN RANGE.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.095
BUT THE GUN RANGE
IS FREE.

08:49.095 --> 08:52.032
HA! WELL,
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO KNOW THAT.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.501
YOU KNOW, I JUST
WANTED THE KID TO THINK

08:54.501 --> 08:55.702
SHE GOT SOMETHING
OUT OF THE DEAL.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.204
A JOB WELL DONE
IS REWARD ENOUGH.

08:58.204 --> 09:02.175
BESIDES, THERE'S ALREADY
SO MANY ZEROES IN MY PAYCHECK.

09:02.175 --> 09:05.045
THEY'RE ALL ZEROES,
TO BE EXACT.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.081
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS
YOU GOT YOUR PERMIT,

09:08.081 --> 09:10.016
PROVING THAT EVERYTHING
IS BIGGER IN TEXAS.
Mike: IT IS.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.351
YEP.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.187
JUST STANDING AROUND
WITH THREE TOTALLY SECURE MEN,

09:14.187 --> 09:17.123
TALKING ABOUT THE SIZE
OF THEIR GUN RANGE.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.663
Felix:

OH, FELIX, STOP.
ISN'T ALBERTO WITH YOU?

09:35.175 --> 09:36.042
NOPE.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.178
I GOT HIM WORKING ON A JOB
ACROSS TOWN.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.180
HE'LL BE GONE ALL DAY.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.681
SO, ALBERTO'S GONE,

09:41.681 --> 09:43.683

WHAT I'M THINKING?

[Yawning]
I'M TRYING TO.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.572
SORRY. WE --
WE SHOULD HAVE KNOCKED.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.108
JUST...
WHAT? WHY WOULD WE KNOCK?

10:42.108 --> 10:44.043
IT'S OUR BEDROOM!

10:44.043 --> 10:46.613
IT'S A COMMON COURTESY.

10:46.613 --> 10:49.282
AH.

OUR PRIVATE SPACE.

COMING HOME AND FINDING
ALBERTO IN MY BED!

11:18.611 --> 11:21.447
ONE OF YOU DEAL WITH THIS,

I WANT HIM OUT.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.488

11:52.478 --> 11:54.314
I CAN'T LOOK
INTO HIS PUPPY-DOG EYES

11:54.314 --> 11:56.316
AND DELIVER THE BAD NEWS.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.018
I CAN PUT
THAT PUPPY TO SLEEP.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.058
I'M TREATING
MY GUN-RANGE MEMBERSHIP

12:05.058 --> 12:06.526
THE SAME WAY I TREAT

12:09.495 --> 12:11.030
WELL,
YOU MAY NEVER USE IT,

TO KNOW IT'S THERE.

MM-HMM!

12:43.696 --> 12:45.131
IT'S NOT A DATE.

LIKE A DATE TO ME.

ABOUT GUNS AND UNICYCLES.

BEFORE!

CAN YOU PROVE IT?

13:05.184 --> 13:08.621
FOR THE LAST TIME,
IT'S NOT A DATE.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.623
OKAY, CAN THE PERSON
WHO'S ACTUALLY BEEN ON A DATE

13:10.623 --> 13:13.026
GIVE HER OPINION?

13:14.494 --> 13:16.162
IS WORK,
THEN CRIS IS RIGHT.

BUT IF HE WANTS TO
GET TO KNOW YOU AS A PERSON,

13:18.331 --> 13:19.599
THEN IT'S A DATE.

YEAH, AND THEN YOU ARE
IN BIG TROUBLE.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.136
YOU'RE IN BIG,
BIG TROUBLE.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.270
WHY?

13:24.270 --> 13:25.438
BECAUSE HE THINKS
IT'S A DATE.

13:25.438 --> 13:26.506
AND WHEN YOU TELL HIM
IT'S NOT,

13:26.506 --> 13:28.174
HE'S GONNA LOOK
LIKE AN IDIOT IN PUBLIC.

13:28.174 --> 13:31.611
LAWYERS DO NOT LIKE TO BE
HUMILIATED BY INTERNS.

13:31.611 --> 13:35.214
OR CARNIVAL PEOPLE

WHEN DID SHE PASS?

14:28.167 --> 14:30.103
OH, NO, SHE'S ALIVE.

AT THE OFFICE.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.697
WHY DO YOU KEEP
BRINGING UP WORK?

ABOUT DATING

15:24.357 --> 15:26.192
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

15:26.192 --> 15:29.395
NOT REALLY.

15:31.998 --> 15:35.134
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A WORK THING, NOT A DATE.

TO SHOW YOU THAT
BUYING SOMEONE COFFEE

18:21.100 --> 18:23.369
DOESN'T MEAN THAT
THEY WANT TO DATE THEM.

TO PROVE THAT WE WERE WRONG?

19:53.025 --> 19:56.062
WHICH MADE ME REALIZE,
I WOULD LIKE TO.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.097
GO ON A DATE.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.699
WITH YOU.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.701
BUT WHAT ABOUT DATING

20:01.701 --> 20:04.003
GETTING IN THE WAY
OF MY CAREER?

20:04.003 --> 20:07.039
THAT'S AS DUMB
AS MY GENDER THING.

20:07.039 --> 20:11.343
SO YOU SAY
MY THEORY IS DUMB,

20:11.343 --> 20:14.346
BUT YOU ALSO
SAY I'M PRETTY.

20:14.346 --> 20:17.149
I CAN WORK WITH THAT.

20:17.149 --> 20:20.152
I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU COULD
TEACH ME HOW TO SHOOT A GUN,

20:20.152 --> 20:23.022
AND I'LL TEACH YOU
HOW TO RIDE A UNICYCLE.

20:23.022 --> 20:26.225
OR DINNER.
YOU KNOW, DINNER WORKS, TOO.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.127
DINNER IT IS.

20:40.539 --> 20:43.709
OOH...AH...

20:43.709 --> 20:49.715
OOH...

20:49.715 --> 20:51.250
OKAY, I'M ALL SET.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.019
I GUESS THIS IS,
UH, GOODBYE.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.155
GOODBYE.
GOODBYE.
GOODBYE.

20:56.155 --> 20:59.391
I'LL MISS YOU,
<i>MI FAMILIA.</i>

20:59.391 --> 21:02.595
WE CAN'T START MISSING YOU
TILL YOU LEAVE.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.131
CRISTELA,
YOU GONNA MISS ME?

21:05.131 --> 21:09.101
I WON'T MISS YOU
TALKING OVER "SCANDAL."

21:09.101 --> 21:12.138
ALBERTO,
YOU ARE NOT JESUS.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.741
YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE A MEAL
OUT OF YOUR GOODBYE.

21:17.643 --> 21:21.313
I'LL MISS YOU MOST OF ALL,
SCARECROW.
