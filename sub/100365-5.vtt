01:45.981 --> 01:50.110
Attention! You all come!

01:51.153 --> 01:57.075
I want to make a toast
to my oldest daughter Beatrice.

01:59.411 --> 02:02.080
Out of my 22 children...

02:04.750 --> 02:07.294
Beatrice is the most special.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.174
Relax!

02:12.257 --> 02:15.844
You know I love you all.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.848
Just... Beatrice a little bit more.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.894
On the day of Beatrice's birth,

02:23.977 --> 02:28.357
her mother Yuliana grabbed my face
and made me promise...

02:28.440 --> 02:31.693
our first daughter would have
the best education there was.

02:32.486 --> 02:36.657
At the time,
it was an easy promise to make.

02:36.740 --> 02:41.203
I didn't know how much bread
I would have to sell to make it happen.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.707
Beatrice, stand.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.588
It took... at least...

02:51.672 --> 02:54.716
10,000 crates of chapati!

02:56.009 --> 02:58.011
Daddy, you're making those numbers up.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.891
My daughter...

03:03.350 --> 03:06.478
I didn't choose to be a baker.

03:07.104 --> 03:12.150
I became a baker
because my father was a baker.

03:13.151 --> 03:16.905
But we are giving you the opportunity
to find your own path.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.034
My point is go abroad,

03:21.368 --> 03:24.162
study hard and make us proud.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.050
Don't mess this up,

03:37.426 --> 03:38.302
Chosen One.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.096
I'll send for you
when I become rich and famous.

03:48.270 --> 03:49.271
Daddy,

03:49.980 --> 03:51.732
the food was delicious.

03:51.815 --> 03:52.816
Mama.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.026
Are you crying?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.652
No. It's smoke from the oven.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.197
Come here.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.664
I made you something,
in honor of your trip to America.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.542
American-style chocolate chips cookie.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.380
Dad, where did you find chocolate?

04:16.673 --> 04:19.593
I know a guy who knows a guy.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.233
Do you like it?

04:36.443 --> 04:38.695
I love America already!

04:40.113 --> 04:42.157
You're going to do great things.

04:42.491 --> 04:45.619
But don't forget Uganda.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.294
Too sweet.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.155
Congratulations on your divorce.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.574
-Yes.
-Yeah!

05:27.202 --> 05:28.453
The hell with him.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.414
You are finally free of that asshole.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.917
Oh, thank God. Oh, my God.

05:34.793 --> 05:35.836
That's my song.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.799
What was that last drink?
Sex on the Beach?

05:41.925 --> 05:43.677
That was a bad idea.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.013
-That was the one that did it.
-Long-- Long Island.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.683
Rochelle, give me your keys.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.102
-I can't believe we stayed out so late.
-Give us the keys.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.521
Beatrice, your babysitter's gonna be mad.

05:56.899 --> 05:58.984
-Okay.
-Should we open the door?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.903
Rochelle, shh.
Quick, let's just open the door.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.030
-You're gonna-- You're too loud.
-Open--

06:03.113 --> 06:05.157
Keep your voices down. Brian is sleeping.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.451
-I'm sorry, Eunice.
-Sorry we are late.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.537
I'm so sorry. We were celebrating.

06:10.621 --> 06:11.622
I'm going to bed.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.501
It's already tomorrow.
You said you'd be home at 11.

06:15.584 --> 06:19.254
Eunice, why are you so serious?
Next time you should come dancing with us.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.131
Good night, roomies.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.176
How was he? I hope he wasn't difficult.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.262
I know I owe you from last time.

06:27.346 --> 06:28.472
10, hey?

06:28.555 --> 06:29.890
But here, take...

06:30.474 --> 06:31.892
This is 1.

06:32.684 --> 06:33.936
Are you drunk?

06:34.019 --> 06:36.355
Give me a break. I really needed some fun.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.941
I have church in the morning,
and you have robbed me of my sleep

06:39.024 --> 06:40.609
just as you have robbed me of my money.

06:40.692 --> 06:43.445
Eunice, I'll bring the rest tomorrow
when I bring Brian.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.239
You will not. You owe me too much.

06:45.656 --> 06:46.698
Other families pay me.

06:46.782 --> 06:49.868
Please! I have a shift.

06:51.245 --> 06:54.957
You should have thought of that before
you contracted Saturday Night Fever.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.084
Get your life together.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.639
Mommy?

07:52.723 --> 07:56.018
Baby, what are you doing awake?
It's the middle of the night.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.353
I smell cookies.

07:59.730 --> 08:00.939
Can I have one?

08:01.023 --> 08:03.859
No. These are for people at Mommy's work.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.112
-Please.
-Okay. One.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.324
We'll split it, okay?
And then back to bed.

08:18.874 --> 08:20.083
Is it good?

08:23.420 --> 08:24.922
Yummy, yummy.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.017
Hello?

08:37.100 --> 08:39.227
Brian, where's your mother?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.688
She's here. She's asleep.

08:44.566 --> 08:45.567
Dear Jesus!

08:46.735 --> 08:47.903
Hello, Mommy.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.363
Bea-Bea, were you asleep?

08:49.446 --> 08:51.698
It's almost 11:00 a.m. there.

08:51.782 --> 08:53.617
No, no. I've been up for hours.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.245
Grab Mommy's uniform and shoes. Hurry.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.372
I hear you were out dancing last night.

08:58.747 --> 09:03.085
Mama, why do you call me when you can
just get your information from Eunice?

09:03.877 --> 09:06.797
If my daughter told me
what was going on in her life,

09:06.880 --> 09:08.799
I wouldn't have to talk to Eunice.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.301
Ma, I have to go work...

09:11.677 --> 09:15.013
A degree in marine science,
but you are handing out french fries.

09:15.347 --> 09:18.433
Thank God your father
is not alive to see this.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.769
You're divorced,

09:20.853 --> 09:23.105
sleeping on your friends' couch...

09:23.355 --> 09:25.315
What kind of life do you want for Brian?

09:25.983 --> 09:27.317
It's time to come home.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.112
You've become a spoiled American.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.530
Okay, Mama.

09:33.532 --> 09:34.658
My love,

09:35.033 --> 09:38.161
you're the first woman in our family
to go to college.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.622
Why do you continue wasting
your education?

09:41.415 --> 09:43.500
Mum, I got to go to work. Bye.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.586
-Wait...
-Come.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.263
-Is Frank around?
-At dialysis.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.389
-Okay.
-Oh, no.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.099
I know. I know. Baby, come.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.059
Okay, go sit at that booth and don't move.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.687
I'm going to bring you crayons,
and don't eat them again.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.314
When Frank comes,
what are you going to do?

10:05.397 --> 10:07.024
-Hide.
-Yes.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.610
-Hi.
-Beatrice, they put the peppers in.

10:09.693 --> 10:12.196
The bastards.
I'll have Mike make you a new one.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.530
In the meantime...

10:14.698 --> 10:17.117
Your cookies
are the real reason we come here.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.579
When are you going to let us feed you?

10:20.662 --> 10:22.039
When you make pizza edible.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.000
You are a crazy person.
Everyone loves pizza.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.294
It just feels like half an idea.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.130
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.927
Baby, put that down. Drop it.
Why are you doing that?

10:35.260 --> 10:37.221
It's boring here.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.305
I'll get you a snack.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.724
Hey, sweetheart. How you doing?

10:41.058 --> 10:42.267
What's he doing here?

10:42.351 --> 10:45.187
He wanted to see you after your dialysis.

10:45.854 --> 10:46.939
How are you doing, Frank?

10:48.190 --> 10:51.068
I'm not great. My kidneys aren't great.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.403
It's just today.

10:53.487 --> 10:54.613
It's always "just today"!

10:54.696 --> 10:57.032
It was today yesterday,
and it's gonna be today tomorrow.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.075
Damn it!

11:01.537 --> 11:04.873
Look, this is it.
I can't have a kid running around in here.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.875
I lost my babysitter.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.710
Frank, cut her some slack.

11:08.794 --> 11:12.464
I'm not the bad guy here. I let you
sell your cookies at the register.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.174
Because you take half my profit.

11:14.258 --> 11:15.801
Because it's my business.

11:15.884 --> 11:19.888
I warned you last time. If you can't
get a babysitter, you can't work here.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.140
Get out.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.103
Frank, I have a child to support.
I need this job.

11:27.062 --> 11:28.146
You're fired.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.235
Then I'm taking my cookies with me. Come.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.446
-And your pies suck!
-Yeah, well, your cookies...

11:36.530 --> 11:38.323
Well, they're good.

11:40.576 --> 11:43.036
-I'm tired.
-We are almost home, okay?

11:43.453 --> 11:47.124
Can you just please walk?
You are big boy now. Walk.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.501
-I don't want to.
-Please. My arms are tired.

11:49.585 --> 11:52.629
-Carry me! No, no!
-Please.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.091
-Carry me! Carry me!
-Brian, stop it.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.762
That's a tough age, huh?

12:02.556 --> 12:04.892
Are you currently happy
with your brand of lipstick?

12:04.975 --> 12:06.143
What?

12:06.226 --> 12:09.855
I'm introducing the neighborhood to a new
line of cosmetics for the working woman.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.648
I just lost my job.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.944
I was unemployed, too,
until Avon saved my life.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.654
And now I'm my own boss.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.284
Let me give you a free sample.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.375
Have a great day!

12:31.418 --> 12:35.047
Don't worry. Mommy's going to fix this.

13:17.214 --> 13:18.382
Excuse me.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.842
Hi. May I help you with something?

13:19.925 --> 13:22.135
Yes. I'm looking for a lady's suit.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.762
Okay. What kind?

13:23.846 --> 13:25.430
A successful business suit.

13:26.223 --> 13:28.392
Like Connie Chung or like Dynasty?

13:28.475 --> 13:31.186
Actually, I don't even know
why I'm asking. We only have one.

13:31.270 --> 13:35.941
It is $4, it's green and it's right here.

13:36.567 --> 13:37.943
What do you think of that?

13:39.695 --> 13:44.533
Hello. I am introducing the neighborhood
to a new line of very exciting cookies.

13:44.616 --> 13:45.701
Oh, no, thank you.

13:49.204 --> 13:50.247
Hello.

13:50.330 --> 13:54.376
I'm here in the neighborhood introducing
a new line of exciting cookies.

13:56.253 --> 13:59.089
Hello.
Would you like to buy a delicious cookie?

13:59.173 --> 14:01.091
Sorry, I already bought a pack of Oreos.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.218
These are better than Oreos.

14:03.302 --> 14:06.054
Got to get them
before they get into the supermarket.

14:06.805 --> 14:09.391
Excuse me, sir.
Are you interested in buying a cookie?

14:10.017 --> 14:13.562
What's this, for charity or something?
Y'all saving the whales?

14:13.645 --> 14:14.771
For eating.

14:16.064 --> 14:19.860
I'm not really a dessert guy, but here.

14:20.611 --> 14:21.904
It's for your kid.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.157
You forgot your cookie.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.491
He doesn't want it.

14:31.622 --> 14:34.958
Excuse me, sir. Can I introduce you
to a new line of exciting--

14:35.042 --> 14:37.544
You can't be here. There's no soliciting.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.548
But I've seen people
selling cookies here before.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.842
Yeah, Girl Scouts.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.844
We can't have any panhandlers.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.805
I'm not panhandling. I'm selling cookies.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.642
Just do it somewhere else. Thank you.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.109
I am never shopping
at that Piggly Wiggly again.

15:03.362 --> 15:05.155
Don't you dare answer that.

15:05.239 --> 15:07.741
You know who it is,
and you're just starting to feel better.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.577
If I don't pick it up,
she'll keep calling.

15:10.661 --> 15:13.205
If you do pick it up,
you'll feel like garbage.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.373
I already do.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.376
I can't pay you rent. I'm divorced.

15:17.459 --> 15:20.170
I was supposed to be here two weeks.
It's been eight months.

15:20.254 --> 15:21.338
We don't mind.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.215
We love having you here.

15:25.425 --> 15:29.555
And I just got fired by a guy
who makes key lime pie with lemons.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.058
Have you told your mom you got fired?

15:34.393 --> 15:36.436
Never. Can you imagine?

15:36.520 --> 15:38.313
"Oh, my God, Bea-Bea.

15:39.690 --> 15:43.986
You went to college
and you can't even keep a job at a diner.

15:44.069 --> 15:47.865
And now you are out there in the street
selling the cookies.

15:47.948 --> 15:48.949
Oh, my God.

15:49.032 --> 15:53.203
Cookies, cookies, who wants a cookie?"

15:53.912 --> 15:55.747
-Oh, my God.
-What?

15:55.831 --> 15:57.833
Excuse me, that is a superpower.

15:57.916 --> 16:01.503
Okay, I might be really drunk,
but you go out there like that, and--

16:01.587 --> 16:04.298
No, seriously,
that shit's gonna make you famous.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.925
Come on,
every woman in Uganda can do this.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.636
But, girl, you're in Louisville, Kentucky.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.267
Cookies. Cookies. We are selling cookies.

16:15.726 --> 16:17.019
Who wants cookies?

16:18.687 --> 16:20.731
Cookies. Cookies.
Do you like some cookies?

16:20.814 --> 16:21.982
-Smile.
-No, thank you.

16:42.336 --> 16:44.713
Cookies. The best cookies in Louisville.

16:45.297 --> 16:46.423
No, thank you.

16:46.924 --> 16:48.425
-Cookies. Co--
-Hey.

16:49.551 --> 16:52.387
I dig your outfit. Those colors...

16:52.471 --> 16:53.889
Why is that on your head?

16:53.972 --> 16:56.725
I'm selling some cookies.

16:57.351 --> 17:03.315
50 cents for one, but for you, my friends,
I'll give you two for $1.

17:03.398 --> 17:06.443
Hell, yeah. We'll take, like, a lot.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.569
Like a dozen? I'll give you a discount.

17:09.655 --> 17:10.864
We totally need a dozen.

17:10.948 --> 17:11.949
Yeah.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.367
Yes. Yes. Yes.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.536
And 12.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.079
Go get the money.

17:19.248 --> 17:21.625
How's that staying on your head right now?

17:22.584 --> 17:24.002
African magic.

17:26.922 --> 17:28.632
Cookies. Cookies.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.592
-That car smells funny.
-Who wants a cookie?

17:30.676 --> 17:33.095
The best cookies in Louisville.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.805
Cookies.

18:31.653 --> 18:32.779
Dear Jesus!

18:33.113 --> 18:36.783
I thought being a waitress at a restaurant
was the bottom.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.244
But now you are a waitress
on the sidewalk.

18:39.328 --> 18:40.162
Mama.

18:40.245 --> 18:44.666
This isn't Uganda.
It's not shameful work here.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.295
I'm selling cookies. Dad was a baker.

18:48.545 --> 18:52.257
I can take care of my son
like Dad took care of us.

18:52.341 --> 18:54.051
Bea-Bea, my love...

18:54.134 --> 18:56.428
those cookies have made your brain soft.

18:56.762 --> 19:01.600
What must Brian think
when he sees you begging on the sidewalk?

19:02.226 --> 19:05.020
I have spoken with your brothers.

19:05.437 --> 19:08.232
We have pooled together the money
for you to come home.

19:08.607 --> 19:10.817
We emptied our savings,

19:10.901 --> 19:13.403
and we are giving it to you to come back.

19:13.654 --> 19:15.697
I've had some ups and downs,

19:15.781 --> 19:17.574
but I finally found something
that I'm good at.

19:17.908 --> 19:19.243
And it's working.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.496
Mama, you and Dad sent me here to succeed,

19:22.704 --> 19:24.289
and I will succeed.

19:24.373 --> 19:25.916
It's not up for discussion.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.502
Call me tomorrow
after you've received the money.

19:36.802 --> 19:37.886
Enjoy.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.556
Thank you.

19:40.639 --> 19:42.349
Yes, how can I help you?

19:42.432 --> 19:43.976
Hey! Hello.

19:44.852 --> 19:48.730
Two chocolate chip
for Louisville's finest. On the house.

19:48.814 --> 19:50.816
No, thank you, ma'am.
You can't do this here.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.194
It's okay. I'm a taxpayer.

19:54.570 --> 19:56.989
Okay. Well, you still can't just
sell food on the street.

20:00.409 --> 20:02.369
What's the matter? Am I in trouble?

20:02.911 --> 20:04.288
What's your name?

20:04.621 --> 20:05.956
Beatrice Mukasa.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.667
-Bea-- "Mukasta"? How do you spell it?
-Mukasa.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.753
-How do you spell that?
-M-U-K-A-S-A.

20:13.172 --> 20:14.548
What's the problem?

20:14.631 --> 20:17.092
You need a commercial license
and a retail space.

20:17.176 --> 20:18.177
A what?

20:18.260 --> 20:21.597
All right.
You can pay that down at city hall.

20:21.930 --> 20:22.931
Pay?

20:23.015 --> 20:25.267
Well, that's how it works in this country.

20:35.027 --> 20:39.823
"And then at night, all the animals
return to their homes to sleep."

20:45.787 --> 20:47.122
Would you like that?

20:48.165 --> 20:50.501
To go to a faraway land.

20:50.918 --> 20:53.212
And you can meet your grandma.

20:53.879 --> 20:56.757
-And your uncles.
-Yeah. And animals.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.635
And we could even see real zebras.

20:59.718 --> 21:01.303
I wanna go.

21:01.845 --> 21:06.433
If you like, I could even teach you
how to bake bread in the ground.

21:06.517 --> 21:08.143
In the ground?

21:10.646 --> 21:15.526
Your grandfather used to dig
a big hole in the ground

21:16.109 --> 21:17.986
and fill it up with charcoal.

21:19.071 --> 21:20.739
Hot, hot charcoal.

21:21.532 --> 21:23.992
And then he would give me soft dough

21:24.076 --> 21:26.912
and he'd let me stuff it in in the coals,

21:27.287 --> 21:29.873
and then we'd wait until it puffed up.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.170
Then he'd give me a chunk of it.

21:39.508 --> 21:43.178
It was so hot,
you would even burn your hands.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.143
The best bread I ever had.

22:00.904 --> 22:03.740
Uganda. Uganda.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.326
Uganda.

22:06.410 --> 22:08.871
Okay, it's gonna be three segments.

22:08.954 --> 22:13.333
Louisville to JFK, JFK to Gatwick,
and Gatwick to...

22:13.834 --> 22:14.835
Entebbe.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.253
Entebbe. Right.

22:17.004 --> 22:19.381
$1,800 if he sits on your lap.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.426
I think that's a pretty good deal
for this time of year.

22:22.885 --> 22:25.345
Tell that to my eight brothers
who had to chip in.

22:26.722 --> 22:28.891
You must be really excited to go back,
huh?

22:46.783 --> 22:47.784
Hello?

22:50.787 --> 22:52.414
Excuse me, can I help you?

22:59.963 --> 23:01.256
You stole my money!

23:01.340 --> 23:05.886
I'm sorry. I know it seems crazy,
but I had to do it. I will pay you back.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.096
Your father and I did not raise you
to be this way!

23:08.722 --> 23:10.766
You are a selfish American!

23:11.225 --> 23:14.937
Going to America was your dream. Not mine.

23:15.020 --> 23:16.271
You're right. It was my dream.

23:16.688 --> 23:20.692
You got a chance every girl here
would die for. And you squandered it!

23:21.026 --> 23:22.194
And you are a thief!

23:22.277 --> 23:24.112
You bet on me
by sending me to this country.

23:24.196 --> 23:25.739
Now I'm betting on me.

23:25.822 --> 23:26.907
You are not my daughter.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.284
Mama.

23:30.369 --> 23:32.162
You don't mean that.

23:32.246 --> 23:33.622
I do!

23:44.716 --> 23:47.803
Wait! That is mine.
Where are you taking my counter?

23:47.886 --> 23:48.887
To the truck.

23:49.513 --> 23:51.223
Hey, Beatrice, don't worry.

23:51.306 --> 23:53.684
The space will be cleared out
in 15 minutes.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.060
Cleared out? Why?

23:55.561 --> 23:58.438
Well, all the equipment and furniture
are moving across town.

23:58.522 --> 24:00.858
-Excuse me.
-We got our new restaurant there.

24:01.775 --> 24:03.652
What about the oven?

24:04.152 --> 24:05.779
Gotta take that too.

24:07.322 --> 24:10.617
Aw, no, did you think all this stuff
came with the space?

24:12.661 --> 24:13.912
Sorry.

24:21.795 --> 24:25.090
Finally! You came for a pizza.

24:25.174 --> 24:28.093
Quick favor. What time do you guys close?

24:28.427 --> 24:31.930
10:00 p.m.
11:00 p.m. on weekends. Why?

24:33.724 --> 24:36.101
Just remember to pull down the gate
after you lock up.

24:36.185 --> 24:39.730
Thank you. I'll pay you guys back
as soon as I make anything.

24:39.813 --> 24:41.273
No one is here anyway.

24:41.356 --> 24:43.525
Now, don't open the door for anyone.

24:43.609 --> 24:46.028
Sometimes there's a crazy drunk man
who comes around.

24:46.111 --> 24:47.237
Does he like cookies?

24:49.323 --> 24:50.490
I'm serious.

24:52.576 --> 24:53.952
-Thank you.
-Okay, bye-bye.

25:39.498 --> 25:41.458
Free samples of cookies!

25:42.584 --> 25:44.253
Get your free cookie samples.

25:45.796 --> 25:47.548
Here you go. Take two.

25:48.549 --> 25:50.759
-Thanks. Have a good day.
-Thank you.

25:52.427 --> 25:54.263
Yeah!

25:57.808 --> 25:59.226
Thank you.

26:00.269 --> 26:01.103
Hi.

26:52.946 --> 26:54.323
Hello?

26:56.617 --> 26:58.744
Hello, Mama...

27:04.625 --> 27:05.626
Thank you.

27:15.093 --> 27:16.428
Hello, Mama.

27:18.138 --> 27:19.181
Brian.

27:21.350 --> 27:23.143
Welcome, Grandma!

27:27.814 --> 27:30.859
Your mama tells me you love zebras.

27:30.943 --> 27:32.027
Huh?

27:32.110 --> 27:33.654
Thank you, Grandma.

27:36.031 --> 27:37.783
Let me take your bag.

27:55.217 --> 27:57.427
This is my new place.

28:05.686 --> 28:07.563
You'll take my room.

28:08.146 --> 28:10.232
You rest. I'll make you something to eat.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.866
I'm glad you're here, Mama.

28:21.159 --> 28:22.244
Thank you for coming.

28:43.390 --> 28:44.433
Thank you.

28:46.685 --> 28:47.686
Bye, Cookie Lady.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.730
Bye-bye, my friends.

28:50.898 --> 28:53.567
My mom is the Cookie Lady!

28:53.650 --> 28:55.402
Yes, she is!

28:57.863 --> 28:59.781
Brian, come over here
and sit down with me.

29:02.993 --> 29:05.370
Mama. Come.

29:11.376 --> 29:12.794
Chocolate chip.

29:25.015 --> 29:26.266
How is it?

29:29.603 --> 29:30.771
Very sweet.

29:33.106 --> 29:34.775
Thank you, Mama.

29:38.070 --> 29:39.988
Brian. Show me which one you want.

29:40.948 --> 29:43.534
I know which one you are going to choose.
Come!

29:45.410 --> 29:47.037
-Which one?
-Cinnamon roll.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.455
Bring your money.
