WEBVTT

00:07.757 --> 00:09.509
Storm’s really in the
good books at the moment.

00:09.551 --> 00:12.178
It’s nice to have him
around to, like, cuddle.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.910
I do want Dave to realize
that there is this line

00:35.952 --> 00:37.328
that he cannot cross.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.414
I can’t deal with
the messages, like...

00:40.582 --> 00:42.375
I’m still ----ing
in love with her,

00:42.417 --> 00:44.085
but that’s not happening,
so I need to be able

00:44.127 --> 00:45.253
to just push it away.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.382
-Oh!
-[crash]

00:49.424 --> 00:50.884
Oh!

00:50.925 --> 00:52.719
Do you need medical?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.012
You twisted your ankle?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.388
My heart is in my stomach.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.891
These guests are
very demanding.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.851
Ah!

00:59.893 --> 01:03.438
So, to lose one from your team,
I literally feel sick.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.153
Kyle’s obviously upset
because he wants

01:10.195 --> 01:12.072
to finish the season,
but, I mean,

01:12.113 --> 01:13.907
we’re quite short-handed
as it is.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.658
Yes, you need a third person.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.415
To say goodbye is one
of the most difficult moments

01:22.457 --> 01:23.500
for me that I’ve had.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.794
-Bye, Kyle!
-Love you guys!

01:38.390 --> 01:40.225
I know, it’s not just...

01:48.024 --> 01:50.151
What don’t you see that I see?

01:51.820 --> 01:53.321
Oh!

02:00.620 --> 02:01.705
Thank you, Reid.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.458
We just must get all
of the linens off the beds...

02:05.500 --> 02:06.960
Uh-huh.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.504
And all of the towels, we
just need to wash everything.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.339
Everyone is exhausted.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.717
Last charter ----ed
all of us,

02:13.758 --> 02:15.969
and there’s still
an overwhelming

02:16.011 --> 02:16.970
amount of work to be done.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.471
[bleep].

02:18.513 --> 02:21.433
Feel like we’re in the
sh-- in this scenario.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.310
David, Natasha, and Storm,
meet me in the crew mess

02:24.352 --> 02:26.980
for charter number nine
preference sheet meeting.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.023
Copy.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.401
All right.

02:31.443 --> 02:33.278
-So, we made it.
-We did indeed.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.405
Charter number nine,
final charter.

02:35.447 --> 02:38.324
Co-primaries Josh Joseph
and his daughter, Sydney Joseph,

02:38.366 --> 02:40.577
are the founders of their
own investment company.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.787
They’re joined by business
partners Ashley and Michael,

02:42.829 --> 02:45.999
aka Mook, the business
partner/NFL players

02:46.041 --> 02:49.085
Dominique Easley
and Jordan Reed.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.253
I think that the football boys

02:50.295 --> 02:51.796
are gonna put some
food back, hey?

02:51.838 --> 02:53.214
I don’t know anything
about American football.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.050
I watch a sh-- ton of
Premier League.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.176
Liverpool for life, baby.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.510
You never ----ing walk alone.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.554
For dinner, surf-and-turf
celebration.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.681
Guests request
steak and lobster dinner.

03:01.723 --> 03:05.393
Guests request a classic take
on a Las Vegas casino party.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.354
In the afternoon,
the guests would like

03:07.395 --> 03:09.230
to play on all the water toys.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.692
Final charter.
Tomorrow we board, 12:00.

03:12.734 --> 03:16.571
Guests will board us on anchor
due to potential weather.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.490
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Captain.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.908
Thank you, Sandy.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.244
Ugh!

03:30.752 --> 03:32.712
But I think you should be
on your normal shift,

03:32.754 --> 03:34.214
because you can still
do dinner service with me.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.632
Mm.

03:35.674 --> 03:38.051
But she’s late as in,
like, Kyle was with me,

03:38.093 --> 03:39.761
so then she can just clear up.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.180
I think she’ll be quick,
she’s a housekeeping stew.

03:42.222 --> 03:46.768
It’s been me and Kyle on
service the entire season.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.144
I just need to get...
from the sundeck

03:48.186 --> 03:49.521
No, I can grab that up.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.232
Yeah, I’ve got your
tequila coming up.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.484
-Uh-uh.
-My asshole burns.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.574
Nat’s someone that
I don’t get along with.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.411
For her to actually
be stuck with me,

04:04.452 --> 04:07.956
it could potentially be
a bit of a disaster.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.708
Forty-eight hours.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.751
That’s all we need to get
through is the next 48 hours,

04:11.793 --> 04:13.003
and we’re done.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.591
Last charter.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.553
Mm, it’s, like,
bittersweet for me.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.596
It’s gonna be weird.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.307
Meeting Nat and having
the connection with her

04:26.349 --> 04:29.352
that I have, you know, I don’t
really wanna say goodbye to her.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.771
I suck at goodbyes.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.463
Here we go, this is it.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.633
Last charter.

05:00.675 --> 05:01.760
Ooh!

05:01.801 --> 05:03.511
Oh, no, look at
the weather.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.888
Oh sh--, where did
that come from?

05:04.929 --> 05:08.099
It looks like it may
just be spotted clouds.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.143
Tash when this girl
comes and she says--

05:10.185 --> 05:11.728
She’s coming now.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.646
Okay, rule number one,
no bitchiness.

05:13.688 --> 05:14.689
Yeah.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.899
I can’t deal with
that right now.

05:15.940 --> 05:16.900
We’re too tired.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.401
We got to get out
with our lives.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.195
I think that she’s
gonna be cute.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.363
Yes, sir.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.324
The water taxi’s here.

05:24.366 --> 05:27.786
-Hi!
-Hi!

05:27.827 --> 05:30.038
The new stew.

05:30.080 --> 05:34.209
-Okay.
-You look amazing.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.293
Thank you, you too!

05:35.335 --> 05:36.628
Oh, I’m Tasha.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.629
Tasha, I’m Ellie,
nice to meet you.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.089
Nice to meet you.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.799
So, let me take my shoes off
before I ruin the teak,

05:40.840 --> 05:41.966
-I don’t wanna...
-Ooh, look at your toenails.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.760
Have you just had
them shellacked?

05:43.802 --> 05:46.262
Thanks, I had... I did them
myself yesterday, actually.

05:46.304 --> 05:49.599
My previous experience was
working on a cruise line.

05:49.641 --> 05:52.894
I only worked in the spa there,
versus on a yacht.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.730
As a stewardess,
you kind of do everything.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.525
I am a little bit out of
my comfort zone, you know?

05:58.566 --> 05:59.818
-Hi, how you doing?
- Hi, hi.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.695
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.571
-I’m sorry, my hands are full.
-How you doing, you well?

06:03.613 --> 06:04.739
Let me give you a hug.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.116
-What’s your name again?
-Dave.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.534
Dave... nice to meet you, Dave,
I’m Ellie.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.536
Nice to meet you, Ellie.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.746
Down to the crew areas.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.582
-Meet Courtney now.
-Hello.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.918
Hi... hi, Courtney,
how are you?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.670
-This is Ellie.
-Good, thanks, how are you?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.046
Great, nice to meet you.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.548
You look so glam,
you look amazing.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.799
I’m Natalya.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.676
Hi, nice to meet you,
hi, Natalya.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.885
So nice to have you on board.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.178
Thank you!

06:27.220 --> 06:29.264
Very glamorous Elena,
like, we’re on a yacht,

06:29.305 --> 06:31.057
but off to, like,
a fashion show.

06:31.099 --> 06:34.477
Like, I hope she’s ready
to get her hands dirty,

06:34.519 --> 06:35.979
because she’s going
into housekeeping.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.940
-Oh, this is cute.
-So, this one’s your bed.

06:38.982 --> 06:39.733
Okay.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.359
Here’s your uniform,

06:41.401 --> 06:44.070
and take you up to the bridge
to see Captain Sandy.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.613
Awesome, yay.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.282
-Whereabouts are you from?
-From Slovenia.

06:47.323 --> 06:51.453
I felt like, you know, at
least that was my experience,

06:51.494 --> 06:52.996
that’s how I saw Sedona,

06:53.038 --> 06:56.416
and I kind of had
to learn all these

06:56.458 --> 06:57.834
different languages
as a child.

06:57.876 --> 07:01.546
So, my first interest
was linguistics.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.716
I’ve got a bachelor’s degree
in English and Russian languages

07:04.758 --> 07:06.926
and literature, and my first job

07:06.968 --> 07:08.845
was being a translator,
actually.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.765
I’m currently working
on my seventh language,

07:11.806 --> 07:13.516
which is Mandarin Chinese.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.809
[speaking Mandarin]

07:20.482 --> 07:22.108
Hi, hi, Captain,
nice to meet you.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.443
-Hi, hi, good morning.
-You too.

07:23.485 --> 07:24.986
-Good morning.
-Welcome aboard.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.363
Thank you so much,
thank you for having me.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.781
I’m happy to be here.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.823
Yeah, that’s great,
and I really appreciate

07:28.865 --> 07:29.908
you coming on board for this.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.326
-Of course.
-Thank you.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.577
Okay, thank you, Captain.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.204
Nice girl.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.955
Is she nice?

07:35.997 --> 07:37.040
Yeah?

07:37.082 --> 07:39.417
Hi!

07:39.459 --> 07:40.627
Oh, have you met Storm?

07:40.669 --> 07:41.795
-Hi.
-I have not met anybody.

07:41.836 --> 07:42.796
-Nice to meet you, pleasure.
-Storm.

07:42.837 --> 07:43.838
Hi, nice to meet you.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.340
-Storm?
-Nice to meet you.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.591
-What a cool name, awesome.
-Thank you very much.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.759
I’m Ellie.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.971
Thank you so much for coming.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.349
Well, I’m here
for whatever you need.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.393
All right,
I’ll see you soon.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.936
Okay, I’ll be there
in a minute.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.979
Once she’s changed, then do
you maybe wanna give her

08:00.021 --> 08:01.773
a quick explanation
of the laundry,

08:01.815 --> 08:03.441
so that when she comes in
she knows the system?

08:03.483 --> 08:04.609
Yeah.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.444
Courts, have you
met the new stew?

08:06.486 --> 08:07.570
Yeah, she’s sexy.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.239
Oh, yeah?

08:09.280 --> 08:11.032
Mm-hmm, you’ll like her.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.992
Although she’s about
double your height.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.662
You’ll be mainly on laundry
and housekeeping for this trip,

08:15.704 --> 08:18.748
which has been Nat’s baby.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.042
I think you’ve done
laundry, haven’t you?

08:21.084 --> 08:22.752
I’m definitely, like,
freaking out,

08:22.794 --> 08:24.337
not being in control
over the laundry.

08:24.379 --> 08:27.173
But I’m like, oh, like, I think
I’ve got high standards,

08:27.215 --> 08:30.260
so it’s hard to let someone
else take the reins

08:30.301 --> 08:33.888
when I’ve already got an idea in
my head of how things should be.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.058
See, that’s good.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.059
Awesome, yes.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.687
Oh, it’s the provisioner.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.023
Storm, Storm, provisions
are waiting on the dock

08:43.064 --> 08:45.358
for us at the closest
jetty to us.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.610
All right, thanks, Tash,
we’ll get on it now.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.280
-You two can go?
-Yeah.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.328
Are you on, Johnny?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.622
Bridge, bridge,
that’s the tender away

08:59.664 --> 09:01.041
with Courtney and Mzi.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.042
Copy, Courts.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.133
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.302
I’m having a bit of trouble
with the ironing board.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.596
It’s a little bit hard
to open it.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.182
It’s probably me,
I don’t know.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.352
I pressed over here
to release it, and then...

09:20.393 --> 09:22.062
oh, my God.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.730
Oh, okay, okay.

09:23.772 --> 09:26.566
She needed the old
one, two hit-a-roo.

09:26.608 --> 09:27.859
Yeah.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.029
Okay, never used this before.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.740
ETA, like, four minutes.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.241
Copy that, thank you.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.828
Oh, my God.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.882
Oh.

09:57.972 --> 09:58.848
Hi.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.975
Provisions, provisions.

10:02.686 --> 10:03.937
-Hello!
-Hey, I’m Reid.

10:03.978 --> 10:04.979
My name is Elena,
nice to meet you.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.272
Pleasure to meet you.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.816
This is just going
to the main table.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.025
Main table over here?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.694
Yeah, you can walk trough these.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.446
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.907
Wow, this girl is beautiful.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.622
Have I got the disco balls in...

10:22.664 --> 10:23.832
Don’t be shellfish, mate.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.336
Oh.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.634
Okay, wow.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.344
Dear Jesus.

10:39.556 --> 10:40.765
-Dave?
-Yeah?

10:40.807 --> 10:43.143
With the lunch,
is it soup for starter?

10:43.184 --> 10:46.271
I’m doing, like,
Mediterranean Greek lamb kofta,

10:46.312 --> 10:48.356
and I’m gonna do
a nice grilled sea bass.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.026
All crew, all crew,
get into your whites.

10:51.067 --> 10:54.070
<i>Meet me on the swim platform</i>
<i>at 11:50.</i>

10:54.112 --> 10:55.155
Okay, copy.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.698
This is Tash.

11:02.537 --> 11:03.538
Ladies first.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.622
-Hello.
-Hello!

11:04.664 --> 11:06.166
-Hi.
-Hi, good afternoon.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.334
<i>All crew, all crew, guests</i>
<i>are in the water taxi.</i>

11:07.375 --> 11:08.710
We’re all good.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.339
She’s coming.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.507
All right.

11:14.549 --> 11:15.633
Here we go.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.218
Oh, here they come.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.473
Oh!

11:21.514 --> 11:23.683
Last charters always
drag on for some reason.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.727
It’s like your body knows
that you’re coming to an end,

11:25.769 --> 11:27.354
so it starts, like,
to shut down.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.856
I’m super exhausted and
we haven’t had time at all

11:29.898 --> 11:31.483
to train the new stewardess.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.693
We’re basically giving Ellie
a rag and said,

11:33.735 --> 11:34.903
like, do the cabins.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.198
The boat is not...

11:40.367 --> 11:41.910
Here they are.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.703
-Coming up...
-Woo!

11:43.745 --> 11:46.373
Ooh!

11:59.386 --> 11:59.803
Welcome aboard.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.597
How you doing, how you doing,
how you doing?

12:02.639 --> 12:03.932
Good, welcome.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.058
I’m Dominique,
nice to meet you.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.142
I know who you are.
Welcome.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.185
Actually, it’s nice to meet you.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.395
You too, I’m so happy.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.521
How are you?

12:09.562 --> 12:10.855
Hi, I’m Courtney,
nice to meet you.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.357
These guys are hot.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.025
The only thing I really know
about American football,

12:14.067 --> 12:19.030
I think, is that they
say, like, "32 hut."

12:19.072 --> 12:22.117
We’ve got some cold towels here,
if you’d like, from Ellie.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.369
If you’d like to refresh
your hands at all, or no?

12:24.411 --> 12:25.870
Sure, thank you!

12:25.912 --> 12:26.955
Thank you so much,
I appreciate it.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.206
Natasha is gonna
show you around,

12:28.248 --> 12:29.499
and then we’re gonna
get settled in.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.543
We’ll do an exterior
tour first.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.961
Cool.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.381
Here’s the bridge deck aft.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.676
Most meals will take
place at this table.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.177
You got some pancakes
on the boat?

12:41.219 --> 12:42.762
-No pancakes.
-No pancakes?

12:42.804 --> 12:44.431
We’ll have pancakes later.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.516
I eat pancakes for breakfast,
for lunch, for dinner... yeah.

12:46.558 --> 12:47.934
Oh!

12:47.976 --> 12:49.144
I’ll get Chef Dave
to make some for you.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.478
Any particular flavor?

12:50.520 --> 12:52.313
No, just a particular way.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.440
Okay.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.524
Last one, brother.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.235
-Yes.
-Up here, we have the Jacuzzi.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.446
-It is gorgeous.
-It is gorgeous.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.824
Boy, these damn stairs
ain’t good for my knees, boy.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.325
Thanks, guys.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.910
Oh, wow, Gucci.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.831
Then we can head through down
to the owner’s suite.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.250
These stairs look crazy
right now!

13:12.292 --> 13:13.668
It seems a little bit dangerous.

13:13.710 --> 13:14.961
Forget the stairs.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.422
-Holy sh--.
-This is beautiful.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.383
-Perfect, we’ll take it.
-That would be, yeah.

13:20.425 --> 13:24.346
Captain Sandy,
the Kris Jenner of yachting.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.015
She’s a momager,
she’s a manager,

13:27.057 --> 13:29.517
she’s a yachtager,
she’s Captain Sandy.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.019
Let’s go check out
the other places.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.187
You going downstairs?

13:32.228 --> 13:33.855
One more time...
can you do this?

13:33.897 --> 13:35.857
Sh--.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.400
So, this is the VIP suite.

13:37.442 --> 13:38.818
-Ooh!
-Oh!

13:38.860 --> 13:40.445
And then the other cabins
are kind of very similar.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.280
Listen, I am not gonna feel
comfortable sleeping

13:42.322 --> 13:44.366
with that much water right
next to my head like that.

13:44.407 --> 13:46.284
You can’t escape the water, bro.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.535
No, no, no,
I know I can’t escape it,

13:47.577 --> 13:49.662
but I’m gonna take
my ass upstairs.

13:49.704 --> 13:53.333
Please, sir, may I have
some of your money?

13:53.375 --> 13:55.418
Hey, we’re done with
the tour, right?

13:55.460 --> 13:56.836
Yes.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.880
All right, my love,
I’m gonna get changed quickly.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.424
Okay, guys, let’s all
get changed into our wets.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.592
Yeah, copy.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.514
Where are you from?

14:07.555 --> 14:08.556
Australia, from Perth.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.891
-Beautiful.
-Yeah.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.434
A dream of mine is
to hold a koala bear.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.894
Oh, my God, everyone
thinks they’re really

14:12.936 --> 14:14.396
soft and cuddly...
they’re not.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.898
They scratch you,
and they also have chlamydia.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.525
No way!
That is crazy.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.235
It’s a fact, it’s
actually a fact.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.736
Everyone’s like, "Oh, they
look so cute and stuff."

14:21.778 --> 14:23.238
They’re not, they’re furry
and they...

14:23.279 --> 14:24.531
-And they’ll give you an STD.
-Yeah.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.408
Get the slide out,
get the toys out.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.201
Whenever you’d like to
make your way to the table

14:28.243 --> 14:30.704
and get ready for lunch.

14:30.745 --> 14:34.457
Anything that can float is
going on that ----ing water.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.252
<i>Ellie, Ellie, Tasha.</i>

14:37.293 --> 14:39.004
<i>Please, can you come up</i>
<i>to the main pantry?</i>

14:39.045 --> 14:41.423
We just need your help
for lunch service.

14:41.464 --> 14:42.424
<i>Copy that.</i>

14:44.217 --> 14:46.970
So, Dave, I think the guests
are making their way up now.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.597
Yeah, I’m ready to go.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.683
There was a point in the
season where I was, like,

14:51.725 --> 14:55.103
I’ve had enough, I can’t handle
this emotionally and mentally,

14:55.145 --> 14:56.604
because of Tash.

14:56.646 --> 14:59.232
But at the end of the day,
I’m here to do a job

14:59.274 --> 15:01.901
and I wanna make sure
I get it done well.

15:01.943 --> 15:05.780
So, now it’s time to just go
full, like, tunnel vision...

15:05.822 --> 15:07.115
one focus.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.616
I’m coming for you.

15:08.658 --> 15:09.951
Let’s go.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.327
I’ll be right with you,

15:11.369 --> 15:13.038
we’re just gonna do drinks
and stuff first.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.164
What do you call this?

15:14.205 --> 15:16.124
[chattering]

15:16.166 --> 15:17.417
No, you do not like
fancy enough for this.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.252
Yeah, for my bathing suit.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.296
So, Nat just needs
a hand upstairs.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.423
If you can, please, just
pour waters for them.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.885
Look at the ----ing view.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.178
Malta’s a pretty cool place.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.055
Okay, that is salmon.

15:36.186 --> 15:39.022
Three, two...

15:39.064 --> 15:40.273
Would you like some still water?

15:40.315 --> 15:42.400
-Yeah.
-Sparkling?

15:42.442 --> 15:43.443
Sure.

15:43.485 --> 15:44.569
Oh, wow.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.196
Any more to go up, Dave?

15:46.237 --> 15:49.991
-Sweet potato?
-Smoked sweet potato, yeah.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.034
What is this?

15:51.076 --> 15:52.494
So, we’ve got sweet potato.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.954
-Wow, that looks great.
-You can smell the smoke.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.331
There’s just one more thing.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.624
I’ll run it up
and I’ll come explain.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.708
Oh, perfect.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.421
Natasha, we’ve got
a nice lamb kofta there.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.675
We’ve got some grilled salmon
with some pickled courgette,

16:06.716 --> 16:09.469
some smoked sweet
potato there, mixed tomato

16:09.511 --> 16:11.513
and black bean salad there,
just a little bit of texture.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.681
Thank you.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.973
-Yeah, this sh--’s nice.
-Thanks, guys.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.558
Mm.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.018
-Oh, the sweet potato’s good.
-That was really good.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.312
I just really wanna say
I appreciate it,

16:19.354 --> 16:22.691
I appreciate the moment to
really bask in it with you guys.

16:22.732 --> 16:23.692
-Thank you.
-Oh.

16:23.733 --> 16:24.734
Thanks, sweetie.

16:24.776 --> 16:25.735
That brought a tear to my eye.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.320
Oh!

16:30.407 --> 16:33.243
My ex reached out to me
basically saying

16:33.284 --> 16:35.286
he wants to get
back together again.

16:35.328 --> 16:40.542
I always feel sick about
the thought of being alone,

16:40.583 --> 16:43.169
but all I can feel is
the way he looked at me

16:43.211 --> 16:45.338
when he told me to [bleep] off.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.720
Literally, like,
he wanted me to die.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.184
Boy, that lamb looks good.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.227
Mm, it’s really good.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.395
-What you want?
-Just hand me...

17:00.437 --> 17:01.438
you can use your hands.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.106
Yeah, you can just toss me it.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.568
<i>Tash, going well</i>
<i>with the table?</i>

17:06.609 --> 17:08.903
Hey, can you please
stop messaging me?

17:08.945 --> 17:09.988
I don’t need this right now.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.281
I’m trying to...

17:11.322 --> 17:13.700
I’m trying to do my
last charter.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.998
It’s all right.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.332
Okay.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.293
You do you, Natasha.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.258
Here you go.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.718
Are you about to take
out the jet-skis?

17:31.760 --> 17:32.719
Yeah, yeah.

17:32.761 --> 17:33.970
Where’s D?

17:34.012 --> 17:35.305
-He hasn’t slept in--
-[crash]

17:35.347 --> 17:38.475
Oh, my God, did you just...

17:38.516 --> 17:41.102
I’m good, I’m good, I’m good.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.312
-Oh, that was not good.
-Oh, my God.

17:42.354 --> 17:43.313
She just clocked something.

17:43.355 --> 17:46.274
Oh, my God.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.776
I did that when I was little...

17:47.817 --> 17:49.444
I ran into a screen door

17:49.486 --> 17:50.779
and my dad thought
it was hilarious.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.490
-I did.
-You okay, Ellie?

17:57.160 --> 17:58.495
Can I grab one of
the WaveRunners

17:58.536 --> 17:59.704
and just take it out for
a few minutes?

17:59.746 --> 18:01.331
Of course you can.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.124
I’m sorry, I don’t have that
much experience in service.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.043
I do love to learn, though, so
I’m about learning, but...

18:05.085 --> 18:06.753
No, honestly, you’ve
been incredible.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.338
Thank you so much.

18:08.380 --> 18:11.549
Just press the red button and
you can get on and out of here.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.176
Enjoy!

18:14.344 --> 18:16.137
[text chimes]

18:16.179 --> 18:19.557
Oh, I was wondering, how do you
tell people’s laundry apart,

18:19.599 --> 18:21.976
because it’s not
really labeled, per se.

18:22.018 --> 18:22.977
Oh, I know.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.396
So, where...

18:24.437 --> 18:25.814
I’ll have to ask Nat
what she normally does.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.190
Okay.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.278
You’re strong.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.453
[text chimes]

18:40.495 --> 18:42.330
Actually, I’ll be back
in just one moment.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.832
Pretty awesome, right?

18:43.873 --> 18:45.792
So awesome.

19:01.349 --> 19:04.519
None of this is okay.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.229
I am so fed up with
dealing with this now.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.709
Do you use distilled water
for this, or regular water?

19:28.752 --> 19:30.587
-Bottled water.
-Bottled water?

19:30.628 --> 19:32.047
Enjoy.

19:33.298 --> 19:35.467
Good job!

19:35.508 --> 19:38.303
For tonight, like,
activities tonight...

19:38.345 --> 19:39.721
Yeah?

19:39.763 --> 19:40.722
Do we have a theme
we’re doing tonight?

19:40.764 --> 19:42.140
Tonight we thought casino.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.767
-It is, so it’s Vegas, okay.
-Yeah, Vegas.

19:43.808 --> 19:44.976
Just so I can tell
everyone to dress for Vegas.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.770
Vegas. Lovely.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.021
I’m about to have a conversation
with you, big fella.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.397
Yeah?

19:49.439 --> 19:50.440
Me personally, I would
like some pancakes.

19:50.482 --> 19:51.775
-For dinner?
-Yeah.

19:51.816 --> 19:54.778
I like it crispy
around the edges, though.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.279
-Yeah, okay.
-Not too fluffy.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.739
No worries, I can do that.

19:57.781 --> 19:59.616
A question...
do y’all have coconut oil?

19:59.657 --> 20:01.076
-We do, yes.
-Ooh, okay.

20:01.117 --> 20:02.285
Do you want me to do
it in coconut oil?

20:02.327 --> 20:03.286
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

20:03.328 --> 20:04.287
Is that all right?

20:04.329 --> 20:05.747
Yeah, so, usually, obviously,

20:05.789 --> 20:06.956
you can do it whatever
way you do it...

20:06.998 --> 20:09.209
just take, like,
a nice little glop,

20:09.250 --> 20:13.380
put it right in the center as
I’m dripping the batter in.

20:13.421 --> 20:14.839
Yeah, okay.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.508
You know what I mean, so it
can just spread it out.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.134
Do you want it small,
or do you want it big?

20:18.176 --> 20:19.344
Big, big, yeah.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.595
Big... yeah, that’s fine.

20:20.637 --> 20:21.805
I’ll give it a go,
and then you...

20:21.846 --> 20:22.806
Perfect.

20:22.847 --> 20:23.932
Can see if I got
everything right.

20:27.602 --> 20:30.188
I’m really happy you could
join us, thank you.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.606
Thank you, I appreciate it.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.608
So, you’ve worked in
spas, and...

20:33.650 --> 20:35.276
-Yes.
-Yeah.

20:35.318 --> 20:36.403
Where did you sail to?

20:36.444 --> 20:38.822
We sailed all over.

20:38.863 --> 20:42.701
I get a lot of the Caribbean,
a lot of South America as well.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.495
So, you’re in some rough seas.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.789
Oh... yeah.

20:47.831 --> 20:51.835
A couple of years ago,
we lost engine power

20:51.876 --> 20:57.007
in a storm in Norway
in this spot that’s,

20:57.048 --> 20:58.925
like, historically known
for shipwrecks.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.678
It’s, like, the worst spot
you could possibly

21:01.720 --> 21:03.888
lose control over the vessel.

21:03.930 --> 21:08.101
So, yeah, I’m lucky
to be alive right now.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.478
It was a life-changing
experience, you know?

21:10.520 --> 21:12.147
Did you have to launch
the life rafts?

21:12.188 --> 21:14.149
We couldn’t, because
the weather was so bad.

21:14.190 --> 21:17.736
Like, the waves were,
like, from 10 to 20 meter.

21:17.777 --> 21:22.365
I felt like, you know, I had
a near-death experience there.

21:22.407 --> 21:26.036
It was really hard
thinking of my parents.

21:26.077 --> 21:31.207
I’m their only child, so my
heart broke for my parents.

21:31.249 --> 21:35.337
It wasn’t even so much
for me and my life.

21:35.378 --> 21:39.215
Just thinking of the pain
it would cause my parents

21:39.257 --> 21:41.718
was so heartbreaking.

21:43.261 --> 21:46.431
We had, like,
helicopters evacuating us,

21:46.473 --> 21:50.643
and it was, like,
a 27-hour mission.

21:50.685 --> 21:54.230
That’s terrible,
just flailing in the sea.

21:54.272 --> 21:57.067
Pretty much, yeah.

21:57.108 --> 22:01.321
* Second-to-last dinner
Second-to-last dinner *

22:01.363 --> 22:03.907
You’re so excited, I love it.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.784
Ah, where do I start,
where do I start?

22:05.825 --> 22:07.869
Oh, wow.

22:07.911 --> 22:10.622
Boys’ outfits tonight, yee!

22:15.877 --> 22:17.420
Do you wanna go on the tube?

22:17.462 --> 22:20.340
I could take you on the red one
behind the ski, do you wanna go?

22:20.382 --> 22:21.758
All right.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.761
Just him and the Mediterranean.

22:24.803 --> 22:28.765
Dinner... right, what are
we having tonight

22:28.807 --> 22:30.266
for dinner for the guests?

22:30.308 --> 22:31.518
Are you all right?

22:33.478 --> 22:35.522
So, I’m doing a
lobster surf-and-turf...

22:35.563 --> 22:36.731
Yeah?

22:36.773 --> 22:38.108
With short rib and lobster.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.320
Yeah?

22:42.362 --> 22:43.697
So...

22:43.738 --> 22:45.448
He mentioned earlier
he could eat pancakes

22:45.490 --> 22:47.701
for breakfast, lunch,
and dinner.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.494
And that’s what he wants.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.292
Oh, my.

22:56.334 --> 22:57.794
Dude, that’s sh-- that
we live for right there, boy.

22:57.836 --> 22:59.546
-It is.
-That sh-- is fire.

23:04.342 --> 23:05.343
-Oh, there you go!
-Ooh!

23:05.385 --> 23:07.303
Oh, that was up in the air!

23:07.345 --> 23:09.389
Oh! Oh! Oh!

23:09.431 --> 23:11.224
Good job!

23:11.266 --> 23:13.184
[bleep]

23:15.228 --> 23:17.188
Come on, I’ll do it.
Hey, I’m gonna do that sh--.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.690
-Yeah.
-Yeah, one time.

23:19.899 --> 23:23.069
Okay, what am I doing,
what am I doing?

23:23.111 --> 23:25.280
Woo!

23:27.699 --> 23:31.036
-Oh!
-Ooh!

23:34.289 --> 23:36.541
-Oh, you did?
-Yeah.

23:37.667 --> 23:38.793
Are you all right?

23:44.507 --> 23:45.925
Damn.

23:47.886 --> 23:49.804
My little confettis.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.184
Sh--.

23:54.225 --> 23:56.478
I always wear that mother----er.
I never take it off.

23:56.519 --> 23:58.646
I’m gonna go look
for my sh--.

23:58.688 --> 23:59.647
Where... where you... when?

23:59.689 --> 24:00.940
What... which one?

24:00.982 --> 24:02.192
I think it was that last
spill that got me,

24:02.233 --> 24:05.278
so I lost it in the
Mediterranean.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.738
Sure.

24:06.780 --> 24:07.822
Can we get it tomorrow,
first thing in the morning?

24:07.864 --> 24:09.074
Who would wanna dive?

24:11.242 --> 24:13.036
Oh sh--.
Oh, that’s why you wanna dive.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.621
-Yeah.
-[bleep]

24:16.998 --> 24:18.958
Let me see if we can
possibly dive, like,

24:19.000 --> 24:20.669
first thing in the morning,
or, like, this...

24:20.710 --> 24:22.128
if somebody could come.

24:22.170 --> 24:23.546
-I’ll go speak to Captain.
-Okay.

24:23.588 --> 24:24.923
-Just bear with me.
-Oh, thanks.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.257
-All right, thank you.
-Dave, Dave, Nat.

24:26.299 --> 24:27.842
Captain Sandy, Captain Sandy,
Courtney.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.386
It’s very hard to say
no to guests.

24:29.427 --> 24:30.637
Like, I hate it.

24:30.679 --> 24:32.764
But we’re in a bay, basically,

24:32.806 --> 24:34.933
and the current’s going
out of this bay.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.143
So, even if you wanted to
dive down and get it,

24:37.185 --> 24:39.020
somebody would have
to dive 40 meters,

24:39.062 --> 24:42.315
which there would still
be no possibility

24:42.357 --> 24:43.733
of finding this chain.

24:43.775 --> 24:45.777
I can see him, like,
stressing the [bleep] out.

24:57.706 --> 24:58.998
So, the guy went tubing
with his big, gold chain on...

25:01.626 --> 25:04.879
-And he lost it?
-And he’s lost it.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.214
They’re just wondering if,
like,

25:06.256 --> 25:08.299
there’s any, like,
diving facilities

25:08.341 --> 25:10.677
where they could dive down
in the water tomorrow morning

25:10.719 --> 25:12.095
and try and find it.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.766
How deep is it, 14 meters.
Sh--.

25:16.808 --> 25:20.478
And it’s probably deeper where
you were taking him on the tube.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.813
I’m in a shallow spot.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.356
That necklace is a needle
in a haystack.

25:23.398 --> 25:25.650
I would say this...
did he have insurance?

25:25.692 --> 25:26.943
I think I’d make a claim.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.945
-It’s gone.
-Yeah.

25:28.987 --> 25:30.822
Okay, I’ll go and tell them.
Okay, thanks, Cap.

25:30.864 --> 25:33.158
-That was a good job today.
-Thanks.

25:35.035 --> 25:37.954
Yes, look at this!
Thank you.

25:37.996 --> 25:40.290
I’m just, like, I haven’t
decided, like randomly.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.334
My process is I put
everything on the table

25:42.375 --> 25:44.169
and then I eliminate
all the rubbish.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.338
-No, I’m the same.
-The boys are gonna set up.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.505
Okay, fab, oh!

25:47.547 --> 25:48.840
Run up those napkins.

25:48.882 --> 25:49.841
I should do my dinner jacket
fold again.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.343
-Yeah, do that.
-Yeah.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.261
-Sexual.
-Yeah.

25:53.303 --> 25:55.013
I feel like losing Kyle

25:55.055 --> 25:57.349
has brought me and
Natalya closer together.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.017
I’m actually
really surprised.

25:59.059 --> 26:02.479
So, it’s nice to actually
spend time with her.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.147
I’m gonna get changed
when I finish...

26:04.189 --> 26:05.440
-Yeah.
-because I’m gonna get in my...

26:05.482 --> 26:06.775
one of those.

26:06.816 --> 26:08.193
All right,
so you’re half a day in.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.779
I walked through a glass door
in front of the guests.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.864
-No, you didn’t.
-Yeah, I did.

26:12.906 --> 26:14.199
So, how long have you been
in yachting?

26:14.240 --> 26:15.867
I’ve been in yachting
since last June.

26:15.909 --> 26:17.911
My first boat was Kismet,
so I...

26:17.952 --> 26:19.704
-Mm-hmm.
-...worked on, like, a 95-meter.

26:19.746 --> 26:20.872
Yeah, I know Kizzy.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.540
Oh, yeah?

26:22.582 --> 26:25.377
Most of my friends describe
me as pretty flirty.

26:25.418 --> 26:26.711
I don’t try to be.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.171
So, you said you’re from?

26:28.213 --> 26:30.548
I’m a Southern boy
through-and-through.

26:30.590 --> 26:31.966
Is that flirty?

26:32.008 --> 26:35.220
Maybe, but really,
it’s just the truth.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.722
Ooh, you know
what song I like?

26:37.764 --> 26:40.517
"Tennessee Whiskey."

26:40.558 --> 26:41.893
Yes, I love that one.

26:41.935 --> 26:43.228
I think we’re gonna get
along really well.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.437
Thanks.

26:44.479 --> 26:45.814
-What would you do?
-Do we have good news?

26:45.855 --> 26:47.399
-Mm.
-We have bad news.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.068
Well, obviously, you were
tubing, like, all around there,

26:50.110 --> 26:51.569
and it only gets
deeper from here.

26:51.611 --> 26:53.071
It’s, like...

26:53.113 --> 26:54.989
And this current is probably
the strongest current

26:55.031 --> 26:57.659
that we’ve had,
like, all season.

26:57.701 --> 26:59.035
Probably is already going
that way.

26:59.077 --> 27:00.412
-[bleep]
-I know, I’m sorry...

27:00.453 --> 27:02.539
this is not the news
that you want to hear.

27:02.580 --> 27:03.707
I understand the seriousness.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.500
No, of course...
okay, cool, yeah.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.252
Yeah, that’s all we
can kinda do at the moment.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.336
Yeah.

27:08.378 --> 27:09.754
You did what you can,
life happens.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.381
The chain...
that’s long gone.

27:11.423 --> 27:15.719
It’s in Spain, honey,
it’s not in Malta anymore.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.555
I don’t actually know where
Spain is in comparison to Malta.

27:23.893 --> 27:24.978
I don’t know.

27:25.020 --> 27:26.312
Sorry, man.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.939
Life happens, you lose
six-figure chains.

27:27.981 --> 27:28.982
[laughing]

27:29.024 --> 27:31.443
So, tonight is James Bond?

27:31.484 --> 27:32.777
Yeah.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.779
I actually happen
to have a costume on me.

27:34.821 --> 27:36.448
Okay.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.783
But I don’t know if it’s
gonna fit the theme at all.

27:38.825 --> 27:39.993
What is it?

27:40.035 --> 27:42.454
It’s a Playboy Bunny costume.

27:42.495 --> 27:46.166
Like, if you feel comfortable
to do that, then bring it on.

27:46.207 --> 27:47.584
Yeah.

27:47.625 --> 27:50.128
On my previous boat we had
a lot of costume parties,

27:50.170 --> 27:52.297
and I dressed up
as a Playboy Bunny.

27:52.339 --> 27:54.841
It kind of became,
like, my theme, you know,

27:54.883 --> 27:56.509
what everybody knew me for.

27:56.551 --> 27:59.387
Ever since then, I’ve been
bringing all my costumes along.

27:59.429 --> 28:02.432
I’ve got my slutty cheerleader,
that’s another staple of mine.

28:02.474 --> 28:05.643
But yeah, there is not
enough time on this boat

28:05.685 --> 28:07.520
to bring the other personas.

28:07.562 --> 28:09.814
We’re just going with
the bunny for now.

28:09.856 --> 28:13.234
<i>All crew, all crew, we’re gonna</i>
<i>be putting in all the toys.</i>

28:13.276 --> 28:16.029
<i>Everyone’s doing</i>
<i>a great job so far.</i>

28:26.122 --> 28:27.415
So, it’s a Vegas night.

28:27.457 --> 28:28.958
-Casino night?
-Casino night.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.001
I’m gonna go take a shower.

28:30.043 --> 28:31.670
I’m gonna go get ready.

28:31.711 --> 28:34.047
Interior, Court. What time is
everything starting tonight?

28:37.801 --> 28:39.177
Okay.

28:39.219 --> 28:41.554
Boys?
Dinnertime.

28:41.596 --> 28:43.431
Hey. Boys?

28:43.473 --> 28:44.683
Hey.

28:44.724 --> 28:46.184
Gotta get up and shower.

28:46.226 --> 28:48.019
All right, I’m so excited
to see your outfits.

28:48.061 --> 28:50.355
Yeah, it’s gonna be fun!

28:53.858 --> 28:54.901
Oh, my God.

28:54.943 --> 28:57.987
What the hell is this dress?

28:58.029 --> 29:00.240
Let me see?
Oh, wow.

29:00.281 --> 29:01.783
Oh, wow.

29:01.825 --> 29:03.201
Welcome to Vegas.

29:03.243 --> 29:05.995
This is disgusting.

29:06.037 --> 29:07.789
-Splashy.
-"Splashy!"

29:07.831 --> 29:09.040
Splashy!

29:09.082 --> 29:10.917
I’m jel, I wanna be
a Playboy Bunny.

29:10.959 --> 29:12.293
I’ve actually got two costumes.

29:12.335 --> 29:13.378
No way!

29:14.713 --> 29:16.047
Oh, my God, that’s so hot.

29:16.089 --> 29:19.050
Oh, my God, so cute!

29:21.720 --> 29:23.930
Okay, I feel like...

29:23.972 --> 29:27.350
Oh, my God!

29:27.392 --> 29:29.060
I think it’s a bit much
to be honest.

29:29.102 --> 29:31.354
I can die a happy man now.

29:33.106 --> 29:35.734
Thankfully, Courtney and
I both have skirts

29:35.775 --> 29:39.195
to make it a little bit more
presentable to the guests.

29:39.237 --> 29:42.615
We’re working for tips,
but not that kind of tips.

29:44.701 --> 29:46.286
I feel like a ----ing idiot.

29:49.789 --> 29:50.874
Let me see...

29:50.915 --> 29:52.250
I’m a porn director in the ’70s,

29:52.292 --> 29:55.211
but I’m also the fluffer
and the lead actor.

29:55.253 --> 29:56.588
And the director.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.089
The three of you again
doing anchor watch.

29:58.131 --> 29:59.507
I will be going to bed.

29:59.549 --> 30:00.842
-You know your time, eh?
-Two, correct?

30:00.884 --> 30:02.052
Thanks, mate.

30:02.093 --> 30:03.720
Help me...
do you have a minute?

30:03.762 --> 30:04.804
Of course I do.

30:04.846 --> 30:05.930
Can you cut my tail off, please?

30:05.972 --> 30:09.601
-Cut your tail off.
-Yeah.

30:09.642 --> 30:10.852
Roll Tide.

30:10.894 --> 30:14.272
Oh, my goodness... rawr.

30:14.314 --> 30:15.273
Ooh!

30:15.315 --> 30:18.318
-Good night, ladies.
-Good night!

30:19.319 --> 30:21.112
You look like a fortune teller.

30:21.154 --> 30:23.448
Oh, my God, Blackjack.

30:23.490 --> 30:24.699
Blackjack.

30:24.741 --> 30:25.909
-Isn’t it cute, what they did?
-So cute.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.535
Woo!

30:29.704 --> 30:31.122
That’s amazing!

30:31.164 --> 30:33.333
So, Vegas versus
Playboy Bunnies?

30:33.375 --> 30:34.793
Well, we just thought,
you know, like,

30:34.834 --> 30:36.044
cocktail waitresses in Vegas.

30:36.086 --> 30:39.547
-Yeah, I love it.
-Oh, I like that.

30:39.589 --> 30:41.174
This is the best.

30:41.216 --> 30:42.509
Would you like still
or sparkling water?

30:42.550 --> 30:44.052
Still would be great,
thank you so much.

30:44.094 --> 30:45.095
Still?

30:45.136 --> 30:46.471
Wonderful outfits.

30:46.513 --> 30:47.263
Mm-hmm.

30:47.305 --> 30:49.099
This is for the pancakes.

30:49.140 --> 30:53.061
If someone asks for a thin
pancake, I’m gonna make a crepe.

30:53.103 --> 30:55.855
Super airy, super light,
crispy on the outside.

30:55.897 --> 30:57.357
I’ve even got a blowtorch,

30:57.399 --> 30:59.234
just to make it really
crispy on the outside.

30:59.275 --> 31:01.069
I’m just gonna go up
with the bread.

31:01.111 --> 31:02.153
All right,
how about a toast now?

31:02.195 --> 31:03.780
Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust

31:03.822 --> 31:06.157
[bleep] ain’t pizza,
so don’t eat the crust.

31:07.158 --> 31:08.076
Damn.

31:08.118 --> 31:09.327
Where did you hear these from?

31:09.369 --> 31:10.662
A drag queen friend.

31:10.704 --> 31:11.913
-Okay.
-Yeah.

31:11.955 --> 31:13.456
Freshly baked bread.

31:13.498 --> 31:15.834
There you go, love.
Hopefully he likes them.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.252
-Thank you.
-Ta-da!

31:17.293 --> 31:19.337
All I know is I want
the butter

31:19.379 --> 31:21.256
that’s on the other side,
and the salt.

31:22.424 --> 31:24.592
This is the pancake request.

31:24.634 --> 31:26.803
Pancake, yes, yes.

31:26.845 --> 31:28.513
Oh, my God.

31:28.555 --> 31:30.890
Thin, crispy-ass pancakes
right there.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.809
-Oh!
-Wow.

31:32.851 --> 31:34.144
Are those the pancakes?

31:34.185 --> 31:37.272
Well, that’s what
you wanted, right?

31:37.313 --> 31:38.857
They’re French.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.859
If you stack them all together,
it’s like a pancake.

31:40.900 --> 31:44.779
You really want a pancake?
He’ll make you pancakes.

31:44.821 --> 31:46.740
So, you asked for crepes,
but you...

31:46.781 --> 31:47.949
-No, I did not ask for crepes.
-No, he did not ask for crepes.

31:47.991 --> 31:49.200
I specifically said "pancakes."

31:49.242 --> 31:50.952
-Did you say that to him?
-Yeah.

31:50.994 --> 31:52.412
I’m gonna get pancakes.

31:52.454 --> 31:53.997
I know I did not say crepes.

31:54.039 --> 31:56.291
-You said pancakes.
-I’m not eating that sh--.

31:56.332 --> 31:57.709
I’m not eating that.

31:57.751 --> 31:59.336
I don’t want it.

32:08.178 --> 32:09.971
-I’m not a crepe person.
-Oh, okay.

32:10.013 --> 32:14.851
Chef, he doesn’t want crepes,
he wants pancakes.

32:14.893 --> 32:16.353
No, he doesn’t.

32:16.394 --> 32:17.854
He wants the opposite
to American pancakes.

32:17.896 --> 32:20.398
No, I’m telling you
right now, he goes...

32:20.440 --> 32:22.359
he doesn’t...
he wants a pancake.

32:24.152 --> 32:28.740
I was told that he doesn’t
like American-style pancakes.

32:28.782 --> 32:32.786
I was told that he wants thin,
crispy on the outside.

32:32.827 --> 32:34.704
-I would like some pancakes.
-For dinner?

32:34.746 --> 32:35.872
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

32:35.914 --> 32:38.667
I like it crispy
around the edges, though.

32:38.708 --> 32:40.418
-Yeah, okay.
-And not too fluffy.

32:40.460 --> 32:44.381
So, I sent him up a
----ing thin pancake.

32:44.422 --> 32:45.882
He doesn’t look very happy.

32:45.924 --> 32:48.176
-You upset?
-No, I’m not upset.

32:49.678 --> 32:52.639
We had this massive conversation
about thin, crispy ones.

32:52.681 --> 32:54.349
Sorry, David.

32:54.391 --> 32:56.643
I said ----ing pancakes.
That’s the sh-- I wanted.

32:56.685 --> 32:58.353
I just wanted some
Goddamn ----ing pancakes

32:58.395 --> 33:01.022
that were crispy.

33:01.064 --> 33:03.108
You’re saying you’re a
pancake-eating mother----er.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.526
I got that.

33:04.567 --> 33:07.153
Yeah, crispy-edge
pancake-eating mother----er.

33:07.195 --> 33:08.822
I’m gonna go to bed.

33:08.863 --> 33:10.490
Good night, thank
you for appearing.

33:10.532 --> 33:11.533
Ouchie.

33:14.327 --> 33:15.954
Okay, we’re ready on dinner.

33:18.081 --> 33:19.833
-Hi.
-Hi.

33:19.874 --> 33:21.584
-Hello, hello.
-Oh, look at these costumes.

33:21.626 --> 33:23.003
Hello!

33:23.044 --> 33:25.005
On the base we’ve got
celeriac and vanilla puree,

33:25.046 --> 33:26.506
got some char-grilled asparagus,

33:26.548 --> 33:28.008
and then we’ve just
got some grilled sea bass.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.009
Ooh.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.343
My favorite.

33:30.385 --> 33:31.428
And then I got
the pancakes wrong, so...

33:31.469 --> 33:33.013
No, no, you’re good, man.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.181
You didn’t get them wrong,
you just made crepes.

33:35.223 --> 33:37.684
I’m a very difficult person...

33:37.726 --> 33:39.102
I wanna get it right, though,
I wanna get it right.

33:39.144 --> 33:41.271
-I got you.
-So, thicker than that.

33:41.312 --> 33:42.856
Yeah, yeah, like,
a little bit thicker.

33:42.897 --> 33:44.190
-A little bit thicker, oh.
-Yeah, yeah, a little thicker.

33:44.232 --> 33:45.567
Stop this sh--.

33:45.608 --> 33:47.152
Does she know she does
have to do turn-downs?

33:47.193 --> 33:48.194
Do you wanna
just give her a hand?

33:48.236 --> 33:49.195
-Yeah.
-So, in-between...

33:49.237 --> 33:51.239
A crepe and a pancake.

33:51.281 --> 33:52.574
All right, just
give me two minutes.

33:53.658 --> 33:54.534
Wow.

33:54.576 --> 33:55.702
This sea bass
is really good.

33:55.744 --> 33:56.953
Yes.

33:56.995 --> 33:58.788
Oh, you like flipping
pancakes... here you go.

33:58.830 --> 34:00.081
Flip it...

34:00.123 --> 34:01.458
no pressure, if you get
it wrong, I’m ----ed.

34:01.499 --> 34:03.710
It’s a big pancake to...

34:03.752 --> 34:04.836
Oh [bleep].

34:04.878 --> 34:06.755
You do it.

34:08.590 --> 34:10.008
Lovely, you’re so neat!

34:10.050 --> 34:11.343
Ellie seems switched on,

34:11.384 --> 34:13.053
like she understands
the laundry system.

34:13.094 --> 34:15.055
She’s doing really well, which
I’m super surprised about.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.265
I’m gonna jump in the cabins
with you and come back for...

34:17.307 --> 34:18.767
Yes.

34:20.477 --> 34:23.897
We got the dice, I’m trying
to take somebody’s money now.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.273
Thank you.

34:27.692 --> 34:29.361
Is it like this thickness,
would you say?

34:29.402 --> 34:30.862
-Oh...
-Yeah.

34:30.904 --> 34:32.447
That’s a little
bit better, right?

34:32.489 --> 34:35.575
No... no, you...
you’ve gotta be honest, come on.

34:35.617 --> 34:37.118
We need to nail this pancake.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.328
-I’m gonna eat it.
-Yeah?

34:38.370 --> 34:39.746
Yeah, I’m gonna eat it.

34:39.788 --> 34:41.289
Yeah, I just gotta teach
y’all, that’s all.

34:41.331 --> 34:42.791
-Okay.
-It’s just a little technique.

34:42.832 --> 34:47.253
Yeah, you must show us.
I’m really intrigued.

34:47.295 --> 34:48.254
Have you finished
this double?

34:48.296 --> 34:49.756
Yeah, I think so.

34:49.798 --> 34:51.049
All right, we’ll pop it in
the cleaning cupboard.

34:51.091 --> 34:52.342
He’s eating it.

34:52.384 --> 34:54.260
Oh, he’s... oh, no.

34:54.302 --> 34:55.720
Oh, no, no.

34:55.762 --> 34:58.390
Eat your pancake,
your thinly sliced pancake.

35:00.558 --> 35:01.768
<i>Service in the galley, please.</i>

35:01.810 --> 35:03.770
I’m gonna go serve
the next course,

35:03.812 --> 35:05.855
and then I will
jump into master.

35:05.897 --> 35:08.900
Okay.

35:08.942 --> 35:09.859
All right.

35:11.986 --> 35:13.029
Hello, everybody.

35:13.071 --> 35:14.656
Davey, what are
we talking about here?

35:14.698 --> 35:16.658
Grilled surf-and-turf.
This is a lobster bisque.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.326
We’ve got a
butternut squash puree,

35:18.368 --> 35:20.787
a 14-hour slow-roast
short rib.

35:20.829 --> 35:23.623
-Enjoy, guys.
-Beautifully presented.

35:23.665 --> 35:25.542
Wow.

35:25.583 --> 35:27.043
The lobster is good, though.

35:27.085 --> 35:29.671
The hair on the floor.
Sayonara, friend.

35:32.090 --> 35:34.009
Yay, cabin done.

35:34.050 --> 35:35.468
Nicely done, girl.

35:35.510 --> 35:36.720
You should have seen me
in the master floor,

35:36.761 --> 35:38.096
-I was like ----ing.
-Getting down?

35:38.138 --> 35:40.056
Somebody come here.

35:41.683 --> 35:43.476
Storm, settle down!

35:43.518 --> 35:46.021
How am I supposed to
settle down, look at you!

35:46.062 --> 35:47.147
Thank you so much.

35:47.188 --> 35:48.106
You’re welcome.

35:50.692 --> 35:52.193
What?

35:52.235 --> 35:55.363
No, but I can snort a noodle
and make it go out my throat.

35:55.405 --> 35:57.949
That’s... we stop there.

35:57.991 --> 36:00.618
I gotta see this sh--.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.789
It has to be a spaghetti noodle.

36:04.831 --> 36:05.999
Got you.

36:06.041 --> 36:07.334
A floppy spaghetti noodle.

36:07.375 --> 36:09.627
-I have a request.
-Ooh, hello!

36:09.669 --> 36:12.797
So, somebody said that they
can snort a noodle

36:12.839 --> 36:14.424
up they nose and make it
come out their mouth.

36:14.466 --> 36:16.509
-So, like, a spaghetti noodle.
-Yeah, like a spaghetti noodle.

36:16.551 --> 36:18.261
-No way!
-Do you have a spaghetti noodle?

36:18.303 --> 36:19.429
We’d have to cook it, surely?

36:19.471 --> 36:20.555
Yeah.

36:20.597 --> 36:23.016
I would like to watch.

36:23.058 --> 36:26.519
Of course, the pancake guy
who is ----ing pissed off

36:26.561 --> 36:29.564
with his pancakes
wants something else.

36:29.606 --> 36:30.815
They’re gonna cook
up the noodles

36:30.857 --> 36:32.025
and they’re gonna
bring up the...

36:32.067 --> 36:34.694
-You’re lying.
-I promise you!

36:34.736 --> 36:36.154
-Dave?
-Yeah.

36:36.196 --> 36:38.448
Just let me know when
that spaghetti’s ready.

36:38.490 --> 36:39.991
Let’s play Blackjack.

36:42.994 --> 36:44.662
Hi, are you looking
for your drink?

36:44.704 --> 36:49.000
No, I’m looking for, like,
a place to lie down.

36:49.042 --> 36:49.876
Here.

36:49.918 --> 36:51.419
Mook, you can’t go to sleep.

36:51.461 --> 36:53.171
Where’s that noodle at, man?

36:53.213 --> 36:56.091
[laughing]

36:56.132 --> 36:57.217
Spaghetti.

36:57.258 --> 36:58.426
You wanna take it up to him?

36:58.468 --> 36:59.969
No, he wants to do
a party trick.

37:00.011 --> 37:02.263
So, he wants to put spaghetti
up his nose, and Q-Tips.

37:02.305 --> 37:03.723
-Let me put this on the...
-The big boys have gone down.

37:03.765 --> 37:05.725
-Here you go.
-I reckon I can do it.

37:05.767 --> 37:08.687
Okay.

37:08.728 --> 37:09.896
I can’t do it!

37:09.938 --> 37:11.147
Ah!

37:11.189 --> 37:14.693
You do have, like, some
solid nostrils there.

37:14.734 --> 37:15.944
You’ve gotta snarf it in.

37:18.113 --> 37:20.198
Oh, my God!

37:20.240 --> 37:21.574
Can I get video of this?

37:21.616 --> 37:23.201
This is so gross.

37:26.162 --> 37:28.039
-Can you cover my feet, too?
-Feet in there?

37:28.081 --> 37:30.250
Well, guys, I believe someone
ordered spaghetti and Q-Tips.

37:30.291 --> 37:31.584
Noodles, yes!

37:31.626 --> 37:32.919
-Spaghetti and Q-Tips!
-Who’s it for?

37:32.961 --> 37:34.212
Him!

37:34.254 --> 37:37.424
It’s stuck, I can’t
get it any further!

37:37.465 --> 37:40.719
I can’t get it...

37:40.760 --> 37:44.764
I’m gonna snort it and
then pull it out my... hold on.

37:50.270 --> 37:52.355
Oh sh--!

37:52.397 --> 37:53.481
[bleep]

37:53.523 --> 37:55.525
-Yay!
-[bleep]

37:59.237 --> 38:00.905
[bleep]

38:00.947 --> 38:01.865
Coming up...

38:05.285 --> 38:06.411
He’s calling me a bully.

38:06.453 --> 38:07.495
He said that?

38:07.537 --> 38:08.580
That’s what your boyfriend said.

38:08.621 --> 38:10.165
It’s a load of rubbish.

38:10.206 --> 38:11.458
So, what... how would you want
me to deal with this situation?

38:11.499 --> 38:12.584
I don’t, I want you to know.

38:21.134 --> 38:22.135
Would anyone like a
porn star martini?

38:23.845 --> 38:25.347
Is this carrot juice and...

38:25.388 --> 38:27.432
So, this is champagne and
this is porn star martini.

38:27.474 --> 38:28.933
No, she’s doubling down.

38:28.975 --> 38:30.935
You’re doing a lot of math
in your head right now?

38:32.479 --> 38:34.022
Thank you for tonight.

38:34.064 --> 38:36.024
-Nice, baby.
-Oh, 21, look at that.

38:36.066 --> 38:37.442
Yes!

38:37.484 --> 38:39.277
Mook, come on, let’s go,
speed it up a little bit.

38:39.319 --> 38:41.905
The slowest dealer...

38:46.743 --> 38:47.994
Ready to go?

38:48.036 --> 38:49.204
Yeah, I was about
to head up too.

38:49.245 --> 38:50.372
Let’s go.

38:50.413 --> 38:51.873
Okay, let me know what
you want me to do.

38:51.915 --> 38:53.541
The pantries, the dining room
needs doing.

38:53.583 --> 38:54.709
Then I’m gonna head off to bed.

38:54.751 --> 38:56.378
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

38:56.419 --> 38:58.672
You can just come in, you can
get me if you need something.

38:58.713 --> 39:00.173
Bedtime.
Right there.

39:00.215 --> 39:02.550
-Good night!
-Good night, guys.

39:02.592 --> 39:04.219
Love you, girlies.

39:04.260 --> 39:05.762
Love you, good night.

39:10.433 --> 39:13.520
The plan for tomorrow,
you must get up at 9:00.

39:13.561 --> 39:15.271
Okay, thank you.

39:24.614 --> 39:26.116
That’s great, thank you.

39:27.283 --> 39:28.243
Oh, my gosh.

39:28.284 --> 39:29.119
Mm-hmm.

39:29.160 --> 39:30.704
Okay, I’m gonna vacuum here.

39:31.621 --> 39:33.748
Oh, they loved it.

39:33.790 --> 39:35.166
Thank you for your help, though.

39:35.208 --> 39:37.252
It would have been nothing
without the tail.

39:39.879 --> 39:43.049
When I first start a job,
I try to impress

39:43.091 --> 39:47.387
by jumping into it, working my
behind as much as possible.

39:48.847 --> 39:49.973
You don’t need to do that.

39:50.015 --> 39:53.268
-We’re practicing folds.
-Okay.

39:53.309 --> 39:55.186
Thank you for your help.

39:57.188 --> 39:58.356
Good night.

40:22.464 --> 40:23.882
[text chime]

40:35.977 --> 40:38.563
<i>Tash, Tash, Dave.</i>

40:38.605 --> 40:40.148
<i>Can you meet me in the galley?</i>

40:40.190 --> 40:42.108
Maybe put the
paddleboards out too.

40:43.026 --> 40:44.235
I need to talk to you.

40:45.653 --> 40:46.613
What, right now?

40:46.654 --> 40:47.781
He’s calling me a bully.

40:47.822 --> 40:48.948
Who said that?

40:48.990 --> 40:50.158
That’s what your
boyfriend said.

40:51.076 --> 40:52.410
Your boyfriend said I’m a bully.

40:56.748 --> 40:57.999
Huh?

41:01.670 --> 41:03.171
I’ve made so many mistakes.

41:03.213 --> 41:05.006
Dave and I should
never have happened.

41:05.048 --> 41:07.008
But mine and
my ex’s relationship

41:07.050 --> 41:08.802
should have ended years ago.

41:08.843 --> 41:10.845
Yet, I let it get to this,

41:10.887 --> 41:13.056
and now he’s just
trying to hurt me.

41:16.393 --> 41:17.769
Bully?

41:17.811 --> 41:19.604
I don’t know where on Earth
he’s got that from.

41:19.646 --> 41:21.815
It’s, like, one of the one
things that I hate most in life.

41:21.856 --> 41:23.233
I’m not a bully.

41:23.274 --> 41:24.526
Okay, so, what...

41:24.567 --> 41:25.985
how do you want me to deal
with this situation?

41:26.027 --> 41:27.028
I don’t, I want you to know.

41:27.070 --> 41:28.154
-I just want...
-To message him?

41:28.196 --> 41:29.280
No, not at all.
I just want...

41:29.322 --> 41:32.409
I’m just talking
to you about it.

41:32.450 --> 41:35.453
It’s a super
sh-- situation, Tash.

41:35.495 --> 41:38.039
Hello, good morning.

41:38.081 --> 41:40.125
Would you like a
coffee, a juice?

41:40.166 --> 41:41.376
Great.

41:41.418 --> 41:43.795
I don’t know who the [bleep]
he thinks he is.

41:43.837 --> 41:45.380
I’ve never been
aggressive towards you.

41:45.422 --> 41:46.423
[laughs]

41:46.464 --> 41:50.260
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

41:50.301 --> 41:52.095
When have I ever been
aggressive towards you?

42:00.603 --> 42:02.105
Our job requires
working together.

42:02.147 --> 42:03.898
I’m sick of pussyfooting
around you,

42:03.940 --> 42:05.442
I’m ----ing done with it.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.451
-Tash.
-Some messages.

42:16.786 --> 42:18.747
All right, I did that once
that one time

42:18.788 --> 42:21.041
when I sent you those messages.

42:22.542 --> 42:23.918
It’s a load of rubbish.

42:23.960 --> 42:27.088
It hurts me, like, seeing...
it’s crap.

42:27.130 --> 42:28.340
He’s a ----ing wanker.

42:28.381 --> 42:29.632
How dare he?

42:29.674 --> 42:33.178
If he wants to bring me
into it too, I’m in.

42:37.807 --> 42:39.768
This is so stupid.

42:39.809 --> 42:42.395
All right, I’m not gonna talk
to any of this, it’s just...

42:46.149 --> 42:48.234
What... what do you mean?

42:57.702 --> 42:59.412
[bleep]

42:59.454 --> 43:01.206
This is all building and
building and building.

43:01.247 --> 43:03.083
It’s just this massive
snowball right now,

43:03.124 --> 43:06.252
and it’s getting out of control.

43:06.294 --> 43:07.253
Sh--.

43:12.842 --> 43:15.345
Next, on the season finale
of "Below Deck Mediterranean."

43:15.387 --> 43:16.638
We’re taking
all our clothes off.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.306
Oh, my God!

43:18.348 --> 43:19.641
-Deal?
-No.

43:19.683 --> 43:20.809
-[bleep]
-Woo!

43:20.850 --> 43:23.061
You’re such a stripper.

43:23.103 --> 43:25.730
This night is definitely
the wildest sides

43:25.772 --> 43:26.731
I’ve seen of everybody.

43:26.773 --> 43:28.942
-Like, Tash...
-Woo!

43:28.983 --> 43:31.069
I did not see that side of her.

43:33.947 --> 43:36.324
Kyle!

43:36.366 --> 43:38.368
Hello!

43:38.410 --> 43:40.078
I’m back!

43:40.120 --> 43:42.122
All right, pancakes.

43:42.163 --> 43:43.373
They look raw on the inside.

43:43.415 --> 43:45.583
That sh-- is just
----ing terrible.

43:47.794 --> 43:51.631
I think that you can have fun
and it not be serious.

43:51.673 --> 43:53.216
[alarm sounds]

43:53.258 --> 43:56.928
It is my second day on board,
and I’m late to work.

43:56.970 --> 43:58.304
Ellie.

43:58.346 --> 44:01.349
My rose was gelling into
my role with my crew.

44:01.391 --> 44:03.059
Forgot to mention
one of your roses.

44:03.101 --> 44:04.060
Get your sh-- together.

44:04.102 --> 44:05.311
Like, that pisses me off.

44:05.353 --> 44:06.104
Oh, my God.

44:06.146 --> 44:07.313
What is Storm doing?

44:07.355 --> 44:08.606
Wait, what is happening
over there?

44:08.648 --> 44:10.275
-Oh, my God.
-Storm!
