WEBVTT

00:02.152 --> 00:04.819
All right.
Thank you all for coming.

00:04.913 --> 00:06.079
I've got a big announcement.

00:06.232 --> 00:07.506
You getting a haircut?

00:07.657 --> 00:09.491
You really think she asked
all of us here at 7:00 a.m.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.568
to tell us that
she's getting a haircut?

00:11.570 --> 00:13.420
That's what I would do.

00:13.572 --> 00:15.756
I know what it is.
She's finally coming out.

00:15.908 --> 00:16.664
Everyone pay me.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.076
Mother, I'm not gay.

00:19.094 --> 00:21.836
We would support
any choice you make, dear.

00:21.930 --> 00:22.763
Except for bangs.

00:23.766 --> 00:26.266
She's definitely not gay.
My gaydar never fails.

00:26.418 --> 00:28.027
Except with Anderson Cooper.

00:28.178 --> 00:30.254
How did I miss that?

00:30.347 --> 00:33.348
Anyway, thank you all
for being here.

00:33.517 --> 00:35.367
You're basically my family,

00:35.594 --> 00:36.702
even you, Mother.

00:38.113 --> 00:40.205
So, here's my big news.

00:40.357 --> 00:42.541
I'm gonna have a baby!

00:42.768 --> 00:44.376
-What?
-How?

00:44.528 --> 00:45.527
-When?
-Why?

00:45.546 --> 00:48.288
I'd like to circle back.
What?

00:48.440 --> 00:49.531
Uh, the correct response is,

00:49.550 --> 00:51.792
"Yay, Kat.
We're so happy for you."

00:51.886 --> 00:54.444
Darling, that's so wonderful.

00:54.463 --> 00:57.281
Oh, sweetheart,
what incredible news.

00:57.283 --> 01:00.225
It also explains why you're
wearing that maternity outfit.

01:00.377 --> 01:03.620
I'm not pregnant yet,
but I'm gonna be.

01:03.713 --> 01:05.472
Hmm. So, who's the lucky guy?

01:05.566 --> 01:08.308
Well, I know
it's not Anderson Cooper.

01:08.477 --> 01:10.885
Are you thinking
immaculate conception?

01:10.905 --> 01:13.739
Probably more likely than you
catching a man in those glasses.

01:13.924 --> 01:16.391
I'm gonna do it with a donor.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.725
Well, not "do it."

01:17.745 --> 01:19.912
I believe the medical term
is "get juiced up by."

01:20.806 --> 01:22.656
Well, are you sure you're ready
to be a single parent?

01:22.808 --> 01:24.666
'Cause Carter makes it look
very hard.

01:25.569 --> 01:26.734
Truth.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.313
Look, I know you had fun
with my nephew,

01:29.331 --> 01:30.738
but that was only eight hours.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.758
Do you know how many eight hours
there are in a lifetime?

01:32.985 --> 01:35.260
We know you know, sweetheart.

01:35.487 --> 01:38.430
I searched for my life's purpose
all over the world.

01:38.582 --> 01:41.100
And then I held
that little baby, and...

01:41.251 --> 01:42.417
Did your ovaries tingle?

01:42.544 --> 01:45.104
Like Pop Rocks.
(imitates popping)

01:46.256 --> 01:48.232
That could be an infection.

01:49.852 --> 01:51.759
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

01:51.779 --> 01:54.822
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

01:55.932 --> 01:58.617
Ooh. This guy could be
your baby daddy.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.268
Yeah, don't say that.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.938
Let's see. Six-two, green eyes.
Ooh, he's a doctor.

02:04.032 --> 02:06.608
Oh.
A Doctor Strange impersonator.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.775
No, thank you.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.278
Girl, he is five-ten at best.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.538
This is just like Tinder.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.358
-Subtract inches but add pounds.
-(chuckles)

02:14.376 --> 02:15.617
It's true.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.118
I'm six-three on Grindr.

02:17.138 --> 02:19.954
Well, aren't guys disappointed
when they meet you?

02:19.974 --> 02:21.865
Not once I open my mouth.

02:21.884 --> 02:23.791
Well, you are very charming.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.535
Yes, that's what I mean.

02:26.221 --> 02:28.722
(singsongy):
Ooh! This guy's on sale.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.466
Oh, I see why, 'cause he's dead.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.059
Well, hang on,
I do love a bargain.

02:33.212 --> 02:35.762
Okay, your eggs are already
on their way out.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.639
You need fresh sausage.

02:37.716 --> 02:40.901
It's really tough to make
this decision based on one form.

02:41.053 --> 02:43.053
Yeah. Yeah, like,
like, who cares

02:43.071 --> 02:44.979
that this guy was
in Thunder Down Under?

02:45.148 --> 02:46.540
Wait, hold on.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.817
I'm gonna make
my own "yes" pile.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.079
My child's whole future
depends on this.

02:53.232 --> 02:54.731
It's too much pressure.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.066
Katharine, just let me choose.

02:56.084 --> 02:58.343
Everyone knows you have
terrible taste,

02:58.570 --> 03:00.495
just look at your...

03:00.514 --> 03:01.571
life.

03:02.332 --> 03:04.666
Randi, you don't talk to
your mother. What's that like?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.577
You know, I feel like
I need more information.

03:07.671 --> 03:10.338
If I buy the premium package,
I-I get, I get baby pictures,

03:10.432 --> 03:12.173
medical history,
and a personal essay.

03:12.193 --> 03:15.027
I think that'll help me feel
more connected to my donor.

03:15.254 --> 03:17.863
You know,
put the "us" in "uterus."

03:18.014 --> 03:22.659
You know these puns are
why you have to pay for sperm.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.121
(quiet chatter)

03:27.616 --> 03:29.750
(music playing faintly)

03:32.788 --> 03:34.046
Man, I don't get it.

03:34.273 --> 03:36.048
How can this place have
twice as many customers

03:36.199 --> 03:37.365
as the Middle C?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.276
I mean,
it's a stupid board game bar.

03:39.369 --> 03:41.962
Yeah, your piano bar is
so much cooler.

03:42.056 --> 03:45.632
Says the man who asked me
how he looked with frosted tips.

03:46.452 --> 03:48.118
All right.
Competition checked out.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.062
Now let's go back to
your bar and drink for free.

03:50.289 --> 03:51.396
Wait, hold on, hold on,
I'm sorry.

03:51.548 --> 03:53.047
You don't drink for free.
You have a tab.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.882
(laughs) Okay.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.977
(laughs) You do.

03:57.129 --> 03:58.628
Fine. We'll drink here.

03:58.647 --> 04:00.480
Let's just-- Oh, dang it.

04:00.632 --> 04:02.223
I forgot my wallet.

04:02.392 --> 04:03.633
Just look at 'em all.

04:03.635 --> 04:05.786
Playing games
like a bunch of 12-year-olds.

04:05.895 --> 04:06.820
So sad.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.747
Ooh! They got
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

04:08.898 --> 04:11.208
-Dibs on blue!
-Dibs on blue! Damn it.

04:12.494 --> 04:13.643
Hold up.

04:13.662 --> 04:15.145
Is homegirl wearing elf ears?

04:15.238 --> 04:16.663
MAX:
Shh! Don't stare.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.573
It could be a condition.

04:18.667 --> 04:21.093
And we're really not supposed
to make fun of anything anymore.

04:21.244 --> 04:24.579
Welcome to Corks and Orcs.
Can I get you guys anything?

04:24.673 --> 04:27.173
Grog, mead, chicken fingers?

04:27.326 --> 04:29.175
Two beers. On him.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.770
Also, uh,
why are there elves here?

04:31.921 --> 04:33.105
Excuse me?

04:33.256 --> 04:36.516
Oh, I'm sorry,
Elven-Americans.

04:36.668 --> 04:38.092
It's D&D night.

04:38.261 --> 04:39.836
Dungeons & Dragons?

04:39.855 --> 04:42.005
Ah, see? Your friend gets it,
he's wearing the ears.

04:42.098 --> 04:43.615
What?

04:43.767 --> 04:45.600
There's another game
starting in 15 minutes

04:45.619 --> 04:46.809
if you guys want in.

04:46.811 --> 04:49.513
I'll be Dungeon Master, so...

04:49.531 --> 04:53.107
you guys are in for
a pretty crazy 68 hours.

04:53.127 --> 04:57.704
D&D? I think I'll pass,
you know, 'cause I've had sex.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.206
(chuckles) Me, too. A lot.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.466
I'm talking double digits.

05:01.618 --> 05:02.876
-What?
-(chuckles)

05:03.028 --> 05:05.028
So, you think
you're better than us?

05:05.047 --> 05:07.547
-Sorry, not at all.
-Yeah, just cooler.

05:07.699 --> 05:09.141
Now, please,
bring our beers over

05:09.368 --> 05:11.393
to the Hungry Hungry Hippos
table.

05:14.148 --> 05:17.874
I'm deciding what
my grandchild should call me.

05:17.876 --> 05:20.560
What do you guys
think of "Glam-ma?"

05:20.654 --> 05:21.711
"Glam-ma?"

05:21.730 --> 05:23.380
A grandma sits on a porch,

05:23.398 --> 05:24.881
plays Parcheesi,
and crochets.

05:24.974 --> 05:27.717
A glam-ma drinks champagne,
does Pilates,

05:27.736 --> 05:32.998
and once smoked reefer naked
with Sammy Davis Jr.

05:33.817 --> 05:35.108
I found him, I found him!

05:35.260 --> 05:36.484
I found the father of my child!

05:36.578 --> 05:38.411
Does anyone else hear
a chorus of angels?

05:38.505 --> 05:39.913
(vocalizes)

05:40.007 --> 05:41.581
Wait, were you doing that
upstairs?

05:41.733 --> 05:44.158
I thought you were just taking
one of your special showers.

05:44.236 --> 05:47.737
Rejoice in the miracle
that is donor 457.

05:47.831 --> 05:50.015
-Let Glam-ma hold him.
-(chuckles)

05:50.242 --> 05:51.350
He's perfect.

05:51.577 --> 05:53.243
He's an architect,
he studied at Georgetown.

05:53.261 --> 05:55.428
He speaks four languages.

05:55.581 --> 05:57.097
He's a former United States
Scrabble Champion.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.432
He once got a triple-word score
with "xylophone."

05:59.526 --> 06:01.026
How sexy is that?

06:01.177 --> 06:02.027
What does he look like?

06:02.196 --> 06:03.177
Phil, don't be so shallow.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.588
He's six feet tall.

06:04.606 --> 06:07.440
He's got blue eyes.
He's a snack and a dessert.

06:07.517 --> 06:10.110
Oh, he was a swimmer
in college.

06:10.204 --> 06:13.521
Ooh, big swimmers make
the best little swimmers,

06:13.540 --> 06:14.764
if you know what I mean.

06:14.783 --> 06:15.874
I don't.

06:16.101 --> 06:19.836
Your subtle sperm joke
shot right over my head.

06:20.697 --> 06:22.363
Get this, his personal essay

06:22.383 --> 06:24.791
starts with a Gandhi quote
and ends with a Weezer lyric.

06:24.943 --> 06:28.128
"You must be the change
you wish to see in the world."

06:28.280 --> 06:31.539
"The redhead said you shred
the cello, and I am Jell-O."

06:31.633 --> 06:34.041
Damn, girl,
it sounds like you're in love.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.970
No. Just with his DNA.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.455
And his soul.

06:38.548 --> 06:40.565
And don't forget
his swimmer's body

06:40.792 --> 06:42.809
like our Lord Jesus.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.694
Amen!

06:50.911 --> 06:52.577
I always dreamed
my daughter would get

06:52.729 --> 06:54.137
knocked up by a doctor.

06:54.156 --> 06:57.657
Note to self, be more specific
in your prayers.

06:57.751 --> 07:01.161
Mother, why did you come if
you're just gonna be yourself?

07:01.313 --> 07:04.071
I'm gonna be here
for every step of this process.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.926
I have excellent advice
regarding chapped nipples.

07:08.077 --> 07:09.744
You bottle-fed me.

07:09.838 --> 07:12.914
I know, but those six months
in Ibiza

07:12.933 --> 07:14.991
really did a number
on the girls.

07:15.010 --> 07:18.495
Yeah, let's not mention that
ever again.

07:18.513 --> 07:21.273
-Hello.
-Hi.

07:21.424 --> 07:22.607
Sorry I'm late.

07:22.834 --> 07:24.592
-I've been elbow-deep
in it today.
-(chuckles)

07:24.611 --> 07:25.777
Gynecologist humor?

07:25.929 --> 07:27.195
You get me.

07:27.764 --> 07:28.930
So, good news.

07:28.991 --> 07:31.841
You and donor 457 are
a perfect genetic match.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.601
(gasps) Do you hear that,
ladies?

07:33.695 --> 07:35.011
(imitates popping)

07:35.030 --> 07:37.289
(laughs):
Sorry, I'm just really excited!

07:37.440 --> 07:38.531
Hold on.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.126
Looks like the clinic has
run out of his...

07:41.319 --> 07:42.535
let's say "batter."

07:42.629 --> 07:44.779
Uh, what do you mean?
How could they be out?

07:44.798 --> 07:47.281
The men I've known
are never out.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.501
Well, let's get my guy
down here.

07:49.653 --> 07:51.711
You get the cup ready,
I'll go on a porn run.

07:51.863 --> 07:54.531
Unfortunately,
he just turned 35.

07:54.549 --> 07:57.124
So? I'm sure
he's still making it.

07:57.219 --> 07:58.810
Wait, is he a hoarder?

07:58.962 --> 08:01.871
After 35, there's
a higher risk of complications,

08:01.890 --> 08:03.540
so he can no longer donate.

08:03.633 --> 08:04.724
Well, they've got
to have some more

08:04.818 --> 08:06.133
just lying around somewhere.

08:06.228 --> 08:07.377
Tell 'em, "Look in the back
of the freezer,"

08:07.395 --> 08:08.545
behind the old meat

08:08.563 --> 08:10.547
and the ice cubes
that smell like garlic.

08:10.565 --> 08:11.806
I'm sorry.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.824
Are you?

08:12.976 --> 08:14.384
Or are you just saving
the last drop

08:14.386 --> 08:15.885
of donor 457 for yourself?!

08:16.830 --> 08:19.998
You can see why I didn't want
her anywhere near my nipples.

08:23.486 --> 08:25.078
You doing okay?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.654
I just feel empty.

08:26.748 --> 08:29.082
My heart, my womb.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.458
Well, don't give up.

08:30.569 --> 08:32.326
There's plenty of fish
in the sea...

08:32.346 --> 08:33.236
men.

08:33.255 --> 08:34.620
(scoffs)

08:34.681 --> 08:37.590
(chuckles): I'm so naughty, but
it was just right there.

08:37.743 --> 08:39.017
(chuckles)

08:39.168 --> 08:41.244
Uh, I'm gonna you need
to stop hugging

08:41.263 --> 08:42.854
donor 457's profile.

08:43.081 --> 08:44.931
(sighs) I'm just not ready
to give up.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.652
He is so much more
than a sperm Popsicle to me.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.529
Got you a whiskey.

08:50.680 --> 08:52.272
I don't think
there's a cocktail that says,

08:52.424 --> 08:53.923
"Sorry you lost your anonymous

08:54.092 --> 08:56.034
artificial insemination
partner."

08:56.185 --> 08:58.094
But there is a Hallmark card.

08:58.187 --> 09:00.038
They have gotten
so specific these days.

09:00.189 --> 09:01.206
(Max laughs)

09:01.433 --> 09:03.649
There should be
a special bar for ladies

09:03.710 --> 09:06.044
to meet guys who just want
to donate sperm.

09:06.195 --> 09:08.788
There is.
It's called any bar.

09:08.940 --> 09:10.774
What did you do to your arm?

09:10.867 --> 09:13.051
Oh. Hurt it in the game
last night.

09:13.278 --> 09:15.036
But, uh, I played through.

09:15.130 --> 09:17.889
That game was
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.724
I still schooled his ass,
though.

09:19.876 --> 09:21.208
Wasn't an official win.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.468
I knocked the game off the table

09:22.621 --> 09:24.521
before you chomped
the last marble.

09:25.307 --> 09:26.547
We used to play that game,

09:26.641 --> 09:28.716
but we played it with possums
and our toes.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.219
That's why my cousin Levon can
only count to 17.

09:32.964 --> 09:34.573
Maybe I should get
some board games in here.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.484
But cool ones, where the kids
are on the box like, "Whoa!"

09:38.653 --> 09:41.746
And then there's always
that kid who broke the ice.

09:41.898 --> 09:43.915
As long as it's not
like that game

09:44.067 --> 09:45.399
those nerds were playing
last night.

09:45.568 --> 09:48.995
I don't know. D&D looked
pretty fun last night.

09:49.147 --> 09:51.314
D&D, is that like S and M?

09:51.483 --> 09:54.134
Same weapons, different uses.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.747
Good morning.
Sorry I'm late.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.174
Oh, but you're
five minutes early.

10:01.326 --> 10:05.103
Really? Then I got
ten minutes to take a nap.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.438
KAT:
I found him!

10:06.665 --> 10:08.255
I found him! I found him!

10:08.275 --> 10:12.611
Who? D.B. Cooper,
Jimmy Hoffa, Waldo?

10:12.762 --> 10:15.021
Better. Donor 457.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.856
His name is Brian Anderson.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.509
(laughs maniacally):
He will be mine.

10:19.527 --> 10:23.196
Aw, you think this has
a happy ending, don't you?

10:23.348 --> 10:24.623
Finding him wasn't that hard.

10:24.774 --> 10:27.142
You just start with
what you know: 35, architect,

10:27.144 --> 10:28.776
Georgetown, swim team.

10:28.870 --> 10:30.277
The Internet has photos
of the swim team

10:30.297 --> 10:31.855
from 2005 to 2010.

10:31.948 --> 10:34.540
I found all the guys his height
with blue eyes, got 22 names.

10:34.693 --> 10:36.209
Well, 23 if you count
the guy wearing goggles,

10:36.303 --> 10:37.469
because we can't rule him out.

10:37.696 --> 10:38.878
I took all those names,

10:39.030 --> 10:40.380
cross-referenced them
with the database

10:40.474 --> 10:42.048
from the American Institute
of Architects.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.291
I did have to register,
but let me tell you,

10:44.386 --> 10:46.645
best 1,200 bucks
I've ever spent.

10:46.796 --> 10:48.480
You watch,
she's gonna put him

10:48.631 --> 10:50.874
in a pit in her basement.

10:50.967 --> 10:52.984
Only one hit
in the greater Louisville area,

10:53.211 --> 10:54.544
Brian Anderson.

10:54.562 --> 10:55.712
Couple hours on Instagram,
and I found him.

10:55.730 --> 10:56.988
I mean, I'm good.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.549
Pretty sure I could've found
Bin Laden in an afternoon.

10:59.567 --> 11:01.885
So what, you're gonna
slide into his DMs

11:01.903 --> 11:03.052
and ask him
for his sperm?

11:03.071 --> 11:05.054
No, Randi,
that would be crazy.

11:05.073 --> 11:07.499
I bet she's already
dug the pit.

11:07.650 --> 11:09.501
I learned two things
from Instagram.

11:09.728 --> 11:12.837
One, our kid is gonna be...
(singsongy): hot.

11:12.989 --> 11:15.006
Two, Brian teaches kickboxing
once a week.

11:15.158 --> 11:17.083
I signed us both up,
and after the class

11:17.235 --> 11:20.086
I'm gonna ask for his seed
in person like a lady do.

11:20.255 --> 11:22.922
Oh, Kat, you're gonna end up
on the news again.

this time.

I don't see Brian yet.

some sort of walk-in song.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.696
I'm guessing "Eye of the Tiger."

11:37.847 --> 11:38.863
Hey, crazy idea,

11:39.015 --> 11:40.514
how about we just take
a kickboxing class

11:40.608 --> 11:43.276
and not ask anyone
for their sausage gravy?

11:43.428 --> 11:45.094
That reminds me,
I've the cup in my bag.

11:45.113 --> 11:46.538
It's actually
just an old jelly jar,

11:46.707 --> 11:47.764
but I washed it out real good.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.870
No, I can't, 'cause I'm Black.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.538
Okay, this is gonna be easy.

12:04.632 --> 12:06.874
All I have to do is charm him,
earn his trust

12:06.893 --> 12:09.710
and secure his semen--
charm, trust, semen.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.471
Welcome, everyone.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.289
Who's here for the first time
tonight?

12:13.308 --> 12:15.049
Uh, we are!
Kickboxing virgins.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.568
We're not
the other kind of virgins.

12:16.795 --> 12:20.964
I have kickboxed before,
so I am no kind of virgin.

12:21.057 --> 12:22.389
Uh, damn you!

12:22.409 --> 12:24.242
Oh, he's coming over.
Okay, how do I look?

12:24.393 --> 12:26.536
Uh, like you should've
worn a sports bra.

12:27.806 --> 12:29.396
-Hey, I'm Brian.
-Hello, Brian!

12:29.565 --> 12:31.140
My name is Kat,
this is my very good friend...

12:31.234 --> 12:33.810
Brenda! Brenda is my name.

12:33.903 --> 12:35.828
And I don't know her,
we just met.

12:35.981 --> 12:39.999
(chuckles):
So I am not legally responsible
for anything that she does.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.486
Okay, you guys are, uh...

12:43.579 --> 12:45.746
-let's call it "fun."
-(laughter)

12:45.840 --> 12:46.914
Anyway, enjoy your first class.

12:47.008 --> 12:48.324
And don't worry,
I'll be gentle.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.159
Oh, I don't mind
if you're a little rough.

12:50.178 --> 12:51.978
I like it rough. (growls)

12:52.847 --> 12:53.938
Okay, now, which part was that?

12:54.165 --> 12:56.024
The charm, the trust
or the semen?

13:00.096 --> 13:03.430
Ooh... Ooh,
I like the vibe in here.

13:03.525 --> 13:06.009
It's like
my cousin Stewie's basement.

13:06.027 --> 13:08.620
Kissed my first girl there,
and my last.

13:08.771 --> 13:11.848
(chuckles) Oh, man, I want
to hear all those stories.

13:11.866 --> 13:13.607
Let me buy you a...
Ah, dang it.

13:13.701 --> 13:16.044
Did I forget my wallet again?

13:17.464 --> 13:20.614
More men in here
than in a gay bar.

13:20.692 --> 13:23.042
And if this is
you coming out to me,

13:23.136 --> 13:27.680
you should know
that I am not a beginner's ride.

13:28.624 --> 13:29.790
I will keep that in mind.

13:30.552 --> 13:34.203
So, do you play
this Dungeons game?

13:34.297 --> 13:35.538
I did when I was a kid.

13:35.631 --> 13:37.315
Yeah, it was, uh, it was
a good way to make friends

13:37.392 --> 13:40.301
when I was 14 and thought
it was cool to wear a cape.

13:40.395 --> 13:41.878
(chuckling):
A cape?

13:41.896 --> 13:44.638
-Are you sure
you're not coming out to me?
-(laughs)

13:44.658 --> 13:46.549
You guys need drinks? Oh.

13:46.568 --> 13:48.660
It's Hungry Hippo guy.

13:48.811 --> 13:50.644
-We're still picking up marbles.
-(chuckles)

13:50.738 --> 13:52.071
Sorry about that.

13:52.223 --> 13:53.331
Uh, two IPAs.

13:53.482 --> 13:55.667
Oh, hey, any of
these D&D games open?

13:55.818 --> 13:57.577
Uh, yeah,
table six just started.

13:57.671 --> 13:58.837
You can probably jump in.

13:59.064 --> 14:00.338
If you find the<i> Book of Thoth,</i>

14:00.489 --> 14:02.081
you get a free pitcher
of Arnold Palmers.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.233
(players cheering)

14:04.327 --> 14:05.826
Eat my chromatic orb!

14:05.846 --> 14:08.162
-Ooyah!
-(cheering, whooping)

14:08.256 --> 14:10.239
What the hell is he doing here?

14:10.333 --> 14:12.499
This is like the time
my boyfriend caught me

14:12.519 --> 14:14.602
in a sports bar.

14:19.342 --> 14:20.341
(groans)

14:20.360 --> 14:23.010
He's a hungry hungry hypocrite.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.679
-Let's go.
-But don't you want
to call him out?

14:25.699 --> 14:28.849
Slap him a little?
I was promised entertainment.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.201
Not here.

14:30.353 --> 14:32.019
I respect the game too much.

14:32.113 --> 14:34.263
Well, let me take you
to my favorite bar.

14:34.432 --> 14:36.432
We play games there, too.

14:36.451 --> 14:38.459
Oh, and you can wear your cape.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.214
Just look at him.

14:43.366 --> 14:44.531
Between his guns and my quads,

14:44.626 --> 14:47.110
our baby's gonna be
a hunter and a gatherer.

14:47.128 --> 14:48.778
Kat, pay attention.

14:48.796 --> 14:51.014
Oh. (scoffs) I am.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.633
Hey!

14:53.785 --> 14:56.144
I'm soon to be with child!

14:56.971 --> 14:58.062
Ooh! Nice kick.

14:58.289 --> 14:59.880
Hard to believe you're a virgin.

14:59.974 --> 15:01.974
Ooh, kickboxing virgin.
You guys said it.

15:02.127 --> 15:04.293
She said it.
Again, I don't know her.

15:04.387 --> 15:06.404
Um, did you...
did you see my kicks?

15:06.573 --> 15:08.072
They were, uh,
kick-tastic. (chuckles)

15:08.299 --> 15:11.392
Kick-tacular.
I was kicking it old-school.

15:11.486 --> 15:13.912
-Yeah, great.
Could you back up a little?
-Yeah.

15:14.063 --> 15:15.079
Of course.

15:15.306 --> 15:17.582
All right. Give me a groin kick.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.308
-Put some snap on it.
-Okay.

15:19.327 --> 15:21.310
My future baby's in that groin,

15:21.329 --> 15:22.754
and he's not even wearing a cup.

15:22.905 --> 15:24.672
What, you don't think I looked?

15:25.667 --> 15:29.093
(slow-motion):
No...

15:30.096 --> 15:31.554
(Randi screams)

15:32.323 --> 15:34.098
Takedown! (chuckles)

15:34.325 --> 15:36.325
Silver for the gold.

15:36.327 --> 15:38.995
My last name is Silver.
(chuckles)

15:39.088 --> 15:40.104
Are you okay?

15:40.348 --> 15:41.347
Yeah, just thinking about
all my life choices

15:41.499 --> 15:43.499
that have led me to this moment.

15:43.518 --> 15:44.776
Well, why don't you
take a little break?

15:44.927 --> 15:46.093
There's some water
by the front.

15:46.171 --> 15:48.613
-Oh, uh, can you bring me some?
-Hell no.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.177
Guess we're alone.

15:54.937 --> 15:57.438
Except for
the other 18 people here, yeah.

15:57.532 --> 15:59.773
All right, let's see
some roundhouse kicks.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.084
(clears throat)

16:04.965 --> 16:06.022
Harder.

16:06.191 --> 16:07.966
As you wish, sensei.

16:08.710 --> 16:10.710
I like your shorts.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.453
Do they keep you cool?

16:12.472 --> 16:15.515
You, uh, don't want
the basement to get overheated.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.034
Where'd you get 'em?

16:18.127 --> 16:19.310
Goodwill.

16:19.462 --> 16:20.794
Ooh, thrifty.

16:20.814 --> 16:21.704
It's a good trait.

16:21.797 --> 16:24.006
Might be genetic,
might not.

16:24.008 --> 16:25.132
Was your father thrifty?

16:25.376 --> 16:27.801
I don't really know.
He died when I was young.

16:27.895 --> 16:30.713
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

16:30.732 --> 16:32.824
Was it something hereditary?

16:32.975 --> 16:36.052
-Bus accident.
-Whew! (laughs)

16:36.145 --> 16:37.311
You're probably wondering

16:37.330 --> 16:38.496
why I'm asking
all these questions.

16:38.647 --> 16:40.723
I'm wondering a lot of things
about you.

16:40.742 --> 16:42.816
All right, I'll just
come right out and say it.

16:43.728 --> 16:46.412
You're donor 457
from the Kentucky Foundation

16:46.564 --> 16:48.397
for Reproductive Services,
right?

16:48.491 --> 16:49.656
What?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.509
It's supposed to be anonymous.

16:51.586 --> 16:53.236
Aha! Confirmed!

16:53.329 --> 16:54.420
Randi, it's him!

16:54.572 --> 16:56.739
Cue the chorus of the angels!
(vocalizes)

16:56.758 --> 16:59.500
-Kat, let's-let's go.
-No, no, no.
Look, Brian, Brian.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.002
All I need is one last hurrah
in a jelly jar.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.688
And I don't have any porn on me,
but think about

17:03.839 --> 17:06.024
that Sandals vacation you took
with your hot girlfriend

17:06.175 --> 17:08.008
two years ago.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.435
Sandals?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.420
How do you know-- You know what?
You need to leave.

17:11.439 --> 17:12.679
Oh, oh, I see,

17:12.699 --> 17:14.106
so it's like sperm-a-palooza
for everyone else,

17:14.259 --> 17:16.034
but when I need it,
your well's run dry?

17:16.185 --> 17:17.760
I said get out.

17:17.779 --> 17:19.278
-Yeah, time to go.
-You listen to me, Brian.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.614
If you won't give me your seed
of life, I'm gonna take it.

17:21.766 --> 17:23.023
No, Kat!

17:23.043 --> 17:25.484
Okay. New plan. Fill this up.
I'll be back later.

17:25.636 --> 17:26.669
What?

17:29.382 --> 17:30.882
I appreciate you waiting
with me, Phil,

17:31.109 --> 17:33.793
but when Carter gets back,
things could get ugly.

17:33.945 --> 17:35.461
Why do you think I'm waiting?

17:35.613 --> 17:38.781
I can't believe
he would lie to me like this.

17:38.950 --> 17:41.375
Are you so mad you want
to take your shirt off?

17:41.394 --> 17:44.187
-What?
-What?

17:46.066 --> 17:48.900
Well, look who it is.

17:49.051 --> 17:50.126
How was your night?

17:50.144 --> 17:51.552
And before you answer,

17:51.571 --> 17:53.571
know that I have cast a
third-level Zone of Truth spell.

17:53.798 --> 17:55.222
Oh. Well, joke's on you,

17:55.316 --> 17:57.800
'cause I'm wearing
a plus-two Cloak of Deception.

17:57.893 --> 18:00.912
-And it fits you well.
-Mm-hmm.

18:01.063 --> 18:04.082
This is not as sexy
as I thought it'd be.

18:04.309 --> 18:07.418
I don't get it. Why didn't you
just admit you like D&D?

18:07.570 --> 18:10.070
If it's okay to like it,
why didn't you say something?

18:10.164 --> 18:11.480
Because you made fun of it,

18:11.574 --> 18:13.257
and I didn't want you
to make fun of me.

18:13.334 --> 18:15.909
Being straight is
so complicated.

18:16.003 --> 18:17.670
Look, where I grew up,
if you admit

18:17.764 --> 18:20.172
you're into something like that,
you get your ass kicked.

18:20.325 --> 18:21.874
Yeah, kids can be mean.

18:22.026 --> 18:23.326
So can my mom.

18:23.344 --> 18:25.586
Carter, Max, listen.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.590
As boys, we're taught you can't
be real with each other,

18:29.684 --> 18:31.776
but it's okay to be vulnerable.

18:32.003 --> 18:35.154
Take the "mask"
out of "masculine."

18:36.691 --> 18:37.782
Damn, Phil.

18:38.009 --> 18:40.192
You're half our size
but twice the man.

18:40.345 --> 18:42.269
I'm working on a book.

18:42.363 --> 18:43.437
(chuckles)

18:43.456 --> 18:44.847
Sorry I wasn't real with you.

18:44.866 --> 18:47.125
I should've known
you were a giant nerd.

18:47.326 --> 18:48.184
Dude.

18:48.277 --> 18:50.461
'Cause it takes one to know one.

18:50.613 --> 18:52.088
Dude...

18:53.524 --> 18:57.301
Oh, that sandwich needs
some peanut butter.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.696
Okay, I don't know
why this is happening,

19:00.715 --> 19:01.881
but I need to be a part of it.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.457
-(laughter)
-Randi, get in here.

19:03.551 --> 19:05.459
Uh-uh.
If I don't do group texts,

19:05.553 --> 19:07.036
I definitely don't do
group hugs.

19:07.054 --> 19:08.462
(laughter)

19:08.481 --> 19:10.055
How did it go?
Did you get your donor?

19:10.208 --> 19:11.482
No.

19:11.634 --> 19:13.726
I got banned from the sperm bank
and the kickboxing gym.

19:13.878 --> 19:15.711
-And the Froyo place
across the street.
-(sighs)

19:15.804 --> 19:18.990
There was a cute guy there,
I threw up a Hail Mary.

19:28.226 --> 19:31.169
All right, Princess Katharine
of House Feline,

19:31.320 --> 19:33.171
you've reached a door,
what do you do?

19:33.322 --> 19:34.747
-I open it.
-It's locked.

19:34.899 --> 19:36.065
-I knock.
-Nothing happens.

19:36.083 --> 19:37.324
-I search for a key.
-You don't have one.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.177
Oh, my gosh,
this is so much fun!

19:39.328 --> 19:40.845
I have the magical key of Mylor.

19:41.072 --> 19:43.514
-Should I use it?
-What? No!

19:43.666 --> 19:44.682
How the hell do you think
we're gonna get into

19:44.833 --> 19:46.075
the Tomb of Gary the Terrible?

19:46.093 --> 19:48.335
-Get your damn head in the game.
-(groans)

19:48.429 --> 19:49.670
Then what do we do?

19:49.764 --> 19:52.248
Let's hit the door
with a double fireball spell.

19:52.341 --> 19:53.524
Genius!

19:54.585 --> 19:57.102
So, you just never
want to have sex again?

19:57.255 --> 20:01.240
I'm gonna go hit my glass
with a double martini spell.

20:02.851 --> 20:04.368
So, the castle burns
to the ground.

20:04.595 --> 20:06.278
You hear the screams
of the orphans

20:06.431 --> 20:08.539
-you were trying to save.
-(groans)

20:09.434 --> 20:12.960
Where's my dragons at, bitches?

20:14.439 --> 20:16.697
Phil, I told you this wasn't
a dress-up game.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.367
Yeah, well, this is not
my last stop of the night.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.386
(laughs)

20:22.613 --> 20:24.972
Let's take a five.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.742
So, Zac, what's your story?

20:27.744 --> 20:30.877
Taught machine-learning
and robotics at Stanford.

20:30.972 --> 20:31.954
Intelligent.

20:31.973 --> 20:33.547
Then quit to open a game bar.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.549
-Adventurous.
Any major health problems?
-None.

20:35.643 --> 20:38.143
-You've got pretty curly hair,
you Jewish?
-I am.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.553
If I gave you a 100 bucks

20:39.572 --> 20:41.297
and this goblet,
do you think you could fill it

20:41.315 --> 20:43.407
with your elixir
of reproduction?

20:43.559 --> 20:45.468
I'm not for sale.

20:45.486 --> 20:47.161
Fair enough.

20:47.822 --> 20:49.321
Give me the goblet.
