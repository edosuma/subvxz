01:45.536 --> 01:47.712
And we're listening
to this because...

01:47.744 --> 01:49.152
It's the only show in town.

01:49.184 --> 01:50.624
That's nice for him.

01:50.656 --> 01:52.608
He's got a completely
captive audience.

01:53.856 --> 01:55.488
I wonder what he's saying.

01:57.792 --> 02:00.704
People of earth,
do not be afraid.

02:00.736 --> 02:02.816
Assimilation is painless.

02:02.848 --> 02:04.544
Yeah, but probing not so much.

02:06.112 --> 02:08.256
Hey, we could use my phone
to play some music.

02:08.288 --> 02:10.431
There is no auxiliary.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.968
Well, shit.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.353
- Indeed.
- We will live.

02:13.376 --> 02:14.784
I will not.

02:14.816 --> 02:16.640
I need a quick stop, okay?

02:19.744 --> 02:23.264
Whoo.

02:23.296 --> 02:24.608
That good, huh?

02:30.976 --> 02:32.448
Did you think about what I said?

02:35.200 --> 02:38.720
Yes.
I think it's a mistake.

02:38.752 --> 02:40.032
What, what we did, or...

02:40.064 --> 02:44.608
What we did
doesn't matter anymore, okay?

02:44.640 --> 02:47.296
But telling him about it does.

02:47.328 --> 02:50.304
- Yeah, it does.
- So we say nothing.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.689
What, what do you think,
I wanna tell him

02:51.712 --> 02:53.632
Just to break you guys up?

02:53.664 --> 02:54.880
Should I?

02:56.480 --> 02:58.185
You know this place
used to be a warzone

02:58.208 --> 03:00.160
A couple years ago.

03:00.192 --> 03:01.888
A warzone, really?

03:01.920 --> 03:04.288
- Huh.
- Yeah, tanks, artillery,

03:04.320 --> 03:06.976
Mines, the whole deal.

03:07.008 --> 03:08.736
What was it, like a civil war?

03:08.768 --> 03:09.952
Russians invaded.

03:09.984 --> 03:12.448
Shocker.

03:12.480 --> 03:15.328
Fucking Russians, man, they just
don't get it, nobody likes them.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.024
I mean seriously,
name one good thing

03:17.056 --> 03:18.656
To come out of Russia
other than, like,

03:18.688 --> 03:20.576
Really hot girl tennis players.

03:21.856 --> 03:23.808
Vodka.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.385
- Yeah, there's that.
- Vodka?

03:25.408 --> 03:26.848
The swedes make better vodka,

03:26.880 --> 03:29.248
Shit, even the French
make better vodka.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.976
Oil and gas.

03:31.008 --> 03:32.105
- What?
- The Russians,

03:32.128 --> 03:33.440
They make oil and gas.

03:33.472 --> 03:34.729
They don't make oil and gas,

03:34.752 --> 03:35.840
They have oil and gas.

03:35.872 --> 03:37.632
Yeah, right, it's not like

03:37.664 --> 03:39.785
Anyone said wow, this Russian
oil is so much better than that

03:39.808 --> 03:41.417
- watered down Saudi shit.
- Hold up,

03:41.440 --> 03:42.880
Let me get my bearings.

03:44.352 --> 03:46.880
- Are we on course?
- Yeah, I think we are.

03:48.256 --> 03:50.656
I give you the AK-47.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.512
When you absolutely...

03:52.544 --> 03:54.112
Positively gotta kill

03:54.144 --> 03:55.936
Every motherfucker in the room,

03:55.968 --> 03:57.696
Accept no substitutes.

03:57.728 --> 03:59.776
That's a good point.

03:59.808 --> 04:01.344
You shouldn't have seen that.

04:03.136 --> 04:05.225
It's kind of sad,
really, you know, the Russians,

04:05.248 --> 04:07.968
I thought they... I thought
they wanted to be free.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.112
- Be good.
- Be like us.

04:10.144 --> 04:12.064
All I know is
you never trust someone

04:12.096 --> 04:15.200
That comes from a country
that's successful with chess.

04:17.088 --> 04:18.752
Yeah, you all right?

04:18.784 --> 04:20.137
- Come on.
- I'm all right.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.504
All right, there you go.

04:21.536 --> 04:22.793
- All right?
- Up, all right.

04:22.816 --> 04:24.608
It's good, thank you.

04:25.728 --> 04:27.808
You're welcome.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.120
What?

04:30.944 --> 04:32.992
- No...
- Oh, my God.

04:33.024 --> 04:34.185
How do you like
them apples, huh?

04:34.208 --> 04:37.248
Aw, man, dude.

04:38.208 --> 04:40.000
Chris, will you marry us?

04:40.992 --> 04:43.424
- Now?
- Yeah.

04:43.456 --> 04:45.600
- Come on, come on.
- What?

04:45.632 --> 04:47.017
- Let's do it.
- Shouldn't we save it?

04:47.040 --> 04:49.312
Put your bags... babe,
we have the whole ceremony

04:49.344 --> 04:51.648
To make it official,
this is, like, between us,

04:51.680 --> 04:54.592
Friends, family,
it's all that matters, right?

04:54.624 --> 04:57.120
Yeah, but I just...

04:57.152 --> 04:59.337
- I wouldn't know what
to say, so. - Just put your...

04:59.360 --> 05:00.960
Screw it, I will help you.

05:00.992 --> 05:04.256
Yes, okay, yes, he's right.

05:08.512 --> 05:09.856
I'm sorry.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.809
- So, I say what...
- L-ladies and gentlemen,

05:12.832 --> 05:14.761
- we are gathered here today.
- Right

05:14.784 --> 05:16.192
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:16.224 --> 05:17.577
We are gathered here today
to celebrate

05:17.600 --> 05:20.224
The marriage
of Daniel and Alicia.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.040
Wedding is a sacred institution.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.088
Yeah, marriage
is a sacred institution

05:25.120 --> 05:26.976
And it should not be
taken lightly.

05:27.008 --> 05:29.225
And we're not, so let's
skip forward to the good part.

05:29.248 --> 05:32.512
So, Daniel, do you take Alicia?

05:33.728 --> 05:35.008
Daniel, do you take Alicia

05:35.040 --> 05:36.640
To be your lawfully wedded wife?

05:37.888 --> 05:40.704
For rich, poor, sick
and in good health

05:40.736 --> 05:42.496
So long as you both shall live?

05:42.528 --> 05:43.625
- I do.
- I do.

05:43.648 --> 05:46.272
This is stupid.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.776
- What?
- This is stupid,

05:47.808 --> 05:49.856
You know, I mean,
you guys are...

05:49.888 --> 05:53.568
Doing your thing and it makes me feel,
like, I just, I don't want to, okay?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.488
- What, what is wrong, man?
- Nothing, nothing.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.728
Nothing's wrong, I just, you
know, you guys have your fun,

05:57.760 --> 05:59.744
I got... I gotta set up camp

05:59.776 --> 06:02.176
And, you know,
we're losing light, so just...

06:17.248 --> 06:19.136
I know something's wrong.

06:20.576 --> 06:22.528
- And I wanna know what.
- Hmm?

06:23.680 --> 06:24.704
Chris.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.736
Nothing.

06:28.768 --> 06:30.944
I'm fine, it's nothing.

06:31.904 --> 06:33.408
- Okay.
- It's all good.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.896
Now, Chris, Chris, so, look,
I'm your best friend, okay?

06:36.928 --> 06:40.064
You don't think I know
when something's up your ass?

06:40.096 --> 06:42.048
Huh? Spill it.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.520
Yeah, all right, fine,

06:43.552 --> 06:45.472
There's something
that I gotta tell you.

06:45.504 --> 06:49.120
It's... I'm...
I'm sorry, okay?

06:50.368 --> 06:51.689
You know, you guys
are getting married

06:51.712 --> 06:54.688
- and I should be happy, but...
- But what?

06:54.720 --> 06:56.864
- Because I...
- So what, so... so, wh...

06:56.896 --> 06:58.816
No, no, no, no, no,
so, you think,

06:58.848 --> 07:01.760
You think we're gonna have
couples dinners without you?

07:01.792 --> 07:04.032
You think
we're gonna go antiquing

07:04.064 --> 07:06.624
And... and... and
rent a tandem bike

07:06.656 --> 07:09.472
And ride around town
in matching outfits?

07:10.432 --> 07:11.936
You asshole.

07:13.760 --> 07:17.440
And...
I'm gonna set you up...

07:17.472 --> 07:19.552
With so many hot girlfriends.

07:19.584 --> 07:23.072
So many hot girlfriends.
So many.

07:23.104 --> 07:26.016
I hate antiquing.
It's not happening.

07:26.048 --> 07:27.305
- All right.
- Okay,

07:27.328 --> 07:29.184
To my best man.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.272
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

07:39.104 --> 07:40.672
Whoa, wooo.

07:40.704 --> 07:41.664
Okay.

07:41.696 --> 07:43.040
- You okay?
- All right,

07:43.072 --> 07:45.312
There's a possibility
I may be drunk.

07:45.344 --> 07:47.968
Maybe just a little bit.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.880
- All right, bedtime. Come on.
- No, no, no, no, no.

07:50.912 --> 07:53.161
Guys, there's actually,
there's something I really do

07:53.184 --> 07:58.272
Need to tell you.
It's, um... um...

07:59.520 --> 08:02.272
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

08:02.304 --> 08:05.536
- Really?
- Yeah, really, so go ahead,

08:05.568 --> 08:07.840
Kiss the bride if you think
you got it in you.

08:08.992 --> 08:12.864
Well, I'm gonna attempt to.

08:15.584 --> 08:16.672
- Babe.
- Okay, I'm drunk,

08:16.704 --> 08:18.016
But I'm not that drunk.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.344
Da da

08:25.376 --> 08:27.584

08:27.616 --> 08:29.952
- Good-night, Chris.
- Good-night, buddy.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.384
See you in the morning, okay?

08:32.416 --> 08:33.535
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah.

08:33.568 --> 08:36.128
- Oh, thank God.
- Get in here.

08:39.583 --> 08:43.871
- Mm. Babe, what the heck?
- We gotta consummate our vows.

08:43.904 --> 08:46.400
- Close the thing.
- Ugh.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.384
Okay, it's closed.

08:58.432 --> 09:00.768
- He can hear us.
- We can be quiet.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.336
We can be quiet.

09:28.224 --> 09:29.920
Oh, fuck.

10:03.808 --> 10:07.424
- Hey, what are you doing, pal?
- Hey, whoa. Stop, help, help!

10:07.456 --> 10:10.240
You're stealing our stuff,
asshole.

10:10.272 --> 10:12.032
I'm not stealing.
I'm Devi.

10:12.064 --> 10:14.144
- Davie, who's Davie?
- Help!

10:14.176 --> 10:16.000
- Why you stealing?
- Not Davie, Devi!

10:16.032 --> 10:18.560
I'm friend of Alicia and Daniel.

10:18.592 --> 10:20.384
I'm park ranger, get out!

10:20.416 --> 10:22.976
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Devi!

10:23.008 --> 10:25.280
- He's going through your packs.
- What the hell happened?

10:25.312 --> 10:27.401
He's going through your packs,
he's stealing your stuff.

10:27.424 --> 10:29.216
Yeah, he was getting
my camera so I didn't have

10:29.248 --> 10:32.224
- To climb back up.
- I was gonna introduce you guys,

10:32.256 --> 10:33.888
But it looks like
you already met.

10:35.264 --> 10:37.248
Yo, I'm sorry.

10:37.280 --> 10:38.976
I'm sorry, man,
I'm... I'm Chris.

10:40.736 --> 10:42.880
Devi..

10:42.912 --> 10:45.056
- You okay?
- . I'm fine.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.656
- It's okay, Chris.
- Okay.

10:50.688 --> 10:52.224
- I would do same.
- Okay.

10:52.256 --> 10:53.920
All right.

10:55.264 --> 10:57.184
Devi works with us
at the red cross.

10:57.216 --> 10:58.304
First aid instructor.

10:58.336 --> 10:59.712
You can relax now, okay?

10:59.744 --> 11:01.152
No damage.

11:01.184 --> 11:02.880
Okay.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.024
Thank you.

11:05.056 --> 11:07.584
Come and take a snapshot,
three of you together.

11:07.616 --> 11:08.864
- Yeah.
- Nice background.

11:08.896 --> 11:10.505
- Okay, cool, yeah.
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

11:10.528 --> 11:12.512
Do you know how to work an sir?

11:12.544 --> 11:14.368
Of course.

11:14.400 --> 11:17.952
Let me just...
Let me do this.

11:17.984 --> 11:20.009
I had him, right?

11:20.032 --> 11:22.080
I mean, he got on top,
but I think I had it.

11:22.112 --> 11:23.872
- Yeah, easily.
- That was a reversal, yes.

11:23.904 --> 11:27.040
- So, go over there.
- Okay.

11:27.072 --> 11:28.137
He threw me in the air,

11:28.160 --> 11:29.161
I got up, just went after him.

11:29.184 --> 11:30.944
I had him.

11:30.976 --> 11:33.056
The sun's...
this way a few steps.

11:33.088 --> 11:35.680
- All right.
- Okay, a few more.

11:35.712 --> 11:36.777
- All right, yeah.
- It doesn't

11:36.800 --> 11:38.528
Have to be perfect.

11:39.648 --> 11:41.184
To the right a bit.

11:41.216 --> 11:42.592
- Right?
- Yes, right.

11:42.624 --> 11:45.120
- Our left.
- O-okay, is good.

11:45.152 --> 11:46.080
- Okay.
- So...

11:46.112 --> 11:48.128
Cheese.

11:48.160 --> 11:51.232
Last adjustments,
everyone move just small steps

11:51.264 --> 11:53.152
- to the right, okay?
- Okay.

11:53.184 --> 11:54.560
Ready?

11:54.592 --> 11:56.032
- Yup.
- Yeah, we've been ready, yeah.

11:56.064 --> 11:57.440
- Yeah.
- All right, that's good,

11:57.472 --> 11:59.296
That's good.

11:59.328 --> 12:00.800
- Been ready.
- Oh, my God.

12:03.104 --> 12:05.664
- You need help?
- No, stop.

12:05.696 --> 12:07.392
Nobody move.

12:07.424 --> 12:08.832
- There is a bomb-a.
- Bomba?

12:08.864 --> 12:10.217
- Bomb, you know?
- Chris, Chris, Chris,

12:10.240 --> 12:12.000
- freeze, freeze.
- Mine.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.057
No, no, no, Chris, you're
stepping on something, freeze.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.808
- Where?
- Just...

12:15.840 --> 12:17.481
- Okay. I'm not moving, I'm not...
- don't move, don't move.

12:17.504 --> 12:18.985
- What the hell's going on?
- Freeze your feet, Chris.

12:19.008 --> 12:20.544
- Okay.
- Or you will blow up.

12:20.576 --> 12:22.464
- What the fuck?
- No, no, he's... he's serious,

12:22.496 --> 12:23.881
- He's serious. - What, is
this some kind of fucking joke?

12:23.904 --> 12:25.673
- I think there is a landmine.
- Look, look, look.

12:25.696 --> 12:27.002
- Landmine?
- Yeah.

12:28.736 --> 12:31.936
- Where? - Here, it's
under his foot, he stepped on it.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.481
- Oh, my God, Chris.
- Dude, please,

12:33.504 --> 12:36.864
Just be perfectly still,
okay, don't move.

12:36.896 --> 12:38.656
Okay, what do I...
what do I do?

12:38.688 --> 12:40.201
Just breathe, okay,
we're gonna figure this out.

12:40.224 --> 12:42.121
- What the fuck do I do, Dan?
- Devi, what do we do?

12:42.144 --> 12:44.640
Don't panic. Nothing will
happen if you don't move.

12:44.672 --> 12:46.377
- Don't panic. - All
right, he's not moving.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.561
- Do you hear that, you hear that, Dan?
- Yes.

12:47.584 --> 12:48.713
He says not
to fucking panic, Dan.

12:48.736 --> 12:50.176
Listen, dude, just relax, okay?

12:50.208 --> 12:51.616
Chris, it's fine, it's fine.

12:51.648 --> 12:53.216
- Breathe, man.
- Okay, what do I... I...

12:53.248 --> 12:55.840
Chris, please don't move.

12:56.608 --> 12:59.136
Not even a millimeter, okay?

12:59.168 --> 13:00.841
Okay, okay, okay, look at
me, look at me, look at me.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.976
I'm here, man. I'm here.

13:04.768 --> 13:07.136
Okay, this is what we do.

13:07.168 --> 13:09.536
I will get help, but first...

13:10.688 --> 13:13.888
Get everyone else out of danger.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.224
We need get away from Chris.

13:16.256 --> 13:17.664
Far enough, for if...

13:17.696 --> 13:20.064
If anything happens to him,

13:20.096 --> 13:22.176
- I swear to God!
- Okay. Okay, okay.

13:22.208 --> 13:24.096
Okay, listen,
it's... it's fine.

13:24.128 --> 13:25.344
It's fine, okay, it's fine,

13:25.376 --> 13:27.200
Just how long...

13:27.232 --> 13:29.472
How long until you can get help?

13:29.504 --> 13:31.168
I don't know.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.888
Maybe four hours to get to town.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.736
Oh, my God.

13:36.768 --> 13:38.464
Four... four hours?

13:38.496 --> 13:40.736
I have to stand like this
for four hours?

13:40.768 --> 13:43.584
You must move away from Chris.

13:43.616 --> 13:46.464
All right, listen Devi,
don't lose time, okay?

13:46.496 --> 13:47.424
Go get help.

13:47.456 --> 13:49.216
Back.

13:49.248 --> 13:50.304
Get behind that rock.

13:50.336 --> 13:52.192
Fly, Devi, fucking fly.

13:52.224 --> 13:53.184
Okay.

13:54.944 --> 13:58.016
All right, look, I need you
to do something for me, okay?

13:58.048 --> 13:59.744
- What?
- I need you to promise me

13:59.776 --> 14:01.536
That you're gonna
go behind that rock.

14:01.568 --> 14:04.704
No matter what happens,
you're not gonna come out.

14:04.736 --> 14:06.208
What do you mean?
What's gonna happen?

14:06.240 --> 14:07.369
- Promise me, just...
- What the fuck

14:07.392 --> 14:08.928
- are you doing, man?
- But Daniel.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.232
Listen, this is something
I need to do, okay?

14:11.264 --> 14:13.984
Promise me.

14:14.016 --> 14:15.712
Say it, promise.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.744
- I promise.
- Okay.

14:22.048 --> 14:24.832
- I can't leave you alone, man.
- What?

14:24.864 --> 14:27.232
- It's... it's too dangerous.
- Doesn't matter.

14:27.264 --> 14:28.649
- Doesn't matter.
- Daniel, just come with me.

14:28.672 --> 14:30.025
Daniel, seriously,
you have to get out of here.

14:30.048 --> 14:32.096
Listen to me,
don't argue with me!

14:32.128 --> 14:35.136
I'm staying here, okay?
I'm staying here with Chris.

14:36.448 --> 14:37.856
Please.

14:44.416 --> 14:45.897
Seriously, you need... you really
need to get out of here, man.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.328
Oh, man,
I don't think so, buddy.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.713
Seriously,
get behind the fucking rock.

14:48.736 --> 14:50.304
It's not gonna happen.

14:50.336 --> 14:52.576
Dan, you're getting married
on Saturday, okay?

14:52.608 --> 14:54.368
Now, I can't let anything
happen to you.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.152
Listen to me, don't...
Don't worry about the wedding.

14:57.184 --> 14:59.264
I'm gonna get both of us
there, okay?

14:59.296 --> 15:01.312
You're my best man.

15:01.344 --> 15:03.232
You understand?

15:03.264 --> 15:05.664
I'm gonna get you
to the church on time.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.936
I'll get you there.

15:07.968 --> 15:10.048
I think it's supposed to be
the other way around.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.936
Right.

15:11.968 --> 15:15.104
Shit happens, right,
you just gotta roll with it.

15:15.136 --> 15:17.952
Yeah, yeah, shit happens.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.464
What's happening?

15:46.496 --> 15:47.456
How is he?

15:49.312 --> 15:50.848
He...

15:50.880 --> 15:52.992
It's okay, it's okay.

15:53.024 --> 15:54.656
What, what's wrong?

15:54.688 --> 15:56.544
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yeah, I'm okay.

15:59.264 --> 16:00.192
What the hell?

16:00.224 --> 16:01.792
We have a signal?

16:01.824 --> 16:03.200
It's just a text.

16:03.232 --> 16:05.184
Chris, we got a signal!

16:05.216 --> 16:07.264
It's gone, but we're
gonna climb to the top.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.272
Fly, Devi.

16:11.232 --> 16:12.288
Fly.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.064
Hi, hi, do you speak English?

16:16.096 --> 16:17.472
Oh, thank God.

16:17.504 --> 16:21.312
Yes, yes, yes,
we have an emergency.

16:21.344 --> 16:23.296
The mount...
Some mountains near...

16:23.328 --> 16:24.384
Birtvisi.

16:24.416 --> 16:27.392
Birtvisi.

16:27.424 --> 16:29.504
Yes, yes, our friend has stepped

16:29.536 --> 16:32.128
On an old landmine.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.856
Landmine!

16:33.888 --> 16:36.832
Yes yes, perfectly
still, okay, okay.

16:36.864 --> 16:39.296
We need a bomb squad, a chopper,

16:39.328 --> 16:41.952
Actually,
can you trace this call?

16:41.984 --> 16:44.736
GPS, GPS or something.

16:44.768 --> 16:47.296
Okay, I...
Completely, I understand.

16:47.328 --> 16:48.480
Thank you.

16:48.512 --> 16:49.737
She wants me
to tell you something.

16:49.760 --> 16:50.816
Me?

16:50.848 --> 16:52.384
Yeah, she says that they have

16:52.416 --> 16:54.432
An explosives expert
and a chopper on standby,

16:54.464 --> 16:55.561
She would send them,
but she's not going to.

16:55.584 --> 16:57.952
What, what, why?

16:57.984 --> 17:01.376
Yes, I'll tell her, thank you.

17:04.608 --> 17:07.455
She says they don't save whores.

17:07.488 --> 17:08.640
What?

17:14.271 --> 17:16.352
They don't save whores.

17:19.616 --> 17:22.240
And you're a filthy whore.

17:25.887 --> 17:28.223
Daniel...

17:28.256 --> 17:31.040
Daniel wait, where...

17:31.072 --> 17:34.400
Where are you going?

17:34.432 --> 17:36.704
Daniel, stop!

17:38.208 --> 17:39.392
Guys, guys, what happened,

17:39.424 --> 17:41.216
Did you call, what did they say?

17:41.248 --> 17:42.976
Alicia, you wanna tell him?

17:43.008 --> 17:44.832
What'd they say?

17:44.864 --> 17:48.704
Chris, what...
What did you tell Daniel?

17:48.736 --> 17:51.680
We had a real heart to heart.

17:51.712 --> 17:53.792
It was touching.

17:53.824 --> 17:54.752
Chris!

17:54.784 --> 17:56.448
I'm sorry...

17:56.480 --> 17:57.481
I had to, I told him everything,

17:57.504 --> 18:00.384
I had to, I'm sorry.

18:00.416 --> 18:02.112
Daniel, Daniel listen to me,

18:02.144 --> 18:04.544
We have to call emergency back.

18:04.576 --> 18:06.528
This is not the time.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.824
The time, this is not the time.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.272
Then when is the time, Alicia?

18:14.304 --> 18:18.912
I feel like this
conversation is way past due.

18:18.944 --> 18:20.736
I wanted to tell you.

18:20.768 --> 18:24.544
You have no idea how much
I wanted to tell you.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.640
But then you proposed.

18:30.592 --> 18:35.904
I didn't want anything
to ruin our life together.

18:35.936 --> 18:39.232
Please, please,
can't you understand that?

18:43.712 --> 18:46.368
I understand.

18:49.312 --> 18:52.512
Let's just, let's just go call.

18:52.544 --> 18:56.192
You see, there's something
you don't understand.

18:57.216 --> 18:59.808
There ain't no signal.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.760
Never was.

19:08.128 --> 19:10.592
I faked it.

19:10.624 --> 19:12.480
How does it feel?

19:12.512 --> 19:14.432
What the fuck, Daniel?!

19:14.464 --> 19:16.288
This is not funny!

19:16.320 --> 19:20.896
What, you don't see
the humor in this situation?

19:20.928 --> 19:23.168
All right, let me help you.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.792
Hey there, buddy ol' pal.

19:25.824 --> 19:28.192
Best friend.

19:28.224 --> 19:30.816
Best man.

19:30.848 --> 19:34.496
- I got a question for you.
- Daniel, what the fuck is going on...

19:34.528 --> 19:36.864
No, no, no, no,
me, hey, me first.

19:36.896 --> 19:39.072
Come on.

19:39.104 --> 19:41.024
What do you think
the statistical chances

19:41.056 --> 19:43.552
Are of you stepping
on a landmine?

19:43.584 --> 19:47.424
Listen, you're really freaking Alicia
out, okay, so let's just calm down...

19:47.456 --> 19:50.784
Answer the fucking question!

19:50.816 --> 19:52.576
What are the chances?

19:55.488 --> 19:56.585
I'd say the chances
are pretty low.

19:56.608 --> 19:57.824
And you'd be right.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.792
But here you are...

20:04.416 --> 20:09.216
Standing on a landmine,
totally screwed.

20:09.248 --> 20:10.912
How did you know that was there?

20:10.944 --> 20:13.696
'Cause it's right
where I left it.

20:13.728 --> 20:16.512
You want help?

20:16.544 --> 20:19.776
There it is.
I suggest you use it.

20:19.808 --> 20:20.937
What am I supposed
to do with that?

20:20.960 --> 20:24.608
You dig, bitch.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.456
Dig a trench
right beside of me, okay,

20:27.488 --> 20:31.360
And then real quick, you
jump in there like a bunny.

20:31.392 --> 20:35.808
Maybe you make it, maybe
your leg gets blown off.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.272
Or maybe the trench
that she digs

20:38.304 --> 20:40.640
Ends up being
your grave or something.

20:42.528 --> 20:44.064
You planned this whole thing.

20:44.096 --> 20:46.304
No, no, Devi planned it,

20:46.336 --> 20:48.480
But the pleasure is all mine.

20:51.648 --> 20:53.632
Daniel...

20:53.664 --> 20:55.584
Why are you doing this?

20:55.616 --> 20:59.840
Love of my life,
the woman I wanted to marry.

21:02.368 --> 21:04.224
You still don't understand.

21:06.144 --> 21:07.392
Understand what?

21:07.424 --> 21:08.800
It's not what I'm doing,

21:08.832 --> 21:10.912
It's what I've already done.

21:13.568 --> 21:15.616
This is bullshit.

21:15.648 --> 21:18.432
This is bullshit, there's no...

21:18.464 --> 21:22.368
- There's no mine.
- Wanna bet your life?

21:22.400 --> 21:24.681
You wouldn't risk it. You've been
standing next to me the whole time,

21:24.704 --> 21:26.272
What if I accidentally
moved my foot?

21:26.304 --> 21:30.016
That's true.

21:30.048 --> 21:36.512
There's no way I'm actually
standing on an armed mine.

21:36.544 --> 21:38.560
You are now, Jagoff.

21:38.592 --> 21:41.152
That right there
is an east German model

21:41.184 --> 21:43.968
SMI-35 landmine.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.088
And it ain't no dud.

21:49.408 --> 21:52.992
If you ever loved me, stop.

21:53.024 --> 21:55.168
It's too late.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.512
I can't.

21:56.544 --> 21:57.734
I couldn't even if I wanted to,

21:57.760 --> 22:00.864
But I really, really don't.

22:00.896 --> 22:02.624
Daniel, Daniel, I fucked up,

22:02.656 --> 22:04.288
Okay, I know I fucked up,

22:04.320 --> 22:07.488
But for God's sake,
man, don't do this!

22:07.520 --> 22:09.184
I already did.

22:09.216 --> 22:11.296
You already did, man.

22:11.328 --> 22:13.696
You think you stepped
on a landmine today?

22:13.728 --> 22:15.081
Let me tell you
something, buddy boy,

22:15.104 --> 22:16.256
You stepped on a landmine

22:16.288 --> 22:19.392
When you decided
to fuck my girl!

22:21.760 --> 22:23.712
You know what,
put the pin back in.

22:23.744 --> 22:25.353
Daniel, put the pin back in
and we can talk about it.

22:25.376 --> 22:26.848
Do you, oh, do you want the pin?

22:26.880 --> 22:28.876
- Do you want the pin?
- Put the pin back in!

22:30.304 --> 22:33.216
Daniel, where...

22:33.248 --> 22:34.752
Where are you going?

22:34.784 --> 22:37.856
I wish I could
be here to see what happens,

22:37.888 --> 22:39.968
But I bet the ending's
gonna be explosive.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.600
Do you have any idea
what you're doing?

22:41.632 --> 22:43.872
Adios, lovebirds!

22:43.904 --> 22:47.424
Wait, no, you can't go.

22:47.456 --> 22:50.432
Don't...
Don't leave like this.

22:50.464 --> 22:52.544
Listen to me, what happened

22:52.576 --> 22:56.832
Between me
and Chris was a mistake.

22:58.272 --> 23:00.224
I love you!

23:00.256 --> 23:04.512
We're getting married, this has
nothing to do with our future.

23:04.544 --> 23:05.792
Baby...

23:05.824 --> 23:09.824
Now is not the time
to be sentimental, okay?

23:09.856 --> 23:12.448
Now's the time to dig.

23:23.904 --> 23:25.216
Alicia, don't come any closer.

23:25.248 --> 23:26.249
Stop, don't come any closer.

23:26.272 --> 23:28.512
How are you?

23:28.544 --> 23:29.824
I'm fucked.

23:29.856 --> 23:31.936
That motherfucker's
gonna pay for this!

23:31.968 --> 23:33.760
It's murder!

23:35.808 --> 23:38.112
Oh, fuck.

23:38.144 --> 23:42.336
No, we're gonna figure
this out, I just...

23:42.368 --> 23:44.384
I just meant in legal terms.

23:44.416 --> 23:46.976
That's okay. Uh, Alicia,
could you do me a favor,

23:47.008 --> 23:50.976
Could you... could you go stand
behind the rock, please?

23:52.128 --> 23:54.016
Behind the rock?

23:54.048 --> 23:58.048
Daniel's trying to kill you
and you want me to hide?

23:58.080 --> 24:00.800
I just want you to stay safe.
I need you to be safe

24:00.832 --> 24:03.808
While we figure this thing out.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.984
What if...

24:06.016 --> 24:07.488
What if we switch?

24:12.800 --> 24:16.192
Devi!

24:16.224 --> 24:17.696
Devi!

24:17.728 --> 24:20.672
Hey.

24:20.704 --> 24:22.368
Check it out.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.416
We have the front row seats.

24:24.448 --> 24:27.328
Yeah, man, I say we split.

24:27.360 --> 24:28.512
Now?

24:28.544 --> 24:30.240
Yeah, why not?

24:30.272 --> 24:33.792
I thought we gonna
watch, maybe one hour.

24:33.824 --> 24:35.968
Then we help her.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.129
Yeah, man,
let them figure it out,

24:37.152 --> 24:40.064
They deserve each other.

24:40.096 --> 24:41.952
We'll miss the fun.

24:41.984 --> 24:43.648
You know what's fun?

24:43.680 --> 24:47.392
Beer, strippers,
strippers and beer.

24:47.424 --> 24:49.792
Ha, are you sure?

24:49.824 --> 24:52.288
Yeah.

24:52.320 --> 24:55.616
Okay, but first...

24:55.648 --> 25:00.960
We'll go to

25:00.992 --> 25:03.712
I want a big plate of Khinkali.

25:03.744 --> 25:06.144
Khinkali?
Come on, man.

25:06.176 --> 25:08.096
Come on up here.

25:13.248 --> 25:14.377
I'll tell you what,
only Georgians

25:14.400 --> 25:17.344
Take food before girls.

25:17.376 --> 25:19.968
Correct, my brother,
it's hungry war.

25:21.312 --> 25:23.200
I got it!

25:23.232 --> 25:24.832
- I got it.
- You got it?

25:24.864 --> 25:26.624
Oh, thank God.

25:26.656 --> 25:27.881
Just, uh... throw it,
throw it over.

25:27.904 --> 25:30.144
I'm not coming over
until you say so,

25:30.176 --> 25:31.712
But you're gonna
have to let me do it.

25:31.744 --> 25:33.600
- No, absolutely not.
- You have to let me do it,

25:33.632 --> 25:34.953
Chris, you're gonna shift
your weight too much,

25:34.976 --> 25:37.856
I mean it's under
your foot, can you see it?

25:40.416 --> 25:42.048
No.

25:42.080 --> 25:45.280
- So just say the word.
- I can't.

25:47.456 --> 25:50.880
Yeah, okay, all right,
yeah, you're good.

25:50.912 --> 25:53.984
Okay just, Alicia, look
at me, just be careful.

25:54.016 --> 25:55.552
Okay, let's just go real slow.

25:55.584 --> 25:58.592
Be easy and then
we're gonna put it in fast,

25:58.624 --> 26:00.512
We're gonna
take it out fast, okay?

26:04.064 --> 26:05.472
Be careful.

26:05.504 --> 26:08.832
Maybe this chain is in the way.

26:08.864 --> 26:12.256
Here, use mine.

26:12.288 --> 26:15.808
Okay.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.824
I'm gonna get off this thing.

26:24.416 --> 26:29.024
All right,
rock and roll, here we go.

26:29.056 --> 26:30.624
So I...

26:30.656 --> 26:32.096
I know you have to say this

26:32.128 --> 26:33.225
When you're having
sex with Daniel,

26:33.248 --> 26:34.496
But is it in yet?

26:34.528 --> 26:38.080
I don't know, it's...

26:38.112 --> 26:39.840
It's stuck, just...

26:39.872 --> 26:41.193
What do you mean,
it's a simple mechanism,

26:41.216 --> 26:42.825
Just plug it in and it'll
disarm and we're good.

26:42.848 --> 26:45.728
I'm not so sure about that.

26:45.760 --> 26:47.904
Is it in or not, how can you
not be sure if it's in?

26:47.936 --> 26:49.824
How do you not... it's in
a little, but I can't...

26:49.856 --> 26:51.209
It's in a little, what the
fuck does that mean, Alicia,

26:51.232 --> 26:52.288
What the hell's going on?

26:52.320 --> 26:53.600
What do you want me to do?

26:55.392 --> 26:57.184
I'm so fucked.

26:57.216 --> 26:59.232
Oh my God, I'm so fucked.

26:59.264 --> 27:01.312
You know what, let me just...

27:01.344 --> 27:03.232
I'm totally, I'm totally fucked.

27:03.264 --> 27:05.792
I'm gonna leave it in.

27:05.824 --> 27:07.104
Leave it in, so it's in?

27:07.136 --> 27:09.664
So I'm good, I can step off now?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.936
No, it can't be
trusted for that.

27:11.968 --> 27:13.792
If you could see it,
you would understand.

27:13.824 --> 27:15.552
No, fuck that, if it's in then

27:15.584 --> 27:17.120
I'm gonna go for it,
I'm gonna step off.

27:17.152 --> 27:19.584
No, it can't, it's not,
we can't be sure!

27:19.616 --> 27:21.801
No, if it's in, then I'm sure, I'm just...
I'm gonna go for it,

27:21.824 --> 27:24.105
- So get behind the rock and... -oh
you're sure, you're fucking sure,

27:24.128 --> 27:26.784
Is that why I should
get behind the rock?

27:26.816 --> 27:27.817
Fuck you, Daniel,
fuck you, Daniel!

27:27.840 --> 27:29.088
Listen to me!

27:29.120 --> 27:31.008
We got the smoke signal,
someone's gonna see it,

27:31.040 --> 27:33.920
We got the pin in,
so it should be disarmed,

27:33.952 --> 27:35.744
But we don't know
for sure and it's

27:35.776 --> 27:40.160
Not exactly worth
taking chances, right?

27:40.192 --> 27:43.168
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.425
We need all the
odds in our favor,

27:44.448 --> 27:47.040
So I know what we have to do.

27:47.072 --> 27:48.416
What?

27:48.448 --> 27:49.952
What Daniel said.

27:49.984 --> 27:51.072
What'd he say?

27:51.104 --> 27:52.800
Dig.

27:52.832 --> 27:55.488
Bitch.

28:32.064 --> 28:34.816
Help! Help!

28:34.848 --> 28:36.169
Help, help!

28:36.192 --> 28:38.080
Is anybody there, help!

28:38.112 --> 28:39.744
Hello!

28:39.776 --> 28:41.193
Oh, shit!

28:41.216 --> 28:43.808
No, no, stay back, stay back!

28:47.872 --> 28:51.456
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
do you speak English?

28:51.488 --> 28:52.736
Please, please,
put the gun down.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.233
Why would you hurt the dog huh?

28:56.256 --> 28:57.184
No, put the gun down,

28:57.216 --> 28:58.272
I was just trying to...

28:58.304 --> 29:00.448
Why would you hurt the dog?

29:00.480 --> 29:03.552
You don't understand, my friend,
he stepped on a... on a landmine!

29:03.584 --> 29:05.024
- You, turn around!
- He can't...

29:05.056 --> 29:06.537
- Show me your hands!
- No, you don't understand.

29:06.560 --> 29:07.744
I said, show me your hands!

29:07.776 --> 29:09.760
He can't move!

29:09.792 --> 29:11.968
Please!

29:12.000 --> 29:14.304
- Where's the body?
- Body, what are you talking about?

29:14.336 --> 29:16.416
- You bury body here!
- There's no body,

29:16.448 --> 29:18.281
I don't know what you're talking
about, just put the fucking gun away.

29:18.304 --> 29:20.256
You, come here.
He can't move!

29:20.288 --> 29:21.417
- Put your hands on your head!
- He can't...

29:21.440 --> 29:22.784
I can't... I can't move,

29:22.816 --> 29:24.122
Stop being a fucking
asshole, dude!

29:25.248 --> 29:26.688
Shit!

29:29.888 --> 29:32.736
Please, listen to me,

29:32.768 --> 29:35.648
He is standing on a bomb.

29:35.680 --> 29:39.104
If he moves, we all die.

29:39.136 --> 29:41.152
Do you understand?

29:50.048 --> 29:51.712
Is a bomb.

29:51.744 --> 29:54.752
Yeah, please, keep the dog back.

29:54.784 --> 29:58.688
, there's really a bomb.

29:58.720 --> 30:00.256
Yeah, that's
why I can't move, man,

30:00.288 --> 30:04.992
So just put the gun away,
stop being an idiot.

30:05.024 --> 30:06.528
You're standing on a bomb

30:06.560 --> 30:08.224
And I'm the idiot?

30:08.256 --> 30:09.984
Listen, we're
running out of time,

30:10.016 --> 30:13.088
We need help.

30:15.008 --> 30:15.968
He's your husband?

30:16.000 --> 30:19.392
No, he's my friend.

30:19.424 --> 30:22.016
- And why are you alone with no husband?
- What the hell

30:22.048 --> 30:25.664
- Difference does that make?
- I wasn't, the others left.

30:27.424 --> 30:30.016
Your husband left to get help?

30:30.048 --> 30:32.608
He left to...
It doesn't matter,

30:32.640 --> 30:34.336
Chris can't stay
like this much longer.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.512
How?

30:44.544 --> 30:45.888
How what?

30:45.920 --> 30:46.976
How help?

30:52.128 --> 30:54.400
I know I'm asking for a lot.

30:54.432 --> 30:56.160
I mean it's really dangerous,

30:56.192 --> 30:58.336
But will you help me dig?

30:58.368 --> 31:00.096
Dig?

31:00.128 --> 31:03.104
Yeah, the trench,
it's not deep enough.

31:03.136 --> 31:04.960
Deep enough for what?

31:04.992 --> 31:07.104
We're gonna try to...

31:07.136 --> 31:09.312
Chris is gonna try to jump in.

31:17.152 --> 31:18.432
I'm serious, I know it's not

31:18.464 --> 31:20.896
A great idea,
but it's the best we've got.

31:24.192 --> 31:26.304
What the hell are you laughing at?
This is not funny.

31:26.336 --> 31:27.808
He must stay still, yes?

31:27.840 --> 31:29.664
Yes, perfectly still.

31:29.696 --> 31:32.064
And you digging for him, yes?

31:32.096 --> 31:34.912
Yeah, so will you help?

31:34.944 --> 31:37.280
You make all the job
when she do nothing.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.520
You make perfect Georgian wife.

31:39.552 --> 31:40.768
Isn't it funny?

31:40.800 --> 31:42.336
That's real funny.

31:46.144 --> 31:47.776
Come here, girl.

31:47.808 --> 31:49.120
Give me the shovel.

31:49.152 --> 31:51.264
This is not a joke.

31:51.296 --> 31:52.512
I'll help.

31:59.040 --> 32:02.176
Chris, come on,
I am sorry for gun accident.

32:02.208 --> 32:04.384
No really, I certain you
were burying the body.

32:06.528 --> 32:08.352
That's fine.

32:08.384 --> 32:10.208
I'm sure it must have
looked a little strange.

32:11.424 --> 32:12.864
You want water?

32:12.896 --> 32:15.584
Yes, please.

32:32.064 --> 32:34.304
- Ow, what the fuck, man?
- What, what happened?

32:34.336 --> 32:36.201
- Sorry, okay, sorry.
- He just threw a rock at me,

32:36.224 --> 32:38.688
- You piece of shit! -
What, are you fucking crazy?

32:38.720 --> 32:40.640
No, why you say
that to me, why...

32:40.672 --> 32:42.656
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let go of her!

32:42.688 --> 32:43.680
Why you say that to me?

32:43.712 --> 32:44.800
Why you say that I'm crazy?

32:44.832 --> 32:45.961
I told you my friend can't move

32:45.984 --> 32:47.680
And you just threw
a rock at him.

32:47.712 --> 32:49.472
Yes, okay, but because I test

32:49.504 --> 32:52.224
If he's really a bomb that
you make no joke of me.

32:52.256 --> 32:53.353
Why the hell would we joke

32:53.376 --> 32:55.296
About something like that?

32:55.328 --> 32:56.448
I came here many years

32:56.480 --> 32:58.048
And never hear about bombs.

32:58.080 --> 32:59.328
I know, it's a long story,

32:59.360 --> 33:02.016
Just right now
we need to dig the trench.

33:03.360 --> 33:05.088
What story?

33:05.120 --> 33:07.520
It doesn't matter,
just please help.

33:07.552 --> 33:10.944
I want to know.

33:10.976 --> 33:14.272
- My boyfriend set this up.
- Why?

33:14.304 --> 33:15.561
It's none of your
damn business, let go of her.

33:15.584 --> 33:16.608
It's personal.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.400
That's not my business?

33:18.432 --> 33:20.416
Let go of her.

33:20.448 --> 33:23.392
Oh, sorry, I forget
that I'm holding your hand.

33:23.424 --> 33:25.184
I want to know why.

33:25.216 --> 33:26.688
I want to know personal.

33:31.616 --> 33:33.504
He did this to get back at us...

33:33.536 --> 33:35.360
Oh, sorry,
uh-huh.

33:35.392 --> 33:38.240
We hurt him,
this is his revenge.

33:38.272 --> 33:41.216
- What have you done to him? -
Jesus Christ, man, can you just help?

33:44.512 --> 33:46.080
You know what?

33:46.112 --> 33:48.128
I go if you no answer.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.176
He was my fiancee,
this is his best friend,

33:50.208 --> 33:53.600
We slept together.

33:53.632 --> 33:56.832
Oh, I understand.

33:56.864 --> 33:59.392
You are whore.

33:59.424 --> 34:01.568
Watch your mouth, buddy.
My mouth?

34:01.600 --> 34:03.360
Yeah, watch your fucking mouth.

34:03.392 --> 34:04.553
You don't talk
to a lady like that.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.464
Like what?

34:06.496 --> 34:08.063
Fuck off.

34:08.096 --> 34:10.016
If you don't want to help,
don't waste our time.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.224
I want help, but you say
to me "fuck off."

34:12.255 --> 34:14.016
You know what, if you say to me

34:14.047 --> 34:16.032
One more time "fuck off," I go,

34:16.063 --> 34:18.527
I don't help, I swear.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.928
Man, I want to help really,

34:20.960 --> 34:22.464
But how can I help if you

34:22.496 --> 34:24.288
Say to me "fuck off?!"

34:29.472 --> 34:33.504
So...

34:33.536 --> 34:35.040
Guys, I don't understand,

34:35.072 --> 34:36.896
You want me go or help?

34:36.928 --> 34:39.744
- Help.
- See Chris, she wants me to stay.

34:39.775 --> 34:42.016
She doesn't want you to stay,
she wants you to help.

34:43.871 --> 34:49.536
Okay, okay, if I help...

34:49.568 --> 34:52.224
What I get?

34:52.255 --> 34:55.199
You want our stuff?

36:53.472 --> 36:58.912
But I don't

36:58.944 --> 37:02.752
I don't want American dollars.

37:02.784 --> 37:05.056
I want...

37:08.576 --> 37:09.920
This.

37:18.144 --> 37:20.480
You son of a bitch!

37:22.112 --> 37:26.080
You respect my mother,
or I will hurt.

37:28.064 --> 37:31.776
Give and I help,
don't give and I leave.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.248
Fine.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.401
- Fine, I'll give to you.

37:39.424 --> 37:40.745

37:40.768 --> 37:43.648
Where do you think
this is gonna go?

37:43.680 --> 37:46.432
Nowhere, it's just

37:46.464 --> 37:49.856
Uh, uh, uh, uh, where you go?

37:52.224 --> 37:53.984
To my tent to take them off.

37:54.016 --> 37:57.344
No, you give here.

38:00.768 --> 38:02.848

38:02.880 --> 38:04.745
All right, listen here, asshole,
our friends are coming back

38:04.768 --> 38:08.032
With help, okay? They left to get
help and they're coming back.

38:08.064 --> 38:09.513
- Friends.
- Yeah, yeah, they're coming back

38:09.536 --> 38:11.424
With cops and a bomb expert,

38:11.456 --> 38:13.984
And a whole fucking
SWAT team, okay?

38:14.016 --> 38:16.064
Come on, Chris, no.

38:16.096 --> 38:18.208
Friends no coming.

38:18.240 --> 38:19.840
That's why she dig

38:19.872 --> 38:22.816
And that's why
you want me to help.

38:22.848 --> 38:27.264
And I wanted to help, but
for this, I want this.

38:27.296 --> 38:29.568
Listen, you think
whatever you want,

38:29.600 --> 38:31.360
All right, but they're
coming, okay?

38:31.392 --> 38:32.361
If I were you, I'd get
the hell out of here

38:32.384 --> 38:33.824
Before I went to jail.

38:33.856 --> 38:35.776
Jail? Why?

38:35.808 --> 38:38.016
You ask me to help and I help,

38:38.048 --> 38:39.744
But for this I get...

38:39.776 --> 38:41.632
What I get?

38:41.664 --> 38:42.761
You said I get American dollars,

38:42.784 --> 38:44.608
But I don't want
American dollars,

38:44.640 --> 38:46.592
I want this,

38:46.624 --> 38:47.872
I help, you pay.

38:47.904 --> 38:50.112
No pay, no help.

38:50.144 --> 38:51.744
Why jail, what did I do?

38:51.776 --> 38:53.216
Motherfucker.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.688
I said...
Respect my mother!

38:54.720 --> 38:57.120
Stop, stop,
I'll do it, I'll do it!

38:57.152 --> 38:59.840
- Don't touch him.
- Okay, I don't want to touch him,

38:59.872 --> 39:01.696
I want to help you,
you understand?

39:01.728 --> 39:03.328
I want to be nice for you

39:03.360 --> 39:05.920
And I want to help,
but for this you must pay

39:05.952 --> 39:08.928
And this is normal,
this is logic.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.561
- Come on, girl, I don't look. -
No, don't fucking do it, Alicia, okay?

39:11.584 --> 39:13.161
- I'm... I'm gonna take care of this guy...
- It's fine,

39:13.184 --> 39:14.793
- he can have it.
- No, he can't have it,

39:14.816 --> 39:16.713
I'm stepping off, get away
from me, no, Chris, don't!

39:16.736 --> 39:18.505
- The pin's gonna hold, I'm gonna step off.
- Don't, you can't!

39:18.528 --> 39:20.265
I'm gonna step off! And kick
this fucking guy's ass,

39:20.288 --> 39:22.976
- you piece of shit!
- I lied!

39:23.008 --> 39:24.384
I lied about the pin.

39:27.040 --> 39:28.672
You lied, why would you do that?

39:28.704 --> 39:31.392
It's... it's useless!

39:31.424 --> 39:33.696
You were freaking out,
I was trying to calm you down.

39:35.392 --> 39:36.617
Alicia, I could've
fucking died right now,

39:36.640 --> 39:38.144
- are you serious?
- You didn't,

39:38.176 --> 39:39.808
And you're not going to.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.528
All right, I'm handling this.

39:42.560 --> 39:45.440
I'm doing this.

39:45.472 --> 39:47.072
Shut the fuck up.

40:17.888 --> 40:21.440
We're doing this, right?

40:21.472 --> 40:24.608
Change, hand to hand, right.

40:24.640 --> 40:25.641
- Thank you. - All
right, you got what you want,

40:25.664 --> 40:27.648
- now fucking leave.
- No!

40:27.680 --> 40:29.440
No, I don't leave, I help.

40:32.608 --> 40:34.240
He's not going anywhere.

40:38.336 --> 40:40.000
We had a deal,
now start digging!

40:40.032 --> 40:41.161
Yes, you're the boss, of course,

40:41.184 --> 40:43.168
I'm going digging.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.376
One, two, one, two...

40:47.936 --> 40:49.408
Alicia, can you come over

40:49.440 --> 40:51.584
And explain what exactly

40:51.616 --> 40:53.120
You want me to do, huh?

40:53.152 --> 40:55.232
Well it needs to be a lot deeper

40:55.264 --> 40:57.216
And at least another
two feet back.

41:02.944 --> 41:04.832
Of course, of course, I dig.

41:04.864 --> 41:07.680
Of course I dig.

41:19.904 --> 41:22.976
I dig.

41:24.288 --> 41:26.144
It's gotta be a lot deeper.

41:26.176 --> 41:27.872
How do you like
the view of my ass?

41:27.904 --> 41:30.016
- Fucker.
- Shut up, Chris.

41:34.976 --> 41:36.608
You have a radio?

41:39.296 --> 41:41.952
I don't believe it.

41:42.944 --> 41:45.344
Shh...

41:47.936 --> 41:49.664
See, my soup is ready.

41:49.696 --> 41:51.200
I keep promise, I don't go

41:51.232 --> 41:56.832
To my lovely soup
and I stay here to dig.

41:56.864 --> 41:59.712
No, you know what,
it's just, let me use that.

41:59.744 --> 42:01.632
You had the radio
the whole time?

42:01.664 --> 42:05.056
You had a radio
the whole fucking time?

42:05.088 --> 42:06.441
Yes, you like it?

42:06.464 --> 42:08.320
Yes, yes, I like it,
now can we use it please?

42:08.352 --> 42:10.080
Yeah, you don't
even have to dig,

42:10.112 --> 42:12.448
Just let me...
Just let me call.

42:12.480 --> 42:13.920
What?

42:13.952 --> 42:15.264
Call?

42:15.296 --> 42:16.896
- Yeah.
- Why?

42:16.928 --> 42:17.920
So we can call for help.

42:17.952 --> 42:18.944
You don't like my help?

42:18.976 --> 42:20.105
Yeah, your help is fucking fine,

42:20.128 --> 42:22.496
But can we use it to call 911?

42:22.528 --> 42:25.856
But we don't have 911.
We have 112.

42:25.888 --> 42:28.608
I don't give a shit what you
have, fucking call it already.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.016
So you don't like my help?

42:30.048 --> 42:32.320
Okay, fine, I don't help!

42:32.352 --> 42:34.144
I go!

42:34.176 --> 42:36.704
No no, we just
don't need you to dig,

42:36.736 --> 42:39.168
We need to call emergency.

42:39.200 --> 42:41.984
- No.
- Why not?

42:42.016 --> 42:47.744
Because if I call 112,
what you do for me?

42:47.776 --> 42:49.696
Huh?

42:49.728 --> 42:51.657
You gotta be kidding me,
we don't have time for this.

42:51.680 --> 42:54.144
Chris is in danger,
don't you understand?

42:54.176 --> 42:56.416
Just fucking call 112!

42:56.448 --> 42:58.912
If I call 112, what you do?

43:03.168 --> 43:06.688
Look guys, I tried to be nice,

43:06.720 --> 43:08.032

- Okay.

43:08.064 --> 43:09.600
I do everything, but you...

43:09.632 --> 43:13.312
You aren't nice to me
and I don't like this,

43:13.344 --> 43:14.464
I really don't like this.

43:14.496 --> 43:16.704
Okay, okay, okay, now listen,

43:16.736 --> 43:19.328

43:19.360 --> 43:23.456
Can we use that
to call emergency?

43:23.488 --> 43:25.632
Oh my God, oh my God.

43:25.664 --> 43:27.744
- Don't fucking touch her.
- Yes, of course.

43:27.776 --> 43:29.696
Yes of course!

43:29.728 --> 43:32.000
Man, what's wrong with you?

44:14.400 --> 44:15.721
I promise when I get off
this landmine,

44:15.744 --> 44:18.432
I'm gonna fuck your world up.

44:25.184 --> 44:27.488
Look at me, you fuck!

44:27.520 --> 44:29.152
Stop touching your dog
and look at me.

44:31.392 --> 44:33.312
You got a thing for the
dog, is that what it is?

47:14.752 --> 47:16.736
What game?

47:16.768 --> 47:19.968
Undressing.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.472
- Sorry.
- What?

47:21.504 --> 47:27.008
I translate for him,
you undress now.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.233
Alicia, there's no
way he's helping.

47:28.256 --> 47:31.968
I'm not playing this game!

47:32.000 --> 47:33.856
You can leave.

47:36.832 --> 47:39.232
Okay.

47:39.264 --> 47:41.120
It's your choice,
can I have this?

47:57.664 --> 48:00.800
Hey!

48:00.832 --> 48:03.392
My friend Sergi, he's worried

48:03.424 --> 48:04.992
And that's no good, believe me

48:05.024 --> 48:08.000
That's no good.

48:08.032 --> 48:10.496
What we do?

48:10.528 --> 48:12.425
He prepares soup for me but I
don't go and I still here.

48:12.448 --> 48:14.016
I don't care, go eat your soup.

48:14.048 --> 48:16.224
But I don't want soup,
I want my friend Sergi

48:16.256 --> 48:21.440
Don't worry because...
Because he has health problems

48:21.472 --> 48:23.616
And if he die,
that's your problem.

48:23.648 --> 48:25.760
Hey, leave her alone!
Let go of me!

48:25.792 --> 48:28.448
- Let go of her!
- Take radio, take it, and answer him

48:28.480 --> 48:30.304
And tell him don't worry.

48:30.336 --> 48:32.960
Tell him he don't worry anymore.
Tell him.

48:35.200 --> 48:37.152
Sergi, don't worry,
Ilya is fine.

48:39.072 --> 48:42.080
Ilya is fine, "Prium."

48:43.968 --> 48:48.800
He don't understand,
explain him, explain him!

48:48.832 --> 48:49.833
- Sergi, don't worry.
- She's trying,

48:49.856 --> 48:51.296
You fucking idiot!

48:51.328 --> 48:54.080
Ilya is fine, "Prium!"

48:56.128 --> 48:59.168
Explain, he don't understand,
explain to him, explain.

48:59.200 --> 49:01.248
- He doesn't speak English!
- I don't want...

49:01.280 --> 49:04.768
I don't want to hurt you, explain
him, I said explain him!

49:04.800 --> 49:06.208
Ilya is fine, "Prium!"

49:06.240 --> 49:07.168
He doesn't speak English,

49:07.200 --> 49:08.800
You fucking retard!

49:08.832 --> 49:10.592
Can't you fucking
understand that?

49:10.624 --> 49:11.872
So you want me to translate,

49:11.904 --> 49:15.808
Okay, I translate, but for this

49:15.840 --> 49:17.984
You must undress,
this is the rule,

49:18.016 --> 49:20.416
Just the rule, nothing!

49:20.448 --> 49:24.000
Okay, okay, okay!

49:26.752 --> 49:28.544
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, come on,

49:28.576 --> 49:31.744
Come on, listen,
girlie, it's okay

49:31.776 --> 49:33.472
To look how you are undressing,

49:33.504 --> 49:37.376
But most important is rule.

49:37.408 --> 49:39.072
First of all, I must translate

49:39.104 --> 49:41.344
And then you undress.

49:41.376 --> 49:42.432
Did you get it?

49:42.464 --> 49:44.832
I translate, you undress.

49:44.864 --> 49:47.200
Is it okay?

49:47.232 --> 49:51.072
Fine, what you want
me to translate?

49:51.104 --> 49:53.888
Tell him you're all right.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.680
Okay.

49:59.456 --> 50:04.288
Sergi,.

50:11.232 --> 50:13.696
He ask what it means

50:13.728 --> 50:15.584
"Tell him that you're
all right."

50:17.024 --> 50:18.432
What?

50:18.464 --> 50:19.744
He translated word for word.

50:19.776 --> 50:22.464
Okay, all right,
now you translate me.

50:22.496 --> 50:26.112
Okay, but I translated already.

50:26.144 --> 50:29.664
- Now it's her turn, so undress.
- No, it doesn't count.

50:29.696 --> 50:31.584
- Yes, it counts.
- Nope, you're a liar.

50:31.616 --> 50:33.504
What, why you say that to me?

50:33.536 --> 50:35.296
Because you didn't
explain the rules

50:35.328 --> 50:36.960
And that's the same as lying.

50:36.992 --> 50:39.040
Now are you a liar?

50:39.072 --> 50:40.672
No!

50:40.704 --> 50:44.864
Okay, okay, okay,
let's start once more, okay?

50:44.896 --> 50:47.552
But first of all,
I explain the rules.

50:47.584 --> 50:49.664
Do you agree, Chris?

50:49.696 --> 50:51.584
- Let's play.
- Okay.

50:51.616 --> 50:54.144
So translate me.

50:54.176 --> 50:56.416
Come on.

50:56.448 --> 51:01.696
"It's me, Ilya,
I'm fine, don't worry."

51:01.728 --> 51:05.216
Sergi,.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.504
He asks me if I am joking

51:13.536 --> 51:18.144
And who am I with.

51:18.176 --> 51:23.488
Come on, undress.

51:23.520 --> 51:26.304
Okay.

51:26.336 --> 51:28.512
Good, but what answer?

51:28.544 --> 51:30.144
We don't answer.

51:30.176 --> 51:33.440
But he ask the question
and I must answer.

51:33.472 --> 51:34.857
Did you remember
he has head problems,

51:34.880 --> 51:36.672
So I must answer.

51:36.704 --> 51:37.792
He's not worried anymore,

51:37.824 --> 51:39.072
He thinks you're joking.

51:39.104 --> 51:40.320
But I'm not joking!

51:40.352 --> 51:42.304
What I answer!

51:42.336 --> 51:43.424
You got what you want,

51:43.456 --> 51:45.856
So answer what you want!

51:45.888 --> 51:50.368
"Everything is okay..."

51:50.400 --> 51:54.880
I just met some tourists.

51:54.912 --> 51:57.024
"Battery is dying."

51:57.056 --> 51:59.008
Okay.

51:59.040 --> 52:01.632
"Coming back now."

52:01.664 --> 52:03.296
Okay.

52:03.328 --> 52:06.240
Sergi,

52:18.016 --> 52:19.680
Come on.

52:25.472 --> 52:29.088
Okay, game over.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.944
Leave.

52:30.976 --> 52:32.480
Smart girl.

52:40.032 --> 52:42.016
- Go.
- Yes.

52:55.072 --> 52:56.864
It's okay.

53:02.176 --> 53:04.768
Hey, Alicia, Alicia, hey,

53:04.800 --> 53:06.016
It's okay now, it's okay.

53:06.048 --> 53:09.024
All right, it's okay.

53:09.056 --> 53:11.808
It's okay, look at me.

53:23.328 --> 53:25.280
Fuck.

53:25.312 --> 53:30.048
Guys, you don't believe me!

53:30.080 --> 53:34.432
You don't believe me.

53:34.464 --> 53:36.672
He asks a question.

53:36.704 --> 53:38.208
Did I leave you soup?

53:38.240 --> 53:41.600
No, no, the game is over.

53:41.632 --> 53:43.296
Leave us alone.

53:43.328 --> 53:44.521
Of course I leave,
I don't want to stay...

53:44.544 --> 53:47.712
Say whatever you fucking want!

53:47.744 --> 53:49.984
Okay, I will tell him that

53:50.016 --> 53:53.504
I come soon to eat soup.

53:53.536 --> 53:54.752
What'd you say?

53:54.784 --> 53:56.416
Whatever.

53:56.448 --> 53:57.664
Sergi,

54:11.328 --> 54:14.208
What are you
waiting, I translated.

54:14.240 --> 54:17.888
Now you undress.

54:17.920 --> 54:19.904
- What?
- No.

54:19.936 --> 54:21.632
Yes.

54:25.728 --> 54:27.488
Come on.

54:27.520 --> 54:29.472
Come on!

54:29.504 --> 54:32.576
- I'm waiting.
- No, game over.

54:34.240 --> 54:36.864
Game is over when I say.

54:36.896 --> 54:38.752
Hey, hey, hey
hey, whoa whoa, no.

54:38.784 --> 54:40.192
Don't point that at her.

54:40.224 --> 54:41.472
Don't point that at her!

54:41.504 --> 54:43.008
I'm waiting.

54:43.040 --> 54:45.952
I'm waiting!
Come on!

54:45.984 --> 54:48.224
Hey, look, hey, look at
me, you want a prize?

54:48.256 --> 54:50.505
Hey, Ilya, you want a prize, that's
fine, I just have a quick question.

54:50.528 --> 54:52.297
Hey look at me, buddy. Hey
look at me, I'm just wondering

54:52.320 --> 54:54.086
I'm waiting. How much
change do I get from a 20

54:54.112 --> 54:57.888
After I fuck your Georgian
whore of a mother, huh? Right?

54:57.920 --> 54:59.945
'Cause if there's three guys
it's a discount, right, 'cause

54:59.968 --> 55:03.200
She fucking loves it so much, that
fucking cunt... Alicia, run, run!

55:03.232 --> 55:06.496
You!

55:06.528 --> 55:08.544
I will punish you for that.

55:08.576 --> 55:09.984
I will punish you for that.

55:17.184 --> 55:20.288
I will punish you.

55:20.320 --> 55:23.712
Okay, Chrissy, let's hunt.

55:31.488 --> 55:33.280
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

55:49.792 --> 55:53.088
Help, please!

56:03.520 --> 56:05.344
Fuck.

56:11.968 --> 56:14.304
God damn it, come on.

56:16.832 --> 56:19.168
Come on!

56:37.824 --> 56:39.008
Let her go, you fuck!

56:39.040 --> 56:39.968
I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.112
I swear to God!

56:42.144 --> 56:43.840
Are you sure, Chris?

56:43.872 --> 56:45.344
You know what?

56:45.376 --> 56:48.608
That gun has got
a very big spray.

56:48.640 --> 56:50.144
If you shoot me, I die,

56:50.176 --> 56:53.280
But this girl die with me.

56:53.312 --> 56:55.584
You want to shoot me, come on.

56:55.616 --> 56:57.120
Come on, Chris.

56:57.152 --> 56:58.345
I'll fucking do it,
I'm telling you!

56:58.368 --> 56:59.936
- I'm telling you!
- Come on!

56:59.968 --> 57:01.184
Shoot, Chris!

57:01.216 --> 57:03.040
But if you don't shoot, put down

57:03.072 --> 57:04.576
This gun because it's...

57:04.608 --> 57:06.080
Fuck you!

57:06.112 --> 57:08.768
I swear to God I'm gonna shoot.

57:08.800 --> 57:12.448
You don't fuck me, but now
for you I fuck her, yes?

57:12.480 --> 57:14.272
No, please!

57:14.304 --> 57:16.128
Get your hands off her

I'm gonna fucking kill you!

57:17.984 --> 57:19.305
- Come on, Chris!

57:19.328 --> 57:21.024
Come on, kill me!

57:21.056 --> 57:22.336
Come on!

57:22.368 --> 57:24.352
You want to kill me, step off!

57:24.384 --> 57:25.696
Come on, you asshole!

57:25.728 --> 57:26.912
Come on!

57:26.944 --> 57:28.512
Get closer,
I swear to fucking God!

57:28.544 --> 57:29.472
Huh?

57:29.504 --> 57:30.432
Come on.

57:30.464 --> 57:32.352
Oh, no, no, no!

57:38.304 --> 57:40.224
What if, Chris?

57:40.256 --> 57:42.400
Tell her that she is whore.

57:42.432 --> 57:43.904
- Tell her.
- Fuck you!

57:43.936 --> 57:46.272
I said tell her
or I'll cut her cheek again!

57:46.304 --> 57:47.360
Tell her!

57:47.392 --> 57:48.992
You're a whore.

57:49.024 --> 57:50.912
Louder, Chris, we don't hear it!

57:50.944 --> 57:52.672
- Louder!
- You're a whore!

57:52.704 --> 57:54.080
- Louder!
- You're a whore!

57:54.112 --> 57:55.968
- Yes!
- And fuck your mother!

57:56.000 --> 57:57.632
Yes!

57:57.664 --> 57:58.784
Do you hear this?

57:58.816 --> 58:00.640
Chris thinks that you're a whore

58:00.672 --> 58:02.432
And what we gonna do with whore?

58:02.464 --> 58:03.808
We gonna fuck whore!

58:03.840 --> 58:06.080
- No!
- Come on, yes!

58:06.112 --> 58:07.072
Yes, come on!

58:07.104 --> 58:08.512
Please, no, no!

58:08.544 --> 58:10.336
I said come with me.

58:10.368 --> 58:11.456
Come on, come on.

58:11.488 --> 58:13.760
Come on.

58:13.792 --> 58:15.136
Chris!

58:15.168 --> 58:16.608
It's right here, come here.

58:21.824 --> 58:23.680
No, no, please, no!

58:23.712 --> 58:24.672
Come on.

58:24.704 --> 58:26.528
Come on.

58:28.768 --> 58:31.424
No, please!

58:31.456 --> 58:32.384
Turn around!

58:32.416 --> 58:34.400
I said turn around!

58:34.432 --> 58:35.872
Look at me.

58:35.904 --> 58:37.152
Look at me.

58:37.184 --> 58:39.072
I'm gonna fuck you now,

58:39.104 --> 58:42.176
But will it be painful
or will it be nice,

58:42.208 --> 58:43.936
You have to decide,
you understand me?

58:43.968 --> 58:45.792
Get off of her,
you piece of shit!

58:45.824 --> 58:47.424
Answer me, look at me,

58:47.456 --> 58:49.440
Look at me and answer me,
is okay for you?

58:49.472 --> 58:51.104
Huh, I don't hear you.

58:51.136 --> 58:52.064
No!

58:52.096 --> 58:53.632
Is it okay for you?

58:53.664 --> 58:55.488
Huh? Tell me
it's okay for you.

58:55.520 --> 58:59.072
Get off of her!

58:59.104 --> 59:00.352
Bend down.

59:00.384 --> 59:02.656
Straight down, turn around.

59:02.688 --> 59:06.944
Turn around, come on!

59:06.976 --> 59:09.984
Don't like me to touch that?

59:10.016 --> 59:13.600
No, no, no!

59:13.632 --> 59:15.392
I'm gonna fuck you now.

59:15.424 --> 59:17.344
You fucking piece of shit!

59:23.904 --> 59:26.016
Come on!

01:01:10.336 --> 01:01:13.344
You son of a bitch,
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.624
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:01:47.296 --> 01:01:50.880
Alicia!

01:01:50.912 --> 01:01:52.521
There you go, come to me,
Alicia, come to me!

01:01:52.544 --> 01:01:55.456
- Come on, I got you!
- Help me...

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:23.328
Chris.

01:02:28.352 --> 01:02:33.280
Chris, the landmine is fake.

01:02:33.312 --> 01:02:36.128
Your friend is smart.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:38.016
He set you up.

01:02:38.048 --> 01:02:40.992
You watch
too many Hollywood movies.

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:46.464
When you step
on landmine, it blows up.

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:49.600
Real landmine always blows up.

01:03:00.032 --> 01:03:02.176
Oh my God, Alicia?

01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:05.664
Alicia?

01:03:05.696 --> 01:03:07.520
Oh, no!

01:03:07.552 --> 01:03:09.312
Oh, no!

01:03:09.344 --> 01:03:12.192
Alicia!

01:03:12.224 --> 01:03:14.688
Alicia, you're gonna be okay!

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.248
Help, help!

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.304
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:03:22.336 --> 01:03:25.952
Oh, no!

01:03:25.984 --> 01:03:27.872
Alicia!

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:29.536
Alicia!

01:03:29.568 --> 01:03:32.832
I'm so sorry, help!

01:03:35.808 --> 01:03:38.656
Oh, please, no!

01:04:38.336 --> 01:04:40.864
Oh, mom...

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.761
Sorry, do you speak English?

01:04:50.784 --> 01:04:52.224
Yes, I do.

01:04:52.256 --> 01:04:54.400
Oh thank God, the GPS...

01:04:57.408 --> 01:04:59.200
The GPS in my car died.

01:04:59.232 --> 01:05:00.224
You are lost.

01:05:00.256 --> 01:05:03.104
Yeah, it looks like it.

01:05:03.136 --> 01:05:04.224
Are you coming from Tbilisi?

01:05:04.256 --> 01:05:05.536
Where are we going?

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:07.872
Yeah, I'm going to a little town

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.664
Just outside of Poti.

01:05:09.696 --> 01:05:11.520
Poti, you have taken the wrong

01:05:11.552 --> 01:05:14.560
Turn in Girgoleti.

01:05:14.592 --> 01:05:18.944
Damn, I passed that
two hours ago.

01:05:18.976 --> 01:05:21.152
Is there a gas
station or somewhere

01:05:21.184 --> 01:05:23.232
I could buy a map?

01:05:23.264 --> 01:05:24.672
Yes, but you must go back

01:05:24.704 --> 01:05:28.864
To highway, South
maybe 50 kilometers.

01:05:28.896 --> 01:05:30.976
Okay, I don't wanna bother you,

01:05:31.008 --> 01:05:33.312
But do you maybe have an old map

01:05:33.344 --> 01:05:34.720
That I could buy from you,

01:05:34.752 --> 01:05:36.736
I'm happy to pay for it.

01:05:36.768 --> 01:05:38.560
I can print a map on the
computer if you want.

01:06:09.056 --> 01:06:10.240
Hey.

01:06:10.272 --> 01:06:11.200
This is my daughter, Lika.

01:06:11.232 --> 01:06:12.960
Oh, Lika.

01:06:12.992 --> 01:06:13.952
And you?

01:06:13.984 --> 01:06:15.552
- Me?
- What's your name?

01:06:15.584 --> 01:06:17.088
Ah, right, my name is Tanya.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.040
Tanya, my name is Chris.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:22.912
May I come in?

01:06:22.944 --> 01:06:24.672
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh great,

01:06:24.704 --> 01:06:26.656
You have such a beautiful
home, thank you so much.

01:06:26.688 --> 01:06:28.544
Thank you.

01:07:02.624 --> 01:07:06.144
So... Here.

01:07:06.176 --> 01:07:08.768
So this is Grigoleti,

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.912
So you got a wrong
turn here, so you turn around

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:12.480
And go to Poti.

01:07:12.512 --> 01:07:13.824
Okay, perfect,
thank you so much,

01:07:13.856 --> 01:07:16.096
That's definitely gonna help.

01:07:16.128 --> 01:07:19.072
- Don't get lost.
- Oh, no, I won't now, this is perfect.

01:07:19.104 --> 01:07:21.216
Uh, actually, you know what,
there's one more thing.

01:07:21.248 --> 01:07:22.752
Um, is there some place
around here

01:07:22.784 --> 01:07:24.416
Where I can get
something to eat?

01:07:24.448 --> 01:07:26.624
No, there are
no restaurant around here.

01:07:26.656 --> 01:07:28.512
Oh, that's too bad.

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:30.592
The smell in your
kitchen is so delicious,

01:07:30.624 --> 01:07:33.376
It reminded me that
I'm hungry, so...

01:07:33.408 --> 01:07:35.808
You can join us because I guess

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.464
The lobby is gonna
be for everyone, right?

01:07:38.496 --> 01:07:39.808
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.080
- Yeah.
- Oh wonderful, thank you.

01:07:42.112 --> 01:07:44.896
Please, come.

01:07:49.984 --> 01:07:52.544
Wow, this is so nice, thank you.

01:07:52.576 --> 01:07:54.656
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

01:07:54.688 --> 01:07:58.048
I can't tell you
the last time that...

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:01.664
- Welcome.
- That I had a home-cooked meal.

01:08:01.696 --> 01:08:05.536
This Georgian
hospitality is wonderful.

01:08:05.568 --> 01:08:06.912
In the states you'd be lucky

01:08:06.944 --> 01:08:08.960
For somebody
to even open the door.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.880
I'm from California.
Los Angeles.

01:09:22.912 --> 01:09:24.703
You're here for
business or pleasure?

01:09:24.736 --> 01:09:26.975
Well, a little of both I hope,

01:09:27.008 --> 01:09:29.823
I'm meeting a friend and I
have some business with him.

01:09:29.856 --> 01:09:31.904
Oh, your friend is in Poti?

01:09:36.608 --> 01:09:38.688
Please meet my husband.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:43.456
This is Chris.

01:09:43.488 --> 01:09:44.479
Hello, Ilya.

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:54.432
What are you doing here?

01:09:54.464 --> 01:09:56.352
Oh, do you know each other?

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:01.600
No.

01:10:01.632 --> 01:10:04.352
No, no, no, it's on the
picture right there.

01:10:04.384 --> 01:10:07.616
Tanya, Lika and Ilya.

01:10:18.944 --> 01:10:20.832
Is everything all right?

01:10:22.304 --> 01:10:24.416
So we go now?

01:10:24.448 --> 01:10:27.456
Go? No,
but I'm eating.

01:10:27.488 --> 01:10:28.640
We go.

01:10:28.672 --> 01:10:31.392
Ilya,.

01:10:31.424 --> 01:10:34.368
You lost, I take you.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.456
- You'll take me?
- Uh-huh.

01:10:35.488 --> 01:10:36.960
You'll help?

01:10:36.992 --> 01:10:39.328
- Of course.
- You'll help me.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.960
That's wonderful.

01:10:40.992 --> 01:10:41.993
Thank you so much, that's great.

01:10:42.016 --> 01:10:43.136
Do you mind if, uh...

01:10:43.168 --> 01:10:46.368
Can I quickly finish my Lobio?

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.400
No.

01:10:50.432 --> 01:10:53.120
- Strange. -

01:10:53.152 --> 01:10:55.872
I mean, I don't know what I did
to offend you, I'm so sorry.

01:10:55.904 --> 01:10:58.944
What did... what did I do, I just, you
know, if I could just quickly finish,

01:10:58.976 --> 01:11:00.265
I'm really hungry
and then I'll go.

01:11:00.288 --> 01:11:02.240
You didn't do anything.

01:11:02.272 --> 01:11:04.256
I don't know
what's wrong with him.

01:11:04.288 --> 01:11:06.432
Please take your time.

01:11:06.464 --> 01:11:09.824
Yes, eat, and then we go.

01:11:09.856 --> 01:11:11.552
- Of course.
- Ilya.

01:11:11.584 --> 01:11:13.248
- We go.
- Oh, yeah.

01:11:19.584 --> 01:11:20.512
Aren't you gonna join us?

01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:22.304
I'm not hungry.

01:11:22.336 --> 01:11:23.776
Oh, that's a shame 'cause

01:11:23.808 --> 01:11:25.184
This is very, very delicious,

01:11:25.216 --> 01:11:26.752
This is very good, seriously.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.304
I know I'm not from here,

01:11:34.336 --> 01:11:36.256
But I feel like it's only polite

01:11:36.288 --> 01:11:38.208
To taste some of the food
that your beautiful wife

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.120
Spent all day making for you.

01:11:41.152 --> 01:11:43.040
But maybe
that's an American thing.

01:11:46.016 --> 01:11:47.232
Tanya, this is so good,

01:11:47.264 --> 01:11:49.280
Would it be rude
if I asked for some more?

01:11:49.312 --> 01:11:50.720
Sure.

01:11:50.752 --> 01:11:52.928
Tanya,.

01:11:57.984 --> 01:11:59.744
Tanya?

01:11:59.776 --> 01:12:01.280
We go.

01:12:01.312 --> 01:12:05.184
I mean, we have
more guests coming.

01:12:05.216 --> 01:12:06.985
Oh, you have more guests? Maybe I
could stay and meet your guests,

01:12:07.008 --> 01:12:08.352
I love meeting new people.

01:12:08.384 --> 01:12:12.256
No, I think it's better
if you leave now.

01:12:12.288 --> 01:12:17.440
Oh, okay, well I guess
I better be going.

01:12:20.992 --> 01:12:22.784
Lika, it's such a cute name.

01:12:22.816 --> 01:12:24.320
Thank you.

01:12:24.352 --> 01:12:25.472
She speaks beautiful English

01:12:25.504 --> 01:12:28.256
By the way, Ilya.

01:12:28.288 --> 01:12:30.368
Such a pretty necklace.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.424
Where'd you get it?

01:12:31.456 --> 01:12:33.216
Hey, hey!

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:37.120
It's not your business, okay?

01:12:37.152 --> 01:12:39.680
We go.

01:12:39.712 --> 01:12:42.112
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's fine.

01:12:42.144 --> 01:12:43.808
Thank you, Madloba, for the map.

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:44.800
You're welcome.

01:13:11.712 --> 01:13:13.280
Hey.

01:13:13.312 --> 01:13:15.104
Hey, Chris.

01:13:15.136 --> 01:13:17.632
You and me, okay?

01:13:17.664 --> 01:13:22.976
You and me, in 15 minutes,

01:13:23.008 --> 01:13:25.664
Down this road at the dirt side.

01:13:25.696 --> 01:13:26.752
You don't miss it, okay?

01:13:26.784 --> 01:13:28.800
You and me.

01:13:30.912 --> 01:13:34.784
- 15 minutes?
- Yes, 15 minutes.

01:13:34.816 --> 01:13:36.672
Tell you what, I can
be there in an hour.

01:13:36.704 --> 01:13:38.432
Okay, one hour.

01:13:38.464 --> 01:13:41.536
It's your choice, but leave

01:13:41.568 --> 01:13:43.296
My family out of this, okay?

01:13:43.328 --> 01:13:45.280
You and me.

01:13:45.312 --> 01:13:46.272
What was that?

01:13:46.304 --> 01:13:47.424
You and me.

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:51.712
Leave my family
out of this, okay?

01:13:51.744 --> 01:13:54.144
Okay, thanks for the map.

01:13:54.176 --> 01:13:56.000
Yeah.

01:18:34.464 --> 01:18:35.904
Hey!

01:18:35.936 --> 01:18:37.600
Someone open up?

01:18:39.008 --> 01:18:41.024
I'm sorry, it's me again,

01:18:41.056 --> 01:18:42.944
There's been an accident,
it's an emergency!

01:18:54.336 --> 01:18:55.657
I was coming around
the corner, and he...

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.097
He just ran into
the middle of the road,

01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.540
He's in bad shape,
you gotta help him!

01:19:05.792 --> 01:19:07.072
Tanya!

01:19:07.104 --> 01:19:09.984
Tanya, Tanya!

01:19:13.184 --> 01:19:15.808
Tanya!

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.056
Tanya!

01:19:18.496 --> 01:19:19.584
Tanya!

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.136
- Tanya!
- Ilya, Ilya!

01:19:23.168 --> 01:19:25.920
Tanya!

01:19:25.952 --> 01:19:27.177
T was an accident, I'm so sorry,

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.672
I never meant to.

01:19:28.704 --> 01:19:30.048
I kill you!

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:49.088
- I kill you!
- Go ahead.

01:19:51.104 --> 01:19:52.704
Go ahead.

01:19:52.736 --> 01:19:54.944
Stop!

01:19:54.976 --> 01:19:56.064
Stop now!

01:19:56.096 --> 01:19:57.856
Do it.

01:19:57.888 --> 01:20:00.224
'Cause we both know
it's not loaded,

01:20:00.256 --> 01:20:02.496
But mine is.

01:20:10.496 --> 01:20:13.184
Look look look, I don't want
any trouble, okay, okay?

01:20:13.216 --> 01:20:14.880
The dog was an accident, okay?

01:20:14.912 --> 01:20:16.745
It was an accident, I brought
it in, and he tried...

01:20:16.768 --> 01:20:19.968
He wanted to shoot me. Okay? I
don't know why. What did I do?

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.512
It was self defense. It was self
defense, don't look at me like that.

01:20:24.544 --> 01:20:27.456
Chris, put the gun away, okay?

01:20:28.608 --> 01:20:30.432
We will do what you want,

01:20:30.464 --> 01:20:33.248
But you put the gun away.

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.072
- You promise?
- Yes.

01:20:35.104 --> 01:20:36.384
- Yes, I promise.
- Okay.

01:20:36.416 --> 01:20:38.208
- So...
- So okay.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.672
Everybody, just calm down.
I'm gonna put the gun away,

01:20:40.704 --> 01:20:42.944
And then you'll do
exactly what I say, deal?

01:20:42.976 --> 01:20:44.000
Deal.

01:20:45.664 --> 01:20:47.520
Okay.

01:20:47.552 --> 01:20:48.736
Get him up, get him inside.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:52.320
Get him inside, he's bleeding!

01:20:52.352 --> 01:20:55.232
Get him up! Come on, you lazy
bitch, help your fucking mother,

01:20:55.264 --> 01:20:57.920
- Help her!
- Don't you talk to her like that!

01:20:57.952 --> 01:21:00.224
- You motherfucker!
- Oh.

01:21:02.016 --> 01:21:03.552
Don't hurt him anymore!

01:21:05.568 --> 01:21:07.040
Respect my mother.

01:21:10.816 --> 01:21:11.744
Come on, this way, this way.

01:21:11.776 --> 01:21:12.864
Get him in over here,

01:21:12.896 --> 01:21:14.720
Let's go, come on guys.

01:21:17.504 --> 01:21:20.352
Get him inside!

01:21:22.848 --> 01:21:25.120
Come on, there we go.

01:21:26.624 --> 01:21:27.808
You can do it!

01:21:32.064 --> 01:21:35.008
Come on, there we go!

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:36.576
Oh, he's bleeding.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:41.696
There, good.
There we go,

01:21:41.728 --> 01:21:43.296
Isn't that much
more comfortable?

01:21:46.816 --> 01:21:48.128
That's much better, isn't it?

01:21:49.088 --> 01:21:50.144
That's good.

01:21:50.176 --> 01:21:51.680
Tanya, I'm gonna need you.

01:21:51.712 --> 01:21:54.112
Uh, I'm gonna need you
to do me a favor,

01:21:54.144 --> 01:21:55.334
Can you go sit down over there?

01:21:56.960 --> 01:21:59.296
Sit down.

01:21:59.328 --> 01:22:02.496
Go ahead, right over there.

01:22:03.456 --> 01:22:05.184
And, uh, Lika,

01:22:05.216 --> 01:22:08.000
Hey, I got a really fun thing
for you to do.

01:22:08.032 --> 01:22:11.392
We are going to tie
your mom up, okay?

01:22:11.424 --> 01:22:12.800
By her hands and her feet.

01:22:12.832 --> 01:22:14.304
Come on, take 'em.

01:22:14.336 --> 01:22:15.296
There you go.

01:22:15.328 --> 01:22:17.888
Come on, go ahead.

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.840
You do exactly what I say,
remember?

01:22:19.872 --> 01:22:21.344
That was the deal?

01:22:21.376 --> 01:22:24.704
Go ahead, come on.

01:22:24.736 --> 01:22:26.592
Listen, I have money.

01:22:26.624 --> 01:22:27.584
You have money?

01:22:27.616 --> 01:22:29.984
Really?

01:22:30.016 --> 01:22:32.864
- Is it Georgian Lari?
- Yes.

01:22:32.896 --> 01:22:35.264
- Yeah.
- Oh my God!

01:22:35.296 --> 01:22:39.104
See the problem is...

01:22:39.136 --> 01:22:41.984
- I don't want Georgian money.
- Chris, come on!

01:22:42.016 --> 01:22:43.840
I don't like Georgian money.

01:22:43.872 --> 01:22:47.616
What I want is for
Lika to tie you up.

01:22:48.864 --> 01:22:50.208
Come on.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.480
Uh, hey, Lika?
We had a deal, remember?

01:22:52.512 --> 01:22:54.912
I keep the gun down
and you do everything I say,

01:22:54.944 --> 01:22:57.440
Remember that, we made a deal?

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:00.672
No, no, no!

01:23:00.704 --> 01:23:02.208
No, no, no!

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.200
Look at that.

01:23:06.016 --> 01:23:08.576
Chris, do...

01:23:08.608 --> 01:23:10.304
Do what you came for.

01:23:10.336 --> 01:23:12.928
Kill me and go, please, come on.

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.432
Kill me, okay?

01:23:14.464 --> 01:23:16.704
Tanya, do you hear that?

01:23:16.736 --> 01:23:19.552
He thinks that I came here
to kill him, now...

01:23:19.584 --> 01:23:20.864
Please, come on.

01:23:20.896 --> 01:23:23.872
Why would I wanna do that?

01:23:23.904 --> 01:23:25.248
Tell her.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:26.944
Tell her what it is.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.856
Look at them!

01:23:29.888 --> 01:23:32.480
Who do these belong to?

01:23:32.512 --> 01:23:33.760
Who do they belong to?!

01:23:33.792 --> 01:23:35.520
They're mine, okay?
They're mine!

01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:37.664
Oh they're yours,
that's right, they're hers.

01:23:37.696 --> 01:23:39.360
I was drunk.

01:23:39.392 --> 01:23:40.768
When I drink,

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.040
I do bad things,

01:23:43.072 --> 01:23:45.248
But I don't drink anymore.

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.784
You understand?

01:23:46.816 --> 01:23:47.872
I get it, so you just do...

01:23:47.904 --> 01:23:50.144
- You do crazy things?
- Yes!

01:23:50.176 --> 01:23:53.184
So, I think it's only fair
that I should have a drink.

01:23:53.216 --> 01:23:56.352
Oh, Chris!

01:23:56.384 --> 01:23:57.504
This looks like it's good.

01:24:04.288 --> 01:24:06.272
Ooh, chacha, yeah.

01:24:08.224 --> 01:24:10.176
Oh, is that homemade?

01:24:10.208 --> 01:24:13.408
That's good, that's smooth.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.712
Oh, where are my manners?
You know what, ladies,

01:24:15.744 --> 01:24:18.016
Ladies, let's all have a drink.

01:24:18.048 --> 01:24:19.872
Tanya, have a drink with me.

01:24:19.904 --> 01:24:20.928
- No!
- Come on.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.584
Come on, come on.

01:24:23.616 --> 01:24:24.640
No!

01:24:24.672 --> 01:24:26.656
Do it.

01:24:26.688 --> 01:24:29.344
Drink it, drink it!

01:24:29.376 --> 01:24:31.520
There you go,
oh, isn't that good?

01:24:31.552 --> 01:24:34.112
That's tasty.

01:24:34.144 --> 01:24:37.280
Ilya, you know, I'd love to
have a toast with you...

01:24:37.312 --> 01:24:40.608
But you have that whole
drinking problem thing, right?

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:43.968
So, you know what?
Here's the next best thing.

01:24:46.688 --> 01:24:48.416
Now we're all drunk.

01:24:48.448 --> 01:24:50.304
Now we're all crazy.

01:24:50.336 --> 01:24:53.024
Now...

01:24:53.056 --> 01:24:55.136
I want those.

01:24:55.168 --> 01:24:56.096
Chris!

01:24:56.128 --> 01:24:57.920
Come here.

01:24:57.952 --> 01:25:00.416
- Come here.
- No, please,

01:25:00.448 --> 01:25:01.664
Please!

01:25:01.696 --> 01:25:02.816
What are you doing?

01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:06.176
- Chris, no, no.
- Don't fucking move.

01:25:06.208 --> 01:25:08.032
Come here.
Yeah, there we go.

01:25:08.064 --> 01:25:10.656
Yeah, hey Tanya, you know what,
you just wouldn't understand

01:25:10.688 --> 01:25:13.824
Why I want... why I want the
panties that your daughter's

01:25:13.856 --> 01:25:16.096
Wearing right here.

01:25:16.128 --> 01:25:18.441
The reason I want these 'cause you
have to be a man to understand it,

01:25:18.464 --> 01:25:20.096
Right... right, Ilya,
don't you think?

01:25:20.128 --> 01:25:21.376
It's just so sexy, isn't it?

01:25:21.408 --> 01:25:24.224
Chris, you bastard,
you will pay!

01:25:24.256 --> 01:25:25.376
Please leave her alone.

01:25:25.408 --> 01:25:26.688
No.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.000
Take me, take my panties?

01:25:28.032 --> 01:25:30.432
- No, stop begging me.
- Let her go!

01:25:30.464 --> 01:25:33.696
Stop begging me and tell your
daughter to give me her panties.

01:25:33.728 --> 01:25:34.720
Tell her!

01:25:34.752 --> 01:25:36.480
Lika, if you love your mother,

01:25:36.512 --> 01:25:38.784
You're gonna give me
your panties right now, okay?

01:25:38.816 --> 01:25:40.160
'Cause if you don't, look at me,

01:25:40.192 --> 01:25:41.632
If you don't give me
your panties,

01:25:41.664 --> 01:25:45.024
I'm gonna put a bullet
in your pretty mother's head.

01:25:45.056 --> 01:25:46.496
No, no, no,

01:25:46.528 --> 01:25:47.497
Come on, it's just panties.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:49.824
Don't you love your mama?

01:25:49.856 --> 01:25:51.145
It's just panties,
don't you want her to live?

01:25:51.168 --> 01:25:53.728
Oh shit, Chris, Chris.

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.104
See, there we go.

01:25:55.136 --> 01:25:56.352
I give you panties!

01:25:56.384 --> 01:25:58.464
There we go.

01:25:58.496 --> 01:26:01.344
There we go, bring 'em here.

01:26:01.376 --> 01:26:02.816
That's good.

01:26:02.848 --> 01:26:04.544
Now...

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:08.320
You know what?

01:26:08.352 --> 01:26:09.513
I want 'em to...
I want you to bring 'em to me

01:26:09.536 --> 01:26:11.072
Like a dog.

01:26:11.104 --> 01:26:12.032
Like a dog,

01:26:12.064 --> 01:26:14.656
Woof, woof, you know?

01:26:14.688 --> 01:26:16.576
You know, Ilya, like a dog.

01:26:16.608 --> 01:26:18.080
Woof!

01:26:18.112 --> 01:26:21.888
Do dog have hands?

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.392
No!

01:26:23.424 --> 01:26:26.240
- No!
- No, they don't.

01:26:26.272 --> 01:26:28.736
Try again.
You know what?

01:26:28.768 --> 01:26:30.592
Try again.

01:26:30.624 --> 01:26:33.984
- Chris, listen to me, I give you panties.
- Look at her!

01:26:34.016 --> 01:26:36.896
Look at her! Crawl
like a fucking dog!

01:26:36.928 --> 01:26:38.304
Look at her!

01:26:42.752 --> 01:26:43.968
Good girl.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.856
Good girl,
that's a good little bitch.

01:26:52.064 --> 01:26:54.432
Ilya, I need you
to do something for me.

01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:59.712
Open your mouth.

01:26:59.744 --> 01:27:01.344
- Open your mouth.
- Listen to me...

01:27:01.376 --> 01:27:04.128
Open your fucking mouth or I'm
gonna smash your fucking teeth

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.257
Out of your face,
you understand me?

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.688
- Yes, I understand you.
- Open 'em.

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.504
Open, there we go.

01:27:09.536 --> 01:27:11.456
Get it in there,
that's nice and good,

01:27:11.488 --> 01:27:12.704
There we go.

01:27:12.736 --> 01:27:14.656
That's good, now, bite down.

01:27:14.688 --> 01:27:17.280
Bite down on them, yeah.

01:27:17.312 --> 01:27:18.688
You taste it?

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:21.888
Now, if you drop them...

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.064
If you drop them...

01:27:24.096 --> 01:27:26.176
I'm gonna stick my gun
up her pretty little twat

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:29.568
And pull
the fucking trigger. Okay?

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.136
Got it?

01:27:31.168 --> 01:27:33.920
Now, see, Tanya, Lika,

01:27:33.952 --> 01:27:36.224
There's a part of the story that...
that you don't know.

01:27:39.232 --> 01:27:40.480
What did I tell you?

01:27:40.512 --> 01:27:42.560
I'm gonna stick the gun
up her fucking cunt!

01:27:42.592 --> 01:27:44.864
Put it in your mouth!

01:27:44.896 --> 01:27:47.360
You're gonna keep it in your
fucking mouth, aren't you?

01:27:47.392 --> 01:27:49.235
You're gonna keep your
fucking mouth shut, right?

01:27:51.616 --> 01:27:53.664
That's good.

01:27:53.696 --> 01:27:56.416
That's more like it, thank you.

01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.648
Now, where was I?

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.728
Right, my story.

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:05.184
Come here, come here.
Come on.

01:28:05.216 --> 01:28:07.488
I know, I know, daddy wants
you alive now, come on.

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:09.120
Get the fuck up.

01:28:09.152 --> 01:28:12.352
Sit down! Sit down!

01:28:12.384 --> 01:28:16.000
Now, see, there's a part of
this story that you don't know.

01:28:16.032 --> 01:28:18.560
There's a girl,
and I was in love with her.

01:28:18.592 --> 01:28:21.856
Her name was Alicia.
She wasn't doing so good,

01:28:21.888 --> 01:28:24.384
Not like pretty
little Lika here,

01:28:24.416 --> 01:28:27.136
No, she wasn't
doing good at all.

01:28:27.168 --> 01:28:30.304
Nope, in fact
she was in incredible pain.

01:28:30.336 --> 01:28:34.016
There wasn't anyone
to help for Miles.

01:28:34.048 --> 01:28:36.288
I tried to save her.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.336
I carried her, you know?

01:28:38.368 --> 01:28:40.832
When I couldn't carry her,
I couldn't walk anymore,

01:28:40.864 --> 01:28:42.176
I put her on my back
and I crawled.

01:28:42.208 --> 01:28:44.384
I crawled every inch of the way,

01:28:44.416 --> 01:28:46.784
I heard her choking.

01:28:46.816 --> 01:28:48.896
The life falling from her
eyes, she's drowning,

01:28:48.928 --> 01:28:51.360
Her lungs filling
with her own fucking blood.

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:53.728
Then she went quiet, she didn't
make another fucking sound!

01:29:01.152 --> 01:29:03.104
Then...

01:29:05.632 --> 01:29:07.040
I found this.

01:29:19.392 --> 01:29:21.792
No, no, please!

01:29:21.824 --> 01:29:24.160
Look at... look at daddy,
look at daddy.

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:26.304
You see him?
Look at this, look at it.

01:29:26.336 --> 01:29:29.184
He loves it, he gets
off on it, don't you?

01:29:29.216 --> 01:29:32.064
Get the fuck down!
Back up!

01:29:32.096 --> 01:29:34.496
He loves it, he gets off on
this, he loves seeing the fear

01:29:34.528 --> 01:29:36.512
In his victims' eyes,
look at your daddy.

01:29:36.544 --> 01:29:37.504
You love it?

01:29:37.536 --> 01:29:39.200
You like seeing this?

01:29:39.232 --> 01:29:41.408
Oh you don't?

01:29:42.624 --> 01:29:44.896
I'm sorry.

01:29:44.928 --> 01:29:48.320
I'm sorry, he doesn't like it.

01:29:48.352 --> 01:29:51.104
Of course you don't like it.

01:29:54.496 --> 01:29:56.736
You know what?

01:29:56.768 --> 01:29:59.936
I know what's missing,
I can't believe I forgot.

01:29:59.968 --> 01:30:03.520
You don't like it
unless there's a game.

01:30:03.552 --> 01:30:06.304
And when there's a game, there
has to be a prize, right, Ilya?

01:30:08.352 --> 01:30:10.496
Who you think's gonna
win the prize today?

01:30:12.928 --> 01:30:14.592
Now, Lika, come here.

01:30:14.624 --> 01:30:15.689
Okay, listen carefully, we're
gonna play a little game,

01:30:15.712 --> 01:30:17.056
Okay sweetheart?
Come here.

01:30:17.088 --> 01:30:18.752
Come on, I know, I know,

01:30:18.784 --> 01:30:20.992
It's almost over,
it's almost over.

01:30:21.024 --> 01:30:22.976
Come here, come on,
sweetheart, it's okay.

01:30:23.008 --> 01:30:25.696
Oh, hey, hey, shh, don't cry.

01:30:25.728 --> 01:30:28.288
Oh, she's so cute.

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.208
She's so cute, don't cry,

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.616
It's okay,
it's gonna be really fun.

01:30:31.648 --> 01:30:33.504
Okay, now,
it's a very simple game,

01:30:33.536 --> 01:30:35.456
But it's serious, okay?

01:30:35.488 --> 01:30:37.376
It's called stripper's roulette.

01:30:38.848 --> 01:30:40.704
Now here's how the game works.

01:30:40.736 --> 01:30:43.744
Now, I'm gonna take all
the bullets out of this gun.

01:30:43.776 --> 01:30:45.824
There they are,
every single one of them,

01:30:45.856 --> 01:30:47.840
But I'm gonna leave this one.

01:30:47.872 --> 01:30:50.624
Just one little bullet, Kay?

01:30:50.656 --> 01:30:52.672
There it goes, right in the gun.

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:54.688
Woo-hoo!

01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:55.648
Right?

01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:57.248
Now, you undress one

01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:59.456
And then I pull the trigger one.

01:30:59.488 --> 01:31:02.784
And if you're lucky
it's an empty chamber.

01:31:02.816 --> 01:31:04.960
Then, you undress one,
and then...

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:06.944
Then I pull the trigger
again and you win

01:31:06.976 --> 01:31:08.361
When you don't have
anything else to take off,

01:31:08.384 --> 01:31:09.472
Okay?

01:31:09.504 --> 01:31:12.672
You wanna spin it?
Come on, do it.

01:31:12.704 --> 01:31:15.264
Get the fuck off!

01:31:15.296 --> 01:31:17.088
Stop!

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.985
All right, here we go, now
we're gonna play the game.

01:31:19.008 --> 01:31:21.376
Actually, you know what,
let's have a little stage.

01:31:21.408 --> 01:31:23.328
Let's have a little stage.

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.216
Yeah, there we go,

01:31:29.248 --> 01:31:31.968
Now we got a nice, fun thing.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.856
Everybody can see.

01:31:33.888 --> 01:31:35.776
Here we go, okay?

01:31:35.808 --> 01:31:38.368
So now we're gonna play
the game.

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.256
Strip.

01:31:40.288 --> 01:31:42.176
Strip.

01:31:42.208 --> 01:31:44.608
Hey, do it to me,
do it to me, okay?

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:46.304
- Do it to you?
- Yes! Please.

01:31:46.336 --> 01:31:50.720
Why would I do
it to you you fat fuck?

01:31:50.752 --> 01:31:51.872
Do it to me.

01:31:51.904 --> 01:31:53.120
You want to eat panties?

01:31:53.152 --> 01:31:54.976
I have Alicia's panties!

01:31:55.008 --> 01:31:55.968
You remember...

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.376
You done?

01:31:57.408 --> 01:31:58.848
Are you gonna shut
the fuck up now?

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:02.240
You remember her, Alicia!

01:32:02.272 --> 01:32:04.256
- You done?
- Please!

01:32:04.288 --> 01:32:06.912
You done now? Oh, you're
gonna try and get up?

01:32:09.952 --> 01:32:11.008
Look at him!

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.128
Look at him!

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.904
Look at him,
he's trying so hard.

01:32:15.936 --> 01:32:18.784
Here we go, come on,
get up, get up.

01:32:18.816 --> 01:32:22.592
Hey Ilya, Ilya, are you done yet?
Are you done?

01:32:22.624 --> 01:32:24.800
Hey, if you're not done...
Hey look at me, you fat fuck!

01:32:24.832 --> 01:32:26.400
Look at this!

01:32:26.432 --> 01:32:27.776
Oh!

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:31.360
Oh, whoa, I'm gonna
do it again, ready?

01:32:31.392 --> 01:32:33.408
No, no, no, please, Chris!

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.872
- Are you done? Are
you fucking done? - Yes!

01:32:35.904 --> 01:32:38.016
- Are you done? Are you done?
- Yes!

01:32:38.048 --> 01:32:40.256
Okay, hey, everybody
shut the fuck up,

01:32:40.288 --> 01:32:42.528
We're gonna play a nice game,
aren't we, Ilya?

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.553
- You're gonna like the game, don't you?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:32:44.576 --> 01:32:46.569
- Tell me you love the game!
- Yes, yes, I love game!

01:32:46.592 --> 01:32:47.913
- You love the game!
- I love game!

01:32:47.936 --> 01:32:50.432
That's right,
now we're gonna play the game!

01:32:50.464 --> 01:32:52.544
- Strip!
- Okay, let me play!

01:32:52.576 --> 01:32:54.176
Strip!

01:32:54.208 --> 01:32:55.328
Now I'm gonna count to three,

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.576
And if you don't undress,

01:32:56.608 --> 01:32:57.920
I'm gonna pull
the trigger anyway

01:32:57.952 --> 01:32:59.744
And that's wasting a chance.

01:32:59.776 --> 01:33:01.312
Don't do that.

01:33:01.344 --> 01:33:04.256
One, two, three...

01:33:04.288 --> 01:33:07.584
Oh. Listen,
I'm really disappointed

01:33:07.616 --> 01:33:08.809
In your fucking
parenting skills!

01:33:08.832 --> 01:33:09.920
I... I can explain.

01:33:09.952 --> 01:33:12.864
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!

01:33:12.896 --> 01:33:14.368
You need to explain to her

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.672
That she should undress.

01:33:16.704 --> 01:33:18.464
Okay?
Explain to her,

01:33:18.496 --> 01:33:19.648
She's not wearing much, Ilya,

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.824
This is a fun game.

01:33:21.856 --> 01:33:23.497
You know, she's not wearing...
she's got a bra,

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.672
She's got a shirt,

01:33:24.704 --> 01:33:27.328
And this pretty little dress.

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:29.920
Odds are she gets one in
six that she gets a bullet

01:33:29.952 --> 01:33:31.680
In her pretty fucking head,
now isn't it?

01:33:31.712 --> 01:33:34.368
Those are good odds, you
like those odds, don't you?

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.640
Those are better
odds than Alicia got!

01:33:36.672 --> 01:33:38.336
You fuck!

01:33:38.368 --> 01:33:39.689
So, we're gonna
play the game, aren't we?

01:33:39.712 --> 01:33:41.696
- Yes!
- That's right!

01:33:41.728 --> 01:33:44.288
Strip!

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.400
Tell her to undress, one!

01:33:49.152 --> 01:33:50.592
Two!

01:33:50.624 --> 01:33:52.000
Hurry up!

01:33:52.032 --> 01:33:53.696
She's undressing, yes...

01:33:53.728 --> 01:33:55.104
She's undressing, that's right,

01:33:55.136 --> 01:33:56.096
Good girl, three!
