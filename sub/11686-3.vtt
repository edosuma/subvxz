WEBVTT

00:09.080 --> 00:10.491
Here it is.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.645
This is your future.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.447
One of your Pied Piper boxes
would go right here in this rack.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.726
okay-

00:23.720 --> 00:24.960
Okay.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.321
Let me show you the next location
in which we would install one of your boxes.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.243
Richard,
what the fuck are we doing here?

00:36.320 --> 00:38.129
I don't like it any more than you do.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.204
I told Jack we'd come check this place out
and then we'd have a discussion.

00:41.280 --> 00:44.204
I can't believe you suggested
the idea of building a fucking appliance.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.327
I didn't, okay?

00:45.440 --> 00:49.570
I pitched it as an example of what not to do
and the fucking sales guys ran with it.

00:49.640 --> 00:50.880
I didn't want to go to enterprise.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.166
You were the ones who said it would be fine.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.044
- No, we didn't say that.
- You said it all the time.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.610
That's not what we said. That is not...

00:56.520 --> 01:00.366
Here it is. This is where another one
of your Pied Piper boxes would go.

01:04.800 --> 01:05.881
Okay. Good.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.925
Okay. Let me show you the next location
in which we would install...

01:09.000 --> 01:10.445
Actually, you know what?

01:10.760 --> 01:13.525
Sorry. No offense,
but once you see one space in a rack,

01:13.640 --> 01:15.165
you've kind of seen them all.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.928
That's what I used to think
until I saw them all.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.247
Would you like to see your desks?

01:23.320 --> 01:24.810
- Our desks?
- What?

01:26.120 --> 01:29.442
This is where we would install
a Pied Piper engineer.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.926
Sorry. Why, exactly,
would we need to be here?

01:35.520 --> 01:40.287
Your sales representative promised
24-hour-a-day, on-site maintenance,

01:40.360 --> 01:41.930
at least for the first year.

01:42.440 --> 01:47.287
So, one of us would have to be down here
for a year?

01:47.720 --> 01:48.846
Even at night?

01:50.320 --> 01:53.529
There's really no difference between
day and night down here,

01:53.880 --> 01:55.882
so it makes things easy.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.442
Okay, well, we should probably
get going. Now.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.204
- Almost right now.
- Yeah, right now even.

02:02.360 --> 02:06.081
Okay. Uh, there are 16 stairwells.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.850
Which one would you like to see first?

02:08.039 --> 02:10.202
Uh, just whatever's as fast as possible.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.560
Your favorite one.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.721
Hmm.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.561
Okay.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.081
Oh!

02:24.680 --> 02:26.648
You see these fucking mole people?

02:28.640 --> 02:29.926
Hey, where did John go?

02:30.520 --> 02:32.602
Oh, shit. Did he go in a room?

02:32.920 --> 02:35.082
No. Uh, probably around here.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.445
Hey. John?

02:39.200 --> 02:40.929
- John?
- Oh, uh... John?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.843
- John!
- Oh, shit.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.287
John!

02:46.400 --> 02:47.731
- Where is he?
- John!

02:47.800 --> 02:49.211
John!

03:01.000 --> 03:04.686
We can't take my algorithm
and put it in a box and bury it at Maleant.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.127
- We just can't.
- I think this thing is dead.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.849
Jack, look, I have no doubt

03:10.960 --> 03:13.201
that your guys can sell a box

03:13.280 --> 03:16.568
and an appliance may be
a good short-term play,

03:16.640 --> 03:19.166
but in the long term, we need to be building

03:19.240 --> 03:20.969
-our full-time platform.
- Gloria!

03:21.360 --> 03:24.045
Could you call the fish guy
and see what kind of warranty

03:24.120 --> 03:27.249
we have on these things?
I think one of them is dead.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.765
Jack, please.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.161
You said that when we got back from Maleant,
we would discuss this.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.004
Okay, let's discuss it.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.607
Take a look at the
Conjoined Triangles of Success.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.490
Now, what do those two triangles
make together?

03:41.640 --> 03:44.405
- A square?
- A box. They make a box.

03:44.480 --> 03:47.723
- You can't make that shit up.
- But you literally did make it up.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.084
Yes, I did.
And now they teach it at business schools.

03:51.160 --> 03:54.562
But I was only referring to the serendipity
of the coincidence.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.211
Look, if we build you the box,

03:57.280 --> 04:00.807
will you promise to let us build the platform
when it's done?

04:01.280 --> 04:03.760
We'll think about then then.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.842
Now we need to worry about now.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.049
Build me a box now.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.081
How'd it go?

04:15.160 --> 04:16.524
Uh, not well.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.805
All right, then.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.129
What do you... What do you mean?
What are you doing?

04:22.240 --> 04:25.323
Well, first, I'm changing my Linkedln status

04:26.200 --> 04:27.611
to "Looking for work."

04:28.480 --> 04:31.484
That box is artless commerce.
I won't be a party to it.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.449
So, you're just gonna quit?

04:33.520 --> 04:35.409
Just like that? How can you do that?

04:35.800 --> 04:40.840
By saying the words "I" and "quit"
in conjunction together, i.e., "I quit."

04:40.920 --> 04:43.127
Well, there's actually
some paperwork involved.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.168
Hey, can I have that USB missile launcher?

04:48.080 --> 04:50.003
I'll just fish it out of the trash later.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.606
Gilfoyle, come on.

04:51.680 --> 04:55.207
Give me some time to figure a way out of this,
'cause if you quit now,

04:55.560 --> 04:56.891
you're gonna lose all your shares.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.407
And what if Barker changes his mind
and lets us build the platform?

05:00.520 --> 05:01.806
And the odds of that are?

05:04.520 --> 05:07.649
Already? Recruiters move fast these days.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.886
This is Gilfoyle. Dazzle me.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.009
More recruiter swag?

05:22.320 --> 05:23.606
You got an Oculus?

05:23.680 --> 05:25.489
- Yup.
- That's a hoverboard?

05:25.760 --> 05:27.250
How many meetings are you taking?

05:27.560 --> 05:29.289
None. That's the irony.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.569
The more meetings I turn down,
the more these recruiters send me.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.521
- What are you doing?
- Eating popcorn.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.171
- That's my popcorn.
- You have seven tubs of it.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.083
You could be the mayor of Popcornopolis.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.171
Don't eat the caramel.
You can have the cheese or the plain.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.931
- You're leaving me with the cheddar?
- That's right. Dick.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.044
Hey, can I borrow this? Just for a little bit?

05:50.160 --> 05:52.128
No. Whoa, whoa, hold on.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.525
You're wearing a gold chain?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.689
Oh, right. Yeah, I've had it for a while.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.205
Just kind of throw it on every now and then.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.651
None of that is true.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.202
- I definitely would've noticed.
- Okay, listen.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.681
I've been working hard.
I'm making money for the first time.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.327
I was like...
Buy myself something nice, you know?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.929
But instead of that, you bought a chain?

06:11.480 --> 06:13.801
You're just jealous I have a salary, quitter.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.965
And you are too legit to quit, eh, MC Hamas?

06:18.240 --> 06:20.766
- Fuck off.
- Later, Chain the Virgin.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.041
Well, Gilfoyle, looks like your recruiters

06:24.120 --> 06:26.407
are gonna have to take back their gift baskets,

06:26.480 --> 06:28.482
because I just got off the phone with Monica

06:28.560 --> 06:30.608
and she's getting me in
to see Laurie this morning

06:30.680 --> 06:33.126
so I can tell her what's going on.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.208
But you're going over your CEO's head?

06:36.280 --> 06:38.089
That is a serious breach of protocol.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.128
I mean, if Jack finds out, he'll be furious.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.804
Hey, when you push a man so far,

06:41.920 --> 06:44.321
he goes out and buys a gun
and shoots everyone in a bank.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.567
Whoa.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.881
No, l wouldn’t, l wouldn’t.
I'm not... I'm not going to.

06:47.960 --> 06:51.407
Just... The point is,
what other option do I have, anyway?

06:51.640 --> 06:53.688
What other option do you have, Richard?

06:54.760 --> 06:56.524
Can I speak with you alone, please?

06:56.920 --> 06:57.967
Hmm?

06:59.840 --> 07:01.808
Are you angry with me, Richard?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.609
Have I done something to offend you?

07:03.920 --> 07:05.843
No. What are you talking about?

07:05.920 --> 07:09.288
You know, when you and the boys picked up
and went to the new offices,

07:09.360 --> 07:10.850
and didn't invite me along,

07:11.960 --> 07:14.440
- I didn't say anything.
- Yeah, because you don't work at Pied Piper.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.888
And you haven't let me forget that
for even one moment, have you, Richard?

07:18.080 --> 07:19.684
I'm having trouble tracking this.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.569
I don't know what you're mad about.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.371
You publicly proclaimed,
"I have to go over Barker's head

07:24.440 --> 07:27.125
"because what other option do I have?"

07:28.760 --> 07:30.922
What other option do you have, Richard?

07:33.040 --> 07:34.451
- Uh...
-'Cause there is another option,

07:34.520 --> 07:36.568
and he's standing here,
looking you in the face,

07:36.640 --> 07:38.529
and you're staring back
like he don't even exist.

07:38.880 --> 07:42.327
Just to be as clear as I possibly can be here,

07:42.440 --> 07:45.922
are you trying to tell me
that you want to talk to Barker?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.731
No, Richard, I don't want to talk to Barker.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.404
- I want you to want me to talk to Barker.
- You know,

07:53.560 --> 07:57.645
at this point, if it'll make you feel better,
sure, you can go talk to Barker.

07:58.360 --> 08:00.647
See? Was that so hard?

08:01.240 --> 08:04.722
Actually, yes, that was painfully difficult.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.563
Yeah, she's definitely dead.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.968
I'm sorry for your loss. Gloria!

08:14.240 --> 08:16.527
Gloria!

08:17.840 --> 08:21.731
Would you, uh, take this daughter of Neptune
back from whence she came?

08:22.920 --> 08:25.207
The toilet, dear. That's okay.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.686
What can I do for you, Mr. Bachman?

08:28.840 --> 08:30.444
Ah, yes, to the matter at hand.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.441
I spoke with Richard about the box project,

08:34.679 --> 08:36.808
and, well, here are some of my thoughts
in no particular order.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.520
- Why a box?
- What information do I not already have?

08:40.840 --> 08:41.921
I'm sorry?

08:42.120 --> 08:44.691
I said, "What information
do I not already have?"

08:45.080 --> 08:49.529
I already have a five-year run rate
plus a full market forecast for my appliance.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.807
I have the same for Richard's platform.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.770
I've heard all of his
engineering team's complaints.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.683
So, before you waste time

08:56.760 --> 08:59.969
with some freeform jazz odyssey
of masturbatory bullshit,

09:00.160 --> 09:03.960
just tell me what concrete information
you have for me

09:04.160 --> 09:06.447
that I do not already possess!

09:10.480 --> 09:11.766
Richard.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.603
The way I see it,
you've got about two options.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.488
One, you build yourself the box.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.651
Two, you get Laurie Bream
on the phone ASAP.

09:25.680 --> 09:27.523
All right, I'll see you back at the house.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.324
Uh, okay.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.604
Uh, Hiroki-san.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.048
Um, what is that one?

09:43.160 --> 09:45.811
It is a question mark made of human hair,

09:45.880 --> 09:48.645
harvested, apparently,
from dead people in India.

09:48.840 --> 09:54.529
It's a pun. it signifies that at Raviga,
we ask the big, hairy questions.

09:54.800 --> 09:57.007
Right. Speaking of questions,

09:57.360 --> 09:58.930
what should we do about Jack?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.650
Well, I concur with your assessment

10:00.720 --> 10:03.803
that a backup appliance
for data centers seems

10:03.880 --> 10:06.247
an uninspired application of your technology.

10:06.320 --> 10:10.006
I will contact him and we'll have
a frank discussion about this.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.084
Great. I really appreciate
you hearing me out on this.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.523
And it goes without saying, I was never here.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.001
Oh.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.561
What?

10:21.880 --> 10:23.291
You are here. Now.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.171
What Richard means is he would prefer

10:26.240 --> 10:29.722
if you didn't tell Jack
that he came here to talk to you about this.

10:29.800 --> 10:34.089
Yes, because the other interpretation
makes no sense.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.569
Jack, Laurie Bream on line one.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.889
Guys. Guys, it's happening. It's happening.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.086
Hello.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.891
Okay. Drop the hammer, Laurie Bream.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.888
What are you doing?
He's going to see you looking.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.724
I can't see 'cause of these fucking monitors.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.968
- Whose fucking fault is that, okay?
-It's not my fucking fault.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.371
Something's happening.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.126
What?

11:00.320 --> 11:02.448
What's happening? What's happening?

11:02.520 --> 11:04.170
Oh, man. Barker's pissed.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.685
How pissed? Scale of one to 10.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.723
- Like, a seven.
- Fuck.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.167
No,no,no,no,no.
Like, a nine, nine and a half.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.765
Fuck! I'm missing everything.

11:11.840 --> 11:12.921
I'm going to go to the kitchen.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.161
He doesn't know. I could be hungry.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.401
It's over. It's over.

11:16.600 --> 11:21.128
I missed the whole fucking thing
because of these fucking monitors.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.289
Richard? Jack would like
to see you in his office.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.006
Oh, okay.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.051
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen,

11:29.120 --> 11:32.567
I'm gonna go ask Action Jack
how Laurie's dick tastes.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.731
- Don't... No.
- Yeah.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.730
You wanted to see me, chief?

11:38.120 --> 11:40.202
Sure, come on in, Richard. Grab a seat.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.801
Sure.

11:43.560 --> 11:44.561
Oh.

11:45.160 --> 11:46.605
Yeah. Okay.

11:46.680 --> 11:49.889
So, guess who I just got off the phone with.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.084
Uh. I have no idea. Who?

11:53.640 --> 11:57.770
- Laurie Bream.
- Laurie Bream. From Raviga?

11:58.440 --> 12:01.728
Exactly. She was pretty adamant

12:01.800 --> 12:05.168
that the whole box project
here at Pied Piper was

12:06.360 --> 12:07.964
woefully misguided.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.771
Whoa, strong words. Wow.

12:10.840 --> 12:15.004
In fact, it was her opinion that we should
immediately abandon the box

12:15.080 --> 12:18.482
in favor of the consumer platform
version of Pied Piper

12:18.600 --> 12:21.922
which I believe you and your guys
were bucking for.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.926
I don't know about "bucking,"

12:25.000 --> 12:27.287
but, yeah. Yeah, well, hey, look,

12:27.720 --> 12:30.803
- Laurie Bream is the investor.
- Yeah.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.491
She is the investor.

12:34.720 --> 12:38.202
Anyway, she wanted a comprehensive,
go-to-market strategy

12:38.280 --> 12:41.170
for the platform version within 48 hours.

12:42.280 --> 12:45.045
Wow. Well, what Laurie wants, Laurie gets.

12:45.720 --> 12:49.122
So, yeah.
We should probably get started on that.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.440
No, we shouldn't, Richard.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.129
We're not building the platform.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.565
We're building a box.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.246
Okay, but...

12:57.320 --> 13:00.130
Didn't Laurie say that
she wanted the platform?

13:00.200 --> 13:03.124
Yes, she said that, and then I said

13:03.200 --> 13:06.886
that if Pied Piper was going
to build a platform,

13:06.960 --> 13:08.530
she would have to fire me.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.330
What did she say?

13:11.400 --> 13:15.450
She said she was not interested
in doing that at this time.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.124
And did she say anything after that?

13:17.200 --> 13:18.804
We're building the box, Richard.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.965
Twelve weeks from today, we're going to
present her a prototype of that box.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.649
So, let's get it done.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.686
Okay.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.447
Yup.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.204
One more thing, Richard.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.684
If you're going to shoot the king,

13:42.480 --> 13:44.562
you better be goddamn sure you kill him.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.930
You understand what that means?

13:48.960 --> 13:50.485
Yeah-a r.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.922
Did you just say "Yar"?

13:56.520 --> 13:57.601
No.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.727
Look at us.
Two rogues on the King's Highway.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.688
Let the rats run in their maze.

14:07.760 --> 14:10.240
We chose this. This is our destiny.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.930
Freedom. Isn't that right, Gilfoyle?

14:16.480 --> 14:18.687
- Did you say something?
- Of course.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.886
If it's more popcorn,
tell them we're at capacity.

14:26.040 --> 14:27.883
<i>It's</i> a guy <i>from Men in Black.</i>

14:31.560 --> 14:33.050
- Bertram Gilfoyle?
- Yeah.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.690
I'm here on behalf of Twen-X recruiting,

14:34.760 --> 14:37.809
- I'm supposed to give you this.
- Pappy Van Winkle.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.609
Now we're talking. I'll take it.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.441
They told me not to give it to you
until after the meeting.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.644
I respect your skills.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.131
Let me get my jacket.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.048
She was supposed to talk Barker
out of making the box.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.246
What the fuck happened?

14:51.320 --> 14:52.765
- Richard.
- What?

14:54.720 --> 14:57.690
I was on the call, okay? She tried, he said no.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.604
- Well, then she should fire him.
- She can't fire him.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.091
Why not? She fired me.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.084
Exactly. She can't fire him
because she fired you.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.329
Firing a young CEO
and installing a much more experienced one

15:08.480 --> 15:09.561
looks like leadership.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.530
Firing two CEOs in a month looks like chaos.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.686
Richard, look, I'm sorry,
but I think the box is here to stay.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.611
Okay? Laurie's gonna have to pretend to be
in favor of it.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.444
She'll probably issue press releases

15:21.520 --> 15:25.411
talking about how it's the best application
of your visionary technology.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.206
Is there nothing that we can say to Laurie
to change her mind?

15:28.760 --> 15:30.125
If I could control Laurie,

15:30.240 --> 15:34.370
do you really think I'd be looking
out my office door at that monstrosity?

15:35.160 --> 15:37.128
Jeez, Monica, he's not that bad.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.123
I mean, he's a little ugly, I guess.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.168
Oh, the question mark. Sorry.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.846
Mr. Gilfoyle. We're ready for you.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.728
The guys cannot wait to see you again.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.201
Again?

15:58.920 --> 16:01.844
- Gilfoyle.
- What the fuck?

16:01.920 --> 16:04.241
Good to see you again, buddy.
Why don't you have a seat?

16:04.320 --> 16:05.765
You stole half of our algorithm.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.525
You think you can bring me in here
and pay me to give you the rest?

16:08.720 --> 16:12.566
No. We want you
because you're a full-stack engineer.

16:12.760 --> 16:15.331
We already paid someone else
for the missing piece of Middle-Out.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.643
- Bullshit.
- Do you know Naveen and Eric,

16:18.720 --> 16:21.405
who, until very recently,
headed up engineering at Nucleus?

16:21.480 --> 16:22.561
- Hey, man.
- What's up?

16:23.240 --> 16:25.402
- Nope.
- Well, I'm sure you at least recognize

16:25.480 --> 16:26.970
the code they brought us.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.651
That's exactly how they had it.

16:33.320 --> 16:37.086
Okay. So, EndFrame has
our entire prediction loop,

16:37.200 --> 16:39.282
down to the last fucking semicolon.

16:39.360 --> 16:43.524
So, Nucleus stole half our IP,
and EndFrame stole the other half.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.324
And now they've knitted them together.

16:45.440 --> 16:49.240
So, while we are busy building Barker's box,

16:49.360 --> 16:51.567
EndFrame is beating us to market
with a platform.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.441
So, basically, we are a fucking
mediocre appliance company.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.285
At least we'll make a little money doing it.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.001
Oh, great.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.521
So, you can go back to the car wash
and buy some more chains,

17:01.760 --> 17:03.603
huh, Pakistani Mr. T?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.205
Fuck you.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.807
Wait. Are you not wearing it?

17:08.640 --> 17:11.644
You're not. Did you take it off
because I was fucking with you?

17:11.800 --> 17:15.691
- No. it was itchy on my neck, so...
- Bullshit.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.326
That was a bad decision.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.643
You flinched. Now the pain will never end.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.606
I'm sorry to say it, but Gilfoyle's right.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.330
You're making it worse. Sorry, Django.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.329
Django?

17:28.480 --> 17:29.527
Unchained.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.491
Great. Now even fucking Jared
is busting my balls.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.923
I am. I'm... I'm busting your balls.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.243
You know what? If you're gonna give me shit
for it anyway, I'm just going to wear it.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.322
Okay, Jared.
Congratulations, by the way,

17:41.400 --> 17:44.324
but we have our own balls
to worry about, all right?

17:45.000 --> 17:49.369
Uh, look, how are we going
to save the platform?

17:49.920 --> 17:51.843
What choice do we have? Barker is the CEO.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.684
We have to do what he says.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.161
Or do we?

17:55.320 --> 17:57.482
I don't know.
I don't want to lie down for this, okay?

17:57.560 --> 17:59.483
I don't want to just give up so easily.

17:59.560 --> 18:04.441
Richard, unfortunately, in this case,
I think we have to roll over and take it.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.801
Or do we?

18:06.320 --> 18:09.324
- Erlich, you have something to say?
- Richard,

18:10.840 --> 18:14.322
when George Washington
founded a little startup

18:14.400 --> 18:17.882
we've come to know as these
United States of America,

18:17.960 --> 18:21.851
and he was tired of getting shit
from his CEO, the King of England,

18:21.960 --> 18:25.282
did he just roll over and take it from behind?

18:25.360 --> 18:29.490
No. He called on his ride-or-die homeboys,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.367
Tommy Jefferson, Benny Franklin,

18:32.520 --> 18:35.251
and Alex Hamilton,
who was half-black, so that's Dinesh.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.761
I'm not half-black.

18:36.840 --> 18:39.730
He said, "Avast, ye fellow badasses,

18:40.480 --> 18:43.370
"let's build this country
the way we motherfucking want to."

18:43.720 --> 18:47.008
And so, Richard,
if we want to build the platform,

18:47.080 --> 18:49.526
all we need to do is

18:49.600 --> 18:52.126
build the platform.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.210
That was underwhelming.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.846
Perhaps you can go into slightly more detail?

18:58.920 --> 19:01.844
We tell Barker exactly what he wants to hear.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.844
That way, he thinks
we're being good little boys.

19:05.160 --> 19:06.969
But what we're actually doing

19:07.080 --> 19:08.889
is building the platform. Think about it.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.645
What's he gonna do?

19:11.080 --> 19:13.560
- Call the cops.
- Actually, no.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.090
Uh, Erlich may be onto something.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.288
If all we gave him was the platform,

19:21.400 --> 19:23.482
Jack would have no other option

19:23.560 --> 19:26.484
than to embrace it
and then say it was his idea all along,

19:26.640 --> 19:29.530
because at that point,
he can't tell Laurie the truth.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.841
What? That he had absolutely no idea

19:31.920 --> 19:34.048
what was going on
inside of his own company?

19:34.200 --> 19:35.690
He'd look like an idiot.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.446
And Laurie wants the platform, anyway,

19:39.280 --> 19:40.770
so she'd be good for it.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.726
Okay.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.484
We build a skunkworks.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.366
A secret company inside the company.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.364
We go all Ocean's Eleven on his ass.

19:54.440 --> 19:56.010
<i>Hold on. Ocean's Eleven?</i>

19:56.200 --> 20:00.000
It's a 2001 casino heist film,
starring Julia Roberts and 11 men.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.844
I know what it is, Jared.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.049
I'm saying, not only are we going
to have to engineer,

20:05.120 --> 20:07.885
code, and stand up
a full platform on our own,

20:07.960 --> 20:09.883
we also have to make Jack
and his sales weasels think

20:09.960 --> 20:11.962
we're working on the box the entire time.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.720
And if we fuck anything up and get caught,

20:14.880 --> 20:17.850
he could take our stock
and probably have us arrested.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.322
- All right, I'm in.
- Well, you're insane.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.484
No, Dinesh, that chain is insane.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.686
And not in the membrane.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.683
Sorry, Cypress Halal.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.365
Okay, Jared, settle down.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.528
But this? This is fucking genius.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.968
Okay, how do we even begin to pull it off?

20:34.240 --> 20:36.083
Okay. Well, let's work through it.

20:36.920 --> 20:40.641
I can generate fake status reports,
purchase orders, deliverables updates,

20:40.840 --> 20:44.606
and I can liaise with sales to coordinate what
custom features we need to pretend to build.

20:44.720 --> 20:45.801
Okay, great, yeah,

20:45.880 --> 20:47.928
but faking the box is
going to be the easy part.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.287
Building the platform is the real challenge.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.169
Gilfoyle, where are we on the server space?

20:52.320 --> 20:53.685
That's gonna be tricky.

20:53.760 --> 20:57.003
When we started moving out of the house,
I dismantled Anton.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.807
All the racks, GPUs,
and cables are in storage at the office.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.605
- We're gonna have to break him out.
- That's a shit-ton of hardware.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.570
Unless we do it one piece at a time,

21:06.640 --> 21:09.849
like <i>Shawshank Redemption
or The Great Escape, you know?</i>

21:09.920 --> 21:11.763
I'd have bigger clothing on the day, but...

21:11.840 --> 21:13.205
- Wait.
- Wait.

21:13.560 --> 21:14.766
I've got a better idea.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.722
Let's say these LEGOs are Anton,

21:17.800 --> 21:21.600
sad stacks of server components
lying dormant in storage.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.371
Sneaking all of him out would be too difficult.

21:24.520 --> 21:28.923
So, if we can't break Anton out,
maybe we can break in.

21:29.040 --> 21:31.281
Stand the servers up right where they are.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.725
- Can we do that?
- Easy.

21:32.840 --> 21:36.731
I can run cable through
the drop panel in the ceiling

21:36.840 --> 21:39.081
all the way to the building's
main power panel.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.645
When I pull a little bit of power

21:40.720 --> 21:42.961
from each of the other tenants,
no one will know.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.486
Guys, I hate to keep
shitting on your campfire,

21:45.560 --> 21:47.244
but servers are not the real issue.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.522
We have a manpower problem.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.968
There's a ton of engineering
to be done on the platform.

21:52.080 --> 21:55.243
Yeah, he's right, but we have to pay them
under the table.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.721
I know just the right man for the job.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.924
You guys are fucking nuts, but I dig it.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.086
Here's the deal. I'm going to need
the back pay you guys owe me

22:05.160 --> 22:06.400
for when I was working for free,

22:06.480 --> 22:08.403
not to mention lost wages from my old job.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.251
Oh, and damages from when
Jared sexually harassed me

22:12.320 --> 22:13.810
into being friends with that Monica chick.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.647
So, all that and you're in?

22:17.240 --> 22:19.129
In? No.

22:19.200 --> 22:22.204
That's just to keep me from telling Barker
about your secret project.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.724
What? Are you serious?

22:24.800 --> 22:26.040
Oh, yeah.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.931
Well, there goes most of our cash.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.401
We just got extorted for $20,000.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.528
Fuck Carla. She was dead weight, anyway.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.046
- What's next?
- I just thought of something.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.646
It's a big problem,
but I think I've got a solution.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.607
Hello, this is Bertram Gilfoyle.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.491
Yes, I'm still available,

22:45.560 --> 22:48.769
and I would reconsider sitting down with you
and your clients

22:48.840 --> 22:53.402
if you send four large pizzas
to 5230 Newell Road

22:53.480 --> 22:55.005
in 30 minutes or less.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.206
Okay. I think that covers it.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.521
We've thought of everything. We have a plan.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.845
- Everybody in?
- In.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.805
- In.
- Fuck yes, I'm in.

23:35.880 --> 23:39.362
And I'm into the idea of taking
a bigger leadership role in the company.

23:39.480 --> 23:40.925
We're not gonna make the same mistakes...

23:41.000 --> 23:42.764
Okay, Erlich, just... Just say, "In."

23:42.840 --> 23:45.491
- We're all just saying, "In."
- I'm in-volved.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.528
Hey, you can't spell
"involved" without an "in."

23:47.600 --> 23:49.170
Just be in. Uh, Dinesh?

23:52.200 --> 23:55.761
All right, fuck it, I'm in. But on one condition.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.205
I'm going to need everyone to solemnly swear

23:59.280 --> 24:01.886
that they will no longer
make fun of my gold chain.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.284
Not a word ever again.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.727
Well, guys, I think we can agree to that.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.925
This plan better fucking work
with a sacrifice like this.

24:13.240 --> 24:15.971
Shall we drink from the teat
of Pappy to celebrate?

24:16.320 --> 24:18.721
I think I might actually
enjoy going to work now.

24:20.440 --> 24:21.566
Wait.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.683
We can't enjoy going to work.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.564
Meinertzhagen's Haversack.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.647
- What?
- Meinertzhagen's Haversack.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.686
No one? Really?

24:32.080 --> 24:33.969
No one's heard
of Meinertzhagen's Haversack?

24:34.040 --> 24:37.123
Of course I have, Jared.
Just explain it to them.

24:37.280 --> 24:40.602
Well, it's a principle of military deception.

24:40.680 --> 24:44.241
Essentially, it means
you have to continue to act the part.

24:44.560 --> 24:48.246
So, as far as anyone knows,
we're still building a box that we hate.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.887
- We need to act like it.
- That's exactly right.

24:51.680 --> 24:54.570
If we do anything differently,
Barker's going to be onto us.

24:54.680 --> 24:56.842
We have to keep complaining about Barker.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.968
We have to keep bitching about the box.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.805
We have to keep making fun
of your gold chain.

25:02.080 --> 25:05.641
We have to.
We don't have any other choice, Dinesh.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.724
- He's right.
-It's a shame, Bell Biv Dinesh,

25:08.800 --> 25:12.725
but unfortunately, that chain is poison.

25:12.920 --> 25:15.048
All right. To skunkworks!

25:15.120 --> 25:18.488
Hey, all right. I don't usually drink
at 7:30 in the morning, but...

25:19.600 --> 25:20.601
All right.

25:25.280 --> 25:29.046
Hey, guys, um, look,
we have to shred everything in this house

25:29.240 --> 25:32.130
that pertains to skunkworks.
If anyone catches wind

25:32.320 --> 25:34.766
of anything that we've done here,
we are fucked.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.723
Okay, you guys, this is it.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.290
No turning back now.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.691
Dinesh, I have a few premium chain insults

25:46.760 --> 25:49.286
that I'm going to lay on you
when we get in there.

25:49.680 --> 25:52.411
Not for myself, obviously, but for the team.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.960
I might just have one, too. Sorry in advance.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.326
Yeah. Great.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.524
Have at it, assholes.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.406
Hey, Dinesh, nice chain.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.966
Do you choke your mother with it
when you put your penis in her butthole?

26:30.040 --> 26:31.929
What the fuck? Oh, shit!

26:32.680 --> 26:35.286
- Whoa, Richard.
- Here, I've got it.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.410
No, no, no, that's private. Excuse me.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.207
- Skunkworks?
- Private information.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.570
Uh, Keith, where are you going?

26:47.480 --> 26:50.689
Richard, why did you bring
all the skunkwork docs into the office?

26:50.920 --> 26:52.763
You were supposed to shred those.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.450
Yes, but I was gonna shred them here,

26:54.520 --> 26:56.682
because we don't have a shredder
at the house, do we?

26:57.880 --> 26:58.927
Guys?

27:00.480 --> 27:02.050
My office. Now.
