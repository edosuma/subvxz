[choir singing throughout]

00:05.373 --> 00:12.380

00:15.383 --> 00:25.359
*

00:25.393 --> 00:35.369
*

00:35.403 --> 00:49.883
*

00:57.158 --> 01:00.027
(door knocking)

01:00.060 --> 01:02.996
(speaks in German)

01:28.088 --> 01:29.490
(speaks in German)

01:36.930 --> 01:39.433
(paper rustling)

03:28.141 --> 03:29.977
- Good.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.745
Good.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.339
(mysterious hymnal music)

06:12.372 --> 06:22.416
*

06:22.416 --> 06:32.359

06:32.392 --> 06:42.436

06:42.436 --> 06:52.379

06:52.412 --> 07:02.456

07:02.456 --> 07:12.432
*

07:22.876 --> 07:25.412
- [Emmit] Honestly Buck
it's a little embarrassing.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.780
I mean we called the number.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.348
They said if there
was ever a problem

07:28.381 --> 07:31.351
we should call the number,
and well we called it.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.420
- And?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.422
- A series of
clicks and buzzers.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.824
- A series of--

07:36.857 --> 07:38.458
- Clicks and buzzers.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.693
That's what we got, which--

07:39.727 --> 07:40.694
- Couldn't even leave a message.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.329
- No message possible.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.597
So we thought--

07:43.631 --> 07:45.332
- We thought get
Buck back in here,

07:45.365 --> 07:47.668
after all he vouched for him.

07:47.701 --> 07:51.672
- Well now, let's be,
let's call a spade a spade.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.874
I don't know him,
don't vouch for him.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.609
I was just a conduit
for information.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.879
Like you said "Buck we tried
all the normal channels,

07:58.912 --> 08:00.848
"and we just need
a bridge loan to--"

08:00.881 --> 08:02.850
(laughs)

08:02.883 --> 08:04.484
It was last year
for pete's sake.

08:04.518 --> 08:05.719
I met him at the Shriner's.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.287
- Sure, okay then.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.356
Everything went great when
we met with the broker,

08:09.389 --> 08:11.959
Mr Ehrmantraut, if I'm not a-

08:11.992 --> 08:13.727
- Right, Rick Ehrmantraut.

08:13.761 --> 08:14.962
I got his card in my--

08:14.995 --> 08:17.297
- And now we're in
the black again,

08:17.330 --> 08:19.332
so we called the number
to arrange payback

08:19.366 --> 08:20.500
and clicks and buzzers.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.638
- Maybe there's another
number, we're thinking.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.874
- Another number where we can
at least leave a darn message.

08:26.907 --> 08:27.975
It's a lot of money.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.309
- A heck of lot.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.711
- And it's just sitting
there on the books which--

08:30.744 --> 08:32.379
- Can't have that.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.653
- Okay then well,

08:39.687 --> 08:42.055
thanks for coming in.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.424
- Of course.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.827
And did you think
about what I asked?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.395
The widow Goldfarb
she wants to meet.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.664
- The who?
- I was gonna tell ya.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.500
She's the so called storage
queen, sniffing around

08:53.533 --> 08:56.870
for a possible silent
partner type arrangement.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.338
- [Buck] Seems
like the real deal.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.372
Money to burn.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.441
- Where was she two years ago?

09:01.474 --> 09:05.312
(people clapping)

09:06.313 --> 09:08.515
Friends, friends and Dave.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.917
(people laughing)

09:09.950 --> 09:11.384
I'm not lying when I tell ya,

09:11.418 --> 09:13.420
I still remember the first date.

09:13.453 --> 09:14.554
25 years ago.

09:16.724 --> 09:19.927
Took her to Fjords in
St. Paul, my Stella.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.463
I brought her a lobster
the size of a car.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.599
Cost me two weeks
wages at the Red Robin,

09:25.633 --> 09:27.901
but it was worth it.

09:29.502 --> 09:33.473
And so over shellfish she
says "where do you live?"

09:33.506 --> 09:34.708
You know, just
making conversation

09:34.742 --> 09:38.879
and I tell her the
address 213 Monroe.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.081
And she gets this
funny look on her face.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.751
And she says "which apartment?"

09:43.784 --> 09:44.952
So I say "16."

09:46.453 --> 09:48.822
And now the look gets even
funnier and she says--

09:48.856 --> 09:50.824
- I say "what are the odds?"

09:50.858 --> 09:53.961
I lived in that same apartment
for three and a half years,

09:53.994 --> 09:56.496
I still had the key (laughs).

09:56.529 --> 09:57.765
(people laughing)

09:57.798 --> 09:59.432
- [Emmit] Of course she
never told me that part.

09:59.466 --> 10:02.502
So I come home a week
later and what the heck?

10:02.535 --> 10:04.437
She'd moved in!

10:04.471 --> 10:06.506
(people laughing)

10:10.610 --> 10:14.782
And now somehow it's 25
years later and here we are.

10:15.883 --> 10:19.452
And we've got Grace
and her husband Dennis.

10:20.788 --> 10:24.124
And life has been to
us, more than good.

10:27.661 --> 10:31.464
- Okay.
- Raise a glass to my Stella.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.501
Still lovely as the day we met.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.603
Stella.
(people toast)

10:36.636 --> 10:38.939
- [Stella] Thank you.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.373
(people clapping)

10:40.407 --> 10:42.542
- [Emmit] Enjoy
yourselves come on.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.678
- I got you five minutes.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.452
- Go get him tiger.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.154
- Yeah.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.490
(jazz music)

11:02.495 --> 11:03.563
- How we doing?

11:03.596 --> 11:06.066
Good to see you,
thanks for coming.

11:14.775 --> 11:18.211
[distant music throughout]

11:30.457 --> 11:31.925
- [Sy] Ray.

11:33.626 --> 11:37.765
(upbeat dramatic music)

11:59.252 --> 12:02.455
- You know, congratulations
and all that.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.191
- Thanks.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.693
- Place looks good.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.928
- We had the floors re-done.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.963
- Oh ya.
That's, uh...

12:14.167 --> 12:16.103
So you said Grace got a--

12:16.136 --> 12:17.704
That's her, her husband now?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.606
Dennis.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.108
- There was nothing.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.542
Barely even a wedding.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.711
- We did in Cabo on a beach.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.481
They said, invitation
said "no shoes."

12:28.515 --> 12:30.951
Imagine wearing a
suit and no shoes.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.219
Still real nice.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.720
- But small, only
like 10 people.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.923
- Ah but you went?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.825
- [Emmit] We had some meetings.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.059
- The next day.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.760
Potential investors.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.163
- In Cabo?

12:43.196 --> 12:45.232
- It's like a resort,
super high end.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.667
- International
businessmen and the like.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.937
- [Sy] Exclusive.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.573
- Not for parole
officers you mean.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.741
- Don't take offense.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.778
- Ya, Ray.
Geez, don't take offense.

13:00.213 --> 13:03.216
We're just explaining
what happened.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.687
- How's the Corvette?

13:07.720 --> 13:08.822
- It's a car.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.692
Look I'm getting engaged.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.161
- Again?

13:14.194 --> 13:15.295
- Don't say that.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.296
- I'm sorry I just--

13:16.329 --> 13:18.298
- She's real sweet, Nikki.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.766
We're in, you know--

13:19.799 --> 13:23.103
- You meet her at work?

13:23.136 --> 13:26.106
(upbeat jazz music)

13:26.139 --> 13:36.783
*

13:36.816 --> 13:37.784
(gum pops)

13:37.817 --> 13:39.119
- At work yeah.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.121
- So, embezzler?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.322
Drug mule?

13:42.355 --> 13:43.556
- Why is he here?

13:43.590 --> 13:44.791
He doesn't need to be here.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.894
- Sy's always here when the
conversations about money.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.962
That's what this is right?

13:48.996 --> 13:51.231
A conversation about money?

13:51.264 --> 13:53.233
- I wanna buy her a ring.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.235
- So, serious.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.703
- And the way I figure it,

13:56.736 --> 13:57.905
is you still owe me from--
- I owe you?

13:57.938 --> 13:59.873
- From what happened
when we were kids.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.942
- Well now Ray, that's...

14:03.010 --> 14:05.312
I gotta say, your math
seems shaky there.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.747
I mean, after the, what
was it last quarter,

14:07.780 --> 14:10.250
we fronted you 850
for car repairs.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.851
- On top of co-signing
your mortgage

14:11.885 --> 14:13.353
so you could get your apartment.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.155
Not that I mind,
happy to help really.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.189
But where does it--

14:16.223 --> 14:17.690
- See that's not
the way I see it.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.159
That's you paying me back for--

14:19.192 --> 14:20.660
- Ray.

14:20.693 --> 14:26.266
- The thing is Ray, even
if we wanted to, we're--

14:26.299 --> 14:29.369
- What Sy's saying is,
it's not the best time.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.138
[scoffs]
Huh.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.176
- How about you just
give me back my stamp

14:36.209 --> 14:38.011
and we'll call it square.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.179
- Ray.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.048
- No, I'm talking to my brother.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.350
Look, you are lucky I don't sue.

14:43.383 --> 14:47.754
I mean, a legal document
which delineates things.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.756
Bequeaths them to
specific parties.

14:49.789 --> 14:52.292
A father, dead in a driveway.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.861
An older boy taking advantage
of a younger playing--

14:54.894 --> 14:56.296
- Nobody took advantage.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.098
It was a trade.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.934
If I had a time machine, you'd
see I'd play back the tape.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.369
"Emmit come on, I'm begging ya.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.304
"Take the stupid stamps already.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.705
"Give me the car."

15:05.738 --> 15:07.874
- No, that's not, that
was you tricking me.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.642
- Ray.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.946
- How much did you
get for them anyway?

15:12.980 --> 15:14.081
- [Emmit] The whole collection?

15:14.114 --> 15:15.282
I never asked.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.284
- What two, three dozen stamps?

15:17.317 --> 15:19.252
Vintage.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.057
- Ray.
- No.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.793
She's a nice girl, a catch.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.163
And she deserves a
sweet ring, pricey, so...

15:32.099 --> 15:34.801
Are you gonna do
what's right here?

15:34.834 --> 15:36.303
Are you gonna do what's right?

15:39.006 --> 15:40.207
- What happened?

15:41.841 --> 15:43.743
Did you get it?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.012
- I need a real drink.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.951
Here's the er--

15:51.985 --> 15:55.288
It's not the best time.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.092
He said.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.861
Don't worry, I'm gonna--

16:01.894 --> 16:03.296
I'll handle it.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.082
(guitar music)

16:28.921 --> 16:30.757
- Ray?

16:31.924 --> 16:33.260
- Sorry.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.313
- No tip?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.082
- Ya.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.483
Get a real job.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.819
("Crazy on You" by Heart)

16:59.852 --> 17:09.896
*

17:09.896 --> 17:21.541
*

17:24.077 --> 17:28.715
So then we use the Dentist Coup
or play a canapé.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.849
And watch out
for the Cuthberts,

17:29.882 --> 17:32.018
I don't think that
cough of his is real.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.121
Whatever happens don't
let the Swedes force

17:34.154 --> 17:35.722
the trump check again.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.227
Babe?
- What?

17:41.261 --> 17:43.563
- I'm talking about the
Wildcat regional on Thursday.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.897
Top three mixed pairs
we qualify

17:44.931 --> 17:47.200
for the Upper Wisconsin semi
professional next month.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.737
Which top three in that, the
sport really opens up for us.

17:50.770 --> 17:54.241
- Now hun, you know you're not
supposed to leave the state.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.042
- I know but
couldn't you fix it?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.611
I mean as PO isn't there
a form you could sign?

17:58.645 --> 18:00.880
- Well see there's
a lot of sticky.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.215
I mean, with the first being,

18:02.249 --> 18:05.218
technically we're not supposed
to be, you know, dating.

18:05.252 --> 18:08.821
And I'm saying it's mission
critical to keep that a secret.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.657
So when it comes to
signing official forms,

18:10.690 --> 18:14.694
I mean, talk about
showing your cards.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.564
- What are you saying?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.632
- No, just as to the legalities.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.068
I mean parolee,
parole officer et cetera.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.771
I mean, we're right
on the line here.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.841
- There's big money
to be won hun.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.076
- [Ray] I know.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.179

a few regionals.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.584

sponsorship opportunities

money from your stupid brother

18:45.658 --> 18:46.793
Right?

18:48.661 --> 18:49.962
- Yeah.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.333

Applebaum Discovery Play.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.920

19:15.054 --> 19:17.324
- You're the hand
and I'm the glove.

19:17.357 --> 19:19.859
- You're the bottle
and I'm the beer.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.695
- Or the beer and
the glass in my case.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.831
- Oh yeah, but I
mean it comes in--

19:24.864 --> 19:26.165
- I know.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.335
- Yeah.

Hey, I was drinking that.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.797
Your last stretch
was six and a half

24:57.830 --> 24:59.799

rich folks' digs

they convict you,

A little robbing, not wholesale
burglary, just a specific--

25:21.888 --> 25:23.823
Just looking for a certain item.

25:23.856 --> 25:27.026
And if you do it,
well let's just say

25:27.059 --> 25:29.061
your little problem
goes up in smoke.

25:32.932 --> 25:36.402
- What are we talking about?

25:36.435 --> 25:38.671
- A stamp.

25:38.705 --> 25:42.909
- A stamp?

25:42.942 --> 25:45.712
Like a...

25:45.745 --> 25:47.513
postage stamp?

25:47.546 --> 25:50.182
- [Ray] Yeah.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.752

Cool.

25:53.653 --> 25:57.456
So I mean, I know
I'm the moron but--

25:57.489 --> 25:59.892
- It's not that kind
of stamp numb nuts.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.461
It's a vintage stamp,
it's got you know,

26:02.494 --> 26:04.063
sentimental value for me.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.432
It's my stamp.

26:06.465 --> 26:07.900
- Your stamp.

26:07.934 --> 26:11.638
- But it's, you know, at someone
else's house temporarily.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.874
- Cool, cool.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.944
So why not just ask for it back?

26:19.178 --> 26:21.547
- Well it's, you
know, complicated.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.816
Just get the damn stamp.

to come down here.

26:35.494 --> 26:36.896
- Nine o'clock at
night isn't it?

26:36.929 --> 26:38.130

ticks and buzzers.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.498
He came.

26:39.531 --> 26:40.599

26:42.835 --> 26:44.070

much on the phone just--

26:49.208 --> 26:51.010

I notice stuff like that.

27:53.572 --> 27:55.141
It's always in the basement.

It's like its own elevator.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.849
how does that
make you feel?

28:02.882 --> 28:04.650
- Huh? No.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.219
You asked me how I define
the person called me.

28:07.253 --> 28:12.591
And I'm saying, I'm always
having thoughts of...

28:14.861 --> 28:16.028
What do ya?

28:16.062 --> 28:18.064
Insightful.

28:18.097 --> 28:22.201
For example, where does the
President of United States

28:22.234 --> 28:24.603
buy his clothes?

28:24.636 --> 28:27.239
Do they shut down like
a whole JC Penney?

28:27.273 --> 28:30.109
Just so he can try on a suit.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.879
- [Shrink] There's a tailor,
he comes to the White House.

28:34.747 --> 28:38.751
- Now see, I didn't know that.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.386
- [Shrink] Let's focus.

28:40.419 --> 28:44.690
So when you say your parole
officer was mean to you before,

28:44.723 --> 28:46.658
how did that make you feel?

28:47.927 --> 28:53.232
- You know, just
not good, you know.

28:53.265 --> 28:56.635
I mean here I am,
I'm trying, you know.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.240
Not hurting anybody, anymore.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.709
So...

29:03.742 --> 29:04.977
(coughs)

29:05.011 --> 29:06.979
- [Shrink] Are you getting high?

29:07.013 --> 29:08.114
(coughing)

29:08.147 --> 29:10.082
- No.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.351
Oh shit.

29:14.653 --> 29:16.188
- [Shrink] Maurice?

29:17.689 --> 29:19.125
- Ah hell.

29:19.158 --> 29:21.961
(dramatic music)

29:21.994 --> 29:23.629
- No, no, no, no!

29:23.662 --> 29:25.631
Goddammit.

Who?

30:53.552 --> 30:55.021
- Didn't get a name.

30:55.054 --> 30:56.322
Here from the lender he said.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.724
I told him it was late, but
he just got off a plane so--

31:02.728 --> 31:04.296
- Hey there.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.199
Emmit Stussy, thanks for a--

31:09.368 --> 31:10.536
Well.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.404
Honestly we didn't know
if our message had--

31:12.438 --> 31:14.573
- You called the number?

31:14.606 --> 31:17.743
- Ya, like I said we didn't--

31:17.776 --> 31:19.178
- All you get when call--

31:19.211 --> 31:20.379
- Clicks and buzzers.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.281
Which, hard to leave a (laughs)

31:22.314 --> 31:24.250
But good news, you're here

31:24.283 --> 31:25.617
and we're in the black now.

31:25.651 --> 31:29.088
Stussy Corp and well your
firm was nice enough to--

31:29.121 --> 31:32.624
Mr Ehrmantraut, your broker,

31:32.658 --> 31:35.461
he arranged for your firm to
lend us that money last year.

31:35.494 --> 31:38.597
We're happy to say we're
ready to pay it back in full.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.432
- That's alright.

31:41.633 --> 31:42.701
- I'm sorry.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.570
- You keep it.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.606
- (laughs) Keep it?

31:47.639 --> 31:49.108
- Yeah.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.213
- I apologize, I
didn't catch your name.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.283
- I'm V.M. Vargas.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.618
- And you work for--

31:59.651 --> 32:01.320
- With Narwhal yes.

32:01.353 --> 32:02.621
- Well now.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.992
It's, see your firm, Narwhal,

32:06.025 --> 32:07.726
like I said last year,

32:07.759 --> 32:11.363
we borrowed a hefty sum.

32:12.364 --> 32:15.001
And I know you're
not bona fide FDIC,

32:15.034 --> 32:18.804
but I mean, unless you boys
do business differently in...

32:20.339 --> 32:21.840
Where you from?

32:23.109 --> 32:24.443
- America.

32:27.813 --> 32:31.617
- Well in America normally
when you lend somebody money--

32:31.650 --> 32:34.253
- If that were us, he's
saying, in your shoes,

32:34.286 --> 32:36.155
well I'd expect the
money back with interest.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.456
Which we're happy to--

32:37.489 --> 32:39.025
Like I say we got it.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.327
Just need to know where
to send the check.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.794
- Or a wire transfer if you--

32:42.828 --> 32:44.496
- Exactly just
give us the digits.

32:44.530 --> 32:47.199
- Investment.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.673
- One more time?

32:54.706 --> 32:55.807
- Well you called it a loan,

32:55.841 --> 32:58.177
it wasn't a loan,
it was an investment.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.346
We are investors.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.181
- Investors?

33:02.214 --> 33:05.217
- The problem I think,
is you're confusing the word

33:05.251 --> 33:10.156
singularity with
the word continuity.

33:10.189 --> 33:13.059
- [Emmit] What's that now?

33:13.092 --> 33:16.328
- The word begin and the
word end, are these the same?

33:16.362 --> 33:17.363
- No but--

33:17.396 --> 33:19.331
- Then why talk about
ending something

33:19.365 --> 33:21.233
that's only just begun.

33:24.503 --> 33:28.207
- See now, the document
we signed last year--

33:28.240 --> 33:29.408
- When we met with your broker.

33:29.441 --> 33:30.709
- Mr. Ehrmantraut.

33:30.742 --> 33:33.245
- Buck Olander introduced us
and he said, your broker--

33:33.279 --> 33:35.647
We were very specific
about a short term--

33:35.681 --> 33:39.385
- And nowhere in the document
did it say anything about,

33:39.418 --> 33:42.488
and believe me, I'm a
lawyer, so you know,

33:42.521 --> 33:44.223
I vetted it very--

33:44.256 --> 33:47.393
- A document is just
a piece of paper.

33:47.426 --> 33:50.096
- Legally binding actually.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.430
A contract.

33:51.463 --> 33:56.702
- To be clear, you had a
problem as you said last year.

33:57.569 --> 34:01.907
The real estate business,
well this a bad business.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.345
So you tried the normal
channels, the banks,

34:06.378 --> 34:09.415
but you're companies still
failing so you come to us.

34:09.448 --> 34:11.417
- [Sy] For a loan.

34:11.450 --> 34:14.420
- You never thought to
ask why we might lend you

34:14.453 --> 34:17.889
one million dollars with
no collateral required?

34:20.426 --> 34:23.295
- See, no, we were
under the impression--

34:23.329 --> 34:25.631
- Our fundamentals are strong.

34:25.664 --> 34:26.932
Our holdings--

34:26.965 --> 34:30.836
- My point is that was the
time for questions yes.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.472
Not this.

34:35.407 --> 34:39.478
Now we've taken the past
year to study your business.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.613
Properties, cash flow,

34:41.647 --> 34:45.784
so we can better
disguise our activities.

34:51.190 --> 34:55.627
- Look, we just wanna pay
the money back and you know,

34:55.661 --> 34:57.496
be on our way.

34:59.431 --> 35:03.935
- As I said, the first
sum was an investment

35:03.969 --> 35:05.337
for you to keep.

35:05.371 --> 35:08.840
All future funds will be run
through the front office,

35:08.874 --> 35:11.243
the same as other Stussy income.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.911
A few thousand a
month, more or less,

35:12.944 --> 35:16.648
now I can get you the
specs and instructions.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.850
We'll have to account for
the comings and goings

35:18.884 --> 35:20.852
in your software.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.823
We already have access to your--

35:24.856 --> 35:26.525
To your system.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.629
So we can monitor your activity.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.798
Make sure you're adjusting.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.534
(stammers)

35:37.569 --> 35:41.473
And it goes without saying,

you're not to mention
this to anybody.

or whatever.

36:30.789 --> 36:33.225
- Uh, cool.

36:34.860 --> 36:37.396
- The trash is under
the sink, if you hate it.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.898
- No it's...

36:39.931 --> 36:41.199
What is it?

36:41.233 --> 36:42.368
- It's nothing.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.270
Just a dumb thing I made.

36:44.303 --> 36:47.873
- [Gloria] Something special
for the clean plate club.

36:47.906 --> 36:50.276
- I told you, I don't
like strawberries.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.744
- More for me then.

36:56.047 --> 36:59.017
So the thinking is
absorb the local precinct

36:59.050 --> 37:01.119
into the larger county force.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.121
- Leaving you jack shit.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.690
- Language?

37:04.723 --> 37:07.259
No, I'd still be highest
ranking local officer just not--

37:07.293 --> 37:08.394
- Chief.

37:08.427 --> 37:09.895
- Right.

37:09.928 --> 37:11.363
What'd you get there?

37:11.397 --> 37:13.299
- A model grandpa made me.

37:13.332 --> 37:17.168
- Like I said, it's
a stupid carving.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.138
Remember when the
time we went camping.

37:20.171 --> 37:23.309
- So don't forget you're
at your dad's this weekend.

37:23.342 --> 37:26.077
He and Dale are gonna
take you to the symphony.

37:26.111 --> 37:30.882
- So is Dale my other dad now?

37:30.916 --> 37:32.150
- [Gloria] Well no.

37:32.183 --> 37:34.820
I mean he and your dad haven't
been together that long.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.322
But if they got married.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.789
- Not legal.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.057
Is it two men?

37:39.090 --> 37:41.760
- If they did, well you know
how Ennis is my stepfather,

37:41.793 --> 37:44.162
married my mom after
grandpa passed.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.432
I guess Dale would
become your stepfather.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.000
I think.

37:49.034 --> 37:50.436
I honestly don't
know how it works.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.203
- I know how it
works in the Bible.

55:11.709 --> 55:13.878
brother must have been
from another mother

55:13.911 --> 55:17.382
'cause man was he old.

55:17.415 --> 55:19.384
- What are talking about?

55:19.417 --> 55:23.220
- What matters is, is
I go what you asked.

55:23.253 --> 55:27.725
And now you can, we can tear
up the piss test and you can--

55:27.758 --> 55:30.828
I should probably get
out of town for a while.

55:30.861 --> 55:34.532
If I'm being honest given
the level of uncooperation

55:34.565 --> 55:35.800
and consequences thereof.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.568
- What the shit is this?

55:37.602 --> 55:39.604
- It's, what are
ya, it's stamps.

55:41.171 --> 55:42.139
- What did you do?

55:42.172 --> 55:43.374
- Listen, don't be--

55:43.408 --> 55:45.543
putting your hands on me,

55:45.576 --> 55:47.512
you're raising the
tone of your voice,

55:47.545 --> 55:49.414
not after the night I had.

55:49.447 --> 55:51.148
You didn't, do--

55:51.181 --> 55:52.817
The risk I took
on account of you.

55:52.850 --> 55:54.218
Your needs.

55:54.251 --> 55:55.720
- Emmit Stussy.

55:55.753 --> 55:57.922
Eden Prairie,
it's a short drive.

55:57.955 --> 55:59.223
I wrote it down.

55:59.256 --> 56:02.860
- No you said--

56:02.893 --> 56:04.529
Look I did what you said.

56:04.562 --> 56:07.432
The address on the Eden
Valley, I looked it up.

56:07.465 --> 56:09.567
And now--

56:09.600 --> 56:11.335
I'm out of pocket here Ray.

56:11.368 --> 56:13.370
I've got--

56:13.404 --> 56:16.240
I think I covered my
tracks pretty good.

56:16.273 --> 56:18.443
And look, since you touched me,

56:18.476 --> 56:21.912
I'm gonna have to
demand a dollar value.

56:21.946 --> 56:23.581
Five thousand.

56:23.614 --> 56:25.783
Which is more than fair,
considering the fella we robbed

56:25.816 --> 56:27.317
is probably dead.

56:29.787 --> 56:31.556
- What's your name handsome?

56:36.494 --> 56:41.466
- Well now, I'm not
sure I should tell ya.

56:41.499 --> 56:42.867
On account of I've
gotta think about

56:42.900 --> 56:44.902
covering my tracks here.

56:44.935 --> 56:47.472
- Darling I've seen your face.

56:47.505 --> 56:51.275
And Ray knows your name so--

56:51.308 --> 56:54.411
- It's Maurice.

56:56.847 --> 56:58.816
- Okay Maurice,

56:58.849 --> 57:00.317
You get me a towel

57:00.350 --> 57:02.753
and maybe we can discuss
this in the living room,

57:02.787 --> 57:04.989
like civilized people.

57:11.261 --> 57:12.930
Ray...

57:12.963 --> 57:14.298
The gun.

57:14.331 --> 57:18.035
(grunting)

57:20.538 --> 57:22.006
- You tricked me.

57:23.841 --> 57:25.342
You got--

57:25.976 --> 57:28.345
I'm giving ya 'til
tomorrow to get my money.

57:28.378 --> 57:30.648
Five thousand.

57:30.681 --> 57:34.318
Otherwise, well maybe
I turn you into the cops.

57:36.386 --> 57:38.455
Or shoot ya, or her.

57:39.557 --> 57:41.492
Robbing your own brother.

57:43.828 --> 57:45.630
That's just low.

57:47.832 --> 57:50.535
(dramatic music)

57:53.838 --> 57:55.740
You don't tell
Maurice what to do.

57:59.309 --> 58:01.045
- Now hun, let me explain.

58:02.580 --> 58:03.914
Hun?

58:04.749 --> 58:05.883
Hun?

58:05.916 --> 58:08.619
- [Nikki] Three floors,
10 seconds per floor.

58:08.653 --> 58:12.389
- [Ray] Hun, what are you?

58:12.422 --> 58:14.358
- [Nikki] Cross the front hall,
eight seconds.

58:18.729 --> 58:20.330
- Babe.
- Not now.

58:20.364 --> 58:21.732
- Hun what are--

58:21.766 --> 58:23.734
- Quiet, I'm counting.

58:23.768 --> 58:27.572
21, 22, 23, 24, 25.

58:27.605 --> 58:29.006

58:50.861 --> 58:52.062
50.

58:52.096 --> 58:53.564
- Can you believe this guy?

58:53.598 --> 58:55.132
I gave him a simple--

58:56.400 --> 59:00.738
I even wrote down the damn--

59:00.771 --> 59:03.040
And now just my--

59:03.073 --> 59:05.943
Just my damn luck.

59:05.976 --> 59:08.445
- [Nikki] 64, 65, 66.

59:08.478 --> 59:09.880
- Ah suck off.

59:09.914 --> 59:13.517
- 67, 68, 69, 70.

59:13.550 --> 59:16.887
- Son of a bastard.
- [Nikki] 71 72, 73, 74.

59:16.921 --> 59:20.457
- Short drive my ass.
- 75, 76.

59:21.892 --> 59:22.960
Is he out?

59:22.993 --> 59:24.094
- What?

59:24.128 --> 59:26.130
- The other window,
do you see him?

(car alarm blares)

1:00:41.839 --> 1:00:43.173
Did you see that?

1:00:45.475 --> 1:00:47.044
Oh my god.

1:00:50.748 --> 1:00:52.449
- Get down, or someone'll see.

1:00:52.482 --> 1:00:53.884
- I mean right in the--

1:00:53.918 --> 1:00:55.085
No way--

1:00:56.020 --> 1:00:57.487
He came over.

1:00:57.521 --> 1:00:58.923
Holy shit.

1:01:04.094 --> 1:01:05.595
What are you?

1:01:06.596 --> 1:01:08.632
- Yes 911.

1:01:08.665 --> 1:01:10.567
There's been an accident,
on the sidewalk,

1:01:10.600 --> 1:01:11.736
the air conditioner.

1:01:11.769 --> 1:01:13.503
Get dressed you've gotta go.

1:01:13.537 --> 1:01:14.571
- What?

1:01:14.604 --> 1:01:15.639
- Oh thank God.

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:19.176
It's 940 Hannover Street,
hurry please.

1:01:20.510 --> 1:01:21.879
It was an accident.

1:01:21.912 --> 1:01:23.547
I've been trying to get the
landlord to take that unit out

1:01:23.580 --> 1:01:26.016
for like six weeks,
it's on record.

1:01:26.050 --> 1:01:29.686
And tonight I don't know, it
must have come loose somehow.

1:01:32.522 --> 1:01:36.160
You're his parole officer,
you can't be here.

1:01:36.193 --> 1:01:37.527
- Ya but--

1:01:37.561 --> 1:01:38.662
what happens when?

1:01:38.695 --> 1:01:39.864
- I gave a fake name
when I rented the place.

1:01:39.897 --> 1:01:40.998
I got ID.

1:01:41.031 --> 1:01:42.032
- Now that's--

1:01:42.066 --> 1:01:44.034
Babe, that's a violation
of your probation.

1:01:44.068 --> 1:01:45.269
- Ray?

1:01:45.302 --> 1:01:46.737
- Oh right yeah.

1:01:46.771 --> 1:01:47.738
Good call.

1:01:47.772 --> 1:01:49.606
- We'll talk about this later.

1:01:49.639 --> 1:01:53.110
- You, you're sexy.

1:01:56.146 --> 1:01:58.916
- Yes officer,
I'll stay on the line.

1:02:01.952 --> 1:02:03.520
- Don't forget the stamps.

1:02:03.553 --> 1:02:04.621
- What?

1:02:04.654 --> 1:02:05.756
- The stamps.

1:02:05.790 --> 1:02:07.324
- Stamps, yeah.

1:02:12.963 --> 1:02:14.531
- Burn 'em, okay.

1:02:14.564 --> 1:02:15.900
- Okay.

1:02:19.669 --> 1:02:20.771
- I love you.

1:02:20.805 --> 1:02:22.672
- Baby you have no idea.

1:02:25.342 --> 1:02:26.911
(sirens wailing)
- Yes I hear the sirens.

1:02:26.944 --> 1:02:27.978
Thank you.

1:02:28.012 --> 1:02:29.246
Back stairs.

1:02:33.350 --> 1:02:34.919
Yes, I'll hold.

lights on in his room.
