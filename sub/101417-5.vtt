It's unsettling, having you

01:00.720 --> 01:03.200
Well, if Cheryl was turning up
in your life with Shep's cum,

01:03.280 --> 01:05.520
you'd be maximizing
your chances of success, too.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.080
It's the only way to make it stop.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.240
Why do you do it every day?

01:08.320 --> 01:10.600
You know you can only get pregnant
two days every month.

01:10.680 --> 01:11.520
What?

01:11.600 --> 01:12.960
Have you been tracking your cycle?

01:13.720 --> 01:15.520
Do you even know when you ovulate?

01:15.600 --> 01:18.200
No, I don't know when I ovulate.
What the hell?

01:18.280 --> 01:21.040
Why have they told us since high school
we can get knocked up anytime?

01:21.120 --> 01:22.200
Not where I studied.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.720
They'd say, "Remember, girls,
your mouth can't get pregnant."

01:24.800 --> 01:26.320
Did you go to school in an Usher video?

01:26.400 --> 01:28.480
So the good news is
we don't know if it's worked yet.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.160
Which means there might still be time
to back out.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.280
Why would I wanna back out?

01:32.360 --> 01:35.520
Don't you think it's odd that Cheryl's
so keen with these spunk deliveries?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.840
They're a newly-engaged couple,
they're at it a lot. Whatever.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.160

01:40.720 --> 01:43.480

Ooh, we love <i>The Handmaid's Tale,</i>
Brian and me.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.280
I mean, it makes sense.
She obviously can't have children.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.000
Just because a woman doesn't have children

01:53.080 --> 01:54.760
doesn't mean
she <i>can't </i>have children, Jane.

01:54.840 --> 01:55.680

her man's ex to have a baby with him...

02:05.520 --> 02:07.080

02:07.160 --> 02:08.120

you don't dress a child like an adult
