00:11.887 --> 00:13.722
<i>It was the first day
of senior year,</i>

00:13.847 --> 00:15.724
<i>and I woke up still drunk.</i>

00:16.099 --> 00:18.477
<i>The night before was mostly a blur.</i>

00:19.019 --> 00:21.813
<i>That is,
after I emptied out the entire minibar.</i>

00:21.980 --> 00:24.066
<i>If I had any chance of making it
through the day,</i>

00:24.149 --> 00:26.193
<i>I needed something to soak up the booze.</i>

00:26.818 --> 00:28.487
<i>"Went to Atlanta for AA retreat.</i>

00:28.946 --> 00:33.200
<i>Unreachable for four days.
Call if you need me. Smiley face, Mom.</i>

00:33.700 --> 00:34.785
<i>First day of school.</i>

00:35.327 --> 00:36.161
<i>Good job, Mom.</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:39.164
<i>But, with no mom, I could ditch.</i>

00:39.623 --> 00:42.793
<i>If I was gonna be a beauty queen,
only one teacher mattered.</i>

00:45.879 --> 00:48.382
I thought Magnolia wanted me
to coach her.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.509
I had no idea she wanted to seduce me.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.220
Well, you never should have put yourself
in that position.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.932
No grown man should have to jump
out of a teenage girl's window.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.475
We should tell her parents.

00:59.142 --> 01:00.978
If it were our daughter, I'd want to know.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.188
Are you insane?
You're an accused child molester.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.400
Plus, If you tell the Barnards,

01:06.483 --> 01:08.902
Etta Mae will never sponsor me
for Junior League.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.362
Heaven forbid.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.448
Please, Bob, no more coaching. Okay?

01:13.532 --> 01:18.495
Just focus on your legal career
with clients who are over 18.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.622
That blonde girl was a catastrophe.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.041
Showing up
at our gala looking like a whore.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.085
We are still working on Patty's look.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.753
No, we are not.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.630
Leave it alone.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.258
<i>Except I couldn't.</i>

01:31.425 --> 01:35.220
<i>Patty was my chance
to get my pageant coaching mojo back.</i>

01:35.679 --> 01:38.181
<i>I'd just have to keep things
on the down low.</i>

01:47.357 --> 01:49.318
I'm here.
I'm ready for you to make me a winner.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.486
And I brought donuts,
breakfast of champions.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.323
- Jesus, what happened to you?
- Nothing.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.784
Uh... I'm a little hungover.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.494
You... were drinking?

01:59.578 --> 02:03.040
Today is your first day of school.
You need to be fresh, alert.

02:03.290 --> 02:06.043
I'm not going.
Beauty queens don't need school.

02:06.418 --> 02:09.170
Okay. When is the last time
you heard of a beauty queen

02:09.253 --> 02:12.174
slash high school dropout
slash blackout drunk?

02:12.257 --> 02:13.800
Does your mom know you're here?

02:14.176 --> 02:17.512
She's out of town,
so I guess you're in charge of me now.

02:17.846 --> 02:18.972
Can I call you daddy?

02:19.222 --> 02:20.432
Absolutely not.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.854
What is that?

02:26.271 --> 02:27.230
Makeup caboodle.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.900
Let's get you cleaned up
and I'll take you to school.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.736
No. I haven't even eaten anything yet.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.907
Hey, give that back. I'm starving.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.241
Good.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.827
Maybe your body will start eating itself.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.589
I'm not ever going back there again.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.093
You want to talk about it?

03:05.644 --> 03:10.482
<i>Dear Blob Armstrong, you're fat!</i>

03:10.857 --> 03:11.983
Wow.

03:13.235 --> 03:14.069
You <i>were </i> fat.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.530
Until I wasn't.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.908
It gets better. I promise.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.787
Trust me, skinny is magic.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.997
You are not Fatty Patty anymore.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.624
So who am I, then?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.626
Whoever you wanna be.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.588
Today is the day
we write your pageant narrative,

03:33.672 --> 03:36.383
the story that you will tell
on the pageant stage.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.386
Who you are and why they should pick you.

03:39.469 --> 03:43.849
You can be the former fatty
turned class president,

03:43.932 --> 03:47.853
or cheerleader, or homecoming queen.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.896
You are a blank slate.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.024
So, let's make you a pretty picture.

03:57.988 --> 03:58.822
Uh-oh.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.241
I feel a makeover coming on.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.379
<i>Maybe Bob was right.</i>

04:14.546 --> 04:16.673
<i>I could write a whole new story.</i>

04:17.257 --> 04:18.716
<i>I felt like Cinderella,</i>

04:18.800 --> 04:22.387
<i>and there was my Prince Charming,
Brick Armstrong.</i>

04:22.471 --> 04:24.765
<i>Maybe my pageant narrative could be
like a fairy tale,</i>

04:24.848 --> 04:28.018
<i>where the vengeful maiden
rejects the hero, like he did to me.</i>

04:28.560 --> 04:29.394
Brick.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.901
Hey, babe.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.527
Patty.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.279
<i>So much for revenge.</i>

04:39.362 --> 04:40.781
You guys know each other?

04:41.281 --> 04:43.200
That's Patty Bladell.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.870
No way. Uh, Fatty Patty's huge.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.081
Just because you're skinny now

04:50.165 --> 04:52.626
doesn't mean you can steal
someone else's boyfriend.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.169
Got it?

04:56.880 --> 04:59.007
Oh, my God, that was sick.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.469
Magnolia Barnard was just totally
threatened by you.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.930
Oh, this is like every great
high school movie ever made.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.349
Geek turned chic. Mm-hmm?

05:07.432 --> 05:09.684
Is this the part where you dump me
for better friends

05:09.768 --> 05:11.770
and start sleeping with all the hot guys?

05:11.853 --> 05:12.687
Or girls?

05:12.938 --> 05:15.857
No, we are definitely not in that movie.

05:15.941 --> 05:16.858
Good.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.278
So, now... I <i>am </i> your boyfriend?

05:20.362 --> 05:22.864
'Cause last night,
you said you weren't sure.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.908
I'm not, but until I decide,

05:24.991 --> 05:26.827
I'm not letting you flirt
with some other girl.

05:26.910 --> 05:30.205
So, no other girls, got it.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.915
Brick, is there someone else?

05:31.998 --> 05:32.916
No way.

05:33.834 --> 05:34.668
I love you.

05:37.087 --> 05:39.881
Okay, that is literally the first time
you've ever said that to me.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.801
- Why'd it take you so long?
- I don't know.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.262
Maybe I was scared.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.722
I haven't said that to anyone before,
except for my mom.

05:58.108 --> 06:01.611
<i>For the first time in my life,
I was pure potential.</i>

06:01.736 --> 06:03.738
<i>The world was my oyster.</i>

06:03.947 --> 06:06.783
<i>I could be the former fatty
who turned into a brain.</i>

06:06.992 --> 06:08.618
<i>Or an athlete.</i>

06:09.286 --> 06:10.412
<i>Or a basket case.</i>

06:11.621 --> 06:12.998
<i>Or a princess.</i>

06:15.250 --> 06:16.459
<i>Or a criminal.</i>

06:16.543 --> 06:18.920
<i>Well, obviously, not a criminal.</i>

06:25.427 --> 06:27.304
We're discussing today's news.

06:27.596 --> 06:28.597
Mm-hmm?

06:28.972 --> 06:31.349
Some guy almost died in a fire
at the Halfway Inn.

06:33.894 --> 06:34.811
What hotel?

06:35.145 --> 06:37.063
The one by the freeway.
Halfway Inn.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.773
Guy's in, like, critical condition.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.651
<i>Oh, my God. Was I criminal?</i>

06:43.361 --> 06:48.617
<i>Could it be possible
that I am becoming a killer?</i>

06:49.284 --> 06:52.203
We need to go to the bathroom. Together.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.998
- Together.
- Together.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.670
I was at that motel last night,
with the homeless guy.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.464
Thank God you missed the fire.

07:02.714 --> 07:03.632
Totally.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.675
- Unless I didn't.
- What are you talking about?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.720
You know how I was gonna bang him,

07:08.803 --> 07:11.097
and then, I didn't,
so I still wanted revenge?

07:11.181 --> 07:13.016
Patty, what did you do?

07:13.308 --> 07:17.812
I may have briefly considered
lighting him on fire.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.648
Patty, are you insane?

07:19.731 --> 07:20.815
I don't know.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.568
I cleaned out the minibar,
I watched <i>Firestarter. </i> The rest is a blur.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.154
Wait, you watched <i>Firestarter</i> without me?

07:26.571 --> 07:27.572
I can't believe you.

07:27.656 --> 07:28.573
Nonnie!

07:29.032 --> 07:31.326
What if I got drunk
and set the guy on fire?

07:31.409 --> 07:32.285
What if he dies?

07:32.369 --> 07:34.621
Okay, okay.
Let's think about this logically.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.414
There's someone in critical condition,

07:36.498 --> 07:38.375
but we don't know
if it's your homeless guy.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.417
Yeah, totally.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.003
You... You really think
that it could be just a coincidence?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.881
That I thought
about lighting a guy on fire,

07:44.965 --> 07:46.967
and then a different guy was in a fire

07:47.050 --> 07:49.219
at the motel where I thought
about lighting a guy on fire,

07:49.302 --> 07:51.596
but it was a different guy
and a different fire?

07:51.888 --> 07:53.014
It's possible.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.349
- Yeah.
- I'll ditch,

07:54.432 --> 07:56.393
go to the hospital, and find out.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.727
You should stay here.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.230
My dad says the easiest way
to catch a murderer is to see

08:00.313 --> 08:01.564
who comes to visit the victim.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.526
- I'm a murderer?
- Only if he dies.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.571
Nonnie, what am I supposed to do?
Just wait around?

08:08.655 --> 08:10.031
Go to class. Blend.

08:10.115 --> 08:13.493
Pretend you're a normal teenager.
Who knows, you actually might be.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.286
I'll text you later.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.254
Bob, hi.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.799
I didn't expect to see you at home.
I came to see Etta Mae.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.050
Etta Mae's out of town.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.594
Another surgery.
Separating conjoined twins.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.096
You must be so proud.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.764
If I only had the time.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.600
Look, I'm already an hour late for work,
and I'm out of fresh shirts.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.395
Oh, well, I could press a shirt for you.
I could straighten up the house, too.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.149
Now, why on God's green earth
would you do that?

08:44.232 --> 08:46.359
Well, it's the neighborly thing to do,

08:46.443 --> 08:50.697
and I'm sure Etta Mae would appreciate
knowing that you are well cared for.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.950
Well, well, that's awfully nice of you.
Come on in.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.411
Just don't judge, okay?
The house is a mess.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.543
<i>I was anxious.</i>

09:03.626 --> 09:05.920
<i>Stressed. Paralyzed with fear.</i>

09:06.004 --> 09:08.548
<i>Sure, I was scared I might be
a murdering arsonist,</i>

09:08.631 --> 09:12.177
<i>but that was nothing compared
to facing a high school cafeteria.</i>

09:12.510 --> 09:14.512
<i>Nonnie told me to blend in.</i>

09:14.679 --> 09:16.222
<i>Be inconspicuous.</i>

09:16.973 --> 09:19.309
<i>I was used to being invisible.</i>

09:19.392 --> 09:21.394
<i>I needed to find a place to hide out.</i>

09:21.561 --> 09:26.274
<i>A group of kids nobody cared about,
but not with those sadists from the band.</i>

09:43.041 --> 09:44.375
Oh!

09:44.834 --> 09:46.044
<i>Maybe the stoners.</i>

09:46.127 --> 09:48.963
<i>Maybe this time they'd be too baked
to even notice me.</i>

09:50.965 --> 09:52.050
Watch it, Patty.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.468
Sorry.

09:54.636 --> 09:58.640
You know what rhymes with Patty?
Fatty. Fatty Patty!

09:58.723 --> 10:00.475
<i>I wasn't Fatty Patty anymore.</i>

10:00.558 --> 10:03.353
<i>I needed to find a place
where the new me fit in.</i>

10:08.066 --> 10:09.651
Yes, you, come here.

10:09.734 --> 10:14.114
<i>For the first time in my life,
could I actually be popular?</i>

10:14.614 --> 10:17.534
<i>I couldn't go to jail.
I finally get to sit at the cool table.</i>

10:17.617 --> 10:18.868
So are you new?

10:19.744 --> 10:22.413
Uh, definitely on the outside.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.957
Welcome to Masonville.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.627
Hey, Alicia, have you met, um...

10:32.674 --> 10:33.842
I'm sorry, who are you?

10:35.301 --> 10:36.553
I don't know.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.930
Excuse me.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.977
<i>Maybe everybody else had forgotten
about Fatty Patty,</i>

10:44.060 --> 10:45.562
<i>but I couldn't let her go.</i>

10:45.854 --> 10:47.772
So, I have to go.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.816
- I just got called in on a case.
- Ah.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.025
A personal favor.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.027
Okay.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.614
So should I lock up when I leave, then,
or what?

10:56.698 --> 10:57.991
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Okay.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.994
If you need me to return the favor,
don't hesitate to ask.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.038
- Oh.
- Thanks, Coralee, you're a real peach.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.915
Ah.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.544
Uh...

11:09.711 --> 11:11.588
- Have a good one.
- All right.

11:52.003 --> 11:52.962
Regina?

12:25.578 --> 12:26.955
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:27.038 --> 12:31.084
I'm here with Masonville High's
Caring for a Cause Alliance,

12:31.167 --> 12:34.212
and we heard there was a guy
in a fire who's in the ICU.

12:34.295 --> 12:37.090
- I brought him a little something.
- Yeah, straight ahead. Room 102.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.216
Thank you.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.351
Nonnie?

12:52.063 --> 12:53.106
Dad.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.233
Everything okay?
Why aren't you in school?

12:55.316 --> 12:57.986
Yeah, I'm just here doing research
for an assignment.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.946
- You?
- Official police business.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.781
There was a fire,
and it's looking like arson.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.199
Arson?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.785
There's a guy who got caught in it.
Bad liver, weak heart.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.578
With that smoke inhalation,
he could die,

13:07.662 --> 13:09.372
which would make this a homicide.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.957
My first ever.

13:11.040 --> 13:11.874
Awesome, right?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.751
Not for the dead guy.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.337
Oh, yeah, no, no. No, no, of course. Uh...

13:16.421 --> 13:18.381
You gotta admit, I mean, it's pretty cool.

13:18.506 --> 13:22.427
- Nothing ever happens in this town.
- So, do you guys have any suspects?

13:22.510 --> 13:25.930
Not officially. He was with a girl.
Night clerk saw them check in together.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.892
- Do you have a description of her?
- Sorry.

13:30.101 --> 13:33.187
Can't say any more
without compromising the investigation.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.077
So, I'm new. Are you?

13:48.369 --> 13:49.245
Uh...

13:51.080 --> 13:51.956
No.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.959
Why are you sitting alone?
You steal somebody's boyfriend?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.587
Girlfriend?

13:57.670 --> 14:00.173
- Why did you think that I would...
- 'Cause I know how things work.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.383
If a girl as hot as you is sitting alone,

14:03.009 --> 14:05.386
she's new or a social pariah.

14:06.012 --> 14:10.099
<i>Did the hottest guy I've ever seen
besides Brick Armstrong just call me hot?</i>

14:10.183 --> 14:13.102
So what happened? Did you, like,
light someone on fire or something?

14:14.270 --> 14:15.146
I'm Christian.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.650
That's my name and my religion,
which is super annoying and on the nose,

14:19.734 --> 14:22.779
but... my dad's a preacher

14:23.196 --> 14:24.238
and a missionary,

14:24.322 --> 14:26.115
hence I've been
to five different high schools.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.535
This is the part
where you tell me your name.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.120
And your backstory.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.246
I'm Patty.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.040
No backstory.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.376
I like a woman of mystery.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.798
<i>I'd never been a woman of mystery
in my life,</i>

14:41.881 --> 14:43.299
<i>but I wasn't about to tell him that.</i>

14:44.842 --> 14:46.636
Why do you need to get a lawyer?

14:56.854 --> 14:58.231
You are so fucked.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.818
Ooh, is this one
of those afternoon delight kinda visits?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.027
In the bad way.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.113
Regina had you followed.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.490
Where in the hell did you get these?

15:07.573 --> 15:10.159
You better tell Barnard the truth
and get out in front of it.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.495
I wanted to do that this morning.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.163
You made me promise not to.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.875
It's too late. If I tell him now,
it's gonna seem like I'm covering.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.293
We gotta figure out another way.

15:19.377 --> 15:20.753
Well, you need to figure it out.

15:20.837 --> 15:23.840
I'm not the one who can't stay away
from teenage girls.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.053
Oh.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.433
I should probably pick that up.
It could be an emergency.

15:33.891 --> 15:34.809
About what?

15:34.892 --> 15:37.186
Her first day of school.
She was really scared.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.688
And how do you know that?

15:38.771 --> 15:42.108
Because... I saw her this morning.
I gave her a makeover.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.986
My God, Bob! You are pathological.

15:45.403 --> 15:49.615
Please, please, no more Patty, okay?
There is something off about that girl.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.034
I am telling you, you are wrong.

15:52.118 --> 15:52.994
Hello?

15:53.077 --> 15:54.912
<i>I think I may have killed someone.</i>

15:55.371 --> 15:56.664
I gotta go.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.792
My life just started.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.462
I... I don't want it to be over already.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.428
I'm a horrible person.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.596
You're not.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.223
I wanted to hurt him.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.478
<i>I had to do something.
She was ruining my $1,500 jacket.</i>

16:18.561 --> 16:21.564
- Listen to me, Patty.
- Mm-hmm?

16:21.647 --> 16:24.901
Having a murderous thought is not the same
as having murderous intent.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.194
That is not who you are.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.571
How do you know?

16:28.654 --> 16:32.450
Because I see you.
Because I see what's really in your heart.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.576
I saw it first.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.415
We are gonna prove
you didn't do this, together.

16:40.541 --> 16:41.834
All of us.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.755
You, we've got to jog your memory, hmm?

16:45.838 --> 16:46.714
I need you to go back

16:46.797 --> 16:49.467
and mentally retrace your steps
from last night.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.636
Maybe you can fill in the blanks,

16:51.719 --> 16:53.596
remember something
that'll let you off the hook.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.474
But stay away from the motel, hmm?

16:57.433 --> 16:58.768
And stay out of trouble.

16:58.976 --> 16:59.852
Got it?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.522
You sure about this?

17:02.605 --> 17:05.775
Yes. Bob said to reenact the events
of last night.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.859
- I thought he said "mentally retrace"?
- Uh-uh-uh.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.738
Trust me, my dad's a cop.
Anything could trigger a memory.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.031
I'll be the homeless guy.

17:13.991 --> 17:17.453
So, did you guys kiss?
Because maybe we should.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.121
No, we didn't kiss.

17:19.747 --> 17:23.542
Well, was he on top of you or...?

17:23.626 --> 17:26.671
I'm telling you,
the last thing I remember was <i>Firestarter.</i>

17:26.753 --> 17:30.091
And the vodka. Then, it went black.

17:30.174 --> 17:34.136
Okay, first of all, I can't even
with <i>Firestarter. </i> It hurts too much.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.054
Sorry.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.847
What were you wearing last night?

17:37.431 --> 17:39.225
You know what I was wearing. Those.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.149
Aha. A clue.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.317
Cheetos?

17:48.442 --> 17:50.111
- I never eat Cheetos.
- Oh, yeah?

17:50.194 --> 17:51.487
Let me see your hands.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.446
What?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.784
I knew it. Orange residue.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.036
I don't think that that...

18:01.581 --> 18:03.457
Yep, Cheetos for sure.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.377
You must have been hungry
and gone out for a snack.

18:07.003 --> 18:09.380
The Booze 'N Stuff is right by that motel.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.466
We should go over there.
Find out who was working.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.343
See if you said anything
about what you did.

18:14.635 --> 18:17.680
Oh, my God,
you're pretty good at this.

18:17.763 --> 18:21.267
- You should be a cop like your dad.
- I don't know, that's kinda dykey.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.319
<i>I needed Patty to be innocent.</i>

18:31.444 --> 18:35.031
<i>Without her, my coaching career
would be nothing but a distant memory.</i>

18:35.448 --> 18:38.784
<i>But as her lawyer,
I needed to assume the worst.</i>

18:41.037 --> 18:44.790
<i>What I didn't need was
Bob Box o' Butt Plugs Barnard</i>

18:44.874 --> 18:47.418
<i>and his giant ego getting in my way.</i>

18:47.752 --> 18:51.172
Since when does a DA get involved
in an active investigation?

18:51.255 --> 18:54.050
'Cause I knew the victim.
He was a witness in a case I had.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.511
- I know. I was opposing counsel.
- You were?

18:59.513 --> 19:02.224
You really shouldn't be here.
This is a probable crime scene.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.435
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get to work.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.313
Bob, seriously?

19:07.521 --> 19:09.440
It's wall-to-wall soot in there.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.400
I wouldn't wanna soil my shirt.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.570
Especially after your wife
was kind enough to iron it for me.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.905
She what?

19:16.864 --> 19:19.575
Yeah, Etta Mae's outta town.
So, Coralee helped me out.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.576
She didn't tell you?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.286
<i>I'm not sure which was worse.</i>

19:22.370 --> 19:27.500
<i>The thought of my wife ironing a shirt
for Bob Bulging-Bicep Barnard</i>

19:27.583 --> 19:30.544
<i>or the fact that the only way
to get anything out of Barnard</i>

19:30.628 --> 19:32.296
<i>was to suck up to his ego.</i>

19:32.380 --> 19:34.548
<i>I'd rather light myself on fire.</i>

19:35.091 --> 19:36.258
Listen, Bob.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.887
I don't have any experience with arson,

19:39.970 --> 19:43.015
and I... I was hoping
you could bend the rules

19:43.099 --> 19:47.061
so I could learn from a real professional.

19:47.144 --> 19:50.690
Well, heck, when you put it like that.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.818
What good is it being the top
law enforcement officer in four counties

19:53.901 --> 19:57.488
if you can't throw a bone to your old pal
and courtroom adversary, huh?

19:57.571 --> 19:59.573
You're a peach.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.368
Don't touch anything.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.872
You don't remember anything?

20:07.623 --> 20:09.834
No. I was totally shit-faced.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.128
Was she acting weird,
like she did something bad?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.630
She was bad, for sure.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.299
Okay, so I came in
and I bought Cheetos, right?

20:17.800 --> 20:18.884
Flamin' hot.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.137
Did she smell like smoke,
like from a fire?

20:21.303 --> 20:25.433
No, but she was definitely... smokin'.

20:27.810 --> 20:30.354
- Tell me what happened.
- You showed me your titties.

20:30.438 --> 20:31.313
What?

20:31.480 --> 20:34.859
I reminded you that you still owed me
for lying for you in court.

20:34.942 --> 20:38.028
- So, you showed me your...
- Did we hook up?

20:38.112 --> 20:40.364
No. I thought we were going to,

20:40.448 --> 20:43.534
but you got kinda mad when I asked
why you weren't wearing a bra.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.747
- I wasn't wearing a bra?
- Where was your bra?

20:47.830 --> 20:51.125
FYI, my sister says going braless
is bad for your back.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.209
Shut up, Choi.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.466
I must have left my bra in the bathroom.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.050
I thought you guys didn't hook up.

21:00.134 --> 21:04.138
I went there to seduce him, remember?
So, I had to free up some assets.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.097
Wow.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.475
The old Patty wouldn't even change
her shirt in front of me.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.769
Now you're getting motorboated
by homeless guys

21:09.852 --> 21:11.520
and hooking up with Donald Choi.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.522
Who said anything about motorboating?

21:14.148 --> 21:17.735
If the police took my bra into evidence,
they can place me at the crime scene.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.361
Mm. Only with DNA.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.198
- So, unless you have nipple hair.
- Who has nipple hair?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.699
Definitely not me.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.326
I'm gonna spend my life in prison.

21:25.409 --> 21:28.704
And then, I'll never see Bob again,
and I'll never be a beauty queen,

21:28.788 --> 21:31.457
and I'll never be able to talk
to that hot guy from school.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.458
Who, Brick?

21:32.541 --> 21:36.337
No, this new guy. His name's Christian.
He's the hottest guy I've ever seen.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.922
And he called me hot.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.131
You are hot.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.925
Not after prison, I won't be.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.677
I'm gonna have shiv scars
and tattoos and PTSD.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.554
Okay, calm down.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.681
We'll just go and get your bra back.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.892
I know the evidence clerk,
Mrs. Freyberger.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.894
My dad used to have her watch me
when I was little.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.896
I'll distract her,
and you can go get the bra.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.397
Oh, my God, amazing.

21:56.357 --> 21:59.193
These were just taken
on a hunting trip I took to Alaska.

21:59.276 --> 22:03.739
That bear counts as a double kill
'cause it was preggers when I drilled it.

22:03.823 --> 22:04.990
Unfortunately,

22:05.074 --> 22:07.785
- you can't wall mount a bear fetus.
- Mm-hmm.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.538
Oh! Look at that.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.502
<i>I wanted to be a winner.</i>

22:16.961 --> 22:20.130
<i>Not a flasher, a thief,
and potentially a murderer.</i>

22:20.881 --> 22:24.176
<i>At this point, I didn't know who
or what I was.</i>

22:26.178 --> 22:28.222
<i>If I were a bra, where would I be?</i>

22:31.308 --> 22:32.893
All right, here's what we know.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.437
The victim did not check in alone.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.649
He was with a young blonde woman. 36DD.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.651
You know the cup size?

22:40.734 --> 22:43.362
We found her bra in the bathroom.
She's the number one suspect.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.948
- For what?
- Arson, Bob, keep up.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.826
Now, the battery was removed
from the smoke detector.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.161
That means there was intent.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.415
Now, Captain Murray determined
the fire was started by a match

22:54.498 --> 22:56.876
dropped onto the bed,
which was doused with vodka.

22:57.167 --> 23:00.963
And our victim was found unconscious
in the bathroom.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.591
Probably ran over here
to avoid getting burned.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.635
Banged his head.

23:06.719 --> 23:10.431
<i>Every detail matched Patty's story,
except for the blood.</i>

23:10.848 --> 23:12.808
<i>It was like watching a horror movie,</i>

23:12.892 --> 23:15.853
<i>and wondering if your protégé
was Freddy Krueger.</i>

23:15.936 --> 23:18.147
<i>If I had any chance at redemption,</i>

23:18.230 --> 23:23.527
<i>Patty was gonna need an alibi as solid
as the abs on Bob Bra-Burglar Barnard.</i>

23:38.167 --> 23:39.710
What the fu...

23:43.088 --> 23:44.256
How did you get those?

23:44.340 --> 23:47.968
- They were for Bob Barnard's eyes only.
- Never mind, I'm here as a friend.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.055
I'm fed up
with my husband's depraved behavior.

23:51.472 --> 23:53.098
I want out of the marriage.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.351
- Get in.
- Okay.

23:59.313 --> 24:00.272
Hi.

24:00.814 --> 24:02.149
Oh, wow.

24:02.232 --> 24:04.860
Oh, girl.
It's about time you came to your senses.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.820
- I know, but I need your help.
- Okay.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.698
I'm assuming these aren't the only copies
of the photos.

24:09.782 --> 24:10.616
No.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.952
I have them on my phone, why?

24:13.035 --> 24:15.204
Because if I show these to Bob,
he'll destroy them.

24:15.871 --> 24:19.625
So would you mind texting them to me
as backup?

24:19.708 --> 24:21.794
Oh, no, my pleasure.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.545
- People say you're a bitch.
- I know.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.297
- But you're the sweetest.
- Thank you.

24:25.381 --> 24:26.423
- Honey...
- You're welcome.

24:26.507 --> 24:30.636
I hope you take that pervert husband
of yours for everything that he is worth,

24:30.970 --> 24:33.013
right down to his fruity little caboodle.

24:33.305 --> 24:34.264
Got 'em!

24:34.556 --> 24:37.226
Oh, thank you, Regina.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.520
Now, I'm assuming you don't know this,

24:39.603 --> 24:42.481
but you're guilty of trafficking
in child pornography.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.066
- Wait. What?
- Uh-huh.

24:44.149 --> 24:47.152
It's illegal to text lewd photos
of a minor,

24:47.236 --> 24:49.113
which Magnolia most certainly is.

24:49.196 --> 24:54.034
- Now you wait just one minute...
- Let me be real clear, Regina.

24:54.118 --> 24:54.952
It's Regina.

24:55.035 --> 24:59.289
I love, love my husband,
fruity caboodle and all.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.959
So, you will drop this
or I will go to the police.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.878
Oh, yeah. Oh, you go to the police.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.088
Try me.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.339
Whore-alee!

25:07.423 --> 25:08.757
Regina vagina!

25:08.841 --> 25:11.468
- No, it's Regina like a Gina, not a Gyna.
- Whatever, bye.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.523
<i>There it was. The smoking bra.</i>

25:31.321 --> 25:33.699
Hey, babe... Bob. Any news?

25:33.782 --> 25:34.783
<i>It's not lookin' good.</i>

25:34.867 --> 25:36.910
The police are lookin'
for a young blonde woman,

25:36.994 --> 25:40.039
and Bob Bukkake Barnard has made
this case his personal mission.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.665
Wait, what's bukkake?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.251
Never mind. Where are you?

25:44.334 --> 25:46.920
I'm in the evidence locker,
in the police station.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.089
- Nonnie's helping me cover my tracks.
- What? What?

25:49.173 --> 25:51.925
No. I told you to stay out of trouble.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.387
<i>Get out and don't take anything.
They keep a list of all the evidence.</i>

25:55.596 --> 25:56.597
<i>Shit, they do?</i>

25:56.680 --> 25:58.098
Yeah, you need an alibi.

25:58.182 --> 26:00.768
<i>The hallway fire alarm went off
at 12:04 a.m.</i>

26:00.851 --> 26:03.771
You need proof you were somewhere else
during that time frame.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.648
Wait. I think I was at the Booze 'n Stuff.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.193
Those places have security camera footage,
right?

26:09.276 --> 26:11.487
I bet I can get Donald Choi
to give it to me.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.905
He's kinda got a thing for me.

26:12.988 --> 26:16.700
<i>Does it mean that I'm not a murderer
and can go back to a normal life?</i>

26:16.784 --> 26:19.995
I could be Miss American Lady,
and everyone will be so jealous.

26:20.079 --> 26:23.415
Okay, yeah, that's great.
Listen, call me when you get the footage.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.501
I'm going to the hospital
to check on homeless guy.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.256
Good news.

26:32.216 --> 26:35.260
I found a matchbook wedged
between the wall and the mattress.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.679
Captain Murray was able to lift
partial prints.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.932
Mm, yay, Captain Murray.

26:40.140 --> 26:42.226
I'm betting it belongs to the blonde.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.436
Off to run it through the database.

26:52.277 --> 26:53.529
Uh, where's Donald?

26:53.612 --> 26:56.323
He had urgent business.
Something I can help you with?

26:57.783 --> 27:00.119
Yeah, this is gonna sound weird,

27:00.202 --> 27:02.204
but I have to prove
that I was here last night.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.706
Would you mind if I looked
at your security footage?

27:05.082 --> 27:07.626
Yes, I mind. This is a place of business.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.003
- I don't have time for games.
- What if I bought something?

27:10.462 --> 27:11.380
Okay.

27:14.591 --> 27:15.759
That's odd.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.554
The thumb drive
with the footage is missing.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.850
<i>The was only one person
who could've stolen that footage.</i>

27:23.851 --> 27:27.020
That porn-hoarder Choi stole my aliboob.

27:27.104 --> 27:29.565
We have to find him.
We're running out of time.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.192
Wait, isn't that his car?

27:37.114 --> 27:39.658
Ah, unicorns and rainbows.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.493
That is an invasion of privacy.

27:41.910 --> 27:46.039
You're jerking off in a public parking lot
to a video of my back.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.792
- I was not.
- Then what were you doing?

27:48.876 --> 27:50.627
Jerking off to the memory of your front.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.964
Give us the security footage,
and we won't tell everyone you were

27:54.047 --> 27:56.425
in your car, punching the clown.

28:08.562 --> 28:12.149
Shit! 12:05, that's ten minutes
after the fire started.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.734
It still doesn't exonerate me.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.444
Hold on.

28:15.736 --> 28:18.071
If we can prove that,
running at full speed,

28:18.155 --> 28:20.657
it took you longer than ten minutes
to get here from the motel,

28:20.741 --> 28:21.909
you'll be off the hook.

28:21.992 --> 28:25.829
We have to replicate the exact conditions
or the results won't be reliable.

28:26.163 --> 28:27.456
I'm confused.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.374
We're gonna get you drunk

28:29.458 --> 28:32.669
and time how long it takes for you to run
from the motel to here.

28:32.920 --> 28:33.962
Sound good?

28:34.046 --> 28:35.923
<i>I'd been drunk more
in the past two days</i>

28:36.006 --> 28:38.008
<i>than I had ever been in my life.</i>

28:38.091 --> 28:42.262
<i>Was skinny really magic or a gateway
to becoming a raging alcoholic?</i>

28:42.346 --> 28:44.306
- Rock and roll.
- Okay...

28:44.723 --> 28:45.557
Go!

28:47.684 --> 28:51.271
Oh, my God. Just go straight.
That's not the way to Booze 'n Stuff.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.356
- Patty?
- Patty?

28:52.439 --> 28:54.066
- Ow.
- Patty!

28:56.151 --> 28:58.695
- <i>Patty can't talk right now, Bob.</i>
- Who's this?

28:58.779 --> 29:00.447
Nonnie, her best friend.

29:00.530 --> 29:01.990
- Since we were three.
<i>- Well,</i>

29:02.199 --> 29:03.742
tell her homeless guy woke up.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.078
He's still groggy,
but he seems to be coming out of it.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.372
Until we know exactly what he has to say,

29:08.455 --> 29:11.041
she needs to stay as far away
from the hospital as possible.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.002
Um that's gonna be tough.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.841
Patty sort of had to get
her stomach pumped, so...

29:20.384 --> 29:21.426
Balls!

29:28.725 --> 29:31.353
Why do we always have to do it
in your car?

29:31.436 --> 29:34.106
Having my face smooshed up
against the window like that

29:34.189 --> 29:35.649
is breaking down my collagen.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.401
Is that like an old lady thing?

29:37.693 --> 29:38.944
Everyone has it.

29:39.945 --> 29:43.282
Look, we need to talk.
Me and Magnolia are getting back together.

29:43.991 --> 29:46.743
So? I didn't think we were exclusive.

29:46.827 --> 29:48.829
I mean, we can't keep doing this.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.456
So, what?

29:52.040 --> 29:54.835
- You waited to tell me until after...
- Yeah.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.087
Obviously. I'm not stupid.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.714
Oh, honey, yes, you are.

29:59.464 --> 30:02.134
Take me home. I don't wanna miss
<i>Little Women of Atlanta.</i>

30:13.437 --> 30:16.106
Don't you know that it's dangerous
to text and drive?

30:18.692 --> 30:19.776
What are you doin'?

30:19.860 --> 30:21.737
My shirt's on inside out.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.573
Don't need Dixie knowin'
I've been getting it on.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.117
Okay, stop, 'cause if someone sees,
then I'm...

30:27.200 --> 30:28.952
It's their lucky day.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.038
Shit!

30:38.086 --> 30:42.257
Oh, God. I can't be here! Oh!

30:42.966 --> 30:45.469
I am the number ten realtor
in this county!

30:45.552 --> 30:47.095
I don't like this shit!

30:47.554 --> 30:48.805
Damn clay!

30:48.930 --> 30:50.849
The fucking valley!

30:50.932 --> 30:55.437
I'm so sorry.
I feel like this is all my fault.

30:55.562 --> 30:59.441
No, no,
this is the most fun I've ever had.

31:00.275 --> 31:04.154
You and I just used to sit at home,
and now we're out in the world.

31:05.447 --> 31:08.909
I just hope I don't go to jail,
and it all goes away.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.494
No, hey, hey, hey.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.374
Hi, handsome.

31:15.457 --> 31:16.750
Jesus, girls.

31:16.875 --> 31:21.546
I asked you to get a time code.
Would it kill you to just listen?

31:21.922 --> 31:23.256
I saw Donald Choi's peen.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.927
- It's true. It was horrible.
- I'd never seen a peen before.

31:27.010 --> 31:30.305
Okay, bigger fish to fry. Hmm?
I checked in with the DA.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.515
The DA?

31:31.598 --> 31:33.016
Bob Bukkake Barnard.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.435
Don't you ever call him that.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.773
He is on his way down here
to question the homeless guy.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.359
I have to get to him first
to try and do damage control.

31:42.442 --> 31:45.028
Your dad is in the room.
You think you can distract him?

31:45.112 --> 31:47.572
Yeah, he's my dad.
I think I can manage it.

31:48.365 --> 31:49.950
Sorry. Do you have a problem with me?

31:51.159 --> 31:53.703
Patty, you stay here.
We cannot let the homeless guy see you.

31:53.787 --> 31:56.039
- But, I wanna...
- Patty, stay!

32:00.377 --> 32:01.753
Let me ask you something.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.922
You've known Patty since she was three.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.216
Do you think she could be capable
of something like this?

32:06.299 --> 32:09.845
Well, she's definitely different
now that she's skinny,

32:10.595 --> 32:12.305
but she's got her head on straight.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.603
I missed you guys.

32:18.770 --> 32:19.771
Oh, my God.

32:19.855 --> 32:22.691
You cannot follow directions
to save your life.

32:23.150 --> 32:24.317
Literally.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.779
Go back in there, lure your father out.
I'll take care of her.

32:28.613 --> 32:29.948
- Patty.
- Bob.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.367
Go back to the ER, now.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.370
That's her.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.290
That's the girl I was with last night.

32:38.373 --> 32:39.666
She started the fire.

32:41.084 --> 32:42.210
Patty?

32:43.253 --> 32:44.588
You better come in here.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.968
Were you with this man
at the motel last night?

32:50.927 --> 32:52.012
Tell him, blondie.

32:53.180 --> 32:54.848
I'm Ms. Bladell's attorney.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.558
I would like to postpone any questioning

32:56.641 --> 32:59.311
until my client
and I have a chance to confer.

32:59.853 --> 33:01.605
Confer about what? She did it.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.816
<i>Couldn't be true.</i>

33:04.900 --> 33:06.860
<i>For me or for her.</i>

33:08.111 --> 33:09.863
<i>I was grasping at straws.</i>

33:13.325 --> 33:16.161
<i>Suddenly, I knew what I was looking for.</i>

33:17.621 --> 33:20.457
Hey, what are you doin'?
Stop touching my stuff.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.542
Were you wearing these clothes
the night of the fire?

33:22.751 --> 33:24.961
- Yeah, but...
- Ah!

33:25.378 --> 33:28.924
I think we both know what really happened,
homeless guy.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.343
My name is John.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.053
Hey.

33:33.720 --> 33:37.349
You woke up, drunk, alone,

33:38.141 --> 33:41.019
your clothes in the bed,
soaked in spilled liquor.

33:41.102 --> 33:43.438
Just another day
in the life of a derelict.

33:43.688 --> 33:48.443
And then, creature of habit,
you reached for a cigarette.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.612
But before you could light it,

33:50.695 --> 33:53.532
you looked up
and saw a smoke alarm above the bed.

33:53.823 --> 33:57.494
But you weren't gonna let that stop you.
You decided to disarm it.

33:57.577 --> 33:58.453
You jumped up...

33:59.746 --> 34:02.666
and you removed the battery,
slipping it into your pocket.

34:02.749 --> 34:08.755
And then, you lit your cigarette,
dropping a match to the bed.

34:11.466 --> 34:15.136
You jumped off the bed,
ran to the bathroom to escape the flames,

34:15.219 --> 34:17.931
but you ran into the doorjamb
and knocked yourself unconscious.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.110
And then, you lied...

34:31.069 --> 34:34.822
and blamed Patty
so you didn't get in trouble...

34:35.322 --> 34:36.741
for starting the fire.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.077
How could you know all that?

34:39.619 --> 34:40.829
Were you in the closet?

34:40.911 --> 34:42.455
That sounds like a confession.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.000
Oh, fuck it.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.043
Yeah, it was me.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.422
<i>Because of Bob, I had a future.</i>

34:51.590 --> 34:53.341
<i>There was hope for a new me.</i>

34:53.425 --> 34:55.885
<i>My pageant story wasn't over yet.</i>

34:56.011 --> 34:57.012
I'm not a monster.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.639
No, you're my great white hope.

35:00.056 --> 35:02.892
That... sounds a little racist.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.980
We are gonna do amazing things.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.316
Bukkake.

35:10.483 --> 35:13.695
Okay. Let's get to the bottom of this.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.281
Already done, Bob.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.824
Already done.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.746
I gotta go home.
My son's been in a fender bender.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.372
Texting and driving.

35:24.456 --> 35:27.292
Nonnie, can you make sure
Patty gets discharged and get her home?

35:27.459 --> 35:29.669
Yeah, I'm always there for her.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.255
And never say "discharge."

35:33.798 --> 35:37.344
We're gonna start coaching this weekend.
You get home and go straight to bed.

35:37.427 --> 35:40.013
- Think you can handle that?
- Mm-hmm.

35:40.096 --> 35:42.849
Um... thank you for saving me.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.268
What about me?

35:49.230 --> 35:51.691
So much for the first day of senior year.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.526
We'll have a do-over tomorrow.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.070
Put this all behind us.

35:57.614 --> 35:59.616
<i>But I couldn't put it behind me.</i>

35:59.699 --> 36:00.784
<i>Not yet.</i>

36:01.159 --> 36:02.952
<i>There was one more thing I had to do.</i>

36:03.036 --> 36:04.120
I'll be right back.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.581
Wait, where are you going?

36:07.666 --> 36:08.500
Patty.

36:11.211 --> 36:14.172
Just so you know,
I'm the fatty you punched.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.715
You broke my jaw.

36:16.216 --> 36:18.593
I couldn't eat solid food
for three months.

36:19.386 --> 36:20.887
So you owe me an apology.

36:21.304 --> 36:22.681
An... an apology?

36:23.348 --> 36:24.891
You should be thanking me.

36:25.392 --> 36:28.144
I saved you.
Because of me, you got skinny.

36:28.770 --> 36:31.189
Skinny isn't magic.

36:32.107 --> 36:35.485
It doesn't take away all of the years
that I got treated like shit.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.529
- Well, let it go.
- I can't!

36:38.571 --> 36:43.201
I might be skinny on the outside,
but on the inside, I'm still Fatty Patty.

36:43.284 --> 36:47.414
- That's pathetic.
- Oh, I want you to hurt, like I hurt.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.583
You deserve it.
I wish I had lit your ass on fire.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.877
I hope you drop fucking dead.

36:59.718 --> 37:03.805
<i>I wanted him dead,
and then he was.</i>

37:04.389 --> 37:06.641
<i>And I... was happy.</i>

37:08.059 --> 37:10.061
<i>Did that make me a horrible person?</i>

37:10.437 --> 37:13.314
<i>Did it make me responsible?</i>

37:14.607 --> 37:18.194
<i>Maybe Bob was right.
Maybe skinny </i> was <i>magic.</i>

37:20.613 --> 37:22.490
<i>I wondered what else I could do.</i>
