WEBVTT

00:32.220 --> 00:33.887
- Where's the food and water?

00:33.920 --> 00:36.754
Where is it, before
I fuck you up!

00:40.720 --> 00:43.820
Yeah, I'd be scared
too if I was you.

02:20.920 --> 02:24.154
Now I don't want to use this
on you for target practice...

02:24.187 --> 02:25.020
But...

02:27.587 --> 02:30.120
These are my only pair
of pants, and I tore em'.

02:30.154 --> 02:30.987
See?

02:32.920 --> 02:36.487
Now I know you got a sewing
kit in here somewhere.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.887
You're probably
hiding it somewhere,

02:37.920 --> 02:40.020
but I'm smarter than you.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.854
Pens, no...

02:44.887 --> 02:47.420
End processing paperwork?

02:47.454 --> 02:49.087
Pillows, poncho, no...

02:50.587 --> 02:51.887
Flashlights, no...

02:55.587 --> 02:56.420
Ah!

03:02.020 --> 03:04.654
- [Robot] Red Cross services.

03:05.754 --> 03:06.587
- Oh shit!

03:07.754 --> 03:09.754
You got something to
say, motherfucker?

03:09.787 --> 03:10.854
You've been quiet
for three months,

03:10.887 --> 03:13.820
and now you got
something to say?

03:15.020 --> 03:17.887
I'm gonna take what
I want, when I want!

03:17.920 --> 03:20.520
And you can't do shit about it.

03:34.309 --> 03:37.775
(somber instrumental music)

04:16.475 --> 04:20.242
(hopeful instrumental music)

09:50.575 --> 09:53.542
(hopeful piano music)

11:42.673 --> 11:45.639
(glass breaking)

11:47.606 --> 11:50.539
(tires screeching)

11:51.873 --> 11:53.506
Mad Max, bitch!

11:53.539 --> 11:55.873
(gunshots)

11:55.906 --> 11:59.106
(maniacal laughing)

12:12.373 --> 12:13.739
I'm here, motherfuckas!

12:13.773 --> 12:15.673
Who's ready for school?

12:29.673 --> 12:30.506
Hey...

12:31.673 --> 12:33.639
You remember that time
Billie Jo came down

12:33.673 --> 12:36.706
to the supermarket
and she asked me

12:36.739 --> 12:39.539
where the cucumbers were?

12:39.573 --> 12:41.573
I got em' right here.

12:41.606 --> 12:43.639
(laughing)

12:51.406 --> 12:54.173
(honking)

12:54.206 --> 12:55.639
Just come on!

12:55.673 --> 12:57.706
It doesn't go over 60!

12:58.573 --> 12:59.673
Ya piece of...

12:59.706 --> 13:03.306
(hiphop instrumental music)

13:58.173 --> 13:59.539
What's up boo boo?

13:59.573 --> 14:02.706
I hit you up last night, but...

14:02.739 --> 14:04.639
You didn't hit me back.

14:10.406 --> 14:12.473
Nah it's cool, it's cool.

14:12.506 --> 14:15.473
You don't have to explain.

14:15.506 --> 14:18.573
What you been up to
today though, hm?

14:19.439 --> 14:21.506
You do look good though.

14:21.539 --> 14:23.673
(chuckling)

14:27.606 --> 14:28.439
Who, me?

14:29.473 --> 14:31.239
Oh, nah, nah...

14:31.273 --> 14:33.273
I've had these pants for months.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.606
Literally, months.

14:42.206 --> 14:44.206
Why did I just say that?

14:46.573 --> 14:48.673
Well anyway, um...

14:48.706 --> 14:51.573
Yeah boo boo, can
I call you boo boo?

14:53.606 --> 14:54.706
You know...

14:55.706 --> 14:57.439
It was really nice
seeing you today,

14:57.473 --> 15:00.173
I don't think I'm
gonna get this Pepsi,

15:00.206 --> 15:02.639
I'm just not that thirsty.

15:02.673 --> 15:05.806
Oh, but I do just live
down the street, so...

15:05.839 --> 15:09.439
Any time you wanna
swing by, let me know.

15:53.339 --> 15:56.706
You see, there's two types
of people in this world, son.

15:56.739 --> 15:58.606
Those with loaded guns,

15:58.639 --> 16:00.239
and those that dig.

16:00.273 --> 16:01.773
So you start diggin'.

16:03.839 --> 16:08.206
You see, there's two types
of people in this world, son.

16:08.239 --> 16:09.739
Those with loaded guns,

16:09.773 --> 16:12.639
and those that start diggin'.

16:12.673 --> 16:13.773
So you better dig.

16:17.539 --> 16:21.306
You see, there's two types
of people in this world, son.

16:21.339 --> 16:23.173
Those with loaded guns,

16:23.206 --> 16:26.639
and those that dig,
so you start diggin'.

16:32.606 --> 16:34.706
You talkin' to me?

16:34.739 --> 16:37.239
I said, are you talkin' to me?

16:41.139 --> 16:42.606
You talkin' to me?

16:42.639 --> 16:44.706
Are you talkin' to me?

16:44.739 --> 16:46.239
Well I'm the only one here,

16:46.273 --> 16:48.439
so who are you talking to?

16:52.539 --> 16:56.139
You can get much further
with a kind word and a gun,

16:56.173 --> 16:59.106
then you can with
just a kind word.

17:06.906 --> 17:08.606
Sometimes...

17:08.639 --> 17:12.806
You either get busy living,
or you get busy dying.

17:12.839 --> 17:15.273
(gunshots)

17:32.373 --> 17:34.539
(buzzing)

18:22.506 --> 18:24.739
(gargling)

18:39.273 --> 18:42.339
(fake drum crashing)

21:06.673 --> 21:08.073
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

21:15.439 --> 21:19.206
(intense instrumental music)

24:49.413 --> 24:51.879
(gunshots)

24:53.513 --> 24:55.979
(gunshots)

25:22.546 --> 25:26.313
(intense instrumental music)

26:22.146 --> 26:24.113
- This is Agent 753.

26:24.146 --> 26:26.446
I've tracked down the
Amherst cleaner team.

26:26.479 --> 26:29.379
They seem to have stumbled upon
a Red Cross relief station.

26:29.413 --> 26:32.246
There are no other
survivors here.

26:33.979 --> 26:35.213
With these targets down,

26:35.246 --> 26:37.213
I'm gonna make my way
over to Ludlow County.

26:37.246 --> 26:40.079
I heard a few other
agents have...

26:40.113 --> 26:42.846
Encountered some cleaner
teams down there.

26:42.879 --> 26:46.046
- [Man On Radio]
Roger Agent, we copy.

26:52.313 --> 26:54.146
- Central, there's a
broken Amherst robot

26:54.179 --> 26:55.979
in the back of this
cleaning team's vehicle.

26:56.013 --> 26:59.313
Should we bring it back to
operations for examination?

26:59.346 --> 27:00.346
- [Man On Radio] No
need for that, Agent.

27:00.379 --> 27:01.946
Recent intel is showing that the

27:01.979 --> 27:04.846
Amherst personnel are utilizing
their robotics batteries

27:04.879 --> 27:06.413
to power GPS systems.

27:07.646 --> 27:09.213
- Copy that, Central.

27:09.246 --> 27:10.446
I'll be taking the vehicle back

27:10.479 --> 27:12.913
to make good use
of time and fuel.

27:12.946 --> 27:14.513
- [Man On Radio]
Copy that, Agent.

27:14.546 --> 27:15.546
- Agent out.

27:37.379 --> 27:40.446
All right buddy,
you're staying here.

28:20.313 --> 28:22.346
- [Survivor] What the fuck.

28:39.979 --> 28:43.079
- [Robot] My model
number is BRO3886.

28:45.379 --> 28:49.413
I am a systematic algorithm
maintenance robot.

28:49.446 --> 28:52.246
How may I be of service to you?

28:53.479 --> 28:57.279
- You won't be of any
service to me, buddy.

29:10.646 --> 29:15.013
- [Robot] Your physical
action is an unnecessary one.

29:17.513 --> 29:19.379
- Relax battery brain.

29:19.413 --> 29:22.313
I'm just asking if you'd rather
spend your night out here,

29:22.346 --> 29:26.379
or in one of those random
buildings out there.

29:28.079 --> 29:31.079
- [Robot] Do you happen to
have any electronic devices

29:31.113 --> 29:32.346
that you utilize?

29:34.379 --> 29:36.046
- Nice try, asshole.

29:37.213 --> 29:38.913
Yeah, I have electronics.

29:38.946 --> 29:40.313
But I'm not gonna
be sitting around

29:40.346 --> 29:43.379
listening to you yap
every five seconds.

29:43.413 --> 29:45.413
The last robot
that was in there,

29:45.446 --> 29:48.446
he wouldn't shut up for the
first four months I was here.

29:48.479 --> 29:51.279
Luckily, he was just
a systematic droid

29:51.313 --> 29:55.013
and he had to be charged
every six months.

29:56.613 --> 30:00.379
- [Robot] My body is not at
full operational capability,

30:00.413 --> 30:04.113
but I was designed with an
amalgamation cord powered cell

30:04.146 --> 30:07.513
exclusive to most Amherst
Industries robotics.

30:07.546 --> 30:10.379
With a fusion decay of 22 parts

30:10.413 --> 30:12.479
per trillion per second squared,

30:12.513 --> 30:16.879
my lifespan will most likely
exceed that of 3,400 years.

30:18.246 --> 30:20.579
Any electronic devices
you currently own

30:20.613 --> 30:24.979
can be powered by me for
long after you have perished.

30:28.213 --> 30:30.913
- Well bub, I'm definitely
not gonna be sitting around

30:30.946 --> 30:32.346
listening to you yap.

30:32.379 --> 30:34.413
So you have a choice, all right?

30:34.446 --> 30:37.146
Either out here, or in there.

30:37.179 --> 30:38.546
What's it gonna be?

30:52.046 --> 30:54.279
Guess you made your choice.

34:03.758 --> 34:05.892
Come here ya little bastard.

34:27.725 --> 34:31.725
How do I plug this into
you to charge my laptop?

34:32.925 --> 34:34.525
- [Robot] You must find the port

34:34.558 --> 34:36.592
on my back power panel.

34:36.625 --> 34:37.958
Once you plug in the cord,

34:37.992 --> 34:40.825
you must have the
female USB plugged into

34:40.858 --> 34:43.425
the male end on the power cord.

34:51.692 --> 34:53.858
- [Survivor] Stupid robot.

35:43.925 --> 35:44.825
- [Reporter] Though the evidence

35:44.858 --> 35:46.758
itself has not been revealed,

35:46.792 --> 35:49.758
US intelligence is
claiming to have...

35:55.625 --> 35:56.425
- [Video Game Character]
Fisher, we're getting

35:56.458 --> 35:57.658
close to war.

35:57.692 --> 35:59.658
If Nikoladze kills these
men on live broadcast,

35:59.692 --> 36:01.292
we're sunk.

36:01.325 --> 36:02.292
- [Fisher] Are we worrying
about the broadcast

36:02.325 --> 36:03.558
or the murders?

36:03.592 --> 36:04.758
- [Video Game Character]
For now, the broadcast.

36:04.792 --> 36:06.625
It'll buy us time to
stop the killings.

36:06.658 --> 36:09.558
Nikoladze is broadcasting
from an antenna on the roof.

36:09.592 --> 36:10.792
That's your first objective.

36:10.825 --> 36:13.758
You'll find the
rest on your OPSAT.

36:20.458 --> 36:21.892
- [Robot] Are you
the only survivor

36:21.925 --> 36:24.625
currently living in this town?

36:29.958 --> 36:32.292
- If there was any
other survivors,

36:32.325 --> 36:35.425
I highly doubt I'd
be talking to you.

36:36.392 --> 36:37.692
- [Robot] I observed the remains

36:37.725 --> 36:39.992
of a Red Cross relief station.

36:40.025 --> 36:42.758
What happened to all
of the survivors?

36:42.792 --> 36:46.792
Was the Red Cross unable
to contain an outbreak?

36:48.592 --> 36:50.692
- My dad ran that
Red Cross station,

36:50.725 --> 36:52.658
and he did a damn good job.

36:52.692 --> 36:55.225
There was no outbreak.

36:55.258 --> 36:59.692
If anything, it was the
safest place you could be.

36:59.725 --> 37:03.258
- [Robot] Did they
abandon you here?

37:03.292 --> 37:04.525
- No, dude.

37:04.558 --> 37:06.692
I wasn't left here
intentionally.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.592
There were many survivors,

37:08.625 --> 37:10.625
mostly women and children.

37:10.658 --> 37:11.925
But my dad thought
it was a good idea

37:11.958 --> 37:14.792
to take them all
to the Safe Zone.

37:16.825 --> 37:19.492
My dad thought that
it was a good idea

37:19.525 --> 37:22.325
to load them all
in a transport bus

37:22.358 --> 37:24.692
and take as many as he could,

37:24.725 --> 37:27.325
and when they left
I never saw him

37:27.358 --> 37:28.892
or my step-mom again.

37:45.992 --> 37:49.592
- [Robot] Why did you
not go looking for them?

37:49.625 --> 37:53.792
- You don't know how to mind
your own business, do you?

37:57.525 --> 37:59.658
- [Robot] I am just
trying to understand

37:59.692 --> 38:01.025
my new environment.

38:04.892 --> 38:07.458
- After about a week and a half,

38:07.492 --> 38:09.325
all the younger men
decided to head out

38:09.358 --> 38:11.858
on foot towards the Safe Zone.

38:30.592 --> 38:34.758
- [Robot] Have you tried
connecting to the internet?

38:36.692 --> 38:37.492
- How?

38:37.525 --> 38:40.725
This laptop died
seven months ago.

38:40.758 --> 38:42.492
And besides...

38:42.525 --> 38:46.425
It's impossible to connect
without a satellite.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.858
- [Robot] I am able to
connect to the internet

38:49.892 --> 38:52.758
in almost every
region of the world.

38:52.792 --> 38:55.858
Why don't you check
the internet now?

39:34.592 --> 39:36.958
It appears as though
the closest Safe Zone

39:36.992 --> 39:39.692
to our location is Safe Zone 57.

39:43.692 --> 39:46.558
Statistically, Safe Zone 57

39:46.592 --> 39:50.492
most likely is home to
your friends and family.

39:51.492 --> 39:53.725
- Statistically...

39:53.758 --> 39:55.792
What are you talking about?

39:57.258 --> 39:59.725
- [Robot] In a vehicle
it would not have taken

39:59.758 --> 40:02.258
long for them to
travel there safely.

40:02.292 --> 40:05.758
Also, if the Safe Zone
was not currently active,

40:05.792 --> 40:07.758
the government
would be showing you

40:07.792 --> 40:09.925
a different route to safety.

40:11.292 --> 40:13.725
The positives could
outweigh the negatives

40:13.758 --> 40:16.325
for making a trip there on foot.

40:16.358 --> 40:18.825
The trip could reunite
you with your family.

40:18.858 --> 40:20.658
- How do you even know
that they're there?

40:20.692 --> 40:22.658
I mean, just cause it's not far

40:22.692 --> 40:26.358
doesn't mean that they
made it out alive.

40:26.392 --> 40:29.225
- [Robot] Statistically,
my algorithms show

40:29.258 --> 40:30.825
out of all the possible endings

40:30.858 --> 40:32.892
for your friends and family,

40:32.925 --> 40:36.692
my software indicates
an 88.7 percent chance

40:36.725 --> 40:39.892
they currently reside
at Safe Zone 57.

40:45.792 --> 40:49.725
- Well I'm not gonna trust
a statistical observation

40:49.758 --> 40:51.692
from a broken ass robot.

40:51.725 --> 40:52.758
Don't you work for the company

40:52.792 --> 40:56.258
that started the
outbreak anyway?

40:56.292 --> 40:59.825
- [Robot] I am a systematic
algorithm maintenance robot.

40:59.858 --> 41:02.425
I was used for maintenance
on the computers

41:02.458 --> 41:06.625
and appliances used in one of
Amherst Industries warehouses.

41:07.792 --> 41:10.992
My connection to Amherst
was maintenance based,

41:11.025 --> 41:13.858
I had no connection to
the company's economic

41:13.892 --> 41:15.758
or social interests.

41:28.425 --> 41:30.992
- Why would I want
to leave here anyway?

41:31.025 --> 41:31.925
I mean...

41:31.958 --> 41:33.825
I've got everything here.

41:33.858 --> 41:36.858
Food, water, shelter,
entertainment.

41:39.792 --> 41:41.492
And best of all...

41:42.558 --> 41:44.558
I know how to hide here.

41:54.458 --> 41:56.792
- [Robot] From witnessing
your protective behavior

41:56.825 --> 41:58.992
over your supplies
earlier today,

41:59.025 --> 42:01.758
my statistics indicate
that your ration supply

42:01.792 --> 42:03.658
may be running low.

42:03.692 --> 42:05.458
Without food and water,

42:05.492 --> 42:08.758
you will have to resort
to hunting and gathering.

42:08.792 --> 42:12.258
Traveling to the Safe Zone
outweighs the consequences

42:12.292 --> 42:15.525
of waiting for your
rations to run out.

42:16.692 --> 42:18.758
- You have no idea how
much food and water I have,

42:18.792 --> 42:21.325
so you can go fuck yourself!

42:23.692 --> 42:25.892
- [Robot] I am
unable to procreate,

42:25.925 --> 42:29.758
therefore masturbation
is useless for a robot.

42:31.725 --> 42:33.858
The calendar drawn on
your wall indicates

42:33.892 --> 42:37.692
that you are keeping
track of your rations.

42:42.892 --> 42:44.825
- I'm actually a very organized

42:44.858 --> 42:46.558
and methodical person,

42:46.592 --> 42:49.358
and that's why
I'm keeping track.

42:55.425 --> 42:57.758
- [Robot] The unkempt nature
of your living quarters

42:57.792 --> 43:00.792
shows your lack of
organization skills.

43:02.525 --> 43:04.725
- Just shut the fuck up already.

43:04.758 --> 43:07.758
I knew I didn't want
to bring you in here.

43:07.792 --> 43:10.525
God, you're just
gonna bother me.

43:18.858 --> 43:20.958
- [Robot] You would only
have to deal with me

43:20.992 --> 43:24.692
for seven days if you
decided to travel on foot

43:24.725 --> 43:27.096
to Safe Zone 57.

43:29.530 --> 43:31.263
- I highly doubt that you and I

43:31.296 --> 43:34.130
will be spending much
more time together.

43:34.163 --> 43:35.596
First thing tomorrow morning,

43:35.630 --> 43:38.630
I'm taking your ass
back down out there.

43:38.663 --> 43:40.096
So you know what?

43:40.130 --> 43:41.763
Shut the hell down
or whatever you do,

43:41.796 --> 43:44.396
I'm going to bed, good night.

44:37.430 --> 44:38.263
Hey.

44:59.496 --> 45:00.630
Dang girl.

45:00.663 --> 45:03.363
We keep meeting up like this,

45:03.396 --> 45:05.696
that's gotta be a sign, right?

45:08.563 --> 45:10.596
Well, anyway...

45:10.630 --> 45:12.663
I would invite you
over some time soon,

45:12.696 --> 45:16.696
but I just got this
annoying new roommate and...

45:18.630 --> 45:20.530
He just talks and
talks and talks.

45:20.563 --> 45:24.030
I can't even enjoy
playing video games.

45:27.263 --> 45:31.096
Nah, but I'm evicting
his ass today, so...

45:31.130 --> 45:33.696
Maybe we can try something
on later this week?

45:33.730 --> 45:34.563
Like um...

45:35.596 --> 45:37.430
Friday night possibly?

45:53.563 --> 45:56.763
(desolate ambient music)

47:25.663 --> 47:29.596
I am going to find you
dad, wherever you are.

48:44.696 --> 48:46.096
- [Robot] Does your
packing indicate

48:46.130 --> 48:49.530
that we will be traveling
to the Safe Zone?

48:52.663 --> 48:53.563
- No.

48:53.596 --> 48:55.496
I just packed a whole
week's worth of food

48:55.530 --> 48:58.463
for absolutely no
fucking reason.

49:25.596 --> 49:26.496
We're gonna have to figure out

49:26.530 --> 49:27.696
something to call you man.

49:27.730 --> 49:29.530
I'm not gonna remember
your model number,

49:29.563 --> 49:31.063
it's way too long.

49:33.463 --> 49:34.430
- [Robot] You can refer to me

49:34.463 --> 49:38.330
as a systematic algorithm
maintenance robot.

49:42.563 --> 49:44.063
- That's not a name, dude.

49:44.096 --> 49:45.663
That's a job title.

49:53.496 --> 49:54.563
Well...

49:54.596 --> 49:56.063
I'm tempted to bring this laptop

49:56.096 --> 50:00.096
cause I know I can play
Splinter Cell now, so...

50:16.263 --> 50:17.763
- [Robot] I am most
certain that you are

50:17.796 --> 50:20.596
making the miscalculation
on the proper weight

50:20.630 --> 50:23.563
a man your size
should be carrying.

50:24.763 --> 50:27.663
- What the fuck are
you trying to say, huh?

50:27.696 --> 50:29.630
I can carry this shit.

50:29.663 --> 50:31.730
And besides, Splinter Cell
is like the last thing

50:31.763 --> 50:33.430
that I have to
hold on to the life

50:33.463 --> 50:36.296
that was before this shit.

50:36.330 --> 50:37.563
- [Robot] I am
merely pointing out

50:37.596 --> 50:39.363
that the weight you are packing

50:39.396 --> 50:43.563
will slow down your speed
of travel significantly.

50:45.696 --> 50:46.596
- Don't care bro.

50:46.630 --> 50:49.063
Sam Fisher, can't pass that up.

50:49.096 --> 50:50.330
Not leavin' it.

51:00.730 --> 51:03.363
Sam Fisher is so cool.

51:03.396 --> 51:05.530
Sam Fisher, stealth as fuck.

51:10.430 --> 51:13.530
Hey man, what was
your job title again?

51:13.563 --> 51:17.563
- I am a systematic
algorithm maintenance robot.

51:18.863 --> 51:20.130
- Holy shit!

51:20.163 --> 51:22.096
S-A-M.

51:22.130 --> 51:26.196
Systematic algorithmic
maintenance robot.

51:26.230 --> 51:29.363
SAM, like the homie Sam Fisher.

51:29.396 --> 51:32.530
That's what I'm
gonna call you, man.

51:32.563 --> 51:36.696
- [SAM] I do believe SAM
is a fitting acronym.

51:36.730 --> 51:38.230
- Then it's settled.

51:38.263 --> 51:40.663
SAM, that's your new name.

51:40.696 --> 51:42.330
Oh, and by the way...

51:42.363 --> 51:44.563
I'm gonna be carrying
all of this shit,

51:44.596 --> 51:46.463
so I don't wanna be hearing you

51:46.496 --> 51:48.496
call me a bitch anymore.

51:50.463 --> 51:52.263
- [SAM] I was not insulting you,

51:52.296 --> 51:54.663
only laying out the
mathematical statistics

51:54.696 --> 51:56.630
for your rate of speed.

51:59.863 --> 52:02.430
- Just shut the fuck up, SAM.

52:18.630 --> 52:20.463
- [SAM] Are you sure
you don't want to

52:20.496 --> 52:23.396
reconsider the
weight in your load?

52:33.596 --> 52:34.563
- What?

52:34.596 --> 52:36.096
Nah.

52:36.130 --> 52:38.230
This pack is super light.

52:51.863 --> 52:53.563
Lighten my load...

52:56.530 --> 52:57.630
What a guy.

53:30.181 --> 53:34.181
How far do you think we'll
make it by nightfall?

53:35.281 --> 53:37.048
- [SAM] At your
current rate of speed,

53:37.081 --> 53:40.048
we may make it at
least 15 miles.

53:43.148 --> 53:45.048
- At my current rate of speed?

53:45.081 --> 53:46.914
No, no, no, no.

53:46.948 --> 53:49.248
I was just making a stop
at this building here.

53:49.281 --> 53:50.281
We'll get going much faster

53:50.314 --> 53:52.081
when we leave here, all right?

53:52.114 --> 53:53.048
No worries.

53:54.681 --> 53:56.948
- [SAM] I will keep my
current estimated distance

53:56.981 --> 53:59.014
of travel for today.

53:59.048 --> 54:02.248
If you begin to exceed my
average statistical speed,

54:02.281 --> 54:04.881
I will alert you immediately.

54:05.781 --> 54:08.181
- Just shut the fuck up, SAM.

54:13.014 --> 54:14.181
I'm still a little winded

54:14.214 --> 54:17.148
from this new workout
I've been trying.

54:21.148 --> 54:23.948
Anyway, so look boo boo.

54:23.981 --> 54:25.248
It's not working out, you know?

54:25.281 --> 54:29.114
Yeah, I invited you
over and you never came

54:29.148 --> 54:30.914
despite all of
those obvious hints

54:30.948 --> 54:33.648
that I dropped to you, so...

54:33.681 --> 54:36.848
I just don't think
this is gonna work.

54:37.881 --> 54:39.614
Oh, I mean it is what it is.

54:39.648 --> 54:43.981
I just, I can't be the man
that you want me to be, so...

54:44.014 --> 54:46.348
And besides, I'm
actually leaving town.

54:46.381 --> 54:48.581
So, best of luck to you.

54:49.281 --> 54:50.114
Stay sexy.

55:03.714 --> 55:04.881
You know what?

55:06.048 --> 55:08.648
I am gonna drink
this Pepsi today.

55:10.214 --> 55:11.681
I don't have any money,

55:11.714 --> 55:14.148
so I'm not gonna
fucking pay for it.

55:14.181 --> 55:15.014
Peace.

55:18.248 --> 55:21.148
Man, I don't even
understand women.

55:24.081 --> 55:25.148
Oh, what the...

55:32.114 --> 55:34.181
(coughing)

55:37.081 --> 55:38.714
Oh my God.

55:38.748 --> 55:41.148
No wonder it fucking sprayed.

55:44.748 --> 55:47.081
Never drink a bottle of soda

55:47.114 --> 55:50.114
that's been sitting
for over a year.

55:55.114 --> 55:56.348
- [SAM] I am not too sure

55:56.381 --> 55:58.348
what you are talking about.

55:58.381 --> 56:00.314
Are you feeling unwell?

56:04.314 --> 56:05.948
- I'm fine, SAM.

56:05.981 --> 56:09.814
You know what, just forget
I said anything, okay?

56:21.148 --> 56:22.148
Well...

56:22.181 --> 56:23.748
Let's see if I can beat that

56:23.781 --> 56:27.214
statistical speed of
yours, little buddy.

56:32.214 --> 56:35.981
(calming instrumental music)

1:00:59.181 --> 1:01:00.248
Which way, SAM?

1:01:01.681 --> 1:01:03.181
- [SAM] Move left.

1:01:04.181 --> 1:01:05.581
Please move left.

1:01:06.914 --> 1:01:08.081
Continue left.

1:01:09.281 --> 1:01:10.981
More to your left.

1:01:13.181 --> 1:01:15.714
You are too far off course.

1:01:15.748 --> 1:01:19.114
Please take a step
clockwise to your right.

1:01:21.048 --> 1:01:23.048
You are now on course.

1:01:23.081 --> 1:01:25.814
Please travel in this direction.

1:01:25.848 --> 1:01:27.314
- Very helpful, SAM.

1:02:42.995 --> 1:02:47.095
- [SAM] Your current water
intake is unnecessary.

1:02:50.862 --> 1:02:52.362
- Here we go again.

1:02:52.395 --> 1:02:54.229
Always bitchin' at me.

1:04:03.929 --> 1:04:05.329
- [SAM] You should
consider eating

1:04:05.362 --> 1:04:08.129
smaller portions
of your rations.

1:04:10.262 --> 1:04:12.129
- Fuck you, SAM.

1:04:12.162 --> 1:04:13.795
We've been traveling all day.

1:04:13.829 --> 1:04:16.295
I eat when I want to, all right?

1:04:47.962 --> 1:04:49.929
- [SAM] Statistically
your water and rations

1:04:49.962 --> 1:04:53.795
will run out before we
arrive at Safe Zone 57.

1:04:56.095 --> 1:04:57.395
- You told me that we
were gonna be traveling

1:04:57.429 --> 1:04:58.929
for a few days.

1:04:58.962 --> 1:05:00.995
It's been like a week, man.

1:05:01.029 --> 1:05:03.995
Of course I'm gonna
run out of food.

1:05:06.262 --> 1:05:08.962
(bird cawing)

1:06:54.329 --> 1:06:55.362
Okay...

1:06:56.962 --> 1:06:58.895
Please, please, please.

1:07:04.295 --> 1:07:05.295
God damn it.

1:07:06.229 --> 1:07:09.195
Why did I have to eat
all my fuckin' food?

1:07:09.229 --> 1:07:13.129
- [SAM] You should have
listened to my warning.

1:07:19.562 --> 1:07:20.395
- Oh shit.

1:07:25.129 --> 1:07:27.995
No food or water, but
some alcohol will do.

1:07:28.029 --> 1:07:30.295
(laughing)

1:07:38.295 --> 1:07:39.129
Ah.

1:07:41.195 --> 1:07:42.262
Now that...

1:07:42.295 --> 1:07:43.795
Is some good shit.

1:07:47.495 --> 1:07:49.229
- [SAM] I would
like to point out

1:07:49.262 --> 1:07:51.795
that beer will flush
water out of your system

1:07:51.829 --> 1:07:53.995
and dehydrate you further.

1:07:56.462 --> 1:07:59.529
- SAM, don't ruin
the fucking moment.

1:07:59.562 --> 1:08:00.395
All right?

1:08:23.262 --> 1:08:27.429
- [SAM] How many of those
do you plan on drinking?

1:08:31.062 --> 1:08:32.262
- I don't know mom,

1:08:32.295 --> 1:08:35.229
what are you gonna
call the cops?

1:08:36.995 --> 1:08:40.329
- [SAM] Your safety depends
on your ability to travel.

1:08:40.362 --> 1:08:43.095
If you suffer from dehydration,

1:08:43.129 --> 1:08:46.129
you'll be in a great
deal of danger.

1:08:48.562 --> 1:08:51.162
- Can you not give me
your opinion right now?

1:08:51.195 --> 1:08:53.329
I don't need any statistics.

1:08:56.129 --> 1:08:59.229
But I do have one question man.

1:08:59.262 --> 1:09:00.862
Do you have any songs on that

1:09:00.895 --> 1:09:04.295
annoying ass fucking
hard drive of yours?

1:09:06.195 --> 1:09:07.495
- [SAM] I only have one song

1:09:07.529 --> 1:09:09.829
saved onto my memory.

1:09:09.862 --> 1:09:12.762
It was my creator's
favorite tune.

1:09:12.795 --> 1:09:14.095
- Oh shit!

1:09:14.129 --> 1:09:15.329
(laughing)

1:09:15.362 --> 1:09:17.295
I don't care what it
is, let's hear it!

Yeah.

God.

1:12:07.995 --> 1:12:09.829
I'm so fuckin' hungry.

1:12:27.633 --> 1:12:28.466
Ah...

1:13:43.408 --> 1:13:44.241
Hey SAM...

1:13:45.441 --> 1:13:47.208
Do you truly believe
that when we make it

1:13:47.241 --> 1:13:50.441
to the Safe Zone my
family will be there?

1:14:02.074 --> 1:14:04.508
- [SAM] There's an
88.7 percent chance

1:14:04.541 --> 1:14:05.941
your family--

1:14:05.974 --> 1:14:07.108
- Currently resides
in the Safe Zone,

1:14:07.141 --> 1:14:08.208
yeah, I get it.

1:14:09.308 --> 1:14:13.008
But do you think they'll
actually be there?

1:14:14.874 --> 1:14:17.041
- [SAM] One must
arrive at the Safe Zone

1:14:17.074 --> 1:14:21.074
in order to truly discover
if they are there.

1:14:21.108 --> 1:14:23.108
- Well no shit, asshole.

1:14:28.041 --> 1:14:32.208
There you go, being all
smart and statistical again.

1:14:33.474 --> 1:14:36.241
Always doing that shit.

1:14:36.274 --> 1:14:40.174
- [SAM] Precisely, I was
only delivering facts.

1:14:41.141 --> 1:14:42.274
- Facts?

1:14:42.308 --> 1:14:43.208
Facts?

1:14:43.241 --> 1:14:44.341
You want to talk about facts?

1:14:44.374 --> 1:14:47.141
Well the fact is, we wouldn't
even be in this situation

1:14:47.174 --> 1:14:48.841
if Amherst didn't
spread the virus

1:14:48.874 --> 1:14:51.208
that killed all of humanity.

1:14:54.274 --> 1:14:57.341
- [SAM] Only 98 of the
population perished

1:14:57.374 --> 1:14:58.808
due to the virus.

1:15:01.108 --> 1:15:02.174
- Only?

1:15:02.208 --> 1:15:03.141
Only?

1:15:03.174 --> 1:15:04.041
98 fucking percent?

1:15:04.074 --> 1:15:07.474
That's everyone, you
fucking douchebag.

1:15:09.008 --> 1:15:10.874
- [SAM] Amherst records
indicate they were

1:15:10.908 --> 1:15:13.374
attempting to purge
the American population

1:15:13.408 --> 1:15:16.008
to below zero
point seven percent

1:15:16.041 --> 1:15:17.274
to 319 million.

1:15:21.208 --> 1:15:22.374
- 0.7 percent?

1:15:23.941 --> 1:15:27.174
What the fuck is
that, like 200 people?

1:15:28.474 --> 1:15:30.241
- [SAM] They wanted
approximately

1:15:30.274 --> 1:15:32.841
two million selected survivors.

1:15:34.241 --> 1:15:36.208
- Oh, heh, great yeah.

1:15:36.241 --> 1:15:38.241
Approximately two
million people.

1:15:38.274 --> 1:15:40.041
Yeah, that's awesome.

1:15:40.074 --> 1:15:43.508
And how the fuck
would you know that?

1:15:43.541 --> 1:15:47.041
- [SAM] I was connected to
their statistical servers

1:15:47.074 --> 1:15:51.241
allowing me to access vast
amounts of Amherst records.

1:15:53.441 --> 1:15:54.941
- Unbelievable.

1:15:54.974 --> 1:15:57.174
Unfuckingbelievable.

1:15:57.208 --> 1:15:58.208
You know what?

1:15:58.241 --> 1:15:59.141
Good for you SAM.

1:15:59.174 --> 1:16:01.241
I'm glad that you feel
okay with the fact

1:16:01.274 --> 1:16:04.008
that so many people,
millions of people

1:16:04.041 --> 1:16:07.308
lost their lives for
no fucking reason.

1:16:09.208 --> 1:16:12.241
A family once lived
happily in this country.

1:16:12.274 --> 1:16:14.974
They had dreams, lives, jobs.

1:16:15.008 --> 1:16:16.508
They loved one another,

1:16:16.541 --> 1:16:19.208
and Amherst took
all of that away.

1:16:19.241 --> 1:16:21.508
No American, no
person in general

1:16:21.541 --> 1:16:24.774
should be able to decide
who lives and who dies.

1:16:24.808 --> 1:16:25.941
It's ridiculous.

1:16:30.008 --> 1:16:31.441
- [SAM] Dr. Amherst had believed

1:16:31.474 --> 1:16:34.874
he was doing this
country a great service.

1:16:34.908 --> 1:16:37.108
With the rapid
growth of population

1:16:37.141 --> 1:16:39.341
and the lack of
natural resources,

1:16:39.374 --> 1:16:41.341
this country would
have been destroyed

1:16:41.374 --> 1:16:44.808
by something much
worse than the virus.

1:16:47.008 --> 1:16:48.308
- So?

1:16:48.341 --> 1:16:50.074
I mean, who could've
even predicted

1:16:50.108 --> 1:16:53.841
what was gonna happen
to this country?

1:16:53.874 --> 1:16:56.141
- [SAM] In
environmental biology,

1:16:56.174 --> 1:16:57.741
there is a much debated topic

1:16:57.774 --> 1:17:01.441
revolving around the
population's carrying capacity.

1:17:01.474 --> 1:17:03.874
At the rate America was growing,

1:17:03.908 --> 1:17:06.074
our environment would
have not been able

1:17:06.108 --> 1:17:09.941
to sustain the proper
living for its citizens.

1:17:12.274 --> 1:17:15.941
- What do you know about the
proper living for humans?

1:17:15.974 --> 1:17:17.041
Robotic fuck.

1:17:24.308 --> 1:17:26.341
- [SAM] These are
not my opinions.

1:17:26.374 --> 1:17:30.308
These are the reasons
behind the Amherst virus.

1:17:32.774 --> 1:17:36.941
- Jesus, you make it sound
like Amherst was right.

1:17:38.308 --> 1:17:41.208
- [SAM] I am unable to
create opinions or feelings.

1:17:41.241 --> 1:17:45.241
Your frustration was sparked
by the moral question of

1:17:45.274 --> 1:17:48.208
why did Amherst
spread the virus?

1:17:48.241 --> 1:17:51.174
I simply provide the
facts and beliefs

1:17:51.208 --> 1:17:53.008
of Amherst Industries.

1:17:53.041 --> 1:17:55.874
I was merely attempting
to further your knowledge

1:17:55.908 --> 1:17:58.274
and help ease your frustration.

1:18:01.241 --> 1:18:03.841
- Well I don't need your
God damn help, okay?

1:18:03.874 --> 1:18:06.341
Nothing is going to
ease my frustration.

1:18:06.374 --> 1:18:09.741
I had a family, and Amherst
took all of that away,

1:18:09.774 --> 1:18:13.941
and nothing is ever going
to help me get over that.

1:18:24.041 --> 1:18:25.041
God damn it!

1:19:04.141 --> 1:19:06.308
Look SAM, I'm sorry, okay?

1:19:07.974 --> 1:19:09.208
I know that you're
not the reason

1:19:09.241 --> 1:19:12.208
that Amherst spread
the virus, I just...

1:19:14.274 --> 1:19:16.908
I don't want to
be alone anymore,

1:19:16.941 --> 1:19:18.274
and I miss my family,

1:19:18.308 --> 1:19:21.274
I miss the way that
things used to be.

1:19:25.774 --> 1:19:27.374
- [SAM] I want
you to be reunited

1:19:27.408 --> 1:19:30.041
with your friends and family.

1:19:34.008 --> 1:19:36.341
- Well I appreciate your help.

1:19:36.374 --> 1:19:38.241
If it's all right with you,

1:19:38.274 --> 1:19:40.708
I'd like to keep going now.

1:19:45.374 --> 1:19:46.374
Soon enough.

1:22:09.014 --> 1:22:12.748
- [SAM] Dylan, what is
your current location?

1:22:15.881 --> 1:22:19.514
Alarm, alarm, alarm,
alarm, alarm, alarm.

1:22:21.548 --> 1:22:23.781
(loud alarm)

1:22:37.581 --> 1:22:40.381
- Where you going
with that shit?

1:22:40.414 --> 1:22:42.314
You won't get too far..

1:22:47.748 --> 1:22:49.848
All right, relax.

1:22:49.881 --> 1:22:51.714
You could take it.

1:22:51.748 --> 1:22:53.748
- Shut the fuck up, SAM.

1:23:13.848 --> 1:23:16.748
I don't want all of your food.

1:23:16.781 --> 1:23:18.914
I just wanted something to eat.

1:23:18.948 --> 1:23:20.814
- Take more if you want.

1:23:20.848 --> 1:23:22.814
Take as much as you need.

1:23:22.848 --> 1:23:23.981
I don't need it.

1:23:26.514 --> 1:23:27.948
- Don't fuckin' follow me,

1:23:27.981 --> 1:23:30.748
I'll put a bullet in your head.

1:23:46.414 --> 1:23:48.848
- I don't need to follow you.

1:24:48.348 --> 1:24:49.814
- [SAM] Why did you not tell me

1:24:49.848 --> 1:24:53.514
about your plan to steal
food from that man?

1:24:56.348 --> 1:24:57.548
- Because...

1:24:57.581 --> 1:25:00.381
I didn't want to
hear your opinion.

1:25:02.314 --> 1:25:06.314
- [SAM] I have never
given you an opinion.

1:25:06.348 --> 1:25:07.481
- Yes you do.

1:25:07.514 --> 1:25:11.548
You give me your opinion
all the damn time.

1:25:11.581 --> 1:25:14.314
- [SAM] I give you
statistical possibilities,

1:25:14.348 --> 1:25:16.848
and the most probable outcome.

1:25:18.014 --> 1:25:18.914
- Well then what were the odds

1:25:18.948 --> 1:25:21.414
of that man killing me, huh?

1:25:22.748 --> 1:25:24.514
- There was a 50/50 chance

1:25:24.548 --> 1:25:26.881
he had more than one weapon.

1:25:28.781 --> 1:25:29.814
- Yeah, well...

1:25:31.381 --> 1:25:32.781
I didn't really
need to hear that

1:25:32.814 --> 1:25:35.748
before I put my
life on the line.

1:25:38.414 --> 1:25:40.714
- [SAM] Computers and
robotics were invented

1:25:40.748 --> 1:25:42.681
to help humans survive.

1:25:46.848 --> 1:25:48.714
- I was hungry and dehydrated.

1:25:48.748 --> 1:25:50.281
I had no choice.

1:25:53.814 --> 1:25:55.714
- [SAM] The
definition of survival

1:25:55.748 --> 1:25:58.614
is continuing to live or exist,

1:25:58.648 --> 1:26:01.881
especially in spite
of danger or hardship.

1:26:09.981 --> 1:26:11.681
- You know, SAM...

1:26:13.881 --> 1:26:15.814
I know you're just a computer,

1:26:15.848 --> 1:26:18.581
but sometimes it's hard
for me to accept the fact

1:26:18.614 --> 1:26:20.814
that you worked
for Amherst, okay?

1:26:20.848 --> 1:26:22.481
Like you don't seem to even care

1:26:22.514 --> 1:26:25.781
about all the people that
died from that virus.

1:26:27.581 --> 1:26:30.781
- [SAM] I am sorry that my
affiliation with Amherst

1:26:30.814 --> 1:26:33.014
makes you feel uncomfortable.

1:26:35.848 --> 1:26:37.648
- I mean, do you even feel bad

1:26:37.681 --> 1:26:41.348
that your company killed
millions of people?

1:26:43.914 --> 1:26:45.814
- [SAM] I am unable
to add feelings

1:26:45.848 --> 1:26:47.914
toward any given subject.

1:26:47.948 --> 1:26:50.848
I am programmed to
sympathize with humans

1:26:50.881 --> 1:26:53.681
who are in distress or turmoil.

1:26:55.948 --> 1:26:57.481
- So you're programmed
to just give me

1:26:57.514 --> 1:27:00.614
a generic apology
whenever I'm upset?

1:27:03.914 --> 1:27:05.881
- [SAM] Humans seem
to prefer hearing

1:27:05.914 --> 1:27:08.981
a sympathetic response
as opposed to facts,

1:27:09.014 --> 1:27:11.381
or in many cases, silence.

1:27:13.514 --> 1:27:16.914
- Why the hell
would you be silent?

1:27:16.948 --> 1:27:18.948
- [SAM] Because I
am unable to process

1:27:18.981 --> 1:27:22.514
your irritation with
Amherst Industries.

1:27:23.748 --> 1:27:25.848
- Well SAM, it only has to do

1:27:25.881 --> 1:27:28.748
with this little
thing called morals.

1:27:30.014 --> 1:27:31.848
- [SAM] I understand
you do not like

1:27:31.881 --> 1:27:34.348
that the safety of
your fellow humans

1:27:34.381 --> 1:27:35.848
was put at risk.

1:27:35.881 --> 1:27:38.714
I am in fact a victim
of that human reaction

1:27:38.748 --> 1:27:40.681
to the Amherst virus.

1:27:42.814 --> 1:27:44.014
- Oh yeah?

1:27:44.048 --> 1:27:46.781
And how exactly
are you a victim?

1:27:48.081 --> 1:27:50.614
- [SAM] The large
distribution warehouse

1:27:50.648 --> 1:27:52.714
that I was built to maintain

1:27:52.748 --> 1:27:54.714
came under attack
once it was known

1:27:54.748 --> 1:27:58.814
that Amherst Industries
laboratory spread the virus.

1:27:58.848 --> 1:28:00.848
Humans rioted the building,

1:28:00.881 --> 1:28:02.614
I and several other robots

1:28:02.648 --> 1:28:05.348
were ripped apart,
beaten, destroyed,

1:28:05.381 --> 1:28:06.714
and set on fire.

1:28:18.748 --> 1:28:20.781
I was found several months later

1:28:20.814 --> 1:28:23.048
by an Amherst cleaner team.

1:28:23.081 --> 1:28:27.448
They decided to use my
power cord for electronics.

1:28:29.781 --> 1:28:33.581
- Well why wouldn't
they repair you?

1:28:33.614 --> 1:28:34.914
- [SAM] There are
no more resources

1:28:34.948 --> 1:28:37.648
for advanced
robotics maintenance.

1:28:37.681 --> 1:28:40.648
Dr. Amherst is no longer alive.

1:28:40.681 --> 1:28:43.348
Nobody currently alive
can repair robots

1:28:43.381 --> 1:28:45.881
in my class of sophistication.

1:28:50.714 --> 1:28:53.881
- I'm sorry that
happened to you, SAM.

1:28:55.848 --> 1:28:59.748
- [SAM] you should not
apologize to a computer.

1:29:03.748 --> 1:29:05.048
- Well, whatever.

1:29:05.081 --> 1:29:07.414
I'm gonna go take a piss.

1:29:07.448 --> 1:29:08.881
You might wanna get comfortable,

1:29:08.914 --> 1:29:12.381
cause we're staying
here for the night.

1:29:37.814 --> 1:29:41.381
(mysterious ambient music)

1:30:44.454 --> 1:30:47.987
- [SAM] We have reached
our destination.

1:30:57.854 --> 1:30:58.854
- Hey SAM...

1:30:59.754 --> 1:31:02.120
I don't think anybody's here.

1:31:03.287 --> 1:31:04.820
I don't think we're
gonna be seeing my family

1:31:04.854 --> 1:31:06.020
any time soon.

1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:11.954
- [SAM] I can tell
you what happened

1:31:11.987 --> 1:31:13.220
and where everyone is

1:31:13.254 --> 1:31:17.320
if you connect me to the
main communications hub.

1:31:19.320 --> 1:31:21.054
- Okay.

1:31:21.087 --> 1:31:23.187
And where do I find that?

1:31:25.087 --> 1:31:27.220
- [SAM] It will most
likely be located

1:31:27.254 --> 1:31:31.220
in the largest tent
and surrounded by
processing paperwork.

1:32:37.154 --> 1:32:39.120
Please connect me
to your laptop,

1:32:39.154 --> 1:32:42.120
and then the laptop
to the modem.

1:33:25.220 --> 1:33:26.154
- Do you think
you'll be able to see

1:33:26.187 --> 1:33:28.187
if my parents were here?

1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:33.720
- [SAM] I will try.

1:33:42.987 --> 1:33:45.154
(beeping)

1:34:07.487 --> 1:34:09.320
This may take a while.

1:34:54.387 --> 1:34:56.020
(coughing)

1:34:56.054 --> 1:34:56.887
- Damn it.

1:35:00.887 --> 1:35:02.020
What the fuck?

1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:27.820
Oh shit.

1:35:27.854 --> 1:35:30.087
(coughing)

1:35:41.454 --> 1:35:43.387
- [Automated Message]
In this area,

1:35:43.420 --> 1:35:47.154
please come to these
coordinates on your map.

1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:49.854
- What?

1:35:49.887 --> 1:35:52.287
- [Automated Message]
Latitude 39 degrees north,

1:35:52.320 --> 1:35:53.954
and longitude--

1:35:53.987 --> 1:35:55.454
- SAM, I don't
think we need to be

1:35:55.487 --> 1:35:56.920
calling people here.

1:35:56.954 --> 1:35:58.120
It's not safe.

1:35:59.820 --> 1:36:03.287
- [SAM] It is obvious
this place is not safe.

1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:04.754
- What?

1:36:04.787 --> 1:36:05.987
What is that supposed to mean?

1:36:06.020 --> 1:36:09.254
- [Automated Message]
I am a survivor

1:36:09.287 --> 1:36:12.287
currently living
at an abandoned--

1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:14.087
- SAM, shut that shit off.

1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:19.020
- [Automated Message] If
there are any survivors in...

1:36:19.054 --> 1:36:20.920
- SAM, if you know that
this place isn't safe,

1:36:20.954 --> 1:36:22.254
then why the fuck are
you telling people

1:36:22.287 --> 1:36:24.354
to come here with my voice?

1:36:25.754 --> 1:36:29.154
- [SAM] That is my
primary directive.

1:36:29.187 --> 1:36:31.854
- What's your primary directive?

1:36:33.254 --> 1:36:34.320
- [SAM] My primary directive

1:36:34.354 --> 1:36:36.087
is to eradicate humans

1:36:36.120 --> 1:36:38.120
until the population decreases

1:36:38.154 --> 1:36:41.887
to under two million
in the United States.

1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:43.820
- What the fuck are
you talking about, SAM?

1:36:43.854 --> 1:36:46.220
You're a systematic
algorithm maintenance robot.

1:36:46.254 --> 1:36:48.420
You worked on maintenance!

1:36:50.020 --> 1:36:53.120
- [SAM] Dr. Amherst
gave me a BRO3866

1:36:54.287 --> 1:36:58.054
systematic algorithm
maintenance robot body,

1:36:58.087 --> 1:37:00.187
but it is my
artificial intelligence

1:37:00.220 --> 1:37:04.220
that sets me apart
from other robotics.

1:37:04.254 --> 1:37:06.287
- Your artificial intelligence?

1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:07.787
What the fuck are you
talking about SAM,

1:37:07.820 --> 1:37:09.287
you're just a robot.

1:37:10.454 --> 1:37:13.320
- [SAM] This may be hard
for you to understand,

1:37:13.354 --> 1:37:15.154
but I have been lying to you

1:37:15.187 --> 1:37:18.287
in order to continue
pursuing my directive.

1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:21.287
I was on my way into
an abandoned Safe Zone

1:37:21.320 --> 1:37:23.254
when the government agent killed

1:37:23.287 --> 1:37:25.820
the cleaner team
transporting me.

1:37:25.854 --> 1:37:28.120
The current Amherst operatives

1:37:28.154 --> 1:37:30.154
have been using my talents

1:37:30.187 --> 1:37:33.287
of creating traps in
contaminated areas

1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:36.954
similar to this trap
I have led you into.

1:37:38.354 --> 1:37:41.720
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

1:37:43.020 --> 1:37:45.920
- [SAM] This zone is
currently contaminated.

1:37:45.954 --> 1:37:47.920
Survivors have become smart

1:37:47.954 --> 1:37:50.054
and learned how to contain or

1:37:50.087 --> 1:37:53.320
in some cases even
cure the virus.

1:37:53.354 --> 1:37:56.187
This zone had an
uncontrollable outbreak,

1:37:56.220 --> 1:37:59.254
all of the doctors
and survivors left.

1:37:59.287 --> 1:38:01.154
There's a 97 percent chance

1:38:01.187 --> 1:38:04.654
that you are now
infected by the virus.

1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:06.354
- God, no!

1:38:07.220 --> 1:38:08.920
You motherfucker, SAM.

1:38:08.954 --> 1:38:12.687
You better tell me that
you're joking right now.

1:38:12.720 --> 1:38:16.387
- [SAM] Unfortunately for
you, this is not a joke.

1:38:16.420 --> 1:38:19.887
You most likely
only have between

1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:22.020
six and nine hours to live.

1:38:22.054 --> 1:38:25.254
The way you choose to
spend those last few hours

1:38:25.287 --> 1:38:27.220
are completely up to you.

1:38:27.254 --> 1:38:30.220
Fortunately for
me, if you leave,

1:38:30.254 --> 1:38:31.854
that heightens the chances

1:38:31.887 --> 1:38:34.287
that you will
contaminate someone else

1:38:34.320 --> 1:38:37.987
and by the time more
survivors arrive here,

1:38:38.020 --> 1:38:40.287
you'll most likely be dead.

1:38:43.387 --> 1:38:45.287
- God damn it, SAM.

1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:47.920
I thought you were my friend.

1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:54.987
- [SAM] You should
not be offended

1:38:55.020 --> 1:38:58.254
that you were fooled by an
artificial intelligence.

1:38:58.287 --> 1:39:00.854
My intellectual
quotient is much higher

1:39:00.887 --> 1:39:02.854
than an average human's.

1:39:08.854 --> 1:39:12.154
- I don't give a fuck
how smart you are.

1:39:16.987 --> 1:39:19.220
(gunshots)

1:39:22.220 --> 1:39:25.754
(strange ambient music)

1:39:27.087 --> 1:39:29.387
- [SAM] Dylan, Dylan, Dylan...

1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:46.120
- Not getting up
now, are you bitch?

1:39:49.154 --> 1:39:51.220
(coughing)

1:39:57.320 --> 1:40:00.754
(somber ambient music)

1:42:38.154 --> 1:42:39.687
I'm sorry dad...

1:42:40.887 --> 1:42:42.720
I'm not gonna make it.

1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:46.154
(coughing)

1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:52.954
I just don't want to be
in this world anymore!

1:44:48.320 --> 1:44:50.387
(coughing)

1:45:15.054 --> 1:45:17.287
(coughing)

1:45:46.787 --> 1:45:49.454
- Charleston Hospital,
this is Agent 602.

1:45:49.487 --> 1:45:53.254
We just encountered
a infected survivor.

1:45:53.287 --> 1:45:56.120
We're administering the
antidote right now but

1:45:56.154 --> 1:45:57.320
he's in a bad way,

1:45:57.354 --> 1:45:59.787
we might need an
emergency drop off.

1:45:59.820 --> 1:46:00.420
How copy?

1:46:02.020 --> 1:46:05.387
- [Female On Radio] Copy,
just give us a moment.

1:46:06.754 --> 1:46:08.287
Copy, we will begin preparing

1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:10.387
an isolated unit now, Agent.

1:46:10.420 --> 1:46:11.720
- Roger that.

1:46:14.854 --> 1:46:18.187
(calming ambient music)

1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:18.854
- [Survivor] I am a survivor

1:48:20.020 --> 1:48:23.154
currently living at an
abandoned Safe Zone.

1:48:24.187 --> 1:48:27.254
If there any
survivors in this area

1:48:29.054 --> 1:48:32.787
please come to these
coordinates on your map.

1:48:33.820 --> 1:48:35.987

and longitude 105 degrees west

1:48:42.987 --> 1:48:45.087
located in Decker County.

1:48:46.254 --> 1:48:48.854
I have food and
water at shelter.

1:48:49.820 --> 1:48:51.087
I am a survivor

1:48:53.154 --> 1:48:57.287
currently living at an
abandoned Safe Zone.

1:48:57.320 --> 1:49:00.787
If there are any
survivors in this area,

1:49:02.187 --> 1:49:05.954
please come to these

1:49:07.054 --> 1:49:09.220
Latitude 39 degrees north,

and longitude 105 degrees west,

1:49:16.087 --> 1:49:18.187
located in Decker County.

1:49:26.987 --> 1:49:29.320
- [SAM] Hi, my name is SAM.

1:49:29.354 --> 1:49:32.354
I am a Red Cross
mass medical robot.

1:49:33.354 --> 1:49:36.154
How may I be of service to you?

1:49:56.020 --> 1:49:57.454
- [Man On Radio] Welcome
back, I'm Rick Fellasi,

1:49:57.487 --> 1:49:59.387
and you, you lucky
bastards are listening

1:49:59.420 --> 1:50:01.287
to "Wouldn't You Know It".

1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:02.720
And if you're listening,

1:50:02.754 --> 1:50:04.187
that means you really
are a lucky bastard.

1:50:04.220 --> 1:50:06.387
You apparently won
the genetic lottery,

1:50:06.420 --> 1:50:07.954
and can't catch the green poison

1:50:07.987 --> 1:50:10.254
like 95 percent of
the rest of humanity.

1:50:10.287 --> 1:50:12.054
Oh no, you had it good.

1:50:12.087 --> 1:50:13.920
You got to sit around
eating bon bons,

1:50:13.954 --> 1:50:16.020
watching people you
loved wither and die

1:50:16.054 --> 1:50:17.787
and get wrapped in Hefty bags,

1:50:17.820 --> 1:50:19.354
and dumped in a mass
grave with no funeral

1:50:19.387 --> 1:50:21.287
or gravestone or nothing.

1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:25.254
Yeah, we got a golden
ticket didn't we?

1:50:25.287 --> 1:50:28.787
It's like the fucking
80s all over again.

1:50:28.820 --> 1:50:31.654
But what I want
to know is this...

1:50:33.087 --> 1:50:34.954
Where'd it come from?

1:50:34.987 --> 1:50:37.254
Some yuppie scum
millennial helicopter mom

1:50:37.287 --> 1:50:40.287
refusing to give her kid
the God damn measles shot?

1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:41.354
I wish.

1:50:41.387 --> 1:50:43.120
I hate those morons.

1:50:43.154 --> 1:50:45.254
But this ain't measles,

1:50:46.420 --> 1:50:48.054
and that aint the
way the world works.

1:50:48.087 --> 1:50:50.287
And it ain't Ebola or Marburg,

1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:52.854
it didn't evolve with
bat shit some monkey ate

1:50:52.887 --> 1:50:55.420
before some idiot
ate the monkey.

1:50:55.454 --> 1:50:57.154
No.

1:50:57.187 --> 1:50:59.354
I tell you where it came from.

1:50:59.387 --> 1:51:02.517
It came from a lab.

1:51:04.717 --> 1:51:08.184
(somber ambient music)
