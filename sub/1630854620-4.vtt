Mighty barking thunder dog
in the sky,

00:45.112 --> 00:46.113
please stop barking.

00:46.113 --> 00:48.315
I'll do anything.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.017
Do you want me
to stop licking myself?

00:51.151 --> 00:52.719
Oh, oh, more licking.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.659
Okay, let's get to me,
'cause Honey's human

00:58.659 --> 01:01.195
should be gettin' home soon to
cry and pill herself to sleep.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.996
We have time.
Jill's volunteering

01:02.996 --> 01:04.965
at the shelter
for National Pet Adoption Day.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.034
And when it rains,
she pulls her car over

01:07.034 --> 01:08.335
to calmly wait it out.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.774
Well, then I'll share
something small.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.077
When I left, Kevin was packing
his big green suitcase.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.312
He's leaving me for good
this time.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.947
I mean, do I blame him? No.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.281
I'm just a useless, dumb,

01:21.281 --> 01:22.816
and "overweight
according to society's

01:22.816 --> 01:24.518
warped perception of beauty"
cat.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.386
Chico, if you want others
to love you,

01:26.386 --> 01:28.188
you need
to love yourself first.

01:28.188 --> 01:30.490
Or you need to follow Kevin,

01:30.490 --> 01:33.493
find out where he's going and
why he's always abandoning you,

01:33.493 --> 01:36.196
and then change everything
about yourself

01:36.196 --> 01:37.497
to get him to come back to you.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.299
- That's ridiculous.
- That's brilliant.

01:39.299 --> 01:42.135
And as your kooky,
less attractive BFF,

01:42.135 --> 01:43.837
it's my job to go with you.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.372
Let's go!

01:45.372 --> 01:47.841
If we hurry, we may be able
to sneak into his suitcase

01:47.841 --> 01:49.209
before he finishes
his preflight

01:49.209 --> 01:51.411
crotch-lotioning-sock ritual.

01:52.145 --> 01:53.514
Well, that was boring.

01:53.514 --> 01:56.950
Luckily for you losers,
I have something so personal,

01:56.950 --> 01:58.051
so troubling--

01:58.051 --> 01:59.786
Hey, where did Tchotchke go?

02:01.221 --> 02:02.656
Oh, no,
it's happening again!

02:02.656 --> 02:05.259
The terrifying, bloodthirsty
basement monsters

02:05.259 --> 02:07.127
must have gotten Tchotchke!

02:09.062 --> 02:11.465
According to lore,

02:11.465 --> 02:13.100
which is short for Lori,

02:13.100 --> 02:15.469
every
National Pet Adoption Day,

02:15.469 --> 02:20.174
the basement monsters emerge
from their subterranean lair

02:20.174 --> 02:23.477
and exact revenge on pets...

02:23.477 --> 02:26.079
pets like us.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.818
Oh, silly Diablo,
that's just a story

02:31.818 --> 02:33.754
we tell our kids
if we could have any.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.022
The real monsters
are the ones

02:35.022 --> 02:36.356
that live inside of us.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.025
Burn the house down, Nibbles.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.993
Make fire happy.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.862
Basement monsters are real!

02:41.862 --> 02:43.597
And they're coming for me--

02:43.597 --> 02:44.565
well, for all of us,

02:44.565 --> 02:47.234
but it's mostly me
I'm concerned about!

02:47.234 --> 02:48.836
This is a wonderful opportunity

02:48.836 --> 02:50.204
for immersion therapy,

02:50.204 --> 02:52.206
the technique where I,
the therapist,

02:52.206 --> 02:54.408
cure the patient of their fear
by immersing them

02:54.408 --> 02:56.476
in whatever it is
that frightens them.

02:56.476 --> 03:00.714
Ooh, I'm afraid of naughty
Catholic school turtles.

03:00.814 --> 03:01.648
Come on, Diablo.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.917
It's time for you to overcome
this silly fear.

03:03.917 --> 03:07.187
Honey, Honey,
this is a huge violation!

03:07.187 --> 03:10.057
But it is quite soothing
to be carried.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.759
Honey!
Honey, no! Please!

03:12.759 --> 03:13.627
Let me out!

03:13.760 --> 03:16.163
I cannot wait
to be deposed about this.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.632
Trust me, Diablo.
I know what I'm doing.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.101
Honey, what do we do?

03:21.101 --> 03:22.836
The scary barking dog
in the sky

03:22.836 --> 03:24.371
is barking in the sky!

03:24.371 --> 03:26.306
I-I-I don't have time
for this, Chief.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.775
I'm trying to get Diablo
to confront his fears.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.878
Confront fears...

03:30.878 --> 03:32.179
and the other words you said

03:32.179 --> 03:33.714
that relate
to my current predicament.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.249
Thanks, Honey!
- Have fun.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.350
No!

03:36.350 --> 03:38.352
Honey, this does not
seem ethical,

03:38.352 --> 03:40.420
but it is the content
I come for.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.123
Yeah, Diablo sounds
truly terrified.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.726
To the untrained ear, maybe,
but to a professional,

03:45.726 --> 03:49.162
those are the bloodcurdling
screams of healing.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.131
And healed.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.166
Diablo, you may now come out

03:53.166 --> 03:54.401
and enjoy your life

03:54.401 --> 03:56.770
unencumbered
by irrational fears

03:56.770 --> 03:58.172
based on nonsense.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.311
Diablo?

04:04.311 --> 04:06.413
Okay, Honey killed Diablo.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.982
Pay up.
- Not until I see the body.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.190
Why would Kevin

04:16.190 --> 04:18.992
rather live here forever
than live with me?

04:18.992 --> 04:20.761
I don't know. Let's ask him.

04:20.861 --> 04:21.795
I'm Kevin.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.997
I'm here because I'm stupid
and I don't realize

04:23.997 --> 04:26.834
that I live with the greatest
cat in the world.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.002
Hey, don't call Kevin stupid,
Kevin!

04:35.042 --> 04:37.110
Kevin?

04:38.812 --> 04:40.981
Hurry up
and find Diablo already

04:40.981 --> 04:43.383
so I can get
into my thing!

04:43.383 --> 04:44.618
Diablo!

04:44.618 --> 04:47.688
Diablo, if you're trying
to make me look bad,

04:47.688 --> 04:48.956
it's not working.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.991
It's not not working.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.526
Guys, look.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.261
The basement monsters

04:54.261 --> 04:56.463
dragged Diablo
into that crawlspace.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.833
Or Diablo thought this
was a way out

04:59.833 --> 05:02.069
and, um, got so excited,

05:02.069 --> 05:04.037
he dragged his paws
along the ground

05:04.037 --> 05:05.472
while walking backwards,

05:05.472 --> 05:07.574
leaving behind
several of his nails,

05:07.674 --> 05:09.676
which he had dipped in ketchup.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.378
Yeah, blood-flavored ketchup.

05:11.378 --> 05:13.914
Come on, let's go find him
and prove I'm right.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.616
Charge!

05:15.616 --> 05:18.318
If you guys are afraid,
you can go upstairs

05:18.318 --> 05:20.654
and listen to Max
talk about himself.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.922
all: Charge!

05:24.558 --> 05:26.593
It's time to confront--

05:27.895 --> 05:29.429
Chief, what are you doin'?

05:29.429 --> 05:31.832
It's rainin'
cats and yous out there!

05:31.832 --> 05:33.100
Well, I was gonna stand up

05:33.100 --> 05:35.435
to the giant barking dog
in the sky,

05:35.435 --> 05:39.106
but have you ever seen
how high the sky is?

05:39.106 --> 05:41.008
Well, you could climb
the radio tower

05:41.008 --> 05:42.109
at the end of the LA River.

05:42.242 --> 05:45.312
Then you'd be face-to-face
with the scary barking dog.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.181
And also,
our Frisbee is up there,

05:47.181 --> 05:50.017
so if you could grab that,
that'd be fire.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.752
Radio tower?

05:51.752 --> 05:52.619
Perfect.

05:52.619 --> 05:55.189
But how do we get there?
It's flooding.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.757
Easy.
We'll build a boat.

05:56.757 --> 05:57.624
Yes!

05:57.624 --> 05:59.927

06:10.270 --> 06:11.305

06:11.305 --> 06:13.040
I've never been more proud
of anything

06:13.040 --> 06:15.409
in my entire life.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.580
- Huh?
- Hey, a box.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.815
I've never been more proud
of anything

06:21.815 --> 06:23.250
in my entire life.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.084
Get in.

06:28.455 --> 06:31.091
Diablo, come on out
and tell everyone

06:31.091 --> 06:33.527
how cured you are
because of me.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.897
I think I hear something
coming from that grate.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.468
Diablo?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.006
We're jump-scare bats.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.541
It's what we do.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.742
Oof! For a second there,

06:48.742 --> 06:50.210
I thought we were
in real danger.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.145
Blahhh!

06:53.780 --> 06:55.082
Great job, Tabitha.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.783
We're trapped.
- We're trapped?

07:01.455 --> 07:04.258
- Is that dead guy Kevin?
- I don't know.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.326
I've never seen
what Kevin looks like dead.

07:06.326 --> 07:09.730
But if it is Kevin,
then maybe, just maybe,

07:09.730 --> 07:13.700
I'd be able to wake him up
with true love's first kiss.

07:13.700 --> 07:14.801
You're not suggesting
that you--

07:14.801 --> 07:17.271
Oh, oh! Chico, no!

07:18.038 --> 07:19.439
Eh, guess he's not Kevin.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.608
Guess not.
But just to be sure...

07:22.309 --> 07:24.411
Chico, this is not healthy!

07:25.579 --> 07:28.715
Ooh, string. Let's pull it.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.925
Well, that was a long scream.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.126
We're all gonna die,

07:39.126 --> 07:40.494
even the two of us
who don't deserve to.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.896
We're not going to die
if we just stay calm!

07:42.896 --> 07:44.598
So let's just split up

07:44.598 --> 07:47.234
into two groups
so we can find Diablo.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.869
Fine.
I'll go with Shel and Elsa.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.938
No fair, why do you guys
get three animals,

07:50.938 --> 07:52.172
we only have two?

07:52.172 --> 07:53.574
Shel, you're with us.

07:53.574 --> 07:54.875
Now, ladies, I don't like

07:54.875 --> 07:56.276
hearing you fight over me,

07:56.276 --> 07:58.378
but I would like to see it.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.447
Why don't we just
pick names out of a hat?

08:00.447 --> 08:02.316
Now, who knows
how to write our names,

08:02.316 --> 08:04.184
or use a pen, or has a hat?

08:04.184 --> 08:05.953
Guys, look down there!

08:05.953 --> 08:08.288
It's a way out! We're saved!

08:12.626 --> 08:16.697
Well, now we can pair up
evenly... yeah?

08:22.032 --> 08:23.801
The monsters got Nibbles.

08:23.801 --> 08:26.103
Game over, man. Game over.

08:26.103 --> 08:27.504
We should have stayed
in group

08:27.504 --> 08:29.940
and listened to pig
talk about himself.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.442
Don't say that!

08:31.542 --> 08:33.377
Don't you ever say that!

08:33.377 --> 08:35.279
All right,
we're going to be fine.

08:35.279 --> 08:37.981
If we just stick together
and stay calm,

08:37.981 --> 08:39.583
I'm sure we'll find Diablo,

08:39.583 --> 08:41.885
and Nibbles, and Tchotchke.

08:45.289 --> 08:46.390
And Tabitha.

08:46.390 --> 08:47.224
Maybe we should--

08:47.224 --> 08:49.326
and I'm just spitballing here--

08:49.326 --> 08:51.762
scream
and run in all directions.

08:58.202 --> 09:00.571
Great job, Tabitha.

09:07.244 --> 09:08.412
Whew.

09:11.281 --> 09:12.416
Oh, it's you.

09:12.416 --> 09:15.886
Shel, could my inability
to admit I was wrong

09:15.886 --> 09:17.154
have gotten everyone killed?

09:17.254 --> 09:20.157
Don't beat yourself up--
not everyone.

09:20.157 --> 09:22.960
Oh, now it's everyone!

09:30.067 --> 09:31.135
<i>This is a nightmare!</i>

09:31.135 --> 09:32.236
We're trapped with a pack

09:32.236 --> 09:34.404
of gigantic
multicolored animals.

09:34.404 --> 09:37.040
I don't know how Kevin got
mixed up with these creatures,

09:37.040 --> 09:39.243
but I do know he's in danger.

09:39.243 --> 09:41.411
You smell that?
Kevin is close.

09:41.512 --> 09:42.613
We have to find him
before he ends up

09:42.613 --> 09:45.816
like that great kisser we met
in the luggage cargo.

09:50.821 --> 09:53.123
Mm, very garbage-forward

09:53.123 --> 09:55.959
with hints of hepatitis C.

09:55.959 --> 09:58.395
Uh, guys?

10:08.338 --> 10:09.873
Oh, no!

10:13.877 --> 10:15.379
Our boat!

10:19.883 --> 10:22.853
Small Fun Raccoon,
take my handlike paw!

10:26.890 --> 10:29.259
No!

10:31.328 --> 10:33.897
<i>And just like that,
Small died.</i>

10:41.171 --> 10:43.373
Diablo? Shel?
And the rest?

10:43.373 --> 10:44.508
You're all alive!

10:44.508 --> 10:45.776
Which I knew all along.

10:45.776 --> 10:46.877
Where are we?

10:46.877 --> 10:47.911
We've been taken

10:48.011 --> 10:48.946
to the basement monster's
nest

10:49.113 --> 10:52.049
to be used as living prey
for the larva hatchlings

10:52.049 --> 10:54.418
that were implanted
inside us...

10:54.418 --> 10:55.686
I'm assuming.

10:55.686 --> 10:59.022
So... anybody want
to finally admit

10:59.022 --> 11:00.157
they screwed up?

11:00.157 --> 11:01.892
Hmm, yeah, anybody?

11:01.892 --> 11:03.527
Anybody? No?

11:03.527 --> 11:05.996
Well, I guess no one
screwed up, Tabitha.

11:05.996 --> 11:07.731
What a weird question.

11:12.102 --> 11:13.670
Look, it's Tchotchke.

11:13.670 --> 11:15.205
I told you! We're saved!

11:15.205 --> 11:16.840
all: Yay!

11:16.840 --> 11:18.275
Followed by a bunch

11:18.275 --> 11:20.677
of terrifying
basement monsters.

11:20.677 --> 11:21.912
We're doomed!

11:21.912 --> 11:23.480
all: Boo!

11:23.480 --> 11:24.715
What's Tchotchke doing?

11:24.715 --> 11:26.283
He's trying
to tell us something.

11:26.283 --> 11:29.853
Guys, I'll interpret.
I'm fluent in Tchotchke-ese.

11:29.953 --> 11:31.221
Don't be scared.

11:31.221 --> 11:34.258
These are my friends,
my discarded friends.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.292
They are...

11:46.770 --> 11:47.738
<i>And...</i>

11:50.741 --> 11:52.709
You see, every year,

11:52.709 --> 11:54.945
<i>thousands of animals
are adopted</i>

11:54.945 --> 11:57.314
<i>on National Pet Adoption Day.</i>

11:57.314 --> 12:00.417
<i>But hipsters
often adopt exotic animals</i>

12:00.417 --> 12:03.120
<i>just to have something
to post on social.</i>

12:03.120 --> 12:06.023
<i>Soon after my friends
were taken in,</i>

12:06.023 --> 12:07.524
<i>their owners lost interest.</i>

12:07.524 --> 12:11.795
<i>They lived as nomads like
that Frances McDormand movie</i>

12:11.795 --> 12:15.866
<i>no one saw
but pretended to like.</i>

12:15.866 --> 12:17.067
Ah!

12:19.770 --> 12:22.039
<i>I found some
of the survivors</i>

12:22.039 --> 12:25.909
<i>and snuck them here
under Jill's house for safety,</i>

12:25.909 --> 12:28.312
<i>where they've since lived
in secret.</i>

12:28.412 --> 12:30.380
That is literally
the saddest thing

12:30.380 --> 12:33.117
I've ever lost interest in
halfway through.

12:33.117 --> 12:35.052
Why didn't you tell us,
Tchotchke?

12:35.052 --> 12:37.621
Being abandoned
creates trust issues,

12:37.621 --> 12:41.024
so they made me keep
their existence a secret,

12:41.125 --> 12:43.994
which I understand
because I, too,

12:43.994 --> 12:46.063
am a glazed doughnut.

12:46.063 --> 12:48.899
Oh, sorry, I misinterpreted.

12:48.999 --> 12:52.302
I, too, am a discarded pet.

12:52.302 --> 12:54.605
all: Aww.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.842
Kevin?
Kevin?

12:58.842 --> 13:00.544
Buckle up, Furries.

13:00.544 --> 13:03.147
<i>It's gonna be a bumpy ride,
but we're going to get you</i>

13:03.147 --> 13:06.750
<i>to your convention safely
and on time.</i>

13:06.750 --> 13:08.418
Smell that?

13:08.418 --> 13:09.987
My bad.

13:09.987 --> 13:12.122
Turns out,
flying makes me nervous.

13:12.122 --> 13:13.390
No, I'm saying

13:13.490 --> 13:14.691
I smell Kevin above us.

13:14.691 --> 13:15.759
Come on.

13:19.029 --> 13:22.299
Oh, my God,
this creature ate my Kevin!

13:22.299 --> 13:24.735
Now he's really
never gonna come home.

13:29.139 --> 13:31.208
Aw, we should probably
give up.

13:31.208 --> 13:34.745
No, Small Fun would have
wanted us to continue,

13:34.845 --> 13:36.713
is something you say
in these situations.

13:36.814 --> 13:38.048
Plus, look over there.

13:41.952 --> 13:43.987
You really think
I can do this?

13:43.987 --> 13:45.289
Oh, not at all.

13:45.289 --> 13:47.324
Small Fun was the one
who believed in you.

13:47.324 --> 13:48.425
Then he died.

13:48.425 --> 13:50.027
But at this point, I mean,
we're here, right?

13:50.027 --> 13:52.563
You're right, we are here!

13:52.563 --> 13:54.965
♪ Climbing a ladder
to confront the dog ♪

13:59.937 --> 14:01.638
Kevin's dead!

14:01.638 --> 14:04.308
D-S-Q-P, dead!

14:05.409 --> 14:07.544
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
- Oh, my God!

14:07.544 --> 14:09.513
Kevin's still alive
inside that mutant freak.

14:09.513 --> 14:12.883
- Can I get a Diet Coke?
- And he's thirsty.

14:12.883 --> 14:15.152
Poor guy
is being digested alive,

14:15.152 --> 14:17.521
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

14:20.757 --> 14:22.493
Hand me that puke bag.

14:22.493 --> 14:24.261
I have a better idea.

14:24.261 --> 14:26.864
I'm coming,
partially digested Kevin!

14:30.734 --> 14:32.736
Tchotchke,
why have you never told us

14:32.736 --> 14:33.937
you're a discarded pet?

14:33.937 --> 14:36.140
I've always felt
great shame.

14:36.240 --> 14:39.042
You see, I was bought
by a mystery celebrity--

14:39.143 --> 14:41.311
let's call him
Pustin Peeber--

14:41.311 --> 14:44.114
<i>who paraded me around
as a trophy pet.</i>

14:44.114 --> 14:45.482
<i>But the second he learned</i>

14:45.482 --> 14:48.352
<i>he couldn't travel with me
to Orlando,</i>

14:48.352 --> 14:51.655
<i>I was tossed away
like garbage.</i>

14:55.159 --> 14:57.227
That's heartbreaking, Tchotchke...

14:57.227 --> 14:58.695
and exactly the kind of thing

14:58.695 --> 15:00.264
we could have addressed
in therapy.

15:00.264 --> 15:02.933
And none of you have to worry.

15:02.933 --> 15:05.569
Your secret is safe with us.

15:05.569 --> 15:09.139
See? You didn't have
to terrorize and kidnap them.

15:09.139 --> 15:12.476
This group is my family.
We can let them go.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.745
Sorry, upstairs pets.

15:15.546 --> 15:17.281
We've been listening
to your group

15:17.281 --> 15:18.615
through that vent for months,

15:18.615 --> 15:21.285
and we've heard Honey
talk about loving yourself

15:21.285 --> 15:23.220
and being worthy of happiness.

15:23.220 --> 15:26.056
Well, we deserve
a good life too,

15:26.056 --> 15:28.759
the kind of life
you upstairs animals have.

15:28.759 --> 15:30.961
So we're going
to take your lives,

15:30.961 --> 15:32.262
like in that hit movie "Us"

15:32.262 --> 15:34.031
we also heard
through the vent.

15:34.031 --> 15:36.633
Any last words?

15:36.633 --> 15:37.367
What are you?

15:37.367 --> 15:39.103
I'm a ferret put on steroids

15:39.103 --> 15:40.370
to look like a poodle.

15:40.370 --> 15:42.873
People do that
to smuggle us in the country.

15:42.873 --> 15:44.708
Find out more here.

15:44.708 --> 15:47.044
BRB never!

15:48.779 --> 15:52.249
Oh, God.
Tchotchke really let us down.

15:55.018 --> 15:57.521
The water's rising.
What do we do?

15:57.521 --> 15:59.590
I don't know,
but it's not my fault!

15:59.590 --> 16:00.657
I didn't do anything wrong.

16:00.657 --> 16:02.960
And I'm never wrong, never.
Never, never, never.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.428
- Honey's broken.
- Not to worry.

16:04.428 --> 16:07.564
Max has probably seen
the discarded pets by now

16:07.564 --> 16:09.366
and is on his way to rescue us.

16:09.366 --> 16:12.369
I mean it is amazing
how fast you can go from,

16:12.369 --> 16:14.638
"Oh, my God,
I'm talking to Nic Cage,"

16:14.638 --> 16:18.142
to, "Oh, my God, someone
get me away from Nic Cage."

16:18.142 --> 16:20.277
Nibbles, you get it.

16:20.277 --> 16:23.046
But we probably
shouldn't count on it.

16:23.046 --> 16:25.382
I can reach you, Diablo,

16:25.382 --> 16:27.484
but your paw's gotta go.

16:27.484 --> 16:29.953
Wait, what?
Just chew through the rope!

16:29.953 --> 16:32.055
Okay, fine.

16:32.055 --> 16:34.291
Quick, untie the rest of us.

16:35.859 --> 16:37.294
I can't do it!

16:37.294 --> 16:39.263
I guess now is a good time
to tell you

16:39.263 --> 16:41.432
that I don't have
any top teeth.

16:41.432 --> 16:42.900
- Eww.
- Yuck.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.268
Diablo,
climb through those vents

16:44.268 --> 16:45.836
and open the door
on the other side.

16:45.836 --> 16:48.605
No way, it is too scary
and dark in there.

16:48.605 --> 16:50.374
And what about
the vent monsters?

16:50.374 --> 16:53.777
They are way worse
than the basement monsters!

16:54.845 --> 16:56.146
You got this, Chief!

16:56.146 --> 16:59.750
He's just as scared of you
as you are of him...

16:59.750 --> 17:04.087
is also something I've heard
people say in these situations.

17:04.087 --> 17:06.623
He's just as afraid of me?

17:08.258 --> 17:10.394
Listen, buddy.
I get it.

17:10.394 --> 17:12.396
I know what it's like
to be scared.

17:12.396 --> 17:16.767
But giving in to that fear has
turned you into a giant dingus.

17:16.767 --> 17:19.136
Underneath all that sky drama,

17:19.136 --> 17:21.371
I bet you're a really good boy.

17:21.371 --> 17:24.842
And I'm sure if we got to know
each other, we'd be friends.

17:24.842 --> 17:26.677
So what do you say?

17:26.677 --> 17:28.378
Friends?

17:32.416 --> 17:35.085
So... no Frisbee?

17:35.953 --> 17:37.955
Mine was blue.

17:37.955 --> 17:40.257
Ew, ew!

17:44.461 --> 17:45.996
Kevin, hold on!

17:45.996 --> 17:48.298
Don't let him digest you!

18:03.147 --> 18:05.149
Kevin, you're still alive!

18:05.149 --> 18:07.084
We killed the beast!

18:07.084 --> 18:08.986
Chico?
What are you doing here?

18:08.986 --> 18:10.621
I love you too!

18:10.621 --> 18:12.122
Uh, this is your captain.

18:12.122 --> 18:13.524
<i>One of our engines is out,</i>

18:13.524 --> 18:16.260
<i>so we have to turn around
and head back to Burbank.</i>

18:16.260 --> 18:19.229
Oh, great.
Guess we're going home.

18:19.229 --> 18:21.298
We're going home?
Together?

18:21.298 --> 18:22.266
I did it.

18:22.266 --> 18:24.968
I saved you,
and I won you back.

18:24.968 --> 18:26.837
No hard feelings, man.
I get it.

18:26.837 --> 18:29.273
If I had a mouth your size,
I'd eat him too.

18:29.373 --> 18:32.142
I don't want to die!

18:32.142 --> 18:35.012
- I'm too young to go.
- Oh, guys.

18:35.012 --> 18:36.480
I'm so sorry that my fears

18:36.480 --> 18:38.882
are preventing me
from saving all of you.

18:38.882 --> 18:40.150
Wait, no, Diablo.

18:40.150 --> 18:42.352
You can't die thinking
this is your fault.

18:42.352 --> 18:43.854
It's my f--

18:43.854 --> 18:46.156
it's my f... ault.

18:46.156 --> 18:47.891
That's right,
because of my hubris,

18:47.991 --> 18:49.126
we're all going to die.

18:49.126 --> 18:51.929
See, Honey?
Was that so difficult?

18:51.929 --> 18:54.131
Wow Honey,
finally admitting

18:54.131 --> 18:56.533
you were wrong about something
was really brave.

18:56.633 --> 19:00.104
And if you can be that brave,
then maybe I can too!

19:00.104 --> 19:02.339
I'll be back!

19:02.339 --> 19:03.941
Thank you, Honey!

19:03.941 --> 19:06.076
Because of you,
I am overcoming--

19:06.076 --> 19:07.244
- Go!
- Hurry up!

19:07.244 --> 19:08.679
Jeez!

19:08.679 --> 19:10.881
Hurry!

19:10.881 --> 19:12.916
Don't drown yet!

19:12.916 --> 19:14.118
I'm coming!

19:14.118 --> 19:17.955
That's what she s--

19:24.428 --> 19:26.163
- Thank you!
- Diablo, you saved us!

19:26.163 --> 19:27.564
Saving us was the easy part.

19:27.564 --> 19:29.833
Believing he could save us,
that's the work.

19:29.933 --> 19:31.168
You're welcome.

19:31.168 --> 19:34.338
So now I've got Nic Cage
showing up all the time.

19:34.338 --> 19:36.473
He wants to get
matching tattoos.

19:36.473 --> 19:39.943
It's like, I know
you're lonely, but, dude,

19:39.943 --> 19:42.713
isn't there some Coppola
you can talk to?

19:42.713 --> 19:44.515
Max, get away
from those animals!

19:44.515 --> 19:46.416
They're basement monsters!

19:46.416 --> 19:47.551
Actually,
they're discarded pets

19:47.551 --> 19:50.420
who have no homes and just want
to be loved, but still!

19:50.420 --> 19:52.923
And they want to replace us
and take over our lives.

19:52.923 --> 19:54.258
Even Diablo's life.

19:54.258 --> 19:55.993
It's time to go to war.

19:55.993 --> 19:57.861
Yes! Yes!

19:57.861 --> 19:59.530
Attack!

19:59.530 --> 20:02.900
Discarded pets, fight back!

20:02.900 --> 20:05.335
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, time-out.

20:05.335 --> 20:07.538
Just so I understand
what's happening,

20:07.538 --> 20:09.673
you guys are not you guys?

20:09.673 --> 20:10.340
Exactly.

20:10.340 --> 20:11.542
And you want to kill them

20:11.542 --> 20:13.343
because they're loved
and they have homes?

20:13.343 --> 20:15.245
- Exactly!
- Okay, cool, cool, cool.

20:15.245 --> 20:16.980
As you were.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.282
Hey, I'm sorry
to interrupt again,

20:18.282 --> 20:20.384
but what if instead of having
a bloody battle

20:20.384 --> 20:22.186
that's probably gonna ruin
the couch,

20:22.186 --> 20:25.022
I could find
you discarded pets a home

20:25.022 --> 20:27.124
with a famous lonely bachelor

20:27.124 --> 20:28.892
who could really use
the company?

20:28.892 --> 20:30.093
What do you think?

20:35.499 --> 20:37.267
Hey there, little guys.

20:37.267 --> 20:39.570
You sure look like
you could use a loving home

20:39.570 --> 20:41.438
with lots of dark secrets.

20:41.438 --> 20:43.974
What do you say?

20:43.974 --> 20:46.710
I love you, Nic Cage.

20:46.710 --> 20:48.011
You're not monsters.

20:48.011 --> 20:50.314
The humans
who discarded you are.

20:50.314 --> 20:53.250
Don't get a pet
you can't take care of...

20:53.250 --> 20:56.453
or a dinosaur skull
you can't liquidate.

21:05.329 --> 21:08.165
Small Fun!
Huh, you're alive!

21:08.165 --> 21:10.200
Thanks to this bag.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.936
I don't know why they call it
single-use plastic,

21:12.936 --> 21:14.872
'cause it held
a tuna fish sandwich

21:14.872 --> 21:16.907
and saved my life.

21:16.907 --> 21:19.510
I did it!

21:19.510 --> 21:22.846
The giant barking dog
in the sky is gone!

21:22.846 --> 21:24.448
I did it!

21:24.448 --> 21:26.617
Yay, and I accomplished
my thing too.

21:26.617 --> 21:29.820
And now we have nothing
to be scared of ever ag--

21:33.891 --> 21:35.926
Bento.

21:36.693 --> 21:37.661
<i>That's nice, Jen and Gabby.</i>
