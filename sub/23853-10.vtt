WEBVTT

00:01.728 --> 00:04.696
You've been stealing profits
from me and Chet.

00:04.783 --> 00:07.739
Probably shouldn't have
put it all in an e-mail, Gary.

00:07.924 --> 00:11.146
- I need a job.
- Now is not a good time.

00:11.398 --> 00:14.153
I'm concerned about Rachel.
I'm here to help my patient.

00:14.323 --> 00:16.800
You're one of the
smartest people I've ever met.

00:17.176 --> 00:18.914
Hey. Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

00:19.001 --> 00:21.528
- What does it look like I'm doing?
- No, this is totally inappropriate.

00:21.615 --> 00:22.659
Mnh-mnh.

00:22.727 --> 00:23.886
You should get out of here.

00:23.954 --> 00:25.396
Come work for me.

00:25.511 --> 00:27.793
Really, your CIA mind-game tricks,

00:27.880 --> 00:29.462
I mean, that is valuable.

00:29.549 --> 00:31.297
Tonight is gonna be amazing.

00:31.384 --> 00:34.700
So excited to spend it together
as an actual power couple.

00:34.787 --> 00:36.135
What is Robin doing here?

00:36.222 --> 00:38.304
Robin's article lays out
all the dirt on you,

00:38.391 --> 00:40.366
- so I'm gonna fire you.
- You seem to be forgetting

00:40.453 --> 00:42.471
about a little thing
called leverage.

00:42.558 --> 00:44.213
All those e-mails that I have.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.866
How confident are you that, uh,
you still have those e-mails?

00:47.953 --> 00:50.177
You wiped my computer clean.
You're fired.

00:50.264 --> 00:53.014
- I didn't do that.
- Just don't ever come back.

00:53.101 --> 00:54.217
Only two men...

00:54.304 --> 00:56.159
I wish tonight hadn't gone
the way it did.

00:56.284 --> 00:58.646
Oh, August, I have to say
goodbye to you tonight.

00:58.733 --> 01:00.955
- So, the job is mine?
- You deliver, I deliver.

01:01.042 --> 01:03.154
I wasn't sure you'd go against
your pal like this.

01:03.275 --> 01:04.989
It's not personal. It's business.

01:05.150 --> 01:08.211
You still have drama going on.
I see how you look at her.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.857
- Jeremy...
- I killed two people for you,

01:10.955 --> 01:12.651
'cause I thought
that I-I loved you.

01:12.767 --> 01:14.380
I'm a murderer.

01:16.603 --> 01:19.607
Okay, Fiona, I know
I left like 37 messages,

01:19.694 --> 01:21.848
but I really need you to
get back to me.

01:21.935 --> 01:23.852
There is a slightly
devastating article

01:23.939 --> 01:25.981
coming out about me in
<i>The National Page</i>

01:26.068 --> 01:29.965
and I need your
lesbian mafia muscle, okay?

01:30.052 --> 01:31.716
Where the hell are you?

01:32.146 --> 01:33.373
Rachel?!

01:33.896 --> 01:35.198
Rachel?!

01:35.779 --> 01:37.308
Rachel, are you...?

01:37.599 --> 01:41.110
Come on, not even
my troll person is available?!

01:46.279 --> 01:47.373
Oh.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.571
Well, that's depressing

01:55.863 --> 01:58.181
It's the worst day ever.

01:59.188 --> 02:01.954
Ah! Damn it!

02:40.901 --> 02:43.255
It's gonna be a great
day, after all.

02:47.775 --> 02:49.868
Good morning, Sleeping Beauty.

02:49.957 --> 02:52.623
- Good morning.
- Got a big day ahead of ourselves.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.415
Look, I'm sorry. I know
this should be about you,

02:55.502 --> 02:57.454
but I've been obsessing
about this all night.

02:57.541 --> 02:58.962
Were you serious about
that job off...

02:59.049 --> 03:01.016
I mean, it's totally fine
if you weren't, it really is.

03:01.103 --> 03:02.718
I just... I'm looking for
a little bit of clarity.

03:02.805 --> 03:05.575
Of course I was serious
about the job offer.

03:05.812 --> 03:07.490
I don't mean to sound ridiculous.

03:07.577 --> 03:10.117
You and I, we could
change the world.

03:10.204 --> 03:11.767
Does not sound ridiculous.

03:11.854 --> 03:13.208
How does it sound?

03:13.808 --> 03:15.683
It sounds like
if I could put to good use

03:15.770 --> 03:17.747
all the stuff that Quinn taught me,

03:18.635 --> 03:21.974
the last four years of my life
won't have been an absolute waste.

03:22.331 --> 03:23.895
Consider yourself out.

03:24.369 --> 03:25.746
You're gonna shit yourself.

03:25.833 --> 03:28.979
Not in this suit.
It's too expensive to dry clean.

03:30.731 --> 03:32.053
Son of a bitch.

03:32.140 --> 03:33.461
Mm-hmm.

03:33.661 --> 03:35.989
So that's why she's not
returning my calls.

03:36.076 --> 03:39.221
She sold me out because
I didn't give her a job?

03:39.400 --> 03:41.583
Looks like you fired
the wrong person.

03:41.978 --> 03:43.190
Madison. You fired Madison.

03:43.277 --> 03:45.419
No, I know who I fired, Chet.

03:45.506 --> 03:47.087
I called in every favor I had

03:47.174 --> 03:49.056
to try to get that article
about you killed.

03:49.143 --> 03:50.876
None of my fixers
could get any traction,

03:50.963 --> 03:52.053
and they've pulled me out of

03:52.140 --> 03:53.808
much deeper shit than this before.

03:53.895 --> 03:55.204
Oh, that's fantastic.

03:55.291 --> 03:57.045
I'm beginning to think
there's something to that

03:57.132 --> 03:59.494
whole double-standard thing
you go on and on about.

03:59.581 --> 04:01.596
This town really is
tougher on the ladies.

04:01.683 --> 04:02.775
You think?

04:02.990 --> 04:04.997
This is a nightmare.

04:05.693 --> 04:07.661
Could we talk about
finding you a husband now?

04:07.748 --> 04:08.938
Yeah, but which one?

04:09.025 --> 04:10.506
- First, there's Jasper...
- Okay.

04:10.593 --> 04:11.606
Who is amazing.

04:11.693 --> 04:13.694
But I wish that I could
put Jasper and Owen together

04:13.781 --> 04:15.905
- into one person. I mean, that...
- Can you stop, seriously?

04:15.992 --> 04:17.747
This is how single people talk.

04:17.985 --> 04:21.380
Honestly, this obsession with
the imaginary perfect guy.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.719
You can't just Google up
your customized person.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.592
Maybe we should invest
in a company that does that.

04:25.679 --> 04:28.575
You're just scared that it's not gonna
be perfect and here's the truth,

04:28.734 --> 04:30.391
it's not going to be.

04:30.478 --> 04:33.080
But it can still be amazing,
and you just have to decide

04:33.167 --> 04:34.962
what kind of amazing
you want it to be.

04:35.049 --> 04:36.988
And that is what I'm
gonna help you do.

04:39.417 --> 04:40.712
All right, all right.

04:40.799 --> 04:42.454
Come on, let's go.
We've got work to do.

04:42.541 --> 04:43.938
- Let's hear this.
- Okay. All right.

04:44.025 --> 04:46.618
So, you finally got your
"Upstairs, Downstairs" finale.

04:46.705 --> 04:48.910
But Serena can't decide if she
wants to buy slow or sell high.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.727
What, 10 weeks and she
still can't pick?

04:50.814 --> 04:53.360
I'm thinking we bring both guys
and their families

04:53.447 --> 04:54.715
to Connecticut to meet her parents.

04:54.802 --> 04:56.278
- What?
- So I win?

04:56.377 --> 04:58.289
I mean, Jasper's
obviously gonna slay

04:58.376 --> 05:00.134
with the Connecticut
country club set

05:00.221 --> 05:01.695
and Owen, not so much.

05:01.782 --> 05:03.491
I don't know. I think
that she's been

05:03.578 --> 05:05.927
rejecting guys like Jasper
for the last 12 years.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.506
Owen might be exactly
what she's been waiting for.

05:08.593 --> 05:12.039
Yeah, but he's also your guy,
so why take that chance?

05:12.126 --> 05:14.587
What kind of ambush
are you planning this year?

05:14.674 --> 05:16.304
I'm not planning an ambush.

05:16.391 --> 05:17.610
Serena's my girl.

05:17.697 --> 05:19.907
She's the one that
needs a win in life.

05:19.994 --> 05:21.583
Am I right, Doc?

05:22.502 --> 05:23.801
Absolutely.

05:23.931 --> 05:26.349
That's a very healthy
attitude, Rachel.

05:26.487 --> 05:27.541
Thank you.

05:27.723 --> 05:28.978
Yeah.

05:29.310 --> 05:31.118
It's amazing what can
happen to a woman

05:31.205 --> 05:33.678
when you put a camera on her 24/7.

05:35.041 --> 05:36.493
Right, Doc?

05:37.306 --> 05:39.109
Yeah.

05:41.455 --> 05:43.233
All right! Let's go, troops!

05:43.320 --> 05:45.429
Let's invade Connecticut!
Everybody out!

05:45.516 --> 05:47.194
- Quinn, am I...
- Yes! A.D. Dan, you, too!

05:47.281 --> 05:48.756
Everyone out! Out!

05:48.843 --> 05:50.511
Quinn? Can we talk?

05:50.631 --> 05:52.923
Yeah. I think we'd better.

05:55.169 --> 05:57.718
Hey. Look, I just want to
apologize again.

05:57.805 --> 06:00.404
- It's all right.
- I'm not talking to you.

06:00.734 --> 06:02.603
Look, I never would've
hooked up with Alexi

06:02.690 --> 06:04.051
if I knew you two had a thing.

06:04.138 --> 06:05.674
Yes, you would have.

06:06.008 --> 06:07.889
It's who you are, Rachel.
It's why you do so well here.

06:07.976 --> 06:09.491
Jay, please, stop, seriously?

06:09.578 --> 06:10.968
You keep just, like, yelling at me

06:11.055 --> 06:12.593
and telling me
what a piece of shit I am.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.362
Well, then stop acting like
a piece if shit.

06:14.449 --> 06:15.663
I'm trying to.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.698
I'm actually about to
make some pretty big changes.

06:17.785 --> 06:21.097
Oh, what? A threesome
with Owen and Jasper?

06:21.655 --> 06:23.949
Look, I'm just trying
to pick up the pieces.

06:24.266 --> 06:25.840
I'm making amends, okay?

06:25.927 --> 06:26.980
Whatever.

06:27.067 --> 06:28.784
Look, you just do you.

06:31.305 --> 06:33.694
Look, I'm trying to protect Rachel.

06:33.781 --> 06:35.439
Either way, still fired.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.507
You know, I wondered whether
it was you or Jeremy.

06:38.594 --> 06:39.577
It's such a low bar.

06:39.664 --> 06:41.670
I'm gonna tell her the truth,
all right? I'm gonna come clean...

06:41.757 --> 06:42.905
No, you're not.

06:42.992 --> 06:44.890
You mention one word to Rachel,

06:44.977 --> 06:47.328
I am gonna call the board
and get your license revoked.

06:47.415 --> 06:50.421
Call the boar... She's had
one breakthrough after another!

06:50.508 --> 06:52.085
She's cut ties with her mother,

06:52.172 --> 06:54.101
confronted her past...
I got her there!

06:54.188 --> 06:55.726
No, she got herself there.

06:55.813 --> 06:58.054
Do you know what I
saw on that camera?

06:58.141 --> 06:59.440
Every time you pushed her,

06:59.527 --> 07:03.046
every time she created
some bullshit show for you,

07:03.133 --> 07:04.534
she crumbled.

07:05.086 --> 07:07.003
She cried herself to sleep.

07:07.090 --> 07:08.154
What?

07:08.242 --> 07:10.538
She knows this is not right.

07:10.625 --> 07:13.456
This isn't what she wants.
She can't help herself.

07:13.614 --> 07:15.690
And that's just the
way you like it.

07:15.777 --> 07:17.391
You want to fire me, fine.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.508
Hear this.

07:18.719 --> 07:20.564
There's no version of this job

07:20.651 --> 07:24.784
or any relationship with you that'll
be healthy for Rachel, ever.

07:31.892 --> 07:33.320
Wait!

07:33.554 --> 07:34.971
Miss King!

07:35.211 --> 07:37.296
I told you she's not available.

07:37.383 --> 07:40.533
- You can't just barge in here.
- Yeah, well, she looks pretty available to me.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.919
It's okay, Ellen.
Give us five minutes.

07:43.006 --> 07:45.584
Ooh, wow! Five minutes.

07:45.671 --> 07:47.376
Super-generous.

07:47.555 --> 07:49.513
Nice digs you got here.

07:49.688 --> 07:52.052
And all you had to do was
sell your soul to get 'em.

07:52.274 --> 07:54.202
Gary made me an offer
I couldn't refuse.

07:54.289 --> 07:56.777
You could've, but you didn't.

07:56.914 --> 07:59.949
Listen, I did a little digging
on your new partner.

08:00.328 --> 08:02.104
Here you go.

08:02.641 --> 08:06.943
Every unethical, immoral,
illegal move he's ever made.

08:07.789 --> 08:09.429
Why would you give this to me?

08:09.516 --> 08:13.077
Look, Gary is
a pussy-grabbing slime ball

08:13.164 --> 08:14.927
who will not empower you.

08:15.014 --> 08:16.630
And I know you, Fiona.

08:16.717 --> 08:20.337
You are not built to be number
two to some mediocre white dude.

08:20.424 --> 08:21.508
Quinn...

08:21.595 --> 08:22.859
Come on.

08:23.035 --> 08:27.127
You and me,
we can take Gary down together.

08:27.313 --> 08:28.848
You can be number one.

08:28.935 --> 08:30.753
I can do that for you.

08:31.188 --> 08:32.649
So, take a look at that

08:32.736 --> 08:35.534
and let me know what you think.

08:41.590 --> 08:42.780
Hey, guys.

08:42.885 --> 08:44.633
Say goodbye to the mansion.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.871
You gonna miss this place?

08:45.958 --> 08:47.546
Like London misses the plague.

08:47.633 --> 08:49.376
Hey, bud, you might
be back next season.

08:49.463 --> 08:50.745
You'll still be single.

08:50.832 --> 08:52.425
Thank you, Daniel. Let's go.

08:52.512 --> 08:54.101
- Just Dan.
- Thanks, Danica.

08:54.188 --> 08:55.917
Bye, you guys!

09:01.729 --> 09:03.399
Hey.

09:04.101 --> 09:05.409
How you doing?

09:05.536 --> 09:06.641
I'm good.

09:06.968 --> 09:08.211
I am.

09:08.931 --> 09:10.611
I think mostly 'cause I'm leaving.

09:10.698 --> 09:12.293
Like, for real this time, though.

09:12.380 --> 09:13.527
I'm done, Rach.

09:13.614 --> 09:15.129
I... I have to be.

09:15.216 --> 09:16.652
Yeah, me, too.

09:16.884 --> 09:18.102
Yeah?

09:29.594 --> 09:32.402
Hey. Uh, sticks go in the truck.

09:40.383 --> 09:41.800
You got a sec?

09:42.049 --> 09:43.253
Everything okay?

09:43.340 --> 09:45.035
Um, everything's great.

09:45.122 --> 09:48.558
I just wanted to tell you
that, um, I'm leaving.

09:48.692 --> 09:52.516
I'm gonna take a job with Serena
at her company.

09:53.524 --> 09:54.541
Really?

09:54.628 --> 09:58.371
So, uh, the contestant is your BFF?

09:59.633 --> 10:02.410
You girls are gonna go off
and save the world together?

10:02.497 --> 10:03.789
Maybe.

10:04.196 --> 10:05.752
Why not?

10:05.839 --> 10:08.277
Well, because in the real world,

10:09.304 --> 10:11.485
Serena's not gonna
stick her neck out

10:11.572 --> 10:13.493
for her reality TV buddy

10:13.580 --> 10:17.464
with her Tesla-driving,
Ivy-league-asshole friends.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.308
Yeah, well, see,
Serena's a really good person.

10:20.664 --> 10:22.530
It's been awhile
since I've met one of those.

10:22.617 --> 10:25.058
She's a shiny penny. I get it.

10:25.259 --> 10:26.902
But that's not who we are.

10:27.074 --> 10:28.175
We?

10:28.262 --> 10:30.316
I mean, this is a
job for me, Quinn.

10:30.411 --> 10:34.254
It's a job that was a huge mistake.
She's offering me a career.

10:35.626 --> 10:37.589
I'm, like, dying here.

10:37.771 --> 10:41.214
I mean, this place is just killing
me. You have to know that.

10:44.259 --> 10:46.066
Just let me get out.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.584
Fine.

10:55.495 --> 10:56.818
Quinn, you can't buy me.

10:56.905 --> 10:58.823
No, I'm not buying anything.

10:58.973 --> 11:01.621
This is yours, free and clear.

11:02.094 --> 11:04.019
It's the money you gave your dad.

11:04.357 --> 11:05.918
50k, right?

11:07.095 --> 11:09.222
You don't want to go
to Silicon Valley.

11:09.414 --> 11:13.285
I saw your face at that
poop-fest goat farm and...

11:15.258 --> 11:17.504
it's the happiest you've ever been.

11:18.059 --> 11:22.379
So you go and you get your cabin

11:24.454 --> 11:26.199
and you get out...

11:27.845 --> 11:29.332
all the way out.

11:40.127 --> 11:43.707
And you... and you're
doing this again.

11:43.844 --> 11:44.851
Doing what?

11:44.938 --> 11:46.580
No, you're trying to
make me believe, like,

11:46.667 --> 11:49.523
you're the only person in the
entire world who cares about me

11:49.610 --> 11:52.231
so I stay here and make you rich
while I'm dying on the inside.

11:52.318 --> 11:54.522
This is exactly
the kind of mind-game shit.

11:54.609 --> 11:56.824
Dr. Simon was talking about.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.379
Oh. Dr. Simon?

12:01.297 --> 12:03.070
Because he's so
honest and up front?

12:03.157 --> 12:05.585
Well, at least he's making me
realize what I need,

12:05.672 --> 12:08.055
- which is to stay away from you.
- Right.

12:08.142 --> 12:11.769
'Cause I'm the Wicked Witch and
he's the Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

12:11.861 --> 12:16.683
Well, spoiler alert...
the Wizard's a fraud.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.730
No, he's not.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.482
You're just jealous that
I trust him more than you.

12:21.569 --> 12:23.785
Oh, you trust him?

12:25.205 --> 12:29.963
He had a camera hidden
in your truck, Rachel.

12:30.050 --> 12:33.400
He's been watching you 24/7
for God knows how long.

12:33.487 --> 12:35.802
Bullshit. Dude, you're such a liar.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.285
I saw it with my own eyes.

12:37.404 --> 12:38.925
He admitted it.

12:39.193 --> 12:40.645
He is an obsessed,

12:40.732 --> 12:43.390
- weirdo stalker.
- This doesn't even make any sense.

12:43.477 --> 12:45.843
The guy has been nothing but
a complete professional.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.496
A professional creep.

12:48.543 --> 12:49.996
And I fired him.

12:50.776 --> 12:52.566
You're welcome.

12:55.057 --> 12:56.552
- Rachel?
- No, I'm gonna go get

12:56.639 --> 12:59.574
Serena her husband
and then after that, we're done.

13:06.171 --> 13:07.929
Now, on "Everlasting,"

13:08.016 --> 13:11.700
we invite you to a bucolic,
quaint part of the United States

13:11.787 --> 13:14.004
we call Connecticut,

13:14.325 --> 13:16.089
the Constitution state.

13:16.211 --> 13:19.355
Home to the American robin,
Yale University,

13:19.469 --> 13:21.425
<i>and a whole lot of white bread.</i>

13:21.633 --> 13:23.545
<i>But more importantl, it's the state</i>

13:23.632 --> 13:25.816
<i>that gave us Serena Wolcott.</i>

13:25.903 --> 13:27.144
<i>Serena, darling.</i>

13:27.231 --> 13:28.231
<i>Mom. Hi.</i>

13:28.318 --> 13:29.863
Hi.

13:31.128 --> 13:32.623
I want you to meet Owen.

13:32.710 --> 13:33.887
- Such a pleasure. Hi.
- Hi.

13:35.027 --> 13:36.149
And this is Riley.

13:36.236 --> 13:38.868
Ah. Riley's a little shy
around new people.

13:39.183 --> 13:40.441
Mom, what's going on? Where's Dad?

13:40.528 --> 13:42.558
He won't come out of his room.
You know how he gets.

13:42.645 --> 13:44.477
<i>This is ridiculous.
He won't even come out here?</i>

13:44.564 --> 13:46.517
'Cause he's jerking off
to his tax returns.

13:46.604 --> 13:47.804
I mean, look at this place.

13:47.891 --> 13:49.172
You know, I'm gonna go talk to him.

13:49.259 --> 13:50.701
No, why don't you let Owen do it?

13:50.788 --> 13:52.564
Rachel's right.
You think I didn't realize

13:52.651 --> 13:55.343
I'd be a tough sell to a family
that lives in a place like this?

13:55.486 --> 13:57.351
I don't care what my dad thinks.

13:57.793 --> 13:58.949
But I do.

13:59.303 --> 14:01.436
This is his moment.
Let him have it.

14:03.607 --> 14:05.327
Okay. Okay.

14:07.332 --> 14:08.439
Mr. Wolcott?

14:08.526 --> 14:09.838
Nobody was supposed to be
in here.

14:09.925 --> 14:12.041
I just, uh, wanted to
introduce you to Owen.

14:12.128 --> 14:13.292
He would like to speak with you.

14:13.379 --> 14:15.260
You're gonna need to
take that cameraman with you.

14:15.347 --> 14:16.456
Actually, Mr. Wolcott,

14:16.543 --> 14:18.863
the only way they're gonna let
us talk is if the camera stays.

14:18.950 --> 14:23.156
Plus, we're paying you $10,000
a day to shoot here, old man.

14:23.386 --> 14:25.252
<i>All I ask is that you hear me out.</i>

14:27.160 --> 14:30.174
<i>I know that I'm probably not
the kind of person</i>

14:30.261 --> 14:31.870
you expected your daughter
to end up with.

14:31.957 --> 14:34.682
Son, I don't know you from Adam.

14:34.769 --> 14:36.871
What I do know is
you're on a reality show

14:36.958 --> 14:43.335
and that's not... how I saw
my daughter meeting a husband.

14:45.081 --> 14:46.428
You're right.

14:46.543 --> 14:49.505
I mean, the...
the whole thing is absurd.

14:49.573 --> 14:51.874
We... we got cameras on us 24/7,

14:52.074 --> 14:54.292
20 other men trying to
get a date with Serena.

14:54.379 --> 14:57.221
If we can survive that,
we can survive anything.

14:57.308 --> 14:58.487
<i>I love your daughter.</i>

14:58.847 --> 15:00.030
<i>That's real.</i>

15:00.121 --> 15:03.108
<i>Nice work, Rachel. Owen's in.</i>

15:03.683 --> 15:05.307
<i>I was the only oe of my friends</i>

15:05.394 --> 15:07.600
<i>who did not buy his
wy out of the draft,</i>

15:07.808 --> 15:08.934
Hey. Hey.

15:09.021 --> 15:10.987
I had to come check.
How's it going?

15:11.074 --> 15:13.284
- Oh, it's a disaster, isn't it?
- Oh, uh, no.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.452
Actually, no, it's not.
Everything's, uh, going great.

15:25.027 --> 15:26.363
Yeah.

15:29.613 --> 15:31.299
- Hello, again.
- Hi.

15:31.386 --> 15:32.854
- One more.
- Got it.

15:33.746 --> 15:36.389
Ugh. All right, here we go.

15:36.476 --> 15:38.269
Hi. So?

15:39.683 --> 15:41.678
What do you think?

15:48.996 --> 15:50.166
Great.

15:50.253 --> 15:52.183
Did you see those floating
terraces in the pool?

15:52.277 --> 15:54.607
Huh? Well, take a picture of
'em. I'll buy you a couple.

15:54.694 --> 15:57.518
Chet, hope I'm not interrupting
anything mind-numbing?

15:57.605 --> 15:59.151
No, I... I totally understand

15:59.238 --> 16:01.593
that Chetty is here
to produce the show.

16:01.722 --> 16:02.925
Wonderful.

16:03.868 --> 16:05.193
Uh...

16:06.347 --> 16:08.229
Uh, is your plane gassed up?

16:08.316 --> 16:10.252
Why? You're not going
anywhere, are you?

16:10.339 --> 16:11.388
I can't produce this thing

16:11.475 --> 16:12.760
- by myself now.
- Yeah, no shit.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.239
All right, I'm not going anywhere.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.917
I just need a favor.

16:16.011 --> 16:17.797
I've got to load up
some explosives.

16:17.884 --> 16:19.846
Yeah. I got a plane for you.

16:19.933 --> 16:21.567
- I got anything you need.
- Okay.

16:21.654 --> 16:24.009
So you flew across the country
just to talk to me?

16:24.107 --> 16:26.196
Oh, my God, Quinn was right.
You're obsessed.

16:26.283 --> 16:28.286
Rachel, I am so, so sorry.

16:28.373 --> 16:29.692
What is wrong with you?

16:29.779 --> 16:31.911
- You're such a perv.
- Look, I know I crossed a line,

16:31.998 --> 16:33.817
but it wasn't for
some twisted reason.

16:33.904 --> 16:36.208
I was genuinely concerned
you would hurt yourself.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.110
Except you are the only one
that's hurt me.

16:38.197 --> 16:40.001
Hurting you is the last thing
I want to do.

16:40.138 --> 16:41.931
Okay, le...

16:44.217 --> 16:46.612
You know what, screw it.
I'm glad Quinn fired me.

16:46.699 --> 16:48.714
- Mm-hmm?
- Yeah, because

16:48.916 --> 16:50.807
now I can speak freely.

16:51.528 --> 16:52.950
What's that mean?

16:53.076 --> 16:55.360
Look, I know this sounds crazy,

16:55.447 --> 16:58.630
but I've gotten to know you
so well in our time together

16:58.717 --> 17:00.366
and you've really touched my heart

17:00.453 --> 17:03.427
in a way no other patient has.

17:05.131 --> 17:06.356
In a way...

17:06.443 --> 17:08.454
no other woman has.

17:08.701 --> 17:10.842
No. Mnh-mnh. Dude, no.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.010
- Rachel.
- No.

17:12.097 --> 17:13.638
- I know you feel it.
- Mnh-mnh.

17:13.726 --> 17:15.394
You came to me the other night,

17:15.481 --> 17:17.364
but it... it wasn't the right time.

17:17.451 --> 17:18.797
- Okay, it was inappropriate then.
- And what,

17:18.865 --> 17:20.395
- But now I'm fired...
- this is appropriate? This is sick.

17:20.482 --> 17:21.747
Look, the show's almost over,

17:21.834 --> 17:23.848
and it makes sense for
us to be together.

17:23.935 --> 17:26.023
We can be open and honest

17:26.111 --> 17:28.587
in a way you could never be
with any other man.

17:28.674 --> 17:32.230
After what you told me,
what you got Jeremy to do,

17:32.317 --> 17:33.911
killing those two people...

17:33.998 --> 17:35.942
that secret will always be
a weight inside you.

17:36.029 --> 17:38.388
You know that. That's what
Essential Honesty is about.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.038
Just stop, dude. Stop.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.201
You think Serena's gonna
understand what you did?

17:42.288 --> 17:45.400
No one would accept you
if they knew, but I do.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.821
I know everything about you.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.091
And I love you, Rachel.

17:51.178 --> 17:54.345
My God. Ugh. My God.
Dude, you're crazy.

17:54.434 --> 17:55.739
- You are crazy.
- I'm not...

17:55.826 --> 17:57.159
You're... you're insane.

17:57.246 --> 17:58.456
Just get away from me.
Get...

17:58.543 --> 18:01.056
- Rachel just...
- get out of here. Okay, can you go?

18:03.173 --> 18:04.818
Go, honestly.

18:04.997 --> 18:06.308
Okay.

18:10.536 --> 18:12.853
Oh, my... Crazy.

18:19.529 --> 18:23.400
Two roads diverged
in a Connecticut wood.

18:23.764 --> 18:25.603
Which will Serena choose?

18:25.710 --> 18:28.286
<i>My personal favorite reason
for coming to Connecticut,</i>

18:28.373 --> 18:31.708
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
look at the grounds, the home.</i>

18:31.795 --> 18:35.160
<i>People come here from all ovr
the world for summer vacation.</i>

18:35.247 --> 18:37.735
<i>Tea, gentlemen's parties.</i>

18:37.822 --> 18:41.649
<i>I'd love to go there myself,
but I could never afford it.</i>

18:58.309 --> 19:00.419
<i>One of the most beautiful
landscapes outside of,</i>

19:00.506 --> 19:02.910
<i>oh, I don't know, Costa Rica.</i>

19:03.279 --> 19:06.064
The question now is,
can Jasper's parents

19:06.151 --> 19:09.127
help him seal the deal
with Serena's family?

19:09.214 --> 19:11.876
The answer... moments away.

19:12.021 --> 19:15.075
I've never seen
such a magnificent rhododendron.

19:15.162 --> 19:16.927
<i>Trust me, we've seen a lot.</i>

19:17.014 --> 19:19.946
Uh, hello? Has anybody seen Rachel?

19:29.207 --> 19:30.642
Hi, Rachel.

19:31.042 --> 19:32.651
What are you doing here, Madison?

19:32.738 --> 19:34.092
Yeah, Quinn called.

19:34.179 --> 19:36.307
I guess she figured out
that she'd made a mistake.

19:36.375 --> 19:37.836
She needs me more than she thought.

19:37.904 --> 19:39.594
We've gotten pretty close this
season, you know.

19:39.662 --> 19:40.962
 She's grooming me.

19:41.030 --> 19:43.657
Not that you should
feel threatened or anything.

19:48.393 --> 19:49.974
What's wrong with you?

19:50.061 --> 19:52.404
<i>So, what's this I hear about a bet?</i>

19:52.491 --> 19:54.645
Ooh. She knows about the bet.

19:54.732 --> 19:58.173
<i>Well, thankfully, Serea
realized that it was a...</i>

19:58.279 --> 20:01.386
<i>a foolish, idiotic prak
and she forgave me.</i>

20:01.473 --> 20:04.049
I mean, everything really is
better with an accent, isn't it?

20:04.136 --> 20:05.423
Hell yeah.

20:05.623 --> 20:07.352
<i>I would do anythig to keep her.</i>

20:07.439 --> 20:11.162
<i>Even if that means staying n
a hideous reality show</i>

20:11.249 --> 20:12.977
<i>far longer than I ever intende.</i>

20:13.064 --> 20:14.411
I should get an accent.

20:14.498 --> 20:16.806
- <i>Ach du lieber!</i>
- There you go.

20:17.278 --> 20:19.739
Oh. All right, it's all you, champ.

20:19.826 --> 20:21.870
- Got to go.
- Where are you going?

20:22.085 --> 20:23.294
It's showtime.

20:23.381 --> 20:24.603
<i>Can I get you another drink?</i>

20:24.690 --> 20:26.411
<i>So you've heard.</i>

20:26.498 --> 20:28.864
Madison! Are you coming in?

20:31.236 --> 20:33.681
So, I guess I owe you an apology.

20:34.131 --> 20:35.295
Yes.

20:35.912 --> 20:37.098
You just got it.

20:37.185 --> 20:38.241
- Now, let's go.
- Okay.

20:38.328 --> 20:39.900
Let's do this.

20:41.475 --> 20:43.177
Congratulations.

20:43.318 --> 20:45.357
You're shooting
the elimination ceremony.

20:45.444 --> 20:48.591
What?
No, the finale is Quinn's baby.

20:48.678 --> 20:51.897
I know. She thinks you have
an amazing eye, and she's right.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.868
You know? You're crazy-talented.

20:54.334 --> 20:58.173
That's why I've recommend you
for the DP job next season.

20:59.725 --> 21:01.476
Where are you going?

21:02.092 --> 21:04.112
I'm quitting.

21:05.092 --> 21:06.153
Why?

21:06.240 --> 21:09.317
I've wanted to so many times
this season.

21:09.459 --> 21:12.931
And the only reason I haven't
is because of you.

21:13.244 --> 21:15.543
I just can't be here anymore.

21:16.060 --> 21:18.259
If you can't be with
Rachel, you mean?

21:19.006 --> 21:20.995
- Uh...
- I saw you two together.

21:21.545 --> 21:22.677
It's obvious.

21:22.764 --> 21:24.766
You don't understand, Charlie.

21:25.053 --> 21:26.603
I've done things.

21:27.060 --> 21:31.743
I have a darkness inside of me
that you don't know

21:31.943 --> 21:33.798
and you don't want to know.

21:34.045 --> 21:35.939
I'm doing you a favor.

21:39.318 --> 21:40.498
Fine.

21:40.646 --> 21:42.415
Get out of here, then.

21:43.408 --> 21:45.708
Take your darkness and go.

21:54.334 --> 21:55.884
Hello, Gary.

21:56.739 --> 21:58.363
Margot,
so glad you could make it.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.238
I do love a good ending

22:00.325 --> 22:02.740
and no matter how many seasons
you do this,

22:02.827 --> 22:04.272
you never know who's gonna win

22:04.365 --> 22:06.705
and who's gonna go home
bitter and alone.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.896
Mm. Well, get ready.

22:09.139 --> 22:10.775
It's gonna be a real nail-biter.

22:10.862 --> 22:12.301
- Mm.
- Come on.

22:13.448 --> 22:15.419
Hey, you.

22:15.670 --> 22:17.882
Hi. Nice to see you again.

22:17.969 --> 22:19.257
I'm Madison.

22:19.344 --> 22:21.946
- Hi.
- This is Margot, my wife.

22:22.326 --> 22:24.452
You never told me you were married.

22:24.787 --> 22:27.946
Gary is so professional.
He never talks about his family.

22:28.033 --> 22:29.864
Just gets right down to business.

22:29.990 --> 22:32.642
I'm gonna get a drink.

22:39.664 --> 22:41.495
Are you happy now? He's all yours.

22:41.631 --> 22:43.214
I don't know what
you're talking about

22:43.301 --> 22:45.724
- and honestly, I don't care.
- Jeremy's obsessed with you.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.002
And he always will be.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.515
Lord knows why.
You're a manipulative bitch

22:50.602 --> 22:53.540
who gets joy out of
hurting good, decent people.

22:54.365 --> 22:56.431
Least someone's getting
what they want.

23:01.449 --> 23:03.798
I'm gonna give you
that, but I mean...

23:04.536 --> 23:05.770
What was that?

23:05.857 --> 23:08.708
Hmm? Some pathetic attempt
to embarrass me

23:08.795 --> 23:09.981
in front of my wife, really?

23:10.068 --> 23:12.243
Mm. Give me a little credit, Gary.

23:12.330 --> 23:13.581
I would never count on

23:13.668 --> 23:16.193
one woman's accusations
of sexual depravity

23:16.280 --> 23:17.676
to bring you down.

23:17.763 --> 23:21.673
So I played it safe
and I brought along 11.

23:26.244 --> 23:27.541
Congratulations.

23:27.654 --> 23:29.223
You are now the lucky defendant

23:29.310 --> 23:32.368
in a class-action sexual
harassment lawsuit.

23:32.556 --> 23:34.248
- So trendy.
- But...

23:34.490 --> 23:37.673
Sorry, Gary, but you know
the rule around here.

23:37.810 --> 23:40.114
Sluts get cut.

23:48.857 --> 23:50.600
Hey, um,

23:51.704 --> 23:54.407
did you break up with Charlie
because of,

23:55.084 --> 23:57.815
you know, like what we did, because
you could never really tell her?

23:57.928 --> 24:01.402
I just... I don't to hurt anyone
anymore, Rach.

24:01.489 --> 24:03.696
No, I get it. Yeah, I know.

24:05.411 --> 24:09.199
What is gonna happen to us when
we go out in the real world, huh?

24:10.865 --> 24:12.533
Guess we just pretend.

24:12.639 --> 24:17.103
I don't know. I guess we owe it
to ourselves to find out.

24:17.951 --> 24:19.627
At least try.

24:20.154 --> 24:21.944
Together, right?

24:22.068 --> 24:23.860
I'm damaged, you're damaged.

24:24.514 --> 24:26.743
Let's just
go be damaged together.

24:26.834 --> 24:28.653
- You don't understand.
- No, I... I don't...

24:28.740 --> 24:30.618
I don't want to be
with you anymore.

24:32.771 --> 24:35.353
- Jeremy, I... I...
- No. No, I...

24:35.788 --> 24:37.579
You're this...

24:38.982 --> 24:41.829
you're a stain that I...

24:42.086 --> 24:44.396
I have to live with
for the rest of my life.

24:44.483 --> 24:48.103
I'd rather be alone forever
than be with you.

24:49.709 --> 24:52.174
And I think you're gonna
be alone forever, too.

24:52.373 --> 24:55.595
And honestly, I think
that's best for everyone.

24:57.467 --> 25:00.376
<i>Rachel, where are you?
Serena needs to be prepped.</i>

25:00.611 --> 25:02.610
<i>Who's gonna win this thing?</i>

25:03.184 --> 25:04.900
Yeah, I got it.

25:05.537 --> 25:07.368
Trust me, I'm all over it.

25:14.485 --> 25:16.446
Oh, my God.

25:16.721 --> 25:18.267
You look so pretty.

25:18.420 --> 25:19.552
- Aw.
- How do you feel?

25:19.639 --> 25:21.833
I feel amazing. I've
made my choice.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.442
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

25:23.529 --> 25:25.470
Yeah. I mean, I realized
that you're... you're so right.

25:25.557 --> 25:28.359
I've been obsessed with
finding the perfect guy,

25:28.446 --> 25:31.212
but I... I think that was just
my fear talking.

25:31.850 --> 25:34.210
I'm really, truly happy.

25:35.537 --> 25:36.951
Okay.

25:38.264 --> 25:39.692
Why aren't you happy about this?

25:39.779 --> 25:41.589
Huh? No, I am.

25:41.912 --> 25:43.396
I am.

25:45.740 --> 25:48.282
I just saw you today
and you seemed...

25:49.466 --> 25:51.353
I seemed...?

25:53.006 --> 25:55.626
You know, honestly, it's, like,
nothing. Forget it, please?

25:55.863 --> 25:58.189
Will you please just tell me
who you're choosing?

25:58.276 --> 25:59.504
I'm, like, dying to know.

25:59.591 --> 26:00.629
- Okay, Rachel?
- Hmm?

26:00.716 --> 26:02.941
We have been in this together
from the beginning,

26:03.028 --> 26:04.692
so you can't go silent on me now.

26:04.779 --> 26:06.037
Come on.

26:07.904 --> 26:11.110
Okay, fine, but look, this could
just be me, but it...

26:12.100 --> 26:14.946
it doesn't really seem like
you're feeling it

26:15.475 --> 26:17.595
with either of these guys.

26:18.389 --> 26:19.723
I mean, are you?

26:19.810 --> 26:21.137
What are you talking about?

26:21.623 --> 26:23.216
Please, just tell
me that I'm wrong.

26:23.303 --> 26:25.786
Please, just tell me that
you are like 100% sure,

26:25.873 --> 26:29.556
that you do not have this gnawing
feeling in the pit of your stomach.

26:31.092 --> 26:32.760
Okay, maybe I have butterflies,

26:32.896 --> 26:35.668
but that's normal when anyone's
making a big decision.

26:35.755 --> 26:37.195
Right, I just don't
want you to be worried

26:37.282 --> 26:39.181
that Owen is from this
completely different world

26:39.268 --> 26:41.117
or that Jasper has got
this deep insecurity

26:41.204 --> 26:42.534
underneath all of that snobbiness.

26:42.621 --> 26:45.559
I'm trying not to, because you
said that everybody's flawed

26:45.646 --> 26:47.895
and I can't just Google up
the perfect person.

26:47.982 --> 26:49.570
I mean, that made a
lot of sense to me.

26:50.896 --> 26:53.013
I know. I know. I...

26:53.100 --> 26:55.060
Look, I've just had to do this
like a million times.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.270
You know, like, push the suitor
into making a choice

26:57.357 --> 26:59.600
that's good for the
show and I just...

27:00.310 --> 27:02.970
I really don't want
to do that with you.

27:03.732 --> 27:05.345
You matter to me.

27:06.420 --> 27:09.398
Please, just tell me
that this is what you want.

27:10.975 --> 27:12.349
It is.

27:12.678 --> 27:13.749
- Okay.
- It is.

27:13.836 --> 27:15.053
Okay.

27:15.486 --> 27:17.284
I mean, if you're
sure, then I'm sure.

27:17.408 --> 27:19.317
Let's just forget about
those butterflies

27:19.404 --> 27:22.690
and let's go out there
and let's choose your soul mate.

27:22.990 --> 27:24.905
We have to.

27:32.451 --> 27:36.564
Welcome, fellow romantics
and lovers of love,

27:36.670 --> 27:39.987
to "Everlasting's" live finale,

27:40.185 --> 27:43.535
where a brave single dad
will face a Wall Street wolf.

27:43.622 --> 27:46.777
That is so beautiful.
It's so romantic.

27:46.864 --> 27:48.843
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

27:49.021 --> 27:51.415
for Owen and Jasper!

27:53.068 --> 27:57.404
Hey, I know that I'm a softy,
but Chetty and I are next.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.856
Fingers crossed, huh?

27:58.943 --> 28:00.919
Uh-huh. Oh, it's...
it's gonna happen.

28:01.006 --> 28:02.887
And when it does, it's gonna be...

28:02.974 --> 28:05.025
it's gonna be amazing.

28:05.592 --> 28:09.884
And now, the woman of the hour.

28:10.225 --> 28:11.766
You know what?

28:11.904 --> 28:13.437
What?

28:13.524 --> 28:16.243
I have a really good idea.

28:17.725 --> 28:18.789
Mm-hmm.

28:18.889 --> 28:20.708
<i>Our stunning suitress,</i>

28:20.795 --> 28:22.023
Serena!

28:24.139 --> 28:25.443
She looks amazing.

28:25.530 --> 28:26.561
Gorgeous.

28:26.648 --> 28:28.352
Okay, okay.

28:28.439 --> 28:30.918
So who will be
the lucky winner this evening?

28:31.076 --> 28:33.751
And not only of this
beautiful life partner,

28:34.029 --> 28:38.270
but also of a brand-new
Hyundai Santa Fe,

28:38.357 --> 28:40.692
with incredible style
and advanced technology?

28:40.779 --> 28:42.402
Hyundai makes things better.

28:42.615 --> 28:44.035
Really is a very good car.

28:44.122 --> 28:45.944
All right, let's go.
Roll the clips.

28:46.031 --> 28:48.388
<i>Come with me, won't you,
as we take a look back</i>

28:48.475 --> 28:50.540
at the journeys that
brought us here.

28:50.701 --> 28:52.837
<i>Give it up, ladies and
gentlemen, for Owen and Jaspe!</i>

28:52.924 --> 28:55.237
Ugh. I hate this part.

29:01.702 --> 29:03.447
And there they are,

29:03.789 --> 29:08.286
two incredible journeys
to one incredible choice.

29:08.373 --> 29:10.600
<i>Serena, are you ready?</i>

29:10.687 --> 29:12.229
Uh, hold on.

29:12.316 --> 29:14.195
This'll just take a minute.

29:14.781 --> 29:15.873
I'm sorry.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.295
I am so sorry to interrupt.

29:17.382 --> 29:18.416
Oh, my God. Chet?

29:18.503 --> 29:20.186
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

29:20.273 --> 29:21.338
What's happening?

29:21.425 --> 29:23.034
Just... just go with it.
Relax. We're live.

29:23.121 --> 29:25.676
Chetty, you are the love of my life

29:25.763 --> 29:27.475
<i>and I know that I'm
the love of yours.</i>

29:27.703 --> 29:31.292
So I was thinking...
will you marry me?

29:32.637 --> 29:34.018
Chetty?

29:34.304 --> 29:36.937
Go, go marry your child bride.

29:37.062 --> 29:39.436
I know that Graham's
an ordained minister,

29:39.523 --> 29:42.065
so we can do it right
here, right now,

29:42.187 --> 29:44.084
on the set of this amazing show

29:44.171 --> 29:45.866
<i>that has come from
your beautiful heart.</i>

29:45.953 --> 29:46.934
- Chet?
- Oh, come on,

29:47.021 --> 29:47.965
you can't just sit there.

29:48.052 --> 29:50.010
The cameras are rolling.
We're live, Chet.

29:50.109 --> 29:51.257
Quinny...

29:51.968 --> 29:53.037
It's okay.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.237
It's good TV. Go.

29:56.031 --> 29:58.823
Come on, let's hear it for Chet.
Come on out, Chet.

29:59.015 --> 30:01.973
The executive producer of
"Everlasting," everyone.

30:02.060 --> 30:03.241
This is amazing!

30:03.328 --> 30:06.460
Live love, right before our eyes!

30:09.573 --> 30:10.921
This is ridiculous.

30:11.008 --> 30:12.741
I think it's real, dude.

30:12.828 --> 30:14.722
What are we waiting for, right?

30:14.890 --> 30:16.870
This is what we both want.

30:17.242 --> 30:19.345
- We are gathered here today...
- Uh, no.

30:19.432 --> 30:20.598
- Chetty?
- No?

30:20.685 --> 30:23.089
Uh, no, no, no.

30:23.226 --> 30:24.709
I can't do this.

30:24.796 --> 30:26.033
I don't want this.

30:26.186 --> 30:27.491
I just can't.

30:27.578 --> 30:28.998
Why not?

30:30.765 --> 30:32.393
Well, I'm in love
with someone else.

30:33.195 --> 30:34.778
Oh, shit.

30:35.562 --> 30:37.344
<i>Even though she doesn't love me,</i>

30:37.507 --> 30:41.135
<i>she doesn't want to be with me,</i>

30:41.304 --> 30:43.448
<i>I'll never settle
for anything else.</i>

30:43.535 --> 30:45.406
Who are you in love with?

30:45.679 --> 30:48.312
Don't say it, don't say it,
don't say it.

30:48.617 --> 30:49.994
Quinn.

30:50.453 --> 30:52.479
I love Quinn King.

30:53.304 --> 30:54.846
<i>And I always will.</i>

30:55.039 --> 30:57.064
Who's Quinn?

30:57.250 --> 30:58.695
Quinn?

30:59.609 --> 31:01.717
But she's old

31:01.804 --> 31:04.170
and she can't have babies
and she hates you!

31:04.257 --> 31:05.453
I know.

31:06.156 --> 31:07.706
<i>What?!</i>

31:10.234 --> 31:12.569
Hey! Get the camera off of me!

31:12.656 --> 31:13.651
Go away, now!

31:13.738 --> 31:15.850
<i>Okay, let's, uh...
let's get you home.</i>

31:15.937 --> 31:18.881
But I did everything right.
I treated you like a king.

31:18.968 --> 31:22.967
I sucked your old, shriveled
man balls for like five months!

31:23.054 --> 31:24.335
Okay.

31:24.582 --> 31:25.873
What, for nothing?!

31:25.960 --> 31:27.772
- Chet, look at these tits!
- Hey!

31:27.859 --> 31:30.714
You think you're ever gonna see
tits like these again?!

31:31.054 --> 31:32.748
Good luck to you, mister!

31:32.835 --> 31:34.632
Okay, good luck to you. Good luck.

31:34.719 --> 31:36.620
You're such an asshole!

31:36.707 --> 31:38.504
<i>Get off me!
Get off me!</i>

31:41.242 --> 31:42.507
So, Graham, let's, uh,

31:42.594 --> 31:45.243
<i>see who's, uh, gona
get that Hyundai.</i>

31:45.330 --> 31:47.918
<i>Right. Yes. Well, um...</i>

31:48.005 --> 31:49.853
what an exciting...

31:49.940 --> 31:52.706
- Ow. I'm all right.
- Almost-wedding that was.

31:52.796 --> 31:55.366
<i>But we still have our main event.</i>

31:55.453 --> 31:58.038
You see, our suitress
has still not announced

31:58.125 --> 32:01.260
the most important decision
she will ever make.

32:01.492 --> 32:02.983
No pressure, Serena.

32:03.125 --> 32:05.085
<i>Sorry, I'm still trying to
process what that was.</i>

32:05.172 --> 32:07.073
- To say the least.
- So are we all.

32:07.382 --> 32:10.337
Serena, this whole
thing has been nuts.

32:10.565 --> 32:12.787
But when it's us together,

32:12.956 --> 32:15.810
just you and me, it's perfect.

32:16.026 --> 32:18.152
Oh, look at that!

32:19.104 --> 32:20.350
Marry me.

32:20.589 --> 32:22.280
Make me the happiest man alive.

32:22.367 --> 32:23.920
Owen, you are...

32:24.253 --> 32:26.887
<i>you are such a good man.</i>

32:26.987 --> 32:28.258
Ooh.

32:28.378 --> 32:30.508
- Game over.
- That's not a good sign.

32:30.595 --> 32:33.791
<i>I mean, there are no words</i> for
how wonderful you've been,

32:33.878 --> 32:36.730
but... I can't marry you.

32:37.315 --> 32:39.079
I'm so sorry.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.359
I'm sorry.

32:45.534 --> 32:46.896
And then there was one.

32:46.987 --> 32:51.486
Serena, uh, since day
one, it's been us.

32:51.573 --> 32:53.275
I mean, we both know it.

32:53.362 --> 32:56.763
He's still a cocky prick,
all the way to the end.

32:58.242 --> 33:01.252
That, well, I really
didn't think was possible

33:01.339 --> 33:05.193
and you've... you've totally
opened up my heart.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.378
Yeah, baby!

33:07.465 --> 33:08.642
Marry me.

33:09.623 --> 33:10.949
Say yes.

33:11.199 --> 33:12.449
Yes!

33:13.369 --> 33:16.555
Jasper, I...
I can see a future with you.

33:18.115 --> 33:21.375
I'm just not 100% sure
it's the one that I want.

33:21.974 --> 33:23.041
Really?

33:23.128 --> 33:24.521
I'm sorry.

33:27.528 --> 33:29.817
- No!
- Where's my happy ending?

33:30.029 --> 33:32.465
Where... where is my
happy ending?! Hello?!

33:32.552 --> 33:34.018
I know, right? Old sad.

33:34.105 --> 33:35.325
Shut up.

33:35.966 --> 33:38.089
I... I have wanted this so much,

33:38.176 --> 33:43.321
but I realize that I have to
wait until I know for sure,

33:43.716 --> 33:46.843
in my soul, that I have found
my perfect match.

33:47.106 --> 33:48.632
And I am so grateful

33:48.759 --> 33:52.491
that I have such a true friend
who helped me understand that.

33:54.238 --> 33:56.112
Wow. Did not see that coming.

33:56.199 --> 33:57.987
But what a great night, right,
ladies and gentlemen?

33:58.074 --> 34:00.132
Huh? What a great night.

34:00.855 --> 34:05.358
<i>Because our suitress has chosen
the greatest love of all.</i>

34:05.445 --> 34:06.432
<i>Herself.</i>

34:06.519 --> 34:08.574
Oh, shut up, Graham.

34:08.933 --> 34:10.274
- Okay. Yes.
- Excuse me.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.737
No, get... I
need cameras on Owen.

34:12.824 --> 34:13.972
I need a camera on Jasper!

34:14.059 --> 34:15.760
Get the parents, get the brat,

34:15.847 --> 34:17.893
get drama, get tears,
get everything!

34:17.980 --> 34:19.538
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

34:20.072 --> 34:21.297
Just quick question.

34:21.384 --> 34:22.933
Is anyone gonna take the car?

34:26.495 --> 34:28.237
Come in!

34:29.378 --> 34:33.619
So... Frank from legal
was a nice tip, eh?

34:33.706 --> 34:35.871
Yep. He told me
exactly who to call.

34:36.152 --> 34:38.503
How does it feel to be number one?

34:38.590 --> 34:41.562
A lot better than number two,
I'll give you that.

34:42.013 --> 34:46.025
Uh, listen, when that
article comes out,

34:46.112 --> 34:48.695
you are going to get a lot of
flack for keeping me around.

34:48.799 --> 34:50.683
I don't know, Quinn.

34:50.822 --> 34:54.021
Nobody's career could survive
an article like this.

34:57.455 --> 35:00.567
13 more women joined the suit.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.537
Gloria Allred loves
you, by the way.

35:02.643 --> 35:03.955
Bet there might be a show in that.

35:04.042 --> 35:06.211
Where is the article about me?

35:06.298 --> 35:07.533
I killed it.

35:07.620 --> 35:10.897
In exchange for an exclusive
on Gary's shit show.

35:12.338 --> 35:13.805
We're gonna do this the right way.

35:13.948 --> 35:15.634
No more patriarchal bullshit.

35:15.721 --> 35:18.736
Sure. But matriarchal bullshit
is still cool, right?

35:18.823 --> 35:20.496
Quinn?

35:20.690 --> 35:23.689
Ah, you remember my
producer Madison?

35:23.776 --> 35:26.244
Miss Berlin, I want to say
how excited I am

35:26.331 --> 35:28.509
to see a woman
as the head of the network.

35:28.596 --> 35:32.439
It means a lot to me, especially
since I'm a content creator myself.

35:32.604 --> 35:33.907
Madison shot a pilot.

35:34.151 --> 35:36.543
Did you see it? "Hashtag Adulting"?

35:36.846 --> 35:38.967
Gary did not understand it.

35:39.799 --> 35:40.964
Oh.

35:41.159 --> 35:43.736
Well, why don't you
pitch it to me in the car

35:43.823 --> 35:45.560
on the way to the airport?

35:46.346 --> 35:47.737
Thank you.

35:49.653 --> 35:51.080
Something like that.

35:51.167 --> 35:52.681
Oh, my God, you guys?

35:52.768 --> 35:55.639
Twitter is literally blowing up.
You have to hear this.

35:55.726 --> 35:58.099
Okay, "'Everlasting'
just got lit, y'all,".

35:58.186 --> 36:02.041
"Serena equals feminist hero,
hashtag, know your worth."

36:02.128 --> 36:04.205
I mean, you're, like,
all anyone is talking about.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.455
You've inspired women everywhere
not to settle,

36:06.542 --> 36:07.963
to wait for their Clooney.

36:08.050 --> 36:09.745
That's not what this is, Rachel.

36:09.832 --> 36:11.026
What? What do you mean?

36:11.113 --> 36:13.195
You produced me to
pick neither guy.

36:13.282 --> 36:17.154
So, what? I'd end up like you,
empty and alone.

36:17.373 --> 36:22.127
No, I... I produced an
empowered, feminist statement...

36:22.307 --> 36:24.228
- Hmm.
- About not being so desperate

36:24.315 --> 36:26.681
to pair up that you, like,
overlook a mountain of flaws

36:26.768 --> 36:28.171
just so you can be done.

36:28.258 --> 36:30.455
Okay. Sure, just the way
that you produced Crystal

36:30.542 --> 36:32.214
to go after the man of her dreams.

36:32.301 --> 36:33.852
Worked out really well for her.

36:33.939 --> 36:35.290
Tell the truth, Rachel.

36:35.377 --> 36:36.685
You don't hate it here.

36:36.772 --> 36:37.839
You love it.

36:37.926 --> 36:39.435
You were smiling.

36:39.628 --> 36:40.987
I saw you.

36:41.316 --> 36:42.529
- Serena...
- No.

36:42.651 --> 36:44.429
You can forget about the job.

36:44.627 --> 36:46.732
I don't want you anywhere near me.

36:46.979 --> 36:50.263
This is exactly where you belong.

36:51.377 --> 36:56.130
Oh. By the way, I made my choice
for me, not you.

36:56.487 --> 37:00.193
I know it must kill you to hear
this, but, uh, I feel great.

37:14.249 --> 37:16.692
So... it's your favorite
kind of finale.

37:16.779 --> 37:18.466
Everybody's a loser.

37:18.553 --> 37:20.638
Rachel, what happened to you?

37:21.073 --> 37:23.565
I remember the girl
who came back here this season,

37:23.652 --> 37:25.812
- and this is not her.
- Maybe it is.

37:25.899 --> 37:28.464
Maybe this is who I've always been.

37:41.159 --> 37:42.865
<i>You have a match.</i>

37:44.161 --> 37:45.584
<i>You have a match.</i>

37:45.776 --> 37:47.589
<i>You have a match. You have a match.</i>

37:47.676 --> 37:49.458
<i>You have a match. You have a match.</i>

37:49.545 --> 37:51.560
<i>You have a match. You have a match.</i>

37:51.647 --> 37:53.629
<i>You have a match. You have a match.</i>

37:53.716 --> 37:55.898
<i>You have a match. You have a match.</i>

37:55.985 --> 37:58.550
<i>You have a match. You have a match.</i>

38:10.772 --> 38:12.834
Another great season, Rach!

38:15.777 --> 38:18.029
Somebody found love today, huh?!

38:38.001 --> 38:39.441
Got to admit, I had my doubts,

38:39.528 --> 38:42.185
but this is actually pretty good.

38:43.541 --> 38:45.126
It's a little hipster.

38:45.213 --> 38:46.448
It's kind of out of
our demo, but...

38:46.535 --> 38:48.295
I can totally work on that.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.157
What... What are you doing?

38:52.260 --> 38:53.604
Pitching.

38:53.817 --> 38:55.646
Do you want me to stop?

38:57.152 --> 38:58.618
Not yet.

39:01.713 --> 39:06.224
So, uh, I guess this is goodbye.

39:07.409 --> 39:08.924
I guess.

39:09.011 --> 39:12.279
But, I mean, we had a pretty
good run, didn't we?

39:15.670 --> 39:17.168
I don't know.

39:17.862 --> 39:19.715
You know, like,
am I delusional in thinking

39:19.802 --> 39:22.354
that I could go
somewhere else and fit?

39:23.073 --> 39:24.322
What?

39:24.409 --> 39:25.921
No, no, no, no.

39:26.008 --> 39:28.930
Okay? You are brilliant.

39:29.017 --> 39:30.131
Full stop.

39:30.260 --> 39:31.930
Any direction you point,

39:32.026 --> 39:34.096
anything you decide to do,

39:34.183 --> 39:36.943
you will explode and shine.

39:37.159 --> 39:40.271
You are a star and you
always have been.

39:40.541 --> 39:45.577
And I have been doing everything
I can to keep you for myself,

39:45.838 --> 39:49.740
because apparently,
I'm a selfish bitch.

39:50.228 --> 39:51.627
Or was.

39:53.971 --> 39:56.418
I don't even, like,
know who I am anymore.

39:56.505 --> 39:58.052
Well, I do.

39:59.010 --> 40:01.490
I know exactly who you are.

40:03.370 --> 40:09.904
