SHE CALLED ME
FROM HER LUNCH BREAK.

07:36.220 --> 07:39.815
DID SHE SOUND UPSET

WITH ACTIVE ROUTES NEAR

08:44.950 --> 08:47.589
I CROSSED AND THEN
CRISS-CROSSED THEM
WITH THE 3 INTERSTATES,

ARE ANY OF THEM

A FEW ARE ABANDONED
OR CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS.

09:07.210 --> 09:08.336
WHY?

09:08.380 --> 09:10.348
BECAUSE THE UNSUB
PASSED UP SECLUDED AREAS

09:10.380 --> 09:12.610
WHERE HE COULD HAVE
DELAYED THE DISCOVERY
OF THE BODIES.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.311
INSTEAD, HE DID THE OPPOSITE.

09:14.350 --> 09:16.170
HE LEFT THEM

09:16.220 --> 09:18.313
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

09:18.350 --> 09:20.716
BECAUSE TRUCK STOPS

09:20.760 --> 09:22.819
THEY MEAN SOMETHING TO HIM.

THE BUSIEST HOURS

09:32.230 --> 09:33.197
ARE BETWEEN 5:00 AND 6 AM.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.891
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT,
THE BODY WAS DISCOVERED

09:35.940 --> 09:38.101
BY A TRUCKER AROUND 3 AM.

09:38.140 --> 09:40.734
SO THIS GUY KNEW THE PATTERN.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.941
WELL, THE EXTERIOR LOCK
WAS BUSTED.

09:42.980 --> 09:46.143

09:47.820 --> 09:49.742
WE KNOW THIS ISN'T FAR

09:49.790 --> 09:52.111
MAYBE THE UNSUB'S

09:52.150 --> 09:55.608
LIKELY HIS ROUTE EITHER
ORIGINATED OR ENDED IN ATLANTA,

09:55.660 --> 09:58.128
WHICH IS ROUGHLY
A 2 1/2 HOUR DRIVE FROM HERE.

09:58.160 --> 10:00.094
SO BEING A TRUCKER,
HE'S USED TO BEING
ON THE ROAD

10:00.130 --> 10:01.688
FOR LONG PERIODS
OF TIME.

10:01.730 --> 10:03.994
EXACTLY. SO 2 1/2 HOURS
INTO HIS ROUTE,

10:04.030 --> 10:06.066
HE'S NOT GONNA STOP
AND TAKE A BREAK.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.830
RIGHT. TRUCKER'S MENTALITY--
GET TO WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.

10:08.870 --> 10:10.906
THAT COULD BE HOW
HE KNEW THE TRAFFIC FLOW.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.829
HE KNEW THAT MOST TRUCKERS
HEADING IN AND OUT OF ATLANTA

10:13.880 --> 10:16.132
WOULD JUST SKIP OVER
THIS STOP.

10:16.180 --> 10:20.139
IT'S STILL HIGH-RISK,
CONSIDERING HE'S STAGING
A BODY IN A PUBLIC PLACE.

10:20.180 --> 10:22.045
HIS COMPULSION
OUTWEIGHS THE RISK.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.980
MAYBE THE THRILL
IS WHAT GETS HIM OFF.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.681

TO HAVE KNOWN THE BODY

A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP.

LONG PERIODS OF TIME

20:43.440 --> 20:44.998
TRAVELING ON THE OPEN ROAD.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.634
WE BELIEVE THAT LOCATING
THIS CASE WILL BE THE KEY
TO FINDING HIM.

21:44.630 --> 21:45.961
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU
COME IN.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.093
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
TAKING YOUR MEDS?

21:48.140 --> 21:49.232
I CALLED THE PHARMACIST.

21:49.270 --> 21:51.909
HE SAID YOU HAVEN'T REFILLED
YOUR PRESCRIPTION IN MONTHS.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.009
I KNOW.

21:53.040 --> 21:54.337
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

21:54.380 --> 21:55.870
THEY WEREN'T WORKING.

21:55.910 --> 21:57.844
THEY'RE THE ONLY THING
THAT WORKS.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.040
CHLOE, PLEASE STOP.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.709
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
THOSE DREAMS AGAIN, ISN'T IT?

22:02.750 --> 22:04.911
MOTHER THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE BEST IF MAYBE
I STOPPED TAKING--

22:04.950 --> 22:07.453
WAIT. SHE TOLD YOU
TO STOP TAKING YOUR PILLS?

22:07.490 --> 22:09.082
AND YOU LISTENED?

22:09.120 --> 22:10.929
OF COURSE I LISTENED.

22:10.960 --> 22:12.621
SHE'S MY MOTHER.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.958
YOU'VE ONLY KNOWN HER
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.992
IT'S NOT HER PLACE, RANDY.

22:18.030 --> 22:20.089
FIRST IT'S YOUR MEDS
AND THEN IT'S YOUR TIME.

22:20.130 --> 22:24.999
YOU'RE NOT OBLIGATED
TO SPEND EVERY WAKING
MOMENT WITH HER.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.837
CAN'T YOU SEE
SHE'S HURTING YOU?

22:26.870 --> 22:27.939
I SAID STOP!

[LAMP SHATTERS]

22:29.040 --> 22:30.678
RANDY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

22:30.710 --> 22:32.803
THIS IS THE SAME WOMAN
THAT ABANDONED YOU.

22:32.850 --> 22:35.978
SHE DID NOT ABANDON ME.

22:36.020 --> 22:38.841
[GASPING] AH! UHH!

22:38.890 --> 22:42.053
I'M STARTING TO THINK
MAYBE MOTHER WAS RIGHT
ABOUT YOU.

22:42.090 --> 22:44.058
[GASPS]

22:50.600 --> 22:52.989
WE KNOW HOW THE SECOND
AND THIRD VICTIM
ARE CONNECTED,

22:53.030 --> 22:56.067
BUT HOW DOES
CLAIRE WESTCHESTER
FIT INTO THE PUZZLE?

22:56.100 --> 22:57.192
WELL, LET'S GO THROUGH IT AGAIN.
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HER?

22:57.240 --> 22:58.559
Morgan: SHE WAS
A SCHOOLTEACHER
FOR CLOSE TO 30 YEARS.

22:58.610 --> 23:01.704
Rossi: NEVER HAD KIDS,
BUT LOVED HER STUDENTS
LIKE THEY WERE HER OWN.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.549
SHE WAS EXTREMELY HANDS-ON,

23:03.580 --> 23:07.004
ESPECIALLY TO THOSE CHILDREN
WHO SHE FELT WERE IN NEED.

23:07.050 --> 23:08.711
KIDS.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.718
KIDS. WAIT A MINUTE.

23:10.750 --> 23:13.048
IF THE UNSUB IS WORKING
OFF A KILL LIST,

23:13.090 --> 23:16.014
IT'S POSSIBLE HE WAS ONE OF
CLAIRE'S FORMER STUDENTS.

23:16.060 --> 23:17.550
THAT COULD BE OUR CONNECTION.

23:17.590 --> 23:19.729
THAT MAKES SENSE.
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING
OFF AT HOME,

23:19.760 --> 23:20.852
SHE WOULD NOTICE
SIGNS OF ABUSE

23:20.900 --> 23:22.549
AND REPORT IT
TO THE AUTHORITIES.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.692
SHE COULD HAVE BEEN
THE CATALYST

23:23.730 --> 23:25.129
FOR GETTING HIM REMOVED
FROM HIS HOME.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.762
BUT BASED ON OUR PROFILE,

23:26.800 --> 23:27.892
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
TOO YOUNG

23:27.940 --> 23:29.896
TO HAVE KNOWN
THE NAMES OF EVERYONE.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.237
NOT TO MENTION CASE FILES
WEREN'T DIGITAL.

23:31.270 --> 23:34.433
HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO GAIN ACCESS TO THAT
INFORMATION TODAY.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.175
SO HOW DOES THIS GUY
KNOW WHO TO TARGET?

23:36.210 --> 23:38.075
MAYBE THE NAMES
WERE FED TO HIM.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.078
WE PROFILED EARLIER THE
POSSIBILITY OF A PARTNER.

23:40.110 --> 23:41.748
THERE COULD BE SOMETHING
TO THAT.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.441
IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THAT PERSON
WOULD NEED TO FEEL

23:43.490 --> 23:46.084
AS WRONGED BY THE VICTIMS
AS THE UNSUB HIMSELF.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.951
GREEN FOR GO.
A PARENT.

23:47.990 --> 23:50.083
GARCIA, WE THINK
THAT THE UNSUB MAY BE
WORKING WITH A PARTNER,

23:50.120 --> 23:51.724
A PARENT OR GUARDIAN.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.591
AND, BABY GIRL,
CHECK SCHOOL RECORDS

23:53.630 --> 23:55.598

IN CLAIRE WESTCHESTER'S CLASS

23:56.800 --> 23:57.926
YEAH. KEEP TALKING.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.029
IT'S POSSIBLE CLAIRE
FILED A COMPLAINT

24:00.070 --> 24:01.628
WITH THE SCHOOL
AGAINST THE PARENT,

24:01.670 --> 24:03.865
WHICH RESULTED IN
THE UNSUB BEING REMOVED
FROM HIS HOME.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.537
AND CROSS-CHECK THAT
WITH HOSPITAL RECORDS.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.504
HE MIGHT HAVE MADE
FREQUENT TRIPS TO THE E.R.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.998
JUST AS RANDY MARTIN
AGED OUT OF THE SYSTEM,

24:11.050 --> 24:13.518
RANDY JACOBS POPPED UP.
BUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,

24:13.550 --> 24:16.917
HE HAS NO CRIMINAL HISTORY.
HE HAS A STABLE JOB.

24:16.950 --> 24:20.784
AND HE RECENTLY GOT ENGAGED
TO HIS LONG-TIME GIRLFRIEND
CHLOE ANDREWS.

24:20.820 --> 24:25.154
SOUNDS LIKE HE WENT FROM
A MODEL CITIZEN
TO A COLD-BLOODED MURDERER.

24:25.190 --> 24:28.853
HIS BIRTHMOTHER FLORA MARTIN
HAS QUITE A HISTORY, HOWEVER.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.151
CHECK YOUR TABLETS.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.964
[TABLETS BEEPING]

24:35.040 --> 24:38.532
WELL, AROUND THE TIME
RANDY WOULD HAVE BEEN
CONCEIVED,

24:38.570 --> 24:40.208
FLORA WAS ADMITTED
TO THE HOSPITAL.
SHE'D BEEN RAPED.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.878
SHE WAS 30 AT THE TIME.

24:41.910 --> 24:43.741
I SAYS HERE SHE'D BEEN
HITCHHIKING

24:43.780 --> 24:45.873
AND WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
BY A TRUCK DRIVER.

24:45.910 --> 24:47.719
ACCORDING TO HER STATEMENT,
HER ATTACKER DRAGGED HER

24:47.750 --> 24:50.639
INTO A TRUCK STOP REST ROOM
AND DID BAD THINGS.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.942
THAT'S THE EXACT SAME. M.O.
THAT CAN'T BE A COINCIDENCE.

24:52.990 --> 24:54.855
THIS CASE IS THE NEXUS.

24:54.890 --> 24:56.778
SO MOTHER AND SON
MUST HAVE RECENTLY REUNITED

24:56.820 --> 24:59.027
AND HE'S BEEN GOING
OFF THE KILL LIST
THAT SHE PROVIDED.

24:59.060 --> 25:01.995

ABOUT FLORA MARTIN?

25:02.030 --> 25:06.729
9 MONTHS AFTER HER ALLEGED RAPE
SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON.

33:14.390 --> 33:16.210
NO. NO.

33:16.260 --> 33:17.386

33:17.420 --> 33:19.229
BEFORE THEY FOUND YOU
HOLED UP IN THAT BARN

33:19.260 --> 33:20.625
OUTSIDE THE CITY.

33:20.660 --> 33:23.697
YOU COULD HAVE EASILY
KEPT KILLING,
BUT YOU STOPPED.

33:23.730 --> 33:25.561
IT WAS TIME TO GIVE UP.

33:25.600 --> 33:29.161
SEE, I DON'T THINK
YOU GAVE UP.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.462
I THINK YOU STOPPED

33:30.500 --> 33:33.162
BECAUSE YOU FOUND
WHO YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.

33:33.210 --> 33:36.031
THE MAN WHO RAPED YOU.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.447
RAN DY'S FATHER.

ISN'T HE?

34:04.210 --> 34:08.135
MOTHER WAS RIGHT.

DROP THE KNIFE, RANDY.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.254

36:34.290 --> 36:36.815
DO YOU KNOW WHY

36:39.530 --> 36:41.919
THIS PLACE MEANS
SOMETHING TO YOU.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.726
YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

36:56.440 --> 36:59.739
Morgan: RANDY, YOUR
MOTHER'S BEEN USING YOU
SINCE YOU WERE A CHILD.

36:59.780 --> 37:01.839
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE
TAKEN AWAY FROM HER.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.677
Lewis:
YOU WERE HER PATSY.

37:03.720 --> 37:07.247
SHE NEEDED YOU TO CONTINUE
TO DO HER DIRTY WORK.

37:07.290 --> 37:10.509
SHE WAS USING YOU BACK THEN
AND SHE'S STILL USING YOU NOW.

38:03.710 --> 38:05.371
AAH!

38:05.410 --> 38:07.742
Lewis: RANDY.

38:07.780 --> 38:09.771
YOUR MOTHER FORCED YOU
TO PARTICIPATE

38:09.820 --> 38:11.481
IN THE MURDER
OF YOUR FATHER.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.624
AND THEN THE TWO OF YOU
BURIED HIM HERE.

38:21.830 --> 38:23.957
Morgan: COME ON, MAN.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.525
WE ALL HAVE CHOICES.

38:27.670 --> 38:30.332
Lewis: IT'S NOT TOO LATE
FOR YOU TO CHOOSE

38:30.370 --> 38:32.759
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.732
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE
DEFINED

38:34.780 --> 38:37.408
BY THE SINS OF YOUR FATHER
OR YOUR MOTHER.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.112
[GASPING]

38:45.150 --> 38:47.345
COME HERE.

38:47.390 --> 38:49.654
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.592

OF A MOTHER

39:09.480 --> 39:11.038
"IN THE LIVES
OF HER CHILDREN

39:11.080 --> 39:13.571

39:13.610 --> 39:15.441
JAMES E. FAUST.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.414
FLORA SIGNED A CONFESSION.

39:17.450 --> 39:18.917
SHE ADMITTED
TO MAKING RANDY

39:18.950 --> 39:20.588

IN HIS FATHER'S MURDER.

39:20.620 --> 39:22.451
JJ: ALL THIS TIME
HE SEEMED TO HAVE

39:22.490 --> 39:25.459
SUCH A NORMAL,
WELL-ADJUSTED LIFE.

39:25.490 --> 39:27.549
YEAH, BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS
THAT VOID INSIDE OF HIM.

39:27.590 --> 39:29.820
EVEN AFTER HE FOUND OUT
WHO HIS MOTHER WAS,

39:29.860 --> 39:30.997
HE STILL WANTED TO BUILD
A RELATIONSHIP.

39:31.030 --> 39:33.624
YEAH. AND THAT'S HOW
SHE WAS ABLE TO PLAY
ON HIS EMOTIONS.

39:33.670 --> 39:37.731
AND HE WANTED RETRIBUTION
FOR HIS MOTHER,
NO MATTER THE COST.

39:37.770 --> 39:40.739
JJ: SOMETIMES WE LET
THE NEED TO CONNECT

39:40.770 --> 39:43.807
AND BOND WITH OUR
FAMILIES TRUMP ANY KIND
OF JUDGMENT.

39:43.840 --> 39:47.879

THAN ANYONE CAN UNDERSTAND.
