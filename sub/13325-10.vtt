WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:04.703
So, sateen.
You've now heard your sister
and the rest of the group

00:04.705 --> 00:08.741
<i>Talk about how</i>
<i>inappropriate anger</i>
<i>can damage your life.</i>

00:08.743 --> 00:11.310
I'd love to hear
what you're thinking
right now.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.078
I was thinking

00:13.080 --> 00:15.214
If all you're serving
is supermarket muffins,

00:15.216 --> 00:17.616
You might want to check
if your guest is gluten-free

00:17.618 --> 00:19.752
Because I am
and they're not.

00:21.054 --> 00:24.156
Frankly, I'm bloated
and insulted.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.060
This isn't about the muffins,
you little bitch.

00:28.062 --> 00:31.130
It's about how angry you are
and how I don't want you
to end up like me.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.098
Telling your problems
to a bunch of losers

00:33.100 --> 00:35.267
In some horrible
living room in
the valley.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.369
Excuse me.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.039
I take offense
to the term "loser,"

00:40.041 --> 00:42.374
But I do agree with
"horrible living room
in valley."

00:43.676 --> 00:46.178
Where do all you people live,
like, versailles?

00:48.214 --> 00:49.815
I've got a question.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.617
<i>Lacey, sateen.</i>

00:51.619 --> 00:53.786
Did your parents
pick your names

00:53.788 --> 00:56.355
Out of
an underwear drawer?

00:56.357 --> 00:59.391
They're family names
from india, old man.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.227
I'm sorry they don't have
the beauty and dignity of ed.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.632
Wait, go back.
Did you call me
a bitch, bitch?

01:06.634 --> 01:11.136
- You actually suck.
- No, you suck and no one
asked you.

01:11.138 --> 01:13.605
- At least
I wasn't a fat baby.
- I wasn't a fat baby.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.207
They overfed me.

01:15.209 --> 01:19.211
All this yelling.
It's really hard on me.

01:19.213 --> 01:22.181
Can't you two just,
like, wrestle it out?

01:23.450 --> 01:26.418
Nolan, do you realize that
everything you've said today

01:26.420 --> 01:29.154
About lacey
and her sister has been
a veiled sexual reference?

01:29.156 --> 01:32.758
And by veiled,
I don't mean anything
culturally insensitive.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.159
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:34.161 --> 01:37.229
And by sorry,
I mean the apology.

01:37.231 --> 01:40.165
Not the giant scarf
you wear like a dress.

01:41.501 --> 01:43.735
Not everything
I said was sexual.

01:43.737 --> 01:47.639
That tandoori taco twofer
at the street fair
is a real thing.

01:49.175 --> 01:51.577
No, it's not.

01:51.579 --> 01:55.180
Okay. Sateen,
after observing you
a little bit today,

01:55.182 --> 01:57.182
I really think you could use
some anger management therapy.

01:57.184 --> 01:59.251
Let me be careful.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.286
I wanna say this
in the rudest possible way.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.722
You just did.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.824
Godspeed.
See ya in prison.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.862
The rest of ya,
I'll see ya next week.

02:12.665 --> 02:15.868
Hey, I don't know
what's going on with me today.

02:15.870 --> 02:18.604
I think
I'm gonna
walk it off.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.873
I said walk,
not whack, right?

02:20.875 --> 02:22.908
Yes, you did.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.844
Ah, spank god.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.147
I need to talk to you
about your dad.

02:30.416 --> 02:33.152
Did you need to talk to me
or did dad conveniently
bump into you

02:33.154 --> 02:34.920
And con you into
doing his dirty work?

02:34.922 --> 02:37.890
No, I ran into him
at the lady footlocker
and he told me--

02:37.892 --> 02:40.559
Damn, he's good.

02:40.561 --> 02:44.229
Let me guess. He doesn't
understand why I won't spend
more time with him?

02:44.231 --> 02:46.798
No, he doesn't, charlie.
It's really bothering him.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.534
Maybe he should have
thought about that
when he was being

02:48.536 --> 02:51.170
A manipulative, lying bully
my entire life.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.838
People forgive,
charlie.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.240
I've had manipulative,
lying people in my life

02:55.242 --> 02:58.911
And I've forgiven...
Mostly... Charlie...
You.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.547
Charlie. Dork.

03:01.549 --> 03:04.950
Yeah. Got it.
You, not letting go...
Ever.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.618
Take foot off neck.
Love you.

03:06.620 --> 03:10.956
Come on. He just
wants to come over Sunday
and watch a game with you.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.458
- Who wants to come over?
- Your grandfather.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.928
Great. Why doesn't he
come over more often?

03:15.930 --> 03:19.264
- Doesn't he like us?
- Yeah, charlie. Why doesn't
he come over more often?

03:19.266 --> 03:20.966
I think sam just hit it
on the head.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.502
He doesn't like us.

03:23.504 --> 03:26.505
Let's not force a frightened
old man into doing something
he doesn't wanna do.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.774
- Charlie.
- All right, fine.

03:28.776 --> 03:31.510
He can come over on Sunday,
but you gotta be there, too.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.812
And, you,
little miss "why won't
grandpa come over,"

03:33.814 --> 03:35.380
You want a grandpa so bad?

03:35.382 --> 03:37.683
You have to feed
and take care of him.

03:37.685 --> 03:41.320
And the first time you don't,
it's right back to the pound.

03:44.757 --> 03:46.458
<i>Jennifer:</i>
<i>Oh, charlie.</i>
<i>Look at you.</i>

03:46.460 --> 03:49.494
Putting out
food for your dad.
That's so sweet.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.230
No, this isn't sweet.

03:51.232 --> 03:54.833
This is turkey
and swiss on sourdough.
No mayo, no oil.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.469
This is the driest,
chewiest sandwich
you can get.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.538
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

03:59.540 --> 04:01.440
He can't chew and talk.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.909
That is three feet
of golden silence.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.911
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

04:05.913 --> 04:09.281
- Hey.
- Hi. Nice suit.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.483
I thought you were coming
to watch the game, but if
you're here to be buried,

04:11.485 --> 04:15.254
- That's okay, too.
- We can watch the game
after mass.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.889
Why aren't you dressed?
You know, mass starts
in half an hour.

04:19.359 --> 04:21.360
Well, you told me
you go to mass
every week.

04:21.362 --> 04:24.263
- You weren't lying
about that, were you?
- No, of course not.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.265
I-- I go every Sunday.

04:26.267 --> 04:29.301
Thank god,
because if you didn't,
it would kill your grandmother.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.270
- Grandma's dead.
- <i>Yeah, I know,</i>

04:31.272 --> 04:34.306
But I still like
to remember the things
that would kill her.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.008
Hey, girls.
Let's get started.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.343
I don't wanna walk in late
like I own the joint.

04:38.345 --> 04:40.879
Okay, sam.
Go put on your fancy

04:40.881 --> 04:43.415
Going-to-church outfit
like we do every Sunday.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.885
- But, dad, we don't--
- hey, blessed be the shut up.
Get dressed.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.456
<i>( organ playing )</i>

04:56.529 --> 04:58.363
It's a beautiful church,
charlie.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.332
Yeah, it is.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.968
I just hope the priest
isn't too long-winded.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.570
No, no, no.
He's great.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.639
His sermons
are very insightful.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.442
I find myself
hanging on his
every word.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.446
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

05:15.882 --> 05:17.582
<i>( speaking spanish )</i>

05:32.799 --> 05:34.866
( chuckles )

05:37.804 --> 05:41.073
So, charlie.
You say you come here
every week?

05:41.075 --> 05:42.741
<i>SÃ­.</i>

05:45.778 --> 05:47.846
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

05:54.620 --> 05:57.989
I'm a grown man.
I don't need to
explain myself to you.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.891
It's not about me.

05:59.893 --> 06:02.828
Your daughter needs
a religious upbringing,
charlie.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.796
She needs a moral compass.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.898
I'm sorry.
I'm still reeling from
"it's not about me."

06:08.735 --> 06:11.837
Look, I know what you want,
but I'm not gonna force
catholicism on sam

06:11.839 --> 06:16.575
Then why did you even bother
having her baptized
in the first place?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.944
I have a good answer for that.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.979
Sam was never baptized.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.449
I thought it was good.

06:24.451 --> 06:27.052
She was never baptized?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.820
So you lied
about that, too.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.956
I tell ya lots
of lies, dad--

06:30.958 --> 06:33.058
"good to see ya,"
"happy birthday,"
"drive safe."

06:33.060 --> 06:35.727
Okay, enough.
Look, we're gonna deal
with this right now.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.696
You're having sam baptized,
period.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.931
- That's it.
- No, I'm not.

06:39.933 --> 06:42.033
Sam is gonna choose
her own religion

06:42.035 --> 06:43.969
When she's old enough
to make a mature decision.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.937
I'm only gonna say this once--
stay out of it.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.141
Don't you understand?
If you don't have that
girl baptized-- god forbid,

06:49.143 --> 06:51.443
But she could end up
in hell and it'd be
all your fault.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.846
Charlie, I told you,
the women you're dating
are way too young.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.582
Michael,
are you catholic
by any chance?

06:57.584 --> 06:59.551
I'm a pretty
good catholic.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.686
For a baptist.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.854
I'm a better
catholic than
charlie.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.090
I think it's damn selfish
of you, son.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.726
After all, you were baptized
and received first communion.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.961
Now you're leaving
your own daughter
high and dry like this.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.197
I think it's just
plain disgraceful.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.032
Would you give me an amen
on that, michael?

07:14.034 --> 07:15.801
Don't give him
an amen on that.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.770
Your kid's not baptized?
What, are you nuts?

07:18.772 --> 07:22.641
- Thanks, mike.
- Seriously, it takes,
like, five minutes

07:22.643 --> 07:24.576
And it protects her soul
for eternity.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.812
Look, I appreciate
your spiritual concern.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.680
Especially coming from a guy
with a lifetime membership

07:28.682 --> 07:31.450
To adult friend finder.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.718
But my daughter is not
gonna get kicked out
of heaven--

07:33.720 --> 07:36.521
If there is one--
on a technicality.

07:36.523 --> 07:39.991
- If there is one?
- I know we raised him
better than that.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.962
Look, it's my kid.
Everyone just back off.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.732
All right, fine. I won't
interfere in trying to help save
my granddaughter's soul.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.634
God forbid. Sorry.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.236
God-- if there is one--
forbid.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.841
Nice one, sir.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.909
I mean it.
This is my house,
these are my rules.

07:57.911 --> 08:01.613
Michael, I don't like
this new kid you're
hanging out with.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.883
Doesn't he have
any friends his own age?

08:07.520 --> 08:10.722
So I dropped sateen off
and my mom starts in on me.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.891
When are you gonna marry
a nice hindu boy?

08:12.893 --> 08:16.795
And I said,
"when a hindu boy
starts for the lakers."

08:16.797 --> 08:19.965
Right now I'm all about
giant black millionaires.

08:20.766 --> 08:22.534
Let me ask you
this, lacey.

08:22.536 --> 08:25.837
Is this anger about
rejecting your parents'
religious values

08:25.839 --> 08:29.808
Or is it just another
manifestation of your
kardashian envy?

08:29.810 --> 08:33.578
Oh, it's not envy
when you're better
than somebody.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.247
Hey, you're a hindu.

08:35.249 --> 08:39.518
Tell your mom you'll do
what she wants in
your next life.

08:39.520 --> 08:43.154
You'll be a raccoon,
she'll be a bird or something.
She can't hold you to it.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.893
Congratulations, ed.
You just created
a new category--

08:47.895 --> 08:49.261
Metaphysical racism.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.531
Sorry to interrupt
this battle of wits

08:52.533 --> 08:54.766
Between aristotle
and yosemite sam,

08:54.768 --> 08:57.102
But your daughter's here
and I'm pretty sure
she's bleeding.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.638
Oh, my god.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.840
Sam, what happened?
You okay?

09:01.842 --> 09:06.211
Some lunatic ran a stop sign
and forced her bicycle
into a mailbox.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.246
I was just walking up
when the guy pulled away.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.015
She could've been
killed, charlie.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.017
Come on, sweetie.
Let's get you cleaned up
in the kitchen.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.586
Sorry, guys.
I'll see ya next Tuesday.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.721
Damn fool was
probably texting.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.291
If anything happened
to that girl, I'd never
forgive myself.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.960
Forgive yourself for what?
You weren't involved.

09:21.962 --> 09:25.196
Yeah, well,
there's a big problem
between charlie and me.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.632
My granddaughter's
never been baptized.

09:27.634 --> 09:30.835
Christ on a pony,
why the hell not?!

09:30.837 --> 09:34.239
- What the hell's
the matter with your boy?
- There's a long list.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.241
He's selfish, he thinks
he knows everything,

09:36.243 --> 09:38.977
He's got his mother's hips,
and he's agnostic.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.879
Agnostic?

09:40.881 --> 09:42.847
How can anybody doubt god

09:42.849 --> 09:44.883
When they've seen a picture
of angie dickinson?

09:44.885 --> 09:49.821
I know I said
I wouldn't interfere, but god
just fired a warning shot

09:49.823 --> 09:51.990
And I gotta figure out a way
to have her baptized.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.993
I'll tell you what we'd do
in my church back in texas.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.228
We'd wait till
they went to sleep,
put a bag over their head,

09:57.230 --> 09:59.130
Throw 'em in the back
of the truck, drive 'em
to the river,

09:59.132 --> 10:01.733
And let the preacher
hold 'em under for a minute.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.868
That sounds
a little radical, ed.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.237
Radical, hell,
it's terrifying,

10:06.239 --> 10:09.074
But they'll thank ya
in paradise.

10:09.076 --> 10:12.010
Well, I guess
I could sneak around.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.745
Thanks for
the advice, ed.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.681
I used to get $10 a head
doing that back home.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.017
I'd go down to
the bus station,
scoop 'em up--

10:19.019 --> 10:21.086
You sure that was
for baptisms?

10:21.088 --> 10:23.888
'cause it sounds like
you were trying to
drown illegals.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.991
No, no.
It was baptism--

10:25.993 --> 10:27.926
Wait a minute.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.394
No, no.
It was baptism.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.364
Okay. Well, we'll see ya
next week, buddy.
All the best.

10:34.233 --> 10:36.067
- Kate?
-  <i>Yeah?</i>

10:36.069 --> 10:37.969
- You didn't answer me.
-  <i>About what?</i>

10:37.971 --> 10:40.171
<i>I'm busy getting</i>
<i>your surprise ready.</i>

10:40.173 --> 10:42.307
Do you think my dad
has a point?

10:42.309 --> 10:44.976
Was I selfish to not give sam
a religious upbringing?

10:46.912 --> 10:49.814
<i>Was I rebelling</i>
<i>because my dad shoved</i>
<i>the church down my throat</i>

10:49.816 --> 10:52.384
And that's why catholicism
is such a turnoff to me?

10:58.824 --> 11:00.859
- You almost done?
- <i>Almost.</i>

11:02.261 --> 11:05.263
- Must be a hell
of a surprise.
- <i>Oh, it will be.</i>

11:11.337 --> 11:13.204
That's my surprise?

11:13.206 --> 11:14.906
You're wearing my t-shirt?

11:14.908 --> 11:17.108
What's wrong
with the t-shirt?

11:18.744 --> 11:20.945
Nothing, nothing.
It's super sexy.

11:20.947 --> 11:23.982
I like the way it makes
your whole upper body
look like a...

11:23.984 --> 11:26.985
Hot rectangle.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.687
A crew neck.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.857
I know.
I feel so dirty.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.731
I don't wanna turn this
into a whole session here,

11:39.733 --> 11:44.169
I get all dressed up
like this and you
just wanna talk?

11:46.439 --> 11:47.972
Just for a minute.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.375
Do you think my anger
towards my dad's behavior

11:50.377 --> 11:52.010
Is affecting the way
I raise my kid?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.812
Of course it is.

11:53.814 --> 11:57.148
I mean, your choice
is to either repeat
or correct.

11:57.150 --> 12:00.218
The same heat that melts
the butter hardens the egg.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.021
I want you
so bad right now.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.325
You know,
if you want
your daughter

12:07.327 --> 12:10.328
To make an informed choice,
don't wait until she's 18.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.464
Show her all
the options now.

12:12.466 --> 12:15.166
Once upon a time,

12:15.168 --> 12:17.001
I was a vampire goth chick.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.170
Those girls
have a lot of fun.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.106
You would've hated me
back in high school.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.408
- I was a jock.
- I would've slept
with you anyhow.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.878
- We slept with everybody.
- So did we.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.115
Except for those losers
in the model u.N.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.083
We slept with everybody.

12:38.390 --> 12:42.026
Wow, look at this list. We're
gonna have
to split this up

12:42.028 --> 12:45.096
If we're gonna expose sam
to all the different
religions.

12:46.031 --> 12:47.332
I'll take christianity

12:47.334 --> 12:50.135
And you take all
the going-to-hell ones.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.104
- We're not off
to a good start here.
- I'm kidding.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.474
I just don't know much
about religions outside
of christianity.

12:56.476 --> 13:01.112
I know catholicism
and the native american one
where you take peyote.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.515
And all I know about that one
is that you take peyote.

13:05.084 --> 13:08.419
You know, I always thought
it would be good for her
to have some religion.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.488
What if she picks
one of ours?

13:10.490 --> 13:12.457
I'm comfortable with her
going protestant.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.059
Are you comfortable
if she decides to
become catholic?

13:15.061 --> 13:17.962
I-- I guess.
I just blocked
so much of it out.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.865
I do remember catholic
baseball camp, though.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.168
Man, it was hard
to run in those sandals.

13:23.170 --> 13:26.171
- They made you wear sandals?
- That was just the beginning.

13:26.173 --> 13:29.574
Every time I stole second,
I had to say an act
of contrition.

13:29.576 --> 13:33.211
- Is this thing working?
- Come on, charlie.
Get serious.

13:33.213 --> 13:37.182
You're right, you're right.
Did you know our pitcher had
to give a sermon on the mound?

13:38.250 --> 13:40.485
Hey, guys.

13:40.487 --> 13:44.255
Eh, sam has something
she'd like to tell ya.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.124
What's up, sam?

13:46.126 --> 13:49.427
I... Got baptized.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.397
- You what?!
- Hang on, son.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.399
This was entirely
her own choice.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.568
We were talking about god
and spirituality

13:56.570 --> 13:58.436
<i>And the importance</i>
<i>of being a good person,</i>

13:58.438 --> 14:01.940
And I said the only way
I know how to do that is
to become a catholic.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.175
Dad, what did we talk about?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.144
My granddaughter
came to me and said,

14:06.146 --> 14:09.881
"I'd like to be baptized,
grandpa." what was I
supposed to say, no?

14:09.883 --> 14:12.584
- Yes.
- Oh, you wouldn't say that
if you'd been there.

14:12.586 --> 14:15.153
Look, I got some pictures
on the cell phone here.

14:15.155 --> 14:18.056
Look, martin.
We're sam's parents,
okay?

14:18.058 --> 14:21.192
It's not your right to--
oh, she's an angel.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.998
- Who the hell
are those people?
- Oh, those are the godparents.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.367
Carmen and angel.
When you meet 'em,
you'll love 'em.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.406
Look, sam.
Your mom and I
don't want you

14:35.408 --> 14:38.042
To be rushed into anything
or talked into anything.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.445
So let's start by going down
to that church and returning
your baptism.

14:40.447 --> 14:43.381
You can do that,
right?

14:43.383 --> 14:46.284
I think it's too late.
She's dry.

14:47.419 --> 14:50.255
Don't be mad at grandpa.
I'm really happy
I did this.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.156
But you didn't look
at any other options.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.292
Yeah, and I just found
this cool dumpling place

14:54.294 --> 14:57.428
Next to the buddhist
temple downtown.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.998
What's wrong
with being catholic?
Her family's catholic.

15:01.300 --> 15:03.935
I don't like
her family.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.537
They got pork,
they got shrimp,
everything.

15:06.539 --> 15:10.041
It has a c on the window,
but it looks clean inside.

15:11.510 --> 15:13.945
You know, dad,
you could come
to church with us.

15:13.947 --> 15:17.448
- I don't want
you to go to hell.
- Are you happy?

15:17.450 --> 15:20.184
My own daughter
doesn't want me
to go to hell.

15:20.186 --> 15:23.254
All right.
You wanna go
to church, fine.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.291
Let's do this the right way.
I want you to know what
you're getting into.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.459
So, I'm gonna
go with you.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.495
Lord, talk about
mysterious ways.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.298
My son and my granddaughter
wanna go to mass with me.

15:33.300 --> 15:36.034
Hallelujah,
I am truly blessed.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.202
Hey, pope piehole iii.

15:39.605 --> 15:43.041
Why don't you give
the children's crusade
a rest?

15:43.043 --> 15:46.344
I'm taking my daughter
to church... Without you.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.447
Then I'm taking her
to a synagogue, a mosque,
and a buddhist temple.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.616
And then that
dumpling place
right next door.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.217
Be crazy not to go.

15:56.255 --> 15:57.655
See these plaques?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.624
Those are called
the stations of the cross.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.592
If you follow the story
all the way around
the church,

16:01.594 --> 16:03.194
You'll find out
what happened to 'em.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.129
Oh, this one right here.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.365
That's where the romans
nailed jesus to the cross.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.201
Oh, my god.
Where were the catholics
during all this?

16:11.637 --> 16:14.072
Interesting question.
There were no catholics.

16:14.074 --> 16:18.543
- What?
- Sam, did you know
that jesus was jewish?

16:18.545 --> 16:21.546
Whoa. He converted
to christianity?

16:23.115 --> 16:25.316
Why don't we just watch
for a while?

16:25.318 --> 16:28.286
Oh, look at the pretty glass
up in that window.

16:28.288 --> 16:32.523
What the hell
are you doing here?
I told you to back off.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.759
I didn't know
you were going to
the 9:00 mass,

16:34.761 --> 16:38.329
But, hey, I can leave
if my son doesn't want me
to practice my faith.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.331
No, no, no.
Just sit down
and shut up.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.066
- Dad.
- I'm sorry.
We're in church.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.068
Please, sit down
and please shut up.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.743
- If you have any
questions, just ask me.
- I have a question.

16:51.745 --> 16:56.314
How many angels
can dance on the head
of an unconscious old man?

16:56.316 --> 16:58.616
Speaking of angels.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.252
As promised,
there you are,
young lady.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.554
- What is that?
- Saint christopher medal.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.656
It's to keep me safe
while I ride my bike.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.593
Oh, cool.
Does it come with
a reflector jesus?

17:10.229 --> 17:14.165
Dad, you know
sam has ocd,

17:14.167 --> 17:15.566
<i>So loading her up with</i>
<i>a bunch of good luck charms--</i>

17:15.568 --> 17:17.702
Probably not
the best idea
in the world.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.038
But that's why
I wanted to be catholic.

17:20.040 --> 17:24.442
- What?
- Catholicism is perfect
for a kid with ocd.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.444
She can light candles
for her problems,

17:26.446 --> 17:28.479
She can go to confession
when she gets worried,

17:28.481 --> 17:31.649
And when she feels compelled
to count, she can do it on
her rosary.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.218
- She doesn't have a rosary.
- She does now.

17:37.456 --> 17:39.357
Sam.

17:43.195 --> 17:46.464
You used her ocd
so you could get her
to become a catholic?

17:46.466 --> 17:49.600
- You selfish bastard.
- I saved her soul and honor
thy father,

17:49.602 --> 17:52.203
You arrogant son of a...

17:52.205 --> 17:54.272
Me.

17:54.274 --> 17:58.209
Don't you get it?
You sent a diabetic
to the candy store.

17:58.211 --> 18:00.645
You know what?
You are out of
my life again.

18:00.647 --> 18:03.748
You can keep me out
of your life, but you can't
keep me out of hers.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.817
And keep your voice down,
you're setting a bad example.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.752
Oh, I'm setting
a bad example?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.654
You used a necklace
to bribe

18:09.656 --> 18:12.123
A 15-year-old girl
to get her to do
what you want

18:12.125 --> 18:13.691
And I'm the bad guy?

18:18.564 --> 18:19.864
Hola.

18:24.236 --> 18:26.471
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.573
It's been almost...

18:28.575 --> 18:30.708
30 years since
my last confession.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.644
You've been leading
a very righteous life,
my son.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.347
Eh, no.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.516
But I need
your help, father.

18:38.518 --> 18:41.786
I want you to tell my daughter
that she's come to the church
for the wrong reasons.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.722
There's no such thing
as the wrong reason.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.757
Yeah, forgive me, father,
but as a kid,

18:46.759 --> 18:50.728
I used to come here
to see girls on their knees
with their tongues out.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.531
Okay...

18:53.533 --> 18:55.633
That may be
a new "hail mary" record

18:55.635 --> 18:57.802
You've got there.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.638
Look, my daughter
was tricked.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.640
She's got ocd
and she's only
here because

19:02.642 --> 19:06.544
She's attracted to all
the trinkets and the rituals
and the saints.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.747
So, she's attracted to
the catholicism.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.782
Okay, you're not
hearing me here.

19:11.784 --> 19:15.586
My son,
god brings people
to the church

19:15.588 --> 19:17.755
In many
different ways.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.657
Yeah, so did my dad.

19:19.659 --> 19:23.761
By the ear, by the arm,
by the neck.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.864
Thank god I found the girls.
He was running out of things
to grab.

19:29.601 --> 19:32.236
Father, can you at least
smite my dad?

19:34.640 --> 19:38.776
I'm sorry, but the church
is here for everyone.

19:38.778 --> 19:42.313
Now, is there anything
you'd like to confess?

19:42.315 --> 19:44.782
No, I think I'm good.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.684
Oh...

19:46.686 --> 19:48.619
This morning in church,

19:48.621 --> 19:50.855
I might have called
my dad a child molester.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.924
Yes, we heard you.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.200
- Kate: <i>So sam</i>
<i>is staying catholic?</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah, she loves it.</i>

20:02.202 --> 20:05.236
Now I can't kill my dad
because that would
make him a martyr

20:05.238 --> 20:07.271
And she'd walk around
for the rest of her life

20:07.273 --> 20:09.640
Wearing a necklace
with his face on it.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.877
<i>Since that's the fourth time</i>
<i>you've mentioned killing</i>
<i>your father,</i>

20:12.879 --> 20:16.747
<i>I'm guessing you two</i>
<i>still have some unresolved</i>
<i>issues to work out?</i>

20:16.749 --> 20:18.849
Oh, no.
They're resolved.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.952
I told him he's not allowed
at my house anymore.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.753
<i>Where is he now?</i>

20:22.755 --> 20:24.956
He's at my house.

20:24.958 --> 20:28.859
Let me guess,
catholic guilt?

20:28.861 --> 20:31.462
With all of
the religious talk
going on,

20:31.464 --> 20:34.966
I thought it was important
for somebody to represent
the other side.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.402
Is this gonna
cost me my soul?

20:38.404 --> 20:42.707
No, you just have to be ready
to keep going for eternity.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.676
I'm-- I'm good for now,
but seriously, I have to
get to work tomorrow.
