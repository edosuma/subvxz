per Penny Blossom?

- No, of course you're not. All right.

- Before taxes.

Yeah, my brilliance and innovation,
of course, but still.

13:34.497 --> 13:36.658
I just don't see how we can pull this off.

13:36.832 --> 13:40.233
Okay, that, right there,
that equivocation and self-doubt...

13:40.402 --> 13:42.495
...that is not the American spirit.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.766
Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo?
Did Jim Bowie?

13:47.409 --> 13:50.708
They didn't quit. They were massacred...

13:51.480 --> 13:55.849
...by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.

13:56.852 --> 14:00.618
All right, let me put it this way.
Your gross receipts on this one order...

14:00.789 --> 14:03.553
...will be over $3000
for one night's work.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.952
You guys get started.

14:07.763 --> 14:11.529
- What are you doing?
- Going online to buy shoes.

THE MOUNTAIN WHEN SHE COMES"]

If I wanted to spend
my Saturday nights doing this...

14:26.549 --> 14:29.074
...I could have stayed in India.

14:30.853 --> 14:33.014
Oh, stop with the fake third-world crap.

14:33.188 --> 14:36.385
Your father's a gynecologist
and you had a house full of servants.

14:36.559 --> 14:40.086
We only had four servants.
And two of them were children.

14:43.232 --> 14:44.256
How are we doing?

14:44.433 --> 14:47.596
We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms
ready to ship.

14:47.770 --> 14:50.637
God, we're never gonna finish in time.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.603
- Hold.
RAJESH: Who made Sheldon the boss?

14:52.775 --> 14:56.370
I believe I'm hearing some negativity
on the factory floor.

14:58.581 --> 15:01.744
- So?
- The labor force is a living organism...

15:01.917 --> 15:03.077
...that must be nurtured.

15:03.252 --> 15:06.221
Any counterproductive grumbling
must be skillfully headed off...

15:06.388 --> 15:09.653
...by management. Observe. Hey!

15:09.825 --> 15:11.918
Less talk, more work.

15:14.630 --> 15:16.495
- Nicely done.
- Thank you.

- Honey, do you want some coffee?
- No, I don't drink coffee.

If you don't stay awake,
we'll never finish.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.267
I'm sorry. Coffee is out of the question.

15:53.435 --> 15:57.303
When I moved to California, I promised my
mother that I wouldn't start doing drugs.

15:57.773 --> 15:58.967
Leonard, help.

15:59.141 --> 16:01.974
Sheldon, we still have 380
of these things to make.

16:02.144 --> 16:04.704
I have faith that you will make them.
Good night.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.711
- Leonard.
- Yeah-- No.

16:06.882 --> 16:12.718
But, Sheldon, without your insight and
leadership, this enterprise will surely fail.

16:15.090 --> 16:17.115
You're right, of course.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.224
Here, this will help.

16:21.597 --> 16:23.326
Very well.

16:23.699 --> 16:26.099
But if this leads to opiates
or hallucinogenics...

16:26.268 --> 16:28.896
...you're gonna have to answer
to my mother.

16:31.040 --> 16:34.271
Look at Planck's constant.
People say that's arbitrary.

16:34.443 --> 16:37.344
That could not be less arbitrary.
If it varied even slightly...

16:37.513 --> 16:40.949
...life as we know it would not exist. Bam!

16:44.186 --> 16:48.213
Now, now, let's reconsider the entire
argument but with entropy reversed...

16:48.390 --> 16:49.948
...and effect preceding cause.

16:50.125 --> 16:54.118
So you are thinking of a universe.
It's not expanding from the center, no.

16:54.296 --> 16:58.357
It is retreating
from a possibility space. Bam!

17:00.736 --> 17:06.196
This is a space where we are all essentially
Alice standing in front of the Red Queen...

17:06.375 --> 17:09.708

to quench our thirst.

I am really grateful for your help...

I'm gonna give you 20 cents.

- One-day rush.

18:07.102 --> 18:10.594
I really need to take that off the website.

Davy Crockett.
Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.

Yes, I know that, okay? I'm tired
