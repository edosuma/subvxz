[birds chirping]

00:35.969 --> 00:38.335
I heard a funny joke the other day.

00:38.438 --> 00:42.465
It seems a doctor, a lawyer,
and a gentleman from Oklahoma--

00:42.575 --> 00:44.770
I told you that joke. I want to tell it.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.903
You'll just ruin it. Let Hank tell it.

00:47.013 --> 00:48.605
It's my joke! I'm gonna tell it.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.183
There was this doctor. And then....

00:51.284 --> 00:52.478
[groaning]

00:53.420 --> 00:56.082
[chuckling]
That was pretty funny. Tell it again.

00:56.489 --> 00:58.753
I'm okay. I'm okay.

00:58.858 --> 01:01.691
Whoa! What the heck kind of ball is this?

01:01.795 --> 01:04.388
Sorry. I'm trying out for the lacrosse team.

01:04.497 --> 01:05.930
My son, the jock.

01:06.032 --> 01:10.435
With me and your mother as parents,
I don't know how you got so athletic.

01:10.537 --> 01:11.629
[car radio playing]

01:12.972 --> 01:14.633
Hey, John Redcorn.

01:15.208 --> 01:18.541
Well, okay, son.
Just be more careful where you're aiming.

01:18.645 --> 01:21.375
If Bill wasn't standing there,
you would've hit Hank's truck.

01:22.315 --> 01:26.012
I just want to thank you all again
for having me over tonight.

01:26.119 --> 01:30.920
Bill, any time you have a mild concussion,
you are welcome at this dinner table.

01:31.191 --> 01:34.126
Ma, would you pass the taters, please?

01:34.260 --> 01:37.593
What did I tell you about funny voices
at the dinner table?

01:37.697 --> 01:39.494
Hank, he is in character.

01:39.599 --> 01:43.899
The Arlen Public Library presents
OfMice aid Mei,,,

01:44.003 --> 01:46.028
next Friday and Saturday only.

01:46.139 --> 01:47.436
Of course, you would know that...

01:47.540 --> 01:50.100
if you read my ""What's Happening"" corner
of the refrigerator.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.609
I'm one of the two leads.

01:51.711 --> 01:56.273
The play's about a hard-working
regular Joe and his slow-witted friend.

01:58.318 --> 02:00.548
Yeah, I know a little bit about that.

02:00.653 --> 02:01.620
Perfect.

02:01.721 --> 02:04.121
Maybe after dinner
we can rehearse together.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.886
I've been looking for a vehicle
for the two of us.

02:07.494 --> 02:11.294
I'm kind of busy after dinner
with dessert and all.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.262
Why don't you ask your mother to help?

02:13.366 --> 02:16.335
She's good at that kind of creative stuff.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.238
Actually, I'm great at it.

02:19.339 --> 02:22.069
I played the lead
in my high school production of Grease,

02:22.175 --> 02:23.472
Danny Zuko.

02:23.576 --> 02:25.009
There you go, Bobby.

02:25.111 --> 02:27.579
Your mom's a substitute actor, too.

02:32.085 --> 02:35.748
You know, I'd love to.
But what I really want to do next is direct.

02:35.855 --> 02:37.288
Break a leg, Hank.

02:42.128 --> 02:43.288
[groaning]

02:43.663 --> 02:46.826
Great! I'm George, you'll be Lennie.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.900
""You want me to tell you
about the rabbits?""

02:50.003 --> 02:52.369
Is that what I'm eating? Rabbits?

02:52.472 --> 02:55.373
Because I can't taste a thing
with this broken nose.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.443
It's macaroni and cheese, Bill.

02:57.577 --> 02:59.169
Oh, l....

02:59.279 --> 03:00.644
[screaming]
Hot rabbits!

03:00.980 --> 03:02.379
[shouting]

03:03.249 --> 03:06.218
Joseph, you've gotta be more careful
with that thing.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.446
It wasn't me. My dad did it.

03:08.555 --> 03:09.920
Thanks a lot, son.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.253
You should try out
for the gymnastics team.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.826
You're pretty good at rolling over.

03:15.595 --> 03:17.290
I'm in over my head, Hank.

03:17.397 --> 03:22.096
I ran out of advice after I told him
to hold the stick like a giant cigarette.

03:23.570 --> 03:24.662
Heads up, Dad.

03:24.771 --> 03:25.738
[moans]

03:26.206 --> 03:27.867
Good hands, Mr. Hill.

03:28.908 --> 03:31.536
[chuckling]
So, what do you do? You just flick it?

03:32.412 --> 03:34.846
It's all about the follow-through.

03:38.251 --> 03:41.243
Well, so much for rehearsing
my play with Dad.

03:41.354 --> 03:44.084
No, honey. I'm sure
your father will be back any minute.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.886
He probably went to the hardware store
to fix the window...

03:46.993 --> 03:48.961
so we won't be murdered in our sleep.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.029
(Joseph) Heads up!

03:50.997 --> 03:52.692
Nice one, Mr. Hill.

03:54.467 --> 03:55.525
(Hank) Nice.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.938
What are you guys doing?
Catching butterflies?

04:00.840 --> 04:02.307
Sorry, Joseph.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.138
I've gotta go play make-believe
with Bobby.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.544
Thanks for the tips.
Maybe I can try them out with my dad.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.843
Whoa, wait a minute, Hank.

04:10.950 --> 04:15.011
I noticed when you threw the ball
to Joseph that it went to Joseph.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.055
Seems to me that
it would be good for him...

04:17.156 --> 04:19.454
to practice with a man who can do that.

04:19.559 --> 04:23.962
Yeah. I suppose it would, but I'm supposed
to rehearse with Bobby and....

04:24.063 --> 04:28.090
Hey, Dale, you always go to that
dinner theater with your gun-club buddies.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.668
Every Wednesday night.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.795
You think you could give Bobby
some pointers on acting?

04:32.905 --> 04:34.463
Could l? Yes.

04:34.574 --> 04:36.269
Will l? Yes.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.535
Bobby, good news.

04:39.579 --> 04:44.209
It turns out that Mr. Gribble is
one of Arlen's great acting rehearsers.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.683
-And he's willing to work with you.
-Oh.

04:47.553 --> 04:48.645
Okay.

04:48.921 --> 04:51.481
So, we're doing OfMice aid Mei, huh?

04:51.591 --> 04:54.025
I saw the dinner theater version of it.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.823
The roast beef was fantastic.

05:04.370 --> 05:05.997
This is a keeper.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.704
""That's right. It's gonna be nice there.

05:11.210 --> 05:14.202
""Ain't gonna be no trouble. No fights.

05:14.681 --> 05:18.515
""Nobody ever gonna hurt nobody,
or steal from them.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.211
""It's gonna be nice.""

05:25.124 --> 05:26.250
[sniffs]

05:27.627 --> 05:30.061
Bravo, Bobby, bravo.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.323
That's the best performance...

05:31.431 --> 05:35.834
since Michael Caine's ether-huffing
abortionist in The Cider House Rules,

05:36.736 --> 05:39.796
Bobby, I thought your father was
going to rehearse with you.

05:39.906 --> 05:40.930
It's okay.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.372
Mr. Gribble's an excellent acting coach.

05:43.476 --> 05:47.105
He's showing me how to channel
my disappointment in Dad into great art.

05:47.213 --> 05:48.475
[doorbell rings]

05:50.783 --> 05:51.875
Hey, dude.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.349
I mean, Mrs. Hill.

05:53.453 --> 05:55.478
Dale, your son is here for you.

05:55.588 --> 05:57.647
Actually, I came to see Mr. Hill.

05:57.757 --> 06:00.123
Okay, Joseph. Tryouts are coming up...

06:00.226 --> 06:02.421
so I made you a lacrosse goal.

06:02.528 --> 06:06.726
I used Bobby's stuffed-animal hammock
and the guardrail from his bed.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.361
(Dale) Let's go, Bobby. From the top.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.995
And, remember, smaller and realer.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.040
This isn't Guys aid Dolls,

06:16.442 --> 06:18.842
(Peggy) Hank, you are not Joseph's father.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.776
Dale is Joseph's father.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.008
Actually, John Redcorn is Joseph's father,
but Dale doesn't know that.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.642
The point is, you are only his godfather.

06:26.753 --> 06:31.281
You are not supposed to take over for Dale
until he is gunned down by federal agents.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.756
That is the agreement.

06:32.859 --> 06:36.420
I'm not taking over.
I'm just helping the boy make a team.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.692
If Bobby were trying out for a team,
I'd help him, too.

06:39.799 --> 06:42.063
You know very well
that is not gonna happen.

06:42.502 --> 06:43.730
[sighing] I know.

06:48.775 --> 06:51.266
(director) Two miiutes to curtaii,
Take your seats, please,

06:51.377 --> 06:54.005
Cai we have everybody sittiig dowi?
Thaik you,

06:54.113 --> 06:55.910
-Excuse me. Is that seat free?
-No.

06:56.015 --> 06:59.212
That seat is reserved for the father
of the star of the show.

06:59.318 --> 07:01.752
I am the stage mother, Peggy Hill.

07:02.288 --> 07:04.153
Please clear the aisle.

07:08.694 --> 07:11.686
Sorry. I had to stop by the bathroom
to throw up.

07:11.798 --> 07:14.028
Are you as nervous for Bobby as I am?

07:14.133 --> 07:17.660
Dale, if you want to make this
a competition, I will win.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.499
So, where's your better half?

07:19.605 --> 07:22.369
Well, he must be off
dealing with a propane emergency.

07:22.475 --> 07:25.672
As a propane wife,
you'd think I'd be used to it by now.

07:25.778 --> 07:26.870
But I am not.

07:35.354 --> 07:36.412
[kids screaming]

07:38.324 --> 07:40.952
-[whooping] Go, Joseph!
-Go, Joseph, go!

07:42.795 --> 07:43.887
Yeah!

07:44.530 --> 07:46.521
That's my neighbor's boy.

07:47.834 --> 07:48.926
Where's Dad?

07:49.035 --> 07:51.697
I was hoping he'd take
infrared footage of the game.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.863
I don't think he made it, sug'.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.999
Maybe he locked himself out of
or in something.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.814
Bobby, what a great performance.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.782
Your mother and I have
never been prouder of you.

08:05.885 --> 08:08.581
I just wish my dad had been there
to see it.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.451
He would have loved it.

08:10.556 --> 08:14.652
What you were doing with your hands
in that second scene...masterful.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.228
I don't know what to do with my hands
in real life.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.524
That's why I smoke.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.297
I solved the hand problem
back in high school when I was in Grease,

08:22.401 --> 08:24.164
I kept them in my pockets.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.397
I took them out only to hand jive.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.167
Dad?

08:31.310 --> 08:32.299
Bobby?

08:32.410 --> 08:34.174
-Dad?
-Joseph?

08:34.881 --> 08:36.849
[country music playing]

08:37.650 --> 08:38.912
[people chattering]

08:40.453 --> 08:42.318
Well, this is awkward.

08:44.090 --> 08:45.114
[moaning]

08:50.096 --> 08:51.654
Mind if I smoke?

08:54.734 --> 08:56.759
-Yep.
-Yep.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.559
[sighing]

08:58.671 --> 08:59.763
The play.

08:59.872 --> 09:03.535
We really stepped in it
and walked around the carpet this time.

09:03.643 --> 09:04.974
Poor Joseph.

09:05.077 --> 09:08.513
Can you send a 13-year-old boy
a bouquet of flowers?

09:08.614 --> 09:10.081
Is that appropriate?

09:10.182 --> 09:13.015
Well, if the boy is my boy, you can.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.184
Now, why am I knocking Bobby?

09:15.288 --> 09:17.586
We're the ones who are having trouble
with our kids...

09:17.690 --> 09:22.593
communicating the, you know,
the emotional whatnots.

09:22.762 --> 09:26.220
Sometimes I ask myself
why I even bother.

09:26.332 --> 09:29.165
I mean, it's not like Joseph's even my son.

09:29.535 --> 09:30.524
[coughs]

09:30.636 --> 09:32.126
What? That's crazy.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.865
Why would you say something like that?

09:33.973 --> 09:37.670
Now that Joseph's hit puberty,
the differences are impossible to ignore.

09:37.777 --> 09:40.541
We don't look alike,
we don't have the same interests.

09:40.646 --> 09:41.635
Come on.

09:41.747 --> 09:46.207
Sometimes I think the only thing Bobby
and I have in common is our waist size.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.877
True. But get this.

09:47.987 --> 09:52.481
I recently saw on the Discovery Channel
that it takes nine months to make a baby.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.459
Well, nine months before
Joseph was born...

09:55.561 --> 09:57.153
me and my reproductive organs...

09:57.263 --> 10:00.858
were 500 miles away in Marfa, Texas.

10:01.367 --> 10:05.667
For years, alien spaceships have appeared
in the skies above Marfa.

10:05.771 --> 10:10.208
The luiatic friige have dismissed
these so-called Marfa Lights,,,

10:10.309 --> 10:14.575
as swamp gas, experimeital aircraft
or weather balloois,

10:14.880 --> 10:18.646
So I weit oi a research trip
to debuik these wacko theories,

10:18.751 --> 10:21.743
Naicy had a horrible headache
aid couldi 't tra vel,,,

10:21.854 --> 10:25.950
so I asked John Redcorn to stay at
the house to protect her while I was gone.

10:26.058 --> 10:28.788
I thought I was being so smart...

10:28.894 --> 10:31.522
but I have never been so stupid.

10:31.764 --> 10:34.198
Oh, Dale, I'm so sorry.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.326
The truth has been right in front of me
all these years.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.734
-Joseph's real father is...
-Nancy loves you!

10:39.839 --> 10:41.704
...an alien!

10:42.274 --> 10:43.332
What?

10:43.442 --> 10:46.502
The aliens knew I was getting
too close to the truth.

10:46.612 --> 10:49.581
Exactly what truth, I have no idea.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.441
But I was close,

10:52.485 --> 10:55.147
They had to do somethiig to distract me,

10:58.190 --> 11:01.455
Aid what better way
thai a lifeloig distractioi?

11:01.560 --> 11:02.754
A child,

11:02.862 --> 11:07.799
So they impregiated Naicy
with their highly poteit space juice,

11:09.568 --> 11:12.833
As iefarious schemes oftei do, it worked,

11:13.139 --> 11:17.166
For the past 13 years, I ha ve beei too busy
raisiig ai alleged soi,,,

11:17.276 --> 11:19.767
to maiitaii coistait surveillaice,

11:20.046 --> 11:21.172
[screaming]

11:23.582 --> 11:26.813
I really don't think Joseph is an alien child.

11:26.919 --> 11:29.046
Well, I didn't impregnate Nancy.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.952
So who did, huh?

11:31.057 --> 11:33.218
You got a better explanation?

11:33.392 --> 11:34.950
[stuttering]

11:35.461 --> 11:37.725
Well, no.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.531
What other explanation could there be?

11:40.633 --> 11:42.533
Yep. Spacemen.

11:42.868 --> 11:43.857
Okay.

11:43.969 --> 11:46.335
So the reason why
I don't relate to my son...

11:46.439 --> 11:49.237
is that he is an extraterrestrial being.

11:49.341 --> 11:51.673
I don't know what your problem
with Bobby is.

11:51.777 --> 11:54.143
I guess you're just a crappy dad.

11:58.684 --> 11:59.651
(Hank) Bobby?

11:59.819 --> 12:02.310
I know how important
that play was to you.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.321
And it was wrong of me to miss it.

12:04.423 --> 12:07.950
I wouldn't do that to a customer,
and I shouldn't have done it to my son.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.324
So get used to this sound.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.722
Because I'll be doing a lot of that
at your next show.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.425
Well, that's very kind of you...

12:15.534 --> 12:19.493
but Mr. Sutter from the bank
got transferred to a branch in Durndle...

12:19.605 --> 12:21.903
so we have no idiot man-child.

12:22.007 --> 12:24.271
Therefore we have no show.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.105
Dang it! Dang it!

12:27.213 --> 12:29.306
I really wanted to see that show.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.043
I heard such good things
from your mother.

12:32.151 --> 12:33.914
Dang it! Oh, well.

12:34.019 --> 12:36.886
If you're that good
at pretending to be upset...

12:37.022 --> 12:40.287
maybe you might be good at pretending
to be a gentle giant...

12:40.392 --> 12:42.451
with the mind of a 5-year-old.

12:42.895 --> 12:44.920
Bobby, I'm no actor.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.931
Yeah. But can you at least act like a dad?

12:49.702 --> 12:52.034
I learned that from Mr. Gribble.

12:52.204 --> 12:54.001
But I should have learned it from you.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.266
[sniffling]

12:55.374 --> 12:57.604
Okay. I'll do it.

13:02.148 --> 13:03.775
[grunting]

13:06.619 --> 13:09.611
Joseph, I've got something
that we really need to....

13:09.722 --> 13:12.816
Could you stop doing that thing
where you lift the weights?

13:12.925 --> 13:14.449
What do you want?

13:14.560 --> 13:15.549
[sighing]

13:15.661 --> 13:18.687
This is the hardest conversation
I've ever had.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.223
Maybe I should just blurt it out.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.699
No, I'll pussyfoot around.

13:23.803 --> 13:27.500
Boy! This weather sure has been....
Joseph, you're an alien.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.073
What are you talking about?

13:29.175 --> 13:32.076
Creatures from outer space
impregnated your mother.

13:32.178 --> 13:35.079
-I am not your real father.
-Of course you are.

13:35.181 --> 13:38.150
Just because you're a spaz
at playing lacrosse, that doesn't mean--

13:38.250 --> 13:40.218
Come on! This is great news.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.651
For two humans, we get along terribly.

13:42.755 --> 13:46.555
But for two different species,
we're doing mediocre to good.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.183
This doesn't make any sense.

13:48.294 --> 13:51.127
You're telling me
I'm from outer space like E.T.?

13:51.230 --> 13:52.663
Actually, no.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.359
He was a purebred alien
and had a heart of gold.

13:55.467 --> 13:59.233
You're only half-alien
and at times can be a tad self-absorbed.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.899
You missed my damn tryouts
and now you're calling me self-absorbed?

14:03.008 --> 14:05.568
Oh, God! I have displeased you.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.408
Okay, I'll double, no, triple your allowance.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.812
And when your people return
to wipe out the human race...

14:10.916 --> 14:13.646
maybe you can convince them
to spare our lives.

14:13.752 --> 14:16.380
Your mother's sturdy.
She can work in the mines.

14:16.488 --> 14:19.184
And me? Well, I'd make an excellent pet.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.730
(Bobby) ""And when we put in a crop...

14:27.833 --> 14:30.495
""why, we'd be there to take that crop up.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.094
""We'd know what come of our planting.

14:33.439 --> 14:34.906
""And rabbits.""

14:35.040 --> 14:39.101
""You'd fill up the sack and bring it in
and put it in the rabbit cages.""

14:39.211 --> 14:42.408
""They'd nibble and they'd nibble
the way they do.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.072
""I've seen them.""

14:45.551 --> 14:48.213
We're really good together, Dad.

14:48.420 --> 14:51.321
Hey, let's practice our bows. You go first.

14:53.492 --> 14:56.290
Yeah, Dad! Bravo!

14:58.330 --> 15:00.093
Mom, have you got a minute?

15:00.199 --> 15:01.564
What's up, little sug'?

15:01.667 --> 15:03.760
-ls Dad my real dad?
-What?

15:04.236 --> 15:05.260
Of course he is.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.430
Why would you say something like that?
He's your dad.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.564
He's your dad. Okay?
He's your dad. Okay?

15:09.675 --> 15:11.074
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:15.814 --> 15:17.042
(Joseph) Well, she was scared, Bobby.

15:17.149 --> 15:19.083
The kind of scared you only see
in Earth women...

15:19.184 --> 15:21.584
who've given birth
to half-human/half-alien babies.

15:21.687 --> 15:23.951
Joseph, you are not an alien.

15:24.056 --> 15:25.284
You're being crazy.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.086
I knew you were gonna say that.

15:27.192 --> 15:29.160
Oh, no! I have ESP.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.489
What's happening to me?

15:30.596 --> 15:31.620
[grunting]

15:31.730 --> 15:34.255
Greetings, Your Alien Excellency.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.033
I bought you a brand new TV.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.229
No reason. Just because.

15:39.338 --> 15:40.464
Enjoy.

15:42.074 --> 15:43.132
He's just being nice...

15:43.242 --> 15:46.370
so my real dad won't freeze him
in carbonite and trade him for spice.

15:46.478 --> 15:48.503
It's not like he really wants me here.

15:49.381 --> 15:50.643
Where are you going?

15:50.749 --> 15:52.808
I'm tired of being a freak.

15:52.918 --> 15:55.148
I need to go and live among my own kind.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.745
I need to go home.

16:00.759 --> 16:01.851
Places, everyone.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.622
Hold on. Where's Bobby?

16:03.729 --> 16:05.594
Well, I thought he was with you.

16:05.698 --> 16:09.156
No. I had to come early for body makeup.

16:09.368 --> 16:12.462
Oh, no! Where am I gonna find a George
at the last minute?

16:12.571 --> 16:14.061
-I'll do it.
-Wait a minute.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.141
I was just doing this for my son.

16:16.241 --> 16:18.368
If he's not here, I resign my part.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.206
Hank, the show must go on.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.304
We have a roomful of seniors
from Garrity and Sons nursing home.

16:23.415 --> 16:26.282
And we may have told them
this was Broadway.

16:26.385 --> 16:28.376
I don't want them to be disappointed.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.476
But, l....

16:33.792 --> 16:37.558
Lennie, for God's sake,
don't drink so much.

16:40.065 --> 16:41.089
That's good.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.134
You drink some, George.

16:43.235 --> 16:44.668
You drink some, too.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.738
I ain't sure it's good water.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.898
Looks kind of scummy to me.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.632
That line could be better.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.438
Who wrote this crap?

16:53.045 --> 16:54.910
This is not like Bobby.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.847
He was so excited
about doing the play with you.

16:57.950 --> 17:01.545
Is it possible he got a better part
in another play?

17:01.854 --> 17:02.912
[sighs] That little....

17:03.022 --> 17:05.957
If he wanted to make his old man
look like a jackass...

17:06.058 --> 17:08.219
well, he finally did something right.

17:09.661 --> 17:12.060
-The alien has escaped!
-What?

17:12.164 --> 17:14.791
Joseph. He's gone to Marfa,
and he's taken Bobby with him.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.333
Probably as food.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.061
That UFO place?

17:18.337 --> 17:19.702
Oh, God!

17:19.972 --> 17:23.738
And, FYl, Boomhauer said
he could see your nipples on stage.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.036
Let's go!

17:38.657 --> 17:39.624
[moaning]

17:41.393 --> 17:44.385
I hope my alien dad loves me
more than my real dad.

17:44.496 --> 17:46.123
So, what happens now?

17:46.231 --> 17:48.665
A flying saucer drops out of the sky...

17:48.767 --> 17:52.168
some little green man
in a tinfoil jumpsuit says, ""Gleep glop""...

17:52.271 --> 17:55.832
and you say, ""Bleep bloop,""
and then you live happily ever after?

17:55.941 --> 17:58.000
It's not gonna happen.

17:58.343 --> 18:00.106
Dude, he's coming.

18:01.547 --> 18:05.210
Damn it, Dale. Why'd you have to tell
Joseph he was an alien?

18:05.451 --> 18:07.009
It's the truth, isn't it?

18:07.786 --> 18:11.415
Well, sometimes it's better
to keep the truth from someone.

18:11.523 --> 18:14.856
Especially if, you know,
they can't deal with it.

18:14.993 --> 18:18.895
I felt the same way when Boomhauer
told me I had bad breath.

18:19.031 --> 18:22.125
But since then I've learned to inhale
while I talk.

18:24.236 --> 18:25.828
Oh, it's getting cold.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.304
Now, I'm not saying we're wasting time...

18:28.407 --> 18:32.571
because this is great people-watching,
but I'm about ready to go.

18:35.147 --> 18:38.048
How is my dad's tractor beam
gonna be able to lock in on me...

18:38.150 --> 18:40.345
if I'm blending in with all these idiots?

18:43.055 --> 18:45.751
Joseph, no stupid UFOs are coming.

18:45.858 --> 18:49.089
The only lights we're gonna see
are the lights of an ambulance...

18:49.194 --> 18:52.891
when they come to pick
our cold, dead bodies off the ground!

18:52.998 --> 18:54.625
[panting]

18:58.570 --> 18:59.537
[groaning]

19:00.772 --> 19:03.969
That's Don Hood,
the country's top UFO hunter.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.237
He's been abducted three times.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.971
And that's Duke Greenroy. He's crazy.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.106
Excuse me, friends.

19:11.216 --> 19:14.481
Would either of you be interested
in purchasing some alien urine?

19:14.586 --> 19:17.214
-How much?
-Half a mayonnaise jar.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.716
Hank, you have half a mayonnaise jar?

19:20.826 --> 19:24.318
Dale, the temperature's dropping.
We gotta find these kids soon.

19:24.429 --> 19:27.455
Hey, buddy, have you seen
two 13-year-old boys?

19:27.566 --> 19:29.466
One of them half-alien.

19:29.568 --> 19:33.095
Well, I saw one kid wander out
into the desert with his lndian guide.

19:33.205 --> 19:36.265
-Oh, God!
-Well, thanks anyway.

19:37.442 --> 19:39.307
Hey, do you take Diners Club?

19:42.447 --> 19:43.937
(Hank) Bobby? Joseph?

19:44.616 --> 19:47.744
Would you put the jar down
and help me look for the kids?

19:47.853 --> 19:49.912
I can't believe I lost Joseph.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.718
I hope his real dad doesn't eat my brain.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.314
But, of course, he will.

19:54.426 --> 19:57.327
-Damn it, Dale. You're his real dad.
-No, I'm not.

19:57.429 --> 20:00.159
When Joseph was a baby,
who changed his diapers?

20:00.265 --> 20:02.756
-You or some alien?
-I did.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.859
Who took him to his first day
at kindergarten?

20:04.970 --> 20:05.994
I did.

20:06.104 --> 20:09.403
-Who taught him how to tie his shoes?
-John Redcorn.

20:09.942 --> 20:12.536
Well, okay.
But who taught him how to ride a bike?

20:12.644 --> 20:13.838
John Redcorn.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.642
He taught Joseph and Joseph taught me.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.910
Okay. But I didn't see
the aliens doing that stuff.

20:20.018 --> 20:24.079
But you were there for every
Christmas morning and scraped knee.

20:24.189 --> 20:25.520
You, Dale.

20:25.624 --> 20:29.822
Any alien can inject someone
with his space juice and be a father.

20:29.928 --> 20:32.453
But it takes a real man to be a dad.

20:34.199 --> 20:35.564
(woman) Oh, my God!

20:35.667 --> 20:37.658
They're here.

20:37.803 --> 20:41.796
-Oh, my God! The Marfa Lights!
-It's the boys.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.474
-Joseph, your dad's here.
-I know.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.600
I'm scared.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.975
No, your Earth dad.

20:48.380 --> 20:51.008
-Dad!
-Don't go, son!

20:51.116 --> 20:52.276
I don't want to go.

20:52.384 --> 20:53.408
(Dale) Then run.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.349
Run away from the light.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.021
-Joseph!
-Dad!

20:58.123 --> 20:59.249
Joseph.

21:01.593 --> 21:05.427
You can't have him. He's my son!

21:07.232 --> 21:08.790
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

21:11.236 --> 21:14.330
Dad, aliens impregnated Mom.
That's a given.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.873
But isn't it possible that
first they abducted you...

21:16.975 --> 21:20.911
stole your genetic material,
and then used that to create me?

21:21.179 --> 21:23.477
Recovering. Recovering.

21:23.582 --> 21:26.949
Recovered memory.
That's exactly how it went down.

21:27.052 --> 21:30.453
Which means you are
my flesh-and-blood genetic son.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.751
Sorry I missed your play, Dad.

21:35.861 --> 21:37.192
It's all right, son.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.697
I guess you had your own
idiot man-child to deal with.

21:40.799 --> 21:44.030
Yeah. That Joseph, he's really....

21:44.770 --> 21:47.432
-Really like his dad.
-Yep.

21:47.539 --> 21:50.599
Those Gribbles are two nuts
on the same sundae.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.844
-Yep,
-Yep,

22:28.347 --> 22:30.907
-Hey, Dad, what's ii the jar?
-Doi 't driik it,
