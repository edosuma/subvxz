It shouldn't frighten you.

00:28.827 --> 00:32.039
I'm sorry. Nothing until
matinee tomorrow.

00:43.216 --> 00:45.009
Lady,
would ya mind takin' off your hat?

00:45.134 --> 00:46.344
Excuse me.

00:58.313 --> 01:00.732
Atta girl, Janey. Show 'em how!

01:27.633 --> 01:30.510
Oh, thank you, folks.
Thank you very much, thank you...

01:32.846 --> 01:34.514
One final request, all right?

01:42.312 --> 01:43.939
"I've Written a Letter to Daddy!"

01:44.606 --> 01:46.817
All right, thank you.

01:47.610 --> 01:49.528
"I've Written a Letter to Daddy."

02:07.503 --> 02:13.134
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

02:14.218 --> 02:19.431
"His address is heaven above.

02:20.432 --> 02:26.104
"I've written, Dear Daddy,
we miss you...

02:26.813 --> 02:32.402
"...and wish you were with us to love.

02:33.319 --> 02:38.115
"Instead of a stamp I put kisses.

02:39.742 --> 02:45.413
"The postman says that's best to do.

02:46.206 --> 02:50.918
"I've written this letter to Daddy...

02:51.502 --> 02:57.424
"...saying, I love you.

03:19.905 --> 03:25.034
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

03:25.618 --> 03:32.499
"...saying, I love you!"

03:50.434 --> 03:51.810
Well, what do you have here?

03:52.728 --> 03:53.812
All for you.

03:54.104 --> 03:56.314
Jane, isn't that a beautiful doll?

03:56.606 --> 03:58.399
Thank you, young man,
that's a gorgeous doll!

03:58.608 --> 04:01.819
Folks, have you ever seen
such a lovely doll?

04:13.705 --> 04:15.915
Don't forget, there's a genuine...

04:15.998 --> 04:18.834
...Baby Jane doll waiting for each and
every one of you right out in the foyer.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.920
All you have to do is go out there
and collect it. And kids, remember...

04:22.129 --> 04:24.923
...you can tell your moms that
each and everyone of these...

04:25.133 --> 04:27.218
...genuine, beautiful, great
big dolls...

04:27.510 --> 04:31.597
...is an exact replica of your own
Baby Jane Hudson.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.894
Baby Jane dolls.
Only $3.25.

04:52.033 --> 04:55.119
I won't, I don't wanna
go back to that ol' hotel!

04:55.494 --> 04:58.121
I don't have to take a nap
and you can't make me!

04:58.205 --> 04:59.706
Now, Jane, don't act up, sweetheart.

04:59.831 --> 05:01.499
You've got to take your nap.
You know that.

05:01.624 --> 05:04.127
No, I don't know and I'm not going to!

05:05.129 --> 05:07.214
You don't want all these
nice friends of yours out here...

05:07.297 --> 05:09.424
...to think that you're
a bad little girl, do ya?

05:09.424 --> 05:12.427
I don't care! I want an ice cream!

05:12.510 --> 05:14.804
Janey, I told you...

05:14.804 --> 05:18.015
I make the money,
so I can have what I want!

05:19.516 --> 05:21.226
Leave me alone! I need an ice cream!

05:23.395 --> 05:24.896
Well, if you need an ice cream...

05:25.397 --> 05:26.898
...I guess you better have some.

05:27.023 --> 05:28.817
I mean, it's pretty hot and all.

05:29.026 --> 05:31.320
But remember, this is
the last time this week.

05:31.820 --> 05:35.615
All right, Daddy.
Blanche wants some, too.

05:35.907 --> 05:37.700
We gotta have some
ice cream for Blanche.

05:40.495 --> 05:41.912
I don't want anything.

05:42.329 --> 05:44.123
What do you think you're tryin' to do?!

05:44.416 --> 05:47.001
I always said it's the parents' fault
in cases like this.

05:47.418 --> 05:49.003
I'm really disappointed!

05:49.629 --> 05:52.006
It sure is a hot day today.

06:06.102 --> 06:08.604
You're the lucky one, though,
Blanche, really you are.

06:08.896 --> 06:11.690
Someday it's going to be you
that's getting all the attention.

06:12.024 --> 06:13.525
And when that happens, I...

06:15.527 --> 06:17.822
...I want you to try to be kinder
to Jane and your father...

06:17.905 --> 06:19.907
...than they are to you now.

06:21.992 --> 06:23.493
You know what I mean?

06:27.122 --> 06:29.708
I hope you'll try'n remember that.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.627
I won't forget.

06:33.003 --> 06:35.296
You bet I won't forget!

06:42.386 --> 06:43.887
The Seltzer Agency sent you?

06:44.888 --> 06:46.723
Think there's any chance for me?

06:46.807 --> 06:49.392
There's a chance if Mr. Weber likes you.

06:49.893 --> 06:51.686
What type does he like?

06:53.813 --> 06:55.189
A lot of personality.

06:56.190 --> 06:58.692
I'll catch on, watch me.

07:01.195 --> 07:03.196
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

07:06.118 --> 07:09.120
With my money
I should make a picture like that, huh?

07:12.415 --> 07:14.625
Good morning, Mr. Weber.
I'm Ms. Brent.

07:14.709 --> 07:17.002
Yes. Won't you come a little closer,
please?

07:17.086 --> 07:20.088
She's got a southern accent
like I got a southern accent.

07:25.010 --> 07:28.221
I know it's 11:00!
I'll be there when I get there!

07:32.391 --> 07:33.892
Gardner is here to see you.

07:34.101 --> 07:36.103
Gardner?

07:36.186 --> 07:37.187
I'll come out.

07:38.313 --> 07:40.023
I'll be right back, Ms. Brent.

07:40.023 --> 07:41.816
Have yourself a cigarette.

07:41.900 --> 07:42.984
Make yourself at home.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.611
Then the job is mine?

07:44.987 --> 07:46.196
Need you ask?

08:24.399 --> 08:25.400
Kill it!

08:29.195 --> 08:31.113
What do you think, Ben?

08:31.697 --> 08:34.116
What's thinking got to do with it, huh?

08:34.991 --> 08:37.119
She stinks, doesn't she?

08:37.910 --> 08:41.081
They say the end's pretty good.
Maybe we should've seen it through.

08:42.914 --> 08:45.502
You gonna want that picture
again today, Mr. Feldman?

08:47.504 --> 08:51.591
I don't think anybody's ever gonna want
that picture again!

08:58.389 --> 09:00.599
When the old man hired them
Hudson sisters...

09:00.891 --> 09:03.394
...how come he had to hire
the back end of the act, too?

09:03.603 --> 09:06.188
Boy, what a no-talent broad
that Baby Jane is!

09:06.480 --> 09:08.816
Why can't she stay sober?

09:10.317 --> 09:13.278
Jane's got her pride.
She's a very sensitive girl.

09:13.612 --> 09:17.115
Your "very sensitive girl" guzzled
her way through six cases of Scotch...

09:17.407 --> 09:18.908
...and slugged two studio cops.

09:18.991 --> 09:22.286
Not to mention one or two other
less savory items of publicity...

09:22.578 --> 09:24.580
...before we got that so-called
epic in the can.

09:24.913 --> 09:26.582
Anyway, you don't have to talk to Jane.

09:26.915 --> 09:29.209
If Blanche will only let us out
of that clause in the contract...

09:29.209 --> 09:31.503
...which says that we have to make
a picture with Baby Jane...

09:31.586 --> 09:33.379
...for every picture that we make
with Blanche.

09:33.504 --> 09:35.591
Then Baby Jane's contract
won't be any problem.

09:35.882 --> 09:37.801
You see, that's what we pay lawyers for.

09:37.884 --> 09:38.802
Possibly.

09:39.010 --> 09:42.180
But somehow,
I can't see Blanche doing that.

09:42.389 --> 09:43.515
You know, I don't get it!

09:43.599 --> 09:45.517
Blanche Hudson's the biggest thing
in movies today.

09:45.684 --> 09:48.186
She can write her own ticket.
She's got a script approval.

09:48.395 --> 09:50.813
She's got more money than she knows
what to do with...

09:52.190 --> 09:55.901
You know, she just bought that
tremendous place Valentino used to have.

09:55.901 --> 09:57.278
It's gonna take her a year
to fix it up...

09:57.486 --> 09:59.905
...the way she wants it
before they move in.

10:00.113 --> 10:03.491
Well I guess they can manage
to struggle on where they are now.

10:03.575 --> 10:05.702
But, my point is she ought to have
sense enough to know that...

10:05.785 --> 10:09.497
...she can't make a star
out of Baby Jane again.

10:09.580 --> 10:12.708
Blanche doesn't have
any illusions like that.

10:13.375 --> 10:16.587
But she's a very fine person, Ben.

10:16.878 --> 10:19.005
She's never gonna forget
those early years.

10:19.297 --> 10:21.299
What her sister did for her.
She told me that herself.

10:21.382 --> 10:25.388
Well, I tell you, she's not doin'
Baby Jane any favor.

10:25.597 --> 10:28.599
Someday, sooner or later,
that girl's gonna end up in a home.

10:30.976 --> 10:33.312
Look, you're going to their party
at the Grove tonight, aren't you?

10:33.896 --> 10:37.190
Did you ever try refusing
one of Blanche's invitations?

10:37.482 --> 10:39.776
Do me a favor, Marty, will ya?
You talk to Blanche.

10:40.110 --> 10:42.111
Try to make her understand, huh?

10:42.779 --> 10:44.488
- Do my best.
- Thanks...

10:46.282 --> 10:48.575
Remind me to send you
one of those...

10:48.701 --> 10:51.078
...Baby Jane dolls for Christmas.

10:52.204 --> 10:54.205
I've got mine for this year.

10:56.082 --> 10:58.001
I don't get it, Marty.

10:58.501 --> 11:00.670
What do they make monsters
like this for?

11:01.003 --> 11:02.797
For Blanche Hudson.

11:06.384 --> 11:08.594
That's our problem.

14:57.976 --> 14:59.686
You go to bed!

15:08.987 --> 15:11.072
- Hi, Mom!
- Oh, hi, dear.

15:24.085 --> 15:25.377
Hello, beautiful!
How 'bout a little souvenir?

15:25.377 --> 15:26.795
Let go of that, will ya, let go!

15:27.254 --> 15:29.590
Come on, don't be like that.
Who do you think you are?

15:32.968 --> 15:33.968
Thanks.

15:40.684 --> 15:42.560
Isn't she great?

15:43.895 --> 15:47.190
Sorry to break in on this fine old
Blanche Hudson movie, folks.

15:47.481 --> 15:48.983
But you'll be glad I did...

15:49.066 --> 15:50.776
...when you see what I have
right here...

15:50.860 --> 15:53.070
...for that favorite pooch of yours.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.655
And Iliad means quality.

15:55.280 --> 15:59.075
So when your dog says, "woof woof"...

15:59.075 --> 16:00.952
...feed him Iliad,
the classic dog food.

16:00.952 --> 16:02.286
Oh, shut up!

16:02.787 --> 16:04.372
Iliad will bring the sheen
back to your dog's coat...

16:04.455 --> 16:07.583
Oh, my goodness, I remember
the first time I saw that picture.

16:07.791 --> 16:10.169
I thought it was just wonderful.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.462
When was that?

16:12.088 --> 16:16.258
Let's see now, as I recall, your father
took me to see it at the old Majestic.

16:16.467 --> 16:18.385
It was before we were married.

16:18.677 --> 16:22.181
She must be about 150 by now!

16:23.766 --> 16:25.768
As a matter of fact, dear,
I think Blanche Hudson is...

16:25.851 --> 16:27.561
...just a few years older than I am.

16:28.353 --> 16:29.187
Really?!

16:29.271 --> 16:31.356
Yes, dear, "really."

16:31.690 --> 16:33.983
Well, how come
we never see her around?

16:34.359 --> 16:36.986
We've been living next door to them
for six months now...

16:37.153 --> 16:40.489
...and the only one I ever see
is that fat sister slouching around.

16:40.656 --> 16:42.658
Don't they ever have company?

16:42.866 --> 16:44.284
I mean it must be awful.

16:44.576 --> 16:48.872
You know, Julie says
that sister's kind of peculiar.

16:49.164 --> 16:50.456
Did you ever notice that?

16:50.748 --> 16:52.375
No, I never have.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.669
Well, that's what Julie told me.

16:54.752 --> 16:57.380
She said that she was supposed
to be responsible for the accident...

16:57.589 --> 16:59.758
...that crippled her sister Blanche.

17:00.050 --> 17:02.970
That all happened
a very long time ago, dear.

17:03.053 --> 17:04.762
And maybe you shouldn't
pay too much attention...

17:04.887 --> 17:06.181
...to everything that Julie Fowler
tells you.

17:06.263 --> 17:08.974
There's too many people in this town
with nothing else to do but talk.

17:09.267 --> 17:12.353
Maybe so, but Julie's folks
have lived here a long time.

17:12.561 --> 17:14.063
I guess she should know.

17:14.355 --> 17:17.066
Turn up the volume, dear.
We're missing the picture.

17:18.983 --> 17:21.278
- Will you have a little champagne?
- No, thank you.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.449
You wanna tell Poppa your troubles?

17:27.950 --> 17:29.285
Somebody you love?

17:30.161 --> 17:33.163
Oh, Jack, please try to understand.

17:33.455 --> 17:34.957
I married you because...

17:35.248 --> 17:38.461
...I was knocked silly
and it was a refuge.

17:39.753 --> 17:43.674
I found out tonight that this boy's
in trouble, maybe alone.

17:44.257 --> 17:46.051
It's blinding me.

17:46.551 --> 17:48.471
I can't think of anything else...

17:50.764 --> 17:52.349
Oh! He should've held that shot...

17:52.474 --> 17:53.475
...Ionger.

17:53.850 --> 17:57.479
I told him that when we were rehearsing,
also when it was shot!

17:57.771 --> 17:58.855
But he wouldn't listen!

18:06.153 --> 18:08.447
- Hiya?
- Swell.

18:10.365 --> 18:12.659
It's still a pretty good picture.

18:14.869 --> 18:17.079
...and Gemini...

18:57.659 --> 19:00.079
Tommy, you don't have to stay here,
do you?

19:01.664 --> 19:03.457
I'll just sit here.

19:05.042 --> 19:07.169
Enjoying yourself?

19:07.461 --> 19:09.671
Jane, what are you doing?

19:11.464 --> 19:12.757
I was watching!

19:14.175 --> 19:15.176
Then you're an idiot!

19:15.843 --> 19:18.554
I won't have you speak to me like that!

19:27.855 --> 19:29.648
Ah, the poor thing!

19:31.150 --> 19:33.568
Poor baby.

19:36.571 --> 19:38.365
Quiet down.

20:01.344 --> 20:04.472
Oh, good morning, Ms. Hudson.
I hope I'm not intruding.

20:04.973 --> 20:07.350
I just couldn't resist cutting
these flowers for your sister...

20:07.558 --> 20:09.769
...after seeing her show yesterday.

20:10.769 --> 20:13.063
You must be very proud
of her new success...

20:13.355 --> 20:15.149
...on television, I mean.

20:17.861 --> 20:19.446
I can't tell you how nice it is...

20:19.571 --> 20:21.948
...to be seeing all of
her old pictures like this.

20:22.574 --> 20:24.075
I'll tell 'er you said so.

20:25.660 --> 20:29.747
You know, my daughter and I
would just love to meet her one day.

20:29.872 --> 20:30.873
Perhaps she could...

20:31.457 --> 20:33.250
Mrs. Bates,
my sister doesn't ever go out.

20:33.375 --> 20:36.461
She's not fit to receive visitors.

20:37.045 --> 20:39.255
Oh, I am sorry to hear that.

20:39.756 --> 20:41.841
I'd no idea that, well...

20:44.969 --> 20:47.346
I hope she likes the flowers.

20:51.266 --> 20:52.642
Thanks.

21:16.061 --> 21:18.647
You miserable...

22:00.519 --> 22:01.520
Oh, Jane, I'm sorry.

22:01.729 --> 22:03.730
I didn't mean to ring for my breakfast.

22:04.148 --> 22:06.733
I was just wondering who all those
people were at the back door.

22:07.234 --> 22:09.027
Wasn't anything.

22:09.319 --> 22:12.947
Just that nosey Mrs. Bates going on
about your picture last night.

22:13.823 --> 22:16.033
Oh, really? Did she like it?

22:16.618 --> 22:19.329
Oh, really? Did she like it?

22:21.748 --> 22:23.624
She liked it.

22:26.335 --> 22:28.337
I remember, when it first came out...

22:28.545 --> 22:31.048
...it had a tremendous reception.

22:31.757 --> 22:35.343
The critics described it as... brilliant!

22:36.135 --> 22:39.138
Do you remember what year
you made that picture?

22:40.639 --> 22:43.852
Well, of course, you must, too.
In 1934, right after I did "Moonglow."

22:44.352 --> 22:46.854
I made a picture that year, too!

22:47.855 --> 22:51.525
Oh, yes, it was that comedy
directed by Lloyd, wasn't it?

22:52.234 --> 22:54.319
No, it wasn't. It was a love story.

22:54.528 --> 22:55.947
"The Longest Night."

22:56.239 --> 22:58.449
Marty McDonald said
it was the best thing I ever did!

23:00.034 --> 23:03.120
They never even released it
in the United States!

23:04.621 --> 23:05.914
Feldman was very upset.

23:06.039 --> 23:07.540
He told me the company had...

23:07.624 --> 23:09.417
...a very bad year and
they couldn't afford...

23:09.417 --> 23:10.543
No, they didn't!
They had a great year!

23:10.627 --> 23:12.336
They didn't want to show my films.

23:13.045 --> 23:15.339
They were too busy
giving a "big build-up"...

23:15.548 --> 23:18.050
...to that crap you were turning out.

23:21.928 --> 23:23.013
I'll clean the cage.

23:26.933 --> 23:28.226
Oh, that would be Elvira.

24:02.425 --> 24:03.551
Come in, Elvira!

24:05.636 --> 24:07.930
- How are you today?
- Fine.

24:08.722 --> 24:10.515
Oh, you've seen Jane.

24:12.726 --> 24:14.811
I don't think she's feeling
very well today.

24:15.019 --> 24:18.440
Did you speak to that Dr. Shelby
about Ms. Jane like you said?

24:19.024 --> 24:21.944
No, I haven't yet.
It's rather difficult.

24:22.111 --> 24:24.613
I don't want to upset her again,
if I can help it.

24:24.947 --> 24:26.740
But she'll be upset anyway,
Ms. Blanche.

24:26.949 --> 24:29.826
And the longer you leave it,
the worse it's gonna be.

24:30.619 --> 24:31.620
I know.

24:32.621 --> 24:35.540
But I was just hoping
it wouldn't be necessary.

24:36.040 --> 24:38.542
I think she seems much better lately.

24:38.834 --> 24:40.211
It's none of my business...

24:40.336 --> 24:42.713
...but she's been drinkin' again.
You know that, don't ya?

24:42.921 --> 24:44.923
No, I hadn't noticed.

24:46.633 --> 24:49.135
Oh, I don't think
it does her any real harm.

24:49.344 --> 24:51.346
I think I understand her.

24:51.638 --> 24:52.722
Oh, you do, huh?

24:53.014 --> 24:55.142
Well, then, you ought
to take a look at this.

24:59.729 --> 25:00.813
What are these?

25:00.938 --> 25:02.940
I guess it's what you'd call fan mail.

25:05.234 --> 25:08.529
Oh, how kind people are.

25:09.238 --> 25:10.406
You better look at them...

25:10.406 --> 25:13.826
...and then you can tell me
whether or not you've seen them before.

25:14.243 --> 25:15.828
- Did you read that?
- No.

25:16.912 --> 25:18.122
But they've been opened.

25:18.247 --> 25:19.831
That's right, they all have.

25:20.123 --> 25:22.917
And there's one in here
marked "Personal."

25:29.632 --> 25:33.510
"The other night my husband and I
watched that lovely movie of yours...

25:33.844 --> 25:34.929
"...'Last Honeymoon.'

25:35.138 --> 25:38.140
"I remember saying to my husband
at the time that seeing you again...

25:38.224 --> 25:40.434
"...was just like
meeting an old friend."

25:41.518 --> 25:44.813
Oh, that's charming.
That's really charming!

25:45.105 --> 25:47.732
The point is, you never
saw them before, did you?

25:51.611 --> 25:53.321
I thought not.

25:54.238 --> 25:57.116
I'm sorry, I thought you ought to know.

25:57.741 --> 26:00.536
But, I don't understand.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.914
Where'd they come from?
Where'd you find them?

26:03.205 --> 26:05.124
In the trash barrel, that's where!

26:05.332 --> 26:06.834
They're from that television station...

26:06.917 --> 26:08.919
...that's been running
your old movies, aren't they?

26:17.803 --> 26:19.304
You mean Jane?

26:19.638 --> 26:21.514
Who else?

26:22.807 --> 26:25.226
Oh, well, she must have thought
they were advertisements.

26:25.435 --> 26:27.728
Then why would she open
the one marked "Personal"?

26:27.937 --> 26:30.940
And what about this?
You might as well see this, too.

26:32.816 --> 26:34.526
Writing those dirty words!

26:34.818 --> 26:39.030
I can even remember the last time
I saw words like that written down!

26:39.614 --> 26:41.616
But, why would she do a thing like this?

26:42.033 --> 26:44.118
You know what makes her
do things like this!

26:44.327 --> 26:47.538
She's sick, and she's not
getting any better.

26:48.205 --> 26:50.625
In fact, the last month
she's been getting a lot worse.

26:53.711 --> 26:55.130
If you don't believe me, then...

26:55.213 --> 26:58.133
...why are you selling this house
and planning to move out?

26:58.508 --> 27:00.510
You said this last month...

27:01.219 --> 27:02.928
...she's been a lot worse.

27:03.721 --> 27:05.014
Do you think she knows?

27:05.306 --> 27:06.724
About selling the house?

27:07.099 --> 27:10.602
How could she?
You don't have anything in writing.

27:11.228 --> 27:13.313
We're sisters, Elvira.

27:13.938 --> 27:15.523
We know each other very well.

27:15.606 --> 27:16.607
I think she's jealous...

27:16.732 --> 27:20.611
...because of those old movies of yours
they're showing on television this week.

27:21.111 --> 27:23.530
Anyway, in six weeks you'll have to
hand over the house and then...

27:23.697 --> 27:25.407
...she'll have to know.

27:27.117 --> 27:28.326
How do I tell her?

27:28.535 --> 27:29.202
How?!

27:30.328 --> 27:34.416
Well, if you'd just speak to that
Dr. Shelby, maybe he could tell her.

27:40.130 --> 27:42.216
No, it ought to be me.

27:44.509 --> 27:46.720
I can't let a stranger tell her.

27:47.012 --> 27:50.598
But he's a doctor, Ms. Blanche.
And she's a sick woman.

27:51.432 --> 27:55.519
Elvira, you didn't know her
when she was a child.

27:56.312 --> 27:57.229
When she was young.

27:57.396 --> 28:00.232
I've seen those pictures she keeps.

28:01.608 --> 28:05.028
It wasn't that she was just pretty.

28:05.820 --> 28:07.613
She was different.

28:07.697 --> 28:09.407
She was so alive.

28:15.913 --> 28:18.124
I was cleaning the cage.

28:18.833 --> 28:20.000
The bird got out.

28:21.418 --> 28:22.794
But where is it now?

28:23.295 --> 28:25.130
It flew out the window.

28:26.214 --> 28:28.801
You let that bird out
on purpose, Ms. Jane!

28:29.218 --> 28:34.014
I just told ya, I was cleaning the cage
and the bird flew out the window.

28:36.099 --> 28:37.434
I'm sorry!

28:38.226 --> 28:42.230
She did that on purpose!
Believe me, she did it on purpose!

28:42.521 --> 28:43.814
Never mind.

28:44.607 --> 28:46.025
Maybe he'll come back.

29:00.830 --> 29:02.415
You won't change your mind, will you?

29:02.499 --> 29:04.209
I mean about coming to live with me?

29:04.292 --> 29:06.711
You know I don't go back
on my word, Ms. Blanche.

29:07.003 --> 29:10.130
But you've got to make up your mind
about finding somewhere for Ms. Jane...

29:10.297 --> 29:12.716
...where they can
look after her properly.

29:16.219 --> 29:18.097
I have made up my mind.

29:18.806 --> 29:21.100
I'm going to call Dr. Shelby today.

29:31.609 --> 29:33.612
I know, Ms. Blanche, I know.

29:37.198 --> 29:38.825
It's just that I have to be sure...

29:38.908 --> 29:40.827
...I'm doing the right thing for her.

30:07.518 --> 30:09.019
Hello, is this Johnson's?

30:09.895 --> 30:12.398
I want to order some liquor.
It's Jane Hudson.

30:15.026 --> 30:17.903
Waddaya mean you can't fill
any more orders for me?

30:18.696 --> 30:20.406
My sister did?

30:26.828 --> 30:30.415
Well, wait a minute,
I'll put 'er on.

30:32.792 --> 30:37.087
Blanche, would you speak
to this man from Johnson's?

30:42.801 --> 30:45.386
Hello, who is this, please?

30:47.388 --> 30:50.599
Oh, yes, Mr. Carlston.

30:50.724 --> 30:53.603
Yes, this is Blanche Hudson.
What seems to be the trouble?

30:58.191 --> 31:01.403
I'm afraid there's been some
misunderstanding.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.488
I certainly didn't mean to suggest...

31:03.821 --> 31:06.699
...that you shouldn't fill
any orders for her.

31:08.993 --> 31:11.411
After all, we do pay
our bills, don't we?

31:15.624 --> 31:17.417
Yes, fine.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.419
Would you please?

31:22.296 --> 31:24.298
I'll put her on.

31:30.011 --> 31:31.597
Okay, then?

31:32.598 --> 31:33.307
Good...

31:33.307 --> 31:37.811
...I'd like to order six bottles
of Scotch and three bottles of gin.

31:38.520 --> 31:42.315
The same brands,
and as soon as possible.

31:51.282 --> 31:56.120
I just told Ms. Blanche. I'm going
downtown to see a man about jury duty.

32:02.501 --> 32:04.294
I'll be back tomorrow.

33:16.403 --> 33:20.782
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

33:23.285 --> 33:26.997
"His address is heaven above.

33:29.791 --> 33:34.505
"I've written, Dear Daddy,
we miss you...

33:36.590 --> 33:42.095
"...and wish you were with us to love.

33:43.012 --> 33:47.892
"Instead of a stamp, I put kisses.

33:49.810 --> 33:52.604
"The postman says...

34:09.286 --> 34:13.083
"The postman says...

34:13.208 --> 34:14.876
"...that's best to do.

34:18.295 --> 34:22.174
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

34:25.677 --> 34:27.387
"...saying, 'I...

34:29.306 --> 34:30.598
"...Iove... you."'

34:53.703 --> 34:55.371
"Now when I'm very good...

34:55.580 --> 34:59.083
"...And do as I am told...

34:59.584 --> 35:01.210
"...I'm Mama's little angel.

35:02.170 --> 35:05.882
"And Papa says I'm good as gold.

35:05.882 --> 35:07.675
"But when I'm very bad...

35:09.010 --> 35:11.178
"...and answer back and sass...

35:11.887 --> 35:13.472
"...then I'm Mama's little devil.

35:14.306 --> 35:17.184
"And Papa says I've got the brass.

35:19.269 --> 35:21.980
"Now I wish that you would tell me...

35:23.273 --> 35:26.275
"...'cause I'm much too young
to know..."

36:09.275 --> 36:11.777
All right, Blanche Hudson!

36:12.069 --> 36:14.988
Ms. Big, Fat, Movie Star!

36:15.405 --> 36:18.366
Ms. Rotten, Stinking Actress!

36:18.700 --> 36:20.285
Press a button, ring a bell...

36:20.577 --> 36:24.789
...and you think the whole damn world
comes running, don't you?!

36:27.083 --> 36:28.667
Lunch, Ms. Hudson?

36:29.084 --> 36:32.379
Why, certainly, Ms. Hudson!

36:32.671 --> 36:37.300
I'm sure we can find something
appropriate for you, Ms. Hudson!

37:13.876 --> 37:17.088
Oh, you brought my lunch.
A bit early, isn't it?

37:17.296 --> 37:18.797
Then what were you ringing for?

37:19.173 --> 37:22.467
Oh, I wanted to tell you,
something's wrong with the telephone.

37:22.676 --> 37:24.678
Maybe it's been left off
the hook downstairs.

37:24.678 --> 37:26.471
Is that so?

37:26.596 --> 37:28.766
Who'd you wanna call, Blanche?

37:29.099 --> 37:32.895
Well, actually I wanted
to call Bert Hanley.

37:34.188 --> 37:36.482
Oh, our business manager?

37:38.484 --> 37:42.863
There's something I've been
meaning to discuss with you.

37:50.286 --> 37:53.580
Well, I'm afraid I have bad news...
about money.

37:54.289 --> 37:58.793
You see the point is, Bert thinks
we'll probably have to sell the house.

38:00.670 --> 38:03.464
Why should we have to
sell the house, Blanche?

38:06.258 --> 38:08.678
Well, that's what I'm trying
to tell you.

38:09.179 --> 38:12.181
Our financial position
is such that we just...

38:12.473 --> 38:13.683
...we can't afford to...

38:13.975 --> 38:15.893
We've got plenty of
money invested. I know.

38:16.185 --> 38:18.897
Yes... yes, that's quite true, but...

38:19.397 --> 38:22.358
...some of those investments
aren't paying much.

38:24.777 --> 38:28.697
When did our business manager
tell you all this?

38:29.990 --> 38:31.491
Early last week, I think.

38:32.868 --> 38:35.662
He didn't call here last week.
I know that, too.

38:35.995 --> 38:40.166
No, we didn't actually speak
on the telephone.

38:40.458 --> 38:41.459
He wrote me a letter.

38:41.584 --> 38:43.294
He didn't write you any letter either.

38:43.585 --> 38:44.878
There hasn't been a letter
from his office since...

38:44.878 --> 38:45.879
Yes, Jane, there has.

38:45.963 --> 38:49.175
Oh, you're a liar! You're just a liar!
You always were!

38:50.760 --> 38:53.679
Bert Hanley never wrote you any letter
and never called you on the phone...

38:53.887 --> 38:55.472
...tellin' you to sell the house.

38:55.681 --> 38:59.059
You called him four weeks ago
and told him to sell it!

39:01.394 --> 39:03.479
I did nothing of the sort.

39:04.272 --> 39:08.193
Don't you think I know everything
that goes on in this house?

39:11.696 --> 39:13.489
You've been spying on me!

39:15.157 --> 39:16.992
What do you think?!

39:17.576 --> 39:19.078
You are disgusting!

39:20.579 --> 39:22.080
After all I've done for you!

39:22.372 --> 39:23.957
When all I'm trying to do is help.

39:24.082 --> 39:26.292
Who are you tryin' to help, Blanche?

39:26.793 --> 39:29.463
What were you plannin' to do with me
when you sold the house?

39:29.755 --> 39:31.256
What'd you have in mind...

39:31.465 --> 39:34.384
...some nice little place
where they could look after me?

39:46.561 --> 39:50.065
Better not tire yourself out
using the phone anymore.

39:50.774 --> 39:53.860
If there are any calls,
I'll take them downstairs.

39:57.364 --> 39:59.991
Eat your lunch, it'll get cold!

41:26.781 --> 41:29.158
Jane! Please wait.

41:34.454 --> 41:37.583
Jane, I want to talk to you... please!

41:38.167 --> 41:39.668
Jane, I want to talk to...

43:13.443 --> 43:14.862
Telephone, mother.

43:15.654 --> 43:17.030
All right, dear.

44:15.627 --> 44:17.629
I called this morning and placed an ad.

44:17.963 --> 44:19.631
Did we give you a reference number?

44:19.631 --> 44:20.548
Oh, yeah.

44:30.849 --> 44:33.852
Here it is.
You want to check the copy?

44:39.524 --> 44:40.733
That's fine.

44:40.942 --> 44:43.235
Did you want this to go in the
"Personal" column or in the want ads?

44:43.444 --> 44:46.156
Well, I always think the "Personal"
column's nicer, don't you.

44:50.159 --> 44:53.538
That's an eight-line ad.
That'll be $6.30.

45:02.129 --> 45:03.839
Who's placing this ad?

45:05.424 --> 45:06.425
We have to know.

45:07.050 --> 45:08.051
Why, I am!

45:09.261 --> 45:11.137
Yeah, I know, but who for?

45:11.429 --> 45:13.348
You see, when you're placing
an advertisement for someone...

45:13.348 --> 45:15.850
...to do a job for you, we have to
have your name for the record.

45:16.058 --> 45:18.852
Well, my name is... Jane Hudson.

45:24.024 --> 45:28.028
Maybe you remember me.
I'm Baby Jane Hudson!

45:30.030 --> 45:30.823
Sure.

45:31.949 --> 45:34.451
Thank you. This will be
in the paper tomorrow.

45:38.955 --> 45:41.957
Who the hell was Baby Jane Hudson?

45:44.336 --> 45:47.630
"Please call Dr. Shelby
at OL6-1656 and...

45:47.839 --> 45:50.424
"...ask him to come
to the house immediately."

45:59.224 --> 46:02.727
"Under no circumstances...

46:05.856 --> 46:08.650
"...let my sister...

46:09.943 --> 46:14.530
"...see the contents...

46:14.739 --> 46:18.826
"...of this note.

46:19.535 --> 46:21.828
"...Blanche Hudson."

47:31.228 --> 47:32.938
Oh, Ms. Hudson, how nice to see you.

47:33.313 --> 47:35.523
- I was just going to call on you.
- Why?

47:35.732 --> 47:38.651
I just wanted to ask you about the
flowers I brought over for your sister.

47:38.818 --> 47:41.112
I'm afraid they don't last very long
this time of year and...

47:41.320 --> 47:43.447
...I thought perhaps
you'd like some more.

47:45.949 --> 47:47.117
You could've saved yourself
the trouble.

47:47.242 --> 47:48.618
Oh, but it's no trouble at all.

47:48.743 --> 47:51.412
I've just been cutting some,
that's why I came over.

47:51.829 --> 47:53.414
I always think it's so nice
to have flowers...

47:53.539 --> 47:54.916
...in the house...
- Mrs. Bates!

47:55.416 --> 47:58.335
I guess if my sister needed flowers,
we could afford to buy them!

48:43.045 --> 48:45.714
What's the matter, Mother? You look
as though you've been in a fight.

48:46.048 --> 48:47.841
I'm not sure that I haven't been.

48:48.133 --> 48:51.344
Jane Hudson makes me so mad,
I could kill her!

48:52.637 --> 48:54.013
That's a good idea.

48:54.347 --> 48:55.806
What'll we use?

49:53.236 --> 49:55.237
Did you have a nice drive?

49:56.030 --> 49:57.406
What are you talking about?

49:57.740 --> 50:00.409
Nothing, dear. It's been so long
since you were out of the house.

50:00.742 --> 50:03.204
I though perhaps you'd gone
for a drive or something.

50:03.537 --> 50:05.122
You know, I was thinking...

50:06.332 --> 50:09.418
...it's been so long since
we had a talk...

50:10.210 --> 50:13.004
...you know, a real talk
about the future and everything.

50:17.508 --> 50:19.927
I didn't want you to be worried
about the house.

50:20.219 --> 50:23.138
Even if I do have to sell it,
we'll still be together.

50:23.430 --> 50:25.807
Blanche, you're not going
to sell this house.

50:27.225 --> 50:29.102
Daddy bought this house.

50:29.436 --> 50:31.020
And he bought it for me.

50:33.314 --> 50:35.608
You don't think I remember that,
do you?

50:36.609 --> 50:38.528
You're wrong, Jane.

50:38.611 --> 50:40.113
You've just forgotten.

50:41.030 --> 50:43.033
I bought this house for the two of us...

50:43.200 --> 50:44.701
...when I signed my first contract.

50:44.826 --> 50:47.537
You don't think I remember anything,
do you?

50:48.538 --> 50:50.331
There're a whole lot of things
I remember.

50:50.623 --> 50:52.708
And you never paid for this house.

50:53.626 --> 50:57.921
Baby Jane paid for this house,
that's who!

50:58.338 --> 51:00.299
You don't know what you're saying.

51:04.427 --> 51:07.305
You aren't ever gonna
sell this house.

51:07.722 --> 51:10.224
And you aren't ever
gonna leave it...

51:11.600 --> 51:13.018
...either.

51:26.323 --> 51:29.702
Do you remember when
I first came back after the accident?

51:34.998 --> 51:38.335
You promised you wouldn't ever
talk about that again.

51:38.501 --> 51:39.836
I know I did...

51:40.628 --> 51:42.630
...but I'm still in this chair.

51:42.797 --> 51:45.925
After all those years
I'm still in this chair.

51:46.217 --> 51:49.303
Doesn't that give you
some kind of responsibility?

51:49.803 --> 51:52.931
Jane, I'm just trying to explain
to you how things really are.

51:53.515 --> 51:55.600
You wouldn't be able to do
these awful things to me...

51:55.725 --> 51:57.810
...if I weren't still in this chair!

52:02.899 --> 52:06.527
But you are, Blanche!
You are in that chair!

52:07.528 --> 52:12.324
And tell me what are these awful things
I'm supposed to be doing to you?

52:15.202 --> 52:16.496
Well I meant...

52:17.497 --> 52:19.999
...you wouldn't have to work so hard.

52:20.624 --> 52:22.918
And I was thinking maybe...

52:23.001 --> 52:25.712
...maybe Elvira could come in
more often.

52:26.296 --> 52:28.506
Maybe she could even live with us.

52:29.424 --> 52:31.718
We don't need Elvira!

52:33.302 --> 52:35.304
But you get so tired, you...

52:36.305 --> 52:38.807
There's so much to do,
and you're not well.

52:39.808 --> 52:41.310
Maybe you're right.

52:42.603 --> 52:45.397
Maybe I should get
a check-up or something.

52:46.815 --> 52:48.901
That would be wonderful!

52:50.110 --> 52:54.114
Perhaps we can, we can find
a really good doctor.

52:54.906 --> 52:58.910
We could get hold of that
nice Dr. Shelby, couldn't we?

53:00.494 --> 53:02.121
Let's see...

53:02.997 --> 53:04.998
...what's his number again?

53:14.508 --> 53:17.427
"...Under no circumstances...

53:17.928 --> 53:22.015
"...tell my sister the contents
of this note."

53:23.517 --> 53:26.311
It's not me that needs
a doctor, Blanche!

55:27.904 --> 55:29.780
Hello, lovey.

55:30.698 --> 55:32.908
Now, don't stop for me.

55:33.200 --> 55:34.786
What did the doctor say?

55:35.995 --> 55:40.708
He says it's no use my trying
to go back to work for six months.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.877
Didn't he even give you
anything new to take?

55:43.085 --> 55:45.379
Oh, he says it's arthritis.

55:45.671 --> 55:50.008
An' the only thing for me to do is
not to try an' work until it clears up.

55:50.300 --> 55:53.886
Did he suggest what we're going
to use for money in the meantime?

55:54.804 --> 55:58.182
No, dear.
But he's ever such a nice man.

56:00.685 --> 56:03.104
Now, lovey, never you mind, anyway.

56:03.604 --> 56:06.774
You know, we've still got
a bit of savings.

56:07.191 --> 56:09.568
You're my little worrier.

56:10.777 --> 56:13.697
That's nice.
You've found something, have you?

56:13.989 --> 56:17.575
You don't have to get so excited.
You haven't even seen what it is yet.

56:18.493 --> 56:20.786
No, dear but it's a possibility,
isn't it?

56:20.995 --> 56:23.873
I mean, there aren't that many jobs
that'd be suitable...

56:24.207 --> 56:27.001
...I mean for someone
with your qualifications.

56:27.293 --> 56:30.379
What qualifications?

56:31.505 --> 56:34.383
Well, you know... serious music
and that...

56:34.591 --> 56:38.470
Oh, this sounds like
just the ticket, doesn't it?

56:42.266 --> 56:44.685
- You're gonna call?
- Call who?

56:45.394 --> 56:46.978
These people.

56:47.979 --> 56:48.772
Might as well.

56:48.897 --> 56:49.898
Now?

56:50.190 --> 56:54.694
Well, it wouldn't be a lot of bloody use
calling next week, would it?

56:59.990 --> 57:03.702
Mom, tell you what.
Why don't you call for me?

57:04.494 --> 57:06.371
Tell them you're my secretary
or something.

57:06.496 --> 57:08.873
All right, dear, I'll do that.

57:10.082 --> 57:12.294
And listen, I won't let on who I am.

57:12.586 --> 57:16.589
You see, I'll just tell 'em
I'm Mr. Flagg's "secketary."

57:16.881 --> 57:20.469
- Secretary.
- Sec-re-tary.

57:23.096 --> 57:24.264
Well, do you know...

57:24.472 --> 57:26.474
...I do believe yer old mum'd...

57:26.683 --> 57:29.894
...be a jolly good "secketary" at that.

57:30.895 --> 57:33.188
Don't you think?

57:49.495 --> 57:51.288
This is Jane Hudson.

57:53.290 --> 57:55.375
Oh, about the ad!

57:57.168 --> 57:58.295
Who is this?

57:58.587 --> 58:01.466
This is Mr. Flagg's "secketary."

58:02.300 --> 58:04.302
Oh, his secretary.

58:05.970 --> 58:07.971
Mr. Flagg is very interested.

58:08.263 --> 58:10.599
And he'd like to know if
he can have an appointment.

58:10.891 --> 58:14.894
I think you'll find
he's very well qualified.

58:15.770 --> 58:18.773
Well, sure, I'd be glad to give
Mr. Flagg an appointment.

58:19.774 --> 58:21.692
Well, now, let me see...

58:22.276 --> 58:23.986
...how 'bout 4:00 this afternoon?

58:26.988 --> 58:29.491
I think that would be fine.

58:30.992 --> 58:32.994
Well, I'll be expecting him then.

58:41.586 --> 58:43.796
It's all fixed, lovey.

58:44.088 --> 58:48.175
Ah, yer old mum's managed everything...

58:48.759 --> 58:50.260
...hasn't she?

58:57.559 --> 58:58.769
Oh, shut up!

59:10.571 --> 59:11.864
What do you want this time?

59:12.156 --> 59:13.490
Who was on the telephone?

59:13.657 --> 59:15.867
None of your business!
What were you ringing for?

59:16.159 --> 59:17.160
I'm hungry, Jane.

59:17.494 --> 59:19.288
Well, of course you're hungry.
You didn't eat your dinner.

59:19.372 --> 59:20.664
That's why you're hungry.

59:21.874 --> 59:23.375
But you forgot my breakfast.

59:23.876 --> 59:26.169
I didn't forget your breakfast.

59:26.962 --> 59:28.755
I didn't bring your breakfast...

59:29.089 --> 59:31.591
...because you didn't eat your din-din.

59:35.261 --> 59:36.971
We're right back where we started.

59:37.263 --> 59:40.183
When I was on the stage, you had
to depend on me for everything...

59:40.475 --> 59:42.977
...even the food you ate
came from me.

59:43.269 --> 59:45.688
Now you have to depend on me
for your food again.

59:45.980 --> 59:47.856
So you see, we're right back
where we started.

59:48.482 --> 59:50.359
Why are you doing this to me?

59:50.359 --> 59:51.276
Why?

59:52.360 --> 59:53.361
Doing what?

59:53.778 --> 59:56.864
Making me afraid to eat,
trying to make me starve myself.

59:58.075 --> 59:59.493
Don't be silly.

01:00:00.077 --> 01:00:02.162
If you starve, you die.

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:04.873
I don't know what you're talking about.
You really must be sick!

01:00:08.376 --> 01:00:10.252
Did you ever stop to think that...

01:00:10.878 --> 01:00:14.089
...if anything happened to me,
I mean anything bad...

01:00:15.173 --> 01:00:17.092
...there wouldn't be any money for you?

01:00:17.259 --> 01:00:19.177
I wouldn't be here to sign the checks.

01:00:19.469 --> 01:00:21.387
You wouldn't even have pocket money.

01:00:22.472 --> 01:00:24.473
Did you ever think of that?

01:00:25.391 --> 01:00:27.184
I've thought about that.

01:00:32.065 --> 01:00:34.191
Why didn't you eat your dinner?

01:00:35.484 --> 01:00:37.070
Because I'm afraid.

01:00:37.279 --> 01:00:38.988
You made me afraid.

01:00:39.781 --> 01:00:43.367
I thought you were supposed to be
the big girl in this family.

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:48.288
Nothing wrong with it.

01:00:49.081 --> 01:00:51.166
You're just a neurotic, Blanche!

01:00:53.585 --> 01:00:54.461
D'you know that...

01:00:54.586 --> 01:00:56.379
...you're just a neurotic?

01:01:03.177 --> 01:01:05.387
- Good morning, Elvira.
- Good morning.

01:01:13.561 --> 01:01:16.272
- Please, Jane, I'm so hungry.
- I have to go now.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.359
But just a little, please!

01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:22.988
No. You didn't eat your din-din,
so you'll have to wait till lunchtime.

01:01:23.155 --> 01:01:27.075
Jane, please... don't do this to me.
Jane! Please!

01:01:51.347 --> 01:01:54.266
- Good morning, Elvira.
- Good morning, Ms. Jane.

01:01:56.059 --> 01:01:57.979
I wanna talk to you.

01:01:58.145 --> 01:02:00.147
- I want to apologize.
- Apologize?

01:02:00.856 --> 01:02:04.568
I wasn't feeling so well yesterday,
so I was unkind to you.

01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:07.362
I want to make it up.

01:02:07.445 --> 01:02:09.949
I got up this morning
and fixed the house.

01:02:11.283 --> 01:02:13.160
So you can have the whole day off.

01:02:14.077 --> 01:02:15.871
Here's your $15.

01:02:16.454 --> 01:02:19.249
Well, thanks, but does Miss...
What I mean, is...

01:02:19.582 --> 01:02:21.376
...does Ms. Blanche know
about my taking the day off?

01:02:21.459 --> 01:02:22.960
Oh, sure, she knows.

01:02:23.878 --> 01:02:25.963
All right... if you say so.

01:02:26.255 --> 01:02:28.382
See you next Tuesday then.

01:02:29.466 --> 01:02:30.759
Have a good time.

01:02:31.968 --> 01:02:33.053
Goodbye.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.856
Bye!

01:04:09.561 --> 01:04:11.437
Who was that at the door earlier?

01:04:11.562 --> 01:04:12.563
Elvira.

01:04:13.356 --> 01:04:15.441
Where is she now? In the kitchen?

01:04:16.442 --> 01:04:19.069
No. I gave her the day off.

01:04:19.361 --> 01:04:21.738
She has a pretty hard time, considering.

01:04:21.947 --> 01:04:23.865
I told her to come back next week.

01:04:31.747 --> 01:04:33.373
You know we got rats in the cellar?

01:07:08.562 --> 01:07:09.730
Good afternoon.

01:07:14.235 --> 01:07:15.444
Mr. Flagg?

01:07:15.736 --> 01:07:18.030
Yes, I'm Edwin Flagg.

01:07:19.739 --> 01:07:23.743
I have an appointment with
Ms. Hudson for 4:00 o'clock.

01:07:24.327 --> 01:07:26.454
I'm Jane Hudson.

01:07:27.455 --> 01:07:30.541
My, you're... you're right on time,
aren't you?

01:07:30.833 --> 01:07:32.626
Yes, I believe I am.

01:07:33.752 --> 01:07:34.753
Come in.

01:07:55.357 --> 01:07:57.358
We can talk here in the living room.

01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:06.658
Oh, I say... what a perfectly
charming room.

01:08:09.828 --> 01:08:12.747
- So, you're Edwin Flagg?
- Yes, that's right.

01:08:14.249 --> 01:08:16.125
I'll bring you some tea. You like tea?

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:19.044
Oh, yes. I'm quite fond of tea.

01:08:19.252 --> 01:08:21.337
You must've guessed that I'm English.

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:24.256
Oh, really? How nice for you.

01:09:37.410 --> 01:09:38.828
Oh, here, let me help you.

01:09:39.703 --> 01:09:40.787
That's a terribly big...

01:09:40.872 --> 01:09:43.082
...burden for such a little girl.

01:09:43.499 --> 01:09:45.792
Thank you. You're very kind.

01:09:47.711 --> 01:09:50.380
It's so hot today.
Did you drive here in your car?

01:09:50.589 --> 01:09:52.508
Well, actually I took a cab.

01:09:52.591 --> 01:09:56.386
It's a bit of a nuisance, but I had
to put my car in for servicing.

01:09:57.387 --> 01:09:58.889
- Oh. Cream or lemon?
- Cream.

01:10:01.182 --> 01:10:02.392
Sugar?

01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:10.399
My, it looks good.

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:15.570
I always think it's nice
to break bread...

01:10:15.779 --> 01:10:18.281
...with strangers, don't you?
- Oh, yes, indeed.

01:10:20.492 --> 01:10:23.495
I don't think you actually mentioned
the exact nature of...

01:10:24.371 --> 01:10:26.081
Well, I've been retired
for some time now.

01:10:26.373 --> 01:10:29.292
I've been taking care of someone
in my family who's sick.

01:10:29.375 --> 01:10:31.586
And now you're free to return
to your profession?

01:10:31.586 --> 01:10:32.504
Yes.

01:10:33.505 --> 01:10:35.006
And what exactly...

01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:38.468
I mean, I take it you are a soloist.
Some instrument?

01:10:41.387 --> 01:10:43.472
I wonder if you can guess who I am.

01:10:47.601 --> 01:10:48.977
Can you give me a hint?

01:10:49.394 --> 01:10:52.397
Well, it's not fair to make you guess.

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:55.900
I'm Baby Jane Hudson!

01:11:04.991 --> 01:11:08.578
Oh! Do you mean you're really
the Baby Jane Hudson?

01:11:09.078 --> 01:11:10.205
Yes, I am!

01:11:10.497 --> 01:11:13.668
And I'm going to revive my act
exactly as I used to do it.

01:11:14.001 --> 01:11:16.587
Of course, some of the arrangements
will have to be brought up to date.

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:19.381
Music changes so much, doesn't it?

01:11:19.673 --> 01:11:21.466
And you know, they're desperate
for new acts. Television...

01:11:21.592 --> 01:11:23.969
...Las Vegas and all the clubs and...

01:11:24.177 --> 01:11:27.180
...there are a lot of people
who remember me, lots of them.

01:11:28.681 --> 01:11:30.683
I don't see how you could fail.

01:11:37.898 --> 01:11:39.900
You know, I had a kind of a feeling...

01:11:39.983 --> 01:11:42.193
...the minute I opened that door
and saw you standing there.

01:11:42.569 --> 01:11:45.363
I just knew we were going to be friends.

01:11:45.696 --> 01:11:47.573
I've been thinking about costumes.

01:11:48.199 --> 01:11:48.991
Costumes...

01:11:49.074 --> 01:11:50.200
Yes. I took some of my old ones...

01:11:50.284 --> 01:11:52.787
...down to be copied.
You think that's a good idea?

01:11:52.996 --> 01:11:54.372
Of course.

01:11:54.789 --> 01:11:57.166
But I don't quite remember...

01:11:57.375 --> 01:11:59.169
How silly of me, Edwin.
How could you?

01:11:59.377 --> 01:12:01.963
But I do want your opinion.
I really do.

01:12:02.088 --> 01:12:04.173
All my scrap books and stuff
are in the rehearsal room and...

01:12:04.298 --> 01:12:06.467
...you can look at them
and tell me what you think.

01:12:08.594 --> 01:12:10.596
- You'd like to see them, wouldn't you?
- Well, of course.

01:12:13.098 --> 01:12:16.267
Oh, I wish Daddy could be here
right now!

01:12:16.976 --> 01:12:19.771
"You can never lose your talent,"
he used to tell me.

01:12:20.062 --> 01:12:23.399
"You can lose everything
but you can't lose your talent!"

01:12:31.073 --> 01:12:32.366
I think you'll find these clippings...

01:12:32.491 --> 01:12:34.076
...very interesting.

01:12:34.285 --> 01:12:36.370
Daddy saved them for me
from the very first.

01:12:36.662 --> 01:12:39.080
He used to put them in special books.

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:43.960
I always liked that picture.

01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.878
It's so sad.

01:12:54.971 --> 01:12:56.889
- Will you excuse me?
- Yes, certainly.

01:13:09.859 --> 01:13:12.988
You always spoil everything!
Don't you?!

01:13:13.488 --> 01:13:16.282
- No, Jane. I just wanted to know...
- Who is down there? I'll tell ya!

01:13:16.991 --> 01:13:19.869
I got a friend down there.
Someone who's come to see me!

01:13:20.161 --> 01:13:23.164
He doesn't even know you exist!
And you don't like that, do you?

01:13:23.289 --> 01:13:25.582
But you're wrong, Jane.
I've always wanted you to have friends.

01:13:25.666 --> 01:13:27.084
That's what I've always wanted, really.

01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:28.585
Then how come I never had any?

01:13:28.794 --> 01:13:30.295
Well, maybe you weren't...

01:13:30.795 --> 01:13:32.964
...I've, I mean, you were
just too independent...

01:13:33.256 --> 01:13:34.257
No, that's not why!

01:13:34.382 --> 01:13:36.592
You always stopped me
from having friends, that's why!

01:13:37.176 --> 01:13:39.095
Not anymore, Jane, not anymore.

01:13:39.387 --> 01:13:42.974
I'm pleased that you have a friend.
That's what you need.

01:13:43.057 --> 01:13:45.476
- Oh, sure!
- I was just hoping maybe...

01:13:45.685 --> 01:13:49.063
...I could meet him and we could have
a nice talk just the three of us.

01:13:49.396 --> 01:13:50.774
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

01:13:50.982 --> 01:13:53.192
Then you could tell him
a whole lot of lies about me.

01:13:53.484 --> 01:13:54.777
Scare him off...

01:13:54.986 --> 01:13:56.070
...or maybe have him...

01:13:56.195 --> 01:13:57.863
...for yourself!

01:14:37.859 --> 01:14:42.363
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

01:14:42.989 --> 01:14:47.076
"His address is heaven above."

01:14:48.869 --> 01:14:50.454
That's wonderful!

01:15:02.381 --> 01:15:06.468
"I've written a letter to Daddy.

01:15:07.386 --> 01:15:11.557
"His address is heaven above.

01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:17.563
"I've written, Dear Daddy,
we miss you...

01:15:18.689 --> 01:15:22.651
"...and wish you were with us to love.

01:15:25.571 --> 01:15:29.574
"Instead of a stamp I put kisses.

01:15:30.575 --> 01:15:34.662
"The postman says that's best to do.

01:15:37.164 --> 01:15:41.251
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

01:15:41.376 --> 01:15:46.256
"...saying, I love you.

01:16:39.681 --> 01:16:43.852
"I've written a letter to Daddy...

01:16:43.977 --> 01:16:48.272
"...saying, I love you!"

01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:11.545
Oh, Edwin, you certainly
can play, can't you?

01:17:11.462 --> 01:17:14.339
- And you certainly can sing.
- Oh, thank you.

01:17:14.965 --> 01:17:17.342
I can see you've done
this kind of work before.

01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:18.843
No. Not really.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.846
Actually, I've spent most of my time
on serious music.

01:17:21.929 --> 01:17:23.556
Composing, and that sort of thing.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:25.850
You mean, this will be your
first contact with show business?

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.226
Not exactly.

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.437
You see, my father was
quite well known as an actor.

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:32.939
In the movies?
Maybe I worked with him.

01:17:33.231 --> 01:17:35.650
I shouldn't think so.

01:17:35.942 --> 01:17:38.444
He's been dead quite a long time now.

01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:41.364
I lost my daddy when
I was quite young, too.

01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:44.534
Of course, he was more in the
classical tradition, I mean as an actor.

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:46.452
Shakespeare and that sort of thing.

01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:49.540
People used to say Daddy could've been
a star in his own right.

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:51.541
He was a musician, too.

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:52.751
Oh? What instrument?

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:54.127
Piano and banjo.

01:17:57.046 --> 01:17:59.340
Oh, that's very interesting.

01:17:59.632 --> 01:18:02.551
You know, the banjo's a very
native American instrument.

01:18:02.926 --> 01:18:04.761
Of course, my father was British...

01:18:05.262 --> 01:18:06.263
...but he never...

01:18:06.346 --> 01:18:09.057
...really got a chance
out here in Hollywood.

01:18:09.349 --> 01:18:11.059
Oh, that's too bad.

01:18:22.527 --> 01:18:23.653
It's funny, really.

01:18:23.945 --> 01:18:27.031
Because actually he came from a
rather distinguished family, socially...

01:18:27.323 --> 01:18:30.661
...and yet nearly all the parts he had
were playing menials, butlers and such.

01:18:31.453 --> 01:18:32.454
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

01:18:33.748 --> 01:18:34.957
I don't think my mother...

01:18:35.124 --> 01:18:38.043
...ever really appreciated
what he was trying to do.

01:18:38.544 --> 01:18:40.128
Oh, I know what you mean.

01:18:40.337 --> 01:18:43.923
It's very hard for an artist
when people don't understand.

01:18:44.257 --> 01:18:45.133
I remember when...

01:18:45.258 --> 01:18:47.635
I sometimes try to explain to her...

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.929
...that if you're going to produce
anything decent in the way...

01:18:50.054 --> 01:18:51.722
...of serious music...

01:18:52.556 --> 01:18:55.642
...you must have the right atmosphere.

01:18:56.059 --> 01:18:58.144
But of course.
Delia can't understand that.

01:18:59.521 --> 01:19:01.856
Delia? Who's Delia?

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:05.943
You might not think it to look at her,
but she is my mother.

01:19:08.822 --> 01:19:10.823
For a minute I thought you had...

01:19:11.032 --> 01:19:12.950
...a wife or a lady friend...

01:19:13.159 --> 01:19:14.744
...tucked away somewhere.

01:19:16.954 --> 01:19:21.750
Oh, no. Nothing like that. How much
were you actually thinking of paying?

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:23.252
Paying?

01:19:28.257 --> 01:19:29.424
Well, what do you think?

01:19:34.054 --> 01:19:35.430
How about a $100?

01:19:36.347 --> 01:19:38.349
A week, of course.

01:19:41.018 --> 01:19:42.519
Oh. I think that would be fair.

01:19:42.728 --> 01:19:44.521
Then that's settled.

01:19:44.730 --> 01:19:46.440
I don't like talking about money,
do you?

01:19:46.732 --> 01:19:50.236
No. It's not that important, is it?
Not like relationships between people...

01:19:50.528 --> 01:19:53.238
...but the thing is, if I'm going to
move out and give up my pupils...

01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:55.449
...I'll have to know for sure.

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:57.951
When were you thinking of starting?

01:19:58.743 --> 01:20:01.329
Just when could you let me
have some money?

01:20:02.538 --> 01:20:07.042
Well, I've some family matters
to take care of...

01:20:08.127 --> 01:20:11.046
...that should take about a week or so.

01:20:11.338 --> 01:20:14.717
Well, then I don't see why
we couldn't start rehearsing right away.

01:20:17.928 --> 01:20:19.221
Tell you what, Edwin...

01:20:19.555 --> 01:20:23.850
...I'll pay you first thing Wednesday,
a month in advance.

01:20:25.435 --> 01:20:26.644
It's done.

01:20:26.937 --> 01:20:29.356
How about going to dinner
somewhere nice?

01:20:29.648 --> 01:20:31.316
Oh, it sounds fine.

01:20:31.942 --> 01:20:33.318
Why don't you come with me now?

01:20:33.443 --> 01:20:35.320
I've got to go down and pick up
my costumes and then...

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.321
...we could go on to dinner from there.

01:20:38.114 --> 01:20:42.618
Oh, I promised my mo...
...Delia I'd be home for supper.

01:20:43.827 --> 01:20:46.038
Oh. Well, I'll drive you home then.

01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:49.124
Oh, I'm so excited.

01:20:49.416 --> 01:20:53.044
You know, I know everything
is going to go just marvelously.

01:20:53.628 --> 01:20:56.714
I have to go up and change.
I won't be a minute.

01:21:17.735 --> 01:21:18.652
This is really...

01:21:18.944 --> 01:21:21.113
...a rather charming neighborhood.

01:21:24.115 --> 01:21:26.951
Yes, I've always found it very nice.

01:23:34.237 --> 01:23:36.114
I just can't wait to get started now,
rehearsing.

01:23:36.406 --> 01:23:38.241
We're going to be a great team,
the two of us.

01:23:38.533 --> 01:23:40.743
Oh, I'm sure we are.

01:23:42.703 --> 01:23:44.538
I'll see you Wednesday. Bye.

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.496
This is Blanche, Blanche Hudson.

01:26:42.706 --> 01:26:45.875
I need your help. Is the doctor there?
I must talk to him.

01:26:46.293 --> 01:26:48.003
Well, he's with a patient right now.

01:26:48.587 --> 01:26:51.214
But I have to talk to him.
I've got to.

01:26:51.798 --> 01:26:54.509
Hold on, please.
I'll see if I can interrupt him.

01:26:58.596 --> 01:27:01.974
Ms. Hill tells me you're a little upset.
What seems to be the trouble?

01:27:03.392 --> 01:27:05.686
You must come. I need you here.

01:27:12.484 --> 01:27:14.486
No. It's about my sister.

01:27:15.278 --> 01:27:17.781
I need your help. I need you here.

01:27:18.281 --> 01:27:19.699
Here at the house.

01:27:20.408 --> 01:27:22.493
No. It's nothing like that.

01:27:23.911 --> 01:27:26.080
It's the way she's behaving.

01:27:27.081 --> 01:27:30.792
You've got to come over right away.
Please, before she comes back.

01:27:31.001 --> 01:27:32.377
I don't quite understand.

01:27:32.585 --> 01:27:35.088
Is this some kind of emotional
disturbance you're talking about?

01:27:35.381 --> 01:27:38.800
Yes, she's emotionally disturbed.

01:27:39.301 --> 01:27:41.094
She's unbalanced.

01:27:42.804 --> 01:27:44.890
I don't know, doctor.

01:27:45.599 --> 01:27:47.476
Are you trying to tell me
that she's violent?

01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:49.186
Yes!

01:27:49.811 --> 01:27:50.979
Yes, she is!

01:28:08.495 --> 01:28:10.705
I'm... not sure.

01:28:23.968 --> 01:28:26.679
We aren't getting anywhere like this.
I'll come over right away.

01:28:32.601 --> 01:28:34.478
I know who it was.

01:28:34.770 --> 01:28:36.188
No, Jane, that really was...

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:38.774
And I know what you're trying to do.

01:28:38.982 --> 01:28:41.484
I'm not trying to do anything.
Honestly, Jane.

01:29:44.585 --> 01:29:46.796
This is Blanche Hudson again.

01:29:47.171 --> 01:29:48.589
Could I speak to the doctor?

01:29:48.881 --> 01:29:52.301
Oh, yes, certainly. Hold on, please.
I'll try and catch him.

01:30:01.601 --> 01:30:03.395
Hello, Blanche. I'm on my way now.

01:30:04.271 --> 01:30:06.981
Oh, I'm so glad I caught you in time.

01:30:07.273 --> 01:30:10.276
Dr. Shelby, we're not going
to need you after all.

01:30:11.902 --> 01:30:15.489
I know, but Jane has gone
to another doctor.

01:30:16.365 --> 01:30:19.493
- Another doctor?
- Yes. Another doctor.

01:30:20.368 --> 01:30:22.580
Well, of course, if she's chosen
to go to someone else...

01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:28.502
Well, after all,
we really can't interfere, can we?

01:30:28.668 --> 01:30:31.296
If Jane's chosen to go
to another doctor...

01:30:32.088 --> 01:30:33.881
I'm very sorry.

01:30:40.596 --> 01:30:42.681
Goodbye, doctor.

01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:24.679
I thought I told you not to come back
until next week.

01:31:24.762 --> 01:31:27.890
Yes, but I had a free day today
so I thought I'd come by and see...

01:31:27.973 --> 01:31:30.392
...if there was anything needed doin'.
- Well, there isn't anything.

01:31:30.392 --> 01:31:32.477
So you could've saved yourself
the trouble.

01:31:33.061 --> 01:31:35.772
I was gonna write you a note, but now
you're here I may as well tell you.

01:31:35.981 --> 01:31:37.774
We're not gonna be
needing you anymore.

01:31:38.483 --> 01:31:40.193
But I don't understand.

01:31:40.359 --> 01:31:41.696
We're closing up the house.

01:31:41.988 --> 01:31:43.990
Blanche wants to take
a smaller place at the beach.

01:31:44.073 --> 01:31:46.867
The doctor thinks that's best for her
so that's what we're going to do.

01:31:47.368 --> 01:31:50.496
Oh, don't worry, you'll be paid
for today. I'll send you a check.

01:31:50.787 --> 01:31:52.289
I'm not worried about any pay.

01:31:52.372 --> 01:31:54.374
I'd just like to see
Ms. Blanche before I go.

01:31:55.583 --> 01:31:57.961
Well, you can't. She's asleep.

01:32:00.171 --> 01:32:02.173
That's all right. I don't mind waiting.

01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:05.092
Well, I do, I gotta leave,
so just gimme the keys to the house.

01:32:07.886 --> 01:32:10.764
I'm sorry, I don't have the keys.
I must've left 'em at home.

01:32:11.056 --> 01:32:12.682
Anyway, go. You're fired.

01:34:02.869 --> 01:34:06.163
Ms. Blanche, are you awake?

01:34:27.977 --> 01:34:30.062
Are you all right in there?

01:34:33.565 --> 01:34:36.276
Wait now, and I'll go find the key.

01:34:40.863 --> 01:34:41.781
Thank you.

01:34:45.451 --> 01:34:47.577
Good morning, Ms. Hudson.

01:34:48.453 --> 01:34:50.080
How's Ms. Blanche these days?

01:34:51.247 --> 01:34:53.249
She's just fine.

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:55.543
Your deposit slip?

01:34:56.252 --> 01:34:59.172
Well, Blanche wanted me
to get it all in cash this time.

01:34:59.381 --> 01:35:03.052
- I guess she has some special reason.
- Yes, but doesn't she normally...?

01:35:03.385 --> 01:35:06.680
I mean if she isn't going to deposit
her monthly check, she usually...

01:35:06.763 --> 01:35:09.557
...gives us a call and tells us what
she wants us to do, doesn't she?

01:35:09.974 --> 01:35:11.559
- Didn't she call?
- I don't think so.

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:16.272
Oh, I guess she must still be asleep.
She gave me that check last night.

01:35:16.564 --> 01:35:19.149
I see. Just a moment, please.

01:35:33.954 --> 01:35:36.456
I guess that'll be all right,
Ms. Hudson.

01:35:37.374 --> 01:35:39.752
- Fifty and twenties, all right?
- Yes, please.

01:35:47.050 --> 01:35:50.179
- There you are.
- Thank you.

01:35:58.144 --> 01:36:01.147
Ms. Blanche, I'll tell you right now,
if that sister of yours...

01:36:01.272 --> 01:36:04.275
...has gone and given you
sleeping pills to keep you quiet...

01:36:04.275 --> 01:36:06.277
...while she's out doin'
I don't know what...

01:36:06.444 --> 01:36:09.780
...I'm sure as hell
gonna call the police on her.

01:36:10.447 --> 01:36:12.157
It's all right, Ms. Blanche.

01:36:25.962 --> 01:36:27.046
I'm glad I caught you.

01:36:27.171 --> 01:36:30.466
I hope you don't mind, but there's
something I've been meaning to ask you.

01:36:30.549 --> 01:36:33.260
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm kind of
short of help around the house and...

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:35.345
...I was wondering if you'd mind me
asking your cleaning lady...

01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:37.348
...if she could give me
a couple of days a week.

01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:40.267
As far as I'm concerned,
you can have her as often as you want.

01:36:40.559 --> 01:36:41.769
My sister and I are moving.

01:36:41.852 --> 01:36:43.145
So we won't want her anymore.

01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:45.439
But you'll have to call her
because she isn't here.

01:36:45.564 --> 01:36:47.065
I've already sent her home.

01:36:47.774 --> 01:36:49.442
But I just saw her.

01:36:49.776 --> 01:36:51.861
Yes, but I sent her home.

01:36:51.945 --> 01:36:53.863
Oh, no, but that's impossible.

01:36:54.071 --> 01:36:56.949
I saw her go into the house
a few minutes ago.

01:37:01.871 --> 01:37:03.539
- In the house?
- Yes.

01:37:27.854 --> 01:37:29.563
So, you finally decided to come back.

01:37:31.148 --> 01:37:32.566
What're you doing here?

01:37:34.151 --> 01:37:36.361
- I told you, you were fired.
- Never mind all that.

01:37:36.445 --> 01:37:38.364
I want to know what's goin' on
around here.

01:37:38.656 --> 01:37:41.450
But you said you didn't have your key.

01:37:41.951 --> 01:37:43.535
It just so happened that I did.

01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:46.872
So now you can tell me what you mean
by lockin' Ms. Blanche in her room.

01:37:50.041 --> 01:37:52.460
This isn't Blanche's house, this is
my house. And I can do what I like.

01:37:52.543 --> 01:37:54.545
It doesn't make a bit of difference
whose house it is.

01:37:54.670 --> 01:37:57.047
You've got to act like a grown woman,
the same as everybody else.

01:37:57.172 --> 01:37:58.674
Suppose there'd been a fire
or somethin'...

01:37:58.674 --> 01:38:00.259
...and Ms. Blanche locked up
in her room like that?

01:38:00.342 --> 01:38:01.551
Well, there wasn't.

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:04.846
You open that door and
stop all this nonsense.

01:38:05.263 --> 01:38:06.764
Then give me the key!

01:38:07.265 --> 01:38:09.850
She's asleep. I gave her a pill.

01:38:10.434 --> 01:38:11.769
You did, huh?

01:38:11.936 --> 01:38:14.438
Then you better give me that key
and be quick about it.

01:38:15.147 --> 01:38:17.859
I won't, and you can't make me.

01:38:18.152 --> 01:38:19.236
I'm not afraid of you.

01:38:19.861 --> 01:38:23.239
All right, Ms. Hudson.
I'm not going to fool with you.

01:38:23.365 --> 01:38:24.866
If you won't give me that key...

01:38:24.866 --> 01:38:27.368
...I'll go right and call the police.

01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:30.746
You'll be sorry.

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:32.831
Give me that key.

01:38:45.634 --> 01:38:47.136
I didn't mean her any harm.

01:38:47.469 --> 01:38:49.346
You better not have done her any harm.

01:38:58.647 --> 01:39:00.565
What has she done to you?

01:39:08.866 --> 01:39:10.367
Get it off in a minute.

01:39:10.951 --> 01:39:13.536
Don't worry, Ms. Blanche.
I'll get you down from there.

01:39:17.248 --> 01:39:18.749
You just rest easy.

01:39:35.348 --> 01:39:37.266
Going out are you, dear?

01:39:39.727 --> 01:39:40.853
You know I am.

01:39:40.937 --> 01:39:42.855
Having dinner with her?

01:39:44.857 --> 01:39:46.942
I'm forgotten.

01:39:47.234 --> 01:39:50.737
Now you won't be back too late,
will you, lovey? Huh?

01:39:57.536 --> 01:39:59.329
Who knows?

01:40:16.928 --> 01:40:20.141
You could've been
better than all of 'em.

01:40:21.058 --> 01:40:23.727
But they didn't want that.

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.737
They just didn't love you enough.

01:40:36.447 --> 01:40:39.825
Do you know that?
They just didn't love you enough.

01:41:39.424 --> 01:41:41.551
I'm sorry, Edwin.

01:41:42.260 --> 01:41:44.637
I can't let you in.

01:41:45.346 --> 01:41:46.722
Not now.

01:42:02.444 --> 01:42:04.154
Go to hell!

01:42:15.039 --> 01:42:17.250
I can't let you in.

01:42:23.632 --> 01:42:25.258
Not now.

01:42:52.616 --> 01:42:56.120
What am I going to do?

01:45:11.831 --> 01:45:14.500
I thought... I didn't know
there was anyone in here.

01:45:15.501 --> 01:45:17.211
I just came home and saw a light...

01:45:17.503 --> 01:45:20.213
...and I thought perhaps you'd left
the lights of your car on.

01:45:20.505 --> 01:45:22.132
You know, I've had that happen to me.

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:23.633
That's all right, Mrs. Bates.

01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:27.220
I had that happen to me once,
it's no joke.

01:45:27.512 --> 01:45:30.306
Wake up in the morning and find
you've got a dead battery.

01:45:31.223 --> 01:45:32.307
No joke.

01:45:34.519 --> 01:45:37.230
Well, as long as everything's
all right...

01:45:38.397 --> 01:45:40.108
...I guess I'll just say good night.

01:45:40.317 --> 01:45:41.109
Good night.

01:47:33.923 --> 01:47:36.092
That doesn't prove anything.

01:47:36.092 --> 01:47:38.094
Now what do you think you'll do?

01:47:38.219 --> 01:47:40.012
I'll manage, lovey.

01:47:40.012 --> 01:47:41.430
I suppose you think
I'm making all this up.

01:47:41.513 --> 01:47:42.723
I wouldn't know.

01:47:43.015 --> 01:47:44.808
Well, Hazel should know, shouldn't she?

01:47:44.808 --> 01:47:47.310
She worked right in the same studio
and that's when it all happened.

01:47:47.519 --> 01:47:50.021
Just after one of those studio parties.

01:47:50.313 --> 01:47:52.023
And right in front of her own house.

01:47:52.315 --> 01:47:55.901
Jane Hudson drove a car straight at her
own sister and crippled her for life.

01:47:56.193 --> 01:47:58.028
Come on. You mean,
she tried to kill her?

01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:01.197
Yes, she did. She tried
to murder her own sister.

01:48:01.489 --> 01:48:03.408
How is it they didn't arrest her then?

01:48:03.616 --> 01:48:06.119
Oh, they would've, but the studio
had it all hushed up...

01:48:06.327 --> 01:48:08.205
...on account
of Blanche Hudson's career.

01:48:08.413 --> 01:48:09.915
That sounds very likely.

01:48:10.207 --> 01:48:12.917
Yes, doesn't it. So the fine woman
you've chosen to run around with...

01:48:13.002 --> 01:48:16.797
...turns out to be broke
and a murderer as well.

01:48:17.089 --> 01:48:18.006
Well, it's true.

01:48:18.090 --> 01:48:21.217
All right then, if it's true, I'll ask
her about it when I see her again.

01:48:21.426 --> 01:48:23.720
You wouldn't see a woman
like that again?

01:48:23.803 --> 01:48:25.805
Why not? You just told me,
she's got a rich sister.

01:48:25.888 --> 01:48:28.516
You haven't heard the worst of it yet.

01:48:28.807 --> 01:48:30.726
- You mean there's more?
- Yes, there is.

01:48:31.018 --> 01:48:35.397
After she'd run down her own sister,
your precious Jane Hudson ran off and...

01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:38.691
...left her there to die,
like some poor animal.

01:48:39.025 --> 01:48:42.194
She ran off and disappeared
for three whole days.

01:48:42.403 --> 01:48:44.905
So what happened then?
Don't tell me they couldn't find her.

01:48:45.197 --> 01:48:47.908
Oh, they found her all right.
They found her all right.

01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.494
They found her in some hotel room...

01:48:50.702 --> 01:48:52.997
...with a man that she'd
never even seen before.

01:48:53.289 --> 01:48:56.501
Why should that upset you?

01:48:57.502 --> 01:49:00.421
Isn't that how I was conceived?

01:49:25.402 --> 01:49:27.487
Yes, this is Ms. Hudson.

01:49:43.711 --> 01:49:45.587
She left.

01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:50.301
About a week ago.

01:49:51.719 --> 01:49:55.889
We have a report here, filed by her
cousin, listing her as a missing person.

01:49:56.181 --> 01:49:59.100
Did she tell you what her plans were,
anything like that?

01:50:01.311 --> 01:50:03.813
No, I don't know a thing.

01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:05.690
Well, we have a couple of
other addresses to check.

01:50:05.815 --> 01:50:07.316
Maybe we'll come up with something.

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:10.402
Otherwise, we'll probably be
getting in touch with you again.

01:50:10.611 --> 01:50:13.990
Meanwhile, if you do hear from her,
we would appreciate you letting us know.

01:50:43.684 --> 01:50:46.478
The police are looking for Elvira.

01:50:47.312 --> 01:50:48.397
It wasn't my fault.

01:50:48.688 --> 01:50:51.483
She wouldn't go away, you heard her,
she wouldn't leave me alone.

01:50:51.692 --> 01:50:55.404
I don't know what to do, Blanche.
What am I going to do?

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:02.702
What am I going to do?

01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:08.499
If they find her,
we'll have to run away.

01:51:08.791 --> 01:51:12.002
That's what we'll do.
We'll go away.

01:51:13.295 --> 01:51:16.089
Oh, but then I wouldn't
see Edwin anymore.

01:51:16.381 --> 01:51:18.800
He wouldn't like what I did.

01:51:19.092 --> 01:51:22.887
It wasn't my fault,
but he wouldn't like it.

01:51:24.096 --> 01:51:25.307
I don't care.

01:51:25.515 --> 01:51:27.100
We'll just go to the beach.

01:51:27.183 --> 01:51:29.477
We'll go and live at the seashore
all the time, like we used to...

01:51:30.102 --> 01:51:32.314
...when I was little
and Daddy was there.

01:51:32.481 --> 01:51:34.899
And maybe we'll have friends.

01:51:35.191 --> 01:51:38.694
People would come and see us.
Oh, I'd like that.

01:51:47.786 --> 01:51:49.788
Blanche, listen to me.

01:51:51.206 --> 01:51:53.875
You know, I always wanted
everything to be nice, don't you?

01:51:54.584 --> 01:51:57.586
I don't see how Elvira could
make me do a thing like that.

01:51:57.795 --> 01:51:59.797
I just don't understand.

01:52:00.297 --> 01:52:02.591
It was like that time
in the hotel room...

01:52:02.883 --> 01:52:06.678
...when they came and told me that
you were hurt and that I'd done it.

01:52:06.886 --> 01:52:10.306
And there was a big man there,
a policeman.

01:52:10.473 --> 01:52:12.476
And he hit me and
he slapped me and...

01:52:12.684 --> 01:52:16.313
...I tried to tell him that
I couldn't do a thing like that.

01:52:16.397 --> 01:52:18.774
Not to my own sister.

01:52:25.572 --> 01:52:27.782
He said I was a liar.

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:30.993
The accident, it...

01:52:31.911 --> 01:52:34.079
No, it wasn't an accident.

01:52:34.288 --> 01:52:37.708
I did it. You told me so yourself.

01:52:41.711 --> 01:52:43.504
I must tell you.

01:52:44.172 --> 01:52:46.299
I don't want to talk about it.

01:52:46.590 --> 01:52:49.885
Every time I think about something nice,
you remind me of all the bad things.

01:52:50.094 --> 01:52:52.805
I only want to talk about
the nice things.

01:52:58.394 --> 01:53:01.897
Remember when Daddy and I
used to rehearse at the beach?

01:53:03.399 --> 01:53:05.693
I'd be dancing on the sand...

01:53:06.402 --> 01:53:09.071
...and all the people
would come and watch...

01:53:09.571 --> 01:53:13.283
...all crowd around to see
Baby Jane Hudson.

01:53:23.375 --> 01:53:24.793
What'll I do?

01:53:25.794 --> 01:53:27.671
- Let them in.
- Oh, but what if...?

01:53:29.506 --> 01:53:31.509
It may be Edwin.

01:53:34.678 --> 01:53:37.472
Of course, Edwin.

01:53:47.481 --> 01:53:49.566
You want to make him tell on me.

01:54:16.092 --> 01:54:17.802
Wait for me!

01:54:28.478 --> 01:54:30.897
I'm sorry, Ms. Hudson but we just
picked up this young man...

01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:32.273
...in front of your house.

01:54:32.398 --> 01:54:34.567
Says he's on his way in
to see you. Is that right?

01:54:36.777 --> 01:54:38.195
I don't understand.

01:54:38.404 --> 01:54:40.489
They're trying to say I'm drunk.

01:54:40.781 --> 01:54:42.992
Let's just say you're
a little happy, okay?

01:54:43.201 --> 01:54:44.869
Who's happy?

01:54:45.369 --> 01:54:46.871
I'm not happy.

01:54:54.170 --> 01:54:55.296
So now you know.

01:54:56.172 --> 01:54:58.590
That's right. So now we know.

01:54:59.675 --> 01:55:01.802
Sorry to have bothered you,
Ms. Hudson. Good night.

01:55:26.198 --> 01:55:30.578
I have the money. Really, I have.
But don't be mean to me.

01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:32.498
You promised me.

01:55:32.498 --> 01:55:35.667
I know I did, and I have the money.

01:55:35.876 --> 01:55:39.462
Look, let's go in the kitchen
and have a drink together.

01:55:39.796 --> 01:55:41.172
It's nice there.
And then...

01:55:41.381 --> 01:55:44.300
...we can be friends again,
and everything.

01:55:44.884 --> 01:55:46.093
And everything...

01:55:46.469 --> 01:55:48.262
- I've got something else for you, too.
- What?

01:55:48.262 --> 01:55:51.264
It's a surprise. Would you like to...?

01:55:58.771 --> 01:56:00.690
You're gonna like your present.

01:56:02.983 --> 01:56:04.985
You're really gonna like it.

01:56:05.194 --> 01:56:06.987
Drink your drink, Edwin.

01:56:10.574 --> 01:56:12.993
I'll go and get it for you.

01:56:44.189 --> 01:56:46.482
This is my very own.

01:56:47.692 --> 01:56:50.570
It's a genuine Baby Jane Doll.

01:56:51.988 --> 01:56:55.074
I used to give them
to all my really good friends...

01:56:55.283 --> 01:56:58.161
...the people that I worked with.

01:56:58.494 --> 01:57:00.287
- They made them for me.
- Marvelous.

01:57:00.371 --> 01:57:01.789
Specially.

01:57:02.164 --> 01:57:03.791
Very lifelike.

01:57:04.083 --> 01:57:07.169
Now Jane, you talk
to nice Mr. Flagg, and...

01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:11.882
...nice Mr. Flagg will have
his money in a minute.

01:57:25.561 --> 01:57:28.690
Oh, you're not comfy
like that, are you?

01:57:46.372 --> 01:57:47.874
Shall we go bye-bye?

01:58:01.762 --> 01:58:04.056
Here comes the Super Chief.

01:58:16.776 --> 01:58:18.361
What was that?

01:58:18.486 --> 01:58:21.489
Nothing. Nothing.
I didn't do anything.

01:58:27.661 --> 01:58:30.289
She'll take you away from me.

01:58:40.965 --> 01:58:42.466
Please...

01:58:43.676 --> 01:58:44.885
...help me.

01:59:00.484 --> 01:59:02.277
She's dying.

01:59:04.363 --> 01:59:07.073
For God's sake.

01:59:09.075 --> 01:59:10.160
She's dying.

01:59:11.077 --> 01:59:13.371
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

01:59:15.372 --> 01:59:18.167
Edwin, I've got your money.

01:59:20.585 --> 01:59:22.963
Edwin, you forgot your money!

01:59:32.764 --> 01:59:34.682
He hates me.

01:59:40.856 --> 01:59:42.857
He hates me.

02:00:06.754 --> 02:00:09.174
He's going to tell.

02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:35.365
You've got to help me.

02:00:36.157 --> 02:00:38.159
We've got to leave.

02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:43.163
Please, Blanche.

02:00:45.082 --> 02:00:47.752
Help me, please.

02:03:13.763 --> 02:03:16.224
I like this place.

02:03:16.432 --> 02:03:19.060
We can just sit here for a while.

02:03:19.226 --> 02:03:23.147
And pretty soon the sun will
come up and it will be nice.

02:03:24.731 --> 02:03:27.151
You should look at the sea.

02:03:27.443 --> 02:03:30.362
It has all lights on it.

02:03:30.738 --> 02:03:33.031
You used to like that.

02:04:01.349 --> 02:04:04.352
We interrupt this program to bring you
a special news bulletin.

02:04:04.561 --> 02:04:07.439
At 11:25 this morning all local
law-enforcement agencies...

02:04:07.523 --> 02:04:08.857
...had assigned special details...

02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:12.652
...to the kidnap-slaying mystery that
surrounds the famed Hudson sisters.

02:04:12.944 --> 02:04:15.822
It is believed that Blanche Hudson,
film great of the early Thirties...

02:04:16.155 --> 02:04:18.157
...has been forcibly abducted
by her sister...

02:04:18.157 --> 02:04:20.242
...former child star,
Baby Jane Hudson...

02:04:20.451 --> 02:04:22.828
...from the family home on
Northwood Avenue in Hollywood...

02:04:22.953 --> 02:04:26.331
...sometime between the hours of
10:00 p.m. And 10:30 p.m. Last evening.

02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:28.833
With the exception of one witness...

02:04:28.958 --> 02:04:32.753
...who reportedly saw the Hudson car,
a 1940 or 1941 black convertible...

02:04:32.921 --> 02:04:35.257
...heading west on Wilshire
and Santa Monica...

02:04:35.549 --> 02:04:38.051
...no report has been received.

02:05:07.036 --> 02:05:09.038
I see you found that colored woman.

02:05:09.246 --> 02:05:10.456
They found her all right.

02:05:10.831 --> 02:05:13.750
Sure is a rotten way to get
your picture in the papers.

02:05:14.251 --> 02:05:16.753
You reckon you'll ever find that
Baby Jane, or whatever her name is?

02:05:17.045 --> 02:05:20.131
Sure, we'll find her.
But I guess maybe it'll be too late.

02:05:56.749 --> 02:05:59.752
Oh, officer, there's a car down there
parked right out in the road.

02:06:00.044 --> 02:06:02.337
I almost got stuck in the sand
when I tried to get around it.

02:06:03.046 --> 02:06:05.633
- You mean that old Lincoln convertible?
- That's right.

02:06:06.050 --> 02:06:09.053
That was parked there when
we opened up this morning.

02:06:09.428 --> 02:06:11.848
The keys are there, but I didn't want
to move it. I thought maybe...

02:06:14.142 --> 02:06:15.434
How do you figure?

02:06:15.726 --> 02:06:18.145
Cops. How do you figure cops?

02:06:32.325 --> 02:06:33.325
This is it.

02:07:05.648 --> 02:07:07.441
You must be hot.

02:07:15.323 --> 02:07:16.825
Help me.

02:07:18.535 --> 02:07:20.119
I'm afraid.

02:07:25.333 --> 02:07:27.210
Find someone...

02:07:28.711 --> 02:07:29.629
...a doctor.

02:07:30.213 --> 02:07:31.839
I can't.

02:07:34.425 --> 02:07:35.926
If I die...

02:07:38.345 --> 02:07:39.638
...you'll be alone.

02:07:39.846 --> 02:07:41.931
But they'd be mean to me,
like they were before.

02:07:43.433 --> 02:07:45.309
They'll be kind.

02:07:47.311 --> 02:07:49.230
I don't want to hear.

02:07:51.024 --> 02:07:52.609
Jane, I'm dying.

02:07:54.027 --> 02:07:56.320
There's no time.

02:07:57.029 --> 02:07:59.031
You must listen.

02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:01.241
I made you...

02:08:01.742 --> 02:08:03.911
...waste your whole life...

02:08:05.121 --> 02:08:07.706
...thinking you'd crippled me.

02:08:07.915 --> 02:08:09.625
Please, stop.

02:08:11.710 --> 02:08:14.337
You didn't do it.

02:08:16.714 --> 02:08:19.133
I did it myself.

02:08:21.010 --> 02:08:23.012
Don't you understand?

02:08:24.638 --> 02:08:27.933
I crippled myself.

02:08:28.934 --> 02:08:30.227
You weren't driving...

02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:32.228
...that night.

02:08:59.713 --> 02:09:02.215
You weren't driving.

02:09:03.633 --> 02:09:05.510
You were too drunk.

02:09:05.802 --> 02:09:08.012
I wouldn't let you drive.

02:09:09.931 --> 02:09:12.808
I made you go open the gates.

02:09:13.225 --> 02:09:15.936
I watched you get out of the car.

02:09:17.312 --> 02:09:20.315
You'd been so cruel to me at the party.

02:09:21.441 --> 02:09:23.110
Imitating me...

02:09:23.611 --> 02:09:26.113
...making people laugh at me.

02:09:26.905 --> 02:09:29.325
I watched you get out of the car and...

02:09:30.826 --> 02:09:33.412
...I wanted to run you down...

02:09:33.704 --> 02:09:35.539
...crush you.

02:09:36.206 --> 02:09:38.625
You saw the car coming.

02:09:41.211 --> 02:09:43.212
I hit the gates.

02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:51.011
Snapped my spine.

02:09:52.512 --> 02:09:54.306
Then, you mean...

02:09:57.308 --> 02:10:01.437
...all this time
we could've been friends?

02:10:03.023 --> 02:10:07.026
You were frightened and ran away.

02:10:08.903 --> 02:10:12.907
I managed to crawl out
of the car and up to the gates.

02:10:13.616 --> 02:10:15.617
When they found me...

02:10:16.326 --> 02:10:19.122
...they assumed it was your fault.

02:10:21.624 --> 02:10:25.127
Oh, you were so drunk and confused.

02:10:25.419 --> 02:10:27.337
You didn't know any better.

02:10:31.633 --> 02:10:34.218
You weren't ugly then.

02:10:35.303 --> 02:10:37.596
I made you that way.

02:10:39.223 --> 02:10:41.935
I even did that.

02:10:44.437 --> 02:10:47.398
There's a place up there
that sells things.

02:10:50.734 --> 02:10:52.903
You like ice cream.

02:10:56.197 --> 02:10:58.199
I'll get you some.

02:11:12.630 --> 02:11:14.131
Do you have ice cream?

02:11:14.298 --> 02:11:15.215
Yes, what flavor?

02:11:18.802 --> 02:11:21.221
Vanilla, coffee, strawberry, lemon...

02:11:21.514 --> 02:11:24.600
Strawberry. Strawberry, please.
Two big strawberries, please.

02:11:34.317 --> 02:11:36.902
- That'll be forty cents.
- Thanks.

02:11:38.821 --> 02:11:41.907
Right. You better send some more help.

02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:54.209
We've been looking all over for you.

02:11:54.793 --> 02:11:56.796
I'm sorry, but we must find your sister.

02:12:01.218 --> 02:12:02.928
Is she down here on the beach with you?

02:12:03.428 --> 02:12:05.305
- Yes, she is.
- I'll take these for you.

02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:08.599
Oh, no, they're mine.
They're for my sister, Blanche.

02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:11.018
She's going to be
a movie star, you know.

02:12:11.602 --> 02:12:12.603
That's right, miss.

02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:16.398
We want to find your sister, because
I think maybe she needs help.

02:12:16.606 --> 02:12:18.024
I think maybe she's in trouble.

02:12:18.024 --> 02:12:20.402
Won't you show us where she is, please?

02:12:20.902 --> 02:12:23.529
Won't you take us to her?
Please, Ms. Hudson.
