WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:05.217
DUCKY: Cause of death--
a single wound to the ensign's

00:05.260 --> 00:07.739
carotid artery
with a wide blade.

00:07.782 --> 00:09.913
Why the ensign?Well, they were
trying to recruit

00:09.956 --> 00:12.347
Layna Korkmaz.
Ensign Wilt got in the way.

00:12.391 --> 00:14.130
I got talked into joining
this other chat room,

00:14.173 --> 00:16.956
only nobody there was
talking movies or music.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.478
What were they talking about?Asking if I was
lonely and...

00:19.521 --> 00:21.652
did I know my calling.Messages from who?

00:21.695 --> 00:23.652
The crazy people.
GIBBS:
Terrorist group.

00:23.695 --> 00:25.217
According to the chat room
support site,

00:25.260 --> 00:28.000
Hellbent427 is Bradley Simek.

00:28.043 --> 00:30.782
ABBY: He's got a bomb. The kid
has gunpowder on his computer,

00:30.826 --> 00:32.956
and a blueprint
for a plastic detonator.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
He printed a detonator. GIBBS:
Don't!

01:06.434 --> 01:07.782
Ten minutes.

01:07.826 --> 01:09.869
What?

01:09.913 --> 01:11.478
That's what you're
thinking, right?

01:11.521 --> 01:14.782
I mean, ten minutes earlier,
and we could've stopped him

01:14.826 --> 01:16.652
from ever
leaving his house.

01:16.695 --> 01:18.347
None of this
would've happened.

01:18.391 --> 01:20.652
I was thinking five.

01:22.695 --> 01:25.086
Hospital listed all
other injuries as minor.

01:25.130 --> 01:26.956
Could've been worse.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.043
16-year-old kid blows himself up
on a bus,

01:30.086 --> 01:32.695
and it could've been worse.

01:32.739 --> 01:35.086
Yeah.

01:37.086 --> 01:38.956
All right, Simek's
mother's been notified.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.304
You think he was being
straight with you?
Who?

01:41.347 --> 01:42.869
The kid. Simek.

01:42.913 --> 01:45.043
Said he didn't kill Ensign Wilt.
We believe him?

01:45.086 --> 01:47.652
Some sick bastard
on the other end of a computer,

01:47.695 --> 01:49.086
putting ideas
into kid's head.

01:49.130 --> 01:51.478
You tell me how we get
a hold of that guy!

01:51.521 --> 01:52.782
Dorney's into it
with Cyber.

01:52.826 --> 01:54.739
I want a full report ASAP!

01:54.782 --> 01:55.608
Roger that.

01:55.652 --> 01:57.043
Okay, I got it.

01:57.086 --> 02:00.217
Duck.
Uh, the boy's right
arm was obliterated

02:00.260 --> 02:01.956
when he detonated the bomb.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
The rest of his mutilated
body ended up there.

02:05.043 --> 02:07.956
But he was convinced
somehow, in all of this,

02:08.000 --> 02:11.391
that there was dignity
in his martyrdom.

02:11.434 --> 02:13.608
Let's get him out of here.Strange.

02:13.652 --> 02:16.173
What?
Strange.

02:16.217 --> 02:18.173
These marks
on his arm.

02:18.217 --> 02:21.826
I noted them as burns,
but on closer inspection,

02:21.869 --> 02:23.956
they appear to be
in a pattern.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.130
A tattoo?
Possibly.

02:26.173 --> 02:28.260
Yeah, this design is familiar.

02:28.304 --> 02:29.913
TONY:
Hey, excuse me, ma'am.

02:29.956 --> 02:31.173
Behind the yellow... Hey!

02:31.217 --> 02:32.956
Get behind the tape!

02:33.000 --> 02:35.391
What are you thinking?

02:50.782 --> 02:52.391
What happened?
Did you see something?

02:54.913 --> 02:57.739
I don't know.

03:34.043 --> 03:35.043
Hi.

03:35.086 --> 03:36.304
Hello.

03:36.347 --> 03:37.478
[laughs]
What you doing?

03:37.521 --> 03:39.260
I'm about to head into MTAC.

03:39.304 --> 03:43.000
Oh, that's right, 'cause Gibbs
asked for that cyber update.

03:43.043 --> 03:44.391
McGEE:
That's right. Wow, so,

03:44.434 --> 03:45.869
you're not only doing

03:45.913 --> 03:47.652
your first MTAC briefing.
You are running the show.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.217
Yup. I'll see you in there.

03:49.260 --> 03:50.956
Oh, I'm not going in there.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.478
Place is scary.

03:52.521 --> 03:53.826
Tim will give me
an update later.

03:53.869 --> 03:57.043
And a word to the wise--
I would empty my bladder

03:57.086 --> 03:58.304
before I go in there,

03:58.347 --> 03:59.565
'cause it's the scariest
place on Earth.

03:59.608 --> 04:01.608
We've seen good agents
wet themselves bad.

04:01.652 --> 04:04.695
It's very true.
And the carpet stains, so...

04:04.739 --> 04:06.869
Look, guys,

04:06.913 --> 04:09.826
I appreciate the pep talk,
but I'm fine.

04:09.869 --> 04:12.304
Stressful situations
don't get to me anymore.

04:12.347 --> 04:14.565
Since when?
Okay.

04:14.608 --> 04:16.913
I'll tell you this because
I'm confident enough to do so,

04:16.956 --> 04:18.608
but, also, because
it might help you, too.

04:18.652 --> 04:19.956
Two words:

04:20.000 --> 04:21.217
alter ego.

04:21.260 --> 04:24.304
Whenever I'm feeling
overwhelmed,

04:24.347 --> 04:27.086
I mentally transition
into a better version of myself.

04:27.130 --> 04:28.869
You mean like BeyoncÃ©
and Sasha Fierce?

04:28.913 --> 04:30.565
I was thinking more like

04:30.608 --> 04:32.565
Clark Kent and Superman,
but, yeah, same idea.

04:32.608 --> 04:33.478
That's fantastic.

04:33.521 --> 04:34.956
It is.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.695
I transitioned
right before you walked up.

04:36.739 --> 04:39.043
That is why your B.S.
is not getting to me.

04:39.086 --> 04:40.869
So, right now, who
are we talking to?

04:40.913 --> 04:44.826
Gilroy Libbs, Super Agent,
ready to kick some MTAC ass.

04:44.869 --> 04:47.782
Huh.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
First time with the eye scanner.
Child's play.

04:54.478 --> 04:56.782
Did you see him do
that eye scanner?

04:56.826 --> 04:59.000
First time I did it--
14 tries.

04:59.043 --> 05:00.521
Gilroy Libbs is kind of awesome.

05:00.565 --> 05:02.347
Yeah.

05:02.391 --> 05:04.956
NCIS Cyber linked Bradley
Simek's communications

05:05.000 --> 05:07.130
to several anonymous
recruiters.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.000
I want names.

05:08.043 --> 05:09.478
And we'll get them.

05:09.521 --> 05:11.478
For now, we were able
to tie the recruiters

05:11.521 --> 05:12.956
to a specific terror cell.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.173
Vice President?

05:14.217 --> 05:15.608
MAN: Agent Dorneget
brought us together

05:15.652 --> 05:17.043
to pool our intel on the cell.

05:17.086 --> 05:19.652
After all, this is
an international epidemic.

05:19.695 --> 05:22.000
MAN 2: Group in question
is gaining notoriety

05:22.043 --> 05:24.739
under a number
of calling cards worldwide.

05:24.782 --> 05:28.130
[speaking foreign language]

05:28.173 --> 05:30.521
Or simply translated:
"The Calling."

05:30.565 --> 05:33.260
Where are they?HASSAN: The heart
of the cell is in Iraq,

05:33.304 --> 05:34.739
but their reach is unlimited
and focused.

05:34.782 --> 05:37.478
MAN 1:
Calling is making a strong push

05:37.521 --> 05:38.652
to recruit children.

05:38.695 --> 05:41.173
On the Internet.
Exactly.

05:41.217 --> 05:43.173
They're employing chat rooms,

05:43.217 --> 05:45.391
first-person shooter games,
even cartoons,

05:45.434 --> 05:47.826
in an effort to weaponize
children as young as ten.

05:47.869 --> 05:50.695
The younger they are, the
less they look like a threat.

05:50.739 --> 05:52.173
And the cell's mission?

05:52.217 --> 05:54.130
They see themselves
as underdogs,

05:54.173 --> 05:56.304
standing against
their oppressors.

05:56.347 --> 05:59.347
Essentially, The Calling is
a twisted Peter Pan

05:59.391 --> 06:01.913
recruiting an international band
of Lost Boys.

06:01.956 --> 06:04.260
It's a good metaphor.Thank you.

06:04.304 --> 06:06.130
SALI: Interpol is assembling
an emergency think tank

06:06.173 --> 06:07.913
to create a plan
to stop The Calling's

06:07.956 --> 06:09.391
online recruitment of youth.

06:09.434 --> 06:11.086
GIRARD: May I interrupt
with a development?

06:11.130 --> 06:12.521
Go.

06:12.565 --> 06:13.695
We've sent you background

06:13.739 --> 06:15.608
on a Calling leader
here in France.

06:15.652 --> 06:18.869
He does facilitate communication
within the cell.

06:18.913 --> 06:20.913
His name is Matthew Rousseau.

06:20.956 --> 06:21.826
We're looking at him.

06:21.869 --> 06:23.173
My team has intercepted

06:23.217 --> 06:24.608
several e-mails to him

06:24.652 --> 06:26.304
from the United States.

06:26.347 --> 06:27.913
Do you have a location?

06:27.956 --> 06:30.869
No, but we were able to decrypt
some content. It appears

06:30.913 --> 06:33.434
several Calling loyalists
in the U.S.

06:33.478 --> 06:36.652
are seeking S-mines
on the black market.

06:36.695 --> 06:39.000
Meaning what?

06:39.043 --> 06:41.043
ABBY:
An S-mine, or a Bouncing Betty,

06:41.086 --> 06:43.695
was a land mine used
by Germany in WWII.

06:43.739 --> 06:46.304
When triggered, it shoots into
the air, and then, it detonates.

06:46.347 --> 06:48.913
It's like a shrapnel
shower, Gibbs.I know what it does, Abbs.

06:48.956 --> 06:50.695
I want to know
if you can still get 'em.

06:50.739 --> 06:51.869
Yeah, I mean, if you have,

06:51.913 --> 06:54.043
like, a really scary friend.

06:54.086 --> 06:56.826
Like a super creepy,
corner-lurking,

06:56.869 --> 06:58.652
black-market friend.Why go to the trouble?

06:58.695 --> 07:02.565
All I know is, if The Calling
wants these S-mines so bad,

07:02.608 --> 07:03.652
I don't think
they're gonna use them

07:03.695 --> 07:05.478
for, like, bookends.

07:05.521 --> 07:06.913
How do we find the guys
that are looking for them?

07:06.956 --> 07:09.956
I was hoping you had an idea.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.652
[sighs]

07:11.695 --> 07:12.956
You have an idea, don't you?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.434
No.

07:14.478 --> 07:17.521
But I got a scary friend.

07:20.565 --> 07:21.565
Agent Gibbs.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.739
How wonderful
to see you again.

07:25.826 --> 07:28.826
I must say, you're looking
handsomely tortured as ever.

07:30.695 --> 07:32.956
I had my heart set
on a wine list.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.869
I highly recommend
the fries, Bayar.

07:36.913 --> 07:39.565
So, now comes the part
where I say, "Please,

07:39.608 --> 07:41.608
"we've been through
too much together.

07:41.652 --> 07:44.478
Call me Agah." You nod,

07:44.521 --> 07:46.478
and then, we both smile
at something that isn't funny.

07:46.521 --> 07:47.652
Let's skip that.

07:47.695 --> 07:50.000
Agreed. Now to a positive.

07:50.043 --> 07:52.695
Which is... I forgive you.

07:55.260 --> 07:56.739
You've hurt my feelings
in the past,

07:56.782 --> 07:58.652
but absolution's good
for the soul.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.826
I'm looking to make a deal.

08:01.869 --> 08:03.826
I'd hoped.

08:03.869 --> 08:05.869
German S-mines are being chased
on the black market.

08:05.913 --> 08:07.652
I want to know
who's doing the chasing.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.217
And you think I can tell you.

08:09.260 --> 08:11.478
I think you can find out.

08:11.521 --> 08:14.652
Black-market weapons--
that's your wheelhouse.

08:16.652 --> 08:20.782
The people in my, uh...
wheelhouse are like you.

08:20.826 --> 08:25.347
Resourceful,
sour and armed.

08:25.391 --> 08:27.565
If I ask a question,
I can't take it back.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.782
Your neck is your concern,
not mine.

08:29.826 --> 08:32.652
The terms will be fair.

08:32.695 --> 08:36.695
You'll be paid the same
as when you work with the DIA.

08:37.913 --> 08:40.608
Okay.

08:40.652 --> 08:42.782
So, tell me, Gibbsey.

08:42.826 --> 08:45.739
Are you making a deal
with the devil,

08:45.782 --> 08:47.434
or am I?

09:00.869 --> 09:02.000
[music playing]Ducky?

09:02.043 --> 09:04.304
Oh, hello, Jethro.

09:04.347 --> 09:07.000
You get a new 45?

09:07.043 --> 09:08.869
No, Gibbs.
It's my Lab Jams.

09:08.913 --> 09:10.130
Don't you recognize it?

09:10.173 --> 09:11.565
Not in here.

09:11.608 --> 09:13.695
Yes, well, Abby and I have
joined forces for a moment.

09:13.739 --> 09:15.391
She was kind enough
to show me

09:15.434 --> 09:18.652
how energizing a little bit
of bass can be.

09:18.695 --> 09:21.347
Yes, sir!
I could totally
hook you up

09:21.391 --> 09:23.173
with some Lab Jams for
the squad room if you want.

09:23.217 --> 09:26.086
No.
Okay.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.652
Then how about
we just dazzle you?

09:27.695 --> 09:29.260
Yeah, I like that.

09:29.304 --> 09:32.043
Yes, well, might I draw
your attention to...

09:32.086 --> 09:34.304
the design on
Bradley Simek's arm.

09:34.347 --> 09:36.347
ABBY: It's not a tattoo.
It's permanent marker.

09:36.391 --> 09:39.130
And the angle suggests that
he drew it on there himself.

09:39.173 --> 09:40.043
You remember
where you saw it, Duck?

09:40.086 --> 09:41.173
Yes.

09:41.217 --> 09:43.173
Former Army Specialist
Randall White.

09:43.217 --> 09:45.043
If you recall,

09:45.086 --> 09:47.173
four months ago,
he and two of his colleagues

09:47.217 --> 09:50.043
tried to assassinate
a visiting imam.

09:50.086 --> 09:51.086
They were Americans.ABBY:
Yeah.

09:51.130 --> 09:52.347
But they were radicalized

09:52.391 --> 09:53.956
by a terror cell in Syria.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
This is one of the autopsy
photographs I took

09:57.043 --> 09:59.086
of White's identifying mark.

09:59.130 --> 10:01.043
It's a real tattoo.

10:01.086 --> 10:02.956
GIBBS:
Same design as Simek's.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.086
Now, remember, Bradley
Simek's detonator

10:05.130 --> 10:07.086
was downloaded
from the Dark Web,

10:07.130 --> 10:09.782
and then, it was created
on a 3-D printer.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.826
Just like the plastic gun

10:11.869 --> 10:14.086
that Randall White used
to kill himself.

10:14.130 --> 10:16.608
Gibbs, The Calling

10:16.652 --> 10:19.000
is connected to
the same group

10:19.043 --> 10:22.043
that recruited the
three Americans in Syria.

10:22.086 --> 10:23.347
White's dead.
Where are the other two?

10:23.391 --> 10:25.956
Well, Kyle Nasry died
in prison two months ago.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
The third terrorist...

10:28.043 --> 10:30.478
is very much alive.

10:30.521 --> 10:32.043
BISHOP:
Gibbs.

10:32.086 --> 10:35.043
Hey, Bishop,
bring in Sarah Goode.

10:35.086 --> 10:38.217
Gentlemen, as you know, Interpol
is assembling a think tank.

10:38.260 --> 10:41.434
I would like you
to represent NCIS.

10:41.478 --> 10:43.000
Both of you.

10:44.173 --> 10:45.347
Okay, where
we headed?

10:45.391 --> 10:47.086
The sessions will be hosted

10:47.130 --> 10:50.000
by GID Officer Hassan
in Cairo.

10:50.043 --> 10:51.956
[laughs]
Egypt?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.130
Plane leaves in two hours.

10:53.173 --> 10:55.869
[chuckles]

10:55.913 --> 10:56.869
Well, it looks like
you told him.

10:56.913 --> 10:58.739
Yeah. Wow.

10:58.782 --> 11:01.956
Repping NCIS on an international
platform is a huge honor.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.434
Deserved.Thank you. I...

11:05.086 --> 11:07.869
Excuse me. I got excited.

11:07.913 --> 11:10.739
Dorney, what
are you doing?I wasn't thinking.

11:10.782 --> 11:12.130
I should've been
more Gilroy Libbs.

11:12.956 --> 11:14.000
Who is Gilroy Libbs?

11:15.086 --> 11:17.043
No one.

11:19.043 --> 11:22.217
Okay. Off to Cairo. Thanks.

11:30.086 --> 11:32.043
[door shuts]

11:32.086 --> 11:33.260
Don't like that look.

11:33.304 --> 11:35.043
Yeah. Something's come up.

11:35.086 --> 11:38.217
Bayar?Yeah, the deal
isn't gonna fly, Gibbs.

11:38.260 --> 11:40.217
DIA got wind of it.
They shut it down.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.913
Yeah. It's not their call.But it is.

11:42.956 --> 11:44.521
SecDef is backing them.

11:44.565 --> 11:47.043
They got Bayar locked
into two ops already.

11:47.086 --> 11:48.826
They don't want him compromised.Director,

11:48.869 --> 11:49.956
we need him on this.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.347
It's done, Gibbs.

11:51.391 --> 11:53.956
Using Agah Bayar is a no go.

11:56.130 --> 11:57.913
I want to talk to
you about the Calling.

11:57.956 --> 12:00.304
You connected them
to me?
Yes.

12:00.347 --> 12:02.000
That's disappointing.TONY:
Look,

12:02.043 --> 12:04.956
as much as we all love
crypto-terrorist talk,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.956
we need to know everything
you know about The Calling.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.347
So what's it gonna
take to get there?We're already there.

12:10.391 --> 12:13.913
The Calling began as part
of the group I joined in Syria.

12:13.956 --> 12:15.826
But it became
something else.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.826
What?A faction eager
to bring chaos.

12:18.869 --> 12:20.478
They pushed
our religious doctrine aside.

12:20.521 --> 12:22.913
They're rooted in nothing but
the desire to reject authority

12:22.956 --> 12:24.434
and paralyze the system.

12:24.478 --> 12:25.956
Misguided youth...

12:26.000 --> 12:26.956
The faction broke off

12:27.000 --> 12:28.086
and moved its followers to Iraq.

12:28.130 --> 12:29.347
And now they're
everywhere.

12:29.391 --> 12:31.869
Overshadowing
the one true way.

12:31.913 --> 12:33.956
I want them stopped
as badly as you do.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.782
Just tell me how to help.

12:35.826 --> 12:37.826
Names. Anyone who's a member.

12:37.869 --> 12:39.956
Our group is winning back
young people by the day.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.782
I can't risk exposing those
who've found their way home.

12:42.826 --> 12:44.739
These are

12:44.782 --> 12:47.086
chat room discussions between
several Calling recruiters

12:47.130 --> 12:50.000
and a boy named
Brad Simek.

12:50.043 --> 12:52.391
Kid blew himself up
for the cause two days ago.

12:54.826 --> 12:56.869
I know this screen name.

12:56.913 --> 12:58.913
SSÃ³_BUILDER-48.

12:58.956 --> 13:01.608
Who is it?He was with us
for a time

13:01.652 --> 13:02.826
but was wooed by The Calling.

13:02.869 --> 13:05.347
He's a brilliant engineer--
a prodigy.

13:05.391 --> 13:07.826
His emotional growth took
a backseat to his studies,

13:07.869 --> 13:10.739
so he relates to youth.
He's a powerful recruiter.

13:10.782 --> 13:12.956
He called himself
The Builder,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.913
a builder of bombs
and of a people.

13:14.956 --> 13:16.304
Do you know
his real name?

13:16.347 --> 13:18.956
The "SS" stands for Sadiq Samar.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.086
That's
his real name.

13:21.130 --> 13:22.956
If you find him...

13:23.000 --> 13:24.391
end him.

13:28.869 --> 13:30.130
TONY:
Okay, here we go.

13:30.173 --> 13:32.217
Sadiq Samar, 25.

13:32.260 --> 13:35.739
U.S. citizen and resident
Pied Piper for the Calling.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.043
Got his master's degree
in engineering

13:37.086 --> 13:38.869
at the ripe old age
of 19.

13:38.913 --> 13:40.956
He was arrested two years ago
during a protest

13:41.000 --> 13:42.478
of U.S.
foreign policy.

13:42.521 --> 13:44.739
Where is he now?No idea. Doesn't
hold down a job.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.434
But his last known address
was an apartment building

13:47.478 --> 13:48.434
that is now being rented
by a newlywed couple

13:48.478 --> 13:50.391
and their three pugs.

13:50.434 --> 13:52.000
Got something.Go.

13:52.043 --> 13:53.826
Last year,
a Sal Roberts purchased

13:53.869 --> 13:56.000
a small building in DC.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.956
Down payment came out
of Samar's bank account.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.826
And I can't find any other
record on this Roberts guy.

14:01.869 --> 14:03.565
Samar bought the building
under an alias.

14:03.608 --> 14:05.347
You got an address?Got it.

14:05.391 --> 14:06.000
Let's go.

14:10.869 --> 14:13.391
Upstairs is clear.

14:13.434 --> 14:16.869
It's always nice when someone
keeps a place up to code.

14:28.521 --> 14:31.043
It's a bayonet.

14:31.086 --> 14:33.869
Looks like the others
from Simek's house.

14:33.913 --> 14:35.217
BISHOP:
It's dried blood.

14:35.260 --> 14:37.217
Could be the weapon
used to kill Ensign Wilt.

14:37.260 --> 14:40.391
Maybe Brad was telling the truth
when he said he didn't do it.

14:40.434 --> 14:44.000
Brad gives the knife to Samar,
Samar does the dirty work.

14:44.043 --> 14:45.869
Lost boys...

14:45.913 --> 14:48.913
[shuffling in distance]

14:57.391 --> 14:58.826
Federal agents!

15:09.086 --> 15:10.347
You all right?

15:10.391 --> 15:12.782
You're safe.
Come on out.

15:16.565 --> 15:17.217
Gun.

15:22.086 --> 15:23.782
You were at the bus.

15:23.826 --> 15:25.217
What's your
name, son?

15:25.260 --> 15:26.652
Whoa.

15:27.869 --> 15:29.086
You want to hand that to me?

15:33.130 --> 15:35.217
Okay. I'll come to you.

15:37.086 --> 15:39.173
Easy.

15:41.260 --> 15:42.347
Stay where
you are.

15:44.086 --> 15:45.086
Nice and easy.

15:46.086 --> 15:48.521
Okay. Got it.

15:51.086 --> 15:52.521
Clear.

15:52.565 --> 15:55.260
TONY: Use the zip
ties, Bishop.

15:55.304 --> 15:56.913
He's too small for handcuffs.

16:06.521 --> 16:10.000
Luke Harris, right?

16:10.043 --> 16:14.000
Your parents reported you
missing last night, Luke.

16:14.043 --> 16:16.869
What were you doing
in the building?

16:19.869 --> 16:24.260
You know a guy by the
name of Sadiq Samar?

16:27.956 --> 16:32.130
You know, I don't
like to talk either.

16:32.173 --> 16:34.652
You talk too much,
people end up thinking

16:34.695 --> 16:37.478
they heard things
you never said.

16:37.521 --> 16:41.173
But if you don't speak up,
I can't help you.

16:45.913 --> 16:49.739
Whatever you got mixed up in,
you can turn it around.

16:54.130 --> 16:57.304
Think for yourself.

16:57.347 --> 17:00.260
Make a choice.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.130
BISHOP:
He's just a kid.

17:17.173 --> 17:18.826
What have we got?Abby confirmed the bayonet

17:18.869 --> 17:20.565
was used to kill Ensign Wilt.

17:20.608 --> 17:23.173
Partial print in blood
was a match to Samar.

17:23.217 --> 17:25.391
Cold-blooded killer. The Builder
is adding to his rÃ©sumÃ©.

17:25.434 --> 17:27.217
I want to hear
about this kid.

17:27.260 --> 17:30.173
Luke Harris. Wendy and David
Harris of Great Falls, Virginia,

17:30.217 --> 17:33.173
reported him missing last night.
They are his adoptive parents.

17:33.217 --> 17:36.391
His biological parents were
originally from Iraq but fled

17:36.434 --> 17:38.782
to Turkey
after the First Gulf War.

17:38.826 --> 17:40.434
TONY: Put him up for adoption
shortly after he was born.

17:40.478 --> 17:42.347
BISHOP:
Uh, Abby got his laptop
from the police,

17:42.391 --> 17:43.739
but she was pulled
into something else,

17:43.782 --> 17:46.217
so she asked us
to read you her findings.

17:46.260 --> 17:47.347
So read 'em.

17:47.391 --> 17:48.782
Yep. Okay.

17:48.826 --> 17:50.956
"Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs."

17:52.086 --> 17:53.695
Uh...

17:53.739 --> 17:55.913
"Luke was communicating with
Samar and other Calling members

17:55.956 --> 17:58.217
in a new chat room
on the Dark Web. Click."

17:58.260 --> 17:59.217
Oh, click.

17:59.260 --> 18:01.217
BISHOP:
"A tool known as TOR,

18:01.260 --> 18:02.347
"or the Onion Router,
makes it impossible

18:02.391 --> 18:04.913
to track who's
accessing the site."

18:04.956 --> 18:06.565
Skip to the part I care about.

18:06.608 --> 18:08.304
Oh, my God. She knew
you were gonna say that.

18:08.347 --> 18:09.347
Word for word.
Right there.

18:09.391 --> 18:10.521
It says, "Skip..."Yeah.

18:11.739 --> 18:13.086
Uh...Oh.

18:13.130 --> 18:15.478
"For added protection,
Samar constantly hops

18:15.521 --> 18:19.913
to new chat rooms.""In fact, this new chat room
is already inactive.

18:19.956 --> 18:23.521
"I mean, it's as dead as Sister
Rosita's bowling game, Gibbs.

18:23.565 --> 18:26.347
She had hip surgery
last week." Oh.

18:26.391 --> 18:29.000
"End of findings.
Click." Click.

18:29.043 --> 18:31.304
BISHOP:
We combed through the chat
room's content. It confirms

18:31.347 --> 18:32.913
Luke learned
about Simek bombing the bus

18:32.956 --> 18:34.652
shortly after it happened.

18:34.695 --> 18:36.739
He was at the crime scene
because he was curious.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.000
Later, Samar told Luke to go
to the building to...

18:39.043 --> 18:41.086
"meet his brothers."

18:41.130 --> 18:43.695
Gibbs, Luke has to know
how to contact Samar.

18:43.739 --> 18:45.608
We need to get him to talk.

18:45.652 --> 18:48.478
Hey, Gibbs. I'm really bummed
that I wasn't there

18:48.521 --> 18:50.478
to report my findings
to you earlier,

18:50.521 --> 18:52.478
but I was busy
finding other findings.

18:52.521 --> 18:54.478
What's with the umbrella?

18:54.521 --> 18:56.173
You know Poppy.

18:56.217 --> 18:57.869
She's my parasol.

18:57.913 --> 19:00.043
She goes with me every time
I leave the building

19:00.086 --> 19:03.173
and go outside. But we'll
get back to her in a minute.

19:03.217 --> 19:06.173
First, I want to talk to you
about my friend Emilio Evans.

19:06.217 --> 19:08.913
He works for the Crestwell
Historical Society in DC.

19:08.956 --> 19:11.434
What about him?He has
a perfectly symmetrical face.

19:11.478 --> 19:13.130
Kind of blows my mind.

19:13.173 --> 19:16.782
And he has access to a lot
of useful historical documents.

19:16.826 --> 19:18.130
What'd you find?

19:19.913 --> 19:23.391
When Samar bought the building,
it was in shambles.

19:23.434 --> 19:25.826
He paid way more for
it than it was worth.

19:25.869 --> 19:29.782
And Emilio and his
snowflake face found out why.

19:29.826 --> 19:31.391
The basement of the building

19:31.434 --> 19:35.217
was forged next to a
bunker from the 1940s.

19:35.260 --> 19:38.826
It's still there.So the bunker itself
has probably seen its share

19:38.869 --> 19:40.086
of renovations but still.

19:40.130 --> 19:41.521
Samar bought the place

19:41.565 --> 19:44.260
for the hidden storage.Yeah.

19:44.304 --> 19:46.695
I mean, there's no telling
how many forensic gems

19:46.739 --> 19:48.869
are in that bunker, Gibbs.

19:48.913 --> 19:50.478
And you know how much

19:50.521 --> 19:53.956
I lovesecret rooms.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.130
You and Poppy want to leave
the lab and go to the bunker.

19:57.173 --> 19:59.043
I'll take Tony and Bishop
with me.

20:01.130 --> 20:03.347
[speaking Arabic]

20:03.391 --> 20:06.347
You speak Arabic?
That's amazing.

20:06.391 --> 20:08.826
I learned some key phrases
on the plane.

20:08.869 --> 20:10.608
You think we got time
to check in?Yeah.

20:10.652 --> 20:12.608
Interpol forwarded
a new itinerary.

20:12.652 --> 20:14.782
First meeting's
in an hour.

20:14.826 --> 20:16.782
You will remember
Matthew Rousseau.

20:16.826 --> 20:19.000
McGEE:
The Calling's Director
of Communications.

20:19.043 --> 20:20.478
One of their many leaders.

20:20.521 --> 20:22.695
Is DGSI still
surveilling him?

20:22.739 --> 20:24.260
No.

20:24.304 --> 20:25.260
We got him.

20:25.304 --> 20:27.000
It was a joint operation

20:27.043 --> 20:28.391
with your special forces.

20:28.434 --> 20:31.043
Impromptu.
A beautiful thing, really.

20:31.086 --> 20:32.652
He was captured in Bordeaux.

20:32.695 --> 20:33.913
Currently,
he's being transported

20:33.956 --> 20:35.173
to a U.S. aircraft carrier

20:35.217 --> 20:37.260
in the Bay of Biscay.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.695
He's wanted in the U.S.
for a... attempted bombing

20:39.739 --> 20:43.260
of a post office
in San Francisco in 2005.

20:43.304 --> 20:45.521
Which is why he's being
transported back to the States.

20:45.565 --> 20:47.434
So he's gonna need an escort.

20:47.478 --> 20:51.391
Yes. And I'll bet that escort
will get first crack

20:51.434 --> 20:53.565
at interrogating him
on the carrier.

20:55.565 --> 20:57.043
What are you doing?

20:57.086 --> 20:58.521
I am volunteering
for the job.

21:01.130 --> 21:02.652
TONY [grunting]:
Almost.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.956
What? You guys, talk louder!
I can't hear you back here!

21:06.000 --> 21:08.695
He said he
almost has it open!

21:08.739 --> 21:11.391
Okay, can you see anything?
What do you see?

21:11.434 --> 21:12.956
What's in there?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.565
What's in the secret room?Abby,

21:14.608 --> 21:15.652
quiet.

21:15.695 --> 21:16.652
Have a little patience.

21:16.695 --> 21:18.652
As soon as we
clear the room,

21:18.695 --> 21:21.478
we will invite you to look.
Bishop, follow me.

21:29.565 --> 21:31.217
Clear!

21:31.260 --> 21:35.000
BISHOP:
Whoa. What happened in here?

21:35.043 --> 21:36.478
They bombed it.

21:36.521 --> 21:38.565
I heard you say "clear,"
so I just ran in

21:38.608 --> 21:42.913
like a...
like a... like a cheetah.

21:42.956 --> 21:45.565
This is shrapnel.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.043
Yeah.
[grunts]

21:47.086 --> 21:49.043
Some kind of test site.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.521
The dimension of these holes

21:53.565 --> 21:57.217
match the specs for an S-mine.

21:57.260 --> 21:58.478
They were planted

21:58.521 --> 22:00.260
and then they
were detonated.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.130
Look at this.

22:03.173 --> 22:06.478
Some kind of document.

22:06.521 --> 22:08.478
This looks like
part of a diagram.

22:08.521 --> 22:10.434
The cylinders
connected by a line.

22:10.478 --> 22:13.652
Samar's handy.
Could be figuring out how to

22:13.695 --> 22:15.130
connect the mines.

22:15.173 --> 22:17.521
That's why he tested
two at once in here.

22:17.565 --> 22:20.478
He's modifying them
into a huge,

22:20.521 --> 22:23.391
mean Bouncing Betty
on steroids.

22:23.434 --> 22:25.043
And he has to have more.

22:25.086 --> 22:27.434
Then where'd he take
the rest of them?

22:27.478 --> 22:30.304
We never met
Luke's biological parents.

22:30.347 --> 22:32.391
It's hard to believe
that two complete strangers

22:32.434 --> 22:34.478
can give you the greatest gift
of your life.

22:34.521 --> 22:37.000
When did Luke start
having trouble?

22:37.043 --> 22:39.043
About two years ago.

22:39.086 --> 22:40.478
It seemed like it
happened overnight.

22:40.521 --> 22:43.391
Kids at school found out
he was Middle Eastern.

22:43.434 --> 22:45.608
They started
to tease him.

22:45.652 --> 22:48.043
We were worried,
so I looked at his laptop.

22:48.086 --> 22:50.913
I saw the sites he was visiting,
the people he was talking to.

22:50.956 --> 22:53.347
They were telling him that...

22:54.608 --> 22:57.565
They were telling him

22:57.608 --> 23:00.260
that all his pain was from
pretending to be American.

23:01.565 --> 23:04.217
WENDY: We took him
to a therapist.

23:04.260 --> 23:07.217
He was getting...
He was getting better.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.217
DAVID:
It's okay, it's okay.

23:09.260 --> 23:11.347
Yesterday, it got bad.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.391
Kids at school spray-painted
some ugly words on his locker.

23:13.434 --> 23:16.086
He came home,
destroyed his room...

23:16.130 --> 23:18.000
We didn't know
until it was too late.

23:18.043 --> 23:19.521
He was already gone.

23:21.391 --> 23:23.347
Who was Luke
before all this?

23:28.434 --> 23:30.000
These are some of his things.

23:31.565 --> 23:33.391
The police already
processed his room.

23:33.434 --> 23:34.913
He destroyed
most of it, but

23:34.956 --> 23:37.869
he missed what was
under the bed.

23:37.913 --> 23:39.478
Agent Gibbs, you're
the first person to ask

23:39.521 --> 23:41.913
what he was like before.

23:44.913 --> 23:46.478
Got to know who I'm looking for.

23:46.521 --> 23:48.347
So you can bring him back to us?

23:50.130 --> 23:52.000
He's our baby boy.

23:57.521 --> 23:59.521
I heard that you like
breakfast for dinner.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.478
I'm not much good
at pancakes.

24:11.478 --> 24:13.478
Is this your house?

24:17.173 --> 24:18.434
Yup.

24:18.478 --> 24:19.478
Why would you bring me here

24:19.521 --> 24:20.652
when I almost shot you?

24:20.695 --> 24:22.173
Did you?

24:22.217 --> 24:25.260
Oh.

24:25.304 --> 24:26.695
Well...

24:26.739 --> 24:28.304
lots of people who
wanted to shoot me

24:28.347 --> 24:29.391
have been in this house.

24:29.434 --> 24:31.434
[laughing]

24:42.304 --> 24:43.521
If you're not gonna eat, Luke,

24:43.565 --> 24:46.130
milk goes back in the fridge.

24:56.130 --> 24:57.391
I'm not gonna ask again.

25:17.608 --> 25:21.217
I had a daughter.

25:21.260 --> 25:24.478
She used to sit right there
at the table where you were.

25:27.173 --> 25:29.478
She took my pocket knife
from me once.

25:31.608 --> 25:34.956
Knife wasn't a toy,
and she knew that.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
She climbed up here.

25:41.391 --> 25:43.173
And she took that
knife and she

25:43.217 --> 25:46.043
carved her initials right into
the back of that cabinet, there.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.913
Then she lost the best
pocket knife that I ever had.

25:48.956 --> 25:50.304
What'd you do?

25:50.347 --> 25:51.347
Oh, I scolded her.

25:51.391 --> 25:53.304
Grounded her.

25:54.913 --> 25:56.695
Then I forgave her.

26:00.608 --> 26:02.347
I'm nothing.

26:04.347 --> 26:05.217
I'm nothing!

26:05.260 --> 26:06.695
Yeah, everyone hates me!

26:06.739 --> 26:08.173
Just kill me!

26:08.217 --> 26:10.304
That's what they want,
that's what I want!

26:22.086 --> 26:25.521
German S-mines were chosen
for their manufacturing.

26:25.565 --> 26:27.521
Desired changes
were easier to implement

26:27.565 --> 26:29.565
than with the later models.

26:29.608 --> 26:32.608
Ms. Sciuto analyzed
the schematics from the bunker.

26:32.652 --> 26:34.391
As many as six mines

26:34.434 --> 26:36.956
will be linked
via encrypted Wi-Fi.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.608
Tripwire's virtual.

26:38.652 --> 26:39.913
A pinpoint laser.

26:41.434 --> 26:43.391
Not your dad's land mine.No.

26:43.434 --> 26:46.043
Well, there was
evidence of two mines

26:46.086 --> 26:47.565
detonated in
Samar's bunker.

26:47.608 --> 26:48.956
By now he could have more.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.043
And the boy?Luke Harris.

26:50.086 --> 26:51.695
He's back
in holding.

26:51.739 --> 26:53.739
Likely knows how
to get in touch with Samar.

26:53.782 --> 26:55.739
Lost cause?No, he's not a lost cause.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.043
It'll take some time
to turn him around.Don't have it.

26:58.086 --> 27:01.130
Remember, DGSI intercepted
multiple communications.

27:01.173 --> 27:03.000
Samar is not the
only Calling member

27:03.043 --> 27:05.173
stockpiling S-mines
on American soil.

27:05.217 --> 27:08.173
We need a line to anyone
and everyone in the game.

27:08.217 --> 27:09.173
We need Bayar.

27:09.217 --> 27:10.391
DIA won't budge.

27:11.956 --> 27:14.347
We did some digging.

27:14.391 --> 27:17.130
Bayar sends groceries to
an apartment every Friday.

27:17.173 --> 27:19.304
His mother lives there
in secret. Go figure--

27:19.347 --> 27:21.347
Agah Bayar has a mother.

27:21.391 --> 27:22.652
He won't want her deported.

27:22.695 --> 27:24.173
We don't need
an aboveboard deal.

27:24.217 --> 27:27.565
Blackmail Bayar to help us,
DIA's none the wiser.

27:27.608 --> 27:29.652
That's the plan?

27:29.695 --> 27:31.826
Yeah. You got
a better one, Leon?

27:34.739 --> 27:36.565
A word of advice:

27:36.608 --> 27:38.217
don't get caught.

27:38.260 --> 27:40.826
Hey, I'm with Luke.
DiNozzo, you're with Bayar.

27:40.869 --> 27:42.173
Finally gonna meet
the pride of Turkey.

27:42.217 --> 27:43.782
Yeah, well he's not gonna
like you. Take Bishop.

27:47.173 --> 27:49.565
These are to die for.

27:49.608 --> 27:51.695
We need to talk.

27:51.739 --> 27:53.782
As much as I adore
making new friends,

27:53.826 --> 27:56.608
I worry about
losing old ones.

27:56.652 --> 27:58.521
Gibbs is tied up.

27:58.565 --> 27:59.869
What do you think?

27:59.913 --> 28:01.043
What do you mean
what does she think?

28:01.086 --> 28:03.043
Gibbs is tied up,
he sent us.

28:03.086 --> 28:04.652
I heard you.

28:04.695 --> 28:06.521
But I didn't
like your answer.

28:06.565 --> 28:09.695
You don't like my answer
or you don't like me?

28:09.739 --> 28:11.782
Neither.

28:11.826 --> 28:14.521
Gibbs really is tied up.

28:15.956 --> 28:18.521
He sends his apologies.You see?

28:18.565 --> 28:20.565
She dips it in sugar,

28:20.608 --> 28:23.000
and all of a sudden,
it tastes so sweet.

28:25.130 --> 28:26.695
Mr. Bayar...

28:26.739 --> 28:29.043
Please, call me Agah.

28:29.086 --> 28:31.086
Agah.

28:31.130 --> 28:33.478
We'd like to discuss
your mother.

28:36.913 --> 28:38.652
Gibbs and I had an agreement.

28:38.695 --> 28:39.608
We know.

28:39.652 --> 28:41.043
We shook on fair terms.

28:41.086 --> 28:42.478
Not gonna happen.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.782
DIA?

28:46.608 --> 28:48.608
The problem is

28:48.652 --> 28:50.565
we still need
your help, Agah.

28:50.608 --> 28:53.086
We need you to reach out
to your contacts

28:53.130 --> 28:55.521
and find out who's
seeking these S-mines.

28:55.565 --> 28:57.652
We need locations
on these people.

28:57.695 --> 29:00.130
Yes, well, I did some research

29:00.173 --> 29:02.478
of my own, dear heart.

29:02.521 --> 29:04.391
And I know that
you're after The Calling,

29:04.434 --> 29:06.086
and The Calling's
after the children.

29:06.130 --> 29:08.043
That's right.

29:11.478 --> 29:13.434
My mother's flawed,

29:13.478 --> 29:15.608
but she's my own.

29:15.652 --> 29:18.782
And if you ever
threaten her again,

29:18.826 --> 29:20.521
my response
won't be civil.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.565
I'll help you.

29:24.608 --> 29:25.913
But your efforts
were wasted.

29:25.956 --> 29:28.695
I would've helped you
without payment,

29:28.739 --> 29:31.043
and without blackmail.

29:31.086 --> 29:33.521
Why?Women and children
first.

29:33.565 --> 29:37.565
It was an absolute
we could always agree upon.

29:37.608 --> 29:39.869
When babies are used
in the wars of men...

29:41.695 --> 29:44.521
...then God help us all.

29:48.521 --> 29:50.130
[door opens]Duck...

29:50.173 --> 29:52.869
you all right?Well, seeing what
once mattered

29:52.913 --> 29:56.260
to Luke Harris makes him
very real, very young.

29:56.304 --> 30:00.086
This is my second profile
of a manipulated boy

30:00.130 --> 30:02.347
in just a short number of days.

30:02.391 --> 30:04.173
Before, it was just
one troubled kid.

30:04.217 --> 30:07.608
And now we see a virus
affecting our youth.

30:07.652 --> 30:09.565
I mean, why

30:09.608 --> 30:12.000
did Luke's frustrations
bring him here,

30:12.043 --> 30:13.565
instead of storming
out of the house

30:13.608 --> 30:15.391
and lighting up
a cigarette?

30:15.434 --> 30:18.434
Every teen
is prone to rebellion.

30:18.478 --> 30:20.000
Yeah.

30:20.043 --> 30:22.043
But then The Calling

30:22.086 --> 30:25.434
twists that vulnerability
into terror.

30:25.478 --> 30:27.608
Duck, I got to reach this kid.

30:27.652 --> 30:29.391
To find Samar.

30:29.434 --> 30:31.304
For himself,
for his parents.

30:31.347 --> 30:33.608
For you.

30:33.652 --> 30:36.913
I think I've found
something that might help.

30:36.956 --> 30:40.826
This grotesque reading
is from The Calling forum

30:40.869 --> 30:43.956
that Abby found
on the Deep Web.

30:44.000 --> 30:47.173
It's a virtual handbook
from Samar to his recruits.

30:47.217 --> 30:51.130
It tells them that in order
to demonstrate their loyalty,

30:51.173 --> 30:53.739
they must give up
their old lives.

30:53.782 --> 30:55.478
Luke trashed his room
before he left.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.521
But according to Samar,
the most important act

30:58.565 --> 31:00.478
for a recruit is
to condemn those

31:00.521 --> 31:03.956
who are not aligned with
The Calling's ideology.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.347
"Especially those
closest to you."

31:06.391 --> 31:07.347
His parents.

31:07.391 --> 31:09.043
Yeah. Which brings me

31:09.086 --> 31:11.434
to this notebook.

31:11.478 --> 31:13.608
Now, this is Luke's handwriting.

31:15.391 --> 31:16.826
A letter?

31:16.869 --> 31:18.478
To his adoptive
parents.

31:18.521 --> 31:19.869
The language
is brutal.

31:19.913 --> 31:22.608
Yeah, but the letter
is unfinished.

31:22.652 --> 31:24.173
He was trying to disown 'em.

31:24.217 --> 31:26.521
He couldn't bring
himself to finish it.

31:26.565 --> 31:29.043
Jethro, the darkness here

31:29.086 --> 31:31.043
is undeniable.

31:31.086 --> 31:33.608
But what we're
dealing with is a...

31:33.652 --> 31:35.608
well, it's a child.

31:35.652 --> 31:37.565
Who, beneath it all,

31:37.608 --> 31:40.739
I swear, he-he loves
his parents very much.

31:52.739 --> 31:54.086
Did you write that?

31:56.000 --> 31:57.869
Did you write that?!Yes.

31:57.913 --> 31:59.478
You want to finish it
before I show it to 'em?

31:59.521 --> 32:01.782
To who?Your parents.

32:01.826 --> 32:03.913
What's wrong?

32:03.956 --> 32:06.652
It's for them, isn't it?

32:06.695 --> 32:08.826
You did everything
you were supposed to.

32:08.869 --> 32:11.000
Disown everyone who
isn't The Calling.

32:11.043 --> 32:13.391
That's what Samar
wants, right?Please don't

32:13.434 --> 32:15.173
show it to them.Oh, no, that's
already been decided.

32:15.217 --> 32:18.173
Don't, all right? Don't!Hey!

32:18.217 --> 32:20.260
You said you
wanted to die.

32:20.304 --> 32:23.304
What would your parents
think if they heard that?

32:23.347 --> 32:26.000
You broke their hearts.

32:28.608 --> 32:31.695
The kids at school hate me.

32:31.739 --> 32:34.478
They kept telling me
to go back to Iraq.

32:37.565 --> 32:40.173
I don't know
what to do anymore.

32:40.217 --> 32:43.391
You talk to me.

32:43.434 --> 32:45.260
Where is Samar?

32:45.304 --> 32:49.043
If I tell you what I know...

32:49.086 --> 32:51.695
will you take me
to see my parents?

32:51.739 --> 32:53.217
Yes.

32:53.260 --> 32:56.434
I... [sighs]

32:56.478 --> 32:58.521
I didn't want to hurt them.

32:58.565 --> 33:00.391
I...

33:00.434 --> 33:02.478
I don't want to hurt them.

33:02.521 --> 33:06.217
What were you doing
in the building?

33:06.260 --> 33:08.565
Luke was in the building because
Samar ordered him to stay there.

33:08.608 --> 33:11.043
Gibbs got Luke to talk?Okay, so, Luke went to
the building to meet up

33:11.086 --> 33:12.695
with his so-called brothers,

33:12.739 --> 33:14.434
but Samar got everyone out
before their introductions.

33:14.478 --> 33:16.043
He was afraid that
Bradley Simek's computer

33:16.086 --> 33:17.869
would lead the police
back to the building.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.478
Then why tell Luke
to stay behind?Because Samar knew

33:20.521 --> 33:23.130
that the police would
hesitate to shoot a kid.It was a trap.

33:23.173 --> 33:24.652
When we found him,

33:24.695 --> 33:26.304
Luke was supposed
to kill whoever he could?

33:26.347 --> 33:28.173
Yeah, but let's focus on
the positive here, though.

33:28.217 --> 33:31.347
Like the URL
for Samar's latest chat room.

33:31.391 --> 33:33.000
Luke gave it to Gibbs.

33:33.043 --> 33:35.478
Look: "Have you heard
how Little L is feeling?"

33:35.521 --> 33:37.217
They've got to be talking
about Luke.

33:37.260 --> 33:38.304
Yeah, SSÃ³_BUILDER-48.

33:38.347 --> 33:39.956
That's Samar talking.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.434
"I think Little L has the flu.

33:42.478 --> 33:44.217
He didn't go to work, or we
would have heard about it."

33:44.260 --> 33:45.695
"Didn't go to work."

33:45.739 --> 33:47.478
Didn't do his job--
he didn't kill anyone.

33:47.521 --> 33:49.913
[sighs]

33:49.956 --> 33:52.043
BISHOP: "He needs to
learn what happens

33:52.086 --> 33:54.304
when you give in
to the sickness."

33:54.347 --> 33:56.043
They think Luke's a traitor.

33:56.086 --> 33:58.608
He's in danger.
Where is he?

33:58.652 --> 34:00.000
Gibbs took him
to his parents' house.

34:01.695 --> 34:02.956
The door's open.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.652
Hey. Hey!

34:04.695 --> 34:07.565
Stay here.

34:34.521 --> 34:36.782
LUKE:
Mom!

34:36.826 --> 34:39.130
Mom! Mom!

34:39.173 --> 34:42.130
[crying]:
Mom! Mom! Dad!

34:42.173 --> 34:43.521
Dad! Dad!

34:43.565 --> 34:45.434
Dad!GIBBS:
Hey, hey, hey.

34:45.478 --> 34:48.304
[gasping, screaming]:
Mom! No! No!

34:50.695 --> 34:53.478
I know nothing
about any S-mines.

34:53.521 --> 34:55.913
Well, DGSI thought that
you were a Calling leader.

34:55.956 --> 34:59.130
Guess the press is gonna have a
field day when they find out

34:59.173 --> 35:01.608
that you're only a lackey.

35:03.217 --> 35:06.043
You ask about
the United States.

35:06.086 --> 35:08.260
You ask the wrong questions.

35:08.304 --> 35:10.260
Then why don't you
set me straight?

35:10.304 --> 35:12.521
When you plan
a big party,

35:12.565 --> 35:15.695
there are many details
discussed over many lines.

35:15.739 --> 35:18.608
It is impossible
to keep them secret.

35:20.913 --> 35:24.217
You left such a party
to be with me today, no?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.869
I'm sorry you're missing
our contribution to the fun.

35:28.913 --> 35:30.217
Guard!

35:30.260 --> 35:32.130
Open up! I need a phone!

35:32.173 --> 35:34.478
NED:
McGee.

35:34.521 --> 35:36.608
Hey, we're on a break.
I was just about to...McGEE: Dorneget, listen to me.

35:36.652 --> 35:39.043
There's a threat to the hotel.
They know you're there.

35:39.086 --> 35:41.173
You need to get everyone out
of there. Evacuate now!

35:41.217 --> 35:43.173
Everybody out! Go! Go!

35:43.217 --> 35:45.043
What is happening?Threat to the hotel. Go.

35:45.086 --> 35:47.130
Go! Go!
[shouting in Arabic]

35:47.173 --> 35:49.478
[speaking Arabic]
Go!

35:49.521 --> 35:52.217
[speaking Arabic]

35:54.000 --> 35:55.826
[speaking Arabic]

35:55.869 --> 35:58.913
[speaks Arabic]

35:58.956 --> 36:02.260
[speaking Arabic]

36:18.608 --> 36:20.217
No! No! No! No! No!

36:45.347 --> 36:47.521
ZNN REPORTER:
Once again, we bring to you
the latest on the explosion

36:47.565 --> 36:49.913
that occurred
less than 40 minutes ago

36:49.956 --> 36:51.608
at the Hotel Al Maha
in downtown Cairo...

36:51.652 --> 36:53.956
All right, I need you
to call me back

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
as soon as you know his status.
Thank you.

36:56.043 --> 36:57.434
Anything?

36:57.478 --> 36:59.043
I'm on hold again.GIBBS:
Stay with him.

36:59.086 --> 37:01.173
He needs somebody with him.

37:01.217 --> 37:03.391
Dorneget?Last we heard, he was
rushed to the hospital.

37:03.434 --> 37:04.521
We're waiting on an update.

37:04.565 --> 37:06.608
McGee?He's circling back to Cairo.

37:06.652 --> 37:09.130
The agent afloat's escorting
Rousseau back here.

37:09.173 --> 37:10.434
Boss, Rousseau
had prior knowledge

37:10.478 --> 37:12.434
of the explosion.
The intel suggests

37:12.478 --> 37:15.347
multiple mines with a laser
tripwire. This was The Calling.

37:15.391 --> 37:16.565
It's just a matter of
time before they take credit.

37:16.608 --> 37:18.608
Where are we?
With what?

37:18.652 --> 37:21.956
With anything, DiNozzo!
I want the head of this thing!

37:22.000 --> 37:23.565
Who is he?
What is his play?

37:23.608 --> 37:26.391
Why is he hitting Cairo
when our intel says here?

37:26.434 --> 37:28.782
Gibbs.
What?

37:28.826 --> 37:30.086
I just got confirmation.

37:31.826 --> 37:33.043
Dorneget didn't make it.

37:43.217 --> 37:45.086
Where are we with Bayar?

37:46.869 --> 37:49.043
He has something for us,
wants to set a meet.

37:49.086 --> 37:50.826
Then do it!

37:58.086 --> 37:59.478
All right, what do you have?

37:59.521 --> 38:02.565
I'll wait for Agent Bishop.

38:02.608 --> 38:04.173
[sighs]

38:04.217 --> 38:05.478
She's on the phone.

38:05.521 --> 38:07.478
Yes, I can see that.

38:07.521 --> 38:09.260
Look, I haven't had a great day.

38:09.304 --> 38:10.956
I know you don't like me.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.478
Can we move on?

38:12.521 --> 38:14.130
Agent DiNozzo,

38:14.173 --> 38:15.652
don't be so sensitive.

38:15.695 --> 38:18.347
Two shining stallions
in one tiny area.

38:18.391 --> 38:20.521
When we're together,

38:20.565 --> 38:22.391
the world's stables
are knocked off-balance.

38:24.478 --> 38:26.347
[sighs]

38:26.391 --> 38:28.521
Sorry about that.

38:28.565 --> 38:31.521
I have identified three
people seeking S-mines.

38:31.565 --> 38:33.000
The particulars
are inside.

38:33.043 --> 38:34.565
Cairo is just
the beginning.

38:34.608 --> 38:37.304
The attack tonight
was just a test run.Test run for what?

38:37.347 --> 38:39.043
The Calling are gathering
S-mines

38:39.086 --> 38:41.173
in all major cities
around the world.

38:41.217 --> 38:44.391
They are planning a coordinated,
international attack.

38:44.434 --> 38:47.086
If they succeed,

38:47.130 --> 38:48.434
the results will
be catastrophic.

38:48.478 --> 38:50.043
When?

38:50.086 --> 38:52.043
I have no idea.

38:52.086 --> 38:53.739
BISHOP: We need you to
stay on this, Agah.

38:53.782 --> 38:55.260
We need you to keep digging.

38:55.304 --> 38:57.434
I have my limits.

38:57.478 --> 38:59.521
Pro bono only feels good
for so long.

38:59.565 --> 39:02.043
Down!

39:02.086 --> 39:03.739
[grunting]

39:11.652 --> 39:12.695
[groaning]

39:12.739 --> 39:14.608
He needs an ambulance.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.347
BISHOP:
Okay. It's okay.

39:19.304 --> 39:21.521
Details are trickling in.

39:21.565 --> 39:23.347
Bayar's in surgery.

39:23.391 --> 39:25.782
Doctors are optimistic.

39:30.130 --> 39:32.391
As far as Cairo,

39:32.434 --> 39:36.043
I did speak to SecNav. She...

39:43.695 --> 39:46.043
Gibbs?

39:46.086 --> 39:47.391
I need you with me.

39:47.434 --> 39:48.695
I'm here.

39:50.869 --> 39:52.739
Reports to SecNav are confirmed.

39:52.782 --> 39:55.391
Agent Dorneget led
a last-minute evacuation.

39:55.434 --> 39:58.434
He saved a lot of lives.

39:58.478 --> 40:00.391
He would have wanted you
to know that.

40:01.347 --> 40:03.652
His family?

40:03.695 --> 40:06.304
It's just his mother.

40:06.347 --> 40:07.565
She's been notified.

40:07.608 --> 40:09.478
She's been out of the country.

40:09.521 --> 40:13.000
Travel is complicated.
Right.

40:13.043 --> 40:15.434
There anything
we can do for her?

40:15.478 --> 40:17.043
Yeah, actually, there is.

40:17.086 --> 40:18.478
She won't be able to make it

40:18.521 --> 40:20.478
before the plane arrives
from Cairo.

40:20.521 --> 40:22.434
Well, we'll be there for him.

40:32.217 --> 40:34.521
[sighs]

40:39.956 --> 40:42.347
COMMANDER:
Funeral detail, attention!

40:43.304 --> 40:46.478
Forward... march!

40:46.521 --> 40:50.086
DUCKY:
"We cannot always build the
future for our youth..."

40:52.086 --> 40:55.304
"...but we can build our youth
for the future."

40:55.347 --> 40:58.217
FDR's words were
never more urgent.

41:27.086 --> 41:29.260
Gibbs, you all right?

41:41.869 --> 41:43.782
GUARD COMMANDER:
Shoulder arms!

41:48.043 --> 41:50.347
GUARD COMMANDER:
Forward march.

42:27.086 --> 42:30.391
We weren't expecting you
until tomorrow.

42:30.434 --> 42:32.521
We would have waited.
I know.

42:32.565 --> 42:35.173
Gibbs?

42:37.130 --> 42:39.739
CIA Officer
Joanna Teague,

42:39.782 --> 42:41.695
Agent Dorneget's mother.

42:41.739 --> 42:44.043
GIBBS:
Officer Teague,

42:44.086 --> 42:46.521
we're sorry for your loss.

42:46.565 --> 42:50.478
Ned would have appreciated
the pomp and circumstance.

42:50.521 --> 42:53.000
But my son is dead,

42:53.043 --> 42:55.000
and his killers
are still out there.

42:55.043 --> 42:57.217
I'd say
we've got some work to do.
