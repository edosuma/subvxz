00:31.500 --> 00:33.400
- Horace.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.000
- Horace.
- Wh- what the hell?

00:37.100 --> 00:38.300
- Hey.
- Horace, good morning.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.500
- Marsha, what are you doing here?

00:41.600 --> 00:44.200
- I want to talk to you.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.700
- Marsha, you can't just
come into my bedroom.

00:47.735 --> 00:49.700
- Yes, I can.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.500
This used to be my bed,
you know.

00:52.535 --> 00:54.600
Me and your father's.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.900
I guess it was your mother's
bedroom, too, huh?

01:01.400 --> 01:04.400
You sleep in your panties
just like your dad.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.100
- Marsha, this is really weird.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.900
Can you please go out
into the living room and I'll...

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
(Marsha laughing)

01:16.400 --> 01:18.400
- How old are you now?

01:18.500 --> 01:20.400
- 49.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.500
- Oh.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.600
- How old are you?

01:29.500 --> 01:32.600
Marsha, I need-
I need to get dressed, so...

01:33.600 --> 01:35.600
- Go ahead.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.900
(Marsha laughing)

01:48.100 --> 01:50.500
(door shuts)

01:57.500 --> 02:00.200
- Morning.
- Hey.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.800
- Brought your coffee up.

02:02.900 --> 02:04.800
- Thank you.

02:09.699 --> 02:12.900
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.200
Trying to get up earlier.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.600
I started thinking that...

02:19.700 --> 02:23.500
you know, I'm getting older,
not gonna live forever.

02:23.600 --> 02:28.000
In fact, I'm getting, you know,
deep into the second half here.

02:28.100 --> 02:31.300
And I was thinking that,
you know, how, like,

02:31.400 --> 02:34.100
in the first part of my life,
I slept a lot.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.500
I mean, when I was in the hospital,
that's all I did.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.100
So I was thinking that, uh,

02:39.200 --> 02:42.900
you know,
life experienced is life lived.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.400
And so if I get up earlier,
right, from now on,

02:46.500 --> 02:49.000
and I sleep less,
then I'm making, you know,

02:49.100 --> 02:52.800
the second half of my life
longer than the first.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.500
- Yeah, that makes sense.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.000
I'm kind of doing the opposite.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.000
I'm trying to sleep more
and wrap it up.

03:01.100 --> 03:05.600
- You see, except, I don't know
when I'm gonna die, right?

03:05.700 --> 03:07.400
So if I get hit by a truck today,

03:07.500 --> 03:11.500
then the halfway point
was like 26 years ago.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.600
- Pete, you're not gonna
get hit by a truck.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.300
- How do you know?
- 'Cause you don't leave this building.

03:17.300 --> 03:20.100
If a truck was gonna hit you,
it'd have to come in the front door.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.900
- Well, that's true.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.300
Still, there's plenty of ways
for a guy to die.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.400
- Sure.

03:29.500 --> 03:33.300
- And then after that, that's it,
once that happens, right?

03:33.400 --> 03:35.300
I mean, I don't think
there's anything after.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.965
Do you?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.400
- Hey, man, I just-
I just woke up.

03:42.900 --> 03:46.100
- Hey, the beer guy is coming today.
- Fuck.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.900
- Well, you gotta talk to him
about prices.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.200
- Yeah, I know.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.600
- He drove Budweiser up
five bucks a barrel.

03:51.700 --> 03:54.100
- Yeah, no, I got it, I got it.
- Just tell him maybe-

03:54.200 --> 03:57.700
- All right, you know, Pete,
get the fuck off my back, please.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.000
- Okay, okay, Grumpy Gus.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.700
- Jesus.
- Sorry.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.000
- Whatever.
- I'm sorry.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.800
- You know, there's a bad pattern here
where you treat me like shit

04:09.835 --> 04:12.800
and then you say you're sorry,
rinse, lather, repeat.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.700
I'm kind of sick of it.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.700
- Okay. Okay.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.700
- So what do you think happens
after you die?

04:23.800 --> 04:26.200
- I don't know.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.700
If you're good,
you go to some place

04:28.800 --> 04:30.900
where you get to drink lemonade
out of a giant pussy.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.600
- Hey, what-
Why do you say things like that?

04:35.700 --> 04:38.400
Jeez Louise.

04:38.500 --> 04:41.300
- You asked me what happens
after you die.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.400
That's if you're good.

04:44.435 --> 04:46.400
- Wow.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.000
Well, I dated this girl,

04:51.100 --> 04:54.900
it was back in junior year,
I mean, before all the shit hit the fan.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.400
I don't know if you met her-
Vanessa.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.565
- Black girl.
- Yeah.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.100
- Yeah.
- She was super cool.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.800
Anyway, she said that her daddy
told her that when she dies,

05:05.900 --> 05:08.400
if she's been bad in her life,

05:08.500 --> 05:11.800
after she dies, she's gonna go
to wherever he is,

05:11.900 --> 05:13.900
and he's gonna beat her ass
forever and ever.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.000
- That's...

05:19.400 --> 05:21.300
What- what religion is that?

05:21.400 --> 05:23.400
- I think they were Baptists.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.700
- I wonder if that's where
I'm gonna go.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.300
- Well, you're not gonna go to
the other place with the...

05:33.400 --> 05:34.900
- With the...
- ... lemonade.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
(Horace laughing)

05:46.100 --> 05:48.200
- Wow, look at these poor fucks.

05:48.235 --> 05:51.100
- What?
- The refugees.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.300
- Oh, fuck, that mess.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.300
They'd rather drown
than stay in their own country.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.200
Or they get killed by pirates.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.400
The whole world is going
back in time, you know.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.500
- Yeah.

06:02.600 --> 06:06.000
Well, also, now that Europe
let these people in their country,

06:06.100 --> 06:07.700
it turns out they rape.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.000
A bunch of raping refugees,
apparently.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.900
- Well, it's not like they all rape.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.700
I mean...

06:14.800 --> 06:16.900
I mean, it's wrong that it happens,

06:17.100 --> 06:21.000
but you can't say every one
of those people is raping.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.000
I mean, if everybody was raping,

06:24.100 --> 06:26.300
there'd be no one to be raped.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.600
I want to take some of
those sentences back.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.600
- The weird part
with these refugees is

06:31.700 --> 06:34.400
they're fleeing to Germany,
you know?

06:34.500 --> 06:38.000
And then they get there and they get
put in a camp, like, a German camp.

06:38.100 --> 06:41.300
- Yeah, yeah, that's like before.
- Yeah, what if, uh,

06:41.400 --> 06:44.500
what if Germany just starts
exterminating them out of, like, habit?

06:44.600 --> 06:46.700
They're like, guys, we're so sorry,
like, we just thought

06:46.800 --> 06:48.600
this is how camps are done.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.400
- You know, don't talk about that.
- Why?

06:51.500 --> 06:53.800
- You don't know-
you don't really know what happened.

06:53.835 --> 06:56.000
You weren't there.
I know a guy who was there.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.265
- He liberated one of the camps.
- Yeah?

06:58.300 --> 07:00.900
- He's walking into the camp
with his platoon

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
and they see all these people
starving and dying, you know?

07:05.100 --> 07:08.300
And the whole platoon starts crying,

07:08.335 --> 07:10.500
only he can't cry.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.100
He's not crying 'cause he's,
you know, he's stunned.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.500
He can't get a tear out.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.300
And everybody's, you know,
crying their eyes out

07:18.500 --> 07:21.900
and the camp prisoners are all
just looking at these people crying

07:22.000 --> 07:23.400
and he still can't cry.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.500
So he feels, like, self-conscious
and guilty, you know?

07:27.700 --> 07:30.650
So he starts trying to
think about things,

07:30.685 --> 07:33.600
like his mother or his kids,
you know?

07:33.700 --> 07:35.865
Still can't cry.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.700
Finally, he thinks of "Bambi. "

07:38.735 --> 07:40.900
- "Bambi"?

07:41.000 --> 07:45.500
- Yeah, it came out in 1942, you know,
right before he shipped off to war.

07:45.600 --> 07:50.200
So he's thinking about how Bambi's
mother was shot, you know?

07:50.300 --> 07:53.300
Cries like a baby.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.400
- I did the opposite.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.500
- How so?

07:57.600 --> 08:01.500
- I was watching "Bambi" with this girl
I was seeing, she was a ballerina.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.200
And when Bambi's mother got shot,

08:04.300 --> 08:06.900
she started crying, the ballerina.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.300
And I wanted to cry with her,

08:09.400 --> 08:11.300
you know,
to show her I had feelings,

08:11.400 --> 08:13.600
but- but I didn't care.

08:15.300 --> 08:19.100
- Wait, so what, you used the Holocaust
so that you could cry about Bambi?

08:19.200 --> 08:21.500
- It's sad.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.600
Isn't it sad?

08:23.700 --> 08:25.400
- Which one,
"Bambi" or the Holocaust?

08:25.500 --> 08:29.700
- It's sad that it's so hard to show
your feelings when you really want to.

08:33.100 --> 08:36.500
- Hey, Pete.
- Marsha, how you doing?

08:36.600 --> 08:40.000
- Can we get a couple of whiskeys?

08:40.100 --> 08:42.700
- Yeah, whiskey's good.
- Couple of whiskeys, please.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.600
- You got it.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.800
- Pete, this is Dennis.

08:46.900 --> 08:49.900
- Dennis.
- Pete, how you doing?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.600
- He owns the tire store
over on Atlantic.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.400
- That right?
- Yeah, unless he's lying to me.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.265
- I got four tire stores in Brooklyn.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.500
I got six tire stores
across Long Island.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.100
- Yeah?
- You must be tired.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.100
- Is that your place
on Atlantic and 17th?

09:05.200 --> 09:07.500
- Oh, that place us bogus, bullshit.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.700
They do retreads, and they'll
rape you with their prices.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.800
I'm over by Flatbush and Atlantic,
by the Jewish bakers?

09:14.900 --> 09:17.600
- The Kosher guy?
- Are your tires Kosher?

09:17.700 --> 09:20.000
- What?
This fucking guy.

09:20.100 --> 09:23.000
- Dennis, Leon.
- Nice to meet you, Leon.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.800
- Oh.
- He don't shake.

09:25.900 --> 09:29.600
- Anyway, that's me over
by the Jewish bakers.

09:29.635 --> 09:31.867
Come over and see me
if you need tires.

09:31.902 --> 09:34.100
- I don't need tires.
I don't have a car.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.200
- Last car I had was a Plymouth.
- Fucking Plymouth?

09:37.300 --> 09:40.400
- Nah, forget it, this is on the house.
- Marsha: Thanks, Pete.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.500
- Mind if I tell you again?

09:44.600 --> 09:46.400
You look beautiful.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.600
- I don't mind, I like it.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.100
- Well, you are.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.000
I never seen a woman look like you.

09:52.100 --> 09:54.600
- I have.
There's a bunch of me.

09:54.700 --> 09:57.500
- Nah, you're exceptional.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.900
- Thank you, Dennis.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.600
You want another one of these?

10:03.700 --> 10:05.700
- Yeah, yeah, okay.
- Yeah.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.700
Can we get a couple more, Pete,
over there?

10:31.500 --> 10:33.100
- Hi, Pete.

10:37.100 --> 10:39.100
Fucking asshole.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.700
- Horace.
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:02.800 --> 11:03.800
Hi.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.900
- You worried I'm gonna
see your nipples?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.100
- No, it's fine.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.600
- Horace, what is wrong with you?
- I'll go put a shirt on and-

11:10.700 --> 11:12.700
- Yeah, good idea.
- Okay.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.600
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.900
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm all right.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.100
I have breast cancer.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.065
- What?

11:38.100 --> 11:40.300
- It's all right, you know,
Mom had it and beat it

11:40.400 --> 11:42.100
and now it's my turn, you know.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.200
It's fucking stupid.
It's my fault.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.200
- How is it your fault?

11:46.300 --> 11:48.065
- I should have had 'em out
when Mom had it.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.100
I like my tits so I held on,
it's just fucking arrogant.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.600
Anyway, you know, I'll beat it.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.900
- Your kids know yet?
- I'm not telling them.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.400
- You're not telling your kids...
- I'm not.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.600
- ... that you have cancer?
You're not gonna tell 'em?

12:00.700 --> 12:01.800
- No.
- Why?

12:01.900 --> 12:04.600
- Because they're little narcissists
and they're gonna make it about them,

12:04.700 --> 12:07.200
then I'm gonna have to manage
their feelings about it

12:07.300 --> 12:10.600
instead of my own when I'm the one
who needs support, so...

12:10.700 --> 12:13.000
- Where are you gonna go for support?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.600
- You, dummy.
Here I am.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.565
- Oh, hey, come here.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.700
- No, no-
I'm okay, I'm okay, I just-

12:20.800 --> 12:23.200
I'm- You know.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.500
- Okay, I mean...

12:27.700 --> 12:30.000
What can I... what can I-

12:30.200 --> 12:31.900
- Tell me what I can do.
- You're doing it.

12:31.935 --> 12:34.700
- You're listening, okay?
- Okay.

12:34.800 --> 12:38.700
- (sighs) Look, Horace,
you have a real capacity

12:38.735 --> 12:40.300
for listening to people
and I depend on it.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.365
I always have.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.600
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, it's true.

12:44.700 --> 12:48.400
And I guess this is a good time to tell
you that it really means a lot to me

12:48.500 --> 12:52.200
that you have always been there
and you've been an ear for me.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.400
- Sylvia...
- Hello?

12:58.200 --> 13:01.300
- Do you remember when Mom
first moved out of here

13:01.400 --> 13:03.700
and, um, the three of us
were living in that-

13:03.800 --> 13:06.800
- the tiny apartment on 72nd Street?
- Yeah, not much, but I do.

13:06.900 --> 13:09.400
- Yeah, I remember.
- Yeah, and she was working

13:09.435 --> 13:11.900
those crazy hours and we would
just be home alone,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.900
we didn't have a TV,
and, uh, you know,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.165
- we would just talk, you know.
- Yeah.

13:18.200 --> 13:23.000
- You were the first person I opened up
to and talked to, like, in my life.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.500
And, uh, those were tough times

13:25.600 --> 13:28.500
and I built a dependence on you.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.800
- I... I had no idea.
- Yeah.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.800
And, uh, you've always
been there, Horace,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.965
you know, just to listen and to-

13:38.000 --> 13:40.900
Just be a witness
and be a pair of ears.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.200
- Wow, I don't know...

13:45.300 --> 13:48.000
I don't know what to say,
you know...

13:48.100 --> 13:51.500
- And that's why it is so hard
to be in conflict with you.

13:51.535 --> 13:53.000
It's really painful.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.400
It's like being in conflict
with a part of myself.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.500
- Are- are we in conflict?

13:58.600 --> 14:00.300
- Of course we are.

14:00.335 --> 14:02.100
- About what?

14:02.200 --> 14:04.800
- About the bar,
about this place.

14:04.835 --> 14:07.300
- Oh, fuck, Sylvia.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.100
Who gives a shit about that?

14:09.200 --> 14:10.700
- We gotta get rid of
this place, Horace.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.600
- Sylvia, I know- I don't-

14:12.700 --> 14:15.400
I'm not upset that you want to
get rid of this bar.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.900
I don't care-
I mean, I get it.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.200
I can't go along with you,
but I do-

14:19.300 --> 14:22.200
That's got nothing to do with...
with you and me.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.000
When do you...
when do you start treatment?

14:26.100 --> 14:27.900
- You know, the only reason
you go along with this shit

14:28.000 --> 14:29.765
is 'cause you can't stand up
to your uncle.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.600
And you're worried that
he's gonna end up on the street.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.500
But Ma got out,
she got us out.

14:35.600 --> 14:39.500
And it kills me to see that
you're back here, back in it.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.400
- Why are we talking
about this right now?

14:41.500 --> 14:43.050
- Do you know
what this building is worth?

14:43.085 --> 14:44.600
Even just to knock it down,
the air rights.

14:44.700 --> 14:47.100
- Wha- Air-
What the fuck is that?

14:47.200 --> 14:48.600
- Air rights, what is that?
- Horace, Horace, listen.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.200
Brooklyn is growing, right?

14:50.300 --> 14:52.600
More and more people are coming here
and there's no room to build.

14:52.700 --> 14:55.200
So people are buying and knocking
down and building up.

14:55.300 --> 14:58.700
The air above this building
is worth millions.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.200
- You want to sell the air.
- Yes.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.900
- Sylvia... do I have to say it?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.600
This is Horace & Pete's.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.300
- And I'm Horace...
- No, fuck!

15:09.400 --> 15:11.300
- It's been here for 100 years,
you don't just-

15:11.400 --> 15:13.300
- It doesn't make any money!
- Well, who cares?

15:13.400 --> 15:16.900
Does everything- does every business
have to make a profit?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.400
Does that have to be
the point of everything?

15:19.435 --> 15:21.065
Can't any place just be a place?

15:21.100 --> 15:23.000
People come here
and it's just a place...

15:23.100 --> 15:26.000
- This place- this place
is a cancer on our family.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.600
- Wow, you really throw
that word around, don't you?

15:28.700 --> 15:29.900
- No, hey, Horace, you know...

15:30.000 --> 15:33.600
- You know, you come in here, Sylvia,
and you tell me that you have cancer.

15:33.635 --> 15:36.900
You stood there and you told me
that you have cancer.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.800
- You just told me that.
- Yes.

15:39.835 --> 15:42.500
- And that you want my support.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.700
And now you're talking about
air rights

15:45.800 --> 15:48.665
and that you-
that you want money.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.700
And, uh, I guess
I feel a little bit used.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.665
- Well, yes, Horace.

15:53.700 --> 15:56.900
I came here to say to you
that I have cancer.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.200
And that I need your support and that
I need money because I have cancer.

16:01.300 --> 16:04.700
So, yes, I want to use you.
You are my brother.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.700
Please let me use you
so that I don't die.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.700
Because cancer, Horace,
is fucking expensive.

16:10.735 --> 16:13.200
It's expensive.

16:13.235 --> 16:15.700
- Oh...

16:18.700 --> 16:21.100
- Oh, hey, Sylvie.
- Hi, Pete.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.500
(Sylvia sighs)

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
- How long was I asleep for?

16:28.100 --> 16:30.200
- About an hour.

16:30.300 --> 16:31.800
- Shit.

16:31.900 --> 16:34.000
- Yeah, you're eating into
that second half there, buddy.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.300
(Pete yawns)

16:57.700 --> 16:59.565
- Hey, I gotta...

16:59.600 --> 17:02.100
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- See ya.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.400
- Bye, Sylvie.
- See you, Pete.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.700
- Hey, Sylvie.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.800
- I was just thinking...
- You know, fuck your mother, Pete.

17:10.835 --> 17:12.700
- Fuck your mother.
- Whoa, oh, oh, in other words,

17:12.800 --> 17:14.700
- fuck your grandmother?
- That's right.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.300
Fuck my grandmother.

17:24.099 --> 17:26.300
- Is this all right?

17:26.400 --> 17:28.400
- Um, yeah.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.700
I don't usually go to bars.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.100
- Oh? Well, I do.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.000
So...

17:35.100 --> 17:37.700
Yeah, whatever, I do.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.800
- Is this okay, really?
- Yeah, I guess.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.200
- Oh, I'll get us a drink.
What do you want?

17:45.300 --> 17:46.800
- Uh, just water.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.400
- You're gonna drink water?
- Yes.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.300
- Oh, come on, that's not fair.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.200
- I don't really drink a lot of alcohol.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.800
- Okay.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.900
- Hi.
- Yeah, what can I get you?

18:01.000 --> 18:04.800
- I'll have a Jameson's,
and, uh, and a water.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.700
- There you go, hon, it's on me.
- Oh, thank you.

18:10.735 --> 18:12.500
- Here you go.
- No, no, no, it's all right.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.600
- It's on me.
- Oh, well, thanks.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.100
- Here's your water.
- Thanks.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.400
- So do you live in Brooklyn?

18:25.500 --> 18:27.800
- Yeah, in Bushwick.
- Me, too.

18:27.900 --> 18:30.900
I mean, live in Brooklyn.
I just moved here.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.865
Listen, Charles-

18:35.900 --> 18:39.200
- Is that what you like, Charles?
- Yeah, people call me Charles.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.600
- Well, Charles,
you're making me drink alone,

18:43.700 --> 18:46.400
but you're also making me
do all the small talk.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.900
It's kinda rude.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.600
- Sorry.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.800
- It's all right, I forgive you.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.500
(chuckles)

18:58.300 --> 19:01.900
So... why'd you swipe me?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.900
Did you think I was cute?

19:05.100 --> 19:07.800
You like the stuff
I wrote about myself?

19:07.900 --> 19:10.300
Come on, you...

19:11.800 --> 19:15.100
I was the first one that came up
and you don't really give a shit

19:15.200 --> 19:19.000
so you just swiped and now
you just want to go pound it out

19:19.100 --> 19:21.300
and get back to your video games.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.800
You're bumming me out,
Charles.

19:25.835 --> 19:28.000
You're just, like...

19:28.100 --> 19:29.500
you're ruining my life.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.500
Like, could you...

19:32.500 --> 19:35.900
I wish you could
just say one nice thing.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.700
- Well, I believe in honesty.

19:42.100 --> 19:46.600
I don't believe in saying fake things
because that's just fake, so...

19:46.800 --> 19:48.900
Yeah, I just say what I mean.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.500
- Really? Well, you might
want to check that attitude

19:52.600 --> 19:55.000
because that's kind of just mean.

19:55.100 --> 19:57.065
- I'm not mean.

19:57.100 --> 20:00.300
- Do you have any idea at all
how to talk to a girl?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.365
- What?

20:03.400 --> 20:05.300
You're a woman.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.300
You're an adult.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.600
We're equals,

20:09.700 --> 20:13.000
so it should just be
normal and honest.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.800
- Oh... oh, okay.

20:18.900 --> 20:23.100
Ugh, so you're just
gonna have your water

20:23.200 --> 20:25.600
and then you want to just go fuck?

20:25.635 --> 20:27.600
That's it?

20:27.700 --> 20:30.100
You probably have a roommate, huh?

20:30.135 --> 20:31.800
- I have two roommates.

20:31.900 --> 20:34.100
- So that means I have to
take you up to my place.

20:37.700 --> 20:40.800
Well, if this is how
it's gonna be, Charles...

20:41.900 --> 20:44.800
I'm sorry, you're gonna have
to watch me drink for a while.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.000
And you're gonna have to talk to me.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.700
I mean, you don't have to be nice to me
if you're so fucking allergic to that,

20:49.900 --> 20:51.600
but you have to talk to me.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.600
- Okay. What about?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.800
- Well...

20:57.900 --> 21:00.800
Who are you? Where are you from?
What are you doing in Brooklyn?

21:00.900 --> 21:02.900
What are you trying to do
with your life?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.500
- I'm from Western Massachusetts.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.900
I plan on being a stand-up comedian.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.600
- Fuck.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.900
- I'll see you later.
- Where you going?

21:15.000 --> 21:17.900
- I gotta- I'm having lunch with Alice.
- Oh, nice.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.465
You guys doing okay?

21:19.500 --> 21:22.465
- Yeah, just trying to sort of

21:22.500 --> 21:25.000
just do one day then one day
then one day, you know?

21:25.100 --> 21:27.465
Lunch one day,
coffee one day, and just...

21:27.500 --> 21:30.700
just let it feel normal,
you know, just build like normal.

21:31.900 --> 21:34.000
- That's... good.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.500
- Don't forget to bring her
some elephant food.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.500
- What's that?
- I'm just saying,

21:40.600 --> 21:43.600
don't forget to bring your fat daughter
some elephant food.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.100
- We hooked into a marlin,
it must've been 30 pounds.

21:51.300 --> 21:54.900
- Marlin? It's a fish.
- Oh, you bet.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.800
It's a big fucking fish.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.400
Pardon my French.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.100
- Big fucking fish,
that's fucking fine with me.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.300
- Hey, hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, easy there.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.800
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.

22:07.835 --> 22:10.600
- You're fine.
- Sure.

22:10.700 --> 22:14.100
- Do you know that you got a smile...

22:15.100 --> 22:16.800
like...

22:16.900 --> 22:19.100
I've never seen one like it.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.100
- Yeah?

22:22.300 --> 22:25.500
You need to get out of the tire store
more often, Dennis.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.600
- Okay, do you remember
after my junior year at Hunter

22:31.700 --> 22:34.700
- when I went to the Middle East?
- Yes, that was terrifying.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.600
- No, it wasn't.
- For me, it was.

22:36.700 --> 22:38.600
- Oh, well.
- Well, you don't know.

22:38.700 --> 22:41.500
You don't, I hope you-
I hope you never know how that feels,

22:41.600 --> 22:44.600
having your own kid
at some wild place.

22:44.700 --> 22:48.100
- Yeah, but how do you think that,
like, imagine how parents feel

22:48.200 --> 22:50.200
who live in a place
like that all the time?

22:50.300 --> 22:51.400
- I don't care, I don't have to.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.700
I don't- That was
the worst time in my life.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.300
- Really?
- Yes.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.400
You don't-
You weren't calling us.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.900
There was people on YouTube
cutting off people's heads

22:59.935 --> 23:01.600
- and you're not getting in touch.
- Oh, God.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.700
- We didn't know-
It's not fucking funny.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.700
It really wasn't.

23:05.800 --> 23:09.000
You know, one night,
I decided you were dead.

23:09.100 --> 23:11.100
- Jesus, Dad.
- I'm serious.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.700
You weren't calling me and I'm, like,
praying it's 'cause you hate me.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.200
I'm like, "She hates me,
she's not calling. "

23:16.300 --> 23:18.700
So I call your mom,
you're not calling her either.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.200
And then we start- we get in a fight,
me and your mom, sorry.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.600
And then I'm laying
awake at night and I'm-

23:25.700 --> 23:28.700
You know when you hear about a parent
who, like, their kid dies somewhere else

23:28.735 --> 23:30.600
and they just know it right away,
so that's what happened.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.400
I'm laying awake in bed
and I get this cold chill over me

23:33.500 --> 23:35.400
and I just knew you were dead.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.500
- Except I wasn't.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.800
- Yeah, I was wrong.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.000
I'm not a good dad, see?

23:47.300 --> 23:52.000
- Well, I had a good time there, so...

23:53.600 --> 23:55.600
- Good.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.200
Hey, uh, if I tell you something,
can you keep it to yourself?

24:00.300 --> 24:02.700
- Yeah, from who?

24:02.800 --> 24:05.700
- Particularly your cousin Brenda,
who I know you're close to.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.500
- Okay, sure.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.800
- So your Aunt Sylvia, um...

24:13.000 --> 24:16.500
- she has breast cancer.
- Yeah, I know that.

24:17.900 --> 24:21.465
- You do?
- Yeah, I mean, Brenda told me.

24:21.500 --> 24:25.200
And she's going to the doctor with her
and she made her check herself.

24:25.300 --> 24:28.700
She's- she's taking care of her,
so why would I have to keep it from her?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.800
You know, she's gonna be fine, Dad.

24:31.900 --> 24:34.700
I know that cancer scares the shit
out of people your age,

24:34.800 --> 24:37.300
- but she is actually gonna be fine.
- Yeah, I know.

24:37.335 --> 24:40.200
- That used to be the "C" word.
- Okay.

24:40.300 --> 24:43.400
- Well, I gotta go to work, so...
- Okay.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.700
- Yeah.
- But- Thank you for lunch.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.900
- This was nice.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.200
You know, I think that this is the most
time we've ever spent together since-

24:52.300 --> 24:55.400
- Yeah, at least the last couple weeks.
- Yeah, this has been- Yeah.

24:55.500 --> 24:59.100
Well, I'm glad that it's been positive,
for you, I mean, you know?

24:59.300 --> 25:01.550
- Yeah, yeah, well-
- I'm glad.

25:01.585 --> 25:03.800
- It is, it's positive for me

25:03.900 --> 25:08.000
to spend time with my dad,
you know, so...

25:08.100 --> 25:09.600
- Good.
- Yeah.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.900
Well, oh, um, how's Rachel?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.100
- Um...

25:15.200 --> 25:17.700
- What?

25:17.800 --> 25:20.200
- Rachel moved out.
- Oh.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.700
I'm- I'm sorry.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.400
- Yeah, no, I asked her...

25:23.500 --> 25:25.800
- Wait, you did?
- I asked her to move out.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.400
- Wait, so you kicked her out?

25:29.435 --> 25:30.900
- Well...

25:31.000 --> 25:32.600
- Dad, why?

25:32.700 --> 25:34.400
Why? She was nice to you.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.500
She was actually good for you.

25:37.900 --> 25:40.900
- Well, I...
- Oh, my God.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.400
- I guess I thought that you-
If you wanted-

25:43.435 --> 25:44.900
- Dad.
- I just wanted-

25:45.000 --> 25:47.100
- Dad, what the fuck?
- What?

25:47.200 --> 25:50.100
- Because you kicked out
your good girlfriend

25:50.200 --> 25:51.800
and now you're putting that on me.

25:51.900 --> 25:54.000
- No, I didn't say that.
- Yeah, yeah.

25:54.100 --> 25:57.000
- I thought- Look, I thought-
- Oh, my God, what is wrong with you?

25:57.100 --> 25:58.400
- I thought of it as an upgrade, okay?
I did.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.800
I thought that you would have a place.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.200
What's so wrong with that?
I wanted to make it- you comfortable.

26:04.300 --> 26:07.400
- Oh, my God.
- Look, I liked Rachel.

26:07.500 --> 26:10.800
- Yeah, and she loved you
and she was nice to you.

26:10.900 --> 26:13.450
She was- she was,
like, taking care of you.

26:13.485 --> 26:16.000
- Okay, well, I guess
I thought I'd rather

26:16.100 --> 26:19.100
than have her be there for me,
I thought I'd rather be there for you.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.700
- Yeah, but now none of us
are there for any of us.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.000
- Jesus fucking Christ.

26:27.900 --> 26:31.200
Why is this so hard?
Why is it so complicated to you?

26:31.235 --> 26:33.000
This is- To me,
this is not complicated.

26:33.100 --> 26:34.900
I am trying-
I want to be close to you.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.300
I am your father.
I want you in my life.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.200
Why is that not a simple thing to you?

26:39.300 --> 26:41.000
- Okay, but how do you
think that feels,

26:41.100 --> 26:45.200
to have someone going like this,
you know, when I don't want that?

26:45.235 --> 26:47.200
Like, I- I feel awful.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.800
- I'm not going like this,
I'm not going like this.

26:48.900 --> 26:50.300
- Yes, you are.
- I'm going like this.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.700
- No.

26:51.800 --> 26:55.000
I'm trying to be here.
I can't be here.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.100
I'm just trying to get here.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.000
- God.
- Why do you, uh...

27:00.000 --> 27:02.800
- Why do you spend any time with me?
- I don't know.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.600
- It'd be helpful to know why you-

27:05.700 --> 27:09.000
- I don't know.
- I don't think you like being with me.

27:09.100 --> 27:10.800
- Oh, my God.
- I think you have-

27:10.900 --> 27:12.600
- Please.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.600
You know...

27:15.800 --> 27:19.065
My brother is so miserable

27:19.100 --> 27:21.200
and I don't want to be like him,
you know?

27:21.300 --> 27:23.500
And I'm trying...

27:24.600 --> 27:28.400
I'm trying to spend time with you,
and I tried, already,

27:28.500 --> 27:32.400
not speaking to you for three years
and it didn't work, so I'm trying this.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.800
- Didn't work how? What's- what
are you trying to accomplish?

27:34.900 --> 27:36.800
- I'm...

27:36.900 --> 27:40.100
I'm trying to

27:40.200 --> 27:42.800
be able to think about you
without puking.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.400
(Horace exhales sharply)

27:47.500 --> 27:49.600
And this is me trying.

27:54.300 --> 27:57.100
- That's why you- that's why
you're spending time with me now.

27:57.135 --> 27:59.100
That's why.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.900
- I'm...

28:04.000 --> 28:06.800
just sick of being alone.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.600
And...

28:11.700 --> 28:13.800
I'm alone all the time.

28:13.900 --> 28:16.900
All the fucking time
and I always hated it.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.400
I always hated being alone.

28:20.900 --> 28:25.000
And I know that I'm the one
who chose to study law,

28:25.100 --> 28:29.165
but it's just me
and the fucking books

28:29.200 --> 28:33.200
and the fucking law students
who are more boring than the books.

28:33.300 --> 28:35.700
It's the same as being alone.

28:35.800 --> 28:38.200
And I fucking hate it.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.500
It's just- it's miserable.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.100
And even with David,
I was alone.

28:44.200 --> 28:47.500
So... it sucks.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.900
And it just...

28:51.000 --> 28:53.200
like, it hurts, you know?

28:57.300 --> 29:00.400
I think I'm gonna leave right now.

29:00.500 --> 29:03.500
Just so that we can leave
this on a good note.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.100
- That was a good note?
- Yeah.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.300
Yeah, that was good.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.300
You did good.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.400
I'll see you.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.600
♪♪

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
(man humming)

29:48.800 --> 29:50.765
♪ Horace &... ♪♪

29:50.800 --> 29:54.200
- From the time he was a baby,
he was like in a parade,

29:54.300 --> 29:55.800
marching behind his dick.

29:55.900 --> 29:58.100
(laughter)

29:58.200 --> 30:01.000
So this one time,

30:01.100 --> 30:04.800
he was- he was playing,
uh, Little League,

30:04.900 --> 30:06.700
you know,
when he was about six.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.050
And I was the coach
of his team, you know,

30:09.085 --> 30:11.300
and Horace was out there
in right field,

30:11.500 --> 30:14.300
so right away you know
how good he was, right?

30:14.335 --> 30:17.100
'Cause how many kids
can hit away to right?

30:17.200 --> 30:19.500
So every day, he's out there
picking his nose

30:19.600 --> 30:21.900
and staring off, you know?

30:22.000 --> 30:25.865
And this one day, he comes
running over to the dugout

30:25.900 --> 30:29.400
and he says, "Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete,
I gotta make a pee-pee!"

30:29.500 --> 30:31.200
(laughter)

30:31.300 --> 30:34.900
I said, "Get the fuck back on the field!
What are you doing?"

30:34.935 --> 30:39.700
He says, "Time-out, Uncle Pete,
I gotta make a pee-pee!"

30:39.800 --> 30:42.100
I said, "I don't care if you
gotta make a doo-doo,

30:42.200 --> 30:44.100
"Horace, you little prick.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.200
Get back out there on the field!"

30:46.300 --> 30:50.000
So he starts crying, like...
(mimicking Horace crying)

30:50.100 --> 30:52.800
So I, you know, I called time-out.

30:52.900 --> 30:54.700
I go to the ump, time-out, you know,

30:54.800 --> 30:57.300
and then I go over to Horace
and I say,

30:57.400 --> 31:00.900
"Okay, I called time-out,
now you can go take a leak. "

31:00.935 --> 31:02.400
I mean, what am I gonna do?

31:02.500 --> 31:05.100
He's my nephew, you know,
and he's crying and everything.

31:05.200 --> 31:09.100
I say, "Okay, honey,
you gotta go to the toilet?

31:09.135 --> 31:11.000
You go ahead. "

31:11.100 --> 31:13.100
(laughter continues)

31:13.200 --> 31:16.700
He's still crying, so I said,
"What the fuck is the matter with you?

31:16.735 --> 31:19.800
You said you wanted to make a pee-pee,
now go make a pee-pee. "

31:19.900 --> 31:24.600
And he says,
"Uncle Pete, Uncle Pete, it's too late!"

31:24.700 --> 31:27.900
And he's covered with piss
all over his pants.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.100
Leon, I'm telling you,
he was covered and it was all smelly.

31:32.200 --> 31:34.100
You remember that?

31:34.200 --> 31:37.000
Horace, remember that, when you
pissed your pants in Little League?

31:37.100 --> 31:39.700
(laughter continues)

31:41.100 --> 31:43.700
That was a killer.
Leon, I'm telling you.

31:45.900 --> 31:48.500
- Hey, what about little Pete?
Did he play?

31:48.600 --> 31:51.300
- Yeah, yeah, Pete played.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.600
He was the best you ever saw.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.900
He got varsity baseball in high school,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.800
freshman in high school.

32:00.900 --> 32:04.200
He had a girlfriend,
straight A's.

32:08.700 --> 32:11.100
He's a good kid, too.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.900
- Hi, there.
May I have a Budweiser, please?

32:26.300 --> 32:29.300
- 4.50.
- Oh.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.000
- "Oh"?

32:31.100 --> 32:34.400
- I thought I heard you charge
that guy $3 for a Budweiser.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.400
- Don't worry about
what I charge him.

32:36.500 --> 32:39.600
- Well, I just don't get why
I have to pay more.

32:39.700 --> 32:43.200
- You don't have to pay more,
you can also get the fuck out.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.200
- Um, you can't just charge different
people different prices, that's not-

32:46.300 --> 32:48.300
- Hey, hey, kid.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.800
You gonna pay for this beer
or you gonna wear it?

32:51.900 --> 32:55.300
- Um...
- Listen, you mumbling little fuck,

32:55.335 --> 32:57.300
you say "um" one more time-
What?

32:57.400 --> 32:59.000
- What, what did I do?
- Pete.

32:59.100 --> 33:01.100
Just let me get it.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.300
I got it.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.900
- Hey, sorry.
- It's all right.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.565
- You all right? What's up?

33:10.600 --> 33:14.000
- Yeah, uh, I was charged 4.50...
- Yeah.

33:14.100 --> 33:16.600
...for a Budweiser
and that guy was charged $3.

33:16.700 --> 33:20.300
- Just not sure why the discrepancy.
- He's been coming here a long time.

33:20.400 --> 33:24.300
- Oh, so is that a privilege
for just that one guy or is-

33:24.400 --> 33:27.000
- Like, more people that get to pay-
- Some people pay 4.50,

33:27.100 --> 33:29.700
- some people pay three.
- Okay.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.800
Um, how do you decide that?

33:31.900 --> 33:33.865
Is there, like, a list, or...

33:33.900 --> 33:37.100
- If he looks like him,
he pays $3.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.800
If he looks like you, he pays 4.50.

33:39.900 --> 33:42.300
- So just out-and-out discrimination?

33:43.800 --> 33:46.500
Um, are you aware
how totally unfair

33:46.600 --> 33:48.900
and not okay that is?

33:49.000 --> 33:51.150
I'm not sure what group...

33:51.185 --> 33:53.300
I mean, I'm Jewish.
I'm gay.

33:53.400 --> 33:56.200
- Here's the thing- you're getting
more for your money than he is.

33:56.300 --> 33:59.000
- How so?
- Because, well,

33:59.100 --> 34:01.200
see, you come here
and you make fun of the place

34:01.300 --> 34:03.500
'cause it's an old Brooklyn dive bar,
so you and your friends

34:03.600 --> 34:06.300
get to enjoy that part of it
and then also you get to have a beer.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.000
But he just gets the beer.

34:08.100 --> 34:09.665
See, you're here ironically,

34:09.699 --> 34:13.199
but he's really here
'cause he just lives on the corner.

34:13.235 --> 34:15.900
- So it's like a douche tax?

34:15.935 --> 34:18.800
- Yeah, kinda.

34:18.900 --> 34:21.600
- Acceptable.
- Okay.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.500
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.699
- I'm gonna go upstairs for a minute.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.500
- Hello, Horace.
- Hello, Marsha.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.000
Ugh.

35:13.100 --> 35:15.500
I'm so tired.

35:16.900 --> 35:18.965
Oh...

35:19.000 --> 35:22.200
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?

35:22.400 --> 35:24.900
Because it's warm in here.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.900
My arms-
I have such nice arms.

35:37.100 --> 35:39.000
Arms.

35:39.100 --> 35:41.800
It's a funny word, isn't it?

35:41.900 --> 35:43.900
Arms.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.100
Hey.

35:47.200 --> 35:49.900
Do you want to hear
something funny?

35:50.000 --> 35:52.300
(giggling)

35:52.400 --> 35:56.400
I always wear a bikini
under my clothes.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.100
Do you think that's funny?

36:00.800 --> 36:02.400
I just think it's easier, you know?

36:02.500 --> 36:07.300
What if I want to just take
all my clothes off and be in a bikini?

36:07.400 --> 36:09.800
I can do that this way.

36:12.800 --> 36:16.600
I bet you never thought of me
as someone who would do that.

36:21.500 --> 36:24.700
- Jesus, what is wrong with you, huh?
- What?

36:24.900 --> 36:27.400
- I mean... ha!

36:27.500 --> 36:29.600
This is your fantasy?

36:29.700 --> 36:32.500
How is this a sex fantasy, huh?

36:32.600 --> 36:35.100
I mean, we're talking.
What, is that gonna get you there?

36:35.200 --> 36:36.600
- No.

36:36.700 --> 36:39.900
- Well, then, come on, let's get to
the fucking or whatever, huh?

36:40.000 --> 36:41.300
- I don't know.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.600
- Why?
Why are you hesitating?

36:43.700 --> 36:45.300
- Because this is weird.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.600
This is- this is fucked up.

36:47.700 --> 36:50.500
- It's a sex fantasy.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.700
- Yeah, but why can't I
have normal ones?

36:52.800 --> 36:55.000
Why can't I have normal sex fantasy-

36:55.100 --> 36:58.500
Why am I, like- like just jerking off
to the tits on the Internet.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.800
Why can't I be one of those people?

36:59.900 --> 37:02.800
Why- why am I sitting here
having this sick fantasy

37:02.900 --> 37:05.000
about my dead dad's...

37:05.100 --> 37:07.165
- Cum Dumpster.
- Yeah.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.600
And why am I thinking
about you saying that?

37:09.700 --> 37:12.900
That's... that's wrong.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.700
- Because it's sexy.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.000
I mean, it's weird, but...

37:18.100 --> 37:20.100
I mean, you're weird.

37:20.200 --> 37:23.150
I mean,
if you can't have, you know,

37:23.185 --> 37:26.100
whatever sex fantasy
you want to have,

37:26.300 --> 37:30.200
then, I mean, really,
what is the point in anything?

37:30.300 --> 37:31.700
- I guess this is the thing, right?

37:31.800 --> 37:34.500
I wish I was one of those people
that's, like, has clean sex.

37:34.600 --> 37:37.000
Nice, clean boners,
do you know what I mean?

37:37.100 --> 37:39.000
About good things, about love.

37:39.100 --> 37:41.700
People that get boners for people
they love and they have sex.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.600
And the whole time they're having sex,
they just smile at each other.

37:44.635 --> 37:46.600
(Marsha laughing)

37:48.400 --> 37:51.300
- What, like Obama?
- Yeah.

37:51.335 --> 37:53.200
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:53.300 --> 37:56.300
- So do you want me to be
Michelle Obama right now?

37:56.400 --> 37:58.100
- No, no.
- Oh.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.000
- No.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.500
No.

38:02.600 --> 38:06.200
I just- I bet when Obama
has sex with Obama,

38:06.300 --> 38:08.100
I bet they- it's really nice.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.700
I bet it's really nice and clean.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.600
And full of love.

38:13.700 --> 38:15.200
And then when they're done,

38:15.300 --> 38:19.300
he goes and he's president
and she goes and, you know...

38:20.700 --> 38:23.500
Why do me and Clinton
have to be such pigs?

38:26.400 --> 38:29.100
- Well, I mean,

38:29.300 --> 38:32.400
all hard-ons are gross, right?

38:32.500 --> 38:35.100
- Do you get- do you have,
like, gross fantasies?

38:36.900 --> 38:39.800
- What?

38:39.900 --> 38:42.200
- Why don't you go down and ask her?
- Oh, yeah, you're me.

38:42.300 --> 38:44.300
- Yeah.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.700
I mean, where did you
get this idea that, you know...

38:52.700 --> 38:55.900
that there are nice, clean hard-ons?

38:55.935 --> 38:57.800
Huh?

38:57.900 --> 39:00.600
I mean...

39:00.700 --> 39:03.900
sex is dirty, you know?

39:03.935 --> 39:05.500
It's dirty.

39:05.600 --> 39:09.000
It's really, really dirty.

39:09.100 --> 39:12.600
And wrong and gross...

39:12.700 --> 39:15.200
and messy...

39:15.300 --> 39:19.100
and, um, smelly...

39:19.200 --> 39:23.000
- and bad and...
- I just came.

39:23.100 --> 39:25.700
- Really?

39:25.800 --> 39:27.900
Oh, fuck.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.300
Jesus Christ.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.900
All right.

39:38.800 --> 39:41.000
- Do you want to play some cards
or something?

39:42.800 --> 39:44.200
- Yeah.

39:44.300 --> 39:46.800
- What do you say?
Let's get out of here.

39:46.835 --> 39:49.800
- What for?
- Let's go somewhere.

39:49.900 --> 39:52.800
I mean, these drinks are good
and everything, but let's hit the town.

39:52.900 --> 39:55.500
- Hit the town?
- Yeah, come on.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.750
Take you to a nice dinner.

39:57.785 --> 39:59.900
Let's- let's paint it red.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.300
- Why don't we just paint it red
right here?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.265
- Oh, no, listen.

40:04.300 --> 40:07.900
I'm a well-heeled guy.
You're a doll.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Let me show you
how a guy can treat a gal.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.400
- Yeah, I'm sure you know how.

40:12.500 --> 40:15.600
- I do, you'd have a ball, let's go.

40:15.700 --> 40:18.900
I know a great little joint
out by the ocean.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.700
We can walk in the waves afterward.
(chuckles)

40:24.400 --> 40:28.400
- I'm fine right here.
- You don't like me?

40:28.500 --> 40:32.200
- No, I like you fine,
I like you fine, stay, you know...

40:33.900 --> 40:36.100
Stay here and drink with me.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.900
- Yeah, I don't want to
do that, Marsha.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.800
It's not my thing.

40:42.500 --> 40:46.100
- Well, then, go home.
- I can't do that, my wife is there.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.200
(Marsha laughing)

40:53.700 --> 40:56.000
Ah, Jesus.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.100
- Uh, excuse me?

41:18.600 --> 41:21.300
Uh, excuse me?

41:21.400 --> 41:23.700
- Yeah, doll, what can I get you?

41:23.800 --> 41:26.500
- Can I get a white wine?
- We don't have that.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.800
Beer, hard drinks.
No wine, no mixed drinks.

41:29.900 --> 41:32.200
- Oh, that's fine.
I'll just have a beer, then.

41:32.300 --> 41:35.000
- All right.
- Oh, uh, what kind?

41:35.100 --> 41:37.200
- All's we got is Budweiser.

41:37.400 --> 41:40.500
- Oh, that makes it easier, then.
- Yeah.

41:41.900 --> 41:44.500
- Um, are you Uncle Pete?

41:44.600 --> 41:46.800
- Yeah, who's asking?

41:46.900 --> 41:48.165
- I thought that was you.

41:48.200 --> 41:51.200
I never met you before,
but I'm a friend of your nephew, Pete.

41:51.235 --> 41:53.700
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, is he around?

41:53.735 --> 41:55.300
- Yeah, yeah.

41:55.400 --> 41:57.400
Hold- hold on.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.700
Hey, Pete.

42:00.800 --> 42:03.300
Look at this broad
who's coming here asking for you.

42:03.400 --> 42:05.100
- She looks nice.
- Huh?

42:05.200 --> 42:08.300
- Horace, look at- look at this chick
who came in asking for Pete.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.600
- Oh, is that Trisha?
- Who's Trisha?

42:10.700 --> 42:12.800
- Yeah, I knew her at the hospital.

42:12.900 --> 42:14.300
- Well, how come you knew her?

42:14.400 --> 42:16.900
- 'Cause I used to visit him
at the hospital when you didn't.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.600
- We were in the same, uh...

42:19.700 --> 42:22.200
- I knew her at the hospital.
- What, is she a wacko, too?

42:22.300 --> 42:24.100
- Shut up, man.
- No, what?

42:24.200 --> 42:27.900
I mean, she don't look like a wacko, but
maybe she was in for something else,

42:28.000 --> 42:30.500
like drugs or syphilis or something.

42:30.600 --> 42:33.500
Anyway, she's cute,
she looks good.

42:33.600 --> 42:36.200
- Go say hi, go ahead.
- Nah.

42:36.300 --> 42:39.800
- Pete, go say hi to her.
- I don't want to.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.500
- Hey, Pete!
Hi, Horace!

42:42.600 --> 42:44.600
- Hi, Trisha.
- Hi, Trisha.

42:44.700 --> 42:47.700
- I'm gonna go upstairs and take a nap.
- No, come on, what are you doing?

42:47.800 --> 42:48.800
- Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.300
- What's the matter with you?
- Go say hi to her.

42:50.400 --> 42:53.900
- Yeah, come on, get in there.
- I don't want to.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.600
I mean, we were friends
at the hospital.

42:55.635 --> 42:57.200
I'm not in the hospital anymore.

42:57.300 --> 42:58.800
- I don't care where you met her,
you don't get in there

42:58.900 --> 43:00.800
and get her clothes off her,
or you're a fag.

43:00.900 --> 43:02.700
- Oh, shut up.
- Pete.

43:02.800 --> 43:05.000
(Trisha shouting, banging on table)

43:14.200 --> 43:17.800
- Holy fuck.
- She's got Tourette's.

43:17.900 --> 43:20.200
- What's that?
- It's a disorder.

43:20.300 --> 43:23.100
- Well, that's why he don't like her.
- No, it's not.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.700
It's got nothing to do with it.
And I like her fine.

43:25.800 --> 43:29.300
- So go talk to her.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.700
Pete, I remember Trisha,
she was really cool.

43:31.800 --> 43:33.900
- Just go say hi to her, she's cute.
- Come on.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.500
- Hey, Trisha.
- Hi, Pete.

43:43.300 --> 43:46.900
- How you been?
- I'm really well, thanks.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.165
Uh, how are you?

43:49.200 --> 43:51.600
- I'm all right.
- Good.

43:51.700 --> 43:54.400
- You look good.
- Thanks.

43:54.500 --> 43:57.800
You, uh...
It's nice to see you.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.665
- You know,
I think about you sometimes.

44:01.700 --> 44:04.300
I called you but you never
called me back and I-

44:04.400 --> 44:06.400
I remember you telling me
about this place

44:06.500 --> 44:08.365
and I loved hearing you
talk about it.

44:08.400 --> 44:11.800
Anyway, I just moved close to here
and I thought, what the hell?

44:11.900 --> 44:13.900
I'll just go by and see him.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.100
- Okay.

44:16.200 --> 44:18.165
- Hey, Pete, um...

44:18.200 --> 44:20.200
you know,
when we were in the hospital,

44:20.300 --> 44:22.665
you were such an important-

44:22.700 --> 44:26.100
- Okay, well, uh,
I'll see you around.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.700
- Fuck was that? Make an effort.
- What?

44:29.800 --> 44:32.800
- Come on, she's a wacko,
but she's very nice.

44:32.900 --> 44:34.900
And anyway,
she obviously likes you.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.900
And you know, anyway, you're-

44:37.000 --> 44:39.550
- I mean...
- What?

44:39.585 --> 44:42.100
I'm what? No, what?

44:42.200 --> 44:44.800
What, you think just because
she's got a disorder

44:45.000 --> 44:47.300
and I've got my thing
that I have to be with her?

44:47.400 --> 44:49.900
What the fuck is that?
I gotta stick with my own kind?

44:50.000 --> 44:52.150
"Just stay away from
the normal girls, Pete.

44:52.185 --> 44:54.300
Just stay with your own
fucked up kind, Pete. "

44:54.335 --> 44:56.200
- No, I'm not saying any of that.
- I am.

44:56.300 --> 44:57.900
Makes sense.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.600
I mean, you two wack jobs
should go together.

45:00.700 --> 45:02.500
Just don't have any babies.

45:02.600 --> 45:05.000
- What I'm saying is that
she's cute and she's nice

45:05.035 --> 45:07.100
and she likes you and you're 52,

45:07.200 --> 45:09.200
so how many more times
is that gonna happen for you?

45:09.300 --> 45:13.100
- Look, I knew her at the hospital,
we're not there anymore, that's that.

45:13.200 --> 45:15.800
- Trisha: Fuck your mother!
- Oh, hey, whoa.

45:15.835 --> 45:17.500
Watch your tongue there, Trisha.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.600
- Nigger cock!
Nigger cock!

45:19.700 --> 45:22.000
- I think I'm in love.

45:22.100 --> 45:24.800
Hey, Trisha, those are some pipes
you've got on you.

45:24.900 --> 45:27.200
- Sorry.
- No, no, that's all right.

45:27.300 --> 45:29.500
It's all right.
Forget about it, it's a free country.

45:29.600 --> 45:32.900
Look, I'm gonna give you another beer.
Free beer on the house.

45:33.000 --> 45:36.100
- Hey, could I ask you a question?
- Oh, sure.

45:36.200 --> 45:37.600
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi.

45:37.700 --> 45:41.100
- So, like, you have Tourette's, right?
- Yep.

45:42.500 --> 45:44.900
- So, like, how do you...

45:45.100 --> 45:47.200
live?

45:47.300 --> 45:49.550
I mean, like, you look like
you're doing okay,

45:49.585 --> 45:51.800
but can you, like,
suppress it when you have to?

45:51.900 --> 45:55.565
- No, in fact, if I have to suppress it,
I can't even more.

45:55.600 --> 45:59.500
It's like the worst outcome of the tics,
the more they want to come out.

45:59.600 --> 46:03.000
That's why I'm...
I'm really sorry I yelled that.

46:03.100 --> 46:05.900
It's like this itch you have to scratch
and I can only get to it

46:05.935 --> 46:08.200
by saying the worst thing
that I could ever say sometimes,

46:08.300 --> 46:11.600
depending on where I am, so you-
you being here made that come out.

46:11.700 --> 46:14.565
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

46:14.600 --> 46:18.400
I know by the way you said it,
you didn't have any hatred behind it.

46:18.435 --> 46:21.900
Also, it helped that you said
"cock" at the end.

46:21.935 --> 46:24.500
- I wasn't offended, either.

46:24.600 --> 46:27.400
- But, like, how do you live with it?

46:27.500 --> 46:29.865
Like, can you hold down a job?

46:29.900 --> 46:31.600
- I- I haven't kept a lot of them.

46:31.700 --> 46:34.865
I get fired a lot and have to
pound a lot of pavement

46:34.900 --> 46:37.700
to get a job in the first place 'cause
I have to tell them when I interview.

46:37.800 --> 46:40.400
But, um, you know,
it's trial and error.

46:40.500 --> 46:42.600
But I found a nice place.

46:42.635 --> 46:44.700
It works out, so far.

46:44.800 --> 46:48.000
I work really hard
and they gave me a private space,

46:48.200 --> 46:50.900
so it's not so bad and I have to be
a really nice person

46:51.000 --> 46:53.400
when I'm not yelling things
to make up for it.

46:53.500 --> 46:56.300
- I like you both ways.
- Fucking little faggot!

46:56.400 --> 46:58.400
- Hey.

46:58.500 --> 46:59.900
I'm not a faggot.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.400
- Hey, if you don't mind my saying so,

47:02.500 --> 47:05.500
I think it's pretty brave of you,
the way you handle that.

47:05.535 --> 47:07.400
Like, that cannot be easy.

47:07.500 --> 47:09.800
- Thank you.

47:09.900 --> 47:11.500
- She doesn't have to live with it.

47:11.600 --> 47:13.300
You could take that
Divolactin stuff

47:13.400 --> 47:15.600
and then your symptoms
would go away.

47:15.700 --> 47:19.600
- Yeah, but then I'd be asleep half
the day and I couldn't work.

47:19.700 --> 47:21.100
I mean, not like I do now.

47:21.200 --> 47:22.500
I mean... it's not easy.

47:22.600 --> 47:23.800
People stare at me.

47:23.900 --> 47:25.500
They- they just think I'm awful.

47:25.600 --> 47:27.465
People lecture me, insult me.

47:27.500 --> 47:29.700
And people who know what's wrong
with me just look away.

47:29.800 --> 47:30.900
I would.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.800
But I'd rather rough it and deal
with all that and have a life

47:34.900 --> 47:38.500
rather than just take Divolactin
and shut down.

47:38.600 --> 47:41.400
So far, it's worth it.

47:41.500 --> 47:44.100
- Yeah, well, I can't do that, Trisha.

47:44.135 --> 47:46.700
I go off my meds,
I lose my fucking mind.

47:46.800 --> 47:49.000
I can't do anything without Probitol,

47:49.100 --> 47:51.800
so I don't have the luxury
of that choice.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.800
- I know that, Pete.
I know that.

47:54.900 --> 47:58.000
- You knew Pete in the hospital?

47:58.100 --> 48:01.700
- Yeah, he... he really helped me.

48:01.800 --> 48:03.800
It's really scary in there.

48:03.900 --> 48:06.200
It's a scary place.

48:06.300 --> 48:08.800
But Pete wouldn't let
anybody bother me

48:08.900 --> 48:10.800
and he was a friend
when I needed one.

48:10.900 --> 48:12.400
He still hasn't let me thank him.

48:12.500 --> 48:15.500
He used to tell me stories
about Horace & Pete's

48:15.600 --> 48:17.800
and he would really crack me up.

48:17.900 --> 48:20.700
He told me really funny stories
about you, Uncle Pete.

48:20.800 --> 48:22.500
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

48:22.600 --> 48:25.265
- I feel like I know you.

48:25.300 --> 48:27.300
- Well, you're all right, Trisha.

48:27.400 --> 48:29.400
You're welcome here anytime.

48:29.500 --> 48:32.600
If anybody looks at you sideways,
I'll punch 'em in the fucking mouth.

48:32.700 --> 48:35.600
- Thanks.
You don't have to do that.

48:35.700 --> 48:37.200
It's just looking.

48:37.300 --> 48:39.100
Who cares if people look at me?

48:39.200 --> 48:41.800
If I cared, I wouldn't live much.

48:41.835 --> 48:43.200
- Hey, Pete.

48:43.300 --> 48:45.300
- Can I-
- Dirty applesauce tit fucker!

48:45.335 --> 48:47.800
- Jesus.
Can I get a whiskey?

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
- Hey, Marsha.
