- Hi, mrs. Baskets.
- Hi.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.142
- Hi.
- Look at these.
Look at this.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.144
Look at this.
Do you see me?

02:25.146 --> 02:27.579
Wow, that's
a great sweater set
that you're wearing.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.149
Well, it's right in the garage
if you ever want it.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.651
- Well--
- you know, I saved
all my clothes.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.486
- Oh, really?
- Is that a crazy thing?

02:34.488 --> 02:37.656
I don't know.
I thought, well, what if
I have twin girls?

02:37.658 --> 02:41.293
And that's my brother, jim.
He's a nice kid.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.195
And that's my mom.
How about her?

02:43.197 --> 02:44.496
- Wasn't she something?
- She looks great.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.598
Look at her,
what a looker she was.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.535
Here's my father.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.870
- Oh.
- I'm just
kidding.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.473
No, but I thought
I'd put this up.
What do you think?

02:54.475 --> 02:55.974
- Yeah, that would go--
- oh.

02:55.976 --> 02:59.178
- Look at cody and logan.
- Oh.

02:59.180 --> 03:02.181
- I got it off their facebook.
- Is that like an ad?

03:02.183 --> 03:04.683
I don't know what it is.
It's so pretty, though,
isn't it?

03:04.685 --> 03:08.220
Listen, mrs. Baskets,
I know it's only been
a couple of weeks--

03:08.222 --> 03:11.823
- Yes.
- But I made a missing flier
for chip at work.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.559
- A missing flier?
- Yeah, I'm worried.

03:13.561 --> 03:16.862
Lost!
God, where'd you get
that picture?

03:16.864 --> 03:18.664
I got it off
the internet.

03:18.666 --> 03:22.401
Yeah, what, most wanted?
I can't believe you did this.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.869
I'm really worried
about him,

03:23.871 --> 03:26.171
And I thought if
I put these up--

03:26.173 --> 03:28.807
Martha,
don't worry about this.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.376
This is what kids do.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.478
They try to get
your attention.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.414
And chip is
a master at that.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.217
When he was a kid,
he would go down to
the parsons.

03:38.219 --> 03:41.253
He would hide
in their boat,
of all things.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.387
He's okay.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.256
Have you checked
their boat?

03:44.258 --> 03:47.526
No, and I'm not gonna
check their boat.
He'll show up.

03:47.528 --> 03:51.830
I'm sure right now
chip is having
the time of his life.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.225
Hot.
It's hot.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.668
Okay,
that will be $15.87.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.304
Wow. For this?

05:39.306 --> 05:40.405
Yes.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.846
- Nothing's on sale?
- No.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.898
Sometimes they get in
the crevices.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.033
That's it.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.801
okay, uh--

06:09.803 --> 06:11.370

06:11.372 --> 06:13.004

15:36.369 --> 15:39.270
Hey, noodles,
can I talk to you
for a sec?

15:39.272 --> 15:40.972
- What's that?
- Can I talk to you?

15:40.974 --> 15:42.073
Yeah.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.574
Cool, so, yeah.

15:43.576 --> 15:48.646
Uh, I wanted to ask you,
like, what your plans are.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.115
My plans?

15:51.117 --> 15:53.384
I don't know,
I'm just along for the ride.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.386
You know, here to
check out the scenery.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.721
Like a tourist?

15:59.591 --> 16:03.094
Yeah, so like I noticed that
you've been carrying around
the soup ladle.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.096
Yeah.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.631
Morpheus gave me this.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.299
No big deal.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.969
So it is a big deal.
It's like an honor, man.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.604
Like, that is what puts
the lentils into the cup.

16:13.606 --> 16:17.475
I used to carry that,
and now, obviously, you do.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.643
You can have it
if you want.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.445
No, I don't want it
like that.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.681
I only became a clown
so that I could, like,
have a--

16:23.683 --> 16:26.117
Like, a part in this
freak family or whatever,

16:26.119 --> 16:28.252
And now, like,
you came along and,
like, whatever man,

16:28.254 --> 16:30.455
You're the better clown.
You get all the laughs,
so it's like--

16:30.457 --> 16:32.156
- Trinity, trinity--
- you know, just--

16:32.158 --> 16:35.593
I get all the laughs because
you're the straight man.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.362
I'm a bisexual woman.

16:38.964 --> 16:41.532
I meant in the vaudevillian--
in the vaudevillian sense.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.035
Okay, I'm sorry, like,
I didn't go to no
fancy ass, like,

16:44.037 --> 16:45.336
- Clown boarding school--
- trinity.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.438
So, I'm a street clown,
so maybe, like,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.340
Lower your language for me
or whatever.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.610
Why don't you go write your
like, little "I hop trains"
article

16:52.612 --> 16:54.178
For the wall street
journal, man,

16:54.180 --> 16:56.080
And just, like,
get out of my life.

17:02.654 --> 17:04.255
It's okay,
it's okay.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.062
Uh...

17:11.064 --> 17:12.263
Um...

17:15.167 --> 17:16.667
I like you,
I do,

17:16.669 --> 17:22.707
And where I come from,
the rodeo,

17:22.709 --> 17:27.412
Clowns, we work together,
right?

17:27.414 --> 17:29.414
All right.

17:30.182 --> 17:31.282
Okay.

17:40.225 --> 17:43.261
Oh, okay, okay.
I think you have
the wrong idea.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.396
You're confused
for my body.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.098
- It's okay.
- No.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.733
I'm okay.
You're not okay,

17:48.735 --> 17:51.402
'cause you're
missin' out on all...

17:51.404 --> 17:54.272
Of this, titties.
Good ones.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.143
Goodnight,
lady boy.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.416
If it means anything to you,
I have a--

18:05.418 --> 18:07.185
Terrible physique.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.432
Hey, everyone.
Gather around.

18:22.568 --> 18:25.203
Got a little over
70 bucks here.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.605
And, uh,
I think in large part
it's due to noodles.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.607
- Yeah, noodles.
- Hell, yeah, noodles.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.110
So I think
we should celebrate,

18:32.112 --> 18:33.778
And get some snacks.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.814
Snacks?
We need to get a tarp.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.449
Rain's coming.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.784
We could die if
we don't have shelter.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.086
I don't think it's
up to you, trinity.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.154
What do you think,
noodles?

18:43.156 --> 18:44.789
- Well--
- snacks or tarp?

18:44.791 --> 18:48.426
- I'd love some
pringles but--
- oh, man.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.094
- We could get--
we could get nachos.
- All right.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.497
Like, I've been here
way longer than him,

18:52.499 --> 18:55.733
But I get it.
I know when I'm
not wanted, so--

18:55.735 --> 18:58.436
You guys all set?
Goodbye forever.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.605
Trin, come on,
just calm down,
all right?

19:00.607 --> 19:03.274
Look, we get some snacks,
you'll be smiling again.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.442
- You know that.
- Trin.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.843
Trin,
don't freak out.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.779
Ahh! Shut up!
You sound like my pastor.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.915
Like, "oh, trinity,
how ya doin'?"

19:10.917 --> 19:13.184
"like, why don't you just,
like, calm down."

19:13.186 --> 19:15.353
Like, sorry, dude,
I'm not some
lobotomized robot,

19:15.355 --> 19:16.754
Like, I can't turn it
off and on.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.689
I think I'm awesome.
Obviously, you don't.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.658
How can you
leave this family?
Don't leave.

19:23.596 --> 19:26.564
You look so stupid.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.734
You have no idea
who these people are.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.374
Sorry you don't
find me attractive.

19:37.142 --> 19:38.242
Goodbye.

19:39.444 --> 19:42.780
Dude, just let her go.
She's feral.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.483
A lot of people out here,
they're just quitters.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.584
You know?

19:48.887 --> 19:51.289
It's raining.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.423
We gotta go.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.164
Yeah, there's newspapers
all over the lawn.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.800
No lights on.
I think somebody's
on vacation.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.969
I'm gonna go in.
Wish me luck.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.877
On the snack run,
just get me some
werther's originals, okay?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.714
Or some beef jerky.
Love beef jerky.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.351
Come on.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.286
- Go, go, go.
- Go where?

20:27.826 --> 20:29.961
Welcome home,
assholes.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.269
Uh--

20:38.271 --> 20:40.238
What happens when
these people come home?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.939
Uh, we'll be long gone.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.408
State farm home insurance

20:46.746 --> 20:49.714
What with trinity,
did you-- did you
sleep with her?

20:49.716 --> 20:52.850
- Is that the--
- what? No.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.919
I'm old enough
to be her ancestor.

20:54.921 --> 20:59.523
Well, you missed your shot,
'cause she is like--

20:59.525 --> 21:00.758
What do you mean,
she's like--

21:00.760 --> 21:01.792
We were just friends.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.427
She freaked out.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.730
Well, I feel bad about
how things worked out.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.265
I feel like it's my fault.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.668
man: Hands up, assholes!

21:12.771 --> 21:15.706
- Snack time.
