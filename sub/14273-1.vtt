01:22.015 --> 01:23.346
One

01:23.383 --> 01:24.816
between the eyes!

01:24.851 --> 01:26.978
Two

01:27.020 --> 01:29.113
between the eyes.

01:58.084 --> 01:59.881
- Out!
- What?

02:03.289 --> 02:05.223
- She was safe.
- She was out.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.192
She landed right there.
She's safe.

02:09.829 --> 02:11.490
Aw, come on.

02:11.531 --> 02:14.193
That's enough.
I don't want to hear another word.

02:14.234 --> 02:16.498
- You're gone!
- Yeah, I'm gone.

02:24.010 --> 02:27.007
My grandmother used to take
me to Washington Square Park...

02:28.882 --> 02:31.350
to watch Bobby Fischer
play 10 games at the same time.

02:31.384 --> 02:33.443
Queen me.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.421
He was five-six moves ahead
on each table.

02:37.423 --> 02:39.914
Anyway, he became
the world champ, didn't he?

02:39.959 --> 02:41.984
Then he lost his fucking mind.

02:45.298 --> 02:47.960
He became a raving paranoid.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.730
Being attacked
from all directions,

02:49.769 --> 02:51.794
he couldn't see
what was in front of him.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.107
Mate. Mate!

03:31.477 --> 03:34.002
My name is David Fisk,

03:34.047 --> 03:36.208
Detective First Grade.

03:37.417 --> 03:40.284
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for over 30 years.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.953
In that time...

03:45.558 --> 03:48.026
I've killed 14 people.

03:49.929 --> 03:51.920
Run that by me
one more time.

03:52.932 --> 03:55.492
I've killed 14 people.

03:55.535 --> 03:57.196
He's nuts.

03:59.672 --> 04:01.902
When did
these things start?

04:06.012 --> 04:08.173
How did they start?

04:13.286 --> 04:16.551
Maybe this one started
with a guy named Charles Randall.

04:22.161 --> 04:25.096
Randall was a child killer.

04:26.866 --> 04:29.232
He killed his girlfriend's daughter

04:29.269 --> 04:31.703
about four years ago.

04:33.039 --> 04:35.064
Fuck you, damn asshole.

04:36.342 --> 04:37.969
He was tried
for the crime,

04:38.011 --> 04:40.479
but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers.

04:54.994 --> 04:58.122
My partner and I
found this unacceptable.

05:01.901 --> 05:04.870
My partner is a good man.

05:25.892 --> 05:28.486
Are you really
gonna do this thing?

05:28.528 --> 05:30.553
Do what?

05:30.596 --> 05:33.030
You're going to
take down Randall

05:33.066 --> 05:35.227
for a homicide
he didn't commit.

05:40.106 --> 05:42.438
What am I gonna do?

05:42.475 --> 05:44.466
You're my partner.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.910
- You're my role model.
- Right.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.937
What am I gonna do
without a role model?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.150
We didn't have
this conversation.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.679
What conversation?

06:16.809 --> 06:18.572
It got done.

06:22.849 --> 06:25.909
Randall lost his freedom

06:25.952 --> 06:27.920
for the crime he didn't commit.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.852
I lost my faith.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.056
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

06:50.977 --> 06:54.112
You can take this
as a confession if you want.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.138
Whatever.

06:56.182 --> 06:58.980
A few weeks ago
things heated up.

06:59.018 --> 07:00.781
What do we got on him, Turk?

07:00.820 --> 07:05.223
Marcus Smith, AKA Spider...
big big dope deals,

07:05.258 --> 07:07.692
murders, extortion,
lots of nice things.

07:07.727 --> 07:10.059
He converted
this old abandoned bank

07:10.096 --> 07:12.223
into Club 404 of Harlem.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.892
Maybe when he sees us
he'll confess.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.901
What, you don't believe
in miracles?

07:15.935 --> 07:17.527
When you pick up a check
one day...

07:17.570 --> 07:19.902
one day,
then I'll believe in miracles.

07:19.939 --> 07:23.067
- Let's go. I'm buying.
- Yeah, that's a miracle I want to see.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.740
#We fly high, no lie #

07:29.782 --> 07:32.751
# You hear that?
You know this, balling #

07:32.785 --> 07:35.754
# Foreign rides outside #

07:35.788 --> 07:37.847
# It's like showbiz,
we in the building #

07:37.890 --> 07:40.085
# We stay fly, no lie... #

07:40.126 --> 07:41.889
This is where he launders
his money.

07:41.928 --> 07:45.887
Oh, yeah,
cleaning green green green.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.127
He's all business.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.366
I gotta take a leak.

08:01.113 --> 08:03.274
Oh, I'll just be a sec.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.783
I'm not peeking.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.217
No problem.

08:11.757 --> 08:14.282
- You guys are so lucky.
- Why is that?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.625
No line to the bathroom and...

08:18.564 --> 08:20.794
you get to pee standing up.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.664
Unzip, psss, zip.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.966
Badda boom badda bing,
you're out of here.

08:25.004 --> 08:29.407
Yeah, the big guy really outdid himself
on this thing.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.807
You want a bump?

08:30.843 --> 08:32.777
Where did you get that from?

08:32.812 --> 08:35.246
Spider. Supremo.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.674
Not bad.

09:45.718 --> 09:48.983
Not bad?
What the fuck were you looking for?

09:49.021 --> 09:51.421
Come on, Turk,

09:51.457 --> 09:53.448
you pulled my hair.

09:53.492 --> 09:56.689
Gee, my little sister used to
pull my hair harder than that.

09:56.729 --> 09:57.923
Whatever.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.194
I gotta go.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.646
- Where the fuck are you going?
- I'm tired.

10:17.683 --> 10:20.345
You're tired?
It's America, you whiny bitch.

10:20.386 --> 10:23.219
Why don't you fucking get in the cab
and do some honest work?

10:23.255 --> 10:26.122
Yeah, she's on her way.
She can't wait to see you.

10:26.158 --> 10:29.423
Rambo the Skateboard Pimp
was my 10th kill.

10:31.564 --> 10:35.261
Think of me as a street-sweeper.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.394
I cleaned up this worthless
piece of shit

10:37.436 --> 10:40.462
and left an obituary of sorts.
It rhymes.

10:49.348 --> 10:51.714
Rooster, we gotta find out
who did this.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.616
Give him a medal.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.486
Hey, Rambo, you see
who did this?

10:56.522 --> 10:58.490
He ain't talking, eh?

10:58.524 --> 11:00.719
Real name Robert Brady.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.751
Bobby Brady. Damn shame.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.626
What are you thinking?
Marcia? Greg?

11:06.132 --> 11:08.123
You guys messing up
my crime scene again?

11:08.167 --> 11:10.294
You don't know
who Bobby Brady is?

11:10.336 --> 11:12.327
Yeah, we met about an hour ago.

11:12.371 --> 11:15.135
- It looks like close range.
- From the stippling around the wound

11:15.174 --> 11:16.801
I'd say two to three feet away.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.572
We'll be fishing fragments
out of his brains.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.671
- What?
- No, I just got that...

11:21.714 --> 11:23.807
"Marcia? Greg?"
That's a good one, Rooster.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.578
Well, that was quick.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.449
Just trying to keep pace with you.

11:31.624 --> 11:34.752
"He trades in sin,
distributes flesh.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.160
He picks the fruit
when it is fresh.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.324
Now someone else
must slap his whore.

11:40.366 --> 11:45.099
His heart has stopped.
He breathes no more."

11:46.972 --> 11:48.997
What do you want to do
about this?

11:49.041 --> 11:51.839
I say let's make the best of it,

11:51.877 --> 11:55.005
canvass the hookers.
Maybe we'll meet one you like.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.676
Please. I got all I can handle
from you-know-who.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.515
No shit?

12:00.553 --> 12:03.647
She's got my sperm level so low
I gotta sit down to take a piss.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.350
Oh, thanks for that picture.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.655
Hey, what can I tell you?

12:07.693 --> 12:10.457
How can I help you, gentlemen?

12:10.496 --> 12:12.521
We'd like to talk to you
about your boss.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.829
He's upstairs.

12:14.867 --> 12:17.199
No, your other boss.

12:21.006 --> 12:22.997
Rambo.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.976
He is asshole.

12:25.010 --> 12:28.173
Why "he is asshole"?

12:28.214 --> 12:30.614
Follow me, please.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.014
You know anybody
who'd want to kill him?

12:37.056 --> 12:38.717
Me.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.055
Anyone else?

12:40.092 --> 12:42.083
Why? He's dead?

12:43.829 --> 12:46.354
Hey, listen, you want to smarten up
and help us out

12:46.398 --> 12:48.093
or am I gonna have to call
somebody at ICE

12:48.134 --> 12:49.897
and have you on the next plane
to kielbasa-land?

12:49.935 --> 12:51.766
Go ahead.

12:51.804 --> 12:53.704
I am American citizen.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.798
Yeah.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.900
Lick my balls anytime.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.535
What?

12:59.578 --> 13:01.569
Call us anytime, you know,

13:01.614 --> 13:04.014
if you hear something, anything.

13:06.385 --> 13:09.218
I think we're looking
for a guy named Sam the Butcher.

13:09.255 --> 13:11.723
Who?

13:11.757 --> 13:14.021
Nah, he's kidding around.
But seriously, Lieutenant,

13:14.059 --> 13:16.084
how far do you want us to go
with this Rambo murder?

13:16.128 --> 13:18.596
I don't know, I was thinking maybe
you could investigate it a bit more,

13:18.631 --> 13:21.031
figure out who did it,
try to put him in jail.

13:21.066 --> 13:23.933
That is, if it doesn't get in the way
of your shuffleboard lessons.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.493
Yeah, no problem.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.405
We're also working this dealer Spider
who's tied to these two stiffs

13:28.440 --> 13:29.737
we found on Fresh Kills.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.946
If we can nail him, who knows
how far up the ladder it will lead?

13:35.981 --> 13:37.107
So what about it?

13:37.149 --> 13:38.844
I popped this lawyer
with an ounce of blow.

13:38.884 --> 13:41.250
She practically shoved it up my nose.
I got her to flip on him.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.948
Lucky fuck, eh?

13:42.988 --> 13:44.615
She scored it from him directly?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.955
- Yeah, she did.
- Good.

13:46.992 --> 13:50.689
Okay, well, get what you can out of her
and kick her loose.

13:50.729 --> 13:53.165
I hate trying to prosecute
fucking lawyers.

14:01.907 --> 14:04.137
- This isn't Spider's club.
- The back way in.

14:04.176 --> 14:08.203
Yeah, it's an abandoned
linen factory, Jessica.

14:08.247 --> 14:11.182
I guess I'm not your average...

14:11.217 --> 14:12.707
what do you call it?

14:12.751 --> 14:14.742
- Rat?
- Stoolie?

14:14.787 --> 14:16.778
Thanks.

14:16.822 --> 14:20.519
I mean, I think usually
it's some poor African-American kid

14:20.559 --> 14:22.789
or a junkie or a prostitute.

14:22.828 --> 14:25.388
Well, normally 200-grand-a-year
corporate lawyers

14:25.431 --> 14:28.366
are much smarter than your average
African-American junkie whore...

14:28.400 --> 14:31.028
normally, but sometimes
they only think they are.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.937
It's all set
on this end.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.634
Are you guys sure
it's safe in there?

14:35.674 --> 14:38.734
You tell your girlfriend
to grow a pair and let's go.

14:38.777 --> 14:41.837
What do you say, Counsel?
Are you ready to do this thing?

14:41.881 --> 14:44.543
Yeah, let's get it over with.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.552
Okay, remember what we said?
You go in there,

14:47.586 --> 14:50.987
you wait for him to ask you
for what you need, right?

14:51.023 --> 14:53.651
And then you don't come back here
with less than four ounces.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.159
- Four ounces?
- Yeah.

14:55.194 --> 14:57.856
Isn't that a lot? I, like, buy a couple
of balls at the club, that's it.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.866
You just say you're going skiing and
you need a week's worth of fresh powder.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.232
Yeah, you tell him you're going
on vacation.

15:06.138 --> 15:09.869
I do this thing
and my record's wiped clean?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.206
As a whistle.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.211
No one at my law firm will know
that I got busted, right?

15:13.245 --> 15:14.769
It never happened.

15:15.881 --> 15:18.179
Look, Counsel, we all know you
better than this.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.811
You just do this, you stop
shoving that shit up your nose,

15:20.853 --> 15:22.616
you go home, you get married,
you have kids,

15:22.655 --> 15:25.317
you never come back here,
and that's that.

15:26.825 --> 15:29.157
Yeah.

15:29.194 --> 15:32.027
Everybody's in position.

15:32.064 --> 15:34.532
- Okay, we're going.
- Yes, sir.

15:36.835 --> 15:39.497
Let's push the signal
back 50%.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.531
Hey, Jessica.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.041
Break a leg.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.770
It's two flights down.

15:48.814 --> 15:51.180
The door's on the left.
Ring the bell.

15:58.223 --> 16:00.691
Hey, Stubby, why don't you
go and escort our company up here?

16:02.494 --> 16:04.519
Go on, fat boy.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.924
Get it on.

16:17.543 --> 16:20.239
- Good afternoon.
- Hey, Spider.

16:20.279 --> 16:22.770
- I'll be downstairs.
- All right.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.840
- How are you?
- All right, baby,

16:24.883 --> 16:27.249
just checking out this wizard shit
before I let my kids watch it.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.754
- You seen this?
- No.

16:29.788 --> 16:32.256
The guy is a stone dealer.
I let my little ones watch this...

16:32.291 --> 16:34.555
they'll all turn out junkies.
You know what I'm saying?

16:34.593 --> 16:36.083
He's got a point.

16:36.128 --> 16:38.323
- You remember Underdog?
- What about him?

16:38.364 --> 16:41.299
That fucking dog spawned
a generation of junkies.

16:41.333 --> 16:45.167
So you converted the bank
into a club and a recording studio?

16:45.204 --> 16:47.764
- Yeah. You like it?
- Yeah.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.706
What are you talking about?

16:49.742 --> 16:51.471
What did Underdog do
all the time?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.205
He was always shining shoes

16:53.245 --> 16:55.406
and whenever Sweet Polly Purebred
would call out to him,

16:55.447 --> 16:57.415
his dog ears would pick it up
and he'd rescue her.

16:57.449 --> 16:59.917
Yeah, but what did he do
when he needed his super strength?

16:59.952 --> 17:02.113
He'd go to his ring, remember?

17:02.154 --> 17:04.019
Pull out a pill, pop it.

17:04.056 --> 17:07.548
Holy shit, you're right.
He was a little fucking speed freak.

17:07.593 --> 17:08.924
So what's the business?

17:08.961 --> 17:11.794
How about a QP?
You're good for a QP.

17:11.829 --> 17:13.491
The fuck you want with QP?

17:13.531 --> 17:16.160
I'm going skiing with friends,

17:16.201 --> 17:18.761
a lot of friends.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.238
- Where?
- Aspen, Colorado.

17:21.272 --> 17:24.002
Shit. I'm sure you can
score one in Aspen.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.034
Not your primo brand.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.479
You ski?

17:28.513 --> 17:30.004
Sure. My whole life.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.177
Come on, I don't have all day.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.550
Why don't you put down your jacket,
stay a little while?

17:35.587 --> 17:36.781
What do you think?

17:36.822 --> 17:38.380
Actually,
I've got to run.

17:38.424 --> 17:42.326
I have a major IPO
closing in an hour, so...

17:42.361 --> 17:45.091
You know, stress will kill you.
You gotta chill out.

17:46.465 --> 17:48.399
I'm as chill as I get.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.425
What do you want to do?

17:53.772 --> 17:56.172
You know, every once in a while...

17:58.343 --> 18:00.402
one of you Upper East Side bitches
gets popped,

18:00.446 --> 18:02.437
tries to to roll over
on a nigga like me.

18:02.481 --> 18:04.574
You're scared now.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.847
Looks like the cavalry
come to rescue you.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.380
Can I help you, gentlemen?

18:13.425 --> 18:14.858
Yeah, let us in, Spider.

18:14.893 --> 18:17.088
I'm sorry, there's no one here
by that name.

18:17.129 --> 18:20.030
- Let us in.
- We only want to talk to you.

18:22.734 --> 18:25.635
See, I know how to look
and I know where to look.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.545
Come to papa.

18:35.247 --> 18:36.908
It always hurts the first time.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.547
You all right?

18:39.585 --> 18:41.382
Why wouldn't she be all right?
We're watching TV.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.081
How the fuck is she gonna get hurt
watching TV?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.716
She could have seen or heard
something that scared her.

18:45.757 --> 18:47.657
- Like what?
- Like some big fucking mutt

18:47.693 --> 18:49.217
shooting his bug fat
fucking mouth off.

18:49.261 --> 18:52.128
Wasn't nobody here fitting that description
till a minute ago.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.064
I'm gonna show you ugly,
you fucking mother...

18:54.099 --> 18:56.567
- We've said enough.
- Oh, you finna bring your wife up in here?

18:56.602 --> 18:59.662
That's it. That's it.
Let's go. It's okay.

18:59.705 --> 19:02.435
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.442
You want your wire back?

19:06.044 --> 19:07.909
Firearm!

19:07.946 --> 19:09.038
No, Stubby, no!

19:17.823 --> 19:19.654
Get down.
Get the fuck down!

19:29.434 --> 19:30.901
Come on.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.734
The fat one's dead.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.247
Well, that went well.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.018
Oh, shit, you're bleeding.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.115
3-4 squad, Central.
11-41, request ambulance.

19:52.157 --> 19:54.955
I need EMS. Subject shot,
184th and St. Nicholas.

19:54.993 --> 19:57.188
Really, I tried my best.

19:57.229 --> 20:00.528
You're doing just fine, Counsel.
You're doing just fine. Just relax.

20:00.566 --> 20:03.660
Hey, guys, if you ever
need a lawyer...

20:03.702 --> 20:06.432
Yeah, okay.

20:06.471 --> 20:08.939
You bet.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.907
In good old days
we used to

20:13.946 --> 20:16.676
let the perp bleed out
and call off the ambulance.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.649
- Calm calm calm.
- Fucking lowlife.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.481
You made your point.
You made your point.

20:20.519 --> 20:22.817
Tough little bitch, ain't you,
kicking a man while he's handcuffed?

20:22.854 --> 20:25.345
Shut the fuck up,
you piece of shit.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.017
You think I won't blow
your fucking head off?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.822
I wouldn't think twice
about it.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.124
I'd go in there,
get the fat boy's gun,

20:31.163 --> 20:34.826
come back here
and put two between your eyes.

20:39.638 --> 20:41.629
Where's EMS?

20:41.673 --> 20:44.870
This thing was a clusterfuck
to end all clusterfucks.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.468
You got nothing.

20:46.511 --> 20:48.479
How about felony murder?

20:48.513 --> 20:51.004
No drugs, right?
So no predicate felony,

20:51.049 --> 20:52.949
no conspiracy,
no nothing.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.010
No felony. No felony.
I can't believe this.

20:55.053 --> 20:56.782
No felony.
How do you spell felony?

20:56.822 --> 21:00.155
Homicide, racketeering, drugs...
I mean, what are we talking about?

21:00.192 --> 21:02.820
Hey, you're lucky
that white girl didn't die.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.761
IAB is gonna interview
both of you

21:04.796 --> 21:07.264
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks.

21:07.299 --> 21:10.791
Now off the record
you actually didn't violate procedure

21:10.836 --> 21:13.270
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you,

21:13.305 --> 21:15.535
so if you stick together
you should make it through this.

21:15.574 --> 21:17.565
You'd better get
your story straight too,

21:17.609 --> 21:20.442
'cause I'm not going back to Far Rockaway
because you two fucked up.

21:20.479 --> 21:23.073
And you're gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.915
And you'd better take this shrink seriously
or you'll be off active duty.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.715
That fucking piece of shit
just walks.

21:28.754 --> 21:30.551
Knock it off, Turk.

21:33.058 --> 21:35.686
Relax, partner.
He's gonna get his.

21:35.727 --> 21:38.252
Gentlemen, your questions.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.697
- Who made the decision to enter?
- I did.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.723
- Whose decision was it to enter?
- Mine.

21:42.768 --> 21:45.066
Did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers?

21:45.103 --> 21:47.401
- Yes, we did.
- Did you immediately identify yourselves?

21:47.439 --> 21:49.930
The informant's position
was becoming untenable.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.239
- We were afraid she was in danger.
- Turns out you were right.

21:52.277 --> 21:54.768
- No fucking kidding, nine-to-fiver.
- Excuse me, Detective?

21:54.813 --> 21:57.213
Are you finished
with my client?

21:59.184 --> 22:03.143
- They're like Lennon and McCartney.
- Not an inch of daylight between them.

22:03.188 --> 22:04.416
What do you think?

22:04.456 --> 22:05.753
Nothing there.

22:05.791 --> 22:08.658
They endangered the informant.
We can't make them wrong on that.

22:08.694 --> 22:10.321
They saw a gun, they reacted.

22:10.362 --> 22:12.125
They beat the fuck
out of the suspect,

22:12.164 --> 22:14.257
but he's not filing charges.

22:14.299 --> 22:16.358
Let's see what the shrink says.

22:17.369 --> 22:19.769
So what are we gonna
do now, Doc?

22:19.805 --> 22:22.000
Are we gonna find out
if I'm sane enough

22:22.040 --> 22:24.770
to carry a gun,
chase bad guys?

22:24.810 --> 22:27.404
Okay, why did you become a cop?

22:27.446 --> 22:30.176
Well, it was New Year's Eve.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

22:30.215 --> 22:34.117
I didn't have the same opportunities
you had, Dr. Prosky.

22:34.152 --> 22:36.848
Where I come from
it was either a gun and a badge

22:36.888 --> 22:38.753
or a hard hat and a hammer.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.258
How do you feel
when you fire your weapon?

22:41.293 --> 22:44.023
It's like Dirty Harry said...
"There's nothing wrong

22:44.062 --> 22:46.690
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot."

22:46.732 --> 22:48.666
And when the wrong people
get shot?

22:48.700 --> 22:51.669
It sucks, but I'd rather be in it
that out of it.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.796
There's nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench.

22:53.839 --> 22:56.069
How do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed?

22:56.108 --> 22:58.338
You know...

23:00.112 --> 23:03.309
I sort of get numb to it.

23:03.348 --> 23:06.010
Here.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.541
I want you to take this.

23:07.586 --> 23:10.953
Use it to jot down your thoughts,
your questions,

23:10.989 --> 23:13.480
anything you may have noticed
about yourself,

23:13.525 --> 23:14.992
whatever.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.857
I won't ask for it.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.659
Just for you.

23:19.698 --> 23:21.188
I want you to try it.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.258
Sounds like fun.

23:25.137 --> 23:28.698
Harder.

23:43.388 --> 23:44.719
Go, Turk, go!

23:46.091 --> 23:49.151
You got third.
Go go!

23:49.194 --> 23:51.890
Yeah!
Look at that.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.296
You own it. You own it.

23:54.332 --> 23:56.197
No matter what they say
about you,

23:56.234 --> 23:58.327
you're tremendous!

24:00.405 --> 24:02.737
Go go, Turk, go!

24:04.576 --> 24:06.669
Safe.
You dropped the ball.

24:06.711 --> 24:09.043
- A fucking cheap shot, man.
- Get away from the bag.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.015
- Or what? Or what? Or what?
- Watch the bag.

24:23.662 --> 24:26.096
The NYPD is bubbling
with frustration,

24:26.131 --> 24:27.723
hostility and testosterone,

24:27.766 --> 24:29.757
ready to erupt
at any moment.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.826
Think of me
as the release valve.

24:31.870 --> 24:34.703
One flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down.

24:34.739 --> 24:36.832
You know why
you join the force?

24:36.875 --> 24:38.968
To get respect.

24:39.010 --> 24:40.739
Most people respect the badge.

24:40.779 --> 24:43.111
Everybody respects the gun.

24:48.553 --> 24:50.544
Hey, Riley, I was talking to JD...

24:50.589 --> 24:53.649
you guys caught a stiff named
Phillip Trager, a gun-runner?

24:53.692 --> 24:55.922
Oh, yeah, a real piece of shit.

24:55.961 --> 24:57.895
- How did that go down?
- I don't know.

24:57.929 --> 25:00.193
Somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine, I guess,

25:00.232 --> 25:02.632
walked right into his apartment,
killed him with one of his own guns.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.931
Did the shooter leave a note
or anything?

25:04.970 --> 25:07.939
Yeah, actually,
the shooter left a poem.

25:11.042 --> 25:13.567
He did?
No shit.

25:13.612 --> 25:15.603
Yeah. Hey, Simon,

25:15.647 --> 25:19.083
you remember that poem
from the Trager case?

25:21.086 --> 25:23.145
What are you doing, man?

25:23.188 --> 25:25.179
Turk's asking about it.

25:25.223 --> 25:27.691
What the hell are you doing?

25:27.726 --> 25:30.160
¿Qué mierda 'tas haciendo ahí, papá?

25:30.195 --> 25:32.129
No le digas mierda a eso loco.

25:32.163 --> 25:35.792
Cálmate. He wants to hear
about the poem.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.064
"Merchant of thieving class,

25:38.103 --> 25:41.231
I slit his throat
and capped his ass.

25:41.273 --> 25:42.740
I took his gun, I took his...

25:42.774 --> 25:45.766
I took his life, I took his gun,
But too bad he's not the only one."

25:45.810 --> 25:47.869
That's how it goes,
something like that.

25:47.913 --> 25:50.211
It's not iambic pentameter,
but it rhymes.

25:50.248 --> 25:52.239
- Rooster.
- Yo.

25:53.251 --> 25:55.151
We're looking for the same guy.

25:55.186 --> 25:58.349
He knocked off a pimp named Rambo
a few weeks ago. When was yours?

25:58.390 --> 26:00.915
Last week. We're running ours with the ATF
because of the guns.

26:00.959 --> 26:04.019
We're back in business on the Rambo case.
Looks like the same guy knocked off

26:04.062 --> 26:06.496
- a gun dealer on the three-three last week.
- No shit.

26:06.531 --> 26:09.500
- What do you mean? That's our case.
- That's our case. You're taking our case.

26:09.534 --> 26:12.002
Seniority, guys.
Tag along, you'll learn something.

26:12.037 --> 26:14.198
Oh, tell me the guy's name
is Greg Brady.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.207
Please. It is, isn't it?

26:16.241 --> 26:18.801
Oh, somebody's knocking off
the Brady Bunch.

26:18.843 --> 26:22.711
Gotta be the Partridge Family.

26:22.747 --> 26:25.807
Trager,
a gun-runner bites the dust...

26:25.850 --> 26:27.909
number 11.

26:36.294 --> 26:40.094
The bullet matched the.45
in Trager's apartment.

26:40.131 --> 26:42.599
That was no surprise.
So I ran it through ATF.

26:42.634 --> 26:45.660
It's one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop

26:45.704 --> 26:48.002
- in Virginia last month.
- Yeah, probably by Trager.

26:48.039 --> 26:50.735
That's what they think.
He matches the description they have.

26:50.775 --> 26:53.471
It still doesn't help us find the guy.
It just helps us tie him to the victims,

26:53.511 --> 26:56.002
which he's already doing
with his little fucking poems.

26:56.047 --> 26:59.107
Excuse me. Hello.

26:59.150 --> 27:02.381
Hey, Turk, don't forget
we got a court date later.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.583
So...

27:05.624 --> 27:09.253
I heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.125
Spider.

27:11.162 --> 27:12.322
So?

27:13.999 --> 27:16.490
Did he?

27:19.337 --> 27:21.965
Yeah, he got him
down on the ground.

27:22.007 --> 27:24.407
The guy was handcuffed.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.504
And he just started
kicking him in the gut.

27:28.546 --> 27:30.946
And then

27:30.982 --> 27:33.314
he gets down on the guy's chest

27:33.351 --> 27:36.684
and he really starts smacking him

27:36.721 --> 27:39.656
hard in the face over and over

27:39.691 --> 27:41.682
and screaming at the top
of his lungs,

27:41.726 --> 27:43.990
"I'm gonna break
your fucking face,

27:44.029 --> 27:46.429
you little bitch!"

27:46.464 --> 27:48.796
Then his eyes really started
to fill up.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.824
I mean, they get dark...

27:50.869 --> 27:53.030
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.834
I thought he was gonna
kill this guy.

27:58.209 --> 28:00.677
Really?

28:03.381 --> 28:05.781
You're a bad little girl.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.682
Hmm?

28:07.719 --> 28:10.779
- I got work to do.
- You bet.

28:12.757 --> 28:16.158
Counselor,
my hands are tied here.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.185
Without a secure
chain of custody,

28:18.229 --> 28:20.959
any evidence obtained
after the initial search

28:20.999 --> 28:23.467
- must be excluded.
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

28:23.501 --> 28:25.867
Therefore I am forced
to grant defense

28:25.904 --> 28:28.202
motion to dismiss
all charges

28:28.239 --> 28:30.434
of rape and assault
against Mr. Van Luytens.

28:30.475 --> 28:32.466
- Your Honor.
- You think I want this guy

28:32.510 --> 28:34.671
going anywhere
near my daughter,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.874
or anyone's daughter
for that matter?

28:36.915 --> 28:39.383
You messed up.
I am unleashing your client

28:39.417 --> 28:41.681
unto the world.
I'm sure we'll all be

28:41.720 --> 28:43.153
back here again very soon.

28:43.188 --> 28:46.180
Look at him.
Look at this motherfucker.

28:46.224 --> 28:49.819
Hey, it's gonna come back to you, mutt.
You're gonna get it.

28:49.861 --> 28:52.295
- When you walk outside watch your back.
- Easy, Turk.

28:52.330 --> 28:53.490
Order in my court.

28:53.531 --> 28:56.796
- Okay, mutt? You fucking mutt.
- Not here, not now.

28:56.835 --> 28:59.269
Not here, not now.
Will you get him out of here

28:59.304 --> 29:01.864
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you can't appeal?

29:01.906 --> 29:03.134
Order!

29:03.174 --> 29:06.302
- You know what I mean? Go go.
- Order, Detective.

29:06.344 --> 29:10.303
Dr. Prosky suggested
that I free-associate.

29:10.348 --> 29:12.748
So here I go.

29:12.784 --> 29:15.412
You know what I think about
when I pull a trigger?

29:15.453 --> 29:18.388
I think about the Infield Fly Rule.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.449
I love that fucking rule.
It assumes the worst in everybody.

29:21.493 --> 29:25.190
It says, "Sorry, batter, you're a schmuck
for popping up with runners on.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.630
And you, stupid-ass infielder,
you don't get to cheat

29:27.665 --> 29:30.099
and drop the ball just because
you caught a break."

29:30.135 --> 29:31.796
My favorite part...
the batter's out

29:31.836 --> 29:33.997
but the runners advance
at their own risk.

29:34.038 --> 29:36.302
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise?

29:36.341 --> 29:38.434
That's the way
life should be.

29:38.476 --> 29:40.467
You can be a motherfucker
at your own risk.

29:43.782 --> 29:47.616
Or not.
Van Luytens... one less rapist.

29:47.652 --> 29:49.882
Who's gonna miss him?
Nobody.

29:49.921 --> 29:52.082
Number 12 and counting.

30:06.337 --> 30:08.237
Whoa whoa, hot coffee.

30:08.273 --> 30:09.968
- Good morning, Detective Riley.
- Hey, good morning.

30:10.008 --> 30:11.976
- Door on your left.
- Any signs of forced entry?

30:12.010 --> 30:13.705
Doesn't look like it.
Detective Perez is in there.

30:13.745 --> 30:15.144
He's in there already?
All right.

30:15.180 --> 30:17.307
- Hey, how about those Mets last night?
- Yeah, how about 'em?

30:17.348 --> 30:19.407
Hey, Teddy, Teddy, come here,
check this out.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.185
Wow.

30:23.221 --> 30:24.449
Fuck.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.287
- Oh my God.
- That's big.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.316
And powerful.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.227
- What, a plasma screen?
- LCD.

30:32.263 --> 30:34.322
- That's plasma.
- No, it's got to be LCD.

30:34.365 --> 30:36.663
- It wouldn't be that big.
- Hey, guys, guys.

30:36.701 --> 30:40.137
He was shot at close range,
dropped right here.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.935
The pussy doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight, does he, Karen?

30:42.974 --> 30:45.033
Nothing to indicate that

30:45.076 --> 30:48.603
in terms of struggle.
No forced entry, cuts, bruises.

30:48.646 --> 30:51.877
Hey, nobody wants to hear
about your private life, Officer Corelli.

30:51.916 --> 30:55.147
That's detective to you,
Officer Needledick.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.120
- Ooh.
- Ouch.

30:57.155 --> 30:59.487
- Looks like it's our guy again.
- Who did you get this time?

30:59.524 --> 31:01.185
This is Jonathan Van Luytens.

31:01.226 --> 31:03.160
He owns a couple
of car dealerships.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.526
- Oh, shit.
- He was up on rape charges,

31:05.563 --> 31:07.758
but they got tossed out
last week.

31:07.799 --> 31:09.790
Look at this.

31:09.834 --> 31:13.930
"A man devoid of all respect,
Of beauty, charm or intellect,

31:13.972 --> 31:16.406
He took what women
would not give.

31:16.441 --> 31:18.375
He didn't have
the right to live."

31:18.409 --> 31:20.775
That's our boy all right.

31:20.812 --> 31:23.975
Looks like he had a beef
with our old pal Jonny.

31:24.015 --> 31:25.107
You know him?

31:25.149 --> 31:27.014
Yeah.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.349
He's one slippery
son of a bitch, let me tell you.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.055
Yeah.

31:32.090 --> 31:35.218
You guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer?

31:35.260 --> 31:36.989
You got a point here, Lieutenant?

31:37.028 --> 31:38.791
The point is

31:38.830 --> 31:40.957
you'd better both
think seriously

31:40.999 --> 31:43.092
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case.

31:43.134 --> 31:44.795
You don't think
we're up to this?

31:45.803 --> 31:49.000
Come on, you got what,

31:49.040 --> 31:51.736
about 110 years on the job
between the two of you?

31:51.776 --> 31:54.836
120.

31:54.879 --> 31:57.143
I'm telling you, you screw it up
badly enough,

31:57.181 --> 31:59.376
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.645
You want to risk that?

32:00.685 --> 32:02.516
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah.

32:02.553 --> 32:07.513
406, Lieutenant. 406.

32:07.558 --> 32:10.152
Okay, 406...
what does that mean?

32:10.194 --> 32:11.718
Ted Williams.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.823
Ted Williams, the last day of the season,
is batting 400.

32:14.866 --> 32:17.960
Sox manager wants to bench him,
protect his average, right?

32:18.002 --> 32:19.799
Williams plays
both games anyway,

32:19.837 --> 32:21.805
goes six for eight,
ends up at 406...

32:21.839 --> 32:23.534
the last guy that ever hit
over 400.

32:23.574 --> 32:26.065
Okay, fine. It's all yours.

32:26.110 --> 32:29.136
Just don't go moaning to me
when some traffic cop

32:29.180 --> 32:31.478
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding

32:31.516 --> 32:34.144
and he grabs your
15 minutes of fame and you realize

32:34.185 --> 32:37.348
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you

32:37.388 --> 32:40.448
and it would have taken you
1000 light years to nail him.

32:40.491 --> 32:42.220
Not for nothing, Lieutenant,

32:42.260 --> 32:45.320
light years measures distance,
not time.

32:47.732 --> 32:50.200
Well, thank you, Detective.
I'll make a note of that.

32:50.234 --> 32:53.067
Ellis Lynde, 2003.

32:53.104 --> 32:55.868
This guy had a history
of cruising gay bars,

32:55.907 --> 32:58.705
picking up twinkies,
beating the shit out of them.

32:58.743 --> 33:01.644
Lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment.

33:01.679 --> 33:04.580
Whoever's doing this
gets up real close to the guys,

33:04.615 --> 33:07.277
blows their brains out
without any trouble,

33:07.318 --> 33:08.808
leaves no fingerprints

33:08.853 --> 33:10.650
and obviously
takes pride in his work.

33:10.688 --> 33:14.988
Okay, what could be
murder number two back from '04,

33:15.026 --> 33:16.459
one Matthew Mitrella.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.559
I was shaking
the first couple of times

33:23.601 --> 33:26.434
I killed in cold blood.

33:26.471 --> 33:29.804
I kept thinking if I got caught
they'd kick me off the force.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.469
I wasn't worried about prison,
but losing the gun and the shield...

33:32.510 --> 33:33.738
that scared me.

33:33.778 --> 33:36.269
I went into work the next day
expecting to feel different.

33:36.314 --> 33:39.408
I thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians

33:39.450 --> 33:41.680
and know which ones are dirty.

33:48.659 --> 33:50.991
But they didn't.
That's when I knew

33:51.029 --> 33:53.623
I could keep on
doing this forever.

33:56.768 --> 34:00.704
So next stop... Spider.

34:00.738 --> 34:02.729
If we shut down his business,

34:02.774 --> 34:04.765
maybe he'd be a rat.

34:04.809 --> 34:06.800
We got a lawyer.

34:06.844 --> 34:10.610
We needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him.

34:10.648 --> 34:13.208
She was a good lawyer.

34:13.251 --> 34:17.710
Me and my partner paid a visit
to Club 404 of Harlem.

34:17.755 --> 34:18.880
A word about him...

34:18.922 --> 34:22.016
Tom Cowen's been my partner
for almost 30 years.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.994
He's the best cop
I've ever seen.

34:25.897 --> 34:29.424
I'm always the one
following him through the door.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.628
There's a bullet
that was meant for me

34:31.668 --> 34:35.230
that's lodged in his torso.

34:35.273 --> 34:37.331
He was my role model.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.741
The day I stopped
trying to be Tom Cowen

34:39.777 --> 34:42.245
was the greatest day
of my life.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.086
Hey, Rooster,

34:59.130 --> 35:02.156
I was going through the files
on poetry boy.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.430
That's an interesting way
to pass your time.

35:04.469 --> 35:06.903
Okay, there was a gun

35:06.938 --> 35:09.099
found on Charles Randall
when he was arrested.

35:09.140 --> 35:10.368
Yeah.

35:10.408 --> 35:13.571
Now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene,

35:13.611 --> 35:16.774
but there are a lot of similarities.
So I mentioned it to Perez and Riley.

35:16.814 --> 35:18.873
I think somebody should go
interview him in prison.

35:18.916 --> 35:21.544
I think there may be a connection.

35:21.586 --> 35:25.044
That's a good idea,
but not Perez and Riley.

35:25.089 --> 35:27.523
I mean, not those guys.
They'll screw it up.

35:27.558 --> 35:29.685
This is too important.

35:29.727 --> 35:32.195
Turk and I will handle Randall, okay?

35:32.230 --> 35:33.788
Good work.

36:05.229 --> 36:07.595
Detectives, Charles Randall.

36:09.433 --> 36:12.561
What the fuck
do you two scumbags want?

36:12.603 --> 36:15.299
What a greeting.

36:15.339 --> 36:18.399
You like poetry, Chuck?

36:18.442 --> 36:19.500
What?

36:19.544 --> 36:22.741
Do you like poetry?

36:23.781 --> 36:27.478
Yeah.
Roses are red, violets are blue,

36:27.518 --> 36:30.453
I want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick, you fuck.

36:30.488 --> 36:32.479
How's that?

36:32.523 --> 36:35.151
I thought you'd rhyme.
You didn't.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.354
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

36:37.395 --> 36:39.022
Get me out of here.

36:49.006 --> 36:51.304
Why the fuck did we even bother
going out there?

36:51.342 --> 36:53.435
What would it look like
if we didn't go?

36:55.179 --> 36:57.374
Are you gonna relax?

36:57.415 --> 36:59.406
Relax.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.350
Yeah, I'll just take it out
on Karen later.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.683
The more I'm with her,
the more abuse she wants.

37:03.721 --> 37:04.983
Sounds like fun.

37:05.022 --> 37:06.614
Hey, you want to take her
off my hands?

37:06.657 --> 37:11.117
Be careful, partner, because I have
a very special effect on women.

37:11.162 --> 37:12.356
Go wild.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.795
Whatever.

37:13.831 --> 37:16.823
I can't believe I had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot.

37:16.867 --> 37:20.166
Eh, fuck him.
He's where he belongs.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.831
I'm sorry, partner,
I'm really sorry.

37:21.872 --> 37:24.807
Stop worrying about it.

37:26.644 --> 37:30.341
Whatever happens,
I'm not taking you down with me.

37:30.381 --> 37:33.350
Don't worry about me.
I'm all right, believe me.

37:33.384 --> 37:36.649
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just don't know what I was thinking.

37:36.687 --> 37:39.019
You know what you was thinking?
You were thinking

37:39.056 --> 37:41.718
about a 10-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed.

37:42.727 --> 37:45.195
Yeah, I tried to stop you,
but you know what?

37:45.229 --> 37:49.495
I admired you that day,
what you did.

37:49.533 --> 37:52.502
That was righteous.

37:52.536 --> 37:56.370
And you don't second-guess yourself
on something like that.

38:03.381 --> 38:05.372
Okay, I'm the killer.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.941
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door

38:07.985 --> 38:09.976
or your car window,

38:10.021 --> 38:12.319
and for some reason
you open your door,

38:12.356 --> 38:15.291
you roll down
your car window for me.

38:15.326 --> 38:17.521
So who am I?

38:17.561 --> 38:19.927
Someone I know.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.454
Maybe a nice set of tits.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.592
And the poems?
What about the poems?

38:23.634 --> 38:26.000
You have to compose the poem
before you got there, right?

38:26.037 --> 38:28.028
Otherwise what, you're gonna
blow out the guy's brains,

38:28.072 --> 38:29.937
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself?

38:29.974 --> 38:31.373
No prints on the poems,

38:31.409 --> 38:34.401
so probably
I wore gloves when I wrote it.

38:34.445 --> 38:37.505
You obviously know your victims.
Between that and the easy access,

38:37.548 --> 38:39.880
I guess that they know you too.
They must.

38:39.917 --> 38:42.351
These guys are all scumbags.
They're not gonna trust anyone,

38:42.386 --> 38:44.946
open the door for anyone,
especially if they don't know them.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.321
Yeah, but I more than know them.

38:47.358 --> 38:49.690
I know everything about them.
I know their moves,

38:49.727 --> 38:51.592
their patterns,
I know their schedules.

38:51.629 --> 38:54.427
Okay, so you're following them.
You're staking them out.

39:07.678 --> 39:10.272
Anyone gonna say it?

39:10.314 --> 39:12.248
What?

39:14.752 --> 39:17.414
Fuck me.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.955
- He's right, it's a cop.
- No.

39:20.991 --> 39:23.289
Let's slow down, fellows.
We're getting way ahead of ourselves.

39:23.327 --> 39:26.922
- Come on, it's a cop, you know it.
- I don't know shit. Neither do you.

39:26.964 --> 39:29.831
I'm telling your right now,
it's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

39:29.867 --> 39:31.562
What do you mean,
"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop"?

39:31.602 --> 39:34.867
- Where do you come off saying it's a cop?
- Easy, partner, he's just saying it.

39:34.905 --> 39:37.533
- What are you talking about?
- He's just saying...

39:37.575 --> 39:40.874
I know, I know, I know
what he's saying.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.309
And I'm saying it's bullshit.

39:45.316 --> 39:48.285
Shoot me. What the fuck?
But don't say it's a cop.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.621
# You cast a spell on me #

39:55.659 --> 39:58.219
# I was blind and now I see #

39:58.262 --> 40:01.254
# You work your magic,
that's the key #

40:01.298 --> 40:03.858
# You wave your wand #

40:03.901 --> 40:07.462
# And cast a spell on me... #

40:07.505 --> 40:09.496
So what about dinner?

40:09.540 --> 40:11.132
You feel like going out?

40:11.175 --> 40:12.972
Where?

40:13.010 --> 40:14.875
I don't care.
You're the one going.

40:14.912 --> 40:16.743
What is your problem?

40:16.781 --> 40:18.772
No problem.

40:18.816 --> 40:20.943
If you feel like hanging around,
be my guest.

40:20.985 --> 40:22.316
I don't feel like going out.

40:22.353 --> 40:25.516
Fine, just don't bug me.

40:25.556 --> 40:29.686
This is the best part of my day
and I don't need you fucking it up.

40:31.495 --> 40:34.487
So you only fuck cops?

40:34.532 --> 40:37.399
Once in a while
I do a fireman or an ex-con.

40:39.336 --> 40:40.997
You lump us in together?

40:41.038 --> 40:43.165
Well, I have some respect
for firemen.

40:43.207 --> 40:45.004
Fuck you.

40:45.042 --> 40:46.976
You know why they take away
your nightstick

40:47.011 --> 40:49.241
- when you hang up your uniform?
- No.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.475
They don't trust you with it.

40:51.515 --> 40:53.676
Right now I wouldn't trust
myself with it either.

40:53.717 --> 40:55.742
Shit, you'd probably love that.

40:55.786 --> 40:57.447
Too bad you never met
Van Luytens.

40:57.488 --> 40:59.183
You two really would have
hit it off great.

40:59.223 --> 41:01.384
At least somebody finally
brought some justice down

41:01.425 --> 41:03.256
on that dickless little fuck.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.592
Now that is who I'd like to meet.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.529
Well, maybe you'll get
your wish one day.

41:07.565 --> 41:09.396
They think it's a cop.

41:09.433 --> 41:11.060
- Makes sense.
- Bullshit.

41:11.101 --> 41:13.092
It's just some fucking psychopath.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.469
Well, there's plenty of those
on the job.

41:23.914 --> 41:25.472
- Are you sleeping well?
- Not really.

41:25.516 --> 41:27.040
- Yep.
- Eating well?

41:27.084 --> 41:28.551
- No.
- Yeah.

41:28.586 --> 41:29.780
Any recurring nightmares?

41:29.820 --> 41:32.311
Yeah, that I'm stuck
in a room with you forever.

41:33.524 --> 41:34.889
Nope.

41:34.925 --> 41:36.722
Do you think you're fit
to return to duty?

41:36.760 --> 41:38.751
- Abso-fucking-lutely.
- Yeah.

41:38.796 --> 41:41.924
- You ever think about retiring?
- You mean, death with benefits?

41:41.966 --> 41:43.763
What's not to like?

41:43.801 --> 41:45.769
- You ever think about retiring?
- Not really.

41:45.803 --> 41:47.794
What have I got to look forward to?

41:47.838 --> 41:50.033
Sailing my 26-footer
around Sheepshead Bay,

41:50.074 --> 41:51.507
umpiring cops' softball?

41:51.542 --> 41:53.635
- How about corporate security work?
- It's too dangerous.

41:53.677 --> 41:56.942
- So what are you gonna do?
- Maybe I'll buy a boat.

41:56.981 --> 41:59.073
All right, look,
I don't know if I believe this,

41:59.116 --> 42:00.879
but I'm just gonna
throw it out there.

42:00.918 --> 42:03.250
You guys say we're looking
for one of our own,

42:03.287 --> 42:07.246
but what if it was an ex-cop,
somebody with an axe to grind?

42:07.291 --> 42:08.952
You got one in mind?

42:08.993 --> 42:12.121
He's thinking about Martin Baum

42:12.162 --> 42:14.926
our old lieutenant.

42:14.965 --> 42:17.331
So what's the story with him?

42:17.368 --> 42:19.359
He got fired a few years ago.

42:19.403 --> 42:22.600
I'm not saying there's any motive,
but he knew all the victims.

42:22.640 --> 42:26.201
Yeah, but Turk,
I knew most of those guys.

42:26.243 --> 42:29.406
So did you, Riley, Perez.
Even Karen knew 'em.

42:29.446 --> 42:31.505
- I'm just throwing it out there.
- Well, maybe you killed 'em.

42:31.549 --> 42:34.848
Yeah, maybe I did.

42:34.885 --> 42:37.046
The poems and the placement
of the weapons

42:37.087 --> 42:38.884
are all we've got
linking the kills,

42:38.923 --> 42:41.619
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics.

42:41.659 --> 42:44.025
That shouldn't be
too much of a problem.

42:44.061 --> 42:46.052
We already got the girl
working on that.

42:46.096 --> 42:49.862
That's right, Karen's been
humping on it all week, as we speak.

42:49.900 --> 42:52.368
What did you say?

42:52.403 --> 42:53.665
Here we go again.

42:53.704 --> 42:55.467
- You should watch your mouth.
- Oh, yeah?

42:55.506 --> 42:57.974
He didn't mean anything by it.
Karen and him are ancient history.

42:58.008 --> 43:00.169
- College boy can't speak for himself?
- Yeah, I can speak for myself.

43:00.210 --> 43:02.007
Let me speak for myself...
fuck you, Turk.

43:02.046 --> 43:04.014
Mutt, I'm gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell.

43:04.048 --> 43:06.141
I'm not better than you.
You're not better than me, man.

43:06.183 --> 43:07.878
You put your balls
in your pocket.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.579
And you, fellow officers,

43:09.620 --> 43:13.818
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional, you know?

43:13.857 --> 43:16.883
Please. Are we gonna move on
here now?

43:16.927 --> 43:18.918
What are we doing?
Where were we?

43:18.963 --> 43:22.524
Talking about Martin Baum.
What's his story?

43:22.566 --> 43:25.057
Some guys under him
got caught taking money.

43:25.102 --> 43:27.366
Baum stood up for them,
tried to cover it up.

43:27.404 --> 43:29.804
He do time?

43:29.840 --> 43:32.673
Well, they pressed charges,
but he plead out and resigned.

43:32.710 --> 43:34.701
So what's his beef with you?

43:34.745 --> 43:36.576
I could have lied to protect him,
but I didn't.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.606
Okay, but if he's got a beef with you,
why not go after you?

43:39.650 --> 43:42.141
Why not kill you? Why go around
acting like a serial killer,

43:42.186 --> 43:44.051
killing all these degenerates?
It doesn't make any sense.

43:44.088 --> 43:46.522
- I'm just telling you.
- I'm telling you it doesn't make sense.

43:46.557 --> 43:48.616
I'm throwing it out there.
I'm saying this is what it is.

43:48.659 --> 43:50.752
You want to check him out or not?
I don't give a shit.

43:50.794 --> 43:53.319
- It doesn't make any sense.
- You're the ones that think it's a cop.

43:53.364 --> 43:55.298
I'm just saying here's a cop
with a chip on his shoulder.

43:55.332 --> 43:57.323
Check him out if you want.
I don't give a shit.

43:57.368 --> 44:00.701
Calm down and give a better reason
why Baum could be a suspect, okay?

44:02.539 --> 44:04.973
PMS, gotta be.

44:11.749 --> 44:14.650
- Hey, guys.
- What's going on?

44:14.685 --> 44:17.085
I came over to bring you
the FBI report

44:17.121 --> 44:19.089
on the paper
and handwriting.

44:19.123 --> 44:21.250
You don't have a problem
with me looking over the evidence

44:21.291 --> 44:23.725
that I collected and processed
for you, do you?

44:23.761 --> 44:25.661
- No problem.
- Put it back, Karen.

44:25.696 --> 44:27.687
- This is fascinating.
- Let's go, come on.

44:27.731 --> 44:29.699
Come on, let's go, let's go.

44:29.733 --> 44:31.530
- What?
- Come on, let's go.

44:31.568 --> 44:33.593
Get your hands off me.

44:33.637 --> 44:35.867
I'll give you a little privacy.
I don't want to interrupt anything here.

44:35.906 --> 44:37.703
Are you afraid of me
looking at your old case files?

44:37.741 --> 44:40.209
- Is that it?
- Okay, I'm gone. Enjoy.

44:40.244 --> 44:42.235
- What?
- What is it with you?

44:42.279 --> 44:44.304
What is it with you?

44:47.651 --> 44:51.109
I'm sorry about last night, okay?

44:51.155 --> 44:53.817
I really am. It's a habit.

44:53.857 --> 44:56.758
Habits can be broken, right?

44:56.794 --> 44:58.193
That's bullshit.

44:58.228 --> 44:59.490
No.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.998
I'm totally serious, all right?

45:03.467 --> 45:05.765
It's not bullshit,

45:05.803 --> 45:07.794
really.

45:14.478 --> 45:16.946
Why do you think
Turk was so quick to take the lead

45:16.980 --> 45:19.881
on the poetry case, huh?
To keep us from finding the killer, man.

45:19.917 --> 45:22.283
That's what I would do
if I was covering my tracks.

45:22.319 --> 45:25.254
He sticks us on this Baum stakeout
'cause it's more misdirection.

45:25.289 --> 45:26.449
Makes sense.

45:26.490 --> 45:28.685
I hate that Turk, man.

45:57.354 --> 45:59.345
Hey, he's coming out.
He's coming out.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.924
Oh, at 2:45 in the morning.

46:07.197 --> 46:10.655
Is it killing time
or is he just killing time?

46:30.287 --> 46:32.778
Come on, Baum,
go kill someone already.

46:32.823 --> 46:35.348
Yeah, kill Turk, man.
He's the one setting you up.

46:35.392 --> 46:36.859
Do us all a favor.

46:41.999 --> 46:44.490
Hey, did you see Turk's
marksmanship scores?

46:44.535 --> 46:46.093
Did you see this?
It's ridiculous.

46:46.136 --> 46:48.036
Service... 99,
70 out of 100.

46:48.071 --> 46:51.507
Combat Association awards,
department commendations.

46:51.542 --> 46:53.942
This guy could take out your left nut
at 50 yards.

46:57.214 --> 46:59.239
Did you see the computer
trajectories, man?

46:59.283 --> 47:00.716
Not one stray slug.

47:00.751 --> 47:03.083
Even Berkowitz put a couple
in the Corinthian leather.

47:08.225 --> 47:10.693
What about Karen?
She come up with anything new?

47:10.727 --> 47:12.592
No, not yet.

47:12.629 --> 47:14.597
If Baum kills somebody
I don't want us to be in the car

47:14.631 --> 47:16.997
waiting when it happens, okay?

47:18.836 --> 47:20.497
I'll go.

47:20.537 --> 47:22.528
Attaboy, Teddy, attaboy.

47:22.573 --> 47:23.938
I'm proud of you, son.

47:35.152 --> 47:37.313
You're Perez, right?

47:37.354 --> 47:38.685
Yeah.

47:38.722 --> 47:40.417
I'm Martin Baum.

47:44.027 --> 47:46.154
I got a permit for this.

47:46.196 --> 47:48.926
I work security
in the diamond district.

47:48.966 --> 47:51.764
So you figure it's a cop
doing the poetry killings?

47:51.802 --> 47:54.669
Someone says, "Check out Baum.
He thinks he got a raw deal."

47:54.705 --> 47:57.139
That's what passes
for police work these days?

47:57.174 --> 47:58.664
Do you think
you got a raw deal?

47:58.709 --> 48:00.574
Damn straight.

48:00.611 --> 48:02.943
- Life sucks.
- Yeah.

48:02.980 --> 48:05.540
- Everything okay, Simon?
- Teddy, where the fuck were you, man?

48:05.582 --> 48:07.880
Anything else you want to tell us,
Lieutenant Baum?

48:07.918 --> 48:11.820
- I got something for you in my pocket.
- Huh-uh!

48:13.357 --> 48:18.090
A passport, credit card receipts,
boarding passes.

48:18.128 --> 48:20.119
The day Brady was killed

48:20.163 --> 48:22.332
I was escorting a client
to Brazil.

48:26.670 --> 48:29.764
Judgment is
the dominion of the Lord.

48:29.806 --> 48:32.707
And if this person,
this worthless rapist

48:32.743 --> 48:35.268
or murderer,
as you describe him,

48:35.312 --> 48:38.713
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution,

48:38.749 --> 48:41.115
it must be granted to him.

48:41.151 --> 48:43.585
Your name doesn't ring a bell,

48:43.620 --> 48:47.886
but I've had so many
altar boys over the years.

48:51.995 --> 48:53.986
So many altar boys

48:54.031 --> 48:56.727
that it's hard to remember
their names.

48:56.767 --> 48:59.827
My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

48:59.870 --> 49:02.134
You may not
remember me now,

49:02.172 --> 49:05.335
but I guarantee you'll remember my name
for the rest of your life.

49:05.375 --> 49:09.243
Father Connell,
may he rot in hell.

49:09.279 --> 49:11.747
13 down, one to go.

49:20.190 --> 49:23.785
White underwear
below the knee.

49:23.827 --> 49:26.295
Briefs-style.

49:26.330 --> 49:28.764
Large tweezers.

49:28.799 --> 49:32.257
I am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased

49:32.302 --> 49:36.329
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag.

49:39.042 --> 49:42.773
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

49:44.448 --> 49:47.076
Hey. It's another one,

49:47.117 --> 49:49.312
handwritten.

49:52.589 --> 49:55.353
"The old man
who the children trust,

49:55.392 --> 49:59.021
Unable to control his lust,

49:59.062 --> 50:01.963
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

50:01.999 --> 50:06.060
The church can't stop him.
Someone must."

50:07.437 --> 50:09.428
I'll see what else I can find.

50:15.012 --> 50:17.276
What's the matter with you?

50:17.314 --> 50:19.612
Father Connell gave me
my first communion

50:19.649 --> 50:22.413
back in Bensonhurst.

50:24.788 --> 50:27.279
Hey, guys.
Sorry we didn't get a chance to call.

50:27.324 --> 50:30.384
- Yeah, I bet you are.
- Go over there, take a look around.

50:30.427 --> 50:32.554
We'll compare notes later, okay?

50:32.596 --> 50:35.724
Looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest,

50:35.766 --> 50:37.757
left him with his pants down.

50:37.801 --> 50:39.428
- Come on.
- No, look.

50:39.469 --> 50:40.936
Come on, don't talk like that.

50:40.971 --> 50:42.939
- Hey, look for yourself.
- Have a little respect.

50:44.474 --> 50:47.671
Next thing they're gonna tell us
Lieutenant Baum was an altar boy here.

50:47.711 --> 50:51.147
Tell me about it.
These two guys fucking stink.

50:51.181 --> 50:53.513
Look, Doctor,
you read the poems.

50:53.550 --> 50:55.780
It is possible, right,
that this guy is a cop?

50:55.819 --> 50:58.185
I've never seen it.

50:58.221 --> 51:01.019
I've never even heard
about a cop serial killer.

51:01.058 --> 51:03.219
Come on, girls,
let's go, let's go.

51:04.227 --> 51:08.186
Yeah. Go go go go go
go go go go!

51:08.231 --> 51:09.255
Safe.

51:09.299 --> 51:11.767
Doc, give us a tip.
How are we gonna catch this guy?

51:11.802 --> 51:13.793
You don't have to worry
about that.

51:13.837 --> 51:15.498
He wants to get caught.

51:17.808 --> 51:20.470
You don't have any better place
to have lunch?

51:20.510 --> 51:22.307
I wanted to thank you.

51:22.345 --> 51:24.074
What, about Spider?

51:24.114 --> 51:25.775
Yeah.

51:25.816 --> 51:28.410
And for looking in on me
at the hospital

51:28.452 --> 51:29.976
and the encouragement.

51:30.020 --> 51:31.317
Why would he want that?

51:31.354 --> 51:33.914
After a while
getting away with it isn't enough.

51:33.957 --> 51:35.948
So is your daughter
on the team?

51:35.992 --> 51:38.825
No, she used to play,
but now she's 25, living in California,

51:38.862 --> 51:41.558
five years sober
and working as a nurse.

51:41.598 --> 51:43.759
And her mother?

51:43.800 --> 51:45.825
Her mother died
when she was very young.

51:46.837 --> 51:49.772
He wants everybody to know
that he got away with it,

51:49.806 --> 51:53.833
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is.

51:53.877 --> 51:57.040
Most of these killings were criminals
in Rooster's and his beat, right?

51:57.080 --> 51:58.945
And then he all but threatens
to kill Van Luytens

51:58.982 --> 52:00.950
in front of hundreds of witnesses.
And then he sends us

52:00.984 --> 52:04.044
on this crazy wild goose chase
after Lieutenant Baum, didn't he?

52:04.087 --> 52:06.078
- Yes, he did.
- Why would he do that? Why?

52:06.123 --> 52:08.648
You gotta show me more than that.
So far you got shit.

52:08.692 --> 52:10.284
- Give him more, man.
- You want more?

52:10.327 --> 52:12.955
- How about the church records?
- The very ones that Turk was

52:12.996 --> 52:14.930
so diligently pursuing.
How about that?

52:14.965 --> 52:17.866
It turns out our most recent victim,
the late Father Connell,

52:17.901 --> 52:20.631
was moved all over the place...
eight parishes in 20 years.

52:20.670 --> 52:23.161
Why would they do that
with a Catholic priest? It's obvious.

52:23.206 --> 52:25.697
He's giving the children
more than communion behind the altar.

52:25.742 --> 52:28.176
Now Turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child.

52:28.211 --> 52:29.542
It's very plausible.

52:30.981 --> 52:34.144
This priest,
this Father Connell,

52:34.184 --> 52:35.879
he gave you your first
holy communion, eh?

52:35.919 --> 52:37.045
He did.

52:37.087 --> 52:40.318
Did he every try to do
anything inappropriate? I mean...

52:40.357 --> 52:42.348
I know what you mean.
No, never.

52:44.060 --> 52:46.051
Okay, fine.
Is there any reason

52:46.096 --> 52:48.326
why somebody out there
might think that he did?

52:48.365 --> 52:49.923
No.

52:49.966 --> 52:52.298
Am I a suspect here, Lieutenant?

52:53.336 --> 52:55.361
No,

52:55.405 --> 52:59.239
but these bodies
are starting to smell.

52:59.276 --> 53:01.870
A lot of it is drifting
in your direction.

53:01.912 --> 53:03.903
Drifting or being pushed?

53:03.947 --> 53:06.040
What can I say?

53:06.082 --> 53:08.516
You got connections
to most of these victims.

53:08.552 --> 53:11.487
You're not exactly
Mother Teresa.

53:12.789 --> 53:15.690
I never had any problem
with that priest.

53:15.725 --> 53:18.660
Okay. Okay, fine.

53:18.695 --> 53:21.425
That settles it.

53:27.571 --> 53:29.664
I had a talk with Riley and Perez.

53:29.706 --> 53:31.230
Good cops.

53:31.274 --> 53:33.742
Don't fuck around, okay?
Just listen.

53:33.777 --> 53:35.039
I'm listening.

53:35.078 --> 53:37.478
They think
Turk might be our guy.

53:41.384 --> 53:43.614
Oh, man. I gotta tell you,

53:43.653 --> 53:46.349
from where I'm sitting
that is so fucking funny.

53:46.389 --> 53:48.448
You can't take that seriously.

53:48.491 --> 53:51.460
Everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact

53:51.494 --> 53:54.054
- that we're chasing one of our own.
- But it ain't Turk.

53:54.097 --> 53:55.860
Sure as I'm sitting here
he ain't the guy.

53:55.899 --> 53:57.526
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

53:57.567 --> 54:00.035
- How do you know that?
- Because I know it.

54:00.070 --> 54:02.630
I know it to a moral certainty.

54:02.672 --> 54:04.139
Okay?

54:05.342 --> 54:07.333
This priest,

54:07.377 --> 54:09.971
this Father Connell...

54:10.013 --> 54:12.311
he was Turk's priest
when he was a kid.

54:12.349 --> 54:13.373
He told you that.

54:13.416 --> 54:15.714
He didn't tell me this priest
was a child molester.

54:15.752 --> 54:18.687
- I can't believe this bullshit.
- Believe it, all right?

54:18.722 --> 54:21.282
- Turk's a good guy.
- You understand?

54:21.324 --> 54:23.588
- He's the best cop you got.
- Don't you tell me what I gotta do.

54:23.627 --> 54:25.686
Don't you say a goddamn word
to him about this either,

54:25.729 --> 54:27.663
or you're finished.

54:37.607 --> 54:39.598
Can I speak now?

54:39.643 --> 54:41.440
Feel free.

54:42.445 --> 54:46.279
He cares.
You know what I'm saying?

54:46.316 --> 54:49.217
Turk cares about people.

54:50.553 --> 54:53.545
I know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes.

54:53.590 --> 54:56.184
It doesn't matter.

54:56.226 --> 54:58.490
He cares about protecting people.

54:58.528 --> 55:00.587
And if you don't back him,

55:00.630 --> 55:04.501
you will regret it.

55:25.722 --> 55:27.212
Jesus.

55:27.257 --> 55:28.986
Sorry.

55:29.025 --> 55:31.721
I just never rattled
anyone's cage before.

55:31.761 --> 55:34.821
- Got a minute?
- Yeah, what's up?

55:34.864 --> 55:38.265
You know me and Turk
are buddies, right?

55:38.301 --> 55:39.791
Of course.

55:39.836 --> 55:41.326
I'd do anything for him.

55:41.371 --> 55:43.771
He would do anything for you.

55:43.807 --> 55:45.035
Would you?

55:45.075 --> 55:46.599
Would I what?

55:46.643 --> 55:48.668
Would you do anything for him?

55:52.215 --> 55:54.012
I don't know...
where is this going?

55:54.050 --> 55:56.075
He wants you
to have sex with me.

55:58.221 --> 56:00.121
Really?

56:02.025 --> 56:03.856
He wouldn't mind.

56:03.893 --> 56:06.589
But that's not why I'm here.

56:06.629 --> 56:09.291
Okay, why are you here?

56:09.332 --> 56:12.563
Where were you
the night Rambo was killed

56:12.602 --> 56:15.571
and Trager?
Got an alibi for those nights?

56:17.073 --> 56:20.304
I mean, did you know either one
those guys before they were murdered?

56:20.343 --> 56:23.312
Makes you uncomfortable
when I talk like that.

56:23.346 --> 56:26.144
You look like you're guilty.
You're not guilty.

56:26.182 --> 56:28.275
I know that.
You didn't kill those guys, did you?

56:31.955 --> 56:34.981
Now you know what Turk feels.

56:39.028 --> 56:42.759
I need you to get me
some information

56:42.799 --> 56:44.824
discreetly.

56:46.469 --> 56:47.902
Can you do that for me?

56:47.937 --> 56:50.201
You got it.

56:50.240 --> 56:51.901
Absolutely.

56:51.941 --> 56:53.932
Let's solve these fucking murders.

56:58.314 --> 56:59.679
Oh.

56:59.716 --> 57:01.809
- Hey, boy genius.
- Perfect timing, buddy.

57:01.851 --> 57:03.876
Listen, you really worked
on Hingis, didn't you?

57:03.920 --> 57:05.615
He was all worked up
about my partner.

57:05.655 --> 57:07.555
Good. He should be.

57:07.590 --> 57:10.150
I think we should sit down,
see if we can square things, okay?

57:10.193 --> 57:13.390
All right. Want to meet at Montrose
at 8:00 PM?

57:13.430 --> 57:16.729
Could you make that 9:00?
I gotta meet an old friend.

57:16.766 --> 57:18.393
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.

57:20.937 --> 57:24.236
#Baby's got issues #

57:24.274 --> 57:27.732
# Baby's got pains... #

57:27.777 --> 57:29.768
- Hey, fellows.
- Hey.

57:29.813 --> 57:32.976
Thanks for coming.

57:33.016 --> 57:35.644
- This here is Cheryl Brooks.
- Hello, Cheryl Brooks.

57:35.685 --> 57:37.676
Cheryl's got something to tell you.

57:38.855 --> 57:42.484
My daughter Lynn

57:42.525 --> 57:45.050
died four years ago.

57:45.094 --> 57:48.029
She was 10 years old.
She was raped and she was murdered.

57:50.133 --> 57:54.263
The guy I was living with,
Charles...

57:54.304 --> 57:55.464
Charles Randall.

57:55.505 --> 57:58.599
Yeah, Charles Randall... he did it.

57:58.641 --> 58:01.439
Why are you telling us this?

58:01.478 --> 58:04.606
Because he got off for that.
He was acquitted at trial.

58:04.647 --> 58:06.877
- Because?
- Because?

58:08.651 --> 58:10.949
I testified for him.

58:10.987 --> 58:13.820
- You did what?
- I said he was with me.

58:15.391 --> 58:19.088
You see, Cheryl here is
a very forgiving person,

58:19.128 --> 58:21.426
unlike us hard-asses.

58:21.464 --> 58:23.728
- He threatened to kill me.
- Okay, Cheryl.

58:23.766 --> 58:27.224
Now you say goodbye
to the nice officers

58:27.270 --> 58:31.104
and you go on back home.

58:31.140 --> 58:33.938
Don't drink yourself to death.

58:36.045 --> 58:38.570
Okay, so...

58:38.615 --> 58:40.981
eh?

58:43.887 --> 58:46.617
I want to hear you say it.

58:46.656 --> 58:49.250
Come on, say it.

58:53.696 --> 58:57.689
We planted the gun
in Randall's apartment, okay?

58:57.734 --> 59:00.066
I said it. Happy?

59:00.103 --> 59:01.695
- Thank you.
- Yes, I am.

59:01.738 --> 59:04.502
I'd do it again if I had to
'cause that fucking maggot

59:04.541 --> 59:08.341
could rot away for all eternity.
I'd sleep just fine.

59:08.378 --> 59:09.777
So what do you want from us?

59:09.812 --> 59:12.303
You guys think
my partner's a serial killer.

59:12.348 --> 59:14.145
You're way off.

59:14.183 --> 59:17.243
You like Turk for this thing?
Go have your fun.

59:17.287 --> 59:19.687
I'll go along with you.

59:19.722 --> 59:22.282
I'll even help you.

59:22.325 --> 59:25.988
But do not drag up Chuck Randall
and that fucking gun,

59:26.029 --> 59:29.465
because if he walks out of jail
he's gonna end up dead.

59:29.499 --> 59:31.558
Excuse me?

59:33.136 --> 59:36.572
I'll put two
through his fucking head

59:36.606 --> 59:39.166
myself.

59:39.208 --> 59:41.472
Done deal.

59:54.524 --> 59:57.459
My grandmother loved opera.

59:57.493 --> 59:59.518
She supported us by sewing.

59:59.562 --> 01:00:02.656
I used to thread needles
for my grandmother.

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.997
- Gave all her money to church.
- You admired her?

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:07.161
I worshipped her.

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:10.001
Rooster? Yeah, he's religious,
goes to church.

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:11.734
How about you?

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:15.369
Our job is keeping
99% of the population safe

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:18.847
from the other 1%.

01:00:18.881 --> 01:00:22.476
The problem is that we have to
spend half our lives with that 1%.

01:00:22.518 --> 01:00:24.315
And the better we do that job,

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:26.914
the less the other 99% think
they need us.

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:29.584
They're clueless.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.560
The only ones paying attention
on the street

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:33.994
are the cops and the criminals.
Everyone else is just

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:36.794
going somewhere
or shopping.

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:44.633
- Out.
- Come on.

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:47.165
I got an order here placing you
on restricted duty.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:49.701
Now in plain English that means
you'll work at your desk.

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:51.805
You might want to cooperate
with the shrink

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:54.612
next time you two meet,
and you will meet again.

01:00:58.554 --> 01:01:01.489
Cool my fucking heels.
Cool my fucking heels, huh?

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:04.254
I'm gonna blow a fucking hole
in that motherfucker Perez

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:07.160
and blow right through his head
for putting me through this bullshit.

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:09.096
- Turk.
- Fuck, I'm gonna...

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:10.429
kill that motherfucker.

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:13.264
Calm down. What the hell is it?
You're making all the wrong moves.

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:15.133
What are you talking about?
This ain't a chess game, partner.

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:17.605
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You go at Perez now...

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.131
you know what's gonna happen?
You're gonna walk right into a trap.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:22.337
You are.
They're just waiting for you.

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:24.073
Fucking Hingis.

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:26.377
Fucking Hingis believes him.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:29.408
He actually fucking believes
that motherfucking Perez.

01:01:29.452 --> 01:01:30.942
Stay back. Wait.

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:34.423
Wait for the right time,
then fire away.

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:36.322
Not now. Now is not the right time.

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.657
Believe me.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.027
You believe me?
Now is not the time.

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:42.156
Uh-huh.

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:44.325
- Please.
- Yeah.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:48.133
Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight.
My class ran late.

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:50.571
But I'll see you
tomorrow, all right?

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:53.507
And I'm sorry about what happened
with you and Lieutenant Hingis today.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.670
It's gonna be fine.
It'll blow over.

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:58.647
People are just... everyone's crazy.
People are overreacting.

01:01:58.681 --> 01:02:01.343
All right? Good night.

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.751
It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop.

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:21.301
What you got for me, good-looking?

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:29.569
Mark my words, there's a reason
Perez is gunning for me.

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:32.342
Perez is too smart to be that stupid.

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:35.009
For one thing, all that college-boy crap...
that's bullshit.

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:37.281
He did one year at SUNY,
only one year.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.309
No kidding.

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.754
They threw him out...
disruptive influence.

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:43.486
And I hear from the 240 he mixed it up bad
with a captain over there.

01:02:43.526 --> 01:02:45.756
The guy is a total
fucking asshole.

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:47.626
BMW 3 series,

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:49.995
Mercedes CLK... too light.

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:53.001
BMW 7 series...
the biggest engine.

01:02:53.035 --> 01:02:55.697
That's what you have to get.
If they shoot at you,

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:58.536
you still want
to get the fuck out of there...

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.107
Bentley... very good

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:04.909
because can fuck two prostitutes
in back seat

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:08.678
and mount flame-thrower
on the hood. Da?

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:10.049
Da.

01:03:10.086 --> 01:03:12.418
- What about a Cadillac?
- Come on,

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.947
the fucking car can't turn
fucking corner. Are you kidding me?

01:03:15.992 --> 01:03:17.823
You know either one of those
Neanderthals?

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.624
The wop is Joe Scianci from Bensonhurst.
He's a mid-level guy.

01:03:20.663 --> 01:03:22.597
What about Ivan?

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.463
Russian guy,
Yevgeny Magulat,

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:28.630
an enforcer for the Italians,
works with Gambinos a lot.

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:35.737
That shit's getting to me.

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.803
I know it's getting to you.

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.983
Shit gets to me too, you know,

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:45.112
but I take it in, I let it out
on my own terms.

01:03:46.722 --> 01:03:48.781
I bet you didn't write
one word down

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.725
in that little notebook
Prosky gave us.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.320
Of course not. Did you?

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:55.694
Yeah, it's great.

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:59.632
It helps me put things in perspective.

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:03.662
You know what I'm saying?
Write it down, get it out.

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:06.231
- You should try this.
- Let's have a look.

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:08.903
What, are you kidding me?
Oh, come on, come on.

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:11.413
This belongs to me... private.

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:15.816
- You don't want to let me see?
- Close to my heart. No, sir.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.047
I just got sick
of the whole fucking game...

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:20.555
run around looking for clues,
making arrests,

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:23.115
write reports, testify, cut deals.

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:26.060
It was all just so much
fucking bullshit.

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:30.125
Detective...

01:04:35.872 --> 01:04:37.271
Then it all got real simple.

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:40.332
Yeah, Detective Perez here.
Hey, brother, what's up?

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:43.311
I hate scumbags. I like shooting people.
What was I giving up?

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:46.338
Hey, look, I set the meeting up
with Rooster first thing tomorrow.

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:49.783
Come on, you gotta be fast, man.
I don't want Turk getting wind of anything.

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:52.185
A retirement party and a gold watch?

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:55.019
A handshake from the mayor
and my name on some fucking plaque?

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.458
Big fucking deal.

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:05.724
It's better this way.

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:10.369
Now everybody knows
who I was and where I stood.

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:55.840
Hey, it's me.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.778
Listen, I think somebody
followed me here... home.

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:03.291
He's outside right now.

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:07.023
Can you come over or...?

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:10.123
Just call me back, okay?
All right.

01:06:40.296 --> 01:06:42.662
Don't move.

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:58.570
- Come on, open up.
- Turk?

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:05.980
I just called you.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.614
Put the gun down.

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:09.647
There's a car following me.

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:12.456
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:17.855
Have you got
something to tell me?

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:19.697
About what?

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:22.295
Trager, Randall.

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:24.329
Did you sneak
into my apartment?

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.364
What are they doing
on your computer?

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:28.639
I was checking
all the links in the case.

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:33.676
Are you hiding something
from me?

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:38.477
Huh?

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:42.856
I just received this... this poem.

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:45.486
A poem?
Not worth mentioning, huh?

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:48.053
The handwriting
doesn't even match.

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:50.292
It's a fake.

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:52.323
Did you write it?

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:56.730
Did you write it?

01:08:00.943 --> 01:08:03.503
What the hell is going on here?

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:05.707
You're spending a lot of time
with Perez, aren't you?

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.613
Yeah, I've been working the case.

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:09.811
What, are you jealous?

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:12.616
Can I trust you?

01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:17.487
- Yes.
- Okay.

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:19.960
Get me anything and everything
that you can find out

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:22.429
about Perez or Riley,
what they know about me.

01:08:24.166 --> 01:08:25.997
Everything.

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:28.502
Karen, don't play me.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:33.435
I am leaning much further
into saying that it is a cop.

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:36.809
Tell you what... I'm moving
past the leaning stage

01:08:36.845 --> 01:08:39.644
and I'm moving towards the
l-know-for-sure-it's-a-fucking-cop stage,

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:42.014
considering how expertly
he shot the shit out of my house.

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:44.314
Oh my God.
Are you hurt?

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:46.446
Am I hurt? Am I hurt?
He wants to know if I'm hurt.

01:08:46.488 --> 01:08:48.587
Actually, he's dead.

01:08:50.725 --> 01:08:54.059
- His name is Magulat.
- The guy we saw at Salerno's.

01:08:54.095 --> 01:08:57.156
Yeah, he's in intensive care
at St. Luke's.

01:08:57.198 --> 01:08:59.189
They think he's the guy

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:01.703
- chopped off Yakov Pearlstein's head.
- What do you think?

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:03.966
You think he's a victim,
or could he be our suspect?

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:07.032
I don't know, but either way
I think it's gonna be fun.

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:10.978
Doctor, what's the story?

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:14.005
He's one of the toughest human beings
I've ever come into contact with.

01:09:14.049 --> 01:09:15.812
We took six bullets
out of him.

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:17.716
Six? Whoo!

01:09:17.752 --> 01:09:20.517
Three from the night he was wounded,
three from previous shootings.

01:09:20.555 --> 01:09:22.456
The man is a tank.

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:24.550
Do you mind if I talk to him
a little bit?

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:27.220
His jaw's wired shut,
but go ahead.

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:30.163
That's okay. I'll ask the questions.
He can just grunt.

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:33.134
Hey, Yevgeny.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:35.399
Wake up.

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:40.136
That's it. Wake up,
you big fucking grizzly bear.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:42.576
You don't speak Russian?

01:09:42.611 --> 01:09:46.206
Swoboda. Swoboda. Swoboda.

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:48.738
Ron.

01:09:53.555 --> 01:09:56.787
I'm thinking this Russian killing machine
could be our first eyewitness.

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:02.429
Wake up, gugumuck.
You can tell us who did this to you.

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:10.105
Detective, I think that's enough.

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:13.597
Then you could tell us where you put
Yakov Pearlstein's head.

01:10:17.012 --> 01:10:19.913
4-3, 4-3, I need a round-the-clock
security detail

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:24.215
on a patient Magulat,
M-A-gulat,

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:26.448
St. Luke's in the ICU.

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:32.158
# I wake up in the morning... #

01:10:32.194 --> 01:10:35.459
Is this the number to call
to report a case of police brutality?

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:38.955
- Cat got your tongue?
- Out on bail again?

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:41.265
What, you think you can scare me,
little bitch? What do you want?

01:10:41.303 --> 01:10:43.635
Be careful, Detective.
My taxes pay your salary.

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:46.266
You don't pay any fucking taxes,
you lowlife piece of shit.

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:48.674
- Get to the point, come on.
- One of your vics, Trager,

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:51.339
stole a whole lot of guns
down South.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.473
Same guns are turning up
on your murder scenes.

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:54.812
So it's simple...

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:57.375
find stolen guns,
you got your guy.

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:59.250
So you know the guy?

01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:02.086
Do you know if there's a cop out there
who might be a danger to the public?

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:04.888
I couldn't live with myself
if I just stood by and didn't say anything.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:07.919
Look, I'm gonna give you
two seconds more. Give me yes or no.

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:10.898
Do you know the guy?
And when do I meet you to talk about it?

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:13.663
Friday, 9:00 PM, at my club.

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:14.862
I'll be there.

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:16.928
Man, there's dumb
and there's dumber,

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:19.440
but this is the motherfucking dumbest
right here, man.

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:21.636
Easy, son, easy.
It's gonna be easy for you.

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:25.272
All you gotta do is be bait, that's all.
Be a little sardine for us, all right?

01:11:25.314 --> 01:11:27.976
You help us... we got you covered.
Your club doesn't get hassled

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:30.542
and you don't have a revolving door
in and out of jail.

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:32.178
Do we have a deal or not?

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:35.622
Yeah, but your boy come in here
and go Hannibal Lecter on my ass,

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:38.183
I don't want no Jodie fucking Foster
coming through the door.

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.058
I want the goddamn
Marine Corps, man.

01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:43.724
# Since Color Me Badd was singing
"I wanna sex you up"...#

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:14.251
Evening, Detective.

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:17.513
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

01:12:17.548 --> 01:12:20.730
As soon as I heard
the fucking Russian didn't die

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:23.033
I knew things would never
be the same.

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:25.233
I had to change the rules,

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:27.265
the strategy.

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:31.075
I had to be bold, do something
that could never be undone.

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:41.223
I went for the unforgivable.

01:13:08.317 --> 01:13:11.013
No. Please. No.

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:35.908
Did you hear
anything I just said?

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:40.810
How exactly could I be
blowing this out of proportion?

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:43.010
That psycho just assaulted me.

01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:46.350
I am telling you
he is a classic sociopath.

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:48.515
Okay okay,
I'll look into it, all right?

01:13:48.557 --> 01:13:50.047
I'll look into it.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:52.253
You stay the hell away from here.
Understood?

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:54.091
Understood?

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:57.496
Fuck that.

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:11.209
Check the ball,
check the ball.

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.329
I got the ball. I got the ball.
I got the ball.

01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:15.945
Stay on him.
Stay on him.

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:17.918
Excuse me,
I'm Detective Corelli.

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:20.888
- I need to see your reservation book.
- Sure. Help yourself.

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.560
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:32.294
Yes, this is Detective Corelli.

01:14:32.334 --> 01:14:34.768
I've been trying to reach
Detectives Perez and Riley

01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:36.737
and I can't seem
to locate them.

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:39.764
- I like to party.
- That's nothing. I was into Kiss.

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:41.799
I used to run
around the house

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.971
with my tongue hanging out,
spitting fake blood.

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.309
I need to speak to them
urgently.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:52.552
Yes, I understand,
but I need the location, please.

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:23.607
Hey, he's here.

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:24.846
Let me in.

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:32.622
Thank God it's the police.

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:34.993
Yeah, so where do we go?

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.964
Follow me.

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:39.297
I used to play ball
a couple of blocks from here.

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:40.562
Get the fuck out of here.

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:43.537
When I was a kid I wasn't afraid
to mix it up with guys like you.

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:44.869
You still ain't.

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:47.432
Yeah, nowadays
I carry a gun with me.

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:50.741
It's a bad neighborhood.

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:52.770
- It ain't bad for me.
- Yeah, well...

01:15:52.814 --> 01:15:55.214
Yeah, he's inside.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:56.808
Well, so far so good.

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:59.446
So now that we're done with
the pleasantries, what do you got for me?

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:00.716
He's talking.

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:02.747
- What did you think he was gonna do?
- How about an apology?

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:05.555
The shit that happened to Stubby,
that wasn't supposed to happen.

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:07.357
Lieutenant,
that's a crock of shit.

01:16:07.358 --> 01:16:09.121
I lost three fucking teeth that day.

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:11.428
He's not a civilian.
He's a fucking dealer.

01:16:11.466 --> 01:16:13.525
- And I kept my mouth shut.
- So what?

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:16.868
You guys love those stupid gold teeth.
You should thank me.

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:19.738
Well, he's wearing a vest
and Starsky and Hutch here

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:22.801
are watching him like a couple
of hawks... gay hawks.

01:16:22.844 --> 01:16:26.007
Yeah, right there, buddy.

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:29.017
All right, enough bullshit.
So you know our poetry boy?

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:31.042
Just talk to me.
What do you got for me?

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:33.145
- All right, here we go.
- Here we go.

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:34.655
Would you please?

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:37.523
Just 'cause the guy's talking tough,
that don't mean shit.

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:39.356
Let me ask you something,
Copernicus.

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:41.988
That gun on his belt...
do you think it's a service pistol?

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:44.692
I bet you we'll trace it back to Trager's.
What do you think about that?

01:16:44.733 --> 01:16:46.462
- What do you want to bet?
- 500 bucks.

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:48.628
- You're on.
- I'm in for another five.

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:51.036
Oh, this is fun.

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:53.268
Look, I help you,
you reciprocate.

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:54.775
So help me.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:57.108
All right, you might see
a little bit of a cell-phone video.

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:59.204
I got it in front of Trager's
the night he bought it.

01:16:59.247 --> 01:17:01.181
- You got what?
- I got a movie...

01:17:01.216 --> 01:17:04.708
a couple of kids back from the prom,
preserving their special memories,

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:06.448
a positive ID of you, big time.

01:17:06.488 --> 01:17:08.649
- Oh, yeah? Of me?
- Yeah.

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:10.419
Okay.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:11.983
Now you know
what I'm talking about.

01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:14.393
Yeah, now I got it.

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:16.363
Yeah, well,
so how do I look?

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:20.992
Like a poet?

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:23.665
'Cause that's what I am,
you know, a poet.

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:26.401
All right, come on, let's go.

01:17:26.441 --> 01:17:29.069
In fact, I wrote a poem for you, Spider.
Want to hear it?

01:17:29.111 --> 01:17:31.045
Eh?

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:38.408
Drop your gun right now, motherfucker!
Drop to the ground right now!

01:17:38.453 --> 01:17:40.284
Oh! Oh! Grease me up and...

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:42.381
I mean, do they actually pay
you two morons?

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:45.689
- Put the fucking weapon on the ground.
- Gladly. Gladly. Right there.

01:17:45.727 --> 01:17:47.695
Right there. There you go.

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:50.764
Hey, you want to read my poem?

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.232
Easy easy.

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:53.564
Here, read it.

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:58.001
"You tried to set me up, you fucks,

01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.837
And this is how you do it?

01:17:59.875 --> 01:18:02.605
You thought I'd get
my dick cut off,

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:05.204
Instead you only blew it."

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:07.272
Great stuff.

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:09.681
- What is that shit?
- Thank you.

01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:12.152
That is poetry.

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:13.916
What are you doing here?

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:15.786
Well, don't look at me, partner,

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:18.315
but I tagged along
to protect your ass

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.693
and to see the look on their faces.
It was worth it.

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:24.096
We're doing our jobs here, okay?
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

01:18:24.132 --> 01:18:26.760
I never want you to apologize, Teddy.
There's a killer out there with a badge.

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:28.963
- What are you morons doing about it?
- What do you think we're doing here?

01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:30.869
- That's not it.
- No, that's not it.

01:18:30.906 --> 01:18:32.806
I just made 1000 bucks.

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:34.706
Where's the other gun?
Give it to me.

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:36.540
Why don't you frisk me, Sherlock?
Go ahead.

01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:38.773
- Frisk me, go ahead. Go ahead.
- Yeah, I'm gonna frisk you.

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.512
Ooh, nice touch, Mary.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:46.714
What are you doing after work?
Unless you're committed.

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.985
I don't want to get
in the middle of anything.

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:50.639
What happened to your face?

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.255
Your mick friend give
you a little love bite?

01:18:52.294 --> 01:18:55.661
- Shut the fuck up. Shut your fucking face.
- Hey hey hey! Whoa!

01:18:55.697 --> 01:18:58.427
I'll blow your brains out
if you don't get the fuck away.

01:18:58.467 --> 01:19:00.628
What's he talking about?

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:02.466
- What's he talking about?
- What he's talking about is,

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:04.836
just 'cause you didn't go for this
doesn't mean you're not our guy.

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:07.239
- Now we gotta break this shit up.
- Don't translate for me, man.

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:09.903
Will you let this go?
You fucked up, okay?

01:19:09.945 --> 01:19:12.470
- We fucked up 'cause you helped him.
- I'm gonna nail your ass.

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:14.880
I'm not through with you, man.
Make a mistake.

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:16.907
I'm gonna
break this stuff down, okay?

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:19.182
You fucking dog.

01:19:20.722 --> 01:19:23.486
Relax, Spider.

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:25.857
Come on, let's have a drink.

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:29.455
I saw what I think
is a refrigerator here.

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:35.329
I'll be back in a second.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:45.769
Hey, muffinhead.

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:50.451
Is this the person
who shot you?

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:53.387
You're sure?

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:01.152
No, you're the pumpkinhead.

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:14.375
You miss me?

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:18.743
"...of death and pain,

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.941
Place oneself among the slain.

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:23.507
If one addiction goes unfed,

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:25.850
The world is better with him dead."

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:45.667
Take it easy.

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:47.470
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.739
Jesus Christ, Rooster.

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:52.645
Just move into the room. Here.

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:55.149
Sit down. Sit down.

01:20:58.053 --> 01:21:00.044
Okay.

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:03.785
You gotta know about this,
Tom, from me.

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:06.919
Now just open that little book,
start reading.

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:09.430
Everything you want to know
is in there.

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:13.457
So go ahead.

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:17.027
Out loud.

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:20.466
For the record.

01:21:20.508 --> 01:21:23.272
See the little video here?

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:33.051
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade.

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:37.149
I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:41.787
- Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave.
- Tom,

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:44.924
we've got a lot to cover
and not much time to do it in, so...

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:51.400
"My name is David Fisk,
Detective First Grade."

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:53.964
My name is David Fisk.

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:57.035
"I've been a cop in the NYPD
for nearly 30 years."

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:59.945
I don't expect you
to remember me.

01:21:59.981 --> 01:22:02.006
I mean, it's been a long time

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:05.850
since you sat me on your lap
and told me you loved me.

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:08.947
"In that time

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:11.720
I've killed 14 people."

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:14.818
But I guarantee

01:22:14.863 --> 01:22:18.026
you're gonna remember the name
for the rest of your life.

01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:32.138
"You don't become a cop
because you want to serve and protect.

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:36.641
You join the force because they let you
carry a gun and a badge.

01:22:36.685 --> 01:22:39.347
Most people respect the badge.

01:22:39.387 --> 01:22:41.480
Everybody respects the gun."

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:44.356
I'm the killer.
I show up at your door.

01:22:44.392 --> 01:22:47.225
What are you talking about?
It's not a fucking chess game.

01:22:47.262 --> 01:22:50.356
Who knows? Maybe it is.
You're making all the wrong moves.

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:52.593
I'm gonna put two
through his fucking head

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.966
myself.

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:57.164
I know it to a moral certainty.

01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:59.730
You sort of get numb to it.

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:12.014
"Tom Cowen was my role model.

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:24.395
The day I stopped trying to be him

01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:26.764
was the greatest day of my life.

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:34.104
Several years back I framed
a lowlife child killer

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:36.804
named Charles Randall.

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.980
I should have known
it would come back to haunt me."

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:47.552
What do you want me
to do with this?

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:51.791
Is that all you got to say?

01:23:51.826 --> 01:23:54.056
I owe you this explanation, pal.

01:23:54.095 --> 01:23:56.120
Why are you telling me now?

01:23:56.164 --> 01:24:00.498
Ivan the Terrible
is gonna wake up pretty soon

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:02.332
and he's gonna ID me.

01:24:07.909 --> 01:24:09.740
Evening, Detective.

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:12.747
You want one? It's shit,
but it's better than nothing, right?

01:24:12.781 --> 01:24:16.945
I can just walk right in here.
Your partner's asleep. Step outside.

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:19.818
Did I ever pick
the wrong fucking Russki to shoot?

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:31.597
Now we're going off the record.

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:37.935
Uh, I'm going to take the rap
for the Randall gun thing.

01:24:37.972 --> 01:24:39.803
You saw that.

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:43.004
I mean, considering
the circumstances, why not?

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:45.512
No need to thank me.

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:48.648
That business about not being me...

01:24:48.683 --> 01:24:50.173
Yeah.

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:52.186
I don't get that.

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:56.213
Well, you're a great cop, Tom.

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:58.248
I mean, you were the one

01:24:58.293 --> 01:25:01.353
I aspired to all my life
and could never be.

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:05.331
Then you broke the law,

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:08.529
planted the gun on Randall,

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:11.835
let me down.

01:25:13.575 --> 01:25:15.509
I lost my faith.

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:21.037
That's when it all started.

01:25:21.082 --> 01:25:23.744
And once it did,

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.810
I couldn't stop.

01:25:27.188 --> 01:25:30.885
Finally,

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:33.416
I didn't want to.

01:25:39.834 --> 01:25:43.395
So I did my own thing.

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:46.032
And you know what? In the end

01:25:46.074 --> 01:25:48.372
it got done.

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:50.934
The scum went down.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.844
And that's it. That's that.

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:56.680
I don't understand
a word you said,

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:58.879
- don't understand any of it.
- I know you don't, Tom.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:01.616
As soon as I heard
the Russian didn't die

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:04.022
I knew I had to change the rules,

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:06.891
do something that could
never be undone.

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:08.987
I went for the unforgivable.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.224
No.

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:17.967
So what am I gonna do, my friend,

01:26:18.006 --> 01:26:20.634
partner? Arrest you?

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:23.542
At some point I gotta call it in.

01:26:23.578 --> 01:26:24.977
We're a team.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:26.708
We were.

01:26:26.748 --> 01:26:28.739
Yeah, we were, a great team.

01:26:28.783 --> 01:26:31.274
That was yesterday, Dave.

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:32.445
Today...

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:37.525
today you're pointing a gun at me.

01:26:41.963 --> 01:26:45.091
But it hasn't gone off yet.

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:51.961
Bye, Tom.

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:54.099
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

01:26:54.142 --> 01:26:57.145
To hell, I suppose.

01:27:43.825 --> 01:27:45.850
- Hey, Dave, Dave.
- Whoa.

01:27:45.893 --> 01:27:48.453
Don't come closer!

01:27:48.496 --> 01:27:50.828
- You wouldn't.
- You want to bet your life on it?

01:27:50.865 --> 01:27:52.833
Come on, partner, I know you.
You wouldn't.

01:27:52.867 --> 01:27:55.233
But I would.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.498
Oh.

01:27:56.537 --> 01:27:58.528
Karen, just take it easy.

01:27:58.573 --> 01:28:00.598
- Can't get me out of your mind?
- Shut up, Dave.

01:28:00.642 --> 01:28:04.669
You're gonna defend
this lowlife piece of shit?

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:07.647
- Boy, I'm in your head.
- I'm not defending him. Take it easy.

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:10.845
Fuck you, Turk.
Put the gun down, Fisk.

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:12.352
- And if I don't?
- Dave.

01:28:12.387 --> 01:28:15.151
- How about I blow your brains out?
- Ooh, I like the sound of that.

01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:17.123
- Don't move.
- Karen.

01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:19.558
You blow me away, Turk dies.
Is that your idea?

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:20.925
I said don't move, you prick.

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:23.260
Bye-bye!

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:26.524
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.

01:28:28.202 --> 01:28:29.897
Stay here.

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:38.077
Oh, man.

01:28:39.414 --> 01:28:40.676
Fuck.

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:44.116
These old locks...

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:45.847
I mean, they're good.

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:47.855
Dave, you've got to end
this thing.

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:49.948
End it?

01:28:49.991 --> 01:28:51.288
Put the gun down.

01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:54.124
What's your plan?

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:56.460
Are you gonna arrest me?

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:59.330
Are you gonna take me down
to the precinct, book me,

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:03.030
fingerprint me,
body-cavity-search me?

01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:04.936
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

01:29:04.972 --> 01:29:07.907
wheel me out on the "Geraldo" show,
a freak of the week?

01:29:07.942 --> 01:29:12.641
Or better yet, an in-depth
psycho profile on "Oprah"?

01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.978
Are you ready for that?
It ain't gonna fly, man.

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:17.382
Dave, you give me no choice.

01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:19.249
You got a choice... I escape.

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:23.086
Would you do that for me, Tom?

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.420
Would you let me escape?

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:26.984
Come on, don't do this.

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:29.360
I'm gonna make a run for it.

01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:31.592
What do you think?

01:29:31.632 --> 01:29:34.624
You gotta do the right thing.

01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:42.700
That's a 10-10, partner...

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:46.111
shots fired, suspect fleeing.
Let's go!

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:47.774
Come on, don't go there.

01:29:49.283 --> 01:29:52.343
Hey, partner, come on.
Shots fired.

01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:54.821
- Don't do this.
- Suspect fleeing,

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:57.290
resisting arrest. Come on.

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:09.602
A righteous man

01:30:09.637 --> 01:30:12.367
Before me stands,

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:16.776
A hero in these filthy lands.

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:20.212
A brother in arms,

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:23.706
In heart are you.

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:26.413
I was really hoping

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:29.116
You'd get it too.

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:35.153
- I do get it.
- No, you don't.

01:30:35.196 --> 01:30:37.130
No, I get it.

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:46.736
You know, the only thing
in this life

01:30:46.774 --> 01:30:49.607
that ever gave me
any satisfaction

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:51.544
was killing those fucks.

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:55.813
So this is for real.

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:58.216
I mean,

01:30:58.252 --> 01:31:00.584
this one is bad.

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:04.384
10-13.

01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:07.588
Officer down.

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:34.279
I ain't going anywhere, Tom.

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.620
I ain't going anywhere.

01:31:37.758 --> 01:31:40.591
It's okay.

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.630
3-4 squad, Central.
3-4 squad, Central.

01:31:48.669 --> 01:31:51.160
10-13, officer down.
184th and St. Nick's.

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:53.935
Officer down, 10-13.
Hurry hurry hurry.

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:56.637
- 10-4, 4 squad...
- Tom, don't. Don't.

01:31:56.677 --> 01:32:00.238
- Officer down. ETA six minutes.
- Don't.

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:02.909
Don't.

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:17.154
Don't.

01:32:25.606 --> 01:32:27.699
3-4 squad, Central.

01:32:27.742 --> 01:32:30.336
Central.
Go ahead, 4 squad.

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.903
That's a 10-55 on the bus.
Cancel the ambulance.

01:32:32.947 --> 01:32:34.938
10-5?

01:32:34.982 --> 01:32:38.042
Cancel the ambulance.
10-55 on the bus. Cancel the ambulance.

01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:40.747
- You sure on that?
- Sure on that.

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:52.263
You did this, you know.

01:32:53.834 --> 01:32:57.292
I know, partner, I know.

01:33:00.441 --> 01:33:02.272
We did good, Tom.

01:33:03.511 --> 01:33:05.945
Tom, Tommy.

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:09.711
We did good. We did good.

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:14.149
You're a good man, Tom.

01:33:14.188 --> 01:33:16.622
You're a good man.

01:33:17.992 --> 01:33:21.018
I wish you...

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:23.360
I wish you

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:26.491
continued success.

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:10.370
Some piece of work, your partner.

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:12.402
Lights.

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:14.243
Look, Cowen,

01:34:14.281 --> 01:34:16.943
the way we see it,

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:19.953
Detective Fisk just closed the door
on the poetry boy.

01:34:26.894 --> 01:34:30.057
Good. Whatever you say.

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:35.368
Are we done?

01:34:35.403 --> 01:34:37.428
Yeah, we're done.

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.358
My daughter called.

01:35:01.395 --> 01:35:05.058
She was upset about Rooster
and worried about me.

01:35:05.099 --> 01:35:08.660
She asked me if I was likely
to do something stupid

01:35:08.703 --> 01:35:11.263
and I said, "Like what,

01:35:11.305 --> 01:35:14.331
take anger management classes
or retire?"

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:17.640
I said I was gonna do
the same old thing I always do.

01:35:17.678 --> 01:35:21.580
She said, "Good.
What else could you do?"

01:35:21.615 --> 01:35:23.276
I said, "Right."

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:26.343
A real chip off the old block,
my daughter.

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:29.618
She said I was a cop
and a good one.

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:33.218
Funny... Rooster said
the same thing.

01:35:36.330 --> 01:35:39.595
Okay, guys,
let's get ready to play ball.

01:35:39.633 --> 01:35:43.467
On the count of three.
Everybody in?

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:47.065
One, two, three, explosion!

01:38:01.752 --> 01:38:02.753
