WEBVTT

01:40.532 --> 01:44.969
Good evening and welcome
to an amazing experience.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.330
The Chinese Martial Arts Team

01:47.573 --> 01:51.475
Fight Demonstration.

03:34.380 --> 03:37.406
Second is sword against the spear.

03:37.649 --> 03:40.447
by Tiger Wong and Jimmy Lee.

04:14.753 --> 04:16.152
Never mind. Go on!

04:20.125 --> 04:20.825
Get down!

04:22.061 --> 04:23.221
Now jump!

04:27.866 --> 04:29.561
I can't believe this!

04:38.444 --> 04:41.675
Next are the women swordfighters.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.940
Lucy Lam and Jane Hung.

04:53.325 --> 04:54.622
When did you start Martial Arts?

04:54.726 --> 04:55.590
When I was eight!

04:59.031 --> 05:00.521
How old are you now?

05:00.632 --> 05:01.530
21.

05:03.602 --> 05:04.830
How do you like America?

05:04.937 --> 05:08.896
I like the cars. We only got bicycles.

05:15.848 --> 05:16.678
Tiger.

05:18.283 --> 05:18.983
Coach.

05:21.820 --> 05:25.483
Smoking is no good foryou. Put it out.

05:26.191 --> 05:27.886
It will kill you.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.326
Hi! Is Tigerthere?

05:38.971 --> 05:39.671
How's it going?

05:41.206 --> 05:43.174
No entrance here!

05:43.509 --> 05:44.339
Take care of them.

05:45.010 --> 05:46.443
How much do you practice each day?

05:46.545 --> 05:47.637
6 hours!

05:48.947 --> 05:51.677
Excuse me, autograph please!

06:00.692 --> 06:01.392
Hi.

06:02.895 --> 06:03.884
How long have you been here?

06:04.296 --> 06:06.093
A long time. You're great!

06:06.198 --> 06:08.530
He trained me!

06:09.668 --> 06:13.195
I rememberyou were a great
cook! Where's my dinner?

06:13.539 --> 06:16.474
As you're leaving soon, you will miss it!

06:16.575 --> 06:17.599
You sure know how to lie!

06:17.910 --> 06:19.241
Gotta go. See you around.

06:21.513 --> 06:23.344
- Tiger, let's go shopping.
- Ok.

06:24.116 --> 06:27.552
This is so beautiful. I
wish I had been born here.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.447
Not me! I'd choose Hong Kong any day!

06:31.790 --> 06:33.587
It's much better.

06:33.692 --> 06:38.186
We had 16$ allowance
forthe stay. That's 1$ a day...

06:38.797 --> 06:40.287
Pretty much nothing.

06:41.200 --> 06:45.330
I already spent 10$.
But what about the rest?

06:45.437 --> 06:47.905
Tiger, anymore softdrinks?

06:48.640 --> 06:50.699
What can you buy for 16$?

06:51.009 --> 06:52.101
Here!

06:58.784 --> 07:02.948
Man, I hate this stuff.
Dunno why the Yanks like it.

07:03.822 --> 07:06.382
At least you can buy it
at all. Nothing at home.

07:08.026 --> 07:10.688
Tiger, you still think of staying here?

07:10.996 --> 07:14.955
If Michael wouldn't have been injured,
I couldn't have come.

07:16.301 --> 07:18.030
This must be my Destiny.

07:19.905 --> 07:22.499
But being a coach at home is not that bad.

07:24.343 --> 07:25.332
Would have been in the old days.

07:26.778 --> 07:30.805
Nowadays you need qualifications.

07:31.283 --> 07:32.045
It's become really hard.

07:32.951 --> 07:35.749
You know some people. They
can make some connections.

07:35.921 --> 07:40.756
Maybe yes.

07:41.693 --> 07:45.026
Driving a train, or cleaning the streets.

07:47.899 --> 07:49.958
This is not what I want.

07:54.273 --> 07:57.367
It's true we have no working skills.

07:59.077 --> 08:02.274
But we're alright. Always
good food and a bed.

08:03.548 --> 08:07.541
And we even can travel around, like here.

08:11.857 --> 08:14.325
Jimmy, you don't understand me.

08:16.228 --> 08:17.388
We're different.

08:34.746 --> 08:37.977
Here guys, your plane tickets.

08:38.083 --> 08:40.483
Give me Tiger's ticket, please.

08:44.656 --> 08:48.023
Tiger, yourticket. Gate 51 in 10 minutes.

08:48.126 --> 08:50.754
Jimmy, let's take a photo.

08:50.862 --> 08:52.591
Let me buy something first.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.598
See you soon, ok?

08:58.603 --> 08:59.627
Great success.

08:59.738 --> 09:02.605
Let's make sure the
officials hear about it.

10:04.169 --> 10:05.966
Tiger! What's up?

10:43.108 --> 10:43.938
Tiger, come back!

10:46.978 --> 10:47.740
Tiger!

10:50.782 --> 10:54.274
You fool! Listen to me!

10:54.386 --> 10:56.183
You think running away will help?

10:56.555 --> 10:58.887
Don't try making me guilty.

11:00.091 --> 11:03.322
I made up my mind. No more China!

11:07.265 --> 11:08.789
Where are they? Hope no trouble occurs.

11:10.836 --> 11:11.928
I've decided.

11:13.672 --> 11:14.866
I'm not going back.

11:16.608 --> 11:18.405
Please let me go.

11:22.714 --> 11:24.978
Jimmy, I'm asking you.

11:51.243 --> 11:52.107
Take care.

11:57.449 --> 11:58.746
Don't forget to write to me.

13:15.126 --> 13:15.854
Over here!

13:29.808 --> 13:30.832
Miss, excuse me.

13:31.142 --> 13:34.737
I'm with the Chinese guys,
they were standing overthere.

13:34.846 --> 13:37.974
I must catch the plane they went to!

13:40.485 --> 13:42.919
I need to get on that airplane, please!

14:26.164 --> 14:27.131
Hello? Hello?

14:27.966 --> 14:30.491
Do you speak Chinese? Hello?

14:51.456 --> 14:54.220
What are you doing?
I need to get my flight.

14:54.526 --> 14:58.189
I am Chinese, what's the matter?

15:34.466 --> 15:37.196
Why don't you tell him
I'm innocent? Tell him!

15:37.969 --> 15:42.838
What's going on here?

15:55.286 --> 15:56.048
Wait here.

16:02.827 --> 16:03.527
Let's go.

16:20.478 --> 16:22.036
No mercy.

16:23.114 --> 16:24.445
We'll get you an ID.

16:24.549 --> 16:25.345
Great, thanks!

16:25.650 --> 16:28.414
Afterthis we go celebrate first.

16:32.457 --> 16:35.790
I go speak to the boss. You wait overthere.

16:40.565 --> 16:41.265
Boss.

16:42.367 --> 16:43.425
I brought the guy.

16:54.012 --> 16:54.876
Protect boss!

18:13.057 --> 18:15.457
Young man, what's your name?

18:22.166 --> 18:25.966
Why didn't you tell me
Tigerwanted to run away?

18:26.537 --> 18:29.904
You knew when the flight was scheduled.

18:30.475 --> 18:33.342
You wanted to run away, too. Right?

18:40.451 --> 18:44.785
You're the only suspect we
have. You might as well confess.

18:45.156 --> 18:47.886
Nobody can defend you here.

19:04.609 --> 19:05.633
Do you have any idea

19:06.411 --> 19:09.869
what shame you brought on China?

19:10.448 --> 19:13.440
We paid your visit here.

19:13.818 --> 19:16.548
And this is the thanks for it?

19:20.625 --> 19:23.822
I will defend you in court.

19:24.162 --> 19:26.096
But be prepared.

19:26.264 --> 19:28.630
It could turn out bad.

22:47.698 --> 22:49.029
Home, sweet home.

22:56.974 --> 23:00.102
It's not the best, but we
won't stay long anyway.

23:00.678 --> 23:03.875
In a refugee camp at HK there
would be 30 people in here.

23:04.182 --> 23:07.777
Yes. The standards
are slightly higher here.

23:07.885 --> 23:08.585
You can forget about refugees now.

23:13.124 --> 23:14.284
This is wonderful.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.053
Pretty average for America.

23:17.395 --> 23:19.795
Sounds good. But how does it cost?

23:19.897 --> 23:20.625
Not much.

23:21.866 --> 23:23.595
- Let me.
- I can do it, thanks.

23:33.744 --> 23:37.305
Mum and Dad would love
this. Why did they have to die?

23:38.316 --> 23:41.843
Please. This is over now.

23:43.487 --> 23:44.187
Wait a second.

23:51.362 --> 23:55.628
The bastards will come
for revenge. Be careful.

23:56.467 --> 23:58.332
Wipe them all out!

24:02.607 --> 24:04.632
I won't hide because of this scum.

24:06.944 --> 24:07.933
I'll call you back.

24:13.718 --> 24:14.418
Who is it?

24:17.321 --> 24:18.720
What is it? \- Hide!

24:20.791 --> 24:21.723
No time forthis!

24:55.226 --> 24:55.954
Jump!

25:02.600 --> 25:03.300
Come on.

25:04.035 --> 25:04.735
Bill!

25:13.711 --> 25:14.575
Oh my God!

26:00.491 --> 26:01.224
No!

26:01.225 --> 26:02.123
Stay here!

26:05.062 --> 26:06.324
Bill! Bill!

26:12.136 --> 26:12.966
Bill.

26:16.907 --> 26:17.874
Bill!

26:44.101 --> 26:46.763
Bill! What is it?
- Who are you?

26:46.871 --> 26:49.305
How come you know him? Who are you?

26:49.407 --> 26:50.135
Wait!

27:16.267 --> 27:19.395
Chinese Kung Fu Hero!

27:19.503 --> 27:22.131
You signed your autograph for me!

27:53.304 --> 27:55.568
You can trust me. Where else can you go?

27:56.841 --> 27:57.603
Relax.

28:08.919 --> 28:12.150
You can sleep here forthe time being.

28:12.890 --> 28:13.652
Thanks a lot.

28:13.757 --> 28:18.285
That's alright! I still can't
believe you are here with me!

28:18.395 --> 28:23.162
Great Chinese Martial
Arts Hero lives in my house.

28:23.267 --> 28:24.131
Andy.

28:25.870 --> 28:26.700
It's ok.

28:27.771 --> 28:28.471
Uncle.

28:30.207 --> 28:33.836
How come you never
mentioned yourfriend to me?

28:34.578 --> 28:36.068
He's from Hong Kong.

28:36.280 --> 28:41.149
He just arrived an hour ago.

28:41.252 --> 28:43.277
He isn't a refugee, is he?

28:43.387 --> 28:47.221
Of course not! Please
don't whisper in front ofhim.

28:47.825 --> 28:51.420
Just be careful and
keep your eyes open, ok?

28:51.529 --> 28:53.690
I know, don't worry.

28:59.637 --> 29:01.195
Please sit down.

29:03.040 --> 29:06.305
Andy told me you are
his old friend from HK.

29:06.410 --> 29:08.310
Yes, you remember?

29:08.412 --> 29:11.745
We always made rude
jokes about the teachers.

29:13.317 --> 29:16.616
Uncle's a good guy.
He's got a heart of gold.

29:16.720 --> 29:17.914
You better shut up!

29:19.023 --> 29:21.321
You make yourself comfortable.

29:22.660 --> 29:25.185
You sure have a lot to talk about.

29:25.863 --> 29:28.127
Hey, if you're hungry,
just go to the kitchen.

29:28.232 --> 29:29.529
Ok, we will.

29:29.633 --> 29:31.863
Thanks. You're really kind.

29:31.969 --> 29:33.596
You're welcome.

29:33.704 --> 29:35.672
Don't forget to open the store tomorrow!

29:35.773 --> 29:37.035
Yeah.

29:40.578 --> 29:41.278
Sit down.

29:42.479 --> 29:46.939
He's really great. Don't worry about him.

29:53.257 --> 29:55.316
Are you hungry? Want a Hamburger?

29:57.795 --> 30:00.764
Don't worry. I have enough money.

30:01.699 --> 30:04.793
Uncle is really generous.
You will be alright with us.

30:08.639 --> 30:09.537
I don't want to trouble you.

30:09.640 --> 30:13.838
Look Jimmy, we're
friends. I must help you out.

30:14.912 --> 30:16.812
I believe you are innocent.

30:18.115 --> 30:20.709
But, what did really happen?

30:22.786 --> 30:26.051
I don't know. It just got out of control.

30:33.764 --> 30:37.996
Don't worry. The truth will
come out sooner or later.

30:40.804 --> 30:44.900
No need to worry. US Laws are really fair.

30:45.042 --> 30:48.808
You just make them believe
you got "Commie-Phobia".

30:51.715 --> 30:55.151
Come on now. You will be safe.

30:55.419 --> 30:57.284
"Superior man survives the trial."

31:05.329 --> 31:06.591
I better go now.

31:51.942 --> 31:52.931
You wait here.
- Yes!

33:14.691 --> 33:16.056
I have something foryou. Come.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.236
Well?

33:36.413 --> 33:37.573
He's not there anymore.

33:38.816 --> 33:43.844
USA is a big place. Not
so easy to find one person.

33:47.057 --> 33:50.390
Come on now. Don't be depressed again.

33:50.694 --> 33:54.994
If you got money, you will get
a new passport no matter how.

33:56.733 --> 34:01.193
Maybe we should play the
lottery. Would be some good bucks.

34:02.172 --> 34:07.769
Trust me. If you believe in your luck
you will get it one day.

34:28.332 --> 34:31.324
If you want to be an
ABC, learn three things:

34:31.501 --> 34:34.993
First - get a driver's licence.

34:35.339 --> 34:38.775
If you don't have a car
here, it's like being a cripple!

34:38.876 --> 34:41.276
Can't even pick up chicks
without some wheels!

35:00.530 --> 35:05.991
Second - even if you are jobless,
Uncle Sam has some bucks foryou.

35:06.236 --> 35:10.969
Betterthan starving to death anyway.

35:11.074 --> 35:14.100
Where did you park the car anyway?

35:15.345 --> 35:16.505
Who the hell are you?

35:16.747 --> 35:17.611
None of your business!

35:17.714 --> 35:18.414
Fuck you!

35:23.287 --> 35:24.879
Here, here!

35:50.948 --> 35:55.851
Third - if there's nothing in it foryou,
don't ever get involved!

35:55.953 --> 35:59.787
No matterwhat happens, just ignore it!

36:34.591 --> 36:35.353
What's going on?

36:35.625 --> 36:36.523
Stay calm.

36:36.793 --> 36:37.555
What is it?

36:37.761 --> 36:40.924
They started the trouble.

37:13.563 --> 37:14.530
Let's go.

38:17.761 --> 38:19.524
My god. What was that?

38:22.165 --> 38:24.429
Ah, yes. About your passport.

38:24.534 --> 38:25.234
What?

38:25.302 --> 38:26.701
Not as easy as I thought.

38:27.070 --> 38:31.439
It ain't just the cash.
It must also be a real good fake one.

38:33.543 --> 38:36.137
That's what I call a miracle.

38:41.384 --> 38:42.715
Gotta catch this bird.

38:54.598 --> 38:56.088
Don't mess around.

38:56.466 --> 38:57.831
Miss, where to?

39:00.704 --> 39:02.729
Don't you like naked Chinese guys?

39:04.808 --> 39:06.503
!%&*?#@

39:06.610 --> 39:07.440
What was that?

39:07.544 --> 39:09.307
Japanese!

39:11.047 --> 39:12.105
Damn! I'll follow her!

39:32.836 --> 39:36.135
Look at these breasts.

39:57.194 --> 39:58.627
Look at these THINGS!

39:59.563 --> 40:00.621
Damn, the carwon't move.

40:01.665 --> 40:02.962
Get off the car.

40:07.704 --> 40:09.797
I told you not to mess around.

40:11.608 --> 40:12.404
See what you've done!

40:12.509 --> 40:14.170
She must be lesbian anyway.

40:53.316 --> 40:55.841
Honey, wait for me tonight.

41:26.049 --> 41:29.951
There he comes. It
will be okay, don't worry.

41:38.094 --> 41:38.794
Sit down.

41:44.467 --> 41:49.166
The Colombians have arrived. I
would like Tigerto take care of them.

41:52.008 --> 41:52.997
What do you say?

41:54.244 --> 41:55.268
No problem.

41:55.545 --> 41:57.604
I think Tiger is something really special.

41:58.481 --> 42:03.646
You're so silent. Nothing to say about it?

42:16.366 --> 42:17.094
Marco?

42:18.802 --> 42:20.770
Yes. You're alright.

42:21.004 --> 42:21.766
Marco!

42:35.785 --> 42:39.380
Andy, I had to get the clutch
fixed. Take care of the car.

42:39.489 --> 42:41.980
This is not a racing car, understand?

42:42.092 --> 42:43.616
Of course not!

42:53.903 --> 42:55.700
Come on. Are you dreaming?

42:59.509 --> 43:00.209
Hey, Jim.

43:00.977 --> 43:02.103
Nice car overthere.

43:02.612 --> 43:04.944
It's alright.

43:06.015 --> 43:10.145
I can dream, can't I? I would by such car
if had the money.

43:10.253 --> 43:14.280
Talk less and work more.

43:14.624 --> 43:15.955
This will take me 100 years!

43:16.059 --> 43:16.821
So what!?

43:37.647 --> 43:38.807
All done.

43:55.765 --> 43:56.498
Tiger!

43:56.499 --> 43:57.363
Tiger!

44:00.603 --> 44:01.303
Tiger!

44:04.107 --> 44:04.807
Jimmy?

44:05.508 --> 44:09.035
Look, I didn't mean to kill that cop.

44:09.212 --> 44:12.272
But you killed him, after all. Now what?

44:12.949 --> 44:14.507
An they hold me responsible!

44:18.087 --> 44:22.217
You're right. It was my fault.

44:22.926 --> 44:25.918
You want me to give in?

44:27.030 --> 44:27.758
No way.

44:34.003 --> 44:38.406
Listen. We are friends foryears now.
I can arrange things here.

44:39.542 --> 44:44.411
Why did we ever come over here?
We should have stayed in China.

44:45.348 --> 44:47.612
We were once friends, remember?

44:52.455 --> 44:55.447
You miss China? But there was no freedom.

44:56.826 --> 44:58.157
Did you really like it?

44:59.362 --> 45:00.488
Like some circus animal.

45:03.500 --> 45:06.594
I see it now. We were
only puppets overthere.

45:10.974 --> 45:14.102
Jim, I've seen a better side to life.

45:15.111 --> 45:15.811
And I like it.

45:19.682 --> 45:21.047
This is just great.

45:23.620 --> 45:25.815
If you want it, you can have it.

45:27.257 --> 45:31.091
So you bought into the great
life and betrayed us both.

45:35.098 --> 45:36.292
It just happened.

45:37.600 --> 45:42.128
Let's get real. China can never offerthis!

45:43.806 --> 45:47.037
But don't you even miss your family?

45:49.579 --> 45:52.309
They're ok now. Listen, Jim.

45:53.716 --> 45:56.913
They'll have everything.

45:57.754 --> 46:00.154
I will get them here, too.

46:07.063 --> 46:09.088
You think you can buy everything?

46:12.402 --> 46:17.203
No. But it's the only thing I can offer.

46:18.207 --> 46:22.109
I want my name cleared and go back home.

46:24.681 --> 46:25.381
Jim.

46:29.018 --> 46:32.146
No Tiger. We're not on
the same road anymore.

46:36.926 --> 46:40.191
DearJim, thanks forthe money you sent us.

46:40.897 --> 46:43.832
You'll be happy to know the Police
have stopped looking for me.

46:45.034 --> 46:49.232
Everyone's fine. Don't worry about us.

46:49.872 --> 46:52.966
We know you're innocent.

46:54.210 --> 46:56.542
We pray forthe day you come back home.

46:57.113 --> 47:01.573
Keep smiling. Everything
will be fine in the end.

47:21.471 --> 47:22.335
Excuse me.

47:24.073 --> 47:25.233
We need to talk.

47:26.643 --> 47:27.541
I'm busy now.

47:34.217 --> 47:37.482
I really want to help.
I want to introduce a friend of mine.

47:43.226 --> 47:45.694
You love Kung Fu. You must practice.

47:46.963 --> 47:48.362
You don't really want to work here.

47:51.167 --> 47:53.431
just let me help you once more.

47:56.973 --> 47:58.235
Don't you miss yourfriends?

48:11.688 --> 48:14.748
Jim, everything will be fine.

48:44.454 --> 48:45.182
Marco.

48:45.655 --> 48:46.451
Sit.

48:47.824 --> 48:49.587
Make yourself gone, honey.

48:51.527 --> 48:54.394
Remember Marco, what
we talked the other day?

48:57.800 --> 48:58.960
This is my friend.

49:01.604 --> 49:02.593
Sorry, what was that?

49:02.705 --> 49:03.967
The passport matter.

49:07.176 --> 49:11.840
You look smart. So
Tiger is a friend of yours?

49:14.784 --> 49:17.309
Tiger, is he another
Chinese runaway fighter?

49:17.854 --> 49:18.554
Marco...

49:19.355 --> 49:21.755
Getting a passport is no problem.

49:21.858 --> 49:24.691
The problem is I don't like him.

49:25.828 --> 49:28.524
Please, Marco. Are you gonna help him?

49:30.466 --> 49:33.560
You jumped-off peasant.
Who do you think you talk to?

49:35.471 --> 49:36.699
But you said that you...

49:36.806 --> 49:39.673
I lied. I never meant a word ofit.

49:40.042 --> 49:40.742
Excuse me.

49:42.311 --> 49:43.073
I'll leave now.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.180
Hey, Jim!

49:47.717 --> 49:49.912
Marco, what the fuck is this?

49:52.655 --> 49:55.954
What was that? How dare you?

49:56.192 --> 50:00.891
If not for me, where you would you be now?

50:01.364 --> 50:04.800
I brought Jim out of respect.
I could have bypassed you.

50:05.101 --> 50:09.561
I don't need to ask foryour help!

50:11.007 --> 50:16.001
You little peasant. You want
the drugs, now the passports?

50:16.846 --> 50:20.247
I wasn't, but you threw it to me right now!

50:23.786 --> 50:24.810
Damn bastard!

50:30.927 --> 50:34.693
What's there to see? Any problem?

50:35.164 --> 50:37.291
You understand Cantonese?

50:38.234 --> 50:41.328
Why don't you watch? Don't understand me?

50:42.438 --> 50:43.427
You understand me.

50:45.541 --> 50:47.736
What's there to look at?

50:47.977 --> 50:49.638
What is it, fucking bitch?

50:56.686 --> 50:57.386
Jim.

50:59.155 --> 50:59.855
Where to?

51:01.257 --> 51:04.055
Tiger, I don't belong in yourworld.

51:05.027 --> 51:07.894
I'm sorry, but I won't let you go down.

51:09.765 --> 51:13.599
Tiger, just forget it. I'm not interested.

51:18.274 --> 51:23.268
Listen to me. If you carry on like this,
you will end up bad.

51:35.925 --> 51:37.790
Where to? Can I give you a ride?

51:47.103 --> 51:48.570
I was surprised to meet you there.

51:51.774 --> 51:52.866
Got something on your mind?

51:54.510 --> 52:00.510
Yes. When I came from
Vietnam, I thought I could be free.

52:02.018 --> 52:06.216
Start all over again, make a new life.

52:07.723 --> 52:08.747
What happened?

52:12.228 --> 52:13.820
There was a lot for me to learn.

52:15.498 --> 52:18.831
Some ofit was not very pleasant.

52:21.237 --> 52:21.937
And you?

52:26.709 --> 52:28.176
I don't think you killed anybody.

52:29.278 --> 52:30.142
Thanks.

52:33.783 --> 52:35.216
We barely know each other.

52:36.085 --> 52:40.146
But my intuition tells
me you're a good man.

52:43.526 --> 52:44.925
I shouldn't be here today.

52:46.829 --> 52:49.821
The time where a passport would
have solved everything is gone.

52:52.401 --> 52:53.629
I'm gonna have to face it.

52:58.641 --> 53:00.472
Do you believe we can
create our own future?

53:00.943 --> 53:04.572
I don't know. It depends on fate.

53:05.381 --> 53:06.081
What do you think?

53:06.282 --> 53:07.249
I believe in fate.

53:07.917 --> 53:13.014
Whatever happens is created by us.

53:52.428 --> 53:53.520
I'm going out.

53:53.896 --> 53:55.363
Oh, no, no, no, no.

53:56.065 --> 53:59.296
We're all gonna have some fun tonight.

53:59.769 --> 54:01.430
You will join us.

54:06.942 --> 54:07.704
Hold it!

54:13.849 --> 54:15.111
Pick it up.

54:18.788 --> 54:19.584
Pick it up!

54:25.928 --> 54:27.190
Won't you do it?

54:29.765 --> 54:30.732
Pick it up!

54:32.468 --> 54:36.234
Who do you think you
are, fucking boat people!

54:53.289 --> 54:54.483
- What is it?
- Bastards!

55:06.268 --> 55:06.968
Great kick!

55:09.038 --> 55:10.869
Wanna get away?

55:12.108 --> 55:13.006
Why did they beat you?

55:13.109 --> 55:14.098
I don't know myself!

55:16.712 --> 55:17.542
You owe him money?

55:17.746 --> 55:18.576
No!

55:20.716 --> 55:24.208
Only a few hundred. No need to beat me.

55:24.620 --> 55:25.450
Don't go!

55:25.888 --> 55:27.014
Why do you owe them money?

55:30.392 --> 55:32.223
I lost it gambling.

55:32.328 --> 55:33.556
Why didn't you tell me?

55:34.697 --> 55:37.791
What difference would it
make? You help me anyway!

55:38.134 --> 55:40.295
I want to know the
truth. Aren't we friends?

55:42.304 --> 55:44.295
You're not a fool. Don't act like one!

56:51.874 --> 56:53.535
Shit. Some nerd in my parking space again.

59:43.145 --> 59:48.048
I heard you blew it today.
Getting too confident maybe.

59:51.687 --> 59:52.517
Tiger.

59:53.589 --> 59:58.083
Don't be so greedy.
Rome wasn't built in a day.

59:59.928 --> 1:00:01.327
There are things you got to learn.

1:00:57.152 --> 1:00:57.852
Hungry?

1:00:59.221 --> 1:01:03.089
These are damaged goods
we can't sell so I can eat them.

1:01:04.326 --> 1:01:08.524
Still angry about yesterday?
I only wanted to help you.

1:01:13.068 --> 1:01:14.365
Yes, I know I was wrong.

1:01:16.472 --> 1:01:17.837
No more gambling.

1:01:22.244 --> 1:01:25.577
I'll get you the cash.
You must pay them back.

1:01:26.348 --> 1:01:28.543
Thanks a lot. I'm on my way.

1:01:32.488 --> 1:01:35.082
Do me a little favour and
come with me, please.

1:01:50.572 --> 1:01:52.563
Sit down and look cool.

1:01:54.843 --> 1:01:56.435
Wait here.

1:02:58.574 --> 1:02:59.506
One Million?

1:03:06.448 --> 1:03:07.148
America...

1:03:24.166 --> 1:03:25.326
This one's open.

1:03:29.338 --> 1:03:32.865
Ah, damaged goods.

1:03:57.699 --> 1:04:02.261
Damn, clumsy as a little kid.

1:04:04.906 --> 1:04:06.703
Hey, you come here often?

1:04:08.076 --> 1:04:10.067
I said, do you come here often?

1:04:12.214 --> 1:04:16.173
Yes, it's nice here. Feeling good.

1:04:16.385 --> 1:04:20.082
If I feel bad, I come here too.

1:04:21.823 --> 1:04:23.085
Sorry.

1:04:25.594 --> 1:04:26.360
I'm feeling good today.

1:04:26.361 --> 1:04:27.061
Hey!

1:04:27.829 --> 1:04:31.162
Who knows what you
can do when you're drunk.

1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:33.565
Soon I'll buy that bridge.

1:04:33.669 --> 1:04:37.332
You won't get rich, dreaming again.

1:04:37.439 --> 1:04:39.066
I don't dream and I'll do it.

1:04:39.875 --> 1:04:44.505
Working won't get us the real big money.

1:04:45.147 --> 1:04:49.584
Chink, they call us Chinese
Pigs, Second Class People.

1:04:50.318 --> 1:04:51.615
Money will make me First Class.

1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:52.482
So what?

1:04:52.587 --> 1:04:55.522
I'll go to Hong Kong!

1:04:55.691 --> 1:04:58.489
But you always said HK is bullshit.

1:04:58.593 --> 1:05:01.323
But only if you're poor!

1:05:01.463 --> 1:05:04.364
If you're rich, it's fantastic.
Here you make the money!

1:05:04.733 --> 1:05:08.430
I am Chinese, I belong overthere.

1:05:17.212 --> 1:05:19.476
Sorry, I got carried away.

1:05:20.415 --> 1:05:25.318
I'll take care of you. And if we get
lucky, you come with me to HK.

1:05:29.891 --> 1:05:30.915
Just leave it to me.

1:05:32.127 --> 1:05:35.790
Alright. Would you take
Mr.Dick out of the conversation?

1:05:38.767 --> 1:05:39.467
He likes fresh air.

1:06:54.943 --> 1:06:55.705
- Hello, Jim!
- Hi!

1:06:58.013 --> 1:06:58.843
How you doing?

1:07:00.749 --> 1:07:01.716
What is it?

1:07:28.410 --> 1:07:30.571
Crazy? What are you doing?

1:07:30.679 --> 1:07:31.873
What's going on?

1:07:34.950 --> 1:07:35.917
I'll pay later, ok?

1:07:36.918 --> 1:07:38.317
You're crazy.

1:07:43.291 --> 1:07:44.258
Please wait.

1:07:45.393 --> 1:07:46.121
It's foryou.

1:07:46.761 --> 1:07:47.819
For me?

1:07:55.904 --> 1:07:58.896
Alright. I'll be there.

1:08:00.208 --> 1:08:02.802
Uncle, can I go out? It's urgent.

1:08:02.911 --> 1:08:04.139
Ok.

1:08:06.815 --> 1:08:08.874
Hey, you're meeting a chick, right?

1:08:09.551 --> 1:08:10.609
Good boy!

1:08:11.419 --> 1:08:15.378
Give her one for me,
you rat! Bring her over!

1:08:17.158 --> 1:08:19.718
Andy, I want that money.

1:08:21.696 --> 1:08:22.822
This doesn't cover it.

1:08:47.022 --> 1:08:49.684
Andy, can you stop messing around for once?

1:08:50.558 --> 1:08:51.422
Look at it!

1:08:51.526 --> 1:08:53.221
Where is the damaged one?

1:08:54.062 --> 1:08:54.762
Damaged one?

1:08:54.796 --> 1:08:56.730
It had "NOT FOR SALE" on the box.

1:08:57.632 --> 1:09:00.430
Of course, I used it all up yesterday.

1:09:04.806 --> 1:09:07.707
Andy, what are you doing?

1:09:07.809 --> 1:09:10.972
Half a box? You couldn't have used it all!

1:09:11.479 --> 1:09:16.781
I was clumsy and dropped
all ofit into the kitchen sink.

1:09:22.057 --> 1:09:24.048
Have you gone mad?

1:09:24.159 --> 1:09:27.253
Stop it! It's long gone now.

1:09:29.898 --> 1:09:32.662
Why not these boxes overthere?

1:09:33.201 --> 1:09:34.668
Why didn't you use them?

1:09:34.769 --> 1:09:36.669
I told you a thousand times...

1:09:37.339 --> 1:09:38.465
Stupid Bastard!

1:09:40.475 --> 1:09:41.175
One Million!

1:09:42.310 --> 1:09:43.072
One Million what?

1:09:43.178 --> 1:09:45.078
One Million Dollars!

1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:46.679
One Million Dollars? Bullshit!

1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:54.780
Go serve the costumers.

1:09:54.889 --> 1:09:56.982
Come on now.

1:10:27.188 --> 1:10:28.951
Motherfucker. I said no!

1:11:08.730 --> 1:11:09.628
What's the matter?

1:11:11.032 --> 1:11:11.732
Where is the kid?

1:11:12.567 --> 1:11:13.966
I'm leaving here.

1:11:15.370 --> 1:11:16.394
You're going for long?

1:11:18.606 --> 1:11:22.042
I thought about what you
said and I think you're right.

1:11:23.645 --> 1:11:28.173
I was just chasing
afterthings not worth having.

1:11:28.850 --> 1:11:30.249
I'm leaving Marco.

1:11:35.156 --> 1:11:36.646
Any idea where you'll go?

1:11:40.628 --> 1:11:42.255
I don't have any friends here.

1:11:44.532 --> 1:11:47.899
Except you.

1:11:48.670 --> 1:11:52.367
I have only two friends here, too.

1:11:53.041 --> 1:11:54.201
Uncle, I'm back!

1:11:57.912 --> 1:11:59.846
What happened here?

1:12:00.215 --> 1:12:03.412
I don't know what this is about.

1:12:03.518 --> 1:12:07.784
Some guys came in here asking for
Andy and trashed the place.

1:12:07.889 --> 1:12:09.481
Even beat me up!

1:12:09.591 --> 1:12:10.421
Where is he?

1:12:10.859 --> 1:12:13.987
How the hell do I know.

1:12:15.530 --> 1:12:16.497
Hello, Andy?

1:12:16.598 --> 1:12:19.260
No, it's Tiger. I must see you.

1:12:19.367 --> 1:12:20.231
No.

1:12:21.136 --> 1:12:23.764
You saw the store.

1:12:24.272 --> 1:12:26.502
You did this? What for?

1:12:26.608 --> 1:12:28.269
Come and I'll tell you.

1:12:42.991 --> 1:12:46.222
Ok, Tiger. I am here,
now explain everything.

1:12:49.364 --> 1:12:52.629
Jim, I never knew you're such a snake.

1:12:53.668 --> 1:12:58.401
I even tried to get you a
passport. And you betray me?

1:12:59.407 --> 1:13:00.738
What are you talking about?

1:13:02.977 --> 1:13:05.605
I only wanna know why you did it!

1:13:07.081 --> 1:13:07.877
You took something from me.

1:13:08.283 --> 1:13:10.774
What thing? I don't have anything!

1:13:11.352 --> 1:13:14.515
I don't buy this, Jim.
The Black Man saw it.

1:13:18.092 --> 1:13:18.956
Andy.

1:13:20.295 --> 1:13:22.525
I'll give you some more time.

1:13:23.731 --> 1:13:25.096
But not very much time!

1:13:26.067 --> 1:13:26.767
Tiger.

1:13:28.570 --> 1:13:29.867
I haven't taken anything.

1:13:29.971 --> 1:13:31.165
Stop lying.

1:13:31.272 --> 1:13:36.300
I don't care what you
say. I don't have anything.

1:13:38.646 --> 1:13:39.346
Don't move!

1:13:40.815 --> 1:13:44.615
Awarning - If you get
in my way, I'll kill you!

1:13:45.753 --> 1:13:49.416
We're not friends anymore from now on.

1:13:50.758 --> 1:13:53.090
Get me the stuffback in 12 hours.

1:13:54.462 --> 1:13:57.522
I am warning you as well.

1:13:58.233 --> 1:14:00.394
Get lost, or I'll come afteryou!

1:16:15.536 --> 1:16:16.298
Tiger.

1:16:23.344 --> 1:16:26.336
I know the guy who
took the stuffis yourfriend.

1:16:26.881 --> 1:16:30.214
I don't know how, but
you gotta take care ofit.

1:16:31.419 --> 1:16:34.718
It wasn't easy foryou all long, I know.

1:16:35.590 --> 1:16:37.751
Don't blow this one.

1:16:38.359 --> 1:16:40.122
I trust you on this.

1:17:01.015 --> 1:17:01.715
Andy!

1:17:03.151 --> 1:17:04.413
Stay there!

1:17:05.653 --> 1:17:09.714
Uncle was hurt and the store trashed.

1:17:16.631 --> 1:17:17.655
Is he alright?

1:17:18.299 --> 1:17:19.323
Did you steal from them?

1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:21.363
I asked you ifhe was ok?

1:17:21.969 --> 1:17:23.459
Did you take the stuff?

1:17:29.911 --> 1:17:31.242
It was just a small bag.

1:17:37.919 --> 1:17:39.318
It's all gone.

1:17:42.890 --> 1:17:43.948
I must leave.

1:17:44.225 --> 1:17:45.715
And what about uncle?

1:17:57.138 --> 1:17:58.765
Andy, won't you see him?

1:18:00.608 --> 1:18:03.372
I'm afraid to face him.

1:18:03.711 --> 1:18:06.509
Can you first explain it to him?

1:18:06.614 --> 1:18:08.081
Alright, I understand.

1:18:20.027 --> 1:18:20.727
Uncle!

1:18:23.030 --> 1:18:23.894
The stuff!

1:18:23.998 --> 1:18:24.726
Where's uncle?

1:18:34.442 --> 1:18:35.142
Uncle!

1:18:38.746 --> 1:18:39.872
Give me the stuff.

1:18:41.382 --> 1:18:43.714
I didn't take it, so let him go!

1:18:43.818 --> 1:18:46.514
That means yourfriend took it!

1:18:46.754 --> 1:18:49.154
He used it as soak powder.

1:18:49.257 --> 1:18:50.155
Soak Powder!

1:18:51.492 --> 1:18:52.481
You're lying!

1:18:55.429 --> 1:18:56.396
Uncle!

1:19:41.709 --> 1:19:45.338
Tiger, how could you ever become like that!

1:21:15.036 --> 1:21:16.003
Jimmy!

1:21:25.613 --> 1:21:27.046
You son of a bitch!

1:21:27.148 --> 1:21:28.342
Don't get out!

1:21:33.254 --> 1:21:34.687
Come on! Come!

1:21:35.156 --> 1:21:38.887
Bastard! I'll kill you!

1:21:41.662 --> 1:21:43.027
Die! Die!

1:21:59.080 --> 1:22:00.069
Where is the stuff?

1:22:00.781 --> 1:22:01.577
Don't know.

1:22:04.552 --> 1:22:05.746
Talk! Where is it?

1:22:06.353 --> 1:22:07.251
Your mother has it.

1:22:11.358 --> 1:22:12.120
Tell me!

1:22:27.308 --> 1:22:28.536
Get in the car quick.

1:22:28.876 --> 1:22:29.843
No, wait!

1:22:39.754 --> 1:22:40.550
Go!

1:22:40.554 --> 1:22:41.321
Andy!

1:22:41.322 --> 1:22:42.220
Move!

1:22:43.190 --> 1:22:44.088
Let me go.

1:23:07.481 --> 1:23:08.539
Hold on tight.

1:24:22.456 --> 1:24:24.048
Jimmy, are you ok?

1:24:25.092 --> 1:24:26.320
Hey, are you alright?

1:24:36.570 --> 1:24:40.529
I was remembering how
happy we were as kids in China.

1:24:41.275 --> 1:24:43.175
He was my best friend.

1:24:48.682 --> 1:24:50.843
Now we're the worst of enemies.

1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:57.950
I guess this is what we call Fate.

1:25:00.394 --> 1:25:02.419
Now nothing and nobody can help us.

1:25:02.529 --> 1:25:07.159
Where can you go now?

1:25:07.268 --> 1:25:10.760
I don't know. I really don't know.

1:25:11.605 --> 1:25:14.574
I had Andy and Uncle.

1:25:15.309 --> 1:25:18.801
My only two friends here I had.

1:25:20.214 --> 1:25:24.378
Now they are both dead. Murdered.

1:25:27.421 --> 1:25:28.786
I must avenge them.

1:25:29.189 --> 1:25:30.247
I only want to say...

1:25:32.559 --> 1:25:35.392
...you still have one friend here.

1:26:53.707 --> 1:26:55.800
Jimmy!

1:26:57.811 --> 1:27:01.577
How could he get away so easily?

1:27:01.682 --> 1:27:04.116
Just give me a few more days.

1:27:04.718 --> 1:27:08.051
Alright. But deliver or die!

1:27:08.422 --> 1:27:11.448
This is only about money.
Words mean nothing now.

1:27:12.059 --> 1:27:13.083
I know.

1:27:30.711 --> 1:27:34.078
I would have looked
foryou. Good you're here.

1:27:36.483 --> 1:27:39.646
Since we were kids, you were the smart one.

1:27:40.754 --> 1:27:44.349
I was always numbertwo.
But now finally I made it!

1:27:44.591 --> 1:27:46.252
You won't destroy it!

1:27:47.361 --> 1:27:51.161
You live like you want. But
you can't kill innocent people!

1:27:51.265 --> 1:27:53.790
I can! I can do anything I want to!

1:27:55.736 --> 1:27:58.398
Jim, I'll give you one more chance.

1:27:58.972 --> 1:28:00.337
Just give me the stuff.

1:28:01.175 --> 1:28:03.973
Then you can leave, else
the boss will take care of you.

1:28:04.545 --> 1:28:07.639
You don't stand a chance, Tiger!

1:35:40.500 --> 1:35:41.262
Jimmy...

1:35:42.836 --> 1:35:46.363
I could have made it
big, why did you stop me...
