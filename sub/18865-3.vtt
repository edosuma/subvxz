WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.538
- What are these sad print-outs?

00:06.573 --> 00:10.275
- They're for a proposal I plan
on making to the family.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.511
- And what kind of proposal
is this, Mr. Rose?

00:12.546 --> 00:15.213
- Are the police auctioning off
crime scene vehicles?

00:15.248 --> 00:16.848
- No, these are only examples,

00:16.883 --> 00:18.250
uh, for the proposal.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.786
I think it's time
we invest in a car.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.021
- I really don't see myself
driving any of these.

00:23.056 --> 00:24.423
- Now, these are just examples.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.824
- Yeah, I would rather
drive a scooter.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.926
And we all know how I feel
about scooters,

00:27.961 --> 00:29.828
those stupid helmets.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.897
- All right, let's forget
the print-outs.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.865
All right? I just think...

00:33.900 --> 00:35.700
we could use a car.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.836
Everyone has a car!

00:37.871 --> 00:40.038
Roland has a car,
Bob has three cars.

00:40.073 --> 00:42.240
Stevie has a car.

00:42.275 --> 00:44.042
I want a car!

00:44.077 --> 00:45.544
- Does this site have boats?

00:45.579 --> 00:48.280
- Okay, here's what
I put together.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.983
- Is that a spreadsheet?
- Yes, yes, it is.

00:52.018 --> 00:53.218
And if you'd just let me
finish the pitch

00:53.253 --> 00:54.953
the way I planned it,

00:54.988 --> 00:56.455
things will be a lot more clear.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.290
- Okay, well, I'm gonna need
the car on Friday nights.

00:58.325 --> 01:00.125
- Absolutely not.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.359
- Meaning that I would
get it Saturday.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.128
- We don't even have
the car yet!

01:03.163 --> 01:05.263
- Okay, we're just trying
to work within your schedule.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.232
- Ohh! This is not your best
pitch, darling.

01:07.267 --> 01:09.201
- I haven't even started
the pitch, Moira!

01:09.236 --> 01:10.702
Okay, you know what?!

01:10.737 --> 01:11.937
I'm buying a car!

01:13.573 --> 01:14.773
End of story.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.609
- Where are you going?

01:19.012 --> 01:20.479
- Here.

01:21.848 --> 01:25.884
♪ ♪

01:27.487 --> 01:29.121
- You know, really don't have
to go with me, Moira.

01:29.156 --> 01:30.555
- Oh, I insist.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.491
This is a big decision,
and there's no reason

01:32.526 --> 01:34.459
it should rest solely
on your shoulders, dear.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.561
- You know, I actually
like buying cars.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.098
- And you're very good at it.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.867
But sometimes your choices...

01:41.902 --> 01:44.336
are less suited
to a family's needs,

01:44.371 --> 01:47.205
and more suited to a ponytailed
lothario,

01:47.240 --> 01:49.341
cruising the Monte Carlo coast.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.476
- Or like um, Vin Diesel.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.545
- It's called style, people.

01:53.580 --> 01:54.779
- (Scoffs)

01:54.814 --> 01:56.481
- And you're brimming with it,
darling.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.183
But each of us is going
to drive this,

01:58.218 --> 02:00.519
and a car says a lot
about a person.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.221
- Not that we can afford a car
that says a lot about us,

02:03.256 --> 02:05.624
We did decide to only
budget $4,000...

02:05.659 --> 02:07.459
of my money.

02:07.494 --> 02:09.661
- You know, he's got a point
there, honey.

02:09.696 --> 02:12.264
We can't be eating
into the family funds.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.599
- Well, fault my
overzealousness,

02:14.634 --> 02:17.435
but I think I can-we can find

02:17.470 --> 02:20.305
a zippy little vintage
something on budget.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.307
- Not dressed like that,
you can't.

02:22.342 --> 02:23.708
- You bought me this dress,
David.

02:23.743 --> 02:25.010
- I know!

02:25.045 --> 02:27.846
And it cost twice as much
as the car you wanna buy.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.515
No used car salesman
is gonna cut you a deal

02:30.550 --> 02:33.318
dressed in archival
designer silk.

02:33.353 --> 02:35.053
- You know, He's got a point
there, honey.

02:35.088 --> 02:38.156
- Yeah, says the moving target
in the Bespoke suit.

02:38.191 --> 02:41.193
- Well, I'm not just gonna be
wearing a suit today, David.

02:41.228 --> 02:43.161
I've got a ball cap
I can put on.

02:43.196 --> 02:45.297
- Oh!
- David's right.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.698
But you know what?

02:46.733 --> 02:49.634
I could build
an appropriate look...

02:49.669 --> 02:52.437
to mimic the trappings
of a workaday woman.

02:52.472 --> 02:53.939
- And if you'll notice, David,

02:53.974 --> 02:56.107
no cufflinks.
- Wow!

02:56.142 --> 02:59.077
I am blinded by
the disenfranchisement.

03:01.581 --> 03:02.914
I wouldn't be surprised
if they just gave you the car.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.784
(Spoon tapping)

03:10.490 --> 03:12.390
- Hey, sorry I'm late,

03:12.425 --> 03:14.659
there was very heavy foot
traffic on the way over.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.262
- Do you mind putting these
in Mrs. Hertzman's file?

03:17.297 --> 03:19.030
- Oh, hello!

03:19.065 --> 03:22.234
Who is this cool cat,
and what did he do with Ted?

03:22.269 --> 03:23.969
- Very funny.

03:24.004 --> 03:27.138
Unfortunately, the alternative
isn't quite so...

03:27.173 --> 03:28.607
cool.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.275
- Oh my God, what happened?

03:30.310 --> 03:32.711
Did you get in a bar fight?

03:32.746 --> 03:34.746
- Uh, you know, I'd actually
prefer not to talk about it.

03:34.781 --> 03:36.681
- Okay...

03:36.716 --> 03:38.483
- Just for the sake
of maintaining

03:38.518 --> 03:39.951
some professional boundaries.

03:39.986 --> 03:41.386
- Yeah, okay, totally.

03:44.357 --> 03:45.724
You owe someone money.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.058
- Alexis, I pay off
my credit card bills

03:47.093 --> 03:49.060
two weeks in advance,
what do you think?

03:49.095 --> 03:50.528
- Okay, then why are you being
so weird about it?

03:50.563 --> 03:53.398
- I'm not being weird...
about it.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.066
You're entitled to keep
things private from me.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.638
- Okay, fine.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.339
I know that they are for
the animals,

04:01.374 --> 04:02.974
but I find that
when I get tired,

04:03.009 --> 04:06.578
just one or two
kind of help me focus.

04:06.613 --> 04:09.781
- What are you talking about?!

04:09.816 --> 04:11.583
- Anyway, um,

04:11.618 --> 04:14.552
secret or no weird secret,

04:14.587 --> 04:16.454
we've gotta cover
that thing up.

04:18.224 --> 04:19.457
I hope you're not
into contouring,

04:19.492 --> 04:21.092
'cause it's not really my thing.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.962
(Birds chirp)

04:27.801 --> 04:30.168
- So the low energy bulbs
you installed in the bathroom,

04:30.203 --> 04:33.872
I'm finding the light to be
very harsh, and um...

04:33.907 --> 04:35.507
did someone die,

04:35.542 --> 04:38.810
or are we going through like,
a mid-life Goth phase?

04:38.845 --> 04:40.612
- Someone died.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.514
- Okay, I'm just finding
the bulbs to make my skin

04:42.549 --> 04:44.482
look very jaundice-y.

04:44.517 --> 04:47.252
- My great aunt died.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.987
- Okay, I can't tell
if we're still joking...

04:49.022 --> 04:50.488
or not?
- I'm not.

04:51.858 --> 04:54.225
- Okay, and now I can't tell
whether you're playing

04:54.260 --> 04:56.428
into the joke, or whether um...

04:56.463 --> 04:58.663
you're telling the truth.
- She was 78.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.598
- So you're not joking.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.535
Okay. Um, well first,
I'd like to apologize

05:03.570 --> 05:07.172
for everything I've said
since coming in here today.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.140
- Why, you didn't kill her.

05:09.175 --> 05:11.142
- I take it you weren't
very close.

05:11.177 --> 05:12.744
- I actually really liked her.

05:12.779 --> 05:15.613
I mean, she was a mess,
but I liked her.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.716
That's probably why
I liked her.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.718
Anyways, it turns out
I'm one of the few who did,

05:19.753 --> 05:22.420
because all of the arrangements
have fallen to me!

05:22.455 --> 05:24.489
- Oh.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.459
Um, well if you...

05:27.494 --> 05:30.662
need hel--

05:33.800 --> 05:35.734
(Clears throat)

05:35.769 --> 05:37.335
- I'd like you to finish
that sentence.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.804
- Oh! Um, I am happy to help...

05:41.274 --> 05:42.707
you in this time of need.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.943
- Thank you, as much
as I appreciate

05:44.978 --> 05:46.511
your reluctant offer,

05:46.546 --> 05:48.446
I don't think you could
handle it.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.615
This whole thing
is super depressing.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.951
- Okay, I think will be fine.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.786
So I am happy to help.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.757
That is what um, friends
say to each other, right?

06:00.560 --> 06:02.894
- Yes, it is.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.829
- Okay. Um...

06:04.864 --> 06:07.532
so I'm just gonna change
into my funeral blacks.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.502
And um, and meet you back here,
then.

06:12.238 --> 06:13.638
(Door opens, slams)

06:19.279 --> 06:20.712
(Knocking)

06:26.719 --> 06:28.920
- Oh, sorry, we don't want any.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.755
(Laughs)

06:30.790 --> 06:33.491
I'm just joking. Come on in!

06:33.526 --> 06:34.926
No, I'm not! (Laughs)

06:34.961 --> 06:37.028
Johnny: Roland!
- Just let him in, Rollie!

06:37.063 --> 06:39.264
- (Laughs) Come on in!

06:39.299 --> 06:40.698
- Thank you.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.400
Entre vous, s'il vous plait.
(Laughs)

06:42.435 --> 06:44.369
- Hi, Johnny.
- Jocelyn.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.371
- Would you like to join us
for a game of cribbage?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.872
We play every day at lunch.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.475
- That's right, and Fridays,
it's strip crib.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.510
- Well, thank God
it's not Friday.

06:52.545 --> 06:53.878
- Well, we can pretend.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.413
- Now, I'm not staying long,

06:55.448 --> 06:57.282
I just came by to borrow
some clothes.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.751
- Ah, okay.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.453
Honey, why don't you check
your closet,

07:01.488 --> 07:03.655
and see if you got anything
that Johnny can fit into.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.591
- Look, Moira and I are going
to a used car lot today,

07:06.626 --> 07:09.394
and I just need to appear
more um...

07:09.429 --> 07:11.296
- Official?

07:11.331 --> 07:13.164
- Casual. Casual.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.899
You see, I've got a closet
full of suits,

07:14.934 --> 07:17.735
but uh, I don't wanna be
taken advantage of

07:17.770 --> 07:20.505
because I'm overdressed,
I need to look like

07:20.540 --> 07:22.240
I don't have money.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.741
- But you don't have any money.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.478
- Oh, I know I don't
have any money,

07:26.513 --> 07:29.247
but I need to look like
I don't have money.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.748
- Ohhhh, okay.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.952
here's what I'm hearing
you say,

07:33.987 --> 07:36.621
what you're saying is you
wanna dress like me,

07:36.656 --> 07:40.325
because I look like I don't
have any money!

07:40.360 --> 07:41.759
- I think I misspoke.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.428
- Well, that's what I heard
out of both ears,

07:43.463 --> 07:44.762
one of them works pretty well.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.365
- I mean, anything that looks...

07:47.400 --> 07:49.334
um, hip! I need something hip.

07:49.369 --> 07:50.602
Hipper than these suits.
- Hip!

07:50.637 --> 07:52.003
Oh jeez, yeah!

07:52.038 --> 07:53.771
Now you're speaking
my language!

07:53.806 --> 07:56.374
(Laughs) Hip we can do!

07:56.409 --> 07:58.109
What do you want, uh PVC,

07:58.144 --> 07:59.777
or a Hawaiian shirt?

08:01.281 --> 08:02.747
(Car rumbles)

08:05.485 --> 08:06.684
Funeral Director: Sorry about
the mess.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.753
We're in the middle of a move.

08:10.723 --> 08:13.291
Now unfortunately,
we haven't quite found

08:13.326 --> 08:14.926
your Aunt Maureen's ashes,

08:14.961 --> 08:17.762
but we know they're here
somewhere.

08:19.065 --> 08:21.232
- Okay, well,
that's encouraging.

08:21.267 --> 08:23.434
- The problem is they all come
in from the crematorium

08:23.469 --> 08:24.869
on the same day,

08:24.904 --> 08:27.272
and sometimes,
they're not labeled.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.773
- Oh?

08:30.109 --> 08:32.277
- Is it possible someone else
picked them up?

08:32.312 --> 08:33.745
- Unlikely.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.947
- I see your great aunt
has a sister.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.982
- Yeah, they haven't spoken
in 20 years.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.585
- And a step-son.
- He's in prison.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.854
- And a cousin.
- Who's also deceased.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.926
What?
- I didn't know.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.994
That side of my family
has a bit of a reputation

08:50.029 --> 08:52.430
for conflict.
- Okay.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.365
- And philandering.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.767
And fraud.
- Yeah...

08:55.802 --> 08:57.368
- And gunplay.

08:58.905 --> 09:01.406
- Well, I'm sure her remains
will turn up.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.010
But we should talk about
urns for your aunt.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.286
- We'll just get this one,
I guess.

09:15.321 --> 09:17.822
- Well, that's the shipping
tube we pack the urns in.

09:19.692 --> 09:21.092
- Found them.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.494
They were on top
of the microwave.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.396
- Wonderful.
Oh, that reminds me.

09:25.431 --> 09:28.433
Can you get us some whitener
for the coffees?

09:28.468 --> 09:32.003
- Oh... what have I been using?

09:33.473 --> 09:35.974
- Okay, I'm gonna put that down.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.009
- And what about the service?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.813
- Well, since it's just
gonna be us attending,

09:41.848 --> 09:43.848
I think we can do without.

09:43.883 --> 09:47.452
- I see... now, I know
this may sound premature,

09:47.487 --> 09:49.821
but have the two of you
thought about the planning

09:49.856 --> 09:52.156
of your own funerals?

09:52.191 --> 09:53.658
- Okay...

09:53.693 --> 09:55.893
I think we got what
we came here for,

09:55.928 --> 09:57.862
so we-I think we can just...

09:57.897 --> 09:59.364
thank you so much.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.832
(Traffic rumbles)

10:02.101 --> 10:03.635
(Moira laughs)
- What?

10:03.670 --> 10:05.803
- Well, if I squint,

10:05.838 --> 10:07.672
I feel like I'm seeing
your rough and rugged

10:07.707 --> 10:09.507
country cousin.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.875
- Oh, and you feel confident

10:10.910 --> 10:12.443
you've hit the target
with this?!

10:12.478 --> 10:14.946
- I apprenticed costume design
under Stan LaCoulier.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.048
I'm sure he'd agree
this toggery

10:17.083 --> 10:19.517
is the perfect tribute
to the common woman.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.452
Oh, John, look.

10:21.487 --> 10:22.987
It's our car!

10:23.022 --> 10:24.989
- Well, Moira, let's not pick
the first car we see.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.991
- No, before David was born!

10:27.026 --> 10:28.593
We bought a car just like this,

10:28.628 --> 10:30.128
don't you remember?

10:30.163 --> 10:32.630
- Well, I don't remember
the "Everything Be Irie"

10:32.665 --> 10:33.998
bumper sticker.

10:34.033 --> 10:36.534
- Oh no, it's perfect!

10:36.569 --> 10:38.636
Hello!
- Moira!

10:38.671 --> 10:40.805
This car is $3,000 more
than our budget.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.373
- I'm a trained actor.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.175
A humble back story
will disabuse this man

10:44.210 --> 10:46.310
of any notion
we're too patrician.

10:46.345 --> 10:47.545
- Well, okay, but...

10:47.580 --> 10:49.580
let's start by losing words
like "patrician."

10:51.050 --> 10:52.684
- Hey folks, how we doin' today?

10:52.719 --> 10:55.119
- Oh, excited beyond compare!

10:55.154 --> 10:58.556
Yes, especially with this being
our first ever purchase

10:58.591 --> 11:00.024
of an automobile.

11:00.059 --> 11:01.893
- Yes, it's our first car,

11:01.928 --> 11:03.861
let's hope we can afford it.

11:03.896 --> 11:07.732
- Yes, my poor 'usband,
lost his job recently

11:07.767 --> 11:09.701
as a tennis pro,

11:09.736 --> 11:11.903
yes, at a public resort,
that is, yeah.

11:11.938 --> 11:14.038
- Well, let's get you folks
settled inside,

11:14.073 --> 11:15.740
we'll see what we can do.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.141
- Oh, thank you.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.976
It'll be nice to get off
the streets,

11:19.011 --> 11:21.913
and be indoors for a change,
yeah?

11:21.948 --> 11:23.448
- Moira...
- What?!

11:29.922 --> 11:32.657
Moira: The truth is that um...

11:32.692 --> 11:34.826
we've-we've struggled
with penury

11:34.861 --> 11:36.694
for quite some time now,

11:36.729 --> 11:38.563
well, just two years ago,
we were...

11:38.598 --> 11:40.531
practically 'omeless.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.367
- Where are you two from?

11:43.402 --> 11:45.737
- You know, I've been
wondering that myself.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.205
- I'm from London,

11:47.240 --> 11:49.474
I was one of two
identical twins.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.577
Tragically, I was snatched
from my crib at birth

11:52.612 --> 11:54.812
by Russian mobsters.

11:54.847 --> 11:57.014
Mhmm, they looked
at my fair skin,

11:57.049 --> 11:58.850
and my dazzling eyes,
and they said,

11:58.885 --> 12:00.818
we'll make a pretty penny
on that one,

12:00.853 --> 12:02.987
on the human black market,
we will.

12:03.022 --> 12:06.090
- And what about the twin?
- What's that, love?

12:06.125 --> 12:07.658
- Well, if you're identical,

12:07.693 --> 12:09.026
I thought you'd both
be valuable.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.895
- Yes, wouldn't you?

12:12.131 --> 12:13.798
- She wasn't born yet.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.633
Yep, she wasn't born.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.001
'til three minutes later,

12:17.036 --> 12:19.036
and the Bratva work
very quickly.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.041
- That is quite a story.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.177
- Isn't it?
(Woman clears throat)

12:27.947 --> 12:30.948
- Um, excuse me, I--
I'll be back in a moment.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.822
- I think he's buying it!

12:37.857 --> 12:39.323
- You think?

12:42.929 --> 12:44.328
(Knocking)
- Hey!

12:45.765 --> 12:47.832
These are for you.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.433
- Oh, you didn't have
to do that.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.736
- Lisa dropped them off.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.771
- Oh.
- Hey!

12:53.806 --> 12:55.740
- Don't be embarrassed.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.074
- I'm not embarrassed.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.476
- I know your little secret,

12:58.511 --> 13:00.144
and as your assistant
I will be discreet,

13:00.179 --> 13:01.879
and professional.
- What?

13:01.914 --> 13:03.114
- No one's gonna know
that you're having

13:03.149 --> 13:04.749
an adventurous little rendezvous

13:04.784 --> 13:06.717
with an apple-cheeked farmwoman!

13:06.752 --> 13:08.753
- But that's not what happened!

13:08.788 --> 13:10.288
- Wink.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.090
- (Sighs)

13:13.125 --> 13:15.927
I was making a house call
to Lisa's farm,

13:15.962 --> 13:18.129
and got...

13:18.164 --> 13:20.631
head-butted by her goat.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.135
- Is that when one of you
is on the floor,

13:24.170 --> 13:25.770
and then the other one
kind of just like hops--

13:25.805 --> 13:27.305
- No, uh...

13:27.340 --> 13:29.907
I was head-butted
by an actual goat.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.676
And as a vet,
that's not something

13:31.711 --> 13:34.011
that I want getting out,
so please don't be thinking

13:34.046 --> 13:35.446
that this is something
that it isn't.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.082
- Okay. Sorry.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.988
Those are delicious,
by the way.

13:44.023 --> 13:45.990
She practically begged me
to try one.

13:46.025 --> 13:48.125
So... I did.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.162
And I also took a couple
for David.

13:54.433 --> 13:56.567
- Um, yeah, you're right,
this is a bit depressing.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.202
Are we sure this
is the right place?

13:58.237 --> 13:59.637
- She was very specific

13:59.672 --> 14:01.372
about where she wanted
to be scattered.

14:01.407 --> 14:02.673
- Um, so what are...

14:04.176 --> 14:05.509
where-how--
where should we do...

14:05.544 --> 14:06.944
- Well, I don't want
people parking on her!

14:06.979 --> 14:08.646
- Okay.
- So...

14:10.216 --> 14:11.649
Maybe I could just put her
on the grass over there?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.150
- Sure.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.219
- (Sighs) <u>- Ooh, it
smells</u> like cigarettes.

14:15.254 --> 14:17.154
- Ohhh...
- Um...

14:17.189 --> 14:19.323
do we scatter it all,
or do we...

14:19.358 --> 14:21.859
save some for later?
- Later?!

14:21.894 --> 14:24.395
- I don't know!
- (Sighs heavily)

14:26.999 --> 14:28.399
This is gonna be me.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.801
- Well, theoretically,
it's gonna be all of us.

14:30.836 --> 14:32.136
Um, although I'm hoping
that when I pass,

14:32.171 --> 14:34.372
there'll be a little
more fanfare.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.841
- My great aunt worked
at the motel.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.010
Front desk.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.046
- You never told me that.
- Yep.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.982
So I just need to take up
palm reading,

14:45.017 --> 14:46.717
get a few cats,

14:46.752 --> 14:48.085
move to Saskatchewan.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.754
- Well, a girl could dream.

14:52.591 --> 14:55.092
You are not your aunt!

14:55.127 --> 14:56.427
From what I've heard,
I wouldn't be friends with her,

14:56.462 --> 14:58.462
and I'm friends with you,
so that's one major difference.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.033
She made her decisions.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.401
And you're going to make yours,

15:03.436 --> 15:05.102
and they are going
to be different.

15:05.137 --> 15:07.405
And they are going to be great.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.241
And if they're not,
I'll be sure to scatter

15:10.276 --> 15:12.143
your ashes in a much nicer
parking lot.

15:12.178 --> 15:13.678
- I think I'm just gonna start
pouring, okay?

15:13.713 --> 15:15.112
- Okay, so-- - Okay.
- Not here, though!

15:15.147 --> 15:17.281
Let's go just... over there.

15:17.316 --> 15:19.050
- Thank you very much
for waiting.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.252
- Oh.
- This is Sarah,

15:21.287 --> 15:23.087
this is my wife,
and business partner.

15:23.122 --> 15:25.623
- Oh hi, is everything okay?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.658
- Well, I hope you can
forgive me,

15:27.693 --> 15:30.461
but I couldn't help
overhear your story.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.263
- Oh yes, love,

15:32.298 --> 15:34.799
it's an inspiration to many,
I'm sure.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.034
- And it sounded so familiar.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.869
But then I remembered...

15:38.904 --> 15:41.072
"Sunrise Bay!"

15:41.107 --> 15:43.240
- My wife was addicted
to your show!

15:43.275 --> 15:46.043
- Well, I find it's wonderful,

15:46.078 --> 15:47.812
but we don't have
a television, so.

15:47.847 --> 15:50.681
- Moira...
- I remember when your twin showed up,

15:50.716 --> 15:53.718
and stabbed Armand
with her sharpened crutch.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.953
- Okay, look folks,
I'm really sorry,

15:55.988 --> 15:58.055
my wife was simply...

15:58.090 --> 16:00.024
trying to fictionalize

16:00.059 --> 16:02.026
our very real financial
struggle.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.427
- Okay, that was fun.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.929
- There's no need
to be embarrassed.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.964
We read all about what
happened to you,

16:06.999 --> 16:09.300
losing everything.
- It's heartbreaking.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.802
- We didn't lose everything.
- Well...

16:11.837 --> 16:13.771
- Seeing you working so hard,

16:13.806 --> 16:15.573
just to shave a few bucks
off that Lincoln,

16:15.608 --> 16:17.675
which we could do.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.777
- But now you're making it
sound like some...

16:19.812 --> 16:22.380
act of desperation,
it was simply just an act.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.016
- Um Moira, they're just
trying to help us out

16:25.051 --> 16:26.884
by giving us a better price.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.285
- Well, nonsense, dear,

16:28.320 --> 16:30.221
we can certainly pay
full freight.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.790
You save that discount
for someone who needs it!

16:32.825 --> 16:34.392
- Yes, okay. Dear, look.

16:34.427 --> 16:38.462
We really would appreciate
any financial assistance.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.298
- Or perhaps we might have
to take our business

16:41.333 --> 16:44.268
to a dealership that sells
brand new cars.

16:44.303 --> 16:45.970
- As you can see,
we can't even afford

16:46.005 --> 16:48.305
her meds right now.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.374
- I'll get the paperwork
started.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.745
- Here we go, dear,
here's the chair.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.616
(Birds chirp)

17:02.655 --> 17:04.855
- Hey, so I'm headed out,

17:04.890 --> 17:07.358
and I will drop off the flea
shampoo for Ms. Warner's cat.

17:07.393 --> 17:10.261
- Sorry, what did
Mrs. Warner say?

17:10.296 --> 17:12.530
- She called to ask if you
would drop off flea shampoo,

17:12.565 --> 17:14.432
and she also asked
if you would wash her cat,

17:14.467 --> 17:17.301
but I said that
you were too busy.

17:17.336 --> 17:20.171
- Oh. Y-yeah. Uh okay,
you know what,

17:20.206 --> 17:22.473
I got this.
- I'm happy to do it.

17:22.508 --> 17:25.910
Um... do we even have
flea shampoo?

17:25.945 --> 17:28.112
- Uh, it's fine, I-I'll do it.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.680
It's best if I do it.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.082
- No, it's on my way home,

17:31.117 --> 17:33.617
and I rarely offer to do
things like this, so.

17:33.652 --> 17:35.352
- (Sighs)

17:35.387 --> 17:38.589
Heather Warner doesn't
actually have a cat.

17:38.624 --> 17:40.257
- Ohhh.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.627
She like, thinks she has a cat?

17:43.662 --> 17:44.862
That's so sad.

17:46.432 --> 17:49.233
But I guess she is like 50,
so that makes sense.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.035
- Yep, she's 42.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.803
And she's not crazy.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.840
It's code.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.578
- (Laughs quizzically)

18:00.613 --> 18:03.981
- I'm kind of seeing Heather,
and the flea shampoo is...

18:04.016 --> 18:05.416
- A booty call?!

18:05.451 --> 18:07.084
- Well, I'm not crazy about
the term, but--

18:07.119 --> 18:09.587
- Ted, look at you,
Little Sexy Susan!

18:09.622 --> 18:11.789
- Okay, calling me "Susan"
kinda takes the sexy out of it.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.491
But I'm glad we were able
to deal with this

18:13.526 --> 18:15.192
in a professional manner.

18:15.227 --> 18:17.561
- Ted, say hi to her cat
for me.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.963
- That's too far, Alexis!
(Alexis laughs)

18:25.004 --> 18:26.871
- To Maureen Budd,

18:26.906 --> 18:30.875
and not following too closely
in her footsteps.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.412
- So we're drinking to me
not becoming an alcoholic?

18:35.447 --> 18:37.047
- Mhmm.

18:37.082 --> 18:39.583
(Clinks)
- Off to a good start.

18:43.088 --> 18:45.322
- Hi, I'm looking
for Stevie Budd.

18:45.357 --> 18:47.591
- I'm her.
- Hi, we spoke on the phone,

18:47.626 --> 18:49.894
I'm Elaine,
from West, Read and Healy.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.896
I have some personal effects
that were willed to you,

18:51.931 --> 18:54.598
- Oh... - and some
documents for you to sign.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.300
- Thanks.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.436
- Oh my God.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.705
When did you have
this photo taken?

19:01.740 --> 19:03.607
- That's not me.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.843
That's Maureen.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.112
- Mmm.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.947
- Okay, well,
just because you bear

19:09.982 --> 19:12.116
a vague physical resemblance,

19:12.151 --> 19:14.151
does not mean that you...

19:14.186 --> 19:17.421
will end up in an apartment
with newspaper for curtains.

19:17.456 --> 19:20.391
Okay, this is not
going to be you.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.494
- What is this?

19:23.529 --> 19:26.463
- That is the deed
to the motel.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.765
- Sorry?

19:29.235 --> 19:31.569
- Maureen Budd owned the motel.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.071
- You didn't tell me that.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.539
- Nobody told me that.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.174
I mean, I knew it was
in the family,

19:37.209 --> 19:39.376
but I didn't know
she outright owned it.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.380
Was she of sound mind?

19:43.415 --> 19:45.216
- Uh well,
according to her will,

19:45.251 --> 19:47.351
she wanted you to have it.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.522
- Was she of sound mind?!

19:55.060 --> 19:56.660
- Okay, this still doesn't mean

19:56.695 --> 19:59.163
that you are going to be
anything like her!

19:59.198 --> 20:00.931
I mean sure, on the surface,

20:00.966 --> 20:03.500
it is a step in that direction,
but, you know,

20:03.535 --> 20:05.469
um, okay, you know what?

20:05.504 --> 20:07.404
Let's clear some of this stuff.
- Yeah.

20:07.439 --> 20:09.173
- Starting with the urn.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.508
And I'm-we're gonna just...

20:14.079 --> 20:15.512
(Horn honks)

20:15.547 --> 20:17.748
(Engine idles, shuts off)

20:21.487 --> 20:23.454
(Door slams, keys jingle)

20:24.823 --> 20:26.590
- You look like a contestant
on "The Price Is Right."

20:26.625 --> 20:30.594
- Well, it worked,
because the price was right.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.496
- How much did you pay for this?

20:32.531 --> 20:34.031
- David, it's not polite to ask

20:34.066 --> 20:35.366
what you paid for something.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.434
- It says $7,250 right there.

20:37.469 --> 20:38.802
- Well, that's way over budget!

20:38.837 --> 20:40.738
- Well, that's not what
we paid for it.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.239
- Well, what did you pay
for it?!

20:42.274 --> 20:43.707
- $6,000 quid, love.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.509
- Oh God!
- Thank you, Moira.

20:45.544 --> 20:46.877
And it would've been a lot less,

20:46.912 --> 20:48.579
if your mother hadn't talked
them back up!

20:48.614 --> 20:50.547
- You can't put a price
on dignity.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.250
- Uh, tell that to your outfit.

20:53.285 --> 20:54.685
- This is your outfit.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.620
- What?!
- Okay, look.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.223
The important thing is,
we now have a car!

20:59.258 --> 21:01.258
- Is this a car
for dead people?

21:01.293 --> 21:02.993
- No, it's not a hearse!

21:03.028 --> 21:05.696
- Look, this is a used car,
so it's not perfect.

21:05.731 --> 21:07.464
- Were all the other cars
on fire, then?

21:11.770 --> 21:13.103
It's very big.
