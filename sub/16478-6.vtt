WEBVTT

00:06.451 --> 00:09.318
(muffled yelling)
You lied to me.

00:11.723 --> 00:13.455
(muffled yelling)

00:13.457 --> 00:15.557
MAN (distantly):
Somebody's giving me two!

00:15.559 --> 00:17.826
Who's ringing my bell?

00:17.828 --> 00:19.227
You?

00:19.229 --> 00:20.228
Master Chief!

00:20.230 --> 00:21.897
Not that easy by a long shot.

00:21.899 --> 00:22.998
(shouts)

00:23.000 --> 00:26.167
MASTER CHIEF:
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:26.169 --> 00:27.569
(muffled grunting)

00:27.571 --> 00:29.437
I need two!

00:29.864 --> 00:30.672
Get me out of here!

00:30.673 --> 00:32.307
You want to be a Navy
SEAL or don't you?

00:32.308 --> 00:33.808
What the hell's wrong with you,
Marchand?

00:33.810 --> 00:35.676
Leave those bindings
and get back in.

00:35.678 --> 00:37.178
I'm not getting back
in the water!

00:37.180 --> 00:38.379
You quitting on me, sailor?

00:38.381 --> 00:39.981
Huh? You gonna
ring the bell?

00:39.983 --> 00:41.649
I'm sorry. I can't, sir.

00:41.651 --> 00:43.184
- I can't!
- Damn it!

00:43.186 --> 00:45.119
Get back here,
you son of a bitch!

01:19.287 --> 01:20.852
Yes.

01:20.854 --> 01:22.220
By the way,
your mom ever whip up

01:22.222 --> 01:23.488
any of your favorite meals

01:23.490 --> 01:25.490
when you were on
your wilderness adventure?

01:25.492 --> 01:26.858
Oh, now, Dwayne,
you do recall,

01:26.860 --> 01:29.460
I did buy a brand-new
cookstove for the trip.

01:29.462 --> 01:30.661
Never made it out
the box, though.

01:30.663 --> 01:33.198
(Pride chuckles)
Oh, hush, kid.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.267
Microwaves were
invented for a reason.

01:35.269 --> 01:37.001
Yeah, well,
good a time as any

01:37.003 --> 01:38.668
to learn how to prepare
your own meals, Danny.

01:38.670 --> 01:40.704
Heading to college,

01:40.706 --> 01:42.273
winter semester.

01:42.275 --> 01:43.573
You gonna be taking the
cookstove, too, ain't ya?

01:43.575 --> 01:46.076
Oh, I'm not sure they
allow those

01:46.078 --> 01:48.012
in the dorms at UNO, but...

01:48.014 --> 01:49.646
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh... (clears throat)

01:49.648 --> 01:51.048
Not gonna be in the dorms.

01:51.050 --> 01:52.049
Oh?

01:52.051 --> 01:54.083
You staying home?

01:54.085 --> 01:55.618
It's the first
I've ever heard of it.

01:55.620 --> 01:58.554
(Pride chuckles)
No, I mean, um,

01:58.556 --> 02:00.823
I'm not gonna be at UNO.

02:00.825 --> 02:03.359
I've, uh, decided
to join the Navy.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.799
Since when?

02:09.800 --> 02:11.032
Couple weeks now.

02:11.035 --> 02:12.401
Um, I spoke to a recruiter.

02:12.403 --> 02:13.768
He talked me
through the details,

02:13.770 --> 02:16.538
and, um, there's a lot of
options I like.

02:19.009 --> 02:21.743
Well, that-that is...

02:23.547 --> 02:26.481
(chuckling):
...some big news, huh, Loretta?

02:27.551 --> 02:28.715
And, you know,

02:28.717 --> 02:31.152
can't do any better
than the Navy.

02:31.154 --> 02:32.553
(phone rings)
Uh,

02:32.555 --> 02:33.921
excuse me.

02:33.923 --> 02:35.389
(phone ringing)

02:35.391 --> 02:38.792
Uh... I-I... I got to take this.

02:38.794 --> 02:40.061
Sorry.

02:40.063 --> 02:42.296
(phone beeps)
Pride here.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.700
Got it.

02:47.702 --> 02:49.569
Heading over.

02:49.571 --> 02:51.471
(phone beeps)
Danny?

02:51.473 --> 02:53.706
Sorry to steal your
thunder, here, but, uh,

02:53.708 --> 02:57.877
dead sailor by
Gretna ferry landing.

02:57.879 --> 02:59.712
Kit's in the car.

02:59.714 --> 03:01.948
I'll meet you there.

03:01.950 --> 03:03.782
We'll discuss this later.

03:12.259 --> 03:13.825
(ship horn blows)

03:13.827 --> 03:17.196
Our victim is
Petty Officer Corey Marchand.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.497
Navy SEAL candidate training

03:18.499 --> 03:21.065
at that new pilot
program at Stennis.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.934
He's due to graduate
in a couple of weeks.

03:23.936 --> 03:25.970
His wallet and keys
are still here,

03:25.972 --> 03:27.071
but his phone is gone.

03:27.073 --> 03:28.239
(camera shutter clicking)

03:28.241 --> 03:29.307
PRIDE:
Not easy taking down a SEAL,

03:29.309 --> 03:30.541
even a pup.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.742
You can take down
pretty much anyone

03:31.744 --> 03:32.977
with a bullet to the head.

03:32.979 --> 03:34.845
(camera shutter clicking)

03:34.847 --> 03:36.679
Looks like a dump job,

03:36.681 --> 03:38.281
judging from the lack of blood.

03:38.283 --> 03:40.017
Why don't you let me examine him

03:40.019 --> 03:41.451
before we jump to conclusions?

03:42.521 --> 03:43.653
Just sayin'.

03:43.655 --> 03:44.954
Nonetheless.

03:44.956 --> 03:46.323
You might want
to check his wrists,

03:46.325 --> 03:47.491
looks like he was bound.

03:47.493 --> 03:48.691
(camera shutter clicking)

03:48.693 --> 03:50.994
Thank you.

03:50.996 --> 03:52.996
(ship horn blows)

03:57.668 --> 03:58.767
Is she okay?

03:58.769 --> 03:59.968
PRIDE:
She's fine.

03:59.970 --> 04:00.969
Any witnesses?

04:00.971 --> 04:02.604
Canvassed the area--
nothing.

04:02.606 --> 04:05.674
(phone rings)
Oh.

04:05.676 --> 04:08.144
If Marchand's still in training,
he's a long way from Stennis.

04:08.146 --> 04:09.445
Day off?

04:09.447 --> 04:12.213
SEALs trainees
don't take days off.

04:12.215 --> 04:13.614
(phone rings)

04:13.616 --> 04:14.208
Ah.

04:14.232 --> 04:16.185
BUDS training
is 24 weeks of hell.

04:16.185 --> 04:17.152
BUDS?

04:17.154 --> 04:19.320
Basic Underwater Demolition.
SEALs.

04:19.322 --> 04:21.322
Convoluted acronym,
if you ask me.

04:21.324 --> 04:23.091
(phone rings)
Ah.

04:23.093 --> 04:25.393
You need to get that,
Christopher?

04:25.395 --> 04:26.627
No, sir, I'm good.

04:26.629 --> 04:27.894
Sorry about that.
Okay.

04:27.896 --> 04:29.396
SONJA:
Hey, just spoke to

04:29.398 --> 04:30.964
Command's Master at Arms
at Stennis.

04:30.966 --> 04:34.101
Petty Officer Marchand's
been UA for 24 hours.

04:34.103 --> 04:35.869
Marchand sneaks to NOLA,

04:35.871 --> 04:37.237
gets more than
he bargained for?

04:37.239 --> 04:38.738
Marchand's two weeks
from graduating,

04:38.740 --> 04:40.407
don't think he's gonna
risk it all

04:40.409 --> 04:41.741
for a night on the town.

04:41.743 --> 04:43.310
I would have given anything
to play hooky

04:43.312 --> 04:44.477
my last days at Quantico.

04:44.479 --> 04:46.145
Well, SEALs
are different.

04:46.147 --> 04:48.847
I don't think he was
joining the SEALs, Dwayne.

04:48.849 --> 04:50.316
Transfer papers,

04:50.318 --> 04:51.517
dated today.

04:51.519 --> 04:52.952
He was quitting SEALs.

04:52.954 --> 04:55.588
Well, if Marchand was
fixing to tap out,

04:55.590 --> 04:57.457
why sneak off the day before?

04:57.459 --> 05:01.359
Well, I guess we're
going to Stennis to find out.

05:05.499 --> 05:07.199
Petty Officer Marchand
was a good sailor.

05:07.201 --> 05:08.733
Top of his class,
a damn shame.

05:08.735 --> 05:10.202
If Marchand was so good,

05:10.204 --> 05:11.703
why'd he have
the transfer papers?

05:11.705 --> 05:13.472
60% of candidates won't make it.

05:13.474 --> 05:15.073
Most times, you can tell
who'll ring the bell

05:15.075 --> 05:16.174
the day they arrive.

05:16.176 --> 05:17.375
Other times, it's a mystery.

05:17.377 --> 05:19.009
The mystery is:

05:19.011 --> 05:22.346
why did Marchand go UA without
getting his papers signed?

05:22.348 --> 05:24.281
Was he in some kind of trouble
recently?

05:24.283 --> 05:25.416
MASTER CHIEF: Don't allow
trouble in SEALs training.

05:25.418 --> 05:26.417
SONJA (scoffs):
Come on, Chief.

05:26.419 --> 05:27.551
Bunch of young guys

05:27.553 --> 05:28.952
cooped up together for weeks.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.387
Sometimes trouble
happens, right?

05:30.389 --> 05:32.156
Not here, not
these young guys.

05:32.158 --> 05:34.925
No doubt you run a tight ship,
but we found

05:34.927 --> 05:36.959
these marks
on Marchand's wrists.

05:38.029 --> 05:39.229
Drownproofing.

05:39.231 --> 05:40.463
Sailors execute a series

05:40.465 --> 05:42.565
of underwater maneuvers
with their arms and legs bound.

05:42.567 --> 05:44.567
Oh, that sounds
like torture to me.

05:44.569 --> 05:46.002
No, it's training.
For a SEAL, getting over

05:46.004 --> 05:47.437
the instinctual fear of drowning
is critical.

05:47.439 --> 05:48.671
That's right.

05:48.673 --> 05:50.406
And frankly,
Marchand was struggling.

05:51.510 --> 05:52.707
I thought you said
he was top of his class?

05:52.709 --> 05:54.343
He was,
in every other regard.

05:54.345 --> 05:56.011
But you fail drownproofing,
you wash out.

05:56.013 --> 05:58.013
What, a Navy SEAL
can't have a bad day?

05:58.015 --> 06:00.315
When they do, people die, ma'am.

06:01.051 --> 06:02.584
You saying he rang the bell?

06:02.586 --> 06:04.153
No, sir. Not in front of me.
I sent him

06:04.155 --> 06:05.554
back to the barracks
to pull himself together.

06:05.556 --> 06:07.556
Yeah, but weren't you
kind of curious

06:07.558 --> 06:09.157
where he was the last day
and a half?

06:09.159 --> 06:10.924
Got 50 living
sailors, ma'am.

06:10.926 --> 06:12.960
Not a lot of time
for curiosity.

06:12.962 --> 06:14.328
(talking quietly)

06:14.330 --> 06:16.264
Now, if you'll
excuse me.

06:20.936 --> 06:22.537
You getting the
feeling I'm getting?

06:22.539 --> 06:24.004
Yeah.

06:24.006 --> 06:26.739
He's hiding something.

06:26.741 --> 06:28.341
(jet engines roaring)

06:28.343 --> 06:29.842
Your phone's been
blowing up all morning.

06:29.844 --> 06:31.077
What gives?

06:31.079 --> 06:32.312
Just an old friend.

06:32.314 --> 06:34.781
By old friend,
you mean former hook up?

06:34.783 --> 06:36.283
Where'd you get that from?

06:36.285 --> 06:38.885
You didn't save her number
in your contacts.

06:38.887 --> 06:41.354
Well, maybe she changed
phones recently.

06:41.356 --> 06:42.822
Oh, so she is
a former hook up.

06:42.824 --> 06:45.324
And judging from the 15 texts
on the ride up,

06:45.326 --> 06:47.326
I'm assuming she doesn't
take no for an answer.

06:47.328 --> 06:49.127
- You done?
- For now.

06:50.198 --> 06:51.797
Petty Officer Hollister?

06:51.799 --> 06:53.965
You Corey Marchand's roommate?

06:53.967 --> 06:55.801
Yes, ma'am.

06:55.803 --> 06:57.803
Any clue why he went UA?

06:57.805 --> 06:59.738
No, ma'am.

07:06.313 --> 07:10.448
Marchand still has
his civies here.

07:10.450 --> 07:12.283
If he was putting in
his transfer papers,

07:12.285 --> 07:13.318
why didn't he pack?

07:13.320 --> 07:14.852
No, Corey,
he-he tried to pack.

07:14.854 --> 07:15.853
He was stopped.

07:15.855 --> 07:17.487
Stopped by who?

07:18.357 --> 07:19.623
Hey.

07:19.625 --> 07:21.925
Hey.

07:21.927 --> 07:23.159
(whispers):
If you saw something,

07:23.161 --> 07:24.761
you need to say something.

07:24.763 --> 07:26.330
Ma'am, I still have
to survive here.

07:26.332 --> 07:27.698
Well, your best friend Corey,

07:27.700 --> 07:29.199
he didn't survive.

07:30.168 --> 07:32.369
You know,
I just keep my head down.

07:32.371 --> 07:34.170
I don't know anything.

07:35.005 --> 07:36.539
SEALs aren't about

07:36.541 --> 07:38.407
keeping their heads down.

07:39.210 --> 07:41.009
They look out
for their brothers.

07:41.011 --> 07:43.045
Who wouldn't let him pack?

07:48.018 --> 07:50.586
Look...

07:50.588 --> 07:52.186
it was the drownproofing.

07:52.188 --> 07:53.054
The what now?

07:53.056 --> 07:54.556
I'll explain it to you later.

07:54.558 --> 07:55.523
What happened?

07:55.525 --> 07:57.425
Corey freaked out.

07:57.427 --> 08:00.027
He was, uh...

08:00.029 --> 08:03.030
he was ready
to ring the bell...

08:03.032 --> 08:06.134
and then Master Chief Jolly
went off on him.

08:06.136 --> 08:07.736
He wouldn't let him
ring that bell?

08:07.738 --> 08:09.703
He followed Corey back here.

08:09.705 --> 08:11.772
He refused to let him leave.

08:11.774 --> 08:14.141
And then he forced him
back to the pool,

08:14.143 --> 08:15.576
just the two of them.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.210
Told Corey that he would

08:17.212 --> 08:19.880
pass drownproofing
or die trying.

08:19.882 --> 08:21.548
He took it like it was personal.

08:21.550 --> 08:22.750
How do you know he said that

08:22.752 --> 08:23.884
if it was just the two of them?

08:23.886 --> 08:26.486
Because I followed them.

08:26.488 --> 08:28.721
And I recorded everything.

08:40.467 --> 08:43.735
(Marchand yelling)

08:43.736 --> 08:45.370
Please, sir. Please!

08:45.372 --> 08:49.374
Turn around and give me
your damn arms, sailor!

08:49.376 --> 08:51.410
Looks personal to me.

09:06.055 --> 09:07.588
Please!
- Turn around,

09:07.590 --> 09:10.291
and give me your damn arms,
sailor!

09:10.293 --> 09:11.392
(tablet beeps)

09:11.394 --> 09:12.625
PRIDE: You want explain
what we just watched?

09:12.627 --> 09:14.961
It's called EMI.

09:14.963 --> 09:16.028
Extra Military
Instruction.

09:16.030 --> 09:17.029
A common practice.

09:17.031 --> 09:18.965
Does it usually end
with a dead sailor

09:18.967 --> 09:20.133
found by the river?

09:20.135 --> 09:21.534
Not usually.

09:21.536 --> 09:24.237
You understand,

09:24.239 --> 09:26.139
this video brings up questions.

09:26.141 --> 09:28.108
Yeah, like why you
lied about seeing Marchand

09:28.110 --> 09:29.441
after drownproofing.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.643
I didn't kill
Petty Officer Marchand,

09:31.645 --> 09:33.545
if that's what
you're implying.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.884
Chief Jolly,

09:39.886 --> 09:41.987
you take pride in your work.

09:41.989 --> 09:42.988
(chair slides out)

09:42.990 --> 09:44.656
Guiding young men
to become

09:44.658 --> 09:47.425
elite fighters.

09:47.427 --> 09:48.826
Yes, I do, sir.

09:48.828 --> 09:51.229
We take pride in our work, too.

09:53.566 --> 09:57.201
Right now, that means
getting justice for Marchand.

09:57.203 --> 09:58.902
We need your help.

10:02.242 --> 10:03.540
I was trying to help him.

10:03.542 --> 10:05.408
By tying him up,
humiliating him?

10:05.410 --> 10:07.511
By making him face his fears.

10:07.513 --> 10:09.546
I believed he can overcome them.

10:10.682 --> 10:12.115
For most, it's drowning.

10:12.117 --> 10:14.083
But for Marchand,
he was in a panic

10:14.085 --> 10:15.318
as soon as he saw the ropes.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.387
What happened
after the recording?

10:17.389 --> 10:19.256
I untied him.

10:19.258 --> 10:21.590
I told him to deal with
whatever was eating him

10:21.592 --> 10:23.392
and if he still wanted to
ring the bell in the morning,

10:23.394 --> 10:24.660
I'd let him.

10:24.662 --> 10:27.396
But he disappeared after that.

10:32.403 --> 10:34.470
Something was haunting that kid.

10:34.472 --> 10:37.372
I thought I was
helping him, but...

10:37.374 --> 10:41.108
but maybe I just
pushed him too far.

10:49.452 --> 10:52.353
(door opens, closes)

10:52.355 --> 10:54.988
Come on, you're not buying
this crying-on-the-inside act.

10:54.990 --> 10:56.956
I don't feel like it's an act.

10:56.958 --> 10:59.125
One of his men is dead.

10:59.127 --> 11:00.494
Jolly feels responsible.

11:00.496 --> 11:02.128
I don't, I don't think
he pulled the trigger.

11:02.130 --> 11:03.430
Yeah, but it wouldn't be
the first time

11:03.432 --> 11:05.332
an instructor went overboard.

11:05.334 --> 11:06.533
Not like this.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.502
And we still
don't have a motive.

11:08.504 --> 11:11.437
All we do know is that
Marchand left base...

11:11.439 --> 11:13.639
24 hours later he was dead.

11:15.276 --> 11:17.577
Check Jolly's alibi to be sure.

11:17.579 --> 11:19.679
I'll find out what
Lasalle and Gregorio

11:19.681 --> 11:21.681
have learned about Marchand.

11:23.117 --> 11:26.151
GREGORIO: Only child, struggling
single mom who died last year

11:26.153 --> 11:27.820
when he was a senior
in high school.

11:27.822 --> 11:29.487
He had something going
for him, though, King.

11:29.489 --> 11:32.257
He was tall, fast
and he was good at the post.

11:32.259 --> 11:35.126
Lafitte High School basketball,
some of the best in the state.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.229
A huge feeder
into the NCAA.

11:37.231 --> 11:40.398
Even with that pool of talent,
Marchand was an up-and-comer.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.100
I mean, I saw
the kid play.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.468
He was...
he was good.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.203
But he didn't take
the college scholarship,

11:45.205 --> 11:46.370
joined the Navy,

11:46.372 --> 11:48.004
qualified for SEAL training.

11:48.006 --> 11:50.274
Kid played at an elite level.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.975
Trained to be the best
of the best.

11:51.977 --> 11:52.943
(phone ringing)

11:52.945 --> 11:54.678
Got derailed, though.

11:59.285 --> 12:00.917
Something I should know
about, Christopher?

12:00.919 --> 12:02.985
LASALLE: Nah, I'll take
care of it, King.

12:05.156 --> 12:07.857
Nothing in Marchand's history
gets him killed.

12:07.859 --> 12:09.325
(phone beeps)

12:09.327 --> 12:11.160
Need to know where he went
after he left base.

12:11.162 --> 12:13.529
Yeah, we're pulling
his credit card statement

12:13.531 --> 12:14.530
of the last two days.

12:14.532 --> 12:15.998
Good.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.368
Loretta finished her autopsy.

12:19.370 --> 12:20.969
I'll go see her.

12:20.971 --> 12:23.338
You two
follow that credit card trial.

12:23.340 --> 12:25.173
Learn things.

12:25.175 --> 12:27.409
Okay.

12:30.447 --> 12:33.448
Man, I have never seen
radiographs like this before.

12:33.450 --> 12:38.118
Marchand's lung capacity
is two times a normal male's.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.154
I get winded when
I run up the stairs.

12:40.156 --> 12:42.089
He was an athlete, Sebastian.

12:42.091 --> 12:43.157
Yeah, you're telling me.

12:43.159 --> 12:45.058
I-I did a rough calculation.

12:45.060 --> 12:48.596
He's got to be nearly
46% muscle mass.

12:48.598 --> 12:51.465
I'm... maybe 25.

12:51.467 --> 12:53.833
If you count sinew,
which, you know...

12:53.835 --> 12:54.834
a lot of people don't.

12:54.836 --> 12:56.803
Are you here for a reason?

12:56.805 --> 12:59.071
Um, you said that you had
stomach contents for me.

12:59.073 --> 13:00.707
So... here I am.

13:00.709 --> 13:02.742
On the counter.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.316
Hey, Sebastian.
- Hey.

13:10.318 --> 13:11.483
Whatever you do,

13:11.485 --> 13:13.118
don't bring up
physiology, okay?

13:13.120 --> 13:14.586
She's not in the mood.

13:18.526 --> 13:19.692
What do you got, Loretta?

13:19.694 --> 13:20.959
Cause of death

13:20.961 --> 13:22.661
for Petty Officer Marchand

13:22.663 --> 13:24.496
is a single gunshot to the head.

13:24.498 --> 13:26.799
Stippling indicates
close contact.

13:26.801 --> 13:28.633
Also, signs of tendinitis,

13:28.635 --> 13:30.368
shoulder separation,

13:30.370 --> 13:32.337
tibia stress fractures.

13:32.339 --> 13:36.040
Not uncommon, considering the
intensity of his SEAL training.

13:36.042 --> 13:38.209
He had his whole life
ahead of him.

13:38.211 --> 13:40.110
Look at him.

13:40.112 --> 13:41.612
It's a waste.

13:45.651 --> 13:48.418
What are we talking about here,
Loretta?

13:50.956 --> 13:54.658
Danny was accepted to college.

13:54.660 --> 13:55.792
We put away money.

13:55.794 --> 13:56.893
You helped.

13:56.895 --> 13:58.562
Nothing wrong
with wanting to serve.

13:58.564 --> 13:59.996
No, there's nothing
wrong with that,

13:59.998 --> 14:02.531
but he's already survived
a hard life.

14:02.533 --> 14:05.468
I was hoping his future
would be a little easier.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.135
You can't keep him in a bubble.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.804
We had a plan.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.105
Plans change.

14:10.107 --> 14:12.375
Not this one.

14:12.377 --> 14:14.577
When Laurel wanted
to quit school,

14:14.579 --> 14:16.044
you remember
what you said to me?

14:16.046 --> 14:18.546
“Get out of
your own way.

14:18.548 --> 14:20.682
Hear her out.”
- Yeah.

14:20.684 --> 14:22.784
But she didn't drop out.

14:22.786 --> 14:25.152
And Danny's a different child.

14:25.154 --> 14:26.921
He's not a child.

14:26.923 --> 14:28.122
He's a young man.

14:28.124 --> 14:31.125
Too young to make this decision.

14:31.127 --> 14:34.562
Look, he looks up to you.

14:34.564 --> 14:38.331
Can't you convince him
to change his mind?

14:39.702 --> 14:42.235
Dwayne, please.

14:46.341 --> 14:48.174
Need a hand?

14:48.176 --> 14:50.043
Thank you.

14:50.045 --> 14:52.379
Got it.

14:52.381 --> 14:53.813
Sorry we had to run out.

14:53.815 --> 14:55.548
Yeah, not so sure I am.

14:55.550 --> 14:57.817
Mom seemed
kind of pissed.

14:57.819 --> 14:59.051
She asked you
to come by

14:59.053 --> 15:00.386
and talk me
out of it, right?

15:00.388 --> 15:01.987
She just wants me
to talk to you, Danny.

15:01.989 --> 15:05.257
Yeah, we both know
that's not how she put it.

15:05.259 --> 15:06.859
She cares about you.

15:06.861 --> 15:08.594
She thinks I'm being impulsive.

15:08.596 --> 15:10.328
Like I haven't thought
it through.

15:10.330 --> 15:11.430
Have you?

15:11.432 --> 15:13.665
A week ago, you were

15:13.667 --> 15:15.133
picking classes,
thinking about trying out

15:15.135 --> 15:16.668
for the baseball team.
Yeah, because I knew

15:16.670 --> 15:18.202
that's what she wanted.

15:18.204 --> 15:20.872
I just couldn't work up
the nerve to say what I want.

15:22.342 --> 15:24.075
All I want to do is serve...

15:24.077 --> 15:25.710
like Mom, like you.

15:26.546 --> 15:27.812
Just do it on my own.

15:27.814 --> 15:29.747
Yeah. Nothing wrong
with having help.

15:29.749 --> 15:31.882
You've helped enough.

15:31.884 --> 15:33.617
This is the path that I want.

15:35.521 --> 15:39.423
Sounds like you have
thought it out.

15:39.425 --> 15:41.592
You should, uh...

15:41.594 --> 15:43.260
explain it to your mom.

15:43.262 --> 15:46.563
Yeah, um...
about that.

15:46.565 --> 15:48.397
I was kind of hoping you would.

15:48.399 --> 15:49.466
Oh...

15:49.468 --> 15:50.600
Look, when I speak,

15:50.602 --> 15:52.301
all she hears
is a little kid.

15:52.303 --> 15:53.636
Okay? She respects you.

15:53.638 --> 15:54.838
She'll listen to you.
(laughs)

15:54.840 --> 15:57.039
(laughs): I'm not so sure
about that, Danny.

15:57.041 --> 15:58.407
Please.

15:58.409 --> 16:00.076
I need your help.

16:04.982 --> 16:08.851
Marchand made half a dozen
charges in this area

16:08.853 --> 16:11.553
over a four hour period
yesterday afternoon.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.689
Sandwich shop
across the street.

16:13.691 --> 16:15.791
And three coffees
at the coffee cart here.

16:15.793 --> 16:17.758
A couple of beers
at Desi Vega.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.560
Why? Was he...

16:19.562 --> 16:22.162
waiting for someone
or waiting on something?

16:22.164 --> 16:23.764
I don't know.
Let's find out.

16:23.766 --> 16:25.165
You want to go to the
sandwich shop first?

16:25.167 --> 16:26.166
Sure.

16:26.168 --> 16:28.335
(phone ringing)

16:31.173 --> 16:32.540
You don't answer
that girl's calls,

16:32.542 --> 16:33.641
she's not going away.

16:33.643 --> 16:35.041
She's gonna come
looking for you.

16:35.043 --> 16:36.610
And you better hope
she's not a bunny boiler

16:36.612 --> 16:38.444
because then
you're screwed.

16:38.446 --> 16:39.779
She's not a bunny boiler.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.347
Then put her
out of her misery.

16:41.349 --> 16:42.883
How do you know
so much about it?

16:42.885 --> 16:44.150
Because I've been on both sides
of that phone.

16:44.152 --> 16:45.585
I've ducked my share of calls...

16:45.587 --> 16:47.787
And you boiled your share
of bunnies?

16:47.789 --> 16:49.523
No.
(chuckles)

16:49.525 --> 16:51.024
I've showed up at
a doorstep or two.

16:51.026 --> 16:52.791
I'm not proud
of that, though.

16:52.793 --> 16:54.593
Well, why do you care
so much about it, anyway?

16:54.595 --> 16:55.694
I don't, Lasalle.

16:55.696 --> 16:57.095
I'm out of here
the second

16:57.097 --> 16:58.531
the FBI shuts
down the cartel.

16:58.533 --> 17:00.432
I was just making
conversation.

17:00.434 --> 17:02.100
Okay.

17:02.102 --> 17:04.637
Well, this girl shows up
for Jazz Fest two years ago.

17:04.638 --> 17:06.104
Mm-hmm.

17:06.106 --> 17:08.606
You know, we hang out
for a couple of weeks

17:08.608 --> 17:10.942
and then she goes home.

17:10.944 --> 17:13.077
Radio silence until now.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.146
So, then just
call the girl,

17:15.147 --> 17:17.015
solve the mystery.

17:17.017 --> 17:18.516
Is that what
the expert says?

17:18.518 --> 17:20.818
No. It's common sense.

17:22.488 --> 17:24.454
You coming or what?

17:24.457 --> 17:27.357
Well, I was just thinking.

17:27.358 --> 17:29.793
What if it's not where
Marchand spent his money,

17:29.795 --> 17:31.227
but where he was
waiting to go?

17:31.229 --> 17:32.228
Meaning?

17:32.230 --> 17:33.830
Sandwich shop,

17:33.832 --> 17:35.365
Desi Vega's and...

17:35.367 --> 17:36.733
the coffee cart.

17:36.735 --> 17:39.135
All within
shouting distance

17:39.137 --> 17:41.038
of city hall.

17:44.508 --> 17:47.142
Marchand took an interesting
stop yesterday.

17:47.144 --> 17:48.377
City hall.

17:48.379 --> 17:49.612
He waited outside

17:49.614 --> 17:50.980
for four hours
before going in.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.448
Find out what
he was doing there?

17:52.450 --> 17:54.483
Better yet,
we can show you.

17:54.485 --> 17:57.219
(video rewinding)

17:59.323 --> 18:01.222
PRIDE:
Mayor Hamilton?

18:07.464 --> 18:09.497
Are you kidding me?

18:09.499 --> 18:11.933
That's about how we
reacted when we saw it.

18:11.935 --> 18:13.802
What does Petty
Officer Marchand want

18:13.804 --> 18:15.003
with the mayor
of New Orleans?

18:15.005 --> 18:16.537
Yeah, well, whatever it is,

18:16.539 --> 18:19.607
I'm thinking it's connected
to what got him killed.

18:38.859 --> 18:39.660
Can I help you?

18:39.661 --> 18:41.261
Federal agent,
here to see the mayor.

18:41.263 --> 18:43.930
Sorry, the mayor's
in a meeting right now.

18:43.932 --> 18:46.332
Well, that's okay.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.866
I'll just let myself in.

18:47.868 --> 18:49.101
Hey, wait!

18:49.103 --> 18:51.036
Wait!
Need to talk, Mr. Mayor.

18:53.907 --> 18:57.109
Uh... ladies and gentlemen,
Dwayne Pride,

18:57.111 --> 18:59.945
protector of our city
and apparently incapable

18:59.947 --> 19:01.280
of making an appointment.

19:01.282 --> 19:03.281
Now, please.

19:03.283 --> 19:05.216
Everybody, it's okay.

19:05.218 --> 19:06.851
Just give me a few
minutes, if you will.

19:06.853 --> 19:08.353
Thank you.

19:11.291 --> 19:12.757
(door closes)

19:12.759 --> 19:15.960
And, uh... what can I do
for you, Dwayne?

19:15.962 --> 19:17.462
Corey Marchand.

19:18.698 --> 19:20.797
Navy SEAL candidate.

19:20.799 --> 19:23.700
Went UA and came to see you
yesterday afternoon.

19:23.702 --> 19:26.136
Well, you know, a lot of people
come to see me.

19:26.138 --> 19:27.337
I am the mayor.

19:27.339 --> 19:28.438
Yeah, well, this person

19:28.440 --> 19:30.340
you had forcibly removed.

19:30.342 --> 19:32.209
Or does that happen a lot, too?

19:32.211 --> 19:33.877
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

19:33.879 --> 19:35.679
So, uh... what's your point?

19:35.681 --> 19:37.346
He was shot to death.

19:37.348 --> 19:40.216
Dumped by the Gretna
ferry landing.

19:40.218 --> 19:42.518
Need to know what he wanted.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.654
I have no idea.

19:44.656 --> 19:45.921
Honestly.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.790
I-I never got a chance
to find out.

19:47.792 --> 19:49.793
Yeah, because
your security detail took him away.

19:49.794 --> 19:51.360
When a stranger comes
up on the mayor...

19:51.362 --> 19:52.628
He's not a stranger!

19:52.630 --> 19:54.529
We couldn't find his phone...

19:54.531 --> 19:56.431
but we got his record
from the phone company.

19:56.433 --> 19:59.367
He made a half dozen calls
to your office.

19:59.369 --> 20:01.736
Now, how do you know Marchand?

20:06.042 --> 20:09.277
Uh...

20:09.279 --> 20:11.478
Lafitte High School basketball.

20:12.348 --> 20:14.548
What? You're a...

20:14.550 --> 20:15.749
you're a booster?

20:15.751 --> 20:17.884
Some of my donors are.

20:17.886 --> 20:19.986
I go to the games.

20:19.988 --> 20:21.622
You know, fund-raisers.

20:21.624 --> 20:25.025
I... cohost the annual
Courtside Dinner,

20:25.027 --> 20:26.627
which happens to be
tomorrow night.

20:26.629 --> 20:28.428
And Marchand?

20:28.430 --> 20:29.762
Met him at the dinner last year.

20:29.764 --> 20:31.063
Said he was going Navy.

20:31.065 --> 20:32.998
I gave him an attaboy,
gave him my card.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.634
I told him if he ever
needed anything...

20:34.636 --> 20:36.436
You'd throw him out
of city hall.

20:36.438 --> 20:39.239
Uh, he was being very aggressive
with me, Dwayne.

20:39.241 --> 20:40.973
He made six phone calls to you.

20:43.044 --> 20:45.377
Ever think that he might have

20:45.379 --> 20:47.312
something important to say?

20:48.148 --> 20:51.082
I figured I'd see him
at the dinner.

20:52.253 --> 20:54.018
(door opens)

20:54.020 --> 20:56.521
Mayor?

21:02.595 --> 21:05.329

Hey, King. We tried to
track Marchand's movements

21:23.214 --> 21:24.414
after city hall.

21:24.416 --> 21:25.448
Didn't find anything.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.849
Yeah, well, whatever happened,

21:26.851 --> 21:28.885
Hamilton knows more
than he's saying.

21:28.887 --> 21:31.954
Might have to do with
the Lafitte basketball team.

21:31.956 --> 21:35.191
I got Sonja looking into
Hamilton's movements yesterday.

21:35.193 --> 21:36.224
Help her out, would you?

21:36.226 --> 21:38.226
Oh, doing a deep dive
on the mayor?

21:38.228 --> 21:41.096
Why not? It's been a couple
days since we went gone rogue.

21:41.098 --> 21:42.464
(elevator bell dings)

21:42.466 --> 21:44.266
Mayor's a person
of interest now?

21:44.268 --> 21:45.834
Wouldn't be the first time.

21:45.836 --> 21:48.437
Whatever Marchand wanted
to say to the mayor

21:48.439 --> 21:51.940
is why he freaked out during
training exercises and went UA.

21:51.942 --> 21:54.108
Only connection point's
Marchand's basketball team.

21:54.110 --> 21:56.143
Basketball's big
business here.

21:56.145 --> 21:57.295
Where there's smoke, there's...

21:57.319 --> 21:59.281
Is everything
in this town dirty?

21:59.282 --> 22:00.415
And D.C. is so...

22:00.417 --> 22:02.249
(tongue clicks)
squeaky clean?

22:02.251 --> 22:05.052
WOMAN:
Christopher Lasalle.

22:05.054 --> 22:07.455
I have called you
all sorts of names...

22:07.457 --> 22:10.190
“Rude” was never one of them.

22:11.226 --> 22:13.327
You've been ignoring me.

22:13.329 --> 22:14.695
Told you so.

22:14.697 --> 22:16.530
See you inside.

22:16.532 --> 22:18.164
Melody.

22:18.166 --> 22:19.666
(chuckles)
It's great to see you.

22:19.668 --> 22:21.000
All evidence to the contrary.

22:21.002 --> 22:23.804
I know. I've been rude.

22:23.806 --> 22:25.505
I've been busy, but...

22:25.507 --> 22:26.639
that's no excuse.

22:26.641 --> 22:28.874
Yeah. That's more like it.

22:28.876 --> 22:30.609
Oh...

22:30.611 --> 22:32.511
Hold on.

22:32.513 --> 22:34.246
It's been a long time, Mel.

22:34.248 --> 22:35.881
Yeah, well,
not too long to forget

22:35.883 --> 22:37.483
about how much fun we had.

22:37.485 --> 22:39.752
(chuckles)
I know we had a good time.

22:39.754 --> 22:41.854
Yeah.
- But times have changed.

22:41.856 --> 22:42.955
People, too.

22:42.957 --> 22:45.357
Funny, that's, uh...

22:45.359 --> 22:47.625
kind of why I wanted
to get in touch.

22:48.662 --> 22:51.863
Drove all the way
from Charleston to see you.

22:53.233 --> 22:55.433
I got to show you something.
(laughs)

23:02.575 --> 23:04.475
His name's Tucker.

23:04.477 --> 23:07.878
Wow. You're a mom now.

23:08.914 --> 23:12.148

So, from what I've put together,

23:26.964 --> 23:29.665
Mayor Hamilton left city hall
yesterday afternoon,

23:29.667 --> 23:32.435
went to the charity event,
and then straight home.

23:32.437 --> 23:33.836
Nothing suspicious about it.

23:33.838 --> 23:35.704
Okay. We could get a warrant,
dump his phone.

23:35.706 --> 23:38.450
Or Patton could skip
due process, hack his way in.

23:38.450 --> 23:39.875
Mm-mm.
Patton's out of town,

23:39.877 --> 23:41.443
and we don't have enough
evidence for a warrant.

23:41.445 --> 23:42.611
Not yet we don't, but I'm onto

23:42.613 --> 23:44.112
something interesting.

23:44.114 --> 23:45.547
Oh, what you got?
Marchand went UA

23:45.549 --> 23:48.082
two days before
the annual Courtside Dinner,

23:48.084 --> 23:49.373
the one the Lafitte
basketball team has.

23:49.397 --> 23:49.873
Mm-hmm.

23:49.874 --> 23:51.286
I looked into the dinner.

23:51.288 --> 23:53.587
Found this article.

23:53.589 --> 23:55.322
Oh, the dinner
got cancelled last year?

23:55.324 --> 23:57.157
More like shut down.
There was a brawl.

23:57.159 --> 23:59.259
Police got involved, everything.

23:59.261 --> 24:01.261
Okay. But what does that
have to do with Marchand?

24:01.263 --> 24:02.763
Marchand's the one
that started the fight.

24:02.765 --> 24:04.799
He went after his coach,
guy named...

24:04.801 --> 24:06.534
Bud Erens? Broke his jaw.

24:06.536 --> 24:08.068
But there's nothing
in Marchand's record that says

24:08.070 --> 24:09.436
he was arrested
for assault.

24:09.438 --> 24:11.404
Because he wasn't.
I called NOPD.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.339
No sign of a police report.
(cell phone dings)

24:13.341 --> 24:14.474
(exhales)

24:14.476 --> 24:16.275
Sebastian-- he's got something.

24:16.277 --> 24:17.977
I'm gonna meet Pride
at the morgue.

24:17.979 --> 24:20.112
Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

24:20.114 --> 24:22.114
Yo, country mouse. You okay?

24:22.116 --> 24:24.617
Looks like a bomb
got dropped on you.

24:24.619 --> 24:26.318
(exhales)
You got no idea.

24:26.320 --> 24:28.119
All right.
Well, fill me in later.

24:28.121 --> 24:30.088
Hey, Sebastian.
What do you got?

24:30.090 --> 24:31.990
That bad, huh?

24:31.992 --> 24:34.693
Let's... stick to the case.

24:34.695 --> 24:36.462
All right.

24:36.464 --> 24:37.963
Road trip...

24:37.965 --> 24:40.632
to get intimately acquainted
with Coach Bud Erens.

24:40.634 --> 24:43.835
Could be the key to
why Marchand went UA.

24:45.638 --> 24:48.105
The history of sauce has always
been rife with intrigue.

24:48.107 --> 24:50.541
You know? Ever since
the first man mixed ketchup

24:50.543 --> 24:53.377
and mayonnaise, added relish
and called it “secret.”

24:53.379 --> 24:55.487
Some people actually call it
Thousand Island dressing.

24:55.511 --> 24:56.515
PRIDE: Sebastian.

24:56.516 --> 24:58.218
Why are we here?

24:58.242 --> 24:59.117
Oh, right.

24:59.118 --> 25:00.917
Petty Officer Marchand's
stomach contents...

25:00.919 --> 25:02.552
Oh, you found
Thousand Island dressing?

25:02.554 --> 25:04.554
Uh, no. But I did find shrimp

25:04.556 --> 25:06.823
covered in a mixture of garlic,

25:06.825 --> 25:08.992
Worcestershire sauce,
creole seasoning,

25:08.994 --> 25:10.827
various other unique
ingredients.

25:10.829 --> 25:13.463
In other words, secret sauce.

25:13.465 --> 25:15.164
Technically,
it's just special sauce,

25:15.166 --> 25:17.800
since the recipe is readily
available on their Web site.

25:17.802 --> 25:19.201
Who is “they,” Sebastian?

25:19.203 --> 25:20.769
Oh. Fox's restaurant?

25:20.771 --> 25:23.005
It's where Marchand had
his last meal yesterday.

25:23.007 --> 25:25.541
It's not a bad choice, either,
as far as last meals go.

25:25.543 --> 25:26.909
They're known for having
the best barbeque shrimp

25:26.911 --> 25:28.110
this side of the Mississippi.

25:28.112 --> 25:29.945
That's not all
they're known for.

25:29.947 --> 25:31.213
Fox's hosts the Courtside Dinner

25:31.215 --> 25:33.848

25:35.819 --> 25:37.251

25:39.583 --> 25:41.089
I'll stay here, though.
I'll... I'll, uh...

25:41.090 --> 25:42.790
I'll mix some
of this stuff up.

Marchand
was a star player.

25:57.239 --> 25:59.239
Great kid,
had a bright future.

25:59.241 --> 26:01.241
Worked hard to get him
a scholarship at L.S.U.

26:01.243 --> 26:02.809
He chose a different path.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.111
We know he came by
the restaurant yesterday.

26:05.113 --> 26:06.413
Any idea why?

26:06.415 --> 26:07.713
I wasn't around, unfortunately.

26:07.715 --> 26:09.815
I was hoping to see him
at the Courtside Dinner.

26:09.817 --> 26:13.085
I'm surprised he got an invite
after the fight last year.

26:13.087 --> 26:14.887
Oh, Corey and Coach just...

26:14.889 --> 26:17.924
heated up a little.
You know, boys being boys.

26:17.926 --> 26:20.560
Coach's jaw was broken.
Police were called in.

26:20.562 --> 26:22.562
Yeah. I know.
It got pretty ugly.

26:22.564 --> 26:24.396
PRIDE: Marchand left the base
without permission,

26:24.398 --> 26:25.764
went to two places--

26:25.766 --> 26:29.100
city hall
and your restaurant.

26:29.102 --> 26:31.402
And then he was killed.

26:31.404 --> 26:32.871
Corey was a good kid.

26:32.873 --> 26:34.472
His mom did the best by him
that she could,

26:34.474 --> 26:36.708
God rest her soul,
but he grew up hard.

26:36.710 --> 26:39.177
Rough neighborhoods,
drugs, gangs.

26:39.179 --> 26:40.779
MAN: Mr. Fox.
Uh, excuse me.

Not sure Marchand
came here to see him.

26:47.252 --> 26:48.752
My guess...

26:48.754 --> 26:50.721
is the busboy.

26:50.723 --> 26:53.323

since we walked in.

26:53.325 --> 26:55.960

You're about to ask me about

27:05.737 --> 27:09.005
'cause I haven't seen him

What's your name, son?

27:13.344 --> 27:15.644
Mason Holt.

27:15.646 --> 27:17.479
Okay, Mason. Here's the thing.

27:17.481 --> 27:19.081
We know he was here last night.

27:19.083 --> 27:21.149
Just a matter of time
for us to figure out

27:21.151 --> 27:24.385
if you were working then, too,
so just save us the legwork.

27:24.387 --> 27:27.255

Corey came in, okay?

27:27.257 --> 27:29.625
He ate. Shot the breeze.
He left.

27:29.627 --> 27:30.926
So, why'd you lie?

27:30.928 --> 27:32.260
I don't want trouble.

27:32.262 --> 27:33.995
But there is
trouble, Mason.

27:33.997 --> 27:35.462
Your friend is dead.

27:36.532 --> 27:38.365
But you already know
that, don't you?

27:38.367 --> 27:40.367
Like I said,
I don't know nothing.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.302
Okay, but see,
the way you're saying

27:42.304 --> 27:45.673
you don't know nothing,
tells me you know a lot.

27:45.675 --> 27:46.874
(sighs)

27:46.876 --> 27:48.442
Did you play ball together?

27:48.444 --> 27:51.344
He was small forward,
I was point guard.

27:51.346 --> 27:52.979
Must have had skills.

27:52.981 --> 27:54.547
I was all right.

27:54.549 --> 27:56.883
Not like Corey.
So, the fight

27:56.885 --> 27:59.552
between Marchand
and Coach Erens last year?

27:59.554 --> 28:00.987
It wasn't much of a fight.

28:00.989 --> 28:02.488
Corey clocked Coach good.

28:02.490 --> 28:03.589
Want to tell us why?

28:03.591 --> 28:06.425
I can't.

28:06.427 --> 28:09.728
Some things you never say.

28:10.865 --> 28:13.899
No matter what.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.035
Marchand had a secret?

28:16.037 --> 28:17.836
Something to do
with Coach Erens?

28:17.838 --> 28:19.872
Why you keep asking me
about Coach?

28:19.874 --> 28:21.506
Coach is a great guy.

28:21.508 --> 28:24.042
All right. Coach is great.

28:24.711 --> 28:27.979
So, tell me this.

28:27.981 --> 28:30.648
How'd you get the scars
on your wrists?

28:30.650 --> 28:32.784
(exhales)

28:33.687 --> 28:37.055
I got to get back to work.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.356
Hey, Mason.

28:39.358 --> 28:40.457
Sonja. Let him go.

28:40.459 --> 28:42.859
For now.

28:42.861 --> 28:44.961
Well, we got two players
and a coach.

28:44.963 --> 28:46.863
This isn't about drugs or gangs.

28:46.865 --> 28:48.498
This is a basketball team.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.033
Yeah. Something
being covered up

28:50.035 --> 28:51.501
by a lot of people.
- Yeah.

28:51.503 --> 28:54.871
And all roads lead
to Coach Erens.

28:54.873 --> 28:56.807
(phone line ringing)

28:56.809 --> 28:58.774
Christopher.
LASALLE: Yes, sir.

28:58.776 --> 29:00.876
Need you to track down
Coach Erens right away.

29:00.878 --> 29:02.444
Way ahead of you, King.

29:02.446 --> 29:05.147
Somebody else got to him first.

29:19.323 --> 29:21.990
(siren wailing)

29:21.992 --> 29:25.694
Petty Officer Marchand freaks
out during SEAL drownproofing,

29:25.696 --> 29:27.262
goes UA.

29:27.264 --> 29:29.865
Tries to contact Mayor Hamilton
and a former teammate

29:29.867 --> 29:32.100
about some sort of secret
having to do

29:32.102 --> 29:33.969
with the high school
basketball team.

29:33.971 --> 29:36.437
Ends up shot to death.
Maybe because of a fight he had

29:36.439 --> 29:38.038
with his coach a year ago.

29:38.040 --> 29:41.509
Yeah, who was also... shot dead.

29:41.511 --> 29:43.310
(camera shutter clicking)

29:43.312 --> 29:45.780
Well, I found Marchand's
missing cell.

29:45.782 --> 29:47.548
He was here
before he was killed.

29:47.550 --> 29:48.949
PRIDE:
Why would he leave it?

29:48.951 --> 29:50.685
And what's this big secret

29:50.687 --> 29:52.586
that got
two people killed?

29:52.588 --> 29:55.789
I think we all know what secret
they're talking about here.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.057
What?

29:58.059 --> 30:00.427
The profiler in me
sees this big screen TV,

30:00.429 --> 30:03.329
every gaming system
known to man.

30:03.331 --> 30:05.499
It's tailor-made
for teenage boys.

30:05.501 --> 30:06.933
LASALLE: Well, Sebastian
and I have big TVs

30:06.935 --> 30:09.268
and gaming system.
That doesn't mean anything.

30:09.270 --> 30:11.470
Yeah, but what about
his wall of fame over there?

30:11.472 --> 30:13.939
Sure does like
to throw parties for his boys.

30:13.941 --> 30:16.975
He's their... their coach.
I mean, that's not uncommon.

30:16.977 --> 30:19.412
Him and Marchand being murdered
makes it uncommon.

30:19.414 --> 30:21.614
You think Marchand
was abused by his coach?

30:21.616 --> 30:23.482
SONJA:
It's definitely a possibility.

30:23.484 --> 30:24.817
Check this out.

30:24.819 --> 30:26.451
Texts from Marchand
to the coach.

30:26.453 --> 30:27.886
“You need to face the facts.

30:27.888 --> 30:29.754
“Admit what happened
to me and the others.

30:29.756 --> 30:30.882
If you don't, I will.”

30:30.906 --> 30:31.990
GREGORIO:
He was trying to expose

30:31.991 --> 30:34.191
the truth about the abuse.

30:34.193 --> 30:36.494
Coach kills him
to keep it a secret?

30:36.496 --> 30:38.329
Yeah. But who killed the coach?

30:38.331 --> 30:41.800
♪ ♪

30:41.802 --> 30:43.166
What do you see, Gregorio?

30:44.202 --> 30:46.537
This picture of Marchand.

30:46.539 --> 30:48.038
Check out his wrists.

30:52.812 --> 30:54.210
PRIDE:
Wrist bands.

30:54.212 --> 30:55.579
He's the only one wearing them.

30:55.581 --> 30:57.080
Hiding something?

30:57.082 --> 31:00.416
SONJA: I saw marks
on Mason's wrists, too.

31:00.418 --> 31:03.085
Maybe tying up was
the coach's thing.

31:03.087 --> 31:05.187
GREGORIO:
Marchand was bound before.

31:05.189 --> 31:07.056
That's why he freaked out
in training.

31:07.058 --> 31:10.793
Sexual abuse in these situations
is rarely an isolated incident.

31:10.795 --> 31:13.262
Probably other victims
out there.

31:19.402 --> 31:21.135
Upon further examination,

31:21.137 --> 31:26.207
I found evidence of hypertrophic
scars on Marchand's wrists.

31:26.209 --> 31:28.510
Suggests a history
of being bound.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.244
Explains why the
drownproofing exercise

31:30.246 --> 31:32.814
caused Marchand to panic.

31:32.816 --> 31:35.950
His instructor motivated
him to face his issues.

31:35.952 --> 31:38.318
Went looking for his abuser.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.653
Threatened to expose him.

31:39.655 --> 31:41.755
It's possible Marchand
killed his coach,

31:41.757 --> 31:44.859
someone else killed him
to keep the scandal quiet.

31:44.861 --> 31:46.360
Mm. Afraid not, Dwayne.

31:46.362 --> 31:50.230
Lividity suggests Marchand
was dead hours before

31:50.232 --> 31:51.998
Coach Erens was killed.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.600
What are we missing here?

31:53.602 --> 31:55.134
The murder weapon.

31:55.136 --> 31:58.605
But Sebastian's got
slugs from both bodies.

31:58.607 --> 32:02.108
May find your answer.

32:03.411 --> 32:06.112
You're looking for an answer
from me about Danny.

32:06.982 --> 32:08.313
I don't have one.

32:08.315 --> 32:09.548
You couldn't convince him

32:09.550 --> 32:11.082
to change his mind
about enlisting?

32:11.084 --> 32:12.684
Honestly?

32:12.686 --> 32:14.119
I didn't try.

32:15.088 --> 32:18.089
That makes no sense
to me, Dwayne!

32:19.727 --> 32:22.728
He hasn't made
this choice lightly.

32:22.730 --> 32:23.996
He gave it a lot of thought

32:23.998 --> 32:25.663
and it's not my place
to stand in his way.

32:25.665 --> 32:27.532
It absolutely is your place.

32:27.534 --> 32:29.299
You have a stake in his future.

32:29.301 --> 32:30.668
I know.

32:30.670 --> 32:32.670
But it's still <i>his</i> future.

32:32.672 --> 32:34.605
Don't.

32:34.607 --> 32:36.741
That boy's seen
too much violence,

32:36.743 --> 32:39.010
too much hardship.

32:39.012 --> 32:41.245
No reason for him
to face any more.

32:41.247 --> 32:43.547
He doesn't see the Navy
as hardship, Loretta.

32:43.549 --> 32:47.283
He sees it as an
opportunity to serve.

32:47.285 --> 32:49.085
He asked me to tell you.

32:49.087 --> 32:50.921
Why can't he tell me?

32:50.923 --> 32:54.991
Guess he takes after his mother
in that way.

32:58.996 --> 33:03.065
I'm gonna go check in with
Sebastian about the ballistics.

33:05.235 --> 33:08.136
(quietly):
Talk to your boy.

33:12.409 --> 33:14.176
GREGORIO:
The girl must've gotten to you

33:14.178 --> 33:15.910
if you're considering
that invitation.

33:15.912 --> 33:17.712
Not considering anything
right now.

33:17.714 --> 33:20.815
Just waiting on Coach Erens'
personnel file from Lafitte.

33:20.817 --> 33:22.050
Hey, look, I get it.

33:22.052 --> 33:23.317
Smoking hot girl.

33:23.319 --> 33:24.819
It's a biological imperative.

33:24.821 --> 33:26.760
Well, let's just say
it's complicated.

33:26.784 --> 33:27.798
Mm-hmm.

33:27.799 --> 33:30.399
All right, (computer chimes)
here's the personnel file.

33:30.458 --> 33:34.026
Erens took over the program
three years ago.

33:34.028 --> 33:36.028
He's got a stellar
winning percentage.

33:36.030 --> 33:37.429
He'd come highly recommended

33:37.431 --> 33:39.631
from his previous school
in Tennessee.

33:39.633 --> 33:41.200
I looked into the coach's
criminal record.

33:41.202 --> 33:43.135
Not so much
as a speeding ticket.

33:43.137 --> 33:44.636
There's no smoke here.

33:44.638 --> 33:46.504
Well, I found our smoke.

33:46.506 --> 33:49.441
Just spoke to a friend
at NOPD Special Victims.

33:49.443 --> 33:52.176
Complaint filed by a parent
a few years back.

33:52.178 --> 33:53.310
You got details?

33:53.312 --> 33:55.246
Allegations of sexual abuse.

33:55.248 --> 33:57.949
The victim was a freshman,
remained anonymous.

33:57.951 --> 33:59.884
The parents claimed
he wasn't the only one,

33:59.886 --> 34:01.652
and it landed on the DA's desk.

34:01.654 --> 34:03.221
I already checked with the DA.
There were no investigations.

34:03.223 --> 34:04.722
Right.

34:04.724 --> 34:07.224
That's because the DA
squashed the whole thing.

34:07.226 --> 34:09.126
Told the cops to back off,

34:09.128 --> 34:12.161
and the family ended up
transferring out of state.

34:12.164 --> 34:13.429
So, when'd this happen?

34:13.431 --> 34:14.664
Five years ago.

34:14.666 --> 34:15.799
So, before Coach Erens

34:15.801 --> 34:17.333
took over the program.

34:17.335 --> 34:18.735
He's not the abuser.

34:18.737 --> 34:19.936
Who's got the juice

34:19.938 --> 34:21.170
for this kind of cover up,
though?

34:21.172 --> 34:22.605
PRIDE:
I can think of someone.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.641
Hamilton was a councilman
back then.

34:26.643 --> 34:29.110
Deep ties to the DA's office.

34:29.112 --> 34:31.781
Makes the scandal go away
to protect the team.

34:31.783 --> 34:33.382
That doesn't make him
our shooter.

34:33.384 --> 34:35.050
No.

34:35.052 --> 34:36.518
But we do have a lead.

34:36.520 --> 34:37.853
Sebastian got a ballistics match

34:37.855 --> 34:38.920
on the murder weapon.

34:38.922 --> 34:42.056
.380 automatic pistol.

37:40.847 --> 37:42.814
You told somebody else,
the same person

37:42.816 --> 37:46.718
who killed Marchand and Coach,
right?

37:46.720 --> 37:49.053
I didn't, I didn't think
he'd hurt them.

37:50.424 --> 37:52.557
It's not on you, Mason.

37:52.559 --> 37:54.224
It's on him.

37:56.261 --> 37:57.494
Come on.

37:57.496 --> 37:59.963
You can still help finish

37:59.965 --> 38:01.198
what Corey started.

38:01.200 --> 38:02.933
You can honor him.

38:02.935 --> 38:05.636
Yeah.
(knife clatters)

38:07.139 --> 38:09.340
Who hurt Marchand?

38:11.042 --> 38:13.242
Hurt you?

38:13.244 --> 38:15.611
(crying)

38:18.650 --> 38:21.484
Charles Fox.

38:21.486 --> 38:23.185
He did it all.

38:28.091 --> 38:30.625
(crying)

38:40.804 --> 38:42.671
(car door closes,
engine starting)

38:42.673 --> 38:43.972
(knocking)

38:43.974 --> 38:45.105
Where are you goin'?

38:45.107 --> 38:47.274
The party's not over yet.

38:48.778 --> 38:49.877
Don't.

38:49.879 --> 38:50.978
Fox, put
your hands up.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.480
Put 'em up!

38:53.349 --> 38:55.883
Step out.

38:57.653 --> 38:59.019
(grunts)

38:59.955 --> 39:02.422
This is a big misunderstanding.

39:02.424 --> 39:05.091
(handcuffs clicking)
And this is the murder weapon.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.460
It's no <i>bueno,</i> Mr. Fox.

39:18.706 --> 39:21.407
I mean, I knew
Charlie Fox 15 years.

39:21.409 --> 39:25.444
I cannot believe he's
capable of any of that.

39:25.446 --> 39:28.547
That's what people said
about Sandusky.

39:28.549 --> 39:30.716
That's the story
you're going with?

39:32.286 --> 39:36.454
So you think I knew
that he was sexually abusing

39:36.456 --> 39:38.255
the players on the team?
Is that what you're telling me?

39:38.257 --> 39:40.858
I think you didn't want to, and
made sure you didn't have to.

39:40.860 --> 39:42.226
Yeah? And how did I
do that exactly?

39:42.228 --> 39:43.928
You made, you made
allegations disappear.

39:43.930 --> 39:46.831
You had Marchand
removed from city hall.

39:46.833 --> 39:48.533
- I was going to call him.
- Oh, my...

39:48.535 --> 39:50.167
I was going to call him.
Are you kidding me?

39:50.169 --> 39:52.069
Th-there were rumors,
there were rumors, okay?

39:52.071 --> 39:54.404
I heard them;
there were stories.

39:54.406 --> 39:56.673
You know how many rumors
there are in this city?

39:56.675 --> 39:58.542
About everybody.

39:58.544 --> 40:00.510
About me, you even.

40:00.512 --> 40:02.378
You cannot believe it all.

40:02.380 --> 40:03.780
This could've gone different.

40:04.983 --> 40:09.618
Could've gone different if
you'd just talked to Marchand.

40:12.557 --> 40:16.792
Well, I'm just gonna have to
live with that, aren't I?

40:16.794 --> 40:19.294
How's this? I'll establish
a blue ribbon committee.

40:19.296 --> 40:21.129
You can sit on it, yeah.

40:21.131 --> 40:24.600
We'll create a safe haven for
victims of abuse, how's that?

40:24.602 --> 40:27.802
That sounds swell.

40:27.804 --> 40:30.605
Leave me out of it.

40:43.019 --> 40:45.886
Uh, heads up.
Bunny boiler's back.

40:45.888 --> 40:47.588
She's not a
bunny boiler.

40:47.590 --> 40:49.857
Listen, you're a grown man,
go with God, okay?

40:49.859 --> 40:51.124
MELODY:
Is this, uh...

40:51.126 --> 40:52.559
one of your coworkers?

40:52.561 --> 40:55.863
(clears throat)
Yes, it is.

40:55.865 --> 40:58.398
Melody, meet Tammy,
one of my colleagues.

40:58.400 --> 41:00.100
- Tammy, Melody.
- How are you?

41:00.102 --> 41:01.534
I'm good. Thank you.

41:01.536 --> 41:02.602
Who's this little one?

41:02.604 --> 41:04.236
(baby squeaks)

41:05.106 --> 41:07.239
- So cute.
- (laughs) Oh.

41:07.241 --> 41:09.775
This is, uh, Tucker.

41:09.777 --> 41:11.243
Christopher's son.

41:11.245 --> 41:13.513
Hi.

41:14.248 --> 41:16.048
- Hi.
- (Tucker laughing)

41:16.050 --> 41:19.017
Yeah.
(laughing)

41:23.056 --> 41:25.891
DANNY:
All right, so, we go in.

41:25.893 --> 41:27.826
You got my back,
right?

41:27.828 --> 41:29.394
No.

41:29.396 --> 41:32.764
And I don't
have hers either.

41:32.766 --> 41:34.598
Wh... I need help getting
her to understand.

41:34.600 --> 41:35.933
No, you don't.

41:35.935 --> 41:38.536
Just got to tell her
how you feel.

41:40.439 --> 41:44.942
Case today... two young men

41:44.944 --> 41:48.812
struggled to
speak their truth.

41:49.682 --> 41:51.581
Speak yours.

41:51.583 --> 41:53.182
What if she
doesn't accept it?

41:53.184 --> 41:56.786
You hear her out,
you talk about it.

41:56.788 --> 41:59.288
(sighs)

41:59.290 --> 42:01.490
I just want
to make her proud.

42:03.028 --> 42:05.628
You already got that.

42:07.966 --> 42:09.431
She's a wise woman.

42:09.433 --> 42:11.299
She loves you.

42:12.570 --> 42:14.803
Hell of a combo.

42:15.906 --> 42:17.137
Thank you.

42:17.161 --> 42:18.916
You bet.

42:20.243 --> 42:22.410
(sighs)

42:23.847 --> 42:25.646
(car door closes)

42:33.355 --> 42:35.590
Come here.
