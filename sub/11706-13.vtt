00:45.086 --> 00:47.422
{\an8}HOW MANY TIMES

01:57.909 --> 01:59.285
{\an8}IT'S DISGUSTING!

{\an8}- SAM'S BODY LANGUAGE WHEN
SHE'S ON THE PHONE WITH ARVIN

02:01.454 --> 02:02.956
{\an8}IS LIKE,
YOU GOT [bleep] BUSTED.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.040

{\an8}- WHAT IS THE KID SAYING
ON THE PHONE?

02:33.987 --> 02:34.737
{\an8}- THAT HE'S NOTHING
BUT A FRIEND!

02:34.821 --> 02:35.738
{\an8}- YOU'RE [bleep] PATHETIC.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.741
{\an8}YOU'RE PATHETIC.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.742
{\an8}- WHATEVER. I'M NOT
DEALING WITH YOU.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.327
{\an8}- YOU DON'T [bleep] DEAL

{\an8}- THIS IS GONNA BE
AN INTERESTING DINNER.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.964
{\an8}- I'M NOT HAVING HER [bleep]
PLAY YOU OUT THERE,

02:53.047 --> 02:55.508
{\an8}ESPECIALLY WITH
SOMEBODY I KNOW.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.427
{\an8}I-I-I DON'T LIKE THAT.
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.387
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,
THE JOKE'S ON ME.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.431
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE A FOOL.

{\an8}- THIS IS OUR LAST SUNDAY DINNER
AND IT'S GONNA BE CRICKETS.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.436
{\an8}- I THINK AT THIS POINT,

03:06.519 --> 03:09.022
{\an8}WE SHOULD JUST
LET THEM DEAL WITH IT.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.732
{\an8}- YEAH.
- GOOD JOB.

03:10.815 --> 03:12.775
{\an8}- US GETTING INVOLVED
IS JUST MAKING IT WORSE.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.569
{\an8}- LOOK AT PAULY COOKIN'!

03:14.652 --> 03:16.279
{\an8}I'M IMPRESSED
WITH THE WHOLE TEAM.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.323
{\an8}THE LAST SUNDAY DINNER,

03:18.406 --> 03:20.241
{\an8}EVERYBODY'S CHIPPING IN HARD.

03:20.325 --> 03:23.745

{\an8}- I'M, LIKE, EXCITED ABOUT
GOING OUT TOMORROW NIGHT.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.175
{\an8}- OH, HELL YEAH.

03:37.258 --> 03:38.509
{\an8}- DANNY'S THROWING A BARBECUE
FOR EVERYBODY

03:38.593 --> 03:40.136
{\an8}AT THE SHORE STORE,
AND I MIGHT INVITE

03:40.219 --> 03:41.554
{\an8}TWO OF MY BEST FRIENDS
FROM BACK HOME.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.056
{\an8}- WAIT, SO CAN WE
BRING TWO OR THREE?

03:43.139 --> 03:45.475
{\an8}TWO?
- THREE. THAT'S MY WORD.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.809
{\an8}YOU CAN BRING THREE PEOPLE.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.144
{\an8}NO FAMILY MEMBERS.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.312
{\an8}- I CAN'T BRING MY DAD?

03:49.395 --> 03:52.607
{\an8}- YOU CAN'T.
- REALLY, NO FAMILY MEMBERS?

03:52.690 --> 03:53.900
{\an8}- 'CAUSE IT'S GONNA BE WILD.

03:58.529 --> 04:02.367
{\an8}- I'M JUST GONNA TELL MARK
AND SOPHIA NOT TO COME.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.076
{\an8}- OKAY, IF THAT'S
WHO YOU WANT.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.703
{\an8}I'M GOING BY MYSELF.

{\an8}THOSE ARE YOUR FRIENDS,
THOUGH, YOU KNOW?

04:07.580 --> 04:10.667
{\an8}- I CAN'T LOOK ANYBODY
IN THE FACE RIGHT NOW.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.835
{\an8}I JUST WANT TO BURY MY HEAD.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.337
{\an8}I'M EMBARRASSED.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.505
{\an8}I'VE BEEN DEDICATED TO HER,

04:16.589 --> 04:18.757
{\an8}AND SHE'S [bleep] ME OVER
SO MANY TIMES

04:18.841 --> 04:20.301
{\an8}IN THIS HOUSE,
AND I'M OVER IT.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.220
{\an8}I JUST WANT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.430
{\an8}TELL ME THE TRUTH.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.103
{\an8}- I HOOKED UP WITH HIM
WHEN I WAS 21 YEARS OLD.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.854
{\an8}I'M 23, GONNA BE 24.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.148
{\an8}IT WAS YEARS AGO.

04:34.232 --> 04:37.193
{\an8}- SO, THAT'S ALL YOU HAD TO SAY
INSTEAD OF LYING TO ME.

04:37.276 --> 04:40.530
{\an8}- I'M SORRY I LIED TO YOU.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.241
{\an8}I MADE A MISTAKE.
I EMBARRASSED YOU.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.201
{\an8}I EMBARRASSED MYSELF.

04:45.284 --> 04:48.538
{\an8}- NOW YOU [bleep] UP, SO YOU
CAN EITHER FIX YOUR [bleep] UP

04:48.621 --> 04:49.789
{\an8}OR YOU CAN WALK AWAY.

04:49.872 --> 04:51.666
{\an8}THOSE ARE YOUR TWO OPTIONS.

04:51.749 --> 04:54.419
{\an8}YOU HAVE A CHANCE RIGHT NOW
TO RIGHT YOUR WRONGS

04:54.502 --> 04:55.878
{\an8}OR YOU CAN JUST WALK AWAY.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.048
{\an8}TWO OPTIONS.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.842
{\an8}FOR ME TO BE OKAY RIGHT NOW,

05:00.925 --> 05:03.052
{\an8}I NEED SAM TO SHOW ME THAT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.138
{\an8}IF YOU'RE NOT THAT PERSON,
PROVE IT.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.223
{\an8}DON'T [bleep] SAY IT.
SHOW ME.

05:07.306 --> 05:08.516
{\an8}GOOD NIGHT.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.189
{\an8}- YO, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A BIG 40.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.150
{\an8}- WHY DID THEY DO THIS?

05:17.233 --> 05:19.902
{\an8}- DEENA SAYS SHE'S A WINGMAN.
SHE'S ONE OF THE GUYS.

05:19.986 --> 05:24.073
{\an8}IT'S MVPD, BUT TONIGHT, ALL
SHE'S BEING IS A [bleep]BLOCK.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.242
{\an8}- CUCA!
- DID YOU SEE CUCA?

05:26.325 --> 05:28.536
{\an8}- YEP.
- BUT YOU CAN'T SEE IT THAT BAD.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.877
{\an8}- OH!

05:35.960 --> 05:37.420
{\an8}- [bleep] MY LIFE.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.715
{\an8}- I AIN'T DOING [bleep]
TODAY AT WORK.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.425
{\an8}- I WANT TO SEE
DANNY'S REACTION

05:42.508 --> 05:43.509
{\an8}WHEN I WALK INTO THE STORE
WITH YOUR SHIRT ON.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.636
{\an8}THE SHIRT I'M WEARING
TO WORK TODAY,

05:45.720 --> 05:47.722
{\an8}JUST TO BUST DANNY'S CHOPS,
IS THE RUSH SHIRT,

05:47.805 --> 05:49.891
{\an8}BECAUSE HE CAN'T STAND
THE RUSH T-SHIRT SHOP

05:49.974 --> 05:51.517
{\an8}DOWN AT THE OTHER END
OF THE BOARDWALK.

05:51.601 --> 05:52.643
{\an8}BUT I'M LIKE,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:52.727 --> 05:54.979
{\an8}LAST DAY, I'M GOING OUT
WITH A BANG.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.398
{\an8}HEY, WHAT'S UP, MY MAN?
- YO, LOOK AT THIS GUY.

05:57.482 --> 05:57.940
{\an8}LOOK AT THIS GUY.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.778
{\an8}WOW!
- DUDE.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.280
{\an8}OH, THAT ACTUALLY
IS A NICE SHIRT.

06:04.363 --> 06:05.907
{\an8}IT REALLY IS.
- WOW!

06:05.990 --> 06:07.408
{\an8}RIP IT OFF, RIP IT!
- COME ON, COME ON.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.036
{\an8}- [laughs]
- GET THAT OFF, DUDE.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.454
{\an8}- OH, YOU RIPPED IT.

06:11.537 --> 06:15.458
{\an8}- LET ME PUT THAT ONE AWAY
EXACTLY WHERE IT BELONGS.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.418
{\an8}- THIS IS OUR LAST DAY
AT THE SHORE STORE,

06:17.502 --> 06:20.171
{\an8}SO I HAVE FULL INTENTION OF
NOT WORKING TODAY AT ALL.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.799
{\an8}I'M GONNA TAKE A NAP
THE WHOLE TIME I'M HERE.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.927
{\an8}- CAN I MAKE A TRACK SUIT?
- YES.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.428
{\an8}- RON, YOU WANT TO GET
SOME PARTING GIFTS

06:27.512 --> 06:29.305
{\an8}FOR YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS?

06:29.388 --> 06:30.348
{\an8}- NO, I'M GOOD.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.141
{\an8}[laughs]
I'LL GO TO RUSH.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.019
{\an8}- WOW.
- OH.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.480
{\an8}- HI.
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

06:37.563 --> 06:41.567
{\an8}- DO YOU NEED HELP
WITH ANYTHING?

06:41.651 --> 06:43.111
{\an8}HOW OLD ARE YOU?
- 21.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.612
{\an8}- AWESOME.

06:44.695 --> 06:47.115
{\an8}- BRO, BRO, BRO, BRO, BRO, BRO,
WAKE UP A LITTLE BIT.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.117
{\an8}WAKE UP.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.118
{\an8}- OH!
- OH, MY GOD.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.411
{\an8}- OH.
- [laughs]

06:52.495 --> 06:55.164
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
2010'S A WRAP.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.000
{\an8}- NICE.
- VINNY, YOU'RE THE MAN.
