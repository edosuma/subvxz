WEBVTT

00:03.708 --> 00:05.375
(male announcer)
We interrupt our
regular evening schedule

00:05.458 --> 00:07.208
to bring you the following
special program.

00:07.292 --> 00:09.083
[instrumental music]

00:10.708 --> 00:13.250
September 16, 2259.

00:14.417 --> 00:15.833
The Interstellar
Network News

00:15.917 --> 00:18.917
presents
"36 Hours On Babylon 5"

00:19.000 --> 00:21.208
with your host
Cynthia Torqueman

00:21.292 --> 00:25.083
reporting live from
the ISN news center in Geneva.

00:25.167 --> 00:27.708
(Cynthia Torqueman)
Good evening.
I'm Cynthia Torqueman.

00:27.792 --> 00:29.208
In the hundred or so years

00:29.292 --> 00:31.208
since humanity
went to the stars

00:31.292 --> 00:33.417
we've established outposts
and colonies

00:33.500 --> 00:35.125
on over two dozen worlds

00:35.208 --> 00:37.500
in 14 solar systems.

00:37.583 --> 00:40.250
Out of all those
far-flung outposts

00:40.333 --> 00:41.583
only the Mars colony

00:41.667 --> 00:44.167
plagued by scattered groups
of separatists

00:44.250 --> 00:46.292
who have used acts
of terror to intimidate

00:46.375 --> 00:47.625
the Earth-loyal majority

00:47.708 --> 00:49.500
has proven
more controversial

00:49.583 --> 00:53.083
than the Earth Alliance
station, Babylon 5.

00:53.167 --> 00:54.792
Located in a sector
of space

00:54.875 --> 00:56.708
near Epsilon Irridonni

00:56.792 --> 00:58.667
designated
neutral territory

00:58.750 --> 01:00.958
Babylon 5
has defied the odds

01:01.042 --> 01:03.792
and continued to operate
as a free port.

01:03.875 --> 01:06.292
A center for diplomacy,
and a showpiece

01:06.375 --> 01:09.875
for the Earth Alliance Resources
and Technologies Division.

01:09.958 --> 01:12.875
From its highly publicized
debut three years ago

01:12.958 --> 01:15.958
recent polls indicate
a growing dissatisfaction

01:16.042 --> 01:19.042
with the time, money,
and effort consumed

01:19.125 --> 01:21.250
by this space-born
community.

01:21.333 --> 01:22.792
So tonight we take you

01:22.875 --> 01:25.292
to the center
of the controversy.

01:25.375 --> 01:30.333
An ISN crew and I recently spent
36 hours aboard Babylon 5

01:30.417 --> 01:31.792
asking hard questions

01:31.875 --> 01:35.667
and on occasion getting in
a little over our heads.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.500
In the process of putting
this report together

01:37.583 --> 01:39.167
it didn't take us long
to learn

01:39.250 --> 01:42.458
the most important rule
of survival aboard Babylon 5..

01:42.542 --> 01:45.250
Expect the unexpected.

01:46.250 --> 01:47.667
'This footage was shot'

01:47.750 --> 01:49.000
'from our position
on the bridge'

01:49.083 --> 01:50.708
'of the Earth Transport Hyerdol'

01:50.792 --> 01:52.458
'on final approach
to Babylon 5.'

01:52.542 --> 01:54.167
(Captain Sheridan)
'Roger, Babylon Control.'

01:54.250 --> 01:56.208
'The voices you are hearing
are the ship's captain'

01:56.292 --> 01:57.667
'and B-5 Command and Control.'

01:57.750 --> 01:59.167
(Captain Sheridan)
'Mark.'

01:59.250 --> 02:00.417
(Commander Ivanova)
'Confirmed, Hyerdol. We..'

02:00.500 --> 02:01.833
'Narn transport, Natung'

02:01.917 --> 02:03.167
'return to your
holding position at once.'

02:03.250 --> 02:04.167
'I repeat, return to--'

02:04.250 --> 02:06.042
[speaking Narn language]

02:06.125 --> 02:07.792
(Commander Ivanova)
'Centauri vessel, Malios,
break off.'

02:07.875 --> 02:10.167
[speaking Narn language]

02:11.208 --> 02:12.500
[explosion]

02:14.792 --> 02:16.375
A terrible explosion.

02:16.458 --> 02:18.958
Conspiracy involving several
of these individuals.

02:19.042 --> 02:23.042
Lies, deception and the deaths
of hundreds of people.

02:23.125 --> 02:26.875
All this and more
in "36 Hours Aboard Babylon 5"

02:26.958 --> 02:29.333
here on the Interstellar
Network News.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.875
We'll be back with our story

02:30.958 --> 02:32.375
right after this break.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.125
(male announcer)
"36 Hours" sponsored by

02:34.208 --> 02:35.958
Interplanetary Expeditions.

02:36.042 --> 02:38.792
Exploring the past
to create a better future.

02:41.458 --> 02:46.833
(male narrator)
The Babylon Project was
our last best hope for peace.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.667
A self-contained world,
five miles long

02:49.750 --> 02:53.000
located in neutral territory.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.583
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

02:57.667 --> 03:01.250
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

03:01.333 --> 03:04.458
A shining beacon in space..

03:04.542 --> 03:06.583
...all alone in the night.

03:06.667 --> 03:10.042
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind.

03:10.125 --> 03:14.375
The year the Great War
came upon us all.

03:14.458 --> 03:18.417
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.708
The year is 2259.

03:20.792 --> 03:23.625
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:23.708 --> 03:25.750
[theme music]

03:53.417 --> 03:55.500
[music continues]

04:10.708 --> 04:12.333
(Cynthia)
'Thirty minutes ago
an armed vessel opened fire'

04:12.417 --> 04:15.542
on a Centauri transport without
warning or explanation.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.042
The bodies of the dead
and wounded

04:17.125 --> 04:18.958
are being brought to
this central docking area

04:19.042 --> 04:21.667
for transfer to various Medlab
facilities on Babylon 5

04:21.750 --> 04:24.875
which are already working
beyond maximum capacity.

04:24.958 --> 04:26.167
Behind me is
Dr. Stephen Franklin.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.417
Chief of staff, doctor.
Dr. Franklin.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.000
...for immediate
surgery and full CAT scan.

04:30.083 --> 04:31.125
And I need more regen
over here, people!

04:31.208 --> 04:32.167
(Cynthia)
'Dr. Franklin'

04:32.250 --> 04:33.292
'Cynthia Torqueman, ISN news.'

04:33.375 --> 04:34.500
'What happened here?'

04:34.583 --> 04:36.083
Somebody said something
about an ambush.

04:36.167 --> 04:38.167
Alright, keep his head elevated
30 degrees minimum

04:38.250 --> 04:39.500
or he'll choke on his own blood.

04:39.583 --> 04:42.250
- Can you say what--
- Look, I'm sorry.

04:42.333 --> 04:45.000
(Cynthia)
Captain Sheridan,
Cynthia Torqueman, ISN news.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.792
'Do you have any comment
on what just happened here?'

04:46.875 --> 04:49.000
No, no comment at this time.
Doctor.

04:49.083 --> 04:51.667
(Cynthia)
'What about the Narn vessel
that attacked the transport?'

04:51.750 --> 04:53.375
We dispatched a fighter wing
to apprehend them.

04:53.458 --> 04:54.667
We won't know anything more

04:54.750 --> 04:56.083
until they're in
protective custody.

04:56.167 --> 04:58.417
If you will excuse me, please.
Doctor.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.042
(Ambassador Mollari)
'This is exactly
the kind of behavior'

05:01.125 --> 05:05.208
that endangers the very purpose
of Babylon 5.

05:05.292 --> 05:06.917
This place is dedicated

05:07.000 --> 05:10.083
to finding peaceful solutions
to our problems.

05:10.167 --> 05:12.542
For the Narn to carry
their vendetta

05:12.625 --> 05:16.375
against our people into
neutral territory like this

05:16.458 --> 05:18.833
is reckless
and irresponsible.

05:20.667 --> 05:23.375
And though we mourn
our own losses

05:23.458 --> 05:27.375
we have felt strongly
about our friends from Earth

05:27.458 --> 05:29.583
ever since we first
encountered your world

05:29.667 --> 05:31.375
a hundred years ago.

05:32.792 --> 05:37.292
To endanger your people,
for no reason.

05:37.375 --> 05:38.917
(Cynthia)
'Then the attack
on your transport'

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
'was completely unprovoked.'

05:41.083 --> 05:42.750
Of course.

05:42.833 --> 05:44.250
(Ambassador G'Kar)
'He's lying.'

05:44.333 --> 05:46.208
Then tell us why your
ship opened fire

05:46.292 --> 05:47.500
on the Centauri transport?

05:47.583 --> 05:48.667
I'll issue a statement

05:48.750 --> 05:50.292
after I've consulted
with my government.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.167
Are you saying your government
sanctioned this attack?

05:52.250 --> 05:53.167
No.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.625
Do you think attacks
of this nature

05:54.708 --> 05:57.917
put everybody aboard Babylon 5
in unnecessary jeopardy?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.917
We are already in
far greater jeopardy

06:00.000 --> 06:02.125
than you can possibly imagine.

06:04.208 --> 06:07.667
For all the apparent danger
in this part of space

06:07.750 --> 06:10.333
it seems to have had
little effect on travel.

06:10.417 --> 06:13.417
Nearly quarter of a million
humans and aliens are here

06:13.500 --> 06:14.875
at any given moment.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.750
While most are in transit
to distant worlds

06:17.833 --> 06:21.083
many others actually live
and work here.

06:21.167 --> 06:22.292
What does it take

06:22.375 --> 06:25.792
to call a place
like this...home?

06:25.875 --> 06:28.000
Well, it's a, it's a job.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.750
I've been in a lot worse places,
let me tell you.

06:30.833 --> 06:32.375
It gets crazy
around here sometimes.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.667
You get 50, 60 ships a day
coming through here

06:34.750 --> 06:36.125
loading and unloading

06:36.208 --> 06:38.125
and every last one of them
is a priority job.

06:38.208 --> 06:39.542
At least that's what
they tell us.

06:39.625 --> 06:40.917
Hey, watch those crates
over there.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.208
Get 'em over to the side.

06:42.292 --> 06:44.167
- No, no, the other side.
- 'Alright.'

06:44.250 --> 06:46.417
We had a couple of problems
here last year.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.250
Tried to hit us
with some budget cuts.

06:48.333 --> 06:52.000
You know, same old song,
but, uh, that's the past.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.208
You got to go along
to get along.

06:53.292 --> 06:54.500
You know what I mean?

06:54.583 --> 06:55.833
Overall I've found this

06:55.917 --> 06:57.542
to be a good working environment

06:57.625 --> 06:59.042
and a valuable experience.

06:59.125 --> 07:00.250
I've learned a lot
while I've been here.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.625
(Cynthia)
'And you've never felt'

07:01.708 --> 07:03.333
'that your safety
has been compromised?'

07:03.417 --> 07:04.542
No, ma'am.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.708
(Cynthia)
'So this has been a positive'

07:05.792 --> 07:07.625
'experience for you.'

07:07.708 --> 07:09.333
'You enjoy working
with everyone?'

07:10.750 --> 07:11.833
Yes.

07:11.917 --> 07:15.125
It's a calm,
pleasant environment.

07:15.208 --> 07:17.125
I don't think I've ever seen
anyone get upset here.

07:19.458 --> 07:21.500
I guess it's the old joke.

07:21.583 --> 07:24.958
You don't have to be crazy to
work here, but it helps.

07:26.875 --> 07:29.833
I suppose there is
a certain attraction

07:29.917 --> 07:32.167
to being out here
on the edge like this

07:32.250 --> 07:33.417
a new frontier.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
New frontier is right.

07:35.583 --> 07:38.833
When Babylon 5
went online in 2257

07:38.917 --> 07:40.417
odds makers from New Vegas

07:40.500 --> 07:41.708
to Lloyd's of London
were predicting

07:41.792 --> 07:44.042
it wouldn't last six months.

07:45.542 --> 07:48.000
Well, I've never been
very much on gambling.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.333
I've never quite
found the time for it.

07:50.417 --> 07:53.167
(Cynthia)
'You were originally
a starship captain, correct?'

07:53.250 --> 07:54.375
Yeah.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.208
The Agamemnon.

07:56.292 --> 07:57.833
She was a real beauty.

07:57.917 --> 07:59.458
One of the first
Omega class destroyers

07:59.542 --> 08:01.750
to come off the construction
line after the war.

08:02.875 --> 08:06.042
Our job was
part military patrol

08:06.125 --> 08:08.167
part diplomatic mission.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.167
We went around to
most of the non-aligned worlds

08:10.250 --> 08:13.792
put in an appearance, kept
the peace that sort of thing.

08:13.875 --> 08:16.542
(Cynthia)
'Babylon 5 has been through
some dramatic changes'

08:16.625 --> 08:18.833
'in administration since it
became operational.'

08:20.625 --> 08:25.208
Would you attribute these
changes to...bad management?

08:25.292 --> 08:28.042
'Or to quote
former Senator Hidoshi'

08:28.125 --> 08:31.708
'"Is this horse just too big
for anybody to ride?"'

08:31.792 --> 08:34.417
Changes are part
of the military life.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.083
Everybody goes into this

08:37.167 --> 08:39.750
knowing that tomorrow
you could be someplace

08:39.833 --> 08:43.417
that you hadn't even
heard of 24 hours ago.

08:43.500 --> 08:46.208
I've been stationed so many
places over the years

08:46.292 --> 08:48.500
I-I can't even remember
most of them.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.583
But you're right.

08:51.667 --> 08:55.292
Some days this is
one hell of a big horse.

08:57.042 --> 08:59.333
You know what the folks
back home don't understand.

08:59.417 --> 09:00.792
The ones who've
never left Earth

09:00.875 --> 09:04.292
is just how dangerous
space can be.

09:04.375 --> 09:08.708
Aside from incidents like this,
just the everyday reality

09:08.792 --> 09:10.792
of living your days and nights

09:10.875 --> 09:13.500
in a big tin can
surrounded by vacuum.

09:15.708 --> 09:18.458
I remember my first time
on a transport

09:18.542 --> 09:21.125
on the Moon-Mars run.

09:21.208 --> 09:23.083
I was just a kid, maybe 17.

09:24.292 --> 09:26.917
A buddy of mine
was messing around

09:27.000 --> 09:29.875
zipping through the halls

09:29.958 --> 09:33.167
and he hid in
one of the airlocks.

09:33.250 --> 09:34.958
I don't know, I guess he was
going to try to scare us

09:35.042 --> 09:37.125
or something, I don't know.

09:37.208 --> 09:39.375
But just as I got close..

09:41.375 --> 09:42.833
...he must have hit
the wrong button

09:42.917 --> 09:45.833
because the air doors
slammed shut

09:45.917 --> 09:47.000
space doors opened

09:47.083 --> 09:50.250
and he...just flew out
into space.

09:53.042 --> 09:54.667
And the one thing
they never tell you

09:54.750 --> 09:58.000
is that you don't die
instantly in a vacuum.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.208
He just hung there
against the black

10:03.292 --> 10:07.458
like a puppet with his strings
all tangled up.

10:07.542 --> 10:09.000
Or one of those old cartoons

10:09.083 --> 10:10.250
where you run off
the edge of the cliff

10:10.333 --> 10:12.167
and your legs keep going.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.708
You could see that
he was trying to breathe

10:16.792 --> 10:18.625
but there was nothing.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.667
The one thing I remember
when they pulled in his body..

10:25.917 --> 10:28.167
...his eyes were frozen.

10:32.167 --> 10:35.792
A lot of people make jokes
about spacing somebody

10:35.875 --> 10:38.792
about shoving somebody
out an airlock.

10:40.583 --> 10:42.792
I don't think it's funny.

10:44.292 --> 10:45.625
Never will.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.708
Although the airlocks
on Babylon 5

10:48.792 --> 10:49.917
are considerably safer

10:50.000 --> 10:51.375
the last three years
have shown

10:51.458 --> 10:53.875
that the station itself
is anything but secure.

10:53.958 --> 10:55.375
In its first year of operation

10:55.458 --> 10:57.917
there were half a dozen murders,
three acts of sabotage

10:58.000 --> 11:00.208
including a bomb
that blew out two levels

11:00.292 --> 11:03.333
and a barely averted attack
by the Vorlon empire.

11:03.417 --> 11:06.042
Since then, there have been
50 deaths by violence.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.875
So the question remains.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Given its cost
in lives and money

11:10.083 --> 11:12.625
is Babylon 5 serving
any useful purpose

11:12.708 --> 11:14.500
or as we're about to see

11:14.583 --> 11:17.917
is the whole thing
falling apart at the seams?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.583
I've just been briefed
by my government

11:19.667 --> 11:22.708
and I'm prepared to issue
the following statement.

11:22.792 --> 11:24.292
The Centauri ship
that was attacked

11:24.375 --> 11:25.708
by one of our vessels

11:25.792 --> 11:28.833
was not simply
a commercial transport.

11:28.917 --> 11:32.417
It was secretly transferring
weapons of mass destruction

11:32.500 --> 11:34.167
to ships bound
for the front lines

11:34.250 --> 11:37.833
where they were to be used
in the war against our people.

11:37.917 --> 11:39.375
They have turned Babylon 5

11:39.458 --> 11:41.833
into a weapons supply post

11:41.917 --> 11:44.583
and we cannot allow
this to continue.

11:44.667 --> 11:48.958
Even if it means shutting down
Babylon 5 completely.

11:52.833 --> 11:54.083
(male announcer)
"36 Hours on Babylon 5"
continues

11:54.167 --> 11:55.250
with Cynthia Torqueman.

11:55.333 --> 11:56.667
According to figures released

11:56.750 --> 11:59.208
by the newly formed office
of public morale

11:59.292 --> 12:01.208
President William Clark
has risen

12:01.292 --> 12:03.417
to dramatic new levels
of popularity

12:03.500 --> 12:05.333
because of his
administration's emphasis

12:05.417 --> 12:07.375
on addressing
the needs of Earth.

12:07.458 --> 12:09.875
As a result,
recent hearings in Earth Dome

12:09.958 --> 12:12.833
have openly questioned
how much time and money

12:12.917 --> 12:14.458
should be invested in a project

12:14.542 --> 12:16.625
that seems perpetually
bogged down

12:16.708 --> 12:18.458
in non-human conflict.

12:18.542 --> 12:22.292
So we took that question
to Senator Ronald Quantrell.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.125
Well, obviously,
Babylon 5 is something

12:25.208 --> 12:26.958
President Santiago
believed in very strongly.

12:27.042 --> 12:30.250
And I think we owe it to his
memory to try and make it work.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.125
That doesn't exactly sound
like a ringing endorsement.

12:33.208 --> 12:36.333
Well, clearly we've
taken a lot of heat

12:36.417 --> 12:41.167
and the cost overruns have been
appropriately astronomical.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.958
But let's remember
that the Babylon Project

12:43.042 --> 12:45.792
was conceived right after
the Earth-Minbari war.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.083
At that time,
the idea of a diplomatic station

12:48.167 --> 12:50.500
designed to keep anything
like that from happening again

12:50.583 --> 12:52.208
was...very appealing.

12:52.292 --> 12:53.750
(Cynthia)
'And now?'

12:53.833 --> 12:55.042
Now?

12:56.083 --> 13:00.458
Well...still too early to tell.

13:00.542 --> 13:02.583
Certainly we've rebuilt
our military forces

13:02.667 --> 13:06.000
to a point far in advance of
where they were 14 years ago.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.917
If the Earth-Minbari war
started today

13:08.000 --> 13:11.667
I think things might have gone
a little differently.

13:11.750 --> 13:16.125
So while I'm not sure
how much concrete benefit

13:16.208 --> 13:20.583
we really derive from
Babylon 5 any longer

13:20.667 --> 13:24.750
I suppose it still does keep us
in a...highly visible position

13:24.833 --> 13:26.542
with other races

13:26.625 --> 13:28.167
and, of course,
it's very important

13:28.250 --> 13:30.500
to interstellar
commerce and trade.

13:32.375 --> 13:37.292
Well, with all due respect
to Senator Quantrell

13:37.375 --> 13:41.208
speaking as someone who
did his part in the front lines

13:41.292 --> 13:43.375
I'd have to say we still
haven't fully recovered

13:43.458 --> 13:45.208
from the Minbari war

13:45.292 --> 13:47.875
and we haven't anywhere near
the level of technology

13:47.958 --> 13:51.042
we would need in the event
of another major conflict.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.542
And anybody who thinks
that we could hold our own

13:53.625 --> 13:55.750
against the-the Minbari,
the Centauri

13:55.833 --> 14:00.333
and, God forbid, the Vorlons,
is just plain kidding himself.

14:00.417 --> 14:02.125
You sound angry about it.

14:02.208 --> 14:05.917
No...I'm not.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
I-it just, it just
sounds to me like-like

14:09.083 --> 14:13.125
jingoism and self-deception
and armchair quarterbacking.

14:13.208 --> 14:14.500
Anytime you lose a war

14:14.583 --> 14:16.458
you just, you just
wait a few years

14:16.542 --> 14:19.333
and you'll hear from everyone
who thought that we could've won

14:19.417 --> 14:20.958
if they've had done
the fighting.

14:21.042 --> 14:25.917
Except, of course, captain,
we didn't lose the war.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.125
'The Minbari did surrender.'

14:33.167 --> 14:35.083
Of course.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.625
(Cynthia)
Who are the people
who run Babylon 5

14:37.708 --> 14:39.625
and what do they do here?

14:39.708 --> 14:41.792
What are their hopes and dreams?

14:41.875 --> 14:44.042
I'm standing in what's called
the observation dome

14:44.125 --> 14:47.250
or C&amp;C,
short for Command and Control.

14:47.333 --> 14:48.917
When the captain
is otherwise engaged

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
with diplomatic
or business affairs

14:51.083 --> 14:52.708
this place is under
the watchful eye

14:52.792 --> 14:56.125
of its perky and energetic
commander, Susan Ivanova.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.500
(crew #1)
'We're all green down here.'

14:57.583 --> 14:58.875
Alright, make one more sweep

14:58.958 --> 15:01.375
pulling in whatever you got
then head for the barn.

15:01.458 --> 15:03.458
Commander Ivanova,
would you mind telling us

15:03.542 --> 15:04.958
what it is you're doing here?

15:05.042 --> 15:07.167
We're investigating
Ambassador G'Kar's allegations

15:07.250 --> 15:09.542
that the Centauri transport
was carrying weapons

15:09.625 --> 15:11.625
justifying
his government's attack.

15:11.708 --> 15:13.583
The HAZMAT team outside
is checking the debris

15:13.667 --> 15:15.417
'for any unusual levels
of radiation'

15:15.500 --> 15:16.958
'or trace elements
that could indicate'

15:17.042 --> 15:18.958
'the presence
of unauthorized weapons.'

15:19.042 --> 15:21.042
While we wait for the analysis
would you mind telling us

15:21.125 --> 15:23.583
a little about yourself?
How you got here?

15:23.667 --> 15:25.792
Well, there's really
not much to tell.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.708
I was born
in the Russian consortium

15:27.792 --> 15:30.250
but spent most of my life
at school abroad.

15:30.333 --> 15:32.333
Um, graduated from OTC
ten years ago.

15:32.417 --> 15:33.917
How did you
come to join Earthforce?

15:35.208 --> 15:37.042
After my brother Ganya
was killed in the war

15:37.125 --> 15:40.375
I felt that I had to try
and finish what he started.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.250
That of course, as my luck runs

15:42.333 --> 15:44.667
the war was over
before I saw any action.

15:44.750 --> 15:48.333
Now, commander, I'm sure there's
more to your story than that.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.292
Yes.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.875
What do I hope for?

15:54.958 --> 15:56.000
I hope to get through
this interview

15:56.083 --> 15:57.375
without getting myself fired.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.833
How's that for a start?

15:59.917 --> 16:01.042
I don't know,
it's one of those questions

16:01.125 --> 16:02.458
I don't think about in words

16:02.542 --> 16:05.042
maybe because so many times
it seems like

16:05.125 --> 16:08.542
if I say what I want,
it never comes.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.542
(Cynthia)
'There must be something.'

16:12.792 --> 16:14.208
Yeah.

16:14.292 --> 16:16.625
There are little hopes,
I guess.

16:19.625 --> 16:23.458
Every day I get up
and I hope nothing will happen.

16:23.542 --> 16:27.750
I'd love to be just bored
out of my skull for 24 hours.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.875
And, uh, I guess I keep hoping

16:30.958 --> 16:34.542
that someday, somewhere
I'll make a difference

16:34.625 --> 16:36.375
that at the end of the day

16:36.458 --> 16:37.875
everything that
we've gone through here

16:37.958 --> 16:41.125
for the past few years
will mean something.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.417
[beep]
Yeah.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.167
(Commander Ivanova)
'Garibaldi, we just got back
the HAZMAT report.'

16:46.250 --> 16:48.208
'We've got a problem.'

16:48.292 --> 16:49.250
See what I mean?

16:49.333 --> 16:51.083
Always something.

16:51.167 --> 16:52.958
So far we've spent most
of our time here

16:53.042 --> 16:54.542
talking to the humans.

16:54.625 --> 16:59.083
But aliens make up roughly 42%
of Babylon 5's population.

16:59.167 --> 17:02.625
Many of them live here
in the so-called Alien Sector

17:02.708 --> 17:04.583
which provides
alternate atmospheres

17:04.667 --> 17:06.458
for 14 different species.

17:06.542 --> 17:10.417
Ironically, the alien sector
is how the aliens here

17:10.500 --> 17:12.667
refer to the human part
of the station

17:12.750 --> 17:16.792
proving once again
that beauty and the beast

17:16.875 --> 17:19.208
are in the eye
of the beholder.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.458
Probably the most elusive
of all the aliens

17:26.542 --> 17:28.333
is Ambassador Kosh Nerannick

17:28.417 --> 17:30.625
a representative
of the Vorlon empire

17:30.708 --> 17:32.625
sent here roughly two years ago.

17:32.708 --> 17:34.292
Nothing is known of the Vorlons.

17:34.375 --> 17:37.625
In fact, three expeditions sent
into Vorlon space over the years

17:37.708 --> 17:39.125
have never returned.

17:39.208 --> 17:42.000
The Vorlon government said
they had met with accidents

17:42.083 --> 17:44.708
and suggested
no further expeditions.

17:44.792 --> 17:47.583
Even their appearance is a
mystery compounded by the fact

17:47.667 --> 17:49.750
that Ambassador Kosh
can only leave his quarters

17:49.833 --> 17:52.792
in an encounter suit
which contains his atmosphere

17:52.875 --> 17:54.833
and other life-support
equipment.

17:54.917 --> 17:57.458
A few moments ago, while we
were setting up this shot

17:57.542 --> 17:59.208
we got our first glimpse
of the Vorlon

17:59.292 --> 18:01.708
as he was leaving
his quarters just behind me.

18:01.792 --> 18:03.458
This is an ISN exclusive

18:03.542 --> 18:06.417
presented here
for the first time.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.917
(ISN cameraman)
'It's Ambassador Kosh
over here!'

18:08.000 --> 18:09.333
Mackey, quick!
The camera!

18:09.417 --> 18:11.333
'Ambassador Kosh!
Ambassador!'

18:11.417 --> 18:12.833
Cynthia Torqueman, ISN news.

18:12.917 --> 18:16.583
Can we ask you a few questions?
Ambassador Kosh!

18:16.667 --> 18:18.375
Did we get that?
Tell me we got that.

18:18.458 --> 18:19.708
Did we get it?

18:19.792 --> 18:21.083
Second in elusiveness

18:21.167 --> 18:22.833
to the Vorlon
is Ambassador Delenn

18:22.917 --> 18:24.583
of the Minbari federation.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.500
After initially refusing
several requests

18:26.583 --> 18:27.667
for an interview

18:27.750 --> 18:29.542
she finally agreed
to talk to us.

18:29.625 --> 18:31.458
Since very few humans

18:31.542 --> 18:33.167
have ever been allowed
on Minbar

18:33.250 --> 18:34.417
perhaps you could start
by telling us

18:34.500 --> 18:37.167
a little about your world.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.625
We are the seventh
planet from our sun.

18:39.708 --> 18:41.792
Almost one-quarter
of Minbar is covered

18:41.875 --> 18:44.292
by our North Polar ice cap.

18:44.375 --> 18:47.292
Because our world is rich
with crystalline deposits

18:47.375 --> 18:49.792
many of our cities
are cut directly out

18:49.875 --> 18:52.375
of crystal formations.

18:52.458 --> 18:55.958
During the spring, the patterns
of color caused by the light

18:56.042 --> 18:58.708
are...breathtaking.

19:00.667 --> 19:03.417
Let's see.
What else?

19:03.500 --> 19:05.875
We have, uh,
three basic languages.

19:05.958 --> 19:08.958
Len'au, Feek and Audronado

19:09.042 --> 19:11.125
which is the language
of the Religious Caste.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.708
Can you give us
an example of Audronado?

19:15.458 --> 19:17.750
[speaking in Audronado language]

19:20.833 --> 19:24.417
I'm your friend...in peace.

19:24.500 --> 19:28.625
Your appearance, though, isn't
typical of your people, is it?

19:30.333 --> 19:31.458
No.

19:31.542 --> 19:32.917
(Cynthia)
'According to station records'

19:33.000 --> 19:35.542
'you looked quite different
a year ago.'

19:35.625 --> 19:38.417
I volunteered for this change
in the hope that it would lead

19:38.500 --> 19:40.792
to a better understanding
between our peoples.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.750
Over a quarter of a million
humans were killed

19:42.833 --> 19:45.083
in the war with your people.

19:45.167 --> 19:47.542
'How do you think the families
of those victims will feel'

19:47.625 --> 19:50.833
'about your...change?'

19:50.917 --> 19:52.250
I, uh...I don't know.

19:54.708 --> 19:58.667
I, uh...I would hope..

19:58.750 --> 20:01.583
I think they would feel hurt.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.458
Betrayed.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.000
'That by assuming a human face'

20:05.083 --> 20:07.875
'you're taking a part of us
you're not entitled to.'

20:09.125 --> 20:11.125
'What would you say to them?'

20:11.208 --> 20:13.542
To all the husbands and wives

20:13.625 --> 20:15.417
and children and brothers
and sisters

20:15.500 --> 20:18.708
of the people who were killed
in the war with your people

20:18.792 --> 20:23.792
and now see a Minbari
with a human face?

20:23.875 --> 20:27.125
I'm, uh...I'm sorry.

20:27.208 --> 20:32.667
Can...can we,
can we stop this? Please?

20:32.750 --> 20:34.083
(Commander Ivanova on radio)
'Ambassador Delenn,
you're needed'

20:34.167 --> 20:35.958
'in the Council chambers.'

20:37.875 --> 20:39.250
'Ambassador.'

20:41.875 --> 20:43.500
'Ambassador Delenn.'

20:45.958 --> 20:47.250
We've just been informed
that there's been

20:47.333 --> 20:48.625
a new development
in the Narn attack.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.167
The Babylon 5 Advisory Council

20:50.250 --> 20:51.583
and the league
of non-aligned worlds

20:51.667 --> 20:53.083
have been convened
to hear this update.

20:53.167 --> 20:54.375
We've been given permission
to record

20:54.458 --> 20:55.625
these proceedings
in the Council chambers.

20:55.708 --> 20:56.833
And now, thanks to

20:56.917 --> 20:58.542
Commander Ivanova's
investigation

20:58.625 --> 21:01.333
we have proof of what
we've been saying all along.

21:01.417 --> 21:03.750
An inspection
of the destroyed Centauri

21:03.833 --> 21:05.250
has found conclusive proof

21:05.333 --> 21:07.083
that she was carrying
fusion bombs

21:07.167 --> 21:09.333
and support equipment
for ion cannons

21:09.417 --> 21:11.833
mass drivers,
and heavy-energy weapons.

21:11.917 --> 21:13.708
[shouting]

21:16.250 --> 21:17.875
Now, we have already filed
a complaint

21:17.958 --> 21:19.375
with the Centauri government

21:19.458 --> 21:22.500
on the grounds that Babylon 5
is neutral territory

21:22.583 --> 21:25.792
and is not to be used
as a staging ground

21:25.875 --> 21:26.958
or a munitions depot.

21:27.042 --> 21:28.333
If I may make
an observation--

21:28.417 --> 21:31.125
It is this kind of irresponsible
activity, ambassador

21:31.208 --> 21:34.250
that endangers this station
and everyone here!

21:34.333 --> 21:35.542
It will not be tolerated!

21:35.625 --> 21:37.667
...transferred outside
the station.

21:37.750 --> 21:38.875
Ship to ship.

21:38.958 --> 21:40.500
The risk to Babylon 5
is minimal.

21:40.583 --> 21:44.250
Oh, we've already seen your
minimal risk, ambassador.

21:44.333 --> 21:47.250
Caused by their attack
on one of our vessels.

21:47.333 --> 21:48.875
Our ships have the right

21:48.958 --> 21:50.792
to carry any cargo
they choose.

21:50.875 --> 21:52.875
We will not surrender
our sovereign rights.

21:52.958 --> 21:54.792
Sovereign rights
of any race end

21:54.875 --> 21:56.875
when they threaten innocents.

21:56.958 --> 21:58.875
They're doing
what they always do

21:58.958 --> 22:01.208
using details to distract us

22:01.292 --> 22:03.292
from doing what must be done!

22:03.375 --> 22:07.208
There are seven more Centauri
vessels berthed outside

22:07.292 --> 22:08.667
and I have reason to believe

22:08.750 --> 22:11.875
that they also carry weapons
of mass destruction

22:11.958 --> 22:13.458
to be used against our people.

22:13.542 --> 22:14.458
My government demands

22:14.542 --> 22:16.000
that these ships be impounded

22:16.083 --> 22:17.375
and their weapons seized!

22:17.458 --> 22:21.542
No, no, no!
We will not allow this!

22:21.625 --> 22:23.458
This is Babylon 5 space

22:23.542 --> 22:25.917
and here
we have sovereign rights.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.917
Our ships will
defend themselves

22:28.000 --> 22:30.625
against any
who try to seize them.

22:30.708 --> 22:34.167
Perhaps if the transports
return to Centauri space--

22:34.250 --> 22:35.458
No, we cannot
allow those ships

22:35.542 --> 22:37.125
to leave here
with their weapons.

22:37.208 --> 22:39.958
They'll just turn right around
and use them against us.

22:40.042 --> 22:41.625
Then how do you intend to..

22:41.708 --> 22:43.792
[rumbling]

22:43.875 --> 22:45.375
What the hell?

22:45.458 --> 22:47.250
Captain, we need you in C&amp;C.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.417
We've got a shooting war
going on out here.

22:59.917 --> 23:01.458
The sounds you hear
are heavy weapons

23:01.542 --> 23:02.917
on the Narn and Centauri vessels

23:03.000 --> 23:05.458
doing battle
just outside Babylon 5.

23:05.542 --> 23:07.458
The station is
on a priority one alert.

23:07.542 --> 23:09.583
And people are being
evacuated to shelters.

23:09.667 --> 23:12.333
We're en route to C&amp;C
to try and cover the battle.

23:12.417 --> 23:14.083
As we speak our vid systems
are being plugged

23:14.167 --> 23:15.958
into the station's
external cameras

23:16.042 --> 23:17.292
and communications systems.

23:17.375 --> 23:19.125
And we should be seeing..

23:19.208 --> 23:20.792
(crew member)
'Coming in, reading five.'

23:20.875 --> 23:23.792
'Repeat five incoming hostiles.
No reply.'

23:23.875 --> 23:27.583
'Got the beacon
targeting systems online.'

23:27.667 --> 23:29.458
(Captain Sheridan)
'Delta leader
to hostile vessels.'

23:29.542 --> 23:31.708
'You are ordered
to cease fire at once.'

23:31.792 --> 23:33.542
'Do you copy?'

23:33.625 --> 23:37.167
'You are ordered to surrender
or we will open fire.'

23:46.083 --> 23:47.542
Damage report.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.500
Levels Brown 90 through 92
report damage.

23:49.583 --> 23:52.083
Hull breech in Blue 70.
Dropping pressure doors!

23:52.167 --> 23:53.500
Get a repair crew
down there, stat.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.083
- 'Aye, sir.'
- Any reply yet?

23:55.167 --> 23:56.792
Negative. Hostile forces
continue to fire at each other.

23:56.875 --> 23:58.667
They've started
targeting our ships.

23:58.750 --> 24:00.458
(crew member)
'Delta squadron requesting
permission to fire.'

24:00.542 --> 24:02.125
Ambassadors Londo and G'Kar
are in the league.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.750
They're saying that if we open
fire on their vessels

24:03.833 --> 24:05.958
they'll consider it
an act of war.

24:10.042 --> 24:12.542
Screw them, we have a quarter
million people here to defend.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.167
If they won't stop this,
we will.

24:15.250 --> 24:17.792
All fighters, open fire.
Fire at will.

24:17.875 --> 24:19.625
(crew member)
'Roger, Babylon control.'

24:19.708 --> 24:21.792
'Delta squad, open fire.'

24:21.875 --> 24:24.250
'Target engines and
navigation if possible.'

24:24.333 --> 24:26.542
'But if you have
to take them out, do it.'

24:26.625 --> 24:27.625
(crew member)
'Roger, leader.'

24:27.708 --> 24:29.083
'Come on.'

24:29.167 --> 24:30.458
'Come on.'

24:30.542 --> 24:32.625
'Heaters lit.'

24:32.708 --> 24:35.125
'Come to papa.
Got it.'

24:35.208 --> 24:36.375
'Bombs away.'

24:36.458 --> 24:38.292
'This is 7.
Target's splashed.'

24:41.292 --> 24:43.542
'React, Team 12,
go to Blue 26..'

24:43.625 --> 24:44.917
Two Narn vessels destroyed.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.583
Two damaged
and out of the fight.

24:46.667 --> 24:48.500
Remaining Centauri vessels
are offering to surrender.

24:48.583 --> 24:49.625
Alright, pick them up,
bring them in

24:49.708 --> 24:51.375
and throw them in the brig.

24:51.458 --> 24:53.917
And I want every one of those
ships scanned for weapons.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.500
And tell Ambassadors G'Kar
and Londo

24:55.583 --> 24:57.000
I want to see them
in chambers now.

24:57.083 --> 24:58.500
What if they refuse?

24:58.583 --> 24:59.708
Then you can throw them in the--

24:59.792 --> 25:01.417
Ahem.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.583
(crew member)
'Security, there is a major riot
going on at the entrance..'

25:06.250 --> 25:07.250
Then invite them again

25:07.333 --> 25:09.625
as firmly and as
politely as you can.

25:09.708 --> 25:12.375
This nonsense
has gone far enough.

25:12.458 --> 25:13.750
'My main generator is down.'

25:13.833 --> 25:15.125
'And we're backed up.'

25:15.208 --> 25:16.167
(Cynthia)
'The nonsense'

25:16.250 --> 25:18.000
'Captain Sheridan referred to'

25:18.083 --> 25:19.917
'is the Narn-Centauri war'

25:20.000 --> 25:21.417
which, over the past
several months

25:21.500 --> 25:23.000
has grown into a conflict

25:23.083 --> 25:25.333
which threatens to spill
into other systems

25:25.417 --> 25:28.250
and lead to an escalation
of hostilities.

25:28.333 --> 25:30.000
Prior to the battle
we just witnessed

25:30.083 --> 25:33.417
ISN spoke with representatives
from both sides in order to

25:33.500 --> 25:36.458
better understand the history
of this conflict.

25:36.542 --> 25:41.875
Roughly 150 of your years ago
the Centauri came to our world.

25:43.667 --> 25:46.542
Narn was a green
and fertile place then.

25:46.625 --> 25:48.750
We greeted them in peace

25:48.833 --> 25:51.833
and spent the next
100 years in chains

25:51.917 --> 25:53.708
but we never gave up hope.

25:53.792 --> 25:56.292
We formed a resistance,
learned their secrets

25:56.375 --> 25:58.125
turned their own
machines against them

25:58.208 --> 26:00.417
and finally drove them
from our world.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.583
How did you become involved
with the resistance?

26:02.667 --> 26:03.917
[sighs]

26:06.625 --> 26:08.708
My family lived in G'Kamizad

26:08.792 --> 26:11.125
one of the larger
cities on Narn.

26:11.208 --> 26:15.500
My father served
in a Centauri household

26:15.583 --> 26:18.417
during the last years
of the rebellion.

26:18.500 --> 26:21.625
I was barely a pouchling
at the time.

26:21.708 --> 26:23.292
My mother was ill

26:23.375 --> 26:25.375
unable to escape
through the underground

26:25.458 --> 26:27.500
so we all stayed.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.167
It was a difficult time.

26:29.250 --> 26:32.042
We were striking deep
into Centauri resources.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.625
Things were tense.

26:34.708 --> 26:37.667
One day, my father spilled
a cup of hot jala

26:37.750 --> 26:39.958
on the mistress
of the house, and..

26:42.250 --> 26:44.375
..and she had him killed.

26:45.750 --> 26:47.833
They took him out,
tied his hands together

26:47.917 --> 26:51.542
and hung him from a jalwah tree
for three days.

26:53.500 --> 26:57.500
I came to him the last night,
against my mother's orders

26:57.583 --> 27:00.333
and he looked down at me.

27:00.417 --> 27:03.333
He said he was proud
and to go and fight

27:03.417 --> 27:06.708
and be all the things
he never was.

27:08.333 --> 27:11.167
Then he died.

27:11.250 --> 27:13.167
The next morning,
I ran away

27:13.250 --> 27:17.833
and killed
my first Centauri.

27:17.917 --> 27:19.958
Why do you think
they invaded back then?

27:20.042 --> 27:21.083
Ah!

27:21.167 --> 27:23.208
Why does any
advanced civilization

27:23.292 --> 27:26.333
seek to destroy
a less advanced one?

27:26.417 --> 27:28.875
Because the land is
strategically valuable.

27:28.958 --> 27:30.125
Because there are resources

27:30.208 --> 27:31.875
that can be cultivated
and exploited

27:31.958 --> 27:36.083
but most of all,
simply because they can.

27:36.167 --> 27:40.417
You have experienced much
the same on your own world.

27:40.500 --> 27:44.708
There are humans for whom
the words "Never again"

27:44.792 --> 27:48.000
carry special meaning
as they do for us.

27:50.167 --> 27:53.833
How do you respond to reports
that your military has lost six

27:53.917 --> 27:55.667
out of the last
seven engagements

27:55.750 --> 27:57.625
with the Centauri forces

27:57.708 --> 27:59.250
and now the war consists mainly

27:59.333 --> 28:01.750
of holding actions
and forced retreats?

28:01.833 --> 28:04.292
Centauri propaganda.

28:04.375 --> 28:08.000
We will never fall back.
We will never surrender!

28:10.292 --> 28:11.500
When we first met the Narn

28:11.583 --> 28:14.625
they were, what,
a primitive people.

28:14.708 --> 28:17.833
We gave them technology
centuries ahead of their own.

28:17.917 --> 28:19.958
Took them with us
to the stars.

28:20.042 --> 28:22.958
Taught them laws,
civilized them.

28:23.042 --> 28:25.917
They repaid us
with terror and death.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.625
So, you're saying
that the Centauri

28:27.708 --> 28:29.750
originally came
to help the Narn?

28:29.833 --> 28:33.500
Of course and at considerable
expense, I might add.

28:33.583 --> 28:35.625
Which is why we finally left.

28:35.708 --> 28:38.375
We wished them well,
but the cost, you've seen.

28:38.458 --> 28:41.375
Then you weren't driven off
the Narn homeworld?

28:41.458 --> 28:42.750
Please.

28:42.833 --> 28:46.375
The Narn have rewritten history
enough, don't you think?

28:46.458 --> 28:48.292
If they wanted us gone

28:48.375 --> 28:50.833
we were hardly going
to force the issue.

28:50.917 --> 28:52.125
But ever since

28:52.208 --> 28:55.750
they have grown more
and more irrational.

28:55.833 --> 28:58.458
Have gone out of their way
to harm us

28:58.542 --> 29:00.333
to seize entire territory.

29:00.417 --> 29:03.542
Finally, we had to take a stand.

29:03.625 --> 29:06.000
They were the ones who
declared war, remember?

29:06.083 --> 29:07.708
Not us.

29:07.792 --> 29:10.083
We want only peace.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.083
"We want only peace."

29:14.167 --> 29:15.667
Both sides
say the same thing

29:15.750 --> 29:16.958
but as we've just seen

29:17.042 --> 29:19.333
the reality is anything
but peaceful.

29:19.417 --> 29:21.000
With the skirmish
outside concluded

29:21.083 --> 29:22.458
and the captured
Centauri vessels

29:22.542 --> 29:24.292
about to undergo
a complete search

29:24.375 --> 29:25.875
things seem to have
calmed down a bit.

29:25.958 --> 29:27.000
What is it?

29:27.083 --> 29:28.667
Jump point forming
in Sector 7.

29:28.750 --> 29:31.125
Are they crazy?
That's practically on top of us!

29:31.208 --> 29:33.000
[explosion]

29:33.083 --> 29:35.000
(crew member)
'Reading one Centauri
battle cruiser.'

29:35.083 --> 29:37.250
Mackey, do we still have a feed
from the external monitors?

29:37.333 --> 29:38.625
Are they onli..

29:42.833 --> 29:44.917
I've got Ambassador Mollari
on the link.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
Put him through.

29:47.083 --> 29:49.125
Ambassador Mollari,
what the hell is going on here?

29:49.208 --> 29:52.083
I'm sorry this has come as
such a surprise, commander.

29:52.167 --> 29:55.042
But I warned you
not to interfere.

29:55.125 --> 29:58.667
You have no right to search
or detain our ships.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.542
If we don't act
in our own defense

30:00.625 --> 30:02.667
we invite the same from others.

30:02.750 --> 30:06.042
Centauri cruiser is arming
weapons, opening her gun ports.

30:06.125 --> 30:09.875
The cruiser will blockade
Babylon 5 until our ships

30:09.958 --> 30:12.042
are returned to
Centauri custody

30:12.125 --> 30:14.458
intact and unopened.

30:14.542 --> 30:17.875
Any ship attempting to enter
or leave Babylon 5

30:17.958 --> 30:21.333
will be fired upon,
boarded, and sent back.

30:21.417 --> 30:24.958
We will use the minimum
possible level of force.

30:25.042 --> 30:29.708
But if provoked, we are prepared
to use deadly force

30:29.792 --> 30:33.125
even against Babylon 5 itself.

30:33.208 --> 30:36.625
(male announcer)
ISN, the galaxy's most
important network.

30:41.167 --> 30:44.333
John, why aren't you outside
playing with the other kids?

30:44.417 --> 30:46.083
They hate me.

30:46.167 --> 30:47.292
Now, John--

30:47.375 --> 30:48.958
It's true.

30:49.042 --> 30:50.917
I'm just..

30:51.000 --> 30:53.125
I'm different, mom.

30:53.208 --> 30:58.250
I can feel what they think
about me and they know I can.

30:58.333 --> 30:59.583
I called one of them a liar

30:59.667 --> 31:02.625
because I knew he wasn't telling
the truth somehow.

31:02.708 --> 31:06.667
And he just kept hitting me
until I said I was the liar.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.667
I just don't know
what to do anymore.

31:10.000 --> 31:10.958
Don't worry, Johnny.

31:11.042 --> 31:12.167
We'll take care of it from here.

31:12.250 --> 31:13.833
Mom, look, a Psi Cop.

31:13.917 --> 31:15.583
That's right, Johnny.

31:15.667 --> 31:16.917
You know there are
a lot of other kids

31:17.042 --> 31:18.750
who feel just
the same way you do.

31:18.833 --> 31:22.042
They're confused and afraid,
but they don't have to be.

31:22.125 --> 31:24.625
The problem isn't that
other kids don't like you.

31:24.708 --> 31:28.250
Just that they don't
understand you, but we do.

31:28.333 --> 31:29.500
'You're special.'

31:29.583 --> 31:30.792
'You're a latent telepath'

31:30.875 --> 31:32.958
about to come into full bloom.

31:33.042 --> 31:34.833
My Johnny, a telepath?

31:34.917 --> 31:37.500
Probably, but to be sure,
take him down

31:37.583 --> 31:40.458
to the Psi Corps testing center
first thing tomorrow.

31:40.542 --> 31:41.625
How do I find one?

31:41.708 --> 31:43.708
We're everywhere,
for your convenience.

31:43.792 --> 31:46.583
We have offices in schools,
in children's hospitals.

31:46.667 --> 31:48.125
We even have mobile
testing centers

31:48.208 --> 31:50.833
that travel the country,
and if he qualifies

31:50.917 --> 31:54.625
we'll give him an education,
a job, a purpose.

31:54.708 --> 31:58.208
And we'll pay
all his bills for life.

31:58.292 --> 31:59.833
Oh, my.

31:59.917 --> 32:01.875
[chuckles]

32:01.958 --> 32:04.333
Oh, John,
I can't believe it.

32:04.417 --> 32:07.000
You've come so far.
Just look at you.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.583
We're all so proud.

32:08.667 --> 32:10.792
And I'm proud to be
part of the Psi Corps.

32:10.875 --> 32:14.042
So, remember, if you know
someone who might be a telepath

32:14.125 --> 32:16.000
or think you might
be one yourself

32:16.083 --> 32:19.417
help them get the help they
need. Call the Corps.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.958
(male announcer)
Call government information

32:21.042 --> 32:23.000
for more on a Psi Corps center
near you.

32:23.083 --> 32:24.333
This message has been
brought to you

32:24.417 --> 32:26.167
by the Ministry
for Public Information

32:26.250 --> 32:28.583
and your local Psi Corps
recruitment office.

32:31.583 --> 32:34.292
(Cynthia)
'As we enter our 30th hour
aboard Babylon 5'

32:34.375 --> 32:37.000
the Centauri-Narn crisis
has not diminished.

32:37.083 --> 32:38.625
The various parties
to the dispute

32:38.708 --> 32:40.667
have gathered
in Council chambers behind me

32:40.750 --> 32:43.542
in closed session
to discuss the crisis.

32:43.625 --> 32:46.333
Meanwhile, all traffic
in or out of Babylon 5

32:46.417 --> 32:49.917
has come to a halt,
due to the Centauri blockade.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.042
Captain, any progress
in the negotiations?

32:53.125 --> 32:55.875
All sides are still talking.
That's all I can say for now.

32:55.958 --> 32:57.333
Well, is it true that
some of the senate

32:57.417 --> 32:59.708
have suggested that you
accommodate the Centauri

32:59.792 --> 33:03.375
by releasing their vessels
without further searches?

33:03.458 --> 33:05.875
As the commander
of record on Babylon 5

33:05.958 --> 33:07.542
I doubt that the senate

33:07.625 --> 33:10.042
would attempt to undermine my
position in these negotiations

33:10.125 --> 33:12.583
by armchair quarterbacking.

33:16.125 --> 33:19.292
Ambassador G'Kar, do you
have anything to say?

33:19.375 --> 33:21.625
Only that this should
prove once and for all

33:21.708 --> 33:25.250
that the Centauri are a menace
to more than just our world.

33:25.333 --> 33:27.292
This kind of thing
cannot be allowed.

33:27.375 --> 33:28.958
And we will take whatever
steps necessary

33:29.042 --> 33:30.542
to make that perfectly
clear to them.

33:30.625 --> 33:34.292
Well, what does that mean?
A-Ambassador G'Kar?

33:34.375 --> 33:36.000
Certainly the events
on Babylon 5

33:36.083 --> 33:37.750
which took place
during your recent visit

33:37.833 --> 33:39.917
are emblematic of what
many of us on Earth Dome

33:40.000 --> 33:42.417
have been worried
about for sometime.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.208
By placing an Earth installation
between warring factions

33:45.292 --> 33:46.750
we risk being drawn
into a conflict

33:46.833 --> 33:50.667
that has nothing to do with us
or Earth interests.

33:50.750 --> 33:53.125
If we'd not been
in that place at that time

33:53.208 --> 33:55.458
a terrible loss of life
might have been avoided.

33:55.542 --> 33:58.625
On the other hand, senator, they
are at war with one another.

33:58.708 --> 34:00.583
People die in war.

34:00.667 --> 34:03.875
Yes, but it wouldn't have
happened in our backyard.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.125
What happened next came with

34:05.208 --> 34:06.792
the reluctant support
of Earthdome

34:06.875 --> 34:10.958
but, uh...hundreds of deaths.

34:11.042 --> 34:14.458
I don't see how we can support
that sort of thing.

34:16.167 --> 34:18.958
I'm only glad you made it out
alive, Cynthia.

34:19.042 --> 34:21.167
We need all the good
reporters we can get.

34:22.833 --> 34:24.292
Ten minutes ago,
Captain Sheridan

34:24.375 --> 34:25.583
received a coded transmission

34:25.667 --> 34:27.875
from Earthdome
on the current crisis.

34:27.958 --> 34:29.417
After considerable negotiations

34:29.500 --> 34:31.125
we've been allowed
back in to C&amp;C..

34:31.208 --> 34:34.542
Captain John Sheridan,
Babylon 5, to Centauri cruiser.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.125
My government
has rejected your demand

34:38.208 --> 34:39.667
that we release your ships.

34:39.750 --> 34:44.167
We will not consider any demand
made under terrorist threat.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.125
We have activated our defense
grid and are prepared

34:47.208 --> 34:50.000
to defend all ships
coming through here.

34:50.083 --> 34:51.833
Any hostile action taken by you

34:51.917 --> 34:55.000
against ships entering
or leaving this station

34:55.083 --> 34:58.833
will be considered an attack
on Babylon 5 itself

34:58.917 --> 35:01.208
and we will respond accordingly.

35:03.167 --> 35:05.417
If they send back a reply,
don't acknowledge it.

35:05.500 --> 35:06.542
'Aye, captain.'

35:06.625 --> 35:07.875
We'll let them
sweat for a while.

35:07.958 --> 35:09.875
I hope this works,
I know that a defense grid

35:09.958 --> 35:11.500
can probably hold them off,
but the repercussions--

35:11.583 --> 35:13.917
Ah, they're bluffing.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.792
I can't believe they'd take on
the whole station.

35:17.875 --> 35:19.833
Now that bring Earth
on the side of the Narn's.

35:19.917 --> 35:25.208
And the last thing the Centauri
want is a war on two fronts.

35:25.292 --> 35:27.000
'Docking Bay 9 just linked in.'

35:27.083 --> 35:29.375
'The transport's ready to go.'

35:29.458 --> 35:33.000
Bring her up.
Activate autopilot.

35:33.083 --> 35:34.958
We'll run the transport
from here

35:35.042 --> 35:37.333
make sure no one gets hurt.

35:37.417 --> 35:39.458
Just in case
they're not bluffing.

35:41.625 --> 35:44.542
Bring the Maintenance Bots
around for a closer look.

35:44.625 --> 35:47.042
(crew member)
'Move Secure Cam 23
to high overhead'

35:47.125 --> 35:51.042
'and Maint Bot 9 through 14
at 12 click intervals..'

35:51.125 --> 35:52.583
You realize if they do
attack the transport

35:52.667 --> 35:54.583
they'll turn right around
and fire on us next

35:54.667 --> 35:57.542
figuring we'll have to
retaliate?

35:57.625 --> 35:58.708
I know.

36:03.125 --> 36:05.708
(crew member)
'Transport, maintain approach..'

36:05.792 --> 36:08.000
All tracking stations

36:08.083 --> 36:12.750
if you see their weapons
targeting us...open fire.

36:18.458 --> 36:20.250
Any reply from the cruiser?

36:20.333 --> 36:22.208
'Negative, sir. No response.'

36:22.292 --> 36:24.000
Their weapons system
is still armed.

36:24.083 --> 36:25.333
I don't like this.

36:27.667 --> 36:28.917
[beeping]

36:40.042 --> 36:41.917
Well, the transport's through.
We called their bluff.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.833
(crew member)
'Getting a signal
from the Centauri cruiser.'

36:43.917 --> 36:45.750
'They want to talk.'

36:45.833 --> 36:47.750
Open a channel.
Let's be gracious about this.

36:47.833 --> 36:50.042
Captain, any thoughts
on the--

36:50.125 --> 36:52.417
Second jump point forming
in Sector 10.

36:58.667 --> 37:01.292
- Looks like a Narn.
- Oh, hell.

37:01.375 --> 37:02.917
Babylon control to Narn cruiser.

37:03.000 --> 37:06.583
We do not, repeat,
we do not require assistance.

37:06.667 --> 37:07.958
Do not interfere.

37:08.042 --> 37:09.792
We have the situation
under control.

37:09.875 --> 37:12.792
(crew member)
'Narn cruiser powering-up
weapons systems.'

37:12.875 --> 37:15.167
No. Listen to me.

37:15.250 --> 37:16.708
We do not need..

37:28.042 --> 37:29.000
(crew member)
'Firing.'

37:29.083 --> 37:30.667
'Back again.
A Centauri hit.'

37:30.750 --> 37:32.625
All civilians to the shelters.

37:32.708 --> 37:35.625
Get me that cruiser.
I don't care how you do it.

37:35.708 --> 37:36.833
'Aye, sir.'

37:38.042 --> 37:39.167
'Security, heavy damage.'

37:44.292 --> 37:46.500
Close blast doors now.

37:48.625 --> 37:49.958
Ah!

38:00.083 --> 38:01.542
Narns have destroyed
the Centauri cruiser.

38:01.625 --> 38:02.708
They're trying to
open a jump point.

38:02.792 --> 38:03.917
Can they make it?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.167
I don't think so.
They're hit bad.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.875
Jump engines are malfunctioning.

38:07.958 --> 38:10.000
[dramatic music]

38:25.917 --> 38:29.042
As journalists, we would be
remiss in our responsibilities

38:29.125 --> 38:31.833
if we suggested that events such
as those you've just witnessed

38:31.917 --> 38:34.542
were typical of the
situation on Babylon 5.

38:34.625 --> 38:37.958
Like anyone else, they have
good days and bad days.

38:38.042 --> 38:40.458
But there can be no question
that it is a flash point

38:40.542 --> 38:43.208
that can only grow hotter
as time passes.

38:43.292 --> 38:46.333
And yet growth only comes
through pain and struggle.

38:46.417 --> 38:49.458
So, perhaps we should allow
Babylon 5 time to realize

38:49.542 --> 38:51.917
or, one day,
even exceed the dreams

38:52.000 --> 38:54.208
we have invested in it.

38:54.292 --> 38:56.083
We'll be back with
some concluding thoughts

38:56.167 --> 38:58.250
right after this message.

39:01.250 --> 39:02.583
After the crisis was over

39:02.667 --> 39:04.708
the debris cleared
and the bodies counted

39:04.792 --> 39:05.958
we asked each of the people

39:06.042 --> 39:08.375
involved in this story
one question.

39:08.458 --> 39:10.333
Given the danger,
at the end of the day

39:10.417 --> 39:14.042
as Mr. Garibaldi said,
is it worth it?

39:14.125 --> 39:15.750
Absolutely.

39:15.833 --> 39:18.750
Sure, when things get tense
out here, we have to be careful.

39:18.833 --> 39:20.833
Our search of the Centauri
vessels we captured

39:20.917 --> 39:23.125
proved they were bringing in
weapons of mass destruction

39:23.208 --> 39:24.583
offloading them
outside the station

39:24.667 --> 39:26.083
and sending them on
to the front lines.

39:26.167 --> 39:27.458
Now that we know that

39:27.542 --> 39:29.458
we can make sure it doesn't
happen anymore.

39:29.542 --> 39:30.875
We learn.

39:30.958 --> 39:32.125
That's what humans do.

39:32.875 --> 39:35.708
Misunderstandings aside

39:35.792 --> 39:39.917
yes, I definitely think
it's worth it.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.667
We must simply work harder

39:42.750 --> 39:45.542
to make sure we communicate
with one another

39:45.625 --> 39:49.583
to prevent this sort of
tragic situation

39:49.667 --> 39:52.458
from ever happening again.

39:52.542 --> 39:57.292
A violent attack by Narn forces
is an unacceptable response

39:57.375 --> 40:00.250
to a peaceful protest
by my government.

40:00.333 --> 40:02.042
And with the intervention
of Earth

40:02.125 --> 40:04.500
perhaps...we can keep them

40:04.583 --> 40:08.000
from making a similar
mistake in the future.

40:09.333 --> 40:11.458
I don't know anymore.

40:11.542 --> 40:14.875
I used to think so,
but now..

40:14.958 --> 40:16.125
Yes.

40:16.208 --> 40:18.875
Of course it is,
for the simple reason

40:18.958 --> 40:22.208
that no one else would ever
build a place like this.

40:22.292 --> 40:25.667
Humans share one unique quality.

40:25.750 --> 40:27.667
They build communities.

40:27.750 --> 40:30.042
If the Narns or the Centauri

40:30.125 --> 40:32.167
or any other race built
a station like this

40:32.250 --> 40:35.208
it would be used only
by their own people.

40:35.292 --> 40:39.000
But everywhere humans go,
they create communities

40:39.083 --> 40:43.167
out of diverse and sometimes
hostile populations.

40:43.250 --> 40:47.750
It is a great gift
and a terrible responsibility.

40:47.833 --> 40:51.750
One that cannot be abandoned.

40:51.833 --> 40:53.458
Well..

40:53.542 --> 40:56.667
I guess we'll just
have to see...won't we?

40:59.542 --> 41:02.292
Alright, Med 2.
Go, go!

41:02.375 --> 41:04.250
Look, if we weren't
here right now

41:04.333 --> 41:06.958
half the people
in this room would be dead.

41:07.042 --> 41:10.167
Now, that should be a good
enough answer for anyone.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.208
Sure.
What, are you kidding?

41:12.292 --> 41:15.542
I have a retirement pension
to make, you know?

41:15.625 --> 41:16.875
Yes.

41:18.833 --> 41:23.000
But not for any of the reasons
that you've probably been told.

41:25.958 --> 41:30.208
The job of Babylon 5
is not to enforce the peace.

41:30.292 --> 41:33.375
It's to create the peace.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.958
And this place was built
on the assumption that

41:36.042 --> 41:40.500
we could work out our problems
and build a better future.

41:40.583 --> 41:44.000
And that, to me,
is the key issue.

41:46.458 --> 41:51.333
See, in the last few years,
we've stumbled.

41:51.417 --> 41:54.583
We stumbled at the death
of the president, the war

41:54.667 --> 41:57.875
and on and on.

41:57.958 --> 42:02.417
And when you stumble a lot, you,
you start looking at your feet.

42:04.500 --> 42:09.292
You know, we have to make
people...lift their eyes

42:09.375 --> 42:11.000
back to the horizon

42:11.083 --> 42:15.917
and see the line of ancestors
behind us saying

42:16.000 --> 42:18.208
"Make my life have meaning."

42:19.917 --> 42:23.792
And to our inheritors
before us saying

42:23.875 --> 42:27.125
"Create the world
we will live in."

42:28.958 --> 42:31.292
I mean, we're not just

42:31.375 --> 42:33.042
holding jobs and having dinner.

42:33.125 --> 42:37.125
We are in the process
of building the future.

42:37.208 --> 42:39.542
That's what Babylon 5
is all about.

42:41.167 --> 42:45.125
Only by making people
understand that

42:45.208 --> 42:49.417
can we hope to...create a better
world for ourselves

42:51.792 --> 42:53.333
and our posterity.

42:55.208 --> 42:57.958
I'm Cynthia Torqueman,
ISN news.

42:58.042 --> 42:59.292
Goodnight.
