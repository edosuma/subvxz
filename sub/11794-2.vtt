00:02.035 --> 00:03.737
( bell rings )

00:03.770 --> 00:06.873
 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
 <i>morning and</i>
 <i>the alarm gives out a warning</i>

00:06.906 --> 00:09.709
 <i>* I don't think I'll ever</i>
 <i>make it on time</i>

00:09.743 --> 00:12.779
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.812 --> 00:16.282
 <i>* I'm at</i>
 <i>the corner just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.315 --> 00:20.553
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.955 --> 00:24.824
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:27.827
   <i>* And my dog ate</i>
   <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.861 --> 00:30.897
 <i>* Ridin' low on my chair</i>
 <i>she won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.930 --> 00:34.501
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
<i>It will be all right</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:38.605
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:53.119 --> 00:56.423
   <i>* It's all right</i>

00:56.456 --> 00:58.958

<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:16.676 --> 01:18.745
   We just got report cards.

01:18.778 --> 01:21.081
 Jessie got all A's...

01:21.081 --> 01:23.350
 Her parents bought her
 flowers.

01:23.383 --> 01:24.784
   Kelly got B's...

01:25.985 --> 01:29.456
 Her parents bought her
 an ice cream.

01:29.489 --> 01:32.092
  I haven't figured out
  what to buy my parents yet.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.394
   But Lisa made honor roll,

01:34.427 --> 01:36.096
   and you should see
   what her father gave her.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.733
Where's Lisa? I can't wait
to see her new outfit.

01:39.766 --> 01:43.536
  Me too.
  She's my reason for being.

01:43.570 --> 01:46.673
 I cannot believe her father
 gave her his credit card
 to go to the mall.

01:46.706 --> 01:51.111
I know.
It's like letting a vampire
loose in a blood bank.

01:51.144 --> 01:54.714
 Watch it, Dimples.
 That's my fox
 you're talking about.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.951
  Screech,
  she's not your fox.

01:57.984 --> 02:00.053
Why don't you just find
another chick?

02:00.053 --> 02:02.889
Whoa! May I remind you both
that we are girls?

02:02.922 --> 02:04.791
 We are not "foxes"
 not '"chicks"

02:04.824 --> 02:07.327
nor any other
cute little animal
you boys like.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.562
   - Do you understand?
   - Sure, "Kitten."

02:11.931 --> 02:13.767
 Food's here.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.704
 Compliments
 of my new magic serving cart.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.074
Zack: So where's the magic,
Max?

02:21.074 --> 02:23.343
  Oh, it's...

02:23.743 --> 02:25.445
Voila!

02:30.450 --> 02:31.785
  How do you like it?

02:31.818 --> 02:34.654
 I love it, but didn't your
 father say to just buy
 something nice?

02:34.688 --> 02:37.424
  I couldn't help myself.
  I caught such great sales.

02:37.457 --> 02:38.925
All my clothes
were half-off.

02:38.958 --> 02:43.096
  Half-off?
  I can't take this tension.

02:43.129 --> 02:46.466
 Lisa, I think you better
 total up everything you
 bought right now.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.901
Really?

02:47.934 --> 02:52.138
 I have a calculator on
 my watch. You can use it if
 you hold my wrist.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.407
Screech, heel.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.509
  - Where are the receipts?
  - Here.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.048
   $62 for the top,

03:02.082 --> 03:04.617
  $1 26 for the jacket
  and shorts,

03:04.651 --> 03:07.620
 and $198
 for the boots, purse

03:07.654 --> 03:09.155
and "Maneater" perfume?

03:09.189 --> 03:13.126
   - Come on, what's the total?
   - $386.

03:13.159 --> 03:17.130
  $386?
  You think I went overboard?

03:17.163 --> 03:21.067
  - Like the crew
  of the <i>Titanic.</i>
  - This is serious.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.737
 Lisa, when your father
 finds out, you are going to
 get in trouble.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.973
   Oh come on.
   I'm Daddy's little girl.

03:27.073 --> 03:30.577
 If you want to
 live to be Daddy's
 big girl, take the stuff back.

03:30.610 --> 03:33.513
 Lisa, I think you should keep
 one thing and return the rest.

03:33.546 --> 03:36.149
   Maybe you're right.
   I have to go
   back to the mall anyway.

03:36.182 --> 03:38.084
   They're having
   a big shoe sale.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.655
 I got here as soon as I could.
 What's going on?

03:42.689 --> 03:45.658
 Lisa's running away...
 The store wouldn't let her
 return her clothes.

03:45.692 --> 03:46.960
  Oh.

03:46.993 --> 03:49.129
   Lisa, running away
   isn't the answer.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.197
  Do what I do
  when l do something wrong.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.900
   - What's that?
   - Enjoy it, then deny it.

03:56.636 --> 03:58.805
   Lisa,
   when you do something wrong,
   you should admit it.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.474
What do you do, Kelly?

04:01.508 --> 04:03.943
Well, gee. I can't remember
doing anything wrong.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.881
 Oh, shut up!

04:10.050 --> 04:13.186
I'm sorry.
I'm just upset.

04:13.219 --> 04:15.055
Lisa, no matter
what I've done,

04:15.088 --> 04:17.089
   I've always been
   direct and honest
   with my parents.

04:17.123 --> 04:20.459
 I'm with Jessie.
 The truth is easiest,
 and it works.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.095
  But I can't tell my father.

04:22.128 --> 04:25.165
  Then why don't
  you tell your mother
  and pay her to keep quiet?

04:25.198 --> 04:28.702
 - Pay her with what?
 - Put it on the card.
 Why stop now?

04:30.136 --> 04:33.073
   Lisa, why can't you tell
   your father?

04:33.073 --> 04:35.742
   Because I don't know
   how he'll react.

04:39.546 --> 04:40.980
 ( knocking )

04:41.614 --> 04:43.516
   Come in.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.785
 - Hi, sweetheart.
 - Hi, Daddy.

04:45.819 --> 04:48.555
  What did you want to talk
  to me about?

04:48.588 --> 04:50.890
  Daddy, I don't know
  what to do.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.693
   I've made a big mistake.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.696
I'm sure it's not that bad,
Princess.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.165
Tell your father.
He knows best.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.236
 Okay.

05:03.269 --> 05:06.673
 Daddy, I've run up a $400 bill
 on your credit card.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.042
 ( thunder crashing )

05:09.042 --> 05:11.111
   ( booming voice )
   You what?

05:11.144 --> 05:13.613
  I'm sorry.

05:13.646 --> 05:17.550
   Who's the worst
   daughter of all?

05:17.584 --> 05:21.054
   Lisa, Lisa, Lisa!

05:22.055 --> 05:23.623
You...

05:23.656 --> 05:26.626
   Are a father's
   worst nightmare.

05:31.197 --> 05:33.066
What's happened to me?

05:34.734 --> 05:37.103
I'm not Daddy's little girl
anymore.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.978
 He's going to kill me.
 I know it.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.947
   Don't panic.
   All you have to do
   is pay your father back.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.583
   Yeah, but where am
   I going to get the money?

05:50.617 --> 05:53.153
  Ask for a $400 advance
  on your allowance.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.622
  Why don't you try
  to earn the money?

05:55.655 --> 05:58.091
  Earn money?
 <i>Moi?</i>

05:58.124 --> 06:01.728
This sounds like a job
for "Zackman."

06:07.534 --> 06:09.636
 Do you really think we're
 going to make
 a lot of money today?

06:09.669 --> 06:11.738
 We're going to be raking it in
 all day.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.606
- Starting now.
- How?

06:13.640 --> 06:18.278
Lisa, sit down, look pretty
and trust me.

06:18.311 --> 06:21.715
  Hey guys come on,
  crowd around, crowd around.

06:24.684 --> 06:26.453
 ( school bell rings )

06:27.721 --> 06:29.789
  Okay, settle down.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.625
   - Good morning, class.
   - Students: Good morning.

06:32.659 --> 06:36.363
   Resume where we
   left off yesterday.
   You all know the chapter.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.398
You mean Reproduction
in the Animal Kingdom?

06:38.431 --> 06:43.370
 Well, I prefer to call it,
 "Monkey Business
 in the Jungle."

06:43.403 --> 06:44.938
 I read the chapter last night,

06:44.971 --> 06:48.274
 but I'm still not clear
 who does what to whom and how.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.977
  Yeah, and how come birds
  aren't attracted to horses?

06:51.077 --> 06:52.679
   Oh, but they are.

06:52.712 --> 06:56.249
 Unfortunately there just isn't
 enough room in the nest.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.653
   Today's topic is,

07:00.687 --> 07:04.724
  "The Pond:
  Nature's Hot Tub."

07:04.758 --> 07:06.626
   Could you write
   on the board again,
   your list

07:06.659 --> 07:08.928
- of Pond
Playmates of the Month?
- All right,

07:09.029 --> 07:12.432
  we'll start with the Beatles,
  then throw in
  some Rolling Stones.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.869
  Teacher:
  Does anyone know the sound

07:15.902 --> 07:19.606
the male frog makes
to attract the female?

07:20.306 --> 07:22.409
  ( shrieks )

07:22.442 --> 07:25.879
 No, that's
 the little boy porcupine
 getting too close to his mate.

07:27.547 --> 07:30.216
 The male frog goes...

07:30.250 --> 07:33.453
( croaks )
Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.924
  That's merely
  his way of saying,

07:37.957 --> 07:40.627
   your pad or mine?

07:40.660 --> 07:44.531
 Now, insect love
 on the other hand,
 can be very, very dangerous.

07:44.564 --> 07:49.469
   An unwelcome suitor is often
   driven off by
   terrifying threats.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.938
   Get away, creeps!

07:51.971 --> 07:54.074
 Oh no.
 Much worse than that.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.812
Like...
( screeching )

08:01.281 --> 08:02.515
Try it, try it.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.852
  ( all screeching )

08:05.885 --> 08:10.557
 Good, very good.
 Excellent. Wonderful.

08:10.590 --> 08:13.326
  Wonderful.
  You really have it.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.061
 ( P.A. signal beeps )

08:15.095 --> 08:17.597
   <i>Good morning, students.</i>
   <i>This is your principal, Mr.</i>
   <i>Belding.</i>

08:17.630 --> 08:19.632
 ( all groan )

08:19.666 --> 08:22.502
  Thank you.

08:22.535 --> 08:26.406
 I want to remind you,
 our charity
 drive will continue all week.

08:26.439 --> 08:29.542
 So please put all clothing
 and canned goods in the gym,

08:29.576 --> 08:33.279
  and not on top of my car,
  no matter what
  Zack Morris says.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.448
 ( laughter )

08:35.482 --> 08:39.419
 <i>It's also time for our annual</i>
 <i>Earthquake Drill.</i>

08:39.452 --> 08:42.856
 Yes, when that
 siren sounds,

08:42.889 --> 08:45.725
 get down,
 'cause there'll be...

08:45.759 --> 08:49.095
 A whole lot of shakin'
 goin' on.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.865
  ( Belding laughs )

08:53.700 --> 08:55.101
( siren wails )

08:55.135 --> 08:57.704
   All right, everybody,
   climb under your tables,

08:57.737 --> 08:59.906
like burrowing badgers.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.714
 Screech:
 Lisa!

09:10.717 --> 09:13.019
   ( gasps )

09:15.755 --> 09:17.490
   ( gasps )

09:19.726 --> 09:21.428
  ( screams )

09:22.395 --> 09:24.831
How could you
do this to me?

09:24.864 --> 09:27.834
 Hey Lisa,  Ithought you wanted
 to kiss your debt goodbye.

09:27.867 --> 09:29.736
   Not with my lips.

09:29.769 --> 09:32.539
   I feel so...
   So cheap.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.741
Lisa, you're not cheap.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.544
 You made $36.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.813
   So I just have to press
   this button to open them?

09:39.846 --> 09:41.514
  That's all.
  I wired everything.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.483
Are you sure I have nothing
to worry about?

09:43.516 --> 09:45.785
  You might lose your hair
  when you're older.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.754
   I mean now.
   How about now, you yo-yo?

09:47.787 --> 09:49.889
   You're too young
   to lose it now, dipstick!

09:52.726 --> 09:54.594
   Zack, do we really
   have to do this?

09:54.627 --> 09:56.730
   Lisa, we only have
   two-and-a-half days left.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.799
If you want to raise money,
you'll have to
sell your clothes.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.736
   All right, you guys know
   what to do.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.939
 Don't worry about it, Preppie.
 We'll take care of Belding.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.078
 All right everybody,

10:12.112 --> 10:16.182
  the Lisa Special Sale
  is about to begin.

10:19.886 --> 10:24.224
   Okay, what am I bid
   for this lovely lingerie?

10:24.257 --> 10:27.460
  Worn by Lisa
  while dreaming of Screech.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.696
  - My entire life savings!
  - Sold!

10:30.697 --> 10:31.898
It's only two dollars.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.934
 Two dollars?
 That cost 20!

10:36.002 --> 10:38.638
It will lie next to me
every night in my bed.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.674
I thought you slept
with your dog.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.108
He won't mind.

10:44.844 --> 10:48.782
Okay, how much am I bid
for these cowboy boots?

10:48.815 --> 10:52.052
Almost brand new.
Worn only once by Lisa

10:52.085 --> 10:54.521
while she was watching
a rodeo on TV.

10:54.554 --> 10:57.791
- Six dollars.
- Sold!

10:57.824 --> 10:59.526
   How much am I bid
   for the left one?

10:59.559 --> 11:01.594
 - Four dollars.
 - You got it!

11:02.896 --> 11:05.532
 That's what I call
 a ''matching pair.''

11:06.566 --> 11:09.736
Okay, how much am I bid
for this wig?

11:09.769 --> 11:13.106
  Worn by Lisa during her
  Tina Turner phase.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.574
 ( boy yells )
 Four dollars!

11:14.607 --> 11:18.078
  Sold to Rocco.
  No questions asked.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.080
Hey, Belding is coming.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.915
 Closing them!

11:25.518 --> 11:27.620
   - Hi, Mr. Belding.
   - Hello, Morris.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.689
He's on to us, Zack.
I know it, we're dead!

11:29.723 --> 11:32.592
- Hi, Screech.
- Hello, goodbye.
Let's do lunch.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.962
 Hmm.

11:39.599 --> 11:42.102
 Let the sale resume!

11:44.270 --> 11:46.973
 Belding!
 He's ba-ack!

11:47.807 --> 11:49.576
 Closing them!

11:53.113 --> 11:55.148
  Are you hiding something,
  Zachary?

11:55.181 --> 11:56.649
   - Me?
   - Uh-huh.

11:56.683 --> 12:00.720
 Mr. Belding, sir.
 I need your opinion.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.189
  I was wondering,
  what do you think of this?

12:03.223 --> 12:05.558
  It's all right, l guess.
  Is it for your girlfriend?

12:05.592 --> 12:08.561
 No, sir.
 It's for me.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.930
  I'd like to wear it
  to school tomorrow.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.566
 Come into my office,
 young lady... Slater.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.570
 Now.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.675
 You think moving
 from school to school

12:21.708 --> 12:23.810
 has caused an identity crisis?

12:23.843 --> 12:26.279
 I'm not sure who I am
 anymore, sir.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.581
All l know is that
I'm a size six.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.918
 I would have
 guessed a 12.

12:32.852 --> 12:34.821
  I'm confused, sir.

12:34.854 --> 12:38.191
   You know,
   maybe I'm trying too hard
   to get girls to like me.

12:38.224 --> 12:40.960
  Hey, now I can
  identify with that.

12:43.229 --> 12:44.864
 This may come
 as a surprise to you,

12:44.898 --> 12:48.101
   but when I was your age,
   l wasn't...

12:48.101 --> 12:50.970
  Well, you know...
  The hunk I am now.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.709
  I can't believe this, sir.

12:55.742 --> 12:58.945
  No, I thought
  you were stud city.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.715
Everybody thinks that.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.284
   No, I never had a date
   until l was in the Army.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.253
  And even she
  was with the enemy.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.191
 Tell me more.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.827
  In high school,
  I was such a geek.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.962
  I had to go to the prom
  with my own sister.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.330
 I was so embarrassed.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.067
 Let it out, big guy.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.236
  Lean on me.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.073
 Attention shoppers,
 for two minutes only,

13:27.073 --> 13:28.908
  the Lisa Beach Collection,

13:28.942 --> 13:32.078
 what the well-dressed teenager
 will be wearing this summer.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.214
   Screech, hit it.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.850
( music plays )

13:39.819 --> 13:42.889
  And now for the beautiful
  and enchanting...

13:42.922 --> 13:46.326
 Kelly,
 Goddess of the Sand.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.195
( whistles, cheering )

13:53.133 --> 13:56.236
   Oh my gosh,
   she's in a bathing suit!

13:57.704 --> 13:59.439
 The bidding is open.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.608
  The bidding is closed.
  Sold to me for $12.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.309
Thank you, Kelly.
Go get dressed.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.178
  Stay away
  from these animals.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.615
 After the war,
 I was dateless again.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.686
  That Viet Cong girl
  dumped me.

14:15.088 --> 14:19.125
   But then I went
   to college and met
   the future Mrs. Belding.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.062
 See, she was on the swim team,
 and I was a towel boy.

14:23.329 --> 14:26.299
I tripped, hit my head,
fell into the water...

14:26.332 --> 14:27.834
  She saved my life.

14:28.802 --> 14:31.705
Wow, that's a beautiful
story, sir.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.873
I'll never forget
her first words to me,

14:33.907 --> 14:35.675
 "Don't swallow your tongue."

14:36.242 --> 14:38.078
 ( intercom buzzing )

14:40.213 --> 14:41.648
 Yes?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.917
<i>Mr. Belding,</i>
<i>maintenance wants you</i>
<i>in the boys' bathroom.</i>

14:43.950 --> 14:46.720
<i>Someone flushed</i>
<i>Mr. Fetterman's toupee.</i>

14:48.388 --> 14:50.290
 I'll be right there.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.759
 Wait!

14:54.527 --> 14:56.296
 What's going on here?

14:57.997 --> 15:01.101
 Oh, we're just standing around
 doing macho guy stuff

15:01.134 --> 15:03.169
  next to a bunch
  of women's clothes.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.038
   Who's are these, anyway?

15:05.038 --> 15:08.408
 Uh... Lisa's sir. I helped her
 bring them to school today.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.744
  Yeah, Lisa needs
  to get rid of them.

15:10.777 --> 15:15.048
  This is the most generous act
  I've ever
  witnessed at this school.

15:15.048 --> 15:19.085
Imagine one person donating
all this to our
clothing drive.

15:19.119 --> 15:22.288
  - But, sir!
  - And you of all
  people helping her.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.959
 - I'm getting chills, brother.
 - I'm getting sweats.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.495
 You know what?
 Lisa has done enough.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.231
   Let's all take this
   to the gym for her, huh?

15:35.902 --> 15:38.738
We only made $53
selling Lisa's clothes,

15:38.772 --> 15:41.207
so she had to do the most
humiliating, insulting,

15:41.241 --> 15:44.644
  degrading thing
  possible for her...
  Get a job!

15:44.678 --> 15:46.379
   How's she doing?

15:50.884 --> 15:52.452
 Let me put it another way...

15:52.485 --> 15:54.621
  If Lisa were a car,
  she'd be recalled.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.090
I'm sorry, Max!

15:57.090 --> 15:59.693
 That's okay, it's only
 the third tray you've dropped.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.261
 Don't worry about it.

16:02.562 --> 16:05.298
  See? I had the kitchen
  velcro your orders.

16:05.899 --> 16:08.168
Thanks.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.803
  So, did you get more tips?

16:09.836 --> 16:13.206
  Yeah, I got a tip.
  Alan Seltzer
  told me to get another job.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.608
   Waitress, can I have
   a glass of water?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.510
   Get it yourself!

16:17.544 --> 16:20.280
  Lisa, you're a waitress.
  You have to wait on people.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.582
 Zack, he just wants
 to soak his retainer.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.351
   Waitress!

16:24.384 --> 16:26.653
 How can I work
 with all these people
 bothering me?

16:32.625 --> 16:33.960
 So what's the total?

16:34.060 --> 16:37.597
 Well, so far Lisa's earned
 $3.10 in tips.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.466
  Kelly:
  Who gave you the 10 cents?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.701
   Everybody gave me
   10 cents.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.471
   Waitress!

16:44.504 --> 16:46.906
 - What is it?
 - Would you
 bring me a hamburger?

16:46.940 --> 16:48.742
   I already brought you 10.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.544
   I want to give you business.
   I like you.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.314
  Thank you.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.683
 Waitress!
 Where's my Ovaltine?

16:58.785 --> 17:00.787
Miss, this isn't
what I ordered.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.622
   You were supposed
   to toast my buns.

17:02.655 --> 17:06.226
You want toasted buns?
Go sit on a microwave!

17:06.925 --> 17:08.795
That's it! I've had it!

17:10.363 --> 17:11.698
 Hey, hey,
 what's wrong?

17:11.731 --> 17:14.300
I'll never make
any money at this rate.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.635
Well then, you've got
to move faster.

17:15.669 --> 17:18.672
 Look,
 the more people you wait on,
 the more tips you get, right?

17:18.704 --> 17:22.409
   Come on Lisa. I'll show you.
   I used to be
   a busboy in Bolivia.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.881
  Hey, I'm not done.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.716
 Yes you are.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.351
   Right, I forgot.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.757
   Hey, what are you doing?

17:37.791 --> 17:41.327
 - Hey, it's fast food.
 - Here's your check.

17:41.361 --> 17:42.562
Hey, come on you guys.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.432
   Come on, move it.

18:02.882 --> 18:07.487
   $37 in tips in three hours?
   Whoo! I can't believe it!

18:07.520 --> 18:10.724
 Lisa, that's great.
 You only need about 230 more.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.827
  We're a great team. You know,
  we might make it after all.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.730
   Yeah, maybe.
   I mean if I keep working,

18:16.763 --> 18:18.832
  and Zack sells
  more of my clothes.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.935
 Uh... Lisa?
 Can we talk?

18:22.635 --> 18:23.837
  Over there?

18:23.870 --> 18:25.338
  Yeah, sure.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.045
 Lisa, all your clothes
 are gone.

18:32.045 --> 18:34.681
 - Gone? That's great!
 - Not really.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.350
Belding thought
you brought them in
for the charity drive.

18:37.384 --> 18:40.053
 He was so touched
 by your donation,
 I couldn't tell him the truth.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.057
  ( giddy laughter )

18:49.529 --> 18:50.897
   I'm a fool, Zack.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.899
No, I am.
Look, I'm sorry, Lisa.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.602
   I'll tell
   Belding it was my fault
   and get your stuff back.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.338
   No, Zack. I want to make
   that donation.

18:58.371 --> 19:01.641
  It's about time
  I start thinking
  of someone besides myself.

19:01.675 --> 19:03.677
 And I'm going to tell
 my father the truth.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.046
 Now Lisa,
 don't panic.

19:06.079 --> 19:10.016
   Zack, if my father finds out
   what I've done
   before I tell him,

19:10.016 --> 19:12.552
 he's going to be
 really hurt.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.587
   Then maybe you'd better
   tell your father.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.590
   I see this is
   hurting you, too.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.459
 I want to thank you
 for all you've done.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.395
   I'm really grateful
   for everything
   you tried to do.

19:22.429 --> 19:25.398
But I've got to stand
on my own two feet now.

19:25.432 --> 19:27.801
  And it's not going to be easy
  with all my shoes gone.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.038
 ( knocking )

19:32.706 --> 19:34.040
   Come in.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.744
  You wanted to talk to me,
  Princess?

19:37.777 --> 19:40.480
I'm not a princess,
I'm not a nice person,

19:40.513 --> 19:42.615
I'm pond scum!

19:42.649 --> 19:44.751
What are you
talking about?

19:44.784 --> 19:47.053
 Remember when you gave me your
 credit card to
 buy something nice?

19:47.053 --> 19:49.622
   I bought 10
   nice somethings.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.792
  Are you saying you charged
  too much on my credit card?

19:52.826 --> 19:55.095
$386 too much.

19:55.128 --> 19:56.896
   I'd say that's too much.
   Yes.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.533
   I'm sorry, Daddy.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.469
  We all make mistakes,
  sweetheart.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.404
I'm sure you've learned
your lesson.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.741
Now, let's go
to The Sizzler.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.977
 ''The Sizzler''?
 After all I've been through?

20:22.022 --> 20:25.091
   Daddy, I was
   kissed by nerds!

20:25.125 --> 20:27.060
And I sold
all my clothes!

20:27.093 --> 20:30.096
And I got a job,
as a waitress!

20:30.130 --> 20:33.933
   My daughter
   waited on tables?

20:33.967 --> 20:37.771
 Yeah, here's $153.
 That's what I've made so far.

20:39.873 --> 20:43.576
  It sounds like
  you've been through a lot.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.179
   Daddy, punish me.
   Get it over with.

20:46.212 --> 20:49.616
  I just want to be treated
  like any normal,
  beautiful girl.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.053
I've got a better idea.

20:53.086 --> 20:56.990
  You're going to keep that job
  until you pay me
  back every cent.

20:57.023 --> 21:00.260
  - ( knocking )
  - Come in.

21:00.293 --> 21:03.596
  Excuse me, Dr. Turtle.
  We came by to
  give this to Lisa.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.633
   - What is it?
   - $83. We all chipped in.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.735
 Screech even sold his body
 to science.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.604
 Yeah, they gave him
 $20 to take it back.

21:13.139 --> 21:16.943
  You have some loyal friends.
  You are a very lucky girl.

21:16.976 --> 21:20.146
Thanks,
you guys, you're great.
But I can't take this.

21:20.180 --> 21:21.848
   I've got to earn back
   the money myself,

21:21.881 --> 21:23.783
 or he'll ship me
 to a foreign country.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.753
  It'll never happen.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.822
   No foreign country
   could afford her.

21:34.194 --> 21:37.697
  The moral of the story, gang?
  Well, it's simple:

21:37.731 --> 21:41.101
   "The Lisa Card..."
   Don't leave home with it.

21:47.707 --> 21:50.176
  ( instrumental
  theme music plays )
