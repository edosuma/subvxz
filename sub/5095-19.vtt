00:07.740 --> 00:11.273
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
Check it out, check it out.

00:13.442 --> 00:15.607
You really gonna do it?

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:30.151 --> 00:31.716
No way.

00:48.553 --> 00:49.633
All right, come on,
come on.

00:49.921 --> 00:50.950
All right, let's go,

00:50.952 --> 00:51.950
let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:51.952 --> 00:55.723
(screaming)

01:03.035 --> 01:05.305
NICKY: <i> What's the worst part</i>
<i>of your job?</i>

01:05.307 --> 01:07.105
Worst part of my job
is when someone

01:07.107 --> 01:08.641
gets away with breaking a law.

01:08.643 --> 01:10.473
Why? Does it make you
feel guilty?

01:10.475 --> 01:11.873
Yes.

01:11.875 --> 01:13.880
Does it make you wish
you weren't a lawyer?

01:13.882 --> 01:16.543
It makes me want to be
a better lawyer.

01:16.545 --> 01:19.717
Now let's go before we're late.

01:22.950 --> 01:25.451
Hey.
Reagan.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.654
I have a surprise
for you.

01:27.656 --> 01:29.094
Robbery or homicide?

01:29.096 --> 01:30.526
It's worse than that.

01:30.528 --> 01:33.492
You ever hear of the NYPD's
Rescue Ride program?

01:33.494 --> 01:35.626
It pairs young
criminal offenders

01:35.628 --> 01:36.961
with positive
role models.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.632
Yeah. So?

01:38.634 --> 01:40.262
I think you're
a perfect candidate.

01:40.264 --> 01:41.494
To be the offender

01:41.496 --> 01:42.964
or the role model?

01:45.199 --> 01:48.637
Charelle Tyler was arrested
for drug possession

01:48.639 --> 01:50.637
and harassment.

01:50.639 --> 01:53.772
She just turned 16,
so technically an adult.

01:53.774 --> 01:57.044
The judge agreed to
let her do Rescue Ride

01:57.046 --> 01:59.908
I think she'd be better off
riding with Fernandez.

01:59.910 --> 02:01.547
Yeah, she-she...
He's great with kids.

02:01.549 --> 02:03.011
He loves kids.

02:03.013 --> 02:04.882
She's gonna ride
with the both of you.

02:04.884 --> 02:07.753
And you're going to show
her that cops are not--

02:07.755 --> 02:10.656
this is a direct quote--

02:10.657 --> 02:13.351
“a bunch of lowlife pigs.”

02:13.353 --> 02:15.422
I'm not the right
person for this.

02:15.424 --> 02:17.421
Possibly not...

02:17.423 --> 02:19.060
Definitely not.

02:19.062 --> 02:21.029
...but you're gonna.

02:21.031 --> 02:23.965
Good luck.

02:25.303 --> 02:27.636
(sighs)

02:27.638 --> 02:29.404
(elevator bell dings)

02:29.406 --> 02:30.836
Where are we with the victim?

02:30.838 --> 02:32.603
Identified as
Benjamin Wilson.

02:32.605 --> 02:34.003
He's been homeless
for four years,

02:34.005 --> 02:35.706
has a history of
mental problems.

02:35.708 --> 02:37.105
Sister in Ozone Park.

02:37.107 --> 02:38.505
We got detectives
canvassing,

02:38.507 --> 02:40.512
nothing substantial
to report yet.

02:40.514 --> 02:41.775
Who called it in?

02:41.777 --> 02:44.414
No one. Patrolman found
the man after the fact.

02:44.416 --> 02:46.478
What about the crime scene?
They got a sneaker print

02:46.480 --> 02:47.910
near where
the victim was torched,

02:47.912 --> 02:50.249
so if we get any suspects,
we'll look for a match.

02:50.251 --> 02:51.657
Not if. When.

02:51.659 --> 02:53.457
Baker, I'll be eating in.

02:53.459 --> 02:55.563
I'll cancel your lunch.
Thank you.

02:55.565 --> 02:57.427
Anne Farrell on
Channel 2 has a mouthful

02:57.429 --> 02:59.268
to say about
it and you.

02:59.270 --> 03:00.300
Tell me something new.

03:00.302 --> 03:02.565
A homeless man was
executed last night

03:02.567 --> 03:04.901
in front of 15 stories
of apartment buildings

03:04.903 --> 03:08.045
that overlook this area
of the Brownsville section

03:08.047 --> 03:09.045
of Brooklyn.

03:09.047 --> 03:11.182
And not one call
was made to 911,

03:11.184 --> 03:13.246
because,
as one neighbor put it...

03:13.248 --> 03:16.485
Around here,
we're more scared of the cops

03:16.487 --> 03:18.620
than we are of the criminals.

03:18.622 --> 03:20.587
And that's not right.

03:20.589 --> 03:23.051
FARRELL: And what would you like
to say to NYPD commissioner

03:23.053 --> 03:24.290
Frank Reagan?

03:24.292 --> 03:26.120
Where's the cameras
in this neighborhood, huh?

03:26.122 --> 03:29.486
Where's the police in this
neighborhood when we need them?

03:30.360 --> 03:32.893
20 bucks says she coaches them.

03:32.895 --> 03:35.354
Her harangues on this department
are getting more frequent.

03:35.356 --> 03:37.856
And she's trending on Twitter,
like, all the time.

03:37.858 --> 03:39.623
My wife tracks these things.

03:39.625 --> 03:42.598
I want vertical patrols
in all buildings

03:42.600 --> 03:43.693
overlooking the park.

03:43.695 --> 03:45.332
Knock on doors,
talk to shopkeepers

03:45.334 --> 03:47.531
and parents and kids.

03:47.533 --> 03:49.530
I want this case closed.

03:49.532 --> 03:52.265
And I want to meet
with this reporter.

03:52.267 --> 03:54.938
I don't think
that's a good idea.

03:54.940 --> 03:57.108
Neither do I. Set it up.

04:03.878 --> 04:05.242
(door opens)

04:05.244 --> 04:07.209
Sit up straight.

04:08.779 --> 04:10.176
Stop playing with
that necklace.

04:10.178 --> 04:12.448
This is
Detective Reagan

04:12.450 --> 04:14.175
and Detective Baez.

04:14.177 --> 04:15.679
You don't cooperate

04:15.681 --> 04:18.118
with them, I'm personally
calling the judge

04:18.120 --> 04:21.213
and getting you sent
to Rikers. Got it?

04:21.214 --> 04:22.989
Got it.

04:26.989 --> 04:29.355
Just so you know,
we have no interest

04:29.357 --> 04:31.458
in being your babysitters.
Yeah?

04:31.460 --> 04:34.995
Just so you know, I got
no interest in you. Or you.

04:34.997 --> 04:36.667
Or what y'all
do or why.

04:36.669 --> 04:38.196
I'm here 'cause they're
making me.

04:38.198 --> 04:40.573
So don't expect me to pretend
I'm interested in

04:40.575 --> 04:44.542
your low-paying, civil servant,
bullcrap job, a'ight?

04:44.544 --> 04:45.710
A'ight.

04:45.712 --> 04:47.613
Nice meeting you, too.

04:47.615 --> 04:49.013
You sit tight

04:49.015 --> 04:51.213
for a while.

04:57.887 --> 04:59.586
Heard you were looking for me.

04:59.588 --> 05:01.320
Yeah. This morning,

05:01.322 --> 05:03.383
as part of a school project,
my daughter asked me

05:03.385 --> 05:05.158
what the worst part
of my job was.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.989
And I told her not finding
justice for a victim.

05:07.991 --> 05:09.460
As far as I can see,

05:09.462 --> 05:11.627
you got a pretty good
track record on that.

05:11.629 --> 05:14.762
I've got a 20-year-old homicide
I want off the books.

05:14.764 --> 05:16.561
Okay.

05:16.563 --> 05:19.960
41-year-old woman, single,
living in East New York,

05:19.962 --> 05:23.801
found on the corner of
Nostrand and Avenue O.

05:23.803 --> 05:26.001
Stabbed twice with a knife.

05:26.003 --> 05:27.407
Single mother of a six...

05:27.409 --> 05:29.104
16-year-old son.

05:29.106 --> 05:31.209
Who grew up to become a cop.

05:32.611 --> 05:34.578
Why do you want to look
into my mother's murder?

05:34.580 --> 05:37.788
You told me you became a cop
to solve your mother's murder.

05:37.790 --> 05:40.527
I also told you
I tried and failed.

05:40.529 --> 05:42.592
I took a look at
the detective's case file.

05:42.594 --> 05:46.294
Your mother was working at the
24th Street Diner that night?

05:46.296 --> 05:47.534
Yeah.

05:47.536 --> 05:48.933
Were there any suspects?

05:48.935 --> 05:50.365
It looked like
a robbery gone bad.

05:50.367 --> 05:53.004
Her jewelry was taken,
a ring she wore every day--

05:53.006 --> 05:56.138
a gold band with angel wings
engraved in it

05:56.140 --> 05:57.634
that her mother gave to her.

05:57.636 --> 05:59.705
And there were never any leads?
No leads.

05:59.707 --> 06:02.840
No suspects. No arrests.
No evidence of any value.

06:02.842 --> 06:05.174
Erin, why are you doing this?

06:05.176 --> 06:06.342
What's that supposed to mean?

06:06.344 --> 06:07.879
I mean, don't you think
I've tried?

06:07.881 --> 06:11.648
I'm not suggesting you can't
solve this on your own.

06:11.650 --> 06:14.183
That's exactly
what this is suggesting.

06:15.153 --> 06:19.821
I've been over this case...
a million times.

06:19.823 --> 06:21.052
Exactly my point.

06:21.054 --> 06:23.187
I thought maybe I could
bring some fresh eyes to it.

06:23.189 --> 06:27.661
Or maybe it'll just
open up old wounds.

has seen my reports?

Oh, yeah, we've seen
all your segments

07:03.048 --> 07:03.823

Anne Farrell,

07:10.417 --> 07:12.055
Pleasure, Commissioner.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.958
Is it?

07:14.960 --> 07:17.654
Well, why don't
we have a seat.

07:17.656 --> 07:20.586
Please.

07:20.588 --> 07:23.688
I appreciate you inviting me up.

07:23.690 --> 07:25.855
And I appreciate you showing up.

Coffee?

I'm good, thanks.

07:28.830 --> 07:30.859
We have tea.
No, thank you.

07:30.861 --> 07:32.530
Humble pie?

07:34.667 --> 07:36.960
We got plenty of that
around here.

07:36.962 --> 07:41.134
35,000 cops trying to police
around ten million people--

07:41.136 --> 07:44.038
you're guaranteed
a fair amount of failures.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.037
What the commissioner means...

07:45.039 --> 07:46.669
FRANK: What the
commissioner means

07:46.671 --> 07:49.573
is we are
terminally shorthanded.

07:49.575 --> 07:51.605
It does not mean
that we are short

07:51.607 --> 07:54.076
on ambition or achievements.

07:54.078 --> 07:55.677
Quite the opposite.

07:55.679 --> 07:58.882
Nobody is saying the NYPD
isn't doing a good job,

07:58.884 --> 08:00.480
in some respects.

08:00.482 --> 08:03.783
Yes. In respect to Park Avenue.

08:03.785 --> 08:05.814
In respect to our Park Slope.

08:05.816 --> 08:08.917
But not in respect
to Brownsville.

08:08.919 --> 08:10.516
I didn't say that.

08:10.518 --> 08:13.955
It's between the lines
in every line you broadcast.

08:13.957 --> 08:15.985
Are you seriously
gonna deny

08:15.987 --> 08:18.321
that police relations
with the Brownsville community

08:18.323 --> 08:19.890
can't use improvement?

08:19.892 --> 08:21.528
Of course they can.

08:21.530 --> 08:24.593
But that is not
what you reported.

08:24.595 --> 08:29.062
You called the NYPD
apathetic and racist.

08:30.534 --> 08:33.496
I didn't use that terminology.

08:33.499 --> 08:36.265
Let's not split hairs.

08:36.267 --> 08:40.571
A man was murdered in open view,
and no one called 911,

08:40.573 --> 08:43.010
and there was not one measure
in place to prevent it.

08:43.013 --> 08:46.714
We have more patrol units there
and the same amount

08:46.716 --> 08:50.482
of surveillance equipment
as we do on Sutton Place.

08:50.484 --> 08:53.417
The difference is the
citizens in Brownsville

08:53.419 --> 08:57.486
choose to disable that equipment
with spray paint and potshots.

08:57.488 --> 08:58.717
And is it replaced?

08:58.719 --> 08:59.916
Right away.

08:59.918 --> 09:02.553
Only to be disabled again.

09:02.555 --> 09:04.088
I can show you the logs.

09:04.090 --> 09:05.822
The reason the person
who committed this crime

09:05.824 --> 09:07.286
has gotten away with it
is because

09:07.288 --> 09:10.389
the community doesn't trust you,
and your department.

09:10.391 --> 09:12.660
Well, maybe you could help.

09:12.662 --> 09:14.692
Why don't you take
a vertical patrol

09:14.694 --> 09:16.596
of this building.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.828
Talk to the men and women here
the way you do the men and women

09:19.830 --> 09:22.132
you interview
on the street.

09:22.134 --> 09:23.572
Another time, perhaps.

09:23.574 --> 09:25.604
You sure?
Garrett could show you around.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.308
I'd be glad to.

09:28.142 --> 09:30.939
My issue is with the leadership.

09:30.941 --> 09:33.715
So you isolate me
from the herd--

09:33.717 --> 09:35.883
easier to take me down.

09:37.653 --> 09:40.218
That's a hell of a way
of putting it.

09:40.220 --> 09:42.985
Well, I'm not the wordsmith.

09:44.819 --> 09:46.321
I'm gonna do you a favor.

09:46.323 --> 09:49.624
I'm gonna make this
conversation off the record.

09:49.626 --> 09:51.823
I'll show myself out.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.697
You take a right
at the burning cross

09:55.699 --> 09:59.307
and a left
at the Confederate flag.

10:00.174 --> 10:02.741
Have a good day.

10:05.815 --> 10:07.548
(door closes)

10:07.550 --> 10:10.346
That went well.

10:17.089 --> 10:19.753
You went to PS 98?
I grew up right around there.

10:19.755 --> 10:20.993
Uh-huh.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.794
Have you decided what you want
to do after high school?

10:23.796 --> 10:26.963
Well, I was hoping to get
pregnant and get on welfare.

10:26.965 --> 10:29.571
That doesn't work out,
I might look into writing.

10:29.573 --> 10:31.338
You keep getting arrested,
you'll have all the time

10:31.340 --> 10:33.073
you want to do all
the writing you want

10:33.075 --> 10:35.165
while you're locked
up in prison.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.133
(phone ringing)

10:37.135 --> 10:38.637
Reagan.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.307
You know,
this'll go a lot easier

10:40.309 --> 10:42.476
if you stop acting
like we're the enemy here.

10:42.478 --> 10:43.676
DANNY:
On our way.

10:43.678 --> 10:45.107
Homicide at 450 East 101.
(siren wailing)

10:45.109 --> 10:47.343
Finally, I get to do
something more exciting

10:47.345 --> 10:48.510
than listen to you two.

10:48.512 --> 10:50.806
Just sit there and shut
your mouth, young lady.

10:50.808 --> 10:54.380
(siren wailing)

11:02.589 --> 11:05.049
Hey, hold on.
You wait here, okay?

11:05.051 --> 11:07.919
Keep an eye on her
till we get back.

11:11.423 --> 11:13.693
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

11:15.831 --> 11:18.765
Door's splintered.
It's definitely forced entry.

11:18.767 --> 11:21.734
We got two entrance wounds,
close range.

11:22.936 --> 11:25.503
DANNY: Somebody was looking
for something.

11:31.717 --> 11:35.220
I may have an idea
of what it was

11:35.222 --> 11:37.893
they were looking for.

11:39.591 --> 11:41.261
A magnet?
Not a magnet

11:41.263 --> 11:42.629
per Se, but...

11:42.631 --> 11:45.735
what you would use...

11:45.737 --> 11:47.472
this magnet for.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.169
To open a trapdoor.

11:49.171 --> 11:51.105
(hollow thumping)

11:51.107 --> 11:52.873
Hear that?

11:57.114 --> 11:59.048
(sighs) What do you know.

12:06.925 --> 12:08.502
Now we know what they
were looking for.

12:08.526 --> 12:09.990
Oh, yeah.

12:12.997 --> 12:14.003
(retching)

12:14.005 --> 12:16.404
What the hell
is she doing in here?

12:17.174 --> 12:18.340
Hey!

12:23.446 --> 12:25.180
Hey!

12:25.182 --> 12:27.246
I told you
to watch her.

12:27.248 --> 12:28.485
She slipped past me.

12:28.487 --> 12:30.054
Where the
hell'd she go?

12:30.056 --> 12:31.822
She's right here.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.990
(coughing)

12:37.927 --> 12:39.556
At least now you know

12:39.558 --> 12:41.164
why I told you to wait.

12:42.567 --> 12:44.230
It's all right.

12:44.232 --> 12:46.302
My first D.O.A.
was a decapitation.

12:46.304 --> 12:48.470
I threw up and contaminated
the crime scene.

12:48.472 --> 12:50.038
That's not
what this is.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.470
So what is it?

12:51.472 --> 12:53.342
I wasn't feeling
well, is all.

12:53.344 --> 12:55.542
Really? Okay.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.783
You know, I think
it's good you saw that.

12:59.785 --> 13:00.847
'Cause if you keep it up,

13:00.849 --> 13:02.824
you're probably gonna
end up like her.

13:02.826 --> 13:04.322
You know what I think?

13:04.324 --> 13:05.690
What do you think?

13:05.692 --> 13:09.264
I think you should stay
the hell out of my business.

13:12.331 --> 13:14.737
(sighs)

13:17.771 --> 13:19.601
Witness statement
for the Valdez case.

13:19.603 --> 13:21.073
Thanks.

13:21.075 --> 13:24.873
Erin, this morning, talking
about my mother's murder just...

13:24.875 --> 13:26.145
Opened everything up.

13:26.147 --> 13:27.881
I don't know what
I was thinking.

13:27.883 --> 13:30.081
You were thinking with your
heart, which you always do.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.649
At your expense.

13:31.651 --> 13:33.153
I have no problem
dropping it.

13:33.155 --> 13:34.416
Yeah, you do.

13:34.418 --> 13:35.816
You don't drop anything.

13:35.818 --> 13:38.719
So what do you
want to know?

13:38.721 --> 13:39.823
(sighs)

13:39.825 --> 13:43.022
There was a witness
who said the assailant

13:43.024 --> 13:45.062
called your
mother by name.

13:45.064 --> 13:47.262
Mandy Schilling.
I tracked her down in '95.

13:47.264 --> 13:49.197
She recanted,
said she didn't remember.

13:49.199 --> 13:50.934
(sighs) Was anyone angry
with your mother?

13:50.936 --> 13:52.837
Was she fighting with anyone
at the time?

13:52.839 --> 13:55.740
No. She was always
helping people.

13:55.742 --> 13:58.109
Even though it seemed
like we were struggling

13:58.111 --> 13:59.743
all the time ourselves.

13:59.745 --> 14:01.016
What about your dad?

14:01.018 --> 14:03.047
No, my father left
when I was two.

14:03.049 --> 14:04.350
I barely knew him.

14:04.352 --> 14:06.247
Did your mom have
any boyfriends?

14:06.249 --> 14:08.520
None that I was aware of--
she never brought men home.

14:08.522 --> 14:10.321
The weapon was recovered.

14:10.323 --> 14:11.393
Didn't yield anything.

14:11.395 --> 14:13.025
I even had it retested.

14:13.027 --> 14:14.426
In '98.

14:14.428 --> 14:16.834
That was before Low Copy DNA.

14:16.836 --> 14:19.401
I think we should try it again.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.463
Okay.

14:26.071 --> 14:27.237
Am I missing anything?

14:27.239 --> 14:29.636
Not that I can think of.

14:29.638 --> 14:31.508
You sure you want
to take this on?

14:31.510 --> 14:33.539
You're juggling
a lot of cases right now.

14:33.541 --> 14:37.012
None more important than this.

14:43.317 --> 14:46.052
We got an I.D. on the Vic:
Amel Wilkinson, no priors.

14:46.054 --> 14:47.957
You run his address
through Nitro yet?

14:47.959 --> 14:49.924
Yeah, the apartment belongs
to Melvin Williams.

14:49.926 --> 14:51.595
He was arrested
on drug possession

14:51.597 --> 14:53.330
with intent to sell
two days ago.

14:53.332 --> 14:55.195
Where is he now,
this Melvin Williams?

14:55.197 --> 14:56.331
Awaiting arraignment.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.162
Great. Let's
bring him in.

14:58.164 --> 15:01.634
Reagan, let me see you.

15:01.636 --> 15:04.403
What is it now, boss?

15:04.405 --> 15:06.244
Charelle Tyler.

15:06.246 --> 15:07.909
Is a pain in my ass.

15:07.911 --> 15:09.813
So you found something
in common.

15:09.815 --> 15:10.815
Joke all you want, okay?

15:10.816 --> 15:12.518
But this whole thing
is a waste of time.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.549
She's too young to be
hanging around with cops,

15:14.551 --> 15:16.349
and she's too young
to understand.

15:16.351 --> 15:19.291
To understand what it's like to
face real consequences of crime?

15:19.293 --> 15:20.587
Mm-hmm.

15:20.589 --> 15:23.457
She has a record,
and she's only 16.

15:23.459 --> 15:26.023
Exactly. And I don't understand
how riding around with cops

15:26.025 --> 15:28.694
and hanging in the squad room
is gonna do anything

15:28.696 --> 15:30.126
to turn her life around.

15:30.928 --> 15:33.830
It... worked for me.

15:33.832 --> 15:37.902
Oh, right, because you were once
Charelle Tyler yourself, right?

15:39.704 --> 15:41.932
My mother died when I was 12.

15:41.934 --> 15:44.906
I started hanging
with a bad crowd

15:44.908 --> 15:46.570
from school.

15:46.572 --> 15:49.177
I got arrested
when a friend of mine

15:49.179 --> 15:52.178
stole cigarettes,
and, uh...

15:52.180 --> 15:55.314
I was sent through Rescue Ride.

15:57.052 --> 16:00.289
It's what made me
want to become a cop.

16:00.291 --> 16:03.383
All right.
Look, I get it, okay?

16:03.385 --> 16:07.159
There are some people who...
need someone to catch them.

16:07.161 --> 16:11.263
There are also some people who
need someone to let them fall.

16:12.065 --> 16:14.735
DANNY:
Do you know her?

16:14.737 --> 16:16.399
That's my cousin Wilkie.

16:16.401 --> 16:18.702
Cousin Wilkie was executed
in your apartment.

16:19.568 --> 16:21.438
Is my girl okay?

16:21.440 --> 16:23.142
Who's your girl?
Angel Ramirez.

16:23.144 --> 16:24.973
She was staying there, too.

16:24.975 --> 16:26.341
To protect your drugs?

16:26.343 --> 16:27.709
What drugs?

16:27.711 --> 16:28.973
Come on.
Cousin's dead;

16:28.975 --> 16:30.709
for all we know,
your girl is dead;

16:30.711 --> 16:32.013
we found traps in
your apartment--

16:32.015 --> 16:34.012
you're really gonna sit here
and play stupid with us?

16:34.014 --> 16:36.852
(sighs)
I asked them to watch my place

16:36.854 --> 16:39.356
because I thought otherwise it'd
get hit once I got arrested.

16:39.358 --> 16:40.523
By who?

16:40.525 --> 16:42.354
I'm not cooperating.
Really?

16:42.356 --> 16:44.922
Even though your girl may
end up just like your cousin?

16:44.924 --> 16:46.457
I talk to you guys,
she's in more trouble.

16:46.459 --> 16:48.057
What if we protect her?
You protect her?

16:48.059 --> 16:49.793
Yeah.

16:49.795 --> 16:52.833
Who's gonna protect her
from you guys, huh?

16:54.203 --> 16:56.296
Because that's who's doing this.

16:56.298 --> 16:57.535
What?

16:57.537 --> 16:59.303
Cops.

16:59.305 --> 17:01.038
Cops?

17:01.839 --> 17:03.867
(sighs)

17:14.049 --> 17:16.184
Does she have a
point, Garrett?

17:16.185 --> 17:18.248
Send me the link. Frank.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.784
Does she have a point?

17:22.890 --> 17:26.928
Brooklyn North is
the murder capital of New York.

17:26.930 --> 17:30.328
As of May 21, more people
were shot in that community

17:30.330 --> 17:32.129
than in all of Manhattan.

17:32.131 --> 17:33.665
Is that a yes?

17:33.667 --> 17:36.506
It's a fact. And that's
what reporters rely on.

17:38.476 --> 17:42.919
A wise man once told me
that policing is about

17:42.921 --> 17:45.456
positively affecting
one person at a time

17:45.458 --> 17:46.953
for the better.

17:46.955 --> 17:50.225
That wise man
was naive back then.

17:50.227 --> 17:52.257
Whenever I doubted
my ability to do something,

17:52.259 --> 17:56.096
my mother used to tell me
that I should take stupid pills.

17:56.098 --> 17:59.063
She told me that anything
great she did in life

17:59.065 --> 18:03.470
was because she was too stupid
to realize it wasn't possible.

18:05.303 --> 18:07.172
I hate this part of the job.

18:07.174 --> 18:08.308
Dealing with the media?

18:08.310 --> 18:11.307
No, they could fight back.

18:11.309 --> 18:13.505
I hate acts without motive.

18:13.507 --> 18:17.110
Without any logic
other than pure evil.

18:22.214 --> 18:27.453
This is about changing a culture
that's taken hold

18:27.455 --> 18:30.487
that believes we're the enemy.

18:30.489 --> 18:33.096
How do I do that?

18:34.930 --> 18:36.361
Frank.

18:36.363 --> 18:37.698
What?

18:37.700 --> 18:40.905
Anne Farrell just posted
an interview with the killer.

18:43.874 --> 18:46.608
When I ran other known
drug address in the area,

18:46.610 --> 18:48.945
it turns out they've been hit
with burglaries, too.

18:48.947 --> 18:50.408
So we got a pattern.

18:50.410 --> 18:53.080
Dealers get arrested,
and within 24 hours

18:53.082 --> 18:54.481
their stash houses get hit.

18:54.483 --> 18:56.616
So we got perps
dressed up like cops?

18:56.618 --> 18:58.015
Or dirty cops.

18:58.017 --> 18:59.255
(sighs)

18:59.257 --> 19:01.390
Either way, we better
notify Internal Affairs.

19:01.392 --> 19:03.390
Though I don't have
much sympathy

19:03.392 --> 19:06.123
for drug dealers getting robbed
of their stash and cash.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.627
I have a friend
in the Narcotics Division.

19:07.629 --> 19:09.827
I'm gonna go meet him
for a quick cup of coffee

19:09.829 --> 19:11.162
and see what I can suss up.

19:11.164 --> 19:13.259
Great. You want
I should come with?

19:13.261 --> 19:14.996
Um, no, I'll be back

19:14.998 --> 19:16.365
in a half hour.

19:16.367 --> 19:18.173
You sure this is
just a friend?

19:18.175 --> 19:21.140
Okay, he's more than a friend.

19:21.142 --> 19:22.939
Oh, my goodness.

19:22.941 --> 19:24.842
Well, have fun with that.
I'll just, uh,

19:24.844 --> 19:28.778
look for surveillance videos
on the places that got hit.

19:30.883 --> 19:32.314
Don't be

19:32.316 --> 19:35.051
assuming it's a cop just
'cause of the description, okay?

19:35.053 --> 19:36.019
Why not?

19:36.021 --> 19:37.986
Don't cops always
make assumptions?

19:37.988 --> 19:39.490
Even you.
No, they don't.

19:39.492 --> 19:41.793
And what does that mean,
even me?

19:41.795 --> 19:43.889
You assume I'm tempted to get
into selling or doing drugs

19:43.891 --> 19:45.192
just because of where I'm from.

19:45.194 --> 19:47.262
Well, there's also
your arrest record.

19:47.264 --> 19:49.389
I know more about drugs
than you ever will,

19:49.391 --> 19:50.356
so stop insulting me.

19:50.358 --> 19:51.923
Yeah, okay.
You have a record.

19:51.925 --> 19:54.097
Someone thinks you're at risk,
which is why you're here,

19:54.099 --> 19:56.265
so would you please stop
busting my chops, young lady?

19:56.267 --> 19:58.233
Yeah, I got a record
for harassment,

19:58.235 --> 20:00.768
'cause I got into it with a guy
who was hassling my brother.

20:00.770 --> 20:02.767
And because...

20:02.769 --> 20:04.905
And I got an arrest
for possession 'cause I had

20:04.907 --> 20:07.506
a small amount of weed
in my pocket when I got tossed.

20:07.508 --> 20:08.673
Oh, right.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.345
You're too young
to have weed in your pocket.

20:11.347 --> 20:13.416
But you, without knowing
anything about me,

20:13.418 --> 20:15.678
you assume I'm gonna end up
like that dead girl.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.046
So don't talk to me about
making assumptions about cops.

20:18.048 --> 20:20.780
How about I just
don't talk to you at all?

20:23.549 --> 20:25.450
MAN (voice distorted):
<i>I ain't even gonna lie to you.</i>

20:25.452 --> 20:26.954
I'm a gangbanger.

20:26.956 --> 20:29.185
But why kill someone
you don't even know?

20:29.187 --> 20:30.953
To earn my
first stripe.

20:30.955 --> 20:33.256
FARRELL: Even when you know
that by doing so

20:33.258 --> 20:35.358
you could get
life in prison if caught?

20:35.360 --> 20:37.029
Gangs own my
neighborhood,

20:37.031 --> 20:38.261
so either you gonna be in one,

20:38.263 --> 20:39.924
or you gonna become
a victim of one.

20:44.392 --> 20:47.026
I have nothing to share
with you, Commissioner.

20:47.028 --> 20:50.527
How about the name
of Benjamin Wilson's killer?

20:50.529 --> 20:52.695
My agreement with him
was not to release his identity.

20:52.697 --> 20:55.326
You're gonna withhold
information on a homicide?

20:55.328 --> 20:56.997
Which is my right as a reporter.

20:56.999 --> 20:58.965
What about your obligation
as a citizen?

20:58.967 --> 21:00.269
We're talking
about my job here.

21:00.271 --> 21:02.605
I'm sworn to protect my source.

21:02.607 --> 21:04.101
You're glorifying the killer.

21:04.103 --> 21:06.205
That's not my intent.
What, then?

21:06.207 --> 21:09.139
To inform people,
and hopefully effect change.

21:09.141 --> 21:10.338
What kind of change

21:10.340 --> 21:13.744
are you effecting when
you allow a thug to go on TV

21:13.746 --> 21:16.878
and justify taking
an innocent person's life?

21:16.880 --> 21:19.445
Well, maybe if we understand
why it happened,

21:19.447 --> 21:22.117
we can prevent it
from happening again.

21:22.119 --> 21:24.117
We? You walking a beat now?

21:24.119 --> 21:28.019
There's more to effecting change
than policing and you know that.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.218
There's no excuse for this.

21:29.220 --> 21:30.418
I don't need
an excuse.

21:30.420 --> 21:33.952
I am protected
under the First Amendment.

21:33.954 --> 21:36.157
You're talking crap.

21:38.526 --> 21:41.658
And I think you know it.

21:41.660 --> 21:43.856
(door closes)

21:48.098 --> 21:49.993
BAEZ: They wore
raid jackets and shields.

21:49.995 --> 21:52.369
But they're bogus?

21:52.371 --> 21:54.539
We were able to zero in on a
guy with a tattoo on his hand.

21:54.541 --> 21:57.605
MSK.
Money Street Kings.

21:57.607 --> 22:00.814
They run the heroin and cocaine
supply above 95th Street.

22:00.816 --> 22:02.983
Is there a plan?

22:02.985 --> 22:04.687
Manhattan North Narcotics
has a C.I. that's gonna

22:04.689 --> 22:07.085
get word to MSK that
there's a large amount

22:07.087 --> 22:09.486
of drugs at a location
in Washington Heights

22:09.488 --> 22:12.023
with very little security
guarding it.

22:12.025 --> 22:13.593
ESU will be assisting.

22:13.595 --> 22:15.193
We'll take them down.

22:15.195 --> 22:17.265
Well, keep me
up to speed.

22:17.267 --> 22:19.769
Oh, and,
just so you know,

22:19.771 --> 22:22.239
Charelle's last day is Monday.

22:22.241 --> 22:24.774
Great. So we can get
back to saving people

22:24.776 --> 22:26.837
who actually
want to be saved.

22:34.378 --> 22:35.872
Hey.

22:35.874 --> 22:37.680
Didn't this used to be the...?

22:37.682 --> 22:38.808
Supply room. Yeah.

22:38.810 --> 22:40.016
Wow.

22:40.018 --> 22:41.849
Living the dream.
Looks good.

22:41.851 --> 22:43.321
Do you play?

22:43.323 --> 22:44.321
Uh, yeah.

22:44.323 --> 22:46.617
Pickup game here and there
after work.

22:46.619 --> 22:48.487
You should invite me sometime.

22:50.025 --> 22:51.221
Don't give me that

22:51.223 --> 22:53.092
“you probably play
like a girl” look,

22:53.094 --> 22:55.861
because I play like a girl
who grew up with three brothers.

22:55.863 --> 22:57.429
Okay, you're on.

22:57.431 --> 22:59.429
Yeah, okay.
Okay.

22:59.431 --> 23:02.067
But I know you're not here
to talk about basketball.

23:03.901 --> 23:05.202
Yeah.

23:05.204 --> 23:06.369
(clears throat)

23:08.435 --> 23:11.000
M.E.'s office
was able to get a DNA profile

23:11.002 --> 23:13.301
on the knife used
in your mother's murder.

23:13.303 --> 23:15.972
It was remarkably
well-preserved, apparently.

23:15.974 --> 23:19.675
The M.E. ran it through CODIS,
and it got a hit.

23:19.677 --> 23:22.137
Just say it, Erin.

23:25.579 --> 23:28.977
It matched your father,
Ennis Walker.

23:34.554 --> 23:36.625
(sighs)

23:36.627 --> 23:38.825
I knew it would.

23:38.827 --> 23:40.793
You did?

23:42.666 --> 23:44.192
I didn't close the case

23:44.194 --> 23:47.801
because closing it
would have finally meant

23:47.803 --> 23:49.969
confirming what I suspected.

23:49.971 --> 23:52.601
What I...

23:52.603 --> 23:55.775
dreaded.

23:57.776 --> 24:01.539
That my father
murdered my mother.

24:12.235 --> 24:15.004
NICKY: Can I have
everybody's attention, please?

24:16.605 --> 24:17.844
Turn that thing off.

24:17.846 --> 24:19.309
But it's for school.

24:19.311 --> 24:20.910
Then you tell the
school that I said

24:20.912 --> 24:22.981
there will be no
cameras, no cell phones,

24:22.983 --> 24:24.645
no screens of any kind

24:24.647 --> 24:28.148
at this table-- in the line
of duty, if necessary, excepted.

24:28.150 --> 24:29.388
(scoffs)

24:29.390 --> 24:31.188
Sanctuary, Nicky.

24:31.190 --> 24:32.692
Yeah.

24:32.694 --> 24:34.326
But it's for
my senior project.

24:34.328 --> 24:36.232
Moving on, please.
JACK: I don't see

24:36.234 --> 24:37.297
what the big deal is.

24:37.299 --> 24:39.202
LINDA: The big deal
is this is the time

24:39.204 --> 24:41.035
where we talk to each other
live and in person,

24:41.037 --> 24:42.139
and it's important.

24:42.141 --> 24:44.107
Trust us. You'll thank
us for it one day.

24:44.109 --> 24:46.010
You always say this.
It's true.

24:46.012 --> 24:47.674
What's it
for, anyway?

24:47.676 --> 24:50.450
I was supposed to be making
a video diary.

24:50.452 --> 24:51.714
JAMIE:
Yeah? What's the assignment?

24:51.716 --> 24:53.712
NICKY: We're supposed
to ask people we admire

24:53.714 --> 24:56.982
questions about their careers
and life choices, and then

24:56.984 --> 24:59.981
make a video presentation
summing up what we find.

24:59.983 --> 25:03.588
Okay, Nicky. Now that we're off
the record, what's the question?

25:03.590 --> 25:05.155
NICKY:
If you could go back in time,

25:05.157 --> 25:07.522
what advice would you give
to your younger self?

25:07.524 --> 25:11.561
If anyone asks you to be police
commissioner, keep walking.

25:11.563 --> 25:13.129
(chuckles)
LINDA: I'd say

25:13.131 --> 25:14.929
ask yourself
what you really want to be,

25:14.931 --> 25:16.833
and even
if it seems impossible,

25:16.835 --> 25:19.466
work really hard
to make it possible.

25:19.468 --> 25:21.370
Would you still be a nurse?

25:21.372 --> 25:22.770
No. I'd be a doctor.

25:22.772 --> 25:24.808
I'd still advise me
to be a cop.

25:24.810 --> 25:26.440
And to marry a nurse.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.472
Aw. Thank you.

25:28.474 --> 25:29.976
No, but really.
Really.

25:29.978 --> 25:31.808
Every cop needs
a guardian angel.

25:31.810 --> 25:33.112
That's sweet.

25:33.114 --> 25:35.481
But you still have to go
to my sister's birthday dinner.

25:35.483 --> 25:37.384
(laughter)
JACK: I would say

25:37.386 --> 25:38.856
work hard.

25:38.858 --> 25:39.784
You?

25:39.786 --> 25:41.824
Yeah, well,
play harder.

25:41.826 --> 25:43.288
Yeah, that sounds more like you.

25:43.290 --> 25:45.056
I don't really have
any advice for younger me

25:45.058 --> 25:47.833
'cause I still pretty
much am younger me.

25:47.835 --> 25:49.729
HENRY:
Live in the moment more.

25:49.731 --> 25:52.001
Planning is okay,
but it's not as important

25:52.003 --> 25:53.400
as being present in your life.

25:53.402 --> 25:55.135
'Cause we don't have

25:55.137 --> 25:56.533
an expiration date.

25:56.535 --> 25:58.331
JAMIE: Don't be so cautious.
You want to get anywhere,

25:58.333 --> 26:00.969
the only safe thing to do
is take a risk.

26:00.971 --> 26:02.169
I think
the most important advice

26:02.171 --> 26:03.568
I'd give to my younger self is

26:03.570 --> 26:06.176
don't tell your brothers
when you have a date.

26:06.178 --> 26:09.375
Mmm. And don't ask Laurie
Curtain to the prom.

26:09.377 --> 26:11.512
Yeah. Good call.

26:11.514 --> 26:13.376
JAMIE: Beg Rebecca Lawlor
not to take

26:13.378 --> 26:14.681
that job in Seattle.

26:14.683 --> 26:16.786
I knew you loved her.

26:16.788 --> 26:18.524
I knew it.

26:18.526 --> 26:19.789
Nicky,

26:19.791 --> 26:21.831
what would you tell
your younger self?

26:21.833 --> 26:25.695
Never forget
where you come from.

26:28.936 --> 26:30.205
Hear, hear.

26:30.207 --> 26:32.773
Copy that.

26:37.977 --> 26:41.552
Have you gotten anywhere in
the Benjamin Wilson case?

26:41.554 --> 26:44.520
I have a sneaker print
but no suspect.

26:44.522 --> 26:46.520
Nobody's talking.

26:46.522 --> 26:48.560
To us, anyway.

26:48.562 --> 26:50.089
Just to Anne Farrell.

26:50.091 --> 26:51.793
I spoke to the D.A.

26:51.795 --> 26:53.761
this morning;
he wants to subpoena her,

26:53.763 --> 26:56.201
force her to give up
the name of the killer.

26:56.203 --> 26:57.969
She'll just cite
the First Amendment.

26:57.971 --> 27:00.769
I may have found a way
around that.

27:02.738 --> 27:05.544
I can't have any part in it.

27:05.546 --> 27:07.912
Why? Because of the publicity?

27:07.914 --> 27:10.615
Because she is seen,
correctly, I think,

27:10.617 --> 27:13.511
as having an agenda
where I'm concerned.

27:13.513 --> 27:16.516
Might look
like a personal vendetta.

27:16.518 --> 27:19.513
It's also not ethical.

27:20.785 --> 27:24.548
Another thing
I'd say to my younger self:

27:24.550 --> 27:27.516
keep personal feelings
out of work.

27:27.518 --> 27:29.452
I reopened a case

27:29.454 --> 27:31.191
for a colleague,
thinking it might help,

27:31.193 --> 27:33.928
and instead it's just caused
a lot of hurt.

27:33.930 --> 27:36.862
I'm sure your intentions
were good.

27:36.864 --> 27:40.501
Yes. But we know
what that's used to pave.

27:46.438 --> 27:48.837
MAN:
<i>Motion to quash subpoena</i>

27:48.839 --> 27:52.245
in the matter of <i> Anne Farrell</i>

27:52.247 --> 27:54.748
<i>v. New York County</i>
<i>D.A.'s Office.</i>

27:54.750 --> 27:56.212
Your Honor,
this subpoena

27:56.214 --> 27:57.812
is a waste
of the court's time.

27:57.814 --> 28:00.851
Ms. Farrell is a professional
newscaster; she is protected

28:00.853 --> 28:03.115
under the First Amendment,
which states explicitly...

28:03.117 --> 28:05.491
I'm well aware of
the First Amendment, Counselor.

28:05.493 --> 28:07.227
Let's hear from the People.

28:07.229 --> 28:08.723
Your Honor,
Ms. Farrell interviewed

28:08.725 --> 28:10.193
an admitted killer...

28:10.195 --> 28:11.393
In her capacity
as a reporter.

28:11.395 --> 28:12.761
ERIN: If I may
finish, Your Honor.

28:12.763 --> 28:16.026
During that interview,
the man in question states

28:16.028 --> 28:19.957
that he killed Mr. Wilson
as part of a gang initiation,

28:19.959 --> 28:21.788
and suggests that initiation

28:21.790 --> 28:22.924
is ongoing.

28:22.926 --> 28:25.356
The First Amendment should
not offer protection

28:25.358 --> 28:27.531
when future crimes are at stake.

28:27.533 --> 28:30.027
COLBY: Ms. Farrell is not
an agent of the law.

28:30.029 --> 28:34.001
She cannot be mandated to comply
just because the D.A.'s office

28:34.003 --> 28:36.335
and the NYPD have not done
their due diligence

28:36.337 --> 28:38.598
in apprehending the
suspect in question.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.636
If I may, Your Honor,
the killer says...

28:40.638 --> 28:41.699
Objection.

28:41.701 --> 28:44.834
Sorry. The alleged
but admitted killer says

28:44.836 --> 28:47.042
that this is part
of the initiation,

28:47.044 --> 28:49.778
to murder a homeless person.

28:49.780 --> 28:52.073
And in answer to the question
will there be more killings,

28:52.075 --> 28:53.713
he says, “Hell yeah,

28:53.715 --> 28:55.913
everyone wants in.”

28:55.915 --> 28:57.984
He's stating an opinion,
not a fact.

28:58.850 --> 29:02.016
I agree with the People on this.

29:02.018 --> 29:04.986
Ms. Farrell will comply
with the subpoena.

29:04.988 --> 29:08.132
Ms. Farrell is asserting
her protection

29:08.134 --> 29:09.532
under the First Amendment

29:09.534 --> 29:10.964
of the Constitution

29:10.966 --> 29:12.836
and will not comply.

29:14.005 --> 29:15.731
Is this your final decision,
Ms. Farrell?

29:17.373 --> 29:19.036
Yes, it is, Your Honor.

29:19.038 --> 29:20.676
Then you will be held
in contempt of court

29:20.678 --> 29:21.973
for not complying
with a judicial order.

29:21.975 --> 29:24.108
You will be remanded
without bail

29:24.110 --> 29:26.044
until such time as you comply.

29:26.046 --> 29:28.212
(gavel bangs)

29:31.789 --> 29:33.986
(handcuffs clicking)

29:40.261 --> 29:41.993
DANNY:
<i>We got a van</i>

29:41.995 --> 29:44.697
and three unmarked cars
located here, here and here.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.097
BAEZ: Do we know how many
perps there'll be

29:46.099 --> 29:47.434
and what kind of car
they'll be driving?

29:47.436 --> 29:49.299
According to the C.I.,
we're looking at six perps,

29:49.301 --> 29:52.037
driving a black Charger
and possibly a van.

29:52.039 --> 29:54.375
They'll be entering through the
side door here on Haven Avenue.

29:54.377 --> 29:56.881
And over here we have
an undercover homeless man.

29:56.883 --> 29:58.553
CARVER: You got snipers?
DIAZ: Two snipers

29:58.555 --> 30:00.052
on the adjoining
rooftops.

30:00.054 --> 30:01.724
What's our time frame?

30:01.726 --> 30:04.598
1900 hours, tonight.
Excuse me.

30:04.600 --> 30:08.399
This is a private meeting
for low-paid civil servants.

30:08.401 --> 30:10.669
Good-bye.

30:10.671 --> 30:13.899
CARVER: Let's not forget this
is a residential area...

30:18.308 --> 30:20.039
(door buzzes)

30:26.345 --> 30:28.783
Surprised you agreed to see me.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.248
I'm surprised you had
the nerve to ask.

30:30.250 --> 30:33.289
I'm not the reason
you're in here.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.752
Why'd you come?

30:34.754 --> 30:37.623
To look you in the eye

30:37.625 --> 30:40.854
and say that to you
face-to-face, in person.

30:40.856 --> 30:42.126
Done.

30:42.128 --> 30:44.997
And to ask you to reconsider.

30:44.999 --> 30:48.167
(scoffs) Throw her in prison,
see if it softens her up?

30:53.208 --> 30:57.476
Somehow, I don't think
you're in any danger

30:57.478 --> 30:59.572
of it softening you up.

31:01.309 --> 31:02.979
What, then?

31:02.981 --> 31:04.946
(sighs)

31:04.948 --> 31:07.408
I'm not the enemy.

31:09.250 --> 31:11.720
Well, let's agree to disagree.

31:11.722 --> 31:13.921
Well, can we at least agree
on one thing?

31:15.387 --> 31:18.060
Mr. Wilson's murderer
belongs in here, not you.

31:18.062 --> 31:19.461
Plenty of blame
to go around.

31:19.463 --> 31:20.965
Some of it's on me,

31:20.967 --> 31:22.302
some of it's on you.

31:22.304 --> 31:25.871
Some of it's on every person
who saw what happened

31:25.873 --> 31:28.869
and did not call 911
or zipped their lips

31:28.871 --> 31:31.644
when the cops came around
asking for help.

31:31.646 --> 31:33.043
It's not my job to catch

31:33.045 --> 31:34.939
Benjamin Wilson's killer
for you.

31:34.941 --> 31:38.210
I don't think you'd feel
that way if it was your brother,

31:38.212 --> 31:40.113
or father.

31:41.915 --> 31:45.416
My job demands that I remain
objective, Commissioner.

31:45.418 --> 31:48.423
(sighs)
What I'm trying to do here...

31:48.425 --> 31:51.286
is not at all complicated.

31:51.288 --> 31:54.253
He lit a man on fire,

31:54.255 --> 31:57.660
and I'm trying to arrest him
for it.

31:57.662 --> 32:01.531
Absent that, I want to hear
a damn good reason

32:01.533 --> 32:04.667
why he should not be arrested.

32:06.871 --> 32:10.142
And you don't have one.

32:26.011 --> 32:28.578
So who's this narcotics guy
you're dating?

32:29.451 --> 32:31.481
I'm not saying.

32:33.355 --> 32:35.320
Is he on the operation tonight?

32:35.322 --> 32:37.656
Maybe. Maybe not.

32:37.658 --> 32:39.023
Why won't you tell me?

32:39.025 --> 32:41.422
Because you get all judgmental
and stuff.

32:41.424 --> 32:42.694
I'm not judgmental.

32:42.696 --> 32:43.894
I'm your partner.

32:43.896 --> 32:45.158
I'm... a little protective.

32:45.160 --> 32:46.725
I tell you the truth.

32:48.335 --> 32:50.869
A little judgmental.
Mm.

32:56.069 --> 32:57.371
Here they are.

32:57.373 --> 32:59.571
They just pulled up,
two vehicles.

32:59.573 --> 33:01.738
Black Charger,
can't make out the plate.

33:01.740 --> 33:03.945
(over radio):
Black van, New York plate,

33:03.947 --> 33:05.976
Sam-Robert-Queen...

33:05.978 --> 33:08.311
five-six-three-five.

33:09.113 --> 33:12.478
Looks like we got six of 'em.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.918
Son of a bitch.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.255
Is that Charelle?

33:19.593 --> 33:20.927
What the hell is she doing here?

33:20.929 --> 33:22.592
We got to get her out of here
before they come out.

33:22.594 --> 33:24.758
Wait, it's too late, Danny;
they're already coming out.

33:26.032 --> 33:28.798
All units be advised,
we got a friendly on set--

33:28.800 --> 33:29.998
female, black, pink vest.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.270
Copy that.

33:31.272 --> 33:32.902
They're coming out.
Let's take 'em.

33:32.904 --> 33:34.069
Damn it!

33:34.071 --> 33:35.901
Team out.

33:35.903 --> 33:37.774
Go, go, go.
Police!

33:37.776 --> 33:39.343
Freeze!
Nobody move!

33:39.345 --> 33:40.945
Police!
Drop it!

33:42.316 --> 33:43.449
Hold it!

33:44.820 --> 33:45.722
Hands up!

33:45.724 --> 33:47.588
Hey!

33:51.800 --> 33:54.428
Take the door.
I'll cover you.

34:16.516 --> 34:18.683
(door closes)

34:29.704 --> 34:31.870
(Charelle screams, sobs)

34:31.871 --> 34:34.668
BAEZ:
Police! Put the gun down!

34:34.670 --> 34:36.540
(Charelle crying)
You put it down!

34:36.542 --> 34:37.706
Or I'll kill her.

34:37.708 --> 34:38.739
Put it down!

34:38.741 --> 34:39.706
Back off!

34:39.708 --> 34:40.976
BAEZ:
Okay, okay.

34:40.978 --> 34:43.513
Hurry up!
Just calm down.

34:47.712 --> 34:49.677
Hurry up, now back off!

34:51.551 --> 34:53.643
Charelle? It's okay.

34:53.646 --> 34:55.315
(Charelle crying)

34:56.349 --> 34:57.349
You okay?

34:59.358 --> 35:01.221
You all right?

35:02.327 --> 35:03.990
“And furthermore,

35:03.992 --> 35:05.630
regarding Freedom
of Information..”"

35:05.632 --> 35:07.262
Commissioner.

35:07.264 --> 35:08.293
Yeah?

35:08.295 --> 35:09.333
We just got a break.

35:09.335 --> 35:10.700
An anonymous tip,

35:10.702 --> 35:13.495
giving us the name of the person
that killed Benjamin Wilson.

35:14.328 --> 35:16.228
That's great news.

35:16.230 --> 35:18.065
Yeah, we got detectives
picking him up right now.

35:18.067 --> 35:19.697
I need to talk
to Wilson's family,

35:19.699 --> 35:21.663
tell them before
the story breaks.

35:21.665 --> 35:22.862
Will do.

35:23.696 --> 35:25.997
No idea who called it in?

35:25.999 --> 35:27.565
No.

35:28.407 --> 35:30.531
Good news.

35:30.533 --> 35:32.234
Congrats.

35:38.007 --> 35:39.869
What the hell
were you thinking?

35:39.871 --> 35:41.109
Huh?

35:41.111 --> 35:42.405
I'm writing a story.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.771
I needed to know how it ended.

35:43.773 --> 35:45.839
It could've ended with
all of us dead, thanks to you!

35:45.841 --> 35:47.659
How did you even know
where we were?

35:47.684 --> 35:48.912
The board.

35:48.913 --> 35:50.208
The what?
The board in Carver's office

35:50.210 --> 35:52.176
that you guys used
to plan it on.

35:52.178 --> 35:53.647
It had the address on there,
all the details.

35:53.649 --> 35:57.150
How can somebody this smart be
this stupid at the same time?

35:57.152 --> 35:59.749
Maybe it was stupid for you guys
to leave it out.

35:59.751 --> 36:02.516
You do realize
you just committed a crime?

36:03.358 --> 36:05.020
So?

36:05.022 --> 36:06.956
What did you say?

36:06.958 --> 36:07.859
What?

36:07.861 --> 36:09.226
Did you say, “So?”

36:10.156 --> 36:11.928
So how about I arrest you then?
What? Wait!

36:11.930 --> 36:13.792
How about that? Yeah.
You're gonna be processed

36:13.794 --> 36:15.065
and transported down
to Central Booking

36:15.067 --> 36:16.561
where you will
await arraignment.

36:16.563 --> 36:18.034
(handcuffs clicking)
I'm sorry.

36:18.036 --> 36:19.267
You think you're sorry now?

36:19.269 --> 36:20.572
You wait until
the next time you screw up.

36:20.574 --> 36:21.708
You're 16 years old.

36:21.710 --> 36:24.172
That is an adult
in the eyes of the law!

36:24.174 --> 36:25.970
There's not going to be
any more Rescue Rides

36:25.972 --> 36:27.578
or hanging out with cops
or juvie.

36:27.580 --> 36:29.610
You'll go straight to Rikers!

36:31.180 --> 36:32.978
Why are you
doing this?

36:32.980 --> 36:34.450
Why am I doing this?

36:34.452 --> 36:35.883
Because I can't rescue you.

36:35.885 --> 36:38.418
Neither can she and neither
can Lieutenant Carver.

36:38.420 --> 36:40.289
The only person who can rescue
you now is yourself.

36:40.291 --> 36:42.288
So you think about that
while you're in

36:42.290 --> 36:43.592
a holding cell
with a bunch of animals,

36:43.594 --> 36:44.960
and then you decide
what the hell

36:44.962 --> 36:47.360
you're gonna do
with the rest of your life.

36:47.362 --> 36:48.928
Get her out of here.

36:48.930 --> 36:51.600
Go.

37:02.010 --> 37:04.144
(footsteps approaching)

37:12.221 --> 37:14.257
I'm surprised
you showed up.

37:14.259 --> 37:15.951
I'm surprised you asked.

37:18.025 --> 37:20.958
You did ask me for a drink,
so buy me a drink?

37:20.960 --> 37:22.390
Bartender?

37:22.392 --> 37:24.663
I'll have what he's having.
Yes, ma'am.

37:26.905 --> 37:29.071
(sighs)

37:32.938 --> 37:34.944
Thanks for getting
the charges dropped.

37:34.946 --> 37:36.240
I did no such thing.

37:36.242 --> 37:37.807
I'm calling you on that.

37:37.809 --> 37:39.310
Show me your sources.

37:39.312 --> 37:40.541
They're protected.

37:40.543 --> 37:42.517
Unless you want
to throw me back in jail?

37:42.519 --> 37:45.449
I didn't do that either.

37:47.315 --> 37:50.048
Congratulations on your arrest.

37:50.050 --> 37:53.016
Any idea who made
the anonymous call?

37:53.018 --> 37:54.552
I would think you know better

37:54.554 --> 37:57.623
than to ask this reporter
that question.

37:59.456 --> 38:01.422
He gave us a full confession.

38:01.424 --> 38:03.429
They say it's good
for the soul.

38:03.431 --> 38:06.291
Well, in that case,

38:06.293 --> 38:10.234
I will admit that we have
a long way to go in Brownsville.

38:10.236 --> 38:12.159
And other neighborhoods.

38:12.161 --> 38:15.997
I might not have given
the most balanced picture.

38:15.999 --> 38:17.501
Might not have?

38:17.503 --> 38:19.900
I'm calling dibs
on first access to him.

38:19.902 --> 38:21.333
You owe me that.

38:21.335 --> 38:23.237
To paint him as a victim.

38:23.239 --> 38:25.372
A cautionary tale.

38:26.206 --> 38:28.540
You guys and your semantics.

38:28.542 --> 38:30.510
You notice that not even
your cop cars

38:30.512 --> 38:32.015
are black and white anymore?

38:32.017 --> 38:34.153
You think that up
on the way over here?

38:41.028 --> 38:42.426
Cheers.

38:42.428 --> 38:43.594
Cheers.

38:43.596 --> 38:45.002
That's off the record.

38:45.004 --> 38:47.833
Of course.

38:57.175 --> 38:59.244
CARVER:
Detective?

38:59.246 --> 39:00.275
Yes.

39:00.277 --> 39:02.210
Charelle is still
in holding.

39:02.212 --> 39:03.577
Yep.

39:03.579 --> 39:07.278
You haven't gotten a 61 or
filled out the online booking.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.140
No, and I'm not going to.

39:09.142 --> 39:10.811
I figure a few hours in holding

39:10.813 --> 39:13.347
ought to scare
some sense into her.

39:13.349 --> 39:15.379
You think this is the
right approach with her?

39:15.381 --> 39:17.419
Yes.

39:17.421 --> 39:19.387
Did you know,
when I was 12 years old,

39:19.389 --> 39:22.123
I decided to skip school
for the first time?

39:22.125 --> 39:24.459
A local cop saw me
walking around

39:24.461 --> 39:26.227
86th Street,
decided to call my old man,

39:26.229 --> 39:27.859
figuring he'd come get me.

39:27.861 --> 39:29.099
Only, he didn't.

39:29.101 --> 39:31.299
I was taken to the precinct
and slapped

39:31.301 --> 39:33.435
with a juvenile delinquent card,
and guess what?

39:34.533 --> 39:37.571
I never skipped school again.

39:46.284 --> 39:48.145
I thought your case
was adjourned.

39:48.147 --> 39:50.143
It was.

39:50.145 --> 39:51.782
Why you still here?

39:51.784 --> 39:55.180
I was actually looking for you.

39:57.119 --> 39:58.652
(sighs)

40:01.054 --> 40:03.987
I'm sorry that I reopened
your mother's case.

40:03.989 --> 40:05.995
Why?

40:05.997 --> 40:10.563
It wasn't exactly
the outcome I had expected.

40:13.436 --> 40:15.697
I only saw my father...

40:15.699 --> 40:18.967
a handful of times growing up.

40:18.969 --> 40:20.599
I reached out to him years ago,

40:20.601 --> 40:23.007
before I suspected
he was involved,

40:23.009 --> 40:25.175
but he wasn't interested.

40:27.513 --> 40:30.015
He died before I could
even ask him about it.

40:30.017 --> 40:32.583
Why do you think he did it?

40:32.585 --> 40:34.615
My grandma told me

40:34.617 --> 40:37.522
my mom was gonna move
us out of the city,

40:37.524 --> 40:40.596
and when my father found
out, he got upset...

40:40.598 --> 40:43.594
said he wasn't gonna
let her leave New York.

40:43.596 --> 40:46.465
Well, I guess he got
what he wanted.

40:46.467 --> 40:50.497
The thing that I keep thinking
about is...

40:50.499 --> 40:53.569
how this is a part
of who I am now.

40:55.339 --> 40:57.137
The son of a killer.

40:57.139 --> 40:58.745
That's not who you are.

40:58.747 --> 41:01.114
It's easy for you to say;
look at your family.

41:01.116 --> 41:04.248
Any murderers in
your bloodline?

41:06.849 --> 41:09.553
When I found out your father
had an arrest record,

41:09.555 --> 41:11.186
I went down to
the Property Clerk's office

41:11.188 --> 41:13.163
and asked to see
all the property vouchered

41:13.165 --> 41:14.859
from his last arrest.

41:14.861 --> 41:17.427
Why? DNA is a perfect match.

41:17.429 --> 41:20.235
I wasn't looking
for DNA.

41:21.101 --> 41:23.602
I was looking for this.

41:32.039 --> 41:34.372
He never reclaimed it.

41:37.182 --> 41:39.876
Guess he didn't want
any reminders.

41:40.982 --> 41:43.854
You said that your mother
was always helping people,

41:43.856 --> 41:46.686
even when you were struggling.

41:49.328 --> 41:52.590
That's your legacy, Alex.

41:55.331 --> 41:58.067
Thank you, Erin.
