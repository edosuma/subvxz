- Your time starts now.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.160
- Go ahead and lay back for me.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.412
- Round three.

09:39.495 --> 09:40.621
- Only 90 minutes.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.999
{\an3}It's going really
freaking quick every time.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.628
<i>Chris drew a triangle</i>
<i>with an eye in it.</i>

09:47.712 --> 09:49.922
{\an8}Definitely something
extremely simple-looking,

09:50.006 --> 09:54.093
but my canvas wants to put it
on her sternum area,

09:54.176 --> 09:54.844
which definitely is a handful.

09:57.179 --> 09:58.848
- 15 minutes to go.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.186
- What's going on, guys?
- What's up, boss?

10:05.229 --> 10:07.857
{\an1}- Tell you what,
90 minutes goes by pretty fast.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.859
{\an8}- Fine-line black and gray
seems to be the style

10:09.942 --> 10:12.236
that's exposing
everybody's weaknesses...

10:12.320 --> 10:13.904
even Chris's own weaknesses.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.368
- Time is up.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.870
- Third one down.
- Yes.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.874
- And Kruseman's color
Japanese design is next.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.375
{\an8}- Here you go.
A daruma doll.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.877
{\an8}- What the hell's a daruma?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.045
{\an8}Where the hell's his other eye?

10:29.128 --> 10:30.296
{\an8}- That's for you to figure out.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.589
{\an8}You've been
tattooing for 20 years,

10:31.672 --> 10:33.174
{\an8}and you don't know
what a daruma doll is?

10:33.257 --> 10:34.800
- Oh, daruma.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.844
{\an3}- Chris was asking me
where his other eye was.

10:36.927 --> 10:37.720
{\an1}- [laughs]

10:37.803 --> 10:39.722
- You have 90 minutes to tattoo,

10:39.805 --> 10:42.058
and your time starts now.

10:42.141 --> 10:45.603
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

10:45.686 --> 10:47.521
- Last go round.
- Let's do it.

10:50.524 --> 10:51.776
- Comfortable?
- Yup.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.529
- I'm so focused right now.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.615
{\an8}All I need to do
is 90 more minutes.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.658
{\an8}One more tattoo
and I'm in that finale.

11:02.661 --> 11:03.746
- 45 minutes.

11:03.829 --> 11:04.789
- Are you serious?

11:07.208 --> 11:10.544
{\an8}I'm using a very traditional
approach to this daruma doll.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.838
Everything that I busted my ass
for in this competition

11:12.922 --> 11:14.840
comes down
to these four tattoos.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.885
There is no way I'm not
making it to the finale.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.846
I've worked too hard
to lose it at this point.

11:20.930 --> 11:24.767
- Five, four, three, two, one...

11:24.850 --> 11:25.267
That's it, time's up.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.602
Machines down.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.312
No more ink.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.108
- I would say
we just murdered that one.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.943
- You were wonderful today.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.611
- Thank you. You were awesome.
- I appreciate it.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.530
You sat through it, man.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.115
- There's no doubt in my mind

11:39.198 --> 11:41.784
{\an8}that Craig Foster blew every one
of these tattoos.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.954
His popsicle is
the worst one here.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.330
You're the worst tattoo
in your own category.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.499
The colors are muted.

11:48.582 --> 11:49.458
It looks weak.

11:49.542 --> 11:49.834
You really blew it, Craig.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.089
{\an3}Mother[bleep] gonna come at me
right at the end.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.257
- I'm glad you had to do it.
- The thing's bulletproof.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.968
- This is a slam dunk.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.761
- This thing
just looks pretty rough.

12:00.845 --> 12:01.929
- These are the four roughest
tattoos I've seen from you.

12:04.723 --> 12:09.353
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

12:09.437 --> 12:11.480
- You know, the only one tattoo

12:11.564 --> 12:13.899
{\an3}I didn't want to do here
was a mandala.

12:13.983 --> 12:14.900
- I'm glad you had to do it.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.485
{\an3}- You just set out
to give me a bad day

12:16.569 --> 12:18.404
{\an3}this far into the competition.
I was pissed off about it.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.655
{\an3}Mother[bleep] gonna come at me
right at the end,

12:19.738 --> 12:22.450
{\an3}knowing that I can't
come back at you.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.410
{\an1}- Man, that kind of job's
a fundamental tattoo.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.412
{\an3}- Considering
the other two people

12:26.495 --> 12:27.496
{\an3}aren't necessarily the best
line work people either,

12:27.580 --> 12:29.582
you didn't give me a bad day,

12:29.665 --> 12:32.877
{\an3}but you probably
gave one of them a bad day.

{\an8}<i>[dramatic music]</i>

12:45.639 --> 12:47.808
- This week, you had to prove
your endurance and versatility

12:47.892 --> 12:50.186
in a tattoo marathon.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.272
A trip to the live finale
is on the line.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.485
Let's see how you did.

12:57.568 --> 12:58.986
Matt.

13:01.071 --> 13:02.490
How did you find the marathon,

13:02.573 --> 13:04.909
the banging out four different
styles, different tattoos,

13:04.992 --> 13:06.202
in a short amount of time?

13:06.285 --> 13:07.411
- I mean, honestly it's
a very intense thing, for sure.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.705
- You had artist's choice,

13:09.788 --> 13:12.333
and you chose to do a geometric
black-and-gray tattoo.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.585
{\an1}- This tattoo is really
about consistency.

13:14.668 --> 13:17.004
You have all the different
elements, very equidistant.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.422
Line work...super tight,

13:18.506 --> 13:21.383
{\an1}and I think it
came out really strong.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.177
{\an8}- Next up is Craig's
new school popsicle.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.138
{\an9}- The color in this
is really strong,

13:26.222 --> 13:27.306
{\an8}really saturated,

13:27.389 --> 13:28.390
{\an9}and I really commend you
on just the outline

13:28.474 --> 13:30.392
{\an8}on the outside of this.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.353
{\an8}Really perfect, bold outline

13:32.436 --> 13:34.104
{\an9}that's consistent
all the way around.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.481
{\an8}The thing's bulletproof.

13:35.564 --> 13:39.276
{\an8}- Next up is Chris's
fine-line black and gray design.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.737
{\an9}- This one is the one that I see
the most struggle.

13:41.820 --> 13:45.157
{\an9}The big outside perimeter
of that pupil--it's wobbly.

13:45.241 --> 13:45.908
{\an8}Under the bottom lid--

13:45.991 --> 13:48.369
{\an8}very undone under the eyelashes,

13:48.452 --> 13:50.329
{\an8}and it stands out
like a sore thumb.

13:50.412 --> 13:53.207
{\an8}- Next up is
Kruseman's daruma doll.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.209
{\an7}- I really like the solid,
simple approach

13:55.292 --> 13:56.335
{\an8}you took to this tattoo.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.753
{\an7}Just doing black shading
in the face

13:57.836 --> 13:59.338
{\an7}with just that little bit
of tone underneath the eyes

13:59.421 --> 14:02.299
{\an7}is a very traditional way
of approaching this.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.425
{\an1}Very little areas
for me to complain about.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.474
- Craig.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.267
How did you find
the whole marathon

14:11.350 --> 14:13.269
aspect of this challenge?

14:13.352 --> 14:14.520
- Just the 90 minutes.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.480
It sounds like a lot of time
until you're tattooing.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.232
That was probably
the biggest challenge.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.442
- First up is Matt's
geometric design.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.404
This just looks rushed
and messy and frankly

14:23.487 --> 14:24.446
doesn't look like anything
I've ever seen you do.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.282
- I had a plan how to do it,

14:26.365 --> 14:28.659
but then the time catching up--

14:28.742 --> 14:31.704
I really felt like I was not
gonna finish this whole thing.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.664
{\an3}- There are so many rough areas
of outline in here

14:33.747 --> 14:37.543
{\an3}and just so many places
this thing got away from you.

14:37.626 --> 14:38.877
- Next up is your own design.

14:38.961 --> 14:42.256
{\an7}- It just doesn't have a lot
of colorful pop to it

14:42.339 --> 14:43.299
{\an7}like I was expecting it
to from you.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.925
{\an7}The black shading underneath
with the color

14:45.009 --> 14:47.011
{\an8}saturated over top--

14:47.094 --> 14:48.178
{\an8}it's just not as smooth.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.138
{\an7}Getting rattled
on that first tat,

14:49.221 --> 14:51.890
{\an7}I think it's evident
in your second tattoo.

14:51.974 --> 14:55.269
{\an8}- Chris's fine line black
and gray design.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.021
{\an8}- There's some nice dimension
to this eye.

14:57.104 --> 15:00.065
{\an8}It does look wet, but when you
get up on this thing,

15:00.149 --> 15:01.650
{\an8}it looks a little rushed.

15:01.734 --> 15:05.279
{\an8}- The perimeter outline of this
triangle has a lot of problems.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.323
{\an8}It is not consistent.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.449
{\an7}This thing just looks
pretty rough.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.160
{\an8}- Kruseman's daruma doll.

15:11.243 --> 15:12.995
{\an9}- I definitely like the skin
tone that you used in the face.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.372
{\an8}I just wish it was solid.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.332
{\an8}It's just patchy and messy.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.708
{\an9}The mouth is in there
pretty haphazard.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.376
{\an8}Those simple little red lines--

15:19.460 --> 15:21.545
{\an8}at least close that up

15:21.629 --> 15:24.048
{\an9}and make it as dark and solid
as your two edges.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.758
Today you definitely shook.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.885
These are the four roughest
tattoos I've seen from you.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.804
- God damn.

15:30.888 --> 15:31.513
- Kruseman.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.810
So how was
the tattoo marathon for you?

15:36.894 --> 15:38.437
- Insane.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.481
- First up is Matt's
geometric design.

15:40.564 --> 15:43.359
{\an1}- The small areas you chose
to just do solid black

15:43.442 --> 15:45.361
{\an1}versus the areas you chose
to leave open

15:45.444 --> 15:47.738
{\an1}helped the structure
of this design be legible.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.324
{\an1}It's got a few
little hiccups in it,

15:50.407 --> 15:51.742
but overall, I think it's clean.

15:51.825 --> 15:54.453
{\an8}- Craig's new school design.

15:54.536 --> 15:56.747
{\an7}- The orange creamsicle color
is nice,

15:56.830 --> 15:59.625
{\an7}but everybody else did a lot
of interesting color play

15:59.708 --> 16:02.753
{\an7}between the actually popsicle
itself and the bite.

16:02.836 --> 16:06.256
{\an8}You kind of didn't get that
dynamic color play in there.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.717
{\an8}- Chris's design, the fine line
black-and-gray tattoo.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.345
{\an7}- Your choice to not do
an outline around the perimeter

16:11.428 --> 16:13.013
{\an7}of the triangle
was kind of a risky move,

16:13.097 --> 16:15.224
{\an8}and you had smoother,

16:15.307 --> 16:17.643
{\an7}softer grays
in your geometric tattoo

16:17.726 --> 16:19.478
{\an7}than you have in your fine line
black-and-gray tattoo.

16:19.561 --> 16:20.562
{\an7}And I think
that's a little weird.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.148
- Next up is your daruma doll
design.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.483
- You drew up something cool.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.568
{\an3}Really, man,
what sets this tattoo off

16:26.652 --> 16:29.571
{\an3}is just the solid one-tone
packed red.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.656
Very graphic, very simple.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.449
{\an3}Definitely shows to me
that this was your design,

16:32.533 --> 16:36.203
and you owned it.

16:36.286 --> 16:40.749
- Chris.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.334
Were any of the designs

16:42.418 --> 16:43.627
challenging
for you specifically?

16:43.711 --> 16:45.838
- The mandala was the one
I was most worried about.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.923
{\an1}- Where I think you lost it
in this tattoo was the shading.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.883
{\an1}Trying to get
this stipple effect,

16:49.967 --> 16:51.927
{\an1}you end up
with these little dash marks.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.680
{\an3}- Better to just
do the black and gray

16:54.763 --> 16:56.098
{\an3}that you know and achieve
those softer effects.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.599
This just looks unfinished.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.855
- Craig's new school design.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.106
{\an8}I love the palette that you
chose to use here,

17:04.189 --> 17:06.608
{\an8}the teeth marks going all
the way through

17:06.692 --> 17:07.776
the different layers.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.444
I'm also a fan of the texture

17:09.528 --> 17:10.695
you put
into the popsicle itself.

17:10.779 --> 17:14.407
This is night and day
from that geometric tattoo.

17:14.491 --> 17:18.328
{\an8}Next up is your black
and gray tattoo.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.496
{\an9}- The lashes
in this are beautiful.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.458
{\an9}The very soft little
gray-line veins in the eye--

17:22.540 --> 17:25.294
{\an9}it's not overbearing
and overwhelming.

17:25.377 --> 17:25.877
{\an8}Everything looks deliberate.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.546
It's really strong.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.798
- Kruseman's daruma doll.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.550
- Out of the gate, man, strike.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.469
{\an9}The white line
under the red lip--

17:33.552 --> 17:34.762
{\an8}it's not symmetrical.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.722
{\an9}It's not laid out
for any particular purpose.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.432
{\an8}- We felt that he was
sticking his bottom lip out.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.058
{\an8}She wanted that kind
of sad look.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.101
{\an7}- If it's gonna be in there,
it's got to be in there perfect,

17:41.185 --> 17:43.395
{\an8}nice, and smooth.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.646
{\an8}It's not your best tattoo today,

17:44.730 --> 17:47.024
{\an8}but it's also not your worst.

17:53.322 --> 17:53.989
- Time to poll the judges.

17:54.072 --> 17:56.658
Who wins the tattoo marathon?

17:56.742 --> 17:58.660
{\an1}- Going through this
tattoo by tattoo,

17:58.744 --> 17:59.787
{\an1}the biggest landslide victory
of the day

17:59.870 --> 18:02.539
was in Matt's geometric tattoo.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.749
{\an8}It's the most concentric.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.043
{\an7}Matt definitely wins this
four-way battle right here.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.796
{\an8}- I agree with that. Chris?
- I do too.

18:08.879 --> 18:11.006
{\an8}- Next up,
Craig's popsicle design.

18:11.089 --> 18:14.384
{\an7}- I'm surprised that Craig
isn't the obvious winner here.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.928
{\an8}- I really like what Craig did,

18:16.011 --> 18:18.055
{\an8}but just the overall vibrance
isn't there,

18:18.138 --> 18:21.475
{\an8}where I see it
in Chris's and in Matt's too.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.602
{\an8}- I really like the cleanliness

18:23.685 --> 18:24.937
{\an9}that Matt pulls off
in this thing.

18:25.020 --> 18:28.273
{\an7}- Matt coming out and showing us
this color bomb saturation

18:28.357 --> 18:30.234
{\an7}does show a lot
more versatility.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.485
{\an8}I'm leaning towards Matt.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.988
{\an8}- Chris's fine line
black and gray was a slam dunk.

18:35.072 --> 18:35.864
{\an7}- Yeah, I'm definitely
going with Chris on this one.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.950
{\an8}- I agree.
- Okay, next up,

18:38.033 --> 18:41.453
we have
Kruseman's daruma doll design.

18:41.537 --> 18:42.871
- Kruseman owning this design

18:42.955 --> 18:44.706
{\an3}and executing it the way
he did--

18:44.790 --> 18:45.666
to me, Kruseman takes it.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.126
{\an7}- I love the gray
in the face of Kruseman's.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.964
{\an8}I love the blanket solid skin
tone that he put in the face.

18:52.047 --> 18:55.467
{\an7}It's very graphic, very typical
Japanese way to approach it.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.845
{\an1}I got to go with Kruseman
on this one.

18:57.928 --> 19:01.557
- So everybody here, except
for Craig, won their design.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.725
- Matt won two challenges today.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.811
- I think it's
pretty clear then.

19:05.894 --> 19:08.605
{\an1}- For overall versatility,
Matt came out.

19:08.689 --> 19:09.982
- The judges have decided.

19:10.065 --> 19:13.819
The winner
of the tattoo marathon is Matt.

19:14.736 --> 19:17.030
Matt, that is not all.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.909
You also...

19:20.993 --> 19:23.245
earned your spot
in the live finale.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.999
Congratulations.

19:27.082 --> 19:27.207
{\an1}- Yes.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.463
- How's it feel, big fella?
- Feels great.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.756
That's [bleep] awesome.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.300
{\an1}I couldn't be
any more stoked right now.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.260
- Welcome to the big show.

19:39.094 --> 19:42.222
- There are three of you left,

19:42.306 --> 19:45.350
but only two spots remain
in the finale.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.811
You'll have one last chance

19:47.895 --> 19:51.273
to prove you deserve
one of those spots.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.734
Two of you will move on
to compete with Matt,

19:53.817 --> 19:55.694

I was gone for, like, 18 months.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.316
"I wanna be a tattoo artist,"

20:34.399 --> 20:35.692
{\an1}and I remember her just
kinda looking at me,

20:35.776 --> 20:37.319
she kinda teared up,

20:37.402 --> 20:39.237
and she gave me 100 bucks.

21:29.121 --> 21:29.830

{\an3}You must tattoo it
one more time,

{\an3}and this time,
you've got to nail it.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.112
Chris, you must redo
your phoenix tattoo.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.239
- [bleep].

22:04.322 --> 22:06.241
{\an7}- Don't really have any
real definition of feathers.

22:06.324 --> 22:06.908
{\an7}It just looks like a big
red parrot

22:06.992 --> 22:08.201
{\an8}with a more evil head on it.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.288

at this whole competition,

22:18.879 --> 22:20.422
and this phoenix
is gonna get me into the finale.

22:20.505 --> 22:24.843
{\an3}- Kruseman, you must tattoo
a stained-glass carousel horse.

22:26.344 --> 22:28.805
{\an1}- You got the same colors
and the same tones

22:28.889 --> 22:31.016
{\an1}of the same colors in
the foreground and background,

22:31.099 --> 22:32.350

22:33.351 --> 22:34.436
of looking like
a carousel horse.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.979
It didn't really meet

This could be the downfall

I really don't know how to do
this style of tattooing.

22:47.365 --> 22:52.621

your Neptune tattoo.

{\an1}- This is the least dynamic
thing you've probably ever done.

22:54.498 --> 22:58.919
You put on this terrible
grayish-blue all over it,

22:59.002 --> 23:00.796

all our major design fails,

going into this challenge is,

Obviously, black and gray's
been his big struggle,

25:54.552 --> 25:55.804
{\an1}which is maybe why he's
going black and gray now.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.264
{\an3}- Yeah, but color is more
of a struggle for him

25:57.347 --> 26:00.517

I cannot go home now
over this silly little phoenix.

26:42.100 --> 26:45.145
- Five, four,

26:45.228 --> 26:46.771
three, two,

26:46.855 --> 26:49.357
one...

26:49.441 --> 26:50.775
That is it. Time's up.

26:50.859 --> 26:51.609
Machines down.
No more ink.

26:53.611 --> 26:55.447
- All right,
I'll gonna get you up.

26:55.530 --> 26:56.656
- That's awesome.

26:57.699 --> 26:58.283
- Craig's been struggling
with his saturation

26:58.366 --> 27:00.994
for the last couple weeks,

27:01.077 --> 27:02.454
so instead of taking it
on head-to-head,

27:02.537 --> 27:04.622
he decides to puss out
and do black and gray.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.082
- Done real good, man.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.835
- And for that reason alone,
you should go home.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.089
You're full of [bleep]!

27:13.173 --> 27:14.549
{\an1}There was no doubt that it was
you and me going for the finale.

27:14.632 --> 27:17.344
{\an3}- And now that you got
some level of doubt,

27:17.427 --> 27:18.386
you [bleep] goddamn
losing your [bleep].

27:18.470 --> 27:20.388
{\an1}- Just did not meet
the challenge.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.474
- You feel that their critiques

27:22.557 --> 27:23.558
are ingenuine?
- Sometimes.

27:23.641 --> 27:29.189
- Maybe we have it wrong
to have you here.

27:29.272 --> 27:32.942
<i>[rock music]</i>

27:33.026 --> 27:34.444

27:34.527 --> 27:36.905
- This the first time you've
ever done an Oriental phoenix?

27:36.988 --> 27:38.865
- Yeah.
- The wings were flip-flopped.

27:38.948 --> 27:40.075
The outer feathers were folding
the wrong direction.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.410
{\an3}- Hmm.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.788
- I think the fine line work

27:44.871 --> 27:46.998
will be another thing
that they're gonna hit you on.

27:47.082 --> 27:47.665
{\an3}- I think you're full

27:47.749 --> 27:48.750
Here it is now at the end.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.961
{\an3}You're still gonna [bleep]
run your mouth

27:52.045 --> 27:53.004
like you're a better tattoo
artist than everybody else.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.631
- No, I just--I'm--
- You're full of [bleep].

27:54.714 --> 27:57.634
- I'm not saying--
- Shut up, I'm still talking.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.718
Every time I had a good tattoo,

27:58.802 --> 28:02.097
{\an3}this fat [bleep]
from Arkansas has some comment.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.306
- Come on, dude.

28:03.390 --> 28:04.933
Why do you have to be
a dick about [bleep]?

28:05.016 --> 28:07.310
{\an1}Why can't you just be a man like
the rest of the people in here

28:07.394 --> 28:08.395
and take a critique, dude?
- Are you [bleep] kidding me?

28:08.478 --> 28:09.938
Never once am I an asshole.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.356
- You're the one that's bringing
personal bull[bleep], bro.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.274
To sit here and call me fat?

28:13.358 --> 28:15.443
That's low bull[bleep].

28:15.527 --> 28:17.946
{\an8}Chris is just a [bleep] bully.

28:18.029 --> 28:18.947
Man, I don't have anything else
to [bleep].

28:19.030 --> 28:20.615
- [laughing]
- I don't have anything else--

28:20.698 --> 28:22.033
{\an3}- You're such a little [bleep]
girl. Walk away.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.661
- No, but I just don't have
anything else to say to you,

28:24.744 --> 28:26.996
{\an3}and I'm not gonna sit here
and take this [bleep].

28:27.914 --> 28:30.917
{\an1}- Since the beginning
of the competition,

28:31.000 --> 28:32.961
{\an1}it's always been you and me
going at each other,

28:33.044 --> 28:34.295
and up until this phoenix,

28:34.379 --> 28:35.964
There was no doubt that it was
you and me going to the finale.

28:36.047 --> 28:39.509
- And now that you got some...
- That's not disrespect to you.

28:39.592 --> 28:41.719
{\an3}- Level of doubt, you're [bleep]
goddamn losing your [bleep].

28:48.059 --> 28:49.644
- I hope that critique
goes well for me today.

28:49.727 --> 28:50.770
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.903
<i>[intense music]</i>

29:02.574 --> 29:04.742
- Today each of you tattooed
head-to-head against yourself.

29:06.786 --> 29:07.996
This was your last chance

29:08.079 --> 29:12.000
to prove that you deserve a spot
in the live finale.

29:13.460 --> 29:13.501
Chris, let's start with you.

29:16.671 --> 29:19.507
{\an8}My comments were
that there was no detail

29:19.591 --> 29:22.510
{\an8}in your previous phoenix,

29:22.594 --> 29:25.847
{\an8}and this is what I was talking
about, seeing the feathers,

29:25.930 --> 29:27.140
{\an8}seeing the different textures.

29:27.223 --> 29:31.019
{\an8}I really liked this so much
better than the previous one.

29:31.102 --> 29:34.355
- Getting into the technical
application of this tattoo--

29:34.439 --> 29:35.565
a lot of bright colors,

29:35.648 --> 29:36.691
a lot of saturation,

29:36.774 --> 29:39.360
{\an1}but the outline
is where you fall short.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.029
{\an1}A lot of your little thin lines
are kind of scratchy,

29:41.112 --> 29:42.530
{\an1}and a lot of your bolder lines
are inconsistent.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.157
- Bold lines went
around the head

29:44.240 --> 29:47.702
and around to the front of those
wings, popped them forward.

29:47.785 --> 29:48.786
{\an1}- But they didn't.
It only went on one wing.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.830
{\an1}The other wing doesn't
have the bold line.

29:50.914 --> 29:54.042
{\an1}It looks like you bold up
areas that you needed to fix.

29:54.125 --> 29:54.792
{\an3}- Ollie, let me ask you
a question.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.836
- Yeah.
- Does it look like

29:56.920 --> 29:59.088
{\an3}the inside parts of the wing
should be on the outside?

29:59.172 --> 30:00.381
Shouldn't they be reversed?

30:00.465 --> 30:02.717
{\an1}Typically when you do a wing,
it comes off and comes out.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.302
{\an1}You have your first tier,
your second tier,

30:04.385 --> 30:05.720
and your third tier,

30:05.803 --> 30:07.722
{\an1}and then it tiers back
in towards the body.

30:07.805 --> 30:08.765
It's kind of weird right there.

30:08.848 --> 30:12.060
It should be reversed.
- Exactly.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.269
{\an3}You did better
than the first one,

30:13.353 --> 30:15.021
{\an3}but you definitely have
some complications in this one.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.028
- Kruseman.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.489
{\an7}- First thing I'm gonna
say about your first tattoo--

30:24.572 --> 30:27.617
{\an8}just did not meet the challenge.

30:27.700 --> 30:30.411
{\an1}This tattoo,
100% carousel horse,

30:30.495 --> 30:32.705
{\an1}and it really pulls off
the effect of stained-glass.

30:32.789 --> 30:33.873
Where your blacks
come off the line,

30:33.957 --> 30:36.000
it's black to the line,
just those little areas,

30:36.084 --> 30:39.045
{\an1}and it really helps give the
strength to the shading in here,

30:39.128 --> 30:41.256
{\an1}and the color is saturated
to the line.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.924
- I purposely thought about that
when I was doing that tattoo.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.635
{\an3}- My favorite part of
the whole tattoo is the saddle.

30:45.718 --> 30:46.928
The way that that aqua

30:47.011 --> 30:49.013
plays off the black really
worked to your advantage.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.140
{\an3}The line weight and the black
and the density of the way

30:51.224 --> 30:55.603
{\an3}that you put the panes together
makes the image look heavy.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.105
You completely came back

30:57.188 --> 30:59.566
{\an3}and delivered what it was that
you should've delivered day one.

31:03.194 --> 31:06.990
- Craig.

31:07.073 --> 31:10.451
{\an7}- One of the biggest problems
with your previous Neptune

31:10.535 --> 31:12.036
{\an7}was definitely design elements
not flowing together.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.456
{\an1}You definitely made a better
design choice this time.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.833
{\an1}Overall, man, you got a lot of
nice fine details in the cracks,

31:16.916 --> 31:19.836
{\an1}making this thing
really look like a statue.

31:19.919 --> 31:21.546
But then when it comes
to the eyes, the nose,

31:21.629 --> 31:23.965
{\an1}and the mouth,
the detail is gone.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.968
{\an1}I almost wish that you would've
just done a simpler face

31:27.051 --> 31:28.886
{\an1}and had some cracks
running across it, just

31:28.970 --> 31:29.804
give it that statuesque look,

31:29.887 --> 31:33.141
instead of losing me
with the messy face.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.726
- Everything in the composition

31:34.809 --> 31:36.811
{\an3}of the actual statue
itself is great.

31:36.894 --> 31:38.605
{\an3}It's just very tonal
and very dark.

31:38.688 --> 31:41.024
You did an amazing drawing,

31:41.107 --> 31:43.943
{\an3}but then you really went in
and just muddied it up.

31:49.115 --> 31:50.158
- All right, guys, do we have
a best tattoo of the day?

31:50.241 --> 31:53.995
{\an1}- The least flawed of the three
I think is Kruseman.

31:54.078 --> 31:55.705
Really has that effect of light

31:55.788 --> 31:58.207
{\an1}shining through the glass, great
color play, great line work,

31:58.291 --> 31:59.667
and really shown on this tattoo

31:59.751 --> 32:01.669
{\an1}that we haven't
seen him do so far.

32:01.753 --> 32:02.253
- Going with Kruseman.

32:02.337 --> 32:05.673
{\an3}- Kruseman.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.926
- The judges have decided
the best tattoo of the day

32:09.010 --> 32:10.053
goes to Kruseman.

32:10.136 --> 32:12.847
Congratulations, man.
- Feels awesome, man.

32:12.930 --> 32:14.932
That's my first tattoo of the
day for this whole competition.

32:15.016 --> 32:18.019
- Not only is it
the best tattoo of the day,

32:18.102 --> 32:20.146
but you've earned your spot
in the live finale.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.864
- Thank you.

32:29.947 --> 32:31.032
- Craig and Chris,
two of you remain,

32:31.115 --> 32:35.536
but there's only one spot
left in the live finale.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.122
Based on these tattoos,

32:38.206 --> 32:41.834
one of you is
about to close shop right now.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.961
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

32:48.841 --> 32:51.052
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

32:51.135 --> 32:54.055
- Chris and Craig,
based on these tattoos,

32:54.138 --> 32:57.850
one of you will not be going
to the live finale.

32:57.934 --> 32:58.893
{\an1}- Chris, first look
at this tattoo,

32:58.976 --> 33:01.270
{\an1}it comes off
very bright, very colorful,

33:01.354 --> 33:03.231
{\an1}but as you get in and inspect it
from a technical standpoint,

33:03.314 --> 33:07.068
{\an1}the little areas of white
don't really hold that strong.

33:07.151 --> 33:09.195
{\an1}I just don't know
what the purpose of it is.

33:09.278 --> 33:10.655
- You've been tattooing
a long time, Oliver.

33:10.738 --> 33:13.032
You know that it's gonna
lighten that part.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.575
You know,
let's be genuine and realistic

33:14.659 --> 33:15.660
with our critiques here today.

33:15.743 --> 33:16.744
Putting highlights
in certain areas, obviously,

33:16.828 --> 33:17.912
is to lighten certain areas.

33:17.995 --> 33:20.373
- Chris, do you feel that
the critiques are ingenuine?

33:20.456 --> 33:22.375
- Sometimes.

33:22.458 --> 33:25.002
- Maybe we have it wrong
to have you here.

33:26.462 --> 33:27.588
- Dave, you don't have
to go like that,

33:27.672 --> 33:28.923
and that's not
what I'm trying to say.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.883
- Well, that's what it's
sounding like to us up here.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.009
Oliver, explain your thoughts.

33:32.093 --> 33:35.888
{\an1}- Chris, that light effect
can be easily achieved

33:35.972 --> 33:36.681
and a better healed
tattoo if you just

33:36.764 --> 33:40.184
leave a little bit of skin,

33:40.268 --> 33:41.144
and years from now,

33:41.227 --> 33:43.396
{\an1}that little bit
of skin is gonna ring true,

33:43.479 --> 33:45.189
{\an1}and it's gonna be
a more solid tattoo.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.441
- Pretty much just
kicked ass all the way

33:46.524 --> 33:47.650
through the whole competition.

33:47.734 --> 33:50.111
I didn't change my style to,

33:50.194 --> 33:52.321
you know,
get through the competition.

33:52.405 --> 33:54.741
I didn't change it from if
I wasn't having a good time

33:54.824 --> 33:56.033
with color by doing black
and gray or any crap like that.

33:56.117 --> 33:59.787
It just bums me out
that we got to the final bit,

33:59.871 --> 34:00.997
and the final bit
was little things.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.708
{\an3}- But you have two wings
that are on backwards.

34:05.376 --> 34:06.919
{\an3}That's what
shakes things up here.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.004
If the wings are on perfectly,

34:08.087 --> 34:11.257
{\an3}then we have a much
clearer cut decision.

34:11.340 --> 34:13.801
{\an3}It's hard looking at something
that isn't drawn properly.

34:15.094 --> 34:15.969
- Craig.
- Craig,

34:16.053 --> 34:17.304
{\an3}your drawing
is a beautiful drawing.

34:17.388 --> 34:20.766
{\an3}The hand holding the lightning
is great, but that arm

34:20.850 --> 34:23.101
{\an3}just literally blends right back
into that pillar.

34:23.186 --> 34:26.063
{\an3}You're just so tonal
in so many places in this.

34:26.147 --> 34:27.815
- I was trying to keep
the whole statue way

34:27.899 --> 34:30.234
lighter than the stones
behind it.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.402
- You got to pick a place
that the light comes from,

34:32.487 --> 34:33.654
{\an3}and you got to commit
to those motions.

34:33.737 --> 34:37.283
{\an3}Those are the concepts that
you really got to hold on to,

34:37.366 --> 34:39.118
and that would change this look.

34:39.202 --> 34:42.205
- Both of you guys
show strengths and weaknesses

34:42.288 --> 34:43.998
in your tattoos.
- You guys are men.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.833
{\an3}You're not machines,
but in this competition,

34:45.917 --> 34:48.543
{\an3}the strongest horse
wins the race.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.130
- One of you is headed
to the live finale,

34:51.214 --> 34:54.175
and one of you is about
to close shop right now.

34:54.257 --> 34:57.178
<i>[tense rock music]</i>

34:57.261 --> 34:58.846
The judges have decided...

35:01.265 --> 35:06.437
Chris, you are headed
to the live finale.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.855
Congratulations.
- Yes.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.273
- Damn.
- Thank you, guys.

35:09.357 --> 35:14.278
- Craig, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.531
{\an1}- It's a tough one, man.
It's a tough decision.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.532
Your strengths are so strong.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.868
{\an1}Unfortunately, man,
you tripped a little bit,

35:20.952 --> 35:22.370
and you just couldn't
get your footing back.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.538
- It's been a good trip.

35:23.621 --> 35:24.831
The last time that I was here,

35:24.914 --> 35:27.291
the leading was more confusing.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.417
This time, I understand it.

35:28.501 --> 35:31.379
{\an3}- I respect the [bleep] out
of you for coming back

35:31.462 --> 35:33.840
and doing it again, and you know
you're welcome back in this room

35:33.923 --> 35:35.633
any time you want to come in.

35:35.716 --> 35:36.717
- Please pack your machines
and close shop.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.804
- Cheers, you guys.

35:45.059 --> 35:46.644
I showed up, never gave up.

35:46.727 --> 35:48.104
I wanted to see
what I could do,

35:48.187 --> 35:50.940
'cause I really felt like I did
not finish the last time I came,

35:51.023 --> 35:51.899
and now I feel
like I've finished.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.860
<i>Didn't work out perfectly,</i>

35:53.943 --> 35:55.194
but at the end, I'm satisfied.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.408
- Congratulations, Chris.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.785
Your headed to the live finale
to compete

36:02.869 --> 36:03.744
against Matt and Kruseman.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.330
Prepare to meet
your master canvases.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.592
Congratulations.

36:17.675 --> 36:21.053
The three of you have earned
your spot in the live finale.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.597
- Heck yes.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.308
{\an3}- You are all
incredibly strong artists,

36:25.391 --> 36:28.436
{\an3}but only one of you
can walk away with $100,000,

36:28.519 --> 36:30.479
a feature in "Inked" magazine,

36:30.563 --> 36:31.439
and the title of Ink Master.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.192
For your final tattoo,

36:34.275 --> 36:37.153
{\an3}you will each be assigned
a master canvas.

36:37.236 --> 36:40.448
{\an3}You will have a total
of 35 hours

36:40.531 --> 36:42.950
{\an3}over the next several months
at home to create a back piece.

36:43.034 --> 36:46.287
- Wow.
- The style and subject

36:46.370 --> 36:47.914
of your back piece...

36:47.997 --> 36:52.376
Are completely up to you.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.461
- Yes.
I've been told

36:53.544 --> 36:55.129
{\an8}what I have to do
this entire competition.

36:55.212 --> 36:58.466
{\an8}Now I finally get to do
my own thing.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.344
- But that's not all.
- Oh, man.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.095
{\an3}- To earn the title
of Ink Master,

37:03.179 --> 37:06.307
{\an3}you must also impress
all of America.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.268
- What?
- In addition to your 35 hour

37:09.352 --> 37:10.311
back piece, at the finale,

37:10.394 --> 37:15.149
all of you must create
a six-hour tattoo live

37:15.232 --> 37:17.109
in the style America chooses.

37:17.193 --> 37:19.445
- Oh, man.
- What?

37:19.528 --> 37:22.073
{\an3}- All season long, America
has been examining your work.

37:22.156 --> 37:25.326
Now it's their turn
to assign the style

37:25.409 --> 37:26.994
{\an3}that you must nail
to earn the title of Ink Master.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.455
During the finale, America

37:29.538 --> 37:32.792
{\an3}will vote on which artist
has the best six-hour tattoo.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.168
Win America's vote,

37:34.251 --> 37:38.047
{\an3}and you will earn your spot
in the final two.

37:38.130 --> 37:41.509
The tattoo America assigns
gets you to the final two.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.010
The title of Ink Master

37:43.094 --> 37:45.638
{\an3}will be awarded based
on your 35-hour back piece.

37:45.721 --> 37:50.685
- This is a great time to put
any assumptions of what you can

37:50.768 --> 37:54.063
or cannot do aside
and really bring it.

37:55.272 --> 37:57.024
{\an3}- Let's meet
your master canvases.

38:01.988 --> 38:05.241
Matt, meet Shelby.

38:05.324 --> 38:09.161
{\an3}Kruseman,
your master canvas is Kyle.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.330
Chris, meet Tara.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.415
Your master canvases
are completely open.

38:15.751 --> 38:20.715
{\an3}This tattoo stands between
you and $100,000,

38:20.798 --> 38:23.217
{\an3}so make sure
you pull out all the stops

38:23.300 --> 38:25.386
{\an3}and create the best work
of your career.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.679
You have the rest of the evening

38:26.762 --> 38:27.221
{\an3}to consult
with your master canvases.

38:27.304 --> 38:29.181
Your first session

38:29.265 --> 38:32.184
{\an3}will be in your hometown
in just a few weeks.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.520
{\an3}Then you'll return
to New York City

38:34.603 --> 38:37.023
{\an3}to battle it out live
for America's votes

38:37.106 --> 38:39.483
and reveal your master canvas.

38:39.567 --> 38:43.654
{\an3}Safe travels, and we'll see you
at the live finale.

38:43.738 --> 38:44.822
- Good to meet you.
- Hi, Kruseman, come on over.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.824
- Right up there.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.701
{\an8}- This is gonna
be the most intense tattoo

38:48.784 --> 38:50.578
{\an8}these three artists
have ever done.

38:50.661 --> 38:52.079
- I'm the realistic
and portrait and pin-up guy.

38:52.163 --> 38:55.249
- This has to be
the $100,000 tattoo.

38:55.332 --> 38:59.420
- I've had some cool ideas
as far as, like,

38:59.503 --> 39:00.755
animal-related stuff.

39:00.838 --> 39:02.631
I'm the strongest artist
in this competition.

39:02.715 --> 39:03.924
I know I've got what it takes
to knock these guys out

39:04.008 --> 39:07.595
and win the $100,000.

39:07.678 --> 39:11.140
- You do whatever you would
think will win you that 100,000.

39:11.223 --> 39:13.392
- Awesome.
- I'm up for anything.

39:13.476 --> 39:14.435
- Awesome.

39:14.518 --> 39:14.935
- So this is where I want to go.

39:15.019 --> 39:15.853
Pin-up style.

39:15.936 --> 39:19.607
- Wow, hell yeah.

39:19.690 --> 39:20.941
{\an8}- I barely made it
into the finale.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.277
{\an8}You're gonna see me fight harder
than I've ever fought before.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.696
I only have one mission
to accomplish.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.323
It's not finished yet,
and I won't stop till it is.

39:27.406 --> 39:29.575
- I'm so glad
we're on the same page.

39:29.658 --> 39:30.367
both: Yes.
- It's definitely

39:30.451 --> 39:31.577
gonna be color.
- Yeah.

39:31.660 --> 39:34.288
- It's definitely gonna be
the traditional style.

39:34.371 --> 39:36.791
{\an8}I am so stoked to do
a traditional back piece.

39:36.874 --> 39:40.753
This is my one chance to show
what a Dave Kruseman tattoo is.

39:40.836 --> 39:43.089
- Awesome.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.632
- This is my title.

39:44.715 --> 39:47.134
You might as well call me the
master and them the apprentices.

39:48.552 --> 39:50.137
- I feel like I've bled
to get here.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.556
I feel like I swam through
rivers of [bleep] to get here.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.434
There is no way on
God's given Earth at this point

39:55.518 --> 39:57.311
that I'm giving up.

39:57.394 --> 39:59.313
- The only mission I have is
to win the title of Ink Master

39:59.396 --> 40:00.773
and win the $100,000.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.233
It's so close, I can taste it.

40:02.316 --> 40:02.525
I can feel it.

40:07.029 --> 40:08.405
- All right, fellas.
- Y'all ready for this?

40:08.489 --> 40:09.949
- Yup, this is what's gonna
separate the men

40:10.032 --> 40:12.243
from the boys, for sure.

40:12.326 --> 40:14.495
- Let's get to it.
- Good luck, you guys.

40:14.578 --> 40:15.579
You're gonna need it.

40:15.663 --> 40:16.664
- I'll kick your guys' ass.

40:16.747 --> 40:17.748
- Nobody's scared of you.

40:20.417 --> 40:23.504
<i>announcer: On the live season</i>
