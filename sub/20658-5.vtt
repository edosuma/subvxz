WEBVTT

00:11.512 --> 00:13.814
So I was like, "You can't

00:13.847 --> 00:17.051
"Gone Girl" someone if you say
you're "Gone Girl"-ing him."

00:17.085 --> 00:18.486
Yeah, that is too true.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.421
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.555
To girls night.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.257
Girls night.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.592
No rush, ladies.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.726
Just whenever you get a chance.

00:25.759 --> 00:26.860
Thanks.

00:26.894 --> 00:29.330
Here, let me get it, because
I did just get a raise.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.198
Thanks, Emily.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.365
How much should I tip?

00:31.399 --> 00:33.201
In a perfect world, nothing.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.103
(dishes shatter)
Oh, sorry.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.337
Why are you here?

00:36.370 --> 00:37.738
I eat here all the time.

00:37.771 --> 00:40.208
Were you eating dinner
with a plant?

00:40.241 --> 00:41.775
Of course not.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.344
Happy to join you.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.745
Hi, I'm Adam.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.848
Adam, these are my friends,
"Go Away" and "You Don't Need To

00:47.881 --> 00:49.016
Know." Now scram.

00:49.049 --> 00:49.950
It's okay.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.785
Hi, I'm Veronica and this is
Haylie.

00:51.819 --> 00:52.520
No. No, no, no.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.554
Don't be nice to him.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.390
He's just going to destroy
something we love.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.625
Oh, God.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.760
It's restaurants, isn't it?

00:59.793 --> 01:01.929
No, I love restaurants.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.164
Oh, God, phew.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.933
But you must admit that some
restaurant customs are pretty

01:05.966 --> 01:07.135
weird.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.402
No.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.271
♪♪
Ugh, why would anyone give

01:19.079 --> 01:20.481
you a TV show?

01:20.514 --> 01:21.815
Because I'm so handsome?

01:21.849 --> 01:22.783
Oh, honey.

01:22.816 --> 01:23.951
That can't be why.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.953
Okay, so you don't like
tipping.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.321
Oh, no, not at all.

01:27.355 --> 01:30.824
And I understand that right now,
you probably hate me for even

01:30.858 --> 01:32.760
daring to question the custom.

01:32.793 --> 01:33.994
Yeah, what the fudge?

01:34.027 --> 01:35.429
Oh, sorry.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.630
But hear me out.

01:36.664 --> 01:39.133
By the time I'm done, I think
you'll agree that tipping is a

01:39.167 --> 01:41.902
custom we'd be better off
without.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.137
Sorry.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.572
I don't tip.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.807
I'm not gonna tip just 'cause
society says I got to.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.677
Let's get one thing straight,
if you live in America, you have

01:49.710 --> 01:50.944
to tip.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.681
Restaurants here can legally pay
their servers less than minimum

01:53.714 --> 01:54.448
wage.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.184
As little as three bucks an
hour.

01:56.217 --> 02:00.588
As long as that's true, if you
don't tip, you're a bad person.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.356
I'm getting out of here.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.524
Jerk.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.993
But just because that's the
system we have, doesn't mean

02:06.026 --> 02:08.662
it's a good system, and
restaurant tipping is a custom

02:08.696 --> 02:11.599
that shortchanges servers,
inconveniences customers, and

02:11.632 --> 02:14.535
makes the dining experience
worse for everyone.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.370
Oh, sorry.

02:16.404 --> 02:20.040
First, ask yourself this--
why is it our responsibility to

02:20.073 --> 02:22.843
pay the restaurant's employees
fairly?

02:22.876 --> 02:25.779
Like, why don't they just pay
you a normal amount of money and

02:25.813 --> 02:27.648
make the food more expensive?

02:27.681 --> 02:30.818
That's what every business has
done since the dawn of time.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.886
When you buy a shirt, it's just
50 bucks.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.957
They're not like, okay, that'll
be $40, and you decide the stock

02:36.990 --> 02:38.226
boy eats tonight.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.827
Oh, wow.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.329
Guess you're going hungry.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.063
No, it's his fault, not mine.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.032
Bogus.

02:45.065 --> 02:48.369
In most countries, restaurant
tipping isn't mandatory and even

02:48.402 --> 02:50.738
in America, it's a relatively
new custom.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.674
For most of our history, tipping
was considered an undemocratic

02:53.707 --> 02:54.975
form of bribery.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.411
Serve me before this rabble,
won't you?

02:57.445 --> 02:59.313
I'm a very wealthy man.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.914
I shan't, sir.

03:00.948 --> 03:06.520
This is America, where every man
has the right to decent service.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.189
But after prohibition banned
the sale of alcohol, restaurant

03:09.223 --> 03:11.659
profits cratered,
and restaurant owners started

03:11.692 --> 03:14.328
encouraging servers to accept
tips because it meant they could

03:14.362 --> 03:15.396
pay them less.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.597
Sorry, Ollie.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.766
I can't afford to pay you this
month.

03:18.799 --> 03:22.102
You better go take that fat
cat's cash.

03:22.135 --> 03:25.773
A century later, we're still
stuck with the same system,

03:25.806 --> 03:29.443
turning what used to be a bribe
into an obligation that makes

03:29.477 --> 03:32.746
the end of every meal suck,
unless your idea of a good time

03:32.780 --> 03:34.948
is bickering with your friends
about math.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.784
Just tip 15%.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.452
15?

03:38.486 --> 03:41.289
Clearly, you've never worked in
the service industry.

03:41.322 --> 03:44.458
I always tip at least 60.

03:44.492 --> 03:47.227
Guys, everyone knows the rule
is 20%, so I'm just gonna tip

03:47.261 --> 03:48.429
that, problem solved.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.563
Okay.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.765
If you think the rule is so
clear, let me ask you this.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.768
20% before or after tax?

03:54.802 --> 03:56.103
Before.

03:56.136 --> 03:56.870
After.

03:56.904 --> 03:57.805
Ugh...

03:57.838 --> 03:58.739
I like it.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.941
If I give better service, I earn
better tips.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.443
Actually, you don't.

04:02.476 --> 04:06.246
Research shows that only 2% of
the difference in tips left by

04:06.280 --> 04:08.882
different parties is explainable
by the quality and service.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.919
In other words, no matter how
good of a job you do, you'll be

04:11.952 --> 04:13.454
tipped about the same.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.254
Seriously?

04:14.288 --> 04:16.824
Well, then screw this.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.992
Yep.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.894
Should we not tip him?

04:20.928 --> 04:23.230
No, I don't want to get
yelled at.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.499
Just give him... 18%.

04:25.533 --> 04:28.802
And the worst part is,
tipping results in wage

04:28.836 --> 04:29.970
discrimination.

04:30.003 --> 04:33.173
The research also shows that
black servers are tipped less

04:33.206 --> 04:35.943
than white servers across the
board.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.646
Um, I think I forgot
something.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.648
Uh, just...

04:42.049 --> 04:44.184
I'll get that.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.853
Oh.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.087
I feel bad.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.289
And considering that racially
discriminatory pay is against

04:49.323 --> 04:52.460
the law, it's kind of surprising
that this entire system isn't

04:52.493 --> 04:53.994
straight up illegal.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.195
Oh, my God.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.765
Okay, that's terrible, but
what can we do about it?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.967
I mean, we can't change the
restaurant industry.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.270
No, but restaurants can and
some already are.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.040
Meet Gabriel Frem and Christy
Kuriakose from Brand 158 in

05:07.074 --> 05:08.542
Glendale, California.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.277
Gabriel, would you tell these
guys a little bit about your

05:10.310 --> 05:10.978
restaurant?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.179
Sure.

05:12.212 --> 05:15.282
At Brand 158, we instituted a
no-tipping policy, and that's

05:15.315 --> 05:16.684
been a great success.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.952
For our guests, they feel like
they're in a nurturing

05:18.986 --> 05:21.221
environment where they can
relax, enjoy their meal, and not

05:21.254 --> 05:24.024
have to worry about doing math
at the end of the meal to figure

05:24.057 --> 05:25.258
out what to tip.

05:25.292 --> 05:28.295
And for our servers, it creates
stable income so that they can

05:28.328 --> 05:29.563
focus on our guests.

05:29.597 --> 05:32.299
We don't do it because we feel
charitable, we do it because

05:32.332 --> 05:34.735
it's good business to take care
of your people so that they can

05:34.768 --> 05:37.070
take care of your customers like
any other business.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.972
But what does the staff
think?

05:39.006 --> 05:41.141
Oh, the employees love it,
let me tell you.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.311
As a server, the fact that I
have a stable income is

05:44.344 --> 05:45.513
absolutely fantastic.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.314
I even have benefits.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.749
Are you hiring?

05:48.782 --> 05:51.519
We're always looking for good
people.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.087
That does sound like a better
system.

05:54.121 --> 05:57.224
It is, but until the rest of
the restaurants catch up,

05:57.257 --> 05:58.726
you still have to tip.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.094
So, uh, pay up.

06:01.128 --> 06:05.433
Your friend is super fun,
Emily.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.267
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.569
I need a drink.

06:08.602 --> 06:13.040
♪ Show me your moonlight
Yay! Taking a shot!

06:13.073 --> 06:14.374
Oh, Jagermeister.

06:14.408 --> 06:18.779
Named after Hermann Goring's
huntmasters, or "Jagermeisters"

06:18.812 --> 06:20.347
of the Nazi era.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.550
What the hell?

06:22.583 --> 06:24.518
You're going to ruin our
drinks for us?

06:24.552 --> 06:27.688
You know, my ride share is
almost here, but what the heck,

06:27.721 --> 06:29.490
I'll cancel it.

06:34.662 --> 06:38.766
♪♪
What can I get you ladies?

06:38.799 --> 06:41.301
Well, I really like
craft beer.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.704
Something super artisanal.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.906
Maybe like a Goose Stop.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.241
You mean a Miller Bud?

06:48.275 --> 06:49.610
No, Goose Stop.

06:49.643 --> 06:50.544
Miller Bud.

06:50.578 --> 06:51.211
Goose Stop!

06:51.244 --> 06:52.312
Miller Bud!

06:52.345 --> 06:54.548
Look, I don't know what you
think "craft beer" means.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.617
It means it comes with an
orange slice.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.086
But many of the most popular
craft beers are actually brewed

06:59.119 --> 07:01.321
by giant corporations.

07:01.354 --> 07:04.992
The term is totally unregulated
and can be used by anyone.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.226
Whatever.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.161
I want a real drink.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.730
A whiskey.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.998
How about that one?

07:11.031 --> 07:14.602
The bottle is way old, there's a
cabin on the label, and it's $15

07:14.635 --> 07:16.269
a glass, so you know it's good.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.237
You got it.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.405
Oh, excuse me.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.507
Excuse me, excuse me.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.908
Excuse me, excuse me.

07:20.941 --> 07:21.742
Here we go.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.976
No, the fancy one!

07:23.010 --> 07:24.277
But what's the difference?

07:24.311 --> 07:25.479
It's the same whiskey.

07:25.513 --> 07:28.849
Many supposedly "small batch"
bourbons and ryes are just the

07:28.882 --> 07:32.520
same liquor slightly changed
with a cooler label.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.688
Time for a refill.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.724
(cackling)
All right, ladies, would you

07:41.161 --> 07:42.262
like to see our wine list?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.397
That sounds perfect.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.868
Yes, let's talk about wine.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.136
There are so many.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.370
How am I supposed to choose?

07:50.403 --> 07:52.372
Have you ever noticed that
when it's time to choose a wine,

07:52.405 --> 07:54.675
none of us feel like we know
what we're doing?

07:54.708 --> 07:56.810
This one's fancy, I think.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.379
Since we can't taste the
wines before we buy them, we're

07:59.412 --> 08:01.715
forced to pick just based on the
label.

08:01.749 --> 08:05.686
This one has a frog wearing a
hat, so I bet that tastes

08:05.719 --> 08:08.388
like... mossy?

08:08.421 --> 08:10.858
This one's by Francis Ford
Coppola.

08:10.891 --> 08:14.361
I like his movies, so I bet it
tastes like, um, "The

08:14.394 --> 08:15.729
Godfather"?

08:15.763 --> 08:17.230
This one says ketchup.

08:17.264 --> 08:20.568
Am I holding a bottle of
ketchup?

08:20.601 --> 08:23.804
And even when we do taste
them, we doubt our own opinions.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.673
Mmm, this is dry.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.008
This one's full... bodied?

08:28.041 --> 08:28.976
Are you sure?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.243
No, what is a wine body?

08:30.277 --> 08:31.812
Yeah, this is clearly wet.

08:31.845 --> 08:36.083
So we defer to the opinions
of so-called "wine experts."

08:36.116 --> 08:39.352
Perhaps I can be of some
assistance, ladies.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.854
Oh, thank God.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.089
Tell us what tastes good.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.924
I've been pretending this
whole time.

08:43.957 --> 08:47.695
But the truth is, everyone is
pretending because even though

08:47.728 --> 08:50.397
wine connoisseurs want us to
believe that their ratings are

08:50.430 --> 08:51.599
objective...

08:51.632 --> 08:55.535
That one's fit to drink,
that is cheap swill, and that is

08:55.569 --> 08:56.737
a bottle of ketchup.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.506
...and they have supernatural
powers of wine discernment.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.341
Hmm, a 1934.

09:01.374 --> 09:05.112
Tastes like it was a very cold
summer that year.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.614
And, uh...

09:06.647 --> 09:08.081
the vendor's wife was pregnant.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.817
Hold on.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.419
With a girl.

09:12.452 --> 09:15.288
Here's the big secret--
wine experts can't tell the

09:15.322 --> 09:16.356
difference either.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.925
I beg to differ, sir.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.127
My palate is incredibly refined.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.396
Well, Frederic Brochet of the
University of Bordeaux would say

09:23.430 --> 09:24.598
otherwise.

09:24.632 --> 09:27.635
He conducted a series of tests
on unsuspecting wine experts,

09:27.668 --> 09:30.971
but for the sake of TV, let's
call them wine pranks.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.472
Wine pranks!

09:32.505 --> 09:35.408
In the first test, 54 wine
connoisseurs were asked to

09:35.442 --> 09:37.277
compare a red and a white wine.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.411
Should be pretty easy.

09:38.445 --> 09:42.049
The red is juicy and robust.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.618
The white...

09:44.652 --> 09:47.821
It's bright, with notes of
vanilla and oak.

09:47.855 --> 09:48.922
Wrong!

09:48.956 --> 09:51.058
They're actually the same wine.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.393
(buzzer)
Half of the bottles were just

09:53.426 --> 09:56.830
white wine dyed red and none of
the participants could tell.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.331
I never!

09:58.365 --> 10:00.000
Wine pranks!

10:00.033 --> 10:03.136
In another test, experts were
asked to compare two different

10:03.170 --> 10:04.271
bottles.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.140
One, an expensive Grand Cru,
and the other, a cheap table

10:07.174 --> 10:08.175
wine.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.509
The Grand Cru.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.610
Complex.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.813
Very, very interesting.

10:12.846 --> 10:16.249
I shall be returning to the
Grand Cru.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.919
(farts)
"Fan-du-tab."

10:18.952 --> 10:19.853
It's light.

10:19.887 --> 10:20.688
It's flat.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.355
It's pretty much what you'd
expect.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.524
Oh, that's interesting,
because once again, they're the

10:24.557 --> 10:26.593
same wine.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.863
Brochet just put the same wine
in two different bottles and

10:29.897 --> 10:33.033
none of the so-called "wine
experts" even noticed.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.668
Wine pranks, wine pranks!

10:34.702 --> 10:37.537
Oh, you got wine pranked!

10:37.570 --> 10:38.371
All right.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.940
You've convinced me.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.209
All wine is terrible and it
tastes the same.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.645
No, wine is wonderful and of
course, wines taste different.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.215
It's just totally subjective,
like all foods.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.719
We don't need sandwich experts
because we know what we like.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.121
Peanut butter and sardines.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.023
What, they're both healthy fats.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.524
And it's what I like.

10:57.557 --> 11:00.360
If you don't like it, it doesn't
matter because there's no

11:00.393 --> 11:02.863
objective truth to what tastes
best.

11:02.896 --> 11:06.066
We think of wine as a high-class
item only accessible by

11:06.099 --> 11:08.635
high-class people,
but it's just tasty fermented

11:08.668 --> 11:09.837
grapes.

11:09.870 --> 11:10.871
So you know what?

11:10.904 --> 11:13.140
Forget the snobs,
take risks and drink what tastes

11:13.173 --> 11:14.207
good to you.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.675
Wait. Really?

11:15.709 --> 11:17.745
You mean I can drink whatever I
want?

11:17.778 --> 11:18.812
Yeah.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.748
Freedom!

11:21.949 --> 11:25.152
Who wants to split a box of
white zin?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.120
Yeah!

11:28.621 --> 11:30.690
I've missed this so much!

11:30.724 --> 11:32.726
I love it!

11:36.396 --> 11:38.431
Great. So...

11:38.465 --> 11:41.101
Thank you for an enlightening
time.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.269
I think we've all learned a lot.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.336
Yeah.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.604
Sorry you missed dinner.

11:44.637 --> 11:47.707
You know, it's time to split, so
enjoy your sandwich that you

11:47.741 --> 11:48.675
brought to a restaurant.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.343
Oh, what'd you guys have, by
the way?

11:50.377 --> 11:51.411
We all had the fish.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.713
I had the orange roughy,
Emily had the salmon, and

11:53.747 --> 11:55.615
Veronica had the white tuna,
okay?

11:55.648 --> 11:57.584
Oh.

11:57.617 --> 11:58.886
What?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.553
You don't really want to
know.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.455
At this point, just lay it on
me.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.724
Okay, first, I want to finish
my sandwich.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.659
Oh, my God.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.901
♪♪
Did you know that lobster was

12:16.904 --> 12:19.039
originally considered food for
the poor?

12:19.072 --> 12:22.375
It didn't become associated with
wealth and luxury until World

12:22.409 --> 12:25.545
War II, when food rationing
cased shortages--

12:25.578 --> 12:27.714
Ahem. You were supposed to
tell us what's wrong with what

12:27.747 --> 12:29.116
we ordered.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.818
Of course, happy to.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.787
I think it's time we visit the
ghost of dinner past.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.388
Are you talking about farts?

12:35.422 --> 12:36.489
No, time travel.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.125
Everybody hold hands.

12:38.158 --> 12:41.261
And you think, you wink, you do
a double blink...

12:41.294 --> 12:43.196
Just do it.

12:47.634 --> 12:48.768
Is that us?

12:48.802 --> 12:51.471
Yep.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.506
I am so cute.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.810
Hi, I don't have a
reservation.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.445
Table for two, please.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.314
That's not what it looks
like.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.482
No, come on.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.951
Do you have water?

13:03.984 --> 13:05.252
Just a joke.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.519
Excuse me.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.990
You are very pretty.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.791
Uh, they can't see or hear
us.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.026
Aww.

13:13.060 --> 13:16.263
Anyway, the awful truth about
restaurants is that often the

13:16.296 --> 13:19.699
food you order isn't the food
you get, especially when it

13:19.732 --> 13:21.001
comes to seafood.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.669
Yes, I will have the salmon.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.172
Yeah, I love salmon.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.141
Oh, what color do you like
it?

13:28.175 --> 13:30.177
The color that it naturally
is?

13:30.210 --> 13:31.678
In that case, here it is.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.181
Oh, my God, that is so gross.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.617
Nearly all farmed salmon
actually starts out a sickly

13:37.650 --> 13:38.785
gray color.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.688
I just need a change!

13:41.721 --> 13:44.291
In the ocean, wild salmon
turn pink because they eat

13:44.324 --> 13:47.794
krill, but farmed salmon are fed
kibble, made of chicken fat,

13:47.827 --> 13:50.063
soybeans and ground-up feathers.

13:50.097 --> 13:53.901
My diet is ruining my
complexion, but I just can't

13:53.934 --> 13:55.035
stop!

13:55.068 --> 13:58.138
Manufacturers then dye the
fish pink to make it more

13:58.171 --> 14:00.073
appetizing to unwitting
consumers.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.209
I love it!

14:02.242 --> 14:04.878
The funny thing is, salmon
would actually be a lot cheaper

14:04.912 --> 14:08.515
if it weren't dyed, but we just
gotta have pink fish.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.983
No!

14:10.017 --> 14:12.052
I was gonna go to school!

14:12.085 --> 14:13.820
Yuck.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.389
Well, I'll order wild salmon
from now on.

14:16.423 --> 14:20.093
Actually, even when the menu
says wild salmon, a lot of the

14:20.127 --> 14:22.529
time, you're getting farmed
salmon and you just don't know

14:22.562 --> 14:23.763
it.

14:23.796 --> 14:24.764
Fine.

14:24.797 --> 14:25.999
Tuna.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.735
Oh, don't even get me started
on tuna.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.737
No.

14:30.770 --> 14:34.574
I said, don't even get me
started on tuna!

14:34.607 --> 14:36.076
What's wrong with tuna?

14:36.109 --> 14:37.077
It's what I ordered.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.011
I have to know.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.047
Chances are it wasn't tuna.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.749
The mislabeling of fish is
rampant in the restaurant

14:42.782 --> 14:43.951
industry.

14:43.984 --> 14:47.754
A study by Oceana found that 59%
of the tuna they genetically

14:47.787 --> 14:51.024
tested from grocery stores and
restaurants wasn't tuna at all.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.094
In sushi restaurants, the number
was 74%.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.128
Oh, God.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.296
What is it?

14:56.329 --> 14:57.430
Is it little bugs?

14:57.464 --> 14:59.766
No, it's just other kinds of
fish.

14:59.799 --> 15:02.970
Usually, a snake mackerel called
"escolar."

15:03.003 --> 15:05.305
Well, whatever, so long as it
tastes good.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.140
Oh, yeah, escolar tastes
great.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.409
And you'll be fine, for a few
hours.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.545
But the flesh of escolar
contains waxy deposits that are

15:12.579 --> 15:14.814
not easy to digest.

15:14.847 --> 15:17.484
This is so good.

15:17.517 --> 15:21.754
(stomach gurgling)
I feel so not good.

15:21.788 --> 15:22.789
Ugh.

15:22.822 --> 15:24.891
You'll probably need this.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.459
It makes you poop.

15:26.493 --> 15:27.427
Yeah, we got it.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.628
Okay, how does this happen?

15:28.661 --> 15:30.830
Is it legal?

15:30.863 --> 15:33.566
No, it isn't, but it's pretty
hard to catch the perps when we

15:33.600 --> 15:35.602
keep eating the evidence.

15:36.836 --> 15:40.640
But you know what is legal,
the renaming of "trash fish" to

15:40.673 --> 15:42.242
make them sound more appetizing.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.176
What?

15:43.210 --> 15:44.978
And your orange roughy.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.280
Mmm, sounds tasty.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.648
Oh, yeah, it does.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.651
But it didn't back when the
same fish was called the

15:51.684 --> 15:53.120
"slimehead."

15:53.153 --> 15:54.421
Ugh.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.490
Popular species have been so
depleted that fisherman have

15:57.524 --> 16:00.427
resorted to giving more
appetizing names to weird-ass

16:00.460 --> 16:03.330
fish that used to be considered
too gross to eat.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.831
No tuna today, Chef.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.699
Slimehead is all we got.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.169
I can't serve these
disgusting things!

16:09.202 --> 16:11.671
Even the name makes me want to
hurl.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.940
Well, maybe we can come up
with a new one, then.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.010
Well, they're orange and kind of
rough.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.878
What about orange roughy?

16:18.911 --> 16:19.946
Hmm.

16:19.979 --> 16:24.184
Yes, those dummies should buy
that! Ha!

16:24.217 --> 16:27.354
Kill... me...

16:27.387 --> 16:29.989
(women giggling)
It's true.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.325
Overfishing is a really serious
problem.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.227
Oh, that is so interesting.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.162
Dad?

16:35.195 --> 16:36.729
Wait, this is your dad?

16:36.763 --> 16:38.865
He's so charming.

16:38.898 --> 16:43.002
Yep, this is my actual
father, David Conover, a marine

16:43.036 --> 16:45.238
biologist at Stony Brook
University.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.674
Uh, Dad, these are my best
friends, Emily and the other

16:47.707 --> 16:48.441
ones.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.543
Sorry, we're your best
friends?

16:50.577 --> 16:51.744
You know, we hang out.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.180
That is so sad.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.747
I'm sorry, tell me more.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.050
Let me tell you how bad
overfishing is.

16:57.084 --> 17:01.054
A recent study showed that 58%
of the world's fish docks are

17:01.088 --> 17:02.922
either overfished or collapsed.

17:02.955 --> 17:03.990
Oh, my God.

17:04.023 --> 17:04.857
Okay, Dad.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.159
Can anything be done about this
problem?

17:06.193 --> 17:08.161
Yeah, with respect to
overfishing, we need to reduce

17:08.195 --> 17:10.197
the amount of fish we're
harvesting.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.066
We need to make sure that the
fish species that are being

17:13.100 --> 17:15.935
overharvested are exempt from
harvesting until they recover.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.538
It's all part of what we call
ecosystem-based management.

17:18.571 --> 17:19.506
Wait.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.374
How does that lead to fish
mislabeling, though?

17:21.408 --> 17:24.077
When the most popular fish
are depleted, the fishing

17:24.111 --> 17:26.579
industry has to find new species
to harvest.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.349
There's thousands of fish in the
sea that we serve for food,

17:29.382 --> 17:32.752
but the public knows the names
of only a few of those fish, so

17:32.785 --> 17:35.054
mislabeling is the obvious
result.

17:35.088 --> 17:38.091
Yeah, like anyone could learn
all the names of all those fish.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.893
Well, some of us do know the
names of those fish.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.796
(laughing)
Dad, not everyone loves fish

17:43.830 --> 17:45.532
and wants to marry a fish or
whatever.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.135
Stop embarrassing me!

17:48.168 --> 17:49.702
Sorry, Adam.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.971
See you at Sunday dinner.

17:52.004 --> 17:54.641
Bye, Dad.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.877
Wow, I really liked him.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.979
Like, you could learn
something from him.

18:00.012 --> 18:00.747
Yes.

18:00.780 --> 18:01.948
And he's, like, nice.

18:01.981 --> 18:04.217
Yeah, your dad is super
handsome.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.885
I wouldn't even have known he
was your dad.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.289
It's like, you sound smart,
but he is smart.

18:09.322 --> 18:09.956
You know what?

18:09.989 --> 18:10.823
Let's get dessert.

18:10.857 --> 18:11.691
Yeah!

18:11.724 --> 18:14.161
Oh, you definitely don't want
dessert.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.962
Give me a break, Adam.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.131
What, you don't like drinks, you
don't like dinner, you don't

18:18.165 --> 18:20.933
like dessert, you don't like
restaurants at all, I mean, what

18:20.967 --> 18:22.101
is your glitch?

18:22.135 --> 18:24.003
Look, I know these facts
sound like bummers, but I was

18:24.036 --> 18:27.340
just about to explain how
learning them can actually make

18:27.374 --> 18:31.411
the restaurant experience so
much more--

18:31.444 --> 18:33.413
You truly are a demon.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.515
(whistling)
Okay, so why do you have such

18:41.954 --> 18:43.456
a problem with restaurants?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.792
What, do you hate going to a
nice place, having a nice time?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.328
Oh, no, I love it, and
restaurants can be wonderful.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.664
We just need to remember that
all of this is an illusion.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.601
Haven't you ever wondered where
restaurants come from?

18:54.634 --> 18:55.802
Hmm, nope.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.804
I know cavemen had
drive-thrus.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.839
You're thinking about the
Flintstones, honey.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.642
In France, after the
revolution toppled the

19:02.675 --> 19:05.212
aristocracy,
rich people's personal chefs had

19:05.245 --> 19:08.381
nowhere to work, so they opened
fine dining restaurants so that

19:08.415 --> 19:11.551
even the common man could eat
like a king for a day.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.885
Now, you're not a king.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.020
It's an illusion.

19:14.053 --> 19:16.889
But as long as you don't take
the illusion too seriously

19:16.923 --> 19:20.327
or exploit the people who are
serving you, it's fine.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.396
We just need to all remember
that we created this miniature

19:23.430 --> 19:25.998
world, so we can change it
however we want.

19:26.032 --> 19:29.135
If we leave the bad parts and
keep the good parts, we'll all

19:29.168 --> 19:31.338
have a better time.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.340
So what's your problem
with dessert?

19:33.373 --> 19:34.474
Oh, I love dessert.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.376
I just don't like dessert in
restaurants.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.245
Come on, it's always the same,
like crème brûlée and molten

19:38.278 --> 19:38.911
lava cake.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.480
Let's get ice cream.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.715
This man know stuff.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.051
Yeah, I--
Yeah.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.653
Fun fact about ice cream.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.320
Hey, come on, man.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.988
Give it a rest, you jerk.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.223
Hey, lay off!

19:50.257 --> 19:51.591
How about you give it a rest?

19:51.624 --> 19:53.360
Tuna isn't real.

19:53.393 --> 19:54.494
Okay, hey, calm down.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.095
Hey.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.998
Hey, lay off.

19:59.031 --> 19:59.832
Come on.

19:59.866 --> 20:04.837
What, are we on a playground
here?

20:04.871 --> 20:07.440
Did you know the ice cream
cone was invented in 1904 at the

20:07.474 --> 20:09.242
World's Fair in--
Adam, don't you ever just

20:13.646 --> 20:16.182
stop and enjoy things?

20:16.215 --> 20:19.051
Oh, no, that's how I enjoy
things.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.720
Oh, wow.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.789
A shooting star.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.728
Oh, yeah, that's not a
shooting star.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.763
It's a satellite.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.769
Hey, Emily.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.638
Is Haylie single?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.640
No.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.775
I mean, like, yes, but...

20:42.809 --> 20:44.811
No.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.447
Oh, hey, did you guys valet?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.482
I would love a ride.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.286
Next time on "Adam Ruins
Everything"...

20:53.320 --> 20:55.788
Did you know you just washed
your mouth with floor cleaner?

20:55.822 --> 20:58.291
We'll tell Americans they're
dirty, filthy garbage people.

20:58.325 --> 21:01.294
The massive flimflam that is
the flushable wipe.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.963
And I ate all your old
antidepressants!

21:03.996 --> 21:06.299
(screaming)
