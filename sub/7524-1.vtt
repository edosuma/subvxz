( giggling )

01:51.231 --> 01:53.434
I'm sorry.

01:55.236 --> 02:00.639
I don't know... well, I can't even
remember what got it started, babe.

02:00.641 --> 02:03.077
You're too stubborn, Carter.

02:06.814 --> 02:08.949
- ( barking )
- ( giggling )

02:10.250 --> 02:13.455
Sam, slow down! Watch where you're going.

02:18.191 --> 02:20.160
You said you were gonna
clean up that field.

( sighs )

02:52.792 --> 02:55.529
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

03:04.804 --> 03:06.771
...and so we remember Crayton

03:06.773 --> 03:09.074
for what he accomplished for his family.

03:09.076 --> 03:10.979
<i>A gift that we will treasure.</i>

03:13.713 --> 03:15.080
( camera shutter clicks )

03:15.082 --> 03:17.148
You told Aunt Jane you quit.

03:17.150 --> 03:20.051
Yeah, well, I gave up half
my day to drive you up here,

03:20.053 --> 03:21.920
so let's call it a truce

03:21.922 --> 03:23.921
and go wish your parents a
happy anniversary, okay, Bird?

03:23.923 --> 03:25.991
Don't call me that.

03:25.993 --> 03:29.093
( sighs ) Okay, Isabelle.

03:29.095 --> 03:32.065
Look, why don't we pay
our respects real quick?

03:34.134 --> 03:35.769
I don't want you to come.

03:37.004 --> 03:38.370
Fine,

03:38.372 --> 03:40.808
but leave the camera here with me, okay?

03:42.743 --> 03:45.943
You know, you can't hide
behind that thing forever.

03:45.945 --> 03:48.847
( sighs ) Okay.

03:48.849 --> 03:52.050
Just don't take any
pictures of the service.

03:52.052 --> 03:53.721
Okay.

03:56.189 --> 03:57.324
Here you go.

04:00.026 --> 04:02.129
I'll be right here.

04:04.631 --> 04:07.334
I'm serious about not
taking any pictures, Bird.

04:08.701 --> 04:10.704
Isabelle!

04:27.954 --> 04:29.356
( camera shutter clicks )

04:31.958 --> 04:34.425
Hi.

04:34.427 --> 04:37.230
I've been taking real
good care of your camera.

05:13.199 --> 05:15.266
...in that case,

05:15.268 --> 05:17.002
may we leave here

05:17.004 --> 05:20.471
with but one overarching thought

05:20.473 --> 05:22.206
in our minds...

05:22.208 --> 05:25.110
that Crayton will always...

Oh, my God.

- ( gunshot )
- ( screams ) Okay!

05:54.975 --> 05:56.841
Okay. Please.

I understand it's... it's over,

06:00.013 --> 06:02.514
<i>but... please...</i>

06:02.516 --> 06:04.983
<i>I'm asking you, we
can talk about this.</i>

06:04.985 --> 06:06.817
<i>We can sit down, we can
make some kind of a deal,</i>

06:06.819 --> 06:08.819
<i>just, I'm begging you. I'm
begging you to please...</i>

06:08.821 --> 06:10.824
- <i>just don't...</i>
- Shh.

06:17.797 --> 06:19.434
Take a good look.

06:21.268 --> 06:24.802
- You only get one.
- ( camera shutter clicks )

06:24.804 --> 06:27.172
- I don't know you.
- But you know my employer.

06:27.174 --> 06:30.175
You know you don't challenge
a man in his position.

06:30.177 --> 06:32.480
- Please.
- I've shown you my face.

06:33.881 --> 06:35.913
So you're already dead.

Don't forget your book.

Roger: <i>Isabelle!</i>

08:10.042 --> 08:13.278
- Isabelle!
- Can I help you?

08:13.280 --> 08:15.916
Yeah, I'm looking for a
little girl in a red dress.

08:19.118 --> 08:20.885
Oh.

08:20.887 --> 08:22.419
There's the little angel right now.

Roger! No!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey.

It's okay, it's okay. I can help you.

10:30.650 --> 10:33.183
What happened? Tell me what happened.

Oh, fuck.

11:31.745 --> 11:34.312
Fuck.

11:34.314 --> 11:36.480
Hey, you took some buckshot, did ya?

11:36.482 --> 11:37.617

11:46.193 --> 11:48.629
( whispering ) Psst! Get back. Get back!

12:13.285 --> 12:16.321
- ( gunshot )
- Give it up, mister!

12:16.323 --> 12:17.721
You ain't getting through to me!

12:17.723 --> 12:20.191
Just making sure

12:20.193 --> 12:21.658
- you know your place.
- ( gunshot )

12:21.660 --> 12:24.562
My place? Where's that, huh?

12:24.564 --> 12:26.563
I'm sitting pretty on the high ground

12:26.565 --> 12:29.134
while you waste your clip
burying bullets in the furniture.

12:29.136 --> 12:31.870
<i>That .45 ain't gonna cut a hole
through me and you know it.</i>

12:31.872 --> 12:33.871
<i>Not with that fucking
condom it's wearing.</i>

12:33.873 --> 12:35.308
Well, well, well.

12:37.577 --> 12:39.580
<i>The man knows his guns.</i>

12:46.352 --> 12:48.088
But so do I.

<i>( groans )</i>

13:07.339 --> 13:09.506
( chuckles )

13:09.508 --> 13:11.543
Pitiful range you got

13:11.545 --> 13:14.512
with that candy-ass 20
gauge you're riding up there.

13:14.514 --> 13:18.182
You ain't nothing but a quail hunter, boy.

13:18.184 --> 13:20.621
<i>And I damn sure ain't
no small game, you hear?</i>

13:22.389 --> 13:24.188
You know,

13:24.190 --> 13:26.758
it's still enough to tear
you apart this close, asshole.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.594
Yeah, you're right.

13:29.596 --> 13:31.863
But you know you're gonna need
something a damn sight more substantial

13:31.865 --> 13:35.332
- if you really wanna roughhouse with me.
- I got plenty, buddy.

13:35.334 --> 13:38.836
You just try to come up them
fucking stairs again, okay?!

13:38.838 --> 13:41.739
I will blow your fucking head clean off.

13:41.741 --> 13:44.245
<i>I'm getting the police
on the line right now.</i>

14:02.295 --> 14:03.530
<i>Phone's dead.</i>

14:05.431 --> 14:08.234
<i>Looks like I caught
you at a bad time.</i>

14:12.338 --> 14:15.309
I've got a cell phone, asshole!

14:20.579 --> 14:21.915
I know, dipshit.

14:25.251 --> 14:26.219
I'm looking at it.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.388
- Shit.
- <i>( chuckles )</i>

14:30.390 --> 14:33.557
You really ought to keep
this on you at all times,

14:33.559 --> 14:35.460
you know, for emergencies and such.

14:35.462 --> 14:37.361
I'm just saying.

14:37.363 --> 14:38.830
Hell, it don't matter anyway.

14:38.832 --> 14:40.965
The nearest cop is at least
a half hour away from here

14:40.967 --> 14:43.670
and I won't need but a
few minutes of your time.

14:45.771 --> 14:47.772
You sound like you're selling me something.

14:47.774 --> 14:49.974
Maybe I am, maybe I ain't, friend.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.313
Look, here's the situation.

14:54.347 --> 14:56.847
That adorable little moppet you
got up there, she's seen my face.

14:56.849 --> 14:58.883
Hell, if she was a snake,
she would've bit me.

14:58.885 --> 15:01.619
So if I don't put a hole in her head,

15:01.621 --> 15:03.620
and I mean like right quick,

15:03.622 --> 15:05.690
somebody's gonna do the same
thing to me and I can't allow that.

15:05.692 --> 15:08.025
So what I need you to do is send her down

15:08.027 --> 15:10.827
<i>so I can tidy things up
a bit, you understand?</i>

15:10.829 --> 15:13.063
Yeah, you think she can identify you.

15:13.065 --> 15:16.333
Oh, yes, I know she will,

15:16.335 --> 15:18.036
as quick as a frog can lick flies.

15:18.038 --> 15:19.770
But you, on the other hand,

15:19.772 --> 15:21.572
<i>you didn't see fuck all
except a masked gunman.</i>

15:21.574 --> 15:23.941
I could give less than two shits about you.

15:23.943 --> 15:27.378
All I want's the girl. So why
don't you send her on down here,

15:27.380 --> 15:29.984
<i>let me handle my business,
and I'll be gone.</i>

15:38.692 --> 15:40.857
( sighs ) Look, son,

15:40.859 --> 15:44.595
I understand the, uh, unfortunate

15:44.597 --> 15:47.898
and, uh, complex moral dilemma

15:47.900 --> 15:50.735
<i>that you're facing here.
But it's real simple.</i>

15:50.737 --> 15:53.937
The little lady's seen my face.

15:53.939 --> 15:58.009
<i>Now she's got to pay the
price like everybody else.</i>

15:58.011 --> 16:00.780
That's how it works.

16:02.681 --> 16:05.518
As far as you should be
concerned, she's already dead.

16:07.753 --> 16:10.053
Now, the sooner you allow me

16:10.055 --> 16:12.657
to prove that little point to you,

16:12.659 --> 16:13.890
the sooner you can get back

16:13.892 --> 16:16.661
to your perfect little life here.

16:16.663 --> 16:19.900
- ( groans )
- <i>Now, I know you're bleeding up there.</i>

16:22.035 --> 16:23.768
And that does make time a factor,

16:23.770 --> 16:25.470
so here's what you're gonna do...

16:25.472 --> 16:28.840
you're gonna send the girl down to me.

16:28.842 --> 16:31.642
Get yourself down to a
hospital. Get yourself fixed up.

16:31.644 --> 16:33.543
I'm gonna take care of my
business and that'll be that.

16:33.545 --> 16:34.547
What do you say?

16:36.683 --> 16:38.383
<i>Believe me when I tell you, son,</i>

16:38.385 --> 16:40.851
you do not want to fight me on this thing.

16:40.853 --> 16:44.122
This will only devolve
into a battle of wills

16:44.124 --> 16:46.727
and my will is stronger than
anyone you have ever met.

16:49.828 --> 16:51.162
( sighs )

16:51.164 --> 16:52.433
Yeah?

16:54.501 --> 16:57.501
Well, you and me ain't never
been introduced, asshole.

16:57.503 --> 17:00.637
My name's Carter Greene. This is my house.

17:00.639 --> 17:02.809
Now, so long as I'm still breathing,

17:04.877 --> 17:08.078
you ain't gonna harm a
hair on this child's head.

17:08.079 --> 17:10.448
Listen, you just send the
little lady down here right now.

17:10.450 --> 17:12.682
This is not the time to play hero,

17:12.684 --> 17:15.853
and I am the last individual
on God's green earth

17:15.855 --> 17:17.887
that you wanna butt
heads with, you hear me?

17:17.890 --> 17:19.990
Oh, yeah, I hear ya.

17:19.992 --> 17:22.862
I hear ya and you sound real scary.

17:24.563 --> 17:26.762
Fuck you, Farmer Jim!

17:26.765 --> 17:29.800
You're all alone out here on the frontier.

17:29.802 --> 17:31.669
No friends, no family,

17:31.671 --> 17:34.172
<i>no cops, no help at all.</i>

17:34.174 --> 17:36.574
This is the Wild West, son.

17:36.576 --> 17:39.042
The Wild fucking West.

17:39.044 --> 17:42.480
There ain't no gods coming
out here to save your ass.

17:42.482 --> 17:46.217
It's just you and me and a murder of crows

17:46.219 --> 17:48.853
waiting to pick over our dead bones.

17:48.855 --> 17:51.756
<i>So you take a breather.</i>

17:51.758 --> 17:54.491
You let that sink in.

17:54.493 --> 17:58.462
But don't take too long, ya hear?

17:58.464 --> 17:59.696
You don't wanna get too much blood

17:59.698 --> 18:02.168
all over your white trash fineries.

18:09.209 --> 18:10.942
I need your help.

18:10.944 --> 18:13.009
I want you to go in the
bathroom and get a first aid kit.

18:13.011 --> 18:14.647
It's under the sink. Go.

18:28.027 --> 18:30.228
Come to papa.

18:30.230 --> 18:32.096
Okay, set it down.

18:32.098 --> 18:34.701
Open it up. Come here.

18:36.703 --> 18:38.672
You're gonna help me, okay?

18:42.075 --> 18:43.774
Carter: <i>Pour this on.</i>

18:43.776 --> 18:46.847
Okay. ( groans )

18:50.183 --> 18:52.149
( panting, groaning )

18:52.151 --> 18:55.952
- ( screams )
- Get it real hot, okay?

18:55.954 --> 18:58.058
<i>Just hold it on there.</i>

19:03.061 --> 19:05.096
All right, slowly put it down.

19:05.098 --> 19:06.700
Don't look.

19:09.769 --> 19:12.772
- ( Carter screams )
- ( Sade screams )

19:17.976 --> 19:19.213
Carter: More.

19:20.613 --> 19:23.180
More, more, more. Come on.

19:23.182 --> 19:25.486
There.

19:30.623 --> 19:32.826
You're supposed to swallow them.

19:37.629 --> 19:40.631
Not when you hurt as bad as I do.

19:40.633 --> 19:43.768
Go... go in the other room.

19:43.770 --> 19:46.938
In a box there are some light bulbs, okay?

19:46.940 --> 19:48.638
Bring me all of them.

19:48.640 --> 19:52.609
And some water. Bring me some water.

19:52.611 --> 19:54.848
<i>( footsteps creaking )</i>

20:04.656 --> 20:06.760
I said all of them. Go.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.968
And towels, bring me some towels.

20:16.970 --> 20:19.740
The bathroom, go. Go.

20:24.844 --> 20:26.613
Please.

20:39.759 --> 20:41.028
Good.

20:56.142 --> 20:58.045
<i>( glass shatters )</i>

21:13.126 --> 21:15.326
That ain't no farmer.

21:15.328 --> 21:17.694
Now even if we're not here,

21:17.696 --> 21:20.196
- we'll hear him if he tries going up the stairs.
- Cool.

21:20.198 --> 21:22.732
What's the water for?

21:22.734 --> 21:25.038
It's for drinking.

21:27.339 --> 21:28.942
Oh.

21:30.742 --> 21:32.311
Want some?

21:33.713 --> 21:36.916
<i>( creaking )</i>

21:40.986 --> 21:42.822
<i>( clatters )</i>

21:50.163 --> 21:53.297
- So, what's your name?
- Isabelle.

21:53.299 --> 21:56.200
But everyone calls me Bird.
I don't like it, though.

21:56.202 --> 21:57.934
Bird?

21:57.936 --> 22:00.971
How'd you get a colorful name like that?

22:00.973 --> 22:03.007
My dad gave it to me.

22:03.009 --> 22:05.843
My mom said he started
calling me his little bird

22:05.845 --> 22:08.315
when I was real small
'cause I never wanted to eat.

22:09.915 --> 22:11.717
He died, though.

22:13.118 --> 22:14.919
They both did.

22:14.921 --> 22:19.226
- Car crash.
- <i>( clattering )</i>

22:21.159 --> 22:22.995
God, I'm...

22:24.196 --> 22:26.232
( exhales ) I'm sorry.

22:29.434 --> 22:32.903
How'd you get in this mess, anyway?

22:32.905 --> 22:34.939
He shot Roger at the cemetery.

22:34.941 --> 22:37.807
- Roger?
- Aunt Jane's boyfriend.

22:37.809 --> 22:39.943
( exhales )

22:39.945 --> 22:43.213
Jesus. I'm sorry.

22:43.215 --> 22:45.816
You apologize a lot

22:45.818 --> 22:47.953
for someone who didn't do anything wrong.

22:50.188 --> 22:52.056
I know. I... I just meant

22:52.058 --> 22:54.157
you know, it's too bad your uncle's dead.

22:54.159 --> 22:57.060
He wasn't my uncle.

22:57.062 --> 23:00.232
But I should've been nicer to him.

23:18.283 --> 23:20.286
- ( exhales )
- <i>( clattering )</i>

23:44.443 --> 23:46.879
He's a monster.

23:49.248 --> 23:51.981
He's no monster. Hey.

23:51.983 --> 23:54.884
Don't give him the satisfaction.

23:54.886 --> 23:56.487
He's no monster.

23:56.489 --> 23:59.192
Yes, he is.

24:03.061 --> 24:04.428
You're all alone?

24:04.430 --> 24:06.430
This big company just moved in

24:06.432 --> 24:08.566
and this whole valley's a graveyard.

24:08.568 --> 24:12.138
The crops are alive,
but the houses are dead.

24:13.940 --> 24:16.343
There's nobody here but scarecrows.

24:17.577 --> 24:19.112
And you.

24:20.479 --> 24:22.415
And me.

24:26.918 --> 24:29.953
- <i>( ball bounces )</i>
- How many bullets do you have?

24:29.955 --> 24:31.891
Just the one.

24:33.158 --> 24:35.124
That's it?

24:35.126 --> 24:38.162
<i>You don't have any more
packed in a box or something?</i>

24:38.164 --> 24:40.064
I'm afraid not.

24:40.066 --> 24:42.465
Last shell in the house.

24:42.467 --> 24:44.902
Don't worry, though.

24:44.904 --> 24:47.273
He doesn't know that.

24:48.374 --> 24:50.441
Can we go out a window?

24:50.443 --> 24:54.010
No. I mean, I'd never
make it with this leg.

24:54.012 --> 24:55.645
You could climb out on your own.

24:55.647 --> 24:58.449
But then I wouldn't be
there to protect you,

24:58.451 --> 25:00.017
and that's just what he wants.

25:00.019 --> 25:02.553
<i>No, we're stuck here
until help comes</i>

25:02.555 --> 25:04.989
<i>or he leaves.</i>

25:04.991 --> 25:07.892
<i>( clattering )</i>

25:07.894 --> 25:09.095
Thank you.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.195
No, don't mention it, Isabelle.

25:12.197 --> 25:14.533
Just... just doing what's right.

25:16.202 --> 25:17.604
Call me Bird if you want.

25:19.137 --> 25:21.107
I thought you didn't like that name.

25:23.309 --> 25:25.212
Depends on who's using it.

25:28.647 --> 25:31.147
Well, pleased to meet you, Bird.

25:31.149 --> 25:33.853
I'm Carter, in case you missed it.

25:43.428 --> 25:45.194
( sighs )

25:45.196 --> 25:47.064
It's a nice camera you got there.

25:47.066 --> 25:49.935
What, are you taking pictures
of the cemetery or something?

25:51.971 --> 25:55.638
Him. I got a picture of
him without his mask on.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.174
- Does he know that?
- I think so.

25:58.176 --> 26:00.512
Well, that's great. Give me the film.

26:06.719 --> 26:09.586
Sade: <i>Hey, tough guy!</i>

26:09.588 --> 26:11.622
<i>I was wondering.</i>

26:11.624 --> 26:13.159
<i>Let me ask you.</i>

26:16.995 --> 26:19.028
What's with all the boxes, huh?

26:19.030 --> 26:21.533
- <i>( shatters )</i>
- ( coughing )

26:23.301 --> 26:26.670
<i>Fixing to jump ship? Hmm?</i>

26:26.672 --> 26:28.638
<i>I bet you wished you'd
scheduled the big move</i>

26:28.640 --> 26:31.911
a day earlier, huh? ( chuckles )

26:33.279 --> 26:35.278
So, hey, man,

26:35.280 --> 26:38.082
what happened to your family, huh?

26:38.084 --> 26:40.487
What, they up and leave your sorry ass?

26:43.088 --> 26:45.622
<i>Is this a broken
home I'm sitting in?</i>

26:45.624 --> 26:48.124
Come on, badass, talk to me!

26:48.126 --> 26:50.326
Don't be shy!

26:50.328 --> 26:52.565
Shit, you can confide in me.

26:54.599 --> 26:57.267
Whoa, whoa! Lookie here.

26:57.269 --> 26:59.470
Soldier boy.

26:59.472 --> 27:02.205
You're a soldier boy.

27:02.207 --> 27:04.674
Damn good one from the
looks of this photograph.

27:04.676 --> 27:07.144
Look at you, all spit and polish

27:07.146 --> 27:09.413
with your shiny medals
and your pretty ribbons.

27:09.415 --> 27:11.414
<i>Hey, where... where were you?</i>

27:11.416 --> 27:13.083
<i>Huh?</i>

27:13.085 --> 27:14.785
Hey, look, I'm ex-military, too, man.

27:14.787 --> 27:17.520
Black ops, you know, real
jackal shit. Where were you?

27:17.522 --> 27:20.423
Iraq? No, no, no.

27:20.425 --> 27:22.593
Afghanistan.

27:22.595 --> 27:24.260
Hey, Sar. Greene!

27:24.262 --> 27:27.698
Hey, Sar. Greene, as one
ex-military man to another,

27:27.700 --> 27:30.567
I salute you

27:30.569 --> 27:33.440
and thank you for your service. ( chuckles )

27:36.207 --> 27:37.607
Damn.

27:37.609 --> 27:40.109
Nice-looking woman you had there, boy.

27:40.111 --> 27:43.047
Real nice-looking.

27:43.049 --> 27:44.347
<i>Hey, you don't mind
if I get her number</i>

27:44.349 --> 27:45.715
<i>when this is all over, do you?</i>

27:45.717 --> 27:47.483
- Just shut up!
- Hey!

27:47.485 --> 27:50.554
- <i>Shut your fucking mouth!</i>
- ( laughs )

27:50.556 --> 27:52.756
Oh, come on, Sar. Greene!

27:52.758 --> 27:55.328
I'm just fucking with you a little bit.

27:58.230 --> 28:00.064
Ah!

28:00.066 --> 28:01.432
Ain't no need for you to get

28:01.434 --> 28:04.233
all furiously articulate on me.

28:04.235 --> 28:06.737
Hey, uh,

28:06.739 --> 28:09.440
just wanna thank you.

28:09.442 --> 28:12.241
Took the liberty of dipping
into your little reserve.

28:12.243 --> 28:14.478
I've been feeling nice and warm.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.547
<i>I hope you got something up there
to keep the chill away, too.</i>

28:16.549 --> 28:18.682
Oh, and, uh,

28:18.684 --> 28:20.784
all bullshit aside,

28:20.786 --> 28:23.554
just between you and me,

28:23.556 --> 28:25.823
<i>I understand where you're
coming from with all this, man.</i>

28:25.825 --> 28:27.657
I understand. I got a little girl myself.

28:27.659 --> 28:30.259
She ain't but... well,
she can't be no older

28:30.261 --> 28:32.162
than the little lady up there

28:32.164 --> 28:35.432
and she means the world to me.

28:35.434 --> 28:38.201
Uh, nothing I wouldn't
do for that little girl.

28:38.203 --> 28:39.670
I mean, that's why I'm
in this line of work.

28:39.672 --> 28:41.538
You know, I got a family that depends on me

28:41.540 --> 28:44.575
and I can't let one little
loose end with a ponytail

28:44.577 --> 28:46.442
take 'em away from me, can I?

28:46.444 --> 28:48.644
I mean, you can't let her get in the way

28:48.646 --> 28:51.214
of you taking care of your
responsibilities either.

28:51.216 --> 28:54.317
Right? I mean, what's more important,

28:54.319 --> 28:56.487
the life of a stranger or...

28:56.489 --> 28:58.221
or the future of your family?

28:58.223 --> 29:00.490
<i>You feel me?</i>

29:00.492 --> 29:02.459
- Take this...
- <i>I mean, am I right?</i>

29:02.461 --> 29:04.795
- Put it in the back of the toilet.
- In the toilet?

29:04.797 --> 29:06.563
In the... in the tank.

29:06.565 --> 29:08.568
- Put it in the tank.
- Oh, okay.

29:09.801 --> 29:12.201
<i>( footsteps creaking )</i>

29:12.203 --> 29:14.171
Hey, let me ask you this.

29:14.173 --> 29:15.806
You wanna see your son again, right?

29:15.808 --> 29:18.174
<i>I mean, am I right?</i>

29:18.176 --> 29:20.477
Well, you ain't wrong, mister.

29:20.479 --> 29:23.212
But what you think I got to lose, man,

29:23.214 --> 29:24.647
I already lost.

29:24.649 --> 29:28.785
The kid stays with me, all right?

29:28.787 --> 29:31.255
Why don't you just go home
to your own daughter, huh?

29:31.257 --> 29:33.490
No can do, partner.

29:33.492 --> 29:35.826
- ( discordant notes playing )
- ( coughs )

29:35.828 --> 29:38.494
No can do.

29:38.496 --> 29:41.832
Once I sink my teeth into
something, I don't pull 'em out

29:41.834 --> 29:43.733
<i>till the thing is dead.</i>

29:43.735 --> 29:45.935
Yeah, you sure about that, pal?

29:45.937 --> 29:48.305
Now, I wouldn't bet on you lasting too long

29:48.307 --> 29:50.574
- with that buckshot in your gut.
- <i>Aw, shit, man,</i>

29:50.576 --> 29:53.576
by my standards this ain't
nothing but a flesh wound.

29:53.578 --> 29:55.578
Yeah, well, mine's a flesh
wound by anybody's standards,

29:55.580 --> 29:58.548
so we'll just see who drops first.

29:58.550 --> 30:00.651
Well, I got a feeling
that that's gonna be you

30:00.653 --> 30:03.452
once I burn this
motherfucker to the ground.

30:03.454 --> 30:05.189
What you got to say to that?

30:05.191 --> 30:07.657
I'm way ahead of you, asshole.

30:07.659 --> 30:10.493
<i>Now, you know just as well as I do</i>

30:10.495 --> 30:12.663
the kid's got a picture of
you without your mask on.

30:12.665 --> 30:14.698
You see, I got you, man!

30:14.700 --> 30:17.634
<i>Film's in a safe place.
It's in a Ziploc bag</i>

30:17.636 --> 30:19.368
<i>under the fucking water.</i>

30:19.370 --> 30:21.438
<i>You know damn well
there's a decent chance</i>

30:21.440 --> 30:23.440
<i>that film will survive the
fire for the cops to find.</i>

30:23.442 --> 30:24.874
I gotta think, man,

30:24.876 --> 30:27.310
that's well past the
level of acceptable risk

30:27.312 --> 30:30.480
for such a trained
professional as yourself.

30:30.482 --> 30:32.316
You know, your sneering, condescending act

30:32.318 --> 30:34.384
really sucks right about now, soldier boy.

30:34.386 --> 30:36.519
You should've stuck to
the purehearted yokel bit.

30:36.521 --> 30:39.957
- That shit was working for you.
- Whatever you say, chief.

30:39.959 --> 30:43.460
Oh, I'm gonna break you into
a million pieces, motherfucker.

30:43.462 --> 30:46.529
A million tiny fucking pieces.

30:46.531 --> 30:48.464
You wanna play with me?

30:48.466 --> 30:49.569
All right, then.

30:51.270 --> 30:53.473
It's fitting to get ugly up in this bitch.

30:57.609 --> 30:59.643
Dispatch: <i>All quiet on
the western front, kid?</i>

30:59.645 --> 31:01.478
Man: <i>That's right.</i>

31:01.480 --> 31:02.712
Same as yesterday.

31:02.714 --> 31:05.449
Same as every yesterday.

31:05.451 --> 31:07.584
I tell you, I don't know how
this place keeps itself together

31:07.586 --> 31:09.419
between my rounds.

31:09.421 --> 31:10.621
Dispatch: <i>Rookies eat
their grits and like it.</i>

31:10.623 --> 31:12.422
<i>Just swallow and smile, kid.</i>

31:12.424 --> 31:14.258
Hey, I got a question for you.

31:14.260 --> 31:16.727
When are you old dogs
gonna stop calling me "kid"?

31:16.729 --> 31:19.997
<i>Until you earn your
wings. Don't take offense.</i>

31:19.999 --> 31:22.999
<i>That's just how it is
around these parts.</i>

31:23.001 --> 31:25.469
And how do I earn my wings?

31:25.471 --> 31:27.837
<i>Well, you can start by
getting your ass over</i>

31:27.839 --> 31:29.806
<i>to Clem Thatcher's place.</i>

31:29.808 --> 31:32.375
<i>Them teenagers been
messing around on his land.</i>

31:32.377 --> 31:34.246
( sighs ) Again?

31:35.513 --> 31:37.580
Uh...

31:37.582 --> 31:39.418
<i>You see something, kid?</i>

31:41.386 --> 31:44.456
It's probably nothing.
I'll get back to you.

31:46.759 --> 31:47.926
( cuts engine )

31:59.003 --> 32:00.807
( creaking )

32:38.743 --> 32:39.712
( silent )

32:55.860 --> 32:57.696
Bird?

33:00.566 --> 33:03.432
Bird, I need a drink.

33:03.434 --> 33:05.902
More water?

33:05.904 --> 33:06.838
<i>No.</i>

33:08.440 --> 33:10.743
There's some other bottles up in the attic.

33:12.677 --> 33:15.681
Aunt Jane gets angry when she drinks.

33:17.148 --> 33:20.150
Yeah, well, I get angry when I don't drink.

33:20.152 --> 33:22.685
Hey, just...

33:22.687 --> 33:23.790
...go get me a bottle.

33:28.626 --> 33:29.729
( sighs )

34:12.737 --> 34:15.538
- Where did you get that?
- I'm sorry. I'll put it back.

34:15.540 --> 34:17.476
Where did you get that? Put it back.

34:18.577 --> 34:20.612
Put it back now.

34:21.713 --> 34:24.050
<i>( footsteps creaking )</i>

34:29.754 --> 34:32.023
( grunting )

35:09.694 --> 35:11.763
<i>"Mara,</i>

35:13.631 --> 35:16.765
<i>I could never say this to you</i>

35:16.767 --> 35:19.169
<i>face-to-face</i>

35:19.171 --> 35:21.937
even though you told me over and over again

35:21.939 --> 35:24.073
that it wasn't my fault.

35:24.075 --> 35:27.511
Your eyes never hid the truth.

35:27.513 --> 35:29.712
<i>I killed our son.</i>

35:29.714 --> 35:31.117
<i>I let him die.</i>

35:48.033 --> 35:49.598
I want you to know

35:49.600 --> 35:51.667
that you did the right thing leaving me."

35:51.669 --> 35:53.205
You motherfucker.

35:58.776 --> 36:00.743
"I hope one day you find it in your heart

36:00.745 --> 36:02.044
to forgive me.

36:02.046 --> 36:05.314
I'm so sorry I was so weak.

36:05.316 --> 36:07.953
- Carter."

<i>( Sade laughing )</i>

36:19.631 --> 36:21.964
<i>God damn, Sergeant Greene.</i>

36:21.966 --> 36:24.200
That sure is a whole lot of apologies.

36:24.202 --> 36:27.102
Exactly how many kids did you get killed?

36:27.104 --> 36:28.773
<i>( Sade laughing )</i>

36:34.680 --> 36:36.680
Don't look at me.

36:36.682 --> 36:38.584
Don't look at me!

36:40.651 --> 36:43.587
Well, now I know why you
had that cannon so handy.

36:43.589 --> 36:45.988
You packed the place up,

36:45.990 --> 36:48.792
got drunk,

36:48.794 --> 36:50.759
then you stopped and thought about it.

36:50.761 --> 36:54.663
<i>Decided that life wasn't
worth living anymore, was it?</i>

36:54.665 --> 36:55.901
Well, hell...

36:58.236 --> 37:00.370
...don't let this little
fiasco with the kid

37:00.372 --> 37:01.937
ruin your whole afternoon.

37:01.939 --> 37:03.772
By all means, go ahead!

37:03.774 --> 37:05.341
Act like the two of us ain't even here

37:05.343 --> 37:08.713
and blow your goddamn
brains out! ( laughing )

37:11.649 --> 37:14.618
Whoo! Whoo, hoo, hoo!

37:14.620 --> 37:16.720
Oh, but, no, seriously, man,

37:16.722 --> 37:18.721
I know where you're coming from, though.

37:18.723 --> 37:21.156
I do.

37:21.158 --> 37:23.628
<i>Shit, she ain't your kid.</i>

37:25.162 --> 37:26.830
Can't turn back time.

37:26.832 --> 37:27.800
Believe me, I done tried.

37:29.700 --> 37:31.102
<i>But you know I'm
gonna win this thing.</i>

37:32.403 --> 37:35.006
Even Tombstone courage runs out.

37:36.707 --> 37:39.278
You need to go ahead on
and give in to the beast.

37:41.213 --> 37:43.649
Send the little lady down here to me.

37:48.185 --> 37:49.921
Come and get her.

38:01.867 --> 38:03.635
<i>( crow caws )</i>

38:04.903 --> 38:06.339
Hello?

38:08.740 --> 38:10.743
( urinating )

38:17.749 --> 38:19.115
<i>Hey!</i>

38:19.117 --> 38:21.450
<i>You guys wanna order some pizza?</i>

38:21.452 --> 38:23.688
<i>( Sade laughs )</i>

38:27.426 --> 38:28.894
Bird: <i>I'm sorry.</i>

38:31.430 --> 38:33.930
No, don't be sorry. I...

38:33.932 --> 38:36.334
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

38:46.711 --> 38:48.747
What was your son's name?

38:51.783 --> 38:53.019
Sam.

38:54.486 --> 38:56.055
You miss him?

38:58.756 --> 39:00.290
Every day.

39:00.292 --> 39:02.694
I miss my parents, too.

39:06.097 --> 39:08.230
"There ain't no quitting me."

39:08.232 --> 39:10.001
What?

39:11.303 --> 39:12.836
"There ain't no quitting me."

39:12.838 --> 39:15.240
Just something my dad used to say.

39:18.109 --> 39:20.879
It always made me feel safe.

39:24.515 --> 39:27.183
You think I'll see him when I die?

39:27.185 --> 39:30.053
Hey, don't talk like that, okay?

39:30.055 --> 39:32.321
Help will be here soon.

39:32.323 --> 39:36.095
Don't say that, Carter. I'm not stupid.

39:38.530 --> 39:40.229
All right.

39:40.231 --> 39:42.867
Maybe help ain't coming.

39:45.102 --> 39:46.236
( sighs )

39:46.238 --> 39:48.307
But I can promise you this...

39:50.876 --> 39:53.075
I won't let him get you.

39:53.077 --> 39:55.246
<i>You hear me?</i>

39:56.948 --> 39:59.785
I won't let him get you.

40:02.419 --> 40:04.889
You believe me?

40:08.459 --> 40:10.995
Why'd your wife leave?

40:13.865 --> 40:15.430
Me.

40:15.432 --> 40:17.802
This place.

40:20.037 --> 40:23.138
Reminded, uh, her

40:23.140 --> 40:24.776
of him.

40:26.812 --> 40:28.748
I just wish...

40:30.848 --> 40:32.582
( exhales )

40:32.584 --> 40:34.419
<i>just...</i>

40:36.220 --> 40:37.388
<i>wish...</i>

40:43.562 --> 40:45.297
I believe you.

- ( Bird gasps )

40:51.937 --> 40:53.535
<i>( Bird's footsteps pounding )</i>

40:53.537 --> 40:56.407
Just keeping you on your toes, buddy.

40:57.876 --> 40:58.975
Here, have another one.

40:58.977 --> 41:01.446
<i>( gunshot echoes )</i>

41:12.390 --> 41:14.357
How y'all doing up there?

41:14.359 --> 41:16.392
Carter: <i>I could ask
you the same question,</i>

41:16.394 --> 41:18.093
<i>you loose sack of shit!</i>

41:18.095 --> 41:20.897
You know, you sound like a sick animal

41:20.899 --> 41:23.533
who's hunting around
for a corner to die in.

41:23.535 --> 41:26.269
<i>You feeling kind of cold?</i>

41:26.271 --> 41:27.937
<i>Kind of weak?</i>

41:27.939 --> 41:29.906
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:29.908 --> 41:32.140
<i>You're going into shock, pal.</i>

41:32.142 --> 41:34.644
<i>Gonna die.</i>

41:34.646 --> 41:37.479
<i>Soon unless you get to a hospital.</i>

41:37.481 --> 41:40.149
Fuck you! I'm fine!

41:40.151 --> 41:42.252
<i>I ain't going nowhere</i>

41:42.254 --> 41:44.453
<i>till that little bitch
is pushing up daisies!</i>

41:44.455 --> 41:48.290
- <i>Period!</i>
- That suits me just fine, mister.

41:48.292 --> 41:50.959
Nothing bleeds forever.

41:50.961 --> 41:52.428
<i>Another few hours,</i>

41:52.430 --> 41:55.031
<i>you'll be lying facedown</i>

41:55.033 --> 41:57.332
<i>in a puddle of your own fluids.</i>

41:57.334 --> 41:59.201
Hey, don't worry, though.

41:59.203 --> 42:01.069
I'll let your daughter know you died

42:01.071 --> 42:03.640
<i>defending the future of your family.</i>

42:03.642 --> 42:06.341
Oh, outstanding, Sergeant Greene.

42:06.343 --> 42:08.144
Out-fucking-standing.

42:08.146 --> 42:10.078
You beat me at my own game.

42:10.080 --> 42:13.549
You're a master of psychological warfare!

42:13.551 --> 42:14.917
Next thing you know,

42:14.919 --> 42:16.919
you'll have me tidying up the place

42:16.921 --> 42:19.221
and giving you a blowjob on the way out.

42:19.223 --> 42:21.256
<i>Brilliant!</i>

42:21.258 --> 42:22.491
<i>( camera shutter clicks )</i>

42:22.493 --> 42:24.593
- Sorry.
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

42:24.595 --> 42:27.398
No film in that camera.

42:29.234 --> 42:31.301
Yeah, it just makes me feel safe.

42:31.303 --> 42:32.538
It's stupid, I know.

42:35.073 --> 42:37.443
We all got our ways of dealing with stuff.

42:48.019 --> 42:50.218
What? What is it?

42:50.220 --> 42:51.520
<i>Shh.</i>

42:51.522 --> 42:54.357
Just reminds me...

42:54.359 --> 42:56.158
we got a problem.

42:56.160 --> 42:58.227
How big?

42:58.229 --> 43:00.330
It's big.

43:00.332 --> 43:02.732
There's a generator in the basement

43:02.734 --> 43:04.334
that runs the whole power, you see?

43:04.336 --> 43:06.171
I haven't filled it up in days.

43:07.472 --> 43:09.504
It's running on fumes.

43:09.506 --> 43:12.008
I don't understand.

43:12.010 --> 43:13.977
It'll be night soon, Bird.

43:13.979 --> 43:16.345
Without any power, the whole
house will be pitch-black.

43:16.347 --> 43:18.046
<i>There's no way I can keep him</i>

43:18.048 --> 43:19.582
from trying something in the dark.

43:19.584 --> 43:21.750
Not with one shot.

43:21.752 --> 43:23.521
What does that mean?

43:26.256 --> 43:28.390
It means I gotta get you out of here

43:28.392 --> 43:30.727
while it's still light out.

43:30.729 --> 43:33.363
But your leg.

43:33.365 --> 43:36.332
I'm not going with you.

43:36.334 --> 43:39.067
I'm gonna help you climb out a
window so you can run for help.

43:39.069 --> 43:41.537
- But you said that's what he wants!
- I know what I said, Bird,

43:41.539 --> 43:43.006
but things are different now, okay?

43:43.008 --> 43:44.774
You gotta trust me on this.

43:44.776 --> 43:47.576
This is your best chance.

43:47.578 --> 43:49.981
<i>Okay?</i>

43:59.024 --> 44:00.960
Oh, fuck.

44:08.265 --> 44:10.165
Hey, is the, uh,

44:10.167 --> 44:12.734
shooting range on Red
Pepper open for the fall yet?

44:12.736 --> 44:15.370
Dispatch: <i>What's that, kid?</i>

44:15.372 --> 44:17.540
The shooting range on Red Pepper,

44:17.542 --> 44:19.207
is it open now?

44:19.209 --> 44:21.310
<i>Nope. Why?</i>

44:21.312 --> 44:23.712
I... I'm not sure, I, uh...

44:23.714 --> 44:26.452
I'm at the cemetery and I heard...

44:28.385 --> 44:30.621
<i>What's that? What did you hear, kid?</i>

44:32.189 --> 44:34.256
<i>Kid?</i>

44:34.258 --> 44:37.192
Nothing. Uh...

44:37.194 --> 44:39.529
I'm gonna look into something.
I'll get back to you.

44:39.531 --> 44:42.201
And stop calling me "kid."

44:43.834 --> 44:45.670
( engine starts )

44:59.584 --> 45:01.183
All right, let's go.

45:01.185 --> 45:02.819
What if he realizes you aren't guarding

45:02.821 --> 45:04.453
the stairs anymore?

45:04.455 --> 45:06.288
We got the broken glass.
We'll hear him. Come on.

45:06.290 --> 45:08.323
Now, I want you to climb
down on this roof, right?

45:08.325 --> 45:09.758
There's a crate. Jump down on it.

45:09.760 --> 45:12.261
Run like hell, all right?

45:12.263 --> 45:14.663
Hey, hey. Even if he hears you,

45:14.665 --> 45:17.366
you'll be a little speck on the
horizon by the time he gets outside.

45:17.368 --> 45:19.569
- I don't wanna do this.
- Neither do I, Bird,

45:19.571 --> 45:21.870
but we have to. We don't have a choice.

45:21.872 --> 45:24.475
<i>( floorboards creaking )</i>

45:44.863 --> 45:47.363
- Come on. Give me the camera.
- No.

45:47.365 --> 45:48.897
Come on, I'll take good care of it.

45:48.899 --> 45:51.369
Don't you trust me? Come on.

45:52.736 --> 45:54.439
Bird, I...

45:56.207 --> 45:58.510
Okay, keep the camera. Come on. Go.

46:00.178 --> 46:01.743
That's it.

46:01.745 --> 46:03.548
Stay low.

46:05.883 --> 46:07.385
Okay, go. Come on.

46:10.455 --> 46:12.691
That's it, you got it.

46:36.613 --> 46:38.382
<i>( knocking )</i>

46:42.352 --> 46:44.854
- <i>( knocking )</i>
- ( gunshot )

46:44.856 --> 46:47.689
<i>( gasps, clattering )</i>

46:47.691 --> 46:49.827
<i>( thudding )</i>

46:53.263 --> 46:55.166
( panting )

46:56.834 --> 46:58.636
Afternoon, Officer.

47:01.472 --> 47:03.642
- What the fuck?
- ( screams )

47:04.876 --> 47:06.544
Shit.

47:13.651 --> 47:15.917
( gun clicking )

47:15.919 --> 47:18.756
Shit!

47:25.997 --> 47:27.499
( thuds )

47:59.330 --> 48:02.698
- Carter!
- What?

48:02.700 --> 48:05.337
He hid the police car in the hangar.

48:11.408 --> 48:13.477
What? Where is he now?

48:15.879 --> 48:17.412
He's far.

48:17.414 --> 48:19.817
He's walking back around the front.

48:27.357 --> 48:28.624
Freeze!

48:28.626 --> 48:30.558
Put your fucking hands up in the air.

48:30.560 --> 48:32.997
Hands up. That's right.

48:34.298 --> 48:35.531
It's over.

48:35.533 --> 48:37.433
It's time for you to leave.

48:37.435 --> 48:39.035
I ain't got my glasses on,

48:39.037 --> 48:41.504
but that looks like that
same candy-ass 20 gauge

48:41.506 --> 48:43.372
you've been counting on this whole time.

48:43.374 --> 48:46.408
Heavy on power, shit for range?

48:46.410 --> 48:48.711
That's all you got, ain't it?

48:48.713 --> 48:52.381
You got until the count of five

48:52.383 --> 48:56.051
to turn around and get
the fuck off my property!

48:56.053 --> 48:57.653
You got to be kidding me.

48:57.655 --> 48:58.953
You probably couldn't even nick me

48:58.955 --> 49:00.756
with that potty trainer from up there,

49:00.758 --> 49:02.591
let alone make a kill shot.

49:02.593 --> 49:05.560
Hell, how many bullets
you got left, Jethro?

49:05.562 --> 49:07.330
I got plenty!

49:07.332 --> 49:08.531
All right?

49:08.533 --> 49:09.698
Don't you worry about it.

49:09.700 --> 49:12.401
I got six reloads waiting on your ass!

49:12.403 --> 49:14.837
Good God damn, six reloads?

49:14.839 --> 49:16.839
<i>Whoo, you're practically swimming</i>

49:16.841 --> 49:18.374
<i>in ammunition up there.</i>

49:18.376 --> 49:20.408
Well, why not go ahead and try your luck?

49:20.410 --> 49:22.645
You might sink a pellet
in my eye, take me down.

49:22.647 --> 49:24.647
Come on, what you waiting on?

49:24.649 --> 49:27.783
- Fire away!
- I'm not gonna kill you if I don't have to.

49:27.785 --> 49:29.352
When I first got to this dump,

49:29.354 --> 49:31.520
you spit fire at me just to say howdy do.

49:31.522 --> 49:32.821
Now you wanna play trigger-shy?

49:32.823 --> 49:34.656
I don't buy that for a minute.

49:34.658 --> 49:38.660
Are you riding on just one
shell up there, partner?

49:38.662 --> 49:40.995
<i>You are, aren't you?</i>

49:40.997 --> 49:43.031
<i>And if you take the shot at me</i>

49:43.033 --> 49:45.968
at this range and miss, it's over.

49:45.970 --> 49:48.537
<i>I don't think you can
afford to take that risk.</i>

49:48.539 --> 49:50.508
<i>Let's ask the little lady.</i>

49:52.776 --> 49:54.410
Five.

49:54.412 --> 49:56.011
I ain't going nowhere.

49:56.013 --> 49:57.846
You might as well save your
breath, go on and shoot.

49:57.848 --> 50:00.383
- Four.
- Look, I'm fitting to pull my pistol out

50:00.385 --> 50:02.051
- and shoot you now.
- Three!

50:02.053 --> 50:03.785
I suggest you either shoot me

50:03.787 --> 50:05.955
- or get your ass back inside.
- Two!

50:05.957 --> 50:07.693
- One!
- Shit!

50:09.926 --> 50:12.093
I ain't calling you a liar, Sar. Greene,

50:12.095 --> 50:15.464
but you got to be the most
merciful man I ever met.

50:15.466 --> 50:18.033
Hey, little lady. ( laughs )

50:18.035 --> 50:20.870
I just wanna shoot you.

50:20.872 --> 50:23.738
Hey, you made the right call, soldier boy!

50:23.740 --> 50:25.875
Yes, indeed! Who are you to gamble

50:25.877 --> 50:27.877
with that little girl's life?

50:27.879 --> 50:31.383
Let's see if you gamble
with somebody else's.

50:36.421 --> 50:37.953
Sade: <i>Roll call!</i>

50:37.955 --> 50:40.089
That's you, Enis.

50:40.091 --> 50:42.424
- Come on.
- ( gasps )

50:42.426 --> 50:45.093
- Tell us a little bit about yourself.
- You sick son of a bitch.

50:45.095 --> 50:47.796
Don't you disappoint me, hillbilly.

50:47.798 --> 50:50.499
And speak up

50:50.501 --> 50:52.968
so the man upstairs can hear you.

50:52.970 --> 50:54.703
( panting ) My...

50:54.705 --> 50:56.839
my name is Officer Gerald Baker.

50:56.841 --> 51:00.575
Sade: <i>Jerry Baker! ( laughs )</i>

51:00.577 --> 51:03.712
Oh, tell us about, uh...
about the wife and kids,

51:03.714 --> 51:06.482
- two-cow garage.
- I have a wife

51:06.484 --> 51:09.017
- <i>and a son.</i>
- <i>Names, damn it! Give the man names!</i>

51:09.019 --> 51:11.620
<i>My wife's name is Linda</i>

51:11.622 --> 51:13.988
- <i>and my son's name...</i>
- All right, cut it out!

51:13.990 --> 51:16.058
<i>This ain't gonna work!</i>

51:16.060 --> 51:18.694
<i>Just save yourself the effort.</i>

51:18.696 --> 51:20.629
You need to think about it, Sar. Greene.

51:20.631 --> 51:22.163
You need to think about it real hard,

51:22.165 --> 51:24.500
<i>get your mind right, see?</i>

51:24.502 --> 51:26.769
- ( sobbing )
- Jerry here ain't seen my face,

51:26.771 --> 51:28.703
just like you, which means,

51:28.705 --> 51:30.738
technically, he's off the hook.

51:30.740 --> 51:32.975
Also, he's not hurt too bad,

51:32.977 --> 51:35.611
which means you can probably
get him to the hospital.

51:35.613 --> 51:36.912
<i>But you're gonna have
to do it right quick,</i>

51:36.914 --> 51:38.948
<i>I mean, like, pronto.</i>

51:38.950 --> 51:40.950
You don't have the leverage
that you think you do, asshole.

51:40.952 --> 51:42.517
Fuck leverage!

51:42.519 --> 51:44.053
Do the math, dipshit!

51:44.055 --> 51:46.120
You send the little lady
down to me right now,

51:46.122 --> 51:49.258
you're saving two lives
in exchange for one.

51:49.260 --> 51:52.026
Not to toot my own horn, but
that's a hell of a bargain.

51:52.028 --> 51:54.095
Fuck you!

51:54.097 --> 51:55.964
Okay, you heard it, Jer.

51:55.966 --> 51:57.602
Have it your way.

52:01.071 --> 52:03.238
Oh, quit your whining.

52:03.240 --> 52:06.040
Hold on, hold on. I got
something here for you.

52:06.042 --> 52:07.977
- <i>Here we go.</i>
- No. ( sobs )

52:07.979 --> 52:09.912
All right.

52:09.914 --> 52:12.982
That's it. Oh, yeah. That's
it, that's it. All right.

52:12.984 --> 52:14.216
What are you doing?

52:14.218 --> 52:15.553
Stand back now.

52:18.555 --> 52:20.656
- ( bone crunches )
- ( screams )

52:20.658 --> 52:22.127
- ( gasps )
- <i>( Baker sobs )</i>

52:27.097 --> 52:29.133
- ( bone crunches )
- Oh, God!

52:33.671 --> 52:35.604
What's he even doing?

52:35.606 --> 52:37.105
- ( Baker screams )
- Go. Get out of here.

52:37.107 --> 52:38.908
Go. Go upstairs.

52:38.910 --> 52:42.076
Get upstairs now! Go.

52:42.078 --> 52:44.249
- Don't listen!
- <i>( bone crunches )</i>

52:47.184 --> 52:48.950
Four down, four to go!

52:48.952 --> 52:51.185
- Your thumbs get a pass.
- Oh, you sick fuck!

52:51.187 --> 52:53.988
Listen up, soldier boy!
What's it gonna be?!

52:53.990 --> 52:57.191
Me and Jerry Baker are waiting
for you to send her ass down!

52:57.193 --> 52:58.993
You piece of shit!

52:58.995 --> 53:01.629
You're a piece of fucking
shit, you know that?

53:01.631 --> 53:03.167
Sticks and stones, my friend.

53:04.901 --> 53:06.972
All right, have it your way.

53:09.205 --> 53:11.941
Stay with me. It's just you and me.

53:11.943 --> 53:13.611
Please stop! ( sobs )

53:17.881 --> 53:19.149
- ( bone crunches )
- ( screams )

53:21.017 --> 53:23.187
- <i>( hammer thudding )</i>
- <i>( Baker screams )</i>

53:27.124 --> 53:29.528
- <i>( hammer thuds )</i>
- <i>( Baker sobs )</i>

53:36.767 --> 53:38.767
I was gonna start with the toes,

53:38.769 --> 53:42.104
but I guess I lost the
stomach for the hard stuff.

53:42.106 --> 53:44.372
( sobbing )

53:44.374 --> 53:47.075
Hey, listen, partner.

53:47.077 --> 53:49.678
<i>It's decision time.</i>

53:49.680 --> 53:52.050
( sobs ) Please, no.

53:53.950 --> 53:56.651
Please.

53:56.653 --> 53:58.252
- Listen, man!
- ( sobs ) No.

53:58.254 --> 54:01.357
If you don't send that
little girl down here

54:01.359 --> 54:04.759
with that film, and I mean right now,

54:04.761 --> 54:08.663
I'm fixing to Jackson
Pollock Jerry Baker's brains

54:08.665 --> 54:12.133
<i>all over the motherfucking floor.</i>

54:12.135 --> 54:13.935
Man,

54:13.937 --> 54:16.071
you kill that guy, it's 'cause you want to!

54:16.073 --> 54:17.906
<i>You're just looking for an excuse!</i>

54:17.908 --> 54:19.841
You wanna kill somebody?!

54:19.843 --> 54:21.343
You go ahead!

54:21.345 --> 54:23.678
<i>You got fucking brain damage!</i>

54:23.680 --> 54:25.046
You're a sick fuck

54:25.048 --> 54:26.381
and you want to!

54:26.383 --> 54:28.619
- Not because...
- <i>( gunshot )</i>

54:33.223 --> 54:35.160
<i>( clattering )</i>

54:49.807 --> 54:52.644
A simple yes or no would've worked.

54:54.711 --> 54:58.046
But, you know, you done
really pissed me off, Jethro.

54:58.048 --> 55:01.883
Matter of fact, you done lost
all your conversation privileges.

55:01.885 --> 55:03.384
Yeah!

55:03.386 --> 55:05.854
Radio silence starts right now!

55:05.856 --> 55:07.355
And it ends when you're ready

55:07.357 --> 55:08.991
to send the little girl down.

55:08.993 --> 55:12.326
Well, that suits me just fine, asshole.

55:12.328 --> 55:14.698
I'm sick of hearing your
goddamn voice anyway.

55:18.002 --> 55:19.767
Just do me a favor... when you drop dead,

55:19.769 --> 55:21.069
just do it real loud, okay,

55:21.071 --> 55:23.107
so I can hear it from up here.

55:29.879 --> 55:31.682
<i>( insects chirping )</i>

55:48.131 --> 55:50.367
Hey, asshole.

55:59.243 --> 56:02.113
I don't hear him walking around anymore.

56:05.482 --> 56:07.251
What's he doing?

56:17.461 --> 56:19.330
Let's find out.

56:21.131 --> 56:23.233
All right, cocksucker.

56:25.035 --> 56:26.535
All right, you win.

56:26.537 --> 56:28.270
I gotta...

56:28.272 --> 56:31.339
I gotta get to a hospital, man.

56:31.341 --> 56:33.441
You... you can have her.

56:33.443 --> 56:34.945
<i>You can have the girl, okay?</i>

56:39.015 --> 56:41.350
You hear me? You win.

56:41.352 --> 56:44.086
I'm sending her down, all right?

56:44.088 --> 56:45.553
Just...

56:45.555 --> 56:47.089
Just get the fuck out of here

56:47.091 --> 56:48.993
when I do, okay?

56:58.368 --> 56:59.738
He ain't down there.

57:02.272 --> 57:04.038
He must've gone outside again.

57:04.040 --> 57:06.241
I'm gonna sneak down there,
wait for him to come back in,

57:06.243 --> 57:07.810
and blow him in half.

57:07.812 --> 57:09.243
- It's a trick.
- No, no.

57:09.245 --> 57:11.013
I just offered you up like he wants.

57:11.015 --> 57:13.247
That trumps anything else he's got cooking.

57:13.249 --> 57:16.517
He ain't talking back
'cause he ain't down there.

57:16.519 --> 57:18.486
No, he's waiting for you!

57:18.488 --> 57:21.857
Get in the bathroom. Lock the door.

57:21.859 --> 57:24.892
- Carter, don't go.
- No time to argue.

57:24.894 --> 57:27.296
Now get in there. Go. Now.

57:27.298 --> 57:28.832
<i>Don't come out.</i>

57:30.066 --> 57:31.969
<i>( lock clicks )</i>

57:39.343 --> 57:41.178
( glass crunching )

58:59.089 --> 59:01.226
<i>( creaking )</i>

59:21.577 --> 59:22.980
Bird.

59:42.098 --> 59:44.301
( creaking )

59:46.002 --> 59:48.136
Carter, are you back?

59:48.138 --> 59:49.671
Hey, now, little lady. Come on out.

59:49.673 --> 59:51.406
- ( creaks )
- Sade: Shit!

59:51.408 --> 59:53.645
- ( gunshot )
- ( screaming )

59:57.281 --> 59:59.647
( screaming )

59:59.649 --> 01:00:02.519
- Fuck!
- Fuck. ( groans )

01:00:04.088 --> 01:00:07.055
God damn, that had to hurt!

01:00:07.057 --> 01:00:10.558
Ow! Yeah, this just
really ain't your day, pal.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.328
Hey, you wanna think about packing it in

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:14.696
and heading to the hospital, huh?

01:00:14.698 --> 01:00:17.098
<i>Before somebody gets hurt.</i>

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:20.203
- <i>Man.</i>
- ( grunting )

01:00:21.537 --> 01:00:23.104
<i>( glass tinkles )</i>

01:00:23.106 --> 01:00:25.307
Things ain't looking
too good for you, buddy.

01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:28.109
This is a lousy place
for the end of the road.

01:00:28.111 --> 01:00:29.981
Think this shit is funny, huh?

01:00:31.214 --> 01:00:33.180
Okay, hillbilly.

01:00:33.182 --> 01:00:36.084
All right.

01:00:36.086 --> 01:00:38.522
- ( groans )
- ( discordant notes playing )

01:00:41.392 --> 01:00:43.528
I'll show you how funny this shit is.

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:50.400
( groans ) I've had enough.

01:01:01.711 --> 01:01:03.080
( chuckles )

01:01:06.517 --> 01:01:09.220
Fuck the film. I'll take my chances.

01:01:24.133 --> 01:01:25.302
What are you doing?

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.309
Wouldn't you like to know?

01:02:25.461 --> 01:02:27.564
- ( sighs )
- Carter: <i>Yeah, that's good, man.</i>

01:02:29.298 --> 01:02:31.501
Keep moving around,
keep that blood pumping.

01:02:33.604 --> 01:02:35.606
Wouldn't want you to lay down,

01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:39.776
close your eyes and never open them again.

01:02:41.444 --> 01:02:43.113
Go fuck yourself.

01:02:44.314 --> 01:02:46.314
<i>What?</i>

01:02:46.316 --> 01:02:47.848
Trying to help you.

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:51.586
Bleeding to death's not
such a bad way to go.

01:02:51.588 --> 01:02:54.788
You just kind of drift off.

01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:58.428
Yeah, what dead motherfucker
did you hear that from?

01:03:02.265 --> 01:03:04.432
You know, I'm surprised you
haven't called for backup.

01:03:04.434 --> 01:03:07.301
Backup? Ha!

01:03:07.303 --> 01:03:09.303
( groans )

01:03:09.305 --> 01:03:11.238
That little girl IDs me,

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.544
it's my ass, not my employer's.

01:03:15.946 --> 01:03:18.879
My witness, my problem.

01:03:18.881 --> 01:03:22.417
I'm a contractor, mister.

01:03:22.419 --> 01:03:24.919
A professional, huh?

01:03:24.921 --> 01:03:28.355
I don't lose. I don't ask for help.

01:03:28.357 --> 01:03:30.691
That's what keeps me employed.

01:03:30.693 --> 01:03:32.894
Yeah, well,

01:03:32.896 --> 01:03:35.263
that's what's gonna put
you in the ground, too,

01:03:35.265 --> 01:03:37.732
if you don't throw the
towel in soon, buddy.

01:03:37.734 --> 01:03:40.968
I mean, what the fuck are we doing, man?

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:43.404
This is like a pissing contest for you.

01:03:43.406 --> 01:03:44.872
Life ain't nothing

01:03:44.874 --> 01:03:46.508
but one big fucking

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:48.776
pissing contest, soldier boy.

01:03:48.778 --> 01:03:50.678
Ain't you been paying attention?

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.580
Shit.

01:03:52.582 --> 01:03:55.984
I don't die unless the
motherfucker trying to kill me

01:03:55.986 --> 01:03:57.252
earns it.

01:03:57.254 --> 01:03:58.953
<i>You ain't earned it.</i>

01:03:58.955 --> 01:04:01.689
<i>I'll be damned if I let
some chickenshit like you</i>

01:04:01.691 --> 01:04:04.258
<i>take me out.</i>

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.830
( sighs ) This ain't about me.

01:04:08.631 --> 01:04:11.399
I'm not the guy you're fighting, am I?

01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:13.734
Yeah.

01:04:13.736 --> 01:04:16.773
<i>I think I'm starting to understand.</i>

01:04:18.542 --> 01:04:22.410
You'll never understand
a man like me, chump.

01:04:22.412 --> 01:04:25.683
Are you really the monster
you want me to think you are?

01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:29.850
You don't have a daughter, do ya?

01:04:29.852 --> 01:04:31.819
Yeah, I got a daughter.

01:04:31.821 --> 01:04:33.687
What, you think monsters don't breed?

01:04:33.689 --> 01:04:36.860
How do you get to be what you are?

01:04:38.794 --> 01:04:41.529
Oh, what the fuck is it with you?

01:04:41.531 --> 01:04:44.366
You wanna be my friend,
you wanna be my shrink?

01:04:44.368 --> 01:04:46.734
Huh? Or did you just fall in love

01:04:46.736 --> 01:04:49.571
with the velvet baritone of my voice?

01:04:49.573 --> 01:04:51.406
Come on, man.

01:04:51.408 --> 01:04:54.375
( exhales ) You wanna know,

01:04:54.377 --> 01:04:56.948
tough guy, huh?

01:04:58.347 --> 01:05:00.383
<i>How you get to be like me?</i>

01:05:07.591 --> 01:05:09.390
Oh, Jesus.

01:05:09.392 --> 01:05:11.459
Oh, let's see.

01:05:11.461 --> 01:05:13.727
Oh, yeah.

01:05:13.729 --> 01:05:16.698
The first guy I killed,

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:19.868
it broke me up a bit.

01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:21.970
No, a lot.

01:05:21.972 --> 01:05:24.406
I couldn't eat.

01:05:24.408 --> 01:05:26.908
Couldn't sleep.

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:29.977
Couldn't even look myself in the mirror.

01:05:29.979 --> 01:05:32.846
Then something strange happened.

01:05:32.848 --> 01:05:35.984
Killed another fellow,
I felt a little better.

01:05:35.986 --> 01:05:39.053
Killed another fellow,
I felt a little better.

01:05:39.055 --> 01:05:41.689
Fellow after that, better.

01:05:41.691 --> 01:05:44.926
Pretty soon, the more
jobs I got under my belt,

01:05:44.928 --> 01:05:47.897
the easier I slept at night.

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:51.633
How many people did that take?

01:05:51.635 --> 01:05:54.468
I don't know. I don't count.

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:56.404
Let's just say

01:05:56.406 --> 01:05:59.741
these days I sleep like a baby.

01:05:59.743 --> 01:06:01.743
I don't know.

01:06:01.745 --> 01:06:03.877
I don't know how you could
live with something like that.

01:06:03.879 --> 01:06:06.714
Well, something I read once, uh,

01:06:06.716 --> 01:06:09.019
stuck with me.

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.323
"He who makes a beast of himself...

01:06:15.559 --> 01:06:18.359
loses the pain of being a man.

01:06:18.361 --> 01:06:20.430
Well,

01:06:21.832 --> 01:06:24.435
we all got our ways of dealing with stuff.

01:06:26.702 --> 01:06:28.770
Guess for you, it's killing people.

01:06:28.772 --> 01:06:30.839
I kill 'cause it's my job.

01:06:30.841 --> 01:06:32.674
I take orders.

01:06:32.676 --> 01:06:35.542
You were a soldier, you
know what that's like.

01:06:35.544 --> 01:06:36.910
<i>Don't pull that card, pal.</i>

01:06:36.912 --> 01:06:39.046
We don't kill kids.

01:06:39.048 --> 01:06:41.582
I kill for two reasons...
money and necessity.

01:06:41.584 --> 01:06:43.917
I don't kill for pleasure,

01:06:43.919 --> 01:06:46.087
I never have, I never will.

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:48.089
Why don't we roll out Jerry Baker

01:06:48.091 --> 01:06:49.957
and ask him how he feels about that, huh?

01:06:49.959 --> 01:06:53.930
That was an intimidation
tactic, pure and simple.

01:06:56.066 --> 01:06:57.732
But I'm gonna do whatever's necessary

01:06:57.734 --> 01:06:59.770
to get ahold of that girl, you know that.

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:02.872
<i>She's gotta go.</i>

01:07:05.975 --> 01:07:07.508
You don't look the devil in the face

01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:09.546
without taking the ride
to the bottom floor.

01:07:11.113 --> 01:07:12.913
The devil?

01:07:12.915 --> 01:07:15.883
You really are fucked in
the head, you know that?

01:07:15.885 --> 01:07:18.788
Oh, so now I'm crazy, huh?

01:07:21.957 --> 01:07:23.993
Well, one of us must be.

01:07:35.004 --> 01:07:37.006
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

01:07:50.953 --> 01:07:52.722
Bird: <i>Carter.</i>

01:07:53.923 --> 01:07:56.860
<i>What? You okay?</i>

01:08:09.506 --> 01:08:10.540
What's the matter?

01:08:12.107 --> 01:08:15.044
I'm sorry I got you into this.

01:08:17.613 --> 01:08:19.750
Got me into this.

01:08:21.984 --> 01:08:23.487
Bird.

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:27.457
Hey. Hey.

01:08:29.024 --> 01:08:31.796
We were put together for a reason.

01:08:40.035 --> 01:08:41.805
Lucky.

01:08:56.285 --> 01:08:58.823
- <i>( car approaching )</i>

<i>( footsteps thudding )</i>

01:09:52.073 --> 01:09:54.144
What took you so long?

- <i>( thudding )</i>

Sade: <i>Hey, partner!</i>

01:10:06.355 --> 01:10:08.822
<i>Got somebody down here
who wants to talk to you.</i>

01:10:08.824 --> 01:10:10.293
<i>Go on, speak up, darling.</i>

01:10:13.696 --> 01:10:15.129
Woman: <i>Carter!</i>

01:10:15.131 --> 01:10:16.930
Mara!

01:10:16.932 --> 01:10:18.299
Sade: <i>Bingo!</i>

01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:20.268
Found her number in your phone.

01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:22.303
Gave her a call.

01:10:22.305 --> 01:10:25.206
Told her I was a friend of yours.

01:10:25.208 --> 01:10:28.142
That I was real worried about you.

01:10:28.144 --> 01:10:30.277
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:10:30.279 --> 01:10:31.979
<i>( chuckles )</i>

01:10:31.981 --> 01:10:33.814
<i>That you needed to see her bad,</i>

01:10:33.816 --> 01:10:36.149
<i>but you couldn't bring
yourself to make the call.</i>

01:10:36.151 --> 01:10:38.118
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.221
Being the close, loyal friend that I am.

01:10:41.223 --> 01:10:43.390
This poor woman drove
half the night to get here,

01:10:43.392 --> 01:10:45.259
ain't that right, ma'am?

01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:48.161
Carter, I'm sorry.

01:10:48.163 --> 01:10:50.764
He told me you were drinking.

01:10:50.766 --> 01:10:52.066
I was worried about you.

01:10:52.068 --> 01:10:53.401
- I'm sor...
- You hush now, hear?

01:10:53.403 --> 01:10:55.303
So, what's it gonna be, Sergeant Greene?

01:10:55.305 --> 01:10:57.104
<i>Looks like we got
our tiebreaker, huh?</i>

01:10:57.106 --> 01:10:59.273
If you fucking hurt her, man,

01:10:59.275 --> 01:11:01.408
I swear to fucking Christ

01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:03.111
you will never get this kid!

01:11:03.113 --> 01:11:05.278
- You understand?!
- <i>( chuckles )</i>

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.648
Somehow I doubt that, soldier boy.

01:11:07.650 --> 01:11:10.852
But besides, she ain't seen my face yet.

01:11:10.854 --> 01:11:13.020
- Have you, darling?
- ( sobs )

01:11:13.022 --> 01:11:15.089
Sade: <i>No.</i>

01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:17.425
<i>Just like our old friend
Jerry Baker. You remember him?</i>

01:11:17.427 --> 01:11:19.193
<i>That's right. If you don't
send the kid down here,</i>

01:11:19.195 --> 01:11:20.928
<i>she's gonna get the same thing.</i>

01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:22.964
This time, I'm not gonna be soft about it.

01:11:22.966 --> 01:11:24.765
You understand?

01:11:24.767 --> 01:11:27.434
I'm gonna do some real exploring.

01:11:27.436 --> 01:11:29.903
- ( sobs )
- Really open her up,

01:11:29.905 --> 01:11:32.005
see what she can do.

01:11:32.007 --> 01:11:33.808
<i>Now you get your mind right</i>

01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:35.910
<i>and you send the girl
down here with that film,</i>

01:11:35.912 --> 01:11:37.944
<i>and you can have your wife back</i>

01:11:37.946 --> 01:11:40.281
and y'all can get on back
to your happily ever after.

01:11:40.283 --> 01:11:41.983
How do I know I can trust you?

01:11:41.985 --> 01:11:43.751
You can't.

01:11:43.753 --> 01:11:45.853
But if she was my wife,

01:11:45.855 --> 01:11:48.089
I'd take the chance just the same.

01:11:48.091 --> 01:11:50.390
<i>And seeing as we're
here on your property,</i>

01:11:50.392 --> 01:11:52.193
<i>I'm gonna be real courteous</i>

01:11:52.195 --> 01:11:54.261
<i>and I'm gonna give you
to the count of five.</i>

01:11:54.263 --> 01:11:55.697
Carter?

01:11:55.699 --> 01:11:58.035
Sade: <i>Here we go.</i>

01:11:59.436 --> 01:12:01.969
Carter, you promised.

<i>Clock's ticking.</i>

Carter, please, you promised!

01:12:17.753 --> 01:12:19.953
- Four!
- You promised you wouldn't let him...

01:12:19.955 --> 01:12:21.859
Shh. Shut up.

- You take this.
- Sade: <i>Don't take too long!</i>

01:12:28.464 --> 01:12:30.230
He tries to come up them stairs,

01:12:30.232 --> 01:12:31.432
you shoot him.

01:12:31.434 --> 01:12:33.367
It'll knock you on your ass,

01:12:33.369 --> 01:12:36.103
but you'll hit him if you
aim down the stairs, okay?

01:12:36.105 --> 01:12:38.840
- It aims real wide.
- <i>Three!</i>

01:12:38.842 --> 01:12:40.444
What? No, what are you doing?

01:12:43.079 --> 01:12:44.748
I'm gonna go see my son.

01:12:47.316 --> 01:12:50.117

- Shh.

01:12:50.119 --> 01:12:51.421
<i>Two!</i>

01:12:53.989 --> 01:12:55.322
<i>Come on, Sergeant Greene!</i>

01:12:55.324 --> 01:12:57.060
- <i>Don't be stupid!</i>
- ( sobs )

01:12:59.128 --> 01:13:01.228
- All right, that's it. One!
- No!

01:13:01.230 --> 01:13:03.898
<i>All right! Okay.</i>

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.000
You made the right choice.

01:13:06.002 --> 01:13:08.301
I'm proud of you.

01:13:08.303 --> 01:13:10.203
Now you come on, you send her down,

01:13:10.205 --> 01:13:12.406
you can have your wife.

01:13:12.408 --> 01:13:15.079
<i>( glass crunches )</i>

<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:23.886
- Are you okay? ( gasps )
- Shh!

01:13:26.855 --> 01:13:29.991
Well, not that it ain't
nice to see your ugly mug,

01:13:29.993 --> 01:13:33.126
but what the fuck are you doing?

01:13:33.128 --> 01:13:34.929
I couldn't do it, man.

01:13:34.931 --> 01:13:36.831
I can't send that little girl down here.

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:39.233
I can see that! Where's the 20 gauge?

01:13:39.235 --> 01:13:40.867
She's got it.

01:13:40.869 --> 01:13:43.136
You want her?

01:13:43.138 --> 01:13:44.871
Go get her.

01:13:44.873 --> 01:13:47.175
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:13:47.177 --> 01:13:50.377
All she's gotta do is
aim down that stairwell

01:13:50.379 --> 01:13:52.212
and pull the fucking trigger, man.

01:13:52.214 --> 01:13:54.081
And you're drunk and you're slow.

01:13:54.083 --> 01:13:56.250
You'd be like shooting fish in a barrel.

01:13:56.252 --> 01:13:57.818
That's brilliant.

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:00.153
That's fucking brilliant, soldier boy.

01:14:00.155 --> 01:14:02.490
Just go home.

01:14:02.492 --> 01:14:05.827
- Go home to your daughter.
- I don't have a fucking daughter!

01:14:05.829 --> 01:14:09.130
- I fucking hate kids!
- What the fuck does it matter, man?

01:14:09.132 --> 01:14:11.432
- You win.
- You fucking coward!

01:14:11.434 --> 01:14:13.835
You didn't have the balls
to make the call, did you?

01:14:13.837 --> 01:14:17.071
<i>No! You gave up your
responsibility to the little girl.</i>

01:14:17.073 --> 01:14:19.105
And you came crawling down here

with your dick in your fucking hand

01:14:21.244 --> 01:14:23.877
to grovel like a dog for mercy?!

01:14:23.879 --> 01:14:25.912
Fuck you! I don't do mercy!

01:14:25.914 --> 01:14:27.615
I'm gonna do you both a favor

01:14:27.617 --> 01:14:30.350
- and end your miserable fucking lives...
- No, no, no, no.

01:14:30.352 --> 01:14:32.286
- ...right now!
- Hold on!

01:14:32.288 --> 01:14:34.087
Now come on, man!

01:14:34.089 --> 01:14:35.923
What the hell is that gonna solve, huh?

kill for pleasure.</i>

Huh? Have I been talking out my ass

all motherfucking day?!

01:14:44.367 --> 01:14:47.602
I'd have told you I had prostate cancer

01:14:47.604 --> 01:14:50.237
- if I thought it would help.
- We haven't seen your face...

01:14:50.239 --> 01:14:52.974
Oh, no? Well, here! Now you have.

01:14:52.976 --> 01:14:54.474

before I kill your brand-new daddy.

01:15:02.418 --> 01:15:03.984
No, Bird. No!

You stay! You stay!

01:15:06.355 --> 01:15:08.288
Your choice, princess.

01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:10.925
How many more people gotta die

01:15:10.927 --> 01:15:13.960
- because of you?
- She's just a kid, for Christ's sake.
