Hm! Ugh!

00:37.120 --> 00:39.440
Moon, can you please stop
bouncing so much?

00:39.680 --> 00:41.280
But <i>I </i> want to jump rope!

00:41.480 --> 00:42.960
But <i>I </i> want to do a puzzle!

00:43.160 --> 00:44.360
Shh! You two!

00:44.559 --> 00:47.480
I need to concentrate
on my cooking!

00:47.680 --> 00:49.559
Like so many folks
around the world,

00:49.760 --> 00:52.879
I love celebrating
Chinese New Year.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.680
But Pawpaw, I want
to play something new,

00:55.879 --> 00:57.279
and Ollie doesn't!

00:57.480 --> 01:00.120
Because jumping rope makes
my tummy go all...

01:00.320 --> 01:02.040
Blbblbblbbbb!

01:02.239 --> 01:04.720
Can we <i>please </i>play something
that doesn't bounce?

01:05.280 --> 01:07.480
Why don't you try taking turns?

01:07.679 --> 01:08.840
Eh, quietly...

01:09.039 --> 01:10.039
OK?

01:12.039 --> 01:14.640
OK! I'll go first.
And I choose jumping rope.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.520
But why do <i>you</i>
get to go first?

01:16.720 --> 01:19.039
<i>-I </i>want to go first!
-You went first last time!

01:19.240 --> 01:20.759
-[Ollie] Did not!
-[Moon] Did too!

01:20.960 --> 01:22.160
-[Ollie] Did not!
-[Moon] Did too!

01:22.360 --> 01:24.080
Oh alright, you two.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.320
Now, I'm having a brainstorm.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.320
-Not you too...
-It runs in the family.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.560
You can play scavenger hunt!

01:31.679 --> 01:32.520
Woah.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.479
Scavenger hunt? What's that?

01:34.679 --> 01:36.759
A crazy list of stuff
we have to find

01:36.960 --> 01:38.160
before time runs out.

01:38.399 --> 01:39.720
That's right.

01:39.839 --> 01:42.320
And if you can find <i>all</i>
the things on this list

01:42.520 --> 01:43.520
by suppertime,

01:43.880 --> 01:46.240
you get a special surprise

01:46.440 --> 01:48.759
for Chinese New Year dessert!

01:48.880 --> 01:50.920
[gasps] Special surprise?

01:51.119 --> 01:53.559
Ooo! Your grandpa
always has the <i>best</i>

01:53.759 --> 01:55.520
special dessert surprises!

01:55.880 --> 01:58.119
Great! So have fun in China.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.399
-China?
-What?

01:59.600 --> 02:01.119
-Why there?
-It's so far away.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.800
You can find all the things

02:03.000 --> 02:05.320
for our Chinese
New Year party there.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.960
And now remember... Take turns!

02:16.359 --> 02:17.720
Wheee!

02:25.359 --> 02:29.640
<i>Now arriving in China! Yay!</i>

02:32.840 --> 02:35.640
OK, Moon,
let's see what's on our list!

02:35.920 --> 02:38.600
[Ollie] A lantern, chopsticks,
noisemakers,

02:38.799 --> 02:40.959
party hats, party decorations

02:41.079 --> 02:42.680
and a postcard
of the Great Wall.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.840
And we have to get it all
by suppertime.

02:45.160 --> 02:48.040
We better get started
taking turns like Pawpaw said.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.760
OK. Let's do
the rock-paper-scissors game

02:50.959 --> 02:52.320
to decide who goes first.

02:52.519 --> 02:54.720
Ready? One, two, three...

02:56.079 --> 02:58.040
Scissors cut paper, so I win!

02:58.239 --> 03:00.000
I get to find the first item.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.160
A lantern! This way!

03:06.079 --> 03:07.359
A bus?

03:07.560 --> 03:09.239
The train is nicer.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.799
But it's <i>my </i>turn
and I want to take the bus.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.720
And when it's <i>your </i>turn,

03:13.920 --> 03:16.000
we can go however you want.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.200
You know...

03:23.320 --> 03:25.280
trains are also roomier!

03:25.399 --> 03:26.840
Ugh!

03:27.040 --> 03:28.720
Uh huh, we'll see.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.799
When it's your turn in the game.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.959
Are you playing a game?
Is that the list for it?

03:33.120 --> 03:33.959
I'm great at games.

03:34.399 --> 03:36.320
I'm our village game champion.
I never lose.

03:36.519 --> 03:37.880
I'm Qi!

03:38.200 --> 03:40.280
Amazing, Qi!
We're Ollie and Moon.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.000
We're on a scavenger hunt.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.440
Really? I've never won
a scavenger hunt.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.440
I've never even gone on one!
Could I play too?

03:47.959 --> 03:49.440
[Qi]
I have a lantern you can have.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.200
We'll get off at the next stop,
OK? OK!

03:52.399 --> 03:54.720
See? Taking the bus
has turned out great.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.959
[honking horn]

03:56.160 --> 03:57.760
[Ollie] Trains are also...

03:57.880 --> 04:00.399
a lot less bumpy...

04:06.000 --> 04:07.440
I'll be right back, OK? OK!

04:07.560 --> 04:10.000
Thanks, Qi!
Isn't he great, Ollie?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.440
The way he sort of just
leaps in and...

04:12.640 --> 04:13.920
takes charge!

04:14.399 --> 04:15.839
-Ollie?
-OK...

04:17.000 --> 04:18.120
My turn.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.640
Your turn? But we don't have
the lantern yet.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.840
So I still have a few minutes
of my turn left.

04:24.039 --> 04:26.000
Ohh I love it when it's my turn.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.479
Moon, on your turn,

04:27.680 --> 04:29.159
you picked a rumbly,

04:29.360 --> 04:30.280
tummy-joggling bus.

04:30.479 --> 04:31.840
I picked it fair and square.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.880
Yeah, but now I feel woozy.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.240
So, for my turn,

04:35.440 --> 04:37.840
I pick some tummy-soothing...

04:38.039 --> 04:39.000
noodle soup.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.640
But my turn isn't over yet!

04:40.840 --> 04:42.360
-Here's the lantern.
-[sighs]

04:42.560 --> 04:44.200
OK, now it's over.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.479
Thanks, Qi.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.960
So, what do you have to find
on your turn?

04:50.599 --> 04:51.479
Chop...

04:51.599 --> 04:52.440
...sticks.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.560
Chopsticks?

04:53.760 --> 04:55.479
Look! They come with your soup!

04:55.680 --> 04:57.800
Two things found already!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.640
We're so going
to win this thing.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.320
Let's hurry
and find the next one.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.520
The next one is mine,

05:02.719 --> 05:04.760
and for my turn,
I get to find...

05:04.960 --> 05:05.919
Not yet.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.000
We're still on <i>my </i>turn.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.800
But you found the chopsticks!

05:10.000 --> 05:11.240
Your turn is over.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.200
No. I'm still having my soup.

05:14.719 --> 05:17.159
So it's technically still my...

05:18.240 --> 05:19.039
turn.

05:19.520 --> 05:20.400
Hmm...

05:20.520 --> 05:22.400
Since this could take a while...

05:22.760 --> 05:26.039
maybe I could see the list
and play some more?

05:28.080 --> 05:29.880
Chinese noisemakers...

05:30.080 --> 05:31.919
Oh! I know where to find those!

05:33.039 --> 05:35.039
You're taking too long, Ollie!

05:35.240 --> 05:36.719
You're doing this on purpose!

05:36.919 --> 05:40.120
I'm enjoying my turn.
The way you...

05:40.320 --> 05:41.560
enjoyed yours.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.680
OK! Your turn.

05:45.880 --> 05:46.800
Finally.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.840
Next on the list is... Wait.

05:48.960 --> 05:49.880
Where's the list?

05:50.080 --> 05:51.080
Good news!

05:51.280 --> 05:53.120
I found
the Chinese noisemakers.

05:54.039 --> 05:55.560
Bad news...

05:55.760 --> 05:58.840
I accidentally dropped the list
and, well...

05:59.440 --> 06:01.159
now he has it.

06:01.359 --> 06:02.919
[bird chirps]

06:03.120 --> 06:05.400
I let the team down. I'm sorry.

06:05.599 --> 06:06.680
It's OK.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.479
You were just trying to help.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.760
Now we really
need to get that list back.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.400
And since it's my turn,

06:12.599 --> 06:15.440
I say we make silly faces,
so the bird laughs

06:15.640 --> 06:17.520
and drops the list.

06:17.719 --> 06:18.640
Blah blah blah!

06:18.840 --> 06:20.080
Bloog bloog bloog!

06:22.919 --> 06:24.359
[funny noises]

06:26.799 --> 06:27.960
[funny noises]

06:28.640 --> 06:30.359
[sigh]

06:30.560 --> 06:31.960
Is it my turn yet?

06:32.080 --> 06:32.960
I guess.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.320
There's no way this bird
will stay awake

06:35.520 --> 06:37.120
while I read this.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.000
And when it falls asleep,
we grab the list.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.960
But, that'll take forever!

06:42.080 --> 06:42.919
Yup.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.479
But it's my turn.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.640
Page one...

06:45.760 --> 06:46.960
"Insert tab A

06:47.240 --> 06:48.840
into slot C.

06:49.039 --> 06:50.760
Fold D into B.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.719
Paste E to tab C.

06:53.320 --> 06:55.159
Assemble flap L underneath,

06:55.359 --> 06:56.680
[Ollie] take apart again..."

06:56.799 --> 06:57.680
[snores]

06:57.799 --> 06:59.159
[yawning] "Realize...

06:59.359 --> 07:01.280
tab six was actually tab nine..."

07:01.479 --> 07:03.599
[birds chirping]

07:05.320 --> 07:06.240
Ahh!

07:06.440 --> 07:08.440
We fell asleep! What time is it?

07:08.640 --> 07:10.080
[gasps] Ahh!

07:10.280 --> 07:13.039
It's getting close
to suppertime!

07:13.200 --> 07:14.039
The list!

07:14.239 --> 07:15.599
Yay! We did it!

07:15.719 --> 07:17.080
OK, guys, it looks like

07:17.200 --> 07:19.159
we still have
to find some party hats,

07:19.359 --> 07:22.359
party decorations and a postcard
from the Great Wall.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.919
We'll never have enough time
to find all that now.

07:25.039 --> 07:26.080
Sure we will.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.880
I'm the village game champion!

07:28.000 --> 07:30.120
There's no way I'll lose
after all this.

07:30.239 --> 07:32.799
I can find the party hats
and decorations. No problem!

07:33.000 --> 07:35.200
Then that only leaves
the postcard.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.120
Meet you at the Great Wall,
team, to celebrate! OK? OK!

07:38.320 --> 07:39.400
There's no time to lose.

07:39.599 --> 07:41.479
And since it's <i>my </i>turn...

07:42.159 --> 07:43.000
Bikes!

07:43.200 --> 07:44.239
But Moon...

07:44.599 --> 07:47.599
My tummy's had enough
blbblbblbbbb today.

07:47.799 --> 07:49.320
Cycling's faster, Ollie.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.880
Plus, it's <i>my </i>turn.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.239
[Ollie] Uh, uh, uh...

07:56.159 --> 07:57.640
The Great Wall!

07:58.120 --> 08:00.080
Ahhh oof!

08:00.719 --> 08:03.200
Hmm. No bicycles allowed.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.840
We have to walk from here.

08:05.039 --> 08:06.520
But it's still my turn!

08:06.640 --> 08:07.479
Uh uh.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.159
I have to rest.

08:09.359 --> 08:11.599
But we don't have time to rest!

08:11.799 --> 08:13.760
Good thing
I'm having a brainstorm!

08:15.840 --> 08:17.400
At least...

08:17.599 --> 08:19.280
my tummy's...

08:19.479 --> 08:21.880
O-K-K...

08:24.960 --> 08:28.440
[short breaths]

08:28.840 --> 08:30.320
[Moon] It never...

08:30.440 --> 08:32.039
[Moon] stops...

08:32.159 --> 08:34.720
I guess
that's why they call it great!

08:35.000 --> 08:37.480
A just good wall
would have stopped by now.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.559
Where do you
even get a postcard?

08:39.760 --> 08:41.360
We're almost out of time.

08:41.559 --> 08:43.480
We really messed this up,
didn't we?

08:43.679 --> 08:44.520
I know.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.199
All I cared about was getting
to do what I wanted

08:47.319 --> 08:48.760
when it was my turn.

08:48.959 --> 08:50.959
I didn't think of you at all.

08:51.079 --> 08:52.240
Me either.

08:52.439 --> 08:54.160
If we just worked as a team,

08:54.439 --> 08:56.360
like Qi was trying to do,

08:56.560 --> 08:57.840
we'd be done by now!

08:57.959 --> 09:00.600
-Having dessert with Pawpaw.
-Having dessert with Pawpaw.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.240
Isn't the Great Wall of China
incredible?

09:06.640 --> 09:10.880
Did you know it's nearly
5,500 miles long?

09:11.240 --> 09:14.319
Well, I'm off to the gift shop.
Bye.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.199
There's a gift shop?

09:16.400 --> 09:17.280
With postcards?

09:17.480 --> 09:18.400
How do we get there?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.079
That depends...

09:20.280 --> 09:24.199
Do you like exciting
cable-car rides high in the sky?

09:24.400 --> 09:28.360
Or long, slow safe walks
down lots of stairs?

09:28.560 --> 09:29.680
Ugh.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.920
Or would you rather compromise

09:32.120 --> 09:35.400
with a ride that's kind of fast
and pretty smooth?

09:35.600 --> 09:37.240
