Hi, Michelle.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.767
Nap.

00:16.809 --> 00:19.060
You woke me up to tell

00:16.809 --> 00:19.060
me I'm taking a nap?

00:19.102 --> 00:21.355
Yeah.

00:21.396 --> 00:22.773
Well, thank you.

00:22.815 --> 00:24.399
Well, If I fall

00:22.815 --> 00:24.399
asleep again make sure

00:24.441 --> 00:26.067
you wake me up

00:24.441 --> 00:26.067

Michelle, look at this.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.560
What is this?

02:23.602 --> 02:25.854
- Chickie.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.854
- It's a chickie?

02:25.896 --> 02:27.564
Pet the chickie.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.564
Pet it.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.274
Oh, yeah,

02:27.606 --> 02:29.274
give the chickie a kiss.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.570
- The chickie's nice.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.570
- Yeah.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.031
Give the chickie love.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.031
Give him a hug.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.616
Oh, that's nice.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.202
Pet the chickie.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.202
Pet him.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.917
Pet him.

02:46.959 --> 02:48.836
Oh, this is a great picture.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.921
I gotta get this.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.921
Say, "Cheese."

02:50.963 --> 02:53.340
- Cheese.

Ah, here.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.758

- So pretty, okay.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.885
- Here, you hold her.

- Wanna take another picture?

- Here we go.

- Okay.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.692
What are you doing here anyway?

03:11.733 --> 03:13.652
Well, it's Saturday and

03:11.733 --> 03:13.652

03:22.243 --> 03:25.664
I'm not laughing so that

03:22.243 --> 03:25.664
pretty much answers my question.

No, Danny, you look cute.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.720
let's go look at the horse.

03:39.761 --> 03:43.264
Isn't he the most gorgeous

03:39.761 --> 03:43.264

03:43.306 --> 03:45.059
No, Patrick Swayze is.

Oh, look at

03:46.560 --> 03:48.854
the pretty horse.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.815
- What's his name?

03:48.896 --> 03:51.815
- Rocket.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.067
Hello, Rocket.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.902
(Joey)

03:53.108 --> 03:54.902
'Hello, Stephanie.'

03:56.361 --> 03:58.113
I beg your pardon?

03:58.155 --> 04:01.324
(Joey)

03:58.155 --> 04:01.324
'I said,

03:58.155 --> 04:01.324
hello, Stephanie.'

04:01.366 --> 04:02.868
He talks!

04:02.910 --> 04:04.953
The horse talks!

04:04.995 --> 04:07.330
And he knows my name.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.499
Stephanie, it's Joey.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.501
There's no Joey here.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.254
Ah, pay no attention

04:12.920 --> 04:14.254
to that man

04:14.295 --> 04:15.589
whose lips are moving.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.217
That is not funny.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.302
I'm never gonna trust

04:18.258 --> 04:21.302
another talking horse.

04:22.387 --> 04:23.680
Steph, I'll make it

04:22.387 --> 04:23.680
up to you.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.140
Hey, I'll show you

04:23.722 --> 04:25.140
a duck here that

04:25.182 --> 04:26.934
sounds just like Elmer Fudd.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.727
He goes, "Quack, quack, quack."

04:29.186 --> 04:30.270
"Hello."

04:33.982 --> 04:35.483
Looks like that horse

04:35.525 --> 04:38.112
has taken a shine to you.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.780
Old Rocket's been

04:38.153 --> 04:39.780
a little lonely

04:39.821 --> 04:42.407
since his owner

04:39.821 --> 04:42.407
moved to Chicago.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.992
What's gonna happen to him?

04:44.034 --> 04:45.493
The fact is, I'm supposed to

04:45.535 --> 04:47.287
find him a good home.

04:47.328 --> 04:50.165
Somebody could have

04:47.328 --> 04:50.165
themselves a free horse.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.084
A free horse?

04:50.207 --> 04:52.084
No money?

04:52.126 --> 04:53.334
Zero dollars?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.545
An absolutely

04:53.376 --> 04:55.545
free horse?

04:56.880 --> 04:59.091
I might be interested.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.759
Not so fast, honey.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.053
It cost $100 every two weeks

05:03.095 --> 05:04.554
to feed and stable him.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.306
A hundred dollars?

05:06.347 --> 05:07.975
Ah, I'll get

05:06.347 --> 05:07.975
back to you.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.768
Just put the horse

05:08.016 --> 05:09.768
on layaway.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.688
Kimmy, a horse

05:11.770 --> 05:13.688
of my very own.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.024
My dream come true.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.358
Let's do this together.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.319
We'll be the only kids

05:17.400 --> 05:19.319
in the sixth grade

05:19.360 --> 05:20.862
with a real horse.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.198
Oooh, that'll make

05:20.904 --> 05:23.198
Kathy Santoni

05:23.240 --> 05:25.408
shut up about

05:23.240 --> 05:25.408
her stupid moped.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.161
We'll get our parents

05:25.450 --> 05:27.161
to split the money.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.830
I'll go ask my dad

05:27.202 --> 05:29.830
right now. Dad.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.249
Dad, can I have a pet?

05:29.871 --> 05:32.249
I'll feed it.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.960
I'll take care of it.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.960
I'll be totally responsible.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.671
Honey, a pet is

05:35.002 --> 05:37.671
a big responsibility.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.464
I just covered that.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.925
Well, I don't know.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.925
Maybe something small.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.636
Like a parakeet or a goldfish.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.636
Nothing with teeth.

05:46.387 --> 05:47.889
Danny, we're on.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.142
That's my dad.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.142

of Wake Up San

05:56.231 --> 05:58.233
- I'm Danny Tanner.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.233
- I'm Rebecca Donaldson.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.568
And today we're live

05:58.275 --> 06:00.568
from Golden Gate Stables.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.778
Danny, isn't this wonderful?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.697
It reminds me of growing up

06:01.820 --> 06:03.697
in Nebraska.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.866
Reminds me of a rerun

06:03.738 --> 06:05.866
of "Green Acres."

06:05.907 --> 06:08.827
You know, sometimes I really

06:05.907 --> 06:08.827
miss farm life but not today

06:08.869 --> 06:12.122
because I have a special

06:08.869 --> 06:12.122
4-H kind of surprise for you.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.665
Rebecca, I don't

06:12.164 --> 06:13.665
like surprises.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.001
- I know.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.001
- Come on, honey.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.752
Come on, Marilyn.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.213
Hi, goat.

06:20.839 --> 06:21.965
Surprise!

06:22.007 --> 06:23.466
San Francisco's gonna

06:22.007 --> 06:23.466
watch you learn

06:23.508 --> 06:24.801
how to milk a goat.

06:26.678 --> 06:30.349
Now, you sit down

06:26.678 --> 06:30.349
right here.

06:30.389 --> 06:33.685
Watch out, honey.

06:30.389 --> 06:33.685
And grab on right under there.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.437
Rebecca, I have a thing about

06:33.727 --> 06:36.437
touching goats below the waist.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.399
Come on, it's easy.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.399
Like this.

06:40.441 --> 06:41.735
Come on, honey.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.072
Now, you try it.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.953
Hi, Marilyn...Danny Tanner.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.958
Kids, don't try this

06:55.249 --> 06:56.958
at home.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.260
Well, I asked my mom

07:04.341 --> 07:06.260
about the horse.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.387
- What did she say?

07:06.301 --> 07:08.387
- She said.

07:08.427 --> 07:09.804
"Kimberly Louise Gibbler

07:09.846 --> 07:12.349
have you lost your mind?"

07:12.391 --> 07:15.769
I didn't really have

07:12.391 --> 07:15.769
an answer for that.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.021
Did you try asking

07:15.810 --> 07:18.021
your dad again?

07:18.063 --> 07:20.440
No, I have a better idea.

07:20.481 --> 07:23.735
If we take care of Rocket

07:20.481 --> 07:23.735
all by ourselves for two weeks

07:23.777 --> 07:26.321
our parents will be impressed,

07:23.777 --> 07:26.321
they'll have to let us keep him.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.783
I love the way

07:26.363 --> 07:29.783
your mind works.

07:29.824 --> 07:34.662
How does your mind say we pay

07:29.824 --> 07:34.662
for two weeks of stable fees?

07:34.704 --> 07:38.208
My mind says if we

07:34.704 --> 07:38.208
take our allowance

07:38.250 --> 07:41.211
and all our savings,

07:38.250 --> 07:41.211
we'll have just enough money.

07:41.253 --> 07:45.215
Yeah! All I have to do

07:41.253 --> 07:45.215
is give up shopping.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.842
Give up shopping?

07:47.884 --> 07:49.844
Did those words

07:47.884 --> 07:49.844
come out of my mouth?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.973
Kimmy, how can you

07:50.971 --> 07:52.973
compare shopping

07:53.014 --> 07:55.516
to having our very own horse?

07:55.558 --> 07:56.851
Come on, say it with me.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.645
We're gonna get a horse.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.521
- We're gonna get a horse.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.065
- We're gonna get a horse.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.900
- We're gonna get a horse.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.568
We're gonna get a horse.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.696
Stephanie, you didn't

08:06.945 --> 08:08.696
hear that.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.990
Of course, I did.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.699
We're gonna get a horse!

08:11.741 --> 08:12.909
See, I heard it.

08:14.453 --> 08:17.038
Uh, tell you what.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.000
If you can keep the horse

08:17.080 --> 08:20.000
a secret for two weeks

08:20.041 --> 08:21.376
I'll let you own

08:20.041 --> 08:21.376
part of the horse.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.585
Which part?

08:27.799 --> 08:30.093
Uh, the tail.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.095
My very own tail?

08:33.180 --> 08:34.473
Deal.

08:36.141 --> 08:38.435
I think I'll name

08:36.141 --> 08:38.435
it Buttercup.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.272
Are you sure

08:40.603 --> 08:42.272
you can trust her?

08:42.314 --> 08:44.316
She is such a blabbermouth.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.942
I can keep a secret.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.111
No one knows about

08:45.984 --> 08:48.111
the bag of Halloween

08:48.153 --> 08:49.654
candy in my sock drawer.

08:51.990 --> 08:55.952
I am a blabbermouth.

08:51.990 --> 08:55.952
Ay-ay-aye.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.997
- Halloween candy.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.957
- Give it to me!

08:59.039 --> 09:00.957
- I want it!

09:00.999 --> 09:02.667
Wait!

09:00.999 --> 09:02.667
It's not in there anymore.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.545
It's stale.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.545
It'll rot your teeth.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.172
Okay, Michelle,

09:05.586 --> 09:07.172
you ready to go for a ride

09:07.214 --> 09:09.299
in your brand-new car?

09:09.341 --> 09:10.550
Okay, here we go.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.968
Fasten your seat belt.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.136
Okay, Michelle

09:13.178 --> 09:14.971
let's burn rubber.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.971
Ready?

09:15.013 --> 09:16.139
Beep the horn.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.603
Vroom, vroom..

09:25.648 --> 09:27.108
Argh, look out!

09:29.027 --> 09:30.862
Hey, bum, out of my way.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.366
You ready for

09:32.447 --> 09:34.366
your nap, Michelle?

09:34.408 --> 09:35.534
Hey, bum.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.622
You gotta be careful what you

09:38.578 --> 09:41.622
say in front of these kids.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.500
Michelle, look at this.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.500
We got you a toy.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.793
We got you a toy, now, you take

09:43.542 --> 09:45.793
a nap, by the time you're done

09:45.835 --> 09:48.338
we'll have it all blown

09:45.835 --> 09:48.338
up for you, okay?

09:51.841 --> 09:54.219
She better sleep

09:51.841 --> 09:54.219
for a month.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.845
- Hope so. See you.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.845
- See you.

09:55.887 --> 09:58.223
You and Joey are

09:55.887 --> 09:58.223
gonna be great parents.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.724
You guys should have

09:58.265 --> 09:59.724
kids of your own.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.935
We've talked about it.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.062
Actually, neither one of us

10:01.976 --> 10:04.062
is willing to go through labor.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.693
You need some

10:08.900 --> 10:10.693
help with that?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.070
No, I can take

10:10.735 --> 10:12.070
care of this.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.613
It's a man's job.

10:13.654 --> 10:14.906
Alright, well,

10:13.654 --> 10:14.906
in that case

10:14.948 --> 10:16.491
I'm gonna get

10:14.948 --> 10:16.491
back to the studio.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.826
No, wait! Don't go yet.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.826
I'm gonna faint.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.539
You know, I really had

10:20.495 --> 10:22.539
a great time with you today.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.125
So did I.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.125
Listen, Becky, can I ask you

10:25.166 --> 10:27.335
a personal question?

10:27.377 --> 10:29.212
- Sure.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.212
- Do you eat dinner?

10:30.922 --> 10:32.215
Almost every night.

10:32.257 --> 10:35.260
This is amazing!

10:32.257 --> 10:35.260
So do I.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.721
Two people, both dinner-eaters.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.721
How often does that happen?

10:38.763 --> 10:40.348
Becky, have dinner with

10:38.763 --> 10:40.348
me tonight, please?

10:40.390 --> 10:43.893
I can't tonight.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.893
I have to work on Monday's show.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.395
- It's the weekend.

10:43.935 --> 10:45.395
- Oh, I know.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.981
But this job is a big

10:45.437 --> 10:47.981
opportunity for me

10:48.022 --> 10:49.566
and I really have to

10:48.022 --> 10:49.566
stay focused.

10:49.608 --> 10:50.984
Alright, take an hour

10:51.025 --> 10:52.693
and focus on

10:51.025 --> 10:52.693
some pasta fazool.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.696
Don't misunderstand.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.699
I really like having

10:55.738 --> 10:58.699
you as a friend.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.327
Besides, it's gonna

10:58.741 --> 11:00.327
take you all weekend

11:00.368 --> 11:02.078
to blow up Godzilla.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.746
- Bye.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.502
What am I doing wrong?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.502
Am I scaring her off?

11:09.628 --> 11:10.920
It's you.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.048
Alright, I'll have

11:12.422 --> 11:14.048
dinner with you.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.301
Come on, let's go eat Tokyo.

11:22.265 --> 11:25.018
Rocket, we're gonna

11:22.265 --> 11:25.018
take such good care of you.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.645
You wanna ride him first?

11:26.685 --> 11:27.854
You mean get on him?

11:29.564 --> 11:30.815
In my new outfit?

11:32.150 --> 11:33.234
Ew.

11:34.735 --> 11:36.779
Why don't I just go tell

11:34.735 --> 11:36.779
everybody in school

11:36.821 --> 11:39.157
we got a horse?

11:36.821 --> 11:39.157
Later, partner.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.162
Rocket, let's go

11:40.950 --> 11:44.162
for a nice long ride.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.581
And I'll try to

11:44.204 --> 11:46.581
explain Kimmy to you.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.130
Rocket, these

12:34.879 --> 12:36.130
have been the best

12:36.172 --> 12:38.216
two weeks of my life.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.635
You're the best horse

12:38.258 --> 12:40.635
I've ever owned.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.387
And I'm not just saying that

12:40.677 --> 12:42.387
because you're the only

12:42.429 --> 12:43.804
horse I've ever owned.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.849
If I owned a hundred horses

12:46.891 --> 12:48.393
you'd always be my favorite.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.354
Hi, D.J.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.354
Hi, Rocket.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.731
Kimmy, where have

12:51.396 --> 12:52.731
you been?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.482
I need your $50.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.026
- Has it been two weeks already?

12:54.524 --> 12:57.026
- Uh, huh.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.112
Fifty dollars, Kimmy.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.030
Do you like my new

12:59.153 --> 13:01.030
shirt and new boots?

13:01.072 --> 13:02.449
Yeah, they're really nice.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.871
- Oh, Kimmy, you didn't.

13:05.159 --> 13:08.871
- I did.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.915
You went to the mall?

13:10.957 --> 13:14.252
I don't even know

13:10.957 --> 13:14.252
how I got there.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.714
I tried to leave, but then I saw

13:14.294 --> 13:17.714
this shirt and these boots--

13:17.756 --> 13:20.258
Gibbler, you're

13:17.756 --> 13:20.258
a mall-aholic.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.305
I'm sorry

13:22.927 --> 13:25.305
I spent the money.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.889
I'm sorry I let you down.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.350
I'm not ready for this

13:26.931 --> 13:29.350
responsibility yet.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.019
Bye, D.J.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.354
Bye, Rocket.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.651
Hi, kiddo.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.986
Something wrong, dumpling?

13:40.027 --> 13:42.322
My friend wimped

13:40.027 --> 13:42.322
out on me.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.366
- I only have $50.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.366
- Oh.

13:45.408 --> 13:49.078
Well, now, that leaves

13:45.408 --> 13:49.078
you about $50 short.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.539
Now, if you can't afford

13:49.120 --> 13:51.539
to take care of the horse

13:51.581 --> 13:53.374
I gotta find

13:51.581 --> 13:53.374
someone who can.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.669
Well, wait.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.669
Let me check my backpack.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.672
I have a hairbrush.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.716
A math book that's

13:58.713 --> 14:01.716
never been used.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.886
Oh, wait, something

14:02.925 --> 14:05.886
better than cash.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.388
A George Michael CD.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.479
Either that boy's

14:11.017 --> 14:14.479
wearing an earring..

14:14.521 --> 14:17.190
...or that gal's got

14:14.521 --> 14:17.190
some serious stubble.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.986
I'm sorry, honey,

14:20.109 --> 14:21.986
I gotta have cash.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.280
I gotta go tell

14:22.028 --> 14:24.280
the boss that he's gotta

14:24.322 --> 14:26.032
find a new owner

14:24.322 --> 14:26.032
for Rocket.

14:26.073 --> 14:27.283
Well, wait.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.577
Can I just take him

14:27.325 --> 14:29.577
for one last ride?

14:29.619 --> 14:32.622
No harm in that.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.622
I'll be back.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.212
Don't worry, Rocket.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.212
I'll think of something.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.798
Nobody's ever gonna

14:39.253 --> 14:41.798
take you away from me.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.227
- I win.

14:51.683 --> 14:54.227
- I let you win.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.979
I let you let me win.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.481
Got it, chief.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.441
Would you like anything

14:58.523 --> 15:00.441
to eat, Harry?

15:00.483 --> 15:02.151
Let's see..

15:02.193 --> 15:05.238
I'll have a steak,

15:02.193 --> 15:05.238
medium-rare.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.865
We're out of steak.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.991
I'll make you my specialty

15:09.033 --> 15:10.451
cheese doughnuts.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.748
- How do you make that?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.748
- Simple.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.880
See, cheese doughnuts.

15:23.005 --> 15:25.425
Wow, where'd you

15:23.005 --> 15:25.425
learn to cook?

15:25.466 --> 15:27.385
Hello, rug rats.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.220
Steph, Go see if D.J.'s

15:27.427 --> 15:29.220
home so she can help me

15:29.262 --> 15:30.805
unpack these

15:29.262 --> 15:30.805
groceries, okay?

15:30.847 --> 15:32.348
Come on, let's go see.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.350
Oh, good,

15:32.390 --> 15:34.350
cheese doughnuts.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.522
- Whoa!

15:39.564 --> 15:40.815
Buttercup!

15:42.776 --> 15:45.528
Wow, a horse

15:42.776 --> 15:45.528
in the living room!

15:45.570 --> 15:48.155
I'm not even allowed to

15:45.570 --> 15:48.155
eat in my living room.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.076
I'm gonna go home and

15:49.490 --> 15:52.076
ask if I can sleepover.

15:54.078 --> 15:57.373
D.J., are Rocket and

15:54.078 --> 15:57.373
Buttercup gonna live with us?

15:57.415 --> 15:59.333
No. I came in

15:57.415 --> 15:59.333
to get Rocket

15:59.375 --> 16:01.753
a carrot and he

15:59.375 --> 16:01.753
followed me in.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.630
I gotta get him out

16:01.795 --> 16:03.630
to the backyard.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.214
Why'd you bring him here?

16:05.256 --> 16:07.926
I didn't have enough

16:05.256 --> 16:07.926
money for stable fees.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.678
Once dad sees Rocket, I know

16:10.720 --> 16:12.012
he'll fall in love with him.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.515
But he won't love

16:12.054 --> 16:14.515
him in the house.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.476
I gotta get him out

16:14.557 --> 16:16.476
to the backyard.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.561
Uncle Jesse's in the kitchen.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.606
- We're dead.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.606
- Don't get me in trouble.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.899
Hide the tail.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.654
I'll get him out.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.654
You get Uncle Jesse upstairs.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.197
And don't say a word

16:27.695 --> 16:30.197
about the horse.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.991
Who'd believe me?

16:33.952 --> 16:37.580
Hey, Uncle Jesse,

16:33.952 --> 16:37.580
since daddy's not home

16:37.622 --> 16:40.124
wanna go upstairs and

16:37.622 --> 16:40.124
jump on his bed, huh?

16:40.166 --> 16:41.751
Sound like fun?

16:41.793 --> 16:43.711
[horse neighing]

16:46.339 --> 16:48.007
What was that?

16:48.048 --> 16:50.718
D.J., she's watching Mr. Ed.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.975
Sounds so real,

16:54.931 --> 16:56.975
doesn't it?

16:58.392 --> 16:59.602
Too real.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.027
How did..

17:08.068 --> 17:09.863
Where did you..

17:09.904 --> 17:13.032
How?

17:09.904 --> 17:13.032
Help me out here.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.408
I can explain.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.577
Don't tell me.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.577
You're walking by the store

17:16.619 --> 17:20.206
and some kid had a litter of

17:16.619 --> 17:20.206
these in a cardboard box.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.834
Joey!

17:22.876 --> 17:25.378
Jess, I am trying

17:22.876 --> 17:25.378
to put the baby to..

17:25.419 --> 17:27.046
Horse.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.674
How did you..

17:29.716 --> 17:31.968
Where did you..

17:29.716 --> 17:31.968
How did it..

17:32.010 --> 17:34.554

17:34.595 --> 17:36.764
Oh, this is great,

17:34.595 --> 17:36.764
Danny's gonna walk in here

17:36.806 --> 17:38.599
see this horse and blame

17:36.806 --> 17:38.599
me for the whole thing.

17:38.641 --> 17:41.394
You know why?

17:38.641 --> 17:41.394
Because this is very funny.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.687
[laughing]

17:42.729 --> 17:43.688
Help me.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.731
I gotta get Rocket outside

17:44.772 --> 17:46.816
before dad comes home.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.527
- Just keep a lookout for dad.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.527
- Okay.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.196
Danny's gonna flip his gourd.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.196
We gotta get him out of here.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.907
- How do we get him out?

17:52.238 --> 17:53.907
- We'll feed him.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.659
- What does he eat?

17:53.948 --> 17:56.659
- Hay.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.160
We don't have any hay.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.412
Jess, you went to the market

17:59.453 --> 18:01.121
and you didn't

17:59.453 --> 18:01.121
pick up any hay?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.543
Daddy's coming home.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.588
Guys, please.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.588
I'm begging you. Help me.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.923
Jess, I got a plan.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.550
Follow my lead and agree

18:09.964 --> 18:12.550
with everything I say.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.927
- Okay.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.927
- Come on.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.094
Act natural.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.557
- Hi, guys.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.557
- Hi, Danny.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.809
We got a big surprise for you.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.809
Right, Jess?

18:21.851 --> 18:24.103
It's big.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.439
Yeah, it's in the kitchen,

18:24.144 --> 18:26.439
so close your eyes.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.982
Right, close your eyes.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.275
Close your eyes.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.193
Here we go.

18:31.235 --> 18:34.321
Wait.

18:31.235 --> 18:34.321
I know what the surprise is.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.658
Joey , you're making

18:34.363 --> 18:37.658
that chili again.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.368
- No. Better than that.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.368
- Watch the steps.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.412
- You are gonna love this.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.412
- Keep them closed.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.830
Keep them closed.

18:48.502 --> 18:49.963
There's a horse

18:50.004 --> 18:51.213
in my living room.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.383
He didn't hear

18:52.673 --> 18:54.383
it from me.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.386
What are you doing here?

18:57.428 --> 18:59.472
Hello, dad.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.309
Good impression, Steph.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.853
A little more

19:03.350 --> 19:05.853
Johnny Cash, though.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.563
Dad, I can't tell a lie.

19:07.605 --> 19:10.399
This is my horse.

19:07.605 --> 19:10.399
I've had him for two weeks.

19:10.441 --> 19:13.945
You can't tell a lie?

19:13.987 --> 19:16.697
There's a horse

19:13.987 --> 19:16.697
in my living room.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.241
There has to be a lie

19:16.739 --> 19:19.241
involved here somewhere.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.952
I can explain everything.

19:20.994 --> 19:23.537
How did you get it here?

19:20.994 --> 19:23.537
What were you thinking about?

19:23.579 --> 19:25.748
Has it been here

19:23.579 --> 19:25.748
for two weeks?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.667
How come the father

19:25.790 --> 19:27.667
knows nothing?

19:28.709 --> 19:30.544
Dad, this is Rocket.

19:30.586 --> 19:35.925
D.J., we have to talk.

19:30.586 --> 19:35.925
Go to your room.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.385
Would you guys please

19:35.967 --> 19:38.385
get this thing outside?

19:39.804 --> 19:42.515
I can't believe this.

19:39.804 --> 19:42.515
I just vacuumed in here.

19:44.767 --> 19:48.228
Well, you know anything about

19:44.767 --> 19:48.228
getting a horse to move?

19:48.270 --> 19:50.940
Well, yeah, there's a coin slot

19:48.270 --> 19:50.940
you just drop a quarter into.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.653
Alright, I'll ride him out.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.030
- Okay.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.824
Stay. Stay.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.824
Alright, let's go, Buttercup.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.242
Right here.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.242
There you go.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.414
Hi-yo, Buttercup!

20:10.960 --> 20:12.753
You know how much

20:10.960 --> 20:12.753
I love horses.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.588
And I just thought if

20:12.795 --> 20:14.588
I could prove to you that

20:14.630 --> 20:16.757
I could take care of

20:14.630 --> 20:16.757
Rocket all by myself

20:16.799 --> 20:19.468
that you would

20:16.799 --> 20:19.468
let me keep him.

20:19.510 --> 20:22.221
Why didn't you just come

20:19.510 --> 20:22.221
to me in the first place?

20:22.262 --> 20:23.848
Well, I started to.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.851
But then I saw you were

20:23.890 --> 20:26.851
gonna say no, so I stopped.

20:26.893 --> 20:30.813
But then you went ahead

20:26.893 --> 20:30.813
and did what you wanted to.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.272
I'm sorry, dad.

20:33.649 --> 20:36.069
Well, I'm sorry too.

20:36.110 --> 20:39.321
Because now I've

20:36.110 --> 20:39.321
got a big problem.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.115
What?

20:41.157 --> 20:44.827
Well, you got a horse

20:41.157 --> 20:44.827
without my permission.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.704
You lied where you've

20:44.869 --> 20:46.704
been after school.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.123
And you involved

20:46.746 --> 20:49.123
your sister in this.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.751
For the past two weeks it's been

20:49.165 --> 20:51.751
nothing but lies, hasn't it?

20:54.921 --> 20:57.590
Yeah.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.259
So how will I ever know when

20:57.631 --> 21:00.259
you're telling me the truth?

21:01.802 --> 21:04.180
I don't know.

21:04.222 --> 21:06.140
I'm sorry, dad.

21:06.182 --> 21:09.435
All I could think about

21:06.182 --> 21:09.435
was getting the horse.

21:09.476 --> 21:12.980
I just want you

21:09.476 --> 21:12.980
to trust me again.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.190
What can I do?

21:16.609 --> 21:18.194
Well..

21:19.653 --> 21:22.990
I don't know, D.J.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.909
But I want you to know..

21:24.951 --> 21:27.828
...even if you do

21:24.951 --> 21:27.828
something I don't like

21:27.870 --> 21:30.664
I'm always gonna love you.

21:30.706 --> 21:32.291
We'll find a way

21:30.706 --> 21:32.291
to work this out.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.048
Here.

21:44.262 --> 21:47.347
You're still gonna

21:44.262 --> 21:47.347
punish me, aren't you?

21:47.389 --> 21:49.976
Oh, yeah.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.644
Big-time.

21:51.685 --> 21:54.521
Well,

21:51.685 --> 21:54.521
what about Rocket?

21:54.563 --> 21:57.150
What would you do

21:54.563 --> 21:57.150
if you were me?

21:57.191 --> 21:59.152
I'd definitely

21:57.191 --> 21:59.152
let me keep him.

22:01.612 --> 22:04.865
Well, I'm sorry, honey

22:04.907 --> 22:07.367
but you have to

22:04.907 --> 22:07.367
give up the horse.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.126
I'm sorry, Rocket.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.919
When I first wanted

22:15.168 --> 22:16.919
to get you

22:16.961 --> 22:19.839
I just thought it'd be

22:16.961 --> 22:19.839
fun to have a horse.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.050
Now that I know you

22:19.880 --> 22:23.050
and how sweet you are

22:23.092 --> 22:25.511
you're my friend.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.471
I'm gonna miss you so much.

22:28.931 --> 22:31.809
Would you like to

22:28.931 --> 22:31.809
meet Rocket's new owner?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.853
I don't think so.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.938
We've already met.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.773
Becky, you're

22:35.980 --> 22:37.773
getting Rocket?

22:37.815 --> 22:39.566
Well, your dad told me

22:37.815 --> 22:39.566
what was going on

22:39.608 --> 22:42.528
and growing up on a farm,

22:39.608 --> 22:42.528
I miss being around animals.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.614
Especially horses.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.614
So here I am.

22:45.656 --> 22:48.284
You're lucky.

22:45.656 --> 22:48.284
You're getting a great horse.

22:52.163 --> 22:55.291
And, Rocket,

22:52.163 --> 22:55.291
you're getting a nice owner.

22:55.333 --> 22:58.502
Well, D.J.,

22:55.333 --> 22:58.502
I was wondering.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.296
Maybe you'd like to

22:58.544 --> 23:00.296
help me take care of him.

23:00.338 --> 23:04.217
- Even ride him once in a while.

23:00.338 --> 23:04.217
- I'd love to.

23:04.258 --> 23:05.801
But I have to ask my dad.

23:08.304 --> 23:11.307
Could I help

23:08.304 --> 23:11.307
take care of Rocket..

23:11.349 --> 23:13.809
...after my

23:11.349 --> 23:13.809
punishment's over?

23:13.851 --> 23:15.769
I think we can work

23:13.851 --> 23:15.769
something out.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.980
Thank you.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.980
You're the best.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.482
You're right, I am.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.069
- Thank you, Rebecca.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.069
- You're welcome.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.821
Look, Michelle.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.821
A horsey.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.198
You wanna pet the horsey?

23:31.451 --> 23:32.619
What does a horsey say?
