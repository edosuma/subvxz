WEBVTT

01:09.286 --> 01:10.287
Okay.

01:32.701 --> 01:33.658
Please.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.402
Come on come on, let's
go let's go let's go!

01:39.099 --> 01:39.969
You're all right.

01:40.839 --> 01:41.492
You're all right.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.365
Open the door!

01:45.453 --> 01:47.324
Come on.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.891
Fuck, come on, man.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.895
- Oh my God.
- Drive, drive!

01:52.895 --> 01:54.549
Okay, okay.
Fuck!

01:54.549 --> 01:55.506
Come on, baby.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.117
- Come on, Mitch!
- Where are we going?

02:04.733 --> 02:07.779
Baby!
Baby slow down, slow down.

02:07.866 --> 02:08.911
What happened?

02:09.912 --> 02:11.348
Is he gonna be okay?

02:11.435 --> 02:12.654
Jimmy is he gonna be okay?

02:12.784 --> 02:14.656
Baby you've got
to slow down, okay?

02:14.786 --> 02:16.092
You've got to slow down.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.659
Everything is gonna be fine,
but you've got to calm down.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.530
We cannot get pulled
over by the cops.

02:20.575 --> 02:21.532
Okay,
where do I go?

02:21.619 --> 02:23.578
- What do I do?
- Baby, listen to me.

02:23.665 --> 02:26.363
Listen to me, just
breathe slowly.

02:26.711 --> 02:27.886
What do I do?

02:27.886 --> 02:29.018
What do I do here?

02:29.149 --> 02:30.367
Just drive for now, okay?

02:30.454 --> 02:31.803
Nice and easy, okay?

02:31.803 --> 02:33.370
Just stay on the main road.

02:33.457 --> 02:34.371
I knew it.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.372
I knew it.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.026
What are we gonna do if he dies?

02:37.157 --> 02:37.983
Why did you have to do this?

02:38.114 --> 02:39.681
I told you, Ash, I told you.

02:39.811 --> 02:40.943
You don't get to just walk away!

02:41.117 --> 02:42.945
This was the only option!

02:42.945 --> 02:43.989
All right?

02:45.948 --> 02:47.123
What happened?

02:47.254 --> 02:49.821
Fuck, it all happened
so fast, you know?

02:49.952 --> 02:51.432
Fuck.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.608
We have to get
him to a hospital.

02:53.782 --> 02:54.913
Jimmy, do you hear me?

02:54.913 --> 02:55.958
We have to get
him to a hospital.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.352
Jimmy?

02:59.483 --> 03:00.267
Jimmy!

03:03.618 --> 03:04.401
He's dead.

03:06.751 --> 03:10.581
Okay.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.061
Ashley, Ashley, Ashley, baby.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.410
Baby, listen to me.

03:13.410 --> 03:14.542
Listen to me.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.632
We gotta keep it together okay?

03:17.719 --> 03:20.200
I need you to be strong.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.940
Can you do that for me?

03:21.940 --> 03:23.028
Yeah.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.856
Okay.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.031
All right, drive.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.208
Drive to the boat
launch near the dump.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.774
Mitch's boat is tied up there.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.168
Okay.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.669
Are you okay?

03:55.539 --> 03:56.888
Hey, baby.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.455
Are you okay?
Come on.

03:58.542 --> 03:59.630
Come on.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.241
We need to hurry okay, sweetie?

04:02.677 --> 04:03.765
We don't have much time.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.377
I love you, baby.
You're gonna be okay.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.859
Yeah, I'm okay.

04:10.859 --> 04:11.773
I'm okay.

04:11.903 --> 04:13.078
Just head down
to the boat okay?

04:13.209 --> 04:14.689
I'll meet you there.

04:14.819 --> 04:15.603
Okay.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.483
It's me.

04:26.483 --> 04:27.919
Where have I been?

04:28.050 --> 04:29.834
Mitch is fucking dead.

04:29.921 --> 04:30.705
Did you hear me?

04:32.097 --> 04:34.491
I said Mitch is dead.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.363
Look, I did what you asked.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.625
Yes, I have it!

04:38.539 --> 04:40.541
I don't give a shit!

04:40.715 --> 04:42.107
When Donnie finds it
missing he probably

04:42.238 --> 04:43.500
already knows I'm a dead man!

04:43.761 --> 04:46.721
You need to protect my
wife and my daughter!

04:46.938 --> 04:48.113
Don't tell me to calm down!

04:48.113 --> 04:48.853
Do you know Donnie?

04:50.725 --> 04:52.117
Listen, one hour.

04:52.248 --> 04:53.293
Same place as always.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.252
I give you the drive.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.298
You protect my family.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.734
How the fuck do
you let this happen?

05:43.865 --> 05:44.692
Fuck!

05:49.740 --> 05:51.655
How the holy fucking Christ
can you let this happen?

05:51.655 --> 05:53.004
Huh?

05:53.004 --> 05:55.050
What's the fucking
point of two guys

05:55.180 --> 05:56.878
at the fucking door to my club,

05:57.008 --> 05:59.576
two men at the door
to my fucking office?

05:59.576 --> 06:00.838
How'd this happen?

06:00.969 --> 06:02.927
Tell me how the fuck
it happened, huh?

06:03.145 --> 06:04.146
You fucking morons.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.366
Fucking hell.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.846
I wanna fucking know
who stole from me

06:09.020 --> 06:10.674
and I want his fucking
head on a fucking platter

06:10.805 --> 06:13.373
so I can serve him up
to my fucking friends!

06:13.373 --> 06:14.243
It was Jimmy.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.201
I'm sorry, say that again.

06:16.332 --> 06:17.768
It was Jimmy and
some other guy.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.030
What the fuck would
Jimmy want with the drive?

06:19.204 --> 06:20.380
He doesn't even know what it is.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.381
I don't know, boss.

06:21.468 --> 06:22.991
Of course you don't know.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.472
Okay.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.212
All right, let's just
calm down, all right?

06:27.212 --> 06:29.171
Get everyone, I mean
fucking everyone.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.566
I want Jimmy at the foot
of my desk within the hour.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.135
Now!

06:59.419 --> 07:01.943
Find a safe
place to hide this.

07:02.030 --> 07:02.813
What is this?

07:03.510 --> 07:05.207
Do you trust me?

07:05.381 --> 07:06.817
Yes, I trust you.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.645
I trust you with my life.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.212
But this is crazy.

07:10.299 --> 07:11.431
I have a way out of here.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.868
To start fresh
with a clean slate.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.826
But I can't trust
anyone anymore.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.741
Donnie most likely
knows it was me by now,

07:17.828 --> 07:20.657
so you and Sarah aren't
safe in the city.

07:20.657 --> 07:22.442
You guys need to leave town now.

07:22.529 --> 07:23.834
Immediately.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.228
I will catch up once
I sort this all out.

07:26.315 --> 07:28.535
Leave town and go where?

07:28.535 --> 07:29.579
We don't have anywhere to go.

07:31.407 --> 07:32.669
There is one place.

07:36.412 --> 07:37.457
No.

07:37.544 --> 07:38.458
No way.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.937
No one will find you there.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.070
I haven't talked to him
in over a decade, okay?

07:42.157 --> 07:43.898
I don't even know if
he's there anymore.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.726
I mean he could be
dead for all I know.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.250
Ash, think about it.

07:48.337 --> 07:49.773
No one knows about your dad.

07:49.904 --> 07:50.992
And no one will think to look

07:51.122 --> 07:53.255
in the Cayman Islands
for you and Sarah.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.909
You said you trust me, right?

07:57.128 --> 07:59.348
You guys gotta get on the
next flight out of here.

08:00.915 --> 08:02.003
It's best for Sarah.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.179
Best for Sarah?

08:04.309 --> 08:05.397
Okay, that man shouldn't
be allowed within

08:05.528 --> 08:08.488
200 yards of our child,
much less any kid.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.793
You gotta go.

08:09.924 --> 08:11.055
I love you.

08:27.724 --> 08:28.638
Hey sweetheart.

08:29.552 --> 08:30.640
Mom, what's going on?

08:32.468 --> 08:35.515
Um well your dad and
I planned a big surprise

08:35.602 --> 08:37.691
for your birthday
next week and we're

08:37.821 --> 08:40.911
taking you to a beautiful
tropical island, okay?

08:41.042 --> 08:41.956
Surprise!

08:44.175 --> 08:45.133
Gotta hurry, okay?

08:45.263 --> 08:46.917
Come on, we gotta go.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.919
Okay, up up up.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.704
But what about my test
on Othello next week?

08:50.791 --> 08:51.748
I'm not done reading it.

08:51.748 --> 08:52.619
Okay.

08:52.749 --> 08:53.707
It's gonna come with us.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.970
Come on, we gotta hurry, baby.

08:56.057 --> 08:57.841
Go go go go.
Come on.

09:33.964 --> 09:34.878
Hey Jimmy.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.314
Donnie wants to see you.

10:26.016 --> 10:26.843
Okay.

10:29.454 --> 10:30.630
First time to Cayman?

10:31.674 --> 10:33.110
First time to anywhere.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.809
Oh, well you're
gonna love the island.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.419
Do you have family meeting you?

10:37.506 --> 10:38.812
My grandpa lives here.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.770
Is he going to pick you up?

10:40.944 --> 10:41.728
No.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.513
But I have his address.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.125
Okay sweetie, so after we
land you stay on the plane

10:48.299 --> 10:50.258
and I'll make sure you
get where you need to go.

10:50.432 --> 10:51.433
Thank you.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.557
You scared the shit out of me.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.214
Are you okay?

13:00.562 --> 13:01.563
Did I hurt you?

13:02.999 --> 13:04.392
Are you lost?

13:04.827 --> 13:05.959
Looking for your parents?

13:06.960 --> 13:08.962
What are you doing here?

13:08.962 --> 13:12.617
I'm looking for Jim Benton.

13:12.748 --> 13:15.098
Where'd you hear that name?

13:16.534 --> 13:17.622
Or Matt Robbins?

13:20.756 --> 13:21.975
Who sent you?

13:21.975 --> 13:23.237
Where are you from?

13:23.324 --> 13:24.804
Why are you asking
about Jim and Matt?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.240
What the fuck are
you doing here?

13:26.327 --> 13:27.763
He's my grandfather!

13:31.158 --> 13:31.941
What?

13:33.290 --> 13:34.596
My mom said he lived here.

13:36.641 --> 13:37.947
Do you know how I can find him?

13:41.559 --> 13:42.343
I'm Matt.

13:43.692 --> 13:44.649
Matt Benton?

13:44.780 --> 13:45.607
No, Benton's the
other guy's name.

13:45.694 --> 13:46.913
I'm Matt Robbins.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.436
But people on the island
just call me Matt.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.133
You're not from here?

13:50.264 --> 13:51.613
No sir, I'm from the city.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.442
What's your name?

13:54.572 --> 13:55.356
Sarah.

13:58.576 --> 13:59.577
What are you doing?

14:01.275 --> 14:02.493
What have you got there?

14:04.060 --> 14:05.192
Is this your daughter?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.195
Oh shit, oh shit.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.414
Wow.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.590
Yeah, that's Ashley.

14:13.722 --> 14:14.723
That's my daughter.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.425
She looks all grown
up now, you know?

14:23.297 --> 14:24.428
How old are you?

14:24.428 --> 14:25.821
12.

14:25.952 --> 14:28.432
Well technically I'm 11,
but I'll be 12 in six days.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.522
How old are you?

14:31.696 --> 14:34.656
I don't know, I stopped
counting when I turned 30.

14:34.743 --> 14:37.093
60, late-60s I guess.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.616
Maybe 70.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.055
Are you hungry?

14:42.055 --> 14:43.404
You look hungry.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.494
I might have some
baloney sandwiches.

14:47.451 --> 14:48.800
You like baloney?

15:22.704 --> 15:23.705
I checked her, boss.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.185
No hard drive.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.143
Just a receipt for two
tickets to the Cayman Islands.

15:27.143 --> 15:29.102
Looks like the kid
left about an hour ago.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.277
Next one's for tomorrow.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.498
Where's Jimmy?

15:34.585 --> 15:36.587
"Where's Jimmy?"

15:36.718 --> 15:37.806
Where's fucking Jimmy?

15:40.461 --> 15:42.115
Where's my fucking hard drive?

15:42.245 --> 15:43.072
Hmm?

15:45.161 --> 15:47.294
Where's my fucking hard drive?

15:50.471 --> 15:52.299
Here we go.
Bobo go get Jimmy.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.738
Bobo what the fuck?

15:58.218 --> 15:58.958
Sorry boss.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.699
You kidding me?

16:10.360 --> 16:11.927
Oh my God!

16:14.974 --> 16:16.584
Look at you two.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.455
What a fucking mess.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.718
Look, I'm gonna make
this real easy for you.

16:20.718 --> 16:21.589
All right?

16:22.720 --> 16:24.592
Where.
Is.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.768
My fucking hard drive?

16:26.855 --> 16:28.291
No no no no no no please!

16:28.422 --> 16:30.250
Please don't, please!

16:31.077 --> 16:32.078
Please.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.950
You know what I think?

16:36.821 --> 16:39.302
I think Mr. Romance
here gave you the drive.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.478
And you sent it
ahead to the Caymans.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.002
With your daughter.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.177
Am I right?

16:44.177 --> 16:46.135
Look at me.

16:48.050 --> 16:48.877
Huh?

16:51.097 --> 16:53.012
Does she know she
has the hard drive?

16:57.233 --> 16:58.669
Ah.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.323
All right, the girl's got it.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.673
Get on that flight with this
bitch, take Bobo with you,

17:02.847 --> 17:05.067
and do not come back without
my fucking hard drive.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.112
What the fuck, Donnie?

17:06.242 --> 17:07.461
It's a little girl.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.028
I can handle this.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.334
I don't need Bobo with me.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.119
I know you can
handle it, okay?

17:13.249 --> 17:14.685
I know this.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.209
Don't think because I'm
asking Bobo to go with you

17:16.339 --> 17:17.514
doesn't mean that I don't
trust you or have faith

17:17.688 --> 17:20.213
in your ability 'cause
I do, all right?

17:20.343 --> 17:23.433
The hard drive is important
not just to me, but to Hector.

17:23.564 --> 17:24.826
All right?

17:24.913 --> 17:26.306
Now take Bobo with you.

17:29.352 --> 17:30.484
Hey.

17:31.876 --> 17:34.705
My friends are gonna go back
with you to get my drive, okay?

17:34.836 --> 17:35.706
What about Jimmy?

17:35.837 --> 17:37.056
No no.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.274
No, he needs a doctor

17:38.274 --> 17:40.146
No, you don't
worry about Jimmy.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.670
All right?
Jimmy's gonna stay here with me.

17:42.757 --> 17:44.715
You need to worry about
getting my hard drive.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.369
Now if you cause any
kind of commotion,

17:46.500 --> 17:47.718
you draw attention
to the police,

17:47.805 --> 17:50.939
you do something stupid,
you do fucking anything

17:50.939 --> 17:53.855
to compromise my friends here,
I swear to fucking Christ

17:54.725 --> 17:57.380
Jimmy will suffer worse
than you can imagine.

17:57.902 --> 17:58.903
Am I fucking clear?

18:00.731 --> 18:01.863
Tell me we're clear.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.517
- We're clear.
- Thank you.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.040
Get this bitch the
fuck out of my face.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.487
Hey Bobo.

18:17.661 --> 18:19.098
Come here.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.360
You get that drive back,

18:20.577 --> 18:22.492
you kill that bitch
and her daughter.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.755
Take them out to the
ocean, drop them deep.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.409
- Understood.
- Hey Bobo.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.630
Don't make me come out there.

18:30.326 --> 18:31.414
You know I fucking
hate the heat.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.242
- Understood.
- All right.

18:39.857 --> 18:42.904
I'm all out of cold cuts.

18:42.991 --> 18:44.862
But I do have some crunchy shit.

18:48.779 --> 18:49.998
No ice huh?

18:50.085 --> 18:52.000
I'm sorry there
princess, no ice.

18:52.087 --> 18:54.524
The freezer's broke,
fridge only does enough

18:54.655 --> 18:57.310
to keep the meat from
turning blue, but enough

18:57.310 --> 19:00.443
about my current
electrical current issues.

19:00.574 --> 19:02.663
What, pray tell,
are you doing here?

19:03.968 --> 19:05.231
Pray tell?

19:05.231 --> 19:07.842
Yeah, what are you
doing here, now, today?

19:07.972 --> 19:10.801
I haven't seen my daughter
since her mom died

19:10.975 --> 19:12.151
and now her daughter shows up

19:12.151 --> 19:14.327
at my front doorstep
with not a word.

19:14.327 --> 19:16.459
It makes a man
curious, you know?

19:16.590 --> 19:17.939
What are you doing here?

19:18.026 --> 19:18.896
Pray tell.

19:20.028 --> 19:22.422
I think my parents are
in some kind of trouble.

19:22.596 --> 19:23.640
Oh Ashley's in trouble.

19:23.771 --> 19:25.425
Okay, well there's a shocker.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.383
What is it this time?

19:27.383 --> 19:28.297
She in jail?

19:30.691 --> 19:32.040
Okay, that was mean.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.998
That wasn't, goddammit,
I didn't mean that.

19:34.129 --> 19:35.348
I'm sorry.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.176
I'm sorry, just tell
me what happened.

19:40.875 --> 19:44.966
Up until last night,
mom told me you were dead.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.359
It's easy to see why.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.621
Sorry I bothered you.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.840
No no no, Sarah,
Sarah, I'm sorry.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.973
Sorry, I was a shitty dad.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.714
I won't argue that.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.499
But right now I really need you

19:56.630 --> 19:59.633
to tell me what
happened to your mom.

19:59.763 --> 20:00.764
Please?

20:03.027 --> 20:04.899
Yesterday I
came home early from school

20:05.029 --> 20:07.293
and I could hear my mom and
dad arguing about something.

20:07.423 --> 20:08.598
Mom, dad, I'm home!

20:08.598 --> 20:10.078
Dad was
saying something about

20:10.165 --> 20:11.949
"no other way out" and
he needed mom's help.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.604
Later that night mom woke me
up in the middle of the night.

20:14.604 --> 20:17.477
She packed my bag and went
straight to the airport.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.698
Mom tried to get a
ticket for her as well,

20:21.829 --> 20:23.613
but they only had one seat left.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.311
So she put me on the
plane and she handed me

20:25.441 --> 20:27.051
some money and gave
me this address

20:27.182 --> 20:28.792
and said I'd find you here.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.099
I know something's wrong.

20:32.013 --> 20:33.232
Hmm...

20:33.232 --> 20:35.321
Where's your mom now?

20:35.321 --> 20:37.366
Well she said she
would be here tomorrow.

20:40.195 --> 20:42.241
Why do you have two names?

20:43.851 --> 20:46.593
I'm gonna find out when the
flights are landing tomorrow.

20:48.072 --> 20:51.032
Oh, you want some
more soda water?

20:51.206 --> 20:52.251
No thanks.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.481
All right, all right.

21:07.657 --> 21:08.789
I got this.

21:15.404 --> 21:16.971
I was wondering
when you were gonna call

21:17.101 --> 21:18.973
and tell me what
happened tonight.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.583
How do you know what happened?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.368
Oh Donnie, please.

21:22.498 --> 21:23.760
I know everything.

21:23.891 --> 21:25.588
I've always told you
never underestimate

21:25.719 --> 21:27.764
the power of information.

21:27.764 --> 21:29.897
And the fact that you
don't know that I know

21:30.027 --> 21:32.378
already puts you in a weakened
position and we haven't

21:32.465 --> 21:35.163
even started talking
about the problem at hand.

21:36.164 --> 21:38.427
Which is my missing hard drive?

21:39.733 --> 21:41.300
You know, I had it before.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.779
I'll get it again.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.826
You have 24 hours before I
step in and solve this myself.

21:45.956 --> 21:47.480
Hey, I can deal with it.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.785
I hope so.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.134
Because if you can't
it begs the question

21:50.265 --> 21:51.875
what use are you at all?

22:04.845 --> 22:06.150
Fuck!

22:06.281 --> 22:07.108
Fuck!

22:07.195 --> 22:08.065
Fuck!

22:09.110 --> 22:09.937
Fuck!

22:24.299 --> 22:25.126
All done?

22:25.213 --> 22:26.301
Yes, thank you.

22:26.301 --> 22:27.737
Mom never lets me eat in bed.

22:27.911 --> 22:28.738
Really?

22:28.912 --> 22:30.349
That's weird.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.698
She used to love it.

22:33.569 --> 22:34.744
You're a football fan?

22:34.744 --> 22:36.267
I love football.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.747
I want to be a quarterback
when I grow up.

22:37.921 --> 22:38.879
Good.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.448
Are there a lot of
girl quarterbacks?

22:43.013 --> 22:45.364
Girls can do
anything guys can do.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.583
I'm the fastest
player on my team.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.368
Okay, well let's talk football

22:49.368 --> 22:51.370
tomorrow when your
mom gets here.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.110
Why do you have two names?

22:56.766 --> 22:59.160
I'll tell you
sometime over a beer.

22:59.160 --> 22:59.987
Goodnight.

23:34.456 --> 23:35.805
Hi, you've
reached Ashley.

23:35.805 --> 23:36.980
I can't get to my
phone right now.

23:36.980 --> 23:37.981
Leave a message.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.044
Purpose for your visit?

23:57.218 --> 23:58.698
Business or pleasure?

23:58.828 --> 23:59.742
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.637
Is this the place?

24:26.508 --> 24:27.857
Hey.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.337
Is this the place?

24:29.337 --> 24:31.295
I don't know, I've
never been here.

24:34.298 --> 24:36.779
Listen, I am in no
mood for bullshit.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.173
So you better fucking tell
me where that disc is.

24:39.303 --> 24:40.783
Or I'm gonna tear
your fucking arms off.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.481
- You understand me?
- Mmmhm.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.351
Hard drive.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.094
What?

24:47.311 --> 24:48.530
You said disc.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.271
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

24:50.358 --> 24:51.968
Hey, I don't know, you know?

24:52.099 --> 24:53.709
Maybe she thinks you meant disc.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.232
That's not what Donnie needs.

24:55.363 --> 24:57.757
You think I don't know
what fucking Donnie needs?

24:57.887 --> 25:00.281
Shut the fuck up, get in
there, and check it out.

25:00.281 --> 25:01.500
Yes sir, boss.

25:03.545 --> 25:04.633
Jesus fucking Christ.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.296
Well she was here.

25:17.037 --> 25:18.299
But there's no hard drive.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.784
I want that
fucking hard drive.

25:31.704 --> 25:32.835
Are you rich?

25:32.966 --> 25:35.272
Well that depends
upon your perspective.

25:35.403 --> 25:37.840
If you can't afford this
breakfast then I'm rich

25:37.971 --> 25:40.060
because I can afford
to pay for it.

25:43.063 --> 25:43.890
Ah.

25:46.762 --> 25:48.242
So how'd you end up here?

25:48.372 --> 25:50.200
Well I don't like cold weather

25:50.374 --> 25:51.854
and I don't like too much rain,

25:51.985 --> 25:55.989
but I do like to fish, so
seemed like a good place.

25:56.119 --> 25:56.946
You retired?

25:57.120 --> 25:58.469
Yeah.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.688
How long you been retired?

26:01.777 --> 26:03.562
About 20 years I guess.

26:03.562 --> 26:04.867
Why'd you retire?

26:04.998 --> 26:07.740
It wasn't my choice,
I was told to retire.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.176
By who?

26:09.306 --> 26:10.394
You writing a book?

26:10.525 --> 26:11.831
Who'd you work for?

26:11.961 --> 26:13.833
I worked for Uncle Sam.

26:13.963 --> 26:15.051
The government.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.662
Yep, I worked for
the government.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.968
Did you know Uncle Sam is
actually based on a real person?

26:19.142 --> 26:20.056
No.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.667
His name was Sam Wilson.

26:21.667 --> 26:24.017
He was a meat packer
during the War of 1812.

26:24.104 --> 26:26.106
The troops got to calling
the meat Uncle Sam's meat.

26:26.236 --> 26:27.716
And from that point
on it was used

26:27.847 --> 26:29.588
as a unifying cry
to the Americans.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.763
Impressive.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.678
Remind me to avoid
trivia games with you.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.245
So what did you do
for the government?

26:35.463 --> 26:36.638
I was an arbitrator.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.989
I'm guessing you know the
origin story of arbitration too.

26:40.294 --> 26:41.861
No, I don't know what that is.

26:41.991 --> 26:43.079
Is it like a lawyer?

26:43.210 --> 26:46.474
Yes, but in my case
I was more of a...

26:47.780 --> 26:48.824
Negotiator.

26:48.911 --> 26:51.653
So if two sides couldn't
come to an agreement

26:51.653 --> 26:55.483
they'd send me in to
sort out the argument.

26:57.050 --> 26:58.399
Were you good at your job?

26:59.226 --> 27:00.444
I got the job done.

27:00.575 --> 27:01.794
Then why'd you retire?

27:01.794 --> 27:03.883
Told you,
it wasn't my choice.

27:04.840 --> 27:05.798
Can I ask you a question?

27:05.798 --> 27:07.060
Oh now you're asking?

27:07.147 --> 27:08.801
You already asked me
a hundred questions.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.280
You won't get mad?

27:10.454 --> 27:13.893
Sarah, you
always knock me for a loop.

27:14.023 --> 27:15.721
What's the question?

27:15.938 --> 27:17.636
Why did mom tell
me you were dead?

27:18.462 --> 27:20.508
I always wanted a grandfather.

27:20.508 --> 27:23.946
I had a grandmother,
but it's different.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.121
She probably
wouldn't let you order

27:25.252 --> 27:27.123
a double stack with
extra chocolate chips.

27:27.297 --> 27:28.734
Here, have some more
syrup, sweetheart.

27:28.734 --> 27:31.432
- There you go.
- Or asked if I wanted a beer.

27:31.519 --> 27:32.912
Yeah.

27:39.266 --> 27:40.702
Now listen, kid.

27:40.963 --> 27:43.139
If you mother
wanted you to think

27:43.270 --> 27:45.185
that I'm dead, it's
for your own good.

27:45.489 --> 27:47.100
You see, when she
was a little girl

27:47.970 --> 27:50.059
I was home all of two
months out of the year.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.235
And when I was home I was...

27:54.107 --> 27:55.761
No fun.

27:55.848 --> 27:58.546
And then when June,
your other grandmother,

27:58.633 --> 28:03.769
got sick I just up and left
to some godforsaken country.

28:03.769 --> 28:07.207
I left your mother all alone
to take care of her mother.

28:07.729 --> 28:11.690
So if she wants to
visualise me as "dead"

28:11.777 --> 28:14.040
then she has every right.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.349
All right, well let's go.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.481
We should go.

28:28.445 --> 28:30.970
I forgive you, grandpa.

28:43.939 --> 28:46.159
Jesus Christ it's fucking hot.

28:51.077 --> 28:52.818
Hey.

28:52.948 --> 28:53.732
Take it easy.

29:00.956 --> 29:02.523
You ever see someone
try to walk around

29:02.610 --> 29:03.611
without one of these?

29:05.482 --> 29:06.614
It's really fucked up.

29:09.399 --> 29:10.879
You see, this little tendon here

29:11.967 --> 29:13.229
has a lot to do
with your ability

29:13.360 --> 29:14.753
to walk around
and stand upright.

29:16.624 --> 29:21.760
So if you don't tell
me where that disc...

29:26.155 --> 29:30.377
If you don't tell where
that hard drive is,

29:30.638 --> 29:34.294
I'm going to snip
that fucking tendon.

29:34.468 --> 29:37.645
And watch you hop around
like a fucking invalid.

29:38.951 --> 29:40.648
Until you shit me
out a hard drive.

30:01.103 --> 30:02.583
Hey kid.

30:02.670 --> 30:03.627
Why don't you slouch down.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.804
Just lay low for a few minutes.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.196
Why?

30:07.196 --> 30:09.155
Well you said your parents
were in trouble right?

30:10.286 --> 30:11.505
Yeah, I guess.

30:11.679 --> 30:13.681
Well then would you
mind slouching down?

30:14.987 --> 30:16.162
Yeah, yeah, okay.

30:16.336 --> 30:17.685
Good.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.992
Stay down until I
tell you it's okay.

30:19.992 --> 30:20.949
I'll be right back.

30:25.780 --> 30:26.607
Whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa.

30:26.694 --> 30:28.000
Take it easy, slow down.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.610
Who the fuck is that?

30:29.610 --> 30:31.438
That's my father.

30:31.438 --> 30:32.482
I think.

30:32.569 --> 30:33.701
He doesn't know
anything about this.

30:33.788 --> 30:35.007
Where
the fuck is your kid?

30:35.007 --> 30:35.964
I don't know, I swear.

30:38.358 --> 30:39.446
Dad.

30:39.707 --> 30:40.621
Where's Sarah?

30:40.708 --> 30:42.014
Don't worry.

30:42.101 --> 30:43.319
Fellas!

30:43.450 --> 30:45.278
Welcome to the island!

30:45.278 --> 30:46.583
You friends of Ashley?

30:46.583 --> 30:47.497
Ow!

30:47.628 --> 30:48.847
Dad what's wrong?

30:48.847 --> 30:49.848
It's just my back.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.110
I just gotta sit down.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.415
Sorry guys, just...

30:54.287 --> 30:56.593
I've been dealing with
this crap for six years.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.597
Okay, that's better.

31:02.034 --> 31:05.298
I'll tell you, once you
hit 60 the warranty's off.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.300
You know what I mean?

31:07.387 --> 31:10.303
You guys gotta invest in
some better beachwear.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.522
Aren't you dying
in those jackets?

31:13.959 --> 31:17.571
Listen, we don't mean
to be rude, but we believe

31:17.701 --> 31:20.966
you have something we're
looking for and ideally

31:21.053 --> 31:24.186
I'd like to grab it and be on
the next flight out of here.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.536
I don't have anything!

31:26.754 --> 31:29.670
Ashley what's the Dapper
Danny talking about?

31:31.063 --> 31:33.195
I am really trying to be nice.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.544
Trying to be nice?

31:34.631 --> 31:36.677
But I'm losing my
fucking patience.

31:36.677 --> 31:37.896
No no no, come on!

31:48.167 --> 31:50.909
This guy's fucking crazy.

32:24.377 --> 32:25.508
Dad!

32:31.297 --> 32:32.254
Dad.

32:33.516 --> 32:35.736
Did you shoot me?

32:35.954 --> 32:37.042
I am so sorry.

32:37.172 --> 32:38.391
- Are you okay?
- Wow!

32:38.391 --> 32:40.393
Did you shoot just me or
did you shoot him too?

32:40.523 --> 32:42.047
No, just you.

32:42.177 --> 32:43.831
Did he get away?

32:44.005 --> 32:45.876
- Yes, and he took your truck.
- Fuck!

32:46.007 --> 32:47.182
You know what?
It is just a truck.

32:47.269 --> 32:48.618
This is pretty much you.

32:48.705 --> 32:50.142
You just go straight to
yelling at me for screwing up

32:50.142 --> 32:51.317
Sarah's in the truck!

32:52.492 --> 32:53.362
Fuck!

33:11.728 --> 33:13.774
My drive better be
in your fucking hands.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.603
Bobo.

33:16.733 --> 33:17.647
Bobo!

33:17.778 --> 33:19.258
Bad news, boss.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.128
General's dead.

33:23.523 --> 33:26.308
Ashley, she brought us to
her dad's house, right?

33:26.308 --> 33:28.702
There's nobody there, so I
went inside, I look around.

33:28.832 --> 33:30.269
The little girl had been there

33:30.269 --> 33:31.487
but no hard drive,
so we wait around.

33:31.618 --> 33:33.011
Eventually dad comes back.

33:33.098 --> 33:34.534
- Whose dad?
- Whose dad?

33:34.664 --> 33:35.622
I just said Ashley.

33:35.622 --> 33:36.971
Ashley's dad, old guy.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.320
Very very old guy.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.496
Anyway, that's when
everything goes south right?

33:40.670 --> 33:42.672
General pulls a gun
and the old man,

33:42.846 --> 33:44.631
I don't know, he killed him.

33:44.761 --> 33:45.893
He killed him?

33:45.980 --> 33:47.025
I thought you just
said General had a gun.

33:47.112 --> 33:48.896
Yeah, well that's
the thing, boss.

33:48.983 --> 33:52.378
The guy used a, what's
the word, a hand weight.

33:52.813 --> 33:54.119
What?

33:54.206 --> 33:55.511
Yeah, you know,
like a dumbbell?

33:55.642 --> 33:58.427
General looks away, old
man hits him over the head.

33:58.601 --> 33:59.733
Boom, kills him.

33:59.863 --> 34:01.691
I just got out of
there with my life.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.345
Ashley's shooting at
me and everything.

34:03.476 --> 34:05.434
Who the fuck kills
someone with weights?

34:05.565 --> 34:06.914
I know, boss.

34:07.001 --> 34:09.482
Personally I've never
seen anything like it.

34:09.656 --> 34:11.832
Sorry for your loss, Donnie.

34:11.919 --> 34:12.920
So to recap.

34:14.922 --> 34:17.011
You didn't get my drive.

34:17.011 --> 34:19.100
My little half brother's dead.

34:19.100 --> 34:22.625
Beaten to death with
a fucking dumbbell.

34:25.106 --> 34:27.065
Anything else you've
forgotten, Bobo?

34:27.239 --> 34:29.328
Well yeah, there's
one other thing.

34:30.894 --> 34:32.592
I got Ashley's kid.

34:34.463 --> 34:35.899
Hold that fucking kid.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.251
Get somewhere low key.

34:39.251 --> 34:42.428
I don't care, just sit tight.

34:52.525 --> 34:55.963
Looks like we gotta
lay low for awhile.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.358
You're not gonna give
me any trouble are you?

35:00.098 --> 35:00.924
Good.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.842
You understand this is
nothing personal right?

35:06.016 --> 35:10.543
This is just what you call
an unfortunate circumstance.

35:10.717 --> 35:13.633
I don't feel one way or the
other about any of this.

35:13.807 --> 35:14.286
Understand?

35:15.635 --> 35:17.071
Good.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.160
So if you give me any
trouble, you don't listen

35:19.247 --> 35:20.596
to what I tell you, I'm gonna
shoot you in the head twice,

35:20.770 --> 35:21.902
I'm gonna dump you in the ocean,

35:21.989 --> 35:23.121
and I'm gonna go get a pizza.

35:23.121 --> 35:24.426
We clear?

35:35.176 --> 35:39.615
Well we're gonna have to
call the cops about this.

35:39.789 --> 35:41.400
No, dad, they have Sarah.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.576
They will kill her.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.012
I guarantee you there's
more men that are already

35:45.099 --> 35:47.536
coming for me and that
hard drive and now you

35:47.667 --> 35:49.669
and they will not stop
until we are all dead.

35:51.279 --> 35:54.152
But right now all I care about
is getting my daughter back.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.024
Where's the drive now?

36:02.377 --> 36:03.944
And you don't know
what's on here?

36:04.031 --> 36:05.685
No, I have no idea.

36:05.815 --> 36:07.904
I don't even think Jimmy
knows what's on that.

36:08.035 --> 36:09.645
All I know is that
Jimmy kept telling me

36:09.819 --> 36:10.994
that that drive was our way out.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.735
Out of what?

36:12.822 --> 36:14.041
Everything.

36:14.128 --> 36:16.348
Jimmy was working
full time for Donnie.

36:16.565 --> 36:17.958
As his driver.

36:18.045 --> 36:20.090
And once a guy like Donnie gets

36:20.221 --> 36:22.310
his claws in you it's
hard to get away.

36:23.616 --> 36:24.704
Like ever.

36:27.707 --> 36:30.536
Pretty risky to try and kill
two people in broad daylight.

36:32.146 --> 36:35.367
I'm guessing the Jerry Lewis
Telethon isn't on here.

36:35.367 --> 36:36.672
All right.

36:36.803 --> 36:38.065
Let's get rid of the body.

36:38.935 --> 36:40.198
How do we do that?

36:42.635 --> 36:43.853
I am so sorry that I shot you.

36:44.027 --> 36:44.854
- Are you sure you're okay?
- It's fine.

36:44.985 --> 36:46.508
It's just a graze.

36:46.595 --> 36:49.032
When we get back we should
find a place to lay low.

36:49.424 --> 36:51.078
An out of the way hotel.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.080
- Grab an end.
- Oh no, I can't, I

36:53.167 --> 36:54.603
Do I have to do
everything myself?

36:54.603 --> 36:55.517
Okay, you know what?

36:55.648 --> 36:56.605
Fine, I will grab his feet.

36:56.736 --> 36:57.780
Fine.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.044
Okay?
On three.

37:01.871 --> 37:02.916
Two.
One.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.526
- Hup!
- Wait wait wait wait wait!

37:04.526 --> 37:05.484
What?

37:05.614 --> 37:06.963
Well what if
someone finds him?

37:07.094 --> 37:10.880
Ashley, this is
the Cayman Trench.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.447
It's a five mile drop down.

37:12.969 --> 37:13.796
There's nobody there.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.450
Okay.
Okay.

37:15.581 --> 37:17.060
And.

37:17.278 --> 37:18.453
Hup!

37:19.976 --> 37:21.369
Down she goes.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.726
So that's all for now.

37:30.900 --> 37:34.774
I expect your reports
tomorrow morning by 8 AM.

37:49.441 --> 37:51.138
So how did it go?

37:51.269 --> 37:52.052
It's a burn.

37:53.358 --> 37:55.360
Whole thing's a burn.

37:55.534 --> 37:58.058
We're talking eight
months of legwork here.

37:58.058 --> 37:59.668
Where's your man inside?

37:59.799 --> 38:00.887
Compromised.

38:02.497 --> 38:03.890
With drive.

38:04.020 --> 38:05.195
So your man

38:05.326 --> 38:07.981
is probably hanging in a
meat locker somewhere

38:08.111 --> 38:10.200
and the drive is back in
the hands of the bad guys.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.072
Is that about the
sum of your report?

38:12.072 --> 38:13.595
Like I said.

38:13.726 --> 38:14.814
It's a burn.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.946
Do I need to tell you
what's on that drive?

38:17.077 --> 38:17.904
No ma'am.

38:18.034 --> 38:19.688
Are you sure?

38:19.862 --> 38:20.863
Quite sure.

38:51.198 --> 38:52.112
Drisdale.

38:52.547 --> 38:53.592
It's me.

38:55.376 --> 38:56.203
Hello?

38:57.770 --> 39:01.904
Do you know your current
file reads "Gone Elvis"?

39:02.122 --> 39:03.079
That's funny.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.995
I remember you telling me to,

39:06.518 --> 39:09.042
how'd you put it,
do some fishing?

39:09.172 --> 39:10.391
Early retirement?

39:10.565 --> 39:12.219
Oh you know that that
order came from above me.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.786
Yeah yeah.

39:13.786 --> 39:16.658
Hand me a sack of shit and
tell me it's fish and chips.

39:16.789 --> 39:18.051
You know as well as I do

39:18.181 --> 39:19.835
that you frustrated
every superior,

39:20.009 --> 39:23.230
and subordinate for that
matter, that you ever had.

39:23.491 --> 39:26.233
You assaulted a two
star general, Matthew.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.756
Do you know what that
guy had going on the side?

39:27.756 --> 39:29.671
I've heard this
all before remember?

39:29.802 --> 39:33.371
And I am very busy, so
if you'll excuse me.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.328
I need.

39:35.808 --> 39:36.896
Your help.

39:38.854 --> 39:42.684
As I recall, asking for help
was not your strong point.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.817
Fair enough.
It's my daughter Ashley.

39:44.904 --> 39:46.166
She's in deep with
some bad people

39:46.166 --> 39:47.689
and I need some information.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.039
Well how serious is
the trouble she's in?

39:50.126 --> 39:51.171
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

39:51.258 --> 39:52.781
I've got two names, Donnie Iger

39:52.781 --> 39:55.175
and some guy who calls
himself The General.

39:55.349 --> 39:56.611
How do I reach you?

39:56.698 --> 39:58.091
I'll reach back out to you.

39:58.265 --> 40:01.399
All right, well let me try
to get you some information.

40:25.248 --> 40:26.728
"But I will wear my heart upon

40:26.859 --> 40:29.296
"my sleeve for daws to peck at."

40:30.471 --> 40:32.430
"I am not what I am."

40:32.430 --> 40:33.648
Excuse me?

40:33.779 --> 40:35.433
Iago.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.217
Othello's most trusted officer?

40:37.217 --> 40:38.914
- You know Othello?
- Sure.

40:39.088 --> 40:40.916
Why are you so surprised?
It's a famous play.

40:41.090 --> 40:42.309
It's almost like
you're looking at me

40:42.396 --> 40:44.006
like I'm a guy who would
never read Shakespeare.

40:44.180 --> 40:45.312
Jesus.

40:45.399 --> 40:46.531
I thought your
generation doesn't

40:46.661 --> 40:48.141
judge people by
their appearances.

40:48.315 --> 40:49.098
No, I didn't mean

40:49.185 --> 40:50.056
Take it easy, take it easy.

40:50.186 --> 40:51.449
I'm just kidding you.

40:55.061 --> 40:56.628
Did you have to
read it for school?

40:58.456 --> 41:00.327
Lady, I never
went to no school.

41:00.414 --> 41:03.635
How did you learn to read
if you never went to school?

41:03.896 --> 41:05.071
You ever hear of Oliver Twist?

41:05.463 --> 41:06.725
I think so.

41:06.725 --> 41:07.769
Is he the one who
asks for more soup?

41:07.943 --> 41:09.249
"Please, sir.

41:09.336 --> 41:11.556
"Can I have some more?"

41:11.643 --> 41:13.296
- Is that supposed to be Oliver?
- Are you kidding me?

41:13.427 --> 41:15.429
That was a great Oliver.

41:15.429 --> 41:16.778
Anyway, I was an orphan.

41:16.909 --> 41:19.302
And some guy, he picked me up.

41:19.433 --> 41:20.652
Took me into his house.

41:20.652 --> 41:22.567
He fed me and he taught
me over the years.

41:22.567 --> 41:25.395
Taught me how to read,
taught me how to write.

41:25.526 --> 41:27.963
Taught me how to gather
my thoughts coherently.

41:28.137 --> 41:30.096
Convey them concisely.

41:30.226 --> 41:31.358
Taught me how to shave.

41:33.578 --> 41:35.101
He was a great man.

41:35.231 --> 41:36.798
What happened?

41:36.798 --> 41:39.671
Well you're gonna have to
read Oliver Twist aren't you?

41:39.671 --> 41:41.063
Because his story and mine?

41:41.934 --> 41:43.283
One and the same.

41:43.370 --> 41:44.502
That's not possible.

41:44.589 --> 41:45.590
What are you talking about?

41:45.720 --> 41:47.505
"Never trust a coincidence."

41:47.592 --> 41:49.463
My science teacher once said.

41:49.463 --> 41:50.682
Ooh.

41:50.682 --> 41:52.901
Your science teacher huh?

41:52.901 --> 41:55.338
Maybe he thinks I'm
more like Iago huh?

41:55.469 --> 41:57.036
I'm not what I seem to be?

41:57.166 --> 41:59.517
Yeah, you seem shifty.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.301
- What page you on?
- 78.

42:01.388 --> 42:03.216
It's hard to understand.

42:03.346 --> 42:04.304
Yeah, I get that.

42:04.391 --> 42:05.697
All right look.

42:05.697 --> 42:07.699
You keep reading, I
gotta make a call.

42:07.699 --> 42:09.831
I'm gonna ask you a
few questions later.

42:09.962 --> 42:11.267
Pay attention.

42:14.575 --> 42:15.794
Purpose of your visit?

42:15.924 --> 42:17.099
Business or pleasure?

42:17.186 --> 42:18.100
Pleasure.

42:32.071 --> 42:33.507
Where's phone?

42:33.507 --> 42:34.813
Over there, sir.

42:42.385 --> 42:43.561
Bobo's room.

42:44.649 --> 42:45.693
No, just Bobo.

42:48.304 --> 42:50.872
- Yeah.
- Bobo it's us.

42:51.003 --> 42:52.178
What room you in?

42:52.352 --> 42:53.440
528, come on up.

42:54.789 --> 42:56.095
Gonna see your mom soon.

43:01.143 --> 43:02.231
Dad.

43:02.405 --> 43:04.451
I'm sorry Ash, I'm
just trying to...

43:04.538 --> 43:06.061
They're gonna hurt
Sarah aren't they?

43:06.192 --> 43:07.367
No no no, don't
think like that.

43:07.367 --> 43:08.890
You don't know these people.

43:08.977 --> 43:10.849
Killing her is nothing to them.

43:10.849 --> 43:14.592
They won't kill her as
long as we have the drive.

43:14.809 --> 43:16.332
But here's what I
don't understand.

43:16.463 --> 43:18.857
How can Sarah be
anywhere near this?

43:18.857 --> 43:20.902
How can you have a life with
her anywhere near these

43:21.033 --> 43:22.991
You don't know
anything about my life.

43:23.383 --> 43:24.689
Or Sarah's.

43:25.341 --> 43:27.692
Jimmy was just a
driver, nothing more.

43:27.692 --> 43:30.608
He didn't hurt people,
he didn't sell drugs.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.000
We were just trying
to get a leg up.

43:32.087 --> 43:33.872
Is that how he ended
up with the hard drive?

43:34.002 --> 43:36.091
He overheard
Donnie talking about

43:36.222 --> 43:38.267
how he was gonna get
a leg up on Hector

43:38.354 --> 43:40.226
and the drive was
gonna make that happen.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.183
Wow.

43:41.401 --> 43:42.445
Wow, okay.

43:52.151 --> 43:53.761
Okay.

43:56.285 --> 43:59.114
Ashley, you are
never responsible.

43:59.288 --> 44:01.290
And now you're a parent and
you're even less responsible.

44:01.464 --> 44:04.816
Oh wow, because you
were some great example

44:04.816 --> 44:06.078
of what a parent should be?

44:06.165 --> 44:07.079
Should I follow your example?

44:07.166 --> 44:08.689
I get it, I get it.

44:08.689 --> 44:11.910
You leave for months on
end with no contact or call

44:11.910 --> 44:14.869
because you pretty much missed
every birthday I ever had.

44:14.869 --> 44:16.349
You made your point.

44:16.479 --> 44:17.916
Even when you were in town,
so don't fucking tell me

44:17.916 --> 44:20.483
how to be a parent because
you have no fucking idea!

44:30.580 --> 44:32.757
-  Where are you going?
- I am going to get some ice.

44:32.757 --> 44:34.541
Ashley those guys could
already be looking for you.

44:34.541 --> 44:36.848
I think I can
get some ice, dad!

44:37.022 --> 44:38.023
Okay.

44:50.035 --> 44:51.036
What?

44:51.210 --> 44:52.037
It's them.

44:52.124 --> 44:53.473
Who?

44:53.691 --> 44:54.692
The bad guys.

44:54.779 --> 44:57.999
- Get away from the door.

44:58.260 --> 45:00.001
Come on, Ashley.

45:00.132 --> 45:02.177
We've got your girl.

45:02.177 --> 45:03.439
I need you
to do something for me

45:03.570 --> 45:05.572
and there's probably no way
you're gonna want to do it.

45:05.659 --> 45:06.921
I need you to open
the door really fast,

45:06.921 --> 45:08.140
then I'm gonna grab one of them,

45:08.227 --> 45:09.358
pull them in here,
and then you're gonna

45:09.445 --> 45:11.404
slam the door shut
once he's in here okay?

45:11.578 --> 45:12.884
Have you completely
lost your mind?

45:12.884 --> 45:14.363
I gotta separate these guys.

45:14.537 --> 45:15.713
I can deal with them one at
a time, but not all at once.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.018
Deal with them?

45:17.149 --> 45:20.021
- You can do this.
- I'm gonna count you in, ready?

45:20.152 --> 45:22.502
He's gonna get it
eventually anyway!

45:22.589 --> 45:24.156
You know this is true!

45:24.243 --> 45:26.680
On three, two, one.

45:26.680 --> 45:28.551
- Go!
- Ashley, don't make me

45:43.175 --> 45:44.742
Is this one of the bad guys?

45:47.048 --> 45:48.746
Yeah, that's one
of Donnie's soldiers.

45:53.533 --> 45:54.752
What's going on?

45:56.144 --> 45:57.363
It's gonna be hard to explain.

45:57.493 --> 45:58.320
Where's Leon?

45:59.539 --> 46:00.453
He took him.

46:00.583 --> 46:02.411
- Who took him?
- Some guy.

46:02.585 --> 46:03.543
He grabbed him, pulled
him into the room.

46:03.630 --> 46:05.763
Are you fucking kidding me?

46:05.763 --> 46:08.069
Get in there and
fucking get him!

46:18.863 --> 46:19.777
I don't remember.

46:19.864 --> 46:21.082
Were you afraid of heights?

46:21.213 --> 46:22.780
Not really.
Why?

46:23.824 --> 46:25.130
I'm gonna lower you down.

46:26.174 --> 46:27.262
You've gotta be kidding me.

46:27.393 --> 46:28.568
No no, no time
to talk about it.

46:28.568 --> 46:29.438
Just gotta go.

46:29.569 --> 46:31.092
Now Ashley, gotta go now.

46:31.223 --> 46:33.268
All right now, come on.

46:33.399 --> 46:35.270
Here we go.
Come on.

46:35.401 --> 46:37.185
There you go.
Off you go.

46:37.185 --> 46:38.099
Up and over.

46:38.230 --> 46:39.666
Now Ashley, gotta go right now.

46:42.538 --> 46:43.888
Come on.

46:44.018 --> 46:46.107
That's it.
That's my girl.

46:47.065 --> 46:48.153
You got it.

46:50.590 --> 46:51.678
I can't let go.

46:51.678 --> 46:52.940
- I've got you, let go.
- I can't let go.

46:53.549 --> 46:55.813
Don't make me push you.

47:04.430 --> 47:05.431
Come here!

47:09.565 --> 47:10.392
Fuck!

47:57.570 --> 48:00.051
If these guys are willing
to risk killing us in public,

48:00.355 --> 48:02.488
we're gonna need a better
defensive position.

48:02.618 --> 48:04.751
A defensive position?

48:04.838 --> 48:06.971
And how are you
doing these things?

48:07.101 --> 48:08.189
Who are you?

48:08.320 --> 48:10.757
Ash, I can appreciate
this is a bit weird,

48:10.757 --> 48:12.672
and I can explain a
bit more about my past,

48:12.759 --> 48:13.891
but right now we need to leave.

48:15.501 --> 48:16.589
Oh look at him, we're gonna
give him a heart attack.

48:16.719 --> 48:18.765
Okay, so all of those
times that you were

48:18.765 --> 48:20.549
leaving us for six
months at a time

48:20.636 --> 48:22.682
you were, what, killing people?

48:22.682 --> 48:23.988
No, God!

48:24.118 --> 48:25.163
I mean no.

48:26.555 --> 48:28.079
You were killing people?

48:28.340 --> 48:29.776
I mean besides the ones
that I've seen you kill?

48:29.776 --> 48:30.995
Hey, I killed
those guys trying

48:30.995 --> 48:33.780
to save your ass, so
give a guy a break.

48:33.780 --> 48:36.391
- Wait, so-
- Can this guy move any slower?

48:36.391 --> 48:37.523
What, you're some kind
of assassin or something?

48:38.654 --> 48:39.612
Can you open the door?

48:39.742 --> 48:41.483
I gotta get off the balcony!

48:46.227 --> 48:48.012
What the fuck?

48:48.142 --> 48:49.361
Thank you.

48:49.535 --> 48:50.797
You're a gentleman
and a scholar.

48:50.884 --> 48:52.451
- Thank you so much.
- Is it hot?

48:58.152 --> 48:59.675
Jesus Christ.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.512
Whoa whoa, taxi!

49:13.689 --> 49:14.821
That's Ashley.

49:16.997 --> 49:18.390
Who is this guy?

49:25.136 --> 49:27.573
Yes, hello, can you connect me

49:27.660 --> 49:29.401
to the Cayman Cab
Company please?

49:29.792 --> 49:31.098
Appreciate that, thank you.

49:31.751 --> 49:33.057
Yes, hello.

49:33.057 --> 49:35.842
Look, my father and my
sister just got into

49:35.929 --> 49:37.975
one of your cabs in
front of Seashell Hotel.

49:37.975 --> 49:39.846
And here's the
thing, my father left

49:39.933 --> 49:41.630
all of his heart
medication in the room.

49:41.804 --> 49:44.416
Is it possible for you to
tell me where they're headed?

49:44.807 --> 49:46.418
Well see, that's the weird part.

49:46.635 --> 49:49.899
The phone is with the heart
medication here in the room.

49:50.117 --> 49:50.988
Anyway, I'd really appreciate it

49:50.988 --> 49:52.990
if you could help me out here.

49:53.251 --> 49:55.079
Oh no no no, never again.

49:55.949 --> 49:57.429
They're heading to the
Marina in Capo Bay.

49:57.516 --> 49:58.604
The Capo Bay Marina.

49:58.821 --> 50:01.172
Thank you so much, goodbye.

50:01.172 --> 50:02.260
Asshole.

50:03.043 --> 50:05.176
Hey, that's pretty smart.

50:10.659 --> 50:11.704
The only thing I
want to hear you say

50:11.878 --> 50:13.532
is that you got my drive
and everyone's dead.

50:13.662 --> 50:15.229
Say it.
Say it.

50:15.664 --> 50:17.536
Not exactly, boss.

50:17.666 --> 50:18.798
You're not gonna be happy.

50:18.798 --> 50:20.278
Fuck!

50:20.278 --> 50:21.192
Why is no one answering
their phones, huh?

50:21.192 --> 50:22.541
What the fuck's
going on down there?

50:22.671 --> 50:24.195
Where's Gibson?
Where's Ronik?

50:24.195 --> 50:25.196
Put Ronik on.

50:25.196 --> 50:26.327
See that's the thing, boss.

50:26.458 --> 50:29.026
The old guy, he keeps
killing everybody.

50:29.243 --> 50:30.244
The dad.

50:30.244 --> 50:31.202
Everybody!

50:51.483 --> 50:53.528
I send three of my
best guys down there

50:53.702 --> 50:56.140
to fucking grab a hard
drive from a little girl

50:56.270 --> 50:57.750
and her fucking mom
and you're telling me

50:57.880 --> 51:01.058
the grandfather just killed
three more of my men?

51:01.058 --> 51:02.711
Yeah, pretty much, yeah.

51:02.885 --> 51:04.278
"Pretty much" "pretty much."

51:04.409 --> 51:05.671
Fuck.

51:05.758 --> 51:07.151
Bobo, listen really
carefully all right?

51:07.238 --> 51:09.370
I gotta call Hector, tell her
what the fuck is going on,

51:09.501 --> 51:10.980
so I'm thinking in
the meantime maybe,

51:11.111 --> 51:14.158
I don't know, find out who
the fucking grandpa is?

51:14.288 --> 51:16.160
Can you give me a fucking name?

51:16.247 --> 51:20.077
That's funny boss because
actually, hang on a second.

51:20.251 --> 51:22.253
I got um...

51:22.253 --> 51:23.471
I got two names here.

51:23.602 --> 51:25.082
Okay.

51:25.082 --> 51:27.475
I got a Matt Robbins.

51:27.475 --> 51:29.086
And I got a Jim Benton.

51:29.086 --> 51:30.565
Great, which
one's the grandpa?

51:30.739 --> 51:32.393
Well that's the thing
boss, we're not really sure,

51:32.524 --> 51:35.222
but it's definitely
one of the two.

51:36.484 --> 51:37.659
Fuck!

51:41.663 --> 51:42.577
Sit tight, okay?

51:42.708 --> 51:45.058
Until I fucking get down there.

51:46.973 --> 51:48.366
You guys got passports?

52:13.913 --> 52:14.914
You hungry?

52:16.350 --> 52:19.092
All right.
What's your favourite food?

52:19.092 --> 52:20.441
Pizza.

52:20.572 --> 52:21.877
All right, me too.

52:25.881 --> 52:26.882
I'll make you a deal.

52:29.798 --> 52:30.886
You good on your word?

52:31.887 --> 52:33.237
Yeah.

52:33.237 --> 52:34.325
All right, now I get
that I'm the bad guy

52:34.325 --> 52:35.630
in this particular circumstance,

52:35.761 --> 52:38.067
but your work should
be solid no matter

52:38.198 --> 52:40.548
what side of the fence
you're on, am I right?

52:40.809 --> 52:42.507
Yeah, that makes sense.

52:42.594 --> 52:43.812
All right.

52:43.986 --> 52:45.336
So now we're gonna go,
we're gonna get pizza,

52:45.336 --> 52:46.641
and we're gonna see your mom.

52:46.772 --> 52:47.642
But when we get downstairs

52:47.773 --> 52:49.688
there's gonna
be cops everywhere.

52:49.818 --> 52:51.951
And you gotta be good, okay?

52:52.908 --> 52:55.346
Because if I get
busted, Donnie is gonna

52:55.346 --> 52:57.304
kill your mom sure
as I'm sitting here.

52:58.392 --> 52:59.611
Understand?

52:59.959 --> 53:01.787
Okay, I understand.

53:01.787 --> 53:02.744
All right.

53:02.918 --> 53:03.702
Let's go.

53:05.312 --> 53:08.576
Remember, we get caught
your mom dies, yeah?

53:08.576 --> 53:09.969
I understand.

53:10.056 --> 53:10.926
Let's go.

53:16.932 --> 53:17.716
What?

53:19.413 --> 53:21.198
Why did you want
to be the bad guy?

53:24.157 --> 53:25.985
You know, I never
really thought about it.

53:27.334 --> 53:29.380
I've just been the bad
guy from the beginning.

53:30.468 --> 53:33.210
Just circumstances I guess.

53:35.690 --> 53:36.517
How about you?

53:36.648 --> 53:37.692
You the good guy?

53:37.823 --> 53:39.564
I mean, you know, girl?

53:42.349 --> 53:46.832
I think so, but it's
not over yet is it?

53:48.877 --> 53:50.401
That's what I'm saying.

53:50.401 --> 53:51.576
Circumstances.

53:52.620 --> 53:53.969
You ready, madam?

54:22.128 --> 54:22.911
Hang on.

55:07.086 --> 55:08.566
Captain!

55:08.696 --> 55:09.697
Captain Joseph!

55:10.394 --> 55:11.743
Permission to come aboard!

55:14.354 --> 55:17.096
If you're here for that
$25 you can turn around.

55:17.096 --> 55:18.315
I didn't cheat.

55:18.315 --> 55:19.577
Joey.

55:19.707 --> 55:21.883
Joey, you remember
my daughter Ashley?

55:22.057 --> 55:22.841
Ashley?

55:24.059 --> 55:25.539
- Your Ashley?
- Yeh.

55:26.279 --> 55:28.063
My, little Ashley.

55:28.194 --> 55:30.327
Well you're not so
little anymore huh?

55:33.417 --> 55:36.202
My Lord how time flies.

55:36.289 --> 55:39.510
The last time I saw you you
were about eight years old.

55:39.510 --> 55:40.598
Of course you
wouldn't remember me.

55:40.728 --> 55:42.774
You were just a wee thing.

55:43.775 --> 55:45.777
What are you guys doing here?

55:45.864 --> 55:48.780
Well in short, I'm a
worse parent than he is.

55:48.867 --> 55:51.043
Ashley and her husband
seem to have gotten

55:51.173 --> 55:52.653
mixed up with some bad people.

55:52.784 --> 55:54.655
Ooh.
How bad?

55:54.786 --> 55:56.309
They tried to kill us.

55:56.309 --> 55:57.310
Twice.

55:57.310 --> 55:58.529
Hmm

55:58.529 --> 56:01.270
Little Ash always
getting in trouble.

56:01.401 --> 56:03.272
Okay, can we focus please?

56:03.403 --> 56:06.101
Well whoever the players are
they all seem to want this.

56:06.232 --> 56:08.974
Hey, can I use your computer
and see what's on this thing?

56:09.104 --> 56:09.975
Yeah.

56:10.105 --> 56:10.932
Come on.

56:12.978 --> 56:15.633
Joey here was a
mine sweeper back when

56:15.633 --> 56:17.112
we were stationed
overseas together.

56:18.331 --> 56:20.159
For those diplomatic
missions we were on.

56:21.334 --> 56:23.380
What is a mine sweeper
doing on diplomatic missions?

56:23.380 --> 56:25.469
Yeah, there.
Click on that.

56:25.599 --> 56:27.645
Yeah, open that file please.

56:29.168 --> 56:30.822
Whoa.

56:31.213 --> 56:32.563
Is this what I think it is?

56:32.563 --> 56:34.042
What does this have
to do with Jimmy?

56:34.216 --> 56:36.784
If this is for real I'm
ready to call the agency.

56:36.784 --> 56:38.569
This is bigger than
anything I've ever seen.

56:38.569 --> 56:40.701
This some James Bond shit.

56:40.919 --> 56:41.833
How'd you get this?

56:41.833 --> 56:43.225
James Bond?

56:43.356 --> 56:44.705
You know what?

56:44.836 --> 56:46.577
You're gonna need
to get off my boat.

56:50.015 --> 56:51.016
Drisdale.

56:51.016 --> 56:53.279
These guys continue
to be a problem.

56:53.366 --> 56:55.194
Three of them just
tried to kill me.

56:55.281 --> 56:56.848
Are they dead?

56:56.935 --> 56:58.719
Did you find out anything
on those two names?

56:58.850 --> 56:59.720
Yes I did.

56:59.851 --> 57:01.896
These are very bad people.

57:02.027 --> 57:02.897
How bad?

57:03.028 --> 57:06.118
Well Donnie Iger is
the guy who it seems

57:06.248 --> 57:08.425
your little girl
stole the drive from.

57:08.512 --> 57:09.687
She didn't steal anything.

57:09.817 --> 57:11.689
This drive landed in
her lap from her husband

57:11.689 --> 57:13.908
who didn't look both ways
before he crossed the street.

57:14.039 --> 57:15.432
Well he looked both ways

57:15.432 --> 57:16.911
when he decided to
work with Donnie.

57:17.042 --> 57:19.653
I mean he is a
lifelong piece of shit.

57:19.653 --> 57:21.699
He did seven years hard time,

57:21.829 --> 57:24.528
but when he came out
he spent the next

57:24.658 --> 57:27.705
10 years working his
way up the membership.

57:28.445 --> 57:29.924
Organised crime.

57:30.098 --> 57:32.144
Yep, and Matt,
let me tell you.

57:32.318 --> 57:34.929
These guys are into everything.

57:35.060 --> 57:40.108
Drugs, human trafficking,
money laundering, firearms,

57:40.805 --> 57:45.984
cyber crimes, and Donnie runs
a small arm of the membership.

57:46.506 --> 57:51.468
His boss is one Hector Garcia.

57:57.082 --> 58:00.564
♪ Well I walk that walk

58:00.694 --> 58:04.350
♪ And talk that talk ♪

58:04.524 --> 58:07.658
♪ Said you're so fine ♪

58:07.658 --> 58:10.965
♪ Said you'll be mine

58:11.139 --> 58:12.750
♪ And we'll talk that talk ♪

58:12.750 --> 58:14.621
I apologise if I
kept you waiting.

58:18.233 --> 58:19.583
Have you not eaten?

58:19.713 --> 58:21.367
Oh please, eat something.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.979
No, no I'm fine.

58:25.110 --> 58:26.807
Thank you, Mrs. Garcia.

58:26.894 --> 58:31.508
Oh please, oh my
goodness, call me Hector.

58:37.514 --> 58:40.125
You work for me, yes?

58:40.255 --> 58:41.430
Yes.

58:41.561 --> 58:42.867
And forgive me, you are...

58:42.954 --> 58:44.172
Helen.

58:44.390 --> 58:46.305
No no, not your name,
what you do for me.

58:46.392 --> 58:47.741
You are...

58:47.828 --> 58:48.873
I'm sorry.

58:50.744 --> 58:51.789
I'm an...

58:52.616 --> 58:53.878
I'm an accountant.

58:55.967 --> 58:57.316
Yes.

58:57.403 --> 58:58.273
That's it.

59:00.928 --> 59:02.495
Helen, come with me.

59:12.592 --> 59:15.682
Helen, do you know of a
company called AJ Boat Carters?

59:17.075 --> 59:19.338
AJ Boat Carters is not
actually a boat company,

59:19.425 --> 59:21.340
it's just a front to move cash.

59:21.427 --> 59:22.776
Do you know this?

59:23.734 --> 59:27.520
Do you know about the $16,246.87

59:27.520 --> 59:29.783
that has moved
into that company?

59:29.870 --> 59:30.784
I'm sorry.

59:32.307 --> 59:34.222
Mrs. Garcia, please.

59:34.396 --> 59:35.833
I'm so sorry, I was stupid.

59:35.963 --> 59:36.703
Come with me.

59:37.922 --> 59:38.749
Oh God.

59:49.020 --> 59:50.151
Beer?

59:50.238 --> 59:51.326
No thank you.

59:53.981 --> 59:56.767
You know, this would be.

59:56.767 --> 59:59.465
The part
in the movie where

59:59.552 --> 01:00:03.121
I tell you not to be
so hard on your dad.

01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:06.603
'Cause he's got some
good qualities too.

01:00:07.778 --> 01:00:09.997
Yeah, the ol' pal comes to
his buddy's rescue routine.

01:00:10.432 --> 01:00:11.912
Classic.

01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:15.046
Not really, but I
know he was hurting

01:00:15.307 --> 01:00:16.917
being apart from your guys.

01:00:18.223 --> 01:00:20.355
So what, my dad's
like Rambo or something?

01:00:22.053 --> 01:00:23.924
Not quite Rambo, but your dad

01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:27.624
used to have a very
special talent.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:31.323
He was what we called a sneak.

01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:33.020
Whenever there was
someone we couldn't get to

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:37.155
for one reason or another
they'd send in your dad.

01:00:37.285 --> 01:00:39.418
My dad's an assassin isn't he?

01:00:42.943 --> 01:00:45.424
Never came from me, but yeah.

01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:47.252
Your dad's totally an assassin.

01:00:47.382 --> 01:00:48.645
Are you shitting me?

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.124
No, no, not really.

01:00:50.298 --> 01:00:54.433
He had this unique ability
to get in unnoticed,

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.696
get the job done, and get out.

01:00:57.958 --> 01:01:01.701
When he killed those
guys and watched them die,

01:01:02.093 --> 01:01:04.704
and don't get me wrong,
they were bad guys,

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:08.186
but it was like it
didn't even affect him.

01:01:08.316 --> 01:01:11.537
It was like he was just
taking the trash to the curb.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:17.108
When I was a boy my
father had a heart attack.

01:01:17.195 --> 01:01:19.676
And later that night
he was recovering

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:20.851
in the emergency ward.

01:01:20.851 --> 01:01:23.157
I was sitting right by his side

01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:26.378
when they two doctors rushed in.

01:01:26.508 --> 01:01:28.423
Because the guy in
the bed next to my dad

01:01:28.554 --> 01:01:30.556
was going into cardiac arrest.

01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:33.864
Now they came in, but
they couldn't save him.

01:01:33.864 --> 01:01:36.257
And he died right
there in front of us.

01:01:37.215 --> 01:01:41.523
Now I certainly never
seen a man die before.

01:01:41.523 --> 01:01:44.222
We just stood there.

01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:46.572
Stunned.

01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:50.097
Then, and I will
never forget this.

01:01:50.097 --> 01:01:52.709
I heard one doctor
ask the other doctor

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:56.538
if he knew who won
the Dodgers game.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:57.496
Baseball?

01:01:58.584 --> 01:02:00.368
How can they be talking
baseball when a man

01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:02.327
had just died right
in front of them?

01:02:03.371 --> 01:02:04.895
That's when I knew.

01:02:05.025 --> 01:02:08.986
The more death you've seen,
the less it affects you.

01:02:08.986 --> 01:02:11.423
And I think your
dad has seen so much

01:02:11.553 --> 01:02:15.383
that any effect it may
have had is long gone.

01:02:16.558 --> 01:02:18.169
Please.

01:02:34.011 --> 01:02:34.881
Oh God.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.057
Please.

01:02:37.188 --> 01:02:38.755
Please please don't do this.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.626
Pull yourself together.

01:02:41.627 --> 01:02:42.497
Look again.

01:02:48.286 --> 01:02:49.983
Are you going to be loyal?

01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:51.158
Yes.

01:02:51.158 --> 01:02:52.769
Do you love your daughters?

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:54.422
Yes.

01:02:54.553 --> 01:02:55.510
Of course you do.

01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:59.210
Then they should be
fine without a father.

01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:04.128
No!

01:03:05.303 --> 01:03:07.087
Shh, shh-shh-shh-shh.

01:03:08.523 --> 01:03:11.265
If you steal from me again,
you and your daughters

01:03:11.396 --> 01:03:13.572
will be on that boat and
they will go in first.

01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:15.313
Do you understand?

01:03:18.098 --> 01:03:19.143
Yes.

01:03:21.406 --> 01:03:24.670
Please feel free to take
some fruit home to your girls.

01:03:24.757 --> 01:03:26.454
I'll have someone
prepare a basket.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:29.240
It's no bother.

01:03:29.327 --> 01:03:31.808
This woman is not to
be messed with, Matt.

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:34.332
She has very powerful friends.

01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:40.686
Tell John to push
our lunch next week.

01:03:40.773 --> 01:03:42.688
And I want specifics
on the mayor meeting.

01:03:42.775 --> 01:03:44.342
I don't want another
incident with that woman.

01:03:44.472 --> 01:03:45.256
I'm on it.

01:03:50.652 --> 01:03:51.566
Everyone out.

01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:55.919
What should I
tell the Sheffields?

01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:57.616
Tell them I'll throw in
use of the private jet.

01:03:57.703 --> 01:03:59.096
But that's it.

01:03:59.226 --> 01:04:01.489
I need their support publicly.

01:04:01.794 --> 01:04:02.839
Now go.

01:04:02.839 --> 01:04:04.492
And close the door
on your way out.

01:04:04.579 --> 01:04:06.103
Make sure I'm not disturbed.

01:04:13.023 --> 01:04:14.024
I thought we had
an understanding

01:04:14.024 --> 01:04:15.503
you would not contact me here.

01:04:15.677 --> 01:04:17.375
The drive
has been stolen.

01:04:19.812 --> 01:04:21.509
I'm gonna have to
ask you to repeat that.

01:04:21.727 --> 01:04:23.294
The drive
has been stolen.

01:04:23.424 --> 01:04:24.861
How?

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.514
I have
it under control.

01:04:26.601 --> 01:04:27.951
Yeah, I think you and I have

01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:29.822
two different definitions
of "under control".

01:04:29.822 --> 01:04:31.650
I'll get the drive.

01:04:31.737 --> 01:04:32.607
How?

01:04:34.392 --> 01:04:36.350
What about your
man on the inside?

01:04:36.524 --> 01:04:38.396
I think we can both
agree on one thing.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.051
It is in our mutual interest
to recover the drive

01:04:41.051 --> 01:04:44.445
and I can assure you I
have my best men on it.

01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:46.012
Well that's a relief.

01:04:47.318 --> 01:04:49.537
Does anyone know
what's on that drive?

01:04:49.624 --> 01:04:50.625
No.

01:04:50.843 --> 01:04:51.888
Where are your men now?

01:05:03.856 --> 01:05:06.250
You heading down for
the Blackbeard festival?

01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:10.863
- Yarrgh!
-  Yarrgh!

01:05:12.517 --> 01:05:13.518
Enjoy your flight.

01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:20.917
I think we got a problem.

01:05:21.134 --> 01:05:23.310
I'm calling you for a solution.

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.359
Purpose of your visit?

01:05:28.576 --> 01:05:30.187
Business or pleasure?

01:05:30.317 --> 01:05:31.492
Business.

01:05:47.378 --> 01:05:48.422
So you remember
when you first rolled

01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:50.120
you wanted a seven
but you didn't get it?

01:05:50.207 --> 01:05:51.382
- Yeah.
- All right,

01:05:51.382 --> 01:05:55.038
so now if you
roll a seven it's game over.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:57.214
For everybody, whether
they bet on you or not.

01:05:57.301 --> 01:05:59.433
So everybody's cheering
you on to not roll a seven.

01:05:59.433 --> 01:06:03.960
You roll any other number,
everybody who bets on you wins.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.178
And you keep rolling.

01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:06.266
Okay.

01:06:06.397 --> 01:06:07.441
Who are you gonna bet on?

01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:08.790
Well I'm thinking
you're a shooter,

01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:10.705
so I'm betting on you, kid.

01:06:14.187 --> 01:06:15.623
Ooh!

01:06:15.754 --> 01:06:16.624
You're a natural.

01:06:16.755 --> 01:06:17.712
Roll again.

01:06:21.847 --> 01:06:23.892
My God, she's en fuego.

01:06:24.023 --> 01:06:25.764
We're going to Vegas
when this is over.

01:06:25.851 --> 01:06:27.287
All right, numb nuts.

01:06:40.213 --> 01:06:41.345
I didn't get a gun.

01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:47.003
The fuck am I gonna
do with this thing?

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:49.092
Stick it up your ass.

01:06:49.222 --> 01:06:50.441
Hey.

01:06:50.615 --> 01:06:52.486
What's going on with
our pal Othello?

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.488
Why does Othello
trust Iago so much

01:06:54.619 --> 01:06:56.490
when it's pretty
obvious to everyone

01:06:56.621 --> 01:06:59.145
around him that Iago is lying?

01:07:00.668 --> 01:07:02.322
How does he not see it?

01:07:02.453 --> 01:07:03.541
I don't know.

01:07:03.671 --> 01:07:04.846
It's always the
ones closest to you

01:07:04.977 --> 01:07:07.240
get you in the end, you know?

01:07:07.414 --> 01:07:08.459
Go ahead, roll.

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.420
Ah, you bust.

01:07:16.467 --> 01:07:17.816
Be right back.

01:07:18.991 --> 01:07:20.079
Hey boss.

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.255
Yeah, she's with me.

01:07:22.342 --> 01:07:25.128
All right, I'll send
you the address.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.436
All right, we got this fuck.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:30.394
Head east.

01:07:32.874 --> 01:07:35.007
East, don't make me
fucking say it again.

01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:36.226
I don't know which way's east.

01:07:36.226 --> 01:07:37.401
Left, do you know
which way's left?

01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:38.358
Yeah.

01:07:54.592 --> 01:07:56.594
I'm at work.

01:07:56.594 --> 01:07:58.683
Maybe it's time you got
your priorities straight.

01:07:58.813 --> 01:08:00.076
You made a promise to me

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:02.034
that you have yet
to materialise on.

01:08:02.252 --> 01:08:04.080
Take the drive from
that neanderthal

01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:06.604
Donnie and shut him down.

01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:09.085
Every time we send our men
some old guy kills them.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.783
This isn't just some old guy.

01:08:11.913 --> 01:08:14.742
He's ex-Special Ops, he
used to work for my boss.

01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:16.179
You're not gonna believe this,

01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:19.138
but he's the father-in-law
of my snitch.

01:08:19.138 --> 01:08:21.184
I'm lost, the old
guy that's killing my men?

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:24.883
Yes, he's a major badass
you want to avoid at all cost.

01:08:36.547 --> 01:08:38.418
All right, where's
this motherfucker?

01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:41.378
That blue one over there.

01:08:41.378 --> 01:08:44.511
Ashley, the old man, and I
don't know, some other guy.

01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:45.991
All right.

01:08:46.078 --> 01:08:46.905
Here, get rid of her.

01:08:50.474 --> 01:08:52.084
Boss.

01:08:52.954 --> 01:08:54.130
Maybe we keep her
around, you know?

01:08:54.217 --> 01:08:55.783
Just in case
circumstances change?

01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:58.873
Why the fuck does everybody
make me say things twice?

01:09:00.353 --> 01:09:03.226
Just get rid of her, all right?

01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:13.801
Save me the suspense.

01:09:13.932 --> 01:09:14.889
What are we dealing with?

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.456
All right.

01:09:16.587 --> 01:09:17.588
You know Rambo?

01:09:17.675 --> 01:09:18.632
So he's Rambo.

01:09:18.763 --> 01:09:20.025
No, I'm pretty sure this guy

01:09:20.025 --> 01:09:22.245
taught Rambo
everything he knows.

01:09:22.245 --> 01:09:25.030
He won the Silver Star
for bravery twice.

01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:26.858
That hasn't been done
since World War II.

01:09:26.988 --> 01:09:27.946
Well Donnie and
his men are about

01:09:28.033 --> 01:09:29.339
to permanently retire him.

01:09:29.339 --> 01:09:31.776
Listen to me very carefully.

01:09:31.776 --> 01:09:33.952
This is not a man to
be messed with, okay?

01:09:34.039 --> 01:09:35.519
He's a killing machine.

01:09:37.042 --> 01:09:39.131
If he's got the drive
you're gonna need leverage.

01:09:39.131 --> 01:09:40.350
Use the daughter.

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.960
Do not engage.

01:09:42.047 --> 01:09:44.267
That might be too late.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.358
Fuck.

01:09:53.232 --> 01:09:56.453
For fuck's sake,
get back, get back.

01:09:56.583 --> 01:09:58.846
Motherfucker.

01:09:58.977 --> 01:10:00.457
All right, listen.

01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:02.459
First thing is don't fucking
kill anybody all right?

01:10:02.589 --> 01:10:04.200
I need them all alive.

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.289
Especially that fucking old man.

01:10:06.419 --> 01:10:08.465
The most important thing is that

01:10:08.595 --> 01:10:10.380
motherfucking hard
drive, all right?

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.382
I can't stress that enough.

01:10:12.382 --> 01:10:14.993
We get that drive back,
we'll kill them all.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:15.994
All right?

01:10:15.994 --> 01:10:17.300
We're gonna surround them.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:20.216
We're gonna trap them.
It's that easy.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.565
Yeah, that's a good plan.

01:10:24.437 --> 01:10:26.091
All right, you three.

01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:28.528
Sneak to the far side,
come in from that side.

01:10:28.659 --> 01:10:30.095
You three, go around.

01:10:30.095 --> 01:10:32.837
Sneak in from the
other side, all right?

01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:35.492
Guys, they got
nowhere fucking to go.

01:10:35.622 --> 01:10:37.581
We got them.
Go go go go go.

01:10:42.281 --> 01:10:43.587
Get back, get back.

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:49.680
They found us.

01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:50.942
You got any weapons on board?

01:10:51.072 --> 01:10:53.074
Oh my God.
How did they find us?

01:10:53.074 --> 01:10:54.250
Weapons like guns?

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.512
That'd be good.

01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:04.695
Would this even kill someone?

01:11:04.782 --> 01:11:07.350
I doubt it.
Might set them on fire.

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:08.742
I'll tell you what though,
if you shoot somebody

01:11:08.873 --> 01:11:10.918
up close with that thing
it'll severely slow them down.

01:11:11.702 --> 01:11:13.356
You need to hide
her somewhere.

01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:15.227
I got the place.

01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:21.059
I'm not going down there.

01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:22.539
Ashley.

01:11:26.369 --> 01:11:27.892
Don't come out until
I come back for you.

01:11:40.687 --> 01:11:43.124
Are you gonna kill my
mommy and grand daddy?

01:11:43.342 --> 01:11:45.126
Nah, I just want to talk.

01:11:47.128 --> 01:11:49.566
You know, my daddy
always says if someone's

01:11:49.696 --> 01:11:50.784
not looking you in
the eye when they

01:11:50.958 --> 01:11:52.308
give you answers it
means they're lying.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.527
I just want to talk all right?

01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:55.833
Come on, let's go.

01:12:01.099 --> 01:12:02.187
Yo Ashley!

01:12:04.363 --> 01:12:05.190
You in there?

01:12:06.539 --> 01:12:07.975
Hey grandpa, you in there?

01:12:08.106 --> 01:12:09.629
Grandpa?

01:12:09.716 --> 01:12:11.283
I believe you have something
that was stolen from me!

01:12:11.675 --> 01:12:14.591
I understand you have
something that belongs to me!

01:12:14.591 --> 01:12:16.636
Yeah, I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about!

01:12:16.767 --> 01:12:18.203
My granddaughter!

01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:21.728
Soon as I know she's safe
I'll give you what you need.

01:12:22.773 --> 01:12:24.514
This look familiar?

01:12:24.514 --> 01:12:26.472
Gotta get that fucking drive.

01:12:28.082 --> 01:12:29.649
Hey yo!

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.347
Listen, let's just
calm down, all right?

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.349
We can work this out!

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:34.654
Tell you what!

01:12:34.785 --> 01:12:36.221
I'm gonna send one
of my guys back

01:12:36.308 --> 01:12:38.179
to get your
granddaughter, all right?

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:39.355
Okay!

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.704
I can wait here.

01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:06.730
Stay low.

01:13:37.195 --> 01:13:38.762
Dad!

01:13:44.898 --> 01:13:46.247
All right, stop here.

01:13:49.642 --> 01:13:51.296
Turn around.

01:13:53.254 --> 01:13:54.560
I said turn around.

01:13:58.825 --> 01:14:01.219
- All right.
- Where is your code?

01:14:01.306 --> 01:14:02.525
What?

01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:03.874
Good guy or bad guy
you gave me your word.

01:14:04.265 --> 01:14:05.658
And you promised.

01:14:08.052 --> 01:14:10.707
I thought you had a code
of honour or something.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:20.978
Jesus Christ.

01:14:24.068 --> 01:14:25.330
Dad!

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:27.071
Please please please!

01:14:32.424 --> 01:14:33.686
All right.

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:34.557
Let's go.

01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:39.823
Hey!

01:14:45.219 --> 01:14:46.264
Get back here!

01:14:47.091 --> 01:14:48.266
Hey!

01:14:48.353 --> 01:14:49.223
Goddammit!

01:14:50.007 --> 01:14:51.835
Stay back,
stay back, stay back.

01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:56.492
Don't move.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.281
- Got you now mother-
- Grandpa!

01:15:45.932 --> 01:15:47.064
Please!

01:15:47.194 --> 01:15:48.413
Help me!

01:15:48.413 --> 01:15:50.284
Dad!

01:16:14.613 --> 01:16:15.440
Dad!

01:16:16.789 --> 01:16:17.573
Mom?

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:19.357
Mom!

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:20.880
Sarah!

01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:23.535
Save me!
Sarah I'm down here!

01:16:23.535 --> 01:16:25.537
Mom?

01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:27.234
Sarah open the hatch quick!

01:16:27.365 --> 01:16:28.192
Baby!

01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:42.206
Sarah please!

01:16:42.336 --> 01:16:43.773
Open the hatch!

01:16:43.773 --> 01:16:45.035
Baby!

01:16:45.122 --> 01:16:46.906
He's coming!

01:16:54.697 --> 01:16:58.135
You're almost there, just
keep trying for me okay?

01:17:15.195 --> 01:17:16.588
Almost got it!

01:17:18.068 --> 01:17:20.070
Come on baby, you can do it!

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.602
Mom he's here!

01:17:31.864 --> 01:17:32.865
Mom!

01:17:40.525 --> 01:17:42.222
Stay the fuck away
from my daughter!

01:17:51.971 --> 01:17:54.757
Iago.

01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:27.920
- Get in the boat.
- Fuck you.

01:18:28.007 --> 01:18:29.879
Get in the fucking
boat or you die.

01:18:36.537 --> 01:18:38.235
Get in the fucking boat!

01:18:40.150 --> 01:18:41.368
Get in the boat.

01:18:46.678 --> 01:18:47.897
Go!

01:18:50.595 --> 01:18:51.727
Fucking get in the boat!

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.163
Please, no, please
please please

01:18:53.337 --> 01:18:54.033
Get in the boat
or I'll kill her!

01:18:54.164 --> 01:18:55.731
Please please please!

01:19:26.326 --> 01:19:27.414
I've been shot.

01:19:28.111 --> 01:19:29.068
Twice.

01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:30.548
Let me get you to my truck.

01:19:42.386 --> 01:19:43.691
Drisdale.

01:19:43.822 --> 01:19:45.432
So who do these fuckers
known in the Caribbean?

01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:47.043
-  What happened?
- Donnie and his crew happened.

01:19:47.173 --> 01:19:49.001
10 of them.
They had a lot of firepower

01:19:49.001 --> 01:19:51.177
and there's no way
they flew in with it.

01:19:51.525 --> 01:19:53.266
- Are you okay?
- No.

01:19:53.397 --> 01:19:55.529
He got away and he has my
daughter and my granddaughter.

01:19:55.529 --> 01:19:56.792
I think he's gonna try and
get off the island with them.

01:19:57.009 --> 01:19:58.794
-  How?
-  You tell me.

01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:00.273
Look, there's no
way that he's gonna

01:20:00.447 --> 01:20:02.058
get a woman and her
daughter off the island

01:20:02.188 --> 01:20:04.756
as hostages with no
significant help.

01:20:04.756 --> 01:20:06.149
Leave it with me.

01:20:12.677 --> 01:20:13.896
Yeah.

01:20:13.896 --> 01:20:15.593
It appears
Rambo's personal trainer

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.986
is just as good as you say.

01:20:18.248 --> 01:20:19.815
Yeah, two no mustard please.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:21.338
- Yep.
- I told you not to engage.

01:20:21.338 --> 01:20:22.774
Did you engage?

01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:25.690
Against council,
yes, and he was no letdown.

01:20:25.995 --> 01:20:28.475
This guy didn't disappoint
after all your hype.

01:20:28.693 --> 01:20:30.129
Damage?

01:20:30.129 --> 01:20:31.348
He killed
10 of Donnie's men.

01:20:31.478 --> 01:20:33.698
Jesus H.

01:20:33.698 --> 01:20:35.091
Who's got the drive?

01:20:35.091 --> 01:20:36.483
Your boy still
has it, but the good news

01:20:36.657 --> 01:20:39.704
is Donnie made it out of
there with some insurance.

01:20:39.791 --> 01:20:41.837
I need transport
off the island ASAP.

01:20:43.055 --> 01:20:44.361
What?

01:20:44.491 --> 01:20:47.277
If that drive
falls into the wrong hands

01:20:47.364 --> 01:20:48.887
I can only imagine

01:20:48.887 --> 01:20:51.368
the collateral damage
that will follow.

01:20:51.498 --> 01:20:53.152
Are you threatening me?

01:20:53.283 --> 01:20:54.284
Yes, of course.

01:20:54.414 --> 01:20:56.373
I'm a criminal.

01:20:56.503 --> 01:21:00.812
Get them off the island or
I will nail you to a cross

01:21:00.812 --> 01:21:02.988
and you will learn
about sacrifice.

01:21:08.124 --> 01:21:09.081
Okay.

01:21:09.299 --> 01:21:10.213
No mustard right?

01:21:12.345 --> 01:21:14.217
It's like you
don't even know me.

01:21:14.304 --> 01:21:15.174
What?

01:21:18.177 --> 01:21:19.178
"No mustard."

01:21:19.309 --> 01:21:20.658
What is this, Russia?

01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:27.621
Sir.

01:21:27.752 --> 01:21:30.711
No, I don't believe he's
aware of anything, sir.

01:21:32.191 --> 01:21:35.412
Yes sir, I'm quite sure
he's feeding the intel.

01:21:37.196 --> 01:21:38.110
I don't believe so.

01:21:40.112 --> 01:21:42.898
You can count on me, sir.

01:21:48.729 --> 01:21:49.730
Who was that?

01:21:51.123 --> 01:21:52.385
My dad.

01:21:52.559 --> 01:21:55.084
He's worried my mom's
gonna vote Republican.

01:21:55.084 --> 01:21:56.694
Thank God my parents are dead.

01:22:11.143 --> 01:22:12.101
I need help!

01:22:12.231 --> 01:22:13.276
I need help!

01:22:18.672 --> 01:22:20.979
- He has two gunshot wounds.
- Who are you?

01:22:21.153 --> 01:22:22.154
I'm his friend.

01:22:22.154 --> 01:22:23.155
You're gonna have to go inside

01:22:23.155 --> 01:22:24.026
and report this to the police.

01:22:24.113 --> 01:22:25.244
Of course.

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:27.159
I just gotta move my car
out of the emergency zone.

01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:28.378
Quickly!

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.597
-  All right.
- Yeah, here we go.

01:22:30.597 --> 01:22:32.730
-  That's it.
-  Yeah, I got your arm.

01:22:33.165 --> 01:22:34.732
There you go, yeah.

01:22:34.819 --> 01:22:35.689
Easy.

01:22:39.171 --> 01:22:40.868
Well you were right.

01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:43.393
Three flights just
left headed to Miami

01:22:43.567 --> 01:22:46.135
and Donnie was spotted on
one of the cargo flights.

01:22:46.135 --> 01:22:47.266
I think he must have gotten

01:22:47.397 --> 01:22:49.051
your family on
that plane somehow

01:22:49.138 --> 01:22:51.836
and he must have
some agency help.

01:22:51.836 --> 01:22:53.316
Do you still have
the hard drive?

01:22:53.316 --> 01:22:54.404
Yes.

01:22:54.404 --> 01:22:56.058
There's a 6 PM flight.

01:22:56.145 --> 01:22:59.931
I booked you on it, now I
cannot help you officially.

01:22:59.931 --> 01:23:01.933
You understand that right?

01:23:01.933 --> 01:23:03.152
Got it.

01:23:03.152 --> 01:23:04.283
When you get to
Miami there'll be

01:23:04.414 --> 01:23:06.590
a car there waiting for you.

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:07.634
Check the trunk.

01:23:07.939 --> 01:23:08.853
Copy.

01:23:12.465 --> 01:23:13.727
You think he bought it?

01:23:15.425 --> 01:23:20.082
I think he is pissed off
and he wants his family back.

01:23:20.082 --> 01:23:22.475
And you better have
your information right.

01:23:22.649 --> 01:23:23.650
You saw the surveillance.

01:23:23.824 --> 01:23:25.609
All three on their way to Miami.

01:23:25.739 --> 01:23:28.873
I do not know how the hell
he got on that cargo flight.

01:23:29.874 --> 01:23:31.180
I don't know.

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.443
This ends tonight.

01:23:33.617 --> 01:23:34.661
I don't want any more surprises.

01:23:34.835 --> 01:23:37.099
I'm sick of Hector
and her people

01:23:37.186 --> 01:23:39.318
always being one
step ahead of us.

01:23:39.449 --> 01:23:41.016
Well like you said, Chief.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.801
I think she's got
someone on the inside.

01:23:51.852 --> 01:23:53.767
May I offer you a
drink from the bar?

01:23:55.073 --> 01:23:57.249
Double Absolut on the rocks.

01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.163
Okay.

01:24:02.254 --> 01:24:03.386
You're late!

01:24:04.561 --> 01:24:06.998
This guy's file reads
like episodes of G.I. Joe.

01:24:07.477 --> 01:24:09.044
Seen half of this stuff?

01:24:09.131 --> 01:24:11.698
I wrote half of the reports.

01:24:11.785 --> 01:24:13.874
He's a true blue
American hero.

01:24:14.005 --> 01:24:16.268
Exactly what we need.

01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:18.923
If he has the hard
drive, and Hector

01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:22.144
has his granddaughter
and his daughter,

01:24:22.274 --> 01:24:25.147
he's gonna do all the
heavy lifting for us

01:24:25.147 --> 01:24:28.846
by removing Hector and her men.

01:24:28.933 --> 01:24:30.587
Any update on the drop?

01:24:30.717 --> 01:24:33.633
According to my source
it's at Hector's house.

01:24:33.807 --> 01:24:35.070
After you.

01:25:57.326 --> 01:25:59.763
Welcome to my home

01:26:00.067 --> 01:26:02.157
I'm glad that you
both made it safely.

01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:06.465
Although I will say that
the unforeseen circumstances

01:26:06.596 --> 01:26:09.903
that brought you
here are unfortunate.

01:26:12.210 --> 01:26:14.038
Oh don't be scared, Sarah.

01:26:15.779 --> 01:26:18.042
I have absolutely no
intention of hurting you.

01:26:19.696 --> 01:26:23.917
Your grandfather, however, I
cannot guarantee the safety of.

01:26:26.398 --> 01:26:27.443
It's okay.

01:26:30.402 --> 01:26:34.493
You do understand that
I cannot control Donnie.

01:26:34.624 --> 01:26:36.930
I can only control
what side he's on.

01:26:46.723 --> 01:26:50.248
Welcome
to Miami International Airport.

01:26:50.248 --> 01:26:52.207
Please remember to
keep your belongings

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.470
with you at all times.

01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:58.952
All unattended baggage will
be confiscated immediately.

01:27:12.444 --> 01:27:13.228
We all set?

01:27:14.316 --> 01:27:16.405
Almost too easy.

01:27:16.405 --> 01:27:17.493
Well good.

01:27:18.668 --> 01:27:20.147
What's the ETA?

01:27:20.278 --> 01:27:23.020
We touch down in
Miami in 13 minutes, ma'am.

01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:07.847
Sarah.

01:28:07.934 --> 01:28:10.459
Sarah get back here.

01:28:10.459 --> 01:28:12.069
What are you doing?

01:28:12.069 --> 01:28:14.071
Sarah come back over here.

01:28:26.605 --> 01:28:27.432
Sarah!

01:28:37.094 --> 01:28:38.400
I have an idea.

01:28:58.202 --> 01:28:59.116
Whoa.

01:28:59.377 --> 01:29:00.857
Is he gonna be okay?

01:29:02.293 --> 01:29:03.816
It's too soon to tell.
Come on.

01:29:03.947 --> 01:29:06.123
Come on come on come on.
Come on, quick.

01:29:26.796 --> 01:29:27.753
Hey, what was that?

01:29:27.884 --> 01:29:29.233
See anything?

01:29:29.233 --> 01:29:31.104
All right, looks
like our boy's here.

01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:33.542
Go check on the girls.

01:29:34.586 --> 01:29:35.935
You guys see anything?

01:29:35.935 --> 01:29:36.806
No.

01:29:38.895 --> 01:29:40.679
Hey, there!

01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:42.159
It's coming!
Fire!

01:29:48.644 --> 01:29:50.863
I thought you fucking
had this under control.

01:29:51.037 --> 01:29:52.561
Get these lights back on.

01:29:54.606 --> 01:29:56.173
- Get out of the car!

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:57.130
Hey!

01:29:59.655 --> 01:30:01.178
Step out of the vehicle!

01:30:01.265 --> 01:30:02.962
Get out of the car!

01:30:03.963 --> 01:30:04.790
See anything?

01:30:15.497 --> 01:30:18.587
Back
back back back back.

01:30:18.717 --> 01:30:19.544
Shh.

01:30:42.132 --> 01:30:45.178
When I call you answer,
you fucking prick.

01:30:45.309 --> 01:30:47.311
Who do you think
you're fucking with?

01:30:47.311 --> 01:30:51.576
I will cut your balls off and
feed them to my fucking dogs!

01:30:52.838 --> 01:30:53.752
Fuck!

01:31:10.987 --> 01:31:12.684
- Dad!
-  Grandpa!

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:16.819
- Dad!
- Grandpa!

01:31:31.964 --> 01:31:33.575
There's more men coming.

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.762
Just stop.

01:31:49.852 --> 01:31:50.679
Come on.

01:31:52.115 --> 01:31:52.594
Come on!

01:32:55.961 --> 01:32:57.267
Shh, shh.

01:32:57.484 --> 01:33:00.096
All right, sit on that
bench and do not move.

01:33:07.886 --> 01:33:09.018
Fuck.

01:33:09.105 --> 01:33:10.236
My grandpa's kicking
your butt out there.

01:33:10.367 --> 01:33:11.760
- Sarah.
- Shut up.

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:12.978
Go kill that motherfucker.

01:33:12.978 --> 01:33:14.153
What, are you
pissing your pants?

01:33:14.327 --> 01:33:15.415
Huh Hector?

01:33:15.502 --> 01:33:16.460
You want me to kill
that motherfucker?

01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:18.418
- Shut the fuck up, Donnie.
- Fuck you.

01:33:18.418 --> 01:33:19.594
All right, you want something
done you do it yourself.

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:20.464
Come here.

01:33:24.033 --> 01:33:24.903
Watch them.

01:33:41.267 --> 01:33:42.834
Drop the gun.

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.054
Drop the fucking gun!

01:33:46.055 --> 01:33:47.404
Got you, motherfucker.

01:33:47.491 --> 01:33:49.145
Hand me the hard drive.

01:33:49.275 --> 01:33:50.799
Hand me the hard drive!

01:33:50.799 --> 01:33:52.627
My finger's on the
fucking trigger.

01:33:55.586 --> 01:33:56.413
All right.

01:33:59.416 --> 01:34:00.243
Go.

01:34:00.373 --> 01:34:01.200
Go.

01:34:04.726 --> 01:34:07.511
You know, you killed
15 of my guys.

01:34:07.685 --> 01:34:08.817
You know that right?
You motherfucker,

01:34:08.817 --> 01:34:09.948
You killed my
little brother.

01:34:10.079 --> 01:34:11.341
You know what I'm
gonna do first?

01:34:11.471 --> 01:34:13.082
I'm gonna kill your
fucking family.

01:34:13.256 --> 01:34:14.518
Right in front of your face.

01:34:14.518 --> 01:34:16.128
That's right, do something. Move.

01:34:16.259 --> 01:34:17.739
Go ahead, try to kick.

01:34:17.739 --> 01:34:20.176
Try to do one of your fucking
fancy things, motherfucker.

01:34:23.309 --> 01:34:24.397
Give me the drive.

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:29.620
Give me the goddamn

01:34:36.322 --> 01:34:37.889
All right tough
guy, it's fucking

01:34:39.761 --> 01:34:41.545
Don't move.

01:34:50.902 --> 01:34:51.816
Give me the drive.

01:34:57.648 --> 01:34:59.519
The real drive.

01:35:05.743 --> 01:35:06.962
Well Chief.

01:35:09.529 --> 01:35:10.356
You were right.

01:35:22.238 --> 01:35:23.282
Thank you.

01:35:25.589 --> 01:35:27.286
All of this for a little stick.

01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:31.856
May I borrow him for a moment?

01:35:33.771 --> 01:35:35.077
Come, walk with me.

01:35:36.382 --> 01:35:37.470
Trust him.

01:35:42.171 --> 01:35:42.867
You badly hurt?

01:35:44.303 --> 01:35:45.609
I'll heal.

01:35:45.696 --> 01:35:47.089
Yeah
you do, don't you?

01:35:48.481 --> 01:35:49.395
Are you hurt?

01:35:49.613 --> 01:35:51.354
- No.
- I'm okay.

01:35:51.484 --> 01:35:53.182
Is she hurt?

01:35:53.356 --> 01:35:54.966
Just look at me, okay?

01:35:54.966 --> 01:35:57.142
Okay, you're okay.

01:35:57.142 --> 01:35:58.535
Very brave.

01:35:58.622 --> 01:35:59.841
Brave little girl.

01:35:59.971 --> 01:36:01.930
What the hell's
going on here, man?

01:36:01.930 --> 01:36:04.193
Yes, I'm sure you
have lots of questions.

01:36:04.846 --> 01:36:07.152
I saw some of what
was on that drive.

01:36:07.152 --> 01:36:08.937
Goes pretty deep.

01:36:09.024 --> 01:36:11.156
Where does it all lead?

01:36:11.156 --> 01:36:13.768
Everywhere and nowhere.

01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:14.769
Those are the kinds of answers

01:36:14.856 --> 01:36:17.075
that make me despise authority.

01:36:17.206 --> 01:36:18.468
We've been trying
to shut down Hector's

01:36:18.598 --> 01:36:21.514
East Coast crime
organisation unit for years.

01:36:21.645 --> 01:36:23.865
Jimmy, your son-in-law,
was informing for us.

01:36:23.995 --> 01:36:25.649
About six months.

01:36:25.736 --> 01:36:28.086
Well actually he was
informing Fitzsimmons.

01:36:28.217 --> 01:36:30.523
And Fitzsimmons was
informing Hector.

01:36:30.654 --> 01:36:32.221
So every time we got
close to busting Hector

01:36:32.395 --> 01:36:35.311
and her operations Fitzsimmons
would feed her information.

01:36:36.529 --> 01:36:38.053
When Fitzsimmons
found out that Donnie

01:36:38.183 --> 01:36:41.012
had the drive, he used
Jimmy to steal it.

01:36:42.187 --> 01:36:44.059
So he could get
it back to Hector.

01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:46.061
His partner got
shot and the whole

01:36:46.191 --> 01:36:47.584
operation went upside down.

01:36:48.628 --> 01:36:50.108
Jimmy got caught.

01:36:50.282 --> 01:36:51.893
The drive landed
on your doorstep.

01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:57.463
When you reached out to
Drisdale that you had the drive

01:36:57.550 --> 01:37:00.075
we figured you were the perfect
way to expose Fitzsimmons.

01:37:00.205 --> 01:37:02.642
And wipe out Hector and her men.

01:37:02.773 --> 01:37:04.340
So you used me.

01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:05.907
Of course.

01:37:06.037 --> 01:37:07.256
Why?

01:37:07.386 --> 01:37:08.692
Politics.

01:37:08.866 --> 01:37:11.216
I'm running for the Governor
of the state of Florida.

01:37:11.695 --> 01:37:13.915
This drive gives me
the leverage I need.

01:37:13.915 --> 01:37:16.700
Plus now that I've
taken down the entire

01:37:16.787 --> 01:37:18.702
East Coast crime
organisation run by Hector

01:37:18.789 --> 01:37:21.313
and her men, all I
have to do is hold

01:37:21.487 --> 01:37:24.447
a press conference
and take credit.

01:37:24.447 --> 01:37:26.362
Then I begin my run for office.

01:37:27.885 --> 01:37:30.845
So you're gonna use that
drive for your own benefit.

01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:32.324
Yes I am.

01:37:32.498 --> 01:37:35.023
But isn't it reassuring to
know that we're the good guys?

01:37:42.073 --> 01:37:43.292
What about them?

01:37:43.466 --> 01:37:44.641
I just got my family back.

01:37:44.728 --> 01:37:46.425
I'm not letting them go now.

01:37:46.643 --> 01:37:48.297
They'll be taken care of.

01:37:48.297 --> 01:37:49.951
You have my word.

01:37:49.951 --> 01:37:52.649
When we're done here I'll
send them down to Cayman.

01:37:52.736 --> 01:37:54.607
I can explain them, but not you.

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:56.696
Okay.

01:37:58.307 --> 01:37:59.525
What about me?

01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:02.267
Why don't you take this boat.

01:38:03.225 --> 01:38:04.879
Hector won't be
needing it anymore.

01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:08.186
Grand Cayman is about
380 nautical miles

01:38:08.317 --> 01:38:09.274
in that direction.

01:38:10.275 --> 01:38:12.321
What if I go to the press?

01:38:12.495 --> 01:38:13.888
It's a pretty good story, no?

01:38:18.109 --> 01:38:19.241
Fake news, my dear boy.

01:38:20.285 --> 01:38:21.678
Fake news.

01:38:42.873 --> 01:38:48.139
♪ Ooh the Milky Way has
gone a little sour ♪

01:38:48.792 --> 01:38:53.928
♪ The leaves dried and
the flower fell away ♪
