WEBVTT

00:03.849 --> 00:05.087
They're breaking in.

00:05.187 --> 00:06.647
We know who might
have her.

00:06.747 --> 00:08.463
He's the highest end
mercenary in the world.

00:08.563 --> 00:09.768
It's about a clock. 1938.

00:09.868 --> 00:12.283
The church has appointed
12 new apostles

00:12.383 --> 00:15.054
And entrust them
with the ultimate secret.

00:15.154 --> 00:16.996
They call themselves
"the shepherds."

00:17.096 --> 00:20.372
Their mission is to protect
the holiest of relics.

00:20.472 --> 00:23.877
I saw something--
something I can't explain.

00:25.758 --> 00:28.429
Plane blows up.
Your husband's on it.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.438
And suddenly you just wanna put
a bullet in the bomber's head.

00:31.872 --> 00:33.364
You didn't know
any of their names.

00:33.464 --> 00:35.021
They were just
collateral damage.

00:35.121 --> 00:39.354
So you're right, and maybe he
wasn't just collateral damage.

00:46.712 --> 00:49.828
3 is the number
<i>of the trinity--</i>

00:49.928 --> 00:52.949
<i>The son, the spirit, and god.</i>

00:53.049 --> 00:58.236
<i>As man grows near the truth,</i>
<i>he'll find all he knows</i>

00:58.336 --> 00:59.289
<i>Is a fraud.</i>

01:13.715 --> 01:15.530
Godspeed.

01:23.045 --> 01:24.095
They're here.

01:30.563 --> 01:32.723
I always knew you were
a devout man,

01:32.823 --> 01:34.698
But not this devout.

01:34.798 --> 01:36.481
Church before reich?

01:36.581 --> 01:38.267
That's a capital offense.

01:42.089 --> 01:44.059
What's in the box, hmm?

01:44.159 --> 01:47.690
That a man would turn traitor
against the fuhrer?

01:47.790 --> 01:49.664
Against the most
powerful country

01:49.764 --> 01:50.715
The world has ever known?

01:50.815 --> 01:52.915
You don't know
what power is.

01:54.509 --> 01:57.310
Said on the wrong end
of a--

02:00.749 --> 02:02.405
Sorry I'm late.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.032
And the other clocks?
Delivered safely?

02:11.132 --> 02:14.439
Going to the other ten apostles
as we speak.

02:14.539 --> 02:15.968
How long do we stay hidden?

02:16.068 --> 02:18.325
Till the storm out there
is past.

02:18.425 --> 02:21.381
They say the reich
will last a thousand years.

02:21.481 --> 02:23.038
Then we'll be patient,

02:23.138 --> 02:25.139
Pass down what we know

02:25.239 --> 02:27.528
From one generation
to the next.

02:27.628 --> 02:30.617
We are 2
in a chain of 12.

02:30.717 --> 02:33.483
If any one of us weakens
or falls,

02:33.583 --> 02:36.540
The whole chain comes undone,

02:36.640 --> 02:40.810
And what we have back there
is lost forever.

02:52.275 --> 02:53.704
What do you think?

02:53.804 --> 02:57.528
I think they should have
brought more trucks.

03:13.293 --> 03:16.727
Did you really mean
that if any of us falls,

03:16.827 --> 03:18.928
The whole chain
comes undone?

03:35.361 --> 03:37.013
I've gotta get you
to a hospital.

03:37.113 --> 03:40.133
Your concern for me
is heartwarming.

03:40.233 --> 03:43.859
I'm taking you
to a hospital now, okay?

03:43.959 --> 03:45.865
I'm not that stupid.

03:45.965 --> 03:47.490
I go to the hospital,
I lose you.

03:47.590 --> 03:49.209
I lose you,
I have nothing to bargain with.

03:49.309 --> 03:54.020
And right now I'm very much
in a bargaining mind-set.

03:56.283 --> 03:57.553
Hello?
Hank.

03:57.653 --> 03:58.508
Hank, honey.

03:58.608 --> 04:00.419
Laila, talk to me.

04:00.519 --> 04:01.883
I love you. Listen,

04:01.983 --> 04:03.062
You have to list--

04:03.162 --> 04:04.240
Are you okay?

04:04.340 --> 04:06.151
Oh, I'm sweet
as a georgia peach,

04:06.251 --> 04:08.062
Brother.
Put her back on.

04:08.162 --> 04:09.972
You want her,
I want the clock.

04:10.072 --> 04:10.927
It's yours.

04:11.027 --> 04:12.615
Just tell me
where to meet you.

04:12.715 --> 04:15.257
Thing is, I'm, uh,
a bit indisposed.

04:15.357 --> 04:20.958
As such, uh, I won't have time
to hunt down clocks.

04:21.058 --> 04:23.601
So I'm gonna let you
do that for me.

04:23.701 --> 04:24.557
What?

04:24.657 --> 04:26.531
The clock
you currently have,

04:26.631 --> 04:29.683
And the next one.
I give you my word, hank.

04:29.783 --> 04:32.072
If you do this,

04:32.172 --> 04:34.811
You get your wife.

04:34.911 --> 04:35.766
Your word?

04:35.866 --> 04:37.963
I don't lie, brother.

04:38.063 --> 04:39.237
Two clocks,

04:39.337 --> 04:42.931
Or two bullets
to her temple.

04:43.031 --> 04:43.887
It's your choice.

04:43.987 --> 04:44.842
I-I-I need time.

04:44.942 --> 04:46.688
I'll give you three days.

04:46.788 --> 04:48.344
No, that's not enough.

04:48.444 --> 04:50.448
Oh, let's pray you're wrong
about that, brother.

04:52.425 --> 04:54.332
I need access

04:54.432 --> 04:56.401
To the case files
on russiyana 71.

04:56.501 --> 04:57.994
Ugh.
My husband was
on that flight.

04:58.094 --> 04:59.682
It is my right.
Your right?

04:59.782 --> 05:02.547
You're given intel
as it best serves the bureau,

05:02.647 --> 05:06.401
I thought we stopped having this
conversation three years ago.

05:06.501 --> 05:09.871
Vincent told me that my husband
was a target of the bombing.

05:09.971 --> 05:13.025
My husband was a doctor,
a volunteer.

05:13.125 --> 05:15.253
Vincent's profile--
what does it tell us?

05:15.353 --> 05:17.292
That he's
a master manipulator.

05:17.392 --> 05:19.394
He lies.
He plays head games.

05:19.494 --> 05:22.100
So your vision
when it comes to him is clouded.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.520
Huh? Where is he
right now?

05:24.620 --> 05:27.673
I'm gonna tell you this
one last time--

05:27.773 --> 05:30.348
The files on russiyana 71
are closed.

05:30.448 --> 05:33.119
There are no answers
to vincent there.

05:33.219 --> 05:34.583
You want answers
about your husband?

05:34.683 --> 05:36.589
Go out there.
Get vincent yourself,

05:36.689 --> 05:38.213
And get them from him...

05:38.313 --> 05:40.730
In the real world,

05:40.830 --> 05:43.308
Not in the past.

05:43.408 --> 05:44.709
Come on.

05:44.809 --> 05:45.665
What are you hiding?

05:45.765 --> 05:47.194
No diamonds, no codes,

05:47.294 --> 05:48.658
Nothing glow-in-the-dark.

05:48.758 --> 05:49.678
Here's what I don't get--

05:49.778 --> 05:52.671
If these people,
these <i>shepherds,</i>

05:52.771 --> 05:55.313
Are trying to keep something
so important hidden,

05:55.413 --> 05:56.651
Then why leave a trail
of clues behind

05:56.751 --> 05:58.498
Buried in all these clocks?

05:58.598 --> 05:59.900
Maybe it's like
a child-proof cap--

06:00.000 --> 06:00.887
They're just trying to keep
the wrong people

06:00.987 --> 06:01.843
From opening it.

06:01.943 --> 06:02.798
Whoa.

06:02.898 --> 06:04.295
What happened?

06:04.395 --> 06:06.874
This gear...

06:06.974 --> 06:08.912
There's something
wrong with it.

06:09.012 --> 06:10.568
It's not supposed
to bend like that.

06:10.668 --> 06:11.905
Huh. I thought
german engineers

06:12.005 --> 06:13.752
Were all about
delivering perfection.

06:13.852 --> 06:17.637
Gold. Why would they make
a clock gear out of gold?

06:17.737 --> 06:18.592
What's that?

06:18.692 --> 06:20.599
I think it's a jeweler's mark.

06:20.699 --> 06:22.445
Actually,
it's a smuggler's mark.

06:22.545 --> 06:25.376
That's how people used to
move money out of countries.

06:25.476 --> 06:28.083
They'd smuggle it out as gold in
the shape of ordinary objects.

06:28.183 --> 06:30.916
In this case, I don't think
the mark is important.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.053
I found something
far more interesting.

06:34.009 --> 06:35.884
Every gear in this clock

06:35.984 --> 06:39.163
Is made with different metal--
gold, silver, tin--

06:39.263 --> 06:41.616
Which is obviously not even
remotely functional.

06:41.716 --> 06:45.946
But, uh, why would it be
<i>inside</i> the clock?

06:46.046 --> 06:47.730
Don't ask.

06:47.830 --> 06:49.163
Anyhow...

06:49.263 --> 06:51.138
I made you a list
of all the clock gears

06:51.238 --> 06:52.826
And the corresponding metals.

06:52.926 --> 06:54.704
Thanks, tom.
You are a titan.

06:54.804 --> 06:56.933
Well, maybe the apostle's name
is a metal--

06:57.033 --> 06:59.608
Like gold--goldman--
or--or silver.

06:59.708 --> 07:01.520
Maybe it's magnesium
or radium.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.002
Hey. Hey, wait a second.
Maybe it's not about the metals.

07:04.102 --> 07:06.263
Maybe it's about the symbols.

07:06.363 --> 07:08.875
Every gear is made
of a different metal.

07:08.975 --> 07:10.181
All right, chemistry.

07:10.281 --> 07:12.123
Every metal has
a corresponding element.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.065
Every element has a symbol.

07:14.165 --> 07:15.021
Gold is "au."

07:15.121 --> 07:17.441
Silver is... "ag," I think?

07:17.541 --> 07:18.683
I don't know.
Tungsten? What is that?

07:18.783 --> 07:19.639
"w."

07:19.739 --> 07:20.657
Yeah.

07:20.757 --> 07:22.600
All right,
everybody on their feet!

07:22.700 --> 07:25.275
Anybody who's good
at boggle, word games,

07:25.375 --> 07:27.122
Words, scrabble,
anything like that,

07:27.222 --> 07:30.115
This is your chance
to earn an extra week of pay.

07:30.215 --> 07:34.226
We have one hour
to figure this out.

07:41.551 --> 07:42.569
No.

07:43.716 --> 07:45.658
"mascara war"? Sorry.

07:49.195 --> 07:51.008
Uh...

07:52.092 --> 07:53.267
No. Sorry.

07:53.367 --> 07:55.117
Thank you. Nice try.

07:59.926 --> 08:02.693
I realized if you look
inside the clock,

08:02.793 --> 08:04.413
The gears are already
in an order,

08:04.513 --> 08:06.133
So that's how
I assembled the symbols--

08:06.233 --> 08:08.074
From top to bottom.

08:08.174 --> 08:09.953
Now you just ignore
the lower-case letters,

08:10.053 --> 08:11.100
And you're left with this.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.296
Add two periods
and two commas,

08:13.396 --> 08:15.239
And you have "w. Craig,"
a name,

08:15.339 --> 08:17.405
"wismar, germany," a place.

08:17.505 --> 08:19.507
You--you are gigantic.

08:19.607 --> 08:20.813
You are... Mwah!

08:20.913 --> 08:22.723
No, no. You guys
go straight to the airport.

08:22.823 --> 08:24.124
No, I just gotta stop by

08:24.224 --> 08:26.321
And get my passport
and a couple other things.

08:26.421 --> 08:27.534
I'll be there in an hour.

08:32.152 --> 08:35.368
I think we better have
a conversation, mr. Galliston.

08:49.413 --> 08:50.459
Who are you,

08:50.559 --> 08:51.925
And what the hell
are you doing in my house?

08:52.025 --> 08:53.326
I'm a friend
of father mickle's.

08:53.426 --> 08:55.682
I believe he told you
about our meeting.

08:55.782 --> 08:57.625
I apologize
for coming to you like this,

08:57.725 --> 08:59.536
But I wanted us to speak

08:59.636 --> 09:01.033
Where I knew no one
would be watching.

09:01.133 --> 09:02.975
Watching?

09:03.075 --> 09:07.083
The shepherds have sworn
to protect the clocks

09:07.183 --> 09:09.694
And what they lead to,
by any means necessary.

09:09.794 --> 09:10.650
Here's the thing--

09:10.750 --> 09:12.433
I don't care.

09:12.533 --> 09:14.470
I just want my wife back.

09:14.570 --> 09:17.623
And if a guy with a gun is
holding it to my wife's head

09:17.723 --> 09:19.151
And he tells me
to get a clock,

09:19.251 --> 09:23.960
That I am going to get that
clock by any means necessary.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.839
There are things in the world

09:25.939 --> 09:28.451
More dangerous
than a guy with a gun.

09:28.551 --> 09:32.208
You would have me
just stand by and do nothing

09:32.308 --> 09:34.278
And watch her die?

09:34.378 --> 09:36.347
For the needs of the many,

09:36.447 --> 09:40.713
There must sometimes
be sacrifices from the few.

09:49.345 --> 09:50.522
Attagirl.

10:04.279 --> 10:05.584
You need help.

10:09.948 --> 10:10.934
You need help!

10:26.029 --> 10:27.618
You're not gonna try

10:27.718 --> 10:29.338
And take that bullet out
yourself, are you?

10:29.438 --> 10:32.713
That's madness.

10:32.813 --> 10:34.623
It's been said

10:34.723 --> 10:37.269
There's a fine line...

10:39.341 --> 10:42.906
Between genius and madness.

10:46.123 --> 10:48.985
What say...

10:49.085 --> 10:53.256
We cross that line
together, huh?

10:54.212 --> 10:56.245
We are hunting
a wounded animal here.

10:56.345 --> 10:58.380
I want every single
traffic camera

10:58.480 --> 11:01.150
In 200 miles
on a 30-second interval.

11:01.250 --> 11:04.143
You find him, you follow him.
Are we clear?

11:04.243 --> 11:06.312
Paige, you got a minute?

11:10.007 --> 11:11.882
I need to ask you a favor.

11:11.982 --> 11:14.397
I need you to pull some of
the old files on vincent,

11:14.497 --> 11:16.181
Starting with
everything that we've got

11:16.281 --> 11:19.270
On the flight 71 bombing.

11:19.370 --> 11:21.467
Uh, I don't even come close

11:21.567 --> 11:23.283
To having authorized access
to those files.

11:23.383 --> 11:27.167
Well, find a way. They won't let
me anywhere near those files.

11:27.267 --> 11:29.141
But you,
they won't suspect.

11:29.241 --> 11:32.806
Uh, I could--
I could lose my job.

11:34.972 --> 11:37.358
You're a conspiracy girl,
right?

11:37.458 --> 11:38.728
Right? I've seen you
at the magazine

11:38.828 --> 11:40.224
With that guy arron.

11:40.324 --> 11:43.089
Somebody is
hiding something.

11:43.189 --> 11:45.956
This is
a real-life mystery, paige,

11:46.056 --> 11:47.962
Right in your wheelhouse.

11:48.062 --> 11:50.892
What do you say
we figure it out together?

11:50.992 --> 11:51.847
Uh...

11:51.947 --> 11:53.439
I can't.

11:53.539 --> 11:57.294
I can't. I'm sorry.
I can't lose my job.

12:07.104 --> 12:10.094
Town records
are in the church.

12:10.194 --> 12:12.482
Hmm. I guess
that's how you do things

12:12.582 --> 12:14.106
When you have a population
of 1,200.

12:14.206 --> 12:16.431
Did the church say they have
anything on w. Craig?

12:16.531 --> 12:19.488
The records aren't digitized,
so they have to do it by hand.

12:19.588 --> 12:24.074
We've got a holy indian woman
and... Albert einstein.

12:24.174 --> 12:25.889
Yeah, I've been thinking
the same thing.

12:25.989 --> 12:27.736
How do you become
one of the 12 apostles?

12:27.836 --> 12:31.241
To be one of the holiest people
in the world?

12:36.465 --> 12:37.862
I...

12:37.962 --> 12:39.648
I am a nobody, brother.

12:41.591 --> 12:42.543
Let me die.

12:42.643 --> 12:45.505
No. You are 1 of 12.

12:45.605 --> 12:47.829
You are more powerful
than chancellors,

12:47.929 --> 12:49.900
Presidents,
even the fuhrer.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.472
A travel agent
more powerful than the fuhrer?

12:55.572 --> 12:57.478
One who spent
five years in prison

12:57.578 --> 12:58.816
For his christian beliefs.

12:58.916 --> 13:01.302
Displayed
unsurpassed patience.

13:04.488 --> 13:06.490
You make patience
sound like a weapon.

13:06.590 --> 13:10.188
Properly wielded,
it is.

13:25.570 --> 13:26.967
We need a doctor.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.900
One that will not
report to the nazis.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.230
Go.

13:42.382 --> 13:43.780
I gather you are
the americans?

13:43.880 --> 13:45.628
That--that's right.
Did you find anything?

13:45.728 --> 13:46.584
Mm.

13:46.684 --> 13:49.035
Stay with me.

13:49.135 --> 13:51.837
You can't do this.

13:51.937 --> 13:53.843
The chain won't hold.

13:53.943 --> 13:56.649
There must be 12.

13:57.605 --> 13:59.833
I'm being patient...

14:01.808 --> 14:05.725
But I fear death is not.

14:08.527 --> 14:10.594
<i>It took a bit</i>
<i>to locate w. Craig,</i>

14:10.694 --> 14:12.950
But he's here.

14:13.050 --> 14:13.905
<i>He's</i> here?

14:14.005 --> 14:14.861
You--you mean his records?

14:14.961 --> 14:17.443
No. In this case,
I mean him.

14:19.991 --> 14:21.931
His body, anyhow.

14:22.031 --> 14:25.787
His soul, I trust,
is on high.

14:40.372 --> 14:42.758
You managed
to take care of that leg,

14:42.858 --> 14:45.148
But you've still got
a bullet in your back.

14:46.327 --> 14:49.541
Look, I know something
about bullet wounds.

14:49.641 --> 14:51.514
My father was
an e.R. Doctor.

14:51.614 --> 14:54.922
He always said to me
if a shooting victim

14:55.022 --> 14:56.100
Makes it to the e.R. Alive,

14:56.200 --> 14:57.438
It's not the bullet
that usually kills him.

14:57.538 --> 14:58.807
It's the infection.

14:58.907 --> 15:01.260
Whiskey is not
a proper antiseptic.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.838
I recognize what you're
trying to accomplish.

15:03.938 --> 15:06.736
You're endeavoring
to make a human connection

15:06.836 --> 15:09.665
To soften your capture.
It won't work.

15:09.765 --> 15:11.385
Well, that's up to you,
isn't it?

15:11.485 --> 15:16.831
Frankly, ma'am, I'm weary
of listening to you try.

15:16.931 --> 15:19.187
And I trust...

15:19.287 --> 15:22.021
This will discourage you
from any further attempts

15:22.121 --> 15:24.667
To make
human connection, huh?

15:28.871 --> 15:30.876
I'm sorry.

15:33.457 --> 15:35.683
I had no idea.
I didn't understand.

15:35.783 --> 15:39.218
Having to hide yourself
away from the world like that,

15:39.318 --> 15:41.892
The isolation
you must have gone through.

15:41.992 --> 15:43.294
I'm sorry.

15:43.394 --> 15:46.131
You are a stubborn one.

15:50.431 --> 15:52.560
Oy.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.376
Yeah?

15:54.476 --> 15:56.254
There has been
a change in plans.

15:56.354 --> 15:59.121
Your wife
managed to convinced me,

15:59.221 --> 16:01.159
Due to severity
of my injuries,

16:01.259 --> 16:03.707
I have little time to spare.

16:03.807 --> 16:05.903
Which is why I now request

16:06.003 --> 16:09.629
The clock be in my hands
by this time tomorrow.

16:09.729 --> 16:12.367
It's not here by then,
she dies.

16:12.467 --> 16:13.387
Aah!

16:13.487 --> 16:15.173
Vincent.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.485
Nothing more to say?

16:19.632 --> 16:21.159
Good.

16:33.389 --> 16:37.048
"may another
take his place of leadership.

16:37.148 --> 16:38.480
<i>Genesis</i> 52."

16:38.580 --> 16:39.627
What do you say,
we go frankenstein on it,

16:39.727 --> 16:41.347
Dig it up?
Please.

16:41.447 --> 16:44.085
If you saw a dead body,
you'd crap yourself.

16:44.185 --> 16:46.028
Death certificate.

16:46.128 --> 16:47.715
Look who paid
for the burial.

16:47.815 --> 16:50.932
Well, there's our connection.
We're in the right place.

16:51.032 --> 16:52.906
What do you say?
Two shovels, get to work?

16:53.006 --> 16:54.658
I don't think the father's
gonna go for that.

16:54.758 --> 16:58.702
And the thing is, I don't
think the clock is here, anyway.
Hmm?

16:58.802 --> 17:00.390
The epitaph.

17:00.490 --> 17:03.478
That quote--it's about
matthias, right?

17:03.578 --> 17:05.930
The 13th apostle.
The one that replaced judas.

17:06.030 --> 17:09.242
And our guy dies right when this thing is started.
And the new apostles

17:09.342 --> 17:10.707
Are supposed
to go out into the world,

17:10.807 --> 17:12.872
Stay hidden. You can't
do that if you're dead.

17:12.972 --> 17:15.038
They would have needed
a replacement.

17:15.137 --> 17:16.663
Where the hell
do you find a replacement

17:16.762 --> 17:19.277
In the middle
of nazi germany?

17:34.021 --> 17:35.960
This a fisherman's bar?

17:36.060 --> 17:39.622
I need a boat. Tonight.

17:39.722 --> 17:42.647
Most of these men
are so drunk,

17:42.747 --> 17:44.463
They would fill the bilge

17:44.563 --> 17:46.978
And put you on the seafloor
inside of an hour.

17:47.078 --> 17:48.189
Not me, sir.

17:48.289 --> 17:51.278
What is your name?

17:51.378 --> 17:53.538
Kipske, sir.
Walter kipske.

17:53.638 --> 17:55.799
You a soldier, kipske?

17:55.899 --> 17:58.793
Loyal to fatherland
and fuhrer.

17:58.893 --> 18:00.544
Loyal?
Yes, sir.

18:00.644 --> 18:05.161
Both those words don't mean
what you think they do.

18:05.261 --> 18:06.531
Sir?

18:06.631 --> 18:10.037
Your boat. Where is it?

18:14.178 --> 18:16.502
I need to make
a crossing tonight.

18:20.610 --> 18:22.262
We have got
to figure this out.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.204
We have less than 20 hours,

18:24.304 --> 18:26.370
And it's gonna take seven hours
just to fly back.

18:26.470 --> 18:27.867
I know. It's just
we usually have a clue

18:27.967 --> 18:29.300
Or a puzzle
or something to go on.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.071
All we got right now
is a-a quote from the bible.

18:32.171 --> 18:33.981
I'm not even sure
we have that.

18:34.081 --> 18:34.968
What do you mean?

18:35.068 --> 18:36.656
Well, we're talking
about matthias

18:36.756 --> 18:38.472
Being judas' replacement,
right?

18:38.572 --> 18:39.841
That would mean he'd show up
in the new testament,

18:39.941 --> 18:41.910
But <i>genes</i> is from
the old testament.

18:42.010 --> 18:44.330
All right, well, look up
<i>genesis</i> 52.

18:44.430 --> 18:46.019
I mean, maybe we've got
the wrong quote.

18:46.119 --> 18:50.222
There <i>is</i> no <i>genesis</i> 52.

18:50.322 --> 18:52.007
It doesn't exist.

18:53.984 --> 18:55.985
Oh, hold on. It's beck.

18:56.085 --> 18:58.946
Listen, I'll meet you guys
back at the hotel, okay?

18:59.046 --> 19:00.826
Don't talk to anybody
about anything.

19:00.926 --> 19:03.660
I want you to come to me,
understand?

19:03.760 --> 19:05.189
Yeah.
Yeah.

19:05.289 --> 19:06.813
Hello?

19:06.913 --> 19:08.469
You make it
to germany yet?

19:08.569 --> 19:10.316
Like you don't track me?

19:10.416 --> 19:11.940
Maybe a little.
What's in germany?

19:12.040 --> 19:13.086
Next clock.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.316
Vincent's making me
chase it down for him.

19:15.416 --> 19:16.812
Any progress?

19:16.912 --> 19:19.679
Not unless <i>genesis</i> 52
means something to you.

19:19.779 --> 19:21.779
That's a biblical passage,
isn't it?

19:21.879 --> 19:22.894
Nope.

19:22.994 --> 19:24.455
Rock band from the '80s?

19:24.555 --> 19:25.410
I'm serious, beck.

19:25.510 --> 19:27.385
So am I.

19:27.485 --> 19:28.722
Look, if I've learned
anything from you

19:28.822 --> 19:30.410
Solving these riddles,
it's that the answer

19:30.510 --> 19:31.938
Is never
what you think it is.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.136
<i>Genesis</i> 52,
it could be anything.

19:34.236 --> 19:36.908
A street address?

19:38.407 --> 19:39.613
Hank?

19:39.713 --> 19:40.886
You there?

19:40.986 --> 19:42.800
I'll call you back.

20:08.660 --> 20:09.770
Oh!

20:09.870 --> 20:12.381
If you don't remove
the bullet,

20:12.481 --> 20:13.305
You'll bleed out!

20:13.405 --> 20:14.992
Do you understand?
Oh, shut up.

20:15.092 --> 20:17.062
God, let me help you!

20:17.162 --> 20:20.660
Help me?!
Lose the halo, will you?

20:20.760 --> 20:22.157
You're only trying
to help yourself.

20:22.257 --> 20:24.419
Ugh!
You know full well

20:24.519 --> 20:28.909
If die, so do you,
tied to that pole.

20:29.009 --> 20:32.220
You'd die of dehydration
next to my body.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.404
That's what
you're really scared of.

20:35.504 --> 20:38.433
People are only in it
for themselves.

20:40.216 --> 20:42.668
Aah!

20:45.153 --> 20:46.840
Hello?

20:49.547 --> 20:51.266
Anybody here? Hello!

21:22.125 --> 21:24.894
Uhh!

21:34.862 --> 21:37.247
There are tools
in the clock-making kit.

21:37.347 --> 21:39.381
They're fine enough.

21:39.481 --> 21:43.010
I could remove that bullet.

21:43.110 --> 21:45.240
How did he ever
live with you?

21:45.340 --> 21:47.947
Your determination
is grating.

21:48.047 --> 21:50.145
You've taken me
from my husband,

21:50.245 --> 21:51.928
Robbed me
of my dignity,

21:52.028 --> 21:55.462
But the one thing you can't have
is my sense of grace--

21:55.562 --> 21:57.500
The instinct
to act with kindness

21:57.600 --> 21:59.506
Where no kindness
is warranted,

21:59.606 --> 22:02.532
To love one's enemy.

22:02.632 --> 22:04.474
And I...

22:04.574 --> 22:09.888
Most assuredly...

22:09.988 --> 22:11.512
Your enemy.

22:11.612 --> 22:15.811
If you made me hate you,
you'd win.

22:15.911 --> 22:20.750
And like hell
I'm gonna let you win.

22:46.066 --> 22:50.777
If you try anything...

22:50.877 --> 22:53.452
Anything...

22:53.552 --> 22:56.827
My reaction will have
no grace in it.

22:56.927 --> 23:00.235
A dying man doesn't just
disappear into thin air.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.463
Somebody somewhere
must have something.

23:02.563 --> 23:04.438
Vincent's got
two bullets in him.

23:04.538 --> 23:06.093
I put 'em there.
Check the hospitals.

23:06.193 --> 23:09.249
Well, check them again.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.960
Beck?

23:14.060 --> 23:16.538
I got nothing, paige.

23:16.638 --> 23:18.545
Right when I should be closest,
I'm furthest away.

23:18.645 --> 23:19.821
Maybe not.

23:23.613 --> 23:25.264
I can't help you
with vincent,

23:25.364 --> 23:27.271
But I thought about it,
and what it must be like

23:27.371 --> 23:28.993
To lose someone
and not know the truth.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.750
Thank you, paige.

23:39.821 --> 23:41.377
Hank's still not answering.

23:41.477 --> 23:42.524
Well, he's gotta
be around here somewhere.

23:42.624 --> 23:43.673
Try him again.

23:52.113 --> 23:53.131
Oh!

23:55.296 --> 23:56.981
Why are you on my boat?

23:57.081 --> 24:00.707
You're a shepherd.

24:00.807 --> 24:04.242
I know--
I know about the clocks.

24:04.342 --> 24:05.677
Ooh!

24:11.348 --> 24:12.967
What's in the box?

24:13.067 --> 24:14.402
Best you don't know.

24:17.907 --> 24:19.594
Start the boat.

24:25.518 --> 24:26.820
Who are they after?

24:26.920 --> 24:30.036
Start the damn boat.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.363
Help me here first.

24:34.212 --> 24:35.994
What are you doing?
It's you they're
looking for, isn't it?

24:37.969 --> 24:39.271
<i>Who are you?</i>

24:39.371 --> 24:41.089
Who are you?

24:42.491 --> 24:43.507
Uhh!

24:43.607 --> 24:44.815
<i>Who are you?!</i>

24:46.695 --> 24:51.181
Someone who's
come from far away...

24:51.281 --> 24:52.901
In good will...

24:53.001 --> 24:55.003
To find an apostle.

24:55.103 --> 24:56.913
A clock.

24:57.013 --> 24:59.843
That means nothing
to me, you understand?

24:59.943 --> 25:00.829
Why did you come here?

25:00.929 --> 25:03.951
Look for yourself.

25:04.051 --> 25:05.704
In there.

25:19.049 --> 25:20.000
You're a traitor.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.803
You're a traitor
to your country!

25:22.903 --> 25:24.873
There's a higher calling
than country.

25:24.973 --> 25:26.592
A higher calling
than the reich?

25:26.692 --> 25:29.267
You should burn for that!

25:29.367 --> 25:31.181
And you will.

25:32.329 --> 25:35.191
You call out now,
I will burn.

25:35.291 --> 25:36.560
But only for a brief moment.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.121
Then I'll be dead.

25:38.221 --> 25:41.339
You, though,
would burn forever.

25:45.003 --> 25:48.377
You want to know
what's in the box?

26:11.848 --> 26:13.279
You!

26:15.574 --> 26:17.674
Have you seen any soldiers
on the docks?

26:19.140 --> 26:20.951
Speak up!
Have you seen any soldiers?

26:21.051 --> 26:23.817
What are you doing
out here so late, boy?

26:23.917 --> 26:25.728
I need to ready the boat
for my father.

26:25.828 --> 26:28.819
They're heading out
on the morning tide.

26:46.749 --> 26:47.828
Where did you get this?

26:47.928 --> 26:49.869
Where did you get this?

26:53.087 --> 26:55.471
I said,
where did you get this?

26:55.571 --> 26:58.336
I know about the clocks,

26:58.436 --> 27:01.107
About the new apostles,

27:01.207 --> 27:04.197
How one leads to the next.

27:04.297 --> 27:08.339
The next clock is here,
right?

27:12.034 --> 27:13.462
I've come too far.

27:13.562 --> 27:15.437
Too much on the line.

27:15.537 --> 27:18.081
You've got to tell me!
You?!

27:18.181 --> 27:20.500
How do I know
you didn't steal this, huh?

27:20.600 --> 27:22.985
These clocks belong
only to the 12.

27:23.085 --> 27:24.927
Now you are either
one of the 12...

27:25.027 --> 27:26.742
Or you are a thief.

27:26.842 --> 27:29.672
I'm--I'm not a thief.

27:29.772 --> 27:33.367
Ah. So then he's one of
the 12.

27:33.467 --> 27:34.768
Good-bye, thief.

27:34.868 --> 27:37.379
Stop.

27:37.479 --> 27:40.756
No. I know that face
anywhere.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.552
Can it really be you?

27:52.764 --> 27:56.040
Ah!

27:56.140 --> 27:58.622
Oh! Got it. I got it.

28:03.431 --> 28:06.006
Lucky for you I value life
above all else,

28:06.106 --> 28:09.223
Even if that life tries
really hard not to warrant it.

28:09.323 --> 28:12.824
I'm fully aware
of your true motives.

28:14.290 --> 28:15.560
True motives?

28:15.660 --> 28:20.178
I counted seven tools
when we began,

28:20.278 --> 28:24.190
And all capable
to cut through your binds.

28:24.290 --> 28:25.305
And now...

28:25.405 --> 28:29.444
Still seven.

28:29.544 --> 28:32.918
What? You thought
I planned on escaping?

28:34.703 --> 28:37.759
I would have.

28:45.179 --> 28:47.216
Thank you.

29:28.392 --> 29:29.694
If I knew less,

29:29.794 --> 29:32.146
I'd say it's a ghost
I'm seeing.

29:32.246 --> 29:37.274
But I know it's the work
of the holy ghost,

29:37.374 --> 29:40.142
Even if I don't know how.

29:42.182 --> 29:43.483
You have suffered.

29:43.583 --> 29:46.734
For that I am deeply sorry.

29:50.588 --> 29:51.444
Thank you.

29:51.544 --> 29:54.469
No, it is I
who should thank you

29:54.569 --> 29:57.336
For setting me
on the path of righteousness.

29:57.436 --> 29:58.291
Uh...

29:58.391 --> 30:02.242
I-I'm not korbin sturm.

30:15.459 --> 30:18.353
This is where
you wanted to come?

30:18.453 --> 30:20.901
There is nothing here.

30:21.001 --> 30:22.970
Patience.

30:23.070 --> 30:24.594
You see nothing now.

30:24.694 --> 30:27.811
Even in darkness,
when there's no way forward,

30:27.911 --> 30:30.393
You must have patience.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.237
What's this?

30:37.337 --> 30:39.911
It's 1 of 12
that will one day

30:40.011 --> 30:43.893
Lead those sworn to protect them
to this holy relic,

30:43.993 --> 30:46.598
Its new resting place.

30:46.698 --> 30:48.351
I-I'm not ready
for this.

30:48.451 --> 30:49.624
You have to be.

30:49.724 --> 30:54.210
Fate, in this moment,
has chosen you.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.854
Now you've got to learn

30:56.954 --> 31:01.791
One of the most noble
and difficult of virtues--

31:03.226 --> 31:04.145
Patience.

31:04.245 --> 31:08.380
But when will I know?

31:08.480 --> 31:09.593
You'll know.

31:33.987 --> 31:36.723
You counseled patience.

31:36.823 --> 31:40.894
For years, I didn't know
what that meant.

31:40.994 --> 31:43.378
I waited here.

31:43.478 --> 31:46.563
I kept this slip, I kept this
boat afloat,

31:46.663 --> 31:47.964
Not knowing for what.

31:48.064 --> 31:50.578
Now I do.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.072
You said something to me,

31:57.172 --> 32:00.129
That I didn't know
what death meant.

32:00.229 --> 32:06.051
Only now do I realize...

32:06.151 --> 32:08.856
How right you were.

32:11.469 --> 32:12.484
Hey, we thought
we'd lost you, man.

32:12.584 --> 32:14.013
We're at the dock.
What slip is it?

32:14.113 --> 32:16.022
Oh, hey,
there you are.

32:18.156 --> 32:19.330
Oh, my god!

32:19.430 --> 32:20.445
No, I'm--I'm okay.

32:20.545 --> 32:22.135
Well, you don't look okay.

32:24.907 --> 32:26.687
I'm okay.

32:26.787 --> 32:27.769
Yeah.
So listen--

32:27.869 --> 32:28.884
I booked a flight.

32:28.984 --> 32:30.890
I'm heading back
to n.Y.C. Tonight.

32:30.990 --> 32:33.343
But there's only one seat,
so you guys will go tomorrow.

32:33.443 --> 32:35.667
Someone has offered
to put you up for the night.

32:35.767 --> 32:38.409
He's gonna keep an eye
on you.

32:41.530 --> 32:44.013
I couldn't think
of better hands.

33:22.228 --> 33:24.328
The clocks.

33:28.247 --> 33:29.230
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

33:29.330 --> 33:30.854
<i>Welcome to new york city.</i>

33:30.954 --> 33:35.121
<i>You are now free to use your</i>
<i>personal electronic devices,</i>

33:35.221 --> 33:40.729
<i>And the pilot has turned off</i>
<i>the "fasten seat belt" sign.</i>

34:32.860 --> 34:34.384
Oh.

34:34.484 --> 34:36.391
We did it.

34:44.706 --> 34:46.708
Ohh.

34:46.808 --> 34:48.554
Shh.

34:48.655 --> 34:50.723
Sweetie, it's okay.

35:04.799 --> 35:07.439
What are you thinking?

35:07.539 --> 35:10.145
Just about
all the empty promises

35:10.245 --> 35:11.611
People make
when they're in love.

35:11.711 --> 35:13.075
You know,

35:13.175 --> 35:15.050
"I'd do anything.
Go to the ends of the earth.

35:15.150 --> 35:17.155
Slay dragons."

35:19.098 --> 35:22.438
but you...

35:22.538 --> 35:25.495
You did those things
for me.

35:25.595 --> 35:28.491
Thank you, my love.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.041
Those clocks--

35:43.141 --> 35:46.353
What are we gonna
do with them?

35:46.453 --> 35:49.696
Get rid of them.

35:49.796 --> 35:52.598
He'll come for them.
He'll kill you.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.931
Something is going on,
laila.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.810
Something I can't explain.

36:00.910 --> 36:04.186
That man that
I saw in the sub--

36:04.286 --> 36:07.530
I'm telling you
he had my face.

36:07.630 --> 36:11.288
People know things about me
that I don't.

36:11.388 --> 36:13.484
It's all attached
to the clocks.

36:13.584 --> 36:16.512
Hank, he will <i>kill</i> you.

36:17.564 --> 36:19.917
I love you.
That's all you need to know.

36:20.017 --> 36:21.350
Just let this go.

36:21.450 --> 36:26.509
I've spent 20 years
running that magazine,

36:26.609 --> 36:29.503
Searching for the great story,
the big secret.

36:29.603 --> 36:31.350
And it wasn't there.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.611
And now I'm wondering
if it finally is.

36:33.711 --> 36:36.190
There's no big secret, okay?

36:36.290 --> 36:38.069
There's just you and me.

36:38.169 --> 36:41.763
Two of the most boring
but content people in the world.

36:41.863 --> 36:44.058
That is what's real.

36:44.983 --> 36:46.765
See it, please.

36:50.779 --> 36:52.558
I see it.

36:52.658 --> 36:57.175
I see it. I see it.
Right here, I see it.

36:57.275 --> 36:58.611
Mmm.

37:11.732 --> 37:14.690
You see this f.A.A.
Joint investigation file?

37:14.790 --> 37:15.901
No. Find something?

37:16.001 --> 37:18.130
Ah, more curious
than anything.

37:18.230 --> 37:19.976
You've heard
of lucky people

37:20.076 --> 37:24.785
Who miss planes and boats
that later crashed or sank?

37:24.885 --> 37:27.714
Sure. 9/11. Titanic.

37:27.814 --> 37:29.275
He called me that day--
my husband,

37:29.375 --> 37:31.409
On his way to the airport,

37:31.509 --> 37:34.720
Convinced that he was
gonna miss that flight.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.302
Told him to hang tough.

37:38.323 --> 37:40.296
He wasn't gonna make it.

37:42.718 --> 37:44.404
I guess the traffic
eased up.

37:45.838 --> 37:47.172
Why couldn't it have
been him?

37:47.272 --> 37:48.923
Why couldn't he have been
the lucky one

37:49.023 --> 37:50.677
That missed flight 71?

37:53.862 --> 37:55.008
There was a lucky one.

37:57.748 --> 37:59.209
What do you mean?
The flight was full.

37:59.309 --> 38:00.451
The flight was booked full.

38:00.551 --> 38:02.648
But someone didn't make it
in time.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.973
One seat
didn't get filled.

38:05.073 --> 38:07.807
The seat right next
to your husband's.

38:07.907 --> 38:08.797
I want the passport.

38:21.283 --> 38:24.556
Hank, call me
as soon as you get this.

38:24.656 --> 38:26.881
You have to call me.
H.Q.'s tracked his phone.

38:26.981 --> 38:29.209
- He's here in manhattan.
- The marbury hotel.

38:30.803 --> 38:35.417
You know, there's one thing
we've been tiptoeing around.

38:35.517 --> 38:39.269
You want to know
what was in the box.

38:39.369 --> 38:41.721
Uh-huh.

38:41.821 --> 38:44.113
What all these clocks
lead to.

38:49.846 --> 38:53.920
For centuries,
men have fought to control it.

38:58.031 --> 38:58.886
Where is she?

38:58.986 --> 39:00.608
What the hell
are you doing?

39:03.412 --> 39:05.223
She's gone!

39:05.323 --> 39:09.300
It came from a place
of death...

39:09.400 --> 39:11.782
<i>Yet brought eternal life,</i>

39:11.882 --> 39:15.989
Just as it did on that hilltop
2,000 years ago.

39:19.175 --> 39:22.770
<i>The true cross of christ</i>

39:22.870 --> 39:26.176
Was the last thing
the lord touched on earth

39:26.276 --> 39:31.304
Before he both died
and was born into eternity.

39:31.404 --> 39:33.088
Maybe she stepped out.

39:33.188 --> 39:35.061
She didn't step out.
She lied.

39:35.161 --> 39:37.036
What are you talking about?

39:37.136 --> 39:40.125
The clocks. Where are they?

39:40.225 --> 39:43.023
Did she take 'em?
Where are the clocks?

39:43.123 --> 39:45.157
Hank, listen to me.

39:45.257 --> 39:48.373
Everything you think you know
is a lie.

39:48.473 --> 39:49.964
What are you talking about?

39:50.064 --> 39:51.334
My husband's flight.

39:51.434 --> 39:53.850
One passenger was supposed
to be on it that wasn't.

39:53.950 --> 39:56.302
She was an australian woman
named anna massey.

39:56.402 --> 39:59.773
What does that
have to do with laila?

39:59.873 --> 40:01.495
Everything.

40:12.642 --> 40:15.122
<i>The true cross.</i>

40:15.222 --> 40:19.200
<i>It is</i>
<i>destruction and salvation.</i>

40:21.335 --> 40:24.007
<i>It is the doorway</i>

40:24.107 --> 40:25.793
<i>To god.</i>
