19:37.935 --> 19:39.108
SHE GOT JEALOUS
AND KILLED HIM.

19:39.143 --> 19:40.972
BUT YOU DIDN'T
ACCUSE HER.

19:41.007 --> 19:42.215
THAT'S 'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE
ANY EVIDENCE...

19:42.250 --> 19:44.044
YET.

19:44.079 --> 19:45.218
I GOT TO LOOK INTO HER MOVEMENTS
ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER.

19:45.253 --> 19:47.220
DROP YOU BACK AT CAMPUS?

19:49.153 --> 19:52.052
LOOK AT US -- JUST A COUPLE OF
HIGHER-ORDER PRIMATES

19:52.087 --> 19:53.916
COMPETING
FOR A SEXUAL PARTNER.

19:53.951 --> 19:55.055
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

19:55.090 --> 19:56.988
I'M TALKING ABOUT KATE,
OF COURSE.

19:57.023 --> 19:58.231
AND, WELL,
I'LL JUST SAY IT --

19:58.266 --> 20:00.889
I SENSE THAT
SHE'S VERY ATTRACTED TO ME.

20:00.923 --> 20:02.131
BUT IF YOU'RE PLANNING
TO PLANT YOUR FLAG

20:02.166 --> 20:04.996
IN THAT TERRA INCOGNITA,

20:05.031 --> 20:07.896
THEN JUST SAY THE WORD
AND I'LL GRACEFULLY WITHDRAW.

20:07.930 --> 20:10.243
LOOK, IF YOU'RE DONE
MANGLING METAPHORS,

20:10.278 --> 20:11.244
I HAVE A CLASS.

20:11.279 --> 20:14.040
SO, YOU DON'T MIND?

20:18.182 --> 20:21.047
LEWICKI?!

20:26.086 --> 20:28.088
LEWICKI!

20:29.918 --> 20:31.230
LEWI--
WHERE THE [BLEEP] WERE YOU?

20:31.264 --> 20:33.128
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BRING MY NOTES

20:33.162 --> 20:35.889
FOR THE NEUROANATOMY SEMINAR --
I HAD TO CANCEL IT!

20:35.924 --> 20:36.545
I'M SORRY, DOC.
I'M SORRY.

20:36.580 --> 20:38.098
WHAT -- WHAT HAPPENED WAS

20:38.133 --> 20:41.930
I HAD TO TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF...
TO DO THE LAUNDRY.

20:41.964 --> 20:43.138
AND, UH, I PUT MY CLOTHES
IN THE WASH,

20:43.172 --> 20:45.071
AND, UH, WHEN I CAME BACK
TO CHECK ON THEM,

20:45.105 --> 20:46.935
THE WASHER
WAS SET ON DELICATES.

20:46.969 --> 20:48.937
SO I HAD TO WASH THEM
ALL OVER AGAIN.

20:48.971 --> 20:51.250
HEY, PROFESSOR PIERCE.

21:11.235 --> 21:15.066
YEAH, I-I-I TOLD YOU
SHE WAS INTO ME.

21:16.930 --> 21:19.070
[ TELEPHONE RINGS ]

21:19.105 --> 21:21.107
UH, DR. PIERCE'S
RESIDENCE.

21:21.141 --> 21:23.143
ONE SEC.

21:23.178 --> 21:25.214
IT'S KATE.

21:25.249 --> 21:27.009
HELLO?

21:27.044 --> 21:29.909
CHICAGO P.D. PICKED UP
JUSTIN REYCRAFT --

21:29.943 --> 21:31.911
you know, the kid
who was threatening Corvis.

21:31.945 --> 21:33.222
HE WAS PANHANDLING
IN MILLENNIUM PARK.

21:33.257 --> 21:35.086
THEY'RE BRINGING HIM IN
TO TALK TO ME.

21:35.121 --> 21:36.260
You want to come say hi?

21:36.295 --> 21:39.194
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.269
SO, THEN, YOU WON'T BE BACK
FOR A WHILE?!

21:45.304 --> 21:47.098
Kate:
WHY'D YOU RUN AWAY, JUSTIN?

21:47.133 --> 21:48.928
I DIDN'T.

21:48.962 --> 21:51.171
MY DAD KICKED ME OUT.

21:51.206 --> 21:54.174
WHY --
WHY'D HE DO THAT?

21:54.209 --> 21:56.936
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T GO BACK
TO SEE THAT WEIRDO CORVIS.

21:56.970 --> 21:59.110
MR. CORVIS SAYS HERE
IN HIS FILES

21:59.145 --> 22:01.043
THAT YOU THREATENED HIM.

22:01.078 --> 22:02.148
DID YOU KILL HIM?

22:02.182 --> 22:04.081
NO, I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.151
WHAT MADE YOU SO ANGRY
AT HIM?

22:05.185 --> 22:07.118
THAT GUY
WAS A TOTAL FREAK!

22:07.153 --> 22:10.087
OKAY. WE JUST WANT TO HEAR
YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY.

22:15.057 --> 22:17.266
MY DAD FORCED ME
TO GO SEE CORVIS.

22:17.301 --> 22:20.028
AND THEN HE GIVES ME
SOME PILL.

22:20.062 --> 22:21.961
WHAT KIND OF PILL?

22:21.995 --> 22:23.134
I DON'T KNOW.

22:23.169 --> 22:25.136
MAYBE ONE OF THOSE PILLS
THEY GIVE TO OLD MEN

22:25.171 --> 22:27.138
TO MAKE THEM ALL
HOT AND BOTHERED.

22:29.002 --> 22:31.280
I GUESS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO
THE SAME THING TO ME.

22:31.315 --> 22:35.181
AND THEN HE MAKES ME
WATCH ALL THIS PORN.

22:35.215 --> 22:37.977
IT WAS GIRLS
WITH OTHER GIRLS.

22:38.011 --> 22:41.256
AND THEN HE WANTS ME TO...

22:41.290 --> 22:43.120
YOU KNOW...

22:43.154 --> 22:47.089
WHILE I'M WATCHING THE PORN
IN FRONT OF HIM.

22:47.124 --> 22:50.921
HE SAID IT WOULD HELP
RE-TEACH MY BRAIN.

22:50.955 --> 22:53.958
HE SAID IT WAS
"PART OF THE CURE."

22:53.993 --> 22:55.166
THE CURE FOR WHAT?

22:55.201 --> 22:58.273
THE CURE FOR BEING GAY.

23:05.936 --> 23:07.765
THANK YOU.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.768
WELL, JUSTIN'S ALIBI
CHECKS OUT.

23:10.803 --> 23:12.770
HE WAS AT THE MERCY SHELTER
THE NIGHT CORVIS WAS KILLED.

23:12.805 --> 23:13.944
OF COURSE
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

23:13.978 --> 23:16.049
HE'S A SWEET KID
WHOSE PHILISTINE FATHER

23:16.084 --> 23:17.672
CONVENIENTLY FAILS TO MENTION
THAT HE THREW HIS OWN SON

23:17.706 --> 23:18.776
OUT OF THE HOUSE
FOR BEING GAY.

23:18.811 --> 23:20.640
OR HOW DID HE PUT IT?

23:20.675 --> 23:22.470
"HANGING
WITH THE WRONG CROWD."

23:22.504 --> 23:24.610
HE SOUNDED PRETTY REMORSEFUL
WHEN I TALKED TO HIM

23:24.644 --> 23:26.543
AND INCREDIBLY RELIEVED
THAT JUSTIN WAS OKAY.

23:26.577 --> 23:27.682
YOU KNOW,
I THINK THERE'S A CHANCE

23:27.716 --> 23:29.649
THAT THOSE TWO
COULD WORK THINGS OUT.

23:29.684 --> 23:31.789
AT LEAST NOW WE KNOW WHAT
"TRANSFERENTIAL DOPAMINE
DEFICIENCY" IS.

23:31.824 --> 23:34.620
IT'S CORVIS' CODE
FOR HOMOSEXUALITY.

23:34.654 --> 23:37.450
IT'S SO SAD THAT SOMEONE COULD
BE SO ASHAMED OF WHO THEY ARE

23:37.485 --> 23:40.453
THAT THEY'D GO TO SOME
QUACK DOCTOR TO CURE THEM.

23:40.488 --> 23:42.766
YOU GROW UP IN A FAMILY THAT
TELLS YOU YOUR BASIC IMPULSES
ARE MORALLY REPUGNANT?

23:42.800 --> 23:45.527
YOU MIGHT TRY ANYTHING TO MAKE
YOURSELF FEEL...NORMAL.

23:45.562 --> 23:46.666
KIDS KILL THEMSELVES
BECAUSE OF IT.

23:46.701 --> 23:49.566
OKAY, BUT IS IT RELEVANT
TO WHO KILLED CORVIS?

23:51.671 --> 23:54.536
HE CREATES A DISORDER
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.

23:54.571 --> 23:56.676
THEN HE COMES UP WITH
A TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR IT.

23:56.711 --> 23:58.609
AND JUSTIN WAS PRETTY ANGRY
AT CORVIS

23:58.644 --> 24:00.473
FOR PUTTING HIM
THROUGH IT,

24:00.508 --> 24:02.475
SO MAYBE ONE OF HIS
OTHER PATIENTS IS ANGRY, TOO.

24:02.510 --> 24:04.788
WE CAN'T INTERVIEW THEM
'CAUSE OF CONFIDENTIALITY.

24:04.822 --> 24:07.687
YOUCAN'T, BUT ICAN.

24:07.722 --> 24:09.689
BECAUSE I'M...

24:09.724 --> 24:11.484
THE SPECIAL MASTER.

24:11.519 --> 24:13.624
HOW COULD I FORGET?

24:13.659 --> 24:15.557
THIS IS COMPLETELY
CONFIDENTIAL.

24:15.592 --> 24:16.696
THE ONLY WAY
I'D DIVULGE ANYTHING

24:16.731 --> 24:18.629
IS IF IT WERE RELEVANT
TO THE DOCTOR'S MURDER.

24:18.664 --> 24:20.493
WE'LL DO
WHATEVER WE CAN TO HELP.

24:21.598 --> 24:23.703
HOW DID YOU FIND
DR. CORVIS?

24:23.738 --> 24:25.498
CHURCH.

24:25.533 --> 24:26.499
A SUPPORT GROUP.

24:26.534 --> 24:27.811
MY PASTOR RECOMMENDED HIM.

24:27.845 --> 24:31.470
AND WHYDID YOU GO TO HIM?

24:31.504 --> 24:34.818
I'D BEEN STRUGGLING
WITH THESE URGES FOR YEARS.

24:34.852 --> 24:38.511
I'D TRIED EVERYTHING ALREADY --
SUPPORT GROUPS, COUNSELING.

24:38.546 --> 24:39.650
NOTHING HELPED.

24:39.685 --> 24:41.790
DR. CORVIS SAID
HIS TREATMENT WAS DIFFERENT.

24:41.825 --> 24:43.654
DIFFERENT HOW?

24:43.689 --> 24:46.485
HE SAID THE THING I'D STRUGGLED
WITH MY ENTIRE LIFE,

24:46.519 --> 24:48.763
THE THING THAT HAS GIVEN ME
SO MUCH HEARTACHE

24:48.797 --> 24:50.592
WASN'T MY FAULT.

24:51.593 --> 24:52.698
IT WASN'T A CHOICE.

24:52.732 --> 24:54.631
HE SAID IT WAS A DISEASE.

24:54.665 --> 24:57.841
A NEUROCHEMICAL DISORDER,
AND HE COULD TREAT IT.

24:59.636 --> 25:02.639
WHAT WAS
THE TREATMENT REGIMEN?

25:02.673 --> 25:04.641
FIRST,
HE WOULD GIVE ME A PILL.

25:04.675 --> 25:07.644
WE ONLY GOT IT
IN HIS OFFICE.

25:07.678 --> 25:09.577
HE PROMISED US
IT WAS SAFE,

25:09.611 --> 25:11.579
BUT HE SAID IT WASN'T APPROVED
FOR SALE YET OR SOMETHING.

25:11.613 --> 25:12.649
BUT YOU TOOK IT ANYWAY?

25:12.683 --> 25:14.513
I WAS DESPERATE.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.652
I WAS WILLING
TO TRY ANYTHING.

25:15.686 --> 25:17.619
Daniel: WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER YOU TOOK THE PILL?

25:17.654 --> 25:19.483
I GOT THIS...

25:19.518 --> 25:22.486
INCREDIBLE FEELING
OF LOVE.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.591
IT GOT ME EXCITED.

25:23.625 --> 25:24.695
I'D BECOME AROUSED.

25:24.730 --> 25:26.559
AND WE MADE LOVE.

25:26.594 --> 25:27.767
WE WOULD HAVE SEX.

25:27.802 --> 25:29.769
IN FRONT OF HIM?

25:29.804 --> 25:32.565
SOMETIMES HE WOULD
MAKE ME WATCH PORN.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.534
OTHER TIMES HE BROUGHT IN
A SEXUAL SURROGATE.

25:35.568 --> 25:38.709
HE FORCED YOU TO HAVE SEX
WITH NO.OMAN?

25:38.744 --> 25:39.848
I WANTEDTO.

25:39.883 --> 25:41.678
AND HOW DID
THE TREATMENT WORK?

25:41.712 --> 25:45.509
WE HAVEN'T HAD A TREATMENT
IN ALMOST SIX WEEKS.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.615
WE -- WE HAVEN'T
NEEDED IT.

25:47.649 --> 25:49.617
DR. CORVIS
SAVED OUR MARRIAGE.

25:49.651 --> 25:51.860
HE WAS A MIRACLE WORKER.

25:51.895 --> 25:53.724
DR. CORVIS SAVED MY LIFE.

25:55.864 --> 25:57.590
"THE SEX
WAS MIND-BLOWING."

25:57.625 --> 25:58.729
WOW, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
SOMEINTERVIEW.

25:58.764 --> 26:00.559
NO,
IT'S WHAT MISTY SAID

26:00.593 --> 26:02.630
ABOUT HER BEDROOM GYMNASTICS
WITH CORVIS, REMEMBER?

26:02.664 --> 26:03.838
HE MUST HAVE BEEN GIVING HER
THE DRUG, TOO.

26:03.872 --> 26:05.494
WHAT, VIAGRA?

26:05.529 --> 26:06.634
NO, VIAGRA ONLY AFFECTS
BLOOD FLOW.

26:06.668 --> 26:08.705
CORVIS TOLD HIS PATIENTS
THAT BEING GAY

26:08.739 --> 26:10.534
IS A NEUROCHEMICAL
DISORDER.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.605
AND SINCE THE FEELING
OF BEING IN LOVE ORIGINATES

26:12.640 --> 26:14.711
IN THE PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS
OF THE HYPOTHALAMUS...

26:14.745 --> 26:16.816
[ Laughing ] OH, DANIEL,
YOU'RE SUCH A ROMANTIC.

26:16.851 --> 26:18.715
...THE DRUG
MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING

26:18.749 --> 26:20.544
THAT AFFECTED THE BRAIN.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.546
I'M GUESSING SOME SORT OF
SELECTIVE DOPAMINE AGONIST

26:22.581 --> 26:24.548
THAT PRODUCES THE SENSATION
OF BEING IN LOVE.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.551
THEN CORVIS INCORPORATES
SOME COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL
TECHNIQUES...

26:27.586 --> 26:29.622
SO THE PATIENT EXPERIENCES
THOSE FEELINGS

26:29.657 --> 26:31.520
WHILE HAVING SEX
WITH A FEMALE,

26:31.555 --> 26:32.832
AND THAT BEHAVIOR
IMPRINTS ON THEM

26:32.867 --> 26:34.558
AND CREATES A NEW NORMAL.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.697
SOMEBODY PAID ATTENTION
IN CLASS.

26:35.732 --> 26:37.526
WAIT, SO THIS TREATMENT
ACTUALLY WORKS?

26:37.561 --> 26:39.667
TEMPORARILY, MAYBE, BUT IT'S
NOT SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH

26:39.701 --> 26:42.670
TO CREATE THE KIND OF LASTING
NEUROBIOLOGICAL CHANGES

26:42.704 --> 26:44.879
THAT COULD ACTUALLY ALTER
A PERSON'S SEXUALITY.

26:44.913 --> 26:46.570
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.779
THEORETICALLY,
BUT ETHICALLY?

26:50.609 --> 26:54.543
IF THE DRUG IS STILL IN ANY
OF THE PATIENTS' SYSTEMS,

26:54.578 --> 26:56.718
WE TEST THEIR BLOOD,
WE FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

26:56.753 --> 26:59.548
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROBABLE
CAUSE TO GET A BLOOD ORDER.

26:59.583 --> 27:00.688
PLUS, IT MIGHT BE
PRETTY DIFFICULT

27:00.722 --> 27:02.621
TO GET PERMISSION
FROM THE PATIENTS.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.623
IT'D BE AN ADMISSION THAT
THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.797
Woman: SILLY DANIEL,

27:06.832 --> 27:08.834
YOU DON'T NEED
ANYONE'S PERMISSION.

27:08.868 --> 27:10.663
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

27:10.698 --> 27:11.837
I'M JUST SAYING IT MIGHT BE
PRETTY DIFFICULT

27:11.871 --> 27:13.666
TO GET THE PATIENTS
TO COOPERATE.

27:13.701 --> 27:15.530
THAT'S TRUE,

27:15.564 --> 27:17.705
BUT YOU CAN'T REFUSE
TO COOPERATE IF YOU'RE DEAD.

27:17.739 --> 27:18.844
[ LAUGHS]

27:18.878 --> 27:20.673
DID THE MEDICAL
EXAMINER'S OFFICE

27:20.708 --> 27:22.571
KEEP SAMPLES
OF CORVIS' BLOOD?

27:22.606 --> 27:23.676
YEAH, OF COURSE.
WHY?

27:23.711 --> 27:26.575
I THINK
WE'RE GONNA FIND TRACES

27:26.610 --> 27:27.853
OF THE DRUG
IN HIS SYSTEM.

27:27.887 --> 27:29.820
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO HAVE
MIND-BLOWING SEX,

27:29.855 --> 27:30.856
JUST LIKE HIS PATIENTS.

27:30.890 --> 27:32.581
I THINK
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

27:32.616 --> 27:34.653
I THINK HE WAS TRYING
TO CURE HIMSELF.

27:35.861 --> 27:37.690
BECAUSE CORVIS WAS GAY.

27:43.903 --> 27:46.112
THE M.E. TESTED YOUR HUSBAND'S
BLOOD, MRS. CORVIS.

27:46.147 --> 27:48.874
TURNS OUT
HE WAS TREATING HIMSELF

27:48.908 --> 27:51.014
WITH A DRUG CALLED ZR-121,

27:51.048 --> 27:54.880
WHICH CAUSES FEELINGS
OF LOVE AND AROUSAL.

27:54.914 --> 27:57.054
NOW, THE FDA
HASN'T APPROVED IT YET

27:57.089 --> 27:58.884
BECAUSE OF PERVASIVE
SIDE EFFECTS

27:58.918 --> 28:00.230
LIKE HYPERTENSION,
PTOSIS, DRY MOUTH.

28:00.264 --> 28:02.025
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

28:02.059 --> 28:07.030
YOUR HUSBAND WAS TRYING TO
CURE HIMSELF OF BEING GAY.

28:07.064 --> 28:09.895
HE DIDCURE HIMSELF.

28:11.068 --> 28:13.036
JULIAN
WAS A REVOLUTIONARY.

28:13.070 --> 28:15.970
HIS METHODS WERE SAVING
MARRIAGES -- SAVING LIVES.

28:16.004 --> 28:19.042
EXCEPT BEING GAY
ISN'T A DISEASE.

28:19.076 --> 28:20.975
CLEARLY,
THAT'S A MATTER OF OPINION.

28:21.009 --> 28:26.014
MY HUSBAND OFFERED HOPE TO
PEOPLE WHO SHARED OUR BELIEFS.

28:26.049 --> 28:28.983
EXCEPT HE NEVER ACTUALLY
CURED HIMSELF.

28:29.017 --> 28:31.226
WE TRACKED
HIS CREDIT-CARD BILL

28:31.261 --> 28:33.194
AND FOUND NUMEROUS CHARGES

28:33.228 --> 28:37.888
TO A COMPANY CALLED C.K.L.
RESTAURANT AND LOUNGE GROUP.

28:37.923 --> 28:40.995
SEEMS IT'S A HOLDING COMPANY
FOR A BAR IN BOYSTOWN.

28:41.029 --> 28:43.066
WE SENT AN AGENT DOWN THERE

28:43.100 --> 28:46.000
TO SEE IF ANYONE RECOGNIZED
YOUR HUSBAND.

28:46.034 --> 28:48.071
AND TURNS OUT,
HE WAS A REGULAR.

39:43.104 --> 39:46.798
[ Chuckling ] RIGHT,
WELL, SOME OTHER TIME THEN.

39:48.731 --> 39:50.077
Kate:
SEE YOU, DANIEL.

39:50.111 --> 39:53.874
DANIEL. THERE YOU ARE.
NO, OH...

39:53.908 --> 39:54.944
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
COME ON!

39:54.978 --> 39:55.979
PLEASE,
DON'T MAKE ME.

39:56.014 --> 39:57.809
SHE'S A BIG FAN!
NO, NO, NO.

39:57.843 --> 40:03.090
I JUST WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO ALLISON BANNISTER.

40:06.921 --> 40:09.786
WOW.
YOU ARE NOT OLD.

40:09.821 --> 40:11.995
[ LAUGHS ]

40:12.030 --> 40:14.929
WELL, YOU ARE QUITE
THE OBSERVATIONAL SCIENTIST.

40:14.964 --> 40:16.759
[ CLEARS THROAT ]

40:16.793 --> 40:19.762
MRS. BANNISTER, I'M TOLD
THAT I CAN BE, UH, OVERLY BLUNT,

40:19.796 --> 40:22.005
SO FORGIVE ME IN ADVANCE
WHEN I SAY

40:22.040 --> 40:23.869
THAT I AM
ONLY HERE TONIGHT

40:23.904 --> 40:25.940
BECAUSE I'M INTERESTED
I-IN PROCURING SEX.

40:25.975 --> 40:30.876
I MEAN,
MONEY...FOR A DONATION.

40:30.911 --> 40:33.707
WHO KNOWS?

40:33.741 --> 40:36.019
IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT,
DR. PIERCE,

40:36.054 --> 40:39.057
YOU MIGHT JUST GET BOTH.

40:43.751 --> 40:45.028
WOW.

40:45.063 --> 40:47.962
NICE WORK, HMM?

40:49.757 --> 40:52.001
Daniel: IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH ME?

40:52.035 --> 40:54.693
IT'S A QUESTION
WE ALL ASK OURSELVES.

40:54.728 --> 40:58.697
WE ALL WONDER WHY WE DON'T
LOOK LIKE, ACT LIKE,

40:58.732 --> 41:00.734
FEEL LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

41:00.768 --> 41:04.876
EACH OF OUR BRAINS
HAS THE EXACT SAME PARTS --

41:04.910 --> 41:07.879
CORTEX, HYPOTHALAMUS, FORNIX,
SEPTAL NUCLEUS, SO ON.

41:07.913 --> 41:13.712
AND YET, NO TWO BRAINS
ARE EXACTLY ALIKE.

41:13.747 --> 41:17.923
SO, BEING DIFFERENT...

41:22.928 --> 41:24.930
...BEING UNIQUE...

41:26.760 --> 41:30.971
...IS UNDENIABLY
A FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC...

41:33.767 --> 41:35.976
...OF BEING HUMAN.
