01:07.480 --> 01:09.840
Durham Police this morning
are investigating the death

01:09.920 --> 01:11.400
of a prominent city resident.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.640
The officers were called
early this morning to the home

01:13.720 --> 01:15.920
of Nortel executive Kathleen Peterson,

01:16.040 --> 01:18.560
who was found dead
in her Forest Hills mansion,

01:18.640 --> 01:21.360
after apparently falling down the stairs.

01:21.520 --> 01:24.600
Kathleen Peterson's husband
is novelist Michael Peterson,

01:24.680 --> 01:27.160
well known for his books
on the Vietnam War.

01:27.240 --> 01:30.560
He is also a former columnist
for the Durham Herald Sun,

01:30.640 --> 01:34.600
and ran an unsuccessful
mayoral campaign in 1999.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.800
Durham Police have refused additional
comment on the death.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.920
Kathleen and I were in here
watching a movie.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.640
I had gone to Blockbusters
and rented a video,

02:06.920 --> 02:10.400
and we were watching
American Sweethearts,

02:10.720 --> 02:13.480
and I think it was probably
around 11 o'clock

02:14.000 --> 02:15.880
that the movie ended

02:16.160 --> 02:19.400
and we took our glasses,
left the dinner plates,

02:19.480 --> 02:21.480
as a matter of fact, on there.

02:21.560 --> 02:24.240
We would clean up the next day.
Went into the kitchen.

02:24.480 --> 02:27.040
We would talk for hours.
Kathleen and I, at nighttime,

02:27.160 --> 02:30.520
would talk two, three hours.
Talk about the movie, or...

02:31.440 --> 02:33.400
the kids or what we were going to do,

02:34.240 --> 02:36.160
and we came in here.

02:36.720 --> 02:38.160
I think there was...

02:40.720 --> 02:43.040
I'm not sure.
We probably had another bottle.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.960
I know we were drinking
two bottles that night.

02:45.480 --> 02:46.600
It was a nice night.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.680
I guess it was 55, 60 degrees.
Very nice night.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.440
Uh... and I had gone outside,

02:52.840 --> 02:54.680
and we were talking here...

02:57.840 --> 02:58.680
for...

03:02.120 --> 03:03.200
a fair amount of time.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.880
And then what we would usually do
on a nice night,

03:05.960 --> 03:07.360
we would go down to the pool,

03:07.440 --> 03:10.920
which I always, you know, think is
about the nicest place on the property.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.760
I don't know if the chairs were
like this or not,

03:27.840 --> 03:30.200
but I mean, they were
probably something like this,

03:30.280 --> 03:33.720
and she was-- We were both right here.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.600
You know, the dogs would come over,

03:36.720 --> 03:40.520
and we were just talking,

03:40.600 --> 03:43.120
and finishing our drinks.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.960
And then she said, "I got to go in,

03:47.040 --> 03:49.040
because I've got the conference call
in the morning."

03:49.400 --> 03:53.000
And she started walking out that way,

03:53.080 --> 03:54.920
and I stayed right here.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.240
Don't think I said
anything special to her.

03:58.320 --> 04:01.560
Certainly not thinking this was
the last time I'm going to see her.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.280
I said good night,
and I'll be up a little bit later,

04:04.440 --> 04:06.800
and I stayed here, and she walked...

04:11.120 --> 04:12.920
And the last I saw her was...

04:13.720 --> 04:15.800
when I was sitting there,
and she was just...

04:17.160 --> 04:18.600
walking, walking here.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.760
That's it. That was the last
I saw Kathleen.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Alive. No.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.560
She was alive when I found her, but...

04:29.560 --> 04:30.440
barely.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.080
Durham 9-1-1, what is your emergency?

04:34.600 --> 04:36.920
- 1810 Cedar Street, please!
- What's wrong?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.160
My wife's had an accident.
She's still breathing.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.520
- What kind of accident?
- She fell down the stairs.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.720
- She's still breathing. Please come.
- Is she conscious?

04:43.800 --> 04:45.080
- What?
- Is she conscious?

04:45.160 --> 04:47.040
No, she's not conscious. Please!

04:47.120 --> 04:49.320
- How many stairs did she fall down?
- What? Huh?

04:49.400 --> 04:51.000
- How many stairs?
- The back stairs!

04:51.080 --> 04:52.400
How many stairs?

04:54.200 --> 04:55.400
Calm down, sir.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.280
- Calm down.
- 15, 20. I don't know.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.240
Please! Get somebody here right away!

05:01.360 --> 05:04.800
Okay, somebody's dispatching the ambulance
while I ask you questions.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.200
It's off of, uh-- It's in Forest Hills.

05:07.280 --> 05:08.680
Okay? Please, please!

05:09.840 --> 05:11.520
It was just such a shock

05:12.040 --> 05:13.840
when I drove into the driveway.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.680
Seeing ambulances,
just like, "Oh my God.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.280
Did somebody have a heart attack?"
Never in your wildest dreams,

05:20.360 --> 05:23.560
would you think of anything--
You wouldn't know what to think.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.000
My first thought, of course,
was my dad had a heart attack.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.840
He's a little older than Kathleen.

05:27.920 --> 05:31.200
So when I ran in there,
and I saw my dad alive,

05:31.280 --> 05:33.880
I was, quite honestly, a little relieved,
thinking, "Oh, phew."

05:34.840 --> 05:37.880
And then he was able to mutter the word,

05:38.760 --> 05:40.320
something along the lines of,

05:40.440 --> 05:43.560
"Kathleen, Kathleen!
Oh, my God, this-- this--

05:44.200 --> 05:45.800
Oh, God, Kathleen."

05:45.880 --> 05:49.960
And he was motioning
in the direction of the staircase.

05:50.400 --> 05:55.080
Sir, somebody else
is dispatching the ambulance.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.560
-
- Okay, is she awake now?

05:58.640 --> 05:59.560
Hello?

06:02.040 --> 06:02.880
Hello?

06:11.160 --> 06:12.280
Oh, God.

06:24.320 --> 06:27.200
I can vividly remember finding Kathleen,

06:27.280 --> 06:31.480
I can remember opening the door.
I can remember calling 9-1-1.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.400
I can remember...
I particularly remember

06:36.760 --> 06:37.680
Todd just...

06:39.320 --> 06:42.400
holding me as tight as possible,
I think to contain me,

06:42.800 --> 06:45.280
and I can remember Heather,

06:45.600 --> 06:48.640
the doctor, Ben's girlfriend,

06:48.760 --> 06:50.360
taking my pulse.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.000
And then I can remember,
and it must have been very early,

06:54.080 --> 06:55.760
while I was still in the kitchen,

06:55.840 --> 06:59.120
that a cop was on me instantly,
everywhere I went,

06:59.200 --> 07:00.760
a policeman was there.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.240
I went outside with Ben,

07:05.800 --> 07:09.440
and a policeman was there,
and I remember walking down there,

07:09.520 --> 07:13.800
and a policeman was there.
There was always a policeman with me.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.320
I knew for a fact that

07:15.840 --> 07:18.960
no way in this world my father
ever would have hurt Kathleen.

07:19.840 --> 07:20.840
But...

07:22.040 --> 07:26.080
the realism of their investigating it
did seem real.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.080
While it was completely unfounded
in my mind,

07:30.720 --> 07:32.160
the way that they were behaving,

07:32.520 --> 07:34.720
the way that they were barking
orders at us,

07:35.240 --> 07:37.360
restricting us from talking
to one another,

07:38.040 --> 07:42.400
they truly drove home the point that they
were investigating this as a crime.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.960
We came up Sycamore,

07:46.320 --> 07:49.040
and you come up,
and it kind of dead ends into our house,

07:49.120 --> 07:51.360
and you just see the yellow tape
across the whole house,

07:51.440 --> 07:54.160
and it was horrible.
It's like, our house.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.240
You want to go home,
the yellow tape is right there,

07:56.320 --> 07:57.920
and you can't go home and...

07:59.120 --> 08:02.080
It was the worst thing
in the world and then, um...

08:04.400 --> 08:06.800
I remember Dad
actually explaining it to us,

08:06.880 --> 08:09.440
and he was just like,
he was in shock, kind of,

08:09.520 --> 08:12.680
and he was kind of shaking,
and he was like, "I didn't do it."

08:12.840 --> 08:14.200
You know, "You have to believe me."

08:14.280 --> 08:16.800
We're like,
"Dad, we believe you," you know?

08:16.880 --> 08:20.120
"This is horrible, like, how can we not
believe you," you know? It's...

08:20.520 --> 08:22.320
We didn't even know any details yet

08:22.400 --> 08:25.320
and we were just like, "We believe you.
We know it's not true,

08:25.400 --> 08:29.600
and this is horrible,"
and it was just so upsetting.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.960
I couldn't believe it, but it was
so hard to think about that,

08:34.039 --> 08:35.400
because at the same time,

08:35.480 --> 08:37.679
we were thinking about
our mother, you know? And...

08:38.919 --> 08:42.440
it was... It was like two bombshells,
I guess, hitting us.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.280
When I first entered the house,

08:58.120 --> 08:59.400
I noticed...

09:00.880 --> 09:02.600
what appeared to be two legs,

09:02.680 --> 09:08.240
just kinda sticking out of a doorway
or hallway to my left,

09:08.320 --> 09:13.600
and once I approached the victim,

09:14.360 --> 09:15.800
there was just a...

09:16.760 --> 09:17.600
very...

09:18.760 --> 09:21.680
abundant amount of blood

09:22.440 --> 09:26.000
on her, on the floor, on the walls,

09:26.720 --> 09:28.040
that just was not...

09:30.360 --> 09:33.000
consistent with somebody
falling down the steps.

09:45.440 --> 09:48.920
Well, obviously we can't know
exactly what happened.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.080
We have to piece together
what we believe happened,

09:52.160 --> 09:55.040
based on the circumstantial evidence
that we've uncovered.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.680
The only people that know are
Mike Peterson and Kathleen Peterson,

09:58.760 --> 10:04.800
and obviously, Mr. Peterson's not going to
enlighten us about what he knows.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.880
We believe the evidence,
at least our evidence, is gonna show

10:08.960 --> 10:13.040
that she was beaten,
that she was stunned,

10:13.120 --> 10:14.440
and was bleeding,

10:15.240 --> 10:17.280
that she probably recovered,

10:17.920 --> 10:19.720
and had-- And struggled,

10:20.920 --> 10:24.520
in the door frame
with Mike Peterson to a degree,

10:24.600 --> 10:28.280
and that he then had to bludgeon her...

10:29.120 --> 10:33.440
on multiple occasions after that,
and that she basically bled to death.

10:33.800 --> 10:39.880
Live, local, up to the minute.
This is ABC 11 Eyewitness News at six.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.960
Michael Peterson's supporters
can't believe he's charged

10:44.040 --> 10:46.160
with the murder of his wife, Kathleen.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.280
Kathleen was my life.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.680
I whispered her name
in my heart 1,000 times.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.400
She is there,

10:55.280 --> 10:56.400
but I can't stop crying.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.720
But a special grand jury
decided today

10:58.800 --> 11:00.800
there was sufficient evidence
gathered by police

11:00.880 --> 11:03.040
to warrant a trial in this case.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.760
- First-degree murder.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.320
Now, 11 days after
frantically calling 9-1-1,

11:08.400 --> 11:10.040
seeking help for his wife,

11:10.320 --> 11:13.880
Michael Peterson must spend the night
inside the Durham County Jail.

11:14.640 --> 11:18.400
My mother and Mike had
an absolutely loving relationship,

11:18.480 --> 11:20.400
and there is no way that either of them

11:20.480 --> 11:22.960
would ever wish any sort of harm
on the other one.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.440
Kathleen Peterson's
biological daughter, Caitlin Atwater,

11:26.520 --> 11:29.600
served as the main spokesperson
for the Peterson family.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.320
She stood shoulder-to-shoulder
with Peterson's biological sons

11:32.400 --> 11:35.880
and their sisters, adopted
by Kathleen and Mike Peterson.

11:35.960 --> 11:40.680
This is going to be the most
unbelievably heartbreaking Christmas

11:40.960 --> 11:42.320
we could ever imagine.

11:42.440 --> 11:47.080
We've already lost one mother,
now the state has taken away our father.

11:47.160 --> 11:48.680
In my mind, you know,

11:48.760 --> 11:51.920
if Mike finds Kathleen
at the bottom of the stairs,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.880
it's a reasonable assumption on his part
that she fell down the stairs.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.640
Peterson's attorney, David Rudolph,

11:57.720 --> 12:01.120
says the authorities seemed to haveÂ jumped
to conclusions about Kathleen's death.

12:01.200 --> 12:05.400
For us, if in fact the police are right,
that this was not a fall,

12:05.640 --> 12:08.040
that should be the beginning
of the investigation,

12:08.120 --> 12:09.760
not the end of the investigation.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.120
So far...

12:21.640 --> 12:24.880
you know, what I've been saying
to the Press, basically, is...

12:26.120 --> 12:27.680
we think it's an accident,

12:28.120 --> 12:30.840
but until our experts look at it,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.480
we really can't say
whether it's an accident or an intruder.

12:34.560 --> 12:37.600
What we know for sure is it has
nothing to do with Michael.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.440
The benefits of the Intruder theory
is it's simpler.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.400
There's no debate over the forensics,
for the most part.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.760
The real problem with the Intruder theory
is lack of evidence that there was one.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.960
The intruder would then have to have
a weapon with them,

12:50.120 --> 12:53.200
capable inflicting these wounds,
but not a knife or a gun...

12:53.680 --> 12:55.440
- and take that weapon with them.
- Right.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.920
Mike clearly came
and reacted to the scene.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.080
- Right.
- What we don't really seem to have

13:00.160 --> 13:02.880
is shoe prints leaving the scene

13:03.480 --> 13:05.800
that an intruder clearly wanted to get
the hell out of there

13:05.880 --> 13:11.200
It seems to me what the intruder versus
accident theory really boils down to is...

13:12.640 --> 13:15.120
what caused the lacerations on the head?

13:15.840 --> 13:17.360
I agree.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.320
I mean, injuries itself, to me,

13:19.440 --> 13:22.920
they're just not a rage type injuries
in comparison to--

13:23.000 --> 13:25.680
With a rage, you'd have skull fractures.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.360
You'd have not only that.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.400
You'd have a lot of major lacerations
in her face.

13:31.480 --> 13:34.600
You know, I've never met anybody
that just stood still

13:34.840 --> 13:38.840
and waited to be hit on the head
four times or seven times.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.240
She'd have to stand still
and let the back of her head

13:41.320 --> 13:43.200
get beaten by an intruder without
moving around.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.120
It would be bizarre.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.240
Everything that I've heard about Kathleen
and learned about her

13:47.320 --> 13:49.240
is she is a very feisty woman,

13:49.360 --> 13:51.920
and there's no way that she's going
to allow anybody...

13:52.520 --> 13:55.800
to beat her up without fighting back,

13:56.200 --> 14:00.320
and there are no signs whatsoever
that she fought back.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.760
I just don't see a crime of rage.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.400
In all the experience I have,
it's just not there.

14:28.840 --> 14:29.680
Hey.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.280
- Ron Guerette.
- David Perlmutt.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.280
- How are you doing? Good to see you.
- Come on in.

14:34.360 --> 14:35.560
All right, thank you.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.440
You have breakfast already?

14:41.520 --> 14:43.560
Would you like some bagels
or orange juice?

14:43.640 --> 14:45.080
No. Where's the coffee?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.520
- You didn't make any?
- Coffee's not made.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.120
Oh, well, that's all right.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.520
Is this the book here?

14:50.680 --> 14:53.720
Yeah, that's the book
that Mike and I co-wrote.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.600
Charlie Two Shoes
and the Marines of Love Company.

14:57.720 --> 14:58.680
Yep.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.680
- Came out in the late 1998.
- Ninety-eight?

15:06.200 --> 15:09.920
My understanding is the last time
that you spoke with Kathleen

15:10.000 --> 15:12.520
was a couple days before her death.
Tell me about that.

15:12.600 --> 15:15.040
It was really the night before.
Essentially, the night before.

15:15.120 --> 15:18.400
It was on the seventh
of December, a Friday.

15:18.480 --> 15:22.640
Friday evening,
I had spoken with Stratton Leopold,

15:22.720 --> 15:25.720
who is a producer in Hollywood,

15:25.800 --> 15:29.880
and he-- We had been
talking to him for about a year

15:30.720 --> 15:35.760
about the possibility of him optioning
this book for a movie,

15:36.440 --> 15:39.480
and he calls me that day, that afternoon,

15:39.720 --> 15:42.760
and said that it was a done deal,
everything was official,

15:43.240 --> 15:46.640
and so I called Mike just after that.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.680
It was probably
about six o'clock that evening,

15:49.760 --> 15:51.240
and Kathleen answered the phone,

15:51.320 --> 15:54.240
and we spent maybe ten minutes
talking on the phone.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.920
Now, that night, you spoke to her
about ten minutes.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.560
Did you talk to Mike too that evening?

15:58.640 --> 16:01.480
Yeah, she must have been talking
in the kitchen,

16:02.160 --> 16:03.320
uh...

16:04.040 --> 16:08.400
because I said,
"Well, is the old man there?" Mike was--

16:08.640 --> 16:12.280
Kathleen and I are the same age,
and Mike was about ten years older,

16:13.040 --> 16:15.480
and she said, "Yeah, the old man is here,

16:15.560 --> 16:20.920
but he's going to have to empty the dryer
and mop the kitchen floor

16:21.000 --> 16:22.600
before he comes to talk."

16:22.680 --> 16:25.400
They always had a very playful way
with each other,

16:25.480 --> 16:28.480
and I could hear him chuckling
in the background.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.680
Did you hear any...

16:32.520 --> 16:36.080
I mean, did there appear to be
any pressure between each other?

16:36.320 --> 16:40.360
Frustration, anything like that,
between Mike and Kathleen on this night?

16:40.440 --> 16:42.080
They were absolutely normal.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.800
They were...

16:43.920 --> 16:48.800
They were like I always saw them
or heard them.

16:50.440 --> 16:53.120
As I said, they were playful.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.000
I heard...

16:55.320 --> 16:59.280
I sensed no stress
or tension between them.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.160
Just absolutely normal.

17:01.720 --> 17:05.119
And that's why it's such
a stretch to think

17:05.440 --> 17:08.359
that they went from this normal,

17:08.440 --> 17:13.520
playful, back and forth
between each other to...

17:14.520 --> 17:16.440
something that is homicidal.

17:16.560 --> 17:21.480
It just makes absolutely no sense to me.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.680
It's inconceivable.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.320
More autopsy photographs here.

17:39.640 --> 17:40.560
That...

17:42.040 --> 17:45.960
And it's impossible for me to believe,
if that's the back of her head,

17:46.880 --> 17:48.720
that that could be caused from...

17:49.600 --> 17:50.560
a series of...

17:51.960 --> 17:53.240
missteps...

17:53.400 --> 17:56.040
or fall down 15 flights--

17:56.120 --> 17:57.960
I mean, 15 different stairs.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.920
I just... I can't see that happening.

18:00.760 --> 18:01.640
This is--

18:01.720 --> 18:03.240
Nor could the medical examiner.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.680
And that's...

18:07.520 --> 18:09.480
from my perspective, an impossibility.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.560
As Mike indicates,

18:12.640 --> 18:15.320
the medical examiner doesn't believe
that it was possible, either.

18:15.400 --> 18:20.840
That this had to occur fromÂ multiple
inflictions of blunt-force trauma.

18:23.440 --> 18:25.200
And all that
with no skull fractures.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.880
If they have a witness who can say
that she went down the stairs

18:27.960 --> 18:29.320
like a pogo stick, head-first...

18:29.400 --> 18:30.880
GREG MEAD
ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY

18:30.960 --> 18:32.680
...bouncing along, that might fit,

18:32.760 --> 18:35.320
but somehow, I don't think that's
the way people fall down stairs.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.320
From my experience as an investigator
and law enforcement officer,

18:38.400 --> 18:41.200
it was just not consistent
with a fall down a flight of steps,

18:42.840 --> 18:45.080
and that's why I moved out

18:45.160 --> 18:49.800
and went to obtain an application
for a search warrant so quick.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.040
You can't look at that
and think that it's an accident.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.560
And especially when you couple it
with the fact that the first...

18:57.640 --> 18:59.520
I guess you've heard the 9-1-1 tape,

18:59.600 --> 19:04.000
but the first call in,
she's supposedly still breathing.

19:04.640 --> 19:09.160
Second call in, 15 minutes later or so,
she's just quit breathing.

19:09.240 --> 19:13.440
And yet, when the medical examiners
or the EMTs arrived,

19:13.520 --> 19:17.160
the blood was so dry,
that they didn't even get any on them.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.000
They didn't have to wear
protective garments,

19:20.080 --> 19:23.760
because the blood was already dry.
She'd been there for hours, probably.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.600
It just never occurred to Michael Peterson

19:27.680 --> 19:30.640
that people wouldn't believe him
when he said she fell down the stairs.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.720
That's really what this is all about.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.360
He thought he'd get away with it.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.880
Live, local,
up to the minute.

19:39.080 --> 19:42.280
This is ABC 11 Eyewitness News at six.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.760
Sir, quit being smart
and answer the dadgum question.

19:45.840 --> 19:48.560
In an occasionally tense
bond hearing today,

19:48.640 --> 19:52.840
Mike Peterson's son Todd verbally scuffled
with the judge and District Attorney.

19:53.280 --> 19:57.440
With shackled ankles and often
with tears streaming down his face,

19:57.560 --> 20:01.680
Mike Peterson sat by, emotionally
listening to character witnesses

20:01.760 --> 20:06.120
before the judge agreed
to let him go on $850,000 bond.

20:06.200 --> 20:09.480
Peterson left the Durham County Jail
just after 6:00 p.m.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.280
I really want to go home.
I wanna see my kids,

20:12.600 --> 20:16.280
and this is the first opportunity
I've had now, to grieve for my wife,

20:16.360 --> 20:18.840
and I really would like to have that time.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.640
While his lawyers now turn
to the facts of the case,

20:21.760 --> 20:23.960
Peterson turns to his remaining family,

20:24.040 --> 20:27.480
glancing at his first glimpse
of sky outside the jail,

20:27.560 --> 20:30.080
chased by cameras. Even back at home,

20:30.200 --> 20:34.000
where friends arrived with groceries,
Mike Peterson won't have time alone.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.320
It always seemed to me

20:42.840 --> 20:46.080
that the greatest threat to our freedoms

20:46.160 --> 20:49.840
came not from people
who committed crimes,

20:50.840 --> 20:51.800
but from...

20:53.440 --> 20:57.000
the way the government
tends to respond to that,

20:57.640 --> 21:03.200
and the way the government tends
to take on power for itself

21:04.440 --> 21:07.760
almost as though there's a vacuum
that someone has to fill,

21:07.840 --> 21:09.560
and the government's going to fill it.

21:10.120 --> 21:12.000
And so, for me,

21:12.440 --> 21:14.720
being in the role
of a criminal defense lawyer

21:15.720 --> 21:20.600
is being in the role of a person
who can do at least a little bit

21:21.320 --> 21:23.960
to hold back
some of the government excesses,

21:24.040 --> 21:29.520
to make sure
that we don't lose our freedoms,

21:29.840 --> 21:31.520
in an effort to protect them.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.040
In Michael's case,

21:42.120 --> 21:46.680
there is no doubt in my mind
that he is not guilty of this,

21:46.800 --> 21:51.640
and so for me, being able
to help him establish his innocence

21:51.720 --> 21:54.920
is really what is moving me at this point.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.360
Let me ask a question.

22:26.480 --> 22:29.960
In the experience that you've seen,
whether somebody was hit with something

22:30.040 --> 22:34.360
versus falling on a blunt-type,
in a blunt-type contact,

22:34.440 --> 22:36.000
are these very consistent,

22:36.840 --> 22:38.800
or are there aberrations here?

22:38.880 --> 22:43.880
I would tend to consider the lacerations

22:44.160 --> 22:49.640
as second choice in my thought
of what occurred here.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.520
The first choice is
the presence of the bruises,

22:53.600 --> 22:55.160
not the presence of the lacerations.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.280
The presence of the lacerations
is misleading.

22:59.120 --> 23:02.600
Because you see a whole lot of lacerations
and you say, "Oh, my God!"

23:02.880 --> 23:05.120
I did that too at the beginning.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.360
I looked at that, and I think,
"Oh, my God, that is terrible!"

23:09.320 --> 23:11.680
This is boom, boom, boom,
hit them on the head.

23:11.760 --> 23:12.680
Right.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.960
But when you keep looking at it,
then you see things you didn't see before.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.920
That's why I keep telling people,
you know,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.920
you should never look at a picture
just one time.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.560
You look at it on Monday,
and then on Tuesday,

23:23.640 --> 23:26.120
and then on Friday and then on Monday.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.000
And every time you look at it,
you see new stuff.

23:29.080 --> 23:29.920
Yeah.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.320
And so...

23:33.120 --> 23:37.440
When, at the beginning,
I thought this was an elongated object,

23:37.760 --> 23:39.600
I think I've changed my mind on that.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.120
That's reasonably consistent
with a flat object,

23:43.200 --> 23:46.000
meaning hitting the ground,
because the curvature--

23:46.120 --> 23:47.920
Round, flat object.

23:48.040 --> 23:53.440
This wound here had to have been
at least two impacts.

23:56.040 --> 23:59.880
This one here had to have been
at least one impact.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.440
This area here
and this area here are split.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.760
- Mm-hm.
- They did not make any contact at all.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.360
- And the impact occurred here.
- Mm-hm.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.520
And then it's like
when you take a watermelon

24:12.600 --> 24:15.280
and you throw it on the ground,
you get tears in places

24:15.360 --> 24:17.200
where it never touched the ground.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.480
So we've got one impact here,

24:19.600 --> 24:22.640
you've got one impact maybe here,
and you've got one here.

24:22.760 --> 24:26.320
When you say several impacts,
are you talking about several times,

24:26.400 --> 24:28.280
or could it be one point of contact?

24:28.360 --> 24:29.880
Single contact at the same time.

24:29.960 --> 24:30.800
Single, yeah.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.000
Single occurrence,
three points of contact.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.160
Right.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.360
You take the watermelon
and you throw it on the ground,

24:36.440 --> 24:38.320
and it's gonna be in a million pieces.

24:43.720 --> 24:44.800
Okay, Werner here.

24:46.120 --> 24:49.000
Faris, why don't you go in there?
You need to be up close.

24:51.240 --> 24:54.160
That's the place that we found the body.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.680
What we didn't notice is in
the moulding area,

24:57.960 --> 25:00.000
you see the contact.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.440
Faris, can you see that? And dripping.

25:03.760 --> 25:08.280
That which is indicative
of a liquid source of blood coming down.

25:08.640 --> 25:13.680
More so, we see some spatter
in this corner here,

25:13.840 --> 25:15.920
which means active bleeding still.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.760
The most interesting thing, we found
hair tissue material on this moulding.

25:21.840 --> 25:25.240
See some damage on the moulding.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.120
Yeah, there's some fiber there.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.480
I checked all the ceiling area.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.680
No cast-off pattern.

25:35.200 --> 25:39.000
Generally, if somebody beat up somebody,
we see a cast-off pattern.

25:39.080 --> 25:39.960
Sure.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.480
And here, it's not.

25:42.760 --> 25:47.040
So, however, if this weapon
is too confined in place,

25:47.920 --> 25:49.280
very small place...

25:49.520 --> 25:51.000
It would be very hard to...

25:51.080 --> 25:53.520
It would be hard
to have that energy level.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.520
Yeah.

25:57.400 --> 26:03.000
How do you get your spatter coming up
this wall here kind of behind this...

26:03.440 --> 26:07.600
Okay, here, it could be a possibility
of somebody coughing.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.640
- Ah.
-

26:10.200 --> 26:12.040
So you're going to have a--

26:12.120 --> 26:14.680
It's not inhaling, it's exhaling.

26:14.760 --> 26:18.480
But if she's coughing up
pure blood, like here,

26:18.560 --> 26:23.920
wouldn't she have either a fracture
of the base of the skull or an injury--

26:24.000 --> 26:30.680
Maybe the blood comes from hair, face,
comes onto nose or mouth.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.200
So it's all external?

26:32.280 --> 26:35.280
Just the wet head sponge thing.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.720
It's not from internal bleeding.

26:37.840 --> 26:41.400
- It's externalÂ getting into the system.
- I understand.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.920
What about--
I mean, it could be anything there.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.400
- It was in this position.
- Not much higher.

27:05.040 --> 27:05.960
Okay.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.760
The autopsy photos are
items one, two, three, four, five, six,

27:26.840 --> 27:31.280
seven, eight, nine, ten,
in terms of importance to the state.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.080
And they're going to hit that really hard.

27:34.160 --> 27:39.320
The power of those photos is,
you know, they're visceral.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.320
I mean, you look at them, and you know,

27:41.400 --> 27:45.040
you don't need expert testimony to say,
"Oh, she must have been beaten."

27:45.120 --> 27:46.880
That's the thought that pops in your head.

27:47.560 --> 27:50.840
Without explanation,
it's hard to imagine,

27:51.000 --> 27:54.280
how does somebody fall down the steps
and end up with these kind of blows?

27:55.040 --> 27:58.600
And you know,
I think that really needs to be addressed

27:58.840 --> 28:01.680
in terms of you know finding out,
you know, what...

28:02.640 --> 28:05.600
how do people, what do people
just think on their own?

28:05.680 --> 28:09.520
Then putting out
the defense explanation of it.

28:09.600 --> 28:15.320
Our experts are of the view
that she probably fell

28:15.720 --> 28:19.160
and knocked herself out in a first fall.

28:20.600 --> 28:24.480
And with lots of bleeding
coming from the head.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.640
Where do they say she fell?

28:27.840 --> 28:30.840
Probably on the second or third step
going up.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.800
You can see it here.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.240
This is where the stair turns,

28:36.320 --> 28:38.400
and you can see
how narrow the steps are here.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.240
Plus, you're going from the light,

28:41.000 --> 28:44.320
a lighted hallway or a lighted kitchen,
and this is very dark.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.520
There's no lighting immediately over this.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.800
There's only a light
at the top of the stairs.

28:50.320 --> 28:53.240
She had a .07 blood alcohol.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.240
She's going from light to dark,

28:56.920 --> 28:58.960
and you've got these stairs.

28:59.040 --> 29:02.400
So Henry thinks she tripped
on one of these stairs here,

29:03.040 --> 29:04.960
- and hit her head,
- Fell backwards?

29:05.120 --> 29:06.960
fell backwards, and hit her head...

29:08.120 --> 29:11.080
probably somewhere up here,

29:11.440 --> 29:14.680
and then there's a little bit of blood
that looks like sort of...

29:14.840 --> 29:17.440
her head slid down or something,

29:17.520 --> 29:19.480
and then hit her head again.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.120
She fell backwards,
hit her head against the doorframe...

29:22.240 --> 29:23.880
Right, and then fell on the floor.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.960
- Fell on the floor and hit her head again.
- Right.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.520
- So you got two hits.
- That's what he thinks happened?

29:28.640 --> 29:33.040
Yeah, and she's unconscious then,
bleeding on the floor

29:33.240 --> 29:35.160
for some period of time,

29:35.240 --> 29:39.120
and then she comes to
after some period of time,

29:39.560 --> 29:43.080
and tries to get up and there's blood
on the bottom of her feet.

29:43.160 --> 29:46.240
And you know, in order for there
to be blood on the bottom of her feet,

29:46.320 --> 29:48.640
there needs to be a fair amount
of blood on the floor

29:48.720 --> 29:50.640
because it's not just
a speck or two, it's--

29:50.720 --> 29:53.480
- Right, it's completely coated?
- Right.

29:54.800 --> 29:57.080
And that she then fell again.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.920
You know, obviously,
if you're trying to get up in blood,

30:00.000 --> 30:01.760
it's incredibly slippery.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.520
And fell again.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.440
Fell right there?

30:15.520 --> 30:16.480
Right there.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.360
Right.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.080
Um...

30:24.640 --> 30:28.240
Dave, we need to stop
doing this in front of him. This is...

30:28.800 --> 30:31.920
If today's his birthday, it's not
the best day in the world to do it.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.760
We really need to keep him out of this.

30:33.840 --> 30:34.840
Okay. That's fine.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.840
When I think of Kathleen,

30:46.440 --> 30:47.720
what I remember,

30:48.320 --> 30:51.480
unfortunately, is her dying in my arms.

30:54.320 --> 30:58.680
That's always the overwhelming image.

30:58.760 --> 31:01.760
If I look at something, I think, "Yeah,
God, there was this funny thing,"

31:01.840 --> 31:06.880
or a picture on the refrigerator where
she is in the Imperial Gardens in Tokyo

31:06.960 --> 31:11.480
or there's so many things that always,
if I stop and think,

31:11.760 --> 31:14.400
not one thing comes up.
Never one thing.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.600
Or I might think,
"Oh, that's a shining moment,"

31:16.680 --> 31:18.680
and then I'll see a picture
of something else

31:18.760 --> 31:21.880
or another incident might occur,
and I'll be like, "There's that one,"

31:22.040 --> 31:26.280
so there's not one
identifying thing with Kathleen, no.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.520
Um...

32:28.000 --> 32:31.160
The first people we have
is Michael Peterson,

32:32.720 --> 32:33.600
and...

32:35.080 --> 32:35.960
Patty.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.400
What year did they...

32:39.520 --> 32:42.880
- What year were they married?
- They were married in 1966.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.280
Do you know
if they got married in the States?

32:46.320 --> 32:49.680
I think they're married in the States,
because after they were married,

32:50.640 --> 32:52.200
Mike went to Vietnam,

32:52.520 --> 32:55.080
Patty went to Germany,
she was a teacher in Germany.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.440
So after Mike got out of Vietnam,

32:58.520 --> 33:01.800
then he went to Germany.
While they were in Germany,

33:02.040 --> 33:04.480
they had two sons, the oldest is Clayton.

33:06.040 --> 33:08.200
And the next child was Todd.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.320
So they had two boys of their marriage.

33:14.720 --> 33:17.480
And both of the boys were born in Germany?

33:17.640 --> 33:21.080
Both boys born in Germany,
and Clayton is the oldest one.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.120
Okay.

33:23.080 --> 33:26.200
Mike was a retired Marine captain,

33:27.080 --> 33:31.680
and when he got to Germany,
one of his better friends...

33:32.640 --> 33:35.760
was George Ratliff,
who was a captain in the Air Force.

33:36.720 --> 33:37.880
And George--

33:38.440 --> 33:42.480
Correction, Elizabeth worked
with Patty at the college.

33:42.560 --> 33:44.720
They both taught at the same college,

33:44.800 --> 33:48.520
and that's how Patty and Elizabeth
got together as good friends,

33:48.640 --> 33:51.600
and then Mike and George,
both being captains,

33:51.800 --> 33:52.800
became good friends.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.160
After...

33:56.520 --> 33:59.600
George and Liz were married,
they had two children.

33:59.920 --> 34:02.600
Margaret is the oldest daughter,

34:02.880 --> 34:04.880
and Martha the youngest.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.280
Shortly after the birth of Martha,

34:09.840 --> 34:14.080
George died in 1983
in an invasion in Grenada.

34:15.520 --> 34:18.800
Two years after George died,

34:20.159 --> 34:24.440
Liz dies in 1985 while living in Germany.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.080
At this time the entire Peterson family

34:27.159 --> 34:29.600
and the Ratliff family
are living in Germany.

34:29.920 --> 34:33.760
During this period of time,
after George and Liz die,

34:33.840 --> 34:38.679
After Liz dies,
Martha and Margaret move in

34:38.760 --> 34:41.639
with Mike and Patty, Todd and Clayton,

34:41.960 --> 34:45.840
because George and Elizabeth
in their wills, separate wills,

34:45.920 --> 34:50.360
wanted Mike and Patty
to be the caretakers of their children.

34:55.239 --> 34:57.760
Mike and Patty started having problems,

34:58.320 --> 35:01.360
and Mike came back
to United States, in--

35:01.440 --> 35:04.080
What year was it that he started--
That he met Kathleen?

35:04.160 --> 35:07.880
- He met Kathleen in 1986.
- So he met her in 1986.

35:07.960 --> 35:11.000
Kathleen had a daughter named Caitlin.

35:13.120 --> 35:17.160
What year did--
When did they move in together?

35:17.280 --> 35:18.560
That was in 1989.

35:18.640 --> 35:24.240
And that's when Martha
and Margaret became...

35:25.520 --> 35:29.000
one family under the same roof with Mike.

35:30.320 --> 35:34.280
So Mike and Kathleen living together,
and they had the three girls,

35:34.920 --> 35:36.760
and there was moving back and forth,

35:36.840 --> 35:42.880
and eventually,
Todd and Clayton moved in

35:43.840 --> 35:48.440
with Mike and Kathleen
in Durham, North Carolina.

35:49.000 --> 35:52.800
So how old were each one of the kids
at the time of Kathleen's death in 2001?

35:52.960 --> 35:54.960
Her daughter, Caitlin, was 19.

35:57.040 --> 35:59.360
Margaret, the oldest, was 20.

35:59.920 --> 36:03.120
The baby, Martha, was 18.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.960
Clayton was 27,

36:08.040 --> 36:09.880
and Todd was 25,

36:11.720 --> 36:12.720
when Kathleen died.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.800
- And that was in the year 2001?
- 2001.

37:00.640 --> 37:03.360
After your mother died,
your real mother died...

37:04.800 --> 37:06.920
- who took care of you?
- Um...

37:07.040 --> 37:12.000
My dad right now, Michael Peterson
and his wife, Patty.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.200
Your dad died
before your mother did, right?

37:14.280 --> 37:15.160
Yes.

37:16.520 --> 37:20.080
And you were probably still a baby
in your mother's womb,

37:20.160 --> 37:22.200
weren't you not, at that time?
Or were you born?

37:22.280 --> 37:24.080
No, I was about six months old.

37:24.160 --> 37:25.480
Six months old?

37:25.840 --> 37:28.200
How old were you and your mom died?

37:28.560 --> 37:31.960
I was... 18.

37:32.040 --> 37:32.960
Eighteen?

37:33.680 --> 37:34.720
Months?

37:35.040 --> 37:36.880
Oh, my birth mom. I'm sorry.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.360
Your birth mom. I'm sorry.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.360
I think I was...

37:42.640 --> 37:44.720
- a little over a year.
- Okay.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.080
So you have very little memory.

37:47.200 --> 37:50.800
Yeah, the only memory I have
is what people have told me.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.400
- So I don't have memories.
- Okay, and...

37:54.320 --> 37:58.280
How did you start referring to Kathleen
when you moved in the house with her?

37:58.520 --> 38:00.640
Well, we called her Kathleen
for a good while,

38:00.800 --> 38:01.640
and...

38:02.840 --> 38:05.400
I started calling her mom when...

38:06.720 --> 38:09.520
I would say it was about, I was in...

38:10.840 --> 38:13.360
a freshman in high school.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.320
So about five years ago.

38:16.840 --> 38:18.320
And that's when I started to,

38:18.400 --> 38:21.280
because I realized
how much she was doing for us.

38:21.360 --> 38:25.880
Tell me about the relationship
between Mike and Kathleen.

38:26.800 --> 38:30.840
I mean, refer to them as Mom and Dad.
I don't want to discourage you in that,

38:30.920 --> 38:33.160
now that we know
who you're talking about, you know?

38:33.520 --> 38:36.520
Just tell me about the relationship
between your mom and dad.

38:37.320 --> 38:38.240
Well, it was...

38:39.640 --> 38:42.600
It was wonderful. I mean, they were...

38:43.320 --> 38:44.760
so happy that last year.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.880
They were just, I don't know, there was...

38:48.520 --> 38:50.480
It was beautiful.
They were just really happy.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.200
They loved each other. They...

38:54.320 --> 38:56.480
didn't ever fight usually, and...

38:56.640 --> 38:58.760
they just took so much joy
in other's presence.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.360
I mean, we would laugh all the time.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.480
They would just come home
and make dinner,

39:04.560 --> 39:06.480
and you know,
drink some wine or something,

39:06.560 --> 39:08.000
and it was just beautiful

39:08.080 --> 39:11.200
because we would just end up
laughing the whole night,

39:11.280 --> 39:13.400
and I would just talk to mom forever.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.200
I don't know, it was really beautiful.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.880
I never saw any problems.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.680
Now, you say "usually."

39:19.280 --> 39:21.640
- Did I?
- At one point, you did.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.480
Did you ever see any...

39:26.440 --> 39:28.840
any problems between the two of them?

39:29.440 --> 39:31.800
Any... were there ever any discussions?

39:32.840 --> 39:36.640
No, the only problems were,
Mom would get frustrated at Dad

39:36.720 --> 39:38.800
for not coming home
from the gym on time,

39:38.880 --> 39:42.840
and that was just because of dinner,
but that always ended with everybody...

39:43.160 --> 39:45.040
Just, I mean that was the only problem,

39:45.120 --> 39:48.320
but it was really such a small problem
that it was almost a joke.

39:48.400 --> 39:50.960
Do you think
if there would have been any problems

39:51.040 --> 39:54.280
between her and your dad,
that she would have...

39:54.840 --> 39:57.240
maybe not necessarily
told you the problems,

39:57.320 --> 39:58.680
but she would've let you know

39:58.760 --> 40:01.600
that Mike was doing something
she doesn't appreciate?

40:02.040 --> 40:04.880
Yeah. She definitely would have.

40:04.960 --> 40:08.160
She was always straightforward with us.

40:08.240 --> 40:12.200
I mean, if there was ever, like,
a problem in the family,

40:12.320 --> 40:14.440
you know, between, like,
any of us, or between...

40:14.920 --> 40:16.680
like, Martha and Dad, you know,

40:16.760 --> 40:20.160
like, Dad hates Martha's haircut
or something, or her hair color.

40:20.240 --> 40:23.200
You know, I mean,
we had family dinner every night,

40:23.320 --> 40:26.480
so it was really hard not to bring that up
in conversation.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.440
I mean... no.

40:29.520 --> 40:32.320
Like, we were a very open family.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.960
I always felt like I could
talk about anything,

40:35.040 --> 40:39.360
and I know that Mom talked about
everything with us, too.

40:39.440 --> 40:43.600
How about the relationship
between Kathleen and your dad?

40:44.240 --> 40:46.080
It was always very strong. I was...

40:47.320 --> 40:49.360
kind of jealous of it and happy for him,

40:49.440 --> 40:53.720
because his relationship
with my mom had never been romantic

40:53.800 --> 40:56.520
or intimate or anything like that,
you know, very platonic.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.320
And to see him happy...

40:58.680 --> 41:00.760
with a woman, with Kathleen,

41:01.040 --> 41:03.160
the two of them were just
really good together.

41:03.240 --> 41:05.960
They just connected on a different plane.

41:08.040 --> 41:09.000
And...

41:11.520 --> 41:14.560
was there ever a time
where your dad would get really,

41:14.640 --> 41:18.120
really mad at you

41:18.200 --> 41:21.400
to where he showed his temper,
or anything like that?

41:21.520 --> 41:23.880
I mean that, to me, that'd have been
probably the worst time.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.680
That wasn't, actually.

41:25.800 --> 41:27.880
I mean, it might have been
for other things.

41:27.960 --> 41:30.040
Lord knows, I've done stupid things.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.920
Wrecked his car and things like that.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.120
Did he ever hit you?

41:33.280 --> 41:34.200
Yeah.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.960
- You know.
- Spank you or hit you?

41:36.040 --> 41:37.160
Um...

41:38.120 --> 41:39.440
I guess mostly spanking.

41:42.720 --> 41:45.240
You know, sometimes he'd crack
my brother's head together.

41:45.320 --> 41:47.320
I mean, this is when we were younger.

41:48.040 --> 41:49.040
I don't know.

41:49.360 --> 41:51.880
Not really crack your heads,
just bang your heads together?

41:51.960 --> 41:52.800
Yeah.

41:54.280 --> 41:55.880
Have you ever seen your dad...

41:57.200 --> 41:59.760
violent towards anybody?

42:00.920 --> 42:02.040
Uh...

42:02.200 --> 42:05.160
No, he disciplined us as children,
but that's...

42:05.760 --> 42:06.760
parental discipline.

42:06.840 --> 42:07.840
Has he ever hit you?

42:08.040 --> 42:10.480
He spanked us
when we were children, but...

42:12.440 --> 42:14.240
I don't have a friend who wasn't spanked.

42:14.320 --> 42:18.280
As far as actual
aggressive behavior, never.

42:19.240 --> 42:20.840
Never in his-- to another...

42:22.360 --> 42:27.600
I'll say, non-child of his,
meaning an adult, a partner...

42:28.520 --> 42:30.800
a wife... nothing, nothing.

42:31.440 --> 42:33.880
Even when he and my birth mother...

42:35.120 --> 42:37.680
would have disagreements, nothing.

42:37.760 --> 42:41.000
It was always my dad
to kind of chuckle and walk off.

42:41.120 --> 42:44.040
He never, ever became aggressive
in the slightest sense.

43:15.720 --> 43:16.720
Mike?

43:39.040 --> 43:40.120
Probably about here.

43:40.280 --> 43:42.040
- Around here?
- I'm guessing about here.

43:42.840 --> 43:44.960
This would be very close to where we were.

43:45.240 --> 43:46.160
Okay.

43:47.720 --> 43:49.720
Yeah, because she came over,
she smoked cigarettes,

43:49.800 --> 43:51.800
she threw the cigarettes out in there.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.440
- There may have been another chair here.
- That's alright. Okay.

43:54.520 --> 43:56.560
- But right about here.
- Okay, that's fine.

43:56.640 --> 43:59.280
- Alright, that's all I need. Okay.
- This is close enough.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.320
Tell Todd to hold off until we can get
the dogs out here, alright?

44:04.760 --> 44:06.320
Slow down, slow down.

44:07.280 --> 44:09.040
And you know to...

44:12.240 --> 44:13.640
forward this play button,

44:14.320 --> 44:17.800
and soon as you push it,
step back out of the way.

44:18.720 --> 44:21.200
- I can stand in the kitchen if you like.
- Okay.

44:21.800 --> 44:25.960
'Cause I want to have a human witness
in addition to the tape recording.

44:26.520 --> 44:29.200
- Make sure everything else is closed up.
- Okay.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.600
I can testify
that his doors are well-fitted.

44:45.560 --> 44:46.520
You ready?

44:51.640 --> 44:55.960
Hey! Help!
Somebody, help!

44:56.160 --> 44:58.520
Help!

44:59.000 --> 45:02.160
Somebody, anybody! Help me!

45:02.240 --> 45:05.200
Help me! Please help me!

45:05.400 --> 45:08.920
Help! Help!

45:23.320 --> 45:25.040
Help!

45:28.640 --> 45:32.560
[conversation inaudible
over sound of fountain]

45:42.120 --> 45:45.240
Help me! Help!

45:45.600 --> 45:47.600
Please, help me!

45:47.800 --> 45:49.000
Help!

45:49.720 --> 45:54.040
I need help! Anybody, help me!

45:54.600 --> 46:00.480
Help! Somebody, please! Help me!

46:01.560 --> 46:03.160
I need help!
