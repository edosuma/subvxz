00:08.109 --> 00:10.841
Douglas, have you seen Leo?
He's late for training.

00:10.841 --> 00:13.514
Why don't you just call him?
Too much work.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.517
Let's just kick him
out of the academy.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.120
( beeping )

00:19.120 --> 00:22.723
Hello.
 Leo, what are you doing
back in Mission Creek?

00:22.723 --> 00:24.725
You're supposed to
be here for training.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.728
Sorry, I had to pop back
 and deal with a little
 situation.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.730
Janelle missed me.

00:29.730 --> 00:33.033
You ladies
 can be so needy.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.866
She threatened to
break up with you,
didn't she?

00:35.866 --> 00:38.139
It was implied.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.540
( doorbell rings )

00:39.540 --> 00:40.711
Aaah! She's here!

00:43.214 --> 00:44.715
Can you believe him?

00:44.715 --> 00:47.017
Skipping his training
to hang out with a girl?

00:47.017 --> 00:50.050
You might understand it better
one day when you actually
have one.

00:52.022 --> 00:55.926
For your information,
later today I will be
online gaming

00:55.926 --> 00:57.658
with FrizzyBizzy21.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.892
And there's at least
a 50% chance

01:01.892 --> 01:04.095
that's a female!

01:05.096 --> 01:07.538
Yeah. No, there's not.

01:07.538 --> 01:10.601
( loud whooshing )

01:14.245 --> 01:16.447
Aaah! It's her!

01:16.447 --> 01:19.850
Hey, you look familiar.

01:19.850 --> 01:22.813
Do I know you
from somewhere?
CHASE: Adam,

01:22.813 --> 01:25.015
that's S-1.
Krane's lead soldier.

01:25.015 --> 01:26.957
She tried to destroy us.

01:26.957 --> 01:29.019
Oh, yeah.

01:29.019 --> 01:31.992
What do you say
we finish the job
and get out of here?

01:34.995 --> 01:37.998
The world's first
 bionic superhumans.

01:37.998 --> 01:42.773
They're stronger than us...
 faster...smarter.

01:42.773 --> 01:45.136
The next generation
 of the human race is...

01:45.136 --> 01:47.308
...living on a bionic island.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.584
♪♪

02:24.645 --> 02:26.046
What are you doing here?

02:26.046 --> 02:27.978
I figured since
this is the Bionic Academy

02:27.978 --> 02:30.321
you're the only people
who might be able to help.

02:30.321 --> 02:31.882
Something's wrong with me.

02:31.882 --> 02:35.686
Yeah, we already know that,
Psycho Sally.

02:35.686 --> 02:38.459
You tried to crush Leo
and take us all out.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.061
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.963
Of course she doesn't.

02:42.963 --> 02:46.567
She's a blank slate, just like
the rest of the soldiers were.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.270
Why weren't you rounded up
with everyone else?

02:49.270 --> 02:51.802
All I know is that I woke up
in a field

02:51.802 --> 02:53.844
and this family found me
and took me in.

02:53.844 --> 02:56.046
And when they discovered
I was bionic, they freaked out,

02:56.046 --> 02:58.409
so I ran away and I've been
hiding ever since.

02:58.409 --> 03:01.952
I don't believe her.
Why would she lie?

03:01.952 --> 03:04.755
Krane's no longer
controlling her mind
with the Triton App,

03:04.755 --> 03:06.517
so she has no reason
to be evil.

03:06.517 --> 03:09.620
Oh, yeah? That's what
we thought about Sebastian, too.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.662
And we all know
what happened there.

03:11.662 --> 03:14.495
We get it. He broke your heart.
Let it go.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.499
Look, if you don't believe me,
remove my chip.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.731
Then there's no way
I can hurt you.

03:25.376 --> 03:27.278
( device whirs, beeps )

03:27.278 --> 03:31.942
All clear. But you might want
to have that mole checked out.

03:31.942 --> 03:34.945
All right, now that we know
you're telling the truth,

03:34.945 --> 03:37.488
what exactly
is wrong with you?

03:37.488 --> 03:40.951
I keep having flashbacks
about a guy named Victor Krane.

03:40.951 --> 03:43.994
You're preachin'
to the choir, sister.

03:43.994 --> 03:47.127
Wait. When the Triton App
deactivated,

03:47.127 --> 03:48.859
it should have erased
all her memory.

03:48.859 --> 03:51.131
How can she still
remember Krane?

03:51.131 --> 03:54.064
It must be a glitch.
What else do you remember?

03:54.064 --> 03:56.467
He said that if anything bad
ever happened to him,

03:56.467 --> 03:58.839
something just as bad
would happen to me.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.210
I wouldn't worry about that.

04:00.210 --> 04:02.613
That was just the metal
in his face talkin'.

04:04.144 --> 04:06.176
Look, every time
I get a flashback

04:06.176 --> 04:07.648
I get a terrible headache.

04:07.648 --> 04:10.020
I'm really scared,
and I don't have

04:10.020 --> 04:12.182
anyone else to turn to.

04:12.182 --> 04:15.025
Please, help me figure out
what's going on.

04:16.587 --> 04:17.858
What do we do?

04:17.858 --> 04:19.829
I think we should help her.

04:19.829 --> 04:22.763
Okay, but when she crushes
your heart like Sebastian,

04:22.763 --> 04:24.194
don't come crying to me.

04:28.439 --> 04:30.601
All right,
almost done with the tests.

04:30.601 --> 04:32.643
How ya holding up?
Eh, pretty good.

04:32.643 --> 04:35.806
Probably gonna need a snack
around two.

04:35.806 --> 04:38.008
( beeping )

04:38.008 --> 04:39.880
Douglas, check this out.

04:42.012 --> 04:44.555
Huh. Looks like the Triton App

04:44.555 --> 04:47.358
left a virus hidden
in her bionic infrastructure.

04:47.358 --> 04:50.190
You mean like a virus
where I have a bowl
of chicken noodle soup

04:50.190 --> 04:51.992
and I'm all better?

04:51.992 --> 04:54.094
More like a virus
that'll cause you to explode

04:54.094 --> 04:56.497
and look like
chicken soup.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.968
What?!

04:57.968 --> 05:01.201
Uh, but...who knows?

05:01.201 --> 05:03.474
Chicken soup could work.

05:06.076 --> 05:08.439
When I showed Krane
the Triton App,

05:08.439 --> 05:11.211
he did ask me to build in
a Doomsday virus.

05:11.211 --> 05:14.244
But I refused.

05:14.244 --> 05:16.046
Thank you, Douglas.

05:16.046 --> 05:18.118
That totally makes up
for the other 500 times

05:18.118 --> 05:20.090
you tried to take us out.

05:20.090 --> 05:22.923
Technically,
it was 522.

05:22.923 --> 05:26.056
You just didn't see me
hidden in the shadows.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.100
Krane must have
done it on his own.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.162
And if he did it
to the Triton App,

05:32.162 --> 05:33.934
then that means...

05:35.105 --> 05:37.037
( whirring, beeping )

05:41.011 --> 05:42.813
The other students
have it too!

05:42.813 --> 05:44.815
It all makes sense.

05:44.815 --> 05:47.217
Krane was an egomaniac.

05:47.217 --> 05:49.720
If he wasn't around
to control his own creations,

05:49.720 --> 05:51.882
he wanted to make sure
no one else could.

05:51.882 --> 05:54.655
According to this,
anyone who had the Triton App

05:54.655 --> 05:56.657
will self-destruct
in ten hours.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.258
That means that
everyone here is--

05:58.258 --> 06:00.090
A ticking time bomb.

06:00.090 --> 06:02.332
All the bionic students
are gonna die?!

06:05.235 --> 06:07.598
Probably shouldn't have
said that so loudly.

06:07.598 --> 06:09.369
Nice knowing
all of you!

06:09.369 --> 06:11.542
You guys should
start your goodbyes.

06:11.542 --> 06:13.103
I'm gonna grab
a tarp and a poncho.

06:14.805 --> 06:16.246
Oh, no.

06:16.246 --> 06:17.778
This may be worse
than I thought.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.110
You right. I should probably
grab goggles, too.

06:20.110 --> 06:21.081
No, wait.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.686
( whirring, beeping )

06:27.988 --> 06:29.289
Just as I thought.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.321
We also had the Triton App,

06:31.321 --> 06:34.064
so we're set to
self-destruct, too.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.999
Adam, I'll take a poncho.

06:43.674 --> 06:44.975
It's gonna be okay.

06:44.975 --> 06:46.907
Douglas and Chase
are geniuses,

06:46.907 --> 06:48.579
and they have a whole nine hours
to figure out

06:48.579 --> 06:50.140
how to stop the virus.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.142
You know what?
You're right.

06:54.144 --> 06:56.016
We're gonna die!!!

06:57.648 --> 06:59.650
But I'm way too young!

06:59.650 --> 07:01.291
I have, like,
thirty more years left

07:01.291 --> 07:03.193
of being really, really cute.

07:03.193 --> 07:05.456
Really? I was thinking
more like ten.

07:05.456 --> 07:06.797
Do you want to die
right now?

07:11.562 --> 07:14.404
There are so many things
I never got a chance to do.

07:14.404 --> 07:20.210
Like...come up with a list
of things I never had
a chance to do!

07:20.210 --> 07:21.812
Well, I am not
just gonna sit here

07:21.812 --> 07:24.545
and let the last few hours
of my life pass me by.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.376
Me neither!
If I'm going out,

07:26.376 --> 07:29.049
I want to be remembered
for doing something meaningful!

07:29.049 --> 07:30.851
You mean like being
a bionic hero

07:30.851 --> 07:32.483
and saving
thousands of lives?

07:32.483 --> 07:35.225
No. Like blowing up balloons.

07:36.927 --> 07:39.059
I'm gonna use
my enhanced lung capacity

07:39.059 --> 07:41.231
to blow up as many balloons
as I can

07:41.231 --> 07:42.793
and set the world record.

07:42.793 --> 07:44.434
Hmm. Of course you are.

07:46.236 --> 07:48.499
Well, I'm gonna throw myself
an awesome farewell party.

07:48.499 --> 07:50.541
I'm gonna invite
all my friends from high school.

07:50.541 --> 07:52.643
You don't have any friends
from high school.

07:52.643 --> 07:54.204
Actually, I have tons.

07:54.204 --> 07:56.146
I just never brought them
around you guys because--

08:01.481 --> 08:04.114
Well, that about
says it all.

08:07.718 --> 08:10.290
Okay, I scanned S-1's chip

08:10.290 --> 08:12.292
and mirrored
the Doomsday virus timer.

08:12.292 --> 08:15.125
Only eight hours left
till you guys...

08:15.125 --> 08:17.628
show the world
what you're made of.

08:17.628 --> 08:21.301
Ohh! My head!
It hurts!

08:21.301 --> 08:23.834
I know,
his jokes are awful.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.506
No, she's having
another flashback!

08:26.506 --> 08:28.539
I'm starting
to see Krane again.

08:28.539 --> 08:31.311
It's dark, he's angry...

08:31.311 --> 08:34.044
Run toward the light!
It's your only hope!

08:36.116 --> 08:38.948
Is he saying anything
about the Doomsday virus?

08:38.948 --> 08:44.254
No. Someone used
the last of the battery acid
and didn't replace it.

08:44.254 --> 08:48.058
Well, it wasn't me.

08:48.058 --> 08:51.331
There has to be a way
to access this virus
and disable it.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.362
Good luck with that.

08:52.362 --> 08:54.204
He buried it in so many layers
of encryption

08:54.204 --> 08:55.866
it would take months
to crack it.

08:55.866 --> 08:58.468
Well, do you think
he ever gave her the code?

08:58.468 --> 09:00.340
I know one way
we can find out.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.342
When patients
lose their memories,

09:02.342 --> 09:04.615
sometimes doctors
try to recover them

09:04.615 --> 09:07.277
by reenacting scenes
from their pasts.

09:07.277 --> 09:09.479
If we can do with S-1,

09:09.479 --> 09:11.421
maybe we can trigger
the memories we need.

09:11.421 --> 09:13.323
Yes! That's brilliant!

09:13.323 --> 09:15.385
I know! I said it!

09:15.385 --> 09:17.227
Let's get to work.

09:17.227 --> 09:19.029
Whatever's locked
in that girl's head

09:19.029 --> 09:21.531
is the only thing
that's gonna save all of us.

09:25.796 --> 09:26.797
You!

09:26.797 --> 09:28.538
Who are you?

09:28.538 --> 09:29.600
Maybe this'll remind you!

09:29.600 --> 09:30.801
Leo, no!

09:30.801 --> 09:32.142
Aaah!

09:35.005 --> 09:37.608
What do you mean, no?
I just saved your butts.

09:37.608 --> 09:39.479
No, you didn't!

09:39.479 --> 09:41.982
You just dug our graves.

09:50.891 --> 09:53.764
Come on, wake up, wake up!

09:53.764 --> 09:55.365
So I leave for one afternoon

09:55.365 --> 09:57.067
and now everyone
has hours to live?

09:57.067 --> 09:58.368
Why didn't you call me?

09:58.368 --> 10:01.301
Oh, I'm sorry. I've been
a little busy

10:01.301 --> 10:04.304
trying to find ways
not to blow up!

10:04.304 --> 10:07.577
I'm sorry, but that's simply
not good enough.

10:07.577 --> 10:09.780
She is still out of it.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.882
Leo, how could you
attack her?

10:11.882 --> 10:14.344
Look, with everyone
around here flip-flopping
between good and bad,

10:14.344 --> 10:15.786
it's hard to keep track.

10:15.786 --> 10:17.317
I have to stop myself
from taking you out

10:17.317 --> 10:19.049
five times a day.

10:19.049 --> 10:22.392
Guys. Focus. We to have to
find a way to revive S-1

10:22.392 --> 10:24.895
before every bionic
person here explodes!

10:24.895 --> 10:26.426
( device vibrates )

10:26.426 --> 10:29.259
Not now, FrizzyBizzy,
not now!

10:31.501 --> 10:33.363
Just to be clear,
since we didn't have

10:33.363 --> 10:35.105
the Triton App,
we're good, right?

10:35.105 --> 10:36.937
Yeah. In a few hours,

10:36.937 --> 10:39.910
you and I could literally be
the last ones standing.

10:41.672 --> 10:44.314
Probably best to keep that
to ourselves.

10:46.476 --> 10:47.678
She's waking up!

10:47.678 --> 10:48.819
Aaah!

10:52.422 --> 10:54.354
Did you say "she's waking up"
or "she has a knife"?

10:54.354 --> 10:56.486
'Cause I'm just saying,
those two sound very similar.

10:59.389 --> 11:00.731
( beep )

11:00.731 --> 11:02.132
People of Earth,

11:02.132 --> 11:04.965
I, the late Adam Davenport,

11:04.965 --> 11:09.139
am on my way to breaking the
world balloon-blowing record.

11:11.341 --> 11:12.843
Six hundred and eighty-five
down...

11:14.544 --> 11:16.576
four hundred and eighty thousand
to go.

11:21.051 --> 11:23.413
Chill.

11:23.413 --> 11:27.417
Adam, what are you doing?!

11:27.417 --> 11:28.719
( air escaping )

11:28.719 --> 11:31.291
Arggh!

11:31.291 --> 11:34.324
I told you, I'm having
my party in here.

11:34.324 --> 11:36.997
And I told you I'm breaking
a world record.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.930
Now back up and respect
my balloon boundaries.

11:39.930 --> 11:43.804
No! Get rid of these!
My guests are coming
any minute!

11:43.804 --> 11:47.007
I doubt it, not after
that rude invite you sent out.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.578
What rude invite?

11:48.578 --> 11:50.380
Check your phone.
It's right there.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.585
"You're all dear to me
so I'm having a party."

11:55.585 --> 11:57.347
Read it closely.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.822
"You're all...

12:01.822 --> 12:04.654
dead to me
 so I'm having a party"?!

12:04.654 --> 12:08.658
Oh, no. I was in such a rush
I didn't see the typo.

12:08.658 --> 12:11.461
Yeah, you also spelled
"Davenport" wrong.

12:11.461 --> 12:13.403
No, I didn't.

12:14.704 --> 12:17.407
Agree to disagree.

12:17.407 --> 12:19.669
I cannot believe this.

12:19.669 --> 12:23.313
All I wanted on my last day
was to have a party
with all my friends,

12:23.313 --> 12:25.475
and now I'm never
gonna get the chance.

12:25.475 --> 12:26.716
Hey, that's not true.

12:26.716 --> 12:28.979
They could still show up
to celebrate your funeral.

12:34.184 --> 12:35.625
She's awake.

12:35.625 --> 12:38.158
Don't even think about it.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.563
Sorry I took you out. Twice.

12:43.563 --> 12:47.998
Yeah, well, at least
you didn't use your bionics
full-strength.

12:47.998 --> 12:50.270
Yeah, that's right.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.772
I always dial it back
for the ladies.

12:55.445 --> 12:57.647
We think we found a way
to stimulate your memories

12:57.647 --> 13:00.450
by acting out some scenes
from your past with Krane.

13:00.450 --> 13:03.153
We're hoping that when
he gave you the Doomsday virus,

13:03.153 --> 13:05.415
he told you how
to deactivate it.

13:05.415 --> 13:08.688
So we're gonna reenact
that moment.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.761
I'm gonna play Krane,
and Chase will play you.

13:11.761 --> 13:14.524
Hold on. How come
you get to play Krane?

13:14.524 --> 13:17.397
Because I knew him
better than anybody.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.730
Plus, I do
a spot-on impression.

13:20.730 --> 13:24.134
I used to kill
at our dinner parties.

13:24.134 --> 13:27.177
And then he'd threaten
to kill me.

13:27.177 --> 13:30.710
Well, I'm definitely
not gonna play S-1.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.182
No offense.

13:32.182 --> 13:34.384
Why not? Too much of a stretch
for you

13:34.384 --> 13:37.047
to reach that level of macho?

13:37.047 --> 13:38.989
No offense.

13:38.989 --> 13:42.853
Guys, we don't have time
to argue.

13:42.853 --> 13:46.556
But just for the record,
I do think you'd make
a great S-1.

13:46.556 --> 13:48.058
You want to borrow
Bree's boots?

13:48.058 --> 13:49.930
You can stuff some paper
in there so they fit.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.102
Can we just do this?!

13:52.102 --> 13:55.235
You're on an operating table
in Krane's lab.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.309
It's dark. You're terrified.

13:59.309 --> 14:01.571
The madman approaches.

14:03.874 --> 14:06.046
( evil chuckle )

14:07.777 --> 14:09.649
I'm Victor Krane,

14:09.649 --> 14:11.651
and I want to take over
the world!

14:11.651 --> 14:13.253
( evil laughter )

14:13.253 --> 14:15.655
I also told Douglas
I'd take him on a vacation

14:15.655 --> 14:18.488
to the Florida Keys--
never happened!

14:19.930 --> 14:21.631
Now you.

14:21.631 --> 14:23.593
Ahem.

14:23.593 --> 14:25.896
(falsetto) Oh, no! Mr. Krane!

14:25.896 --> 14:30.140
Please don't give me, S-1,
that bad, bad virus!

14:32.702 --> 14:36.246
I don't suppose
this is helping you
remember anything.

14:36.246 --> 14:41.211
No. But it is making me hope
that when I do blow up,
I take these two out with me.

14:42.812 --> 14:44.414
No offense.

14:47.117 --> 14:49.689
So, when I saw
how sad you were,

14:49.689 --> 14:53.193
I quit blowing up my balloons
and tried to figure out a way
to cheer you up.

14:53.193 --> 14:56.626
So you called all my friends
from Mission Creek

14:56.626 --> 14:59.199
to convince them
to come to the party?
You bet!

14:59.199 --> 15:02.602
And they all said no.

15:02.602 --> 15:06.236
But don't worry. I got you
the next best thing.

15:06.236 --> 15:08.238
Surprise!

15:08.238 --> 15:10.640
ALL: Surprise.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.282
( coughing )

15:12.282 --> 15:15.215
Wow! Heh heh heh.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.017
Who are these people?

15:17.017 --> 15:19.649
Your new friends.
Or, as I like to call 'em,

15:19.649 --> 15:21.651
random people
I picked up on the pier.

15:23.253 --> 15:25.425
Why would you do that?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.027
Because your real friends
don't like you.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.598
We've been over this.

15:28.598 --> 15:30.600
Look, you said
you wanted a party,

15:30.600 --> 15:32.062
and since no one
was gonna come,

15:32.062 --> 15:33.833
I figured I had
to do something.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.105
And don't worry.

15:35.105 --> 15:37.607
Took a lot less effort
than it looks.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.870
You know, Adam,

15:40.870 --> 15:43.673
in a weird way
I am really touched.

15:43.673 --> 15:46.716
If this is my last day on Earth,
I'm glad I'm going out

15:46.716 --> 15:48.278
knowing my brother loves me.

15:48.278 --> 15:50.180
Hmm. And I'm glad
I'm going out

15:50.180 --> 15:52.152
knowing all of
our valuable possessions

15:52.152 --> 15:54.384
will be stolen
by these lovely drifters.

15:59.489 --> 16:02.632
Role playing didn't work,
decrypting the virus
didn't work--

16:02.632 --> 16:04.794
I'm out of options!
Hey, guys,
any progress?

16:04.794 --> 16:07.097
Oh, great,
more mess to clean up!

16:09.699 --> 16:12.502
This is useless!
There's no fix.

16:12.502 --> 16:14.804
What do you mean
there's no fix?

16:14.804 --> 16:17.347
I'm not having Krane's virus
take me out.

16:17.347 --> 16:19.109
I'd rather have
one of you guys do it.

16:19.109 --> 16:21.281
Oh, Adam,
that's ridiculous.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.854
No. He's right.

16:24.854 --> 16:28.188
Okay,
if you say so.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.889
Give me that!

16:29.889 --> 16:32.922
I know what to do.
A virus needs a carrier,

16:32.922 --> 16:35.125
and without the carrier,
the virus dies.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.766
So what are you saying?

16:36.766 --> 16:37.897
We need to trick the virus

16:37.897 --> 16:39.329
into thinking we're dead.

16:39.329 --> 16:41.171
Good idea. We'll be ghosts.

16:41.171 --> 16:43.773
Bree, go get the sheets.
I'll cut out the eye holes.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.078
If we give ourselves
our own Doomsday virus,

16:48.078 --> 16:50.740
it'll shut down
our bionic infrastructures.

16:50.740 --> 16:54.914
Great plan, Chase,
except you forgot
one little thing:

16:54.914 --> 16:56.716
We'll be dead.

16:56.716 --> 17:00.750
Only temporarily.
We can control our own virus.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.993
As long as Douglas starts
uninstalling it right after
it takes effect,

17:03.993 --> 17:05.994
none of us
will actually die.

17:05.994 --> 17:09.059
So our lives
depend on this guy?

17:09.059 --> 17:10.829
And we're all
okay with that?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.704
The plan's too risky.
We're not doin' it!

17:14.704 --> 17:16.566
We only have
two minutes left!

17:16.566 --> 17:17.867
What else are we gonna do?

17:17.867 --> 17:20.869
There has to be
another way!

17:20.869 --> 17:23.813
I have a firewall program
on my old laptop.

17:23.813 --> 17:26.175
If the codes match,
it could block the virus.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.617
I'll be right back.

17:29.919 --> 17:31.751
We don't have time to wait.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.953
We have to install
our own Doomsday virus.

17:35.185 --> 17:37.457
Attention, everyone!

17:37.457 --> 17:41.861
I'm about to wirelessly install
a lethal virus into your chips.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.993
But I'm doing it to save you.

17:43.993 --> 17:46.536
And if for some reason
it doesn't work,

17:46.536 --> 17:49.769
well, you can all forget
about last night's homework.

17:51.401 --> 17:52.902
Chase, what are you doing?

17:52.902 --> 17:54.944
Don't you need Douglas
to bring everyone back?

17:54.944 --> 17:56.546
No. We have you.

17:57.747 --> 17:59.949
Who "you"? Me "you"?

17:59.949 --> 18:00.950
Yes, you.

18:00.950 --> 18:03.052
Look, Leo, don't worry.

18:03.052 --> 18:05.555
As soon as I send the virus
to all of our chips,

18:05.555 --> 18:07.887
I'll tell you exactly
how to uninstall it.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.018
Fine.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.362
But we only have
thirty seconds left. Hurry!

18:12.362 --> 18:13.523
Okay!

18:14.564 --> 18:17.066
( beeping )

18:17.066 --> 18:21.571
Okay, the virus is installed.
Leo, all you have to do is--

18:25.475 --> 18:26.976
No.

18:26.976 --> 18:28.278
No. No!

18:28.278 --> 18:30.880
No. No. No.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.342
No! No!

18:33.343 --> 18:35.715
What did you do?!

18:35.715 --> 18:37.847
It wasn't me! It was Chase!

18:37.847 --> 18:40.520
I told him not
to install the virus,
but he did it anyway!

18:40.520 --> 18:42.091
He is trouble, that one--
trouble!

18:42.091 --> 18:43.893
Get out of the way!

18:45.895 --> 18:48.958
Krane's Doomsday virus
deactivated.

18:48.958 --> 18:51.301
Now I'll just have
to uninstall Chase's.

18:51.301 --> 18:53.663
Come on, come on...

18:53.663 --> 18:55.935
( beeping )

18:55.935 --> 18:58.268
Why isn't anyone waking up?
I don't know.

18:58.268 --> 18:59.869
What do you mean
you don't know?

18:59.869 --> 19:01.271
They can't go much longer
without oxygen!

19:01.271 --> 19:03.012
It's not my virus!

19:03.012 --> 19:04.043
I'm doing my best!

19:05.745 --> 19:06.946
Great job, Professor.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.248
Chase's virus is still active

19:08.248 --> 19:10.780
because you forgot
to hit Enter.

19:10.780 --> 19:12.752
Well, I probably
didn't hit it because
I was busy doing--

19:12.752 --> 19:14.324
Hit! It!

19:19.959 --> 19:21.991
Aw, come on!

19:29.499 --> 19:31.741
( all gasping, coughing )

19:37.207 --> 19:40.109
We're alive.
And no one blew up.

19:40.109 --> 19:41.281
( loud pop )

19:41.281 --> 19:42.912
The students
in the training area!

19:42.912 --> 19:44.484
No!
No!
No!

19:45.955 --> 19:47.957
( popping )

19:47.957 --> 19:50.119
Adam, what are you doing?

19:50.119 --> 19:52.692
Trying to make you think
students were popping.

19:54.664 --> 19:57.096
Don't just stand there.
Help me pop!

19:57.096 --> 19:59.028
Eh, why not?

19:59.028 --> 20:01.331
( balloons popping )

20:01.331 --> 20:03.903
Okay. All right,
listen up.

20:03.903 --> 20:08.137
I know we're all having fun
celebrating being alive
and stuff,

20:08.137 --> 20:11.381
but your homework
 is due tomorrow.

20:11.381 --> 20:15.285
Only you could make
being brought back to life
a buzz-kill.

20:17.747 --> 20:19.749
( balloons popping )

20:24.524 --> 20:26.125
I've got the tarp.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.298
I'm gonna go
blow somethin' up.

20:31.130 --> 20:35.204
Well, I'm happy to say
we're all virus-free.

20:35.204 --> 20:37.066
ALL: Whoo!

20:37.066 --> 20:40.540
Speak for yourself.
I caught something nasty.

20:40.540 --> 20:44.113
That is the last time
I buy used balloons.

20:44.113 --> 20:46.876
Yeah. No, it's not.

20:49.819 --> 20:53.222
So, does this mean
we can finally put
our past behind us?

20:53.222 --> 20:54.984
I guess.

20:54.984 --> 20:58.027
But just in case you decide
to get all evil again,

20:58.027 --> 21:00.189
I'm rockin' a bionic leg now.

21:00.189 --> 21:02.432
( loud clank )

21:02.432 --> 21:04.193
(laughing) I'm sorry.

21:04.193 --> 21:07.667
I want to be intimidated by you,
but I just can't.

21:09.168 --> 21:10.970
Look...

21:10.970 --> 21:12.772
let's just make
a fresh start

21:12.772 --> 21:14.804
and see where it goes
from there.

21:14.804 --> 21:16.976
Deal. I'm just glad

21:16.976 --> 21:18.808
I'm not getting
those flashbacks anymore.

21:18.808 --> 21:21.751
Hey! Guys, look,
I found two more.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.719
Hang around here long enough

21:29.719 --> 21:31.991
and you'll have plenty
of other horrifying memories

21:31.991 --> 21:33.563
to replace 'em with.

21:40.099 --> 21:43.072
