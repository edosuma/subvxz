00:07.637 --> 00:11.471
It's 4:25, and this is Dr Frasier Crane.

00:11.811 --> 00:15.963
- Who's our next caller?
- Hank has trouble with his neighbours.

00:16.318 --> 00:18.912
Hello, Hank, I'm listening.

00:19.197 --> 00:21.586
- (Hank) 'Am I on?'
- Yes, you're on the air.

00:21.869 --> 00:24.702
(Hank) 'Hello, am I on?'

00:24.999 --> 00:29.709
Hank, listen. Turn down your radio
and just talk into your phone.

00:30.091 --> 00:31.729
(Hank) 'Hello?'

00:31.969 --> 00:36.201
You won't be able to hear yourself.
We're on a seven-second delay.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.393
'Hello, can you hear me?'

00:39.690 --> 00:42.250
For crying out loud! Thank you, Hank.

00:42.528 --> 00:45.281
People, turn off your damn radios!

00:46.785 --> 00:49.538
Ah, no, I mean just those of you
who are calling in!

00:49.831 --> 00:51.503
Who's our next caller?

00:51.752 --> 00:55.222
Marco has relationship problems.

00:55.549 --> 00:58.302
Hello, Marco, I'm listening.

00:58.596 --> 01:03.033
(Marco) 'l started seeing this woman
two years ago.

01:03.396 --> 01:07.674
'l think it was two years.
It was around Thanksgiving...

01:08.028 --> 01:10.496
'Yeah,
the leaves were off the trees and...'

01:10.783 --> 01:12.739
Close enough.

01:14.163 --> 01:16.119
What is your problem?

01:16.376 --> 01:19.925
'It's not really my problem,
it's more like her problem.

01:20.257 --> 01:24.136
- 'She's pressing me for a commitment.'
- What's holding you back?

01:24.472 --> 01:30.866
'l want to keep my options open,
in case somebody better comes along.'

01:32.360 --> 01:34.920
"Somebody better comes along."

01:35.198 --> 01:39.874
"Somebody better comes along!"
Marco, do you hear yourself?

01:40.248 --> 01:45.083
'No, I turned my radio off
after you blasted that other guy.'

01:48.721 --> 01:52.714
Listen, I suggest you give
your motives a thorough examination,

01:53.060 --> 01:56.655
and if you can't commit,
it's best for both of you to break it off.

01:56.984 --> 02:00.260
- 'Yeah?'
- Yeah! Thank you for your call.

02:01.450 --> 02:04.362
Tell me, what is it with guys like that?

02:04.663 --> 02:08.211
Hey, Roz, you've been
around the block a few times.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.660
Ever run into a guy like Marco?

02:10.924 --> 02:12.880
Oh, they're all Marcos.

02:13.178 --> 02:16.170
You can't swing
a dead cat without hitting a Marco.

02:16.475 --> 02:20.184
If that was so,
no one would be having a relationship.

02:20.523 --> 02:24.357
Well, I'm not,
my sister's not, none of my friends are.

02:24.696 --> 02:27.494
I've seen the future. Its name is Marco.

02:29.287 --> 02:33.644
What do you think, Seattle?
Are there any non-Marcos out there,

02:34.003 --> 02:38.872
or is Roz destined to live a life
of hopeless, loveless spinsterhood?

02:39.262 --> 02:41.093
Back after this.

02:41.349 --> 02:44.307
Gee, I just love it
when you include me in your show.

02:44.604 --> 02:45.559
(Indistinct)

02:49.362 --> 02:51.637
This is weird.
It's not even Halloween yet.

02:51.908 --> 02:54.058
Do we have to do this now?

02:54.328 --> 02:57.957
Yes, if we want a picture
for the Christmas card.

02:58.294 --> 03:01.286
Why can't we just do
what my wife and I did -

03:01.591 --> 03:06.062
put Frasier and Niles, in matching
sweaters, on the old Packard.

03:06.432 --> 03:09.663
Well, this year we're going to be
a little more artistic.

03:09.979 --> 03:12.174
Where is Frasier? I could use help.

03:12.442 --> 03:15.991
He's still napping.
My grandfather used to nap every day.

03:16.365 --> 03:18.595
- He lived to be 93.
- Really?

03:18.869 --> 03:21.861
He'd lie there on the sofa,
and you couldn't wake him.

03:22.166 --> 03:24.919
Grammy would say,
"He might as well be a dead man."

03:25.213 --> 03:29.092
Then, one day, we couldn't wake him.

03:30.722 --> 03:33.441
He really was a dead man.

03:33.727 --> 03:40.200
Poor Grammy. For weeks, she kept
insisting: "'E's napping, 'e's napping."

03:40.655 --> 03:43.692
OK, I'm going to turn it on.

03:45.329 --> 03:47.718
Oh, it's lovely!

03:48.000 --> 03:51.037
(Both)
# Deck the halls with boughs of holly

03:51.339 --> 03:53.295
# Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

03:53.552 --> 03:55.747
# 'Tis the season to be jolly

03:56.013 --> 03:58.368
# Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

03:58.643 --> 04:00.873
# Don we now our gay apparel

04:01.147 --> 04:03.377
# Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la... #

04:03.651 --> 04:07.769
Excuse me, excuse me.
Exactly how long have I been asleep?

04:10.580 --> 04:13.652
Good, you're up.
Now we can get this picture taken.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.555
- What picture?
- The picture for the Christmas card.

04:17.884 --> 04:18.839
Oh, right.

04:19.051 --> 04:23.124
The theme is Santa's workshop.
Put on your little elf hats.

04:23.475 --> 04:28.629
I'm not putting this on my head!
I'm a respected professional!

04:29.027 --> 04:31.541
But if you don't, it'll look stupid!

04:33.993 --> 04:36.666
The ship has already sailed on that one.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.411
- Put the hat on!
- You can't tell me what to do.

04:40.670 --> 04:42.467
I am telling you.

04:42.716 --> 04:47.506
You can no longer sit me
on top of some stupid old Packard!

04:47.891 --> 04:52.043
Boys, please, don't fight!
Are you forgetting what day it is?

04:52.398 --> 04:54.593
It's October 21!

04:56.864 --> 05:00.300
- Can we just get the picture taken?
- I've got it all set.

05:00.620 --> 05:02.736
15 seconds, gents.

05:02.999 --> 05:04.955
Oh wait, where's Eddie?

05:05.211 --> 05:08.089
In the bathroom,
getting a drink. Eddie!

05:15.603 --> 05:20.119
Well, I can always pray
there's a postal strike.

05:22.281 --> 05:25.830
That's it for today.
This is Dr Frasier Crane saying,

05:26.162 --> 05:29.996
"Go out there
and make it a great evening, Seattle."

05:30.878 --> 05:34.348
Hey, there's a fan
in the hall who'd like your autograph.

05:34.676 --> 05:38.066
Oh, God, save me
from my adoring fans.

05:39.602 --> 05:42.321
Oh! But not from the adorable ones.

05:46.946 --> 05:51.622
Hello. You wanted an autograph?
Uh, how should I make this out?

05:51.997 --> 05:54.670
You disgust me, you parasitic fraud!

05:54.960 --> 05:58.794
That's certainly different
from the usual "Best Regards".

05:59.133 --> 06:03.729
For once you'll face the consequences
of hanging up on callers!

06:04.100 --> 06:06.091
What consequences?

06:06.354 --> 06:10.108
I'm Marco's girlfriend...
Excuse me, ex-girlfriend, thanks to you.

06:10.444 --> 06:12.639
The Marco who didn't want to commit?

06:12.906 --> 06:17.502
You damned radio shrinks.
You couldn't just tell him to stick with it!

06:17.872 --> 06:22.070
That doesn't get big ratings. No!
"Get on with your life and ruin hers."

06:22.421 --> 06:25.936
- That's entertainment.
- Hold on. Did you listen to the show?

06:26.262 --> 06:30.460
- No, but Marco told me what you said.
- Oh, he did, did he?

06:30.811 --> 06:35.248
Did he mention he only stayed
with you to keep his options open?

06:36.904 --> 06:40.863
He said he only stayed with you
until somebody better came along.

06:42.622 --> 06:44.931
- He said that?
- To most of Seattle.

06:45.209 --> 06:48.599
Apparently, you're the only one
who missed it.

06:50.259 --> 06:52.614
So,
it wasn't that he didn't want to commit.

06:52.888 --> 06:56.005
He just didn't want to commit to me.

06:56.311 --> 07:00.941
I'm sorry I had to tell you,
but at least now you know the truth.

07:02.112 --> 07:03.431
Oh, no...

07:03.656 --> 07:06.807
Don't...don't cry.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.394
Look, you're...

07:08.623 --> 07:11.217
You're in a place of business here.

07:16.553 --> 07:20.068
Boy, I can really pick 'em, can't l?

07:20.392 --> 07:23.065
Don't go there.
Look, this is not your fault.

07:23.356 --> 07:28.589
You're a terrifically attractive young
woman, maybe a bit overemotional...

07:32.245 --> 07:34.964
Oh, yes, there, there, shh.

07:35.250 --> 07:39.402
- Listen, can I get you something?
- Mm-mm.

07:39.758 --> 07:42.272
- A drink of water?
- No.

07:42.553 --> 07:44.032
M & M's?

07:46.644 --> 07:49.078
Plain or peanut?

07:49.357 --> 07:52.315
- Whichever you like.
- Peanut.

07:58.539 --> 08:02.851
God, I should have seen this coming.
He almost had a coronary,

08:03.213 --> 08:06.205
when I brought a toothbrush over
to keep at his apartment.

08:06.510 --> 08:11.982
- Thank you. You want one?
- Uh, no, thanks. Have a seat.

08:12.395 --> 08:16.707
Listen, if he was that resistant,
why did you stay with him?

08:17.069 --> 08:19.025
I had a lot invested in it.

08:19.281 --> 08:23.115
Why settle for someone
who isn't madly in love with you?

08:23.455 --> 08:25.571
Right now
I'm not sure there are any men

08:25.834 --> 08:28.553
who are capable of falling madly in love.

08:28.839 --> 08:30.272
There are.

08:30.508 --> 08:33.419
Men and women
are basically the same.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.759
We both need to be loved
and to love someone,

08:37.061 --> 08:41.259
we both want to feel
that we matter to someone.

08:41.610 --> 08:44.807
Making a commitment
to another human being

08:45.115 --> 08:47.754
is the ultimate expression
of our humanity.

08:48.037 --> 08:51.666
Wow.
Your wife is really lucky.

08:52.002 --> 08:57.156
Well, I'm...
sure she'd say the same thing.

08:57.552 --> 09:00.624
Especially now
that our marriage is over.

09:00.933 --> 09:03.845
Maybe I will have one of those M & M's.

09:05.942 --> 09:11.016
Oh, boy...
Why are relationships always so hard?

09:13.036 --> 09:17.746
- Hey! You like the yellow ones too?
- People tell you they're the same.

09:18.129 --> 09:20.484
- But they're not!
- No!

09:20.757 --> 09:22.987
Relationships don't have to be hard.

09:23.262 --> 09:28.655
I heard of a documented case where
a man and a woman met, got along,

09:29.063 --> 09:31.861
and actually lived happily ever after.

09:33.487 --> 09:37.275
I don't mind the happily-ever-after-part.
It's the dating part.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.735
If I have to tell one more stranger
the story of my life

09:41.041 --> 09:44.113
over Northern Italian cuisine,
I'll choke on a breadstick!

09:44.422 --> 09:49.257
I know. Maybe we could just
exchange résumés over appetisers.

09:49.638 --> 09:53.870
- I usually say goodbye over appetisers.
- At least you're not stuck with the bill.

09:54.229 --> 09:57.107
You haven't dated much lately,
have you?

09:59.321 --> 10:02.996
No. I usually end up
in restaurants alone.

10:03.328 --> 10:05.364
I can't do that.

10:05.623 --> 10:07.818
I even turn on the TV at home

10:08.086 --> 10:10.156
so it feels
like there's someone else there.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.407
Is that what you'll be doing tonight?

10:18.186 --> 10:23.658
Well, unless I just keep eating M & M's,
which is a distinct possibility.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:32.167 --> 10:37.878
Soft and supple, yet strong right down
to the beautiful almond-shaped nails.

10:38.302 --> 10:41.612
- You really see all that in my hand?
- Mm-hm.

10:43.144 --> 10:45.100
I'm late for work.

10:45.355 --> 10:50.793
Wait. What are we doing tonight?
"Antonio's", "Le Cigare Volant"?

10:51.198 --> 10:54.747
- Why don't we just stay in?
- That's a great idea!

10:55.080 --> 11:00.359
I'll send Dad and Daphne to the movies.
I'll cook for you. Be at my place at 8:00.

11:00.755 --> 11:02.905
I won't make it till 8:30. I must change.

11:03.177 --> 11:06.533
No! Don't ever change.
I like you just the way you are.

11:06.849 --> 11:07.838
(Groans)

11:08.059 --> 11:10.368
Come on, I'm a little out of practice!

11:11.648 --> 11:13.878
I'll see you later, OK?

11:19.286 --> 11:20.605
Bye.

11:29.220 --> 11:32.098
I'll dispense with
the usual adolescent teasing.

11:32.391 --> 11:35.144
Who was that babe-o-rama?

11:36.523 --> 11:40.801
You remind me of Bob Hope
when he dresses up as the Fonz.

11:43.117 --> 11:46.393
- Her name is Catherine.
- How long have you known her?

11:46.706 --> 11:49.504
- Three days.
- Have you two...?

11:49.795 --> 11:53.583
- No. As if it's any of your business.
- But you're...?

11:53.927 --> 11:55.883
Yes, soon!

11:58.184 --> 12:00.698
- We are talking about...?
- Of course we are!

12:04.987 --> 12:07.899
- Sex, right?
- Yes!

12:09.870 --> 12:11.542
(Clears throat)

12:11.789 --> 12:14.064
So... How did you two meet?

12:14.335 --> 12:17.930
She came down to the radio station
to chew me out.

12:18.259 --> 12:22.138
- You're kidding.
- No. Her boyfriend called the show.

12:22.473 --> 12:25.749
I advised him to break up with her.

12:27.106 --> 12:29.825
Frasier, where are your ethics?

12:30.111 --> 12:33.342
You can't date someone
who's involved with your patient.

12:33.659 --> 12:36.890
Marco is not a patient, he's a caller.
There's a huge difference.

12:37.207 --> 12:39.357
I talked to him days before I met her.

12:39.627 --> 12:42.016
Rationalisation, the last refuge of a...

12:42.298 --> 12:45.096
(Both talk at the same time)

12:46.805 --> 12:50.684
I am not rationalising!
There is nothing wrong here!

12:51.021 --> 12:54.650
As long as your conscience is clear.
Mine wouldn't be.

12:54.985 --> 12:58.136
Well, frankly, I don't care
about your conscience.

12:58.450 --> 13:02.728
I don't need your approval.
I don't need you for anything.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.881
My car's in the shop.
I need a ride home tonight.

13:06.171 --> 13:08.002
No problem.

13:12.348 --> 13:14.304
I've got news for you,

13:14.560 --> 13:16.835
Marco's on line two.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.020
Marco?

13:19.234 --> 13:23.671
The guy you got out of the
way so you could keep his girlfriend.

13:26.079 --> 13:28.354
- Ten seconds.
- I'm not talking to him.

13:28.624 --> 13:31.184
There's no way I'm talking to him!

13:31.462 --> 13:32.736
Three, two...

13:32.965 --> 13:36.844
Hi, we're back.
Roz, whom do we have on the line?

13:37.180 --> 13:39.978
We have Marco on line two.

13:42.564 --> 13:45.124
- Who's this on line three?
- Todd.

13:45.402 --> 13:47.393
Oops, we lost Todd.

13:49.743 --> 13:53.179
But lucky for you,
we still have Marco on line two.

13:53.498 --> 13:56.058
Thank you, Roz.

13:56.337 --> 13:58.726
- Hello, Marco.
- (Marco) 'Hi, Dr Crane.

13:59.008 --> 14:03.877
'l spoke to you and I took your advice -
I broke up with my girlfriend.'

14:04.266 --> 14:08.623
Well, what can I say but
"Bravo, Marco"?

14:08.982 --> 14:10.938
- Who's next?
- 'Wait!

14:11.195 --> 14:15.234
'You haven't heard my problem.
She's already dating someone else.'

14:15.577 --> 14:18.853
- It makes me nuts.
- What makes you think that?

14:19.166 --> 14:24.320
'The other night, I couldn't get her
on the phone. So I drove by her house,

14:24.717 --> 14:28.107
'and I saw her outside
talking to some guy in a black BMW.'

14:29.725 --> 14:33.434
Did you, er,
get a good look at the guy?

14:36.486 --> 14:40.274
'No, it was too dark.
I think I made a big mistake, Doc.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.813
'Should I ask her to take me back?'

14:43.081 --> 14:45.311
No! I mean, what I mean is...

14:45.585 --> 14:49.578
No. Marco, you don't want
your ex-girlfriend back -

14:49.925 --> 14:52.120
you don't want
anybody else to have her.

14:52.388 --> 14:54.822
- 'Well, I...'
- No, it's called "jealousy".

14:55.100 --> 14:58.649
You must stop spying on her
and get on with your life.

14:58.982 --> 15:02.372
Borrow a page from my book:
move to a new city. A new state.

15:02.696 --> 15:05.768
Find out why
everyone's talking about Pittsburgh!

15:07.955 --> 15:11.311
We'll be right back
after these messages.

15:12.713 --> 15:14.704
What?

15:16.887 --> 15:19.606
- (Frasier) 'Thanks for picking me up.'
- No problem.

15:19.934 --> 15:22.926
Just a few miles out of my way.
At rush hour.

15:23.230 --> 15:27.348
But I didn't mind, really. Gave me
a chance to listen to your show.

15:27.696 --> 15:28.811
I see.

15:29.031 --> 15:31.386
I just have one question for you.

15:31.661 --> 15:34.050
Can you tell me
that your advice to Marco

15:34.332 --> 15:37.608
was based on his best interests,
and not on your own?

15:37.921 --> 15:40.993
That's an interesting question, Niles,
and I don't care.

15:41.301 --> 15:43.451
I'm in love, and I don't care.

15:43.722 --> 15:46.714
Catherine is mine now.
I'm in and Marco's out.

15:47.896 --> 15:50.888
- You're insane!
- Perhaps, but you just ran a stop sign.

15:51.193 --> 15:52.262
(Brakes screech)

15:52.487 --> 15:55.206
- Now we're in the intersection!
- Oh!

15:56.285 --> 16:00.483
I tell you, Niles,
I haven't felt this way in ages.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.791
There's an excitement about this.
I... I feel tingly.

16:07.052 --> 16:10.567
- What does your stomach say?
- My stomach?

16:10.892 --> 16:13.565
You know what I'm talking about.

16:13.856 --> 16:17.769
Whenever you approached
a breach of ethics, you'd get queasy.

16:18.112 --> 16:21.582
At least I didn't get
spontaneous nosebleeds.

16:21.910 --> 16:25.027
Remember when we lifted
that dollar from Mom's purse,

16:25.333 --> 16:28.769
we left a gruesome
trail back to the tree house that day.

16:29.088 --> 16:34.481
But, you see, you've proved my point.
I'm not the least bit queasy, I'm fine.

16:34.890 --> 16:38.246
My head, my heart,
my gastrointestinal system, all shout,

16:38.563 --> 16:40.155
"It's OK!"

16:41.568 --> 16:43.684
Niles, is this a new car?

16:43.946 --> 16:47.825
Yes, a patient of mine
got me a huge break on a lease.

16:50.917 --> 16:53.795
Frasier, do you have a handkerchief?

16:54.381 --> 16:56.212
(Car horn)

17:00.391 --> 17:03.588
Mm, that was the best
Salmon Marseille I've ever had.

17:03.896 --> 17:07.888
You should try
my Salmon "Enchanted Evening".

17:09.029 --> 17:12.021
- Tell me you didn't say that.
- Oh, it was just the Lafite talking.

17:12.327 --> 17:14.477
Lafite, don't fail me now!

17:15.833 --> 17:17.949
Oh, stop, stop!

17:22.093 --> 17:25.050
So...have you ever
made love in the kitchen?

17:25.348 --> 17:27.099
(Plates shatter)

17:28.729 --> 17:31.243
Well, the, uh...dishes are done.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.989
Oh! Mm!

17:43.170 --> 17:44.649
(Both pant)

17:46.258 --> 17:48.567
(Frasier)
'Ewww!'

17:50.181 --> 17:52.331
(Catherine)
'What?'

17:52.602 --> 17:56.356
I'm sorry,
I'm suddenly feeling a little queasy. I...

17:57.360 --> 18:00.193
Maybe I'm just not a kitchen person.

18:06.291 --> 18:08.361
Well, uh...

18:08.628 --> 18:12.621
Maybe you're just...
a little too warm, huh?

18:12.968 --> 18:14.287
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

18:14.513 --> 18:15.912
Yeah, that's it.

18:16.140 --> 18:19.849
- You look awfully warm too.
- Oh, I am! Yes.

18:20.189 --> 18:23.465
- Oh, my God!
- Oh! Oh!

18:25.906 --> 18:27.544
Ooh!

18:34.796 --> 18:36.548
I'm sorry.

18:36.799 --> 18:39.996
Would you mind
if we moved to the sofa?

18:40.305 --> 18:43.217
I won't be outperformed
by a Barcalounger.

18:43.519 --> 18:46.113
Oh... Oh!

18:46.816 --> 18:48.488
This is better.

18:48.736 --> 18:51.170
Oh, yes. Mm...

18:51.449 --> 18:53.246
Mm...

18:53.577 --> 18:55.488
Ewww!

18:55.748 --> 18:57.739
Ah...

18:58.961 --> 19:01.395
What? Was I kneeling on you?

19:01.674 --> 19:04.427
I need some fresh air. Are you OK?

19:04.721 --> 19:05.790
I'm fine.

19:06.014 --> 19:08.289
Oh, damn, it wasn't the fish!

19:09.186 --> 19:11.336
There's a bug going round.

19:12.650 --> 19:16.120
- It's not a bug.
- What is it, then?

19:17.283 --> 19:19.353
It's us.

19:19.620 --> 19:22.578
Every time we touch and kiss,
I get queasy.

19:24.336 --> 19:29.012
The thought of making love to me
makes you sick to your stomach?

19:29.386 --> 19:32.458
Yes, but don't take it personally.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.040
It's... It's not you, it's me.

19:38.317 --> 19:42.788
Every time I come close
to breaching my ethics, I get sick.

19:43.159 --> 19:44.717
What?

19:45.830 --> 19:50.142
Marco called and said
he wanted to get back with you.

19:50.504 --> 19:53.177
- I told him not to.
- So?

19:53.467 --> 19:58.746
Maybe I told him that not because
it was good for him but good for me.

19:59.144 --> 20:01.260
Oh, Frasier!

20:01.522 --> 20:03.911
Who cares?

20:04.193 --> 20:08.072
I care. Any psychiatrist worth his salt
would care.

20:08.409 --> 20:13.119
That's why we don't get involved
with our patients. Or their girlfriends.

20:15.421 --> 20:18.538
- Do you want to break up with me?
- I don't want to.

20:18.843 --> 20:22.233
I have to. If I don't,
I'll throw up all over your shoes.

20:25.228 --> 20:30.586
I can't believe this is happening.
How can this be so easy for you?

20:30.988 --> 20:33.183
Easy? This is killing me!

20:33.450 --> 20:36.169
I want to carry you
to that Eames classic

20:36.455 --> 20:40.004
and show you why it's
the best-engineered chair in the world!

20:41.338 --> 20:44.648
- Why don't you, then?
- I told you, I can't!

20:44.969 --> 20:48.518
Oh! And nothing I can say
will change your mind?

20:50.269 --> 20:51.543
I'm sorry.

20:51.772 --> 20:54.491
Well, thank you, Dr Crane!

20:55.862 --> 20:59.059
First you screw things up with Marco
and now you're dumping me!

20:59.368 --> 21:02.678
God, and to think
I was going to have sex with you!

21:02.998 --> 21:06.149
And it was going to be hot.

21:06.463 --> 21:09.853
Oh, like you've never had before!

21:10.177 --> 21:12.372
I'm talking steamy,

21:12.640 --> 21:17.156
sweat dripping down your back,
neighbours pounding on the walls.

21:17.523 --> 21:20.879
Illegal in 48 states kind of sex!

21:22.865 --> 21:26.062
But, hey. You're OK.
You won't be alone tonight.

21:26.371 --> 21:28.327
No, you've got your ethics!

21:28.583 --> 21:30.175
Oh!

21:33.007 --> 21:34.838
Oh, by the way,

21:35.093 --> 21:37.891
The fish was dry.

21:38.182 --> 21:41.458
Oh, that was a cheap shot!

21:57.547 --> 22:01.335
How I envy you, Eddie.
The biggest questions you face are:

22:01.679 --> 22:04.751
"Who's going to walk me?
Who's going to feed me?"

22:05.060 --> 22:08.814
I won't know that kind of joy
for another 40 years.

22:13.865 --> 22:18.734
# Baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.625 --> 22:20.774
# Quite stylish

22:21.002 --> 22:27.555
# Maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but I got you pegged!

22:28.306 --> 22:32.743
# But I don't know what do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:34.066 --> 22:36.375
# They're calling again #

22:36.820 --> 22:39.334
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
