What if I didn't make the team?

It'll be terrible.

I'll be humiliated.

But what if I did?

I should do?

for that in Japanese.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.333
- It was me.

08:13.375 --> 08:14.542
- Let me try that.

08:14.583 --> 08:16.667
It-was-me.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.500
- No, it was me.

08:18.542 --> 08:20.792
- It-was-me.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.917
- No, I called

08:20.834 --> 08:22.917
the tow truck company.

08:22.959 --> 08:24.542
- I don't speak Japanese, man.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.166
What are you saying?

08:26.208 --> 08:29.041
- I got the test postponed!

08:29.083 --> 08:31.917
- So my "it-was-me"

08:29.083 --> 08:31.917
was because of you?

08:31.959 --> 08:34.625
- Yes.

08:31.959 --> 08:34.625
Yes, it was.

08:34.667 --> 08:36.625
- You covered for me?

08:36.667 --> 08:37.959
- It's The Quad Code.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.792
Quads before quizzes.

08:39.834 --> 08:42.750
- Whoa, thanks, bro.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.917
You got a guy's car towed

08:42.792 --> 08:44.917
for me.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.458
You're a total rebel.

08:46.500 --> 08:50.333
- Well,

08:46.500 --> 08:50.333
say hello...

08:50.375 --> 08:53.458
to Rebel Ricky.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.250
- Can you imagine

08:53.500 --> 08:55.250
how much trouble you'd be in

08:55.291 --> 08:57.542
if Mr. Williams ever found out?

08:57.583 --> 08:59.709
- Trouble? What do you mean?

08:59.750 --> 09:01.625
- Well, first you'd get,

08:59.750 --> 09:01.625
like, a month of detention...

09:01.667 --> 09:03.333
- Detention?

09:03.375 --> 09:04.834
- Maybe even kicked out

09:03.375 --> 09:04.834
of school.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.458
- K-kicked out of school?

09:07.500 --> 09:10.709
But if I get kicked out,

09:07.500 --> 09:10.709
it'll ruin my permanent record,

09:10.750 --> 09:13.458
which means I definitely

09:10.750 --> 09:13.458
won't get into a good college,

09:13.500 --> 09:15.667
and instead of being the first

09:13.500 --> 09:15.667
lawyer-president-astronaut,

09:15.709 --> 09:18.125
I'm gonna be broke and alone,

09:15.709 --> 09:18.125
sleeping on your couch,

09:18.166 --> 09:21.709
eating your pizza scraps

09:18.166 --> 09:21.709
for the rest of my life!

09:21.750 --> 09:23.875
- Dude, don't worry.

09:23.917 --> 09:25.959
That's never gonna happen.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.125
I'd give you a month.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.125
Then you're out.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.458
- Excuse me,

09:33.667 --> 09:35.458
do you know what time it is?

09:35.500 --> 09:37.125
'Cause I do.

09:37.166 --> 09:41.458
It's wow-o'clock,

09:37.166 --> 09:41.458
and Dawn's buying!

10:02.625 --> 10:04.333
- Kyle, I'm working here.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.667
- Wow.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.583
- I got a wow?

10:26.625 --> 10:28.875
- Wrong kind of wow.

10:28.917 --> 10:30.291
Mm.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.625
- Nothing is working.

10:38.667 --> 10:41.417
Why won't my wow come out?

10:41.458 --> 10:45.041
Maybe I'm just wow-stipated.

10:45.083 --> 10:49.083
Or maybe I've lost my wow.

10:49.125 --> 10:50.291
You're right.

10:50.333 --> 10:52.041
I don't deserve to be

10:50.333 --> 10:52.041
on the team

10:52.083 --> 10:55.458
or "the team."

10:55.500 --> 10:57.083
Thanks for listening, Mary.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.250
- Whoa, this is my jam.

11:05.583 --> 11:06.750
- Hey, team.

11:13.417 --> 11:14.917
Nicky!

11:14.959 --> 11:19.083
I'm so sorry.

11:14.959 --> 11:19.083
I'll get napkins.

11:19.125 --> 11:20.709
[girls giggling]

11:20.750 --> 11:23.083
- That was hilarious, Dawn.

11:23.125 --> 11:24.500
- It was?

11:24.542 --> 11:26.959
- Total wow.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.667
- It was.

11:28.709 --> 11:30.750
- The way you made it look

11:28.709 --> 11:30.750
like an accident?

11:30.792 --> 11:32.166
[all laugh]

11:32.208 --> 11:34.667
- Yep,

11:32.208 --> 11:34.667
totally did that on purpose.

11:34.709 --> 11:36.583
But you knew that,

11:34.709 --> 11:36.583
'cause the proof

11:36.625 --> 11:37.834
was in the pudding.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.917
- [laughs]

11:39.959 --> 11:41.583
Congratulations, Dawn.

11:41.625 --> 11:43.792
Look like someone's ready for...

11:43.834 --> 11:46.667
this.

11:46.709 --> 11:48.083
- Don't worry, everybody.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.500
My sister's getting me napkins

11:48.125 --> 11:50.500
as we speak.

11:50.542 --> 11:53.041
She's totally got my back.

11:53.083 --> 11:57.750
[kids murmuring]

11:57.792 --> 12:00.792
- Oh, guess she doesn't.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.625
[girls laughing]

12:10.667 --> 12:12.583
- You know, Dawn,

12:10.667 --> 12:12.583
I'm going to go out on a limb

12:12.625 --> 12:14.625
and say that pudding

12:12.625 --> 12:14.625
is the new gloves.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.250
- I got lots of ways

12:14.667 --> 12:16.250
to wow you.

12:16.291 --> 12:18.792
But if you liked it,

12:18.834 --> 12:20.375
I'm not "pudding" up a fight.

12:20.417 --> 12:23.375
[laughter]

12:23.417 --> 12:25.417
- We'll see you

12:23.417 --> 12:25.417
at your dad's store.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.500
- See you there.

12:27.542 --> 12:28.750
[groans]

12:30.875 --> 12:31.959
Have you guys seen Nicky?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.959
I got to talk to him.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.959
- You can't.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.542
Mom picked him up

12:35.000 --> 12:38.542
after you "dessert-ed" him.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.625
- Was he mad at me?

12:38.583 --> 12:40.625
- He didn't say.

12:40.667 --> 12:41.959
- He couldn't.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.208
His face was crusted shut

12:42.000 --> 12:44.208
with pudding.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.458
- Oh, no.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.125
- Well, I'm off

12:50.250 --> 12:52.125
to Japanese Language Club.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.667
Sayonara.

12:53.709 --> 12:55.959
- Hey, Harpers.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.125
I was talking with the tow

12:56.000 --> 12:58.125
truck company, and apparently,

12:58.166 --> 13:01.333
a little boy called using

12:58.166 --> 13:01.333
a fake Japanese accent.

13:01.375 --> 13:03.333
And I know exactly who it was.

13:03.375 --> 13:04.667
- You do?

13:04.709 --> 13:06.208
- Of course I do, Ricky.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.542
[constricted]

13:06.250 --> 13:07.542
It was Dicky.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.667
Both: What?

13:07.583 --> 13:09.667
- Don't act innocent.

13:09.709 --> 13:10.834
You faked the X-ray,

13:09.709 --> 13:10.834
you faked...

13:10.875 --> 13:12.333
[constricted]

13:10.875 --> 13:12.333
your hand falling off,

13:12.375 --> 13:13.333
[normal voice]

13:12.375 --> 13:13.333
And you faked being

13:13.375 --> 13:14.667
concerned Japanese citizen...

13:14.709 --> 13:17.041
[constricted]

13:14.709 --> 13:17.041
Ricky-san.

13:17.083 --> 13:19.333
- Mr. Williams, I promise,

13:17.083 --> 13:19.333
it wasn't me.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.125
Ask Ricky.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.125
He'll tell you.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.667
- [constricted]

13:21.166 --> 13:23.667
Ricky?

13:23.709 --> 13:25.208
- Go ahead, Ricky.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.417
You like telling the truth,

13:25.250 --> 13:27.417
remember?

13:30.083 --> 13:32.083
Imagine how much trouble

13:30.083 --> 13:32.083
you'd be in?

13:32.125 --> 13:33.375
Month of detention,

13:33.417 --> 13:35.750
kicked out of school.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.750
Kicked out of school!

13:35.792 --> 13:36.917
It was me!

13:36.959 --> 13:38.792
- Dicky did it!

13:36.959 --> 13:38.792
- What?

13:38.834 --> 13:40.166
- I knew it. Detention.

13:40.208 --> 13:42.333
[constricted]

13:40.208 --> 13:42.333
Come with me.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.417
- What happened to quads

13:42.375 --> 13:44.417
before quizzes?

13:50.458 --> 13:51.834
- I don't want to hear it,

13:50.458 --> 13:51.834
Kyle.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.750
- Nicky, there you are.

14:00.792 --> 14:04.458
Here are those napkins

14:00.792 --> 14:04.458
just like I promised.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.000
- Little late.

14:06.041 --> 14:09.917
I spent two hours

14:06.041 --> 14:09.917
scraping pudding off my body.

14:09.959 --> 14:14.083
My face came off in one piece.

14:14.125 --> 14:15.709
- Nicky, it was an accident.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.375
I swear I would never

14:15.750 --> 14:18.375
do something like that to you on

14:15.750 --> 14:18.375
purpose.

14:18.417 --> 14:19.625
- I guess you're right.

14:19.667 --> 14:21.417
I know you wouldn't.

14:21.458 --> 14:22.500
- I'm really sorry.

14:22.542 --> 14:24.125
Are you mad at me?

14:24.166 --> 14:25.792
- How could I be mad?

14:25.834 --> 14:27.625
You wowed the soccer girls,

14:27.667 --> 14:29.834
mom bought me

14:27.667 --> 14:29.834
this sweet new track suit,

14:29.875 --> 14:34.083
and my face is pudding soft.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.375
- So we're cool?

14:35.417 --> 14:38.291
- We're cool.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.917
Now go make me proud.

14:45.125 --> 14:48.417
- How it goes, Buffaloes?

14:48.458 --> 14:51.542
- You know, Dawn, if you're

14:48.458 --> 14:51.542
gonna officially be one of us,

14:51.583 --> 14:55.333
you'll be needing one of these.

14:55.375 --> 14:56.917
- Wow.

14:55.375 --> 14:56.917
- You earned it.

14:56.959 --> 14:58.917
That pudding bit was hilar.

14:58.959 --> 15:00.291
- So hilar.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.667
Wish I could see it again.

15:01.709 --> 15:03.667
- Yep, too bad

15:01.709 --> 15:03.667
no one video-ed it

15:03.709 --> 15:07.667
so you could

15:03.709 --> 15:07.667
watch it over and over.

15:07.709 --> 15:09.959
- That's a great idea.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.333
You should dump pudding

15:10.000 --> 15:12.333
on your brother again,

15:12.375 --> 15:14.166
but this time,

15:12.375 --> 15:14.166
we'll get it with our phones.

15:14.208 --> 15:17.208
- You know, these things are

15:14.208 --> 15:17.208
never as funny the second time,

15:17.250 --> 15:18.625
so...

15:18.667 --> 15:21.667
So, about that headband?

15:21.709 --> 15:24.000
I got a head.

15:21.709 --> 15:24.000
You got a band.

15:24.041 --> 15:26.500
Let's make this happen.

15:24.041 --> 15:26.500
- Not yet.

15:26.542 --> 15:29.375
We have to get that on video.

15:29.417 --> 15:32.625
- But what if I don't want

15:29.417 --> 15:32.625
to dump pudding on Nicky again?

15:32.667 --> 15:34.667
- Sorry, Dawn, but we told you.

15:34.709 --> 15:36.667
Newbies have to do

15:34.709 --> 15:36.667
whatever the team says.

15:36.709 --> 15:38.041
- That's the way

15:36.709 --> 15:38.041
it's always been.

15:38.083 --> 15:39.417
It's tradition.

15:39.458 --> 15:41.834
- And now it's your turn.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.458
See you at lunch tomorrow.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.417
- Great news.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.083
Mom said

15:48.458 --> 15:50.083
I can wear this bad boy

15:50.125 --> 15:52.500
to school tomorrow as long as

15:50.125 --> 15:52.500
I don't get anything on it.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.125
- But I didn't call

15:59.959 --> 16:02.125
a tow truck.

16:02.166 --> 16:03.458
Why don't you believe me?

16:03.500 --> 16:05.792
- Because this year

16:03.500 --> 16:05.792
you have already set free

16:05.834 --> 16:08.250
a tank full of turtles

16:05.834 --> 16:08.250
to get out of a Biology test.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.834
- Faked an allergic reaction

16:08.291 --> 16:09.834
to pencils

16:09.875 --> 16:11.542
to get out of a Math test.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.417
- And let's not forget

16:11.583 --> 16:13.417
about the time you got out of

16:13.458 --> 16:16.250
an English essay by pretending

16:13.458 --> 16:16.250
to see a wolf outside.

16:16.291 --> 16:19.792
- You're literally the boy

16:16.291 --> 16:19.792
who cried wolf.

16:19.834 --> 16:21.542
- But I didn't do it this time.

16:21.583 --> 16:22.709
- Fine, Dicky.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.875
If you didn't do it,

16:22.750 --> 16:24.875
then who did?

16:24.917 --> 16:26.667
- I don't know who did it,

16:26.709 --> 16:28.583
but I wish whoever did

16:26.709 --> 16:28.583
would come forward

16:28.625 --> 16:32.709
and help a brother out.

16:32.750 --> 16:33.959
- Well, you're grounded.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.500
- For a month.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.500
- Ah, come on.

16:35.542 --> 16:38.542
That's six whole weeks.

16:38.583 --> 16:41.166
- It'll give you time to

16:38.583 --> 16:41.166
brush up on your Social Studies.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.875
- Maybe take a glance

16:41.208 --> 16:42.875
at a calendar.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.542
- Dude,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.542
how can you just sit there?

16:49.583 --> 16:50.917
Tell them the truth.

16:50.959 --> 16:52.333
- I can't tell the truth.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.542
My future's riding on this.

16:54.583 --> 16:55.917
I'm sorry.

16:55.959 --> 16:59.792
I wish I could be

16:55.959 --> 16:59.792
a bad boy like you, but I'm not.

16:59.834 --> 17:01.250
- You're right.

17:01.291 --> 17:02.709
You're not a bad boy.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.625
You're a bad guy.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.041
- White suit coming through.

17:17.625 --> 17:20.125
- Dawn?

17:20.166 --> 17:22.083
- Oh, hey!

17:22.125 --> 17:26.291
Didn't see you there

17:22.125 --> 17:26.291
at the place you always are.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.166
- What are you doing?

17:26.333 --> 17:28.166
Sit down.

17:31.458 --> 17:35.709
Look at this ginormous bowl

17:31.458 --> 17:35.709
of pudding.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.583
We're ready.

17:37.625 --> 17:41.709
- Yep, totally gonna do this.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.542
All right.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.208
Here I go.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.709
Better walk slow

17:45.250 --> 17:47.709
to avoid spilling.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.208
- Here you go.

17:57.250 --> 18:00.083
- I can get my own spork,

17:57.250 --> 18:00.083
Ricky.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.458
- Thought you weren't talking

18:00.125 --> 18:01.458
to me.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.792
- I'm not.

18:02.834 --> 18:05.458
Starting now.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.792
- Could you grab me

18:05.500 --> 18:06.792
some napkins, please?

18:06.834 --> 18:09.500
- Sure.

18:09.542 --> 18:11.125
Starting now.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.625
- Nicky told me what you did,

18:14.333 --> 18:16.625
Ricky.

18:16.667 --> 18:20.667
You<i> should</i> get

18:16.667 --> 18:20.667
the silent treatment.

18:20.709 --> 18:24.041
You should also get

18:20.709 --> 18:24.041
the strawberry pretzel salad.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.667
- Good news, dicky.

18:25.709 --> 18:28.542
I've got something fun

18:25.709 --> 18:28.542
planned for detention today.

18:28.583 --> 18:31.417
You'll be scraping chewing gum

18:28.583 --> 18:31.417
off the bottom of desks.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.000
And the nose gum.

18:33.041 --> 18:34.875
Know what I mean?

18:33.041 --> 18:34.875
- Yes.

18:34.917 --> 18:36.750
- That's boogers.

18:36.792 --> 18:38.250
- I said I know.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.542
- Lots and lots

18:38.291 --> 18:40.542
and lots of nose gum.

18:40.583 --> 18:42.667
In fact, there's almost

18:40.583 --> 18:42.667
no chewing gum at all.

18:42.709 --> 18:45.000
No, it's all nose gum.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.875
Which is boogers.

18:47.917 --> 18:49.041
- I called the tow truck.

18:49.083 --> 18:50.709
[constricted]

18:49.083 --> 18:50.709
- What?

18:50.750 --> 18:52.917
[normal voice]

18:50.750 --> 18:52.917
Ricky, you do not have to cover

18:50.750 --> 18:52.917
for your brother.

18:52.959 --> 18:54.959
- I'm not covering.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.291
It's the truth.

18:56.333 --> 18:58.834
- Dawn?

18:58.875 --> 19:01.083
You're still here.

19:03.083 --> 19:06.792
- Okay, here I go.

19:06.834 --> 19:08.458
Double time.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.917
- There's no way Ricky did this.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.917
- Yes, he did.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.917
- Why won't you just believe

19:14.959 --> 19:16.917
me?

19:16.959 --> 19:18.667
- Because you're Ricky.

19:18.709 --> 19:20.917
Everyone knows you

19:18.709 --> 19:20.917
don't have it in you.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.458
- If I didn't have it in me,

19:24.959 --> 19:27.458
would I do this?

19:32.500 --> 19:34.083
Both: Ricky!

19:34.125 --> 19:37.834
- That's for trying

19:34.125 --> 19:37.834
to dump pudding on Nicky.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.709
- You were going

19:37.875 --> 19:39.709
to dump pudding on me?

19:39.750 --> 19:42.709
Again?

19:39.750 --> 19:42.709
- On purpose.

19:42.750 --> 19:45.625
- Wow, Ricky,

19:42.750 --> 19:45.625
thanks for having my back.

19:52.750 --> 19:55.458
- What was that for?

19:55.500 --> 19:59.208
- For not having Dicky's back.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.458
- Thanks, Nicky.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.583
But Ricky just tried

20:00.500 --> 20:02.583
to make things right.

20:02.625 --> 20:05.625
So according to The Quad Code.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.750
- That's it.

20:07.750 --> 20:09.750
All three of you...

20:09.792 --> 20:11.583
[voice modulating]

20:09.792 --> 20:11.583
detention for the entire month.

20:11.625 --> 20:14.375
- That's 40 whole days!

20:14.417 --> 20:16.917
- And the next person

20:14.417 --> 20:16.917
who gets even a crumb of food

20:16.959 --> 20:19.667
on the floor gets to join them.

20:19.709 --> 20:21.709
- Sorry, Mr. Williams,

20:21.750 --> 20:23.667
I can't let my brothers

20:21.750 --> 20:23.667
go to detention alone.

20:23.709 --> 20:26.208
It's The Quad Code.

20:26.250 --> 20:27.667
- Not my face.

20:32.458 --> 20:35.458
- Well, at least there's enough

20:32.458 --> 20:35.458
nose gum for the four of you.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.667
That's boogers.

20:37.709 --> 20:39.333
[constricted]

20:37.709 --> 20:39.333
See you in detention.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.959
- [laughing]

20:41.667 --> 20:43.959
That was so hilar.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.333
- [laughing]

20:44.000 --> 20:46.333
It was hyster.

20:46.375 --> 20:50.125
- But we were laughing so hard

20:46.375 --> 20:50.125
we forgot to record it.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.208
You need to do it again.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.834
- No.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.166
- What?

20:55.208 --> 20:57.041
- Look, I want to be

20:55.208 --> 20:57.041
on the soccer team,

20:57.083 --> 21:01.250
but not if I can't be

20:57.083 --> 21:01.250
on this team.

21:01.291 --> 21:04.041
And I'm not gonna be a part

21:01.291 --> 21:04.041
of your dumb old traditions.

21:04.083 --> 21:07.667
The only way I should have to

21:04.083 --> 21:07.667
wow you is on the soccer field.

21:07.709 --> 21:09.625
- But this is the way

21:07.709 --> 21:09.625
it's always been.

21:09.667 --> 21:12.083
- Well,

21:09.667 --> 21:12.083
maybe it's time for a change.

21:12.125 --> 21:15.083
This school hasn't won

21:12.125 --> 21:15.083
a championship in 27 years,

21:15.125 --> 21:17.709
but I'm hoping

21:15.125 --> 21:17.709
we can end that tradition too.

21:19.959 --> 21:23.208
- Maybe we have been

21:19.959 --> 21:23.208
focusing on the wrong team.

21:23.250 --> 21:27.458
- Yeah, I didn't really like it

21:23.250 --> 21:27.458
when we were newbies.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.709
- Then maybe it's time

21:27.500 --> 21:29.709
we start some new traditions.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.458
See you at practice tomorrow,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.458
teammate.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.834
- Oh, I'll be there.

21:38.875 --> 21:43.125
Right after detention.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.750
- You know, there is an upside

21:43.166 --> 21:45.750
to getting dumped on.
