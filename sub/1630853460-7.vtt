20:21.178 --> 20:22.971
Can I help you, comrade?

20:23.430 --> 20:24.932
My name is Yuri Ismaylov.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.777
The warden is expecting me.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.071
I have a very special delivery for him.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.240
A rare import from America.

40:16.372 --> 40:17.540
 Yuri Ismaylov.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.253
At last, we meet.

40:22.753 --> 40:23.754
Comrade Major.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.341
This is the Bauman spy?

40:30.261 --> 40:32.138
He looks different.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.682
Uglier in person, I know.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.101
He also shaved his beard
to disguise himself.

40:37.184 --> 40:38.394
Tricky bastard.

40:46.569 --> 40:47.903
Now this one…

40:47.987 --> 40:50.573
This one I would recognize
a continent away.

40:50.656 --> 40:54.285
She was more beautiful
in her uniform, but still,

40:54.368 --> 40:55.870
quite striking, isn't she?

40:55.953 --> 40:59.248
Yes, very pleasing to the eyes, comrade.

40:59.331 --> 41:01.542
But not so pleasing to the ears,
I am afraid.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.048
As I said,

41:09.049 --> 41:10.301
unpleasant.

41:11.677 --> 41:12.928
But, I must say,

41:13.679 --> 41:15.431
I, too, am curious.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.850
The other American.

41:17.933 --> 41:19.435
What did you do with him?

41:19.977 --> 41:22.313
I don't know why,
but I imagine him on a rack,

41:22.396 --> 41:25.858
in the cold, stretched thin,

41:25.941 --> 41:27.985
birds pecking his eyeballs.

41:28.068 --> 41:29.862
Am I... close?

41:31.155 --> 41:33.866
I have heard stories of Yuri Ismaylov,

41:35.201 --> 41:37.286
the Peanut Butter Smuggler.

41:38.954 --> 41:39.914
And you…

41:41.415 --> 41:43.417
you are not the Yuri I have heard of.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.463
I am…

41:48.088 --> 41:49.006
I am not?

41:49.673 --> 41:50.633
No.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.594
No.

41:55.304 --> 41:59.308
The Yuri I was told of had a screw loose.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.227
And you…

42:02.436 --> 42:04.146
have many screws loose!

42:22.206 --> 42:24.542
I hope we have not missed the show.

42:24.625 --> 42:27.127
On the contrary, just in time.

42:39.014 --> 42:43.519
This key here will give you access
to that weapons locker.

42:44.770 --> 42:47.815
Choose any weapon you like.

42:51.402 --> 42:55.656
Work together or alone.

42:56.323 --> 42:57.616
What… what is happening?

42:58.617 --> 43:00.411
They are being told the rules.

43:02.830 --> 43:03.872
Rules for what?

43:04.456 --> 43:05.749
I could tell you...

43:06.417 --> 43:08.752
but that would spoil the fun,
now, wouldn't it?

43:13.382 --> 43:14.842
You wait for the buzzer.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.635
You WAIT.

43:18.178 --> 43:20.889
You move before the buzzer...

43:21.557 --> 43:23.350
you will be shot.

43:24.602 --> 43:25.853
Is that understood?

43:29.064 --> 43:30.524
Is that understood?

43:30.608 --> 43:32.109
Yes.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.410
I'd wish you luck

43:42.620 --> 43:43.996
but it won't help you.

58:33.718 --> 58:34.886
Stay calm.

58:35.553 --> 58:36.721
Stay close.

58:37.805 --> 58:39.224
Stick to the plan.

58:58.910 --> 58:59.953
American!

59:00.662 --> 59:02.747
I enjoy this part...

59:03.957 --> 59:06.626
When they still believe there is hope.

59:27.605 --> 59:29.607
Whatever comes out of there...

59:30.233 --> 59:31.568
hold your ground.

59:32.151 --> 59:33.695
HOLD YOUR GROUND!

59:52.463 --> 59:54.132
What is the American doing?

59:54.841 --> 59:55.675
I don't know.

59:55.758 --> 59:56.884
Find out!

1:00:25.705 --> 1:00:28.291
You move so much as an inch,
I'll kill you.

1:00:28.374 --> 1:00:29.334
What?

1:00:36.424 --> 1:00:38.009
What is this?
Some kind of sick joke?

1:00:38.092 --> 1:00:40.219
It's no joke. As I said…

1:01:43.199 --> 1:01:44.575
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1:01:45.201 --> 1:01:47.495
STAY TOGETHER YOU FOOLS!

1:01:47.995 --> 1:01:50.039
Order your men to shoot. To kill it!

1:01:50.123 --> 1:01:53.459
If I give that order,
I will be shot tomorrow and die a traitor.

1:01:53.543 --> 1:01:55.461
You want to kill me, do it!

1:02:29.912 --> 1:02:32.206
I'll kill him! I'LL KILL HIM!

1:02:32.290 --> 1:02:34.751
TOSS YOUR GUN! OVER TO ME!

1:02:38.004 --> 1:02:39.797
You, open all the doors below.

1:02:39.881 --> 1:02:40.715
You understand?

1:02:41.215 --> 1:02:42.425
OPEN THE DOORS.

1:02:42.508 --> 1:02:44.594
You open all the doors,

1:02:44.677 --> 1:02:46.804
that monster will get loose in this prison

1:02:46.888 --> 1:02:48.931
and we are all dead.

1:02:49.015 --> 1:02:51.934
I will pull this trigger! OPEN THE DOORS!

1:03:06.407 --> 1:03:09.494
They would need a battering ram
to open that door.

1:03:10.787 --> 1:03:13.498
Let the monster feed.

1:03:22.965 --> 1:03:24.383
You think I'm playing?

1:03:24.467 --> 1:03:26.719
You think I won't do it?

1:03:27.220 --> 1:03:28.971
OPEN THE DOOR!

1:03:30.556 --> 1:03:32.391
If I open those doors,

1:03:33.309 --> 1:03:35.645
I condemn not just myself,

1:03:36.187 --> 1:03:38.064
but all of my comrades to death.

1:03:39.565 --> 1:03:41.275
In good conscience, I cannot.

1:03:42.360 --> 1:03:43.486
I will not.
