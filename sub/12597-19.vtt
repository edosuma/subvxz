♪♪

00:06.440 --> 00:09.041
Look at you two,
my high school graduates!

00:09.043 --> 00:11.343
Oh. Our nest is empty.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.846
Honey, Maddie's gonna be
playing basketball with me

00:13.848 --> 00:16.115
in Beloit, just a couple
of hours away.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.884
Yeah, and I still have
all of season two
of<i> Voltage</i> to shoot here.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.353
Hey, Dad, get a graduation
picture of me and Diggie.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.988
Yeah.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.690
Hey, Diggie,
where's your
cap and gown?

00:24.692 --> 00:28.761
I... didn't
exactly graduate.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.197
Maddie:
Yeah, it's so weird.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.633
It turns out,
when you leave school
in Australia early

00:34.635 --> 00:36.735
to race home
to fight for your girl,

00:36.737 --> 00:39.571
your credits
don't exactly transfer.

00:41.075 --> 00:44.643
But... it was totally
worth it.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.613
Oh, it was totally
worth it.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.985
We're gonna be
seniors, together!

00:52.987 --> 00:57.990
Joe-Joe and Dig-Dog!
Rulin' the school...
and bein' cool!

What's up?

01:05.566 --> 01:07.066
-Willow!
-Willow!

01:07.068 --> 01:08.434
My twins!

01:09.437 --> 01:10.569
Hi.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.738
Hi.

01:14.408 --> 01:18.077
Look at us four girls.
Our last summer together.

01:18.079 --> 01:21.046
Let's just get
matching bathing suits
and go up to the lake.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.882
Uh, actually, Mom,
Willow's not really

01:23.884 --> 01:25.250
gonna be around much
this summer.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.352
Yeah, I'm leaving
for training camp tomorrow.

01:27.354 --> 01:30.722
Yeah, for Southern California
State University.

01:30.724 --> 01:31.890
I'm so proud
of you, girl.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.426
Aw. I just wish
you were coming, too.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.462
I know that going
to SCSU was your dream.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.363
Well, I mean, you know,
it's only fair.

01:38.365 --> 01:39.865
I have been
living your dream

01:39.867 --> 01:42.000
of sharing a bathroom
with Joey.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.271
We're both so lucky.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.343
I'm really gonna
miss you, Rooney.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.548
Joey. I guess it's time
to say goodbye.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.717
Goodbye.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.457
I guess
I'll see you, um...

02:05.459 --> 02:08.060
I don't know
when I'm gonna see you again.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.401
Goodbye, Rooneys.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.570
Farewell, little man.

02:31.519 --> 02:34.786
But the three of us
are still gonna get
matching bathing suits, right?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.156
Can you see it?

03:44.158 --> 03:46.525
I don't see anything
but a trip to the grocery store

03:46.527 --> 03:48.427
to get more bread.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.830
Okay, well, if Willow's face
isn't really there,

03:51.832 --> 03:53.098
then why am I seeing it?

03:53.100 --> 03:55.734
Same reason you call
those pathetic wisps of hair

03:55.736 --> 03:57.269
on your lip a mustache.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.972
You're a delusional wackadoodle.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.042
Joey...

04:04.044 --> 04:06.678
Is it possible
that saying goodbye to Willow

04:06.680 --> 04:09.615
has made you realize that
you have feelings for her?

04:09.617 --> 04:11.617
You were
an overwhelmed freshman

04:11.619 --> 04:13.518
when she first
got her crush on you.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.388
Maybe as you've matured,
so have your feelings.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.391
Mom, I feel the same way
about Willow

04:19.393 --> 04:22.361
as the day we met,
and she declared
to the whole school

04:22.363 --> 04:24.696
that I was her property.

04:24.698 --> 04:28.600
Except, now I know
that she's really smart.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.102
And super funny.

04:30.104 --> 04:33.472
And everything she was doing
was just to make me happy.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.675
I do like Willow.

04:39.647 --> 04:42.147
She could've been
my high school sweetheart.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.283
But you pushed her away
and now it's too late.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.487
Ha-ha! Classic Joey.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.358
Maybe it's not too late.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.495
Willow has to return
her cap and gown tomorrow.

04:56.497 --> 05:00.065
Go. Tell her
what you want to say.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.834
No, Mom.
She flies out tomorrow.

05:02.836 --> 05:06.071
It's not like she can be
my high school sweetheart
in the time we have left.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.241
It's impossible.

05:09.243 --> 05:11.977
Challenge accepted!

05:11.979 --> 05:13.011
What?

05:13.013 --> 05:15.080
I'm gonna help you
get the girl.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.082
Well, that's nice of--
What's your angle?

05:18.485 --> 05:22.120
Well, this could either be
a nice romantic moment
for Willow,

05:22.122 --> 05:24.323
or a humiliating catastrophe
for Joey.

05:24.325 --> 05:27.092
Either way,
I want a front row seat.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.964
-Liv?
-Yes.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.032
Can I speak to you
for a minute?

05:34.034 --> 05:35.500
Yeah, sure.
What's up, Gemma?

05:35.502 --> 05:38.670
I have major news.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.374
<i>Voltage</i> is moving
to Los Angeles!

05:43.944 --> 05:45.510
To Los Angeles?

05:47.114 --> 05:49.381
Okay. I mean, Gemma,

05:49.383 --> 05:52.117
I agreed to do<i> Voltage</i>
here in Stevens Point

05:52.119 --> 05:54.720
so I could be...
near my sister.

05:54.722 --> 05:57.656
Well, so you could
finish high school together,

05:57.658 --> 06:02.961
but now you've graduated,
so we're moving back
to Los Angeles!

06:02.963 --> 06:07.366
But, Gemma,
my whole life is here
in Stevens Point.

06:08.535 --> 06:12.003
Wait. You would seriously
give up playing SkyVolt?

06:12.005 --> 06:13.672
Well...

06:13.674 --> 06:15.607
Um...

06:16.710 --> 06:18.477
I don't know.

06:18.479 --> 06:21.646
Well, I need to know
by tomorrow.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.657
Hey!

06:32.659 --> 06:34.359
So, Mom got us
the bathing suits,

06:34.361 --> 06:36.962
and I hate to admit it,
but they're actually
really cute!

06:38.932 --> 06:41.933
<i>Voltage</i> is moving
to Los Angeles,

06:41.935 --> 06:46.104
and I have to decide
by tomorrow if I want
to go with them.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.773
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.109
Wow! That's huge!

06:52.279 --> 06:53.712
What are you gonna do?

06:53.714 --> 06:56.081
I don't know.
'Cause, I mean,

06:56.083 --> 06:57.916
I love playing SkyVolt,

06:57.918 --> 07:00.252
obviously, you know,
she's such a great a role,

07:00.254 --> 07:02.687
and she inspires little girls
all over the world.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.589
Well, yeah. I mean,
not just little girls, Liv,

07:04.591 --> 07:07.592
Joey is already making
his SkyVolt costume
for next Halloween.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.994
Yeah.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.931
I just kind of...

07:12.933 --> 07:14.900
had my heart set
on the two of us

07:14.902 --> 07:17.102
spending the next
four years together.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.537
Oh.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.540
Okay. I mean, well,
what would you do

07:21.542 --> 07:23.275
if you stayed in Wisconsin
without<i> Voltage?</i>

07:23.277 --> 07:24.709
I don't know.

07:24.711 --> 07:27.512
I mean, I guess
I could go to school.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.615
(both gasp)

07:30.617 --> 07:31.883
I could enroll
at Beloit!

07:31.885 --> 07:33.819
We could
go to college together!

07:33.821 --> 07:34.953
Maddie!

07:36.457 --> 07:38.623
(sighing)
But I mean, Liv,

07:38.625 --> 07:41.326
do you really wanna
give up<i> Voltage?</i>

07:41.328 --> 07:45.697
'Cause I have never
seen you happier
than you are right now.

07:46.834 --> 07:47.999
Yeah.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.167
Yeah.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.839
I don't know. I mean, Maddie,
how would you feel if I left?

07:55.075 --> 07:58.777
Me? Don't worry about me.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.712
You just follow your heart.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.149
Thanks, Maddie.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.684
Yeah.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.687
Just, hey,
if you do end up going,

08:08.689 --> 08:11.857
you cannot go before we do
that lake thing with Mom.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.558
I am not doing that
by myself!

08:21.869 --> 08:23.201
Hey, Willow.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.838
Put your cap and gown
in the bin.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.709
Why are you grinning?

08:30.711 --> 08:32.177
I'm not grinning.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.083
Surprise!

08:39.953 --> 08:43.421
Your man is about
to sweep you off your feet.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.627
But could you help me
out of this bin first?

08:56.803 --> 08:59.437
I finally realized
how much you mean to me.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.142
Willow, I want you to be
my high school sweetheart.

09:06.680 --> 09:11.249
Sweetheart? Seriously, Joey,
I'm on my way to the airport.

09:11.251 --> 09:15.720
So? Let's live out our entire
high school relationship...

09:15.722 --> 09:17.923
in the next five minutes.

09:21.995 --> 09:23.828
Willow Cruz...

09:25.198 --> 09:27.165
would you like
to go out with me?

09:31.505 --> 09:33.338
Willow?

09:33.340 --> 09:37.409
Oh, uh...
this is normally
where I wake up, uh...

09:40.213 --> 09:43.315
Yes! Joey Rooney,
I will go out with you.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.186
I'm so happy
for you guys!

09:48.188 --> 09:50.021
(squealing)

09:50.023 --> 09:52.857
If you break her heart,
I will break your face.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.727
That was...
not in the script, but...

09:55.729 --> 09:57.862
-Okay.
-Okay.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.702
Let's go
on our first date.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.546
A bike ride
through the park, milady?

10:14.548 --> 10:17.682
You won't even
have to pedal, little man.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.353
-I will do all the work.
-All right.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.259
You have the minions
working for you?

10:28.261 --> 10:30.362
Only the best for my girl.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.798
This looks like
a good spot.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.468
Let's stop
for a picnic.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.014
Joey...

10:49.016 --> 10:52.017
This is even better
than I pictured it.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.551
Oh, and I did picture it.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.888
The show is not over.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.035
Mom? Dad?

11:10.037 --> 11:12.404
I'd like you to meet
my girlfriend Willow.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.173
Oh, you brought me
to meet your parents?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.844
You did a wonderful job
with your son.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.614
-Meh.
-Meh, I don't...

11:26.353 --> 11:29.320
Girls playing basketball.
(scoffs)

11:29.322 --> 11:31.189
I'd rather peck out
my own eyes!

11:33.326 --> 11:35.894
Hey! You flamed-haired jerk.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.630
My girlfriend's
on the basketball team.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.732
What are you
gonna do about it?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.905
(grunting)

11:51.044 --> 11:52.377
(growls)

11:52.379 --> 11:55.580
In defeat, I become
even more powerful--

11:55.582 --> 11:57.148
Just die, Artie.

11:57.150 --> 12:01.486
(coughing)
Ohh... and so ends Artie.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.824
Oh! You fought for me.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.026
Seriously?
You swoon for him?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.994
Don't ruin this, Artie!

12:15.402 --> 12:18.036
Now, uh...
Where were we?

12:18.038 --> 12:22.006
Well, we can't be high school
sweethearts without...

12:23.210 --> 12:24.509
(gasps)

12:28.281 --> 12:31.883
Willow... will you go
to prom with me?

12:31.885 --> 12:34.753
Yes! Yes!
A thousand times yes!

12:38.592 --> 12:41.126
(toy horn honking)

12:42.929 --> 12:45.597
Did someone
order a limo?

12:48.935 --> 12:50.935
What happened
to the horse and carriage?

12:50.937 --> 12:52.971
I only had one
refrigerator box.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.539
Fine!

12:54.541 --> 12:55.640
(clears throat)

12:55.642 --> 12:57.942
After you, milady.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.440
Being your high school
sweetheart...

13:29.442 --> 13:32.243
has been
a dream come true.

13:32.245 --> 13:36.314
Thank you, for memories
I will never forget.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.049
Willow...

13:39.619 --> 13:42.720
There's one more memory
that I'd still like us
to have.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.993
Joey!

13:48.995 --> 13:50.662
My man!

13:50.664 --> 13:52.163
Yeah, that seems fair.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.068
My flight, I gotta go.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.238
(sighing)
Bye, Joey.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.077
Bye, Willow.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.619
Like I'm gonna leave
without a smooch.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.761
Yeah!

14:35.909 --> 14:39.010
Hey, I'm in the museum.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.812
You're heading
for the correct gallery.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.721
But stay alert.
Zaydock is coming
for this crystal, too.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.998
Well, I found the meterorite,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.401
but it's definitely
more than just one crystal.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.905
The Mathious crystal
comes from the same planet
as your powers.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.740
<i>Hit them</i>
<i>with a little lightning,</i>

15:08.742 --> 15:11.075
<i>and you should be able</i>
<i>to find the right one.</i>

15:11.077 --> 15:15.079
You know, how kind of like
I'm the right one for you?

15:18.218 --> 15:19.918
Are you ever gonna
give it a rest?

15:19.920 --> 15:22.787
Not until you agree
to go out with me.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.222
<i>Well...</i>

15:24.224 --> 15:27.125
I think that might have to wait
until I save the world.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.313
(grunts)

15:49.249 --> 15:50.982
<i>Careful.</i>

15:50.984 --> 15:53.918
The crystal can give
superpowers, but it can also
take them away.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.220
Then that's how
we're gonna take down Zaydock.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.224
Not likely, SkyVolt.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.327
Zaydock.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.930
I see you found my crystal.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.231
SkyVolt, get out of there!

16:08.835 --> 16:10.635
You want this crystal?

16:10.637 --> 16:13.137
It's all yours.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.681
(evil laughter)

16:23.683 --> 16:25.316
Pathetic!

16:27.253 --> 16:31.990
Let me show you
what real power is!

16:33.360 --> 16:35.593
(roaring)

16:40.633 --> 16:42.166
-SkyVolt: Oh!
-Aah!

16:50.643 --> 16:54.045
(roaring)

17:09.062 --> 17:14.298
There's nowhere you can go
that I won't find you, SkyVolt!

17:16.636 --> 17:20.805
Okay. You said
that this would rob
Zaydock of his powers.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.875
Why didn't it work?

17:25.345 --> 17:28.112
The crystal's energy
is almost completely depleted.

17:29.315 --> 17:31.416
Is there a way
to recharge it?

17:31.418 --> 17:34.585
To get it to full strength,
it would take a massive
electrical surge.

17:34.587 --> 17:38.156
All right, well, then,
stand back and let me
light this candle.

17:38.158 --> 17:41.325
It would take
a lot more power
than you can generate.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.762
What about the matrix
reactor that we found
in the ice cave?

17:44.764 --> 17:47.765
That's powerful enough,
but...

17:47.767 --> 17:50.435
it's-- it's way too dangerous.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.237
Not more dangerous
than doing nothing at all.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.475
Time to go to work.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.056
I love it when you do that.

18:12.058 --> 18:13.624
(laughs)

18:18.364 --> 18:22.700
Okay, so, I just zap
these electrodes.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.602
And that should
jump-start the reactor.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.204
Which will
recharge the crystal.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.272
If my calculations
are correct.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.975
But whatever you do,
don't touch the electrodes.

18:30.977 --> 18:34.378
If you do, your body
will take the full power
of the reactor.

18:35.582 --> 18:38.816
Touch the electrodes,
instant death. Got it.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.686
Let's do this.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.558
(grunts)

18:55.468 --> 18:57.235
It's working!

19:07.580 --> 19:09.080
Miss me?

19:10.183 --> 19:14.152
I couldn't recharge
the Mathious crystal by myself.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.121
So you waited for me
to do it for you.

19:17.123 --> 19:20.825
You make me sound
like such a bad guy.

19:20.827 --> 19:24.595
Oh, wait... I am.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.666
(screams)

19:31.437 --> 19:33.171
What's happening?

19:33.173 --> 19:36.374
I'm using the crystal
to drain you of your powers,

19:36.376 --> 19:39.010
then I will transfer them
to myself.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.511
(panting)

19:40.513 --> 19:42.346
I won't let you!

19:42.348 --> 19:46.684
The threats of the soon-to-be
dead are meaningless.

19:46.686 --> 19:51.122
But while we wait,
say goodbye to your boyfriend!

19:52.625 --> 19:53.691
(screams)

19:59.165 --> 20:01.866
A feeble miss.

20:01.868 --> 20:05.069
(roaring)

20:16.716 --> 20:19.717
Whoa. What was that?

20:19.719 --> 20:22.320
I didn't miss you, Zaydock.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.224
I hit Garrison.

20:26.226 --> 20:29.560
I used the crystal
to pass my powers to him.

20:31.164 --> 20:34.398
And left yourself defenseless.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.602
Then it's time for you to die!

20:38.671 --> 20:40.404
(screams)

20:40.406 --> 20:41.806
(screams)

20:44.510 --> 20:45.409
(both screaming)

20:45.411 --> 20:48.479
(Zaydock screaming)

20:52.952 --> 20:54.452
(groans)

20:54.454 --> 20:58.422
SkyVolt! SkyVolt! SkyVolt!
Say something, say something.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.559
Stay with me, now.

21:01.561 --> 21:02.893
(gasping)

21:02.895 --> 21:04.528
I can't.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.468
You're SkyVolt now.

21:22.282 --> 21:26.651
No!

21:34.927 --> 21:37.194
Surprise!

21:38.765 --> 21:42.600
SkyVolt is dead?

21:42.602 --> 21:45.036
No!

21:46.639 --> 21:49.006
Why would they do this?

21:49.008 --> 21:52.076
Why would you let them?

21:53.146 --> 21:55.179
You guys, it was my choice.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.816
I mean, I love
<i>Voltage</i> so much,

21:58.818 --> 22:01.585
but... I wanna be here.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.455
Maddie...

22:05.792 --> 22:08.359
Let's go to college together!

22:09.629 --> 22:10.561
Liv!

22:12.532 --> 22:13.764
Oh...

22:15.702 --> 22:19.270
This is gonna be
the best summer ever!

22:24.143 --> 22:26.844
(phone rings)

22:26.846 --> 22:29.947
Hey, Wills!
How's California?

22:29.949 --> 22:31.549
I miss you so much!

22:31.551 --> 22:35.786
Not for long, Mads.
Our starting point guard
decided to turn pro.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.521
I reminded the coach
about your reel,

22:37.523 --> 22:39.490
and they remembered
how much they liked you!

22:39.492 --> 22:41.058
What are you saying?

22:41.060 --> 22:42.727
They're gonna call
and offer you

22:42.729 --> 22:45.229
a basketball scholarship
to SCSU!

22:47.700 --> 22:49.584
Oh, my goodness!

22:49.585 --> 22:51.469
But you have to be in LA
right away for training camp.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.737
No way!

22:52.739 --> 22:55.706
No way!

22:55.708 --> 22:57.174
Willow, if you
are messing with me,

22:57.176 --> 22:58.542
I will fly to Los Angeles,

22:58.544 --> 23:01.579
and I will punch you
in the throat!

23:01.581 --> 23:03.080
No joke, Maddie.

23:03.082 --> 23:06.250
Your dream of playing
for SCSU is coming true!

23:06.252 --> 23:09.887
And FYI, I would crush you
if you try to step to me.

23:11.657 --> 23:14.925
SCSU wants me?

23:14.927 --> 23:17.528
Mom! SCSU wants me!

23:17.530 --> 23:19.897
Oh, honey,
this is so exciting!

23:19.899 --> 23:20.998
Oh!

23:21.000 --> 23:22.199
Oh, but...

23:22.201 --> 23:24.335
What about your dad?

23:26.005 --> 23:27.938
Oh! What about Liv?

23:27.940 --> 23:29.507
(phone rings)

23:29.509 --> 23:30.574
(gasps)

23:30.576 --> 23:32.676
The caller ID says "SCSU."

23:32.678 --> 23:34.211
(gasp)
That's probably Coach!

23:34.213 --> 23:35.379
(phone rings)

23:35.381 --> 23:36.447
Maddie?

23:36.449 --> 23:38.416
What are you gonna do?

23:38.418 --> 23:40.251
(phone rings)

23:41.220 --> 23:42.753
(phone rings)

23:44.724 --> 23:46.590
(phone rings)

23:46.592 --> 23:49.193
Willow:
<i>Like I'm gonna leave</i>
<i>without a smooch.</i>
