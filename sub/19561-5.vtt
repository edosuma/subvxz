02:24.259 --> 02:26.760
Do you realize how big this is?

02:26.762 --> 02:29.330
That is everything.

02:29.332 --> 02:31.532
So you're saying that
Scottie encodes messages

02:31.534 --> 02:34.101
to your agents at your company,
and you can't read them?

02:34.103 --> 02:35.569
Agents she turned.

02:35.571 --> 02:37.271
The ones she convinced
to work against me.

02:37.273 --> 02:39.573
But now I've intercepted a message,

02:39.575 --> 02:41.075
and you're gonna help me decrypt it.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.177
How? Scottie doesn't
trust me enough to tell me.

02:43.179 --> 02:44.134
I have the key book.

02:44.136 --> 02:45.713
All you need to do is get the key word.

02:45.715 --> 02:47.715
And then what she knows, we know.

02:47.717 --> 02:49.550
What if she doesn't know anything?

02:49.552 --> 02:51.352
She keeps the key word in her safe.

02:51.354 --> 02:53.687
What proof do you have that
Scottie is a sleeper agent?

02:53.689 --> 02:55.022
Because from what I can tell,

02:55.024 --> 02:56.921
she seems to be trying to do good.

02:56.923 --> 03:00.024
And I seem to be crazy, and
the world thinks I'm dead.

03:00.026 --> 03:03.161
Things aren't always how they appear.

03:03.163 --> 03:04.329
She's manipulating you.

03:04.331 --> 03:05.393
Or you are.

03:05.395 --> 03:07.198
I'm trying to get you
to do the right thing.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.534
What, lie to my mother, spy on her,

03:09.536 --> 03:11.336
hide the fact that I'm her son?

03:11.338 --> 03:12.704
Get the key word from her safe.

03:12.706 --> 03:14.172
You say that like it's easy.

03:14.174 --> 03:16.207
I will prove she's everything
I've said and worse.

03:16.209 --> 03:17.876
I don't even know where it is.

03:17.878 --> 03:21.112
The closet in her office,
in a file named "Roll Call."

03:21.114 --> 03:23.915
Okay. Okay. I'll do it.

03:23.917 --> 03:26.017
I will break into her safe.

03:26.019 --> 03:27.786
I will get this key word

03:27.788 --> 03:29.687
so you can decipher this message.

03:29.689 --> 03:31.089
But if it doesn't prove

03:31.091 --> 03:34.622
that there is something to all of this,

03:34.624 --> 03:37.428
then I'm going straight to Scottie,

03:37.430 --> 03:39.964
and I'm gonna tell her who I am.

03:43.702 --> 03:46.538
Sure, at the end, Howard hated me.

03:46.540 --> 03:49.440
He became paranoid, unstable.

03:49.442 --> 03:51.576
Secretive.

03:51.578 --> 03:53.244
I found a line item in the budget,

03:53.246 --> 03:54.879
something he hadn't told me about.

03:54.881 --> 03:56.915
Whitehall.

03:56.917 --> 03:58.950
I began investigating,

03:58.952 --> 04:01.152
and what happened is exactly
what you expect to happen

04:01.154 --> 04:03.421
when you're dealing with
someone who's paranoid.

04:03.423 --> 04:06.658
I became the enemy, the
one with the evil agenda.

04:08.530 --> 04:11.131
I went to him. I begged him to get help.

04:11.133 --> 04:14.468
But he refused.

04:14.470 --> 04:15.969
So I went to the board.

04:15.971 --> 04:19.373
I shared my concerns
about his instability,

04:19.375 --> 04:22.543
and they agreed he
had to be marginalized.

04:22.545 --> 04:24.144
Which only furthered his belief

04:24.146 --> 04:28.982
that I was out to get
him and his company.

04:28.984 --> 04:30.818
Then he went on the run and...

04:32.822 --> 04:36.293
...the accident happened.

04:36.295 --> 04:38.361
What did Whitehall turn out to be?

04:42.815 --> 04:44.916
I really shouldn't be telling you this.

04:54.362 --> 04:57.511
What's your weekly rate?

04:57.513 --> 05:00.380
Uh, no one's ever asked me that before.

05:00.382 --> 05:01.682
Well, come up with one.

05:01.684 --> 05:03.917
Tell Kat what it is, and I'll pay it.

05:03.919 --> 05:05.652
You sure that's what you want?

05:05.654 --> 05:08.489
You're a good listener,
and I've got a lot to say.

05:08.491 --> 05:11.658
Plus, you're filthy in
bed. So, yeah, I'm sure.

05:15.431 --> 05:18.932
63 refugees murdered by a
German immigration official

05:18.934 --> 05:20.868
with ties to the anti-immigration group

05:20.870 --> 05:22.069
"Germany First."

05:22.071 --> 05:25.939
The victims were exposed to sarin gas.

05:25.941 --> 05:28.709
Are you familiar with
Trans World Flight 282?

05:28.711 --> 05:31.745
Of course. It disappeared
shortly after takeoff.

05:31.747 --> 05:34.014
The wreckage was found
in the North Atlantic.

05:34.016 --> 05:36.049
The shipment of the gas was on board.

05:36.051 --> 05:37.896
That's where the sarin came from.

05:37.898 --> 05:40.087
But that was a civilian aircraft.

05:40.089 --> 05:41.622
It's a dirty little secret that

05:41.624 --> 05:43.390
the Office of Secure Transportation

05:43.392 --> 05:45.125
uses civilian aircraft to move

05:45.127 --> 05:46.794
nuclear material for the DOE,

05:46.796 --> 05:49.029
biological samples for the CDC,

05:49.031 --> 05:51.398
and, uh, certain weapons
for the Defense Department.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.900
Someone's bringing down those planes

05:52.902 --> 05:54.701
and taking what's on them.

05:54.703 --> 05:57.271
Malaysian Air 220, Air Algiers 410,

05:57.273 --> 05:58.906
and Trans World 282.

05:58.908 --> 06:00.774
Each disappeared mid-transit.

06:00.776 --> 06:01.976
No survivors.

06:01.978 --> 06:03.710
And each was secretly carrying cargo for

06:03.712 --> 06:06.079
the Office of Not So
Secure Transportation.

06:06.081 --> 06:08.749
According to the CIA,
that cargo later ended up

06:08.751 --> 06:11.451
in the hands of a terror
cell, a repressive dictator,

06:11.453 --> 06:13.453
and a radical German nationalist.

06:13.455 --> 06:15.390
So, no one survived and
nothing was recovered

06:15.392 --> 06:16.886
except for the sensitive material

06:16.888 --> 06:18.091
that nobody knew was on board?

06:18.093 --> 06:19.660
Not just anyone could
have pulled this off.

06:19.662 --> 06:21.829
Do you have any idea who
could have been behind this?

06:21.831 --> 06:24.932
We don't know who or how.
But they have to be stopped.

06:24.934 --> 06:27.134
And the CIA has actionable intel

06:27.136 --> 06:29.837
indicating another OST
shipment has been targeted.

06:29.839 --> 06:31.471
- What's the shipment?
- Top secret.

06:31.473 --> 06:34.341
Bishop could only say it's
on Borealis Flight 301.

06:34.343 --> 06:36.410
Well, it seems like the best
way to handle that would be

06:36.412 --> 06:37.778
to cancel the flight.

06:37.780 --> 06:39.613
If we do that, we lose our best chance

06:39.615 --> 06:41.849
of catching the people
behind those hijackings.

06:41.851 --> 06:44.284
Which is why I'm putting
Tom and Solomon on board.

06:44.286 --> 06:47.120
He's been preparing
your cover identities.

06:47.122 --> 06:49.957
So, what are we? Air Marshals?

06:49.959 --> 06:51.658
Not exactly.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.266
Yes, four rows down on your left.

07:08.345 --> 07:11.147
What are you doing here?

07:11.149 --> 07:13.583
I can't let you do this.

07:19.990 --> 07:21.257
Okay, what do you got?

07:21.259 --> 07:23.159
I ran a pre-flight comparison

07:23.161 --> 07:26.329
of the passengers to
the TSDB watch list.

07:26.331 --> 07:28.264
No hits. No criminal records.

07:28.266 --> 07:31.334
No one has so much as an
overdue speeding ticket.

07:31.336 --> 07:32.602
Cargo?

07:32.604 --> 07:34.170
Scanning the bags now.

07:34.172 --> 07:36.572
Nothing flammable. No
fuel or blasting caps.

07:36.574 --> 07:38.074
Nothing prohibited.

07:38.076 --> 07:40.076
- Firearms?
- Two shotguns.

07:40.078 --> 07:42.545
Based on the claim check,
they're in a gun case

07:42.547 --> 07:44.873
belonging to the gent in seat 14C.

07:44.875 --> 07:46.375
But he's got no access to it.

07:46.377 --> 07:48.117
It's a checked bag in the cargo hold.

07:48.119 --> 07:50.286
It's okay, honey.

07:50.288 --> 07:52.054
Shhh.

07:52.056 --> 07:53.556
Mommy's right here.

07:55.559 --> 07:58.261
Okay, first one to switch
seats with mom gets free drinks

07:58.263 --> 07:59.595
until the International Date Line.

07:59.597 --> 08:01.864
Or until you reach for the barf bag,

08:01.866 --> 08:03.566
whichever comes first.

08:03.568 --> 08:05.246
I'm happy to help.

08:05.248 --> 08:06.102
Perfect. Thanks.

08:09.207 --> 08:10.640
Thank you so much.

08:10.642 --> 08:13.810
Of course. I'm sorry
I didn't offer sooner.

08:13.812 --> 08:16.579
It's okay. It's okay.

08:16.581 --> 08:17.980
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

08:17.982 --> 08:20.116
Can I get a five?

08:20.118 --> 08:21.430
Yes!

08:21.432 --> 08:23.053
If you need anything, let me know.

08:23.055 --> 08:26.456
I got a little girl at home myself.

08:26.457 --> 08:27.924
All right, my friend. What'll it be?

08:27.926 --> 08:30.593
Club soda. Working on a project.

08:30.595 --> 08:32.794
Got to finish it before we land.

08:32.797 --> 08:34.263
You got it.

08:34.265 --> 08:37.232
Welcome to Borealis Flight 301,

08:37.235 --> 08:38.801
nonstop from Seattle to Beijing.

08:38.803 --> 08:41.304
Expected flight time is
11 hours and 30 minutes.

08:41.306 --> 08:44.240
I'll do the belt, but
I'm not doing the vest.

08:44.241 --> 08:45.675
Definitely not the vest.

08:45.677 --> 08:47.844
We request your attention
as Phil demonstrates

08:47.846 --> 08:50.446
the safety features of this aircraft.

08:50.448 --> 08:52.682
Ordinarily we'd begin with
a seat-belt demonstration,

08:52.684 --> 08:54.584
but Phil is so good with the vest,

08:54.586 --> 08:57.854
we're gonna go ahead
and flip the script.

09:04.863 --> 09:06.863
No weapons. No explosives.

09:06.865 --> 09:09.465
No one on board with a criminal record.

09:09.467 --> 09:10.766
Maybe the agency got it wrong

09:10.768 --> 09:12.602
about this flight being a target.

09:12.604 --> 09:14.804
Well, then we just got
an all-expense-paid trip

09:14.806 --> 09:16.505
to Beijing.

09:16.507 --> 09:18.374
You. Me.

09:18.376 --> 09:20.443
The Great Wall between us.

09:37.629 --> 09:39.102
- All right, it's 10 hours.
- Yeah.

09:39.104 --> 09:40.329
Excuse me.

09:40.331 --> 09:43.733
Uh, I-I just paid for
Wi-Fi, and it's not working.

09:48.038 --> 09:49.972
We've lost contact with Seattle center,

09:49.974 --> 09:51.908
and our transponder just went out.

09:54.077 --> 09:55.745
Fellas, we got a problem.

09:55.747 --> 09:57.713
Fellas?

09:57.715 --> 09:59.348
Okay, we got two problems.

10:01.251 --> 10:02.518
The Wi-Fi's out.

10:04.923 --> 10:06.822
- Hello?
- I can't reach Tom or Solomon.

10:06.824 --> 10:08.157
Dumont's gone dark.

10:08.159 --> 10:09.492
You said there were two problems.

10:09.494 --> 10:11.827
What's the second one?

10:11.829 --> 10:14.330
Cockpit's lost communication
with ground control.

10:14.332 --> 10:15.824
The plane vanished.

10:18.124 --> 10:19.525
It's begun.

10:22.015 --> 10:23.541
I'm piped into the FAA network.

10:23.543 --> 10:26.185
Control centers at SeaTac,
Vancouver, Anchorage...

10:26.187 --> 10:28.487
No sign of our plane. Nothing.

10:28.489 --> 10:30.389
It didn't just disappear.
There must be something.

10:30.391 --> 10:31.624
There is, but we can't see it.

10:31.626 --> 10:33.225
- They're jamming the signals.
- With what?

10:33.227 --> 10:35.227
Nothing came in with the
passengers or the luggage.

10:35.229 --> 10:37.229
Well, maybe it was already there.

10:38.466 --> 10:39.965
Franklin Dutch.

10:39.967 --> 10:42.401
Now, he's the airline
employee we knew was on board.

10:42.403 --> 10:44.236
But what we didn't
know, he's the mechanic

10:44.238 --> 10:45.471
who serviced the plane.

10:45.473 --> 10:46.663
And it gets worse.

10:46.665 --> 10:48.332
He's scheduled to work
tomorrow in Dallas.

10:48.334 --> 10:49.668
So?

10:49.670 --> 10:51.043
So if he's supposed to be in Dallas,

10:51.045 --> 10:52.745
why is he on a flight to Beijing?

11:01.467 --> 11:03.002
This plane is about to be hijacked.

11:03.004 --> 11:04.337
I thought you guys were
here to stop something

11:04.339 --> 11:05.224
like this from happening.

11:05.226 --> 11:06.692
We are, but the people
who jammed your signal

11:06.694 --> 11:08.157
have every advantage.

11:08.159 --> 11:10.427
Our only advantage is, for the
moment, we're driving this bus.

11:10.429 --> 11:12.731
Can you land the plane without
restoring communication?

11:12.733 --> 11:14.217
As long as I have a line of sight.

11:14.219 --> 11:15.935
Then get one. Fast as you can.

11:55.075 --> 11:56.475
I reviewed the maintenance records,

11:56.477 --> 11:58.077
- and everything checks out.
- Check again.

11:58.079 --> 12:00.613
Everything checks out
except for this one anomaly.

12:00.615 --> 12:02.881
The emergency oxygen generators

12:02.883 --> 12:04.984
are scheduled to be
replaced every two years.

12:04.986 --> 12:07.720
But Franklin Dutch replaced
them after only one.

12:07.722 --> 12:09.154
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:09.156 --> 12:10.723
the captain has asked me to inform you

12:10.725 --> 12:12.258
that due to a small mechanical issue,

12:12.260 --> 12:14.317
we will be making an
unscheduled landing.

12:19.834 --> 12:21.233
What's going on?

12:21.235 --> 12:23.035
It's all gonna be okay, ma'am.

12:27.508 --> 12:29.691
Take that off.

12:29.694 --> 12:31.292
I'm not gonna ask again.

12:37.118 --> 12:39.018
Cabin differential pressure is lowering.

12:39.020 --> 12:41.854
Descending through 21,000 feet.

12:50.899 --> 12:52.699
Oh!

12:52.701 --> 12:54.067
Tell me who you're with,

12:54.069 --> 12:55.569
or I will put a bullet in your belly.

12:55.571 --> 12:57.151
Hand it over.

13:01.376 --> 13:03.074
Dumont, do you copy?

13:08.249 --> 13:09.750
Masks on!

13:09.752 --> 13:12.986
Everyone! Now!

13:12.988 --> 13:14.655
You need to put yours on, as well.

13:14.657 --> 13:16.924
Go on. It's gonna be okay.

13:52.126 --> 13:53.627
What am I looking at?

13:53.629 --> 13:55.963
Five of the six ex-military passengers

13:55.965 --> 13:57.231
and their seat assignments.

13:57.233 --> 13:58.632
They didn't sit together. So?

13:58.634 --> 13:59.740
They're Navy SEALs.

13:59.743 --> 14:01.122
They trained together on Coronado.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.270
They were deployed to the
Middle East at the same time.

14:03.272 --> 14:05.939
And pretending not to
know each other. Tasty.

14:05.941 --> 14:07.975
Yeah. And if that
wasn't suspicious enough,

14:07.977 --> 14:12.246
one of them is our
mechanic, Franklin Dutch.

14:12.248 --> 14:15.215
Call DoD. Find out everything
you can on those guys.

14:40.142 --> 14:42.109
We're in.

14:56.958 --> 14:59.526
Set the course.

14:59.528 --> 15:01.862
Hey. I found this on one
of the flight attendants.

15:01.864 --> 15:03.930
Air Marshals?

15:03.932 --> 15:05.265
No.

15:05.267 --> 15:07.100
They're something else.

15:07.102 --> 15:09.136
- Where's the other guy?
- Missing.

15:09.138 --> 15:11.004
Find him.

15:47.666 --> 15:49.232
We're back on radar.

15:49.234 --> 15:50.834
The flight attendant found the jammer.

15:50.836 --> 15:52.969
How much longer to the LZ?

15:52.971 --> 15:55.171
Six minutes.

15:55.173 --> 15:59.075
Dumont, do you hear me?

15:59.077 --> 16:01.294
Loud and clear, buddy.

16:01.297 --> 16:03.513
- Welcome back.
- I found the jammer.

16:03.515 --> 16:05.915
- I'm in the cargo hold.
- What's your status?

16:05.917 --> 16:07.183
Hijackers are in charge.

16:07.185 --> 16:08.852
I count four. Mercs. Well-trained.

16:08.854 --> 16:10.787
- And Solomon?
- Unclear.

16:10.789 --> 16:12.522
He's down.

16:12.524 --> 16:14.324
You said there were
two shotguns on board.

16:14.326 --> 16:16.132
I wouldn't mind knowing where those are.

16:16.135 --> 16:19.229
- On it.
- The DoD have anything?

16:19.231 --> 16:22.365
The intel focused mainly
on this guy... Carter Cane.

16:22.367 --> 16:24.267
He's a former Spec Ops commander

16:24.269 --> 16:26.336
and a specialist at
seizing assets in war zones.

16:26.338 --> 16:28.471
The rest all just served under him.

16:28.473 --> 16:31.441
- Any time, Dumont.
- Working on it.

16:31.443 --> 16:34.344
They completed one last
sanctioned mission in Iraq

16:34.346 --> 16:36.780
before going AWOL indefinitely.

16:36.782 --> 16:40.216
Since then, DoD attributes
at least a half a dozen heists

16:40.218 --> 16:43.019
to their crew, from
Monets stolen in Munich

16:43.021 --> 16:46.323
to the theft of a classified
mortar prototype in Haifa.

16:46.325 --> 16:47.857
High-risk thefts... Like stealing

16:47.859 --> 16:49.459
what the OST hides on planes.

16:49.461 --> 16:52.362
The question is, what
are they after this time?

16:52.364 --> 16:54.130
Looking, looking...

16:54.132 --> 16:55.011
There.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.333
Crate 217.

16:56.335 --> 16:58.902
Black gun case.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.076
Quaid, our mystery guest...

17:06.078 --> 17:07.577
What's taking so long to locate him?

17:07.579 --> 17:09.546
I'm doing a sweep down below.

17:26.396 --> 17:28.464
You should've listened to me.

17:40.945 --> 17:44.147
- Package secure.
- 90 seconds to the LZ.

18:12.309 --> 18:15.111
Quaid, status report.

18:15.113 --> 18:17.947
One down. Four to go.

18:17.949 --> 18:19.449
Good luck with that.

18:19.451 --> 18:21.785
We're gonna be getting
off at the next stop.

18:21.787 --> 18:23.953
Enjoy the ride.

18:23.955 --> 18:26.089
Lock the hatch.

18:31.796 --> 18:33.154
In 10, Tasker.

18:38.646 --> 18:40.036
There's no time.

19:03.427 --> 19:04.828
The cabin's depressurized.

19:04.830 --> 19:06.062
Why? What's happening?

19:31.422 --> 19:34.224
Hey. Hey!

19:34.226 --> 19:36.559
Come on. Wake up. Hey. Hey.

19:36.561 --> 19:38.127
Tom, no time.

19:38.129 --> 19:40.196
You need to get on the controls.

19:40.198 --> 19:42.999
Oh, God. Are you serious?

19:43.001 --> 19:45.201
Okay.

19:45.203 --> 19:47.036
Okay, Dumont, how do I land this thing?

19:47.038 --> 19:48.671
You need to disengage the autopilot

19:48.673 --> 19:50.139
and level the plane.

19:50.141 --> 19:51.875
Okay. Great. How do I do that?

19:51.877 --> 19:54.442
Quickly. There are two
switches on the main console

19:54.445 --> 19:56.211
in front of you.

19:56.214 --> 19:57.714
Okay, done. Next?

19:57.716 --> 19:59.816
Grab the yoke and
slowly pull back on it.

19:59.818 --> 20:01.818
- Right.
- Nice and steady.

20:01.820 --> 20:02.986
It won't budge.

20:02.988 --> 20:04.420
They must be going too fast.

20:04.422 --> 20:05.855
Solutions, please. Not problems.

20:05.857 --> 20:07.824
- I'm trying.
- Extend the flaps.

20:07.826 --> 20:10.193
- What?
- White knob on the right.

20:10.195 --> 20:12.495
Pull it down.

20:12.497 --> 20:13.830
Okay, what else?

20:13.832 --> 20:15.999
- Now the speed brakes.
- What is that?

20:16.001 --> 20:18.968
Uh... black lever right next to you.

20:20.338 --> 20:21.604
Okay, it's not working.

20:21.606 --> 20:23.940
Pull up!

20:26.544 --> 20:29.379
Oh, God.

20:30.882 --> 20:33.049
Tom?

20:35.753 --> 20:38.221
Yeah, I'm alive.

20:38.223 --> 20:40.790
Altitude's stable.

20:42.794 --> 20:45.128
What happened?

20:45.130 --> 20:46.462
Why don't you land this thing

20:46.464 --> 20:48.205
and I'll tell you all about it?

21:02.679 --> 21:05.183
I thought I'd lost you.

21:05.185 --> 21:06.584
Any word on Solomon?

21:06.586 --> 21:08.719
I've ordered a full
search-and-rescue op,

21:08.721 --> 21:09.883
dedicated satellite sweeps.

21:09.886 --> 21:11.255
Whatever it takes to bring him home.

21:11.257 --> 21:12.590
What is this all about?

21:12.592 --> 21:15.259
That's what we're about to find out.

21:15.261 --> 21:16.928
Daniel Bishop, you know Tom Keen.

21:16.930 --> 21:19.197
He and Matias Solomon
were on the plane together.

21:19.199 --> 21:21.232
I want to thank you for saving the lives

21:21.234 --> 21:22.934
of everyone on board.

21:22.936 --> 21:24.202
Almost everyone.

21:24.204 --> 21:26.270
Yeah. I heard an agent's MIA.

21:26.272 --> 21:27.772
We've identified the strike team,

21:27.774 --> 21:30.342
but two others are unaccounted for.

21:30.345 --> 21:31.943
Aldon Braddock and Jennifer Lin.

21:31.945 --> 21:34.011
I assume that's not a coincidence.

21:34.013 --> 21:36.614
The package wasn't a
package. It was a person.

21:36.616 --> 21:39.948
Yes. Jennifer Lin is
a deep-cover asset.

21:39.951 --> 21:42.285
Chinese-American. No
one could know about her

21:42.288 --> 21:44.253
because of her mission in Macao.

21:44.256 --> 21:46.448
What mission? Have you heard of Lu Tao?

21:46.450 --> 21:47.816
Chinese crime lord.

21:47.818 --> 21:49.484
His network dominates
the Asian black market

21:49.486 --> 21:51.953
in everything from arms
dealing to human trafficking.

21:51.955 --> 21:55.156
Lin was on her way to become
Lu Tao's personal translator.

21:55.158 --> 21:58.827
For the first time, we were
gonna have inside access.

21:58.829 --> 22:00.795
Why did Cane and his crew target her?

22:00.797 --> 22:02.797
I have no idea why they took her.

22:02.799 --> 22:04.799
And Aldon Braddock? Ex-Army Ranger.

22:04.801 --> 22:07.836
Top marks, decorated,
honorable discharge.

22:07.838 --> 22:09.337
How does he fit in?

22:09.339 --> 22:11.539
Your guess is as good as mine.

22:11.541 --> 22:14.476
_

22:26.790 --> 22:28.957
What is this place?

22:28.959 --> 22:30.258
Oh!

22:38.435 --> 22:39.667
Why are you doing this?

22:39.669 --> 22:40.935
Shut up.

22:40.937 --> 22:43.037
The plane... All those people...

22:43.039 --> 22:45.241
I'm telling you, say nothing.

22:45.244 --> 22:46.875
Where are you going?

22:46.877 --> 22:48.309
What do you want from me?

22:48.311 --> 22:50.645
Don't leave me here!

22:53.549 --> 22:54.883
Oh. Can I help you?

22:54.885 --> 22:56.518
Hey, Kat. Scottie asked me to bring

22:56.520 --> 22:58.720
in the latest on the search
and rescue on Solomon.

22:58.722 --> 23:00.054
Any news?

23:00.056 --> 23:01.122
Nothing yet.

23:01.124 --> 23:02.624
I-I can, um, give it to her

23:02.626 --> 23:03.992
- when she gets back.
- You know what? That's okay.

23:03.994 --> 23:05.493
She asked me to drop it on her desk.

23:05.495 --> 23:07.228
And I figure I'm still
low man on the totem pole,

23:07.230 --> 23:09.063
so I should probably do
exactly what she says.

23:09.065 --> 23:12.000
Smart man.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.569
_

23:59.014 --> 24:01.549
...not just the phone. You
need him to sign an NDA.

24:01.551 --> 24:04.252
An NDA? Trevor?

24:04.254 --> 24:06.955
- I tell him things.
- What kind of things?

24:06.957 --> 24:09.057
Things that I don't want disclosed.

24:09.059 --> 24:10.458
What?

24:10.460 --> 24:12.360
Well, it's just, I saw Tom Keen earlier,

24:12.362 --> 24:15.129
and he said that he was going
to leave a report on your desk.

24:15.131 --> 24:17.031
Find Tom, ask him what he did with it.

24:17.033 --> 24:18.299
Get the NDA from legal.

24:18.301 --> 24:21.169
And, remember, it has to be notarized.

24:25.843 --> 24:29.593
_

24:51.502 --> 24:53.335
Falcon.

24:53.338 --> 24:54.671
Well done.

24:54.674 --> 24:57.341
We're one step closer to the truth.

24:59.489 --> 25:01.156
How is Agnes?

25:01.158 --> 25:02.491
Agnes?

25:02.493 --> 25:05.194
She must be almost, what, 1 by now?

25:05.196 --> 25:07.730
She's 11 months.

25:07.732 --> 25:10.032
She's everything.

25:10.034 --> 25:12.735
I miss her.

25:12.737 --> 25:16.071
I hope to meet her someday.

25:16.073 --> 25:18.841
The letters give us numbers, see?

25:18.843 --> 25:21.377
Now all we need is the key book.

25:32.155 --> 25:36.358
This... This is the key...
The key book is a comic?

25:36.360 --> 25:37.926
Book ciphers have...

25:37.928 --> 25:39.895
Have been used for hundreds of years.

25:39.897 --> 25:42.531
Book ciphers, not comic-book ciphers.

25:42.533 --> 25:44.233
Some have never been
successfully cracked

25:44.235 --> 25:47.069
because nobody knew the right book.

25:47.071 --> 25:53.175
Each set of three
numbers gives us a page...

25:55.046 --> 25:57.946
...a panel,

25:57.948 --> 26:02.084
and a word within the panel.

26:02.086 --> 26:04.687
You know, she kept
something else in that safe.

26:07.425 --> 26:10.559
Mm.

26:10.561 --> 26:13.362
Something's not right.
It's always worked before.

26:13.364 --> 26:14.630
Are you sure it's "falcon"?

26:14.632 --> 26:17.599
It was a child's handprint.

26:17.601 --> 26:19.935
The keyword?

26:19.937 --> 26:21.270
It was my handprint.

26:21.272 --> 26:22.771
You must have made a mistake.

26:22.773 --> 26:24.873
Yeah, I did make a mistake.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.875
Believing in you. Give me this.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.815
There's no conspiracy.

26:32.817 --> 26:34.383
She's not a sleeper agent, all right?

26:34.385 --> 26:37.319
And there's no message in a comic book.

26:37.321 --> 26:38.887
Where are you going?

26:38.889 --> 26:41.390
I came here for proof,
okay, and this isn't it.

26:41.392 --> 26:43.392
So I'm gonna go tell her who I am.

26:43.394 --> 26:44.893
You'll get us both killed.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.628
Step aside.

26:46.630 --> 26:48.163
Step...

26:48.165 --> 26:50.199
aside.

26:59.609 --> 27:02.044
Operator 48, this is Bluebeard, over.

27:04.515 --> 27:06.648
Operator 48, this is Bluebeard.

27:06.650 --> 27:08.984
Do you copy?

27:19.163 --> 27:21.330
Where's the landing zone?

27:21.332 --> 27:24.967
Where were you supposed to
meet up with your compadres?

27:24.969 --> 27:26.802
Okay, let me lay this out for you.

27:26.804 --> 27:29.138
Broken femur. Sun's going down.

27:29.140 --> 27:30.539
Out of radio contact.

27:30.541 --> 27:32.441
Oh.

27:32.443 --> 27:35.377
And you're naked.

27:35.379 --> 27:38.514
You will be wolf meat by morning.

27:38.516 --> 27:39.848
Unless we get to the LZ.

27:39.850 --> 27:41.650
So...

27:43.954 --> 27:46.288
Where are your pals?

28:20.490 --> 28:23.325
KR-20.

28:23.327 --> 28:27.095
The blueprints.

28:27.097 --> 28:29.231
I don't know.

28:29.233 --> 28:31.900
KR-20, I don't know what that is.

28:35.032 --> 28:37.339
I'm told you do.

28:52.698 --> 28:55.499
Every winter, when I was a boy,

28:55.501 --> 28:58.368
my mother had the most
terrible choice to make.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.137
Should she put food on the table

29:00.139 --> 29:03.250
or turn on the heat?

29:03.253 --> 29:04.875
'Cause she couldn't afford to do both.

29:04.877 --> 29:08.011
Well, mostly she fed us,

29:08.013 --> 29:10.147
and we would huddle our way through.

29:10.149 --> 29:12.516
Until the winter of '93.

29:12.518 --> 29:16.486
It was so damn cold.

29:16.488 --> 29:19.189
Hand to God, I got frostbite.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.858
In my apartment.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.826
Lost two toes.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.561
After that, Mother
swore she'd never choose

29:24.563 --> 29:26.330
between food and heat again.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.831
So...

29:32.337 --> 29:38.041
She took out a loan...

29:38.043 --> 29:40.344
from the neighborhood loan shark.

29:40.346 --> 29:43.580
Lance Wilbanks.

29:43.582 --> 29:46.550
36% interest.

29:46.553 --> 29:48.641
That first month, our bellies were full

29:48.643 --> 29:51.655
and our feet were warm.

29:51.657 --> 29:54.424
And then the payments came due.

29:54.426 --> 29:59.863
A month later, there
was no food or heat.

29:59.865 --> 30:02.106
And Mama prayed for a miracle.

30:02.109 --> 30:03.400
She prayed.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.069
And she prayed.

30:06.071 --> 30:10.007
But that woman, she could pray.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.536
And I'll be damned if
the clouds didn't part,

30:12.539 --> 30:15.092
and the hand of God didn't reach down

30:15.095 --> 30:18.430
and deliver that fine woman
from her misery in the form

30:18.433 --> 30:25.338
of the oh-so-timely
demise of Lance Wilbanks.

30:25.340 --> 30:26.840
One bullet to the temple.

30:26.842 --> 30:29.843
His bankroll taken. Crime never solved.

30:29.845 --> 30:32.445
And my mother never had to
make that terrible choice again.

30:36.657 --> 30:39.652
I was 13.

30:39.654 --> 30:43.089
And Wilbanks was the first man

30:43.091 --> 30:45.625
that I ever killed.

30:47.361 --> 30:50.830
Point being...

30:50.832 --> 30:53.666
I hate being cold.

30:53.668 --> 30:57.036
So I can either head
off into the wilderness

30:57.038 --> 31:00.139
and seek shelter on my own,

31:00.141 --> 31:04.777
or you can tell me where the LZ is

31:04.779 --> 31:06.846
and we can both thaw out.

31:11.452 --> 31:12.685
All right, suit yourself.

31:14.955 --> 31:18.958
There's an abandoned mill.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.395
I have coordinates.

31:22.397 --> 31:24.464
All right.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.900
What are they?

31:26.902 --> 31:30.537
Oh, it turns out the
radio does work, after all.

31:35.509 --> 31:37.391
- Can I talk to you?
- Of course.

31:37.394 --> 31:39.895
Alone?

31:50.140 --> 31:52.892
What?

31:52.894 --> 31:55.562
We got him. Solomon. We got Solomon.

31:55.564 --> 31:57.096
British Columbia, outside Osoyoos.

31:57.098 --> 31:58.431
He radioed coordinates.

31:58.433 --> 31:59.233
Find Nez.

31:59.236 --> 32:01.668
You're wheels up in 30 minutes.

32:08.042 --> 32:09.509
This isn't working.

32:09.511 --> 32:11.044
She won't give us KR-20.

32:11.046 --> 32:12.445
I told you we shouldn't
have listened to him.

32:12.447 --> 32:15.615
You vetted my sources.
That girl's lying to you.

32:15.617 --> 32:17.450
- Let me talk to her.
- She's not lying.

32:17.452 --> 32:19.929
She doesn't know. We
can't waste any more time.

32:19.932 --> 32:21.431
Signal jammer was broken.

32:21.434 --> 32:23.388
Ground control was
able to track the plane.

32:23.391 --> 32:26.192
If they're smart, they've already
dispatched search and rescue.

32:26.194 --> 32:29.796
Find Dutch. Get him to pack up.

32:29.798 --> 32:32.133
She's your mess.

32:32.136 --> 32:33.336
Clean it up.

32:47.206 --> 32:49.674
Braddock!

32:52.445 --> 32:55.013
Braddock?

33:11.331 --> 33:14.065
- Jumping out of an airplane. Really?
- Child's play.

33:14.067 --> 33:16.701
You just can't die, can you?

33:16.703 --> 33:18.636
Well, now that you mention it...

33:18.638 --> 33:19.782
No.

33:19.785 --> 33:21.873
So, what are we looking at?

33:21.875 --> 33:23.174
We're looking at a
three or four-man team

33:23.176 --> 33:24.576
in a machine shop two miles from here.

33:24.578 --> 33:26.244
They got a hostage.

33:26.246 --> 33:27.645
And my new friend back there says

33:27.647 --> 33:29.814
she's got intel on the KR-20.

33:29.816 --> 33:31.115
That's a mobile rocket system

33:31.118 --> 33:32.851
that terrorist groups have been
trying to get their hands on

33:32.853 --> 33:34.185
for a few years now.

33:34.187 --> 33:35.754
It's Dumont.

33:35.756 --> 33:37.756
Aldon Braddock, the one-off.

33:37.758 --> 33:40.191
Everyone in the crew was in
the same unit except Braddock.

33:40.193 --> 33:42.694
- So how does he fit in?
- Through Jennifer Lin.

33:42.696 --> 33:44.662
Three years ago, she was
attached to his Ranger unit.

33:44.664 --> 33:45.830
Those two new each other.

33:45.832 --> 33:47.265
Knew each other how?

33:47.267 --> 33:49.362
It looks like they had an
affair, because after it ended,

33:49.364 --> 33:52.270
she had a restraining order against him.

33:52.272 --> 33:53.838
This doesn't make sense.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.874
Love never does, my friend.

34:04.216 --> 34:07.085
That's Franklin Dutch.

34:20.065 --> 34:22.833
We got another one down.

34:35.447 --> 34:37.982
Carter Cane. That leaves
Jennifer and Braddock.

34:37.984 --> 34:40.485
Son of a bitch. Where are they?

34:41.864 --> 34:43.888
Sorry it took so long to
get you away from them.

34:43.889 --> 34:46.623
I just had to find
the right opportunity.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.159
Are you out of your mind?!

34:48.161 --> 34:50.995
Hijacking a plane?
Kidnapping me mid-flight?

34:50.996 --> 34:52.464
They did it because you told them

34:52.466 --> 34:53.998
I knew about KR-whatever.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.733
Yes. Okay? Yes. Exactly.

34:55.735 --> 34:57.268
I knew that they would
do whatever it takes

34:57.270 --> 34:59.671
to get their hands on the
blueprints for the KR-20.

34:59.673 --> 35:01.739
- Did the plane crash?
- So I told them you had them.

35:01.741 --> 35:04.509
- Did all those people die?
- I tried to talk to you.

35:04.511 --> 35:08.947
I did everything that I could
to get you to listen to me.

35:08.949 --> 35:12.817
If something terrible
did happen to that plane,

35:12.819 --> 35:14.786
I don't blame you for that.

35:14.788 --> 35:15.920
Me?

35:15.922 --> 35:17.121
For pushing me away,

35:17.123 --> 35:19.257
for getting the restraining order.

35:19.259 --> 35:21.659
You don't see it, but
I did all that for you.

35:21.661 --> 35:24.496
For us.

35:38.945 --> 35:40.478
- A distress beacon?
- On a boat, yes.

35:40.480 --> 35:41.880
A call for help.

35:41.882 --> 35:43.882
It pings a government
search-and-rescue system.

35:43.884 --> 35:45.216
And?

35:45.218 --> 35:47.285
This ping came from a boat near Seattle,

35:47.287 --> 35:49.320
registered by Colin Hordwell.

35:49.322 --> 35:51.689
And unless he's got an evil twin,

35:51.691 --> 35:55.860
he's using it as an
alias for Aldon Braddock.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.228
Contact Nez. Tell her we know

35:57.230 --> 36:00.098
where Braddock and Jennifer Lin are.

36:00.100 --> 36:02.400
So, I got it all figured out.

36:02.402 --> 36:05.216
There's this town on the Skeena River.

36:05.219 --> 36:07.004
We can get a cabin,

36:07.007 --> 36:10.642
get licensed to run fishing expeditions.

36:10.644 --> 36:11.743
How's that sound?

36:31.421 --> 36:32.987
Jennifer!

36:37.292 --> 36:40.128
It's okay! I know you're confused!

36:50.939 --> 36:54.409
Come out! We can talk about it!

36:54.411 --> 36:55.910
Jennifer!

37:15.365 --> 37:17.732
Aah! Aah!

37:22.271 --> 37:23.971
Jennifer!

37:29.888 --> 37:32.113
Get away from me!

37:33.854 --> 37:36.089
Don't you understand?
That's never gonna happen.

37:36.091 --> 37:37.991
You're sick. You need help.

37:37.993 --> 37:39.826
No. All I need is you.

37:39.828 --> 37:41.027
No. You messed up everything.

37:41.029 --> 37:42.428
No. Don't.

37:42.430 --> 37:43.796
Nobody had to die.

37:43.798 --> 37:46.966
Nobody had to get hurt.

37:46.968 --> 37:49.068
We could have been so happy.

37:51.640 --> 37:53.540
I got him. Don't move.

38:29.711 --> 38:30.910
Oh, hey.

38:30.912 --> 38:32.045
Hi.

38:32.047 --> 38:33.846
What's all this?

38:33.848 --> 38:36.082
Burner phone.

38:36.084 --> 38:38.318
Retainer agreement.

38:38.320 --> 38:39.319
NDA.

38:39.321 --> 38:40.320
NDA?

38:40.322 --> 38:42.155
Nondisclosure agreement.

38:42.157 --> 38:43.923
What? You're kidding, right?

38:43.925 --> 38:45.825
You're to have it charged at all times.

38:45.827 --> 38:47.193
It is to be with you between the hours

38:47.195 --> 38:48.861
of 11:00 a.m. and midnight.

38:48.863 --> 38:50.530
Messages left on the
phone are to be returned

38:50.532 --> 38:52.498
within 15 minutes or you're in breach.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.000
Now I know you're kidding.

38:54.002 --> 38:56.069
Welcome to my life.

38:59.907 --> 39:02.241
Is this a bad time?

39:03.744 --> 39:06.279
You made visual contact.

39:06.281 --> 39:09.215
So it's confirmed?

39:09.217 --> 39:12.185
No, no. I'm... I'm still here.

39:12.187 --> 39:15.588
Yeah, you have my go
to move on the target.

39:18.892 --> 39:21.094
Everything okay?

39:21.096 --> 39:23.296
No, it's... it's not.

39:23.298 --> 39:25.698
It's not even close to being okay.

39:25.700 --> 39:28.368
Maybe I can, uh...

39:28.370 --> 39:31.037
make things a little easier.

39:31.039 --> 39:33.439
I doubt that very much.

39:36.143 --> 39:38.211
I misjudged you.

39:38.213 --> 39:40.880
S-Somebody...

39:40.882 --> 39:44.217
Somebody told me that
you weren't to be trusted.

39:44.219 --> 39:47.754
And because of that,
I haven't really been...

39:47.756 --> 39:50.256
myself.

39:52.559 --> 39:55.061
I haven't really been honest...

39:58.999 --> 40:01.734
...with you.

40:01.736 --> 40:04.237
Honest with me about what?

40:08.308 --> 40:11.244
Um...

40:11.246 --> 40:14.914
Tom.

40:14.916 --> 40:17.250
It's Liz.

40:17.252 --> 40:18.985
We're really struggling.

40:18.987 --> 40:20.586
I didn't even want to bring it up.

40:20.588 --> 40:22.755
I don't want to burden you.

40:22.757 --> 40:25.024
Nothing's more important than family.

40:25.026 --> 40:26.759
If you need time, take it.

40:26.761 --> 40:28.127
Marriage is hard.

40:28.129 --> 40:30.963
Mine certainly is.

40:30.965 --> 40:32.999
Was.

40:33.001 --> 40:37.036
My marriage was difficult.

40:38.605 --> 40:43.176
If only I could see Howard again.

40:43.178 --> 40:46.379
We'd have so much to talk about.

41:10.205 --> 41:13.539
_

41:20.982 --> 41:24.016
_

41:51.880 --> 41:54.113
