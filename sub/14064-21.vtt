Previously on Boston Legal.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.528
It's time to start dating again.

00:05.638 --> 00:07.902
- Shirley's told me so much about you.
- Giggity-giggity.

00:08.007 --> 00:10.408
I met someone else,
and the night took a whole other twist.

00:10.510 --> 00:13.070
- I have been arrested.
- What for?

00:13.179 --> 00:15.443
- Impersonating a police officer.
- I'm such a loser.

00:15.548 --> 00:18.176
I want you to find out
if my daughter is using drugs again.

00:18.284 --> 00:20.514
- What time do you get off work?
- I get off at 7:00.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.851
I would appreciate your protecting
my relationship with her if you can.

00:23.957 --> 00:24.981
What about my relationship?

00:25.091 --> 00:27.559
- Night terrors?
- I haven't had them in years.

00:27.660 --> 00:30.891
- I'm afraid of clowns.
- Something screwy going on up there.

00:38.405 --> 00:43.536
And over 40% of the groundwater
in the United States- 40%-

00:43.643 --> 00:46.942
is contaminated by industrial,
agricultural, household pollution.

00:47.047 --> 00:51.381
Over the last five years,
hundreds of thousands of blood tests...

00:51.484 --> 00:53.145
given to Massachusetts children...

00:53.253 --> 00:56.381
have shown elevated levels
oflead in their blood.

00:56.489 --> 00:59.390
Yet what is our biggest fear?
The dirty bomb, not the dirty water-

00:59.492 --> 01:04.896
Objection. Mr. Shore is introducing evidence
that was never presented at trial.

01:04.998 --> 01:08.126
Nonsense, Your Honor.
I refer you to Plaintiff's Exhibit Number Apple.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.725
- I beg your pardon?
- Apple trash can is picked from God.

01:12.772 --> 01:14.171
- Huh?
- Mr. Shore-

01:14.274 --> 01:16.799
Not that you're 60,
but classic electrons are free.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.743
Objection, uh, I think.

01:19.846 --> 01:23.304
Mr. Shore, you have a notorious history
of courtroom theatrics.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.817
If your aim is to force a mistrial,
you will be disappointed.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.822
Pillow pants join forces
over embargo pylons.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.922
You aren't sailing past honor
for the liking of a room.

01:37.697 --> 01:39.927
These questions are birthday basements.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.934
To end the blue radish
is the upside of luxury...

01:43.036 --> 01:46.267
and sparking a good lizard
can only make tears fall in hindsight.

01:46.372 --> 01:48.169
Puddles do not ask for why not.

01:49.476 --> 01:53.173
It is cheese, breath and wind.

01:54.647 --> 01:56.615
It is cheese.

02:18.171 --> 02:20.139
What?

02:51.137 --> 02:53.037
Word salad.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.539
It's the phenomenon
of confused language...

02:55.642 --> 02:59.840
seen most often in patients with schizophrenia
or another underlying psychosis.

02:59.946 --> 03:04.349
Now, similar symptoms may also result
from head trauma or an invasive tumor.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.743
- And I have-
- None of those.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.448
According to the M. R. I.,
your brain looks normal.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.617
I wouldn't know if it didn't.

03:13.726 --> 03:17.457
Also, you don't display any symptoms
of psychosis or schizophrenia.

03:17.564 --> 03:19.691
Well, we hardly know each other.

03:19.799 --> 03:23.030
The truth of it is, the brain
is very much a mystery.

03:23.136 --> 03:28.096
It's theoretically possible that these symptoms
might be brought on by acute anxiety.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.870
How are things at home?

03:31.978 --> 03:33.809
I live alone in a hotel.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.815
I see.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.817
Word salad?

03:39.919 --> 03:43.650
It's talking in unintelligible gibberish,
brought on by anxiety.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.656
Gave me some pills.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.783
Ooh. Let me see.

03:49.562 --> 03:53.157
Blue. I like blue.
Something to wash it down with?

03:53.266 --> 03:57.066
I don't know.
I rather value my melancholy.

03:57.170 --> 04:00.901
Used to be a personality trait
one was allowed to have...

04:01.007 --> 04:03.908
like Abraham Lincoln or Lord Byron.

04:04.010 --> 04:08.140
Now one is required to grin
and say things like "great. "

04:08.248 --> 04:11.012
You don't need pills.
You need to stop helping people.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.244
What do you mean?

04:13.353 --> 04:16.413
Those old people who were being fleeced
by their conservator, the smoker...

04:16.522 --> 04:18.752
that gloomy little girl
that wouldn't smile.

04:18.858 --> 04:21.088
- You try to help those people. And don't deny it.
- I don't.

04:21.194 --> 04:24.857
But what the hell does that have to do
with this episode of word salad?

04:24.964 --> 04:28.491
Well, Alan, the human mind is like a bucket.
It can only hold so much.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.661
You see all that suffering going on
around you, and you get involved.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.934
It fills up your bucket,
and soon it's overflowing.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.767
The doctor recommended
I take a few days off.

04:40.146 --> 04:44.173
I know just the thing.
I'm gonna take you to my spa.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.684
I'm gonna empty your bucket.

04:57.897 --> 04:59.888
I live at 147 Edgar Street.

04:59.999 --> 05:01.899
And I'm at 149 Edgar Street.

05:02.001 --> 05:03.969
- We babysit each other's kids.
- We go to Cost Buy together.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.561
- Split everything.
- Toilet paper, paper towels.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.800
- Jumbo ketchup two-pack.
- I have the lawn mower.

05:08.908 --> 05:12.810
- Hedge clipper, weed whacker.
- And we both share Ray.

05:12.912 --> 05:15.403
There's just one problem
with this arrangement.

05:15.515 --> 05:18.313
- It's completely illegal.
- Afraid so.

05:18.418 --> 05:21.046
Well, for six years, everything was fine.
But people start to talk.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.646
And one day we came home with the children,
and Ray was being handcuffed and arrested.

05:24.757 --> 05:28.818
Right in front of 147. We've done
nothing wrong. There's no victim here.

05:28.928 --> 05:32.864
To the contrary, in this chaotic world
we live in, where there is no stability...

05:32.965 --> 05:36.196
we have found a way to raise a family
in a cooperative, loving way.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.827
And now we're being punished for it.
I think that's wrong.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.667
- We all do.
- Especially me.

05:42.141 --> 05:45.838
Guys, the law on polygamy has
been settled for a long time.

05:45.945 --> 05:49.847
- So? It's time for a change.
- We are very committed to this.

05:49.949 --> 05:51.917
I know I am.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.009
Right.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.521
- Chris Mott, Shirley Schmidt.
- How do you do?

06:02.628 --> 06:05.188
- Paul Lewiston.
- Hello.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.198
Chris is an old buddy
of mine from Annapolis.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.461
Right now he's founder and C. E. O.
of Alcove Games.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.265
Last quarter they posted
a profit of 502 mil.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.533
Very impressive.
How can we help you?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.699
- A wrongful death suit.
- Completely frivolous.

06:16.809 --> 06:19.937
Filed by the mother of a kid who died
while playing their latest video game.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.707
- He died.
- Heart attack.

06:21.814 --> 06:23.805
How is that even possible?

06:23.916 --> 06:26.214
He played the game
for nearly two days.

06:26.319 --> 06:30.153
- Didn't eat, didn't drink. His heart stopped.
- The game is called Hellbourne.

06:30.256 --> 06:33.885
You start out as a ghost
fighting your way out of hell.

06:33.993 --> 06:37.622
When you surface, you need to track down
your lost soul in order to become human again.

06:37.730 --> 06:41.063
- Sounds like a typical day around here.
- Like I said, it's frivolous.

06:41.167 --> 06:45.297
Nojury's gonna hold a company responsible
because a parent let a kid play a game for two days.

06:45.405 --> 06:49.739
But there's a glitch.
I need this to go away before it goes to trial.

06:49.842 --> 06:53.471
We've got a sequel coming out next month,
and bad press could kill us.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.479
Shouldn't be a problem.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.175
I'm thinking we can get this
kicked on summary judgment.

06:58.284 --> 07:01.412
Five hundred and two million.
You've landed your first whale.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.489
- Nice work, partner.
- Thank you.

07:03.589 --> 07:06.649
Paul, how's your daughter doing in rehab?

07:06.759 --> 07:09.592
Rachel's doing just fine, Brad.

07:09.695 --> 07:13.187
- Tell her I said hello?
- I will.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.952
I never took you
for a spa person, Denny.

07:35.054 --> 07:36.954
Oh, man. I love it.

07:37.056 --> 07:40.457
Being touched and caressed and-

07:40.560 --> 07:42.460
Milked.

07:42.562 --> 07:45.360
Thank you, Digna.
Mmm.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.624
Are you still spooked
by this word jumble thing?

07:49.735 --> 07:51.703
Word salad. Yes.

07:51.804 --> 07:56.138
- Happens to me all the time. You get used to it.
- I don't want to get used to it.

07:56.242 --> 07:59.405
It was extremely upsetting
to be speaking...

07:59.512 --> 08:02.640
and to see confusion on the faces
of everyone around me.

08:02.748 --> 08:05.239
I'm not the most connected
individual, Denny.

08:05.351 --> 08:08.479
Sometimes words are
all that allow me to feel like...

08:08.588 --> 08:11.751
I'm a part of the world,
a part of life.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.486
If I don't have words, then I'm alone.

08:14.594 --> 08:17.427
Ashtray soda pop dingo?

08:21.100 --> 08:22.727
Gotcha.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.099
Now, relax.

08:31.277 --> 08:33.438
Wes was obsessed with the game.

08:33.546 --> 08:37.174
All the kids were talking about it.
It was the only thing he wanted for his birthday.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.409
- So you bought it for him?
- Yes.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.615
He would play before school, after school,
in the middle of the night.

08:43.722 --> 08:47.921
He'd played other video games before,
but this one- this one was different.

08:48.027 --> 08:51.485
He couldn't stop. His grades began to slip,
so I took the game away.

08:51.597 --> 08:54.259
- How did he react?
- We argued constantly.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.699
So he began going to friends'
houses after school to play.

08:56.802 --> 08:59.862
I realized I couldn't win,
so I gave him the game back...

08:59.972 --> 09:01.872
figuring I could keep an eye on him.

09:01.974 --> 09:04.204
What happened
the weekend your son died?

09:04.310 --> 09:07.040
I got home after working
a double shift at the store...

09:07.146 --> 09:12.311
and, um, I only had 15 minutes
to change before I left for my second job.

09:12.418 --> 09:14.318
I clean offices.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.082
I told Wes it was time to quit.

09:17.189 --> 09:21.421
He said hejust needed five more minutes
to get to the next level.

09:21.527 --> 09:24.553
He promised he would go to bed
as soon as he was finished.

09:24.664 --> 09:27.394
So I kissed him,
said good night and went to work.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.468
What time did you arrive home?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.469
About 5:00 the next morning.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.732
I just fell into bed with my clothes on.

09:33.839 --> 09:36.967
I woke up at noon
and went to check on him.

09:38.678 --> 09:40.737
And that's when I found him.

09:40.846 --> 09:44.976
He was slumped in his chair
in front of the screen.

09:45.084 --> 09:49.180
You know, at first, I thought
he'd just fallen asleep.

09:52.191 --> 09:55.422
- Would you like to take a recess?
- No.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.588
I would rather get this over with.

10:02.368 --> 10:04.700
Mrs. Beller, how old was Wesley?

10:04.804 --> 10:06.704
Fifteen.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.865
- And you're a single parent?
- Yes.

10:08.975 --> 10:11.205
Wes's father is no longer in the picture.

10:11.310 --> 10:15.007
So you were responsible for his clothing,
feeding him, taking care of him when he was sick?

10:15.114 --> 10:19.346
- Yes.
- You made sure he ate right, got enough sleep, did his homework.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.444
- I took very good care of my son.
- I'm sure you did.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.291
And yet the coroner's report lists
the cause of death as a myocardial infarction...

10:27.393 --> 10:28.951
brought on by physical exhaustion.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.393
Apparently your son
did not eat, drink or sleep...

10:31.497 --> 10:33.465
for over 36 hours straight.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.364
Now, I can't speak to the pain
that you must be feeling.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.369
But how did this happen?

10:38.471 --> 10:43.238
- I work two jobs, Mr. Chase.
- I understand that.

10:43.342 --> 10:46.743
But I can't help wondering that if you
had checked in on your son that night...

10:46.846 --> 10:48.746
instead of falling asleep...

10:48.848 --> 10:50.748
that maybe he'd be alive today.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.410
- Now, isn't that correct?
- Objection. Don't answer that.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.141
What's the problem?

11:19.245 --> 11:22.476
In responding to Mrs. Beller's production
requests, we came across something.

11:22.581 --> 11:24.811
When your company
designed Hellbourne...

11:24.917 --> 11:29.820
you commissioned a study that documented
the effects the game had on its players.

11:29.922 --> 11:33.153
The report states that playing the game
dramatically increases...

11:33.259 --> 11:35.750
the dopamine levels
in the players' brains.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.853
- I'm aware of it, sure.
- Chris, this means Mrs. Beller can argue...

11:38.964 --> 11:42.127
that Alcove knew their games were addictive
when they sold them to the public...

11:42.234 --> 11:44.964
including minors.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.869
Oh, that's ridiculous.
It's just one study.

11:47.973 --> 11:49.873
Besides, it's an established fact...

11:49.975 --> 11:52.967
that all video games increase
the dopamine levels in the brain.

11:53.079 --> 11:54.979
At least the good ones do.

11:55.081 --> 11:58.812
Are there any other studies out there?
Anything like this that can bite us in the ass?

11:58.918 --> 12:01.216
No. Just the one.

12:02.655 --> 12:06.284
Okay. We're required
to turn this over to Mrs. Beller.

12:06.392 --> 12:10.226
As per the rules of discovery, we'll provide it
with 100,000 other pages of documents...

12:10.329 --> 12:13.059
that pertain to this production request.

12:13.165 --> 12:16.965
- So you're gonna bury it.
- No. That would be unethical.

12:17.069 --> 12:21.233
We'll simply comply... fully.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.479
It's not religious.
It's practical.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.481
I'm a dietitian at Mercy Hospital.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.485
And what does every working mother
always plead? "I wish I had a wife. "

12:34.587 --> 12:36.248
Well, I actually do.

12:36.355 --> 12:38.255
Imagine leaving for yourjob...

12:38.357 --> 12:42.657
and never having to worry about day care,
late babysitters, nightmare nannies.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.858
Your child gets sick, you have someone there
you trust who loves your children...

12:46.966 --> 12:51.164
someone with a warm home, who cooks
healthy homemade meals for your children...

12:51.270 --> 12:55.297
and has a lovingly prepared dinner
waiting for you when you walk in the door.

12:55.407 --> 12:57.875
- Someone who bakes.
- Sounds wonderful.

13:01.881 --> 13:05.442
- Continue.
- And our kids love it too.

13:05.551 --> 13:10.215
At any one time, there's a parent
to give a hug, some advice, share a story.

13:10.322 --> 13:13.450
Families these days are no longer together,
scattered across the country.

13:13.559 --> 13:17.290
Ours is simply another form
of an old-fashioned extended family.

13:18.964 --> 13:22.195
Who are we kidding?
It's about the sex.

13:22.301 --> 13:25.202
I'm a stay-at-home mom.
I have three kids, ages one to six.

13:25.304 --> 13:29.536
That's 24-7 breast-feeding,
potty training, fever, solid food...

13:29.642 --> 13:33.544
diapers, ear infections,
dishes, homework, toys, chaos.

13:33.646 --> 13:38.811
Raising children is the single most exhausting job
ever, anywhere, anyhow.

13:38.918 --> 13:42.319
Did I make myself clear? I'll say it again.
It is the most exhausting job ever.

13:42.421 --> 13:44.218
- Don't you think?
- Absolutely.

13:44.323 --> 13:47.486
- Objection.
- Sustained.

13:47.593 --> 13:50.756
Strike that last remark, even
though it's completely true.

13:50.863 --> 13:55.163
- Alena, you were telling us about sex?
- Oh, yes.

13:55.267 --> 13:59.226
I love my children.
But by the end of the day, I am bone tired.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.238
My husband comes home-
he's tired too.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.173
But somehow he still has
a little energy for baby-making.

14:04.276 --> 14:06.244
If we were in a traditional marriage...

14:06.345 --> 14:08.836
at that moment we would have
an explosive argument.

14:08.948 --> 14:11.781
But since we're not, when I am that exhausted
and he has that look in his eye...

14:11.884 --> 14:15.684
I simply ship him off to Evette
where she satisfies him, and he her...

14:15.788 --> 14:19.781
and then I draw myself
a nice hot bath and read the paper.

14:38.844 --> 14:40.607
This works for me.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.079
I knew it would.

14:43.182 --> 14:45.150
More gobbledygook, please.

14:45.251 --> 14:48.982
Hey, take it easy, man.
Deep breaths. Just relax.

14:49.088 --> 14:52.455
Denny, I meant to say "gobbledygook. "
The stuff on my face.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.150
Oh.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.889
I think I've decompressed.
My word salad days have wilted.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.963
May I have my hand, please?

15:05.771 --> 15:09.332
Thank you, Denny.
This is almost as good as fishing.

15:12.578 --> 15:16.571
Denny's my friend. He takes me
to nice places, buys me nice things.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.845
- We like to dress up.
- Flamingos.

15:26.091 --> 15:30.687
Your Honor, there's not a shred of evidence
for which a jury would rule against my client.

15:30.796 --> 15:34.823
As tragic as his death may be,
plaintiffs have not shown any causal link...

15:34.934 --> 15:37.767
between Mr. Beller's death
and his playing Hellbourne.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.861
We have the internal dopamine study.

15:39.972 --> 15:43.237
That's one study which shows
that playing any video game...

15:43.342 --> 15:45.435
could raise anyone's dopamine level.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.876
That's hardly enough
to prove causation.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.710
I have to agree, Mr. Hoberg.
If your only evidence is this one study-

15:50.816 --> 15:52.943
- We have a witness, Your Honor.
- What witness?

15:53.052 --> 15:54.644
Dr. Samuel Williams.

15:54.753 --> 15:58.120
He'll testify that not only did Alcove Games
know their games were addictive...

15:58.223 --> 16:00.350
they intentionally
tried to make them so.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.791
That is the first we're hearing of this,
Your Honor.

16:02.895 --> 16:07.059
- Dr. Williams just came forward.
- Your Honor, they're stalling and wasting the court's time.

16:07.166 --> 16:11.626
Before ruling on the motion,
the court will hear Dr. Williams.

16:11.737 --> 16:14.535
But, Mr. Hoberg, I don't like surprises.
Tread carefully.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.803
- Your Honor, I-
- Your objection is noted for the record, Mr. Chase.

16:17.910 --> 16:20.743
The court will hear
Dr. Williams's testimony.

16:20.846 --> 16:22.746
I thought you said
there was nothing else.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.748
Dr. Williams is
a psychologist we hired...

16:24.850 --> 16:27.318
to consult on how to make our games
more appealing to the consumer.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.547
It didn't work out, and we fired him.
It's not a big deal.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.989
Chris, we need to get this case thrown out
now while it's only in front of a judge.

16:34.093 --> 16:37.654
We've got a woman with a dead kid. Ajury
is gonna want to make somebody pay for that.

16:37.763 --> 16:41.255
Now, did you hire this Dr. Williams
to make your games more addictive or not?

16:42.768 --> 16:45.259
I started with nothing.
I built this company.

16:45.371 --> 16:48.568
I employ hundreds of people.
I didn't do anything wrong.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.665
Okay. Right.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.336
You've known me for 20 years,
and you're doubting me?

16:53.445 --> 16:57.506
This isn't about friendship. This is about
getting rid of this case quickly and quietly.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.516
Now, maybe we should
consider settling.

16:59.618 --> 17:03.452
No. No. To me, a settlement
is an admission of guilt.

17:03.555 --> 17:08.515
Alcove Games is not gonna be a scapegoat
on this, even if this goes public.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.608
Dr. Klaywig,
as a historian of family law...

17:26.712 --> 17:29.613
could you tell us why laws
against polygamy were enacted?

17:29.715 --> 17:32.183
The origins, of course, are biblical.

17:32.284 --> 17:36.448
But in recent history, they were enacted
to prevent a man from abandoning his wife...

17:36.555 --> 17:39.456
leaving her with no means
of income for herself or her children.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.550
They also prevented
enslavement and abuse.

17:42.661 --> 17:45.562
Before these laws were solidified,
elders in certain communities...

17:45.664 --> 17:48.724
would simply divvy up the young girls,
12 and 13 years old...

17:48.834 --> 17:50.233
among the old men.

17:50.335 --> 17:51.893
Thank you.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.408
Dr. Klaywig, would you agree...

17:58.510 --> 18:02.742
that Mr. and Mrs. and Mrs. Richardson's
relationship is unusual?

18:02.848 --> 18:04.907
Yes, I would.

18:05.017 --> 18:08.145
- And would you agree that it's
unusual because it works? - Well-

18:08.253 --> 18:12.314
All parties are satisfied. The children,
as we've proven earlier, are well-adjusted.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.187
It does seem to work, doesn't it?

18:14.293 --> 18:16.318
Yes, I suppose so.

18:16.428 --> 18:21.263
When polygamy laws were enacted, it was under
a different social and economic construct.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.766
- Meaning?
- Meaning that women weren't allowed to work.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.429
They were, in effect,
less powerful than they are today.

18:26.538 --> 18:29.439
Their reliance on their husbands
was more substantial.

18:29.541 --> 18:31.839
One could agree.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.175
And for the record,
what is the divorce rate in this country?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.249
- Approximately 43%.
- Forty-three percent.

18:38.350 --> 18:41.251
And what are the statistics
on extramarital affairs?

18:41.353 --> 18:45.847
Conservative estimates say about 60%
of married men and 40% of married women...

18:45.958 --> 18:48.449
will have an extramarital affair
at some point.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.461
So one could argue that we're already
practicing polygamy in this country.

18:51.563 --> 18:53.895
- We just haven't institutionalized it yet.
- Objection, Your Honor.

18:53.999 --> 18:57.958
Ms. Bauer is simply twisting statistics to
make a mockery of the institution of marriage.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.901
I'm simply drawing conclusions
based on fact.

19:00.005 --> 19:02.235
- It's specious.
- It's not specious. It's logical.

19:02.341 --> 19:05.538
- You wouldn't understand.
- I don't see a wedding ring on your finger.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.633
- Divorced.
- How long?

19:06.745 --> 19:07.803
- One year.
- Two for me.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.143
Counselors?

19:10.249 --> 19:11.807
The case.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.385
- Of course.
- Right.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.319
Nothing further.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.495
Wow.

19:32.037 --> 19:34.005
Double wow.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.776
- Go right ahead.
- Uh, no. You saw her first.

19:38.877 --> 19:42.176
- You really don't mind?
- Please.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.684
Wow.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.888
Mmm.
Nobody's sitting here.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.958
Thank you.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.126
My name's Alan Shore.
What's yours?

19:58.230 --> 20:01.290
- Jessica.
- What are you reading, Jessica?

20:01.400 --> 20:03.300
- Uh, The Da Vinci Code.
- Ah.

20:03.402 --> 20:05.529
Yeah. It's okay.
Have you read it?

20:05.637 --> 20:08.868
No, it's enough for me that Leonardo
was a brilliant painter and engineer...

20:08.974 --> 20:11.442
without turning him into
the Karl Rove of the 16th century.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.608
Are you here with someone?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.614
Alone.

20:17.716 --> 20:22.119
I just, um, needed to
get out of Dodge and relax.

20:24.556 --> 20:28.390
Only now I find myself very relaxed.

20:28.493 --> 20:33.556
Two can play dominoes
for gangs allow freedom white.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.325
I'm sorry?

20:36.435 --> 20:41.236
The danger in whistling cannot
be undone by hybrid chatter.

20:41.340 --> 20:44.798
It's simply orange above all.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.674
Is this like a joke or-

20:47.779 --> 20:49.576
Zebra.

20:51.016 --> 20:54.577
Waiter, I'm going to
need another mojito.

21:03.195 --> 21:07.063
- Should I charge that to your room, sir?
- Paisley.

21:12.337 --> 21:14.828
Dr. Williams...

21:14.940 --> 21:16.931
you're a clinical psychologist.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.408
Why did Alcove Games hire you?

21:19.511 --> 21:21.809
Their game was already popular...

21:21.913 --> 21:25.872
but the company wanted to take the desire
to play the game to the next level.

21:25.984 --> 21:29.476
In other words, change the motivation
from "I want to play this game"...

21:29.588 --> 21:31.556
to "I have to play this game. "

21:31.657 --> 21:33.625
And how did they
go about doing that?

21:33.725 --> 21:35.625
It starts with causing an adrenaline rush.

21:35.727 --> 21:39.060
Most effective way to trigger that rush is
to make someone think they're going to die.

21:39.164 --> 21:42.531
- How do you know that?
- We measure the effect in two ways.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.727
The first is blink rate.

21:44.836 --> 21:48.363
And second, we monitor the amount of dopamine
that's produced while playing the game.

21:48.473 --> 21:51.135
What is the significance
of the dopamine?

21:51.243 --> 21:53.302
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter.

21:53.412 --> 21:58.975
It's also connected to the reinforcing effects
of drugs like cocaine and amphetamines.

21:59.084 --> 22:02.212
It's often called
the master molecule of addiction.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.154
And why is that significant
in terms of this video game?

22:05.257 --> 22:09.159
Playing this video game
is like receiving a jolt...

22:09.261 --> 22:11.889
equivalent to
an injection of amphetamines.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.558
And my duty was to help create a game...

22:15.667 --> 22:18.602
that would maximize dopamine
output for the players.

22:18.704 --> 22:22.333
You were deliberately trying to
make this game physically addictive?

22:24.343 --> 22:27.244
Yes.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.611
- Who was your supervisor at Alcove Games?
- Bob Kendall.

22:30.716 --> 22:33.184
- And his title?
- Vice president of marketing.

22:33.285 --> 22:36.686
Of marketing, not of secret brain addiction
research or something like that?

22:36.788 --> 22:39.188
- Objection.
- Sustained.

22:39.291 --> 22:42.522
- So you worked in the marketing department at Alcove Games.
- Yes.

22:42.627 --> 22:46.119
As a marketer, whether you're selling iPods
or breakfast cereal or soft drinks...

22:46.231 --> 22:48.859
isn't one of your primary concerns...

22:48.967 --> 22:50.958
"How do I get consumers
to buy my product?"

22:51.069 --> 22:54.038
- Of course.
- You ever been employed by a heroin dealer?

22:56.141 --> 22:58.200
- Excuse me?
- Of course you haven't.

22:58.310 --> 23:00.471
A heroin dealer doesn't need
to hire a marketing department...

23:00.579 --> 23:04.777
because the product they sell really is addictive,
as opposed to video games, which aren't.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.441
- Isn't that correct?
- Objection!

23:06.551 --> 23:08.451
Nothing further.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.704
Ray Richardson
married two women at the same time.

23:34.813 --> 23:36.781
No one denies that fact.

23:36.882 --> 23:39.578
The defense argues that
this polygamous marriage is practical...

23:39.684 --> 23:42.448
that it makes sense
in today's hectic world.

23:42.554 --> 23:45.022
Well, the law against polygamy
is practical as well.

23:45.123 --> 23:48.251
Say you're a man with good health insurance
and a generous nature.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.591
Why not go down to a hospice
and marry 50 terminally ill women...

23:51.696 --> 23:53.664
so they can have your health benefits?

23:53.765 --> 23:55.960
If a billionaire
could marry a thousand women...

23:56.067 --> 23:59.093
and claim them all as dependents
on his tax return, don't you think he would?

23:59.204 --> 24:01.434
No, the law against polygamy...

24:01.540 --> 24:03.770
doesn'tjust make sense
from a moral point of view.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.775
It's practical as well.

24:05.877 --> 24:09.335
Today the traditional family is under
constant assault from every direction.

24:09.448 --> 24:13.782
One refuge-maybe the last refuge
against that assault-is the law.

24:13.885 --> 24:18.845
The law in this case states that marriage
is between one man and one woman.

24:18.957 --> 24:22.449
Ray Richardson broke that law.

24:22.561 --> 24:24.529
Make him pay for it.

24:26.064 --> 24:29.124
Decades ago,
the nuclear family implied...

24:29.234 --> 24:31.395
one man, one woman and their offspring...

24:31.503 --> 24:33.471
usually of the same race.

24:33.572 --> 24:38.134
Today there is no limit
to what loving families look like.

24:38.243 --> 24:42.236
We have single mothers, single fathers,
two mommies, two daddies...

24:42.347 --> 24:44.247
ex-wives, ex-in-laws, you name it.

24:44.349 --> 24:47.807
If we're going to
universally apply a law...

24:47.919 --> 24:51.719
we need to look at what it is
that law strives to protect.

24:51.823 --> 24:56.590
Nobody can say that the Richardsons
are not a loving family.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.925
They're honest and caring.

24:59.030 --> 25:02.557
Their children are confident and kind.

25:02.667 --> 25:06.000
With so many monogamous
couples breaking up...

25:06.104 --> 25:09.096
this true family unit should
be held in high esteem.

25:09.207 --> 25:11.539
Instead, we seek to destroy them...

25:11.643 --> 25:14.612
simply because
they consensually engaged...

25:14.713 --> 25:18.809
in a loving relationship
that all parties wanted.

25:20.418 --> 25:22.852
You've heard both Mrs. Richardsons.

25:22.954 --> 25:25.752
This is a family unit that works.

25:25.857 --> 25:29.088
If you put Ray Richardson in jail
when all he was...

25:29.194 --> 25:31.856
was a good husband
and a good father...

25:31.963 --> 25:34.488
you will accomplish the very harm...

25:34.599 --> 25:37.591
the anti-polygamy laws
set out to prevent.

25:37.702 --> 25:41.798
You will tear
the Richardson family apart.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.718
You need to relax, you know?

25:58.823 --> 26:01.485
Obviously, Denny.

26:01.593 --> 26:05.222
But telling me to do so is like saying to
a starving man, "You just need money. "

26:05.330 --> 26:07.890
- It doesn't exactly solve the problem.
- We got lots of money.

26:07.999 --> 26:12.129
So if you're hungry, just order up
room service and say "hello. "

26:12.237 --> 26:15.001
Hey! You just touched me,
and not in a nice way.

26:15.106 --> 26:17.574
Could I please have a little privacy?

26:17.676 --> 26:21.669
So you mix up your words.
Make it work for you. That's what I do.

26:21.780 --> 26:24.010
Denny, get out. Leave the room
for a moment and let me be alone.

26:24.115 --> 26:25.912
You're a moody traveler, aren't you?

26:26.017 --> 26:28.417
Can you please
put your narcissism aside for one second...

26:28.520 --> 26:31.853
and try to imagine what it's like
for a person to be losing his mind?

26:36.661 --> 26:38.629
I'm sorry.

26:38.730 --> 26:42.029
It's just I'd penciled in
sex today for 5:30.

26:42.133 --> 26:45.432
And since I lost out on Jessica,
I'll now have to have it alone.

26:45.537 --> 26:49.166
Which is fine.
Just... predictable.

26:50.875 --> 26:53.673
All this time I thought you
were empathizing with me...

26:55.413 --> 26:57.973
but you were sympathizing.

27:03.054 --> 27:04.817
- I'm going home.
- Denny.

27:04.923 --> 27:08.484
- Don't talk to me.
- Please don't leave.

27:08.593 --> 27:12.051
I said, do not talk to me!

27:12.163 --> 27:14.495
It's just that's my suitcase.

27:16.001 --> 27:17.992
You're packing my things.

27:38.056 --> 27:41.514
He was 15! He was about to
get his learner's permit.

27:41.626 --> 27:43.355
I'm sorry, but I can't talk to you.

27:43.461 --> 27:46.328
He was a scout too, in this day and age,
and he was going for Eagle.

27:46.431 --> 27:49.764
- I'm sorry.
- You know that everything that Dr. Williams said is true.

27:49.868 --> 27:53.895
And the only thing that this should be about
is Wes and the life that was taken from him.

27:54.005 --> 27:58.271
But it's not! It is about lawyers
and your talking and your arguing!

27:58.376 --> 28:02.107
Why are you doing this? You know
what the truth is here! You know it!

28:02.213 --> 28:04.511
- So why are you doing it?
- Mrs. Beller. Mrs. Beller.

28:04.616 --> 28:07.084
- You know what the truth is, don't you?
- Come with me.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.619
You know! You know!

28:24.002 --> 28:27.961
Mr. Foreman, has thejury
reached a unanimous verdict?

28:28.073 --> 28:32.169
- We have, Your Honor.
- Will the defendant please rise?

28:33.511 --> 28:35.411
What say you?

28:37.315 --> 28:40.307
In the matter of
the Commonwealth versus Ray Richardson...

28:40.418 --> 28:42.716
on the count of polygamy...

28:42.821 --> 28:45.551
we, thejury,
find Ray Richardson guilty.

28:47.192 --> 28:50.628
The defendant will be
remanded into custody.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.720
We are adjourned.

28:55.767 --> 28:59.931
- This isn't over.
- Come on.

29:04.042 --> 29:05.942
I'm so sorry.

29:24.629 --> 29:29.293
When I was 15, I smoked cigarettes
for a week because a friend of mine smoked.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.368
I quit.
Never smoked again.

29:31.469 --> 29:33.437
And thank goodness it didn't hurt me.

29:33.538 --> 29:37.497
But tobacco companies have been found liable,
assessed penalties in the millions of dollars...

29:37.609 --> 29:41.568
because cigarettes are addictive
and they do kill people.

29:41.679 --> 29:44.147
Your Honor, with this case,
we're in the same position...

29:44.249 --> 29:48.549
as the people who first brought legal action
against the tobacco companies 40 years ago.

29:48.653 --> 29:52.282
Lawsuit after lawsuit against tobacco
was thrown out of court.

29:52.390 --> 29:54.324
How many people died as a result?

29:54.425 --> 29:56.985
And now we got a boy
who died playing a video game...

29:57.095 --> 30:01.896
a game scientifically constructed
to make him addicted to it.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.161
Will everyone
become addicted to it? No.

30:04.269 --> 30:07.295
But other children will
become addicted, Your Honor...

30:07.405 --> 30:10.340
and there will be other deaths.

30:10.441 --> 30:13.069
It's time to let a jury decide...

30:13.178 --> 30:16.807
who's responsible for
the death of Wesley Beller.

30:35.099 --> 30:38.432
Your Honor, I know I'm supposed to be
a dispassionate advocate for my client's position...

30:38.536 --> 30:41.664
but I have to tell you
that this case-

30:41.773 --> 30:44.708
it just makes me mad.

30:44.809 --> 30:48.267
You see, I know someone
who is addicted to crystal meth.

30:48.379 --> 30:51.940
This is a lethal drug. It would've killed her
if she hadn't stopped using it.

30:52.050 --> 30:54.450
So when I hear people talk
about being addicted...

30:54.552 --> 30:57.350
to their BlackBerry,
to soap operas, video games-

30:57.455 --> 31:01.414
Believe me, if anyone who's addicted to
crystal meth could suddenly wave a magic wand...

31:01.526 --> 31:04.051
and be addicted
to video games instead...

31:04.162 --> 31:07.063
they would do it in a heartbeat.

31:07.165 --> 31:11.124
Now, you heard testimony that playing
this game raises your dopamine level.

31:11.236 --> 31:13.170
We don't deny that.

31:13.271 --> 31:16.570
But the fact is, anything you enjoy
doing raises your dopamine level.

31:16.674 --> 31:19.165
Sports, chocolate, exercise, sex.
On and on and on.

31:19.277 --> 31:21.404
When Einstein was developing
his theory of relativity...

31:21.512 --> 31:23.707
I'm sure that his dopamine level
was through the roof.

31:23.815 --> 31:27.410
Where do we draw the line
between addiction and passion?

31:27.518 --> 31:31.887
And the fact is,
this case is an insult...

31:31.990 --> 31:35.255
to anyone who has a real addiction
to a harmful substance.

31:38.029 --> 31:42.090
Now, we are all sad
that Wesley Beller is dead.

31:45.637 --> 31:48.936
But Alcove Games
did not cause his death.

32:16.701 --> 32:19.864
After reviewing the papers
and the evidence presented...

32:19.971 --> 32:21.939
I agree with Mr. Chase.

32:22.040 --> 32:26.443
The defense's motion
for summaryjudgment is granted.

32:26.544 --> 32:29.342
We're adjourned.

32:31.382 --> 32:34.351
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.682
- Brad.
- Paul.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.724
Man! I knew we'd win,
but you never really know till it's over.

32:40.825 --> 32:43.293
- You bet.
- So, champ, where can I buy you dinner?

32:43.394 --> 32:45.555
McClosky's.
Best steaks in town.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.401
Mrs. Beller.

32:58.509 --> 33:01.569
I'm truly sorry about your son.

33:02.947 --> 33:05.575
I'm sure you'll be sorry
about the next one too.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.821
A little lower.

33:20.932 --> 33:25.062
Oh, yeah.
Just a little bit lower.

33:25.169 --> 33:28.002
Not quite low enough.

33:39.017 --> 33:43.113
I have always empathized
with your mad cow.

33:44.522 --> 33:47.320
In a seismic shift of character...

33:47.425 --> 33:51.919
I was momentarily thinking
only of myself.

33:53.598 --> 33:56.032
As I said, Denny...

33:56.134 --> 33:58.898
words are my friends.

33:59.003 --> 34:01.369
To think that I might suddenly-

34:01.472 --> 34:03.440
Why are you so anxious?

34:03.541 --> 34:06.533
Here, of all places,
where people only rub you the right way?

34:06.644 --> 34:10.273
- Work. I'm nervous about work.
- Why?

34:10.380 --> 34:14.408
Denny, they could walk through
my door on any given day and just fire me.

34:14.518 --> 34:17.818
I've offended everybody
there is to offend.

34:17.922 --> 34:22.120
I was hoping to at least ingratiate myself
with Shirley sexually...

34:22.226 --> 34:24.888
but she rebuffs me.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.926
Robe, please.

34:34.237 --> 34:36.502
Out, please.

34:38.842 --> 34:41.641
Since when have you been
afraid of losing your job?

34:41.746 --> 34:45.739
You relish the idea ofbeing able
to walk at the drop of a hat.

34:45.850 --> 34:49.581
- Hell, you threaten to.
- I guess I just don't feel that freedom anymore.

34:49.687 --> 34:52.485
- Is it money?
- It's not money.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.489
What is it then?

34:55.693 --> 34:57.593
I'd miss you, Denny.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.501
You're a liar.

35:05.603 --> 35:09.300
You can't walk because you think
you have to be there to protect me...

35:09.407 --> 35:11.375
to save me from myself.

35:11.476 --> 35:13.603
That's certainly not it.

35:13.711 --> 35:17.374
For the first time in your life,
you feel trapped...

35:17.482 --> 35:19.382
and I'm the reason.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.952
Why can't we just leave it
at "I'd miss you, Denny"?

35:22.053 --> 35:24.112
Denny Crane has never needed anybody!

35:24.222 --> 35:29.216
And that's a tragedy, one for which
I empathize as well as sympathize.

35:29.327 --> 35:32.728
I will never be anybody's charity project.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.701
If that has something to do
with our friendship...

35:40.171 --> 35:42.799
I no longer want it.

35:47.812 --> 35:51.009
Have you thought for one second about
what you're doing to the Richardson children?

35:51.115 --> 35:53.583
I'm about to make parent-teacher night
a lot less awkward.

35:53.684 --> 35:55.584
I'm serious.

35:55.686 --> 35:58.883
There's a new book out that says that
there's no such thing as an amicable divorce...

35:58.990 --> 36:01.515
that children are far more
traumatized by divorce...

36:01.626 --> 36:04.493
than they would be by growing up
in a house with a bad marriage.

36:04.595 --> 36:06.392
Well, they didn't grow up in my house.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.829
And there's a study from
the University College Dublin...

36:08.933 --> 36:11.265
that found that
the effects of divorce on children...

36:11.369 --> 36:13.929
are far more damaging
than the death of a parent.

36:14.038 --> 36:16.666
Exactly how much time
do you spend on the Internet?

36:16.774 --> 36:18.674
You're not breaking up
some group of freaks here.

36:18.776 --> 36:21.506
The Richardsons work.
That family unit works.

36:21.612 --> 36:25.912
And they can remain a family
as long as they're not married.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.349
I know.

36:28.452 --> 36:30.420
I spoke to Ray and his wives...

36:30.521 --> 36:34.423
and they have all agreed reluctantly
to get divorced and live in sin.

36:34.525 --> 36:37.016
All they ask is that you
recommend probation.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.290
Denise, I-

36:41.399 --> 36:46.496
As long as he quits breaking the law,
I have no interest in putting him in jail.

36:46.604 --> 36:50.199
- I'm sure we can make this work.
- Thank you.

36:50.308 --> 36:52.538
Yeah.

36:58.649 --> 37:01.140
H- Have you had dinner yet?

37:01.252 --> 37:03.447
Um, it's 4:00.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.455
Oh. Yeah.

37:06.557 --> 37:10.049
I'm sorry.
I- I- I haven't dated in so long.

37:12.163 --> 37:16.065
Would you like to get some food
at a more appropriate time?

37:16.167 --> 37:18.829
- Today.
- Sure.

37:33.851 --> 37:36.820
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thanks.

37:36.921 --> 37:40.584
Looks like Chris wants us
to handle all his business from now on.

37:40.691 --> 37:43.251
Good.

37:43.361 --> 37:46.694
Uh, Paul, you didn't get a chance
to say hello to Rachel, did you?

37:48.032 --> 37:51.331
I did. She'll be getting
out of rehab in a few weeks.

37:51.435 --> 37:54.029
Good for her.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.700
Brad.

37:58.809 --> 38:00.936
I want you to stay away from her.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.511
Beg your pardon?

38:05.616 --> 38:09.245
As part of the 12-step
program of recovery...

38:09.353 --> 38:12.151
they strongly suggest
that she not be involved...

38:12.256 --> 38:14.622
in any relationships for a year.

38:14.725 --> 38:18.627
This allows her
to focus on mending her life.

38:18.729 --> 38:22.256
And any distractions
could jeopardize that process...

38:22.366 --> 38:25.631
and make her more susceptible
to returning to drugs.

38:26.837 --> 38:29.829
So therefore...

38:29.940 --> 38:33.376
I am strongly suggesting...

38:33.477 --> 38:36.139
that you stay away from her.

39:09.380 --> 39:12.349
Okay, so I worry about you a little.
Is that so bad?

39:12.450 --> 39:16.546
With my night terrors,
the clown phobia and now word salad...

39:16.654 --> 39:18.622
you don't worry about me?

39:25.296 --> 39:29.198
You know, strangers aren't always
gonna be there for us, Denny.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.167
I'm gonna say this once.
I don't want it repeated.

39:34.271 --> 39:36.535
I need friendship.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.700
I especially need this one.

39:51.655 --> 39:53.646
Did you not hear a word I said?

39:53.758 --> 39:55.953
Heard every word.
Thing isn't on.

40:01.432 --> 40:04.162
Is it really so horrible
for people to need each other?

40:04.268 --> 40:07.465
Doesn't it give you comfort that
I'm here to cover for you when you slip?

40:07.571 --> 40:10.631
That in the end, I'll be there to shoot you?

40:10.741 --> 40:14.074
It comforts me
that you need the friendship.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.122
I've thought about it.
I agree.

40:25.222 --> 40:27.690
You've survived here
a hundred years or so without me.

40:27.792 --> 40:30.260
I could leave,
and you'd go on just fine.

40:30.361 --> 40:33.194
But for me to go on, Denny,
I need my balcony time...

40:33.297 --> 40:35.595
whether I work here or not.

40:37.034 --> 40:38.934
You got it.

40:39.036 --> 40:42.699
Typically when I get fired,
I'm banned from the premises.

40:45.209 --> 40:49.441
Service elevator.
I got the keys.

40:49.547 --> 40:52.107
You think of everything.

40:52.216 --> 40:56.380
- Denny-
- Crane.

40:57.922 --> 41:00.686
You've got it.

41:56.647 --> 41:59.138
You stinker!
