WEBVTT

00:03.086 --> 00:06.172
[upbeat music]

00:06.923 --> 00:10.176
[pilot] L.A. tower, this is HM
Air 661 on visual two four left.

00:10.218 --> 00:11.177
[controller] HM Air 661,
you're cleared to land.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.514
[Mal] Want to share a car
into town, Kate?

00:14.556 --> 00:16.266
[Kate] I'm sorry Mal, I can't,
I have a meeting.

00:16.307 --> 00:17.600
Oh, this is the interview?

00:17.642 --> 00:19.436
It is. It's very exciting.

00:19.477 --> 00:21.855
If all goes well, by this time
next year, I'll be off the

00:21.896 --> 00:24.858
regional route hamster wheel
and onto international flights.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.192
-That's what you want.
-[Kate chuckles]

00:26.234 --> 00:28.403
Of course,
who doesn't want that?

00:28.445 --> 00:30.864
Travel, expensive hotels,
a more relaxed schedule.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.699
I've heard some of
those corporate

00:32.741 --> 00:33.783
clients can be difficult.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.162
Are you saying
I can't handle it?

00:37.203 --> 00:39.039
Of course not.
I'm just saying

00:39.080 --> 00:40.707
is that something
you want to be handling?

00:40.749 --> 00:42.709
I definitely want to be
handling that in Zurich

00:42.751 --> 00:44.210
and Venice. I'll see you.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.172
Let me know what
you're getting into.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.759
-Bye, Mal!
-[upbeat music continues]

00:51.926 --> 00:53.678
I'm so pleased you could find a
few minutes to meet

00:53.720 --> 00:56.556
on my stopover. And I'm sure you
don't have a lot of time either.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.974
Oh, no rush at all.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.976
I want to make sure to answer
all of your questions.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.895
Well, your background
check was a breeze.

01:01.936 --> 01:02.562
Your flight record
speaks for itself.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.397
You've flown the max

01:04.439 --> 01:06.566
number of hours allowed
for the last four years.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.569
Multiple certifications.
You're clearly a hard worker.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.237
Well, without work,
nothing grows

01:11.279 --> 01:13.239
but weeds,
as my dad used to say.

01:13.281 --> 01:15.658
We're looking for unique
individuals whose lifestyles

01:15.700 --> 01:16.993
are flexible and can keep up
with the demand.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.912
That sounds like me
in every way.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.998
Great. So what I
really need to know is,

01:22.040 --> 01:23.375
how available are you?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.835
I'm very, very available.

01:25.877 --> 01:27.087
-Even during the holidays?
-Yeah.

01:27.128 --> 01:30.590
What about family, partner,
household pets?

01:30.632 --> 01:31.758
Are they okay with this?

01:31.800 --> 01:34.177
I'm kind of a one-woman band.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.221
Perfect. Then I have
a flight for you.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.306
Already?

01:38.640 --> 01:40.809
I thought this was just
an exploratory interview.

01:41.142 --> 01:43.269
It was. And now
that that's done,

01:43.728 --> 01:45.605
how do you feel about flying
from L.A.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.482
to the Swiss
Alps on December 20th?

01:48.483 --> 01:51.903
Um, I uh, I feel very,
very good about it.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.738
You'll stay there

01:53.780 --> 01:54.864
with the Sharpe family
for the entire week

01:54.906 --> 01:56.950
in case
they want to travel elsewhere,

01:56.991 --> 01:59.244
then return them to L.A.
on the 27th.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.495
They're a high-powered
family,

02:00.537 --> 02:02.497
so please
take the utmost care of them.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.915
That sounds ideal.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.959
I'll get the paperwork
started in that case.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.669
-Okay.
-Do you have any questions?

02:07.961 --> 02:09.796
Uh. Yes, just one.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.966
Um, sorry. Who are the Sharpe's?

02:13.008 --> 02:14.259
[curious music]

02:14.551 --> 02:18.555
[cheerful music]

02:23.727 --> 02:27.480
[Helen] Yeah. Alright. And
double the order on the linen.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.315
It's going to be major
next summer,

02:29.357 --> 02:31.234
and I want a discount
on an order that size.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.694
Yeah. Okay, thanks. Bye.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.195
Is that my sweater, Cali?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.365
Maybe.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.409
Were you maybe going to ask me
if you could wear it?

02:40.243 --> 02:42.704
Mom, may I please
wear your sweater?

02:43.288 --> 02:44.497
It's from last year's line.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.707
I did not think you would
care.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.460
Well, that's an interesting
strategy, kiddo.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.878
Maybe we should put you
on the payroll.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.505
-No, thank you.
-Well.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.466
It looks great on you.
So, it's all yours.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.384
-Really?
-Yeah. I just wish you wouldn't

02:56.426 --> 02:58.178
wear those beat-up
boots with it.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.347
Why? Because these are so, what,
embarrassing?

03:01.973 --> 03:04.893
[soft music]

03:06.227 --> 03:09.522
Am I ever going to say anything
right to her?

03:09.564 --> 03:11.608
She's 15, so I'm gonna say no.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.026
I can't wait until I'm a
teenager and I can say

03:13.068 --> 03:15.278
-whatever I want.
-[Thomas chuckles]

03:15.320 --> 03:16.112
-Uh, no.
-[phones chimes]

03:17.405 --> 03:18.865
Great news, we've been invited
to the Alpine's

03:18.907 --> 03:20.408
cocktail party on the 26th.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.452
-Oh, great.
-What's Alpine's?

03:22.494 --> 03:23.578
Alpine's, buddy. Alpine's.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.871
It's a department store chain

03:24.913 --> 03:26.164
that's
headquartered in Zurich,

03:26.206 --> 03:27.665
and we want them to carry
our new casualwear line.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.918
Unfortunately, it means your
mom and I are going to have

03:29.959 --> 03:32.379
to do some work in between
our time on the slopes.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.464
Can we at least go ice skating
or something?

03:34.506 --> 03:36.508
-Sure. Christina will take you.
-Yes!

03:36.925 --> 03:39.636
Guys! I do not want to be
babysat by some nanny

03:39.678 --> 03:42.389
who's barely older than me.
Why are we even doing this?

03:42.430 --> 03:44.432
Can't we just
stay home for one Christmas?

03:46.059 --> 03:48.019
[Kate] You must be the Sharpe's.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.021
Hi. I am Captain Kate Gabriel.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.690
I'll be your pilot for the week.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.733
Our copilot, Derrick Murray,
is conducting

03:53.775 --> 03:55.276
a walk around now.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.571
I trust you'll be able
to help me fly the plane?

03:58.613 --> 04:00.949
Um, I don't think I'm qualified.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.035
Thomas, thanks for filling in
last minute.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.079
Our former pilot
retired suddenly,

04:06.121 --> 04:07.580
so we're looking to fill
the position.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.375
Well, I'm at your service.

04:10.417 --> 04:10.917
All right, great.
Let's go, guys.

04:10.959 --> 04:11.751
Vacation time.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.671
Um, Mom, where is Riley?

04:15.130 --> 04:16.756
-Your teddy bear?
-He's a rabbit.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.800
Oh, of course, Bunny.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.093
I am sure he is

04:20.135 --> 04:22.804
snug as a bug
in your suitcase.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.931
Our nanny did all the packing

04:24.973 --> 04:26.891
and then flew up ahead
to set up the suites.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.561
So we have rooms for you
at the hotel.

04:29.602 --> 04:33.732
A full itinerary and a list
of our contact information.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.109
Okay, so, this will be
the perfect Christmas.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.028
Don't worry about anything.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.780
I'll have you eating breakfast
in Switzerland in no time.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.365
That's what I like to hear.
[chuckles]

04:42.407 --> 04:43.867
[curious music]

04:44.159 --> 04:45.285
We're all set, Captain.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.536
Ah, excellent.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.329
And who takes care
of the luggage?

04:48.830 --> 04:49.956
[quirky music]

04:51.124 --> 04:52.667
It's us, isn't it?

04:58.006 --> 05:02.844
[cheerful music]

05:11.227 --> 05:12.562
Okay.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.356
Let's see what we got
going on tonight.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.074
[switches click]

05:27.202 --> 05:28.286
So, charter for five years.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.122
You must have some incredible
stories.

05:31.623 --> 05:32.415
Yeah.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.377
Which you're
saving for your memoirs?

05:36.544 --> 05:38.421
[thunder crashes]

05:38.797 --> 05:40.757
Listen,
you really want my advice?

05:41.466 --> 05:44.052
Keep yourself to yourself.

05:46.221 --> 05:50.975
Sorry, do you mean in general
or with our charters?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.394
'Cause I'm kind of an
expert about them.

05:54.729 --> 05:55.563
[Oliver] Three might Charlie,

05:55.605 --> 05:57.524
this is centre. Ride report?

05:57.565 --> 05:58.817
Oh, well,
life's a beach up here.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.695
No reindeer sightings, yet.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.279
I'm just about to serve
our passengers,

06:03.321 --> 06:04.989
hot cocoa and eggnog,

06:05.031 --> 06:06.282
if you care to join.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.534
[Oliver] Ride report, please.

06:07.575 --> 06:08.910
This isn't comedy hour.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.663
[Derrick] Centre, everything's
smooth up here.

06:12.080 --> 06:12.914
Thank you.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.710
And that wasn't
a joke, by the way.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.211
But if I think of one
I'll let you know.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.338
-[quirky music]
-Why do I feel like

06:20.380 --> 06:21.923
this is going to
be a long shift?

06:24.634 --> 06:26.928
Can we see the North Pole
and the elves from up here?

06:27.554 --> 06:29.556
Mh-hm, definitely,
right, Thomas?

06:29.597 --> 06:31.099
What are we talking about?
Shelves.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.892
Yeah, we can get some shelves
made for you, buddy.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.686
Hey, Cali. Can you read my
letter to Santa?

06:35.103 --> 06:35.437
Later.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.523
[curtain thwips]

06:38.940 --> 06:40.150
[Kate] Good evening.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.568
We are about to begin
our Atlantic crossing.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.778
But first,
who wants some hot chocolate?

06:44.612 --> 06:46.406
-[thunder crashes]
-[plane rattles]

06:46.448 --> 06:47.699
Please say that's normal.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.951
Oh, yeah.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.413
Just minor turbulence.
I'll be right back.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.290
[thunder crashes]

06:56.082 --> 06:57.584
[Oliver] Three might Charlie,
be advised there's a rapidly

06:57.625 --> 07:00.378
deteriorating low-pressure
system on your route.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.880
Definitely not in the forecast,

07:01.921 --> 07:03.506
we're getting reports
of severe turbulence

07:03.548 --> 07:04.466
at flight level 380.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.217
[Kate] You're not
kidding, centre.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.178
Our weather radar has lit up
like a Christmas tree.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.637
Can you give us a ride
around it?

07:09.679 --> 07:12.474
[Oliver] Three might Charlie,
not in my sector.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.059
This is a severe system.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.435
The high pressure line starts
just north of Labrador

07:15.477 --> 07:17.270
and extends all the way down
to New Jersey.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.064
I don't think anybody's
going to be

07:19.105 --> 07:19.898
getting through this
until it dissipates.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.525
I suggest you find a place
to land

07:22.567 --> 07:24.444
before you're
out over the ocean.

07:24.486 --> 07:25.945
Seriously?

07:25.987 --> 07:28.490
Is this your advice
for all aircraft?

07:28.531 --> 07:29.741
We have plenty of fuel

07:29.783 --> 07:31.326
for a longer route
and I've outrun worse.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.079
Three might Charlie,
were advising all pilots

07:34.120 --> 07:36.039
to land regardless
of their track record.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.416
Yeah, this is not going to go
over well.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.834
It's unavoidable.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.711
I'm not sure my clients
would agree with you.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.005
I promised to have
them in Europe by Christmas.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.550
There are spots
available at JFK and Logan.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.511
If either of those are
suitable for your passengers?

07:51.262 --> 07:51.971
Better check in with them,
Captain.

07:52.013 --> 07:54.391
[curious music]

07:54.432 --> 07:55.642
Be right back, Centre.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.484
Centre, this is three might
Charlie, requesting landing

08:04.526 --> 08:06.361
clearance for JFK.
Please confirm.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.363
-[Oliver] Denied.
-What?

08:08.405 --> 08:11.574
The spots have been taken.
Same with Logan.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.993
But that was literally
a minute ago.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.912
Those spots are all in high
demand.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.667
Okay, um. What else
is available?

08:20.709 --> 08:24.713
Closest option is an airport
off the coast of Nova Scotia.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.839
[Oliver] But you have
to act fast,

08:25.880 --> 08:27.007
you're running out of options.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.675
Conditions
are deteriorating quickly.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.760
Okay, uh, [clears throat]

08:30.802 --> 08:32.679
Centre,
what is our new clearance?

08:33.096 --> 08:35.724
Three might Charlie,
altimeter 288 niner.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.685
Yankee, Charlie, India,
descend and maintain 5000

08:38.727 --> 08:40.103
cleared ILS approach.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.563
Three three.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.065
-Merry Christmas, Captain.
-[quirky music]

08:46.067 --> 08:48.570
[Kate] Attention, this is your
captain, Kate Gabriel.

08:48.903 --> 08:51.656
Due to severe weather
conditions over the Atlantic,

08:51.698 --> 08:54.576
we are making a temporary stop
in Nova Scotia.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.119
Canada?

08:56.161 --> 08:57.954
So much for our easy
flight to Europe.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.915
[Kate] Please fasten your
seatbelts and prepare to land.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.628
[cheerful music]

09:13.803 --> 09:15.138
I know that this is not the

09:15.180 --> 09:18.641
layover that you wanted
and is a far cry from JFK.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.352
We didn't want any layover.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.187
I know.
I completely understand.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.690
Well, the weather is not her
fault, Thomas.

09:25.732 --> 09:26.941
I know, Helen.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.820
But we are now at an airport,
who knows where?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.739
And we need to formulate
a plan.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.409
Captain, don't you think I
should stay by the plane

09:36.451 --> 09:38.745
in case of a change in weather
and we have to prep quickly?

09:38.787 --> 09:40.246
Yeah, if you don't mind.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.373
I can stay in the bunk room

09:41.414 --> 09:41.664
and keep in touch
with the weather centre.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.625
Thank you.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.796
So, what are we going to do?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.881
Well, I will call the charter
company.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.424
They can make us
a new flight plan.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.926
They have a 24/7 help line.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.011
-[Finn] What about Santa?
-[Helen] What about him, honey?

09:55.053 --> 09:56.221
How is he going to find us
here?

09:56.262 --> 09:58.431
We will be there way
before Christmas, buddy.

09:58.473 --> 10:01.267
How do you know?
You don't even know.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.770
I am sure that the storm
won't last that long.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.814
But if it does,

10:06.481 --> 10:08.441
you don't
have to worry about it.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.610
We got a really famous
postal code.

10:10.652 --> 10:14.114
We'll get a message to Santa
if it comes to that.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.365
You can do that?

10:15.407 --> 10:16.366
Guaranteed.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.369
Storm came in fast, huh?

10:19.661 --> 10:21.746
You must be the people off that

10:21.788 --> 10:23.540
private plane
that just touched down.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.791
Yes, unexpected.

10:24.833 --> 10:25.917
I'm Captain Kate Gabriel,

10:25.959 --> 10:28.128
and these are my clients,
the Sharpe's.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.170
Jim MacLeod.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.880
-Pleased to meet you.
-Mr. McLeod,

10:30.922 --> 10:32.173
You work here at the airport.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.134
We would appreciate some on
the ground info.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.094
No, I'm afraid not.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.097
I'm employed by His Majesty's
Postal Service.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.975
But here's a man
who might have a few answers.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.769
Oliver!

10:44.811 --> 10:47.147
How about a latest
weather report?

10:47.188 --> 10:48.648
Yeah, hi.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.150
Unfortunately,
it looks like the storm

10:50.191 --> 10:51.735
is worsening,
sitting off the coast,

10:51.776 --> 10:53.820
so, no planes are going to be
taking off across the Atlantic

10:53.862 --> 10:55.030
tonight, that's for sure.

10:56.614 --> 10:59.075
Sorry to be the
bearer of bad news. Again.

11:00.035 --> 11:02.370
-[curious music]
-It's you.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.665
You're get the guy up there
and now we're down here.

11:05.707 --> 11:06.958
And you're down here, too.

11:07.751 --> 11:09.085
Only in a small town.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.463
This is where I live.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.673
You live at the airport?

11:13.715 --> 11:16.217
No, silly.
Nobody lives at an airport.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.595
No, no, not here.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.180
There. Christmas Island.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.681
Christmas what?

11:21.723 --> 11:23.183
The nearest town
around these parts.

11:23.224 --> 11:24.809
The only town
around these parts.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.603
There's a place called
Christmas Island?

11:26.644 --> 11:28.104
Yes, there is indeed.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.857
This is all very cute, but

11:30.899 --> 11:33.193
our kids need dinner
and we need accommodations.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.070
And I'm not overnighting
in an airport lounge. I'm not.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.822
There's a great B and B
on Forsyth Street.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.701
Great. See?
What's the name?

11:41.743 --> 11:43.870
-I'll make a booking.
-They're always

11:43.912 --> 11:45.580
usually booked up
around this time of year.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.541
Well, you're just the bearer
of bad news aren't you?

11:48.583 --> 11:51.169
[Thomas] Uh, Mr. MacLeod?
You know the area around here.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.923
So what would you suggest
we do for our very brief stay?

11:55.256 --> 11:56.800
Well,
first start by calling me Jim.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.553
You and your family are

12:00.595 --> 12:03.765
more than welcome
to bunk at my place.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.183
And I bet my daughter

12:05.225 --> 12:08.144
Maggie has an extra room
for Captain Gabriel.

12:08.645 --> 12:09.771
She's
mayor of Christmas Island,

12:09.813 --> 12:13.274
and she's all about people
coming together.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.818
So, let me get my coat.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.447
[Jim] This way.

12:19.823 --> 12:20.740
Let's follow Jim.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.992
[Finn] Dad, where
is he taking us?

12:23.034 --> 12:24.661
[Thomas] I'm not
exactly sure, pal.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.122
-I'm sure it'll be comfortable.
-[quirky music]

12:28.415 --> 12:29.916
And awkward.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.634
-[car door slams]
-It's a tad squeezy.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.219
I could take a cab.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.387
Not around here.
Walter's done for the night.

12:42.846 --> 12:45.765
-[car door slams]
-I'll take you lot in,

12:45.807 --> 12:48.101
Oliver, you take the captain.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.728
Christmas Island, here
we come!

12:49.769 --> 12:52.022
-Come on, let's go!
-For one night.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.107
-Just one.
-Okay.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.859
Have a fun singular night.

12:56.359 --> 12:59.154
-[car engine revs]
-See you, see you.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.492
Your taxi awaits

13:04.868 --> 13:07.162
[quirky music]

13:14.002 --> 13:16.796
* Deck the halls
with boughs of holly*

13:16.838 --> 13:18.590
* Fa-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la*

13:18.631 --> 13:20.967
Sorry, it's a little finicky.

13:21.426 --> 13:24.179
Oh, no, it's fine. Let's
just get into town.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.808
* Don we now our gay apparel*

13:28.850 --> 13:30.810
* Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la*

13:30.852 --> 13:34.814
So why do they call this place
Christmas Island?

13:34.856 --> 13:36.941
Oh it, it dates
back to the Mi'kmaq nation.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.861
One of their elders was

13:39.903 --> 13:41.905
said to have been called "Noel."

13:41.946 --> 13:43.573
And when he passed away,
they named the town after him.

13:43.615 --> 13:46.326
And what's with
all the mailbags,

13:46.368 --> 13:47.369
that Jim was hauling?

13:47.702 --> 13:48.703
[Oliver chuckles]

13:49.996 --> 13:50.747
All the kids love
getting their Christmas Island

13:50.789 --> 13:53.083
postage stamp in the mail.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.501
* Follow me in merry measure*

13:54.542 --> 13:57.379
I mean, didn't
you love Christmas growing up?

13:59.047 --> 14:00.507
* While I tell of
Yule-tide treasure*

14:00.548 --> 14:02.884
Not really. Well.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.888
[car grinding]

14:07.681 --> 14:07.931
What's that sound?

14:12.310 --> 14:15.271
-I don't know. Huh.
-[car grinding]

14:15.939 --> 14:18.650
Oh, this cannot be happening.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.985
I cannot have another

14:21.027 --> 14:23.113
transportation
related disaster today.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.115
It's just a loose wire.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.617
Let me try. That does not--

14:27.659 --> 14:28.493
No, no, no, no, no.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.911
Nobody touches this.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.414
Oh, okay. Sure. Go ahead.
Be my guest.

14:32.455 --> 14:35.041
[car squeaking]

14:35.542 --> 14:36.543
You don't understand.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.420
The Sharpe's
are my responsibility.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.338
I can't leave them alone.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.550
Flying private, it's like a,
like a curated experience.

14:43.591 --> 14:46.261
Well, Jim will curate them
until we're back in town.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.014
-Try it.
-[hood slams]

14:54.102 --> 14:55.520
[Oliver imitating Kate]
"Why don't you try it?"

14:56.229 --> 14:59.441
-All right.
-[engine revs]

15:00.942 --> 15:01.901
-[car door slams]
-[quirky music]

15:01.943 --> 15:03.737
The bearing
and your alternator

15:03.778 --> 15:05.196
needs replacing.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.074
Let's go.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.206
[cheerful music]

15:22.464 --> 15:24.632
[brakes squeaking]

15:29.095 --> 15:30.472
[car door slams]

15:31.639 --> 15:32.724
[car door slams]

15:32.974 --> 15:35.101
[gentle music]

15:36.644 --> 15:38.605
[Oliver] Listen, I just want to
say thanks for--

15:38.646 --> 15:41.107
It's so beautiful.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.238
Yeah, you know.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.283
Most people
come here for the lighthouse,

15:50.325 --> 15:53.495
but I think the street is
pretty special.

15:55.789 --> 15:58.500
Wait, where are the Sharpe's?

15:58.917 --> 16:00.335
[curious music]

16:00.627 --> 16:03.004
[people chattering]

16:10.970 --> 16:12.555
Do you know why
we're here?

16:13.056 --> 16:15.058
Apparently,
everyone in town is here.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.976
And our friend
Jim is going to speak.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.062
So until this is over,
we're stuck.

16:19.104 --> 16:22.649
[Maggie] Okay, so now turning to
something that I know

16:22.691 --> 16:24.567
you all want to talk about.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.153
Tomorrow is our annual
candy making event.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.447
[people applaud and cheer]

16:29.864 --> 16:31.116
Can I have candy for dinner?

16:31.157 --> 16:31.950
-Sure.
-No.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.451
Round that up to be us.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.996
[Maggie] And as always,
our celebrations culminate

16:37.038 --> 16:39.416
with our famous lobster
trap tree

16:39.457 --> 16:41.584
memorial
lighting on Christmas Eve.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.128
So bring out your best garb.

16:43.628 --> 16:48.216
[people appluad]

16:49.884 --> 16:52.053
The Christmas
postcard initiative.

16:52.095 --> 16:55.849
Everybody wants a message
from Santa, right?

16:55.890 --> 16:58.852
And with our beautiful
location

16:58.893 --> 17:03.189
and our unique postal code,
we can help Santa deliver.

17:03.231 --> 17:04.691
And this year,
we received a record

17:04.733 --> 17:07.569
number of cards and letters.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.738
Please come and see me
at the post office.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.906
-Thanks.
-[people appluad]

17:11.948 --> 17:15.368
I just realized
that we have some very,

17:15.410 --> 17:16.911
very special guests
in the room tonight.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.039
-Please, no.
-Surely they don't mean us.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.624
-[Maggie] The Sharpe family.
-[quirky music]

17:21.666 --> 17:26.421
They're here from Sharpe Chic,
the lifestyle brand in L.A..

17:26.713 --> 17:29.049
[people chattering]

17:29.090 --> 17:29.966
Like Martha Stewart.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.801
[people excitedly chattering]

17:34.804 --> 17:35.180
Hi. [chuckles]

17:37.766 --> 17:40.602
Oh, you're enjoying yourself.
Aren't you?

17:41.186 --> 17:42.687
-No.
-And it looks like

17:42.729 --> 17:44.606
nobody's leaving this island
for at least a couple of days.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.567
Just be glad you're
not out over the ocean.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.778
[Maggie] Okay, that's it.
Merry Christmas, everyone.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.074
Uh, days?

17:54.115 --> 17:55.909
Our nanny
is already in Switzerland.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.369
We have the meeting
with Alpine's,

17:57.410 --> 17:59.204
which could be huge for
our brand expansion in Europe.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.413
I can't believe we're
going to miss that meeting.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.124
This is worst case
scenario, clearly.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.501
[Thomas] What about
a helicopter?

18:04.542 --> 18:06.419
Maybe we can call around,
see what's available. How?

18:06.795 --> 18:08.004
Helicopter to where exactly?

18:08.046 --> 18:09.214
I don't know.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.924
[Oliver] I'm sorry.
It's not possible.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.634
The wind is still way
too strong.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.095
I'm sure you've
all had a long day.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.097
Yes, Jim, it's been very long.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.598
Let's get you home.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.891
Oh, thank you, Jim.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.227
Listen,
just give me an email

18:22.268 --> 18:24.938
that I can transfer
funds to you with.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.898
Yeah. Okay.
You ready?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.858
-Yeah. Yeah. Fire away.
-It's I am not taking your

18:28.900 --> 18:32.529
I am not, t-a-k-i-n-g
your money

18:32.570 --> 18:35.490
at Jim dot com.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.659
I can't let
you put us up for nothing.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.495
[chuckles] Come on, kids.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.289
[quirky music]

18:47.335 --> 18:50.463
Okay, look. I really need to get
my clients to Switzerland,

18:50.505 --> 18:53.717
because even though I know
the storm isn't my fault and

18:53.758 --> 18:56.011
they say that they know
it isn't my fault,

18:56.052 --> 18:57.387
they don't, really.

18:57.429 --> 19:01.141
And I can't lose my dream job.

19:01.182 --> 19:02.809
Or even that shot,
you know, shot

19:02.851 --> 19:05.520
for my dream job, for this.

19:07.856 --> 19:09.566
-This is your dream job?
-[quirky music continues]

19:10.400 --> 19:13.486
I know the optics are hard, but

19:13.528 --> 19:16.656
look, isn't there
anything that you can do?

19:16.698 --> 19:20.076
I'd say you get comfortable
at the mayor's house.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.202
It's going to be a cold night.

19:31.963 --> 19:33.631
[gentle music]

19:37.302 --> 19:38.511
[door clicks]

19:39.346 --> 19:40.638
[Kate] Hi.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.390
Just checking to see
how everyone's settling in.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.642
Thomas is upstairs
rescheduling everything.

19:44.684 --> 19:49.647
Finn is worried about Santa
and Cali is who knows where?

19:52.359 --> 19:53.443
Mrs. Sharpe, I hope you know

19:53.485 --> 19:55.153
truly sorry I am
for all of this.

19:55.195 --> 19:58.156
This has never happened to me.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.115
Being stranded at Christmas?

20:00.283 --> 20:02.702
No, being stranded anywhere,
truthfully.

20:03.203 --> 20:06.164
I appreciate that. I do.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.000
But I hope you understand
that we are two working

20:09.042 --> 20:11.586
parents who are now stuck
in the middle of nowhere

20:11.628 --> 20:15.173
without any help and really,

20:15.215 --> 20:17.217
really spotty internet.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.053
Well, I'm here to help.

20:20.637 --> 20:22.889
Yes, but you're our pilot.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.392
But I'm a pilot who can't fly
right now, so um,

20:25.433 --> 20:28.269
I am happy to help
with anything

20:28.311 --> 20:29.729
here on the ground.

20:30.355 --> 20:31.231
Like?

20:31.523 --> 20:35.068
Kids? Rescheduling?

20:35.860 --> 20:37.028
Anything that you need.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.072
And I will be checking
the weather updates

20:39.114 --> 20:41.032
every few minutes
and I will be sure to keep--

20:42.367 --> 20:42.659
What about Christmas?

20:44.703 --> 20:45.787
What about it?

20:45.829 --> 20:47.539
Well the nanny is in charge
of all

20:47.580 --> 20:49.708
the children's
holiday activities.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.085
So if
you could just take that over?

20:52.127 --> 20:53.628
[curious music]

20:53.920 --> 20:55.964
-I'm sorry, Christmas?
-Yeah.

20:56.006 --> 20:57.924
You know, just keep them
occupied until we can

20:57.966 --> 20:59.926
get out of here.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.304
Oh, you're serious?

21:03.346 --> 21:04.389
Um, yeah.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.224
-Yeah, for sure.
-Great!

21:06.266 --> 21:08.893
-Just drop an itinerary.
-Whenever you have time.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.729
But the sooner the
better, of course.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.314
-Okay.
-Wonderful!

21:14.107 --> 21:15.358
Goodnight!

21:15.400 --> 21:16.818
[Helen] Goodnight.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.154
[Maggie] Hey, hey!

21:19.195 --> 21:21.156
I bet you're wondering
where you're sleeping tonight.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.532
I'm so sorry.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.325
With all the excitement today,
I completely forgot

21:24.367 --> 21:25.577
to introduce myself.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.579
I'm Maggie. I'm the mayor of
Christmas Island.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.456
-Oh, hi.
-And this is my son, Shane.

21:29.914 --> 21:31.708
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-[Shane] Nice to meet you.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.876
[Maggie] Well,
should we head out?

21:33.293 --> 21:34.336
It's not that far.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.129
Sure.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.635
[gentle music]

22:03.823 --> 22:04.657
[Maggie] Oh, okay.

22:04.699 --> 22:06.284
So we have some fresh towels.

22:06.326 --> 22:09.621
Your bed is made,
and if you get cold, there's,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.748
there's an extra blanket
in the cupboard.

22:11.790 --> 22:13.291
Can you think of anything else
you might need?

22:13.333 --> 22:15.627
Thank you. This is so kind.

22:15.669 --> 22:16.586
You sure?

22:16.628 --> 22:18.630
Yeah, I'm good.

22:18.672 --> 22:19.631
You know, unless you know
someone who can whip up,

22:19.673 --> 22:22.175
let's say,
the perfect Christmas

22:22.217 --> 22:24.844
for two very important clients,
an impossible to please

22:24.886 --> 22:27.472
teenager, adorable Santa
fan here on Christmas Island,

22:27.514 --> 22:30.517
given the fact that I haven't
celebrated Christmas myself

22:30.558 --> 22:32.394
in years.

22:32.435 --> 22:33.353
Otherwise, I'm good.

22:34.479 --> 22:35.897
I'm sorry, it's been a long day.

22:36.481 --> 22:37.857
I wish I could help you.

22:37.899 --> 22:40.235
Oh, no, I didn't actually

22:40.276 --> 22:41.820
mean you. Uh.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.907
I, I'll figure it out.

22:45.949 --> 22:47.200
I mean,
I could try to help you.

22:47.242 --> 22:48.868
I just, I don't think
I'd be very good at it.

22:48.910 --> 22:51.663
My brother's the real
Christmas expert around here.

22:51.705 --> 22:53.665
[Oliver] Shane thinks
this is too much,

22:53.707 --> 22:56.084
but I think it's just
the right amount of cheer.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.836
[Maggie laughs] And here's
Kris Kringle himself.

22:59.546 --> 23:00.880
You're the Christmas expert.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.841
[Maggie] Yeah, he lives for it.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.635
I wouldn't say expert,

23:05.677 --> 23:07.220
but I have been called
worse.

23:07.512 --> 23:08.930
[quirky music]

23:11.641 --> 23:11.808
You two know each other?

23:15.854 --> 23:18.732
[Maggie] Okay, well.
I'm gonna go.

23:19.566 --> 23:22.110
[quirky music continues[]

23:24.446 --> 23:27.115
[Kate] So you're
Maggie's brother.

23:28.783 --> 23:29.909
The last time I checked.

23:29.951 --> 23:31.870
And you call your dad, Jim?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.079
[Oliver] It suits him.

23:33.121 --> 23:34.789
So what's this about?
You needing my help?

23:39.794 --> 23:41.880
-[door slams]
-Not necessarily your help.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.006
Just, you know, some tips

23:43.048 --> 23:44.382
on how to make a perfect
Christmas while

23:44.424 --> 23:45.884
-we're stuck here.
-Because?

23:45.925 --> 23:48.970
Because A, I don't have a clue
what to do in this town.

23:49.012 --> 23:50.055
B, the Sharpe's
are my responsibility

23:50.096 --> 23:51.556
until I get them
to their destination.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.391
-And C--
-You're not a Christmas person?

23:54.267 --> 23:56.770
I didn't say that.

23:56.811 --> 23:58.229
It's not like a Scrooge thing.

23:58.271 --> 24:01.483
It's more like a,
eating spinach thing.

24:02.400 --> 24:02.984
Spinach?

24:03.026 --> 24:05.195
Yeah.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.571
You know how
everyone always says how great

24:06.613 --> 24:09.366
Christmas is, how good it is
for you, but you never

24:09.407 --> 24:10.784
really get the muscles
you think you're going to get.

24:12.494 --> 24:13.912
Look, I know I'm
not making sense.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.374
Could you maybe just, like,
text me some links or, um,

24:17.415 --> 24:18.750
I don't know, ideas?

24:19.250 --> 24:21.044
-Yeah, I can do that.
-Thank you.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.923
Take this.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.467
How are you going
to get everyone around?

24:28.468 --> 24:29.219
What do you mean?

24:29.260 --> 24:30.178
Are you also a bus driver?

24:30.220 --> 24:31.346
[curious music]

24:32.639 --> 24:35.308
Yeah. You're a funny guy
outside the tower, huh?

24:35.350 --> 24:37.060
-[Oliver chuckles]
-We'll figure it out.

24:37.102 --> 24:38.436
Well, maybe since I'm
apparently the cause

24:38.478 --> 24:39.270
of your current predicament.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.438
I didn't say that.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.941
No, you more or less, you did.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.235
Anyway, I will be attending

24:45.276 --> 24:46.778
a lot of Christmas festivities
over the next few days.

24:46.820 --> 24:49.906
So if you or the Sharpe's
you want to tag along,

24:49.948 --> 24:51.991
you're all more than welcome.

24:52.033 --> 24:53.284
Yeah, we don't need to do that.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.745
Just be thankful you landed on
Christmas Island.

24:55.787 --> 24:57.330
That's the way we roll.

24:58.665 --> 25:01.334
-I'll keep in touch.
-[quirky music]

25:04.337 --> 25:07.465
-[phone vibrates]
-[phone chimes]

25:09.801 --> 25:11.344
[Kate] Candy-making.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.096
Can't wait.

25:13.638 --> 25:15.890
[bright music]

25:42.500 --> 25:43.626
[Helen] Yes. I am aware

25:43.668 --> 25:45.253
that this is terrible timing.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.380
We will obviously

25:47.422 --> 25:49.007
still pay for our tables
at your event,

25:49.049 --> 25:52.427
even if for some reason
we can't make it in time.

25:52.469 --> 25:54.679
But I am fully
confident we will be there.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.681
Mh-hm. Yes, absolutely.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.517
And thank
you for understanding.

25:59.559 --> 26:00.977
-Okay. Bye.
-[tablet chimes]

26:01.019 --> 26:03.355
Fully confident?

26:03.396 --> 26:05.065
Have you looked
at the weather report lately?

26:05.106 --> 26:06.566
Why don't you go outside
with your brother?

26:07.650 --> 26:09.277
Mom, he's catching
snowflakes with his tongue.

26:09.319 --> 26:11.029
Do you know how unhygienic
that is?

26:11.071 --> 26:12.155
Look how happy he is.

26:13.073 --> 26:14.240
Why don't you go?

26:14.282 --> 26:15.950
Because I'm not a child
and that's

26:15.992 --> 26:17.035
what children do.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.371
Good morning.

26:19.412 --> 26:20.705
Did you get my text?

26:20.747 --> 26:23.333
They're expecting us
in 15 minutes.

26:23.375 --> 26:24.542
Are you ready?

26:24.584 --> 26:25.460
Uh, Dad, are you going to
come candy-making?

26:26.503 --> 26:28.338
-Hm? Oh, uh, hey Kate.
-[Kate] Hi.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.006
I'd love to,
but your mom and I

26:30.048 --> 26:32.050
are stuck closing out
the corporation's year end.

26:32.759 --> 26:34.636
Honey, can I just get your
eye's on this for a second?

26:34.678 --> 26:35.011
[Helen] Absolutely.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.849
So it's true.
You are taking over Christmas.

26:40.058 --> 26:43.728
What? Oh, no, no, no.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.271
I'm just here helping out.

26:48.942 --> 26:51.736
What do you normally like to do
around Christmas?

26:51.778 --> 26:52.987
I don't know.

26:53.029 --> 26:55.740
Get dragged to some fashion show
or glitzy party,

26:55.782 --> 26:58.660
watch my parents network or
talk to their famous friends.

26:58.702 --> 27:00.328
Oh, okay.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.663
Well,
I don't think that there's

27:01.705 --> 27:05.000
a big celebrity population
on Christmas Island, but

27:05.917 --> 27:07.210
you know, we can do other

27:07.252 --> 27:10.547
Christmas-y things like

27:10.588 --> 27:12.924
sewing popcorn together

27:12.966 --> 27:16.928
and chugging
eggnog by the fireplace.

27:16.970 --> 27:17.929
You know,

27:17.971 --> 27:20.015
families
like to do that, right?

27:20.765 --> 27:23.601
You have no idea what you're
talking about, do you?

27:24.728 --> 27:26.646
No, I don't.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.274
So I found a holiday helper
who can, you know, tell us

27:29.315 --> 27:30.442
all the cool things to do
around while we're stuck here.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.777
You mean like an elf?

27:32.819 --> 27:34.237
[Oliver] I'm a bit
big for an elf.

27:34.279 --> 27:37.240
But I guess that's
an honorary designation.

27:37.282 --> 27:39.117
This is my nephew, Shane.

27:39.868 --> 27:40.660
The sleighs outside.
It's waiting.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.871
We should suit up. Let's go.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.372
I don't think we're all going

27:44.414 --> 27:46.416
to fit in your pick up, and
I'm not riding in the back.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.836
Don't you worry. That's
why I have Walter's cab.

27:49.878 --> 27:52.964
-And luckily, he was on duty.
-Are you guys heading out?

27:53.006 --> 27:54.299
-Oh, hi.
-This is my nephew, Shane.

27:54.341 --> 27:57.344
Hey, uh,
make sure you got your jackets

27:57.385 --> 27:59.971
and take your brother
a jacket as well.

28:00.013 --> 28:01.514
And your water bottles.

28:01.556 --> 28:04.726
Water bottles, stay hydrates.
And Hats. You need your hat.

28:04.768 --> 28:06.728
-We got hats. Got hats.
-[Thomas] Oh, great.

28:07.687 --> 28:10.023
-Those hats?
-[curious music]

28:10.899 --> 28:12.359
[Finn] Are we going
candy-making?

28:12.400 --> 28:14.319
[Oliver] Oh, yeah, we are.
Here you go, bud. Put this on.

28:14.361 --> 28:15.487
He seems trustworthy, right?

28:15.528 --> 28:17.489
-[Helen] He's totally fine.
-Okay.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.657
And here is your hat.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.159
Oh, no, I'm good.

28:21.201 --> 28:23.161
I only wear a hat when I'm
flying because I'm Captain.

28:23.203 --> 28:26.164
You're the one who wanted
a Christmas Island Christmas.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.209
[sighs] Yeah.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.586
Now, I'll take about any
Christmas I can get right now.

28:32.212 --> 28:34.005
[Oliver] Yeah, you're gonna wear
the hat. It's obligatory.

28:34.047 --> 28:36.091
[quirky music]

28:48.103 --> 28:50.397
[cheerful music]

28:50.855 --> 28:53.692
I think we need some serious
Yoda-like guidance or something.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.611
Oh, looking good
my young apprentice.

28:56.653 --> 28:58.488
Don't hold me to it, but I have
a feeling I know

28:58.530 --> 29:00.115
who the instructor is.

29:01.157 --> 29:02.951
Hello, everybody.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.620
I see you love that hat.

29:06.579 --> 29:09.165
If you are new to this,
don't worry.

29:09.207 --> 29:11.543
I'm an expert when it comes
to candy-making.

29:11.584 --> 29:12.877
[Kate chuckles] Of course.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.337
[Oliver] Today we're doing
an old family recipe.

29:14.379 --> 29:17.757
Barley toys and chicken bones,
it's over 100 years old.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.259
That doesn't sound
very appetizing.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.427
Nope.

29:20.468 --> 29:22.429
I thought that we were
making candy?

29:22.470 --> 29:23.555
-[Cali] We are.
-[Shane] Hey.

29:23.596 --> 29:24.764
We weren't properly introduced.

29:24.806 --> 29:27.684
-I'm Shane.
-Oh. My name's Cali.

29:28.309 --> 29:29.144
Cali?

29:30.270 --> 29:31.896
Yeah.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.773
Sorry. My parents gave me a
weird name.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.025
No, no. It's cool.

29:35.066 --> 29:37.777
So, I heard you guys are kind
of stuck here.

29:38.695 --> 29:40.155
Yeah, pretty much.

29:41.281 --> 29:42.449
[Oliver] So, you're

29:42.490 --> 29:44.659
going to turn on your burner.

29:45.535 --> 29:46.119
Turn the burners there.

29:46.161 --> 29:48.663
Add your water,

29:50.582 --> 29:52.000
Sugar.

29:54.127 --> 29:56.671
And, corn syrup.

29:57.213 --> 29:59.174
[Finn] Cali, can
you please help me?

30:00.050 --> 30:02.135
Hey, why don't you ask
Captain Kate to help you?

30:02.177 --> 30:04.387
She's the pilot, so she'll be
much better at this than I am.

30:05.680 --> 30:06.765
Hey, buddy.

30:06.806 --> 30:09.184
Okay, put this in here,
and I'll stir.

30:10.435 --> 30:11.478
Good stuff.

30:11.519 --> 30:12.896
I don't know.
By the end of this,

30:12.937 --> 30:15.398
you and I might be such
a good team that we can fly

30:15.440 --> 30:16.733
the plane together.

30:16.775 --> 30:18.943
[Finn] Yeah, maybe. I'm growing
up pretty fast.

30:18.985 --> 30:21.279
[Kate chuckles] You are.
All right, stir.

30:21.321 --> 30:22.906
Yeah, that's great.

30:22.947 --> 30:23.656
Once it's all mixed together,

30:23.698 --> 30:25.033
you bring it to a boil.

30:28.912 --> 30:29.829
-[mixture sizzles]
-[pot clatters]

30:31.206 --> 30:31.831
You okay?

30:33.041 --> 30:34.417
I'm okay.

30:34.459 --> 30:36.378
You should put cold
compress on or it'll get worse.

30:37.337 --> 30:38.380
I'm okay.

30:39.214 --> 30:41.341
You don't
like asking for help, do you?

30:42.217 --> 30:43.051
Well.

30:43.093 --> 30:45.178
No, I don't like needing help.

30:45.220 --> 30:46.221
There's a difference.

30:47.389 --> 30:48.765
Everybody needs it
every once in a while.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.601
I said I'm fine.

30:51.643 --> 30:53.228
There's lots going on.

30:53.269 --> 30:56.189
-Just, Christmas someone else.
-[curious music]

30:56.231 --> 30:56.815
Okay.

30:59.526 --> 31:00.610
Jerry,

31:00.652 --> 31:01.903
keep the legs
on the gingerbread men.

31:02.696 --> 31:03.780
Don't, don't. Don't eat it.

31:03.822 --> 31:05.907
-[Kate winces]
-[Kate blows]

31:06.491 --> 31:09.160
So, do you have the flight plan?

31:09.202 --> 31:09.744
For Santa?

31:11.204 --> 31:13.998
Okay, not funny.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.418
Like I said yesterday,
it's going to be

31:16.459 --> 31:17.544
-a couple days.
-So, tomorrow?

31:17.585 --> 31:20.422
Kate, you know,
I can't promise that.

31:21.089 --> 31:22.590
You know what I can promise,
though? I can promise

31:22.632 --> 31:25.552
the second I hear anything,
I will let you know first, okay?

31:25.593 --> 31:28.013
But in return,
you have to stop asking.

31:28.430 --> 31:28.888
-[curious music]
-Fine.

31:30.140 --> 31:31.433
Fine.

31:35.437 --> 31:36.896
Glad you got your ride working.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.940
Yeah, me too.

31:38.982 --> 31:43.278
Had something to do with the
bearing and the alternator.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.321
-Hi.
-[Finn] Oh, Mom, you're here!

31:45.363 --> 31:47.907
Yes, I was seeing double
staring at those spreadsheets,

31:47.949 --> 31:50.410
and I wanted to see how
candy-making was.

31:50.452 --> 31:53.246
Do you want to try some of the
candy I made? It's really good.

31:53.288 --> 31:54.247
Oh, yeah.

31:54.289 --> 31:57.125
[Helen] Oh, looks
very Christmas-y.

31:59.461 --> 32:01.546
Mm, wow.

32:01.588 --> 32:02.547
Those are actually
pretty good.

32:03.131 --> 32:04.507
-Ha ha ha.
-[Helen] Nice.

32:04.549 --> 32:05.717
[Finn] Where's Dad?

32:05.759 --> 32:06.676
[Helen] He's just finishing up.

32:06.718 --> 32:08.720
Hopefully he'll be here soon.

32:08.762 --> 32:10.138
These are delicious.

32:10.180 --> 32:13.600
I think the travel nerves
have made me a bit peckish.

32:13.641 --> 32:14.434
Well, save room
because we're going to

32:14.476 --> 32:15.602
Donna's Lobster Shack next.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.730
Oh, I don't like lobster.

32:18.772 --> 32:20.899
-Yeah, me neither.
-You don't like lobster?

32:21.649 --> 32:22.567
We're going to change that.

32:22.609 --> 32:23.860
But they have buttery noodles

32:23.902 --> 32:27.155
and all kinds of other stuff,
just in case you.

32:27.197 --> 32:28.615
-Thank you.
-[Maggie] Hi, Helen. Hi.

32:28.656 --> 32:32.452
I'm sorry I'm
such a big fan of yours.

32:32.494 --> 32:34.454
I would just be thrilled
if you would consider

32:34.496 --> 32:35.872
being our honorary ambassador

32:35.914 --> 32:37.624
for the Lobster
Trap tree lighting?

32:37.665 --> 32:38.291
-Oh--
-[Oliver] That's a great idea.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.959
Yeah, you should.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.836
[Helen stammering]

32:41.878 --> 32:43.630
I don't know about that.

32:43.672 --> 32:45.799
What's a Lobster
Trap tree lighting?

32:45.840 --> 32:49.135
Well, in this town,
we have a lot of lobster

32:49.177 --> 32:50.637
fishermen, and what we do
is we round up all the traps,

32:50.679 --> 32:52.972
we stack them
on top of each other,

32:53.014 --> 32:56.643
we make a tree, and then
we decorate it with buoys.

32:56.685 --> 32:59.813
Each buoy is inscribed
with somebody

32:59.854 --> 33:02.816
from our community
that was lost at sea.

33:02.857 --> 33:05.944
It's a nice way to honour
their memory.

33:05.985 --> 33:08.279
We've been doing that
five years for your dad, eh?

33:08.321 --> 33:09.406
-[Shane] Yeah.
-[Maggie] Yeah.

33:09.447 --> 33:13.159
I know it's not fancy, but

33:13.201 --> 33:15.704
it's a really important
tradition in our community.

33:15.745 --> 33:18.373
Well, I don't need fancy.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.376
What? I don't. I don't.

33:22.502 --> 33:24.421
That sounds so special.

33:24.462 --> 33:26.923
And I am very honoured
that you asked me, but I,

33:26.965 --> 33:30.010
that's three days away,
I don't think we'll be here.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.887
I mean, we're not still going
to be here, right?

33:33.930 --> 33:34.889
I don't know.

33:35.890 --> 33:38.018
Because I've been banned
from asking.

33:39.060 --> 33:41.438
I will let you all know
when you're able to leave.

33:41.479 --> 33:43.690
But until then, let's eat.

33:43.732 --> 33:44.315
Yes.

33:44.357 --> 33:48.028
[cheerful music]

33:51.281 --> 33:55.952
* I've been drinking cocoa,
hanging mistletoe*

33:57.912 --> 34:00.582
* Hear the snow, all the way*

34:00.999 --> 34:03.752
* She'll be here anyday*

34:04.210 --> 34:08.381
* But 'til then I'll keep on
calling the North Pole*

34:08.423 --> 34:13.553
* To say, hurry up,
hurry up Christmas*

34:13.595 --> 34:16.556
* I'm staying up 'cause
I can hardly wait*

34:16.598 --> 34:19.517
* And not a minute without
putting the sugar cookies out*

34:19.559 --> 34:22.896
* Shimmy down the chimney,
can't get here fast enough*

34:22.937 --> 34:25.899
* Hurry up,
hurry up Christmas*

34:25.940 --> 34:29.110
* Hurry up and
bring me all that love*

34:30.612 --> 34:33.990
[Finn] Whoa, this is so cool.

34:34.032 --> 34:34.741
[Oliver] It's pretty neat, huh?

34:34.783 --> 34:36.409
[Kate] Oh, my goodness.

34:36.451 --> 34:37.911
I can't believe the others
went back and missed this.

34:37.952 --> 34:40.413
Hey, can we point the light
wherever we want?

34:40.455 --> 34:42.123
Oh, no, no. The,

34:42.165 --> 34:43.500
the light only turns

34:43.541 --> 34:45.085
when the centre picks up
a ship approaching.

34:45.502 --> 34:47.462
All lighthouses
are automated now,

34:47.504 --> 34:49.339
so a few of us
just come up here periodically

34:49.381 --> 34:52.092
and check to see
if everything's working well.

34:52.133 --> 34:53.551
But you know what?

34:53.593 --> 34:54.761
I bet if you squint

34:54.803 --> 34:58.431
real hard,
you might be able to see

34:58.473 --> 35:01.142
reindeer practicing their flight
formations for Christmas Eve.

35:01.726 --> 35:02.060
Right there.

35:03.812 --> 35:06.022
Keep looking, okay?
Right up there.

35:08.274 --> 35:10.318
This is probably my favourite
spot in town.

35:12.404 --> 35:15.198
It's like your own Fortress
of Solitude.

35:17.784 --> 35:19.869
I like to come here and unwind

35:19.911 --> 35:21.454
after a stressful day.

35:22.831 --> 35:26.793
Imagine you had to deal with
hot shots

35:26.835 --> 35:28.378
who think they can
outrun nature.

35:29.546 --> 35:32.007
I don't know. That
sounds like a dream come true.

35:33.091 --> 35:33.842
[Oliver chuckles]

35:35.135 --> 35:37.262
I used to stare out the window
when I was a kid.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.596
Watch the planes
go by in the distance.

35:39.097 --> 35:43.810
And imagine the amazing places
they were going,

35:43.852 --> 35:44.894
and dreamed I could go, too.

35:44.936 --> 35:46.646
Then a true aviator was born.

35:46.688 --> 35:47.647
[Kate chuckles]

35:47.689 --> 35:50.358
I was raised by a single dad.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.610
After my mom left.
He was a pilot.

35:52.652 --> 35:55.572
He was gone a lot
and I spent a lot of time

35:55.613 --> 35:57.532
with my grandparents. But,

35:58.533 --> 36:01.036
he always made
flying seem so exotic.

36:01.077 --> 36:02.454
[gentle music]

36:02.704 --> 36:03.830
Of course, then I ended

36:03.872 --> 36:06.541
up on a regional circuits,
wasn't exactly

36:06.583 --> 36:07.667
living the dream.

36:08.001 --> 36:09.294
Did your dad pass away?

36:09.669 --> 36:10.712
Yeah.

36:11.004 --> 36:12.505
Yeah, when I was a teenager,

36:12.547 --> 36:15.008
actually, on the day

36:15.050 --> 36:17.218
before Christmas, which

36:17.260 --> 36:18.386
kind of coloured my holiday
memories.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.138
[gentle music continues]

36:20.388 --> 36:23.099
He was so inspiring, though.

36:24.184 --> 36:26.728
I still wear his
flight pin for luck.

36:28.563 --> 36:29.773
Although, I don't think
it really served me on

36:29.814 --> 36:31.149
this flight.

36:31.191 --> 36:32.067
Might have helped
you more than you think.

36:35.820 --> 36:37.864
So, what about you?

36:37.906 --> 36:39.741
What's on your bucket list?

36:40.450 --> 36:42.118
I don't really leave Christmas

36:42.160 --> 36:44.662
Island that often, or ever.

36:44.704 --> 36:45.747
Really.

36:47.165 --> 36:48.750
I don't like flying.

36:49.417 --> 36:51.878
In fact, I've only taken
an airplane once in my life.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.047
-Are you serious?
-Yeah. Okay.

36:54.089 --> 36:55.715
You've devoted your entire

36:55.757 --> 36:57.926
professional career
to directing flights.

36:57.967 --> 36:59.386
You see the irony in that,
right?

36:59.427 --> 37:01.054
It has not gone lost on me.

37:01.096 --> 37:02.514
Okay. [chuckles]

37:02.555 --> 37:04.724
We still haven't told Santa
we're on Christmas Island.

37:04.766 --> 37:06.226
What if he can't find me?

37:06.267 --> 37:09.688
You know, I met Santa once,
and he said that

37:09.729 --> 37:12.357
he always knows how to find
the nice boys and girls

37:12.399 --> 37:14.484
because he has so
many elves working for him.

37:14.776 --> 37:15.610
Oh.

37:16.903 --> 37:18.113
Well, I'm going to go look
for small reindeer.

37:18.154 --> 37:18.822
Okay, you do that.

37:18.863 --> 37:20.615
Tell me if you find any.

37:21.616 --> 37:22.992
You're good with kids.

37:23.034 --> 37:25.829
I've had a lot of practice
with my nephew.

37:27.330 --> 37:28.915
Especially after we lost
Kevin.

37:28.957 --> 37:30.208
[gentle music]

37:30.250 --> 37:32.544
He was the lobster
fisherman, right?

37:33.044 --> 37:34.254
Yeah. It should have been a
routine trip.

37:36.840 --> 37:39.175
Captain didn't pay attention
to the weather warnings.

37:39.217 --> 37:40.427
[Kate] I'm sorry.

37:40.468 --> 37:41.970
That's why you took the storm
so seriously.

37:42.012 --> 37:43.430
I couldn't live with myself if
something like that happened

37:43.471 --> 37:46.808
on my watch. Which is also
probably why I'm

37:47.058 --> 37:48.810
a little nervous to fly.

37:49.811 --> 37:51.646
Just one second.

37:59.779 --> 38:01.072
What are you doing?

38:01.114 --> 38:04.200
Just taking
care of one of my pilots.

38:06.077 --> 38:08.288
[gentle music continues]

38:11.082 --> 38:12.334
What?

38:13.335 --> 38:15.378
You're just, sweet.

38:16.338 --> 38:17.964
Sweeter
than I actually thought.

38:18.006 --> 38:19.758
Maybe you could revise
my title.

38:19.799 --> 38:20.633
Oh, yeah.

38:20.675 --> 38:22.886
This bearer of bad news.

38:22.927 --> 38:26.181
It's just.
What would I call you?

38:28.016 --> 38:29.517
I think I'll leave
that to you.

38:30.810 --> 38:31.603
I think I see them!

38:31.644 --> 38:32.645
I think I see the reindeer!

38:32.687 --> 38:35.315
Really? Where?

38:35.940 --> 38:37.233
[Finn] Right, there.

38:41.696 --> 38:43.865
[cheerful music]

38:55.460 --> 38:58.171
No offense, but your internet
is super weak, Mr. MacLeod.

38:58.213 --> 38:59.673
[Jim] Maybe you can include that

38:59.714 --> 39:01.675
in your online review,
if you like.

39:01.716 --> 39:02.509
I must admit,
I was a little worried

39:02.550 --> 39:03.343
about how it would turn out.

39:03.385 --> 39:05.887
But, look at this.

39:05.929 --> 39:07.681
-It's like magic.
-Looks great.

39:07.722 --> 39:09.599
[phone ringing]

39:11.434 --> 39:12.644
Jim MacLeod here.

39:12.686 --> 39:13.687
[Helen] Hi, Jim.

39:13.728 --> 39:15.188
Good morning.
It's Helen upstairs.

39:15.230 --> 39:17.732
Would you be able to send up
some coffee?

39:17.774 --> 39:19.192
I'll take care of that right
away, Helen.

39:19.234 --> 39:21.236
Thank you.

39:21.736 --> 39:22.696
[phone beeps]

39:22.737 --> 39:25.115
[cheerful music]

39:26.866 --> 39:27.992
My mom just ordered
room service, right?

39:28.284 --> 39:29.994
[Jim chuckles]

39:30.829 --> 39:32.706
Are there any lobster
rolls left?

39:32.747 --> 39:34.124
I've been staring

39:34.165 --> 39:36.001
at the screen for so long,
I'm starting to get dizzy.

39:36.042 --> 39:37.043
In the kitchen.
Fill your boots.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.046
Fill my what?

39:40.088 --> 39:41.589
I also figured
a fair rate for your stay.

39:41.631 --> 39:43.133
Oh, great.

39:43.174 --> 39:44.843
Just tell me the amount and
I'll have my accountant wire--

39:44.884 --> 39:46.011
I can't accept
your money, Tom.

39:46.052 --> 39:48.638
Well, I won't accept
any more generosity

39:48.680 --> 39:51.016
without something
in return, Jim.

39:51.057 --> 39:53.059
-What I can accept is your help.
-Oh.

39:53.101 --> 39:56.271
It'll be of use for my putting
up the lobster trap tree.

39:56.312 --> 39:58.732
Oh, right. Yeah,
Helen told me about that.

39:58.773 --> 40:00.025
It sounds like a big job.

40:00.066 --> 40:02.235
Well, you look like you come
from sturdy stuff.

40:02.277 --> 40:03.111
-[body thuds]
-[Thomas grunts]

40:03.153 --> 40:04.988
-Yeah.
-[quirky music]

40:05.572 --> 40:08.158
And you young miss,

40:08.199 --> 40:09.701
can help out
at the post office

40:09.743 --> 40:11.870
on all those bags
of postcards.

40:11.911 --> 40:13.747
No way. I'm on winter break,

40:13.788 --> 40:15.415
I can't take some part-time job.

40:15.874 --> 40:17.083
-Aw.
-[Cali] I'm recovering from the

40:17.125 --> 40:18.501
exhaustion of my school year.

40:18.710 --> 40:20.295
Don't get sulky about it.

40:20.754 --> 40:22.714
-What?
-Sulky.

40:22.756 --> 40:23.798
You get my drift?

40:23.840 --> 40:25.925
Come on, it'll be
good for you, Cali.

40:25.967 --> 40:27.260
Help you build a strong work
ethic.

40:27.302 --> 40:28.470
Like you?

40:29.804 --> 40:32.140
Then I can just stay
on my phone, call it a day.

40:32.974 --> 40:34.768
Oh, well,
I had a part-time job

40:34.809 --> 40:36.728
at a coffee shop
when I was your age.

40:36.770 --> 40:38.438
It gave me independence.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.023
I think it'd be good

40:40.065 --> 40:41.399
for all of us
to get out of the house.

40:41.691 --> 40:45.111
Sin Bud, what do you say, huh?

40:45.153 --> 40:46.821
Are you going to help me
with the lobster traps

40:46.863 --> 40:49.699
or the letters
to Santa with your sister?

40:49.741 --> 40:52.118
I want to work on the letters
so I can be sure that

40:52.160 --> 40:53.578
Santa gets my list.

40:53.620 --> 40:55.914
Ah. Whoa.

40:55.955 --> 40:58.750
Look at that.
He's going to love that.

40:58.792 --> 41:00.293
Tomorrow is going to be busy.

41:00.335 --> 41:02.045
That is, of
course, if we're still here.

41:02.087 --> 41:04.339
[curious music]

41:10.512 --> 41:13.139
[cheerful music]

41:16.017 --> 41:17.018
[truck door slams]

41:21.981 --> 41:23.692
[Oliver] Hey, everybody.
-Hey.

41:24.609 --> 41:26.903
It is cold out here for you
California kids.

41:26.945 --> 41:27.779
You've got your coat.

41:27.821 --> 41:29.322
Bundle up. Hats, gloves?

41:29.364 --> 41:30.490
What are you doing today, Mom?

41:30.532 --> 41:33.660
Oh, I have a few things up
my sleeve.

41:34.536 --> 41:35.537
Okay. Have fun.

41:39.874 --> 41:41.459
Oh, so you're tree
delivery, too, huh?

41:41.501 --> 41:44.963
Well, Maggie's at work today,
and Shane's at a holiday party,

41:45.005 --> 41:46.089
so, today I am.

41:48.508 --> 41:50.176
How about you guys?
Are you excited or what?

41:50.218 --> 41:51.553
Excited to go to work?

41:51.594 --> 41:53.221
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

41:54.639 --> 41:57.726
And then we can come back here
and help decorate this guy.

41:57.767 --> 42:00.311
Oh, that's very kind of you,
but I don't want to interrupt

42:00.353 --> 42:02.147
-with your family time.
-[Oliver] Oh, no, no, no.

42:02.188 --> 42:03.690
They'll love it. Trust me.

42:03.732 --> 42:04.691
We'll bring the tree
over there afterwards, okay?

42:04.733 --> 42:07.277
And we've never done it before.

42:07.318 --> 42:10.071
-[Oliver] Decorate?
-[scoffs] That's not true.

42:10.113 --> 42:11.281
It's not true.

42:11.322 --> 42:12.365
We used to decorate
when you were little.

42:12.407 --> 42:14.826
We loved decorating a tree.

42:14.868 --> 42:16.077
I don't remember.

42:16.119 --> 42:17.746
-Yeah, well you were--
-[Cali] Neither do I.

42:18.121 --> 42:19.622
[gentle music]

42:19.914 --> 42:22.375
[Oliver] Well, you know,
when you,

42:22.417 --> 42:25.253
when you get started, it'll
probably all come back to you.

42:27.255 --> 42:29.716
Yeah. Okay. Come on. Let's
go, get in the truck.

42:29.758 --> 42:30.091
Come on, Finn.

42:33.470 --> 42:34.763
How about you?

42:36.306 --> 42:39.893
Oh, yeah. No, I'm going to do
some yoga, breathing training.

42:39.934 --> 42:40.185
Get rid of all this stress.

42:42.270 --> 42:44.064
[clears throat] Um, speaking
of which, I know

42:44.105 --> 42:46.900
we're not supposed
to talk about this, but

42:46.941 --> 42:47.609
Derrick texted me from
the airport, said

42:47.650 --> 42:49.361
it looks pretty grim.

42:50.445 --> 42:51.404
Yeah, yeah.

42:51.446 --> 42:52.655
My supervisor called
and he said

42:52.697 --> 42:54.574
the weather's really bad
over the Atlantic, so

42:54.616 --> 42:56.826
you guys might be stuck here
through till Christmas.

42:57.786 --> 43:00.246
What? Um, no.

43:00.789 --> 43:03.458
No, I refuse to accept that.

43:04.709 --> 43:08.004
Do you want me to tell
the Sharpe's the weather report?

43:08.421 --> 43:09.798
So they can mentally prepare?

43:11.132 --> 43:12.467
No, not yet.

43:13.343 --> 43:16.012
I don't want to upset them
for potentially no reason.

43:16.054 --> 43:17.514
So yeah,

43:17.555 --> 43:20.642
I'd rather inundate them with
holiday merriment for now.

43:22.060 --> 43:23.436
Okay.

43:23.478 --> 43:24.270
Then I should probably go.

43:24.312 --> 43:25.438
-Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
-Okay.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.774
Nama-stay?

43:27.816 --> 43:28.817
Is that what they say?

43:29.109 --> 43:31.236
[curious music]

43:32.529 --> 43:35.281
[cheerful music]

43:38.910 --> 43:39.911
[sacks thud]

43:39.953 --> 43:41.621
Well. That's our latest batch.

43:41.663 --> 43:42.914
Are you ready to dig in?

43:42.956 --> 43:44.541
Oh, I think so.

43:44.582 --> 43:45.625
You get this much mail
all year long?

43:45.667 --> 43:47.335
Heavens, no.

43:47.377 --> 43:49.796
I manage by myself
11 months of the year.

43:49.838 --> 43:53.550
But December is a whole other
kettle of fish.

43:54.217 --> 43:57.095
Look, our postmark

43:57.137 --> 43:58.888
was designed by a local artist.

43:58.930 --> 44:03.059
And every Christmas it makes
a lot of kids very happy.

44:03.101 --> 44:04.227
Where's your brother?

44:04.269 --> 44:05.478
Oh, he's eating
candy in the office.

44:05.520 --> 44:07.439
Okay.

44:07.981 --> 44:09.315
Here's the scoop.

44:09.357 --> 44:11.276
We both know Santa can't
do all the work by himself.

44:11.317 --> 44:12.152
-Right?
-[Cali chuckles]

44:12.193 --> 44:13.653
So, parents

44:13.695 --> 44:15.113
send us their kids'
letters to Santa

44:15.155 --> 44:18.324
with a pre-written response
enclosed.

44:18.366 --> 44:19.451
We send them back,

44:19.492 --> 44:22.620
stamped with our postmark,
and presto,

44:22.662 --> 44:25.248
the kids have a card or a
letter from Christmas Island.

44:26.541 --> 44:28.877
Here's one.

44:29.210 --> 44:30.253
"Dear Santa,

44:30.295 --> 44:32.339
I've been good at school
all year long.

44:32.380 --> 44:33.340
Please bring me a bike.

44:33.381 --> 44:35.759
Thank you. Danny Shaw,
in state."

44:36.051 --> 44:38.219
And this is Santa's response.

44:39.220 --> 44:40.764
[gentle music]

44:41.139 --> 44:42.849
"Dear Danny,
congrats on your straight A's.

44:42.891 --> 44:46.061
Now you're on my nice list.
Merry Christmas from Santa."

44:46.311 --> 44:48.438
That's actually pretty cool.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.689
What's even cooler is
we get them

44:49.731 --> 44:52.233
from all over the world.

44:53.068 --> 44:53.568
Would you like to stamp it?

44:53.610 --> 44:55.528
Sure.

44:55.945 --> 44:56.654
-Just right there?
-Mh-hm.

44:57.739 --> 44:59.741
-[stamp thuds]
-[Jim chuckles] Perfect.

45:00.533 --> 45:02.369
Do you think you'll get
everything out in time?

45:02.410 --> 45:05.080
Oh, well, in order to get them
delivered by Christmas,

45:05.121 --> 45:07.374
we need to get them out
by December 23rd.

45:08.083 --> 45:08.708
-That's tomorrow.
-Yeah.

45:08.750 --> 45:10.460
We better get going.

45:10.502 --> 45:11.920
-Okay.
-Come on, Finn.

45:17.801 --> 45:20.220
[Thomas] That's great of your
dad to lend me some clothes.

45:20.720 --> 45:23.682
Didn't exactly plan on hauling
lobster traps when I packed

45:23.723 --> 45:24.724
on this vacation.

45:25.392 --> 45:26.393
I don't take you for somebody

45:26.434 --> 45:28.728
to shy away
from physical labour.

45:30.063 --> 45:31.314
Seems all the labour

45:31.356 --> 45:34.984
I do recently is punching
numbers into a computer.

45:35.026 --> 45:36.027
[traps rattle]

45:37.195 --> 45:38.780
Back when Helen
and I started the company,

45:39.197 --> 45:41.783
I built the first few shops,

45:41.991 --> 45:43.535
the design, electrical,

45:43.576 --> 45:45.370
even some of the plumbing.

45:46.579 --> 45:48.415
I miss it.

45:48.748 --> 45:50.583
But this.

45:52.752 --> 45:54.963
This is different.

45:55.588 --> 45:57.382
It's part of our heritage.

45:59.718 --> 46:04.931
Hey, how long has Kate
been flying for you?

46:05.682 --> 46:06.391
It's her first trip
with us. Why?

46:09.019 --> 46:12.522
-Just curious.
-Huh.

46:13.773 --> 46:15.233
We should probably
get back to it.

46:15.275 --> 46:16.651
Got a big tree to build

46:16.943 --> 46:18.319
[cheerful music]

46:21.698 --> 46:25.952
-[machine whirring]
-[cheerful music continues]

46:27.412 --> 46:28.955
[Maggie] Hot cocoa anyone?

46:29.622 --> 46:32.959
-[Finn] Sure.
-[Oliver] Here she is! Make way!

46:33.209 --> 46:34.252
Shane, give me a hand.

46:34.294 --> 46:35.337
Sure thing Uncle Oliver.
Yeah, here.

46:37.130 --> 46:38.006
[Oliver] Okay.

46:39.007 --> 46:40.550
Who wants to spruce
the spruce?

46:40.800 --> 46:42.052
Isn't it a fir?

46:42.093 --> 46:44.262
Making a fir fancy just
doesn't sound as catchy.

46:44.554 --> 46:46.973
Cali and Finn,
you're our guest.

46:47.015 --> 46:49.726
Why don't you put the first
ornaments on the tree?

46:49.768 --> 46:52.896
Okay. Although, like I said,
we usually have people

46:52.937 --> 46:54.314
for this, but, yeah.

46:54.356 --> 46:56.816
[Shane] I'm cool with whatever
the tree looks like.

46:56.858 --> 46:59.110
As long as the new
gaming system is under it.

46:59.152 --> 47:01.112
No spoilers
until Christmas morning.

47:01.154 --> 47:02.238
All right?

47:02.280 --> 47:04.824
Santa and
Mom's know best, right Helen?

47:06.993 --> 47:07.952
Yeah, whatever.

47:07.994 --> 47:09.079
Whatever Maggie says.

47:10.497 --> 47:13.249
Do you happen to know if
your mom had a rotary cutter?

47:13.291 --> 47:15.168
Maybe in her old sewing kit?

47:15.210 --> 47:17.420
I don't know,
other than that I'm sorry.

47:17.462 --> 47:17.921
-Okay.
-[Cali] What was that for?

47:17.962 --> 47:19.881
Oh, nothing.

47:19.923 --> 47:22.133
I'm just working on
a little thing to help

47:22.175 --> 47:23.843
repay the nice people
for taking us in.

47:25.011 --> 47:26.137
Thomas, you're back.

47:26.179 --> 47:27.597
Yeah,
I just dropped in at Jim's,

47:27.639 --> 47:30.975
but I thought I'd try to get an
internet signal here.

47:31.017 --> 47:33.478
-Dad.
-I'm kidding.

47:33.520 --> 47:36.064
Trust me,
the only energy I have left

47:36.106 --> 47:37.482
is for tree decorating.

47:37.524 --> 47:39.025
[Cali] Then why
don't you go next?

47:40.360 --> 47:41.403
If you insist.

47:41.444 --> 47:42.487
Hey, Mom. We'll take turns.

47:42.862 --> 47:43.780
Oh, um.

47:45.156 --> 47:46.574
Sweetheart, I am right
in the middle of something.

47:46.825 --> 47:49.703
[soft music]

47:50.161 --> 47:51.413
Okay, yeah. For sure.

47:55.583 --> 47:57.377
[Helen] Which one
did you put on? That one?

47:59.421 --> 48:01.506
[soft music continues]

48:03.675 --> 48:06.511
See, Mom? Relaxtion.
I knew you could do it.

48:06.886 --> 48:07.721
So funny.

48:08.972 --> 48:09.389
They look happy.

48:12.350 --> 48:14.102
-They do.
-Come on, kids, help us out.

48:14.394 --> 48:15.478
-Come here.
-[Thomas] Finn, Cali?

48:15.520 --> 48:16.855
Looks like your mission
of bringing them

48:16.896 --> 48:19.357
Christmas is succeeding.

48:19.399 --> 48:21.359
[Sharpe family chattering]

48:21.401 --> 48:23.570
You should probably lead
by example.

48:23.611 --> 48:26.906
[Sharpe family
continues chattering]

48:27.282 --> 48:28.533
Okay, all right. Yeah.

48:29.075 --> 48:30.910
[Helen] It's beautiful.

48:31.578 --> 48:33.413
How about right there?
How about that one?

48:36.916 --> 48:39.544
[soft music continues]

48:40.253 --> 48:44.090
-[Thomas and Helen laughing]
-[Thomas] Way to go, guys!

48:45.050 --> 48:46.760
[Kate] I love this.

48:47.844 --> 48:49.054
[Maggie] Isn't it
just beautiful?

48:49.095 --> 48:51.723
We for sure needed the help.

48:51.765 --> 48:53.266
If we would have
gotten this done,

48:53.308 --> 48:56.644
but it was just really special
to share this with everyone.

48:58.980 --> 49:01.733
Maybe we should have
one for ourselves next year?

49:01.775 --> 49:04.652
-What do you think?
-Oh, that would be cool.

49:06.654 --> 49:08.073
[Maggie] All right, guys,

49:08.114 --> 49:10.575
Christmas is about to begin.

49:12.285 --> 49:14.245
-[bright music]
-And it's Christmas.

49:14.496 --> 49:16.623
The star is on the tree.

49:19.959 --> 49:21.836
Oh, it's gorgeous.

49:22.504 --> 49:25.090
[all chattering]

49:25.131 --> 49:26.549
[Maggie] Don't be shy.

49:31.096 --> 49:31.971
[Maggie] Oh, I love this.

49:38.687 --> 49:38.728
Hey.

49:40.146 --> 49:41.439
-You okay?
-[Kate] Yeah.

49:42.023 --> 49:43.650
I just didn't
want to be a downer.

49:44.776 --> 49:47.612
Tree lighting reminds me of
my dad, so.

49:48.697 --> 49:49.948
Kind of ruined it for me.

49:59.499 --> 50:02.002
You know,

50:03.670 --> 50:05.296
while the storm is out there

50:05.338 --> 50:09.259
and the planes are
all grounded, I uh.

50:09.300 --> 50:11.177
I have nothing to do.

50:11.720 --> 50:14.097
As the boys say around here,

50:14.139 --> 50:15.557
"I'm at my leisure."

50:17.183 --> 50:19.769
-You are, are you?
-I am.

50:20.311 --> 50:21.354
[Kate] Wow, well.

50:21.396 --> 50:25.316
What are you going to do
with all this

50:25.358 --> 50:27.736
free time you have on
your hands?

50:29.612 --> 50:32.449
You could work
on your automotive skills.

50:32.490 --> 50:34.451
It's just a suggestion.

50:34.492 --> 50:36.119
It's tempting.
That's tempting.

50:36.161 --> 50:37.245
But why would I do that

50:37.287 --> 50:38.580
when I already
found a great mechanic?

50:40.373 --> 50:43.168
I am going
to work on another project

50:43.209 --> 50:45.045
called "Getting Christmas Back."

50:45.920 --> 50:48.048
For who?

50:49.382 --> 50:50.884
'Cause it's certainly
not for you.

50:51.468 --> 50:53.678
It's not for me. No, no.

50:54.054 --> 50:55.680
It's for you.

50:55.889 --> 50:58.767
[soft music]

51:00.393 --> 51:02.187
Oliver, that's
really sweet, but--

51:02.228 --> 51:04.981
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

51:05.023 --> 51:06.566
Don't do that.

51:07.984 --> 51:11.237
You are a guest here, okay?

51:12.322 --> 51:14.240
You have no choice
but to accept.

51:15.575 --> 51:17.577
Those are just
the rules of Christmas Island.

51:20.205 --> 51:21.956
I didn't make them.

51:23.833 --> 51:26.211
Well.

51:26.252 --> 51:27.837
If it's the rules.

51:32.842 --> 51:33.968
Okay.

51:34.219 --> 51:35.845
Okay.

51:43.395 --> 51:46.731
[gentle music]

51:47.440 --> 51:49.192
Okay, so you two are going help

51:49.234 --> 51:50.694
Jim at the post office again
today?

51:50.735 --> 51:52.696
Yes, and it is crunch time.

51:52.737 --> 51:54.864
If we don't get those cards and
letters done by today, there's

51:54.906 --> 51:57.200
no chance they'll make it
overnight for Christmas.

51:57.242 --> 51:58.660
So what are you going
to be doing, Mom?

51:59.661 --> 52:03.415
Oh, I have a project
to occupy my time.

52:03.456 --> 52:05.125
What kind of project?

52:05.166 --> 52:06.418
You'll see.

52:08.086 --> 52:08.962
Oh, don't look at me.

52:09.004 --> 52:10.296
I have no idea
what's going on.

52:10.338 --> 52:11.965
What about you, Kate?

52:12.007 --> 52:13.800
Well, I'll probably spend
the day refreshing

52:13.842 --> 52:16.678
the weather app on my phone,
and then maybe--

52:16.720 --> 52:17.721
-[door knocking]
-[Oliver] Children of the house?

52:17.762 --> 52:19.472
Come forth!

52:23.351 --> 52:25.061
Hello.

52:25.687 --> 52:26.646
Hello.

52:27.105 --> 52:29.232
What is happening right now?

52:29.274 --> 52:31.151
[in character voice]
I'm Belsnickel.

52:31.192 --> 52:33.528
Here to judge
the kids placed on

52:33.570 --> 52:35.447
Santa's list.

52:35.947 --> 52:36.906
Bels-who?

52:36.948 --> 52:39.117
Belsnickel! Of course.

52:39.701 --> 52:41.786
-Of course.
-I work for Santa.

52:42.287 --> 52:43.663
And if you can't correctly

52:43.705 --> 52:45.081
identify your visitor,
then you go

52:45.123 --> 52:48.126
straight on the naughty list.

52:48.668 --> 52:50.253
But I've been good all year!

52:50.295 --> 52:51.713
Yes, you have sweetheart.

52:51.755 --> 52:54.090
This is just a bit of fun,
I think.

52:55.383 --> 52:55.925
[Cali] Oliver, we know it's you.

52:55.967 --> 52:57.594
Who's Oliver?

53:00.805 --> 53:03.516
Okay. Okay. Congratulations.

53:03.558 --> 53:05.769
As your reward,

53:05.810 --> 53:07.062
-[exciting music]
-[sack thuds]

53:07.354 --> 53:08.813
Candy.

53:08.855 --> 53:09.939
-[Helen] Oh? For breakfast.
-[Thomas] Slow down, buddy.

53:09.981 --> 53:11.816
[Helen] Great.

53:11.858 --> 53:13.860
German settlers
brought the tradition.

53:14.652 --> 53:15.612
It's pretty good, eh?

53:15.653 --> 53:17.822
Yeah, [speaks German].

53:18.323 --> 53:20.116
Though, it's just
a little creepy.

53:20.158 --> 53:22.786
Okay, I have to get a pic
with you for my socials.

53:22.827 --> 53:23.912
Oh, okay.

53:23.953 --> 53:25.955
Maybe
this is just a family portrait?

53:25.997 --> 53:27.165
-Nah.
-No.

53:27.207 --> 53:28.792
Come on, Kate. You got to
be in the picture!

53:28.833 --> 53:29.542
-Okay.
-Yeah, come on, Kate.

53:32.045 --> 53:34.631
Let's all say, "Stranded
on Christmas Island."

53:35.590 --> 53:38.009
[all in unison] Stranded on
Christmas Island!

53:38.510 --> 53:39.969
-[camera shutters]
-Perfect.

53:40.011 --> 53:42.847
Great. Now we'll always
remember this.

53:43.515 --> 53:44.641
All right. Come on, guys.

53:44.683 --> 53:45.684
Mitts and hats time.

53:45.725 --> 53:46.726
Jim will be here any minute.

53:48.687 --> 53:51.564
It's a, it's good.

53:52.982 --> 53:55.276
Well, that was

53:55.318 --> 53:56.861
quite the performance.

53:57.278 --> 54:00.198
Does Belsnickel ave any other
houses to terrify tonight?

54:00.699 --> 54:02.575
Nope. No. I just visited Shane.

54:03.076 --> 54:04.703
-Mh-hm.
-Left him quaking in his boots.

54:04.744 --> 54:06.121
But, you know, this doesn't

54:06.162 --> 54:07.664
mean the Christmas Island
Christmas tour is over yet.

54:07.706 --> 54:11.042
Oh, well, I actually think
the Sharpe's are busy tonight.

54:11.084 --> 54:12.502
I don't wanna take up
any more of your day.

54:12.544 --> 54:14.671
Trust me,
this item is just for you.

54:15.880 --> 54:16.923
Just for me?

54:16.965 --> 54:18.216
Oh, yeah.
It's a Captain special.

54:19.509 --> 54:21.011
I want to take you somewhere

54:21.052 --> 54:21.553
as a surprise.

54:23.179 --> 54:24.514
Right. Yeah.

54:24.556 --> 54:26.599
I think I've been sufficiently
surprised for today.

54:27.308 --> 54:27.684
That's fair.

54:30.353 --> 54:31.187
[cheerful music]

54:31.229 --> 54:33.023
So are you going to tell

54:33.064 --> 54:33.648
me what we're doing?

54:35.400 --> 54:36.901
I would have thought you,
of all people,

54:36.943 --> 54:39.279
would like spontaneity,
whereas I like

54:39.320 --> 54:40.363
knowing things
ahead of time, I'm

54:40.405 --> 54:42.741
just playing to my audience.

54:45.994 --> 54:47.954
Next stop on the Christmas
Island

54:47.996 --> 54:49.581
Christmas tour.

54:51.916 --> 54:55.754
[jazz music]

54:56.546 --> 54:57.839
No.

54:59.382 --> 55:00.383
Are you crazy?

55:00.425 --> 55:03.678
This is for kids.
Look at this line.

55:03.720 --> 55:04.971
Everyone's going to
think I'm weird.

55:05.013 --> 55:06.139
[camera shutters]

55:06.473 --> 55:08.850
Oh, look. It's your turn.

55:09.601 --> 55:10.810
Ho, ho, ho!

55:10.852 --> 55:13.104
Who's
next to sit on Santa's lap?

55:13.772 --> 55:14.981
Tell Santa I say, "Hi."

55:19.277 --> 55:21.654
Okay. I'm going to sit here.

55:23.615 --> 55:24.824
Big smiles.

55:27.285 --> 55:29.245
-[phone camera shutters]
-[Santa] What's your name?

55:29.287 --> 55:30.914
Kate.

55:30.955 --> 55:32.707
So, Kate,

55:32.749 --> 55:34.668
have you been a good
adult this year?

55:37.796 --> 55:40.632
Yeah, you know, I try.

55:41.549 --> 55:42.676
Good.

55:43.927 --> 55:47.138
Do you want to tell Santa
your Christmas wish?

55:49.724 --> 55:50.767
We're seriously doing that?

55:54.688 --> 55:57.857
You know what?
Yeah, I do.

56:02.320 --> 56:04.656
Okay, come on.
You can tell me.

56:06.741 --> 56:07.784
What my wish was?

56:09.160 --> 56:10.370
No, no, no.

56:10.412 --> 56:11.830
I think that's
against the rules.

56:11.871 --> 56:15.291
And I'm pretty sure
my wish is between Santa and I.

56:16.626 --> 56:17.669
[Oliver scoffs]

56:18.586 --> 56:19.421
Just whisper it to me.

56:19.462 --> 56:20.630
I'm not going to tell anybody.

56:20.672 --> 56:23.049
Okay, who's the rule
breaker now?

56:28.304 --> 56:30.765
Is this what's next

56:30.807 --> 56:33.018
on the Christmas Island tour?

56:34.185 --> 56:35.353
You bet.

56:35.687 --> 56:37.022
[upbeat music]

56:38.356 --> 56:39.649
Lunch.

56:39.691 --> 56:41.026
You ever heard of that?

56:41.067 --> 56:42.277
[Donna] Hi, I've got seats for
you right here.

56:42.318 --> 56:44.195
All right. Thanks, Donna.

56:45.363 --> 56:47.032
[Oliver] How you doing, Donna?

56:47.073 --> 56:48.158
-[Donna] Good. How are you?
-Good.

56:48.199 --> 56:50.535
-This is my friend, Kate.
-[Donna] Oh, hi.

56:50.577 --> 56:52.829
-Kate, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

56:53.872 --> 56:55.915
[people chattering]

56:57.375 --> 56:58.835
Want to share a pizza?

56:59.836 --> 57:02.047
If I haven't
lost all your trust yet,

57:02.088 --> 57:04.090
I'd like to order us
something special.

57:05.508 --> 57:06.051
Okay?

57:06.092 --> 57:08.011
Okay.

57:08.053 --> 57:09.054
Donna, you know what to do.

57:09.095 --> 57:11.890
Oh, I sure do.

57:12.766 --> 57:14.726
[ambient upbeat music]

57:18.563 --> 57:21.733
So, do you want to tell
me about this fear of flying?

57:24.235 --> 57:27.280
Well, there's not really

57:27.322 --> 57:28.365
much to tell.

57:28.406 --> 57:30.367
I just don't,

57:30.408 --> 57:31.659
I don't love the idea

57:31.701 --> 57:32.744
of not having any control.

57:35.121 --> 57:37.874
You don't like not
having control?

57:39.042 --> 57:40.543
-[mimics mind exploding]
-Oh, that's funny.

57:40.585 --> 57:41.711
Very, very funny. I.

57:41.753 --> 57:42.712
I know.

57:43.046 --> 57:46.216
I went to university
in Halifax,

57:46.257 --> 57:49.135
and my mom got sick

57:49.177 --> 57:52.263
in senior year,

57:52.305 --> 57:53.223
so I came back home

57:53.264 --> 57:56.393
to take care of her, and

57:56.434 --> 57:58.353
I needed a job,

57:58.395 --> 58:00.271
which is how I ended up

58:00.313 --> 58:02.440
at the airport.

58:03.775 --> 58:04.901
Maybe you're right.

58:04.943 --> 58:06.319
Maybe I got a job
where I have some control

58:06.361 --> 58:09.239
because there was none of it
in the rest of my life.

58:12.325 --> 58:15.245
Or maybe you just made
a career of helping people

58:15.286 --> 58:17.288
because you saw
how much you helped your mom.

58:18.707 --> 58:20.667
I think it's sweet

58:20.709 --> 58:21.960
and honorable.

58:24.129 --> 58:27.549
Anyway,

58:27.590 --> 58:28.800
flying or leaving it all

58:28.842 --> 58:30.301
just didn't seem
to be in the cards anymore.

58:31.928 --> 58:34.264
I guess it became a little

58:34.305 --> 58:35.932
exaggerated.

58:40.854 --> 58:42.272
Can't imagine
sticking around in one place

58:42.313 --> 58:44.190
for very long.

58:44.899 --> 58:46.943
Because you get itchy feet

58:46.985 --> 58:48.319
or you don't like it?

58:50.655 --> 58:51.948
No.

58:52.866 --> 58:54.409
Just, after my dad died,

58:54.451 --> 58:55.827
I couldn't
wait to get to flight school.

58:57.996 --> 58:59.122
And then I think I've just
been in perpetual motion

58:59.164 --> 59:00.874
ever since.

59:03.501 --> 59:06.463
Well, Captain Kate Gabriel,

59:06.504 --> 59:08.381
[gentle music]

59:08.798 --> 59:09.841
I think you can pretty much

59:09.883 --> 59:11.843
go anywhere
and do anything you want.

59:13.470 --> 59:15.055
You have so many options.

59:16.973 --> 59:18.850
You just have to choose
what makes you happiest.

59:20.602 --> 59:21.561
Same.

59:21.603 --> 59:25.315
Okay, who is ready
for some festive

59:25.357 --> 59:25.857
flapjacks?

59:27.525 --> 59:28.943
[oliver chuckles]

59:28.985 --> 59:30.987
See, I design them
like little Santa's.

59:31.029 --> 59:32.530
[Oliver] You're the best, Donna.

59:33.365 --> 59:35.325
Wow, these are, these are
Santa flapjacks.

59:35.367 --> 59:37.327
Little Santas.

59:37.369 --> 59:39.162
Little, little Santas.

59:39.204 --> 59:40.497
So I'm not going to have to
eat two meals.

59:40.538 --> 59:42.832
No, I'm going to crush these.

59:42.874 --> 59:44.376
-Oh, yeah? Okay.
-Yeah.

59:45.960 --> 59:47.003
All right, let's try this.

59:49.422 --> 59:51.174
-[Oliver] Right.
-[Kate] These are really good.

59:51.216 --> 59:53.093
And how about the maple syrup?

59:53.134 --> 59:53.885
Yeah, this is the real stuff.

59:53.927 --> 59:55.845
Real Canadian maple syrup.

59:55.887 --> 59:57.389
-That's right.
-Mh-hm.

01:00:01.476 --> 01:00:01.893
[muffled] Do I have
something on my face?

01:00:02.644 --> 01:00:04.896
-[quirky music]
-No.

01:00:06.398 --> 01:00:07.399
No, you're perfect.

01:00:09.275 --> 01:00:10.402
[muffled] This was
a really good idea.

01:00:10.443 --> 01:00:12.278
[both laughing]

01:00:16.616 --> 01:00:19.160
[curious music]

01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:23.915
I don't get it.

01:00:23.957 --> 01:00:25.041
If the planes are
still grounded,

01:00:25.083 --> 01:00:26.251
none of this mail
is getting out.

01:00:26.292 --> 01:00:27.627
It's stuck like us.

01:00:27.669 --> 01:00:29.129
So what's the point
of finishing?

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:32.382
The point of any of this
is to spread joy.

01:00:32.424 --> 01:00:33.550
Pains me to think any child

01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:34.551
will have his letter unanswered.

01:00:34.968 --> 01:00:37.303
What about the storm?

01:00:37.345 --> 01:00:38.722
It can open up at any minute.

01:00:38.763 --> 01:00:39.806
You never know.

01:00:42.183 --> 01:00:42.684
-All right, kiddo.
-[envelopes thud]

01:00:44.519 --> 01:00:45.812
Right now,

01:00:45.854 --> 01:00:47.731
I choose to believe
in a Christmas miracle.

01:00:47.772 --> 01:00:51.651
And if you could join me
in that for just another hour

01:00:51.693 --> 01:00:54.070
and keep working, well,
that would be swell.

01:00:54.362 --> 01:00:56.865
-I can do that.
-Thank you.

01:00:59.034 --> 01:01:00.452
Weird.

01:01:00.493 --> 01:01:01.327
This one's from Finn.

01:01:01.369 --> 01:01:02.746
Did you help him with this?

01:01:03.079 --> 01:01:05.206
[Jim] No.

01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:10.211
"Dear Santa, my name is Finn
Sharpe, and I'm seven.

01:01:10.253 --> 01:01:11.171
This is my second letter.

01:01:11.212 --> 01:01:12.505
I hope that's okay.

01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:14.632
I heard you would
answer this time.

01:01:14.674 --> 01:01:16.843
For Christmas, please make--

01:01:18.303 --> 01:01:20.472
please make my big
sister like me better."

01:01:20.513 --> 01:01:22.223
[gentle music]

01:01:22.599 --> 01:01:23.308
Of course I like him.
I love him.

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.226
He's my little brother.

01:01:29.814 --> 01:01:33.443
-I guess sometimes, I--
-Ignore him?

01:01:34.736 --> 01:01:36.237
Yeah.

01:01:37.072 --> 01:01:38.615
I'm sure it's not intentional.

01:01:38.656 --> 01:01:40.700
No, it's even worse than that.

01:01:40.742 --> 01:01:42.535
Then I would tell my mom off
for doing exactly

01:01:42.577 --> 01:01:42.827
the same thing.

01:01:45.914 --> 01:01:48.124
Don't be too hard on yourself.

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:50.126
It happens to the
best of us, kiddo

01:01:50.418 --> 01:01:52.003
We get wrapped up in life.

01:01:52.796 --> 01:01:55.882
It's never too late
to make things right,

01:01:55.924 --> 01:01:57.425
especially at Christmas time.

01:01:57.801 --> 01:01:58.885
[phone chimes]

01:02:04.224 --> 01:02:06.059
[Jim] Oh, no.

01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:07.769
-What?
-It's from Oliver.

01:02:12.232 --> 01:02:14.818
"Dad, I know you still have
hundreds of postcards to get out

01:02:16.486 --> 01:02:17.487
but planes are still grounded.

01:02:17.529 --> 01:02:19.155
I'm sorry,
but none of it will be

01:02:19.197 --> 01:02:21.282
sent out on time.

01:02:21.908 --> 01:02:23.910
What are we going to do now?

01:02:25.161 --> 01:02:27.038
I don't know.

01:02:29.457 --> 01:02:31.084
I am going to play some funny

01:02:31.126 --> 01:02:32.252
Christmas videos
to cheer you up.

01:02:32.293 --> 01:02:34.504
We should just stay off
those websites.

01:02:34.796 --> 01:02:37.298
I'm 15. Social media is our
way of life.

01:02:40.802 --> 01:02:43.346
Wait,

01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:45.098
that's it!

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:47.809
-That's what?
-Your Christmas miracle!

01:02:51.479 --> 01:02:52.814
[Oliver] I hope my dad's okay.

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:55.817
He takes this time of year
very seriously.

01:02:57.736 --> 01:02:58.903
Like father, like son.

01:03:00.822 --> 01:03:02.824
I think it's sweet,

01:03:02.866 --> 01:03:04.534
how much he cares about them.

01:03:04.993 --> 01:03:07.912
Holidays, kids,
how much it means to them

01:03:07.954 --> 01:03:08.830
getting a card from Santa.

01:03:11.332 --> 01:03:12.834
You care, too.

01:03:15.295 --> 01:03:16.838
What? You do.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:19.799
Just think about what you're
doing for the Sharpe's.

01:03:19.841 --> 01:03:23.178
And don't say
it's just to secure your job.

01:03:24.637 --> 01:03:25.972
Initially it was, but now I just

01:03:26.014 --> 01:03:26.848
want them to have
a good Christmas.

01:03:27.557 --> 01:03:31.561
I thik they are.
I know I am.

01:03:33.188 --> 01:03:33.855
Same.

01:03:35.482 --> 01:03:36.983
Shockingly.

01:03:38.693 --> 01:03:40.403
In all seriousness, though,

01:03:40.445 --> 01:03:42.864
this has, um,

01:03:42.906 --> 01:03:44.741
meant a lot to me.

01:03:44.783 --> 01:03:45.617
I really feel like I've gotten

01:03:45.658 --> 01:03:47.369
to see Christmas Island.

01:03:48.244 --> 01:03:49.496
[Oliver] You see
that right there?

01:03:49.537 --> 01:03:53.083
A smile,
that makes me happy.

01:03:55.543 --> 01:03:58.380
[gentle music]

01:04:02.717 --> 01:04:04.678
-[car honks]
-[Cali] Hey, you two!

01:04:04.719 --> 01:04:05.887
There you are.

01:04:05.929 --> 01:04:07.013
We've been looking for
you guys for hours.

01:04:07.055 --> 01:04:09.015
-Get in!
-Tell 'em, Cali!

01:04:09.057 --> 01:04:10.392
I know what to do
with the Santa letters.

01:04:10.433 --> 01:04:11.643
[Cali] Come on!

01:04:11.685 --> 01:04:13.019
[upbeat music]

01:04:13.853 --> 01:04:14.813
[Oliver] Digital?

01:04:14.854 --> 01:04:15.563
I mean,
if the physical postcards

01:04:15.605 --> 01:04:16.690
can't get there in time--

01:04:16.731 --> 01:04:19.234
Then the online ones could.

01:04:19.275 --> 01:04:21.861
Exactly! After all, why be a
master of the socials

01:04:21.903 --> 01:04:23.613
if you can't use your powers
to do good.

01:04:23.655 --> 01:04:25.073
Solid point.

01:04:26.241 --> 01:04:28.993
But I'll need someone
to help me with the search.

01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:31.788
I can.

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:33.289
[Oliver] Yeah, so can I.

01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:34.040
-We could all help.
-[Helen][ I could help.

01:04:34.082 --> 01:04:34.749
[Finn] I can help, too!

01:04:34.791 --> 01:04:36.876
I am a master finder.

01:04:36.918 --> 01:04:39.212
-Oh. [chuckles]
-Okay, perfect.

01:04:39.254 --> 01:04:41.881
We do not have much time,
so let's get started.

01:04:41.923 --> 01:04:42.966
Okay.

01:04:44.426 --> 01:04:45.176
Let's spread some joy!

01:04:45.218 --> 01:04:46.761
[all chattering excitedly]

01:04:46.803 --> 01:04:49.222
* It's the sleigh bells ringing
ding-a-ling*

01:04:49.264 --> 01:04:51.725
* It's the choir singing,
"These Three Kings"*

01:04:51.766 --> 01:04:58.940
* Everybody's feeling happy*

01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:03.361
* It's Santa's jolly,
"Ho! Ho! Ho!"*

01:05:03.403 --> 01:05:06.865
* When the streets are
filling up with snow*

01:05:06.906 --> 01:05:11.661
* This is Christmas to me*

01:05:11.703 --> 01:05:13.788
-[Kate] I think we did good.
-[Oliver] I think we did great.

01:05:14.164 --> 01:05:15.749
I think Cali's
going to be able

01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:17.000
to get everything out
by Christmas Eve.

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:21.338
I guess Christmas wishes do
come true.

01:05:24.716 --> 01:05:27.052
I wished Oliver knew how
happy he made me this Christmas.

01:05:27.093 --> 01:05:29.721
[gentle music]

01:05:29.763 --> 01:05:31.306
What?

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:36.102
That was, that was my
wish to Santa.

01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.232
That was your wish?

01:05:41.775 --> 01:05:43.109
Mh-hm.

01:05:47.697 --> 01:05:52.327
[bright music]

01:06:01.086 --> 01:06:03.380
Turns out, I didn't even have
to tell Santa my wish.

01:06:03.838 --> 01:06:04.005
It came true.

01:06:09.678 --> 01:06:10.679
Goodnight, Oliver.

01:06:11.346 --> 01:06:12.389
Goodnight.

01:06:22.565 --> 01:06:26.277
[cheerful music]

01:06:43.253 --> 01:06:43.670
[phone chimes]

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:05.817
[phone chimes]

01:07:06.735 --> 01:07:11.823
-[phone chimes]
-[Kate chuckles]

01:07:11.865 --> 01:07:13.658
[Maggie] Make sure
your eyes are closed.

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.326
Why exactly are
we closing our eyes?

01:07:15.368 --> 01:07:17.328
I have no idea.

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:18.455
Mom told me to get you guys

01:07:18.496 --> 01:07:20.290
over here,
and I think she's losing it.

01:07:20.331 --> 01:07:21.458
[Helen] I'm right here.

01:07:21.499 --> 01:07:23.043
Don't! Keep them closed.

01:07:23.084 --> 01:07:24.377
Keep your eyes closed.
No peeking.

01:07:24.419 --> 01:07:25.670
I heard that.

01:07:25.712 --> 01:07:27.005
Hey, Mom, if you don't let me
open my eyes soon

01:07:27.047 --> 01:07:28.256
you're going to hear snoring.

01:07:28.548 --> 01:07:30.133
I don't mind, I love surprises.

01:07:30.675 --> 01:07:33.970
One more second.
No peeking! Please don't peek.

01:07:34.346 --> 01:07:36.389
Oh, okay.

01:07:36.765 --> 01:07:38.224
Open your eyes.

01:07:39.768 --> 01:07:40.727
[Maggie gasps]

01:07:42.228 --> 01:07:44.356
-Ta-da!
-Helen!

01:07:44.397 --> 01:07:46.191
You didn't! Is this one?

01:07:47.108 --> 01:07:47.650
I did.

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:50.987
They're for the Christmas
Eve party tonight.

01:07:51.821 --> 01:07:54.866
Did you design and make
three dresses in three days?

01:07:54.908 --> 01:07:58.870
Actually, four. I, uh.

01:07:58.912 --> 01:07:59.788
I made one for myself as well.

01:08:00.914 --> 01:08:03.708
-[Helen] Do you like them?
-[Kate] Yes.

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:05.960
They're beautiful.
Look at this!

01:08:06.002 --> 01:08:06.753
-[Maggie] I want to try mine on.
-[Kate] Me too.

01:08:09.923 --> 01:08:11.383
What about you, Cali?

01:08:11.424 --> 01:08:12.258
Do you like it?

01:08:13.551 --> 01:08:14.844
[bright music]

01:08:16.262 --> 01:08:17.889
[Cali] Thank you, Mom.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.016
[Thomas] What's going
on in here?

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.268
Hey, where'd this come from?

01:08:23.853 --> 01:08:25.230
Is this the secret project?

01:08:26.731 --> 01:08:28.983
Yep. It's just a one off.

01:08:29.025 --> 01:08:31.736
I am not going back
to designing.

01:08:31.778 --> 01:08:33.613
It was, uh.

01:08:33.655 --> 01:08:34.906
It was just for fun.

01:08:34.948 --> 01:08:37.409
But maybe you should.

01:08:38.118 --> 01:08:40.912
Look, I want you to be happy
at work, at home.

01:08:40.954 --> 01:08:43.289
And if it means that we need
to talk about restructuring

01:08:43.331 --> 01:08:44.708
so that you can

01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:47.085
do more of this, then
I'm open to that conversation.

01:08:47.127 --> 01:08:50.672
You know, we've worked so
hard to build our brand and

01:08:50.714 --> 01:08:51.381
I don't want to let you down.

01:08:51.423 --> 01:08:53.633
Let me down? Helen.

01:08:53.675 --> 01:08:55.677
We're a team, okay?

01:08:55.719 --> 01:08:56.344
We all need to be happy.

01:08:56.386 --> 01:08:59.264
You, me, the kids.

01:08:59.305 --> 01:09:00.306
Or none of this works.

01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:03.893
I love you.

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:04.853
I love you, too.

01:09:08.648 --> 01:09:09.858
Your dad and I

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:12.110
are so proud of you
for taking charge

01:09:12.152 --> 01:09:14.195
and rescuing Christmas
for all those kids.

01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:17.032
Thanks, guys. And I love it.

01:09:17.073 --> 01:09:18.199
I'm going to go try it on.

01:09:18.742 --> 01:09:19.951
[Helen chuckles]

01:09:20.827 --> 01:09:24.080
See? You do say the right
things to her.

01:09:24.748 --> 01:09:26.166
A lot.

01:09:28.835 --> 01:09:31.296
[festive jazz music]

01:09:44.517 --> 01:09:45.977
You made it, Captain.

01:09:48.355 --> 01:09:50.357
You look...

01:09:52.067 --> 01:09:54.652
Wow.

01:09:55.403 --> 01:09:57.447
Helen Sharpe
made dresses for all of us.

01:09:58.198 --> 01:09:59.616
I thought it might
be too much.

01:09:59.657 --> 01:10:01.576
You look stunning, Kate.

01:10:03.119 --> 01:10:04.371
Well.

01:10:04.412 --> 01:10:06.456
In that case,
you should probably institute

01:10:06.498 --> 01:10:09.376
formal wear
for all your festive events.

01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:11.044
That's brilliant.

01:10:11.086 --> 01:10:14.172
Maybe I bring that up at the
next town hall meeting, I could

01:10:14.214 --> 01:10:16.966
unseat Maggie as mayor
using that as my key platform.

01:10:17.008 --> 01:10:19.010
Well,
it is what the voters want.

01:10:19.886 --> 01:10:21.388
Just don't tell
Maggie I said that.

01:10:22.305 --> 01:10:23.515
[Kate chuckles]

01:10:23.556 --> 01:10:25.016
You clean up very well, too.

01:10:26.017 --> 01:10:27.644
It's no Belsnickel outfit.

01:10:27.686 --> 01:10:29.354
Well, I didn't want to

01:10:29.396 --> 01:10:30.980
overwhelm you twice.

01:10:31.022 --> 01:10:32.565
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:34.943
I think the lighting's
about to happen.

01:10:40.573 --> 01:10:41.908
Whoa.

01:10:47.414 --> 01:10:48.998
Whoa, that is awesome.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.001
Dad, did you really
build that tree?

01:10:51.418 --> 01:10:53.044
He sure did.

01:10:53.086 --> 01:10:53.920
I couldn't do it without him.

01:10:55.922 --> 01:10:56.923
You know,

01:10:56.965 --> 01:10:58.717
we should have one
just like that,

01:10:58.758 --> 01:10:59.676
next Christmas in our house.

01:10:59.718 --> 01:11:02.971
Oh, well,
we'll see about that,

01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:04.931
But I am happy
to have contributed.

01:11:06.641 --> 01:11:07.434
Hey, Finn.

01:11:07.475 --> 01:11:09.436
I have a message for you.

01:11:10.478 --> 01:11:12.564
Since you're already on
Christmas Island,

01:11:12.605 --> 01:11:14.566
Santa didn't need to send you
a digital postcard.

01:11:14.607 --> 01:11:17.318
So I have his reply
to your letter right here.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.612
What does it say?
What does it say?

01:11:21.698 --> 01:11:23.033
"Dear Finn,

01:11:23.074 --> 01:11:25.452
I wanted you to know
that I heard from your sister.

01:11:25.493 --> 01:11:27.787
Cali said I should tell you
that you're her best friend

01:11:27.829 --> 01:11:29.581
and that she loves
you very much.

01:11:29.622 --> 01:11:32.459
Merry Christmas. From Santa."

01:11:37.172 --> 01:11:39.716
[Maggie] Okay, everyone,
gather around please.

01:11:40.342 --> 01:11:42.177
The ceremony
is about to start.

01:11:42.802 --> 01:11:44.137
Thank you.

01:11:45.805 --> 01:11:49.059
Every year we place buoys

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.312
with the names of our fallen
sailors, on this tree

01:11:52.896 --> 01:11:55.398
to honour their memories

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:59.110
and to allow them to be part
of this Christmas celebration.

01:11:59.152 --> 01:12:02.197
And we do this
because there is nothing

01:12:02.238 --> 01:12:05.200
more important than family

01:12:05.241 --> 01:12:07.744
and community
during the holidays.

01:12:07.786 --> 01:12:10.163
I'd like to invite Donna
LeBlanc

01:12:10.205 --> 01:12:11.998
to put up the first buoy.

01:12:12.832 --> 01:12:15.126
[Donna] Merry Christmas,
Uncle Cy.

01:12:17.003 --> 01:12:17.337
Go ahead, kiddo.

01:12:17.879 --> 01:12:21.383
[gentle music]

01:12:30.517 --> 01:12:32.143
Miss you, Dad.

01:12:35.188 --> 01:12:38.525
[Maggie] Anyone else is
welcome to come up.

01:12:39.317 --> 01:12:41.820
Now for the lighting
of the tree.

01:12:41.861 --> 01:12:43.530
Dad, you want to do
the honours?

01:12:46.533 --> 01:12:48.034
Countdown, in

01:12:48.076 --> 01:12:51.705
[all in unison] three, two, one!

01:12:52.706 --> 01:12:56.376
[people cheering]

01:13:10.015 --> 01:13:11.850
[Kate] Amazing.

01:13:11.891 --> 01:13:13.560
Never gets old.

01:13:15.979 --> 01:13:18.273
Maybe we could

01:13:18.314 --> 01:13:20.400
have a dance
or two after dessert.

01:13:21.401 --> 01:13:23.069
Yeah.

01:13:24.571 --> 01:13:26.239
If I remember how.

01:13:29.868 --> 01:13:32.037
Maybe you could take a

01:13:32.078 --> 01:13:34.789
lesson or two from
copilot over there.

01:13:35.915 --> 01:13:37.709
[Kate chuckles] You've
got some moves.

01:13:37.751 --> 01:13:39.210
That's what you call them.

01:13:41.046 --> 01:13:42.130
[phone ringing]

01:13:42.172 --> 01:13:43.381
Oh, one second.

01:13:43.423 --> 01:13:45.091
This is Glen from the airport.

01:13:45.133 --> 01:13:46.092
Sorry. One second.

01:13:47.719 --> 01:13:49.262
Hello, Glen.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.352
Okay.

01:13:58.271 --> 01:14:00.732
Yeah, I'll relay the
information.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:02.108
All right, thanks.

01:14:06.112 --> 01:14:07.155
Something wrong?

01:14:08.865 --> 01:14:10.450
Not exactly.

01:14:11.785 --> 01:14:13.078
The weather is clear enough

01:14:13.119 --> 01:14:15.246
that a handful of planes
can take off tonight.

01:14:15.288 --> 01:14:17.624
If you act fast,
you can take one of the spots.

01:14:19.042 --> 01:14:21.836
Wow. Um.

01:14:23.046 --> 01:14:25.131
Okay, the Sharpe's
are going to be thrilled.

01:14:27.467 --> 01:14:28.593
[Kate clears throat] Helen.

01:14:28.635 --> 01:14:30.345
-Yeah?
-Come here.

01:14:31.388 --> 01:14:32.806
We just got a call
from the airport,

01:14:32.847 --> 01:14:34.599
and we've been cleared to fly.

01:14:34.641 --> 01:14:37.227
I think I can get you
to Switzerland by Christmas Day.

01:14:37.268 --> 01:14:39.270
You can have your vacation
as planned.

01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:42.649
Oh, I see, that's, um.

01:14:43.733 --> 01:14:45.610
That's great.

01:14:45.652 --> 01:14:47.904
We can make the Alpine pitch
after all.

01:14:47.946 --> 01:14:49.531
Yeah. I just need to get

01:14:49.572 --> 01:14:52.200
some paperwork
filed and talk to Derrick.

01:14:53.076 --> 01:14:55.078
Okay. Well, I guess we should

01:14:55.328 --> 01:14:57.622
hustle along and,

01:14:57.664 --> 01:15:00.667
and pack
and meet you at Jim's in hour?

01:15:00.917 --> 01:15:02.460
Sure.

01:15:02.836 --> 01:15:05.296
That's great.

01:15:07.632 --> 01:15:10.301
[gentle music]

01:15:12.887 --> 01:15:16.808
I didn't expect this
to happen.

01:15:17.851 --> 01:15:19.352
Neither did I.

01:15:20.812 --> 01:15:23.231
I'm sorry about our date.

01:15:23.732 --> 01:15:25.567
Take a rain check.

01:15:26.568 --> 01:15:27.652
Yeah.

01:15:29.946 --> 01:15:31.823
I should go.

01:15:31.865 --> 01:15:34.826
I want to say goodbye
to your sister and Shane.

01:15:34.868 --> 01:15:35.243
Yeah.

01:15:37.912 --> 01:15:38.872
Thank you.

01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:43.209
I won't forget any of this.

01:15:44.544 --> 01:15:46.212
Me neither.

01:15:49.716 --> 01:15:52.218
Merry Christmas, Kate.

01:15:54.137 --> 01:15:55.722
Merry Christmas, Oliver.

01:16:09.402 --> 01:16:10.987
[gentle music]

01:16:12.322 --> 01:16:14.032
Helen?

01:16:50.652 --> 01:16:53.446
It's safe to say

01:16:53.488 --> 01:16:55.490
that you officially saved
Christmas.

01:16:55.824 --> 01:16:57.200
And don't worry,

01:16:57.242 --> 01:16:58.868
Shane will get the rest
of the postcards out.

01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:59.494
Okay?

01:16:59.703 --> 01:17:01.538
Maybe you can adopt

01:17:01.579 --> 01:17:04.749
the digital postcard version
going forward.

01:17:04.791 --> 01:17:06.876
Only as an extra option, I mean.

01:17:07.585 --> 01:17:09.796
I'm going to miss you
and your brother.

01:17:09.838 --> 01:17:12.132
No, you won't.

01:17:12.173 --> 01:17:13.383
I created a social media
account for you,

01:17:13.425 --> 01:17:15.468
so you have no excuse
but to stay in touch.

01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:17.637
Okay. Fair deal.

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:21.016
I'll ask Shane for a lesson.

01:17:21.057 --> 01:17:24.686
Oh, that's that.

01:17:25.353 --> 01:17:26.980
And that's--

01:17:27.022 --> 01:17:28.481
Stop Tom, I told you
I won't take your money.

01:17:28.523 --> 01:17:30.900
No, I know.

01:17:30.942 --> 01:17:32.110
It's a donation
to the memorial fund, Jim.

01:17:34.195 --> 01:17:34.821
That's very generous

01:17:34.863 --> 01:17:36.281
of you, Thomas.

01:17:36.614 --> 01:17:39.075
I appreciate it.

01:17:39.117 --> 01:17:40.827
-Hi.
-Captain.

01:17:40.869 --> 01:17:41.995
-Where's your mom?
-Inside.

01:17:42.037 --> 01:17:43.371
Okay.

01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:54.049
She's a great girl.

01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:56.092
Yeah, she is.

01:17:57.469 --> 01:17:59.054
[Kate] Merry Christmas Eve,
Mrs. Sharpe.

01:18:02.182 --> 01:18:03.641
I thought you might like
a coffee to go.

01:18:03.683 --> 01:18:06.519
Caffeine delivery is outside
your job description, Kate.

01:18:07.062 --> 01:18:08.563
You have gone above
and beyond,

01:18:08.605 --> 01:18:10.273
and I don't know how
I'm ever going to thank you.

01:18:10.690 --> 01:18:12.859
Oh, I have really enjoyed

01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:16.196
spending time with your family
this Christmas. It's

01:18:16.237 --> 01:18:17.530
probably me
who should be thanking you.

01:18:19.741 --> 01:18:22.369
This trip has

01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:25.038
given more to my family
than we even knew we needed.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.457
So you're saying
I should strand my passengers

01:18:27.499 --> 01:18:28.583
in remote
coastal towns more often?

01:18:29.793 --> 01:18:32.087
No, that's not what I'm saying.
[chuckles]

01:18:33.963 --> 01:18:35.340
Thomas and I

01:18:35.382 --> 01:18:36.841
have talked about it,
and we would like to offer you

01:18:36.883 --> 01:18:40.053
the pilot position
permanently.

01:18:40.428 --> 01:18:41.221
And I insist you call me Helen.

01:18:44.224 --> 01:18:46.935
-Yes. Yes, Helen.
-Yes?

01:18:46.976 --> 01:18:48.228
Thank you. I accept.

01:18:49.104 --> 01:18:51.606
-Wonderful. Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:53.274
For everything.

01:18:57.946 --> 01:18:59.614
Thought I'd find you here.

01:19:03.785 --> 01:19:04.786
Everyone get off all right?

01:19:04.828 --> 01:19:06.746
Yeah, They just left
for the airport.

01:19:06.788 --> 01:19:08.164
But how are you doing?

01:19:09.124 --> 01:19:10.417
I'm fine.

01:19:10.458 --> 01:19:11.751
Yeah?

01:19:11.793 --> 01:19:13.128
I'm not happy they left.

01:19:15.505 --> 01:19:16.131
That she left.

01:19:19.259 --> 01:19:20.760
Not going to lie about it.

01:19:21.011 --> 01:19:24.014
Okay. So,

01:19:24.055 --> 01:19:24.764
why are you here

01:19:24.806 --> 01:19:27.642
and not at the airport?

01:19:28.309 --> 01:19:29.269
Because maybe that's

01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:30.729
where you should be?

01:19:31.187 --> 01:19:33.106
[hopeful music]

01:19:33.148 --> 01:19:35.775
Yeah. Yeah, I should
be at the airport.

01:19:37.027 --> 01:19:38.486
Why are you always right?

01:19:39.362 --> 01:19:42.532
Well, it's because
I'm the smart one.

01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:47.162
I am the mayor, after all.

01:19:47.787 --> 01:19:49.330
[hopeful music continues]

01:19:49.664 --> 01:19:52.625
[Helen] Well, next stop,

01:19:52.667 --> 01:19:54.210
Switzerland.

01:19:54.252 --> 01:19:56.171
Cool mountain air will be
so crisp this time of year.

01:19:56.629 --> 01:19:59.174
[Helen] And our skis have been
on the plane waiting for us.

01:20:01.176 --> 01:20:02.844
What is it?

01:20:02.886 --> 01:20:05.263
Oh, it's just.

01:20:05.305 --> 01:20:06.264
I'm really going to miss it
here.

01:20:07.682 --> 01:20:09.100
I know, honey

01:20:09.142 --> 01:20:11.019
but maybe you can video chat

01:20:11.061 --> 01:20:12.479
with everyone here
from Switzerland

01:20:12.896 --> 01:20:15.148
Besides, what's most important

01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:17.359
is that we are
all together, right?

01:20:17.776 --> 01:20:20.153
That's right. And hey, guys,
we can have just as much

01:20:20.195 --> 01:20:22.155
fun in Switzerland
as we did here.

01:20:22.197 --> 01:20:24.199
Yeah. If you say so.

01:20:24.866 --> 01:20:26.242
[gentle music]

01:20:27.702 --> 01:20:29.245
Mom, I don't want to go.

01:20:30.872 --> 01:20:32.207
I know, honey.

01:20:32.248 --> 01:20:33.833
Neither do I,

01:20:33.875 --> 01:20:34.542
but we're about to take off.

01:20:34.584 --> 01:20:36.711
It's too late.

01:20:39.172 --> 01:20:40.674
You all right, Captain?

01:20:40.715 --> 01:20:42.008
Yeah.

01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:45.095
Fine. Controls and radios?

01:20:45.136 --> 01:20:45.845
Checked and set.

01:20:45.887 --> 01:20:47.389
Control centre,

01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:49.307
this is three might Charlie
holding the runway one, over.

01:20:51.393 --> 01:20:54.354
[controller] Three might Charlie
you are cleared to taxi.

01:20:57.982 --> 01:20:59.567
Roger that, control centre.

01:21:02.987 --> 01:21:04.864
[Oliver] Three might Charlie,
this is controller,

01:21:04.906 --> 01:21:06.616
do you read me?

01:21:07.075 --> 01:21:08.910
Oliver, is that you?

01:21:09.911 --> 01:21:10.870
Couldn't let you leave

01:21:10.912 --> 01:21:12.747
without telling you
how I feel.

01:21:13.832 --> 01:21:15.250
Seriously?

01:21:15.291 --> 01:21:16.292
I'm very serious.

01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:19.754
[hopeful music]

01:21:21.172 --> 01:21:23.383
Tell control centre we have to
hold our flight plan.

01:21:24.092 --> 01:21:25.510
There's
someone I have to see.

01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:28.430
If you don't mind, I need to

01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:29.889
talk to Oliver
for a few seconds.

01:21:29.931 --> 01:21:31.057
[Thomas] Am I crazy to ask this?

01:21:31.099 --> 01:21:34.894
But should we stay on
Christmas Island

01:21:34.936 --> 01:21:35.979
through the New Year?

01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:36.896
Yes. Yes.

01:21:36.938 --> 01:21:38.732
Okay, well, then it's settled.

01:21:38.773 --> 01:21:39.774
I guess we're staying.

01:21:41.151 --> 01:21:42.861
-[Helen] And Kate?
-Yeah.

01:21:42.902 --> 01:21:43.945
Go get your Oliver.

01:21:44.404 --> 01:21:47.323
[bright music]

01:21:58.960 --> 01:21:59.753
I'm glad I caught you.

01:21:59.794 --> 01:22:01.671
I'm here.

01:22:02.464 --> 01:22:04.758
But I don't know how
any of this is going to work.

01:22:04.799 --> 01:22:05.425
Me neither.

01:22:06.968 --> 01:22:08.970
But I think I'm finally ready

01:22:09.012 --> 01:22:10.555
to get over my fear of flying.

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:14.559
Do you think you can help me
with that?

01:22:16.227 --> 01:22:17.687
I'll save you a seat.

01:22:24.486 --> 01:22:27.989
[bright music continues]

01:22:30.367 --> 01:22:31.826
[Helen cheering]

01:22:45.006 --> 01:22:48.510
[bright music continues]

01:22:56.142 --> 01:22:59.604
[bright music continues]
