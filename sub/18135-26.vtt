00:25.025 --> 00:26.058
MAN: Get out of here.

00:26.093 --> 00:27.959
(GROWLING)

00:27.994 --> 00:29.194
Look out.

00:34.935 --> 00:38.236
No mercy for the human slime,
my simian warriors.

00:38.271 --> 00:40.806
We take this world today.

00:40.841 --> 00:45.010
Fight! Fight for Gorilla City
and simian kind everywhere.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.912
STARGIRL:
That's a lot of gorillas.

00:46.947 --> 00:50.882
Specifics, Stargirl.
You are evaluating
an active threat to the UN.

00:50.917 --> 00:52.417
Oh, great.
(CHUCKLES)

00:52.452 --> 00:55.353
Okay, there are like
30 to 40 gorillas attacking

00:55.388 --> 00:57.322
the United Nations building
with ray guns.

00:57.357 --> 01:00.692
Probably minions of
that bad gorilla in
the jail files I had to read.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.428
-Gorilla Gropp or something.
-Grodd.

01:03.463 --> 01:05.697
Relax, Stargirl.
You are doing great.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.833
Remember, every leaguer
had a first day.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.334
Everything will be just fine.

01:09.369 --> 01:11.436
Tell that to the UN delegates
about to be abducted

01:11.471 --> 01:14.406
by a super intelligent
megalomaniacal gorilla.

01:14.441 --> 01:15.774
Remember your training.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.709
Be efficient. Ruthless.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.278
Neutralize your foe.

01:21.281 --> 01:22.781
And have fun.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.616
It's important
to enjoy your work.

01:27.888 --> 01:32.090
The puny humans are inferior
in both mind and body.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.460
We will crush them
beneath our feet.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.065
Hands.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.868
Crush beneath your hands,
because you have hands
on your feet.

01:45.338 --> 01:48.707
That's what you get
for fighting with
these peacekeepers.

01:49.476 --> 01:50.676
-(GRUNTS)
-Ah...

01:53.947 --> 01:55.280
Sorry, Batman.

01:55.315 --> 01:56.515
Apologize later.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.850
Situational awareness now.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.986
This is mostly just
a ride along, Stargirl.

02:01.021 --> 02:04.623
To see firsthand how
a couple of vets
handle a routine situation.

02:06.159 --> 02:07.392
Routine?

02:07.427 --> 02:09.961
The end of
human domination of Earth.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.263
You call this routine?

02:11.298 --> 02:13.332
I call it a light
morning workout.

02:15.268 --> 02:16.701
With no cardio.

02:16.736 --> 02:18.403
Execute caged heat.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.482
Yah.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.853
(SCREAMS)

02:34.888 --> 02:38.990
That was more fun than
a barrel of monkeys Grodd.
But now you're done.

02:39.025 --> 02:40.392
Done?

02:40.427 --> 02:42.894
Are you kidding me?

02:42.929 --> 02:44.062
Mr. Mxyzptlk.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.298
He's so cute!

02:47.067 --> 02:48.667
What's a mxy...

02:48.702 --> 02:53.471
How could you not know me?
You are breaking my heart.

02:53.506 --> 02:57.509
I thought you had memorized
all the Justice League
dossiers I gave you.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.277
I have been cramming
like crazy.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.214
I learned all about
the atomic guy with
two personalities,

03:02.249 --> 03:03.915
and backward talking
lady magician.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.418
But when I read
this guy's name on the file,

03:06.453 --> 03:08.286
I thought it was
just a typo.

03:08.321 --> 03:09.888
Hey, watch it, girl.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.224
I'm the funny one here.

03:13.827 --> 03:14.960
Don't underestimate him.

03:14.995 --> 03:18.230
Mxyzptlk is an alien imp
from the fifth dimension

03:18.265 --> 03:20.498
with powers
beyond our understanding,

03:20.533 --> 03:24.035
and a pathological desire
to create chaos.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.971
That's mischief.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.306
Mr. Bats in the belfry.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.574
Mischief.

03:29.609 --> 03:31.576
Let me give you an example.

03:31.611 --> 03:35.714
The only way to stop
his nonsense is to get him
to say his name backwards.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.616
Watch this, kid.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.025
(GROWLING)

03:47.060 --> 03:51.563
Hey mister, looks like
you are a little mxyed up.

03:52.265 --> 03:53.965
Mixed up!

03:54.000 --> 03:57.168
Say, that's not a bad idea.

03:57.203 --> 04:00.706
In fact, it sounds like fun.

04:08.048 --> 04:11.016
STARGIRL: Uh, hey,
what's up with my man hands.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.351
SUPERMAN: Great Scot!
I am in Batman's suit.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.153
(BATMAN'S VOICE)
Not just my suit, Superman.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.556
Mxyzptlk played
musical chairs with our minds.

04:18.591 --> 04:22.093
But we've still got to stop
those gorillas no matter what
condition we are in.

04:22.128 --> 04:24.296
(STARGIRL'S VOICE)
You don't have to
tell me twice.

04:25.732 --> 04:26.798
(SCREAMS)

04:26.833 --> 04:27.866
Stargirl.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.136
Oh, shoot. I forgot.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.470
No flying for me.

04:32.505 --> 04:33.538
(GROANS) Oh.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.373
Everything smarts.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.575
Even Batman's boots
are too tight.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.911
All right, let's see
how this thing works.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.047
Ah! Whoa!

04:44.150 --> 04:45.350
(GROANS)

04:47.020 --> 04:48.586
Not so fast, you.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.721
Ow.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.757
That hurt.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.395
Superman, are you okay?

04:58.031 --> 04:59.564
Ow, my hand.

05:00.166 --> 05:01.266
Sorry. Sorry.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.668
My bad.
(GIGGLES)

05:03.570 --> 05:05.437
My heat vision.
Shut it off.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.538
I don't know how.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.506
Think cold thoughts.

05:08.541 --> 05:10.408
Icicles, Minnesota.

05:10.443 --> 05:12.911
Batman's disapproving stare.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.714
If I knew it was going to be
this entertaining,

05:15.749 --> 05:19.117
I would have
sprung for the good seats.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.385
(GRUNTS)

05:21.888 --> 05:25.090
We can't let this body switch
throw us off our game.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.793
You seem to be doing fine
in my body.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.329
I have never relied
on superpowers, Stargirl.

05:31.364 --> 05:33.331
Only skill.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.233
I still know how to
throw a punch.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.902
Oh, argh.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.371
(LAUGHS)

05:39.406 --> 05:42.307
It appears the Justice League
is having an identity crisis.

05:42.342 --> 05:46.111
We will never have
a better opportunity
to crush them.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.813
Crush this, Grodd.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.715
How's this come off?

05:50.750 --> 05:51.750
Got it.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.953
Watch out for those bat bombs.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.087
They have a hair trigger.

05:56.122 --> 05:57.622
(GROANS)

05:57.657 --> 05:59.524
Good safety tip, Batman.

05:59.559 --> 06:02.627
This body switch
doesn't seem to have
diminished your effectiveness.

06:04.731 --> 06:05.897
I know.

06:05.932 --> 06:06.731
Isn't that great?

06:06.766 --> 06:09.467
I am so excited about it.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.569
Er...
Are you like, okay, Batman?

06:11.604 --> 06:13.138
Batman is used to fighting
multiple foes,

06:13.173 --> 06:15.874
but not with the volatile
emotions of a teenage girl.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.709
What's that
supposed to mean?

06:17.744 --> 06:20.145
Why is everyone
staring at me?

06:20.180 --> 06:25.884
I've waited a long time
for this victory, Batman,
Superman, whatever.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.552
You will have to wait
a bit longer, Grodd.

06:27.587 --> 06:29.721
Thanks to Batman's batarang.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.289
Missed.

06:31.324 --> 06:34.125
Well, there's an entire
bat arsenal on this belt
to take care of... Ah!

06:34.160 --> 06:35.460
Whoa...

06:36.463 --> 06:39.164
I think I have
super allergies.

06:42.502 --> 06:45.170
<i>Gesundheit.</i>
(LAUGHING)

06:47.006 --> 06:49.040
This is too much!

06:50.543 --> 06:53.111
I can't even...
I can't even...

06:54.147 --> 06:55.947
This isn't working.

06:55.982 --> 06:58.049
We got to deal with
Mxyzptlk before
we deal with Grodd's army.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.517
I think we should
call in the cavalry.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.419
We need backup.

07:01.454 --> 07:03.455
Firestorm especially.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.656
But won't Mxyzptlk just...

07:04.691 --> 07:06.424
Excellent, Stargirl.

07:06.459 --> 07:10.628
Batman to Justice League.
Send Bravo Squad
to my location.

07:10.663 --> 07:11.830
Bring Firestorm.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.732
Repeat. Bring Firestorm...

07:14.434 --> 07:15.634
(GRUNTS)

07:17.136 --> 07:18.536
You have lost.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.271
The world is ours.

07:20.306 --> 07:21.640
Ready.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.777
Aim.

07:28.915 --> 07:29.948
Hey, Grodd.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.950
Where does
an 800 pound gorilla sit?

07:31.985 --> 07:34.953
Answer, anywhere
the Justice League
tells him to, yo.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.821
I don't mean to toot my horn,
but I'm gonna toot it.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.557
That was a pretty
gangster hero
arrival line, huh?

07:39.592 --> 07:42.393
-Dr. Stein.
-Ronald.

07:42.428 --> 07:44.929
I believe we have discussed
how your grandstanding

07:44.964 --> 07:47.899
exacerbates your
acute narcissism.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.969
I won't let you heroes
spoil the fun.

07:51.004 --> 07:55.874
Say hello to The Big Wheel
of Body Switching.

07:55.909 --> 08:02.280
Get ready. And remember,
this is only an exhibition,
not a competition.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.449
Please, no wagering.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.560

08:30.143 --> 08:31.142
Whoa.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.816
Whoa...

I am Shazam.

No, I am Shazam.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.167
(SCREAMING)

08:59.172 --> 09:00.371
This is a disaster.

09:00.406 --> 09:03.074
Yes. For Mr. Mxyzptlk.

09:03.109 --> 09:04.375
Observe.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.911
Oh, this is rich.

09:06.946 --> 09:10.048
I can play this game
for millennia.

09:10.083 --> 09:13.051

09:13.086 --> 09:14.252

09:14.287 --> 09:15.853
Hmm, interesting.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.723
Inappropriate laughter can be
a symptom of hypomania...

09:18.758 --> 09:20.491
What?
Who said that?

09:20.526 --> 09:22.660
I did. Dr. Martin Stein.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.762
One half
of the hero Firestorm.

09:24.797 --> 09:27.031
How did you get in my head?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.666
Get out of here!

09:28.701 --> 09:32.770
Oh, you are
an anthropophomaniac.
That's fear of other people.

09:32.805 --> 09:34.672
I begin to understand you.

09:34.707 --> 09:37.141
What are you?
The ghost of my shrinks?

09:37.176 --> 09:39.077
Stop psychoanalyzing me.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.946
You sound like
a hallunologophogomaniac.

09:41.981 --> 09:45.149
That's one who fears complex
scientific terminology.

09:45.184 --> 09:48.753
Stop! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

09:48.788 --> 09:50.355
Or perhaps
you are akiltensystem.

-Get this through your head.

09:53.292 --> 09:55.727
I am not a hypomaniac,

Ah.

10:14.847 --> 10:16.347
Now, my legions.

than usual, Ronald?

10:29.095 --> 10:30.261
Oh...

10:37.403 --> 10:40.271
Stargirl, I just wanted to
commend you on your
quick thinking.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.874
Knowing that Firestorm
was a dual personality,

10:42.909 --> 10:45.777
you surmised that
the additional consciousness

10:45.812 --> 10:49.313
would make its way into
Mxyzptlk's head.

10:49.348 --> 10:51.549
Good job, rookie.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.484
That wasn't
actually your plan.

10:53.519 --> 10:54.786
Was it?

10:54.821 --> 10:57.088
Frankly, I kind of wanted
to meet him.
