WEBVTT

00:00.027 --> 00:03.222
"Shades of Blue"...
I told you a corrupt politician

00:03.247 --> 00:05.925
was gonna come to you asking
you to let the mobster walk.

00:05.927 --> 00:07.623
You and your dirty cops
were walking around

00:07.648 --> 00:09.423
breathing free air because you agreed

00:09.448 --> 00:10.514
to deliver that politician.

00:10.516 --> 00:12.750
- You paid him to go away?
- Yeah.

00:12.752 --> 00:14.251
I'm gonna give you
the money I promised you

00:14.253 --> 00:16.654
and you're gonna disappear.

00:16.656 --> 00:19.356
Her daughter died from a drug overdose

00:19.358 --> 00:21.692
right after we had a fight.

00:21.694 --> 00:23.327
Was Donnie the first one?

00:23.329 --> 00:28.098
Tom Verco, Internal Affairs.
Keep up the good work.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.500
I think you're the fall guy.

00:29.502 --> 00:30.467
You can play all the mind
games you want.

00:30.469 --> 00:32.383
Doesn't change the fact
that I'm a good cop.

00:32.384 --> 00:34.104
Are you a clean one? Drug test.

00:34.106 --> 00:36.707
If you tap long enough, you will
always find a weak spot.

00:36.709 --> 00:39.234
How else do you think
I found your freezer?

00:39.236 --> 00:41.968
- Do I know you?
- Your dad hired his law firm

00:41.970 --> 00:43.953
to force your mom to let you see us.

00:43.978 --> 00:46.778
Terrence Linklater,
the ghost who masterminded

00:46.780 --> 00:48.847
the armored car heist.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.216
We stick to the assignment. Julia Ayres.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.050
She got my partner killed.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.586
I suggest you get rid of the body.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.372
How did we end up here, Woz?

01:13.374 --> 01:16.208
Practice. And your friend Stahl.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.644
You should have let me
do the world a favor

01:18.646 --> 01:20.612
and dispose of that psychopath

01:20.614 --> 01:23.512
when I had my hands
wrapped around his neck.

01:23.537 --> 01:25.270
Yeah, life in Leavenworth

01:25.272 --> 01:27.339
for killing a federal agent
is not a way out.

01:27.341 --> 01:29.274
I don't know,
an eight-by-ten is sounding

01:29.276 --> 01:30.709
very appealing right now.

01:30.711 --> 01:32.678
- Or we could talk to Julia.
- No.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.213
Find out if there's any truth
to what Stahl told us.

01:35.215 --> 01:37.249
- I said no.
- Finally get ahead

01:37.251 --> 01:38.717
of this thing or at least talk to him

01:38.719 --> 01:40.452
so we can understand
what we're dealing with.

01:40.454 --> 01:42.554
There's nothing to understand.

01:42.556 --> 01:45.290
And you're willing to bet
your freedom on that?

01:45.292 --> 01:46.892
Everything you've worked for?

01:46.894 --> 01:49.374
Everyone who works for you?

01:51.165 --> 01:54.333
What are you doing up so early?

02:04.189 --> 02:06.178
Two teenage girls. Opiate overdose.

02:06.180 --> 02:08.894
One DOA, the other in full arrest.

02:09.070 --> 02:11.382
- How old?
- I don't know, 16 maybe?

02:11.407 --> 02:13.040
The paramedics have the scene.

02:13.042 --> 02:14.609
Anyone notify the families?

02:14.611 --> 02:16.277
No, we're still working on IDs.

02:16.279 --> 02:18.880
Tufo and Espada responded to
a 5:00 a.m. noise complaint

02:18.882 --> 02:19.680
from our guys at the bakery.

02:19.682 --> 02:21.616
They knocked on the apartment door,

02:21.618 --> 02:22.858
the kids flew out like roaches.

02:23.419 --> 02:24.852
And no one bothered
to call an ambulance?

02:24.854 --> 02:26.687
We wouldn't have even noticed
the victims

02:26.689 --> 02:28.674
had we not done a sweep.

02:29.659 --> 02:31.726
Woz, we got all hands on deck,
you don't need to...

02:31.728 --> 02:33.873
Canvass the area.

02:34.829 --> 02:36.197
It would be admitting weakness.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.665
It's more of a compulsion.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.567
As if reliving his daughter's suicide,

02:39.569 --> 02:41.035
he could save her this time.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.338
Well, you go home, change.
Go hug your own.

02:44.340 --> 02:45.874
We got him.

02:47.329 --> 02:48.676
Go.

03:21.997 --> 03:24.498
Buckets of stupid for a Tuesday.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.573
It's hard when they're so young.
No drivers' license.

03:28.337 --> 03:30.504
Looks like pharma was their poison.

03:30.506 --> 03:31.738
It's labeled Oxy.

03:31.740 --> 03:34.388
Loman's over there
sweating the rave host.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.713
Get a confession?

03:39.715 --> 03:43.149
Names of kids at the party.
I'll check social media.

03:43.719 --> 03:46.451
Underage drinking, drug abuse.

03:46.505 --> 03:48.951
Your roof. Your responsibility.

03:48.953 --> 03:51.041
I told him, I just invited
a couple of friends over

03:51.043 --> 03:53.076
- to kick off Ditch Day.
- Ditch Day?

03:53.078 --> 03:55.944
A tradition. Kids at my school
do it this week every year.

03:55.946 --> 03:58.248
We post a few pics
and the party blew up.

03:58.250 --> 04:00.120
Things got out of hand.

04:00.586 --> 04:01.985
I didn't know half the people.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.348
Those girls brought whatever they took.

04:08.460 --> 04:09.573
Lieutenant?

04:10.260 --> 04:11.507
Lieutenant?

04:13.632 --> 04:15.699
Thought you had a late bell today.

04:15.701 --> 04:16.800
Added rehearsal.

04:16.802 --> 04:19.819
When did it become a crime
to get to school early?

04:20.272 --> 04:22.673
I just wanted to be here
before you woke up.

04:22.675 --> 04:24.608
I can make my own breakfast, Mom.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.986
Cereal al dente.

04:28.804 --> 04:30.124
Roll out was that bad last night?

04:33.484 --> 04:34.890
Sorry.

04:35.979 --> 04:39.523
Sometimes it's just hard to keep
work outside the door.

04:39.914 --> 04:42.014
You don't have to. I get it.

04:44.178 --> 04:46.820
Cop jargon, keen observational skills.

04:46.822 --> 04:50.060
Be careful. Uncle Woz might
put you on a stakeout.

04:53.237 --> 04:55.313
Mom, what is that? What?

04:55.647 --> 04:57.781
You have blood on your neck.
Did you get hurt?

04:57.783 --> 04:59.516
No.

04:59.518 --> 05:01.352
No, somebody else did.

05:03.062 --> 05:04.911
Way before we got there.

05:06.183 --> 05:07.557
You know what?

05:07.559 --> 05:09.187
I'm gonna stay home until second bell.

05:09.212 --> 05:10.845
- I'll take the demerit.
- No, no demerit.

05:10.847 --> 05:12.881
- Just go to rehearsal.
- I can skip.

05:12.883 --> 05:14.049
I totally know my part.

05:14.051 --> 05:15.984
Well, I'm still learning mine, so...

05:15.986 --> 05:17.819
I think you got it covered.

05:17.821 --> 05:20.849
I'm just gonna take a shower
and rush back.

05:22.359 --> 05:25.107
I love you, all right?

05:25.109 --> 05:27.289
Just go make beautiful music.

05:27.764 --> 05:29.831
The city really needs it today.

05:40.577 --> 05:42.777
Morning, Detective.

05:43.462 --> 05:46.381
How many more bodies
can your conscience carry?

05:46.383 --> 05:47.983
Because I've hit max.

05:47.985 --> 05:49.584
Don't mistake me for a priest, Harlee.

05:49.586 --> 05:51.086
And you're a free woman now.

05:51.088 --> 05:52.020
Just don't get into any trouble.

05:52.022 --> 05:54.923
What? Like summarily executing
a suspect?

05:54.925 --> 05:56.250
We at the Bureau are precluded

05:56.252 --> 05:57.692
from discussing ongoing investigations.

05:57.694 --> 05:59.894
Now you're going to read
me the manual after last night?

05:59.896 --> 06:01.763
What happened last night?
Did you have a nightmare?

06:01.765 --> 06:04.899
Yeah. I was caught
in a twisted vengeance quest.

06:04.901 --> 06:06.901
I had to make sure
Wozniak got the message

06:06.903 --> 06:08.636
and started to take me seriously.

06:08.638 --> 06:11.339
So this isn't about your dead partner?

06:11.341 --> 06:13.819
Is there even a dead partner?

06:15.049 --> 06:17.078
Found in a car. Shot in the head,

06:17.080 --> 06:20.048
and the heart, with his tongue cut out.

06:20.050 --> 06:22.259
Because of Julia Ayres.

06:23.746 --> 06:25.471
You look a little worn out, Harlee.

06:25.473 --> 06:27.088
Why don't you come on up?
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

06:27.090 --> 06:29.700
Maybe you'll learn a thing
or two about your precinct.

06:33.330 --> 06:37.524
Add drug trafficking to death and taxes.

06:37.549 --> 06:41.253
The choices are
willful ignorance or regulation.

06:41.278 --> 06:43.478
Wait, I don't get it. So you
let certain dealers operate?

06:43.480 --> 06:45.380
We control who, what, and where.

06:45.382 --> 06:48.316
But when a 16-year-old girl
doesn't make it to 17,

06:48.318 --> 06:49.951
somebody's not following the rules.

06:49.953 --> 06:52.353
I want you to smack this guy
square in the face

06:52.355 --> 06:55.757
when I give you the signal.

06:55.759 --> 06:57.625
Lieutenant Wozniak.
I was starting to think

06:57.627 --> 07:00.128
- you took early retirement.
- You're gonna wish I had.

07:00.130 --> 07:02.097
- Who's this guy?
- A disgruntled customer.

07:02.099 --> 07:03.898
Yo, I can't leave
with a half moon in my head.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.922
- Get a hat.
- Get out!

07:07.037 --> 07:09.637
I have a phone, you know.
I could give you my digits.

07:09.639 --> 07:11.005
Did you forget our arrangement?

07:11.007 --> 07:14.843
No slinging near schools.
And absolutely no minors.

07:14.845 --> 07:16.678
That rock you were under
must have bumped your head.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.280
Fentanyl sold as OxyContin.

07:19.282 --> 07:22.750
One girl's in the morgue,
the other's in ICU.

07:23.236 --> 07:25.303
It ain't mine and it ain't new.

07:25.305 --> 07:27.706
Been floating around two weeks now.

07:27.708 --> 07:28.873
Loman?

07:28.875 --> 07:32.611
- Yeah.
- Yo, I respect your rules.

07:32.613 --> 07:35.013
But while you were sleeping,
these guys showed up,

07:35.015 --> 07:36.881
the import the Fentanyl from China,

07:36.883 --> 07:39.517
recut it, and sell it at 300% profit.

07:39.519 --> 07:40.986
They never got your playbook.

07:40.988 --> 07:42.621
Well, where do I send it?

07:42.623 --> 07:43.655
Do I look like your CI?

07:43.657 --> 07:46.391
You want to control flow,
you gotta stick around.

07:46.393 --> 07:47.393
We've had out hands full.

07:48.595 --> 07:50.528
The other brother you had was scarier.

07:50.530 --> 07:54.332
Loman, give Devonte a new look.

07:54.334 --> 07:56.372
Something scarier.

07:56.446 --> 07:59.347
Relax, kid. I'm just messing.

07:59.349 --> 08:01.783
And it ain't my problem
if some hopped up gumby

08:01.785 --> 08:03.117
pushes into your safe zone.

08:03.119 --> 08:05.820
It takes a village. Hey, come here.

08:05.822 --> 08:09.691
Now, speak. Talk!

08:09.693 --> 08:13.528
Word is they work a route
at the bodega near 14th Street.

08:13.530 --> 08:15.196
This is a gentle reminder.

08:15.198 --> 08:18.466
My problems are your problems.

08:25.066 --> 08:28.935
Before I developed a taste
for corrupt cops,

08:28.937 --> 08:32.539
I managed operatives for more
traditional criminal syndicates.

08:32.541 --> 08:33.907
Those who can't dance, handle.

08:33.909 --> 08:36.982
Well, I didn't exactly fit the profile

08:36.985 --> 08:39.645
for this particular line
of undercover work, Harlee.

08:39.648 --> 08:42.381
Take a seat. I won't be staying.

08:42.384 --> 08:44.116
Okay.

08:44.119 --> 08:46.853
My partner got cold feet

08:47.324 --> 08:49.689
for months into penetrating
Bianchi's mob syndicate.

08:49.691 --> 08:53.309
Constant pressure, paranoia, you know.

08:53.311 --> 08:55.017
It was your job to talk him down?

08:55.057 --> 08:56.323
I got his head back in the game.

08:56.325 --> 09:00.527
And then I briefed a Brooklyn
Community Crime Initiative Board

09:00.529 --> 09:02.475
and there was this certain councilwoman,

09:02.477 --> 09:04.445
an ex-cop, real law and order type,

09:04.470 --> 09:06.707
kept probing me on my inside guy.

09:07.473 --> 09:10.407
And two weeks later,
his widow got a flag.

09:10.409 --> 09:11.942
And I got a transfer.

09:11.944 --> 09:13.718
You gave up an undercover's identity?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.524
Not his name, no.

09:17.950 --> 09:19.383
All she needed was confirmation

09:19.385 --> 09:22.368
that we had infiltrated
Bianchi's organization.

09:23.022 --> 09:25.222
It doesn't mean Julia fingered him.

09:25.507 --> 09:27.858
You gotta separate personal loss
from circumstance.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.827
Well, sometimes a struggle is so primal

09:29.829 --> 09:32.972
we're compelled to take justice
into our own hands.

09:34.381 --> 09:36.308
Don't you agree?

09:37.837 --> 09:40.170
Are you sure that it's justice
you're seeking?

09:40.172 --> 09:42.740
I know what I want, Harlee,
and what I expect,

09:42.742 --> 09:44.274
and by now I think you'd realize

09:44.276 --> 09:45.764
how committed I am to getting it.

09:46.709 --> 09:49.043
Then let me give you what you want.

09:50.275 --> 09:52.616
There's a reason that Julia
trusts Wozniak.

09:52.618 --> 09:55.264
He doesn't see her the way you do.

09:55.266 --> 09:56.488
Yeah.

09:58.356 --> 09:59.920
How do you see her?

10:01.817 --> 10:04.728
Julia was in my unit.
I put my life in her hands.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.660
But if you're right, if she's changed,

10:07.944 --> 10:10.452
give me a lead so I can see for myself

10:11.232 --> 10:12.542
and convince Wozniak.

10:12.594 --> 10:15.829
Well, Harlee, you know
that I can't explicitly

10:15.831 --> 10:18.965
divulge information regarding
on ongoing FBI investigation.

10:18.967 --> 10:21.067
I can't. But you have a badge,

10:21.069 --> 10:23.770
and you're not my asset anymore.

10:23.772 --> 10:26.806
Campaign contributions
are a matter of public record.

10:26.808 --> 10:29.876
I can't stop you from looking
into your own backyard

10:29.878 --> 10:32.846
or into your own unit's associations.

10:32.848 --> 10:34.581
Perhaps a direct connection

10:34.583 --> 10:36.049
between a certain elected official

10:36.051 --> 10:39.319
and a mafia money-laundering
front can be proven.

10:41.723 --> 10:44.596
Or a conspiracy put to rest.

10:57.339 --> 10:59.993
Incoming call
on your William Clark line.

10:59.995 --> 11:02.342
Put her through to my cell.

11:03.305 --> 11:04.520
Hello?

11:04.545 --> 11:06.378
Hi, this is Cristina Santos.

11:06.380 --> 11:09.381
I'm Miguel Zepeda's daughter.
I met you at my grandmother's.

11:09.383 --> 11:12.662
Right, right, the musician.
Of course I remember.

11:12.687 --> 11:14.247
I had some questions, and,

11:14.249 --> 11:16.789
well, I was thinking maybe
I could, you know,

11:16.791 --> 11:19.859
help you with information
to track down my dad.

11:19.861 --> 11:21.927
If you have time, at some point,

11:21.929 --> 11:23.996
maybe we could meet up today.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.833
Absolutely.

11:27.835 --> 11:30.757
That... Cristina,
it would be my pleasure.

11:35.479 --> 11:37.245
Tox screen confirms Fentanyl

11:37.247 --> 11:39.147
and they were able to stabilize her.

11:39.149 --> 11:41.049
She's unconscious, but we got an ID

11:41.051 --> 11:43.919
off of her swim team photo.
Straight A student.

11:43.921 --> 11:45.253
Her parents there yet?

11:45.255 --> 11:47.155
On a train back from an
overnight in Connecticut.

11:47.157 --> 11:48.924
It took some convincing
for them to believe

11:48.926 --> 11:50.125
that we had the right girl.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.561
Deep down, they knew.

11:52.563 --> 11:54.429
Stay there until they show.

11:54.431 --> 11:56.765
What for? It's a waiting game now.

11:56.767 --> 11:59.000
Hospitals are cold places.

11:59.002 --> 12:01.491
I don't want her there by herself.

12:08.249 --> 12:09.948
You just asked me to go get coffee.

12:09.950 --> 12:12.017
To make sure you don't have
a hearing problem.

12:12.019 --> 12:14.820
When I tell you
to do something, you do it.

12:14.822 --> 12:16.121
No hesitation.

12:16.123 --> 12:17.923
You talking about the barbershop?

12:17.925 --> 12:19.925
We have enough heat
from Internal Affairs

12:19.927 --> 12:20.859
on us right now.

12:20.861 --> 12:22.560
And the guy already gave us
what we needed.

12:22.562 --> 12:25.931
We control the streets
because they believe we do.

12:25.933 --> 12:30.560
If they stop believing,
it stops being true.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.040
Why did you pick me to be in this squad?

12:35.419 --> 12:36.808
What are you writing a memoir?

12:36.810 --> 12:40.412
I'm curious.
Of all the recruits, why me?

12:40.414 --> 12:43.715
I didn't pick you. You picked us.

12:43.717 --> 12:46.985
Nah. I heard that you hand
pick every member of your crew.

12:46.987 --> 12:49.054
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:49.056 --> 12:52.142
- And where'd you hear that?
- Internal Affairs.

12:53.219 --> 12:56.962
When you shot that drug dealer
playing video games,

12:56.964 --> 12:58.463
we saved you.

12:58.465 --> 13:01.032
When it came time to save us,

13:01.034 --> 13:03.268
you came through.

13:03.676 --> 13:05.804
That's how you get on this team.

13:06.365 --> 13:07.939
I'm barely spoken to as is.

13:07.941 --> 13:10.240
And when I am spoken to,
it's somebody telling me

13:10.265 --> 13:12.032
that I gotta punch somebody in the face.

13:12.034 --> 13:14.101
Or I gotta keep my mouth shut, Loman.

13:14.103 --> 13:16.670
Makes you wonder what my role
really is here, Woz.

13:16.672 --> 13:20.699
Your role is to stop leaving
dead bodies in your wake,

13:21.620 --> 13:25.112
keep your eyes open, and to get coffee.

13:31.129 --> 13:32.662
Inconclusive? What does that mean?

13:32.664 --> 13:34.330
I think it means not conclusive.

13:34.332 --> 13:36.165
Only you're conclusively on drugs.

13:36.167 --> 13:38.000
Can I remind you
that I was shot, Espada?

13:38.002 --> 13:39.702
Thank God for lab error.

13:39.704 --> 13:41.037
Who's side are you on anyways?

13:41.039 --> 13:42.104
Would you rather I got suspended?

13:42.106 --> 13:43.139
So what now?

13:43.141 --> 13:45.908
Internal Affairs gonna hand you
another pee cup?

13:45.910 --> 13:48.044
Think the whole concept
of random drug testing

13:48.046 --> 13:49.812
is you don't know when it's coming.

13:49.814 --> 13:51.213
You don't really believe that.

13:51.215 --> 13:53.115
Look, I'm better at this game
than Velcro,

13:53.117 --> 13:54.750
Verco, whatever his name is.

13:54.752 --> 13:57.320
I don't know. He seems pretty attached.

13:57.322 --> 13:59.121
I went painkiller free
last night, cold turkey.

13:59.123 --> 14:01.223
So aside from the five alarm
fire burning a hole

14:01.225 --> 14:02.692
through my shoulder, I'm good to go.

14:02.694 --> 14:04.994
Not if you don't button it up.

14:07.999 --> 14:11.485
A feel a wave of nausea coming on.

14:12.646 --> 14:14.437
Tess cleared an IA drug test?

14:14.439 --> 14:16.005
About time she caught a lucky break.

14:16.007 --> 14:18.007
She took the test yesterday?

14:18.009 --> 14:19.875
And they're not gonna follow up
with another test?

14:19.877 --> 14:22.812
Not for now. But the rat
squad's not done packing up yet.

14:22.814 --> 14:24.680
All the more reason
to keep our own house in order.

14:24.682 --> 14:26.081
Feel like doing a wellness check?

14:26.083 --> 14:27.321
Not the old lady on Fulton.

14:27.323 --> 14:28.749
There's never anybody
outside her window.

14:28.751 --> 14:30.449
No. This one's been under our protection

14:30.451 --> 14:31.758
for a couple of years.

14:32.690 --> 14:34.690
Terry running book out of the pool hall?

14:35.056 --> 14:36.489
I think Terry's upgraded.

14:36.491 --> 14:39.025
He's been making serious
political contributions

14:39.027 --> 14:40.560
over the past six months, all cash.

14:40.562 --> 14:42.929
Well, what are we looking at him for?

14:42.931 --> 14:44.597
I saw him driving a new Acura.

14:44.599 --> 14:46.299
You think he's tapped
a new revenue stream?

14:46.301 --> 14:48.896
I think we should know
what our connections are into,

14:48.898 --> 14:51.056
you know,
with Internal Affairs hovering.

14:51.081 --> 14:52.914
And approaching for landing.

14:52.916 --> 14:55.450
Crime lab fast-tracked
your drug analysis.

14:55.452 --> 14:58.052
Pills at the OD'd girls' scene,
counterfeit.

14:58.054 --> 15:00.054
Fentanyl repackaged as OxyContin.

15:00.056 --> 15:02.890
Harlee, do I look like this guy?

15:02.892 --> 15:04.926
More hair, better manners.

15:04.928 --> 15:07.228
'Cause I'm fairly confident
I requisitioned that analysis.

15:07.230 --> 15:09.263
Carlos Espada.

15:09.265 --> 15:11.399
Yeah? I find any piece of evidence

15:11.401 --> 15:12.834
with your names on it fascinating.

15:12.836 --> 15:15.036
Like the fact that dispatch sent patrol

15:15.038 --> 15:17.338
after your crew had already showed up.

15:17.340 --> 15:19.007
Bakery next door has Espada's card,

15:19.009 --> 15:20.708
- called him direct.
- Interesting again.

15:20.710 --> 15:23.444
There's no record of your crew
responding to that call.

15:23.446 --> 15:25.013
You guys have a real talent
for being the first

15:25.015 --> 15:26.414
to show up at crime scenes.

15:26.416 --> 15:28.714
You haven't tried their sticky buns.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.053
You know what I mean?

15:32.055 --> 15:33.454
I helped my abuela write up a list

15:33.456 --> 15:35.746
of my father's friends and relatives.

15:38.661 --> 15:40.428
You have a future as a detective.

15:40.430 --> 15:43.264
Not if I can help it.

15:43.266 --> 15:44.899
Well...

15:44.901 --> 15:46.990
look, the truth is, Cristina,

15:46.992 --> 15:49.356
I've run into a bit of a dead end here.

15:49.358 --> 15:52.573
My client, the law firm,
they've dropped the search.

15:52.999 --> 15:54.342
There's nothing I can do

15:54.344 --> 15:55.777
to convince you to continue looking?

15:55.779 --> 15:58.513
Maybe your mom can help with the search.

15:59.002 --> 16:00.835
Maybe hell will freeze over.

16:00.837 --> 16:02.537
You'd be surprised.

16:02.539 --> 16:05.473
Despite estrangements,
co-parents are bonded for life.

16:05.475 --> 16:08.136
And by you, in this case.

16:09.078 --> 16:11.245
So was he really looking to get custody?

16:11.247 --> 16:13.114
Fathers who want a relationship

16:13.116 --> 16:15.649
with their children never give up.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.721
What if they were offered
an entirely new life?

16:22.889 --> 16:26.561
Well, a new life would be very
hard to come by for an ex-con.

16:27.261 --> 16:28.782
What if he had a lot of cash?

16:29.327 --> 16:31.832
That would require a sizeable amount.

16:31.834 --> 16:33.434
Hard to acquire
without committing a crime,

16:33.436 --> 16:35.102
and that would leave a trace.

16:35.104 --> 16:38.813
Unless someone were to...
give it to him, right?

16:38.815 --> 16:41.654
Right, but then there's
a question of motive.

16:41.679 --> 16:43.746
Why would someone give him
that kind of cash

16:43.748 --> 16:45.581
and what would they expect in return?

16:45.583 --> 16:48.958
That he'd be out of our lives
without even saying good-bye.

16:49.987 --> 16:52.254
Yeah, yeah.

16:52.256 --> 16:53.455
Well, that... that was one
of the first things

16:53.457 --> 16:54.957
that caught my attention.

16:54.959 --> 16:57.720
He sent me a weirdo text.

16:58.429 --> 17:00.527
Didn't even really sound like him.

17:01.098 --> 17:02.973
He sent you a text?

17:03.957 --> 17:05.634
Can I see it?

17:12.473 --> 17:13.798
If Terry's suddenly flush,

17:13.800 --> 17:15.663
you'd think he could afford
a can of paint.

17:15.665 --> 17:16.896
So we turn him upside down

17:16.898 --> 17:19.155
and see what loose change falls out.

17:20.636 --> 17:23.236
Think Terry's into that much trouble?

17:24.215 --> 17:26.440
I think nobody likes to be shaken down.

17:34.450 --> 17:36.417
Thought you guys were out
of the game for a while.

17:36.419 --> 17:39.019
What, no hello? We missed you, Terry.

17:39.021 --> 17:42.623
Figured we'd come by, shoot a few racks.

17:42.625 --> 17:44.444
I'd tell you to put your hips into it,

17:44.446 --> 17:45.659
but that seems to come natural.

17:45.661 --> 17:47.628
We hear you're into
current events, Terry.

17:47.630 --> 17:50.164
Pouring money into city politics
like you're a Rockefeller.

17:50.166 --> 17:52.099
I'm a sucker for worthy causes.

17:52.101 --> 17:54.062
How much small book does it
take to cover

17:54.064 --> 17:56.971
- that tricked out Acura?
- What Acura?

17:58.074 --> 18:00.554
Foul. Respot.

18:01.611 --> 18:03.077
Gotta watch where you put those fingers.

18:03.079 --> 18:04.879
Terry, I forget,

18:04.881 --> 18:06.414
where do you keep your numbers' stash?

18:06.416 --> 18:09.525
Okay, my great aunt Sandy died.

18:09.527 --> 18:11.165
Crazy old bat didn't trust banks.

18:11.167 --> 18:12.987
They found a hundred G's
in the mattress.

18:12.989 --> 18:15.523
Jesus! Crazy bitch.

18:15.525 --> 18:17.734
Try again, Terry.

18:19.429 --> 18:21.095
I'm just a facilitator.

18:21.097 --> 18:24.021
Cash filters through the bar,
I let it happen.

18:24.046 --> 18:25.579
You don't say no to these guys.

18:25.581 --> 18:27.381
Look, I get it.

18:27.383 --> 18:28.749
All right, you needed cash,

18:28.751 --> 18:29.982
you got in with the wrong people.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.386
Tell us who they are
and we can protect you.

18:32.388 --> 18:33.553
Well, who's gonna protect you?

18:33.555 --> 18:36.623
Eight ball, corner pocket.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.558
As a friend, I'm telling you,

18:38.560 --> 18:40.460
forget the last five minutes
of your life

18:40.462 --> 18:41.628
and walk away. Trust me.

18:41.630 --> 18:44.231
There's gotta be 50 grand there.

18:44.233 --> 18:46.767
Tell your friends they can
claim this within 24 hours,

18:46.769 --> 18:48.702
or I give it to charity.

18:48.704 --> 18:51.805
You can tell them in person
when they catch up with you.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.652
You lost, sweetheart?

19:05.654 --> 19:08.588
Hey. 200s worth.

19:08.590 --> 19:10.285
200s worth of directions?

19:10.287 --> 19:12.726
How about directions to
someone who can help me score.

19:12.728 --> 19:13.960
Okay, all right, now we're talking.

19:13.962 --> 19:15.662
How much and of what?

19:15.664 --> 19:16.963
200, Oxy.

19:16.965 --> 19:18.981
I need a smile.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.538
Done.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.206
I'm not running a drive thru.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.308
You gotta step out to get served.

19:32.815 --> 19:34.815
You know, guys usually open
the door for me.

19:34.817 --> 19:36.817
I'm setting expectations
so you never say

19:36.819 --> 19:38.013
I don't treat you like I used to.

19:38.015 --> 19:39.538
That's charming.

19:40.122 --> 19:42.222
Slip the cash in that cup.

19:56.738 --> 19:59.539
Up against the car. Up against the car.

19:59.541 --> 20:01.608
What, you're not gonna smile for me?

20:01.610 --> 20:02.876
Come on, Skippy.

20:02.878 --> 20:05.745
It's a younger demo out there.
It might be smart to sympathize.

20:05.747 --> 20:06.847
And sympathize I do,

20:06.849 --> 20:08.782
but a "casualty" happens in a war.

20:08.784 --> 20:11.418
Let's go with "casualness"
and avoid contributing

20:11.420 --> 20:13.887
to the death of the English language.

20:13.889 --> 20:15.755
Julia.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.691
- Got a minute?
- Harlee?

20:17.693 --> 20:19.860
Unless you have a pitch
on affordable housing,

20:19.862 --> 20:21.361
this is a bad time.

20:21.363 --> 20:22.762
I thought that was an oxymoron
in this town.

20:22.764 --> 20:25.899
See if you can fit that in.
Type quickly.

20:25.901 --> 20:29.236
I see time hasn't eroded your tenacity.

20:29.238 --> 20:32.293
No, but it's given me
an appreciation for discretion.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.408
Austin, make sure the revisions

20:35.410 --> 20:37.677
get to the teleprompter this time.

20:37.679 --> 20:39.713
- Thank you, and thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:39.715 --> 20:41.000
Walk with me.

20:41.450 --> 20:43.250
Looking into one of your major donors.

20:43.252 --> 20:46.453
Terry Nabb. Owns Sharky's
Billiards on Bushwick.

20:46.455 --> 20:48.889
- You know him?
- I have a lot of donors.

20:48.891 --> 20:51.391
This one's been getting
a lot of attention lately.

20:51.393 --> 20:53.727
Then I hope he has my poster
in his window.

20:53.729 --> 20:55.729
Espada and I had a run in
with him today.

20:55.731 --> 20:59.453
We confiscated large amounts
of illicit cash on site.

21:00.469 --> 21:03.770
You know I've always attracted
guys with rough edges.

21:03.772 --> 21:06.231
I think we have that in common.

21:07.743 --> 21:09.676
Thing change.

21:09.678 --> 21:11.278
Yeah, on the outside.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.520
Enough to convince most people.

21:16.618 --> 21:20.420
All right, I will refund
Mr. Nabb's generous donation,

21:20.422 --> 21:21.702
okay?

21:22.424 --> 21:25.792
If I enter this into evidence,
someone less friendly

21:25.794 --> 21:30.379
might offer Mr. Nabb a deal
to develop a bigger conspiracy.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.748
Mafia investing in local politics.

21:34.670 --> 21:38.064
I wanted to make sure
that didn't smear an old friend.

21:39.775 --> 21:42.442
You know, maybe we should
catch up over a drink

21:42.444 --> 21:45.565
before you get too busy
down in that evidence room.

21:46.715 --> 21:48.415
8:00, our place?

21:48.417 --> 21:49.848
That works.

21:50.586 --> 21:51.863
And, Harlee?

21:52.487 --> 21:55.589
We really have to stop meeting
like this.

21:58.860 --> 22:01.795
And now, please give a warm welcome

22:01.797 --> 22:05.832
to your next mayor, Julia Ayres.

22:17.594 --> 22:20.029
So what, yo, bitch picked up
a burger bag

22:20.031 --> 22:20.896
with some dope in it.

22:20.898 --> 22:22.331
Any junkie could have put it there.

22:22.333 --> 22:24.433
Yeah, tell that to the crime lab techs.

22:24.435 --> 22:26.535
Nobody read me my Miranda's, so...

22:26.537 --> 22:28.337
Whoops, watch your step.

22:28.339 --> 22:30.239
Loman, warm him up in the box.

22:30.241 --> 22:31.407
The Lieutenant will be right there.

22:31.409 --> 22:33.108
No, I'm right here now.

22:33.110 --> 22:34.543
We have a serious problem.

22:34.545 --> 22:36.078
We got three serious problems.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.380
I got a dead girl, I got one
who's barely breathing,

22:38.382 --> 22:40.115
and you're standing between me

22:40.117 --> 22:41.550
and the guy who sold them the drugs.

22:41.552 --> 22:43.063
Sharky's Billiards.

22:43.399 --> 22:45.149
I did a little recon on our friend.

22:45.987 --> 22:47.953
Loman, put him
in the interrogation room.

22:47.955 --> 22:50.589
I see how it is.

22:50.591 --> 22:54.326
So bitches be calling
all the shots around here?

22:54.328 --> 22:56.195
You want to redeem yourself with me,

22:56.197 --> 22:58.097
start by following orders.

22:58.099 --> 22:59.331
Orders like, "Hey, Harlee",

22:59.333 --> 23:02.034
"pool hall down on Bushwick
is running small book and dice.

23:02.036 --> 23:03.702
Go down there and sign them up
for protection."

23:03.704 --> 23:06.505
- What's your point?
- It's not small book.

23:06.507 --> 23:09.041
It's a money laundering drop.

23:09.043 --> 23:11.911
50,000 that Espada and I just
confiscated from Terry's bar.

23:11.913 --> 23:14.713
Fine. Now you know
who to bring it back to.

23:14.715 --> 23:16.474
It's mafia money.

23:16.476 --> 23:19.218
Flying under our protection
straight into Julia's pocket.

23:19.220 --> 23:22.788
You really need her
to be worse than you, don't you?

23:22.790 --> 23:24.990
It's public record.

23:24.992 --> 23:28.627
Terry's broke, but he's donating
the maximum to her campaign.

23:28.629 --> 23:30.062
What the hell are you running with her?

23:30.064 --> 23:32.064
I'm not running anything.

23:32.066 --> 23:34.834
Well, somebody is.
And you cannot tell me

23:34.836 --> 23:37.536
that it's a coincidence that
a mafia drop ties back to Julia.

23:37.538 --> 23:39.238
Julia is one of our own.

23:39.240 --> 23:42.541
Is she? Because this is not
the Julia that I know.

23:42.543 --> 23:45.105
You don't know her like I know her.

23:50.885 --> 23:53.018
Parents make it to the hospital?

23:53.020 --> 23:54.991
Well, she'll never know.

23:56.991 --> 23:58.958
Woz, listen, um,

23:58.960 --> 24:02.561
the paramedics resuscitated her on site,

24:02.563 --> 24:05.761
but she had been deprived
of oxygen for too long.

24:06.607 --> 24:09.201
CT scan confirms the girl is brain dead.

24:09.610 --> 24:11.504
The doctors knew it all along, but...

24:11.506 --> 24:14.273
Parents have to be
the first ones notified

24:14.275 --> 24:16.259
of a child's death.

24:26.921 --> 24:30.122
You just graduated to double homicide.

24:30.124 --> 24:32.642
You better get me that lawyer then.

24:34.131 --> 24:37.830
I know somebody
smarter than you packaged this,

24:37.832 --> 24:39.732
so I want to know their names

24:39.734 --> 24:41.734
and the location of the rest of it.

24:41.736 --> 24:45.804
And I want a chick
with big hands and no teeth.

24:45.806 --> 24:48.908
Loman, leave the room
and close the door.

25:01.889 --> 25:04.757
They say one of these pills

25:04.759 --> 25:06.959
takes away all the pain.

25:09.230 --> 25:12.031
Now if that were true,

25:12.033 --> 25:14.700
you wouldn't need two.

25:14.702 --> 25:17.803
You have God himself
cradling you to sleep.

25:21.509 --> 25:25.811
And then you reach for another one.

25:25.813 --> 25:27.913
Now that's not numbness.

25:27.915 --> 25:30.015
It's violence.

25:32.753 --> 25:33.919
What's the saying?

25:33.921 --> 25:37.122
"Never get high from your own supply."

25:37.124 --> 25:38.691
- Isn't that what it is?
- Yo!

25:38.693 --> 25:40.522
Get this psycho away from me!

25:40.547 --> 25:42.647
I knew a girl.

25:45.533 --> 25:48.634
She took nine of these.

25:51.138 --> 25:54.131
How do you think that feels?

25:55.576 --> 25:57.109
I don't know.

25:57.111 --> 25:59.511
I don't mess
with the synthetic stuff, so...

25:59.513 --> 26:01.981
I need to know...

26:02.572 --> 26:04.083
for sure.

26:06.020 --> 26:08.231
And I need you...

26:08.990 --> 26:10.723
to show me.

26:14.795 --> 26:16.228
Better hope the dude isn't a bleeder.

26:16.230 --> 26:19.832
Rookies always get clean up.

26:19.834 --> 26:21.900
Seriously? Look, I get it's personal,

26:21.902 --> 26:23.235
but when does one of us go in there?

26:23.237 --> 26:25.537
Let Woz exorcise his demons,

26:25.539 --> 26:27.206
quickest way to the drugs.

26:27.208 --> 26:30.422
Anybody, get me out of here!

26:30.424 --> 26:32.845
Remodeling or is someone
starting a drum circle?

26:32.847 --> 26:35.281
No, it's a mouthy dealer,
our LT's just playing bad cop.

26:35.283 --> 26:36.815
Anything that will make my job harder?

26:38.819 --> 26:41.754
Last thing I want is you
doing any more overtime.

26:43.891 --> 26:45.791
Bad luck. The show's sold out.

26:45.793 --> 26:48.093
Yeah? What's playing?
I think I heard a femur crack.

26:48.095 --> 26:51.697
Well, some prefer a casual,
seemingly innocuous approach

26:51.699 --> 26:54.166
to interrogation,
others prefer to sell danger.

26:54.168 --> 26:55.680
I'm familiar with the concept.

26:55.682 --> 26:57.836
That's what keeps
Internal Affairs in business.

26:57.838 --> 26:59.171
This isn't some
off-site freezer, all right?

26:59.173 --> 27:00.572
There's cop etiquette.

27:00.574 --> 27:02.675
You don't jump another
detective's investigation.

27:02.677 --> 27:04.610
Your crew is my investigation.

27:04.612 --> 27:06.111
All right, if you're gonna go in there,

27:06.113 --> 27:07.646
you gotta know what you're walking into.

27:07.648 --> 27:10.384
Loman, you got the file on this guy?

27:11.519 --> 27:14.453
- Hey, hey!
- Woz, what are you doing?

27:14.455 --> 27:16.522
Testing his product,
that's what I'm doing.

27:16.524 --> 27:18.157
- How many?
- Well, I don't know,

27:18.159 --> 27:19.892
to tell you the truth.
Maybe we should start again.

27:19.894 --> 27:21.393
- Open that door.
- Call the paramedics.

27:21.395 --> 27:23.395
- Open...
- Occupied.

27:23.397 --> 27:25.931
- I need my stomach pumped.
- She's not gonna bail you out.

27:25.933 --> 27:28.367
She took your paperwork.
Ask her if she processed it.

27:28.369 --> 27:29.635
- Open the door!
- Still on my desk.

27:29.637 --> 27:31.470
No record that you're
even in this place.

27:31.472 --> 27:33.205
And I'm sure no one's
gonna be missing you.

27:33.207 --> 27:35.140
My chest, man! Uncuff me!
I need to throw up!

27:35.142 --> 27:36.308
Where'd you get these beauties?

27:36.310 --> 27:37.609
Tell me where you get these beauties.

27:37.611 --> 27:38.811
Your blood pressure is dropping.

27:38.813 --> 27:41.113
Without medical treatment,
you're looking at organ failure.

27:41.115 --> 27:41.914
I didn't get a name, okay?

27:41.916 --> 27:43.615
I got a supply of sample product.

27:43.617 --> 27:45.884
That's gonna be your last words?

27:45.886 --> 27:47.152
That's your last words?

27:47.154 --> 27:49.054
A mystery man gave you a free supply?

27:49.056 --> 27:50.289
Where is it? I don't feel so good.

27:50.291 --> 27:52.124
Where is it? Where's the stash?

27:52.126 --> 27:53.992
- I don't feel so good.
- Where's the stash?

27:53.994 --> 27:55.461
- Felix, tell him!
- Where's the stash?

27:55.463 --> 27:56.962
- This isn't worth dying over!
- Where's the stash?

27:56.964 --> 28:02.167
873 Hegeman Ave. 873 Hegeman Ave.

28:06.340 --> 28:09.208
Wake up. I need an EMT in here!

28:09.210 --> 28:12.077
Suspect tried to commit suicide!

28:16.317 --> 28:21.587
873 Hegeman. Bring me back every pill.

28:21.589 --> 28:22.919
Come on.

28:23.557 --> 28:25.524
Come on, stay awake.

28:51.083 --> 28:52.817
- Hey. Have you seen my mom?
- Hey.

28:52.819 --> 28:55.220
No, we had a medical emergency
with one of the suspects.

28:55.222 --> 28:57.689
She's with the EMTs.
You want me to radio her?

28:57.691 --> 28:59.191
No. No, it's okay.

28:59.193 --> 29:00.225
Just thought she might want a ride home.

29:00.227 --> 29:01.560
I heard it's been a long day.

29:01.562 --> 29:03.094
Will you hang out at my house some more

29:03.096 --> 29:05.063
so my kids can grow up
to be as sweet as you?

29:07.100 --> 29:09.334
Why are you still here?
Draw the short straw?

29:09.336 --> 29:11.636
Logging overtime.

29:11.638 --> 29:14.639
Trying to make sure
there's a comma in my paycheck.

29:14.641 --> 29:17.007
You didn't get any of that money?

29:17.886 --> 29:20.212
- What money?
- It's okay. My mom told me.

29:20.627 --> 29:21.792
Told you what?

29:21.794 --> 29:23.227
About what you guys did for us.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.310
I know you were trying to help.

29:25.312 --> 29:28.446
I get it. I'm not sure I do.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.168
What are you asking me, honey?

29:36.676 --> 29:38.066
Hey.

29:42.749 --> 29:44.682
Loman, find the stash?

29:45.618 --> 29:47.952
Yeah, over 500 counterfeit pills.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.687
Testing them for Fentanyl.

29:49.689 --> 29:53.991
Good. That dealer got amnesia
once I promised him

29:53.993 --> 29:56.649
that Wozniak wouldn't pay him
another visit.

29:58.391 --> 30:01.099
How'd you come up
with enough cash to pay Miguel?

30:02.935 --> 30:04.620
Where'd you hear that?

30:05.138 --> 30:07.323
You just missed Cristina.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.241
She stopped by hoping to say hi to you,

30:10.243 --> 30:12.515
but she had to split to do her homework.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.251
Cleaned out my emergency fund.

30:18.718 --> 30:20.818
Really? Because she seemed concerned

30:20.820 --> 30:22.659
that we were all going to get arrested.

30:23.756 --> 30:26.624
I think she's just confused
and hurt right now.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.629
So before the heist,
how come no one thought

30:31.631 --> 30:34.365
to give me a head's up that I
might never see my kids again?

30:36.669 --> 30:37.668
We all knew the risks.

30:37.670 --> 30:39.203
You sent Cristina

30:39.205 --> 30:40.871
to your sister's, Harlee.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.007
You knew something that we didn't.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.709
That seems to be going around lately.

30:44.711 --> 30:45.843
Yeah? How do you figure?

30:45.845 --> 30:47.278
You couldn't shoot a parked truck

30:47.280 --> 30:48.746
three feet away
without those painkillers.

30:48.748 --> 30:50.114
And it's becoming clear
you're the reason

30:50.116 --> 30:51.248
I need them in the first place.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.017
But somehow you pass a weapons requal

30:53.019 --> 30:55.086
and a drug test shortly after?

30:55.088 --> 30:57.722
What, you think I'm talking
to Internal Affairs?

30:57.724 --> 30:59.223
That I would rat out my crew?

30:59.225 --> 31:01.074
Everybody has their limit.

31:02.261 --> 31:03.427
We're under a lot of pressure right now,

31:03.429 --> 31:05.596
and I just want to make sure
we don't have any cracks.

31:05.598 --> 31:09.058
I'm solid. Like I've always been.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.889
Can the same be said about you?

31:13.106 --> 31:14.638
Like I've always been.

31:26.886 --> 31:29.887
Hey. Is Nate here?

31:29.889 --> 31:32.022
Yeah.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.891
Hold on.

31:33.893 --> 31:35.993
- Who is it?
- It's your dad, I think.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.898
Mom's not here.
She went upstate for a few days.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.032
It wasn't your fault.

31:42.034 --> 31:43.868
No, this is squarely on you, Dad.

31:43.870 --> 31:45.970
I'm not talking about your mom.

31:49.675 --> 31:50.908
I'm a good cop.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.243
Yeah, I know.

31:52.245 --> 31:54.245
Made your grandpa proud.

31:54.247 --> 31:56.347
He told me that himself.

31:59.652 --> 32:01.589
But I haven't...

32:02.588 --> 32:05.122
always been the perfect husband.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.158
Look, Dad, I got risotto
on the stove, okay?

32:07.160 --> 32:10.954
I'm a good friend.
I've been a good boss.

32:12.165 --> 32:14.377
I've been a good soldier.

32:15.034 --> 32:19.457
But I haven't been a good father.

32:22.308 --> 32:25.096
Annie was crying for help...

32:25.611 --> 32:27.711
and I missed it.

32:30.283 --> 32:32.960
And then after she took the pills,

32:33.820 --> 32:38.556
the silence, it w... it was deafening...

32:38.558 --> 32:40.512
that I-I didn't...

32:42.728 --> 32:45.249
I didn't hear you.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.763
I'm so sorry..

32:50.937 --> 32:53.337
I'm sorry, son.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.346
I'm really sorry.

33:00.580 --> 33:02.231
You'll...

33:03.716 --> 33:06.083
you'll never forgive me

33:06.085 --> 33:09.488
for what I did to your sister, will you?

33:11.557 --> 33:14.159
I don't think you want to be forgiven.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.357
Hey, Dad.

33:28.007 --> 33:30.107
Home safe.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.314
Safe tomorrow.

33:41.236 --> 33:43.070
Sure I can't offer something stronger?

33:43.072 --> 33:45.849
Something that may keep you
from being able to drive home?

33:45.851 --> 33:48.242
I'm still on the clock.

33:48.878 --> 33:51.111
About what you saw earlier today, um,

33:51.113 --> 33:55.289
I know it wasn't pretty,
but it was time sensitive.

33:55.314 --> 33:59.182
Your boss interrogating
a suspect into cardiac arrest?

33:59.184 --> 34:01.952
By-the-book doesn't always
assure the best outcome.

34:01.954 --> 34:04.521
Yeah. Throwing it out would
make all our jobs easier,

34:04.523 --> 34:05.854
wouldn't it?

34:06.492 --> 34:08.991
Look, I didn't come here...

34:10.295 --> 34:12.429
I just... I just didn't want you
you think...

34:12.431 --> 34:14.293
That you paint outside the lines?

34:15.567 --> 34:17.303
Shocking.

34:22.279 --> 34:24.550
I just can't catch a break.

34:27.505 --> 34:29.246
I can't do it.

34:29.583 --> 34:31.911
No matter how hard I try, I just...

34:33.942 --> 34:37.817
I can't protect the people that I love

34:37.819 --> 34:39.222
without...

34:39.793 --> 34:41.553
hurting other people.

34:43.329 --> 34:45.594
Maybe...

34:48.233 --> 34:51.001
maybe you don't need to work so hard

34:51.003 --> 34:53.804
to save them from themselves.

34:54.283 --> 34:56.719
You're a bit of a hypocrite
in that sense?

34:58.210 --> 35:00.644
Yeah, in one particular case,

35:00.646 --> 35:04.889
but, wow, is she worth the exception.

35:12.184 --> 35:13.584
Buzzer interrupts.

35:13.609 --> 35:15.142
I'll rip that thing off the wall.

35:21.917 --> 35:23.083
Hello?

35:23.085 --> 35:26.053
Hi, it's me. Can I come up?

35:26.416 --> 35:27.782
You have a "hi, it's me"?

35:27.784 --> 35:30.718
- Caroline.
- Ex-fiance?

35:30.720 --> 35:32.887
Actually, now is not a good time.

35:32.889 --> 35:34.488
You didn't pick up your phone.

35:34.490 --> 35:35.689
I just want to talk.

35:35.691 --> 35:36.724
Caroline, I don't think there's anything

35:36.726 --> 35:38.273
left to be said.

35:38.628 --> 35:40.394
Don't... don't leave.

35:40.396 --> 35:41.729
Would you rather I come by the office?

35:41.731 --> 35:44.698
It looks like
you got your hands full.

35:44.700 --> 35:46.634
And I gotta go meet up with a friend.

35:46.636 --> 35:49.105
- Thought you were on the clock.
- I am.

36:14.297 --> 36:17.431
- Lost my key.
- Maybe for the best.

36:17.433 --> 36:19.800
I don't think I've seen you before.

36:20.216 --> 36:23.070
- Are you new?
- Not that new.

36:23.492 --> 36:25.039
Hope your night gets better.

36:37.119 --> 36:39.053
Chilly night.

36:39.055 --> 36:41.121
Season's changing.

36:55.018 --> 36:57.018
Testing, one, two, three.

36:57.020 --> 36:58.635
Testing.

36:58.889 --> 37:00.922
Testing, one, two, three.

37:00.924 --> 37:02.991
Testing.

37:16.406 --> 37:17.639
Now that's the Julia I know.

37:17.641 --> 37:21.343
Yeah. Vintage me seemed
more appropriate for the venue.

37:21.345 --> 37:22.510
Not the fanciest joint,

37:22.512 --> 37:24.245
but at least you can
let your guard down.

37:24.247 --> 37:25.654
Yeah.

37:26.049 --> 37:28.483
'Cause I'm not sure I've ever
seen you let yours down.

37:28.485 --> 37:32.554
Scotch rocks and rye neat for Her Honor.

37:32.556 --> 37:35.490
Hey, don't jinx me, Tommy.

37:35.492 --> 37:37.325
So drinks are on you, right?

37:37.327 --> 37:40.562
That's the rule when you stumble
into a bucket of money.

37:40.564 --> 37:43.064
It was a bucket of something, all right.

37:43.066 --> 37:45.233
You know, you were lucky
it was me that found it.

37:45.235 --> 37:47.102
Harlee, you don't need me
to explain to you

37:47.104 --> 37:48.870
how my world works. You're smart.

37:48.872 --> 37:50.472
It's not so different from yours.

37:50.474 --> 37:51.740
But we're a little bit more selective

37:51.742 --> 37:53.341
who we let in the tent.

37:53.343 --> 37:55.410
You mean like dealers,
pimps, and bookies?

37:55.412 --> 37:57.345
Remember, I used to run the door
of that tent.

37:57.347 --> 37:58.947
Then you remember that
the only reason we do it

37:58.949 --> 38:00.918
is to keep our backyard safe.

38:01.618 --> 38:03.856
So here's to the greater good.

38:04.254 --> 38:05.654
To the greater good.

38:06.623 --> 38:08.223
Who are we toasting to?

38:08.225 --> 38:10.692
- Good, you made it.
- Hey, where's my drink?

38:10.694 --> 38:13.461
We didn't want your
Shirley Temple to get all warm.

38:13.463 --> 38:15.530
Didn't think you'd be
in a social mood tonight.

38:15.532 --> 38:17.913
And miss chatting with my favorites?

38:18.435 --> 38:21.469
So, what are we chatting about?

38:21.471 --> 38:24.372
Harlee's showing some
real interest in politics.

38:24.374 --> 38:25.730
Really?

38:25.732 --> 38:27.995
You thinking of leaving the squad too?

38:28.082 --> 38:29.693
Smart, tough, and camera ready.

38:29.695 --> 38:31.377
You ought to keep your eye
on this one, Woz.

38:31.401 --> 38:33.334
I roll better with a crew.

38:33.336 --> 38:36.671
Not as glamorous,
but we watch each other's backs.

38:36.673 --> 38:39.005
And forgive our faults.

38:39.834 --> 38:42.950
Tommy! How about a whiskey?

38:44.247 --> 38:46.514
I was just offering Julia
some scandal insurance

38:46.516 --> 38:47.649
for her campaign.

38:47.651 --> 38:49.484
And I was about to explain

38:49.486 --> 38:51.419
that I don't have the luxury
of being picky

38:51.421 --> 38:53.898
about who joins my fan club.

38:58.071 --> 38:59.527
Look, the wrong cop gets wind of this,

38:59.529 --> 39:02.196
and you're on the front page of
"The Times" doing a perp walk.

39:02.198 --> 39:03.998
Harlee, I keep my house in order.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.446
Doesn't seem that way.

39:06.406 --> 39:08.069
Took me less than 48 hours

39:08.071 --> 39:10.638
to stumble across two loads
of dirty laundry.

39:11.056 --> 39:12.674
And not the kind that leads to scandal,

39:12.676 --> 39:15.086
but to some serious charges.

39:16.251 --> 39:19.247
Politics at this level,
there's always a price.

39:19.249 --> 39:22.283
I mean, take Bianchi.
It's quid pro quo...

39:22.285 --> 39:24.316
Tommy! What the hell's
the matter with you?

39:24.318 --> 39:25.687
Sorry, I didn't know
you were gonna reach...

39:25.689 --> 39:27.288
It's my fault. It's my fault.

39:27.290 --> 39:28.423
She's gonna be the next mayor!
What's the matter...

39:28.425 --> 39:29.457
Hey, it's okay.

39:29.459 --> 39:31.196
Get your hands off of me!

39:31.198 --> 39:33.027
All right. Tommy, he's had a rough day.

39:33.029 --> 39:34.925
Get out.

39:36.898 --> 39:38.143
Hey. Yeah?

39:38.145 --> 39:39.534
You should go home.

39:40.168 --> 39:42.070
Yeah, okay. All right.

39:42.072 --> 39:44.716
Hey, Harlee, it was nice
catching up with you.

39:44.718 --> 39:46.107
Yeah.

39:46.451 --> 39:47.850
You're making progress.

39:47.852 --> 39:49.652
I know you can't see it, Woz.

39:49.654 --> 39:52.455
No. You can't see it.

39:52.457 --> 39:56.459
When my daughter died, I spun out,

39:56.461 --> 39:58.494
and I tore the city apart

39:58.496 --> 40:01.130
looking for the dealer
who sold her the drugs.

40:01.938 --> 40:05.435
Nate found him, took a bat to his head,

40:05.437 --> 40:08.382
and left him lying in the street.

40:09.642 --> 40:11.341
Julia covered it up.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.412
Don't make me choose.

40:40.951 --> 40:42.295
Busted.

40:42.297 --> 40:44.528
You're the one that's busted.
Found my brown boots

40:44.530 --> 40:46.465
and blue sweater
that Tess got me for Christmas.

40:46.490 --> 40:47.856
Well, sharing is caring.

40:47.858 --> 40:49.758
Yeah. Not when it's one-sided.

40:49.760 --> 40:52.761
It doesn't count
if you didn't know about it.

41:16.295 --> 41:18.320
I know you can't see it, Woz.

41:18.322 --> 41:20.255
No, you can't see it.

41:20.257 --> 41:23.592
When my daughter died, I spun out,

41:23.594 --> 41:26.201
and I tore the city apart

41:26.203 --> 41:28.964
looking for the dealer
who sold her the drugs.

41:28.966 --> 41:32.968
Nate found him, took a bat to his head,

41:32.970 --> 41:35.037
and left him lying...

41:54.225 --> 41:56.025
Who's texting you so late?

41:56.027 --> 41:58.161
It's no one you know.
