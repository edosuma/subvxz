WEBVTT

00:09.309 --> 00:10.310
Does he wear jewelry?

00:10.310 --> 00:12.312
'cause I don't do "man jewelry. "

00:12.312 --> 00:14.014
He doesn't wear jewelry.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.015
What about skin issues?

00:16.015 --> 00:19.319
Because I have a thing
against tags, growths,

00:19.319 --> 00:21.321
any kind of fleshy masses.

00:21.321 --> 00:23.323
Ann, he's male and his heart is beating.

00:23.323 --> 00:25.025
What else do you need to know?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.693
Okay.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.128
Frasier.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.429
Roz, I came as quickly as I could.

00:29.429 --> 00:30.430
What's the emergency?

00:30.430 --> 00:32.125
Oh, no, it's not an
emergency. It's just...

00:32.432 --> 00:33.126
Hi. I'm Ann Hodges .

00:33.433 --> 00:35.424
I'm divorced.

00:36.136 --> 00:38.438
I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Frasier crane.

00:38.438 --> 00:40.440
I thought you two would like to meet.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.441
Ann is in insurance.

00:41.441 --> 00:43.143
Oh, well, I'm sorry she dragged you

00:43.143 --> 00:44.144
all the way down here.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.445
I've just renewed my policy.

00:45.445 --> 00:47.447
Perhaps Roz could introduce
you to my brother Niles.

00:47.447 --> 00:48.448
Is he single?

00:48.448 --> 00:49.449
No, but with a baby on the way,

00:49.449 --> 00:51.151
he might need some additional coverage.

00:51.151 --> 00:52.152
Super.

00:52.152 --> 00:53.449
Well, thanks a lot, Roz.

00:54.154 --> 00:56.145
This was totally worth
a drive across town.

00:59.125 --> 01:02.128
Are you dense? I was
trying to set you guys up.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.117
Why would you do that?

01:03.630 --> 01:04.631
I don't know.

01:04.631 --> 01:06.633
Maybe because you
haven't had a date in ages

01:06.633 --> 01:08.134
and it's starting to show.

01:08.134 --> 01:09.636
What is that, your purse?

01:09.636 --> 01:12.127
This is a grocery tote.

01:12.639 --> 01:13.640
I wanted to pick up some vegetables

01:13.640 --> 01:14.629
and some cat food at the market.

01:15.141 --> 01:16.540
You did not get a cat.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.540
No, no, I am cat-sitting
for a neighbor.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.246
And I go out. I'm
going out this evening .

01:20.246 --> 01:21.247
With whom?

01:21.247 --> 01:22.248
People.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.239
People you're related to?

01:24.551 --> 01:26.252
They're still people.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.254
Listen, Roz, I may not
go out as often as you do,

01:28.254 --> 01:29.243
but that's because I have standards.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.558
Haven't you ever heard
of waiting for Miss Right?

01:31.558 --> 01:33.593
Yeah, well, Miss Right
has standards, too,

01:33.593 --> 01:35.562
and she's not looking
to meet Mr. Mothballs.

01:35.562 --> 01:38.565
You can smell that ? Oh, dear.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.266
You need a place holder.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.268
You know, someone you can go out with

01:42.268 --> 01:44.270
and just keep your dating muscles toned.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.273
That way you'll be ready
when Miss Right comes along.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.275
And Ann Hodges is a born place holder.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.578
I don't want to go out with
somebody I'm not interested in .

01:51.578 --> 01:53.279
I would rather wait for Miss Right.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.581
And while I'm waiting,

01:54.581 --> 01:56.749
there's no reason I can't
li a rich and rewarding life.

01:56.749 --> 01:58.318
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:58.318 --> 02:00.820
I need to get these vegetables home

02:00.820 --> 02:02.310
and into a hearty winter soup.

02:02.822 --> 02:03.323
Oh, hi, guys.

02:03.323 --> 02:05.325
Hey, Doc, you're always free.

02:05.325 --> 02:06.826
My cousin's in town.

02:06.826 --> 02:07.815
Why don't you help me show her the city?

02:08.294 --> 02:09.262
Did Roz put you up to this?

02:09.262 --> 02:11.297
I had nothing to do
with it. I swear to God.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.799
Well, I'm sorry, Kenny,

02:12.799 --> 02:14.801
but I am booked all this weekend.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.302
Oh, here's luck.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.304
I found a perfectly good
thimble in this pocket.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.305
See you later.

02:19.305 --> 02:21.307
Thanks anyway.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.296
Hey, I tried.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.683
NILES; Reservation for crane.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.352
For four, sir?

02:32.352 --> 02:34.654
No, sorry, for five. We added one.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.645
All we have is a table for four.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.358
We can all squeeze.

02:38.358 --> 02:39.659
This one's always on my lap

02:39.659 --> 02:41.661
after the second drink anyway.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.652
very well, madam.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.355
get the chair.

02:47.667 --> 02:51.371
You know, there's really no
need to go to all this trouble.

02:51.371 --> 02:54.374
I have a perfectly good
winter soup back home.

02:54.374 --> 02:55.375
Don't be silly. Oh, no.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.377
All right, um...

02:57.377 --> 02:58.678
Well, um...

02:58.678 --> 03:00.373
Oh!

03:00.680 --> 03:04.384
I'm sorry. Do you have anything higher?

03:04.384 --> 03:08.377
Sorry, sir. I will look for a cushion.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.391
So, Fras,

03:11.391 --> 03:14.394
tell everybody about that new
antique you picked up today.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.696
Well, it's a late Regency
fruitwood mirror.

03:16.696 --> 03:20.393
very valuable if it has the
original glass, which mine does.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.394
No. What are the odds?

03:21.701 --> 03:22.702
Boy, if you like mirrors

03:22.702 --> 03:24.693
you should see the one Ronee's
got in her dressing room.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.407
It's got lights all around the edges,

03:27.407 --> 03:29.671
and it has three settings.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.378
Yeah. Daytime, nighttime, and yikes.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.379
(laughing)

03:33.379 --> 03:34.681
Oh, yes, excuse me.

03:34.681 --> 03:38.384
If I could get a place
setting, that would be lovely.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.386
What's Inizio Due cuore?

03:40.386 --> 03:42.388
That's our appetizer sampler for two.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.389
A bruschetta for you,

03:43.389 --> 03:45.391
a bruschetta for your love and so on.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.688
Is it possible to make that for one?

03:50.396 --> 03:50.964
One?

03:50.964 --> 03:53.399
Yes, a bruschetta for me,

03:53.399 --> 03:56.459
no bruschetta for my love and so on.

03:56.703 --> 03:57.770
I'm sorry. It's dueor no.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.772
 NILES; That's fine.

03:59.772 --> 04:01.274
We'll get two orders
and we'll just all share.

04:01.274 --> 04:02.764
very good.

04:04.277 --> 04:07.280
Mm, looks delicious.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.281
This is fun, you know.

04:08.281 --> 04:09.782
This is the first time

04:09.782 --> 04:11.272
Marty and I have been
out with another couple.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.621
And... Frasier.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.322
It's fun being out with Frasier, too.

04:16.322 --> 04:17.624
(all agreeing)

04:17.624 --> 04:19.325
We love being out with
Frasier, don't we, Niles.

04:19.325 --> 04:21.361
All right, listen, all
of you, just knock it off.

04:21.361 --> 04:22.629
Welcome, everyone.

04:22.629 --> 04:25.331
42 years ago tonight,

04:25.331 --> 04:27.634
I married my beautiful Theresa.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.534
And now, we hope

04:29.902 --> 04:32.505
that all you loving couples out there

04:32.505 --> 04:35.508
will help us celebrate our happiness

04:35.508 --> 04:37.999
by joining us in a dance.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:49.889 --> 04:51.447
 The fish..

04:51.624 --> 04:53.717
Oh, just go dance .

05:18.017 --> 05:19.018
Hello...

05:19.018 --> 05:21.020
Mr. Bottomsley.

05:21.020 --> 05:25.525
Dinner was an absolute nightmare.

05:25.525 --> 05:29.028
Fortunately, I was able
to slip out of there early

05:29.028 --> 05:31.531
and pick you up a little treat.

05:31.531 --> 05:32.532
(chuckles)

05:32.532 --> 05:33.533
Fresh tuna.

05:33.533 --> 05:36.434
. You're welcome

05:36.469 --> 05:38.071
(over answering machine)
; Frasier, this is Roz.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.972
Write down this number.

05:39.972 --> 05:40.973
555-01 79.

05:40.973 --> 05:44.477
Don't get mad, but that's Ann's number.

05:44.477 --> 05:45.978
I talked to her and she really thought

05:45.978 --> 05:47.947
you were cute and sweet and...

05:47.947 --> 05:49.949
Honestly, why does everyone assume

05:49.949 --> 05:52.385
that I need some
companionship in my life?

05:52.385 --> 05:55.877
Has the world gone mad, Mr. Bottomsley?

05:59.692 --> 06:04.130
What shall we two bachelor
s do this evening, Mr. B?

06:04.130 --> 06:06.599
 Perhaps a crossword puzzle?

06:06.599 --> 06:08.089
Maybe watch a little telly?

06:08.601 --> 06:09.602
Oh, I
know--

06:09.602 --> 06:11.437
how about a nice hot bath?

06:11.437 --> 06:12.939
(chuckles)

06:12.939 --> 06:15.430
I'm just teasing.

06:15.942 --> 06:19.645
, Now, I know that you're
used to eating canned tuna

06:19.645 --> 06:21.147
so this will taste different,

06:21.147 --> 06:23.983
but if you're like me,
I think you'll agree

06:23.983 --> 06:25.485
it's much better.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.488
If only there were a treat here for me.

06:28.488 --> 06:29.989
(gasps)

06:29.989 --> 06:32.492
What's this?

06:32.492 --> 06:35.495
A delicious nine-vegetable winter soup.

06:35.495 --> 06:36.996
Oh...

06:36.996 --> 06:38.498
(sniffs)

06:38.498 --> 06:40.566
Yes, Mr. B, I think you were right

06:40.566 --> 06:41.555
about the bay leaves.

06:44.971 --> 06:49.475
(with British accent); Oh, Mr.
Bottomsley, lovely to see you again, sir.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.978
Your customary table, I presume, hmm?

06:51.978 --> 06:54.480
Splendid.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.482
Here you go.

06:56.482 --> 06:57.550
(sighs)

06:57.550 --> 07:00.485
come on, buddy.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.188
Well, isn't this civilized?

07:02.188 --> 07:04.179
Beat it, Eddie. There's none for you.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.195
Do you feel a draft, Mr. B?

07:09.195 --> 07:11.186
I'm just a little bit cold.

07:11.697 --> 07:13.187
There we are.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.192
That's better.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.241
Ooh, that's still a little too hot.

07:22.241 --> 07:26.212
You know what? While
we're letting that cool,

07:26.212 --> 07:31.117
why don't we find a
home for our antique.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.119
There we are. Yes.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.622
You know, you don't find
one of these very easily.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.125
Especially in such good condition.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.128
Won't that covetous Niles
be m when he sees it, hmm?

07:42.128 --> 07:43.618
But he can't have it, can he?

07:44.130 --> 07:45.131
No.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.133
Yes, he can't have it,

07:47.133 --> 07:48.634
can he?

07:48.634 --> 07:50.124
No, no...

07:52.505 --> 07:53.995
Dear God, I'm Aunt Shirley .

07:56.509 --> 07:57.510
(cat shrieks)

07:57.510 --> 07:59.501
get that number.

08:07.587 --> 08:11.591
Mrs. gablyczyck... these new shirts,

08:11.591 --> 08:13.593
did Mrs. crane ask
you to buy them for me?

08:13.593 --> 08:15.595
Because I already have
shirts just like these.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.898
No, no, after I wash, I pin them

08:18.898 --> 08:20.889
and wrap in plastic.

08:23.603 --> 08:24.904
You not like?

08:24.904 --> 08:26.606
No, no...

08:26.606 --> 08:28.908
(voice breaking); I like very much.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.910
Thank you, mister.

08:30.910 --> 08:31.911
(doorbell ringing)

08:31.911 --> 08:32.912
Oh...

08:32.912 --> 08:34.607
No, I'll get it.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.620
Hey, Dad, come on in. Hi.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.611
Daphne will be right down and we can go.

08:42.922 --> 08:43.616
Where's Frasier?

08:43.923 --> 08:44.924
On a date.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.926
get out!

08:46.926 --> 08:48.928
About time, huh?

08:48.928 --> 08:51.631
You know, it's like I
was saying to Eddie--

08:51.631 --> 08:53.633
this guy's got to get a life.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.701
DAPHNE; Niles, I left $60

08:55.701 --> 08:57.203
on the desk yesterday

08:57.203 --> 08:58.704
and now it's gone.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.206
Is that proof enough for you?

09:00.206 --> 09:01.207
Are you sure you didn't misplace it?

09:01.207 --> 09:02.208
You know I didn't.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.676
What's going on?

09:03.676 --> 09:05.177
Ever since we hired Mrs. gablyczyck

09:05.177 --> 09:06.166
things have been
disappearing--

09:06.679 --> 09:08.169
liquor, money, linens.

09:08.681 --> 09:09.749
So she's stealing from you.

09:09.749 --> 09:11.284
Yes. We don't know that.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.273
And frankly, it's hard to believe

09:12.785 --> 09:13.774
that someone who'll
go out in a rainstorm

09:14.287 --> 09:15.288
to clean pigeon muck
from the solarium skylight

09:15.288 --> 09:17.790
is capable of theft.

09:17.790 --> 09:18.791
We can't put up with stealing

09:18.791 --> 09:20.793
just because she's
good at what she does.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.283
First of all, she's not
good at what she does.

09:22.795 --> 09:23.693
She's brilliant.

09:25.031 --> 09:29.101
She's an artist.

09:29.101 --> 09:31.137
Tell you what-- you give
me five minutes with her.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.639
If she's hiding anything,
I'll get it out of her.

09:33.639 --> 09:36.642
Dad, we are not going to coerce
a confession out of this woman

09:36.642 --> 09:38.144
based on circumstantial evidence.

09:38.144 --> 09:40.146
(bell dings)

09:40.146 --> 09:41.647
Oven is clean.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.650
Now I scrub down dishwasher.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.642
Oh, Mrs. gablyczyck, you
dropped some... money.

09:50.156 --> 09:52.147
Thank you, mister.

09:55.161 --> 09:56.651
All right, Dad, you've got five minutes.

09:59.832 --> 10:04.667
FRASIER; We'd like your famous
appetizer for two, please.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.606
I'll let your waiter know.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.907
Thank you very much.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.609
So, Ann...

10:09.609 --> 10:10.910
tell me everything.

10:10.910 --> 10:14.347
Who is Ann Hodges?

10:14.347 --> 10:19.352
Wow. Well, I'm an
insurance claims adjuster.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.853
That's what' s so funny.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.343
When we met, you thought I was in sales,

10:22.855 --> 10:23.856
 but I'm not.

10:23.856 --> 10:24.857
Oh.

10:24.857 --> 10:26.859
I'm in claims.

10:26.859 --> 10:31.364
Well, you know, we don't
have to have just shop talk.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.332
What are your dreams?

10:33.332 --> 10:35.368
Oh, my God.

10:35.368 --> 10:41.874
Well, my dream is to be
aseniorclaims adjuster.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.876
It's sort of the same,

10:43.876 --> 10:46.879
but you get a private cube
and your own extension.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.381
 I would've got it last year

10:48.381 --> 10:50.883
but I paid a big claim
the company didn't like.

10:50.883 --> 10:52.885
I knew I goofed the second I did it.

10:52.885 --> 10:55.888
It was just one of those
"Shoot!" moments, you know,

10:55.888 --> 10:57.390
when you just say "Shoot!"

10:57.390 --> 10:59.725
Do you ever do that,

10:59.725 --> 11:02.728
make a big mistake and
want to go back in time

11:02.728 --> 11:05.219
and just do something different?

11:07.233 --> 11:09.724
Oh, yes.

11:10.236 --> 11:11.737
Well, I'm going to run
to the ladies' room.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.239
I just had to have that Dr. Pepper

11:13.239 --> 11:16.231
while I was getting dressed.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.249
good evening, sir. Ah.

11:23.249 --> 11:25.351
Would you care for something to
drink? Yes, as a matter of fact,

11:25.351 --> 11:26.886
I would-- I'd like,
uh, your finest bottle

11:26.886 --> 11:28.387
of Barolo, please.

11:28.387 --> 11:29.889
Why don't you come back in a minute

11:29.889 --> 11:30.878
and see what the lady likes.

11:35.394 --> 11:36.395
Doc? Hm?

11:36.395 --> 11:37.897
Hey, small world! Oh, Kenny, hi.

11:37.897 --> 11:40.399
This is my cousin I
was telling you about.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.401
This is Dr. crane. Oh.

11:42.401 --> 11:44.130
e, Hello. Dr. c ran

11:44.403 --> 11:46.439
I heard your show
today-- it was great.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.940
(chuckles); Well...

11:47.940 --> 11:49.430
Is this your, uh, first time in Seattle?

11:49.909 --> 11:51.501
Yes, it is-- I'm
a fine arts dealer,

11:51.944 --> 11:55.147
but I'm considering a curator
position at the Seattle Art Museum.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.849
That's impressive.
KENNY:Oh, that's nothing.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.150
She teaches kids ballet,

11:58.150 --> 12:00.853
and she rock climbs, she plays the harp.

12:00.853 --> 12:02.755
Oh, what am I doing? I
haven't introduced you.

12:02.755 --> 12:03.823
Dr. Frasier crane,

12:03.823 --> 12:05.848
Liz Wright.

12:09.361 --> 12:12.364
It's lovely to meet you. .. Miss Wright.

12:12.364 --> 12:13.866
(chuckles)

12:13.866 --> 12:15.801
Well, it's too bad
you're not free tonight.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.303
 You could've joined us.

12:17.303 --> 12:18.793
Well, how about tomorrow night?

12:19.171 --> 12:21.230
Oh, I'd love to, but I'm on
a plane tonight to Amsterdam.

12:21.907 --> 12:22.908
I have a job offer there as well.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.211
I'm doing my best to
convince her to pick Seattle,

12:25.211 --> 12:27.913
but it's tough when you're
up against the Dutch.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.107
Ah.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.016
I could've really used
your help there, Doc.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.052
 Yes, well, you know, I'm
just about finished up here.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.754
You know, we wouldn't want
to interrupt your date.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.755
Oh, it's not a date. It's not a date.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.757
It's just a little business thing.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.059
 I'll tell you what,
I'll just wrap things up here

12:40.059 --> 12:43.051
and then I'll come and help
yo wage the battle for Seattle.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.764
(laughs) ; Okay.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.062
That's great. We'll see you soon.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.771
Man, oh, man, that place was a madhouse.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.763
I got so tired of waiting,
I just decided to hold it.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.075
I'm so glad yo u picked Italian.

13:00.846 --> 13:02.782
I love macaroni.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.083
Ah.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.786
That's another thing w e
have in common, I guess.

13:06.786 --> 13:07.787
(chuckles) ; Well...

13:07.787 --> 13:09.778
Uh, you know, Ann, uh,
first dates are funny.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.785
Uh, sometimes it takes a
while for two people to click.

13:13.092 --> 13:14.787
Sometimes you know right away, and, uh,

13:15.094 --> 13:17.085
I think when you do, you
should just feel free...

13:17.797 --> 13:19.799
You are so cute. c lick.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.100
(laughing)

13:21.100 --> 13:22.101
What?

13:22.101 --> 13:23.090
click,
click--

13:23.803 --> 13:25.805
the sound of us clicking.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.807
Ann, um...

13:27.807 --> 13:30.109
You don't know what a relief this is.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.111
I've only had one date since my divorce.

13:32.111 --> 13:34.814
Well, half a date.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.116
The jerk actually called
it off in the middle of dinner.

13:37.116 --> 13:38.818
I was a wreck.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.820
I didn't get out of bed for a week.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.811
Or shave my legs.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.125
Your appetizers. Oh.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.828
gosh, this is a feast.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.831
I'm not sure we'll need
to order a main course.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.833
Well, this ain't gonna do it forme.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.822
 I'm starvin' like Marvin.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.872
Mrs. gablyczyck, we're friends here.

14:02.308 --> 14:05.211
No one wants to send you to
jail or back to your country.

14:05.211 --> 14:08.848
We just need you to admit
that you took the money.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.149
I no take nothing.

14:10.149 --> 14:11.851
Do you want to go to jail?!

14:11.851 --> 14:13.148
Do you want to go back to your country?!

14:15.054 --> 14:17.056
Well, I was hoping it
wouldn't come to this,

14:17.056 --> 14:19.558
but I'm afraid we're going
to have to show her the tape.

14:19.558 --> 14:20.559
What tape?

14:20.559 --> 14:22.561
It's from the surveillance camera.

14:22.561 --> 14:24.563
It shows you stealing.

14:24.563 --> 14:26.030
(whispers) ; You have a camera?

14:26.532 --> 14:27.032
DAPHNE; You might as well confess.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.534
I've got the evidence.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.525
I want to see tape.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.528
All right.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.544
I'll give you one last chance

14:38.544 --> 14:40.535
to tell the truth, Mrs. gablyczyck,

14:41.046 --> 14:42.548
because if we watch this tape,

14:42.548 --> 14:45.551
we'll have no choice
but to call the police.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.052
I see tape.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.542
All right.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.556
I'm putting the tape in.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.548
Here I go.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.551
I'm pressing play.

14:59.064 --> 15:03.569
Now I'm switching the
input from cable to video.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.560
Niles, get ready to call the police.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.562
?? .. (people singing on tape)
; ??... birthday, dear Dad...

15:09.074 --> 15:10.075
 Hey, that's me!

15:10.075 --> 15:11.076
Yes,

15:11.076 --> 15:13.067
I used an old tape of
your birthday party,

15:13.579 --> 15:15.080
but the surveillance part's coming up.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.082
Last chance, Mrs. gablyczyck.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.417
It's coming up...

15:18.417 --> 15:19.518
Okay, I have to step in here...

15:19.518 --> 15:21.008
All right, all right!

15:21.520 --> 15:23.022
I stole.

15:23.022 --> 15:24.023
You did?

15:24.023 --> 15:25.513
I didn't think you know.

15:26.025 --> 15:27.515
I bring it back.

15:28.027 --> 15:29.426
(sighs)

15:29.929 --> 15:31.920
Well done, Daphne.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.934
Oh, but I'm so disappointed.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.437
I was really hoping you were wrong.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.939
Hey, hey, did you see that?

15:39.939 --> 15:40.940
Watch this again.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.442
What?

15:43.442 --> 15:44.944
You must have put the camera down

15:44.944 --> 15:47.313
when we went into the
kitchen for ice cream.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.281
Watch Daphne's mother.

15:49.281 --> 15:52.216
My mother? She stayed
behind to grab her sweater.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.087
And our candlesticks.

15:55.087 --> 15:57.578
And our
20-year-old scotch.

15:58.057 --> 16:01.126
This is plate I brought home.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.028
so I take Mrs. crane'

16:03.028 --> 16:05.030
leftover meat pie.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.333
But I brought plate back.

16:07.333 --> 16:10.035
Mrs. gablyczyck... we're so sorry.

16:10.035 --> 16:12.026
We've made a terrible mistake.

16:12.338 --> 16:15.341
We know now you didn't steal anything.

16:15.341 --> 16:17.343
can you ever forgive us?

16:17.343 --> 16:19.038
Of course, mister.

16:19.345 --> 16:22.047
You're nice man.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.038
And you're nice lady.

16:32.257 --> 16:34.326
Are you sure that' s all the
little bunny wants to eat,

16:34.326 --> 16:37.022
just a little green salad?

16:38.330 --> 16:41.322
The bunny had a big Mexican lunch.

16:44.036 --> 16:45.025
You know, if you're feeling full,

16:45.337 --> 16:47.339
then I'm sure they could wrap
up the rest of that for you.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.341
Oh, no, I'm just trying to pace myself

16:49.341 --> 16:51.043
so I'll have room for dessert.

16:51.043 --> 16:55.036
I hear the souffl here
is well worth the wait.

16:58.517 --> 17:01.520
Excuse me. I'd better get that.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.022
That didn't even ring.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.012
. Yes, it did. Hello? Oh

17:06.025 --> 17:07.515
Niles?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.528
Is there something wrong?

17:09.528 --> 17:11.030
Oh, dear God, well,

17:11.030 --> 17:13.031
you-you just stay there on the floor.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.032
I'll be right there.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.035
I'm so sorry. Uh...

17:16.035 --> 17:17.023
Is everything all right?

17:17.536 --> 17:18.525
Well, uh, actually, it's my brother.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.039
He's thrown out his back again.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.541
Oh, God, right in the middle
of our magical evening, too.

17:23.541 --> 17:24.542
check, please. Thank you.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.545
Uh, you know...

17:26.545 --> 17:28.547
I guess I'm just going to
have to put you in a cab.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.050
I'm so sorry-- I was having
such a lovely evening.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.552
Well, maybe we could meet
for coffee tomorrow. Yes,

17:33.552 --> 17:35.554
um, all right, all right.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.056
Ah, thank you very much.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.058
Uh, yes, here, yeah, that's fine.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.060
You just keep the change. Uh, thank you.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.062
Uh, shall we?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.564
You know, I'm just going
to call a cab later.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.055
There's no sense all
this food going to waste.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.273
You know what? I-I can't leave.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.575
I can't. It would be rude.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.278
Oh, don't be silly. go . No, no.

17:59.278 --> 18:01.580
It's... it's not like
he's going anywhere anyway.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.583
(chuckling)

18:04.583 --> 18:08.287
Okay. Well, uh, are
you sure you're not hungry?

18:08.287 --> 18:10.289
You're welcome to try some of mine.

18:10.289 --> 18:11.590
Well, now that you mention it,

18:11.590 --> 18:13.592
uh, I guess I would like to try it.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.593
Yes, thank you.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.595
Well, help yourself. Mm-hmm.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.290
Okay, well, where were we?

18:18.597 --> 18:20.299
Oh, that's right. My husband.

18:20.299 --> 18:21.596
Anyway, he says he doesn't love me

18:22.301 --> 18:24.603
He's bored, blah, blah
, he's suffocating.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.594
If only, I say.

18:27.306 --> 18:29.608
I would have gotten a
nice little settlement.

18:29.608 --> 18:33.312
I mean, we were
covered up the yin-yang.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.303
He had a sweet whole-life policy

18:35.614 --> 18:38.310
that paid double for accidental death.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.315
I borrowed against it to get my Hyundai.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.613
Hey!

18:46.325 --> 18:47.622
Who's the ravioli monster?

18:49.328 --> 18:50.625
Roar.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.633
You're worried about
your brother, aren't you?

18:54.633 --> 18:56.328
Mm. Maybe we should just go.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.624
All right.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.639
Once again, I've had
such a lovely evening.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.674
(Ann laughs)

19:02.674 --> 19:05.577
I hope I didn't talk your ear off.

19:05.577 --> 19:08.280
I can still hear you, so no.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.282
(chuckles)

19:10.282 --> 19:12.284
gosh, you know, uh...

19:12.284 --> 19:14.586
I'm parked out back, so I'll
just slip out through the kitchen.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.281
I'm sure the valet can flag you a cab.

19:16.588 --> 19:17.589
Oh.

19:17.589 --> 19:20.292
Okay. Well...
here we are--

19:20.292 --> 19:22.594
the awkward part.

19:22.594 --> 19:23.595
Oh, it's not awkward at all.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.297
I'd be delighted to pay for your cab.

19:25.297 --> 19:26.594
Here we are. Bye-bye.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.303
(chuckling); I...
I hope I'm not too late

19:31.303 --> 19:32.604
You know, I think I talked her

19:32.604 --> 19:34.306
into taking that Seattle job.

19:34.306 --> 19:35.307
Oh, well,

19:35.307 --> 19:36.608
let me be the first to offer

19:36.608 --> 19:38.510
my congratulations... to Seattle.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.379
Thank you.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.880
And please let me offer my services

19:41.880 --> 19:44.616
as, uh... cultural attach?.

19:44.616 --> 19:46.451
Well, I would love that.

19:46.451 --> 19:48.009
I think this calls for a toast.

19:48.453 --> 19:49.943
May I see your list
of champagnes, please?

19:51.456 --> 19:52.457
Ann.

19:52.457 --> 19:53.959
I thought you left our date

19:53.959 --> 19:55.449
to go take care of your brother.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.462
Date? I-I thought you said

19:57.462 --> 20:00.265
you were just wrapping
up a business meeting.

20:00.265 --> 20:03.635
Is that why you ate all my raviolis?

20:03.635 --> 20:06.627
Because you were just
trying to get rid of me?

20:07.339 --> 20:08.340
No, no, of-of course not.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.342
Listen, there's a perfectly
logical explanation

20:10.342 --> 20:12.644
for all this, which is...

20:12.644 --> 20:14.635
I'm sorry. I've-I've got to take that.

20:16.648 --> 20:17.649
Hello?

20:17.649 --> 20:18.917
That didn't ring.

20:18.917 --> 20:21.477
It's very soft.

20:21.820 --> 20:24.323
FRASIER; Oh, gosh, Dad,

20:24.323 --> 20:25.824
that sounds serious.

20:25.824 --> 20:27.815
You stay put. I'll be right there.

20:28.327 --> 20:29.817
(phone rings) Ow! That's loud!

20:34.433 --> 20:36.924
Oh, Doc, what are you doing?

20:38.437 --> 20:41.429
This is exactly like my other date!

20:41.940 --> 20:44.443
Kenny, I think I'd like to get to
the airport a little early tonight.

20:44.443 --> 20:45.944
But, Miss Wright...

20:45.944 --> 20:46.945
I'll meet you out front.

20:46.945 --> 20:47.946
Excuse me.

20:47.946 --> 20:48.935
But, Liz...

20:50.449 --> 20:54.442
This one hurts, Doc.
I had a souffl? coming.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.326
. I'm sorry, Ann

21:01.326 --> 21:03.295
I'm sorry, too.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.297
Sorry for thinking you were different

21:05.297 --> 21:07.288
than all the other jerks out there.

21:07.599 --> 21:08.588
But you're not.

21:09.301 --> 21:12.304
You're just another
selfish, dishonest creep.

21:12.304 --> 21:15.607
 You're right. I don't know what to say

21:15.607 --> 21:17.609
Well, maybe you can
come up with something

21:17.609 --> 21:20.510
before we have coffee tomorrow.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.448
Are you seriously suggesting that...

21:24.783 --> 21:26.307
What?!

21:28.320 --> 21:29.621
See you at 1 0:00?

21:29.621 --> 21:32.317
Okay.

21:33.305 --> 21:39.732
