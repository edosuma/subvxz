WEBVTT

01:00.962 --> 01:02.362
You wanna keep him?

01:03.932 --> 01:05.432
What if he's lost?

01:37.865 --> 01:39.299
<i>Frankie, just wanted to call</i>

01:39.433 --> 01:41.836
<i>and wish you</i>
<i>a very happy birthday.</i>

01:42.102 --> 01:43.571
<i>I know it's been a minute.</i>

01:43.705 --> 01:45.472
<i>Saw that you and your mom</i>
<i>went on vacation.</i>

01:45.607 --> 01:47.407
<i>That looked nice.</i>

01:47.642 --> 01:50.078
<i>We should go on one,</i>
<i>one of these days.</i>

01:50.210 --> 01:51.846
<i>Hey, Franklin.</i>

01:51.980 --> 01:54.916
<i>Just wanted to say sorry again</i>
<i>that the whole Bahamas trip</i>

01:55.049 --> 01:56.350
<i>didn't pan out.</i>

01:56.483 --> 01:58.118
<i>The... the bombs</i>
<i>were totally fake.</i>

01:58.251 --> 02:00.454
<i>They... they lied. Idiots.</i>

02:00.655 --> 02:02.824
<i>Anyway, next year?</i>
<i>Love you.</i>

02:04.626 --> 02:06.193
<i>Hey, Frankie.</i>
<i>Not sure what your mom told you</i>

02:06.426 --> 02:07.729
<i>about what happened, but if you</i>
<i>give me a call I can explain</i>

02:07.862 --> 02:09.262
<i>my side of things.</i>

02:09.429 --> 02:10.732
<i>There's always two sides</i>
<i>to a story, okay?</i>

02:10.865 --> 02:12.533
<i>Gotta run. Uh, love you.</i>

02:12.667 --> 02:14.468
<i>Hey, Franklin, just wanted to</i>
<i>call and let you know</i>

02:14.602 --> 02:16.370
<i>that I wasn't lying</i>
<i>the other day.</i>

02:16.504 --> 02:20.808
<i>I was sick, and so that's why</i>
<i>I had to reschedule.</i>

02:20.942 --> 02:22.910
<i>Anyways, I don't wanna fight.</i>

02:23.443 --> 02:25.379
<i>I love you.</i>

02:25.546 --> 02:27.414
<i>Hey, Franklin, wanted to</i>
<i>give you a heads-up</i>

02:27.548 --> 02:29.550
<i>that I'm not gonna</i>
<i>be able to make it</i>

02:29.684 --> 02:31.418
<i>to your graduation today.</i>

02:31.552 --> 02:34.522
<i>Your mom and I, haven't been</i>
<i>in a good spot lately</i>

02:34.656 --> 02:36.356
<i>and I'm thinking</i>
<i>it's better we...</i>

02:37.125 --> 02:39.694
<i>do our own celebration</i>
<i>next time I see you.</i>

02:39.827 --> 02:43.531
<i>Anyways, hope you're well</i>
<i>and let's catch up soon.</i>

02:43.665 --> 02:45.232
<i>Love you.</i>

02:45.365 --> 02:47.669
<i>I am sorry I can't</i>
<i>be there because I would love</i>

02:47.802 --> 02:50.170
<i>to be there, I'm just asking,</i>
<i>please forgive me,</i>

02:50.303 --> 02:53.608
<i>forgive me on this one...</i>
<i>Just look the other way, okay?</i>

02:53.741 --> 02:54.842
<i>Please, don't count</i>
<i>this one against me.</i>

02:54.976 --> 02:56.144
<i>Call me if you'd like.</i>

02:56.276 --> 02:57.310
<i>All right, bye.</i>

02:57.578 --> 02:58.880
<i>Hey, Franklin,</i>

02:59.147 --> 03:01.348
<i>I didn't like the way</i>
<i>our last call went.</i>

03:01.481 --> 03:04.217
<i>I said some stuff</i>
<i>I shouldn't have said,</i>

03:04.351 --> 03:05.687
<i>and maybe you did too,</i>

03:05.820 --> 03:08.523
<i>and, I don't know,</i>
<i>I'm sorry about it.</i>

03:08.723 --> 03:10.323
<i>Father-son stuff</i>
<i>is tricky sometimes.</i>

03:10.457 --> 03:13.061
<i>Anyway, love you.</i>

03:13.427 --> 03:14.896
Being here
for the past few weeks

03:15.029 --> 03:18.198
has made me realize
suicide was never the answer.

03:18.733 --> 03:21.602
So, thank you all
for helping me through this.

03:26.841 --> 03:28.776
Does, uh, anyone else
have anything

03:28.910 --> 03:31.244
they wanna say
before we say our goodbyes?

03:33.114 --> 03:34.414
Franklin?

03:35.415 --> 03:36.718
Would you like to share?

03:37.051 --> 03:39.654
Oh, uh, no. No, thanks.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.322
Ooh, you sure?
It's the last day.

03:45.593 --> 03:50.565
I, uh, took some steps
in setting healthy boundaries

03:50.832 --> 03:54.301
and, uh,
blocked my dad online.

03:57.404 --> 04:01.308
<i>He lies and makes excuses.</i>

04:02.643 --> 04:04.045
<i>He's never really</i>
<i>been there for me</i>

04:04.277 --> 04:07.615
<i>when I needed him,</i>
<i>and I... I'm done with that.</i>

04:09.884 --> 04:11.018
<i>I don't need that</i>
<i>in my life right now.</i>

04:13.755 --> 04:15.355
- Thank you.
- That's great.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.392
Uh. Anyone else?

04:29.937 --> 04:31.271
Thanks again.

04:33.908 --> 04:37.277
How was that, uh,
closing ceremony thing?

04:37.745 --> 04:40.313
I love myself now.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.716
But it wasn't
as bad as you thought

04:41.849 --> 04:44.752
- it was gonna be, right?
- Hmm, yeah.

04:47.522 --> 04:48.890
All right.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.062
Can I try driving?

04:55.630 --> 04:57.899
Now? No,
you don't have a license.

04:58.099 --> 05:00.501
I know, but can I just try
for just one... just one part?

05:00.635 --> 05:02.603
In a crowded parking lot? No.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.005
- Right.
- No.

05:05.405 --> 05:07.407
Take care, Franklin!

05:50.017 --> 05:51.886
<i>Hey, uh, it's</i>
<i>Franklin Green's voicemail.</i>

05:52.019 --> 05:52.920
<i>Uh...</i>

05:53.054 --> 05:55.422
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.299
<i>Hey, uh, it's</i>
<i>Franklin Green's voicemail.</i>

06:05.432 --> 06:07.501
<i>Uh, I'm not here right now,</i>
<i>but leave a message</i>

06:07.635 --> 06:09.402
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

06:11.105 --> 06:13.507
<i>Hey, it's your dad. Um...</i>

06:13.641 --> 06:15.475
<i>Hey, did you delete</i>
<i>your profile?</i>

06:15.776 --> 06:18.478
Because it was kind of the...
kind of the main way

06:18.613 --> 06:20.114
I was staying
in touch with you.

06:21.883 --> 06:25.452
<i>I know it's not perfect,</i>
<i>but it's something.</i>

06:26.821 --> 06:29.090
<i>So, uh, let me know.</i>

06:29.557 --> 06:32.260
<i>And, um... I...</i>

06:32.392 --> 06:36.964
<i>and I love you,</i>
<i>and I'll talk to you soon.</i>

06:37.098 --> 06:38.398
I love you. Bye.

06:51.779 --> 06:54.649
- You all right, Chuck?
- Hey.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.518
No, seriously.
What's up, man?

06:58.853 --> 07:01.222
- What's up with what?
- You look sad as fuck.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.025
No, I don't. No.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.425
Nah... I'm pretty sure

07:05.559 --> 07:07.128
this is what a sad
motherfucker looks like.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.699
My, uh... ...son.
I've been trying to...

07:11.832 --> 07:13.267
trying to get in touch
with my son and...

07:13.401 --> 07:15.636
and he's been ignoring me.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.470
Ignoring you?

07:17.872 --> 07:21.909
And I think... I think...
I think he blocked me online.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.045
Okay.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.815
I mean, it happens. You know,
my ex blocked me one time

07:27.949 --> 07:30.885
and I just started a different
page under a different name,

07:31.252 --> 07:33.587
a whole different picture.
You know.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.922
I was checking her shit
all the time.

07:35.056 --> 07:36.891
She never even knew.

07:39.093 --> 07:40.661
Maybe you should
come to karaoke tonight.

07:40.795 --> 07:42.863
You know, it'll make you
feel better, man.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.832
Come sing with us
and have some fun.

07:44.966 --> 07:47.101
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah...

08:44.158 --> 08:45.793
Can I help you
with something?

08:47.762 --> 08:50.297
Can I help you with something?

08:51.198 --> 08:52.033
Uh...

08:52.166 --> 08:53.701
- You okay?
- I'm great.

08:53.834 --> 08:57.538
Uh, see here.
I'll probably get some coffee.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.308
Talkin' to people
is a good start.

09:02.243 --> 09:03.310
Yeah.

09:04.145 --> 09:06.914
Let me get you something.
See if we turn things around.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.149
Okay.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.251
- I'm Becca.
- I'm Chuck.

09:10.418 --> 09:11.585
Okay.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.669
<i>I just</i>
<i>started a different page</i>

09:28.803 --> 09:30.337
<i>under a different name,</i>

09:30.471 --> 09:32.840
<i>a whole different picture.</i>
<i>You know.</i>

09:34.375 --> 09:35.810
<i>She never even knew...</i>

10:10.545 --> 10:12.279
What's your name?

10:14.682 --> 10:17.318
- Becca.
- Becca what?

10:18.486 --> 10:20.121
Thompson.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.360
Soup?

12:07.461 --> 12:10.898
Nope. Nope!

12:11.298 --> 12:14.201
Oh, God. Uh-uh.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.471
Nope, I'm not...

12:34.488 --> 12:36.857
Hey, man...

12:51.939 --> 12:54.275
Shit.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.678
Sorry at work.

13:01.849 --> 13:05.452
Why am I your only friend?

13:07.988 --> 13:09.323
Fuck.

13:09.758 --> 13:12.493
My only friend. Come on.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.962
I'm...

13:19.433 --> 13:21.569
Deleted account,
started new one.

13:29.611 --> 13:31.478
Why'd I delete my account?

13:32.146 --> 13:34.014
Why'd I delete my account...

13:41.790 --> 13:44.291
We don't need have to chat.

14:28.536 --> 14:33.040
So? What do you, uh,
what do you think?

14:34.375 --> 14:36.143
This is the creepiest shit
I've ever seen ever,

14:36.276 --> 14:37.878
like for real.
This is creepy as fuck.

14:38.011 --> 14:41.816
What?
Thi... This was your idea.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.250
What d'you mean
this was my idea?

14:43.384 --> 14:45.720
That story
that you told about your...

14:45.854 --> 14:48.255
your ex and the account
you made.

14:48.389 --> 14:50.190
That was my ex-girlfriend.
This is your child.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.492
I am totally cut out!

14:51.626 --> 14:53.160
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

14:53.394 --> 14:54.928
Supposed to be cut out.
That's what bein' cut out is.

14:55.229 --> 14:56.463
They don't want to
talk to you.

14:56.798 --> 14:59.299
I just... I wanna know
what's going on in his life.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.068
Okay, Jimmy, the kid
tried to kill himself.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.837
I mean, what if he's already
masturbating to this?

15:03.270 --> 15:04.606
Give me the phone.

16:04.198 --> 16:07.502
<i>Sorry that was weird before.</i>

16:23.551 --> 16:26.253
You popped up
on my screen and...

16:27.054 --> 16:28.590
looked like someone
I could talk to.

16:36.531 --> 16:39.567
So out of the whole internet,
you started talking to me first?

16:42.637 --> 16:46.039
I was looking
for someone else.

16:53.815 --> 16:54.849
Saw we have...

16:55.382 --> 16:57.251
Saw we have the same dog.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.153
The same dog?

17:00.387 --> 17:02.790
- The same kind.
- Oh.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.393
And I thought you looked nice.

17:10.464 --> 17:13.467
Well...
this is definitely a first.

17:17.605 --> 17:19.039
So how's...

17:19.206 --> 17:20.675
So...

17:22.577 --> 17:25.178
- how's it goin'?
- Good.

17:27.749 --> 17:31.118
Actually, I was just about to
jump off my mom's roof.

17:37.692 --> 17:38.458
Just kidding.

17:38.626 --> 17:40.528
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

17:43.798 --> 17:45.198
I've been there.

17:46.668 --> 17:47.635
Um...

17:47.769 --> 17:49.804
Talkin' to people's
a good start.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.041
Talkin' to people's
a good start.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.510
As they say.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.554
How's it goin' with you?

18:13.861 --> 18:15.029
Family stuff.

18:15.597 --> 18:17.097
So, you're having
a great night too.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.399
The greatest.

18:28.810 --> 18:30.645
Anyway, it was good
talkin' to you.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.013
<i>...online presence.</i>

19:05.245 --> 19:07.414
<i>Who we are,</i>
<i>versus who we display?</i>

19:07.649 --> 19:10.852
<i>Off that topic of social media,</i>
<i>we're gonna bring you straight</i>

19:10.985 --> 19:15.288
<i>into Social Mania</i>
<i>with Samantha Jennings.</i>

19:35.710 --> 19:38.146
- I'm here!
- I'm here too.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.815
- Feelin' better today?
- I am, yeah.

19:41.248 --> 19:42.984
Listening to some public radio.

19:43.151 --> 19:44.217
Oh.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.486
- On... the radio.
- Hold on.

19:46.621 --> 19:47.989
<i>There was</i>
<i>always some excuse...</i>

19:48.122 --> 19:49.389
- Are you gonna...
- Yup.

19:49.924 --> 19:50.758
<i>And then I started</i>
<i>to realize...</i>

19:50.892 --> 19:51.959
Found it.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.828
<i>...that</i>
<i>he wasn't who he said he was.</i>

19:53.995 --> 19:57.632
<i>It was clear.</i>
<i>I was being catfished.</i>

19:57.832 --> 20:00.134
<i>This happened to me.</i>
<i>And it happens...</i>

20:00.267 --> 20:01.569
- Wow.
- I know.

20:01.936 --> 20:03.738
<i>A catfish</i>
<i>is someone who creates</i>

20:03.871 --> 20:06.406
- <i>a fake online identity...</i>
- This is extremely boring.

20:08.142 --> 20:09.110
So boring!

20:09.242 --> 20:10.778
These people are fucking idiots!

20:11.344 --> 20:14.749
Fuck these people!

20:15.049 --> 20:17.585
Do you mind if we listen
to something else?

20:19.053 --> 20:20.253
Yeah, sure.

20:20.454 --> 20:21.723
- Whatever you want.
- Yeah.

20:21.989 --> 20:23.191
<i>Nowadays, you never know</i>

20:23.323 --> 20:24.224
<i>who you might be talking to.</i>

20:36.704 --> 20:37.939
What you're working on?

20:38.072 --> 20:39.339
Oh, nothin', nothin'.

20:39.674 --> 20:43.111
- Just reports and stuff.
- Are you cheating on me?

20:43.945 --> 20:46.681
- Erica? What?
- Can I see your screen?

20:49.483 --> 20:51.485
- No.
- Why not?

20:52.385 --> 20:55.455
- Because.
- What? Are you fucking 12?

20:59.193 --> 21:01.328
I'm planning a date.

21:04.031 --> 21:04.932
For us.

21:05.233 --> 21:06.734
- Aw...
- Tonight.

21:07.068 --> 21:09.670
- Aw...
- Yeah.

21:11.973 --> 21:13.574
What'd you think
of those pictures?

21:13.808 --> 21:16.177
- Which ones?
- The ones of my pussy.

21:16.644 --> 21:18.813
- Oh. I liked them.
- Yeah? You liked them?

21:19.013 --> 21:21.816
- They turned me on.
- Open your mouth.

21:24.852 --> 21:26.020
Wider.

21:26.921 --> 21:28.321
Wider.

21:43.104 --> 21:45.472
So,
from what your mom tells me,

21:45.606 --> 21:47.975
- you're doing better.
- I think so. Yeah.

21:48.142 --> 21:49.744
Any thoughts of self-harm?

21:49.911 --> 21:53.281
- Oh, not really.
- Well. That's great.

21:53.681 --> 21:55.850
Yeah. Yeah. You know, we've been

21:55.983 --> 21:58.953
talkin' about
getting him back into school.

21:59.153 --> 22:02.190
I think local would be
a good idea at this time.

22:02.690 --> 22:04.357
And, um, you know,

22:04.491 --> 22:06.393
I still do lock up
the pills but...

22:06.527 --> 22:09.030
I feel more and more
comfortable about it.

22:09.230 --> 22:12.300
I think we're moving in
the right direction now, and...

22:12.465 --> 22:14.569
you know, he's never really
cared about it...

22:14.702 --> 22:17.004
Talking to him about
getting his driver's license...

22:20.675 --> 22:22.076
Uh, Franklin. Franklin?

22:23.578 --> 22:26.848
- How's that sound?
- I totally agree.

23:05.485 --> 23:06.888
This is my favorite movie.

23:07.021 --> 23:08.289
This is my favorite movie
in the entire world.

23:08.421 --> 23:09.957
- This is it?
- This is it!

23:10.591 --> 23:11.692
Oh my God.

23:11.826 --> 23:13.995
No. No, no, no.

23:21.302 --> 23:22.603
Okay, so...

23:22.737 --> 23:24.572
You pretty much
just have to keep going,

23:24.705 --> 23:26.307
and that's that whole game.

23:26.439 --> 23:27.675
Can I try?

23:27.942 --> 23:29.076
- If you want.
- Just keep going?

23:29.210 --> 23:30.443
Yeah, just keep goin'.

24:25.166 --> 24:27.835
You are really good
at that game.

24:27.969 --> 24:29.203
You were getting
pretty good too.

24:29.337 --> 24:31.238
I saw on your page
you won an award for it?

24:31.539 --> 24:33.641
Yeah, it's kinda stupid, though.

24:33.774 --> 24:35.576
- Why is it stupid?
- I don't know.

24:35.776 --> 24:37.645
I guess I've always
wanted to be like...

24:39.380 --> 24:40.748
a video game coder.

24:41.082 --> 24:43.818
Okay. You should
apply to some places

24:43.951 --> 24:45.386
for like an internship
or something.

24:45.853 --> 24:47.822
What's funny?

24:48.022 --> 24:50.524
I didn't know what else to say,
so I just typed "Haha."

24:53.027 --> 24:54.095
Hahaha.

24:55.363 --> 24:56.964
Hahaha.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.033
Hahahahaha.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.103
Hahahahaha.

25:02.236 --> 25:04.438
Hahahahahaha.

25:04.572 --> 25:07.508
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.

25:07.641 --> 25:09.210
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha.

25:09.343 --> 25:11.212
Hahahahahahahahahahaha.

25:13.481 --> 25:14.749
What?

25:16.517 --> 25:19.787
I, uh... I met someone.

25:21.555 --> 25:22.757
Online.

25:23.824 --> 25:28.029
Oh. Really?
Um, what's her name?

25:28.662 --> 25:32.133
- Becca. Thompson.
- Hmm.

25:32.366 --> 25:33.901
I don't know.
There's something about her.

25:34.035 --> 25:38.305
She's like... really smart.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.041
<i>Funny.</i>

25:41.976 --> 25:44.145
I don't know. She's just like...

25:46.247 --> 25:47.381
<i>cool.</i>

25:48.115 --> 25:50.151
And you've like talked to her
on the phone and stuff?

25:52.787 --> 25:54.455
Obviously.

25:54.922 --> 25:59.293
Cool. That's really...
it's exciting news.

25:59.827 --> 26:03.431
Wow, online. Like through
friends or just random?

26:49.477 --> 26:54.715
So. I... I told some
of my tech friends about you.

26:55.916 --> 26:58.319
Seriously?

26:59.653 --> 27:01.689
I hope you don't mind.

27:01.822 --> 27:04.158
No, no. That's... thank you.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.860
That's awesome.

27:09.797 --> 27:11.031
What's up?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.869
Do you wanna video chat?

27:15.803 --> 27:17.972
- N... Now?
- Sure.

27:18.973 --> 27:20.407
I'm kind of camera-shy.

27:20.542 --> 27:21.709
I am, too.

27:21.876 --> 27:22.977
Well, what if
we just keep to this?

27:23.277 --> 27:25.045
What if you're
some old guy or something?

27:30.985 --> 27:33.120
Chuck. This is incest.

27:33.254 --> 27:36.023
No, Jimmy, it's not.
I'm doing this to help him.

27:36.157 --> 27:37.758
He thinks
he's in a relationship.

27:37.892 --> 27:39.827
Yeah, we talk
about life and stuff.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.530
It's not like
I'm trying to see his dick.

27:41.695 --> 27:42.863
Oh, come on now.

27:43.264 --> 27:44.798
I don't want to hear nothin'
about your boy's dick.

27:44.932 --> 27:45.900
That's your son's dick
you're talkin' about.

27:46.033 --> 27:47.401
I said I'm not trying to.

27:48.068 --> 27:50.404
If I stop now, it'll crush him.

27:51.472 --> 27:53.073
I need to see it through.

27:54.842 --> 27:56.210
Camera's broke.

27:58.647 --> 28:00.649
I'm video chatting you.

28:01.215 --> 28:02.617
- Right now?
- Yes.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.151
It says it's calling you.

28:04.852 --> 28:07.922
It's not comin' through.

28:08.355 --> 28:09.990
It's still not working?

28:10.659 --> 28:12.960
It's, uh, it's being weird.

28:13.394 --> 28:15.429
I... I'll take my phone
in today.

28:15.796 --> 28:17.164
Okay.

28:20.234 --> 28:21.268
Sorry.

28:22.336 --> 28:23.437
Hey.

28:24.438 --> 28:26.807
- Hey.
- I like you.

28:29.076 --> 28:33.480
- I like you too.
- Can I... pretend kiss you?

28:36.717 --> 28:38.786
Look, you asked for my help.
Internet kiss your son.

28:38.953 --> 28:40.321
- Eww!
- Come on. Who cares?

28:40.555 --> 28:42.189
- It's not even real!
- You kiss your son, you fuck!

28:42.323 --> 28:43.257
If I had a son,

28:43.390 --> 28:44.391
- I would kiss him!
- That's gross!

28:44.758 --> 28:45.893
Damn it!
Look, do you love him?

28:46.193 --> 28:47.294
- Yes!
- How much?

28:47.461 --> 28:50.364
- A lot!
- Then fucking kiss him already!

28:52.667 --> 28:53.767
So...

29:04.812 --> 29:06.480
I'm kissing you.

29:10.951 --> 29:12.853
And I'm kissing you back.

29:30.705 --> 29:32.973
Franklin.

29:45.919 --> 29:47.421
Oh... God.

29:47.689 --> 29:48.623
Hey!

29:48.889 --> 29:50.791
Yeah. What's up?

29:51.025 --> 29:53.561
Hey, would you be up
for a quick phone call?

29:54.461 --> 29:55.829
- Uh...
- It's just a little weird

29:55.963 --> 29:57.264
that we've never
actually talked.

29:57.398 --> 29:59.433
And it'd make me feel
a lot better if we did.

29:59.734 --> 30:01.969
I'm just really busy right now.

30:03.203 --> 30:05.039
Then maybe we should
wait to keep messaging

30:05.172 --> 30:06.708
until you can chat.

30:07.374 --> 30:10.010
But we were
having such a fun time.

30:10.344 --> 30:11.513
Let me know.

30:39.808 --> 30:42.510
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:43.243 --> 30:47.848
- I have a really fun idea.
- I'll do anything with you.

30:48.683 --> 30:50.918
- It's kinda weird.
- I like weird.

30:51.118 --> 30:53.621
All right. So, um...

30:54.021 --> 30:57.826
...my... my son and I have this
weird tradition where we like,

30:58.025 --> 30:59.193
you know,
prank call each other,

30:59.360 --> 31:02.062
and I thought
it would be really funny

31:02.196 --> 31:04.632
if we like prank called him
as his girlfriend.

31:04.766 --> 31:07.569
You know, really, you know,
make him believe that it's her.

31:07.702 --> 31:09.036
And then, later on,
I could be like,

31:09.169 --> 31:12.973
"That was me."

31:13.575 --> 31:17.846
Wouldn't he know...
it wasn't her?

31:17.978 --> 31:19.279
That's the thing.
They've never met.

31:19.413 --> 31:21.583
He just knows her online.

31:22.182 --> 31:25.152
- Huh.
- And I was wondering...

31:25.787 --> 31:30.725
it would add a little...
authenticity to the prank.

31:31.458 --> 31:34.061
Could you call him
and be the voice?

31:34.194 --> 31:37.097
- I don't want to do that.
- Erica. It's really,
really fun.

31:37.231 --> 31:38.365
That sounds mean and stupid.

31:38.499 --> 31:40.802
No, no, no.
He... he does it to me.

31:40.934 --> 31:42.169
It's like our thing.

31:42.604 --> 31:45.172
One time, he prank called me
pretending to be my ex-wife.

31:45.305 --> 31:48.442
I was like,
"What? No way!"

31:55.416 --> 31:56.785
It sounds like
you're literally

31:56.917 --> 31:58.419
making this up right now.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.054
Thought this would
actually be a fun way to...

32:01.355 --> 32:03.658
kind of bring you
into my life more, but...

32:08.195 --> 32:09.898
I'll do it
if you sext me at work.

32:10.364 --> 32:11.599
Oh... I don't like doing that.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.500
Hmm... I don't like
doing made-up pranks

32:13.635 --> 32:15.335
to people's kids I've never met
that don't make any sense.

32:15.469 --> 32:17.772
Why don't we
just have regular sex?

32:17.906 --> 32:20.307
Because. You're not good at it.

32:43.130 --> 32:44.331
Hello?

32:45.667 --> 32:47.434
- Is this...
<i>- Franklin?</i>

32:47.802 --> 32:49.671
<i>Is... is this a good time?</i>

32:50.304 --> 32:52.306
Yeah, I was just... yeah, sorry.

32:52.439 --> 32:53.842
I... I was... I was just...
I was literally just

32:54.007 --> 32:55.944
<i>in the middle... uh, yeah.</i>
<i>What's goin' on?</i>

32:56.076 --> 32:57.411
Uh, how's your day going?

32:57.645 --> 33:00.214
<i>Pretty good.</i>
<i>How's it goin' with you?</i>

33:00.981 --> 33:02.416
What are you wearing?

33:05.052 --> 33:07.589
Just sweatpants
and a Red Sox shirt.

33:07.722 --> 33:11.526
- Uh, what... what about you?
- Just a dress.

33:11.659 --> 33:14.428
<i>- Oh, awesome.</i>
- No panties.

33:18.298 --> 33:20.234
- Sorry?
- Just got out of the shower.

33:20.501 --> 33:23.403
Oh, hopefully you did
your laundry so that...

33:24.071 --> 33:25.707
there are clean towels.

33:29.176 --> 33:30.712
Your voice is sexy.

33:31.278 --> 33:33.046
<i>I'm actually</i>
<i>not good on the phone.</i>

33:33.380 --> 33:34.949
- <i>Uh, to be totally honest.</i>
- What?

33:35.249 --> 33:36.684
Me neither.

33:37.217 --> 33:38.620
Do you want to
just meet in person?

33:38.753 --> 33:40.788
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Sure, I'd love to.

33:40.989 --> 33:44.057
<i>Okay, awesome.</i>
<i>Uh, see you soon.</i>

33:44.224 --> 33:46.093
Sounds great. See you soon.

33:48.530 --> 33:50.665
- What was that?
- Yeah. What the fuck was that?

33:50.798 --> 33:53.668
- It was a game.
- Tell me the truth.

33:53.968 --> 33:55.168
- I told you that...
- No.

33:57.605 --> 34:01.475
Look, whatever it is, it's okay.

34:02.977 --> 34:06.014
I'll understand.

34:06.781 --> 34:09.082
- Get the fuck out!
- You said it would be okay!

34:09.216 --> 34:10.384
You're a piece of shit!

34:10.752 --> 34:12.954
Lying to your son isn't
gonna get you closer to him!

34:13.086 --> 34:16.223
Well, it might.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.902
I can't wait to meet you.

34:41.716 --> 34:45.485
Your counselor said that you
can't travel alone for a year.

34:45.620 --> 34:47.889
And... and you don't even have
your driver's license.

34:48.022 --> 34:49.023
Can you drive me then?

34:49.156 --> 34:50.625
Can I take you to meet this...?

34:50.758 --> 34:52.560
- No, I can't. I'm sorry.
- It'll be fun.

34:52.694 --> 34:55.863
I have a practice.
I can't just pick up and leave.

34:55.997 --> 34:57.331
But I'll get permission

34:57.532 --> 35:00.133
from my treatment team
and everything. I promise.

35:04.539 --> 35:05.540
Please.

35:06.908 --> 35:08.241
I'm sorry, honey.

35:11.980 --> 35:15.650
- I can't believe she said no.
- I know. I...

35:46.881 --> 35:48.248
Hello?

35:49.117 --> 35:51.284
- Dad?
- Hey.

35:51.552 --> 35:55.623
- Um, what's goin' on?
- I think I need a ride.

35:57.125 --> 35:58.258
Where?

35:58.492 --> 36:00.662
<i>To meet a girl in Maine.</i>

36:01.294 --> 36:02.530
<i>Near you.</i>

36:06.601 --> 36:08.903
- It's too far.
- No, no. Uh, I just...

36:09.037 --> 36:10.370
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to explain.</i>

36:10.738 --> 36:12.239
<i>There's just</i>
<i>a lot of work stuff.</i>

36:12.372 --> 36:13.608
Don't.

36:20.782 --> 36:22.315
<i>I just think it's very cool</i>

36:22.449 --> 36:24.018
<i>that he's willing</i>
<i>to drive all that way.</i>

36:24.786 --> 36:25.920
I mean, what,
he's got to drive

36:26.087 --> 36:27.320
all the way down to you,

36:27.555 --> 36:29.891
and then all the way back
to where he lives.

36:30.792 --> 36:32.627
He must care a lot about you.

36:34.996 --> 36:36.931
Becca, my dad is fucked up.

36:37.598 --> 36:39.232
He's got something
wrong with him.

36:39.701 --> 36:42.070
Everyone's got something, right?

36:42.202 --> 36:43.370
Yeah, but I don't even...

36:43.504 --> 36:45.173
I feel like I don't even
know who he...

36:45.305 --> 36:46.741
like everything he does
is bullshit.

36:46.874 --> 36:49.744
He's like, he...
he's a compulsive liar.

36:54.749 --> 36:57.118
He doesn't sound
that bad.

36:57.719 --> 37:00.722
Let me...
I mean, what's a good...

37:00.855 --> 37:04.092
okay, this is a dumb thing,
but I feel like it...

37:04.926 --> 37:07.662
He used to be obsessed
with online chess.

37:07.829 --> 37:10.631
- We should play.
- Um... Maybe later.

37:11.032 --> 37:11.966
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:12.133 --> 37:13.134
Okay.

37:13.735 --> 37:15.937
Anyway, he was playing
all the time,

37:16.070 --> 37:18.206
and was the top of
all these online leagues,

37:18.338 --> 37:19.473
he was winning
all these awards...

37:19.607 --> 37:21.241
Wow. I mean,
I would be super proud.

37:21.408 --> 37:24.244
But then one day, he shows me
how he's winning so much.

37:24.411 --> 37:25.580
And what he would do is

37:25.713 --> 37:26.881
he would play
against somebody online,

37:27.014 --> 37:28.315
but then be playing
the same game

37:28.448 --> 37:29.684
against a computer.

37:30.184 --> 37:32.954
Whatever move this guy makes,
I use that move in this game.

37:33.087 --> 37:34.522
<i>And he would</i>
<i>the players' moves</i>

37:34.822 --> 37:36.389
<i>and use them</i>
<i>against the computer</i>

37:36.524 --> 37:38.492
<i>and then take the computer's</i>
<i>perfect moves,</i>

37:38.626 --> 37:40.094
<i>and then use them back</i>
<i>against the player.</i>

37:40.228 --> 37:41.796
And they just play against
each other the whole time.

37:41.963 --> 37:43.898
And then I'm just moving
right up the leaderboards.

37:44.031 --> 37:45.365
He'd just cheat.

37:46.834 --> 37:48.936
And that was how he did
his whole life.

37:53.708 --> 37:55.543
I'm taking a road trip
with my son.

37:55.676 --> 37:59.446
<i>- Chuck, she's not real!</i>
- My Becca's not real!

37:59.580 --> 38:00.915
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>

38:01.048 --> 38:03.618
I'm going to introduce him
to the real Becca.

38:03.751 --> 38:05.953
- The one from the diner.
<i>- Abort!</i>

38:06.087 --> 38:07.522
Let me explain!

38:07.655 --> 38:09.190
<i>So your plan</i>
<i>is to introduce your son</i>

38:09.322 --> 38:10.357
<i>to this random diner girl.</i>

38:10.490 --> 38:11.893
She's a nice girl.

38:12.026 --> 38:13.795
He's a great kid.
And they're gonna hit it off!

38:13.928 --> 38:15.630
<i>She's a total stranger!</i>

38:15.763 --> 38:16.898
She's not.
She's a nice girl

38:17.031 --> 38:18.666
who makes faces at kids.
She's funny.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.400
<i>You're about to ruin</i>
<i>your son's life!</i>

38:20.835 --> 38:21.869
I'm here.

38:22.036 --> 38:23.604
<i>Chuck,</i>
<i>listen to me, okay?</i>

38:23.738 --> 38:24.906
<i>Come clean.</i>
<i>Just tell him everything.</i>

38:25.173 --> 38:26.941
<i>Tell him</i>
<i>and face the consequences,</i>

38:27.208 --> 38:28.543
<i>but don't do this.</i>
<i>Don't be a fucking</i>
<i>idiot, Chuck!</i>

38:28.709 --> 38:30.011
Whatever it takes, Jimmy.

38:30.443 --> 38:32.379
<i>- He's gonna find out!</i>
- Whatever it takes.

38:33.114 --> 38:35.482
He's just, uh,
finishing packing up.

38:35.716 --> 38:36.951
Place looks great!

38:37.084 --> 38:39.554
I love what you did
with the... lawn.

38:39.754 --> 38:41.189
This whole thing is a dumb idea.

38:41.488 --> 38:42.824
And he doesn't even
know this girl,

38:42.957 --> 38:45.293
- she could be anybody.
- Totally agree.

38:45.793 --> 38:47.795
I'm gonna to talk him.
I'm gonna engage.

38:48.129 --> 38:49.664
- There he is!
- Got everything?

38:50.298 --> 38:52.767
Come here. Okay. Love you.

38:52.900 --> 38:53.968
Love you too.

38:54.434 --> 38:56.971
- Here.
- I... I got it.

38:57.505 --> 38:58.706
Yeah.

38:59.874 --> 39:01.809
This could be
incredibly destabilizing.

39:02.243 --> 39:03.476
I know.

39:03.744 --> 39:06.013
If anything goes wrong,
it's your responsibility.

39:06.914 --> 39:08.015
Trusting you.

39:30.104 --> 39:33.107
- So, how's it bein' back home?
- Good.

39:33.808 --> 39:35.276
What kind of stuff you doin'?

39:36.077 --> 39:39.714
- I don't know.
- Watching anything good on TV?

39:41.716 --> 39:44.085
So many shows out now, you know?

39:45.853 --> 39:48.122
Think there'll be
even more shows?

39:49.657 --> 39:51.225
Like, in the future?

39:51.359 --> 39:53.561
Do I think there will be even
more TV shows in the future?

39:53.694 --> 39:55.062
That's what
you're asking right now?

39:55.395 --> 39:57.031
- Yeah, I don't... I don't know.
- Why are you asking me that?

39:57.164 --> 39:58.733
Well, what do you
wanna talk about?

39:58.900 --> 40:01.068
- Nothing.
- You coding maybe?

40:04.338 --> 40:05.940
How do you know about my coding?

40:07.708 --> 40:09.977
I don't know.
Your mom or something.

40:44.679 --> 40:46.113
Oh, it's my girlfriend.

40:47.014 --> 40:49.617
All right, one sec.

40:51.352 --> 40:53.020
Hello? Becca?

40:53.321 --> 40:54.789
Becca? Hello?

40:55.589 --> 40:56.891
Hey, can you hear me?

40:57.024 --> 41:00.895
Hello? Hello?
Hello, Becca?

41:01.028 --> 41:02.462
So, I... I can just hear myself.

41:02.697 --> 41:04.565
I can't... hey, hello?
Hello? I'll... I'll call.

41:04.699 --> 41:07.335
Uh, call me.
I'll call you in a little bit.

41:08.269 --> 41:10.771
Okay. If you can hear me,
okay, bye.

41:13.741 --> 41:16.644
Not there, huh?

41:44.972 --> 41:46.307
You ready, bud?

41:47.108 --> 41:48.576
- Hey, you ready?
- What are you...

41:48.943 --> 41:51.946
- Can you please not do that?
- Oh, sorry.

42:09.563 --> 42:10.965
Okay.

42:12.666 --> 42:15.836
What are you wearing?

42:26.947 --> 42:28.549
<i>What are you wearing?</i>

42:43.931 --> 42:46.100
I'm in my underwear.

42:51.005 --> 42:53.040
<i>I'm in my underwear.</i>

43:00.114 --> 43:01.882
What am I doing?

43:02.016 --> 43:04.351
What am I doing?

43:06.287 --> 43:07.788
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>I was trying to talk dirty</i>

43:07.922 --> 43:09.824
<i>like you did on our phone call.</i>

43:15.262 --> 43:17.932
<i>I was being crazy.</i>
<i>I'm not really like that.</i>

43:19.967 --> 43:21.602
<i>It's fine if you don't want to.</i>

43:23.304 --> 43:25.272
<i>I think it's better</i>
<i>if we wait.</i>

43:30.077 --> 43:31.879
<i>I get it. I'm a loser.</i>

43:32.514 --> 43:34.915
<i>You're not a loser.</i>

43:35.216 --> 43:38.719
<i>I am, actually.</i>
<i>I am a fucking loser.</i>

43:55.236 --> 43:56.571
<i>- I'm in here.</i>
- Yeah. Uh...

43:56.704 --> 43:57.905
<i>How much longer?</i>

43:58.172 --> 44:00.107
- I don't know.
<i>- Okay. I just, um...</i>

44:01.308 --> 44:04.411
I just wanted to let you know
that I think you're awesome.

44:04.678 --> 44:06.814
Why're... Thank you.

44:12.621 --> 44:13.821
<i>I hate myself.</i>

44:23.864 --> 44:25.432
Whatever move
this guy makes,

44:25.567 --> 44:27.334
I use that move in this game.

44:27.569 --> 44:29.538
And then whatever move
he makes against that move,

44:29.670 --> 44:32.706
I use it back on this game.
I make the guys play each other.

44:32.840 --> 44:34.509
They think they're playin' me.

44:51.091 --> 44:52.393
<i>Hey, you there?</i>

44:55.229 --> 44:57.198
<i>What?</i>

44:57.331 --> 44:59.800
<i>I deleted</i>
<i>the account and everything.</i>

44:59.934 --> 45:02.136
<i>You were right.</i>

45:02.336 --> 45:04.972
<i>You promise?</i>

45:05.105 --> 45:07.474
<i>What you said</i>
<i>made an impact on me.</i>

45:08.442 --> 45:10.311
<i>Wow.</i>

45:10.444 --> 45:13.247
<i>And...</i>
<i>I owe you something.</i>

45:15.449 --> 45:16.784
<i>Make me want it.</i>

45:24.091 --> 45:25.859
I'm in my underwear.

45:27.828 --> 45:31.031
Well, that turns me on.

45:39.773 --> 45:42.876
Well, that turns me on.

45:44.111 --> 45:46.615
About wearing underwear.

46:15.744 --> 46:17.444
What do you wanna do to me?

46:25.520 --> 46:27.722
Paste. Send.

46:27.988 --> 46:29.990
What do you wanna do to me?

46:31.760 --> 46:33.127
I'm kissing you.

46:40.602 --> 46:42.036
All over.

46:54.848 --> 46:56.417
What are you
doing to me?

46:57.217 --> 46:58.787
Kissing you all over.

46:59.186 --> 47:01.388
Don't be a fucking pussy, Chuck.

47:01.623 --> 47:02.856
What are you doin' to me?

47:03.290 --> 47:05.993
I'm sliding my hand
around your cock.

47:14.101 --> 47:16.170
I'm sliding my hand
around your cock.

47:16.370 --> 47:19.206
I'm kinda moving
my body back and forth

47:19.340 --> 47:20.675
so your hand doesn't get tired.

47:20.874 --> 47:23.477
Back and forth to...

47:25.379 --> 47:26.614
Okay.

47:28.482 --> 47:31.251
And I'm kinda moving
my body back and forth

47:31.385 --> 47:33.253
so your hand
doesn't get tired.

47:33.755 --> 47:35.456
Now I'm using my mouth.

47:38.992 --> 47:41.061
Now I'm using my mouth.

47:43.397 --> 47:45.299
I'm seriously
so erect right now.

47:47.535 --> 47:50.003
I'm seriously
so erect right now.

47:51.506 --> 47:52.607
What?

47:57.679 --> 47:58.680
What?

47:59.848 --> 48:04.451
- Like... your boobs?
- Yeah, my boobs are erect.

48:06.621 --> 48:08.222
Oh, I didn't know
you were so good...

48:08.389 --> 48:09.791
- ...at doing this.
- You feel so good inside me.

48:09.957 --> 48:12.326
- You feel so good too.
- God, I want you inside me.

48:12.459 --> 48:13.894
- I thought I was.
- You are.

48:14.128 --> 48:17.297
I'm imagining it.

48:31.513 --> 48:33.180
Franklin,
I gotta use the bathroom.

48:33.313 --> 48:35.449
<i>- One second.</i>
- No, right now! I gotta go!

48:35.683 --> 48:37.719
- I said one second!
- Franklin!

48:37.852 --> 48:39.019
What the fuck!

48:39.186 --> 48:40.320
Hey, I just gotta
use the bathroom.

48:40.522 --> 48:41.656
Can't I just have
a fucking second?

48:41.790 --> 48:43.223
Whoa, where is this coming from?

48:43.357 --> 48:44.224
- You're smothering me.
- I'm... I'm smothering you?

48:44.391 --> 48:45.560
You're smothering me!

48:45.727 --> 48:47.127
I haven't seen you
in a year.

48:47.494 --> 48:48.630
- Yeah, whose fault is that?
- Oh, my God.

48:48.763 --> 48:50.097
Oh, you think this is funny?

48:50.297 --> 48:52.567
I send you a billion messages.
I never hear back.

48:52.700 --> 48:54.134
'Cause that's all you do.

48:54.268 --> 48:55.837
That's all you do.
You post on my wall.

48:56.003 --> 48:57.404
- You think that's showing up?
- Your wife and kid hate you,

48:57.539 --> 48:58.907
how fun you think it is
to show up?

48:59.039 --> 49:00.407
That's what you signed up for.

49:00.575 --> 49:03.645
- I signed up for a family.
- I am your family!

49:07.749 --> 49:09.851
We're both
really tired right now...

49:09.983 --> 49:11.753
I'm tired of pretending
we're okay.

49:12.352 --> 49:13.888
You want to know
why I cut you out?

49:14.021 --> 49:15.122
Because you're a liar.

49:15.289 --> 49:16.423
You're selfish
and you're a liar.

49:16.558 --> 49:17.491
Come on.

49:17.892 --> 49:19.193
Every time you said
you'd be there, you never were.

49:19.326 --> 49:20.562
Every time
you could have shown up,

49:20.728 --> 49:22.564
you just cut corners
and I'm sick of it!

49:22.697 --> 49:25.432
- Frank... Franklin...
- I needed you.

49:25.700 --> 49:27.034
And you weren't there.

49:28.168 --> 49:29.369
You weren't there.

49:31.038 --> 49:32.239
I'm not perfect.

49:32.574 --> 49:33.942
- You're not fucking perfect.
- I just...

49:34.074 --> 49:35.242
yeah,
I just said I wasn't, okay?

49:35.375 --> 49:36.477
- I'm trying.
- You're really not.

49:36.644 --> 49:37.679
I'm here...now.
If... if I gotta...

49:38.278 --> 49:40.214
do every little thing
for the rest of my life

49:40.347 --> 49:42.049
to make up for it, I will.

49:44.752 --> 49:47.822
Let's... let's just, uh,
like talk to each other. Okay?

49:48.355 --> 49:49.858
You sit there
on the other chair.

49:50.023 --> 49:51.391
We can sit and talk, all right?

50:01.970 --> 50:03.203
I'm trying to rebuild

50:03.337 --> 50:05.607
from a thing
that I know that I broke.

50:06.908 --> 50:07.909
I broke it.

50:09.042 --> 50:11.546
And this is the... this is me
doing my best to fix it.

50:11.679 --> 50:14.348
Mom was right. This whole thing
was a bad idea.

50:18.485 --> 50:21.021
Franklin.

51:31.960 --> 51:33.260
You wanna try?

51:33.962 --> 51:35.195
Try what?

51:35.763 --> 51:36.764
Driving.

51:39.466 --> 51:41.468
- No.
- Come on.

51:44.438 --> 51:47.441
- I never got my license.
- It's easy.

52:02.824 --> 52:04.124
Let's switch.

52:11.733 --> 52:13.534
- Friend...
- Dad, no.

52:22.877 --> 52:25.046
All right,
foot on the brake

52:25.212 --> 52:26.981
and put it in drive.

52:27.115 --> 52:29.149
Okay. When do I...

52:29.316 --> 52:30.518
Just give it...
give it some gas.

52:30.652 --> 52:31.953
Foot on the gas pedal
right there.

52:32.887 --> 52:34.856
Stop. Stop, stop, stop
till you have an opening.

52:35.056 --> 52:37.992
- Okay.
- No, stop. Stop. No.

52:38.126 --> 52:40.160
This guy's a fuckin' asshole.
Foot on the brake.

52:40.293 --> 52:41.796
There you go, there you go.

52:53.173 --> 52:56.176
Franklin, you're a natural.
You're a natural at this.

52:56.944 --> 52:58.613
I was a mess
the first time I did this.

52:58.746 --> 52:59.781
Oh my God.

52:59.914 --> 53:01.314
Okay, we're gonna
switch lanes again.

53:01.448 --> 53:02.884
I want you to get
in the left lane.

53:03.151 --> 53:04.585
- Okay. Left lane.
- There you go.
There's the signal.

53:04.719 --> 53:06.420
Check your mirrors.
Everything clear?

53:06.821 --> 53:08.956
- All right, go to the left.
- Check. Moving to left.

53:09.090 --> 53:10.692
- I'm moving to left.
- And now turn your signal off

53:10.825 --> 53:12.627
'cause you're in the left lane,
and you did it.

53:12.794 --> 53:14.929
- What do all the lights mean?
- Which ones?

53:15.063 --> 53:18.432
The one with the...
the engine light.

53:18.666 --> 53:20.101
Oh, that thing's
been on for a while.

53:20.233 --> 53:21.501
That... that's just to...

53:21.636 --> 53:22.937
the manufacturers
make that thing go on

53:23.071 --> 53:24.872
so you'll go in
and pay for more repairs.

53:25.006 --> 53:26.273
It's nothing.

53:27.441 --> 53:28.743
Just go straight that way.

53:28.943 --> 53:30.377
That parking space
straight ahead,

53:30.511 --> 53:31.679
straight ahead.

53:31.813 --> 53:34.082
There you go
and put the brake pad.

53:34.214 --> 53:36.684
And put it in park.

53:36.884 --> 53:37.952
Welcome home.

53:51.231 --> 53:52.934
Right over there.
Straight ahead.

53:57.872 --> 54:01.274
- You still have that thing?
- I'm never getting rid of this.

54:05.546 --> 54:06.814
You want it?

54:08.448 --> 54:10.952
- What do you mean?
- The car. To keep.

54:11.886 --> 54:12.887
It's yours.

54:17.390 --> 54:18.593
Okay.

54:45.219 --> 54:47.789
<i>I can't stop</i>
<i>thinkin' about last night.</i>

54:50.691 --> 54:52.425
<i>You were amazing.</i>

54:53.694 --> 54:54.962
<i>How was the trip?</i>

54:55.163 --> 54:56.597
<i>Want to finish</i>
<i>what we started?</i>

54:56.731 --> 54:58.633
<i>Can't do that right now. Sorry.</i>

54:59.233 --> 55:02.170
You're lucky you get to spend
all this time with your dad.

55:02.302 --> 55:04.906
Yeah, well, if you knew him,
you'd think different.

55:07.608 --> 55:10.343
My dad and I fought a lot
before he passed away.

55:11.245 --> 55:12.613
It wasn't worth it.

55:13.480 --> 55:15.382
Oh my God, Becca. I'm so sorry.

55:15.516 --> 55:18.252
I... I feel like an idiot.
I had no idea.

55:18.586 --> 55:20.822
Yeah, he wasn't
always around either.

55:22.389 --> 55:26.093
And then one day
we were having this...

55:26.861 --> 55:30.497
...big stupid fight and...

55:34.235 --> 55:35.903
and then he just died.

55:37.337 --> 55:38.371
Heart attack.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.741
And I never saw him again.

55:41.209 --> 55:43.077
And I will never see him again.

55:43.778 --> 55:46.948
Oh, my God, Becca.

55:47.315 --> 55:51.219
And then, you know,
when I started missing him,

55:51.351 --> 55:54.021
I just... I wanted to call.

55:55.790 --> 55:57.191
And I... I couldn't.

55:57.758 --> 56:01.896
I tried. I called
over and over but...

56:04.565 --> 56:05.900
he was gone.

56:13.875 --> 56:16.344
Through that experience,
I realized

56:16.476 --> 56:18.846
that I should have
just forgiven him.

56:20.147 --> 56:24.484
And, uh, I also realized
that I love him

56:24.619 --> 56:27.154
way more than
I love my mom. So.

56:30.423 --> 56:31.592
Huh.

56:34.262 --> 56:35.563
Wow. That's...

56:37.198 --> 56:38.666
Wow.

56:41.736 --> 56:44.572
Remember, your dad
was just some guy

56:44.705 --> 56:48.542
who ended up having a kid
and is now just...

56:49.543 --> 56:51.012
trying his best.

56:59.186 --> 57:02.623
Um, apples and peanut butter
almost done.

57:21.108 --> 57:22.109
Night.

57:29.183 --> 57:30.651
Good night, Franklin.

57:40.061 --> 57:42.596
<i>Derek, you are</i>
<i>the most thoughtful,</i>

57:42.763 --> 57:46.067
<i>unique, and kind person</i>
<i>I've ever met. And...</i>

57:46.534 --> 57:47.935
<i>I love you.</i>

57:57.044 --> 58:00.614
<i>And he's doing okay?</i>
<i>No major mood fluctuations?</i>

58:00.781 --> 58:02.850
No, we're having a great time.

58:03.050 --> 58:04.218
Uh-huh. Well,

58:04.385 --> 58:07.455
if you notice anything
off with him, please call me.

58:07.588 --> 58:09.123
<i>I will. Right away.</i>

58:11.392 --> 58:13.094
All right. Well...

58:14.996 --> 58:17.064
<i>I know this means a lot to him.</i>

58:20.835 --> 58:22.870
I'd do anything for Frankie.

58:31.779 --> 58:34.181
Hey there.
Uh, Chuck. Right?

58:34.415 --> 58:35.750
Yeah! Hey.

58:35.883 --> 58:38.052
- Have you been helped?
- Um...

58:41.255 --> 58:43.791
- Oh, shoot! Shoot! Um...
- Ow.

58:44.225 --> 58:46.861
No worries.
Happens all the time. Seriously.

58:47.294 --> 58:50.097
Ugh, I've been on the road
all day with my son.

58:50.531 --> 58:51.766
I'm taking him to meet a girl.

58:52.033 --> 58:53.334
- Your son?
- Uh-huh.

58:53.467 --> 58:55.403
That's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

58:55.536 --> 58:56.704
We eating today?

58:56.837 --> 58:58.939
Relationships
can be so tricky though.

58:59.940 --> 59:01.308
- Tell me about it.
- Right?

59:01.442 --> 59:03.077
- Yeah.
- You in one?

59:04.078 --> 59:05.646
- What?
- Like, you know,

59:05.780 --> 59:08.349
- do you have a boyfriend or...?
- Why do you ask?

59:08.682 --> 59:11.152
Just making conversation,
I guess.

59:12.286 --> 59:13.721
I'll come back
when you're ready.

59:14.255 --> 59:15.856
Okay? Yeah.

59:25.299 --> 59:28.169
<i>Derek,</i>
<i>you are the most thoughtful,</i>

59:28.302 --> 59:31.238
<i>unique, and kind person</i>
<i>I've ever met.</i>

59:31.506 --> 59:33.207
<i>And... I love you.</i>

1:00:15.216 --> 1:00:16.617
So...

1:00:17.852 --> 1:00:19.186
what's the plan?

1:00:23.190 --> 1:00:24.125
Becca?

1:00:25.092 --> 1:00:26.026
Sorry.

1:00:26.427 --> 1:00:28.162
- Hey, for a second I thought...
- I'm freaking out.

1:00:34.768 --> 1:00:36.270
Is there someone else?

1:00:37.471 --> 1:00:38.405
No.

1:00:39.306 --> 1:00:40.307
What is it then?

1:00:42.042 --> 1:00:44.411
You're a great guy. I'm just...

1:00:45.880 --> 1:00:48.082
going through a lot of
my own stuff right now.

1:00:48.583 --> 1:00:49.483
Like what?

1:00:53.053 --> 1:00:54.922
I'm movin' to California.

1:01:02.429 --> 1:01:03.864
What? Why? Since when?

1:01:04.331 --> 1:01:06.867
I've been wanting to
for a while.

1:01:08.836 --> 1:01:10.572
How come
you've never said anything?

1:01:10.838 --> 1:01:12.473
It just came up.
There's a job there.

1:01:12.607 --> 1:01:13.841
Maybe even Japan.

1:01:14.576 --> 1:01:15.577
What are you talking...?

1:01:15.709 --> 1:01:16.710
Can you
get on a call right now?

1:01:17.144 --> 1:01:19.380
You're gonna meet
someone so incredible.

1:01:19.514 --> 1:01:20.582
I know it.

1:01:20.814 --> 1:01:22.416
Wait, are you
breaking up with me?

1:01:26.020 --> 1:01:29.123
I'm sorry.

1:02:22.409 --> 1:02:23.444
She ended it.

1:02:24.679 --> 1:02:26.880
- What?
- We were talking...

1:02:27.582 --> 1:02:29.116
she stopped responding...

1:02:30.017 --> 1:02:32.886
then she freaked out
and said she was done.

1:02:33.588 --> 1:02:35.990
- Franklin...
- I don't know what happened.

1:02:39.293 --> 1:02:43.797
I mean, if you think about it,
maybe this is a good thing.

1:02:44.699 --> 1:02:45.866
What?

1:02:46.100 --> 1:02:46.934
That you're
finding this out now.

1:02:47.134 --> 1:02:48.269
I mean, she's showing you

1:02:48.402 --> 1:02:49.970
this whole different
side of herself.

1:02:50.505 --> 1:02:52.507
You don't wanna be
with someone like this.

1:02:57.378 --> 1:02:59.980
I mean,
fuck her. Right?

1:03:00.881 --> 1:03:02.216
Don't talk about her that way.

1:03:02.483 --> 1:03:03.851
- No, I just meant...
- I don't care what you meant.

1:03:03.984 --> 1:03:04.885
- That's my girlfriend.
- Franklin...

1:03:05.019 --> 1:03:05.953
No, no, not fuck her.

1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:07.855
- Come on.
- Fuck you.

1:04:28.502 --> 1:04:33.173
Franklin! Franklin!

1:04:40.414 --> 1:04:42.883
What are you doing?

1:04:48.255 --> 1:04:52.459
I don't know.

1:06:17.277 --> 1:06:18.479
Franklin.

1:06:20.815 --> 1:06:24.351
I'm worried you won't like
the person I am in real life.

1:06:24.485 --> 1:06:25.385
But...

1:06:25.687 --> 1:06:31.158
you are the most thoughtful,
unique...

1:06:32.927 --> 1:06:36.531
and kind person I've ever met.

1:06:43.237 --> 1:06:44.739
And I love you.

1:06:50.879 --> 1:06:52.647
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Here we go y'all</i>

1:06:53.113 --> 1:06:54.549
<i>A little 98 Degrees.</i>

1:06:54.849 --> 1:06:57.217
Never sang this song
before in my life.

1:06:57.652 --> 1:06:59.888
I can pick any song,
because that's how great I am.

1:07:11.966 --> 1:07:13.200
Whoo! Yeah!

1:07:13.333 --> 1:07:14.702
Yeah.

1:07:14.836 --> 1:07:16.905
Jimmy!

1:07:25.813 --> 1:07:27.314
I mean, she's
just special, you know?

1:07:27.447 --> 1:07:29.416
Like, look.
Like, look what she said.

1:07:30.050 --> 1:07:32.052
Isn't that, like, poetic?

1:07:32.587 --> 1:07:34.589
Looks like
she's saying goodbye to me.

1:07:37.124 --> 1:07:39.561
- Wait, what?
- What... what is it?

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:42.229
That tech company
Becca sent my stuff to.

1:07:42.462 --> 1:07:44.464
They want to meet me
for an interview.

1:07:44.632 --> 1:07:48.235
Wow!

1:07:48.368 --> 1:07:52.006
- Right? That's awesome! Oh.
- Great news, man.

1:07:52.139 --> 1:07:53.440
Yeah, that's... that's...

1:07:53.775 --> 1:07:55.677
How's it feel spendin'
all this time with your pops?

1:07:55.810 --> 1:07:57.411
Oh, I gotta
tell Becca about this.

1:07:57.612 --> 1:07:59.079
Can I give you some advice?

1:07:59.379 --> 1:08:01.481
Just... just real quick
while you focus on that girl.

1:08:01.616 --> 1:08:03.051
- You know, you gotta...
- Yeah.

1:08:03.350 --> 1:08:04.652
You can't really just
invest everything into her

1:08:04.786 --> 1:08:06.186
like that, you know?
You know, she could be

1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:08.455
like mean or... or a scammer,

1:08:08.590 --> 1:08:10.290
or just a liar.
I mean, or your dad.

1:08:14.862 --> 1:08:18.265
Your dad.

1:08:18.398 --> 1:08:20.167
Oh. You know, look,

1:08:20.334 --> 1:08:22.670
I always say it's best
not to, you know,

1:08:22.870 --> 1:08:25.807
think too far ahead,
and, uh, you know,

1:08:26.074 --> 1:08:28.342
don't look at horses. You know?

1:08:28.643 --> 1:08:30.277
You know what I'm saying, Jimmy?

1:08:30.410 --> 1:08:32.312
I... I hear what
you're sayin', you know...

1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:35.248
What I'm saying is keep
your expectations low.

1:08:35.382 --> 1:08:39.854
Like really, really low.
Don't put 'em too high,

1:08:39.988 --> 1:08:41.723
'cause you'd get really
disappointed. So, keep 'em low.

1:08:41.856 --> 1:08:43.323
This girl
is the love of my life.

1:08:43.457 --> 1:08:44.826
Right, see,
you're still talkin' like...

1:08:44.959 --> 1:08:46.594
the expectation's too high.
Keep it low. Okay?

1:08:46.761 --> 1:08:49.463
- People can be really tricky.
- Not Becca.

1:08:49.831 --> 1:08:52.066
You really, really sold
on Becca, ain't you?

1:08:52.199 --> 1:08:54.002
She's amazing.

1:08:54.368 --> 1:08:55.502
Well, you know something,

1:08:55.637 --> 1:08:56.771
I'mma go get
something' stronger,

1:08:57.137 --> 1:08:58.640
because it's too much love
in the building for me.

1:08:58.773 --> 1:09:00.942
I'm jealous.
You got all the love.

1:09:01.075 --> 1:09:03.011
Take your time gettin'
back. I gotta finish this one.

1:09:03.143 --> 1:09:05.913
Grab one at the bar and,
you know, see you back here.

1:09:06.047 --> 1:09:08.816
- I gotta get out of town more.
- Oh, you come anytime you want.

1:09:08.950 --> 1:09:10.785
- Really?
- And I'm gonna visit more.

1:09:10.918 --> 1:09:12.520
- Okay.
- Great.

1:09:13.921 --> 1:09:16.289
Can we not tell anybody
about the whole, uh...

1:09:17.091 --> 1:09:19.694
- pool thing?
- Between us.

1:09:20.394 --> 1:09:23.397
Next up, Chuck Green.
"Boys Don't Cry."

1:09:23.531 --> 1:09:25.533
Come on.

1:09:25.667 --> 1:09:28.736
- No.
- Come on, come on.

1:09:28.870 --> 1:09:30.505
- No, no.
- Come on.

1:09:30.672 --> 1:09:32.640
I'm not... I'm not doing that.

1:09:34.207 --> 1:09:35.710
It's my favorite song.

1:09:36.276 --> 1:09:38.278
Someone else's favorite song.

1:10:12.980 --> 1:10:14.615
We should've done this
forever ago.

1:10:14.749 --> 1:10:16.684
You're like the karaoke
king up there, man.

1:10:16.818 --> 1:10:20.722
- I mean, great night, right?
- I think you need to stop.

1:10:23.024 --> 1:10:27.762
This... this is the most...
I... I've talked to him in...

1:10:57.024 --> 1:10:58.358
Ugh.

1:13:18.199 --> 1:13:19.800
Hey, I shot you.

1:13:22.236 --> 1:13:23.704
I shot you. Leave.

1:13:25.106 --> 1:13:26.107
You cheater.

1:13:27.375 --> 1:13:32.947
Cheater, cheater, cheater,
cheater, cheater, cheater!

1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:38.185
Cheater, cheater, cheater...

1:13:38.352 --> 1:13:39.587
No! I can't get out.

1:13:39.987 --> 1:13:44.825
Cheater, cheater, cheater...

1:13:44.959 --> 1:13:48.095
Dad!

1:13:48.229 --> 1:13:50.231
- No! Get away!
- Dad!

1:13:50.364 --> 1:13:52.767
- Dad, what's going on?
- I need to find the way out!

1:13:52.900 --> 1:13:54.101
I can't get out!
I can't get out.

1:13:54.235 --> 1:13:55.369
Okay, hold on! Hold on!

1:13:55.636 --> 1:13:56.938
- Let's get help.
- Okay, okay.

1:13:57.071 --> 1:13:58.372
Come on, come on. Let's go.

1:13:58.506 --> 1:14:00.174
Hey, can we have
some help, please?

1:14:00.341 --> 1:14:01.441
Okay, you're okay.

1:14:01.575 --> 1:14:03.644
All right,
just come over here.

1:14:04.145 --> 1:14:05.646
Hey, you're okay.
Is it your heart?

1:14:05.780 --> 1:14:07.281
- What, are you okay?
- No, no. I just...

1:14:07.415 --> 1:14:08.582
- I can't get my breath.
- Okay.

1:14:08.716 --> 1:14:10.017
You're having a panic attack.

1:14:10.351 --> 1:14:11.919
- You're having a panic attack.
- I know, I know, I know.

1:14:12.119 --> 1:14:13.988
- You okay?
- I'm a bad dad, okay?

1:14:14.155 --> 1:14:15.389
Bad dad.
I'm a bad dad.

1:14:15.523 --> 1:14:16.724
I want to be a good dad.

1:14:16.857 --> 1:14:19.694
Oh, come on, Dad, no.

1:14:19.860 --> 1:14:21.195

1:14:21.329 --> 1:14:23.130

There are almost times...

1:14:23.264 --> 1:14:25.066

1:14:25.199 --> 1:14:26.534
don't do this. Come on.

1:14:27.201 --> 1:14:30.037
Dad, you're gonna be okay.
Just take some deep breaths.

1:14:30.604 --> 1:14:32.540
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

1:14:32.673 --> 1:14:34.175

1:14:34.474 --> 1:14:35.643
You're okay.

1:14:35.876 --> 1:14:38.145
Deep breaths. You're having
a panic attack.

1:15:17.685 --> 1:15:18.886

<i>bring him home! Right now!</i>

I... I, you know,
I didn't know what to do.

1:18:14.428 --> 1:18:16.330
And I thought
I wanted to give you space

1:18:16.463 --> 1:18:18.600
and then space
turned into years and...

1:18:18.832 --> 1:18:19.800
you know, you hated me.

1:18:19.967 --> 1:18:23.037
Dad, it's okay. It's okay.

1:18:23.204 --> 1:18:24.772
It just kept going and going.

1:18:25.005 --> 1:18:27.208
And... and...I thought it was...

1:18:27.374 --> 1:18:29.910
I thought it was helping.
And... and it was.

1:18:30.311 --> 1:18:32.246
- I'll... I'll be right back.

1:18:32.614 --> 1:18:34.114

1:18:34.248 --> 1:18:35.716
- We will. We will.
- Let's just sit down.

1:18:35.849 --> 1:18:37.318
I'm gonna get you some water.

1:18:37.451 --> 1:18:39.787
We're gonna talk in a bit,
okay? I'll be right back.

1:18:41.556 --> 1:18:42.990
It's not her. It's not her.

1:18:46.794 --> 1:18:48.295
You want
strawberries or blueberries

1:18:48.929 --> 1:18:50.164
Welcome to Carl's.

1:18:52.967 --> 1:18:59.840
So...

1:19:04.345 --> 1:19:05.446
Hi.

1:19:05.913 --> 1:19:07.448
Do you want to take a seat?

1:19:07.649 --> 1:19:08.916
Oh, I would love to.

1:19:09.250 --> 1:19:11.418
Great. I'll...
I'll grab a menu for you.

1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:12.687
Uh...

1:19:13.087 --> 1:19:15.256
- What's, uh, what's your name?
- Becca.

1:19:15.422 --> 1:19:16.658
I'm Franklin.

1:19:16.790 --> 1:19:18.526
- Nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to meet you.

1:19:18.660 --> 1:19:21.563
I will grab a menu for you.
Do you wanna go over there?

1:19:21.795 --> 1:19:23.063
I'll be over there.

1:19:23.197 --> 1:19:24.331
- Okay.
- And I'll see you soon.

1:19:24.465 --> 1:19:25.533
Okay.

1:19:26.601 --> 1:19:27.835
All right.

1:19:28.269 --> 1:19:32.873
Do you guys want any, um...
would you guys like some...

1:19:33.173 --> 1:19:37.044
some cream, sugar
for your coffee? Um...

1:19:37.945 --> 1:19:39.313
Great. I'll get that.

1:19:39.446 --> 1:19:42.182
And do you want me
to get some more... more water?

1:20:04.938 --> 1:20:07.107
Hey, excuse me.
I was wondering.

1:20:07.241 --> 1:20:08.909
- Could you help me?
- What can I help you with?

1:20:09.076 --> 1:20:11.979
I was wondering
what you, uh, would call

1:20:12.112 --> 1:20:13.748
the job that you have?

1:20:14.248 --> 1:20:15.816
- Busboy.
- Uh, busboy.

1:20:15.949 --> 1:20:18.118
You know, that's... that's weird
because, what if... what if...

1:20:18.252 --> 1:20:19.953
what if you were if you were
like a girl or something?

1:20:20.254 --> 1:20:23.924
Um... I assume you're a busgirl.

1:20:24.325 --> 1:20:27.428
That's... that's funny.

1:20:27.629 --> 1:20:30.532
You are funny.
All right, that was quick.

1:20:30.898 --> 1:20:32.634
All right. Here you go.

1:20:32.767 --> 1:20:33.901
Thank you very much.

1:20:34.435 --> 1:20:35.836
I'll get you started with water.
Do you wanna hear the specials?

1:20:36.003 --> 1:20:37.639
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm just here...

1:20:37.806 --> 1:20:40.107
I'm just here eating some food.

1:20:40.474 --> 1:20:41.609
Um...

1:20:41.743 --> 1:20:44.178
Yeah, we've got...
we've got Belgian waffles.

1:20:44.311 --> 1:20:46.614
Uh, those are topped with
strawberries, blueberries

1:20:46.748 --> 1:20:47.915
and whipped cream.

1:20:48.215 --> 1:20:49.950
The whipped cream
is also house made. So...

1:20:53.788 --> 1:20:56.023
Look, I'm thinking like,
you know, I really wanna,

1:20:56.156 --> 1:20:59.761
you know, do something.
We should make a documentary

1:21:00.060 --> 1:21:02.797
about the lives of...
of bus people.

1:21:02.996 --> 1:21:04.398
What are you talking about, man?

1:21:04.632 --> 1:21:06.033
Would you like
syrup on the side with that?

1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:09.470
I would like syrup...
everywhere.

1:21:09.604 --> 1:21:12.574
On the waffle everywhere?

1:21:12.774 --> 1:21:15.142
Everywhere on the waffle,
in all the little pockets.

1:21:15.376 --> 1:21:18.646
Great.
Okay, then heavy on the syrup.

1:21:18.780 --> 1:21:20.849
Put the syrup on the waffles.
Put the syrup on the side.

1:21:20.981 --> 1:21:24.084
Put the syrup on my face,
put the syrup on my heart.

1:21:24.218 --> 1:21:25.720
- I'm sorry?
- Put the syrup everywhere.

1:21:25.854 --> 1:21:28.021
Put the syrup all over.

1:21:28.355 --> 1:21:31.058
I'm sorry, I'll stay...
I'll try to stay in it with you.

1:21:31.191 --> 1:21:33.160
Let's keep... Sorry. I'll stay.

1:21:37.398 --> 1:21:39.466
I'm sorry, you're really
committed to this.

1:21:39.768 --> 1:21:41.034
I'm sorry?

1:21:42.302 --> 1:21:44.071
I said, you're really committed
to this.

1:21:44.938 --> 1:21:47.609
- It is my job.
- Yeah.

1:21:48.275 --> 1:21:49.677
Anyone watching
would be like, oh my God...

1:21:49.811 --> 1:21:51.546
- I gotta get back to work.
- Totally, totally.

1:21:51.679 --> 1:21:53.213
- But... but one more.
- You're actually not even

1:21:53.347 --> 1:21:54.582
- allowed to be back here.
- One more thing.

1:21:54.716 --> 1:21:56.350
Dude, the Health Department
would bug.

1:21:56.483 --> 1:21:57.951
You need to get out. Come on.

1:21:58.218 --> 1:21:59.721
Okay, listen, one more thing.
Fuck. What was it?

1:21:59.888 --> 1:22:01.488
You were right about my dad.

1:22:02.557 --> 1:22:03.758
He is a good guy.

1:22:04.391 --> 1:22:08.128
The story you told me
helped a lot.

1:22:10.665 --> 1:22:12.132
The one about your dad.

1:22:12.634 --> 1:22:13.400
Uh...

1:22:13.835 --> 1:22:16.303
The one about your dad,
how he passed away?

1:22:17.070 --> 1:22:18.305
I mean, yeah,
my dad's fucked up,

1:22:18.472 --> 1:22:19.874
but, I mean, he drove me
all the way out here

1:22:20.007 --> 1:22:21.776
to meet you, and...

1:22:22.109 --> 1:22:25.012
I mean... he's my dad, you know?

1:22:25.145 --> 1:22:27.948
I mean, sure, he hasn't
always been there but...

1:22:28.883 --> 1:22:30.350
I love my dad.

1:22:33.555 --> 1:22:34.955
And I love you.

1:22:36.691 --> 1:22:40.060
Uh, you... sorry, you're making
me extremely uncomfortable.

1:22:40.795 --> 1:22:42.831
I can't do the game anymore,
Becca. I'm here.

1:22:42.963 --> 1:22:45.499
I can't have you back here,
just like health code stuff.
Yeah, yeah.

1:22:45.667 --> 1:22:46.701
No, my dad isn't dead,

1:22:46.967 --> 1:22:48.903
and I have no idea
what you're talking about...

1:22:49.036 --> 1:22:50.772
- Hey, everything...
I feel a connection
to you, man.

1:22:50.971 --> 1:22:53.808
Dude, get the fuck off!

1:22:54.041 --> 1:22:55.209
Dad, what are you doing?

1:22:55.342 --> 1:22:56.544
What the fuck
is going on?

1:22:56.678 --> 1:22:58.045
I'm trying to talk
to my girlfriend.

1:22:58.178 --> 1:22:59.814
I have never
seen this guy before.

1:22:59.980 --> 1:23:01.415
- What is he talking about?
- I don't know

1:23:01.549 --> 1:23:02.983
- what he's talking about.
- What the fuck.

1:23:03.116 --> 1:23:04.351
We've got a fight
over here at the diner.

1:23:04.485 --> 1:23:05.820
That's my girlfriend
you're talking to.

1:23:05.986 --> 1:23:07.321
- What?
- This is my fucking girlfriend!

1:23:07.488 --> 1:23:09.156
- That is not Becca, okay?
- Yes, it is.

1:23:09.323 --> 1:23:10.758
- That's not Becca!
- How could you do this?

1:23:10.892 --> 1:23:12.259
Get them away from me.

1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:14.261
- We could start fresh.
- Frank. Franklin.

1:23:14.394 --> 1:23:15.630
- We could start fresh!
- I'm Becca. I'm Becca.

1:23:15.763 --> 1:23:17.331
- I'm Becca, all right?
- What? What'd you say?

1:23:17.464 --> 1:23:18.867
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't have a choice.

1:23:18.999 --> 1:23:20.234
- I don't know him.
- I gave everything to you.

1:23:20.367 --> 1:23:21.636
He's here sometimes...

1:23:21.803 --> 1:23:23.170
When you blocked me,
I started an account.

1:23:23.303 --> 1:23:24.539
I pretended to be Becca.

1:23:25.405 --> 1:23:27.140
- What is this? What is this?
You're right,
you're right. I'm a liar.

1:23:27.274 --> 1:23:28.743
And if you never wanna
talk to me, I understand.

1:23:28.943 --> 1:23:30.678
I didn't know what to do.
I didn't have another choice.

1:23:30.812 --> 1:23:32.446
- How do you have all this?
- If I can just be honest...

1:23:32.580 --> 1:23:33.982
if I can just be honest, okay?
When you blocked me,

1:23:34.281 --> 1:23:36.350
I started an account
and pretended to be Becca.

1:23:36.483 --> 1:23:38.252
I'm just telling you,
it was just... it was...

1:23:38.418 --> 1:23:40.622
it was just... Franklin,
Franklin, it was just so that

1:23:40.755 --> 1:23:42.289
- I could talk to you, okay?
- No! No, no. No.

1:23:42.422 --> 1:23:43.691
Franklin,
listen to me, please.

1:23:43.825 --> 1:23:50.698
No. No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1:23:54.936 --> 1:23:58.706
No.

1:23:59.707 --> 1:24:02.610
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to talk to you.

1:24:09.951 --> 1:24:13.555
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:24:50.157 --> 1:24:51.191
<i>Hey.</i>

1:24:54.896 --> 1:24:56.096
<i>Franklin...</i>

1:24:57.832 --> 1:25:00.535
<i>I know you'll probably never</i>
<i>want to talk to me again.</i>

1:25:02.169 --> 1:25:03.705
<i>I wouldn't either</i>
<i>if I were you.</i>

1:25:05.974 --> 1:25:10.477
<i>I remember I wasn't</i>
<i>at your ninth birthday party.</i>

1:25:11.713 --> 1:25:14.181
<i>You and your mom</i>
<i>were so mad at me.</i>

1:25:16.183 --> 1:25:17.752
<i>This is lot worse, huh?</i>

1:25:19.252 --> 1:25:23.658
<i>I tried to show up this time,</i>
<i>but I got it wrong.</i>

1:25:24.892 --> 1:25:25.893
<i>Again.</i>

1:25:29.731 --> 1:25:31.966
<i>I've missed out on so much</i>
<i>of your life.</i>

1:25:33.034 --> 1:25:34.902
<i>If we could just go back</i>
<i>to when you were little,</i>

1:25:35.036 --> 1:25:38.039
<i>when we'd take the ferry</i>
<i>to Montauk,</i>

1:25:38.773 --> 1:25:41.141
<i>sing in the car together,</i>
<i>wrestle.</i>

1:25:43.210 --> 1:25:44.579
<i>Maybe it sounds stupid,</i>

1:25:44.712 --> 1:25:46.446
<i>but that road trip</i>
<i>we took together</i>

1:25:46.581 --> 1:25:48.850
<i>was the best time</i>
<i>I've had in my whole life.</i>

1:25:51.786 --> 1:25:53.387
<i>I know you're not</i>
<i>a kid anymore,</i>

1:25:53.521 --> 1:25:55.790
<i>that you're an adult now.</i>

1:25:57.157 --> 1:25:59.594
<i>But you'll always be my son.</i>

1:26:02.964 --> 1:26:05.933
<i>And even if I don't know</i>
<i>how to be the best dad,</i>

1:26:07.401 --> 1:26:10.437
<i>I love you</i>
<i>more than you will ever know.</i>

1:26:12.907 --> 1:26:14.341
<i>And I'll be here.</i>

1:26:15.777 --> 1:26:16.878
<i>In your corner.</i>

1:26:19.246 --> 1:26:20.347
<i>Forever.</i>

1:26:21.849 --> 1:26:23.483
<i>You're doin' fine.</i>

1:26:23.685 --> 1:26:28.355
<i>You tired?</i>

1:27:00.521 --> 1:27:02.255
Hey, uh, Franklin?

1:27:02.890 --> 1:27:03.925
Hey, sorry.

1:27:04.224 --> 1:27:06.194
I just wanted to say
you're doin' a really great job.

1:27:06.359 --> 1:27:09.697
Oh. Well, thanks for the job.

1:27:09.831 --> 1:27:11.431
Don't thank me.
Thank your friend.

1:27:11.599 --> 1:27:13.768
She was pretty adamant
about giving you a shot.

1:27:13.968 --> 1:27:15.570
I'm glad we listened.

1:29:06.180 --> 1:29:07.480
Chuck.

1:29:07.815 --> 1:29:10.852
I'm writing to let you know
you're a fucking asshole.

1:29:12.385 --> 1:29:14.055
But I also wanted
to let you know

1:29:14.188 --> 1:29:18.425
that there's a vacancy
in the apartment building

1:29:18.559 --> 1:29:23.130
across the street
and it looks affordable.

1:29:28.870 --> 1:29:33.975
Anyway, fuck you.
And I hope you're well.

1:29:52.660 --> 1:29:54.095
Anyway,
I just wanted to call

1:29:54.228 --> 1:29:56.764
and thank you for
sending me that letter.

1:29:56.964 --> 1:29:58.299
<i>It'll be nice</i>
<i>to be across the street</i>

1:29:58.431 --> 1:29:59.967
<i>for you guys from now on.</i>

1:30:00.134 --> 1:30:01.468
Wait, wait, what?

1:30:01.669 --> 1:30:03.971
What do you... what do you...
across the street?

1:30:05.172 --> 1:30:08.475
- Are... are you serious?
<i>- The place you suggested.</i>

1:30:09.243 --> 1:30:11.545
- What are you talking about?
- <i>In the letter.</i>

1:30:11.679 --> 1:30:12.847
What letter?

1:30:13.047 --> 1:30:15.983
<i>The one you sent</i>
<i>a few months ago.</i>

1:30:16.317 --> 1:30:17.752
What... you...

1:30:19.787 --> 1:30:23.724
You can't just
move in across the street!

1:30:23.858 --> 1:30:26.560
<i>- Diane, you told me to.</i>
- What are you talking about?

1:30:26.694 --> 1:30:28.329
<i>In the letter!</i>
<i>You said in the letter!</i>

1:30:28.495 --> 1:30:29.864
I didn't send you a letter!

1:30:30.798 --> 1:30:32.867
<i>What are you</i>
<i>doing across the street?</i>

1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:36.436
<i>Oh, my God. Take those boxes</i>
<i>and put them back in the truck.</i>
