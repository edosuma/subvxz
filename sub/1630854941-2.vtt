WEBVTT

00:15.647 --> 00:19.276
Good morning.
After an extensive manhunt,

00:19.276 --> 00:25.948
two men, Rafael and Mateo Gallardo,
ages 18 and 20, respectively,

00:26.366 --> 00:29.285
were arrested for the murder
of Brooks McCutcheon.

00:29.618 --> 00:31.079
Suspects were found

00:31.495 --> 00:35.457
living in a vagrant camp
in the Vernon area of Los Angeles.

00:35.791 --> 00:40.046
The Gallardos are of Mexican
extraction, unemployed,

00:40.755 --> 00:42.090
and were apprehended together.

00:42.090 --> 00:45.175
While the death of any citizen
is shocking,

00:45.594 --> 00:49.139
the loss of a leading light
of this city is truly a tragedy.

00:49.514 --> 00:53.517
I want the words to ring out
to all who can hear me now

00:55.519 --> 00:56.896
that justice will be done.

00:57.980 --> 01:00.691
The police have performed
their job with honor.

01:00.691 --> 01:04.362
And my office will try this case
with the utmost integrity

01:04.362 --> 01:08.616
to ensure the people of Los Angeles
receive the verdict they deserve.

01:08.616 --> 01:10.034
To that end,

01:10.785 --> 01:14.705
I am assigning my top deputy
to the case, Mr. Thomas Milligan.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.460
Thank you,
District Attorney Burger.

01:19.460 --> 01:23.840
Gentlemen, savages,
such as these men,

01:23.840 --> 01:26.426
have no place
in our civilized society,

01:26.426 --> 01:29.303
and the evidence already gathered
against these two is overwhelming.

01:29.303 --> 01:31.764
Now, I've been tasked
with sending a message

01:31.764 --> 01:34.225
to all who wish to do us harm,

01:34.225 --> 01:39.314
and that message
is we will not allow you to terrorize

01:39.813 --> 01:41.942
good, law-loving people.

01:41.942 --> 01:45.527
The ultimate punishment of death is
the only sentence that I will accept,

01:45.527 --> 01:48.865
and I will not rest
until that justice is done.

01:49.949 --> 01:52.034
Mr. Milligan, quick question.
Quick question.

01:52.034 --> 01:53.369
Mr. Milligan, a little more please?

02:22.147 --> 02:25.526
You can actually smell when ants get
at these. They leave behind an odor.

02:25.526 --> 02:26.902
Gotta be able to recognize that.

02:26.902 --> 02:29.572
Look, my best produce supplier
just left me high and dry,

02:29.572 --> 02:30.906
so I'm testing out some new ones,

02:30.906 --> 02:33.535
which means I'm gonna need you
to draw up some contracts

02:33.535 --> 02:35.077
once I decide who passes muster.

02:35.077 --> 02:37.873
Sure. We'd love to take a look
at the old contracts

02:37.873 --> 02:40.749
so we can have an understanding
of your requirements.

02:40.749 --> 02:42.126
We didn't have anything formal.

02:42.126 --> 02:45.838
Of course. Well, if you need us
to vet any new suppliers...

02:45.838 --> 02:48.758
What? So I can find out they're all
crooked? Thanks. I already know.

02:48.758 --> 02:51.802
No, your job is to make sure they
don't screw me on your end. All right?

02:51.802 --> 02:53.679
You catch all the crap
they try in the contracts,

02:53.679 --> 02:56.724
then you do the same thing back
to them but ten times harder.

02:56.724 --> 03:00.561
After what you pulled off with Purtell,
we're going straight for the jugular.

03:00.561 --> 03:03.940
We'll get right on it,
won't we, Mr. Mason?

03:04.941 --> 03:07.109
Yeah, of course. Right on it.

03:11.823 --> 03:14.283
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

03:17.204 --> 03:19.204
Marion got the picture fixed.

03:20.664 --> 03:21.832
Good.

03:23.543 --> 03:26.296
You didn't like it being up anyway,
did you?

03:27.756 --> 03:29.131
Not really.

03:31.258 --> 03:35.639
- You didn't say much in the meeting.
- You were handling it.

03:36.389 --> 03:39.767
Sounds like that contract work will keep
you busy for a while. That's good.

03:39.767 --> 03:44.856
- You mean keep us busy, not just me.
- Yeah.

03:46.525 --> 03:49.902
- Mr. Mason, Miss Street, this is--
- My name is Luisa Gallardo.

03:49.902 --> 03:52.030
We came to see you

03:52.030 --> 03:54.907
because my nephews,
Rafael and Mateo, were arrested.

03:56.116 --> 03:58.745
Gallardo?
The Brooks McCutcheon thing?

03:59.078 --> 04:04.209
They didn't do anything wrong.
This is Sofia. Mateo's wife.

04:04.209 --> 04:06.002
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

04:06.002 --> 04:07.504
- Please...
- Yeah.

04:09.838 --> 04:11.216
Sit down.

04:12.467 --> 04:15.720
We don't know what is happening
to our boys! No one will talk to us.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.472
Hold on. Who's their lawyer?

04:18.472 --> 04:20.058
They should've been assigned
a public defender.

04:20.058 --> 04:22.017
Yes, his name is Frank Dillon.

04:22.017 --> 04:28.066
We called and even went to his office,
but he said he was too busy to see us.

04:28.691 --> 04:31.194
Public defenders have a lot of cases
at any given time.

04:31.194 --> 04:37.450
They aren't killers! Rafael is an artist.
And Mateo, he wants to be a mechanic.

04:37.450 --> 04:40.536
l understand all that.
We can't take this case.

04:40.536 --> 04:43.289
Emily Dodson. You save her.

04:48.168 --> 04:51.506
- No, no, I didn't.
- That was very different circumstances.

04:51.506 --> 04:55.552
But you believed she was innocent
when no one else did.

04:57.887 --> 05:01.056
Mrs. Gallardo, we understand
how hard this must be for you,

05:01.056 --> 05:04.102
but we can't just step onto this case.

05:04.102 --> 05:07.439
This firm now specializes in civil law,
not criminal.

05:07.771 --> 05:10.483
We would be happy to put in a call
to Mr. Dillon for you.

05:10.483 --> 05:12.360
Why don't you call here
at the end of the day?

05:12.360 --> 05:14.196
And we'll let you
know what we found out.

05:22.412 --> 05:25.247
I don't care what reason you have
for ignoring us.

05:25.706 --> 05:27.333
We need help.

05:29.209 --> 05:31.045
We need you.

05:33.464 --> 05:38.469
l'm sorry. I can't.
l'm not the right man for this. I'm not.

05:41.138 --> 05:42.389
Let's go!

05:44.725 --> 05:45.893
Come, Maria.

05:58.114 --> 06:00.200
- Well, that was...
- Yeah.

06:26.476 --> 06:27.769
Sit.

06:36.570 --> 06:39.738
The Birch is where Perkins
does most of his business.

06:40.322 --> 06:44.327
The days I sat on it, there was a
whole host of comings and goings.

06:45.536 --> 06:48.080
I catalogued each person
that Perkins came in contact with.

06:48.582 --> 06:51.792
And one thing's for certain:
ain't no one watching him but me,

06:52.419 --> 06:56.381
and ain't no real threats to him
that I can see wanting him gone.

07:00.009 --> 07:01.219
Who's this about?

07:01.595 --> 07:05.432
Down on Central, Perkins
got his hands in everybody's pie.

07:05.432 --> 07:08.643
- Shakedowns?
- No, no, it's just some loan sharking.

07:09.477 --> 07:12.646
Come on. There's a Perkins
in every neighborhood.

07:13.273 --> 07:16.692
Truth is Perkins sees better
than most of them.

07:17.276 --> 07:21.113
He puts a lot of that money back in,
and he's helping folks out.

07:22.948 --> 07:26.785
Either way, I couldn't suss out
nobody looking to take him out.

07:30.999 --> 07:32.042
Tell you what,

07:32.458 --> 07:35.045
take this to room 206
down at Justice.

07:35.045 --> 07:37.505
Give me your hours.
I'll get you paid.

07:38.130 --> 07:39.341
Good work.

07:46.722 --> 07:48.850
I heard the press conference
this morning.

07:48.850 --> 07:51.101
- How'd I sound?
- Exactly like a D.A.

07:51.895 --> 07:53.980
Not sure if that's a compliment or a jab.

07:53.980 --> 07:55.606
I'll let you chew on it.

07:56.649 --> 08:00.904
Did Dillon come to you about a plea yet?
For the Gallardo brothers?

08:00.904 --> 08:03.823
No. We wouldn't offer it if he did.

08:05.824 --> 08:07.035
Thank you.

08:13.875 --> 08:17.128
- What do you think of this place?
- It's magnificent.

08:17.503 --> 08:23.051
Supposedly, Camilla Nygaard burned
through 20 architects to build this thing.

08:23.051 --> 08:24.761
Didn't even name it after herself.

08:24.761 --> 08:26.804
I think she might be insane
for that alone.

08:26.804 --> 08:30.809
Why aren't you open to a plea? These
are practically kids we're talking about.

08:31.183 --> 08:32.519
Over here, Mr. Burger!

08:33.562 --> 08:37.983
Kids who killed Brooks McCutcheon
for a few bucks and a gold coin.

08:38.732 --> 08:39.943
Thank you.

08:40.527 --> 08:41.570
- So...
- Yes.

08:41.570 --> 08:44.613
Give them 25-years-to-life,
they confess in court,

08:44.613 --> 08:46.824
saves you a trial, saves them
from the noose.

08:46.824 --> 08:51.120
With a chance at parole? No. I don't think
so. I've been in this office a month.

08:51.120 --> 08:54.248
I'm gonna throw something this
big back into the pond?

08:54.248 --> 08:57.543
Anyway, I mean, since when
did you become their lawyer?

08:57.543 --> 08:59.379
Sorry, I was just curious.

08:59.878 --> 09:02.965
So, with whom were you supposed
to be here this evening?

09:03.507 --> 09:05.260
One of the Chandler girls,

09:05.635 --> 09:07.845
but she decided to come down
with German measles.

09:07.845 --> 09:10.849
Or maybe she's as uninterested
in a piano concert as you are.

09:10.849 --> 09:14.644
She is uninterested in anything
but herself.

09:16.354 --> 09:17.605
Thank you.

09:19.815 --> 09:21.108
How about this?

09:21.108 --> 09:24.653
The brothers get life. No parole.
No death penalty,

09:24.653 --> 09:27.740
but incarceration somewhere close
enough their family can visit.

09:32.953 --> 09:36.999
We all sadly realize
that we are a guest short this evening

09:38.126 --> 09:41.671
with the tragedy
and loss of Brooks McCutcheon.

09:43.505 --> 09:45.090
But those of us who knew Brooks

09:45.090 --> 09:48.053
also know that he would want
this night to go on.

09:48.053 --> 09:51.014
And so, we dedicate this evening to him.

09:56.102 --> 09:57.728
Now, as many of you know,

09:57.728 --> 10:02.651
I came here from Minnesota
35 years ago, a penniless girl,

10:02.651 --> 10:05.194
to ply my trade as a piano teacher.

10:05.569 --> 10:11.158
I soon found some eager students,
and one stood out far above the rest,

10:11.993 --> 10:15.704
and I still ask her to play for us
on these intimate occasions

10:15.704 --> 10:20.752
when we gather to raise money
for the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

10:21.920 --> 10:28.176
Playing Schubert's Sonata Number 21
in B Flat Major is Constance Barbour.

11:04.587 --> 11:07.174
So you can squeeze it when I fall asleep.

11:10.843 --> 11:13.095
I tell you I took Ruthie and the kids
to the pier last week?

11:13.680 --> 11:17.224
Watch that horse that dives into a pool
of water from like forty feet up.

11:17.224 --> 11:18.643
I'm sure you're gonna.

11:19.727 --> 11:21.562
I'm figuring it's got to be
a retarded horse.

11:21.562 --> 11:24.900
How the hell else do you get it up there?
Normal horse ain't goin'.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.483
Maybe they get it drunk.

11:27.151 --> 11:29.279
Whatever it is, they must have a stable
full of 'em ready to go

11:29.279 --> 11:31.989
because no way
that thing doesn't break its neck,

11:31.989 --> 11:33.992
they drag it out and bring in another.

11:33.992 --> 11:35.535
But then get this:

11:36.035 --> 11:39.663
the whinnying fucker
leaps into the tiny pool.

11:40.373 --> 11:42.459
Dives better than
Johnny fuckin' Weissmuller.

11:42.459 --> 11:45.962
Knocked me on my can.
Ruthie, she loses her wits.

11:46.295 --> 11:49.298
She's boohoo'ing for the horse,
this and that.

11:49.883 --> 11:52.843
Me, I stayed and watched it
four more times.

11:54.386 --> 11:57.014
No one can ever say
you're not a man of the world.

11:57.014 --> 11:59.559
I know what I like,
and I like what I know.

12:01.770 --> 12:04.481
You get that Dodson thing
I left for you?

12:07.149 --> 12:10.362
What? Did you expect
to find something good in there?

12:13.781 --> 12:15.283
Anyone else know?

12:15.616 --> 12:18.619
Nah. Her name don't mean nothin'
where she did it.

12:18.994 --> 12:21.456
And the holy roller,
she just gave him a new Emily Dodson

12:21.456 --> 12:25.210
to go along with a new baby
and just kept right on rollin'.

12:27.628 --> 12:31.758
The Gallardo brothers' aunt came to see
me today. Asked me to take the case.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.344
You do get the doozies.

12:34.344 --> 12:36.095
Brother, what comes knocking
at your door.

12:36.429 --> 12:40.058
- If I didn't have bad luck, boy-o...
- I'd have no luck at all.

12:40.808 --> 12:43.854
- You still can't do 'em.
- You gonna take it?

12:45.104 --> 12:47.856
I'm out of that business.
I need to tell you why?

12:47.856 --> 12:49.818
Milligan wants this one bad.

12:49.818 --> 12:52.027
He's looking to get up
to Sacramento or D.C.

12:52.027 --> 12:55.406
Gonna make all the hay he can
with those two killer spies.

12:55.406 --> 12:56.658
Gonna hang 'em up like piñatas

12:56.992 --> 12:59.827
and whack the shit out of them for
the whole world to see. I'm tellin' ya.

12:59.827 --> 13:03.080
That sounds about
how our forefathers dreamed it up.

13:04.833 --> 13:07.961
You know Milligan don't eat meat?
Just fruits and veg.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.504
He must shit pellets.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.632
How's he lookin' to play it in court?

13:13.007 --> 13:17.512
Simple. Desperate Pedros walk up
on a rich fella. Stick him up.

13:18.345 --> 13:21.391
Rich fella bravely fights off the one
reaching for his gold coin.

13:21.391 --> 13:26.145
The other one panics, fires. McCutcheon
ends up with a slug in his head.

13:26.479 --> 13:29.565
Of all the guys in this city, those two
stumble across and shoot point blank,

13:29.565 --> 13:31.609
it's Brooks-fucking-McCutcheon?

13:31.609 --> 13:33.068
Wasn't point blank.

13:33.904 --> 13:36.656
- What do you mean?
- No powder burns on McCutcheon.

13:36.656 --> 13:38.908
What? They got him at range?

13:39.868 --> 13:42.495
- How many shots?
- One, as far as we can tell.

13:42.495 --> 13:44.413
You didn't hear that from me.

13:47.584 --> 13:52.630
Clickety-clack. I know that look.
You can't stop your wheels from spinning.

13:53.423 --> 13:56.133
I'm just curious is all.
You gotta get home?

13:56.133 --> 13:58.553
Why would I? You got this place
so comfy-cozy.

13:59.136 --> 14:02.514
Besides, Ruthie don't mind me passing
time with you these days.

14:02.514 --> 14:03.642
Since when?

14:03.642 --> 14:06.853
Since I got with the D.A.s.
Maybe a little before.

14:06.853 --> 14:10.524
She figures you got me turned out right.
Got me work.

14:10.524 --> 14:13.777
And no way Burger hires me
if I'm not in good with you.

14:14.861 --> 14:16.112
Thank you.

14:18.572 --> 14:22.576
One of those boys gets McCutcheon
with a single shot at distance?

14:23.118 --> 14:24.286
That make sense to you?

14:25.329 --> 14:28.290
Bout as much as a horse divin'
into a pool of water.

14:38.342 --> 14:40.011
Why couldn't it have been jazz?

14:40.345 --> 14:42.805
People don't donate to jazz;
they dance to it.

14:43.765 --> 14:46.643
They dance to ballet;
people donate to that.

14:46.643 --> 14:48.979
They also donate to D.A. races,

14:48.979 --> 14:51.064
and you have yet to
take a spin of the room.

14:51.064 --> 14:55.735
After packing the room with this
many deep pockets for me to pick,

14:55.735 --> 14:58.529
our hostess would be
disappointed in me if I didn't.

14:58.529 --> 15:04.327
- Then go. I don't need a babysitter.
- You might be the perfect woman.

15:04.827 --> 15:07.705
Your perfect woman
looks like Clark Gable.

15:25.765 --> 15:28.351
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

15:28.351 --> 15:30.769
- Your dress is beautiful.
- Thank you.

15:32.688 --> 15:34.023
Excuse me.

15:34.023 --> 15:35.983
- How'd you do it?
- What?

15:36.483 --> 15:39.361
Keep Hamilton awake
through the entire piece?

15:39.361 --> 15:41.740
I know how he feels about these things.

15:42.740 --> 15:46.036
- I thought it was a lovely concert.
- Well, thank you.

15:46.660 --> 15:48.454
I try to do these quarterly.

15:48.454 --> 15:52.167
Gather my oil brethren
in the name of something worthwhile.

15:52.167 --> 15:54.044
It's nice to see
they all have a love of the arts.

15:54.377 --> 15:55.628
They're cavemen.

15:56.170 --> 15:58.089
Well, actually, that's an insult
to real cavemen.

15:58.089 --> 16:00.675
Cavemen actually appreciate the art
on their walls.

16:01.593 --> 16:04.637
Now, what about you?
Hamilton tells me you're in law school?

16:04.637 --> 16:05.679
Southwestern.

16:06.139 --> 16:07.974
You going to work for Ham one day?

16:07.974 --> 16:10.267
Actually, I'm already working for a firm.

16:10.267 --> 16:13.646
Oh, good. An independent spirit.
You stay that way.

16:14.898 --> 16:16.566
How did you stay that way?

16:18.567 --> 16:19.902
I never married.

16:20.778 --> 16:24.366
Men only ever wanted
to put something in me

16:24.366 --> 16:27.118
or take something from me,
most often my money.

16:27.118 --> 16:28.869
And while I have no complaints
about the first,

16:28.869 --> 16:31.247
it always seemed to end up with them
going for the second.

16:31.247 --> 16:34.793
It must be difficult being a woman
of so much wealth.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.461
No, actually,
it's pretty damn terrific.

17:56.540 --> 17:57.791
Five feet.

18:38.917 --> 18:40.418
Twenty-four.

18:55.975 --> 18:57.810
Scared kid at night?

18:59.812 --> 19:01.231
Not a chance.

19:01.231 --> 19:03.066
Look, hey, if you're not going to take
more than twenty crates,

19:03.066 --> 19:06.402
then I can't knock the price down any
more. Tere's hardly a profit as it is.

19:06.402 --> 19:08.530
I'd be willing to juice up
a couple gallons for free.

19:08.530 --> 19:10.573
- Is that you, Charlie Goldstein?
- Yeah?

19:10.573 --> 19:12.993
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
- Who are you?

19:12.993 --> 19:15.036
You've been served. Have a great day.

19:23.753 --> 19:24.713
Fuck!

19:29.508 --> 19:30.551
I'm not late.

19:31.677 --> 19:33.220
No, you're not.

19:34.221 --> 19:35.932
You just look like you were out all night.

19:35.932 --> 19:40.728
Just until four. I was working on a case.
Any idea how long this is going to take?

19:40.728 --> 19:42.272
No.

19:43.273 --> 19:45.317
An archery team?

19:46.151 --> 19:48.068
Why does this school
have an archery team?

19:48.068 --> 19:50.030
Are they gonna
be hunting for their lunch on Melrose?

19:50.030 --> 19:54.743
Maybe it's just about discipline
and skill. Maybe it's just about fun.

19:55.535 --> 19:57.871
- Remember fun?
- Are you the Masons?

19:57.871 --> 20:00.539
- Yeah.
- I'm Miss Aimes, Teddy's teacher.

20:00.539 --> 20:01.832
Please.

20:05.086 --> 20:08.590
I wanted Teddy to show you what he's
been working on in the science lab.

20:08.590 --> 20:11.343
- You have a lab?
- We made crystals.

20:11.842 --> 20:15.096
- He's taken to it very quickly.
- This looks like glass.

20:15.096 --> 20:17.682
Glass is more random
under the microscope,

20:17.682 --> 20:20.227
but crystals are more of a pattern but...

20:20.227 --> 20:21.353
Oh, right.

20:21.353 --> 20:24.940
Teddy, do you want to go play
in the yard until first bell?

20:26.233 --> 20:27.691
Please.

20:29.611 --> 20:32.446
Thank you for coming in
so early this morning.

20:33.447 --> 20:35.617
Teddy's already said such great things
about you.

20:35.617 --> 20:36.743
He's a very sweet boy

20:36.743 --> 20:39.912
and getting along quite well considering
he came in mid-swing.

20:39.912 --> 20:42.248
He has quite a mind
for math and science.

20:42.248 --> 20:45.918
- Are you in the sciences, Mr. Mason?
- Me? No.

20:46.545 --> 20:49.880
- He's an attorney.
- We do a whole section on civics.

20:50.257 --> 20:51.591
It's my favorite subject to teach.

20:51.591 --> 20:54.719
I want the children to be proud
of the country they live in.

20:54.719 --> 20:57.721
These days, it's easy for children
to lose faith in those things.

20:58.056 --> 20:59.683
Not if they go to school
in a place like this.

21:00.015 --> 21:01.809
Then I'm very glad they do.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.478
Every child deserves
someone who believes in them.

21:04.478 --> 21:07.314
Aren't all of the parents paying you
to believe in their children?

21:07.314 --> 21:11.443
Aren't all of your clients paying you to
believe in them, Mr. Mason?

21:16.533 --> 21:21.120
Miss Street, Mr. Mason won't be able to
make your eleven o'clock with Mrs. Hunt,

21:21.120 --> 21:24.457
the lady with the spring-making company.
He didn't say why.

21:26.793 --> 21:28.253
I'll do it alone.

21:31.715 --> 21:33.717
Is that the Gallardo girl's doll?

21:34.133 --> 21:35.635
Maria, yes.

21:39.222 --> 21:41.432
Cancel the eleven with Mrs. Hunt.

21:49.649 --> 21:50.608
You our lawyer?

21:51.317 --> 21:53.028
He still hasn't shown up yet?

21:53.444 --> 21:58.033
- Christ.
- No. No, I'm not. I'm sorry.

22:00.034 --> 22:02.536
l am an attorney.
My name is Perry Mason.

22:04.748 --> 22:06.416
Are you even eighteen?

22:08.251 --> 22:15.008
Okay, can you just stick with me
for a second?

22:16.593 --> 22:17.636
- Rafael.
- Rafael.

22:17.636 --> 22:20.722
Rafael, can you hold this?

22:22.681 --> 22:23.892
Thank you.

22:25.059 --> 22:30.357
Now, can you make your hand like
a gun? Like Cowboys and Indians?

22:31.900 --> 22:34.151
- No.
- l'm not trying to jam you up here.

22:34.151 --> 22:35.320
Who the fuck are you?

22:35.320 --> 22:40.200
Your Aunt Luisa came to see me. Like I
said, l'm a lawyer. Your wife Sofia also--

22:40.200 --> 22:41.535
- Sofia?
- Yeah.

22:42.118 --> 22:43.161
Why you?

22:43.161 --> 22:47.623
They read about a case I did
six months ago.

22:47.623 --> 22:52.712
I am trying to help. I swear. But I
need to know what I'm doing here.

22:56.633 --> 22:58.384
- Okay.
- Thank you.

23:00.928 --> 23:02.763
- You right-handed?
- Yes.

23:03.181 --> 23:07.602
Can you straighten your arm? Great.
Thank you. A little higher. Thanks.

23:15.443 --> 23:16.402
Thank you.

23:17.361 --> 23:18.822
Thank you.
Now you.

23:26.371 --> 23:28.206
- You're right-handed?
- Yeah.

23:28.581 --> 23:30.000
Okay.

23:31.585 --> 23:34.421
A little higher. Thank you.
Okay, so...

23:36.548 --> 23:39.885
Maybe six, seven feet.

23:42.804 --> 23:44.471
Okay. Thank you.

23:45.764 --> 23:47.057
Have a seat.

23:52.021 --> 23:56.943
All right. I read the account
in the paper,

23:57.318 --> 24:01.323
but now I want to hear your side
of the story.

24:01.865 --> 24:03.658
Our side is we didn't do it.

24:06.410 --> 24:09.538
So, why was a bus driver
able to pick you out of a line up?

24:09.538 --> 24:13.376
Because we're on that bus every
Saturday night. I could pick him out, too.

24:13.793 --> 24:15.502
Why are you on the bus?

24:15.502 --> 24:18.256
To collect bottles
to make a little money.

24:19.049 --> 24:20.758
Get the two-cent deposit.

24:21.176 --> 24:24.054
What about the gold coin
of Brooks' that you pawned?

24:24.054 --> 24:29.058
In a trash can over on the pier,
I spot this nice billfold.

24:30.310 --> 24:34.521
And it's empty, but then I feel
it's got a little weight on one side,

24:34.521 --> 24:38.150
so I shake it, and this coin slips out.
It was tucked in there, I guess.

24:38.150 --> 24:40.861
- We couldn't believe our luck.
- That ain't no luck.

24:40.861 --> 24:43.697
I told you to leave that thing,
but you had to go and hock it!

24:43.697 --> 24:45.783
It was worth something!
You expect me to just leave it?

24:45.783 --> 24:47.868
Just being too fucking greedy!

24:53.458 --> 24:55.376
I would've hocked it, too.

25:32.121 --> 25:33.331
I'm looking for the Gallardos.

25:33.998 --> 25:36.209
- I believe it's over there.
- Thank you.

25:41.464 --> 25:42.424
Luisa?

25:44.133 --> 25:45.135
Miss Street?

25:45.802 --> 25:46.969
It's the lawyer!

25:48.053 --> 25:49.430
- Come in!
- Thank you.

25:50.180 --> 25:52.558
- Come in.
- Hello, Sofia.

25:53.935 --> 25:56.687
l could offer you some coffee or...

25:57.355 --> 25:59.815
- Are those Rafael's drawings?
- Yes.

26:00.233 --> 26:02.861
- He's talented.
- He wanted to go to art school.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.197
Are you going to defend them?

26:05.197 --> 26:07.699
Have you decided to take the boys' case?

26:09.658 --> 26:11.243
Well, no...

26:14.247 --> 26:16.707
Maria left this at our office.

26:21.504 --> 26:23.673
My daughter needs her father.

26:25.467 --> 26:28.929
l could offer advice to your defense counsel.

26:28.929 --> 26:31.223
Please, don't abandon us.

26:32.015 --> 26:33.350
They're going to kill them!

26:34.934 --> 26:37.521
l am so sorry. I...

26:41.523 --> 26:46.153
- l shouldn't have come.
- But you did come. You want to help us.

26:46.487 --> 26:47.697
Sofia...

26:48.864 --> 26:52.077
I can be anything you need me to be,
Miss Street.

26:52.077 --> 26:55.329
I can be the poor helpless Mexican wife.

26:55.329 --> 26:58.165
Or the brave mother,
left alone to raise her child.

26:58.165 --> 27:00.919
Sofia, you don't need to pretend
to be anything.

27:00.919 --> 27:04.381
You can say that
because you can afford to be yourself.

27:06.257 --> 27:07.591
You want to help us.

27:09.761 --> 27:12.263
Don't forget I was middle-weight champ
at Camp Logan in '17.

27:12.263 --> 27:17.060
Ain't nobody forgot. You forgot. Boxing
and wrasslin' ain't the same thing, Mo.

27:17.060 --> 27:19.770
They both about balance.
Maneuvering, overpowering.

27:19.770 --> 27:22.690
Only thing you overpowering
is this conversation.

27:23.232 --> 27:24.733
- Hey, Paul...
- Yeah.

27:24.733 --> 27:28.238
Tell these ladies how boxing
and wrestling are similar.

27:28.696 --> 27:30.489
Not even close.

27:31.031 --> 27:33.994
- What you talking about?
- Where you been?

27:35.452 --> 27:38.622
Just got us some things
we've been missing out on.

27:38.622 --> 27:41.334
Now, Mo, what you cookin' up?

27:41.709 --> 27:43.294
Now, you know we got
these two Serbian gorillas

27:43.294 --> 27:45.629
that been digging with us
the past few weeks.

27:45.629 --> 27:48.049
Every lunch break, they start wrestling.

27:48.383 --> 27:50.719
Now, say they training
to become professionals.

27:51.135 --> 27:54.097
So, I'm thinking
they may need a trainer.

27:54.097 --> 27:57.267
I can smell the scheme from here.
Jesus!

27:58.893 --> 28:01.438
Know what?
I waste my oxygen on all y'all.

28:04.482 --> 28:08.486
Well, well, things seem
to be looking up for Mr. Drake.

28:08.819 --> 28:13.158
I mean, it's just a one-time gig,
but it might turn into more.

28:14.159 --> 28:15.576
Good for you, Paul.

28:18.454 --> 28:19.873
Hell no.

28:20.873 --> 28:23.167
They got Perkins down at the Birch.

28:23.167 --> 28:24.710
Got him? Who?

28:25.461 --> 28:28.172
- Somebody grease him?
- No, he was arrested.

28:28.715 --> 28:32.593
"By the Los Angeles County District
Attorney on charges of loan sharking,

28:32.928 --> 28:36.097
"racketeering, bootlegging,
and income tax evasion."

28:36.097 --> 28:38.225
Please. Everyone's got a racket.

28:38.225 --> 28:41.727
The mayor's got a racket.
Police got a racket. Mob's got a racket.

28:41.727 --> 28:44.021
You know anything about this?

28:44.021 --> 28:46.525
No, no. This is the first I'm hearing.

28:46.525 --> 28:51.028
I gotta get Lucius's bath ready.
You want to give me a hand, babe?

28:55.532 --> 28:58.286
Girls, go get your cousin ready
for his bath.

29:01.414 --> 29:02.998
Water loud enough?

29:03.959 --> 29:05.167
I think so.

29:06.836 --> 29:10.549
Fucking Strickland.
How'd I let that cracker rook me?

29:10.549 --> 29:12.216
You didn't know.

29:13.635 --> 29:15.344
God damn house nigger.

29:16.053 --> 29:17.680
You didn't get rooked.

29:18.681 --> 29:21.559
You had your mind fixed
on feeding your family,

29:21.559 --> 29:25.105
on working at what you're good at.
You didn't know.

29:27.856 --> 29:29.400
Did you?

29:30.901 --> 29:33.113
Fuck you accusing me of, Clara?

29:33.113 --> 29:36.657
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not the one you're mad at.

29:39.243 --> 29:43.874
Them crackers north of Jefferson ain't
worth a damn. That ain't new news.

29:46.041 --> 29:48.877
We just need to be smarter
than they are evil.

29:52.215 --> 29:53.424
Baby...

29:56.218 --> 29:57.679
I need to get in there.

30:03.809 --> 30:05.687
- Come on, come on.
- Come in, Mo.

30:07.229 --> 30:09.565
Thank you. Thank you for that.
I won't let the water get cold.

30:11.358 --> 30:14.236
When you said you wanted to go out,
I assumed dinner.

30:14.236 --> 30:16.864
We will, but I never ever eat before nine.

30:16.864 --> 30:20.701
Gentlemen... I'll buy you some popcorn
to tide you over.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.589
Hey, low blow! Come on, ref!

30:39.346 --> 30:43.474
Come on, Dub!
Press him! Press him!

30:44.893 --> 30:47.311
- You do this a lot?
- Any chance I get.

30:48.772 --> 30:50.981
Close the distance! Put it...

30:54.736 --> 30:57.948
There's a story going on inside the ring
in every fight.

30:57.948 --> 30:59.699
It's better than any movie.

31:00.992 --> 31:05.871
- I just see punching and blood.
- No. There's so much more underneath.

31:06.580 --> 31:08.165
A fight shows you who you are.

31:08.499 --> 31:12.336
Right now, in that ring, a man is being
exposed for everybody to see.

31:12.336 --> 31:15.005
- Which one?
- Tommy. The taller one.

31:15.590 --> 31:17.175
See, he's longer than the shorter guy,

31:17.175 --> 31:19.426
and he thought he could keep the shorter
fella away with his jab.

31:19.426 --> 31:22.012
But that shorter fella's willing to eat
those jabs for breakfast

31:22.012 --> 31:23.264
to get on the inside,

31:23.264 --> 31:27.644
and now he's using his power to pound
lanky's body like a pile-driver.

31:29.270 --> 31:31.481
Yes! Work the body,
and the head will fall.

31:33.524 --> 31:35.025
There, he did it just then.

31:35.025 --> 31:38.488
Tommy showed up with a plan, but now
all of his weapons are failing him.

31:40.574 --> 31:41.616
He's getting hurt.

31:41.616 --> 31:44.159
He's looked into the eyes
of his opponent,

31:44.159 --> 31:46.787
and he is seeing
something that no boxer wants to see.

31:46.787 --> 31:49.791
- What's that?
- Fearlessness.

31:55.629 --> 31:57.632
So, the taller one's going to lose.

31:57.632 --> 32:02.596
Maybe... or maybe he finds his courage
when everything's stacked against him.

32:05.140 --> 32:07.767
Don't let him close the distance, Tommy!
Move your feet!

32:08.684 --> 32:09.935
Weren't you rooting for the other man?

32:10.604 --> 32:11.897
Not if you aren't.

32:13.273 --> 32:15.775
- C'mon, Tommy!
- That's it, Tommy!

33:06.076 --> 33:09.411
- What's this?
- Before you say anything, hear me out.

33:12.206 --> 33:15.709
I think we should take
the Gallardo case.

33:17.753 --> 33:21.131
- After talking with the brothers...
- You went to see them.

33:21.758 --> 33:24.051
And the Impound Lot
where Brooks' car is being held.

33:24.051 --> 33:26.595
I'm sure they invited you right in. And?

33:28.098 --> 33:29.765
I don't think they did it.

33:30.851 --> 33:32.810
Milligan's case has holes.

33:32.810 --> 33:36.064
And I have evidence that
weakens the case against them.

33:36.064 --> 33:39.276
If you're hoping to use it to secure
a plea deal for them, I already tried.

33:39.276 --> 33:42.654
- Burger shot me down.
- What? You're not their lawyer.

33:44.155 --> 33:45.656
And you are?

33:47.868 --> 33:48.952
You want in on this?

33:50.035 --> 33:52.121
I think it's worth fighting for,

33:53.497 --> 33:56.126
but I don't want to do it if you're not
ready for another murder trial.

33:56.668 --> 34:01.505
It's not just one person this time;
it's two. And a whole family besides.

34:04.467 --> 34:07.761
I don't know. But I know
I can't just do nothing.

34:07.761 --> 34:11.600
And there's no way I can do it
without you.

34:20.483 --> 34:22.860
We'll just take it step by step.

34:23.694 --> 34:25.738
Build our case. Attack theirs.

34:26.238 --> 34:28.450
Work the body,
and the head will fall.

34:28.450 --> 34:31.493
Our only problem is
how do we afford to do this.

34:32.370 --> 34:36.583
We're no good to the Gallardos if we
mount an impoverished defense.

34:36.917 --> 34:39.461
I might have that figured that out.

34:42.671 --> 34:44.548
The first time I heard your jingles
on the radio,

34:44.548 --> 34:45.883
I said to Della, this man is a visionary.

34:46.634 --> 34:48.969
Not a person who settles.
A person who conquers.

34:48.969 --> 34:51.389
And conquering is exactly
what we have in mind.

34:51.765 --> 34:55.352
Block after block, building after
building. Vacant. Vulnerable.

34:55.726 --> 34:58.480
Defenseless. Laying there,
waiting to be conquered.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.648
Expansion, Sunny.
That's the name of the game.

35:00.648 --> 35:04.277
Mr. Mason and I have identified
this cross section of key locations.

35:04.277 --> 35:07.405
Or as you probably remember
what we used to call them in the war.

35:07.405 --> 35:09.073
- Perfect targets.
- Perfect targets.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.785
These empty lots are behind
in their property taxes

35:12.285 --> 35:13.744
and inches from foreclosure.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.914
Now, you can buy these markets
free and clear,

35:15.914 --> 35:18.291
make them into new Sunny's in
almost no time at all.

35:18.291 --> 35:19.918
A Sunny Market in every neighborhood.

35:20.459 --> 35:23.296
In five years,
you could be the king of this city.

35:24.047 --> 35:26.925
Pretty great.
It's what I've always dreamed of.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.426
This is just an idea.

35:28.426 --> 35:32.012
To put it into practice, it would take an
enormous amount of legal advice.

35:32.389 --> 35:34.516
Contract negotiations,
zoning, bankruptcy law,

35:34.516 --> 35:36.726
title transfers,
dealing with creditors.

35:36.726 --> 35:38.395
Hundreds of hours of our time.

35:40.313 --> 35:41.272
How much do you want?

35:41.772 --> 35:43.274
A simple retainer.
A thousand dollars a month.

35:44.191 --> 35:47.279
It's not much to ask to become
the King of Los Angeles.

35:47.279 --> 35:50.365
- You got a set of balls on you, Mason.
- Who else would you want on your side?

35:52.116 --> 35:53.368
Can I see it again?

35:58.998 --> 36:00.166
All rise.

36:03.336 --> 36:04.796
Court will come to order.

36:08.508 --> 36:11.052
Case number 9752,

36:11.427 --> 36:16.474
Arraignment hearing in the matter of the
People vs Mateo and Rafael Gallardo.

36:17.893 --> 36:20.562
Mr. Mason,
how do your clients plead?

36:21.312 --> 36:23.522
- Not guilty, Your Honor.
- Not guilty.

36:24.481 --> 36:26.525
Very well.
Please take your seats.

36:26.942 --> 36:29.321
Now onto the question of bail.
Mr. Milligan?

36:29.321 --> 36:32.616
The defendants are being charged with
the heinous crime of coldblooded murder.

36:32.616 --> 36:34.783
Now, in light of the circumstances
of the crime itself,

36:34.783 --> 36:36.244
we're asking that bail be denied

36:36.244 --> 36:38.872
and that the defendants be held in
custody for the duration of trial.

36:38.872 --> 36:42.000
Your Honor, we believe our clients should
be released on their own recognizance.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.002
- They have strong ties to the community.
- What ties?

36:44.335 --> 36:47.005
They live in a vagrant camp,
and they're a flight risk to Mexico.

36:47.005 --> 36:49.965
- They've never been to Mexico.
- They'd sure blend in if they did.

36:49.965 --> 36:51.801
Maybe go on a nice killing spree
down there, too.

36:51.801 --> 36:54.720
Your Honor, could you please instruct the
D.A. to refrain from smearing our clients?

36:55.055 --> 36:56.556
Don't be so touchy, Mr. Mason.

36:56.556 --> 36:58.766
Then will you at least instruct the D.A.
to be more logical?

36:58.766 --> 37:00.976
Why would my clients try and blend in
and then go on a killing spree?

37:00.976 --> 37:02.229
All right. That's enough, Counselor.

37:02.229 --> 37:06.065
Your Your Honor, as much as we all
sympathize enormously

37:06.065 --> 37:09.360
with McCutcheon family's tragic loss,

37:10.987 --> 37:14.199
having them here is clearly prejudicial.

37:16.785 --> 37:20.580
Do you mind if I decide what is
and isn't prejudicial in my courtroom?

37:20.580 --> 37:23.249
No, Your Honor. That's your job.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.876
Thank you. Bail is denied.

37:36.804 --> 37:38.556
- Hey, there they are.
- Here we go.

37:38.556 --> 37:39.974
Mr. Mason, Ms. Street,
any comments on that?

37:39.974 --> 37:42.101
Are you disappointed that your clients
were denied bail?

37:42.101 --> 37:44.020
We didn't expect they would be given
that consideration

37:44.020 --> 37:46.648
in light of the prejudices
already being shown in this case.

37:46.648 --> 37:49.067
But we will continue to fight for
their fair treatment.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.359
So, you believe they're innocent?

37:50.359 --> 37:52.444
We wouldn't have taken this case
if we didn't.

37:52.444 --> 37:56.032
The evidence against Mateo and
Rafael Gallardo isn't just flimsy;

37:56.032 --> 37:58.701
it's see-through. It's all circumstantial.
And we intend to prove that at trial.

37:59.035 --> 38:00.411
So, you're not concerned about rumors

38:00.411 --> 38:02.871
the forensic report will show Rafael
Gallardo's fingerprint

38:02.871 --> 38:04.791
was on Brooks
McCutcheon's car.

38:06.041 --> 38:10.547
We haven't seen that report, so until
it's released, we'll just have to wait.

38:10.547 --> 38:12.381
- Mr. Milligan! Mr. Milligan, sir!
- Thank you.

38:14.466 --> 38:15.509
Fucking Milligan.

38:15.509 --> 38:17.136
He wouldn't have leaked it
if it wasn't true.

38:17.136 --> 38:18.512
And now it gets reported twice,

38:18.512 --> 38:21.474
once as a rumor and then when it's
confirmed by the report. Fuck!

38:22.017 --> 38:23.225
I let him blindside me.

38:23.225 --> 38:25.562
Can't wait to see our stupid faces
tomorrow in the papers.

38:25.562 --> 38:28.273
Are you going to kick yourself every time
you think you've made a mistake?

38:28.273 --> 38:29.648
We've just started this thing.

38:29.648 --> 38:32.067
No, I just wish Milligan was as dumb
as I wanted him to be.

39:08.980 --> 39:12.274
<i>The crowd has swelled outside
St. Vincent's Cathedral</i>

39:12.858 --> 39:17.405
<i>by this announcer's estimates,
to well over 10 000 grieving souls.</i>

39:18.155 --> 39:20.283
Mourners toss purple tulips,

39:20.909 --> 39:24.870
<i>the same flowers Brooks gave
his loving wife, Elizabeth, every week.</i>

39:25.287 --> 39:28.999
You can bet Milligan will have one of
those flowers on his lapel

39:28.999 --> 39:30.961
every single day in court.

39:30.961 --> 39:34.923
- There's a Mr. Drake to see you.
- Bring him in. Bring him in.

39:42.972 --> 39:46.601
- You got a secretary now?
- You can talk to Della about that one.

39:48.185 --> 39:51.273
Appreciate you coming by, short notice.
Strick said you really helped him out.

39:51.273 --> 39:55.443
- Sounds like he'd use you again.
- And again and again.

39:55.819 --> 39:57.863
You think that might be something
steady to latch onto there?

39:57.863 --> 40:00.448
I wouldn't take that even if there was.

40:01.282 --> 40:02.908
Your pal, he hoodwinked me

40:02.908 --> 40:05.452
into jamming a okay fella
into a pretty big jackpot.

40:05.452 --> 40:06.662
Oh shit.

40:07.580 --> 40:11.333
Drake, l didn't know. l was just
trying to throw some work your way.

40:11.333 --> 40:14.378
- If I had known...
- Perry, I stepped into it.

40:15.046 --> 40:18.383
Then maybe we both have something
against the prosecutor.

40:18.383 --> 40:20.802
You heard we took
the McCutcheon case?

40:22.012 --> 40:25.140
We could use your help
investigating this thing.

40:25.140 --> 40:27.184
Might let you even the score.

40:28.017 --> 40:31.771
We already have some evidence
that might prove their innocence.

40:33.689 --> 40:37.152
- If you believe they did it...
- Perry, I don't know what to believe.

40:37.152 --> 40:40.362
I believed that you would have
more work for me.

40:40.697 --> 40:43.200
Perry, I believed that your friend
would be on the level.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.076
And like I said, I am sorry.
l don't know what...

40:46.076 --> 40:47.454
What do you need?

40:48.662 --> 40:49.956
Trust.

40:51.790 --> 40:54.460
But I don't know
how we're gonna get there.

40:54.460 --> 40:55.921
Do you?

40:57.713 --> 40:59.840
Honestly, no, I don't.

41:05.639 --> 41:07.640
At least I believe that.

41:16.357 --> 41:17.817
Afternoon.

41:20.445 --> 41:21.695
Thank you.

41:22.029 --> 41:25.492
This is everything found on Brooks
and in the car?

41:25.492 --> 41:26.993
Everything we got.

41:38.505 --> 41:41.091
No rips, no signs of a struggle.

41:55.521 --> 41:56.773
Excuse me.

42:02.153 --> 42:04.114
This guy owned the Morocco
gambling ship?

42:04.114 --> 42:06.407
Yeah.
That's what they're reporting.

42:07.032 --> 42:10.661
I read the Luxe was set on fire
a couple days before the murder.

42:10.661 --> 42:12.288
You'd think that's
got anything to do with this?

42:12.288 --> 42:14.583
They're out in international waters
to avoid the cops.

42:14.583 --> 42:17.127
They wanted the wild west,
they got it.

42:18.295 --> 42:20.297
That's a Santa Monica number.

42:40.274 --> 42:42.359
What's with the second belt?

42:45.947 --> 42:47.407
Is that an M?

43:12.139 --> 43:15.809
This thing was a sinking ship both
figuratively and literally.

43:16.268 --> 43:18.979
I found a judgement against the Morocco
for 800 dollars

43:18.979 --> 43:22.943
for an unpaid bill to a company who
reattached its starboard propeller.

43:22.943 --> 43:25.236
- Reattached? What? It fell off?
- Yeah.

43:25.236 --> 43:27.656
Apparently, the Morocco's
a real piece of shit.

43:27.656 --> 43:29.949
Brooks also stiffed another company

43:29.949 --> 43:32.786
that went down to get the
propeller when it fell off.

43:32.786 --> 43:36.915
And that's just the start. There's a trail
of bills, liens, unpaid debts.

43:36.915 --> 43:38.749
And every time a creditor came after him,

43:38.749 --> 43:42.503
he'd liquidate and dump the Morocco's
ownership into a new shell company.

43:42.503 --> 43:45.422
So, the company that owns the Morocco
racks up bills,

43:45.422 --> 43:48.510
can't pay them, and then sells the ship
from that company to another?

43:48.510 --> 43:50.971
Leaving nothing behind
to make good on the debts

43:50.971 --> 43:52.681
and screwing everyone who's owed.

43:52.681 --> 43:54.431
Don't tell Sunny about this.

43:54.431 --> 43:56.517
What kind of rich kid
can't pay his bills?

43:56.517 --> 43:58.812
A broke one.
But who'd want him dead?

43:59.520 --> 44:02.566
We've got to figure out
what's going on out there.

44:03.024 --> 44:04.484
You feeling lucky?

44:12.658 --> 44:14.369
Got room for two more?

44:16.580 --> 44:18.665
Where's the employee taxi?

44:19.708 --> 44:21.041
Meet you there.

44:50.405 --> 44:53.575
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah, I would love a Scotch and soda.

44:53.575 --> 44:54.867
Boy, is this some joint?

44:54.867 --> 44:57.787
I've never been to Morocco,
but if it's anything like this...

44:57.787 --> 45:01.081
- Are you from there?
- Yeah, Morocco by way of Burbank.

45:01.081 --> 45:03.043
But it's swanky.

45:03.043 --> 45:04.668
I heard the owner got hurt or something,

45:04.668 --> 45:07.214
but I guess if you run
a place as nice as this, right?

45:07.214 --> 45:09.257
He wasn't hurt. He was killed.

45:10.884 --> 45:13.887
I'm so sorry to hear that.

45:14.762 --> 45:18.016
- Did you know him?
- No. Excuse me.

45:39.203 --> 45:40.997
The high rollers never come here.

45:41.372 --> 45:44.416
They all go to The Rex
or The Tango down the way.

45:45.459 --> 45:47.586
That because this ship
is in such rotten shape?

45:47.586 --> 45:50.841
We were in dry dock all last week
from an engine problem.

45:50.841 --> 45:54.135
Didn't make a red cent,
and it still don't work right.

45:54.511 --> 45:56.555
But you still got all this produce
coming in.

45:56.887 --> 46:00.432
Only vegetables we ever get.
Mostly carrots and potatoes.

46:44.894 --> 46:48.773
The real problem is the engine.
Should've been replaced years ago.

46:50.190 --> 46:53.611
- We got a lot of problems.
- Just give me four more hours, all right?

46:53.611 --> 46:54.737
Pumps, lights?

46:54.737 --> 46:56.780
We'll do our best, Boss,
but that last fix ain't holdin'.

46:56.780 --> 46:58.866
Just get me through the fucking night.

47:00.576 --> 47:02.703
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Holcomb?

47:02.703 --> 47:07.207
What an honor to have Detective Mason
on board our humble vessel.

47:07.207 --> 47:10.587
I guess McCutcheon picked the wrong
cop as muscle to partner with.

47:10.587 --> 47:12.004
Where are my manners?

47:12.339 --> 47:15.216
You've come all this way, the least I
could do is have my boys give you a tour.

47:15.216 --> 47:17.344
Don't let him get off this ship.

47:36.321 --> 47:37.739
We got to go.

47:53.128 --> 47:57.383
Ladies and gentlemen! If I could have
your attention for just a moment!

47:58.467 --> 48:02.638
My name is Perry Mason. I'm an
attorney. You may know my face.

48:02.638 --> 48:07.685
I just want us all to raise a glass this
evening to an honored guest

48:07.685 --> 48:09.980
that we have with us tonight.

48:10.605 --> 48:15.484
Detective Eugene Holcomb from the
Los Angeles Police Department.

48:15.819 --> 48:18.530
