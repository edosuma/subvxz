01:04.000 --> 01:06.076
They weren't kidding
about you, were they?

01:06.426 --> 01:07.873
Yee-hoo-hoo.

01:11.825 --> 01:13.643
Hey, we coulda used that.

01:19.906 --> 01:21.818
That was really,
really something.

01:23.364 --> 01:26.513
You'll have to pardon me if I got
a little carried away back there.

01:27.914 --> 01:30.185
It's a bit like Christmas in July.

01:32.652 --> 01:34.628
Uh, again?

01:36.480 --> 01:38.965
I guess that's why
they call you a Sex Machine.

01:40.854 --> 01:44.170
Baby, we haven't even got
to the money shot yet.

02:12.701 --> 02:14.764
You said you were going
to lead us to the blood.

02:15.362 --> 02:16.146
So?

02:16.863 --> 02:19.950
- What's taking so long, Professor? Hmm?
- I'm stuck.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.024
You mean your cock's stuck
inside this woman.

02:23.049 --> 02:26.518
Come on, man. You gotta let me
slide on this one. It's new.

02:27.424 --> 02:28.218
New?

02:29.709 --> 02:33.648
When I was kid... I lost my junk.

02:34.553 --> 02:36.636
It was a smelting accident.

02:37.217 --> 02:40.468
Why the hell you think I wore that
derringer down there all those years?

02:40.493 --> 02:43.102
I mean, think about it.
Who calls himself Sex Machine?

02:43.127 --> 02:44.885
I was overcompensating.

02:45.058 --> 02:48.641
When I became a <i> Culebro...</i>
it grew back!

02:50.425 --> 02:51.476
You blame me?

02:53.795 --> 02:55.774
I gave her my venom, homey.

02:58.765 --> 03:00.955
OK, look, OK,
the bottom line is:

03:00.991 --> 03:03.408
we know that there's
four bonds missing.

03:03.410 --> 03:06.555
And... I thought I could
solve it. Without 'em.

03:06.797 --> 03:09.561
But I can't. I need those
missing pages.

03:13.498 --> 03:15.003
Then I guess I'd better find 'em.

03:15.584 --> 03:18.006
No. Listen!
Hold on...

03:23.396 --> 03:25.702
Aw, man,
what'd you do that for?

03:26.650 --> 03:28.324
Focus, Professor.

03:29.186 --> 03:32.156
Our future...
your future depends on it.

04:02.819 --> 04:04.126
I heard all the stories.

04:04.936 --> 04:07.193
The Rangers made a bad name
for themselves back then.

04:07.913 --> 04:09.907
That's why they call it
the bad old days.

04:13.194 --> 04:14.590
Sometimes...

04:16.874 --> 04:19.825
even the worst kind
of brutality has its place.

04:20.153 --> 04:21.422
What place is that?

04:23.790 --> 04:25.536
Place of dead roads.

04:26.351 --> 04:28.333
Last stop before hell.

04:32.832 --> 04:35.338
<i>Ranger Gonzalez, we
have examined all five bodies</i>

04:35.363 --> 04:36.701
<i>you found at the mass grave.</i>

04:36.862 --> 04:38.670
<i>We confirmed that
all their knees</i>

04:38.672 --> 04:40.977
<i>were broken with
the same blunt instrument.</i>

04:41.531 --> 04:43.841
<i>And the depth of indentations
on their foreheads</i>

04:43.894 --> 04:46.631
<i>suggest the markings were made
with a human fingernail.</i>

04:47.285 --> 04:50.129
There was another mass grave
found in eighty-seven.

04:50.154 --> 04:53.407
Same knee-capped migrants,
symbols, the whole thing.

04:54.651 --> 04:56.426
- Anyone put up a fight?
- They did.

04:56.451 --> 05:00.881
Our vic has some of the killer's
blood underneath his fingernails.

05:03.494 --> 05:04.893
Can you give us a second?

05:05.081 --> 05:06.728
I'd like some time
with the victim.

05:07.269 --> 05:08.472
Right.

05:12.894 --> 05:14.304
You don't have to do this.

05:15.851 --> 05:19.434
Scott went on a rampage just to
prove himself to these people.

05:19.921 --> 05:21.947
And I would like to
know how to fight them.

05:50.298 --> 05:51.292
What are those?

05:51.317 --> 05:52.509
Bearer bonds.

05:52.731 --> 05:55.194
Stolen by the Geckos
at the <i> culebras'</i> request.

05:56.082 --> 06:00.023
Seth tried to give them to his
ex-wife, but I intercepted 'em.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.158
Them vipers got the rest.

06:04.957 --> 06:06.263
How do you know?

06:07.051 --> 06:08.761
Your brother showed 'em to me.

06:09.596 --> 06:10.870
When we traded blood.

06:12.547 --> 06:15.670
<i>Culebras</i> think they're key
to some ancient blood source.

06:17.395 --> 06:19.586
Somehow, they're related
to this serial killer.

06:19.823 --> 06:21.946
OK, that seems like
a long shot.

06:21.971 --> 06:25.498
Yeah, maybe. But my mentor 
used to say...

06:26.946 --> 06:30.621
'A Ranger's job is to look
unspeakable evil in the eye...

06:31.782 --> 06:33.108
and spit.'

06:34.621 --> 06:35.823
And who was that?

06:36.206 --> 06:39.363
Earl McGraw. A legend.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.194
Well, I doubt Earl McGraw ever had
to look a <i> culebra</i> in the eye.

06:46.800 --> 06:49.500
I... I don't think that's
gonna work with a dead guy.

06:49.636 --> 06:51.602
Not his blood
I'm interested in.

06:51.719 --> 06:53.547
The killer left behind
some of his.

07:11.900 --> 07:13.250
Ranger Gonzalez?!

07:26.770 --> 07:27.805
Freddie!

07:28.840 --> 07:29.676
Freddie!

07:41.855 --> 07:44.644
Freddie! Freddie, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

07:45.747 --> 07:47.002
I saw 'em die,

07:48.222 --> 07:50.102
I saw 'em all die.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.528
You can sit this one out.

08:16.534 --> 08:19.088
Really. You should
get some rest.

08:19.471 --> 08:21.207
I don't need rest, Richard.

08:29.631 --> 08:31.181
This is gonna be good for you.

08:33.143 --> 08:34.738
Why did you even tell
Uncle Eddie?

08:34.763 --> 08:36.474
We could've figured out
some other play on our own,

08:36.503 --> 08:38.169
and then I would've been
done with my brother

08:38.211 --> 08:40.645
- and all of his bullshit for good.
- You don't want to be done with him.

08:40.669 --> 08:42.484
And he's onto something, Seth, OK?

08:42.509 --> 08:44.350
If we just get a piece of this
cartel stash,

08:44.384 --> 08:46.000
- then we are set.
- Listen, listen to me.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.231
- This is what you fail to understand, OK?
- What?

08:48.388 --> 08:50.638
My brother is not mixed up
with a cartel.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.997
They are... much worse.

08:53.022 --> 08:54.524
These people are animals.

08:58.648 --> 09:00.427
That's who you're
all worked up about?

09:00.524 --> 09:02.546
I mean, she can't be
that bad, right?

09:03.508 --> 09:04.537
Just wait.

09:15.499 --> 09:17.905
Evening guys, welcome to Char.
I'm Todd.

09:17.930 --> 09:19.596
Uh, any questions
on the menu so far?

09:19.621 --> 09:22.849
Nope. I'm gonna have the ribeye.
Medium rare.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.126
Beefsteak tomato and onion to start.
Garlic mash on the side.

09:26.161 --> 09:29.080
She's gonna have the petit filet
with the pear and manchego salad.

09:29.263 --> 09:30.997
- Make it skippy.
- I don't eat meat.

09:30.999 --> 09:32.616
- What?
- Yeah, I don't eat meat.

09:32.884 --> 09:36.436
Uh, can I please have the salad. And
asparagus on the side. Steamed.

09:36.471 --> 09:37.589
No butter, please.

09:38.807 --> 09:40.243
Um, what for you guys?

09:40.268 --> 09:42.863
We'll split
the Porterhouse. Rare.

09:43.412 --> 09:47.142
And, uh...
Lyonnaise potatoes.

09:48.116 --> 09:49.682
- Salad with that?
- Wine.

09:50.419 --> 09:52.685
- Your oldest red.
- Right on.

09:52.738 --> 09:55.853
I will be back
with you in a second.

09:57.802 --> 10:00.614
OK. Let's get down to it.

10:01.329 --> 10:03.726
Jacknife Jed's.
It's a truck stop.

10:03.751 --> 10:07.907
It is also a front for a very large,
very old outfit run by Amancio Malvado,

10:07.946 --> 10:10.670
who is, for lack
of a better word, the mark.

10:10.971 --> 10:12.919
Why are we all here
talking about it?

10:13.125 --> 10:16.843
Because if we want to use Uncle Eddie's
intel, we need to work together.

10:16.878 --> 10:19.879
It's the Gecko Brothers
and him, or it's nobody.

10:19.931 --> 10:21.627
We still have plenty
of recon to do,

10:21.652 --> 10:24.212
but it's a safe bet that Malvado's
got his loot underground,

10:24.237 --> 10:26.153
in some sort
of ancient stash.

10:26.354 --> 10:27.437
Ancient?

10:27.472 --> 10:28.938
It's just a figure of a speech.

10:28.974 --> 10:30.281
This is pointless.

10:30.306 --> 10:32.910
Why are we even
discussing this with them?

10:32.944 --> 10:35.528
Because Eddie said we had
to eat about it, all right?

10:35.564 --> 10:36.970
It's a thing he picked
up, back in the day,

10:36.995 --> 10:38.651
when he was a roadie
with Los Lobos.

10:38.740 --> 10:40.693
Any time the band
would get stuck on a song,

10:40.718 --> 10:42.518
couldn't write a hook,
or figure out a lyric,

10:42.543 --> 10:44.877
they'd have a meal.
They'd figure it out.

10:44.902 --> 10:47.221
We used to do the same
before every job.

10:47.986 --> 10:49.103
It works.

10:49.853 --> 10:51.204
Not this time.

10:51.237 --> 10:52.804
That's two different jobs.

10:53.010 --> 10:54.664
You wanna kill the boss.

10:54.937 --> 10:57.757
We just wanna rob him,
if we're even interested.

10:58.023 --> 11:01.079
Come on. A hit and a heist.

11:01.111 --> 11:02.711
- Plays like a two-fer.
- Yeah.

11:02.736 --> 11:04.160
Makes sense to me.

11:08.818 --> 11:12.383
It's a nice place.
Very uptown, huh?

11:13.349 --> 11:15.535
Switch your napkins
out and everything, huh?

11:15.937 --> 11:17.878
You see, sweetheart,
this is the kinda place

11:17.903 --> 11:19.632
you bring someone
when you want to impress 'em.

11:19.657 --> 11:22.029
Make 'em think you can
run the game, when, in fact,

11:22.054 --> 11:24.297
the only score you've ever
made has been a lay-up.

11:24.425 --> 11:26.476
You've been wearing Converse
All-Stars your whole life

11:26.501 --> 11:28.334
and you're gonna lace up
the Jordans now?

11:28.542 --> 11:31.347
It's a Kentucky quinella.
We've done it before.

11:31.372 --> 11:32.895
Yeah, and it was a shitty split.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.959
There is no split.
You can have it all.

11:34.984 --> 11:36.782
This isn't about
the money for us.

11:37.308 --> 11:38.292
OK.

11:39.183 --> 11:41.139
It's really not that hard, 
you know.

11:42.066 --> 11:44.149
- What's that?
- Riding shotgun.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.826
I've been doin'
it my whole life, brother.

11:47.943 --> 11:51.175
You see, Seth drives
the really fast cars.

11:51.556 --> 11:52.939
I do all the real work.

11:53.141 --> 11:57.186
OK, look, why don't we all
just count to ten,

11:57.479 --> 12:01.344
- and... try and help each other out.
- I don't need your help.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.629
As a matter of fact,
I don't need anyone's help.

12:04.654 --> 12:06.857
Really? Remind me what happens

12:06.896 --> 12:08.497
- when you get hungry.
- What is that supposed to mean?

12:08.522 --> 12:09.991
- You know what it means.
- If you got something to say to her,

12:10.016 --> 12:11.483
- you can say it to me.
- I don't wanna get bit in the middle of a job.

12:11.508 --> 12:13.156
Get bit? What are you talkin'
about, 'get bit'?

12:14.496 --> 12:15.935
- Hmm?
- It's nothing.

12:16.071 --> 12:18.967
- Yeah, it's just a figure of speech.
- It's fear.

12:21.175 --> 12:25.205
It's really funny how you all
run around like little monkeys.

12:26.163 --> 12:27.963
I'm not afraid of Malvado.

12:28.132 --> 12:30.866
I know where he is. I just need
to get there and kill him.

12:30.891 --> 12:33.008
We can't just walk in.
We need a play.

12:33.033 --> 12:36.001
We don't need your brother and
his little <i> sucia</i> girlfriend...

12:36.033 --> 12:38.711
<i>- Sucia?</i> Who you calling <i>sucia,</i> bitch?
- Hey, watch your mouth.

12:38.736 --> 12:41.030
- Look, they could be a good distraction.
- Ah.

12:41.187 --> 12:43.271
So that's what we are.
A distraction.

12:43.376 --> 12:45.279
What did I tell you,
Sonja. Animals.

12:45.782 --> 12:47.563
We don't want to be
in business with these people.

12:47.588 --> 12:49.752
Because we do whatever
it takes to survive?

12:50.423 --> 12:52.902
Isn't that what animals do, Seth?

12:58.228 --> 13:00.654
All right, well,
this animal's thirsty.

13:01.509 --> 13:03.026
I'm going to go to the bar.

13:11.456 --> 13:12.816
That was trippy.

13:14.068 --> 13:14.819
Yeah.

13:15.842 --> 13:18.850
You kept rambling about
how you saw them all die.

13:21.006 --> 13:22.505
A thousand people.

13:23.756 --> 13:24.996
Buried alive.

13:25.733 --> 13:28.289
Tossed into a pit
by one of the Nine Lords.

13:29.779 --> 13:32.097
- You mean one of the bosses?
- Yeah.

13:32.574 --> 13:35.758
Didn't you see one of them when you...
did the same thing with Scott?

13:37.107 --> 13:39.596
No, that was Malvado.
Different guy.

13:39.716 --> 13:41.179
- Oh.
- This one...

13:43.138 --> 13:44.647
I couldn't see him.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.480
But I could feel him.

13:49.974 --> 13:51.307
This is crazy.

13:52.661 --> 13:54.434
No, I...

13:54.661 --> 13:57.865
think we just left Crazy Town
and went into Batshit City.

13:59.980 --> 14:02.827
You're never gonna believe
who the Ranger was on this case.

14:06.332 --> 14:08.136
<i>He found a mass grave in '87,</i>

14:08.161 --> 14:10.749
<i>and he started to
investigate the local migrants.</i>

14:20.687 --> 14:22.914
<i>OK, right here it says
that Earl McGraw</i>

14:23.508 --> 14:26.398
<i>went to a home improvement warehouse
on the east side of town,</i>

14:26.423 --> 14:27.665
- and...
- And?

14:29.331 --> 14:33.542
Nothing.
He didn't find anything.

14:34.578 --> 14:35.938
No witness statements?

14:37.414 --> 14:39.500
He would have filed those.
It's like he just stopped.

14:39.547 --> 14:42.042
- Why would he stop?
- I'm sure he had his reasons.

14:44.432 --> 14:45.544
Afternoon, Captain.

14:45.893 --> 14:49.605
D.P.S. says Tony Mendoza hasn't
reported for duty in three days.

14:49.751 --> 14:50.978
His wife can't find him.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.037
His brothers ain't
seen hide nor hair.

14:53.087 --> 14:56.590
G.P.S. on his Ranger vehicle?
It's not registering.

14:56.615 --> 14:58.623
Hmm. That doesn't
make any sense.

14:58.728 --> 15:02.100
I never put much trust
in that technobabble anyhow.

15:02.362 --> 15:04.229
Wasn't he workin' on
a case with you?

15:04.979 --> 15:06.159
Not anymore.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.171
Ma'am.

15:16.074 --> 15:17.976
- What was that?
- Nothing.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.521
Something happened to that cop.

15:22.260 --> 15:23.798
He wasn't just a cop.

15:24.416 --> 15:25.944
He was Billy's godfather.

15:26.775 --> 15:28.114
Sex Machine killed him.

15:28.456 --> 15:29.656
It doesn't matter right now.

15:29.776 --> 15:31.051
It doesn't matter?

15:31.076 --> 15:32.567
They're up to something, Kate.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.202
The more time we waste, the closer
they are to figuring it out.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.707
OK, that's just mean.

16:03.491 --> 16:04.856
Welcome home.

16:07.436 --> 16:09.384
You know, you and I
have something in common.

16:09.409 --> 16:10.610
What's that?

16:12.125 --> 16:16.586
I'm the only other <i> vato</i>
who ever beat the Labyrinth.

16:17.839 --> 16:20.192
Well, doesn't that
make you special.

16:21.675 --> 16:22.887
Maybe.

16:23.581 --> 16:25.515
No such thing as special.

16:31.315 --> 16:33.585
What am I going to do with you, Carlitos?

16:42.413 --> 16:44.363
Shot of Patrón. Añejo.

16:44.415 --> 16:47.673
- That kind of night, huh?
- Oh, you have no idea, my friend.

16:47.735 --> 16:49.579
- We'll get ya squared away right quick.
- OK, thank you.

16:56.594 --> 16:57.985
Relax.

16:59.378 --> 17:01.640
I told you I would
call you when I could, OK?

17:01.666 --> 17:04.517
I just got here. OK.

17:07.451 --> 17:09.354
I couldn't stand it, either.

17:13.753 --> 17:14.998
Calling someone?

17:17.198 --> 17:18.349
Thank you.

17:22.970 --> 17:25.063
You got something
you want to say to me?

17:29.537 --> 17:32.221
Well, I am the one that
talked Seth into coming here,

17:32.268 --> 17:35.127
and as far as I can tell, we're not
going to be here for very long.

17:35.152 --> 17:37.709
So, the less I have to
talk to you, the better.

17:40.814 --> 17:42.740
Goddammit. Shit.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.405
Dammit.

17:50.758 --> 17:51.954
- Let me help you.
- No.

17:53.015 --> 17:54.385
Please, thank you.

18:28.426 --> 18:31.039
- Here's those files, Ranger Gonzalez.
- Thank you.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.624
This is everything they
cleaned out of Earl's office.

18:35.232 --> 18:37.507
We might be able to find
something in his old notebooks.

18:42.539 --> 18:43.651
Oh, my God.

18:45.559 --> 18:46.662
Is that you?

18:47.520 --> 18:48.896
Yeah, that's me.

18:52.866 --> 18:55.098
He was like a father to you,
wasn't he?

18:55.710 --> 18:57.335
Not like a father.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.429
OK, here's something.

19:06.274 --> 19:09.321
Earl found a migrant worker
by the name of Gabriel Cruz.

19:09.363 --> 19:12.339
He had a bandaged forehead
and a partial wound...

19:12.502 --> 19:14.089
<i>A victim who got away.</i>

19:34.557 --> 19:37.191
<i>He told Earl he got attacked
after he got hired by a guy</i>

19:37.216 --> 19:39.336
<i>in a pickup truck
with this symbol on it.</i>

19:47.037 --> 19:49.370
The notes say it belongs
to an oil company.

19:49.372 --> 19:50.623
Oil company?

19:53.426 --> 19:55.060
Yeah, but he ain't follow up.

19:55.344 --> 19:57.320
Well, then I guess
we'll have to.

20:05.752 --> 20:07.689
So I visited the Professor.

20:08.391 --> 20:11.657
He has hit the wall trying to
decipher the rest of the map.

20:12.853 --> 20:14.750
There are four bonds missing.

20:16.426 --> 20:17.930
Do you know where they are?

20:23.261 --> 20:26.423
Come on, let's stop fucking
around, Carlitos.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.417
Let's take our natural places
on this stage.

20:29.672 --> 20:32.884
Me, the businessman.
You, the impresario.

20:32.909 --> 20:37.248
Oh, we can make a deal that's
beneficial for both of us. Huh?

20:37.787 --> 20:41.003
I give you the map.
What do I get in return?

20:42.475 --> 20:43.738
The Twister?

20:44.351 --> 20:46.069
Run it however you wish.

20:46.499 --> 20:48.890
You're good at it,
Carlitos, huh?

20:49.116 --> 20:50.641
Clearly, I'm not.

20:52.068 --> 20:53.590
You're good at stealing.

20:54.372 --> 20:56.072
Narciso Menendez.

20:56.505 --> 21:00.611
_

21:03.064 --> 21:04.608
_

21:05.936 --> 21:07.467
_

21:11.888 --> 21:13.116
And now what?

21:13.589 --> 21:16.683
You're going to allow me
to be your employee?

21:16.708 --> 21:17.476
Mm-mm.

21:18.594 --> 21:20.003
Partners,<i> cabrón.</i>

21:20.461 --> 21:23.297
You should just tell me
where the rest of the map is,

21:23.602 --> 21:27.369
we can find this blood source, and then...
we'll share the reward.

21:29.605 --> 21:31.017
I don't believe you.

21:33.109 --> 21:38.149
We're not animals, Carlitos.
We live by a code. Don't we?

21:38.836 --> 21:41.135
Now, my driver is
waiting for me outside.

21:42.055 --> 21:43.758
I need an answer.

21:55.323 --> 21:56.679
What are you doin',
little boy?

21:56.799 --> 21:59.094
Just chillin'.
What are you doin'?

22:11.233 --> 22:12.911
The answer, Carlitos.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.827
- Almost ready to go.
- Yes.

22:18.821 --> 22:20.135
Yes, you are.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.392
I see you found
your ocean to cross.

22:29.757 --> 22:30.796
Good.

22:31.717 --> 22:32.883
What did you learn?

22:33.336 --> 22:34.816
I learned I don't
like the ocean.

22:38.057 --> 22:41.313
Relax. We live by a code.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.862
You were right, Kate.
This is an oil company.

23:01.541 --> 23:04.760
This mansion's built like a fortress.
They're definitely hiding something.

23:05.790 --> 23:07.532
Doesn't look like
anybody's home.

23:09.718 --> 23:11.100
Company's on the title.

23:12.883 --> 23:14.409
Owner's name's not listed.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.490
Well, then, we should
be ready to meet him.

23:22.663 --> 23:23.970
I've been thinking, Kate.

23:25.147 --> 23:26.295
About what?

23:27.436 --> 23:29.345
About the next time
you see Scott.

23:30.643 --> 23:33.393
- And what about that?
- What happens then?

23:37.284 --> 23:38.979
Whatever has to happen.

23:41.404 --> 23:42.377
OK.

23:55.084 --> 23:56.371
It's still cold, Freddie.

23:57.295 --> 23:58.162
Freddie, look out!

24:10.016 --> 24:10.858
Kate!

24:25.865 --> 24:29.350
You're a strong one.
He'll be pleased to see you.

24:29.631 --> 24:32.125
- Very pleased.
- Who?

25:09.625 --> 25:11.262
You're not
wearing your star.

25:11.494 --> 25:12.730
Hands in the air.

25:18.834 --> 25:19.941
Who are you?

25:20.253 --> 25:22.586
You want the real answer
or the cryptic one?

25:22.638 --> 25:25.074
- I'm really good at both.
- Your name.

25:25.206 --> 25:26.800
Celestino Oculto.

25:27.345 --> 25:30.125
I know, I know.
A little much.

25:30.501 --> 25:35.382
When we arrived here, it
was a very, very big show.

25:35.694 --> 25:37.086
Arrived here?

25:37.804 --> 25:39.238
To this realm.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.490
- Get up.
- What are you going to do?

25:43.526 --> 25:45.559
Take me downtown and
ask me some questions?

25:45.594 --> 25:46.681
I said get up.

25:47.274 --> 25:48.946
Save yourself the trouble.

26:17.949 --> 26:19.682
Kate, we found
our serial killer.

26:21.976 --> 26:23.905
Had the same M.O.
for a thousand years.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.446
Serial killer?

26:28.960 --> 26:31.456
But I'm so much more
interesting than that.

26:45.735 --> 26:47.005
I'm done waitin'.

27:21.187 --> 27:23.607
- Ah, yes, sir. What can I get for you?
- He needs Tabasco.

27:33.846 --> 27:36.818
I knew it.
I could feel it.

27:37.304 --> 27:39.236
So, which of
the Nine Lords are you?

27:42.259 --> 27:43.644
The coolest one.

27:45.212 --> 27:47.164
You're out here
in the middle of nowhere.

27:47.642 --> 27:50.541
Where's your operation?
How do you feed?

27:51.979 --> 27:53.262
Who needs it,

27:53.510 --> 27:55.638
when I have tasty morsels
like you

27:55.690 --> 27:57.501
coming to my door?

28:01.127 --> 28:03.867
<i>Señorita, where are you manners?</i>

28:04.509 --> 28:06.866
I know you think you're
all high and mighty,

28:07.814 --> 28:10.594
last time I checked, there's
only one Lord on this planet.

28:10.619 --> 28:12.102
You're adorable.

28:12.596 --> 28:13.656
Just so you know,

28:13.708 --> 28:15.727
I'm not the
only killer in this room.

28:17.065 --> 28:19.845
Ask the Ranger here what
happened to his first partner.

28:20.581 --> 28:22.797
Tony was already dead.
I didn't kill him.

28:23.721 --> 28:25.426
One of you killed him.

28:26.130 --> 28:28.068
Had to fake his death
to cover it up.

28:28.083 --> 28:31.760
To maintain the balance
between our world, and yours.

28:32.760 --> 28:35.477
Between dusk and dawn.

28:35.877 --> 28:38.238
Well, you're not the first one
to learn that lesson...

28:38.599 --> 28:39.849
Frederico.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.755
What are you talkin' about?

28:45.906 --> 28:49.641
Fantasy gives us a means to deal
with the horrors of the real world,

28:49.906 --> 28:51.607
to take the things that scare us

28:51.632 --> 28:54.554
and fashion them into a
<i> mythos</i> that we can live with.

28:55.137 --> 29:00.171
Fantasy allows us to confront,
and defeat, unspeakable evil.

29:03.945 --> 29:05.882
I can think of
some other ways.

29:11.579 --> 29:12.985
Six of 'em, actually.

29:13.681 --> 29:16.958
Let's talk about these migrants
your boy picked up here.

29:17.142 --> 29:19.355
And then let's talk about how
they ended up dead in a ditch

29:19.390 --> 29:21.820
- with their knees smashed in.
- Happy to.

29:22.343 --> 29:26.605
First, I'd like you to take a
look at one of my newest stories.

29:27.679 --> 29:29.152
Just published.

29:30.234 --> 29:32.403
Tomás here did
most of the research.

30:04.334 --> 30:06.420
Looks like a bunch
of bullshit to me.

30:09.654 --> 30:13.170
Stories have been a passion of
mine for a very long time, Ranger.

30:13.244 --> 30:16.869
I am fascinated by characters.
I like to get under their skin

30:16.916 --> 30:18.892
and see what gets
their blood pumping.

30:22.734 --> 30:26.363
If you'd like me to make your daughter
into one of my enduring passions,

30:27.047 --> 30:30.609
please, feel free to pursue
your line of questioning.

30:34.317 --> 30:36.720
Your mentor knew
when to look the other way.

30:46.899 --> 30:48.198
So should you.

30:52.686 --> 30:55.236
Now, please, sit down.

31:11.721 --> 31:12.885
Quinella, huh?

31:12.920 --> 31:14.059
Yeah.

31:15.455 --> 31:16.743
So what do you say?

31:19.356 --> 31:20.698
I say...

31:24.815 --> 31:26.204
it's a nice place.

31:32.184 --> 31:33.844
Where the hell are they,
anyway?

31:51.855 --> 31:53.840
You can tell Seth I'm fine.

31:54.495 --> 31:56.321
Don't need you
to check in on me.

31:56.380 --> 31:58.539
Oh, I know, I know.

31:59.044 --> 32:02.101
You can take care
of yourself just fine.

32:05.508 --> 32:08.620
I know things about people,
Sonja.

32:09.758 --> 32:11.391
I can sense them.

32:12.696 --> 32:13.846
That's great.

32:14.618 --> 32:16.096
I'm happy for you.

32:18.373 --> 32:21.685
I sense something in you.

32:27.628 --> 32:30.544
You're about to sense
my fist in your face.

32:33.776 --> 32:35.708
Who did you make a deal with?

32:36.792 --> 32:39.744
Tell me. Who.

32:41.013 --> 32:41.976
Hey!

32:42.583 --> 32:44.941
Get away from her, you freak!

32:45.229 --> 32:46.569
She's fucking crazy.

32:47.565 --> 32:48.796
Wait a second...

32:51.279 --> 32:53.068
She's hiding something.

32:53.810 --> 32:55.791
I'm gonna go finish my steak.

33:01.465 --> 33:05.234
Who the hell am I kiddin'?
I ain't cut out for this.

33:05.328 --> 33:07.596
Nobody's beggin' you to be a Ranger.

33:07.897 --> 33:09.381
But you ain't gonna quit.

33:10.077 --> 33:13.822
Why? 'Cause you got
the soul of a Ranger.

33:14.397 --> 33:16.956
You know that
you're part of somethin' bigger.

33:17.405 --> 33:21.142
You're part of the last line of
defense between chaos and order.

33:25.267 --> 33:26.898
Found this in his truck.

33:30.915 --> 33:32.734
Earl McGraw knew the score.

33:33.251 --> 33:34.663
When the sun goes down,

33:34.688 --> 33:38.716
the world turns upside down, a
fella needs a map to find the way.

33:38.931 --> 33:40.852
I created these bonds
as a guide.

33:41.672 --> 33:44.824
- In case something ever happens to me.
- A guide to what?

33:49.166 --> 33:52.176
You were right, Kate.
I do need to feed.

33:53.777 --> 33:55.092
But what was I gonna do,

33:55.511 --> 33:58.162
be a tired old vampire
from the pulps?

33:58.535 --> 34:01.346
Leaping on innocent souls
in dark rooms

34:01.534 --> 34:04.756
and biting them
in a vaguely sexual way?

34:09.259 --> 34:10.820
Who has time for that?

34:12.362 --> 34:13.931
I had a better idea.

34:15.072 --> 34:16.255
Tomás.

34:18.112 --> 34:19.402
<i>Lárgate.</i>

34:25.166 --> 34:26.099
Kate...

34:38.466 --> 34:41.476
The Nine Lords.
My brothers and sisters.

34:41.793 --> 34:45.665
They each built an illicit
operation to keep themselves fed.

34:46.130 --> 34:48.674
Amancio Malvado, the oldest,

34:48.699 --> 34:52.360
naturally had to have
the flashiest one.

34:54.070 --> 34:55.757
The 'Titty Twister.'

34:56.014 --> 34:57.684
Well, it works pretty well.

34:58.414 --> 35:01.186
For him. Me?

35:01.995 --> 35:03.723
I like a good story.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.650
So let me lay one on you.

35:06.302 --> 35:10.218
Once upon a time, there were people
who yearned to rid themselves

35:10.253 --> 35:12.315
of the <i> culebra</i> scourge.

35:12.422 --> 35:14.589
I sold them a brilliant idea.

35:14.591 --> 35:17.842
Offer a thousand souls
to the gods,

35:17.894 --> 35:20.949
and it will end the curse
of the serpent men.

35:23.754 --> 35:26.149
So you buried
an entire village alive.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.839
You tricked them
into mass suicide.

35:29.238 --> 35:30.655
I know, right?

35:33.712 --> 35:38.278
That's why their souls became
the <i> Barolo</i> of <i> Sangre.</i>

35:39.399 --> 35:41.747
All that agony and pain

35:42.207 --> 35:43.856
buried underground

35:44.746 --> 35:47.059
concentrated in one sip.

35:47.230 --> 35:51.000
Blood of kings.
The king of blood.

36:00.022 --> 36:01.709
Powerful stuff.

36:02.186 --> 36:03.230
Hmm?

36:04.717 --> 36:06.736
One poor soul
found it once.

36:06.928 --> 36:10.215
A prospector.
Back in the Spindletop days.

36:10.530 --> 36:13.494
Let's just say it was a gusher.

36:16.147 --> 36:19.036
You created the oil company.
To hide it.

36:19.072 --> 36:23.657
To disguise it, like a well.
Like a bloodwell.

36:23.793 --> 36:27.311
Hey, I like the sound of that!
I'm gonna use it.

36:29.465 --> 36:32.834
Peacekeeper, your job,
among many others,

36:32.886 --> 36:34.919
is to make sure
that that never opens.

36:34.971 --> 36:38.927
If that blood is to fall
into the... wrong fangs, ah...

36:39.175 --> 36:41.397
I don't want to write
the end of that story.

36:42.370 --> 36:44.571
You buried bodies in '87,

36:44.722 --> 36:46.690
you did it again
a few months ago.

36:47.893 --> 36:49.362
Why do you keep killing?

36:50.245 --> 36:51.808
The weapon demands it.

36:59.730 --> 37:01.702
This is the key to everything.

37:03.249 --> 37:04.904
And it stays here with me.

37:06.124 --> 37:07.786
And I remain anonymous.

37:10.728 --> 37:13.128
You want me to look away.
Like Earl.

37:15.431 --> 37:18.389
He knew the score.
So did your father.

37:20.915 --> 37:23.482
You don't remember the day
you met Earl McGraw.

37:23.686 --> 37:25.569
You assumed that
he was always around...

37:27.075 --> 37:28.306
I found the killer.

37:28.358 --> 37:30.658
But I don't know if I can
ever bring him down.

37:30.683 --> 37:33.841
Oculto will live forever
and he will find me.

37:34.178 --> 37:36.217
Which is why I cannot stay here.

37:36.628 --> 37:38.467
I need you
to watch over my son.

37:44.631 --> 37:47.205
- I can't accept that responsibility.
- Please.

37:47.435 --> 37:50.443
His mother will raise him, but you?

37:50.901 --> 37:54.128
You have to make sure
Federico becomes a man.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.221
Now you remember.

38:09.246 --> 38:11.247
It's a fantastic yarn.

38:11.317 --> 38:16.512
Crusty old Ranger takes on an eager
young sidekick who, one day,

38:16.537 --> 38:17.773
will fill his shoes.

38:18.615 --> 38:21.156
Ah, Ranger Rogelio,

38:21.611 --> 38:24.756
the white hat...
of the Rio Grande!

38:27.417 --> 38:29.232
Let's say I even
consider walking.

38:29.301 --> 38:30.674
What happens next?

38:31.621 --> 38:34.288
What if the visions don't stop?
I can't do that to my family.

38:34.290 --> 38:35.323
Visions?

38:35.884 --> 38:38.715
You had a vision of the bloodwell
before you touched my blood?

38:38.990 --> 38:41.545
Nah. That's not possible.

38:42.545 --> 38:43.760
Unless...

38:43.800 --> 38:47.377
- Unless what?
- Someone put those visions in his head...

39:14.546 --> 39:17.498
Go! Take that and go to the cellar.
And lock the door from inside.

39:17.500 --> 39:18.833
- Who's here?
- Go,<i> Rinche!</i>

39:18.835 --> 39:20.173
You're too important.

39:32.948 --> 39:35.340
That's him. That's Malvado.

39:35.512 --> 39:38.708
Ah,<i> Huevón!</i> You're too late.

39:38.932 --> 39:40.021
He's gone.

39:40.721 --> 39:44.390
You put that idea in his head,
then you follow him here.

39:44.932 --> 39:46.611
You knew that he would find me.

39:46.767 --> 39:48.593
Like his teacher before him.

39:51.315 --> 39:54.001
Hmm,<i> El Regulador.</i>
I'm honored.

39:54.037 --> 39:55.457
You should be.

40:21.204 --> 40:24.899
Finally. The key.

40:25.393 --> 40:27.127
Why do you 
even care, brother?

40:27.203 --> 40:30.254
Your 'Santanico Pandemonium'
should keep you fed.

40:31.088 --> 40:33.066
Pretty soon I'll have her, too.

40:36.243 --> 40:38.019
I'd forgotten how it feels.

40:38.214 --> 40:40.020
It's useless without the map.

40:41.402 --> 40:43.287
Let me worry about that.

40:52.455 --> 40:55.879
Stop! We can't beat him.
He's too strong.

40:56.236 --> 40:57.767
Trust me, I know.

40:59.313 --> 41:01.479
Time to leave this realm, <i>mi hermano.</i>

41:02.655 --> 41:04.491
Time to leave it for good.

41:37.907 --> 41:38.998
Let's go.

41:56.003 --> 41:57.076
You see?

41:58.058 --> 41:59.814
Scott learned his lesson.

42:02.014 --> 42:04.078
This reminds me
of something I learned

42:04.103 --> 42:05.822
from my first commander.

42:08.033 --> 42:12.521
Sometimes... you have to
burn your ships.

42:13.225 --> 42:15.187
I made you
a good offer, homey.

42:15.538 --> 42:18.210
Yeah? You're a businessman.

42:18.280 --> 42:21.308
Let me offer you the same
transaction you offered me.

42:31.758 --> 42:33.166
Lick my boot,

42:34.497 --> 42:36.080
and I will set you free.

42:36.395 --> 42:39.489
If you do this,
you will be breaking

42:39.514 --> 42:43.293
everything we stand for,
everything we live by.

42:45.181 --> 42:47.485
See, Narciso,
that's always been your problem.

42:48.626 --> 42:50.381
You think there are rules.

42:50.846 --> 42:53.592
But everyone knows
what rules were made for.

43:08.829 --> 43:10.217
Put it in the car.

43:22.044 --> 43:23.283
It was a myth.

43:24.153 --> 43:26.770
Cortez didn't burn his ships.

43:27.308 --> 43:28.768
He ran them aground.

43:29.870 --> 43:31.848
That doesn't sound sexy,
does it?

43:32.925 --> 43:34.912
When he came to this place,

43:35.441 --> 43:38.062
they mistook my commander
for a god.

43:52.908 --> 43:54.716
They had the wrong man.
