08:51.865 --> 08:53.825
Wait, how do you know that
something definitely happened?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.869
Because it did.
He has a tattoo.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.287
Are you listening to me?

08:57.328 --> 08:58.830
[laughs]
Yeah.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.373
And the fact that
I've called him four times

09:00.415 --> 09:01.916
and he hasn't called back
kinda says something.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.877
Wow. Okay, you know
what's wrong with that story?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.962
That he hasn't
called me back?

09:06.004 --> 09:08.506
No, the fact that you called
him or anyone four times.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.009
I mean, good God, girl,
look at you.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.345
Okay, so what
do I do, then?

09:18.058 --> 09:19.976
[gunshots]

09:20.018 --> 09:21.853
Can we do this all day?

09:22.854 --> 09:24.981
Not bad,
cheerleader.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.525
Are both these
yours?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.903
No, they're my dad's.
He collects them.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.739
Okay, make sure you hold your
hand kinda like further back.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.865
Yeah.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.869
Beats the hell outta making
Rice Krispies treats.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.041
Tara!

09:44.084 --> 09:45.919
That you?
What are you doin' here?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.087
Oh, nothing.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.755
Just wishing I could,

09:48.755 --> 09:50.381
you know,
build a time machine

09:50.423 --> 09:53.051
and go back and shoot
whoever it is invented algebra.

09:53.093 --> 09:53.927
That's for sure.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.845
See, that's kinda
a catch‐22, though,

09:55.887 --> 09:57.514
because to invent
that time machine,

09:57.555 --> 10:00.433
you may need
to use algebra, so...

10:00.433 --> 10:02.519
You know, I already
have a tutor, if that's‐‐

10:02.560 --> 10:04.395
So you can just,
yeah, run along.
Okay.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.772
Let me ask you
one question, though.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.441
Um, did your tutor teach
Tim Riggins to read

10:08.441 --> 10:10.110
in about a day and a half?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.612
No? Okay.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.948
Is your tutor the top
of his calculus honors class?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.866
Shh.
Okay.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.953
Did your tutor score a 77

10:19.953 --> 10:22.080
on his PSAT math portion?

10:22.122 --> 10:25.458
No? I just really think
you need the A‐Team on this.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.752
And you got Mr. T standin'
right in front of you.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.587
And T stands‐‐

10:30.922 --> 10:34.509
for Tyra's algebra tutor.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.137
[laughing]

10:37.137 --> 10:38.054
Right?
Seriously?

10:38.096 --> 10:40.598
I'm really good at math.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.101
(Nikki)
I'm outta here.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.477
I have to go pick him up.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.604
I'm sure Bo's
the last kid there,

10:46.646 --> 10:48.815
and he's probably
scared out of his mind.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.400
Thank you.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.485
What?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.154
Tim picked me up.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.655
Well, hey!
School got cancelled.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.906
Lucky for you.

10:56.948 --> 10:59.075
I'm so glad.
I was worried about you.

10:59.117 --> 11:01.661
Okay, go in the break room
and go do your homework.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.829
[whines] Oh...

11:02.829 --> 11:03.830
There's cookies
in there.
Oh, boy!

11:03.830 --> 11:04.998
[laughs]

11:05.039 --> 11:07.041
Right around the corner.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.585
Thank you.
Hey.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.086
That was very sweet of you,
picking him up for me.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.129
No problem.
I was worried.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.673
It's probably not
a good idea

11:13.673 --> 11:15.175
for you to come in here,
though.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.968
Because...
Why?

11:17.010 --> 11:18.178
Well, because
it's a small town‐‐

11:18.178 --> 11:19.679
Hey, 33.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.847
Hey.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.098
Better buckle up
that chin strap.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.142
I hear those Viking boys
bring the wood.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.019
Oh, you bet.
We got it covered, though, sir.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.979
No worries.

11:28.021 --> 11:28.771
'Cause it's
a small t‐‐

11:28.813 --> 11:30.523
What do you want
for dinner tonight?

11:30.523 --> 11:31.691
What?

11:31.691 --> 11:32.734
I know Bo likes pizza,

11:32.775 --> 11:36.070
so we may as well grab
some of that or something.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.698
Sound good?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.450
Okay.
It's great.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.209
(player)
This is ridiculous.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.835
We're the freaking
Dillon Panthers.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.629
(Coach Taylor)
Get him, Spike.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.547
Man, this is worse
than Pee‐Wee.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.049
I think Coach T.
done lost his mind.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.884
(Taylor)
Hey, listen up.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.552
Everybody form over here
on the benches right now.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.054
Let's go. Go!
Come on, let's go, now.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.513
We got a lot to do today.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.514
Go!

12:05.058 --> 12:06.517
(Taylor)
Bunch of crybabies.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.561
I don't wanna hear
this crap anymore.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.063
You win a few games,
think you're special,

12:10.063 --> 12:11.898
think you're too good
to practice here.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.191
I don't wanna hear
that crap anymore.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.484
You know who you‐‐

12:17.028 --> 12:18.655
You know
who I'm talkin' about.

12:20.073 --> 12:23.201
Matt Saracen
found $200 in his locker.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.827
Who else?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.167
Nobody else.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.878
Nobody.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.049
Not in your locker?
Not anywhere at school?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.677
Not at home, nothin',
anywhere, anytime?

12:42.095 --> 12:44.097
That must piss you off,
Smash.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.724
Come on, let's go!

12:46.766 --> 12:48.101
(Buddy)
Coach.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.227
Coach.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.523
I think you're gonna
want to hear this, Eric.

12:53.564 --> 12:54.607
Hey, Mayor.
How you doing?
Okay.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.608
You all right, hon?
Yeah.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.609
What's going on?

12:56.651 --> 12:58.278
(Hunt)
We just heard from the EPA,

12:58.278 --> 12:59.862
and they are keeping
the school closed

12:59.904 --> 13:02.240
while they investigate
the accident.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.575
(Buddy)
Yeah. something about
toxic fumes.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.119
They have to evaluate
the air quality, Buddy.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.246
It's gonna be
at least a week.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.497
A week?

13:09.497 --> 13:11.958
There is no way you're gonna
have a home game this Friday.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.465
(facility director)
This is a great facility.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.760
It seats 12,000.
Six‐month old field turf, Coach.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.805
Check out the state‐of‐the‐art
press box up there.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.308
Coach, hi‐def
if you need it.
We're gonna pass.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.476
(Gainey)
I'm sorry, what?
We're gonna pass.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.645
You're gonna‐‐
Y'all signed a deal
we'd get a home game.

13:32.687 --> 13:33.730
And you know damn well

13:33.771 --> 13:35.648
this is a lot closer to Brant
than it is Dillon.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.691
[Gainey laughs]
A lot closer.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.401
Now you're just splitting
hairs, aren't we, Coach?

13:38.443 --> 13:39.569
This isn't splitting
any hairs.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.653
It's 20 miles
of difference...

13:40.695 --> 13:41.863
Come on,
don't try to hustle me.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.823
I saw the damn Vikings banner
back there in the weight room.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.491
I don't understand
what the problem is.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.367
I know you train here.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.578
I imagine you
practice here, play here.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.912
Can I ask you
a question too?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.539
Thank you.
Yeah.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.709
What‐‐does your brother
run the clock up there?

13:54.751 --> 13:56.586
Is that‐‐
that part of the deal?

13:56.627 --> 13:58.588
Coach, you know‐‐

14:00.631 --> 14:03.176
Don't make this
a pride thing, Coach.

14:03.217 --> 14:05.303
I said I'd split the rental
70/30.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.763
(Taylor)
Mm‐hmm.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.973
Not here, gentlemen.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.433
(Buddy)
Eric?

14:10.475 --> 14:11.601
(Taylor)
Not gonna be here.

14:11.642 --> 14:13.686
(Buddy)
Fine club seating,

14:13.686 --> 14:16.314
which would have been great
for my VIPs and my sponsors.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.649
You know, I'm real sorry
that you lost your sponsorship.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.651
Tell you what, why don't you
go out to Herrmann field

14:20.693 --> 14:22.695
and just buy that
and you can just call it

14:22.737 --> 14:24.530
"The Garrity Bowl"?

14:24.530 --> 14:27.784
Huh.
Are namin' rights available?

14:30.745 --> 14:32.538
Ad sales

14:32.580 --> 14:33.873
and ticket revenues‐‐

14:33.915 --> 14:36.459
that's what pays
your salary.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.670
My players have been
receiving gifts.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.715
Cash gifts, Buddy.

14:42.757 --> 14:43.925
Is that right?

14:47.261 --> 14:49.347
(Waverly)
...eat all that food
by yourself?

14:49.388 --> 14:50.890
[Lyla and Waverly giggling]

14:50.890 --> 14:53.017
See you later.
Call me, girl.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.895
[faint radio music]

14:55.937 --> 14:57.230
That's all right.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.898
[laughter]

14:58.940 --> 15:02.527
[overlapping chatter]

15:02.568 --> 15:04.403
Hey, Lyla.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.738
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

15:05.738 --> 15:06.781
Yeah.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.659
Since when did you and Waverly
get to be so friendly?

15:09.700 --> 15:12.537
You know, I've been cheering
for you all these years,

15:12.578 --> 15:14.622
and we've never said
so much as a "hey."

15:14.664 --> 15:16.791
And now you see me
with Waverly Grady, and...

15:16.833 --> 15:17.792
Look, I'm just‐‐

15:17.834 --> 15:19.043
I'm just asking.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.711
Great.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.714
You better be careful.
She's a good shot.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.591
What is that
supposed to mean?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.385
We went shooting
yesterday.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.845
Two girls
packing heat.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.596
No, no, no.
That's not a good idea.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.056
What?

15:32.098 --> 15:33.432
Why?

15:33.432 --> 15:35.268
God, Smash.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.936
You're not her father.
Lyla, it's not about‐‐

15:36.978 --> 15:38.271
She doesn't have to answer you
for everything that she does.
Lyla, Lyla.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.356
She's bipolar.
What?

15:40.398 --> 15:42.400
Waverly's bipolar.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.735
And she's not taking
her meds.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.737
Which means...

15:48.447 --> 15:49.448
I don't even know
what that means.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.868
But I'm damn sure
she shouldn't be shooting guns.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.333
I didn't know.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.043
Now you do.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.965
(Taylor)
That's not answering
the question.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.466
(Buddy)
Yeah, well, Eric,

16:07.466 --> 16:09.093
I don't think
I understand the question.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.304
You don't know anything about
that, do you, cash gifts?

16:11.345 --> 16:12.972
I don't think
we should be focusing on that.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.599
I think we need to focus on

16:14.640 --> 16:16.058
where we're gonna play
the football game.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.769
You have any idea where we're
gonna play the football game?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.522
You got a plan B
here for me?

16:25.443 --> 16:27.737
[cow moos]

16:31.616 --> 16:35.828
[mooing]

16:35.870 --> 16:39.373
[laughs]

16:39.373 --> 16:41.375
Come on.
Let's go get a beer.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.502
Come on.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.754
(Landry)
Okay, now what do you got

16:44.795 --> 16:46.464
after you take off
the times three?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.758
Okay. The square root of X
equals 7.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.092
How do you get rid of
that pesky little

16:50.134 --> 16:51.594
square root right there?

16:51.636 --> 16:52.595
Square both sides.

16:52.637 --> 16:53.429
Mm‐hmm.
Good.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.097
Good.
You square both sides‐‐

16:55.139 --> 16:56.849
You know, if you love
math so much,

16:56.891 --> 16:58.517
why don't you just start
your own little math club,

16:58.517 --> 16:59.852
and that way you can
do math all day long.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.647
Well, you see, I did,
but no‐nobody showed up.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.815
Yeah, that's shocking.
Really.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.859
You know, all this bitterness
that you're showing me

17:06.901 --> 17:08.027
really isn't helping.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.529
You know, I appreciate the fact
that you're talking to me

17:10.571 --> 17:11.864
and everything,
but it's not really‐‐
[laughing]

17:11.906 --> 17:13.032
it's not really helping
matters.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.618
So could we just maybe
solve for X?

17:15.660 --> 17:16.827
All right, X equals...

17:16.869 --> 17:18.037
49?

17:23.084 --> 17:25.044
I'm just playing.
That's right.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.712
Bastard!

26:59.618 --> 27:02.412
there is not a jury
in Carr County that is not

27:02.454 --> 27:04.665
gonna give us three times
what it is we're asking for.

27:04.665 --> 27:07.292
You know,
is that all I am here?

27:07.292 --> 27:09.628
Huh? Just some cripple boy
that you can wheel out

27:09.628 --> 27:11.588
in front of a bunch of people
to make some money off me?

27:11.630 --> 27:12.965
Jason.
Talk about lost
earning capacity

27:12.965 --> 27:14.550
like I'm some
brain‐dead idiot

27:14.591 --> 27:16.301
who's never
gonna get a job again.

27:16.301 --> 27:17.928
Okay, all right.
Mitch, we need to take a break.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.972
Seriously, Mom, Dad, I know
it's been hard on you guys,

27:19.972 --> 27:22.307
but we are not here
to win the lottery.

27:22.307 --> 27:25.769
So how 'bout‐‐how 'bout I
just write down

27:25.811 --> 27:26.979
what I want,

27:26.979 --> 27:29.398
and we call it a night?

27:31.316 --> 27:33.569
That takes care
of the debt, right?

27:33.610 --> 27:35.904
Saves the house?

27:37.656 --> 27:39.741
Jason...

27:39.783 --> 27:43.453
Jason, I just want you
to be okay.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.956
I just want you
to have a good life.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.958
I'm gonna be fine.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.835
You just gotta have faith
in me, okay?

27:49.835 --> 27:52.963
Can you do that?

27:54.798 --> 27:56.466
Okay.
Okay.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.394
[whispering]

28:08.854 --> 28:10.981
I think we can live
with this.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.784
(Gainey)
How you doin', Coach?
Good to see you.

28:22.826 --> 28:25.329
This is ridiculous.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.581
And what's worse is you're
actually serious about this.

28:27.581 --> 28:28.832
(Taylor)
Just let him read it to you.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.584
We shouldn't be having
this conversation.

28:30.584 --> 28:31.418
(UIL suit)
"Article one.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.462
"The field
shall be a rectangular area

28:33.503 --> 28:35.047
"with dimensions, lines,
goals, and pylons

28:35.047 --> 28:37.716
as shown in the diagrams
in appendix A."

28:37.716 --> 28:39.676
Now, you can measure
as many times as you want,

28:39.718 --> 28:41.553
but this is
an official field.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.721
I don't give a da‐‐I don't
care what the damn book says.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.014
We're not playing here.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.015
It's a football field.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.016
It's a joke!

28:46.058 --> 28:47.392
It's not a joke.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.560
It's a damn well‐built
football field.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.729
Look at this.
Look at this‐‐this‐‐

28:50.729 --> 28:52.856
This is the state
semifinals,

28:52.898 --> 28:54.316
for God's sake.

28:54.358 --> 28:55.859
I got my fans
to think about.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.527
What are you worried
about your fans for?

28:57.569 --> 28:58.862
I mean,
it's a sellout game.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.739
We're gonna be able
to get 'em all in here.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.574
You've already
made your money.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.034
It's not about
the money, Coach.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.494
I wasn't saying
it was about the money.

29:05.535 --> 29:06.703
I'm just say‐‐

29:06.745 --> 29:09.623
Well, I'm just curious about
what the problem is, Brandon.

29:09.623 --> 29:11.959
(Gainey)
Well, typically, what goes
along with a football game

29:11.959 --> 29:13.752
is a football stadium.

29:13.752 --> 29:14.753
Yes, sir.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.588
You know,
with good goal posts

29:16.588 --> 29:19.424
and something that's not battery
operated for a scoreboard.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.592
Oh, so I see.
I understand it.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.761
You have a problem
comin' down here

29:22.761 --> 29:25.430
without your fancy stadium
and your high‐tech gear

29:25.430 --> 29:26.598
because you're gonna get
your keisters beat.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.766
What I'm saying is

29:27.766 --> 29:28.892
it's a football game.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.936
What you need for a football
game is a football field,

29:30.936 --> 29:32.604
22 kids, and a pigskin.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.772
(UIL suit)
Gentlemen, are we gonna

29:33.772 --> 29:36.608
make a decision
sometime here today?

29:36.608 --> 29:37.442
Come on.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.944
All right, I tell you what,
Coach, look.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.571
It's‐‐it's obvious

29:41.613 --> 29:43.740
that you and your fine
folks at Dillon

29:43.782 --> 29:45.951
are having a really
rough time right now.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.120
We are, and I appreciate
your concern.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.121
You're welcome.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.831
Furthermore, my boys

29:50.831 --> 29:53.667
could kick your boys' butts
in an ice skating rink

29:53.667 --> 29:55.794
wearin' nothing but socks
if they had to.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.630
So let me tell you,
if you wanna go ahead and play

29:58.630 --> 30:00.465
on‐‐on this field,

30:00.465 --> 30:03.510
butch up, Sally,
'cause you got a game.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.160
Thanks, Coach.

Good evening,
Panther faithful,

30:34.916 --> 30:36.835
and welcome to the most
talked about football game

30:36.877 --> 30:38.837
in the state of Texas.

30:38.879 --> 30:40.839
We are playing
this football game

30:40.881 --> 30:43.133
in a cow pasture for lease.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.510
Not since the days
of the leather helmet

30:45.510 --> 30:47.137
have we seen the likes
of this here in Dillon.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.972
And you know what,
I'm dating myself, sports fans,

30:49.014 --> 30:51.767
but this has a feel
of Woodstock out here.

30:51.808 --> 30:52.893
And you know what,
I half expect to see

30:52.934 --> 30:54.978
the legendary Jimi Hendrix
come out here

30:55.020 --> 30:56.772
to play the national anthem.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.858
Yeah, I'm supposed
to have 50‐yard‐line seats.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.109
Tonight you get to sit
anywhere you want.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.820
It's just a big, wide,
open space out there.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.530
All right.
Enjoy.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.782
Nice field, Tex.

31:06.823 --> 31:07.866
Is your mama a goat roper?

31:07.908 --> 31:09.034
You can't even get in my head.

31:09.076 --> 31:11.203
You can't even get
in my head, baby.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.121
Bring it on the field.

31:15.248 --> 31:17.000
(referee)
Dillon, call the toss.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.043
Tails.

31:18.085 --> 31:19.169
He calls tails.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.004
It is tails.
We want the ball.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.881
(Albright)
Oh, sweet Mary,

31:22.923 --> 31:24.841
Gainey started
with an onside kick.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.010
Liam picks up the ball.
Oh, he's hit!

31:27.052 --> 31:28.845
He fumbles.
He fumbles the ball.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.806
Brant picks it up.
Oh, no!

31:30.847 --> 31:33.850
He is gonna go.
He's got the outside.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.727
And he's got
a posse goin' in.

31:35.769 --> 31:38.188
Touchdown!
Oh, my!

31:38.230 --> 31:40.190
Touchdown, Vikings.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.693
And the Panthers just get
whacked right out of the gate.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.821
Holy smokes.
Sneaky, sneaky.

31:45.862 --> 31:46.863
[yelling, booing]

31:46.905 --> 31:48.907
Brant lines up
for the extra point.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.826
There's the snap.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.327
Oh, it's a fake.
He rolls right.

31:52.369 --> 31:54.663
He's got‐‐
It's in the end zone.

31:54.704 --> 31:55.914
Two points!
And bam!

31:55.956 --> 31:59.751
The Vikings up eight‐nothing.
Two trick plays.

31:59.793 --> 32:02.754
The gauntlet has
definitely been thrown down.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.090
This should be
one hell of a brawl.
[thunder]

32:05.132 --> 32:08.051
Oh, my, folks.
It is raining in Texas.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.928
And Coach Taylor's
field of dreams

32:09.928 --> 32:11.930
may have just become
a nightmare.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.348
[engine won't turn]

32:13.390 --> 32:14.766
You gotta be kidding me.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.893
Don't‐‐don't do this
to me right now.

32:16.935 --> 32:17.769
[engine stalling]

32:17.769 --> 32:20.063
Tonight, you're gonna
do this to me.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.940
Okay.

32:27.904 --> 32:30.323
Well, that's fun.
Thank you!

32:33.451 --> 32:35.245
(announcer)
...slips, and he goes down

32:35.287 --> 32:37.164
after a three‐yard pickup,

32:37.205 --> 32:40.125
and another four are
sliding through the mud.

32:40.167 --> 32:41.793
I'll tell you, folks,
these people are...

32:41.793 --> 32:43.795
(man)
Why aren't you
at the game?

32:43.795 --> 32:44.880
Got an algebra exam
next week.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.632
Semifinals or no semifinals,
you know what I'm sayin'?

32:47.674 --> 32:49.885
I remember
those days.
Yeah.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.304
(Albright)
Under four minutes left to go
in the half, folks.

32:52.345 --> 32:55.724
The storm is here, and it is
a real Texas toad strangler.

32:55.765 --> 32:58.310
Our boys have been bogged down
the entire half.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.270
It's second in 14
from our own 40.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.814
Saracen hands it to Riggins
off the left side.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.316
Oh, he's hit hard, fumbles.

33:04.316 --> 33:06.401
[overlapping shouting]

33:06.443 --> 33:07.903
There's a scramble.
Panthers are going for it.

33:07.944 --> 33:10.113
The Vikings have it.
No!

33:10.155 --> 33:13.825
Oh, no! The ball is out of
bounds at the 30 yard line.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.952
And Coach Taylor
and the Panthers

33:15.994 --> 33:18.038
just dodged a muddy bullet
there, folks.

33:18.079 --> 33:22.125
[shouting]

33:22.167 --> 33:24.294
48, 10, hut!

33:31.009 --> 33:33.178
(Albright)
The ball is tipped!

33:33.178 --> 33:34.221
Oh, no! Interception!

33:34.262 --> 33:37.015
Interception!
Vikings have the ball.

33:37.057 --> 33:39.017
Things have just gone
from bad to worse.

33:39.059 --> 33:40.060
What are you doing?

33:40.101 --> 33:41.853
You can't hold that slant
against these guys.

33:41.895 --> 33:44.940
They're too big.
What are you doing, huh?

33:44.981 --> 33:45.732
Get your head together.

33:45.774 --> 33:50.028
Hey, Saracen,
you've got this, okay?

33:50.070 --> 33:51.780
Just remember
what we talked about.

33:51.821 --> 33:52.781
You gotta stay tall.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.032
You gotta
look over the line.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.200
You're sitting back
on your heels.

33:55.242 --> 33:56.785
That's why you're
throwin' 'em short.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.703
Get your head in it, baby.
Let's go, D!

33:58.703 --> 33:59.788
(Stan Zisk)
It's fourth down

33:59.829 --> 34:01.331
and one yard
to go for a first, folks.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.041
And Coach Taylor
is goin' for it

34:03.083 --> 34:04.042
here at the end
of the half.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.836
He needs something.
Down by eight.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.172
Saracen over the ball.
He hands off to Riggins.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.799
He's got the first down.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.218
Oh, he's got more!
Oh, my!

34:13.218 --> 34:15.345
Riggins went down hard.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.055
I think Tim Riggins
thought he was gonna

34:17.055 --> 34:19.724
carry that ball
all the way to Mexico.

34:19.766 --> 34:23.144
We have got ourselves
a mud bowl here, folks.

34:23.186 --> 34:24.980
And this crowd is lovin' it.

34:25.021 --> 34:28.358
And you know what?
So am I!

34:28.400 --> 34:29.901
Under a minute to go
in the half.

34:29.943 --> 34:32.153
Saracen takes the snap.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.905
It's a hand‐off to Williams
up the middle.

34:33.947 --> 34:35.991
No! It's a great play
by Saracen.

34:36.032 --> 34:38.326
He drops back.
He goes up high.

34:38.368 --> 34:41.371
Oh, he lays off a beautiful
pass to Smash Williams.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.081
He's got it now!

34:43.123 --> 34:44.582
He's near mid‐field,
best I can tell!

34:44.624 --> 34:45.375
Put him down!
Somebody put him down!

34:45.417 --> 34:46.543
(Zisk)
Inside the 40!

34:46.584 --> 34:47.836
Looks like he could go!

34:47.877 --> 34:48.837
There you go, baby!

34:48.878 --> 34:49.879
(Zisk)
Smash Williams to the ten.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.256
He gets hit hard.

34:51.298 --> 34:52.507
[whistle blows]

34:52.549 --> 34:53.883
(Zisk)
A touchdown!

34:53.925 --> 34:55.552
Touchdown, Panthers.

34:55.593 --> 34:58.430
And Matt Saracen,
despite the mud and the rain,

34:58.430 --> 34:59.931
has really stepped up

34:59.973 --> 35:02.225
and taken charge of
this Panthers' offense.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.060
Taylor
trying to tie this thing up.

35:04.102 --> 35:07.439
Going for two.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.774
And we have a tie, folks!

35:09.816 --> 35:10.609
Whoo!

35:10.609 --> 35:13.028
(Zisk)
Panthers score!

35:13.069 --> 35:14.571
And Coach Taylor has brought
this game to even

35:14.613 --> 35:15.780
going into the half.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.365
Coaches!
I need coaches!

35:17.407 --> 35:18.950
(Zisk)
The referee is calling
for coaches and the captains.

35:18.992 --> 35:21.077
This could not
be good, folks.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.787
I don't think
we oughta play.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.081
Hey, it'd be a real shame
if they had to call this match.

35:25.123 --> 35:29.419
This is a home field in
the truest sense of the word.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.588
This field was hand‐built
by Coach Taylor

35:31.630 --> 35:34.424
and these players so that
these Dillon fans in this town

35:34.466 --> 35:35.967
could enjoy one last
home game.

35:35.967 --> 35:36.968
(Saracen)
Coach, Coach,

35:36.968 --> 35:38.053
we wanna play.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.181
(Brant Captain)
Yeah, we wanna play too.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.101
(referee)
Okay, you guys wanna play.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.104
In 24 minutes,
somebody's going to State.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.939
You're damn right
we'll play.
Let's do it, Coach.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.816
We're playing?
Let's play.

35:51.858 --> 35:52.859
(Zisk)
Yes! We got
what we wanted,

35:52.901 --> 35:55.070
and we are gonna
play this game out.

35:55.111 --> 35:58.198
Somebody on this field tonight
is going to State.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.253
(man)
What, is he not coming?

36:12.295 --> 36:13.505
Yeah, it looks that way.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.175
Drive safe out there.
It's pourin'.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.428
Thanks.
Appreciate it.

36:20.470 --> 36:23.473
The Dillon Panthers make a big
defensive stop here, folks.

36:23.515 --> 36:26.101
This game is
still tied up at eight.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.185
The Vikings line up
for a field goal.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.145
This could put the game
out of reach.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.188
There's the snap.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.273
The Brant field‐‐oh!
He goes down.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.984
He goes down,
and the kick is no good.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.986
Coach Taylor
is gonna have one more shot

36:37.028 --> 36:38.530
to bring his Panthers back.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.160
Hey.
Forgot your notebook.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.246
Aah!
Do not scream!

36:48.248 --> 36:51.000
Do not scream!

36:51.042 --> 36:52.669
Get in the truck!
Get in the truck!

36:52.711 --> 36:54.295
[Tyra screaming]

36:54.337 --> 36:57.048
You're gonna like this.
Huh? Huh?

36:57.090 --> 36:58.633
You're gonna like this.
No!

36:58.675 --> 37:00.176
You're gonna like this.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.386
I'm gonna take my time
with you.

37:01.428 --> 37:04.055
You wanna scream?
You're gonna like this.

37:04.097 --> 37:07.892
Stop...screaming!

37:07.892 --> 37:11.187
(Taylor)
Everything that has been
asked of you this year

37:11.229 --> 37:13.189
and that you have asked
of yourselves, gentlemen,

37:13.231 --> 37:14.983
comes down to this.

37:15.024 --> 37:15.984
Blood, sweat, and tears,

37:16.025 --> 37:19.571
it all stays right here
on this field right now!

37:19.612 --> 37:21.364
This is our dirt.

37:21.406 --> 37:24.200
This is our mud.
This is ours, baby.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.494
Clear eyes, full hearts,
can't lose!

37:26.536 --> 37:27.537
(team)
Can't lose!

37:27.579 --> 37:28.538
[Tyra screaming]

37:28.580 --> 37:30.540
Stop screaming right now!

37:31.958 --> 37:34.169
Ah, you bitch!

37:35.587 --> 37:37.672
[man grunting]

37:40.258 --> 37:44.220
[man screaming]

37:50.727 --> 37:53.271
Don't let them breathe.
Do not let them breathe.

37:53.313 --> 37:55.440
Take it down the field.
Go get it, baby, go!

37:55.440 --> 37:57.734
[crowd cheering]

37:57.776 --> 37:58.902
(Albright)
Saracen rolls right.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.237
He's got Smash breaking
on the skinny post.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.405
Oh! Smash has the ball!

38:02.447 --> 38:05.575
He breaks to the inside.
He's got some room.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.243
He's to the 40! Oh!

38:07.285 --> 38:09.120
You gotta get
out of bounds, Smash!

38:09.162 --> 38:10.789
Come on, baby, go!

38:10.830 --> 38:12.624
Smash is not gonna
get out of bounds.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.250
Oh, down he goes.
Mercy!

38:14.292 --> 38:17.170
The clock is winding down
on the Panther season.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.135
(Landry)
Tyra, I'm so sorry.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.597
My car wouldn't‐‐
what are you doin' out here?

38:27.639 --> 38:28.598
What are you doin' out here?

38:28.640 --> 38:31.309
[sobbing]
He tried to rape me.

38:31.351 --> 38:33.061
Wait, who? Huh?

38:33.102 --> 38:35.104
[sobbing]

38:37.315 --> 38:39.734
19 seconds left on the clock.
This is it.

38:39.776 --> 38:41.069
Clock's rollin'!

38:41.110 --> 38:42.278
Matt Saracen
bringing his team

38:42.320 --> 38:43.321
to the line of scrimmage.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.240
Saracen trying to set up
for a spike ball

38:45.281 --> 38:46.449
so he can stop the clock.

38:46.491 --> 38:47.492
Very smart.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.160
He's really showing
a lot of poise

38:49.160 --> 38:50.286
here in the clutches.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.663
Go!

38:51.704 --> 38:53.706
Saracen over the ball.

38:53.706 --> 38:56.251
There's the snap.
He's gonna spike it.

38:56.292 --> 38:57.252
Spike the ball!

38:57.293 --> 38:58.169
Let him go, let him go.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.337
Wait a second,
wait a second.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.464
He's keeping the ball.
He's hauling out.

39:01.506 --> 39:03.550
Saracen has the ball!

39:05.218 --> 39:08.513
Oh! He gets a huge block
from Tim Riggins.

39:08.555 --> 39:10.682
Go, go, go, go!

39:14.227 --> 39:15.645
Touchdown!

39:15.687 --> 39:18.356
Touchdown, Dillon Panthers!

39:18.398 --> 39:21.693
And folks, Matt Saracen
has really shined tonight.

39:21.693 --> 39:26.364
He has stepped up
and led these Panthers back.

39:26.406 --> 39:31.369
Our Dillon Panthers
are going to State!

39:31.369 --> 39:33.746
[cheering]

39:53.600 --> 39:54.726
Lord, we just thank you
for the privilege

39:54.767 --> 39:57.145
of playing this game
that we love, Father.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.354
And to play true, God.

39:58.396 --> 40:02.650
Tonight, in spite
of the rain and the cold,

40:02.692 --> 40:06.362
you just allowed us to play
with honor, pride, and heart.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.198
Lord, help us
to press on forward

40:09.240 --> 40:12.076
knowing that no matter what,
our destiny and our future

40:12.076 --> 40:14.078
is secure in your hands, God.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.122
It's in the mighty
and matchless name of Jesus

40:16.122 --> 40:17.540
that we pray, Lord.

40:17.582 --> 40:18.541
Amen.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.542
(players)
Amen.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.002
Here we go!

40:21.044 --> 40:22.712
We're going to State, baby!

40:22.754 --> 40:28.384
[cheering
and overlapping chatter]

40:35.266 --> 40:37.477
I'll always love you,
no matter what happens.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.613
What?
Great game.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.037
Hey, Ma, we're goin'
to State, baby!

40:56.079 --> 40:58.665
We're goin' to State, Ma!

41:00.166 --> 41:01.459
I'll get you wet.

41:01.501 --> 41:02.460
No! Don't!

41:02.502 --> 41:03.336
[laughing]

41:03.378 --> 41:06.464
I will stomp you.
I will stomp you.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.299
Goin' to State!
That we are.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.260
Yeah. Are you sleeping
over again tonight?

41:11.302 --> 41:13.012
Uh...

41:14.472 --> 41:17.266
I know we're goin'
to State.

41:32.281 --> 41:35.034
[crying]

41:37.829 --> 41:40.206
You're gonna be okay.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.044
You'll be all right.

41:50.675 --> 41:53.302
[screaming and laughing]

41:54.345 --> 41:55.680
Whoo hoo!

41:55.680 --> 41:57.181
(McGill)
West Cambria won tonight.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.559
Looks like we got
Voodoo in the final.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.312
Go figure.
Yeah.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.197
Matt Saracen,
he was a‐‐

42:13.197 --> 42:17.785
he was a different
quarterback tonight.

42:17.827 --> 42:20.204
That's a good job.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.247
He's a good kid.

42:21.289 --> 42:22.582
He's a hell
of a quarterback.

42:22.623 --> 42:24.417
That was a good job.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.801
You ever think about
coaching?

42:37.889 --> 43:23.601
