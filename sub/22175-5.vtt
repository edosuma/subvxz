09:12.385 --> 09:13.686
The lines are perfect.
The colors are smooth.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.488
Everything's in there.

09:15.554 --> 09:18.591
<i>Somebody's going home today,</i>
<i>and I know it's not me.</i>

09:18.658 --> 09:20.626
- If I had more
than two hours...

09:23.796 --> 09:25.932
- Grip did
not follow through.

09:25.998 --> 09:28.668
<i>- In the rose,</i>
<i>there was no rhyme or reason</i>

09:28.734 --> 09:30.636
<i>to how the petals were shaded.</i>

09:30.703 --> 09:32.972
<i>It was black shading whipped</i>
<i>out in areas that shouldn't</i>

09:33.039 --> 09:34.607
<i>have been whipped out,</i>
<i>and it didn't give it</i>

09:34.674 --> 09:36.909
any shape or dimension at all.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.978
It looked like he
just freaked out,

09:39.045 --> 09:42.214
<i>and it looks like</i>
<i>just a weird wilted blob.</i>

09:42.281 --> 09:43.749
Obviously, being self-taught,

09:43.816 --> 09:46.385
he hasn't learned
all of those things.

09:46.452 --> 09:50.623
- Looking at Roger's tattoo,
it's a cute design.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.759
<i>There's clean,</i>
<i>very sculpted lines.</i>

09:53.826 --> 09:55.661
<i>There's bold color.</i>

09:55.728 --> 09:58.965
- Personally, I think
that Tim has one up on Roger.

09:59.031 --> 10:00.900
<i>It's pretty to look at.</i>

10:00.967 --> 10:03.235
<i>He definitely thought out</i>
<i>the design and the placement.</i>

10:03.302 --> 10:05.671
<i>It fits the armpit perfectly.</i>
- That's where Roger

10:05.738 --> 10:09.508
runs into an issue
with his ice cream cone.

10:09.575 --> 10:13.245
<i>He has it tilted</i>
<i>at this strange angle.</i>

10:13.312 --> 10:15.581
<i>Now, when she</i>
<i>shows it from the front,</i>

10:15.648 --> 10:18.651
<i>you're not gonna understand</i>
<i>that it's an ice cream cone.</i>

10:18.718 --> 10:20.286
- Exactly.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.754
- Tim also utilized
the entire space, and I think

10:21.821 --> 10:23.589
<i>he really thought about,</i>

10:23.656 --> 10:26.592
<i>"What would make a good</i>
<i>armpit tattoo on this woman?"</i>

10:26.659 --> 10:29.495
- But Tim had
lines that have a couple

10:29.562 --> 10:32.264
<i>little hiccups,</i>
<i>and he had an opportunity</i>

10:32.331 --> 10:34.200
<i>to put a little bit more black</i>

10:34.266 --> 10:37.536
<i>behind the flower in order</i>
<i>to fix a couple of those</i>

10:37.603 --> 10:39.839
little problems,
and he didn't take it.

10:39.905 --> 10:41.607
- How do we judge this?

10:41.674 --> 10:43.476
{\an3}The one that considered
the challenge and the canvas,

10:43.542 --> 10:45.311
{\an3}or someone that showed us
they could put a beautifully

10:45.378 --> 10:48.514
{\an3}executed tattoo completely
in the wrong direction?

10:50.082 --> 10:52.251
- Why you sweating, bro?
- He's nervous.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.586
- I'm sweating
for this ass-whooping y'all are

10:53.652 --> 10:55.287
about to get from the judges.

10:55.354 --> 10:57.056
- I don't think so.
You're gonna get eliminated

10:57.123 --> 10:59.592
today, and tomorrow,
you're gonna get eliminated.

10:59.658 --> 11:00.993
- Well, you know,

11:01.060 --> 11:02.728
I have to agree
with the first half.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.597
Grip,
I think you're going home, bro.

11:06.565 --> 11:07.666
- Sounds like you guys are
making the decision

11:07.733 --> 11:09.168
for us, huh?

11:09.235 --> 11:11.504
{\an1}- Just calling the bull[bleep]
when I see it.

11:11.570 --> 11:17.443
{\an3}- Well, we saw some high highs,
and we saw some low lows.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.745
- Tim,
that flower looked like it

11:19.812 --> 11:22.415
really belonged in the armpit.
- Thank you.

11:22.481 --> 11:24.483
- But there were
some hiccups in your lines.

11:24.550 --> 11:29.055
You also chose tricky colors to
make sure that you have solid.

11:29.889 --> 11:32.191
- Roger,
in terms of technical ability,

11:32.258 --> 11:34.160
<i>your line work was exquisite.</i>

11:34.226 --> 11:36.128
<i>Your saturation was perfect.</i>

11:36.195 --> 11:38.130
<i>- But the placement</i>
<i>was so strange.</i>

11:38.197 --> 11:40.866
You had to kind of turn
your head to make sense of it.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.768
- So we have placement issues?
- Oh, absolutely.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.603
- Wasn't it in the armpit?

11:44.670 --> 11:47.606
- If you're comfortable doing
the bare minimum and saying,

11:47.673 --> 11:50.609
"Well, it's in the armpit,"
then that's on you, man.

11:50.676 --> 11:52.078
- The bare minimum is all I

11:52.144 --> 11:53.546
had to do against
the competitors today.

11:53.612 --> 11:54.780
Why should I be
breaking my back?

11:54.847 --> 11:56.215
- You should break your back

11:56.282 --> 11:59.318
anytime that you're
in a competition.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.353
- Grip, there wasn't
very much rhyme or reason

12:01.420 --> 12:04.223
to why you shaded the rose
the way that you shaded it.

12:04.290 --> 12:07.026
<i>- It was a bit hard</i>
<i>in certain areas to actually</i>

12:07.093 --> 12:09.995
get that shade in how I was
supposed to get the shade in.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.697
- It is difficult to tattoo

12:11.764 --> 12:15.401
an armpit, but that's
what makes it a challenge.

12:17.303 --> 12:22.141

You could have shrunk that.

24:04.843 --> 24:06.845
Totally could have shrunk it,
and you didn't.

24:06.912 --> 24:08.580

the client wanted me to do.

24:08.647 --> 24:10.682
{\an3}- All right, you guys.
Come with me.

24:16.521 --> 24:18.957

24:25.063 --> 24:28.200
of you will be eliminated.

24:28.266 --> 24:31.002

and the fact that I had such

24:31.069 --> 24:33.271
a difficult canvas to tattoo,
and the fact that

24:33.338 --> 24:35.240
it's even close,
it's a little disappointing.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.409
I feel like if he had
such an easy canvas and I had

24:37.475 --> 24:40.145

he should have been much better

24:40.212 --> 24:42.948

I was labeled obese at age

30:05.537 --> 30:07.705

30:07.772 --> 30:10.375
{\an3}that translated over to life,
and I realized that

{\an3}you can't sit back
and wait on your dreams.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.811
You got to go and take them.

30:13.878 --> 30:16.347
I like to talk with kids
that's in middle school.

30:16.414 --> 30:18.082
{\an3}A lot of people have
never had a big brother,

30:18.149 --> 30:20.051
{\an3}never had a father,
and I'm that guy that comes

30:20.118 --> 30:23.054
{\an3}as a mentor and coaches
and motivates and let them know

30:23.121 --> 30:25.490
{\an3}you can achieve greatness,
and here's a perfect example.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.358

30:27.425 --> 30:28.927

love the hair of the lion.

30:38.036 --> 30:39.637
{\an3}The hair kind
of looks like locks.

30:39.704 --> 30:43.608
{\an1}- Would you be willing
to have your lion have locks?

30:43.675 --> 30:44.742
- It would be interesting.
Yeah.

30:44.809 --> 30:46.411

30:46.477 --> 30:48.947

30:49.013 --> 30:52.417
I started a really
amazing queer youth nonprofit,

30:52.483 --> 30:56.554

a lot of queer young kids to

30:56.621 --> 30:58.856

30:58.923 --> 31:01.326

when I look at the lion face,
that's an absolutely beautiful

38:09.720 --> 38:13.391
<i>lion face, and then you move</i>
<i>on to the dreadlock lion mane,</i>

38:13.457 --> 38:15.259
<i>and I just don't</i>
<i>know what happened.</i>

38:15.326 --> 38:18.062
<i>It's like another tattooer</i>
<i>came in and finished it.</i>

38:18.129 --> 38:19.563
- Absolutely.
- It's completely different.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.966
{\an1}- I really think
Gia outshined him today.

38:22.033 --> 38:25.336
- What I love most about
Gia's tattoo was her expert

38:25.403 --> 38:28.806
<i>knowledge of contrast,</i>
<i>of light against dark.</i>

38:28.873 --> 38:31.809
<i>There were a few areas</i>
<i>in the headdress I wish she</i>

38:31.876 --> 38:33.778
would have allowed it
to breathe a little more,

38:33.844 --> 38:37.415
but the face of the tattoo--she
used the black right along

38:37.481 --> 38:40.017
<i>the side of the face</i>
<i>and pushed it inward.</i>

38:40.084 --> 38:41.585
<i>It brings the face up,</i>

38:41.652 --> 38:43.988
<i>and it separates</i>
<i>the face from the skin.</i>

38:44.055 --> 38:45.890
- I can read the facial
expression

38:45.956 --> 38:49.093
<i>from far away.</i>
<i>She looks soft and strong,</i>

38:49.160 --> 38:53.264
and that is exactly what
that woman wanted on her arm.

38:53.330 --> 38:55.166
- She nailed it.

38:57.301 --> 38:59.136
- Okay, you guys
ready to find out who won?

38:59.203 --> 39:01.872
[cheers and applause]

39:01.939 --> 39:05.943
- On the line:
if Tim beats Gia,

39:06.010 --> 39:07.578
he will secure a spot

39:07.645 --> 39:10.214
on "Ink Master" season ten.

39:13.818 --> 39:15.920
- And the vote was split.

39:15.986 --> 39:18.823
[audience oohs]

39:18.889 --> 39:22.026
- Us Angels voted for...

39:24.495 --> 39:25.863
Gia Rose.

39:31.469 --> 39:34.538
- The local artists
voted for...

39:37.641 --> 39:39.543
Tim.

39:41.512 --> 39:46.717
- And, in an incredibly
close decision,

39:46.784 --> 39:51.388
literally by less
than five votes,

39:51.455 --> 39:54.658
you guys, our Atlanta crowd,

39:54.725 --> 39:58.496
voted for...

39:58.562 --> 40:00.331
Tim.

40:00.397 --> 40:01.532
[cheers and applause]

40:01.599 --> 40:04.101
Tim, that means that you have

40:04.168 --> 40:08.239
secured your spot
on "Ink Master" season ten.

40:08.305 --> 40:10.641
[cheers and applause]

40:10.708 --> 40:13.677
- I [bleep] won?
I sweeped everybody.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.846
Wow. This is a dream come true.

40:15.913 --> 40:17.715
I couldn't even
have imagined it.

40:17.782 --> 40:20.985
- Congratulations, dude.

40:21.051 --> 40:22.153
<i>Art's subjective.</i>

40:22.219 --> 40:23.420
As much as it sucks

40:23.487 --> 40:25.222
when you don't win the game,

40:25.289 --> 40:28.526
it's the game,
and even though I lost today,

40:28.592 --> 40:32.196
I gave my canvas something
that means a lot to her,

40:32.263 --> 40:35.299
and that's awesome,
so win or lose, I win.

40:35.366 --> 40:37.868
- Thank you so much, Atlanta.

40:40.704 --> 40:43.240
- [inaudible]

40:43.307 --> 40:44.642
- Being on "Ink Master" is

40:44.708 --> 40:48.145
gonna make my work
that much better.

40:48.212 --> 40:50.714
"Ink Master" season ten,
I'm coming for you.

40:52.817 --> 40:54.218
One more time. Hey.
