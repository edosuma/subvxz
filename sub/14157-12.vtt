ON SINGLE LADIES...

00:04.672 --> 00:05.639
>> WHAT IS GOING ON WITH US?

00:05.639 --> 00:06.640
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.176
>> DO WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO.

00:08.176 --> 00:10.644
DON'T SAY ANYTHING!

00:10.644 --> 00:12.413
>> A LINE DESIGNED BY ME,

00:12.413 --> 00:13.581
INSPIRED BY YOU.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.183
IT'D BE LIKE PRINTING MONEY.

00:15.183 --> 00:16.350
>> DEACON'S DEAD.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.318
>> WHERE WERE YOU THAT NIGHT,

00:17.318 --> 00:18.219
MALCOLM?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.220
>> TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU,

00:19.220 --> 00:20.254
FELICIA'S OUT FOR HERSELF.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.222

00:21.222 --> 00:22.290
SLEEPING WITH ME AND PRETENDING

00:22.290 --> 00:24.525
SHE WANTED A RELATIONSHIP.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.859
>> SURPRISE.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.628
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

00:27.628 --> 00:30.264

01:04.798 --> 01:05.666
* AH, AH

[laughter]

01:06.534 --> 01:07.535
>> WOW.

01:07.535 --> 01:08.702
I MEAN, MY E-MAIL HAS BEEN

01:08.702 --> 01:10.538
BLOWING UP WITH RSVPs FOR THE

01:10.538 --> 01:11.505
ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.473
>> WELL, EVERYBODY LOVES TO

01:12.473 --> 01:13.741
CELEBRATE LOVE.

01:13.741 --> 01:14.708
>> WHO PUT ECSTASY IN YOUR

01:14.708 --> 01:15.709
OATMEAL?

01:15.709 --> 01:16.610
>> NOBODY.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.545
I JUST KNOW IT'S TRUE.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.512
I HAD AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY ONCE,

01:18.512 --> 01:19.413
REMEMBER?

01:19.413 --> 01:20.581
OH, AND A WEDDING.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.482
>> OH. [laughs]

01:21.482 --> 01:22.383
AND A DIVORCE.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.351
>> OOH, LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT

01:23.351 --> 01:24.252
DIVORCE.

01:24.252 --> 01:24.918
THIS IS A HAPPY TIME.

01:24.918 --> 01:25.786
>> YEAH.

01:25.786 --> 01:26.687
>> OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:26.687 --> 01:27.588
MARRIAGE.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.490
WAKING UP WITH THE SAME PIECE

01:29.490 --> 01:31.325
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.661
POSSIBILITY OR COMPLETE FICTION?

01:33.661 --> 01:34.895
>> NO COMMENT.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.530
>> AS I SUSPECTED.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.466
>> OH, WELL, WE KNOW I BELIEVE

01:38.466 --> 01:39.467
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.235
>> ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.370
OUT OF THE FOUR OF US, KEISHA

01:42.370 --> 01:43.537
WAS THE LAST ONE I EXPECTED TO

01:43.537 --> 01:44.638
GO MARCHING DOWN THE AISLE IN

01:44.638 --> 01:45.606
ALL WHITE.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.574
COME TO THINK OF IT, I DON'T

01:46.574 --> 01:47.575
THINK ANY OF US CAN WEAR ALL

01:47.575 --> 01:48.542
WHITE.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.643
>> NO, A BRIDE CAN WEAR

01:49.643 --> 01:50.911
WHATEVER COLOR SHE WANTS.

01:50.911 --> 01:51.879
>> IF FELICIA GETS REMARRIED,

01:51.879 --> 01:53.381
I'LL BE DESIGNING AN ALL-BLACK

01:53.381 --> 01:54.348
WEDDING DRESS.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.316
>> IF FELICIA GETS REMARRIED,

01:55.316 --> 01:56.484
IT'LL BE ONE OF THE SEVEN SIGNS

01:56.484 --> 01:58.452
OF THE APOCALYPSE, AND NO ONE IS

01:58.452 --> 01:59.653
GONNA NEED A WEDDING DRESS.

01:59.653 --> 02:00.654
>> I KNOW, RIGHT?

02:00.654 --> 02:01.689
AFTER HER EX, SHE PROBABLY

02:01.689 --> 02:02.656
NEVER, EVER WANTS TO GET

02:02.656 --> 02:03.524
MARRIED.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.725
I MEAN, IT IS TOUGH OUT THERE.

02:04.725 --> 02:05.693
>> TELL ME ABOUT IT.

02:05.693 --> 02:06.794
>> OH, SHE CAN.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.662
DID YOU WITNESS THAT APOCALYPSE

02:08.662 --> 02:09.563
THAT WAS HER AND TERRENCE THE

02:09.563 --> 02:10.531
OTHER NIGHT?

02:10.531 --> 02:11.599
>> WHOA, AN "APOCALYPSE" MEANS

02:11.599 --> 02:12.500
THE END OF THE WORLD, OKAY?

02:12.500 --> 02:13.967
TERRENCE AND I NOT WORKING OUT

02:13.967 --> 02:17.371
IS HARDLY THE END OF THE WORLD.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.539
>> HMM.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.607
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HIM?

02:19.607 --> 02:21.742
>> NO, BUT I DO HAVE TO SEE HIM

02:21.742 --> 02:23.076
LATER FOR SOME BUSINESS WE NEED

02:23.076 --> 02:24.978
TO HANDLE...WHICH IS WHAT WE

02:24.978 --> 02:25.979
SHOULD'VE KEPT OUR RELATIONSHIP

02:25.979 --> 02:27.615
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:27.615 --> 02:30.083
>> [whispering] "BUSINESS."

02:30.083 --> 02:30.951
>> HOO, HOO!

02:30.951 --> 02:31.819
>> COME ON.

02:31.819 --> 02:32.686
>> OOH, HOO, HOO!

02:32.686 --> 02:33.487
>> COME ON, MAN.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.522
I'M GETTIN' TIRED OF WATCHING

02:34.522 --> 02:35.389
YOU, LESS TALKING.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.257
NO SHOOTING, JUST TALK.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.491
[grunts] COME ON, MAN.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.626
NICE TRY.

02:38.626 --> 02:39.527
>> LOOK.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.428
>> WHAT?

02:40.428 --> 02:41.495
>> I'M JUST LETTIN' YOU HAVE A

02:41.495 --> 02:42.430
LITTLE BIT OF FUN BEFORE YOU GET

02:42.430 --> 02:43.331
MARRIED.

02:43.331 --> 02:44.031
>> OH, WHAT YOU THINK, ALL THE

02:44.031 --> 02:45.399
FUN STOPS AFTER YOU GET MARRIED?

02:45.399 --> 02:46.500
>> IT DIDN'T STOP FOR POPS.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.701
>> NO, IT SURE DIDN'T.

02:47.701 --> 02:48.669
THROUGH THE LEGS!

02:48.669 --> 02:49.703
OH! OLD-SCHOOL.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.038
>> OH, YEAH.

02:51.038 --> 02:51.905
>> ALL RIGHT.

02:51.905 --> 02:52.773
BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

02:52.773 --> 02:53.774
IT DON'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY IF

02:53.774 --> 02:55.008
YOU FIND THE RIGHT WOMAN.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.777
>> YEAH, AND JUDGING BY THE SIZE

02:56.777 --> 02:57.645
OF THE RING THAT YOU BOUGHT

02:57.645 --> 02:59.680
KEISHA, SHE THE RIGHT WOMAN.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.981
>> [laughs]

03:00.981 --> 03:03.784
HELL YEAH, SHE IS.

03:03.784 --> 03:04.652
COME ON.

03:04.652 --> 03:05.986
YOU BETTER MAKE IT SEXY.

03:05.986 --> 03:09.122
MAKE IT SEXY, MAKE IT SEXY!

03:09.122 --> 03:10.123
>> TO BE YOUNG.

03:10.123 --> 03:11.024
>> I PULLED A GROIN MUSCLE.

03:11.024 --> 03:11.892
>> YEAH.

03:11.892 --> 03:12.926
>> THAT'S ALL--THAT'S ALL THAT

03:12.926 --> 03:13.794
WAS.

03:13.794 --> 03:14.695
>> GOOD EXCUSE.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.464
>> OKAY, WHAT ABOUT RAQUEL?

03:16.464 --> 03:18.131
>> WHAT ABOUT HER?

03:18.131 --> 03:19.667
>> COME ON, MAN, WHAT HAPPENED?

03:19.667 --> 03:20.601
[laughs]

03:20.601 --> 03:21.569
>> LOOK, MAN, IT JUST DIDN'T

03:21.569 --> 03:22.536
WORK.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.471
>> [sighs]

03:23.471 --> 03:24.738
LOOK, T, SOME OF THESE WOMEN

03:24.738 --> 03:26.540
ARE WORK, OKAY?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.742
AGONIZING, BACK-BREAKING,

03:28.742 --> 03:30.778
BONE-CRUSHING WORK, YEAH.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.080
BUT IT'S ALL WORTH IT IF YOU

03:33.080 --> 03:34.915
FIND THE RIGHT ONE.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.985
IT REALLY IS.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.019
SLEEP.

03:39.019 --> 03:39.920
YOU ASLEEP.

03:39.920 --> 03:40.921
>> I'M TRYING TO LISTEN.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.055
>> HERE I AM, TRYING TO TALK TO

03:42.055 --> 03:42.990
YOU ABOUT WOMEN, AND YOU LIKE,

03:42.990 --> 03:44.024
"NUH-NUH-NUH-NUH," ALL UP HERE.

03:44.024 --> 03:44.958
COME ON.

03:44.958 --> 03:45.826
>> [laughs] HEY, LOOK.

03:45.826 --> 03:46.794
AT LEAST IT'S GOING GOOD WITH

03:46.794 --> 03:47.661
CUT.

03:47.661 --> 03:48.562
WE GOT AN INVESTOR, MAN.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.597
WE CAN RAMP UP PRODUCTION.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.098
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

03:51.098 --> 03:52.065
HOW COME YOU JUST NOW TELLING ME

03:52.065 --> 03:54.101
THIS, MAN?

03:54.101 --> 03:55.503
>> I DIDN'T THINK YOU CARED

03:55.503 --> 03:57.671
ABOUT CUT.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.574
>> YEAH, I...

04:00.574 --> 04:02.175
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, MAN.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.645
I...SHOULD'VE BEEN A LOT MORE

04:04.645 --> 04:06.547
SUPPORTIVE THAN I WAS.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.781
BUT YOU GOT IT, AND I'M PROUD OF

04:07.781 --> 04:09.149
YOU.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.050
I'M REAL PROUD OF YOU, SO

04:10.050 --> 04:12.085
CONGRATULATIONS.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.153
>> THANKS, MAN.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.087
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU TOO.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.055
>> THANKS.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.023
>> HA! SUCKER.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.057
>> AWW.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.526
[laughter]

04:18.526 --> 04:19.527
OKAY.

04:19.527 --> 04:20.193
>> BEST TWO OUT OF THREE?

04:20.193 --> 04:21.061
>> ALL RIGHT.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.763
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.598
>> THANK YOU FOR HELPING, OMAR.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.066
YOU'VE GOT SUCH AN EYE.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.501
>> I'M ALWAYS GLAD TO HELP.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.769
AND I AM LOVING THESE NEW

04:28.769 --> 04:29.703
PIECES.

04:29.703 --> 04:30.638
>> THANK YOU!

04:30.638 --> 04:31.805
YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE MEETINGS

04:31.805 --> 04:32.806
AFTER GLAMWALK ACTUALLY PAID

04:32.806 --> 04:33.941
OFF.

04:33.941 --> 04:34.875
TERRENCE AND I ARE CLOSING A

04:34.875 --> 04:37.044
DEAL WITH AN INVESTOR TODAY.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.946
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

04:38.946 --> 04:39.813
>> I DON'T KNOW.

04:39.813 --> 04:40.714
I DIDN'T WANT TO JINX IT.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.949
ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S, LIKE, THE

04:41.949 --> 04:43.016
ONLY THING THAT'S GOING RIGHT IN

04:43.016 --> 04:44.084
MY LIFE RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.919
>> RAQUEL, COME ON, YOU KNOW

04:45.919 --> 04:46.954
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.021
>> IT ISN'T?

04:48.021 --> 04:50.023
HMM, LET'S SEE.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.892
FIRST, I GET KIDNAPPED BY A MAN

04:51.892 --> 04:53.894
WHO'S NOW DEAD UNDER MYSTERIOUS

04:53.894 --> 04:55.529
CIRCUMSTANCES, EVERY

04:55.529 --> 04:56.730
RELATIONSHIP THAT I'VE BEEN IN

04:56.730 --> 04:59.433
HAS BLOWN UP IN MY FACE, AND I

04:59.433 --> 05:00.734
STILL CAN'T FIND AN INVESTOR FOR

05:00.734 --> 05:02.102
THE STORE, WHICH I NEEDED, LIKE,

05:02.102 --> 05:04.237
HMM, YESTERDAY.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.639
MM-HMM.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.007
>> HMM.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.743
WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE IN JINXES,

05:09.743 --> 05:11.244
SO I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT I'VE

05:11.244 --> 05:12.580
BEEN WORKIN' ON.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.148
I PITCHED FELICIA ON THE IDEA OF

05:15.148 --> 05:16.517
LETTING ME DESIGN A LINE

05:16.517 --> 05:17.618
INSPIRED BY HER.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.619
>> NICE.

05:18.619 --> 05:19.620
>> OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S A MARKET

05:19.620 --> 05:20.588
FOR IT.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.590
SOMEONE HAS BEEN RIPPING ME OFF!

05:22.590 --> 05:23.624
>> [exhales gently]

05:23.624 --> 05:24.792
>> [breathes]

05:24.792 --> 05:26.727
AND I WAS THINKIN', WHAT IF I

05:26.727 --> 05:27.728
BROUGHT YOU IN TO SWEETEN THE

05:27.728 --> 05:28.662
DEAL?

05:28.662 --> 05:29.597
WE COULD CARRY THE LINE

05:29.597 --> 05:31.164
EXCLUSIVELY HERE AT INDULGENCE,

05:31.164 --> 05:33.967
AND WE GET FELICIA TO INVEST.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.669
SHE'S A HUGE FAN OF THE STORE,

05:35.669 --> 05:36.570
AND SHE'S A KILLER

05:36.570 --> 05:39.673
BUSINESSWOMAN.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.009
>> YEAH, IT'S THE "KILLER" PART

05:42.009 --> 05:44.945
I WORRY ABOUT.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.213
>> IN THE PAST 48 HOURS, I'VE

05:46.213 --> 05:48.015
MANAGED TO LOCK DOWN EVERY P.M.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.182
CLIENT THAT MEANS ANYTHING,

05:49.182 --> 05:50.551
EXCEPT FOR ONE.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.485
>> SERGIO.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.488
HE'S OFF THE GRID.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.956
WELL, HE TOOK A BREAK FROM THAT

05:55.956 --> 05:57.024
TOUR, AND HE WENT TO ONE OF

05:57.024 --> 05:58.091
THOSE DESERT RETREATS WHERE YOU

05:58.091 --> 05:59.059
CAN'T HAVE COMPUTERS,

05:59.059 --> 06:00.127
TELEVISIONS, PHONES, OR FUN,

06:00.127 --> 06:01.562
APPARENTLY.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.630
>> WELL, SINCE YOU AND DAVID

06:02.630 --> 06:04.031
SHARED HIM, THERE'S A CHANCE HE

06:04.031 --> 06:05.098
COULD GO WITH HIM.

06:05.098 --> 06:05.999
>> WHAT?

06:05.999 --> 06:06.867
I THOUGHT YOU SAID DAVID

06:06.867 --> 06:07.768
COULDN'T WORK IN MUSIC

06:07.768 --> 06:08.636
MANAGEMENT BECAUSE OF THAT

06:08.636 --> 06:09.603
NON-COMPETITIVE CLAUSE.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.704
>> WELL, HE CAN'T, BUT THE

06:10.704 --> 06:11.739
LITTLE SNAKE IS TRYING TO GET

06:11.739 --> 06:13.040
ALL OF MY CLIENTS TO SIGN WITH

06:13.040 --> 06:15.042
HIS BUDDY OVER AT L.O.V., AND I

06:15.042 --> 06:16.176
GUARANTEE YOU HE IS GOING AFTER

06:16.176 --> 06:17.277
SERGIO.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.012
>> WELL, HE'S NOT GONNA GET HIM.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.548
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:20.548 --> 06:21.782
BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING ON A

06:21.782 --> 06:23.316
PLANE RIGHT NOW TO MAKE SURE

06:23.316 --> 06:24.718
THAT HE DOESN'T.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.721
>> UH, LIKE, RIGHT NOW RIGHT

06:27.721 --> 06:29.022
NOW?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.323
>> IS THERE A PROBLEM?

06:30.323 --> 06:33.160
>> UM, NO.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.161
YES.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.729
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S, UM,

06:35.729 --> 06:36.964
KEISHA'S ENGAGEMENT PARTY

06:36.964 --> 06:38.098
TOMORROW NIGHT, AND I--FELICIA,

06:38.098 --> 06:39.533
I REALLY--I CAN'T MISS IT.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.701
>> AND WE CAN'T MISS OUT ON

06:40.701 --> 06:44.171
SERGIO.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.639
>> RIGHT.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.707
THAT IS VERY TRUE.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.510
UM...

06:49.510 --> 06:50.177
OKAY, CAN I AT LEAST TAKE A

06:50.177 --> 06:51.178
PLANE OUT TOMORROW NIGHT, SO I

06:51.178 --> 06:52.079
CAN RAISE A GLASS WITH KEISHA

06:52.079 --> 06:52.946
TONIGHT?

06:52.946 --> 06:53.847
>> FINE.

06:53.847 --> 06:54.848
>> [sighs]

06:54.848 --> 06:55.783
>> BUT DON'T RAISE TOO MANY

06:55.783 --> 06:56.650
GLASSES.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.285
YOU MISS THAT FLIGHT, I'LL KICK

06:58.285 --> 07:00.020
YOUR ASS SO HARD, YOU WON'T NEED

07:00.020 --> 07:05.025
A PLANE TO FLY OUT THERE.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.326
GET OUT.

07:06.326 --> 07:09.029
>> THANKS.

07:13.601 --> 07:14.935
>> I'VE MARKED WHERE I NEED

07:14.935 --> 07:16.770
SIGNATURES, AND DON'T FORGET TO

07:16.770 --> 07:19.673
DATE THEM.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.709
SO ANY BIG CELEBRATION PLANS?

07:21.709 --> 07:23.143
IT'S A FANTASTIC DEAL.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.046
>> NO, UM, NOT AT ALL.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.081
>> WELL, I'LL HAVE MY OFFICE

07:28.081 --> 07:29.817
SEND YOU THE FINAL EXECUTED

07:29.817 --> 07:30.818
COPIES.

07:30.818 --> 07:31.752
>> THANK YOU.

07:31.752 --> 07:32.686
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

07:32.686 --> 07:33.554
>> THANK YOU.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.321
>> HAVE A GOOD DAY.

07:34.321 --> 07:39.026
>> YOU TOO.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.764
>> SO I WAS THINKING THAT WE

07:43.764 --> 07:45.699
SHOULD RUN THE BUSINESS BY PHONE

07:45.699 --> 07:46.700
CALLS AND E-MAIL FOR A LITTLE

07:46.700 --> 07:47.701
WHILE.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.836
I JUST--I NEED TO PUT AS MUCH

07:48.836 --> 07:50.003
FOCUS INTO INDULGENCE AS I HAVE

07:50.003 --> 07:51.004
CUT.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.640
>> YEAH, I'M--YEAH, I GOT YOU.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.774
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE

07:53.774 --> 07:54.708
THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.676
GOT SOMETHING I CAN'T GET OUT

07:55.676 --> 07:56.343
OF.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.210
>> YEAH, SURE.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.145
I--WHATEVER YOU GOT TO DO.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.682
I MEAN--

08:08.121 --> 08:10.357
[sighs]

08:14.261 --> 08:16.029
>> * WHAT YOU DO FOR ME

08:16.029 --> 08:18.098
* I'LL DO FOR YOU *

08:18.098 --> 08:19.232
>> I'VE DECIDED I WANT A

08:19.232 --> 08:20.333
THREE-WAY WITH YOU AND RAQUEL.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.301
>> [scoffs]

08:21.301 --> 08:22.903
WHAT? NO.

08:22.903 --> 08:23.937
>> NOT THAT KIND OF THREE-WAY,

08:23.937 --> 08:24.872
FELICIA.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.039
GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTTER.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.107
GRANTED, IT WOULD BE THE BEST

08:27.107 --> 08:28.141
NIGHT OF YOUR LIVES.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.342
>> ENOUGH!

08:29.342 --> 08:30.811
>> I THINK THE THREE OF US

08:30.811 --> 08:32.079
SHOULD GO IN BUSINESS TOGETHER.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.081
RAQUEL ALREADY RAN THE NUMBERS,

08:34.081 --> 08:35.783
WITH THAT IVY LEAGUE MBA OF

08:35.783 --> 08:37.818
HERS, FOR ME TO DESIGN A LINE

08:37.818 --> 08:39.319
INSPIRED BY YOU, CARRIED

08:39.319 --> 08:42.222
EXCLUSIVELY AT INDULGENCE, WITH

08:42.222 --> 08:43.924
YOU AS PART OWNER.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.058
>> PART OWNER?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.059
>> RAQUEL'S STILL LOOKING FOR AN

08:46.059 --> 08:47.027
INVESTOR.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.195
EVE HAD TO DROP OUT BECAUSE--

08:48.195 --> 08:49.797
>> YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.098
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MUSIC ARE

08:51.098 --> 08:52.232
MOVING OVER TO FASHION.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.233
>> AND THEY'RE NOT ALL

08:53.233 --> 08:54.201
SUCCESSFUL.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.102
>> LOOK AT VICTORIA BECKHAM.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.470
HER LINE SOLD OUT IN MINUTES.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.839
AND YOU MAKE POSH LOOK LIKE

08:58.839 --> 09:00.307
"PISH."

09:00.307 --> 09:03.210
FELICIA, THIS IS A BIG DEAL

09:03.210 --> 09:04.411
FOR ME.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.979
I FINALLY HAVE THE CONNECTIONS,

09:05.979 --> 09:07.114
THE EXPERIENCE, AND MORE

09:07.114 --> 09:09.416
IMPORTANTLY, THE CONFIDENCE.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.884
AND NONE OF THAT HAPPENED UNTIL

09:10.884 --> 09:12.085
I MET YOU.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.854
I WATCHED MY DESIGNS GO FROM

09:13.854 --> 09:16.056
EXISTING ON PAPER TO BEING WORN

09:16.056 --> 09:17.224
BY ONE OF THE FIERCEST, MOST

09:17.224 --> 09:18.325
EXCITING WOMEN I HAVE EVER MET

09:18.325 --> 09:19.292
IN MY LIFE.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.294
I'M NOT BLOWING SMOKE.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.464
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.466
>> OKAY, FINE.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.467
I GUESS IT WON'T HURT TO TAKE A

09:27.467 --> 09:29.970
MEETING.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.005
HAVE MY ASSISTANT SET IT UP.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.240
>> ALREADY DID.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.209
WE HAVE A MEETING AT 3:00 TODAY.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.912
>> [mouthing words]

09:40.948 --> 09:42.082
>> HEY, BABE, I GOT SOMETHING

09:42.082 --> 09:43.083
HERE FOR YOU.

09:43.083 --> 09:43.984
>> ANOTHER PRESENT?

09:43.984 --> 09:44.952
IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO TOP THE

09:44.952 --> 09:45.953
LAST ONE.

09:45.953 --> 09:46.954
AND IF THAT'S A PRENUP, THIS

09:46.954 --> 09:48.255
WILL BE THE SHORTEST ENGAGEMENT

09:48.255 --> 09:49.489
IN THE HISTORY OF ALL TIME.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.324
>> THEY'RE MENUS FROM RAQUEL,

09:51.324 --> 09:52.259
OKAY?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.126
>> OH.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.127
>> I MEAN, SHE'S GOING ALL OUT

09:54.127 --> 09:54.995
FOR THIS PARTY.

09:54.995 --> 09:55.863
>> MM-HMM.

09:55.863 --> 09:56.664
>> BUT JUST REMEMBER, I'M IN

09:56.664 --> 09:57.464
CHARGE OF THIS WEDDING, ALL

09:57.464 --> 09:58.331
RIGHT?

09:58.331 --> 09:59.199
I'M IN CHARGE.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.133
AND BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR, YOU

10:00.133 --> 10:01.034
AND I ARE GONNA BE HAVING THE

10:01.034 --> 10:02.002
WEDDING OF THE CENTURY, I'M

10:02.002 --> 10:02.870
TELLING YOU.

10:02.870 --> 10:03.771
>> OKAY, WELL, I'VE HEARD OF

10:03.771 --> 10:04.772
"BRIDEZILLA," BUT HERE COMES

10:04.772 --> 10:05.438
"GROOMZILLA."

10:05.438 --> 10:06.306
>> MM.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.174
>> MWAH.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.208
>> I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S

10:08.208 --> 10:09.176
AMAZING.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.144
>> IT WILL BE.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.780
OH, UM, I ALMOST FORGOT, LUKE

10:12.780 --> 10:13.947
CALLED.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.182
>> HE DID?

10:15.182 --> 10:16.183
>> I TOLD HIM THE GOOD NEWS, AND

10:16.183 --> 10:17.317
I INVITED HIM TO THE PARTY.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.052
>> GREAT. THE MORE THE MERRIER.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.053
>> AND HE TOLD ME TO TELL YOU

10:20.053 --> 10:22.890
THAT YOU HIT THE JACKPOT.

10:22.890 --> 10:24.191
>> BABY, YOU DO REALIZE THAT

10:24.191 --> 10:25.793
EVERY SINGLE MAN IN ATLANTA'S

10:25.793 --> 10:26.860
GONNA BE JEALOUS NOW THAT YOU'RE

10:26.860 --> 10:27.995
ENGAGED, RIGHT?

10:27.995 --> 10:29.229
>> OH, MALCOLM, PLEASE.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.330
NOT JUST ATLANTA.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.965
[laughter]

10:31.965 --> 10:33.867
>> I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.135
>> [sighs]

10:35.135 --> 10:36.369
[door closes]

10:36.369 --> 10:37.905
>> I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO ANALYZE

10:37.905 --> 10:39.139
THE NUMBERS YET, BUT I DO

10:39.139 --> 10:40.073
APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT IT

10:40.073 --> 10:41.108
TOOK.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.409
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY

10:42.409 --> 10:43.977
YOU'RE AN INDISPENSIBLE FACTOR

10:43.977 --> 10:45.078
IN THIS EQUATION.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.179
>> I DON'T CLAIM TO BE

10:46.179 --> 10:47.180
INDISPENSIBLE.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.016
BUT I DO KNOW A LOT ABOUT

10:49.016 --> 10:50.350
RETAIL, AND RECENTLY LAUNCHED A

10:50.350 --> 10:52.352
VERY SUCCESSFUL LINE OF JEWELRY.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.353
>> I LAUNCHED A

10:53.353 --> 10:56.089
MULTI-MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS

10:56.089 --> 10:57.390
ON MY OWN.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.092
>> UNDERSTOOD.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.460
AND PRIOR TO OWNING INDULGENCE,

11:00.460 --> 11:02.429
I SPENT SEVERAL YEARS ADVISING

11:02.429 --> 11:03.831
PEOPLE HOW TO MAINTAIN AND RUN

11:03.831 --> 11:05.098
THEIR MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR

11:05.098 --> 11:07.267
COMPANIES.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.369
LOOK, FELICIA, IF IT WAS JUST

11:09.369 --> 11:11.004
ABOUT MAKING MONEY, I WOULD'VE

11:11.004 --> 11:12.605
STAYED IN FINANCE.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.908
WHAT I LIKE TO DO IS TURN

11:14.908 --> 11:16.176
PASSION INTO PROFIT.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.845
>> WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I DO IN

11:17.845 --> 11:20.613
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.984
>> OKAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.252
YOU'RE BOTH ALREADY EXTREMELY

11:25.252 --> 11:26.386
SUCCESSFUL.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.255
TEAMING UP IS ONLY GONNA MAKE

11:28.255 --> 11:29.990
YOU EVEN MORE SUCCESSFUL.

11:29.990 --> 11:30.891
>> NOT NECESSARILY.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.926
>> THERE'S ALWAYS A RISK.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.394
>> WELL, I'M NOT GIVING UP, SO

11:34.394 --> 11:36.296
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A STEP BACK,

11:36.296 --> 11:38.098
GIVE IT A MINUTE TO PERCOLATE,

11:38.098 --> 11:39.166
AND THEN I'M COMIN' RIGHT BACK

11:39.166 --> 11:40.067
AT BOTH OF Y'ALL.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.034
YOU AIN'T SHAKIN' ME.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.371
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

11:44.371 --> 11:45.873
>> * LISTEN CLOSE

11:45.873 --> 11:47.140
* 'CAUSE I'M 'BOUT TO... *

11:47.140 --> 11:48.308
>> OH, MY GOD.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.442
GIRL, THAT IS A PIECE OF REAL

11:49.442 --> 11:50.443
ESTATE RIGHT THERE.

11:50.443 --> 11:51.411
>> YES!

11:51.411 --> 11:52.412
>> [laughs]

11:52.412 --> 11:53.446
>> DAMN RIGHT.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.414
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I BROUGHT A

11:54.414 --> 11:55.415
LITTLE SOMETHING FOR A PRIVATE

11:55.415 --> 11:56.283
TOAST.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.250
KEISHA, I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO

11:57.250 --> 11:58.185
TRY THIS OUT FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT

11:58.185 --> 11:59.119
PARTY.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.220
>> OH, AND I'M SO SORRY THAT I'M

12:00.220 --> 12:01.354
MISSING IT.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.289
>> MM-HMM.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.891
I KNOW, BUT THAT'S OKAY.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.025
JUST DON'T MISS THE WEDDING,

12:05.025 --> 12:06.393
BECAUSE YOU TWO ARE MY

12:06.393 --> 12:07.327
BRIDESMAIDS.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.295
[both gasping]

12:08.295 --> 12:09.229
>> I CAN'T WAIT.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.363
[laughter]

12:10.363 --> 12:11.331
>> GOOD.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.033
>> ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT DO WE HAVE

12:13.033 --> 12:14.301
HERE?

12:14.301 --> 12:15.235
>> SO THIS IS CALLED "TRUE

12:15.235 --> 12:16.103
TEMPTATION."

12:16.103 --> 12:19.006
FIRST, SOME SMIRNOFF WILD HONEY

12:19.006 --> 12:22.910
VODKA, SOME FRESH LEMONADE, ADD

12:22.910 --> 12:25.078
SOME CLUB SODA.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.647
YOU TOP IT OFF WITH A FRESH

12:27.647 --> 12:32.252
SLICE OF LEMON.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.653
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:33.653 --> 12:35.022
>> both: MMM.

12:35.022 --> 12:36.389
>> I LOVE IT.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.424
OOH, AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF THEY

12:37.424 --> 12:38.658
DIDN'T NAME IT AFTER ME.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.293
[laughter]

12:40.293 --> 12:41.261
>> I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

12:41.261 --> 12:42.329
SMIRNOFF FOR THIS CUT PARTY

12:42.329 --> 12:43.330
WE'RE PLANNING, AND I JUST

12:43.330 --> 12:44.264
THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE THE

12:44.264 --> 12:45.132
PERFECT COCKTAIL FOR YOUR

12:45.132 --> 12:46.166
ENGAGEMENT PARTY,

12:46.166 --> 12:48.201
ESPECIALLY SINCE MALCOLM HAS

12:48.201 --> 12:49.937
FINALLY TEMPTED OUR FAVORITE

12:49.937 --> 12:50.938
WILD HONEY.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.640
[laughter]

12:53.640 --> 12:55.142
>> WELL, IT IS PERFECT.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.444
>> OKAY, SO HOW DOES IT FEEL TO

12:57.444 --> 12:58.378
BE GETTING MARRIED?

12:58.378 --> 13:00.247
>> UH, GOOD.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.115
A LITTLE SURPRISING.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.350
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I VALUED MY

13:03.350 --> 13:04.317
INDEPENDENCE A LITTLE TOO MUCH

13:04.317 --> 13:05.252
TO GET MARRIED.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.353
>> SO WHAT CHANGED?

13:06.353 --> 13:07.287
>> MALCOLM NEVER THREATENED MY

13:07.287 --> 13:08.288
INDEPENDENCE.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.622
IN FACT, HE SAID THAT'S WHAT

13:09.622 --> 13:11.658
ATTRACTED HIM TO ME, HUH?

13:11.658 --> 13:13.260
>> RIGHT, AMONGST OTHER THINGS,

13:13.260 --> 13:14.261
I'M SURE.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.228
>> MANY OTHER THINGS.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.229
[laughs]

13:16.229 --> 13:17.364
>> OH, YOU SHOULD WRITE A BOOK

13:17.364 --> 13:18.398
ABOUT ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.632
[laughter]

13:19.632 --> 13:21.234
>> WHY? ARE YOU LOOKING TO GET

13:21.234 --> 13:22.102
REMARRIED?

13:22.102 --> 13:23.136
>> WHAT? NO.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.137
NOT ANYTIME SOON, NO.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.138
BUT I WOULDN'T MIND ONE OF

13:25.138 --> 13:26.106
THOSE.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.107
>> MM-HMM.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.075
>> GIRL, FORGET THE RING.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.042
I JUST WANT TO STOP CHOOSING THE

13:29.042 --> 13:29.977
WRONG MEN.

13:29.977 --> 13:30.677
>> HOT MEN AND HUGE RINGS ARE

13:30.677 --> 13:32.279
NICE, BUT MANY WAYS TO

13:32.279 --> 13:33.313
HAPPINESS, LADIES.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.448
SO HERE'S TO GETTING YOUR OWN...

13:35.448 --> 13:36.749
>> MM-HMM.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.051
>> ON YOUR OWN TERMS.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.052
>> YES!

13:39.052 --> 13:40.020
>> YES!

13:40.020 --> 13:42.422
[laughter]

13:42.422 --> 13:44.157
>> * AND NOW I'M A NEW KIND *

13:44.157 --> 13:46.126
* OF WOMAN

13:50.397 --> 13:51.398
>> WHAT'S UP, BRO?

13:51.398 --> 13:52.465
WHERE WE GOIN' FOR LUNCH?

13:52.465 --> 13:53.400
>> UH, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A

13:53.400 --> 13:54.301
SEAT, MAN?

13:54.301 --> 13:55.302
I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF SOME

13:55.302 --> 13:59.106
BUSINESS FIRST.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.240
>> WHAT?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.142
>> THIS DOES INVOLVE YOU.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.543
>> OH.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.379
LET ME SIT UP.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.048
>> LISTEN, I'VE BEEN DOING SOME

14:08.048 --> 14:08.748
THINKING EVER SINCE OUR

14:08.748 --> 14:09.682
BASKETBALL GAME.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.650
>> [laughs]

14:10.650 --> 14:11.651
SO YOU THINKIN' ABOUT GOING PRO

14:11.651 --> 14:12.619
NOW?

14:12.619 --> 14:13.553
LOOK, MAN, I TOLD YOU.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.421
I LET YOU MAKE THOSE LUCKY

14:14.421 --> 14:15.288
SHOTS.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.057
>> HA, HA, VERY FUNNY.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.225
YOU GOT JOKES NOW, HMM?

14:18.225 --> 14:21.061
NO, MAN, THAT'S NOT IT.

14:21.061 --> 14:25.232
UH, I WANT US TO RUN THE COMPANY

14:25.232 --> 14:28.401
TOGETHER.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.370
I DO.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.307
CO-CEOs.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.742
THAT'S THE WAY POPS WANTED IT.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.177
>> [sighs]

14:37.177 --> 14:39.279
>> HMM?

14:39.279 --> 14:40.247
WHAT'S WRONG?

14:40.247 --> 14:42.115
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPY.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.716
>> I'M JUST--USED TO BE YOU

14:43.716 --> 14:44.751
COULDN'T KEEP ME FAR ENOUGH AWAY

14:44.751 --> 14:46.086
FROM HERE.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.687
WHAT CHANGED?

14:47.687 --> 14:51.058
>> WE DID.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.825
YEAH, WE'VE BOTH DONE SOME

14:52.825 --> 14:56.396
GROWING UP SINCE--SINCE POPS

14:56.396 --> 14:57.264
DIED.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.333
IT'S A SHAME THAT HE NEVER LIVED

15:00.333 --> 15:04.071
LONG ENOUGH TO SEE IT, BUT...

15:04.071 --> 15:07.074
ANYWAY, AND WHEN ALL THAT STUFF

15:07.074 --> 15:09.376
WENT DOWN WITH DEACON, WE MADE

15:09.376 --> 15:12.079
A GOOD TEAM.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.246
>> WE DID A'IGHT.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.381
[laughter]

15:14.381 --> 15:15.382
>> LOOK, YOU KNOW THINGS HAVE

15:15.382 --> 15:16.383
BEEN COMPLICATED WITH THE

15:16.383 --> 15:18.151
COMPANY, RIGHT?

15:18.151 --> 15:19.219
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS THAT

15:19.219 --> 15:20.787
I ACTUALLY WENT TO LUKE, AND

15:20.787 --> 15:22.389
ASKED HIM FOR HELP WITH DEALING

15:22.389 --> 15:23.456
WITH DEACON.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.757
>> WHY LUKE?

15:24.757 --> 15:25.758
>> THEY WERE TIGHT, AND I JUST

15:25.758 --> 15:27.227
FIGURED THAT LUKE WOULD BE ABLE

15:27.227 --> 15:29.296
TO GET DEACON UNDER CONTROL.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.297
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT DEACON WAS

15:30.297 --> 15:31.398
INTO LUKE FOR A LOT OF MONEY.

15:31.398 --> 15:32.832
>> W-W-W--THE FIRE?

15:32.832 --> 15:33.800
>> I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

15:33.800 --> 15:34.667
THAT, ALL RIGHT?

15:34.667 --> 15:36.203
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.170
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT LUKE

15:37.170 --> 15:38.338
DID.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.239
>> THEN YOU HAVE TO CUT TIES,

15:39.239 --> 15:40.107
MALCOLM.

15:40.107 --> 15:40.773
>> I CAN'T DO THAT.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.708
I MEAN, LUKE HAS ALL THESE

15:41.708 --> 15:43.310
JUDGES IN HIS BACK POCKET, AND I

15:43.310 --> 15:44.411
MIGHT NEED THOSE JUDGES IF THIS

15:44.411 --> 15:48.348
INDICTMENT COMES DOWN, MAN.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.482
I KNOW.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.780
YOU KNOW, I HAD NO IDEA THE

20:13.780 --> 20:15.615
PROSPECT OF BEING YOUR WIFE

20:15.615 --> 20:17.484
WOULD MAKE ME FEEL THIS WAY.

20:17.484 --> 20:18.217
>> HMM.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.886
AND JUST WHAT WAY IS THAT?

20:19.886 --> 20:21.220

21:03.330 --> 21:06.966
MOSTLY...STRAIGHT MEN.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.901

BROTHER DID TO DEACON.

21:42.602 --> 21:44.504
HE OWED ME.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.205
BUT NOW HE CAN'T PAY, SO YOU TWO

21:46.205 --> 21:51.644
HAVE TO.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.881
>> THIS IS A PARTY, BRIG.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.916
IT'S MY PARTY.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.551
IT'S NOT REALLY THE APPROPRIATE

21:58.551 --> 21:59.552
PLACE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION LIKE

21:59.552 --> 22:00.553
THIS.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.555
>> THERE IS NO DISCUSSION.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.890
YOU TWO ARE GONNA PAY UP.

22:03.890 --> 22:04.957

MALCOLM, BUT I'M FINDING IT HARD

22:06.893 --> 22:08.961
TO SEE HOW ANYONE OWES YOU

22:08.961 --> 22:10.963
ANYTHING HERE, BRIG.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.932
>> THIS DON'T CONCERN YOU.

22:12.932 --> 22:13.966
>> QUITE CONTRARILY, MY GOOD

22:59.879 --> 23:00.880
YOU AND I KILLED DEACON.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.048
AND NOW THEY'RE EXPECTING US TO

23:02.048 --> 23:03.315
PAY HIS DEBTS.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.017
>> HEY...

23:05.017 --> 23:06.285
FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO WORRY

23:06.285 --> 23:07.587
ABOUT.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.055
THAT WILL BE HANDLED.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.758
>> LIKE YOU DID DEACON?

23:11.758 --> 23:12.892
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO DEACON WAS

23:12.892 --> 23:14.894
AN ACCIDENT.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.896
I DO, HOWEVER, OWE YOUR BROTHER.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.030
>> IT'S A LONG TIME AGO, AND YOU

23:18.030 --> 23:19.331
PAID ME BACK, LUKE.

23:19.331 --> 23:20.600
>> [laughs]

23:20.600 --> 23:22.301
IT'S NEVER ABOUT THE MONEY.

23:22.301 --> 23:23.770
YOU SEE, YOUR BROTHER HERE, HE

23:23.770 --> 23:25.905
PAID OFF A GAMBLING DEBT FOR ME,

23:25.905 --> 23:28.040
TO A LOAN SHARK.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.042
DUDE SAID HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.110
>> COULD'VE VERY EASILY HAPPENED

23:31.110 --> 23:32.078
TO ME.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.112
>> NAH.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.981
YOU ALWAYS KNEW WHEN TO QUIT.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.583
>> YEAH, I DID.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.684
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY TERRENCE

23:37.684 --> 23:38.918
AND I ARE GONNA QUIT NOW.

23:38.918 --> 23:39.952
LOOK, LUKE, I APPRECIATE

23:39.952 --> 23:41.053
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE DONE.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.689
BUT I THINK TERRENCE AND I ARE

23:42.689 --> 23:43.790
GONNA HANDLE THINGS ON OUR OWN

23:43.790 --> 23:44.891
FROM THIS POINT ON.

23:44.891 --> 23:47.126
>> ARE YOU CERTAIN OF THIS?

23:47.126 --> 23:48.327
I THINK IT DESERVES SOME CAREFUL

23:48.327 --> 23:49.729
CONSIDERATION.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.731
THIS SHOULD NOT BE MISHANDLED.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.966
YOU KNOW HOW THE GAME IS.

23:53.966 --> 23:57.870
EITHER YOU IN OR YOU OUT.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.872
CAN'T BE BOTH.

EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF TESTOSTERONE

24:07.847 --> 24:09.782
CAUSES MEN TO GO BALD, AND I

24:09.782 --> 24:13.019
DON'T CARE.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.921
YOU MUST BE HIGH.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.361
THANK YOU.

24:22.361 --> 24:27.700

24:29.035 --> 24:30.937
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT?

24:30.937 --> 24:32.404

24:32.404 --> 24:33.405
>> WHY DO YOU THINK I'M IN A

24:33.405 --> 24:34.741
BAND?

24:34.741 --> 24:35.708
>> SO YOU'RE REALLY GONNA ACT

24:35.708 --> 24:36.843
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM?

24:36.843 --> 24:38.110
>> IF I WOULD'VE MET YOU, I

24:38.110 --> 24:42.849
WOULD'VE REMEMBERED.

24:55.862 --> 24:56.929
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW!

24:56.929 --> 24:57.897

24:57.897 --> 24:58.765
GOT YOUR SWIRL ON?

24:58.765 --> 24:59.699

27:17.336 --> 27:18.204
IN YOUR POOL.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.138
>> [gasps] NO.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.407
SERGIO! NO!

27:21.407 --> 27:22.541
SERGIO. SER--

27:22.541 --> 27:24.076
[laughs] I'M SORRY.

27:24.076 --> 27:25.144
HE'S TOTALLY KIDDING.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.378
>> I'M NOT KIDDING.

27:26.378 --> 27:27.980
>> [gasps]

27:27.980 --> 27:29.882
HE'S NOT KIDDING.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.918
>> [howls]

27:31.918 --> 27:33.052
>> [laughter]

27:33.052 --> 27:34.954
>> COME ON.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.022
>> BYE!

27:36.022 --> 27:37.423
>> OH, RECEPTION.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.891
OH, I MISSED YOU.

27:38.891 --> 27:39.892
>> CAN'T YOU WAIT TO TWEET,

27:39.892 --> 27:40.893
SERGIO?

27:40.893 --> 27:43.963
WE'RE DRUNK IN THE MIDDLE OF...

27:43.963 --> 27:44.964
NOWHERE.

27:44.964 --> 27:45.898
>> WELL...

27:45.898 --> 27:46.866
>> OH, MY GOD.

27:46.866 --> 27:47.834
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? [sighs]

27:47.834 --> 27:48.600
>> DON'T YOU WORRY.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.136
I HAVE AN APP FOR THAT, LOOK.

27:50.136 --> 27:51.137
>> OH, YEAH. THAT'S GOOD.

27:51.137 --> 27:52.104
>> ALL RIGHT?

27:52.104 --> 27:53.039
>> OKAY.

27:53.039 --> 27:54.140
>> [laughs]

27:54.140 --> 27:55.141
>> * SAY WHAT I GOTTA SAY

27:55.141 --> 27:57.509
* DO WHAT I GOTTA DO

27:59.011 --> 28:00.880
>> YOU DID IT!

28:00.880 --> 28:02.414
>> WE DID IT.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.582
>> WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT?

28:03.582 --> 28:06.185
ME, YOU, AND FELICIA PRICE.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.755
>> MY FANTASY THREE-WAY.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.757
MY FASHION FANTASY THREE-WAY,

28:10.757 --> 28:12.124
BUT FOR THE RECORD, IT WOULD BE

28:12.124 --> 28:15.594
THE BEST NIGHT OF Y'ALL'S LIVES.

28:17.463 --> 28:18.597
>> HEY.

28:18.597 --> 28:19.665
>> HEY.

28:19.665 --> 28:20.967
YOU DISAPPEARED.

28:20.967 --> 28:24.536
>> YEAH.

28:24.536 --> 28:28.007
YEAH, SO LISTEN, SOME GUY THAT

28:28.007 --> 28:29.141
DEACON OWED MONEY TO SHOWED UP

28:29.141 --> 28:30.442
HERE LOOKIN' FOR IT, SO--IT'S

28:30.442 --> 28:31.677
OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

28:31.677 --> 28:32.678
LUKE AND I HANDLED THE

28:32.678 --> 28:34.513
SITUATION.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.482
>> WELL, HOW IS LUKE INVOLVED?

28:36.482 --> 28:38.951
>> I PAID A GAMBLING DEBT FOR

28:38.951 --> 28:40.586
LUKE A VERY LONG TIME AGO.

28:40.586 --> 28:43.022
SO HE OWED ME, AND I ASKED HIM

28:43.022 --> 28:44.123
TO HELP ME OUT WITH DEACON.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.091
>> MALCOLM--

28:45.091 --> 28:46.025
>> KEISHA, YOU ASKED ME TO TELL

28:46.025 --> 28:46.692
YOU EVERYTHING, AND I AM

28:46.692 --> 28:48.127
HONESTLY TELLING YOU EVERYTHING,

28:48.127 --> 28:50.162
OKAY?

28:50.162 --> 28:51.463
I THINK LUKE SET THAT FIRE

28:51.463 --> 28:52.531
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE WAS DOING

28:52.531 --> 28:53.966
ME A FAVOR.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.067
>> OH, MY GOD.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.002
>> I KNOW.

28:56.002 --> 28:56.969
BUT I AM DOING EVERYTHING THAT I

28:56.969 --> 28:57.804
CAN TO EXTRICATE MYSELF FROM

28:57.804 --> 28:59.071
THIS ENTIRE SITUATION.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.940
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.441
AND I LOVE YOU.

29:02.441 --> 29:07.713
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

29:07.713 --> 29:11.183
[dramatic music]

29:11.183 --> 29:14.053
>> [laughs]

29:14.053 --> 29:17.123
I HAD TO SEE THIS FOR MYSELF.

29:23.662 --> 29:24.630
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOIN'

29:24.630 --> 29:25.497
HERE?

29:25.497 --> 29:26.398
>> TRYING TO SAVE YOU FROM

29:26.398 --> 29:28.100
WASTING YOUR TIME, LIKE I DID.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.135
>> WHAT?

29:29.135 --> 29:30.236
>> YOU KNOW, WHEN MALCOLM LEFT

29:30.236 --> 29:32.438
ASHLEE FOR ME, SHE SWORE SHE'D

29:32.438 --> 29:34.841
NEVER GIVE HIM A DIVORCE.

29:34.841 --> 29:37.844
AND FROM WHAT HER LAWYERS SAY,

29:37.844 --> 29:39.245
SHE NEVER HAS.

29:39.245 --> 29:40.947
>> YOU LEFT ASHLEE FOR HER?

29:40.947 --> 29:41.981
>> [laughs]

29:41.981 --> 29:43.950
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

29:43.950 --> 29:45.317
AND HERE I WAS THINKING THAT'S

29:45.317 --> 29:47.353
WHY YOU HATED ME SO MUCH.

29:47.353 --> 29:50.256
WE WERE IN LOVE. YEAH.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.191
MALCOLM WAS GOING TO LEAVE

29:52.191 --> 29:54.460
ASHLEE, BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF

29:54.460 --> 29:58.430
LOSING HALF HIS FORTUNE.

29:58.430 --> 29:59.899
SO THE TIMING HAD TO BE JUST

29:59.899 --> 30:02.201
RIGHT.

30:02.201 --> 30:06.172
SO I WAITED.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.340
AND I WAITED, AND I WAITED, AND

30:08.340 --> 30:10.076
I WAITED!

30:10.076 --> 30:12.979
BUT THEN, I FINALLY GOT SMART.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.981
MOVED ON.

30:14.981 --> 30:15.948
>> WHAT IS GOING ON?

30:15.948 --> 30:17.083
WHY IS SHE HERE?

30:17.083 --> 30:19.318
>> BECAUSE SHE'S A LIAR, RAQUEL.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.220
SHE'S A LIAR, AND SHE'S OUT OF

30:21.220 --> 30:22.488
CONTROL.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.223
AND NAOMI, YOU KNOW DAMN WELL

30:24.223 --> 30:25.224
THAT PART OF YOUR DEAL, FOR YOUR

30:25.224 --> 30:27.459
LITTLE 10%, WAS TO STAY THE HELL

30:27.459 --> 30:29.962
OUT OF ATLANTA.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.230
>> YOU CAN'T CONTRACTUALLY KEEP

30:31.230 --> 30:33.232
SOMEONE OUT OF A CITY, MALCOLM.

30:33.232 --> 30:36.869
AND I'M BACK IN ATLANTA TO STAY.

30:36.869 --> 30:38.304
>> WELL, WE'RE GONNA SEE ABOUT

30:38.304 --> 30:40.306
THAT.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.408
TERRENCE, CAN YOU HANDLE THIS

30:42.408 --> 30:44.110
SITUATION, PLEASE?

30:44.110 --> 30:45.111
>> THAT'S ENOUGH, NAOMI.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.112
YOU'RE LEAVING.

30:46.112 --> 30:47.246
>> NO.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.982
NO.

30:49.982 --> 30:50.983
I'M LEAVING.

30:50.983 --> 30:51.951
>> WAIT, WHAT?

30:51.951 --> 30:52.952
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.054
I CAN EXPLAIN THIS, KE--WAIT.

30:55.054 --> 30:56.355
>> I AM THROUGH WITH YOU.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.124
DO YOU HEAR ME?

30:58.124 --> 31:00.226
NO MORE EXPLANATIONS.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.994
>> KEISHA, YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

31:01.994 --> 31:04.130
>> DON'T.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.065
DON'T YOU TOUCH ME.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.366
DON'T COME LOOKIN' FOR ME,

31:07.366 --> 31:10.036
BECAUSE I SWEAR, I WILL NOT BE

31:10.036 --> 31:11.337
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT I MIGHT DO

31:11.337 --> 31:14.006
TO YOU.

31:14.006 --> 31:15.007
>> KEISHA.

31:15.007 --> 31:19.411
>> NO!

31:19.411 --> 31:22.414
>> [sighs]

31:31.123 --> 31:32.624
YOU PSYCHOTIC BITCH.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.093
>> MALCOLM, MA--HEY! HEY!

31:34.093 --> 31:35.227
HEY, MALCOLM, HEY.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.362
IT'S NOT WORTH IT, MAN.

31:36.362 --> 31:37.964
I GOT IT.

31:37.964 --> 31:39.365
COME ON NAOMI, LET'S GO.

31:39.365 --> 31:44.036
>> GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

31:44.036 --> 31:49.275
EVERYTHING I SAID IS THE TRUTH.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.977
SHE'LL BE THANKING ME FOR WHAT I

31:50.977 --> 31:51.978
JUST DID.

31:51.978 --> 31:52.979
>> NO ONE'S GONNA BE THANKING

31:52.979 --> 31:54.246
YOU, NAOMI.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.215
>> AND YOUR BROTHER WILL COME

31:56.215 --> 31:58.384
CRAWLING BACK TO ME, LIKE HE

31:58.384 --> 31:59.986
ALWAYS DOES.

31:59.986 --> 32:02.021
>> OH, I DOUBT THAT.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.055
>> WHY DON'T WE ASK HIM AT THE

32:03.055 --> 32:04.756
NEXT BOARD MEETING?

32:04.756 --> 32:06.458
I DO OWN 10% OF YOUR COMPANY,

32:06.458 --> 32:09.128
REMEMBER?

32:17.436 --> 32:20.139
>> KEISHA!

32:20.139 --> 32:24.076
KEISHA, STOP.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.045
>> HE WAS IN LOVE WITH THAT

32:26.045 --> 32:27.479
BITCH...

32:27.479 --> 32:30.049
AND HE LEFT HIS WIFE FOR HER.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.051
HE MADE IT SEEM LIKE A FLING.

32:32.051 --> 32:33.085
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TRUTH

32:33.085 --> 32:34.020
IS.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.021
THE LEAST THAT YOU CAN DO IS LET

32:35.021 --> 32:36.022
MALCOLM EXPLAIN.

32:36.022 --> 32:37.589
>> I AM DONE WITH HIS

32:37.589 --> 32:39.625
EXPLANATIONS AND BAD CHOICES,

32:39.625 --> 32:42.028
CHOICES HE MAKES OVER AND OVER.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.129
>> OKAY.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.063
OKAY, BABE.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.097
LET ME TAKE YOU HOME.

32:45.097 --> 32:46.198
>> NO.

32:46.198 --> 32:49.435
I GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS TOWN.

32:49.435 --> 32:52.304
PLEASE, YOU'VE GOT TO BUY ME

32:52.304 --> 32:55.207
TIME SO I CAN GET OUT OF HERE.

32:55.207 --> 33:00.179
[whispering] PLEASE.

33:00.179 --> 33:03.315
>> OKAY.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.383
OKAY.

33:04.383 --> 33:08.120
I GOT YOU.

33:10.422 --> 33:13.325
GO.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.261
>> GOODBYE.

33:15.261 --> 33:20.532
>> GO.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.268
[sighs]

33:29.108 --> 33:30.409
>> OH!

33:30.409 --> 33:31.610
OH, MY GOD.

33:31.610 --> 33:32.711
>> [laughs]

33:32.711 --> 33:35.614
>> [grunts]

33:35.614 --> 33:36.715
>> CAN YOU TAKE US SOMEWHERE

33:36.715 --> 33:38.084
THAT WE CAN DRINK AND DANCE ALL

33:38.084 --> 33:39.085
NIGHT WITHOUT GETTING KICKED

33:39.085 --> 33:39.751
OUT?

33:39.751 --> 33:40.786
>> I KNOW JUST THE PLACE.

33:40.786 --> 33:42.454
>> YEAH.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.098
>> HEY.

33:52.098 --> 33:53.632
YOU OKAY?

33:53.632 --> 33:55.301
>> NO.

33:55.301 --> 33:56.368
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE IN

33:56.368 --> 33:57.336
CHARGE OF THE COMPANY FOR A

33:57.336 --> 33:58.337
WHILE.

33:58.337 --> 34:00.239
I REALLY MESSED UP THIS TIME.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.174
OKAY?

34:02.174 --> 34:03.509
AND I-I REALLY GOT TO TRY AND

34:03.509 --> 34:05.177
MAKE THIS RIGHT, SO I'M SORRY TO

34:05.177 --> 34:06.312
LEAVE ALL THIS STUFF IN YOUR

34:06.312 --> 34:09.115
LAP, BUT YOU CAN DO THIS.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.116
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.483
BUT I CAN'T LOSE KEISHA.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.119
>> MALCOLM, IT'S OKAY.

34:13.119 --> 34:14.153
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE HER.

34:14.153 --> 34:15.354
>> AND I KNOW ALL THIS STUFF

34:15.354 --> 34:16.888
WITH DEACON AND LUKE AND NAOMI,

34:16.888 --> 34:20.759
AND--I MEAN, SHE'S PROBABLY

BRO?

34:24.263 --> 34:27.233
GO GET HER.

34:33.339 --> 34:34.640
>> I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M GONNA

34:34.640 --> 34:35.807
BE BACK.

34:35.807 --> 34:37.276
>> OKAY, MALCOLM.

34:37.276 --> 34:40.712
I GOT THIS.

34:45.317 --> 34:48.554
GO GET YOUR GIRL, BRO.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.656

YOU SEE THAT?

36:09.968 --> 36:12.471
THIS HAS BEEN ONE HELL OF A
