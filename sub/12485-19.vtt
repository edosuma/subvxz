13:29.479 --> 13:31.581
AS OLIVE: Bring back
the F.A.F.Y.P.T.C.!

13:31.581 --> 13:34.484
Write your congressman!

13:34.484 --> 13:38.388
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Ugh!
You guys are driving me mad!
I can't take it anymore!

13:38.388 --> 13:40.250
Pull yourself
together, woman!

13:40.250 --> 13:42.552
Ow! Olive!

13:42.552 --> 13:45.355
AS OLIVE: That wasn't me.
 AS VIOLET: Sorry, it was me.

13:45.355 --> 13:48.158
It's just so fun to play
with these controls.

13:48.158 --> 13:51.461
Why you hitting yourself?
Why you hitting yourself?
Why you hitting yourself?

13:51.461 --> 13:53.503
Why you hitting yourself?
 (GROANING)

14:01.011 --> 14:05.475
At last, my evil plan
is near completion.
(LAUGHING EVILLY)

14:05.475 --> 14:07.277
What do you intend
to do with us?

14:07.277 --> 14:11.181
Obviously, extract all
the Ants' personalities,

14:11.181 --> 14:13.924
including yours,
from your brain.

14:13.924 --> 14:17.587
And then when I eat
all that yogurt,

14:17.587 --> 14:24.094
I will be a super woman
with all of your talents
and my good looks.

14:24.094 --> 14:27.297
AS FLETCHER: Good looks?
More like...
(MUMBLING INCOHERENTLY)

14:27.297 --> 14:29.599
Drones, put Chyna
in the chair!

14:29.599 --> 14:31.341
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
No! Don't listen to her!

14:31.341 --> 14:33.173
Oh, I'm sorry, Chyna.

14:33.173 --> 14:37.147
But they are programmed
to respond only
to my soothing voice.

14:37.147 --> 14:39.879
Now put Chyna
in the chair,
you worthless drones!

14:41.211 --> 14:43.383
No!

14:43.383 --> 14:49.319
Now, unlike movie villains,
who leave before seeing their
plan through to completion,

14:49.319 --> 14:52.562
thus enabling
the hero to escape,

14:52.562 --> 14:55.365
I am going to
throw the switch myself.

14:56.466 --> 14:58.168
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

14:59.099 --> 15:01.271
I have to take that.

15:01.271 --> 15:04.004
Drones, see my plan
through to completion.

15:05.275 --> 15:07.177
Hello?

15:07.177 --> 15:10.480
Oh! Timeshare in Santa Fe?

15:10.480 --> 15:15.645
Yes, I am interested.
Yes, I do have
a major credit card.

15:18.148 --> 15:20.350
Oh, we're doomed!
 No, we're not!

15:20.350 --> 15:24.424
If the drones only respond
to Skidmore's voice, we just
have to imitate Skidmore!

15:24.424 --> 15:26.326
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Got it.

15:26.326 --> 15:30.000
(GRUFFLY)
Drones! It is I,
Principal Skidmore,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.502
speaking to you
from inside of Chyna.

15:32.502 --> 15:35.105
How did I get in here?
It's not important.

15:37.407 --> 15:39.009
They're not buying it.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.012
Step aside.

15:42.012 --> 15:44.444
It just so happens,
I do a perfect
Skidmore impersonation.

15:44.444 --> 15:48.718
You? Everyone you imitate
sounds like a bad
Christopher Walken impression.

15:48.718 --> 15:52.422
(SQUEAKILY) "Hi,
I'm Christopher Walken."

15:52.422 --> 15:56.486
(SAME VOICE) "Hi,
I'm President Obama."

15:56.486 --> 16:00.460
Hey, that's not a bad
"Fletcher-doing-a-bad
President-Obama-imitation

16:00.460 --> 16:04.694
"that-sounds-like-a-bad
Christopher-Walken-imitation"
imitation.

16:04.694 --> 16:07.267
Just give me a chance.
I'm really good at it.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.969
(SIGHING) Okay.
 CHYNA: And then
a miracle happened.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.372
For the first time ever,
Fletcher was right!
 (INAUDIBLE)

16:12.372 --> 16:14.604
His Skidmore impression
was dead on.

16:14.604 --> 16:16.646
He was able to instruct
the drones to extract

16:16.646 --> 16:19.409
all the personalities
from my brain
and eat the yogurt.

16:19.409 --> 16:21.181
(ELECTRICITY SURGING)

16:24.114 --> 16:25.485
There was only one problem.

16:28.218 --> 16:30.320
AS FLETCHER: So, did it work?

16:30.320 --> 16:32.422
AS VIOLET:
You're wearing floral pants
and a pink cardigan.

16:32.422 --> 16:33.563
What do you think?

16:36.196 --> 16:37.727
CHYNA: They ate
the wrong yogurt.

16:43.233 --> 16:47.577
(YAWNING)
Hey, everybody.
Outfit. Pretty.

16:50.080 --> 16:53.012
Welcome, Lexi... To dreamland.

16:53.443 --> 16:55.745
(PLAYING TUNE)

16:55.745 --> 16:58.248
Cameron, what is going on?

16:58.248 --> 17:00.290
You're having a real dream.

17:00.290 --> 17:03.253
Not a fake dream
that I set up to
trick you into kissing me.

17:05.295 --> 17:09.259
Because if this
weren't a dream,
would I have these fish hands?

17:12.301 --> 17:16.035
We're up to the part
of your dream
where you kiss me.

17:16.035 --> 17:19.138
Okay. Here you go,
dream boy.

17:24.214 --> 17:28.047
This is just like I imagined
it earlier when I practiced
on the fish.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.720
Thank you, Cameron.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.552
No, thank you, baby.

17:33.723 --> 17:36.186
I mean, thanks to this,
I should be over

17:36.186 --> 17:38.228
whatever caused
those creepy dreams.

17:38.228 --> 17:42.232
But don't worry, Cameron.
There are plenty
of fish in the sea.

17:42.792 --> 17:44.194
(YELPS)

17:53.343 --> 17:55.545
AS FLETCHER: I can't believe
I'm trapped inside Olive!

17:55.545 --> 17:59.579
Ugh! Her brain has
interesting factoid
sticky notes everywhere!

18:01.211 --> 18:03.413
AS CHYNA: I'm in Violet?

18:03.413 --> 18:06.656
You know what?
You'd look really cute
with a French braid.

18:06.656 --> 18:10.690
AS VIOLET: Hey! Stop that!
And you'd better
take care of my body!

18:10.690 --> 18:14.124
Just like I plan
on taking care
of this adorable body.

18:17.427 --> 18:21.571
AS CHYNA: Wait.
If I'm in Violet,
and Violet is in Fletcher,

18:21.571 --> 18:25.405
and Fletcher is in Olive,
then who's inside my body?

18:25.405 --> 18:27.807
AS OLIVE: Interesting factoid
about identity theft...

18:29.709 --> 18:34.284
Wait! If I'm inside Chyna,
then I can sing
my interesting factoids,

18:34.284 --> 18:38.448
making them interesting
and entertaining factoids.

18:38.448 --> 18:41.491
♪ On average, identity theft
costs U.S. consumers

18:41.491 --> 18:45.295
♪ Over $1.52 billion
per year... ♪

18:45.295 --> 18:47.126
AS FLETCHER: Stop singing!

18:48.628 --> 18:50.560
AS CHYNA: Calm down.
We just need to extract

18:50.560 --> 18:53.663
our personalities again
and get them
into the right bodies.

18:53.663 --> 18:56.406
Oh, don't bother.

18:56.406 --> 18:59.709
Because in a matter
of seconds, your minds
will be nothing but mush.

18:59.709 --> 19:01.341
AS CHYNA: What?

19:01.341 --> 19:05.275
You may have foiled
my personality stealing plan,

19:05.275 --> 19:10.450
but when I press this button,
all the yogurt you ate
will self-destruct

19:10.450 --> 19:13.383
and melt your
brains forever!

19:13.383 --> 19:14.824
(BEEPS)
 DISPATCHER: Senior Alert.

19:14.824 --> 19:17.557
Ms. Skidmore, did you fall
in the bathtub again?

19:18.628 --> 19:20.490
Wrong remote!
(CHUCKLING SHEEPISHLY)

19:22.562 --> 19:25.765
No, this is the remote
for my heated slippers...

19:25.765 --> 19:26.896
AS OLIVE: The lever!

19:29.299 --> 19:30.440
(ELECTRICITY SURGING)

19:34.444 --> 19:37.507
Wow. She does not have
a lot of personality.

19:39.609 --> 19:42.582
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
So with the Ants safe
from Skidmore's villainy,

19:42.582 --> 19:45.184
we all switched back
to our normal bodies,

19:45.184 --> 19:47.287
and we live
happily ever after.

19:48.388 --> 19:51.190
That would make
a pretty great movie, huh?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.962
It depends.

19:52.962 --> 19:55.795
If this thing gets made,
can I be your date
to the premiere?

19:57.427 --> 19:59.729
You ask her that
right in front of me?

20:02.372 --> 20:06.336
Wow, Chyna. How did you
make up an idea like that?

20:06.336 --> 20:08.207
Who says I made it up?

20:12.912 --> 20:15.685
AS SKIDMORE: What are you
rotten kids looking at?
Get to class!

20:15.685 --> 20:17.447
(ALL SCREAMING)

20:22.352 --> 20:23.593
(CHUCKLING)

20:32.302 --> 20:36.966
(SIGHING) I finally
got some sleep.
I feel so much better.

20:36.966 --> 20:39.269
You look pretty good, Lexi.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.443
No, you look
pretty good, Lexi.

20:43.443 --> 20:47.647
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

20:50.820 --> 20:53.923
Oh, thank goodness.
Everything is back to normal.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.557
Ugh. It's so warm out here.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.460
Sorry. I'll turn it up.
