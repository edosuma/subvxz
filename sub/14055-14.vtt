00:01.976 --> 00:03.096
Previously on The O.C.:

00:03.176 --> 00:04.776
Rebecca is gone.
What did you say to her?

00:04.856 --> 00:06.696
I asked her if she was
in love with you,

00:06.696 --> 00:07.856
and she said she was.

00:07.856 --> 00:09.976
I tried to tell Summer, and I couldn't.

00:10.056 --> 00:11.576
So you're here to break up with me?

00:11.576 --> 00:12.456
Then I told her.

00:12.456 --> 00:14.896
I just believe in
taking every precaution.

00:14.896 --> 00:16.616
Caleb is gonna ask for a DNA test.

00:16.616 --> 00:18.776
- You can't let him adopt you.
- What are you talking about?

00:18.776 --> 00:20.416
He might not be your dad.

00:20.416 --> 00:23.576
When we were about to...
there was this voice in my head.

00:23.576 --> 00:24.496
Seth?

00:24.496 --> 00:28.536
Have a great time in Italy.
I'm cool with it. I'm over you.

00:35.656 --> 00:39.976
<i>Well, I cannot believe I'm saying this,
but it's raining in the O.C.</i>

00:40.096 --> 00:44.376
<i>I know, it's crazy. I got to tell you, the
traffic is a nightmare. The 405 is jammed.</i>

00:44.376 --> 00:46.376
<i>The 5, the 710,
they're all gridlocked.</i>

00:46.496 --> 00:49.656
<i>Stay safe, stay dry, and let's all pray
for sunshine again.</i>

01:57.256 --> 02:00.096
Hey. I kind of need to talk to you.
So, you coming over for breakfast?

02:00.176 --> 02:01.736
You know, I got a little
cleaning up to do.

02:01.816 --> 02:02.776
Why don't you swing by the pool house?

02:02.856 --> 02:03.976
Uh, have you looked out the window?

02:04.096 --> 02:05.976
It's like the opening sequence
from Day After Tomorrow.

02:06.056 --> 02:07.976
It's just rain. I'll be here
if you need to talk.

02:08.056 --> 02:10.895
Dude, come on.
I'm a child of Southern California.

02:11.015 --> 02:15.976
I can't go out in this. I'll melt.
You want to do it over the phone?

02:16.096 --> 02:17.536
Works for me.

02:18.136 --> 02:24.296
So does this weather. It's very, uh,
reflective of my current emotional state.

02:24.376 --> 02:25.936
Yeah, I know what you mean.

02:28.776 --> 02:30.736
So I'm gonna lose her, man.

02:31.056 --> 02:33.736
Summer's leaving for Italy tomorrow,
and it's gonna be nothing but

02:33.856 --> 02:35.696
cannolis and canoodling with Zach.

02:35.816 --> 02:38.496
Yeah, well, I haven't talked to Lindsay,
since she ran out of Caleb's.

02:38.576 --> 02:41.496
- Well, you should talk to her.
- She won't talk to anyone.

02:42.176 --> 02:44.616
I don't know.
Maybe it'll all work out for the best.

02:44.736 --> 02:46.456
Yeah, maybe.

02:49.616 --> 02:52.576
You don't think that's God
trying to tell us anything, do you?

02:52.936 --> 02:55.376
I'm not gonna take that chance.
I've got to talk to Lindsay.

02:55.456 --> 02:59.176
Yeah? You think we should stick together?
Kind of two by two, like Noah did?

02:59.216 --> 03:01.416
He's very wise, Ryan. He had a beard.

03:01.496 --> 03:03.536
Just rain, can't hurt us.

03:06.216 --> 03:08.656
Not worse than our women can.

04:07.096 --> 04:11.736
It's 10:00.
Are you going to stay in bed all day?

04:12.576 --> 04:15.896
Maybe. I like it here.

04:19.656 --> 04:23.576
Oh, I feel like...
like we've become like strangers.

04:23.656 --> 04:25.936
Well, I was taught never
to talk to strangers.

04:27.176 --> 04:30.536
- Funny.
- Not trying to be.

04:32.976 --> 04:35.016
- I'm sorry you're upset.
- Really?

04:35.096 --> 04:37.496
'Cause last time I checked,
everything was all my fault.

04:37.576 --> 04:40.976
- I never said that.
- Not in those exact words.

04:53.216 --> 04:54.016
Hello?

04:54.056 --> 04:56.176
- Sandy?
- Rebecca.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.576
Now I'm up.

04:57.936 --> 05:02.496
I wanted to run, Sandy.
I, um, got on a bus. I was on my way,

05:02.656 --> 05:05.496
but I realized I couldn't
leave without saying good-bye.

05:05.736 --> 05:09.416
Well, as long as you don't flee, we
have a chance with your case. Please...

05:09.536 --> 05:11.816
stay where you are.

05:23.736 --> 05:26.336
- Hey.
- Good morning, Maris...

05:26.456 --> 05:29.256
Oh. I didn't know you had
a friend over last night.

05:29.376 --> 05:31.256
- I'm Julie Cooper Nichol.
- Alex.

05:31.336 --> 05:34.096
Ah, so, you're the feisty
young lady Caleb mentioned.

05:34.176 --> 05:35.336
Well, I was just making bagels.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.136
I figure if the Cohens
can do it, why can't we?

05:37.256 --> 05:38.856
Oh, none for me, thanks.
I don't eat breakfast.

05:38.976 --> 05:42.776
Oh, that's very punk of you. You know,
I used to like the punk in my day.

05:42.816 --> 05:43.536
Mom!

05:43.576 --> 05:45.416
Oh, you're right, Marissa.
It still is my day.

05:45.576 --> 05:51.896
I was just being modest.
Oh. We'll be keeping kosher in no time.

05:54.096 --> 05:58.816
So how about this weather, huh?
It's unbelievable.

05:59.376 --> 06:02.456
Yeah. I think I have to go.
But very nice to meet you.

06:02.496 --> 06:04.656
Oh. Rock on.

06:06.856 --> 06:08.336
She seems nice.

06:08.816 --> 06:10.856
And you know, I have no problem
if you want a friend to stay over.

06:10.856 --> 06:12.456
It's just if you could
let me know beforehand.

06:12.576 --> 06:13.896
Oh, you didn't get the memo?

06:14.616 --> 06:15.136
You know what, Marissa,

06:15.136 --> 06:18.976
I don't think it's too much to ask to know
what's going on underneath my roof. That's all.

06:19.056 --> 06:21.256
Oh, you want to know
what's going on with me.

06:21.576 --> 06:25.856
I'm going to tell you the truth.
No screaming, no crying, just the truth.

06:26.536 --> 06:28.736
You have no idea how happy
it makes me to hear that.

06:28.736 --> 06:31.736
Hold that thought...
Alex is my girlfriend.

06:31.856 --> 06:33.936
I know, and I'm so happy that
you've made a new friend,

06:33.936 --> 06:35.256
although I hope you keep seeing Summer.

06:35.256 --> 06:40.136
No, Mom, not my friend who's a girl,
my girlfriend.

07:24.696 --> 07:26.936
- What are you doing?
- You wouldn't open the door.

07:27.016 --> 07:29.696
- It's 'cause I don't want to see anyone.
- Please let me in.

07:29.776 --> 07:35.376
I rode my bike here. Bicycle. Monsoon.
Seriously flawed plan. Freezing.

07:35.696 --> 07:37.016
Come on.

07:40.816 --> 07:42.176
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

07:42.536 --> 07:44.416
Hold on.

07:47.776 --> 07:49.576
Okay, come here.

07:58.336 --> 08:00.496
Well, you could have opened
the door for me a half hour ago.

08:00.616 --> 08:05.776
Uh, I thought you were Caleb,
showing up to drive me to my DNA test.

08:06.056 --> 08:08.656
He scheduled you a DNA test?

08:09.496 --> 08:11.536
It was either that or the pony.

08:11.976 --> 08:14.136
- So you're not going?
- Mm, no way.

08:17.576 --> 08:19.376
Well, you're going somewhere.

08:19.656 --> 08:22.816
Yeah, I was going to pack up
to move in with my dad,

08:22.856 --> 08:27.896
but since he might not be my dad, uh,
I was thinking about packing up for...

08:28.576 --> 08:34.135
I don't know, maybe...
I don't know, Chicago.

08:35.816 --> 08:41.616
- Whoa. "I don't know, Chicago"?
- Yeah. We have family there.

08:42.736 --> 08:44.816
Actual, no-doubt-about-it, family.

08:44.976 --> 08:49.776
And my mom is thinking that
it getting out about her and Caleb,

08:49.976 --> 08:55.576
that maybe the best thing would be...
to start over.

08:55.976 --> 08:57.536
And you'd go with her?

08:58.696 --> 09:02.016
Well, if Caleb's not my dad,
what else can I do?

09:02.176 --> 09:04.256
Except you don't know he's not your dad.

09:09.096 --> 09:11.096
I don't know that I want to know.

09:11.616 --> 09:13.736
It's not going to stop
until you know the truth.

09:14.016 --> 09:19.816
And besides, if you are his daughter,
at least you'll have reason to stay.

09:20.736 --> 09:24.376
I mean... your other reason.

09:31.656 --> 09:33.456
I don't know, Ryan.

09:33.576 --> 09:37.936
"DNA test" just sounds so sci-fi scary.

09:38.856 --> 09:40.336
I'll go with you.

09:46.616 --> 09:48.856
Who looks good in this much yellow?

09:50.176 --> 09:51.896
Aye-aye-aye.

09:53.096 --> 09:54.416
Zach?

09:54.696 --> 09:57.736
Thank God. Look, I really
don't know about this dress.

09:58.496 --> 10:01.656
Hi. Just your friendly
neighborhood Seth Cohen.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.496
Okay. What?

10:03.616 --> 10:08.536
Well, I look stupid in hats,
and I don't have a raincoat, so

10:08.616 --> 10:11.456
Spider-Man here is really the only
protective, waterproof headgear I own.

10:11.576 --> 10:13.576
Well, it's too bad you weren't
wearing protective headgear

10:13.576 --> 10:15.456
when you were dropped
on your head as a child.

10:16.056 --> 10:20.056
Zing. So listen.

10:20.216 --> 10:24.696
Um, I know that my visits to your bedroom
are probably getting a little bit repetitive.

10:24.776 --> 10:27.776
- Hmm, you are helping me miss you less.
- Oh, well, that's great.

10:31.136 --> 10:34.216
- You're really going, huh?
- Yeah, of course I'm going.

10:34.336 --> 10:36.776
How could I not be?
I am in his sister's wedding.

10:37.096 --> 10:37.776
You are?

10:37.776 --> 10:39.816
Why do you think I look
like lemon meringue?

10:40.016 --> 10:43.176
- Bridesmaid's dress.
- You're a bridesmaid?

10:46.736 --> 10:50.696
Wow, that's really, uh...
Guess you and Zach are really serious.

10:50.696 --> 10:52.496
Cohen, are we going to do this again?

10:52.576 --> 10:55.296
Or did you, like, actually
come here to advance the plot?

10:55.376 --> 10:57.856
You're, like, part of his family.

11:00.536 --> 11:04.416
Okay, the reason I came
by is to tell you...

11:05.896 --> 11:08.936
uh, you need to take a special plug for
the outlets there,

11:09.096 --> 11:12.256
for your hair dryer. Don't want you
to brown out western Europe.

11:13.496 --> 11:19.216
Good-bye again. And, uh, you have
a safe flight. Yes. Bon voyage.

11:54.616 --> 11:56.336
- Thanks for coming.
- Well, it wasn't easy.

11:56.576 --> 11:59.976
Rains in Southern California,
all of a sudden nobody can drive.

12:05.656 --> 12:06.976
You're shaking.

12:08.616 --> 12:10.896
- Sandy, I don't want to run anymore.
- Come back with me.

12:10.896 --> 12:14.576
And do what? Sit in jail?
Destroy your marriage?

12:14.856 --> 12:17.376
My marriage has nothing
to do with your case.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.856
Come back with me. We'll explore amnesty,
or some kind of plea bargain.

12:20.976 --> 12:22.736
I think we can make this right.

12:38.835 --> 12:40.795
- I told her.
- You told who what?

12:40.915 --> 12:44.395
My mom, about us.
I can't believe it, but I did.

12:44.515 --> 12:49.075
- What... you, uh, you told her?
- Well, I thought you'd be happy.

12:49.155 --> 12:52.355
No, I... it just depends.
Did you tell her to piss her off?

12:52.755 --> 12:58.515
Hey, look, I told her
so this could be real. For us.

13:01.755 --> 13:04.435
So what happens now?

13:04.555 --> 13:07.715
She's probably having a meltdown
as we speak, so I can't go home.

13:07.795 --> 13:10.115
- So stay here.
- You sure?

13:12.863 --> 13:17.023
But first, let's get you
out of these wet clothes.

13:30.350 --> 13:31.670
Thanks for coming with me.

13:31.750 --> 13:34.270
Hey, what's more romantic
than a DNA test?

13:35.950 --> 13:39.190
Maybe we can donate kidneys
one Saturday night.

13:39.230 --> 13:40.910
Now we're talking.

13:45.150 --> 13:52.550
So if in 24 hours, it turns out Caleb
is my dad, then what?

13:53.830 --> 13:58.550
You talking dirty to me?
Sorry.

13:58.630 --> 14:03.030
Well, if the test comes back positive,
then he'll adopt you, right?

14:05.070 --> 14:10.030
Right. Except I don't know
if I want him to adopt me.

14:10.230 --> 14:14.990
Well, you're not going to Chicago,
so let's just forget about that option.

14:15.150 --> 14:22.430
No, I... I know that.
I couldn't handle the cold and the wind.

14:22.510 --> 14:25.150
- It is the Windy City.
- I'm not a big fan of deep dish pizza.

14:25.230 --> 14:31.670
- Thin crust, only way to go.
- I couldn't be without you.

14:35.910 --> 14:39.990
So I come in right below pizza.
That's good to know.

14:40.070 --> 14:43.510
Yeah, well, a girl's got to eat.

14:44.430 --> 14:45.750
Right.

14:53.110 --> 14:55.390
What are you doing here
late on a Saturday?

14:55.470 --> 14:59.590
Oh, hey, Julie. I'm just trying
to distract myself and failing.

15:00.350 --> 15:01.830
- What about you?
- Same.

15:02.670 --> 15:04.350
So how long is this weather
supposed to last?

15:04.470 --> 15:07.630
- News says 24 hours.
- I don't think my hair can take it.

15:07.750 --> 15:12.310
- I don't know if my marriage can.
- Ooh. Gossip?

15:12.550 --> 15:14.070
You have no idea.

15:14.430 --> 15:17.270
Want to break into Caleb's liquor
cabinet, dish some dirt?

15:23.670 --> 15:26.790
- I'd like to use this on Caleb sometimes.
- I know what you mean.

15:26.870 --> 15:28.670
- More scotch?
- Sure, why not?

15:28.790 --> 15:32.310
Nothing like a rainy day to reflect
on what a mess your life is, huh?

15:32.390 --> 15:36.390
I mean, not yours per se.
It was, you know, the universal you.

15:37.270 --> 15:41.550
My life is a pretty big mess.
I may even beat you on that one.

15:41.550 --> 15:43.870
Oh, I don't think so,
honey, but go ahead.

15:43.990 --> 15:49.990
Well, my husband is currently transporting
a fugitive who used to be his ex-girlfriend.

15:50.110 --> 15:55.230
Oh. Well, I'll see your fugitive former
flame and raise you a lesbian daughter.

15:55.310 --> 16:00.070
Marissa?
Well, I'm sure it's just a phase.

16:00.470 --> 16:05.910
It was for me.
And it is for you, too.

16:05.990 --> 16:10.710
- You guys will work it out.
- I'm not so sure.

16:10.950 --> 16:13.830
No, Kirsten, seriously,
you have to work it out.

16:13.830 --> 16:15.590
I mean, I couldn't
handle it if you didn't.

16:15.590 --> 16:20.550
You two are, like, the moral center
of the universe. You're...

16:20.670 --> 16:22.110
you're Sandy and Kirsten.

16:22.230 --> 16:28.070
Yeah, well, now we're Sandy
and Kirsten... and Rebecca.

16:34.030 --> 16:37.830
- Oh, no. Police.
- Take it easy. We're fine.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.910
Sir, the road is completely
washed out ahead.

16:44.910 --> 16:47.870
We need you to turn around. We should
have the road open by morning.

16:47.950 --> 16:49.710
- Not till morning?
- Yes, sir.

16:49.790 --> 16:52.070
There's lodging a few miles back.

16:52.590 --> 16:55.030
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:08.550 --> 17:10.190
You're listening to Boyz II Men?

17:11.670 --> 17:14.589
I can think of no sadder song
in the whole world.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.790
So I'm guessing it didn't go well.

17:21.390 --> 17:26.270
Unless I can think of one last grand
romantic gesture, Summer's gone.

17:28.230 --> 17:30.710
You know, I remember when
I first heard about Summer.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.790
You were sailing and you said
you named your boat after her.

17:32.830 --> 17:35.310
Which I thought was a little weird,
considering you never actually talked to her.

17:35.510 --> 17:39.390
Eureka, Ryan. I can't believe I just
said eureka. That's okay. That's it.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.870
- What's it?
- The thing to win her back.

17:40.950 --> 17:45.190
The grand romantic gesture, that's going
to put Zachary's Euro trip to shame.

17:45.270 --> 17:50.030
I shall take her on a sailing adventure
aboard the Summer Breeze.

17:51.150 --> 17:55.110
- Except you sold the boat for bus fare.
- I did. Damn it.

17:55.430 --> 17:59.830
Eureka, Ryan! I shall buy back
the Summer Breeze. Yes.

18:00.670 --> 18:01.870
Except with what money?

18:01.870 --> 18:04.510
Okay, if I wanted my parade rained on,
I would just step outside.

18:04.590 --> 18:06.590
Let me ask you something.
Do you like the shape of the idea, even?

18:06.590 --> 18:08.430
- Definitely.
- Okay, great, so all I need is money.

18:08.430 --> 18:10.710
Hang on.
Yes, got the answer.

18:10.790 --> 18:15.150
But before I say eureka again, do you see
any other potential flaws or holes in my plan?

18:15.190 --> 18:19.790
- No
- Then, eureka, Ryan. U-freaking-reka!

18:20.910 --> 18:23.750
Turn this music off. It's depressing me.

18:40.470 --> 18:41.790
Come in.

18:47.750 --> 18:51.110
Uh, you're listening to Boyz II Men?
This song is so sad.

18:51.630 --> 18:57.590
- Yeah. I was waiting for Motown Philly.
- Oh, right.

18:58.350 --> 19:00.270
Hey, thanks.

19:00.350 --> 19:03.510
Oh, my God.
You're taking all that?

19:03.750 --> 19:06.710
Well, yeah. I don't want
the Italians to think I have bad style.

19:06.790 --> 19:10.950
- I am representing America.
- Well, that's very patriotic of you.

19:11.030 --> 19:16.030
I just... we're going to be backpacking.
You know, going from hostel to hostel.

19:16.190 --> 19:19.110
Ew. You haven't seen hostile
until you put me up in one.

19:19.230 --> 19:20.910
No, it'll be fun, an adventure.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.710
Look, and also, don't you think it's a little
much that I'm in your sister's wedding?

19:23.710 --> 19:26.150
I mean, after all,
I've only met her, like, once.

19:26.230 --> 19:30.430
No, I told you, she doesn't have very many
friends. She's very alienating and severe.

19:32.710 --> 19:37.750
- Do you not want to come?
- No. Yes. I just...

19:38.870 --> 19:41.110
I have to get a special plug
for my hair dryer.

19:41.910 --> 19:49.110
- I already got you one.
- Of course you did.

19:55.550 --> 19:58.230
- Seth! You here to fight crime?

19:59.390 --> 20:02.150
No, actually, I'm here to get
my job back.

20:02.150 --> 20:05.790
No. No, no, no, no. What, you were, like,
the flakiest employee in Bait Shop history.

20:05.870 --> 20:08.350
You think that's an easy accomplishment?
What about Homer the beer guy?

20:08.430 --> 20:10.790
And how long would you be planning
on keeping your job this time?

20:10.870 --> 20:15.630
Until I can make $500. So however long
that is,please. Alex, Alex, Alex, please.

20:15.910 --> 20:19.270
I don't know, Seth. With great power
comes great responsibility.

20:19.350 --> 20:21.830
Yes, oh, thank you. Listen to me.

20:21.950 --> 20:24.430
It's going to be like no one ever peed
in the bathrooms ever.

20:24.510 --> 20:27.750
Okay, the only other thing,
though, is I kind of need an advance.

20:27.950 --> 20:30.630
Well, you're lucky today was payday.

20:34.670 --> 20:39.950
Hey, Alex, should I be getting dressed
or are we going back to... bed?

20:41.230 --> 20:43.270
Oh... my... God.

20:43.350 --> 20:46.230
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

20:49.750 --> 20:54.070
Let me get this straight.
You broke up with me for Marissa.

20:54.150 --> 20:55.110
Do you want your money?

20:55.110 --> 20:59.110
Hey, who better than a superhero
understands secret identity.

20:59.310 --> 21:02.030
Now hold on. I just want
to make sure I have the visual.

21:02.870 --> 21:07.430
Okay, I got it, great. Thank you.
Hey, listen, Alex. Thank you.

21:07.790 --> 21:12.430
Both of you, for everything. I mean,
keep doing what you're doing. I like it.

21:21.150 --> 21:25.790
So what'll it be,
Ding Dongs or cheese sticks?

21:26.070 --> 21:29.870
Well, this is a dessert wine,
so I'd say Ding Dongs, of course.

21:29.950 --> 21:33.390
Oh, really?
Well, this is one classy picnic.

21:34.870 --> 21:41.630
We got washed-out road,
rainstorm, cheap motel...

21:41.870 --> 21:42.990
Cheap wine.

21:43.910 --> 21:45.750
Has all the makings
of a great slasher movie.

21:45.950 --> 21:49.470
- Getting stuck here overnight?
- Well, that's El Nino for you.

21:50.630 --> 21:57.190
Or fate. Here we are all alone,
no one knows where we are.

21:59.310 --> 22:01.230
It's like nothing else exists.

22:03.270 --> 22:08.030
Tomorrow we head back to reality,
but for now it's just us.

22:09.830 --> 22:17.110
Except it's not just us.
It hasn't been just us for 20 years.

22:27.110 --> 22:31.070
I got to call Kirsten... say goodnight.

22:53.910 --> 22:56.150
I appreciate you selling me
my boat back.

22:56.390 --> 23:01.350
When I sold it, I was in desperate
straits. Low blood sugar, no snacks.

23:01.790 --> 23:04.830
Listen, just a heads up.
I made some modifications to her.

23:04.910 --> 23:09.670
Modifications, terrific. That's very Melville
of you, referring to the boat as a she.

23:16.350 --> 23:19.790
Dear God. She's a slut.

23:30.334 --> 23:32.494
- Hello?
- Hey, honey.

23:34.974 --> 23:38.094
- I tried you last night.
- I got your messages.

23:38.214 --> 23:41.014
I, uh, I passed out early.
It was a long day at the office.

23:42.694 --> 23:44.934
Well, I was hoping the rain
would have stopped by now,

23:44.974 --> 23:47.694
and then they said
that the road opened up, but...

23:47.854 --> 23:51.334
Right. The conveniently washed out road.

23:53.054 --> 23:56.814
Believe me when I tell you--
I'm walking home if I have to.

24:02.574 --> 24:06.174
Just get home. One way or the other.

24:08.254 --> 24:09.934
I'll see you soon.

24:22.854 --> 24:24.974
- You got a minute?
- Not really.

24:25.734 --> 24:28.814
Well, I would like to talk to you
about your friend Alex.

24:28.934 --> 24:31.214
- I'm sure you would, Mom.
- Look, Marissa.

24:31.374 --> 24:33.374
I experimented, too, when I was your age.

24:33.694 --> 24:36.134
Albeit it involved a little Motley Crue
and a lot of Jager.

24:36.254 --> 24:38.214
Whoa, way too much information.

24:38.294 --> 24:42.094
I'm just saying I understand
that this is a phase,

24:42.214 --> 24:45.134
but I won't make a big deal
out of it if you don't.

24:45.254 --> 24:48.414
Right. This way you avoid
any public embarrassment.

24:51.494 --> 24:54.654
- Where are you going?
- I'm moving out.

24:54.734 --> 24:55.334
What?

24:55.374 --> 24:58.734
You have my cell if Caleb kicks and you
need help counting your cash.

25:06.174 --> 25:08.254
- So what's the plan here?
- We get the boat in the pool.

25:08.374 --> 25:11.094
I get Summer to come over. Voilà.

25:11.734 --> 25:14.494
You take Summer for a spin
in the pool in the Gimme Sex.

25:14.894 --> 25:16.494
It's a symbolic gesture, Ryan,

25:16.494 --> 25:19.814
and one that will get Summer
to fall back in love with me, okay?

25:19.934 --> 25:25.494
Oh, by the way-- our exes... are dating
each other now.

25:28.214 --> 25:30.974
Marissa and Alex-- no longer
welcome in the red states.

25:31.574 --> 25:33.214
That I wouldn't have predicted.

25:35.654 --> 25:39.654
- Think it's for real?
- God, I hope so. I just want them to...

25:44.654 --> 25:47.094
I'm not even going to ask why
there's a boat in the living room.

25:47.174 --> 25:50.614
It's an objective correlative, Mother.
I'm getting Summer back.

25:51.814 --> 25:54.974
Lindsay called. The tests are back.
She wants us to go with her.

25:56.014 --> 25:59.654
So this is it, right? There's not another
room full of Samsonite somewhere?

25:59.774 --> 26:01.534
I promise. Thank you.

26:01.814 --> 26:05.374
Ooh, you know what? I forgot
Princess Sparkle. I can't go without her.

26:05.894 --> 26:08.774
As long as you leave her stable,
I'll meet you in the car.

26:18.414 --> 26:20.214
- Hello?
- Hey, Summer, it's me.

26:20.334 --> 26:23.254
- Why am I not surprised?
- So, uh, what are you doing?

26:23.334 --> 26:25.814
Gee, don't know, leaving
for the airport to go to Italy.

26:25.894 --> 26:28.694
Listen to me. Summer, I have something
I want to show you, okay?

26:28.774 --> 26:30.094
And not in a creepy way.

26:30.174 --> 26:31.574
Cohen, what you're selling,
I ain't buying.

26:31.774 --> 26:37.494
Okay, Summer. Before you get on that plane,
I need you to give me one last shot, okay?

26:37.574 --> 26:41.374
You had your shot. Remember when we
were dating and you sailed away?

26:41.454 --> 26:42.654
That's what I want to talk to you about.

26:42.654 --> 26:46.134
No. You have no right to do this to me.
Not now. Okay? I'm hanging up.

26:46.134 --> 26:47.934
Okay, then just tell me this...

26:51.334 --> 26:56.494
I mean, when you're with him, is it...
is it like what we had?

26:57.094 --> 26:59.854
You know, I can't remember
that far back,

26:59.934 --> 27:03.534
and clearly, Cohen, what we had, it wasn't
as awesome as what you had with Ryan.

27:03.534 --> 27:06.494
Otherwise you wouldn't have left.
So you know what, now I'm leaving you.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.494
Summer, will you please...

27:30.214 --> 27:32.894
Someone please say something?

27:34.174 --> 27:38.854
There's a lot, been a lot of rain, lately.
It's nice to see you /
Yeah, it's nice to see you, too.

27:39.334 --> 27:42.694
Yeah, I-I feel... much more relaxed.

27:42.814 --> 27:46.374
Lindsay, no matter what happens,
you'll always be a part of the family.

27:46.974 --> 27:49.054
I couldn't have said it better myself.

27:51.134 --> 27:53.854
Hello. Thank you for waiting.

27:54.574 --> 28:01.574
Our results... demonstrate...
we have a match.

28:01.694 --> 28:04.574
Caleb Nichol is the father
of Lindsay Wheeler Gardner.

28:04.894 --> 28:07.814
I knew you were my daughter.

28:26.654 --> 28:30.334
Boyz II Men, huh?
Guess it didn't go well.

28:30.494 --> 28:32.374
I just hope they get
the sex over with early.

28:32.494 --> 28:36.414
Like, just join the Mile High Club
over the Atlantic or something.

28:36.534 --> 28:39.454
- I'm sorry, man.
- What happened with Lindsay?

28:39.574 --> 28:42.534
- She's Caleb's daughter.
- Hey, that's great.

28:44.294 --> 28:46.934
- Wait. I don't know. Is it?
- She's moving in with him.

28:47.374 --> 28:49.014
She went home to talk
everything over with her mom.

28:49.014 --> 28:50.974
You want, you want to help move her,
get your mind off Summer?

28:51.054 --> 28:55.694
Ah, the schlepping of heavy things.
Comfort for the weary soul. I'll pass.

28:55.774 --> 28:57.974
- Well, you can't sit here and mope.
- No, I know. I've got a plan.

28:57.974 --> 28:59.774
Got the satellite fired up.

28:59.854 --> 29:02.534
They're showing a marathon
of Sherman Oaks, the Real Valley. So...

29:02.614 --> 29:03.254
What's that?

29:03.254 --> 29:07.374
Mm. Apparently The Valley, it's got its
own reality show knockoff, and, you know,

29:07.374 --> 29:12.014
why watch the angst of fictional characters when
you can watch real people in contrived situations?

29:12.414 --> 29:16.894
Could you turn, the music up on your
way out, please? Thanks.

29:28.774 --> 29:32.454
Oh, lay off your brakes.
Can't anyone drive in this weather?

29:32.894 --> 29:35.374
Sandy, relax. Please.

29:40.654 --> 29:41.814
Can we talk about last night?

29:42.014 --> 29:46.174
No, we've got nothing to talk about,
other than your case and this traffic.

29:46.814 --> 29:50.774
- So what we had meant nothing?
- It meant everything to me then.

29:53.294 --> 29:57.174
But that was then. Now I've got a family
that I love and I'm not throwing that away,

29:57.534 --> 30:00.014
and I gotta get back to Newport
and make sure they know that.

30:00.014 --> 30:01.294
- Sandy!
- Whoa!

30:15.599 --> 30:18.999
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think... I think so.

30:20.239 --> 30:22.919
Hey! You guys all right?

30:22.919 --> 30:25.199
Yeah! A little bruised and
battered, but we're okay.

30:25.199 --> 30:30.119
I already called 911! Cops are on
the way, with a tow truck, ambulance...

30:31.159 --> 30:33.679
- All right! Thank you!
- All right!

30:36.039 --> 30:40.039
- What are you doing?
- I can't do this. I gotta go.

30:40.279 --> 30:43.559
The cops are coming. They're going
to arrest me, maybe arrest you.

30:43.639 --> 30:47.039
So we'll talk to them. I'm going
to chalk last night up to fate.

30:47.599 --> 30:51.319
- I've got to do the same here.
- You can't run again.

30:52.399 --> 30:54.359
What choice do I have?

30:57.839 --> 31:01.719
Now my father's gone and
you, I... You're right.

31:02.959 --> 31:05.319
What we had was a long time ago.

31:07.039 --> 31:10.479
I gotta let it go... and let you go.

31:19.039 --> 31:21.199
See you, Sandy Cohen.

31:40.959 --> 31:44.399
So, your father's flight
doesn't leave D.C. until 11:00.

31:44.679 --> 31:46.839
He's lucky he doesn't have
to fly in this weather.

31:48.119 --> 31:49.919
Oh, sorry.

32:00.199 --> 32:04.239
Oh, I'm really excited that I finally get
to meet your dad. He sounds really cool.

32:04.239 --> 32:06.719
Oh, um... did Dad make
reservations at the Uffizi?

32:06.719 --> 32:09.399
Oh, he sure did.
Can't wait to see the Botticellis.

32:09.399 --> 32:11.759
The Birth of Venus is amazing in person.

32:11.759 --> 32:14.479
- Are you a fan of Botticelli?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

32:14.479 --> 32:18.919
Although I prefer his earlier work.
You know, the comedies.

32:22.399 --> 32:26.759
I'm going to go get a magazine. Would you
like People, Us Weekly, In Touch? Anything?

32:26.879 --> 32:30.079
- I could take an Economist.
- I could use a Xanax.

32:45.479 --> 32:48.319
<i>You have one new message.</i>

32:48.479 --> 32:51.239
Hey, it's me.
Look, perhaps you're screening.

32:51.239 --> 32:57.599
Perhaps you're being screened by security.
I just... I just wanted to say...

32:58.799 --> 33:02.599
sorry to leave things like that, okay? And
I hope you have a good trip. I really do.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.919
And somebody else here
wants to say something.

33:09.639 --> 33:14.919
Captain Oats is a horse of few words,
but he said he'd like you to travel safe

33:15.279 --> 33:20.919
and, uh... he said we'll miss you,
so... Okay. Okay. Bye.

33:26.439 --> 33:30.279
- there's no more closet space.
- No. I know. I'm sorry.

33:31.559 --> 33:34.999
It's okay. I can learn
to live with less shoes.

33:35.359 --> 33:38.919
Oh, I got to get to work. Hey, you want
to walk me? I love walking in the rain.

33:38.919 --> 33:39.479
Sure.

33:39.479 --> 33:43.119
Cool. Oh, uh... garbage day is tomorrow.
Do you mind taking out the cans?

33:43.279 --> 33:46.279
And rent is due the first day
of the month.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.519
Okay. Rent.

33:47.599 --> 33:50.439
I know. It's really real, huh?
No turning back.

33:50.719 --> 33:51.759
It's real.

33:52.039 --> 33:54.679
I bet you never did anything
this crazy before.

33:54.919 --> 33:56.479
I'm going to grab my jacket.

34:14.359 --> 34:17.719
- All packed?
- Getting there.

34:17.839 --> 34:19.958
Call Caleb?
Let him know you were coming?

34:21.359 --> 34:22.759
No.

34:26.478 --> 34:27.839
Because I'm not.

34:33.279 --> 34:44.119
Ryan, I talked it over with my mom.
And I want to go with her... to Chicago.

34:46.239 --> 34:47.879
And I thought...

34:49.759 --> 34:52.478
Do I really want to be
Caleb Nichol's daughter?

34:55.159 --> 34:57.279
It's not the life I want.

34:59.799 --> 35:04.679
And, as hard as it is to leave you,
I can't leave my mom.

35:06.599 --> 35:08.999
She's the only family
I've ever really had.

35:10.879 --> 35:12.519
I get it.

35:35.359 --> 35:39.199
Here we go, buddy.
Hours of mind-numbing escapism.

35:44.599 --> 35:48.519
The satellite's out?
Aw...

35:49.479 --> 35:57.519
I refuse to be denied this one
small pleasure. This I can fix.

36:01.999 --> 36:02.719
I need you.

36:02.719 --> 36:04.999
The flight's been delayed a couple
of hours because of the weather.

36:04.999 --> 36:06.799
My sister is having an anxiety attack.

36:06.799 --> 36:07.679
What's the matter?

36:07.679 --> 36:08.759
She's really superstitious,

36:08.759 --> 36:11.919
and she thinks this whole thing is a
sign that she shouldn't marry Rudolpho.

36:11.999 --> 36:14.279
I don't know.
Maybe a girl's point of view?

36:14.639 --> 36:15.719
Sure.

36:43.679 --> 36:44.719
Are you coming?

36:48.799 --> 36:51.959
- I can't do it.
- Okay, I'll talk to her myself.

36:52.079 --> 36:56.719
No. I mean, I can't go. I can't do this.

37:17.239 --> 37:21.839
The truth be told, I didn't think
you'd make it past security.

37:22.519 --> 37:24.439
I'm really sorry.

37:27.199 --> 37:29.199
You can't fight fate.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.639
- You took the bus.
- I told you.

38:10.199 --> 38:12.439
Nothing is keeping me from you.

38:14.399 --> 38:15.919
Is it over?

38:16.879 --> 38:20.199
I promise you, it never started.

39:15.159 --> 39:19.919
Uh... Help? Anyone? Mom?

39:21.159 --> 39:22.519
Thanks for walking me.

39:22.599 --> 39:24.919
Are you sure you don't want to come in?
The band is really, really good.

39:24.919 --> 39:28.319
Oh, no. I should get back. The dishes
aren't going to wash themselves.

39:54.359 --> 39:55.799
Are you okay?

40:30.479 --> 40:34.119
Cohen?
Cohen!

40:34.439 --> 40:39.759
Help! Someone! Anyone!

40:41.159 --> 40:44.159
- Cohen?
- Summer?

40:44.879 --> 40:46.159
Oh, my...

40:47.839 --> 40:51.839
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think, Cohen?

40:52.305 --> 40:58.235
