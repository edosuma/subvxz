00:32.465 --> 00:36.277
<i>So we hide inside
And we lock it up</i>

00:36.436 --> 00:39.815
We lose ourselves
<i>Think</i> we're not enough

00:39.973 --> 00:43.511
<i>There's some Kryptonite
And sometimes we fall</i>

00:43.676 --> 00:47.920

It's true...

01:27.787 --> 01:29.494
- What is it?
- Look out!

01:48.675 --> 01:50.951
Can't catch me, huh?

01:54.047 --> 01:55.583
Ow! Hey!

01:55.748 --> 01:57.386
- Oops.
- Sorry, Supergirl.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.559
Pow! Blaster success.

01:59.719 --> 02:01.630
Intergalactic Games, here we come!

02:01.788 --> 02:03.495
They might as well give us
the gold medal now,

02:03.656 --> 02:06.660
'cause the Batgirl
and Bumblebee battle bots are the bomb.

02:06.826 --> 02:08.133
Nice work.

02:10.430 --> 02:11.431
Help us!

02:11.931 --> 02:13.410
There's trouble in Metropolis.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.141
Sound the "Save the day" alarm.

02:15.935 --> 02:16.936
Come on, girls.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.424
I'm sorry for yelling at you
about breaking our window.

02:27.580 --> 02:30.060
I... I should have known
the customer's always right.

02:30.216 --> 02:31.695
<i>Initiate protocol.</i>

02:31.885 --> 02:32.989
Crush human.

02:35.788 --> 02:37.790
Over here, you hunk of hardware.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.773
Stay here, Steve. You'll be safe.

02:45.031 --> 02:46.374
Thanks, Supergirl.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.020
Oh. Major wreckage.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.555
We heard the "Save the day" alarm.

02:59.712 --> 03:01.749
What's going on?

03:04.817 --> 03:05.852
Robots.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.964
You shall not do that
on the watch that is mine.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.046
<i>I will crush Wonder Woman.</i>

03:24.204 --> 03:25.842
Bring it.

03:27.473 --> 03:29.749
Just a sec. Gotta take this.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.150
<i>- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, princess. How are you?</i>

03:32.378 --> 03:34.289
Just ducky.

03:38.818 --> 03:39.853
Yeah!

03:42.388 --> 03:43.389
Not yeah.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.462
<i>Have</i> you been studying

03:45.625 --> 03:47.468
<i>the treaties of Themyscira
that I sent you?</i>

03:47.627 --> 03:51.507
Um, well, it's been hectic
preparing for the Intergalactic Games.

03:52.932 --> 03:55.378
<i>Precisely why you should
study the treaties,</i>

03:55.535 --> 03:57.811
<i>to impress the ambassador
during the games.</i>

03:57.971 --> 03:58.972
<i>This is</i> your chance

03:59.138 --> 04:00.617
to get the last spot at the inaugural

04:00.773 --> 04:02.878
<i>Intergalactic Ambassador's Student Summit.</i>

04:03.209 --> 04:05.086
Uh-huh. I know.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.725
I can really learn how to be
a better queen at the summit.

04:11.284 --> 04:12.490
Feel the burn!

04:12.719 --> 04:15.325
<i>Heat vision, approximately 2,000 degrees.</i>

04:15.488 --> 04:16.865
<i>Melting point of Platinum,</i>

04:17.023 --> 04:19.629
3,250 degrees.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.534
<i>Platinum fist velocity,
200 miles per hour.</i>

04:22.695 --> 04:24.072
<i>Supergirl fist velocity,</i>

04:24.230 --> 04:26.267
<i>-168 miles per hour.
- Ow!</i>

04:26.633 --> 04:29.273
<i>All part of Super Hero's
faulty programming.</i>

04:29.435 --> 04:32.882
I am a person.
I don't have programming.

04:33.072 --> 04:35.518
<i>Shame.
Platinum is programmed to protect herself</i>

04:35.675 --> 04:36.881
<i>and preserve her power.</i>

04:37.043 --> 04:40.388
<i>But Supergirl will predictably
save humans above all else.</i>

04:40.546 --> 04:41.752
Help!

04:42.282 --> 04:44.319
- Oh!
- Crush human.

04:44.484 --> 04:45.861
Oh, no!

04:49.155 --> 04:50.190
<i>Thank you!</i>

04:53.293 --> 04:54.567
Okay, Mom. See you.

04:54.727 --> 04:55.797
Off with the heads.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.578
<i>I can... To see games...</i>

05:02.802 --> 05:03.803
MY Phone.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.743
Now I'm really mad.

05:06.105 --> 05:07.516
We have to stop them.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.981
<i>Crush. Crush. Crush.</i>

05:10.376 --> 05:11.411
What shall we do?

05:11.577 --> 05:13.784
Their metal is of the indestructibility.

05:13.946 --> 05:16.984
Starfire's right. Every time
I get a hit in, they just reform.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.661
- That's it!
- A soaked phone?

05:19.819 --> 05:22.197
They're robots.
Their bodies might be tough to crack,

05:22.355 --> 05:23.857
but their technology isn't.

05:24.123 --> 05:25.796
They must be powered by computers.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.733
And magnets scramble computers.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.931
What if we magnetize our vehicles?

05:30.196 --> 05:32.403
Oracle, remote pilot Supergirl's spaceship

05:32.565 --> 05:33.805
to these coordinates.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.479
<i>As you wish, Batgirl.</i>

05:46.979 --> 05:49.050
I outfitted Supergirl's spaceship
and my Batjet

05:49.215 --> 05:51.161
with electromagnetic pulse blasters.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.728
It'll totally shut them down.

05:52.985 --> 05:54.521
Wonder Woman, you're up.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.900
<i>Error! Return Lead to ground.</i>

06:02.462 --> 06:03.600
I'm locked on the target.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.069
Now, zap him!

06:11.504 --> 06:13.006
<i>Return Lead...</i>

06:26.119 --> 06:29.623
<i>We bring another of the robotic beings
for your scramblification.</i>

06:29.989 --> 06:32.367
This is what I call pumping iron.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.243
<i>Return Lead and Iron to me,</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:49.580
<i>or the human shall be destroyed.</i>

06:49.909 --> 06:52.788
- Help!
- Steve!

06:52.945 --> 06:56.154
Supergirl, stick with the plan.
Magnetizer on three.

06:56.616 --> 06:58.095
<i>One, two...</i>

06:59.018 --> 07:01.658
Time's up.

07:08.127 --> 07:09.231
Huh?

07:21.374 --> 07:22.978
<i>An experiment?</i>

07:23.209 --> 07:24.654
Uh, that was a malfunction.

07:24.811 --> 07:27.052
But I've made real strides
with the technology.

07:27.213 --> 07:30.126
Doc Magnus, you made strides
right into trouble central.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.388
I can't have teachers
building evil robots.

07:32.552 --> 07:35.192
Especially not now, with all
the scrutiny around the games.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.389
But, Principal Waller--

07:36.556 --> 07:40.333
Our student tech committee will decide
what to do with these experiments.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.168
I don't know, Doc.

07:43.362 --> 07:46.070
It's like it's got a high-powered
wicked chip in there.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.413
But this technology
could change the world.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.980
Look, I call it the Responsometer.

07:52.171 --> 07:53.275
Once I work out the kinks,

07:53.439 --> 07:56.283
it'll be the greatest advancement
in robotics in the galaxy.

07:56.442 --> 07:58.183
Hmm... What does it do?

07:58.344 --> 08:00.688
It makes robots more human.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.050
Gives them free will.

08:02.281 --> 08:03.783
We know the robots are powerful.

08:04.016 --> 08:06.758
Today proved that they can stand up to
some of the toughest heroes.

08:06.919 --> 08:09.695
I got that loud and clear
when they tried to take down my friends.

08:09.856 --> 08:12.700
But what if they were
fighting villains instead?

08:12.859 --> 08:17.205
If the robots could make good choices,
then they could be Super Heroes.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.431
Overnight we could double,

08:18.598 --> 08:20.407
triple the number of
certified Super Heroes

08:20.566 --> 08:23.240
and stop evil worldwide.

08:23.536 --> 08:24.640
What do you think?

08:33.246 --> 08:34.589
These robots are corrupt.

08:34.914 --> 08:35.914
We should destroy them.

08:36.148 --> 08:37.592
- Batgirl knows best.
- She's right.

08:37.750 --> 08:38.888
Yeah. Destroy them.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.587
Principal Waller,
I wanted to let you know that

08:40.753 --> 08:42.061
I've increased the Wi-Fi capacity

08:42.221 --> 08:44.201
and we can handle
all the guest for the games.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.358
Thank you, Lena.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.329
Sounds like you're really
on top of all the IT girl duties.

08:49.495 --> 08:51.497
I try. Anything else I can do for you?

08:51.764 --> 08:52.765
Actually. Yes.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.309
These robots need to be
put in the secure disposal.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.072
Yeah. Sure. You got it.

09:08.948 --> 09:10.825
The Responsometer.

09:11.017 --> 09:12.724
What's that got to do with us?

09:12.885 --> 09:15.695
That fool at Super Hero High created it

09:15.855 --> 09:17.459
to make more heroes.

09:17.623 --> 09:21.400
But combine it with
our Apokolipstion robots,

09:21.561 --> 09:25.441
and we'll have
the greatest army ever seen.

09:25.598 --> 09:28.602
- Oh. Wicked.
- Stompa like army!

09:28.768 --> 09:32.648
The Responsometers will
allow them to act on their own.

09:32.805 --> 09:37.777
Spreading our Apokolipstion evil
throughout the galaxy.

09:38.177 --> 09:39.622
We're wanted criminals.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.726
If you think the Female Furies
can just march into Super Hero High

09:42.882 --> 09:45.192
and grab that thing, you're getting dizzy.

09:45.351 --> 09:46.557
Lashina...

09:46.719 --> 09:48.995
Don't forget your place.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.157
Yes, Granny Goodness.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.404
Our ally who sent the photos

09:53.559 --> 09:55.505
has arranged safe passage for us.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.938
Super Hero High will be
forced to welcome us.

09:59.298 --> 10:00.504
Sweetu ms...

10:00.766 --> 10:04.942
This is your chance to get
revenge on that traitor Big Barda.

10:05.237 --> 10:08.548
And give her the punishment she deserves.

10:08.741 --> 10:09.981
Yes.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.152
Furies forever!

10:12.311 --> 10:13.915
Furies forever!

10:14.080 --> 10:15.957
Furies forever!

10:16.482 --> 10:16.615
<i>I'll sing you</i> a <i>song</i>

10:16.616 --> 10:17.993
<i>I'll sing you</i> a <i>song</i>

10:18.150 --> 10:19.720
<i>To swear my allegiance</i>

10:19.885 --> 10:21.455
<i>H! tell you a tale</i>

10:21.621 --> 10:23.294
<i>Of loyalty strong</i>

10:23.456 --> 10:26.665
<i>Forever in battle expanding our homeland</i>

10:26.826 --> 10:27.827
But with-
Oh...

10:27.994 --> 10:30.873
- Oh. Hey, Wonder Woman.
- What are you doing, Big Barda?

10:31.197 --> 10:34.178
Just practicing my villain launch.
Uh, my event for the games, you know.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.539
Not that part.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.106
The singing part.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.509
Uh, it's just some song
from when I was a kid. It...

10:39.672 --> 10:42.016
It helps me focus.
It's one of them ear snakes.

10:42.174 --> 10:44.051
You mean, ear worm?

10:44.210 --> 10:46.349
On Apokolips we call them ear snakes.

10:46.512 --> 10:48.321
'Cause if Granny Goodness
heard you singing,

10:48.481 --> 10:50.188
you'd have rather been bit by a snake.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.029
Well, that's, um...

10:53.419 --> 10:54.625
Nostalgic.

10:55.087 --> 10:56.191
Good luck at the games.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.110
Yes! Hola, Wonder Woman.

11:11.270 --> 11:14.217
Should you need any help in your duties
as head of the games committee,

11:16.375 --> 11:18.321
like enforcing rules or making sure
Korugar Academy isn't cheating,

11:18.511 --> 11:19.512
I'm here for you.

11:19.945 --> 11:20.946
Thanks, Hawkgirl.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.022
<i>Yeah!</i>

11:36.529 --> 11:37.633
You got it.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.369
Is it the time?

11:43.602 --> 11:46.276
- Have they made their arrival?
- Not yet, Starfire.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.318
I made this gift
of the good luck and welcoming.

11:49.475 --> 11:52.115
Do you think it will be
appreciated by my knifster?

11:52.278 --> 11:54.087
Your knifster?

11:54.246 --> 11:56.590
Oh, you mean your sister, Blackfire?

11:56.749 --> 11:59.127
Yes. On Tamaran we say knifster.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.287
It is like your Earth word for sister.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.866
But it means more than
the sharing of the DNA.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.094
The most accurate translation is,

12:06.258 --> 12:09.205
"Girls who have the bond of the eternity."

12:09.361 --> 12:10.704
That's beautiful.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.433
I'm sure Blackfire will love it.

12:12.598 --> 12:15.204
I cannot the wait!

12:20.606 --> 12:24.019
Lena. How are the improvements
on the Hero Ball Stadium coming along?

12:24.176 --> 12:25.553
Good. Great.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.324
Excellent.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.991
There's several new features
that will really up the excitement

12:31.150 --> 12:32.390
during the big game on Friday.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.763
Wow. You've really gone all out
with the randomized floor traps.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.526
And that's not all.

12:38.691 --> 12:41.570
But I can't let our Hero Ball
team captain in on all the surprises.

12:41.727 --> 12:43.138
It wouldn't be fair.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.264
I guess you're right.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.872
- Thanks, Lena.
- Of course. For sure. Anytime.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.115
You can come out now.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.446
Soon...

13:00.613 --> 13:03.093
Soon, my little Kryptomite.

13:03.516 --> 13:04.586
Soon.

13:13.259 --> 13:15.569
This stadium will make a fine venue

13:15.728 --> 13:17.503
for the finale of the games.

13:17.763 --> 13:21.040
Oh! And here is one of our top students.
Wonder Woman.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.108
Ambassador Bek.

13:23.369 --> 13:25.849
I hope the council is pleased
with the preparations.

13:26.071 --> 13:27.106
Very pleased.

13:27.273 --> 13:29.048
We are proud that two superb schools

13:29.208 --> 13:30.619
have made it through the semi-finals

13:30.776 --> 13:32.687
and will be vying for the championship.

13:32.845 --> 13:35.223
Our thanks to the council
for sponsoring the games.

13:35.381 --> 13:36.655
May they work to bring peace

13:36.816 --> 13:39.194
through friendly competition
throughout the galaxy.

13:39.351 --> 13:41.661
And may my fortune be even greater

13:41.854 --> 13:43.731
in that I find the final participant

13:43.889 --> 13:46.597
to attend next week's
exclusive student summit.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.363
Yes! I hope you--.

13:48.794 --> 13:51.035
Korugar! They're early.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.541
He best not be parking on my lawn.

14:12.117 --> 14:13.118
No.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.157
Hurry, everyone!

14:15.821 --> 14:17.459
<i>Get ready for the opening ceremony.</i>

14:17.623 --> 14:18.727
Yeah.

14:33.873 --> 14:38.686
Blackfire will be the overjoyed
to see the garments of Tamaran.

14:44.283 --> 14:45.626
Drones, swarm.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.437
<i>Welcome, Harley fans,</i>

14:56.595 --> 15:00.771
<i>to your Harley Quin-tessentia!
Play by Play by Play</i>

15:00.933 --> 15:03.209
<i>of the opening ceremony</i>

15:03.369 --> 15:06.179
<i>for the Intergalactic Games.</i>

15:06.372 --> 15:09.945
<i>BEAST BOY". Whoa! Here comes the home team
and my personal favs,</i>

15:10.109 --> 15:11.713
<i>Super Hero High.</i>

15:13.279 --> 15:16.158
<i>Oh, don't they look smashing!</i>

15:16.382 --> 15:18.453
Yeah, totally fly.

15:19.685 --> 15:21.460
And now presenting,

15:21.654 --> 15:23.133
Korugar Academy.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.602
<i>Ooh... That rosy ray of fright there</i>

15:31.797 --> 15:34.277
<i>is Headmaster Sinestro.</i>

15:34.566 --> 15:37.274
<i>That guy gives me
the heebie-jeebies.</i>

15:37.436 --> 15:39.916
Okay, everyone. I know we all want to win.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.550
But the ambassador is watching.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.880
So make sure we have good sportsmanship.

15:44.043 --> 15:45.044
- Yeah.
- You got it.

15:45.344 --> 15:46.846
Blackfire. Blackfire.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.490
It is I, your knifster.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.419
Perhaps she did not hear me.

15:52.718 --> 15:54.891
Yeah, uh... Probably not.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.097
Welcome.
We look forward to competing with--

16:01.260 --> 16:03.866
Of course, you do.
Now if your mundanities are complete,

16:04.029 --> 16:06.134
I believe it's time for my speech.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.542
Thank you for hosting us on your

16:10.869 --> 16:11.870
humble planet.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.879
Having coached Korugar Academy to victory

16:15.040 --> 16:16.383
in the past eight games--

16:16.542 --> 16:17.714
Oh, knifster!

16:17.876 --> 16:19.617
Oh, I have missed the you.

16:19.778 --> 16:20.779
Starfire.

16:21.046 --> 16:23.549
You haven't changed. How unfortunate.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.760
I made for you the gift
of the luck that is good.

16:26.919 --> 16:30.492
Luck? We're Korugar Academy.
We don't need luck.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.727
Only students with
the greatest superpowers are accepted.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.805
Not like your school,
which lets in mere mortals.

16:37.029 --> 16:38.508
Like that one.

16:38.797 --> 16:40.140
- Me?
- Am I mistaken?

16:40.366 --> 16:41.640
Do you have super speed?

16:41.834 --> 16:42.835
Super strength?

16:43.168 --> 16:44.306
Can you fly?

16:44.737 --> 16:45.943
Well... No.

16:46.105 --> 16:50.212
See? The only thing she's super at
is being super boring.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.447
But Batgirl is the friend of mine.

16:52.611 --> 16:54.352
Then maybe you should give this to her.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.657
Super Hero High will need
all the luck it can get.

17:00.652 --> 17:01.995
Oops.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.063
Let the games begin!

17:24.376 --> 17:25.480
Uh, Oh!

17:25.711 --> 17:27.054
The Female Furies.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.919
And they're on my lawn.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.253
Granny Goodness.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.189
Please, supers.

17:32.351 --> 17:35.230
We come seeking only peace.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.526
The same peace that the ambassadors wished

17:37.689 --> 17:39.760
<i>to achieve with these games.</i>

17:41.026 --> 17:45.406
Ambassador Garren Bek, I presume.
I am Granny Goodness,

17:45.631 --> 17:48.111
dean of the Apokolips Magnet School.

17:48.367 --> 17:51.246
We received an invitation
from your council.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.814
Ambassador Bek,
don't listen to her nonsense.

17:53.972 --> 17:56.213
Granny Goodness and the Furies
tried to brainwash us.

17:56.375 --> 18:00.016
Amanda, I understand you
are used to running things around here.

18:00.179 --> 18:03.786
But do remember that the games
are the jurisdiction of the council.

18:04.383 --> 18:08.195
Hmm... This does appear official.
It's not the decision that I would make.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.224
But I trust the council has its reasons.

18:11.390 --> 18:15.031
As ambassadors,
it is our mission to promote peace.

18:15.294 --> 18:18.707
Today we uphold that mission
by allowing Apokolips Magnet

18:18.864 --> 18:20.810
<i>- to join the championships.</i>

18:21.066 --> 18:22.477
This isn't gonna be good.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.011
Amp up security.

18:24.169 --> 18:26.149
I'll install fingerprint readers
on every door.

18:26.305 --> 18:28.808
The school will be accessible
only by our students.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.477
Good. Those Furies are up to something.

18:31.643 --> 18:33.316
Now, we feast!

18:33.912 --> 18:36.688
- Come along, competitors.
- Come on, team.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.851
As long as they uphold
their promise of peace,

18:39.017 --> 18:40.690
we should give them peace in return.

18:40.886 --> 18:44.197
- Well put, future ambassador.
- But we still wanna win, right?

18:44.389 --> 18:45.390
More than ever.

18:45.591 --> 18:47.127
Super Hero High!

18:47.292 --> 18:48.828
Super Hero High!

18:48.994 --> 18:50.439
Super Hero High!

18:50.596 --> 18:52.041
Super Hero High!

18:52.197 --> 18:55.110
<i>Super Hero High! Super Hero High!</i>

18:55.567 --> 18:59.379
Don't you just love the smell
of impending doom?

19:00.939 --> 19:01.940
Oh...

19:02.174 --> 19:04.620
Feels so good to let my hair down.

19:08.213 --> 19:10.056
Wrench.

19:16.288 --> 19:17.358
Not yet.

19:17.589 --> 19:20.468
You need to keep that mischief
bottled up inside until Friday.

19:20.692 --> 19:21.693
<i>Um-kay?</i>

19:33.172 --> 19:34.173
<i>Rebooting.</i>

19:34.339 --> 19:35.443
<i>Thank you, master.</i>

19:35.607 --> 19:37.678
Master? Indeed.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.187
But we're in undercover mode, so call me

19:40.479 --> 19:41.480
Lena.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.519
<i>Lena Thurol.</i>

19:43.682 --> 19:46.686
<i>Employed by Super Hero High School
as IT specialist.</i>

19:46.885 --> 19:48.193
<i>No criminal record.</i>

19:50.989 --> 19:53.026
You're a riot, Platinum.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.565
That's what I hacked
the school computer to say.

19:55.727 --> 19:57.001
But between you and me,

19:57.162 --> 19:59.904
Thurol isn't really my last name.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.401
<i>I am programmed to keep secrets.</i>

20:02.634 --> 20:03.704
Yes! Great.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.281
Do as you're programmed
and everything will be super.

20:06.471 --> 20:07.472
Or rather...

20:07.673 --> 20:09.380
Unsuper.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.382
- See what I did there?
- Good one.

20:25.357 --> 20:26.495
- Wow.
- Hi.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.768
-it's amazing.
- Amazing.

20:38.403 --> 20:39.677
Hi!

20:47.012 --> 20:50.186
Now, as you say on Earth,

20:50.749 --> 20:51.750
dig in.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.525
Oh, it looks so good, you guys.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.934
Big Barda, we saved you a seat.

21:05.964 --> 21:09.878
Once a Fury, forever a Fury. Right?

21:10.769 --> 21:13.716
Ignore them.
They're using known tactics to anger you.

21:13.905 --> 21:15.145
Right.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.213
Thanks, Lady Shiva.

21:18.543 --> 21:21.353
Lashina, don't be
so upset about Big Barda.

21:21.513 --> 21:23.424
She has new friends now.

21:23.582 --> 21:26.961
And she'll probably
leave them in the lurch, like she left us.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.565
Stompa no like lurch.

21:30.856 --> 21:32.199
It wasn't a lurch.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.064
It was juvenile detention.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.570
We were doing our time,
'cause we did the crime.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.537
But you didn't do your time.

21:38.697 --> 21:41.007
You betrayed us to get out of there.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.012
I gotta give you credit.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.978
This gone good thing is
one of your bestest tricks.

22:26.878 --> 22:28.516
And I said, "Guano?

22:28.747 --> 22:31.387
"Well, I'm guano take you to Belle Reve."

22:36.621 --> 22:37.622
Where are you going?

22:37.923 --> 22:40.995
I must see if this gala's
to Blackfire's enjoyment.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.400
Really? But she's...

22:44.096 --> 22:46.235
Well, "mean" is putting it mildly.

22:46.398 --> 22:47.706
Why do you keep trying with her?

22:47.933 --> 22:49.674
Blackfire has been mean.

22:50.001 --> 22:53.539
But she has also been
sweeter than the pie of the Gorka berries.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.818
I must give her another chance.

22:59.578 --> 23:02.184
Hello, knifster. Is this seat taken?

23:02.647 --> 23:04.490
Sadly, no.

23:05.717 --> 23:08.857
I do not know why you're
so upward set with me.

23:09.187 --> 23:10.928
Have I done something to offend you?

23:11.256 --> 23:12.792
Yeah. Actually,

23:12.958 --> 23:15.461
your whole Super Hero
lifestyle offends me.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.900
We're princesses of Tamaran.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.373
I shouldn't have to endure
the thought of my sister

23:20.532 --> 23:23.240
lowering herself to help humans.

23:23.468 --> 23:24.469
Squik.

23:24.803 --> 23:26.714
I am sorry for your distress.

23:27.172 --> 23:28.549
If you were really sorry,

23:28.707 --> 23:31.745
you'd drop Super Hero High
and come to Korugar,

23:31.910 --> 23:33.617
where you can learn
how to use your superpowers

23:33.779 --> 23:36.089
to bring glory to yourself and our family.

23:36.448 --> 23:39.088
Don't you wanna be the best
you can be for our family?

23:39.651 --> 23:40.721
Our planet?

23:41.219 --> 23:42.823
Yes. You're right.

23:43.121 --> 23:46.432
If Korugar wins the games and
proves they're truly the best,

23:46.691 --> 23:48.398
I shall do as you ask.

23:49.127 --> 23:50.401
- Deal.
- But...

23:50.562 --> 23:54.806
If Super Hero High is the victorious,
then you shall do what I wish.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.271
What's that?

23:56.501 --> 23:57.844
You will answer my calls

23:58.003 --> 24:00.483
and make responses to my e-messages.

24:00.639 --> 24:04.018
And like my updates
of status on the social medias.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.621
Plus, you shall spend with me
a day of funship.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.220
Day of funship?

24:09.381 --> 24:13.056
Twenty-four hours
of the togetherness of the knifsters.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.424
There's no way we'll lose.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.963
So, you got yourself a deal.

24:25.730 --> 24:26.970
Wonderful.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.821
EW. Who did that?

24:50.555 --> 24:52.831
Uber hilarious story, Hawkgirl.

24:53.058 --> 24:55.265
<i>Kenna.</i>

24:57.929 --> 24:59.272
Whoops.

25:03.802 --> 25:06.715
Food fight!

25:07.172 --> 25:08.310
Food fight!

25:30.896 --> 25:34.400
Korugar? More like Snorugar. Booyah!

25:38.136 --> 25:40.878
Put that pie from the sky in my tum-tum.

25:44.509 --> 25:45.783
Bombs away.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.485
Ew. Ew. Ew!

25:55.487 --> 25:56.693
Oh, cease!

25:57.088 --> 25:58.761
Stop it this instant.

26:02.027 --> 26:04.769
Croc's sake. You're breaking the peace.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.669
Get behind me.

26:08.900 --> 26:12.279
Ew. Guess my bracelets
are just bulletproof.

26:12.470 --> 26:13.949
Not borscht-proof.

26:14.105 --> 26:15.482
Want some mashed potatoes?

26:20.478 --> 26:22.788
It's okay, Ambassador. I got this.

26:24.282 --> 26:25.727
Hey! Everyone!

26:26.084 --> 26:27.620
Stop. Please!

26:33.291 --> 26:34.292
Oh.

26:35.460 --> 26:36.461
Supergirl.

26:36.695 --> 26:38.641
Supergirl?

26:42.233 --> 26:44.577
- Kryptomite.
- Uh-oh.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.890
Wonder Woman, I found a Kryptomite.

26:55.046 --> 26:57.117
I need some of Frost and lvy's anti-K mix.

26:59.351 --> 27:00.352
I'm on it.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.260
Excuse me.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.066
It's hero time.

27:04.422 --> 27:06.834
If you please, ladies.

27:12.897 --> 27:13.898
Huh?

27:16.601 --> 27:18.274
I lost it.

27:19.537 --> 27:20.607
I can help.

27:29.981 --> 27:31.119
What are you doing here?

27:31.416 --> 27:33.259
If you get too close to it,
it can hurt you.

27:33.418 --> 27:34.556
I don't have to get close.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.162
I just have to find it.

27:39.290 --> 27:40.291
In there.

27:49.634 --> 27:51.204
We have the anti-K.

27:53.471 --> 27:55.041
Nighty night, Kryptomite.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.882
- Yes!
- Cool.

27:59.377 --> 28:00.378
Good.

28:01.046 --> 28:02.855
Gooey but good.

28:11.923 --> 28:15.427
Royal rule of peacekeeping number six.
Create a distraction.

28:16.561 --> 28:17.562
<i>A microphone.</i>

28:18.930 --> 28:22.173
- Bumblebee, I need feedback.
- Right now?

28:22.333 --> 28:24.973
Uh... I think you're doing a great job?

28:25.170 --> 28:27.343
Not like that. Over the speakers.

28:27.572 --> 28:30.246
- Get the <i>mic.</i>
- Oh, I can do that.

28:42.353 --> 28:43.764
OW!

28:45.190 --> 28:47.670
Ow! My ears!

28:48.760 --> 28:52.071
Oh, my precious ears.

28:58.103 --> 29:01.516
Students.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

29:01.973 --> 29:04.419
If that kind of nonsense happens again,

29:04.709 --> 29:06.746
I will cancel the games.

29:08.379 --> 29:12.088
Now, go to your rooms
and prepare for tomorrow's competition.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.162
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely not!

29:19.357 --> 29:20.802
I have garlic in my eye.

29:21.826 --> 29:25.239
I expected more from you.

29:26.798 --> 29:27.970
You did great.

29:28.199 --> 29:30.679
Don't let old grumpy garlic guy
get to you.

29:31.236 --> 29:32.772
- Thanks.
- You still hungry?

29:32.937 --> 29:34.348
I got plenty of leftovers.

29:41.646 --> 29:42.681
Another Kryptomite?

29:42.847 --> 29:45.054
I thought we cleared those things
out of Metropolis.

29:45.350 --> 29:46.590
Looks like we missed one.

29:46.851 --> 29:50.060
Luckily, the anti-K works
like a charm to deactivate it.

29:50.321 --> 29:53.564
Frost, Ivy, make sure we have
plenty of your solution ready.

29:53.725 --> 29:56.501
There may be a few more
of these monsters hiding out there.

30:13.411 --> 30:16.392
Precious.
All my baby Kryptomites in a row.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.186
I am so glad I figured out how to build

30:18.349 --> 30:20.989
you cute little butterballs
of destruction.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.958
Oh, no!

30:25.824 --> 30:29.101
Platinum, have you analyzed the
footage and their fighting techniques?

30:29.260 --> 30:33.174
<i>Yes. But I do not understand
the reason for the many strange deviations</i>

30:33.331 --> 30:35.368
<i>in the behavior
of Super Hero High students</i>

30:35.533 --> 30:37.342
<i>in comparison to the normal human.</i>

30:37.535 --> 30:39.879
<i>They act strangely for no reason.</i>

30:40.071 --> 30:43.177
The reason for that
is what they call heroism.

30:43.641 --> 30:46.451
Yuck! Gross.

31:01.192 --> 31:04.435
<i>This is Lois Lane reporting
live from the Intergalactic Games.</i>

31:04.596 --> 31:05.597
<i>Beat it, girly!</i>

31:06.064 --> 31:08.442
It's the Harley Quinn show now!

31:08.967 --> 31:11.607
Howdy, Harleirinos! Harley here.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.579
<i>And we have more games coming up
than a centipede': got legs.</i>

31:15.907 --> 31:18.513
<i>Whoa! That's a lot of games, yo!</i>

31:42.567 --> 31:45.514
<i>Flash clobbers the competition
in the Super Speed Sprint.</i>

31:54.545 --> 31:58.186
<i>Lashina gets a sweet 8.2
in the long distance whip.</i>

31:58.349 --> 31:59.987
Ha! Meas! y.

32:00.218 --> 32:01.697
Beat that, Pansy.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.093
Actually, the name's Ivy.

32:19.504 --> 32:22.007
<i>That's what's up! A perfect 10 for Ivy.</i>

32:22.573 --> 32:26.043
<i>Yeah! That's my green thumb girl!
Getting the gold!</i>

32:32.984 --> 32:37.899
<i>Yeah! Katana is a cut above Mad Harriet
in the weapons round.</i>

32:55.006 --> 32:56.349
Who's that?

32:58.943 --> 33:01.981
Maxima goes
for maximum winage <i>in</i> the skeet shoot.

33:09.887 --> 33:11.764
My ankle!

33:36.247 --> 33:38.750
<i>Stompa's win
in the hand-to-hand combat round</i>

33:38.916 --> 33:40.918
<i>is a real smack down!</i>

33:41.085 --> 33:42.758
<i>And I'm not kiddin'!</i>

33:42.987 --> 33:45.092
Somebody called for a kitten?

33:48.026 --> 33:49.937
Better say goodbye to your pals now.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.468
Korugar has this in the bag.

33:54.298 --> 33:55.777
The gulp-

34:17.789 --> 34:20.326
<i>Wondy kicks the competition
right in the kisser</i>

34:20.558 --> 34:22.731
<i>in</i> the aerial obstacle race.

34:25.063 --> 34:28.237
<i>I'll sing you</i> a <i>song
to swear my allegiance</i>

34:28.666 --> 34:31.612
<i>H! tell you a tale of loyalty strong</i>

34:32.003 --> 34:35.313
<i>Forever in battle expanding our homeland</i>

34:35.473 --> 34:39.114
<i>It's with you by my side
I know I belong</i>

34:39.944 --> 34:42.150
Lashina! What are you doing here?

34:42.413 --> 34:43.414
I heard you singing.

34:44.114 --> 34:45.822
Thought you must have been reminiscing.

34:46.350 --> 34:47.454
That song gets stuck in my head.

34:48.152 --> 34:49.290
It was always my favorite.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.498
Remember how you used to
have those nightmares?

34:52.790 --> 34:55.429
It was bad news
if your crying woke Granny.

34:55.893 --> 34:58.203
I'd sing to you until you went to sleep.

34:58.496 --> 34:59.907
I almost forgot about that.

35:00.598 --> 35:03.545
Probably better that way.
Now that we're enemies.

35:04.035 --> 35:06.015
Well, we don't have to be enemies.

35:06.170 --> 35:07.911
You'll come back to the Furies?

35:08.439 --> 35:10.612
No. I'll never do that.

35:11.676 --> 35:14.589
But you guys could go good.
Break off from Darkseid.

35:14.745 --> 35:16.554
I'm sure Super Hero High
would take you in.

35:17.882 --> 35:18.952
You.

35:19.317 --> 35:21.319
You were always a wishful thinker.

35:21.552 --> 35:23.463
I made an oath to the Furies.

35:23.821 --> 35:25.198
Forever.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.235
But as long as we are here for the games,
let's get along.

35:30.661 --> 35:31.662
For old time's sake?

35:32.130 --> 35:33.632
Yeah!

35:34.132 --> 35:35.702
Thanks for stopping by, Lashina.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.378
The fingerprints
weren't a problem.

35:39.604 --> 35:43.211
Fed her a sob story
about that stupid song she always sings.

35:44.509 --> 35:47.649
Big Barda has always been
a sentimental fool.

35:48.112 --> 35:52.288
What a perfect punishment it will be
for her to know that she is to blame

35:52.450 --> 35:56.694
for the Furies acquiring
the Universe Destruction Technology.

35:59.390 --> 36:00.733
None of these will do.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.566
We'll have to get you
a whole new wardrobe on Korugar.

36:03.728 --> 36:05.469
But the winner's not decided.

36:05.630 --> 36:08.907
We still have the game of the Hero Ball,
the Battle Bots,

36:09.066 --> 36:10.511
and the partner biathlon.

36:10.902 --> 36:15.009
You really think you and Supergirl
can beat me and Bleez in the biathlon?

36:15.273 --> 36:16.775
Please.

36:17.008 --> 36:20.649
Supergirl and I have trained and refined
the strategy of the partnership.

36:20.978 --> 36:21.979
And...

36:22.547 --> 36:25.892
Go on, tell me all about your strategy.

36:27.285 --> 36:28.764
I am only the saying,

36:28.986 --> 36:30.966
should Super Hero High prevail,

36:31.122 --> 36:34.228
I am very much looking forward
to our day of funship.

36:34.492 --> 36:36.802
We could watch
the lake chicken at the park.

36:36.961 --> 36:40.272
And eat of the ice cream
until our brain is freezing.

36:40.464 --> 36:42.740
Ugh! Squik.

37:00.051 --> 37:03.089
Pow! Battle Bot on!
How about you, partner?

37:03.454 --> 37:05.491
Ready to kick some robot butt.

37:07.091 --> 37:09.162
<i>Suspicious activity in Sector H.</i>

37:13.531 --> 37:16.137
You won't need to bring
any of this to Korugar.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.301
It's all junk.

37:18.169 --> 37:19.773
This is not the junk.

37:20.137 --> 37:23.016
Don't you remember
the great laughs of the hilarity we had

37:23.174 --> 37:25.017
this day at the Tamaran Zoo?

37:25.176 --> 37:27.156
I remember being embarrassed
by your wailing

37:27.311 --> 37:29.188
when you fell into the Polka Hoozy pen.

37:29.714 --> 37:31.318
<i>Girls? We got trouble.</i>

37:31.482 --> 37:34.895
Blackfire.
Join me in the mission of saving the day.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.087
Yeah, right.

37:37.455 --> 37:39.833
Have fun being a Super Zero.

37:40.391 --> 37:42.302
See you tomorrow, knifster.

37:55.906 --> 37:57.749
Find that Responsometer!

38:08.486 --> 38:10.659
Stompa find pretty.

38:11.489 --> 38:12.490
Yes.

38:13.157 --> 38:14.568
Put that down!

38:19.063 --> 38:20.064
Furies!

38:20.398 --> 38:22.400
Finish these supers!

38:25.736 --> 38:26.806
Hey, bUQQY-

38:32.510 --> 38:35.150
I should have finished you off last time.

38:38.182 --> 38:40.287
Look at what Stompa caught.

38:40.584 --> 38:42.461
Can I keep her?

38:53.998 --> 38:55.534
No, Bats.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.071
Oh, no!

39:12.016 --> 39:13.393
Batgirl! Wake up!

39:27.164 --> 39:28.268
Huh?

39:28.966 --> 39:30.673
Not so fast.

39:45.015 --> 39:46.961
Slice and dice.

39:47.318 --> 39:50.390
Good gorka, I am oozing my life goop.

39:50.621 --> 39:52.157
Come on, Furies.

39:56.527 --> 39:59.337
- Hey, Granny.
- Out of my way, Big Barda.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.678
I don't take orders from you anymore.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.012
I make my own choices now.

40:10.741 --> 40:12.186
Can't beat me, Barda.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.851
Bumblebee, sting Speed Queen's skates.

40:15.146 --> 40:16.250
Yeah!

40:22.553 --> 40:25.261
Give it back. Or Batty gets it.

40:26.557 --> 40:28.867
Supergirl, Harley's buggy.

40:39.503 --> 40:41.483
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

40:48.546 --> 40:50.583
Stompa no like lasso!

40:55.419 --> 40:56.489
Come home with us.

40:56.854 --> 40:58.299
You were born a Fury,

40:58.456 --> 41:00.834
<i>and you will always be a Fury.</i>

41:01.725 --> 41:05.036
You're right.
I was born a Fury, but I changed.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.766
I fight for good now.

41:18.209 --> 41:20.553
You did n.

41:20.711 --> 41:22.349
That's one way to use a Mega-Rod.

41:23.981 --> 41:24.982
Good riddance.

41:25.182 --> 41:27.719
The Metropolis Special Crimes unit
will take care of the Furies now.

41:27.885 --> 41:30.058
I do not envy them the papenlvork.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.201
I'm just glad the school is safe again.

41:32.356 --> 41:35.132
Thanks in no small part to your efforts.

41:35.459 --> 41:39.737
Which is why I'd formally like
to invite you to join us next week

41:40.231 --> 41:41.232
for the summit.

41:41.732 --> 41:43.769
Really? Oh, my Hera!

41:43.934 --> 41:46.710
My mom is going to flip her bananas.
Thank you, Ambassador.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.417
I can't believe all that
was over my gadget.

41:50.608 --> 41:53.589
Super Hero High does attract
more than its share of super villains.

41:54.211 --> 41:56.817
I couldn't forgive myself
if this got in the wrong hands.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.491
We should destroy it.

42:02.086 --> 42:04.566
You're right, Doc.
I'll use the secure disposal.

42:04.722 --> 42:06.463
It will be gone for good after that.

42:32.816 --> 42:36.127
Coast <i>is</i> clear.

42:39.557 --> 42:39.756
Letting the Furies do the hard work
for <i>us</i> was a <i>nice</i> stroke.

42:39.757 --> 42:42.863
Letting the Furies do the hard work
for <i>us</i> was a <i>nice</i> stroke.

42:43.327 --> 42:47.173
A tip off to Batgirl's security system
and bang, bang, bing, bang!

42:47.631 --> 42:50.840
The Furies are out
and the Responsometer is ours.

42:51.101 --> 42:54.105
The army <i>is</i> 92% complete.

42:54.772 --> 42:57.150
SO cool.

42:57.308 --> 43:00.152
How great am I gonna look
commanding these things?

43:00.311 --> 43:01.756
<i>Very great, Master.</i>

43:01.979 --> 43:03.890
Platinum. I have a treat for you.

43:04.148 --> 43:06.094
You'll be my first Ultrabot.

43:15.259 --> 43:16.397
<i>Whoa!</i>

43:16.760 --> 43:18.865
- How does it feel?
- I feel <i>like...</i>

43:19.630 --> 43:20.665
<i>I feel.</i>

43:21.332 --> 43:23.608
- Whoo-hoo!
- Excellent.

43:23.834 --> 43:27.646
Soon Metropolis will be cured
of its "Super" problem.

43:27.938 --> 43:30.714
Yeah. Good one.

43:34.378 --> 43:35.584
Did you pack enough socks?

43:35.746 --> 43:38.317
- Mom. It's one week.
- You're right.

43:38.649 --> 43:40.094
You'll need more.

43:41.585 --> 43:44.293
I can't believe I am leaving
for the summit right after the games.

43:44.455 --> 43:47.026
I have never been
62 light years from home before.

43:47.257 --> 43:51.034
My little princess is on her way to
becoming a great ambassador,

43:51.295 --> 43:53.104
and an even greater queen.

43:53.330 --> 43:54.536
I am so proud.

43:55.766 --> 43:57.109
Thanks, Mom.

44:00.304 --> 44:04.775
The teams are tied as we get ready
for some heavy metal action!

44:08.812 --> 44:10.587
<i>Not that kinda heavy metal.</i>

44:10.748 --> 44:12.785
<i>It's Team Bot Battle time.</i>

44:13.017 --> 44:17.466
<i>Batgirl and Bumblebee
are facing off against Mangal and Lobo.</i>

44:20.524 --> 44:22.595
Goodness of morning, knifster.

44:22.926 --> 44:23.927
What happened to you?

44:24.395 --> 44:28.241
Oh, it is only the wound of the flesh
from the fight with the Furies last night.

44:28.932 --> 44:30.377
You fought the Furies?

44:30.534 --> 44:31.535
I was not alone.

44:31.835 --> 44:33.872
Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Batgirl--

44:34.038 --> 44:36.541
Batgirl? That non-Super?

44:36.707 --> 44:39.244
Batgirl may not have
the super powers like you,

44:39.410 --> 44:41.686
but she is a true Super Hero.

44:41.845 --> 44:44.724
Blackfire!
The Korugar section is over here.

44:44.882 --> 44:46.623
Of course, Headmaster Sinestro.

44:49.553 --> 44:51.863
You are bothered by your sister's injury?

44:52.022 --> 44:54.024
No way. Of course not.

44:54.191 --> 44:56.831
I was just thinking how much
greater my powers are than hers

44:56.994 --> 44:58.371
since I have been at Korugar.

44:58.796 --> 45:01.640
- Furies wouldn't hurt me.
-Indeed.

45:01.799 --> 45:04.279
But as long as you live
the Korugarian way,

45:04.468 --> 45:06.778
you will never need to take risks.

45:06.937 --> 45:10.714
Your sister was injured
because she fancies herself a Super Hero.

45:10.974 --> 45:12.112
It's abhorrent.

45:12.409 --> 45:14.047
Ag reed, Headmaster.

45:15.713 --> 45:16.714
Let us go.

45:17.147 --> 45:18.683
The whoo and the hoo!

45:21.885 --> 45:23.296
Hey!

45:25.022 --> 45:26.023
<i>WOW!</i>

45:29.193 --> 45:30.433
Yeah, honey!

45:44.041 --> 45:45.714
What? How could she?

45:46.043 --> 45:47.784
<i>- Torn limb from metal limb!</i>

45:48.245 --> 45:50.623
<i>Oh, the humanity!</i>

45:50.781 --> 45:53.227
Did someone <i>call</i> for a manatee?

46:06.263 --> 46:07.333
Oh, no.

46:14.171 --> 46:15.445
<i>LOBO". Bug target confirmed.</i>

46:15.906 --> 46:18.011
Guess who's got auto targeting, twerps.

46:18.175 --> 46:20.086
<i>Nothing can escape my blasters.</i>

46:21.879 --> 46:23.324
Don't worry. I've got this.

46:23.547 --> 46:25.322
Go <i>small</i> or go home.

46:27.518 --> 46:29.657
Huh? Where'd it go?

46:31.021 --> 46:32.932
Let's see you auto target <i>this.</i>

46:39.429 --> 46:43.343
<i>And Super Hero High scores!</i>

46:47.805 --> 46:50.149
- Way to go, Super Hero High.
- Awesome.

46:50.741 --> 46:54.052
- Give to me the highness of the five.
- Oh, yeah.

46:54.211 --> 46:55.315
Than ks, Starfire.

46:59.249 --> 47:00.751
Assembling time.

47:00.918 --> 47:02.920
<i>Destroying the supers will be fun.</i>

47:03.320 --> 47:05.596
<i>Hey! I know what fun is.</i>

47:05.989 --> 47:06.990
<i>Neato.</i>

47:07.191 --> 47:09.364
Yes, it <i>will</i> be loads of <i>fun.</i>

47:09.793 --> 47:11.830
What? How'd you do that?

47:11.995 --> 47:15.067
<i>I was so excited
about our upcoming triumph,</i>

47:15.432 --> 47:18.572
<i>I could hardly remain a secret
whispering in your ear.</i>

47:18.836 --> 47:21.544
<i>Whoa! Whose voice is that?</i>

47:21.738 --> 47:24.981
Uh, just another one of my minions.
Now, back to what's important.

47:28.946 --> 47:32.155
Hello, my babies. Time to play.

47:33.617 --> 47:35.153
<i>Hey, Harleians!</i>

47:35.419 --> 47:36.727
Yowza, yowza, yowza!

47:37.054 --> 47:40.365
<i>What a rally-coaster ride
of games it's been.</i>

47:40.524 --> 47:43.164
<i>It's Super Hero High at 26 wins.</i>

47:43.327 --> 47:45.398
<i>And Korugar with 25.</i>

47:45.562 --> 47:49.305
<i>As wet gettin' ready
for the second to fast event.</i>

47:49.766 --> 47:52.770
<i>If we kick some booty
in the partner biathlon,</i>

47:53.136 --> 47:54.706
<i>the championship is ours.</i>

47:54.938 --> 47:57.111
<i>No way Korugar can overtake us.</i>

47:57.641 --> 48:00.087
You both have super powers by nature.

48:00.544 --> 48:04.492
We won't allow a school that lets
mere mortals masquerade as supers

48:04.748 --> 48:05.852
take our glory.

48:06.116 --> 48:07.720
Yes, Headmaster.

48:11.655 --> 48:12.656
<i>On your marks,</i>

48:13.590 --> 48:14.591
<i>get set...</i>

48:15.092 --> 48:16.435
<i>Go!</i>

48:18.762 --> 48:19.866
Oh, the yes!

48:20.030 --> 48:22.636
Yeah? I got solar power, too, sister.

48:32.175 --> 48:33.745
- Huh?
- Help us! Help us!

48:33.911 --> 48:35.481
- Come on!
- Go, Supergirl!

48:35.646 --> 48:37.091
What is she waiting for?

48:37.247 --> 48:39.386
I have to go.
There's a fire in Metropolis.

48:40.884 --> 48:44.457
Partners in the biathlon.
Partners in the day saving.

48:52.462 --> 48:54.066
See that, Starfire?

48:55.165 --> 48:56.166
Starfire?

49:00.137 --> 49:02.413
There was smoke everywhere.
I couldn't see anything.

49:03.307 --> 49:04.308
Where did they go?

49:04.741 --> 49:06.448
<i>This is highly unorthodox.</i>

49:06.643 --> 49:09.089
- Is that everyone?
- That is all of the citizens.

49:09.246 --> 49:10.486
Then we gotta get back.

49:12.716 --> 49:15.128
<i>Korugar Academy wins the partner biathlon.</i>

49:15.385 --> 49:17.922
<i>The game is a tie. 26 wins to 26 wins.</i>

49:18.989 --> 49:22.994
<i>It's down to the Hero Ball game
to determine the champion.</i>

49:24.561 --> 49:26.131
Congratulations.

49:26.296 --> 49:28.367
- Where did you go?
- To save the people.

49:28.699 --> 49:29.700
There was a fire.

49:29.933 --> 49:33.540
You sacrificed winning the championship
for some humans?

49:33.704 --> 49:34.944
It is just a game.

49:35.105 --> 49:36.516
Principal Waller teaches,

49:36.673 --> 49:39.745
there is no greatness without sacrifice.

49:40.143 --> 49:42.419
- There she is. That's the girl.
- Yay!

49:44.448 --> 49:46.758
Thank you for saving my daddy.

49:47.017 --> 49:48.587
You're my hero.

49:48.885 --> 49:50.489
Mmm.

49:50.954 --> 49:52.831
Thank you.

49:53.290 --> 49:56.794
- Here. Put your nose holes to it.
- But that's yours.

49:57.027 --> 49:59.371
Gifts are best when we share them.

50:15.812 --> 50:16.813
Please welcome,

50:17.014 --> 50:20.223
<i>the reigning Champions
of the intergalactic Games,</i>

50:20.484 --> 50:22.088
<i>Korugar Academy.</i>

50:28.825 --> 50:31.533
<i>And on this side, the challengers,</i>

50:31.695 --> 50:33.572
<i>Super Hero High School.</i>

50:49.312 --> 50:51.883
<i>And now to set the game...</i>

50:52.716 --> 50:54.252
<i>Um, well...</i>

50:54.651 --> 50:57.723
<i>There seems to be some sort
of technical difficulty.</i>

51:13.370 --> 51:15.008
<i>Hey, hello, hi.</i>

51:16.973 --> 51:18.213
What the... What? What?

51:18.375 --> 51:20.912
- Lena Thurol?
- She has the suit of the powers!

51:21.078 --> 51:24.355
That suit. It's like Lex Luther's.

51:24.848 --> 51:27.488
<i>Luther? Thurol? Dude!</i>

51:27.651 --> 51:29.722
Same letters, wickeder order.

51:30.287 --> 51:32.289
<i>Does somebody need the IT girl's help?</i>

51:32.689 --> 51:35.329
<i>spawns}
- Oh, I can fix your little game.</i>

51:35.926 --> 51:38.668
<i>But I'd rather fix this whole city.</i>

51:47.070 --> 51:50.074
Oh, my cog! Platinum?

51:51.441 --> 51:53.250
It's okay. I'll protect you.

51:53.443 --> 51:57.357
Your first mission as student ambassador
is to make peace with this villain

51:57.514 --> 51:59.221
so the games can continue.

52:00.984 --> 52:03.260
Lena, I'm sure we can resolve this.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.555
What do you want?

52:04.788 --> 52:05.926
<i>What I want?</i>

52:06.323 --> 52:10.533
<i>What I want is to rid Metropolis
of supers.</i>

52:12.529 --> 52:13.872
Oh, goodness Croc.

52:14.030 --> 52:15.566
<i>Think about it, Metropolis.</i>

52:15.732 --> 52:18.008
That robot attack
was because of the supers,

52:18.168 --> 52:21.672
<i>Eclipse, Dark Opal, the Female Furies.</i>

52:22.038 --> 52:25.611
<i>Super villains target our city
because these supers are here.</i>

52:25.775 --> 52:28.255
Hey, that's not true. You're wrong.

52:28.578 --> 52:29.989
<i>Join my side.</i>

52:30.147 --> 52:32.593
<i>And</i> we'll free Metropolis of supers.

52:32.749 --> 52:36.026
- Never! This Super Hero saved me.
- Me, too!

52:36.186 --> 52:38.063
I'm with Super Hero High.

52:38.255 --> 52:39.325
Super Hero High!

52:39.990 --> 52:45.099
Super Hero High!
Super Hero High! Super Hero High!

52:45.996 --> 52:47.031
<i>AH right!</i>

52:47.430 --> 52:49.000
<i>Fine! Whatever!</i>

52:49.266 --> 52:52.736
- Kryptomites, attack!
- Attack!

53:03.446 --> 53:05.619
Flyers? Get the citizens to safety.

53:05.782 --> 53:07.693
The rest of you, get those Kryptomites!

53:07.918 --> 53:10.296
Supergirl. Bring in Lena.

53:10.554 --> 53:12.033
Yes, Principal Waller.

53:16.760 --> 53:18.296
Freezer burn.

53:30.807 --> 53:33.788
Be kind to the behind, bro.

53:33.977 --> 53:36.583
Good things I got a thick hide.

53:46.122 --> 53:48.329
All right!

53:48.491 --> 53:51.438
10 points to Big Barda
and the villain launch.

53:52.395 --> 53:53.396
Pathetic.

53:54.564 --> 53:59.172
Super Hero High couldn't even
secure itself long enough for the games.

54:06.810 --> 54:10.417
Come on, Lena, we don't have to fight.
Just turn yourself in.

54:10.580 --> 54:13.117
<i>That would be so easy, wouldn't it?</i>

54:13.316 --> 54:16.263
<i>Just another time
that Supergirl doesn't even have to try.</i>

54:17.153 --> 54:19.099
What?

54:20.724 --> 54:24.262
<i>All you had to do
was land on Earth to get super powers.</i>

54:24.427 --> 54:26.634
<i>I tried everything to get them.</i>

54:26.796 --> 54:29.106
<i>Chemical accidents,
close encounters with meteors.</i>

54:29.266 --> 54:30.973
<i>Genetic mutations!</i>

54:31.534 --> 54:32.535
Ah!

54:32.802 --> 54:36.045
<i>Day and night I have been
working on these Kryptomites.</i>

54:36.273 --> 54:39.652
<i>Even when it was so toxic
that my hair fell out.</i>

54:39.809 --> 54:41.311
I <i>didn't</i> stop.

54:49.419 --> 54:52.491
It appears that Lena Luthor
alias Lena Thurol,

54:52.689 --> 54:54.600
<i>sibling of known villain Lex Luthor,</i>

54:54.758 --> 54:57.568
<i>has launched a full scale
attack on the supers.</i>

55:05.468 --> 55:08.711
Attacking Super Hero High
will cost you an arm and a leg.

55:10.373 --> 55:12.683
Say hola to my mace! Ha!

55:20.250 --> 55:22.594
<i>Ni</i> hao, Kryptobot.

55:24.020 --> 55:25.863
Come on, let's go.

55:28.258 --> 55:30.499
Please, Sinestro. We need your help.

55:30.827 --> 55:33.569
Your team has such great super powers.
You could save so many.

55:33.763 --> 55:36.209
Out of the way. This is not our battle.

55:53.950 --> 55:54.951
Hiya!

55:57.153 --> 55:58.894
Blackfire! Come immediately.

55:59.222 --> 56:01.463
Or you will face the consequences.

56:07.530 --> 56:08.941
Blackfire!

56:14.738 --> 56:16.115
Come on, knifster.

56:19.142 --> 56:20.143
Huh?

56:20.377 --> 56:22.948
I thought you were leaving
to go to the planet of Korugar?

56:23.113 --> 56:25.889
I was. But you need my help.

56:28.051 --> 56:32.124
<i>Heroism, irrational but good.</i>

56:38.862 --> 56:41.536
Fire on three. One, two...

56:45.468 --> 56:47.379
Three.

56:48.471 --> 56:51.042
- What was that?
- We are the knifsters.

56:51.241 --> 56:54.279
We are the strongest
when we do the blast of togetherness.

56:56.379 --> 56:57.449
Diana!

56:58.782 --> 57:00.659
You're safe here. I'm going back to fight.

57:01.017 --> 57:04.089
No! You should stay here. Protect me.

57:04.254 --> 57:06.632
Uh... I mean, protect us.

57:06.990 --> 57:08.628
Should any of those things
escape the stadium.

57:08.892 --> 57:09.927
But they need me.

57:10.093 --> 57:13.165
I need you.
You already failed me once today.

57:13.496 --> 57:17.672
<i>If you want to go to the summit,
I command you stay.</i>

57:18.735 --> 57:22.649
- Respectfully, Ambassador, no way!
- Diana!

57:23.106 --> 57:24.107
Sorry, Mom.

57:24.274 --> 57:27.847
But the only future I want is one where
I do the most good wherever I am.

57:28.111 --> 57:30.387
And right now that means saving Metropolis

57:30.547 --> 57:32.083
and being there for my friends.

57:41.357 --> 57:44.668
- Hey! Where did Blackfire go?
- She's made her choice.

57:45.028 --> 57:48.805
If she lives, she will face
the consequences of her defiance.

58:09.953 --> 58:12.194
<i>Here! Take your best shot!</i>

58:12.355 --> 58:13.834
<i>Or you could...</i>

58:16.526 --> 58:18.767
Help. Help me, Supergirl!

58:19.829 --> 58:20.899
<i>L</i> 901 you!

58:24.667 --> 58:26.840
What?

58:28.638 --> 58:30.811
No. Stop!

58:37.514 --> 58:38.515
Mommy!

58:41.150 --> 58:43.289
n hurts.

58:44.020 --> 58:47.729
<i>You are just as irrational
as Platinum said you were.</i>

58:47.891 --> 58:49.529
<i>- Right, Platinum?
- Uh...</i>

58:51.561 --> 58:52.665
<i>Right, Master.</i>

58:53.129 --> 58:55.541
Oh, no. How do we stop them?

58:55.932 --> 58:58.208
Batgirl.
Can we magnetize the bots like before?

58:58.368 --> 59:00.541
No. They are not powered by computers.

59:00.737 --> 59:01.943
They're powered by...

59:02.372 --> 59:03.373
KWPfOmites!

59:03.540 --> 59:05.019
We need the anti-K juice!

59:10.547 --> 59:12.026
Frost, Ivy, come on!

59:27.664 --> 59:30.042
You guys get the anti-K sauce
from the science lab.

59:30.199 --> 59:31.200
I'll get rid of this guy.

59:31.434 --> 59:32.435
Meet you back here.

59:36.139 --> 59:38.244
- Over here, 8-bit.
- A-ha!

59:42.045 --> 59:43.388
Let's go for a ride.

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:29.534
<i>- You should have never come to Metropolis.
- My head.</i>

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:33.706
Hmm?

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:38.002
- Get away from my friend!
- Huh?

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:46.918
Aah!

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:14.642
Lena, please, you don't have to do this.

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:18.850
But <i>I</i> want to!

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.821
Lena!

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:40.464
You saved me.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.632
How dare you!

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:55.849
Cyborg, use your sonic blaster
to break the Kryptobots' canopies.

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:04.798
Now!

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:24.777
- So cool!
- Science for the win.

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:32.926
- You okay, Supes?
- I am now.

01:02:33.449 --> 01:02:35.554
Got you.

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:36.953
Nice catch.

01:02:45.692 --> 01:02:48.901
We'll be back to take you to Belle Reve
after we finish off the robots.

01:02:49.729 --> 01:02:51.606
You will be finished, supers!

01:02:59.706 --> 01:03:01.708
Ooh-ooh! Ooh-ooh!

01:03:02.008 --> 01:03:03.146
Ooh-ooh!

01:03:03.376 --> 01:03:04.878
Nice work, Blackfire.

01:03:05.045 --> 01:03:07.753
That was some pretty great
super-heroing, Batgirl.

01:03:11.785 --> 01:03:13.526
Hello? Can you hear me?

01:03:14.187 --> 01:03:15.996
<i>Oh, you're still alive.</i>

01:03:17.123 --> 01:03:18.124
<i>Pity it's come to this.</i>

01:03:18.325 --> 01:03:20.168
<i>Now I must reveal myself.</i>

01:03:20.327 --> 01:03:23.501
No, you don't. Just get me out of here,
and I'll finish the job.

01:03:24.097 --> 01:03:26.008
<i>The supers are right about one thing.</i>

01:03:26.633 --> 01:03:29.273
<i>There is no greatness without sacrifice.</i>

01:03:29.502 --> 01:03:32.642
<i>And for my greatness, I'm sacrificing you.</i>

01:03:37.177 --> 01:03:39.316
No! Let me out of here!

01:03:44.117 --> 01:03:45.391
<i>Hello, supers.</i>

01:03:45.919 --> 01:03:47.660
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.</i>

01:03:48.355 --> 01:03:50.562
I am Brainiac.

01:03:51.157 --> 01:03:54.661
<i>Lena Luthor failed.
But I will still destroy you.</i>

01:03:57.163 --> 01:04:01.043
<i>I</i> have gathered all the best technology
from across the galaxies

01:04:01.201 --> 01:04:04.512
<i>so that I can rid the universe
of Super Heroes.</i>

01:04:14.314 --> 01:04:17.488
<i>Oh! Not my metal.</i>

01:04:39.539 --> 01:04:41.576
Bow to my power.

01:05:04.531 --> 01:05:05.669
How do we defeat it?

01:05:06.399 --> 01:05:07.878
Everything has a weakness.

01:05:08.301 --> 01:05:10.178
We just have to figure out what his is.

01:05:10.770 --> 01:05:13.148
If Lena's been hanging out
with this Brainiac guy,

01:05:13.306 --> 01:05:15.286
she should know what gets his goat.

01:05:26.619 --> 01:05:27.962
What do you want?

01:05:28.288 --> 01:05:29.995
Brainiac is going to destroy the city.

01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:31.391
We need your help.

01:05:31.758 --> 01:05:34.500
Nope. No way. Not gonna happen.

01:05:34.828 --> 01:05:36.205
Lena, I know what it's like.

01:05:36.362 --> 01:05:39.434
When all you've known was being bad,
it's hard to be good.

01:05:39.732 --> 01:05:42.008
But if you help us,
you can still be a hero.

01:05:42.602 --> 01:05:43.603
Thanks.

01:05:44.337 --> 01:05:46.283
But no thanks, Big Barda.

01:05:46.539 --> 01:05:47.745
Now scram.

01:05:47.907 --> 01:05:49.318
Vamoose. Shoo.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.344
He's on the move. Oracle, bring my Batjet.

01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:19.812
- Full speed!
- Certainly, Batgirl.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.311
Okay, Oracle, enough stunts for one day.

01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:59.790
Let's blast this bot
back to the pit it was mined from.

01:07:04.551 --> 01:07:05.586
Huh?

01:07:09.455 --> 01:07:11.435
Fire defense blasters.

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.382
Huh?

01:07:35.848 --> 01:07:37.225
I don't see any obvious targets.

01:07:37.383 --> 01:07:39.989
But my X-ray vision
isn't working on that skull thing.

01:07:40.153 --> 01:07:41.291
<i>Must be lead-lined.</i>

01:07:41.454 --> 01:07:43.957
Bumblebee discovered I can't see through--

01:07:49.128 --> 01:07:50.368
Kryptonite?

01:07:50.863 --> 01:07:52.638
<i>Of course I have Kryptonite.</i>

01:07:52.799 --> 01:07:55.075
<i>Who do you think
taught Lena how to use it?</i>

01:07:55.535 --> 01:07:59.449
<i>She's a bright girl,
but needed a little guidance.</i>

01:08:10.483 --> 01:08:13.930
Hey, Robo, looks like
you could use some more ram!

01:08:19.559 --> 01:08:20.629
Or not.

01:08:26.064 --> 01:08:29.511
Bumblebee, Supergirl needs that
secret project you've been working on.

01:08:30.036 --> 01:08:32.607
- But it's not ready!
- You have to try.

01:08:35.108 --> 01:08:36.609
Drones, over here!

01:08:37.310 --> 01:08:38.515
Suit her up!

01:08:44.317 --> 01:08:46.160
Hmmm? What is this?

01:08:46.319 --> 01:08:50.131
Super suits are my specialty.
It'll keep you safe from Kryptonite.

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:51.390
It's laced with lead.

01:08:56.095 --> 01:08:59.201
Give me back my Mega-Rod! Whoa!

01:09:01.901 --> 01:09:05.404
<i>I will destroy you,
Princess of Themyscira.</i>

01:09:09.609 --> 01:09:11.850
Anyone figure out anything new
about Brainiac yet?

01:09:14.113 --> 01:09:17.026
Only that he really, really
wants to destroy us.

01:09:17.517 --> 01:09:18.723
Ha!

01:09:19.419 --> 01:09:21.399
You want me? Come get me.

01:09:42.908 --> 01:09:43.910
I found the ship's weak spot!

01:09:44.109 --> 01:09:45.111
Aim for the dots!

01:09:46.179 --> 01:09:47.385
Yeah.

01:10:00.827 --> 01:10:04.172
<i>I am stronger than your superpowers.</i>

01:10:17.376 --> 01:10:18.377
Whoa!

01:10:35.328 --> 01:10:36.864
<i>They need
to combine their power.</i>

01:10:37.296 --> 01:10:38.570
<i>They need a conduit!</i>

01:10:44.904 --> 01:10:47.009
Hey, supers, I've got an idea!

01:10:48.541 --> 01:10:51.181
<i>Platinum, I command you to get back here.</i>

01:10:51.344 --> 01:10:53.449
lam not just a machine anymore.

01:10:56.983 --> 01:10:58.690
Everyone, power me up.

01:11:00.887 --> 01:11:02.127
Worth a try.

01:11:09.095 --> 01:11:10.403
Now, charge!

01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:17.178
Just a little more!

01:11:46.499 --> 01:11:48.843
- Yeah, success!
- We did it!

01:11:52.872 --> 01:11:54.249
Platinum did it.

01:11:57.376 --> 01:11:58.377
Platinum.

01:11:58.845 --> 01:11:59.983
She saved us.

01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:01.581
Diana!

01:12:02.748 --> 01:12:03.749
Mom!

01:12:04.917 --> 01:12:06.521
Thank Hera, you are safe!

01:12:07.019 --> 01:12:08.999
I'm sorry I disappointed you
about the summit.

01:12:09.488 --> 01:12:10.489
Disappointed?

01:12:10.957 --> 01:12:12.937
Diana, I have never been prouder.

01:12:13.259 --> 01:12:16.866
But I thought you wanted me
to go to the summit to learn to be queen.

01:12:17.463 --> 01:12:21.673
There is nothing more regal
than standing up for what you believe.

01:12:22.235 --> 01:12:23.976
You will be an excellent queen.

01:12:26.539 --> 01:12:29.110
I am proud to share
the bond of eternity with you.

01:12:29.542 --> 01:12:30.646
Me, too.

01:12:30.877 --> 01:12:34.086
Too bad our bond is about
as long as I'm going to be in detention.

01:12:34.313 --> 01:12:37.453
You think your principal will let me
catch a Boom Tube back to Korugar?

01:12:37.617 --> 01:12:40.393
Of course! I shall get Principal Waller.

01:12:40.786 --> 01:12:42.959
Hey. I didn't say I had to go right now.

01:12:43.756 --> 01:12:45.394
Weren't you planning a day of funship?

01:12:45.825 --> 01:12:47.498
Mmm. yes!

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.071
First, we shall see how many of
the muffins made of bran we can eat.

01:12:51.364 --> 01:12:54.072
And then to gaze upon
the fishes made of jelly at the aquarium!

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:57.008
Oh, and then
to have the fight of the fluffy pillows!

01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:59.809
And after that,
the masks of the magic mud!

01:13:01.073 --> 01:13:02.575
Since Korugar Academy

01:13:02.742 --> 01:13:06.656
ran away before the last competition,
they have forfeited.

01:13:06.812 --> 01:13:10.225
And therefore, it is my pleasure to award

01:13:10.383 --> 01:13:13.159
the Intergalactic Game Championship to

01:13:13.386 --> 01:13:15.388
Super Hero High!

01:13:27.233 --> 01:13:31.238
- Oh, hi, everybody!
- Platinum, you're okay!

01:13:31.604 --> 01:13:33.880
Rebuilt and better than ever.

01:13:35.975 --> 01:13:37.386
Yes!

01:13:38.444 --> 01:13:40.515
Platinum, you're not finished yet!

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:42.581
But they're having a celebration.

01:13:42.815 --> 01:13:45.261
And I've never been
the type of girl to miss a celebration.

01:13:45.451 --> 01:13:48.125
Uh... That's because
you've never been any type of girl before.

01:13:48.287 --> 01:13:49.857
First time for everything.

01:13:50.589 --> 01:13:53.126
Super Hero High will hold
the Championship title...

01:13:53.359 --> 01:13:55.703
- Can I squeeze in with you?
- Sure thing.

01:13:57.496 --> 01:13:59.442
We always have room for another hero.

01:14:00.166 --> 01:14:02.669
<i>I invite you all to join us there.</i>

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:17.026
I will destroy those supers.

01:16:58.077 --> 01:16:59.078
