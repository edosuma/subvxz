WEBVTT

00:01.398 --> 00:04.564
[in unison]
I de...clare war!

00:04.631 --> 00:05.931
Ah, got you!

00:11.098 --> 00:12.964
How was
the Mardi Gras Parade?

00:13.031 --> 00:15.431
Ooh, honey,
it was fabulous!

00:15.498 --> 00:17.998
This six‐foot drag queen,
he showed me how to use

00:18.064 --> 00:19.631
my Chanel scarf as a weapon.

00:19.698 --> 00:20.698
‐ Wha!
‐ Ooh!

00:21.964 --> 00:23.131
Darryl, where's your mask?

00:23.198 --> 00:25.564
Oh, well, uh, the‐the
drag queen flicked it

00:25.631 --> 00:27.564
off my face
with his‐her scarf.

00:29.064 --> 00:30.798
Look, I got
an early morning tomorrow.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.531
‐ I gotta be goin'.
‐ Okay.

00:36.464 --> 00:38.464
Oh, just pretend
like we're not here.

00:41.264 --> 00:43.198
I've been trying
for two years.

00:46.564 --> 00:48.198
‐ See y'all later.
‐ Bye.

00:50.498 --> 00:53.531
Regine, I'm amazed. I never
thought I would see you go out

00:53.598 --> 00:55.564
with a guy that real
for that long.

00:55.631 --> 00:58.131
I never thought you'd go out
with a guy that..

00:58.198 --> 00:59.264
Don't!

01:00.531 --> 01:04.304
...warm.
I was going to say warm.

01:06.071 --> 01:07.538
Or was that wide?

01:07.604 --> 01:10.204

Man, the parade
was just great.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.304
Darryl let me ride on the top
of his APS truck

01:46.371 --> 01:48.304
doing my Miss America wave.

01:50.171 --> 01:52.404
That's almost as exciting
as when he gave you

01:52.471 --> 01:55.438
that roll of bubble wrap.

01:55.504 --> 02:00.071
Oh, you're just jealous
because Regine is out having fun

02:00.138 --> 02:02.578
and you're at home
shedding your skin.

02:02.644 --> 02:04.444
[laughing]

02:06.878 --> 02:09.144
Sounds like you and Darryl
are really gettin' along.

02:09.211 --> 02:12.344
Yeah, and who knows
where it could lead.

02:12.411 --> 02:14.644
Tomorrow, he's having me over
to meet his friends.

02:14.711 --> 02:16.811
Oh‐h, meetin' the crew.

02:16.877 --> 02:19.878
Mm‐hm. And I do not
have a thing to wear.

02:19.944 --> 02:21.678
And I wanna make
a good impression.

02:21.744 --> 02:24.811
Then stay home.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.611
Just saying don't start trippin'
over what you're gonna wear.

02:27.678 --> 02:29.811
Oh, that's easy for you to say.

02:29.878 --> 02:32.844
All your formal wear comes out
of the Jaclyn Smith Collection.

02:32.911 --> 02:33.944
Ah ha ha ha!

02:37.244 --> 02:38.944
Ahh ha ha ha!

02:40.211 --> 02:42.778
Hey, y'all remember
that pizza restaurant..

02:42.844 --> 02:45.111
...that was right
next to the rib joint

02:45.178 --> 02:47.944
that was right next
to the Cuban‐Chinese place?

02:49.978 --> 02:51.278
Yeah. Yeah.

02:51.344 --> 02:54.511
Well, they done
tore 'em all down.

02:54.578 --> 02:57.344
Made it a bowlin' alley
called Bowl Diddley's.

02:57.411 --> 03:00.111
Oh‐h, you know,
I say we go bowl.

03:00.178 --> 03:01.851
I'm really quite good.

03:01.918 --> 03:03.851
I've heard that lie before.

03:06.584 --> 03:09.118
What do you say
we make a little wager, huh?

03:09.184 --> 03:12.018
The loser has to compliment
the winner upon command

03:12.084 --> 03:13.484
for an entire week.

03:14.818 --> 03:17.684
Poor Kyle, that's the only way
he can get people

03:17.751 --> 03:19.818
to say nice things
about him.

03:19.884 --> 03:23.051
And yet, it shall fail.
You are <i>on!</i>

03:24.118 --> 03:26.251
What about you, honey?

03:26.318 --> 03:28.584
Yes, let's go bowling.
I love it.

03:28.651 --> 03:30.584
Reminds me of your head.

03:31.251 --> 03:32.318
[all laughing]

03:33.384 --> 03:35.384
What about you, Khadijah?
Ha ha.

03:36.918 --> 03:38.651
No, I'm gonna just stay at home.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.451
Come on, ever since
you and Scooter

03:40.518 --> 03:42.751
agreed to see other people,
you've been a hermit.

03:42.818 --> 03:44.818
‐ So what are you sayin'?
‐ You're a bore.

03:44.884 --> 03:47.384
You need to get out
and mingle. Have some fun.

03:47.451 --> 03:48.651
So lemme get this right.

03:48.718 --> 03:51.218
Instead of sittin' at home
in front of the TV

03:51.284 --> 03:54.251
I'll be standin' over a
hand blower at a bowlin' alley.

03:55.851 --> 03:56.984
How is that mingling?

03:57.951 --> 03:59.891
Other people
will see you doin' it.

04:04.124 --> 04:05.858
Thanks for comin'
up with me, Khadija.

04:05.924 --> 04:07.391
I'm kinda nervous.

04:07.458 --> 04:08.991
Yeah, you should be.

04:09.058 --> 04:11.458
Bringin' a man
a basket of hand towels..

04:11.524 --> 04:13.591
...what message are we
sending here, Regine?

04:14.958 --> 04:17.757
Bachelors don't buy hand towels.

04:17.824 --> 04:21.923
So if another woman comes over
and she sees them, she'll know.

04:23.758 --> 04:26.058
Well, a hickey
does the same thing.

04:27.991 --> 04:29.558
Plus, it's more fun.

04:30.624 --> 04:32.491
‐ Hey‐y, how y'all doin'?
‐ Hey.

04:32.558 --> 04:33.757
‐ Welcome, welcome. Hi.
‐ Thank you.

04:33.824 --> 04:36.324
Regine, this is
a new kind of cute for you.

04:36.391 --> 04:38.724
Yeah, well, you said
I was meetin' the posse.

04:38.791 --> 04:39.824
This is posse wear.

04:41.091 --> 04:42.358
And this is for you.

04:42.424 --> 04:44.924
Oh, right, cool.
Hand towels and loofah.

04:44.991 --> 04:48.658
Yes, and I was
fresh out, yeah.

04:48.724 --> 04:50.691
Khadija, why don't you
join me for dinner?

04:50.758 --> 04:53.491
I just wanted to see your
reaction to the hand towels.

04:53.558 --> 04:55.791
Atleast, come in
and meet my friends. Come on!

04:55.858 --> 04:57.458
You're gonna love them.

05:00.398 --> 05:01.631
Finally.

05:01.698 --> 05:04.331
Regine, this is Tanya and Joe.

05:04.398 --> 05:07.331
Tanya and Joe,
this is my Regine

05:07.398 --> 05:09.064
and her friend Khadija.

05:09.131 --> 05:11.431
And we're all gonna
get along just fine.

05:11.498 --> 05:13.398
Here, have a seat,
have a seat.

05:13.464 --> 05:15.431
Why do you have me
wearin' these pumps

05:15.498 --> 05:16.931
when she's got on jeans?

05:16.998 --> 05:18.698
Chill out.

05:18.764 --> 05:20.398
You, you look familiar.

05:20.464 --> 05:23.198
‐ Are you from East Orange?
‐ I was.

05:23.264 --> 05:25.331
Ha ha, I knew I recognized you.

05:25.398 --> 05:26.431
You're Nay‐Nay!

05:29.198 --> 05:31.931
You used to date June Bug,
with his big old forehead.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.298
[laughing]

05:33.364 --> 05:37.098
Yes, well, it's no‐no
to Nay‐Nay now.

05:37.898 --> 05:39.998
I've settled on Regine.

05:40.064 --> 05:42.531
Uh‐huh. So how's June Bug?

05:42.598 --> 05:43.698
[chuckling]

05:44.864 --> 05:46.264
Wouldn't know.

05:46.331 --> 05:49.431
We lost touch after he got
left back in the eighth grade

05:49.498 --> 05:51.764
the second time.

05:51.831 --> 05:54.831
So, Darryl tells me you write
poems. I'd love to hear one.

05:54.898 --> 05:56.131
Ah, okay.

05:56.198 --> 05:57.564
Ah, ahem.

05:58.864 --> 06:00.704
What do words mean?

06:02.471 --> 06:04.871
What do mean words mean?

06:04.938 --> 06:08.171
What do I mean
by these words?

06:08.238 --> 06:10.004
Don't listen
to the words.

06:10.071 --> 06:12.771
Listen to the spaces
between the words.

06:12.838 --> 06:16.638
The spaces, the spaces,
the spaces, the spaces..

06:19.204 --> 06:21.071
...like that one.

06:24.938 --> 06:25.971
Word.

06:27.538 --> 06:28.738
Bad poet.

06:28.804 --> 06:30.771
I'm also writing
a country western song.

06:32.371 --> 06:35.171
Khadija, maybe you could use
some of Joe's stuff in "Flavor."

06:35.238 --> 06:38.271
Well, what you do isn't as much
poetry as performance art

06:38.338 --> 06:40.838
which really wouldn't work
in a magazine.

06:42.604 --> 06:43.604
[in unison]
Oh.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.338
Hey, I could
turn it into a poem.

06:47.404 --> 06:48.738
Please don't.

06:49.938 --> 06:51.204
Look, I gotta go.

06:51.271 --> 06:53.404
(Regine)
Uh, no, Khadija, stay.

06:53.471 --> 06:54.471
Stay..

06:55.738 --> 06:58.238
Aw, you'll be fine.

06:58.304 --> 07:01.878
Just relax, and‐and be yourself,
Nay‐Nay. Oh, yes.

07:03.578 --> 07:06.311
Alright, y'all, I'm gonna
be out of here. Take it easy.

07:06.378 --> 07:08.344
‐ Alright.
‐ Take care of my Nay‐Nay now.

07:13.044 --> 07:16.278
So...what you think?

07:18.644 --> 07:22.178
I've never been in a room
where every chair is a recliner.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.811
That ain't all.
Check this out.

07:26.611 --> 07:27.978
Ta‐da.

07:31.544 --> 07:34.044
Alright, now, remember,
the loser has to compliment

07:34.111 --> 07:35.644
the winner
for an entire week.

07:35.711 --> 07:38.344
Are you sure
you can handle being a loser

07:38.411 --> 07:39.978
in bowling and in life?

07:40.044 --> 07:41.211
[Kyle chuckling]

07:49.244 --> 07:52.378
Obie, you knocked them all down.
You win! You win!

07:52.444 --> 07:56.178
I appreciate
your enthusiasm, sweet thing

07:56.244 --> 07:59.211
but I'm slightly embarrassed
by your ignorance of the game.

08:02.284 --> 08:03.384
Hey, okay,
good, Khadija.

08:03.451 --> 08:06.184
Hey, go get yourself
a pair of shoes, and let's go.

08:06.251 --> 08:07.851
You know, Max,
I've really realized

08:07.918 --> 08:11.418
I got a lot of work to do.
I'm gonna just go head home.

08:14.051 --> 08:15.984
Well, maybe
I could bowl one game.

08:16.051 --> 08:18.551
‐ Yes, one game.
‐ I'm gonna go get some shoes.

08:18.618 --> 08:21.884
Alright. Mama needs
a new pair of bowlin' shoes.

08:23.818 --> 08:26.651
Ha ha. Ye‐es!

08:26.718 --> 08:28.318
Hah! Woo!

08:28.384 --> 08:31.118
Girl, that was a gutter ball.

08:31.184 --> 08:33.150
Yes, but it rolled
halfway down the lane

08:33.217 --> 08:34.951
before it actually
went into the gutter.

08:35.018 --> 08:37.217
This might be
my lucky night, man!

08:38.717 --> 08:40.951
Let a skilled bowler
show you how it's done.

08:41.018 --> 08:42.951
No, you go first, Kyle.

08:47.884 --> 08:49.451
Concentrate, Kyle!

08:53.484 --> 08:54.851
[exhales]

09:00.491 --> 09:01.458
[bowling pins knocking]

09:01.524 --> 09:02.558
Uh.

09:03.191 --> 09:04.491
Five out of ten.

09:04.558 --> 09:06.858
Aren't those the odds
of a woman throwing up

09:06.924 --> 09:08.858
when she sees you naked?

09:24.658 --> 09:25.724
[bowling pins knocking]

09:25.791 --> 09:27.424
[clapping]

09:31.158 --> 09:32.924
Pressure's on now, though.

09:32.991 --> 09:35.391
I mean, how do I
follow up a strike?

09:42.691 --> 09:45.291
Yeah, that there's one way.

09:47.358 --> 09:50.458
So, they changed the name
of the movie to "Ready to Wear"

09:50.524 --> 09:52.924
because they didn't feel
Americans would understand

09:52.991 --> 09:54.291
<i>Pret a Porter.</i>

09:55.624 --> 09:56.891
We don't.

09:58.591 --> 10:00.931
Can you pass me some more
Smurfberry Kool‐Aid?

10:05.131 --> 10:08.231
So, Darryl tells me you're
a sales clerk at a boutique.

10:08.298 --> 10:10.731
Oh, no. Ha ha ha.
Let me explain.

10:10.798 --> 10:13.464
See, a sales clerk
is a low‐level employee

10:13.531 --> 10:17.098
who sells things
one at a time for commission.

10:17.164 --> 10:19.398
No, see, I buy clothes
for the whole store.

10:19.464 --> 10:21.764
‐ Oh.
‐ And what do you do?

10:21.831 --> 10:24.564
I'm a sales clerk at Loehmann's.

10:26.664 --> 10:28.598
Mmm! Aah! Ooh!

10:28.664 --> 10:31.831
Who knew something blue
could taste so good?

10:33.498 --> 10:36.398
You know, my man Darryl's
got big plans for his career.

10:36.464 --> 10:38.731
Really? You never
told me about your plans.

10:38.798 --> 10:42.831
Well, you see, if I stay
with APS for 15 more years..

10:44.431 --> 10:46.298
...my pension gonna kick in.

10:46.364 --> 10:50.364
Then I'll be cruisin' on easy
street in a brand‐new Winnebago.

10:50.431 --> 10:51.631
Deluxe!

10:51.698 --> 10:52.998
Yeah.

10:53.064 --> 10:56.931
Built for two...
me and my lady.

10:56.998 --> 10:59.031
Travellin' across this
beautiful land of ours

10:59.098 --> 11:01.238
fly fishing
from one stream to the next.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.538
Yeah, well,
I‐I have a similar dream

11:07.604 --> 11:10.138
except that it involves
letting someone else do

11:10.204 --> 11:13.471
the fly fishing for me
and putting it on a plate

11:13.538 --> 11:16.738
in front of me,
in a sauce, in France.

11:18.838 --> 11:21.071
I could've served tartar sauce
with the fish sticks

11:21.138 --> 11:23.071
if that's what you're saying.

11:25.771 --> 11:27.638
No. No, they were good.

11:27.704 --> 11:29.704
‐ Tanya, they were wer‐‐
‐ Mm‐hmm.

11:29.771 --> 11:30.938
Joe!

11:36.271 --> 11:37.604
Hoo.

11:38.838 --> 11:41.138
Uh...I'm gonna go on home.

11:41.204 --> 11:43.171
This blue stuff
is giving me a headache.

11:43.238 --> 11:46.138
Uh, I know what it is.
It's Tanya and Joe, right?

11:46.204 --> 11:48.438
They can be a little
rude sometimes. No, no.

11:48.504 --> 11:50.004
Hey, guys, listen.

11:50.071 --> 11:52.104
Regine is not feelin'
the friendship.

11:52.171 --> 11:54.871
‐ Really?
‐ Sit down. Come on, sit down.

11:57.571 --> 11:59.804
Now, look, there's
no reason the three of you

11:59.871 --> 12:02.111
can't love each other
the way I love y'all.

12:02.178 --> 12:04.411
Now we gonna sit here
and we're gonna love.

12:06.144 --> 12:07.144
Go.

12:14.978 --> 12:16.244
It was nice meeting y'all.

12:16.311 --> 12:19.344
‐ Yeah, come again, see ya.
‐ Yeah, we gotta do this again.

12:19.411 --> 12:21.378
Can I at least
get you a cab?

12:21.444 --> 12:23.944
‐ Yeah, sure.
‐ I'll grab my coat.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.944
Meet you in the hall.

12:35.782 --> 12:38.282
Overton, at this rate, you're
gonna bowl a perfect game.

12:38.349 --> 12:40.849
I know that. What'd you think,
I don't know that?

12:40.915 --> 12:42.182
I can read the scorecard.

12:42.249 --> 12:45.782
What'd you think, I can't
read the damn scorecard?

12:45.849 --> 12:47.249
You finished, bro?

12:47.315 --> 12:51.249
Oh, I'm sorry, man, pressure's
made me a little bit snippy.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.415
Curse this macho
athletic ability.

12:58.782 --> 13:00.449
[bowling pins knocking]

13:00.515 --> 13:04.322
Hey. Hell, I feel
a career change buzzin' at me.

13:05.722 --> 13:08.455
Okay, Max, let me know
when cutie pie's lookin' at me.

13:08.522 --> 13:09.522
Okay.

13:11.789 --> 13:13.722
(Max)
'Wait!'

13:13.789 --> 13:15.222
'Okay, now.'

13:15.289 --> 13:17.555
Alright, Khadijah!

13:17.622 --> 13:18.889
You're lookin' good, Khadijah!

13:18.955 --> 13:21.455
Why don't you just
give the man my phone number?

13:21.522 --> 13:24.022
You think I've been writing
your score on that board?

13:36.755 --> 13:37.722
[bowling pins knocking]

13:41.822 --> 13:44.322
Alright, Max,
what's my score?

13:44.822 --> 13:46.555
One.

13:46.622 --> 13:49.355
It's my best game ever.
I'm not even done yet.

13:54.322 --> 13:56.689
‐ Hey, Khadijah.
‐ What are you doing here?

13:56.755 --> 13:58.255
Girl, I need to talk.

14:01.829 --> 14:03.262
I believe this is yours.

14:03.329 --> 14:04.362
Sorry.

14:04.429 --> 14:06.362
Don't be,
you bowled me a spare.

14:07.695 --> 14:10.595
So I hear you're Khadijah.
I'm Roger.

14:10.662 --> 14:12.595
I've been watching you.

14:12.662 --> 14:15.695
‐ Good form.
‐ Good eye.

14:15.762 --> 14:17.095
Good God!

14:21.095 --> 14:23.729
Khadijah, now,
I need to talk to you.

14:23.795 --> 14:25.762
Well, I need some mack.

14:25.829 --> 14:28.895
And I think that's something
we both know I need more.

14:36.029 --> 14:37.862
[bowling pins knocking]

14:37.929 --> 14:41.162
They don't leap that high
in the Dance Theater of Harlem.

14:47.795 --> 14:49.729
[indistinct chatter]

14:49.795 --> 14:52.529
Okay, Synclaire, I guess I'm
just gonna tell you my problem‐‐

14:52.595 --> 14:55.695
Shh! Obie's about to bowl.
If he gets one more strike

14:55.762 --> 14:57.629
he'll have a perfect game.

14:57.695 --> 14:59.095
Did you just shush me?

14:59.162 --> 15:00.669
(all)
Shh!

15:04.402 --> 15:06.369
You know,
if‐if I make this shot..

15:07.669 --> 15:09.935
...I will have climbed
the highest mountain.

15:10.002 --> 15:12.569
I will have reached
the most unreachable star.

15:12.635 --> 15:14.869
And this place will give me
free cheese sticks

15:14.935 --> 15:16.869
for the rest of my life.

15:19.302 --> 15:20.435
Alright.

15:21.635 --> 15:25.369
I can't take it anymore!
Someone listen to me!

15:30.969 --> 15:32.769
Maybe it could wait.

15:37.435 --> 15:40.535
Obie, again, I am so sorry.

15:40.602 --> 15:41.969
Ah, that's alright.

15:42.035 --> 15:44.269
I'm sure there'll be
another time in my life

15:44.335 --> 15:46.769
when I bowl a perfect game.

15:46.835 --> 15:47.902
Yeah, that'll happen!

15:50.769 --> 15:52.269
You're still
perfect in my heart.

15:52.335 --> 15:54.835
Yeah, but can you give me
a free lifetime supply

15:54.902 --> 15:57.469
of cheese sticks?
I think not.

15:57.535 --> 16:00.275
Oh, come on, it's still
nice to see a woman tryin'

16:00.342 --> 16:02.109
to make her man feel better.

16:08.709 --> 16:11.975
Words of wisdom
from a handsome, handsome man.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.175
Thank you.

16:17.075 --> 16:20.609
You're welcome...good‐looking.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.042
[Kyle laughing]

16:23.575 --> 16:25.975
Well, now everybody's listenin'.
What the hell is it?

16:26.042 --> 16:29.009
My evening was
a total disaster.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.075
(Overton)
'Your evening?'

16:30.142 --> 16:32.375
I guess this is
the part of the show

16:32.442 --> 16:35.309
where we supposed to muster up
a little sympathy for Regine.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.575
Well, that ain't gonna happen.

16:41.675 --> 16:43.942
Yeah, feel better.

16:46.009 --> 16:49.509
Yeah, well, I guess I need
to get on up out of here, too.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.942
You know, go upstairs
and trim my nose hairs.

16:54.509 --> 16:56.442
And what lovely
nose hairs they are.

16:56.509 --> 16:57.709
Ha ha ha, yeah.

17:00.682 --> 17:01.849
Hoo‐hoo!

17:04.315 --> 17:07.115
And enough of them
to make a wig for Regine, yes.

17:08.949 --> 17:10.915
So, did you and Darryl
have a fight?

17:10.982 --> 17:15.082
Worse. I found out the man wants
to spend the rest of his life

17:15.148 --> 17:17.714
in a Winnebago gutting fish.

17:17.781 --> 17:20.382
Well, I ain't the one.

17:20.449 --> 17:22.182
I could've told you
from the beginning

17:22.249 --> 17:23.781
that it was not a match.

17:23.848 --> 17:25.348
Ah, shut up.

17:26.382 --> 17:28.749
You say that
about every man I date.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.582
'Cause it's true.

17:30.649 --> 17:33.649
Look, it's not gonna be easy
for you to find the one.

17:33.715 --> 17:36.382
You're a snob
from the projects.

17:36.449 --> 17:37.549
That's rare.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.182
I believe that one day

17:41.249 --> 17:45.015
you'll find your
Jean‐Claude Washington.

17:47.949 --> 17:49.149
[laughing]

17:49.215 --> 17:52.882
So, for real,
whatcha gonna do about Darryl?

17:52.949 --> 17:55.149
I don't know,
I‐I‐I can't string him along

17:55.215 --> 17:57.682
when it's obvious
we don't have a future together.

17:57.749 --> 18:00.389
Woop! Sounds like a break‐up.
Can I watch?

18:01.989 --> 18:04.589
I just want him to find
that fly‐fishing woman

18:04.655 --> 18:06.155
that he deserves.

18:06.222 --> 18:07.389
[telephone ringing]

18:07.455 --> 18:08.689
Maybe that's him now.

18:11.189 --> 18:12.789
Hello.

18:12.855 --> 18:15.922
Oh, come on, Kyle,
this isn't fair!

18:18.555 --> 18:21.589
You have a beautiful phone voice
and exquisite toes.

18:26.989 --> 18:28.255
[knock on door]

18:38.622 --> 18:40.855
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

18:41.722 --> 18:43.555
I'm glad
you could come over.

18:43.622 --> 18:44.889
Have a seat.

18:47.422 --> 18:50.555
It doesn't recline
but you can lean back.

18:50.622 --> 18:52.889
Oh, he he he.

18:59.289 --> 19:00.395
Regine‐‐

19:00.462 --> 19:02.995
Darryl, before you say
anything, let me.

19:04.562 --> 19:08.229
I don't think things
are gonna work out between us.

19:08.295 --> 19:10.695
‐ Regine‐‐
‐ No, no, let me explain.

19:10.762 --> 19:13.062
It's not that
you're not a nice guy.

19:13.129 --> 19:15.362
You're one of the nicest guys
I've ever met

19:15.429 --> 19:17.395
that's why
this is so hard for me.

19:17.462 --> 19:18.662
But Regine, it's okay.

19:18.729 --> 19:21.662
That is sweet of you
to be so strong.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.495
But you don't have
to pretend in front of me.

19:25.562 --> 19:28.495
Unleash your feminine side.

19:31.362 --> 19:32.862
Oh, no, I'm cool.

19:34.195 --> 19:37.195
You see, I was thinking
the same thing on the way here.

19:37.262 --> 19:39.895
I was just hoping
that we can still be friends.

19:41.429 --> 19:43.862
Oh, no, no.
No, you didn't, uh..

19:45.662 --> 19:48.829
See, no, you don't say,
"let's just be friends".

19:48.895 --> 19:50.962
‐ I say that.
‐ Okay, then say it.

19:51.029 --> 19:54.295
No, no. No, see, you can't
tell me when to say it

19:54.362 --> 19:55.795
I just say it.

19:57.195 --> 19:59.062
Right, okay. Let‐let's
talk about something else

19:59.129 --> 20:00.669
then whenever
you feel like it

20:00.735 --> 20:03.135
you can jump right in
with the friends thing.

20:05.135 --> 20:06.135
Fine.

20:06.769 --> 20:07.702
Mm‐hm.

20:11.102 --> 20:12.835
‐ Darryl?
‐ Mm‐hm?

20:14.035 --> 20:15.469
Let's just be friends.

20:15.535 --> 20:18.669
Oh, damn, man!

20:21.035 --> 20:22.969
Regine, this is so sudden.

20:26.235 --> 20:27.569
It happens.

20:34.302 --> 20:36.035
Well, I guess
I better get going.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.369
‐ Okay.
‐ I'll see ya.

20:38.735 --> 20:41.369
Well, hey,
it was fun hangin' out.

20:41.435 --> 20:43.735
Well, we're friends, right?
And friends hang out.

20:43.802 --> 20:45.369
‐ So I'll call you.
‐ Alright.

20:45.435 --> 20:47.369
‐ Okay, take care.
‐ You, too.

20:52.702 --> 20:56.169
‐ So? How did he take it?
‐ Oh, not well, mm.

20:59.635 --> 21:02.676
Well, you did
what you felt was right.

21:02.742 --> 21:04.476
You can't have
any regrets about that.

21:04.542 --> 21:05.976
No, I don't.

21:08.042 --> 21:09.976
Except, now, I'm alone again.

21:11.409 --> 21:14.142
But I have my friends.
I mean, I got you, right?

21:14.209 --> 21:16.115
That's right, girl,
you know I'm there for you.

21:16.182 --> 21:17.182
We're like sisters.

21:17.249 --> 21:18.415
[knock on door]

21:21.782 --> 21:23.449
Hi. Ready to go?

21:23.515 --> 21:24.782
Later, Regine.

21:32.582 --> 21:33.515
[screaming]

21:45.882 --> 21:47.549
[instrumental music]
