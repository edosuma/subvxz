WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.458
[technician] No allergies?
[Walt] Nope.

00:04.589 --> 00:08.923
No diabetes or kidney
or heart conditions?

00:09.135 --> 00:09.965
Nope.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.384
No chance you're pregnant?

00:12.305 --> 00:13.340
Let's hope not.

00:13.556 --> 00:15.717
Okay.
All right. Climb aboard.

00:18.102 --> 00:20.218
[motor whirring]

00:35.661 --> 00:38.038
[heart beating]

00:38.247 --> 00:39.748
[gunshots echoing]

00:43.169 --> 00:44.784
[dog barks]

00:52.803 --> 00:53.633
Thoﬂ

00:56.349 --> 00:57.885
[Omar]
Enjoy your shoot, Mr. Keslow?

00:58.100 --> 01:00.716
Well, I don't usually bother
with birds.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.018
Good boy, Thor.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.721
But a free trip's a free trip.

01:04.941 --> 01:06.522
[Sawyer]
Just think, Dan.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.816
You move Keslow
Pharmaceuticals to Absaroka,

01:09.028 --> 01:10.438
you could be here
for elk season.

01:10.655 --> 01:12.691
Mm, this fall,
I'll be in Zimbabwe.

01:12.907 --> 01:13.817
Come on, Thor!

01:14.700 --> 01:16.031
[sighs]

01:16.244 --> 01:18.200
Why'd you bring
that pompous ass?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.949
Hundreds of new jobs
in a shit economy, Omar.

01:21.165 --> 01:23.451
As mayor,
I got a lot weighing on me.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.290
[man]
God, I'm dying here.

01:29.507 --> 01:32.214
The guy at the store swore that
these boots would be the best.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.671
They totally gave me
blisters.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.548
How about those birds, Jenk?

01:36.764 --> 01:38.629
You don't have turkeys like that
in Omaha.

01:38.849 --> 01:41.682
I prefer my Wild Turkey
in liquid form.

01:41.894 --> 01:44.431
Listen, game's not the only
thing that makes Absaroka great.

01:45.106 --> 01:48.018
We got a new casino
that's catnip for tourists.

01:48.234 --> 01:49.849
And with Keslow
as a corporate anchor,

01:50.069 --> 01:52.560
we're guaranteed the green light
on Sandy's airport.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.611
Always the politician.

01:54.824 --> 01:57.315
Look, Sawyer,
you know I love Absaroka.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.742
Shit, I got a weekend place
not 10 miles from here.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.785
My problem's not
with your county.

02:01.998 --> 02:02.987
It's with your sheriff.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.324
Last man who tried to develop
here, he shot in cold blood.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.582
[Sawyer] Walt Longmire is not
anti-development.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.005
He's just anti-Barlow.

02:13.217 --> 02:14.627
I knew Barlow Connally.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.460
Your sheriff sounds like
my kind of guy.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.466
Don't worry.
Walt's on his way out.

02:19.682 --> 02:21.138
[Dan]
What do you mean, "out"?

02:21.350 --> 02:25.309
Our sheriff's dealing with
a minor legal issue.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.512
Wrongful death.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.855
I play golf with the lawyer
of the Connally estate.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.274
-He's gonna eat Walt for lunch.
-Walt's a good man.

02:33.112 --> 02:35.228
He's a little set in his ways,
but he works hard.

02:35.448 --> 02:36.904
[breathing heavily]

02:37.116 --> 02:38.572
Well, he's
still an obstacle.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.195
I'll tell you what.

02:40.453 --> 02:43.866
l'll consider moving my company
here if you get rid of Longmire.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.912
Well, that's easier said
than done, Dan.

02:46.125 --> 02:47.160
Of course it is.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.207
But real men don't take no
for an answer.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.647
Were all those tests necessary
to check a minor gunshot wound?

03:08.856 --> 03:10.892
And concussion. No.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.518
But given how hard it is
to get you in here,

03:12.735 --> 03:13.975
I figured I'd do them
while I could.

03:15.071 --> 03:16.402
Frankly, I was shocked
that you even kept

03:16.614 --> 03:17.820
your follow-up appointment.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.988
Well, I'm trying to be
more responsible, Doc.

03:20.493 --> 03:22.199
Whoever she is,
thank her for me.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.496
Um, good news.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.117
Scan shows a complete resolution
of your TBI.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.665
How's the, uh, memory?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.619
Better. I still can't remember
the attack, though.

03:33.089 --> 03:35.705
How many head injuries would you
say you've had over the years?

03:36.467 --> 03:37.752
Four or five.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.636
That I remember.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.052
And you played football --
high school, college.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.424
Do you ever get
any headaches?

03:43.599 --> 03:44.714
I'm getting one now.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.267
We know a lot more about the
long-term effects of concussions

03:48.479 --> 03:50.845
than we used to, but without
sampling your brain tissue --

03:51.065 --> 03:52.020
I'm still using that, Doc.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.313
Are you?

03:54.026 --> 03:55.527
l-l just think a smarter man

03:55.736 --> 03:57.567
probably would've retired
by now.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.566
How much longer do you plan on
doing this, Walt?

03:59.782 --> 04:00.988
Is there anything else?

04:01.200 --> 04:03.065
Uh, your cholesterol's
a little high.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.867
-Here's a statin.
-l'll eat more oatmeal.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.570
Of course you will.

04:23.514 --> 04:25.971
[police radio chatter]

04:30.521 --> 04:32.978
You said you wanted to be
more involved?

04:33.190 --> 04:34.600
Well, here you go.

04:34.817 --> 04:36.182
What happened?

04:36.402 --> 04:38.063
Jim Pine O.D.'d.

04:39.155 --> 04:40.941
[sighs]

04:43.033 --> 04:44.239
Does Mingan know?

04:44.452 --> 04:47.694
His son? Yeah.
Mingan found him.

04:48.414 --> 04:52.032
Jim Pine's the fifth O.D. since
the casino checks went out.

04:52.251 --> 04:55.789
Suddenly people have money,
they're, uh, celebrating.

04:56.756 --> 04:58.587
Courtesy of this guy.

05:00.259 --> 05:01.920
His name's Joey Takoda.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.252
I want Hector
to go after him.

05:09.602 --> 05:11.342
I am sorry.
I cannot do that.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.643
Joey Takoda is selling heroin
on the res.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.566
He's left Mingan Pine
a 14-year-old orphan.

05:19.779 --> 05:21.315
Hector is not
some Reservation Batman

05:21.530 --> 05:22.906
righting all of
society's wrongs.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.730
You know who the dealer is.
Go arrest him.

05:24.950 --> 05:27.817
l have.
Three times.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.740
But I can only hold someone
on a misdemeanor.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.571
Dealing's a federal crime.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.532
Now that white people are dying
from heroin,

05:34.752 --> 05:36.913
the feds have even
less time for us.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.748
The Hector we knew
never played God.

05:43.594 --> 05:46.006
He stepped in
only as a last resort.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.384
Besides, where is Jim Pine's
responsibility in all of this?

05:49.600 --> 05:51.807
You and I both know
that Jim was a junkie.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.975
-So he deserved it?
-No.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.473
But if we blame Jim's death
on this dealer,

05:55.689 --> 05:57.304
why not blame his last one?

05:57.525 --> 05:59.732
Or the guy who fired him from
Burger King when he was 22?

05:59.944 --> 06:02.026
Why not go after Nighthorse,
who sent the checks?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.853
So your idea is to do nothing

06:05.074 --> 06:07.360
and let our entire tribe
fall apart?

06:07.827 --> 06:08.691
Hmm?

06:09.578 --> 06:11.569
Right now,
my first priority is Mingan.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.589
[engine starts]

06:30.558 --> 06:31.798
[siren wails]

06:58.085 --> 06:59.791

07:13.851 --> 07:14.510

07:18.355 --> 07:19.936
-Hey, Punk.
-Whoa!

07:20.149 --> 07:22.265
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.395
[e Dad?
xhales deeply]

07:24.612 --> 07:27.729
You scared me.
[chuckles]

07:27.948 --> 07:29.108
What are you doing here?

07:31.368 --> 07:32.824
Office warming.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.451
Thank you.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.492
So, uh...

07:42.713 --> 07:43.873
You do all this
on your own?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.169
Yep.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.715
Now that you're here, you might
as well make yourself useful.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.254
Yes, ma'am.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.134
-This one?
-Yep.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.223
Okay.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.474
Thanks.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.185
[nail gun clicking]

08:07.029 --> 08:08.815
So, you'll be happy to know
I, uh,

08:09.031 --> 08:11.113
I went to see Doc Weston
for a physical.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.781
What'd he say?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.824
Well, uh...

08:15.037 --> 08:15.992
[nail gun clicks]

08:16.205 --> 08:17.570
Well, I got to eat
more oatmeal.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.746
[chuckles]

08:19.959 --> 08:21.199
So there's nothing
to worry about?

08:21.418 --> 08:25.627
No, no.
Uh...it's that thing.

08:26.382 --> 08:27.747
What thing?
[nail gun clicks]

08:28.467 --> 08:30.207
Well, my civil suit.
Um...

08:30.427 --> 08:32.509
They need a response
by Friday.

08:34.723 --> 08:37.886
Dad, you should've answered
that complaint weeks ago.

08:38.102 --> 08:40.218
It's okay.
I know you've been busy.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.768
I don't blame you.

08:43.065 --> 08:46.557
Blame me?
I'm not your lawyer.

08:46.777 --> 08:48.517
I assumed you would've
found someone.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.728
Well, people don't know
I'm being sued.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.563
I'd like to keep it
that way.

08:54.493 --> 08:57.075
Dad, l-l can't represent you.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.782
I'm your daughter.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.117
You represented Henry.

09:01.333 --> 09:05.167
Yeah, Henry's not a relative,
and he didn't have any options.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.459
You do.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.250
Options that don't reinforce
your guilt.

09:09.466 --> 09:10.501
I'm not guilty.

09:15.431 --> 09:16.546
Dad, me representing you

09:17.391 --> 09:19.632
confirms everything
they're accusing you of.

09:20.310 --> 09:24.895
Cronyism, corruption,
ignoring the rules.

09:26.442 --> 09:28.649
And you may not
have noticed, but...

09:29.862 --> 09:31.853
...l have a job.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.150
[nail gun clicks]

09:34.366 --> 09:35.867
So you're choosing Nighthorse
over me.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.156
[nail gun clicks]

09:49.465 --> 09:51.877
Here.
Uh, David Milgrom.

09:52.468 --> 09:53.753
He's a great civil attorney.

09:54.762 --> 09:55.877
Call him.

10:10.694 --> 10:11.854
Thanks for the plant.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.566
[nail gun clicks]

10:23.916 --> 10:25.326
I didn't fly Dan
all the way down here

10:25.542 --> 10:26.952
to have him go off
without me.

10:27.169 --> 10:28.909
You sure he didn't say
where he was going?

10:29.129 --> 10:33.793
Well, I told you, he and Pinkie
left before I got up.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.670
You're gonna thank me
for these airports

10:35.886 --> 10:37.342
when your hunting trips
are sold out.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.090
lwon't have anything
to hunt

10:39.306 --> 10:41.297
when your airport scares off
the game.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.178
You better hope Walt
doesn't catch wind

10:43.393 --> 10:44.724
that you're
selling him out.

10:45.854 --> 10:46.639
Hey.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.815
Isn't that Dan's dog?

10:49.024 --> 10:50.264
[dog whimpering]

10:50.484 --> 10:52.224
[Omar]
These dogs don't wander off.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.897
Hey, boy.
Hey, boy.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.691
Hey, hey.

10:56.907 --> 10:59.319
Hey, hey. Why are you out here
all by yours--

10:59.535 --> 11:01.947
[dog whimpers, barks]

11:07.501 --> 11:08.991
What the hell?

11:09.837 --> 11:12.874
If Omar says anything about
my divorce, I'm gonna sock him.

11:15.634 --> 11:16.464
Hey, Omar.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.504
Hey, Walt.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.761
Look, I didn't want to call you,
but, uh...

11:21.974 --> 11:24.386
two VIP guests of the mayor
are missing.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.057
Who are we looking for?

11:26.311 --> 11:30.475
CEO of an Omaha pharmaceutical
company, Dan Keslow.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.147
Mayor's been kissing his ass,

11:32.359 --> 11:34.270
trying to get him to move
his plant to Absaroka.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.522
I thought you said
there were two VIPs.

11:40.659 --> 11:43.571
Anyway, Dan's dogs came back,
but there's no sign of the guys,

11:43.787 --> 11:48.406
and the dog...
had this in his butt.

11:51.295 --> 11:54.833
You, uh...
You'll keep this quiet, right?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.380
That you lost two VIPs?

11:59.678 --> 12:02.670
I've sank every nickel I own
into this operation, Walt.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.255
It ain't fair.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.516
Lifetime of doing good work,
you make one mistake...

12:08.520 --> 12:10.385
But then I guess
I don't have to tell you.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.100
What do you mean?

12:14.193 --> 12:17.401
Well, you know, y--
y-your civil suit.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.859
Omar, take Vic,
start searching.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.407
l'll head to camp,
get Dan's dog.

12:24.620 --> 12:25.860
Maybe we can catch a scent.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.574
-l'm real good with dogs.
-So am I.

12:28.790 --> 12:29.950
You go with Omar.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.337
Looks like
it's just you and me.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.792
Keep it in your pants, Vicky.
I'm not in the mood.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.419

[hammer tapping]

12:59.446 --> 13:00.561
What do you think?

13:02.157 --> 13:03.658
It's almost an office.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.661
Land line.
How old school.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.778
Yeah, well,
the cell service sucks out here.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.164
So are you set up enough
to start offering legal advice?

13:16.380 --> 13:18.371
[hammer tapping]

13:21.385 --> 13:23.171
Oh. Yes.
Of course.

13:24.346 --> 13:25.552
Um...

13:25.764 --> 13:27.925
Have a seat.
[chuckles]

13:28.600 --> 13:31.091
And please don't tell me
that you killed someone.

13:33.355 --> 13:34.845
How do | go about
becoming a foster parent

13:35.065 --> 13:36.350
for a Cheyenne child?

13:36.566 --> 13:39.273
Well, I'd start
by not living over a bar.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.152
You're serious?

13:43.365 --> 13:44.571
lam.

13:45.701 --> 13:46.690
Okay.

13:48.036 --> 13:48.900
Um...

13:49.496 --> 13:51.987
The Indian Child Welfare Act
made it a big priority

13:52.207 --> 13:53.947
to keep Native kids
with Native families.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.159
So that'll work
in your favor.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.994
You know, once I get
my computers up,

13:59.172 --> 14:01.003
uh, I will start
the application process.

14:01.550 --> 14:04.087
We need to move quickly.
I have a particular boy in mind.

14:04.303 --> 14:05.463
l have Internet at home.

14:05.679 --> 14:06.919
I can print out the
materials tonight,

14:07.139 --> 14:08.174
and we can start tomorrow.

14:15.439 --> 14:16.929
Thank you.

14:17.149 --> 14:18.434
You're welcome.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.235
[zipper opens]

14:28.452 --> 14:31.114
Did either man carry
tranquilizer darts?

14:31.330 --> 14:32.740
[Jenk]
Not Dan.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.662
[urinating]
He shoots to kill.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.752
And the other guy?

14:37.961 --> 14:42.625
Oh, I doubt Pinkie's held a gun
in his life.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.581
[zipper closes]

14:47.888 --> 14:49.503
Maybe it's another
Dick Cheney situation

14:49.723 --> 14:51.338
where one of them shot
the other.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.550
If Pinkie's so inexperienced,
why did Dan invite him along?

14:56.646 --> 14:59.604
You know like they say,
if a bear shits in the woods

14:59.816 --> 15:02.478
and nobody saw you shoot it,
did it really die?

15:02.694 --> 15:06.186
Hey, we're wasting time.
We should be out there looking.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.647
Wait here, Sandy.
Radio if they come back.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.487
Let's go, Thor.
[dog barks]

15:13.497 --> 15:14.987
[Sandy]
I hope you find him, Longmire.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.365
Hate to find another developer
dead on your watch.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.964
This thing is tiny compared
to the bear dart that got me.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.090
Who hunts
with these things?

15:32.307 --> 15:33.672
Nobody hunts with those.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.549
Conservationists use them

15:35.769 --> 15:38.101
to catch and collar
medium-size game.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.392
Big cats, wolves, Pronghorn.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.399
So what's your take on these
missing guys?

15:44.569 --> 15:45.433
[chuckles]

15:46.029 --> 15:48.771
Just another entitled asshole
and his lackey.

15:49.032 --> 15:51.865
If my career weren't on the
line, I'd let them stay lost.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.829
[Sawyer]
Too much ground to cover.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.198
We need to get a helicopter.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.030
I told Omar
I'd keep things quiet.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.956
They've only been gone
a few hours.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.124
Sure hope you're not gonna
let your personal feelings

16:02.337 --> 16:04.293
interfere with your
duties here, Walt.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.371
I don't have feelings.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.541
Everybody knows
you're anti-development,

16:08.760 --> 16:09.875
but Absaroka needs jobs,

16:10.595 --> 16:13.007
and this pharmaceutical company
can provide those.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.637
[dog barking]

16:23.775 --> 16:25.731
What kind of hunter
leaves his game behind?

16:26.778 --> 16:28.769
Same kind that leaves his gun
behind.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.164
Pinkie!

16:45.338 --> 16:46.464
What's that
around his neck?

16:46.673 --> 16:47.628
Tracking collar.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.547
-He still alive?
-Yep.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.010
This thing's got to be
choking him.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.334
Won't come off.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.174
Where the hell is Dan?

16:55.390 --> 16:56.630
No idea.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.596
What's that?

17:02.606 --> 17:03.846
It's a news clipping.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.225
What's it say?

17:05.442 --> 17:08.650
"Serial Killer CEO:
Dan Keslow Must Die."

17:11.239 --> 17:12.740
Let's get him out of here.
Come on.

17:13.408 --> 17:14.648
[grunts]

17:22.792 --> 17:24.532
[breathing heavily]
Come on. Come on.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.414
Come on.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.330
[grunts]
Get it off.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.051
I can't--
[coughing]

17:32.260 --> 17:34.046
Okay. All right.
We're gonna get it off.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.718
We're gonna get it off.
Hold still.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.260
Okay. Move your
head out of the way.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.555
Hold him still.
{gags}

17:44.231 --> 17:45.391
All right.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.393
Okay?
[coughs]

17:49.611 --> 17:50.726
Okay.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.732
[gasps]

17:52.948 --> 17:55.655
Thank God.
[breathing heavily]

18:01.831 --> 18:03.492
Do you know who did this
to you?

18:04.417 --> 18:05.372
No.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.873
Dan's dog went after something
in the forest.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.249
Dan followed him.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.463
I heard a shot.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.800
A minute later, I felt something
sharp in my shoulder.

18:16.555 --> 18:18.466
You didn't see who taped you
to that tree?

18:20.642 --> 18:22.473
l was taped to a tree?

18:23.228 --> 18:24.468
Jesus.

18:25.188 --> 18:26.303
Did Dan see anybody?

18:26.940 --> 18:27.895
Wait.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.723
Where is Dan?

18:29.985 --> 18:31.350
Dan's missing.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.356
We found this nailed to the tree
above you.

18:34.698 --> 18:36.313
Why did I let him bully me
into this trip?

18:36.533 --> 18:39.024
I hate guns! I'm in marketing,
for Christ's sake.

18:39.202 --> 18:43.536
-Did you know about this?
-The mass execution
of endangered wolves?

18:44.249 --> 18:45.409
How could I not?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.911
We had protestors out in front
of the office for months.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.967
Hey. I got here as
fast as I could.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.510
That's perfect timing.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.679
I need you to take
this gentleman to the hospital,

19:01.891 --> 19:04.507
then drive by the weekend house
of his boss, Dan Keslow.

19:04.686 --> 19:07.302
He's missing.
Vic will give you the address.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.981
Okay.
Anything else?

19:09.232 --> 19:10.472
Contact Dan's wife.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.057
See if she's heard from him.

19:12.277 --> 19:15.314
And, uh, see if she's gotten
a call with a ransom demand.

19:15.530 --> 19:17.942
Dan may have been kidnapped
by anti-hunting activists.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.196
Wow.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.613
All right. Got it.
I think.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.948
Come on. Let's get you
to the hospital.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.077
You might have to fill in
some gaps for me while I drive.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.327
Let's call Game and Fish.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.079
Maybe they can help
us track this collar.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.062
Mingan?

20:01.910 --> 20:03.320
[sighs]

20:33.191 --> 20:34.601
[sighs]

20:39.322 --> 20:41.938
Mingan, I hope you do not mind
that I let myself in.

20:44.786 --> 20:45.821
What for?

20:48.123 --> 20:49.784
I wanted to check on you.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.991
And I brought you a gift.

20:56.214 --> 20:58.045
It is a medicine bag.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.590
It gave me strength
when I needed it most,

21:01.761 --> 21:03.467
and now I want you
to have it.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.050
You can just leave it
on my desk.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.928
No, I cannot.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.637
I need you to get out
of the bed, Mingan,

21:13.815 --> 21:16.227
and come here to me

21:16.443 --> 21:18.399
and take it
for yourself.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.899
The medicine
will give you strength,

21:22.365 --> 21:24.742
but you also need to find
your own.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.875
[sighs]

22:00.904 --> 22:04.146
I want you to know that as bad
as things seem right now...

22:05.742 --> 22:07.482
...you are going to be
okay.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.950
I think I may have found a way
to make sure of that.

22:14.334 --> 22:19.624
But first you need to get
dressed and eat something.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.088
And then I will take you
to school.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.023
Any word on Keslow, Ruby?

22:41.277 --> 22:43.484
[Ruby] Omar's still out looking.
And the mayor called.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.358
He's trying to get a helicopter
up to help with the search.

22:46.574 --> 22:48.781
Okay. Let us know
if he finds anything.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.870
[engine shuts off]

23:10.390 --> 23:11.630
[Walt]
Pyper Callans?

23:12.600 --> 23:15.467
We understand you're the expert
on wolves in Wyoming.

23:15.687 --> 23:17.097
I'm flattered.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.599
What's with the flags?

23:19.774 --> 23:21.605
Oh, they're called fladry.

23:21.818 --> 23:24.434
Contrary to popular belief,
wolves are naturally shy.

23:24.654 --> 23:26.519
Anything new scares them.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.195
I'm trying to educate
the ranchers

23:28.408 --> 23:30.649
into putting these flags up
and their guns away.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.700
Well, Pyper,
we're hoping you, uh,

23:32.912 --> 23:34.903
you may be able to help us
find a man

23:35.123 --> 23:37.079
who might have been kidnapped
this morning.

23:37.292 --> 23:38.407
Dan Keslow.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.163
Dan Keslow was kidnapped?

23:41.963 --> 23:43.999
Well, that's a nice piece
of news.

23:44.215 --> 23:45.295
You know Dan?

23:45.508 --> 23:47.464
Oh, all conservationists
know him.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.588
He's the asshole
who used a Judas wolf

23:49.762 --> 23:51.377
to destroy
the Lone Tree pack.

23:51.848 --> 23:52.837
A Judas wolf?

23:53.474 --> 23:57.012
A hunter puts a tracking collar
on a wolf and turns him loose.

23:57.228 --> 23:58.843
When the wolf returns
to his pack,

23:59.063 --> 24:01.554
the hunter follows
in a helicopter.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.641
Picks off the whole pack
from the air,

24:04.819 --> 24:06.730
sparing only the Judas wolf.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.402
So now, all alone

24:08.615 --> 24:11.573
and inadvertently having
destroyed his whole family,

24:12.035 --> 24:14.777
the Judas seeks another pack
to take him in.

24:15.038 --> 24:18.030
And the whole thing starts
all over again.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.204
Jesus.

24:22.337 --> 24:25.249
Is this the kind of collar
that Dan Keslow would've used?

24:25.423 --> 24:26.583
Where'd you get that?

24:26.925 --> 24:29.883
Found around the neck of another
hunter -- Dan's colleague.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.218
We found him tranquilized,
collared,

24:32.430 --> 24:33.840
and duct-taped to a tree.

24:34.057 --> 24:36.048
[chuckles]

24:36.267 --> 24:37.803
How poetic.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.556
Is this the kind of collar
that you use?

24:42.482 --> 24:44.564
Conservationists
in the field

24:44.776 --> 24:47.017
mostly use
the VHF pulse tracker.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.773
It lets us track
in real time.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.149
That is a GPS.

24:51.366 --> 24:52.697
Has a chip in it

24:52.909 --> 24:54.649
so it allows you
to download the data remotely.

24:55.578 --> 24:57.193
Thanks for your help.

24:57.413 --> 25:00.701
You think of anyone may have
used this collar, let us know.

25:00.917 --> 25:03.203
More likely I'll send them
a present.

25:04.504 --> 25:05.994
[chuckles]

25:11.803 --> 25:13.384
[Vic]
You saw those, right?

25:13.554 --> 25:16.296
[Walt] Every conservationist
in Wyoming uses those darts.

25:16.516 --> 25:17.722
It's not enough
to bring her in.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.978
But it may be worth tracking
our wolf lady's whereabouts

25:21.187 --> 25:22.097
these past few days.

25:22.313 --> 25:23.268
Right.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.116
What did you find
at Dan Keslow's?

25:41.332 --> 25:43.118
Place was dark and locked.

25:43.334 --> 25:44.574
Nothing was disturbed.

25:44.794 --> 25:47.080
There was a FedEx package
on the front porch.

25:47.296 --> 25:48.285
Arrived yesterday.

25:48.506 --> 25:49.791
Who's it from?

25:50.008 --> 25:53.421
Someone named Cara Fillmore.
Sent from Omaha.

25:55.805 --> 25:56.965
You reach Dan's wife?

25:57.181 --> 25:58.887
Valerie. Yeah.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.591
She hasn't heard from him since
he left, but that's normal.

26:01.811 --> 26:04.348
She said he rarely calls home
when he's hunting.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.813
Hey, Ruby.
[Ruby] Hey.

26:08.026 --> 26:09.391
Any ransom demands?

26:09.610 --> 26:10.474
No.

26:10.695 --> 26:11.901
What's all this?

26:12.113 --> 26:13.694
Omar broke down
the camp.

26:13.906 --> 26:17.774
Jenk's in your office waiting
for his son to pick him up.

26:17.994 --> 26:20.485
I hope you don't mind,
but I found something.

26:22.790 --> 26:26.032
After Dan shot those wolves,
somebody set up this Web page.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.710
Looks like a shaming site.
Who set it up?

26:29.922 --> 26:32.129
I don't know,
but the comments -- ugh --

26:32.341 --> 26:33.626
they're all pretty nasty.

26:33.843 --> 26:35.674
Can you print the names
of the commenters, Ruby?

26:35.887 --> 26:37.377
Already have.

26:37.555 --> 26:39.420
-Three copies.
-Thanks.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.966
Hey, uh, what do you want me
to do with this?

26:44.395 --> 26:45.475
Open it.

26:46.314 --> 26:47.269
Jenk.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.018
How's Pinkie doing?

26:49.567 --> 26:50.807
Oh, he's at the hospital.

26:51.027 --> 26:53.643
They're keeping him overnight
for observation, so...

26:54.155 --> 26:55.770
Any word on Dan?

26:56.282 --> 26:57.317
Well...

26:58.159 --> 26:59.774
Dan recently drew
a lot of heat

26:59.952 --> 27:03.035
for, uh, hunting a pack
of endangered wolves.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.704
Do you recognize
any of the names on that list?

27:06.375 --> 27:09.913
Somebody who, uh, may have gone
beyond idle threats?

27:10.129 --> 27:12.836
You know, I told him not to go
posting that photo,

27:13.049 --> 27:14.630
but he was so proud
of the kill.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.220
Wolves were delisted
for two years.

27:18.471 --> 27:19.836
It was legal at that time.

27:20.056 --> 27:22.047
Yep.
[Vic] Holy shit!

27:22.266 --> 27:24.643
Walt,
you need to see this.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.930
What the hell is that?

27:27.396 --> 27:28.727
That's a guinea pig.

27:29.941 --> 27:31.397
Does that mean something
to you?

27:32.110 --> 27:33.225
Maybe.

27:33.444 --> 27:36.527
Did, uh,
Cara Fillmore send it?

27:36.697 --> 27:38.073
She did.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.816
Well, then, yeah,
it means something to me.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.911
We're a drug company.

27:43.121 --> 27:45.112
We, uh, conduct clinical tests
on the drugs

27:45.373 --> 27:46.909
before they go to market.

27:47.125 --> 27:50.583
And drug-testing volunteers
call themselves guinea pigs.

27:50.795 --> 27:52.626
Cara Fillmore did
clinical trials

27:52.839 --> 27:54.249
for Keslow Pharmaceuticals?

27:54.465 --> 27:57.957
Yeah. She claimed, uh,
she had side effects --

27:58.177 --> 27:59.553
10 years later.

28:00.596 --> 28:03.178
When things go wrong
in people's lives,

28:03.349 --> 28:05.635
they need someone to blame,
so she sued us.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.433
Was the company at fault?

28:07.645 --> 28:10.011
Well, she signed a waiver.
She knew what she was doing.

28:10.231 --> 28:12.813
Thejudge
threw her case out.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.483
Since then, uh,
she just keeps hounding Dan.

28:16.696 --> 28:17.811
[door opens]
[man] Hello?

28:18.906 --> 28:21.067
Hi. I'm just here
picking up my dad.

28:21.576 --> 28:23.407
Oh, Sheriff Longmire,
this is my son, Jerrod.

28:23.578 --> 28:25.944
-Jerrod, Sheriff Longmire.
-How are you?

28:26.164 --> 28:28.576
Dad, we'd better get going.
It's a long ride back.

28:29.584 --> 28:31.575
Listen, could I borrow
your, uh, little boys' room?

28:31.752 --> 28:32.787
Right this way.

28:33.004 --> 28:34.995
Yeah, right here.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.420
Just on the left.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.456
Uh, you know...

28:39.969 --> 28:42.085
Dan can rub people the wrong
way,

28:42.930 --> 28:44.670
but he's not
a heartless monster.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.973
His father was
my best friend.

28:47.602 --> 28:48.967
Dan's like a son.

28:49.187 --> 28:52.304
So anything you need, Sheriff,
we'll get it for you.

28:52.523 --> 28:54.809
I know Dan would do the same
for me.

29:26.349 --> 29:27.054
No.

29:27.308 --> 29:30.550
No!No!No!No!

29:30.770 --> 29:33.386
Mathias!
Mathias, help me!

29:33.606 --> 29:34.721
Help me!

29:34.941 --> 29:37.557
[crying] No!

29:39.779 --> 29:42.486
[down-tempo music plays]

29:45.201 --> 29:48.159
Children look at their lives
and see no future.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.445
No one's stepping up.

29:51.374 --> 29:53.035
Nothing ever changing!

29:57.129 --> 29:58.665
How am I supposed to
protect them?!

29:58.923 --> 30:00.879
[screaming]
[gunshots]

30:11.310 --> 30:12.811
Cut him down.

30:24.699 --> 30:26.781
[men singing in Cheyenne]

30:43.634 --> 30:45.625
[singing continues]

31:14.206 --> 31:15.070
[Ferg]
Wow.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.913
150 posts congratulating
Dan Keslow's kidnappers

31:19.170 --> 31:21.331
and 39 who wish
they'd done it.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.001
How'd they even know
he was kidnapped?

31:25.217 --> 31:26.297
I don't know.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.262
So, what are you
working on?

31:32.725 --> 31:35.057
I'm running the GPS data
from the collar.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.225
Maybe it'll help us narrow down
the list of suspects

31:37.438 --> 31:39.474
by giving us a location.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.689
Are you wearing cologne?

31:43.402 --> 31:44.391
What?

31:45.863 --> 31:46.818
Hey, Ruby.

31:47.031 --> 31:48.020
[Ruby]
Good morning.

31:49.367 --> 31:50.573
Has the mayor called?

31:50.785 --> 31:51.615
No.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.078
But your lawyer's here.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.288
I didn't call a lawyer.

32:00.503 --> 32:02.243
My girlfriend fly-fishes.

32:02.463 --> 32:04.078
I moved all the way
from Brooklyn

32:04.298 --> 32:06.004
to stand in ice water
up to my hips.

32:06.217 --> 32:08.959
She's great, but she's gonna
give me pneumonia.

32:14.308 --> 32:15.263
Dave Milgrom.

32:16.602 --> 32:19.184
Mr. Milgrom,
there must be some mistake.

32:19.397 --> 32:20.432
I didn't call you.

32:20.648 --> 32:22.513
Your daughter asked me
to come.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.598
If the mountain won't go
to Muhammad,

32:24.819 --> 32:26.650
Muhammad must go
to the mountain.

32:27.613 --> 32:32.198
So, Mountain,
tell me about this civil suit.

32:34.078 --> 32:36.239
Well, there's not
much to tell.

32:37.206 --> 32:40.164
Barlow Connally estate
is claiming wrongful death.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.745
I'm innocent.

32:43.421 --> 32:46.333
Barlow was a big macher,
as we say in New York.

32:46.507 --> 32:48.372
Killing him might not
have been so smart.

32:48.592 --> 32:50.799
I would have
preferred not to.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.840
| see here
he was stabbed.

32:54.056 --> 32:55.296
I thought he was shot.

32:55.516 --> 32:56.631
He was.

32:58.144 --> 32:59.259
lshot him.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.056
He stabbed himself.

33:01.272 --> 33:03.103
But your fingerprints
are on the knife.

33:03.816 --> 33:04.805
Yeah.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.936
Okay.
[knock on door]

33:12.366 --> 33:14.607
So I've been running the
GPS data on that wolf collar.

33:14.827 --> 33:19.446
In the last 48 hours,
our wolf has covered 700 miles.

33:19.623 --> 33:22.831
He took the I-90 here
from Omaha,

33:23.627 --> 33:25.413
the home of
Keslow Pharmaceuticals.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.665
And Cara Fillmore,
our guinea pig.

33:28.299 --> 33:29.163
Yeah.

33:29.800 --> 33:30.710
Right.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.795
-So I-I guess we're done?
-Right now, I got to go to Omaha.

33:36.056 --> 33:37.341
That's 10 hours away.

33:37.558 --> 33:38.593
By car.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.443
Thanks for doing this,
Omar.

33:48.986 --> 33:51.693
Well, if we don't find Dan,
I'm ruined.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.438
I'm only one bad trip away
from losing everything.

33:54.658 --> 33:58.116
Well, if it helps, I've got
the name of a good lawyer.

33:58.329 --> 33:59.614
[grunts]

34:10.674 --> 34:12.539
[cellphone rings]

34:19.975 --> 34:22.011
Yes?
[Vic] It's me.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.560
I got those foster applications,
so if you want to stop by,

34:24.772 --> 34:26.308
I could walk you through
the process.

34:27.691 --> 34:29.272
That is no longer necessary.

34:29.485 --> 34:30.600
Sorry I bothered you.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.025
What happened?

34:34.990 --> 34:36.526
Mingan, uh...

34:42.122 --> 34:43.987
The issue resolved itself.

34:45.584 --> 34:46.869
Thank you, though.

34:47.086 --> 34:49.668
[dial tone]

34:52.007 --> 34:54.965
[Mathias] Joey Takoda
is selling heroin on the res.

34:56.971 --> 34:58.211
Jim Pine O.D.'d.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.840
Mingan found him.

35:02.309 --> 35:04.095
[engine starts]

35:06.605 --> 35:08.220
I want Hector
to go after him.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.860
[knock on door]

35:27.126 --> 35:29.037
I didn't kill
that guinea pig.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.126
It was my neighbor's,
and it died,

35:31.338 --> 35:33.545
and I asked
if I could have it.

35:33.757 --> 35:37.215
I don't sleep a lot.
Sometimes I make bad decisions.

35:37.428 --> 35:39.635
Well, I'm Sheriff Longmire,
Ms. Fillmore.

35:39.847 --> 35:41.132
Can we come in?

35:41.348 --> 35:44.385
[sighs] Okay.
But please be quiet.

35:44.602 --> 35:45.933
My son's napping.

35:49.231 --> 35:52.189
Dan Keslow is missing.
Do you know anything about that?

35:52.443 --> 35:55.901
I don't know where Dan Keslow
is, and I don't care.

35:56.405 --> 35:58.361
Well, it seems like
you cared enough

35:58.616 --> 36:00.652
to mail a dead animal
to his house in Absaroka.

36:00.868 --> 36:02.859
Well, he's got
a lot of houses.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.864
I rotate.
[kettle whistling]

36:05.080 --> 36:07.366
Omar, why don't you
wait in here?

36:07.625 --> 36:10.662
[whistling slows, stops]

36:12.671 --> 36:14.002
[clears throat]

36:16.008 --> 36:18.374
I understand you were part
of a clinical drug trial

36:18.594 --> 36:21.552
for Keslow Pharmaceuticals.

36:21.722 --> 36:24.304
l was working my
way through college,

36:24.558 --> 36:29.143
and Keslow was paying $500
to test a new drug.

36:29.355 --> 36:30.891
I thought it was safe.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.971
It was just a statin
for cholesterol.

36:33.192 --> 36:35.183
You know,
an old-people drug.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.195
But you had side effects?

36:37.738 --> 36:39.820
I didn't know anything was wrong
until two years ago

36:40.032 --> 36:41.863
when I was about 20 weeks
pregnant.

36:42.076 --> 36:44.442
My O.B. found too much protein
in my urine,

36:44.662 --> 36:47.074
and she told me I had
kidney disease.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.112
My doctor put me
on bed rest,

36:49.333 --> 36:53.451
but I developed preeclampsia
and went into labor at 21 weeks.

36:53.671 --> 36:57.664
And...Max was born
a micro premie

36:57.841 --> 36:59.752
with severe cerebral palsy.

37:01.053 --> 37:05.467
He'll never talk or walk,
and...

37:05.683 --> 37:07.969
I feed him through a hole
in his stomach.

37:09.103 --> 37:11.094
And you blame the drug
they tested on you?

37:12.022 --> 37:13.603
You're damn right I do.

37:13.816 --> 37:15.431
But Keslow,

37:15.609 --> 37:20.444
he claimed the preeclampsia
caused the kidney damage,

37:20.614 --> 37:22.070
not the other way around.

37:22.241 --> 37:26.200
And the judge ended up
throwing the whole case out.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.578
That's when you started
threatening Dan.

37:29.790 --> 37:34.033
Yeah. That coward
needs to take responsibility.

37:34.253 --> 37:37.871
I don't care about myself,
but my son...

37:39.717 --> 37:40.923
[sighs]

37:43.387 --> 37:47.426
My son is paying for what he
and his company did to me.

37:51.395 --> 37:52.726
I'm sorry.
Uh...

37:54.022 --> 37:56.980
This must be so hard
for you and your husband.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.355
Is he around?
May I speak with him?

38:01.321 --> 38:03.448
Jonathan's on vacation.

38:04.283 --> 38:05.693
Without you?

38:06.118 --> 38:09.702
Max needs full-time care.
One of us has to always be home.

38:10.664 --> 38:13.497
So we vacation in shifts.
[chuckles]

38:13.709 --> 38:14.994
Can you tell me
where he went?

38:16.462 --> 38:20.751
Uh, hunting with some friends,
I think, up north.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.373
Your husband's a hunter?

38:24.344 --> 38:25.754
Isn't everybody?

38:25.971 --> 38:27.336
Um...

38:28.974 --> 38:35.846
If your, um, husband checks in,
could you have him call me?

38:38.859 --> 38:43.068
Jonathan would never risk jail
doing something stupid.

38:43.614 --> 38:44.854
He loves me.

38:45.908 --> 38:47.864
He'd never leave me alone
with this.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.783
I don't care
what she says.

38:58.212 --> 39:00.123
Jonathan Fillmore
is your guy.

39:01.799 --> 39:04.006
I know this case
is important to you, Omar,

39:04.259 --> 39:06.671
but that doesn't give you
permission to steal.

39:08.055 --> 39:10.762
He's a hunter.
And I know hunters.

39:10.933 --> 39:12.969
And I'd shoot that
CEO asshole, too,

39:13.227 --> 39:14.967
if he'd done that
to my kid.

39:17.189 --> 39:18.725
Come on, man.
Let's go.

39:21.151 --> 39:24.234
Walt wants me to talk
to Pinkie again.

39:25.197 --> 39:29.281
Maybe he'll recognize this,
uh, Jonathan Fillmore.

39:29.493 --> 39:32.030
I don't know.
We'll see.

39:32.246 --> 39:33.281
Where are you?

39:34.498 --> 39:38.366
I found someone on the Dan Must
Die website worth talking to.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.205
I'll catch up with you later.

39:44.842 --> 39:47.675
Pyper, you got a minute?

39:47.928 --> 39:49.418
Deputy Moretti.

39:49.638 --> 39:52.675
You have come at a supremely
suspenseful moment.

39:53.851 --> 39:54.886
Come here.

40:02.568 --> 40:04.399
This is a female wolf
I'm tracking.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.647
She's a special favorite
of mine.

40:07.406 --> 40:10.398
She challenged the alpha female
in her pack and lost.

40:11.159 --> 40:12.865
She's been on her own
for about a year,

40:13.120 --> 40:15.862
but today, she's
approached another pack,

40:16.081 --> 40:17.446
hoping they'll take her in.

40:18.917 --> 40:19.667
[clears throat]

40:20.210 --> 40:21.416
So, uh...

40:23.338 --> 40:25.590
l was wondering
how all the trolls

40:25.799 --> 40:27.664
on the Dan Must Die
website...

40:29.469 --> 40:31.084
knew that he'd been
kidnapped.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.045
Good news travels.

40:33.265 --> 40:34.254
Mm.

40:35.392 --> 40:37.348
We didn't release
that information.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.726
I might have said
something.

40:40.731 --> 40:44.223
Said something or...
posted something?

40:45.485 --> 40:47.476
'Cause I just found out that you
set up that whole website

40:47.696 --> 40:49.482
right after the slaughter
of the Lone Tree pack,

40:49.656 --> 40:51.317
and you've been whipping
up hate ever since.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.236
Those sites are just words.

40:54.494 --> 40:56.234
People talk tough
when it's anonymous,

40:56.455 --> 40:59.993
but on their own, in reality,
they're just cowards.

41:00.208 --> 41:01.914
They don't follow through
on those threats.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.242
They don't.

41:04.379 --> 41:05.789
But you do.

41:06.465 --> 41:08.080
Ichecked.

41:08.759 --> 41:11.592
You were removed as the head
of the Utah conservancy chapter

41:11.803 --> 41:13.668
for violent
and criminal behavior.

41:13.889 --> 41:15.004
That was politics.

41:15.182 --> 41:16.592
I read the complaint.

41:17.601 --> 41:18.966
It said assault.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.518
The state legislature
took the gray wolf

41:21.730 --> 41:24.517
off the endangered list
as part of a backroom deal.

41:24.733 --> 41:27.065
Their decision was not
based on science

41:27.277 --> 41:30.610
or the wolves' best interest,
but purely on money.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.358
And that gives you the right
to break a chair

41:32.532 --> 41:33.692
over the congressman's head?

41:33.909 --> 41:35.649
I don't regret what I did.

41:37.454 --> 41:40.491
I took a plea.
I came back to the field.

41:40.749 --> 41:42.580
It's probably all
for the best.

41:45.879 --> 41:48.040
Since you're all alone
out here in the field now,

41:48.298 --> 41:51.040
I suppose that means no one
can verify that you were here

41:51.259 --> 41:53.341
the morning that Dan Keslow
was kidnapped.

41:53.512 --> 41:56.219
And no one can
verify I wasn't.

41:57.391 --> 42:02.010
If you had any evidence on me,
I would be under arrest.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.690
My girl's been run off
again.

42:11.071 --> 42:13.278
The world is cruel to females
on their own,

42:14.658 --> 42:16.489
no matter the species.

42:22.124 --> 42:24.080
-Hey, hey.
-Officer.

42:28.755 --> 42:30.086
How you feeling, Pinkie?

42:30.340 --> 42:32.376
My name is Ted.

42:32.551 --> 42:34.166
I hate that
stupid nickname.

42:34.428 --> 42:36.168
I'm sorry. Ted.

42:36.388 --> 42:37.628
Have you found Dan?

42:37.806 --> 42:40.297
No. But we got
a few leads.

42:40.559 --> 42:41.765
Angry animal activists,

42:41.935 --> 42:44.426
disgruntled drug-test
guinea pigs.

42:47.774 --> 42:50.811
Hey, you got...
any theories?

42:51.361 --> 42:53.317
Dan kidnapped himself.

42:55.449 --> 42:56.905
I don't follow.

42:57.117 --> 42:59.984
Dan set me up.
Think about it.

43:00.203 --> 43:03.240
He invited me,
someone who's never hunted,

43:03.457 --> 43:04.788
along on this trip,

43:05.000 --> 43:07.161
then takes me out
before everybody else is up

43:07.377 --> 43:10.119
so he can shoot me
with a tranquilizer gun

43:10.714 --> 43:13.046
and choke me
with one of his wolf collars,

43:13.300 --> 43:17.213
then duct-tape me to a tree,
just to humiliate me?

43:17.429 --> 43:20.421
He's probably at his house right
now just laughing his ass off.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.926
Why would Dan
want to humiliate you?

43:23.852 --> 43:26.264
To get back at me
for humiliating him.

43:27.606 --> 43:29.267
[Ferg]
We have a new suspect.

43:29.483 --> 43:31.348
-Who?
-Dan himself.

43:31.610 --> 43:33.646
Seems his wife, Valerie Keslow,
and Pinkie

43:33.862 --> 43:35.727
have been having an affair
for a year.

43:35.906 --> 43:38.022
-Dan found out?
-Pinkie thinks so.

43:38.283 --> 43:40.490
He thinks Dan staged
the whole thing to embarrass him

43:40.702 --> 43:42.567
and is sitting home right now
having a good laugh.

43:43.497 --> 43:45.783
-Omar!
-Yeah.

43:45.999 --> 43:48.206
Are the keys to Dan's house
still in his luggage?

43:48.418 --> 43:49.373
Yeah.

43:49.586 --> 43:50.496
Thanks.

43:51.505 --> 43:52.494
Okay, Ferg.

43:52.964 --> 43:55.671
Let's go pay another visit
to Dan Keslow's house.

44:08.146 --> 44:09.386
[vehicle approaching]

44:24.579 --> 44:27.241
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I can get that.

44:28.375 --> 44:29.410
But it'll cost extra.

44:44.558 --> 44:45.764
YOLO, asshole.

45:21.136 --> 45:24.173
Dan?
Are you in here?

45:54.628 --> 45:55.583
Dan?

45:56.838 --> 45:58.578
Wake up, Dan.
Come on.

46:00.926 --> 46:03.292
-Wake up, Dan. Wake up.
-Wake up.

46:04.346 --> 46:05.586
[groans]

46:05.764 --> 46:07.129
-Wake up, Dan.
-Oh!

46:07.390 --> 46:08.891
Dan.
[groaning]

46:09.559 --> 46:12.767
-Come on, come on. Come on.
-Aah!

46:13.647 --> 46:14.682
What is this?!

46:15.565 --> 46:17.351
What is this?!
Get this off of me!

46:17.567 --> 46:18.522
Calm down, Mr. Keslow.

46:19.903 --> 46:22.019
-Aah!
-l've been stabbed!

46:22.280 --> 46:23.941
Holy shit! I've been stabbed!
[screaming]

46:24.199 --> 46:25.860
-Calm down, Mr. Keslow!
-l've been stabbed.

46:28.662 --> 46:30.118
[echoing]
Ferg, call an ambulance.

46:35.877 --> 46:37.742
Hell, now that you saved
Keslow's life,

46:37.963 --> 46:39.624
maybe he won't hate you
so much.

46:39.839 --> 46:41.750
Might even consider
moving his company here.

46:43.510 --> 46:46.092
Why would he hate me?
He doesn't even know me.

46:47.555 --> 46:48.305
[Dr. Weston]
Sheriff?

46:55.772 --> 46:58.388
What's with the audience?
Are you trying to get me fired?

46:58.608 --> 47:01.270
I'm not supposed to be running
expensive MRIs without approval.

47:01.486 --> 47:02.692
Was I right?

47:02.862 --> 47:04.238
Those weren't
stab wounds, were they?

47:04.406 --> 47:05.646
No. No,
they weren't.

47:05.907 --> 47:08.023
But I didn't find a feather
inside him this time.

47:08.243 --> 47:10.950
Unfortunately,
I didn't find a kidney, either.

47:11.162 --> 47:12.743
Dan's missing a kidney?

47:12.956 --> 47:14.241
The wounds are incisions

47:14.457 --> 47:16.072
from a Iaparoscopic surgery
done by a professional.

47:16.293 --> 47:19.035
You're telling me Dan Keslow's
kidney was surgically removed?

47:19.212 --> 47:20.827
Yeah, and believe
it or not,

47:21.089 --> 47:22.875
an organ's harvested somewhere
in the world every minute.

47:23.091 --> 47:24.956
But it's usually the poor
giving away their organs.

47:25.176 --> 47:27.132
Guys like Dan are usually
on the receiving end.

47:27.304 --> 47:29.215
-Can I see him?
-No. He's sedated.

47:29.431 --> 47:30.716
Just come back in
the morning, okay?

47:30.974 --> 47:32.305
And try not to broadcast

47:32.517 --> 47:34.223
that I'm doing
these secret favors for you.

47:34.436 --> 47:37.269
The last thing I need is to get
mixed up in your civil suit.

47:59.878 --> 48:01.539
Hurting Joey Takoda
is useless.

48:02.505 --> 48:04.757
How can you say that
after what happened to Mingan?

48:05.258 --> 48:06.919
I mean, it is not enough.

48:08.845 --> 48:10.130
We need to think bigger.

48:10.347 --> 48:11.883
I have an idea,
but I need your help.

48:12.098 --> 48:15.090
The whole reason I need Hector
is because I can't help.

48:15.310 --> 48:17.266
I uphold the law.
lcan't break it.

48:17.479 --> 48:18.389
Oh.

48:19.147 --> 48:20.933
But you can send me into danger
with no backup.

48:21.107 --> 48:22.392
You signed up
for this, Henry,

48:22.650 --> 48:24.811
with the first letter
you took from that wall.

48:25.028 --> 48:28.771
I can feed you information,
but that's all I can do.

48:28.990 --> 48:30.605
Hector's on his own.

48:34.245 --> 48:37.737
Out of curiosity,
what was it you needed?

48:37.957 --> 48:41.199
If there is nothing you can do,
the less you know, the better.

48:47.675 --> 48:49.290
It's wabbit season.

48:49.511 --> 48:50.876
[laughs]

48:51.096 --> 48:53.508
[knock on door]
Oh, boy. Wabbit tracks!

48:53.723 --> 48:54.929
Thought you'd like
a visitor.

48:55.141 --> 48:57.632
Hey!
Oh, good boy!

48:57.852 --> 49:00.844
Good boy! Yeah.
Come on.

49:01.064 --> 49:03.271
Don't usually allow animals
here, but...

49:03.483 --> 49:05.269
Well, the nurses
seem to like me, so...

49:05.485 --> 49:06.395
[chucang]
Hey.

49:06.611 --> 49:07.817
How you feeling
this morning?

49:07.987 --> 49:09.773
Like I want to get back
to work.

49:09.989 --> 49:11.820
But the doctor
won't let me go.

49:12.033 --> 49:14.615
Mr. Keslow, they just took
your kidney out of you.

49:18.748 --> 49:22.036
Doc Weston said you have no
recollection of the operation.

49:23.711 --> 49:25.212
I remember shooting
a turkey.

49:25.422 --> 49:27.413
Then something hit me
in the back of the leg.

49:27.632 --> 49:29.714
Next thing I know,
I'm waking up in my own bed.

49:29.926 --> 49:32.167
You received some death threats
from activists

49:32.387 --> 49:33.843
because of your
wolf hunting.

49:34.055 --> 49:35.966
Those people are babies.

49:36.182 --> 49:38.639
They shout because they're
too scared to shoot.

49:38.852 --> 49:41.264
Anyway,
they should be grateful.

49:41.479 --> 49:42.889
After I took out that pack,

49:43.106 --> 49:46.098
Wyoming put gray wolves
back on the endangered list.

49:46.901 --> 49:48.607
Does this man seem
familiar?

49:49.571 --> 49:50.731
Should he?

49:51.072 --> 49:54.314
That's Jonathan Fillmore,
the husband of Cara Fillmore.

49:55.160 --> 49:57.196
Oh, the whiner.
Listen.

49:57.412 --> 49:59.619
She was an adult when she
signed up for that drug trial.

49:59.831 --> 50:01.446
No one held a gun
to her head.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.998
She's just one more person
looking for a check.

50:05.962 --> 50:07.168
You don't seem
too concerned

50:07.380 --> 50:09.336
about finding out
who stole your kidney.

50:09.549 --> 50:10.664
It's done.

50:10.884 --> 50:12.340
It's not like
I'm gonna get it back.

50:12.552 --> 50:14.258
At least I've got Thor.

50:14.429 --> 50:15.293
Right?

50:15.513 --> 50:17.674
You'd never betray me,
would you, buddy?

50:18.391 --> 50:20.131
Is your wife
getting here soon?

50:20.560 --> 50:22.221
I told her not to bother.

50:23.104 --> 50:25.060
Oh, good boy.

50:25.315 --> 50:26.350
Sit.

50:26.983 --> 50:28.393
That's a good boy.

50:28.651 --> 50:30.642
The wolf collar
was a ruse.

50:30.862 --> 50:33.649
The kidnapperjust used
the GPS collar

50:33.865 --> 50:37.028
and the newspaper clipping
to throw us off,

50:37.243 --> 50:38.949
buying time
for the surgery.

50:39.913 --> 50:42.279
Cara Fillmore suffered
permanent kidney damage

50:42.499 --> 50:44.160
from the drug she tested.

50:44.375 --> 50:47.867
Maybe her husband kidnapped Dan
to get a replacement for her.

50:48.087 --> 50:49.418
What's Dan think?

50:49.631 --> 50:51.963
Well, he seems surprisingly
uninterested.

50:52.175 --> 50:53.585
[knock on door]
Yep.

50:53.801 --> 50:56.634
Walter, Ted Sarton's here.

50:58.890 --> 50:59.800
Pinkie.

51:00.058 --> 51:01.969
Right.
Show him in.

51:02.769 --> 51:04.009
Right this way, sir.

51:11.194 --> 51:12.775
You wanted to see me,
Sheriff?

51:12.987 --> 51:14.693
Yeah.
Take a seat.

51:17.909 --> 51:20.446
I wanted to thank you
for sending us to Dan's house.

51:20.662 --> 51:23.324
He was there,
just where you guessed he'd be.

51:23.998 --> 51:25.738
He was?
How was he?

51:26.376 --> 51:27.991
How do you think he was?

51:28.920 --> 51:30.330
Angry?

51:30.547 --> 51:32.833
Well, surprisingly not.

51:33.633 --> 51:37.217
Um...do you mind if! make
a phone call?

51:37.428 --> 51:38.508
To Dan's wife?

51:40.014 --> 51:41.879
I told them
about the affair.

51:47.647 --> 51:48.557
Yes.

51:49.816 --> 51:50.976
I'm gonna call his wife.

51:51.234 --> 51:54.852
After what he did to me,
I have to warn Valerie.

51:55.071 --> 51:56.936
Well, I got to say,

51:57.156 --> 51:59.442
he didn't seem very interested
in her, either,

51:59.659 --> 52:00.819
when I brought her up.

52:01.035 --> 52:03.242
That's because
he's faking it.

52:04.163 --> 52:06.028
He came after me.

52:06.249 --> 52:08.035
He's gonna go after her.

52:09.210 --> 52:10.666
Take a seat.

52:15.425 --> 52:16.756
I don't think he did this.

52:17.594 --> 52:19.004
Why not?

52:19.679 --> 52:20.634
Thon

52:21.598 --> 52:23.554
I think Dan would shoot you.

52:24.225 --> 52:26.341
I'm not sure he'd shoot
his dog.

52:27.061 --> 52:29.643
I think it more likely
that, uh,

52:29.814 --> 52:32.055
you and Valerie staged
the whole thing.

52:32.275 --> 52:35.233
That collar around your neck,
that was traced to Omaha,

52:35.445 --> 52:36.525
where you both live.

52:36.738 --> 52:38.854
And you and Valerie
certainly knew

52:39.073 --> 52:41.029
about the hunting
controversy.

52:43.119 --> 52:44.484
One thing I don't get.

52:45.455 --> 52:47.411
Why not kill Dan?

52:48.082 --> 52:49.618
Why just take his kidney?

52:50.168 --> 52:51.157
What?

52:51.753 --> 52:53.914
Someone took Dan's kidney?

52:54.088 --> 52:55.248
That's crazy.

52:56.883 --> 52:57.838
And ironic.

52:58.635 --> 52:59.875
What's ironic about it?

53:00.136 --> 53:03.003
A year ago,
Dan sent a company-wide e-mail

53:03.181 --> 53:05.217
asking everybody to get
a blood test.

53:06.476 --> 53:07.340
He was looking for a match

53:07.602 --> 53:09.433
for someone who needed
a kidney transplant.

53:10.647 --> 53:12.638
Do you know who the blood drive
was for?

53:12.857 --> 53:15.064
The e-mail said someone
in the Keslow family.

53:15.276 --> 53:16.482
That's what he called us.

53:17.111 --> 53:20.444
Knowing Dan,
I figured it was for him.

53:21.616 --> 53:24.483
Well, Dan's kidney is gone,
not replaced.

53:24.744 --> 53:26.985
Valerie and I didn't do this.

53:27.205 --> 53:28.911
We're totally healthy.

53:29.707 --> 53:31.413
And if it wasn't Dan,

53:32.377 --> 53:34.993
then who the hell duct-taped me
to a tree?

53:43.221 --> 53:46.588
Uh, get the names
and contact information

53:46.849 --> 53:49.056
of all of Dan's employees
in Omaha.

53:49.268 --> 53:50.804
And his close relatives.

53:51.020 --> 53:52.601
Maybe "family" really meant
family.

53:52.814 --> 53:54.020
Okay.

53:57.777 --> 53:59.392
[sighs]

54:04.200 --> 54:06.236
[urinating]

54:13.292 --> 54:14.668
Ruby!

54:14.919 --> 54:16.375
Call Omar!

54:33.020 --> 54:34.556
[knock on door]

54:36.023 --> 54:37.638
Jerrod,
is your father in?

54:37.859 --> 54:39.724
Uh, he's upstairs resting
right now.

54:39.902 --> 54:41.733
-Can you come back later?
-Nope.

54:45.533 --> 54:47.649
[Jenk breathing heavily]

55:00.006 --> 55:03.749
Sheriff. What brings
you to Omaha?

55:04.010 --> 55:06.001
Dan Keslow's kidney.

55:06.220 --> 55:08.211
That's what you have
inside your body, right?

55:09.849 --> 55:12.591
What, you want to cut it out
and check?

55:12.810 --> 55:14.471
Well, I'm hoping
it doesn't come to that.

55:14.687 --> 55:16.643
Sheriff, I think you should go.
My dad needs to rest.

55:16.856 --> 55:19.268
You were in quite a hurry
to get your father home.

55:19.442 --> 55:21.057
Was that because
you had a surgeon

55:21.319 --> 55:22.809
and an unwilling
kidney donor waiting?

55:23.070 --> 55:24.731
There's no way for you to prove
that, so I would --

55:24.947 --> 55:26.653
Enough.Enough,Jenod.
Enough.

55:28.451 --> 55:30.692
I'd give you the
kidney back if I could.

55:30.953 --> 55:32.238
Scout's honor.

55:33.790 --> 55:35.451
I honestly didn't know
where it came from

55:35.666 --> 55:37.281
until about an hour ago.

55:37.502 --> 55:39.834
Jenk, a guy with your money
and your means,

55:40.004 --> 55:41.915
there are legal ways
to do this.

55:42.131 --> 55:47.046
Yeah. Well, I was rejected by
all the transplant registries.

55:47.261 --> 55:51.595
Who wants to waste a prime organ
on an old boozehound like me?

55:52.266 --> 55:53.847
And I'd accepted it.

55:55.061 --> 55:57.143
I guess my son hadn't.

55:58.606 --> 56:00.096
I lost my mother
when l was young.

56:00.274 --> 56:01.810
I wasn't about to
lose my dad, too.

56:02.860 --> 56:08.696
You know, Jerrod says that
Pinkie and Dan never saw him.

56:08.950 --> 56:11.032
Nobody but Dan even knew Dad
was sick.

56:11.244 --> 56:12.950
How'd you figure that out?

56:13.162 --> 56:16.120
I noticed your dad
had to, uh...

56:16.332 --> 56:17.617
take care of business
pretty often.

56:17.834 --> 56:20.120
That's a classic sign
of kidney disease.

56:20.962 --> 56:23.874
So you're the Keslow family
member that needed a kidney.

56:24.715 --> 56:26.546
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

56:26.759 --> 56:28.750
But after the blood drive,

56:29.345 --> 56:32.178
Dan told me
that there were no matches.

56:32.431 --> 56:34.092
[Jerrod]
But there was one.

56:34.308 --> 56:36.799
I found out that Dan Keslow was
a match, that lying coward.

56:36.978 --> 56:37.933
He...

56:38.563 --> 56:41.521
He had a chance to save
my dad's life, and he refused.

56:41.732 --> 56:43.893
So you convinced him
with a tranquilizer gun

56:44.110 --> 56:45.350
and illegal surgery?

56:45.528 --> 56:47.564
We were just playing
by Dan's rules.

56:48.239 --> 56:51.572
He always says, "Real men
don't take no for an answer."

56:53.035 --> 56:54.366
All right.
So what -- So what now?

56:54.537 --> 56:56.152
-You gonna take me to jail?
-No.

56:56.414 --> 56:58.325
I'm afraid
that's not up to you.

56:59.125 --> 57:01.116
But it is up to Dan Keslow.

57:03.963 --> 57:05.703
He says we're good.

57:14.390 --> 57:15.846
This is a release form.

57:16.642 --> 57:17.893
When did Dan send that?

57:18.102 --> 57:20.593
Faxed it over
about an hour ago.

57:20.813 --> 57:23.054
Donating his kidney
after the fact

57:23.274 --> 57:25.185
and indemnifying Jerrod and me.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.396
You know, men will
go to great lengths

57:28.613 --> 57:30.569
to prove that
they're not cowards.

57:31.741 --> 57:33.857
Especially if they really are.

57:48.925 --> 57:50.586
This is quite a spread.

57:51.510 --> 57:52.169
Yep.

57:53.429 --> 57:55.294
Is this where he, uh...

57:56.349 --> 57:57.088
Yep.

58:00.227 --> 58:02.718
So what brings you out here,
Mr. Milgrom?

58:04.065 --> 58:05.555
I brought you your file.

58:06.484 --> 58:09.442
And my, uh, legal opinion.

58:10.738 --> 58:12.103
You should settle
this case.

58:12.949 --> 58:14.689
Settle?
Why?

58:15.993 --> 58:18.075
Mm, $1,500, for a start.

58:20.247 --> 58:21.987
That's all I'd owe Barlow?

58:22.208 --> 58:24.199
No, that's what you'd owe me
and my billable hours

58:24.377 --> 58:25.617
if I was on
the clock today.

58:26.212 --> 58:27.418
Lawsuits are expensive,

58:27.630 --> 58:29.586
and Barlow's estate has
deep pockets.

58:29.799 --> 58:32.165
Even if you win,
it's gonna cost you,

58:32.385 --> 58:34.797
so I say settle.

58:35.012 --> 58:37.503
Get back to enjoying
this view.

58:41.227 --> 58:42.512
How about this?

58:43.104 --> 58:46.346
I hire you.
I don't settle.

58:46.857 --> 58:49.644
It's time Barlow took no
for an answer.

58:51.153 --> 58:52.108
Okay, then.

58:52.738 --> 58:54.148
More money for me.

59:00.246 --> 59:00.996
[car alarm chirps]

59:07.878 --> 59:10.711
Yo, tell Ozzie 15 minutes.
I'm on my way.

59:23.561 --> 59:25.677
[fire crackling]

59:28.024 --> 59:29.013
[gun clicks]

59:35.239 --> 59:37.104
[grunts]

59:49.712 --> 59:51.373
[Henry]
Looking for this?

59:51.630 --> 59:53.916
Please don't, man!
That's my whole stash!

59:54.133 --> 59:55.839
You're a traitor
to your people!

59:56.052 --> 59:59.215
You don't just push heroin.
You push death and despair.

59:59.972 --> 1:00:01.178
[grunts]

1:00:01.932 --> 1:00:03.513
Please.
Please don't.

1:00:03.726 --> 1:00:05.512
That's not mine.

1:00:05.728 --> 1:00:07.969
Beat the shit out of me!
Take my teeth!

1:00:08.189 --> 1:00:10.521
But if you torch that,
they will kill me!

1:00:10.733 --> 1:00:12.223
Then burn in hell!

1:00:12.443 --> 1:00:14.525
No!No!No!

1:00:14.737 --> 1:00:15.692
No!

1:00:27.458 --> 1:00:29.790
[men singing in Cheyenne]

1:00:38.803 --> 1:00:41.010
[wolf howling]
