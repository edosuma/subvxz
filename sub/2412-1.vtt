So many things that I wanna say

00:21.880 --> 00:25.180
You know I like my
girls a little bit older

00:25.280 --> 00:29.420
I just wanna use your love tonight

00:29.520 --> 00:31.220
Ooh!

00:31.320 --> 00:32.460
Unh, unh.

00:32.560 --> 00:37.363
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

00:37.520 --> 00:39.365
Unh.

00:39.960 --> 00:44.020
I ain't got many friends
left to talk to

00:44.120 --> 00:47.205
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble

00:47.800 --> 00:51.300
You know I'd do anything for you

Oh, man. Not another one.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.643
I shouldn't have been looking
for my ChapStick, buddy.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.571
You're just stunned, I think.

01:40.280 --> 01:43.020
Yeah. I mean, you got the
wind knocked out of you.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.300
I did that on a jungle gym.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.644
Had the wind knocked out of me too.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.060
I'll give you a couple seconds.
You'll be fine.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.561
Yeah.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.700
Come on.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.060
Maybe you just need a little...

01:58.160 --> 02:00.801
You want mouth-to-mouth, man?

02:01.040 --> 02:02.820
Maybe that'll help.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.580
I just... I don't want
you to bite my mouth.

Tammy, get over here.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.020
You're late again.
Do you own a watch much?

03:10.120 --> 03:12.460
I know I'm late. A deer
jumped out of nowhere.

You look like crud. Oh, my God.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.849

Excuse me, Keith.
We need some more ketchup.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.420
Okay. English, though, Javier.
This is America.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.366
- It was English.
- That wasn't English.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.500
- Is that blood?
- TAMMY: Yeah.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.380
A deer hit my car on the way in.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.740
- You should maybe see a doctor.
- No kidding.

KEITH: Okay, thanks, Javier.
That's great advice. See you later.

03:56.240 --> 04:00.020
Tammy, I'm terminating your
employment at Topperjack's.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.540
You've gotta be shitting me.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.460
No, I'm terminating your employment.
I need your badge.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.540
What ba...? You mean my name tag?

04:06.640 --> 04:09.700
- Yes, exactly. I need your badge back.
- TAMMY: It's not a badge.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.540
It's a name tag, and you made
me buy it with my own money.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.780
That's company policy.
I need it back.

04:14.880 --> 04:19.079
Well, I need you to stop sweating through
your shirts and grossing everybody out.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.660
It is hot. And when
it's hot, people sweat.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.980
- Not like that. Not like that.
- KEITH: It's how it is.

04:25.080 --> 04:26.820
- That shit's medical.
- KEITH: Listen!

04:26.920 --> 04:30.500
Tammy, you have already been fired.
I have already terminated your employment.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.340
You are at least 40 seconds fired...

04:32.440 --> 04:35.340
so please exit the Topperjack's.

Fine. You know what?
I'm gonna give you this.

- No.

Read between the lines.

do it, so it's not as good.

- I get it, Tammy.
- Poom. You get that?

04:50.720 --> 04:53.420
- KEITH: What is that?
- A little version of this.

hit you on the way out.

that the meat here is real shitty.

- Real, real, real shitty.

- That's the truth.
- That's not true.

what it is, but it's not bird.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.780
It's 110 percent chicken.

Bird doesn't come
out of squeezy tubes.

it's mostly dick and beak.

Wow, you're home so early.

- I'm sorry you got fired.
- TAMMY: Shut up, Missi.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.260
Why are you in my house
making my husband dinner?

08:03.360 --> 08:06.420
Uh, actually, I made her dinner.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.620
You're gonna get your ass kicked.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.820
You hungry? You wanna
eat my fist for din...?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.660
Ow! Shit.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.100
I am so sorry, Tammy.
You startled me.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.660
Keep your dirty fingers
out of my mouth.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.620
You scratched my tongue.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.260
I'm leaving you, Greg.

08:21.360 --> 08:24.604
I'm taking the household money
and getting out of here.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.100
God! Nice, Greg!

08:27.200 --> 08:29.260
You have to cheat with the neighbor?

08:29.360 --> 08:32.260
You can forget about me
feeding your stupid cats, Missi.

08:32.360 --> 08:36.539
- I'm divorcing you, and I'm suing you, bitch.
- For what?

08:36.640 --> 08:40.249
For being an asshole.
That's what I'm suing you for.

08:42.679 --> 08:45.100
Why is there only $63 in here, Greg?

08:45.200 --> 08:47.489
Whatever. I'm keeping all of it.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.780
Just don't touch anything.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.521
And don't let her touch my underwear.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.640
You know, you never made
me dinner. Not even once.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.888
And it smells really good too.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.580
Yeah, I'll see you in court!

09:33.680 --> 09:36.780
I hope you both choke
on your shitty dinner!

10:08.160 --> 10:10.340
Greg's cheating on me, Mom.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.740
- What?
- Yeah, I know.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.620
What a jerk, right?

10:14.720 --> 10:16.460
What happened?

10:16.560 --> 10:22.060
I went home after a shitty day,
and Greg and Missi Jenkins...

10:22.160 --> 10:25.660
are having, like, a really romantic
dinner at our dining room table.

10:25.760 --> 10:26.980
And Greg made it.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.380
Okay, then I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.300
I'm not exactly thrilled about it myself.
I just need to borrow your car.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.860
Why? Where's yours?

10:35.960 --> 10:39.740
Mine is smoking on Highway 13 because
a deer jumped out in front of me.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.940
Can I just have your car so I
can get out of this shitty town?

10:43.040 --> 10:45.540
I will drive you to work.
I'm not giving you my car.

10:45.640 --> 10:48.740
I don't need you to drive me
to work, okay? Keith fired me.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.180
Little prick.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.260
- Are we really gonna do this again, Tammy?
- What?

10:53.360 --> 10:56.500
DEB: Every time something bad
happens, you throw a fit...

10:56.600 --> 10:59.620
say you're leaving, you never get
more than 10 miles outside of town...

10:59.720 --> 11:03.580
you start feeling sorry for yourself,
and you come back and throw another fit.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.700
- That's not true.
- It's a pattern.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.060
It's not a pattern.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.260
- It is.
- That's not even what a pattern is.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.180
A pattern is a thing that
comes in pairs of two.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.660
You just don't know science.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.140
A pattern is a series
of things or events...

11:16.240 --> 11:19.700
that repeat themselves on
and on, sometimes into infinity.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.900
That's what a galaxy is.
It's not a pattern.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.380
- Fine.
- God.

11:23.480 --> 11:26.540
If you don't wanna help me,
just give me the keys to Dad's truck.

11:26.640 --> 11:30.580
- No. Absolutely not.
- Fine. Then I'm gonna take Grandma's car.

11:30.680 --> 11:34.180
- No, you're not. She is old and not well.
- Then she doesn't need a car.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.820
Right? You answer that.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.220
- Don't go. Tammy.
- Grandma, I need your car keys.

11:38.320 --> 11:42.725
Yep, I heard everything,
and I am ready to go.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.820
I'm taking your car.
I'm not taking you.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.340
- You're not getting my car unless you take me.
- TAMMY: No.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.980
- Oh, yeah. What?
- DEB: Mom.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.060
- What, you packed a bag?
- PEARL: Yeah.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.780
Wait a minute. No one
is going anywhere.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.180
I am. I'm just not taking
this asshole with me.

11:56.280 --> 12:00.380
Hey. You're not exactly my first choice
for a traveling companion either...

12:00.480 --> 12:03.620
but you're the best bet I have
to get out of this stupid house.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.540
I'm sorry, Deborah, but it is
a stupid house. And I hate it.

12:06.640 --> 12:09.860
I love you, but I am not gonna
die in this house alone.

12:09.960 --> 12:13.807
You're not gonna die here alone.
You're gonna die here with me and Don.

12:14.560 --> 12:17.900
- That's a shitty thing to say.
- That's a very shitty thing to say.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.100
I meant it in a good way.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.300

terrible if I were gay?

I don't care if you're gay...

left of it. So you just watch your mouth.

blame me for everything, like always?

41:12.280 --> 41:15.380
I do. I blame you for shoving me
out of a hotel room last night...

outside like a dog.

me come home from school when I was 10...

41:26.800 --> 41:29.660
and finding an empty room,
that's what I blame you for.

41:29.760 --> 41:33.460

a little kid? You left me all alone.

and I don't need your money.

- What?

- Don't you leave me here.

Look, I was not in my right mind for
many years because of the drinking...

48:11.760 --> 48:14.500
and when I realized that I'd
stepped over the line...

48:14.600 --> 48:19.500
where I was actually thinking of sleeping
with my own daughter's husband...

48:19.600 --> 48:24.608
well, then I just didn't know
what could happen and...

48:25.200 --> 48:27.329
That's why I left.

We're charging her with
possession of oxycodone.

49:00.240 --> 49:03.100
Well, she's got prescriptions
for everything. She's old.

49:03.200 --> 49:06.620
She had 32 oxycodone pills,
and they were not prescribed to her.

49:06.720 --> 49:09.043
Judge set her bail at $3000.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.740
She didn't really mean it.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.460
And here's the money back.
No hard feelings.

- PEARL: I said "Keep the car running."

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.940
- TAMMY: You need to be more articulate.
- PEARL: I have a bag on my head.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.660
And by the way, why does mine have no
expression and yours has a smiley face?

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.980
TAMMY: It's not smiling.
I'm showing tiger teeth.

a mustache and a smile.

perpetrated your crime with?

- LENORE: Okay.

- Jesus.
- And we'll pull that trailer off.

- Merlin's.

- Because I dig wizards, man.

- Get out of town.

this again. I'm fascinated.

- Please don't wear that shirt to the party.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:39.971
Can we call a truce, or do we
have to actually fistfight?

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.567
Grandma, I brought you some coffee.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.380
Hey.

01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.689
Hello?

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.620
Grandma, I brought you some coffee.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.884
Grandma?

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.980
Grandma?

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.323
Grandma? Grandma.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.820
Grandma. Grandma.

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:10.140
Come on. Shit. Come on, wake up.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.260
Grandma, wake up!

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.843
Wake up! God.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.407
I'm so sorry.

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.443
I'm so sorry.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.365
Shit.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:33.804
Hey!

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.940
- She's not breathing. She's dead.
- LENORE: What?

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.540
- Oh, my God, what?
- TAMMY: She's dead.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.020
Oh, Robin, call 911.

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.020
- TAMMY: She's dead. She's not breathing at all.
- You can't be serious.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.220
What's happened?

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.980
She's not breathing, and I
just let her drink all night.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:50.860
- LENORE: No, no, honey. It's not your fault.
- TAMMY: It is my fault.

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:53.620
Tammy, it's not your fault.
Oh, my God. What happened?

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:55.380
(SCREAMING)

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:57.450
Pearl! Oh, my God!

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.860
Oh, God! Oh, my God, Pearl!

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.964
Pearl!

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.380
What the fuck?!

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:08.460
- What the fuck?
- What happened?

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.420
LENORE: Go get her.

01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.660
- Oh, my God.
- SUSANNE: She's not dead.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.060
- TAMMY: on, my God.
- PEARL: What?

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:17.540
- TAMMY: Sit. Okay, okay.
- I think she passed out.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:19.660
- TAMMY: What were you thinking?
- What?

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:22.700
You weren't breathing.
We all thought you were dead.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:26.300
You are gonna clean your shit up.
You're gonna stop all this drinking.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.380
Do you hear me? You look terrible.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:31.180
Well, my feet...
I don't feel so good.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.860
Goddamn it, Pearly.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.761
Nobody should die in a lawn chair.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.580
TAMMY: All right. All right,
don't shake her, don't shake her.

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.100
Don't bounce her so much.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.100
Remember, she's not taking all of her
pills she's supposed to be taking.

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.409
EMT: Okay. Thank you, ma'am.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:51.540
Did I flash my boobs last night?

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.540
- TAMMY: Yeah. You did.
- Did I?

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.020
Yeah. You were throwing
them around last night.

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.260
Beep, boop. All the way. Yeah,
Earl has them all over Facebook.

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:02.260
TAMMY: They look good. I mean...

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.060
Oh, my God.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.540
Oh, my God, I was mean...

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.804
Oh, I was mean to you.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:11.740
I called you Cheeseburger.
Oh, my God.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:14.860
- It's okay.
- SUSANNE: Pearly, we'll be right behind, okay?

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.820
- TAMMY: It's okay. It's okay.
- PEARL: Oh, no.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.402
- SUSANNE: We'll follow, okay?
- TAMMY: Yeah.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.121
Oh, shit.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:26.820
Hey, officers.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:30.220
Ambulance got here first,
but she's gonna be okay.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.100
So don't worry about it.
Thank you, though.

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.700
Ma'am, we got reports that someone was
burning a Jet Ski on the lake last night.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.620
- You see anything?
- Oh.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:43.820
Uh, it's super uncool.
I would never burn a watercraft.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.340
- Oh, no.
- No.

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.620
No?

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.380
We've also been tracking
a 2004 Cadillac de Ville...

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.884
towing a Jet Ski that was involved
in a robbery. Anything on that?

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.220
Uh...

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:57.180
You know, uh... Ooh, wow.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:01.890
That's a Hawaiian bear shirt.
You don't see a lot of those around here.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.620
You probably see quite a few.

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.540
You're gonna have to
come with us. Let's go.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.420
- TAMMY: Oh. Come on, man.
- Let's go, ma'am.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.820
Stand back, ladies. Right this way.

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.500
TAMMY: I'm going with...

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.980
- I bet you see a lot of bear shirts.
- OFFICER: No, no, ma'am.

01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:18.420
- Constant.
- OFFICER: Ma'am. Get...

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.340
- Are you serious?
- TAMMY: Ow. There was a bee.

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.780
- There's no bees here, ma'am.
- There was a bee.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.884
You can't run from the law.

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:31.740
GUARD 1: Tammy Banks.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:33.890
GUARD 2: On the gate.

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.740
See you later.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:43.163
I hope not.

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.220
Hey, Dad.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.220
Tammy. You rehabilitated?

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:55.441
- I guess.
- Then let's go home.

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.300
Wherever that is.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:03.420
Yeah. I'm not too happy with Greg.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:05.340
Yeah, me either.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.569
Look, um...

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.281
you want me to take care of that
wiggly little motherfucker for you?

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.921
- What? - I'll go over there
and kill him for you right now.

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:20.180
I'm old. I don't care
if I go to jail.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.284
They got magazines
in there, don't they?

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.980
Oh.

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:28.121
I thought you were serious
for a minute. Heh...

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.100
You're kidding, right?

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.260
Jesus, Dad.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.620
You know we're at a prison. Okay?

01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:39.140
I do not want you to
hurt Greg in any way.

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:41.483
God.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.049
You know, Grandma told me
that she made a pass at you.

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.321
Heh. Oh, yeah, well, she used to
hit on everybody all the time.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.340
You know the ice-cream
guy, Jerry Miller?

01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:59.810
He was the only one who went for it.

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.740
Oh, God.

01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:06.820
Let's roll. Mom's waiting.

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.970
TAMMY: Oh, God.

01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.700
You don't have to go
in there right now.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.123
Now's a good a time as any.

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.740
- Hey, Tammy.
- Hey, Greg.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:35.980
Come on in.

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.561
- TAMMY: Really?
- Yeah.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.161
Well, see you kind of made
yourself at home, huh?

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.449
Bold.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.964
Uh...

01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:02.220
Just wanted to, you know,
let you guys know that I'm okay.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:03.820
You know? With me.

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.460
Not so much what
you guys did that's...

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:10.820
I mean, you know,
that's really between you...

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.860
and that guy upstairs.

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.900
But I think he frowns on adultery.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.085
I'd say that, so I think
you burn, actually.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:24.404
So I'm just gonna get my stuff.

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:30.007
MISSI:
I, uh... I folded your clothes.

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.300
- So glad you're home.
- Thanks for letting me stay here.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.290
Oh, yeah.

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.060
You look good.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.340
- TAMMY: Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:58.260
- Prison agree with me? Heh.
- Heh. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.444
Think it kind of did.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.020
I got your room all set up so...

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.460
- Yeah?
- DEB: Yeah.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.420
Oh, God. I'm not bunking
with Grandma, am I?

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.660
- No. Heh. She's at Brookview.
- TAMMY: What?

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.900
Did you lock her up?
That is bullshit!

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.180
- Give me your car keys, Dad.
- Tammy, wait!

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:19.650
- I'm gonna remember that when you get old.
- DEB: Tammy.

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:23.971
Hey!

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:28.300
- Hey, super-old guy, where's Pearl Baizen?
- What?

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.370
Oh, God.

01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:35.161
Come on, man.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.460
Grandma.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:41.740
Tammy!

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.220
I didn't know you were coming.
Come here, give me a hug.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.340
TAMMY: Look at you.
It's worse than I thought.

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:50.561
PEARL: Why do you have to go so fast?
All right, everybody. I'll be back.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:53.340
TAMMY: I got the car. Let's go.

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:56.100
- Goddamn it. Ooh.
- I'll get the door.

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.980
You could've killed me.
What are you thinking?

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.860
Just stop. Do you hear me?

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.300
Oh, my God. You can still walk.

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.300
Of course I can walk. I was
teaching an exercise class.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:09.980
Why were you sitting in a wheelchair?

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.180
Because most of them
are in wheelchairs.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.540
Well, why didn't you tell
me you were in here?

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.700
I didn't wanna make you jealous.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.580
I mean, you were in jail,
and I'm at this cool place.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.300
And my AA meetings are here.

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:26.860
I made friends, and I'm seeing
this 84-year-old from Philly.

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:29.601
He was a hockey player,
so he seems younger but...

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:34.361
We've been going kind of slow,
and this might be the weekend.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.161
Ugh.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.580
You look good.

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.620
Thanks. You look great.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:42.940
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.380
I was afraid to eat
the meat in jail, so...

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.291
- That's a good call.
- Yeah.

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:52.940
God. I am so sorry.
So sorry about everything.

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.780
I'm sorry.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:57.660
I was a total jerk to you, and I
should've taken better care of you.

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:00.140
No, it wasn't your job
to take care of me.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.642
Little bit, it was.

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.740
No, I love you so much. I really do.

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.380
Well, I'm pretty great.

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.882
You are really great.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.331
I love you too.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.700
We're gonna spend tonight at
Lenore's and get up early...

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:22.300
- ...and drive straight to Niagara Falls.
- Call me when you get to Lenore's.

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:25.041
- All right, I will, Mom.
- Don't forget.

01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:28.291
- Mom, I've got it, okay?
- DEB: Okay, great.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:32.761
- Stay hydrated.
- All right.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.900
Ah. Okay.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.620
- Well, thanks for fixing up my car, Dad.
- Oh, not a problem.

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:43.966
- Just don't rob anybody in it.
- I'm not gonna rob anybody in it.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.020
Let's light this candle.

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.860
(LAUGHS)

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:51.660
Let's go, woman.

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:54.083
- PEARL: I got it.
- You're strong.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.900
Ooh.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.528
Dukes of Hazzard-style.

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:08.220
TAMMY: Lenore stocked up the RV,
so we're all good to go.

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:11.769
("DO YOUR EARS HANG LOW?"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS)

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.580
Oh, God. It's Jerry Miller.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.780
Ladies. Who wants a bone cone?

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:19.362
- Go, go. Just go.
- Okay.

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.764
PEARL: Ugh.

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:26.900
So, what do you think, Grandma?
It's a good day to go to Niagara Falls?

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.140
I'm ready.

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:33.771
My daddy always said that Niagara Falls
is the closest thing to heaven on earth.

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:52.122
(ALL WHOOPING)

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.540
(LAUGHING)

01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:00.691
Oh!

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:29.446
(MOUTHS) Sorry.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:35.369
What are you doing here?

01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:59.420
So how'd you know to come
here to Niagara, anyway?

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.860
A little birdie told me.

01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.567
- Is the bird named Pearl? Ha, ha.
- Yes.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.020
So, what's going on with you,
Tammy? What's next?

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:10.420
Thinking about getting my
own place in Louisville.

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:12.445
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:15.887
- Interesting.
- TAMMY: Yeah, it is. Isn't it?

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:18.100
Get myself a sweet little place...

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:22.660
and, you know, maybe you can
come over and watch a movie.

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:25.940
Do you guys feel how the
falls are charging the ions?

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.860
- It's incredible, right?
- BOBBY & TAMMY: Yes.

01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.380
- Romantic.
- Yeah, it is.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:31.540
(TAMMY CLEARS THROAT)

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:35.780
Oh. Well, my daddy was right.
It's beautiful here.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.362
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.780
You think I should try to rent a
barrel and try to shoot the falls?

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.420
PEARL: I think we should
just look at them, maybe.

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.980
- Yeah.
- TAMMY: Really?

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.260
I don't know. I got a good feeling.

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.660
I feel like I've been
thinking about a course...

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.700
and if I just shoot out into
the middle soft spot there...

01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:00.260
it'll probably just pillow-carry me right
over that Canadian lagoon over there.

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:04.048
I think if anyone could
do it, it would be you.

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.580
TAMMY: Oh! Oh.

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:10.700
I thought I saw the Cheetos.
It's not them.

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.929
You guys wanna get Cheetos?

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:20.340
- Hey, man. How you doing?
- MAN: Hey. Good.

01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:22.820
- What can I get for you?
- I'm gonna have the iced tea...

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:25.527
and then the full rack
of the pork ribs.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:30.220
The full rack,
that's a lot of sodium.

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.980
You wanna think about going half?

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:35.300
Oh. Uh, no, I'm gonna
get the full rack.

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.700
I'm gonna say no.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.500
I'm gonna say let's, together,
make a better choice.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:43.780
How about salmon? Give you a little cup
of BBQ sauce on the side to spice it up.

01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:47.900
- Better choice, still got zip.
- I'm just gonna do the ribs.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.765
How's your cholesterol?

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:54.260
- It's a concern. It's up there, but...
- Oh, Jesus.

01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.180
- I'm gonna take away the barbecue sauce.
- MAN: Oh, man.

01:34:57.280 --> 01:35:00.060
All right? Poom.
You're gonna thank me later.

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:03.260
- I'm gonna fill that up for you.
- Can I...?

01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.660
I can't believe you're
leaving me for that dick.

01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:09.380
That dick is gonna have his own franchise in
three goddamn years. What are you gonna do?

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.020
Come on, shake a tit.

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:14.140
- Happy hour's over in 20 minutes.
- MISSI: Aah!

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.060
- That's how it's done.
- GREG: This is BS.

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:19.900
This is a huge mistake.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.740
You have got to stop
yawning so much, Charlotte.

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:24.446
- DON: Are you Keith?
- I'm Keith.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:28.881
- Aah!
- Poom!

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:32.169
KEITH: Help me, Charlotte.

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.460
You were right.
This hot tub is awesome.

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.500
Right? Yeah.

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.820
- So how you liking Louisville?
- I love it. I love where I live, where I work.

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.765
I love the man I lay with.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.050
- It's A-okay with me.
- Great.

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.940
Hey, Larry, this sangria is awesome.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.340
Thank you. The secret's in
the maraschino cherries.

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:58.900
Oh. I see you got a couple of
maraschino cherries yourself.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.209
- Oh! Ha, ha.
- Oh!

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:48.300
Pew.

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:49.740
Pew, pew, pew.

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:53.500
Pew, pew, pew. Pew. Pew.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.060
Hey, don't let a deer
hit you on the way out.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.847
You dick. You know what?

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:03.380
KEITH: You are no longer an
employee of Topperjack's.

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:05.882
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:09.848
My secrets! My secret!

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.442
