00:01.935 --> 00:03.936
<i> Previously on</i> Empire...
I have asked Anika

00:03.938 --> 00:06.105
to be my lovely wife.
Bam.

00:06.107 --> 00:07.873
Put your heart and guts
into this company.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.041
Which makes me
the most qualified

00:09.043 --> 00:10.309
to run the company, Dad.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.811
You need to recalibrate
your meds again.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.880
Everything I did was
for you and your brothers.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.482
What you want,
a medal, bitch?

00:16.484 --> 00:18.884
I can't get back the
17 years we lost.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.020
But I'm here now.
Too late.

00:22.155 --> 00:24.723
Come out,
and you're on your own.

00:24.725 --> 00:27.059
We heard you on the radio.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.361
She wanted to
meet her daddy.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.464
I have ALS.
It's fatal. There's no cure.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.733
LUCIOUS:<i> She has to go up</i>
<i> to Chicago overnight.</i>

00:34.735 --> 00:35.968
I can't lose you again.

00:46.980 --> 00:49.014
I'm very nervous
about this.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.215
Stop being nervous.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.417
Here they come.

00:53.386 --> 00:57.056
Andre, get up.
Get up, get up.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.991
MAN:
All right, everyone.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.192
The verdict is in.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.860
WOMAN:
If the verdict is guilty,

01:01.862 --> 01:03.929
you will be cuffed
and led out immediately.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.531
This may be
your last opportunity

01:05.533 --> 01:07.699
to speak one-on-one
with your family.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.002
So I won't get to say
good-bye to my babies?

01:10.004 --> 01:11.070
No, ma'am.

01:12.038 --> 01:13.238
Okay, come here.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.007
Come here.

01:18.411 --> 01:21.413
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.883
But whatever that judge says,

01:24.885 --> 01:28.087
I want you to remember
Mommy loves you.

01:28.089 --> 01:30.589
Never forget that, okay?

01:30.591 --> 01:32.491
Mm-hmm.

01:34.527 --> 01:36.228
I'll never stop loving you.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.030

01:38.032 --> 01:39.331
God got us.

01:40.733 --> 01:41.733
God got us.

He got us, okay?

Hakeem, my baby.

01:46.073 --> 01:49.541
Oh, my God, my...

01:49.543 --> 01:50.876
I love you.

01:54.380 --> 01:57.116

02:27.348 --> 02:30.249
You know you still the only man
I've ever been with.

02:30.251 --> 02:34.653
Well, I've been with
a whole lot of women, Cookie.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.922
But I was always looking
for you in them.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.525
Well, then get rid
of fake-ass Halle Berry.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.527
As long as she's around,
I'm closed for business.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.262
It's either me or her, Lucious.

02:44.264 --> 02:46.031

with me,

Tell me about this
immortal thing.

03:01.147 --> 03:03.215
Gonna produce an album,

03:03.217 --> 03:05.918

musical career.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.655
We'll call it

03:09.657 --> 03:13.058
I'll produce a<i> Legacy</i> concert

03:13.060 --> 03:14.560
Then we'll do a remake.

03:14.562 --> 03:19.064
A song with you,
Hakeem and Jamal,

03:19.066 --> 03:20.499
all singing together.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.900
Wow.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.536
You don't know how
crazy that is.

03:24.538 --> 03:29.141
I mean, we're launching this
IPO as a family-run business.

03:29.143 --> 03:33.145
It is the perfect opportunity
to release a family song.

03:33.147 --> 03:36.148
Yes, you and the boys
singing with me producing.

03:36.150 --> 03:39.151
It is so hot.

but can you please
make one for him?

04:24.431 --> 04:26.765
I don't want
to let him go. Amen.

04:30.136 --> 04:33.772
Hakeem, why are we meeting
at a Catholic church?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.274
Man, Jesus is
everywhere.

04:35.276 --> 04:37.109
You gonna do the family song?

04:37.111 --> 04:39.044
I don't know, man.
I haven't thought about it.

04:39.046 --> 04:42.047
It's like, ain't this weird?

04:42.049 --> 04:44.883
We should be
spending time with him.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.885
Instead, we're thinking
about cutting a tune

04:46.887 --> 04:48.487
and making money
before he dies.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.922
All Dad cares about is
making music and money.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.591
Come on, you know that.

04:52.593 --> 04:56.228
Which is exactly
why we don't get along.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.397
Look, Mal, I know you
got issues with him,

04:58.399 --> 05:02.167
but you got to deal with
it, 'cause in 25 years,

05:02.169 --> 05:05.337
you gonna be in therapy wishing
you done the right thing.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.075
And what about us?

05:10.077 --> 05:11.677
What you mean?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.845
Last time we were on stage
together, it was a mess.

05:13.847 --> 05:17.482
And that's why it
can't happen again.

05:17.484 --> 05:21.119
Look, we just got to do whatever
it is to make Dad happy.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.587
No, you're right.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.160
I was thinking about
not coming out till he's gone.

05:28.162 --> 05:31.229
It's the last thing he wants;
I could do that for him.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.266
So you really want me
on the song?

05:34.268 --> 05:35.834
Yeah.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.436
Come on, we'll kill it.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.171
Let's do it for Dad.
I'll do it for Dad

05:39.173 --> 05:40.272

06:29.189 --> 06:33.658
COOKIE: Yes, and my
handsome, talented boys.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.060
You got to understand,

06:35.062 --> 06:37.028
audiences are staring
at screens all day,

06:37.030 --> 06:39.164
but if I can show
a glimpse

06:39.166 --> 06:42.200
into the soul of the artist,
of what it means

06:42.202 --> 06:43.702
for a man like you and I
to be an artist,

06:43.704 --> 06:46.338
then I've taken
the viewer to a place

06:46.340 --> 06:48.940
that we don't normally see
in a rock doc.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.343
And that's what I want to do
with the<i> Legacy</i> doc.

06:51.345 --> 06:53.278
You got the gig.

06:53.280 --> 06:54.946
Ah, my man.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.282
I also want you to shoot
the White Party for me.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.717
The White Party.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.552
You know, most people
would shoot that for free.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.187
But I'm gonna
charge you instead.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.356
That's a man for you.
I like how you do business.

07:04.358 --> 07:05.957
Hey, baby.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.894
This right here
is Ryan Morgan.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.529
This is Anika.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.230
He's gonna be shooting
our<i> Legacy</i> doc.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.232
And he's gonna shoot the
White Party fund-raiser.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.634
Nice to meet you, Ryan.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.135
Lucious, do you have a moment?

07:17.137 --> 07:20.138
I'll, uh, start shooting
B-roll right away.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.773
Perfect.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.842
I like that cat.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.713
Look, Anika, we-we got
to discuss something.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.415
Yes, we do; and
how about we start

07:30.417 --> 07:32.417
with why you had my
father commit fraud.

07:32.419 --> 07:33.952
What are you talking about?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.954
I just got off the
phone with my mother,

07:35.956 --> 07:38.957
and she said that he's signed
some clean bill of health

07:38.959 --> 07:40.959
for a key man policy.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.961
Look, I...

07:42.963 --> 07:44.596
I did it for the IPO.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.765
I did it-- it was for us.

07:46.767 --> 07:50.335
If my father goes
down for this,

07:50.337 --> 07:52.370
I will take everything
down with him.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.107
(sighs)

07:56.109 --> 07:57.609
Well, I'm sorry.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.743
I should have told you.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.178
Should have said
something to you.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.881
Anything else you feel
like you should tell me?

08:04.450 --> 08:07.486
Like maybe why you screwed
Cookie last night?

08:07.488 --> 08:09.554
(sighs)

08:12.458 --> 08:14.860
(sighs)

08:14.862 --> 08:16.094
Damn it.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.929
(groans)

08:17.931 --> 08:19.698
Baby...

08:19.700 --> 08:22.701
you know I've been going
through a whole lot right now.

08:22.703 --> 08:26.471
And she caught me
at a real bad place.

08:26.473 --> 08:30.175
That does not mean that you
get to hurt me in the process.

08:32.478 --> 08:33.879
I'm sorry.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.515
(scoffs)

08:36.517 --> 08:38.517
I wasn't trying
to hurt you.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.784
I really wasn't.

08:40.786 --> 08:43.255
Prove it.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.691
Marry me tomorrow.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.393
Tomorrow?

08:48.395 --> 08:51.129
Tomorrow.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.732
Why tomorrow? I mean...

08:53.734 --> 08:56.167
I mean, can't we make it
through this weekend

08:56.169 --> 08:58.003
with the White Party,

08:58.005 --> 09:00.438
and then we-we get married
next weekend?

09:04.410 --> 09:06.411
Fine.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.813
But you have to make the
announcement at the White Party,

09:08.815 --> 09:10.815
and Cookie must
be there.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.851
I'll do it.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.654
I promise I'll marry you
next weekend

09:15.656 --> 09:18.890
if you forgive me.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.197
Didn't even cross
their minds to include me.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.066
I feel like I don't even
exist in this family.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.569
Don't even sweat it, Dre.
I got an idea that can turn you

09:30.571 --> 09:33.171
into the CEO of Empire a hell
of a lot sooner than we planned.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.006
What are you
talking about?

09:35.008 --> 09:37.409
Every publicly traded company
has to have a fallback plan

09:37.411 --> 09:40.612
just in case the CEO becomes
temporarily incapacitated.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.746
An interim CEO.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.548
And that's gonna
be you, Dre.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.784
We just need the board to
vote on it, and it's done.

09:45.786 --> 09:49.220
You're gonna have my vote,
we'll have his, Cookie.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.922
We'll need one more.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.958
You got to get
that last vote.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.561
And if I'm the temporary CEO,
it shouldn't be too hard to go

09:56.563 --> 09:58.563
from temporary
to permanent, right.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.564
(hands slap)

09:59.566 --> 10:00.732
Do you feel me?

10:00.734 --> 10:01.866

No, Janet Blakeley.
That's the one.

10:20.887 --> 10:21.886
She's a former model.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.254

10:23.256 --> 10:24.723
She's pretty, isn't she?

10:24.725 --> 10:27.092
I'd say she's about a six.

You're on top of the beat, baby.
You got to pull back.

Yo, like, who is she to tell me

11:13.607 --> 11:14.839

It's Lucious's song!

I'm sick of

Hakeem, get-get
your ass in here!

11:22.382 --> 11:24.616
Always walking away like a little girl.
What the hell is wrong with...?

11:24.618 --> 11:26.718
Yo, yo, Ryan, Ryan, Ryan!
Eighty-six the camera, man.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.353

11:31.324 --> 11:32.524
Eric, make yourself gone.

11:32.526 --> 11:33.625
Yes, sir.

11:33.627 --> 11:34.626
What is wrong with y'all?

11:34.628 --> 11:36.194
He started it.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.463
Nuh-uh, she started it
with all them dumb notes.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.398
That's her job!
She's the producer!

11:40.400 --> 11:42.801
Y'all gonna fix this,
'cause this is not working.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.503
Hakeem, tell your mama
why you're so mad at her.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.305
Oh, my...
I'm not doing this.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.907
Look, cut the Dr. Phil crap

11:48.909 --> 11:50.809
and tell the boy to get
back to work, Lucious.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.243
Wait, no, no, I...
Y'all don't get it!

11:52.245 --> 11:54.079
I'm about to be
dead soon!

11:54.081 --> 11:55.814
And y'all
gonna have to

11:55.816 --> 11:57.749
work together after I'm gone.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.184
And y'all can't work together

11:59.186 --> 12:00.885
if y'all ain't
talking to each other.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.221
Now, Hakeem,

12:03.223 --> 12:07.092
tell your mama why you're always
so damn mad at her.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.261
She always bossing me around,

12:10.263 --> 12:12.764
walking into rooms
when she ain't supposed to,

12:12.766 --> 12:14.933
and then acting like
she running the show.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.335
Well, you don't run the show,
Dad does.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.104
He's 100% right.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.338
And don't act like you ain't

12:20.340 --> 12:21.873
forget about me
when you was away.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.308
But you ain't forget
about Jamal, did you?

12:24.710 --> 12:26.945
You love Jamal more than me,
and you know it.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.646
But it's cool though.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.018
Thank you for your honesty.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.854
That was honest.

12:44.697 --> 12:48.900
Baby, I don't love Jamal
more than I love you.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.470
I just... I just
know him better.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.905
That's all.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.541
LUCIOUS:
Hakeem,

12:56.543 --> 13:00.411
do you think it's possible
that you can...

13:00.413 --> 13:03.114
get to know your mama better?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.717
No.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.620

13:13.894 --> 13:14.959

13:16.896 --> 13:18.463
JAMAL:
<i> You have to realize that</i>

13:18.465 --> 13:22.767
my mom was gone, and my dad
was this huge superstar,

13:22.769 --> 13:26.504
so he was more like a...
like a TV personality

13:26.506 --> 13:29.641
rather than someone
that I actually knew.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.676
But that's why we're doing
the song, you know?

13:31.678 --> 13:37.115
So we can get to know each other
before it's too late.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.784
Think we got it.
That was beautiful.

13:39.786 --> 13:43.021
Thank you.
Thank you, man. Appreciate it.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.659
Yeah.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.795

13:52.999 --> 13:54.432
Hey.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.534

13:56.536 --> 13:59.537
Yeah.

14:00.807 --> 14:03.208
Good.
Cool.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.879
Look, man, um...

14:09.849 --> 14:12.383
You know, honestly, if you
really want to keep your job,

14:12.385 --> 14:16.054
you should not let my
dad know how you are.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.989
Thanks, but your dad
is lucky to have me

14:17.991 --> 14:19.524
doing his
silly little vanity doc,

14:19.526 --> 14:22.026
so if he's got a problem
with me, he, uh...

14:22.028 --> 14:23.461
he can kiss my ass.

When Puff Daddy
used to wear suits,

17:25.979 --> 17:28.579

he was gonna be a CEO,

17:28.581 --> 17:31.215
and if you want people
to take you seriously,

17:31.217 --> 17:32.984
you have to start
dressing the part.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.887

17:36.890 --> 17:38.556
I'm gonna buy you

17:38.558 --> 17:41.092
a fancy white dress
to go with this suit.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.994
Why?

17:42.996 --> 17:45.430
Because I'm taking you

17:45.432 --> 17:47.432

17:47.434 --> 17:50.501
It's time for everybody

18:07.120 --> 18:10.588
Did either of you see that movie
about Stephen Hawking?

18:10.590 --> 18:14.959
Mm, I don't like to see movies
about kids on the short bus.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.361
(laughs)

18:17.363 --> 18:19.764
She's kidding.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.400
Stephen Hawking
suffers from ALS.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.534
That's a very,

18:23.536 --> 18:24.535
uh, serious disease.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.703
I'm sorry, did you say

18:25.705 --> 18:27.138
Stephen Hawking has ALS?

18:27.140 --> 18:28.139
That's right.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.074
Really? How has he lived

18:30.076 --> 18:31.142
for so long?

18:31.144 --> 18:33.111
HAROLD:
He has a very rare form

18:33.113 --> 18:35.913
that, uh, you can survive with.

18:35.915 --> 18:39.317
So he's totally paralyzed,
but it doesn't affect his mind?

18:39.319 --> 18:41.252
He's still sharp as they come.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.653
What was so interesting

18:42.655 --> 18:46.090
in the movie was
that, even with ALS,

18:46.092 --> 18:48.392
he can still
get an erection.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.995
(sighs)

18:50.997 --> 18:54.599
There are some men that,
uh, can't be held back,

18:54.601 --> 18:56.067
even by a wheelchair.

18:56.069 --> 18:58.069
Mm.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.104
No, they cannot.

you down, sir.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.288

tomorrow at the meeting.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.289
Bye.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.492
How you feeling?

19:21.494 --> 19:23.961
Never better, Andre.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.031
Well, no harm, no foul.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.833
I just got Carl Johnson.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.835
Great.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.272
Are you sure you don't
need me to sleep with him?

19:34.274 --> 19:38.209
Or his brother
or cousin or mom, dad?

19:38.211 --> 19:40.144
I thought you
liked our games.

19:40.146 --> 19:43.814
Tonight just...

19:43.816 --> 19:45.483
made me sick.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.884
(chuckles)
Literally.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.654
So maybe you could
just be a man,

19:49.656 --> 19:51.289
and get this done on your own,

19:51.291 --> 19:54.025
and not turn your wife
into a geriatric whore.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.527
'Cause I am so over it.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.219
Yes, I do.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.321
I got to talk to you
about something.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.156
Okay.
I need to go last

20:25.158 --> 20:27.158
on that family song
instead of Jamal.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.393
I thought you didn't mind
he went last.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.729
You favor Jamal over
me all the time.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.930
For once, it'll
make me feel good

20:32.932 --> 20:34.165

Jamal and Lucious

20:43.176 --> 20:46.410
and see how everybody
feels about it.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.379
God, I don't want
your brother mad at me.

20:48.381 --> 20:52.350
But... I think you would be
great last, too.

For my dad.

You, uh... you ever date girls?

Of course he does.

Yes, sir.

You just... you don't really
seem bothered by it though.

21:50.910 --> 21:54.078
And... and I don't.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.181
This is just
who you are.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.482
Do it for yourself.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.584
Do it for your daughter.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.999
No.

You want to play

22:17.036 --> 22:19.470

and this dude right here?

22:19.472 --> 22:21.372
No.
No?

22:21.374 --> 22:23.140
Well, what do you want to do?

22:23.142 --> 22:25.443
I mean, I'm down to do
whatever you want to do.

22:25.445 --> 22:28.179
I want Mommy.
Is she coming back?

22:28.181 --> 22:30.281
Yeah, she coming back.

22:33.618 --> 22:35.820
But for now, I'm
gonna protect you.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.488
Even from the monsters?

22:37.490 --> 22:39.724
Yeah, especially from
the monsters.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.959
Hey, come here; look at me.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.995
Whenever you get scared,

22:44.997 --> 22:48.032
just curl your mouth like that
and you just go, "Roar!"

22:48.034 --> 22:50.167
Roar! Come on, girl,
show me what you got.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.202
Roar!

22:51.204 --> 22:52.470
Roar!

22:52.472 --> 22:54.305

22:54.307 --> 22:56.307

23:02.815 --> 23:05.015

Ladies and gentlemen,
as the acting CFO,

23:58.371 --> 23:59.904
I think I would be
the most qualified

23:59.906 --> 24:01.472
to be the interim
head of the company

24:01.474 --> 24:02.873
if for any reason
Lucious Lyon

24:02.875 --> 24:04.442
would be temporarily
incapacitated.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.643
I would keep the
business afloat

24:05.645 --> 24:08.379
until Mr. Lyon returned
to his post,

24:08.381 --> 24:10.781
and would handle its affairs
with his exact wishes.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.617
Now we will vote
by each individual board member.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.820

Mm-hmm?

25:05.137 --> 25:06.971
We need to talk
about the song.

25:06.973 --> 25:10.641
Um, Hakeem wants his verse
to go last,

25:10.643 --> 25:12.309
and I'm inclined
to give it to him

25:12.311 --> 25:13.777
unless you have
a problem with it.

25:13.779 --> 25:15.212
Well, I do.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.780
I mean, you're my
manager, not his.

25:16.782 --> 25:18.315
I know.
Is this Dad?

25:18.317 --> 25:21.452
No! No, it's all me.

25:21.454 --> 25:23.454
Mal, you know Hakeem and I

25:23.456 --> 25:25.189
are starting to have
a relationship,

25:25.191 --> 25:28.025
and I just really don't want
this to come in between it.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.660
Yeah, Ma, I get that,
but Hakeem told me

25:29.662 --> 25:31.462
that he wouldn't act a fool
if I did the song.

25:31.464 --> 25:32.630
And, of course, he lied.

25:32.632 --> 25:33.831
That's messed up.
(sighs)

25:33.833 --> 25:36.367
Jamal, stop.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.470
You know what?

25:39.472 --> 25:42.139
Your father should go last.

25:42.141 --> 25:45.876
Yeah, I'll call Hakeem, and I'll
tell him that Lucious goes last.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.077
Nobody else.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.479
(clears throat)

25:48.481 --> 25:50.014
Y'all messing around again?

25:50.016 --> 25:52.850
Mm, why would you say that?

25:52.852 --> 25:54.585
Oh, my God, y'all are.

25:54.587 --> 25:56.220
(sighs)

25:56.222 --> 25:57.922
You two hitting?

25:57.924 --> 26:00.324
Well, it wouldn't
be the first time.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.893
(sighs)
Mom, I'm telling you right now,

26:02.895 --> 26:04.428
just be careful.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.430
You do not want to love that man.
Why not?

26:06.432 --> 26:09.033
Because he's incapable
of loving anybody but himself.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.335
And you can tell Hakeem first,
second, last, I don't care.

26:11.337 --> 26:12.670

announcement to make.

26:31.022 --> 26:33.524
What is this announcement
that she has to make?

26:33.526 --> 26:35.092
And why is
she even here?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.694
Look, I wanted to tell you...

26:36.696 --> 26:37.695
Tell me what?

26:37.697 --> 26:39.363
It's not gonna happen.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.498
I'm not calling it off.

26:42.701 --> 26:45.436
So you're gonna
marry her?

26:45.438 --> 26:48.539
That's the announcement.

26:48.541 --> 26:50.774
We're moving up the wedding.

26:50.776 --> 26:51.976
When?

26:51.978 --> 26:54.645
Next week.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.848

I already know.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.267

27:50.269 --> 27:52.202
But did he tell you
about the big reunion

27:52.204 --> 27:54.538
we had last night in the
studio on the soundboard?

27:54.540 --> 27:56.473
Oh.

27:56.475 --> 27:57.875
No. Hmm.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.710
Of course not.

27:59.712 --> 28:02.513
Must have been after he promised
he would never do it again.

Wish I could say
the same for you.

Come on, Cookie, don't be like that.
Hakeem,

29:01.741 --> 29:04.007
it is obvious you're seeing
old Camilla here

29:04.009 --> 29:05.609
because I wasn't around,

29:05.611 --> 29:07.411
but I'm here now, baby.
You need to be dating

29:07.413 --> 29:08.712
girls your own age.
No.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.280
I want some grandbabies.

29:10.282 --> 29:11.682

You're older than I am.

Auntie Camilla.

Plus, I don't date boys
half my age.

29:17.857 --> 29:21.058
You need to stay your tired ass
away from my son.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.526
Chill out, Mom.

29:22.528 --> 29:24.461
This what I was talking
about you being bossy.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.230
Look, I'm gonna
date who I want.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.632
If you ain't with that,
you ain't with me.

you're not gonna use his track.

29:34.873 --> 29:37.608
Oh, I get it.

29:37.610 --> 29:38.876
So Yoko Ono here

29:38.878 --> 29:41.111
wants to play on the song, too.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.646
Well, what can you do, Yoko?

29:42.648 --> 29:44.148
Can you play the tambourine?

29:44.150 --> 29:45.716
Don't mess with me, Cookie.

29:45.718 --> 29:47.751
I'm not one of
your jailbird mates, okay?

29:47.753 --> 29:50.320
Mm, I wish you were.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.222
You probably would've made
a good bitch for me.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.991
You look like you got
a long tongue.

29:53.993 --> 29:56.160
I'll tell you what.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.595
You enjoy your little playtime
with my son,

29:58.597 --> 30:00.397
but my baby is a superstar,

30:00.399 --> 30:03.934
and he ain't settling
for no cougar bitch

30:03.936 --> 30:07.004
who's clearly taking advantage
of his mommy issues.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.605
Have your little
fun, boo-boo.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.574
At least I got
the junior, bitch.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.643
You're off that song.

30:16.614 --> 30:18.782
What the hell happened?

30:18.784 --> 30:21.351
He thinks that we're trying
to plot behind his back.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.020
You told me he was
okay with this.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.621
Look, I never
spoke to him about it,

30:24.623 --> 30:25.923
but I never thought
for one second

30:25.925 --> 30:27.157
he's not gonna vote for you.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.926
Don't worry about it.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.594
I'll take care of it.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.831
It's what I do.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.500
Andre?

30:36.502 --> 30:39.436
That Yoko bitch is screwing up
my whole album.

30:39.438 --> 30:40.871
It's her fault.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.372
Why don't you just
drop the song?

30:42.374 --> 30:44.708
Don't nobody even
want to do it anymore.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.777
Mal, I am not
dropping the song.

30:46.779 --> 30:48.946
Can I just use your verse?

30:48.948 --> 30:50.180
Nah.
It's not a family song

30:50.182 --> 30:53.350
unless the family
sings on it, Jamal.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.152
She's right, Mal.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.120
It's not family
unless you're on it.

30:57.122 --> 31:00.190
Oh, now you want
to talk about family.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.358
Cookie, you put me in...

31:01.360 --> 31:03.427
COOKIE:
Shut up, Lucious!

31:04.562 --> 31:06.496
What do you want to do, man?

31:06.498 --> 31:09.066
What do you want to do?
You want me to do it for you.

31:09.068 --> 31:11.301
No, don't do it for me.
Don't do it for your mama.

31:11.303 --> 31:12.636
Don't do it for your brothers.

31:12.638 --> 31:14.638
You do it for the sake
of the music.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.073
You got to remember,
that's why God

31:16.075 --> 31:18.008
put us on this planet, Mal.

31:18.010 --> 31:21.812
Regardless of how we fight
or we feel about each other

31:21.814 --> 31:23.513
or try to hurt each other,

31:23.515 --> 31:25.849
the music, man.

31:25.851 --> 31:28.518
Music, that's forever.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.521
They'll dance to it forever.
They'll sing to it forever.

31:31.523 --> 31:34.725
They'll be inspired
by it forever.

31:34.727 --> 31:37.928
Put the bad blood behind us.

31:39.197 --> 31:42.232
Tell your truth in the music.

31:46.037 --> 31:47.671
No, you're right, Dad.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.740
Why don't you do a song
for these mugs?

31:49.742 --> 31:50.874
(chuckles)

31:50.876 --> 31:52.776
They'll love you for it.

31:52.778 --> 31:55.679
I-I did do my own arrangement of
"You're So Beautiful."

31:55.681 --> 31:57.247
(chuckles):
Oh, did you?

31:57.249 --> 31:59.049
I did.

31:59.051 --> 32:00.584
I'm serious;
I have the accompaniment.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.785
Well, impress me.

32:01.787 --> 32:04.621
Do it for them.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.690
(crowd cheering)

32:12.063 --> 32:14.865
Thank you, thank you.

32:14.867 --> 32:17.601
Uh, the most brilliant man
that I know

32:17.603 --> 32:19.970
told me that music is the truth.

32:19.972 --> 32:22.439
I'm honored tonight
to be able to use

32:22.441 --> 32:26.810
his music to explain to you all
some of my truths.

MALE NEWSCASTER: Lucious Lyon's
son publicly came out yesterday

35:02.901 --> 35:04.734
in an audacious performance...

35:04.736 --> 35:06.470
FEMALE NEWSCASTER: Hip-hop icon
Lucious Lyon's son, Jamal,

35:06.472 --> 35:08.939
confirmed he was gay after
changing the lyric to one of

35:08.941 --> 35:10.607
his father's most famous songs.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.510
(overlapping newscasts
in multiple languages)

35:14.946 --> 35:16.546
FEMALE NEWSCASTER:
...changing the lyric

35:16.548 --> 35:18.281
to one of his father's
most famous songs.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.593
Have you heard
from your brother?

35:29.595 --> 35:30.961
No.

35:30.963 --> 35:32.429
It's getting
worldwide coverage now.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.564
He should have warned us
he was gonna do it.

35:34.566 --> 35:37.267
It was
irresponsible of him.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.269
What was irresponsible

35:39.271 --> 35:42.405
was you two campaigning
behind my back.

35:42.407 --> 35:45.275
Can't believe you didn't think
that Andre would be

35:45.277 --> 35:47.144
the most obvious choice
to take over the company.

35:47.146 --> 35:48.411
Never crossed my mind.

35:48.413 --> 35:49.913
You know, a lot of things

35:49.915 --> 35:52.015
haven't been crossing
your mind lately.

35:52.017 --> 35:55.252
I'm starting to wonder
where your loyalty lies, Vernon.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.686
Are you seriously gonna sit here
and look me

35:56.688 --> 35:57.821
in the eye and tell me that?

35:57.823 --> 35:59.122
If you'll excuse me,

35:59.124 --> 36:00.924
I need a moment with my son.

36:09.267 --> 36:11.101
And you...

36:12.270 --> 36:15.605
I voted against you because...

36:15.607 --> 36:17.607
I can't trust you.

36:17.609 --> 36:20.177
Why don't you trust me, Dad?

36:20.179 --> 36:23.780
The moment you brought
that white woman into my house,

36:23.782 --> 36:25.949
I knew then
I couldn't trust you.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.951
I knew then that you didn't want

36:27.953 --> 36:29.653
to be a part
of my family.

36:29.655 --> 36:32.189
She has nothing to do with this,
and you know it.

36:33.691 --> 36:37.060
You know why my family hates me?

36:37.062 --> 36:39.863
I know why.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.831
Because I'm not talented.

36:41.833 --> 36:43.700
Not the way you want, right?

36:46.037 --> 36:49.005
Because I studied in school
and got good grades

36:49.007 --> 36:51.808
and went to college.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.177
You hate me
because I want to be accepted?

36:54.179 --> 36:57.147
And they will never accept you!

36:57.149 --> 36:59.849
They will accept
your money, Dre,

36:59.851 --> 37:02.185
but they will never accept
your black ass.

37:02.187 --> 37:05.522
And I don't give a damn
how many white women you marry.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.457
They will never accept you!

37:08.526 --> 37:10.660
This is
a family business,

37:10.662 --> 37:13.697
and I swear before God,

37:13.699 --> 37:17.434
I'm gonna leave it to somebody
who cares about my family,

37:17.436 --> 37:19.669
not someone who's trying
to tear it apart.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.408
I hear you.

37:27.345 --> 37:30.280
Loud and clear.

37:30.282 --> 37:31.615
(knock at door)

37:31.617 --> 37:33.049
Open up.

37:33.051 --> 37:34.517
You famous, huh?

37:34.519 --> 37:36.286
And you stupid.

37:36.288 --> 37:38.188
It's crazy, huh?

37:38.190 --> 37:40.557
You want something to eat?

37:40.559 --> 37:42.559
Nah, I'm good.

37:42.561 --> 37:45.895
Look, my bad on asking Cookie
to make me go last.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.597
Yeah, fool.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.065
I thought you wasn't gonna
fight with me no more.

37:49.067 --> 37:51.134
I know, but Camilla
got me all hype.

37:51.136 --> 37:52.936
But I'll still do the song

37:52.938 --> 37:54.471
if you want to.

37:54.473 --> 37:56.106
Look, I don't care
who go last no more.

37:56.108 --> 37:58.742
Then why don't we both
do a chorus together?

37:58.744 --> 38:00.377
Yeah, that'd be crazy.

38:00.379 --> 38:01.711
But truth be told,

38:01.713 --> 38:03.380
I ain't come here
to talk about that--

38:03.382 --> 38:06.082
the song or Empire,
none of that.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.084
I came, brother to brother,

38:08.086 --> 38:11.154
to tell you how proud
I am of you.

38:11.156 --> 38:13.590
You don't think
it was a mistake?

38:13.592 --> 38:15.625
Not at all.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.495

40:18.382 --> 40:21.117
Well...

40:21.119 --> 40:24.888
Anika was supposed to meet me
at the wedding planner's.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.623
Well, poor girl
probably realized

40:26.625 --> 40:28.892
you was never gonna
stop lying to her.

40:28.894 --> 40:31.394
Look, Cookie,
what happened between us

40:31.396 --> 40:33.897
was a momentary weakness,

40:33.899 --> 40:35.899
and it will never happen again.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.901
I'm not leaving Anika for you.

40:37.903 --> 40:41.671
That is fine by me, Lucious.

40:43.574 --> 40:46.443
Nothing good can come
from loving you.

40:47.711 --> 40:51.147
Except for my three babies.

40:51.149 --> 40:54.684
Now I'm gonna focus on someone
who really loves me.

40:57.922 --> 41:00.790
Splendid boy.

41:00.792 --> 41:04.394
He came out to the world,
and nothing changed, Lucious.

41:04.396 --> 41:06.396
You're still you.

41:06.398 --> 41:08.064
He's still Jamal.

41:08.066 --> 41:09.666
The whole world knows.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.000
No one cares.

41:11.002 --> 41:13.069
The world is still spinning,
Lucious.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.472
No one cares
that he's gay.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.774
But I do.

41:17.776 --> 41:20.910
