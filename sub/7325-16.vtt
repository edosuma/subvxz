WEBVTT

00:02.173 --> 00:03.434
(Meredith) THERE IS
A PROCEDURE TO TREAT EPILEPSY

00:03.434 --> 00:06.037
THAT INVOLVES SURGICALLY
SEVERING THE CONNECTION

00:06.037 --> 00:08.039
BETWEEN THE LEFT
AND RIGHT BRAIN.

00:08.039 --> 00:12.343
THE GOAL IS TO BLOCK SIGNALS
THAT CAUSE SEIZURES.

00:12.343 --> 00:13.614
(Esthero's "Never Gonna
Let You Go" playing)

00:13.614 --> 00:14.785
A PACKET?

00:14.785 --> 00:16.147
WE'RE GONNA CONVINCE
THESE PEOPLE

00:16.147 --> 00:18.219
TO GIVE US $175 MILLION
WITH A PACKET?

00:18.219 --> 00:20.151
IT'S A NICE PACKET.

00:20.151 --> 00:21.652
MER, OWEN STOPPED CALLING.

00:21.652 --> 00:23.294
IF THIS DOESN'T WORK,

00:23.294 --> 00:25.126
HE'LL NEVER
SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

00:25.126 --> 00:27.058
ONCE WE BUY THE HOSPITAL,
THE SNEAKING AROUND STOPS.

00:27.058 --> 00:29.500
AND ONCE OWEN FINDS OUT
WHAT WE DID,

00:29.500 --> 00:31.031
HE'S GONNA BE
THE HAPPIEST OF ALL.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.134
DEREK IS COMPLETELY CONVIN--

00:33.134 --> 00:34.335
THE PROBLEM IS,

00:34.335 --> 00:36.367
THIS ALSO CUTS OFF
THE BRAIN'S ABILITY

00:36.367 --> 00:38.139
TO COMMUNICATE WITH ITSELF.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.610
HEY.
HI.

00:39.610 --> 00:41.272
GOOD MORNING.

00:41.272 --> 00:43.444
THE LEFT SIDE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT THE RIGHT SIDE IS UP TO.

00:43.444 --> 00:44.775
(clank)

00:44.775 --> 00:46.117
THE PATIENT
MAY EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS

00:46.117 --> 00:48.619
WITH COORDINATION...

00:48.619 --> 00:51.082
MEMORY, SPEECH.

00:51.082 --> 00:52.283
OKAY, REALLY?

00:52.283 --> 00:53.654
IT'S BEEN A WEEK.
(box thuds)

00:53.654 --> 00:55.456
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

00:55.456 --> 00:56.787
YOU WALK OUT,
NO WARNING,

00:56.787 --> 00:58.289
AND NOW THE HOSPITAL'S
FALLING APART.

00:58.289 --> 01:00.091
YESTERDAY A BUNCH
OF NURSES WALKED.

01:00.091 --> 01:02.493
WE LOST LAB TECHS,
SUPPORT STAFF.
WHAT?

01:02.493 --> 01:04.765
I MEAN, IF YOU WANTED TO SCREW
THE PEGASUS DEAL, SUCCESS,

01:04.765 --> 01:06.267
HIGH FIVE.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.139
BUT NOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING
THAT WITHOUT A BUYER,

01:08.139 --> 01:10.501
THE WHOLE PLACE COULD GO
BELLY-UP IN A MONTH.

01:10.501 --> 01:12.103
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO DO?

01:12.103 --> 01:13.073
WE--

01:13.073 --> 01:14.845
CRISTINA.

01:14.845 --> 01:17.508
♪ I DON'T WANNA LET YOU GO,
NO, OH, OH, OH ♪

01:17.508 --> 01:19.079
FINE. WHATEVER.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.852
IT'S A DRASTIC SOLUTION
THAT'S ONLY CONSIDERED

01:21.852 --> 01:24.415
WHEN ALL OTHER OPTIONS
HAVE FAILED,

01:24.415 --> 01:27.358
BECAUSE ONCE A SURGEON
MAKES THAT CUT,

01:27.358 --> 01:29.520
THERE'S NO GOING BACK.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.593
(indistinct conversations)

01:32.593 --> 01:34.125
SHANE, HAVE YOU SEEN
THE CHIEF?

01:34.125 --> 01:35.696
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT OVER...

01:35.696 --> 01:37.428
(supplies clatter)

01:37.428 --> 01:39.099
I'M TOO YOUNG
TO BE THIS TIRED.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.202
AT LEAST WE STILL HAVE JOBS.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.504
STOP SAYING THAT.
HOSPITALS DON'T JUST CLOSE.

01:43.504 --> 01:46.106
RIGHT?

01:48.679 --> 01:51.812
CHIEF,
THE O.R.s ARE OVERBOOKED.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.214
SEVEN MORE NURSES DIDN'T
SHOW UP FOR THEIR SHIFT TODAY.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.745
TOO MANY SURGERIES,
NOT ENOUGH STAFF.

01:54.745 --> 01:56.147
UM, DO ME A FAVOR.

01:56.147 --> 01:57.888
GO BACK UP THERE
AND SEE WHAT CAN BE PUSHED.

01:57.888 --> 01:59.850
DR. BAILEY,
YOU LOOK NICE. NEW SUIT?

01:59.850 --> 02:01.452
OLD SUIT.

02:01.452 --> 02:03.154
BEEN IN THE BACK OF MY CLOSET
SINCE MY LAST JOB INTERVIEW,

02:03.154 --> 02:04.455
SOMEWHERE AROUND Y2K.

02:04.455 --> 02:05.896
(elevator bell dings)

02:05.896 --> 02:06.857
YOU'RE GOING ON INTERVIEWS?

02:06.857 --> 02:08.499
THIS PLACE
IS A SINKING SHIP.

02:08.499 --> 02:10.831
(Owen)
THIS PLACE IS NOT SINKING.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.604
WE'RE HAVING SOME TROUBLE,
BUT WE'RE GONNA FIX THIS.

02:13.604 --> 02:16.167
CAHILL'S CONVINCED PEGASUS
TO COME BACK TO THE TABLE.

02:16.167 --> 02:17.908
SHE'S HAVING THAT MEETING
RIGHT NOW,

02:17.908 --> 02:19.640
AND SHE'S GOING
TO MAKE THIS SALE.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.342
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.774
WHATEVER YOU SAY, CAP'N.

02:23.774 --> 02:25.145
BAILEY, PLEASE.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.247
(sighs)

02:26.247 --> 02:27.878
(sighs) THEY'RE REEVALUATING
THEIR OFFER

02:27.878 --> 02:29.750
BASED ON
ALL OF THESE WALKOUTS.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.252
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE ANOTHER SURGEON,

02:31.252 --> 02:32.923
MOST OF ALL YOU.
ME?

02:32.923 --> 02:34.625
YOU'RE THE HEART
OF THIS HOSPITAL,

02:34.625 --> 02:36.627
THE SPIRIT.

02:36.627 --> 02:38.629
YOU SET THE TONE
THAT OTHERS CAN ASPIRE TO.

02:38.629 --> 02:39.860
THIS PLACE CAN'T FUNCTION
WITHOUT YOU.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.862
RIGHT, BROOKS?

02:41.862 --> 02:43.294
WHAT?

02:43.294 --> 02:45.496
YES. RIGHT.

02:45.496 --> 02:46.937
FINE.

02:46.937 --> 02:48.299
YOU BETTER BE RIGHT.

02:48.299 --> 02:49.740
'CAUSE IF THIS BOAT
GOES UNDER

02:49.740 --> 02:51.242
AND I DON'T HAVE
A LIFE JACKET,

02:51.242 --> 02:52.503
I'M COMING LOOKING
FOR YOU,

02:52.503 --> 02:53.844
FISTS SWINGING.

02:53.844 --> 02:56.247
AND I'M SHORT,
SO MY PUNCHES LAND LOW.

02:56.247 --> 02:57.578
(elevator bell dings)

02:57.578 --> 02:58.879
(indistinct conversations)

02:58.879 --> 03:00.451
(clears throat)

03:00.451 --> 03:02.513
(woman over P.A.) NEURO
RESIDENT, EXTENSION 2-2-1-9,

03:02.513 --> 03:05.386
NEURO RESIDENT,
EXTENSION 2-2-1-9.
(mouths words)

03:05.386 --> 03:07.218
I THINK DR. WEBBER'S
HAVING A STROKE.

03:07.218 --> 03:09.189
(mouths words)
YOU NEED TO GO.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.262
WHERE?
DON'T CARE. JUST GO.
GO NOW.

03:12.793 --> 03:13.894
SHE'S PRETTY.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.266
MOM.
(chuckles)

03:15.266 --> 03:16.367
HOW WAS BREAKFAST?

03:16.367 --> 03:17.528
AH, INFORMATIVE.

03:17.528 --> 03:19.400
IF WHAT RICHARD
TELLS ME IS TRUE,

03:19.400 --> 03:22.303
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO COME TO BOSTON.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.934
(elevator bell dings)

03:23.934 --> 03:24.905
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

03:24.905 --> 03:26.277
OKAY, NOW JUST WAIT
A SECOND.

03:26.277 --> 03:27.538
I'VE SEEN
THE KIND OF GARBAGE

03:27.538 --> 03:29.240
THAT GOES ON
IN A PEGASUS HOSPITAL.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.941
IF YOUR OPTIONS ARE
EITHER WORKING FOR THEM

03:30.941 --> 03:32.943
OR THIS HOSPITAL
SHUTTING DOWN ALTOGETHER--

03:32.943 --> 03:34.445
CATHERINE,

03:34.445 --> 03:36.817
OKAY, THIS HOSPITAL
IS NOT SHUTTING DOWN.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.789
IN UNCERTAIN TIMES,

03:38.789 --> 03:41.392
MEN LIKE JACKSON AND MYSELF
HAVE TO STAND TALL.

03:41.392 --> 03:44.455
WE CAN'T PACK UP AND FLEE
AT THE FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE.

03:44.455 --> 03:47.458
A MAN WHO DOES NOT BEND
TO THE WINDS OF CHANGE

03:47.458 --> 03:49.630
IS A MAN THAT
YOU CAN BE PROUD OF.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.602
THAT'S POETIC.

03:51.602 --> 03:53.764
I'M JUST SAYIN',
LET'S SLOW DOWN

03:53.764 --> 03:56.367
AND SEE HOW THIS
ALL SHAKES OUT.

03:56.367 --> 03:57.538
I DON'T THINK--

03:57.538 --> 03:58.869
MOM, I AGREE WITH DR. WEBBER,

03:58.869 --> 04:00.541
WITH--WITH RICHARD.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.015
(huffs)

04:05.015 --> 04:08.649
I CAN'T SAY
THAT I LIKE THIS AT ALL.

04:10.921 --> 04:12.423
YOU CAN PUSH IT
A DAY.

04:12.423 --> 04:14.385
IT'S A TUMOR SURGERY
ON A LITTLE KID.

04:14.385 --> 04:16.026
RIGHT,
BUT IS HE "DYING TODAY" SICK

04:16.026 --> 04:20.030
OR "CAN'T PLAY SOCCER
BUT STILL HANGING ON" SICK?

04:20.030 --> 04:22.563
I'LL SEE MYSELF OUT.

04:22.563 --> 04:23.964
(exhales)

04:23.964 --> 04:26.837
(woman) DR. GLASS,
CALL THE OPERATING ROOM.

04:26.837 --> 04:28.969
YOU TAKE BOBBY BRINN
IN FOR HIS PRE-OP SCANS YET?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.501
OH, NO, NOT YET.

04:30.501 --> 04:31.842
WHAT ABOUT
JULIE CHANG'S LABS?

04:31.842 --> 04:32.873
JUST ABOUT TO DO THAT.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.045
(telephone ringing)

04:35.045 --> 04:37.578
ARE YOU PISSED AT ME?

04:37.578 --> 04:39.780
WHAT?
I BLEW YOU OFF LAST NIGHT,
AND YOU'RE PISSED AT ME.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.882
I'M PISSED BECAUSE I HAVE
85 MILLION THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT

04:41.882 --> 04:43.784
SINCE ROBBINS WALKED OUT.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.516
YOU HANGING OUT WITH
YOUR BOYFRIEND ISN'T ONE OF 'EM.

04:45.516 --> 04:49.360
I SHOULDA GONE TO HOPKINS
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.991
I'LL GET THOSE LABS.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.724
OKAY, SO THIS TIME, I'LL DO
THE PEDS AND TRAUMA STUFF FIRST.

04:53.724 --> 04:55.295
AND THEN I WILL GO
INTO THE NEURO.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.467
OKAY, CAN SOMEBODY ELSE
DO THE CLOSING?

04:56.467 --> 04:57.628
I-I WAS AWFUL LAST TIME
WE PRACTICED.

04:57.628 --> 04:58.799
NO, YOU WERE FINE.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.831
WE REALLY WANT TO END
ON MY FLOP SWEATS?

05:00.831 --> 05:02.072
(Arizona)
DEREK, YOU DO THE CLOSING.

05:02.072 --> 05:04.475
I'M SORRY. IT SHOULD BE
JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES.

05:04.475 --> 05:05.976
CAN I GET YOU
ANY WATER OR COFFEE?

05:05.976 --> 05:07.438
NO, NO, I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.

05:07.438 --> 05:08.609
COFFEE.
(elevator bell dings)

05:08.609 --> 05:11.642
AND A BAGEL
OR SOMETHING.

05:11.642 --> 05:13.313
(scoffs)
I'M STARVING.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.045
THIS MEETING WAS SUPPOSED
TO START HALF AN HOUR AGO.

05:15.045 --> 05:16.587
OKAY, HE'S A BILLIONAIRE.

05:16.587 --> 05:18.689
ONE OF HIS MINUTES
IS WORTH 40 OF OURS.

05:18.689 --> 05:20.821
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT THIS
MEETING IN THE FIRST PLACE.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.992
YEAH, NICE JOB, STAN.

05:21.992 --> 05:23.954
I REALLY BELIEVE
JULIAN CREST IS OUR GUY.

05:23.954 --> 05:26.627
HE MADE ALL HIS MONEY
IN LATE-STAGE INTERNET MOBILE.

05:26.627 --> 05:30.000
MEDICAL TECH IS THE ONE AREA
HE DOESN'T HAVE A FOOTHOLD.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.763
YOUR FOCUS ON APPLIED RESEARCH,
IT'S RIGHT UP HIS ALLEY.

05:32.763 --> 05:34.505
YEAH, WELL, SOMEONE
SHOULD BUY HIM A WATCH.

05:34.505 --> 05:35.836
(cell phone clicks,
phone ringing)

05:35.836 --> 05:37.368
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

05:37.368 --> 05:39.840
HEATHER BROOKS.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.011
MOUSY.

05:41.011 --> 05:42.342
WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.674
WHAT HAPPENED
TO NOT TALKING TO ANYONE?

05:43.674 --> 05:45.846
I LEFT PATIENTS BEHIND.
SHE'S KEEPING AN EYE ON THEM.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.848
I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING
TO HER.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.849
I'M GIVING HER ADVICE.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.020
OH.

05:50.020 --> 05:52.383
WE'RE ALL SET
IF YOU'LL FOLLOW ME.

05:52.383 --> 05:53.554
(Meredith) OH.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.955
(Arizona) OH, OKAY.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.587
(phone rings)

05:56.587 --> 05:58.759
LEAVE IT.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.832
(crunches) MMM.

06:01.832 --> 06:03.434
I AM NOT THE HEART
OF THE HOSPITAL.
(cell phone ringing)

06:03.434 --> 06:05.566
I'M A CHUMP WHO DIDN'T QUIT
WHEN SHE HAD THE CHANCE.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.367
NOW I'M STUCK CLEANING UP
THE MESS.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.839
BROOKS, YOU GONNA ANSWER
THAT PHONE?

06:08.839 --> 06:10.370
SORRY.
(rings)

06:10.370 --> 06:11.842
OH, IT'S MY MOM.

06:11.842 --> 06:14.545
SHE'S GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH.

06:14.545 --> 06:15.746
LESS ABOUT YOUR MOM.

06:15.746 --> 06:17.077
RIGHT. OKAY. UH,
MELISSA KEYSER, 28 YEARS OLD.

06:17.077 --> 06:19.009
SHE'S A FORMER PATIENT
OF DR. GREY'S.

06:19.009 --> 06:21.712
SHE'S BEEN ON DIALYSIS BUT HAS
EXHAUSTED ALL VIABLE VEINS

06:21.712 --> 06:22.883
AND IS NOW SEPTIC.

06:22.883 --> 06:23.954
WHICH MEANS SHE'S DONE.
HA.

06:23.954 --> 06:25.856
DR. GREY LEFT ME
A HOPELESS PATIENT.

06:25.856 --> 06:27.458
OF COURSE SHE DID.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.890
MAY AS WELL HAVE LEFT ME
A PILLOW TO SMOTHER HER WITH.

06:32.162 --> 06:35.395
(crying)
ARE YOU THE DOCTOR?

06:35.395 --> 06:36.867
MY MOM WON'T WAKE UP.

06:40.871 --> 06:43.974
(baby babbles)

06:43.974 --> 06:45.636
(woman)
DR. GRANVILLE TO RECOVERY.

06:45.636 --> 06:46.977
DR. GRANVILLE TO RECOVERY.

06:46.977 --> 06:49.980
(indistinct conversations)

06:52.943 --> 06:55.045
(door opens)

06:55.045 --> 06:56.416
(door closes)

06:56.416 --> 06:57.988
YOU'RE LURKING.

06:57.988 --> 06:59.720
YOU BLAME ME?

06:59.720 --> 07:01.622
(sighs) I DID IT.
THEY'RE IN.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.994
THE DEAL CLOSES
AT 8:00 A.M. TOMORROW.

07:03.994 --> 07:06.697
SEATTLE GRACE MERCY WEST
WILL OFFICIALLY

07:06.697 --> 07:08.899
BE A PEGASUS HORIZONS
HOSPITAL.

07:08.899 --> 07:10.060
(elevator bell dings)

07:10.060 --> 07:12.463
I CAN'T--THAT'S--
REALLY?

07:12.463 --> 07:14.434
I TOLD YOU
I WAS GOOD AT THIS.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.606
(chuckles)

07:15.606 --> 07:16.937
THERE ARE JUST A FEW THINGS
TO IRON OUT,

07:16.937 --> 07:18.008
SO I'LL FIND YOU
WHEN WE'RE DONE.

07:18.008 --> 07:19.039
OKAY, WELL, I HAVE--
I HAVE A SURGERY,

07:19.039 --> 07:20.571
BUT I COULD--I COULD
COME IN RIGHT--

07:20.571 --> 07:23.644
NO, GO, GO. BE A DOCTOR.
I'LL FIND YOU.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.145
OKAY. HEY, ALANA?

07:26.547 --> 07:27.918
THANK YOU.

07:27.918 --> 07:30.921
(indistinct conversations
continue)

07:30.921 --> 07:32.122
(sighs, door closes)

07:32.122 --> 07:33.954
(Derek) YOU ARE INVESTING
IN AN INSTITUTION,

07:33.954 --> 07:36.687
A REPUTATION, A LEGACY.

07:36.687 --> 07:37.928
BUT SEATTLE GRACE
MERCY WEST HOSPITAL

07:37.928 --> 07:39.960
IS WORTH MORE THAN ITS PAST.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.033
OUR PLAN IS TO BUILD
ON THAT REPUTATION,

07:43.033 --> 07:45.936
TO MAKE SEATTLE GRACE A PLACE
WHERE MEDICAL INNOVATION

07:45.936 --> 07:48.198
IS DEVELOPED AND DELIVERED

07:48.198 --> 07:51.902
TO THE PATIENTS WHO NEED IT.

07:51.902 --> 07:53.944
THAT IS OUR PLAN.

07:53.944 --> 07:56.046
THAT IS THE FUTURE
OF SEATTLE GRACE.

07:56.046 --> 07:58.649
AND WE INVITE YOU
TO BE A PART OF IT.

08:07.858 --> 08:09.620
NEAT.

08:12.563 --> 08:15.195
WE'LL, UH, LET YOU KNOW.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.868
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TAKING US
TO JULIAN CREST,

08:17.868 --> 08:19.900
NOT HIS DAY CARE CENTER.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.071
YOU DON'T JUST WALK IN

08:21.071 --> 08:22.573
AND TALK TO A GUY
LIKE JULIAN CREST.

08:22.573 --> 08:23.904
THERE ARE HOOPS
TO JUMP THROUGH.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.776
THOSE JUNIOR EXECS
LIKE US,

08:25.776 --> 08:28.138
THEY PASS US UP TO
HIS BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT GUYS.

08:28.138 --> 08:31.181
WE IMPRESS THEM,
THEN WE SEE THE MAN HIMSELF.

08:31.181 --> 08:33.584
OH. WILL THEY DO THIS BEFORE
OR AFTER THEIR NAPTIME?

08:33.584 --> 08:34.885
YOU WERE GOLDEN IN THERE.

08:34.885 --> 08:36.947
THERE'S NO WAY YOU DON'T
MAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

08:36.947 --> 08:38.088
I'M TELLING YOU,
ANY SECOND NOW

08:38.088 --> 08:40.821
THIS PHONE IS GONNA RING.

08:42.052 --> 08:44.094
REALLY, ANY SECOND NOW.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.931
(sighs)

08:56.707 --> 09:08.118
(cell phone rings)

09:08.819 --> 09:10.020
YES, I UNDERSTAND.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.121
(Callie, lowered voice)
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?

09:11.121 --> 09:12.282
YES, YES, YES.
I UNDERSTAND.

09:12.282 --> 09:13.654
UNDERSTAND?
WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

09:13.654 --> 09:14.825
THANK YOU. THANK YOU
VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

09:16.026 --> 09:17.327
YOU GUYS,
YOU WERE KIND OF RUDE.

09:17.327 --> 09:18.859
WELL, WHAT DID THEY
FREAKING SAY?

09:18.859 --> 09:21.231
I'M SORRY.
YOU GOT THE METING.

09:21.231 --> 09:22.593
OH!
OH.

09:22.593 --> 09:23.764
(Meredith) YES.
(Derek) OH.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.235
(laughing and cheering)

09:25.235 --> 09:27.067
(cell phone rings)
BROOKS.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.238
BROOKS,

09:28.238 --> 09:29.700
what's the story?

09:29.700 --> 09:31.041
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M ON
BAILEY'S SERVICE TODAY,

09:31.041 --> 09:32.873
AND SHE IS NOT
YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.044
OKAY.

09:34.044 --> 09:35.345
Melissa Keyser's
in septic shock.

09:35.345 --> 09:37.207
HER LAST SYSTOLIC
WAS IN THE 70s,

09:37.207 --> 09:39.149
BUT BAILEY'S NOT READY
TO THROW IN THE TOWEL YET.

09:39.149 --> 09:40.911
Which is why I've been
trying to reach you.

09:40.911 --> 09:42.653
SO I FOUND THIS ARTICLE
ON SURGEONS

09:42.653 --> 09:44.254
CRAFTING ARTIFICIAL ARTERIES...

09:44.254 --> 09:46.256
(door opens, switch clicks)
for patients
with exhausted vessels.

09:46.256 --> 09:49.159
BROOKS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN HERE WITH THE LIGHTS OFF?

09:49.159 --> 09:50.290
GOTTA GO, MOM.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.192
Bye.
UH...

09:52.192 --> 09:53.163
(clicks)

09:53.163 --> 09:56.296
DR. BAILEY,
HERE IS THE WORK-UP.

09:58.228 --> 09:59.830
OOH. (exhales)

09:59.830 --> 10:02.072
MAYBE WE REALLY DO NEED
TO LOOK INTO

10:02.072 --> 10:03.734
THAT SMOTHERING PILLOW.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.235
(sighs)

10:05.235 --> 10:06.737
YOU KNOW...

10:06.737 --> 10:08.909
I ACTUALLY THINK
I READ AN ARTICLE

10:08.909 --> 10:11.882
ABOUT ARTIFICIAL ARTERIES
FOR PATIENTS

10:11.882 --> 10:13.684
WITH EXHAUSTED VESSELS.

10:13.684 --> 10:15.716
REALLY?
TELL ME MORE.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.248
I DON'T REMEMBER MORE.

10:18.248 --> 10:21.051
WELL, THEN FIND ME
THAT ARTICLE.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.393
(sighs)

10:27.297 --> 10:30.831
(indistinct conversations)

10:30.831 --> 10:32.132
(door closes)

10:32.132 --> 10:33.934
ANGRY AVERY RETURNS.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.235
WHAT?

10:35.235 --> 10:36.807
YOUR FACE.

10:36.807 --> 10:38.709
YOU GET ALL MAD
AND YOUR EYEBROWS DO THAT THING.

10:38.709 --> 10:39.870
IT'S CUTE.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.111
(sighs)

10:41.111 --> 10:42.172
(laughs)

10:42.172 --> 10:43.714
IT'S MY MOM.

10:43.714 --> 10:45.215
SHE'S BEEN ON ME FOR YEARS
TO COME BACK TO BOSTON

10:45.215 --> 10:47.748
AND TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE
IN THE HARPER AVERY FOUNDATION.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.750
AND NOW SHE IS RINGING
THAT BELL AGAIN--

10:49.750 --> 10:52.152
THAT LOUD, VERY LOUD BELL.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.755
YOU'RE LEAVING?

10:54.755 --> 10:57.327
NO. I WORK HERE.

10:57.327 --> 10:59.429
DID YOU PREP MRS. PRESTON
FOR THE RHINOPLASTY?

10:59.429 --> 11:01.291
THAT'S BEEN PUSHED.

11:01.291 --> 11:03.894
LEAH SAYS DR. HUNT'S CANCELING
ALL NON-EMERGENT SURGERIES.

11:03.894 --> 11:06.166
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT ANGRY AVERY--

11:06.166 --> 11:07.698
THAT'S THE FIFTH TIME
THIS WEEK.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.842
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS,

11:11.842 --> 11:14.244
BUT MAYBE MY MOM HAS A POINT.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.080
(Alex) OKAY, BOBBY.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.681
SO HERE'S THE PLAN--

11:21.681 --> 11:23.283
WHAT I'M GONNA DO

11:23.283 --> 11:24.985
IS I'M GONNA MAKE
A SMALL INCISION

11:24.985 --> 11:26.987
RIGHT ABOUT HERE.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.218
THEN I'M GONNA TAKE PHIL

11:28.218 --> 11:30.160
AND I'M GONNA STUFF HIM
IN A BAG.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.122
AND I'M GONNA CHOP HIM INTO
A TINY MILLION LITTLE PIECES.

11:32.122 --> 11:34.765
AND THEN I'M GONNA YANK HIM
RIGHT OUTTA THERE.

11:34.765 --> 11:35.996
AND ADIOS, PHIL.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.167
HEAR THAT, PHIL?

11:37.167 --> 11:38.698
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.172
(cheering)

11:42.172 --> 11:46.306
(indistinct conversations)

11:46.306 --> 11:48.138
(lowered voice)
PHIL'S HIS TUMOR.

11:48.138 --> 11:49.309
MM.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.011
HE WAS 6 WHEN WE
FOUND OUT ABOUT THE MASS.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.482
BOBBY HEARD "MAN,"

11:52.482 --> 11:55.215
WHICH, YOU KNOW, KIND OF
MADE IT EASIER TO TALK ABOUT.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.718
THERE'S THIS EVIL LITTLE MAN
INSIDE OF HIM.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.020
DR. KAREV,

12:00.020 --> 12:01.321
CAN I KEEP PHIL'S HEAD?

12:01.321 --> 12:03.153
(huffs) WHEN I'M DONE
GRINDING UP PHIL,

12:03.153 --> 12:05.295
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
A HEAD LEFT TO KEEP.

12:05.295 --> 12:06.957
THAT'S SO GROSS.

12:06.957 --> 12:09.059
(laughter)

12:09.059 --> 12:10.761
(click)

12:10.761 --> 12:12.462
(exhales) JUST ADMIT IT,
DR. HUNT.

12:12.462 --> 12:14.835
MY GUT'S A MESS
BECAUSE YOU SCREWED UP.

12:14.835 --> 12:18.138
ADHESIONS ARE UNFORTUNATELY
A NORMAL COMPLICATION OF THIS--

12:18.138 --> 12:20.510
HOW CAN FOUR SURGERIES
IN TWO YEARS BE NORMAL?

12:20.510 --> 12:23.173
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN THERE
CLEARING OUT MY SCAR TISSUE.

12:23.173 --> 12:25.315
INSTEAD YOU KEEP MAKING MORE.

12:25.315 --> 12:27.878
SORRY I'M LATE.
I HAD TO DO... LOTS.

12:27.878 --> 12:29.950
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA LET
TARDY MARTY

12:29.950 --> 12:31.181
DIG AROUND IN ME, TOO?

12:31.181 --> 12:33.253
WHY DO I KEEP COMING BACK
TO THIS CHOP SHOP?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.385
BECAUSE TODAY
WE'RE TRYING SOMETHING NEW,

12:35.385 --> 12:38.128
SOMETHING WE ONLY DO
WITH HIGH-RISK PATIENTS.

12:38.128 --> 12:39.489
WHICH YOU CERTAINLY
SEEM TO BE.

12:39.489 --> 12:41.031
PICK UP ON THAT, DID YOU?

12:41.031 --> 12:44.134
ANDY, THIS IS GOING TO WORK.

12:44.134 --> 12:45.966
WHAT HAPPENS IF I GET UP
AND WALK OUTTA HERE RIGHT NOW?

12:45.966 --> 12:48.298
THE BLOCKAGES CAUSED BY YOUR
SCAR TISSUE WILL STAY BLOCKED,

12:48.298 --> 12:49.840
AND THEN YOU DIE.

12:51.842 --> 12:54.204
WELL...

12:54.204 --> 12:56.446
YOU COULD'VE LED WITH THAT.

12:56.446 --> 12:58.148
(door opens)

12:58.148 --> 13:01.151
(monitor beeping rhythmically,
suction gurgling)

13:01.151 --> 13:02.312
(door slides closed)

13:02.312 --> 13:03.383
(clears throat)

13:03.383 --> 13:05.255
UH, SOMETHING
I CAN DO FOR YOU, AVERY?

13:05.255 --> 13:08.218
I DON'T KNOW. IS THERE?

13:08.218 --> 13:09.820
WHAT?

13:09.820 --> 13:11.221
I THINK YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

13:11.221 --> 13:12.562
I KNOW MANY THINGS.

13:12.562 --> 13:14.094
(chuckles)

13:14.094 --> 13:15.395
THE KIND OF THINGS
TO GET A MAN TALKING

13:15.395 --> 13:17.127
ABOUT WINDS OF CHANGE

13:17.127 --> 13:18.428
AND STANDING FIRM,

13:18.428 --> 13:20.170
EVEN THOUGH IT FEELS LIKE
THE GROUND

13:20.170 --> 13:22.132
IS ABOUT TO CRUMBLE
OUT FROM UNDER ME?

13:25.275 --> 13:28.308
(clears throat)

13:28.308 --> 13:30.210
(lowered voice) A WEEK AGO,
I CAME ACROSS TORRES, YANG,

13:30.210 --> 13:32.182
ROBBINS, SHEPHERD, AND GREY

13:32.182 --> 13:34.144
ALL HAVING
SOME KIND OF POWWOW.

13:34.144 --> 13:36.146
WHEN I ASKED THEM
WHAT THEY WERE UP TO,

13:36.146 --> 13:37.517
THEY SLAMMED THE DOOR
IN MY FACE

13:37.517 --> 13:40.450
LIKE I WAS DIANE KEATON
AT THE END OF "THE GODFATHER."

13:40.450 --> 13:43.323
HOUR LATER, THEY RESIGNED.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.555
THAT SOUND
AT ALL SUSPICIOUS TO YOU?

13:45.555 --> 13:48.828
(beeping and gurgling continue)

13:48.828 --> 13:51.031
SIR, SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU USED TO WATCH

13:51.031 --> 13:52.963
A LOT
OF "UNSOLVED MYSTERIES."

13:52.963 --> 13:55.065
I SOLVED THREE OF 'EM.

13:55.065 --> 13:56.606
(chuckles)

14:00.110 --> 14:02.342
THIS WOULD RESTORE
SEATTLE GRACE MERCY WEST

14:02.342 --> 14:06.246
AS THE REGION'S LEADER IN ADULT
AND PEDIATRIC TRAUMA MEDICINE.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.948
DR. SHEPHERD?

14:07.948 --> 14:09.379
YEAH, WE'LL LEAD THE WAY
IN NEUROSCIENCE--

14:09.379 --> 14:11.081
A DEDICATED RESEARCH INSTITUTE

14:11.081 --> 14:13.083
FOR THE ADVANCES
OF BRAIN MAPPING,

14:13.083 --> 14:15.155
WITH APPLICATIONS TO
THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER'S

14:15.155 --> 14:17.087
AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE--

14:17.087 --> 14:18.228
MAY I STOP YOU
FOR A SECOND?

14:18.228 --> 14:19.930
WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE
A LITTLE BIT MORE

14:19.930 --> 14:21.091
ON THE FINANCIALS--

14:21.091 --> 14:22.192
INCOME STATEMENTS,
PROFIT PROJECTIONS,

14:22.192 --> 14:24.194
CASH FLOW...

14:24.194 --> 14:26.036
(man)
YOUR ALLOCATION OF REVENUE--

14:26.036 --> 14:28.298
PERSPECTIVE PAYMENT
FOR MS-DRGs

14:28.298 --> 14:30.100
VERSUS CAPITATION INCOME?

14:30.100 --> 14:31.271
(Callie clears throat)

14:31.271 --> 14:33.173
(clears throat) UM...

14:33.173 --> 14:34.474
(clears throat)

14:34.474 --> 14:36.276
WE'VE GOT ALL THAT...

14:36.276 --> 14:37.547
YEP.
RIGHT HERE.

14:37.547 --> 14:39.049
GOT IT.

14:39.049 --> 14:41.211
MARKETING,
CUSTOMER RETENTION PLANS--

14:41.211 --> 14:43.213
IS THERE
A TREND STUDY HERE?

14:53.263 --> 14:54.894
(clears throat)

15:02.302 --> 15:03.974
YEP.

15:03.974 --> 15:05.335
ONE SECOND.

15:05.335 --> 15:08.338
(clicking keys)

15:10.140 --> 15:12.442
I'M JUST RUNNING IT
BY MR. CREST.

15:12.442 --> 15:14.484
MM.
OH.

15:14.484 --> 15:16.416
(clicks)

15:16.416 --> 15:18.448
(sighs)

15:18.448 --> 15:20.290
(Callie clears throat)

15:21.691 --> 15:23.123
(coughs)

15:24.654 --> 15:26.456
(man clears throat)

15:26.456 --> 15:29.229
(cell phone chimes)

15:32.162 --> 15:33.433
MR. CREST APOLOGIZES,

15:33.433 --> 15:35.265
BUT HE'S LEAVING THIS EVENING
FOR DUBAI.

15:35.265 --> 15:38.538
OH.
OKAY.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.970
DUBAI.

15:39.970 --> 15:41.541
WOW.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.274
(chimes)

15:44.274 --> 15:47.247
BUT... HE CAN MAKE 15 MINUTES
FOR YOU THIS AFTERNOON.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.119
GREAT.
THANK YOU.

15:49.119 --> 15:50.450
ALL RIGHT. GREAT.
(Derek) OHH.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.352
(car alarm chirps in distance)

15:52.352 --> 15:54.324
(sighs)

15:54.324 --> 15:56.456
ALANA.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.229
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO HAPPEN THIS QUICKLY,

15:59.229 --> 16:01.491
BUT I ALSO DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO HAPPEN THIS WAY.

16:01.491 --> 16:03.193
I KNOW.

16:03.193 --> 16:06.296
THE BOARD JUST NEEDS TO REVIEW
THEIR COUNTEROFFER AND ACCEPT.

16:06.296 --> 16:07.998
I CALLED AN EMERGENCY MEETING
IN AN HOUR.

16:07.998 --> 16:10.200
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE THERE
WHEN I TELL THEM.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.641
HAVE YOU TOLD
DR. HUNT YET?

16:11.641 --> 16:14.274
THAT PEGASUS IS BUYING
HIS HOSPITAL FOR PARTS,

16:14.274 --> 16:18.478
LIQUIDATING ITS ASSETS,
LAYING OFF ITS STAFF?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.380
I JUST HAVEN'T
FIGURED OUT HOW.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.213
IT ISN'T PRETTY,
BUT WE NEEDED A DEAL.

16:23.213 --> 16:25.115
AND IT'S A DEAL.

16:29.319 --> 16:31.061
(Meredith)
Brooks? What's going on?

16:31.061 --> 16:32.392
Is it Bailey?

16:38.468 --> 16:39.629
UH, IT'S MY FAULT.
IT'S MY FAULT.

16:39.629 --> 16:41.171
EVERYBODY'S GONNA LOSE
THEIR JOBS

16:41.171 --> 16:42.332
'CAUSE I HAD A STUPID IDEA.
OH, NO, NO, DON'T.

16:42.332 --> 16:43.673
NOBODY IS GONNA LOSE
THEIR JOBS.

16:43.673 --> 16:44.674
EVERYBODY IS. BROOKS HEARD IT
STRAIGHT FROM CAHILL.

16:44.674 --> 16:46.376
THE HOSPITAL IS LIQUIDATING.

16:46.376 --> 16:48.708
THE DEAL IS CLOSING
TOMORROW MORNING.
DOES OWEN KNOW?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.080
SHE DIDN'T SAY.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.411
ALL RIGHT, SO CREST
IS OUR LAST MEETING,

16:51.411 --> 16:53.113
AND IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.784
IN TWO HOURS.
OH, NO PRESSURE
OR ANYTHING.

16:54.784 --> 16:56.146
UGH.

16:56.146 --> 16:57.447
(Arizona) OKAY.

16:57.447 --> 17:00.019
WELL, IF WE ONLY GET
15 MINUTES,

17:00.019 --> 17:03.253
THEN WE NEED
TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEM, SO--

17:03.253 --> 17:04.494
RIGHT.

17:04.494 --> 17:06.196
RIGHT, RIGHT. WE CAN'T
JUST SIT ON OUR THUMBS

17:06.196 --> 17:07.757
AND LET 'EM READ
STAN'S BORING CRAP.

17:07.757 --> 17:10.430
NO OFFENSE.
NONE TAKEN.
IT'S INTERESTING TO ME.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.502
WE NEED TO KNOW
ALL OF THIS BORING CRAP, TOO.

17:12.502 --> 17:13.663
ALL RIGHT, SO WE NEED
TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER

17:13.663 --> 17:15.205
EVERY SINGLE QUESTION
HE COULD ASK.

17:15.205 --> 17:16.436
(Cristina) OKAY,
WELL, LET'S DIVIDE IT UP.

17:16.436 --> 17:19.139
STAN, GIVE US ALL
THE BORING CRAP YOU HAVE.

17:21.471 --> 17:23.643
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.315
IT'S TRUE.
CAHILL SAID--

17:25.315 --> 17:27.317
BROOKS...

17:29.579 --> 17:32.522
OKAY. Y-YOU--YOU JUST
CAN'T SAY ANYTHING

17:32.522 --> 17:34.184
TO ANYONE ELSE.

17:34.184 --> 17:36.256
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, IT'S...

17:36.256 --> 17:39.359
PEOPLE PANIC. IT'S TOO...

17:39.359 --> 17:40.660
IT'S TOO BIG.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.732
I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:42.732 --> 17:45.665
THIS MORNING, YOU CALLED
THIS PLACE A SINKING SHIP.

17:45.665 --> 17:46.836
NO, THAT'S DIFFERENT.

17:46.836 --> 17:49.269
I NEVER--NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD ACTUALLY SINK.

17:52.342 --> 17:54.644
YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT,
YOU HEAR ME?

17:54.644 --> 17:56.506
THEY ARE STRIPPING US
FOR PARTS

17:56.506 --> 17:58.548
LIKE A BUSTED ASS TRUCK.

17:58.548 --> 17:59.709
WHAT, AND WE'RE JUST
SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT

17:59.709 --> 18:01.080
BECAUSE YOU GOT
A KICKY LITTLE HAIRCUT?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.582
AND ALSO
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.184
UGH.
I'M GONNA BE SICK.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.286
AND I HAVE A SURGERY.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.758
I'M GONNA BE SICK
IN MY FINAL SURGERY.

18:08.758 --> 18:11.261
THIS IS NOT HOW I WANTED
TO GO OUT.

18:11.261 --> 18:12.592
JACKSON MIGHT BE GOING
TO BOSTON.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.224
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE I--
STOP RIGHT THERE.

18:14.224 --> 18:16.526
I KNOW THIS IS REALLY BAD,
BUT DON'T BE THAT GIRL.

18:16.526 --> 18:17.827
WHAT GIRL?

18:17.827 --> 18:20.500
THAT GIRL WHO FOLLOWS
HER BOYFRIEND ACROSS COUNTRY

18:20.500 --> 18:21.701
LIKE A PUPPY DOG.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.433
I AM NOT THAT GIRL.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.205
(woman) ♪ WE FEAR CHANGE ♪

18:25.205 --> 18:27.477
THEY WERE JUST AWARDED
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

18:27.477 --> 18:28.808
I'D QUIT MY JOB, TOO.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.340
NO, YOU WOULDN'T,
AND NEITHER WOULD THEY.

18:30.340 --> 18:31.481
THEY'RE NOT
THAT KIND OF PEOPLE.

18:31.481 --> 18:32.642
OH, THAT'S BULL.

18:32.642 --> 18:33.813
THEY'RE EXACTLY
THAT KIND OF PEOPLE.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.345
THEY'RE ONLY
OUT FOR THEMSELVES.

18:35.345 --> 18:36.786
THEY'RE PROBABLY POOLING
THEIR MONEY TOGETHER

18:36.786 --> 18:38.518
FOR SOME PRIVATE PRACTICE
OR SOMETHING.
I DON'T BUY IT.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.819
YOU WANT TO START A RESTAURANT,
YOU DON'T USE YOUR OWN MONEY.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.591
AND THEY HAVE NO REASON
TO KEEP THAT A SECRET.

18:41.591 --> 18:43.193
I SHOULDA GONE
TO FREAKIN' HOPKINS.

18:43.193 --> 18:44.494
YEAH,
THAT WAS A BAD MOVE.

18:44.494 --> 18:46.526
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
GOING ON OVER THERE?

18:46.526 --> 18:48.558
YOU GUYS,
WE CANNOT SAY ANYTHING.

18:48.558 --> 18:50.560
NEWS LIKE THIS
WILL JUST MAKE PEOPLE PANIC.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.731
(Leah) YEAH, NO KIDDING.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.132
I'M PANICKING.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.504
EXACTLY,
SO DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

18:54.504 --> 18:56.536
DON'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT WHAT?

18:57.907 --> 19:00.770
(woman) MARCIA LOWE,
RETURN TO ADMITTING.

19:00.770 --> 19:03.142
PATIENT MARCIA LOWE,
RETURN TO ADMITTING.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.315
(indistinct conversations)

19:05.315 --> 19:07.417
YOU HEARD.

19:07.417 --> 19:08.578
YOUR INTERN.

19:08.578 --> 19:09.779
(gasps)

19:09.779 --> 19:12.151
DAMN THAT GIRL. I...

19:12.151 --> 19:15.785
COULD JUST GRAB HER
BY THE HAIR...

19:15.785 --> 19:17.387
(sighs)

19:17.387 --> 19:18.458
(huffs)

19:18.458 --> 19:21.431
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

19:25.635 --> 19:27.667
WHAT'S THAT?

19:28.898 --> 19:30.440
OH, I'M...

19:30.440 --> 19:32.872
GIVING A PATIENT
AN ARTIFICIAL ARTERY

19:32.872 --> 19:35.605
SO THAT SHE CAN
STAY ON DIALYSIS.

19:35.605 --> 19:37.607
KEEP HER ALIVE LONG ENOUGH

19:37.607 --> 19:40.450
TO GET THE KIDNEY
SHE'S BEEN WAITING ON.

19:40.450 --> 19:42.212
MM.

19:42.212 --> 19:44.454
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

19:44.454 --> 19:46.456
WANT TO SCRUB IN?

19:46.456 --> 19:48.358
MIGHT BE OUR LAST CHANCE.

19:48.358 --> 19:49.589
ONE MORE FOR THE ROAD.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.421
(inhales)

19:51.421 --> 19:52.922
(exhales deeply)

19:58.798 --> 20:02.502
I THOUGHT I'D BE
CHIEF OF SURGERY SOMEDAY.

20:14.784 --> 20:16.316
YOU SHOULDN'T SPREAD
THAT KIND OF RUMOR.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.517
IT'S NOT A RUMOR.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.688
I HEARD IT FROM BROOKS.
SHE HEARD IT FROM--

20:18.688 --> 20:20.520
THAT IS A TEXTBOOK RUMOR.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.522
AND IT'S NOT TRUE.
JUST ASK HUNT. HE'LL TELL YOU.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.454
HE'D NEVER CONFIRM SOMETHING
LIKE THAT TO AN INTERN.

20:24.454 --> 20:25.695
YOU ASK HIM.

20:25.695 --> 20:27.557
IT'S NOT MY RUMOR.

20:27.557 --> 20:29.529
HEY.
WE READY TO ROLL?

20:33.563 --> 20:35.805
(Meredith)
AS AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER,

20:35.805 --> 20:37.507
WE ARE CURRENTLY AT 411 BEDS.

20:37.507 --> 20:38.938
(Arizona)
BUT ONCE WE'RE RESTORED

20:38.938 --> 20:41.371
TO A LEVEL I TRAUMA CENTER,
THAT NUMBER WILL RAISE TO 500.

20:41.371 --> 20:42.972
RIGHT,
INCREASING REVENUE STREAMS

20:42.972 --> 20:44.574
FOR BOTH ACUTE
AND LONG-TERM CARE.
(telephone ringing in distance)

20:44.574 --> 20:45.945
PAUSE.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.018
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
THIS IS IN CHINESE.

20:49.018 --> 20:50.680
LITERALLY IN CHINESE.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.482
TELL SIMON I NEED THESE
IN ENGLISH

20:52.482 --> 20:53.983
BEFORE I GO BACK IN THERE.

20:53.983 --> 20:55.325
AND HAVE ALYSE CANCEL
MY TEE TIME AT CANTERWOOD.
RIGHT AWAY.

20:55.325 --> 20:57.026
SORRY. GO.
YEAH, WE'RE ALL VERY--

20:57.026 --> 21:00.430
(raised voice) DID--DID SANDY
TAKE MY LUGGAGE ALREADY?

21:00.430 --> 21:03.032
I NEED MY CHARGER THINGY.

21:03.032 --> 21:04.664
SO WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT
PATIENT CARE

21:04.664 --> 21:06.296
AND MEDICAL ADVANCEMENT.

21:06.296 --> 21:07.637
WE WANT TO BE THE PREMIER
HOSPITAL IN THE U.S.

21:07.637 --> 21:08.898
FOR BOTH.

21:08.898 --> 21:10.570
(woman) YOUR BAGS ARE
AT SEA-TAC ALREADY.

21:10.570 --> 21:11.741
SHOULD WE BRING THEM BACK?

21:11.741 --> 21:13.042
NO, THAT'S SILLY.
MR. CREST, HERE IT IS.

21:13.042 --> 21:15.004
NOT YOU. YOU'RE GREAT.
KEEP GOING.

21:15.004 --> 21:16.576
ALL RIGHT, WE WOULD COMPRISE
THE MANAGING BOARD,

21:16.576 --> 21:18.848
AND WITH YOU BEING THE PRIMARY
SHAREHOLDER, YOU COULD--

21:18.848 --> 21:21.581
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WAIT.
STOP. GO BACK.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.052
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR AN OUTRIGHT BUYER.

21:23.052 --> 21:24.514
YOU WANT TO RUN THIS?
(door closes)

21:24.514 --> 21:26.516
WE DO.

21:26.516 --> 21:27.717
(Cristina) BUT WE ALL
TRAINED AND WORKED THERE.

21:27.717 --> 21:29.058
YEAH, WE KNOW THE PLACE
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

21:29.058 --> 21:30.820
(door closes)
WE'VE INVESTED OURSELVES--

21:30.820 --> 21:34.023
YES. INVESTED YOURSELVES.
I LOVE THAT.
(man) SIR.

21:34.023 --> 21:37.527
(scribbles)
YOU HAVE TOTALLY DONE THAT.

21:37.527 --> 21:40.570
THE SHEPHERD METHOD OF
VIRAL GLIOBLASTOMA TREATMENT--

21:40.570 --> 21:42.071
DR. GREY, YOUR NAME
WAS ON THAT, TOO, RIGHT?
(door closes)

21:42.071 --> 21:43.433
IT WAS.

21:43.433 --> 21:44.604
YOU WROTE THE BOOK
ON, UH,

21:44.604 --> 21:46.676
SCAFFOLD-FREE
CARTILAGE FABRICATION.

21:46.676 --> 21:50.440
FIRST IN YOUR CLASS AT SMITH,
BERKELEY, AND STANFORD.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.643
AND TIM KENNER AT HOPKINS
WON'T SHUT UP ABOUT YOU.

21:53.643 --> 21:55.345
OH. (giggles)

21:55.345 --> 21:57.046
OH, WELL, UM, CLEARLY,
YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.

21:57.046 --> 21:58.548
YEAH, I DID.

21:58.548 --> 22:00.550
WHAT I FOUND IS, THERE'S NOT
A MANAGER IN THE BUNCH.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.592
NO ADMINISTRATIVE
LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE.

22:02.592 --> 22:04.724
YOU GOTTA HAVE SOMEONE
WHO CAN KEEP THE LIGHTS ON.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.596
DR. SHEPHERD WAS
THE CHIEF OF SURGERY.

22:06.596 --> 22:07.927
YEAH, FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.729
THEN YOU STEPPED DOWN,
OWN VOLITION, NO REASON GIVEN.

22:09.729 --> 22:12.532
WHAT MY GUT TELLS ME IS,
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.804
SURGEONS LIKE SURGERY.

22:14.804 --> 22:16.466
I KNOW WHEN I FIND SOMETHING
I DON'T LIKE DOING,

22:16.466 --> 22:18.007
I DON'T DO IT WELL.

22:18.007 --> 22:20.109
THEY'RE READY FOR YOU.

22:20.109 --> 22:21.611
SORRY. I HAVE THREE MEETINGS
BEFORE I GET ON A PLANE.

22:21.611 --> 22:23.473
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH
FOR COMING TO ME WITH THIS.

22:23.473 --> 22:25.575
I RESPECT YOUR PASSION.

22:25.575 --> 22:26.916
I SHARE IT.

22:26.916 --> 22:28.448
BUT I'M NOT FEELING THIS.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.380
GET SOMEONE ON YOUR TEAM

22:30.380 --> 22:32.482
WITH SOME
REAL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE,

22:32.482 --> 22:33.783
AND WE CAN TALK.

22:38.127 --> 22:40.560
MM.

22:47.036 --> 22:48.367
(elevator bell dings)

22:48.367 --> 22:49.539
THIS IS WHAT
I'VE BEEN SAYING.

22:49.539 --> 22:50.700
WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.001
WELL, HE DOESN'T THINK SO.
SO WE'RE--

22:52.001 --> 22:53.372
DON'T. DON'T DO THAT.
DON'T DO THAT, OKAY?

22:53.372 --> 22:54.544
THERE'S STILL SOMETHING
WE CAN DO.

22:54.544 --> 22:55.705
WHAT CAN WE DO?

22:55.705 --> 22:56.906
HE WANTS EXPERIENCE.
LET'S GET RICHARD.

22:56.906 --> 22:58.678
(Cristina) WHAT ABOUT
THE GUY WHO'S CHIEF NOW?

22:58.678 --> 23:00.009
(Meredith)
WELL, WE CAN'T TELL OWEN.

23:00.009 --> 23:01.681
WHAT THE HELL DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE NOW?

23:01.681 --> 23:03.683
WE NEED HIM.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.555
ALL RIGHT, SO IF WE GET
RICHARD AND OWEN, THEN WHAT?

23:05.555 --> 23:07.517
DO WE GET ANOTHER MEETING?

23:07.517 --> 23:08.818
CREST IS LEAVING
FOR DUBAI TONIGHT.
(groans)

23:08.818 --> 23:10.820
WELL, THEN WE DO IT
BEFORE HE LEAVES.

23:10.820 --> 23:12.622
UH, OKAY. WELL, WE CAN'T
ALL MARCH INTO THE HOSPITAL.

23:12.622 --> 23:14.424
WELL, I'LL GO.
I'LL GO GET RICHARD.

23:14.424 --> 23:15.995
OKAY.
(elevator bell dings)

23:15.995 --> 23:18.868
(indistinct conversations)

23:18.868 --> 23:21.831
(monitor beeping rhythmically,
suction gurgling)

23:21.831 --> 23:23.402
(telephone rings)

23:23.402 --> 23:25.705
(ring, receiver clatters)

23:25.705 --> 23:27.577
BROOKS, IF THAT'S YOUR MOTHER
ON THE LINE, SO HELP ME...

23:27.577 --> 23:30.039
DR. WEBBER, DR. GREY IS IN
THE WAITING AREA FOR YOU.

23:30.039 --> 23:31.410
IT'S URGENT.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.782
(receiver clatters)
MEREDITH GREY?

23:32.782 --> 23:34.644
UM, BROOKS, COME OVER HERE
AND ASSIST DR. BAILEY, PLEASE.

23:34.644 --> 23:35.815
WAIT.
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.547
I'M SORRY, BAILEY.
HURRY.

23:37.547 --> 23:39.749
(sighs) WHAT ELSE?

23:39.749 --> 23:43.993
WHAT ELSE CAN MEREDITH GREY
POSSIBLY TAKE FROM ME TODAY?

23:43.993 --> 23:45.695
(instruments clatter)

23:45.695 --> 23:48.197
(lowered voice)
SHE GAVE US THIS FIX.
WHAT'S THAT?

23:48.197 --> 23:50.800
(door opens)
(normal voice)
SHE GAVE US THIS FIX.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.962
(door closes)
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
WORK HERE ANYMORE,

23:52.962 --> 23:54.864
AND SHE'S STILL OUT THERE
TRYING TO HELP HER PATIENTS.

23:54.864 --> 23:57.206
UH, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
SHARING PATIENT DETAILS

23:57.206 --> 24:00.109
WITH SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T EVEN WORK HERE?

24:00.109 --> 24:01.911
SHE CARES.

24:01.911 --> 24:03.843
OH, SHE CARES? (huffs)

24:03.843 --> 24:05.875
NOW DON'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT CARING.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.617
I'M THE HEART
OF THIS DAMN HOSPITAL!

24:09.448 --> 24:11.781
(Owen) ALL RIGHT, THESE
ADHESION BARRIERS WE'RE PLACING

24:11.781 --> 24:14.724
SHOULD KEEP THE TISSUE SEPARATE
WHILE IT HEALS.
(suction gurgling)

24:14.724 --> 24:15.925
(Shane)
YOU SAID "SHOULD,"

24:15.925 --> 24:18.227
BUT YOU TOLD ANDY
THAT THEY WOULD FOR SURE.

24:18.227 --> 24:20.059
RIGHT, WITH A GUY LIKE ANDY,

24:20.059 --> 24:21.961
YOU TELL HIM THE BEST VERSION
OF THE STORY.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.933
SO WHAT HAPPENS
IF IT DOESN'T WORK?
(sighs) ROSS.

24:23.933 --> 24:26.095
WELL, IF IT DOESN'T WORK,
THEN WE COME BACK IN SIX MONTHS

24:26.095 --> 24:27.737
AND WE TRY AGAIN.

24:27.737 --> 24:29.198
BUT WE WON'T BE HERE
IN SIX MONTHS.

24:29.198 --> 24:32.742
(surgical staff murmuring)

24:32.742 --> 24:34.203
(April sighs)

24:34.203 --> 24:35.805
ROSS HEARD A STUPID RUMOR

24:35.805 --> 24:37.807
THAT THE HOSPITAL
IS SHUTTING DOWN,

24:37.807 --> 24:40.850
AND NOW HE'S APPARENTLY
HAVING A BREAKDOWN.

24:40.850 --> 24:43.583
(scoffs)

24:44.714 --> 24:47.116
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
I SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS.

24:47.116 --> 24:48.618
IT IS STILL IN THE WORKS,

24:48.618 --> 24:50.960
BUT PEGASUS IS BUYING
THIS HOSPITAL.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.262
AND NOBODY IS GOING ANYWHERE.

24:53.262 --> 24:54.624
YOU'RE LYING.

24:54.624 --> 24:55.825
HE WOULDN'T LIE--

24:55.825 --> 24:57.697
YES, HE WOULD. HE JUST
TOLD US THAT HE WOULD.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.929
ONLY THIS ISN'T TELLING
THE BEST VERSION OF THE STORY.

24:59.929 --> 25:01.100
IT'S A FLAT-OUT LIE.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.271
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:02.271 --> 25:03.873
DON'T PRETEND
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW.

25:03.873 --> 25:06.275
PEGASUS IS BUYING THE HOSPITAL
SO THEY CAN LIQUIDATE IT.

25:06.275 --> 25:07.637
WE'RE ALL LOSING OUR JOBS.

25:07.637 --> 25:09.639
WOULD YOU JUST TELL HIM
IT'S NOT TRUE?

25:09.639 --> 25:11.140
IT IS NOT. WHO SAID THAT?

25:11.140 --> 25:12.812
CAHILL.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.517
(mutters)

25:18.517 --> 25:22.091
IT'S OKAY.
UH, I GOT THIS.

25:23.152 --> 25:25.094
(instruments clatter)

25:28.127 --> 25:30.660
(door opens)

25:30.660 --> 25:32.031
HE LIED
THEN HE WALKED AWAY.
(door slides closed)

25:32.031 --> 25:34.734
HE DIDN'T LIE, ROSS.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.566
(sighs)

25:36.566 --> 25:37.967
HE DIDN'T KNOW.

25:41.010 --> 25:43.312
(Alex) HAVE FUN IN THE BAG,
JERK FACE.

25:43.312 --> 25:44.644
MORCELLATOR, PLEASE.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.716
THAT'S GNARLY.

25:46.716 --> 25:48.017
YEAH,
BOBBY WOULD LOVE THIS.

25:48.017 --> 25:49.579
WE COULD RECORD
THE LIVE FEED.
(squeaking)

25:49.579 --> 25:52.582
HE COULD REWATCH THE CARNAGE.
SHARE IT WITH HIS FRIENDS.

25:52.582 --> 25:54.824
NAH. HE'D BE EXPECTING
ARMS AND EYEBALLS AND CRAP.

25:54.824 --> 25:55.925
FINDING OUT THE TRUTH

25:55.925 --> 25:57.587
WOULD BREAK
HIS FREAKY LITTLE HEART...

25:57.587 --> 25:59.228
ABOUT SANTA CLAUS

25:59.228 --> 26:01.931
AND HOW PEOPLE GET SICK
AND LET YOU DOWN,

26:01.931 --> 26:04.694
AND EVERYTHING
JUST FALLS APART.

26:04.694 --> 26:07.566
TILL THEN HE CAN BELIEVE
WHATEVER THE HELL HE WANTS.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.798
(inhales deeply)

26:08.798 --> 26:09.939
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

26:09.939 --> 26:11.270
I MEAN, I'M A GROWN-UP

26:11.270 --> 26:12.742
AND I WAS STILL
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

26:12.742 --> 26:14.243
WE DIDN'T FIND ARMS
AND EYES IN THERE.

26:14.243 --> 26:15.805
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

26:15.805 --> 26:17.607
(squeaks)

26:17.607 --> 26:18.748
OH, SICK. (laughs)

26:18.748 --> 26:22.211
(laughs)

26:22.211 --> 26:23.753
WELL, THAT'S
A VERY INTERESTING OFFER, SIR.

26:23.753 --> 26:25.254
BUT I WOULDN'T
BE COMFORTABLE WITH...

26:25.254 --> 26:27.116
REALLY?

26:27.116 --> 26:28.758
THAT'S A--REALLY?

26:28.758 --> 26:31.190
(indistinct conversations)

26:31.190 --> 26:32.692
(door closes)
I WAS ABLE TO DO
SOME REARRANGING

26:32.692 --> 26:34.694
AND GET AVERY'S RHINOPLASTY
BACK ON THE BOARD.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.595
HE'S ON THE PHONE

26:36.595 --> 26:39.098
WITH THE BOSTON CHIEF
OF PLASTIC SURGERY.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.269
(telephone ringing in distance)

26:40.269 --> 26:43.302
JO WAS RIGHT.
YOU'RE THAT GIRL.

26:43.302 --> 26:44.734
(whispers) I KNOW.

26:44.734 --> 26:46.175
(normal voice) WE'RE ALL ABOUT
TO LOSE OUR JOBS,

26:46.175 --> 26:47.707
AND ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS THE FACT

26:47.707 --> 26:49.008
THAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO STOP
SLEEPING WITH HIM.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.379
(elevator bell dings)
I'M SO GROSS.

26:50.379 --> 26:51.911
COME ON. THE SEX
CAN'T BE THAT GOOD.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.913
LOOK AT HIM.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.184
REALLY?

26:55.184 --> 26:56.716
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HIM.

26:56.716 --> 26:57.947
EVERY STEP YOU TAKE

26:57.947 --> 26:59.819
IS A GIANT LEAP BACKWARD
FOR WOMANKIND.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.352
THERE GOES THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

27:03.352 --> 27:04.724
ROE v. WADE.

27:04.724 --> 27:05.855
CUT IT OUT.

27:05.855 --> 27:07.626
BESIDES,
YOU'RE JUST AS BAD.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.158
YOU WERE HUNG UP
ON KAREV FOR WEEKS.

27:09.158 --> 27:10.860
YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE LIKE ME.

27:10.860 --> 27:12.031
YOU HATE ME.

27:12.031 --> 27:14.163
THANKS.

27:14.163 --> 27:15.665
AND I DON'T HATE YOU.

27:15.665 --> 27:17.807
YEAH, YOU DO.

27:19.038 --> 27:21.310
(woman) DR. CHAN
TO THE ISOLATION UNIT.

27:21.310 --> 27:23.973
DR. CHAN TO THE ISOLATION UNIT.

27:23.973 --> 27:26.976
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

27:28.678 --> 27:29.679
(door opens)

27:29.679 --> 27:30.680
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

27:30.680 --> 27:31.851
I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.282
OH, NOW YOU WANT TO TALK?

27:33.282 --> 27:34.954
YOU'RE ABOUT A WEEK LATE.
I NEED TO FIND CAHILL.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.325
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN.

27:36.325 --> 27:37.687
OWEN, IS IT TRUE,

27:37.687 --> 27:38.828
THEY'RE SELLING
THE HOSPITAL FOR SCRAP?

27:38.828 --> 27:39.989
THIS IS THE DEAL YOU MADE?

27:39.989 --> 27:41.190
THIS IS THE DEAL YOU MADE--

27:41.190 --> 27:42.762
YOU, SHEPHERD,
AND ALL OF YOU--

27:42.762 --> 27:45.434
WHEN YOU WALKED OUT ON ME,
WHEN YOU LIED TO ME!

27:45.434 --> 27:47.196
WE'RE TRYING TO BUY
THE HOSPITAL.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.040
SO WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR AN OUTSIDE INVESTOR,

27:51.040 --> 27:53.372
TRYING TO GET THE MONEY
TOGETHER, BUT WE'VE HIT A WALL.

27:53.372 --> 27:54.874
(sighs)

27:54.874 --> 27:56.405
I'M GOOD FOR $3 MILLION.

27:56.405 --> 27:57.777
NO, RICHARD. WE DON'T WANT--

27:57.777 --> 27:58.878
NO, I JUST HAVE TO
MOVE SOME THINGS AROUND.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.249
IT'LL BE EVERYTHING I HAVE,
BUT I AM IN.

28:00.249 --> 28:01.781
NO, WE DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY.
WE NEED YOUR EXPERIENCE.

28:01.781 --> 28:02.952
WE NEED YOU.

28:02.952 --> 28:04.714
I MEAN,
WE'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY, TOO,

28:04.714 --> 28:06.856
IF IT COMES DOWN TO IT,
BUT--

28:06.856 --> 28:07.787
HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED?

28:07.787 --> 28:09.188
$175 MILLION.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.790
(laughing)

28:10.790 --> 28:12.391
(laughing)

28:12.391 --> 28:14.924
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
(continues laughing)

28:14.924 --> 28:16.695
(chuckles)

28:16.695 --> 28:18.227
(chuckles)

28:20.870 --> 28:22.802
IT'S NOT REALLY FUNNY,
IS IT?

28:22.802 --> 28:23.933
NO.

28:23.933 --> 28:25.474
(car horn honks in distance)

28:25.474 --> 28:28.037
SO WE ONLY WALKED OUT
TO STALL THE SALE TO PEGASUS.

28:28.037 --> 28:29.739
AND IT'S NOT OVER.

28:29.739 --> 28:31.040
WE HAVE AN INVESTOR.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.312
WE JUST NEED YOU AND WEBBER
TO GET HIM ON BOARD,

28:33.312 --> 28:35.384
NOW, BEFORE
THE PEGASUS DEAL CLOSES.

28:35.384 --> 28:36.715
YOU COULDN'T TELL ME THIS?

28:36.715 --> 28:38.217
WHY COULDN'T YOU
JUST TELL ME THIS?

28:38.217 --> 28:40.219
I COULD'VE FOUGHT FOR YOU.
I COULD'VE FOUGHT WITH YOU.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.991
I'M SORRY.

28:41.991 --> 28:44.353
I WANTED TO TELL YOU.
I WANTED TO.

28:44.353 --> 28:46.155
BUT THEY SAID YOU SIGNED
NONDISCLOSURES,

28:46.155 --> 28:47.827
AND IF ANYONE FOUND OUT
YOU WERE INVOLVED

28:47.827 --> 28:48.958
IN A COMPETING BID,

28:48.958 --> 28:50.299
THEY COULD SUE YOU,

28:50.299 --> 28:52.261
OR IF THEY WERE PISSED ENOUGH,
JAIL YOU.

28:52.261 --> 28:54.433
PLEASE TRUST ME. I-I...

28:54.433 --> 28:56.936
I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.942
YOU DON'T NEED
TO PROTECT ME.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.944
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
THE BOARD.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.275
IF THEY THINK
WE CAN SAVE THIS PLACE,

29:06.275 --> 29:07.516
IT COULD BUY YOU SOME TIME.

29:07.516 --> 29:08.818
YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.

29:08.818 --> 29:11.180
CRISTINA, YOU NEED
TO TRUST ME, TOO.

29:22.531 --> 29:24.093
(tapping)

29:24.093 --> 29:25.865
(monitor beeping steadily,
suction gurgling)

29:25.865 --> 29:27.837
(tapping continues)

29:27.837 --> 29:29.939
BOSTON THEN?

29:29.939 --> 29:32.001
(taps)

29:32.001 --> 29:34.473
NO. NOT BOSTON.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.506
MY MOM WOULDN'T WANT
TO WIN THAT WAY ANYWAY.

29:37.506 --> 29:39.008
BUT IT'S PROBABLY TIME

29:39.008 --> 29:41.851
TO START THINKING ABOUT
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

29:41.851 --> 29:43.012
(taps)

29:43.012 --> 29:46.816
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHERE ARE YOU HEADED?

29:46.816 --> 29:49.458
I... DON'T KNOW YET.

29:49.458 --> 29:50.789
(taps)
WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW.

29:50.789 --> 29:54.363
WE COULD END UP
SOMEWHERE NEAR EACH OTHER.

29:54.363 --> 29:57.396
THAT WOULDN'T BE
THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD.

29:58.797 --> 30:02.201
YEAH. SURE.

30:02.201 --> 30:05.434
SUCTION, PLEASE.

30:05.434 --> 30:08.537
(suction gurgling)

30:13.382 --> 30:14.813
(man) HEY, BUDDY.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.916
THEY GOT HIM.

30:16.916 --> 30:19.118
THEY KICKED PHIL'S BUTT
STRAIGHT TO THE CURB.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.589
I WISH YOU COULDA SEEN
THE LOOK ON HIS FACE

30:20.589 --> 30:23.492
WHEN I PULLED HIS EYEBALLS
RIGHT OUT OF HIS STUPID HEAD.

30:23.492 --> 30:25.454
OH, DUDE.
IT WAS SO NASTY.

30:25.454 --> 30:28.427
THERE WERE BRAINS
AND HAIR EVERYWHERE.

30:28.427 --> 30:29.959
DON'T FORGET
THE INTESTINES.

30:29.959 --> 30:31.130
HOW COULD I?

30:31.130 --> 30:32.601
THEY GOT ALL TANGLED UP
IN MY TOOLS

30:32.601 --> 30:34.163
LIKE SPAGHETTI.

30:34.163 --> 30:37.836
WE HAD TO TAKE A BREAK
JUST TO GET RID OF ALL THE GOO.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.238
WHAT ELSE?

30:41.010 --> 30:44.043
EXCUSE ME.

30:48.277 --> 30:49.618
(sniffles)

30:49.618 --> 30:51.580
(crying)

30:51.580 --> 30:53.452
(sniffles)

30:56.956 --> 30:59.188
(exhales)

30:59.188 --> 31:00.489
HEY.

31:00.489 --> 31:03.332

31:03.332 --> 31:05.264
YOU FAKING?

31:06.395 --> 31:07.596
JOKE'S ON YOU.

31:07.596 --> 31:09.238
THERE AREN'T GONNA BE
THAT MANY MORE SURGERIES

31:09.238 --> 31:10.569
FOR YOU TO CON OUT OF ME.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.471
(cries)

31:12.471 --> 31:15.945
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS.

31:15.945 --> 31:18.047
NOT LIKE THIS ONE.

31:19.348 --> 31:21.510
NOT WITH A TEACHER
LIKE YOU...

31:21.510 --> 31:24.053
WHO SHOWS ME

31:24.053 --> 31:25.554
COOL TUMOR-IN-A-BAG SURGERIES

31:25.554 --> 31:28.457
AND THINKS IT'S FUN
TO TALK TO LITTLE KIDS

31:28.457 --> 31:31.460
ABOUT GUTS AND STUFF.

31:31.460 --> 31:33.292
YOU KNOW, I, UH...
(clears throat)

31:33.292 --> 31:36.225
I BARELY SAW YOU THIS WEEK,

31:36.225 --> 31:39.028
AND IT SUCKED.

31:39.028 --> 31:42.471
I'LL FIND ANOTHER JOB.
WHATEVER.

31:42.471 --> 31:47.376
I, UH, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

31:49.478 --> 31:51.240
HEY.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.012
I'M FINE. I'M OKAY.
I'M GOOD.

32:19.568 --> 32:21.670
DR. HUNT,
CAN WE STEP OUTSIDE?

32:21.670 --> 32:23.512
(Roberta) DR. HUNT, I'M SORRY.

32:23.512 --> 32:25.144
IT ISN'T WHAT YOU WANT.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.276
IT ISN'T WHAT ANY OF US WANT,
BUT IT IS THE DEAL WE HAVE.

32:27.276 --> 32:29.648
NO, IT ISN'T.
I HAVE ANOTHER BUYER.

32:29.648 --> 32:33.282
