WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:02.518
I can't believe the Yankees fired me.

00:02.680 --> 00:05.433
Well, you had a good run.
You took them to the World Series.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.309
I gotta give the players
most of the credit for that.

00:08.720 --> 00:12.315
Don't sell yourself short. You made
flight arrangements, hotels, buses.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.550
No, I don't know who was doing that.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.678
So when you actually did work,
what is it that you did?

00:19.240 --> 00:21.754
I'll tell you, they had a pastry cart
you wouldn't believe.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.832
Here we go.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.752
Your latte.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.592
Your cappuccino.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.113
Maybe I should ask her out.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.029
- She is a good waitress.
- It's true.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.158
- Maybe I'll take her to the Tonys.
- You're going to the Tonys?

00:38.320 --> 00:41.278
Yeah, I wrote some jokes for the show
and they gave me two tickets.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.477
Why didn't you ask me?
I know a million theatre jokes.

00:44.640 --> 00:49.077
What's the deal with those guys
down in the pit?

00:49.480 --> 00:52.278
They're musicians. That's not a joke.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.034
It's a funny observation.

00:56.920 --> 00:58.433
Severance package?

00:58.600 --> 01:01.433
The Yankees are giving me three
months' full pay for doing nothing.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.989
They did it for three years.
What's another few months?

01:04.160 --> 01:06.310
I'm gonna do something
with these three months.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.596
- Like what?
- I'm gonna read a book...

01:08.760 --> 01:10.830
...from beginning to end,
in that order.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.592
I've always wanted to do that.

01:12.760 --> 01:15.035
- I'm going to play Frolf.
- You mean golf?

01:15.200 --> 01:19.478
Frolf. Frisbee golf, Jerry.
Golf with a Frisbee.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.674
This is gonna be my time.

01:21.840 --> 01:25.469
Time to taste the fruits
and let the juices drip down my chin.

01:25.640 --> 01:29.952
I proclaim this
"The Summer of George."

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

01:41.760 --> 01:43.830
And then Peterman ate it.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.752
I never told him.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.233
- Who is that?
- That's Sam...

01:52.400 --> 01:53.674
...the new girl in Accounting.

01:53.840 --> 01:57.116
What's with her arms?
They just hang like salamis.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.633
She walks like an orangutan.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.631
Better call the zoo.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.712
What?

02:04.880 --> 02:07.075
Catty.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.560
It's like she's carrying
invisible suitcases.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.517
- Like this?
- Yes, exactly.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.432
- That is so strange.
- Right.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.353
So why am I the one who gets:

02:20.520 --> 02:22.670
I mean, they were being
just as catty as I was.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.592
It's a double standard.

02:24.760 --> 02:28.548
Oh, and what about ladies' night?
Women admitted free before 10?

02:29.760 --> 02:31.830
That is so stupid.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.831
Hey, The White Shadow is on.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.396
Boy, you're really packing it all in.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.794
Jerry, my vacation has just started.
I need a day or two to decompress.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.951
- Besides, I did plenty today.
- Like what?

02:45.120 --> 02:47.680
I bought a new recliner
with a fridge built right into it.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.349
Hey, Jerry, you got any TUMS?

02:51.520 --> 02:53.750
- Stomach ache?
- I drank too much water in the shower.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.991
Top of the fridge.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.954
Hey, George, I'm taking
that waitress to the Tonys.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.793
- Shadow.
- Oh, the Tonys?

03:01.960 --> 03:03.518
I'll see you there, buddy.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.716
- You're going to the Tonys too?
- Roger that.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.110
- Where are you sitting?
- Well, all over the place.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.919
I'm a seat-filler. They don't like
to see empty seats on TV.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.072
Somebody gets up, I park my caboose
in their spot until they get back.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.515
- How did you get that job?
- Mickey, he hooked me up.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.875
- Yeah, he's a member of the academy.
- What academy?

03:19.040 --> 03:20.996
Well, he didn't say.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.149
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.153
- Nice tuxedo.
- Thanks. It's a breakaway.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.117
- Should we go?
- Absolutely.

03:32.280 --> 03:35.352
- Lyle, we're going.
- All right.

03:35.520 --> 03:36.794
Jerry, this is Lyle.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.397
- Hey, how you doing?
- Okay.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.879
Bye.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.874
- Have a good time.
- Thanks...

03:47.720 --> 03:49.233
...Lyle.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.068
Are you leaving?
Because I got you covered.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.953
I'll just go ahead and get in there.

04:01.200 --> 04:05.034
Just a minute. What are you doing?

04:05.200 --> 04:07.509
My job. What are you doing?

04:10.360 --> 04:15.275
They catch the two of us on TV,
you might have a little explaining to do.

04:19.360 --> 04:22.557
- So you and Lyle are roommates?
- No.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.038
- Gay?
- What?

04:26.200 --> 04:29.351
- Is he gay?
- No.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.073
Are you sure?

04:32.800 --> 04:34.631
I think I would know.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.470
This is a new one.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.759
Turkey jerky? Go ahead, take a pull.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.358
More for me.

04:49.240 --> 04:54.473
And the Tony for best musical
is awarded to Scarsdale Surprise.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.435
Lewis Maxtone-Graham,
Douglas Ewing...

04:57.600 --> 05:00.160
...Benjamin London,
Polly Kennedy, producers.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.556
- Kramer?
- Thank you and bless you all.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.554
This truly has been
a Scarsdale Surprise.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.193
Elaine, am I crazy?

05:31.360 --> 05:33.271
I just get the feeling that...

05:33.440 --> 05:37.035
...Dugan and the others are
making fun of me all the time.

05:37.760 --> 05:42.231
Well, you might wanna think
about maybe...

05:42.400 --> 05:45.756
...moving your arms a little
when you walk.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.194
My arms?

05:47.360 --> 05:49.555
You know, sort of swing them...

05:49.720 --> 05:55.352
...so you're not lurching around,
you know, like a caveman.

05:57.240 --> 05:58.389
I'm a caveman?

05:58.880 --> 06:00.950
No, no, no, it's just that...

06:01.120 --> 06:04.556
Everyone told me
what a catty shrew you were.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.039
You're horrible.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.074
She had a dude?

06:12.240 --> 06:14.390
When I went to pick her up,
there was this dude.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.438
- How do you know it was her dude?
- It could've been just some dude?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.318
Dudes in this town
are a dime a dozen.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.311
- I reckon.
- Or maybe...

06:21.480 --> 06:23.357
...she just wanted to go to the Tonys.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.988
I tell you what. Ask her out again.
No Tony, just Jerry.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.549
That way you know if the dude
is her dude or some dude.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.029
- Dude.
- Yeah.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.033
All right, that's enough.
I gotta go home and take a nap.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.428
It's 10:30 in the morning.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.591
What can I tell you, I'm wiped.

06:37.760 --> 06:41.070
So has the Summer of George begun,
or are you still decomposing?

06:41.560 --> 06:43.357
Decompressing.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.910
Well, good morning, gentlemen,
and Tony says hello to you.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.674
- You didn't give that thing back?
- Jerry, it was a whirlwind.

06:52.840 --> 06:56.230
They whisk us backstage.
The media is swarming.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.709
Champagne is flowing.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.189
I can't describe
how great it is to win.

07:01.360 --> 07:02.998
That's because you didn't win.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.559
Scarsdale Surprise.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.757
That's the musical about
the Scarsdale diet doctor murder.

07:07.920 --> 07:12.710
Featuring the mind-blowing
performance of Miss Raquel Welch.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.233
You haven't even seen it.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.790
Oh, Jerry, I'm not gonna let you
bring me down off this high.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.393
I've been partying all night.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.551
I saw the sun rise at Liza's.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.030
- Minnelli's?
- No.

07:26.960 --> 07:30.794
Sam, listen. I am so sorry
about the other day.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.190
No, don't apologize, Elaine.

07:33.360 --> 07:37.069
I was thinking that maybe I should
swing my arms a little bit more.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.399
See, yeah, I mean,
that's all I was saying.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.278
How's this?

07:43.600 --> 07:46.876
Or this? Or this?

07:47.040 --> 07:50.715
- Or this? Or this?
- Well...

07:50.880 --> 07:52.950
...you seem to be
getting the hang of it.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.433
- Hi.
- Sorry, I'm running late.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.319
- I just lost track of time.
- No rush.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.478
Hey, Jerr, what's up?

08:05.680 --> 08:08.274
I have absolutely no idea.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.718
Can you believe she expected me
to squire her around town...

08:15.880 --> 08:18.394
...while the dude sits at home
in swaddling clothes?

08:18.640 --> 08:21.108
Do they make swaddling clothes
for adults?

08:21.280 --> 08:23.669
It's like she's put the role
of boyfriend into two jobs.

08:23.840 --> 08:25.558
Except the dude's playing
the showroom...

08:25.720 --> 08:27.790
...and I'm stuck doing
food and beverage.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.757
- Hey.
- Who's that?

08:29.920 --> 08:32.229
- It's Kramer.
- Hey, Kramer.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.153
- George says hi.
- Hi, George.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.799
How's that Tony?

08:36.960 --> 08:38.678
Why don't you just come over here?

08:38.840 --> 08:40.477
Why can't I do this on the phone?

08:40.640 --> 08:43.200
- What's Kramer doing now?
- He's looking in the refrigerator.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.796
Kramer. Anything good in there?
Any Popsicles?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.234
I cannot do this.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.675
- So, what's George doing?
- He's not doing anything.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.633
Goodbye.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.273
I'm gonna grab a bite to eat at Sardi's.
You wanna go?

08:56.440 --> 08:58.158
Are you taking the Tony to Sardi's?

08:58.320 --> 09:01.153
The Tony is taking me to Sardi's.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.075
Oh, hello.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.800
- Well, I'm going.
- Congratulations.

09:08.960 --> 09:12.635
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.758
I have so many people I want to thank.
I don't want to forget anyone.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.229
All right. All right.

09:20.240 --> 09:21.434
I said no.

09:22.800 --> 09:27.191
Jerry, I just want to let you know
Lyle and I are completely over.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.759
I'd rather be with you.

09:28.920 --> 09:33.516
Just me? No dudes or fellers?

09:33.680 --> 09:36.274
- What do you think?
- I can start right away.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.111
- But not here.
- I'm not here. Leave a message.

09:39.280 --> 09:40.713
Jerry, what's happening?

09:40.880 --> 09:43.758
Jerry, come on, pick up the phone.

09:45.560 --> 09:49.269
So I said to him,
"Arthur, Artie, bubele...

09:49.840 --> 09:52.752
...why does the salesman have to die?
Change the title.

09:52.920 --> 09:57.198
The Life of a Salesman.
That's what people want to see."

09:57.360 --> 09:58.873
Excuse me, Mr. Kramer.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.918
My name is Lewis Maxtone-Graham.

10:02.080 --> 10:05.152
I'm one of the producers
of Scarsdale Surprise.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.312
Oh, hey. Yeah. Lew!

10:08.480 --> 10:10.152
We need to talk.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.956
Elaine, what did you want
to talk to me about?

10:16.120 --> 10:18.554
This. My office.

10:18.720 --> 10:21.075
Sam trashed my office.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.038
Well, I see what's going on here.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.988
I am smack-dab in the middle
of a good old-fashioned catfight.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.197
Mr. Peterman, this is not a catfight.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.751
This is violent, psychotic behaviour,
directed at me...

10:35.920 --> 10:38.559
...all because I told her
to swing her arms.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.393
Do you mean:

10:42.560 --> 10:45.711
Yes, that's the one.
Good day, Elaine.

10:45.880 --> 10:49.555
Oh, no, please, Mr. Peterman.
She's crazy.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.438
Crazy for feeling

10:53.600 --> 10:58.833
So lonely

11:01.160 --> 11:03.594
I can't believe how much
we did this afternoon.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.876
I have a friend,
today would be his whole life.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.713
Now, what time are you
picking me up tonight?

11:08.880 --> 11:10.871
You got reservations at Sfuzzi,
didn't you?

11:11.040 --> 11:12.951
Oh, yeah, Sfuzzi. I gotta do that.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.350
- Should I wear the outfit I bought?
- Sure.

11:15.520 --> 11:19.195
- Which one?
- The one with the:

11:19.360 --> 11:21.112
If I'm gonna get my hair cut,
I better go.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.191
Call me when you get home.
I won't be there...

11:23.360 --> 11:24.793
...but leave a message
so I know.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.154
Okay. Okay.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.793
- Do you mind?
- No, I'll grab them, yeah.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.550
Hey. I've done that today.

11:35.680 --> 11:38.752
- What? Did you lose your remote?
- No, cable's out.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.309
- What's with you? You look dead.
- It's Lanette.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.159
I need, like, an assistant
or an intern or something.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.314
Relationship intern, huh?

11:49.400 --> 11:53.598
Hey, what if the two of us
teamed up?

11:53.760 --> 11:56.320
- Not?
- No, no.

11:56.480 --> 11:57.993
- No, because that's...
- No.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.230
Listen, we're always sitting here.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.913
I help you with your girl problems.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.230
You help with my girl problems.
Where do we end up?

12:04.400 --> 12:06.391
- Here.
- Exactly, because neither one of us...

12:06.560 --> 12:08.118
...can handle a woman
by ourselves.

12:08.280 --> 12:10.271
- I'm trying.
- I've tried.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.668
We don't have it.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.958
But maybe the two of us,
working together at full capacity...

12:16.120 --> 12:18.953
...could do the job
of one normal man.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.759
And each of us would only
have to be, like, a half-man.

12:23.440 --> 12:26.238
That sounds about right.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.152
We understand
how excited you are...

12:28.320 --> 12:30.356
...to have this very,
very prestigious award.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.432
But you didn't have anything to do
with the actual production.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.953
No.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.715
I'm afraid there is no way
we can allow you to keep this Tony.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.118
- What?
- Unless...

12:41.280 --> 12:43.430
- Anything.
- Are you familiar with our star...

12:43.600 --> 12:46.558
...Raquel Welch?
- She's fantastic.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.119
She's a train wreck.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.998
There's a big tap-dance number...

12:51.160 --> 12:53.276
...before Jean Harris leaves
The Madeira School...

12:53.440 --> 12:54.793
...to confront Dr. Tarnower.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.110
- It is a gut-wrenching scene.
- Yes.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.912
But Raquel Welch doesn't move
her arms when she tap dances.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.559
It's very distracting.

13:02.720 --> 13:06.235
There is a lot of this... in tap dancing.

13:06.400 --> 13:09.278
So you'd like me to teach her
how to dance?

13:09.440 --> 13:12.000
No, we want you to fire her.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.436
Why do they want you
to fire Raquel Welch?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.238
Because they're terrified of her.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.118
I heard they cut one of her lines.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.350
She climbed up a rope
on the side of the stage...

13:27.520 --> 13:30.159
...and started dropping lights
on people's heads.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.311
A story like that's gotta be true.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.273
She seems very nice.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.953
Jerry, you're not in show business.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.792
You don't know
what these people are like.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.918
- I'm in show business.
- Oh, come on.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.516
What am I gonna do?
She's gonna eat me alive.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.399
I got a tape of Fantastic Voyage,
if you think that'll help.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.549
I'll take it.

13:50.080 --> 13:55.154
Jerry, that crazy straight-arm woman
down at Peterman's trashed my office.

13:55.320 --> 13:58.949
And then listen to this.
This is the message she left me.

13:59.120 --> 14:02.715
Elaine, I am going to find you.

14:02.880 --> 14:06.111
If not in your office,
then in the X erox room...

14:06.320 --> 14:09.676
...or the small conference room
next to the kitchen, or the kitchen.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.638
I mean, she must have a blueprint
of the building or something.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.109
- Did you tell Peterman about this?
- Well, I tried.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.350
But he thought it was
some sort of a catfight.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.953
Catfight?

14:19.800 --> 14:21.950
Okay. Why? Why do guys do this?

14:22.160 --> 14:24.958
What is so appealing to men
about a catfight?

14:25.120 --> 14:26.633
Catfight.

14:30.320 --> 14:33.915
Because men think if women are
grabbing and clawing at each other...

14:34.080 --> 14:36.640
...there's a chance
they might somehow kiss.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.279
- You got the tickets?
- Yeah.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.556
Two for the 7: 15
of Lenore's Promise.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.312
What, are you wearing
a green sweater?

14:46.480 --> 14:47.674
- I like it.
- Lanette doesn't.

14:47.840 --> 14:49.478
Here's your blue one.
It's her favourite.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.358
- What?
- Just put it on.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.751
All right. Now, remember
she got her nails done today...

14:54.920 --> 14:56.990
...so remark on
how you like the colour.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.116
And if you need me, you beep me.
All right?

14:59.280 --> 15:00.918
Here, here. There you go.
There you go.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.672
All right.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.149
- Go get them. You're a tiger!
- Hey, George, one second.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.073
She's having a party Friday.
She wants me to do the invitations.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.549
A little notice would have helped.
How many people?

15:10.720 --> 15:13.757
Thirty-five.
And, George, on the invitations...

15:13.920 --> 15:15.478
Yeah, I know. Don't skimp. Go, go.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.632
Right on time. I like that.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.268
I like your nails.
That is a great colour.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.477
- Love the sweater.
- This old thing?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.831
Hi, I need some party invitations.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.309
Okay. Have you been in here before?

15:30.880 --> 15:34.111
About a year ago.
Wedding invitations.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.880
Right. How did that all work out?

15:37.720 --> 15:39.472
No complaints.

15:40.680 --> 15:45.834
Well, they're arranged according
to price, and as I recall...

15:46.000 --> 15:50.869
Actually, I'll take these nice,
glossy ones.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.078
You are a fraud, Dr. Tarnower.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.396
You haven't even been
to Scarsdale.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.630
- Miss Welch. Hi.
- Who are you?

16:01.400 --> 16:03.197
Well, I'm Cosmo Kramer.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.351
I'm one of the producers.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.070
Hello. Sidney.

16:10.600 --> 16:14.275
No. No, I told you
I don't want to do that.

16:14.440 --> 16:18.399
If you bring it up again,
I'll feed your genitals to a wolf.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.353
Kids.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.270
- You're still here?
- Well, Miss Welch...

16:23.440 --> 16:28.309
...I do need to talk to you about a little
problem regarding your performance.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.351
- What kind of problem?
- Well, it seems that...

16:31.520 --> 16:35.035
...due to the vagaries
of the production parameters...

16:35.200 --> 16:39.352
...vis-á-vis the fragmenting of
the audience, due to cable television...

16:39.520 --> 16:41.988
...carnivals, water parks...
- Out with it.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.594
You're fired. You don't use your arms
when you tap dance.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.398
You're like a gorilla. I gotta go.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.912
A little help?

16:55.080 --> 16:56.399
- Hey, Frolf?
- Yeah.

16:56.560 --> 16:59.518
You know, we need a fourth
for the back nine. You want in?

17:02.560 --> 17:05.199
What's the deal
with airplane peanuts?

17:06.160 --> 17:08.469
- Yeah, sure.
- Come on.

17:10.119 --> 17:11.598
Well, I'm ready.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.715
Let's towel it up.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.720
Jerry, where are those invitations
you were supposed to get?

17:16.880 --> 17:19.189
If they don't go out today,
they're useless.

17:19.359 --> 17:20.873
But we're in towels.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.679
- Jerry.
- All right, one second.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.356
He Frolfs... he scores!

17:34.120 --> 17:36.475
- Hello.
- George, where are those invitations?

17:36.640 --> 17:38.870
You were supposed to leave them
with her doorman.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.759
- Did you shave your chest hair?
- No.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.353
Did you at least pick them up?

17:46.520 --> 17:48.875
Yeah, yeah, super glossy,
the best they had.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.473
Well, get them over here pronto.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.914
We're at towels here, George.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.355
All right. All right.
Keep your towel on.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.390
- What?
- It's a joke.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.279
All right. That's not bad.
Now get over here.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.676
- if not in your apartment,
then in the laundry room...

18:11.840 --> 18:15.037
...or the ATM in the building
across the street...

18:15.200 --> 18:17.270
...or the watch shop!

18:17.440 --> 18:20.637
Can't you do anything about this?
I mean, this woman is a psycho.

18:23.040 --> 18:26.828
Look, just because I'm a woman
doesn't mean...

18:28.480 --> 18:30.835
I don't move my arms when I dance?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.558
That's my signature.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.271
Would you just keep an eye out
for this woman?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.317
She's about, I don't know,
yay high...

18:37.480 --> 18:41.519
...and she doesn't swing her arms
when she walks.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.478
- What do you mean?
- Like this:

18:47.200 --> 18:50.636
What the hell is that?
Are you making fun of my dancing?

18:51.520 --> 18:53.078
Aren't you Raquel Welch?

18:53.240 --> 18:56.277
You know who I am.
Now, what are you doing?

18:56.440 --> 18:59.830
Nothing. I just wasn't
moving my arms.

19:00.480 --> 19:02.994
That's it. You're going down.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.756
Catfight.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.635
So how's George?

19:10.800 --> 19:12.870
I don't know.
They won't tell me anything.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.314
What's that?

19:16.160 --> 19:17.991
Tony.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.509
- What happened to you?
- Raquel Welch.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.478
- What happened to you?
- Raquel Welch.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.791
- The woman is a menace.
- Yeah.

19:30.960 --> 19:34.396
I bumped into her on the street.
It got pretty ugly.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.592
A catfight with Raquel Welch.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.475
My God, George.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.155
I slipped on the invitations.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.829
- How's the towels?
- They're back on the rack.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.072
- Even with the two of us?
- I think we're still a man short.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.670
Mr. Costanza...

20:01.400 --> 20:04.312
...your legs have sustained
extensive trauma.

20:04.920 --> 20:09.118
Apparently, your body was in
a state of advanced atrophy...

20:09.280 --> 20:12.238
...due to a period
of extreme inactivity.

20:13.080 --> 20:16.311
But with a lot of hard work
and a little bit of luck...

20:16.480 --> 20:21.600
...I think there's a good chance
you may, one day, walk again.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.832
Well, that's good news.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.277
Wow, invitations again.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.000
Yeah, that's weird.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.389
All right. Well...

20:41.200 --> 20:43.509
- You want to grab some coffee?
- Yeah, coffee.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.671
- I'd like to get some coffee.
- Okay.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.111
This was supposed to be
the Summer of George.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.875
The Summer of George.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.038
Summer of George.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.553
- Swing them.
- Swing them.

21:15.720 --> 21:18.234
- Right? Okay?
- Sort of swing.

21:22.960 --> 21:25.235
Swing them.

21:26.760 --> 21:27.954
Just swing them.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.954
I can't do it. Okay? It's hard.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.636
- Come on. Okay?
- Here we go.

21:34.800 --> 21:38.395
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

21:40.560 --> 21:42.869
There's still a little summer left.
