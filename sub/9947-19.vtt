00:01.700 --> 00:02.680
Anyone watching,

00:02.681 --> 00:06.359
thinking we know fuck all
about knowing fuck all about owt,

00:06.360 --> 00:08.559
needs to watch their backs!

00:08.560 --> 00:11.729
So, you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.730 --> 00:13.459
sending prices sky-high.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.640
Literally,
literally taking the grass

00:15.641 --> 00:17.849
from its own roots.

00:17.850 --> 00:20.059
Now, you've got your Con-Dem Nation.

00:20.060 --> 00:23.729
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up.

00:23.730 --> 00:27.399
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?!

00:27.400 --> 00:31.319
Is revolution a word
or was it never?

00:31.320 --> 00:33.759
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:33.760 --> 00:37.169
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:37.170 --> 00:40.599
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester,

00:40.600 --> 00:43.289
and they charge us for water!

00:43.290 --> 00:48.189
I wandered lonely as a clown
Necking mushrooms rarely found

00:48.190 --> 00:51.859
This green and pleasant land
In ancient times.

00:51.860 --> 00:54.310
Yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!

00:54.311 --> 00:57.739
It's not theirs any more!

00:57.740 --> 01:00.189
This is our England, now!

01:00.190 --> 01:02.370
Part-ay!

'Yeah, it's all right, round here.
Apart from the smackheads.

01:15.360 --> 01:18.039
'And the alkies. And the dealers.'

01:18.040 --> 01:20.249
That's my bike!

01:20.250 --> 01:22.939
'Murderers, rapists,
racists, mentalists,

toothless chain-smoking shit mongers.

'Apart from that, it's nice.

'But if home's what you make it,
try as I might,

'it's not home.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.379
'Not my home.

01:36.380 --> 01:38.590
'Thank fuck!'

01:41.540 --> 01:44.470
That's for calling me a tramp
on Facebook, you hairy slag!

01:46.920 --> 01:51.309
What the fuck?! You little bastard!

02:00.860 --> 02:03.549
Why is there a foreign bloke
upstairs in the cupboard?

02:03.550 --> 02:05.519
Sorting the water heater.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.480
What, Housing?

02:07.700 --> 02:09.669
Fucking joking, aren't you?

02:09.669 --> 02:12.120
We'll wait till Dick docks before they
pull their finger out their arse.

02:12.121 --> 02:13.579
What, you paid someone?

02:13.580 --> 02:14.558
Ha! Has he shite!

02:15.791 --> 02:17.249
He's doing it for free?

02:17.250 --> 02:19.459
I'll answer that, shall I?

02:19.460 --> 02:20.920
No, food. He's homeless.

02:22.630 --> 02:26.059
Well, don't blame me.
He'd have done it for a blow job!

02:26.060 --> 02:29.490
Selfish cow in there refused.
You want hot water, don't you?

02:31.200 --> 02:33.159
OK, done?

02:33.160 --> 02:35.610
Yeah? You fix? Very good.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.200
Aidan's gone and got himself
arrested.

02:45.380 --> 02:47.590
One of you'll have to go
to the police station.

02:50.280 --> 02:54.189
I've got my wheelchair dance
formation class!

02:54.190 --> 02:55.650
God!

02:57.620 --> 03:00.549
My God!

03:00.550 --> 03:02.759
Mimi Maguire!

03:02.760 --> 03:04.719
All right, Evie, love.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.169
I didn't recognise you!

03:07.170 --> 03:08.640
You look fab!

03:08.641 --> 03:10.339
Ta, hon.

03:10.340 --> 03:11.798
I've tried so many diets.

03:11.799 --> 03:13.270
Protein, cabbage,

03:13.271 --> 03:15.479
baby food.

03:15.480 --> 03:19.389
How do you get from the size
of a bus to the size of a bus stop?

03:19.390 --> 03:20.608
The shake diet.

03:20.609 --> 03:21.360
What's that?

03:21.361 --> 03:24.519
Every time you're offered food,
shake your head, you fat twat!

03:24.520 --> 03:25.750
Now, do one!

03:29.420 --> 03:33.329
Cilla! Cilla!

03:33.330 --> 03:35.060
Cilla!

03:36.040 --> 03:37.749
Cilla!

03:37.750 --> 03:38.969
Cilla!

03:55.120 --> 03:56.590
Stop.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.709
Man of the match again.

04:06.620 --> 04:07.340
How old?

04:07.341 --> 04:09.549
14.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.279
I'm 15 next year.

04:11.280 --> 04:11.998
What is it you want?

04:11.999 --> 04:13.218
Just you.

04:13.219 --> 04:14.440
I told you to disappear.

04:14.441 --> 04:15.910
No!

04:17.640 --> 04:19.579
I see you again, I'll kill you.

04:21.790 --> 04:24.239
I've just remembered,
she's with her brother.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.919
My head's up my arse.
I must be going through the change.

04:26.920 --> 04:28.890
Tell the police it's a false alarm.

04:51.880 --> 04:54.569
Billy? I know it's you.

04:54.570 --> 04:56.539
Where are you?

04:56.540 --> 04:59.229
If you hurt her,
I'll kill you, you bastard!

05:12.930 --> 05:15.859
If you think I'll be dragged
through the courts cos of you,

05:15.860 --> 05:17.080
think again!

05:17.081 --> 05:20.009
Theft and criminal damage.

05:20.010 --> 05:23.679
Police can't touch me.
I'm a minor. Got the law on my side.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.649
Ooh, fuck it!

05:25.650 --> 05:29.319
It'll be us that'll get stung with
a hefty fine for his shenanigans.

05:29.320 --> 05:32.009
I am not getting out of pocket
to protect your arse.

05:32.010 --> 05:33.719
You better buck your ideas up,

05:33.720 --> 05:35.420
or you can fuck off
back to your own family!

05:35.421 --> 05:36.909
Lay off him!

05:36.910 --> 05:40.079
Mate, things are
tough enough as it is,

05:40.080 --> 05:42.519
but don't shit on your own doorstep.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.449
I'll be gone by the time it gets
to court. Mum's out tomorrow.

05:45.450 --> 05:46.440
Aidan!

05:48.880 --> 05:51.809
Macho Health magazine says
this is the best proven way

05:51.810 --> 05:53.300
for males to bond.

05:53.301 --> 05:55.239
It'll help us open up,

05:55.240 --> 05:56.470
build a trust.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.109
Friends that bruise together,
stay together.

06:08.950 --> 06:12.619
Get off, you little wanker!
Fuck off! It's weird.

06:12.620 --> 06:15.309
I'm trying to improve our situation.

06:15.310 --> 06:18.000
Can't we just carry on
getting pissed instead?

06:19.720 --> 06:22.170
You've been a closed book
since I moved in.

06:22.171 --> 06:24.859
I was hoping to get you to open up,

06:24.860 --> 06:27.550
talk about your feelings and shit,
so we'd have a better...

06:28.770 --> 06:30.000
connection.

06:30.001 --> 06:31.459
Like what?

06:31.460 --> 06:32.920
Your kids.

06:34.890 --> 06:37.819
If you're so bothered
about losing your visiting rights,

06:37.820 --> 06:40.750
then why aren't
you fighting for them?

06:45.160 --> 06:46.390
Fuck you, then.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.510
Sad.

06:54.450 --> 06:55.680
I feel sad.

06:58.870 --> 07:00.569
I miss my kids.

07:00.570 --> 07:04.239
I won't ever see them again.
Sue won't let me.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.929
Said I have to match
her standards of a home

07:06.930 --> 07:09.379
before she'd let them visit.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.080
Best I can do is this place.

07:12.310 --> 07:14.280
I'm a bad daddy. A failure.

07:19.410 --> 07:20.878
You can't give up.

07:20.879 --> 07:22.100
Dads...

07:25.050 --> 07:26.520
are important.

07:31.890 --> 07:34.339
Look, kids need the father's love.

07:34.340 --> 07:36.280
It's obvious you need theirs.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.630
Let me help.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.470
Aidan's left this in his room.

08:03.930 --> 08:06.140
"Smell you laters".

08:08.350 --> 08:09.808
It means he's fucked off.

08:09.809 --> 08:11.520
We both know where he's going.

08:11.521 --> 08:13.480
It's out of our hands now.

08:20.830 --> 08:24.499
18 months and this is how
he shows his gratitude?

08:24.500 --> 08:26.950
Not even so much
as a "Thank you, Auntie",

08:26.951 --> 08:28.889
or even a "Goodbye".

08:28.890 --> 08:30.860
He wants his mum.
You can't blame him.

08:30.861 --> 08:33.308
I blame his mother.

08:33.309 --> 08:36.239
The degree of violence that
put her in prison worries me.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.919
What if next time it's not a punter?
What if it's Aidan?

08:38.919 --> 08:40.389
You're overreacting.

08:40.390 --> 08:43.337
From what I know, the gypsy father
left to marry one of his own kind

08:43.339 --> 08:45.040
before Aidan was out of nappies.

08:45.041 --> 08:47.969
After that, his mother
changed for the worst.

08:47.970 --> 08:50.419
Drugs and prostitution.

08:50.420 --> 08:53.609
Aidan was dragged up,
passed from pillar to post.

08:53.610 --> 08:56.058
Had to fend for himself
since he could walk.

08:56.059 --> 08:58.000
Right, if that's true,
why would he want to go back to that?

08:58.001 --> 09:01.440
Doesn't know any better, I suppose.

09:23.950 --> 09:25.410
'I'm ready for you now. Meet me.'

09:53.800 --> 09:55.269
Aidan!

09:55.270 --> 09:56.730
Aidan! Aidan!

10:01.870 --> 10:03.090
She's already out.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.780
Sorry, mate.

10:19.170 --> 10:21.379
Where is she? Where's Mum?

10:21.380 --> 10:23.079
What?

10:23.080 --> 10:26.279
Tell me, you old bitch! You know.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.499
Talk sense.

10:27.500 --> 10:28.720
Evil cow!

10:28.721 --> 10:31.650
Shitebag. Show some respect
for the dead!

10:40.220 --> 10:42.668
People at the prison said
she's been out for two months.

10:42.669 --> 10:43.888
And I'm to blame because?

10:43.889 --> 10:44.610
What? You didn't know?

10:44.611 --> 10:47.319
Course not!

10:47.320 --> 10:49.749
What about Aidan?

10:49.750 --> 10:53.679
Until his mother turns up,
if at all, we put up with him.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.869
Whoa... Hang on.

10:55.870 --> 10:59.060
Do we keep collecting his readies?

11:01.510 --> 11:03.450
It's like old times, Carl, innit?

11:07.360 --> 11:09.569
You all right?

11:09.570 --> 11:11.779
Mum will come for me.

11:11.780 --> 11:15.449
Probably waiting to get back
on her feet and settled. Isn't she?

11:15.450 --> 11:19.839
Mate, Patty cares. She was searching
the streets for you till 3am.

11:19.840 --> 11:22.289
She doesn't.
She wants to keep me as a slave.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.499
It isn't her fault. Ride it out.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.948
Till you know what's happened,
you're stuck here.

11:26.949 --> 11:28.648
And you've got a court
date coming up.

11:28.649 --> 11:30.860
Dad won't want you going down. We
need the money you're bringing in.

11:30.861 --> 11:33.310
What money?

11:35.280 --> 11:37.459
Your benefits.

11:37.460 --> 11:41.640
You've got the advantage, so make
the most of the situation, yeah?

11:51.910 --> 11:53.610
Let me explain.

11:53.611 --> 11:57.039
I get it. Me and you've
got unresolved shit to sort

11:57.040 --> 11:59.488
but that doesn't give you
the right to take my baby.

11:59.489 --> 12:00.720
Our baby.

12:01.940 --> 12:05.369
I'd never do anything
to hurt her. Hurt you.

12:05.370 --> 12:08.779
I had to get your attention, get
you somewhere where you'd listen.

12:08.780 --> 12:11.730
And I badly wanted
to see my daughter.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.829
OK, whatever it is you want, Billy,
I'll do anything, I promise.

12:17.830 --> 12:21.020
Just let me hold my baby, please?

12:22.720 --> 12:24.210
And you'll listen?

12:24.211 --> 12:26.160
Please?

12:41.320 --> 12:46.219
Don't you ever, ever, ever take
my baby away from me, d'you hear me?

12:46.220 --> 12:50.130
There was no need for this fucking
palaver. I'm a reasonable woman!

13:01.151 --> 13:03.360
What do you think you're doing?

13:05.060 --> 13:06.759
Frank, stop this!

13:06.760 --> 13:08.250
Yeah!

13:10.680 --> 13:12.159
Everyone, feck off!

13:12.160 --> 13:13.118
No. Get lost for a couple of hours.

13:13.119 --> 13:14.110
Piss off.

13:14.111 --> 13:16.559
I'll get on to social services.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.990
Find a foster family.
And it'll be bye-bye, benefits.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.660
Up to you. I will do it!

13:28.560 --> 13:30.020
Come.

13:48.620 --> 13:52.529
I can understand you don't want
the cripple cramping your style.

13:52.530 --> 13:53.490
But come on. At least...

13:59.610 --> 14:05.009
I couldn't live with what I'd done.
What you did to get rid of me.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.480
So this is your revenge, is it?

14:06.481 --> 14:11.609
No! I just wanted to see for myself.
That's all. See you.

14:11.610 --> 14:15.279
But then I saw her.
So I left school.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.209
Got a job, and saved up
for this place.

14:18.210 --> 14:21.640
You needn't have bothered.
Everything's perfect as it is.

14:24.810 --> 14:26.540
Can you get off me now, please?

14:28.480 --> 14:31.920
Lucky for you
my piles are giving me jip.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.829
So what now?

14:35.830 --> 14:37.289
I can't think straight.

14:37.290 --> 14:38.520
You're still in shock.

14:38.521 --> 14:41.200
I know it's my fault
but you can't leave like this.

14:42.430 --> 14:44.879
Argh!

14:44.880 --> 14:48.549
Next door's empty. So once I've
knocked this through and decorated,

14:48.550 --> 14:50.280
this place will be like a palace.

14:50.281 --> 14:52.719
You doing this
is giving him false hope.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.680
How?

14:53.681 --> 14:58.099
You think Sue's gonna drop
everything and fly over here?

14:58.100 --> 15:00.548
Sue agreed!
She's coming over with the kids!

15:00.549 --> 15:02.010
Told you.

15:02.011 --> 15:05.179
We'll never get it done in time.
Not the way Sue'd want.

15:05.180 --> 15:06.670
If me and you work together,
we will.

15:06.671 --> 15:08.369
I'll help with the decorating.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.510
Look, I'm not being funny,
but this is man's work.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.920
Shane mind you helping?
You don't have to...

15:17.921 --> 15:20.109
It's fine. Shane's fine.

15:20.110 --> 15:21.840
I want to help.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.120
I'll leave you men to it.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.140
Hammer time!

16:13.940 --> 16:15.400
Got you an en suite.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.350
Oohh...

16:31.560 --> 16:32.540
Wake up.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.990
That's mine! Get off.

16:34.991 --> 16:38.899
Move, get out the house now.
Everyone, out, now. Get out! Move!

16:38.900 --> 16:42.069
Oi, get the fuck out, go on, move.

16:42.070 --> 16:44.780
Up, now. Get out, now.

17:18.790 --> 17:19.750
Where've you been?

17:19.751 --> 17:21.959
Celebrating my Polish friend's
new job.

17:21.960 --> 17:26.848
No, no, no, Hun-gar-y.

17:26.849 --> 17:31.269
Yeah, me too. Packet of
turkey flavoured crisps do you?

17:31.270 --> 17:33.689
And Aidan's demise.
Money isn't worth it.

17:33.690 --> 17:35.419
What? Why?

17:35.420 --> 17:37.629
I was thrown out my own house!

17:37.630 --> 17:40.080
A man my age shouldn't
have to put up with that.

17:40.081 --> 17:42.019
I should be living in comfort.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.230
Men of your age
are usually out working.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.659
I've had more jobs than Mr Benn.
I am not work shy.

17:47.660 --> 17:50.589
It's my back, you see.

17:50.590 --> 17:52.798
I know you're not,
you're fucking allergic.

17:52.799 --> 17:54.740
This is just a blip.
I'll sort Aidan.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.949
You've done enough damage.
For his own sake,

17:56.950 --> 17:58.920
he needs to be reminded
who's in charge.

17:58.921 --> 18:01.599
He's due in court tomorrow.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.549
His solicitor says it's up to me

18:03.550 --> 18:06.499
whether he's packed off
to a young offenders or not.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.200
Best place for him.

18:09.430 --> 18:10.650
You can't.

18:10.651 --> 18:13.099
Nothing gets past you, does it?

18:13.100 --> 18:15.549
The way you treated the house.
Me and Frank.

18:15.550 --> 18:18.479
After everything I've done for you?
Is that fair?

18:18.480 --> 18:19.460
Patty?

18:19.461 --> 18:21.159
I could get you off.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.609
I could persuade Frank,
to keep you at home

18:23.610 --> 18:28.510
if you promise your days
of taking the piss are over.

18:41.730 --> 18:43.679
Room for a little one?

18:43.680 --> 18:46.599
Time you've finished,
water'll be cold.

18:46.600 --> 18:49.050
It took me an hour and
80 kettles to fill up this.

18:50.540 --> 18:53.949
What's the matter? You're the one
who said we should bond, get closer.

18:53.950 --> 18:56.899
There are certain boundaries
you just don't cross.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.840
What's the matter? I'm not gay.

19:05.950 --> 19:08.399
Plum fiddler! Cock jockey!

19:08.400 --> 19:09.858
Arse bandit! Bollock ninja!

19:09.859 --> 19:10.840
Brother fucker!

19:10.841 --> 19:13.529
This is exactly why
I didn't say anything.

19:13.530 --> 19:16.960
I am capable of being mates with
a man without being pervy, you know.

19:18.670 --> 19:22.099
I see you as a mate, nothing more,
so don't flatter yourself.

19:22.100 --> 19:25.030
You're not even my type anyway.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.230
So...

19:51.450 --> 19:53.160
Who is your type?

19:56.590 --> 19:57.570
Go on?

19:59.040 --> 20:00.020
Well...

20:01.960 --> 20:03.930
Just someone nice and loving.

20:03.931 --> 20:08.080
Who I can tell anything to
and just know it'd be safe with him.

20:10.530 --> 20:12.500
Someone who's easy to talk to,

20:12.501 --> 20:15.190
and will always be there for me
no matter what.

20:16.650 --> 20:20.319
When I'm sad, he'd comfort me and
tell me everything will be OK.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.040
Big dick!

20:21.041 --> 20:23.250
Yeah!

20:25.460 --> 20:26.680
What about you?

20:30.120 --> 20:32.060
There is someone.

20:34.270 --> 20:37.700
Trust her with my life.
She's perfect.

20:41.110 --> 20:45.520
I'd be with her now
but... it's difficult.

20:50.180 --> 20:52.359
I know who it is!

20:52.360 --> 20:54.569
Well, it's Sue, innit?

20:54.570 --> 20:59.229
You don't just want your kids back,
you want her back too.

20:59.230 --> 21:01.680
You want to be a family again.

21:27.600 --> 21:29.560
You snore like a jumbo jet.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.939
If you're hungry,
there's cereal or toast.

21:34.940 --> 21:36.910
I like a full English.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.059
In the grill. Kept it warm for you.

21:41.060 --> 21:42.759
Smart arse.

21:49.630 --> 21:52.559
I can't deny Cilla her dad.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.520
What kind of mother
would that make me?

21:55.990 --> 21:57.930
I want to tell me kids.

21:59.160 --> 22:02.109
I don't want to be "a" dad.
I'm her dad.

22:02.110 --> 22:04.560
I want to be in Cilla's life
for the rest of mine. And...

22:04.561 --> 22:06.999
Don't be getting ahead of yourself.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.900
Things need to be sorted between
me and my family first. Understand?

22:20.950 --> 22:25.099
Cheese and tomato pizza?

22:25.100 --> 22:27.549
Cheese and tomato garlic bread.

22:27.550 --> 22:29.759
I got you a meat feast.
But she is vegetarian.

22:29.760 --> 22:30.738
Yeah...

22:30.739 --> 22:31.960
Fuck have you been?

22:31.961 --> 22:35.129
Where d'you think? With that
snidey twitching twat, Marty.

22:35.130 --> 22:36.118
He's all right.

22:36.119 --> 22:36.838
He's scum.

22:36.839 --> 22:37.820
You're scum.

22:37.821 --> 22:39.039
Shane.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.489
All of you, fucking drop it!

22:41.490 --> 22:43.699
Got something to tell you.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.910
It's about...

22:48.840 --> 22:50.300
It's about...

22:52.000 --> 22:53.729
It's about...

22:53.730 --> 22:56.899
You going to keep us in suspenders
or what, Mam?

22:56.900 --> 22:59.109
It's about Cilla's dad.

22:59.110 --> 23:00.809
We know. Billy Tutton.

23:00.810 --> 23:02.299
Fucking what?

23:02.300 --> 23:03.999
I only told Shane!

23:04.000 --> 23:05.470
Nobody told me!

23:05.471 --> 23:08.899
I've been worried sick keeping it
a secret because I was ashamed.

23:08.900 --> 23:11.349
Mimi, you shagged a 14 year old?

23:11.350 --> 23:12.810
Did she, fuck. Mam's not a paedo.

23:12.811 --> 23:15.499
How is Cilla Billy's
if they didn't shag, dickhead?

23:15.500 --> 23:18.929
Well, got his...

23:18.930 --> 23:20.158
Well, she opened...

23:20.159 --> 23:22.360
Mum, tell her you're not a paedo!
Are you?

23:23.830 --> 23:26.009
I didn't know how old he was.
I gave him wanks.

23:26.010 --> 23:28.220
And sometimes I'd...

23:29.440 --> 23:32.399
I'd lie in bed and flick me bean
while he stood over tugging off.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.860
Argh. No!

23:33.861 --> 23:36.549
One time he got too close
and there was a spillage.

23:36.550 --> 23:39.480
At the time, Billy warned I could
get pregnant. I never thought I...

23:43.150 --> 23:47.559
See. It was a jizz finger,
that's all.

23:47.560 --> 23:52.440
Mam, you've done nothing
to be ashamed of. And we love you.

23:57.330 --> 23:59.779
He's back. He wants access to Cilla.

23:59.780 --> 24:01.748
No way! I'll tear
his fucking bollocks off!

24:01.749 --> 24:03.688
I'll carve him a new arsehole!

24:03.689 --> 24:05.180
I'll murder the fucking cunt!

24:08.350 --> 24:11.779
Electronic tag and a 6pm curfew.

24:11.780 --> 24:15.209
How's that punishment?
Human rights gone mad!

24:15.210 --> 24:18.620
Oi! What's he doing in my room?

24:20.350 --> 24:23.279
That's our contingency.
We rented it out.

24:23.280 --> 24:27.189
Your mother could turn up any day.
We have to cover our backs.

24:27.190 --> 24:29.879
Until then, you won't be taking
the proverbial any more.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.100
If you don't like it,

24:31.101 --> 24:35.009
you're welcome to give your mates
at social services a call.

24:35.010 --> 24:38.919
You'll get used to sharing.
He works nights, security.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.129
So he'll sleep all day.

24:41.130 --> 24:43.099
You won't even know he's there.

24:43.100 --> 24:47.249
And I'm obliged to let you know
he's on the sex offenders register.

24:47.250 --> 24:50.439
Some lost in translation thing.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.150
It's a stupid law anyway.

25:11.030 --> 25:12.489
You have to leave, now.

25:12.490 --> 25:14.699
The news about you
didn't go down well.

25:14.700 --> 25:15.918
They want your blood
and I can't protect you.

25:15.919 --> 25:17.888
I didn't come back, do all this,

25:17.889 --> 25:18.848
to just run away.

25:18.849 --> 25:19.840
Are you daft?

25:19.841 --> 25:23.029
You can't just show up and act
like everything's normal.

25:23.030 --> 25:24.729
It's not. It's fucked up!

25:24.730 --> 25:27.179
I'm older, I'm not a kid any more.
I'm 16.

25:27.180 --> 25:30.369
If you give me a chance,
we can make it work.

25:30.370 --> 25:33.539
I have to know I'm doing
the right thing by Cilla

25:33.540 --> 25:36.469
and without my lads on side,
you can't be in her life.

25:36.470 --> 25:42.349
You need to prove to me and them
that you're ready to be her father.

25:42.350 --> 25:44.319
And if you can't, I understand,

25:44.320 --> 25:46.500
but it's that or nothing.

25:49.210 --> 25:53.839
"The three billy goats gruff
had to cross a river.

25:53.840 --> 25:57.039
"There was only one bridge across it

25:57.040 --> 25:59.479
"and under the bridge
lived a nasty troll.

25:59.480 --> 26:04.380
"The smallest billy goat gruff
was the first to get to the bridge...

26:10.980 --> 26:14.889
"The next billy goat gruff
crossed the bridge.

26:14.890 --> 26:19.789
"Clip-clop, clip-clop. 'Who's
that clip-clopping over my bridge?',

26:19.790 --> 26:22.000
"shouted the troll...

26:24.180 --> 26:28.600
"The third billy goat gruff
approached the bridge..."

26:30.800 --> 26:32.510
You're shaking all over.

26:34.210 --> 26:36.419
That's not my fucking problem!

26:36.420 --> 26:40.569
Just do what you're fucking told
or I'll rip you in fucking two!

26:40.570 --> 26:44.239
I know it's what you wanted,
but I can't do it.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.209
I'm not meeting Jamie.

26:46.210 --> 26:47.440
It'd be suicide.

26:49.880 --> 26:53.289
For Cilla, I can't be reckless
with my life.

26:53.290 --> 26:55.500
Please don't take her away from me.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.378
What the fuck?!

27:01.379 --> 27:02.600
I love ya.

27:04.550 --> 27:09.679
I've been up the wall trying to get
a grip of how to make this work

27:09.680 --> 27:12.399
and you've been lying to me?
You don't want Cilla!

27:12.400 --> 27:13.360
You want to get into
me knickers again!

27:13.361 --> 27:15.799
I do want Cilla... and I want you.

27:15.800 --> 27:16.550
You can't have us both.

27:16.551 --> 27:19.239
Why not? You love me. I know it.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.220
We can be a family.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.909
I don't love you, Billy,

27:22.910 --> 27:26.340
and if you can't accept that,
the deal's off.

27:35.870 --> 27:38.079
Have you finished with
Lillian's tool box?

27:38.080 --> 27:40.280
Cos I've got a few
decorating ideas...

27:40.281 --> 27:42.730
Fuck me! Where did you...?

27:44.200 --> 27:45.660
Oi! You bastard!

27:52.260 --> 27:55.210
Well, couldn't wait for you.
Sue's flying over tomorrow.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.140
Do you like it?

27:58.141 --> 27:59.839
I love it!

27:59.840 --> 28:01.069
If...

28:01.070 --> 28:04.739
If you was a high-maintenance
kinda girl,

28:04.740 --> 28:07.189
would this sort of place
give you a wide-on?

28:07.190 --> 28:08.170
I beg your pardon?

28:08.171 --> 28:10.860
Well, Marty's trying to get back
with Sue so any ideas?

28:12.080 --> 28:13.550
Didn't realise.

28:13.551 --> 28:17.719
Mainly for the kids.
I mean, one step at a time.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.149
How we supposed to put
a shelf up with that?

28:20.150 --> 28:21.640
I best get off.

28:21.641 --> 28:24.319
I'm helping Shane with Mimi's party.

28:24.320 --> 28:27.489
I'm really excited for you, Marty,
I hope it works out.

28:27.490 --> 28:29.939
Come tomorrow and meet my kids.

28:29.940 --> 28:30.920
I don't want to be in the way.

28:30.921 --> 28:32.630
You won't.

28:46.570 --> 28:49.759
An old work mate heard where Mum is.
Gave me the address.

28:49.760 --> 28:52.959
S'cuse me, have you seen her?
She's my mum.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.659
She's got blacky brown hair.

28:54.660 --> 28:55.880
About this big.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.999
Ta for keeping hold of my tag.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.469
I tried it on but...

29:03.470 --> 29:05.409
I can't get it off.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.620
Soak your ankle in warm water.

29:21.560 --> 29:26.699
Either tell me now, or three glasses
later when the truth juice kicks in.

29:26.700 --> 29:28.909
I'm fine.

29:28.910 --> 29:31.599
I was going to give Billy a chance,
only he tried it on,

29:31.600 --> 29:33.560
said he loved me, so I called it off.

29:33.561 --> 29:36.730
That because you don't love him
back, or because you do?

29:37.960 --> 29:39.679
Neither.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.870
Can't do right for doing wrong?

29:43.600 --> 29:44.580
Me, too.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.969
He's not ready anyway, he's 16.

29:48.970 --> 29:53.870
Truthfully, when is anyone
ready to be a parent?

29:56.320 --> 29:59.989
Doesn't matter, my lads have made
it clear they'll never accept it.

29:59.990 --> 30:01.690
This is the best thing for everyone.

30:01.691 --> 30:03.419
Except Cilla.

30:03.420 --> 30:06.349
You're going to have tell her
why you rejected her dad.

30:06.350 --> 30:08.559
Because he said he loved you?!

30:08.560 --> 30:10.019
Want some advice?

30:10.020 --> 30:12.469
Grow a clit, for fuck's sake,

30:12.470 --> 30:14.920
and stop hiding behind your boys
and making excuses!

30:14.921 --> 30:17.359
Take control before you regret it.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.550
Don't talk to me like that!

30:21.280 --> 30:22.979
You're right though.

30:22.980 --> 30:26.169
She'll find out when she's old
enough, then she'll hate me.

30:26.170 --> 30:27.880
Thanks

30:29.100 --> 30:29.840
Pleasure

30:33.760 --> 30:35.939
Do him, son, do him, do him!

30:35.940 --> 30:37.670
Yes! Kicked your arse again!

30:37.671 --> 30:39.609
That's the third time.

30:39.610 --> 30:41.580
Do you want another round?

30:44.030 --> 30:45.730
I know where Mum is.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.400
I might not agree with Patty, but
she's better at this stuff than me.

30:49.401 --> 30:51.369
Don't tell her.

30:51.370 --> 30:54.779
Listen, when people like
your mum disappear

30:54.780 --> 30:56.000
it's because they don't
want to be found.

30:56.001 --> 30:57.729
Thought you'd be on my side?

30:57.730 --> 31:01.139
I am! Look, I've been through it.

31:01.140 --> 31:04.570
I were just like you at your
age, 'cept... better looking!

31:06.040 --> 31:08.479
Hey, from one mate to another,

31:08.480 --> 31:09.710
just be careful.

31:16.070 --> 31:17.290
Made a stew for everyone.

31:17.291 --> 31:19.020
Grand.

31:22.690 --> 31:26.100
What did you do, piss in it?

31:29.290 --> 31:30.518
Lovely

31:30.519 --> 31:32.958
If I promise to be good,
will you get rid of Poley?

31:32.959 --> 31:34.908
And lose an extra 50 notes a week?

31:34.909 --> 31:36.128
Fucked if I'm going to let that go!

31:36.129 --> 31:37.358
Leave off, Frank.

31:37.359 --> 31:39.318
He's making an effort,
we should embrace it.

31:39.319 --> 31:41.770
Actually, I've suddenly
acquired a hunger.

31:41.771 --> 31:43.239
I made it for tea.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.220
Fancy any, Patty?

31:45.440 --> 31:47.388
You're offering an olive branch.

31:47.389 --> 31:49.840
Do you want me to accept
or snap it in two?

31:53.271 --> 31:55.480
All right, kiddo?

31:56.700 --> 31:58.400
Come on, come on in, take a seat

31:58.401 --> 32:03.060
and I shall serve you some
of Aidan's lovely stew.

32:13.090 --> 32:14.320
Tastes like arsehole!

32:15.540 --> 32:17.239
Salt!

32:17.240 --> 32:18.470
Mm.

32:24.590 --> 32:28.499
This'll be Patty and Frank at Mimi's
party when the stew kicks.

32:32.170 --> 32:33.879
You will come back and visit?

32:33.880 --> 32:34.860
'Course.

32:55.160 --> 32:56.629
Poley?!

32:56.630 --> 32:58.840
You were only supposed
to shit yourself!

33:09.610 --> 33:11.319
Carl!

33:11.320 --> 33:13.259
Wake up. Help!

33:13.260 --> 33:15.230
Wake up! Help!

33:17.440 --> 33:20.119
Help! Someone help! Help!

33:20.120 --> 33:21.590
Help!

33:23.050 --> 33:24.519
Get your mum!

33:24.520 --> 33:25.999
My baby!

33:26.000 --> 33:26.960
Your mum, she'll know what to do!

33:26.961 --> 33:28.929
She's at Mimi's party.

33:28.930 --> 33:31.139
It's the stew!

33:31.140 --> 33:32.599
Ambulance, please!

33:32.600 --> 33:34.069
Poley's dead!

33:34.070 --> 33:34.810
What?!

33:34.811 --> 33:36.999
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

33:37.000 --> 33:38.220
Aidan!

33:53.760 --> 33:55.939
What you doing out here?

33:55.940 --> 33:58.148
I went to the airport to pick
Sue and the kids up,

33:58.149 --> 33:59.608
and they weren't there.

33:59.609 --> 34:01.820
The bitch didn't even book a flight.
I checked.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.250
How's Marty?

34:06.480 --> 34:08.179
He's in the flat waiting.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.150
How can I tell him? It'll crush him.

34:37.290 --> 34:39.980
No! It took me ages to put them up!

34:43.650 --> 34:44.159
Fuck!

34:44.161 --> 34:47.589
I'm sorry, Marty,
I am, but just calm down!

34:47.590 --> 34:49.530
Look, I'm here for you.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.270
Come here.

35:04.220 --> 35:06.159
It's never going to happen, is it?

35:06.160 --> 35:10.079
No matter how hard I try.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.560
I've lost them!

35:15.720 --> 35:18.159
I am not going to let you give up.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.630
Trust me.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.959
Awkward.

35:49.960 --> 35:54.380
Clear the pub.
We've got some family issues to sort.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.870
Mum!

36:22.510 --> 36:24.480
So why didn't you come for me, then?

36:24.481 --> 36:27.159
Wanted this place done up.
Ready for you.

36:27.160 --> 36:30.090
Wait till you see the wallpaper
I've picked for your room.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.990
You could've phoned, or a letter?

36:34.991 --> 36:37.680
Supposed to be a surprise.

36:41.590 --> 36:44.519
Anyway, it's not just the flat.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.480
I needed to sort myself out as well.

36:46.481 --> 36:48.190
Been clean for 12 months.

36:51.860 --> 36:53.830
Couldn't have done it without Eddie.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.739
Eddie?!

36:57.740 --> 37:00.909
Volunteer at the prison.

37:00.910 --> 37:02.130
Patty know your here?

37:02.131 --> 37:03.860
I'm not going back.

37:05.320 --> 37:09.239
A couple of days, tops,
while I get your room ready.

37:09.240 --> 37:10.939
I can help decorate.

37:10.940 --> 37:13.150
Come here.

37:16.580 --> 37:18.039
I've missed ya.

37:18.040 --> 37:19.750
I'll just get you that drink.

37:28.820 --> 37:31.509
No! Mum!

37:31.510 --> 37:33.719
You don't know what I've done!

37:33.720 --> 37:36.139
What have you done?

37:36.140 --> 37:37.630
What are you talking about?

37:37.631 --> 37:39.809
Left this in his bedsit.

37:39.810 --> 37:43.239
Getting a bit fucking sloppy,
aren't you?

37:43.240 --> 37:46.169
Shane saw how stressed you were,
so we put the feelers out.

37:46.170 --> 37:48.880
Turns out the little fucker's
dealing for Joe Jangles.

37:48.881 --> 37:52.559
So we got his address, went round
gave him the full Maguire treatment.

37:52.560 --> 37:53.760
He won't be coming back.

37:53.761 --> 37:54.979
He's...?

37:54.980 --> 37:57.929
Ta-da!

37:57.930 --> 38:00.139
Happy birthday, Mam.

38:00.140 --> 38:03.309
Due on the six o'clock
to Billericay.

38:03.310 --> 38:05.279
God give me patience,

38:05.280 --> 38:09.189
cos if he gave me strength
I'd twat the pair of you!

38:09.190 --> 38:11.130
Untie him now!

38:18.720 --> 38:20.178
Marty likes you.

38:20.179 --> 38:21.908
No, he loves you.

38:21.909 --> 38:23.370
Do you love him?

38:23.371 --> 38:25.339
Marty's like family to me.

38:25.340 --> 38:26.800
You liar.

38:26.801 --> 38:28.029
I'm not!

38:28.030 --> 38:31.439
Don't insult me.
I've seen the way you held him,

38:31.440 --> 38:33.639
the way you stared at each other.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.839
You put me up with him so you'd have
a nice little excuse to see him.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.780
The same reason why he let me stay.

38:38.781 --> 38:42.449
The pair of you have been taking me
for a right fucking mug!

38:42.450 --> 38:46.599
Micky, whatever feelings you think
I've got for Marty, you're wrong.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.049
Believe me, Shane is the man I love.

38:49.050 --> 38:51.758
He's the reason that you
and Shane have been fighting.

38:51.759 --> 38:54.210
Shane blames Marty,
but it's not his fault.

38:54.211 --> 38:56.899
Nothing's going on.
Me and Shane are working it out.

38:56.900 --> 38:59.829
I'm not going to interfere.
It's your business.

38:59.830 --> 39:03.019
But if you can't be honest with me,
be honest with yourself.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.960
For your marriage.

39:07.890 --> 39:10.339
Whoa, where's the party?

39:10.340 --> 39:11.830
Where the fuck've you been?

39:13.770 --> 39:15.740
She's been helping me
with some stuff.

39:18.910 --> 39:20.639
Billy's staying.

39:20.640 --> 39:21.838
And he's moving in.

39:21.839 --> 39:22.580
Not happening.

39:22.581 --> 39:24.789
No fucking way he's staying here.

39:24.790 --> 39:27.479
Billy is Cilla's dad,
your sister's father.

39:27.480 --> 39:30.909
Like it or not, you have to respect
that, like I did for you.

39:30.910 --> 39:35.059
When Karen cheated
and ran away with Connor,

39:35.060 --> 39:37.028
I thought good riddance
to the slapper.

39:37.029 --> 39:38.490
But when you forgave her,

39:38.491 --> 39:41.660
who was the only one
to welcome her back with open arms?

39:43.390 --> 39:46.559
I nearly disowned you
when you came home with a prossie,

39:46.560 --> 39:51.449
but you didn't give a shit and you
stuck by her, and I'm glad you did

39:51.450 --> 39:54.879
because Kelly's turned out to be
fucking quality.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.329
And you...

39:57.330 --> 39:58.050
Me?!

39:58.051 --> 40:00.739
We were mortified
when you came home with a pink limo.

40:00.740 --> 40:01.240
It's fu...

40:01.241 --> 40:03.450
Fucking fuchsia, whatever!

40:06.380 --> 40:10.289
I know my own mind, like you lot do

40:10.290 --> 40:15.189
and he may not be perfect,
but he's everything Cilla needs.

40:15.190 --> 40:17.640
And I know he'll make a good dad.

40:20.800 --> 40:24.239
And he's boss at footy, too.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.920
There's no way
he'll ever be one of us.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.279
Billy, this arrangement is for Cilla.

40:45.280 --> 40:48.209
You dare attempt
to look sexy-eyed at me

40:48.210 --> 40:51.640
and I'll send you back to Billericay
a fucking eunuch. Right?

41:10.960 --> 41:15.139
What's going on?
It's my house, it's me son Carl!

41:15.140 --> 41:17.319
Aidan. Where's Aidan? What happened?

41:17.320 --> 41:18.550
Is he OK?

41:18.551 --> 41:22.219
Carl! Carl!

41:22.220 --> 41:24.190
Patty!
Aidan pulled Carl from the house.

41:24.191 --> 41:26.639
If he'd been there any longer...

41:26.640 --> 41:27.860
Where is he?

41:27.861 --> 41:31.030
Carl! Is he alive? Talk to me, son.
Talk to your dad.

41:43.990 --> 41:46.440
Didn't jump out the window, then?

41:48.640 --> 41:51.089
Your stew didn't finish Poley off.

41:51.090 --> 41:53.779
Carbon monoxide poisoning
from his own

41:53.780 --> 41:56.470
half-arsed effort
on the water heater did.

41:57.690 --> 42:01.120
Carl's going to be OK, cos of you.

42:12.380 --> 42:13.600
Patty...

42:15.070 --> 42:17.280
Could you give us a moment, please?

42:19.720 --> 42:20.948
I'm not taking Aidan.

42:20.949 --> 42:22.890
The boy needs to be with his mother.

42:22.891 --> 42:26.559
I'll be good, I promise.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.770
I'll stay in school
and I won't cause trouble.

42:28.771 --> 42:30.239
Please, Mum?

42:30.240 --> 42:32.919
No. You've got to,
or he'll have to go into care.

42:32.920 --> 42:33.910
What?!

42:33.911 --> 42:37.099
I'm clean,
and I want to stay that way.

42:37.100 --> 42:40.509
If I took him back, I'd be on
the streets and shooting up in days.

42:40.510 --> 42:42.719
You want me better, don't you?

42:42.720 --> 42:43.940
Don't you dare blame him
for your shortcomings!

42:43.941 --> 42:45.909
It's true!

42:45.910 --> 42:51.519
I wonder where my years have gone!
Wonder how I'm 29 and look 40!

42:51.520 --> 42:55.939
I wonder why
my life's turned so shit!

42:55.940 --> 42:57.639
I wonder.

42:59.110 --> 43:01.799
I'm not supposed to be a mother!

43:01.800 --> 43:03.519
He's more than you deserve!

43:03.520 --> 43:06.689
You are and always have been
a snotty-nosed,

43:06.690 --> 43:09.379
no-good selfish spiteful whore!

43:09.380 --> 43:10.120
Shut up! Shut up!

43:10.121 --> 43:12.569
You don't justify an ounce of pity!

43:12.570 --> 43:15.019
Patty...

43:15.020 --> 43:17.949
Wait outside.

43:17.950 --> 43:19.920
Please!

43:27.740 --> 43:30.909
You wasn't coming for me, was ya?

43:30.910 --> 43:34.339
You always promised
things would get better.

43:34.340 --> 43:36.310
That you'd change.

43:37.270 --> 43:39.979
They never did...

43:39.980 --> 43:41.680
cos of me?

43:47.560 --> 43:49.750
I'm better off without you.

44:04.200 --> 44:06.140
I'll hold you to that.

44:12.020 --> 44:13.240
Love you.

45:12.690 --> 45:15.379
'I get it now.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.589
'Home isn't bricks and mortar.

45:17.590 --> 45:19.319
'Home is family.

45:19.320 --> 45:21.019
'You can't demolish that.

45:21.020 --> 45:23.710
'We're Grade I. We're listed.'

45:25.170 --> 45:26.639
Home.

45:26.640 --> 45:30.309
'But don't take that for granted,
cos things will fall apart.

45:30.310 --> 45:33.259
There's nothing like a carbon
monoxide poisoned house

45:33.260 --> 45:37.409
'to bring a family back together.
Get me?'

45:37.410 --> 45:40.099
I need cash, so...
I'll have to do a job.

45:40.100 --> 45:41.559
Get a job.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.550
Shut the fuck up! This is a stick up!

45:42.551 --> 45:45.739
You could've got killed yourself,
then what would I have done?

45:45.740 --> 45:46.960
Ten grand reward for somebody
to grass him up.

45:46.961 --> 45:48.429
Maguires don't grass.

45:48.430 --> 45:49.650
Really am thrilled...

45:49.651 --> 45:52.579
Get rid of that boring bastard,
then I'll be impressed.

45:52.580 --> 45:55.269
I didn't mean kill him,
you thick twat!

45:55.270 --> 45:57.959
It's funny you never mentioned
your wife and kids

45:57.960 --> 45:59.180
died in an house fire.

45:59.181 --> 46:03.089
I love you and I want you with me.

46:03.090 --> 46:05.799
I'll be at the bus stop.
Muirfield Avenue.

46:05.800 --> 46:08.490
I've not seen you.

46:41.520 --> 46:48.619
Subs by Red Bee Media Ltd and APOLLO

46:48.620 --> 46:50.799
The ultimate test of trust.

46:50.800 --> 46:53.760
You lift me up like Swayze
does in Dirty Dancing.

46:55.940 --> 46:58.389
We do this, we're solid.

47:07.460 --> 47:10.630
Sorry. No, I'm not!
