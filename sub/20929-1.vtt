01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:33.836
- I asked you how you knew.
- Tom, we talked on the phone.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.720
She called me, and we talked.

01:32:37.400 --> 01:32:39.437
She didn't tell you that?

[DANNY LAUGHS]

01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:45.989
We didn't talk on the phone, Tom.
I read about it on Facebook.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:49.671
You need to relax.
You're a very tense person.

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.677
It's a boy though, right?

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:54.911
Isn't that what they just told her, a son?

01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.759
You're gonna be a father, Tom.
How incredible is that?

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:04.154
What are you gonna name him?

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:09.750
I guess you don't have to answer that
right now. You still got some time.

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:15.159
I have to say, I cannot wait to meet him.
