24:44.266 --> 24:45.266
- Yeah.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.567
- Didn't stop her

24:46.600 --> 24:48.066
from taking down
even the garnish.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.734
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

25:02.266 --> 25:04.567
- Oh.

25:06.133 --> 25:07.233
- Caroline is definitely
bringing the vibe down

25:07.266 --> 25:09.000
for the whole boat.

25:09.033 --> 25:10.000
It's like from one minute
to the next,

25:10.033 --> 25:11.266
it's just hot and cold.

25:11.300 --> 25:13.033
You never know
what you're gonna get.

25:15.233 --> 25:17.000
- Yeah.

25:21.767 --> 25:23.200
It's not personal.

25:23.233 --> 25:25.000
- Yeah, it's fine.

25:25.033 --> 25:26.767
I'm happy that she came
and told me

25:27.000 --> 25:28.700
that the guests
didn't like the food,

25:28.734 --> 25:30.200
but I really don't appreciate
her vibe right now.

25:30.233 --> 25:31.600
I know you're not happy,

25:31.633 --> 25:34.233
but don't project that sh--
on me.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.734
I understand that,
like, you're not doing well--

25:36.767 --> 25:38.200
- Yeah, I know,
keep it to myself.

25:38.233 --> 25:39.233
- It's not even that.

25:39.266 --> 25:40.767
I can see it on your face.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.567
- Well, there's nothing
I can do about it.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.233
You don't know what
I'm dealing with right now,

25:44.266 --> 25:46.000
and it has nothing
to do with the boat.

25:46.033 --> 25:49.033
- Really, okay, my father
just passed away a month ago,

25:49.066 --> 25:52.533
so whatever it is,
I doubt it's that, okay?

25:52.567 --> 25:54.100
So...
- Wow, is this a competition?

25:54.133 --> 25:55.767
- No, it's not, but just,

25:56.000 --> 25:57.333
you know, we all have a lot
of intense sh-- going on,

25:57.367 --> 25:58.567
so just try
and pull yourself together.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.133
- But, yeah, but I'm not you.

26:00.166 --> 26:01.767
- Yeah, but we're all
in this sh-- together.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.333
- Stop judging me.
- I'm not--I'm not judging you.

26:04.367 --> 26:06.133
Were just all working together,
you know,

26:06.166 --> 26:07.367
and when you're
in that attitude,

26:07.400 --> 26:09.000
and then you put it on me,

26:09.033 --> 26:10.233
and then you put it
on everybody else.

26:10.266 --> 26:11.233
If you can't handle your sh--,

26:11.266 --> 26:12.567
then you need to step off.

26:12.600 --> 26:13.767
- Mind your own
----ing business.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.600
- Well, this is my business.

26:15.633 --> 26:17.734
- Dude, I'm sorry you have the
misfortune of working with me.

26:17.767 --> 26:20.133
- Me too.

26:24.700 --> 26:26.166
- Let's go get our jammies on.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.333
- See you guys
bright and early.

26:28.300 --> 26:30.000
You guys'll get
tucked into bed.

26:30.033 --> 26:31.166
- If you want to wear those,
you can.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.633
Wait, wait, wait,
do you have two?

26:32.667 --> 26:34.266
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.133
- Children on boats,
it's a lot of work,

26:36.166 --> 26:37.400
and there's no way around it.

26:37.433 --> 26:39.133
You gotta worry
about the adults,

26:39.166 --> 26:41.100
and then you gotta
worry about the kid stuff.

26:41.133 --> 26:45.333
The only benefit is that after
dinner, it's time to go to bed.

26:45.367 --> 26:47.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:47.033 --> 26:48.266
- So you can go down.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.033
Be on deck at 6:30.
- Okay.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.133
- Are you doing all right?

26:51.166 --> 26:52.133
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay.

26:52.166 --> 26:53.133
You seem like you're crying.

26:53.166 --> 26:55.000
- No, I'm trying not to.

26:55.033 --> 26:56.567
- Why? Well,
that's not really okay.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.000
- Adrian was just like,
"Don't be like that,

26:59.033 --> 27:00.166
'cause it affects me."

27:00.200 --> 27:01.734
And I was like,
"If I'm sad, I'm sad."

27:01.767 --> 27:03.633
And he was like,

27:03.667 --> 27:05.166
"Well, yeah, you know what,
my dad died a month ago."

27:05.200 --> 27:08.400
- Damn, Adrian is a savage.

27:08.433 --> 27:11.233
Um, I'm not sure that was the
best delivery that he gave you,

27:11.266 --> 27:13.233
but I think his advice
is sound.

27:13.266 --> 27:15.667
Try to be your upbeat,
bubbly self

27:15.700 --> 27:17.100
and see how much
better you feel.

27:17.133 --> 27:20.767
- Okay, I'm gonna do that.
- Okay.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.400
- [whispers]
Adrian.

27:22.433 --> 27:24.133
- Savage.

27:31.266 --> 27:33.200
- Will you put, like, plates
and stuff for her

27:33.233 --> 27:35.133
and just flip laundry
and then go to bed?

27:35.166 --> 27:36.166
I'm gonna knock off.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.200

- Last night wasn't
my best performance,

28:42.233 --> 28:44.467
and it reminds me that
at the beginning of my career,

28:44.500 --> 28:47.300
the chefs called me Yes But,
because everything

that I don't know everything.

wanted to be when he grew up,

29:19.567 --> 29:21.200
- Hi, sweetheart.
What's the news?

- I'm just trying to plan
a lunch time for them.

29:23.166 --> 29:25.700

2:00 is the deadline

29:25.734 --> 29:27.100
for getting them over there.

29:55.066 --> 29:56.266
we're gonna do lunch
around 1:00.

29:56.300 --> 29:57.500
We need you guys
ready to get in the tender

- Yeah, everything.

30:06.467 --> 30:08.233
I thought this door
would be open already, but...

30:08.266 --> 30:09.467
We do the same thing
every charter.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.767
Anchor goes down,
get the tenders out,

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
put the toys in, same thing.

30:15.033 --> 30:17.166
Today is no different.

going on an excursion.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.033
- Huh?

30:22.066 --> 30:24.300
- They're going on
an excursion, right,

30:24.333 --> 30:26.333
to swim with the stingrays
and sharks.

for this afternoon?

30:29.066 --> 30:30.433

- Yep.

This charter's a big deal.

I don't want to see
a deer in the headlights.

I want to see the goddamn
light go on over their head.

30:36.433 --> 30:38.300
Wake up, Chandler.

30:38.333 --> 30:40.300
- Are we going up top
to put the slide out?

30:40.333 --> 30:43.133
- Um.

30:43.166 --> 30:44.133
- Coming up...

30:44.166 --> 30:46.200
- Where are the people?

30:46.233 --> 30:47.767
- Hey, it's Albert.
We're ready to get out of here.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.200
We have no towels, no water.

30:49.233 --> 30:50.233
We've had enough
of this experience.

30:54.433 --> 30:55.166
- Hey, Cap, what's the plan

30:55.166 --> 30:55.533
- Hey, Cap, what's the plan
for this afternoon?

30:56.567 --> 30:57.633
Stingrays?
- Yep.

30:57.667 --> 31:00.133
They'll be over there by 2:00.

31:00.166 --> 31:01.633
They'll probably leave the boat
about 1:40.

31:01.667 --> 31:03.233
- Okay.

31:03.266 --> 31:05.066
- The guests
are leaving in an hour,

31:05.100 --> 31:07.133
and we're spending all this
time getting the toys out

31:07.166 --> 31:08.400
when they're not even
gonna be here.

31:08.433 --> 31:12.300
It just makes no sense.

31:12.333 --> 31:13.533
- Okay, we're gonna
set the table.

31:13.567 --> 31:15.233
It's a 1:00 lunch.

31:15.266 --> 31:16.433
- How you ladies doing?
- Good.

31:16.467 --> 31:18.133
- Can I grab you
something to drink?

31:18.166 --> 31:20.266
- Ooh, cucumber jalapeño
champagne might be good.

31:20.300 --> 31:21.567
- Really?

31:21.600 --> 31:23.367
- Yeah, it actually
sounds really good.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.567
- Okay, so just to clarify...
- Yeah.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.300
- What would you like?

31:27.333 --> 31:31.400
- Cucumber jalapeño Prosecco
in the mojito mix.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.133
- Okay.

31:35.567 --> 31:37.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:37.533 --> 31:43.533
- So they requested cucumber
jalapeño mojitos with Prosecco.

31:43.567 --> 31:45.467
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.367
- It's a new day and Caroline
is in a great mood.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.400
Everything's wonderful,

31:49.433 --> 31:52.066
But also I know it's only a
matter of time before she has

31:52.100 --> 31:54.533
another mysterious ailment,
mosquito bite, or something.

31:54.567 --> 31:56.233
- Oh, I need
protective eyewear.

31:56.266 --> 31:58.333
These peppers are hot.

31:58.367 --> 32:00.100
- Rhylee?
- Yes, sir.

32:00.133 --> 32:02.266
- The tow line is not
a priority right now.

32:02.300 --> 32:03.300
We're working
on the water slide.

32:03.333 --> 32:04.667
- Okay.

32:04.700 --> 32:06.633
I know you said to rinse
these off before they go in.

32:06.667 --> 32:08.066
- Can we just put it
out of sight for now?

32:08.100 --> 32:09.533
- Yeah, of course.

32:09.567 --> 32:11.166
- Hang them there and
then we'll rinse them later.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.066
- I just already--
I just rinsed them.

32:13.100 --> 32:14.166
- Okay.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.533
- I don't get it.

32:15.567 --> 32:17.600
I thought I was very explicit
with Chandler.

32:17.633 --> 32:20.367
This charter, you have to have
a very clear line

32:20.400 --> 32:23.667
of communication
so that there is no confusion.

32:23.700 --> 32:27.266
Apparently, it went in one side
and straight out the other

32:27.300 --> 32:29.166
without hitting
any obstructions.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.333
- Can we just hang them there
and we'll get the slide out?

32:31.367 --> 32:32.500
- Yeah, that's what
I was working on.

32:32.533 --> 32:35.467
- Okay, all right,
finish up.

32:35.500 --> 32:36.567
- Your drinks
will be out any minute.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.266
- Okay, good.

32:38.300 --> 32:39.300
- 'Cause we ordered it,
like, ten minutes ago.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.600
- [laughs]

32:40.633 --> 32:42.200
- Oh, perfect.

32:42.233 --> 32:43.734
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

32:43.767 --> 32:45.433
- Oh, wow, that is so good.
Thank you.

32:45.467 --> 32:47.467
- Oh, man.
- Oh my gosh, that is perfect.

32:47.500 --> 32:49.567
- Holy cow, this is amazing.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.266
[air compressor whirring]

32:51.300 --> 32:52.533
- Ross, Ross.

32:52.567 --> 32:53.734
- Yeah, go ahead.

32:53.767 --> 32:55.500
- You and Rhylee
are going to start

32:55.533 --> 32:57.200
prepping the rescue tender
for launch.

32:57.233 --> 32:58.567
- Okay, copy.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.367
- If you guys all want
to have a seat at the table,

33:00.400 --> 33:01.600
I'll tell the chef
to start plating.

33:01.633 --> 33:03.200
- Oh, cool.

33:03.233 --> 33:05.200
- And is that where
you want me right now?

33:05.233 --> 33:06.433
- Yeah, you're driving it

33:06.467 --> 33:08.200
from the crane
to the back of the boat.

33:08.233 --> 33:10.133
- Straight onto the stern,
right there.

33:10.166 --> 33:11.433
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.734
I'm just confirming
with you.

33:12.767 --> 33:14.367
- Oh, come on.

33:18.166 --> 33:19.667
- Okay, so I'm getting
the guests to the table now,

33:19.700 --> 33:21.400
so you can start plating ish.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.133
This needs to stay up.

33:23.166 --> 33:24.367
Get a life, avocado.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.734
Do your job.

33:27.266 --> 33:28.667
- Oh, boy, look at this.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.467
Nice.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.133
- Wow, that looks awesome.

33:33.166 --> 33:34.266
- This is some local fish.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.767
Cilantro and mint-infused
quinoa,

33:37.000 --> 33:38.467
some roasted
cubed potatoes,

33:38.500 --> 33:41.467
and a little salad with
a ponzu and yuzu dressing.

33:41.500 --> 33:42.533
Enjoy.
- Mmm.

33:42.567 --> 33:43.700
- Got some flavor to it.

33:43.734 --> 33:45.133
- This is really good,
that sauce is.

33:45.166 --> 33:46.367
Exactly not boring.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.533
- So, Rhylee,
just pull your bow

33:47.567 --> 33:50.467
and come straight into here.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.667
- Gonna hold on too?

33:51.700 --> 33:53.233
- I'm good,
just hold the pump.

33:53.266 --> 33:54.667
- Yeah, I've got it.

33:54.700 --> 33:56.333
- Hi, they're so thrilled.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.400
They love it so much.
- Awesome.

33:58.433 --> 33:59.700
- This was good.
- Mm-hmm.

33:59.734 --> 34:01.500
- A lot better than last night.
- Mm-hmm.

34:01.533 --> 34:03.500
- Ross and Chandler
to the wheelhouse, please.

34:03.533 --> 34:06.567
- [humming]

34:06.600 --> 34:09.266
- We're gonna use two vessels
to transport them over.

34:09.300 --> 34:11.533
You can take everybody
in the "Intrepid"

34:11.567 --> 34:13.367
up till you run out of water.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.400
Then you've got to put them
in the rescue tender.

34:15.433 --> 34:17.166
- Easy.

34:17.200 --> 34:19.233
- And then you'll repeat
the procedure in reverse.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.633
- All right, thank you.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.166
- I think we should
probably grab our sandals.

34:22.200 --> 34:23.567
- Grab a life jacket
before we go.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.533
- Do we have dry bags set up
for them for towels and...

34:26.567 --> 34:28.300
- Yeah, Rhylee
had it all set up.

34:28.333 --> 34:29.600
- I don't want to deal
with her right now.

34:30.767 --> 34:32.500
- I'm staying.

34:32.533 --> 34:34.533
- With this many charter guests
on this trip,

34:34.567 --> 34:35.767
Chandler should go.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.433
There's so much
that can go wrong,

34:37.467 --> 34:39.266
and he's the bosun.

34:39.300 --> 34:41.266
- Does anybody
have to go potty?

34:41.300 --> 34:42.567
both: No.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.000
- All right, let's go, guys.
Come on.

34:44.033 --> 34:45.667
- We've got drinks.
We've got towels.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.233
- How much in each bag?

34:50.367 --> 34:51.400
- We got everything
on board we need?

34:51.433 --> 34:52.400
- We're good to go, Cap.

34:52.433 --> 34:53.467
- Okay, we'll load them up.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.467
- Let's go for our excursion.

34:54.500 --> 34:58.700
- There we go.

34:58.734 --> 35:00.533
- I'm pulling away
from the boat.

35:00.567 --> 35:02.300
- Sharks and stingrays.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.367
- Come up on that mooring
buoy just at your 4:00.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.000
- So we gotta get you
off onto this boat now

35:06.033 --> 35:07.500
just to tender you further in

35:07.533 --> 35:09.633
'cause we've got too much
of a drop to get closer.

35:09.667 --> 35:11.400
- So the sharks,

35:11.433 --> 35:13.433
not my ideal activity

35:13.467 --> 35:14.734
for four- and five-year-old
children, but...

35:14.767 --> 35:16.333
- Yeah.

35:16.367 --> 35:17.734
- Is this the place,
right, Ashton?

35:17.767 --> 35:19.567
- Yeah, I was pointed
to that dock.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.233
- They're small sharks,
about the size of those kids.

35:22.266 --> 35:23.266
- [laughs]

35:23.300 --> 35:24.467
- Hey, kids, come on up.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.266
- Yeah!

35:26.300 --> 35:29.467
- Try those.
- I'm ready for everything.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.300
- Follow Daddy.
I'm right behind you.

35:31.333 --> 35:32.467
- Stingrays are
super friendly.

35:32.500 --> 35:35.734
[upbeat music]

35:35.767 --> 35:37.467
- They've got snorkel
up there.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.333
- Oh, that's fine.

35:39.367 --> 35:40.734
- They've got snorkel,
everything there?

35:40.767 --> 35:44.500
- Chandler, Chandler, Ashton.

35:44.533 --> 35:47.233
Chandler, Chandler,
do you copy?

35:48.667 --> 35:51.533
- Do you want me to go back to
the boat now or hang out here?

35:51.567 --> 35:53.567
- I don't know.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.667
- Motoryacht, "My Seanna."
- Go ahead.

35:55.700 --> 35:58.467
- Would you like me
to come back to "My Seanna,"

35:58.500 --> 36:00.467
or would you like me
to wait here for the guests?

36:00.500 --> 36:02.767
- They're supposed to call when
they're ready to be picked up.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.367
- Copy that.

36:04.400 --> 36:07.100
- Ross, we're
heading back, okay?

36:07.133 --> 36:09.266
- Okay.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.300
- [screams]

36:10.333 --> 36:11.300
[laughs]

36:11.333 --> 36:13.467
- There's a stingray, Daddy.

36:13.500 --> 36:17.367
- My nose wasn't
feeling right in the mask.

36:17.400 --> 36:18.767
- God, these things
are so slimy.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.734
They're all over me.
[screams]

36:29.367 --> 36:32.633
- I guess we're standing by
till they want us up there.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.000
- What's up, then, brother?
Do you know?

36:44.033 --> 36:45.266
- I think we're
just standing by.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.667
Just get the boat ready.

36:46.700 --> 36:50.100
[cell phone rings]

36:50.133 --> 36:52.000
- Excuse me.

36:52.033 --> 36:53.467
Hello?

36:53.500 --> 36:54.734
- Kate, it's Albert.

36:54.767 --> 36:56.433
- Hey, Albert, how are you?

36:56.467 --> 36:59.000
- Uh, we're ready
to get out of here for sure.

36:59.033 --> 37:00.567
We've had enough
of this experience.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.467
Didn't go so well.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.100
- I'm so sorry to hear that.
Is everything all right?

37:04.133 --> 37:07.333
- We have no towels, no water,
so, uh...

37:07.367 --> 37:09.600
- Okay, I'll send
the tender right over.

37:09.633 --> 37:11.033
- Yeah, thank you very much.

37:11.066 --> 37:12.700
All right, Kate.
- Bye.

37:12.734 --> 37:15.367
Hey, deck crew, deck crew,
Kate.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.066
The guests are just
out of water, no towels.

37:18.100 --> 37:22.033
They're ready to be
picked up immediately.

37:22.066 --> 37:23.533
- Copy.

37:23.567 --> 37:25.033
- What the (BLEEP)?

37:25.066 --> 37:26.367
- Yeah, they're
so thirsty right now.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.467
- They'll be here soon.
They better.

37:32.633 --> 37:33.166
- Hey, deck crew,

37:33.166 --> 37:33.433
- Hey, deck crew,
deck crew, Kate.

37:35.133 --> 37:37.633
The guests are just
out of water, no towels.

37:37.667 --> 37:40.000
They're ready to be
picked up immediately.

37:40.033 --> 37:42.000
- Copy.
- What the (BLEEP)?

37:42.033 --> 37:43.367
- Yeah, they're
so thirsty right now.

37:43.400 --> 37:44.400
- They'll be here soon.

37:44.433 --> 37:45.467
They better.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.734
- So what happened?

37:46.767 --> 37:47.734
- I don't know who
has the game plan,

37:47.767 --> 37:49.100
who makes the game plan.

37:53.133 --> 37:55.400
- I have no ----ing idea
what's going on.

37:55.433 --> 37:56.600
I don't really understand

37:56.633 --> 37:58.033
how you can take someone
for an excursion

37:58.066 --> 37:59.500
and take all their sh--
with you.

37:59.533 --> 38:01.000
Feel like that's a no-brainer.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.066
- Hey, come back, bro.

38:09.100 --> 38:11.033
Hey, yeah, Chandler, Chandler,
just come back, bro.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.100
- You just
come around this point.

38:14.133 --> 38:15.400
- It's just that point, yeah.

38:19.433 --> 38:20.767
- Do it.
I'll just come with you.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.633
- We ----ed up big time.

38:23.667 --> 38:25.400
- Here, you just take it.

38:25.433 --> 38:27.100
You know where you're going.

38:27.133 --> 38:28.767
- When they come back
on the yacht,

38:29.000 --> 38:32.200
we don't want them to carry
the bad mood from the exterior

38:32.233 --> 38:33.700
into the interior.

38:33.734 --> 38:35.033
- Should we make, like,
a little cocktail?

38:35.066 --> 38:36.767
- Yes.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.500
If anybody besides me, Josiah,
and Adrian could do something

38:40.533 --> 38:43.233
to help the guests enjoy
Tahiti, that would be great.

38:43.266 --> 38:44.767
- Kate, can I get you
up to the bow?

38:45.000 --> 38:46.166
- Copy.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.500
Hey, Captain Lee.

38:47.533 --> 38:48.734
So I just got a call
from the primary.

38:48.767 --> 38:50.567
They're ready to be picked up.

38:50.600 --> 38:54.033
He sounded a little
under duress.

38:54.066 --> 38:56.200
- When I have to sit there
and eat a sh-- sandwich

38:56.233 --> 39:00.066
in a totally correctable
and foreseeable situation,

39:00.100 --> 39:01.734
there just aren't words
to describe

39:01.767 --> 39:04.266
what a colossal (BLEEP) up
it is.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.200
I don't know.

39:06.233 --> 39:09.000
- Okay.
- See if we can't fix this.

39:09.033 --> 39:10.200
- Yep.

39:12.533 --> 39:14.100
- Hey, you wanna
swing my bow around?

39:14.133 --> 39:15.533
- Yep.
- Thank goodness.

39:15.567 --> 39:16.633
- Hallelujah.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.734
- There's beers and waters
and towels.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.033
- Hey, Rhylee, Rhylee, Kate.

39:27.066 --> 39:29.233
Can you be on the swim platform
when the guests return

39:29.266 --> 39:31.667
with some beach towels
and some water?

39:31.700 --> 39:33.033
- Absolutely.

39:36.166 --> 39:37.633
- Ready?

39:42.100 --> 39:43.700
- Are all the guests
in the "Intrepid"?

39:43.734 --> 39:45.533
- Yes, sir.

39:45.567 --> 39:48.533
- Well, I guess I'll go face
the ----ing music.

39:51.066 --> 39:52.700
- Big? They were
bigger than you?

39:52.734 --> 39:54.033
- Yeah.

39:54.066 --> 39:55.166
- [gasps]
That's pretty big.

39:55.200 --> 39:56.767
- Caroline,
what you doing?

39:57.000 --> 39:58.500
- Where would you like me?

39:58.533 --> 39:59.567
- Will you just fold
and turn laundry?

39:59.600 --> 40:01.066
Thank you.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.533
- Hi, we've got
piña coladas for you.

40:03.567 --> 40:04.734
- Extra premium?

40:04.767 --> 40:06.467
- Yes, actually,
there's a floater

40:06.500 --> 40:09.000
and there's gold on top.

40:09.033 --> 40:10.700
- Oh, wow, so cute.
Thank you, guys.

40:10.734 --> 40:13.033
- A dinosaur.

40:13.066 --> 40:14.567
- Sweet, thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.033
- There they go.

40:16.066 --> 40:17.667
- Oh, she went
down the slide.

40:17.700 --> 40:19.567
- Think we're glad to be back
with some beverages...

40:19.600 --> 40:21.166
[indistinct]

40:21.200 --> 40:23.300
Little short-lived
of a snorkeling trip, but--

40:23.333 --> 40:24.667
- My apologies, sir.

40:24.700 --> 40:28.066
I will, uh--
I don't know what to say.

40:28.100 --> 40:30.066
- Yeah, just giving you
a little heads-up.

40:30.100 --> 40:32.233
I mean, uh...
- Doesn't happen on my boats.

40:32.266 --> 40:33.333
- Yeah.

40:33.367 --> 40:35.266
- As uncomfortable as I am

40:35.300 --> 40:37.333
in this situation with
our charter guests right now,

40:37.367 --> 40:40.000
it's nothing compared
to how uncomfortable

40:40.033 --> 40:41.734
I'm gonna make
our deck crew feel.

40:41.767 --> 40:45.533
- Well, I'm a little more chill
about things than my wife,

40:45.567 --> 40:48.200
but I probably won't hear
the end of it, unfortunately.

40:48.233 --> 40:49.734
- We had
everything on board,

40:49.767 --> 40:53.533
and I don't know why they
neglected to disperse it.

40:53.567 --> 40:56.100
- Yeah.
- But I will find out.

40:56.133 --> 40:58.734
- Thank you.
- Make it up to you.

41:01.266 --> 41:03.133
- Captain, would you like
some dinner?

41:03.166 --> 41:05.567
- No, I'm gonna eat
somebody's ass for dinner.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.633
- Ooh.
