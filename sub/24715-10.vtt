00:05.213 --> 00:06.297
I'm just glad you're feeling better.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.843
I was afraid if I told you
I'd scare you off.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.971
-You could have trusted me.
-I know that now.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.890
And I want you to know
I'm seeing my shrink again.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.268
-Plus, I'm back on my meds.
-That's great.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.104
It'd be a lot easier if I knew you were
gonna be there at the other end.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.064
I'll be here.
You don't have to worry about that.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.317
So, now, we can start over?

00:27.152 --> 00:28.987
Sure, Jen. But the important thing
right now

00:29.070 --> 00:30.655
is for you to take care of yourself.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.658

I mean, sexually.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.169

01:42.727 --> 01:44.104
I've never been this happy.

01:44.229 --> 01:47.273
But when I take the pills,
it's like I'm on a leash,

01:47.398 --> 01:51.027
and you're there,
but you're just out of reach.

01:51.152 --> 01:53.446

That's not an option.

01:55.824 --> 01:56.825

Remember when we were gonna meet

02:58.803 --> 03:00.847
at the flea market
on 26th Street one Sunday?

03:01.181 --> 03:03.892
-Yeah.
-And I was looking around,

03:03.975 --> 03:06.352
and I turned and spotted you
walking towards me,

03:06.436 --> 03:09.314
and you had this big smile on your face,

03:10.356 --> 03:14.068
and it made my heart feel so warm
because I thought...

03:15.695 --> 03:19.449
"This is my man,
and he looks so happy to see me."

03:20.116 --> 03:22.577

of everything around me.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.842
And yesterday, I saw two Russian guys

06:24.926 --> 06:28.346
sitting in a car outside talking,
and it seemed

06:28.513 --> 06:31.182
-like they were watching the building.
-Did you hear what those guys were saying?

06:31.516 --> 06:32.850
I don't understand Russian. I...

06:33.226 --> 06:35.770
I'd love to learn it though,
just to read Dostoyevsky in the original.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.022
Yeah, me, too.
What'd the guys look like?

06:38.398 --> 06:40.817
Very similar and very Slavic.

06:41.776 --> 06:45.905
Uh. Mid-thirties. The driver
had a Julius Caesar haircut.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.117
Both their heads were round
like bowling balls with distant-set eyes.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.868
They wore black leather jackets

06:51.035 --> 06:54.747
with unbuttoned silk shirts, gold chains,
and they smoked unfiltered cigarettes

06:54.872 --> 06:57.250
that they rolled themselves.
I checked after they left.

-What kind of car was that, again?
-A newer blue Impala.

07:01.003 --> 07:04.132
I wrote the plate number down
because they had a look in their eyes

07:04.257 --> 07:07.427
that just said badness.

07:08.177 --> 07:13.057
I feel really terrible for Maureen.
She was... an elegant girl.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.267
Yeah. We heard.

-Anything else you can think of?
-That's it.

Maureen got assaulted in her building.

-She broke a rule about cellphone calls.

re-explaining the rules,

12:47.057 --> 12:49.894
she threw her phone against the wall
and called me names.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.395

13:03.449 --> 13:05.826
Friend of mine said that you
shoot pictures of convicts.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.579
-That's right.
-Any of 'em owe you favors?

13:08.871 --> 13:10.414
-I don't understand.
-JOHN: A favor.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.917
Like, "My assistant's a thief.
I need her ass kicked."

13:13.042 --> 13:15.836
'Cause you don't look like somebody
who gets her hands dirty personally.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.297
I don't think I have anything else
to say to you.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.008
If you did pull a contract,
you want to tell us now,

13:21.133 --> 13:24.178
'cause it didn't go according to plan.
The girl's dead.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.806
-Maureen's dead.
-JOHN: Shot twice.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.850
-Wow.
-Yeah, lady. Wow!

13:30.392 --> 13:31.727
And when we pull your phone records

13:31.811 --> 13:34.355
and find contact with a con
who rolls over on you,

13:34.563 --> 13:36.357
because he knows the system
better than you,

13:36.482 --> 13:37.733
that's gonna be a huge wow,

13:37.858 --> 13:39.819
because you'll be looking
at felony murder.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.779
I've had enough.
I need to talk to my attorney.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.114
That's putting up a red flag to us,
calling an attorney.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.159
I didn't do anything to Maureen,
and I have no more time for this,

13:47.326 --> 13:48.828
so, you'll just have to deal
with my lawyer.

There's a Brad Cutshall downstairs,
says he needs to talk to a detective.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.048
Send him up.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.801
No record for Ilya Antropov, boss.
Visa's clean.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.010
Where's Andy and John?

14:05.094 --> 14:07.221
They're on their way back
from the DOA's former employer.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.140
They said the lady lawyered up,
and she's worth a further look.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.184
All right, get Ilya's current information,
then kick him.

14:13.060 --> 14:16.939
-Excuse me. I'm Brad Cutshall.
-Uh. What is this regarding, Mr. Cutshall?

14:17.064 --> 14:18.983
Uh. My... my car's been
getting broken into.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.819
All right, uh, you have any time
before your appointment?

14:21.944 --> 14:24.697
Yeah, uh, have a seat, Mr. Cutshall.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.493
So, uh, you've been parking on the street?

14:29.743 --> 14:30.911
BRAD: (SIGHS) Yes.

14:31.787 --> 14:34.415
-Same place every night?
-Yeah, just about. (SIGHS)

14:34.707 --> 14:36.625
CONNIE: Anyone you can think of
who'd be doing this?

14:37.084 --> 14:38.210
No.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.713
Uh. Lots of kids in the neighborhood?
Maybe playing a prank?

14:40.838 --> 14:41.839
Maybe.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.968
All right. Well, let me get your address
and where you park your car and...

14:46.302 --> 14:48.262
-What are you doing?
-BRAD: This is a bomb!

14:48.470 --> 14:52.266
If you don't release Ilya...
Ilya Antropov in one hour,

14:52.391 --> 14:53.601
-it'll be blown up.
-ANDY: Hey!

14:53.851 --> 14:56.228
Andy, don't move! Nobody move!

(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

14:58.814 --> 15:01.025
-Are you friends with Ilya?
-No. No, they abducted me.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.320
They took my daughter.
These cuffs are wired to the detonator.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.322
They'll be calling me to make sure
I'm here and I have to answer

15:06.405 --> 15:07.448
on the first ring.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.325
-Who's "they"?
-BRAD: I don't know!

15:09.700 --> 15:12.745
Please, please, just do what they ask,
or the bomb goes off!

Make sure they know what this guy said
about that bomb

15:37.686 --> 15:39.521
-being booby-trapped.
-I... I told them.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.483

-Talk to the Russian.

-He's not going anywhere.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.324

15:59.458 --> 16:01.460
-You know a Brad Cutshall?
-No.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.129
He just walked in here with a bomb
secured to his body.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.465
He handcuffed himself
to a detective upstairs.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.008
He's demanding your release.

16:08.384 --> 16:12.012
-My re... I don't know this person.
-He's saying somebody put him up to it.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.806
-And he has a bomb?
-Who's doing this?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.724
-No... I don't know.
-JOHN: You are not gonna get released,

16:16.016 --> 16:18.060
not as long as that bomb
is next to our detective.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.063
So, all it's gonna do is gonna get you,
and whoever works for you

16:21.188 --> 16:23.774
-in serious trouble.
-But, I... I don't know what is happening.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.777
Lose the bus boy act, you understand me?

16:27.903 --> 16:33.200
-Now, what is going on? (BREATHES HEAVILY)
-Okay. Okay. I... I talk to you now.

16:36.620 --> 16:40.916
In my country, I was leader of, uh...
you call it rebel group, yes?

16:42.042 --> 16:45.629
I have people here who are in this group.
They are very loyal to me.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.965
Some of them must have heard
I was taken to the police.

16:48.048 --> 16:49.341
Now they're doing this to let me out.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.135
-Who? I want names.
-I don't know.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.179
-You're gonna give me names.
-I swear to you, I don't know.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.683
Our group is now...
(STUTTERS) ...scattered.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.601
Still very loyal.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.563
-Then you call it off.
-I don't know how.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.899
-Do it.
-Please, listen to me.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.902
For my people, something like this...

17:09.486 --> 17:12.114
Using violence to protect each other...
it's very easy.

17:12.781 --> 17:16.326
You should let me go.
If you do, they will not use the bomb.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.079
When it comes to protecting
someone in my life,

17:19.496 --> 17:21.623
violence is very easy for me, too.

17:22.207 --> 17:26.170
If anything happens
to that detective upstairs, you're dead.

17:26.712 --> 17:31.175
-Do you understand?
-Just let me go. Nothing will happen.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.231
-Brad?
-They told me not to say anything

17:46.815 --> 17:48.650
unless it's about Mr. Antropov
being released.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.736
-But they're not here right now.
-Yeah.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.782
So I need you to tell me
everything you know, or...

17:56.241 --> 17:59.661
-we have to assume you're involved.
-I swear to you, I'm not.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.456
-Did they give you that phone to use?
-No, it's mine.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.042
I need you to write down
that number for me.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.461
No, they told me not to do anything
but sit here,

18:07.878 --> 18:09.171
or they'd kill my daughter.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.800
The only way to prevent that
is by cooperating.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.551
All you have to do
is release Ilya Antropov.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.345
They're working on that.

18:17.846 --> 18:21.934
Meantime, I want that cellphone number,
right now.

that they're calling in on.

-Who planted the bomb?
-He says he doesn't know.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.657
-Were they Russian guys?
-Yeah.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.742
-Had you ever met 'em before?
-No.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.035
How's that work, Brad?

18:40.160 --> 18:41.578
BRAD: I was walking my daughter to school.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.374
We got grabbed off the street,
put in a van, and blindfolded. (SNIFFLES)

18:45.499 --> 18:48.418

they'd kill her.

-Where'd they take you?
-BRAD: I don't know.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.673
Will you please release
Ilya Antropov now?

18:52.881 --> 18:54.883
What street were you taken from?

18:55.259 --> 18:58.637
I'm here.

-Squad room.
-The squad room.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.224
-I did everything you said.
-Say we need to talk to 'em.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.269
-The police wanna talk to you.
-TONY: Tell 'em to call on a land line

19:05.477 --> 19:06.728
because that cell signal might
set the bomb off.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.899
He heard you. He doesn't care.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.317
Tell him if there's gonna be
anything worked out,

19:12.442 --> 19:13.777
we need to talk to him.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.699
-He's gone.
-ANDY: Brad, if you got any control

19:18.824 --> 19:20.951
of this situation,
you tell us now and let us help you.

19:21.076 --> 19:24.872
I don't! (SNIFFLES)
No, I can't talk any more.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.665
(SNIFFLES) I just want my daughter back.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.501
First tell us where you and your
daughter were abducted from.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.296
I don't know! You're wasting time.

19:32.462 --> 19:35.132
Take it easy, Brad.
We'll be back in a little while.

-Connie?
-I'm all right.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.098
They're concerned 'cause I'm pregnant.

this Ilya's photo,

19:53.066 --> 19:55.027
but their Russian expert
is coming in from Philadelphia.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.697
-We got one hour.
-Yeah. Well, that's the best they can do.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.575
I guess there's not a lot of intel
on, uh, Russian rebel leaders.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.952
This guy's Russian mafia.
That's how we're playing this first.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.538
-Not a lot on Russian mafia, either.
-TONY: Hey, Josh.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.790
This is Cutshall's cellphone number,
all right?

20:08.874 --> 20:11.043
Have Tararu start tracking
all incoming calls.

20:11.126 --> 20:12.502
-See if they can clone it.
-You got it.

wife died three years ago.

Uh. He owns a diner... No priors.

is somehow involved with these Russians?

-ANDY: We don't know.
-All right.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.311
You two get back to the DOA's
apartment and search.

related to this mess.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.695
Take that son of a bitch up from the cells
and cuff him to Cutshall.

Next time his boys call,
tell them if the bomb goes, he goes.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.576
Yeah, if it does, we go up for murder.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.662
Not a jury in the world would convict us.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.455

How did they know
we had their boss in here?

ain't crawling with Russians.

when we were walking out.

-Yeah.
-Yeah, that old man definitely knew

I wrote down was helpful?

got the ball rolling.

-But no one's in custody?
-That's correct.

21:39.923 --> 21:43.093
Uh. Did the DOA talk to you at all
about her former boss, a photographer?

when she fell down the stairs,

this is infinitely worse.

-No clue.

-No. Why?
-RITA: You have a roommate?

I don't. I mean, my dad has been staying
with me the last few weeks.

-Where's he?
-Out. He does volunteer work.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.659
We need to talk to him.

He didn't know anything
about the cat, either.

on the phone, please?

33:20.039 --> 33:22.583
a week earlier,
maybe that was a warning from someone.

33:22.834 --> 33:26.421
And the DOA getting shot from behind,
maybe they were gunning for Katie instead.

33:26.671 --> 33:29.048
Either way, the dad's the only one
in that building with a criminal past.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.926
All right, give me the address.
I'll take this.

33:38.141 --> 33:40.476
-BARRY: Yes?
-Detective Clark, 15th Squad.

33:40.601 --> 33:41.686
(DOOR UNLOCKS)

33:42.186 --> 33:43.938
Oh, you looking for Katie?
'Cause she went back to work.

33:44.105 --> 33:47.775
-JOHN: No, I'm looking for you.
-Is there... is there a problem?

33:47.900 --> 33:50.069
At my precinct right now,
there's a guy with a bomb.

33:50.236 --> 33:53.281
He was sent there to try and free
a Russian who we have in custody.

33:53.740 --> 33:57.952
-He says his name Is Ilya Antropov.
-Never seen him before in my life.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.748
-You ever been arrested, Barry?
-No.

34:01.998 --> 34:03.124
-Drug problem?
-(BARRY CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

34:03.332 --> 34:06.002
I experimented with pot in college.
What's the problem, detective?

34:06.085 --> 34:07.211
I'll tell you what the problem is.

34:07.587 --> 34:11.090
I've dealt with crackheads a lot,
and the policy is always a lie first,

34:11.215 --> 34:14.927
but eventually, after a couple of hours,
they finally get to the truth.

34:15.261 --> 34:18.056
Now, normally,
I'd play that game with you,

34:18.639 --> 34:20.266
but I don't have the time right now,

34:20.600 --> 34:23.978
so you're gonna tell me
what's going on right now

34:24.145 --> 34:27.815
next thing out of your mouth.
If you don't, I lock you up,

34:27.982 --> 34:29.150
make sure you do time,

34:29.609 --> 34:33.112
Right after I punch you
in the face about 15 times.

34:34.197 --> 34:37.366
Okay, okay, okay.
I have a small drug problem.

34:37.492 --> 34:38.951
My daughter doesn't know
anything about it.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.411
Oh, bullshit she doesn't know!

34:40.620 --> 34:42.205
And you're dragging her down
along with you!

34:43.122 --> 34:44.749
Those Russians who killed
that girl this morning,

34:44.999 --> 34:46.250
they were looking to kill Katie,
weren't they?

34:47.251 --> 34:48.503
Answer me!

34:48.711 --> 34:51.380
They threatened to kill both of us.
I didn't know what to do.

34:51.547 --> 34:52.715
They screwed up.

34:52.882 --> 34:56.302
They set a bomb up in a police station.
They are going away.

34:56.886 --> 35:00.473
-I don't want to die.
-You won't, if you tell me who they are!

35:01.766 --> 35:04.936
-Barry!
-His name is Victor Potvan.

35:05.061 --> 35:06.979
I drop off the money
at the Moldova Social Club

35:07.105 --> 35:09.440
-at Brighton Beach.
-You ever see this guy, Ilya?

35:09.649 --> 35:11.692
I've seen him once.
He... he's the boss, I think.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.236
(GRUNTS)

35:13.945 --> 35:15.988
I owe them 50 grand.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.740
You got a lot of people
in danger over this.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.200
If you would have told
the truth earlier...

35:19.408 --> 35:22.203
-I didn't know what to do. I'm sorry.
-Shut up!

35:25.665 --> 35:27.792
Your guy said he was dealing
with a Russian named Potvan

35:27.875 --> 35:29.460
-he'd meet at the Moldova Social Club?
-TONY: Yeah.

35:29.877 --> 35:31.379
Now, we've had that social club up awhile.

35:31.671 --> 35:34.215
Three times we've heard them say
a heavy hitter was coming in from London.

35:34.423 --> 35:35.716
-Yeah, that could be anybody.
-DAN: It could,

35:36.092 --> 35:39.053
but Potvan is the brother-in-law
of a big time mobster named Ilya Rogalav,

35:39.512 --> 35:41.430
wanted in Moscow for drugs
and trafficking pross

35:41.597 --> 35:44.475
-and in London for three homicides.
-He was giving us the name, Ilya Antropov.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.228
Seven months ago,
Ilya fell off the map in London.

35:47.436 --> 35:50.523
Early last year, his wife and son
were granted visas into the States.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.233
Are we saying Ilya shot
our DOA this morning?

35:52.608 --> 35:54.777
From what we've got, he's more
of a behind-the-scenes guy.

35:54.861 --> 35:57.196
Yeah, but when word got out that Ilya
was taken in by the police,

35:57.280 --> 35:59.323
his boys must have thought
we took him in for the homicide.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.367
That or you were bringing him in
on the warrants in Moscow

36:01.534 --> 36:03.286
or London,
which would put him away forever.

36:03.494 --> 36:04.829
We were gonna let him walk out the door.

36:04.954 --> 36:07.331
Ilya's crew here is very violent
and very stupid.

36:07.415 --> 36:09.750
This is right in their kitchen
to jump the gun like this.

36:09.876 --> 36:10.960
Where's this guy's family?
Where do they live?

36:11.043 --> 36:13.296
We think we have them under
a phony name on Ninth Street.

36:13.421 --> 36:15.464
Give me everything you got.
We need Clark back on the phone.

36:21.470 --> 36:23.598
I don't understand why no one's
talked to us for so long.

36:24.473 --> 36:26.267
Everyone's working as hard as they can.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.520
Maybe I should try to take this thing off.

36:29.979 --> 36:33.482
-No, Brad, leave it alone.
-Did you hear that bomb outside?

36:33.566 --> 36:37.028
I did, but messing with that device
is a bad idea.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.196
We got, like, minutes here.

36:38.738 --> 36:41.741
-Brad, take it easy.
-Where you been? What's going on?

36:41.866 --> 36:45.703
We're taking care of things.
Now, I need you to hand me that cellphone.

36:46.537 --> 36:49.248
No way. No way.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.292
I need you to give it to me.
The guy downstairs

36:51.375 --> 36:53.377
doesn't know how to get a hold
of who's calling you,

36:53.544 --> 36:56.214
so we need the phone. Now, real calm.

36:56.839 --> 36:58.341
We just don't want to jostle you.

36:58.716 --> 37:01.093
-What if they call, and I don't answer?
-We're gonna handle it.

37:02.428 --> 37:05.348
-You gotta do it now, Brad.
-I can't.

37:05.932 --> 37:09.936
Brad, that's my husband. I trust him.
You can, too.

-Not to worry.

Your son absolutely needs to worry
if you don't do what I told you.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.324
Do you believe me when I told you

38:05.408 --> 38:07.535
I didn't know they would
do this for me, the bomb?

38:07.660 --> 38:08.703
ANDY: I don't give a damn.

38:08.995 --> 38:12.415
Either you call it off or people
you care about are gonna suffer.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.752
'Cause I'll take your boy upstairs,

38:17.086 --> 38:20.840
and I will cuff him to that bomb,
just like my wife is.

after they let the girl go.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.165
