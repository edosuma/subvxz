08:39.208 --> 08:40.625
AT THE GOAT HOUSE.

08:40.667 --> 08:44.166
ALL RIGHT, JUST CALL ME, OK?

08:44.208 --> 08:45.667
WHAT'S UP BUD?

08:45.709 --> 08:46.917
-BAD NEWS ABOUT RACHEL.

08:46.959 --> 08:48.458
-WHAT?

08:48.500 --> 08:51.208
-I WAS AT HER PLACE, SOMEONE

08:48.500 --> 08:51.208
CALLED, AND I HEARD HER VOICE

08:51.250 --> 08:54.125
ON HER ANSWERING MACHINE

08:51.250 --> 08:54.125
MESSAGE.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.750
IT'S THE WORST VOICE I'VE EVER

08:54.166 --> 08:56.750
HEARD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

08:56.792 --> 08:59.166
-COME ON, MAN, I MEAN

08:56.792 --> 08:59.166
HOW BAD CAN IT BE?

08:59.208 --> 09:00.166
(SCREECHY VOICE) -HELLO?

09:00.208 --> 09:01.125
HELLO?

09:01.166 --> 09:02.083
JUST KIDDING.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.542
I'M NOT HERE.

09:03.583 --> 09:08.291
LEAVE A MESSAGE AND ENJOY

09:03.583 --> 09:08.291
A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.250
-OH, WOW.

09:09.291 --> 09:10.208
-YEAH.

09:10.250 --> 09:11.750
-YOU SHOULD BREAK UP WITH HER.

09:11.792 --> 09:13.750
-YEAH. HER VOICE

09:11.792 --> 09:13.750
ISN'T BACK YET.

09:13.792 --> 09:16.208
I'VE DECIDED TO MAKE THE MOST

09:13.792 --> 09:16.208
OUT OF OUR SHORT TIME THAT WE

09:16.250 --> 09:17.166
HAVE LEFT TOGETHER.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.166
-YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:18.208 --> 09:19.166
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.000
I'M SO SORRY.

09:20.041 --> 09:20.875
I, I'VE GOT TO GO.

09:26.458 --> 09:29.333
-WHAT ARE NERDS DOING

09:26.458 --> 09:29.333
INSIDE OF MY HOUSE?

09:29.375 --> 09:30.834
-I INVITED THEM.

09:30.875 --> 09:32.959
YEAH, SINCE I'M STILL THE

09:30.875 --> 09:32.959
CAPTAIN AND YOU'VE TURNED OVER

09:33.000 --> 09:36.166
THIS NEW LEAF OF POSITIVITY,

09:33.000 --> 09:36.166
THAT EXTENDS ITSELF TO THOSE

09:36.208 --> 09:38.625
YOU PREVIOUSLY DISLIKED.

09:38.667 --> 09:42.583
-WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COCAINE,

09:38.667 --> 09:42.583
OR A MOJITO?

09:42.625 --> 09:43.875
-OH.

09:46.500 --> 09:47.875
I SEE WHAT THIS IS.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.291
-HMM?

09:49.333 --> 09:53.875
-YOU WANT TO SEE ME FAIL, MORAN,

09:49.333 --> 09:53.875
BUT MY WILL IS STRONGER

09:53.917 --> 09:59.208
THAN 10,000 PELICANS.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.250
NAMASTE.

10:03.250 --> 10:06.375
-OKAY, RACHEL, KEEP YOUR

10:03.250 --> 10:06.375
SPIRITS UP AND I'LL

10:06.417 --> 10:08.083
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

10:08.125 --> 10:09.917
-YOU GO AHEAD, SWEETHEART.

10:09.959 --> 10:10.875
I'LL, UH, I'LL BE RIGHT

10:09.959 --> 10:10.875
BEHIND YOU.

10:10.917 --> 10:11.709
OK?

10:11.750 --> 10:12.667
GET OUT OF HERE.

10:15.667 --> 10:18.542
I DON'T WANT YOU TO SUGARCOAT

10:15.667 --> 10:18.542
THIS DOC.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.250
HOW LONG DOES SHE HAVE?

10:20.291 --> 10:21.625
-THE LARYNGITIS?

10:21.667 --> 10:22.458
TWO, THREE DAYS, TOPS.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.959
-WHEW.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.792
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS

10:24.000 --> 10:25.792
HOPING TO HEAR.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.792
-IF, IF SHE GARGLES WITH SALT

10:25.834 --> 10:28.792
WATER AND HUMIDIFIES HER ROOM

10:28.834 --> 10:31.041
AND RESTS HER VOICE,

10:28.834 --> 10:31.041
HER RECOVERY WILL

10:31.083 --> 10:33.041
BE SWIFT AND PAINLESS.

10:33.083 --> 10:33.875
-I'M SORRY.

10:33.917 --> 10:35.625
I'M SORRY.

10:35.667 --> 10:39.500
I KNEW THIS WAS COMING, BUT

10:35.667 --> 10:39.500
NOTHING REALLY PREPARES YOU.

10:39.542 --> 10:43.709
-SAMSON, SHE'S GOING

10:39.542 --> 10:43.709
TO BE FINE.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.250
-SPOKEN LIKE A GUY WHO HAS ALL

10:43.750 --> 10:46.250
THE TIME IN THE WORLD.

10:52.125 --> 10:57.125
-BLUE 16, BLUE 16.

10:52.125 --> 10:57.125
HUT, HUT.

11:05.667 --> 11:06.917
-NAMASTE.

11:17.792 --> 11:18.583
-WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

11:18.625 --> 11:19.959
HIT ME.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.125
-KIND WORDS ARE STRONGER THAN

11:20.000 --> 11:24.125
TACKLES, SO NAMASTE.

11:24.166 --> 11:25.458
-STOP SAYING THAT.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.250
WHAT-- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW

11:25.500 --> 11:27.250
WHAT THAT MEANS, DO YOU?

11:27.291 --> 11:28.375
USE IT IN A SENTENCE.

11:28.417 --> 11:30.709
-NAMASTE IS A SENTENCE.

11:30.750 --> 11:31.625
NAMASTE--

11:31.667 --> 11:33.041
-GOD, STOP SAYING NAMASTE.

11:33.083 --> 11:36.709
YOU SAY NAMASTE ONE MORE TIME

11:33.083 --> 11:36.709
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.000
-NAMASTE.

11:40.250 --> 11:43.000
THE ONLY WAY TO GROW IS THROUGH

11:40.250 --> 11:43.000
FACING OUR FEARS.

11:51.291 --> 11:52.750
-SO WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,

11:51.291 --> 11:52.750
MORAN?

11:52.792 --> 11:53.792
-WHAT'S MY PROBLEM?

11:53.834 --> 11:56.208
THE WHOLE TEAM IS

11:53.834 --> 11:56.208
FALLING APART.

11:56.250 --> 11:59.333
THAD'S GONE, AND, AND I

11:56.250 --> 11:59.333
HOLD TEAM MEETINGS AND

11:59.375 --> 12:00.834
NO ONE SHOWS UP.

12:00.875 --> 12:03.041
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY LIKE TRYING TO

12:00.875 --> 12:03.041
GET THAD BACK AND THE TEAM

12:03.083 --> 12:05.125
BACK TOGETHER THAT I HAVEN'T

12:03.083 --> 12:05.125
HAD A BEER OR

12:05.166 --> 12:06.417
SEX IN THREE DAYS.

12:09.166 --> 12:11.291
-I GAVE YOU EVERYTHING.

12:11.333 --> 12:14.000
I GAVE YOU THE KEYS TO

12:11.333 --> 12:14.000
THE FERRARI, AND WHAT

12:14.041 --> 12:15.208
DID I GET IN RETURN?

12:15.250 --> 12:16.458
AND O AND ONE RECORD.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.291
-I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT

12:16.500 --> 12:18.291
THAT AND YOU THREW

12:18.333 --> 12:19.542
IT IN MY FACE ANYWAY.

12:19.583 --> 12:21.333
-HEY, YOU DON'T LIKE THE

12:19.583 --> 12:21.333
WAY THINGS ARE GOING

12:21.375 --> 12:22.834
DON'T WHINE ABOUT IT.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.709
I MEAN THEY DON'T SHOW UP TO

12:22.875 --> 12:24.709
YOUR MEETINGS YOU DON'T CRY.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.458
YOU GO KICK DOWN THEIR DOOR,

12:24.750 --> 12:27.458
DRAG THEM BY THE BALLS, AND

12:27.500 --> 12:28.583
BRING THEM TO THE MEETING.

12:28.625 --> 12:29.875
THAT'S WHY YOU ARE

12:28.625 --> 12:29.875
THE CAPTAIN.

12:29.917 --> 12:33.208
-I HATE LOSING.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.041
-YOU KNOW, I WISH YOU HAD

12:33.250 --> 12:36.041
THAT FIRE ON SATURDAY.

12:36.083 --> 12:39.125
MAYBE WE WOULD HAVE WON.

12:39.166 --> 12:40.959
NOW GET THE HELL OUT

12:39.166 --> 12:40.959
OF MY OFFICE.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.500
AND DON'T COME BACK UNTIL YOU

12:41.000 --> 12:43.500
HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW ME.

12:43.542 --> 12:44.667
-YOU, YOU CAN'T KICK ME OUT.

12:44.709 --> 12:45.667
I'M LEAVING.

12:45.709 --> 12:47.500
-I'M KICKING YOU OUT.

12:47.542 --> 12:48.333
-I'M LEAVING.

12:48.375 --> 12:49.166
-SLAM THE DOOR BEHIND YOU.

12:49.208 --> 12:50.208
-I WILL.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.250
-I LOVE YOU.

12:59.291 --> 13:00.417

14:33.083 --> 14:37.500
WE LOSE ONE GAME, AND WE GIVE

14:33.083 --> 14:37.500
UP ON AN ENTIRE SEASON?

14:37.542 --> 14:39.083
I'M EMBARRASSED.

14:39.125 --> 14:41.583
I AM EMBARRASSED BY THE WAY

14:39.125 --> 14:41.583
WE'VE BEEN PLAYING, BUT I'M

14:41.625 --> 14:44.917
MORE EMBARRASSED BY THE WAY

14:41.625 --> 14:44.917
WE'VE BEEN PARTYING.

NO MORE EXCUSES.

14:47.500 --> 14:51.000
THIS IS THE WEEK THAT WE PUT OUR

14:54.500 --> 14:59.333
THE BIGGEST PARTY THIS SCHOOL

15:00.834 --> 15:02.125
-BUT THE LAST PARTY SUCKED.

15:02.166 --> 15:03.917
-YOU LET IT SUCK.

15:03.959 --> 15:07.625
YOU ABANDONED YOUR TEAM TO GO

15:03.959 --> 15:07.625
PARTY WITH THE TENNIS TEAM?

15:07.667 --> 15:08.625

YOU WILL BE AT THIS PARTY AND

15:14.375 --> 15:17.375
YOU WILL PARTY YOUR ASSES OFF

15:17.417 --> 15:20.333
I AM NOT WASTING

15:20.375 --> 15:24.667
ANOTHER WEEK OF MY COLLEGE

15:20.375 --> 15:24.667
LIFE NOT ENJOYING MYSELF.

15:24.709 --> 15:27.667
COLLEGE LIFE IS TOO SHORT.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.333
IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

15:29.375 --> 15:31.417
-YEAH.

HARMON, GET THE DRUGS.

15:41.083 --> 15:43.166

I DON'T WANT YOU USING

15:44.333 --> 15:45.750

17:10.083 --> 17:13.709
I WOULD LIKE THE PEACEFULNESS

17:10.083 --> 17:13.709
OF MY HOUSE BACK.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.792
-THIS IS NOT YOUR HOUSE

17:13.750 --> 17:16.792
ANY MORE, BRO AMIGO.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.875
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

17:18.917 --> 17:22.375

17:53.458 --> 17:55.083
-WE NEED TO TALK.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.333
-ACTUALLY WE DON'T.

17:57.375 --> 18:01.959
-I AM STILL CAPTAIN OF THIS

17:57.375 --> 18:01.959
TEAM, AND I DESERVE RESPECT.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.458
-YOU'RE NOT CAPTAIN.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.208
I AM.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.166
YOU'RE NOTHING.

18:06.208 --> 18:09.208
YOU'RE A ZIT ON MY

18:06.208 --> 18:09.208
ASS, CASTLE.

18:20.208 --> 18:22.041
-HMM?

18:22.083 --> 18:23.333
-I'M FACING MY FEARS.

18:27.166 --> 18:28.417
NAMASTE.

18:31.417 --> 18:32.917
-FACING YOUR FEARS?

18:32.959 --> 18:34.291
CUT THE BULLSHIT.
