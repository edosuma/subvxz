00:33.390 --> 00:35.358
100 candles.

00:35.391 --> 00:38.358
100 ghost stories.

00:38.391 --> 00:41.991
And a mirror in the dark
to summon the spirits.

00:43.390 --> 00:46.957
The procedure is simple,
but absolutely terrifying.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.956
You must sit by
the other players

00:49.989 --> 00:53.324
in a circle made of 100 candles.

00:53.356 --> 00:56.423
You take a candle and
tell a horror story.

00:56.456 --> 01:00.391
Then you go over to the
next room with the candle

01:00.423 --> 01:03.923
and stay there, alone
with the mirror.

01:03.957 --> 01:07.423
You blow out the candle
and if you're lucky,

01:07.456 --> 01:12.024
you'll only see the overwhelming
darkness before you.

01:12.057 --> 01:14.557
But if you're not lucky,

01:14.590 --> 01:17.358
that could be the
last thing you see

01:17.391 --> 01:21.991
before your mind get lost in
the dark mazes of insanity.

01:23.956 --> 01:28.390
As stories are told and
candles get blown out,

01:28.423 --> 01:32.391
a portal will start to
open through the mirror.

01:32.423 --> 01:36.091
You will feel strange
presences around you,

01:36.123 --> 01:37.957
lurking in the shadows.

01:39.123 --> 01:42.957
But you must not leave the game,

01:42.990 --> 01:46.990
or else a terrible curse
will fall upon you.

01:53.090 --> 01:57.857
"Legend has it the game came
from Japan many centuries ago.

01:59.290 --> 02:02.856
The old samurai told each
other terrifying stories

02:02.890 --> 02:05.491
to prove themselves
their bravery.

02:06.423 --> 02:10.455
They say one night a
samurai played this game

02:10.490 --> 02:12.457
with his wife and children.

02:13.256 --> 02:17.990
After many hours, they
got to story number 100,

02:19.191 --> 02:22.158
and then something
horrible happened.

02:23.489 --> 02:28.123
The warrior's wife kill
herself before the mirror,

02:28.157 --> 02:31.457
cutting her throat
with a piece of glass.

02:32.291 --> 02:36.924
Desperate in pain, the
samurai did the same,

02:36.957 --> 02:39.957
to join his wife
in the afterlife."

02:42.323 --> 02:47.024
Even today, whenever you
light a mirror in the dark,

02:47.056 --> 02:51.990
you can see their shadows.

02:53.389 --> 02:56.456
The game of the 100 candles

02:56.490 --> 02:58.357
has just begun.

03:32.355 --> 03:33.190
So?

03:36.056 --> 03:37.489
No, I didn't see anything.

03:37.523 --> 03:39.024
We were getting worried.

03:39.057 --> 03:41.791
Let's go on. Sooner or
later, we'll see something.

03:41.823 --> 03:44.856
Don't be idiots.
Nothing will happen.

03:44.890 --> 03:45.991
Who's next?

03:46.024 --> 03:47.258
It's Kristy's turn.

03:47.290 --> 03:48.923
No, no, wait. We
already had a girl.

03:48.957 --> 03:50.224
You're up, Alex.

03:50.256 --> 03:52.056
Fine! I have loads
of stories to tell.

03:52.090 --> 03:53.524
I hope you don't tell
the one where you got drunk

03:53.556 --> 03:55.923
and ended up in bed with
your girlfriend's mom.

03:55.957 --> 03:58.258
Now, that! That
was a horror story!

03:58.289 --> 03:59.357
Right, it was a long time ago.

03:59.389 --> 04:01.923
There was a lot of alcohol
involved, I was cold...

04:01.957 --> 04:03.224
You know what? It
doesn't matter.

04:03.257 --> 04:05.024
Right, right.

04:05.056 --> 04:07.956
This is the story
I'm gonna tell.

04:07.989 --> 04:11.124
This is a story
about a little girl.

04:11.157 --> 04:14.390
She was scared and all
alone in the woods.

04:14.422 --> 04:17.991
She ran and she ran amongst
the trees and the bushes,

04:18.023 --> 04:21.289
until she ran into
something unexpected.

05:11.124 --> 05:12.323
Hi?

05:17.890 --> 05:18.824
Hey.

05:21.024 --> 05:22.357
Are you alone?

05:27.057 --> 05:28.490
You wanna play?

05:30.823 --> 05:31.757
Okay.

06:04.557 --> 06:06.758
What are you doing here?

06:08.190 --> 06:09.791
Nothing.

06:37.190 --> 06:38.091
You know what?

06:38.956 --> 06:39.890
What?

06:41.422 --> 06:43.123
I saw something in the woods.

06:46.455 --> 06:47.923
There's a witch out there.

06:50.889 --> 06:53.058
She snatches kids
and feeds on them.

06:54.123 --> 06:55.157
How do you know?

06:56.357 --> 07:00.090
Everyone knows about the
forest and the people missing.

07:01.890 --> 07:03.890
Why do you think
they feed on children?

07:05.057 --> 07:07.557
They like their taste.

07:07.589 --> 07:08.423
Their taste?

07:11.522 --> 07:13.956
Can I ask you something?

07:13.989 --> 07:15.489
Sure.

07:20.422 --> 07:22.523
How do you taste,
little bitch?

07:46.924 --> 07:47.991
You're late.

07:50.055 --> 07:51.322
Sorry, darling.

07:51.355 --> 07:52.189
Needed to be sure.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.924
I don't like to be the bait.

08:08.957 --> 08:11.924
What do you think a
witch tastes like?

09:07.423 --> 09:08.856
What the hell
are you doin' in there?

09:08.889 --> 09:09.989
You jerkin' off or somethin'?

09:14.223 --> 09:15.057
Okay.

09:36.190 --> 09:38.990
- It's my turn, right?
- Yeah, it's your turn.

09:39.022 --> 09:40.990
Hope you don't
take as long as Alex.

09:41.023 --> 09:43.089
Come on, I
didn't take that long.

09:44.857 --> 09:49.490
So, I know this story
that took place a while ago,

09:49.523 --> 09:51.257
in my hometown.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.089
Come with me.

10:54.190 --> 10:55.857
You know who did this.

10:56.557 --> 10:57.856
Right?

10:57.889 --> 10:59.322
The gorgers.

10:59.355 --> 11:00.523
They lurk everywhere.

11:01.823 --> 11:04.056
In the fields, in the woods,

11:04.089 --> 11:07.056
and if you go outside, you
put both of us in danger.

11:07.088 --> 11:08.022
You understand?

11:10.122 --> 11:11.089
If they find you...

11:25.289 --> 11:26.157
I'm sorry.

11:40.122 --> 11:42.189
I know you have
never been outside.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.389
But it's cruel out there.

11:47.422 --> 11:49.323
It's dangerous.

11:49.356 --> 11:51.057
We have to stick together.

11:52.123 --> 11:53.022
You and me.

11:55.989 --> 11:59.390
You don't want me to
lose you, son, do you?

12:52.323 --> 12:54.157
What happened?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.157
- Did you see something?
- Mm-hm.

12:56.189 --> 12:57.189
At the barn.

13:31.557 --> 13:34.223
Do you think they've smelt me?

13:45.989 --> 13:47.523
Did you see the fog outside?

13:51.123 --> 13:53.524
Hanging above the
field. It's them.

13:53.556 --> 13:55.223
The scent of little children.

13:56.557 --> 13:57.424
It attracts them.

13:58.889 --> 13:59.990
It's in your clothes.

14:01.855 --> 14:02.490
In your hair.

14:04.289 --> 14:06.190
They used to be
called the fog demons,

14:06.223 --> 14:08.890
because they move with the fog.

14:19.889 --> 14:21.823
You have your mother's eyes.

14:31.823 --> 14:34.257
I'm gonna go and feed the pigs.

14:41.356 --> 14:43.057
Yeah, that's good.

14:47.390 --> 14:49.124
That's a good spot.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.456
I wanna show you somethin'.

14:53.490 --> 14:55.056
Why don't you get the lights?

15:01.356 --> 15:02.289
Now watch.

15:18.355 --> 15:20.290
That's our little world.

15:26.155 --> 15:28.123
Can you read this to me?

15:29.823 --> 15:30.457
Again?

15:33.823 --> 15:34.457
All right.

15:48.555 --> 15:49.424
You stay here.

17:23.255 --> 17:26.356
Should I die before I wake,

17:26.388 --> 17:27.388
I do not cry,

17:28.454 --> 17:30.223
I do not ache.

17:30.256 --> 17:33.022
Nothing's ever mine to keep.

17:33.055 --> 17:35.522
I close my eyes and go to sleep.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.790
And pray the Lord
my soul to take.

17:40.822 --> 17:43.224
Should I die before I wake...

20:33.223 --> 20:35.356
What the hell
are you doing here?

21:10.589 --> 21:11.790
They're here.

21:12.822 --> 21:17.823
You know what to do!

21:18.288 --> 21:19.190
Run!

22:03.122 --> 22:05.789
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

24:47.822 --> 24:50.488
We have the boy.

24:51.855 --> 24:52.922
Go, go, go!

24:55.955 --> 24:58.021
Suspect down, weapon secured.

24:58.055 --> 24:59.556
Copy that.

24:59.588 --> 25:00.489
We've got control.

25:01.956 --> 25:02.957
Suspect is down.

25:04.121 --> 25:06.756
You're good now. You're safe.

25:46.412 --> 25:47.382
Hey.

25:56.647 --> 25:57.614
My dear son.

26:46.947 --> 26:47.947
Mom?

26:51.280 --> 26:52.681
Mom, are you there?

26:58.379 --> 26:59.313
I miss you.

27:09.413 --> 27:10.646
This stupid game.

27:10.680 --> 27:14.447
Stupid Kristy, what the
hell are you doing here?

27:36.280 --> 27:37.646
Hey, kitty.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.781
Hey! How are you?

27:40.846 --> 27:42.514
What you doin' here?

28:13.879 --> 28:15.781
Kristy!

28:15.813 --> 28:17.580
Kristy. Kristy, what's going on?

28:17.614 --> 28:19.314
- Hey, hey.
- My face.

28:19.346 --> 28:21.948
There's something wrong with
my face. I can't get it off.

28:21.980 --> 28:24.215
I can't get it off,
I can't get it off!

28:24.246 --> 28:25.746
What are you talking about?

28:25.780 --> 28:26.981
There's nothing
wrong with your face.

28:27.013 --> 28:29.546
Are you guys lying?
I'm a freaking monster!

28:29.580 --> 28:30.881
Look in the mirror!

28:34.480 --> 28:38.447
I... I thought there
something on my face.

28:38.479 --> 28:39.814
It's the game, Kristy.

28:40.479 --> 28:42.880
You see things that aren't real.

28:43.981 --> 28:44.814
You're fine.

28:46.512 --> 28:47.547
Let's move on.

28:58.613 --> 29:01.581
Let's go
drink some water.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.279
Children with black eyes.

29:34.313 --> 29:38.547
I first heard about the legend
a long time ago in the '80s.

29:38.580 --> 29:40.714
Dude, you're not
that old. Come on.

29:40.746 --> 29:44.379
I am, actually. I'm as
old as humanity itself.

29:44.413 --> 29:48.714
I keep myself young with
virgin women's blood.

29:53.446 --> 29:55.846
I can tell you don't
need to worry about that.

29:55.880 --> 29:57.647
Fuck you, James.

29:57.679 --> 30:01.246
Anyway, children
with black eyes.

30:01.280 --> 30:04.681
They say they are demons
disguised as youngsters.

30:04.713 --> 30:09.379
You can see them hitchhiking
or asking for change.

30:09.413 --> 30:11.581
You can find them when
you least expect it.

30:11.614 --> 30:15.514
In your front yard, or
in even worse places.

30:15.546 --> 30:18.446

I found you!

39:29.813 --> 39:31.279
Are you crazy? You
could've hit me on the head.

39:31.312 --> 39:32.779
What the fuck are you
talking about, James?

39:32.812 --> 39:35.280
Is this shit supposed
to scare me or something?

39:38.746 --> 39:40.279
A flyer from a camp?

39:40.312 --> 39:43.380
- What?
- It's a flyer from a camp.

39:43.412 --> 39:45.846
No, I swear. Someone
threw a brick at me.

39:45.878 --> 39:47.513
There was a note attached to it

39:47.545 --> 39:50.279
and it said "leave
or we will kill you."

39:50.313 --> 39:53.281
I told you, this is
not just a game, James.

39:54.146 --> 39:55.679
I don't know
what the fuck happened.

39:58.878 --> 40:00.314
We can't quit the game now.

40:01.479 --> 40:03.280
We have to go on
with the stories.

40:04.745 --> 40:06.646
It's your turn, Alex.

40:06.678 --> 40:08.513
Yes, I know.

40:08.546 --> 40:10.280
I thought about this,

40:10.313 --> 40:13.480
this story I heard
when I was at school.

40:13.513 --> 40:15.647
It was about these little girls,

40:16.646 --> 40:18.747
and they had this perfect life.

40:19.913 --> 40:25.314
But one night, something very,
very eerie happened to them.

41:00.845 --> 41:01.679
Honey.

41:03.612 --> 41:05.913
Why are you in the bed?

41:08.012 --> 41:11.346
Jill, did
you wet the bed?

41:12.645 --> 41:14.379
God.

41:19.347 --> 41:21.314
Oh, my god!

41:21.347 --> 41:23.314
Oh, my god, honey!
What happened?

41:23.347 --> 41:24.580
What happened, Jill?

41:24.613 --> 41:26.247
Was there somebody
here? Talk to me.

41:28.347 --> 41:29.281
Katie.

42:47.812 --> 42:48.712
Oh, my god.

42:50.478 --> 42:51.745
Katie.

42:52.912 --> 42:54.412
Katie.

42:54.445 --> 42:56.779
Katie.

44:13.612 --> 44:14.479
Mom?

44:15.746 --> 44:17.480
What are you doing?

44:18.511 --> 44:19.380
Huh?

44:20.946 --> 44:22.513
What happened to the hallway?

44:31.511 --> 44:32.345
Oh, no.

44:34.246 --> 44:35.679
You're doing it again.

44:41.412 --> 44:42.479
Open up!

44:42.511 --> 44:44.879
Open the door!

44:45.713 --> 44:46.512
Now!

44:46.545 --> 44:47.546
It's your mother!

44:47.578 --> 44:49.680
Open the door!

44:49.712 --> 44:52.445
Open the door, now!

44:52.479 --> 44:54.479
Put your hand on the
door and unlock it!

44:54.511 --> 44:55.512
It's your mother!

44:57.713 --> 44:58.846
Please!

44:58.879 --> 44:59.780
Let me in!

45:27.578 --> 45:29.712
Oh, god.

45:29.745 --> 45:31.478
Get out of there!

45:31.511 --> 45:32.612
You're in danger!

45:39.512 --> 45:40.713
My baby.

45:40.746 --> 45:41.747
Oh, my baby.

46:24.612 --> 46:26.212
Kristy! Kristy, Kristy!

46:26.246 --> 46:27.580
What's wrong?
Kristy, what's wrong?

46:27.612 --> 46:29.413
There's someone
here. We're not alone.

46:29.445 --> 46:30.580
There's someone here.

46:30.613 --> 46:31.579
What? There's nobody here.

46:31.612 --> 46:33.579
I saw her. She was there.

46:33.612 --> 46:35.612
There was this woman with
her face all eaten up,

46:35.646 --> 46:38.580
and she was, she
was holding a cat.

46:38.612 --> 46:39.579
She was there.

46:39.613 --> 46:41.346
Kristy, it's the game.

46:41.379 --> 46:43.846
They're spirits. They can't
really harm you, it's fine.

46:43.879 --> 46:47.580
I saw her! I'm not
making this up, I'm not!

46:47.612 --> 46:49.612
You should
blow out the candle.

46:49.645 --> 46:50.579
What?

46:50.613 --> 46:52.479
You have to blow it out.

46:52.511 --> 46:54.412
Otherwise, we can't
go on with the game.

46:54.446 --> 46:56.779
I don't want anything to
do with this fucking game!

46:56.813 --> 46:58.646
I want to go home!

46:58.679 --> 47:00.346
Remember, we
all agreed to this.

47:00.378 --> 47:02.579
- We need to finish the game.
- Well, I was out of my mind!

47:02.612 --> 47:04.378
I didn't know it was
going to be like this.

47:04.412 --> 47:06.546
I know, Kristy, but the
sooner we finish the game,

47:06.579 --> 47:09.246
the sooner we go home, just
blow the candle, please.

47:09.279 --> 47:10.812
Just do it.

47:22.412 --> 47:24.713
Let's get outta here.

48:08.678 --> 48:10.312
All right.

48:10.346 --> 48:11.647
I'll go on with this shit.

48:12.879 --> 48:17.812
I read this story online
recently about these two friends.

48:17.845 --> 48:19.546
Natasha and Nina.

48:19.578 --> 48:20.780
Now, there was some snapshots

48:20.813 --> 48:22.914
of a conversation
between the two of them.

48:24.278 --> 48:27.512
And one day, Natasha
wakes up in the dark,

48:28.712 --> 48:31.546
and doesn't know what
the hell is going on.

49:03.292 --> 49:04.458
Where am I?

49:06.333 --> 49:07.333
Hello?

49:21.833 --> 49:22.833
Hello?

49:25.083 --> 49:26.542

51:36.458 --> 51:39.542
Nina, I don't remember
what happened.

51:45.167 --> 51:48.042

No, that's impossible.
It can't be you.

No, no, no!

53:29.000 --> 53:31.417
I swear I'm alive,
please help me.

53:31.500 --> 53:33.542
Please tell my parents.

53:34.250 --> 53:35.375
I don't believe you.

53:35.500 --> 53:37.875
If you're really Natasha,
you'll know the answer to this:

53:38.667 --> 53:40.167
What grade did you get
in the biology class?

53:40.792 --> 53:43.708
Fuck you, Nina!
Don't you recognize my voice?

53:44.292 --> 53:45.458
Come on, answer the question.

53:45.583 --> 53:50.333
I have no idea, this is a trick question,
the grades haven't been given yet.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
What was the last movie
we watched together?

53:53.083 --> 53:55.583
Don't ask me stupid questions!

53:55.708 --> 53:59.750
If you're really Natasha, you must know
which movie we last watched together.

53:59.875 --> 54:02.458
I don't know, Nina! It was...

54:02.708 --> 54:05.708
It was "Diary of a Passion",
and we cried at the end.

54:08.833 --> 54:12.500

54:14.958 --> 54:17.417
Natasha? No, it can't be you.

This is impossible. Where are you?

54:20.917 --> 54:23.792
Nina, I'm in a coffin,
I don't know how I got here.

54:23.875 --> 54:26.042
I don't understand this,
I can't move.

54:27.708 --> 54:29.042
Help me!

54:29.167 --> 54:31.167
I don't get it,
must be one of those incidents

54:31.292 --> 54:32.875
where people get buried alive.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.875
Nina, that stuff
doesn't happen anymore.

54:35.375 --> 54:37.375
My God, Natasha!

54:37.542 --> 54:39.292
I'll call your parents.

54:39.375 --> 54:40.500
Nina, wait.

54:40.750 --> 54:42.583
Don't leave me alone, Nina.

54:48.012 --> 54:52.346
No!

55:01.500 --> 55:04.583
I can't believe
this is happening to you.

55:04.917 --> 55:07.708
Stay calm, I've already
told your parents everything.

55:07.833 --> 55:10.417
They've already spoken to the police
and they're coming there to the cemetery.

55:10.542 --> 55:14.875
Stay calm and stop talking,
otherwise you'll run out of air.

55:15.750 --> 55:17.917
Thanks you, Nina. Thank you.

55:18.500 --> 55:20.750
Tell them to come quickly,
I'm suffocating.

55:49.012 --> 55:49.846
Nina.

please tell them to hurry up!

56:43.667 --> 56:45.083
This isn't funny.

56:45.458 --> 56:46.708
Is this a joke?

56:49.875 --> 56:51.583
Come on, stop it.

56:55.583 --> 56:57.417
No one's coming to help you.

56:58.500 --> 57:01.833
I'm just distracting you
from asking for more help.

57:02.125 --> 57:05.708
Nina, what are you saying?
I'm running out of air.

57:08.333 --> 57:11.708
I gave you the poison
that left you catatonic.

57:12.312 --> 57:14.511
No, no, no, no, no!

57:14.542 --> 57:17.167
I also left a cellphone
without any credit there,

57:17.250 --> 57:20.167
- it only had me as a contact.
- Nina, no! Please!

57:20.292 --> 57:23.250
I also left you a pet
to keep you company

57:23.375 --> 57:24.708
to make the point of leaving you.

57:25.583 --> 57:27.875
Why, motherfucker?
What did I do to you?

57:28.000 --> 57:29.417
You still don't know?

57:29.625 --> 57:32.708
Don't you remember, bitch,
your date with Damian?

57:34.458 --> 57:37.125
No, Nina.
What do you mean? That's not true.

57:37.414 --> 57:40.679
No, no, no, no, no, no.

57:45.708 --> 57:46.875
Hello, dear.

57:47.583 --> 57:49.000
I loved yesterday.

57:49.583 --> 57:53.250
I didn't think you'd be so hot.

57:53.375 --> 57:54.625
Hello, beautiful.

57:55.250 --> 57:56.458
Look who's talking.

57:56.556 --> 57:58.245
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

57:59.875 --> 58:01.458
"I feel a bit guilty about Nina,

58:02.333 --> 58:03.958
but I can't resist.

58:04.250 --> 58:05.667
I wish I could just hide...

58:05.723 --> 58:06.413
Nina, no!

58:07.125 --> 58:09.417
and never let you go again."
I loved him.

58:09.750 --> 58:11.167
Goodbye, Natasha.

58:11.417 --> 58:13.208
I hope you enjoy your hiding place

58:13.292 --> 58:15.046
- with rats and worms.
- No, no, no, no, no.

58:15.156 --> 58:18.917
Oh, and with Damian,
who mustn't be far from you.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.333
Get me out of here!

58:21.378 --> 58:23.380
No, no, no, no, no, no!

59:55.410 --> 59:56.945
That's it, I'm out.
This is totally stupid.

59:56.978 --> 59:58.411
Wait. James, what's wrong?

59:58.445 --> 01:00:00.679
Nothin'. Fuck the
rules of this game.

01:00:00.711 --> 01:00:02.245
I'm fuckin' outta
here, all right?

01:00:02.279 --> 01:00:04.279
What happened?

01:00:04.312 --> 01:00:05.844
Where are the cell phones?

01:00:05.877 --> 01:00:09.377
It's just a game.
It's okay to be scared.

01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:11.579
Fuck you, all right?
Fuck you, fuck this game.

01:00:11.612 --> 01:00:12.911
You got us into
this fuckin' mess.

01:00:12.944 --> 01:00:15.411
Don't blame her, we
all agreed to this!

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.246
Stop blaming her!

01:00:17.279 --> 01:00:19.478
All right, yeah. You shut
the fuck up, all right?

01:00:19.511 --> 01:00:20.946
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

01:00:20.978 --> 01:00:23.245
Stop! Just stop!

01:00:27.878 --> 01:00:30.378
Okay, if you
wanna go, then fuckin' go!

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:34.245
But you're responsible
for what happens to us.

01:00:40.478 --> 01:00:42.445
Okay, let's move on.

01:00:42.477 --> 01:00:43.946
But you're up, Alex.

01:00:45.777 --> 01:00:46.578
Okay.

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:52.946
I thought of this story
that I read in the paper,

01:00:52.978 --> 01:00:55.278
back in my hometown.

01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:56.945
It was about this priest.

01:00:58.311 --> 01:00:59.445
I don't remember
the year exactly.

01:00:59.477 --> 01:01:01.411
The year's not
important, okay?

01:01:01.444 --> 01:01:03.477
Just tell the story already.

01:01:03.511 --> 01:01:04.578
All right.

01:01:04.611 --> 01:01:08.844
The priest was new in town
and there was this girl,

01:01:08.877 --> 01:01:10.478
and she was pregnant.

01:01:12.645 --> 01:01:16.846
But there was something
very wrong about her.

01:02:17.678 --> 01:02:18.546
Simpleton.

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:23.945
Can you tell me where I
can find the Bracken home?

01:02:26.978 --> 01:02:28.578
Second cottage up the isle.

01:02:31.944 --> 01:02:32.779
Thank you.

01:03:04.277 --> 01:03:05.579
My name is Father Carey.

01:03:06.578 --> 01:03:07.845
Where's Father Andrews?

01:03:08.944 --> 01:03:09.745
Delayed.

01:03:11.345 --> 01:03:12.778
He sends his apologies.

01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:14.711
Come out
of the way, pastor.

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.611
Mrs. Bracken?

01:03:52.878 --> 01:03:54.345
You have traveled far.

01:03:56.410 --> 01:03:57.745
You'll have a whiskey?

01:03:59.311 --> 01:04:00.645
I'd prefer to get started.

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:43.678
Father.

01:04:44.645 --> 01:04:45.579
Stop.

01:04:53.677 --> 01:04:55.779
Am I going to die, Father?

01:04:58.678 --> 01:04:59.612
No, my child.

01:05:00.712 --> 01:05:01.678
Of course not.

01:05:05.745 --> 01:05:09.645
It wants to.

01:05:17.577 --> 01:05:19.679
Our Father who art in heaven.

01:05:19.711 --> 01:05:22.344
Please, Father!

01:05:30.711 --> 01:05:32.412
She's swallowed her tongue.

01:05:32.445 --> 01:05:34.678
Come here!

01:05:34.711 --> 01:05:36.744
Hold her mouth open!

01:05:53.011 --> 01:05:55.711
Help me!

01:06:26.744 --> 01:06:28.344
How long has she been this way?

01:06:32.678 --> 01:06:34.746
The nightmares
started weeks back.

01:06:36.844 --> 01:06:38.945
Then she'd see things.

01:06:41.278 --> 01:06:43.779
Now she said she hears voices.

01:06:43.812 --> 01:06:44.845
Who's the father?

01:06:47.777 --> 01:06:48.778
She won't say.

01:06:59.778 --> 01:07:00.779
You can help us?

01:07:03.778 --> 01:07:05.645
The demon could
kill them both.

01:07:10.245 --> 01:07:12.779
And I don't know
if I can stop it.

01:07:23.877 --> 01:07:25.379
Do whatever you have to.

01:07:36.812 --> 01:07:37.812
Check the binds.

01:07:54.812 --> 01:07:55.646
Jesus!

01:07:57.876 --> 01:07:58.811
Leave.

01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:02.377
Get out!

01:08:41.544 --> 01:08:43.444
Blessed
art thou amongst women,

01:08:43.478 --> 01:08:46.944
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

01:08:47.876 --> 01:08:49.611
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

01:09:12.344 --> 01:09:13.877
You can't stop it!

01:09:14.876 --> 01:09:15.977
Fraud!

01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:34.912
I'll smite them all.

01:10:00.311 --> 01:10:01.477
God forgive me!

01:10:02.578 --> 01:10:04.778
Don't! You'll damn us all!

01:11:17.344 --> 01:11:18.178
Mommy.

01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:21.178
It hurts.

01:11:25.977 --> 01:11:28.244
Push!

01:11:28.278 --> 01:11:30.245
Push, Maebh, push!

01:11:34.277 --> 01:11:35.411
One more!

01:11:50.011 --> 01:11:51.212
It's a boy.

01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:20.512
Tell me, who will
care for the child?

01:12:22.245 --> 01:12:24.279
Father Andrews said
he'd find a good home.

01:12:25.544 --> 01:12:27.478
The sooner the better.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.877
It would be cruel to let
mother and child bond.

01:12:32.677 --> 01:12:34.278
Take the child.

01:12:37.245 --> 01:12:37.945
Take him with you.

01:12:51.877 --> 01:12:52.678
Father.

01:12:54.811 --> 01:12:57.743
Peace and good health to you.

01:12:57.777 --> 01:12:58.778
And also with you.

01:13:10.444 --> 01:13:11.945
I need you to take us across.

01:13:37.611 --> 01:13:38.978
I release you.

01:13:59.711 --> 01:14:00.678
Jesus.

01:14:20.011 --> 01:14:23.312
It's Father
Andrews. I have Father Carey.

01:14:23.344 --> 01:14:24.677
We're here to help...

01:14:47.776 --> 01:14:49.379
Do you know who this is?

01:14:52.577 --> 01:14:55.278
You don't know how long
I've been waiting for you.

01:14:57.644 --> 01:14:58.478
My little prince.

01:15:11.377 --> 01:15:12.644
Something's wrong.

01:15:13.578 --> 01:15:16.411
- I'll go get him.
- No, you can't go in.

01:15:16.443 --> 01:15:19.345
You have to wait for him to
come back. That's the rules.

01:15:19.377 --> 01:15:22.643
Fuck your shitty
rules. I'm gonna go get him.

01:15:22.677 --> 01:15:23.511
Fuck.

01:15:51.978 --> 01:15:53.377
He's not here.

01:15:53.409 --> 01:15:55.944
Are you sure?

01:15:55.978 --> 01:15:57.411
Searched all the rooms.

01:16:00.443 --> 01:16:02.410
We have to keep
on playing the game.

01:16:03.409 --> 01:16:04.710
Are you insane?

01:16:04.743 --> 01:16:06.578
Alex is gone.

01:16:06.611 --> 01:16:07.444
Gone!

01:16:08.577 --> 01:16:11.377
Erica was right.
She was always right.

01:16:11.409 --> 01:16:13.911
Once you start playing
the game, you can't stop.

01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:23.478
Okay, here it goes.

01:16:27.278 --> 01:16:28.811
This is a story about a girl.

01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:34.444
This girl, she moves
into an apartment.

01:16:35.543 --> 01:16:37.410
She thought she
was sleeping alone,

01:16:38.811 --> 01:16:40.212
but then she realized,

01:16:42.744 --> 01:16:43.745
she wasn't.

01:18:10.636 --> 01:18:13.570
It seems nice. I
wish you could see the view.

01:18:16.236 --> 01:18:18.869
No, I managed to get
it all up here myself.

01:18:20.435 --> 01:18:22.436
Yeah, I'm just
finishing it up now.

01:18:24.934 --> 01:18:26.935
Okay. Miss you too.

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:27.803
Bye.

01:19:25.436 --> 01:19:30.169
What?

01:19:30.202 --> 01:19:33.036
You need somethin'?

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:36.002
Sorry, I was just
looking for Adam.

01:19:37.201 --> 01:19:39.036
Adam left about
three days ago.

01:19:43.034 --> 01:19:44.202
Should be back next week.

01:19:47.201 --> 01:19:50.068
No one else around
here would have, like,

01:19:50.102 --> 01:19:52.003
a master key, would they?

01:19:53.501 --> 01:19:55.402
Not so far as I know.

01:19:58.301 --> 01:19:59.503
Is everything all right?

01:20:02.235 --> 01:20:03.869
Yeah, it's...

01:20:03.901 --> 01:20:05.202
It's fine.

01:20:05.235 --> 01:20:06.235
Thanks for your help.

01:28:53.567 --> 01:28:55.267
I didn't see anything.

01:28:55.301 --> 01:28:56.836
You didn't see Alex either?

01:28:58.869 --> 01:29:00.435
Erica?

01:29:00.467 --> 01:29:03.202
Tell the last story so we
can get the fuck out of here.

01:29:04.169 --> 01:29:05.468
We don't know that.

01:29:05.501 --> 01:29:07.203
We don't know what?

01:29:07.235 --> 01:29:08.435
If this shit will end.

01:29:09.868 --> 01:29:12.135
Well, it has to
'cause Erica said so!

01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:13.602
Erica?

01:29:13.634 --> 01:29:16.268
Tell your last story so we
can get the fuck out of here!

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:17.267
Erica.

01:29:17.301 --> 01:29:18.936
Sit down!

01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:22.868
I'm gonna tell the final story.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.068
Many, many years ago,

01:29:30.102 --> 01:29:32.169
there was a little girl.

01:29:32.201 --> 01:29:33.501
She was an orphan.

01:29:34.634 --> 01:29:37.467
Her parents had
die in an accident,

01:29:37.501 --> 01:29:40.869
so, her grandmother took her in.

01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:44.935
When the girl turns 11,

01:29:44.968 --> 01:29:47.369
her grandma tells her a secret.

01:29:48.334 --> 01:29:52.434
She knows a turn about
spells and enchantments.

01:29:52.468 --> 01:29:57.469
So, she start teaching
her some of these secrets.

01:29:59.234 --> 01:30:02.935
The girl thinks her
grandma totally rocks.

01:30:04.101 --> 01:30:06.334
But the neighbors
don't think so.

01:30:08.268 --> 01:30:11.468
They think she cast
the evil eye on them,

01:30:12.534 --> 01:30:17.268
and blame her for all their
financial and health problems.

01:30:19.901 --> 01:30:23.401
The neighbors start
to attack her,

01:30:23.434 --> 01:30:26.301
throwing stones at the house,

01:30:26.335 --> 01:30:29.135
threatening to leave
the neighborhood.

01:30:29.168 --> 01:30:31.902
That's the beginning
of the nightmare.

01:30:31.934 --> 01:30:36.102
The attacks get more and
more frequent and vicious.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:41.901
The grandma and the girl
start feeling deeply bitter

01:30:41.934 --> 01:30:43.168
toward the rest.

01:30:44.635 --> 01:30:48.936
One day, the girl goes to camp
with her school for a week.

01:30:50.102 --> 01:30:54.568
During camp, she has horrible
premonitions and nightmares.

01:30:55.567 --> 01:30:58.602
The house is unusually silent.

01:30:58.634 --> 01:31:00.968
She looks everywhere
for her grandma,

01:31:02.201 --> 01:31:04.169
until she gets to her room.

01:31:05.968 --> 01:31:07.935
There she is.

01:31:07.969 --> 01:31:10.936
Lying on the floor, dead.

01:31:10.969 --> 01:31:12.969
The cat is sitting on her body.

01:31:14.601 --> 01:31:18.401
And he ate the most of her face.

01:31:20.002 --> 01:31:21.169
Much later,

01:31:21.835 --> 01:31:24.568
during police investigations,

01:31:24.601 --> 01:31:27.901
they determined the grandmother

01:31:27.935 --> 01:31:30.969
had been attacked with
a brick to her head.

01:31:32.968 --> 01:31:36.235
The girl was sent
to an orphanage,

01:31:37.368 --> 01:31:40.936
where she spends
the following years

01:31:40.968 --> 01:31:44.902
building more and more
fury and bitterness.

01:31:45.936 --> 01:31:50.968
The girl finally gets older
and leaves the orphanage.

01:31:52.034 --> 01:31:57.002
The first thing she does is get
back to her grandma's house.

01:31:59.601 --> 01:32:04.201
Then took the book
from the library.

01:32:04.234 --> 01:32:07.569
It's a collection
of horror stories,

01:32:07.601 --> 01:32:11.868
called, "The 100 Candles Game."

01:32:13.534 --> 01:32:18.536
Then persuades the
neighbors' children

01:32:19.934 --> 01:32:23.201
to play the game in
the very same house.

01:32:24.968 --> 01:32:26.002
Now...

01:32:27.535 --> 01:32:32.067
It's time to reap the
fruit of her wrath.

01:32:57.033 --> 01:32:58.000
James!

01:32:58.033 --> 01:32:58.902
James?

01:33:03.434 --> 01:33:04.268
James?

01:33:05.467 --> 01:33:06.301
Are you there?

01:33:15.068 --> 01:33:15.968
Alex?

01:33:21.067 --> 01:33:22.501
Where are you guys?

01:33:30.134 --> 01:33:31.068
James?

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.035
Alex?

01:33:58.531 --> 01:34:03.531
