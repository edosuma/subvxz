until you hit that line, okay?

01:28.680 --> 01:34.320

-Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

can we talk about this at dinner?

02:21.320 --> 02:23.840
Right now,
Andrew really needs to stay focused.

But, Dad, I was just checking out
the trophy. I mean...

if he took just a little break?

Now, do we really wanna risk that

02:43.400 --> 02:45.920

that we could?

02:48.880 --> 02:51.960
Dad's right. Better get back to work.

around here someplace?

and get cleaned up for dinner!

03:12.040 --> 03:15.000

03:15.400 --> 03:17.080
He's getting there. He's getting there.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.840
We still got a lot of work to do
if he's gonna be competitive.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.560
Well, as long as he tries his best,
I'm sure he'll do fine.

I could feel the victory, you know?

03:40.440 --> 03:42.360
It was on the tips of my fingers.

03:42.440 --> 03:45.040
Well, I'm surprised you can feel anything
with all the stuff you got all over you.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.720
Now get inside and change.
Oh! Don't sit on anything.

What? I'm not even that greasy.
What are you talking about?

03:52.760 --> 03:54.240
Looks like you're getting faster.

03:54.320 --> 03:55.840

do this every day until the first race.

When I was racing, I got up at dawn

04:09.640 --> 04:12.480
and I rode until it was so dark,
I couldn't see.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.480
My father had to drag me inside.

Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.

have already signed a petition

04:20.040 --> 04:22.680
to have us thrown out
of the homeowners' association.

See, I'm not trying to force you to do
anything you don't want to do, Andrew.

I'm just saying, once you get out there
and you see how fast those other guys are,

Just some old clothes, you know.
I was gonna donate them to the poor.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.880
Well, good for you, sweetheart.

15:57.280 --> 16:01.360
Mom, he'll call. Don't worry about it.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.120
Of course, he will, sweetie.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.760
Andrea Rose, what in the world...

16:07.960 --> 16:09.040
Oh...

16:09.560 --> 16:11.440
I tripped over myself. You know me.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.640
Was that before or after you took clothes

16:14.720 --> 16:17.120
to those poor,
underprivileged motocross racers?

16:20.280 --> 16:21.360
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

16:22.240 --> 16:25.200
If I didn't keep missing my shift,
I would have smoked them.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.760
I just need new boots.

16:27.560 --> 16:28.880
Look, I already told you what would happen

16:28.960 --> 16:30.720
if you went out and tried to race
with a bunch of guys.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.360
I mean, imagine if those were actual pros
and you tried to run with them.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.160
What are you trying to say?

16:36.240 --> 16:38.560
If I was a guy,
this never would have happened?

16:38.640 --> 16:40.880
Unfortunately, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.320
-Mom?
-Mmm?

16:52.400 --> 16:55.360
Jimmy Bottles called this morning,
said those parts we ordered were in.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.080
I figured we might as well
get things ready for when Dad gets home.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.760
Okay, honey.
I've got errands to run anyway, so...

17:02.120 --> 17:05.120
Andrea Rose,
do you need anything while we're in town?

17:05.760 --> 17:07.360
I think she went to the mall with Kelly.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.680
Oh, all righty. Well, let's hurry then.

17:09.760 --> 17:12.040
Wanna get home
just in case your father calls.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.600
Let's find your little brother.

17:31.640 --> 17:34.000
Jimmy Bottles. What up, dude?

17:34.080 --> 17:37.000
What's up, Andy C? Did you just
teleport over here, man?

17:37.080 --> 17:40.200
-I just rapped with you on the phone.
-You did?

17:40.880 --> 17:42.000
(LAUGHS)

17:42.280 --> 17:45.080
Dude, we just hung up.
Those parts you ordered...

17:47.080 --> 17:48.880
The parts! Right. Yeah.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.760
I'm just fired up about
getting my motorcycle running again.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.080
Oh, yeah, I heard, man.
Gnarly crash. Yeah.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.280
Not enough to keep you
out of the cup series, though.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.000
No, dude, I'm all over it.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.040
Killer! Yeah.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.120
Okay. I'll go get the parts for you.
Anything else you need?

18:04.280 --> 18:06.120
I wanted to check out some boots.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.880
Boots. Right over there.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.480
BOY 1: Check this out.
BOY 2: Wow!

18:21.600 --> 18:23.160
Hey, Jimmy. How's it going?

18:25.200 --> 18:26.320
(LAUGHS)

18:26.480 --> 18:28.280
Dude, I know my eyes are jacked,

18:28.360 --> 18:30.960
but you did not have those crutches
a second ago.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.960
Well, it would be kind of tough
to get over here without them.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.200
You're messing with me, right?

18:36.160 --> 18:37.400
Are you feeling okay?

18:40.800 --> 18:43.720
I get it. You've been spraying air filters

18:43.800 --> 18:45.400
with the windows closed again,
haven't you?

18:45.520 --> 18:49.800
No. Look... Yeah.
Yeah. Maybe that's... Yeah. Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.160
So, you find any boots?

18:51.880 --> 18:55.520
Uh... No. I don't need boots.
Just the parts.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.760
My mom will be over from next door
in a minute to pay for them.

18:58.840 --> 19:00.000
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.240
Do you mind if I use the bathroom, Jimmy?

19:02.320 --> 19:04.880
No, bro. It's all yours. Help yourself.

19:05.600 --> 19:06.640
Wow.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.400
Hey! You little annoying dudes.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.480
Shouldn't you guys
be in school or something?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.200
BOY: It's summer. There is no school.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.800
(LAUGHS) Yeah? Yeah, well,
maybe you should be

19:18.880 --> 19:20.600
to fully review the reading thing.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.480
Yeah.

19:28.120 --> 19:32.560
Dude, you're freaking me out.
You know that? You're freaking me out.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.120
What's wrong, Jimmy?

19:34.200 --> 19:37.840
All right. First you don't have
your crutches, and then you do, all right?

19:37.920 --> 19:40.760
Then you don't have the boots,
and now you want the boots.

19:41.040 --> 19:44.320
You know what? I forgot something.
Can you save just these for me?

19:44.400 --> 19:45.760
Yeah, help yourself, man.

19:45.840 --> 19:48.680
I just gotta get
a new prescription or something.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.840
-Andrew?
-Yeah, Mom?

20:00.120 --> 20:02.920
Didn't you just... Didn't he just...

20:03.000 --> 20:05.160
Jason? Jason! (SIGHS)

20:05.760 --> 20:06.800
Never mind.

20:11.600 --> 20:16.640
Dude! What is with this disappearing
crutch trick, man? You're killing me!

20:17.240 --> 20:20.000
You know what? Fine. Forget it. Okay?

20:20.920 --> 20:26.000
Whatever. Okay, your total,
it comes to $550.25.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.080
How many parts did you order?

20:28.200 --> 20:29.600
Not $500 worth.

20:29.840 --> 20:32.000
Bro, the boots were $300, and...

20:32.080 --> 20:33.480
-Boots?
-Boots?

20:34.280 --> 20:35.800
I already told you.
I don't need any boots.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.240
These aren't even my size.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.960
(WHIMPERS)

20:44.800 --> 20:48.480
-Let me put those back for you, Jimmy.
-Yeah. Thank you. I appreciate that.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.840
Jimmy, how much does it come to
without the boots?

21:03.040 --> 21:04.440
I'm changing, dude.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.240
I think changing is an understatement.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.920
(EXCLAIMS AND LAUGHS)

21:20.280 --> 21:21.680
What happened to your hair?

21:22.880 --> 21:27.080
This is some deep-seated psychological,
father-daughter reaction thing, isn't it?

21:27.160 --> 21:28.840
Look, admit it. This could work.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.920
I show up dressed as you,
acting like you, race,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.160
we stay in the series, and then as soon as
Dad comes back, we switch back riders.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.960
There's so much wrong with that plan.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.840
-Name one thing.
-How about Mom?

21:39.920 --> 21:41.520
She'll freak. She will absolutely freak.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.000
Not to mention if Dad finds out,
he's gonna ground us. You know that?

21:44.080 --> 21:46.720
Neither one of them is gonna find out.
Are they, Jason?

21:46.800 --> 21:48.320
Why do you always look at me
when you say that?

21:48.400 --> 21:52.200
Okay, Jason, Andrew.
Come on, guys. We gotta get going.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.800
Oh.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.680
Jason, who was your brother
just talking to?

22:14.920 --> 22:16.480
I didn't see anyone.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.280
ANNOUNCER:
<i>...looking for gold here</i>

22:23.360 --> 22:24.720
<i>in the freestyle Moto-X.</i>

22:24.800 --> 22:28.040
-Those are awesome brakes.
-He is so awesome. Yeah.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.720
-Did he call?
-Mmm.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.800
Not yet.
You know, part of me hopes he will,

22:35.880 --> 22:39.680
and the other is praying he doesn't
so I don't have to break the news to him.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.840
Um...

22:41.960 --> 22:43.360
I'm going to go into town tomorrow

22:43.440 --> 22:46.080
with Cindy and some of the girls early.
Is that okay?

22:46.320 --> 22:47.360
Yeah, I suppose.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.760
-Can I go?
-No! You'll be bored.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.280
I'll probably be gone before you wake up,
and I didn't want you to worry.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.800
Mmm. Well, thanks for the consideration.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.200
-(CHUCKLES)
-Uh...

23:00.400 --> 23:03.960
By the way, honey, where were you today?
We missed you.

23:06.160 --> 23:07.400
I was at the mall.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.320
Hmm. Did you buy anything?

23:12.280 --> 23:13.560
Some clothes.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.960
ANDREW: Yeah. She's trying out a new-look.

23:15.400 --> 23:19.200
-You should see it, Mom.
-Yeah. You'd hardly recognize her.

23:24.520 --> 23:27.200
Okay. Somebody want to tell me
what's going on around here?

23:27.280 --> 23:30.800
Nothing. Mom, everything's fine.

23:31.320 --> 23:35.440
Well, you know I will find out eventually.
It's just a matter of time.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.840
-(TIMER BEEPS)
-(SIGHING IN FRUSTRATION)

23:51.960 --> 23:53.280
I don't know anything.

23:54.680 --> 23:55.720
I promise.

23:57.720 --> 23:58.880
Oh, Mom...

24:00.480 --> 24:02.200
(ROOSTER CROWING)

24:03.440 --> 24:06.440
I brought you those boots
that you said you didn't need.

24:06.680 --> 24:07.840
Thanks.

24:10.200 --> 24:14.040
Dude, I don't get you, man.
How are you gonna ride and stuff?

24:14.120 --> 24:16.000
'Cause yesterday you were,
like, on crutches.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.520
I think you were...
Weren't you? I don't know.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.040
You're messing with my head.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.640
-Just don't worry about it.
-Yeah?

24:22.720 --> 24:25.920
I'm ready to ride,
and I really appreciate this, so...

24:26.000 --> 24:27.720
Look, you've got
your driving glasses, right?

24:27.800 --> 24:29.560
Yeah. Check them out, man.

24:35.120 --> 24:38.840
You know, if I remember correctly,
the mall doesn't open till 10:00,

24:38.920 --> 24:42.120
and I don't think
they let motorcycles inside.

24:43.040 --> 24:46.200
Hey, Mrs. Carson. How you doing?

24:46.280 --> 24:49.760
Jimmy. I'm sure that "Andrew"
appreciates everything,

24:49.840 --> 24:52.320
but this is one race
he's not gonna be riding in.

24:54.640 --> 24:58.320
Okay. Uh... That was weird.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.240
We should probably
get your bike outta my truck,

25:01.320 --> 25:05.200
'cause I got other places to go
if you're not going, man.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.200
What's going on here?

25:08.640 --> 25:10.960
(SIGHS) I cannot believe that you were
actually gonna go through with this.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.200
Not to mention the fact
that you were gonna

25:13.280 --> 25:15.120
get into a car with Jimmy Bottles.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.880
He had his driving glasses.

25:17.560 --> 25:20.080
Besides, I wasn't gonna
sit back and do nothing.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.680
Mmm-hmm.
And just look at your beautiful hair.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.480
Tell you one thing.
We're going over to the salon first thing

25:25.560 --> 25:27.480
and see if there's anything
that they can do with it.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.520
Now, go put the motorcycle
back in the garage.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.880
Now do you know why I always look at you?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.480
I'm sorry! I cracked.

25:37.240 --> 25:40.560
You've seen her. I mean, she should
work for the CIA or something.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.520
Mom, why won't you let Andi race?

25:51.800 --> 25:54.080
Because girls don't race motorcycles.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.600
Well, they do, but not with boys.
It's just not done.

25:58.280 --> 26:01.160
But in school, they were teaching us
about women's rights.

26:01.240 --> 26:02.840
And Mrs. Cabison was saying that

26:02.920 --> 26:05.480
today there aren't any jobs
that women can't do.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.200
You know, and how great it is
that we've come so far and everything.

26:08.760 --> 26:12.040
So, I guess I don't understand
why Andi can't race.

26:12.600 --> 26:15.400
I mean, she's as good
as those guys, right?

26:15.800 --> 26:18.360
I don't want to talk about this.
Go upstairs, make your bed.

26:19.880 --> 26:20.920
I already did.

26:21.160 --> 26:24.560
Well, then, go upstairs
and put these clothes away,

26:24.640 --> 26:26.680
neatly, in their proper place.

26:35.480 --> 26:38.040
Oh, Geneva, don't even go there.

26:40.360 --> 26:45.640
Just go back and fold your laundry
and think about something else.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.400
Okay, explain something to me.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.280
Is this all because you feel guilty
about what happened to your brother,

26:57.680 --> 26:59.880
or is this something
you really want to do?

27:00.960 --> 27:02.400
Which one will get you to let me go?

27:02.480 --> 27:04.200
We're not even
talking about that right now.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.800
I just want to know the truth.

27:07.280 --> 27:10.080
Look, I really want to ride,
and I can win.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.520
(SIGHS)

27:13.720 --> 27:15.000
Do we still have time to get there?

27:15.080 --> 27:16.840
-Are you serious?
-Serious.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.600
Yeah, if we go now.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.400
Well, if we're gonna do this,
might as well do it right.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.240
What made you change your mind?

27:35.160 --> 27:38.480
Did you think I was gonna let you
save this family single-handedly,

27:38.560 --> 27:41.960
and take all the glory?
Honey, you know me better than that.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.200
ANNOUNCER: (ON PA)
<i>Welcome, race fans,</i>

27:46.280 --> 27:48.200
<i>to the Phil Rollins Motorsports</i>
<i>Factory Cup.</i>

27:48.280 --> 27:52.200
<i>While in the pit area we ask that you</i>
<i>please observe all safety regulations...</i>

28:05.880 --> 28:08.800
You know, the first time I met your dad
was at a racetrack.

28:08.880 --> 28:11.240
The smell always brings back
those wonderful memories.

28:11.520 --> 28:15.080
-Hey, look. Dude brought his mommy.
-Brutal.

28:16.680 --> 28:21.200
You know what, I better go up
and check in. (SIGHS) I'll be back.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.720
Take your time, honey. I'll just stay here
and get everything organized.

28:26.920 --> 28:29.440
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Riders, you have 30 minutes to register.</i>

28:29.520 --> 28:32.200
<i>If you haven't, please do so immediately.</i>

28:39.720 --> 28:41.440
RACER:
Nice manicure, dude.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.720
Cuts down vibration in the bars
and helps reduce arm pump.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.360
Whatever, dude.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.640
Andy Carson, 125 pro.

29:19.800 --> 29:23.280
Welcome to the Phil Rollins Cup, Andy.
Good luck.

29:27.440 --> 29:30.480
Andy Carson? You made it. Good.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.320
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Heard a lot of good things about you.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.120
Great. Thanks.

29:35.200 --> 29:37.000
You know, there was a rumor
that you broke the leg.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.520
I figured you'd be a no-show.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.400
Well, you know what they say about rumors.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.040
They start with a kernel of the truth.

29:42.280 --> 29:46.080
Look, hey, I'm Bob Arness
from Phil Rollins Motorsports.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.920
We're the one
that's putting on this series.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.080
You know, we need to talk.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.480
I want to find out about

29:50.560 --> 29:52.040
-the man beneath the helmet.
-(CHUCKLES)

29:52.240 --> 29:53.280
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

29:53.360 --> 29:54.680
Excuse me one second.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.280
Bob Arness.

29:58.120 --> 30:00.600
Yes. I'm here at the starters' table.

30:00.880 --> 30:04.240
Yes. I was just about to...
Yes. You're right. You're right.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.160
I'll be right there. Okay.

30:07.440 --> 30:11.000
My boss. Fair, yet demanding.
We'll do this later.

30:14.560 --> 30:17.840
Man beneath the helmet. Great.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.320
Yeah, just be yourself.

30:22.680 --> 30:23.880
You mean, be you.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.160
<i>Yeah, good point.</i>

30:25.680 --> 30:26.960
When's your first moto?

30:27.040 --> 30:28.920
It's 20 minutes from now.
I better get going.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.080
Oh, and Jason says set the forks
two clicks left for the braking bumps.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.280
Look, tell him thanks.

30:34.360 --> 30:35.520
She says thanks.

30:36.280 --> 30:37.800
Man, they should have let me come.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.840
You know, they're gonna need me
sooner or later.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.640
Okay, Mom wants to talk to you.

30:46.160 --> 30:48.360
Hi, sweetie. Did your dad call yet?

30:48.480 --> 30:51.880
Not yet, which I'm thinking is probably
a good thing right about now.

30:52.080 --> 30:53.880
GENEVA:
And is Mrs. Sloan looking in on you?

30:54.880 --> 30:56.080
Oh, good.

31:00.120 --> 31:03.520
Okay, honey, I gotta go.
Yeah, I love you. Bye-bye.

31:04.320 --> 31:07.560
Excuse me. I couldn't help notice
you were doing your nails,

31:07.640 --> 31:10.760
and, well, I broke one when I was getting
in my car, and I was...

31:10.840 --> 31:12.280
Say no more. Have a seat.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.520
-This is so sweet of you.
-Ooh.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.640
Okay, I'm heading to the line.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.720
Honey, this is gonna
have to wait a little bit.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.080
You see, this is my daughter...
My son's first big race.

31:24.160 --> 31:26.120
Oh, that's so sweet. Hi, I'm Angela.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.720
Andy. Nice to meet you.

31:28.440 --> 31:30.960
Mom, why don't you just wait here?
I'm sure I'll be fine.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.880
No possible way. Under no circumstances
am I gonna miss my boy's U.S. debut.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.520
Besides, honey, I want to help.

31:36.600 --> 31:39.800
Mom, none of the other guys have
their moms with them on the starting line.

31:41.560 --> 31:44.360
Besides, if you want to watch the race,
why don't you just watch from here, okay?

31:46.120 --> 31:48.200
Well, if you're sure.

31:48.920 --> 31:50.040
I'm sure, okay?

With me today is Keith Alan.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.200
He's been on the pit floor
all morning long.

32:06.320 --> 32:09.320
Keith, what's the attitude?
What's the feeling down there in the pits?

32:09.400 --> 32:12.000
Well, the pits are abuzz,
and everybody's hungry for a slice

33:23.920 --> 33:26.920

33:31.000 --> 33:33.560

34:15.960 --> 34:18.400
(CROWD CHEERING)

34:30.160 --> 34:32.800
Now, honey, you didn't really expect
to beat all those guys

34:32.880 --> 34:34.080
your very first time, did you?

34:34.160 --> 34:36.280
Yeah, but I didn't think
I was gonna be in the way.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.320
You finished the race.
That's all that matters.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.800
Now, you do the same thing
in the next heat,

34:39.880 --> 34:42.000
you've accomplished
what you came here for.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.320
There she is!

34:49.560 --> 34:51.120
I showed the other girls what you did,

34:51.520 --> 34:54.000
and they were hoping
if you wouldn't mind...

34:54.720 --> 34:57.600
I don't see why not.
Looks like a very long day ahead of us.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.760
Did you know I was a trophy girl
when I was your age?

35:00.840 --> 35:02.480
-Really?
-I was.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.560
How sick is that, Dean? Look at that.

35:05.640 --> 35:09.040
That guy shows up for one race,
which he gets smoked in, by the way,

35:09.120 --> 35:11.400
and he's got every chick in this place
swarming his rig.

35:12.720 --> 35:15.240
What can I say?
I guess some guys are just magnets.

35:18.520 --> 35:20.880
You need to chill on Faryn Henderson.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.080
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

35:23.160 --> 35:25.920
Need I remind you,
she's not only out of your league,

35:26.000 --> 35:27.240
that's the owner's daughter.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.960
That's like career suicide.
I must discourage you, <i>amigo.</i>

35:31.560 --> 35:33.240
Never gave it a second thought, Danny.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.400
Whoa!

35:35.120 --> 35:39.920
Oh, my gosh. What a geek.
No, not you, hon.

35:40.560 --> 35:44.200
Hey, dude, maybe you should get the 411
from Carson over there.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.720
Some deodorant, opening lines maybe?

35:46.800 --> 35:49.800

it's working for him.

Well, Dean, you've mastered the fact that
the gas is on the right.

Congratulations, man.
You just smoked the field out there,

37:27.200 --> 37:28.560
making it look super easy.

37:28.640 --> 37:29.880
What do you think
made the difference for you?

37:29.960 --> 37:32.000
First of all,
I got off to a great start, Keith.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.080
And my Henderson Racing bike
was running great,

37:35.160 --> 37:38.320
so I'm just stoked
to get the first round out of the way.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.680
Well, congratulations.
You now have to look to the...

That's just number one
in a long line of wins

37:42.800 --> 37:45.520
you're gonna see this summer
from Art Henderson Racing.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.400
That's Art Henderson himself...

37:47.480 --> 37:51.400
And not only in the 250,
but Donny Barrett is gonna take the 125.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.120

38:27.960 --> 38:30.320
Me, win? Yeah, right.

38:31.120 --> 38:35.120
Hey, you're probably the best guy
at your track back home, right?

38:35.800 --> 38:36.960
Pretty much.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.040
So is every rider out here.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.880
These guys are like the top riders
at all their home tracks.

38:41.960 --> 38:45.560
One of them might even be the next Emig
or McGrath or Windham.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.200
Bye, Andy!

38:47.520 --> 38:48.640
Bye, Dean.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.840
Dude, I don't get it.

38:56.120 --> 38:58.800
They're, like, women in their 20s.

38:59.680 --> 39:02.040
They don't ever give a 125 guy a look.

39:03.400 --> 39:08.000
Yeah, well, I guess I've always felt that
I could relate pretty well to girls.

39:09.280 --> 39:12.000
Well, hey, I better get back
to the semi, you know?

39:12.080 --> 39:14.280
Just to make sure
everything's going smooth.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.680
Yeah. Thanks for everything.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.360
Sure, sure. Yeah.

39:19.160 --> 39:22.880
Hey, you wouldn't want to go, you know,
check it out or anything?

39:22.960 --> 39:24.440
It's actually pretty cool.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.200
I feel like I have a week's worth
of dirt on me.

39:27.280 --> 39:30.560
I'm gonna go home and take
the longest bubble bath on record.

39:33.160 --> 39:35.720
Go if you want.
I'm in the best part of my book,

39:35.800 --> 39:38.200
and I'd just
as soon find out what happens.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.320
ANDREA: I'll be back soon.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.120
Oh, no, take your time, sweetheart.

39:57.720 --> 40:01.680
Hey, dude, let me be the first to salute
your superior babe magnetism.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.640
Um... Thanks.

40:05.400 --> 40:09.480
So basically, you've got, like, enough
parts in here to build five spare bikes.

40:09.560 --> 40:10.800
Yeah, basically.

40:10.880 --> 40:13.600
Well, then why are you
even in the factory sponsorship?

40:13.920 --> 40:17.120
Because factory sponsorship
equals factory support.

40:17.200 --> 40:20.640
I mean, we get their expertise on
making the bikes go as fast as they can.

40:21.680 --> 40:24.600
Shoot, they spend as much on this fork
as we do three bikes.

40:25.280 --> 40:28.040
That's what it takes to win
in the stadiums. You know, on TV?

40:28.400 --> 40:30.520
(SCOFFS)
And I was stoked on our rig.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.680
Yeah.

40:31.760 --> 40:34.040
-How's it going, lapper?
-Yo, chill out, dude.

40:35.400 --> 40:39.040
Faryn, hey. This is Carson Andrews.

-Hi.
-Tommy Girl, right?

40:48.080 --> 40:49.920
-What?
-Your perfume.

40:50.560 --> 40:51.840
How'd you know?

40:54.280 --> 40:57.040
My sister wears it.
It smells a lot better on you, though.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.320
Thanks.

41:07.040 --> 41:09.760
You know better
than to bring the competition in here.

41:10.640 --> 41:13.920
Don't worry about it, boss.
He's no competition.

41:15.520 --> 41:19.800
You know, I better get going.
We got a gnarly drive home.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.520
Yeah. Yeah.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.920
Yo, Andy! Hold up, man.

41:32.200 --> 41:33.880
Dude, I gotta cop to something.

41:34.280 --> 41:37.040
Let me guess.
You're madly in love with Faryn Henderson?

41:37.480 --> 41:38.640
Is it that obvious?

41:38.720 --> 41:41.440
Dude, you're toast. You're like Jell-O.

41:41.520 --> 41:43.840
I know, man.
I want to go out with her so bad.

41:45.040 --> 41:46.080
And?

41:46.160 --> 41:50.360
And every time I see her, I just tank it.
You know?

41:51.080 --> 41:54.520
It's like coming up on a triple, and then
just letting off, you know? Casing it.

41:54.600 --> 41:56.360
Pain. Ambulance.

41:56.640 --> 41:58.480
-It's a nice visual.
-Thanks.

42:00.520 --> 42:01.720
That's why I got a deal for you.

42:01.800 --> 42:02.840
A deal?

42:03.080 --> 42:06.000
Look, if you're gonna
go compete with those guys,

42:06.080 --> 42:08.920
there's some things you gotta know,
and I can teach you.

42:09.680 --> 42:12.240
In return, you're gonna have
to do something for me.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.440
And that something would be...

42:14.520 --> 42:18.440
Talk to her, dude. Come on, Danny's right.
You are a genius with women.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.880
All you gotta do is get her to go out
with me one time. I'll do the rest.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.640
(STAMMERS) I really would, but...

42:24.240 --> 42:26.640
I don't even think I'm gonna be here
for the next couple of races.

42:27.720 --> 42:28.760
What are you talking about?

42:28.840 --> 42:31.800
Look, I really can't explain,
but it's like a freaky family thing.

42:32.480 --> 42:33.720
Well, there's got to be some kind of way

42:33.800 --> 42:35.000
that you could just,
you know, get her to...

42:35.080 --> 42:38.520
Look, I can't... But, you know,
thanks for giving me the grand tour.

42:38.600 --> 42:39.880
It was really cool.

42:41.440 --> 42:42.480
Yeah.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.720
Okay, I love you. Bye.

42:47.800 --> 42:50.360
Well, I think
that's about the cutest boy ever.

42:51.040 --> 42:55.520
If I wasn't the second cutest boy,
I might actually have a chance.

42:57.280 --> 42:58.560
Was that Daddy?

42:58.640 --> 42:59.800
It was indeed.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.680
Well, did he find another rider?

43:03.760 --> 43:04.800
Not yet.

43:09.240 --> 43:10.840
You didn't tell him, did you?

43:11.520 --> 43:14.840
Must have slipped my mind.
You know how forgetful I can be.

43:21.120 --> 43:23.840
Honey, you really loved that
out there today, didn't you?

43:23.960 --> 43:25.160
(SIGHS)

43:25.440 --> 43:29.120
Yeah. Look, I know that
I can beat those guys.

43:29.200 --> 43:32.880
I just wish
I didn't have to quit right now

43:32.960 --> 43:34.360
so that I could find out for sure.

43:35.600 --> 43:38.960
Well, young lady, I guess this is one
of those defining moments

43:39.040 --> 43:40.400
-that they're always talking about.
-(GROANS)

43:40.480 --> 43:41.960
Defining moments?

43:42.040 --> 43:44.040
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, we all have one of those
in our lifetime.

43:44.120 --> 43:45.360
Well, did you?

43:45.440 --> 43:49.280
Sure. Yeah, I was just
a little bit older than you,

43:49.360 --> 43:51.200
and I was singing in this band...

43:51.600 --> 43:52.800
No way!

43:52.960 --> 43:54.120
-Oh, way!
-(BOTH LAUGH)

43:54.640 --> 43:57.120
Don't look so shocked.
I was actually kind of good.

43:58.160 --> 44:01.840
And I loved singing just about as much
as you like riding that motorcycle.

44:01.920 --> 44:03.440
Now, unfortunately, your grandmother

44:03.520 --> 44:05.200
about had a heart attack
when she found out,

44:05.280 --> 44:08.240
and she said if I quit right away,
she would never tell Grandpa.

44:08.320 --> 44:10.280
-Well, what did you do?
-I quit right away.

44:11.280 --> 44:14.160
And there hasn't been a day
where I haven't wondered about

44:14.360 --> 44:16.040
whether I did the right thing.

44:16.360 --> 44:18.520
Now, on one hand,
I did meet the man of my dreams

44:18.600 --> 44:21.360
and have
the three best kids on this Earth,

44:21.440 --> 44:25.760
but I still wish that I could have
at least given it a chance.

44:27.120 --> 44:29.120
And I promised myself a long time ago

44:29.200 --> 44:32.280
that I would never let my kids
give up on their dreams.

44:33.840 --> 44:37.280
So what do you say? You up for it?

44:37.400 --> 44:40.000
You and I...
Carson Racing against the world.

44:40.520 --> 44:42.720
Or at least
against the rest of the Southwest.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.600
(BOTH LAUGHING)

44:44.920 --> 44:46.760
-You're serious?
-Absolutely.

44:46.960 --> 44:49.080
Now, honey, I have been
doing a little reading here,

44:49.160 --> 44:50.200
and if we're gonna win this cup,

44:50.280 --> 44:51.760
you're gonna have
to start getting some points.

44:52.880 --> 44:54.880
Don't worry.
I know how to make sure that we do.

45:01.160 --> 45:02.960
-I'll do it.
-Do what?

45:03.040 --> 45:04.720
You got a deal.
You hook me up on the track,

45:04.800 --> 45:06.400
and I'll hook you up with Faryn.

45:06.880 --> 45:08.200
All right.

45:08.680 --> 45:10.200
Start now. Get your bike.

You wanted the secret to winning, right?
Here it is.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.760
Now, Carson, you know how to make turns
and how to jump,

45:49.120 --> 45:51.280
but what you don't know how to do
is retrain.

45:51.920 --> 45:53.760
You know, all the different surfaces.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.600
Out here, you learn all that,
so when you get on the track,

45:56.680 --> 45:59.040

Mom, you know
how great Andrew is at riding?

47:46.720 --> 47:49.600
Well, that's how bad he is at cooking.

47:49.920 --> 47:51.680
Honey, come on. It can't be that bad.

47:51.760 --> 47:54.760
Last night, we had spaghetti
that crunched.

47:54.840 --> 47:58.600
I mean, that's the first time in my life
I've ever actually been afraid of food.

47:58.680 --> 48:01.440
Now, Jason, honey, we're gonna be home
before you know it, so, please,

48:01.520 --> 48:03.880
just do whatever you can
to help your brother out, okay?

48:03.960 --> 48:06.840

-That's my boy. Bye.

I wasn't looking where I was going.

That's okay.

48:27.640 --> 48:30.400
I'm on a post-shopping high.
I kinda lose myself.

48:30.480 --> 48:32.240
I know what you're talking about.

48:32.320 --> 48:33.360
You do?

48:33.440 --> 48:35.240
Well, yeah, I saw this thing
on the Learning Channel

48:35.320 --> 48:41.000
about shopping euphoria,
or maybe it was shoplifting. I don't know.

48:41.160 --> 48:42.400
Hey, you're the guy from the races, right?

48:42.520 --> 48:43.640
Uh-huh.

-Are you staying here, too?
-Yeah. You know, I'm looking for Dean.

48:48.120 --> 48:50.840
-You haven't seen him, have you?
-Why would I see Dean?

48:51.760 --> 48:54.160
I don't know. You guys, like,
never hang out or anything?

48:54.240 --> 48:56.760
Me and Dean? (SCOFFS) Get real.

48:57.600 --> 48:58.640
Why not?

48:59.800 --> 49:02.640
I don't know.
I guess he's just not my type.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.480
Well, what exactly is your type?

49:05.280 --> 49:07.560
I'm looking for more out of a relationship

49:07.640 --> 49:11.680
than a guy who never changes
out of motocross tee-shirts and jeans

49:11.760 --> 49:15.440
and spends every waking moment
thinking of loopholes and knickknacks.

49:16.480 --> 49:18.480
That's holeshots and nac nacs.

49:18.880 --> 49:19.960
Whatever.

49:20.480 --> 49:22.840
Well, I mean,
at least he's dedicated to something.

49:22.920 --> 49:25.440
Well, I want my guy dedicated to me.

49:48.440 --> 49:50.000
then I don't have to bum him out
about Faryn.

49:50.080 --> 49:52.720
So if he comes by,
just tell him that I'm not here, okay?

49:52.800 --> 49:54.320
Where would you like me to say you are?

49:54.640 --> 49:57.120
I don't know. Just tell him that I went
for doughnuts or something, okay?

49:57.400 --> 49:58.440
DEAN: Doughnuts?

49:59.240 --> 50:00.800
Carson, you know you're in training.

50:02.320 --> 50:05.080
Well, hello there, Dean.
We were actually just talking

50:05.160 --> 50:09.200
about how thankful Andy is for you
taking time with him yesterday.

50:09.280 --> 50:11.360
I had a great time, too, Mrs. Carson.

50:13.360 --> 50:14.640
Well, I'll just leave you two

50:14.720 --> 50:18.920
to talk engines or chicks
or whatever it is you talk.

50:25.320 --> 50:28.040
So? Tell me.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.240
Tell you what?

50:33.080 --> 50:34.400
Oh, come on, dude.
Just tell me what happened.

50:34.640 --> 50:37.440
I don't think she's right for you.
I think you ought to bag it.

Come on. Tell me what she said. Come on.

50:47.240 --> 50:48.520
Like...

50:50.920 --> 50:54.080
She's not into it.
She's looking for something different.

50:56.160 --> 50:59.200
I don't get it.
Like, what's she looking for?

50:59.600 --> 51:02.280
Basically, as far as I can tell,
she's looking for a guy

51:02.360 --> 51:03.920
who drives an expensive foreign car

51:04.000 --> 51:06.480
and who lives within walking distance
of the galleria.

Well, I can be that guy. I could.
Just give me a chance.

51:10.600 --> 51:12.640
Dude, you don't wanna be that guy.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.920
Just trust me on this. Forget about her.

51:17.760 --> 51:21.120
Yeah. Yeah. You're probably right.

with the training anymore, you know...

No, no, no. Look, Carson,
you have got major potential. All right?

until you can't get out of bed.

-I'm just heading back up to the room.
-Cool.

54:13.600 --> 54:15.800
Hey, congrats on today. Another one-one.

54:16.720 --> 54:20.360
Yeah. Yeah. It felt pretty good.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.520
Then why do you look like
someone just knocked you over a berm?

54:27.560 --> 54:29.560
I just can't stop thinking about her.

54:30.560 --> 54:32.280
-Man.
-It's just...

54:35.160 --> 54:37.480
It bums me out
that I don't even have a chance with her.

54:38.560 --> 54:41.640
Believe me, I know what it's like
to want someone that you can't have.

54:43.840 --> 54:45.240
Believe me. I...

54:46.280 --> 54:47.880
Look, you just can't let it get to you.

54:47.960 --> 54:49.760
You've got other things
that you've got to worry about.

54:49.840 --> 54:55.040
Hey, hey. I'm fine. Okay?
Honestly, no worries.

54:56.680 --> 54:58.240
Is that what you're telling me you want,

54:58.320 --> 55:01.680
is to see Dean and that girl together,
happily ever after?

55:02.600 --> 55:05.920
Look, I just...
I just want him to be happy, you know?

55:06.920 --> 55:11.720
And if that's what it takes,
then yes, that's exactly what I want.

55:12.520 --> 55:13.920
Oh, honey, you've got it bad.

55:15.320 --> 55:16.360
How do you know?

55:17.360 --> 55:20.560
-I was in love like this once.
-Well, what happened?

55:20.720 --> 55:23.120
Well, then I met your father
and he had more money, so...

55:23.200 --> 55:25.280
-Mother!
-Just kidding.

55:25.440 --> 55:27.680
-(PHONE RINGING)
-I'll get it.

55:31.680 --> 55:32.720
Hello?

55:32.880 --> 55:35.440
Hey, I just got your message.
You took seventh!

55:35.680 --> 55:39.040
-(CHUCKLES) Pretty cool, huh?
-I think the word is "awesome."

55:39.920 --> 55:43.760
-Any news from Dad yet?
-He called, but no luck in finding anyone.

55:43.840 --> 55:46.640
Hey, I might actually get to finish
this thing after all.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.440
Don't get your hopes up. Knowing him,

55:48.520 --> 55:50.400
he'll just show up with some guy
without even calling.

55:50.480 --> 55:52.640
Yeah. Well, that's not
exactly what I wanted to hear.

55:52.720 --> 55:54.800
<i>Hey, I found those NSYNC tickets</i>
<i>on the kitchen counter.</i>

55:54.880 --> 55:56.880
I mean, isn't that coming up
this weekend or something?

<i>you can send them to me overnight?</i>

56:13.760 --> 56:14.800
Yeah. Sure.

56:14.920 --> 56:16.960
-Okay. You have the address, right?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

56:23.000 --> 56:25.800
-What's in the box?
-Well, it's like I said before.

56:25.880 --> 56:28.080
You and I are Carson Racing, and so far,

56:28.160 --> 56:30.520
you're the only one
who's been doing any racing around here,

56:30.880 --> 56:34.200
and I thought it was about time
I started pulling my own weight.

Great race, honey.

You finish top two tomorrow,

57:07.960 --> 57:09.680
(GROANS)
Like I need that kind of pressure?

57:09.920 --> 57:11.840
By the way, Mom, could you do me a favor

57:11.920 --> 57:14.640
and please keep
the "You go, girls" to a minimum,

57:14.720 --> 57:16.480
at least until cheerleading starts again?

57:16.560 --> 57:18.560
I'm sorry, honey. I was just so excited.

57:19.160 --> 57:22.880
Not bad, rookie. You actually looked like
you knew what you were doing out there.

57:22.960 --> 57:25.720
Well, which is why I came up
with a brilliant plan

57:25.840 --> 57:27.600
to repay you for your expert advice.

57:27.680 --> 57:29.680
-What kind of plan?
-For Faryn.

57:30.040 --> 57:31.920
I discovered a way
to change everything around.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.520
That is, if you're still interested.

57:33.800 --> 57:35.880
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

57:44.120 --> 57:47.480
No way, dude. No way are you getting me
to go to an NSYNC concert.

57:47.560 --> 57:50.040
I don't care if the tickets are fifth row.

57:51.120 --> 57:53.800
You guys have NSYNC tickets? Tonight?

57:53.880 --> 57:55.400
Dean does, and get this,

57:55.480 --> 57:58.280
he's actually trying to convince me
that they have a couple good songs.

57:58.440 --> 58:00.920
Dude, I'm thinking this guy's been roosted
one too many times,

58:01.040 --> 58:02.280
'cause those guys are just, like...

58:02.360 --> 58:04.400
Wait. Do you have anybody to go with?

58:05.400 --> 58:07.840
Well, I guess not.

58:09.240 --> 58:11.160
You wouldn't be interested, would you?

58:13.760 --> 58:17.600
I'm supposed to meet my father here.
I got a message that he wanted to see me.

58:17.680 --> 58:19.000
Dude, I'll tell your dad what happened.

58:19.080 --> 58:22.120
Believe me, I don't think he would want
you to miss an opportunity like this.

58:23.520 --> 58:25.760
Okay, let me just go
change into my concert clothes, okay?

58:31.640 --> 58:34.880
-Dude, I so owe you.
-Yeah, you do.

58:35.520 --> 58:37.120
What are you gonna tell her dad?

58:37.320 --> 58:40.640
Dude, her dad is not coming down.
I'm the one who left the message for her.

58:41.400 --> 58:43.760
Why do you think she was standing here
when we came down?

Dad, I just don't understand
what is so wrong about it.

1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:25.960
It's wrong
because I asked you not to do it.

1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:29.200
I stood right here, I said,
"Stay away from motorcycles."

I mean, don't you think that's awesome?

Of course it is, but what do you think
is gonna happen when they find out

1:01:41.320 --> 1:01:44.160
she's not only not Andrew Carson,
she's his sister?

1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:47.200
They're gonna take
all those points you racked up away.

I will be the laughingstock
of the entire racing community.

1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:52.400
But, Dad, nobody is gonna find out.

1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:54.680
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:11.600
I'll never understand
what you were thinking,

1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:14.760
aiding and abetting
in Andrea's little racing caper.

1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:17.720
I don't know. It just seemed like
a good idea at the time.

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.800
In fact, part of me still thinks
it was a good idea.

1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.640
Please, tell me you don't mean that.

1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:27.760

why she shouldn't race.

"There's too much at stake.
She is just a girl."

1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:35.000
Well, the truth of the matter is,
she is just as good as any of those boys,

1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:36.720
and as far as her getting hurt,

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:40.240
well, if you're willing to allow Andrew
to take that risk,

1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:41.800
don't you think it's a bit hypocritical

1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:44.800
that you're not also willing
to do the same thing for Andrea?

1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:47.280
Hmm?

I love you, honey. Don't stay up too late.

He's going to be our new rider

1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:16.160
And you must be Andrew.
It's a shame about the leg.

1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:18.280

Right. Right. Let's give you

We'll start with the garage.
It's no factory shop,

on the Internet
or in a magazine article or something.

1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:53.040
Look. All I have to say...
If that guy kisses my hand again,

there's gonna be a WWF smackdown

for today. You've got chores to do.

I'm gonna need
just the right amount of rest

1:06:30.360 --> 1:06:32.200
if we are going
to start practicing tomorrow.

1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:34.360
That is, of course,
if it's not too much trouble.

1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:37.800
Do you have any clue
how long this is gonna take?

1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:41.520
Well, hey, I can do it, Andrew.
You can time me.

1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:44.680
(LAUGHS) If you don't mind,
I'd rather you do it, Andrew.

1:06:44.760 --> 1:06:46.200
No offense, you understand.

1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:49.240
Actually, Jason's a much better mechanic
than I am.

1:06:49.360 --> 1:06:51.040
Well, just the same, I prefer we leave it

1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:53.400
to somebody who can at least reach
the foot pegs.

1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:57.760
(YAWNS)
I'd better get to bed. I'll need my rest

1:06:57.840 --> 1:06:59.840
if we are going to start practicing
bright and early.

1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:08.760
You think, like, anyone in France
actually misses him?

1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:15.680
Hey.

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:20.440
What was that for?

1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:25.000
For everything. For this week.
For believing that I could do it.

1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:28.080
We did make a pretty good team, didn't we?

1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:30.800
-The best.
-Yeah.

1:08:03.360 --> 1:08:04.720
Hey, you want some more?

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:09.440
Are you certain
you did everything I asked?

1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:11.720
This doesn't feel like
it could win a mini-bike race.

1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:13.560
Well, my sister won on it.

1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:24.920
-How's he doing?
-He's over-revving it.

1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:27.840
I told him to take it easy
till we got the motor broken in.

1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:31.600
He's gonna blow the top end.
I can feel it.

1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:41.240

1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:47.880
And there it goes.

1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:51.560
What are you looking at?

1:08:57.920 --> 1:08:59.600
Well, that didn't sound too good, did it?

1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:05.640
You'll let me know when it's fixed.

1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:19.600
RENE: Ah.

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:22.640
I see you finally figured out
where you are most useful to the family.

1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:24.360
What is that supposed to mean?

1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:25.760
<i>Merci.</i>

1:09:27.120 --> 1:09:29.680
I heard all about
your illustrious racing career.

1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:32.920
It's amazing to me you actually believed
you could compete.

1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:35.800
I mean, you might be a novelty act,

1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:39.080
a few laps at an exhibition
between supercross racers,

1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:41.680
but with real factory riders...

1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:45.400
(GASPS)

1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:47.920
I'm sorry. Did I get you?

1:09:58.400 --> 1:09:59.480
Hey, Dad?

1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:04.440
Look, I don't mean to be a pain,
but how much do you know about this guy?

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.080
Son, I know he's had some problems,

1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:11.320
but I also know
he's a good, aggressive rider.

1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:14.920
Right now, that's something
we desperately need.

1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:17.880
How are we coming on the repairs?

1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:19.840
EDWARD: Good. Good.

1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:22.840
I'm gonna go into town
and get us a couple of parts.

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:26.600
You two start practicing
on the backup bike while I'm gone, okay?

1:10:32.560 --> 1:10:34.880
Well, let's hope this one is rideable.

1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:42.000
-Where's Andi?
-Not feeling well. She went to bed early.

1:10:43.280 --> 1:10:46.200
ANDREW: I think I'm gonna pass
on dinner also, if that's all right.

1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:48.240
I just don't feel so great.

1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:51.120
(IMITATES RENE)
Yes. I just need to hurl.

1:10:51.200 --> 1:10:53.120
-EDWARD: Jason.
-What?

1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:54.880
What'd I do?

1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:01.480
Mom said you were sick.

1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:05.480
I mean, this is ridiculous.
I could win. I did win.

COMMENTATOR: <i>Only two races left</i>

1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:14.960
Art Henderson Racing and Carson Racing
are battling neck and neck, Keith.

1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:20.880
-Where's Dad and Rene?
-Registering.

1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:23.800
They took Jason with them.

1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:26.280
Look, I gotta go run the motor a little.

1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:28.000
He says it just doesn't feel right.

1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:30.560
-No way.
-Yeah. Tell me about it.

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:33.360
This guy knows bikes
like I know nuclear physics.

1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:35.000
No. I mean, look.

1:11:36.120 --> 1:11:37.760
-Okay.
-Hey, that's not...

1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:40.520
Look. You've got to pretend...
You've got to be me, okay?

1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:42.160
No. I mean, you've got to be you.

1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:44.600
I mean,
you've got to be me being you, okay?

1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:46.360
Because technically, I don't exist.

1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:48.360
Why don't I just be me
and see how that works out?

1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:50.800
Hey, what's up, Andy?

1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.760
-Not much. How about you?
-It's all good, man.

1:11:54.160 --> 1:11:56.400
Ouch. What happened to your knee, man?

1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:00.680
An old injury flared up,
but we got a new guy to fill in.

1:12:00.760 --> 1:12:03.320
Yeah, yeah, I heard about him.
He's kind of a whack job. Huh?

1:12:03.400 --> 1:12:05.760
Yeah, tell me. We got him living with us.

1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:07.160
Ouch.

1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:11.080
By the way, this is my sister Andrea.
This is Dean, and this is...

1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:16.200
It's Faryn. Hi.
I've heard a lot about you.

1:12:16.280 --> 1:12:18.160
-Hi.
-Hi. I'm Dean.

1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:21.480
-Hi.
-Pleased to meet you.

1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:31.360
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Yeah. It's just...

1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:35.520
-You guys look so much alike.
-We are twins.

1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:42.000
Honey, I think we need to go back
to the trailer. You know how Daddy gets.

1:12:42.200 --> 1:12:43.640
DEAN: Yeah. I do.

1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:50.080
Well, hey, it was nice meeting you.
And, you, good luck out there, bro.

1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:51.680
Sorry. If you were riding,
you'd have won.

1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:54.640
-Thanks, man.
-Yeah. Bye.

1:12:58.400 --> 1:13:00.400
This is way too bizarre.

1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:05.280
Actually, I thought it went pretty well.
This is kind of fun.

1:13:05.360 --> 1:13:07.800
Maybe I should pretend to be you
being me all day.

1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:09.840

do we?

1:13:54.440 --> 1:13:57.200
Well, guess I better go
pull the top end out of the practice bike,

1:13:57.280 --> 1:13:59.280
seeing as he's fried all the other ones.

1:14:00.960 --> 1:14:02.960
Rene, congratulations on the win.

1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:05.760
You really slammed the door
on Barrett there at the end of the race,

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:08.240
but now you're a replacement rider
on Team Carson,

1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:10.520
what can you tell me
about the injured Andrew Carson?

1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:13.240
That kid, a rookie,
but really showing us some potential.

1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:17.400
Well, you know, I don't really know
anything about his injury.

1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:22.200
I guess all I can say is, it's old news,
so let's stick to the subject.

1:14:22.280 --> 1:14:23.440
Now, I got a great start today,

1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:25.560
and I think I really proved
to the Carson team

1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:27.480
how lucky they are
to have a rider like me.

1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:29.600
Yeah, but it feels
like it's got no top end, man.

1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:31.480
I mean, I'm still getting beat
in the straightaways.

1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:33.120
Hey, dude, I don't know what to tell you.

1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:35.960
How's Barrett?

1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.760
He's pretty tweaked.

1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:41.080
I don't think
he's gonna race the second heat.

1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:47.760
You ever thought
about putting the stock pipe back on?

1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:50.080
Well, I mean,
this track is mostly straight,

1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:51.640
so this aftermarket pipe
has great bottom,

1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:54.440
but you don't really have to worry
about that here.

1:14:54.520 --> 1:14:56.280
Just make sure you change the jets.

1:14:58.200 --> 1:14:59.640
That's not a bad idea.

1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:06.800
That's pretty amazing.
(CLEARS THROAT)

1:15:06.880 --> 1:15:10.000
You know, how you knew
about the bike like that.

1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:12.160
Yeah, well, I grew up around racing.

1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:15.000
Yeah. So did my girlfriend,

1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:17.560
but she doesn't know
a head pipe from a brake pad.

1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:21.040
I'll definitely be talking to you soon,
<i>Monsieur</i> Henderson.

1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:26.000
Yeah. Well, I hope that works out for you.

1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:28.600
Thanks. Bye.

1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:32.880
Dean. Dean, what are you staring at?

1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:36.280
I feel like I know her somehow.

1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:39.960
What were you talking
to Art Henderson about?

1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:44.160
-Don't walk away from me.
-Please take your hands off of me.

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:46.640
What were you
in the Hendersons' trailer for?

1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:48.800
It's none of your business. Now back off.

1:15:48.880 --> 1:15:50.200
Look, okay, I'm not gonna back off.

1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:52.480
You may have my father fooled,
but I know exactly what you're about,

1:15:52.560 --> 1:15:53.920
so once again, I'm gonna ask you...

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.040
What's going on?

1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:56.880
I caught him in the Hendersons' trailer.

1:15:56.960 --> 1:15:58.320
It looked like they were making
some kind of deal.

1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:01.040
I just thought it might be nice to see
how a real team operates,

1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:02.920
so he was showing me around their trailer.
That's all.

1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:04.760
Oh, please. You are so making that up.

1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:06.600
I know for a fact
that Art Henderson doesn't do that.

1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:10.800
Andrea, we have no reason to believe
Rene is lying about something like that.

1:16:10.920 --> 1:16:11.960
RENE: Of course you don't,

1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:14.480
and I resent being treated
like some sort of a criminal.

1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.120
He's a snake, Dad,
and I was just trying to help.

1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:22.480
-If you want to help, go apologize to him.
-Apologize?

1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:24.160
Honey, we need him to focus.

1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:26.840
He's never gonna be able to
if he's all worked up like this.

1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:29.040
I'll see you back at the truck.

1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:30.640
(SCOFFS)

1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:40.080
Aren't you the one who always said

1:16:40.200 --> 1:16:42.960
that if something barks like a dog
and scratches like a dog,

1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:45.480
it probably has fleas like a dog?

1:16:47.040 --> 1:16:49.800
Well, that boy is one big spoiled puppy
if you ask me.

1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:53.000
I'll fully back you up on that, Mom.

1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:58.440
Jason, why don't you check and see
if the gas is mixed for the next race?

1:16:59.280 --> 1:17:01.080
Man, I never get any respect.

1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:07.000
Edward, I love you,
and I will stand by you

1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:10.280
until the world comes to an end,
which it may very well do today,

1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:13.360
but you are making a gigantic mistake.

1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:16.480
Geneva, do you really want to get
into this right now?

1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:23.280
Okay, look. If somebody asked you
to describe your daughter,

1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:24.400
what would you say?

1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:28.120
Well, she's beautiful and smart.

1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:31.960
She gets along with just about everybody.

1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:34.160
"She gets along with
just about everybody."

1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:35.720
Hmm.

1:17:36.400 --> 1:17:40.160
If you won't listen to us, will you listen
to what you just said yourself?

1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:49.720
(SIGHS)

1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:57.720
-Don't feel bad, Dad.
-Yeah. She broke me, too.

1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:07.040
Look, all I'm trying to do
is help my family out, okay?

1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:08.920
Your family? Your family is a joke.

1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:11.560
Now, I am warning you for the last time,
stay out of my face.

1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:14.240
-Hey. Hey. You okay?
-Dad, I'm just trying to apologize.

1:18:14.320 --> 1:18:16.640
Wait here. Wait here. Hey, Cartier.

1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:19.920
Look, I'm sorry,
but I cannot accept her apology.

1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.600
Yeah? Well, that's okay,
because it's been withdrawn.

1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:27.920
By the way, you are fired.

1:18:33.200 --> 1:18:34.720
Dad, I was a jerk.

1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:40.840
No, you weren't. You were trying to help.
You were doing a great job, by the way.

1:18:41.840 --> 1:18:43.960
-Really?
-Really.

1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:49.040
You know, no matter what you might think,
when your mom and I were married

1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:52.800
and we started thinking about kids,
I always prayed for a girl.

1:18:54.280 --> 1:18:55.960
-You did?
-Yep.

1:18:56.960 --> 1:18:59.760
-I always thought that because...
-Of the racing and everything?

1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:06.000
-Well, yeah.
-Well, it was pretty much the opposite.

1:19:06.520 --> 1:19:09.600
When I was racing and I got hurt,
and I saw a lot of my friends get hurt,

1:19:09.680 --> 1:19:11.520
I swore I'd never let my kids
go through that,

1:19:11.600 --> 1:19:16.600
and I thought if we had a girl,
that'd never be a problem.

1:19:17.880 --> 1:19:21.080
-And then me came along.
-Yeah, you did.

1:19:22.520 --> 1:19:25.280
Funny thing is, when you have kids,
no matter what you'd hoped for,

1:19:25.360 --> 1:19:27.400
you're just so happy they're there
and that they're healthy,

1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:28.840
you forget everything else.

1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:32.320
I guess I always held on to the hope
that you'd be the one that'd be spared

1:19:32.400 --> 1:19:34.800
any of the pain or disappointment
that comes with this.

1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:38.200
Dad, but that's part of it.
I mean, if it wasn't for the bad stuff,

1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:39.920
it wouldn't make winning so great.

1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:44.880
You know, I never thought I'd say this,
but if it wasn't for you and your mother,

1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:48.000
there's no way Carson Racing
would have gotten this far.

1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:50.640
I'm very proud of you.

1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:55.040
I just wish that I could change
what happened to Andrew, Dad.

1:19:55.120 --> 1:19:56.400
I wish that it was me.

1:19:56.760 --> 1:20:01.280
Don't even think that.
You're our only hope. We need you healthy.

1:20:13.560 --> 1:20:16.440
-Are we ready to go racing?
-Mom told me you fired Rene.

1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:19.240
-Everything's almost loaded.
-Well, let's unload it.

1:20:19.320 --> 1:20:22.600
There's still one Carson left
who can bring this thing home.

1:20:23.640 --> 1:20:24.880
Yeah!

1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:30.640
Oh, shoot. I took the top end
out of the practice bike,

1:20:30.720 --> 1:20:32.800
and I haven't put it back
in the race bike yet.

1:20:33.120 --> 1:20:34.680
We won't have time now.

1:20:35.120 --> 1:20:38.560
Oh, how quickly you all give up.

Hey, show them
what real speed's all about, okay?

1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:40.760
Remember, don't take your helmet off
when they interview you on the podium.

1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:42.600
Well, if I'm being you,
who are you gonna be?

1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:46.080
Me? I'm just gonna be
another face in the crowd.

1:21:46.160 --> 1:21:47.200
Are you ready to go?

and things are smelling a lot better
around our rig.

1:22:08.920 --> 1:22:10.320
Yeah. It got dumped on our front lawn.

1:22:10.640 --> 1:22:12.680
Hey, so, I wanted to ask you
about your sister.

1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:14.800
What about her?

1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:16.920
Is she, like, dating anybody?

1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:18.680
You know, because if she isn't,
I was just wondering...

1:22:18.760 --> 1:22:21.240
Dude, you have a girlfriend, okay?
Remember?

1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:23.320
Man, we realized
we don't have anything in common.

1:22:23.400 --> 1:22:26.040
Besides, I think she has something
for French guys, anyway.

1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:27.720
So, what about it, huh?

1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:31.120
I'll talk to her.
She is pretty picky, though.

1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:32.840
Dude, come on. We're bros. Hook me up.

1:22:32.920 --> 1:22:35.400
Tell you what. I'll think about it,

1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:38.000
and maybe we can work out
some kind of deal.

No, the real Andrew Carson.
He's right behind you.

I don't know what he's talking about.

Well, if you're Andrew Carson,
then who's that right there?

Andi. Andrea Carson.

1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:16.120
I knew it. I knew
there was something weird about that kid.

that you were a guy this whole time.

I mean,
she was just helping out our family.

1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:30.800
I trusted you. I mean, I told you stuff.

1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:35.960
She should be disqualified.
It's a joke. She's a girl.

1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:37.760
There's got to be something
in the rulebook about this.

1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:40.760
No, there's nothing.
I just read the rulebook again.

1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:43.800
There's not one thing
that says a girl can't race.

1:27:44.680 --> 1:27:48.360
What about having an unregistered rider
racing for you? What's it say about that?

1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:53.680
She registered Andi Carson.
This is Andrea Carson, Andi for short.

1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:58.240

a major motocross event?

1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:01.320
Amazing. It was a family win, though.

1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:03.520

put together my bike,

1:28:03.600 --> 1:28:05.000

1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:08.760
and my little brother Jason
did a full top-end rebuild between races.

1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:11.160

1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:13.080

Andi gonna be a full factory-sponsored
rider this time next year?

After everything this young woman did?

1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:40.000

kept her identity a secret?

1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:53.720

-Absolutely.

You don't think
we're just gonna hand it to you, do you?

Well, I thought, you know,
me being a champ...

1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:26.960
Twelve laps. You beat me, you get the job.
