* We finally got

00:23.457 --> 00:26.026
* Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.094 --> 00:28.662
* Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.729 --> 00:31.265
* Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.332 --> 00:33.867
* Just to get up that hill

00:33.934 --> 00:36.470

01:12.072 --> 01:13.674
Now let's measure
the other foot.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.376
Why? They're both
the same size.

01:15.443 --> 01:17.845
That's what most
people think.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.114
But if you want
each moccasin
to fit like a glove...

01:20.181 --> 01:22.583
Glove? I ain't planning
on wearing them
on my hands.

01:24.885 --> 01:28.789
Then I have everything
I need. You can go
back to work.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.525
Well, in that case, child,
maybe you better check
the other one.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.163
(PHONE RINGING)

01:36.997 --> 01:37.998
Would you get that,
Miss Jefferson?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.570
(PHONE RINGING)

01:42.636 --> 01:44.605
It ain't every day
I get a man at my feet.
I wanna enjoy it.

01:47.975 --> 01:52.846
Hello? Just a minute.
Alan, it's for you.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.215
Tell her he's busy.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.483
How do you know
it's a her?

01:55.549 --> 01:57.618
Who else calls him but
love-sick females?

01:58.986 --> 02:00.954
Alan, it's
Susan Rafferty.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.324
Oh, no. Not her.
That means two hours
on the phone.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.393
Would you mind
telling her I'm not here?

02:05.459 --> 02:08.061
Well, I'd rather not lie.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.129
I can fix that...

02:13.534 --> 02:15.303
Oh, Susan, I'm sorry.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.837
Alan stepped out.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.975
Yes, I'll tell him
you called as soon as
he gets back.

02:25.045 --> 02:27.415
Oh, Alan, Susan Rafferty
just called.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.719
Shoot. Sorry I
missed her.

02:34.655 --> 02:38.158
Hey, Weezy, I got some
great news. Hey, Florence,
start cleaning up this mess.

02:38.226 --> 02:41.128
That don't sound like
great news to me.

02:41.195 --> 02:44.698
If the rest of your body moved
as quick as your mouth, you'd
be the best maid in New York.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.535
What's the news, George?

02:47.601 --> 02:50.471
My bank is thinking
about putting me on
the Board of Directors.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.841
Oh, George,
that's wonderful!
Congratulations!

02:53.907 --> 02:56.377
Don't congratulate me
yet, Weezy. I still
gotta pass the test.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.945
What test?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.813
Well, Phil Taylor's test.
He'll be here any minute

02:59.880 --> 03:01.582
to see if I got
the proper qualifications.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.717
Proper qualifications?

03:03.784 --> 03:06.987
Well, you know, like a
well-dressed wife, expensive
apartment, a maid.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.957
Oh, man, it's true.
Money talks.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.759
Then I shouldn't be hearing
a word from you.

03:13.927 --> 03:18.632
Now get rid of this junk.
Weezy, put on that long
black dress I like.

03:18.699 --> 03:22.403
That's an evening gown.
It's only the middle
of the day.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.839
Well, we just close
the curtains.

03:25.906 --> 03:30.010
Do you really want Mr. Taylor
to think I sit around the
house in an evening gown?

03:30.077 --> 03:32.179
Why not? It's expensive,
ain't it?

03:32.246 --> 03:35.716
George, I refuse to help
you make a fool
of yourself.

03:35.783 --> 03:39.119
Oh, he don't need no help
with that.

03:39.186 --> 03:44.392
Florence, don't just sit
there uglying up the
place. Give Alan a hand!

03:44.458 --> 03:47.060
(DOORBELL RINGS)

03:47.127 --> 03:50.097
Oh, no,
that's Taylor! Florence,
get back here!

03:50.163 --> 03:51.231
I wish you'd make
up your mind.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.033
I'll get this.
You answer the door.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.268
(DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN)

03:54.335 --> 03:55.869
Hold it, Florence!
Not yet!

04:08.616 --> 04:10.951
Okay, Florence. Hold it!

04:11.018 --> 04:12.252
(DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN)

04:12.320 --> 04:13.454
Weezy, get out here!

04:19.560 --> 04:23.931
-Okay, Florence.
-Are you sure this time?

04:23.997 --> 04:27.435
Florence, open the door!
Smile!

04:29.803 --> 04:31.739
Oh, Florence, we thought there
was nobody home.

04:35.943 --> 04:39.012
-There ain't! See?
-George!

04:39.079 --> 04:41.449
Hi, Louise. Tom and I
wanted to know if you'd

04:41.515 --> 04:43.417
like to go to an
antique sale with us.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.520
She can't. She's gotta stay
here and meet Mr. Taylor.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.222
-Oh, thanks anyway, Helen.
-Who's Mr. Taylor?

04:49.289 --> 04:53.060
A man from George's bank.
George is being
considered for a position

04:53.126 --> 04:56.564
-on the bank's
Board of Directors.
-Board of Directors?

04:56.630 --> 04:59.833
Congratulations, George.
You're taking
a real step up.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.769
Thanks. Now why don't you
take a real step out?

05:03.371 --> 05:05.339
Come on, Tom.
Louise...

05:05.406 --> 05:07.174
Would you tell Alan
that if he gets hungry
later on,

05:07.240 --> 05:09.543
I made some cream puffs.
They're his favorite.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.712
Helen, if you're trying

05:11.779 --> 05:13.981
to bribe your son into
spending an occasional
evening with his parents,

05:14.047 --> 05:16.417
-the cream puffs
won't work.
-Why not?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.251
I already ate them.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.523
Too bad you can't join
us, Louise. There should

05:22.590 --> 05:24.392
be some great
buys at the sale.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.726
Helen, I promised we'd

05:25.793 --> 05:28.362
look at antiques.
I never said buy.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.330
-What was the last
word you said?
-Buy.

05:30.798 --> 05:31.832
Bye.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.871
George, the way you treat
the Willises, I'm
surprised they even

05:37.938 --> 05:42.209
-bother to come down here.
-Me, too. Ain't they ever
gonna learn?

05:42.275 --> 05:44.678
-George...
-Look, Weezy, it's just
they always catch me

05:44.745 --> 05:46.279
at the wrong time.
That's all.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.148
With you, that's any hour
of any day.

05:48.215 --> 05:50.551
-Florence...
-Twelve months a year.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.886
-Florence!
-Year in and year out.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.657
-Florence!
-(DOORBELL RINGS)

05:56.724 --> 06:01.294
-Damn those Willises!
Now what do you want?
-Pardon?

06:01.361 --> 06:04.131
Oh, I mean, uh, what do
you wanna be standing out
there in the hall for

06:04.197 --> 06:06.434
when you could be
standing inside?
Come in, Mr. Taylor.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.368
Well, thank you, George.

06:08.436 --> 06:11.939
Hey, this is my dearest
darling wife, Louise.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.308
-How do you do, Mr. Taylor?
-Oh, just call me Phil.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.511
-No need for formalities
there now.
-(GEORGE LAUGHS)

06:17.578 --> 06:19.246
In that case, Phil,
I'm Florence.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.852
Hi, Florence. How are you?

06:24.918 --> 06:26.787
Oh, I'm fine.
Mr. Jefferson's
a nervous wreck.

06:28.789 --> 06:32.025
I ain't nervous. Now go
fix Mr. drink a Taylor.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.765
Don't bother, George, I
can only stay a minute.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.601
-Oh, why don't you
have a seat?
-Well, thank you, thank you.

06:40.668 --> 06:44.572
Just relax, George.
No need to treat me
like somebody special.

06:44.638 --> 06:51.278
Oh, we know you're nobody
special. I mean, you are
special, but not to us.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.814
-Well, you know,
you're special like...
-George, don't be nervous.

06:53.881 --> 06:57.317
Now we're all your
friends down at
Central Fidelity Bank,

06:57.384 --> 07:00.854
and we're very proud of you.
You are a real success story.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.656
Well, I worked hard.

07:02.723 --> 07:06.093
You certainly have.
You built that one small
store into a thriving chain.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.895
Yeah, but I didn't do it
by myself.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.164
All those years, there was
somebody standing right by
my side. Standing by me

07:11.231 --> 07:15.268
all the way, no matter
how bad things got. I'm
telling you, if it wasn't

07:15.335 --> 07:17.204
for that, I never
would have made it.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.706
(DOORBELL RINGS)

07:18.772 --> 07:22.576
George, you don't have to
tell all that to Mr. Taylor.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.979
But it's true, Weezy.
Where would I be with out
Central Fidelity Bank?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.085
-Yeah?
-Hi.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.153
Oh, Debbie.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.988
-Hi, Daddy.
-Daddy?

07:35.055 --> 07:36.557
The people at the bank
told me you were
over here.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.959
Yeah. George, Louise,
this is my daughter,
Debbie.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.360
Debbie, Mr. and
Mrs. Jefferson.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.062
-Hello. How are you?
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.965
-Now I thought you
had plans.
-Well, I did. But I forgot

07:45.032 --> 07:47.034
-something important.
-What was that?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.136
Money. Could I borrow some?

07:49.202 --> 07:52.640
Uh, well, you know
bankers' policy. What do
you have for collateral?

07:53.774 --> 07:57.044
-How about a kiss?
-Here you go.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.313
How about two kisses?

08:00.380 --> 08:01.381
(SIGHING)

08:02.650 --> 08:04.552
-Okay.
-Thanks.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.320
Excuse me. Has anybody
seen a needle lying
around out here?

08:07.387 --> 08:08.989
I left it while I was...

08:10.791 --> 08:11.792
Hello.

08:13.761 --> 08:17.831
Alan, this is
Debbie Taylor.
And her father, Mr...

08:17.898 --> 08:20.200
-Oh, just call me Phil.
-Pleased to meet you,
Phil.

08:21.769 --> 08:28.141
-Well, I guess I better
get going.
-Already? We just met.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.879
I wanted to get
to the craft fair before
everything's picked over.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.414
-The craft fair?
What do you make?
-Uh-huh.

08:34.481 --> 08:38.518
-Jewelry. I, uh,
made my necklace.
-Very pretty.

08:38.586 --> 08:43.123
-Thank you.
-The necklace is great,
too. Listen, I was going

08:43.190 --> 08:45.793
to the craft fair myself
to get some leather
supplies. Would you mind

08:45.859 --> 08:48.862
-if I went along with you?
-Oh, I'd love
some company.

08:48.929 --> 08:53.166
Super. Let's go. Oh, and
a real pleasure meeting
you, Phil.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.501
Well, right.

08:54.568 --> 08:55.603
-Bye.
-See you.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.204
-Bye.
-All right, have a nice
time.

08:57.270 --> 09:01.174
Well, that Alan seems
like a very nice
young man.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.211
Oh, yeah, they don't come
no nicer than him. That's
why we love having him

09:04.277 --> 09:07.648
-staying here.
Right, Weez?
-Oh, he lives here?

09:07.715 --> 09:11.184
Yeah. His parents live
upstairs. See, but Alan's
father was always

09:11.251 --> 09:14.588
fighting with him,
and Alan decided to split.
So I stepped in and

09:14.655 --> 09:16.657
suggested he move in with us
until they patched things up.

09:16.724 --> 09:20.327
Well, George, that shows
a lot of understanding
on your part.

09:20.393 --> 09:25.065
-Oh, there's nobody more
understanding than me.
-Well, I'm certainly glad

09:25.132 --> 09:27.801
that I came over to see
you. We're going to put
your name at a vote

09:27.868 --> 09:32.005
at the meeting this Tuesday.
You know, I shouldn't be
telling you this,

09:32.072 --> 09:36.343
but in my opinion,
you have everything that
we're looking for.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.112
-I think that we'll be
seeing a lot of each other.
-Great.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.082
And I have a hunch that
Debbie's gonna be seeing
a lot of Alan, too.

09:42.149 --> 09:46.086
-(LAUGHING) Yeah...
-Yeah, they seemed to hit
it off real well.

09:46.153 --> 09:49.422
-Well, I'll be seeing you,
George. Bye, Louise.
-LOUISE: Bye-bye!

09:49.489 --> 09:52.325
-Well, hey, I did it...
-(LOUISE LAUGHING)

09:53.694 --> 09:54.695
Florence!

09:55.495 --> 09:56.997
Yeah?

09:57.064 --> 09:59.499
Give me some champagne.
Weezy, do you believe it?

09:59.566 --> 10:02.069
-I'm gonna be on
the Board of Directors!
-Uh, now, George,

10:02.135 --> 10:05.072
-it's not final.
-But you heard what the
man said.

10:05.138 --> 10:08.575
He said everything's in
my favor, including Alan.
Boy, that kid sure does

10:08.642 --> 10:11.078
have a way with the women,
don't he?
(LAUGHING)

10:11.144 --> 10:15.448
Well, maybe now that Alan's
helped you out, you will stop
calling him zebra.

10:15.515 --> 10:20.854
Yeah, well, we'll see.
Oh, no...
I forgot about that.

10:20.921 --> 10:24.157
-What's wrong?
-I just set that two-tone
turkey up with Taylor's

10:24.224 --> 10:25.225
all white daughter!

10:27.460 --> 10:29.296
-So what?
-So what, Weezy?

10:29.362 --> 10:32.800
Look, Alan is 50% black
and 50% white.
Which adds up to

10:32.866 --> 10:36.003
100% trouble for me when
Taylor finds out. Damn!

10:36.069 --> 10:38.972
-There goes my
Board of Directors.
-Here's your champagne.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.541
-I don't want no
champagne. Get rid of it.
-You're the boss.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.578
Damn! Damn!

10:55.188 --> 10:57.190
Look! It's almost 5:00.
Where can they be?

10:57.257 --> 10:59.192
-Relax, George.
-Weezy, I can't relax as

10:59.259 --> 11:02.395
long as Alan's out with
Taylor's daughter! Ow!

11:05.532 --> 11:07.367
What's the matter?

11:07.434 --> 11:10.003
-I just found
Alan's needle.
-Well, I'm going upstairs

11:10.070 --> 11:13.774
-to see if Tom and Helen
are home yet.
-My only chance of getting

11:13.841 --> 11:15.909
on that Board of Directors
now is keeping
Taylor from finding out

11:15.976 --> 11:18.946
about Alan until after
Tuesday's meeting.

11:19.012 --> 11:22.883
George, I think you're wrong
about Mr. Taylor. He doesn't
seem like a bigot.

11:22.950 --> 11:26.086
Weezy, we're not talking
about bigots! We're
talking about zebras!

11:29.122 --> 11:32.359
I just hope Alan ain't
showed his true stripes
to Debbie yet.

11:34.995 --> 11:39.699
Hut, two, three, four.
Company, halt!

11:41.068 --> 11:43.503
Where on Earth
did you get that?

11:43.570 --> 11:45.705
We got it at the craft fair.
Isn't it trippy?

11:45.773 --> 11:47.841
-Hey, Alan.
-Well, if you'll excuse me,

11:47.908 --> 11:50.744
-I'm on my way up
to see your parents.
-Oh, Alan, I'd love

11:50.811 --> 11:53.580
-to meet them.
-(LAUGHING) Oh no,
you wouldn't.

11:53.646 --> 11:56.049
Well, there's plenty
of time for that. First, I
wanna hear all about

11:56.116 --> 12:00.320
your afternoon. Come on in
the kitchen, Alan. Uh, hey,
oh, oh wait a minute.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.023
-I wanna
speak to Alan alone.
-Why?

12:03.090 --> 12:06.126
Well, I want you to make
Debbie one of your
special protein drinks.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.696
-You'll love it.
-Oh...
Be right back!

12:11.999 --> 12:15.235
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

12:15.302 --> 12:19.039
-Well, how'd your
afternoon go with Debbie?
-Fine.

12:19.106 --> 12:23.811
Oh. Four hours, huh?
Boy, that's a lot to spend
with somebody.

12:23.877 --> 12:27.114
-You two must have done
a lot of talking, huh?
-Yeah, I guess.

12:27.180 --> 12:30.050
-Oh, do you want one of these?
-No, I hate health drinks.
They make me sick.

12:32.519 --> 12:36.356
-Did you find out
much about her?
-Well, yeah.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.793
-Did she find out much
about you?
-(LAUGHING) What is this?

12:39.860 --> 12:43.330
-Twenty questions?
-Hey, look, I just wanna
know about your friends,

12:43.396 --> 12:46.399
that's all. I mean, like
with most people you can
tell all about them

12:46.466 --> 12:49.602
the minute you see them.
Like if a guy walked in here
right now, with feathers

12:49.669 --> 12:53.140
in his hair, and paint all
all over his face, you'd know
right away he was an Indian.

12:53.206 --> 12:57.210
Or a rock star.
Or Steve Martin. Or...

12:57.277 --> 13:00.513
Look here, for example,
take you. Now a lot of
people wouldn't know what

13:00.580 --> 13:03.683
-you were unless
you told them.
-That I'm Taurus the bull?

13:03.750 --> 13:06.920
No, no. That you're Alan
the ze... You know.

13:09.923 --> 13:13.026
I mean, that's you're
black and white.

13:13.093 --> 13:16.596
Yeah, I guess you're
right. Nobody would know
that unless I told them.

13:17.497 --> 13:21.034
(WHISTLING)

13:21.101 --> 13:25.472
-Did you tell Debbie?
-No. It never even
occurred to me.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.341
But if you think it might
make a difference to her,
I'll tell her right now.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.409
Hold it!

13:34.447 --> 13:37.317
-Ugh. Thanks.
-I thought you didn't
like that?

13:37.384 --> 13:41.588
Well, it just looked so
good. I'll take Debbie
her drink, you make

13:41.654 --> 13:42.689
another one for yourself,
okay?

13:47.127 --> 13:50.430
Debbie, nice meeting you.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.132
Stop in and see
us again sometime.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.068
-But I thought Alan
was going to...
-Yeah, I know.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.070
-He decided to make dinner
for Weezy and me.
-Huh?

13:57.137 --> 14:00.773
Yeah, an old great big
20-pound roast. He'll be in
the kitchen for hours.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.310
-Well, should I at least
say goodbye?
-Okay. Goodbye.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.347
I don't understand.
Is Alan trying to get
rid of me?

14:07.414 --> 14:09.382
Well, no, it's just that
I, I mean, uh...

14:09.449 --> 14:11.284
He doesn't
want to upset your father.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.720
Daddy? But what does
Daddy have to do
with this?

14:13.786 --> 14:18.892
Everything. Look, believe me,
Alan just feels that you two
ain't right for each other.

14:18.959 --> 14:22.229
Live and learn. Well,
there are a lot more
fish in the sea.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.798
-Sure there are. Bye.
-Goodbye.

14:26.967 --> 14:27.968
Phew.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.003
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

14:31.771 --> 14:32.772
Where's Debbie?

14:33.340 --> 14:34.374
She split.

14:37.577 --> 14:42.615
-Split? Why?
-Who knows with chicks
these days?

14:42.682 --> 14:45.618
-Well, didn't she even
say anything?
-Yeah. She said goodbye.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.422
-Just like that?
-Yeah.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.560
Well, like I always say,
live and learn. Mmm.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.863
But there are a lot
more fish on the beach.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.635
Too bad about Debbie
running out like that.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.772
Well, you win some,
you lose some.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.374
Most of mine get rained out.

15:09.943 --> 15:13.913
-Well, your parents still
aren't home yet.
-Oh, I guess I'll get

15:13.981 --> 15:16.116
to work on your
moccasins, Florence.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.952
(DOORBELL RINGS)

15:23.323 --> 15:24.324
You're closer.

15:30.964 --> 15:35.168
-Oh, Mr. Taylor,
what a surprise.
-Now, now, it's Phil.

15:35.235 --> 15:40.007
-Is George home?
-Florence, would you tell
Mr. Jefferson Phil's here?

15:40.073 --> 15:42.642
(SHOUTING)
Sure. Mr. Jefferson,
Phil's here!

15:45.878 --> 15:49.416
-Oh, come in and sit down.
-Thank you, thank you.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.950
Uh, we weren't expecting

15:51.018 --> 15:54.521
-to see you so soon.
I hope nothing's wrong.
-Oh, no, no. No, I just

15:54.587 --> 15:57.257
thought I'd stop by
and ask George
a few questions.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.026
-Oh...
-Hey, Phil,
how's it going?

15:59.092 --> 16:04.397
-Oh, uh, fine, fine.
Listen, could we talk?
-Sure, Phil.

16:09.202 --> 16:12.639
-Florence, they
want to talk.
-I ain't gonna interrupt.

16:13.940 --> 16:14.974
Come with me.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.519
What's on your
mind, Phil?

16:26.586 --> 16:30.090
Well, George, Debbie
tells me that you don't

16:30.157 --> 16:34.127
-want her to see
Alan anymore.
-Did I say that?

16:34.194 --> 16:38.098
-She said it had
something to do with me.
-Oh, yeah, well, in a way

16:38.165 --> 16:40.800
-it does.
-Uh-huh. George,
if there's one thing

16:40.867 --> 16:44.871
we believe in down
at the bank, it's in
being straightforward.

16:44.937 --> 16:49.342
Yeah, well, um, sometimes
people ain't always what
they seem. Like if I was

16:49.409 --> 16:51.244
-a friend of yours...
-Uh-huh...

16:51.311 --> 16:52.879
And there was something
about you that you didn't
tell me about...

16:52.945 --> 16:55.448
-Uh-huh.
-Well, it would change
my opinion.

16:55.515 --> 17:00.153
Uh-huh. George, are you
trying to tell me somebody's
hiding something?

17:00.220 --> 17:03.190
-Exactly.
-And it isn't Debbie?

17:03.256 --> 17:08.095
-Right.
-All right, Jefferson, if
you are talking about

17:08.161 --> 17:10.830
those embezzled
securities that turned up
in my Swiss account,

17:10.897 --> 17:12.499
the grand jury said that
I was innocent.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.942
No, I wasn't talking
about no
embezzled securities.

17:23.009 --> 17:25.712
Oh, then it was the
phony insurance scheme.

17:25.778 --> 17:29.249
Well, George,
that wasn't my idea.

17:29.316 --> 17:32.285
Insurance scheme?
No, I wasn't talking
about that either.

17:32.352 --> 17:36.123
-Then what the hell are
you talking about?
-Look, I'm talking about

17:36.189 --> 17:37.924
-blacks and whites.
-Uh-huh.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.026
There are some people
who believe that they
shouldn't be together.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.995
Oh, and you were afraid

17:43.062 --> 17:47.500
that I might be
prejudice? Oh well,
George, you can put that

17:47.567 --> 17:49.969
thought out of your mind.
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

17:50.036 --> 17:53.406
(LAUGHING)
No, no, we're all
the same underneath.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.442
Then you don't mind
blacks and whites
being mixed.

17:55.508 --> 17:58.678
Mind? No, I think
it's about time we got
the two together, don't you?

17:59.312 --> 18:02.014
Yeah! Yes.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.417
-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-Hey, Phil,
you're okay. You know,

18:04.484 --> 18:06.419
it's gonna be an honor
being on the Board
of Directors with you.

18:06.486 --> 18:09.156
Oh, well, thank you. Now
that you think I'm okay,

18:09.222 --> 18:12.859
-then Debbie and Alan
can go out again?
-Yeah, sure. Why not?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.261
(BOTH LAUGH)

18:15.695 --> 18:17.630
Oh, before you throw us
out again, could we
see Louise?

18:17.697 --> 18:21.668
-Tom! Helen!
-We wanna show her this
clock we bought at the

18:21.734 --> 18:23.670
-antique sale.
-But we'll come
back later.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.439
Later? Are you kidding?
Come in, come in,
come in, come in!

18:28.608 --> 18:33.646
Phil Taylor, these are my two
good friends, Tom and
Helen Willis.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.583
-Oh, Tom, Helen.
-Hello.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.685
Don't they make a
handsome couple?

18:42.054 --> 18:43.190
Did I hear the Will...

18:44.624 --> 18:48.428
-I don't believe it.
-Ain't this a nice surprise?

18:48.495 --> 18:52.432
-Well, it sure is.
-Now that we're all here,
how about a drink?

18:52.499 --> 18:53.666
I'll get some ice.
(LAUGHING)

18:57.470 --> 18:59.639
Oh, look at this clock
we bought, Louise.

18:59.706 --> 19:04.177
-Oh, it's beautiful.
-My, what a lovely old
face. It's wrinkled,

19:04.244 --> 19:07.314
-but it has
a lot of character.
-Yes, I bought it because

19:07.380 --> 19:08.681
it reminded me
of Helen's mother.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.085
Her mother has a
clock just like that.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.155
-Hello, Phil.
-Oh, hi, Alan.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.357
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, honey.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.158
-Hello, son.
-Hi, Dad.

19:26.533 --> 19:31.271
-These are your parents?
-Yes. Well, haven't
you met?

19:31.338 --> 19:34.073
Well, yes. But George
didn't tell me this
was your father

19:34.140 --> 19:36.042
and... Step-mother.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.513
I'm not Alan's
step-mother.

19:40.580 --> 19:46.052
Oh, I see. Well, I think
adoption is wonderful.

19:46.118 --> 19:49.289
No, no, no. You don't
understand, Mr. Taylor.
Alan's not adopted.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.225
No kidding.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.463
No kidding.

19:56.529 --> 20:01.401
Will you excuse me for a
moment? I'll see if I can
help George with the ice.

20:03.670 --> 20:07.440
Listen, George, about
Alan's parents...

20:07.507 --> 20:09.976
-Yeah, I know. Ain't they
a great couple?
-Oh, yeah, they're great.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.945
Great. (STAMMERING)
But about Alan and Debbie...

20:13.012 --> 20:16.048
Yeah, they're a great couple,
too. Hey, look, we gotta get
those two back together.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.984
Oh, no, actually, George,
(STAMMERING) I think that we

20:18.050 --> 20:22.221
ought to let well enough
alone. I mean, I really
don't think that Debbie

20:22.289 --> 20:27.727
-and Alan are right
for each other.
-You don't?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.128
No.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.965
-(LAUGHING) Neither do I.
-Oh, good.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.367
Wait, wait a minute.

20:36.369 --> 20:41.207
Oh, that's why you didn't want
Debbie to go out with Alan.

20:41.274 --> 20:45.312
-(BOTH LAUGHING)
-You knew about
Alan's parents.

20:47.414 --> 20:50.717
I didn't think you'd want your
daughter hanging around with
Alan. I know what it's like.

20:50.783 --> 20:55.422
-My own son is
married to a zebra.
-A zebra?

20:55.488 --> 20:57.357
Yeah, you know.
Half-black and
half-white.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.959
-Oh, no kidding?
-Yeah, but it ain't no
problem with her,

21:00.026 --> 21:01.361
'cause her white
don't show through.

21:03.730 --> 21:07.133
Well, George, I certainly
appreciate what you
tried to do for me.

21:07.199 --> 21:10.803
-Hey, no problem, old buddy.
-Yeah. You know, it's a

21:10.870 --> 21:13.773
good thing I found out
before Debbie did. You
know how kids are these days.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.108
If I had told
Debbie I didn't want her
going out with Alan

21:16.175 --> 21:21.113
because he's black, she'd
keep going out with him
just to spite me, right?

21:21.180 --> 21:26.285
-What do you mean
because Alan's black?
-Well, his mother's black.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.755
I know. But the bad part
is his father is white.

21:31.391 --> 21:34.126
Oh, George, you
know what I mean.

21:34.193 --> 21:37.196
I mean, if Debbie
and Alan kept going
together, some day they

21:37.263 --> 21:40.333
got married, see, they
could have a black baby.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.535
Oh, and what's wrong
with a black baby?

21:44.904 --> 21:48.741
Well, um, nothing,
if you are black.

21:48.808 --> 21:53.946
-See if your son had a kid
and it was black, that's fine.
-And if it was white?

21:54.013 --> 21:58.117
Well, if it's white
you're a few points ahead.
But if my daughter

21:58.184 --> 22:01.020
-had a black baby...
-Oh, you're trying to tell
me that your daughter is

22:01.087 --> 22:02.655
too good to have
a black baby?

22:02.722 --> 22:05.725
George, look, I'm
as liberal as anybody.
But there are limits.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.427
Like what, honkey?

22:11.864 --> 22:15.602
We Taylors are a very old
and prominent fam...

22:15.668 --> 22:20.339
What did you call me?

22:20.407 --> 22:25.812
I called you a honkey.
A two-faced honkey who's
too dumb to realize that

22:25.878 --> 22:29.582
-black is beautiful.
-I think I better leave.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.551
Wait a minute, Taylor.

22:31.618 --> 22:34.587
-You ain't leaving.
I'm throwing you out.
-What's wrong, George?

22:34.654 --> 22:38.224
-This honkey just showed
his true colors.
-Hey, don't listen

22:38.290 --> 22:41.694
-to him, Phil. He's...
-Mr. Taylor to you, boy!

22:41.761 --> 22:43.229
Who are you calling boy?

22:43.863 --> 22:44.964
Right on, baby.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.040
Let me handle
this, Willis.

22:54.106 --> 22:57.544
Look, chump. Alan
won't be seeing your
daughter no more.

22:57.610 --> 23:00.547
Not because it's the way
you want it, but that's
because the way I want it.

23:00.613 --> 23:03.950
He's too good to get mixed
up in your jive, blue-blooded
family. Now get out.

23:04.016 --> 23:06.252
That's fine, Jefferson.
But you can forget about

23:06.318 --> 23:09.789
getting on our Board, or
any other Board, for that
matter, except for

23:09.856 --> 23:13.626
the ironing board at that
lousy laundry of yours!

23:13.693 --> 23:17.697
Oh, this guy's hot under the
collar, huh? Maybe I should
cool him off!

(ALAN LAUGHING)

23:39.786 --> 23:43.255
Oh, George, I'm so proud
of you!

23:43.322 --> 23:45.925
Sometimes you can be a very
noble person.

23:45.992 --> 23:48.595
I knew deep down inside
you really liked Alan.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.831
Yeah, thanks, Mr. Jefferson,
for standing
up for me like that.

23:51.898 --> 23:55.702
Look, man, don't get no ideas.
I only stand up for part of
you, the black part.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.807
Well, that's still better
than nothing.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.042
Give me some skin, brother!

24:05.645 --> 24:06.679
Half-a-brother.

24:40.713 --> 24:45.685
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
