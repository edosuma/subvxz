00:24.342 --> 00:27.592
(peaceful organ music)

00:34.730 --> 00:38.063
(melancholy jazz music)

03:09.981 --> 03:10.814
- Stop it.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.204
Stop.

03:21.939 --> 03:22.909
(grunts)

03:22.909 --> 03:24.880
(screams)

03:24.880 --> 03:25.713
No!

03:25.713 --> 03:28.046
No! (yelps)

03:33.376 --> 03:35.376
(pants)

03:39.656 --> 03:44.656
(birds tweet)
(distant dog barks)

03:52.911 --> 03:54.911
(sighs)

04:14.694 --> 04:16.694
(sighs)

04:22.292 --> 04:25.042
(lighter flicks)

04:46.025 --> 04:48.108
(sniffs)

04:49.393 --> 04:52.226
(plastic rustles)

05:23.973 --> 05:26.223
(brushing)

05:29.741 --> 05:32.574
(glove box slams)

05:33.563 --> 05:36.396
(breathes deeply)

05:40.732 --> 05:43.732
(suspenseful music)

05:48.993 --> 05:51.030
(screams)

05:51.030 --> 05:51.947
God damnit!

06:08.646 --> 06:10.646
(sighs)

06:35.201 --> 06:37.232
- Get out of the car!
(tense music)

06:37.232 --> 06:41.469
- Fuck out!
- Shit, shit! (screams)

06:41.469 --> 06:43.719
- Get out!
- Get out, freak!

06:46.009 --> 06:46.927
- Get out!

06:46.927 --> 06:49.687
- Stop it!
- Get out of your car, freak!

06:49.687 --> 06:51.238
- Leave me alone!

06:51.238 --> 06:53.558
- You kids! Leave that man alone!

06:53.558 --> 06:54.709
- [Josh] Fuck you, lady!

06:54.709 --> 06:56.279
- Okay!
- What's wrong with you?

06:56.279 --> 06:58.446
- Get the hell outta here!

07:03.108 --> 07:05.709
(Harold pants)

07:05.709 --> 07:07.938
(knocks)

07:07.938 --> 07:09.520
Hal?

07:09.520 --> 07:10.353
It's me.

07:12.370 --> 07:14.469
- Are they gone?
- Yeah.

07:14.469 --> 07:17.052
(Harold pants)

07:18.869 --> 07:23.307
- Thanks, Miss Rita. I
thought I was gonna die.

07:23.307 --> 07:25.599
- Sorry about that, Hal.

07:25.599 --> 07:29.529
These little bastards,
they out of control.

07:29.529 --> 07:31.707
(Harold sighs)

07:31.707 --> 07:33.741
You know, you wasn't nothin' like that

07:33.741 --> 07:36.359
when you was a kid, Hal.

07:36.359 --> 07:39.128
You was the sweetest little boy.

07:39.128 --> 07:42.347
Your momma was so proud of you.

07:42.347 --> 07:45.804
She move in here with you
kids, fix up that old house,

07:45.804 --> 07:50.804
said she was gonna meal-you-ate
the neighborhood. (chuckles)

07:51.928 --> 07:56.261
And I told her she ain't
had nothin' to worry about.

07:58.900 --> 08:02.619
You okay, Hal? You don't look good.

08:02.619 --> 08:05.109
- I'm sorry. I'm, I'm fine.

08:05.109 --> 08:05.942
I'm okay.

08:07.027 --> 08:08.937
- You got a list for me?

08:08.937 --> 08:10.270
- [Harold] Yeah.

08:15.459 --> 08:18.660
- I don't see no cold drinks on here.

08:18.660 --> 08:21.900
You want me to bring you some
of them orange ones you like?

08:21.900 --> 08:23.238
- Yes, please.

08:23.238 --> 08:25.919
- All right, I'll be back with this later.

08:25.919 --> 08:27.419
- [Harold] Thanks.

08:52.128 --> 08:55.128
(muffled trickling)

09:08.378 --> 09:11.128
(urine splashes)

09:33.420 --> 09:36.503
(somber piano music)

09:41.400 --> 09:44.038
- [Jacob] You're not my real dad!

09:44.038 --> 09:44.880
- Shut the fuck up.

09:44.880 --> 09:48.388
Don't you ever talk to me that way!

09:48.388 --> 09:50.598
Oh, come on, big man.

09:50.598 --> 09:52.107
Do it.

09:52.107 --> 09:53.638
Oh, give me an excuse!

09:53.638 --> 09:55.798
- [Josh] All I said is that
you're not my real dad.

09:55.798 --> 09:57.768
- [Randy] No, you're damn right I'm not.

09:57.768 --> 09:59.158
- He probably deserves it.

09:59.158 --> 09:59.991
- He left!

10:00.917 --> 10:02.787
He doesn't care about you.

10:02.787 --> 10:06.257
When your mom's not here,
that means I'm in charge.

10:06.257 --> 10:08.397
Oh and now you're gonna cry?

10:08.397 --> 10:10.367
(chuckles) Jesus Christ.

10:10.367 --> 10:11.534
Cry, cry, cry!

10:12.599 --> 10:13.599
What a baby.

10:15.836 --> 10:18.086
Get the hell out of my way.

10:20.218 --> 10:22.635
(door slams)

10:48.196 --> 10:51.113
(handbrake clicks)

11:01.618 --> 11:04.877
(Harold sniffs)

11:04.877 --> 11:07.877
(suspenseful music)

11:32.517 --> 11:34.151
- Hey!

11:34.151 --> 11:36.318
Is there someone in there?

11:37.750 --> 11:39.918
Please exit the vehicle, sir.

11:39.918 --> 11:41.790
- [Harold] Why?

11:41.790 --> 11:43.458
(knocks)

11:43.458 --> 11:45.375
- Roll the window down.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.546
- What do you want?
- Roll it down.

11:48.546 --> 11:50.796
- God damn police officers.

11:52.296 --> 11:55.596
Always harassin' people
who ain't doin' nothin'.

11:55.596 --> 11:58.037
- Please just leave me alone!
- Roll it down!

11:58.037 --> 11:58.870
- Officer!

12:00.757 --> 12:02.608
- Ma'am, I need you to stay back.

12:02.608 --> 12:05.668
- Listen to me, god damnit.

12:05.668 --> 12:06.501
(radio bleeps)

12:06.501 --> 12:07.378
- I'm gonna need backup over here

12:07.378 --> 12:09.475
at Beinvenue and Tupaneaux.

12:09.475 --> 12:11.676
- You don't need no backup.

12:11.676 --> 12:13.087
- [Dispatch] Roger that.
Backup's on the way.

12:13.087 --> 12:16.239
- This man ain't right in the head.

12:16.239 --> 12:19.766
He's been locked in that car for months.

12:19.766 --> 12:22.183
Please, just cut him a break.

12:23.408 --> 12:25.075
I looks out for him.

12:25.968 --> 12:28.148
- [Harold] Yeah, please
just leave me alone.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.107
I'm not hurting anyone.

12:30.107 --> 12:32.366
- What do you mean you "look out for him"?

12:32.366 --> 12:36.283
- His papa died and it
mess him up in the head.

12:37.864 --> 12:40.836
He's scared to get out the car.

12:40.836 --> 12:41.747
- Just go away.

12:41.747 --> 12:45.108
- When I first found him, he
was in there for five days,

12:45.108 --> 12:47.275
with no food and no water.

12:48.234 --> 12:49.651
He's almost dead.

12:51.868 --> 12:55.683
I promised his momma I
would take care of him.

12:55.683 --> 12:57.148
- Just go, dude.

12:57.148 --> 12:58.805
- [Willie] How long has he been in there?

12:58.805 --> 13:02.555
- I don't know. Five months, four months?

13:02.555 --> 13:04.853
- And you take care of him?

13:04.853 --> 13:06.410
- Yeah.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.243
I do.

13:09.370 --> 13:10.423
(radio bleeps)

13:10.423 --> 13:14.002
- Listen, cancel that backup. False alarm.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.271
- [Dispatch] 10-4, canceling backup.

13:16.271 --> 13:17.271
- All right.

13:18.945 --> 13:22.171
Look, I'm glad you take care of him,

13:22.171 --> 13:24.451
but it's illegal to live
in your car in this parish.

13:24.451 --> 13:26.111
He's got to go.

13:26.111 --> 13:29.402
And you can't just move
the car down the street.

13:29.402 --> 13:31.290
You're gonna have to get him some help.

13:31.290 --> 13:34.410
- [Rita] I'm doing the best I can.

13:34.410 --> 13:36.651
- My hands are tied.

13:36.651 --> 13:38.151
Y'all got 14 days.

13:39.903 --> 13:40.736
- Mm-hm.

13:44.202 --> 13:45.035
Hal!

13:48.733 --> 13:50.733
Look at this he gave us.

13:57.538 --> 13:59.446
He say 14 days. That's it.

13:59.446 --> 14:01.759
- I can't! I can't leave!

14:01.759 --> 14:03.859
- I know, baby, you ain't
doing nothing wrong,

14:03.859 --> 14:06.442
but he say you can't stay here.

14:14.390 --> 14:16.390
(sighs)

14:22.572 --> 14:25.322
(objects rattle)

14:30.880 --> 14:33.481
- [Harold] Shit. God damnit, kid.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.201
(pants)

14:35.201 --> 14:38.342
- What did that cop want?
- Leave me alone!

14:38.342 --> 14:42.842
Get the fuck outta here, kid! (pants)

14:51.014 --> 14:54.097
Fucking kid. (pants)

14:57.119 --> 14:59.952
(breathes deeply)

15:03.864 --> 15:05.683
(crickets chirp)

15:05.683 --> 15:09.350
(Rico whistles melodically)

15:12.954 --> 15:13.787
- Hey!

15:15.594 --> 15:16.935
(knocks)

15:16.935 --> 15:18.404
Har-Har.

15:18.404 --> 15:19.321
It's Ri-Ri!

15:20.604 --> 15:22.465
How you been, man?

15:22.465 --> 15:24.673
- [Harold] I've been all
right, man. How you doin'?

15:24.673 --> 15:25.756
- Doin' well.

15:27.382 --> 15:30.522
What you been getting into?
- Ah, nothin'.

15:30.522 --> 15:33.715
Damn kids were over here
earlier, beating on my car.

15:33.715 --> 15:36.622
Scared me half to fuckin' death.

15:36.622 --> 15:39.035
- We were just as bad when we were kids.

15:39.035 --> 15:42.425
We used to terrorize this
neighborhood. (chuckles)

15:42.425 --> 15:43.425
Beer?
- Sure.

15:46.155 --> 15:48.572
(can hisses)

15:49.876 --> 15:52.502
- Plus a cop came by, said
they're gonna tow my car.

15:52.502 --> 15:55.126
- We heard. That's why we came by.

15:55.126 --> 15:57.274
- "We"?
- Billy's coming.

15:57.274 --> 16:00.095
He should be here any second now.

16:00.095 --> 16:03.365
Can't we just pull it up the street?

16:03.365 --> 16:04.809
- Nah, they gave me a tow summons.

16:04.809 --> 16:05.967
Says I gotta get it off the street.

16:05.967 --> 16:08.759
They own the whole fuckin' thing.

16:08.759 --> 16:12.080
- I don't know anyone around
this neighborhood anymore.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.640
Did Miss Rita check with the neighbors?

16:14.640 --> 16:18.549
- Yeah, she asked a while
back. Everyone said no.

16:18.549 --> 16:19.977
They don't want a broke-down
car in their yard,

16:19.977 --> 16:23.069
much less a guy living in it.
(Rico chuckles)

16:23.069 --> 16:23.986
- I get it.

16:25.510 --> 16:27.843
How are you feeling tonight?

16:29.248 --> 16:32.539
- Jesus, man. Are you fucking serious?

16:32.539 --> 16:34.068
Intervention bullsh-

16:34.068 --> 16:35.480
- Hey! Come on, man!

16:35.480 --> 16:37.867
Hey, I'm not gonna go anywhere!

16:37.867 --> 16:40.858
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's up, buddy?

16:40.858 --> 16:43.691
He, uh, just rolled up his window.

16:44.527 --> 16:46.419
- (scoffs) Well, I thought
I told you to wait for me?

16:46.419 --> 16:47.989
Hey, Harold.
(knocks)

16:47.989 --> 16:49.937
- I didn't say anything.
(Billy sighs)

16:49.937 --> 16:50.770
- It's me.

16:51.847 --> 16:54.679
Come on, man. Roll down the window.

16:54.679 --> 16:56.697
(Harold sighs)

16:56.697 --> 16:58.747
Hey, well, I'm not leaving.

16:58.747 --> 17:02.560
- [Harold] Why can't
you assholes understand?

17:02.560 --> 17:04.577
- Well, we're just
gonna sit here and talk,

17:04.577 --> 17:07.148
have a few drinks and, uh...

17:07.148 --> 17:08.498
I don't know, if you feel comfortable,

17:08.498 --> 17:12.498
maybe you can hop out and
sit with us for a bit, huh?

17:12.498 --> 17:13.498
- Yeah, man.

17:14.656 --> 17:16.419
Come on, Har-Har.

17:16.419 --> 17:18.419
Be a puss-puss, Har-Har.

17:21.458 --> 17:22.375
Here he is.

17:23.678 --> 17:24.511
Aww.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.888
Come on, man.
- Hey, hey.

17:28.888 --> 17:32.209
Hey, I talked to Bonny. She's
coming in town tomorrow.

17:32.209 --> 17:35.218
She's worried about you. We all are.

17:35.218 --> 17:38.599
- [Harold] You think I would...
Y'all still don't get it!

17:38.599 --> 17:41.682
- [Rico] That's why we brought you...

17:43.011 --> 17:43.844
This.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.690
- [Billy] Yeah, come on, man,
with the tow truck coming,

17:47.690 --> 17:49.357
it's Hail Mary time.

17:50.481 --> 17:51.840
It's worth a shot.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.019
- [Rico] And talking about shots,

17:53.019 --> 17:55.686
I'm gonna serve you one, Harold!

18:05.173 --> 18:06.006
Thank you.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.229
- To family.

18:19.107 --> 18:20.107
- To family.

18:27.114 --> 18:29.486
(chuckles)

18:29.486 --> 18:30.319
Another.

18:34.269 --> 18:35.936
To tres good amigos.

18:37.468 --> 18:38.687
Salud.

18:38.687 --> 18:39.520
- Salud.

18:43.134 --> 18:46.175
(Harold coughs)
(Rico chuckles)

18:46.175 --> 18:48.675
- You're out of practice, huh?

18:50.215 --> 18:51.682
(chuckles) Do you guys remember

18:51.682 --> 18:54.273
when we streaked down to Melanie's house?

18:54.273 --> 18:56.123
(laughs)

18:56.123 --> 18:57.206
- Yeah, I do.

18:58.083 --> 19:01.085
I had the biggest crush on her, man.

19:01.085 --> 19:04.165
What was that, like 20 years ago?

19:04.165 --> 19:04.998
- 16.

19:06.104 --> 19:08.643
Come on, let's do some more.

19:08.643 --> 19:09.633
- Oh!

19:09.633 --> 19:10.466
Okay.

19:10.466 --> 19:11.813
- [Harold] Let me pour.

19:11.813 --> 19:13.896
- The Har-Har is pouring.

19:17.973 --> 19:20.890
Oh, oh! (chuckles)

19:22.070 --> 19:22.903
Okay.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.133
- To trying.

19:29.008 --> 19:32.341
- (chuckles) To trying.

19:35.295 --> 19:37.434
(grunts)

19:37.434 --> 19:38.934
- [Jenny] Asshole!

19:41.515 --> 19:43.663
- [Rico] That asshole is beating
up Jenny and Jacob again.

19:43.663 --> 19:46.165
- Jesus, is she still with that loser?

19:46.165 --> 19:48.170
- [Harold] He probably deserves it.

19:48.170 --> 19:49.751
- Who? The kid?

19:49.751 --> 19:52.209
- Well, he's always over
here, fucking with me.

19:52.209 --> 19:53.512
Him and his piece of shit friends

19:53.512 --> 19:56.821
were beating on my car earlier,
scared the shit outta me.

19:56.821 --> 19:57.654
- Yeah...

19:59.111 --> 20:03.430
(chuckles) You know I care about you.

20:03.430 --> 20:07.570
I gave the kids a couple
of bucks to do it.

20:07.570 --> 20:08.460
- Fuck?

20:08.460 --> 20:11.531
- I thought that if you
would get mad enough,

20:11.531 --> 20:13.560
you would get out of the fucking car!

20:13.560 --> 20:14.909
(Rico and Billy laugh)

20:14.909 --> 20:16.009
- Classic, man.

20:16.009 --> 20:19.888
- It was made out of pure
love. You know I love you.

20:19.888 --> 20:22.091
(blows kiss and chuckles)

20:22.091 --> 20:25.571
- Get the hell outta here!
- Scared me shitless.

20:25.571 --> 20:26.988
That's fucked up.

20:27.890 --> 20:31.223
- Get the hell outta here!
- I'm leaving.

20:32.662 --> 20:33.495
- Go!

20:34.691 --> 20:37.108
(car starts)

20:40.461 --> 20:41.294
- Yeah!

20:44.902 --> 20:46.589
- Can I get a hug?

20:46.589 --> 20:49.749
I wanna give my big brother
a hug. Come on, hey.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.582
I want in.

20:51.961 --> 20:53.632
Come on! Come on, man-

20:53.632 --> 20:54.953
- [Harold] You're not coming in here, man.

20:54.953 --> 20:57.813
- Come on, Harold, let me in.
- Hey, come on, guys.

20:57.813 --> 20:58.976
- No!
- Guys.

20:58.976 --> 21:01.745
- Harold, let me in the car.
- No, you're not coming in!

21:01.745 --> 21:04.905
- That's pretty loud, guys.
It's public disturbance.

21:04.905 --> 21:06.626
- Let me in, now.

21:06.626 --> 21:08.533
- No.
- Yes, open the door!

21:08.533 --> 21:09.994
- I'm not opening the fucking door.

21:09.994 --> 21:11.288
You are not getting in here.

21:11.288 --> 21:13.456
- [Billy] Hey. (knocks) Come on, man!

21:13.456 --> 21:15.836
- Stop it!
- Open the door, right now!

21:15.836 --> 21:17.035
- [Rico] We were just having fun!

21:17.035 --> 21:19.664
- This is between me
and my brother. Shut up.

21:19.664 --> 21:21.766
Come on, dude. Open the window.

21:21.766 --> 21:23.066
Open this door, or I will break it.

21:23.066 --> 21:26.668
- Oh, come on, man.
- Hey. (knocks)

21:26.668 --> 21:28.639
- I'm on probation,
guys. Have a good night.

21:28.639 --> 21:30.224
- Good, go.
- Dude, just fucking-

21:30.224 --> 21:32.547
- Yeah, that's what
I'm doing. I'm leaving.

21:32.547 --> 21:33.380
- Harold.

21:35.677 --> 21:38.704
- You can't come in here, Billy.

21:38.704 --> 21:42.974
- So what's it gonna be,
smashed window or me inside?

21:42.974 --> 21:44.332
One.

21:44.332 --> 21:45.743
Two.

21:45.743 --> 21:47.743
Three. Come on, open up.

21:49.669 --> 21:50.648
See?

21:50.648 --> 21:52.875
Now that wasn't so hard.

21:52.875 --> 21:55.156
(grunts) I want a hug from my brother!

21:55.156 --> 21:56.996
It's just garbage, Harold.
- Stop it, Billy!

21:56.996 --> 21:59.189
Fuck, dude!
- It's just garbage!

21:59.189 --> 22:01.106
- Is this garbage? Huh?

22:01.997 --> 22:04.497
(Billy sighs)

22:06.316 --> 22:07.816
- [Billy] Oh, wow.

22:08.727 --> 22:10.810
This is, uh, so long ago.

22:11.717 --> 22:15.589
- It's 20 years, five months and 18 days.

22:15.589 --> 22:16.422
- Yeah.

22:18.148 --> 22:19.770
Yeah, that was fucked up.

22:19.770 --> 22:22.858
- [Harold] You weren't here.

22:22.858 --> 22:23.941
- I miss her.

22:24.900 --> 22:25.733
I grieved.

22:28.351 --> 22:29.857
- He killed her.

22:29.857 --> 22:33.459
I was sitting right here
and I couldn't do anything.

22:33.459 --> 22:34.940
I couldn't save her.
- What could you do?

22:34.940 --> 22:37.273
You were a fucking kid, man.

22:42.309 --> 22:44.788
- You fuckin' asshole.

22:44.788 --> 22:46.131
- [Billy] He is still our dad.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.001
- That piece of shit will never be my dad.

22:48.001 --> 22:49.937
- She was having an affair, Harold!

22:49.937 --> 22:51.730
It was tearing the family apart!

22:51.730 --> 22:53.098
- Fuck you, dude!
- Oh, come on!

22:53.098 --> 22:57.680
I come down here every weekend
after work to come see you!

22:57.680 --> 23:00.499
I'm trying to figure out a way
to help you! What can we do?

23:00.499 --> 23:01.831
- Don't you think if
I had somewhere to go,

23:01.831 --> 23:03.961
that I'd already fuckin' be-
- Fuck this, man!

23:03.961 --> 23:05.879
I mean, stop feeling sorry for yourself!

23:05.879 --> 23:07.559
There's nothing wrong with you!

23:07.559 --> 23:09.058
Grow up! Be a man!

23:09.058 --> 23:11.281
- Fuck you! Get the fuck out of my car!

23:11.281 --> 23:13.511
- Oh, man, you know what?
I'll tear you out of this car!

23:13.511 --> 23:15.049
Get over here!
- Fuck you, man!

23:15.049 --> 23:17.289
Get the fuck off me!
(Billy groans)

23:17.289 --> 23:18.921
Leave me the fuck alone, dude.

23:18.921 --> 23:21.208
- You want me to leave you
alone? Well, fine, you know what?

23:21.208 --> 23:22.400
When they come and get you,

23:22.400 --> 23:24.032
you will wish that I
was here to protect you!

23:24.032 --> 23:25.701
- Yeah.
- But you know what?

23:25.701 --> 23:29.129
Maybe that's where you
need to be. Fuck you!

(breathes heavily)

25:19.004 --> 25:20.926
- Sorry I was pounding
on your car earlier.

25:20.926 --> 25:23.926
- Jesus.
- Some guy paid us to do it.

25:25.346 --> 25:28.596
- Please just leave me alone, kid!

25:28.596 --> 25:32.045
- Could I borrow your lighter?
- Hell no!

25:32.045 --> 25:35.041
- [Jacob] I'll give you some smokes.

25:35.041 --> 25:37.075
- What kind?
- What?

25:37.075 --> 25:38.425
- What kind of smokes?

25:38.425 --> 25:39.592
- Um, Raimers.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.832
- [Harold] All right.

25:50.682 --> 25:53.432
(lighter flicks)

25:57.492 --> 26:00.242
(lighter flicks)

26:03.813 --> 26:06.803
(Jacob coughs)

26:06.803 --> 26:10.263
Where'd you get these?
- Swiped 'em from Randy.

26:10.263 --> 26:11.212
- Randy, huh?

26:11.212 --> 26:13.761
- Yeah, my mom's asshole boyfriend.

26:13.761 --> 26:16.294
- What was all that last night?

26:16.294 --> 26:20.542
- Oh, Mom and Randy. It was just a fight.

26:20.542 --> 26:24.383
Why don't you ever get out of your car?

26:24.383 --> 26:26.174
- It's a long story.

26:26.174 --> 26:29.183
- I've got time. Mom kicked
me out for a few hours.

26:29.183 --> 26:32.014
Some BS about "fresh air."

26:32.014 --> 26:36.544
That always happens when Randy
comes back after they fight.

26:36.544 --> 26:37.461
- I get it.

26:38.791 --> 26:41.464
So why are you smoking?
- I don't really smoke.

26:41.464 --> 26:44.639
I mean, I just took 'em
'cause Randy's an asshole.

26:44.639 --> 26:47.411
(Harold chuckles)

26:47.411 --> 26:50.412
- Well, let's just say the
world can be a horrible place,

26:50.412 --> 26:53.229
and it's a lot safer in here.

26:53.229 --> 26:55.307
No Randys, if you know what I mean.

26:55.307 --> 26:56.140
- I do.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.611
Why don't you have a job?

26:59.611 --> 27:02.983
(Harold chuckles)

27:02.983 --> 27:06.109
- Well, my old boss and I had
a little disagreement about

27:06.109 --> 27:10.071
how much work he thought I
could get done in the car.

27:10.071 --> 27:12.571
- [Jacob] Do you poop in here?

27:13.511 --> 27:15.795
- I throw it over the fence.

27:15.795 --> 27:18.686
- [Jacob] Do you need
anything? Food, drinks?

27:18.686 --> 27:20.085
Randy's got a bunch of beer.

27:20.085 --> 27:23.931
- Jacob! Get back over here,
it's time to come home!

27:23.931 --> 27:26.174
- Is that your mom?
- Yeah, take this, take this.

27:26.174 --> 27:27.411
All right, well, I gotta go.

27:27.411 --> 27:29.932
You wanna come over for dinner sometime?

27:29.932 --> 27:30.946
- [Jenny] Come on, kiddo!

27:30.946 --> 27:32.326
- I don't get out of the car too much.

27:32.326 --> 27:34.567
- [Jacob] Right. Sorry.

27:34.567 --> 27:36.116
- Hey, kid!

27:36.116 --> 27:38.186
Smokes?
- Keep 'em. I can get more.

27:38.186 --> 27:40.936
(peaceful music)

28:04.323 --> 28:06.253
(knocks)

28:06.253 --> 28:07.701
- Shit.

28:07.701 --> 28:09.852
(window squeaks)

28:09.852 --> 28:10.685
Hey.

28:12.441 --> 28:14.491
- (sobs) Harold.

28:14.491 --> 28:15.574
Are you okay?

28:16.481 --> 28:19.613
- Yeah. You know, livin' the dream.

28:19.613 --> 28:22.311
- Oh, come on. (sniffles)

28:22.311 --> 28:27.228
- No, I'm good. I'm okay.
(Bridgette sighs)

28:29.493 --> 28:32.422
I heard you moved to Kenner a while back.

28:32.422 --> 28:36.120
- It's not uptown, but, (sniffs) it'll do.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.212
(Harold chuckles)

28:38.212 --> 28:41.402
- Bonny mentioned you have
a lot next to you house.

28:41.402 --> 28:42.235
- No. No.

28:43.811 --> 28:46.206
Harold, this is no way to live.

28:46.206 --> 28:47.730
You're better than this.

28:47.730 --> 28:49.329
Is this about your mom?

28:49.329 --> 28:52.496
She wouldn't want this. She loved you.

28:56.872 --> 28:58.705
- I really missed you.

28:59.885 --> 29:01.302
- I missed you.

29:01.302 --> 29:03.302
Damn it, give me a drag.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.783
This is ridiculous.

29:16.449 --> 29:19.639
Just let me help you. I'm here for you.

29:19.639 --> 29:21.639
Just, just come with me.

29:24.440 --> 29:25.690
I'm right here.

29:34.691 --> 29:36.857
- You're pregnant?

29:36.857 --> 29:38.418
- [Bridgette] Yeah, I'm huge.

29:38.418 --> 29:39.537
- From who?

29:39.537 --> 29:40.954
- Remember Brian?

29:43.428 --> 29:45.579
- You gotta be fucking kidding me!

29:45.579 --> 29:47.976
- Please, wait!
(knocks)

29:47.976 --> 29:49.726
- What the fuck, man!

29:50.670 --> 29:51.503
Fuck off!

29:55.830 --> 29:56.997
What the fuck!

29:58.309 --> 30:02.476
(screams)
(thuds)

30:06.576 --> 30:07.576
Fucking why!

30:09.017 --> 30:09.850
Why!

30:18.026 --> 30:20.109
(grunts)

30:21.129 --> 30:23.296
(screams)

30:27.134 --> 30:30.655
(breathes deeply)

30:30.655 --> 30:32.033
(grunts)

30:32.033 --> 30:33.116
Fuckin' fuck!

30:43.057 --> 30:45.974
(pants and grunts)

30:50.967 --> 30:52.884
(sobs)

31:24.541 --> 31:27.794
(lively sports commentary)
(audience cheers)

31:27.794 --> 31:29.347
(Jenny chuckles)

31:29.347 --> 31:30.932
- [Announcer] Wow, look at that agility!

31:30.932 --> 31:32.594
- He's really nice.

31:32.594 --> 31:35.195
- (sighs) Give it a rest, Jake.

31:35.195 --> 31:37.677
It's not safe, you going over there.

31:37.677 --> 31:42.445
- Listen to your mother. Don't
talk to that guy, he's crazy.

31:42.445 --> 31:44.756
He's got all those homeless
people hanging around him.

31:44.756 --> 31:46.903
- Well, maybe he could use our help.

31:46.903 --> 31:48.533
- That's bullshit.

31:48.533 --> 31:49.847
If that old woman would quit feeding him,

31:49.847 --> 31:51.356
he'd get out of that car.

31:51.356 --> 31:53.523
- I'll handle this, Randy.

31:54.740 --> 31:58.013
He might be the nicest
guy in the world, but,

31:58.013 --> 32:00.574
there is something wrong with him.

32:00.574 --> 32:02.741
Okay? He lives in his car.

32:06.934 --> 32:08.791
- [Announcer] It's gotta
be the most important match

32:08.791 --> 32:11.694
of Cactus Jack's career
coming up this Sunday.

32:11.694 --> 32:15.361
- [Announcer] Well,
it's his comeback match.

32:16.561 --> 32:17.841
(knocks)
- Harold, open up.

32:17.841 --> 32:19.542
- Who is it?
- Oh, who do you think it is?

32:19.542 --> 32:22.042
It's me! Roll down the window.

32:25.182 --> 32:26.584
- [Harold] Hey, you're here.

32:26.584 --> 32:27.417
- Yeah.

32:28.792 --> 32:29.709
Oh, Harold.

32:31.188 --> 32:34.104
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.

32:34.104 --> 32:35.771
I really missed you.

32:37.041 --> 32:38.760
- [Harold] Yeah.

32:38.760 --> 32:39.593
- So?

32:40.643 --> 32:43.955
What's the plan? What did Bridgette say?

32:43.955 --> 32:46.503
(Harold chuckles)

32:46.503 --> 32:48.440
- That's not gonna work.

32:48.440 --> 32:49.734
- [Bonny] Why? What happened?

32:49.734 --> 32:51.651
She's always loved you.

32:52.532 --> 32:55.782
- She's pregnant, about to get married.

32:58.293 --> 32:59.841
No.

32:59.841 --> 33:03.073
That's... It's not gonna happen.

33:03.073 --> 33:03.906
- Um...

33:05.395 --> 33:09.978
What about Miss Rita's? Can
you make it to Miss Rita's?

33:10.933 --> 33:11.766
- I can't.

33:15.142 --> 33:18.059
- I love you, Harold, and I'm here.

33:22.494 --> 33:24.577
There's nothing out here.

33:25.480 --> 33:27.711
I have everything set up at Miss Rita's.

33:27.711 --> 33:30.878
I just need you to get out of the car.

33:33.213 --> 33:36.394
- You know... (chuckles)

33:36.394 --> 33:39.691
Out of everybody, I thought
you'd be the one to understand.

33:39.691 --> 33:43.757
- What the fuck is that
supposed to mean, Harold?

33:43.757 --> 33:45.801
(scoffs)

33:45.801 --> 33:46.793
Harold! No.

33:46.793 --> 33:49.763
Harold, don't you roll this
window up. Don't you do it!

33:49.763 --> 33:52.653
I came all the way down here
and I came here for you.

33:52.653 --> 33:54.153
Don't you do this.

33:55.356 --> 33:57.594
- I love you, Bonny.
- Harold, hey!

33:57.594 --> 33:59.162
Harold!

33:59.162 --> 34:01.151
Hey, Harold! Come on!

34:01.151 --> 34:03.281
(door handle rattles)

34:03.281 --> 34:05.031
Fucking unbelievable.

34:28.928 --> 34:31.594
(switch clicks)

34:51.393 --> 34:52.425
- You alone?

34:52.425 --> 34:53.257
- Yeah.

34:58.142 --> 34:58.975
- Hey.

34:58.975 --> 35:00.694
- What was the hollering out here?

35:00.694 --> 35:03.599
- Oh, nothin'. Just my sister.

35:03.599 --> 35:04.812
She's crazy.

35:04.812 --> 35:05.979
- She's crazy?

35:08.000 --> 35:10.583
Check out what I got.

35:10.583 --> 35:13.143
- (chuckles) I didn't expect this.

35:13.143 --> 35:14.933
Wow!
- (chuckles) Yeah.

35:14.933 --> 35:16.002
Now you can use the heater at night,

35:16.002 --> 35:18.718
and the light if you want it.

35:18.718 --> 35:20.439
- Pretty sure I don't
have a heater in here.

35:20.439 --> 35:21.638
(Jacob chuckles)

35:21.638 --> 35:25.271
- I'll work on it, but for now
you can use your microwave.

35:25.271 --> 35:26.793
- Thanks, man.

35:26.793 --> 35:29.881
I guess we should run it
through the back window.

35:29.881 --> 35:30.714
- Cool.

35:34.510 --> 35:35.860
(window squeaks)

35:35.860 --> 35:37.720
Okay, here you go.

35:37.720 --> 35:38.631
- [Harold] Thanks.

35:38.631 --> 35:41.714
- And then here's the microwave plug.

35:42.758 --> 35:44.158
- [Harold] And...

35:44.158 --> 35:44.991
- Power.

35:45.970 --> 35:47.350
Yes!
- Voila.

35:47.350 --> 35:49.220
- Does this thing run?

35:49.220 --> 35:50.995
- Uh, it used to.

35:50.995 --> 35:52.509
- Why don't you give it a try?

35:52.509 --> 35:56.877
- (chuckles) You know, I
don't know where the keys are.

35:56.877 --> 35:58.357
- Oh, my god. (chuckles)

35:58.357 --> 36:00.488
- They gotta be around
here somewhere, I just-

36:00.488 --> 36:02.388
- Yeah. All right, let's roll this up.

36:02.388 --> 36:03.430
- Okay.

36:03.430 --> 36:05.071
- How's that?

36:05.071 --> 36:07.238
- [Harold] That's perfect.

36:08.115 --> 36:09.823
All right.
- I'll see you later.

36:09.823 --> 36:11.573
- Later, man. Thanks.

36:16.985 --> 36:18.585
- Miss Rita?

36:18.585 --> 36:21.264
I'm just so fucking pissed right now.

36:21.264 --> 36:22.436
- What's wrong?

36:22.436 --> 36:24.117
- He won't get out of the car!

36:24.117 --> 36:27.063
He just...
(lighter flicks)

36:27.063 --> 36:29.824
Flat-out refuses to get out of the car.

36:29.824 --> 36:33.756
Doesn't even care that I
came all the way down here.

36:33.756 --> 36:36.087
- Come on into the kitchen, baby girl.

36:36.087 --> 36:38.246
- He's just being selfish.
That's all this is.

36:38.246 --> 36:39.578
He's being selfish and you know what?

36:39.578 --> 36:41.088
I don't know how to handle that.

36:41.088 --> 36:42.826
I don't know how I'm
supposed to deal with this.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.835
- I don't know if he bein' selfish.

36:44.835 --> 36:48.344
He say he can't get out of the car.

36:48.344 --> 36:50.625
You want some eggs?
- No.

36:50.625 --> 36:54.326
I want a drink. You still
keep the gin in the cabinet?

36:54.326 --> 36:55.159
- Freezer.

36:59.516 --> 37:00.764
- You, uh, you want one?

37:00.764 --> 37:02.546
(knife scrapes)

37:02.546 --> 37:03.379
- Sure.

37:19.634 --> 37:21.051
(Bonny sighs)

37:21.051 --> 37:23.885
- I'm just so fuckin' pissed at him.

37:23.885 --> 37:27.134
- [Rita] Calm down, baby girl.

37:27.134 --> 37:31.139
- It's not much but it should
cover some groceries at least.

37:31.139 --> 37:34.602
- Well, thank you. Every
little bit helps, baby girl.

37:34.602 --> 37:37.621
- You, uh, you want me to
help clean this kitchen?

37:37.621 --> 37:39.362
- [Rita] Sure.

37:39.362 --> 37:41.132
- You wanna pour us another drink?

37:41.132 --> 37:42.788
- [Rita] I'll pour you another drink.

37:42.788 --> 37:45.591
I'm still working on my first one.

37:45.591 --> 37:47.789
- You want this in the fridge?

37:47.789 --> 37:50.261
- That's not for salads.

37:50.261 --> 37:52.301
If you know what I mean.

37:52.301 --> 37:53.301
- Miss Rita!

37:55.422 --> 37:57.793
(sighs) Oh, you gross old lady.

37:57.793 --> 38:00.246
- Where are you goin'?

38:00.246 --> 38:03.731
Don't you get all prim and proper.

38:03.731 --> 38:06.633
(radios bleep)

38:06.633 --> 38:08.040
- One, two, two.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.433
(radios bleep)

38:10.433 --> 38:12.885
You already lost me, kid. (laughs)

38:12.885 --> 38:16.572
I can't hear Morse code. (laughs)

38:16.572 --> 38:18.763
You think these will work from that far?

38:18.763 --> 38:20.754
- Maybe. We could try.

38:20.754 --> 38:23.754
Yeah, let's do it.
- All right, cool.

38:24.783 --> 38:27.273
Don't forget your hot pocket.

38:27.273 --> 38:29.424
- Oh, I will leave it-
- Your molten-

38:29.424 --> 38:30.582
- I'll come back in a few minutes.

38:30.582 --> 38:32.665
- Lava pocket. All right.

38:34.563 --> 38:37.223
(car door slams)

38:37.223 --> 38:40.140
(melancholy music)

38:44.863 --> 38:47.335
Niner-niner, can you hear me?

38:47.335 --> 38:48.752
- Loud and clear.

38:51.352 --> 38:53.256
(Harold spits)

38:53.256 --> 38:54.756
- God!

38:54.756 --> 38:56.677
- [Jacob] Are you okay?

38:56.677 --> 38:59.148
- Yeah. So what's your fort like?

38:59.148 --> 39:00.086
- It's pretty sweet.

39:00.086 --> 39:03.337
I got a light, blankets, some
comics, snack and drinks.

39:03.337 --> 39:06.294
I could sleep in here, if I wanted.

39:06.294 --> 39:09.239
- How'd you get the extension
cord all the way over here?

39:09.239 --> 39:10.529
- Oh, I ran it out the window

39:10.529 --> 39:13.278
and then around the plants
and garbage and then

39:13.278 --> 39:17.901
through the neighbor's
yard and out to your car.

39:17.901 --> 39:20.360
- (chuckles) Is everybody okay with that?

39:20.360 --> 39:23.701
- Not sure. I've got it
pretty well-hidden, though.

39:23.701 --> 39:26.200
- I'm betting Randy
wouldn't appreciate it.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.687
- You're right about that.

39:28.687 --> 39:30.960
Was your dad an asshole?

39:30.960 --> 39:31.793
- Yeah.

39:33.490 --> 39:36.407
- Is that why you live in your car?

39:37.252 --> 39:38.085
- Sort of.

39:40.668 --> 39:41.918
- I understand.

39:43.109 --> 39:46.029
I heard that he, um, kill...

39:46.029 --> 39:46.946
Never mind.

39:49.421 --> 39:50.254
- Yeah.

39:51.421 --> 39:52.254
He did.

39:55.702 --> 39:57.642
(radio bleeps)

39:57.642 --> 40:01.559
- Sometimes I worry that
Randy might just snap.

40:12.102 --> 40:16.352
- [Harold] Your mom's on
the porch looking for you.

40:22.430 --> 40:24.391
(Jenny sniffles)

40:24.391 --> 40:26.868
- Oh! Thank god, sweetie.

40:26.868 --> 40:29.167
I've been looking for you.

40:29.167 --> 40:32.063
I'm going to Rosemary's.
You wanna come with me?

40:32.063 --> 40:34.230
- No, I'll just stay here.

40:35.572 --> 40:38.091
- Fine, just stay out of
Randy's path, all right?

40:38.091 --> 40:40.030
He's in a real mood.

40:40.030 --> 40:41.280
- Are you okay?

40:42.904 --> 40:45.737
- Baby... (sighs)

40:47.710 --> 40:49.129
I'm fine.

40:49.129 --> 40:50.429
(glass shatters)

40:50.429 --> 40:51.262
Oh, god!

40:52.150 --> 40:53.327
Just come with me, okay?

40:53.327 --> 40:55.348
- No, I'll be fine, Mom. Don't worry.

40:55.348 --> 40:58.109
(Jenny sighs)

40:58.109 --> 41:01.488
- You stay in your room till I get back.

41:01.488 --> 41:03.119
God, Randy.

41:03.119 --> 41:05.588
This crazy guy in his car.

41:05.588 --> 41:09.005
Jesus, help me! (grunts)

41:32.044 --> 41:34.882
(loud crashing)

41:34.882 --> 41:37.382
- Jacob! Jacob, are you there?

41:45.502 --> 41:46.835
- You happy now?

41:47.864 --> 41:50.781
(breathes heavily)

41:53.997 --> 41:56.997
(trash can rattles)

42:02.009 --> 42:04.926
(trash can clangs)

42:05.992 --> 42:07.159
What the fuck?

42:13.118 --> 42:15.398
You gotta be fucking kidding!

42:15.398 --> 42:18.312
(grunts)

42:18.312 --> 42:21.673
This is all your fault,
you fucking retard!

42:21.673 --> 42:24.506
Stay the fuck away from my family!

42:25.663 --> 42:27.163
- Leave him alone!

42:28.472 --> 42:29.916
- What the hell did you just say to me?

42:29.916 --> 42:31.042
- [Jacob] I said leave him alone!

42:31.042 --> 42:32.464
- [Randy] What the hell
did you just say to me?

42:32.464 --> 42:34.734
(tense music)

42:34.734 --> 42:35.567
Huh!

42:36.922 --> 42:39.589
- [Harold] Lock the door, Jacob!

42:43.880 --> 42:45.681
(door rattles)

42:45.681 --> 42:47.412
(heavy knocks)
- Open the fucking door!

42:47.412 --> 42:48.862
- Leave me alone!

42:48.862 --> 42:49.827
(Randy grunts)

42:49.827 --> 42:51.148
(screams)

42:51.148 --> 42:53.681
- Jesus! Look what you made me do!

42:53.681 --> 42:56.383
(Jacob screams)

42:56.383 --> 42:58.702
You're fine, it's...
Stop crying like a girl.

42:58.702 --> 43:00.285
I said stop crying!

43:02.481 --> 43:05.898
(distant machine bleeps)

43:07.601 --> 43:10.267
(Jenny sighs)

43:10.267 --> 43:13.149
- Sweetie, I'm... (sniffles)

43:13.149 --> 43:14.232
I'm so sorry.

43:16.651 --> 43:17.484
So sorry.

43:19.972 --> 43:24.201
I know I've said this a
million times, but... (sighs)

43:24.201 --> 43:25.951
This stops now, okay?

43:28.311 --> 43:30.949
We're in this together. We're a team.

43:30.949 --> 43:32.282
No more of this.

43:33.347 --> 43:35.091
- I love you.

43:35.091 --> 43:36.522
- I love you too.

43:36.522 --> 43:37.355
So much.

43:38.501 --> 43:41.022
(sighs)

43:41.022 --> 43:43.949
- Is he gonna be there when we get home?

43:43.949 --> 43:46.591
- [Gautreaux] All right,
Jacob, how does that feel?

43:46.591 --> 43:47.591
- It's okay.

43:48.971 --> 43:52.480
- Oh, it's okay. No need for
tears, he's gonna be fine.

43:52.480 --> 43:53.313
I promise.

43:54.151 --> 43:56.460
Keep it dry. Bag it during bath time.

43:56.460 --> 43:59.348
It's gonna get itchy. Don't
jam anything down there.

43:59.348 --> 44:00.265
Super easy.

44:01.190 --> 44:02.511
- All right.

44:02.511 --> 44:05.251
- You'll be back on your
bike before you know it.

44:05.251 --> 44:07.061
(Jenny chuckles)

44:07.061 --> 44:09.851
Betty will take care
of you on your way out.

44:09.851 --> 44:12.018
I'll see you in six weeks.

44:13.142 --> 44:15.392
- Thank you, Dr. Gautreaux.

44:16.321 --> 44:21.321
(phones ring)
(background chatter)

44:24.542 --> 44:26.570
- I mean, we have to figure something out.

44:26.570 --> 44:29.232
Otherwise, they just cart
him off to the psych ward

44:29.232 --> 44:32.650
whenever they come and tow the car.

44:32.650 --> 44:35.702
- Maybe that's where he belongs.

44:35.702 --> 44:38.009
- Hush your mouth, boy!

44:38.009 --> 44:42.121
Don't you dare say that! That's your kin!

44:42.121 --> 44:44.871
Y'all are the only family he got.

44:46.002 --> 44:47.419
- He is not well.

44:48.261 --> 44:50.284
- Do we know who called the cops?

44:50.284 --> 44:53.265
- Oh, five bucks it's Randy.

44:53.265 --> 44:55.581
- That guy has always been an asshole.

44:55.581 --> 44:56.414
- Mm-hm.

44:58.689 --> 45:02.198
I know what we should do about Randy.

45:02.198 --> 45:03.899
- Not in front of the baby, Miss Rita.

45:03.899 --> 45:06.807
Come on.
- You shouldn't even play.

45:06.807 --> 45:07.640
- Relax.

45:10.352 --> 45:12.521
- I mean, obviously he's suffering

45:12.521 --> 45:15.438
from some sort of mental breakdown.

45:16.289 --> 45:19.152
Look, I don't like it any
more than you guys, but,

45:19.152 --> 45:22.314
I think we should have him committed.

45:22.314 --> 45:26.343
I think it'd be best if it came
from us instead of the cops.

45:26.343 --> 45:27.712
- Really?

45:27.712 --> 45:28.932
That's harsh.

45:28.932 --> 45:30.241
- Harsh?

45:30.241 --> 45:33.521
Okay, well, I don't hear you
suggesting anything, Rico.

45:33.521 --> 45:36.688
- Okay, Billy. We can figure this out.

45:38.583 --> 45:41.508
- Well, what about taking the
car over to Bridgette's house?

45:41.508 --> 45:45.281
- Look, I'd offer, but once he
saw my belly, he freaked out.

45:45.281 --> 45:48.891
- Yeah, I told you guys
that that wasn't gonna work.

45:48.891 --> 45:51.291
- Right, well, where are all
of your big bright ideas?

45:51.291 --> 45:53.431
- Well, I tried literally
pulling him out of the car.

45:53.431 --> 45:55.892
- Yeah, how'd that go?
- Hey, I have been here!

45:55.892 --> 45:58.560
I see him every weekend after work.

45:58.560 --> 46:00.537
Where have you been, Bonny?
- Y'all calm down.

46:00.537 --> 46:03.111
- No, no. We have tried everything.

46:03.111 --> 46:05.278
I mean, we've played nice.

46:06.452 --> 46:09.369
Well, now it's time for tough love.

46:10.701 --> 46:15.371
- I don't think Harold
need no tough love, Billy.

46:15.371 --> 46:16.531
He got enough of that,

46:16.531 --> 46:19.864
growing up in the house with your daddy.

46:22.720 --> 46:25.859
- If we commit him, then
we can take control of it.

46:25.859 --> 46:26.720
If the cops do it,

46:26.720 --> 46:29.341
then we don't know if we're
gonna be able to see him.

46:29.341 --> 46:31.651
We don't know when, if ever!

46:31.651 --> 46:34.937
And you don't even know
what this is about, Bonny.

46:34.937 --> 46:36.971
- Well, then why don't
you enlighten me, Billy?

46:36.971 --> 46:39.059
Or get the fuck out.

46:39.059 --> 46:39.892
- Gladly.

46:41.282 --> 46:43.270
- Come on, Billy, don't leave.
- Billy!

46:43.270 --> 46:46.937
- Billy, stay.
- Billy, you don't have to go!

46:50.212 --> 46:51.712
- Fucking typical.

47:00.142 --> 47:01.968
- Motherfucker.

47:01.968 --> 47:04.885
(breathes heavily)

47:13.853 --> 47:16.353
(jacket zips)

47:27.162 --> 47:28.912
(knocks)

47:28.912 --> 47:29.912
- Who is it?

47:31.194 --> 47:35.092
- [Billy] It's me, Harold. It's Billy.

47:35.092 --> 47:36.874
You mind rolling down the window?

47:36.874 --> 47:38.041
- No way, man.

47:41.514 --> 47:42.514
- Look, man.

47:43.974 --> 47:47.242
I'm sorry about the other night.

47:47.242 --> 47:48.742
That was wrong of me.

47:48.742 --> 47:51.863
I shouldn't have tried
pulling you out, but um,

47:51.863 --> 47:54.132
the truth is, man, I'm scared,

47:54.132 --> 47:57.632
because you're not giving us many options.

47:59.223 --> 48:02.663
You won't come out on your own,
you won't go to Bridgette's,

48:02.663 --> 48:05.512
you won't go to Miss
Rita's and you've denied

48:05.512 --> 48:08.555
every opportunity to
come over to my place,

48:08.555 --> 48:10.401
and you've just proven that
you can't be pulled out,

48:10.401 --> 48:13.242
but the truth is, Harold,
you have to get out,

48:13.242 --> 48:16.812
because when the cops come,
they're gonna take you.

48:16.812 --> 48:21.123
And when that happens,
we may not see you again.

48:21.123 --> 48:24.290
And if that happens, then I don't know

48:26.022 --> 48:27.314
if I can live with that.

48:27.314 --> 48:29.897
(somber music)

48:32.403 --> 48:34.736
I just want my brother back.

48:37.083 --> 48:37.916
Harold?

49:05.257 --> 49:07.757
(fridge hums)

49:20.859 --> 49:23.526
(metal rattles)

49:27.091 --> 49:28.438
(knocks)

49:28.438 --> 49:29.855
- Harold, you up?

49:33.068 --> 49:34.310
- [Harold] Jacob?

49:34.310 --> 49:35.668
- Yeah.

49:35.668 --> 49:37.346
- Are you all right, man?

49:37.346 --> 49:39.739
I saw Randy and then
you and Jenny took off

49:39.739 --> 49:43.249
and he disappeared and I
didn't see y'all get home.

49:43.249 --> 49:44.666
- Yeah, I'm okay.

49:45.542 --> 49:47.490
He broke my wrist.

49:47.490 --> 49:49.667
- [Harold] Oh, my god.
Are you sure you're okay?

49:49.667 --> 49:50.739
What's Jenny gonna do?

49:50.739 --> 49:53.710
- I'm fine and I think
Randy's gone for good now.

49:53.710 --> 49:54.543
- Really?

49:55.469 --> 49:58.501
- Yeah, anyways, since he
found the extension cord,

49:58.501 --> 50:00.069
I thought you might be hungry.

50:00.069 --> 50:01.689
Want hotdogs?
(Harold laughs)

50:01.689 --> 50:06.059
- You're crazy, kid. Are
you sure this is okay?

50:06.059 --> 50:08.878
- Yeah, Mom said it was fine.

50:08.878 --> 50:12.158
- Well hell, let's do it.
Pull it a little closer, man.

50:12.158 --> 50:13.325
- Here you go.

50:15.738 --> 50:18.369
(Harold laughs)

50:18.369 --> 50:19.202
All right.

50:23.906 --> 50:25.989
Let's fill this.
- Yeah, pour those in here.

50:25.989 --> 50:27.188
- All right.

50:27.188 --> 50:29.191
- [Harold] Wow, how old is this thing?

50:29.191 --> 50:33.628
- [Jacob] I have no idea.
Randy bought it used.

50:33.628 --> 50:35.721
- [Harold] Man, this grill
is holier than church.

50:35.721 --> 50:36.554
- Yeah.

50:41.187 --> 50:43.380
Can you hold this?
- Yeah, here.

50:43.380 --> 50:46.770
Mom said for you to do that.
- All right.

50:46.770 --> 50:49.670
Holy crap. This grill's in
worse shape than my car.

50:49.670 --> 50:52.587
- (chuckles) Yeah.

50:54.105 --> 50:55.105
- All right.

50:56.250 --> 50:58.290
- Yeah, there we go.
(Harold chuckles)

50:58.290 --> 51:01.329
(chuckles)

51:01.329 --> 51:04.996
(Harold mumbles to himself)

51:06.460 --> 51:08.707
(chuckles)

51:08.707 --> 51:09.707
There we go.

51:11.021 --> 51:12.021
Boom.
- Yeah.

51:14.135 --> 51:14.968
- Yeah.

51:18.016 --> 51:18.959
- Voila.

51:18.959 --> 51:21.959
- Voila. (chuckles)

51:23.765 --> 51:24.886
- Voila.

51:24.886 --> 51:27.365
I mean, I just want one,
man. I'll be good with one.

51:27.365 --> 51:29.097
- Yeah.
- Start with one?

51:29.097 --> 51:29.930
All right.

51:33.326 --> 51:34.925
Thanks for doing this. This is awesome.

51:34.925 --> 51:37.256
- Yeah, I thought it'd be fun.

51:37.256 --> 51:38.959
You know, if I put some gas in your car,

51:38.959 --> 51:40.959
then you can just leave and you can go

51:40.959 --> 51:42.677
anywhere you want and
still be in your car.

51:42.677 --> 51:47.344
- Here, pass me those buns.
I'll toast 'em on the grill.

51:48.886 --> 51:52.018
I wouldn't wanna leave
you here all alone, man.

51:52.018 --> 51:53.629
Besides, have you seen these windows?

51:53.629 --> 51:55.818
I'm gonna get in a wreck
if I drive five feet.

51:55.818 --> 51:59.440
- [Jacob] (chuckles) Yeah.

51:59.440 --> 52:01.439
- [Harold] Do you have any accoutrements?

52:01.439 --> 52:04.109
- These are hotdogs. Why would
you pout croutons on them?

52:04.109 --> 52:06.085
- (chuckles) Mustard.

52:06.085 --> 52:06.918
- Oh.

52:08.349 --> 52:10.349
I actually like ketchup.

52:13.127 --> 52:14.526
- Okay.

52:14.526 --> 52:15.943
We'll do ketchup.

52:16.886 --> 52:18.724
Just hang onto it until we're done.

52:18.724 --> 52:20.807
- [Jacob] All right.

52:20.807 --> 52:23.640
Oh, yeah. It's gonna hit the spot.

52:28.507 --> 52:29.340
Nice.

52:30.416 --> 52:33.098
You know, we should clean these windows.

52:33.098 --> 52:35.183
I mean, maybe I could go with you.

52:35.183 --> 52:36.326
(Harold chuckles)

52:36.326 --> 52:39.516
- I don't think your
mom would go for that.

52:39.516 --> 52:41.905
I'm flattered, but...

52:41.905 --> 52:45.606
You don't wanna leave her here all alone.

52:45.606 --> 52:48.174
- I mean, I've been telling
her how nice you are.

52:48.174 --> 52:50.255
- Hey, has anyone signed your cast yet?

52:50.255 --> 52:51.318
- [Jacob] No.

52:51.318 --> 52:53.717
- It's the best part of having a cast!

52:53.717 --> 52:55.134
Here, let me see.

52:58.443 --> 52:59.276
(knocks)

52:59.276 --> 53:01.433
That hurt?
- Mm, a little bit.

53:01.433 --> 53:04.433
- All right, I'll be quick. Hang on.

53:06.559 --> 53:07.809
I got a marker.

53:15.686 --> 53:16.686
Almost done.

53:20.967 --> 53:23.721
My last name's pretty long.

53:23.721 --> 53:26.339
All right. There you go.

53:26.339 --> 53:28.589
- Really, dude? What the hell?
- What?

53:28.589 --> 53:29.962
What? You're reading it upside down.

53:29.962 --> 53:32.462
It says "your friend, Harold."

53:38.048 --> 53:39.978
- It says "chronic masturbator."

53:39.978 --> 53:41.459
(Harold chuckles)

53:41.459 --> 53:44.921
- Sorry, I couldn't help
it, dude. (chuckles)

53:44.921 --> 53:46.991
Come on, it makes you look edgy.

53:46.991 --> 53:48.047
- [Jacob] No, it does not.

53:48.047 --> 53:50.990
It makes me look like some
guy in his car signed my cast.

53:50.990 --> 53:53.579
(Harold laughs)

53:53.579 --> 53:54.919
Whatever.
- That's offensive.

53:54.919 --> 53:57.002
- [Jacob] Let's just eat.

54:01.779 --> 54:04.229
- I bet we're gonna get some
extra vitamins from this grill.

54:04.229 --> 54:05.146
- Oh, yeah.

54:07.928 --> 54:09.209
Which one do you want?

54:09.209 --> 54:11.131
- I don't know. Whichever
one's not poisoned.

54:11.131 --> 54:12.901
(Jacob chuckles)

54:12.901 --> 54:15.561
I'll take that one.
- Cool.

54:15.561 --> 54:18.394
Would you like some, uh, croutons?

54:19.484 --> 54:21.396
- Sure.
- Here, you can do it.

54:21.396 --> 54:24.255
- I'd prefer mustard, but uh...

54:24.255 --> 54:25.088
Anyways.

54:26.934 --> 54:29.034
This has a seal.

54:29.034 --> 54:32.951
- Oh, sorry. I just
grabbed it from the fridge.

54:36.355 --> 54:38.105
- Fresh accoutrement!

54:39.195 --> 54:41.116
- Yep, love them croutons.

54:41.116 --> 54:44.335
- I think I'm pronouncing it right.

54:44.335 --> 54:45.168
Yeah.

54:45.168 --> 54:48.721
Oh, I think I got too much. Here you go.

54:48.721 --> 54:50.294
Whatever.

54:50.294 --> 54:52.961
All right, let's see how we did.

54:57.454 --> 54:58.537
- [Jacob] Mm!

55:00.004 --> 55:02.185
- Could use mustard, but it's all right.

55:02.185 --> 55:03.018
- Yeah.

55:04.344 --> 55:06.523
- Not bad for from the car.

55:06.523 --> 55:07.773
- Yeah, really.

55:10.564 --> 55:12.425
- Thanks, Jacob.
- Yeah, no problem.

55:12.425 --> 55:14.491
Maybe we could-
- Go ahead and get mine.

55:14.491 --> 55:17.043
- Give a little bit to the cat.

55:17.043 --> 55:17.876
Yeah.

55:21.185 --> 55:22.352
Mm, real good.

55:26.182 --> 55:28.682
- It hit the spot, man.
- Yeah.

55:30.798 --> 55:33.131
- So you like the signature?

55:34.649 --> 55:37.032
- "So you like the signature?"
- It's awesome!

55:37.032 --> 55:39.921
- Oh, my gosh! I'm gonna
get bullied for this, dude.

55:39.921 --> 55:42.979
- Screw that. Just tell 'em
it's your favorite band.

55:42.979 --> 55:45.470
They'll think you're like edgy.

55:45.470 --> 55:48.151
- Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

55:48.151 --> 55:50.270
- Next time we should
make more for the cat.

55:50.270 --> 55:51.791
- Yeah, for sure.
- Lookin' scrawny.

55:51.791 --> 55:53.638
- [Jacob] Yeah, he ate like half of mine.

55:53.638 --> 55:56.388
- Yeah. (laughs)

55:57.259 --> 55:58.092
Ah, shit.

56:00.269 --> 56:02.130
Dude, you better go.

56:02.130 --> 56:03.130
Sorry, dude.

56:04.588 --> 56:07.255
Just leave that. Get outta here.

56:17.995 --> 56:19.606
- Harold?

56:19.606 --> 56:20.439
Harold.

56:21.635 --> 56:24.073
Harold, don't close the window. Harold?

56:24.073 --> 56:26.451
- [Harold] Give me one good reason.

56:26.451 --> 56:29.034
- Rico told me what's going on.

56:31.434 --> 56:33.983
How was I supposed to know this
had anything to do with Mom?

56:33.983 --> 56:36.650
I mean, you didn't say anything.

56:37.551 --> 56:40.400
- I shouldn't have to, Bonny.

56:40.400 --> 56:43.343
It happened right fucking here.

56:43.343 --> 56:47.613
- But it didn't happen
yesterday, Harold. It...

56:47.613 --> 56:48.446
I know.

56:50.151 --> 56:50.984
I know.

56:52.313 --> 56:53.230
I love you.

57:00.162 --> 57:02.510
You wanna talk about it?

57:02.510 --> 57:03.932
- Not really.

57:03.932 --> 57:06.722
- [Bonny] Can I do anything?

57:06.722 --> 57:07.555
- I wish.

57:08.852 --> 57:10.263
(mumbles)

57:10.263 --> 57:12.440
- You're my favorite brother,
Harold, and I can't lose you,

57:12.440 --> 57:14.402
so I'm gonna need you
to get out of this car.

57:14.402 --> 57:16.451
- You know it's not that easy.

57:16.451 --> 57:18.368
I want to get out, I...

57:19.440 --> 57:23.107
I can't fucking just
get out, you know that.

57:24.410 --> 57:25.559
I can't.

57:25.559 --> 57:26.851
- Okay.

57:26.851 --> 57:27.684
It's okay.

57:29.452 --> 57:30.285
All right.

57:31.152 --> 57:33.170
Comin' in!
- Hey whoa, what're you doing?

57:33.170 --> 57:34.141
- I'm comin' in.

57:34.141 --> 57:35.381
- No.
- Yes!

57:35.381 --> 57:37.900
- No, you can't fucking come in here!

57:37.900 --> 57:39.033
- Scoot over.

57:39.033 --> 57:41.276
- [Harold] I am not
letting you in this car.

57:41.276 --> 57:42.595
- Mm-hm. We'll see.

57:42.595 --> 57:44.646
- What're you doing?
- Move over!

57:44.646 --> 57:46.866
Stay still and stop squirming!

57:46.866 --> 57:48.523
- Jesus, Bonny!
- Okay, stop it!

57:48.523 --> 57:51.266
(horn blares)
- Fucking Christ!

57:51.266 --> 57:53.570
You're fucking crazy!

57:53.570 --> 57:55.428
Fucking can't believe you, Bonny.

57:55.428 --> 57:58.266
What the fuck?
(Bonny giggles)

57:58.266 --> 58:00.429
- I didn't spill a drop. (chuckles)

58:00.429 --> 58:03.762
- Congratulations.
- You should catch up.

58:08.019 --> 58:10.358
- [Harold] Fucking space woman.

58:10.358 --> 58:14.108
- You know, it's not half-bad
in here. Pretty spacious.

58:14.108 --> 58:14.941
- Thanks.

58:17.266 --> 58:18.746
- You think I could crash here tonight?

58:18.746 --> 58:20.050
(Harold spits)

58:20.050 --> 58:20.883
- What?

58:21.838 --> 58:25.177
Are you out of your fucking mind, girl?

58:25.177 --> 58:28.677
- [Bonny] Nope. (giggles)

58:32.498 --> 58:34.664
- You have no sense of smell.

58:34.664 --> 58:36.914
- Are you gonna tuck me in?

58:39.090 --> 58:39.923
Boop.

58:42.467 --> 58:43.457
(chuckles)

58:43.457 --> 58:45.540
- You're such an asshole.

58:46.877 --> 58:50.691
- Love you.
- (sighs) I love you too.

58:50.691 --> 58:53.280
(Bonny sighs)

58:53.280 --> 58:56.197
(gasoline swashes)

59:01.562 --> 59:04.513
(cover creaks)

59:04.513 --> 59:06.263
- [Jacob] What the...

59:09.531 --> 59:12.448
(gasoline swashes)

59:16.404 --> 59:19.006
(gasoline trickles)

59:19.006 --> 59:20.006
Hey, Harold.

59:20.917 --> 59:22.215
I put some gas in your car.

59:22.215 --> 59:26.798
Now you can turn it on and
use the heater, if you want.

59:28.018 --> 59:30.935
(gasoline swashes)

59:37.094 --> 59:38.094
- What's up?

59:38.943 --> 59:41.733
- Hey, you lightin' that
weirdo's car on fire?

59:41.733 --> 59:42.873
- [Jacob] No.

59:42.873 --> 59:44.165
- [Josh] Do you wanna
fuck with him some more?

59:44.165 --> 59:45.694
- Just leave him alone, all right?

59:45.694 --> 59:48.394
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

59:48.394 --> 59:49.903
- Come on, let's get the fuck outta here.

59:49.903 --> 59:51.486
- Yeah, just leave.

1:00:17.093 --> 1:00:18.584
(Bonny yawns)

1:00:18.584 --> 1:00:21.394
- [Bonny] He seems nice.

1:00:21.394 --> 1:00:23.446
- Yeah. He's a good kid.

1:00:23.446 --> 1:00:26.064
(window squeaks)

1:00:26.064 --> 1:00:29.155
- (sighs) God.

1:00:29.155 --> 1:00:30.072
I gotta go.

1:00:32.315 --> 1:00:34.917
Billy wants to put you in the nut house.

1:00:34.917 --> 1:00:35.750
- What?

1:00:36.986 --> 1:00:38.278
Motherfucker.

1:00:38.278 --> 1:00:42.477
- Don't worry. I'm not gonna
let him boss me around.

1:00:42.477 --> 1:00:46.317
But I am gonna need you to
get out of this car, Harold.

1:00:46.317 --> 1:00:47.150
And soon.

1:00:50.866 --> 1:00:52.594
- You want that?
- Mm, yeah.

1:00:52.594 --> 1:00:53.511
Absolutely.

1:00:58.804 --> 1:01:02.304
(Harold breathes shakily)

1:01:07.557 --> 1:01:09.921
(knocks)

1:01:09.921 --> 1:01:12.220
- [Harold] Go away, Bonny. You're drunk.

1:01:12.220 --> 1:01:14.725
- [Jacob] It's Jacob.

1:01:14.725 --> 1:01:17.798
- It's too cold to play
games, kid. Get back inside.

1:01:17.798 --> 1:01:19.215
- [Jenny] Harold?

1:01:24.927 --> 1:01:26.303
- [Harold] Oh.

1:01:26.303 --> 1:01:29.310
- Hi, Harold. (chuckles) It's
nice to finally meet you.

1:01:29.310 --> 1:01:31.925
Jake just wanted to bring
you an extra blanket.

1:01:31.925 --> 1:01:33.508
- It's really warm.

1:01:34.801 --> 1:01:36.299
- [Harold] Thanks.

1:01:36.299 --> 1:01:37.550
- You know, if you give
us some of your laundry,

1:01:37.550 --> 1:01:39.497
we could do a load for you.

1:01:39.497 --> 1:01:41.965
- Oh, no. That's too much to ask.

1:01:41.965 --> 1:01:43.848
- [Jenny] We insist.

1:01:43.848 --> 1:01:46.579
- No, no. Really, I can't do it.

1:01:46.579 --> 1:01:48.496
- Hand it over, mister.

1:01:50.698 --> 1:01:53.531
(plastic rustles)

1:01:56.554 --> 1:01:59.387
(plastic rustles)

1:02:05.225 --> 1:02:08.043
- All right, I'll get
these back to you tomorrow.

1:02:08.043 --> 1:02:09.954
- Thanks, man.
- Okay.

1:02:09.954 --> 1:02:10.787
Stay warm.

1:02:11.906 --> 1:02:13.573
- Goodnight, Harold.

1:02:15.884 --> 1:02:17.717
That was really kind of you.

1:02:17.717 --> 1:02:19.627
- I told you he was nice.

1:02:19.627 --> 1:02:20.960
- Yeah, you did.

1:02:24.608 --> 1:02:27.902
(Harold moans)

1:02:27.902 --> 1:02:30.485
(Harold sighs)

1:02:39.135 --> 1:02:41.885
(strums ukulele)

1:02:43.648 --> 1:02:47.231
(melancholy ukulele music)

1:03:04.793 --> 1:03:06.949
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you crazy?

1:03:06.949 --> 1:03:08.691
- What? I have an itch!
- Get that out of there!

1:03:08.691 --> 1:03:09.651
- What?

1:03:09.651 --> 1:03:12.879
- Don't, don't jam that in your cast, man.

1:03:12.879 --> 1:03:16.211
Don't jam stuff in your
cast. Seriously, get it out.

1:03:16.211 --> 1:03:18.582
Seriously, get it out. That's, you could-

1:03:18.582 --> 1:03:19.582
- All right.

1:03:20.588 --> 1:03:22.663
Oh, that smells awful.
(Harold chuckles)

1:03:22.663 --> 1:03:24.312
Here.
- No, I'm not smelling that.

1:03:24.312 --> 1:03:25.952
- No, take it, for real.
- No, I'm not smelling-

1:03:25.952 --> 1:03:28.369
- No, it's not that bad.
- No.

1:03:30.404 --> 1:03:32.487
(coughs)

1:03:50.265 --> 1:03:51.574
Hello.

1:03:51.574 --> 1:03:54.741
- Goodbye. (chuckles)

1:03:59.737 --> 1:04:00.863
- Hey, boys.
- Hello.

1:04:00.863 --> 1:04:02.840
- Got more goodies for you.

1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:04.213
- Whoa.

1:04:04.213 --> 1:04:05.194
Nice.

1:04:05.194 --> 1:04:06.082
Thanks.

1:04:06.082 --> 1:04:08.665
- [Jacob] Gonna eat some lunch.

1:04:52.291 --> 1:04:54.874
(Harold sighs)

1:05:13.410 --> 1:05:15.493
(knocks)

1:05:16.852 --> 1:05:18.778
- Hey, Mom did some more laundry for you.

1:05:18.778 --> 1:05:21.882
- Oh, wow. Tell her I
said thank you so much.

1:05:21.882 --> 1:05:23.641
- No problem. Mind if I hop in?

1:05:23.641 --> 1:05:25.891
- Oh, sure. Come on around.

1:05:30.320 --> 1:05:32.871
(car door opens)

1:05:32.871 --> 1:05:34.499
(car door closes)

1:05:34.499 --> 1:05:36.810
(Jacob mimics engine revving)

1:05:36.810 --> 1:05:38.036
(both chuckle)

1:05:38.036 --> 1:05:39.889
- Man, this old thing's
really got some juice.

1:05:39.889 --> 1:05:42.339
(Harold chuckles)
So where are we headed?

1:05:42.339 --> 1:05:45.401
- Huh. I've always wanted to see Florida.

1:05:45.401 --> 1:05:48.041
- All right, buckle up.
I drive really fast.

1:05:48.041 --> 1:05:48.874
- Okay.

1:05:50.062 --> 1:05:51.610
(seat belts click)

1:05:51.610 --> 1:05:53.331
Take it easy till we get
out of town, all right?

1:05:53.331 --> 1:05:57.141
- (chuckles) No problem.
How do I look on that side?

1:05:57.141 --> 1:05:58.141
- All clear.

1:06:01.423 --> 1:06:03.330
- All right.
- All right.

1:06:03.330 --> 1:06:06.003
(Jacob mimics engine revving)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:06:06.003 --> 1:06:07.511
Slow down, man!

1:06:07.511 --> 1:06:08.984
Left! Left!

1:06:08.984 --> 1:06:11.401
(Jacob screeches)
(screams)

1:06:11.401 --> 1:06:12.742
(Jacob mimics engine revving)

1:06:12.742 --> 1:06:14.583
Oh, my god! Look out for those elephants!

1:06:14.583 --> 1:06:17.352
- To hell with the elephants!
We need to get to the beach!

1:06:17.352 --> 1:06:18.983
(mimics engine revving)

1:06:18.983 --> 1:06:21.575
- Oh, you're passing up
our turn! Go back, go back!

1:06:21.575 --> 1:06:22.995
(Jacob screeches)

1:06:22.995 --> 1:06:24.323
(both laugh)

1:06:24.323 --> 1:06:25.615
- Oh, my god!

1:06:25.615 --> 1:06:27.532
That was the elephants.

1:06:28.662 --> 1:06:29.832
Boom!

1:06:29.832 --> 1:06:32.249
(both laugh)

1:06:33.184 --> 1:06:35.698
- Yeah, that's a mess.

1:06:35.698 --> 1:06:38.096
- So where are you two boys headed today?

1:06:38.096 --> 1:06:40.275
- We're going to Florida, to the beach.

1:06:40.275 --> 1:06:42.002
- The beach? Very nice.

1:06:42.002 --> 1:06:44.275
Well, when are you gonna be back?

1:06:44.275 --> 1:06:46.013
'Cause I need to go to the store.

1:06:46.013 --> 1:06:48.115
- Uh, I'm fine here.

1:06:48.115 --> 1:06:49.865
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

1:06:50.983 --> 1:06:52.587
- Yeah, that's what I
thought you were gonna say.

1:06:52.587 --> 1:06:55.577
Well, I made you boys up some lunch.

1:06:55.577 --> 1:06:57.586
- Oh, my favorite.
- Thanks.

1:06:57.586 --> 1:06:59.353
- And you're sure about this, Harold?

1:06:59.353 --> 1:07:01.861
- [Harold] Of course.

1:07:01.861 --> 1:07:02.816
- Okay.

1:07:02.816 --> 1:07:05.553
- By the way, thank you for
doing my laundry for me.

1:07:05.553 --> 1:07:07.544
You would not believe
how sudsy it gets in here

1:07:07.544 --> 1:07:08.784
when I try to do it.

1:07:08.784 --> 1:07:10.464
- (chuckles) Yeah, right.

1:07:10.464 --> 1:07:11.706
- You boys have fun.

1:07:11.706 --> 1:07:13.024
- All right. Love you, Mom.

1:07:13.024 --> 1:07:15.534
Could I get a sandwich too, Harold?

1:07:15.534 --> 1:07:17.784
(chuckles)

1:07:19.822 --> 1:07:24.181
Hey, we did a really good
job cleaning this place up.

1:07:24.181 --> 1:07:26.103
I mean, we got all your clothes folded,

1:07:26.103 --> 1:07:27.963
got that dumb microwave outta here.

1:07:27.963 --> 1:07:29.255
(Harold chuckles)

1:07:29.255 --> 1:07:30.653
- Yeah, I really appreciate it, man.

1:07:30.653 --> 1:07:31.570
- Yeah. Oh.

1:07:33.453 --> 1:07:35.425
- Oh, yeah.
- You found the key!

1:07:35.425 --> 1:07:37.895
- It was under the seat the whole time.

1:07:37.895 --> 1:07:39.912
(laughs)

1:07:39.912 --> 1:07:43.094
- Gosh.
- I'm not gonna use it.

1:07:43.094 --> 1:07:45.381
- Mind if I?
- No, go ahead, try it.

1:07:45.381 --> 1:07:48.214
(ignition clicks)

1:07:52.405 --> 1:07:53.488
- [Jacob] Hm.

1:07:54.334 --> 1:07:56.143
I wonder what it is.

1:07:56.143 --> 1:07:57.911
- I got no idea.
(muffled music)

1:07:57.911 --> 1:07:58.994
- [Jacob] Oh.

1:08:01.655 --> 1:08:03.452
(lively rap music)

1:08:03.452 --> 1:08:05.968
- You gonna mess with that girl, right?

1:08:05.968 --> 1:08:08.528
- Shit, man, where's mine?

1:08:08.528 --> 1:08:10.111
- Someone's coming.

1:08:14.476 --> 1:08:15.476
- Hey, wait!

1:08:16.587 --> 1:08:17.809
Jacob, what're you doing?

1:08:17.809 --> 1:08:19.830
(tires screech)
- Shit!

1:08:19.830 --> 1:08:21.191
What the hell you doin', man?

1:08:21.191 --> 1:08:24.512
You just gonna throw your arm
across my lap like you my ma?

1:08:24.512 --> 1:08:25.371
- Sorry, man.

1:08:25.371 --> 1:08:27.960
- Yo! What the hell you doin'
out in the street, little man?

1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:29.559
- We need a jump start.

1:08:29.559 --> 1:08:33.469
- Man, ain't no way that car's
startin', man. (chuckles)

1:08:33.469 --> 1:08:35.617
- [Jacob] We're trying
to get to the beach.

1:08:35.617 --> 1:08:36.911
- Fuck it.

1:08:36.911 --> 1:08:38.219
- Right there.

1:08:38.219 --> 1:08:39.611
Red is positive.

1:08:39.611 --> 1:08:41.111
- All right, so...

1:08:42.069 --> 1:08:46.031
(electricity crackles)

1:08:46.031 --> 1:08:46.863
All right.

1:08:47.857 --> 1:08:49.351
Let's give it a try.

1:08:49.351 --> 1:08:52.109
- Yo, rev it up! Rev it up!

1:08:52.109 --> 1:08:54.328
- Harold. Try it.

1:08:54.328 --> 1:08:55.719
(car starts)

1:08:55.719 --> 1:08:57.397
- How come he didn't get out the car?

1:08:57.397 --> 1:08:59.147
- He lives in there.

1:08:59.147 --> 1:09:00.439
- Shit. For real?

1:09:00.439 --> 1:09:01.272
- Yeah.

1:09:02.898 --> 1:09:04.568
- Anything we can do to help?

1:09:04.568 --> 1:09:05.818
- You just did.

1:09:10.376 --> 1:09:11.735
Thanks.

1:09:11.735 --> 1:09:13.568
- Anytime, little man.

1:09:19.564 --> 1:09:20.914
- [Harold] Hey, you got it done?

1:09:20.914 --> 1:09:22.914
- Yeah, it was 12 bucks.

1:09:25.225 --> 1:09:26.876
- I'll get you back.

1:09:26.876 --> 1:09:28.274
- Thanks.

1:09:28.274 --> 1:09:30.147
- Be careful, okay?

1:09:30.147 --> 1:09:34.495
Holy shit, with a cast
and everything there.

1:09:34.495 --> 1:09:36.905
All right, you wanna criss-cross
when tightening them.

1:09:36.905 --> 1:09:39.322
- What?
- Start with that one.

1:09:43.274 --> 1:09:46.264
See, you criss-cross, you
can get 'em tightened evenly.

1:09:46.264 --> 1:09:49.432
- All right.
- Now do the one above it.

1:09:51.474 --> 1:09:53.014
Good, man.

1:09:53.014 --> 1:09:55.663
Same thing, just do 'em
across from each other.

1:09:55.663 --> 1:09:56.973
- All right.

1:09:56.973 --> 1:09:59.366
- Okay, lower the jack.

1:09:59.366 --> 1:10:01.032
Easy, easy! No rush.

1:10:04.405 --> 1:10:09.023
You're a natural at this. (chuckles)

1:10:09.023 --> 1:10:11.714
All right, now you
wanna use the tire iron,

1:10:11.714 --> 1:10:13.937
put it on the lug nut and stomp it tight.

1:10:13.937 --> 1:10:14.937
- All right.

1:10:15.832 --> 1:10:17.624
- Put it on kinda sideways
so you can stomp on it.

1:10:17.624 --> 1:10:18.707
There you go.

1:10:19.742 --> 1:10:20.909
Nice. Perfect.

1:10:22.385 --> 1:10:25.010
Did you know I grew up in the
house that used to be here?

1:10:25.010 --> 1:10:26.430
- You lived here?
(somber music)

1:10:26.430 --> 1:10:29.263
- Yep. It all happened right here.

1:10:32.541 --> 1:10:34.589
- [Jacob] Is that why you came back?

1:10:34.589 --> 1:10:36.422
- I couldn't save her.

1:10:52.889 --> 1:10:57.889
(crickets chirp)
(ukulele music)

1:11:21.555 --> 1:11:24.055
(Randy sighs)

1:11:26.324 --> 1:11:27.157
- Hi.

1:11:28.605 --> 1:11:30.273
- Whoa, hey. Are you okay?

1:11:30.273 --> 1:11:35.243
- Oh, yeah. I, um, thought
you might want some dinner.

1:11:35.243 --> 1:11:36.833
- Wow.

1:11:36.833 --> 1:11:38.333
Thank you so much.

1:11:42.403 --> 1:11:44.570
- You gotta be kidding me.

1:11:45.523 --> 1:11:48.434
(sighs) The fuckin' retard?

1:11:48.434 --> 1:11:51.041
- I just wanted you to know

1:11:51.041 --> 1:11:52.458
how grateful I am

1:11:54.573 --> 1:11:57.823
for how nice you've been to Jake and...

1:12:00.262 --> 1:12:03.072
- [Harold] It's nothing.

1:12:03.072 --> 1:12:06.701
- It's been really hard
on him and (chuckles)

1:12:06.701 --> 1:12:09.702
since you've become friends...

1:12:09.702 --> 1:12:11.913
- I mean, it's nothin'.
(Jenny sighs)

1:12:11.913 --> 1:12:15.985
- He told me they were gonna
tow your car tomorrow, right?

1:12:15.985 --> 1:12:17.132
- [Harold] Yeah.

1:12:17.132 --> 1:12:19.422
- He wants to hit the road with you.

1:12:19.422 --> 1:12:21.151
(Harold chuckles)

1:12:21.151 --> 1:12:24.362
- [Harold] Don't worry. I told him no.

1:12:24.362 --> 1:12:27.448
- I'll figure out a way
to make it up to him.

1:12:27.448 --> 1:12:31.781
Maybe take a trip to my mom's
house for a couple of days.

1:12:31.781 --> 1:12:34.041
You know, road trip of our own.

1:12:34.041 --> 1:12:36.172
- [Harold] (chuckles) That's good.

1:12:36.172 --> 1:12:37.005
- So...

1:12:38.441 --> 1:12:40.219
What are you gonna do?

1:12:40.219 --> 1:12:42.097
Where are you gonna go?

1:12:42.097 --> 1:12:44.770
(melancholy music)

1:12:44.770 --> 1:12:46.338
- I'm not sure.

1:12:46.338 --> 1:12:47.941
I don't know.

1:12:47.941 --> 1:12:51.978
- Jake has been asking me
for a really long time and

1:12:51.978 --> 1:12:56.139
I guess if you could
make it up there, um...

1:12:56.139 --> 1:12:59.799
We've made up the back room for you.

1:12:59.799 --> 1:13:02.966
It's not much, but um, there is a bed,

1:13:05.741 --> 1:13:08.741
and you can just take it day by day.

1:13:11.781 --> 1:13:14.871
- That's, um... (chuckles)

1:13:14.871 --> 1:13:19.852
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

1:13:19.852 --> 1:13:21.484
I'll try.

1:13:21.484 --> 1:13:22.317
- Yeah?

1:13:23.762 --> 1:13:24.594
Okay.

1:13:26.621 --> 1:13:27.454
So...

1:13:28.682 --> 1:13:29.849
What can I do?

1:13:30.923 --> 1:13:32.284
- Um...

1:13:32.284 --> 1:13:34.617
I mean, I'll need more time.

1:13:36.304 --> 1:13:37.554
Maybe tomorrow.

1:13:39.246 --> 1:13:40.896
- I'm sorry. (chuckles)

1:13:40.896 --> 1:13:43.943
God, Harold, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1:13:43.943 --> 1:13:45.527
- Um, are you sure?

1:13:46.895 --> 1:13:48.222
- Believe me, if I could,

1:13:48.222 --> 1:13:51.472
I would jump out of this car right now.

1:13:54.852 --> 1:13:57.684
- Our house is always open to you.

1:13:59.576 --> 1:14:01.993
Please take care of yourself.

1:14:04.384 --> 1:14:05.217
- I will.

1:14:06.754 --> 1:14:08.183
Thanks.

1:14:08.183 --> 1:14:10.683
(Jenny sighs)

1:14:12.144 --> 1:14:14.811
(ominous music)

1:14:39.222 --> 1:14:41.431
(knocks)

1:14:41.431 --> 1:14:43.742
Did... Oh. (chuckles)

1:14:43.742 --> 1:14:46.670
Sorry, I thought it was Jenny.

1:14:46.670 --> 1:14:49.407
- [Bonny] Have you been talking to her?

1:14:49.407 --> 1:14:51.921
- Yeah, she been coming by a lot.

1:14:51.921 --> 1:14:55.231
Bringing groceries and laundry.

1:14:55.231 --> 1:14:58.452
And the kid's been coming by a lot too.

1:14:58.452 --> 1:15:00.772
- Do you think she'd
let you stay with her?

1:15:00.772 --> 1:15:02.441
Do you think you could
make it to her house?

1:15:02.441 --> 1:15:05.291
- I'm not moving in with them.

1:15:05.291 --> 1:15:07.723
I mean, we're just friends.

1:15:07.723 --> 1:15:09.061
It's too much to ask.

1:15:09.061 --> 1:15:11.674
- Harold, I meant just as friends.

1:15:11.674 --> 1:15:12.893
I mean, we have to do something.

1:15:12.893 --> 1:15:14.504
I keep going back and forth with Billy

1:15:14.504 --> 1:15:18.869
about having you committed
to a mental hospital.

1:15:18.869 --> 1:15:22.619
You don't think you can
make it to her house?

1:15:24.289 --> 1:15:27.289
(suspenseful music)

1:15:29.809 --> 1:15:31.032
- Oh, shit.

1:15:31.032 --> 1:15:32.673
- Shit.

1:15:32.673 --> 1:15:35.344
Shit, Harold. Harold, we have to go.

1:15:35.344 --> 1:15:37.242
You have to get out of this car.

1:15:37.242 --> 1:15:38.630
You have to try and get out.

1:15:38.630 --> 1:15:39.503
I'll be with you the whole time.

1:15:39.503 --> 1:15:42.782
I won't leave you, I promise.
Please, please, Harold.

1:15:42.782 --> 1:15:44.762
Please.
- I'm sorry.

1:15:44.762 --> 1:15:46.263
- Don't do this. Don't, don't, don't.

1:15:46.263 --> 1:15:47.592
Harold? Harold.

1:15:47.592 --> 1:15:49.142
- I'm sorry, I can't.

1:15:49.142 --> 1:15:50.442
I'm sorry, I can't.
- Please don't do this.

1:15:50.442 --> 1:15:51.275
Please.

1:15:51.275 --> 1:15:53.858
(somber music)

1:16:07.654 --> 1:16:08.737
- Back it up!

1:16:10.812 --> 1:16:13.844
I said back it up or I'll
haul your ass off to jail!

1:16:13.844 --> 1:16:18.428
Back it up!
(truck bleeps rhythmically)

1:16:20.582 --> 1:16:23.499
(truck door slams)

1:16:25.504 --> 1:16:28.087
(metal clacks)

1:16:34.572 --> 1:16:36.202
(horn honks)

1:16:36.202 --> 1:16:38.431
- [Daryl] Got a stowaway.

1:16:38.431 --> 1:16:39.264
(knocks)

1:16:39.264 --> 1:16:42.983
- Sir! I'm gonna need you
to get out of your car!

1:16:42.983 --> 1:16:44.434
- No.

1:16:44.434 --> 1:16:45.764
- Get out of the car, sir!
(knocks)

1:16:45.764 --> 1:16:47.383
- No!

1:16:47.383 --> 1:16:48.540
(knocks)

1:16:48.540 --> 1:16:50.161
- Hey! No, Jake!
- Leave him alone!

1:16:50.161 --> 1:16:52.320
- This is none of your
business. Go back inside.

1:16:52.320 --> 1:16:55.020
Daryl, lift it.
- I can't while he's inside.

1:16:55.020 --> 1:16:57.937
- [Jenkins] He'll get out. Lift it.

1:16:59.242 --> 1:17:01.742
(motor roars)

1:17:03.664 --> 1:17:04.844
(horn honks)

1:17:04.844 --> 1:17:05.773
(knocks)

1:17:05.773 --> 1:17:07.504
- Get out of the car now!
- No!

1:17:07.504 --> 1:17:08.575
Stop it!

1:17:08.575 --> 1:17:10.136
- Get out of the car!

1:17:10.136 --> 1:17:11.654
(heavy knocks)

1:17:11.654 --> 1:17:14.154
Get out of the car!
- Fuck you!

1:17:16.394 --> 1:17:17.793
- What're you doing?

1:17:17.793 --> 1:17:19.543
- We can't tow cars with people inside.

1:17:19.543 --> 1:17:20.835
It's against the law!

1:17:20.835 --> 1:17:22.695
- I am the law!

1:17:22.695 --> 1:17:24.670
I'm gonna come back
here with a court order!

1:17:24.670 --> 1:17:27.032
- (sobs) Stop.

1:17:27.032 --> 1:17:29.734
- And I'm gonna rip you out of this car!

1:17:29.734 --> 1:17:32.495
And I'm gonna drag you
down to the psych ward!

1:17:32.495 --> 1:17:36.412
You're gonna live in a
fuckin' straight jacket!

1:17:39.333 --> 1:17:40.166
- Harold?

1:17:42.874 --> 1:17:45.621
- Hey, y'all need to get
him out of here by tomorrow.

1:17:45.621 --> 1:17:49.621
I've dealt with this guy.
He's a fucking animal.

1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:54.040
(siren chirps)

1:17:54.040 --> 1:17:54.873
- Hal?

1:17:56.661 --> 1:17:58.327
- Harold, he's gone.

1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:03.690
Harold, please.

1:18:04.660 --> 1:18:05.493
He's gone.

1:18:09.646 --> 1:18:10.769
(knocks)

1:18:10.769 --> 1:18:13.637
Harold. Wake up, it's the big day.

1:18:13.637 --> 1:18:15.236
- I'm not quite awake yet.

1:18:15.236 --> 1:18:17.664
I gotta get outta here, kid.

1:18:17.664 --> 1:18:19.723
I got this.
(ukulele music)

1:18:19.723 --> 1:18:21.139
I got this thing.

1:18:25.403 --> 1:18:26.505
I mean, how it's worded,

1:18:26.505 --> 1:18:28.866
I'm pretty sure I need to get out of town.

1:18:28.866 --> 1:18:29.978
I'm hoping I can find some place

1:18:29.978 --> 1:18:33.311
where I can actually get out of the car.

1:18:36.656 --> 1:18:38.655
- [Jenny] Good mornin', my boys.

1:18:38.655 --> 1:18:40.883
- Morning!
- Morning.

1:18:40.883 --> 1:18:41.716
- Yeah.

1:18:42.746 --> 1:18:45.496
Here is the last of your laundry.

1:18:50.608 --> 1:18:52.858
We should go to Gam's
house for a couple of days.

1:18:52.858 --> 1:18:55.075
Like a trip of our own.

1:18:55.075 --> 1:18:57.505
- [Jacob] Can Harold come?

1:18:57.505 --> 1:18:59.588
- He can, if he wants to.

1:19:03.031 --> 1:19:06.665
(Jacob mimics gunfire)

1:19:06.665 --> 1:19:08.246
Hey, Harold!
- Yeah?

1:19:08.246 --> 1:19:10.816
- Do you know how to
get to Pass Christian?

1:19:10.816 --> 1:19:12.398
- Yeah, I think so.

1:19:16.768 --> 1:19:18.446
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:19:18.446 --> 1:19:20.568
- I wish I could come with you.

1:19:20.568 --> 1:19:22.686
- Next time. I promise.

1:19:22.686 --> 1:19:24.867
- Okay, don't leave without me.

1:19:24.867 --> 1:19:26.018
- I'll be right here.
- All right.

1:19:26.018 --> 1:19:27.507
Do you wanna finish up on the inside?

1:19:27.507 --> 1:19:28.848
- Sure, man.
- All right.

1:19:28.848 --> 1:19:30.657
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, no problem.

1:19:30.657 --> 1:19:31.919
- This is amazing.
- (chuckles) Yeah.

1:19:31.919 --> 1:19:34.171
- I haven't seen out of
these windows in months.

1:19:34.171 --> 1:19:37.088
- (chuckles) Yeah.

1:20:01.748 --> 1:20:04.865
- [Harold] Peanut
butter, satsumas, apples.

1:20:04.865 --> 1:20:06.698
Got my bread.
- Harold?

1:20:07.573 --> 1:20:08.823
- [Harold] Hey.

1:20:16.031 --> 1:20:18.362
- You can come to Houston.

1:20:18.362 --> 1:20:19.906
You could stay with me.

1:20:19.906 --> 1:20:21.462
(Harold chuckles)

1:20:21.462 --> 1:20:23.592
- [Harold] Really think
I need a road trip.

1:20:23.592 --> 1:20:25.505
- Where are you gonna go?

1:20:25.505 --> 1:20:29.522
- I don't know. I'm just gonna
go where the road takes me.

1:20:29.522 --> 1:20:31.389
- What about gas?

1:20:31.389 --> 1:20:32.581
- I'm all full.

1:20:32.581 --> 1:20:36.105
Kid's been filling me up,
three gallons at a time.

1:20:36.105 --> 1:20:37.282
- Food?

1:20:37.282 --> 1:20:39.782
- [Harold] I'm all stocked up.

1:20:41.523 --> 1:20:44.853
- I didn't think you
were really gonna leave.

1:20:44.853 --> 1:20:46.432
I've been fighting with
Billy the last few days

1:20:46.432 --> 1:20:50.445
over this fucking psych evaluation and...

1:20:50.445 --> 1:20:54.805
I don't know, maybe you
should get out of town.

1:20:54.805 --> 1:20:57.571
I really wish you could get
out of this car, Harold.

1:20:57.571 --> 1:21:00.844
I know you can't and I
understand. I just wish you could.

1:21:00.844 --> 1:21:03.315
- Hey, it's gonna be okay.

1:21:03.315 --> 1:21:04.148
All right?

1:21:05.132 --> 1:21:07.114
This is gonna be good for me.

1:21:07.114 --> 1:21:08.823
- Okay, don't go anywhere, okay?

1:21:08.823 --> 1:21:11.016
I'm gonna get you some cash.

1:21:11.016 --> 1:21:13.276
I've been giving money to
Miss Rita for groceries,

1:21:13.276 --> 1:21:15.675
and if you're really leaving,
I think you're gonna need it.

1:21:15.675 --> 1:21:18.861
Those full service gas
stations are really expensive.

1:21:18.861 --> 1:21:20.965
- [Harold] You've been
buying my groceries?

1:21:20.965 --> 1:21:23.184
- Don't go anywhere.

1:21:23.184 --> 1:21:26.018
- [Harold] I wouldn't think of it.

1:21:29.965 --> 1:21:32.715
(peaceful music)

1:21:42.041 --> 1:21:43.692
(distant siren wails)

1:21:43.692 --> 1:21:46.692
(tense piano music)

1:21:48.411 --> 1:21:49.327
- Oh, shit.

1:21:54.018 --> 1:21:57.184
(muffled siren wails)

1:22:01.371 --> 1:22:04.454
(mumbles to himself)

1:22:05.933 --> 1:22:08.683
(car door slams)

1:22:11.242 --> 1:22:12.754
(knocks)

1:22:12.754 --> 1:22:14.837
- I can see you, asshole!

1:22:16.202 --> 1:22:17.719
What? You're not gonna let me in?

1:22:17.719 --> 1:22:19.887
- I'm just about to leave!

1:22:23.473 --> 1:22:24.831
Oh, shit!

1:22:24.831 --> 1:22:27.615
- Oh, (chuckles) this is gonna be fun.

1:22:27.615 --> 1:22:28.912
- [Bonny] No, no, stop!

1:22:28.912 --> 1:22:30.601
- You, back up!
- You don't have to do this!

1:22:30.601 --> 1:22:32.012
He's leaving, he's leaving!

1:22:32.012 --> 1:22:34.262
- [Harold] Leave her alone!

1:22:36.451 --> 1:22:37.832
No!

1:22:37.832 --> 1:22:39.456
(thuds)

1:22:39.456 --> 1:22:40.692
- [Bonny] Stop, stop!

1:22:40.692 --> 1:22:43.460
(Harold screams)

1:22:43.460 --> 1:22:44.983
Stop!
- Let him go! Harold!

1:22:44.983 --> 1:22:47.859
- Jacob, go!
- Back it up!

1:22:47.859 --> 1:22:52.152
- Jesus, what you doin'?
- He didn't do anything!

1:22:52.152 --> 1:22:55.652
- Stop it!
(Harold groans)

1:22:56.851 --> 1:22:59.163
- I was gonna leave!

1:22:59.163 --> 1:23:00.663
I was gonna leave!

1:23:02.714 --> 1:23:04.714
(pants)

1:23:07.930 --> 1:23:09.930
(gasps)

1:23:12.366 --> 1:23:14.782
(car starts)

1:23:20.425 --> 1:23:22.937
- Hey, bud. Are you about ready?

1:23:22.937 --> 1:23:23.770
- Yeah.

1:23:27.871 --> 1:23:31.299
(Jenny chuckles)

1:23:31.299 --> 1:23:33.419
- Oh, come on. (chuckles)

1:23:33.419 --> 1:23:36.938
I know you wanted to go on that trip, but,

1:23:36.938 --> 1:23:39.105
I can't let you, I mean...

1:23:40.719 --> 1:23:42.090
I love you.

1:23:42.090 --> 1:23:45.757
And I know Harold is a
really good guy, but,

1:23:46.719 --> 1:23:50.748
I would be a bad mom if I
let you go on a trip at 13.

1:23:50.748 --> 1:23:54.249
Besides, we've got a road
trip of our own. (chuckles)

1:23:54.249 --> 1:23:58.582
Yeah and Gammy's house is
really close to the beach.

1:23:59.508 --> 1:24:04.038
And don't forget to pack
up all of your video games,

1:24:04.038 --> 1:24:06.045
'cause you can play as much as you want.

1:24:06.045 --> 1:24:07.878
This is your vacation.

1:24:08.898 --> 1:24:09.840
(phone rings)

1:24:09.840 --> 1:24:13.594
Oh! I bet that's Gammy right
now wondering where we're at.

1:24:13.594 --> 1:24:16.094
(phone rings)

1:24:18.341 --> 1:24:19.650
(phone rings)

1:24:19.650 --> 1:24:21.732
(suspenseful music)

1:24:21.732 --> 1:24:23.338
(phone rings)

1:24:23.338 --> 1:24:26.389
(door creaks)

1:24:26.389 --> 1:24:28.100
- Where the hell are you goin'?

1:24:28.100 --> 1:24:29.897
- No, none of your business.
What're you doing here?

1:24:29.897 --> 1:24:32.377
- Everything under this
house is my business.

1:24:32.377 --> 1:24:34.505
- Leave me alone. Mom!
- Y'all leaving me, hm?

1:24:34.505 --> 1:24:36.106
Going with that freak?

1:24:36.106 --> 1:24:38.067
(Jacob grunts and chokes)

1:24:38.067 --> 1:24:39.734
Don't cross me, boy.

1:24:42.627 --> 1:24:45.210
(Jacob coughs)

1:24:48.466 --> 1:24:49.812
- [Jenny] (gasps) Oh, my god, Mom!

1:24:49.812 --> 1:24:54.804
(slap)
(Randy grunts)

1:24:54.804 --> 1:24:56.304
- Where you goin'?

1:24:57.330 --> 1:24:59.202
Where are you goin', hm?

1:24:59.202 --> 1:25:00.285
- Randy!
- Hm?

1:25:02.210 --> 1:25:03.044
Where are you-

1:25:03.044 --> 1:25:05.123
- What're you doing here, Randy?

1:25:05.123 --> 1:25:07.442
- Where are you going?
- I have a restraining-

1:25:07.442 --> 1:25:08.942
- Don't lie to me!

1:25:11.389 --> 1:25:13.540
I saw Jacob packing his bag, hm?

1:25:13.540 --> 1:25:15.660
Are you heading off with that freak, huh?

1:25:15.660 --> 1:25:16.535
- No, no!

1:25:16.535 --> 1:25:19.261
- How dare you make a fool out of me.

1:25:19.261 --> 1:25:21.844
(Jacob coughs)

1:25:27.571 --> 1:25:30.654
(lively metal music)

1:25:34.360 --> 1:25:36.780
- Harold, Randy's here. We need help.

1:25:36.780 --> 1:25:38.280
(tense music)

1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:39.868
Harold!

1:25:39.868 --> 1:25:41.951
(coughs)

1:25:45.934 --> 1:25:48.466
- No, Randy.
- Now you sit down.

1:25:48.466 --> 1:25:49.799
And you shut up.

1:25:51.197 --> 1:25:52.666
(Jacob screams)
(groans)

1:25:52.666 --> 1:25:55.467
(slap)
- Oh, my god!

1:25:55.467 --> 1:25:58.041
(gun cocks)
(pants)

1:25:58.041 --> 1:26:01.459
- Sit down, or I'm really gonna hurt him.

1:26:03.516 --> 1:26:05.440
(grunts)
(Jacob groans)

1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:08.865
- No, Randy, you fucking leave him alone!

1:26:08.865 --> 1:26:10.574
(Jacob groans)

1:26:10.574 --> 1:26:12.414
- Huh? With that smart mouth, huh?

1:26:12.414 --> 1:26:15.123
- Randy, leave us alone!
- Huh!

1:26:15.123 --> 1:26:16.565
(slap)
- No!

1:26:16.565 --> 1:26:18.396
You leave him alone.

1:26:18.396 --> 1:26:21.661
(Jacob pants)

1:26:21.661 --> 1:26:25.161
(Jacob groans and coughs)

1:26:30.243 --> 1:26:33.280
(dog barks)

1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:36.670
- [Jacob] Harold, he's
killing us. We need help.

1:26:36.670 --> 1:26:37.503
- Jacob?

1:26:37.503 --> 1:26:40.309
- [Jacob] Harold, please
help us! He's killing us!

1:26:40.309 --> 1:26:41.143
- Jacob!

1:26:42.841 --> 1:26:43.674
Jacob!

1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:49.776
(car starts)
(tense music)

1:26:49.776 --> 1:26:51.286
- You see what he made me do?

1:26:51.286 --> 1:26:54.888
You see? You see what you made me do, hm?

1:26:54.888 --> 1:26:56.494
Don't you know that I love you?

1:26:56.494 --> 1:26:58.567
Are you too stupid to realize that, huh?

1:26:58.567 --> 1:27:00.986
Why are you doing this to me?
- I know.

1:27:00.986 --> 1:27:03.903
(car engine roars)

1:27:05.464 --> 1:27:08.130
(tires screech)

1:27:10.647 --> 1:27:11.835
- Jacob!

1:27:11.835 --> 1:27:12.668
Jacob!

1:27:13.835 --> 1:27:15.886
- I love you.
- You love me?

1:27:15.886 --> 1:27:17.496
See, I thought, I thought-
- I do!

1:27:17.496 --> 1:27:21.207
- I thought you said you wanted
a happy little family right?

1:27:21.207 --> 1:27:22.666
Mm-hm, mm-hm?
- We're a family.

1:27:22.666 --> 1:27:25.148
- Yeah? Are you happy, Jen?

1:27:25.148 --> 1:27:26.315
Are you happy?

1:27:27.618 --> 1:27:29.347
Are you happy?
- I'm so happy.

1:27:29.347 --> 1:27:32.268
- God. Why can't you get it
through your thick skull?

1:27:32.268 --> 1:27:33.184
I love you.

1:27:34.337 --> 1:27:35.657
- Help!

1:27:35.657 --> 1:27:37.298
Help!

1:27:37.298 --> 1:27:39.034
(pants)

1:27:39.034 --> 1:27:39.867
Fuck it.

1:27:42.107 --> 1:27:45.297
(Jenny sobs)
(tense music)

1:27:45.297 --> 1:27:46.380
- Baby, baby.

1:27:48.188 --> 1:27:49.886
I told you...

1:27:49.886 --> 1:27:50.954
(gun cocks)

1:27:50.954 --> 1:27:55.708
If you ever got a restraining
order, I was gonna kill you.

1:27:55.708 --> 1:27:57.566
(thud)
(groans)

1:27:57.566 --> 1:27:59.473
Speak of the retard!

1:27:59.473 --> 1:28:01.327
- Come on, you son of a bitch!
(Randy grunts)

1:28:01.327 --> 1:28:03.244
(thud)

1:28:04.407 --> 1:28:07.344
- You trying to steal my
family, you fuckin' freak?

1:28:07.344 --> 1:28:08.177
- No!

1:28:09.646 --> 1:28:11.146
No, you bastard!

1:28:11.146 --> 1:28:13.834
(Randy groans)

1:28:13.834 --> 1:28:15.285
- Is he okay?

1:28:15.285 --> 1:28:17.202
- [Jenny] Oh, baby! No.

1:28:18.246 --> 1:28:19.433
- [Paramedic] Ma'am, we're going to need

1:28:19.433 --> 1:28:20.356
to take a look at you.

1:28:20.356 --> 1:28:22.914
- I said I'm fine. You take care of him.

1:28:22.914 --> 1:28:25.414
(Jacob pants)

1:28:28.523 --> 1:28:30.816
- You're gonna be okay, man.

1:28:30.816 --> 1:28:32.764
Take care of him. He's a special kid.

1:28:32.764 --> 1:28:35.466
(Jacob pants)

1:28:35.466 --> 1:28:37.118
- Harold.
- It's gonna be all right.

1:28:37.118 --> 1:28:38.496
Get in there with him.

1:28:38.496 --> 1:28:39.826
- Ready?

1:28:39.826 --> 1:28:41.277
- [Rita] Harold!

1:28:41.277 --> 1:28:42.110
Harold!

1:28:43.976 --> 1:28:45.893
You're out of your car!

1:28:47.243 --> 1:28:51.317
- (chuckles) I guess I am.
- Oh, Harold.

1:28:51.317 --> 1:28:54.234
- (chuckles) I am.

1:28:57.106 --> 1:28:59.154
- I knew you could do it, Hal.

1:28:59.154 --> 1:29:01.827
I knew you could get out of your car.

1:29:01.827 --> 1:29:03.057
(Harold chuckles)

1:29:03.057 --> 1:29:04.057
- Thank you.

1:29:05.706 --> 1:29:06.539
- Harold!

1:29:07.657 --> 1:29:10.403
We're not leaving here without you.

1:29:10.403 --> 1:29:11.616
- I gotta go.

1:29:11.616 --> 1:29:13.710
- Good for you, Hal.

1:29:13.710 --> 1:29:16.128
Your momma would be so proud.

1:29:19.965 --> 1:29:22.734
