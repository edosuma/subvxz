And I'm gonna
talk to the punks.

09:40.110 --> 09:42.312
They can help me find
Naldo's dad's band.

09:42.312 --> 09:44.915
Ah, the classic
Shelby and Cyd.

09:44.915 --> 09:47.888
I'll do the homework
while you do that
thing you want to do.

09:51.021 --> 09:53.894
Hey, you ever heard
of the band called
The Stench?

09:53.894 --> 09:56.897
Their music makes me
want to lick the inside
of a trashcan

09:56.897 --> 09:59.199
so my mouth knows
how my ears feel.

10:01.231 --> 10:03.073
That thing you
just described

10:03.073 --> 10:04.805
was very gross.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.907
I like it.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.278
You got a real
dumpster mouth
on you.

10:08.278 --> 10:10.841
You look
just like Naldo.

10:10.841 --> 10:12.182
You're
Mr. Montoya!

10:12.182 --> 10:14.184
"Mr. Montoya."

10:14.184 --> 10:17.888
You punks could learn
a thing or two about respect
from Dumpster Mouth here.

10:17.888 --> 10:19.990
A punk nickname?
I love it!

10:19.990 --> 10:22.192
Cool it, Cyd. Act like
you've been there before.

10:24.054 --> 10:27.027
I'm Rennie, lead singer
of The Stench.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.228
You should
check us out.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.130
We're playing a gig here
in the commons later.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.062
Whoa, whoa!
What is this?

10:32.062 --> 10:34.004
No! Your band's
not playing

10:34.004 --> 10:35.305
that punk music
in my commons.

10:35.305 --> 10:36.967
That's not fair.
The disco kids

10:36.967 --> 10:38.939
listen to their music
in the commons.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.942
That's because disco
is the grooviest music
ever made.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.844
It should be shared
with the world

10:43.844 --> 10:45.876
like love,
wood paneling,

10:45.876 --> 10:49.149
and this great new
sugar substitute
called saccharin.

10:51.221 --> 10:54.324
Now, get outta here!
You're takin' up prime
boogie real estate.

10:54.324 --> 10:56.927
No. I came here
to see The Stench!

10:56.927 --> 10:58.088
I'm gonna see
The Stench!

10:58.088 --> 11:00.931
ALL: Yeah.
Oh, you can
see The Stench.

11:00.931 --> 11:02.933
ALL: Yeah.
In detention!

11:02.933 --> 11:04.194
ALL: Aw.

11:04.194 --> 11:05.966
Nobody blame
themselves.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.938
We all walked
right into that.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.302
Shelby! We have to
jump back... Shelby!

11:13.974 --> 11:16.146
Okay, now, let's practice
your disco chant.

Ooh! Ooh!

11:23.113 --> 11:27.087
Woo! Woo!

11:27.087 --> 11:29.119
Maybe just keep
your mouth closed
and keep dancing?

11:29.119 --> 11:30.290
I can totally
do that.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.369
Good work, the tachyon
enclosure's coming along
nicely, Renaldo.

11:39.369 --> 11:42.332
It's very important that we
protect the particles
from contamination.

11:42.332 --> 11:45.135
Thanks.
I had to eat a lot of
egg salad sandwiches

11:45.135 --> 11:46.977
to get enough
plastic wrap.

11:46.977 --> 11:49.910
Why didn't you just
buy a lot of plastic wrap?

11:49.910 --> 11:52.012
I wanted to eat a lot of
egg salad sandwiches.

11:53.183 --> 11:54.384
Renaldo,
look!

11:54.384 --> 11:56.216
Another picture
of the girls.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.348
BARRY: They're not
together anymore.

11:58.348 --> 12:01.251
Shelby and Cyd's
tachyon signatures
are drifting apart.

12:01.251 --> 12:04.324
The electromagnetic bond
between them is dissipating.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.056
Barry,
I'm scared.

12:06.056 --> 12:07.397
Would it be awkward
if I asked you to hold me?

12:07.397 --> 12:09.329
It sure would,
buddy.
Then I won't ask.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.363
Oh, no.

12:13.363 --> 12:16.206
The girls have lost
their connection
to each other.

12:16.206 --> 12:18.068
What if they
forget each other?

12:18.068 --> 12:19.209
How will they
jump back?

12:28.018 --> 12:29.179
Guys,
check it out.

12:29.179 --> 12:31.421
I think I mastered
my disco chant.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.007
I also know
you're not a mama.

That's just what
I call chicks.

I call foxes.

I call babes.

13:31.481 --> 13:33.413
Which is what
I call you.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.347
No...
This is so weird.

just like Barry.

13:38.488 --> 13:41.321
Who's Barry?
I'm Disco Dennis.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.353
But Barry's a pretty
outta sight name, though.

13:43.353 --> 13:45.525
Maybe I'll call
my son that one day.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.028

I just named Barry!

I remember that?

14:42.312 --> 14:43.453

14:43.453 --> 14:44.554
I thought "funk"
was a good thing.

14:44.554 --> 14:46.156
Except when
it's a bad thing.

14:46.156 --> 14:48.158
You see, funk is
an auto-antonym,

14:48.158 --> 14:50.190
where the same word
also means its opposite.

bad meaning good.

His mother?

19:16.786 --> 19:18.588
What happened when
I was in detention?

19:18.588 --> 19:19.789
Uh, nothing happened.

19:19.789 --> 19:23.463
But let's just say
Disco Dennis has
got some moves.

19:24.834 --> 19:27.697
Well, thanks to your
ill-advised trip
outside your lifetime,

19:27.697 --> 19:30.840
we managed to collect
some tachyon particles,

19:30.840 --> 19:33.873
which should allow us
to make great strides
in our time travel research.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.905
That's great, Barry.
Really awesome.

19:35.905 --> 19:37.777
Should we ask him what
tachyon particles are?

19:37.777 --> 19:39.549
Nah, then he'll
just explain it.

19:40.810 --> 19:42.712
Hey, guys,

19:42.712 --> 19:44.654
check out
the new picture
in the yearbook.

19:44.654 --> 19:47.757
No way.
The punks and discos
dancing with each other.

19:47.757 --> 19:49.889
We brought them
together...

19:49.889 --> 19:51.421
We should
be there for that!

19:51.421 --> 19:52.592
We earned
that boogie.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.464
Stay together!
Stay away from my dad!

CYD: I can't believe
how awesome that was.

21:19.549 --> 21:22.752
I can't believe
we all knew the exact
same dance moves.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.818
(CHUCKLING)

21:28.818 --> 21:30.990
If we had
that much fun
in the past,

think of all the fun
we'll have in the future.

come on!

There's those footsteps!
Quick, touch my hand!

21:41.801 --> 21:44.634
No! I'm tired
of being scared
of this future lab.

21:44.634 --> 21:46.476
I want to see what
this guy's up to.

Too scary!

on that guy's suit?

21:59.949 --> 22:01.721
Yeah. What do you
think it was?

22:01.721 --> 22:02.952
I don't know.

22:02.952 --> 22:04.724
But now,
we have a clue.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.726
We have to figure out
