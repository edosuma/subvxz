WEBVTT

02:11:20.444 --> 02:11:22.435
Seriously.
Keep an eye on this guy.

02:11:22.513 --> 02:11:24.880
My gut instinct says he's got
a future in the NHL.

02:11:24.949 --> 02:11:25.814
Dan.

02:11:25.883 --> 02:11:27.715
Kim Galey can't stop
breaking records,

02:11:27.785 --> 02:11:30.550
and these days, the only records
she's breaking are mostly her own.

02:11:30.621 --> 02:11:33.488
Our Jennifer Crystal caught up
with Kim in Baton Rouge.

02:11:33.557 --> 02:11:34.854
<i>Dave: 30 seconds back.</i>

02:11:34.925 --> 02:11:36.120
-- A little recon.
-- No.

02:11:36.193 --> 02:11:37.683
-- A little recon is all I'm asking.
-- No.

02:11:37.761 --> 02:11:39.422
-- You go up there, you
introduce yourself, -- No.

02:11:39.497 --> 02:11:40.658
-- And you recommend me.
-- No.

02:11:40.731 --> 02:11:42.130
I recommend you?

02:11:42.199 --> 02:11:43.325
-- Yes.
-- No.

02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:44.196
Casey, come on.

02:11:44.268 --> 02:11:46.896
You want me to walk into the
office of a woman I don't know,

02:11:46.971 --> 02:11:48.530
a woman who has turned you down

02:11:48.606 --> 02:11:51.507
each and every one of the
17 times you've asked her out,

02:11:51.575 --> 02:11:52.770
and recommend you?

02:11:52.843 --> 02:11:53.833
-- Yes.
-- No.

02:11:53.911 --> 02:11:55.970
You think I'm becoming obsessed
with her?

02:11:56.046 --> 02:11:56.569
Yes.

02:11:56.647 --> 02:11:57.409
-- You do?
-- Yes.

02:11:57.481 --> 02:11:59.279
-- You think it's 'cause she
won't go out with me? -- Yes.

02:11:59.350 --> 02:12:00.875
-- You think it's getting distracting?
-- Yes.

02:12:00.951 --> 02:12:02.385
-- I'm not distracted.
-- Really?

02:12:02.453 --> 02:12:03.784
-- <i>I'm not.</i>
-- <i>Dave: Back in 10.</i>

02:12:03.854 --> 02:12:05.788
-- And you won't do recon?
-- No.

02:12:05.856 --> 02:12:06.846
Don't you think
I'd do it for you?

02:12:06.924 --> 02:12:07.914
Oh, I know you wouldn't.

02:12:07.992 --> 02:12:10.757
-- I'm not distracted.
-- In <i>3...2...</i>

02:12:10.828 --> 02:12:12.057
The sophomore sensation

02:12:12.129 --> 02:12:14.757
accredits her agility and quick
first step to her father,

02:12:14.832 --> 02:12:16.857
who used to take her to
a neighborhood park

02:12:16.934 --> 02:12:18.231
all covered with cheese.

02:12:18.302 --> 02:12:20.794
We'll be bringing you part two
of that story tomorrow night.

02:12:20.871 --> 02:12:22.032
Casey.

02:12:22.106 --> 02:12:24.131
The San Diego Padres...

02:12:24.208 --> 02:12:26.438
-- Did he just say "cheese"?
-- He did just say "cheese."

02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:27.705
What was it supposed to be?

02:12:27.778 --> 02:12:29.542
-- <i>What was it supposed to be?</i>
-- <i>Let me find it.</i>

02:12:29.613 --> 02:12:30.808
A park all covered with cheese?

02:12:30.881 --> 02:12:33.077
I had three people
talking in my ear.

02:12:33.150 --> 02:12:34.914
-- I can't <i>find it. What block?</i>
-- <i>We just did it.</i>

02:12:34.985 --> 02:12:36.419
-- The 50s.
-- 55.

02:12:36.487 --> 02:12:38.114
How about a park
all covered with trees?

02:12:38.188 --> 02:12:39.747
-- He said "cheese"?
-- Welcome <i>to</i> the <i>show.</i>

02:12:39.823 --> 02:12:42.622
...for double-A Scottsdale,
with 86 strikeouts.

02:12:42.693 --> 02:12:46.186
You're watching "Sports Night"
on CSC, so come on back.

02:12:46.263 --> 02:12:46.991
<i>We're out.</i>

02:12:47.064 --> 02:12:48.395
Two minutes back.

02:12:48.465 --> 02:12:51.162
The neighborhood park
all covered with cheese?

02:12:51.235 --> 02:12:53.329
-- I said "cheese"?
-- You said "cheese."

02:12:53.404 --> 02:12:55.805
Dana, did I say,
"park all covered with cheese"?

02:12:55.873 --> 02:12:57.637
There's a consensus, yes.

02:12:58.842 --> 02:13:00.105
What are you lookin' at?

02:13:00.177 --> 02:13:01.144
I'm here for you, man.

02:13:01.211 --> 02:13:02.645
Let me fix it
when we come back.

02:13:02.713 --> 02:13:04.442
Fix it when we come back.

02:13:04.515 --> 02:13:05.676
Are we sure it's wrong?

02:13:05.749 --> 02:13:07.683
Are we sure the park
<i>isn't</i> all covered with cheese?

02:13:07.751 --> 02:13:08.843
It's covered with trees,
and shut up.

02:13:08.919 --> 02:13:11.581
I was just about to change
my mind and recommend you.

02:13:11.655 --> 02:13:13.419
-- Really?
-- No.

02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:15.584
Dana, Casey's being mean to me.

02:13:15.659 --> 02:13:17.991
Casey, be nice to Dan.

02:13:18.062 --> 02:13:19.257
"The sophomore sensation

02:13:19.330 --> 02:13:21.389
"accredits her agility and quick
first step to her father,

02:13:21.465 --> 02:13:23.991

02:13:24.068 --> 02:13:25.365
[Chuckling ] Dana...

02:13:25.436 --> 02:13:27.461
we got all kinds of
sentence construction here.

02:13:27.538 --> 02:13:28.869
I think he's gonna
have to explain

02:13:28.939 --> 02:13:31.965
that it's the park that's covered
with cheese and not the father.

02:13:32.042 --> 02:13:33.441
This is an unforgiving room.

02:13:33.510 --> 02:13:34.909
Plus it's a little hard
to figure

02:13:34.979 --> 02:13:36.640
how running through cheese
helped the kid

02:13:36.714 --> 02:13:38.273
with her agility
and quick first step.

02:13:38.349 --> 02:13:40.010
Thank you, everyone.

02:13:44.755 --> 02:13:45.722
Boy, will I be happy

02:13:45.789 --> 02:13:46.756
when someone gets me

02:13:46.824 --> 02:13:47.985
the film on Albert Belle.

02:13:48.058 --> 02:13:49.617
That would be a happy moment
for me.

02:13:49.693 --> 02:13:50.956
-- Guess what.
-- What?

02:13:51.028 --> 02:13:52.723
-- I'm going snorkeling.
-- Seriously.

02:13:52.796 --> 02:13:54.560
Don't anyone bring me
the Albert Belle film

02:13:54.632 --> 02:13:56.657
that I asked for,
'cause I'll get emotional.

02:13:56.734 --> 02:13:57.667
Did you hear me?

02:13:57.735 --> 02:13:58.793
Yeah, you're going snorkeling.

02:13:58.869 --> 02:14:02.203
I'm going snorkeling
off the island of Latok.

02:14:02.272 --> 02:14:04.104
-- Where's Latok?
-- I do not know.

02:14:04.174 --> 02:14:07.007
Also, if anybody brought me the
Albert Belle film, it would be bad,

02:14:07.077 --> 02:14:08.670
'cause I'd be able
to work right now.

02:14:08.746 --> 02:14:10.714
-- Don't you want to know when I'm going?
-- When are you going?

02:14:10.781 --> 02:14:12.943
Week after next,
weekend after next --

02:14:13.017 --> 02:14:14.451
next Friday through
next Sunday.

02:14:14.518 --> 02:14:16.816
-- You seem pretty excited.
-- You bet I'm excited.

02:14:16.887 --> 02:14:18.082
I'm assuming this is
with Gordon.

02:14:18.155 --> 02:14:19.645
He asked me last night.

02:14:19.723 --> 02:14:20.747
Just the two of you?

02:14:20.824 --> 02:14:23.486
Just the two of us...
And three other couples.

02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:25.688
-- What does that sound like to you?
-- A total of four couples.

02:14:25.763 --> 02:14:27.197
Do you think it's a good sign?

02:14:27.264 --> 02:14:29.596
That he asked you
to go snorkeling?

02:14:29.667 --> 02:14:30.862
Yes.

02:14:30.934 --> 02:14:32.095
Yes.

02:14:32.169 --> 02:14:32.863
Me too.

02:14:32.936 --> 02:14:34.836
Is there anything else?

02:14:34.905 --> 02:14:36.202
It sounds good, doesn't it?

02:14:36.273 --> 02:14:37.399
The snorkeling?

02:14:37.474 --> 02:14:40.239
That he <i>asked</i> me,
just the two of us --

02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:43.007
just the eight of us --
off the island of Latok.

02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:46.175
Sounds like a lot of people are gonna be having
sex with a lot of other people who aren't me.

02:14:46.250 --> 02:14:47.479
[Laughs] That's right.

02:14:47.551 --> 02:14:48.484
Sounds good.

02:14:48.552 --> 02:14:49.485
Hey.

02:14:49.553 --> 02:14:50.816
-- Natalie.
-- Yes, ma'am.

02:14:50.888 --> 02:14:52.788
-- I'm going snorkeling.
-- What do you mean?

02:14:52.856 --> 02:14:54.756
Gordon asked me
to go snorkeling.

02:14:54.825 --> 02:14:57.453
-- Is he going, too?
-- Of course he's -- Yes.

02:14:57.528 --> 02:14:59.155
Do you think he called me
and said,

02:14:59.229 --> 02:15:01.425
"Dana, I want you to go
away from me and snorkel"?

02:15:01.498 --> 02:15:03.296
God, you don't think
that's what he meant, do you?

02:15:03.367 --> 02:15:05.267
Absolutely not.
I'm going snorkeling.

02:15:05.335 --> 02:15:06.268
That's great.

02:15:06.336 --> 02:15:07.269
-- Isn't it?
-- Yes.

02:15:07.337 --> 02:15:08.668
-- Isn't it just great?
-- It really is.

02:15:08.739 --> 02:15:10.332
-- I'm going snorkeling.
-- Are you okay?

02:15:10.407 --> 02:15:11.738
-- You have to help me.
-- Why?

02:15:11.809 --> 02:15:12.833
'Cause I'm going snorkeling.

02:15:12.910 --> 02:15:14.674
-- What's the problem?
-- I can't snorkel.

02:15:14.745 --> 02:15:16.213
-- Sure, you can.
-- No, I can't.

02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:18.510
-- I've seen you swim.
-- I swim just fine.

02:15:18.582 --> 02:15:20.482
-- And you like the water. --
I like the water very much.

02:15:22.586 --> 02:15:24.918
-- They really, really won't.
-- Why not?

02:15:24.988 --> 02:15:27.082
I'm afraid of fish.

02:15:27.157 --> 02:15:29.387
-- You're afraid of fish? --
I'm afraid of fish, Natalie.

02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:31.451
Fish frighten me
in a very real way.

02:15:31.528 --> 02:15:34.088
-- Have you had a bad
experience with fish? -- No.

02:15:34.164 --> 02:15:35.325
Then what's the --

02:15:35.399 --> 02:15:36.958
Well, it's just
the way it is.

02:15:37.034 --> 02:15:39.264
Well, that puts you
in a bit of a pickle.

02:15:39.336 --> 02:15:41.202
Well, what do you think
I can do?

02:15:41.271 --> 02:15:42.761
I don't even know
what the problem is.

02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:45.070
-- Then why did you say I was in a pickle?
-- It's fun to say.

02:15:45.142 --> 02:15:48.009
I can't help but notice that
you're not that happy for me.

02:15:48.078 --> 02:15:50.376
Gordon asked me to spend
the weekend with him

02:15:50.447 --> 02:15:51.812
when the smart money said

02:15:51.882 --> 02:15:53.907
he was gonna drop me
like a sack of rocks,

02:15:53.984 --> 02:15:56.248
-- and you don't seem to be that happy.
-- I'm happy.

02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:57.685
I thought maybe you were gonna
say I shouldn't go,

02:15:57.755 --> 02:15:58.916
'cause I'm not really
in love with Gordon.

02:15:58.989 --> 02:16:01.117
-- And secretly in love with Casey?
-- Yeah.

02:16:01.191 --> 02:16:02.352
No.

02:16:02.426 --> 02:16:04.053
I thought you were gonna
say that.

02:16:04.128 --> 02:16:05.596
-- I'm not.
-- I'm glad.

02:16:05.662 --> 02:16:07.027
-- I'm dropping it.
-- Thank you.

02:16:07.097 --> 02:16:10.123
From now on, you are no longer
secretly in love with Casey.

02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:11.133
Huh.

02:16:11.201 --> 02:16:12.999
So...what do I do?

02:16:13.070 --> 02:16:14.333
Uh, about the fish?

02:16:14.404 --> 02:16:15.963
Yes.

02:16:16.039 --> 02:16:19.009
Well, how about when everyone
goes snorkeling,

02:16:19.076 --> 02:16:20.669
you, you know,
don't go snorkeling?

02:16:20.744 --> 02:16:21.870
The whole point of this

02:16:21.945 --> 02:16:24.505
is that Gordon feels I'm not
giving enough of myself.

02:16:24.581 --> 02:16:26.242
Gordon loves snorkeling.

02:16:26.316 --> 02:16:27.875
He's asked me
to go snorkeling,

02:16:27.951 --> 02:16:30.443
so when everyone goes snorkeling,
I have to go snorkeling.

02:16:30.521 --> 02:16:32.683
Well, how about,
when everyone goes snorkeling,

02:16:32.755 --> 02:16:35.316
you stay here in New York with
Casey, whom you secretly love.

02:16:35.392 --> 02:16:37.053
[Groans] I should have
seen that coming.

02:16:37.127 --> 02:16:38.492
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

02:16:38.562 --> 02:16:39.620
<i>She's never seen the show.</i>

02:16:39.696 --> 02:16:40.629
Yes.

02:16:40.697 --> 02:16:42.290
Don't you find that remarkable?

02:16:42.366 --> 02:16:43.389
Okay.

02:16:43.467 --> 02:16:44.593
She works for CSC.

02:16:44.668 --> 02:16:46.066
She works for
Continental Corp.

02:16:46.136 --> 02:16:48.503
-- Aren't we one big family? --
I like to think of us that way.

02:16:48.572 --> 02:16:50.165
And she's never seen the show.

02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:51.730
Isn't there someone
you could call?

02:16:51.808 --> 02:16:52.776
Like who?

02:16:52.843 --> 02:16:54.311
A grievance hotline?

02:16:54.378 --> 02:16:56.675
I'd like you
to take this seriously.

02:16:56.746 --> 02:16:58.441
I don't think
that's gonna happen, do you?

02:16:58.514 --> 02:17:01.109
I just think if she saw me
on the show, she would like me.

02:17:01.184 --> 02:17:04.280
I'm my best on the show.
It's what I want people to see.

02:17:04.353 --> 02:17:06.549
I put all day into one hour,
and I'm proud of it,

02:17:06.623 --> 02:17:07.852
but she won't watch
the show.

02:17:07.924 --> 02:17:09.859
I'm really troubled by that.

02:17:09.927 --> 02:17:11.520
Yeah, I can tell
you're all broken up.

02:17:11.594 --> 02:17:13.495
How many times have you
approached this woman?

02:17:13.564 --> 02:17:14.496
Altogether?

02:17:14.565 --> 02:17:16.329
Yes.

02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:17.093
Nine times.

02:17:17.166 --> 02:17:18.931
Including the flowers?

02:17:19.002 --> 02:17:20.163
12 times.

02:17:20.236 --> 02:17:21.362
And waiting by the elevator?

02:17:21.438 --> 02:17:23.429
15 times.

02:17:23.507 --> 02:17:24.701
-- Okay, now --
-- 17 times.

02:17:24.775 --> 02:17:26.869
-- 17 times.
-- Yes.

02:17:26.943 --> 02:17:29.003
And what has she said
each time?

02:17:29.079 --> 02:17:31.411
Well, it usually runs
something along the lines of,

02:17:31.481 --> 02:17:33.779
"Dan, I'm not interested."

02:17:33.851 --> 02:17:34.817
Okay.

02:17:34.885 --> 02:17:37.115
"Dan, you're a nice guy,
but I'm just not interested."

02:17:37.187 --> 02:17:40.486
So let me ask -- have you explored the
possibility that she's not interested?

02:17:40.557 --> 02:17:42.651
Oh, I'm well aware
that she's not interested.

02:17:42.726 --> 02:17:44.626
Well, have you tried
showing her how you feel, Danny?

02:17:44.695 --> 02:17:46.959
I mean, have you tried doing it
at least...20 times?

02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:49.157
I will not be the subject
of your mockery.

02:17:49.233 --> 02:17:51.166
Oh, I think you shall.

02:17:51.235 --> 02:17:52.964
-- Jeremy.
-- What do you need?

02:17:53.036 --> 02:17:54.434
-- Hmm?
-- You called me.

02:17:54.504 --> 02:17:56.097
-- Yes.
-- What do you need?

02:17:56.173 --> 02:17:58.471
-- Exactly. -- Don't
listen to him, Jeremy.

02:17:58.541 --> 02:18:00.340
Nobody's talking to you!

02:18:01.745 --> 02:18:02.575
Hi.

02:18:02.646 --> 02:18:04.080
How are you doin'?

02:18:04.147 --> 02:18:05.808
I need a favor.

02:18:05.883 --> 02:18:07.510
Is this about Rebecca?

02:18:07.584 --> 02:18:09.177
-- Rebecca? No.
-- Yes.

02:18:09.253 --> 02:18:12.018
I am rooting for you, Dan, but I really
can't get involved in things like this.

02:18:12.089 --> 02:18:13.056
It's not about Rebecca.

02:18:13.123 --> 02:18:14.215
Bad things happen to people

02:18:14.290 --> 02:18:15.656
when they get involved
in other people's business,

02:18:15.726 --> 02:18:16.955
a lesson I'm trying
to teach Natalie.

02:18:17.027 --> 02:18:18.084
I'd like to set
a good example.

02:18:18.161 --> 02:18:20.528
It's not...about...Rebecca.

02:18:20.597 --> 02:18:22.429
-- What's the favor?
-- It's about Rebecca.

02:18:22.499 --> 02:18:23.989
-- Yes! -- Let me tell you
what I'd like you to do.

02:18:24.066 --> 02:18:26.058
I'd like you to go up
to her office on some excuse,

02:18:26.136 --> 02:18:27.728
and then say
some nice things about me.

02:18:27.804 --> 02:18:29.737
Let me tell you
why I'm not gonna do that.

02:18:29.806 --> 02:18:32.036
-- I'll look like a jackass.
-- No, you would look sweet.

02:18:32.109 --> 02:18:33.701
-- I don't think so.
-- Women love this.

02:18:33.777 --> 02:18:35.609
-- Stalking? Not as much
as you may think. -- Yeah.

02:18:35.679 --> 02:18:37.169
Jeremy...

02:18:37.246 --> 02:18:39.079
-- you and I need a bond.
-- We have a bond.

02:18:39.148 --> 02:18:40.708
-- It could be stronger.
-- It's pretty strong.

02:18:40.784 --> 02:18:42.683
-- Look at me and Casey.
-- Was he willing to do it?

02:18:42.753 --> 02:18:43.914
<i>Casey: No!
-- Hey:!</i>

02:18:43.986 --> 02:18:44.920
I've got work.

02:18:46.189 --> 02:18:48.920
Is there nothing
I wouldn't do for you?

02:18:48.992 --> 02:18:50.619
[Telephones ringing]

02:18:50.693 --> 02:18:52.684
[indistinct conversations]

02:18:52.763 --> 02:18:54.788
All the help I gave you
with Natalie.

02:18:56.700 --> 02:18:58.794
Is there nothing
I wouldn't do for you?

02:18:59.870 --> 02:19:02.566
And this is how
I'm to be repaid?

02:19:04.341 --> 02:19:05.433
I see you're about to cave.

02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:08.410
No, I just can't believe how much you
sounded like my mother just then.

02:19:08.477 --> 02:19:11.379
-- You'll do it? -- What possible excuse
can I give for stopping by her office?

02:19:11.448 --> 02:19:13.075
-- You'll think of something.
-- I won't think of something.

02:19:13.150 --> 02:19:14.447
-- You will.
-- I won't.

02:19:14.518 --> 02:19:16.384
-- You're good on your feet.
-- I'm not good on my feet.

02:19:16.452 --> 02:19:17.852
-- You really are.
-- I'm really not.

02:19:17.955 --> 02:19:21.219
You just need to mention some impressive
things about me. I've prepared a shortlist.

02:19:21.258 --> 02:19:23.886
-- There isn't any other way we
can strengthen our bond? -- No.

02:19:25.995 --> 02:19:27.326
Give me the list.

02:19:28.598 --> 02:19:30.123
<i>This is their world, Isaac.</i>

02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:31.668
They live where it's murky.

02:19:31.735 --> 02:19:35.330
Poisonous, tentacle-bearing,
prehistoric sea creatures.

02:19:35.405 --> 02:19:36.895
You're afraid of fish?

02:19:36.974 --> 02:19:38.339
And I'm not ashamed
to admit it.

02:19:38.407 --> 02:19:40.467
There aren't gonna be
any sharks down there.

02:19:40.544 --> 02:19:42.205
We don't know
what the hell's down there.

02:19:42.279 --> 02:19:44.475
It's down there.
It's their home court.

02:19:44.548 --> 02:19:45.947
They know what they're doing
down there.

02:19:46.016 --> 02:19:47.814
<i>They can breathe down “were.</i>

02:19:47.884 --> 02:19:49.875
I need this ridiculous
rubber tube

02:19:49.953 --> 02:19:51.182
and a pair of goggles.

02:19:51.254 --> 02:19:53.120
Are you afraid they're gonna
make fun of you?

02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:54.521
-- Isaac --
-- No, really, <i>I</i> mean,

02:19:54.591 --> 02:19:56.457
are you afraid the fish are
gonna look at you,

02:19:56.526 --> 02:19:59.621
and point, and say, "Look
at that thing with the lungs"?

02:19:59.696 --> 02:20:02.961
No, I'm not afraid the fish
are gonna make fun of me.

02:20:03.033 --> 02:20:04.296
You eat fish, don't you?

02:20:04.368 --> 02:20:06.132
And don't you think
they know that?

02:20:06.203 --> 02:20:07.136
[Chuckles]

02:20:07.204 --> 02:20:09.434
I don't think snorkeling's
for you.

02:20:09.506 --> 02:20:10.996
This is what I'm saying.

02:20:11.074 --> 02:20:12.303
-- Dana.
-- Yes.

02:20:12.376 --> 02:20:14.310
Is everything all right?

02:20:14.378 --> 02:20:15.436
Yeah.

02:20:16.546 --> 02:20:19.277
No, I meant
with you and Gordon.

02:20:19.383 --> 02:20:21.715
Is everything all right?

02:20:21.752 --> 02:20:23.345
Yeah, I'm just --

02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:25.411
I'm 33.

02:20:27.224 --> 02:20:28.658
Tsk.

02:20:28.725 --> 02:20:30.955
And I'm very much afraid
of fish.

02:20:32.029 --> 02:20:33.394
Okay.

02:20:41.538 --> 02:20:44.508
<i>Rebecca: If Diane's office doesn't have
it, then you should talk to Sloane.</i>

02:20:44.574 --> 02:20:47.566
<i>If Sloane doesn't have it, then
we're working late tonight.</i>

02:20:47.644 --> 02:20:49.203
-- Excuse me.
-- Hi.

02:20:49.279 --> 02:20:50.769
-- Rebecca?
-- Yes.

02:20:50.847 --> 02:20:52.440
Rebecca Wells?

02:20:52.516 --> 02:20:54.245
-- Yes. Hi.
-- Hi.

02:20:54.317 --> 02:20:56.411
Oh, I can wait
till you're off the phone.

02:20:56.486 --> 02:20:57.453
What's this about?

02:20:57.521 --> 02:21:00.354
That's a perfectly fair
question.

02:21:00.424 --> 02:21:03.223
Doug, I'm gonna
call you back, okay?

02:21:03.293 --> 02:21:04.226
Hey -- I --

02:21:04.294 --> 02:21:05.591
It could have waited.

02:21:05.662 --> 02:21:06.925
What could have waited?

02:21:06.997 --> 02:21:09.625
Well, I'm here to
welcome you, actually.

02:21:09.699 --> 02:21:11.827
You're new here,
and I came to say "welcome."

02:21:11.902 --> 02:21:13.199
Welcome to the building.

02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:14.795
I've been working here
for three years.

02:21:14.871 --> 02:21:16.635
Yes, I misspoke.

02:21:16.706 --> 02:21:18.299
I'm new here.

02:21:18.375 --> 02:21:19.865
And you came by
to say welcome?

02:21:19.943 --> 02:21:21.411
-- Yes. No.
-- Really?

02:21:21.478 --> 02:21:23.207
-- What's your name?
-- Jeremy Goodwin.

02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:25.248
Jeremy, why don't you give it
another try?

02:21:25.315 --> 02:21:27.283
-- All right, I will. Yes.
-- You're from "Sports Night."

02:21:27.350 --> 02:21:28.579
-- Dan sent you?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

02:21:28.652 --> 02:21:30.245
-- To say nice things about him.
-- <i>I have</i> a <i>list.</i>

02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:32.288
ls everyone who works
on your show deranged?

02:21:32.355 --> 02:21:34.119
I swear, everyone but me.

02:21:34.191 --> 02:21:36.888
You needed a better plan,
Jeremy.

02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:38.325
Yes, I know.

02:21:38.395 --> 02:21:40.796
-- You came down here with nothin'.
-- Hey, not with nothing.

02:21:40.864 --> 02:21:43.629
"Welcome to the building"?
Hmm.

02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:47.659
Won't you please...
go outwith Dan?

02:21:47.737 --> 02:21:49.728
[Sighing ] Well, God. Maybe.

02:21:49.806 --> 02:21:53.071
Cause at cheerleader tryouts, Kiki did say
Dan was talking about me in the cafeteria.

02:21:53.143 --> 02:21:55.134
-- Rebecca -- -- Dan's a very
good-looking man, he's charming,

02:21:55.212 --> 02:21:56.338
he's a television star.

02:21:56.413 --> 02:21:58.108
I would think he could have
any woman he wants.

02:21:58.181 --> 02:21:59.842
-- He wants you.
-- He wants me today.

02:21:59.916 --> 02:22:02.146
-- Well, for the last week.
-- Yes.

02:22:02.219 --> 02:22:03.345
What were we talking about?

02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:04.478
[Sighs]

02:22:04.554 --> 02:22:07.421
I've had experience
with sportscasters.

02:22:07.491 --> 02:22:09.482
-- What kind of experience?
-- I was married to one.

02:22:09.559 --> 02:22:10.788
-- Ahh. Which one?
-- Yes.

02:22:10.861 --> 02:22:12.192
-- None of your business.
-- That's right.

02:22:12.262 --> 02:22:14.287
They are self-absorbed,
narrow-minded, immature people

02:22:14.364 --> 02:22:16.765
of limited intelligence
and limitless ego.

02:22:16.833 --> 02:22:18.426
It's none of my business,

02:22:18.535 --> 02:22:20.264
but if that's the kind of thing
you told your husband --

02:22:20.303 --> 02:22:22.635
-- We're through here now.
Take care. -- Right.

02:22:25.208 --> 02:22:26.334
Hey, look --

02:22:26.409 --> 02:22:28.935
<i>go outwith him
or don't go outwith him,</i>

02:22:29.012 --> 02:22:32.846
but for the record, nothing
you just said describes Dan.

02:22:32.916 --> 02:22:34.941
Thank you.

02:22:36.019 --> 02:22:38.078
Welcome to the building.

02:22:44.227 --> 02:22:47.128
<i>Dana: After 15:23, we'll throw
it to a two shot on the break.</i>

02:22:47.197 --> 02:22:49.689
-- <i>That's</i> a bonus break. -- <i>Yeah,
but it's scripted in the 20s.</i>

02:22:49.766 --> 02:22:52.463
-- You need to erase that. -- I scratched
it out. -- <i>AH</i> right, Tampa Bay --

02:22:52.536 --> 02:22:54.868
-- If you used a pencil, you could
erase that. -- I like to use a pen.

02:22:54.938 --> 02:22:55.666
<i>Tampa Ba'! '-</i>

02:22:55.739 --> 02:22:56.672
You should use a pencil.

02:22:56.740 --> 02:22:59.300
<i>Would it be possible...
to have one 10:00 meeting</i>

02:22:59.376 --> 02:23:01.367
that doesn't degenerate
into dork recess?

02:23:01.444 --> 02:23:03.469
The noon meeting,
the 6:00, the 8:00 --

02:23:03.547 --> 02:23:05.982
these are fine,
and then the 10:00 rolls around,

02:23:06.049 --> 02:23:07.483
and you all start to unravel.

02:23:07.551 --> 02:23:09.315
Just once I'd like that
not to happen!

02:23:13.890 --> 02:23:15.483
All right.
Casey's got 3:10 --

02:23:15.559 --> 02:23:17.254
I have to go snorkeling.

02:23:17.327 --> 02:23:19.386
-- Dana.
-- <i>No, I have to, Natalie.</i>

02:23:19.462 --> 02:23:21.396
I-| know. I'm saying
maybe now's not the time --

02:23:21.464 --> 02:23:23.091
Gordon thinks
I'm too invested in the show.

02:23:23.166 --> 02:23:24.827
-- [Telephone ringing]
-- I'm losing him, and I believe

02:23:24.901 --> 02:23:27.370
I can heal our relationship
if I go snorkeling.

02:23:27.437 --> 02:23:30.168
The guys I'm with -- it's usually
good enough just to wear the outfit.

02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:33.733
-- Conference room. -- <i>I</i> will
overcome my fear of fish.

02:23:33.810 --> 02:23:35.278
Gordon's on your line.

02:23:35.345 --> 02:23:36.540
You see what good thinking
can do?

02:23:36.613 --> 02:23:39.344
-- Do you want us to step outside?
-- He's just calling to say hi.

02:23:39.416 --> 02:23:40.440
What's happening?

02:23:41.918 --> 02:23:43.386
We were just talking
about that.

02:23:43.453 --> 02:23:45.012
I'm gonna overcome
my fear of fish.

02:23:47.958 --> 02:23:49.050

Let's meet back
in 20 minutes.

02:23:53.930 --> 02:23:58.299
No, no, that's...fine.

02:24:01.137 --> 02:24:04.072
This way, I can take the time
I was going to devote

02:24:04.140 --> 02:24:07.303
to getting over
my fear of fish to...

02:24:07.377 --> 02:24:11.780
get over my fear
of something else...like...

comfortable with.

02:24:20.290 --> 02:24:21.655

-- Hey, Natalie.

-- How you doin'?
-- What did I do?

02:24:32.168 --> 02:24:35.331
Why aren't you pursuing Dana
the way I told you to?

02:24:35.405 --> 02:24:37.897
Hey, Dana made it very clear
in no uncertain terms

02:24:37.974 --> 02:24:40.033
that she wanted me
to <i>stop</i> pursuing her,

02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:43.808
and that was back when I never was
pursuing her, which I'm still not now.

02:24:43.880 --> 02:24:46.679
She's in there right now listening to
Gordon bail on the snorkeling trip,

02:24:46.750 --> 02:24:48.240
and she was very excited
about it.

02:24:48.318 --> 02:24:50.013
She was gonna get over
her fear of fish.

02:24:50.086 --> 02:24:52.748
Fish is not
what Dana's afraid of.

02:24:52.822 --> 02:24:54.916
-- What's she afraid of? -- Holding
out for what she deserves.

02:24:54.991 --> 02:24:56.322
Exactly! Exactly.

02:24:56.393 --> 02:24:58.452
I totally agree, and I don't
even know what that means.

02:24:58.528 --> 02:25:00.622
Do you think Dana's happy
going outwith Gordon?

02:25:00.697 --> 02:25:02.165
-- I do not.
-- We're in agreement.

02:25:02.232 --> 02:25:04.428
I think Dana would be happy
going out with you.

02:25:04.501 --> 02:25:05.696
And there we do not agree.

02:25:05.769 --> 02:25:07.294
Listen to what
I'm telling you!

02:25:07.370 --> 02:25:08.531
I have, and you're wrong.

02:25:08.605 --> 02:25:10.505
We're best friends.
She tells me things.

02:25:10.573 --> 02:25:12.439
-- What has she told you?
-- Things.

02:25:12.509 --> 02:25:15.809
-- She told you she'd rather be going out with
me than with Gordon? -- Not in those words.

02:25:15.879 --> 02:25:17.347
-- In what words?
-- Other words.

02:25:17.414 --> 02:25:19.576
-- Natalie -- -- Gordon's
about to break up with Dana.

02:25:19.649 --> 02:25:21.208
He might even be doing it
right now.

02:25:21.284 --> 02:25:22.615
And the only reason
Dana cares

02:25:22.686 --> 02:25:24.484
is that she thinks
she's supposed to care.

02:25:24.554 --> 02:25:26.454
-- She thinks this is her fault.
<i>Isaac:</i> Casey.

02:25:26.523 --> 02:25:27.718
Isaac, don't you think --

02:25:27.791 --> 02:25:29.759
don't you know that Dana
isn't happy with Gordon,

02:25:29.826 --> 02:25:33.319
and that Gordon is about to break up with
Dana, and Dana only <i>thinks</i> she cares?

02:25:33.396 --> 02:25:34.693
You know what?

02:25:34.764 --> 02:25:37.131
I'm gonna step out now, and
it'll be like I never came in.

02:25:39.502 --> 02:25:41.994
Casey...

02:25:42.072 --> 02:25:43.130
no kidding around.

02:25:43.206 --> 02:25:45.766
The world keeps moving
in one direction.

02:25:45.842 --> 02:25:48.004
Do something.

02:25:48.078 --> 02:25:49.307
Really.

02:25:49.379 --> 02:25:51.871
If I did something, Natalie,
it would just be as a friend.

02:25:51.948 --> 02:25:53.074
Whatever.

02:25:53.149 --> 02:25:54.674
What should I do?

02:25:54.751 --> 02:25:55.741
You should go to her.

02:25:57.487 --> 02:25:58.648
Go to her?

02:25:58.722 --> 02:25:59.689
You should go to her.

02:25:59.756 --> 02:26:01.918
-- When?
-- Now.

02:26:01.991 --> 02:26:04.221
-- I should go to her now.
-- Yes.

02:26:04.294 --> 02:26:05.227
On a Thursday.

02:26:05.295 --> 02:26:06.285
Yes.

02:26:07.697 --> 02:26:08.596
Go to her.

02:26:08.665 --> 02:26:09.757
Right.

02:26:09.833 --> 02:26:12.029
What should I do
once I get to her?

02:26:12.102 --> 02:26:14.332
Be a man.

02:26:16.106 --> 02:26:17.574
Right.

02:26:19.576 --> 02:26:20.634
[Chuckles]

02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:22.075
I've got that wired, right?

02:26:22.145 --> 02:26:23.772
Yeah.

02:26:23.847 --> 02:26:26.248
[Sighs]

02:26:26.316 --> 02:26:29.217
[indistinct voices]

02:26:29.285 --> 02:26:32.778
[Telephones ringing]

02:26:32.856 --> 02:26:34.085
Hey, Dana.

02:26:34.157 --> 02:26:36.023
Hey, I'm gonna move
San Jose into the 4 block.

02:26:36.092 --> 02:26:37.184
That's fine.

02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:39.024
And you wrote a killer intro
for the 40s.

02:26:39.095 --> 02:26:40.494
Thank you.

02:26:40.563 --> 02:26:41.655
-- Uh...
-- What?

02:26:41.731 --> 02:26:43.392
Is -- ls everything
all right with Gordon?

02:26:43.466 --> 02:26:44.262
Yeah.

02:26:44.334 --> 02:26:46.200
'Cause I heard maybe he
called off the snorkeling.

02:26:46.269 --> 02:26:48.135
He did.
We're going skiing instead.

02:26:48.204 --> 02:26:50.036
-- Oh. -- The same place he
took me that first time.

02:26:50.106 --> 02:26:51.039
-- Sugarbush.
-- Sugarbush.

02:26:51.107 --> 02:26:52.199
[Chuckles] Remember.

02:26:52.275 --> 02:26:53.572
See, so everything works out.

02:26:53.643 --> 02:26:54.633
-- It does.
-- Hmm.

02:26:54.711 --> 02:26:56.475
-- Is there anything else?
-- Nope.

02:26:56.546 --> 02:26:59.277
Seriously, the intro you wrote
for the 40s is really funny.

02:26:59.349 --> 02:27:01.613
You are cracking me up today.

02:27:01.684 --> 02:27:03.015
Excellent.

02:27:04.053 --> 02:27:06.545
This 1 3/8 gets amortized
over 4 quarters.

02:27:06.623 --> 02:27:08.557
It has to be right
on all of the documents

02:27:08.625 --> 02:27:10.684
before they get sent over
to Shearson.

02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:11.921
Got it.

02:27:11.995 --> 02:27:13.326
-- How you doin'?
-- Dan.

02:27:13.396 --> 02:27:15.194
-- I <i>knew</i> I knew you.
-- Yes.

02:27:15.265 --> 02:27:17.131
-- You're Steve Siscds wife.
-- Ex-wife.

02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.168
-- We were introduced once.
-- Yes.

02:27:19.235 --> 02:27:21.033
Why have you been pretending
you didn't remember?

02:27:21.104 --> 02:27:23.596
Look who's talking. You didn't remember
me, and you weren't pretending.

02:27:23.673 --> 02:27:25.266
Yeah, but then we met
in the elevator,

02:27:25.341 --> 02:27:26.900
and you pretended you didn't
remember me after that...

02:27:26.976 --> 02:27:29.138
until you did remember me later, but then
you didn't want to go out with me anyway.

02:27:29.212 --> 02:27:31.579
-- That's right. -- Because
sportscasters are self-absorbed,

02:27:31.648 --> 02:27:35.175
narrow-minded people of limited
intelligence and limitless ego.

02:27:35.251 --> 02:27:36.980
That's right.

02:27:37.053 --> 02:27:39.488
Let me tell you something --
first of all,

02:27:39.556 --> 02:27:42.457
I'm a sports anchor,
not a sportscaster.

02:27:42.525 --> 02:27:43.959
Second of all,
you married a jerk.

02:27:44.027 --> 02:27:46.018
I know about Steve Sisco.

02:27:46.095 --> 02:27:47.859
Everybody knows
about Steve Sisco.

02:27:47.931 --> 02:27:49.296
Sister, you married a loser.

02:27:49.365 --> 02:27:52.266
And the fact that you think that that
man's low-grade brand of manhood

02:27:52.335 --> 02:27:54.303
is any way indicative
of my profession

02:27:54.370 --> 02:27:56.464
is beneath your obvious
intelligence and class.

02:27:56.539 --> 02:27:59.008
What guys like that do
to women like you

02:27:59.075 --> 02:28:01.442
makes me absolutely crazy.

02:28:07.083 --> 02:28:08.778
I knew I recognized you.

02:28:09.853 --> 02:28:11.719
Will you look at this?

02:28:11.788 --> 02:28:13.222
You're working late,

02:28:13.289 --> 02:28:15.883
I have a show to do in
10 minutes just 12 stories up.

02:28:15.959 --> 02:28:19.520
There's no earthly reason why you shouldn't
be having dinner with me after the show.

02:28:19.629 --> 02:28:22.599
It would be midnight, and we'd go to a great
place, and I'd ask you about your day,

02:28:22.632 --> 02:28:24.361
'cause I genuinely do care
about your day.

02:28:24.434 --> 02:28:26.334
And I'd be funny,
and you'd have a good time.

02:28:26.402 --> 02:28:28.268
And when I took you home at,
like, 3:00 A.M.,

02:28:28.338 --> 02:28:29.863
and I tried to kiss you
good night,

02:28:29.939 --> 02:28:31.304
I think I'd have been
successful.

02:28:31.374 --> 02:28:33.399
In fact, I know it.

02:28:36.279 --> 02:28:38.407
And I can't believe none of
that's ever gonna happen

02:28:38.481 --> 02:28:41.143
'cause once there was a time
you married an idiot.

02:28:43.419 --> 02:28:46.480
I've got to get back to my job,
which, rest assured,

02:28:46.556 --> 02:28:49.184
I do considerably better
than Steve Sisco.

02:28:52.996 --> 02:28:55.124
[Laughing] Neighborhood park
all covered with cheese?

02:28:55.198 --> 02:28:57.326
<i>I knew it.
You've been watching the show.</i>

02:28:57.400 --> 02:28:58.231
Cheese, Danny?

02:28:58.301 --> 02:29:00.668
-- I-| was distracted.
-- How exactly did the cheese --

02:29:00.737 --> 02:29:02.762
You know what?
I've actually heard them all.

02:29:02.839 --> 02:29:04.830
[Laughs]

02:29:04.908 --> 02:29:07.275
<i>L</i> gotta g0-

02:29:07.343 --> 02:29:09.812
Were you, uh,
by any chance...

02:29:09.879 --> 02:29:11.904
thinking about me
at that moment?

02:29:11.981 --> 02:29:12.777
What moment?

02:29:12.849 --> 02:29:15.443
The moment of
the hideous cheese blunder.

02:29:15.518 --> 02:29:17.509
I wouldn't really call it
a hideous cheese blunder.

02:29:17.587 --> 02:29:19.919
-- Danny, you said, “a park all
covered with cheese“! -- I know.

02:29:19.989 --> 02:29:23.254
That's the second time
you called me Danny.

02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:25.523
Do you like it?

02:29:25.595 --> 02:29:27.393
Yeah.

02:29:27.463 --> 02:29:29.261
Was it because of me?

02:29:29.332 --> 02:29:31.300
-- Yeah.
-- The hideous cheese mistake?

02:29:31.367 --> 02:29:33.358
I was distracted.

02:29:34.370 --> 02:29:35.804
Listen, I have to work late.

02:29:35.872 --> 02:29:39.206
If you're not doing anything, do you
want to get some dinner after your show?

02:29:39.275 --> 02:29:41.073
-- Tonight?
-- Yeah.

02:29:41.144 --> 02:29:42.043
I got a date tonight.

02:29:42.111 --> 02:29:43.579
[Sighs]

02:29:43.646 --> 02:29:44.738
That was a joke.

02:29:44.814 --> 02:29:47.146
That was a little joke I wrapped up
and gave to you free for nothing.

02:29:47.216 --> 02:29:48.274
[Sighs]
lam serious, Danny.

02:29:48.351 --> 02:29:50.376
If you turn out to be
a jackass, I am gonna --

02:29:50.453 --> 02:29:51.716
No kidding,
as God is my witness --

02:29:51.788 --> 02:29:53.882
lam gonna do something
bad to you with numbers.

02:29:53.957 --> 02:29:55.721
I stand warned.

02:29:57.527 --> 02:29:59.996
Do you swear the hideous cheese
mistake was because of me?

02:30:00.063 --> 02:30:00.996
Yes.

02:30:02.832 --> 02:30:05.426
That's really nice.
Thank you.

02:30:06.502 --> 02:30:08.470
-- I'll see you later.
-- See ya.

02:30:16.746 --> 02:30:19.613
I don't have sound on Philly, and I'm
still looking for a cold graphic.

02:30:19.716 --> 02:30:20.683
Preview 2.

02:30:20.717 --> 02:30:22.082
-- I don't have Philly.
-- Nobody has Philly.

02:30:22.151 --> 02:30:23.084
Casey?

02:30:23.152 --> 02:30:24.176
Yeah.

02:30:24.253 --> 02:30:25.516
-- The feed from San Antonio --
-- Yeah?

02:30:25.588 --> 02:30:27.420
Don't be freaked out
if it's in Spanish.

02:30:27.490 --> 02:30:29.083
Okay.

02:30:29.158 --> 02:30:30.683
-- Natalie. Where's Dan?
-- Yeah.

02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:31.727
Where's Dan?

02:30:31.794 --> 02:30:33.159
I don't have Philly,
and I don't have Dan.

02:30:33.229 --> 02:30:36.028
Dan, despite my best efforts, is
getting his heart broken by Rebecca,

02:30:36.099 --> 02:30:38.090
who gave me quite
a tongue-lashing, by the way.

02:30:38.167 --> 02:30:39.999

Uh, it's not "plenty of hay."

02:30:57.253 --> 02:31:00.188
It's "plenty of sunshine
headin' my way."

02:31:00.256 --> 02:31:01.883
That makes more sense.

02:31:01.958 --> 02:31:03.619
I gather it went well.

02:31:03.693 --> 02:31:05.058
You know,
sometimes it's worth it --

02:31:05.128 --> 02:31:06.391
taking all the pies
in the face.

02:31:06.462 --> 02:31:08.055
Sometimes you come through it
feeling good.

02:31:08.131 --> 02:31:09.360
Yes.

02:31:09.432 --> 02:31:10.695
And how was your day?

02:31:10.767 --> 02:31:13.600
Sometimes you just
stand there...

02:31:18.408 --> 02:31:19.569
Good evening.
From New York City,

02:31:19.642 --> 02:31:21.804
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.

02:31:21.878 --> 02:31:24.745
Those stories, plus
we'll take you to Indian Wells

02:31:24.814 --> 02:31:27.181
for a hard-core preview
with Marcello Rios.

02:31:27.250 --> 02:31:29.082
We'll take you out
to Auburn Hills,

02:31:29.152 --> 02:31:31.177
where the Pistons tipped off
against a Shaq attack

02:31:31.254 --> 02:31:32.653
minus the Shaq.
