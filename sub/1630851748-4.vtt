You scared him off with your
masterful hammock bird of prey mimicry.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.500
My what? All I did was panic.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.041
Sometimes, that's all you need.

02:24.125 --> 02:27.375
Sometimes, sheer panic
is the best escape plan.

Jesus, Dietrich,
that's the sixth pencil today.

02:47.708 --> 02:50.083
I don't like using pencils
that are too strong.

02:50.166 --> 02:52.000
Just in case my fingers get trapped.

02:52.083 --> 02:53.291
Trapped in what?

02:53.375 --> 02:55.833
Exactly! You just never know.

02:55.916 --> 02:57.958
Just be quiet.
You're scaring the pangolin.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.541
Your furious field note-taking
is admirable, Dietrich,

03:03.625 --> 03:05.166
but we need complete silence

03:05.250 --> 03:07.375
if we're going to record
a pangolin mating.

03:07.458 --> 03:10.375
I'm not taking notes.
I'm adding an entry into my fear journal.

03:10.458 --> 03:14.666
Every time I find something I'm scared of,
I write it down so I remember to avoid it.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.541
-See?
-Let me see that.

03:16.625 --> 03:19.083
Game shows, clown wigs, crocs.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.875
You're scared of belly button lint?

03:20.958 --> 03:23.458
It's a fire hazard inside your clothes.

03:23.541 --> 03:25.583
Come on, Dietrich. Pangolins are harmless.

03:25.666 --> 03:28.375
Harmless? Look at the way they walk
with their little arms.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.583

with a terrible secret.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.458

Just wow.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.833
The pangolin rolls up in its ball

-What the hell is going on?
-We're panicking, Bonnie.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.791
Panic is fear-induced defensive behavior

06:04.875 --> 06:07.416
that can confuse predators
and allow us to escape.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.166
Prey animals
use fear to survive all the time.

When the fulmar fears for its life,
it projectile vomits to defend itself.

06:14.791 --> 06:18.541
The oily vomit even has a special property
that ruins flight feathers.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.416
I'm basically a father to them.

09:46.500 --> 09:50.083
[BTG] <i>But on that day,</i>
<i>something unthinkable happened.</i>

09:50.166 --> 09:53.291
Maybe one day,
I'll have baboon buddies just like you.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.208
[laughing] Of course you will, Bradley.

09:55.291 --> 09:58.083
Hey, you wanna feed Susan
a piece of fruit?

09:58.750 --> 09:59.958
Here you go, Susan.

10:00.875 --> 10:03.041
Do you want some fruit too, little fella?

10:03.541 --> 10:06.583
Oh no! Don't give him any fruit!
He's not ready for--

10:06.666 --> 10:07.625
[gasps]

10:07.708 --> 10:09.541
[ominous music playing]

10:10.666 --> 10:11.833
[shrieking]

10:11.916 --> 10:13.666
Bradley, get out of here! Lock the gate!

10:13.750 --> 10:16.000
-I'm sorry, Barry the Baboon Man!
-[Barry] Go!

10:16.083 --> 10:18.416
-[panting]
-[baboons shrieking]

10:18.500 --> 10:21.250
-[Barry screaming]
-[whimpering]

10:24.000 --> 10:27.166
[Barry gagging, gurgling]

10:28.000 --> 10:30.125
I never looked at baboons
the same way again.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.125
So, they killed him?

10:31.208 --> 10:33.583
No, that's the thing.
They didn't kill him.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.250
They just ripped off his hands and face,

10:36.333 --> 10:39.333
and just let him lay there in agony.

10:39.416 --> 10:42.666
If I close my eyes,
I can still hear Barry screaming.

10:42.750 --> 10:45.916
[Barry] <i>Not the pinky finger! No!</i>

10:46.000 --> 10:48.583
Oh, I was inconsolable for months.

10:48.666 --> 10:51.041
But then my mom gave me this.

10:51.125 --> 10:52.375
Oh, so unexpected.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.458
My mother told me
to keep this on me at all times,

10:54.541 --> 10:56.458
and no baboons would ever hurt me.

10:56.541 --> 11:00.458
I know it's just a toy, but, well,
I've kept it with me ever since.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.291
[screeching]

11:03.375 --> 11:06.916
We're gonna be okay.
We've got eyes on the baboon troop.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.625
[shrieking]

11:08.708 --> 11:11.291
What's going on out there?
Why are they so worked up?

11:12.625 --> 11:14.583
-[snarling]
-[BTG] It's a leopard,

11:14.666 --> 11:16.500
the baboon's mortal enemy.

11:17.208 --> 11:18.208
[growls]

11:19.041 --> 11:20.166
[snarling]

11:21.416 --> 11:23.583
[Bonnie] Oh, what is that?

11:23.666 --> 11:24.750
Is that urine?

11:24.833 --> 11:27.416
Ew. You don't need to see this,
Mr. Stuffington.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.791
Baboons are cowards.

11:28.875 --> 11:31.708
They could fight the leopard,
but to avoid getting hurt,

11:31.791 --> 11:34.833
they'll just climb trees
and urinate in its face.

11:34.916 --> 11:37.625
I know people
who'd pay good money for that experience.

11:37.708 --> 11:39.041
Ugh!

11:39.958 --> 11:41.083
[crickets chirping]

11:45.000 --> 11:46.625
We're sitting ducks over here.

11:46.708 --> 11:48.666
Ahh! No! An earth mouth!

11:48.750 --> 11:50.458
That's a good size burrow.

11:50.541 --> 11:52.291
We might be near a meerkat den.

11:52.958 --> 11:53.791
There.

11:56.166 --> 11:58.541
Meerkats are the best ground lookouts
in the savanna.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.041
Nothing gets past them.

12:00.125 --> 12:03.958
If we can ingratiate ourselves,
we might make it through the night.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.458
[meerkats squeaking]

12:09.625 --> 12:10.750
What's this now?

12:12.041 --> 12:13.416
[squeaking]

12:13.500 --> 12:15.375
You want me to be a lookout?

12:15.458 --> 12:18.166
But I'm farsighted and nearsighted.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.833
[screeching]

12:19.916 --> 12:21.625
Ow! Okay. Okay.

12:21.708 --> 12:22.708
Yes, sir.

12:25.125 --> 12:27.208
-Quick, come with us.
-I'm not going AWOL.

12:27.291 --> 12:29.458
That's okay, we can make camp here.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.166
Giraffe. Perfect.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.208
Lots of scared animals hang around giraffe
because they're so tall

12:34.291 --> 12:36.375
they can provide early warning
of predators.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.583
Look at us cowards all sticking together.

12:38.666 --> 12:39.625
So sweet.

12:39.708 --> 12:41.958
It's the only way to survive out here.

12:43.166 --> 12:46.541
-Hey, Uncle B, can I ask you something?
-Of course.

12:47.166 --> 12:48.375
Do you think about dying?

12:48.458 --> 12:49.458
No, not really.

12:49.541 --> 12:51.666
I came to terms with death
a long time ago.

12:51.750 --> 12:54.041
-Back when you were a soldier?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

12:54.125 --> 12:55.875
What do you think happens when we die?

12:55.958 --> 12:59.041
Beyond the biological breakdown,
I honestly don't know,

12:59.125 --> 13:00.958
and I'm okay with not knowing.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.875
I think the Greek philosopher Epicurus
said it best,

13:03.958 --> 13:05.500
"Death is nothing to fear

13:05.583 --> 13:08.916
because you and death
cannot exist at the same time."

13:09.000 --> 13:11.375
-[Dietrich yelping]
-[meerkats screeching]

13:11.458 --> 13:14.000
Hmm. The giraffes are gone.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.583
Then we're in real trouble.

13:15.666 --> 13:16.916
[Dietrich] Quick, get in!

13:20.666 --> 13:21.583
What the…

13:21.666 --> 13:23.500
I built a fort for protection.

13:25.125 --> 13:28.166
Wow. Fear really is your superpower,
Dietrich.

13:30.625 --> 13:32.791
[BTG] Dietrich, this is incredible.

13:32.875 --> 13:36.791
It's like a beaver dam, eagle's nest,
and termite cathedral all mixed into one.

13:36.875 --> 13:39.791
Remember that termite cathedral
we saw in Queensland, Australia?

13:39.875 --> 13:40.958
So massive.

13:42.375 --> 13:43.791
So massive!

13:44.416 --> 13:46.291
[rumbling]

13:47.541 --> 13:48.916
[screeching]

13:49.583 --> 13:51.333
[screams] We're gonna die!

13:51.875 --> 13:53.833
-To the escape hatch!
-Where does it let out?

13:53.916 --> 13:56.125
-Right where the baboons are.
-That's not ideal.

13:56.208 --> 13:58.708
-[rumbling]
-[shrieking]

13:58.791 --> 14:00.708
Well, I'm not going out like a coward!

14:01.208 --> 14:03.833
For Barry! [yelling]

14:03.916 --> 14:06.458
-[baboons screeching]
-[grunting]

14:07.041 --> 14:08.458
-[screams]
-Bonnie!

14:08.541 --> 14:09.583
[screaming]

14:09.666 --> 14:11.916
Looks like your worst fear
has finally come true.

14:12.666 --> 14:14.125
My worst fear.

14:14.625 --> 14:17.125
No, no, no, no, no! Bonnie! [echoing]

14:18.041 --> 14:19.958
[gasps] Bonnie.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.833
[grunts] For Barry the Baboon Man!

14:23.916 --> 14:25.750
-[panting]
-[screaming]

14:25.833 --> 14:27.125
[roaring]

[baboons screeching]

14:28.958 --> 14:30.458
[grunting]

14:33.250 --> 14:34.541
We can't fight them all.

14:34.625 --> 14:37.708
If you wanna survive,
we have to be cowards.

14:37.791 --> 14:39.958
[baboons screeching]

14:42.291 --> 14:44.000
[roaring]

14:44.083 --> 14:45.791

[shrieking]

14:49.208 --> 14:50.250
[sighs]

14:52.291 --> 14:53.625
[roaring]

14:55.458 --> 14:56.791
Goodbye, old friend.

-[shrieking]

15:14.666 --> 15:15.666
Come on!

15:20.625 --> 15:22.500
[exhales] It's a bust.

15:22.583 --> 15:26.041
The focus is blurry, the angles are poor,
I can't see what's going on.

15:26.125 --> 15:28.250
Yep, sounds like a sex tape.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.791
This might be
our least successful expedition yet.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.958
Uncle B, what are you talking about?

15:33.041 --> 15:36.000
You faced your biggest fear.
That's not nothing.

15:36.083 --> 15:39.666
Yeah, well, I guess I've grown up a lot
since Barry was mutilated.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.083
I wonder if he's still alive.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.250
My guess is…

15:42.791 --> 15:44.000
no.

15:44.750 --> 15:45.750
Definitely not.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.958
Dietrich, I found your fear journal.

15:49.458 --> 15:50.458
Dietrich?

15:51.458 --> 15:53.458
[baboons chattering]

15:56.666 --> 15:59.250
I got you.
You're safe now, Mr. Stuffington.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.125
<i>Well, except for your body.</i>

16:05.583 --> 16:07.333
