00:23.208 --> 00:27.375
A long, long time ago,
a kingdom lived in peace…

00:32.708 --> 00:34.833
believing they had nothing to fear.

00:38.542 --> 00:40.250
But lurking in the shadows

00:41.417 --> 00:44.042
was a great and terrible evil.

00:46.417 --> 00:49.042
The monster attacked without warning,

00:49.125 --> 00:52.833
laying waste to everything
and everyone in its path.

00:54.250 --> 00:57.833
But in that darkest hour, a hero rose up.

00:57.917 --> 01:00.583
Her name was Gloreth.

01:00.667 --> 01:03.708
Go back to the shadows
from whence you came!

01:13.667 --> 01:17.333
Gloreth vowed that her people
would never be vulnerable again.

01:19.250 --> 01:23.917
So she trained an elite force of knights
and decreed that their descendants

01:24.000 --> 01:26.917
would protect the kingdom
for generations to come.

01:28.875 --> 01:31.083
But if you want a happily ever after,

01:32.458 --> 01:34.500
you can never let your guard down

01:35.667 --> 01:39.417
because the monsters are always out there.

01:44.625 --> 01:46.458
Good evening, folks.

01:46.542 --> 01:48.875
We are coming to you live
from the Glorodome.

01:48.958 --> 01:51.208
-I'm Nate Knight.
-I'm Alamzapam Davis.

01:51.292 --> 01:54.333
And tonight's the night
we knight the knights!

01:54.417 --> 01:56.417
-Ain't that right, Pam?
-It sure is, Nate.

01:56.500 --> 02:00.625
But this is also the most controversial
knighting ceremony in a thousand years.

02:00.708 --> 02:03.375
You can feel the excitement
and the tension.

02:03.458 --> 02:06.958
- Come on! It's starting!
-Tonight, tradition will be cast aside,

02:07.042 --> 02:11.417
and the kingdom will change forever
because of one man.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.333
Ballister.

02:12.417 --> 02:15.708
The street kid with the impossible dream
of being a knight.

02:15.792 --> 02:19.167
I'm here to slay monsters
and protect our kingdom!

02:20.042 --> 02:21.292
Impossible, that is,

02:21.375 --> 02:24.875
until the queen herself made
a shocking decision.

02:24.958 --> 02:25.792
Whoa…

02:25.875 --> 02:28.708
No, he doesn't come
from a noble bloodline…

02:29.708 --> 02:33.417
…but he might just have
the heart of a hero.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.792
And Ballister made
the most of that chance,

02:36.875 --> 02:38.875
graduating top of his institute class.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.167
A class that includes none other than…

02:41.250 --> 02:43.667
-Ambrosius Goldenloin.
-Hey.

02:43.750 --> 02:46.458
Direct descendant of Gloreth herself,

02:46.542 --> 02:49.792
and the most anticipated knight
of a generation.

02:49.875 --> 02:51.875
-Whoo!
- Whoo!

02:52.750 --> 02:55.417
With Ballister joining
the ranks, for the first time in history,

02:55.500 --> 02:58.875
our safety will be put
in the hands of a commoner.

02:58.958 --> 03:00.125
I don't feel safe.

03:00.208 --> 03:01.958
It's not what Gloreth wanted.

03:02.042 --> 03:04.708
Ugh. I really hope
the queen knows what she's doing.

03:04.792 --> 03:08.042
So tonight, only one question remains.

03:08.625 --> 03:13.042
Will the kingdom accept this knight
who might not be right?

03:21.917 --> 03:26.292
Will the kingdom accept this knight
who might not be right?

03:26.375 --> 03:27.208
All right.

03:27.292 --> 03:31.542
Aaand will Ballister be broody
on the biggest day of his life?

03:31.625 --> 03:36.125
I'm not brooding. I'm just-- I'm thinking.
This is my thinking face.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.458
Hey, Thinky Face. Look at me.

03:41.458 --> 03:46.167
You were better
and worked harder than all of us.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.250
You're gonna be a knight, Bal.

03:48.333 --> 03:51.042
Okay, okay, okay.

03:55.417 --> 03:57.250
But what if they still hate me?

03:57.750 --> 04:00.000
No one hates a hero of the realm.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.000
They're gonna love you.

04:07.208 --> 04:08.083
Like I do.

04:12.083 --> 04:13.542
My lords and ladies,

04:13.625 --> 04:17.125
the knighting ceremony
is just moments away.

04:20.667 --> 04:21.792
Your sword.

04:22.625 --> 04:25.083
Your sword, and don't touch the cart.

04:25.167 --> 04:26.458
Okay, relax.

04:26.542 --> 04:27.542
Your sword.

04:32.667 --> 04:34.333
Hey, Ballister. Listen, man.

04:34.417 --> 04:37.458
I just wanted to say,
I know I've always been tough on you,

04:37.542 --> 04:39.667
and I never thought you belonged here…

04:41.167 --> 04:42.000
And?

04:43.417 --> 04:44.708
And what?

04:44.792 --> 04:46.500
Did you think I was gonna keep going,

04:46.583 --> 04:49.917
or did you think I was gonna apologize
for how I treated you?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.083
Oh, my God! That's hilarious.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.667
You're so stupid.
I love it. It's so funny.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.042
Hey, everybody!

04:56.125 --> 05:00.125
Ballister thought I was gonna apologize
for treating him like the trash he is!

05:01.208 --> 05:03.875
Uh, your sword?

05:03.958 --> 05:05.083
Ah, thanks.

05:06.042 --> 05:07.500
Hmm. Mm…

05:07.583 --> 05:10.292
-Um, uh, Mr. Ballister?
-Hey, Squire,

05:10.375 --> 05:13.583
come take a picture with the real knight,
not some charity case.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.708
-High five!

05:15.792 --> 05:17.667
-Smack that hard. Slap it!
-Can I just--

05:17.750 --> 05:19.167
- Cadets.
-Uh…

05:21.000 --> 05:24.125
There is no greater calling
than protecting this kingdom from evil.

05:25.583 --> 05:27.292
Never let your guard down,

05:27.375 --> 05:31.583
never weaken,
and always be the will of Gloreth.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.792
-Yes, Director!
-Thank you, Director.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.250
Thank you, Director.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.250
-Thank you, Director.

05:37.333 --> 05:42.292
Ballister, today the kingdom will see you
for who you really are.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.750
Thank you, Director.

05:44.417 --> 05:45.875
-Director.
-Thank you, Director.

05:45.958 --> 05:46.917
Teacher's pet.

05:48.375 --> 05:50.667
Wait, what do you mean?
You think I'm her favorite?

05:50.750 --> 05:56.083
And now the newest heroes of the realm!

06:08.208 --> 06:12.500
Goldenloin! Goldenloin! Goldenloin!

06:12.583 --> 06:16.125
My lords and ladies,
Her Majesty the Queen.

06:29.250 --> 06:31.833
Here comes the whoo. Whoo!

06:31.917 --> 06:33.708
Whoo!

06:33.792 --> 06:35.042
Huh.

06:38.375 --> 06:43.875
I hereby pronounce you
Sir Ambrosius Goldenloin,

06:43.958 --> 06:45.542
hero of the realm.

06:47.292 --> 06:49.167
Stand, Sir Knight.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.167
Here we go.

07:05.208 --> 07:07.833
I've been looking forward to this moment.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.292
Thank you, Your Majesty.

07:11.417 --> 07:15.375
My people, starting today,

07:15.458 --> 07:18.208
any of you should be able
to hold the sword

07:18.292 --> 07:19.792
-if you want it.
-Huh?

07:19.875 --> 07:21.625
If you earn it.

07:21.708 --> 07:26.208
I've watched this young man earn it
many times over.

07:27.833 --> 07:28.917
Your sword.

07:31.542 --> 07:33.708
I hereby pronounce you

07:33.792 --> 07:37.250
Sir Ballister Boldheart,

07:37.333 --> 07:39.958
hero of the realm!

07:48.167 --> 07:51.375
-Boldheart!
-Yeah!

07:51.458 --> 07:53.750
- Boldheart! Boldheart!
-Yeah!

07:53.833 --> 07:55.500
Boldheart! Boldheart!

07:55.583 --> 07:58.292
Boldheart! [laughing] Yeah!

07:58.375 --> 08:02.792
Boldheart! Boldheart! Boldheart!

08:02.875 --> 08:05.542
Congratulations, Sir Boldheart.

08:05.625 --> 08:09.333
Let a new era of heroes begin with you.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.292
Ohh!

08:21.167 --> 08:22.333
Agh.

08:48.917 --> 08:51.708
Arrest him! He killed the queen!

08:51.792 --> 08:54.292
- Let's get him!
- Yeah, he killed the queen!

08:58.833 --> 09:02.458
Some of us don't get
the happily ever after we're looking for…

09:04.458 --> 09:06.333
…'cause it ain't that kind of kingdom.

09:09.083 --> 09:12.375
And this ain't that kind of story.

09:13.375 --> 09:15.667
The queen killer
is still out there.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.542
Everyone is scared.

09:17.625 --> 09:18.667
Oh. Freak!

09:18.750 --> 09:22.500
Not since Gloreth's monster
has anything been so hated.

09:22.583 --> 09:25.708
-He never should've been a knight.
-He wasn't one of us and hated us for it.

09:25.792 --> 09:27.042
-A commoner.
-He's vile.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.500
-He's got no place in this kingdom.
-He's a murderer.

09:29.583 --> 09:30.708
He's a monster.

09:30.792 --> 09:32.042
He's perfect.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.250
-Uh…
-I love the secret lair.

10:29.250 --> 10:32.292
The garbage and the smell of sadness
pull the whole thing together.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.792
-Wait. Who are you?
-The name's Nimona.

10:34.875 --> 10:37.792
-And how did you--
-Whoa! Yeah! Sick arm.

10:37.875 --> 10:39.125
-Did it bleed a lot?
-What?

10:39.208 --> 10:42.125
-Did they let you keep the old one?
-No. Let go!

10:42.208 --> 10:43.792
What is wrong with you?

10:43.875 --> 10:46.292
-Ooh! Can I have it?
-What? Put that down.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.125
That is not for little girls.

10:48.208 --> 10:50.750
Little girls?

10:50.833 --> 10:52.958
Okay, how old do you think I am?

10:53.042 --> 10:54.292
I don't know. Ten?

10:55.500 --> 10:59.042
-Help me out. More or less than ten?
-Not a lot of kids in your life, huh?

10:59.125 --> 11:01.875
You know what? No. I'd like it
to stay that way. You have to go.

11:01.958 --> 11:03.583
But I'm here about the job.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.167
Job? What job?

11:05.250 --> 11:07.208
It's all here in my application.

11:09.292 --> 11:14.250
This is just a bunch of drawings.
Very disturbing drawings.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.292
Oh, look, it's me.

11:16.375 --> 11:21.083
On a rhinoceros, skewering several guards
like a human kebab.

11:21.167 --> 11:22.833
Yeah! Do you like it?

11:22.917 --> 11:25.875
I thought a visual aid
would really make my resume pop.

11:25.958 --> 11:27.500
-What?
-Up here.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.792
So, about the job?

11:29.875 --> 11:31.333
What job?

11:31.958 --> 11:32.958
To be your sidekick.

11:33.042 --> 11:34.500
To help you do whatever it takes

11:34.583 --> 11:36.917
to get revenge on the cruel world
that rejected you.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.333
Shall we pillage a village?
Lay low until they don't remember you.

11:39.417 --> 11:42.000
Then we rise
like a fiery phoenix from the ashes

11:42.083 --> 11:43.625
to overthrow the government!

11:45.458 --> 11:47.375
Or we could just talk.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.708
The point is,
whatever your dark heart desires, boss.

11:52.792 --> 11:55.208
Your sidekick has arrived.

11:55.292 --> 11:57.458
-I don't need a side--
-Every villain needs a sidekick.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.375
-Wait, I am not a--
-Whoa! Sweet murder wall!

12:00.458 --> 12:01.917
-Murder wall?
-Are these your next targets?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.333
-That's not--
-Who do you wanna kill first?

12:03.417 --> 12:05.583
-I'm not killing anybody.
-This one.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.708
-What?
-This guy looks extremely punchable.

12:07.792 --> 12:11.958
You're right. He is extremely punchable.
No, wait. Look. That is not a murder wall.

12:12.042 --> 12:14.250
It's an… innocence wall?

12:14.333 --> 12:16.125
Innocence wall.

12:16.708 --> 12:19.417
Wait. Are you saying
that you're not a villain?

12:19.500 --> 12:20.667
Yes!

12:22.708 --> 12:24.042
Yes, you are?

12:24.125 --> 12:27.042
No! No, I'm not a villain. No.

12:27.625 --> 12:28.625
Oh.

12:29.208 --> 12:32.417
What? Are you disappointed
that I'm not a murderer?

12:33.625 --> 12:35.500
I mean, a little.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.250
-You know what? We're done here.
-Why?

12:37.333 --> 12:39.833
The real villain is still out there,
and I do need help.

12:39.917 --> 12:42.375
-Not from you.
-Aw, fine! Then from who?

12:42.458 --> 12:44.083
The guy who cut off your arm?

12:44.583 --> 12:46.667
-Seriously?
-It's complicated, okay?

12:46.750 --> 12:48.208
Have fun getting arrested.

12:48.292 --> 12:50.417
I am not gonna get arrested!

12:51.875 --> 12:52.750
Murderer.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.500
-Wanna get some lunch?
-Yeah, I love lunch.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.750
You had to take the arm, huh?

13:08.250 --> 13:09.125
Ballister?

13:09.958 --> 13:11.083
Director?

13:12.875 --> 13:13.917
I'm innocent.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.583
I swear on Gloreth's name.

13:16.667 --> 13:17.917
I don't know how it…

13:18.833 --> 13:19.875
how it happened.

13:20.375 --> 13:22.292
We all saw how it happened.

13:22.958 --> 13:25.917
I feel so foolish, and…

13:27.500 --> 13:28.917
I trusted you.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.667
The queen believed in you.

13:34.125 --> 13:37.000
She thought someone like you
could be a hero.

13:37.625 --> 13:39.792
And it cost her her life.

13:39.875 --> 13:41.417
Director, please.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.792
You know I love the queen.
I love the Institute.

13:44.875 --> 13:46.083
Talk to Goldenloin.

13:46.667 --> 13:48.292
Can I speak to Goldenloin?

13:48.375 --> 13:50.958
He is as heartbroken
as the rest of this kingdom.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.625
You won't be talking
to anyone anymore, Ballister.

13:56.708 --> 13:57.750
Please!

13:57.833 --> 13:59.417
Please, just listen to me.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.958
No. I won't make that mistake again.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.625
Director, give me a chance.

14:08.875 --> 14:10.375
We gave you a chance.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.250
But I didn't do this!

14:16.083 --> 14:17.000
Uhh!

14:22.792 --> 14:24.833
- I told you.
-Oh! Good Gloreth!

14:24.917 --> 14:26.083
Hey, boss.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.542
What? How--

14:27.625 --> 14:30.333
Did I know this was gonna happen?

14:31.042 --> 14:33.583
Because once everyone
sees you as a villain,

14:33.667 --> 14:35.083
that's what you are.

14:35.167 --> 14:38.292
They only see you one way,
no matter how hard you try.

14:39.917 --> 14:43.167
You gave it a good shot, though.
I gotta hand it to you.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.667
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me yet.

14:47.667 --> 14:51.708
-I still gotta get you out of here.
-Wait. How did you get out?

14:51.792 --> 14:54.292
I know the code.
Beep bop boop beep bop.

14:54.375 --> 14:55.917
Invalid password.

14:57.625 --> 14:58.667
After you.

15:02.208 --> 15:03.417
No?

15:03.500 --> 15:05.458
You could sit here
for the rest of eternity,

15:05.542 --> 15:08.750
slowly watching your muscles atrophy,
your skin turning to rot,

15:08.833 --> 15:12.417
your nails growing
into long, curly-fry-looking talons.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.750
You know there's no toilet in there.

15:15.708 --> 15:18.000
Okay, okay, but I lead.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.625
If you see anyone--

15:19.708 --> 15:20.792
Murder 'em.

15:20.875 --> 15:24.542
Hide. If you see anyone, hide.

15:24.625 --> 15:27.583
Fine, because we're still
gonna break stuff.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.083
-That's a hard no.
-Uhh!

15:39.208 --> 15:40.042
Psst.

15:47.458 --> 15:49.792
This place should be crawling with guards.

15:52.167 --> 15:54.292
How exactly did you get past…

15:55.625 --> 15:56.625
…them?

15:57.542 --> 15:59.208
They were like this when I got here.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.625
- Grab them!
- Stop 'em!

16:01.708 --> 16:03.792
-Over here!
-Charge!

16:04.542 --> 16:07.833
The One-Arm Club's about to get
some new members.

16:07.917 --> 16:09.292
Get it?

16:09.375 --> 16:10.208
Uhh!

16:10.292 --> 16:12.250
-What? Too soon?
- Murderer!

16:12.333 --> 16:15.000
He is a murderer… of fun.

16:15.083 --> 16:17.375
-Did you even have a plan?
-This is the plan!

16:17.458 --> 16:20.250
I break you out, chaos, destruction,
something, something, something, we win.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.250
The "old something, something, something,
we win." Terrible plan.

16:23.333 --> 16:26.542
Better than your plan of, "Sit in the dark
and mope in a room with no toilet."

16:26.625 --> 16:28.625
-I was not moping!

16:28.708 --> 16:29.625
Queen killer!

16:29.708 --> 16:31.917
Knights don't mope.
We brood. I was brooding.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.458
Oh.

16:33.542 --> 16:34.792
Okay, fine. You know what?

16:34.875 --> 16:37.042
Why don't we do it your way? Yeah?

16:37.125 --> 16:39.708
Murder him, murder her, murder everyone!

16:41.125 --> 16:42.250
Bal?

16:43.542 --> 16:45.000
-Ambrosius.
-Gesundheit.

16:50.833 --> 16:54.333
Oh, nemesis.

16:54.417 --> 16:55.292
Nemesis?

16:55.375 --> 16:56.333
Queen killer!

16:57.042 --> 16:58.958
-Oh, look! It's Gloreth!
-Where?

17:02.125 --> 17:04.875
- Open the door!
-Not an exit. That's on me.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.458
-Did you see the way he looked at me?

17:08.958 --> 17:10.625
He really thinks I killed the queen.

17:10.708 --> 17:12.750
-Everyone thinks you killed the queen.

17:12.833 --> 17:14.583
-Snap out of it.
-What was that for?

17:14.667 --> 17:17.583
I can get us out of here,
but things are about to get weird.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.333
-About to get weird?
-Promise me you won't freak out.

17:20.417 --> 17:22.292
How, if I don't know what's gonna happen?

17:22.375 --> 17:25.667
-I guess you'll just have to trust me.
-Why would I trust you?

17:25.750 --> 17:26.583
Yaah!

17:26.667 --> 17:29.000
-If you don't, you'll die in this closet!
-Die?

17:29.083 --> 17:30.292
-Now promise!
-I promise.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.000
-Promise promise?
-On my life!

17:32.083 --> 17:34.167
-Then say it again.
-I promise!

17:34.250 --> 17:36.125
Wow. Even when you see the horn?

17:36.208 --> 17:37.875
Horn? You mean like a trumpet?

17:37.958 --> 17:38.833
Just promise!

17:38.917 --> 17:42.125
I promise I will not freak--
Uh…

17:43.708 --> 17:45.375
This is the part where you run.

17:45.458 --> 17:47.958
-Everyone get out of here!

17:53.208 --> 17:54.250
-Yeah!
-Oh no!

17:54.333 --> 17:57.417
No! Stay away! Get back!
No! This is not happening!

17:57.500 --> 17:58.875
Yee-haw!

17:58.958 --> 18:02.042
Oh no. Oh, good Gloreth!

18:02.708 --> 18:04.167
Aah!

18:04.792 --> 18:05.833
Rhinoceros?

18:07.417 --> 18:09.292
-Leave that guy alone!
-Take that!

18:09.875 --> 18:11.542
-No! Not the stairs!
-Ooh, stairs!

18:11.625 --> 18:13.917
-Whoo!
-Not the stairs!

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
-What are you?
-I'm Nimona!

18:16.083 --> 18:19.167
-So, you're a girl and a rhino?
-I'm a lot of things.

18:20.958 --> 18:22.917
-What is happening?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.167
Ohh! Uhh!

18:24.917 --> 18:26.000
Yaah!

18:26.083 --> 18:27.917
-Are you gonna be okay?
-No!

18:28.000 --> 18:29.500
-You promised.
-Right!

18:29.583 --> 18:31.875
Right. You promised not to freak out.

18:31.958 --> 18:33.250
-Turn right!
-Oh!

18:34.375 --> 18:35.208
Halt!

18:35.292 --> 18:36.750
Whoa!

18:38.292 --> 18:40.333
Huh. This floor is surprisingly stable.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.250
Ah, there we go.

18:46.958 --> 18:47.917
-Cold in here?
-Uhh!

18:48.000 --> 18:50.750
Help me! Help me!

18:52.292 --> 18:54.667
You. You did that on purpose.

18:54.750 --> 18:57.417
You catch on quick, boss. Yeah.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.417
No. We've gotta get out of here.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.125
Whoa!

19:04.708 --> 19:07.500
No! No! No! No going down!
No going down!

19:07.583 --> 19:09.958
Staircase! No going down!

19:12.000 --> 19:13.583
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

19:13.667 --> 19:14.583
Yeah!

19:15.125 --> 19:16.125
Ha!

19:16.833 --> 19:17.750
Ha ha!

19:18.250 --> 19:19.875
Oh, no.

19:20.625 --> 19:23.250
Something, something, something, we win.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.333
Metal.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.583

20:28.833 --> 20:30.208
Fifteen years?

20:30.292 --> 20:33.083
Don't be so gullible.
It was just a couple of hours.

20:33.167 --> 20:34.333
Breakfast tacos?

20:35.667 --> 20:39.375
Wait. Wait. Last thing I remember,
we were in a supply closet.

20:39.458 --> 20:41.833
And now… How did I get here?

20:42.375 --> 20:44.833
I dragged you for, like, seven miles.

20:44.917 --> 20:45.792
What happened?

20:45.875 --> 20:48.083
Your head bounced
on the sidewalk a few times.

20:48.167 --> 20:50.125
It's all so foggy.

20:50.208 --> 20:53.708
Really? You thanked me,
said you'd forever be in my debt,

20:53.792 --> 20:56.208
and that we'd always be best friends.

20:57.333 --> 20:58.875
Uh…

20:58.958 --> 20:59.958
Totally happened.

21:00.542 --> 21:02.208
Hey, I spruced up the lair.

21:02.292 --> 21:04.333
I arranged the weapons
in order of deadliness,

21:04.417 --> 21:07.042
unchildproofed the place,
opened the poisons laying around,

21:07.125 --> 21:10.583
and pulled some rusty nails
one centimeter out of the floorboards.

21:10.667 --> 21:13.708
Overall, just made it
much more evil lair-y in here.

21:13.792 --> 21:16.292
Evil Larry.
That's a great villain name.

21:16.375 --> 21:18.458
-You should change your name.
-Never gonna happen.

21:19.042 --> 21:20.375
Whatever, Larry.

21:20.458 --> 21:24.292
And I updated your murder wall.

21:25.625 --> 21:26.458
Oops.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.750
Plus, I drew up plans
for revenge, torment,

21:34.833 --> 21:36.458
and good old general malfeasance.

21:41.708 --> 21:43.292
Rhinoceros.

21:47.792 --> 21:51.458
You look freaked.
You promised you'd hold it together.

21:51.542 --> 21:53.083
You're not human.

21:53.167 --> 21:55.500
-You looking for something?
-My sword.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.375
It exploded. Remember?

21:57.458 --> 21:58.792
You're a mo--

21:58.875 --> 22:03.292
What? Marsupial? Mariachi? Meatball?

22:03.375 --> 22:04.708
You're a monster.

22:04.792 --> 22:06.375
Do not call me that!

22:07.458 --> 22:09.250
No. No, no, no. Of course not.

22:09.333 --> 22:13.042
You're obviously not
a massive fire-breathing, you know--

22:13.125 --> 22:16.042
But you do do
the shifty-shift-shifting-shape thing.

22:16.125 --> 22:18.542
And you're a girl who can turn into--

22:20.500 --> 22:21.333
What are you?

22:22.250 --> 22:23.375
I'm Nimona.

22:23.958 --> 22:26.083
No, that's not an answer.

22:26.167 --> 22:28.583
People don't just turn into things.

22:28.667 --> 22:29.625
I do.

22:29.708 --> 22:32.167
Okay. Fine.
Then I have a million questions.

22:33.250 --> 22:34.292
You get one.

22:38.875 --> 22:40.333
Why are you helping me?

22:41.333 --> 22:42.542
Because I'm bored.

22:45.917 --> 22:47.583
And everybody hates you too.

23:14.417 --> 23:17.667
The squire has to know something.

23:18.375 --> 23:21.792
He's the one that gave me the sword.
The sword that…

23:22.833 --> 23:23.708
that…

23:25.333 --> 23:27.083
You need the squire?

23:27.167 --> 23:29.083
Then let's go kill-- Get him.

23:29.875 --> 23:30.917
Let's go get him.

23:31.875 --> 23:32.792
You and me.

23:32.875 --> 23:34.958
No, absolutely not.

23:35.042 --> 23:38.083
The thing you do? It's too much. No.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.958
I think you're trying to say,
"Thanks for saving my life."

23:41.042 --> 23:43.542
Three times, if you're keeping score.

23:44.250 --> 23:46.500
But you're right.
I'm sure you can do this alone,

23:46.583 --> 23:49.958
with every knight in the entire kingdom
gunning for you. Good luck.

23:52.958 --> 23:53.792
Wait.

23:54.375 --> 23:56.583
Yes, Evil Larry?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.875
-I…
-I'm in.

24:01.333 --> 24:05.667
Here's the thing. When we clear your name,
then I am your official sidekick forever.

24:05.750 --> 24:07.583
No take-backsies. Deal?

24:08.708 --> 24:11.583
-I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.
-Don't overthink it.

24:18.917 --> 24:21.833
Can you just be you, please?

24:21.917 --> 24:22.875
I don't follow.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.208
Girl you.

24:25.292 --> 24:26.417
But I'm not a girl.

24:26.917 --> 24:28.583
I'm a shark.

24:31.625 --> 24:34.542
Hey. You ever put your head
in the mouth of one of these?

24:34.625 --> 24:37.167
-Should've just stayed in jail.
-Come on!

24:37.250 --> 24:38.958
You know you wanna!

24:40.708 --> 24:43.000
Oh man! Look at this place!

24:43.792 --> 24:46.375
A thousand years of history destroyed.

24:47.792 --> 24:49.583
-Huh. Hey, Mansley.
-What?

24:49.667 --> 24:52.458
Your uncle's head
fell on my grandma's butt.

24:54.417 --> 24:55.958
- That's hilarious.
- Nice.

24:56.042 --> 24:57.375
Oh, so sad, though.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.917
Well, if Goldenloin
hadn't helped him…

25:03.000 --> 25:05.542
- I never liked…
-Let me get this straight.

25:06.542 --> 25:08.958
The murderer of the queen escaped

25:09.042 --> 25:13.958
with the help of a girl,
an ostrich, and a whale?

25:15.208 --> 25:17.208
It destroyed our showers!

25:17.708 --> 25:19.667
This is his fault!

25:19.750 --> 25:21.250
- Tell him, Todd.
-Me?

25:21.333 --> 25:24.167
Why didn't you tell us
Ballister was working with whales?

25:24.792 --> 25:25.958
Whales? Really, Todd?

25:26.042 --> 25:29.083
Oh, what? Whale? Really? Yeah.
You knew him better than anyone, bro.

25:29.167 --> 25:31.292
I tried to stop him, bro.

25:31.375 --> 25:35.167
Really? Like this?
"Oh, hi, Ballister. Come right in."

25:35.250 --> 25:39.833
"And of course you can bring your whale,
ostrich, and big fat unicorn."

25:39.917 --> 25:41.542
-Fat unicorn?
-Yeah, you saw it.

25:41.625 --> 25:43.917
-One with the horn that broke everything.
-You mean rhinoceros?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.875
If I meant rhinoperos,
I would have said rhinoperos.

25:45.958 --> 25:47.000
Enough!

25:48.958 --> 25:51.125
There is a villain on the loose
in our kingdom.

25:52.250 --> 25:56.083
Look at you, acting like common children.

25:58.583 --> 26:00.125
Remember your training.

26:01.083 --> 26:03.083
Remember who you are.

26:04.375 --> 26:07.042
We are born to protect this kingdom.

26:08.583 --> 26:10.167
I was born.

26:11.292 --> 26:13.125
Let me take the lead, Director.

26:13.667 --> 26:18.500
There's only two things I want right now.
A, to have a really big sword.

26:19.542 --> 26:20.500
Check.

26:20.583 --> 26:25.500
And three, to treat Ballister
like the queen-killing monster he is.

26:26.208 --> 26:27.917
-I'll hunt him down.
- Yeah!

26:28.000 --> 26:30.333
I'll make it hurt. I'll make--

26:30.417 --> 26:31.833
-I'll do it.
- Huh?

26:31.917 --> 26:32.917
Why?

26:34.167 --> 26:35.625
If anyone can find Bal…

26:36.583 --> 26:38.167
find Ballister

26:39.542 --> 26:41.500
before someone else gets hurt…

26:44.208 --> 26:45.042
it's me.

26:49.167 --> 26:52.833
This is the greatest threat
we've faced in generations.

26:54.917 --> 26:59.500
Thankfully, we have
a descendant of Gloreth to lead us.

26:59.583 --> 27:00.417
What?

27:02.208 --> 27:03.542
Knights of the realm,

27:05.083 --> 27:08.500
search every street, every shadow.

27:09.167 --> 27:12.375
Find Ballister, and bring him to me.

27:12.458 --> 27:15.167
After yesterday's vicious attack
on the Institute,

27:15.250 --> 27:17.625
our knights have redoubled their efforts

27:17.708 --> 27:19.750
in the manhunt for the villain Ballister.

27:19.833 --> 27:21.500
Whew. Okay.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
We just have to get to the market
and find the squire without drawing att--

27:26.083 --> 27:28.375
-Will you be quiet?

27:28.458 --> 27:31.375
Counterpoint.
Your plan sucks, and it's boring.

27:31.458 --> 27:35.208
-Where's the drama? The screams of terror?

27:35.292 --> 27:36.542
-Wait. Shh.

27:36.625 --> 27:39.542
We are villains. Embrace it.

27:39.625 --> 27:43.375
No. We're doing things my way this time.
No one gets hurt.

27:43.458 --> 27:45.458
I was going
for the "hurting people" version.

27:45.542 --> 27:47.917
-We find the squire and question him.
-Then hurt him.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.042
-No. And then find the proof.
-By hurting him.

27:50.125 --> 27:52.125
No. Can we just get to the market, please?

27:52.792 --> 27:53.667
Roger that.

27:53.750 --> 27:56.042
-Next flight leaves in three…
-No. What are you doing?

27:56.125 --> 27:59.250
-…two…
-No-- Boo! I'm a ghost. Heh heh heh.

27:59.333 --> 28:02.250
Eh, sorry.
I can't be seen with that! Aah!

28:02.333 --> 28:04.208
This is quality sidekicking stuff.

28:04.292 --> 28:05.667
It's too much.

28:05.750 --> 28:10.042
Oh, unclench your mustache.
What's the worst that could happen?

28:11.042 --> 28:13.167
Monster attack. Monster attack.

28:13.250 --> 28:15.292
Seek immediate shelter.

28:15.917 --> 28:18.333
Citizens of the realm, hello.

28:18.417 --> 28:21.542
In light of yesterday's horrific attack
on the Institute,

28:21.625 --> 28:24.417
we are taking every precaution
to keep you safe.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.500
Please do not be alarmed.
This is only a test.

28:30.583 --> 28:33.792
Go about your normal lives
and rest assured

28:33.875 --> 28:37.458
that the Institute
has this situation well in hand.

28:37.542 --> 28:41.083
Good day and may Gloreth guide you always.

28:41.167 --> 28:43.500
Do not be alarmed. Please remain calm.

28:43.583 --> 28:45.000
This is only a test.

28:45.083 --> 28:49.208
Oh! A "don't-be-alarmed" alarm. Effective.

28:49.292 --> 28:50.250
Don't you get it?

28:50.333 --> 28:53.667
The second we let our guard down,
something terrible comes over that wall.

28:53.750 --> 28:55.708
Have you ever even been outside the wall?

28:55.792 --> 28:58.958
Yeah, 'cause I have a death wish.
No! No one has!

28:59.042 --> 29:01.458
So, maybe there's nothing there?

29:03.917 --> 29:07.500
You know what? We're going underground.
Without the wings.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.875
You're gonna want 'em later.

29:12.958 --> 29:16.500
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
Go back to the shadows and--

29:16.583 --> 29:17.667
Hey!

29:17.750 --> 29:19.542
-Aw!

29:23.583 --> 29:25.625
Next train arriving in three minutes.

29:25.708 --> 29:30.000
Remember, if you see something,
slay something.

29:32.292 --> 29:34.042
You're watching KTV News.

29:34.792 --> 29:35.667
High five!

29:35.750 --> 29:39.375
After the break, "First Family Fashion,"
what the nobles are wearing this season.

29:40.125 --> 29:42.375
So cool. We're famous.

29:42.458 --> 29:44.083
You've gotta be kidding me.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Ah. I love us.

29:52.750 --> 29:55.250
-Excuse me. I need to see your face.
-Of course.

29:56.167 --> 29:58.667
So then an otter comes around the corner,
and it bit me.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.250
A sea otter or a river otter?

30:00.333 --> 30:02.250
Are you kidding?
Does it matter? It bit me.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.958
There's significant anatomical differences
between the two.

30:05.042 --> 30:07.167
I don't know. It was…

30:07.250 --> 30:10.125
We're never gonna make it on that train
without them seeing us.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.625
We need a distraction.

30:11.708 --> 30:15.125
Who has four thumbs
and is great at distractions?

30:16.125 --> 30:17.458
Fine, but dial it down.

30:17.542 --> 30:20.208
Something inconspicuous
and discreet, like…

30:20.292 --> 30:21.375
And she's gone.

30:21.458 --> 30:23.292
-The queen killer!

30:23.792 --> 30:27.000
If you see something, slay something!

30:27.083 --> 30:30.500
It's Ballister Boldheart!

30:31.083 --> 30:32.042
-Boo!
-Aah!

30:35.875 --> 30:39.667
Yaah! I'm evil, and I hate everybody!

30:40.208 --> 30:43.917
Not as much as I hate myself.
Can somebody give me a hug?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.333
Baah! I hate smiles!

30:46.417 --> 30:48.542
-Got him!
-I hate cupcakes.

30:48.625 --> 30:51.333
And I think babies are ugly!

30:51.417 --> 30:52.667
Hoo hoo!

30:52.750 --> 30:56.083
Look at this!
I'm loitering, and I'm littering.

30:57.542 --> 31:00.417
I hope you all like freestyle jazz.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.417
Get him!

31:04.250 --> 31:06.708
-Hurry up!
-Stop pushing me! I'm trying!

31:06.792 --> 31:08.583
I'm not pushing!
I'm encouraging you forward!

31:08.667 --> 31:10.125
Well, do it without hitting!

31:19.458 --> 31:21.333
Our chariot awaits.

31:21.417 --> 31:24.208
What was that?
And you never said you could turn into me.

31:24.292 --> 31:25.792
By the way, I can turn into you.

31:25.875 --> 31:29.292
Well, for the record,
that is nothing like me.

31:30.708 --> 31:33.208
You're right. You're never that much fun.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.125
- We found him.
-We found him!

31:44.625 --> 31:45.625
Look!

31:48.750 --> 31:51.125
All right, let's go.
Let's get this gutter punk.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.333
-Yes, sir.
-Wait.

31:53.292 --> 31:54.167
Let it run.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.250
Something doesn't feel right.

32:00.625 --> 32:02.250
He hates freestyle jazz.

32:02.333 --> 32:04.375
-You're letting him get away.
-Keep playing.

32:04.458 --> 32:05.667
The clock's ticking.

32:06.250 --> 32:07.542
There.

32:09.583 --> 32:10.417
That's him.

32:10.500 --> 32:11.792
Where's that train headed?

32:11.875 --> 32:14.583
That's the express to the market.
Arrives in six minutes.

32:14.667 --> 32:16.500
And we'll be there to meet him.

32:17.750 --> 32:18.750
Now we go.

32:19.417 --> 32:20.792
-Everyone to the market.
-Yes, sir.

32:20.875 --> 32:24.583
"Everyone to the market. I'm a dork,
and my hair smells like lavender."

32:33.625 --> 32:35.333
- Starving?
-Rahhr!

32:35.417 --> 32:37.250
Kwispy!

32:37.333 --> 32:39.542
Then slay your hunger with Dragon Krisps!

32:40.125 --> 32:42.208
-Crunch!
-Munch!

32:44.333 --> 32:45.333
Take that!

32:45.417 --> 32:46.833
All right, yay!

32:48.542 --> 32:49.542
Yeah!

32:49.625 --> 32:52.125
Dragon Krisps.
Part of your heroic breakfast!

32:52.208 --> 32:53.042
Ecch!

32:58.792 --> 33:00.250
You've been staring.

33:01.125 --> 33:03.417
Did somebody want pizza?

33:03.500 --> 33:05.667
Can you please just be normal
for a second?

33:05.750 --> 33:06.875
Normal?

33:06.958 --> 33:10.292
I just think it'd be easier
if you were a girl.

33:10.375 --> 33:13.375
Easier to be a girl? You're hilarious.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.625
I mean, easier if you look human.

33:15.708 --> 33:17.375
Easier for who?

33:17.458 --> 33:21.375
For you. A lot of people aren't
as accepting as me.

33:22.292 --> 33:24.083
Mm-hmm?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.083
How did you get like this?

33:28.583 --> 33:29.708
What? You mean awesome?

33:29.792 --> 33:33.750
No, how do you-- I'm just trying
to understand what I'm working with here.

33:33.833 --> 33:36.250
I'm Nimona.

33:38.833 --> 33:41.167
That explains literally nothing.

33:43.208 --> 33:44.500
No, you're right.

33:45.917 --> 33:47.833
You deserve
a better explanation than that.

33:49.042 --> 33:50.292
I was just a kid.

33:51.042 --> 33:53.542
Cute, little, innocent me.

33:55.208 --> 33:56.833
I was playing in the woods,

33:57.458 --> 34:00.417
following the birds flying
and the fish swimming

34:00.500 --> 34:02.333
and the deer bounding.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.875
They all looked so happy together,

34:05.500 --> 34:06.417
but I…

34:08.125 --> 34:09.208
I was alone.

34:10.833 --> 34:12.875
-That's when I heard it…

34:12.958 --> 34:15.792
…a song, calling me,

34:15.875 --> 34:18.750
-leading me to a wishing well.

34:18.833 --> 34:21.750
How did you know
it wasn't just a regular well?

34:21.833 --> 34:24.917
-Do you wanna tell my story for me?
-Right. Sorry. Go on.

34:25.417 --> 34:26.917
As I slowly approached the well,

34:27.000 --> 34:30.292
a coin appeared
in the palm of my hand as if by magic.

34:30.375 --> 34:32.458
And I knew what I had to do.

34:32.542 --> 34:34.917
I summoned my courage,
held the coin tight,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.083
threw it into the well, and made a wish.

34:39.000 --> 34:44.083
A wish to one day be trapped on a subway

34:44.167 --> 34:48.708
with an uptight knight
asking me small-minded questions.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.208
Do you still have that pizza?

34:59.667 --> 35:01.542
Now arriving at Market Station.

35:01.625 --> 35:02.625
Cool, we're here.

35:03.333 --> 35:04.333
Oh.

35:04.417 --> 35:06.042
And so are your friends.

35:08.875 --> 35:10.167
Uhh!

35:14.292 --> 35:15.375
Do you think he saw us?

35:19.833 --> 35:20.667
Yes.

35:24.375 --> 35:25.458
Go, go, go!

35:25.542 --> 35:26.833
-Move!
-On the left.

35:27.875 --> 35:28.917
-Clear.

35:29.625 --> 35:30.792
-Clear.
-Moving!

35:35.792 --> 35:38.000
What in the name of Gloreth?

35:39.708 --> 35:41.042
Tiny whale.

35:42.917 --> 35:43.958
Whoa!

35:44.500 --> 35:46.250
Did Goldenloin see you do the thing?

35:46.333 --> 35:49.625
Seriously? That guy cut off your arm, and
you're worried about being seen with me.

35:49.708 --> 35:51.625
-I told you, it's--
-Complicated. I know.

35:51.708 --> 35:52.833
Look! Squire.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.708
Hi. Hi. Uh, excuse me.

35:54.792 --> 35:56.958
Okay. We've gotta get him
out of here quietly.

35:57.042 --> 35:58.292
On it.

35:58.375 --> 36:00.375
Wait, not like that.
Not like that, either.

36:00.458 --> 36:02.667
You want me to shift.
You don't want me to shift. Pick a lane.

36:02.750 --> 36:03.958
And now you're a boy.

36:04.042 --> 36:06.042
-I am today.
-Wait, no!

36:07.208 --> 36:10.208
- Wanted. Wanted. Wanted.
-Excuse me.

36:10.292 --> 36:11.625
-Come on.

36:12.292 --> 36:13.833
I know he's here! Find him!

36:13.917 --> 36:16.500
- Look, it's Goldenloin!
- I can't believe it.

36:16.583 --> 36:17.417
Goldenloin.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.250
-Please move aside.
-Can I get your autograph?

36:19.333 --> 36:21.542
-Just one signature. Who am I signing?
-Do you sign skin?

36:23.667 --> 36:25.375
- Don't move!

36:26.125 --> 36:29.667
'Cause if you do, you're gonna miss out
on a great deal today!

36:29.750 --> 36:31.875
Excuse me, Mr. Squire, sir.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.917
I can't find my mommy.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.875
She went to that scary alley over there.

36:37.958 --> 36:39.958
Can you help me find her?

36:40.833 --> 36:43.000
Please?

36:43.708 --> 36:45.583
Oh, no.

36:45.667 --> 36:49.833
Let me go ahead and pass this problem
on to someone else.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.958
- There's no time!
-Aah!

36:52.042 --> 36:55.708
This baby's fully loaded.
State-of-the-art sound system.

36:57.458 --> 36:59.792
There. Can we just part the waters?

36:59.875 --> 37:01.542
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Move aside.

37:01.625 --> 37:03.958
Please help me. Help me, please.

37:04.042 --> 37:06.458
A little demon baby is after me.
Please help me.

37:06.542 --> 37:08.000
-Aah!

37:08.750 --> 37:09.708
Aah!

37:09.792 --> 37:10.625
Check this out.

37:10.708 --> 37:14.417
With our 360-degree dashcams,
you'll always see what's coming.

37:14.500 --> 37:18.667
And our news feature will keep you
up to date with the kingdom's headlines.

37:18.750 --> 37:22.333
-Uh, you look a lot like--
-I'm innocent!

37:22.417 --> 37:23.917
Help!

37:24.000 --> 37:25.667
No!

37:28.042 --> 37:30.042
Pineapple on pizza? Bleah!

37:30.125 --> 37:32.375
-There!
-Excuse me. I need to get through. Move!

37:32.458 --> 37:34.208
-Uh-oh.
-Ah ha ha ha!

37:37.167 --> 37:40.292
-Aw. Why did you get to kill him?
-He's not dead. I hope.

37:40.375 --> 37:42.667
- Is that Ballister?
- It's the queen killer!

37:42.750 --> 37:45.458
-He's working with a demon baby!
-I thought he ate babies!

37:45.542 --> 37:47.250
Ballister! Stop! Halt

37:49.125 --> 37:50.833
-Yeah!
- Get in!

37:50.917 --> 37:52.625
-Bal!
-Shoot him in the face!

37:57.083 --> 37:58.292
What are you doing?

37:58.917 --> 37:59.958
We'll take it.

38:00.583 --> 38:01.417
Aah!

38:05.833 --> 38:07.333
-Dang it!

38:11.375 --> 38:14.833
I hate to say it,
but you make a pretty good bad guy.

38:40.583 --> 38:43.333
Oh! Yep. I like it.

38:43.417 --> 38:47.042
We're gonna shake this dude down
in this sketchy part of town.

38:47.125 --> 38:50.417
Look, let's just question the squire
and get out-- Your leg.

38:50.500 --> 38:53.458
-Huh?
-There's an arrow in your leg!

38:53.542 --> 38:55.792
-Oh.
-Okay, you really need to sit down.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.625
-No, it's fine. It's totally--
-Look at you. You're not fine.

38:58.708 --> 39:01.583
-It's a splinter. It'll work itself out.
-You're bleeding. Sit.

39:03.125 --> 39:05.375
We're just gonna take a look, okay?

39:06.333 --> 39:08.583
Yah! Okay. Okay. Okay.

39:08.667 --> 39:10.917
That's-- It's-- That's in there.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.625
Uh, everything's fine.
We're just gonna…

39:15.250 --> 39:16.625
We're gonna do this on three.

39:19.625 --> 39:20.583
You ready?

39:23.458 --> 39:26.792
One, two, three.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.875
Okay, most people scream at that part.

39:34.333 --> 39:35.583
I'm not a people.

39:35.667 --> 39:36.542
Right.

39:37.417 --> 39:39.125
Right. Um…

39:40.167 --> 39:42.500
-does it hurt at all?
-It does.

39:43.875 --> 39:45.667
But I've been through worse.

39:48.458 --> 39:50.417
What does it feel like?

39:50.500 --> 39:52.917
Pretty stabby in my leg region.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.417
No. No. The shape shifting.

39:56.500 --> 39:58.208
Does it hurt, or does it--

39:59.708 --> 40:01.708
Sorry. Small-minded question.

40:03.750 --> 40:04.625
Hold still.

40:16.667 --> 40:17.625
Honestly?

40:19.125 --> 40:21.042
I feel worse when I don't do it.

40:21.125 --> 40:23.375
Like my insides are itchy.

40:24.083 --> 40:26.375
You know that second
right before you sneeze?

40:27.000 --> 40:28.125
That's close to it.

40:29.500 --> 40:32.708
Then I shape-shift, and I'm free.

40:36.583 --> 40:38.000
What if you held it in?

40:39.667 --> 40:41.417
If you didn't shape-shift?

40:41.500 --> 40:43.875
-I'd die.
-Good Gloreth, that's horrible!

40:43.958 --> 40:46.625
Don't be so gullible. I wouldn't die die.

40:46.708 --> 40:49.500
I just sure wouldn't be living.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.583
So nice to hear you guys bonding.

40:53.667 --> 40:58.500
Ah, it's such a shame I have to go.
Let me go.

40:58.583 --> 41:03.542
Oh yeah, the punk in the trunk.
Let's go dunk on the punk in the trunk.

41:06.083 --> 41:07.625
-Start talking.
-He wants blood.

41:07.708 --> 41:08.958
-Blood?
-Your blood!

41:09.042 --> 41:10.542
-I don't want blood.
-Buckets of blood!

41:10.625 --> 41:12.625
What I want is answers, so start talking.

41:12.708 --> 41:13.917
Or we start stabbing.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.125
-No stabbing.
-Slapping.

41:15.208 --> 41:17.292
No! Why did you set me up?

41:17.375 --> 41:18.542
-I didn't.
-Then who?

41:18.625 --> 41:19.458
-You!
-No!

41:19.542 --> 41:20.375
-Who?
-Let me explain.

41:20.458 --> 41:21.500
Blanche? Chad? Todd?

41:21.583 --> 41:22.792
-Todd?
-Punchable face guy?

41:22.875 --> 41:24.792
Of course.
Todd swapped my sword, didn't he?

41:24.875 --> 41:26.458
-What? No.
-Why are you protecting him?

41:26.542 --> 41:27.542
Who'd protect Todd?

41:27.625 --> 41:30.167
Guess we're just gonna
have to do things the hard way.

41:30.250 --> 41:32.667
Hard way? Hold on a second.
Wait. Just wait.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.333
Peekaboo.

41:34.417 --> 41:36.708
Yaah! Here, look.

41:37.375 --> 41:39.167
Check it out. I'm in the locker room,

41:39.250 --> 41:42.208
and you are looking at history
in the making.

41:42.292 --> 41:45.458
Ballister's armor. It's speaking.

41:45.542 --> 41:49.792
It's saying, "Respect me. Protect me.
Put me on. No one's watching."

41:50.750 --> 41:52.250
Awkward.

41:52.333 --> 41:54.042
Oh, we can just fast-forward.

41:54.833 --> 41:56.750
Okay, this is the part you have to see.

42:18.667 --> 42:20.167
The Director set me up.

42:20.875 --> 42:22.292
She killed the queen.

42:23.417 --> 42:27.125
I, I didn't know what to do.
I tried to show you before…

42:29.125 --> 42:30.833
None of this makes sense.

42:34.875 --> 42:36.458
Oh. Hey, buddy.

42:37.333 --> 42:39.500
I'm sorry for kidnapping you.

42:40.375 --> 42:41.375
It's okay.

42:41.458 --> 42:42.958
- Or am I?
-Oh! Oh!

42:46.125 --> 42:47.208
Ha ha!

42:50.542 --> 42:53.083
Look, boss, you got betrayed
by someone you trusted.

42:53.167 --> 42:57.500
I get it. It sucks. But we did it.
You're innocent, and we have the proof.

42:57.583 --> 42:59.208
-Once we upload that video--
-We're not.

42:59.292 --> 43:01.417
What? Everybody needs to know the truth.

43:01.500 --> 43:04.083
The system is jacked.
The Institute needs to shut down.

43:04.167 --> 43:05.375
Will you be quiet?

43:05.458 --> 43:07.417
Prospective target.
Clear on Avenue Three. Over.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.708
I will not be quiet about this.

43:09.792 --> 43:12.417
This video could damage people's faith
in the Institute.

43:12.500 --> 43:13.667
No duh!

43:13.750 --> 43:18.083
Look, I don't know why she framed me,
but the Institute's not the problem.

43:18.167 --> 43:19.333
The Director is.

43:20.125 --> 43:22.083
That's why I'm taking this to Ambrosius.

43:22.167 --> 43:24.042
-Who cares?
-Ambro--

43:25.292 --> 43:29.625
This is the man who cut off your arm.
Arm-chopping is not a love language!

43:29.708 --> 43:33.125
He didn't cut off my arm.
He disarmed a weapon.

43:34.875 --> 43:36.375
It's how we were trained.

43:38.292 --> 43:39.792
Wow!

43:40.375 --> 43:42.583
They brainwashed you good.

43:43.500 --> 43:46.000
You think this stops with the Director?

43:46.083 --> 43:48.542
You should be
questioning everything right now.

43:48.625 --> 43:51.125
The will of Gloreth,
the Institute, the wall.

43:51.208 --> 43:52.458
What's it all really for?

43:52.542 --> 43:54.125
For protecting the realm.

43:54.208 --> 43:56.125
You mean from villains like you?

43:57.708 --> 43:59.042
Or monsters

44:00.083 --> 44:00.917
like me?

44:05.417 --> 44:09.417
Look, if we get this to Ambrosius,
everything is gonna be okay.

44:10.542 --> 44:11.708
For both of us.

44:17.667 --> 44:22.917
Okay, fine. But when things go south,
I'm breaking stuff.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.125
-That won't be necessary.

44:40.708 --> 44:42.917
Is something on your mind, Ambrosius?

44:45.542 --> 44:46.958
You can talk to me.

44:48.375 --> 44:49.292
My mind?

44:50.208 --> 44:52.167
I've lost my mind.

44:53.042 --> 44:54.292
I've lost everything.

44:55.125 --> 44:57.375
The man I love, my best friend.

44:58.042 --> 45:01.000
Although now he's got a new best friend.
What's that about?

45:01.083 --> 45:03.625
What else is he hiding?
Who is the real him?

45:03.708 --> 45:04.583
Who am I?

45:04.667 --> 45:07.708
A direct descendant of Gloreth?
I never asked for that.

45:07.792 --> 45:09.792
Now everyone expects me
to arrest Ballister.

45:09.875 --> 45:13.583
If I don't, I'm a traitor to you.
If I do, I'm a traitor to him.

45:13.667 --> 45:16.500
Oh, and on top of that,
I chopped off his arm!

45:16.583 --> 45:19.125
His arm! Who chops off an arm?

45:19.208 --> 45:22.292
Because I was trained to?
Arm chopping is not a love langua--

45:25.292 --> 45:26.583
I'm fine, Director.

45:46.500 --> 45:49.000
-Ma'am.
-Stay strong, Ambrosius.

45:49.083 --> 45:51.833
The blood of Gloreth
runs through your veins.

45:53.333 --> 45:54.917
-Ambrosius.
-Knights!

45:56.250 --> 45:58.458
They were like this when I got here.

45:59.167 --> 46:00.000
You.

46:00.083 --> 46:01.500
Me.

46:02.375 --> 46:05.333
Ambrosius, the Director killed the queen.

46:05.917 --> 46:08.125
-What?
-Another desperate lie.

46:08.208 --> 46:09.625
He's not a liar.

46:09.708 --> 46:12.542
Says the miscreant, whispering in his ear.

46:12.625 --> 46:13.917
Aw, thank you.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.583
I'm innocent, and I have proof.

46:17.792 --> 46:19.958
-He's got a weapon.
-No!

46:20.042 --> 46:22.292
Not anymore! Todd rules!

46:26.958 --> 46:29.542
It doesn't matter.
You shouldn't need proof.

46:29.625 --> 46:31.417
You know I'm not a murderer.

46:34.250 --> 46:35.875
What are you waiting for, Captain?

46:37.875 --> 46:40.208
Hurry before the whale gets here.

46:41.083 --> 46:42.292
Come on, man.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.167
Do the right thing.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.417
Who is she, Bal?

46:49.542 --> 46:51.083
What is she?

46:51.167 --> 46:54.542
Ambrosius, I am begging you to trust me.

47:00.792 --> 47:01.792
Arrest them.

47:03.167 --> 47:04.750
You wanna know who the kid is?

47:04.833 --> 47:07.458
Oh, I like where this is going.

47:07.542 --> 47:08.667
You wanna show 'em?

47:08.750 --> 47:09.958
I'd love to.

47:10.042 --> 47:11.375
Let's break stuff.

47:11.458 --> 47:12.792
Metal.

47:13.750 --> 47:15.000
Is that a gorilla?

47:15.083 --> 47:15.917
Oh!

47:20.250 --> 47:21.125
Bloop.

47:23.500 --> 47:26.292
-Give me a sword.
-We need to get you to safety.

47:28.875 --> 47:31.042
-Aah!
-Get this thing in the air now!

47:40.042 --> 47:41.833
-Oh!
-Sorry, not sorry!

47:46.042 --> 47:48.125
-You see a way out of here?
-Of horse I do.

47:48.208 --> 47:49.625
Okay, that was terrible.

47:49.708 --> 47:51.250
Stop that… horse?

47:52.167 --> 47:55.250
-We're going over, aren't we?
-Yep! The only way out is down.

47:55.333 --> 47:58.667
-Horse!
-Why are we always falling?!

47:58.750 --> 48:02.208
Ha ha! Told you you'd want the wings.
Whoo-hoo!

48:06.750 --> 48:08.375
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

48:13.125 --> 48:16.042
-Okay, that was super gross.
-Ha ha, I know!

48:22.167 --> 48:24.125
Well, if it isn't the golden boy.

48:25.917 --> 48:28.708
-That's the otter that bit me!
-I can see your confusion.

48:28.792 --> 48:31.500
It has the tail of a river otter,
but the webbed back feet--

48:32.917 --> 48:36.542
Did I ever mean anything to you?
Or was it all just a lie?

48:36.625 --> 48:39.833
A lie? Says the guy running around
with a monster!

48:39.917 --> 48:43.875
Don't call her that! She's smart,
kind, and quite sophisticated.

48:43.958 --> 48:46.333
That guy just peed his armor!
He peed his armor!

48:46.417 --> 48:48.583
And she has my back, unlike you.

48:48.667 --> 48:50.417
You lied to me about everything!

48:50.500 --> 48:52.875
Only one lying to you is the Director!

48:53.458 --> 48:56.083
What? You're gonna kill me now too?

48:56.167 --> 48:57.167
You believe that?

49:01.208 --> 49:02.875
Then you never knew me at all.

49:10.458 --> 49:14.208
Yeah. Now I'm gonna punch you in the face.

49:15.500 --> 49:18.417
Now, I'm no doctor,
but this cast looks delicious.

49:20.167 --> 49:21.000
Boss?

49:28.792 --> 49:30.250
You think this hurts?

49:30.333 --> 49:32.833
Wait till you see what we do
to your pet monster.

49:35.917 --> 49:37.625
No! Leave her alone!

49:43.292 --> 49:45.625
Kwispy! Wait, what?

49:45.708 --> 49:47.000
Hope you brought milk.

49:47.583 --> 49:48.875
No!

49:52.042 --> 49:53.833
Wait, wait! No, no!

49:58.500 --> 49:59.417
What?

50:06.958 --> 50:09.083
Monster attack. Monster attack.

50:09.167 --> 50:11.000
Seek immediate shelter.

50:12.458 --> 50:14.917
-Monster attack. Monster attack.
-It's okay.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.333
…immediate shelter.

50:16.958 --> 50:19.750
-Monster attack. Monster attack.
-M-Monster.

50:19.833 --> 50:20.667
…immediate shelter.

50:22.250 --> 50:24.500
Monster attack. Monster attack.

50:24.583 --> 50:26.208
Seek immediate shelter.

50:27.917 --> 50:30.125
-Monster attack.
- Her! Come on!

50:30.208 --> 50:32.708
-I've got you, kid!
-No! Stop!

50:42.333 --> 50:44.333
-Are you okay?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

50:44.417 --> 50:47.083
-I know something's wrong.
-I said I don't wanna talk about it!

50:47.167 --> 50:48.500
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

50:48.583 --> 50:50.042
I don't need your help!

50:59.792 --> 51:02.292
Did you see the way
that little girl looked at me?

51:03.917 --> 51:04.792
Kids.

51:05.708 --> 51:06.875
Little kids.

51:08.375 --> 51:11.208
They grow up believing
that they can be a hero

51:11.292 --> 51:14.708
if they drive a sword into the heart
of anything different.

51:16.417 --> 51:17.833
And I'm the monster?

51:23.000 --> 51:24.667
I don't know what's scarier.

51:28.208 --> 51:32.875
The fact that everyone in this kingdom
wants to run a sword through my heart…

51:36.125 --> 51:37.417
or that sometimes

51:38.583 --> 51:39.833
I just wanna let 'em.

51:44.208 --> 51:45.833
We have to get you out of here.

51:47.083 --> 51:48.250
We'll go over the wall.

51:48.333 --> 51:51.375
We won't stop
until we find someplace safe.

51:51.458 --> 51:53.208
Okay, we'll go together.

51:54.000 --> 51:54.833
Together?

51:54.917 --> 51:58.958
Listen, you were right about everything.
The Institute, the wall…

52:00.417 --> 52:01.417
Ambrosius.

52:04.583 --> 52:08.083
No matter what we do,
we can't change the way people see us.

52:11.042 --> 52:12.667
You changed the way you see me.

52:16.958 --> 52:17.792
Didn't you?

52:23.667 --> 52:26.000
We can't let the Director
get away with this.

52:26.083 --> 52:27.583
We shouldn't have to run.

52:28.500 --> 52:30.292
And you made a deal, right?

52:30.375 --> 52:33.292
We clear your name,
you make me your sidekick.

52:33.375 --> 52:36.333
You can't back out on a deal
because you believe in truth and honor

52:36.417 --> 52:38.375
and blah, blah, blah.
All that stupid stuff.

52:39.417 --> 52:42.042
Truth and honor aren't stupid,
but all right.

52:42.125 --> 52:44.250
So, you got a plan?

52:44.333 --> 52:45.583
'Course I got a plan.

52:46.417 --> 52:48.375
Something, something, something…

52:48.917 --> 52:50.458
We win.

52:58.333 --> 53:00.750
Excuse me, but the Director
isn't available right now.

53:02.333 --> 53:03.333
We need to talk!

53:04.292 --> 53:05.208
Alone.

53:11.625 --> 53:13.375
Was Ballister telling the truth?

53:13.917 --> 53:18.625
He could've said anybody killed the queen,
but he said you. Why you?

53:19.958 --> 53:23.708
Sir Goldenloin,
is your loyalty to this kingdom

53:23.792 --> 53:26.375
or to a knight
who consorts with a monster?

53:27.417 --> 53:29.292
Did you swap his sword?

53:29.375 --> 53:31.000
Did you set him up?

53:31.083 --> 53:32.250
Tell me the truth!

53:40.667 --> 53:44.708
Ever since I was young,
I've had the same nightmare.

53:46.833 --> 53:48.667
I find a crack in the wall.

53:50.042 --> 53:51.125
I yell out,

53:52.000 --> 53:54.792
but no one listens.

53:56.583 --> 54:00.083
And the crack grows bigger and bigger

54:00.833 --> 54:02.667
until the wall crumbles

54:03.833 --> 54:05.417
and the monsters pour in.

54:08.083 --> 54:11.208
I begged the queen
not to question the word of Gloreth.

54:11.708 --> 54:15.042
Not to question what's kept us safe
for a thousand years.

54:15.708 --> 54:17.208
But she wouldn't listen.

54:19.708 --> 54:23.792
Allowing Ballister to hold the sword
was the first crack in the wall.

54:26.333 --> 54:27.250
And now

54:28.292 --> 54:30.250
we have a monster in our kingdom.

54:30.792 --> 54:31.917
Is that…

54:33.667 --> 54:35.458
I'm sorry, Ambrosius.

54:38.375 --> 54:39.417
Ahh…

54:46.250 --> 54:47.792
Ohh!

54:49.708 --> 54:52.708
So, yes, I framed Ballister.

54:53.583 --> 54:54.708
I killed the queen.

54:58.750 --> 55:01.875
Gloreth did whatever it took
to keep the monsters out.

55:05.875 --> 55:06.958
And so will I.

55:10.667 --> 55:11.917
Ahh.

55:23.375 --> 55:25.083
May Gloreth forgive you.

55:26.875 --> 55:29.833
So, yes, I framed Ballister.

55:29.917 --> 55:31.333
I killed the queen.

55:31.417 --> 55:33.750
I can't wait for the kingdom to see this.

55:33.833 --> 55:34.917
You.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.708
Well, and my sidekick.
Round of applause, ladies and gents.

55:37.792 --> 55:42.292
Was my acting okay? I was a little worried
my last "Ehh" was too over the top.

55:42.375 --> 55:44.917
If you're looking for feedback,
it was a little dramatic.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.083
You won't win any awards, but it was good.

55:47.167 --> 55:48.333
I've never taken a class.

55:48.417 --> 55:49.667
Really? That's a surprise.

55:49.750 --> 55:52.500
Not a one.
Oh, don't forget your sword, boss.

55:52.583 --> 55:53.792
Eh, she can keep it.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.667
I don't fight for her anymore.

55:56.750 --> 55:58.417
You called me your sidekick.

55:58.500 --> 55:59.583
I did, didn't I?

55:59.667 --> 56:01.500
You called me your sidekick.

56:01.583 --> 56:03.250
And I regret it already.

56:03.333 --> 56:06.542
You called me your sidekick.
You called me…

56:08.292 --> 56:09.458
We need to talk.

56:11.958 --> 56:12.792
Bad time?

56:18.917 --> 56:20.083
Come on, come on!

56:21.708 --> 56:22.833
Whoo-hoo!

56:22.917 --> 56:26.208
Yes! Let's take that pooch for a walk.

56:26.292 --> 56:27.583
Eight, nine, ten.

56:27.667 --> 56:31.583
Ooh, landing you in the Enchanted Forest,
which is my domain.

56:31.667 --> 56:33.542
Cha-ching. 600 gold, please.

56:33.625 --> 56:36.542
My Scottie dog
will not pay your tyrannical toll.

56:36.625 --> 56:39.875
He rallies the oppressed
woodland creatures and starts a rebellion.

56:39.958 --> 56:42.583
Squirrels scale the castle walls!

56:43.375 --> 56:47.167
Bears batter down the gates!
Letting chaos ensue!

56:55.583 --> 56:57.667
-I'm still taking the 600 gold.
-What?

57:01.708 --> 57:04.083
You didn't tell me you could breathe fire.

57:04.958 --> 57:06.375
Oh.

57:07.458 --> 57:10.417
Metal. Best two out of three?

57:13.417 --> 57:14.250
What?

57:15.292 --> 57:16.292
Nothing.

57:19.750 --> 57:21.167
Hey, check it out.

57:22.667 --> 57:25.000
Whoa! A hundred-- 500-- 30,000--

57:25.083 --> 57:28.542
Seventy-five--
The whole kingdom is seeing this thing.

57:28.625 --> 57:31.458
Well, I guess
there's only one question left.

57:31.542 --> 57:32.667
What's that?

57:33.292 --> 57:34.667
Can a shark dance?

57:34.750 --> 57:36.458
Can a shark dance?

57:38.292 --> 57:39.875
Watch me.

57:46.708 --> 57:49.583
Still reeling from the monster attack,
the kingdom is rocked

57:49.667 --> 57:53.750
by new footage of the Director
making a truly shocking confession.

57:53.833 --> 57:56.542
I framed Ballister. I killed the queen.

57:57.708 --> 58:00.458
I framed Ballister. I killed the queen.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.250

Director!

59:14.833 --> 59:18.333
You're under arrest
for the murder of the queen and for--

59:18.417 --> 59:21.708
Ambrosius. This explains everything.

59:28.958 --> 59:31.583
Zombies are immortal, eternal
beings. There's no way to kill them.

59:31.667 --> 59:33.375
But what if they come for us?

59:38.417 --> 59:43.208
I can't believe I'm about to say this,
but I actually feel bad for the zombies.

59:56.667 --> 59:58.250
-Stop. Don't.
-Hey.

59:59.125 --> 01:00:00.083
Hey.

01:00:00.167 --> 01:00:01.792
It's okay. You're safe.

01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:04.250
-We're home.
-Home?

01:00:09.833 --> 01:00:11.125
I like it here.

01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:14.125
Let's live here forever.

01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:50.750
-You have 30 seconds.
-Thirty seconds?

01:00:50.833 --> 01:00:53.125
-That's a lot more than you've given me.
-I'm here to save you.

01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:55.917
-You are so full of--
-Hey! Can I get you guys something?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.208
-Nachos!

01:00:57.917 --> 01:00:58.750
Please.

01:00:59.458 --> 01:01:01.000
And hold the olives.

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:02.500
He's allergic.

01:01:02.583 --> 01:01:05.583
Bal, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't important.

01:01:05.667 --> 01:01:07.875
And I wouldn't be here
if you'd stood up for me.

01:01:07.958 --> 01:01:08.917
That is not fair.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
-We're done. So is she.
-We now go live to the Institute.

01:01:11.083 --> 01:01:13.958
-There is something I need to tell you.
- Hey, turn that up.

01:01:14.042 --> 01:01:18.333
Citizens of the realm,
that is not me in the recording.

01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:22.833
I know it looks like me
and sounds like me, but it is not me.

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:28.083
That was the monster working
with the real queen killer, Ballister.

01:01:28.583 --> 01:01:30.208
They are trying to trick you.

01:01:30.292 --> 01:01:31.625
That's a lie.

01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:34.625
We are under attack
by something that can take any form.

01:01:34.708 --> 01:01:36.292
It could be anyone.

01:01:36.375 --> 01:01:39.708
Your spouse, your child, your best friend,

01:01:39.792 --> 01:01:41.625
the person sitting next to you.

01:01:42.125 --> 01:01:43.750
None of us are safe

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:48.292
so long as the villain and that monster
are still out there.

01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:50.000
She's twisting everything.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.792
Ambrosius, I'm not the villain here.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:53.708
I know.

01:01:54.667 --> 01:01:55.750
I know.

01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:58.625
I believe you.

01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:02.792
I…

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
I'm sorry

01:02:05.958 --> 01:02:08.417
for everything.

01:02:09.583 --> 01:02:11.250
For your arm.

01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:16.500
She manipulated you.

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:19.708
She manipulated both of us,

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:24.500
but together, we'll take her down
and prove it to the kingdom.

01:02:25.958 --> 01:02:27.250
You'll be a knight again.

01:02:29.542 --> 01:02:32.500
Thank you. The Director can't get away--

01:02:32.583 --> 01:02:33.625
The Director?

01:02:36.042 --> 01:02:39.875
Bal, I'm talking about your sidekick.

01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:42.000
Your sidekick set you up.

01:02:42.083 --> 01:02:42.917
What?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.333
This was all her plan.

01:02:45.875 --> 01:02:46.833
All of it.

01:02:48.125 --> 01:02:50.125
She's evil, Bal.

01:02:50.208 --> 01:02:51.750
E-Evil?

01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:55.417
No, you're wrong.
We've been wrong about everything.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.500
Wrong about everything? Then explain this.

01:02:58.583 --> 01:03:00.125
This scroll has been
in the Institute vaults

01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:02.000
for a thousand years.

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:05.333
Look at it.

01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:08.792
It's her, Bal.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.833
She's Gloreth's monster.

01:03:12.708 --> 01:03:14.708
She's come back
to finish what she started,

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:17.167
and she's using you to do it.

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:19.500
But she's my friend.

01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:21.000
Aren't I more than that?

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:24.625
We can slay this monster.
We can go back to the way things were.

01:03:24.708 --> 01:03:26.292
-This was a mistake.
-Bal, please.

01:03:26.375 --> 01:03:29.042
-No, I can't do this. I'm done!
-Listen to me!

01:03:29.125 --> 01:03:31.167
She's using you to destroy the kingdom!

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:32.708
-You know what she is.
-Stop!

01:03:32.792 --> 01:03:36.625
-Why won't you admit it? You're in danger!
-Why can't you just leave me alone?

01:03:41.167 --> 01:03:42.833
Because I love you.

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:11.250
Ohh.
I have not slept like that in forever.

01:04:14.333 --> 01:04:16.458
Why do you have your cloak on?

01:04:19.917 --> 01:04:20.833
Is this you?

01:04:21.875 --> 01:04:25.083
Where did you get that?
Who have you been talking--

01:04:25.167 --> 01:04:26.583
Tell me this isn't you.

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:29.792
You think that I would do that?

01:04:29.875 --> 01:04:31.375
That that's who I am?

01:04:31.458 --> 01:04:32.417
I don't know.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.750
You're the one who told me
not to trust anybody, question everything.

01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:37.542
That's right! Even now, with this,

01:04:37.625 --> 01:04:40.708
think about everything
we have been through together.

01:04:40.792 --> 01:04:42.833
I'm thinking about everything we've done.

01:04:42.917 --> 01:04:47.458
Broken out of jail, stolen cars,
kidnapped people, manipulated people.

01:04:47.542 --> 01:04:48.542
I was helping you.

01:04:48.625 --> 01:04:51.375
You were using me!
You wanted them to see a villain.

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:53.875
Someone else to hate
so you wouldn't be alone.

01:04:54.583 --> 01:04:57.250
Because you're not a sidekick.
You're a m--

01:04:57.333 --> 01:04:59.958
What? I'm a what?

01:05:00.042 --> 01:05:01.708
You know what you are.

01:05:01.792 --> 01:05:03.542
No, I want to hear you say it.

01:05:05.542 --> 01:05:06.833
Come on, say it.

01:05:07.833 --> 01:05:08.917
Say it!

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.292
Say that I'm a mon--

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.250
-I…
- Surround the place.

01:05:17.333 --> 01:05:18.500
You two with me.

01:05:24.917 --> 01:05:26.292
Your door is broken.

01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:51.250
No.

01:06:52.667 --> 01:06:53.500
Whoo!

01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:07.375
-Whoo-hoo!

01:08:11.667 --> 01:08:13.083
Ohh!

01:08:49.708 --> 01:08:52.958
-Stay back!
-No! Stop! Stop! She's my friend!

01:08:53.042 --> 01:08:54.333
She's a monster.

01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:03.208
Surround it!

01:09:15.167 --> 01:09:16.000
No!

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Stop!

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.833
Fire! Fire!

01:09:46.375 --> 01:09:47.250
Gloreth.

01:09:49.208 --> 01:09:50.708
Gloreth! Come here!

01:09:52.667 --> 01:09:53.542
Gloreth--

01:09:57.583 --> 01:10:00.792
Go back to the shadows
from whence you came.

01:10:00.875 --> 01:10:02.333
came, came, came…

01:10:17.583 --> 01:10:19.083
- What are you
- A monster.

01:10:19.167 --> 01:10:20.625
Are you even human?

01:10:20.708 --> 01:10:21.833
Just be a girl.

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.917
There is no place for you!

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.542
- Don't lie to me!
- She's a monster.

01:10:25.625 --> 01:10:26.750
Don't you wish you were normal?

01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:28.792
Go back to the shadows
from whence you came.

01:10:28.875 --> 01:10:30.292
There's something wrong
with you. What are you?

01:10:30.375 --> 01:10:32.292
- Monster!
- You know what you are!

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.458
You brought a monster into our home.

01:10:40.583 --> 01:10:43.042
You should've stayed in the gutter
where you belong.

01:10:43.125 --> 01:10:44.375
Now where is it?

01:10:47.167 --> 01:10:48.625
Do you feel that?

01:10:48.708 --> 01:10:52.542
I feel like the whole place kind of went
like "wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba, wubba."

01:10:58.542 --> 01:10:59.375
No.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:10.417
It's headed straight for the city.
Alert the Institute.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:11.750
And you.

01:11:11.833 --> 01:11:15.750
If that thing destroys the kingdom,
it's on you, bro.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:17.417
Let's go!

01:11:27.667 --> 01:11:29.708
Ma'am, incoming report from Sir Thodeus.

01:11:29.792 --> 01:11:31.708
-And? What is it?
- Whoa.

01:11:38.292 --> 01:11:39.417
-What is that?
-What's going on?

01:11:41.458 --> 01:11:43.417
We need barricades on Avenue A through F.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.458
And can we clear the streets?
These people are in danger.

01:12:10.125 --> 01:12:11.167
It's happening.

01:12:12.083 --> 01:12:15.667
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!
Hit it with everything we've got.

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:19.458
Monster attack. Monster attack.

01:12:19.542 --> 01:12:20.917
This is not a test.

01:12:21.542 --> 01:12:23.542
Monster attack. Monster attack.

01:12:23.625 --> 01:12:25.333
This is not a test.

01:12:25.417 --> 01:12:27.708
Monster attack. Monster attack.

01:12:29.375 --> 01:12:30.958
It's the monster!

01:12:36.292 --> 01:12:37.500
Everyone stay calm.

01:12:51.083 --> 01:12:52.167
Drones engaged.

01:13:05.625 --> 01:13:06.500
Look out!

01:13:08.583 --> 01:13:09.625
You're okay.

01:13:10.208 --> 01:13:14.042
Hey, Goldie.
Watch how a real knight gets it done.

01:13:14.625 --> 01:13:16.125
All right, monster slayers.

01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:19.208
Let's shoot some darts
and break some hearts.

01:13:19.292 --> 01:13:21.667
I'm gonna be a freaking hero.

01:13:23.042 --> 01:13:24.375
Aah!

01:13:26.333 --> 01:13:27.625
Out of my way!

01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:30.875
We need more firepower!
This thing is gonna kill us all!

01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:32.125
Look out!

01:13:33.917 --> 01:13:35.833
-High five!
-Bro.

01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:38.292
Get out of here!

01:13:43.292 --> 01:13:44.417
Get me to the wall.

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:49.000
Monster attack. Monster attack.

01:13:49.083 --> 01:13:52.125
Monster attack. Monster attack.

01:13:52.208 --> 01:13:56.500
Monster attack. Monster attack.

01:14:05.125 --> 01:14:06.208
What have I done?

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:18.292
The game that lets you be a hero.

01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:19.500
I killed a monster!

01:14:19.583 --> 01:14:20.750
I killed two!

01:14:33.125 --> 01:14:34.458
Come on. Let's go.

01:14:34.542 --> 01:14:35.375
Help!

01:14:35.458 --> 01:14:37.000
Keep them moving.
Get everyone underground.

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:38.125
Yes, sir.

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:39.125
Bal?

01:14:39.792 --> 01:14:41.833
-Bal!
- Forget the kid. Let's go.

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:48.083
-Let's go!
-Come on!

01:14:51.458 --> 01:14:53.083
You've gotta be kidding me.

01:14:53.167 --> 01:14:56.167
Ma'am, someone is turning the cannon
into the kingdom.

01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:58.750
Yes, I know. I gave the order.

01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:01.792
But firing them
will take out half the city.

01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:04.125
Innocent people will die.

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:06.458
-And so will the monster.
-But--

01:15:10.917 --> 01:15:12.042
What are we doing?

01:16:04.625 --> 01:16:06.208
You don't belong here!

01:16:08.917 --> 01:16:10.583
I don't know what's scarier.

01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:16.417
The fact that everyone in this kingdom
wants to run a sword through my heart…

01:16:24.875 --> 01:16:26.250
or that sometimes…

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.208
I just wanna let 'em.

01:17:49.375 --> 01:17:50.458
I'm sorry.

01:17:54.292 --> 01:17:55.375
I'm sorry.

01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:00.917
I see you, Nimona.

01:18:05.958 --> 01:18:07.208
And you're not alone.

01:18:45.375 --> 01:18:46.583
Fire the cannons.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:48.833
Kill it.

01:18:50.417 --> 01:18:51.750
-I said fire the--
-No!

01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:54.500
It's over.

01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:58.958
It's fooling you. Fooling all of you!

01:18:59.542 --> 01:19:03.375
Can't you see this is what it wants?
For us to let our guard down!

01:19:04.542 --> 01:19:07.542
I see what it really is,
and so did Gloreth!

01:19:08.167 --> 01:19:10.792
That monster is a threat
to our very way of life!

01:19:10.875 --> 01:19:12.375
And what if we're wrong?

01:19:16.458 --> 01:19:19.000
What if we've always been wrong?

01:19:38.625 --> 01:19:39.458
No!

01:19:40.625 --> 01:19:41.458
No!

01:19:50.125 --> 01:19:51.125
Let's go!

01:19:51.833 --> 01:19:53.833
That gun's gonna kill everyone.

01:19:58.667 --> 01:19:59.500
Hey, boss.

01:20:00.833 --> 01:20:04.333
Be right back.
I'm gonna go break some stuff.

01:20:04.417 --> 01:20:07.500
-Wait, Nimona. What are you--
-It's time to rewrite this story.

01:20:07.583 --> 01:20:09.792
Nimona! Nimona!

01:20:25.458 --> 01:20:27.917
Go back to the shadows
from whence you came!

01:20:45.167 --> 01:20:46.167
Nimona!

01:20:48.542 --> 01:20:49.500
Nimona.

01:21:03.708 --> 01:21:04.792
Come back.

01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:09.833
Please come back.

01:22:17.958 --> 01:22:20.625
Some of us don't get
the happily ever after

01:22:20.708 --> 01:22:21.917
we were looking for.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.292
Maybe it's not that kind of kingdom.

01:22:29.042 --> 01:22:31.250
Or maybe it's not the end of the story.

01:22:35.958 --> 01:22:37.000
Over here, I'm free.

01:22:38.833 --> 01:22:40.167
-Uhh.
-Whoa.

01:24:39.083 --> 01:24:40.083
Hey, boss.
