00:02.600 --> 00:04.511
Previously, on Enterprise:

00:04.640 --> 00:08.235
We only want to be your partners,
to work together in common cause.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.631
Admiral Forrest has been killed.

00:13.760 --> 00:17.116
The DNA on the bomb's controls
was left by this woman, T'Pau.

00:17.240 --> 00:19.276
The answers you need are on Vulcan.

00:19.560 --> 00:23.075
And however far
you have to take this investigation...

00:23.480 --> 00:24.833
you have my support.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.871
This is a desert called the Forge.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.719
The route's the one
Surak supposedly followed.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.353
The guard recognised the person...

00:33.480 --> 00:35.391
who brought in the bomb
we found in the rubble.

00:35.520 --> 00:36.919
-T'Pau.
-No.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.389
It was you.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.675
What's a katra?

00:40.800 --> 00:43.917
Syrrannites claim
it's the essence of a Vulcan mind.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.634
That it can be transferred
from the body before death.

00:46.760 --> 00:49.320
V'Las was involved in the attack
on your embassy.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.273
He's responsible for
blaming it on the Syrrannites.

01:11.400 --> 01:15.075
Before we announce our decision,
is there anything you wish to say?

01:15.960 --> 01:17.552
My actions were taken...

01:18.200 --> 01:21.237
in the best interest of Vulcan
and the High Command.

01:21.480 --> 01:24.836
Keeping secrets from us
is in our best interest?

01:25.160 --> 01:27.799
Had I revealed my abilities
as a melder...

01:27.920 --> 01:30.559
my years of service would not
have been possible.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.875
Your accomplishments
have been noteworthy.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.797
They don't justify deception.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.639
Deception has never been a stranger
to this room.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.193
I caution you.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.151
One of our own members
was responsible...

01:42.280 --> 01:44.191
for bombing the Earth embassy.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.709
An act we tried to blame
on the Syrrannites.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.671
That assessment was correct.

01:49.120 --> 01:52.271
Our investigation of Stel has revealed
he is a Syrrannite.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.916
I find that difficult to accept.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.395
Numerous documents were discovered
in his home.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.317
The evidence is irrefutable.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.229
Syrrannites were responsible,
and they'll be dealt with accordingly.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.913
Regarding the matter at hand,
your position is terminated immediately.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.190
You're to surrender
all classified materials...

02:11.320 --> 02:13.788
to the Security Directorate
before leaving.

02:13.920 --> 02:18.118
I remind you
that your loyalty oath is still in effect.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.233
Violation of that oath--

02:20.360 --> 02:22.590
-I'm aware of the penalty.
-Good.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.750
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

02:27.520 --> 02:30.637
There's a great deal
that needs to be said, Excellency...

02:31.120 --> 02:33.076
but no one's willing to listen.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.274
It's been a long road

02:41.120 --> 02:42.917
Gettin' from there to here

02:43.040 --> 02:45.474
It's been a long time

02:46.800 --> 02:49.997
But my time is finally near

02:50.640 --> 02:53.552
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:54.880 --> 02:57.394
I will touch the sky

02:57.840 --> 03:01.549
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

03:01.760 --> 03:04.593
No, they're not gonna change my mind

03:05.040 --> 03:09.079
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

03:09.200 --> 03:12.317
I'm going where my heart will take me

03:12.440 --> 03:15.876
I've got faith to believe

03:16.760 --> 03:19.672
I can do anything

03:19.800 --> 03:23.713
I've got strength of the soul

03:24.160 --> 03:27.038
And no one's gonna bend or break me

03:27.160 --> 03:30.755
I can reach any star

03:32.560 --> 03:34.755
I've got faith

03:36.320 --> 03:39.039
I've got faith

03:39.800 --> 03:43.236
Faith of the heart

04:09.520 --> 04:12.034
-Who are you?
-I'm Jonathan Archer.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.391
Captain of the Earth vessel.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.278
And you must be T'Pol.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.711
You are a long way from Enterprise.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.912
I'm here to find the person who bombed
the Earth embassy.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.033
Her name is T'Pau.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.474
And she looks a hell of a lot like you.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.715
I am T'Pau.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.116
You murdered my friend,
along with 40 other people.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.358
I had nothing to do with
the destruction of your embassy.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.232
The evidence says you did.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.319
I haven't left this desert for two years.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.477
What does that tell you
about your evidence?

04:51.600 --> 04:53.556
It tells me that you're lying.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.072
You have a lot to learn
about Syrrannites.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.918
You have a lot to learn about humans.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.793
We don't sit back and do nothing
while our people are attacked.

05:00.920 --> 05:04.230
No, you traverse vast wastelands,
based on false information.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.155
What did you plan to do
when you found me?

05:10.720 --> 05:13.553
-Place me under arrest?
-Something like that.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.477
It seems everything I've heard
about your species is accurate.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.749
Mother.

05:20.520 --> 05:23.080
I'm pleased to see that you're all right.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.270
We have a great deal to talk about.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.595
Agreed.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.394
-You told them where to find us.
-Yes.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.277
-ls there anyone else with you?
-No.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.070
To have crossed the Forge
by yourselves...

05:37.200 --> 05:39.031
with the sand-fire storms
this time of year?

05:39.160 --> 05:42.038
We met a Syrrannite.
He helped us find shelter.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.958
Who was this person?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.513
His name was Arev.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.433
He was struck down
by an electrical charge.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.915
-He didn't make it.
-He's dead?

05:55.440 --> 05:57.510
Are you certain his name was Arev?

05:57.640 --> 05:59.312
That's what he told us.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.798
His true name was Syrran.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.753
He was our leader.

06:23.680 --> 06:27.434
-Captain, are you all right?
-I'm okay.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.391
Right before Arev died, he grabbed me.

06:35.640 --> 06:39.076
He put his hand on my forehead.
I felt something inside...

06:40.160 --> 06:41.354
my head.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.113
Do you think
he was trying to meld with you?

06:46.760 --> 06:48.193
I don't know.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.519
But ever since, I haven't been myself.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.957
You put us all in danger.
What if they've been followed?

07:04.160 --> 07:06.390
I only wanted her to know I was safe.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.193
You could have accomplished that
without revealing our location.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.151
I can't change what I've done.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.034
She doesn't deserve imprisonment.
I want her released.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.357
-Not until we've confirmed their story.
-My daughter wouldn't lie.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.436
She's not merely your daughter.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.553
She's a member of Starfleet...

07:21.680 --> 07:24.240
and Starfleet is allied
with the High Command.

07:24.480 --> 07:28.473
They'll both remain where they are
until I'm satisfied they can be trusted.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.155
Search patrols are flying day and night.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.475
They're the least of our worries now.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.678
If Syrran is dead...

07:40.920 --> 07:43.593
then everything we've worked for is lost.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.515
I can't believe they threw you out.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.676
Just because you helped us?

07:52.960 --> 07:54.154
I knew the risks.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.475
There's got to be some way
you can fight this.

07:56.600 --> 07:59.672
I could protest,
but it wouldn't accomplish anything.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.711
V'Las isn't one to change his mind.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.070
Who the hell put him in charge,
anyway?

08:04.200 --> 08:06.031
Our society rewards merit.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.028
V'Las has demonstrated
a singular talent for governing.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.877
What are you gonna do now?

08:15.000 --> 08:18.675
You're referring to my career?
I haven't given it much thought.

08:19.440 --> 08:22.557
There's something more important
we need to discuss.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.519
Have you made contact
with T'Pol or your Captain?

08:25.640 --> 08:28.154
We can't reach them
and they can't reach us.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.111
V'Las is determined
to wipe out the Syrrannites.

08:32.640 --> 08:36.679
He's particularly intent on destroying
their encampment in the Forge.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.155
Where the Captain and T'Pol
are headed.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.756
They may be in grave danger.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.756
You must have questions for me.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.438
I can't understand
how you could join these people.

09:11.640 --> 09:15.110
I'd been growing disillusioned
with Vulcan society for some time.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.919
When I was forced to resign
from the Academy...

09:19.920 --> 09:22.354
I began seriously to question my beliefs.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.470
And this is where you came
for answers?

09:29.760 --> 09:31.955
Syrrannites believe
that the Vulcans have strayed...

09:32.080 --> 09:33.877
from the teachings of Surak.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.993
Considering what the High Command
has done in recent years...

09:37.120 --> 09:41.079
the listening station at P'Jem,
suppression of dissent...

09:42.000 --> 09:44.468
our position isn't so hard to accept.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.558
You could have told me all this
when I came to visit.

09:48.680 --> 09:52.593
The High Command was just beginning
to hunt down suspected Syrrannites.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.996
I was afraid I would be next.
I wanted to keep you out of it.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.839
I know your marriage to Koss
was for my sake...

09:59.400 --> 10:01.038
to help me regain my post.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.355
I don't want your apologies, Mother.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.515
I want you to come back with me.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.399
I can't do that.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.477
When you gave me that map,
you knew I'd try to find you.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.957
I thought that if you could see
what we were trying to accomplish--

10:24.080 --> 10:25.559
That I'd understand?

10:27.320 --> 10:28.912
That I'd join you?

10:29.760 --> 10:32.035
I held out that hope, yes.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.073
-It's possible I was being foolish.
-Extremely.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.112
War is taking its toll.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.396
Vulcan is tearing itself apart.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.117
-Who are you?
-You know who I am, Captain.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.879
So much death.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.430
Hard to believe this will become known
as the Time of Awakening.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.792
That was 1,800 years ago.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.550
This doesn't feel like a dream.

11:47.680 --> 11:51.150
You're seeing the past through my eyes.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.309
Syrran did something to me
before he died.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.033
He chose you.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.230
You don't trust Vulcans, Captain.

12:05.680 --> 12:09.070
And, given your experiences with them,
I can't say I blame you.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.075
The culture you've come to know
isn't the one I helped to create.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.678
My people have strayed...

12:15.800 --> 12:18.951
and someone must restore them
to the path.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.797
You've got the wrong man.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.673
Sorry, Captain.
There's an Earth expression:

12:25.800 --> 12:27.791
"We're stuck with each other."

12:28.280 --> 12:30.635
Don't fight what's been given to you.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.836
Open your mind and your heart...

12:34.560 --> 12:36.391
and the way will become clear.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.918
Captain.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.599
We've pinpointed their location near
the northeastern border of the Forge.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.112
How accurate is this information?

13:00.240 --> 13:01.992
It's based on data
collected by search patrols.

13:02.120 --> 13:04.429
They've been conducting missions
for several days.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.551
We're going to bombard the camp...

13:08.160 --> 13:09.639
with photonic weapons.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.669
Our goal isn't
to exterminate these people.

13:12.800 --> 13:17.112
Our goal is to maintain order.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.352
They're in the deep desert.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.277
What possible harm could they do us?

13:21.400 --> 13:23.630
They've already destroyed an embassy.

13:24.080 --> 13:28.039
Eventually, they're going to have to
leave the Forge, and when they do...

13:28.160 --> 13:31.357
we can apprehend them
with little or no loss of life.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.309
It's very likely that Syrran himself
is inside the compound.

13:35.680 --> 13:39.355
With one decisive thrust,
we can cripple this insurgency...

13:39.480 --> 13:41.198
perhaps end it.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.269
We can't let an opportunity like this
pass us by.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.517
A surgical strike
could minimise the loss of life.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.076
The geomagnetic anomalies
make a precision attack impossible.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.956
This is the only way.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.235
We'll begin preparations immediately.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.749
This man, did he tell you his name?

14:05.080 --> 14:07.310
He seemed to think I knew who he was.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.155
Did you?

14:10.440 --> 14:11.793
It was Surak.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.193
We believe you.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.517
Syrran possessed the katra of Surak.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.756
Katras are nothing more than a myth.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.238
I used to think that...

14:23.160 --> 14:26.232
until I learnt to open up my mind
to other possibilities.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.794
If Syrran knew he was close to death...

14:29.120 --> 14:32.192
he would have tried to
transfer the katra to someone else.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.231
I was near him when he died.

14:35.600 --> 14:39.195
There is only one way to be certain.
I have to meld with you.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.912
I've had my fill of mind-melds.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.474
The prospect doesn't appeal to me
either.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.188
I've never melded with a human before.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.395
Your unchecked emotions will,
no doubt, prove distasteful.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.513
However, I ask your indulgence.

15:10.520 --> 15:13.318
My mind to your mind.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.354
My thoughts to your thoughts.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.073
Our minds are merging.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.150
-Our minds are one.
-Our minds are one.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.512
We're in the desert.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.958
There's a storm.

15:34.040 --> 15:37.191
We find refuge in a cave.

15:38.440 --> 15:40.078
Sand-lightning.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.071
Our minds are not alone.

15:43.840 --> 15:46.434
There's someone else here with us.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.958
I sense his presence.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.515
T'Pau?

15:57.480 --> 15:59.038
He has the katra.

16:04.520 --> 16:07.751
We can trigger a malfunction
in this satellite's imaging node.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.952
It'll take six minutes for the central
processor to correct the error.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.514
That should be enough time
to slip through the net.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.392
Won't they wonder
what caused the glitch?

16:15.520 --> 16:19.195
Errors occur frequently near the Forge.
It shouldn't raise suspicion.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.791
Mind if I ask you something?

16:24.920 --> 16:26.558
Why are you doing this?

16:27.400 --> 16:30.073
I never got the impression
you cared that much about humans.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.553
Seems like...

16:31.680 --> 16:34.638
you were always finding something new
to complain about.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.672
I lived on Earth
for more than 30 years, Commander.

16:38.280 --> 16:42.398
In that time, I developed an affinity
for your world and its people.

16:44.280 --> 16:46.589
You did a pretty good job of hiding it.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.115
Thank you.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.836
Launch Bay to Commander Tucker.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.989
Go ahead, Travis.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.311
We should be ready within the hour.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.759
What about helm control?

16:57.880 --> 17:00.155
I've rigged up
a stick and rudder system.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.750
It'll get us where we want to go,
but I can't promise a smooth ride.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.598
Just don't tell Malcolm about that part
until you're under way.

17:08.119 --> 17:12.590
Centuries ago, a set of katric arks were
discovered at the P'Jem monastery.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.233
-Katric arks?
-Polycrystalline vessels...

17:16.480 --> 17:20.598
allegedly used by ancient Vulcans
to preserve katras.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.593
They were scanned, analysed.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.517
One of the scientists even attempted
to meld with them.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.076
They found nothing
to indicate the presence of a katra.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.555
The Vulcan Science Academy
was just as sceptical about time travel.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.992
Do you really believe...

17:40.120 --> 17:43.351
you possess the living spirit of Surak
inside you?

17:44.000 --> 17:46.195
A man who died 1,800 years ago.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.716
Not when you put it like that.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.638
-There is a logical explanation.
-I'm listening.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.428
Syrran melded with you before he died.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.310
What you're experiencing
is the residue of his thoughts.

18:04.320 --> 18:08.199
So I'm suffering from
a mind-meld hangover?

18:09.040 --> 18:13.272
I wouldn't characterise it quite that way,
but essentially.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.279
It feels like...

18:17.760 --> 18:19.159
more than that.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.475
You have no basis for comparison.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.069
You've never undergone
a mind-meld before.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.430
Seeing Surak is only a part of it.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.036
I could swear I've been here before,
in this sanctuary.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.357
It's like coming back
to the house you grew up in.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.755
Syrran spent a great deal of time here.

18:39.040 --> 18:42.191
Let's say you're right,
and it was just a mind-meld.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.075
He still put something in my head.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.717
And I want it taken out.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.431
It may not be possible.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.514
What can we do for you?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.312
Where is your captain?

19:02.440 --> 19:05.238
He's indisposed at the moment.
Can I help you?

19:05.560 --> 19:09.075
The investigation of the embassy
bombing is nearly complete.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.472
You have a suspect?

19:11.680 --> 19:14.911
The evidence against him
and the Syrrannites is compelling.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.998
There's no longer any need
for your presence here.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.153
If it's all the same to you,
we'd like to stick around.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.113
We'd prefer you didn't.
This is an internal matter.

19:24.520 --> 19:28.354
We'll keep Starfleet apprised if there
are any subsequent developments.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.515
Excellency--

19:29.640 --> 19:32.518
Again, you have my deepest sympathy
for your loss.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.956
All of Vulcan grieves with you.

19:35.080 --> 19:37.719
With all respect, we aren't leaving.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.116
Not until we know
exactly what happened.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.196
I've also contacted Admiral Gardner.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.754
I'm sure you'll be hearing
from him soon.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.518
A pleasant journey.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.832
Son of a bitch hung up on us.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.791
Should I try to get him back?

19:54.080 --> 19:56.230
No one here has
ever performed this ritual.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.351
I've studied it for some time.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.831
I believe I can conduct it successfully.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.953
You'd not only be placing Surak's katra
in jeopardy, you could kill Archer.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.838
The risks are acceptable.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.113
I doubt Surak would agree.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.789
What alternative would you suggest?
That we follow this human?

20:13.600 --> 20:16.751
I believe your prejudice towards humans
is clouding your judgement.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.677
You questioning my logic?

20:22.240 --> 20:25.232
Syrran chose to place the katra
in Archer.

20:26.440 --> 20:29.876
He must have had his reasons,
even if we don't understand them.

20:30.240 --> 20:31.798
The reason is obvious.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.834
He was dying. Your daughter couldn't
reach him in time.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.757
He had to choose Archer.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.354
That may be.

20:39.040 --> 20:42.828
But we do have a choice.
Now, for the sake of everyone involved...

20:43.200 --> 20:45.077
I ask you to reconsider.

20:45.760 --> 20:49.070
I've made my decision.
I'll perform the procedure in one hour.

20:51.360 --> 20:52.998
And if Archer dies?

20:53.720 --> 20:57.156
I won't sacrifice our future
to protect the life of one human.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.394
You know...

21:11.200 --> 21:13.998
I'm the one
with a Vulcan ghost in his head...

21:14.560 --> 21:16.596
depending on who you believe.

21:18.480 --> 21:22.519
But I don't feel half as bad as you look.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.351
I'm considering our options.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.875
At least we know your mother's okay.

21:32.840 --> 21:36.799
She's joined a violent cult.
She's not okay.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.390
I don't think these people had anything
to do with the embassy.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.398
You sound convinced.

21:45.200 --> 21:48.317
Let's just say
it's more than a gut feeling.

21:54.680 --> 21:58.229
We've come to a decision.
The katra must be removed.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.553
I can't argue with that.

22:01.680 --> 22:04.319
There's a procedure, a ritual.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.234
It will transfer the katra
to another person.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.112
It's not without risk.

22:09.320 --> 22:13.029
Vulcan neurology is
exceptionally resilient, but a human's....

22:14.360 --> 22:18.319
The shock to your nervous system
will be severe. It could kill you.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.193
You must decline.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.631
We're not offering the choice.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.277
You'd do this by force?

22:26.480 --> 22:28.948
We'd prefer
that you undertake the ritual willingly.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.116
It will stand a better chance of success.

22:31.240 --> 22:34.789
However, if force is required,
we won't hesitate to use it.

22:39.720 --> 22:40.914
Let's get started.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.712
-Captain.
-It's my call.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.594
Admiral Gardner followed the Vulcan
line straight down the middle.

22:49.720 --> 22:50.914
He wants us out of here yesterday.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.837
Did you tell him
about the Captain and T'Pol?

22:52.960 --> 22:54.188
I left that part out.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.629
Enterprise was supposed to leave orbit
an hour ago.

22:56.760 --> 22:58.113
V'Las is not a patient man.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.629
There's not a whole lot
he can do about it.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.276
-Hell of a job, Travis.
-Thank you, sir.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.631
Just find them and bring them back.
No sightseeing along the way.

23:08.760 --> 23:09.988
Understood.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.430
We've got a recon satellite to jam.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.718
Enterprise hasn't left orbit.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.912
They're maintaining
a stationary position above the Forge.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.270
-Keep monitoring them.
-Yes, Excellency.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.229
We can't proceed with the operation
while the Earth ship is there.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.351
You're concerned about witnesses.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.836
Gardner gave them an order to leave.
I heard the transmission.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.869
So now we're monitoring
their communications?

23:34.000 --> 23:36.798
They wouldn't disobey an order
without a reason.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.831
I intend to find out what it is.

23:51.720 --> 23:55.872
Passed down through the ages,
the katra of Surak...

23:57.320 --> 23:59.390
father of all we hold true...

23:59.880 --> 24:01.996
Iives on in this man.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.830
Let it now live on in me.

24:54.480 --> 24:55.674
Surak.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.230
Good to see you again, Captain.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.790
My appearance must be
quite disconcerting. I apologise.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.198
Radiation sickness?

25:11.560 --> 25:14.438
We're paying a heavy price
for our foolishness.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.996
Logic has not won this day...

25:17.800 --> 25:20.553
but this day won't last forever.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.032
Logic is at the heart of every Vulcan.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.791
Even as the ashes fall,
my people are discovering a new way.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.318
You can accomplish
what Syrran could not.

25:33.880 --> 25:37.839
-But Syrran....
-Was a Vulcan...

25:38.560 --> 25:40.152
and you're human.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.510
Which means
you are untouched by a culture...

25:42.640 --> 25:45.632
that can no longer see
its own imminent destruction.

25:46.760 --> 25:51.197
I cannot let what happened to the
Vulcans of my time take place again.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.798
Find what my people have lost.

26:02.320 --> 26:05.437
Find the Kir'Shara.

26:11.080 --> 26:12.069
Captain.

26:13.800 --> 26:15.119
I failed.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.469
Surak chooses to remain where he is.

26:37.680 --> 26:41.514
The satellite's been disabled.
You've got six minutes to get through.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.392
Travis, it's all yours.

26:47.240 --> 26:50.118
Probably should have skipped breakfast
this morning.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.395
-They're through.
-We're losing contact.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.600
These thermals are
only going to get stronger.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.592
That was no thermal.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.317
The plasma-cannons are still working...

27:09.440 --> 27:11.556
but I can't say the same
for the targeting sensors.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.433
We must be getting close
to the geomagnetic field.

27:16.080 --> 27:19.629
-lt doesn't seem to be affecting them.
-They must have better shielding.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.957
I'll have to aim manually.
Can you get us on their tail?

27:33.240 --> 27:35.037
How are they still below us?

27:36.360 --> 27:39.352
-We've lost part of the starboard wing.
-We have to abort.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.073
I think I can get us down.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.316
You won't be able to get us back up.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.552
Thrusters are off-line.
We'll have to fire the chemical rockets.

27:46.680 --> 27:47.669
Hang on.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.358
They've been fired on.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.153
They took damage,
but they're heading back to Enterprise.

27:54.280 --> 27:57.511
-I guess six minutes wasn't enough.
-They must have been monitoring us.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.915
Three ships closing on our position.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.753
We're being hailed.
It's Administrator V'Las.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.792
Why did you launch a shuttlepod?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.433
Why the hell did you fire on it?

28:09.560 --> 28:12.313
You had no authorisation.
Answer the question.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.716
We're looking for our Captain.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.473
Archer's on the surface?

28:16.600 --> 28:19.672
He's in the Forge,
searching for the Syrrannites.

28:19.920 --> 28:22.115
You were ordered to leave orbit.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.158
I advised them to stay.

28:26.800 --> 28:30.759
I assume you assisted
in disabling the security satellite.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.072
I gave them the code.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.512
Commander Tucker...

28:38.760 --> 28:41.035
you're to break orbit immediately.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.390
We're not leaving without the Captain.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.590
You will leave immediately...

28:45.880 --> 28:48.997
or I'll order my ships to open fire.

29:07.560 --> 29:08.834
How is he?

29:11.440 --> 29:13.590
His breathing has stabilised...

29:15.000 --> 29:16.956
but his fever is still high.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.511
He agreed to the ritual.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.994
If he hadn't, you would have forced him.

29:29.240 --> 29:33.438
You claim that Surak's teachings have
been corrupted by the High Command...

29:33.560 --> 29:35.278
but you're no different.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.951
-There is a profound difference.
-You deceive yourself.

29:39.800 --> 29:40.869
T'Pol.

29:43.760 --> 29:46.513
I shouldn't have come here
looking for you.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.998
And I don't want anything more
to do with you.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.678
If that's your wish.

29:59.040 --> 30:02.032
-How long have I been out?
-More than three hours.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.279
I feel like...

30:05.280 --> 30:08.875
I just pulled my head
out of a plasma relay.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.199
You should rest.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.039
The Kir'Shara.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.197
What do you know about it?

30:29.480 --> 30:31.357
It was important to Surak.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.318
And it's in there.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.273
What's a Kir'Shara?

30:37.400 --> 30:40.039
An artefact. Syrran led us here to find it.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.508
If he knows where it is--

30:41.640 --> 30:45.349
Telescopes have sighted three Vulcan
cruisers in orbit over the Forge.

30:45.480 --> 30:46.959
The High Command knows we're here.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.913
We should evacuate immediately.
Give the order.

30:53.600 --> 30:54.999
I can find it.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.470
That one missed us by 20 metres.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.395
Tactical Alert. Polarise hull plating.

31:04.680 --> 31:07.240
How many warning shots
do Vulcans usually fire?

31:07.720 --> 31:08.789
None.

31:09.880 --> 31:10.949
V'Las.

31:13.760 --> 31:16.479
I'm running out of patience,
Commander.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.513
We've been over this.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.279
Our Captain and First Officer
are down there.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.994
We'll make sure they're returned to you.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.552
Break orbit. Now.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.751
You really think he'll do it?

31:32.360 --> 31:35.557
V'Las will do whatever it takes
to accomplish his goal.

31:38.080 --> 31:41.117
Vulcan and Earth have been allies
for a hundred years.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.435
Syrrannites must have
seen our ships by now.

31:43.560 --> 31:46.791
If they evacuate into the Forge,
they'll be extremely hard to track.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.751
We can't wait any longer.

31:50.160 --> 31:53.277
Drive Enterprise from orbit.
Use all necessary force.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.919
Yes, Excellency.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.511
Phase-cannons, return fire.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.789
The Vulcan ships are firing
on Enterprise.

32:09.640 --> 32:11.995
We could be next.
Take charge of the evacuation.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.190
We'll meet you on the Forge
as soon as we can.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.833
You can't stay here.

32:16.080 --> 32:18.071
I've spent two years
searching for the artefact.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.395
If there's a chance of finding it....

32:21.400 --> 32:22.469
T'Pol?

32:24.320 --> 32:25.594
I'm staying.

32:26.440 --> 32:27.429
Go.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.432
Re-route emergency power
to phase-cannons.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.118
Hull breach on C-Deck.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.112
They're reporting casualties.

32:53.240 --> 32:56.152
-V'Las is hailing, audio only.
-Put him through.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.393
You're hopelessly outgunned.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.478
Weapons are off-line, engines failing.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.955
Don't force me to destroy your ship.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.108
He's right. We should withdraw.

33:09.920 --> 33:12.753
Our deaths won't help
Captain Archer or T'Pol.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.632
Get us the hell out of here.

33:17.480 --> 33:20.278
The moment Enterprise is
beyond scanner range...

33:21.000 --> 33:23.195
begin bombardment of the compound.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.799
Yes, Excellency.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.275
T'Klaas.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.716
He was a student of Surak,
one of the first Kolinahr masters.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.872
There's no inscription...

34:04.600 --> 34:06.795
nothing to indicate his bloodline.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.751
How do you know his name?

34:10.679 --> 34:12.272
We're getting close.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.911
They've begun their assault.

34:25.639 --> 34:26.868
It's here.

35:12.040 --> 35:14.759
I had my doubts
whether it really existed.

35:18.600 --> 35:19.669
Let's go.

35:26.680 --> 35:27.829
This way.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.069
Report.

35:36.280 --> 35:39.272
Geomagnetic interference.
We can't get a target lock.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.640
Blanket the area.

36:35.080 --> 36:37.071
The sanctuary has been destroyed.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.633
Comb the desert.

36:39.400 --> 36:42.073
-Make sure there are no survivors.
-Affirmative.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.077
You're presiding over a massacre.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.953
We are eliminating a threat.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.073
Are you all right?

36:54.640 --> 36:55.755
I'm fine.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.552
We should keep moving.

37:08.880 --> 37:09.995
Captain.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.196
I was afraid you were still inside.

37:38.440 --> 37:39.793
It's all right.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.072
We found the Kir'Shara.

37:46.680 --> 37:49.717
You have always struggled so
with your emotions.

37:50.680 --> 37:51.999
I came here....

37:52.840 --> 37:54.751
I did all this to help you.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.158
I don't understand.

37:59.800 --> 38:00.915
You will.

38:04.400 --> 38:05.594
Mother....

38:09.200 --> 38:13.113
I've always been so proud of you,
my T'Pol.

38:21.480 --> 38:22.595
Mother.

38:37.840 --> 38:40.149
I understand we suffered casualties.

38:40.280 --> 38:43.192
Injuries, two of them serious.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.837
I share your concern about
Captain Archer and T'Pol.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.951
They've been in tough jams before.

38:50.960 --> 38:54.077
What does the High Command have
against the Syrrannites?

38:54.200 --> 38:56.953
They went to a lot of trouble to
frame them for the embassy bombing.

38:57.080 --> 39:00.914
The Syrrannites believe violence
to be antithetical to Surak's teachings.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.153
So they're pacifists.

39:03.880 --> 39:07.839
V'Las considers that
a dangerous mindset. Particularly now.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.552
What do you mean?

39:10.240 --> 39:13.118
The High Command is planning
to attack Andoria.

39:13.680 --> 39:14.874
Wait, wait.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.276
Vulcan and Andoria signed
a peace treaty two years ago.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.756
Captain Archer helped negotiate it.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.429
Vulcan intelligence claims the
Andorians are developing a weapon...

39:24.560 --> 39:26.869
possibly based on Xindi technology.

39:27.440 --> 39:28.509
You don't believe it.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.950
I suspect V'Las is using the claim
to advance an agenda.

39:32.440 --> 39:35.876
He's persuaded the High Command
to launch a preemptive strike.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.036
He's going to start an interstellar war.

39:38.160 --> 39:41.118
One that could devastate
Andoria and Vulcan...

39:41.320 --> 39:45.279
and eventually involve other worlds,
including Earth.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.074
-Set a course for Andoria.
-Andoria?

39:54.360 --> 39:55.713
Maximum warp.

39:56.305 --> 40:02.919
