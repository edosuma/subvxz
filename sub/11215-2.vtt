00:31.799 --> 00:32.766
Previously on Southland:

00:32.800 --> 00:33.801
Hey, Larry.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.369
(gun firing)

00:35.403 --> 00:37.471
You said I could work alone
until Russ gets back.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.240
We're not sure Russ
is coming back.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.241
He's coming back.

00:40.274 --> 00:43.211
(crowd shouting)

00:43.244 --> 00:44.378
Get off! Get
off! Get off!

00:44.412 --> 00:45.413
Get off!

00:45.446 --> 00:46.780
Stay back! Stay back!

00:46.814 --> 00:48.316
Stay back. We're good.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.319
No, Sam.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.489
Get away from me!

00:55.523 --> 00:57.158
You think I wouldn't find out?

00:57.191 --> 00:59.193
Why are you drinking, huh?
You think I'm stupid?

00:59.227 --> 01:01.129
I hate you!
Don't run away
from me!

01:01.129 --> 01:03.131
I have to stop
what I'm doing,

01:03.164 --> 01:05.433
which is freaking important,
by the way,

01:05.466 --> 01:07.135
and explain it to you?

01:07.135 --> 01:08.236
I'm sorry.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.405
(crowd shouting)

01:11.439 --> 01:12.606
Back the fuck up!

01:12.640 --> 01:14.175
Do I look like her?

01:14.208 --> 01:15.243
You're beautiful,

01:15.276 --> 01:16.577
just the way she was.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.745
I want to find her.

01:17.778 --> 01:18.879
We can try.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.148
We can fold in
your homicide.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.715
Hell, yeah, man.
Yeah?

01:21.749 --> 01:23.351
Yeah.
I mean, you know,
that's, of course,

01:23.384 --> 01:25.286
you know, if Big Papa
over here says it's okay

01:25.319 --> 01:26.787
to come run
with the big dogs.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.489
It's pharmaceuticals,
right?

01:35.163 --> 01:36.630
Get out of here.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.367
I just miss you.

01:42.236 --> 01:45.173
(siren wailing)

01:45.173 --> 01:47.175
Come on, come on.
Where'd you go?

01:47.175 --> 01:48.776
Where'd you go?

01:48.809 --> 01:50.844
Got him.
I got him-- 3:00.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.193
(tires screeching)

02:12.966 --> 02:14.202
(siren shuts off)

02:16.337 --> 02:17.505
(men screaming)

02:18.606 --> 02:19.873
The gas tank's leaking!

02:22.943 --> 02:24.545
Loosen your
seat belt!

02:24.578 --> 02:25.779
Let's go!
Let's go!

02:25.813 --> 02:27.681
Let's go! Let's go!

02:32.320 --> 02:35.756
MAN:
Officer John Cooper knows,
and Ben Sherman will learn

02:35.789 --> 02:39.860
that sometimes you see things
as a cop nobody should see.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.563
TAMMI:
I don't mind.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.932
I'll make you some eggs, baby.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.236
SAMMY:
I'll grab something
downtown.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.438
Okay.
Know what
you could do?

02:50.471 --> 02:51.939
Go to Box Club.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.641
We're out
of toilet paper.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.876
Can't I just go to Walgreen's?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.281
No, Tammi.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.516
We need to be fiscally
responsible now.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.917
We need to grow
as a couple.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.287
Just, I got a lot
of work to do.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.688
Yeah, what?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.757
For my portfolio.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.393
I told you, I have to finish
Photoshopping my images

03:12.426 --> 03:13.927
before I take them
to the printer.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.796
(laughing):
Yeah, your images.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.398
Sammy!

03:18.966 --> 03:20.934
Please, this
is important to me.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.936
I'd do it, but who
knows how long

03:22.970 --> 03:24.638
I'm going to be
on this stakeout?

03:24.672 --> 03:27.641
You know, I'd
give my right arm

03:27.675 --> 03:30.278
just to be going
to Box Club

03:30.278 --> 03:32.913
instead of sitting on
my ass at a stakeout.

03:32.946 --> 03:36.517
Well, I need to get
into a good gallery

03:36.550 --> 03:40.788
before I'm stuck out here
taking care of our kid.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.456
You'll need this.
(groans)

03:42.490 --> 03:45.293
I hear the frozen burrito
dinners are fantastic.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.295
(dog whimpering)

03:48.729 --> 03:50.564
(groans)

03:50.598 --> 03:52.866
Bye.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.303
BEN:
It's just up here
on the right.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.904
JOHN:
Nice digs, huh?

03:58.038 --> 03:59.640
MAN:
Over here.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.309
Here.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.749
(man coughing)

04:08.782 --> 04:09.883
What happened?

04:09.917 --> 04:10.918
I don't know.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.320
I looked out my window,

04:12.320 --> 04:13.954
and I saw Rich crawling
out his door.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.656
We need an ambulance.
JOHN:
It's on the way.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.824
Is anyone in there?

04:16.857 --> 04:18.058
Did you see
anybody come out?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.660
Look, I was too afraid
to go in.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.929
I think his wife
might be hurt, too.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.031
A-43. Requesting
two additional units.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.032
Excuse me, sir?
Man down.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.400
Victim of an ADW.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.001
Can you tell us
what happened?

04:28.035 --> 04:29.570
(coughing)
MAN:
He's in pretty
bad shape.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.804
All right, you
stay with him

04:30.838 --> 04:31.805
till the
paramedics arrive.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.441
Uh, okay.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.476
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:42.450 --> 04:44.385
(creaking)

05:56.156 --> 05:58.426
(water running)

06:27.555 --> 06:29.490
(breathing heavily)

06:48.008 --> 06:49.943
(creaking)

07:16.770 --> 07:18.739
Downstairs and basement
are clear.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.808
We've got a unit
clearing the yard.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.910
All right.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.111
Let's get our perimeter
set up.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.946
Roger.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.719
JOHN:
We got a real mess.

07:33.186 --> 07:36.089
Yeah, we need some homicide
detectives out here.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.992
We've already radioed for
an additional RA unit.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.529
Mariella really wants you
to come by

07:41.562 --> 07:42.930
and meet
the baby tomorrow.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.932
You mean my sister?

07:44.965 --> 07:47.100
What, so you're mad
at me?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.602
I'm late, okay?

07:48.636 --> 07:50.003
Hold on a second.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.872
Just tell me...
tell me what's going on.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.941
You were supposed
to help me find my mom.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.610
Have you even tried?

07:56.644 --> 07:58.178
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.113
No excuses.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.782
I will.

08:02.883 --> 08:03.984
I will.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.056
Just come early, okay?

08:09.089 --> 08:11.024
Your sister is a beauty.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.137
(indistinct radio transmission)

08:27.741 --> 08:29.677
This is Detective Cordero.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.911
What do we have?

08:30.944 --> 08:32.179
JOHN:
Adult female
downstairs.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.081
Two younger females
dead upstairs.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.583
House is ransacked.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.184
There's no sign
of forced entry.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.786
Looks like the father
walked in on it.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.588
You talk to him?
No, he was
out of it.

08:40.588 --> 08:41.789
Took him over
to Saint Ambrose.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.056
He's a doctor there.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.025
Well, let's
have a look.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.827
It's a bad one.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.067
(sighs)

08:58.071 --> 09:00.741
Concentrate on the
marks on her neck.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.110
Make sure you leave
that knot intact.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.112
The way it's tied could
tell us something

09:05.145 --> 09:06.947
later down
the line.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.816
Dust over here
for prints.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.952
Looks like he had her
over here at some point.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.088
And we got to swab
these beer cans.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.059
We got a lot of
work to do here.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.700
(siren blaring)

09:26.734 --> 09:29.036
Get a shot here
where someone stepped in blood.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.072
Cut out that patch of rug
when he's done, okay?

09:32.105 --> 09:35.242
Also, get a print
on all these items.

09:35.275 --> 09:38.078
Somebody rifled her
purse and tossed it.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.814
(phone ringing)

09:40.848 --> 09:42.650
Quiet. Quiet.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.652
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.654
(phone continues ringing)

09:52.292 --> 09:54.194
(phone continues ringing)

09:54.227 --> 09:55.796
(phone stops ringing)

09:55.829 --> 09:57.831
Hello?

09:57.865 --> 09:59.933
No, this isn't Dr. Ryerson.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.635
May I ask who's calling?

10:04.237 --> 10:06.239
Okay.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.142
Mm-hmm.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.178
Well, that's very
nice, Mrs. Kern.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.213
I'll be sure and
pass that along.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.715
Bye, now.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.183
What was that?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.151
This must be Ryerson's phone.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.854
That was one of his patients
returning his call.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.923
Mrs. Kern,
92 years old.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.357
He just put in a stent,

10:24.391 --> 10:27.194
and he's been checking in on her
every day since.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.431
How is everything
going out there?

10:31.464 --> 10:34.267
Uh, none of the neighbors
have any video surveillance

10:34.301 --> 10:35.969
that includes the street.

10:36.003 --> 10:40.040
Uh, we got a boy who
thinks he saw a van.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.676
He's not sure the make
or the color.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.078
You know, um, we're okay here.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.680
You two get going.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.921
(helicopter passing overhead)

10:53.954 --> 10:55.088
So, that's it?

10:55.122 --> 10:56.790
Just walk away?

10:56.824 --> 10:58.792
No cars in the field.
We gotta get back out.

10:58.826 --> 11:01.128
Chase the radio?

11:02.229 --> 11:04.131
Get in.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.168
(siren chirping)

11:11.104 --> 11:13.073
Look.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.076
She cut us a break, letting us
get out of there.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.845
This is a rough one.

11:19.412 --> 11:22.349
Believe me, I want somebody
to pay as much as you.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.385
(engine starting)

11:31.258 --> 11:34.227
The girls barely had time
to get the ice cream open.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.963
He came right
on top of them.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.230
They.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.999
There had to be at least
two assailants,

11:39.032 --> 11:40.834
the way those girls
were killed.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.837
They came to the house,
rang the doorbell.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.072
One of the girls answered.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.506
Maybe they talked
their way in.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.908
Pushed their way in.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.476
Must've been
a commotion,

11:49.509 --> 11:51.378
because the mother
came out.
And they killed her.

11:51.411 --> 11:55.182
And the girls.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.850
a little snack.
Half-eaten.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.318
Must've heard
the father come home.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.387
Because they hit him out there
and dragged him in.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.189
That would be the time line.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.957
It could've been a follow home
from the convenience store.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.425
Pretty woman.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.427
Nice car.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.162
Maybe.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.197
What are you thinking,

12:10.230 --> 12:11.398
somebody on the inside?

12:11.431 --> 12:12.465
The pool man, the gardener?

12:12.499 --> 12:14.001
Didn't it strike you at all

12:14.034 --> 12:15.335
that the husband was the
only one that survived?

12:15.368 --> 12:16.436
We don't know that for sure.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.105
The guy's still in surgery.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.439
In my experience,
it's usually the husband,

12:19.472 --> 12:21.274
and statistics bear that out.

12:21.308 --> 12:24.144
This isn't some joker who
stabbed himself with a penknife

12:24.177 --> 12:25.278
just to make it look good.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.814
This guy was savagely attacked.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.048
I know it's hard for you
to wrap your mind

12:28.081 --> 12:29.382
around a father
doing something

12:29.416 --> 12:31.985
like this, especially
to his daughters,

12:32.019 --> 12:33.987
but I've seen it.

12:34.021 --> 12:36.990
The more you sweat here the less
you'll bleed on the street.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.026
True that, true that.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.061
Uh, we do for you
what you can't do

12:41.094 --> 12:42.362
for yourself.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.897
That's poetry, man.
Believe that.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.098
Yeah, I thought so.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.166
Thanks.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.201
Okay, let's pay attention, kids.

12:48.235 --> 12:51.038
Now, we're set up over at Trini
day spot, Platinum Motors.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.072
Now, we're looking for drugs,

12:52.105 --> 12:53.040
weapons, cash.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.441
We get anything,

12:54.474 --> 12:57.210
I want to set up a chase car
about a block away.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.511
You guys handle that?
We'll be on the roof.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.213
No problem.
Cameras?

13:00.247 --> 13:01.248
Yes! Cameras.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.016
Binoculars.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.952
We can even get an airship
to fly over and do some aerial.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.386
Good, good,
good call.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.221
All right? Now, let's
get this guy, man.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.090
Hey.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.092
You mind?
Oh...

13:12.125 --> 13:14.194
Take it easy, all right?

13:14.227 --> 13:16.296
Don't tell me to take
it easy, okay?

13:16.329 --> 13:18.331
Come on, Sal, he didn't mean
anything by it.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.301
Don't need you to translate
for me, Moretta.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.040
Oye.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.909
Como que el sabia
que Mario Ramos trabajaba

13:28.942 --> 13:30.143
por ustedes
tan rapido?

13:30.177 --> 13:32.145
Lo mato el mismo dia
que hablamos.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.147
El mismo dia.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.449
Quizas la rata
esta aqui.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.452
LYDIA:
There's the Mercedes wagon.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.021
RENE:
They have no clue.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.255
Yeah.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.924
It's where kids
are involved,

13:43.957 --> 13:46.493
you just... can never
get used to it.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.163
There go the girls.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.132
Entering the store.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.537
There's the bag
with the ice cream.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.146
That guy that got out
of the pickup truck.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.514
What is that
he's buying?

14:07.547 --> 14:08.916
Is that beer?

14:08.916 --> 14:11.051
I can't get

14:11.084 --> 14:12.219
a good look at
the driver.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.221
He's a big one though.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.488
Fat man

14:15.522 --> 14:17.424
and little boy.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.297
Wait, stop,

14:24.331 --> 14:25.598
stop it, stop it.

14:25.632 --> 14:27.267
I think I can see
the plate.

14:27.300 --> 14:31.271
One, Edward,
Four, Nine...

14:31.304 --> 14:33.240
"O," eight?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.945
Let's get an APB out
on this truck right away.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.110
WOMAN (over radio):
...with those patrol cars.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.578
ANNOUNCER:
Absolutely. We appreciate
your call.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.246
Richard, you're calling.
Where you from, Richard?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.215
RICHARD:
Uh, this is Richard, yeah...

15:28.395 --> 15:29.696
That address we got
off the partial plate

15:29.729 --> 15:30.697
on the pickup truck
came up dry.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.065
Mr. Wayne Dorff
has moved,

15:32.099 --> 15:33.733
no forwarding address.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.003
Yeah, well, his parole officer
is on his way here now

15:36.003 --> 15:37.637
with some updated
information.

15:37.670 --> 15:41.008
You rousted that poor man out
of bed at 6:00 in the morning?

15:41.008 --> 15:42.475
Triple homicide
last I looked.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.311
What's the deal with the
skinny one on the tape?

15:44.344 --> 15:46.013
He's one lucky bastard.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.181
Wayne Dorff's prints were
all over that house,

15:48.215 --> 15:50.050
but they couldn't pull
one decent print

15:50.083 --> 15:51.751
on the skinny one.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.021
Yeah, and they can't get a
decent picture of him either.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.288
This is the best they could do.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.459
The little scumbag
is sleeping late.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.428
Yeah, and that's why
we'll catch him.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.365
What's all that?
Possible motive.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.634
Ryerson's financials
from public record.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.337
He's in foreclosure on a medical
building in Pasadena.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.172
The whole country's
in foreclosure.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.441
Check and see what type of life
insurance he has on his wife.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.475
So what's this?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.044
I say black, you say white?

16:17.077 --> 16:18.545
Why are you trying to
change the subject?

16:18.578 --> 16:19.712
I thought we were
solving a case here.

16:19.746 --> 16:20.747
No, you're just
busting my balls

16:20.780 --> 16:22.615
because I'm not Russell.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.284
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.485
No, I'm not!

16:25.518 --> 16:27.487
(indistinct radio transmission)

16:27.520 --> 16:29.456
Get any sleep?

16:31.291 --> 16:33.226
I'll be all right.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.464
Can't have a partner
that's nodding off.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.266
Can't sleep, I'll give you
a couple Ambiens.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.634
Yeah, I don't need
any of your pills.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.773
Those pills I take
are for back pain.

16:46.806 --> 16:48.741
And this passive-aggression
bullshit of yours

16:48.775 --> 16:50.277
ain't gonna fly.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.380
You got something to say to me,
you just say it.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.222
(camera shutter clicking)

17:02.255 --> 17:04.624
Got another Escalade.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.527
And... no plates.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.529
No plates?

17:09.562 --> 17:10.797
I need the plates, bro.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.465
Why you tell me you
got an Escalade?

17:12.499 --> 17:14.467
You got not plates.
(laughs)

17:14.501 --> 17:16.769
It's like saying you cuff
somebody with no cuffs.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.638
(laughing)

17:18.671 --> 17:20.673
You take over.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.675
Hold this.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.578
Thanks.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.247
You pregnant yet, Sammy?

17:27.280 --> 17:28.781
What?

17:28.815 --> 17:31.551
You and your wife, you said
you were trying, right?

17:31.584 --> 17:33.553
(sighs):
Yeah, we're still trying.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.787
Ah!

17:34.821 --> 17:36.723
I know you are, you
horny bastard!

17:36.756 --> 17:38.691
Keep trying!
How old is she?

17:39.792 --> 17:41.128
She's young.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.529
Young, huh?

17:42.562 --> 17:44.131
You know what they say
about the young ones.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.665
They're fertile.

17:45.698 --> 17:49.136
So, if you're still trying
something must be wrong.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.470
She must not want
it, you know?

17:50.503 --> 17:51.738
Psychological block
or something

17:51.771 --> 17:52.772
going on right there.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.407
Gotta bust through it.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.742
Yeah.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.577
Hey, Sammy, come over here
for a second.

17:59.679 --> 18:02.615
Isn't this that kid Orlando
we busted last year?

18:04.284 --> 18:06.219
Orlando?
Yeah.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.456
Yeah, right
down there.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.165
Yes, it is.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.439
He's on probation.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.908
We can pop him right now
for gang association.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.543
Get him to roll.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.711
Let's do it.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.380
Let's do it.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.514
Hey, watch your
step, ladies.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.316
Florencia called the Ripper.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.585
Real name Orlando, just left
the building in a green Cougar.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.187
Try to pull him over.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.854
Call me on my cell,
we're on our way.

18:41.888 --> 18:42.855
Yep.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.262
There his is! Go!
There! There! There!

18:55.802 --> 18:57.870
To the right, to the right,
to the right.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.440
All right, where are
you, little bastard?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.708
There he is!
There he is!

19:01.741 --> 19:03.276
There he is! There he is!
Back up, back up!

19:03.310 --> 19:05.712
I got it, I got it.
Back up, back up, back up.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.380
(tires squealing)

19:07.414 --> 19:09.682
Hold up!
(grunts)

19:09.716 --> 19:11.551
All right, here we go.

19:11.584 --> 19:12.785
(chuckling)

19:12.819 --> 19:15.222
(horn honking)
No, no, no, no, no, no!

19:15.255 --> 19:16.923
Come on, guys!
All right, all right,
all right.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.358
Calm down.
Hey, hey.
God!

19:18.391 --> 19:21.328
LYDIA:
How well do you know
Dr. Ryerson?

19:21.361 --> 19:22.795
MAN:
He's a good surgeon.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.664
LYDIA:
Well, still,
his records show

19:24.697 --> 19:26.966
that he lost an expensive
malpractice suit

19:26.999 --> 19:28.668
earlier this year,

19:28.701 --> 19:30.237
death of a
ten-year-old boy.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.239
MAN:
We've all lost patients,
Detective.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.840
LYDIA:
Did you know Mrs. Ryerson?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.742
And what kind of a marriage
did they have?

19:35.775 --> 19:37.744
Happy, I think.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.680
He keeps asking
about her.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.682
Of course, we haven't
told him anything yet.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.351
Thanks for that.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.319
He's still a little
out of it.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.595
Dr. Ryerson?

19:55.628 --> 19:58.565
I'm Detective
Adams, LAPD.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.801
Hello.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.337
I'm going to need to ask
you some questions

20:04.371 --> 20:06.339
about what happened at
your house yesterday.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.308
(groans)

20:09.809 --> 20:11.611
I don't know.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.614
I went in the house
and, uh...

20:14.647 --> 20:16.583
(clears throat)
I don't know.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.620
They said that
somebody, uh, hit me.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.589
That I've had an operation.

20:24.657 --> 20:27.560
You don't remember
anything else?

20:29.329 --> 20:31.764
I think I saw my wife.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.032
Where is she?

20:33.065 --> 20:36.035
They won't let me
talk to her.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.004
Your wife was killed.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.710
What?

20:43.743 --> 20:46.446
She was killed in the
attack at your house.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.014
(sobbing)

20:48.047 --> 20:49.982
God, no, Abby.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.423
No.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.924
Do you have any
idea who might

20:57.957 --> 20:59.559
have done something
like this?

20:59.592 --> 21:01.794
No.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.936
Oh, my God.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.938
Where are the girls?

21:11.971 --> 21:13.606
Do the girls know?

21:13.640 --> 21:17.344
Your daughters were killed, too.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.612
I'm so sorry.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.581
(sobbing):
No.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.585
Oh, God, no.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.659
I'm sorry.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.631
A guys shouldn't be
ragging me

21:38.665 --> 21:39.866
about my sex life--
it's private.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.868
Come on, bro, I was just
passing the time.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.737
Isn't this that kid, Orlando,
we busted last year?

21:48.741 --> 21:50.042
Stop!

21:51.644 --> 21:53.380
Stop running, Orlando!

21:56.716 --> 21:57.684
Whoa.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.862
(woman whimpers)

22:09.896 --> 22:11.398
You okay? Yeah?

22:20.106 --> 22:22.775
(grunting and groaning)

22:22.809 --> 22:24.411
What was that, huh?

22:24.411 --> 22:26.045
Was that a gun?
No, ese.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.814
Did you just throw
a gun, Orlando?

22:27.847 --> 22:29.416
No, ese.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.883
Huh?

22:35.054 --> 22:36.623
RENE:
Hey, Lydia.

22:36.656 --> 22:37.824
Hold up.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.559
Maybe you were right
about this guy.

22:39.592 --> 22:40.827
Who?
Ryerson.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.562
The guy was beaten

22:42.595 --> 22:45.798
to within an inch of
his life, Russell.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.434
And you should
have seen him

22:47.434 --> 22:49.769
when I told him
about his wife and kids.

22:51.438 --> 22:52.905
They weren't even supposed
to be there.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.774
They were supposed
to be in Big Bear

22:54.807 --> 22:58.177
with family and friends,
but the trip was canceled

22:58.210 --> 22:59.712
'cause someone got the flu.

22:59.746 --> 23:02.549
Well, first of all,
I'm not Russell.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.851
Sorry.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.853
But we need to
check the parents

23:06.886 --> 23:08.187
from the malpractice suit.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.857
Could be revenge for
the death of their son.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.559
Maybe, but what
you just said

23:12.592 --> 23:14.761
about the girls were
supposed to be gone--

23:14.794 --> 23:16.863
doesn't that
strike you?

23:16.896 --> 23:19.666
Of course,
I know how it sounds.

23:19.699 --> 23:20.800
What is this?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.602
I say black
and you say white?

23:22.635 --> 23:24.837
Well... touchГ©.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.005
But what would
you say

23:26.038 --> 23:27.707
if I told you
that the doctor

23:27.740 --> 23:28.875
might have known Wayne Dorff?

23:28.908 --> 23:30.076
How?

23:30.109 --> 23:31.844
Because that's
what I found out

23:31.878 --> 23:33.513
digging through the doctor's
cell phone records.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.881
Calls to Wayne Dorff?

23:34.914 --> 23:38.017
No, but calls to the rehab
center on La Mirada.

23:38.050 --> 23:41.821
Town of 9.8 million--
that's some coincidence.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.625
MAN:
He's one of our doctors.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.126
Been coming here
two Saturdays a month

23:47.159 --> 23:49.662
the four years I've
been director.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.764
Did Doctor Ryerson
have any dealings

23:51.798 --> 23:54.033
with one of your
clients, Wayne Dorff?

23:55.935 --> 23:58.738
Oh, don't tell me Dorff had
something to do with this.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.139
Did they know
each other?

24:00.172 --> 24:01.908
(sighs)

24:01.941 --> 24:03.776
He had a terrible
staph infection,

24:03.810 --> 24:05.645
and the doctor
cured him.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.246
Big, fat slob.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.816
He was always hitting
the doctor up for a 20,

24:09.849 --> 24:11.618
and this
is the thanks he gets?

24:11.651 --> 24:13.152
We actually
want to talk

24:13.185 --> 24:15.187
to one of Mr. Dorff's
associates.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.789
A skinny guy,

24:16.823 --> 24:18.825
five-eight,
Caucasian.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.126
Danny Sutton.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.761
Bad news.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.897
We used to call them
Sylvester and Tweety Bird.

24:24.931 --> 24:29.101
I'm sure it was Danny
got Wayne using again.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.202
Well, thank you.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.871
If we have any
more questions,

24:31.904 --> 24:33.039
we'll give you a call?
Sure.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.774
Thank you.

24:35.842 --> 24:38.144
So, they saw
the Armani suits,

24:38.177 --> 24:39.679
the cash,
the Mercedes,

24:39.712 --> 24:41.814
and decided to go
for the big score,

24:41.848 --> 24:43.783
and it all went bad.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.218
The mounting financial debt,
insurance...

24:46.252 --> 24:48.688
I still say he could
have hired Dumb and Dumber

24:48.721 --> 24:49.789
to do the wife in.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.223
I'm not ruling
anybody out.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.925
Either way,

24:52.959 --> 24:55.227
they knew where he lived,
so it wasn't a follow home.

24:55.261 --> 24:56.663
Let's run Sutton's priors

24:56.696 --> 24:59.065
and get some units out
looking for him.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.801
Hey, look, about before,

25:01.834 --> 25:04.303
I didn't mean to insult you.
(phone ringing)

25:04.336 --> 25:06.005
I already forgot
about it.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.940
Cooper.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.979
We're on our way.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.614
What's up?
Watch commander.

25:14.647 --> 25:15.848
We're going to do
a follow-up

25:15.882 --> 25:18.785
for the detectives
on the triple homicide.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.822
(phone ringing)

25:22.855 --> 25:24.857
Hey, look,
I can't talk right now.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.693
I'll be there. I promise.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.828
(sighs)
That was my sister.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.963
She's hell-bent
on fixing me up.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.265
Get laid, get drunk.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.034
Try and forget
about this crap.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.836
Yeah.

25:50.182 --> 25:51.751
(sighs)

25:53.653 --> 25:54.887
(grunting)

25:59.626 --> 26:00.893
Oh, God.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.841
Hey, do you need
any help with that?

26:14.874 --> 26:15.908
Ah, I'm great.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.109
I'm good.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.945
Awesome.

26:25.918 --> 26:26.919
Right there.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.354
Right there,
right?

26:28.387 --> 26:30.256
All you got to do

26:30.289 --> 26:32.258
is give us
a little information, bro.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.893
No way.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.829
Big mistake, Orlando.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.831
So... you trust this Gil guy?

26:38.865 --> 26:39.966
Yeah, man.

26:39.999 --> 26:40.967
I trust him.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.234
Why shouldn't I?

26:42.268 --> 26:43.803
(spits)

26:43.836 --> 26:45.271
I don't know.

26:45.304 --> 26:46.806
Sal hates him.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.742
Sal hates everybody.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.744
How does Mercedes feel
about the baby?

26:52.845 --> 26:54.413
Not too good, man.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.148
She's mad at me.

26:56.182 --> 26:57.684
You know,
I promised her

26:57.717 --> 26:59.819
I'd help her find her mom,
but I got too busy

26:59.852 --> 27:00.987
with Valentina,
you know?

27:01.020 --> 27:02.388
(speaks Spanish)

27:02.421 --> 27:04.256
Tell us about Trinny Day,
we'll cut you loose.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.391
No way.
SAMMY:
Huh?

27:05.424 --> 27:07.293
No way.

27:07.326 --> 27:08.961
How about you, bro?

27:08.995 --> 27:10.863
Sure you're ready for a baby?

27:10.897 --> 27:12.699
Ooh!
It's pretty brutal.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.105
What have we got there?

27:22.441 --> 27:24.744
So, you want that lawyer?
Yeah.

27:25.845 --> 27:26.946
Big mistake, vato.

27:32.919 --> 27:34.821
May I see your
Box Club Card, please?

27:34.854 --> 27:36.388
(mouth full):
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.229
Are you
Samuel Bryant?

27:43.262 --> 27:44.931
I'm Tammi Bryant.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.265
I'm sorry-- I can't
accept his card.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.202
I am Mrs. Samuel Bryant.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.071
You need to have
your own card.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.339
What? Why?

27:53.372 --> 27:54.941
Because those
are the rules.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.375
But you can get one
at customer service.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.745
But I have waited in line
a really long time.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.112
It's $50 to join.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.380
Well, I don't have $50.

28:01.413 --> 28:02.915
We accept American
Express now.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.316
This is ridiculous.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.385
Lady, why don't you
just go get a new card!

28:06.418 --> 28:08.254
No, no, this is how
they get you, man.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.890
Look, why can't I just
use my husband's card?

28:10.923 --> 28:12.091
Come on, this is BS.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.392
Please.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.927
Ma'am, please don't
swear at me.

28:14.961 --> 28:15.962
Oh, oh, oh, swearing?

28:15.995 --> 28:17.196
You call that swearing?

28:17.229 --> 28:19.365
I will scorch the cilia
off your ear,

28:19.398 --> 28:22.869
little... you little
Box Store toady.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.771
Hector, we need a
restock over here.

28:24.804 --> 28:25.938
TAMMI:
Whoa. No.

28:25.972 --> 28:27.139
That is not going to happen.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.808
Yeah, we need to
put all these items

28:28.841 --> 28:30.943
back on the shelves.
Hey, hey,
don't touch my stuff!

28:30.977 --> 28:32.111
What... this is mine.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.379
No! Give me...
CASHIER:
Guard!

28:33.412 --> 28:35.281
This is ridiculous.
Ma'am.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.817
You're going to
have to leave now.
Don't touch me.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.953
My husband is a detective
on the Los Angeles police force!

28:40.987 --> 28:43.155
(crowd cheering and applauding)

28:44.356 --> 28:46.292
(garbled radio transmission)

29:01.240 --> 29:03.843
SAMMY:
Hey, man.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.277
Hey, you mind, pal?

29:05.311 --> 29:07.346
You know, this don't work
too good if they look up

29:07.379 --> 29:09.481
and see a freaking
police car. Huh?

29:09.515 --> 29:11.450
How is it going?

29:11.483 --> 29:12.919
Great.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.288
So, what have we got?

29:16.322 --> 29:18.190
A little hot
in here, huh?

29:18.224 --> 29:20.526
That's an understatement.

29:20.559 --> 29:23.095
(chuckling)

29:23.129 --> 29:24.330
All right.

29:24.363 --> 29:27.299
Let's see what
the children are up to.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.974
Hey, that guy you chased down

29:35.007 --> 29:37.176
with the gun--
still not talking?

29:37.209 --> 29:38.510
NATE:
No, man.
He lawyered up.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.412
He's scared shitless
of Trinny.

29:45.351 --> 29:46.452
What?

29:47.186 --> 29:48.888
Nate, come here.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.472
What's your daughter
doing here?

30:13.545 --> 30:15.481
(dogs barking)

30:35.001 --> 30:37.069
(sighs)

30:39.105 --> 30:40.439
That's too bad.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.074
Let's check out some
of the neighbors.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.876
See if anyone
knows anything.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.344
Yeah.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.320
That's them.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.387
What?

30:55.421 --> 30:56.455
That's them.
Let's go.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.324
Grab the plate.
How do you know?

30:58.357 --> 30:59.525
I know.

30:59.558 --> 31:02.061
Three Tom Henry...

31:02.094 --> 31:03.162
Ocean...

31:03.195 --> 31:05.264
Three Tom Henry Ocean.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.933
Go.

31:06.933 --> 31:09.635
(siren wailing,
tires screeching)

31:09.668 --> 31:12.538
BEN:
A-43. Show us in pursuit

31:12.571 --> 31:14.006
of a green
Toyota Tercel,

31:14.040 --> 31:16.542
license plate Three
Tom Henry Ocean

31:16.575 --> 31:19.178
Four Seven Nine.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.547
Northbound,
east of Vermont,

31:21.580 --> 31:23.449
on 40th.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.051
Right, right,
right, right.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.253
(tires screeching)

31:33.960 --> 31:35.661
Come on, where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

31:37.529 --> 31:39.365
Got him.
I got him-- 3:00.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.537
(tires screeching)

31:57.183 --> 31:58.550
(siren continues wailing)

31:59.751 --> 32:01.487
(tires screeching)

32:09.695 --> 32:10.997
(siren shuts off)

32:13.065 --> 32:14.466
(men screaming)

32:15.567 --> 32:16.668
The gas tank's leaking!

32:20.139 --> 32:21.507
Loosen your seat belt.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.475
Let's go! Let's go!

32:34.420 --> 32:37.223
DISPATCHER (over radio):
What do you got up there?

32:40.726 --> 32:43.295
I want to clear
something up.

32:43.329 --> 32:44.563
I'm not an addict.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.298
All right, I'm not
one of these people

32:46.332 --> 32:48.067
like your mother's friends
up there in Beverly Hills

32:48.100 --> 32:51.337
with their ennui and their
Vicodin and their white wine.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.771
I have an on-duty
back injury.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.506
You don't have to
explain anything to me.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.708
That pain medication allows me
to stay on the streets

32:56.742 --> 32:59.378
or I lose
my field certification.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.347
If I can't be out there,

33:01.380 --> 33:03.315
you might as well put
a bullet in my head.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.319
(whispering):
I'll put a bullet in your head.

33:07.353 --> 33:09.188
(siren chirps)

33:09.221 --> 33:12.258
Man, we got everything--
guacamole, salsa, tamales.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.292
Excuse me.

33:13.325 --> 33:14.326
How are you guys?

33:14.360 --> 33:15.794
Eat, everybody, eat.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.329
Mariella spent all day working
on these tamales.

33:17.363 --> 33:18.464
Yes, there's
so much food.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.066
They're so great.
Please eat up.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.200
Hi.
She's been so good.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.201
Oh.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.769
Such a good girl.

33:23.802 --> 33:26.372
She's my little
princess.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.507
(indistinct chatter)

33:33.379 --> 33:35.481
Hi.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.683
Hi.

33:37.716 --> 33:40.086
Oh, my God, she's so beautiful.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.087
Yeah.

33:41.087 --> 33:42.221
Can I hold her?

33:42.254 --> 33:43.755
Yes, of course.

33:43.789 --> 33:44.756
Hey.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.092
Just be careful.

33:48.094 --> 33:50.396
She has her daddy's
eyes, right?

33:50.429 --> 33:51.597
You're late.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.665
Where were you?

33:53.699 --> 33:54.766
Nowhere.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.568
(baby fussing)

33:56.602 --> 33:57.569
Where were you?

33:57.603 --> 33:59.538
With Lola, okay?

33:59.571 --> 34:02.341
What's the
matter with you?

34:03.409 --> 34:05.344
Give me my daughter, please.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.214
Come on.

34:08.247 --> 34:10.182
(indistinct chatter)

34:26.198 --> 34:28.234
SAMMY:
Tammi.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.336
In here.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.837
Been sitting
in a hot van all day.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.140
We only busted
one guy.

34:35.141 --> 34:36.375
What a waste.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.311
I'm pissed.

34:39.345 --> 34:41.713
Sorry.

34:43.815 --> 34:47.319
Nice.

34:47.353 --> 34:49.821
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.757
There's no
toilet paper?!

34:51.790 --> 34:54.593
Hang on a sec.

34:56.362 --> 34:57.363
Here.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.269
What's this?

35:03.302 --> 35:04.670
I went to Walgreens.

35:04.703 --> 35:05.704
Why?

35:05.737 --> 35:06.838
(sighs)

35:06.872 --> 35:08.274
Come on, I asked you
to do one thing.

35:08.307 --> 35:10.276
Why?

35:10.309 --> 35:11.877
No, I'm serious.

35:11.910 --> 35:14.613
I'm owed an
explanation.

35:14.646 --> 35:16.482
I had a
horrible day.

35:16.515 --> 35:18.717
I don't want
to talk about it.

35:25.257 --> 35:28.227
Dr. Ryerson?

35:28.260 --> 35:31.363
Detective Adams.

35:31.397 --> 35:34.333
How are
you doing?

35:34.366 --> 35:38.470
They keep telling me
how lucky I am to be alive.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.640
Well, I came to tell you we
caught the men that did this.

35:41.673 --> 35:45.377
It's not going to bring
your family back, I know,

35:45.411 --> 35:46.845
but at least
we know

35:46.878 --> 35:49.848
they won't be doing
this to anybody else.

35:49.881 --> 35:50.916
You did?

35:50.949 --> 35:52.284
You caught them?
(phone ringing)

35:52.318 --> 35:55.221
This afternoon.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.855
I'm sorry, I need
to take this call.

35:56.888 --> 35:57.923
Yeah?

35:57.956 --> 35:58.957
It's him, it's the father.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.659
What do you mean?

36:00.692 --> 36:01.827
I'm at Danny Sutton's
sister's place

36:01.860 --> 36:03.562
and everything is here--

36:03.595 --> 36:06.898
the girls' laptop,
everything-- but also--

36:06.932 --> 36:09.268
and this is going
to blow your mind--

36:09.301 --> 36:12.238
we found a wallet-sized photo
of the wife.

36:12.738 --> 36:13.739
Yeah?

36:13.772 --> 36:15.274
And on the back,

36:15.307 --> 36:17.776
we pulled off
the doctor's thumbprint.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.579
And remember those phone calls
on Ryerson's cell

36:20.612 --> 36:21.613
I couldn't I.D.?

36:21.647 --> 36:22.648
I now have

36:22.681 --> 36:24.483
the prepaid cell they went to.

36:24.516 --> 36:25.951
Well, that's
wonderful.

36:25.984 --> 36:26.985
I will let

36:27.018 --> 36:28.254
the doctor know.

36:28.254 --> 36:29.588
I'm here with him now.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.858
Sure, I'll give him
your condolences.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.526
I already have the uniforms
on their way.

36:36.262 --> 36:39.265
So, these, these men, did,
did they say anything?

36:39.265 --> 36:41.400
What, what are you doing?

36:41.433 --> 36:42.901
You're under arrest.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.270
What are you
talking about?

36:44.303 --> 36:46.272
For the murder
of your family.

36:46.272 --> 36:47.273
This is crazy.

36:47.273 --> 36:48.274
Get these off me.

36:48.274 --> 36:49.275
Somebody help me.

36:49.308 --> 36:51.310
Nurse!
He's all yours.

36:51.343 --> 36:52.744
Make sure I get
my cuffs back.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.813
OFFICER:
You got it.

36:58.450 --> 37:01.320
Hey, sis.
Hi.

37:02.454 --> 37:04.290
Okay, they're
still parking.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.292
Yep.

37:06.325 --> 37:08.894
Ben, you are going
to love Lilla.

37:08.927 --> 37:09.895
Is that sake?

37:09.928 --> 37:10.896
Yes.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.431
She's really cute,

37:12.464 --> 37:13.799
she's smart.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.934
Her dad's some hotshot
entertainment lawyer,

37:15.967 --> 37:18.737
but I swear
you would never know it.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.972
And Ward and Olivia
are coming, too.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.442
I know, I'm sorry, look,
I just couldn't get out of it.

37:23.475 --> 37:24.910
Okay?

37:24.943 --> 37:26.312
And here they come.

37:26.312 --> 37:27.513
Hi.
Hey,

37:27.546 --> 37:29.615
handsome.
Hey.

37:29.648 --> 37:30.782
Hey, girl.

37:30.816 --> 37:31.817
Don't worry,
man, I put

37:31.850 --> 37:33.018
my money in the meter.

37:33.051 --> 37:35.654
You parked valet.

37:35.687 --> 37:36.655
Hi.
Hi.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.624
This is
Lilla Greenberg.

37:38.657 --> 37:39.658
My big brother.

37:39.691 --> 37:40.692
Lilla, Ben Sherman.

37:40.726 --> 37:41.727
Nice to meet you.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.329
Nice to meet you.

37:43.362 --> 37:47.032
Okay, so I ordered a bunch
of sashimi for everybody.

37:47.065 --> 37:48.667
I got some robata
coming for the guys.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.536
Ooh, no raw salmon,
though.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.604
They took a 20-foot worm
out of an agent from UTA.

37:52.638 --> 37:53.939
Oh, so it's bullshit

37:53.972 --> 37:56.875
'cause I heard it was
an agent at Paradigm,

37:56.908 --> 37:59.077
a woman, but, you know, that's
how those things get started.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.612
OLIVIA:
Totally.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.581
So I, I heard you were
a police officer.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.915
Yeah.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.517
WARD:
Yeah, we got,
we got Wyatt Earp here.

38:05.551 --> 38:07.753
He got in a big old shoot-out
the other day, right?

38:09.488 --> 38:10.722
(yelps, laughs)

38:10.756 --> 38:14.560
You guys don't even know,
do you?

38:14.593 --> 38:17.429
Ben is the first person
to make it

38:17.463 --> 38:18.897
to the triple murder
in Hancock Park.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.966
Whoa, dude.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.469
OLIVIA:
God, that's awful. The mom
and her two daughters?

38:23.502 --> 38:24.970
Really, Ben?

38:25.003 --> 38:26.472
That was you?

38:26.505 --> 38:29.908
TMZ said it looked
like Manson in there, right?

38:29.941 --> 38:31.377
Yeah, it was
pretty bad.

38:31.377 --> 38:32.778
My mother said the
girls were raped

38:32.811 --> 38:33.912
before they were killed?

38:33.945 --> 38:35.914
OLIVIA:
Oh, God...

38:35.947 --> 38:37.783
CHLOE:
Yeah, actually,
how did they kill them?

38:37.816 --> 38:39.017
I mean, the newspapers--

38:39.050 --> 38:40.552
they didn't really
say anything, right?

38:40.586 --> 38:41.620
WARD:
Oh, that looks great.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.088
Uh...
Right here.

38:43.121 --> 38:44.623
Look at all that.
I am gonna need

38:44.656 --> 38:45.991
some more ginger.

38:46.024 --> 38:46.992
Thank you.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.627
Arigato.

38:48.660 --> 38:49.828
(Olivia laughs)

38:49.861 --> 38:52.063
Okay, so, what,
you just walk in there

38:52.097 --> 38:53.999
and they're all just
lying there dead?

38:54.032 --> 38:56.468
Maybe he doesn't want to
talk about it, you guys.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.604
No, but really,
were they, like, tortured?

38:58.637 --> 39:00.005
CHLOE:
Olivia, being
raped is torture.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.039
Okay, no,

39:01.072 --> 39:02.574
but you hear
that they do

39:02.608 --> 39:03.975
all this awful stuff
like cigarette burns...

39:04.009 --> 39:05.577
Uh, you know what?

39:05.611 --> 39:07.145
I, I'm sorry,
it's been a long day.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.548
It was really nice to meet you.

39:11.817 --> 39:14.720
(laughs)

39:14.753 --> 39:16.788
Okay.

39:16.822 --> 39:20.025
RENE:
Remember you were wondering how
the convenience store fit in?

39:20.058 --> 39:21.993
I think it was just
one of those things.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.662
The killers go to the house
at the agreed time,

39:23.695 --> 39:25.464
but instead
of being alone,

39:25.497 --> 39:27.766
the wife's got the girls
and they're going somewhere.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.068
So they think "What the hell?"
and they follow them.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.003
"Maybe she'll drop
the kids someplace

39:32.037 --> 39:34.940
and we can murder her
when she gets back home."

39:34.973 --> 39:38.076
They go to the convenience
store, they get a good look,

39:38.109 --> 39:40.612
and they're thinking they
might have hit the trifecta,

39:40.646 --> 39:43.582
so they follow them back to
the house and they kill them

39:43.615 --> 39:45.150
and then
they kill him, too,

39:45.183 --> 39:48.053
because at that point
they have to.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.988
Probably.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.156
"Probably."

39:51.189 --> 39:52.157
Is that good?

39:53.459 --> 39:55.461
It's good.

39:55.461 --> 39:58.063
(squeaking)

40:05.136 --> 40:07.105
(glass breaking)

40:07.138 --> 40:08.840
Aw, shh...

40:08.874 --> 40:09.875
Oh, my God, Mommy, help!

40:09.908 --> 40:11.209
Shh... it's me.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.444
It's me.

40:12.478 --> 40:13.679
What are
you doing?!

40:13.712 --> 40:14.946
What does it look
like I'm doing?

40:14.980 --> 40:16.214
I don't know!

40:16.247 --> 40:17.849
I'm crawling
through an unlocked window.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.017
How many times do I have
to tell you?

40:19.050 --> 40:20.886
You almost gave me
a heart attack!

40:20.919 --> 40:22.754
Well, it's better than
being raped and murdered, right?

40:22.788 --> 40:24.155
(door opens)

40:24.189 --> 40:26.024
Oh, Jesus, you've got
to be kidding me.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.158
What are you doing?

40:27.192 --> 40:29.094
He crawled
through my window!

40:29.127 --> 40:30.161
SAL:
It was wide open.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.162
You're crazy!

40:31.196 --> 40:32.798
He's nuts, Mom.

40:32.831 --> 40:34.900
Listen, I don't care
if you kill yourself smoking.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.067
That window stays locked

40:36.101 --> 40:37.669
at all times.

40:37.703 --> 40:39.638
Do it again, young lady,
and you're grounded.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.707
You hear me?

40:41.740 --> 40:43.975
Put the gun away,
for crying out loud.

40:44.009 --> 40:46.945
("Mystery Achievement"
by Pretenders playing)

40:56.522 --> 40:59.491
* Mystery achievement

40:59.525 --> 41:02.127
* Where's my sandy beach,
yeah? *

41:02.160 --> 41:04.095
* I had my dreams...

41:13.238 --> 41:15.206
You know, it goes against
my business instinct,

41:15.240 --> 41:17.142
but you might have a little
drug problem happening.

41:17.175 --> 41:18.209
Just get out of here.

41:20.045 --> 41:23.181
(chuckles)

41:23.214 --> 41:24.683
Okay.

41:26.552 --> 41:29.621
(gun firing, shells clinking)
