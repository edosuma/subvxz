00:00.191 --> 00:01.309
<i>Previously on
The Tudors...</i>

00:01.573 --> 00:01.893
Run!

00:06.685 --> 00:08.878
I congratulate your majesty.

00:09.038 --> 00:10.766
You have capted one
of the most beautiful town

00:11.442 --> 00:13.970
in France.
- We have gained
here a singular victory.

00:14.071 --> 00:17.240
And I mean to hold onto it.
I shall leave Surrey in
command of the town.

00:17.308 --> 00:20.243
- Surrey?
- Yes. Is that
a problem, Your Grace?

00:20.311 --> 00:23.913
- Those men that are made
by the King of vile birth

00:23.947 --> 00:27.250
have been the distraction of all
the nobility of this realm.

00:27.284 --> 00:29.752
And if God calls away the King,

00:29.820 --> 00:33.556
they will suffer for it.
- I want you to teach the
Earl a lesson in humility.

00:33.624 --> 00:36.926
You could arrange for some
misfortune to befall him.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.929
- I hear your master has
signed a separate treaty
with the French.

00:39.997 --> 00:42.498
I trusted him.
You should be relieved

00:42.599 --> 00:44.901
that you no longer
have to lie on his behalf!

00:44.935 --> 00:49.138
- Anne, sister. You know that I
never wanted to marry the King.

00:49.239 --> 00:52.442
I may at least use what
influence I now possess

00:52.576 --> 00:55.278
to further the cause that
I believe in with all my heart.

00:55.412 --> 00:58.781
- She's a heretic and still
you leave me in her care!

00:58.849 --> 01:02.285
I swear to you now that I will
burn however many heretics

01:02.353 --> 01:05.755
I have to. I will make
England faithful again.

01:05.789 --> 01:08.825
- The King's enterprise has
bankrupted our exchequer.

01:08.959 --> 01:12.095
- We are at our wits end to know
how to get revenues to pay
for the Boulogne campaign.

01:12.162 --> 01:15.131
- This war has proved disastrous
to the realm.

01:15.165 --> 01:17.133
- Even our Queen is a heretic.

01:17.201 --> 01:20.370
- And it will be God's work
to destroy her.

01:20.471 --> 01:23.806
- I want my victory
to be celebrated
in every house in England.

01:23.874 --> 01:27.176
I want the name Boulogne
imprinted on every
English heart.

03:21.325 --> 03:24.427
- Majesty.

03:44.382 --> 03:48.018
- I will have
no married priests.

03:51.289 --> 03:53.957
- Your Majesty. My Lord Hertford
desires an audience.

04:03.935 --> 04:06.303
- Hertford.

04:06.404 --> 04:09.072
- Your Majesty. We have
received news from France.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.708
The Earl of Surrey,
while rashly attacking

04:11.742 --> 04:16.079
French supply forces at Saint-
Etienne, just beyond Boulogne,

04:16.147 --> 04:18.081
has lost over 600 men,

04:18.216 --> 04:21.418
as well as all the captains
and gentlemen,

04:21.485 --> 04:24.254
who, for some reason, he had
placed in the front line.

04:43.274 --> 04:45.175
- My lords, I have heard
from several sources

04:45.276 --> 04:47.177
of the calamitous events
in Boulogne.

04:47.278 --> 04:49.813
It seems my Lord Surrey

04:49.947 --> 04:52.115
gave battle to a large
convoy of French,

04:52.149 --> 04:55.185
and was soundly defeated.

04:55.286 --> 04:57.988
With the death of his captains,

04:58.089 --> 05:01.458
and most of his gentlemen.
And all of this,

05:01.492 --> 05:05.128
despite my warnings not to be
bold and place Boulogne at risk.

05:05.162 --> 05:07.631
Therefore,

05:07.698 --> 05:10.000
I have commanded my Lord Surrey
to return here,

05:10.134 --> 05:13.470
to be examined as to his conduct
by Your Lordships.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.939
In the meantime,

05:16.007 --> 05:19.643
I will appoint you, my Lord
Hertford, as his replacement.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.645
You leave at once for Boulogne.

05:21.679 --> 05:24.314
I have also decided

05:24.348 --> 05:26.283
for his many great
works and talents,

05:26.317 --> 05:28.919
to appoint my secretary,

05:28.953 --> 05:31.988
Mr. Risley, Lord Chancellor,

05:32.089 --> 05:34.090
and to create him Baron Risley.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.760
- I am touched...

05:36.827 --> 05:39.863
and deeply honored
by Your Majesty's trust.

05:42.466 --> 05:44.267
- My Lord Suffolk?
- Majesty,

05:44.302 --> 05:46.703
there are rumors
of a large French fleet

05:46.804 --> 05:48.939
being assembled
and fitted out for war.

05:49.073 --> 05:52.909
So... the Emperor
has ordered

05:52.944 --> 05:56.413
all English ships and properties
in the Low Countries
to be seized.

05:56.447 --> 05:58.782
How shall we respond?

05:58.816 --> 06:01.785
- The Emperor...

06:01.919 --> 06:04.788
my God.

06:04.822 --> 06:09.092
When I think of my fidelity to
my friends

06:09.160 --> 06:10.627
and all of their betrayals?

06:14.131 --> 06:17.600
- Fleet being amassed...
- My Lord.

06:17.635 --> 06:20.937
- My Lord Hertford.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.473
- My Lord Hertford.
- Excellency.

06:23.574 --> 06:25.608
- May we speak
a moment, privately?

06:32.083 --> 06:34.451
- Well?

06:34.518 --> 06:37.287
- It seems, alas, that
many things are amiss

06:37.355 --> 06:40.623
in His Majesty's kingdom.
- What things?

06:40.658 --> 06:44.327
- The bad harvest and the burden
of His Majesty's debts.

06:44.462 --> 06:48.264
The plague among the sailors
of His Majesty's fleet

06:48.299 --> 06:50.633
with their swollen heads
and decayed ships.

06:50.668 --> 06:53.036
- Pray, Excellency,
what is your point?

06:53.137 --> 06:55.672
- The poisoning and the poverty

06:55.773 --> 07:01.144
of the King's realm
is in every way due to his rash

07:01.278 --> 07:04.014
and unsustainable
occupation of Boulogne...

07:04.115 --> 07:06.883
As Your Lordship would want.

07:10.454 --> 07:12.622
- It is true that I argued
against the war.

07:12.690 --> 07:15.658
But I lost the argument.

07:15.726 --> 07:19.562
- You lost the argument for war,
my Lord. But you can win
it for peace.

07:22.800 --> 07:26.336
Persuade the King of his folly
in hanging on to Boulogne

07:26.370 --> 07:28.505
against all reason.

07:30.674 --> 07:32.876
You and I may come
to some agreement.

07:35.513 --> 07:38.415
- My Lord.
- Mr. Risley.

07:38.516 --> 07:40.517
- You are to be congratulated.

07:40.651 --> 07:42.519
- Thank you, Your Grace.

07:42.653 --> 07:44.854
I confess I find
this sudden elevation

07:44.922 --> 07:47.991
beyond my imagining.
- No!

07:48.025 --> 07:50.026
But you must imagine it,

07:50.094 --> 07:52.529
and take great pleasure
in it, as we do.

07:52.663 --> 07:55.365
For surely, this must mean that
our cause is in the ascendancy,

07:55.433 --> 07:59.235
and that His Majesty tends
ever more firmly

07:59.336 --> 08:02.372
towards the Orthodox and
Catholic persuasion
and against Reform.

08:04.341 --> 08:07.177
- Well, I trust
Your Grace is right.

08:07.211 --> 08:11.214
But for my own part, I still
find the King so changeable,

08:11.315 --> 08:14.818
I wonder if he knows
his own Md.

08:17.988 --> 08:20.590
- Henry!
- Father!

08:20.691 --> 08:23.593
- Come here! Oh, it's good
to see you back at Court.

08:23.694 --> 08:25.762
I missed you.

08:28.032 --> 08:29.933
You remember Brigitte?

08:30.034 --> 08:32.501
- Yes, of course!
Bonjour, Mademoiselle.

08:32.535 --> 08:35.238
- Bonjour, Henry. I'm very happy
to see you again.

08:41.212 --> 08:43.113
- Mademoiselle Roussello
is now my official mistress.

08:43.214 --> 08:46.182
I am sorry to hear that

08:46.217 --> 08:48.384
her presence at Court makes your
mother, the Duchess,

08:48.452 --> 08:50.954
unhappy. But there
is no help for it,

08:51.055 --> 08:53.790
for your mother has made
me unhappy for a long time.

08:53.891 --> 08:56.593
- Poor Henry...
- No. He's old enough
to know the truth.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.064
And guess other things
about love.

09:01.098 --> 09:03.199
- Mademoiselle,

09:03.267 --> 09:06.402
if you make my father happy,
then you have also made
me happy.

09:06.470 --> 09:08.905
- See?

09:08.973 --> 09:11.074
- He's older and wiser
than he looks.

09:11.142 --> 09:13.076
- So are you.
- Right.

09:13.110 --> 09:15.778
Drinks.

09:20.251 --> 09:22.919
- How is Your Majesty?
- I'll tell you this, Kate.

09:22.953 --> 09:25.155
I felt ten times
better in France

09:25.256 --> 09:28.424
than I have these
past years since.

09:28.492 --> 09:30.894
What I hate
above everything

09:30.928 --> 09:34.097
are the interpretations.

09:34.131 --> 09:36.633
It doesn't seem to matter
who I talk to at Court.

09:36.734 --> 09:39.269
Ambassadors, clerics,

09:39.303 --> 09:43.439
courtiers... They all
interpret the facts

09:43.507 --> 09:47.110
to suit themselves.
For myself, God knows

09:47.178 --> 09:49.512
I've always spoken with candour
and honesty.

09:49.613 --> 09:51.581
But all about me now is guile,

09:51.615 --> 09:55.185
hypocrisy, and dishonesty.

09:59.290 --> 10:02.458
- Your Majesty,
I have written a book.

10:02.493 --> 10:05.161
May I show it to you?

10:05.262 --> 10:09.098
- A book?
What kind of book?

10:09.133 --> 10:13.770
- It's called
Lamentations of a Sinner.

10:13.804 --> 10:17.140
- Majesty.
- Do read the dedication.

10:23.614 --> 10:26.316
- "In praise of my most
sovereign lord and husband,

10:26.383 --> 10:28.484
"King Henry VIII,

10:28.552 --> 10:31.120
"who is not only
godly and learned,

10:31.155 --> 10:33.790
"but who is also our Moses,

10:33.857 --> 10:36.025
"since he has delivered us out
of the captivity and bondage

10:36.160 --> 10:39.896
"of the Pharaoh."
You mean Rome.

10:47.037 --> 10:48.972
You call the Pope's clergy
riffraff,

10:49.039 --> 10:52.108
which he planted
in his tyranny?

10:55.212 --> 10:57.880
"And in eternal gratitude
to my Lord and husband,

10:57.948 --> 11:00.750
"who has shown me by his works
a holier path,

11:00.851 --> 11:04.554
"and delivered me from the
ignorance of my blind faith."

11:04.622 --> 11:07.890
Kate. Do you mean this?

11:07.925 --> 11:11.861
- I do, Your Majesty.
And not just for myself.

11:11.929 --> 11:15.732
I mean it for
all your subjects.

11:19.570 --> 11:22.705
- My lady.

11:22.740 --> 11:25.174
Lady Herbert.

11:31.048 --> 11:33.583
- Your Majesty.
Bishop Gardner is here.

11:44.228 --> 11:46.396
- Majesty.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.364
I ask permission...

11:48.432 --> 11:51.401
To arrest and interrogate
a known...

11:51.468 --> 11:54.904
Heretic and Protestant
called Anne Askew,

11:55.005 --> 11:58.341
for fear that she has...

11:58.409 --> 12:01.511
friends here at Court.

12:04.882 --> 12:07.050
- You have my permission,
Your Grace.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.733
- Good English people.

12:23.801 --> 12:25.702
They tell us

12:25.736 --> 12:28.604
that some of us are not
fit to read the words

12:28.706 --> 12:32.275
of our Saviour and Lord.
I say to you,

12:32.376 --> 12:35.545
I would rather read five
lines in the Bible

12:35.579 --> 12:38.047
than hear five masses
in the temple!

12:38.115 --> 12:41.184
- The priest claims to turn

12:41.218 --> 12:43.553
the wine into God's blood,

12:43.687 --> 12:46.222
and the bread into God's body!

12:46.290 --> 12:49.292
But where is the proof?
Go and find

12:49.393 --> 12:51.861
the proof yourself!

12:51.895 --> 12:54.897
Let the bread lie in the box
for three months, and it will be

12:54.965 --> 12:58.401
mouldy, and so turn
to nothing that is good.

12:58.469 --> 13:00.636
- Make way!
- Wherefore, I am persuaded

13:00.738 --> 13:03.373
that it cannot be God!

13:03.407 --> 13:06.743
- Arrest that woman!
- Faith

13:06.810 --> 13:10.279
is my shield.
I now rejoice at heart,

13:10.414 --> 13:12.482
and hope bid me do so,

13:12.549 --> 13:16.619
for Thou shall take my part
and ease me of my woe!

13:16.720 --> 13:20.256
For Thou art my delight.

13:20.357 --> 13:22.725
No face, Lord,
to those who look...

13:22.793 --> 13:25.561
- My Lord Surrey,

13:25.596 --> 13:28.931
it has been put to us that
your defeat at Saint-Etienne

13:28.999 --> 13:31.033
was not, as you claimed,

13:31.101 --> 13:33.436
due to the unwillingness
of your soldiers,

13:33.504 --> 13:35.371
but to your own folly.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.340
And an empty confidence
in your own

13:37.408 --> 13:39.609
unreasoning bravery.

13:39.710 --> 13:41.744
How do you answer such a charge?
- I would answer

13:41.779 --> 13:43.646
it was not such a defeat.
There was loss

13:43.747 --> 13:46.149
and victory on both sides,
and as a matter of fact,

13:46.250 --> 13:48.751
the enemy took
more losses than we.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.587
- Even so, my Lord, our loss
was the more grievous,

13:51.622 --> 13:53.556
since we lost
all our captains, who you,

13:53.590 --> 13:57.093
regardless of the danger, sent

13:57.127 --> 13:59.929
into the front line.
- Your Grace, I think
you were never in battle.

13:59.997 --> 14:02.432
Those officers wanted

14:02.499 --> 14:05.601
to be in the front line.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.637
They charged with a cry
and with greater courage

14:07.738 --> 14:11.841
and in as good an order
as anyone would wait for.

14:11.942 --> 14:14.010
They were outnumbered, but they
broke through the enemy lines.

14:14.111 --> 14:15.945
They destroyed four-fifths
of the convoy.

14:16.013 --> 14:19.115
At that moment,
the French were in disarray,

14:19.249 --> 14:21.651
and if the few men
that this council

14:21.752 --> 14:24.187
had sent me had not panicked
and bolted,

14:24.288 --> 14:26.589
then His Majesty would now

14:26.623 --> 14:29.759
be celebrating a great victory.

14:31.762 --> 14:34.530
- But alas, my Lord, he is not.

14:34.631 --> 14:37.533
You took a risk in attacking an
enemy far superior in numbers,

14:37.634 --> 14:41.037
and you lost. You were
personally forced

14:41.138 --> 14:43.606
to flee the battlefield,
which is reprehensible.

14:43.674 --> 14:47.477
And one of only three ways
by which a knight companion

14:47.611 --> 14:50.379
can be degraded
from the Order of the Garter.

14:50.481 --> 14:53.850
- My Lord Surrey,

14:53.951 --> 14:55.685
my brother, Lord Hertford, has

14:55.819 --> 14:58.154
already announced
allegations against you

14:58.222 --> 14:59.956
for corrupt misuse
of office while

14:59.990 --> 15:02.358
you were Lieutenant
General of Boulogne.

15:02.459 --> 15:05.027
He has announced an immediate
purge on many of those

15:05.128 --> 15:07.330
that you appointed
to positions of authority.

15:07.397 --> 15:10.733
- Sir, believe me.

15:10.834 --> 15:13.002
There are just too many
witnesses that will tell you

15:13.070 --> 15:15.505
that Henry Howard
was never corrupted

15:15.539 --> 15:17.874
by personal considerations.

15:18.008 --> 15:22.512
Nor did his hand ever
close upon a bribe.
- Nevertheless,

15:22.546 --> 15:25.181
this council must confirm your
removal as Lieutenant General,

15:25.215 --> 15:28.851
as well as revoke your former
title, Captain of Boulogne.

15:28.919 --> 15:32.355
You are ordered
not to return to France.

15:32.389 --> 15:35.992
- I'm sure His Majesty
will see fit

15:36.026 --> 15:39.695
to countermand these orders

15:39.763 --> 15:41.531
after I have talked with him.
- My Lord,

15:41.598 --> 15:45.868
His Majesty has refused
to grant you an audience.

15:50.707 --> 15:52.675
- Has he?

15:54.011 --> 15:56.012
- My Lady.

15:56.079 --> 15:58.147
Sir Richard Rich.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.754
- Sir Richard.

16:07.190 --> 16:09.759
- Lady Mary.
- You have some news?

16:11.828 --> 16:13.930
- I regret to inform you that
Eustace Chapuys,

16:14.031 --> 16:16.332
once Imperial Ambassador
here, has died,

16:16.400 --> 16:20.269
soon after returning to Spain.

16:39.523 --> 16:42.391
- He was a remarkable man

16:42.526 --> 16:45.661
and a true friend.

16:48.332 --> 16:51.067
And... now I have nobody.

16:51.168 --> 16:54.337
- Lady Mary...

16:54.404 --> 16:56.739
Let me assure you

16:56.873 --> 16:59.709
that you still have many true
friends here at Court.

16:59.776 --> 17:01.944
Not least, Bishop Gardner.

17:02.045 --> 17:06.682
And Edmund Bonner, Bishop of
London, as well as many others

17:06.750 --> 17:10.386
who share the Catholic faith.

17:10.420 --> 17:14.056
Who continue to believe
as you believe.

17:14.124 --> 17:17.226
- And you?

17:19.061 --> 17:21.130
- Yes.

17:34.378 --> 17:36.746
- My poor brother is being
brought up a Protestant
and a heretic.

17:36.813 --> 17:40.583
And the King does nothing
to stop it.

17:40.651 --> 17:43.119
- Be assured,

17:43.253 --> 17:45.721
there is work afoot to stop it.

17:45.789 --> 17:47.723
But my Lord Gardner
needs to know

17:47.791 --> 17:50.092
that in these works,
he has your support...

17:50.160 --> 17:53.829
Even though they may touch
people close to you.

18:01.104 --> 18:04.674
- Send my love to His Grace.

18:04.775 --> 18:07.777
Tell him I will pray fervently
for his success.

18:11.515 --> 18:13.683
Anne Askew.

18:13.784 --> 18:16.252
- Yes, sir.
- We hear that you still

18:16.286 --> 18:19.622
openly, and in public,
preach heresy.

18:19.690 --> 18:23.159
- I preach
the Word of God, sir.

18:23.293 --> 18:25.161
To all who will listen.

18:25.262 --> 18:27.129
- It seems you have
friends here at Court.

18:27.197 --> 18:29.632
But then, your
brother once served

18:29.666 --> 18:31.600
in the King's
household, I think.

18:31.635 --> 18:35.871
- Yes, sir.
- We think these
friends may include

18:35.972 --> 18:39.275
some ladies-in-waiting
to Her Majesty.

18:39.309 --> 18:41.977
The Duchess of Suffolk,
for example.

18:42.012 --> 18:44.346
Or Lady Herbert,
the Queen's sister.

18:44.448 --> 18:46.315
- We know that you've received

18:46.383 --> 18:49.185
monies, whilst you've been
imprisoned, for your relief.

18:49.286 --> 18:51.987
We believe...

18:52.122 --> 18:55.057
That diverse important ladies

18:55.158 --> 18:57.193
sent you that money.

19:01.498 --> 19:03.666
- There was
a man in a blue coat

19:03.700 --> 19:05.534
who delivered me ten shillings.

19:05.635 --> 19:07.903
- And what did he say?

19:10.540 --> 19:15.411
- He said, "My Lady Hertford
sent it to me."

19:15.512 --> 19:17.880
- With the support
and permission of the Queen.

19:21.485 --> 19:23.819
Come, come, Mistress Askew!

19:23.854 --> 19:26.355
We can make you speak.

19:36.700 --> 19:42.104
Have her moved down
one level to the chamber.

19:42.205 --> 19:45.374
- Your Grace, I cannot allow...
- You will do

19:45.442 --> 19:47.910
as we say...

19:48.044 --> 19:50.379
Sir Edmund.

19:59.556 --> 20:02.224
- No, no! No!

20:12.569 --> 20:15.271
- Please. Please!

20:28.151 --> 20:30.119
- Mistress Askew.

20:35.926 --> 20:38.961
Your Grace has been
badly misinformed as to the
events in Boulogne.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.664
- I am very prepared
to believe it, my Lord.

20:41.798 --> 20:43.833
- Again and again,
the Council refused

20:43.934 --> 20:46.235
to send reinforcements
that I asked for.

20:46.303 --> 20:50.472
Even the garrison
at Calais refused to help,

20:50.574 --> 20:52.842
except to send
some flat-footed,

20:52.943 --> 20:55.010
squint-eyed, unshapely men
unfit to carry arms.

20:55.111 --> 20:59.949
And now, my command is revoked.

21:00.016 --> 21:02.618
Now I am a man of no service.

21:02.686 --> 21:04.587
No activity.

21:04.621 --> 21:07.256
And I must sit at home within
the walls.

21:07.290 --> 21:10.459
- Do not think of this as the
end of your life, my Lord.

21:10.527 --> 21:14.196
God has given you grace,
courage, liberality.

21:14.297 --> 21:17.666
And after Saint-Etienne,
He also gave you good luck.

21:21.471 --> 21:24.506
Luck deserted you for a moment,

21:24.608 --> 21:25.975
but if the rest go on,

21:26.042 --> 21:28.043
then you will soon serve
the King's Majesty again.

21:28.144 --> 21:31.981
And have every chance to regain

21:32.048 --> 21:33.983
your honor and reputation.

21:34.050 --> 21:35.985
- I thank your Grace
for your words,

21:36.052 --> 21:38.220
but the truth of it is,
I was undermined

21:38.321 --> 21:41.790
and attacked from the start
of my command in Boulogne.

21:41.825 --> 21:46.228
And now, I swear to you,

21:46.363 --> 21:49.331
Hertford will smart
for usurping my place.

21:49.366 --> 21:51.333
- I would counsel Your Lordship

21:51.468 --> 21:52.868
not to raise arms against
Hertford.

21:53.003 --> 21:55.237
- I haven't the choice.

21:55.338 --> 21:59.341
Your Grace, it's sure
the King will die

21:59.409 --> 22:02.411
before the Prince reaches
his maturity.

22:02.512 --> 22:05.047
So who will then govern
the Prince...

22:05.148 --> 22:07.650
And the realm?

22:16.159 --> 22:18.827
- Just pinch her, for God's
sake. Just pinch her that's all.

22:18.862 --> 22:21.697
Nothing more.

22:28.672 --> 22:30.539
- We ask you again.

22:30.607 --> 22:33.075
Which of the ladies
of Her Majesty's chamber sent

22:33.209 --> 22:36.879
you monies or promises
of relief?

22:39.449 --> 22:43.018
- We want to know which
of the Queen's Ladies share

22:43.053 --> 22:46.255
your beliefs.

22:46.389 --> 22:49.959
Or if the Queen herself does.

22:50.060 --> 22:54.196
- We must stretch her further.
- My Lords!

22:54.230 --> 22:56.398
It is absolutely against

22:56.466 --> 22:58.534
the King's Law to rack a woman!

22:58.568 --> 23:02.071
And I will do it no further
on my conscience.

23:02.138 --> 23:04.640
- Come, come, Sir Edmund.
You know perfectly well
we have the authority

23:04.741 --> 23:07.443
of the King
himself to examine her.
- I do not know at all

23:07.577 --> 23:10.212
that you have His Majesty's
permission for this.

23:13.917 --> 23:16.218
Come!

23:21.257 --> 23:23.993
- You foolish woman.
Let me ask

23:24.094 --> 23:26.562
you something.

23:28.832 --> 23:32.434
Do you say that priests cannot
make the body of Christ?

23:32.502 --> 23:35.270
- I say so, my Lord.

23:35.405 --> 23:38.807
For I have read
that God made man.

23:38.908 --> 23:41.777
But that man can make God,

23:41.811 --> 23:44.246
I have never yet read.

23:44.314 --> 23:47.750
- And after the consecration,
is it not the body of Christ?

23:47.784 --> 23:50.452
- No. It is
but consecrated bread.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.554
- And what if a mouse eats it

23:52.589 --> 23:55.457
after the consecration?

23:55.592 --> 23:58.160
What shall
become of that mouse?

23:58.261 --> 24:00.963
Hm?

24:01.064 --> 24:03.899
What say you?
Stupid woman.

24:06.136 --> 24:08.771
I say that mouse is damned.

24:08.838 --> 24:11.807
- Poor mouse.

24:51.047 --> 24:53.315
- What is it?
- Your Majesty,

24:53.349 --> 24:56.485
I must tell you
that the woman Anne Askew

24:56.519 --> 24:58.787
has been put to torture
in absolute violation

24:58.822 --> 25:00.889
of Your Majesty's laws.

25:16.673 --> 25:18.574
- You were right
to come and see me.

25:18.675 --> 25:22.010
So I may explain to you,
and ease your conscience.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.747
In cases of extreme heresy,

25:25.849 --> 25:30.352
the law makes no distinction
between a man and a woman.

25:32.355 --> 25:34.389
For as you know, Sir Edmund,

25:34.491 --> 25:36.758
the devil takes many forms.

25:36.860 --> 25:40.028
And yet, it is
always the devil.

25:49.372 --> 25:53.775
- Wake up.
Wake up!

25:59.549 --> 26:03.051
- We desire to ask you again
about the Queen.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.889
Come, now.

26:07.690 --> 26:10.092
Speak, lady.

26:10.160 --> 26:14.229
- His Majesty, the King!

26:46.496 --> 26:49.064
- My well-beloved Commons,

26:49.165 --> 26:53.101
I come here today
to speak with you,

26:53.169 --> 26:56.271
to set forth my mind
and the secrets of my heart.

26:56.339 --> 26:59.908
There should be perfect love

26:59.943 --> 27:02.477
and concord in this
realm. But instead,

27:02.579 --> 27:04.680
there is discord

27:04.781 --> 27:06.915
and dissention in every place.

27:06.983 --> 27:10.619
What love and charity is there
amongst the clergy

27:10.653 --> 27:14.456
when one calls the other
heretic and Anabaptist?

27:14.490 --> 27:18.527
And the other calls
him Papist and hypocrite?

27:18.628 --> 27:20.629
Are these tokens of charity

27:20.763 --> 27:23.465
amongst you?
Are these

27:23.499 --> 27:27.803
the signs of fraternal love?
The people look

27:27.937 --> 27:31.807
for light. And you
bring them darkness.

27:31.841 --> 27:34.643
And as for the laity,

27:34.677 --> 27:36.945
you are not clean
of malice and envy,

27:36.980 --> 27:38.981
for you slander

27:39.048 --> 27:41.717
and rebuke priests and bishops.

27:41.818 --> 27:44.119
You take it upon yourself
to judge the clergy

27:44.153 --> 27:46.888
by the sole light of your
fantastical opinions

27:46.990 --> 27:49.358
and vain expositions.

27:49.492 --> 27:53.328
Although you are permitted
to read Holy Scripture,

27:53.396 --> 27:55.464
you must understand that it is

27:55.531 --> 28:00.002
under license and only
to inform your conscience.

28:00.069 --> 28:04.006
Not to dispute
and make scripture.

28:06.843 --> 28:10.012
I gave you the Bible in your own
tongue, but I am sorry to see

28:10.079 --> 28:12.681
that most precious jewel,
the Word of God,

28:12.749 --> 28:16.852
has been disputed, rhymed,

28:16.886 --> 28:20.322
sung and jangled in every
alehouse and every tavern
in this realm.

28:23.559 --> 28:26.495
I, whom God has appointed
his Vicar here,

28:26.529 --> 28:28.730
will see these
divisions extinct,

28:28.865 --> 28:31.033
and those enormities corrected.

28:31.067 --> 28:33.568
Or God shall

28:33.670 --> 28:35.671
account me an unprofitable
servant.

28:35.738 --> 28:39.341
Therefore...

28:39.375 --> 28:42.277
Be of charity with one another,

28:42.378 --> 28:45.681
like brother and brother.

28:45.748 --> 28:47.749
Love,

28:47.850 --> 28:50.385
dread, and serve God,
to which I,

28:50.420 --> 28:53.121
as your supreme head,
and sovereign Lord

28:53.222 --> 28:56.124
exhort and require you.

28:56.225 --> 28:58.860
And I doubt not, but that love

28:58.895 --> 29:01.730
and affinity which I spoke
of at the beginning

29:01.798 --> 29:04.633
shall never be dissolved

29:04.734 --> 29:07.135
or broken between us.

29:44.774 --> 29:47.142
- What did the King
say, Sir Thomas?

29:47.243 --> 29:49.511
- He was angry
with the religious
divisions in his realm.

29:49.612 --> 29:51.613
He said that he gave people
the Bible to read,

29:51.647 --> 29:55.117
but not so that they could
dispute its meanings.

29:55.184 --> 29:57.919
- It seems to me like
His Majesty is like one

29:57.987 --> 30:00.589
who would throw a man headlong
off the top of a high tower

30:00.656 --> 30:02.991
and ask him to stop when
he is halfway down.

30:03.092 --> 30:04.926
But surely, our delivery

30:05.061 --> 30:07.462
from the tyranny
of Rome and blind faith

30:07.597 --> 30:09.931
is not the end of the Reform

30:10.066 --> 30:13.101
and the renewal of our Christian
life, but it is only
the beginning.

30:13.169 --> 30:15.404
- The King does suppose that
only he knows

30:15.438 --> 30:17.773
the Will of Kod,
and so whatever he thinks

30:17.907 --> 30:20.442
should therefore be the new
Orthodoxy, however fantastical.

30:20.510 --> 30:23.478
It is like
his own private religion.

30:23.613 --> 30:27.015
And yet, he asks for an end to
division for charity and love.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.951
- Sir Thomas,
he is still the King.

30:30.019 --> 30:32.020
And if he asks
for charity and love,

30:32.121 --> 30:35.957
then he is doing
no more than Christ did.

30:36.092 --> 30:38.794
- Madam, the King has
opened a Pandora's Box.

30:38.828 --> 30:41.129
And whether he will or not,

30:41.197 --> 30:44.132
he simply cannot close
it now, whatever his complaints.

30:46.903 --> 30:49.771
You look troubled.
What is it?

30:49.839 --> 30:53.308
- I fear now, more than ever,
the machinations of men.

30:53.376 --> 30:56.044
How their plots and plans swirl
about the Court and the King.

30:57.980 --> 31:00.882
I can sense it, but I have
no knowledge anymore.

31:00.950 --> 31:04.519
No one, it seems, least of all
the King, confides in me.

31:04.620 --> 31:08.323
- But is it not better so?
- In some ways,

31:08.391 --> 31:11.126
since it leaves me free
to love you at my leisure.

31:13.329 --> 31:15.464
But in other ways,
it condemns my high station

31:15.498 --> 31:18.433
to neglect affairs of the realm,
especially now.

31:18.534 --> 31:20.335
Men conspire
to secure his future,

31:20.436 --> 31:23.538
and their own profit.

31:23.639 --> 31:25.807
- But I don't understand.

31:25.908 --> 31:27.809
How can they secure the future?

31:27.910 --> 31:29.978
- By controlling the Prince.

31:33.349 --> 31:36.685
It's widely supposed that the
King's infirmities grow worse.

31:36.819 --> 31:39.354
And he will not live to see

31:39.388 --> 31:41.556
the Prince come to maturity.

31:43.659 --> 31:46.194
- Do you still love the King?

31:50.733 --> 31:52.834
- My Lord Hertford.
- Majesty.

31:52.902 --> 31:55.203
- So. There is peace
with France.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.675
- Only if Your Majesty
accepts the terms.

32:00.743 --> 32:04.746
- What are the terms?

32:10.520 --> 32:12.821
- In 8 years' time,

32:12.889 --> 32:15.023
Your Majesty
will hand back Boulogne.

32:15.157 --> 32:17.826
In return...

32:17.960 --> 32:21.129
for a payment
of 2 million crowns.

32:24.867 --> 32:27.569
- 2 million?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

32:27.670 --> 32:30.672
The Admiral of France,
Claude d'Annibault,

32:30.806 --> 32:34.142
will come here to Your Majesty's
court to sign the peace treaty.

32:34.210 --> 32:37.579
If Your Majesty so desires.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.581
- Your Majesty?

32:42.852 --> 32:46.521
- You've done well,
my Lord Hertford.

32:49.759 --> 32:52.027
- Majesty.

32:58.100 --> 33:01.102
- My Lord.
- Majesty.

33:01.203 --> 33:02.737
His Grace, Bishop Gardner,

33:02.838 --> 33:04.839
having examined
the heretic Anne Askew,

33:04.874 --> 33:07.175
requests
Your Majesty's permission

33:07.209 --> 33:09.945
to order the arrests of three
of Her Majesty's ladies.

33:10.046 --> 33:13.348
Including Her Majesty's sister,

33:13.416 --> 33:15.584
Lady Herbert.

33:15.685 --> 33:17.719
His Grace would like
to question them

33:17.720 --> 33:20.388
as to their knowledge and
keeping of forbidden materials

33:27.730 --> 33:29.898
- What?

33:29.932 --> 33:32.367
- Stay at the door.
- Yes, my Lord.

33:35.404 --> 33:37.305
- Gentlemen.

33:37.406 --> 33:40.241
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

33:44.480 --> 33:47.582
- Here is a very great
undertaking,

33:47.650 --> 33:49.551
upon which our lives
will depend.

33:49.619 --> 33:52.721
But what we must
first decide is

33:52.788 --> 33:54.789
how best to approach Windsor...

33:57.593 --> 33:59.661
and in what manner
to overcome the guards

33:59.762 --> 34:01.329
that surround the Prince.

34:01.430 --> 34:04.799
And so, remove him.

34:07.169 --> 34:09.504
For, be in no doubt, gentlemen,

34:09.605 --> 34:14.775
that he who possesses
the heir to the throne will

34:14.844 --> 34:17.978
very soon possess
the throne itself.

34:32.128 --> 34:34.129
- Her Majesty, the Queen!

34:43.139 --> 34:46.174
- My Lord Risley.
- Your Majesty.

34:46.308 --> 34:50.645
- Your Grace.
- Your Majesty.

34:55.384 --> 34:58.286
- May I dance?
- Of course you may, my Lady.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.894
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

35:05.995 --> 35:09.497
- Your Majesty.
- My Lord Hertford.

35:09.565 --> 35:12.000
I am most glad to see you
returned from France.

35:12.034 --> 35:14.202
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

35:14.336 --> 35:17.305
- Bishop Gardner has
arrested my sister

35:17.373 --> 35:20.008
and two of my ladies
on suspicion of heresy.

35:22.211 --> 35:26.181
- Your Grace.
- Lady Mary.

35:29.051 --> 35:30.952
How go your
investigations?

35:31.053 --> 35:34.222
- They go well.

35:34.356 --> 35:36.725
For we have discovered
certain books

35:36.792 --> 35:40.562
in the closets
of the Queen's ladies,

35:40.629 --> 35:43.131
about which they will
be questioned further.

35:43.232 --> 35:46.401
- And the heretic, Anne Askew?

35:46.469 --> 35:49.137
- Ah, well I'm happy
to tell, good lady,

35:49.238 --> 35:52.974
that on His Majesty's orders,
she is condemned

35:53.075 --> 35:55.243
to be burned at Smithfield.

36:04.887 --> 36:06.888
- SEIZE HIM!

36:09.091 --> 36:11.559
My Lord Surrey, you are under
arrest for treason.

36:21.303 --> 36:25.340
Sweetmeats.
Fresh meats!

36:25.441 --> 36:28.510
Come on in, everyone!

36:28.577 --> 36:31.679
- Sir. Sir.
- What does he want, my Lady?

36:31.747 --> 36:34.349
Here.

36:34.450 --> 36:37.519
Tie this around her neck.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.287
It will end
her suffering quickly.

36:39.355 --> 36:42.290
Take it.

36:42.324 --> 36:44.259
Not just for the money,

36:44.293 --> 36:46.928
But also for the love of God.

37:30.840 --> 37:33.074
- My Lady Hertford.

37:33.175 --> 37:35.743
- What do you want?

37:35.845 --> 37:38.479
- Just to let you know that
Bishop Gardner would
like to see you.

37:38.514 --> 37:42.650
Very soon.

37:50.526 --> 37:52.861
- What's this?

37:52.962 --> 37:55.864
- Gunpowder.

37:55.898 --> 37:58.366
Gift from a friend.

38:50.786 --> 38:53.121
- My Lord Surrey.

38:53.255 --> 38:55.757
If the King should die,

38:55.824 --> 38:59.727
leaving the Lord Prince at his
tender age, have you either

38:59.795 --> 39:02.230
devised or suggested who should
govern him in this realm?

39:02.264 --> 39:04.766
- Whether that is,

39:04.833 --> 39:07.268
you have ever said
that in such a case,

39:07.303 --> 39:10.104
you would have the rule
and governance of him?

39:10.172 --> 39:12.840
Or words to that effect?

39:12.942 --> 39:16.210
- Yes, yes, cousin Knyvit.
I understood the question.

39:19.782 --> 39:21.582
- Also, is it true that you
willfully bear the Royal Arms

39:21.650 --> 39:23.751
of King Edward the Confessor?

39:23.886 --> 39:26.287
And claim to be
the next heir or kin to him?

39:29.258 --> 39:32.927
- I only put in my coat of arms
what I am entitled to put there,

39:33.062 --> 39:34.996
Sir Richard.

39:35.097 --> 39:36.764
- I'll tell you this,
my Lord Surrey,

39:36.832 --> 39:39.133
if ever you got power here,

39:39.234 --> 39:44.272
in this realm, I would
go abroad and stay there.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.941
Because I would be so afraid
of your malice.

39:47.076 --> 39:51.079
- Cousin Knyvit, I am maliced
not so low as you.

39:51.113 --> 39:54.082
My malice goes much higher.

39:54.149 --> 39:57.085
He said his malice
went even higher?

39:57.152 --> 39:59.587
- Yes, Your Majesty.

39:59.688 --> 40:02.390
My informants tell me that
it was the intention

40:02.458 --> 40:04.459
of Surrey and his associates

40:04.526 --> 40:07.662
to usurp authority
by means of the murder

40:07.763 --> 40:09.630
of all members of the Council,

40:09.665 --> 40:11.466
and the control of the Prince
by them alone.

40:11.533 --> 40:15.069
- God forbid they should
have succeeded

40:15.137 --> 40:17.739
in their abominable enterprise!
- Yes, Your Majesty.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.842
Thank God the whole
was found out.

40:25.647 --> 40:28.049
- I used to love him.

40:28.150 --> 40:29.984
Yes, I've always known
he was proud

40:30.052 --> 40:33.521
and foolish. But I loved
him for all that.

40:38.594 --> 40:41.329
Now he has forfeited my love.

41:07.656 --> 41:10.892
- Martin.
- My Lord.

41:18.200 --> 41:20.601
- Did you get the dagger?
- Yes, my Lord.

41:20.702 --> 41:24.272
- Good man.

41:27.376 --> 41:29.444
Come over here.

41:49.631 --> 41:51.599
That's the river.

41:51.700 --> 41:55.103
It comes right up at high tide.

41:55.237 --> 41:57.905
I can just about fit down
the shaft, I'm certain.

41:57.973 --> 42:00.741
Go now, to St. Catherine's dock,

42:00.776 --> 42:03.211
get a boat.
Wait for me there.

42:03.278 --> 42:05.713
I should be with you
by midnight.

42:05.747 --> 42:08.382
For the love of God,
Martin, do as I ask,

42:08.417 --> 42:11.886
for if I do not escape
from this place...
- Yes, my Lord.

42:15.290 --> 42:18.392
- Sister. There, there!

42:18.460 --> 42:20.962
Weep no more.

42:21.063 --> 42:25.199
You were released!
Nothing has been found.

42:25.267 --> 42:28.202
Everything is going
to be all right.

42:28.270 --> 42:30.204
Believe me.

42:30.239 --> 42:32.206
Everything is going
to be all right.

42:34.276 --> 42:37.211
Darling Anne, you're safe.

42:37.279 --> 42:40.081
You're safe.

42:55.898 --> 42:58.166
Close the door!

43:16.785 --> 43:19.187
- He's escaping!
Help me!

43:31.266 --> 43:34.802
- My Lords, members of the jury.

43:34.870 --> 43:37.772
For either of the offenses
the Earl has committed,

43:37.806 --> 43:40.675
he deserves death.

43:40.776 --> 43:42.944
First, for usurping
the Royal Arms,

43:43.045 --> 43:45.146
which gives rise
to the suspicion

43:45.214 --> 43:47.548
that he hoped to become
King. The other,

43:47.649 --> 43:50.651
for escaping from prison,
whereby

43:50.686 --> 43:54.555
he proved his guilt.
- You are false!

43:54.656 --> 43:57.658
And to earn a piece of gold,
would condemn your own father!

43:59.695 --> 44:02.163
I never sought
to usurp the King's Arms.

44:02.231 --> 44:05.199
For everyone knows

44:05.334 --> 44:07.401
my ancestors bore them!

44:09.671 --> 44:13.207
Go to the church in Norfolk.
You will see them there.

44:13.342 --> 44:15.476
For they have been ours
for 500 years.

44:15.510 --> 44:18.212
- Hold your peace, my Lord!

44:18.347 --> 44:20.181
Your idea

44:20.249 --> 44:24.852
was to commit treason
and become King!
- And you!

44:24.886 --> 44:28.022
You cats pole!

44:28.583 --> 44:31.082
What have you to do with it?

44:31.183 --> 44:33.783
You had better
hold your tongue!

44:33.884 --> 44:38.401
For this kingdom has never been
well since the King put

44:38.502 --> 44:41.417
mean creatures like you into
this government!

44:46.466 --> 44:48.803
- Silence in court!

44:48.871 --> 44:51.376
Silence!

44:51.477 --> 44:55.352
- If, as you say,
the accusations are false,

44:55.419 --> 44:58.425
can you explain to us why
you tried to escape the Tower?

45:01.000 --> 45:03.840
- I tried to escape to prevent
myself from coming

45:03.941 --> 45:07.449
to the pass in which I am now.

45:09.387 --> 45:13.228
And you, my Lord, well know

45:13.329 --> 45:17.137
that no matter how right
a man may be,

45:17.205 --> 45:20.043
they always find
the fallen one guilty.

45:22.048 --> 45:24.319
- You have only yourself
to blame, my Lord,

45:24.420 --> 45:27.426
for the pass you're in.
- No.

45:27.494 --> 45:30.866
It was a friendly foe.

45:30.967 --> 45:33.604
My shadow of good will.

45:33.705 --> 45:35.608
My old companion

45:35.709 --> 45:37.878
and dear friend
that trapped me.

45:40.816 --> 45:43.352
- Henry Howard.

45:43.420 --> 45:46.055
How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

45:49.461 --> 45:51.429
- How will you be tried?

45:51.497 --> 45:55.735
- By God, and the country.

46:19.010 --> 46:21.046
I knew that
I hated the Earl.

46:21.113 --> 46:25.486
But I am surprised, Sir Richard,
that you share my antipathy.
- My Lord Hertford,

46:25.587 --> 46:29.392
you should not be so surprised,
since the Earl hates
us both the same.

46:29.460 --> 46:31.996
So I am sure...

46:32.064 --> 46:35.936
All of us will prosper
better without him.

46:36.037 --> 46:39.509
- I agree.

46:39.610 --> 46:43.415
My Lords, forgive me.

46:43.516 --> 46:45.651
But as foreman of the jury,
I have to tell your Lordships

46:45.719 --> 46:48.656
that we are not impressed with
the evidence against
my Lord Surrey.

46:48.724 --> 46:51.594
It is very clear to us

46:51.661 --> 46:53.796
that my Lord Surrey has
the right to bear the arms

46:53.898 --> 46:57.501
of Edward the Confessor. And as
to the plot against His Majesty,

46:57.569 --> 47:01.607
we can find no credible
evidence to support it.

47:01.675 --> 47:04.143
Sirs...

47:04.211 --> 47:06.513
We do not think it right
and proper that the Earl should

47:06.614 --> 47:09.216
be condemned
for such... trifles.

47:09.284 --> 47:11.252
- Sir Christopher, whenever has

47:11.320 --> 47:15.624
innocence been cause
to save a man's life

47:15.692 --> 47:17.961
when the King deems him unfit
to live in the Commonwealth?

47:18.029 --> 47:20.131
- My Lord.

47:20.199 --> 47:22.534
This is a trial under law.

47:22.635 --> 47:24.604
- Master Hayden,

47:24.672 --> 47:27.508
if you did not know it before,
then you know it now.

47:27.576 --> 47:29.411
The law is whatever
His Majesty says it is.

47:29.479 --> 47:32.782
And if you provoke His Majesty,

47:32.849 --> 47:36.254
then you, too, will feel
the full force of it.

48:06.195 --> 48:08.130
- What is wrong, Lady Mary?

48:08.198 --> 48:11.668
Are you unwell?
- No, Madam.

48:11.769 --> 48:15.573
- Then?

48:18.244 --> 48:20.679
- I have heard some rumors.

48:20.780 --> 48:23.115
- Rumors about what, Lady Mary?

48:23.216 --> 48:26.819
- The new Imperial
Ambassador has told me

48:26.887 --> 48:28.955
that in Antwerp
and in other foreign places,

48:29.023 --> 48:31.958
that they are saying the King
is looking for a new wife.

48:32.060 --> 48:34.962
- Why should they say so?

48:37.134 --> 48:40.604
- Despite the length
of your marriage,

48:40.705 --> 48:44.308
you have still not presented
His Majesty with a child.

48:47.079 --> 48:49.113
- Lady Mary.

48:51.517 --> 48:53.585
We were such good friends.

48:53.652 --> 48:56.755
You remember that, don't you?

48:56.823 --> 49:00.125
Well, for me, nothing
has changed.

49:00.193 --> 49:02.927
And I love you,
as I did before.

49:02.995 --> 49:05.229
But something has happened,

49:05.330 --> 49:08.299
and you no longer love
me as you did before.

49:10.168 --> 49:12.669
Why?

49:12.737 --> 49:15.605
Gentlemen
of the jury,

49:15.673 --> 49:17.807
how do you find the defendant?

49:29.085 --> 49:33.121
- Guilty!

49:33.189 --> 49:35.357
- And he should die for it!

49:48.807 --> 49:52.043
- Of what have you found
me guilty?

49:54.747 --> 49:57.248
Surely, there is no law

49:57.349 --> 50:00.252
that justifies you.
But I know the King

50:00.353 --> 50:02.453
wants to get rid

50:02.555 --> 50:06.724
of all the noble blood
around him.

50:06.792 --> 50:10.795
And employ none but low people.

50:13.365 --> 50:16.967
- Not guilty!
- This trial is a sham!

50:17.035 --> 50:20.436
- No chop, chop!
- Henry Howard...

50:20.504 --> 50:23.606
- Release him!
- You will be taken to the place

50:23.674 --> 50:26.642
from whence you came,
and there,

50:26.743 --> 50:28.644
to be dragged through
the city of London

50:28.712 --> 50:31.279
unto the place of execution
called Tyburn!

50:34.249 --> 50:36.150
There, to be hanged,

50:36.218 --> 50:38.352
cut down while still alive,

50:38.420 --> 50:40.655
your privy parts cut off,
and your bowels taken out

50:40.756 --> 50:42.990
of your body and burned
before you.

50:43.091 --> 50:45.660
Your head cut off,

50:45.761 --> 50:47.996
and your body divided
into four parts.

50:48.097 --> 50:52.166
The head and the quarters
to be set at such places

50:52.234 --> 50:54.569
as the King shall assign.

50:54.670 --> 50:57.905
Where's the King?
This is a travesty!

51:18.127 --> 51:21.029
<i>The happy life
be these:</i>

51:21.130 --> 51:23.031
<i>The quiet mind,</i>

51:23.132 --> 51:25.099
<i>the equal friend,</i>

51:25.167 --> 51:28.902
<i>no grudge, no strife,</i>

51:28.970 --> 51:31.104
<i>wisdom</i>

51:31.172 --> 51:33.206
<i>joined with simplicity,</i>

51:33.308 --> 51:36.276
<i>the night</i>

51:36.344 --> 51:38.745
<i>discharged of all care.</i>

51:38.813 --> 51:43.450
Where's the King?

51:48.823 --> 51:52.191
â™ª

51:54.695 --> 51:56.963
- Thank you, Lord Risley.
- The King is saved
from conspirators.

51:57.064 --> 51:59.031
And Anne Askew...

51:59.099 --> 52:01.233
- Sweetheart?

52:01.334 --> 52:04.502
I hear you've been busying
yourself with your books.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

52:04.570 --> 52:08.673
I have translated works
by Erasmus,

52:08.774 --> 52:10.842
as well as buying
a beautiful book of psalms

52:10.909 --> 52:13.411
by Thomas Berthelet.

52:13.512 --> 52:16.047
- I wonder, Kate,

52:16.114 --> 52:18.015
at your diligence.

52:18.083 --> 52:20.852
- Well, I regard it as much
my duty as my pleasure,

52:20.953 --> 52:24.590
to place such wonderful books

52:24.691 --> 52:27.026
before the good English people
who have been a long time

52:27.094 --> 52:30.063
thirsting and hungering
for the sincere

52:30.164 --> 52:32.399
and plain knowledge
of God's Word.

52:32.467 --> 52:34.501
- Just be cautious.

52:34.569 --> 52:37.404
Not every English person can
read or understand the Gospels.

52:37.472 --> 52:39.406
And you are to be careful

52:39.507 --> 52:41.508
of the consequences
of encouraging them to try.

52:41.609 --> 52:43.510
- Majesty, I am not afraid
of the Gospels,

52:43.611 --> 52:45.845
nor should anyone be afraid.

52:47.915 --> 52:50.682
Your Majesty has begun
a great work in banishing

52:50.783 --> 52:53.218
the monstrous idol of Rome.

52:53.286 --> 52:55.220
And now with God's help,

52:55.288 --> 52:57.623
you can finish that work

52:57.691 --> 53:00.760
by purging the Church of England
of its dregs.

53:18.045 --> 53:20.947
Majesty...
- Forgive me. I am tired.

53:35.562 --> 53:38.231
- Majesty.

53:38.299 --> 53:41.434
Kate.

53:49.008 --> 53:51.242
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

53:52.878 --> 53:54.980
- Majesty.
- Majesty.

53:55.047 --> 53:56.915
- Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

53:57.016 --> 53:59.817
- Your Majesty.

53:59.918 --> 54:01.919
- What a thing it is,

54:01.986 --> 54:05.288
when women become such clerks,

54:05.389 --> 54:07.723
and what a comfort it will
be to me in my old age

54:07.825 --> 54:10.793
to be lectured to by my wife.

54:10.861 --> 54:13.562
- Your Majesty has no need
to be taught by anyone.

54:15.732 --> 54:18.268
Your knowledge of divinity
excels that of the princes

54:18.335 --> 54:21.371
and divines
throughout the ages.

54:23.641 --> 54:28.179
Forgive me, but I think
it unseemly for any

54:28.280 --> 54:32.117
of your subjects
to argue with you,

54:32.218 --> 54:36.121
as the Queen has
just done. Majesty,

54:36.222 --> 54:39.391
many of the greatest
subjects in the land

54:39.492 --> 54:43.361
defending those same arguments
that she does

54:43.428 --> 54:46.931
have, by law, deserved death.

54:47.032 --> 54:49.900
- I cannot believe

54:49.968 --> 54:52.836
that you would accuse the Queen
of heresy without proof.

54:52.903 --> 54:57.741
- I have the proof.
But what I need

54:57.842 --> 55:00.945
is Your Majesty's consent
to draw up certain articles

55:01.046 --> 55:04.482
against the Queen, so that
she may be put on trial.

55:12.091 --> 55:15.761
- She could be put
on trial. And yet,

55:15.829 --> 55:18.998
I am fully resolved
to spare her life.

55:19.065 --> 55:21.267
- Certainly.

55:21.368 --> 55:25.138
Whatever Your Majesty desires.
