00:11.595 --> 00:13.362
Sam texted us an "X."

00:13.419 --> 00:14.497
What does that mean?

00:14.522 --> 00:15.716
Our deal with the kids.

00:15.741 --> 00:17.992
Tim, if they ever need
an emergency ride home,

00:18.017 --> 00:20.013
all they have to do is
text an "X," an address,

00:20.047 --> 00:21.391
we go pick them up, no questions asked.

00:21.415 --> 00:23.349
Where is my good bra?

00:23.374 --> 00:25.252
Can I go like this? I
feel like this is good.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.408
She's never texted us an "X" before.

00:27.433 --> 00:28.974
What do you think that means?

00:28.999 --> 00:30.424
I don't know. It sounds dirty.

00:30.457 --> 00:32.591
I mean, that might just
be 'cause of the "X."

00:32.616 --> 00:34.437
Maybe we should've called
it "Come and Get Me."

00:34.461 --> 00:36.884
'Cause that can't sound sexual
unless they said, like...

00:36.909 --> 00:37.920
(BREATHILY): "Come and get me."

00:37.944 --> 00:39.066
But why would they say that?

00:39.100 --> 00:41.435
Stop it. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:42.536 --> 00:45.106
I had a bad dream you were abandoning me

00:45.139 --> 00:47.574
in the middle of the...

00:47.608 --> 00:49.443
Oh, no.

00:49.476 --> 00:51.370
Oh, shoot.

00:51.395 --> 00:53.680
Somebody needs to stay
here for Sophia. You stay.

00:53.714 --> 00:55.340
- No, you.
- Oh, Tim.

00:55.365 --> 00:58.952
This is even worse than being abandoned.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.842
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11.009 --> 01:13.450
Okay, I'm not gonna ask any questions,

01:13.475 --> 01:15.202
but why are you wet?

01:15.236 --> 01:17.604
- That's a question, Mom.
- I know, I know. I hear that now.

01:17.638 --> 01:20.843
- Can we just go?
- Well, you just asked a question.

01:20.868 --> 01:23.259
- Mom.
- Okay, fine. Fine, fine, fine.

01:26.626 --> 01:28.615
The "X" text sucks.

01:28.649 --> 01:30.151
Okay? I'm sorry.

01:30.184 --> 01:32.953
Somebody gets into your car soaking wet,

01:32.986 --> 01:36.157
you want to know why.
Right? This is still America.

01:36.190 --> 01:38.659
You're not the only one who
had a rough night, you know.

01:38.692 --> 01:41.795
I fell asleep eating kale
chips. They're that boring.

01:41.828 --> 01:45.098
(SIGHS) Tim, I just...
I-I can't do this.

01:45.123 --> 01:47.593
I need to know what happened last night.

01:47.618 --> 01:49.236
- So ask Sam.
- No.

01:49.270 --> 01:51.505
Because if I ask her, she
won't text us next time

01:51.538 --> 01:53.140
because she'll never trust us again.

01:53.174 --> 01:55.155
- I'm sure she's fine now.

HEATHER: Hey, guys.

02:12.793 --> 02:14.094
What you up to?

02:14.127 --> 02:18.031
Well, we're actually having
our first real struggle

02:18.064 --> 02:19.859
about where we want to be in our lives.

02:19.884 --> 02:22.703
Yeah, so, I need a favor
from the two of you.

02:23.259 --> 02:24.638
Last night,

02:24.671 --> 02:26.908
Sam texted Dad and me an "X."

02:26.933 --> 02:28.026
Oh, yeah, we know.

02:28.051 --> 02:29.776
- She told us all about it.
- Mm-hmm.

02:29.810 --> 02:31.712
Oh, okay, 'cause, I
mean, she told me a lot.

02:31.745 --> 02:33.880
Like, you know, she told
me all about the pool stuff.

02:33.914 --> 02:35.216
- Right?
- Yeah, I can't comment

02:35.249 --> 02:37.351
as to whether there
was or was not a pool.

02:37.384 --> 02:38.819
- Okay.
- Do I need to remind you

02:38.844 --> 02:40.053
about the "X" text rules?

02:40.086 --> 02:42.434
No, you do not, because the rules are

02:42.459 --> 02:44.793
that I can't ask the texter,

02:44.818 --> 02:48.036
but I can ask other people.

02:48.329 --> 02:49.508
Yeah, I think you would agree

02:49.533 --> 02:51.635
that that's a liberal
interpretation of the rules.

02:51.660 --> 02:54.324
I would agree that you
live here rent-free.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.013
- Look, Mom, I understand how you feel.

is that Sam is fine.

Yeah. Well... she will be.

03:02.495 --> 03:05.045
That is all that Clementine

to unlock Sam's phone

03:16.901 --> 03:18.436

03:18.461 --> 03:19.936
so that I can get into her social media,

03:19.960 --> 03:21.161
find out what happened.

03:21.194 --> 03:23.029
- You can't do that.
- I know.

03:23.063 --> 03:25.508
She's sleeping on her stomach.
You got to flip her over.

to pick her up from school

03:39.212 --> 03:41.782
and she would talk the entire way home.

03:41.815 --> 03:43.417
She would tell me every detail.

who cried, who threw up.

03:47.254 --> 03:48.855
It's Sam.

I feel lucky to have a mom like you.

04:28.161 --> 04:29.996
you were going to
badger me about the party

do you want me to do?

09:21.369 --> 09:24.457
Just call the theater. Tell
them to... end the trick.

09:24.490 --> 09:25.892
I think by the time I do that,

09:25.926 --> 09:28.094
you know, the trick
will probably be over.

09:28.128 --> 09:30.030
I know. I'm sorry.

09:30.732 --> 09:32.699
I shouldn't have eaten the poutine.

- Uh...

09:36.683 --> 09:38.471
did you just text me an "X"?

09:38.504 --> 09:39.572
Yeah.

- You okay?

10:52.861 --> 10:53.812
Yeah, yeah.

10:53.837 --> 10:55.283
No, I'm just, you know, exhausted,

10:55.308 --> 10:56.558
and the baby's starving.

10:56.591 --> 10:58.402
- And I don't know what Lark is doing.
- Ta-da! Ta-da! Ta-da!

- Ta-da!
- You know what, go upstairs

10:59.962 --> 11:03.265

breastfeed, and sleep.

11:03.290 --> 11:05.282
John and I will take care of Lark.

11:05.307 --> 11:08.171
Oh, really? Thank you so much.

You know, I know I complain
about these brunches,

11:10.391 --> 11:13.574

part of such a close family.

Yeah.

Honey, what's the matter? What is it?

11:34.907 --> 11:36.999
I just saw Jen's boob.

11:37.032 --> 11:38.927
What? How?

11:38.952 --> 11:40.802
Well, I-I had to go to the bathroom,

11:40.835 --> 11:43.121
so I use the one up in Greg's room.

11:43.146 --> 11:46.241
And Jen was there, asleep.

11:46.826 --> 11:48.010
And it was out.

11:48.043 --> 11:49.697
So she doesn't even know.

11:49.722 --> 11:51.079
That's wonderful.

11:51.113 --> 11:52.647
But... No. But she will know.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.149
I've got to tell her.

11:54.189 --> 11:56.162
No, no, no, no, no. Trust me.

11:56.187 --> 11:57.389
Don't tell her.

11:57.414 --> 11:59.587
You'll only embarrass her.

11:59.621 --> 12:00.831
(STAMMERS) But the world is changing.

12:00.855 --> 12:02.424
I need to get out in front of this.

You see something, you say something.

12:05.314 --> 12:07.782
Dear, that's at the airport.

12:08.055 --> 12:09.844
Just let this go.

12:12.167 --> 12:13.768

12:13.801 --> 12:16.038
No, uh, uh, not even looking.

12:16.071 --> 12:17.372
Oh. Well, I don't blame you.

12:17.405 --> 12:19.807
Colleen brought a peanut
butter and jelly frittata.

12:19.841 --> 12:21.476

call me old-fashioned,

- Yeah, yeah.

I mean, I don't think
I'm really hungry. Mm-hmm.

12:28.483 --> 12:31.707
Oh, hey, by the way, thank
you for watching my girls.

12:31.732 --> 12:33.621
You know, you and Joan
just always do so much

12:33.655 --> 12:35.457
to make me feel welcome in this family,

12:35.490 --> 12:37.892
and-and now you've really
made me feel comfortable.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.461
I saw your boob.

12:39.849 --> 12:40.856
What?

12:40.881 --> 12:43.512
Yeah, y-you were
asleep, feeding the baby,

12:43.537 --> 12:44.832
with your boob out.

12:44.866 --> 12:46.834
That's fine. I mean,
I breastfeed in public

12:46.868 --> 12:48.470
all the time. It's natural.

12:48.503 --> 12:50.205
No, no. The feeding was over.

12:50.238 --> 12:53.275
The baby was down,
and-and the boob was up.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.676
Like, all of it.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.010
Oh, God.

12:56.044 --> 12:57.479
I-I-I'm a horrible person.

12:57.512 --> 12:59.243
No better than Tim.

12:59.268 --> 13:01.017
Okay, look. It was an accident.

13:01.042 --> 13:04.204
So let's just never mention this again

13:04.229 --> 13:06.688
and forget the whole thing.

13:06.721 --> 13:08.456
Oh. Roger that.

13:11.244 --> 13:12.846
It's all good, buddy.

13:12.871 --> 13:15.205
I apologized, and Jen forgave me.

13:15.230 --> 13:17.232
- For what?
- For seeing her boob.

13:17.265 --> 13:18.933
You saw my wife's boob?

13:18.966 --> 13:20.704
Well, that's your first mistake.

13:20.729 --> 13:22.437
She's her own wife, not yours.

13:22.470 --> 13:24.872
Time to evolve, Greg.

13:25.213 --> 13:27.175
Why didn't you tell me
my dad saw your boob?

13:27.209 --> 13:29.577
- Oh. You already told him.
- Mm.

13:29.611 --> 13:31.679
John, I thought you
were letting this go.

13:31.713 --> 13:32.680
JEN: Oh.

13:32.714 --> 13:34.729
He told you, too. Fun.

13:34.754 --> 13:35.888
Calm down.

13:35.913 --> 13:38.019
I told Joanie before you.

13:38.052 --> 13:40.922
And I told you not to tell her.

13:40.955 --> 13:42.023
JEN: Mm-hmm.

13:42.056 --> 13:43.858
Okay, I need a moment alone.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.122
Can I come?

13:45.372 --> 13:46.261
Why not?

13:46.294 --> 13:48.730
There's no such thing
as privacy in this home.

13:50.432 --> 13:51.620
Hmm.

13:51.762 --> 13:53.745
If you want to make this better,

13:53.770 --> 13:55.751
stop embarrassing Jen.

13:55.776 --> 13:58.440
Ooh, John! What'd you
embarrass Jen about?

13:58.473 --> 14:00.642
Oh. Wait, what's going
on with you and Jen?

14:00.675 --> 14:02.221
Yeah, Dad, what happened?

14:03.073 --> 14:04.546
Something must have happened.

14:04.579 --> 14:07.096
- What's happening?
- Okay, fine.

14:07.658 --> 14:10.775
I know she wouldn't want me
telling this to you guys, but...

14:11.319 --> 14:12.954
Jen saw my penis.

14:12.987 --> 14:13.955
What?!

14:13.988 --> 14:16.086
I was upstairs feeding the baby,

14:16.111 --> 14:18.092
and she walked in.

14:18.117 --> 14:19.427
I didn't even know.

14:19.461 --> 14:20.895
How'd you not know?

14:20.928 --> 14:22.063
I'd fallen asleep.

14:23.331 --> 14:24.966
- Yes.
- While your penis was out?

14:24.999 --> 14:26.334
Yes, exactly.

14:26.368 --> 14:27.335
A-And I know

14:27.369 --> 14:28.836
it's an unlucky situation,

14:28.870 --> 14:32.607
but Jen has nothing to
be embarrassed about.

14:33.169 --> 14:34.204
HEATHER: Okay, Jen,

14:34.229 --> 14:37.032
I am so sorry about my dad.

14:37.057 --> 14:40.236
Seriously, John? You
told the entire family?

14:40.261 --> 14:42.784
Yep. Now the whole family
knows you saw my ween.

14:46.392 --> 14:47.524
Oh, it's so weird.

14:47.549 --> 14:48.923
John saw my boob.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.692
While you were looking at his ween?

14:50.725 --> 14:53.186
No. I wasn't looking
at his anything, okay?

14:53.211 --> 14:55.702
I was feeding the baby, I fell asleep,

14:55.727 --> 14:57.098
and John walked in.

14:57.131 --> 14:59.841
Then why did you tell us
that she saw your Lone Ranger?

14:59.866 --> 15:02.073
- What is the matter with you?
- (OTHERS TALKING)

15:02.098 --> 15:04.512

15:04.537 --> 15:06.841
to protect me from
being embarrassed by...

15:06.874 --> 15:08.876
I don't know, embarrassing himself.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.346

15:11.379 --> 15:13.294

you just told me the truth.

You know? No matter
how hard it was to hear.

15:18.476 --> 15:19.914

15:19.939 --> 15:21.189
I will end you, Tyler.

Look at this, everybody.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.743
Lark's Eiffel Tower.

18:15.768 --> 18:17.731
Ooh, is that perfect!

18:17.756 --> 18:19.918
I feel like I'm in Paris.

18:19.943 --> 18:21.473
(WHISPERS): I hate the French.

18:21.498 --> 18:22.733
Good work, Lark.

18:22.758 --> 18:24.840
Lucas made it for me.

18:24.865 --> 18:25.865
What's that?

18:25.978 --> 18:27.373
That's my son.

18:28.123 --> 18:30.910
He's talented and generous. Hey, Mommy?

18:31.230 --> 18:32.708
We are doing a great job.

18:32.733 --> 18:34.839
Oh, my God, I love it
when you call me Mommy.

18:34.864 --> 18:38.144
- Okay, this is disgusting, all of it.
- Hey, buddy,

18:38.169 --> 18:39.575
come on, now, don't beat yourself up.

18:39.599 --> 18:41.002
It's okay that you haven't
taught your daughter

18:41.026 --> 18:42.126
to explore her creativity.

18:42.151 --> 18:43.896
My daughter explores plenty.

18:44.438 --> 18:45.931
Certainly looks like it.

18:46.830 --> 18:48.258
JOAN: Oh, sweetie.

18:48.283 --> 18:49.932
Would you like a tissue?

18:50.533 --> 18:51.927
She learned that from her mother.

18:51.952 --> 18:53.153
Mm.

18:54.281 --> 18:56.740
Okay, so... Lark,
stop picking your nose.

18:56.765 --> 18:59.881
Okay, so, when we get out
there, okay, I'm gonna hide

18:59.906 --> 19:03.201
this five of spades right
here under Uncle Matt's chair,

19:03.226 --> 19:06.991
and when I say so, you
grab that card and you say,

19:07.031 --> 19:08.253
"Ta-da!"

19:08.286 --> 19:09.187
Ta-da!

19:09.212 --> 19:11.374
- Yeah. No, not yet.
- Ta-da!

19:11.399 --> 19:13.903
- Okay, I think I see what's...
- Ta-da! Ta-da!

19:13.928 --> 19:17.044
Uh, it is a fun word, but
let's not say that word

19:17.069 --> 19:19.575
until everyone is watching, okay?

19:19.600 --> 19:21.192
MATT: What's going on here?

19:21.217 --> 19:23.668
Are you teaching Lark magic
tricks to get attention?

19:23.771 --> 19:25.435
Ta-da!

19:26.990 --> 19:29.528
Look, you don't get it, man, all right?

19:29.553 --> 19:31.426
Lark had the spotlight all to herself,

19:31.451 --> 19:33.778
until someone came along
and stole it from her.

19:33.812 --> 19:36.597
You just described my entire life.

19:36.622 --> 19:38.449
I used to be the center of attention

19:38.474 --> 19:41.086
until you were born, but I got over it.

19:41.119 --> 19:42.855
- No, you didn't.
- But I don't bring it up.

19:42.888 --> 19:44.552
Yes, you do, all the time.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.363
Yeah, because it hurts
giving up the spotlight.

19:47.388 --> 19:48.816
That's why, 36 years later,

19:48.841 --> 19:51.096
you can't give it up to your own nephew.

19:51.129 --> 19:52.865
(SIGHS)

19:56.326 --> 19:59.145
Daddy, I forgot what the word was.

20:00.317 --> 20:01.739
Ta-da.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.956
("NUM NUM" BY THE DNC PLAYING)

20:13.339 --> 20:15.902
âª When I see you, baby
girl, I be like, num num âª

20:15.927 --> 20:18.133
We adopted a star.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.636
I mean, was it a
performing arts orphanage?

20:20.669 --> 20:22.037
âª I gotta have it... âª

20:22.070 --> 20:25.140
Can I show everybody my magic trick now?

20:25.779 --> 20:27.082
Uh...

20:27.107 --> 20:28.575
you know what?

20:28.600 --> 20:31.162
We're all watching
Lucas dance right now.

20:31.295 --> 20:32.715
And he's pretty great.

20:33.264 --> 20:35.083
Thanks, man. So is Lark.

20:35.117 --> 20:37.886
âª That num num, give it to me
before I start to act up... âª

20:37.920 --> 20:39.298
Hey, Lucas, maybe when you're done,

20:39.322 --> 20:41.648
you and Lark can go
out and ride bikes, huh?

20:41.673 --> 20:43.626
I don't know how to ride a bike.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.368
Yes.

20:46.493 --> 20:48.111
Maybe Lark can teach him.
