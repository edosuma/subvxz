WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.135
HEY, DAVE,
IS THAT THE BATHROOM?

00:04.135 --> 00:06.137
NO.
I THINK THAT'S IT THERE.

00:06.137 --> 00:08.039
OH, OKAY. THANKS.

00:08.039 --> 00:12.113
DAVE TRIED TO ELIMINATE
A WITNESS TO MURDER.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.144
HEY! UHH!

00:13.144 --> 00:15.686
BUT JACKSON SURVIVED...

00:15.686 --> 00:18.749
I BOUGHT M.J. A FISHING POLE.
 WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT THIS WEEKEND.

00:18.749 --> 00:21.021
I'M KIND OF GETTING MARRIED.
 WHAT?

00:21.021 --> 00:23.194
I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU
OUT HERE.
 JACKSON.

00:23.194 --> 00:25.356
FORCING HIM
TO CHANGE HIS PLANS.

00:25.356 --> 00:27.098
I'M A MIDDLE-AGED GUY...

00:27.098 --> 00:30.461
TOM WAS SEARCHING.
 AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WANNA DO WITH MY LIFE.

00:30.461 --> 00:33.104
WE'RE RICH AGAIN!
HALLELUJAH!

00:33.104 --> 00:35.166
GABY'S LIFE RETURNED TO NORMAL.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.768
WE'RE GONNA BE US AGAIN--
THE OLD CARLOS AND GABY.

00:37.768 --> 00:40.111
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU
WALK AWAY FROM THIS MARRIAGE

00:40.111 --> 00:42.673
WITH YOUR ASSETS INTACT.
NOW TO ACCOMPLISH THIS...

00:42.673 --> 00:45.516
AND BREE AGREED TO PROTECT
WHAT SHE FELT WAS HERS.

00:45.516 --> 00:48.519
I'M CAPABLE OF DOING
WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:58.629 --> 01:01.832
(Mary Alice) THE LAWYER ARRIVED
JUST AFTER SUNDOWN.

01:03.634 --> 01:07.268
HE CHECKED TO MAKE SURE
NO ONE WAS WATCHING,

01:07.268 --> 01:10.771
THEN HE HURRIED
TO THE FRONT DOOR...

01:10.771 --> 01:14.145
WHERE HIS CLIENT WAS WAITING.

01:15.646 --> 01:19.850
AS SHE POURED HIM
THE SCOTCH HE REQUESTED,

01:19.850 --> 01:21.812
THE CLIENT BEGAN TO WONDER

01:21.812 --> 01:24.715
EXACTLY HOW HE PLANNED
TO HIDE HER ASSETS

01:24.715 --> 01:27.788
FROM THE HUSBAND
SHE WAS DIVORCING.

01:27.788 --> 01:32.723
(speaking inaudibly)
 THE LAWYER SUGGESTED
SOME CREATIVE ACCOUNTING.

01:32.723 --> 01:35.426
HIS CLIENT AGREED.

01:35.426 --> 01:40.100
(speaking inaudibly)
 HE SUGGEST
A SECRET BANK ACCOUNT.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.173
SHE AGREED.

01:42.173 --> 01:45.406
(speaking inaudibly)
 HE SUGGESTED
A SECOND SET OF BOOKS.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.409
SHE AGREED.

01:48.409 --> 01:54.785
AND THEN THE LAWYER LOOKED
DEEP INTO HIS CLIENT'S EYES

01:54.785 --> 01:58.249
AND MADE
ONE FINAL SUGGESTION...
 (speaking inaudibly)

01:58.249 --> 02:02.493
THAT SHE WAS
COMPLETELY UNPREPARED FOR.

02:02.493 --> 02:05.196
YOU WANT ME TO ROB
MY OWN HOUSE?!

02:05.196 --> 02:08.799
NOT EXACTLY. I WAS THINKING WE'D
HIRE MY FRIEND TONY TO DO IT.
 ABSOLUTELY NOT.

02:08.799 --> 02:11.302
I AM ALL UP FOR
A LITTLE CREATIVE ACCOUNTING

02:11.302 --> 02:13.264
AND SOME
SECRET BANK ACCOUNTS,

02:13.264 --> 02:15.536
BUT HIRING SOME THUG
TO STAGE A BREAK-IN?

02:15.536 --> 02:17.538
IT'S A COMMUNITY PROPERTY STATE,
BABE.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.540
ORSON'S GOING TO GET HALF
OF EVERYTHING,

02:19.540 --> 02:22.142
INCLUDING YOUR JEWELRY,
YOUR ARTWORK, YOUR ANTIQUES.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.345
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER
TO JUST HAVE HIM KILLED?

02:24.345 --> 02:26.347
AS YOUR LAWYER,
I CAN'T CONDONE THAT.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.180
THAT SAID, I HAVE A COUSIN--
 I WAS KIDDING!

02:29.180 --> 02:32.152
SO WAS I.
LOOSEN UP, FRECKLES.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.154
WELL, I JUST NEVER KNOW
WITH YOU.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.156
AND DON'T CALL ME
"FRECKLES."

02:36.156 --> 02:38.158
LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT
COMFORTABLE WITH TONY,

02:38.158 --> 02:40.160
WHY DON'T WE DO THE JOB
OURSELVES?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.162
I BET YOU'D LOOK HOT
IN A SKI MASK.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.636
YOU ARE REPUGNANT,
AND THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

02:45.636 --> 02:48.639
FINE, BUT SINCE I'M CHARGING YOU
FOR THE FULL HOUR,

02:48.639 --> 02:52.473
LET ME MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE.
SIT DOWN AND CLOSE YOUR EYES.
 WHAT? NO!

02:52.473 --> 02:55.846
JUST HUMOR ME. COME ON.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.682
NOW I WANT YOU TO PICTURE ORSON
AFTER THE DIVORCE.

03:01.682 --> 03:06.186
HE OWNS HALF OF YOUR BUSINESS,
HALF OF YOUR ASSETS.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.488
YOU SEE IT?

03:07.488 --> 03:09.320
GO ON.

03:09.320 --> 03:13.564
NOW I WANT YOU TO PICTURE ORSON
DATING SOME YOUNG BIMBO.

03:13.564 --> 03:15.566
AND DON'T KID YOURSELF.

03:15.566 --> 03:17.968
HE WILL GET A BIMBO.

03:17.968 --> 03:20.471
NOW PICTURE
YOUR FAVORITE STRAND OF PEARLS

03:20.471 --> 03:24.405
DANGLING IN THE 24-YEAR-OLD
CLEAVAGE OF SAID BIMBO

03:24.405 --> 03:25.876
WHILE SHE IS USING

03:25.876 --> 03:28.879
YOUR FIRST EDITION ROBERT FROST
AS A COASTER...
 (gasps)

03:28.879 --> 03:32.343
AND YOUR 19th CENTURY
FRENCH CRYSTAL VASE

03:32.343 --> 03:33.844
AS AN ASHTRAY.

03:33.844 --> 03:36.216
IF YOU CAN LIVE WITH THAT...

03:36.216 --> 03:39.990
I WILL LEAVE.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.692
AND WITH THAT,

03:41.692 --> 03:44.525
THE CLIENT OFFERED
A SUGGESTION OF HER OWN...

03:44.525 --> 03:46.527
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
BREAK A WINDOW

03:46.527 --> 03:48.529
TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE REAL.

03:50.361 --> 04:03.274
AND THE LAWYER AGREED.

04:03.274 --> 04:05.245
MASKS--

04:05.245 --> 04:08.879
YOU CAN FIND THEM IN ANY HOME.

04:08.879 --> 04:13.354
SOME ARE USED ONCE A YEAR
TO SCARE THE NEIGHBORS...

04:13.354 --> 04:14.855
(spraying)

04:14.855 --> 04:19.029
SOME ARE NEEDED
FOR THE OCCASIONAL CHORE.

04:19.029 --> 04:24.695
SOME ARE APPLIED
EVERY OTHER THURSDAY.

04:24.695 --> 04:27.498
THEN THERE'S THE KIND OF MASK

04:27.498 --> 04:30.270
SOME MEN WEAR EVERY DAY.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.043
IT'S A FRIENDLY SMILE

04:33.043 --> 04:37.408
DESIGNED TO HIDE
THE MOST WICKED OF INTENTIONS.

04:37.408 --> 04:39.680
HEY, M.J.,
IS YOUR MOM HOME?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.752
SHE'S INSIDE TALKING
TO JACKSON.

04:43.854 --> 04:46.056
REALLY?

04:46.056 --> 04:49.990
SO... WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF JACKSON?

04:49.990 --> 04:53.824
I LIKE HIM.
HE BUYS ME COMIC BOOKS.

04:53.824 --> 04:56.567
YEAH, HE'S A GOOD GUY.

04:56.567 --> 04:58.569
HE WAS VERY BRAVE
THAT NIGHT

04:58.569 --> 05:00.971
DURING THAT FIRE
AT THE NIGHTCLUB.

05:00.971 --> 05:03.474
DOES HE EVER TALK ABOUT
THAT FIRE...

05:03.474 --> 05:06.036
OR ANYBODY HE SAW
THAT NIGHT?

05:06.036 --> 05:09.880
HAVE THE POLICE STOPPED BY
TO ASK HIM ANY QUESTIONS?

05:11.482 --> 05:14.915
IF THEY DO,
WOULD YOU LET ME KNOW?

05:14.915 --> 05:16.086
WHY?

05:16.086 --> 05:17.918
WELL...

05:17.918 --> 05:21.422
I WANNA MAKE SURE THEY'RE BEING
NICE TO OUR FRIEND JACKSON,

05:21.422 --> 05:24.355
'CAUSE HE'S SUCH A GOOD GUY.

05:30.100 --> 05:34.605
IT IS SUCH A STUNNING PIECE.

05:34.605 --> 05:38.008
IT'S SIMPLE AND ELEGANT.
DON'T YOU THINK?

05:39.940 --> 05:41.942
I MEAN, I KNOW
IT WAS EXPENSIVE,

05:41.942 --> 05:45.345
BUT YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE TAG
ON BEAUTY. AM I RIGHT?

05:47.017 --> 05:49.720
SO WHEN DADDY FINDS OUT
HOW MUCH I SPENT,

05:49.720 --> 05:53.023
WOULD IT BE OKAY IF
I USED YOU AS A HUMAN SHIELD?

05:54.785 --> 05:58.489
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD REALLY
 GET YOU TESTED.

05:58.489 --> 06:00.731
(front door opens and closes)

06:00.731 --> 06:02.733
MOM?

06:02.733 --> 06:04.865
HEY! DID YOU HAVE
A FUN PLAYDATE WITH HEATHER?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.367
SHE'S GOT A CANOPY BED.
I WANT ONE.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.671
WE JUST BOUGHT YOU A BED.
IT'S NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD.

06:10.671 --> 06:14.044
I DON'T LIKE IT ANYMORE.
I WANNA SLEEP UNDER A CANOPY.

06:14.044 --> 06:18.449
THEN GO MOVE IN WITH HEATHER,
'CAUSE I'M NOT GETTING YOU ONE.

06:18.449 --> 06:20.511
WHY NOT? WE'RE RICH.

06:20.511 --> 06:23.514
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
 I HEARD YOU TELLING AUNT BREE,

06:23.514 --> 06:26.717
SINCE DADDY GOT HIS NEW JOB,
WE'RE ROLLING IN MONEY.

06:26.717 --> 06:28.719
WELL, MOMMY SHOULDN'T HAVE
SAID THAT.

06:28.719 --> 06:32.062
JUST, WHEN AUNT BREE STARTED
BRAGGING ABOUT HER PRADA BAG,

06:32.062 --> 06:35.125
MOMMY KIND OF LOST IT.

06:35.125 --> 06:36.997
WHATEVER.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.970
I WANT A CANOPY,
AND YOU GOTTA GET ME ONE.

06:39.970 --> 06:42.633
I DON'T HAVE TO
GET YOU ANYTHING.

06:42.633 --> 06:44.635
AND STOP ACTING
LIKE A SPOILED BRAT.

06:44.635 --> 06:47.638
I AM NOT SPENDING A FORTUNE
ON A BED YOU DON'T NEED.

06:47.638 --> 06:50.911
OH, BUT YOU CAN SPEND MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS ON A STUPID VASE?

06:50.911 --> 06:53.544
THAT VASE IS NOT STUPID.

06:53.544 --> 06:55.486
IS THAT VASE STUPID?

06:57.588 --> 07:00.951
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER.

07:00.951 --> 07:03.454
GO TO YOUR ROOM!

07:03.454 --> 07:04.955
(sighs)
YOU, TOO, BOBBLEHEAD.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.500
OKAY, MY CLOTHES
ARE IN THE CLOSET.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.062
I'M GOING TO PUT MY TOOTHBRUSH
IN THE BATHROOM.

07:12.062 --> 07:14.765
(chuckles) OH,
JUST LEAVE THE TOILET SEAT UP,

07:14.765 --> 07:17.968
AND THE IMMIGRATION PEOPLE WILL
TOTALLY THINK WE'RE MARRIED.

07:17.968 --> 07:20.971
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA
THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.

07:20.971 --> 07:25.115
ACTUALLY, I DID THINK OF ONE WAY
YOU COULD REPAY ME.

07:25.115 --> 07:27.077
MMM. YOU GOT IT.

07:27.077 --> 07:29.580
UH, NO. (chuckles)
NOT LIKE THAT.

07:29.580 --> 07:32.853
NO, I WAS THINKING THAT AFTER
OUR QUICKIE COURTHOUSE CEREMONY,

07:32.853 --> 07:35.626
YOU COULD BUY ME A CAKE.

07:35.626 --> 07:37.087
I LOVE WEDDING CAKE.

07:37.087 --> 07:40.591
IT'S THE ONE PART OF MARRIAGE
THAT NEVER LETS YOU DOWN.

07:40.591 --> 07:42.593
WELL, I CAN DO YOU
BETTER THAN THAT.

07:42.593 --> 07:45.195
HOW ABOUT I THROW US
A BIG ENGAGEMENT PARTY?

07:45.195 --> 07:46.967
(chuckles) WHAT?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.969
WELL, WE'RE NOT HAVING
A WEDDING,

07:48.969 --> 07:51.141
AND WE'RE GONNA NEED
PICTURES OF SOMETHING

07:51.141 --> 07:53.143
TO PUT IN OUR PHOTO ALBUM
AS EVIDENCE.

07:53.143 --> 07:55.646
OKAY. YEAH,
I GUESS THAT COULD BE FUN.

07:55.646 --> 07:58.148
WHILE OUR FRIENDS ARE TOASTING
TO OUR EVERLASTING HAPPINESS,

07:58.148 --> 08:00.981
WE CAN YELL,
"SURPRISE! IT'S ALL A SHAM!

08:00.981 --> 08:02.983
THANKS FOR THE CROCK-POT!"
(laughs)

08:02.983 --> 08:05.916
NO, NO, NO. WE CAN'T TELL
ANYBODY THIS IS A FAKE.

08:05.916 --> 08:09.089
THE WHOLE THING
COULD BLOW UP.
 CAN'T I AT LEAST TELL
THE GIRLS?

08:09.089 --> 08:12.092
NO WAY. I MEAN, THEY DON'T
CALL HER "GABBY" FOR NOTHING.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.525
WOW.

08:14.525 --> 08:17.868
AH, FAKE MARRIAGES--
THEY'RE COMPLICATED.

08:17.868 --> 08:20.000
I-I-I KNOW I'M ASKING A LOT,
SUSAN.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.704
NO, NO. IT'S OKAY.
I WANNA DO THIS.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.076
TRUTH IS...

08:26.076 --> 08:28.278
I MISS YOU,

08:28.278 --> 08:31.281
AND THE HOUSE HAS BEEN KINDA
LONELY SINCE YOU LEFT.

08:31.281 --> 08:34.044
WELL, I HEAR YOU
LOUD AND CLEAR.

08:34.044 --> 08:36.515
NOT THAT LONELY.

08:38.188 --> 08:39.549
(exhales deeply)

08:39.549 --> 08:41.051
(door closes)

08:45.295 --> 08:46.997
(drops trash bag)

08:51.131 --> 08:53.934
(window whirs)

08:53.934 --> 08:55.936
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 THINKING.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.669
WELL, THINK INSIDE.
I MADE PORKCHOPS.

08:58.669 --> 09:01.211
AREN'T YOU GONNA ASK ME
ABOUT MY JOB INTERVIEW?

09:01.211 --> 09:03.844
OH, RIGHT. HOW'D THAT GO?

09:03.844 --> 09:06.847
OKAY... UNTIL THE 30-YEAR-OLD
WHO WAS INTERVIEWING ME ASKED ME

09:06.847 --> 09:10.651
IF I'D EVER USED TWITTERING
AS PART OF A MARKETING CAMPAIGN.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.783
AND WHAT'D YOU SAY?

09:12.783 --> 09:14.124
NOTHING...

09:14.124 --> 09:17.057
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT "TWITTERING" IS.

09:17.057 --> 09:20.060
IT'S A SOCIAL NETWORKING TOOL
WHERE YOU SEND INSTANT UPDATES

09:20.060 --> 09:22.963
TO ANYBODY
WHO SIGNS UP FOR THEM.

09:22.963 --> 09:27.768
SO... YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS,
AND YET YOU KEPT IT FROM ME?

09:27.768 --> 09:30.070
(chuckles)
I DIDN'T KEEP IT FROM YOU.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.603
IT'S JUST
ONE OF THOSE TECH THINGS

09:32.603 --> 09:34.805
THAT YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT.

09:34.805 --> 09:36.777
IT'S FOR YOUNG PEOPLE.

09:36.777 --> 09:40.681
AND I AM A DINOSAUR
MARCHING INTO THE TAR PIT.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.983
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
 (sighs)

09:42.983 --> 09:45.986
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
A WHOLE LOT OF SYMPATHY FROM ME.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.988
I JUST WENT THROUGH
THE SAME THING. REMEMBER?

09:47.988 --> 09:50.320
YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
HOW BAD IT WAS.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.793
THAT'S ANOTHER THING
YOU KEPT FROM ME.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.796
50 GUYS SHOWED UP
FOR THAT ONE JOB,

09:55.796 --> 10:00.030
AND I WAS 10 YEARS OLDER
THAN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF 'EM.

10:00.030 --> 10:02.773
I COULD HEAR 'EM TWITTERING
AS I LEFT THE ROOM.

10:02.773 --> 10:05.876
I THINK YOU MEAN
"TITTERING."

10:05.876 --> 10:09.079
SORRY. PLEASE, DON'T HIT ME.

10:09.079 --> 10:12.983
I HEARD A DOOR SLAM SHUT TODAY,
LYNETTE.

10:12.983 --> 10:16.887
IT'S OFFICIAL.
MY TIME HAS PASSED.

10:16.887 --> 10:19.750
I AM NO LONGER RELEVANT.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.052
OH, FOR GOD SAKES,
KNOCK IT OFF!

10:22.052 --> 10:24.755
I AM NOT GONNA LET YOU
FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF.

10:24.755 --> 10:27.157
YOU ARE TOM SCAVO,
DAMN IT!

10:27.157 --> 10:29.059
AND?

10:31.201 --> 10:35.335
SORRY. I GOT NOTHING ELSE.
COME INSIDE AND EAT YOUR PORK.

10:46.316 --> 10:49.079
(indistinct conversations)

10:49.079 --> 10:52.783
THIS PLACE SMELLS FUNNY.
 I DON'T WANNA BE HERE.

10:52.783 --> 10:54.785
WELL, YOU SHOULD'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

10:54.785 --> 10:57.157
BEFORE YOU STARTED ACTING LIKE
SUCH A DIVA. NOW SIT DOWN.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.359
FATHER CROWLEY!

10:59.359 --> 11:01.792
THIS IS A SURPRISE.
(chuckles)

11:01.792 --> 11:04.034
WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO OUR SOUP KITCHEN?

11:04.034 --> 11:06.737
WELL, I WANT JUANITA
TO WORK WITH THE POOR.

11:06.737 --> 11:09.039
I WANT TO TEACH HER
TO BE GRATEFUL

11:09.039 --> 11:12.042
FOR HOW GOOD SHE HAS IT.
 OH, WELL, WE CAN ALWAYS
USE A HAND.

11:12.042 --> 11:13.704
AND FOUR HANDS?
WELL, THAT'S A BLESSING.

11:13.704 --> 11:16.206
(chuckles) OH, ME? NO, NO.
NOT ME.

11:16.206 --> 11:18.108
I'M NOT REALLY DRESSED
FOR LADLING,

11:18.108 --> 11:20.811
BUT, UM, I COULD STAND
BY THE CONDIMENT BAR

11:20.811 --> 11:23.183
AND SPRITZ PEOPLE
WITH MY CHANEL.

11:23.183 --> 11:28.989
AND YOU SAY JUANITA
 IS A LITTLE UNGRATEFUL? HMM.

11:36.026 --> 11:37.697
FRAN SCHULMAN?

11:39.229 --> 11:40.200
FRAN.
 HUH?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.402
IT'S GABRIELLE SOLIS
FROM THE TENNIS CLUB.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.735
OH, OF COURSE.

11:44.735 --> 11:46.206
WOW, IT'S BEEN YEARS!

11:46.206 --> 11:50.210
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS
AT THAT CHARITY FASHION SHOW.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.082
WASN'T THAT FUN?
 YES. YES, IT WAS.

11:52.082 --> 11:54.244
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
ARE YOU VOLUNTEERING?

11:54.244 --> 11:56.917
NOT EXACTLY.
 ME EITHER.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.919
MY DAUGHTER'S GOTTEN
 SO SNOOTY,

11:58.919 --> 12:01.992
I AM FORCING HER TO SPEND TIME
WITH THE GREAT UNWASHED.

12:01.992 --> 12:04.995
YOU WANNA DITCH THIS PLACE
FOR A CAPPUCCINO?

12:04.995 --> 12:09.159
UM, ACTUALLY,
I'M HERE TO EAT.

12:09.159 --> 12:12.362
(laughing)

12:14.064 --> 12:16.066
OH!

12:19.810 --> 12:22.042
IT'S SUSAN.

12:22.042 --> 12:25.075
GREAT. WE DON'T SEE
ENOUGH OF HER.

12:25.075 --> 12:27.878
AND SHE'S NOT ALONE.

12:27.878 --> 12:31.121
HEY, JACKSON. LONG TIME NO SEE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:31.121 --> 12:34.885
UM... WE SORT OF HAVE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

12:36.086 --> 12:38.128
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

12:40.791 --> 12:43.864
OH, MY GOD!

12:43.864 --> 12:46.236
THIS IS SUCH GREAT NEWS!

12:46.236 --> 12:47.367
(chuckles)
 OH!

12:47.367 --> 12:49.800
SO... WHEN'S THE DATE?

12:49.800 --> 12:51.171
MONDAY.

12:51.171 --> 12:54.444
WHOA. W-- (chuckles)
WELL, THAT'S KIND OF SUDDEN.

12:54.444 --> 12:57.147
(chuckles)
WELL, WHEN YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW.

12:57.147 --> 13:00.150
WHY WAIT? (laughs)
 AND WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE
ENGAGEMENT PARTY ON FRIDAY,

13:00.150 --> 13:02.082
AND YOU'RE BOTH INVITED.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.084
A PARTY? COUNT US IN.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.887
I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER REASON
TO... CELEBRATE. (laughs)

13:06.887 --> 13:09.319
HAVE YOU TOLD M.J. YET?

13:09.319 --> 13:11.962
YEAH. HE WAS ON BOARD WHEN HE
FOUND OUT THERE WAS CAKE.

13:11.962 --> 13:13.293
(chuckles)
 OKAY.

13:13.293 --> 13:17.167
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THIS ISN'T
ALL HAPPENING TOO FAST FOR HIM.

13:17.167 --> 13:20.170
YOU KNOW KIDS. THEY NEED
A LITTLE TIME TO ADJUST.

13:20.170 --> 13:22.202
OH, KIDS ARE RESILIENT.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.875
HE'LL BE FINE. I'M SO EXCITED!

13:24.875 --> 13:26.136
(chuckles)

13:27.807 --> 13:31.441
WELL, UH, WE WANTED YOU TWO
TO BE THE FIRST TO KNOW,

13:31.441 --> 13:34.044
AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING.

13:34.044 --> 13:36.216
GOT A FEW MORE NEIGHBORS
TO SHOCK.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.919
OH, WELL, WE ARE JUST
SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.391
YEAH. CONGRATULATIONS.

13:41.391 --> 13:43.193
(chuckles)

13:45.455 --> 13:46.997
(chuckles)

13:51.531 --> 13:55.235
NOW IF WE'RE GOING WITH
THE DAMASK FOR THE SETTEE,

13:55.235 --> 13:59.039
THEN I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT
WE DO THE COUCH IN THE CHENILLE.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.941
MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.974
THE ONLY WORD I UNDERSTOOD
THERE WAS "COUCH."

14:03.974 --> 14:05.976
I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO HIM
LATER.

14:05.976 --> 14:07.978
GOOD, BECAUSE THEY'RE
ONLY GOING TO HOLD THIS FABRIC

14:07.978 --> 14:10.020
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

14:10.020 --> 14:12.022
WELL, I AM OFF.

14:12.022 --> 14:15.125
OHH.
ISN'T THAT VASE DIVINE?

14:15.125 --> 14:17.127
I AM SO GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

14:17.127 --> 14:18.188
(chuckles)

14:18.188 --> 14:21.861
I THOUGHT WE WERE
JUST TRYING OUT THE VASE.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.235
I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO HIM
LATER.
 OKAY.

14:25.235 --> 14:27.497
(Gabrielle) MM-HMM. THANK YOU.

14:27.497 --> 14:30.170
(door opens and closes)

14:30.170 --> 14:32.172
(lowered voice)
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

14:32.172 --> 14:34.444
SEVEN YEARS AGO,
EVELYN DID FRAN'S HOUSE.

14:34.444 --> 14:36.406
NOW? NO HOUSE.

14:36.406 --> 14:39.509
THAT'S CRAZY.
YOU ASK FRAN WHAT HAPPENED?

14:39.509 --> 14:41.881
NO! I DIDN'T WANT
TO EMBARRASS HER.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.184
YOU MET HER IN LINE
FOR FREE SOUP.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.886
HOW MUCH MORE EMBARRASSED
COULD SHE GET?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.119
REMEMBER THAT DINNER PARTY
SHE GAVE?

14:49.119 --> 14:51.591
SHE HAD 20 PLACE SETTINGS
OF TIFFANY CHINA.

14:51.591 --> 14:55.265
HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN TO SOMEONE
WHO HAS TIFFANY CHINA?

14:55.265 --> 14:58.128
THIS IS $200 A YARD.

14:58.128 --> 15:01.231
TELL FRAN TO SAVE US
A PLACE IN LINE.

15:01.231 --> 15:03.203
I BET I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.075
SHE DRANK IT AWAY.

15:05.075 --> 15:07.077
THAT ONE NEW YEAR'S EVE

15:07.077 --> 15:09.940
WHERE SHE GOT SO PLOWED
SHE FELL IN THE KOI POND...

15:09.940 --> 15:12.642
WHERE SHE LANDED ON YOU,
 DRUNKY SUE.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.117
EVERYBODY WAS HAMMERED
AT THAT PARTY.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.549
WELL, THEN IT MUST'VE BEEN
A GAMBLING PROBLEM.

15:19.549 --> 15:22.252
BASED ON WHAT?

15:22.252 --> 15:25.195
SHE NEVER MISSED BINGO NIGHT
AT IMMACULATE HEART...

15:25.195 --> 15:28.058
AND SHE WAS LUTHERAN.

15:28.058 --> 15:30.700
(chuckles) YOU REALLY THINK
SHE BINGO'ED HER HOUSE AWAY?

15:30.700 --> 15:33.633
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
THERE HAS TO BE SOME REASON.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.136
YOU DON'T FALL THAT FAR
THAT FAST

15:36.136 --> 15:38.438
WITHOUT MAKING
SOME REALLY STUPID CHOICES.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.640
WHY YOU GETTIN' SO ANGRY?

15:44.314 --> 15:46.716
(whispers) IT WAS
TIFFANY CHINA, CARLOS.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.689
(laughter,
indistinct conversations)

15:59.689 --> 16:02.993
AHA! THERE'S THE MAN
THAT RUINED MY FISHING TRIP.

16:02.993 --> 16:05.135
SORRY ABOUT THAT, DAVE.
 OH, NO WORRIES.

16:05.135 --> 16:08.438
HEY, I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
AND SUSAN. CONGRATULATIONS.

16:08.438 --> 16:10.140
THANKS.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.142
SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

16:12.142 --> 16:14.144
WE HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE TO TALK SINCE...

16:14.144 --> 16:16.276
I DON'T KNOW,
PROBABLY THE FIRE.

16:16.276 --> 16:19.209
UH, YEAH.
YOU WERE THE BIG HERO.

16:19.209 --> 16:23.183
I WAS THE DOOFUS THAT GOT STUCK
IN THE MEN'S ROOM.
 OH, THAT WAS
A HELL OF A NIGHT.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.455
SURE WOULD LIKE
TO FORGET THAT.
 YEAH, ME, TOO.

16:25.455 --> 16:28.458
UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE TO GO DOWN
AND TALK TO THE COPS ON TUESDAY.
 REALLY?

16:28.458 --> 16:31.461
YEAH. I WENT DOWN TO CITY HALL
TO GET MY MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE,

16:31.461 --> 16:34.424
AND I RAN INTO ONE OF
THE DETECTIVES FROM THAT NIGHT,

16:34.424 --> 16:36.466
AND APPARENTLY, THEY'VE BEEN
TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ME.

16:36.466 --> 16:39.499
SO NOW I GET TO GO DOWN THERE
THE DAY AFTER MY WEDDING.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.171
SOME HONEYMOON, HUH?

16:41.171 --> 16:44.304
WOW. THOSE GUYS REALLY KNOW
HOW TO PUT A CRIMP IN YOUR DAY.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.307
SO DID THEY SAY WHAT THEY WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT?

16:47.307 --> 16:50.610
I GUESS THEY JUST WANNA KNOW
IF I SAW ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.683
HMM. DID YOU?

16:53.683 --> 16:56.516
MM, NO.
I MEAN, I WAS BACKSTAGE.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.350
I WAS HEADED TO THE MEN'S ROOM,
AND I RAN INTO--

17:00.350 --> 17:02.292
(glasses shatter)
 OH! UGH!

17:02.292 --> 17:04.154
I AM SO SORRY.

17:04.154 --> 17:06.356
OH, NO. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

17:06.356 --> 17:08.728
I MEAN, THERE'S GOTTA BE A MOP
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.730
(chuckling)
THAT'S NOT COMING OUT.

17:10.730 --> 17:14.434
OH, BREE CAN GET RID
OF THAT IN A JIFFY.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.267
NOW WHERE DID SHE GO?

17:17.267 --> 17:19.269
(shatters)

17:19.269 --> 17:22.172
(dog barks in distance)

17:22.172 --> 17:23.813
(door rattling)

17:23.813 --> 17:26.215
(unlocks door)

17:26.215 --> 17:28.518
(whispers) OKAY. SHOWTIME.
 (whispers)
WIPE YOUR FEET FIRST.

17:28.518 --> 17:30.520
I JUST HAD
THE CARPETS CLEANED.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.522
(normal voice)
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE THIEVES

17:32.522 --> 17:35.225
DOESN'T MEAN
WE NEED TO BE UNTIDY.

17:40.790 --> 17:42.792
(shoes scraping floor)

17:48.238 --> 17:49.699
(bells jingling)
 ARE WE STEALING THIS?

17:49.699 --> 17:52.071
UH, YES. AS I RECALL,
IT'S QUITE VALUABLE.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.644
WHAT ABOUT THIS?
 OH, GOD, NO.

17:54.644 --> 17:56.706
THAT'S ORSON'S DENTAL INNOVATOR
OF THE YEAR AWARD.

17:56.706 --> 17:58.708
I'VE ALWAYS HATED
THAT THING.

17:58.708 --> 18:00.650
(thud)
 OH, HERE.

18:02.512 --> 18:04.354
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:04.354 --> 18:07.517
I, UH, TOOK SOME OF MY SILVER
OFF THE MANTLE,

18:07.517 --> 18:09.519
AND IT THREW OFF
THE BALANCE.

18:09.519 --> 18:12.262
YEAH.

18:12.262 --> 18:15.165
YOU'RE RIGHT. LET ME HELP.

18:15.165 --> 18:17.167
(clattering)

18:17.167 --> 18:19.529
THERE. BALANCE RESTORED.

18:19.529 --> 18:21.771
WAS THAT NECESSARY?

18:21.771 --> 18:24.774
THIS PLACE HAS TO LOOK LIKE
IT WAS RANSACKED BY ROBBERS,

18:24.774 --> 18:29.339
NOT SOMEONE'S
PERSONAL SHOPPER.
 FINE! BUT DO YOU HAVE TO
DO IT WITH SUCH RELISH?

18:29.339 --> 18:31.341
(metal clanks)

18:31.341 --> 18:34.344
HEY, YOU'RE NOT PAYING ME
TO JUST GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS.

18:34.344 --> 18:37.517
SPEAKING OF WHICH... ARE YOU
NAILING ORSON LIKE WE DISCUSSED?

18:37.517 --> 18:40.220
THAT IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.892
WELL, WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE
HE DOESN'T SUSPECT ANYTHING.

18:42.892 --> 18:45.795
I DO THE BARE MINIMUM.
NO MORE, NO LESS.

18:48.298 --> 18:50.300
SO IS HE JUST MISSIONARY?

18:51.861 --> 18:54.234
HE SEEMS LIKE A STRICTLY
MISSIONARY KIND OF GUY.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.236
MUST YOU BE SO CRUDE?

18:56.236 --> 18:58.638
MUST YOU ALWAYS BE
SUCH A PRISS?

18:58.638 --> 19:00.670
YOU FREAK OUT
AT THE MENTION OF SEX.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.672
YOU NEVER WANT
TO MAKE A MESS.

19:02.672 --> 19:04.844
YOU SUPPRESS EVERY SPONTANEOUS
URGE YOU EVER HAVE!

19:04.844 --> 19:07.517
MAN, IT MUST BE EXHAUSTING
BEING YOU!

19:07.517 --> 19:09.519
YES, BEING A LADY
TAKES EFFORT.

19:09.519 --> 19:12.222
WELL, MAYBE GIVE IT A REST
ONCE IN A WHILE.

19:12.222 --> 19:14.624
IT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU
HOW GOOD IT FEELS.

19:14.624 --> 19:17.327
YOU WANNA BE A NEANDERTHAL,
KARL? THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.

19:17.327 --> 19:19.629
I PREFER TO BEHAVE
WITH CLASS AND DIGNITY.

19:19.629 --> 19:22.462
NOW MAY WE PLEASE FINISH
ROBBING MY HOME?

19:35.445 --> 19:36.546
(clank)

19:36.546 --> 19:41.311
BILL BROWN!

19:41.311 --> 19:43.583
IT'S TOM SCAVO.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.286
TOM! OH, MY GOD!

19:46.286 --> 19:48.288
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:48.288 --> 19:51.291
WELL, JACKSON AND I ARE IN
THE SAME SOCCER LEAGUE.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.263
LYNETTE, THIS IS BILL BROWN.

19:53.263 --> 19:55.265
WE WERE ROOMMATES
FRESHMEN YEAR IN COLLEGE.
 HI.

19:55.265 --> 19:56.696
REALLY?
 YEAH!

19:56.696 --> 20:00.730
GOD, YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.
YOU HAVEN'T AGED A DAY.
 HEY, RIGHT BACK AT YA.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.732
LIAR. YOU DIDN'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE ME.

20:02.732 --> 20:05.235
BACK UP A SECOND.
YOU GUYS WERE CLASSMATES?
 YEAH.

20:05.235 --> 20:07.537
MEANING YOU WERE IN
THE SAME CLASS AT THE SAME TIME?

20:07.537 --> 20:10.340
THAT'S WHAT CLASSMATES MEANS,
LYNETTE. WE'RE THE SAME AGE.

20:10.340 --> 20:11.781
(chuckles)

20:11.781 --> 20:14.284
ACTUALLY, I THINK
I'M SIX MONTHS OLDER.

20:14.284 --> 20:16.316
YOU'RE OLDER?!

20:16.316 --> 20:18.788
I'M SORRY,
I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE...

20:18.788 --> 20:20.320
(chuckles nervously)

20:20.320 --> 20:22.552
THAT THEY'RE OUT
OF STUFFED MUSHROOMS.

20:22.552 --> 20:24.294
EXCUSE ME.

20:24.294 --> 20:26.796
OKAY, MY WIFE'S ANNOYING,
BUT SHE IS RIGHT.

20:26.796 --> 20:29.259
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?
WHAT IS IT? DIET? EXERCISE?

20:29.259 --> 20:31.761
YOU EATIN' A BOWL OF STEM CELLS
EVERY MORNING?

20:31.761 --> 20:34.264
(chuckles)
 COME ON. WHAT'S GOING ON,
PETER PAN?

20:34.264 --> 20:36.536
OKAY...
YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW?

20:38.468 --> 20:40.410
(indistinct conversations)

20:40.410 --> 20:41.541
HI!

20:41.541 --> 20:44.013
THIS IS FOR YOU AND JACKSON.
CONGRATULATIONS! (laughs)

20:44.013 --> 20:47.547
AW, HOW SWEET. OH! AND HEAVY.
(laughs) SCORE.
 (chuckles)

20:47.547 --> 20:49.549
YEAH, WELL, WE CAN AFFORD
TO BE GENEROUS

20:49.549 --> 20:52.482
NOW THAT I'M OFF THE HOOK
FOR ALIMONY.

20:52.482 --> 20:54.354
YEAH. WHAT?

20:54.354 --> 20:55.825
YOU'RE GETTING REMARRIED.

20:55.825 --> 20:57.987
SO I CAN STOP
SENDING THAT CHECK EVERY MONTH.

20:57.987 --> 21:00.860
EVERYBODY GETS A GIFT.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.862
RIGHT!
SCORE FOR YOU! (chuckles)

21:02.862 --> 21:05.865
(chuckles)
 UH, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SEC?

21:05.865 --> 21:07.397
YEAH?

21:07.397 --> 21:10.400
(laughter,
indistinct conversations)

21:11.871 --> 21:13.873
OH, THANK YOU.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.907
YOU GET ALIMONY?

21:17.907 --> 21:20.279
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TOO PROUD
TO TAKE ALIMONY.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.282
I WAS TOO PROUD TO ADMIT IT.
I'M NOT TOO PROUD TO TAKE IT.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.415
I NEED THAT MONEY, JACKSON.

21:25.415 --> 21:27.917
WELL, I-I CAN TRY
TO CHIP IN.
 "CHIP IN"?

21:27.917 --> 21:30.420
IT'S IS NOT A BIRTHDAY CAKE
FOR SHIRLEY IN ACCOUNTING.

21:30.420 --> 21:34.023
IT'S MORTGAGE AND FOOD
AND INSURANCE.

21:34.023 --> 21:36.065
I'M SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T MARRY YOU.

21:36.065 --> 21:38.698
NO, SUSAN,
THEY'LL SEND ME BACK.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.370
IT'S CANADA, NOT IRAN.

21:40.370 --> 21:42.902
IT'S LIKE AMERICA
WITH FREE HEALTH INSURANCE.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.405
OKAY, I KNOW THIS IS
IMPORTANT TO YOU,

21:45.405 --> 21:48.408
BUT I DEPEND ON THAT CHECK
EVERY MONTH.
 AND I KNOW YOU DO.

21:48.408 --> 21:51.381
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I
FINALLY FOUND A JOB THAT I LOVE,

21:51.381 --> 21:54.414
AND NOW I JUST GOTTA
GIVE IT UP.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.916
WELL, LOOK, MAYBE...
I COULD TALK TO MIKE.

21:56.916 --> 21:59.349
I COULD SEE IF WE COULD
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

21:59.349 --> 22:00.750
YOU'D DO THAT?

22:00.750 --> 22:02.852
YEAH, I'LL TRY.

22:02.852 --> 22:05.355
DON'T THINK HE'S NOT GONNA
WANT HIS GIFT BACK.

22:05.355 --> 22:07.357
AND IT'S REALLY HEAVY, TOO.

22:13.463 --> 22:14.704
SO...

22:14.704 --> 22:17.407
YOU THOUGHT MY FRIEND BILL
LOOKED PRETTY FANTASTIC, HUH?

22:17.407 --> 22:19.409
OKAY, I WENT
A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

22:19.409 --> 22:21.411
YOU KNOW ME--TWO MARGARITAS,
AND I NEED A MUZZLE.

22:21.411 --> 22:23.413
NO, I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU.
HE LOOKS REALLY YOUNG.

22:23.413 --> 22:25.415
I KNOW, RIGHT?
HE MUST TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.

22:25.415 --> 22:27.417
ACTUALLY,
HE TOLD ME HIS SECRET,

22:27.417 --> 22:29.118
AND I'M THINKING OF DOING
THE SAME THING.

22:29.118 --> 22:33.052
NO, YOU'RE NOT HAVING
PLASTIC SURGERY.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.424
IT'S MY FACE.

22:34.424 --> 22:36.556
UH, WE LIVE IN
A COMMUNITY PROPERTY STATE,

22:36.556 --> 22:38.558
SO HALF THAT FACE IS MINE.

22:38.558 --> 22:41.561
FINE, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GET THE HALF BELOW THE NOSE.

22:41.561 --> 22:44.664
BUT THESE WRINKLES UP HERE?
ALL GOING AWAY.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.366
(sighs) TOM, MEN DON'T NEED
PLASTIC SURGERY.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.139
THEY LOOK BETTER
AS THEY AGE.

22:50.139 --> 22:51.471
REALLY?

22:51.471 --> 22:53.473
BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T
STOP TALKING

22:53.473 --> 22:55.975
ABOUT HOW GREAT BILL LOOKED.
"YOU GUYS WERE CLASSMATES?

22:55.975 --> 22:58.608
YOU MEAN THE SAME CLASS
AT THE SAME TIME?"

22:58.608 --> 23:01.681
(laughs) OKAY,
THAT'S A LOUSY IMPRESSION OF ME.

23:01.681 --> 23:05.384
LOOK, BILL SAID IT REALLY GAVE
HIM A LEG UP IN JOB INTERVIEWS,

23:05.384 --> 23:07.687
AND I COULD USE THAT
RIGHT NOW.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.689
YOU DON'T NEED A FACE-LIFT.

23:09.689 --> 23:12.391
WHAT IF I WENT OUT
AND GOT A BOOB JOB

23:12.391 --> 23:14.824
AND CAME HOME WITH
BIG, GIANT SIDESHOW BOOBS?

23:14.824 --> 23:16.826
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?

23:16.826 --> 23:19.629
I'D LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT
SOMEHOW.

23:21.471 --> 23:24.734
YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS.
WE CAN'T AFFORD IT!

23:24.734 --> 23:28.077
IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN OUR
FUTURE. WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO.

23:28.077 --> 23:30.580
I'M CALLING THE DOCTOR
AND MAKING AN APPOINTMENT.

23:30.580 --> 23:34.814
IF YOU WANT, I CAN ALSO GET
A PRICE CHECK ON A PAIR OF--
 I'M NOT GETTING A BOOB JOB.

23:39.549 --> 23:41.891
(door unlocks)

23:41.891 --> 23:45.655
WHY DON'T I MAKE YOU
A NICE CUP OF EARL GREY...

23:47.597 --> 23:50.630
OH, DEAR GOD.

23:50.630 --> 23:54.834
(gasps) ORSON,
WE'VE BEEN ROBBED!

23:54.834 --> 23:57.507
IT WASN'T ME. I SWEAR.

24:07.176 --> 24:09.178
(woman) WE NEED MORE SILVERWARE
UP THERE.

24:09.178 --> 24:11.521
NO CUTS!
BACK OF THE LINE.

24:11.521 --> 24:14.654
OH, RELAX. I ALREADY
ATE DINNER AT HOME...

24:14.654 --> 24:17.657
IN MY BOX UNDER THE BRIDGE.

24:19.889 --> 24:21.160
FRAN?

24:21.160 --> 24:24.133
OH, GOD. I WAS AFRAID
I WOULDN'T FIND YOU HERE.

24:24.133 --> 24:26.996
AH, LUCKY YOU,
I'M STILL POOR.

24:26.996 --> 24:29.669
I FEEL BAD I DUCKED OUT
SO FAST THE OTHER DAY.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.671
AND I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU A LOT,

24:31.671 --> 24:33.973
AND I JUST--
I REALLY WANNA HELP.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.975
(sighs)

24:38.147 --> 24:40.910
WOW.

24:40.910 --> 24:42.582
THANK YOU. THANK YOU!

24:42.582 --> 24:44.153
NOW...

24:44.153 --> 24:46.816
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA...

24:46.816 --> 24:48.818
YOU KNOW...

24:48.818 --> 24:51.821
DRINKING WAS NEVER
MY PROBLEM, GABY.

24:51.821 --> 24:55.064
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
YOU WERE ALWAYS SO CLASSY.

24:55.064 --> 24:56.826
20, 40, 60...

24:56.826 --> 24:58.828
(whispers) WAS IT DRUGS?

24:58.828 --> 25:01.200
NO. I NEVER DID DRUGS.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.872
(normal voice)
GOOD TO KNOW.

25:02.872 --> 25:04.173
80, 100.

25:04.173 --> 25:07.176
BECAUSE GAMBLING IS BAD ENOUGH
WITHOUT BEING HIGH.

25:07.176 --> 25:09.879
I NEVER GAMBLED
A DAY IN MY LIFE, GABY.

25:09.879 --> 25:13.212
WELL, THEN WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED?
 (pounds tabletop)

25:13.212 --> 25:15.084
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

25:15.084 --> 25:18.187
I WAS AT YOUR HOUSE.
YOU HAD SUCH LOVELY THINGS.

25:18.187 --> 25:21.090
YES, MARK AND I LIVED
REALLY WELL.

25:21.090 --> 25:23.753
PROBABLY A LITTLE...
TOO WELL.

25:23.753 --> 25:25.224
BUT WE WERE YOUNG,

25:25.224 --> 25:28.227
AND WE THOUGHT WE HAD TIME
TO SAVE FOR THE FUTURE.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.760
THEN HE DIED.

25:30.760 --> 25:34.203
(whispers) MARK DIED?

25:34.203 --> 25:36.205
(normal voice) I DIDN'T KNOW.

25:36.205 --> 25:38.738
HE WAS SICK
A REALLY LONG TIME.

25:38.738 --> 25:41.040
HE COULDN'T WORK.
HE LOST HIS INSURANCE.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.043
BY THE TIME HE PASSED AWAY,
WE WERE COMPLETELY WIPED OUT.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.245
OH, FRAN, I'M SO SORRY.

25:46.245 --> 25:50.179
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY FAMILY
TO TURN TO? ANY FRIENDS?

25:50.179 --> 25:54.183
NO FAMILY, AND AS IT TURNS OUT,
NOT TOO MANY FRIENDS EITHER.

25:54.183 --> 25:57.226
LOOK, GABY,
I KNOW YOU CAME HERE

25:57.226 --> 26:00.289
WANTING TO FIND OUT WHAT I DID
TO MAKE THIS ALL HAPPEN.

26:00.289 --> 26:03.262
BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE'RE ALL
JUST AN ACCIDENT OR A TUMOR

26:03.262 --> 26:05.264
OR A BAD INVESTMENT AWAY
FROM...

26:05.264 --> 26:08.197
(voice breaks)
STANDING IN LINE FOR FREE SOUP.

26:08.197 --> 26:09.338
THANK YOU.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.604
I DON'T AGREE, FRAN.

26:19.248 --> 26:22.281
YOU KNOW, CARLOS WENT BLIND
FOR FIVE YEARS.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.984
WE WENT BROKE.
WE ALMOST LOST OUR HOUSE.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.987
BUT WE WORKED OUR ASSES OFF
AND WE MADE IT BACK.

26:27.987 --> 26:31.661
OH, SO JUST BECAUSE
YOU SURVIVED THAT,

26:31.661 --> 26:34.163
YOU THINK YOU'VE CROSSED
SOME KIND OF FINISH LINE,

26:34.163 --> 26:36.265
THAT NOTHING BAD
CAN HAPPEN AGAIN?

26:36.265 --> 26:38.297
WELL, NO, BUT--
 LISTEN.

26:38.297 --> 26:41.000
I HOPE IT WORKS OUT FOR YOU.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.774
I HOPE YOU NEVER LOSE THAT
BIG, BEAUTIFUL HOME OF YOURS.

26:44.774 --> 26:48.007
GOD KNOWS I WISH I'D APPRECIATED
MINE MORE WHILE I HAD IT.

26:52.381 --> 26:55.244
THANK YOU AGAIN.

27:11.260 --> 27:15.234
REMIND ME AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE
GETTING YOUR TEETH CLEANED.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.837
UM... THE 14th.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.839
AND THE 15th,
WE HAVE TICKETS

27:19.839 --> 27:22.341
TO THAT PLAY
THAT YOU'RE DRAGGING ME TO.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.673
YES. WHY?

27:23.673 --> 27:26.175
I'M JUST--I'M TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

27:26.175 --> 27:29.178
WHEN WOULD BE A GOOD TIME
TO GET MARRIED.

27:29.178 --> 27:31.851
I'M SORRY.
WHAT DID YOU JUST...

27:31.851 --> 27:33.322
I KNOW, I KNOW.

27:33.322 --> 27:36.025
NOT THE MOST ROMANTIC PROPOSAL
IN THE WORLD.

27:36.025 --> 27:39.028
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LED
WITH THE TEETH CLEANING.

27:39.028 --> 27:41.691
I FEEL I CAN OVERLOOK THAT.

27:41.691 --> 27:44.063
SO IS THAT A YES?

27:44.063 --> 27:46.665
YES! (laughs) IT'S A YES!

27:46.665 --> 27:47.897
OH!

27:47.897 --> 27:49.238
(laughs)

27:49.238 --> 27:52.201
WOW! WHAT BROUGHT THIS ON?

27:52.201 --> 27:54.744
IT JUST SEEMED
LIKE THE RIGHT TIME.

27:54.744 --> 27:56.906
OH, MIKE.

27:56.906 --> 27:58.908
I'M SO HAPPY. (giggles)
 (chuckles)

27:58.908 --> 28:00.950
I LOVE YOU.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.687
(both speaking inaudibly)

28:10.219 --> 28:12.221
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

28:15.464 --> 28:17.366
(spritzing)

28:17.366 --> 28:19.368
I UNDERSTAND TAKING THINGS,

28:19.368 --> 28:22.832
BUT WHY SMASH SOMETHING
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE BEHIND?

28:22.832 --> 28:25.975
(chuckles) THEY'RE ROBBERS,
DEAR. NOT PERSONAL SHOPPERS.

28:25.975 --> 28:28.277
YEAH, WELL, WHOEVER DID THIS
SHOULD BE SHOT.

28:28.277 --> 28:30.980
WELL, I WONDER IF THE VICTIMS
OF YOUR KLEPTOMANIA

28:30.980 --> 28:34.113
FELT THE SAME WAY.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.746
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

28:36.746 --> 28:39.248
I NEVER REALIZED WHAT
MY STEALING PUT PEOPLE THROUGH.

28:39.248 --> 28:40.920
MAYBE THIS IS KARMA.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.391
WHAT IS THAT?

28:42.391 --> 28:44.023
OH.

28:44.023 --> 28:47.757
IT'S A PICTURE OF THE MASK
THEY STOLE.

28:47.757 --> 28:50.099
I DREW IT FROM MEMORY.

28:50.099 --> 28:52.101
WOW.

28:52.101 --> 28:54.233
HMM.
REMEMBER WHERE WE GOT IT?

28:54.233 --> 28:55.935
WAS IT FLORENCE?

28:55.935 --> 28:57.266
VENICE.

28:57.266 --> 28:59.769
WE WALKED PAST THAT LITTLE SHOP
UNDER THE BRIDGE,

28:59.769 --> 29:01.370
AND YOU SAW IT IN THE WINDOW.

29:01.370 --> 29:03.412
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

29:03.412 --> 29:04.743
MM.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.416
YOU TOLD ME YOU'D BEEN
WEARING A MASK ALL YOUR LIFE,

29:07.416 --> 29:09.418
BUT WITH ME, YOU FELT--

29:09.418 --> 29:12.421
LIKE I COULD FINALLY
TAKE IT OFF AND BE MYSELF.

29:12.421 --> 29:14.253
(chuckles)
 YEAH.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.385
(mouths word)

29:16.385 --> 29:18.788
ANYWAY, I FAXED IT
TO THE SHOP IN VENICE.

29:18.788 --> 29:20.790
THEY SAID THEY COULD
MAKE A NEW ONE.

29:20.790 --> 29:23.392
I SHOULD HAVE IT FOR YOU
IN ABOUT A MONTH.

29:23.392 --> 29:25.764
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WENT
TO ALL THAT TROUBLE

29:25.764 --> 29:28.767
THEN YOU MUST NOT KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU MEAN TO ME.

29:36.175 --> 29:39.478
(telephone rings)

29:39.478 --> 29:41.250
(ring)

29:41.250 --> 29:42.351
(beep)

29:42.351 --> 29:44.413
HELLO? OH, HI, DAVE.

29:44.413 --> 29:46.916
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

29:46.916 --> 29:49.919
WELL, I FIGURED IT WAS TIME
TO GET BACK TO WORK,

29:49.919 --> 29:52.421
SO I PUT TOGETHER
A SPEAKING TOUR--

29:52.421 --> 29:54.493
SEATTLE, PORTLAND,
MY USUAL ROUTE.

29:54.493 --> 29:58.968
WORK? ARE YOU SURE
IT'S NOT TOO SOON?
 Well, I have to do it
eventually.

29:58.968 --> 30:00.269
ANYWAY, I WAS HOPING

30:00.269 --> 30:03.132
YOU COULD CHECK IN
ON THE HOUSE NOW AND THEN.

30:03.132 --> 30:05.134
OF COURSE.
 (knock on door)

30:05.134 --> 30:08.137
OH, SOMEONE'S AT MY DOOR.
LET ME GET RID OF THEM.

30:10.539 --> 30:12.541
HEY, KATHERINE,
IS MIKE HERE?

30:12.541 --> 30:15.114
NO, HE'S AT WORK.
 OH, SHOOT. UM...

30:15.114 --> 30:18.888
WELL, CAN YOU TELL HIM TO CALL
ME AS SOON AS HE GETS BACK?
 SURE.

30:18.888 --> 30:20.049
(sighs)

30:20.049 --> 30:22.451
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

30:22.451 --> 30:24.023
UH, WELL...

30:25.424 --> 30:28.397
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? MIKE'S
PROBABLY GONNA TELL YOU ANYWAY,

30:28.397 --> 30:31.030
SO JUST DON'T TELL
ANYONE ELSE, OKAY?

30:31.030 --> 30:33.332
THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM
WITH THE WEDDING, IS THERE?

30:33.332 --> 30:35.504
IT'S STILL ON, RIGHT?

30:35.504 --> 30:38.367
IT DEPENDS.

30:38.367 --> 30:40.539
JACKSON AND I
ARE ONLY GETTING MARRIED

30:40.539 --> 30:42.411
BECAUSE HE NEEDS
HIS GREEN CARD.

30:42.411 --> 30:44.513
OH.

30:44.513 --> 30:47.516
AND THEN I REALIZED
THAT I WOULD LOSE MY ALIMONY.

30:47.516 --> 30:50.349
SO UNLESS MIKE WILL KEEP
PAYING ME, I CAN'T GET MARRIED.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.381
YOU HAVE TO.

30:52.381 --> 30:54.253
I MEAN, POOR JACKSON.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.887
I-I WOULD HATE TO SEE HIM
DEPORTED BACK TO...

30:57.887 --> 31:00.890
WHERE'S HE FROM?
 CANADA.

31:00.890 --> 31:04.233
OH! OH! BRR!
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT!

31:04.233 --> 31:07.366
IF YOU WANT,
I COULD TALK TO MIKE FOR YOU.
 THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.969
JUST TELL HIM
I NEED AN ANSWER QUICKLY

31:09.969 --> 31:11.971
'CAUSE THE WEDDING IS MONDAY.

31:11.971 --> 31:15.874
WELL, DON'T CANCEL ANYTHING YET.
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR ANSWER TONIGHT.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.406
THANKS.

31:24.954 --> 31:27.456
SORRY, DAVE.

31:27.456 --> 31:28.988
DAVE?

31:30.319 --> 31:32.321
(beep)

31:32.321 --> 31:35.124
(chuckles)

31:44.473 --> 31:45.634
HEY.
 (telephone ringing)

31:45.634 --> 31:48.407
HEY, LYNETTE.
HOW'S IT GOING?

31:48.407 --> 31:51.410
OH, MY HUSBAND WANTS
TO SPEND MONEY WE DON'T HAVE

31:51.410 --> 31:53.682
ON A FACE-LIFT HE DOESN'T NEED,
SO... NOT GREAT.

31:53.682 --> 31:56.085
MM, TELL HIM TO BE CAREFUL.

31:56.085 --> 31:58.387
HAVE YOU SEEN
BRUCE IN PAYROLL?

31:58.387 --> 32:01.450
HE JUST WENT IN
FOR A LITTLE NIP AND TUCK.

32:01.450 --> 32:03.953
AND? HOW'S HE LOOK?

32:03.953 --> 32:06.956
LIKE HE'S STANDING
IN A WIND TUNNEL.

32:06.956 --> 32:08.958
REALLY?
 MM-HMM.

32:08.958 --> 32:10.429
POOR BRUCE.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.031
YEP.

32:14.463 --> 32:16.135
WHAT'S HIS EXTENSION?

32:16.135 --> 32:19.268
AND I'M THINKING
I MAY HAVE ACTED RASHLY.

32:19.268 --> 32:22.541
I MEAN, EVERY MARRIAGE HAS
ITS ROUGH PATCHES.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.544
ORSON LOVES ME,
AND DEEP DOWN, HE'S A GOOD MAN.

32:25.544 --> 32:28.547
IF I STICK WITH THIS,
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT WORK.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.549
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING
TO ME?

32:30.549 --> 32:33.152
DON'T NEED TO.
HEARD IT ALL BEFORE.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.453
OH, REALLY?

32:34.453 --> 32:37.256
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
20 YEARS.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.358
AND TRUST ME,

32:39.358 --> 32:41.390
EVERY WOMAN GETS COLD FEET.

32:41.390 --> 32:44.393
(ice cubes clink)
 "AM I MAKING A MISTAKE?"

32:44.393 --> 32:46.395
"WAS HE REALLY THAT BAD?"

32:46.395 --> 32:49.498
"MAYBE I COULD TRY HARDER."

32:49.498 --> 32:52.441
AND I'M GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT I TELL THEM--

32:52.441 --> 32:54.443
YOU'RE NOT MAKING A MISTAKE.

32:54.443 --> 32:56.445
HE REALLY IS THAT BAD.

32:56.445 --> 32:59.078
(opens drawer)
 AND NO MATTER
HOW HARD YOU TRY,

32:59.078 --> 33:01.150
HE'S STILL GONNA BE
THE SAME JERK

33:01.150 --> 33:04.153
WHO SENT YOU INTO THIS OFFICE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

33:04.153 --> 33:06.155
OH. SO I'M JUST LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE,

33:06.155 --> 33:08.217
AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
I'M GOING TO SAY.

33:08.217 --> 33:09.358
YEP.

33:09.358 --> 33:13.192
I EVEN KNOW THE STUFF
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAY.

33:13.192 --> 33:15.064
I DOUBT THAT.

33:15.064 --> 33:17.496
LET ME GIVE IT A SHOT.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.498
(pours liquid)
 YOU'VE BEEN THINKING,

33:19.498 --> 33:22.171
"WHAT HAPPENS IF
I WALK AWAY FROM ORSON

33:22.171 --> 33:25.634
AND EVERYTHING I INVESTED
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP?"

33:28.477 --> 33:32.181
"WILL I EVER FIND
ANOTHER MAN?"

33:34.483 --> 33:38.187
WILL YOU SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE ALONE?

33:40.689 --> 33:42.591
CLOSE?

33:45.354 --> 33:47.756
IN THE BALLPARK.

33:50.359 --> 33:52.431
WELL, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.433
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

33:57.706 --> 34:01.070
YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL,
ELEGANT, CLASSY WOMAN,

34:01.070 --> 34:04.343
AND THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE GONNA END UP ALONE.

34:12.781 --> 34:15.484
AND DO YOU SAY THAT
TO EVERY WOMAN, TOO?

34:15.484 --> 34:16.824
NO.

34:16.824 --> 34:19.527
I MEAN, I GET SOME REAL UGGOS
IN HERE.

34:19.527 --> 34:21.830
YOU KNOW, THE KIND
THAT ARE GONNA DIE ALONE

34:21.830 --> 34:25.333
AND GET EATEN BY THEIR CATS.
(chuckles)

34:25.333 --> 34:26.594
CHARMING.

34:26.594 --> 34:30.339
SO ARE WE BACK IN BUSINESS?

34:30.339 --> 34:34.342
SEND ME THE PAPERS
WHEN THEY'RE READY.

34:34.342 --> 34:38.746
(door opens and closes)

34:41.110 --> 34:43.112
HONEY, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

34:43.112 --> 34:46.114
I BROUGHT SOMEONE HOME FROM WORK
I WANT YOU TO MEET.
 (groans) W--

34:46.114 --> 34:49.118
OHH.
 YEAH. IT TURNS OUT
HE GOT THE SAME PROCEDURE

34:49.118 --> 34:51.489
THAT YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT GETTING.

34:51.489 --> 34:54.763
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD
CHAT HIM UP ABOUT IT.
 SO YOU'RE FINALLY
ON BOARD WITH THIS?

34:54.763 --> 34:56.795
WELL, LIKE YOU SAID,
IT'S YOUR FACE.

34:56.795 --> 35:00.529
COME ON, I'M DYING FOR YOU
TO MEET BRUCE.

35:04.373 --> 35:06.875
BRUCE, I WANT YOU TO MEET
MY HUSBAND TOM.

35:06.875 --> 35:08.677
TOM, THIS IS BRUCE.

35:08.677 --> 35:12.811
HI, TOM.

35:12.811 --> 35:16.415
SO, UM, LYNETTE TELLS ME

35:16.415 --> 35:19.388
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HAVING
A LITTLE ELECTIVE SURGERY.

35:19.388 --> 35:22.151
DID SHE?
 MM-HMM.

35:22.151 --> 35:26.295
NOW YOU MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO TELL,

35:26.295 --> 35:28.857
BUT I'VE HAD WORK DONE.

35:28.857 --> 35:32.631
REALLY? (chuckles nervously)
HAVE THEY FINISHED?

35:32.631 --> 35:35.404
YEAH.
 (Lynette chuckles)

35:35.404 --> 35:38.667
NOW I SHOULD WARN YOU
THAT, UH...

35:38.667 --> 35:41.470
AFTER THEY OPERATE,
IT LOOKS A LITTLE WEIRD.

35:41.470 --> 35:44.142
OH, I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT THAT. YEAH.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.745
BUT EVENTUALLY IT SETTLES,
LIKE THIS.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.577
MM.

35:51.450 --> 35:54.823
(sighs)

35:56.455 --> 35:58.427
ISN'T IT EXCITING, TOM?

35:58.427 --> 36:01.490
IN A FEW WEEKS, YOU ARE GONNA
LOOK JUST LIKE BRUCE.

36:03.732 --> 36:07.636
HEY, IF YOU WANT, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE NAME OF MY SURGEON.

36:07.636 --> 36:11.300
YES. I DEFINITELY WANT THE NAME
OF THE GUY WHO DID THAT.

36:11.300 --> 36:14.343
LYNETTE, UM, BRUCE LOOKS LIKE
HE COULD USE SOMETHING TO DRINK,

36:14.343 --> 36:16.645
AND I KNOW THAT I SURE COULD.

36:16.645 --> 36:19.548
C-COULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A SEC? (laughs)

36:22.881 --> 36:25.784
VERY CLEVER, LYNETTE--INVITING
THE JOKER OVER TO SCARE ME.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.787
I WANTED YOU TO SEE THE FACE
THEY DON'T PUT IN THE BROCHURE.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.790
I WILL BE HAVING MY WORK DONE
BY A REPUTABLE SURGEON.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.293
BRUCE LOOKS LIKE
HIS WAS DONE BY A BEAR.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.595
(laughs) THAT'S MY POINT.
 (liquid pours)

36:36.595 --> 36:39.568
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
THESE THINGS WILL TURN OUT.
 (sets down bottle)

36:39.568 --> 36:42.571
WELL, I AM WILLING TO TAKE
THAT RISK. I'M DOING IT.

36:42.571 --> 36:44.703
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO STUBBORN?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.905
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?

36:46.905 --> 36:50.579
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
PLASTIC SURGERY.

36:50.579 --> 36:51.740
WHAT?

36:51.740 --> 36:55.544
TOM, IF YOU'RE UNSATISFIED
WITH YOUR LOOKS,

36:55.544 --> 36:59.288
SOMEDAY YOU'RE GONNA
BE UNSATISFIED WITH MINE.

36:59.288 --> 37:00.489
NO.

37:00.489 --> 37:01.990
NO.
 YES.

37:01.990 --> 37:05.894
YOU ARE GOING TO LOOK AT ME
SOMEDAY WITH YOUR BRAND-NEW FACE

37:05.894 --> 37:08.627
AND SAY,
"WHEN DID SHE GET SO OLD?"

37:08.627 --> 37:12.531
WE WON'T LOOK LIKE
WE BELONG TOGETHER ANYMORE.

37:12.531 --> 37:15.904
LYNETTE, I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT
GETTIN' RID OF A FEW WRINKLES.

37:15.904 --> 37:17.906
BUT I DON'T SEE
YOUR WRINKLES, TOM.

37:17.906 --> 37:19.908
I SEE OUR WHOLE LIFE
TOGETHER.

37:21.510 --> 37:23.912
THIS...

37:23.912 --> 37:28.547
IS YOU WORRYING ABOUT HOW
YOU'RE GOING TO PROVIDE FOR US.

37:28.547 --> 37:31.520
THIS IS PENNY
FALLING OUT OF THE TREE HOUSE

37:31.520 --> 37:33.652
AND BREAKING HER ARM.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.525
THIS IS MY CANCER.

37:38.727 --> 37:41.430
THESE ARE
THE MILLIONS OF LAUGHS

37:41.430 --> 37:43.732
THAT GOT US THROUGH
ALL THOSE TOUGH TIMES.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.767
IT'S LIKE
A MAP OF OUR MARRIAGE,

37:48.767 --> 37:51.670
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE IT.

37:51.670 --> 37:54.373
AND IT IF KEEPS ME
FROM GETTING A JOB?

37:56.405 --> 37:59.007
YOU'RE GONNA GET A JOB,

37:59.007 --> 38:01.980
AND IT'LL BE BECAUSE THEY'RE
IMPRESSED BY YOUR EXPERIENCE,

38:01.980 --> 38:03.982
NOT YOUR WRINKLE-FREE FACE.

38:03.982 --> 38:07.586
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
YOU MEAN.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.658
AND I LOVE YOUR FACE, TOO.

38:09.658 --> 38:11.460
MMM.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.492
MMM.

38:13.492 --> 38:16.325
AND THIS WRINKLE HERE,
THAT'S WHEN--

38:16.325 --> 38:19.628
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME, TOM.

38:19.628 --> 38:22.631
COME ON. MWAH.

38:24.333 --> 38:26.535
(cell phone alert beeps)

38:29.608 --> 38:31.079
HEY.

38:31.079 --> 38:32.611
GOOD NEWS.

38:32.611 --> 38:34.983
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GETTING
FAKE MARRIED AFTER ALL.

38:34.983 --> 38:37.386
REALLY?
 YEAH.

38:37.386 --> 38:40.549
MIKE AGREED TO KEEP PAYING ME
ALIMONY. HE JUST SENT ME A TEXT.

38:40.549 --> 38:43.392
OH, MAN. THAT'S A RELIEF.
 (cell phone beeps)

38:43.392 --> 38:44.853
AND UNBELIEVABLY GENEROUS.

38:44.853 --> 38:48.096
I'M GONNA SEND HIM
A THANK-YOU RIGHT NOW.

38:48.096 --> 38:51.059
(alert chimes)

38:51.059 --> 38:54.102
(Katherine) YOU'RE WELCOME.

38:54.102 --> 38:56.405
(hits button)

38:56.405 --> 38:57.866
(hits button)

39:12.551 --> 39:15.053
YOU KNOW,
I REALLY CAN'T TELL YOU

39:15.053 --> 39:18.126
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE
YOU DOING THIS FOR ME, SUSAN.

39:18.126 --> 39:20.589
AND I PROMISE,
AS LONG AS I'M HERE,

39:20.589 --> 39:22.591
I'LL PITCH IN AROUND THE HOUSE,
RUN ERRANDS.

39:22.591 --> 39:24.733
YOU KNOW,
JUST LIKE A REAL HUSBAND.

39:24.733 --> 39:26.895
(chuckles) CLEARLY, YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN MARRIED BEFORE.

39:26.895 --> 39:30.038
WELL, YOU KNOW,
JUST BECAUSE THIS IS, UM...

39:30.038 --> 39:33.001
A FAKE MARRIAGE, DOESN'T MEAN
IT CAN'T BE WONDERFUL.

39:33.001 --> 39:36.004
WELL, I'VE BEEN IN SOME
REAL MARRIAGES THAT WEREN'T,

39:36.004 --> 39:38.947
SO... MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:42.150 --> 39:45.153
(rattling)

39:46.885 --> 39:49.518
(chuckles) OH, LOOK. CANS.

39:49.518 --> 39:52.060
YOU CAN'T HAVE A WEDDING
WITHOUT CANS AND SIGNAGE!

39:52.060 --> 39:53.662
SWEET! (laughs)

39:53.662 --> 39:56.665
LET'S GET TO THE CAR WASH
ON OUR WAY TO THE COURTHOUSE.
 MM-HMM.

39:58.166 --> 39:59.668
(tires screech)

40:01.630 --> 40:02.601
JACKSON BRADDOCK?

40:02.601 --> 40:03.702
YES?

40:03.702 --> 40:05.874
WE'RE WITH IMMIGRATION.

40:05.874 --> 40:08.036
YOU'RE IN THE COUNTRY
ON AN EXPIRED VISA.

40:08.036 --> 40:10.539
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
COME WITH US.
 OH, NO, NO, NO.

40:10.539 --> 40:13.542
YOU--YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM NOW.
 MA'AM,
I NEED YOU TO STEP BACK.

40:13.542 --> 40:15.514
SUSAN, THERE'S A BUSINESS CARD
ON THE DRESSER

40:15.514 --> 40:17.846
WITH AN ATTORNEY'S NUMBER. WOULD
YOU CALL HIM FOR ME, PLEASE?

40:17.846 --> 40:21.750
PLEASE, CAN'T THIS WAIT?
WE'RE ABOUT TO GET MARRIED.
 NOT TODAY YOU'RE NOT.

40:21.750 --> 40:24.453
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHO ARE THESE GUYS?
 UH... IMMIGRATION AGENTS,

40:24.453 --> 40:26.455
AND I THINK THEY'RE...
 (car door shuts)

40:26.455 --> 40:28.457
SENDING JACKSON BACK TO CANADA.

40:46.174 --> 40:49.778
(cell phone rings)

40:49.778 --> 40:53.582
(ring)

40:53.582 --> 40:55.654
(beep)

40:55.654 --> 40:58.657
HELLO?
 (woman) May I speak
with, uh, Bree Van De Kamp?

40:58.657 --> 41:01.530
OH, SHE'S NOT IN AT THE MOMENT.
CAN I TAKE A MESSAGE?

41:01.530 --> 41:03.992
Uh, yeah, this is Sheila
with Weston Brothers Storage.

41:03.992 --> 41:06.995
It's about the storage unit
she just rented.
 STORAGE UNIT?

41:06.995 --> 41:08.997
Uh, yeah, we overcharged her
on the deposit.

41:08.997 --> 41:10.999
Tell her not to worry.

41:10.999 --> 41:13.001
We're gonna deduct it
from her next bill.

41:13.001 --> 41:15.003
OKAY. UH, THANK YOU.
 You're welcome.

41:15.003 --> 41:16.505
(beep)

41:18.647 --> 41:21.980
EVERYONE WEARS
SOME KIND OF MASK,

41:21.980 --> 41:23.982
SO YOU MUST LOOK CLOSELY

41:23.982 --> 41:27.756
TO FIND THE TRUTH
THAT LIES BENEATH.

41:27.756 --> 41:28.757
(keys jangle)

41:28.757 --> 41:30.889
HI. MWAH.
 (door opens)

41:30.889 --> 41:35.964
SOME CONCEAL ANXIETY
ABOUT GROWING OLDER.

41:39.568 --> 41:43.231
SOME HIDE FEARS
OF FINANCIAL RUIN.

41:47.706 --> 41:50.178
(gasps, laughing)

41:50.178 --> 41:55.544
OTHERS COVER UP A LOVE
THAT CONTINUES TO LINGER.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.118
(door creaks)

42:02.020 --> 42:06.194
AND THEN THERE ARE THOSE
WHO LET THEIR MASKS SLIP.

42:11.059 --> 42:13.101
IF YOU LOOK INTO THEIR EYES,

42:13.101 --> 42:16.605
YOU'LL SEE
WHO THEY REALLY ARE...

42:16.605 --> 42:22.140
AND EXACTLY WHAT
THEY'RE CAPABLE OF.
