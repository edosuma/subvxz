YAAH!

00:18.440 --> 00:20.640
Ace: A MINI MASTODON.

00:20.670 --> 00:23.270
NOW THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T SEE EVERY DAY.

00:23.310 --> 00:25.810
Lexi: YEAH, WELL,
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

00:25.840 --> 00:28.510
MASTODONS ESCAPE FROM
THE RETRO PETTING ZOO.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.180
Ace: AND THIS ONE'S
GOING RIGHT BACK IN.

00:31.220 --> 00:33.780
LOONATICS, LET'S JET.

00:37.720 --> 00:38.760

00:53.500 --> 00:55.670
Lexi: GOTCHA.

00:55.710 --> 00:57.810
I'LL JUST MAKE A LITTLE DEPOSIT
BACK AT THE ZOO.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.480
WE BETTER
CORRAL THAT ELEPHANT

01:02.510 --> 01:04.710
BEFORE HE MISTAKES SOMEONE
FOR A PEANUT.

01:04.750 --> 01:07.480
TECHNICALLY
IT'S A GENETICALLY CREATED

01:07.520 --> 01:10.850
MINIATURE MASTODON
FROM THE MESOZOIC ERA.

01:10.890 --> 01:14.120
OK, SO IT'S

01:58.500 --> 02:01.840

ARE GONE, GUYS,

05:02.650 --> 05:06.020
AND IT'S EVIDENT
THEY DIDN'T BREAK OUT.

05:06.060 --> 05:08.830
THEY WERE DELIBERATELY RELEASED.

05:08.860 --> 05:11.060
Lexi: AND I HAVE
A SNEAKING SUSPICION

05:11.090 --> 05:13.700
I KNOW JUST THE CREEP
WHO DID IT.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.830
THE QUESTION IS WHY.

05:16.870 --> 05:18.670
HUH?

05:18.700 --> 05:20.740
Rev: OURS IS NOT TO REASON WHY.

05:20.770 --> 05:22.540
OURS IS BUT TO STOP
THOSE GENETICALLY RECREATED

05:22.570 --> 05:24.770
SEMI-MINIATURIZED
PREHISTORIC SPECIMENS BEFORE

05:24.810 --> 05:26.440
THEY DO MAJOR DAMAGE TO THE
INFRASTRUCTURE

05:26.480 --> 05:28.410
OF THE METROPOLIS.

05:28.450 --> 05:30.110
Ace: EXACTLY.

05:30.150 --> 05:33.420
DUCK, YOU GET SLAM
AND CATCH THAT CAT.

05:33.450 --> 05:36.050
WE'LL ROUND UP
THE RUNAWAY REPTILES.

05:36.090 --> 05:39.420
YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.
SEND A BIRD TO CATCH A CAT.

05:44.790 --> 05:49.970
Duck: COME ON, SLAM.
TIME TO KICK PREHISTORIC BUTT.

05:52.670 --> 05:56.970
MONSIEUR SLAM, I SAW YOU
FIGHT ZEE MASTODON.

05:57.010 --> 05:58.440

05:59.710 --> 06:01.450
AND HOW YOU SAY?

06:01.480 --> 06:03.010

EWW.

06:31.240 --> 06:33.540
UN MOMENT, MON AMI.

06:33.580 --> 06:38.780
I AM WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL
ZEE PROMOTER OF ZEE FIGHTING.

06:38.820 --> 06:43.750
IT IS VERY TRAGIC THAT YOU
WERE NEVER ZEE CHAMPION BEFORE,

06:43.790 --> 06:47.560
HOW YOU SAY, ZEE METEOR,

06:47.590 --> 06:52.530
BUT DO I HAVE
A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

06:52.560 --> 06:56.200
Duck: YO, SLAM!
LITTLE HELP HERE.

06:56.230 --> 06:58.070
YOU CAN BE
ZEE GREATEST CHAMPION

07:00.140 --> 07:03.170
Duck: AAH. OH, SLAM.

07:03.210 --> 07:07.040
AND YOU WILL MAKE
SO MUCH MONEY.

07:11.210 --> 07:15.020
CH-CHING. DID I JUST
HEAR THE "M" WORD?

07:23.060 --> 07:25.660
SORRY, SMILEY.
PLAYTIME'S OVER.

07:28.300 --> 07:34.700
YOU WILL BE, HOW YOU SAY,
UH, FILTHY RICH.

07:34.740 --> 07:36.570
HE'S ALREADY FILTHY, BUB.

07:36.610 --> 07:39.240
HE LOOKS HOW YOU SMELL. HA HA.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.110
BUT SERIOUSLY, TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THE RICH PART.

07:42.150 --> 07:45.680
WHAT'S IT TO YOU, LE DUCK?

07:45.720 --> 07:48.620
I'M HIS MANAGER.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.720
I'LL JUST TAKE
THE STANDARD CUT, OF COURSE.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.760
WE'LL SPLIT IT 90-10.

07:55.790 --> 07:59.030
YOU DON'T NEED MORE
THAN 10%, DO YOU?

08:00.200 --> 08:01.970
I-I'M JUST KIDDING.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I-I'LL GIVE YOU 20.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.100
IF MONSIEUR SLAM

08:07.140 --> 08:11.310

OF ZEE MAX ARENA--

08:11.340 --> 08:16.850
HEH HEH--HE WILL HAVE
VERY, VERY MUCH MONEY.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.080
MMM.

08:18.110 --> 08:20.920
CHAMPION.

08:20.950 --> 08:22.290
MMM.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.150
MONEY.

08:25.190 --> 08:29.860
Ace: SLAM, A LITTLE
CYCLONE ACTION MIGHT BE HELPFUL.

08:29.890 --> 08:31.960
SLAM?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.260
HEY, WHERE IS SLAM AND DUCK?

08:34.300 --> 08:38.070
THAT KITTY CAT SHOULD'VE
BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BY NOW.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.970
IF YOU WILL JUST SIGN THIS,

08:41.000 --> 08:46.610
I WILL MAKE YOU ZEE GREAT STAR
LIKE YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.050
AHEM. I'LL SIGN THAT.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.290
AND VOILA. WE HAVE ZEE DEAL.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.100
AND THAT SHOULD DO IT.

09:10.130 --> 09:13.140
RECESS IS OVER, GERTIE.

09:13.170 --> 09:16.870
I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
TO SLAM AND DUCK.

09:16.910 --> 09:20.010
ACCORDING TO MY PERIMETER
COORDINA-TRIANGULATER,

09:20.040 --> 09:24.780
THEY'RE WITHIN 1.3 KILOMETERS.

09:24.810 --> 09:26.280
I HOPE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

09:28.420 --> 09:31.190
AND NOW, MES AMIS,

09:31.220 --> 09:35.890
WE GO TO ZEE MAX ARENA.

09:35.930 --> 09:38.960
WHERE IS THIS ZEEMAX ARENA?

09:39.000 --> 09:43.900
IT IS EVERYWHERE AND NOWHERE,

09:43.930 --> 09:47.670
CONSTANTLY MOVING, ZOOM ZOOM.

09:47.700 --> 09:50.210
THEN HOW ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO GET THERE?

09:50.240 --> 09:55.140
THERE ARE ONLY 2 WAYS
TO GET INTO ZEE MAX ARENA--

09:55.180 --> 10:00.150
WITH A TICKET
OR WITH A CONTRACT.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.190
Ace: THERE THEY ARE.

10:02.220 --> 10:05.090
HEY, THAT'S THE DUDE I SAW
OUTSIDE THE RETRO ZOO.

10:09.130 --> 10:13.660
IT APPEARS THAT HE'S FINISHED
RELEASING THE ANIMALS.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.770
YEAH. NOW HE'S
COLLECTING 'EM.

10:43.960 --> 10:47.830
Pierre: THIS IS ZEE MAX ARENA.

10:47.860 --> 10:53.170
BY TONIGHT, IT WILL BE FILLED
WITH CHEERING FANS

10:53.200 --> 10:57.270
WHO HAVE PAID VERY MUCH MONEY.

10:57.310 --> 10:58.940
MAYBE IF I
MAKE ENOUGH MONEY,

10:58.980 --> 11:02.850
I CAN BUY
SOME OF YOUR LOVELY COLOGNE.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.080
EHH. BLECH. BLEHH.

11:09.820 --> 11:12.260
Ace: OOH.
SOMETHING SMELLS FISHY.

11:12.290 --> 11:16.130
HMM. MORE LIKE A SKUNK
IF YOU ASK ME.

11:16.160 --> 11:19.360
Tech: I'M DETECTING TRACES
OR GORDONIUM.

11:19.400 --> 11:23.500
THAT MEANS SOME SORT OF
TELEPORTATION DEVICE WAS USED.

11:23.530 --> 11:26.240
CAN YOU TRACK 'EM
TO WHERE THEY WERE TELEPORTED?

11:26.270 --> 11:28.270
CHILD'S PLAY.

11:28.300 --> 11:31.370
LEAVE THE OVERCOMPLICATED
THINKING TO ME.

11:44.090 --> 11:46.160
YAH! THAT'S IT.

11:46.190 --> 11:48.260

HOO! HARDER.

11:57.070 --> 11:59.770

12:18.990 --> 12:21.090

13:02.600 --> 13:04.370
OWW!

13:04.400 --> 13:06.340

14:01.020 --> 14:04.030

PIERRE LePEW

16:03.680 --> 16:07.620
SEE, BUDDY? ONE MORE,

16:09.750 --> 16:11.990
I DON'T KNOW. TO THE FINISH.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.390
Lexi: THAT'S HIM

16:18.430 --> 16:21.460
Ace: FREEZE-FRAME.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.400
Tech: I'VE INPUT HIS IMAGE

16:24.430 --> 16:27.240
LET'S HOPE THERE'S A MATCH.

16:35.210 --> 16:36.780
Lexi: GOT HIM.

16:36.810 --> 16:40.320
ACCORDING TO THIS,

THE HEAD OF THE ILLEGAL EXTREME
ULTIMATE INTERGALACTIC

16:44.190 --> 16:47.220
ONLY-ONE-FIGHTER-COMES-OUT-
OF-IT-ALIVE FEDERATION.

16:47.260 --> 16:50.830
NOT THE E-T-U-I-
DOUBLE O-F-C-DOUBLE O-I-A-F!

16:50.860 --> 16:55.760
HE PROBABLY KIDNAPPED SLAM
AND MADE HIM FIGHT.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.370
I'VE HEARD ABOUT
THOSE ILLEGAL FIGHTS.

16:58.400 --> 17:02.540
THEY TAKE PLACE IN THIS FLOATING
ARENA THAT'S CONSTANTLY MOVING.

17:02.570 --> 17:04.610
IT COULD BE ANYWHERE.

17:04.640 --> 17:08.180
THE RUMORS ABOUT THOSE FIGHTS
ARE AWFUL.

17:08.210 --> 17:13.480
THEY FIGHT UNTIL--WELL, UNTIL...

17:13.520 --> 17:15.280
THE LOSER KICKS THE BUCKET,

17:17.290 --> 17:18.720

18:51.450 --> 18:56.220
UH-UH-UH. TOO TINY.

18:56.250 --> 18:59.390
ARE YOU KIDDING?
DON'T YOU WANNA BE A CHAMPION?

18:59.420 --> 19:02.360
DON'T YOU WANNA MAKE HISTORY,

19:02.390 --> 19:04.530
MAKE ME RICH?

19:04.560 --> 19:09.400

19:14.440 --> 19:18.610
Lexi: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, REV.
WE'VE CIRCLED THE GLOBE.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.780

19:21.810 --> 19:23.780
THEN BACK TO JUNGLONIA,
NOW HERE?

19:23.810 --> 19:26.220

YOU CAN TAKE THAT TO THE BANK.

19:30.850 --> 19:34.590
Ace: SO WHERE IS
THIS FLOATIN' ARENA?

19:34.620 --> 19:36.430
IT SHOULD BE ARRIVING
AT THESE PRECISE COORDINATES

19:36.460 --> 19:38.890
IN EXACTLY 3.4 SECONDS.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.300
Tech: THAT WAS NOT
PRECISELY 3.4 SECONDS.

19:45.330 --> 19:47.000
Rev: ACTUALLY IT WAS
3.4 SECONDS

19:47.040 --> 19:48.800
IF YOU ADJUST
FOR THE TIME-SPACE SHIFT.

19:48.840 --> 19:51.770
Tech: THERE ARE DEFINITE
TRACES OF GORDONIUM

19:51.810 --> 19:53.580
IN THIS FORCE FIELD.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.280
Rev: THAT MEANS
WE CAN TELEPORT INSIDE

19:55.310 --> 19:57.010
BY TRANSFORMING
THE GORDONIUM ELEMENTS

19:57.050 --> 19:59.450
INTO TRANSMUTABLE
ENERGY BEAMS, AND--

19:59.480 --> 20:01.380
Ace: GREAT.
HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE?

20:01.420 --> 20:06.290
IT WILL TAKE
PRECISELY 12.67 SECONDS.

20:06.320 --> 20:11.030
THAT'LL GIVE US JUST ENOUGH
TIME FOR A LITTLE PRESTO CHANGO.

20:11.060 --> 20:15.630
Pierre: AND NOW YOU ARE IN
FOR ZEE FIGHT OF ZEE MILLENNIUM,

20:15.660 --> 20:20.740

21:09.990 --> 21:12.390
UH-OH.

21:19.730 --> 21:21.060
THAT WAS DEFINITELY,
POSITIVELY,

21:21.100 --> 21:24.900
NOT EVEN
REMOTELY 12.67 SECONDS.

21:24.930 --> 21:29.440
REV, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
DRESSED AS A FAN, NOT A YODELER.

21:32.710 --> 21:35.410
OOH, POOR SLAM
IS GETTING CLOBBERED.

21:47.690 --> 21:50.460
OHH HO. I CAN'T LOOK.

21:53.630 --> 21:55.760
PSST, HEY, DUCK.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.430
I'VE NO TIME FOR PESKY FANS.

21:58.470 --> 22:00.640
I'M IN MOURNING
FOR A LOST BANKROLL.

22:00.670 --> 22:02.140
YOU'LL BE IN MOURNING
FOR MORE THAN THAT

22:02.170 --> 22:04.710
IF YOU DON'T GET SLAM
OUT OF THERE.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.380
ACE!

22:06.410 --> 22:08.080
YOU CAN HELP ME SAVE MY MONEY.

22:08.110 --> 22:10.080
Lexi: FORGET ABOUT
THE MONEY, DUCK.

22:10.110 --> 22:13.620
DON'T YOU KNOW THIS IS A FIGHT
TO THE FINISH?

22:13.650 --> 22:17.390
YEAH, AND SLAM IS
JUST ABOUT FINISHED.

22:23.130 --> 22:24.890
SLAM'LL CREAM HIM
IN THE REMATCH.

22:24.930 --> 22:29.000
THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE
A REMATCH.

22:29.030 --> 22:31.470
THIS FIGHT ISN'T OVER
UNTIL THE FAT LADY SINGS

22:31.500 --> 22:33.170
OR ONE OF THEM
BECOMES WORM FOOD,

22:33.200 --> 22:35.000
GIVES UP THE GHOST,
BUYS THE FARM,

22:35.040 --> 22:38.470
PUSHES UP THE DAISIES,
STEPS OFF THE CURB, SAVVY?

22:38.510 --> 22:41.610
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I GET IT.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.780
WHAT ARE YOU DRESSED FOR,
YODELING CONTEST?

22:46.520 --> 22:52.050
Ace: WE GOTTA GET IN THERE
AND STOP THIS.

22:52.090 --> 22:56.390
OK, LOONATICS, HIT HIM HARD.

23:10.870 --> 23:14.810
COME ON, SLAM.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.180
NO QUIT.

23:17.210 --> 23:19.680
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND,
SLAM.

23:19.720 --> 23:23.220
ONLY ONE OF YOU
CAN LEAVE ALIVE.

23:23.250 --> 23:27.720
NO, NO, NO, MY PRETTY ONE.
THAT IS NOT QUITE TRUE.

23:27.760 --> 23:33.760
ONLY ONE OF THE 6 OF YOU
CAN LEAVE ALIVE.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.500
WELL, WE'RE ALL
GETTIN' OUT OF HERE,

23:41.540 --> 23:46.140
AND NOTHIN'S GONNA STOP US.

23:46.170 --> 23:48.810
WELL, PRACTICALLY NOTHING.

23:50.210 --> 23:52.010
ATTACK!

23:56.120 --> 23:58.720
STAND BACK. THE REV RUNNER
EXPRESS IS COMIN' THROUGH.

23:58.750 --> 24:01.060
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN HIT
THE ULTIMATE MOVING TARGET.

24:01.090 --> 24:05.260
HERE I AM. NO, OVER HERE.

24:05.290 --> 24:07.660
MISSED ME.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.030

24:09.060 --> 24:10.800
HEY!

24:10.830 --> 24:14.940
THIS TIME,
LET'S REALLY GET HIM.

24:14.970 --> 24:18.170
UH-UH. NO.

24:18.210 --> 24:20.940
HEY, WHAT'S HE UP TO?

24:30.120 --> 24:32.220
IT'S BRILLIANT.

24:32.250 --> 24:34.260
GORLOP IS SOME SORT
OF ENERGY EATER.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.600
WOW, SLAM, THAT WAS
AN ABSOLUTELY INSPIRED STRATEGY.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.670
WE MADE HIM SO BIG
THAT HE HIT THE FORCE FIELD

24:49.710 --> 24:51.610
AND ABSORBED ALL ITS ENERGY
AND OVERLOADED.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.710
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE YODELING.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.210
DON'T.

25:02.890 --> 25:08.960
OH, SLAM,
YOU ARE A TASMANIAN GENIUS.

25:08.990 --> 25:12.630
YOU HAVE,
HOW YOU SAY, RUINED ME.
