Gloria,
what are you doin'?
I'm just trying to help.

01:08.567 --> 01:12.003
You wanna help?
I'll tell you how you
can help. Don't help!

01:12.071 --> 01:15.707
Michael, I just wanted
to say that I don't think
you should be worried...

01:15.775 --> 01:18.977
About the problem
that's been happening
between us lately.

01:19.045 --> 01:21.146
Worried?
Do I look worried?

01:21.213 --> 01:23.915
Well, I'm not... worried.

01:23.983 --> 01:28.419
Michael, I understand.
No, you don't, Gloria.

01:28.487 --> 01:32.123
If you understood, you'd know
that the last thing I wanna hear
is you saying, "I understand."

01:32.191 --> 01:34.325
I understand.

01:34.393 --> 01:37.628
Gloria! Please,
I'm trying to work!
Will you leave me alone?

01:37.697 --> 01:39.630
Okay!

01:43.502 --> 01:46.171
Gloria!
What's the matter?

01:46.238 --> 01:48.173
Nothing!

01:48.240 --> 01:51.309
Yes, there is.
I can tell.
No, nothing.

01:51.376 --> 01:55.246
Oh, come on. Come on.
You can tell me.

01:55.314 --> 01:58.549
Ma, did you ever wonder
if daddy stopped loving you?

01:58.617 --> 02:01.419
Is that what's
bothering you?

02:01.486 --> 02:04.655
You think your father
don't love me no more?

02:06.092 --> 02:10.061
No, ma. It's not daddy
I'm thinking about.
It's Michael.

02:10.128 --> 02:15.600
Michael?
Why wouldn't Michael
love me no more?

02:15.667 --> 02:19.470
No, ma.
The problem's between
Michael and me.

02:19.538 --> 02:22.741
Ohh.
Well, what is it?

02:24.576 --> 02:28.113
Ma, you know I can't
tell you about
a sexual problem.

02:28.180 --> 02:30.815
Sexual?
Yes!

02:33.919 --> 02:35.854
Can I?

02:41.593 --> 02:43.527
Why not?

02:46.198 --> 02:51.669
I mean, I'm your mother,
and if you have
a problem about s--

02:53.472 --> 02:55.940
something to do with...

02:57.042 --> 03:01.512
One of those problems,
you can tell me.

03:01.580 --> 03:05.216
All right.
It's Michael.

03:05.284 --> 03:08.787
You see... lately
we've been apart.

03:08.854 --> 03:10.789
Why?

03:10.856 --> 03:13.958
Well, lately he
hasn't been able to--

03:17.229 --> 03:20.064
you see?
I can't tell you.

03:20.132 --> 03:24.402
Oh, Gloria, I'm sorry.
It's crazy.

03:24.469 --> 03:26.905
The longer it goes on,
the more worried he gets,

03:26.972 --> 03:30.608
and the more
guilty about himself
and the more angry at me.

03:30.676 --> 03:35.313
Oh, well, don't worry.
I'm sure it'll be all right.

03:35.380 --> 03:38.783
I have a call in to Dr. Kermit.
Maybe he'll know what's wrong.

03:38.851 --> 03:41.953
Oh, sure. He'll know.

03:42.021 --> 03:45.790
It's probably just something
that's goin' around.

03:52.932 --> 03:55.266
Ho-ho-ho and whoop-de-doo.

03:57.502 --> 04:02.406
First time in years a subway
ride turned out to be fun,
and no thanks to the city.

Comin' home on the subway,
who do you think I bump into
on the train?

04:06.478 --> 04:10.648
A guy I ain't seen in 36 years.
Bummy fensel was his name.

04:10.716 --> 04:13.151
Funniest little kid
in the neighborhood.

04:13.219 --> 04:16.786
He was always runnin' around
with droopy drawers
and wet under the nose.

04:16.856 --> 04:22.760
And I wanna tell you
what he used to do.
He'd eat anything for money.

04:22.828 --> 04:25.964
We used to give him two cents.
He'd eat a fly.

04:26.031 --> 04:28.599
For three cents,
he'd eat a half a worm.

04:28.667 --> 04:33.471
Hey. Hey, are you
listenin' to me?
Hey, meathead!

04:33.538 --> 04:36.374
Oh, were you
talkin' to me, arch?

04:36.441 --> 04:39.244
[ Mockingly ]
Was I talkin' to you?

04:39.311 --> 04:42.446
Well, I thought I was.
There ain't nobody else here.
Edith!

04:42.514 --> 04:45.083
- I'm studyin'.
- Aw, go on. Studyin'.

04:45.150 --> 04:49.720
I come home with one of
the funniest antidotes
of all time,

04:49.788 --> 04:54.658
a story with some real human
interest in it, and you sit
there like you're an accountant.

04:57.662 --> 05:01.299
Hello, Archie.
Dinner's all ready.

05:01.367 --> 05:06.604
Yeah, well, first you
oughta tell the captain of
the Polish unemployment team...

05:07.672 --> 05:09.974
To get his books
off of this table!

05:10.042 --> 05:15.613
Well, actually, Archie,
I thought you wouldn't mind
eating in the kitchen tonight.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.182
Oh, you thought that,
huh, Edith?

05:18.250 --> 05:22.686
Yeah, you see, his big
final exams is tomorrow.

05:22.754 --> 05:25.924
Well, my dinner
is tonight!

05:25.991 --> 05:28.659
Now, come on,
meathead.
Let's move it, huh?

05:28.727 --> 05:31.362
Daddy, doesn't Michael
have any rights around here?

05:31.430 --> 05:34.665
He certainly does.
He has the right to know
what I am about to say.

05:34.733 --> 05:36.867
Get the hell out
of the dining room!

05:39.571 --> 05:43.474
No, Michael.
You stay where you are.
You sit right there and study.

05:43.542 --> 05:47.378
Hey! Since when do you
start orderin' me around?

05:47.446 --> 05:50.982
I am not ordering you around.
Would you stop being
so sensitive?

05:51.050 --> 05:53.318
I will when you stop
being so hostile!

05:53.385 --> 05:55.987
Aw, will youse both dummy up?
Edith, I want my dinner.

05:56.055 --> 05:59.790
I am not being hostile!
Yes, you are! What do you
call coming in here--

05:59.858 --> 06:02.893
hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey!

06:02.962 --> 06:05.696
Put a lid on it, will ya?

06:05.764 --> 06:07.865
I don't wanna hear
no more arguin'.

06:07.933 --> 06:10.468
The only sound
I wanna hear is the sound
of dinner being served...

06:10.535 --> 06:13.004
On this here table
in this here dining room.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.440
That's fine with me.
I don't have to study
here anymore.

06:15.507 --> 06:18.676
What are you saying?
I decided it's
too tough for me, Gloria.

06:18.743 --> 06:22.146
I'm gonna quit college
and get a job.
Oh, Michael, don't be childish.

06:22.214 --> 06:24.415
Let him be childish!
Be childish!

06:24.483 --> 06:26.985
Daddy, you be quiet.
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

06:27.052 --> 06:29.687
Oh, oh! Now I've
lost my mind too, huh?

06:29.754 --> 06:33.024
Well, you must have!
What kind of job do you
figure to get without a degree?

06:33.092 --> 06:36.861
Well, I don't care! What's the
difference? I'll drive a truck,
pump gas, collect garbage!

06:36.928 --> 06:41.366
Bingo! Start collectin'
the garbage off the table here!

06:41.433 --> 06:45.103
Is that all you want, arch?
You just want this stuff
off the table?

06:45.170 --> 06:49.140
Well, why didn't you
just say so?
Michael, no!

06:49.208 --> 06:51.442
<i>[ Phone rings ]</i>
<i>I'll get it!</i>
<i>That's for me!</i>

06:51.510 --> 06:54.745
Don't anybody touch it!
Did you hear what I said?
Don't answer that phone!

06:54.813 --> 06:56.747
Michael, get your books
back on this table,

06:56.815 --> 07:00.218
and, daddy,
you eat in the kitchen,
or I'll kill myself!

07:02.121 --> 07:04.922
Oh, come on, Archie.

07:04.990 --> 07:07.525
It won't be so bad
in the kitchen.

07:07.592 --> 07:12.796
Remember Arthur?
He used to eat in
the kitchen all the time.

07:12.864 --> 07:15.699
Arthur?
Arthur was a cat.

07:20.239 --> 07:23.674
What is goin' on?
I feel like an outcast
in my own home.

07:23.742 --> 07:26.010
What the hell are they
fightin' about out there?

07:26.078 --> 07:30.281
We're gonna have
a nice pot roast,
and as a special added treat,

07:30.349 --> 07:32.450
kosher pickles...

07:32.518 --> 07:35.586
Cut in four pieces,
just the way you like 'em.

07:35.654 --> 07:39.390
Well, that ain't the way
I like 'em. I like 'em cut
in four pieces lengthwise.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.392
These here
are crosscuts.

07:43.462 --> 07:45.763
And what's the problem
with them two?

07:45.830 --> 07:50.068
Well, Archie, I don't know
the whole story, but--

07:50.135 --> 07:55.706
oh, I just can't tell you.
You just don't like to hear
about such things.

07:55.774 --> 07:58.142
I like to hear
about everything that's
goin' on in this house.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.545
Now, what kind of
a problem have they got?

08:00.612 --> 08:03.281
[ Clicks tongue ]
Well...

08:03.348 --> 08:05.283
It's sexual.

08:05.350 --> 08:07.285
Shush!

08:14.393 --> 08:16.527
You know I don't
like to hear nothin'
about that there.

08:19.498 --> 08:22.233
You better hear
about this, Archie.

08:23.802 --> 08:27.105
Well... all right.
You can tell me.

08:27.172 --> 08:29.107
But start slow.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.643
Don't put in
nothin' extra, see?

08:33.812 --> 08:36.679
And I'll say "stop"
when I know what it is.

08:40.751 --> 08:43.453
Well--

08:43.522 --> 08:47.325
you remember you once
told me about a fella,

08:47.392 --> 08:50.294
petey Simpson,
who came back from the war--

08:50.362 --> 08:52.597
stop! I know what it is.

08:55.167 --> 08:59.203
- And he wasn't able to--
- stop! I know what it is.

09:04.709 --> 09:06.677
Mm-hmm.

09:06.745 --> 09:11.182
Oh, nah, Edith.
Oh, yeah.
Gloria told me.

09:12.251 --> 09:14.252
And she was there.

09:20.325 --> 09:23.261
Oh, Edith, it can't be.

09:23.328 --> 09:26.096
There's nothing wrong
with him like that.
I mean, look at him.

09:26.165 --> 09:32.036
He's healthy there. He's strong.
Geez, he goes through groceries
like an earth remover.

09:32.103 --> 09:34.038
Wait a minute. Shh.

09:57.996 --> 10:00.464
Thank you. Bye-bye.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.538
Michael?
All right.
Leave me alone.

10:07.606 --> 10:09.540
No! Now, calmly.

10:09.608 --> 10:13.211
We have to discuss this
openly, intelligently
and calmly.

10:13.278 --> 10:15.846
You said calmly twice!
Damn it!
Would you let me finish?

10:15.914 --> 10:18.449
Aha! That doesn't sound
calmly to me, Gloria.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.851
Now, the phone call
I just got was from
Dr. Kermit.

10:20.919 --> 10:23.821
Now, I asked him
about your problem--
you what?

10:23.888 --> 10:26.524
All I wanted to do--
Gloria,
without telling me?

10:26.592 --> 10:29.293
That's not the kind of thing
I want spread all over town,
you know!

10:29.361 --> 10:33.897
Gee whiz!
Oh, boy. I'm glad you're
taking such a mature attitude.

10:33.965 --> 10:37.201
Well, Gloria, if the shoe
were on the other foot,
what would you do?

10:37.269 --> 10:41.105
I'd forget my enormous
male ego and want to know
what the doctor said.

10:41.172 --> 10:45.209
Who cares what the doctor said?
Maybe you care, but I don't.

10:45.277 --> 10:47.712
What did he say?

10:47.779 --> 10:50.648
He said this sort of,
uh, problem...

10:50.716 --> 10:55.286
Is often caused by anxiety--
like a man worried about
his job, for example.

10:55.354 --> 10:58.155
Yeah?
Yeah, or a student
worried about his exams.

10:58.223 --> 11:03.461
So tomorrow, when your exams are
over and the anxiety disappears,
so will the problem.

11:04.963 --> 11:07.265
Yeah, but how can
you be sure?
Well, chances are--

11:07.332 --> 11:11.001
oh, well, chances are,
chances are. That's so--
would you be reasonable?

11:11.069 --> 11:14.204
The man can't give you
a written guarantee.

11:14.273 --> 11:17.040
Then what good is he?

11:17.108 --> 11:20.110
Gloria, I need
that guarantee!

11:20.178 --> 11:24.181

gonna do about the kids?

11:24.249 --> 11:27.918

11:29.388 --> 11:31.322

And from now on,

All right?
You look very nice, dear.

13:06.117 --> 13:09.353
But that ain't the same dress
you had on five minutes ago.

13:09.421 --> 13:12.690
I know, ma, but Michael
thinks the other dress
is the sexiest one I have,

13:12.758 --> 13:15.959
and the last thing I wanna do
is put any pressure on him.

youse two, huh?

a little real peace and quiet.

Edith. Who is Sybil gooly?

14:00.071 --> 14:05.509
Well, she's the checker
at the third counter
at ferguson's market.

14:05.577 --> 14:08.979
Oh, someone near
and dear to us all.

14:10.949 --> 14:13.717
Listen, I get what
you're tryin' to do.

14:13.785 --> 14:17.087
Meathead's exams are over.
He's comin' home, huh?

14:17.155 --> 14:21.024
You and Gloria got it all
hatched up so that they can
have the house alone tonight.

14:21.092 --> 14:25.062
Archie,
you're so smart.
Aw, come on!

14:25.129 --> 14:29.266
You don't have to soft-soap me
to get me outta here. I can
leave the house on my own hoof.

14:29.334 --> 14:34.137
Where are you goin'?
Where am I goin'? I'm goin'
down to kelcy's saloon,

14:34.205 --> 14:36.941
where the only problem
is closin' time.

14:38.543 --> 14:43.246
You can go and enjoy yourself
with Sybil gooly
and her gallstones.

14:45.851 --> 14:48.218
He says to me,
"Archie, keep your money.

14:48.286 --> 14:51.254
For old times' sake,
I'll do it for nothin'!"

14:52.323 --> 14:54.257
Hey, arch.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.795
What are you doin' here?
Somethin' the matter at home?

14:57.863 --> 15:02.633
I haven't been home yet.
You ain't been home yet?
Then what am I doin' here?

15:02.701 --> 15:05.736
I wanted to talk to you, arch.
You know, in private.

15:05.804 --> 15:09.874
Oh, well, now, listen. If it's
what I think it is, I oughtn't
be the one to talk to.

15:09.941 --> 15:12.543
You go home by yourself
and work it out.

15:12.611 --> 15:15.546
But that's just it, arch.
I'm scared of goin' home.

15:15.614 --> 15:17.715
It's like facin'
another exam.

15:19.484 --> 15:23.453
Arch, why can't you
give me the benefit of
an older man's experience?

15:23.522 --> 15:25.623
Lay off my experience!

15:27.492 --> 15:30.861
Arch, I'm worried about
somethin' real important to me.
Why can't you help me out?

15:30.929 --> 15:35.566
Because you're never worryin'
about somethin' normal.

15:35.634 --> 15:39.369
Like, what are
the New York jets gonna do
about Joe namath's knee?

15:39.437 --> 15:43.273
Think about that.
All your worries are weirdo.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.578
That's what you call
what's botherin' me,
a weirdo worry?

15:47.646 --> 15:50.948
Well, what would
you call it?
Well, it's anxiety.

15:51.016 --> 15:55.953
Aww, geez!
Yeah, it's like Dr. Kermit said,
anxiety over exams.

15:56.021 --> 15:59.222
It ain't got nothin'
to do with anxiety.

15:59.290 --> 16:01.926
You're just nervous,
that's all.

16:05.496 --> 16:10.634
Your exams went and they
took your mind off
certain things.

16:10.702 --> 16:13.403
Now, listen.
This is what you gotta do.

16:13.471 --> 16:15.873
Before you go
to sleep at night,

16:15.941 --> 16:20.778
sit down and say to yourself,
"is there anything else
that I forgot to do?"

16:30.722 --> 16:34.458
You could even write
yourself a little note.
Maybe that would help.

16:36.461 --> 16:40.097
That's ridiculous!
Well, you asked me,
didn't you?

16:41.466 --> 16:44.568
Keep it down.

16:44.636 --> 16:49.106
All I'm sayin' is,
before you go to bed
just look around,

16:49.173 --> 16:52.943
see what's there...
Read your note!

16:56.380 --> 16:58.983
Thanks, arch.
You've been a great help.

16:59.050 --> 17:02.419
Hey, Tommy,
could you fill this up
with some draft, please?

17:02.487 --> 17:04.421
Sure.
Hi, Mike.
Hi, bunker.

17:04.489 --> 17:09.693
Hi, Mr. Jefferson.
Oh, hi there, Jefferson.
Uh, say-- excuse me, will ya?

17:09.761 --> 17:11.762
Say, uh,
Jefferson, there,

17:13.098 --> 17:17.001
can I talk to you over here
about, uh, some business?

17:17.068 --> 17:19.136
Oh, sure, sure.
[ Clears throat ]

17:22.373 --> 17:24.842
What's up?
Well, this is
kinda private,

17:24.909 --> 17:28.411
and it's a little bit,
you know, delicate.

17:28.479 --> 17:33.684
I got this friend of mine,
and he's got what you call
"connubible" difficulties.

17:38.723 --> 17:43.226
That means he's a married man,
but the trouble with him is
that he can't, uh--

17:43.294 --> 17:46.296
he's, uh--
he's stuck in neutral.

17:56.607 --> 17:58.542
I got you.

18:02.647 --> 18:08.285
It's a well-known fact
that youse people--
I mean, the men--

18:11.422 --> 18:14.758
I mean, when it
comes to members
of the opposite, uh,

18:14.826 --> 18:17.094
you got a special kind
of "stanima."

18:17.162 --> 18:22.232
You know what I mean?
Oh, yeah. I hear we're very
advanced in that department.

18:23.601 --> 18:26.403
Yeah, well,
that's why I come
to you for help, see?

18:26.470 --> 18:29.439
Oh, I don't know, bunker.
I don't know if I can
tell ya that.

18:29.507 --> 18:33.210
I mean, it's such
a well-guarded racial secret.

18:36.314 --> 18:39.783
Come on. Come on.
I mean, what does it for you?

18:39.851 --> 18:42.786
You can tell me.
I won't tell nobody else.

18:42.854 --> 18:45.989
I mean,
we're neighbors, ain't we?
We're practically friends.

18:48.659 --> 18:51.394
Yeah, practically.

18:51.462 --> 18:55.199
Yeah, well, now, uh,
I hear tell that, uh,

18:55.266 --> 18:58.301
there's somethin'
in that soul food
youse are always eatin'...

18:58.369 --> 19:00.370
That gives you
a lot of moxie.

19:02.006 --> 19:04.474
You hit it
right on the button.
I did?

19:04.542 --> 19:09.079
Well, now that you guessed it,
I might as well tell you.
It's the--

19:12.016 --> 19:14.251
it's the hog jowls.
Hog jowls?

19:16.454 --> 19:19.289
Now, here's what
you wanna do.

19:19.357 --> 19:23.994
Try a jowl in the morning
and a jowl at night,
and you'll be just fine.

19:24.062 --> 19:28.799
Oh, listen.
I almost forgot to tell ya
about the side effects.

19:28.867 --> 19:31.969
Side effects?
Oh, yeah. Listen,
you start in with them jowls,

19:32.036 --> 19:35.438
and you might develop
a sudden craving to shine shoes.

19:40.178 --> 19:43.847
You might even get an urge
to run down to the airport
and start carryin' bags.

19:43.915 --> 19:46.917
Listen, I even heard
of one extreme case...

19:46.985 --> 19:50.187
Where a man tap-danced
himself to death.

19:52.924 --> 19:55.525
Here you go. Good night,
Tommy. Night, Mike.
Good night.

19:56.694 --> 19:59.129
Night, bunker.
I hope you're feelin' better.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.969
I don't see how you're
gonna help them people.
They never talk serious.

20:10.408 --> 20:12.943
And what about you?
Are you still sittin' here?

20:13.011 --> 20:16.246
Why don't you go home?
I'll go home
when I'm ready.

20:16.314 --> 20:20.550
I'm just not ready.
Well, you got a wife home.
Don't you never think about her?

20:20.618 --> 20:24.822
Archie, you kiddin' me?
That's all I been thinkin'
about, night and day.

20:24.889 --> 20:27.390
Thinkin' about her now?
Sure!

20:27.458 --> 20:29.559
Then you're ready.
Go home.

20:39.170 --> 20:41.104
Hey, Tommy.
Yeah?

20:41.172 --> 20:43.406
Let me ask you somethin'.
Sure.

20:43.474 --> 20:45.809
What do you know...

20:45.877 --> 20:48.411
About hog jowls?

20:51.649 --> 20:55.219
Gloria, I'm goin' now.

Hi there, Gloria.

I'm so glad the exams
went well.
Oh, yeah. Me too.

21:30.321 --> 21:33.090
I, uh, think I
passed everything.

21:33.157 --> 21:36.626
Good.
All the anxieties are gone.

21:36.694 --> 21:40.264
Then again,
I might not have passed.

21:40.331 --> 21:44.667
Uhh--
poor baby.
You must be exhausted.

21:44.735 --> 21:47.637
Yeah. Yeah, I-I am.
I'm-- I'm tired, Gloria.

21:47.705 --> 21:50.340

very tired.

and go to sleep.

21:53.278 --> 21:55.578
I'm not that tired.

21:55.646 --> 21:59.749
I think I'll just
sit down here for a while
and watch a little tv.

21:59.817 --> 22:02.286
But you never watch tv.

22:02.353 --> 22:06.323
Yeah, well, tonight
there's a special movie
I've been dying to see.

22:06.391 --> 22:10.027
What?
Uhh--

22:10.094 --> 22:12.862
well, it was
in here yesterday.

sound great?

help you relax.

have to do that, Gloria.

No, no.
