00:14.200 --> 00:17.600
<i> Every year</i>
<i>for just a few short months…</i>

00:19.240 --> 00:23.160
<i>…fresh water flows</i>
<i>into the Okavango Delta…</i>

00:27.680 --> 00:29.280
<i>creating the perfect home</i>…

00:31.360 --> 00:33.480
<i>for a small family of elephants…</i>

00:38.000 --> 00:42.280
<i>and a playground</i>
<i>for their two young calves…</i>

00:44.520 --> 00:45.600
<i>Bosigo…</i>

00:47.680 --> 00:50.760
<i>…and her baby cousin, Metsi.</i>

00:59.440 --> 01:03.680
<i> Bosigo and Metsi</i>
<i>are only just beginning</i>

01:03.760 --> 01:05.400
<i>their love affair with water.</i>

01:09.000 --> 01:10.320
<i>But from now on,</i>

01:11.200 --> 01:13.720
<i>their lives will be defined by it.</i>

01:15.960 --> 01:19.000
<i>This one precious molecule…</i>

01:21.400 --> 01:22.720
…<i>delivered to Earth…</i>

01:25.400 --> 01:29.640
<i>…by the astonishing forces</i>
<i>at work in our universe.</i>

01:36.200 --> 01:38.560
<i>It has transformed this planet…</i>

01:41.760 --> 01:42.920
…<i>into a haven…</i>

01:48.600 --> 01:49.560
…<i>for life.</i>

02:26.200 --> 02:27.720
<i>Summer has arrived.</i>

02:30.360 --> 02:34.200
<i>And what was paradise is no more.</i>

02:37.360 --> 02:39.840
<i>The fresh water that flooded the delta…</i>

02:42.800 --> 02:44.760
<i>only stays for a few months.</i>

02:46.720 --> 02:48.800
<i>And water holes are now vanishing.</i>

02:50.520 --> 02:51.360
<i>Fast.</i>

02:58.520 --> 03:00.320
<i>This means only one thing</i>

03:00.400 --> 03:03.640
<i>for the thousands of elephants</i>
<i>who've been living here.</i>

03:06.240 --> 03:08.080
<i>It's time to move on.</i>

03:21.960 --> 03:26.120
<i>This has been the only home</i>
<i>Metsi and Bosigo have ever known.</i>

03:28.720 --> 03:32.200
<i>But in a few weeks,</i>
<i>all the water will be gone.</i>

03:36.160 --> 03:40.000
<i>So they must leave the delta</i>
<i>with the rest of their family.</i>

03:41.160 --> 03:43.120
<i>A herd of females,</i>

03:43.200 --> 03:46.200
<i>sisters, aunts, and cousins,</i>

03:48.080 --> 03:49.680
<i>led by their grandmother,</i>

03:50.760 --> 03:53.520
<i>the great matriarch, Pula.</i>

03:58.360 --> 04:02.440
<i>They're embarking on a journey</i>
<i>along with thousands of other families…</i>

04:05.160 --> 04:06.400
<i>out into the desert…</i>

04:10.280 --> 04:11.600
<i>in search of water.</i>

04:18.840 --> 04:20.480
<i>For the next eight months,</i>

04:20.560 --> 04:24.840
<i>they will migrate</i>
<i>from water hole to water hole…</i>

04:27.320 --> 04:30.160
<i>and navigate ancient elephant trails</i>…

04:31.200 --> 04:33.920
…<i>using the matriarch Pula's knowledge,</i>

04:35.320 --> 04:37.640
<i>handed down to her through generations.</i>

04:40.480 --> 04:43.040
<i>The trek will put all their lives at risk.</i>

04:45.080 --> 04:48.720
<i>And they'll need</i>
<i>every one of their exceptional senses</i>…

04:48.800 --> 04:51.120
-…<i>to endure the dangers.</i>

04:55.640 --> 04:58.840
<i>Making this journey is not a choice.</i>

05:04.640 --> 05:07.080
<i>Without water, they will die.</i>

05:11.320 --> 05:13.880
<i>Even on our blue planet,</i>

05:13.960 --> 05:16.960
<i>fresh liquid water is scarce.</i>

05:20.160 --> 05:23.400
<i>And if we search beyond the shores</i>
<i>of our own planet…</i>

05:25.480 --> 05:27.000
<i>it's rarer still.</i>

05:30.320 --> 05:32.880
<i>Even the most arid desert on Earth</i>

05:33.640 --> 05:38.240
<i>is nothing compared</i>
<i>to the rest of our solar system.</i>

05:41.560 --> 05:44.080
<i>In the cold outer reaches…</i>

05:50.360 --> 05:52.720
…<i>the only surface water is ice.</i>

05:56.880 --> 05:59.320
<i>Like Saturn's frozen moons…</i>

06:01.640 --> 06:03.280
<i>where fountains of ice</i>

06:04.880 --> 06:07.400
<i>shoot kilometers into space.</i>

06:14.520 --> 06:17.800
<i>Closer to the Sun on Mars,</i>

06:18.720 --> 06:21.840
<i>water is stripped away</i>
<i>by savage solar winds.</i>

06:32.640 --> 06:34.240
<i>And on Venus,</i>

06:34.320 --> 06:36.040
<i>it simply boils away.</i>

06:45.560 --> 06:48.320
<i>There's only one world we know of</i>

06:48.400 --> 06:51.800
<i>that has the gift</i>
<i>of liquid water on its surface.</i>

06:57.120 --> 06:59.280
<i>A pale blue dot.</i>

07:00.920 --> 07:02.000
<i>Our home…</i>

07:08.160 --> 07:09.960
<i>where right now,</i>

07:10.800 --> 07:14.280
<i>water is driving one particular family</i>

07:14.800 --> 07:16.840
<i>on a quest for survival.</i>

07:24.600 --> 07:26.840
<i>Just a month after leaving the delta,</i>

07:27.920 --> 07:30.720
<i>only a scattering of muddy pools remain.</i>

07:34.840 --> 07:40.120
<i>And they're getting fewer</i>
<i>and farther apart each day.</i>

07:43.840 --> 07:48.480
<i>Pula is using her highly tuned memory</i>
<i>to lead her family to a water hole.</i>

07:55.040 --> 07:57.120
<i>She can remember the exact route,</i>

07:57.880 --> 07:59.480
<i>even decades later.</i>

08:03.680 --> 08:05.760
<i>It's been a long day's march,</i>

08:06.480 --> 08:09.640
<i>and all of them are desperate for a drink.</i>

08:13.800 --> 08:17.920
<i>But so are the other 130,000 elephants</i>

08:18.000 --> 08:19.600
<i>that live in Botswana.</i>

08:31.280 --> 08:34.800
<i>The dry season has drawn herds</i>
<i>from far and wide</i>…

08:39.840 --> 08:42.000
…<i>to this water hole.</i>

08:52.160 --> 08:56.360
<i>All competing</i>
<i>for the same shrinking resource.</i>

09:15.120 --> 09:19.240
<i>The adults teach the young ones</i>
<i>clever survival tricks,</i>

09:20.000 --> 09:23.920
<i>like how to skim a muddy pool</i>
<i>to get the freshest water.</i>

09:29.240 --> 09:34.000
<i>And how to use some muddy water</i>
<i>as refreshing sunscreen.</i>

09:36.880 --> 09:40.800
<i>Their wrinkly skin is perfect</i>
<i>for trapping water and keeping cool.</i>

09:49.480 --> 09:53.080
<i>But Metsi and Bosigo are also learning…</i>

09:56.120 --> 09:58.440
<i>mud pools aren't just a place to drink.</i>

10:00.080 --> 10:01.640
<i>They're water parks too.</i>

10:15.000 --> 10:16.960
<i>With so many thirsty elephants,</i>

10:17.480 --> 10:19.720
<i>the water hole has been drained.</i>

10:26.160 --> 10:28.000
<i>Pula's family must press on…</i>

10:31.840 --> 10:37.600
<i>and try to make it to the next water hole</i>
<i>before the blazing sun sucks it dry.</i>

10:40.720 --> 10:44.080
<i>This battle between sun and scorched earth</i>

10:44.160 --> 10:47.280
<i>has raged ever since our world was born…</i>

10:52.040 --> 10:56.000
<i>when our blue planet</i>
<i>was anything but blue.</i>

11:04.160 --> 11:06.840
<i>Four and a half billion years ago…</i>

11:12.600 --> 11:15.160
<i>Earth was in its infancy.</i>

11:16.640 --> 11:18.920
<i>A fireball of molten rock…</i>

11:23.440 --> 11:27.360
<i>…destined to become a dry, barren world.</i>

11:31.440 --> 11:34.560
<i>But millions of kilometers</i>
<i>out in the coldest reaches</i>

11:34.640 --> 11:35.880
<i>of the solar system…</i>

11:41.040 --> 11:42.720
<i>water crystals were forming</i>

11:43.680 --> 11:46.760
<i>on the surface of dust particles.</i>

11:54.480 --> 11:59.760
<i>Over time, these grains</i>
<i>of dust clumped together into asteroids.</i>

12:01.520 --> 12:03.920
<i>Millions and millions of them.</i>

12:06.080 --> 12:09.600
<i>And these became the asteroid belt.</i>

12:11.240 --> 12:14.440
<i>A vast expanse of icy rocks.</i>

12:17.640 --> 12:21.880
<i>Yet they've laid tantalizingly out</i>
<i>of Earth's reach.</i>

12:25.840 --> 12:27.680
<i>As luck would have it, however,</i>

12:28.400 --> 12:30.160
<i>a giant was on the move.</i>

12:39.080 --> 12:40.160
<i>Young Jupiter.</i>

12:41.160 --> 12:43.120
<i>A monster of a planet.</i>

12:48.080 --> 12:50.920
<i>Forces within</i>
<i>the turbulent inner solar system</i>

12:51.640 --> 12:55.520
<i>were slowly pulling it in toward the Sun.</i>

13:00.760 --> 13:03.880
<i>A flight path that brought it</i>
<i>into a collision course</i>

13:04.760 --> 13:06.440
<i>with the asteroid belt.</i>

13:22.080 --> 13:24.560
<i>As it thundered through the asteroids…</i>

13:28.480 --> 13:30.800
<i>…its massive gravitational force</i>

13:31.800 --> 13:34.000
<i>flung rocks in every direction.</i>

13:41.880 --> 13:46.160
<i>And yet,</i>
<i>from all this chaos and destruction</i>

13:46.240 --> 13:49.040
<i>came the ultimate cosmic gift.</i>

13:55.120 --> 14:00.760
<i>Icy, water-rich rocks</i>
<i>were hurled towards the Earth…</i>

14:06.360 --> 14:11.360
<i>…bringing the promise of life</i>
<i>one step closer.</i>

14:15.720 --> 14:17.280
<i>Over billions of years,</i>

14:17.360 --> 14:21.480
<i>asteroids were woven</i>
<i>into the fabric of Earth as it formed.</i>

14:25.680 --> 14:29.240
<i>Caught in the turmoil wrought by Jupiter…</i>

14:30.920 --> 14:34.120
<i>…driven deep into the Earth by asteroids,</i>

14:35.800 --> 14:39.800
<i>water molecules did not have</i>
<i>an easy journey getting here.</i>

14:42.760 --> 14:45.160
<i>And they still had a long way to go,</i>

14:46.320 --> 14:49.320
<i>imprisoned for millions of years,</i>

14:50.200 --> 14:52.640
<i>locked within Earth's molten core…</i>

14:55.640 --> 14:57.400
<i>waiting for another miracle…</i>

15:00.600 --> 15:01.960
<i>to set them free.</i>

15:12.040 --> 15:15.960
<i>Today, much of Earth's water</i>
<i>is still trapped underground.</i>

15:23.880 --> 15:28.120
<i>So elephants have evolved special skills</i>

15:28.200 --> 15:29.240
<i>to find it.</i>

15:39.400 --> 15:41.960
<i>Even the muddy pools are empty.</i>

15:43.240 --> 15:46.120
<i>This dry season</i>
<i>has become a full-on drought.</i>

15:49.560 --> 15:51.880
<i>But Pula has a superpower.</i>

15:54.200 --> 15:55.720
<i>Her incredible trunk,</i>

15:57.240 --> 15:59.880
<i>packed with millions of sense receptors…</i>

16:02.000 --> 16:04.440
<i>can smell water from kilometers away…</i>

16:09.040 --> 16:12.880
<i>and pinpoint its sources deep underground.</i>

16:23.720 --> 16:25.080
<i>But you have to dig for it.</i>

16:33.880 --> 16:35.640
<i>Metsi isn't a big digger.</i>

16:40.840 --> 16:43.080
<i>But Bosigo is a natural.</i>

16:51.520 --> 16:54.680
<i>And Metsi is offered a seat at the bar.</i>

17:00.360 --> 17:02.640
<i>These few sips won't last them long.</i>

17:07.280 --> 17:09.880
<i>But if water</i>
<i>had stayed trapped in the Earth,</i>

17:11.520 --> 17:13.240
<i>there would be none to drink.</i>

17:17.800 --> 17:19.680
<i>There would be no elephants.</i>

17:23.200 --> 17:25.280
<i>No life at all.</i>

17:37.800 --> 17:41.160
<i>After water</i>
<i>was delivered here by asteroids</i>

17:41.240 --> 17:43.480
<i>and consumed by the Earth…</i>

17:45.640 --> 17:48.280
<i>it was locked into the rock as crystals</i>

17:50.200 --> 17:51.800
<i>deep inside the planet.</i>

17:57.560 --> 18:00.160
<i>It stayed buried for millions of years,</i>

18:01.160 --> 18:04.360
<i>beneath a vast sea of magma.</i>

18:12.920 --> 18:17.880
<i>Until slowly but surely, Earth cooled.</i>

18:21.360 --> 18:25.880
<i>And its surface hardened to a thick crust.</i>

18:29.680 --> 18:34.240
<i>Then, finally,</i>
<i>the boiling interior broke through.</i>

18:43.720 --> 18:45.600
<i>Enormous volcanoes</i>

18:47.080 --> 18:50.880
<i>blasted gas and vapor</i>
<i>kilometers into the sky.</i>

18:58.720 --> 19:01.520
<i>At last, water molecules…</i>

19:03.000 --> 19:04.200
<i>…were set free…</i>

19:11.080 --> 19:13.800
<i>…and formed the first clouds.</i>

19:18.480 --> 19:21.080
<i>Growing and building</i>
<i>for millions of years,</i>

19:21.600 --> 19:23.400
<i>becoming laden with water…</i>

19:28.320 --> 19:31.120
<i>…until the temperature</i>
<i>dropped just enough…</i>

19:38.920 --> 19:41.480
<i>…for the very first raindrop…</i>

19:46.920 --> 19:50.560
…<i>to form and fall.</i>

20:08.800 --> 20:11.000
<i>What followed was a deluge…</i>

20:16.240 --> 20:18.640
<i>that lasted thousands of years.</i>

20:30.040 --> 20:32.080
<i>Puddles turned into rivers.</i>

20:41.520 --> 20:42.720
<i>Lakes…</i>

20:44.400 --> 20:45.760
<i>…became seas.</i>

20:53.480 --> 20:57.560
<i>And great oceans flooded Earth's surface.</i>

21:15.920 --> 21:20.120
<i>And here, water gave rise</i>
<i>to something magical.</i>

21:25.320 --> 21:26.840
<i>The first life.</i>

21:31.080 --> 21:33.680
<i>From these first cells</i>

21:35.000 --> 21:38.040
<i>sprang every living thing.</i>

21:40.640 --> 21:43.960
<i>Water is the fundamental ingredient</i>

21:44.040 --> 21:48.000
<i>of every cell of every creature on Earth.</i>

21:57.360 --> 21:58.440
<i>And today…</i>

22:01.320 --> 22:06.400
<i>the herd still carries</i>
<i>this ancient water within them.</i>

22:18.040 --> 22:20.240
<i>It transports nutrients and oxygen.</i>

22:30.200 --> 22:32.000
<i>It powers every heartbeat.</i>

22:38.920 --> 22:41.160
<i>And drives every breath.</i>

22:46.640 --> 22:49.240
<i>Life evolved because of water,</i>

22:51.000 --> 22:54.960
<i>which is why no life</i>
<i>can survive without it.</i>

23:01.920 --> 23:05.480
<i>In Botswana,</i>
<i>the drought is only getting worse.</i>

23:11.080 --> 23:13.880
<i>The elephants' world is on fire.</i>

23:22.600 --> 23:25.520
<i>The herd manages</i>
<i>to escape the burning forest</i>…

23:29.040 --> 23:31.320
<i>but walks straight into a new threat.</i>

23:37.560 --> 23:40.360
<i>In this drought, everyone is suffering</i>…

23:43.680 --> 23:46.160
…<i>from thirst and hunger.</i>

23:52.600 --> 23:56.960
<i>And for lions,</i>
<i>baby elephants would satisfy both.</i>

24:14.200 --> 24:17.320
<i>The adults rally around Metsi and Bosigo.</i>

24:24.720 --> 24:26.960
<i>It's enough to keep the threat at bay.</i>

24:30.680 --> 24:32.880
<i>But lions are patient creatures.</i>

24:36.880 --> 24:40.400
<i>And the herd still has to cross</i>
<i>an unforgiving wasteland…</i>

24:42.600 --> 24:44.280
<i>before the next water hole.</i>

24:48.520 --> 24:50.680
<i>They need a lifeline.</i>

24:53.760 --> 24:56.040
<i>And the Earth provides it</i>

24:57.720 --> 25:00.120
<i>in the most unexpected of places.</i>

25:05.320 --> 25:08.000
<i>The acacia tree is a beacon of hope.</i>

25:13.880 --> 25:16.800
<i>And a haven for creatures of all kinds.</i>

25:24.880 --> 25:28.320
<i>Its long roots reach</i>
<i>much deeper underground</i>

25:28.400 --> 25:30.400
<i>than an elephant could ever dig…</i>

25:41.240 --> 25:43.360
…<i>drawing water up to its branches…</i>

25:47.360 --> 25:48.520
<i>and leaves.</i>

26:01.000 --> 26:04.480
<i>It's just enough water to keep them going.</i>

26:08.280 --> 26:10.840
<i>Especially vital for Metsi's mother,</i>

26:12.720 --> 26:14.320
<i>still nursing her baby.</i>

26:18.320 --> 26:21.800
<i>But this is so much more</i>
<i>than just a local oasis.</i>

26:25.360 --> 26:28.480
<i>It's the vital link</i>
<i>in water's eternal cycle.</i>

26:32.720 --> 26:36.800
<i>The acacia tree connects ground and sky…</i>

26:43.600 --> 26:46.080
<i>…breathing oxygen and vapor into the air.</i>

26:55.000 --> 26:56.480
<i>Feeding clouds</i>

26:56.560 --> 26:59.320
<i>and powering water's journey</i>
<i>around the planet.</i>

27:07.400 --> 27:08.880
<i>Ever since rain</i>

27:10.120 --> 27:12.400
<i>fed the first green shoots</i>…

27:16.320 --> 27:18.840
<i>and gave life to the first tree…</i>

27:24.120 --> 27:27.720
<i>…plants have made our planet habitable…</i>

27:35.280 --> 27:37.680
<i>…bringing a once barren ball of rock</i>

27:39.440 --> 27:40.280
<i>to life.</i>

27:45.880 --> 27:48.760
<i>But the gifts our universe bestows</i>

27:50.320 --> 27:52.760
<i>can also be taken away.</i>

28:01.280 --> 28:02.760
<i>A long time ago,</i>

28:04.080 --> 28:05.680
<i>there was another planet</i>

28:06.680 --> 28:09.480
<i>whose surface was covered in liquid water.</i>

28:18.080 --> 28:20.600
<i>A water world just like ours.</i>

28:25.720 --> 28:28.440
<i>The same forces</i>
<i>that delivered water to Earth</i>

28:29.440 --> 28:32.000
<i>also gave it to Mars.</i>

28:35.200 --> 28:37.440
<i>With an atmosphere in place,</i>

28:37.520 --> 28:38.640
<i>clouds formed,</i>

28:40.480 --> 28:41.480
<i>rain fell,</i>

28:43.000 --> 28:44.440
<i>rivers flowed.</i>

28:48.800 --> 28:52.160
<i>And an ocean surged across its surface.</i>

28:57.240 --> 28:59.520
<i>It was a world of possibility.</i>

29:00.040 --> 29:02.320
<i>It had the potential for life.</i>

29:06.600 --> 29:08.080
<i>But it didn't last.</i>

29:13.720 --> 29:19.080
<i>Because not far away</i>
<i>was a raging nuclear inferno.</i>

29:21.040 --> 29:22.040
<i>Our Sun.</i>

29:24.120 --> 29:27.520
<i>It unleashes torrents</i>
<i>of high-energy particles</i>

29:27.600 --> 29:29.800
<i>so powerful and deadly…</i>

29:32.480 --> 29:34.480
<i>…they can devastate planets.</i>

29:43.960 --> 29:47.840
<i>This solar wind streams through space…</i>

29:52.320 --> 29:55.640
<i>at 400 kilometers per second.</i>

30:00.480 --> 30:03.160
<i>And it ripped through</i>
<i>the Martian atmosphere,</i>

30:04.640 --> 30:06.800
<i>tearing water molecules apart.</i>

30:15.040 --> 30:16.520
<i>Bit by bit,</i>

30:16.600 --> 30:18.160
<i>over millions of years,</i>

30:19.600 --> 30:24.480
<i>the planet's protective layer</i>
<i>was stripped away by the Sun's fury…</i>

30:29.680 --> 30:31.640
<i>…until its ocean evaporated…</i>

30:37.640 --> 30:41.040
<i>and its water was lost to space.</i>

30:48.600 --> 30:52.400
<i>Mars became a desolate, frozen shadow</i>

30:52.920 --> 30:54.280
<i>of its former self.</i>

31:03.360 --> 31:05.920
<i>Consumed by dust storms.</i>

31:12.520 --> 31:14.480
<i>Any chance of complex life…</i>

31:16.480 --> 31:18.280
<i>gone forever.</i>

31:27.560 --> 31:29.640
<i>This could have been our story too.</i>

31:44.360 --> 31:46.640
<i>But somehow, on Earth,</i>

31:47.560 --> 31:51.280
<i>water and life</i>
<i>have found a way to cling on.</i>

32:06.320 --> 32:07.960
<i>In Botswana,</i>

32:08.040 --> 32:10.640
<i>after 200 days in the burning sun…</i>

32:12.840 --> 32:15.000
<i>…there is no water to be found.</i>

32:23.680 --> 32:26.040
<i>Violent winds whip the scorched earth</i>

32:26.120 --> 32:27.600
<i>into a dust bowl.</i>

32:45.320 --> 32:49.440
<i>And the elephants' struggle</i>
<i>hasn't gone unnoticed.</i>

33:02.920 --> 33:06.800
<i>In daylight,</i>
<i>adults can usually protect their young.</i>

33:18.240 --> 33:19.800
<i>But when night falls…</i>

33:25.480 --> 33:26.920
…<i>it's a different story.</i>

33:37.520 --> 33:40.400
<i>Lions are masters of chaos and confusion.</i>

33:53.440 --> 33:55.880
<i>They pick the most vulnerable target…</i>

34:00.800 --> 34:02.120
<i>…working as a pack…</i>

34:08.200 --> 34:10.280
<i>…until there's nowhere left to run.</i>

34:27.240 --> 34:29.600
<i>Without the entire herd as protection,</i>

34:30.960 --> 34:34.080
<i>the lions overwhelm their prey.</i>

34:36.880 --> 34:40.600
<i>The drought and endless search</i>
<i>for food and water</i>

34:41.440 --> 34:44.880
<i>have taken their ultimate toll on Bosigo.</i>

34:55.040 --> 34:58.240
<i>Elephants form deep emotional bonds.</i>

35:09.920 --> 35:13.080
<i>All the family mourn Bosigo's loss.</i>

35:30.480 --> 35:32.840
<i>The herd gathers to comfort Metsi,</i>

35:34.680 --> 35:36.960
<i>who feels it hardest of all.</i>

35:48.480 --> 35:50.720
<i>The never-ending fight to survive</i>

35:50.800 --> 35:52.480
<i>plays out every year,</i>

35:54.280 --> 35:55.720
<i>across the Okavango…</i>

35:58.000 --> 35:59.280
<i>across our planet…</i>

36:01.960 --> 36:03.040
<i>and beyond.</i>

36:07.080 --> 36:09.560
<i>But in this battle for survival,</i>

36:10.440 --> 36:12.000
<i>Earth got truly lucky…</i>

36:14.000 --> 36:17.440
<i>with a secret guardian that protects it.</i>

36:24.360 --> 36:25.480
<i>Deep within…</i>

36:28.520 --> 36:32.280
<i>…the planet's raging molten furnace burns</i>

36:32.920 --> 36:33.920
<i>and churns…</i>

36:37.840 --> 36:40.240
…<i>generating a powerful magnetic field</i>

36:41.920 --> 36:44.360
<i>that extends from the heart of the planet…</i>

36:46.160 --> 36:50.680
<i>…65,000 kilometers out towards the Sun.</i>

36:52.600 --> 36:55.880
<i>A vital force field defending Earth…</i>

36:58.320 --> 37:01.040
<i>…from the same savage solar winds</i>

37:02.080 --> 37:04.040
<i>that stripped water from Mars.</i>

37:10.480 --> 37:13.920
<i>Defeating them</i>
<i>before they hit our atmosphere.</i>

37:26.520 --> 37:28.760
<i>Safeguarding our essential water.</i>

37:30.520 --> 37:34.160
<i>Hugging every drop close to our planet.</i>

37:41.040 --> 37:43.960
<i>This is what makes our pale blue dot</i>

37:44.480 --> 37:46.160
<i>unlike anywhere else.</i>

37:49.520 --> 37:52.920
<i>A place where life can thrive.</i>

37:56.960 --> 37:59.080
<i>Bringing relief to the elephants.</i>

38:01.600 --> 38:04.880
<i>Ensuring rains return each year</i>
<i>without fail.</i>

38:09.680 --> 38:14.000
<i>In the distance,</i>
<i>storm clouds are building.</i>

38:29.200 --> 38:33.800
<i>Elephants can detect</i>
<i>the low-frequency rumble of thunder</i>

38:33.880 --> 38:36.480
<i>from 240 kilometers away.</i>

38:43.400 --> 38:47.880
<i>And it's telling them it's time</i>
<i>to return to the Okavango.</i>

38:56.600 --> 38:58.440
<i>From the highlands of Angola,</i>

39:00.200 --> 39:03.080
<i>water is weaving its way through Botswana…</i>

39:12.000 --> 39:14.280
<i>…to rejuvenate the delta…</i>

39:22.640 --> 39:24.720
<i>with the kiss of life.</i>

39:34.480 --> 39:37.480
<i>Every step</i>
<i>that brings the herd closer to home…</i>

39:40.760 --> 39:45.280
<i>is a continuation</i>
<i>of a much larger cosmic odyssey.</i>

39:51.640 --> 39:57.280
<i>From tiny molecules hitching a ride</i>
<i>on dust beyond Jupiter…</i>

40:03.000 --> 40:05.800
<i>to surviving the crushing heat</i>
<i>of early Earth.</i>

40:13.680 --> 40:16.160
<i>Imprisoned in the planet's core…</i>

40:18.200 --> 40:19.880
<i>…then set free…</i>

40:21.240 --> 40:23.080
<i>…to sow the seeds of life…</i>

40:27.360 --> 40:31.880
<i>…every drop of water</i>
<i>has an amazing tale to tell.</i>

40:34.640 --> 40:36.000
<i>Every molecule…</i>

40:36.080 --> 40:39.120
<i>-…a link in an unbroken chain…</i>

40:40.440 --> 40:43.400
<i>…cycling over tens of thousands of years…</i>

40:46.480 --> 40:47.800
<i>…through air…</i>

40:50.840 --> 40:51.800
<i>oceans…</i>

40:55.680 --> 40:56.560
<i>rocks…</i>

41:04.800 --> 41:05.960
…<i>and elephants.</i>

41:11.680 --> 41:16.040
<i>After eight months</i>
<i>and hundreds of kilometers,</i>

41:17.720 --> 41:21.520
<i>Metsi and her family have finally reached</i>

41:21.600 --> 41:24.960
<i>the life-giving waters of the delta.</i>

41:38.040 --> 41:41.640
<i>It's well past time to drink…</i>

41:43.880 --> 41:45.080
<i>and play.</i>

41:47.440 --> 41:50.160
<i>And then, drink some more.</i>

41:59.560 --> 42:02.040
<i>And show the newest member of the family…</i>

42:06.360 --> 42:09.200
…<i>how they do things in the delta.</i>

42:22.360 --> 42:25.360
<i>Metsi and her new baby cousin</i>

42:25.440 --> 42:28.240
<i>are the latest in a long line</i>

42:28.320 --> 42:31.560
<i>to benefit from water's miraculous arrival</i>

42:32.800 --> 42:33.720
<i>on this planet.</i>

42:44.480 --> 42:46.440
<i>They will forever be connected</i>

42:46.520 --> 42:47.880
<i>to the universe</i>

42:48.800 --> 42:52.280
<i>that gave our planet this magic ingredient</i>

42:54.040 --> 42:59.920
<i>and gave us the ability</i>
<i>to preserve and treasure it.</i>

43:10.840 --> 43:15.120
<i>Next, the story of our universe concludes…</i>

43:16.280 --> 43:22.160
<i>…with the force that brings everything</i>
<i>we've seen so far together.</i>

43:23.560 --> 43:26.320
<i>The great sculptor of the cosmos,</i>

43:26.960 --> 43:27.800
<i>gravity.</i>

43:29.160 --> 43:32.520
<i>It's a force of attraction</i>
<i>that built our planet.</i>

43:35.560 --> 43:39.160
<i>And we'll bring two penguins together</i>
<i>at Earth's southern pole.</i>

43:41.040 --> 43:44.120
<i>But when did gravity</i>
<i>start exerting its influence?</i>

43:45.680 --> 43:50.080
<i>How does it create both order and chaos?</i>

43:52.920 --> 43:57.640
<i>And why does it make ours</i>
<i>the perfect planet for life…</i>

43:59.920 --> 44:00.920
<i>…and love?</i>
