00:00.260 --> 00:01.827
You don't need to avoid me.

00:02.114 --> 00:03.811
Why would I be avoiding you?

00:04.160 --> 00:05.719
You don't want to talk about her.

00:05.720 --> 00:06.799
That's not it.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.119
Argh!

00:08.119 --> 00:10.880
You've got a new friend, then?

00:10.880 --> 00:12.198
Thought we'd be new friends.

00:12.199 --> 00:13.440
You guys are on edge?

00:13.441 --> 00:14.720
Yeah.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.840
What the fuck is wrong with all
of you? What the fuck?!

00:52.720 --> 00:56.879
So, friends. This is it.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.639
This is your moment.

00:59.640 --> 01:04.718
When everything you've been striving
for, everything we tried to teach,

01:04.720 --> 01:07.679
everything that your parents
have dreamed of,

01:07.680 --> 01:12.959
that their lives
will finally add up to something.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.880
Now, it gets tested,

01:14.880 --> 01:18.840
in the crucible
of academic excellence.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.839
Mr Sweetcheeks
has your digital exam codes.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.559
You're all just numbers now.

01:25.560 --> 01:29.719
Ms Long has your personalised
exam timetables.

01:29.720 --> 01:34.399
Um, I've got stripes,
spots and diamonds.

01:34.400 --> 01:39.400
She's tracking you personally. So you
see, nothing can go wrong unless...

01:39.400 --> 01:40.320
Unless you balls it up.

01:40.321 --> 01:42.880
I think perhaps
that's not the right word, Simon.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.240
Unless you fuck it up.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.440
Well, I guess we're all adults now.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.720
Promise me.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.640
Promise me
you're going to take it easy.

Mini! Mini, come over!

02:16.880 --> 02:18.960
Where are you going?

02:24.640 --> 02:25.799
Hey, gorgeous!

02:25.800 --> 02:27.800
Who's this?

02:27.800 --> 02:29.760
Fuck knows!

02:41.480 --> 02:44.319
Oh, yes, get it out, girl!

02:44.320 --> 02:47.960
Oh, man! That is a lot of... Wow.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.200
Fuck off!

02:50.600 --> 02:52.600
You heard her.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.560
OK.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.360
Fancy a fuck?

02:58.360 --> 03:01.000
You read my mind. See you, mate!

04:09.160 --> 04:11.120
Fuck! Fuck!

04:12.680 --> 04:14.320
Jesus.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.919
Wake up, Olivia. I got a new bed,

05:17.920 --> 05:20.319
and it's, like, super bouncy.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.439
I'm going to show it to you. Ready?

05:22.440 --> 05:24.399
One, two, three!

05:24.400 --> 05:26.239
Like it?

05:26.240 --> 05:28.200
Slow and steady, slow and steady.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.760
Ready?

05:39.160 --> 05:42.280
Wake up, Olivia!
Wake up right now!

05:43.400 --> 05:44.880
Bouncy, bouncy!

05:48.320 --> 05:49.840
OK, one more time.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.240
One, two, three!

06:06.600 --> 06:07.639
Hi.

06:07.640 --> 06:08.679
Hi.

06:08.680 --> 06:09.839
Don't mind me.

06:09.840 --> 06:13.919
I don't. But you fucking fuck loud.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.479
No offence.

06:15.480 --> 06:16.799
None taken.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.119
I like fucking. You can't make
allowances for the world.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.439
Is that right?

06:21.440 --> 06:24.159
Sure. Got to let
the good times roll, you know?

06:24.160 --> 06:25.159
Where is he?

06:25.160 --> 06:26.280
Packing.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.398
Packing? For what?

06:27.399 --> 06:29.198
My mate's got a cottage at Minehead.

06:29.199 --> 06:31.680
We're going to go down and spend
some quality time together.

06:31.681 --> 06:34.320
Cottaging? Nice.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.839
He's right.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.279
You are edgy.

06:39.280 --> 06:41.599
Alex is never with one guy for long.

06:41.600 --> 06:45.039
So whatever you think might be
about to happen, it's not real.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.319
Is that why he keeps you?

06:47.320 --> 06:48.359
Keeps me?

06:48.360 --> 06:51.239
Yeah. To scare off the skanks.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.920
You're his little
bull terrier, right?

06:54.920 --> 06:55.920
Morning.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.480
I made you breakfast.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.680
Told you she's the best.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.360
Hmm. She's delicious.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.120
Mmmm! Motor's running.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.480
Fag hag.

08:36.480 --> 08:38.720
Aaagh!

08:45.360 --> 08:46.800
Urrgh!

08:56.200 --> 08:59.039
Well, don't you know...

08:59.040 --> 09:01.439
What the fuck
is that you're wearing?

09:01.440 --> 09:02.639
It's vintage.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.839
Looks like some fucked-up
hippy bullshit.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.799
What do you want?

09:06.800 --> 09:09.559
I want to go out. Have fun.
Do normal criminal shit.

09:09.560 --> 09:10.600
So go out.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.638
What are you doing?

09:11.639 --> 09:12.840
You never come home.

09:12.841 --> 09:15.960
Mom's totally worried you're, like,
fucking yourself up.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.240
Yeah? Where is she?

09:17.241 --> 09:19.679
She went on a hot
yoga-a-thon weekend.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.359
Right. So beside herself with worry,
obviously.

09:22.360 --> 09:26.359
Whatever. I just got out on licence,
I don't plan on being banged up

09:26.360 --> 09:29.439
in a flat with a smelly kid when my
tits still stick out straight.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.239
I'm busy.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.880
Yeah, well, I've got fucking
to catch up on too.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.720
Try not to stab anyone.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.919
Is your boyfriend here?

09:38.920 --> 09:40.320
He's not my boyfriend.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.560
Well, what is he?

09:41.561 --> 09:43.080
Shut up and get inside.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.240
This place looks like dead shit.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.360
Hey! Who taught you to speak
like that?

10:05.360 --> 10:06.519
Maudey?

10:06.520 --> 10:07.519
Yeah?

10:07.520 --> 10:11.079
I think... I think you do kind of
smell a bit, babe.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.119
Yeah. I stopped washing.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.799
Why?

10:14.800 --> 10:17.839
I wanted to see how long it would
take anyone to notice.

10:17.840 --> 10:18.999
And?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.680
Three weeks, two days, six hours.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.200
Silly bitches.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.240
Stop it! Get off! Get off! Stop it!

10:30.640 --> 10:32.679
Can I steal a dress too?

10:32.680 --> 10:33.759
No. What?!

10:33.760 --> 10:36.840
You took some old lady's dress.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.118
When's she coming back?

10:38.119 --> 10:39.400
She's not coming back.

10:39.401 --> 10:40.639
Why?

10:40.640 --> 10:41.840
She died.

10:41.840 --> 10:42.720
Like Gracey?

10:47.320 --> 10:48.640
Yeah.

10:49.800 --> 10:50.880
Like Gracey.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.600
Aaah!

10:57.600 --> 10:58.920
Aargh!

11:02.600 --> 11:05.439
What the fuck?

11:05.440 --> 11:08.800
Will you do my hair?
Come in and do my hair.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.320
OK. Budge up, then.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.720
Thank fuck.
I need to talk to you.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.560
Alex isn't here. This is Donovan.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.639
Oh.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.559
Can I, can I speak to him?

12:44.560 --> 12:47.079
I don't know where he is.

12:47.080 --> 12:49.039
We went to a club.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.680
He went off with some guys,
and I thought... Well, I...

12:52.680 --> 12:54.920
I thought he wanted to be with me.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.560
I guess he'll come back
for his phone, yeah?

13:02.440 --> 13:04.080
Liv...

13:18.680 --> 13:20.400
Can't speak to her, Gracey.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.320
Can you believe that?

13:29.120 --> 13:31.080
She doesn't even look at me any more.

13:35.800 --> 13:36.880
Nobody looks at me...

13:36.881 --> 13:38.440
Who are you talking to?

13:40.200 --> 13:41.279
Nobody.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.359
Yes, you were. You said Gracey.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.560
You shouldn't be listening
to people.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.920
I'm 13, I'm nosy.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.080
Move over.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.799
If I died, would you cry?

14:04.800 --> 14:07.639
Shh.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.879
What?

14:09.880 --> 14:13.159
You never cry. I used to think
it was because you were super brave,

14:13.160 --> 14:16.920
but now I just think
you're emotionally stunted.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.360
That's probably it.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.960
But I'd want you to cry
if I was dead.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.600
I'll do my best.

14:24.601 --> 14:25.840
Cool.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.399
You have to take me to school
tomorrow. I'm on report.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.519
What for?

14:32.520 --> 14:35.479
I stole the tampons
from the nurse station.

14:35.480 --> 14:36.720
The tampons?

14:36.720 --> 14:39.840
All the tampons. Now nobody can have
a fucking period. Fuck 'em.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.280
Don't die, ever.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.720
OK.

15:40.360 --> 15:43.399
Franks! Mate! Compadre.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.559
Hi.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.799
Tell whoever it is to fuck off!

15:46.800 --> 15:48.279
Whoa.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.879
Is she OK?

15:49.880 --> 15:51.519
Er, yeah.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.799
Just a bit stressy
about the English exam.

15:54.800 --> 15:59.399
English! We need to get into that,
Little Dorrit and all of it.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.200
Or we could just get totally
fucking wasted!

16:02.200 --> 16:03.920
Who is it?

16:05.480 --> 16:07.079
All right, Minerva?

16:07.080 --> 16:08.599
Hey.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.159
Remember me?
I'm your best matey, Liv.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.399
Have you been drinking?

16:13.400 --> 16:14.799
It's breakfast.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.119
Malone-style.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.359
It's 10 am.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.759
Yeah, so?

16:18.760 --> 16:21.360
Let's get wasted on Brandon Hill,
smoke a fatty.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.680
What about little bummer boy?

16:22.681 --> 16:24.840
He's away.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.920
Oh, so now you're back in my life?
Is that how it works?

16:31.120 --> 16:32.400
That's not fair.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.439
What's up with her face?

16:37.440 --> 16:40.160
Maybe just give it some time, yeah?

16:40.160 --> 16:41.720
Give what some time?

16:42.920 --> 16:44.440
What's going on?

16:44.440 --> 16:46.240
She'll talk to you when she's ready.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.720
Bye.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.800
How's the rugby player?

16:55.280 --> 16:57.119
Nick doesn't play rugby any more.

16:57.120 --> 17:01.599
What does he do? Go to Zach Braff
movies with you? Like Matty?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.520
Mostly we fuck.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.240
Says he's never really enjoyed it
before.

17:29.400 --> 17:32.720
Owww! Fuck!

17:34.000 --> 17:35.399
Ahh!

17:35.400 --> 17:39.399
Olivia? Are you all right?

17:39.400 --> 17:41.639
Yes. No.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.919
Something... My side hurts.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.919
Oh, dear.

17:45.920 --> 17:48.199
Go to the nurse, she'll have a feel.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.879
She always does for me.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.200
No, I don't want that.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.320
Oh.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.160
I mean, it's probably just my period.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.839
Oh, yes, the...

17:59.840 --> 18:01.359
Whoa! Ha...

18:01.360 --> 18:04.920
Yes, the... Right! The menstrual,
er...

18:04.920 --> 18:08.720
The divine mysteries
of the female anatomy.

18:10.280 --> 18:14.480
Liv, do I sound like a complete
twatting idiot sometimes?

18:16.040 --> 18:17.759
Er...

18:17.760 --> 18:20.639
No. We all respect you, Doug.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.200
You can't even remember
my last name.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.440
No, but that's a good thing,
isn't it?

18:29.000 --> 18:30.959
I'm leaving.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.519
Leaving my job here as principal.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.559
Really?

18:34.560 --> 18:37.959
Er... why?

18:37.960 --> 18:39.839
I want to learn how to snowboard.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.320
Some things...

18:41.320 --> 18:44.280
Horse riding. I saved up
for that myself.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.599
It's now or never.

18:47.600 --> 18:48.960
Kayaking.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.360
Taxidermy.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.559
I was thinking about Grace
this morning.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.999
She came into my head.

19:15.000 --> 19:15.840
Oh.

19:15.840 --> 19:16.840
It was funny.

19:18.160 --> 19:22.639
It was like she was helping me
remember this thought.

19:22.640 --> 19:27.559
Once, I danced to help a girl
get through an exam.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.799
You danced?

19:28.800 --> 19:30.960
Disco stylee.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.280
It was what she needed.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.200
What do you need, Liv?

19:43.880 --> 19:47.199
I want to tell someone
that I have a lump on my front.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.760
It's getting bigger and it hurts.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.000
I'm terrified.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.240
The nurse will look at it, and...

19:58.480 --> 19:59.920
and it will be nothing.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.120
Can you guarantee that?

20:06.640 --> 20:08.640
I wish...

20:08.640 --> 20:11.200
I wish adults could make more
promises.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.440
It's OK.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.000
I hope you like horse riding.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.480
I hope you like everything.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.320
Excuse me.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.199
Can I help you?

21:01.200 --> 21:02.719
Oh. Um...

21:02.720 --> 21:05.280
Just you've been standing
out here for 15 minutes.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.760
I wonder if you want to come inside.

21:06.761 --> 21:07.839
Oh, no.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.399
You don't have to wait.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.559
I can get you in to see a doctor.

21:11.560 --> 21:15.199
No, I'm just waiting to see,
for someone, I'm just waiting.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.760
You can wait inside.

21:16.760 --> 21:18.520
Um...

21:21.760 --> 21:24.920
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

21:35.920 --> 21:37.799
Mr Hinckles is mine.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.360
What's he doing with you?

21:39.360 --> 21:40.880
We've been having an affair.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.120
Look, I'm sorry about before.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.919
I was feeling sick.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.999
You've been hanging out with Franky
a lot.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.879
Yeah, but she's...
You know, she's with Nick now.

21:53.880 --> 21:58.719
So, you know, they're doing a
shitload of fucking and everything.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.119
It's romantic.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.119
Yeah.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.080
And you've got nothing to say about
that?

22:05.080 --> 22:06.360
How screwed that is?

22:06.361 --> 22:08.560
Whoring around all year?

22:08.560 --> 22:10.000
I'm right here, you know.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.800
Clearing out my locker
before I go whoring.

22:16.840 --> 22:20.360
Am I the only one who dares speak
to you about your bullshit?

22:20.360 --> 22:21.680
Bullshit?

22:23.080 --> 22:25.080
Yours.

22:26.760 --> 22:27.960
And yours.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.599
You know,
it's not my fault you're jealous.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.160
Because Matty and Nick chose me.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.720
Shit, no...

22:37.120 --> 22:39.880
Like I said, nobody calls you out.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.120
Nobody can say it.

22:41.121 --> 22:43.079
What?

22:43.080 --> 22:44.879
About what?

22:44.880 --> 22:47.279
That Grace wouldn't be dead

22:47.280 --> 22:49.479
if you hadn't been fucking over Matty

22:49.480 --> 22:51.920
and every other boy you get your
hands on.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.480
Franky!

22:56.360 --> 22:57.840
Better out than in.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.960
Just tell this stupid bitch
what you're supposed to tell her.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.840
Just tell her. OK?

23:19.720 --> 23:22.359
I've been having sex with Alo and...

23:22.360 --> 23:23.519
What?!

23:23.520 --> 23:26.680
Yeah. Er... with Alo, and...

23:26.680 --> 23:29.360
No! No, no, no, no, no.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.080
How long?

23:35.440 --> 23:37.159
A few months.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.080
But we stopped and...

23:39.080 --> 23:40.280
No, stop there.

23:40.281 --> 23:43.120
Is this what it's all about?

23:43.120 --> 23:45.840
You've been fucking Alo
and you didn't tell me?

23:49.520 --> 23:51.720
No, that's not it.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.480
Shut up.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.120
It doesn't matter.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.720
Liv, I...

24:30.200 --> 24:31.160
Rich!

24:35.360 --> 24:36.600
Hey.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.080
What are you doing?

24:46.720 --> 24:49.280
English Revolution.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.480
History, English Revolution
and shit.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.720
Interesting?

25:11.720 --> 25:14.840
Gracey told me that she made you
cum so hard once,

25:14.840 --> 25:17.160
you got spunk on a light bulb.

25:22.760 --> 25:24.680
Yeah.

25:24.680 --> 25:26.680
Right, cool.

25:30.720 --> 25:32.560
Something's wrong.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.320
Fuck it.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.159
Hey! Liv!

26:06.160 --> 26:08.039
What the fuck?!

26:08.040 --> 26:09.679
Shut up! Shut up!

26:09.680 --> 26:11.359
Cut it out!

26:11.360 --> 26:13.439
What are you doing?

26:13.440 --> 26:15.559
Liv, I'm trying to pass my exams.

26:15.560 --> 26:18.080
That's not right.
How come you just get to sit here?

26:18.080 --> 26:19.640
How come you're OK?

26:24.120 --> 26:25.999
I can explain...

26:26.000 --> 26:29.079
I don't want it!
Why is it me that has to care?

26:29.080 --> 26:31.559
You were her boyfriend.
She loved you.

26:31.560 --> 26:34.279
What the fuck are you doing in here?

26:34.280 --> 26:35.839
Fuck! Fuck!

26:35.840 --> 26:37.159
Fuck!

26:37.160 --> 26:38.680
Liv.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.600
Aargh!

26:43.400 --> 26:45.680
Liv, are you OK?

26:45.680 --> 26:49.000
Why aren't you in the fucking loony
bin?

26:51.120 --> 26:53.680
She can't do history revision,
can she?

26:53.680 --> 26:54.840
She is history.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.960
Liv! Wait!

27:22.480 --> 27:24.120
Shit. Shit.

27:35.040 --> 27:38.159
I'm sorry, we're closed.
If you'd only come ten minutes ago.

27:38.160 --> 27:41.480
I've been here for half an hour.
I was waiting.

27:41.480 --> 27:42.920
Why?

27:44.200 --> 27:45.920
So I didn't have to come in.

27:48.280 --> 27:51.080
Well, whatever it is, you have to
face it.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.839
I don't want to.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.120
Nobody does.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.080
Can you come back tomorrow?

28:01.080 --> 28:02.520
It doesn't matter.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.480
Truce?

29:07.640 --> 29:09.760
You should have told me about Alo.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.120
I'm sorry.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.480
No more secrets.

29:14.480 --> 29:17.000
I can't take it. OK?

29:21.040 --> 29:23.279
Hey, you know what?

29:23.280 --> 29:25.039
What?

29:25.040 --> 29:28.119
Little Dorrit. I've never read it.

29:28.120 --> 29:29.440
No?

29:29.440 --> 29:31.920
And I was hoping you could tell me
what happens in it,

29:31.921 --> 29:34.599
cos we're doing
our English A-levels tomorrow.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.960
Sorry. Why not ask Franky?

29:37.960 --> 29:39.760
Cos she wouldn't think it was funny.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.600
I love you!

30:38.680 --> 30:39.920
Cheers, ta.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.360
Maude?

30:53.361 --> 30:55.199
Where are you?

30:55.200 --> 30:57.399
Just at Brandon Hill.
Did you get in OK?

30:57.400 --> 30:59.039
Yeah, your friend helped me.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.199
He came back?

31:00.200 --> 31:01.959
Yeah, he's really nice.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.479
Yeah, he is nice.

31:04.480 --> 31:05.839
Did you eat some beans?

31:05.840 --> 31:06.919
Yeah.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.680
OK. I'll be home in a little while.

31:09.680 --> 31:11.000
Love you.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.680
Here.

31:21.200 --> 31:22.440
Thanks.

31:29.560 --> 31:30.920
Hey.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.120
Yeah?

31:35.840 --> 31:38.520
You wanna explain?

31:38.520 --> 31:40.240
Oh, you know I'd fuck it up.

31:42.480 --> 31:43.680
It's nice here.

31:44.720 --> 31:46.080
It's peaceful.

31:47.120 --> 31:48.560
Yeah.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.040
Yeah.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.480
She's lying, of course.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.240
Who?

32:00.240 --> 32:01.760
Use the bonce, lady.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.199
Where are you going?

32:09.200 --> 32:10.440
Can I come?

32:10.440 --> 32:13.400
Go home, black bitch.
Sort your shit out.

32:15.120 --> 32:17.480
Come on, the others are waiting
for us.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.400
Hey.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.720
Hi. Where's Alex?

32:45.560 --> 32:48.840
He was, like, super tired,
he went to bed.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.600
You too. Straight after that, yeah?

32:53.760 --> 32:56.639
Alex? Alex!

32:56.640 --> 32:58.320
Hey, poof!

32:58.320 --> 33:00.200
Am I glad to see you...

33:19.120 --> 33:21.680
Liv, I'm home!

33:45.640 --> 33:48.080
I'm going to shower for a long
time...

33:49.480 --> 33:51.480
Are you my sister's boyfriend?

33:52.960 --> 33:55.039
Um, no.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.919
Then why are you naked?

33:56.920 --> 34:00.279
OK. Now, I'll just say,

34:00.280 --> 34:04.079
the next time somebody tries
to give you this excuse,

34:04.080 --> 34:06.639
you absolutely must not believe
them.

34:06.640 --> 34:09.159
But I'm gay, and it doesn't matter
that I'm naked.

34:09.159 --> 34:10.839
It matters to me.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.079
And I'm sorry about that.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.199
In fact, I'm just gonna go.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.879
You're quite buff.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.360
Yep.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.920
Really going now. Cheers.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.880
Wakey-wakey.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.119
So, are you like
a welcome home present?

34:40.120 --> 34:41.760
Excuse me?

34:41.760 --> 34:42.760
From Liv.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.438
No.

34:46.440 --> 34:49.998
Well, don't mind me,
but this is my room.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.839
Yeah, totally, totally.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.279
Alex.

34:53.280 --> 34:55.079
Matty.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.279
The Matty?

34:56.280 --> 34:57.720
Who, um...

34:57.720 --> 34:59.640
Who ran away. Yeah.

35:02.400 --> 35:03.520
Shame.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.319
Yeah, well, I didn't mean to.

35:09.320 --> 35:11.839
Yes, you did.

35:11.840 --> 35:14.759
I've tried to explain to you.
I thought you understood.

35:14.760 --> 35:16.559
That doesn't mean I believe you.

35:16.560 --> 35:20.479
I said you could stay until the
morning - that's it, Matty.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.519
Then you should just fuck off.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.480
I'm sorry, Liv, I'm not leaving
Bristol until Franky understands.

35:26.480 --> 35:27.120
What?

35:27.121 --> 35:28.719
That I love her.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.640
Can I suggest that you go round
there now and tell her that?

35:31.640 --> 35:34.920
Then I can get some shut-eye.
Very nice to meet you, Matty.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.400
Happy to see me?

35:38.400 --> 35:40.600
Yeah. Hi.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.199
I missed you.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.719
I'm wasted in Minehead.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.280
I need to talk to you.

35:48.280 --> 35:51.400
Babe, any time.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.239
Please don't go.

37:12.240 --> 37:15.240
I don't really know
what my contribution in this is.

37:15.240 --> 37:17.680
Is there anything in particular you
want to say to me, Matty?

37:17.681 --> 37:19.239
I'm sorry.

37:19.240 --> 37:22.959
God, that's good, that's good.

37:22.960 --> 37:25.960
They smuggled you back into the
country so you could say that?

37:25.960 --> 37:29.280
I mean, fuck me, that's good!

37:35.280 --> 37:37.280
What do you want, Matty?

37:37.280 --> 37:38.800
If I could talk with you.

37:40.680 --> 37:42.000
I want...

37:44.680 --> 37:46.400
I want you to explain to me...

37:48.120 --> 37:50.240
what you're doing with my
brother.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.240
I'm fucking him.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.120
That's not right.

38:00.120 --> 38:02.640
No. It is right.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.080
It's really fucking right, OK?

38:08.840 --> 38:11.759
So you can just go back to Morocco.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.439
And live on that hill.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.840
I mean it, Matty, just fucking live
there.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.120
I'm staying.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.880
Well, I don't want to see you any
more.

38:39.840 --> 38:42.879
OK. Are we done?

38:42.880 --> 38:44.599
Shut up!

38:44.600 --> 38:47.519
Excuse me? I mean, why?

38:47.520 --> 38:52.039
He just came. I couldn't stop it.
I can't stop anything, OK?

38:52.040 --> 38:54.480
Fine. So go back to gay boy, then.

38:54.480 --> 38:55.200
Min...

38:55.201 --> 38:57.080
I really don't care.

38:57.080 --> 39:00.200
Matty, why are you still here?!

39:08.840 --> 39:10.759
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, go with him.

39:10.760 --> 39:14.040
I don't know what you want me to do.

39:14.040 --> 39:15.440
You're such a cold bitch.

39:15.441 --> 39:17.040
Yeah? Well, it feels right!

39:18.120 --> 39:20.160
You can't even say her name.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.719
Fuck you! Fuck you!

39:26.720 --> 39:29.079
Liv! Liv!

39:29.080 --> 39:32.159
You! You don't know anything!

39:32.160 --> 39:35.119
You fucking left me there,
you all fucking left me there!

39:35.120 --> 39:37.079
Don't hit me, please don't...

39:37.080 --> 39:39.559
I'm pregnant, I'm having a baby,
please!

39:39.560 --> 39:42.639
Please don't hit me!
Don't hit me!

39:42.640 --> 39:44.800
Please!

39:44.800 --> 39:46.680
I'm having a baby!

39:49.960 --> 39:51.760
What?

39:51.760 --> 39:53.360
I'm having a baby.

39:57.280 --> 39:59.680
No. You would have to...

39:59.680 --> 40:01.840
Liv, it's too late.

40:10.280 --> 40:10.920
Liv!

40:10.921 --> 40:12.560
Leave me alone!

40:12.560 --> 40:14.600
Liv!

40:49.120 --> 40:50.160
Oh!

40:51.520 --> 40:52.680
Hi.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.638
Hi. The doctors won't be here for a
while.

40:54.639 --> 40:55.920
Somebody needs to look.

40:55.921 --> 40:56.959
OK.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.560
No. Somebody needs to look now.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.000
Yes, OK.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.120
Hang on... one minute.

41:52.760 --> 41:54.880
Dr Gavin is on his way.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.240
He won't be too long.

41:58.120 --> 41:59.479
Will you look?

41:59.480 --> 42:01.359
I'm not a doctor.

42:01.360 --> 42:02.840
I know.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.400
OK.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.240
It's there.

42:09.240 --> 42:12.360
On the left,
I can't touch it any more.

42:13.480 --> 42:15.840
Does it hurt right now?

42:15.840 --> 42:17.360
It doesn't hurt.

42:19.280 --> 42:20.919
What's your name?

42:20.920 --> 42:22.800
Liv.

42:22.800 --> 42:25.760
Liv, I can't see anything here.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.280
There was a lump.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.240
Right there. It was hurting and...

42:33.320 --> 42:34.840
There's nothing there.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.920
It was there.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.160
It was right there.

42:52.040 --> 42:55.200
We'll get Dr Gavin to have a look.

42:55.200 --> 42:57.120
He's great. He really is.

42:58.920 --> 43:01.760
He'll understand, I promise.

43:08.800 --> 43:10.520
My friend died.

43:12.320 --> 43:13.520
Grace died.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.880
Oh, darling, I'm sorry.

43:18.880 --> 43:19.960
I'm sorry.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.999
I don't want to die.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.840
I don't want to die.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.440
I know.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.999
That's cool.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.760
Yeah.

44:50.760 --> 44:53.120
I think so too.

44:56.680 --> 44:59.080
Thanks, Doug.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.840
It's my pleasure.

45:02.120 --> 45:03.240
Can I watch it?

45:10.680 --> 45:13.199
'Wake up, Olivia.

45:13.200 --> 45:16.479
'I've got a new bed,
and it's, like, super bouncy.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.639
'I'm going to show it to you.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.999
'Ready? One, two, three!'

45:21.000 --> 45:23.040
Like it?

45:23.040 --> 45:25.360
Slow and steady, slow and steady.
