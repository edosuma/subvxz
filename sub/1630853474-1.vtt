WEBVTT

01:35.387 --> 01:37.764
Only thing you got in common with the King

01:37.848 --> 01:40.684
is a liking for peanut butter sandwiches.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.602
Yeah.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.146
That kind of combo clogs up the plumbing.

01:44.688 --> 01:45.772
Can't crap.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.401
Shit backs up to your eyeballs,
turns them brown.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.694
And then you drown.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.529
Now, there's a song for you.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.449
Eat your fucking vegetables.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.872
{\an8}<i>Holding a record
of14 wins and two losses,</i>

02:43.956 --> 02:45.541
{\an8}<i>hailing from Helena, Montana,</i>

02:45.624 --> 02:48.585
<i>he is currently the number-two-ranked
middleweight in ourgreat state.</i>

02:48.669 --> 02:51.338
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Stuart Long.</i>

03:01.014 --> 03:02.014
Got a future, brother.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.773
You have to do better than that.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.277
We love you, Stu.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.153
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.947
You like blonds now, huh?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.949
- She's sweet. She's sweet.
- Yeah.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.117
Enjoy it now, kid.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.661
You're almost past your prime. It happens.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.204
You're lucky I don't punch you.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.081
Take that, and give it to him.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.708
I'm gonna punch you in the mouth.

03:27.791 --> 03:28.791
All right, good.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.002
Come on, come on.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.049
Will you come on?

03:36.133 --> 03:37.467
Keep your hands up.

03:39.803 --> 03:40.846
Keep your guard up.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.472
I don't care he's the better boxer.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.433
You gotta be the better actor.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.516
I know.

03:48.145 --> 03:49.146
I love this, man.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.106
It's what I do.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.287
Hey.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.042
Well, that's just great.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.504
I won. I got some dough. What you want?

04:14.129 --> 04:15.214
A toaster.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.673
I'll get you a toaster.

04:23.347 --> 04:26.433
If you put half the effort
into a regular job

04:26.517 --> 04:28.560
that you put into beating ass,

04:28.644 --> 04:30.687
you'd be a manager one day.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.773
Why dress us as astronauts for Halloween

04:32.856 --> 04:34.691
if you didn't want us
to shoot for the moon?

04:34.775 --> 04:37.319
That's when I had two of you to bet on.

04:39.738 --> 04:40.948
Where is this clown?

04:41.031 --> 04:43.200
Hey, tell her it's nothing.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.284
Not quite.

04:44.368 --> 04:47.454
You have a serious infection
of the bone in your jaw,

04:47.538 --> 04:50.707
as well as extremely high
inflammation markers in your blood.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.377
Same thing as last time.
Your colleague gave me antibiotics.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.378
Did the trick, right?

04:54.461 --> 04:57.381
After your last three fights,
you've developed fevers and infections.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.258
That's not a normal response to injury.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.592
What does that mean?

05:00.676 --> 05:02.845
Medically speaking,
we'd need further testing

05:02.928 --> 05:05.013
to determine the source of the problem,

05:05.097 --> 05:08.308
but metaphorically, seems like
your body is telling you not to fight.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.686
Meta... Fuck that. What?

05:12.479 --> 05:15.399
The decision is yours,
but I must make you aware

05:15.482 --> 05:18.318
that the complications
could be life-threatening.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.658
You set this up, didn't you?

05:25.242 --> 05:27.077
She tell you to say that?

05:28.453 --> 05:31.081
- Could you give us a minute?
- We got the Keystone Kops here.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.875
Don't listen to this loser.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.794
Shit, he trying
to run up the bill on you, Mama.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.630
Damn you
for being so careless with your life.

05:38.714 --> 05:41.341
Careless?
I'm fighting for it. And yours too.

05:41.425 --> 05:44.261
I put food on the table.
Your deadbeat husband don't.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.555
Grief ain't a disability. I looked it up.

05:46.638 --> 05:49.433
What you think, you'll get to be a pro?

05:49.516 --> 05:53.395
Honey, you're the age
most guys are when they pack it in.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.689
You're still scrapping for a sponsor.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.274
Look me in the eyes and tell me

05:57.357 --> 06:00.652
that some plastic trophy
is worth more than your life.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.446
You only got yourself to blame.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.741
Making a fuss over
all them damn participation ribbons.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.327
You set a low bar.
What you expect from your son?

06:08.410 --> 06:10.537
That this one don't fucking die.

06:15.667 --> 06:16.793
I ain't that lucky.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.724
I heard them oil rigs went up pay good.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.102
I ain't doing no blue-collar bullshit.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.357
Well, honey, what else is there?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.800
<i>Dad caught me playing in your room.</i>

07:06.093 --> 07:07.886
Got a heck of a hiding for it.

07:18.981 --> 07:21.900
Sometimes I thought
I hated you for being so good.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.236
Making me look bad.

07:26.154 --> 07:29.825
<i>Dad probably wonders why
he gotta keep a piece of shit like me.</i>

07:40.043 --> 07:41.043
You want it?

07:44.965 --> 07:45.965
Come get it.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.120
What, you think I missed?

08:29.092 --> 08:30.511
I never miss.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.525
Oh, shit.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.114
Evening, officers.

08:52.157 --> 08:53.700
Everything all right here?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.911
Just paying my respects.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.581
You Bill's son?

08:59.665 --> 09:03.418
Wow, all these years gone,
he's still making me look bad, huh?

09:09.007 --> 09:10.884
Chip off the old block, huh?

09:29.736 --> 09:30.988
Good to see you, Stu.

09:32.531 --> 09:34.283
Until we meet again, prick.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.036
Hey, Mama.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.125
Resisting arrest?

09:43.208 --> 09:46.128
I challenged the officer's judgment.
It was a stimulating exchange.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.754
I made him a better cop.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.299
- Get in the car.
- If they told you why, you'd pat my back.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.010
Ain't that the story of your life?
Being out of context.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.845
I got some good news for you.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.020
- I figured it out.
- Yeah?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.688
Seventh time's a charm?

10:04.771 --> 10:07.149
No, I figured out what I'm gonna do.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.651
- I'm gonna be an actor.
- Oh, God.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.904
Think about it.
Nothing ever made more sense.

10:11.987 --> 10:13.780
I mean, I was born to perform.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.824
It just took some time to find my stage.

10:15.908 --> 10:17.784
Yeah? Where's that at?

10:17.868 --> 10:18.868
Hollywood.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.872
You ain't been west of Missoula.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.874
You got a map, I'm gonna make it there.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.669
You don't belong with L.A. folks.

10:27.753 --> 10:31.715
They're a bunch of carpetbaggers.
Communist fucking fascist hippies.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.801
I ain't trying to belong.
I'm trying to stand out.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.678
Wait till you see me saving the world,

10:36.762 --> 10:38.764
shooting bad guys,
kissing them girls in pearls.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.516
Probably all three at once.

10:41.725 --> 10:45.604
Isn't it a little late
to, you know, try that?

10:45.687 --> 10:48.398
They gonna say "late,"
they gonna say "great."

10:48.482 --> 10:49.983
And I ain't even gonna be dead yet.

10:53.904 --> 10:54.947
Well?

10:55.030 --> 10:56.573
You gonna look your father up?

10:56.657 --> 10:58.784
- Am I gonna look my father up?
- Yeah.

10:58.867 --> 10:59.867
Fuck Bill.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.038
Come on, let's go.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.629
Yeah, fuck Bill.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.102
You throwback mother...

11:29.898 --> 11:33.652
I'm trying to do
a public service, asshole.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.238
Learn how to drive, idiot.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.994
<i>Hello. Can I get the vehicle number?</i>

11:42.077 --> 11:46.957
Yeah, vehicle number,
jerk-off-kilo-limp-dick-ten.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.916
<i>How's his driving?</i>

11:48.000 --> 11:49.751
I'll tell you how's his fucking driving.

11:49.835 --> 11:52.880
His parents must be cousins.
He's driving like a fucking half-wit.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.715
Be ahead hiring a crash test dummy...

11:54.798 --> 11:56.884
<i>If you are satisfied
with your message, press one.</i>

11:56.967 --> 11:58.093
Son of a bitch.

12:05.225 --> 12:09.188
Somebody gotta find a better way
to rat these retards out, you know?

12:10.606 --> 12:14.401
Make a decent driver crash
just for trying to do the right thing.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.350
<i>Let's just start with a week.</i>

12:46.433 --> 12:50.187
That's $182. If you book a month out,
you save 20 percent.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.730
I don't need a month to make it.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.524
You and everybody else in this town.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.858
You got some advice?

12:54.942 --> 12:56.944
I'm still trying to be discovered.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.488
I hit it big, I'll take you with me.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.948
All the way to the top.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.575
Payment's due Monday.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.663
- Don't sell yourself short.
- Oh, I won't.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.374
I'll see you Monday.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.753
Oh, shit.

13:16.046 --> 13:17.046
Oh, yeah.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.634
Hello? Yeah, this is Mr. Long.
Hold all my calls.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.717
Really?

13:22.636 --> 13:24.429
I'll have to think about that.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.723
Hollywood, baby. Hollywood.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.725
Hot damn, you in Hollywood, kid.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.854
What did he say?

13:31.937 --> 13:32.938
I made it.

13:33.605 --> 13:34.606
Oh, shit.

13:35.274 --> 13:37.484
See what channel
I'm gonna be on every night.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.111
Every night.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.279
Oh, yeah.

13:40.362 --> 13:41.362
The fuck?

13:43.365 --> 13:48.120
Ain't no antenna on here.
$182 for this shit. It better be working.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.080
Yeah, I got a problem.
The TV ain't working.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.208
Tomorrow? I paid $182.
I need a goddamn TV.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.587
Shit. You gotta be kidding me.

13:57.629 --> 14:00.465
Better get her big ass up here
and fix this shit.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.389
I made it.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.870
"Gas station attendant.
Christmas tree lot."

14:29.953 --> 14:32.581
I was voted Santa's favorite elf.

14:32.664 --> 14:33.832
Nice.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.668
"Amateur boxer. Record 15 and two.

14:36.752 --> 14:40.631
1985 Gold Gloves Middleweight
titleholder for the state."

14:40.714 --> 14:42.341
I won that one by knockout.

14:42.883 --> 14:43.967
So...

14:45.177 --> 14:46.428
what brings you here?

14:47.095 --> 14:51.600
Hung up the gloves. I thought I'd cash in
on my face, instead of my fists.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.435
Get more mileage out of that.

14:53.519 --> 14:56.355
No better place
to be discovered than the supermarket.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.482
Even Hollywood big shots gotta buy beans.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.608
Yeah.

15:00.192 --> 15:01.360
You wanna be an actor.

15:01.443 --> 15:04.571
It's not like anyone aspires
to work at a supermarket.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.198
Unless they do, and that's cool.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.408
They're probably happier in the long run.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.118
Yeah.

15:10.202 --> 15:13.413
What skills do you possess
that would make you suited for this job?

15:13.497 --> 15:15.958
I'm real charming. Ask my mama.

15:16.708 --> 15:17.708
I'll bet.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.838
- I might have something for you.
- Yeah.

15:32.266 --> 15:35.477
Here you go.
Hey, did I see you in a television series?

15:38.063 --> 15:41.400
- You got any family in the film industry?
- No, I don't.

15:43.235 --> 15:45.237
- You do movies?
- No.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.576
You don't work
in the entertainment industry?

15:50.659 --> 15:51.659
No, man.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.790
Sir. Let me wrap it up for you.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.459
Wanna get right to it, huh?

16:01.879 --> 16:04.464
- You got friends in the film industry?
- Nah.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.936
You're not exactly what we're looking for.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.146
I've heard that before.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.898
Trying to be a human billboard.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.066
Sign spinner. You know the gig.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.527
Gave the job to some other little punk.

16:25.611 --> 16:28.864
I set up on the other side of the city.
I got ten times the customers he did.

16:34.328 --> 16:35.412
All right, well...

16:37.289 --> 16:40.542
If you're willing to prove yourself,
I'm open to persuasion.

16:40.626 --> 16:42.169
Yeah. What do I got to do?

16:48.217 --> 16:49.635
How badly you want it?

16:57.643 --> 16:58.643
Okay.

17:03.357 --> 17:05.192
- How about I put your lights out?
- Okay...

17:05.275 --> 17:07.069
Then you tell me
if you see a fucking star.

17:07.152 --> 17:09.238
Okay, not necessary. Not necessary.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.366
Okay.

17:13.281 --> 17:14.535
- I'm taking my picture.
- Yeah.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.082
Send in the next person, please?

17:26.547 --> 17:27.547
Jesus...

17:28.507 --> 17:30.592
Claire, we need a new camera.

17:49.695 --> 17:51.446
Best kind of date, huh?

17:52.406 --> 17:55.617
Big bedroom eyes, keeps her mouth shut.

17:56.368 --> 17:58.745
I like a woman
who ain't afraid to say who she is.

18:00.664 --> 18:02.165
Who do you want me to be?

18:03.834 --> 18:06.086
I want a menu, I go to the restaurant.

18:10.382 --> 18:14.386
Sometimes I need help
getting out of character.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.763
Be right back.

18:20.475 --> 18:23.729
Hell, she'd fuck that elk
if it had a dick and a dollar.

18:31.862 --> 18:35.616
This town wants me to think that my job's
at the mercy of some scumbag,

18:35.699 --> 18:38.952
and my dick's at the mercy
of some slut's low standards?

18:45.292 --> 18:47.961
A real man earns a win
on his own damn merits.

18:49.630 --> 18:50.756
Shit.

18:50.839 --> 18:51.924
Shit.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.007
All right.

18:59.056 --> 19:01.808
- Tell me about the pork.
- That pork's on sale.

19:02.601 --> 19:03.685
Why's that now?

19:03.769 --> 19:05.103
Why you think?

19:05.187 --> 19:07.272
Pig was ugly, or the meat gone old.

19:07.356 --> 19:10.484
They don't tell me this shit, sir.
My job is to sell what's on the sign.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.988
I'll take two racks of lamb.

19:16.823 --> 19:17.823
Yeah.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.548
What can I get for you, miss?

19:33.882 --> 19:35.425
Nothing, thank you.

19:35.509 --> 19:36.593
I got beef.

19:37.553 --> 19:38.720
I can see that.

19:39.555 --> 19:41.014
I'll have fish tonight.

19:41.098 --> 19:43.892
- Don't let me change your mind.
- You didn't.

19:43.976 --> 19:47.896
You can find a fish in a can,
or you can let me take you to dinner.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.357
I don't like being told my choices.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.359
How about I take you fishing,
we compromise?

19:52.943 --> 19:53.943
No, thanks.

19:53.986 --> 19:55.153
I didn't catch your name.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.489
Not much of a fisherman then, are you?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.033
Hey.

20:02.077 --> 20:04.288
- Stuart, a word.
- I gotta go help a lady out.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.623
People don't run from help
if they want it.

20:06.707 --> 20:09.251
Stalking customers is a fireable offense.

20:09.334 --> 20:10.794
They used to call it romance.

20:10.878 --> 20:12.713
Meat sales are down 20 percent.

20:12.796 --> 20:14.798
You come in here with your face fucked up.

20:14.882 --> 20:17.301
Looks like you done battle
with the cow trying to kill it.

20:17.384 --> 20:20.637
- They might prefer that to the truth.
- Meat room. Till this shit clears up.

20:20.721 --> 20:22.639
Get a Fish Department in here.

20:22.723 --> 20:23.807
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:30.939 --> 20:32.858
- Shit.
- Life is short, Stu.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.777
Too short to be a dick or deal with one.
What you trying to say?

20:35.861 --> 20:38.113
I'm not trying, I'm saying.

20:38.197 --> 20:40.741
If you watched the love of your life
slip through your hands

20:40.824 --> 20:43.702
because there ain't a Fish Department,
you'd be in a dick mood too.

20:44.494 --> 20:48.582
If she's the dime piece
I suspect you're after,

20:48.665 --> 20:50.459
I saw her leave this here.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.377
I bet my bonus she'll be there.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.677
You don't get that bonus, you let me know.

21:00.761 --> 21:02.095
I'll take care of it.

21:02.179 --> 21:04.598
- Come here. Come here.
- Oh, no, no, no.

21:04.681 --> 21:05.766
Come here.

21:06.350 --> 21:07.350
Come here.

21:14.525 --> 21:16.485
Oh, yeah. Shit.

21:28.747 --> 21:31.375
Hey. Hey.

21:32.251 --> 21:33.251
Remember me?

21:34.628 --> 21:36.046
Oh, fuck off, Father.

21:49.101 --> 21:50.101
Brethren.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.064
Let us acknowledge our sins,

21:54.147 --> 21:58.610
and so prepare ourselves
to celebrate the sacred mysteries.

21:58.694 --> 22:02.489
I confess to Almighty God,
and to you, my brothers and sisters,

22:02.573 --> 22:04.825
that I have greatly sinned.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.743
In my thoughts and in my words.

22:06.827 --> 22:08.203
In what I have done.

22:08.287 --> 22:10.330
- In what I have failed to do.
- failed to do.

22:10.414 --> 22:11.957
I don't know about this one.

22:12.833 --> 22:17.713
Through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.423
That's a bit dramatic.

22:19.506 --> 22:21.175
- Therefore...
- Jesus.

22:22.593 --> 22:24.928
May Almighty God have mercy on us,

22:25.012 --> 22:26.180
forgive us our sins

22:26.263 --> 22:28.891
and bring us to everlasting life.

22:28.974 --> 22:30.601
Amen.

22:36.481 --> 22:38.275
Want help, you should've thought of that.

22:40.527 --> 22:41.527
Son.

22:41.987 --> 22:44.114
You can't fool God.

22:44.198 --> 22:46.283
Maybe no one's done it good enough.

22:47.576 --> 22:48.576
Let us pray.

22:50.871 --> 22:52.206
Cool to sit here?

22:52.289 --> 22:53.289
Yeah.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.086
Ham.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.381
Oh, that's beef. I'd know.

23:02.674 --> 23:05.385
No, my name. My name's Ham.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.094
Like a pig?

23:07.971 --> 23:09.640
Yeah, nigga, like a pig.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.892
That's your real name?

23:12.559 --> 23:13.559
Yeah.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.772
That's a biblical name. That's Noah's kid.

23:16.855 --> 23:19.066
You'd think
he'd have enough pork on board that ship.

23:20.067 --> 23:21.318
You must be new here.

23:23.111 --> 23:26.907
Why, I look out of place?
You look in the mirror lately?

23:26.990 --> 23:30.244
I thought your people
was the God-fearing folk, brother.

23:30.911 --> 23:33.956
Ain't a lot of them Catholic,
but there's just different denominations.

23:34.039 --> 23:37.042
A brother was one of the greats.
Augustine of Hippo.

23:37.626 --> 23:40.671
Well, let me guess. He was on board too.

23:43.298 --> 23:44.298
I...

23:46.844 --> 23:47.845
I need your help.

23:50.514 --> 23:53.392
I'm looking for the girl who left this.
Know her?

23:53.976 --> 23:54.976
Of course you are.

23:55.018 --> 23:57.479
- Why you say that?
- She real good at spreading the word.

23:57.563 --> 24:00.524
Puts all us priest prospects to shame.
Carmen's her name.

24:00.607 --> 24:03.485
She's about as Catholic
as the cross itself.

24:04.069 --> 24:06.113
We're taking sign-ups
for volunteer positions.

24:06.947 --> 24:08.365
No better way to assimilate.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.616
God ain't got time for me,

24:09.700 --> 24:11.994
I ain't got time for him,
especially between auditions.

24:12.578 --> 24:14.371
Put me down for hospital visits.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.373
Shame we can't all be as generous as Ham.

24:20.419 --> 24:21.420
Hey.

24:22.588 --> 24:24.464
Sudden change of heart, huh?

24:25.048 --> 24:26.049
Hell, yeah.

24:27.384 --> 24:28.760
We don't need security.

24:28.844 --> 24:31.930
We don't know what we need till
it hits us in the face or steals our shit.

24:32.014 --> 24:33.014
Hey.

24:33.056 --> 24:34.683
- Hi, Ham. Jacob.
- Hey.

24:34.766 --> 24:35.809
Stuart.

24:36.393 --> 24:37.436
Hi.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.605
You wanna do this with an audience?

24:40.856 --> 24:42.316
How'd you know my name?

24:42.399 --> 24:45.319
You wear a name tag at work.
How did you find me?

24:45.402 --> 24:47.279
I asked God to show me the way.

24:47.362 --> 24:50.991
He took me down Santa Monica,
left at the light into this lot.

24:51.074 --> 24:51.909
What do you know?

24:51.992 --> 24:53.493
What are you hoping to accomplish?

24:53.577 --> 24:57.539
Hope ain't a tactic. I come
to find the light. I'm looking at it.

24:57.623 --> 24:59.166
This tactic work for you?

24:59.249 --> 25:01.835
Stalking your prey
and smothering them with cheese?

25:01.919 --> 25:04.630
Most things taste good like that.
You like nachos?

25:04.713 --> 25:07.841
- Because I'm Mexican?
- Is that right? I wouldn't know.

25:07.925 --> 25:09.635
I can't see, you're so bright.

25:11.136 --> 25:12.930
You like that one, huh?

25:13.680 --> 25:16.141
- I have to teach.
- I got a lot to learn.

25:16.225 --> 25:18.060
At Sunday School. For kids.

25:18.644 --> 25:21.063
I'm an actor. I can be whatever you need.

25:22.523 --> 25:24.525
You don't take "no" for an answer.

25:24.608 --> 25:26.318
I don't need a "yes" to know I'm right.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.028
What do you think you're right about?

25:29.321 --> 25:32.616
You wanna let me take you fishing,
but you're scared.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.911
I made a living reading fear
in people's eyes. I was a boxer.

25:36.662 --> 25:40.082
- What am I scared of?
- Getting knocked off your feet.

25:40.165 --> 25:42.876
Might take 12 rounds to get them
on their back, but I'm patient.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.253
Get me on my back?

25:44.837 --> 25:47.714
I'm a Catholic. No sex before marriage.

25:48.632 --> 25:50.843
Ain't that what confession's for?

25:51.885 --> 25:54.638
I thought that'd be the case.
Let's not waste either of our times.

25:54.721 --> 25:57.099
I'd wait 40 years in the desert for you.

26:00.519 --> 26:02.729
You can start with an hour in church.

26:03.313 --> 26:04.523
I'll be there.

26:08.569 --> 26:09.569
I'll be there.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.491
Hey, Mama.

26:14.575 --> 26:15.784
I got my break.

26:15.868 --> 26:18.328
<i>Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.</i>

26:19.288 --> 26:20.747
Watch your soap and you'll see me.

26:20.831 --> 26:22.958
I can't wait to tell the girls.

26:24.877 --> 26:25.877
Love you.

26:26.545 --> 26:28.046
<i>I'll remember that.</i>

26:30.257 --> 26:31.592
<i>Oh, Jack.</i>

26:32.467 --> 26:35.804
<i>I will get you for this
if it's the last thing I ever do.</i>

26:39.308 --> 26:41.393
<i>Are you using paper towels?</i>

26:42.269 --> 26:43.604
<i>No, no, no.</i>

26:44.396 --> 26:47.858
<i>Yeah, I'm talking to you.
Stop throwing cash in the trash.</i>

26:47.941 --> 26:50.944
<i>And get yourself a Marvelous Mop.</i>

26:51.028 --> 26:54.364
<i>These things are so cool.
They're double-action.</i>

26:55.073 --> 26:56.241
<i>Quick retracting.</i>

26:58.785 --> 27:00.329
<i>Clean up the mess so fast,</i>

27:00.412 --> 27:02.247
<i>your missus will never know what happened.</i>

27:02.331 --> 27:05.000
<i>Get yourself a Marvelous Mop.</i>

27:50.254 --> 27:51.755
I miss you, little buddy.

27:53.131 --> 27:54.131
Happy birthday.

27:58.220 --> 27:59.596
Look at you now.

28:00.264 --> 28:01.515
Look at me now.

28:02.599 --> 28:04.268
Both amongst the stars, huh?

28:19.992 --> 28:21.243
<i>Pull over.</i>

28:21.326 --> 28:24.371
- Oh, shit.
<i>- Pull over to the side of the road.</i>

28:35.966 --> 28:38.177
Step out, hands where I can see them.

28:40.721 --> 28:44.349
That what it feels like to be God,
knowing you hold all cards,

28:44.433 --> 28:46.977
it don't matter if it's fair
how you decide to play them?

28:47.060 --> 28:50.606
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands where I can see them.

28:51.857 --> 28:55.360
What the fuck happens to a kid,
make him wanna be a cop?

28:56.862 --> 28:57.779
Hey, hands.

28:57.863 --> 28:58.989
Hands!

28:59.072 --> 29:00.949
I'm trying to...

29:01.033 --> 29:02.034
Wallet, my ass.

29:02.117 --> 29:03.243
Get out of the car.

29:13.670 --> 29:14.505
Hi.

29:14.588 --> 29:15.588
Good morning.

29:23.347 --> 29:24.347
Oh, fuck.

29:26.433 --> 29:27.433
You're late.

29:28.936 --> 29:33.148
And you overstayed your welcome.
I bet even God don't like a kiss-ass.

30:03.220 --> 30:04.220
Excuse me, sir.

30:05.138 --> 30:05.973
Yeah?

30:06.056 --> 30:08.517
Does Bill know
you're fussing with his truck?

30:08.600 --> 30:10.602
I'm his son. Just borrowing it.

30:14.940 --> 30:17.317
<i>Bill, do you copy?</i>

30:20.279 --> 30:22.823
- This is Bill.
- <i>There's a guy in your truck with a knife.</i>

30:23.615 --> 30:25.742
<i>Think I need a knife to fuck you up?</i>

30:26.743 --> 30:30.873
Bill can't find his crack in his ass,
much less keep track of his shit.

30:30.956 --> 30:33.166
I'm doing him a service,
teaching him a lesson.

30:33.250 --> 30:37.087
I'm sorry, John.
My son has issues with boundaries.

30:37.171 --> 30:40.048
That's the new way to say "handicapped."
He means "retard."

30:40.132 --> 30:42.593
He's playing with a full deck,
just a bad one.

30:42.676 --> 30:43.594
Bill knows his cards.

30:43.677 --> 30:45.971
- He got the gambling bug.
- I'll take it from here.

30:46.054 --> 30:49.224
He's not out in five minutes,
I'm calling the cops on both of you.

30:49.766 --> 30:53.103
- Hi, how you been?
- Give me the keys. I got an audition.

30:53.187 --> 30:55.397
- I'm gonna be late.
- Audition?

30:55.480 --> 30:57.858
- For what?
- Movie. None of your business.

30:57.941 --> 31:00.152
You're trying to steal my truck
to get there.

31:00.235 --> 31:03.655
Once I get my check from the supermarket,
I'll spring my ride and give yours back.

31:03.739 --> 31:07.534
It's a few months' worth of cleanups
on Aisle 4 to pay off a DUI impound.

31:07.618 --> 31:08.535
That is the offense?

31:08.619 --> 31:10.495
If you sent half
of what you spend on whiskey

31:10.579 --> 31:12.289
to your wife, you might have a marriage.

31:13.874 --> 31:17.544
I appreciate your concern,
but this is not my moment, son.

31:17.628 --> 31:22.716
You know, I could've got you in here.
Good pay, benefits, a little dignity.

31:22.799 --> 31:25.010
They hire inbreds.
I could run this shit, I want to.

31:25.093 --> 31:27.346
Think you gonna be the next John Wayne?

31:27.429 --> 31:31.016
Damn right. You had a chance
to make something of yourself out west.

31:31.099 --> 31:33.185
All you got is a bigger gut,
beard, and bald spot.

31:33.268 --> 31:36.688
This is not the fucking gold rush.
Some of us just trying to survive.

31:36.772 --> 31:39.107
Yeah, every man, woman,
and child for themselves, right?

31:39.191 --> 31:41.735
Right. End of the day, that's all you got.

31:41.818 --> 31:44.154
Everyone else is just a disappointment.

31:46.448 --> 31:47.741
Wrap it up.

31:49.785 --> 31:51.578
I'm trying to be an exception.

31:52.871 --> 31:54.498
We need more of those here.

31:56.667 --> 32:01.755
All right, call the boys. Stuart here
is gonna reinvent the "Jailhouse Rock."

32:08.804 --> 32:10.389
Good to see you, Bill.

32:10.472 --> 32:11.598
You look like shit.

32:24.736 --> 32:26.989
That's it for this Sunday. God bless.

32:27.072 --> 32:29.366
- Bye, Miss Carmen.
- Bye.

32:31.535 --> 32:32.535
Hey.

32:35.497 --> 32:36.373
How's the other guy?

32:36.456 --> 32:38.292
Wasn't working
with as good a deck to start.

32:38.375 --> 32:42.296
There's no future for you here.
Or us. I...

32:42.379 --> 32:43.964
Your boss would beg to differ.

32:44.715 --> 32:46.508
You sniffing around my immigration status?

32:46.592 --> 32:48.886
I mean Jesus.
He asked for the most fucked up.

32:48.969 --> 32:49.887
You're looking at it.

32:49.970 --> 32:53.849
- He asked for the tired and the poor.
- I'm an out-of-work actor.

32:53.932 --> 32:56.351
Cheap Cologne cannot cleanse you
from the ugliness of sin.

32:56.435 --> 32:57.435
Look.

32:58.103 --> 33:00.189
I know I'm not what you're used to.

33:00.898 --> 33:02.566
Not what you deserve either.

33:03.483 --> 33:04.985
I'm gonna be better than both.

33:07.821 --> 33:12.075
I'm all my parents have to be proud of.
I can't date someone who isn't...

33:13.702 --> 33:14.870
baptized.

33:15.454 --> 33:18.457
I thought you was gonna say Hispanic.
Where's the water? I'll do it now.

33:18.540 --> 33:20.250
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

33:22.002 --> 33:23.253
I'll do it right now.

33:29.259 --> 33:32.471
The church joyfully welcomes
those who will be received

33:32.554 --> 33:34.348
into the Order of Catechumens.

33:34.431 --> 33:36.141
In the months to come,

33:36.225 --> 33:39.728
they will be preparing their initiation
into Christian faith

33:39.811 --> 33:41.730
by baptism, confirmation,

33:41.813 --> 33:43.106
and Eucharist.

33:43.190 --> 33:46.777
Stuart Long, what does
this period of formation offer you?

33:48.028 --> 33:49.238
Hard to say, Father.

33:49.321 --> 33:51.823
If I had to guess,
something beyond my wildest dreams.

33:51.907 --> 33:55.410
Let us all pray that in due time,
Stuart may be found worthy

33:55.494 --> 34:00.332
to receive the baptism of new birth,
the renewal in the Holy Spirit,

34:00.415 --> 34:02.209
and to complete his initiation

34:02.292 --> 34:05.838
through the sacraments
of confirmation and Eucharist.

34:07.089 --> 34:08.215
Hallelujah.

34:12.344 --> 34:14.554
I'd like to invite a friend
to sing with me.

34:16.598 --> 34:19.518
God gave you the talent.
It's a sin not to use it.

34:19.601 --> 34:21.812
- Give her a round of applause.
- Go.

34:21.895 --> 34:22.895
- Come on.
- Yeah.

34:25.815 --> 34:28.985
- Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.
- What song?

34:29.777 --> 34:32.864
Damn, you smell good.
Hey, Johnny Cash, "Jackson."

34:33.907 --> 34:35.909
Read the words off the television.

35:25.042 --> 35:26.042
Oh, yeah.

35:36.011 --> 35:37.054
Yeah.

35:40.849 --> 35:45.312
For example, I am gonna give up chocolate.

35:45.395 --> 35:47.940
You should protest. She needs sweetening.

35:48.607 --> 35:50.150
Yeah, pick something else.

35:51.443 --> 35:53.987
- Well, what are you gonna give up, Stu?
- Me?

35:57.741 --> 36:00.369
Maybe you guys,
so I can sleep in on Sundays.

36:00.452 --> 36:01.286
No.

36:01.370 --> 36:03.080
All right, all right.

36:05.207 --> 36:06.291
Alcohol.

36:06.875 --> 36:08.502
Hey, that's not fair.

36:08.585 --> 36:11.046
You pick something good
that you'll miss, to make it count.

36:11.129 --> 36:12.422
I like this kid.

36:14.174 --> 36:16.718
Like porn. That's what my dad gave up.

36:19.555 --> 36:22.391
Well, you tell him,
if he wants to make it count,

36:22.474 --> 36:24.309
tell your mama to give up sex.

36:24.393 --> 36:26.562
- He said S-E-X.
- That's what porn is.

36:26.645 --> 36:28.438
- Stu.
- Well, he said "porn."

36:28.522 --> 36:30.566
Kids, do you wanna read from...?

36:30.649 --> 36:32.150
- It's the same thing.
- No.

36:32.234 --> 36:33.902
Get your Bibles out, please.

36:35.863 --> 36:39.449
God wants us to give things up,
he ought to stop taking from us too.

36:39.533 --> 36:41.910
He killed my little brother Stephen
when he was 6.

36:41.994 --> 36:44.121
Took a nap, never woke up.

36:44.204 --> 36:45.873
How you square that one, huh?

36:46.915 --> 36:48.959
We can't understand
why God does what he does.

36:49.042 --> 36:52.212
That's why I liked to box.
How it went was up to me.

36:52.296 --> 36:54.631
I can't accept
when I ain't got no say in shit.

36:55.924 --> 36:59.845
Our world teaches us that there's comfort
in knowledge and fear in the unknown.

37:00.387 --> 37:03.515
What if the unknown was greater
than we could imagine?

37:04.057 --> 37:05.726
I bet it could be.

37:10.647 --> 37:11.815
I believe in you.

37:16.820 --> 37:17.820
<i>Confession.</i>

37:17.863 --> 37:22.117
Acknowledging our sins
in word, action, and omission,

37:22.201 --> 37:24.661
and resolving to not sin again.

37:24.745 --> 37:28.665
For this, we do penance,
and are granted forgiveness.

37:28.749 --> 37:31.502
Like doing laundry.
That's a Sunday thing too.

37:32.711 --> 37:34.880
Here I thought it'd be complicated.

37:34.963 --> 37:37.466
Well... I'm afraid it's not that simple.

37:37.549 --> 37:40.761
The essential part of penance

37:40.844 --> 37:43.055
is a firm and true repentance,

37:43.138 --> 37:44.806
motivated by faith,

37:44.890 --> 37:46.600
and the love of God.

37:46.683 --> 37:49.019
This is called perfect contrition.

37:49.102 --> 37:52.606
Imperfect contrition arises
from a less pure motive,

37:52.689 --> 37:54.525
such as common decency,

37:54.608 --> 37:55.859
or fear of hell.

37:55.943 --> 37:58.403
Our whole lives,
we're taught to be good, avoid bad.

37:58.487 --> 38:02.366
Eat your dinner, or you don't get dessert.
Share your toys, or you get timeout.

38:02.449 --> 38:04.785
You're trying to undo years of wiring.

38:04.868 --> 38:07.788
That's a good observation, Stuart.

38:08.539 --> 38:09.539
Take heart.

38:10.249 --> 38:12.751
God is the ultimate programmer.

38:14.878 --> 38:16.922
I leave you with this task:

38:17.005 --> 38:19.550
Consider the changes you need to make

38:19.633 --> 38:23.428
in order to receive
more abundant graces to sin no more.

38:28.600 --> 38:29.600
Cool.

38:32.855 --> 38:33.856
<i>Hello?</i>

38:33.939 --> 38:36.400
How come
you ain't teach me how to tie a tie?

38:37.609 --> 38:38.944
Where'd you get a tie?

38:39.027 --> 38:40.320
My court appearance.

38:41.029 --> 38:42.823
<i>Your dad never did like dressing up.</i>

38:42.906 --> 38:45.450
Always said he wanted me to shine.

38:46.034 --> 38:49.079
Like a dirtbag on my arm
was the only way to make me pretty.

38:49.162 --> 38:50.998
Well, Dad is a fucking asshole.

38:51.707 --> 38:53.709
<i>What you putting on a tie for?</i>

38:53.792 --> 38:54.792
Church.

38:55.419 --> 38:56.419
<i>What?</i>

38:56.837 --> 38:58.213
I'm getting baptized.

38:59.673 --> 39:00.799
Why would you do that?

39:00.883 --> 39:02.593
It means something to my girl.

39:04.178 --> 39:06.930
I remember feeling like that
about your dad.

39:07.014 --> 39:09.975
Why? You wanna be reborn,
because you fucked up so bad marrying him?

39:10.058 --> 39:12.477
Like I'd do anything to please him,

39:13.020 --> 39:14.771
when he could be pleased.

39:14.855 --> 39:17.149
Gonna help me with this thing or what?

39:17.232 --> 39:19.610
I keep tying the damn thing into a knot.

39:20.277 --> 39:21.653
Mama, I need your help.

40:22.965 --> 40:23.965
Hey.

40:34.184 --> 40:35.561
What's everybody waiting for?

40:36.854 --> 40:38.105
Let's pray.

40:39.147 --> 40:39.982
I'll do it.

40:40.065 --> 40:41.275
It'd be my pleasure.

40:42.651 --> 40:43.902
I've been practicing.

40:59.376 --> 41:00.376
Amen.

41:03.422 --> 41:04.548
You know, Stuart,

41:05.507 --> 41:06.717
in my country,

41:07.593 --> 41:09.595
men crawl on their hands and knees

41:09.678 --> 41:13.182
to the statue <i>a la santísima Virgen María.</i>

41:15.309 --> 41:17.728
I expect no less devotion to my daughter.

41:23.942 --> 41:25.819
It's a good thing I got a carpet, huh?

41:33.202 --> 41:34.286
You like that one?

41:37.789 --> 41:39.124
You want <i>cerveza?</i>

41:40.375 --> 41:44.546
No, I don't drink. I was just wondering...
If you drink, I can get it. But I don't...

41:45.297 --> 41:46.297
I don't drink.

41:51.303 --> 41:55.265
I've never done this before.
I just rattle off the ways I fucked up?

41:55.849 --> 41:57.351
That is correct.

41:57.434 --> 42:00.229
Easier to list the things I done right,
take up less of your time.

42:00.771 --> 42:02.272
Take as long as you need.

42:02.356 --> 42:04.858
There's a line out there.
They'll know how much I fucked up.

42:04.942 --> 42:07.528
Unless you whisper,
they'll know regardless.

42:08.654 --> 42:11.990
- You know who you're talking to?
- I have an inkling, yes.

42:12.074 --> 42:15.494
Does hearing other folks' shit make you
feel less shitty about your own shit?

42:15.577 --> 42:17.829
Don't pretend like you don't got some.

42:19.206 --> 42:20.999
It is for God alone to judge.

42:21.542 --> 42:25.087
I am merely a vessel
to assist man in unburdening himself

42:25.170 --> 42:28.799
of all that may separate him
from the most direct path

42:28.882 --> 42:30.300
to Almighty Father.

42:30.384 --> 42:32.010
I'm keeping God in a job.

42:32.094 --> 42:34.471
He cuts you a check,
your ass better thank me.

42:42.479 --> 42:45.274
Last thing I need
is another father to fail for.

42:58.954 --> 43:02.165
You're getting into the fine print
on this way of living, pal.

43:03.375 --> 43:04.793
What you think you know?

43:05.419 --> 43:09.298
I know you got a long,
weary road ahead, with the headlights dim.

43:09.381 --> 43:12.092
You have to learn the hard way
how to live in light.

43:12.634 --> 43:15.179
Why don't you find someone else
who wants to hear your shit?

43:15.262 --> 43:16.388
No one wants to.

43:16.471 --> 43:17.556
No shit.

43:18.223 --> 43:19.223
Take a hint.

43:21.185 --> 43:25.314
In my experience, the toughest fights
are the only ones worth walking into.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.650
You bring a tough guy to his knees,

43:29.651 --> 43:31.862
the first few times he feels shame.

43:33.447 --> 43:34.448
Rage.

43:36.700 --> 43:38.160
Eventually, relief.

43:40.579 --> 43:42.080
Wanna have a big dick contest, bud?

43:43.081 --> 43:44.833
I know how big your dick is, son.

43:48.337 --> 43:50.422
I'd fuck you up
if you weren't fucked up already.

43:50.506 --> 43:51.507
Yeah.

43:52.132 --> 43:53.509
Someone beat you to it.

43:56.720 --> 44:00.766
Life's gonna give you
a gutful of reasons to be angry, kid.

44:02.267 --> 44:04.978
You only need one to be grateful.

44:08.232 --> 44:09.733
That's the most fucked-up ratio

44:09.816 --> 44:12.277
since the number
of marshmallows in Lucky Charms.

44:14.363 --> 44:15.739
You ain't owed nothing.

44:17.449 --> 44:19.117
But you're getting a chance.

44:22.621 --> 44:23.956
Don't go driving now.

44:29.336 --> 44:30.838
The fuck was he drinking?

44:31.672 --> 44:32.673
Water.

44:57.781 --> 44:59.074
Oh, shit.

45:25.309 --> 45:26.685
Sir?

45:28.228 --> 45:30.439
Can you hear me?

45:33.150 --> 45:34.484
Can you hear me?

45:49.917 --> 45:51.251
Behold thy mother.

46:02.638 --> 46:04.097
You must listen to me.

46:04.932 --> 46:06.934
You will not die for nothing.

46:11.688 --> 46:13.106
Oh, you tell your son...

46:15.317 --> 46:18.028
he wants to show me hell,
I ain't afraid of a little fire.

46:20.531 --> 46:21.823
He died for you.

46:24.493 --> 46:25.577
For Stephen.

47:15.794 --> 47:20.424
There was significant trauma to the head,
and vital organs. He's in a coma.

47:20.507 --> 47:22.426
If there's anyone
you'd like to see him again,

47:22.509 --> 47:24.428
I suggest you arrange that now.

47:24.511 --> 47:25.511
I...

47:26.555 --> 47:28.390
already lost one kid.

47:29.683 --> 47:32.895
They say lightning
don't strike the same place twice.

47:33.478 --> 47:35.772
The nurse can recommend a grief counselor.

48:06.553 --> 48:08.514
- God bless.
- Bye, Miss Carmen.

48:08.597 --> 48:09.890
- Bye.
- See you next Sunday.

48:41.505 --> 48:45.133
You got some kind of spell in there
gonna bring him back?

48:46.093 --> 48:48.595
It's just a prayer
for Mary's intercession.

48:48.679 --> 48:53.392
She don't give a good goddamn
about a real mother's son.

48:56.144 --> 48:57.771
You should get some rest.

48:58.897 --> 49:00.524
I could stay with him.

49:05.612 --> 49:06.947
His eyes are moving.

49:07.656 --> 49:09.366
What? Doctor!

49:11.034 --> 49:12.578
Stuart, baby.

49:13.161 --> 49:14.413
Can you hear me?

49:31.471 --> 49:32.890
Can you squeeze my hand?

49:34.600 --> 49:36.518
He's starting to come out of it.

49:57.122 --> 49:58.624
Damn thing ate my dollar.

50:00.626 --> 50:04.254
As if folks in here ain't paid enough,
you gotta bleed their pockets too.

50:06.173 --> 50:08.634
- Ain't you brought your own beverage?
- Son of a...

50:09.343 --> 50:11.428
- Where you going?
- What's it to you?

50:11.512 --> 50:13.597
Your mother told me you were dying.
What the fuck?

50:14.181 --> 50:15.807
You sound disappointed.

50:15.891 --> 50:19.269
Well, I took off work to be here.
You seem all right.

50:20.062 --> 50:21.063
Wait up, Stu.

50:23.232 --> 50:24.733
I forgot to give you this.

50:26.443 --> 50:28.362
St. Joseph. For the operation.

50:29.404 --> 50:30.405
Who's this?

50:30.989 --> 50:31.990
Who's asking?

50:32.074 --> 50:33.074
Stu's dad.

50:34.743 --> 50:36.995
I'm Carmen, Stuart's girlfriend.

50:37.913 --> 50:39.540
She know you're an atheist?

50:41.917 --> 50:43.377
He's baptized.

50:46.672 --> 50:49.466
He ain't dead.
He can speak for himself. Is that true?

50:52.094 --> 50:53.094
Yeah.

50:58.267 --> 51:00.602
- You know St. Stephen?
- Of course.

51:00.686 --> 51:02.938
Patron Saint of coffin makers.

51:03.480 --> 51:06.733
There's pictures of him
with a big pile of rocks on his head.

51:07.317 --> 51:08.151
Who'd have thought,

51:08.235 --> 51:10.696
you give your boy a nice Christian name,

51:12.072 --> 51:13.615
in a world full of fruits and nuts,

51:13.699 --> 51:15.993
you'd sentence him
to live right on up to it?

51:16.535 --> 51:17.744
Or down, as it were.

51:18.704 --> 51:19.746
Into the ground.

51:19.830 --> 51:21.456
That ain't how names work.

51:25.752 --> 51:27.212
Let me drive you home, Mr. Long.

51:27.296 --> 51:29.673
Hey, you got yourself a worrier.

51:32.676 --> 51:35.053
God will put me where he wants me to be.

51:35.137 --> 51:37.181
What's it to you
if I'm in hell or Hermosillo?

51:37.264 --> 51:38.264
"Sillo."

51:38.891 --> 51:39.891
Can we go?

52:05.918 --> 52:08.712
<i>You recall the guy who was drinking
by me, last time I was here?</i>

52:09.254 --> 52:12.758
I haven't seen him before or since.
He was probably just passing through.

52:26.772 --> 52:29.858
<i>You ain't owed nothing,
but you're getting a chance.</i>

52:32.444 --> 52:33.862
<i>Don't go driving now.</i>

52:47.042 --> 52:48.710
I thought I could help.

52:51.213 --> 52:53.048
Answer your question, you know.

52:55.133 --> 52:57.010
Yeah? What you think I'm wondering?

52:58.345 --> 52:59.345
"Why me?

53:00.681 --> 53:03.725
Why did God make or allow this to happen?"

53:04.309 --> 53:06.311
He doesn't promise
your stories will make sense,

53:06.395 --> 53:09.648
but he does promise
they'll find their greater purpose.

53:09.731 --> 53:10.858
If we're patient.

53:10.941 --> 53:11.941
Patient?

53:12.734 --> 53:14.069
You an expert on that.

53:22.160 --> 53:23.954
What's going on with you?

53:24.037 --> 53:26.582
Most things get squished on a road,
end up stuffed on a wall.

53:26.665 --> 53:28.250
I'm doing pretty good, considering.

53:28.333 --> 53:30.919
I know, but I'm concerned.

53:31.003 --> 53:33.046
I got a lot on my mind, all right?

53:35.716 --> 53:37.384
Let me help you take it off.

53:45.017 --> 53:46.018
Don't do this.

53:48.187 --> 53:49.521
I know what I'm doing.

53:58.447 --> 54:00.199
<i>Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>

54:00.824 --> 54:03.660
It's been six weeks
since my last confession.

54:03.744 --> 54:04.745
I can't...

54:05.871 --> 54:08.874
I can't give you details on account
of there's a conflict of interest.

54:09.708 --> 54:12.628
The sacrament of confession is inviolable.

54:12.711 --> 54:15.088
I cannot, under pain of excommunication,

54:15.172 --> 54:18.091
reveal or act on
whatever it is you confess to me.

54:20.427 --> 54:23.055
I did something I ain't supposed to do.

54:24.640 --> 54:28.018
Something I been thinking about,
praying I could get to happen for months.

54:28.560 --> 54:31.480
Something I wanted
more than anything else in this world.

54:32.022 --> 54:35.609
Then I had it, and all I could do
was think about disappointing God.

54:35.692 --> 54:36.777
This is good news.

54:37.528 --> 54:40.405
It is
in discovering the greatness of God's love

54:40.489 --> 54:44.409
that our heart is shaken
by the horror and weight of sin.

54:44.493 --> 54:48.413
No, this ain't about fucking up.
It's about being fucked with.

54:50.582 --> 54:53.752
Another term for that is "grace."

54:53.836 --> 54:55.212
God's grace.

54:55.295 --> 54:57.548
It appears you are the recipient.

54:57.631 --> 54:59.675
What's he expecting me
to do with his grace?

54:59.758 --> 55:01.176
You could start by...

55:01.969 --> 55:03.220
cleaning up your language.

55:03.303 --> 55:06.098
Don't be a wise-ass, Father.
Answer the question.

55:07.307 --> 55:10.310
He expects you
to spread his word,

55:10.394 --> 55:11.687
advance his kingdom.

55:12.271 --> 55:14.606
He ain't making house calls asking that.

55:18.819 --> 55:20.779
He must have made a mistake.

55:20.863 --> 55:21.863
No.

55:23.115 --> 55:25.325
God doesn't make mistakes.

55:30.914 --> 55:34.209
Father G thinks maybe I could serve God.
You believe that shit?

55:35.836 --> 55:36.920
Like an altar boy?

55:37.004 --> 55:39.798
I've been thinking that
since the day I met you.

55:39.882 --> 55:41.216
- You have?
- No.

55:44.553 --> 55:46.972
But I'm sure he had good reason.

55:50.350 --> 55:52.477
My whole life,
I felt like I shouldn't be here.

55:52.561 --> 55:54.897
That my brother Stephen should instead.

55:56.023 --> 55:58.358
But after that night, I felt different.

55:59.568 --> 56:01.570
Like I might be good
for something after all.

56:03.280 --> 56:06.241
Perhaps the world needs
another Rhinestone Cowboy.

56:11.330 --> 56:14.166
I think
God saw something in you worth saving.

56:14.875 --> 56:18.003
But it's up to you
to decide what you've got to offer.

57:19.982 --> 57:22.359
I thought it'd make sense
being back here to do this.

57:22.943 --> 57:24.987
It's the place
you told me you believed in me.

57:33.871 --> 57:35.205
I'm gonna be a priest.

57:40.669 --> 57:41.670
What do you mean?

57:43.964 --> 57:46.175
It's five words.
I've practiced them a hundred times.

57:46.258 --> 57:47.509
What part is unclear?

57:49.094 --> 57:50.094
Every part.

57:51.972 --> 57:53.056
You're gonna be a priest?

57:53.140 --> 57:54.725
Stop saying it like that.

57:54.808 --> 57:56.602
Like what? Like it's insane?

57:56.685 --> 57:58.937
So was the idea
of the man upstairs pulling strings,

57:59.021 --> 58:01.148
but you bought that like a pair of shoes.

58:02.316 --> 58:05.527
God saved me and forgave me
to show me that there's a reason I'm here.

58:05.611 --> 58:07.738
We need to have your head examined.

58:07.821 --> 58:08.989
Trust me, Carmen.

58:09.072 --> 58:12.743
I tried every way to talk myself
out of it, but the truth is...

58:13.285 --> 58:15.078
I ain't never been more clear.

58:18.040 --> 58:20.250
Have you considered all this entails?

58:21.001 --> 58:23.629
Abstaining from booze and beatings,
not to mention sex?

58:23.712 --> 58:26.673
- You showed me I could do it.
- No, I showed you, you could wait.

58:26.757 --> 58:29.343
A vow of celibacy means never again.
Then you die.

58:29.426 --> 58:31.845
There's more to life than sex.
I can feel it.

58:31.929 --> 58:33.263
Most people know that.

58:33.347 --> 58:37.351
Only most people find
that other meaning in a passion,

58:37.434 --> 58:38.727
or people,

58:38.810 --> 58:40.103
or a family.

58:40.187 --> 58:42.814
- You're setting yourself up for failure.
- No.

58:42.898 --> 58:44.650
I been testing myself.

58:44.733 --> 58:48.820
If God's willing to forgive me,
I got to be willing to forgive others.

58:48.904 --> 58:51.281
Whoever hit me,
I wanted their dicks on a stick.

58:51.365 --> 58:53.742
But with God's help, I've forgiven them.

58:53.825 --> 58:56.411
And you think the absence
of the instinct to dismember someone

58:56.495 --> 58:58.747
qualifies you for priesthood?

58:58.830 --> 59:01.124
- You're delusional.
- Know what it takes to win a fight?

59:01.208 --> 59:05.254
You gotta turn off the animal brain,
use logic, humility, good judgment.

59:05.337 --> 59:08.632
That's the struggle of man.
I can do it. I can help.

59:10.926 --> 59:13.095
You got near death and found God.

59:13.679 --> 59:15.264
That's great, Stu, but...

59:17.057 --> 59:18.684
this is a little extreme.

59:18.767 --> 59:20.561
No, I didn't find him, Carmen.

59:21.144 --> 59:22.144
I felt him.

59:22.521 --> 59:25.315
I felt her. Mary.
Well, that don't sound...

59:25.399 --> 59:28.944
Look, the feeling she gave me,
I can't even explain it.

59:29.027 --> 59:32.781
For the first time in my life,
I knew I could stop fighting.

59:32.865 --> 59:35.158
I knew I was safe and loved.

59:47.212 --> 59:49.590
I disgraced myself before God,

59:50.507 --> 59:52.759
so that
you could have another flight of fancy.

59:52.843 --> 59:54.511
I know you're mad. Hit me if you want.

59:54.595 --> 59:56.763
- It'll make you feel better.
- I don't wanna hit you.

59:58.348 --> 59:59.683
I wanna marry you.

01:00:00.726 --> 01:00:03.395
I thought
that's what you brought me here for.

01:00:06.899 --> 01:00:07.899
I can't do that.

01:00:09.902 --> 01:00:10.902
I'm sorry.

01:00:12.613 --> 01:00:13.447
Carmen.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:14.530
Car...

01:00:15.616 --> 01:00:16.616
Damn.

01:00:23.665 --> 01:00:25.834
Your son is about to make a huge mistake.

01:00:25.918 --> 01:00:27.920
He don't usually warn no one,

01:00:28.003 --> 01:00:30.214
so I guess that's progress.

01:00:30.297 --> 01:00:33.050
You talked him out of boxing, right?

01:00:33.133 --> 01:00:34.133
Hey, Mama.

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:38.055
Is someone gonna tell me what's going on?

01:00:38.138 --> 01:00:40.390
I was gonna find a better time.

01:00:40.974 --> 01:00:43.393
- You're doing a porno?
- No, God, no.

01:00:43.477 --> 01:00:45.020
No, I'm gonna be a priest.

01:00:46.355 --> 01:00:49.399
- For Halloween?
- No, not for fucking Halloween. For real.

01:00:50.776 --> 01:00:52.236
Oh, Stu.

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:54.446
You can't be serious.

01:00:55.239 --> 01:00:56.073
This is your fault.

01:00:56.156 --> 01:00:58.867
You'd think I said
I wanted to be a serial killer.

01:00:58.951 --> 01:01:02.829
My son don't do half measures.
He's a dog with a goddamn bone.

01:01:02.913 --> 01:01:06.834
If you're so fucking enlightened,
you should've seen that.

01:01:08.252 --> 01:01:11.964
Had you been awake enough
to dignify his place in this world,

01:01:12.047 --> 01:01:14.550
in spite of the loss of your other son,

01:01:14.633 --> 01:01:17.177
he wouldn't be so desperate
to find himself.

01:01:17.261 --> 01:01:18.261
Baby, don't...

01:01:27.437 --> 01:01:28.564
I'm doing this.

01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:39.575
"To whom it may concern,
consider this application to the seminary.

01:01:39.658 --> 01:01:42.744
Enclosed you'll find my résumé,

01:01:42.828 --> 01:01:45.831
and half the fee.

01:01:45.914 --> 01:01:48.625
God will provide the rest cause."

01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:49.709
Cause?

01:01:50.919 --> 01:01:54.131
Oh, "'cause I'm praying for it."

01:01:56.091 --> 01:01:57.091
'Cause.

01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:05.350
Hey, Mama, I'm home.

01:02:05.434 --> 01:02:08.353
Hey, Stuart.
I just been admiring your artwork.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.192
- You invite him here?
- He came to check on you.

01:02:13.817 --> 01:02:16.737
You look about as holy as a healthy deuce.

01:02:17.362 --> 01:02:18.572
You had to tell him?

01:02:19.239 --> 01:02:21.783
- It's a sin to lie.
- You ain't the Catholic here.

01:02:21.867 --> 01:02:23.952
You've had some nutty ideas before,

01:02:24.036 --> 01:02:28.040
but this is like Hitler
asking to join the ADL.

01:02:28.123 --> 01:02:31.126
All these years, I was looking
for the wrong father's approval.

01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:32.461
I never needed yours.

01:02:32.544 --> 01:02:34.922
I always loved you
for the piece of shit you were.

01:02:35.005 --> 01:02:36.340
That's unconditional.

01:02:36.924 --> 01:02:37.924
It's obligation.

01:02:38.425 --> 01:02:39.801
You're punishing yourself.

01:02:39.885 --> 01:02:42.304
You've both been, since Stephen died.

01:02:42.387 --> 01:02:44.640
It's not punishment, it's purpose.

01:02:44.723 --> 01:02:47.059
Let me do one last thing as your dad.

01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:50.938
- Give you something you always wanted.
- What the fuck?

01:02:51.021 --> 01:02:53.732
You gonna disgrace me
and your brother like this,

01:02:53.815 --> 01:02:55.609
you might as well Bury me too.

01:02:58.111 --> 01:03:01.990
I'm turning my life around.
There ain't shit you could do to stop me.

01:03:02.074 --> 01:03:05.160
Unless you wanna shoot me.
Dine out on two dead kids.

01:03:05.244 --> 01:03:06.954
Oh, to hell with both of you.

01:03:07.037 --> 01:03:09.289
I trust we'll both find our way.

01:03:17.005 --> 01:03:19.383
You both better be gone when I get back.

01:04:29.953 --> 01:04:30.954
Excuse me, sir?

01:04:31.038 --> 01:04:32.664
Do you have an appointment?

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:34.290
Yes.

01:04:36.543 --> 01:04:38.545
Take care, Jeff. All the best.

01:04:39.338 --> 01:04:40.339
Go on.

01:04:42.382 --> 01:04:43.382
Hey.

01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:50.766
- You're the IOU.
- You know something, Father?

01:04:50.849 --> 01:04:53.560
There's a sign on the wall
of my gym back home.

01:04:53.644 --> 01:04:56.772
"Hope is not a tactic."
I took that one to heart.

01:04:57.356 --> 01:04:59.816
Fought for everything I earned.
This ain't no different.

01:05:00.817 --> 01:05:04.988
I know what God's doing here.
Seeing how I respond, I don't get my way.

01:05:05.072 --> 01:05:06.990
I'd be red-assed about it.

01:05:07.574 --> 01:05:09.159
But I ain't giving up.

01:05:09.243 --> 01:05:11.203
Not on him or me.

01:05:12.204 --> 01:05:14.289
I want you to reconsider your rejection.

01:05:15.165 --> 01:05:18.585
There's nothing on your résumé
or in your references

01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:23.882
that speaks to behavioral conformity
with Catholic tradition.

01:05:24.842 --> 01:05:27.553
You are a pugilist with a criminal record.

01:05:27.636 --> 01:05:30.472
Look at St. Matthew,
St. Augustine, St. Francis.

01:05:30.556 --> 01:05:32.057
Some of the most remarkable figures

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.518
in the history
of the Church are reformed men.

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:38.105
Yes, but I think
what the Church needs now,

01:05:38.188 --> 01:05:39.188
more than ever,

01:05:39.648 --> 01:05:42.150
is to elevate the standard for a priest.

01:05:42.234 --> 01:05:44.820
No, the Church needs somebody
who's gonna fight for God.

01:05:44.903 --> 01:05:45.903
That's me.

01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:50.284
Besides, if the Church's choices don't
celebrate a person's capacity for change,

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:52.327
then what else does it stand for?

01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:55.497
This may sound contradictory,

01:05:55.581 --> 01:05:59.293
but sometimes the best path to serving God

01:05:59.376 --> 01:06:02.087
is to step out of the way.

01:06:02.171 --> 01:06:05.048
With all due respect, monsignor,
you're getting in my way.

01:06:05.132 --> 01:06:06.633
God wants me here.

01:06:10.846 --> 01:06:15.100
Priests become the financial
responsibility of the Church.

01:06:15.184 --> 01:06:17.352
Now, by admitting you,

01:06:17.895 --> 01:06:20.981
we'd be agreeing to subsidize you

01:06:21.064 --> 01:06:23.483
as the face of Catholicism.

01:06:24.151 --> 01:06:27.863
Something our board
would be very reluctant to do.

01:06:27.946 --> 01:06:30.741
First it's admitting
you're afraid I'll succeed.

01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:35.913
If you so sure
I'll flame out, what you got to lose?

01:06:58.685 --> 01:07:00.646
- My man.
- Hey.

01:07:00.729 --> 01:07:02.314
Look at you. What?

01:07:02.397 --> 01:07:06.693
- The first of many inappropriate displays.
- Outward sign of inward grace.

01:07:06.777 --> 01:07:08.695
- And a hug from the heart.
- Hugs are healing.

01:07:08.779 --> 01:07:11.281
Jesus hugged a cripple,
that mother-hugger would walk.

01:07:11.365 --> 01:07:12.365
I need another one.

01:07:13.367 --> 01:07:16.495
Entering these gates, you surrender
any personal means of purchase.

01:07:16.578 --> 01:07:20.707
We rely on our sponsors for money.
You do have one of those, don't you?

01:07:20.791 --> 01:07:22.042
Don't worry about me.

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:24.211
I been getting sponsorships
since I could swing.

01:07:26.046 --> 01:07:28.715
By the time I leave,
I'll have Jesus' name on my trunks.

01:07:29.424 --> 01:07:31.677
You can keep your driver's license
and insurance card.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.971
They took my license,
canceled my insurance.

01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:36.390
You doubted me, and I'm a step ahead.

01:07:36.473 --> 01:07:37.474
God bless you.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.397
It is my great privilege

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.900
to welcome you
to the stewardship of theology.

01:07:46.984 --> 01:07:52.072
You are here to learn
that you will one day be a teacher.

01:07:52.155 --> 01:07:53.323
An advisor.

01:07:53.907 --> 01:07:55.200
A confessor.

01:07:55.784 --> 01:07:58.203
Indeed, a Father.

01:08:00.414 --> 01:08:01.415
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:09.131 --> 01:08:10.632
I guess we're gonna be roommates.

01:08:16.095 --> 01:08:17.220
Sixteen?

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:18.890
Sixteen.

01:08:22.227 --> 01:08:24.104
They must've given me a faulty one.

01:08:24.188 --> 01:08:27.191
It's user error.
And it's like 2 in the morning.

01:08:27.274 --> 01:08:29.859
I ain't going down till I get this right.

01:08:29.943 --> 01:08:32.112
There is no MVP of Consecration.

01:08:32.196 --> 01:08:33.947
Of course there is. Jesus.

01:08:34.031 --> 01:08:36.325
You wanna sleep, help a brother out.

01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:39.493
And be complicit in your ruse?
Not over my dead body.

01:08:39.578 --> 01:08:41.537
I'll ring your bell,
show you how that's done.

01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:45.167
You're a fraud.

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:48.921
I found God. I ain't here for fellowship.
I'm here for worship.

01:08:49.004 --> 01:08:50.923
That's a great bumper sticker.

01:08:59.723 --> 01:09:02.434
"Take this, all of you, drink from it,

01:09:02.518 --> 01:09:04.770
for this is the chalice of my blood,

01:09:04.853 --> 01:09:08.023
the blood of the new
and eternal covenant."

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:09.649
<i>I been thinking.</i>

01:09:10.609 --> 01:09:12.528
Probably wise to keep a vice on hand.

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:15.197
Somebody too perfect,
they a target for the devil.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:18.658
"Better to be silent, be thought a fool,
than to talk and remove all doubt."

01:09:19.743 --> 01:09:21.578
While we're bandying idioms.

01:09:22.203 --> 01:09:24.540
If Jesus wasn't afraid to look a fool,
why should I be?

01:09:24.622 --> 01:09:27.334
If you seek to be Christlike,
give us something worth repeating.

01:09:27.917 --> 01:09:29.169
That is the duty of a priest.

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:31.671
One that you prove daily
you're incapable of performing.

01:09:31.755 --> 01:09:35.425
Not just what he does that makes a man
a priest. It's also what he doesn't do.

01:09:35.509 --> 01:09:38.636
- He ain't laid you out yet.
- Oh, that's charming.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.720
Not yet.

01:09:40.973 --> 01:09:42.307
Watch your man.

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:43.225
Oh, no, Stu.

01:09:43.308 --> 01:09:44.725
Oh, no, Stu.

01:09:48.647 --> 01:09:49.564
You look tired.

01:09:49.648 --> 01:09:52.776
Give me a second.
I'm out of shape. And you're Black.

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:54.152
I thought you were an athlete.

01:09:54.236 --> 01:09:56.029
- I'm gonna take five. Sub in for me.
- What?

01:09:56.113 --> 01:09:57.781
Let me catch my breath, man.

01:09:57.865 --> 01:09:58.865
Shit.

01:10:00.951 --> 01:10:01.951
Hey.

01:10:03.245 --> 01:10:04.245
You want in?

01:10:06.206 --> 01:10:07.875
Does it look like I want in?

01:10:13.547 --> 01:10:17.551
- Trying to rise above here, man.
- A priest is penitent, not playful.

01:10:18.135 --> 01:10:20.429
How you think
Moses lasted in the desert 40 years?

01:10:20.512 --> 01:10:21.597
He must've been in shape.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.348
Priest got to be prepared.

01:10:23.432 --> 01:10:25.642
I don't suppose
Jesus appreciates your mockery.

01:10:25.726 --> 01:10:27.853
God gave us a sense of humor
so we'd use it.

01:10:27.936 --> 01:10:30.314
I don't know how to play, all right?

01:10:30.397 --> 01:10:32.608
My father didn't see the point
in teaching me sports.

01:10:32.691 --> 01:10:34.026
I was always gonna be a priest.

01:10:34.109 --> 01:10:36.069
It ain't never too late to learn.

01:10:36.904 --> 01:10:40.115
Not everyone is as eager
to humiliate themselves as you are.

01:10:40.991 --> 01:10:43.785
Through his own son's shame
was God's glory magnified.

01:10:43.869 --> 01:10:45.537
Jesus set the bar, brother.

01:10:45.621 --> 01:10:48.665
No one wants to hear the Gospel
from the mouth of a gangster.

01:10:50.584 --> 01:10:52.753
Maybe that's exactly what they need.

01:10:53.545 --> 01:10:54.671
I'm coming back.

01:10:56.882 --> 01:11:00.135
"For God so loved the world,
that he gave his only son,

01:11:00.219 --> 01:11:02.346
so that everyone who believes in him

01:11:02.429 --> 01:11:05.140
might not perish,
but might have eternal life."

01:11:05.224 --> 01:11:08.644
- The Gospel of the Lord.
- Praise to the Lord Jesus Christ.

01:11:11.188 --> 01:11:15.192
It is a great pleasure to introduce
a member of our parish family,

01:11:15.275 --> 01:11:16.568
now a seminarian,

01:11:16.652 --> 01:11:18.570
to deliver today's reflection.

01:11:25.911 --> 01:11:26.911
Hey.

01:11:43.303 --> 01:11:45.931
"Forgive them, Father,
for they know not what they do."

01:11:49.351 --> 01:11:51.311
That's what Jesus said on the cross.

01:11:53.897 --> 01:11:54.897
As a kid,

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:56.859
I saw a dude in a diaper,

01:11:56.942 --> 01:11:59.862
getting it worse than me
with my daddy's belt when he was drunk.

01:12:00.404 --> 01:12:03.615
But I figured,
I could never screw up as bad as Jesus.

01:12:03.699 --> 01:12:05.617
Whatever he did to deserve that.

01:12:07.119 --> 01:12:11.456
And as a man, I thought,
"You know what? It serves him right.

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:12.708
Trying to lie to the world,

01:12:12.791 --> 01:12:16.044
make us think we gotta kiss his feet
for a pat on the head."

01:12:16.962 --> 01:12:21.842
Look, now, we've all been wronged,
and we've all done some wronging.

01:12:22.885 --> 01:12:24.595
Some of us worse than others.

01:12:25.179 --> 01:12:27.181
But with them words I said up top,

01:12:27.973 --> 01:12:30.100
Jesus asked his father, God,

01:12:31.018 --> 01:12:33.395
to forgive the folks tacking him up.

01:12:33.979 --> 01:12:36.106
He ain't come to condemn the world,

01:12:36.190 --> 01:12:38.442
make us cower in shame for our sins.

01:12:40.444 --> 01:12:41.778
He came to forgive us.

01:12:43.363 --> 01:12:44.364
Think about it.

01:12:45.157 --> 01:12:48.785
We ask Jesus to forgive us our trespasses

01:12:48.869 --> 01:12:52.122
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:12:54.208 --> 01:12:58.587
God's forgiveness
is contingent upon us forgiving others.

01:12:58.670 --> 01:12:59.838
That's the deal.

01:13:01.131 --> 01:13:02.341
It ain't easy to do.

01:13:03.258 --> 01:13:04.258
Truth is,

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.054
we ain't got no power to do it ourselves.

01:13:07.596 --> 01:13:08.931
None of us, not a one.

01:13:10.265 --> 01:13:11.642
It's all God's grace.

01:13:13.477 --> 01:13:14.811
That's the man, right there.

01:13:16.772 --> 01:13:18.315
You just gotta let him in.

01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:21.193
He'll do the heavy lifting.

01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:24.488
Amen.

01:13:26.865 --> 01:13:28.075
Hey.

01:13:28.659 --> 01:13:30.494
Hey, wait up. Hey.

01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:32.704
You're out of shape.

01:13:32.788 --> 01:13:34.665
I'm out of practice chasing after you.

01:13:34.748 --> 01:13:37.125
You're spiritually blackmailing me.

01:13:37.209 --> 01:13:38.126
What?

01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:40.379
Reminding me
God forgives those who forgive others,

01:13:40.462 --> 01:13:43.590
chasing me down to demand it,
all for you to make yourself feel better.

01:13:43.674 --> 01:13:45.008
It'll make you feel better too.

01:13:45.092 --> 01:13:48.011
There's nothing to forgive.
We serve the same God.

01:13:49.847 --> 01:13:50.973
You seeing someone?

01:13:51.932 --> 01:13:54.309
You really are a glutton for punishment.

01:14:03.402 --> 01:14:06.029
- You asked to see me, Father?
- Yes, yes.

01:14:06.113 --> 01:14:07.739
As a matter of fact, I did.

01:14:09.366 --> 01:14:13.078
It's come to my attention
that there was a woman in your life,

01:14:13.161 --> 01:14:15.789
prior to you entering the seminary.

01:14:15.873 --> 01:14:18.834
I was wondering,
are you still in contact with her?

01:14:18.917 --> 01:14:24.381
No, not really. I mean, she don't want
much to do with a man she can't marry.

01:14:24.464 --> 01:14:27.217
You know how Catholic girls are.
Or maybe you don't.

01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:32.639
You strike me as the kind of man for whom
rejection only strengthens resolve.

01:14:32.723 --> 01:14:35.142
Oh, don't ask me where I got that notion.

01:14:37.102 --> 01:14:39.062
Do you still think about her?

01:14:40.105 --> 01:14:41.105
Of course I do.

01:14:41.773 --> 01:14:43.650
Sexuality's a gift from God.

01:14:43.734 --> 01:14:46.570
And denying it
is denying something he wanted us to have.

01:14:46.653 --> 01:14:48.780
It's what you do with it that matters.

01:14:49.323 --> 01:14:51.783
Well, I appreciate your candor.

01:14:51.867 --> 01:14:54.203
Anyway, I just want you to know,

01:14:54.286 --> 01:14:58.290
I'm always here,
if you need to talk, or you're struggling.

01:14:58.373 --> 01:15:00.209
Too kind, too kind.

01:15:00.292 --> 01:15:03.962
You know,
it ain't a giving up, it's a giving for.

01:15:04.046 --> 01:15:07.799
Like anything, it's the struggle
that brings you closer to God.

01:15:07.883 --> 01:15:09.843
I never shied away from no fight.

01:15:11.386 --> 01:15:13.138
Teaching priests to rat on suffering men,

01:15:13.222 --> 01:15:15.224
they're getting closer to Judas
than Jesus.

01:15:15.766 --> 01:15:17.726
We both know how that story ends.

01:15:20.395 --> 01:15:21.395
Don't we?

01:16:07.067 --> 01:16:07.901
<i>Hey.</i>

01:16:07.985 --> 01:16:10.404
- Go, go, go.
- Right here, right here.

01:16:11.446 --> 01:16:13.490
- Hey.
- Come on, man, let's go.

01:16:14.324 --> 01:16:15.367
Shit.

01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:16.450
Hey.

01:16:17.828 --> 01:16:19.746
- Yo, I got you, I got you.
- Hey.

01:16:20.289 --> 01:16:21.915
- Wait, wait.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:23.959
Hey, you all right, man?

01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.838
I ain't playing possum,
if that's what you're asking.

01:16:35.596 --> 01:16:37.556
Let me try again. Help me up.

01:16:39.474 --> 01:16:40.851
Let's go slow. Go slow.

01:16:41.935 --> 01:16:43.562
All right, just take a sec.

01:16:43.645 --> 01:16:44.645
Guys, hey.

01:16:46.982 --> 01:16:49.109
Dude, you okay? You okay, man?

01:16:49.693 --> 01:16:50.944
- Yeah.
- Come on.

01:16:51.528 --> 01:16:53.322
Come on. There you go.

01:17:03.498 --> 01:17:04.541
Oh, shit.

01:17:06.793 --> 01:17:09.004
- You there, ten-four?
- <i>Yes, Stu.</i>

01:17:09.087 --> 01:17:10.172
<i>Still here.</i>

01:17:10.923 --> 01:17:12.049
Roger that.

01:17:12.132 --> 01:17:13.133
Oh, shit.

01:17:20.474 --> 01:17:22.351
Is that that nurse out there? You there?

01:17:25.479 --> 01:17:26.563
Hello?

01:17:28.023 --> 01:17:29.483
Anybody out there?

01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:33.362
Oh, my God.

01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:38.242
Oh, Stuart, I apologize for the delay.

01:17:38.325 --> 01:17:40.827
I had several specialists
conferring over your lab reports.

01:17:40.911 --> 01:17:43.330
No worries, doc.
I got the feeling back. I think I'm good.

01:17:43.413 --> 01:17:45.040
Okay, look.

01:17:45.999 --> 01:17:49.169
There's no easy way to deliver this news,

01:17:49.253 --> 01:17:52.965
but you don't strike me
as somebody who needs sugarcoating.

01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:55.550
All right?

01:17:56.426 --> 01:17:59.471
You have a progressive muscle disorder.

01:17:59.555 --> 01:18:02.558
It's called inclusion body myositis.
It's very rare.

01:18:03.392 --> 01:18:05.936
Symptoms are like ALS,
Lou Gehrig's disease,

01:18:06.019 --> 01:18:10.148
where the muscles continue
to weaken until they cease to function.

01:18:11.108 --> 01:18:12.108
Yeah.

01:18:13.193 --> 01:18:15.112
Unfortunately, there is no cure.

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:18.699
You could've put some sugar on that shit.

01:18:18.782 --> 01:18:22.828
I'm sorry. Listen, it's very rare
to see in somebody as young as you.

01:18:22.911 --> 01:18:27.958
- Then I got a better chance to beat it.
- Yeah, well, like I said, there's no cure.

01:18:28.542 --> 01:18:29.710
All right, Stuart?

01:18:30.335 --> 01:18:34.214
But the rate of progression,
it varies from person to person.

01:18:34.298 --> 01:18:35.298
How long?

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.467
The first things
to atrophy will be the quadriceps,

01:18:37.551 --> 01:18:39.595
finger flexors, foot dorsiflexors.

01:18:39.678 --> 01:18:41.722
Later on, the facial muscles,

01:18:41.805 --> 01:18:44.725
especially those
that control eye closure, speech,

01:18:44.808 --> 01:18:46.810
and the muscles
that facilitate your swallowing.

01:18:46.894 --> 01:18:49.188
The good news is
you could have as long as a year

01:18:49.271 --> 01:18:52.900
before you'll need any assistance
with basic daily activities.

01:18:54.443 --> 01:18:56.695
Like what? Like taking a shit?

01:18:56.778 --> 01:18:59.823
Patients find that preparing for a future
with some home augmentations

01:18:59.907 --> 01:19:01.158
eases the transition.

01:19:01.241 --> 01:19:02.910
Take this shit out of my dick.

01:19:02.993 --> 01:19:04.244
I'm gonna send for a nurse.

01:19:04.328 --> 01:19:07.581
Can't cure my disease, can't take a tube
out of my dick, what can you do?

01:19:07.664 --> 01:19:11.168
I understand, Stuart, that you are angry.

01:19:13.253 --> 01:19:16.340
Oh, God.
Is there anything it doesn't fuck with?

01:19:17.007 --> 01:19:18.007
Yeah.

01:19:18.634 --> 01:19:19.718
Erectile function.

01:19:20.511 --> 01:19:22.638
Typically one of the last things to go.

01:19:24.264 --> 01:19:26.099
I'm trying to be a priest, pal.

01:19:35.484 --> 01:19:37.444
Let me know if you need anything.

01:19:48.288 --> 01:19:50.791
God is all about defying the odds.

01:19:51.375 --> 01:19:55.838
You know, showing people
what they didn't think was possible is.

01:19:55.921 --> 01:20:00.133
I defied every odd to get where I'm at.
You'd think he'd give a brother a break.

01:20:03.136 --> 01:20:06.014
Maybe this is God giving you your break.

01:20:07.391 --> 01:20:11.728
You know, Hollywood's not
got too many handsome handicapped.

01:20:14.648 --> 01:20:17.734
You think Ali wanna be known
as the best Black boxer?

01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:20.404
Guys like us go for greatest of great.

01:20:28.829 --> 01:20:29.829
Stu...

01:20:31.248 --> 01:20:34.877
Only thing you and Ali got
in common is a wheelchair in your future.

01:20:53.604 --> 01:20:54.730
You all right, bro?

01:20:57.149 --> 01:20:58.984
God don't make mistakes, right?

01:21:10.704 --> 01:21:12.789
You love me, but you don't want me.

01:21:16.752 --> 01:21:18.128
You're testing me, huh?

01:21:19.046 --> 01:21:21.548
You wanna test me to see how serious I am?

01:21:24.426 --> 01:21:25.426
Why?

01:21:28.388 --> 01:21:29.388
Why?

01:21:30.349 --> 01:21:31.350
Why?

01:21:33.685 --> 01:21:34.811
I wanna know why.

01:21:36.688 --> 01:21:38.774
I wanna know why. I wanna know now.

01:21:39.399 --> 01:21:40.399
Why?

01:21:41.485 --> 01:21:44.154
Why have you forsaken me here now?

01:21:51.912 --> 01:21:55.165
And I'm here, and I wanna do right,
and I wanna be good.

01:21:55.874 --> 01:21:59.211
I'm gonna be good.
I'm gonna do right, I'm wanna be good.

01:21:59.795 --> 01:22:00.921
Please, Lord...

01:22:05.551 --> 01:22:07.052
Goddamn.

01:22:07.845 --> 01:22:10.430
No, I didn't mean that.
You know I didn't mean that.

01:22:11.014 --> 01:22:12.014
All right.

01:22:12.808 --> 01:22:15.811
I need to know now. I need to know now.

01:22:15.894 --> 01:22:16.894
Why?

01:22:17.479 --> 01:22:22.109
What the fuck
you got me doing here like this on my...

01:22:22.192 --> 01:22:23.192
On my own?

01:22:23.819 --> 01:22:26.113
Make sure you put Stephen with me.

01:22:49.845 --> 01:22:50.971
I'll be here, Lord.

01:22:52.389 --> 01:22:53.389
For you.

01:22:58.520 --> 01:22:59.520
<i>You all right?</i>

01:23:00.898 --> 01:23:02.733
<i>That's a dumb question.</i>

01:23:03.567 --> 01:23:04.567
I'm sorry.

01:23:06.486 --> 01:23:07.779
I don't know what else to say.

01:23:08.572 --> 01:23:11.325
That's a first. You must be really sick.

01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:14.119
That's what they're saying.
I feel fine so far.

01:23:14.661 --> 01:23:15.871
<i>Baby.</i>

01:23:15.954 --> 01:23:17.789
You can beat this.

01:23:17.873 --> 01:23:20.709
They ain't seen it in a man so young.

01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:23.378
Means they don't know
it's possible to get it gone.

01:23:23.462 --> 01:23:26.423
<i>You gotta think that way.
Can't think nothing else.</i>

01:23:27.424 --> 01:23:28.425
Yeah.

01:23:28.509 --> 01:23:30.010
But in case you don't,

01:23:31.345 --> 01:23:32.888
you ought to move back home.

01:23:32.971 --> 01:23:35.432
<i>Spend what you got left
doing things you enjoy.</i>

01:23:35.516 --> 01:23:37.476
<i>Eat your favorite food, see your friends.</i>

01:23:37.559 --> 01:23:40.020
Hell, you might even box again.

01:23:40.103 --> 01:23:41.103
Ma.

01:23:41.772 --> 01:23:43.106
<i>Sorry, baby.</i>

01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:44.525
I'm just scared.

01:23:44.608 --> 01:23:45.734
<i>Well, look at Mary.</i>

01:23:45.817 --> 01:23:48.779
Watching her son getting whipped
and nailed. She looked good doing it.

01:23:48.862 --> 01:23:51.490
That's a fucking fairytale, Stu.

01:23:51.573 --> 01:23:52.658
And if it ain't?

01:23:52.741 --> 01:23:56.495
<i>This God of yours,
you'vegiven up everything for him.</i>

01:23:56.578 --> 01:23:58.956
And what's he do? He punishes you.

01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:01.792
When God wounds us,
he calls us closer to him.

01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:03.210
You couldn't get any closer.

01:24:03.293 --> 01:24:05.879
You're already
in the goddamn bed with him.

01:24:06.463 --> 01:24:11.093
Couldn't you make some kind of deal?
He lets you stay around, you be his bitch?

01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:13.595
Otherwise, take your business elsewhere.

01:24:13.679 --> 01:24:16.515
I'm not gay, all right?
And God's not a gangster.

01:24:16.598 --> 01:24:19.476
He don't make deals,
he don't respond to ultimatums.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.603
<i>You can't talk me out of this one.</i>

01:24:27.943 --> 01:24:30.654
<i>I don't know
why I come out here every show</i>

01:24:30.737 --> 01:24:33.824
<i>and I keep saying,
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."</i>

01:24:33.907 --> 01:24:36.326
<i>I don't know what I'm thanking you for.</i>

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:38.078
<i>You get in here for nothing.</i>

01:24:39.079 --> 01:24:41.999
<i>Bill's doing more important shit
right now. Leave word.</i>

01:24:42.082 --> 01:24:44.251
<i>And believe me, that wasn't my idea.</i>

01:24:45.252 --> 01:24:46.879
<i>Bill, it's me, Kathleen.</i>

01:24:47.629 --> 01:24:49.840
<i>I need to talk to you about Stu.</i>

01:24:49.923 --> 01:24:52.885
<i>It's amazing,
the things they have nowadays.</i>

01:24:52.968 --> 01:24:55.762
- <i>Shaving cream with diacetin in it.
</i>- What about him?

01:24:57.181 --> 01:24:59.516
<i>Shaving cream with lanolin in it.</i>

01:25:00.058 --> 01:25:02.269
<i>Shaving cream with chlorophyll in it.</i>

01:25:03.604 --> 01:25:04.438
What's that mean?

01:25:04.521 --> 01:25:08.150
<i>Had to chase all over town
to find shaving cream with soap in it.</i>

01:25:11.778 --> 01:25:13.697
<i>There. A small shave...</i>

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:17.576
Does he need a...?
Can he even get on the crapper by himself?

01:25:17.659 --> 01:25:19.828
<i>Nothing like a nice smooth...</i>

01:25:22.873 --> 01:25:24.666
<i>I forgot to put a blade in it.</i>

01:25:28.962 --> 01:25:32.466
A load of good you and me did,
climbing into bed together.

01:25:32.549 --> 01:25:34.843
Made two kids, own bodies don't want them.

01:25:35.385 --> 01:25:36.385
<i>Hello.</i>

01:26:05.207 --> 01:26:06.208
Hang on.

01:26:08.836 --> 01:26:09.837
Hold your horses.

01:26:17.553 --> 01:26:19.388
You're gonna wake the whole neighborhood.

01:26:19.471 --> 01:26:22.015
This ain't no neighborhood.
This is a trailer park.

01:26:22.099 --> 01:26:23.934
They ought to thank me
for the wake-up call.

01:26:24.017 --> 01:26:25.853
Get their asses up to find a job.

01:26:25.936 --> 01:26:27.688
Early bird gets the worm. You heard?

01:26:27.771 --> 01:26:30.941
- Some of them got jobs. Get in here.
- Thought you'd never ask.

01:26:36.446 --> 01:26:37.489
This is nice.

01:26:38.156 --> 01:26:40.284
You make Mama look like Martha Stew.

01:26:42.661 --> 01:26:46.498
Yeah, I was thinking of hiring
your girlfriend to tidy up for me.

01:26:46.582 --> 01:26:48.750
She'd appreciate the work, probably.

01:26:48.834 --> 01:26:51.044
Seeing as the church mouse
feeds on strangers' scraps

01:26:51.128 --> 01:26:54.673
and people these days
are just stingy assholes.

01:26:56.216 --> 01:26:58.343
You get back what you put out there.

01:27:00.596 --> 01:27:03.265
Is that why
God gave you an incurable disease?

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:06.185
You called it.

01:27:06.852 --> 01:27:08.937
You always said I was a degenerate.

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:13.150
Drop in unannounced.

01:27:13.233 --> 01:27:16.862
Don't give a man time
to take a piss or get his shit together.

01:27:16.945 --> 01:27:18.614
I beg your pardon, Padre.

01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:56.610
You casing the joint,
gonna steal more of my shit?

01:27:59.696 --> 01:28:01.490
I come to see you ain't killed yourself.

01:28:01.573 --> 01:28:03.033
Left Mama high and dry.

01:28:04.034 --> 01:28:06.537
You think you're the only one
that can keep a vow?

01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:08.247
Don't get all high and mighty with me.

01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:10.541
I'm still your fucking father.
Don't you forget that.

01:28:12.668 --> 01:28:15.170
It's lucky
you ain't bet one dime on me, huh?

01:28:22.344 --> 01:28:23.637
I'm praying for you.

01:28:24.471 --> 01:28:25.681
Don't you dare.

01:28:26.974 --> 01:28:29.560
You're violating my rights as a man.

01:28:30.352 --> 01:28:31.520
As an American.

01:28:59.006 --> 01:29:03.260
<i>Look not on our sins,
but on the faith of your Church.</i>

01:29:04.303 --> 01:29:09.558
<i>And graciously Grant her peace
andunity in accordance with your will.</i>

01:29:10.267 --> 01:29:14.271
<i>Who live and reign forever and ever.</i>

01:29:14.354 --> 01:29:16.648
<i>- Amen.
- Amen.</i>

01:29:17.191 --> 01:29:20.360
<i>The peace of the Lord be with you always.</i>

01:29:20.444 --> 01:29:23.113
And now let us offer each other

01:29:23.197 --> 01:29:25.407
a sign of peace.

01:29:26.366 --> 01:29:27.743
Peace be with you.

01:29:28.785 --> 01:29:29.870
Peace be with you.

01:29:34.166 --> 01:29:35.501
Peace be with you.

01:29:42.758 --> 01:29:44.176
<i>When were you gonna tell me?</i>

01:29:45.802 --> 01:29:47.471
When I prayed away my pride.

01:29:53.477 --> 01:29:55.312
I'll marry you, you want me to.

01:29:59.274 --> 01:30:01.109
Aren't you gonna ask
what kind of guy he is?

01:30:01.193 --> 01:30:02.193
No.

01:30:02.236 --> 01:30:03.403
I'd beat him up.

01:30:03.946 --> 01:30:05.739
But I'm trying to be a priest.

01:30:12.913 --> 01:30:13.913
Well, for...

01:30:16.583 --> 01:30:19.002
For what it's worth, you have my support.

01:30:21.046 --> 01:30:22.589
In sickness and in health?

01:30:23.173 --> 01:30:24.591
In case I get a miracle?

01:30:25.759 --> 01:30:27.261
Until death do we part?

01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:39.731
If your mom asks,

01:30:40.732 --> 01:30:43.443
tell her I came
to convince you to abandon priesthood.

01:30:43.527 --> 01:30:45.237
She ain't gonna believe that.

01:30:46.071 --> 01:30:47.239
Not you.

01:30:51.994 --> 01:30:52.994
It's okay.

01:31:50.469 --> 01:31:51.678
Give me a hand here.

01:32:02.731 --> 01:32:05.567
It's our mission
to enter the darkest places,

01:32:05.651 --> 01:32:07.778
and to be the light of Christ.

01:32:07.861 --> 01:32:09.112
"Dark"?

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:12.407
Because we Black, bad, or both?

01:32:15.285 --> 01:32:16.285
It...

01:32:16.662 --> 01:32:18.830
It's a metaphor.

01:32:18.914 --> 01:32:24.211
If you gonna use big words like that,
might as well pass out dictionaries, bro.

01:32:27.881 --> 01:32:30.384
You guys get
one phone call a week in here?

01:32:32.970 --> 01:32:34.680
If you kiss the right ass.

01:32:36.098 --> 01:32:37.516
Who you gonna call, huh?

01:32:38.267 --> 01:32:39.267
Your mama?

01:32:40.727 --> 01:32:42.604
You gonna break her heart some more.

01:32:43.564 --> 01:32:44.564
Your wife?

01:32:45.482 --> 01:32:48.652
Shit, let's be real,
she probably busy banging her new man.

01:32:51.029 --> 01:32:52.029
And your kid?

01:32:52.656 --> 01:32:55.909
He'd probably get more pity
in school if his daddy was dead.

01:32:57.619 --> 01:32:59.705
Don't need no phone to talk to God.

01:33:00.539 --> 01:33:02.708
Don't need a guard's permission, neither.

01:33:02.791 --> 01:33:06.837
When no one else gives a shit
what you got to say, God does.

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.589
Because he made your ass.

01:33:09.756 --> 01:33:13.886
You damn right he's disappointed in it,
but he wants to help.

01:33:16.638 --> 01:33:20.726
No matter how hard you resist it,
no matter how many times you say no.

01:33:21.268 --> 01:33:23.270
He still wants to make you better.

01:33:26.523 --> 01:33:28.358
He ain't giving up on you.

01:33:29.484 --> 01:33:30.484
Never.

01:33:31.028 --> 01:33:33.572
Don't you dare go giving up on yourself.

01:33:40.037 --> 01:33:41.246
You wanna try again?

01:33:52.299 --> 01:33:54.468
Have a seat, Stuart.

01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:55.552
You know what?

01:33:57.179 --> 01:33:59.681
I'm trying to stay fit. I'll have a stand.

01:34:05.062 --> 01:34:07.731
There is concern amongst the diocese

01:34:07.814 --> 01:34:10.776
that the state of your infirmity

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:16.657
will render you unable
to properly perform the sacraments.

01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:24.122
It may even cause you to disgrace them.

01:34:24.206 --> 01:34:28.627
I spill the blood. Choke on the body.
Fall on my face trying to genuflect.

01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:30.838
You think I haven't thought of that?

01:34:31.922 --> 01:34:34.258
We're not human beings
having a spiritual experience,

01:34:34.341 --> 01:34:36.426
we are spiritual beings
having a human one.

01:34:36.969 --> 01:34:39.972
This body don't mean nothing to God.
Therefore nor should it to you.

01:34:45.769 --> 01:34:48.397
Unfortunately, it's not up to me.

01:34:49.356 --> 01:34:52.693
The Church will
not endorse you for ordination.

01:35:02.452 --> 01:35:06.373
At first the Church couldn't afford
to subsidize me as a face of Catholicism.

01:35:07.249 --> 01:35:09.293
Now it can't afford
to subsidize a cripple.

01:35:10.085 --> 01:35:13.630
This time it ain't a matter of reputation,
it's a matter of the money.

01:35:13.714 --> 01:35:14.715
Isn't that right?

01:35:16.675 --> 01:35:19.428
God don't move the goalpost, Father.
Man does.

01:35:22.639 --> 01:35:28.020
It is my duty
to defend the sanctity of our Church.

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:32.024
I'm sorry, Stuart.

01:37:02.948 --> 01:37:04.449
<i>Hello, Mr. Long.</i>

01:37:05.993 --> 01:37:07.578
<i>I'm sorry, my name is Ham.</i>

01:37:08.328 --> 01:37:10.497
<i>I'm a friend of your son, Stuart.</i>

01:37:33.604 --> 01:37:35.147
Nearly done there or what?

01:37:40.277 --> 01:37:41.653
She gonna help me up.

01:37:44.156 --> 01:37:45.282
Oh, come on now.

01:37:45.365 --> 01:37:47.451
This ain't the hill to die on.

01:37:48.619 --> 01:37:49.870
It's the only one.

01:38:05.344 --> 01:38:06.637
It's a solid build.

01:38:19.274 --> 01:38:21.401
I seen insects grope about for death

01:38:21.485 --> 01:38:23.820
with more dignity
than what you're displaying right now.

01:38:23.904 --> 01:38:24.905
You here to help?

01:38:26.448 --> 01:38:27.866
Play a hymn on the harp.

01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:30.619
Makes pathetic shit look poetic.

01:38:32.538 --> 01:38:34.456
The only hymn I know is Haggard.

01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:36.291
Ain't you got somewhere to be?

01:38:36.375 --> 01:38:37.375
Yeah, probably.

01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:44.424
I'm trying out this new thing
they got now called self-employment.

01:38:44.508 --> 01:38:46.134
All the kids are doing it.

01:38:46.802 --> 01:38:48.178
I heard about that.

01:38:48.804 --> 01:38:51.098
Identical twin sister to unemployment.

01:38:52.349 --> 01:38:54.852
Except they swear
she's the better-looking one.

01:39:04.403 --> 01:39:07.281
I seen a couple of boxing bouts on the TV.

01:39:07.364 --> 01:39:10.742
Enough to know a man
don't lose when he gets knocked down,

01:39:12.327 --> 01:39:13.829
but when he won't get up.

01:39:16.665 --> 01:39:18.834
If there's one thing
I know about you, it's...

01:39:19.459 --> 01:39:21.128
you ain't afraid to get hit.

01:39:31.847 --> 01:39:33.515
You gonna watch or what?

01:39:33.599 --> 01:39:34.850
Yeah.

01:40:27.611 --> 01:40:29.988
- Hey, Mama.
- Hi, baby.

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:41.040
What you waiting on?

01:40:41.708 --> 01:40:42.960
Well, you.

01:40:53.136 --> 01:40:54.555
What you doing in there?

01:40:59.643 --> 01:41:01.520
Praying for you to get some Patience.

01:41:01.603 --> 01:41:04.022
You ought to try praying for my prostate.

01:41:32.926 --> 01:41:33.926
You all right?

01:41:34.303 --> 01:41:36.597
I ain't trying to close my curtains
in the shit box,

01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.931
if that's what you're asking.

01:41:39.099 --> 01:41:41.518
Well, you always did wanna be like Elvis.

01:41:41.602 --> 01:41:43.270
I didn't think you noticed.

01:41:44.188 --> 01:41:46.273
How could I not? You never shut up.

01:41:46.356 --> 01:41:48.442
Many hours of silence, gone.

01:41:48.525 --> 01:41:51.028
They say it's gold. We could've been rich.

01:41:52.279 --> 01:41:54.907
Too late now.
Ain't gonna get that time back.

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.200
Yeah.

01:41:57.618 --> 01:41:58.952
How do we tackle this?

01:41:59.912 --> 01:42:01.580
Come on. Yeah.

01:42:23.268 --> 01:42:24.478
We're gonna be late.

01:42:29.358 --> 01:42:32.069
- The news ain't said hell froze over.
- That the best you got?

01:42:32.152 --> 01:42:34.988
I'd clap if I could. I might slap myself.

01:42:35.072 --> 01:42:36.323
That's more like it.

01:42:37.574 --> 01:42:39.868
I never did like wearing these things.

01:42:39.952 --> 01:42:42.371
Ain't done one of these
since your brother's funeral.

01:42:42.454 --> 01:42:44.164
Still got your mother's makeup on it.

01:42:44.248 --> 01:42:45.874
You got another one coming up.

01:42:45.958 --> 01:42:47.417
Shut the fuck up with that.

01:42:47.501 --> 01:42:49.586
Meantime, take Mama somewhere nice.

01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:04.226
Can't say I never gave you nothing.

01:43:05.394 --> 01:43:09.064
I skipped over thanking you.
Went straight to the source.

01:43:10.482 --> 01:43:12.317
This thing purrs like a kitten.

01:43:16.238 --> 01:43:17.364
Oh, no.

01:43:19.241 --> 01:43:20.284
You son of a...

01:43:20.367 --> 01:43:24.955
Son of a bitch. You piece of shit.
You couldn't wait till tomorrow.

01:43:25.038 --> 01:43:27.499
Maybe that's God saying
you ought to share your shit.

01:43:27.583 --> 01:43:30.294
- Or else.
- Yeah, well, she's all yours now.

01:43:30.377 --> 01:43:32.254
We ain't that far. I could walk.

01:43:32.337 --> 01:43:34.006
Yeah, and I can fucking fly.

01:43:35.257 --> 01:43:38.260
- Where you going?
- I gotta get your ass to church on time.

01:43:56.445 --> 01:43:57.445
There you go.

01:44:08.916 --> 01:44:10.417
Breathing heavy already.

01:44:10.501 --> 01:44:13.420
- It's the bad air.
- You gonna have a heart attack.

01:44:13.504 --> 01:44:16.965
Well, then it'll all be right.
I'd die before you.

01:44:17.049 --> 01:44:18.675
Yeah, you ain't that lucky.

01:44:18.759 --> 01:44:19.759
Shut up.

01:44:29.269 --> 01:44:30.896
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, Mama.

01:44:34.858 --> 01:44:37.945
- Wanna tell me what's going on here?
- What you mean?

01:44:38.570 --> 01:44:40.113
Dad is in a tie.

01:44:40.197 --> 01:44:41.782
He looks nice.

01:44:49.581 --> 01:44:52.167
Y'all think since I can't be a priest,
I'm gonna marry her?

01:44:53.418 --> 01:44:56.463
- Y'all bless this?
- You're in no state to protest.

01:44:56.547 --> 01:44:59.341
- You called her a housekeeper.
- What's wrong with housekeepers?

01:44:59.883 --> 01:45:02.344
That's good for her.
In three months, I'll be in a diaper.

01:45:02.427 --> 01:45:04.471
You're gonna need someone
to clean up your shit.

01:45:04.555 --> 01:45:06.348
- That's your job.
- I'm gonna subcontract.

01:45:06.431 --> 01:45:09.351
Oh, cut that shit out, you two.

01:45:09.434 --> 01:45:10.978
Here. Let's go.

01:45:11.061 --> 01:45:12.771
- Mind your back, Bill.
- Okay.

01:45:29.997 --> 01:45:32.958
Our parish petitioned the diocese
to ordain you as a priest.

01:45:33.792 --> 01:45:35.752
Monsignor made sure it was heard.

01:45:36.795 --> 01:45:40.007
Turns out,
I had one good fight left in me.

01:45:45.971 --> 01:45:47.806
We all believe in you, brother.

01:45:50.225 --> 01:45:51.685
That's Father to you.

01:47:16.895 --> 01:47:19.398
Someone once told me
I was bad advertising.

01:47:20.274 --> 01:47:21.316
Imagine that.

01:47:23.151 --> 01:47:25.237
He was a boss of mine at the supermarket.

01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:28.949
I kept coming in with a face looked more
like raw meat than what I was selling.

01:47:30.701 --> 01:47:32.035
Of course at the time,

01:47:33.036 --> 01:47:34.746
I thought that man was wrong.

01:47:36.248 --> 01:47:38.292
Whole world was wrong when it came to me.

01:47:39.751 --> 01:47:43.338
Every brawl I had was beating back
at a world I thought had done me wrong.

01:47:46.341 --> 01:47:47.341
Yeah.

01:47:48.635 --> 01:47:50.137
Every bruise on my face,

01:47:51.513 --> 01:47:55.392
every drop of blood I shed was proof
of my war against God's injustice.

01:47:58.103 --> 01:48:01.273
I look worse now
than I did then, that's for sure.

01:48:01.356 --> 01:48:02.357
Difference is...

01:48:04.484 --> 01:48:06.987
now I know my suffering's a gift from God.

01:48:09.072 --> 01:48:11.033
Now, I know it sounds like bull,

01:48:11.116 --> 01:48:13.202
but it's coming
from a man in a wheelchair,

01:48:13.285 --> 01:48:14.953
so you got to entertain it.

01:48:17.122 --> 01:48:18.122
Hear me out.

01:48:23.712 --> 01:48:25.923
All our outer nature's wasting away.

01:48:27.633 --> 01:48:30.469
But our inner nature
is being renewed every day.

01:48:32.012 --> 01:48:35.933
This life, no matter how long it lasts,

01:48:36.016 --> 01:48:40.145
is a momentary affliction
preparing us for eternal glory.

01:48:42.314 --> 01:48:44.399
We shouldn't pray for an easy life,

01:48:45.275 --> 01:48:47.778
but the strength
to endure a difficult one.

01:48:48.737 --> 01:48:50.822
Because the experience of suffering

01:48:51.448 --> 01:48:53.825
is the fullest expression of God's love.

01:48:55.244 --> 01:48:57.496
It is a chance to be closer to Christ.

01:49:05.087 --> 01:49:07.005
Now, no one suffers perfectly.

01:49:07.089 --> 01:49:08.257
For sure not me.

01:49:09.591 --> 01:49:11.844
Even Christ had his moment of despair.

01:49:13.595 --> 01:49:16.098
"My God, my God,
why have you forsaken me?"

01:49:17.766 --> 01:49:19.268
He asked from the cross.

01:49:20.143 --> 01:49:21.395
Christ felt betrayed.

01:49:23.313 --> 01:49:24.731
You see, in that moment,

01:49:25.774 --> 01:49:27.109
he who was sinless...

01:49:27.985 --> 01:49:30.863
took on all our sins,
and got judged by God.

01:49:32.865 --> 01:49:36.076
He took what we deserve,
because he loves us.

01:49:45.961 --> 01:49:46.961
And that love...

01:49:48.839 --> 01:49:51.258
it could make the baddest man a believer.

01:49:52.801 --> 01:49:56.180
Because that love
is a feeling like no other.

01:49:59.349 --> 01:50:01.977
To lead you all
to find and feel that love...

01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:07.774
is why God is giving me
the scenic route to die.

01:50:10.485 --> 01:50:12.613
And for that, I thank him every day.

01:50:16.575 --> 01:50:17.743
Amen.

01:50:17.826 --> 01:50:18.869
Amen.

01:51:05.332 --> 01:51:06.750
- Hi.
- How you doing?

01:51:06.834 --> 01:51:07.834
Great.

01:51:19.096 --> 01:51:22.015
- And who are you here to visit, sir?
- Father Stu.

01:51:22.099 --> 01:51:24.309
You and everybody else in this town.

01:51:34.278 --> 01:51:35.654
Good morning.

01:51:35.737 --> 01:51:37.865
Good one to be in sin, I suppose.

01:51:44.496 --> 01:51:46.164
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

01:51:46.248 --> 01:51:49.042
It has been seven days
since my last confession.

01:51:50.377 --> 01:51:51.670
But no matter how many I make,

01:51:51.753 --> 01:51:55.007
these hands that touch the troubled
are still themselves unclean.

01:51:58.802 --> 01:51:59.970
You having doubts?

01:52:05.142 --> 01:52:08.562
A doubt would imply that
I ever wanted this responsibility.

01:52:10.647 --> 01:52:11.815
My father did.

01:52:14.026 --> 01:52:15.402
It was expected of me.

01:52:24.703 --> 01:52:26.788
I'm angry at God.

01:52:29.249 --> 01:52:33.045
For failing to make me man enough
to defy the expectations of me.

01:52:35.005 --> 01:52:38.509
And I'm envious of you
for having the balls to do just that.

01:52:39.551 --> 01:52:43.514
All I ever prayed for
was a way out of this life.

01:52:46.141 --> 01:52:48.727
And to watch you given an out by God,

01:52:49.686 --> 01:52:50.771
and refuse it...

01:52:52.856 --> 01:52:54.483
I can't understand it.

01:52:58.028 --> 01:52:59.279
But I do admire it.

01:53:01.448 --> 01:53:03.700
For these and all my sins, I am sorry.

01:53:07.037 --> 01:53:10.123
I wasn't given no expectation,
except to stay alive.

01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:13.418
I ain't coming too good on that.

01:53:15.712 --> 01:53:20.133
Whether by offering his son,
or for watching one die,

01:53:21.301 --> 01:53:23.262
a father's just looking for love,

01:53:24.388 --> 01:53:25.597
like the rest of us.

01:53:51.248 --> 01:53:53.709
Imagine how it must've felt for Joseph...

01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:57.379
to be the less important father.

01:53:59.715 --> 01:54:01.717
In his name, you pray for penance.

01:54:21.028 --> 01:54:22.028
Goodbye, Stu.

01:54:31.747 --> 01:54:33.498
Bill Long, alcoholic.

01:54:33.582 --> 01:54:34.750
Hi, Bill.

01:54:37.794 --> 01:54:40.214
I feel like
I'm putting my dick in a woodchipper.

01:54:40.297 --> 01:54:43.800
We've all been in your shoes.
Sometimes, too drunk to put them on.

01:54:43.884 --> 01:54:46.929
You've made the first step,
admitting you can't do it alone.

01:54:47.012 --> 01:54:48.013
Amen.

01:54:49.056 --> 01:54:52.935
Yeah, well, I could've used
God's help for a lot of things,

01:54:53.018 --> 01:54:55.229
but never could find him.

01:54:56.772 --> 01:54:59.733
My son said,
that's because God wasn't lost.

01:55:01.693 --> 01:55:02.694
Wise-ass.

01:55:05.864 --> 01:55:08.534
Anyway, I sure as hell
ain't got the road map.

01:55:09.868 --> 01:55:13.914
I'm here because
my son asked me to get baptized.

01:55:19.127 --> 01:55:21.505
I killed every hero that boy ever had,

01:55:22.297 --> 01:55:24.508
hoping one day that hero would be me.

01:55:27.553 --> 01:55:30.180
Never gave him a single reason
why it should be.

01:56:09.011 --> 01:56:10.971
I guess we're both late bloomers.

01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:42.688
<i>It's a profound experience,</i>

01:57:43.272 --> 01:57:44.272
<i>suffering.</i>

01:57:45.190 --> 01:57:49.236
<i>And the struggles of this disease</i>

01:57:50.028 --> 01:57:52.281
<i>help me, and help others,</i>

01:57:52.364 --> 01:57:55.993
<i>to learn the way that
we should have been living all along.</i>

01:57:57.703 --> 01:57:59.746
<i>It's taught me a little humility.</i>

01:57:59.830 --> 01:58:02.666
<i>It's taughtme dignity,
respect for others.</i>

01:58:03.250 --> 01:58:06.378
Sometimes people like me...
There's an extreme example.

01:58:07.629 --> 01:58:11.508
We need things like this
to be able to make those changes,

01:58:11.592 --> 01:58:15.179
and decisions in our life that
are gonna help us become better people.

01:58:15.262 --> 01:58:19.266
Become the people that God has created us
to be when he sent us to this planet.

02:01:20.322 --> 02:01:23.867
It's all about deception.
Make them think you're going right.

02:01:23.951 --> 02:01:26.036
Then pow, hit them with that left.

02:01:26.119 --> 02:01:28.997
Unpredictability.
It makes the audience the actor's bitch.

02:01:29.081 --> 02:01:32.167
The director says
we're supposed to disappear.

02:01:32.251 --> 02:01:34.586
No, honey,
that's why they call it stealing the show.

02:01:34.670 --> 02:01:36.630
Nobody gives you permission to entertain.

02:01:36.713 --> 02:01:38.590
- I'm 7.
- I'm trying to help you, kid.

02:01:38.674 --> 02:01:41.009
Impart some wisdom.
God smiles on that shit.

02:01:41.093 --> 02:01:42.094
Quiet all around.

02:01:43.011 --> 02:01:45.389
I know what you're thinking.
You're free to fuck this up.

02:01:45.472 --> 02:01:47.266
Worst that happens,
you don't make the cut.

02:01:47.349 --> 02:01:50.060
In the ring, you get one chance.
You better make it count.

02:01:50.143 --> 02:01:52.771
That's the difference
between movies and real life.

02:01:52.855 --> 02:01:54.815
Your choice how you wanna live.

02:01:55.482 --> 02:01:56.482
Rolling.

02:01:58.485 --> 02:01:59.486
A Mark.

02:02:00.737 --> 02:02:02.739
Wanna be a big star? Follow me.

02:02:02.823 --> 02:02:04.992
Background. And action.

02:02:05.075 --> 02:02:06.368
Hey, you.

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:09.121
Maid.

02:02:17.004 --> 02:02:18.547
Cut, cut. Oh, my...

02:02:18.630 --> 02:02:20.340
Cut. Are you crazy?

02:02:20.424 --> 02:02:22.718
- I'm making it real. That was good.
- You're background.

02:02:22.801 --> 02:02:24.845
Trying to help.
These guys ain't doing it right.

02:02:25.429 --> 02:02:27.973
- Get him.
- Hey, don't talk to the king like that.

02:02:28.056 --> 02:02:29.933
- What's wrong with you?
- You're wrapped.

02:02:30.017 --> 02:02:31.518
- What?
- Congratulations.
