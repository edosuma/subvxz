00:01.000 --> 00:05.000
-This is a good spot.
-Give me the sickle.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
-The moon isn't full.
-Yes, it is.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
-Oh, you've got this
-It's full.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
-Wait. Wait.
-Freezing.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Hm. Waiting.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
And begin.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
In the beginning,
there were the brothers,

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
the first and the second man.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
The prophecy of Veran is the most
important in the history of this land.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
There is one child sent by the Gods,

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
and she will lead us into the light!

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
I need to find the girl
before he does.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
-Veran.
-You have betrayed me.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
-Why have you lied to us?
-Go!

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Veran's finished.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
If it's not Veran, then who?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Do you know what a messiah is?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Harka is risen!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I serve the dead man!

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Some are just mad-men or women,

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
but some are dangerous,
very dangerous.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
-Eat.
-I await the great vision.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I await the great vision!

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Listen very carefully.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
If you really want
to destroy something,

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
you don't use a sword, you use love.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
The fisherman who lives
at the mouth of the river

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
has three sons.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Bring them to me.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Dad.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Hi there.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
-Morning.
-Hello.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
This is a fine, quiet place
you have here.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
One...

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Two...

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Three.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
We should talk.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
When I look out my window

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Many sights to see

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
And when I look in my window

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
So many different people to be

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Oh, no

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Must be the season of the witch

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
Must be the season
of the witch, yeah

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
Must be the season of the witch

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
You got to pick up every stitch

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
The rabbits runnin' in the ditch

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
Beatniks are out to make it rich

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
-This man she was with...
-The beggar.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I mean, he looked like a beggar.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I need you to tell me
everything you saw.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Everything you heard.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
I've faced down armies.
Been captured, tortured.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
-Never once been afraid.
-And are you afraid now, Praefectus?

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
-Are you afraid?
-I fear nothing, General.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
-But...
-But what?

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
The attack on the Oppida...

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
-If we'd been here rather than...
-Rather than what, Praefectus?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
Your predecessor, Lucius...

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
There was no better man who fought
with me in the field.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
And suddenly...

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
It can happen to the best of us.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
What I mean is,
are you still with me?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
I need you to help me pursue
my purpose.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Our true purpose.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
I will follow you into hell itself.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
-Where's the general?
-Ooh. Who are you?

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
-The general's resting.
-Wake him up.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
The fuck do you think you are?

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
What if we told you to turn round,
get on your horse and fuck off?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Or you could give us both a polish.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
We just got paid.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
-Oh! No, don't...
-What's going on?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
-What do you want?
-The general.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Excuse the mess.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Bother with the locals.
Quite took us by surprise.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
Talking of surprises, let me guess.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
You were just passing,
thought you'd drop in.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
"Aulus, mate. What was I thinking?
Here's your money back?"

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
When you were riding over here,
did you not think to yourself,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
"What if he's still upset
about what I did.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
What if he's still so miffed
he turns me inside out

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
and feeds me to his dogs?"

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
I've got something for you.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
Is it the young daughter
of a blind fucking father?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I don't have all day.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Well, the suspense is killing me.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
It's a mile from here,
buried in the ground.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Well, I must say, I'm intrigued.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
So who sent you? Whose errand girl
are you? You can tell me.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
-It's a straight yes or no.
-How much?

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
-My weight in silver.
-Cheeky bitch.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
Twice my weight.
Unless you're doing just fine here.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Unless you don't need
what I'm selling.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
I love it! Love it!

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
I'll tell you what.
Let's do this. Let's play!

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
Vitus, open the Silver House.
We're going to market.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
I said I was sorry.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
And I've passed on
your apologies to the Gods.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
And the Gods said,
"Divis, we're sorry, too,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
for picking such a stupid little twerp.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
What the fuck were we thinking?
We must have been drunk."

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Where are we headed?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
-A gorge. Three days walk from here.
-Is it safe?

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
The last place was safe.
Until you blew everything.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
-Me?
-21 moons.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Herbs, leaves, grasses, mosses,
ground and dried to make powders,

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
potions, unguents
to cast the deepest spells.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
-We've still got Big Pebble.
-You make me sick.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
I'm looking on the bright side.
There is no bright side!

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
-Now nowhere is safe!
-Why not?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Because of the Deep Dream!

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
-The what?
-Last night I had the Deep Dream.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
What's the Deep Dream?

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
You can't know because
you're not at that stage of your study.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
You could be. You should be.
But you're not.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
So why bring it up?
Unless it's just to be a cock about it.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
Because in the Deep Dream,
something happened,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
something terrible.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
What happened?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
I saw the Vast Green River.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
And?

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
The Vast Green River was rolling West
under the high oaks.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
-And suddenly...
-Suddenly what?

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
The river divided. It split into two.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
So?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
This is...
This is like dealing with a...

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
The Vast Green River
has no tributaries!

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
The Vast Green River
is the Vast Green River!

11:01.000 --> 11:07.000
I see. And yet, to be fair,
as you pointed out yourself,

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
I don't know the first fucking
thing about the Vast Green River!

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
When I was a novice, I treated
my Druid master with respect.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I worshiped him.
I called him my pilot.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
My pilot smells extra special
this morning.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
-So what does it mean if the big...
-The Vast!

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
If the Vast Green River splits in two?

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
It means the Druids
have been split asunder.

11:41.000 --> 11:46.000
Veran has lost control. And our dead
are at war with one another.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Really? What's this?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
What are you doing?

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
All of those soldiers looking for me...
It suddenly...

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Suddenly what?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
I'm alone.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
You're not alone.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
Why me?

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
-And that's it.
-Twice.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Well, a deal's a deal.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
Along the river a mile or so, there's
a stick in the middle of six stones.

12:56.000 --> 13:01.000
What if I just say that
I required your services?

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
-Light a big fire.
-A fire?

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
The hill after the flatlands,
light it up. Wait.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.000
By the way,
The Dead Man says, 'Hello.'

13:31.000 --> 13:36.000
Well, well... This is my lucky day!

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
So it is begun.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
Now there's an old face. Come.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
I come not to join you...
But to warn you.

14:08.000 --> 14:13.000
-To warn me?
-Your heart once knew light.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
It is to that heart I would speak.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Stop this black game
before it is too late.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
This black game. Is it not our game?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
The one we've been
playing all along?

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Do you remember when we first met?

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
I was only a child.
You came and found me, didn't you?

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
I was sitting in sunlight,
and I looked up and there you were.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
You gave me an apple.
Do you remember?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
This final time I implore you.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
Rejoin the dead
where your soul belongs.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
No!

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
I have something for you.
A message, a message for Veran.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
Will you take it to him?
Will you be the wind?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Boo.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
There's a man here.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
His job is to get answers.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
He can make a moment
feel like a lifetime...

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
..a minute like a thousand years.

15:49.000 --> 15:56.000
But in the end...
He always gets the answers.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
So tell me, where's the girl?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
This is your last chance.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
I will see you on the other side.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Who's there?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Any luck?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Slowly, slowly, catchy monkey.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
So here's what's going to happen.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Let me speak to her.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
I know witchcraft.
My ancestors were witches.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
After all I summoned you, didn't I?

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
Well, that depends on
where you're standing.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Did you summon me, or I you?

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
-That depends.
-On what?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
On whether you believe in destiny.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Well, now, there's a subject.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
She doesn't frighten me.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
Let me go to her. I'll make her talk.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
You're too precious to me.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Besides, I'm saving you
for something else.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Another task far more important.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
My destiny?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
We'll see.

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
This is an extraordinary
honor for your family.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
Your sons have got a great destiny
ahead of them. They've been chosen.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
We're sea folk. How can this be?

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
If the Gods choose us,
everything is possible. Trust me.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
What I mean is it's not for us
to question their ways.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
You know, I've been learning that.
And it's not been easy.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
Who will help when the lambs come?
We've mouths to feed here.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
This is a fortune.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
The Gods will provide.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
Do you even know your heart?
Have you seen it?

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
I'd know your heart,
if I could hold it in my hand...

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
This little piggy went to the market.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
This little piggy stayed at home.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Thirsty?

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
This is yours.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
This is part of you.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
Like my fingers.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
My fingers.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
My lovely fingers.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
My baby fingers...

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
..holding my mother...

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Touching her face.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
I had ten lovely fingers.

21:47.000 --> 21:50.000
And now I only have these.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
My fingers...

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
Holding...

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
You.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
Holding your soul.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
This is your soul...

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Twisting in my fingers.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
This is your soul.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Can you see it?

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
-Yes.
-Good.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
Now listen very, very carefully.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Here's what I want you to do.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
What's wrong with him?

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Where's he going?

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
When I look out my window

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Many sights to see

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
And when I look in my window

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Get him out!

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
So many different people to be

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
That it's strange

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
So strange

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
Must be the season of the witch

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
Must be the season of the witch

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
This little piggy went to market.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Have you ever met the Druids?

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
It's a long journey.
You'll have to talk at some point.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
None of us want to be here.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
We want to go home.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
Before I came,
what did you think you'd be in life?

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Fisherman.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
When I was your age,
I thought I'd be a king.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Aim low, mate.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
My father was king of a great tribe.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
King Pellenor of the Cantii.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
What happened?

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
My true fate.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
Take my example. Before I wed,
there was a week of feasts.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
Thousands of people came
just to be there.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
What was her name?

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
Amena. Amena of the Devni.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
I was 20. I was stood there,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
waiting at the Handfasting stone.

25:26.000 --> 25:31.000
Must have been 500 warriors and elders.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
I watched her come close.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
So beautiful I couldn't breathe.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
I took her hand.
I looked into her eyes...

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
..and I knew we were doomed.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
But you did it.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
-Why?
-Why? That is the question.

25:56.000 --> 25:59.000
That is the only question. Why?

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
Because if it hadn't happened,
like everything else in my life,

26:06.000 --> 26:11.000
I wouldn't be here now
doing this great work for the Gods.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
It's not about what you want.

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
It's about knowing there's a plan.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
We're servants, not masters.

26:20.000 --> 26:25.000
There'll come a time you'll understand.
Trust me.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
I can't get the image out of my head.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
-He went up like a torch.
-Stop talking about it.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
-Move it.
-Ay up. What's this?

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
So you have powers, strong powers.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Why don't you use them on me?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
To do that, I'd need something of yours.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
Anything you want, just ask.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Give me your finger.

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
My finger?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
-Just one?
-One is all I need.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
Any particular one?

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
-That one.
-What? The little one?

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Little piggy...

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
There now. How's that?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
It's all yours.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
What're you waiting for? Pick it up.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.000
Pick up the finger.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
I wasn't sure before.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
Now I see it.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Where's The Girl?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
So this is it. This is the cave.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
-Hey. I liked the last place.
-I didn't say anything.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
What you said earlier...

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
The truth is you are alone.
That's your fate.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
I can help you with some things,
but I can't help you with that.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
No one can.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Make a fire.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
Anderus, the ladies say

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
You really shouldn't act that way

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Your head is bald
Your cheek is pale

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
You're growing old
That's what they say

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
Do we know this one?
Do we know this?

31:20.000 --> 31:26.000
The closer to death I drift each day
The louder must I sing and...

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
Hello! We're here!

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
I found them!

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
It's OK. He's come for you, yeah.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
You can go to him. Go on, go.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
Go on.

32:11.000 --> 32:15.000
So tell me,
which one is the naughtiest?

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
Me.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
-Him.
-It's definitely him.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
-Who is the brightest?
-None of us.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
-Him.
-Him.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
I have got a question for you.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
What's the most powerful thing
in the world?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
-Gold.
-Silver and gold.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
And you? What would you say
is the thing most powerful?

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
I'd say the thing
most powerful was love.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Piss off.

32:56.000 --> 33:00.000
-I love love.
-I said shut it.

33:00.000 --> 33:05.000
-Love?
-Yeah. It is love.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
Harka and Veran lived for centuries
in complete happiness.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Then one day, Harka disappeared.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
When he returned, he'd changed.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
He was silent, sullen.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
Then one day the Gods told Harka
to gather a dozen stones,

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
arrange them in a circle
and in the center,

33:38.000 --> 33:41.000
plant an oak tree by a lake.
It was called...

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
There's something I need to tell you.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
-Why do I think this is not good?
-I had a vision.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
-When?
-After we left the Dell.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I'm telling you now.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
What did you see?

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
A man. A thin man.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
His face was dark.
He had piercing eyes.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
On his palm, there was a symbol.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
What symbol?

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
What you saw was a hallucination.
Nothing more.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
-I don't understand.
-You saw nothing.

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
-Strike it from your mind. Do as I say!
-But...

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Hello.

35:15.000 --> 35:20.000
There is a lake in the west.
It is our most sacred place.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
If the Maiden is truly the chosen one

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
and fulfills her tasks
to the Air, to the Earth,

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
the Water and the Fire,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
on the Seventh Moon,

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
she will arrive at the Lake of Tears...

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
Where is the Lake?

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
It lies in the lands of the Devni.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
But its location is secret.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Known to three alone...

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Veran...

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Harka, the Dead Man...

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
..and a third, the Keeper.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
Who is the Keeper?

36:12.000 --> 36:13.000
You do not know her.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
But you know one of her kin.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
Thank you.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
You may go, but know this.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
There will come a day in the future
when I will call upon you.

36:40.000 --> 36:45.000
When that time comes, you must be ready.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Hello.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Hello?

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
Leave us!

38:12.000 --> 38:17.000
So come on. What's my task,
the one you've been saving me for?

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
Well, it's very important and dangerous.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
So I'm not sure whether
you're the right person.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
I'm ready.

38:26.000 --> 38:32.000
Have you heard of a tribe in the west
called the Devni?

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
-I know the lands you speak of.
-You do?

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
I was born there. My sister is queen.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
Well, it's a small world, isn't it?

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
You look like you've seen a ghost.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
I'm tired of long journeys.
Find someone else this time.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
-She's your sister. It's perfect.
-I haven't seen her in ten years.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
-Blood is thicker than water, isn't it?
-Please.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
I intend to have those lands
one way or another.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
This way, your sister gets a chance
to see sense.

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
Same old drill.
Sell her peace and taxes.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Get her relaxed about our Gods
being no threat to theirs.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
And if you can't convince her...

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
..I'll have my men nearby
ready to persuade her.

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
-Who goes there?
-I'm Queen Amena of the Cantii.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
Sister to Queen Andra.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Where is she, boy?

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
Show me. Where is she?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Where is she, boy?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Show me!

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
There you are.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Strange.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
What is?

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
The rain... Tastes of salt.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
We're near the sea.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
What's wrong?

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
Nothing. We must begin.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Let's begin.
