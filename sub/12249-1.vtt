02:32.528 --> 02:33.696
I'm hungover as shit.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.323
And you're really starting
to cut into my vacation time,

02:36.407 --> 02:37.408
so can we go, please?

02:39.410 --> 02:40.536
We'll take my car. Come on.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.288
(SCOFFS) I don't think so.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.002
Why you making...
Why are you gonna make this difficult?

02:49.253 --> 02:52.882
What's difficult? He turns himself in.
Then it's easy.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.051
Turns himself in. Why would he do that?

02:58.304 --> 03:00.264
What exactly did he say I did?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.975
He didn't. He just said
to come pick you up.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.603

No, I wish.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.580
Just a coffee. Black.

- Hi.

05:30.539 --> 05:33.542
You're gonna fix my arm while we drive.
Okay, Scott?

05:33.625 --> 05:34.835
Yeah.

(TAPE RIPPING)

05:55.022 --> 05:58.484
- Okay.
- Now take two of the dry packets,

05:58.567 --> 06:01.528
put them on the one
you already have in place.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.948
- Yeah?
- Now take the tape,

06:05.032 --> 06:08.118
wrap it around the gauze
so it stays on my arm.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.164
- Tight.
- Yeah.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.582
- Sorry.
- Couple times around.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.417
- Watch your arm.
- Yeah.

06:17.086 --> 06:19.505
Okay, now tape... Use
the scissors to cut it.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.341
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.593
That should be good for now.

Thank you.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.769
Yeah, sure.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.855
So, who...

06:36.939 --> 06:38.482
Who was that guy?

06:38.565 --> 06:41.110
- I mean, honestly.
- Aaron?

06:41.193 --> 06:43.278
Someone I worked with.

06:43.362 --> 06:47.324
- Was he your... You know.
- No.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.617
No.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.577
Where did you work with him?

06:50.661 --> 06:52.079
Barcelona.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.166
I...

06:56.250 --> 06:59.169
I don't mean to, you know, get personal.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.880
- Are you in the drug business?
- No.

07:01.964 --> 07:04.425
Are you with the government?

07:04.508 --> 07:06.885
They contracted a company I work for.

07:06.969 --> 07:10.013
Private company.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.516
Wow. That's actually real?

07:12.599 --> 07:15.060
- Oh, yeah.
- That makes sense.

07:15.144 --> 07:16.728
So what do you do? What's your job?

07:20.315 --> 07:22.109
Barcelona. Separatists?

07:22.818 --> 07:24.778
No, no. It's clean.

07:24.862 --> 07:28.365
Negotiations broke down,
just need somebody to go and get the guy.

07:30.659 --> 07:31.994

<i>this fee structure is unacceptable.</i>

07:48.677 --> 07:49.678
Intelligence?

07:49.845 --> 07:53.348
Yeah, I need parity with Rodrigo here
and all his people.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.355
Yes.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.900
You like it?

08:03.817 --> 08:06.820
I like the idea of me doing my job

08:06.904 --> 08:09.740
more than the idea
of someone else doing my job.

08:09.823 --> 08:14.328
COBLENZ: All right, now the immunity
language is as good as we can do.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.872
Fee structure... A number?

08:17.372 --> 08:19.333
Yeah, we need to adjust the overall payment

08:19.416 --> 08:22.336
in order that we can address things
like hazard bumps.

08:22.586 --> 08:26.632
I'll make a list.
But also how the installments are spaced.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.383
Fewer steps.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.636
Hi.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.261
Hey.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.639
What, am I first?

08:33.722 --> 08:37.518
Yeah, Victor will be here at 4:30,
and Jamie's running late.

COBLENZ:
<i>There's always a cash flow problem.</i>

08:42.563 --> 08:45.567
This is a short timetable, Kenneth.
Should I be nervous?

08:46.235 --> 08:47.402
If it will make you feel better,

08:47.486 --> 08:50.906
you can get the people
that did the Mexico job, Alex.

08:54.243 --> 08:56.662
Look, I know it's more efficient
if we wait for everybody to get here,

08:56.745 --> 09:00.874
but you want to start going through this?
I've got some ideas.

09:00.958 --> 09:05.295
You're right. It's more efficient
if we wait for everyone to get here.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.509
This should be fun.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.719
- Your kit's under your bed.
- Yours check out?

09:12.803 --> 09:16.515
- Good to go.
- I'll check later then, thank you.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.601
There's no smoking in here.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.103
Oh, okay.

09:23.939 --> 09:25.566
It's a phone.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.528
RODRIGO: <i>Tell me about Kenneth.</i>

09:30.946 --> 09:33.073
What about him?

09:33.156 --> 09:36.159
How long have you worked together?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.786
Three years.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.416
Not so long.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.002
It is in this business.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.169
COBLENZ: <i>You said four points.</i>

09:46.628 --> 09:49.006
You have Mallory Kane
as an essential element.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.048
Is that a problem?

09:50.132 --> 09:52.593
Not a good precedent for me,
for my business.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.636
Well, it doesn't work for us
if she's not involved.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.305
She's not available.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.891
You mind if I call and check on that?

10:01.810 --> 10:04.021
I didn't realize
your interest extended to personnel.

10:04.104 --> 10:08.150
No, no. No, when somebody's good,
it comes to my attention.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.153
It's come to my attention
you're spreading yourself a little thin.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.655
Kenneth, I don't want your B-team.
She's value-added.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.742
Only reason we came to you.

10:19.036 --> 10:20.579
All right, I'll free her up.

10:20.662 --> 10:23.832
And I'll forego the hazard bumps
if you remove the essential element clause.

10:23.915 --> 10:26.752
- That important, huh?
- Do you want her in Barcelona or not?

11:34.736 --> 11:38.490
AARON: <i>Explain it to me then.
So I can understand it.</i>

11:38.907 --> 11:40.784
How are we not light?

11:41.535 --> 11:43.995
So we have a man in the car,
we got a man at the door.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.831
Leaves you two to breach with.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.083
You're going hot on a hostage rescue.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.335
There's two rooms inside.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.337
So, the way I read it,

11:52.421 --> 11:55.799
you're either two men short in one room,
or you're one man short in each room.

11:57.342 --> 11:58.844
Anyone else think we're light?

12:00.053 --> 12:01.179
Us?

12:02.264 --> 12:03.432
No way.

Paul has presented himself
as one half of a power couple.

23:20.483 --> 23:21.943
This is your pitch?

23:22.151 --> 23:23.694
You want me to be eye candy?

23:23.778 --> 23:25.905
MI6 wants me to be eye candy?

23:26.155 --> 23:28.032
Mallory, you are the eye.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.578
I don't even know how to play that.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.914
I don't wear the dress.

23:34.997 --> 23:38.751
- Make Paul wear the dress.
- Well, I'll ask.

23:38.835 --> 23:42.922
Look, do this and then we'll go away
afterwards. We'll go to Majorca.

23:44.298 --> 23:47.301
- Majorca?
- Not like before, as friends.

23:47.385 --> 23:48.886
You can take a break.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.014
It's literally two days.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.809
Paul. That's Paul.

23:57.061 --> 23:59.939
You guys would be like the perfect couple.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.652
So he'll know you.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.532
I need this to happen.

24:25.715 --> 24:27.341
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:33.598 --> 24:36.058
My better half. You look great.

25:48.631 --> 25:50.758
Mind if I freshen up first?

25:51.759 --> 25:54.178
Presumably, you'll need more time.

Of course.

- I'm leaving my gun.
- Me, too.

- Both parents, still going strong.

31:16.834 --> 31:19.795
- They know what you do?
- No.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.547
I can never lie to my dad.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.090
Then he must worry about you.

31:23.173 --> 31:24.925
I tell him not to.

31:27.720 --> 31:29.722
Still keeping tabs?

31:29.805 --> 31:31.974
I hate babysitting jobs.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.355
That guy just recognized me.

31:38.439 --> 31:40.983
- Who?
- Gray shirt, gray tie, goatee.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.197
- You sure?
- Yeah.

31:47.281 --> 31:48.449
Why would he know you?

31:48.532 --> 31:53.078
'Cause the last time I saw him,
I was in Baghdad in my hotel room.

31:53.162 --> 31:55.748
All right. Here comes our friend.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.629
Well, it's obvious you're newlyweds.

32:01.712 --> 32:04.131
Still talking to each other
instead of the other guests.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.592
- Oh, I'm sorry. Are we being rude?
- No, no.

32:06.675 --> 32:09.053
- Katie, Eric Studer.
- Hi.

32:09.136 --> 32:13.474
Listen, I had some brainwave.
What are you two doing afterwards?

32:13.682 --> 32:16.143
- Well, I don't know. You're jet-lagged, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:16.769 --> 32:19.396
No, I'm sorry. I mean tomorrow, this week.

32:19.480 --> 32:20.856
No particular plans.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.317
- We were going back to London.
- London?

32:25.903 --> 32:27.071
I may have better than this.

32:27.821 --> 32:29.365
We're going to Saint Moritz.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.533
- "We"?
- Yeah, some friends.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.578
It'll be fun. We'll fly in,
put you up at a Suvretta.

32:34.662 --> 32:36.664
- Well...
- Do you ski?

32:36.747 --> 32:39.750
- Snowboard.
- These are the Alps, they're pretty steep.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.961
Like the prices. We'll discuss it.

32:42.044 --> 32:44.380
No, no, no discussion. We go.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.006
I'll send the itinerary to your hotel.

Maybe Saturday, if we're lucky.

35:04.144 --> 35:06.772
Katie. You haven't promised to come skiing.

35:06.855 --> 35:09.399
I can't even find my way around here.

35:09.483 --> 35:12.069

01:00:32.004 --> 01:00:33.839
Shit! Watch the car!

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:43.557
That was nice. That was nice.
That was really bad.

01:00:43.641 --> 01:00:44.933
I thought
that was gonna be really bad for a second.

01:00:45.017 --> 01:00:46.977
I thought I was gonna have a heart attack.
Oh, my God.

01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:49.897

are not federal agents.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.761
Great, great. How are you gonna
get out of this, may I ask?

01:04:07.845 --> 01:04:11.056
I'll just dump the car.
I'll find another ride. I'll catch a bus.

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:12.724
Great, good luck with that.

- Listen, when we split,

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:19.189
I'm gonna give you a number to call.

01:04:19.273 --> 01:04:22.484

sleeping in late today,

01:04:22.568 --> 01:04:24.444

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:25.863
Scott, you still with me?

01:04:25.946 --> 01:04:29.241
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, a number.
- Just tell them everything.

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:32.369
Tell the police, too,
tell them everything I've told you, okay?

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:34.329
- Yeah, okay.
- You did great.

01:04:34.413 --> 01:04:36.915
- You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:41.086
This is the trouble
with the private sector, Kenneth.

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:44.423
You got that macho takedown,
but where's the due diligence?

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:45.757
Where's the follow-through?

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:50.554
Now, we got ourselves a real twizzler here.

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:53.348
And for eight figures,
I don't accept excuses,

01:04:53.432 --> 01:04:56.518
explanations or rationales.

01:04:56.602 --> 01:04:59.062
Now I don't even know
why the hell you're standing here.

01:04:59.146 --> 01:05:02.441
You should be in her father's living room,
explaining to him,

01:05:02.524 --> 01:05:06.612
telling him that his daughter
is a fugitive with ties to terrorists.

01:05:06.695 --> 01:05:09.907
That she killed a man in cold blood
in Dublin and killed four cops.

01:05:11.283 --> 01:05:12.784
You tell him.

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:15.120
Show him.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:29.509
Keep bringing up Barcelona.

01:05:29.593 --> 01:05:31.803
Get him arguing with Kenneth.

01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:33.889
Kenneth.

01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:37.559
My fault. I should've seen that one coming.

01:05:37.643 --> 01:05:39.728
You did.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:44.066
Hold up a sec, Mal.
Let's analyze your options.

01:05:44.149 --> 01:05:46.485
We could leave right now, disappear.

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:49.655
We could be in Buenos Aires
this time tomorrow.

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:54.868
I'm not gonna run any more.

01:05:58.372 --> 01:06:02.417
KENNETH: <i>Mr. Kane, these were taken
by the police. They're pretty graphic.</i>

01:06:04.586 --> 01:06:06.922
<i>Her prints are all over the room.</i>

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:10.717
<i>The security video shows them
coming in together and her leaving alone.</i>

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:14.471
<i>The guest downstairs
complained about the noise.</i>

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:16.264
<i>Paul fought back,</i>

01:06:16.348 --> 01:06:18.684
<i>but she obviously had
the element of surprise in her favor.</i>

01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:22.020
<i>She choked him out
and she shot him in the head.</i>

01:06:23.689 --> 01:06:27.734
Add that to the four police,
and that is five dead in three days.

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:32.155
- Where was she last seen?
- Upstate New York, 36 hours ago.

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:35.659
- Was she alone?
- No, she was with a boy, 19.

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:38.495
She grabbed him at gunpoint.
Used him as a ride and a shield,

01:06:38.578 --> 01:06:41.456
so we can add aggravated kidnapping
to the murder charges.

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:45.002
No, I'm sorry.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:48.422
This doesn't sound like my daughter.

01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:54.052
She ever mention the name Kenneth?

01:06:54.136 --> 01:06:55.595
No.

01:06:56.388 --> 01:06:58.140
KENNETH: Really?

01:06:58.223 --> 01:07:00.684
He runs the company she worked for.

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:04.855
They were in a relationship for over a year,
and yet she never mentioned him to you?

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:07.649
What do you know about her?

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:09.985
Really, at the end of the day?

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:11.695
I raised her.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.823
KENNETH: <i>And denial is
a very effective parenting tool.</i>

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:16.366
MR. KANE: <i>She was a Marine.
She does something,</i>

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:17.909
<i>there must be a reason for it.</i>

01:07:17.993 --> 01:07:21.663
<i>Mr. Kane, she is no longer</i> a <i>Marine
She is</i> a <i>murderer.</i>

01:07:21.747 --> 01:07:24.291
<i>She is a public threat.
She's on a killing spree.</i>

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:28.712
Now, you are the only person
that she can trust.

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:31.089
You're gonna help bring her in
before she kills again.

01:07:31.173 --> 01:07:33.759
Without you, she won't survive this.

01:07:45.145 --> 01:07:46.938
I heard from her.

01:07:48.607 --> 01:07:49.608
Ten days ago.

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:53.195
She texted me,
said she was going to Barcelona.

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:55.822
What did she say exactly?

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:58.784
"Going to Barcelona. Call you after."

01:07:58.867 --> 01:08:00.869
Six words, that's it?

01:08:00.952 --> 01:08:02.412
Well, it was enough for me.

01:08:02.496 --> 01:08:05.040
And she didn't mention Dublin?
She didn't say anything about this?

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:06.208
No.

01:08:09.127 --> 01:08:10.712
Who was he?

01:08:10.796 --> 01:08:13.673
He was an agent with British Intelligence.

01:08:14.633 --> 01:08:18.595
Now, whether this was a murder-for-hire
or a crime of passion, we don't know.

01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:20.138
Well, she would never kill someone
for money.

01:08:20.221 --> 01:08:21.430
There must be an explanation.

01:08:21.515 --> 01:08:24.350
Didn't this all start after Barcelona?

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:26.728
Maybe that has something to do
with why she's a fugitive.

01:08:26.812 --> 01:08:28.229
Something must have happened there.

You need to stop pretending

01:09:23.702 --> 01:09:26.328
you can achieve a desirable outcome
in this situation,

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.124

You knew she was here?

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:56.896
- What did you do?
- I did what I was contracted to do.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.565
We were contracted to rescue somebody.

01:11:59.149 --> 01:12:00.984
<i>It seems to me, you auctioned
him off and tried to burn her.</i>

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:02.444
KENNETH: <i>That's not what happened.</i>
AARON: <i>Really?</i>

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:03.862
KENNETH: <i>No, I can explain.</i>
AARON: <i>Then explain it,</i>

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:05.530
and try really hard.

01:12:09.576 --> 01:12:10.827

No, just go help her!

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.376
- Kenneth!
- He's gone.

01:13:34.702 --> 01:13:36.329
You better run.

01:14:11.156 --> 01:14:14.576
Can't believe I met you a week ago.

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:16.661
Eight, eight days.

01:14:19.747 --> 01:14:22.375
We were in Barcelona eight days ago?

01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:29.007

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:37.075
Sweetheart?

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:50.797
(WHISPERING) It's okay.

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.925
In the auction business,
they have an expression

01:16:36.009 --> 01:16:38.636
called "the halo effect."

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.763
You know what that is?

01:16:40.972 --> 01:16:44.350
It's when an object or work of art
is more desirable

01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:46.686
because of its prior ownership.

01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:52.191
Very rare when it happens, you know?
Maybe once in a lifetime.

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:55.486
Gotta catch it when you can.

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:02.035
Look, I got plenty of
drama in my own office.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.828
You were his contact.

01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:06.080
No, I was his employer.

01:17:06.164 --> 01:17:08.499
There's a very big difference, trust me.

01:17:08.583 --> 01:17:10.084
There's only one person I trust.

01:17:10.168 --> 01:17:12.587
Your dad, yes. He okay?

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:16.007
He's fine. Thanks for cleaning up.

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:21.346
Well, I told you you can have Kenneth
alone at the house. I promised you that.

01:17:21.429 --> 01:17:24.599
It should at least make me a colleague,

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:26.726
if not a friend.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:29.187
And if something happens to you?

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:31.105
Well, then you're screwed.

01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:32.982
One friend's not a lot.

01:17:33.066 --> 01:17:35.693
It depends on who it is.

01:17:35.777 --> 01:17:39.572
- And the kid who helped me?
- We'll fix the ding in his car.

01:17:40.865 --> 01:17:43.743
Okay, I will buy him a new car.

01:17:44.869 --> 01:17:47.205
What is that, an incentive?

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:50.375
It could be.

01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:51.959
You gotta admit

01:17:52.043 --> 01:17:54.671
that this type of life appeals
to a certain kind of person.

01:17:54.754 --> 01:17:58.841
You know? You're off the grid,
you never answer to anybody.

01:17:59.926 --> 01:18:02.387
Always looking over your shoulder.

01:18:03.388 --> 01:18:07.725

of information, isn't it?

<i>Possible sightings in Veracruz.</i>

01:18:26.077 --> 01:18:30.248
But what would be nice to know
is what he gave everything up for.

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:36.170
So we're back to the government option.

01:18:36.254 --> 01:18:39.132
Pays less, taxes are taken out.

- Tide's coming in.

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:12.803
It was a journalist, a dissident.

A dissident journalist,
a scientist, what does it matter?

01:22:16.641 --> 01:22:18.392
It mattered to someone. Who?

He won't be in a position to.

Put a bullet in him,

01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:28.129
plant the broach on him, and then kill her
when you get back to the hotel.

- Self-defense.
- Of course.

01:23:35.302 --> 01:23:39.557
I'm assuming the motive of everyone
involved is strictly professional?

01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:44.645
Paul, the motive is money.

01:23:44.729 --> 01:23:46.981
