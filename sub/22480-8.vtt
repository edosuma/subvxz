WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.577
I shot Idrisi, twice!

00:01.613 --> 00:03.338
There's no way he's
getting back up from that.

00:03.362 --> 00:06.218
- Is he alive?
- It's true, he's alive.

00:07.223 --> 00:08.509
The drop was a setup!

00:08.609 --> 00:09.962
They've taken Jensen!

00:10.040 --> 00:13.485
Project Tenebrae, that's the real enemy.

00:13.946 --> 00:16.520
If Idrisi's alive, we need to
find out which black site he's in.

00:16.556 --> 00:20.021
There's a site I redesigned,
you might manage to find a way

00:20.075 --> 00:22.423
in, but there's no way
you'll ever get out.

00:22.459 --> 00:24.986
- Will.
- I told her about the farmhouse.

00:25.034 --> 00:27.101
Boss, do you copy?
Operation compromised.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:47.095 --> 00:48.135
Jawedan.

00:49.815 --> 00:51.149
Can you walk?

00:52.015 --> 00:53.135
I think so.

01:44.150 --> 01:48.394
We need to go. Omair, we need to go.

01:48.484 --> 01:53.077
My father, he gave this
to me when I was twelve.

01:55.630 --> 01:58.135
Before he died... he...

02:02.470 --> 02:03.640
Omair!

02:04.092 --> 02:05.334
Omair.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.515
- Can you hear me?
- Can you hear me?!

02:07.551 --> 02:10.334
Omair! Omair!

02:14.774 --> 02:19.069
Tell me about the terrorist cells
in Nangarhar. Give me some names.

02:19.167 --> 02:22.847
- Locations. Or we go again.
- He's had enough.

02:24.855 --> 02:25.954
He keeps dying.

02:26.048 --> 02:29.179
We keep bringing him back, the
human body can only take so much.

02:29.239 --> 02:33.219
And in a month, he hasn't given us
a single piece of actionable intel.

02:39.384 --> 02:40.944
We start again in an hour.

03:34.828 --> 03:37.454
- Sitrep.
- Clear.

03:37.990 --> 03:40.158
We're at the
last of Volkan's warehouses.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.074
How are the boys doing?

03:43.149 --> 03:45.502
McAlister and Wyatt are
en route to the black site.

03:45.576 --> 03:47.616
You just find out what
happened to Rachel Sheridan.

03:48.704 --> 03:49.815
Copy that.

04:10.510 --> 04:12.939
Careful. It could be rigged.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.142
Clear.

04:26.070 --> 04:28.752
Jesus. It's Rachel Sheridan.

04:35.621 --> 04:39.099
Rachel Sheridan's dead.
They've done a number on her.

04:40.790 --> 04:43.129
We have to assume that Jane
and Volkan got the location of

04:43.199 --> 04:45.039
the site, and are coming for Idrisi.

04:45.430 --> 04:46.830
I have no other choice.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.250
Your office told me where you were.

05:02.110 --> 05:03.590
There's a black site...

05:06.000 --> 05:07.285
in Klomino, Poland.

05:07.950 --> 05:10.543
Paid for with a Special
Operations slush fund

05:11.027 --> 05:12.150
and controlled by you.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.630
You know I can't talk
about this shit, Adeena.

05:15.480 --> 05:19.194
Jane Lowry knows Idrisi's
there. She took out Krieger,

05:19.230 --> 05:22.037
Sheridan. And now she's coming for him.

05:23.081 --> 05:27.165
You're telling me that I have
Omair Idrisi at this site.

05:27.350 --> 05:30.376
You are aware that I was the one
who ordered the MOP strike on him?

05:30.462 --> 05:32.222
Let's not waste time being cute.

05:32.310 --> 05:34.665
D'you have any evidence or
solid facts to support these

05:34.720 --> 05:35.990
ludicrous claims?

05:36.060 --> 05:37.674
Your site is off the grid.

05:37.878 --> 05:39.809
That means if anything
happens, there's no backup,

05:39.833 --> 05:41.518
no reinforcements.

05:41.573 --> 05:42.771
Tighten your security.

05:42.818 --> 05:44.611
You really want me to get on
the phone to your people and tell

05:44.635 --> 05:47.856
them you're slinging around
unfounded accusations like this?

05:47.919 --> 05:50.780
Jesus, Adeena. You'll be a laughing stock.

05:50.863 --> 05:52.614
We're both on the same side here.

05:53.305 --> 05:56.366
Our intel is that Jane Lowry
is going to the black site.

05:56.475 --> 06:00.370
That isn't going to
change. We need to stop her.

06:14.590 --> 06:16.070
Parker gave me nothing.

06:16.465 --> 06:18.720
I see no other option. Mission is a go.

06:18.783 --> 06:22.586
Get to Idrisi before Jane does,
secure him and bring him out.

06:22.664 --> 06:26.470
And if you run into her,
don't leave her alive.

06:28.449 --> 06:30.409
Copy that.

06:32.830 --> 06:34.917
Pretty regular sweep of guard patrols.

06:34.972 --> 06:36.772
That's a good time to go underground.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.950
It wasn't your fault,
mate, what happened to Lila.

07:15.950 --> 07:19.071
I know exactly what is and
isn't my fault, McAllister.

07:19.745 --> 07:21.665
I'm just staying on mission.

07:33.790 --> 07:35.462
What are you doing here?

07:37.482 --> 07:40.340
Work. Where's the team?

07:41.277 --> 07:44.072
McAllister and Wyatt are
infiltrating the black site.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.794
Reynolds and Novin have
found Rachel Sheridan dead.

07:47.039 --> 07:48.769
And you are going back to hospital.

07:48.805 --> 07:50.635
- To do what?
- To recover.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.351
No. No, sorry, ma'am,
I've got a job to do here.

07:54.990 --> 07:57.013
I'm up to speed
on the black site, alright?

07:58.710 --> 08:00.677
You have the comms, Lance Corporal.

08:11.110 --> 08:12.430
Bravo, send sitrep.

08:14.110 --> 08:17.096
Johnson, is that you?
Back at work already?

08:17.752 --> 08:18.829
Respect.

08:19.070 --> 08:21.310
Just living for the day, you
get my name right, Sergeant.

08:21.408 --> 08:23.238
Well, you're gonna be living a long time.

08:23.847 --> 08:25.676
We're entering the arterial tunnel now.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.354
Copy that.

08:27.471 --> 08:29.592
Comms'll be out the moment you
get beyond the perimeter, they'll

08:29.616 --> 08:32.047
have a pretty sophisticated
jamming system in there.

08:32.125 --> 08:35.302
The black site itself will be
fairly rudimentary, but Sheridan

08:35.366 --> 08:37.433
retrofitted the old Soviet base with

08:37.503 --> 08:40.187
a system of emergency lockdowns
that you really don't want to

08:40.222 --> 08:41.427
be the ones to trigger.

08:41.549 --> 08:43.446
Yeah, we're screwed. Got it.

08:43.509 --> 08:44.672
It's good to hear your voice, mate.

08:44.696 --> 08:45.816
- Ready?
- Yep.

08:46.130 --> 08:47.588
1, 2, 3.

08:57.847 --> 08:58.927
Good luck.

09:00.030 --> 09:01.568
See you on the other side.

09:10.703 --> 09:11.903
Comms are now out.

09:16.464 --> 09:19.064
Have you heard of something
called Project Tenebrae, ma'am?

09:22.410 --> 09:27.325
Lowry said something about it being
the real enemy, erm, before she, er...

09:30.905 --> 09:33.509
I don't know, it just seemed important.

09:33.597 --> 09:35.319
You should look into it.

09:35.405 --> 09:37.905
But right now, we should
focus on the mission.

09:52.071 --> 09:53.711
You son of a bitch.

10:01.504 --> 10:03.421
Can you make a bit more noise?

10:03.466 --> 10:04.809
It's rusted.

10:26.006 --> 10:27.312
Jesus, Jensen!

10:28.320 --> 10:29.453
Captain.

10:30.204 --> 10:32.151
Er, I'm glad you're here, actually. Er...

10:32.280 --> 10:34.277
Er... Donovan asked me to look
into something while she was gone,

10:34.301 --> 10:36.452
and... and I've found I
need second level clearance.

10:36.519 --> 10:38.359
I don't believe this.

10:38.533 --> 10:39.937
It concerns Lowry.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.413
You shouldn't be at work.

10:42.931 --> 10:44.175
Captain, time is an issue.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.331
And, er, Donovan's not
due back for a while.

10:47.144 --> 10:48.144
Alright.

11:02.545 --> 11:07.489
Captain. Sorry, erm, do you
mind if we have the room?

11:08.225 --> 11:09.265
Yeah, of course.

11:10.745 --> 11:11.785
It's done.

11:16.701 --> 11:17.701
Erm...

11:18.402 --> 11:20.482
Jensen, it's good to have you back.

11:31.848 --> 11:33.456
What the fuck are you doing here?

11:36.989 --> 11:37.910
Following up a lead.

11:37.946 --> 11:40.179
No. Here. Back at work.

11:40.226 --> 11:41.706
It hasn't even been twentyfour hours.

11:41.745 --> 11:44.563
I don't blame you, if
that's what you're worried about.

11:44.599 --> 11:46.839
Yeah? You should!

11:48.683 --> 11:51.645
I left you in the car and you
weren't even meant to be in

11:51.681 --> 11:52.869
the fucking field.

11:52.905 --> 11:54.317
Can this not wait?

12:00.545 --> 12:02.499
Have you looked at yourself, Will?

12:12.795 --> 12:15.995
Have you looked at what
they've done to ya? Have you?

12:30.395 --> 12:31.995
Why are you doing this?

12:36.275 --> 12:39.548
This fucking life, it's not for you.

12:40.555 --> 12:41.795
It's not.

12:48.238 --> 12:49.358
Please.

12:53.995 --> 12:57.227
Are we done here? Erm,
because this work isn't.

13:18.268 --> 13:19.308
Clear.

13:24.717 --> 13:26.597
- Move.
- Moving.

13:40.225 --> 13:42.385
Black site secure zone dead ahead.

13:49.105 --> 13:52.055
Shit! Is that a metal
detector? Rachel Sheridan never

13:52.130 --> 13:53.323
mentioned that.

13:54.403 --> 13:55.927
If we go through there all geared up,

13:56.017 --> 13:57.860
we'll have every alarm
in the place ringing.

14:14.265 --> 14:15.465
What are you doing?

14:15.654 --> 14:17.854
You watch my back from
here. I'll check ahead.

14:19.248 --> 14:20.448
Unarmed?

14:20.596 --> 14:21.916
You know another way round?

14:29.049 --> 14:31.509
And while we're talking, I don't know.

14:31.604 --> 14:32.869
You don't know what?

14:32.936 --> 14:34.816
What I'm going to do
when I see Idrisi again.

14:36.113 --> 14:38.099
Why the hell are you telling me this now?

14:39.675 --> 14:44.327
Out of respect. Besides, you
can't shout at me, can you?

14:52.588 --> 14:53.748
Asshole.

15:41.091 --> 15:42.091
Set.

15:43.050 --> 15:46.810
1, 2...

15:50.065 --> 15:53.465
We're on high alert. Who gave
you permission to open the cell?

15:53.945 --> 15:55.967
Erm, Doctor Pryce needed
to see the patient.

15:56.041 --> 15:58.481
Pryce, what the hell are you playing at?

16:00.218 --> 16:01.218
Shit!

16:32.970 --> 16:33.970
Mac?

16:36.785 --> 16:37.785
Mac?

16:40.087 --> 16:41.167
Shit!

16:58.785 --> 17:00.545
Adrenaline. It will help.

17:02.985 --> 17:05.317
I've taken care of immediate
security, but there'll be more

17:05.383 --> 17:06.983
in the area, coming this way.

17:25.279 --> 17:29.103
Captain, Parker's running a
rogue op for his own glory.

17:29.181 --> 17:31.549
At least that means going in
and grabbing Idrisi won't cause

17:31.585 --> 17:33.109
an international incident.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.754
Did you give Jensen a
security override earlier?

17:35.801 --> 17:37.229
I received an alert.

17:37.294 --> 17:39.549
He was looking into intel on Lowry.

17:39.799 --> 17:41.610
I had denied him the request.

17:41.985 --> 17:43.700
He's barely able to function as it is.

17:43.774 --> 17:46.681
Lowry had access my
records, Wyatt's as well,

17:46.790 --> 17:48.189
something else is going on here.

17:48.271 --> 17:50.179
You don't think I'm aware of that?

17:51.385 --> 17:54.069
Right now, I'm trying to protect Jensen.

17:54.249 --> 17:57.719
No. Right now, you are
hiding something from me.

17:57.773 --> 18:00.893
We are not equals, Captain.
I have no duty to you.

18:04.665 --> 18:07.705
That's a geotag from Parker.
Why would he send me that?

18:08.688 --> 18:11.288
Get over there and find out
what the hell's going on.

18:18.428 --> 18:23.363
So, middle of the night,
I got an email from you.

18:25.265 --> 18:26.671
I didn't send you an email.

18:26.707 --> 18:28.827
Yeah, I know. You were
asleep, I could see that.

18:32.425 --> 18:34.145
You were in my hospital room?

18:37.367 --> 18:40.109
Point is, it was a link,

18:40.648 --> 18:43.907
to all of Will Jensen's files.

18:45.385 --> 18:47.858
It's an automated programme,
if I don't check in every

18:47.917 --> 18:49.363
twentyfour hours.

18:49.801 --> 18:52.041
It's just important to
keep everything backed up.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.429
Dude, I'm not a hard drive.

18:55.547 --> 18:58.675
No, you're...

18:58.711 --> 19:00.191
you're the person I trust.

19:05.780 --> 19:08.981
Gracie, saddle up. We're
going to check on Parker.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.219
Something might be up.

19:10.284 --> 19:11.284
- Copy.
- Alright.

19:14.059 --> 19:16.179
- Catch you later.
- Grace?

19:39.503 --> 19:41.423
Okara is in cell number five.

19:41.625 --> 19:44.149
We release all the prisoners, Doctor.

19:44.519 --> 19:48.090
Omair, these men, they see me as
the enemy, the things I've done.

19:48.215 --> 19:49.989
That is why you are helping me.?

19:50.740 --> 19:54.901
Why you risked everything
to place a call to my wife.

19:54.937 --> 19:59.963
To redeem yourself. We are all
prisoners of some kind, Doctor.

20:01.305 --> 20:04.281
We need Okara, to open the doors.

20:04.577 --> 20:07.810
We need to take it slowly;
The torture has taken its toll.

20:08.026 --> 20:09.619
Okara. Now.

20:14.185 --> 20:16.105
You promise they won't harm me?

20:17.105 --> 20:18.489
I give you my word.

21:09.785 --> 21:11.322
Who the hell are you?

21:11.392 --> 21:13.465
Sergeant Wyatt. How're you doing?

21:13.545 --> 21:15.109
Looks like I got here just in time.

21:15.294 --> 21:18.182
You broke in here? That's impossible.

21:18.218 --> 21:20.430
Call Colonel Parker. He'll vouch for me.

21:20.524 --> 21:22.533
- Mostly.
- Parker's not picking up.

21:24.372 --> 21:26.292
You just lost your eyes as well.

21:28.690 --> 21:30.601
Look, I've got a buddy on the
wrong side of your lockdown,

21:30.625 --> 21:31.762
Sergeant McAllister.

21:31.835 --> 21:34.160
I know Parker will have
warned you about Jane Lowry.

21:35.254 --> 21:36.612
That's why we're here.

21:36.784 --> 21:38.789
To make sure she doesn't
get what she wants.

21:38.901 --> 21:40.389
Or maybe you're here to help her.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.419
Come on.

21:45.995 --> 21:49.464
Okara. How long to open the doors?

21:50.065 --> 21:53.451
I don't work for you,
Idrisi. I work for myself.

21:54.331 --> 21:57.247
They told me there wasn't a
prison built that could hold you.

21:57.466 --> 22:00.230
They were right. Ten minutes.

22:00.855 --> 22:01.975
If we're lucky.

22:04.505 --> 22:06.869
Rachel Sheridan built a
backdoor into the site.

22:06.905 --> 22:09.161
It's via an arterial tunnel,
connected to the old drainage

22:09.185 --> 22:10.865
system, it's about half a klick from here.

22:11.318 --> 22:13.229
It's how me and my buddy got in.

22:13.356 --> 22:15.679
And right now, there's a chance
that Jane Lowry knows about it too.

22:15.703 --> 22:20.069
So just, just get some bodies down
there, guard it at least. Come on.

22:20.105 --> 22:22.905
I wouldn't be telling you this shit
if I was working with her, would I?

22:24.861 --> 22:28.632
Get me a patrol on the old drainage
system entrance, east of the site.

22:45.505 --> 22:46.903
Someone else is here.

22:47.296 --> 22:49.576
You two, go. Find... Find him.

23:23.047 --> 23:23.869
Who else is in here?

23:23.905 --> 23:25.585
Who else is in here, we gotta worry about?

23:25.799 --> 23:29.434
Ibrahim Okara. ExBoko Haram.

23:29.519 --> 23:33.359
Yeah, he's a nasty son of a
bitch. Listen, man, just get me...

23:33.395 --> 23:34.146
Hey, hey. Easy.

23:34.208 --> 23:36.685
Just get me in there. Just get me in
there, I'll bring it under control.

23:36.709 --> 23:38.838
I'll find my buddy, and
we'll bring it under control.

23:38.874 --> 23:40.274
No. No. That's not happening.

23:41.025 --> 23:43.508
The men in there are desperate, dangerous.

23:46.345 --> 23:48.105
If your friend is trapped
in there with them,

23:51.186 --> 23:52.746
then he's as good as dead.

23:58.875 --> 24:00.595
You, find a chair.

24:02.699 --> 24:03.699
Pick him up.

24:13.602 --> 24:14.602
Fuck off!

24:21.915 --> 24:23.835
Tell me what you are doing here.

24:25.155 --> 24:28.934
Had to see for myself. If it was true.

24:30.355 --> 24:32.417
How the fuck did you survive that?

24:33.555 --> 24:35.978
Turns out it was not my day to die.

24:43.518 --> 24:48.763
That whole plan you had,
Markov, the Novichok,

24:51.169 --> 24:53.349
we well and truly fucked that up for you.

24:56.395 --> 25:00.436
Good. You still have spirit.

25:03.181 --> 25:04.664
Something to break.

25:08.115 --> 25:09.532
Did you come alone?

25:09.618 --> 25:11.472
I wanted to make it extra special for you.

25:12.013 --> 25:13.789
Come on, don't lie to me.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.613
Where is your boyfriend, from the USA?

25:25.137 --> 25:27.001
So much for your reputation.

25:27.055 --> 25:30.220
I can get us out. But we're
talking hours. Not minutes.

25:30.256 --> 25:31.456
They have too many safeguards.

25:31.533 --> 25:34.953
Fortunately, I did not place
all my faith in you, Okara.

25:35.265 --> 25:38.230
You forget, our captors are blind.

25:40.493 --> 25:45.677
I have a hostage. Open
the doors before I execute.

25:59.515 --> 26:00.851
Come on. You gotta let me in there!

26:00.875 --> 26:01.601
Let me in there!

26:01.665 --> 26:02.665
I can't do that!

26:04.513 --> 26:06.516
Open the doors!

26:35.275 --> 26:39.462
Your father, he was a good man, Omair.

26:41.743 --> 26:45.626
He would not want you
to give into your anger.

26:46.395 --> 26:48.100
To seek revenge.

27:10.646 --> 27:11.846
Get the fuck off me!

27:17.809 --> 27:18.973
Alpha Team...

27:25.955 --> 27:28.781
You're thinking that 'this
guy won't actually hurt me'.

27:31.275 --> 27:32.795
This guy fucking will.

27:33.355 --> 27:36.322
Now open the fucking doors and let me in.

27:37.355 --> 27:39.322
Alright, last chance.

27:45.782 --> 27:51.274
No, no, no. Come on,
wake up. Wake up. Come on.

27:51.310 --> 27:52.310
C'mon...

27:54.195 --> 27:55.715
You, son of a bitch.

28:12.505 --> 28:14.795
Come on!

28:53.035 --> 28:54.035
Moving.

29:15.475 --> 29:16.515
Parker's family.

29:24.235 --> 29:25.542
Volkan has them.

29:34.476 --> 29:35.476
In.

29:59.435 --> 30:01.235
Lower your weapon, soldier.

30:03.741 --> 30:04.741
Volkan.

30:06.195 --> 30:08.115
Lower your weapon, soldier.

30:09.515 --> 30:11.039
Let them go.

30:11.075 --> 30:12.315
Lower it.

30:31.780 --> 30:33.224
You can't win this.

30:33.613 --> 30:38.284
Idrisi is alive. Do you have
any idea of what that means?

30:38.320 --> 30:40.480
What about when he
discovers what you've done,

30:41.880 --> 30:43.804
turning your back on your own people?

30:44.043 --> 30:48.403
What happens to me is not
important. He is all that matters.

31:01.995 --> 31:03.213
Volkan is dead.

31:03.910 --> 31:06.394
I repeat, Volkan is dead.

31:07.933 --> 31:09.747
Solid copy on that.

31:09.806 --> 31:13.090
Parker and his family were
held hostage, they've taken him.

31:13.774 --> 31:15.556
They must be using him to
gain access to the site.

31:15.580 --> 31:17.231
You need to get over
there, fast as you can.

31:17.255 --> 31:18.619
I'll try and contact Parker again.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.992
Open the doors!

31:34.933 --> 31:36.933
Open the doors!

31:48.475 --> 31:51.658
They are not opening the door.
They are not listening to you.

31:51.712 --> 31:53.079
Fuck you!

31:53.567 --> 31:55.302
Neither are we.

31:59.715 --> 32:03.371
But you're right. Maybe
a hostage is the way out.

32:04.435 --> 32:07.588
A bullet in the leg, one in the arm,

32:08.901 --> 32:10.901
we'll see how quickly
they'll open the door

32:11.495 --> 32:14.359
when their most valuable
prisoner is under threat.

32:14.395 --> 32:16.607
At least your name still
means something, Idrisi.

32:27.755 --> 32:30.195
Stay back! Back!

32:31.970 --> 32:33.087
Stay back!

32:54.075 --> 32:57.543
OK, fellas. We need to
get to the control room.

32:57.579 --> 32:58.728
We're in lockdown, sir!

32:58.764 --> 33:00.089
Come on guys, look at me.

33:00.125 --> 33:02.499
I'm Colonel Parker, I'm your
commanding officer and we

33:02.592 --> 33:04.999
need to get to the goddamn control room!

33:05.435 --> 33:08.044
Sir, I'm sorry, but we
can't open the doors.

33:10.070 --> 33:11.310
Sir?

33:13.717 --> 33:14.687
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:14.734 --> 33:18.479
Easy, easy. I hope you've come
to sort this shitstorm out.

33:18.659 --> 33:21.839
I'm sorry, buddy, you're going
to have to speak up, you know.

33:21.875 --> 33:25.068
Since Grozny, I am as deaf as a post.

33:51.058 --> 33:52.058
This way.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.430
You have to keep me alive?

34:03.903 --> 34:05.380
I'm just doing my job, alright?

34:05.416 --> 34:08.422
Yeah, but if you didn't,
no one would know.

34:09.040 --> 34:12.699
If it was the other way
around, I wouldn't hesitate.

34:12.782 --> 34:14.969
That's why I'm the good
guy and you're the bad guy.

34:16.641 --> 34:19.326
Your enemy is just
someone who's point of view

34:19.362 --> 34:21.042
you haven't understood yet.

34:22.529 --> 34:24.049
My father was a farmer.

34:24.085 --> 34:26.289
I know what all about your father.

34:26.324 --> 34:29.270
A western missile strike on an
incorrectly identified village.

34:31.643 --> 34:32.630
So you understand.

34:32.666 --> 34:35.862
Yeah, I understand that gave you
an excuse to act like a sociopath.

34:37.181 --> 34:39.788
Bombing hotels, bringing down airliners.

34:41.056 --> 34:42.576
What do you know...

34:49.310 --> 34:50.929
More men than bullets.

34:51.882 --> 34:53.242
Let's go.

35:15.911 --> 35:18.474
They had my whole family, Wyatt.
There was nothing I could do.

35:18.510 --> 35:20.468
The name Lila Hall mean anything to you?

35:21.130 --> 35:22.473
Her mother was Rachel Sheridan.

35:22.528 --> 35:25.052
And they're both dead because
you lied, you lied to everybody

35:25.088 --> 35:26.368
and you hid Idrisi away in here.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.949
What I do with men like Idrisi
is about keeping people safe!

35:28.985 --> 35:30.823
Bullshit! It's about stripes and medals.

35:30.902 --> 35:32.192
Now, I know you've got a way in there.

35:32.216 --> 35:33.749
Yeah, I've got another way in.

35:33.820 --> 35:35.779
I've got a way out, as
well, for both of us.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.524
Total deniability.

35:37.727 --> 35:41.765
We can walk away, you can get your
life back, you can go home again.

35:45.039 --> 35:47.514
Haven't you heard? I'm with Twenty now.

35:47.550 --> 35:49.070
Now you get me the hell in there!

35:51.319 --> 35:52.382
This way.

35:58.325 --> 36:01.303
You're the site director?
I'd like to see my husband.

36:01.352 --> 36:03.053
We're... We're in lockdown.

36:03.113 --> 36:06.098
- Well, take us out of it.
- I can't, the system's locked me out.

36:06.138 --> 36:08.946
I know who designed this
place. I watched her die.

36:09.001 --> 36:13.282
I also know that in lockdown, you
and Parker have the override keys.

36:18.225 --> 36:19.474
Move him!

36:23.205 --> 36:25.581
Listen, they don't care
about you. They want me.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.137
So use me as bait.

36:29.030 --> 36:30.750
You don't have enough bullets.

36:31.029 --> 36:34.386
And I will not survive in
the hands of a man like Okara.

36:37.948 --> 36:38.948
Wait!

36:40.272 --> 36:41.272
Stop!

36:41.989 --> 36:42.989
Don't move.

36:46.125 --> 36:47.454
Shhh.

36:49.336 --> 36:52.445
The British soldier. He's behind you.

37:00.894 --> 37:03.472
Do you think I am stupid, Idrisi?

37:31.630 --> 37:35.575
Drop it! Drop the weapon.

37:37.365 --> 37:38.958
Not today, habibie.

37:42.407 --> 37:44.838
Down, on the ground, now! Hands.

37:45.218 --> 37:46.218
Hands.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.742
It's nice to see you stayed on mission.

37:52.778 --> 37:54.698
Well, one of us has got
to do a proper job?

37:55.354 --> 37:57.502
Your boyfriend is rough.

37:57.934 --> 37:58.934
Move.

38:01.303 --> 38:02.427
How you doing, Omair?

38:02.534 --> 38:03.814
Fuck you!

38:09.746 --> 38:12.572
Faster.

38:12.645 --> 38:16.885
It's not opening. Whatever they've
been doing has jammed the locks.

38:26.022 --> 38:27.586
- Move, move, move!
- Go!

38:39.032 --> 38:40.152
Got it!

38:40.444 --> 38:42.044
Open the fucking door!

38:43.565 --> 38:47.283
I was the one who kept him alive,
you need to understand that.

38:58.021 --> 38:59.061
Contact.

39:01.327 --> 39:02.367
Get down!

39:06.605 --> 39:07.605
Changing.

39:09.879 --> 39:11.155
Shit! Moving!

39:13.030 --> 39:16.510
That's an ammo stack back there!
Lucky I wasn't blown to pieces.

39:17.593 --> 39:20.620
Shoot to the right. I'm running low.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.360
- I'm out.
- Empty.

39:29.396 --> 39:30.642
They're out of ammo!

39:31.799 --> 39:33.679
- Shut the fuck up!
- Go!

39:50.365 --> 39:52.895
Aren't you guys sick
of us savin' your asses?

39:52.961 --> 39:54.809
Highlight of my day. Moving!

39:59.125 --> 40:01.165
- Ammo dump eleven o'clock.
- Got it.

40:14.471 --> 40:15.671
Go!

40:24.824 --> 40:25.847
Sitrep.

40:27.839 --> 40:30.559
I... I've lost touch
with Novin and Reynolds.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.680
No word from Mac and Wyatt.

40:49.943 --> 40:52.427
Your wife and family are
at the NATO base in Zagan.

40:52.463 --> 40:53.463
Thank you, Captain.

40:53.574 --> 40:55.430
I've sealed the entrance,
it'll hold them a while,

40:55.454 --> 40:57.008
but, er, we need to get a move on.

40:57.105 --> 40:59.939
We need to talk about Idrisi,
what we're going to do with him.

41:00.014 --> 41:01.740
Yeah, sure, let's talk.

41:03.507 --> 41:05.507
We're gonna take him with us, Colonel.

41:08.701 --> 41:11.358
Which means you... you've
got a long walk home.

41:11.394 --> 41:13.486
MOP strike, asshole. Remember that?

41:13.574 --> 41:15.095
That's the second time
you've left me for dead.

41:15.119 --> 41:16.271
Let's go, Wyatt.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.590
I'm glad the family's okay.

41:18.656 --> 41:20.940
Fuck you, Sergeant.

41:20.976 --> 41:22.256
Fuck you too, Colonel.

41:44.725 --> 41:46.921
Maybe you should call it a day, Will.

41:46.957 --> 41:48.063
I think I've done it.

41:48.147 --> 41:49.311
You've done what?

41:50.145 --> 41:51.745
I think I've cracked it.

41:51.845 --> 41:55.045
I think... I think I've cracked the thing
that Lowry was talking about. Tenebrae.

41:55.550 --> 41:58.613
There weren't any, er,
references, or logs, or databases,

41:58.700 --> 41:59.280
or anything like that.

41:59.328 --> 42:03.881
But... But when you digitally remove
something, you can leave traces.

42:05.087 --> 42:06.643
I've been chasing the
ghosts in the machine.

42:06.667 --> 42:08.191
I told you to leave it for now.

42:09.367 --> 42:11.102
Never could resist a challenge.

42:24.007 --> 42:25.382
Wait, what?

42:25.831 --> 42:27.751
Hold on...

42:37.846 --> 42:41.896
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, Will. I'm sorry.

42:42.928 --> 42:45.412
I've got no choice. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

43:41.997 --> 43:44.043
We've got the package. Over.

43:49.642 --> 43:51.846
I won't sacrifice
all the good we've done

43:51.928 --> 43:53.538
for one mistake.

43:54.128 --> 43:55.772
You're asking me to eliminate

43:55.839 --> 43:57.127
my people?

43:58.398 --> 44:00.398
You have your orders.

44:02.688 --> 44:03.688
Yes, ma'am.
