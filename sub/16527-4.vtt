Hey, hey, hey,
do they even let you eat meat

00:19.372 --> 00:20.642

00:20.642 --> 00:21.577
ART:
Oh, hell no.

00:21.577 --> 00:25.317
You got to be a vegetarian
to move out there.

00:25.317 --> 00:28.758

00:59.987 --> 01:03.661

Yo, it's RJ.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.277

01:12.277 --> 01:13.681

What's up, man?

01:13.681 --> 01:15.818
Yo, what's up, man?
I'm chillin'!

01:15.818 --> 01:17.254

01:17.254 --> 01:20.728
Yo, your mama used to make

Wait, hold on.
Is your daddy still a, uh...

01:23.501 --> 01:24.569
A cop?

01:24.569 --> 01:26.272
Yeah.

01:26.272 --> 01:29.011
You selling
bootleg DVDs?

01:29.011 --> 01:30.447
I'm disappointed.

01:32.317 --> 01:34.288
Mainly in your collection.

01:34.288 --> 01:36.325

01:45.343 --> 01:46.613
(laughter)

01:55.898 --> 01:57.434
Morning.

01:58.336 --> 01:59.773
Come on.
Let's go.

02:04.448 --> 02:06.219
Are you homeless?

02:06.954 --> 02:08.323
Hey.

02:08.323 --> 02:09.860
No, I got a trailer

02:09.860 --> 02:11.262
up a ways.

02:11.262 --> 02:13.366
Not a lot of people,
which is great, but...

02:13.366 --> 02:15.538
no washing machine.
Hmm.

02:15.538 --> 02:18.476
You surf here a lot?
Yeah, my whole life.

02:18.476 --> 02:20.782
You ever heard
of a Laundromat?

02:20.782 --> 02:22.484
Aw, come on.

02:22.484 --> 02:24.388
Can't beat this view.

02:24.388 --> 02:26.359
You might want to
consider fluff n fold.

02:26.359 --> 02:28.764
Could help your look.

02:28.764 --> 02:31.435
There's nothing wrong
with my look.

02:31.435 --> 02:33.339
Hey, I don't look homeless!

02:35.912 --> 02:37.816
Man, this cut is all wrong.

02:37.816 --> 02:40.053
I want the Mohawk
with the fade on the side.

02:40.053 --> 02:43.627
Mohawks are only appropriate
for Native Americans and Mr. T.

02:43.627 --> 02:45.731
Why do we have to go
to Art's anyway?

02:45.731 --> 02:48.804
It's a 45‐minute drive, and
all they do is make fun of us.

02:48.804 --> 02:50.641
Boy, we don't go to Art's
for the cut.

02:50.641 --> 02:52.411
We go to connect
with our community,

02:52.411 --> 02:53.747
our roots.
(phone chimes)

02:56.052 --> 02:57.555
Marcus just texted me.

02:57.555 --> 02:59.091
We traded info.
He wants to hang.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.695
Good. You boys
should hang out.

03:00.695 --> 03:03.066
It'd be good for you
to spend a little time

03:03.066 --> 03:03.968
in the old hood, too.

03:03.968 --> 03:05.771
If you miss it so much,
why'd we leave?

03:05.771 --> 03:08.510
Your mother wanted
a better school district.

03:08.510 --> 03:09.913
So we moved here.

03:09.913 --> 03:11.783
Instead of community, we have...

03:11.783 --> 03:13.086
landscaping.

03:13.086 --> 03:15.758
And a safer house,
safer streets.

03:16.827 --> 03:18.363
(knocking)

03:18.363 --> 03:20.635
(laughs):
Hey, Martin.
Hi.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.471
Nice to see you.
Good to see you.

03:22.471 --> 03:24.341
Roger will be back any minute.

03:24.341 --> 03:26.012
All right,
can you say hi to Martin?

03:26.012 --> 03:27.715
Yes.
Uh, Trish?

03:27.715 --> 03:29.619
Hmm?
Can I ask you a question?

03:29.619 --> 03:30.988
Uh‐huh.

03:30.988 --> 03:32.959
Do I look homeless... to you?

03:32.959 --> 03:34.729
What? Of course not.

03:34.729 --> 03:36.566
I mean, sometimes you're
a little scruffy,

03:36.566 --> 03:38.136
but that's...
that's part of your charm.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.606
Right. Part of my charm.

03:39.606 --> 03:41.777
Oh, gosh. Could you
feed her for a second?

03:41.777 --> 03:43.781
Oh, um, I've never
fed anything.

03:43.781 --> 03:46.385
I mean, pigs, I had some
pigs‐‐ and a dog once,

03:46.385 --> 03:48.691
but it died. I...
Martin, spoon in, spoon out.

03:49.726 --> 03:51.596
(sighs)

03:54.970 --> 03:56.840
Okay.

03:58.944 --> 04:00.648
You want
to try something?

04:00.648 --> 04:03.453
Yeah. Yeah,
it doesn't look that...

04:03.453 --> 04:04.956
It does look bad,
doesn't it?

04:04.956 --> 04:06.125
Looks like glue.

04:06.125 --> 04:09.899
Yeah, look, watch. Mmm.

04:09.899 --> 04:11.837
That's really good.

04:17.582 --> 04:20.788
She didn't want any.

04:20.788 --> 04:21.790
Right?

04:23.660 --> 04:25.163
(laughing)

04:25.163 --> 04:29.171
DISPATCHER: We have a 459 on
the 1600 block of Sylmar Avenue.

04:29.171 --> 04:30.708
That's a break‐in

04:30.708 --> 04:32.745
six blocks back. Four‐king‐ten,

04:32.745 --> 04:33.847
I'm in the area.

04:33.847 --> 04:34.849
Copy that.

04:34.849 --> 04:36.620
Out. Now.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.456
Are you serious?
We're two blocks

04:38.456 --> 04:39.893
from the house;
walking builds character,

04:39.893 --> 04:41.930
and hopefully
some calf muscles.

04:44.101 --> 04:45.771
Man, this is child endangerment.

04:45.771 --> 04:47.775
Go on.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.219
MURTAUGH:

from coming true.

05:10.086 --> 05:11.923
What are you even doing here?

05:11.923 --> 05:14.061
I was at your place
when I heard the call.

05:14.061 --> 05:15.063
Wow.

05:15.063 --> 05:16.298
<i>That is one big human being.</i>

05:16.298 --> 05:18.169
MURTAUGH: <i>Yes, it is.</i>
<i>Backup's on the way.</i>

05:18.169 --> 05:20.908
Backup's already here. Let's go.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

05:20.908 --> 05:23.614
You're not gonna get
your cowboy on here.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.450
My cowboy?
Yeah.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.853
I am a police officer
responding to a call, sir.

05:26.853 --> 05:28.389

05:32.798 --> 05:36.472

Good to have you, Cruz.

We're going after some grade "A"
miscreants here.

this Bigfoot‐sized footprint

do that?

08:32.691 --> 08:34.094
Yeah, baby! Come on!

08:34.094 --> 08:36.031
Did an online search
for "Black Hulk."

having fun though.

19:01.782 --> 19:03.217
You got to bounce, bro.

19:03.217 --> 19:05.321
Where...
Now, yo!

19:06.825 --> 19:09.564
Yo, how am I supposed to
get back home, then?

19:09.564 --> 19:11.500
(tires screech)

19:13.839 --> 19:15.576
(sighs)

19:15.576 --> 19:18.715
This upstanding citizen
is John Baker,

19:18.715 --> 19:19.551
aka Boogie.

19:19.551 --> 19:21.487
He used to work for
Valley Star Cable,

19:21.487 --> 19:23.324
which is how he managed
to steal a van

19:23.324 --> 19:24.794
and use it for
his break‐in crew.

19:24.794 --> 19:27.499
Yo, Detective,
I'm‐a need a pat down,

19:27.499 --> 19:28.735
real up close
and personal...

19:28.735 --> 19:30.471
Now, shut your damn mouth.
(grunts)

19:30.471 --> 19:32.543
I can take care of myself.

19:32.543 --> 19:34.747
I never said you couldn't.
I mean, I‐I just figured that...

19:34.747 --> 19:37.620
Just what? Parachute your way
into Robbery‐Homicide

19:37.620 --> 19:39.691
after hot‐dogging
one drug case?

19:39.691 --> 19:41.962
Took me four long years.

19:41.962 --> 19:43.765
Why don't you book Romeo here.

19:44.868 --> 19:47.239
Bitch.

19:47.907 --> 19:49.510
(grunts)

19:49.510 --> 19:51.380
I'm just saying
what you thinking.

19:51.380 --> 19:52.516
(phone vibrating)

19:55.388 --> 19:57.492
Who's calling you, Boogie?

19:59.797 --> 20:02.402
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

20:03.104 --> 20:04.574
Bailey, what's up?

20:04.574 --> 20:06.678
Cruz found an address
text to Boogie's phone,

20:06.678 --> 20:09.918
and a 911 call just came in
on that same location‐‐ robbery.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.055
That's our crew.
What's the address?

20:12.055 --> 20:14.026
2604 South Gramercy.

20:14.026 --> 20:14.961
But there's more.

20:14.961 --> 20:17.432
The woman who called it in
is in the house.

20:17.432 --> 20:18.401
911 has her on the line.

20:18.401 --> 20:19.971
All right, patch us through.
(siren wailing)

20:19.971 --> 20:21.340
(phone beeps)

20:24.847 --> 20:26.050
(quietly):
Hello?

20:26.050 --> 20:28.154
Hey, this is Detective Riggs.

20:28.154 --> 20:29.891
Is it safe for you to talk?

20:29.891 --> 20:31.962
I think so, yes.

20:31.962 --> 20:33.765
Okay. What's your name?

20:33.765 --> 20:34.767
Haley.

20:34.767 --> 20:35.636
All right, Haley.

20:35.636 --> 20:37.506
Where are you
in the house right now?

20:37.506 --> 20:39.476
In the hallway closet.

20:39.476 --> 20:41.413
I can see out a little.
(men chattering)

20:41.413 --> 20:43.719
Okay, how many men
do you see in the house?

20:43.719 --> 20:45.923
HALEY:
I think four, wearing masks.

20:45.923 --> 20:48.996
They're going through
all the rooms.

20:48.996 --> 20:50.164
They're gonna find me.

20:50.164 --> 20:52.970
No, they're not. Listen,
we're almost there, okay?

20:52.970 --> 20:55.642
They went away.

20:55.642 --> 20:57.178
I can see the front door.

20:57.178 --> 20:58.882
It's so close.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.719
No, Haley.
You stay where you are

21:00.719 --> 21:02.455
in that closet.
Are you listening to me?

21:02.455 --> 21:03.959
I think I can make it.

21:03.959 --> 21:04.861
Haley, no.

21:04.861 --> 21:07.465
Haley? Haley!

21:14.012 --> 21:15.682
Haley?

21:17.085 --> 21:18.655
(gunshot)

21:18.655 --> 21:19.624
Drive.

21:19.624 --> 21:21.493
(engine revving, siren wailing)

21:41.033 --> 21:43.070
This case is now our top
priority. A young woman is dead,

21:43.070 --> 21:44.941
shot with a . 380, no
fingerprints found at the scene.

21:44.941 --> 21:47.245
This crew only hits
when no one is home.

21:47.245 --> 21:48.582
Haley surprised them.

21:48.582 --> 21:49.884
By the look of things,
she was asleep.

21:49.884 --> 21:52.122
Probably didn't hear them until
they were already in the house.

21:52.122 --> 21:54.994
Where are we on I. D.'ing Rajon
and Boogie's associates?

21:54.994 --> 21:56.931
I checked the gang database
and my CIs, but nothing.

21:56.931 --> 21:59.169
M‐Maybe there's something I‐I
could pull from the robberies

21:59.169 --> 22:01.774
that I...
I checked all the vics.
None of them have the same

22:01.774 --> 22:03.477
security companies,
gardeners, housekeepers.

22:03.477 --> 22:05.682
I even checked
the truck delivery routes.

22:05.682 --> 22:07.218
But this one does not
fit the profile

22:07.218 --> 22:09.055
of the other
robberies.

22:09.055 --> 22:10.224
Not only was
someone home,

22:10.224 --> 22:12.897
but they didn't have much.

22:12.897 --> 22:15.669
There's a link
that we're not seeing.

22:15.669 --> 22:18.742
NAOMI: My sister wasn't
supposed to be at my house.

22:18.742 --> 22:20.546
I didn't even know
she was in town.

22:20.546 --> 22:23.552
And‐and what did I have
to even steal?

22:23.552 --> 22:25.154
They killed her for...

22:25.154 --> 22:26.558
for some cheap jewelry

22:26.558 --> 22:28.862
and $70 in the
kitchen drawer?

22:30.666 --> 22:33.037
Look, we're gonna find
the people that did this,

22:33.037 --> 22:34.574
I promise you.

22:36.143 --> 22:39.015
(sighs)

22:39.015 --> 22:42.021
They said you were
on the phone with her,

22:42.021 --> 22:43.290
when she was hiding.

22:43.290 --> 22:45.562
I was.

22:48.602 --> 22:50.739
(exhales) She must have
been so scared.

22:52.275 --> 22:54.479
Actually, she was very brave.

22:55.682 --> 22:57.786
Yeah?
Yeah.

23:05.969 --> 23:09.009
Um...

23:09.009 --> 23:12.549
did anyone know about your plans
to be out tonight?

23:14.553 --> 23:16.658
Anyone have access
to your home?

23:21.033 --> 23:23.605
We lost our parents
when we were young.

23:23.605 --> 23:25.942
Haley was my best friend.

23:25.942 --> 23:28.782
The only family I have.

23:28.782 --> 23:31.153
Had.

23:31.153 --> 23:33.123
And now...

23:33.123 --> 23:34.894
she's gone.

23:34.894 --> 23:36.831
Just like that.

23:39.904 --> 23:41.841
Yeah.

23:46.684 --> 23:49.523
(phone ringing)

23:51.928 --> 23:53.063
What?

23:53.063 --> 23:53.965
ROGER JR.:
Riggs.

23:53.965 --> 23:56.938
I‐I'm glad you picked up.
It's RJ.

23:56.938 --> 23:58.207
I‐I need help.

23:58.207 --> 23:59.677
RJ? RJ who?

23:59.677 --> 24:00.846
Roger Junior.

24:00.846 --> 24:01.948
Your partner's son.

24:01.948 --> 24:04.754
Oh, RJ! Hey, buddy, what's up?

24:04.754 --> 24:08.093
Okay, well, um,
I snuck out to meet this girl

24:08.093 --> 24:09.329
and I got stranded in, like,

24:09.329 --> 24:11.734
not really
the best neighborhood.

24:11.734 --> 24:14.573
And... I‐I know it's a huge ask,

24:14.573 --> 24:15.942
but can you come get me?

24:15.942 --> 24:18.046
RJ, you got to
call your dad, buddy.

24:18.046 --> 24:19.884
I... Look, he just
left the station.

24:19.884 --> 24:22.923
Did you not hear what I said?
I snuck out.

24:23.992 --> 24:25.060
Riggs,

24:25.060 --> 24:27.699
please, I'm begging you.

24:30.806 --> 24:32.943
All right, where are you?

24:37.686 --> 24:39.088
(engine starts)

24:40.191 --> 24:41.727
(car alarm chirps)

24:45.100 --> 24:47.405
Ms. Abernathy.

24:47.405 --> 24:49.209
Hate to bother you
with more questions,

24:49.209 --> 24:52.315
but when you went out tonight,
did you take your car

24:52.315 --> 24:53.985
or did you leave that at home?

24:53.985 --> 24:55.221
I drove.

24:55.221 --> 24:58.093
I would, too.
I mean, it's a nice Tesla.

24:58.093 --> 25:00.130
I work for the dealership.

25:00.130 --> 25:03.036
One of the perks is getting
to drive an $80,000 car.

25:03.036 --> 25:04.807
I wouldn't be able
to afford it otherwise.

25:04.807 --> 25:07.679
Well, you drive safely.

25:18.835 --> 25:20.839
ROGER JR.:
<i>It's like cracking a case.</i>

25:20.839 --> 25:22.308
What's like cracking a case?

25:22.308 --> 25:26.651
Figuring out what a girl
wants to hear so they let you...

25:26.651 --> 25:28.955
you know, g‐get with them.

25:28.955 --> 25:29.957
Oh.

25:29.957 --> 25:31.259
You know,
this was like a...

25:31.259 --> 25:34.733
a serious,
X‐rated‐type situation.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.269
She was like, "Mmm,"
and then I was like, "Mmm,"

25:36.269 --> 25:38.708
and then she was like,
"I love you, RJ."
Okay, so you...

25:38.708 --> 25:40.277
you weren't with an actual girl.

25:40.277 --> 25:41.981
I mean, that
much is clear.

25:41.981 --> 25:44.052
All right, look,
but wherever you were,

25:44.052 --> 25:46.056
you're gonna have
to tell your parents.

25:46.056 --> 25:47.058
What? No, no, no.

25:47.058 --> 25:49.195
See, that's the whole reason
I called you.

25:49.195 --> 25:52.301
Mom and Dad treat me like
I'm a damn child or something...

25:52.301 --> 25:54.472
You <i>are</i> a child, RJ.

25:54.472 --> 25:57.178
Theirs.

25:57.178 --> 25:59.015
And you always will be.

25:59.015 --> 26:00.719
(sighs)

26:00.719 --> 26:02.154
You want to be treated
like an adult?

26:02.154 --> 26:04.158
Then start by being
straight up with them,

26:04.158 --> 26:06.964
and try to learn from
whatever their reaction is.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.237
Okay?

26:10.237 --> 26:11.774
I got it.

26:17.151 --> 26:18.888
Are you kidding?

26:18.888 --> 26:20.290
I don't have a desk.
I figured I'd crash here.

26:20.290 --> 26:22.028
Well, you can set up camp
in the break room

26:22.028 --> 26:24.032
or on the floor.
MURTAUGH:
The burglaries.

26:24.032 --> 26:27.204
Where were the owners
when their homes got hit?

26:27.204 --> 26:30.477
All over. Concerts, dinners,
games, gallery openings.

26:30.477 --> 26:32.448
All places that use valets.

26:32.448 --> 26:34.218
That's the link.

26:34.218 --> 26:37.726
The crew is not casing homes,
they're casing cars.

26:37.726 --> 26:39.328
Valet sees that they have
nice rides,

26:39.328 --> 26:41.399
figure they probably
have nice stuff back home.

26:41.399 --> 26:43.805
And that's how they messed up
on this last hit.

26:43.805 --> 26:44.973
Because the owner
had a sleek car,

26:44.973 --> 26:46.109
but they didn't have much stuff.

26:46.109 --> 26:47.144
BAILEY:
And they know where to hit

26:47.144 --> 26:49.182
because most people
have their home addresses

26:49.182 --> 26:50.885
on the car registration.

26:50.885 --> 26:52.789
Or their GPS. So then...

26:52.789 --> 26:54.325
Valet tells the
break‐in crew.

26:54.325 --> 26:56.429
Exactly. So, get the names

26:56.429 --> 26:58.868
of the valet companies
that our vics use.

26:58.868 --> 27:01.907
We find the valets,
we find the crew.

27:03.376 --> 27:04.780
Detective Murtaugh.

27:04.780 --> 27:05.915
Sergeant Collins.

27:05.915 --> 27:06.917
Had some paperwork
to file downstairs,

27:06.917 --> 27:08.921
thought I'd come up
and introduce myself.

27:08.921 --> 27:10.224
So, what can I do for you?

27:10.224 --> 27:11.326
I pulled over your son tonight.

27:11.326 --> 27:14.198
He and a buddy were in
a Porsche, doing 80 on Alameda.

27:14.198 --> 27:16.302
(chuckles):
That's not <i>my</i> son.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.041
No? His name was Roger Jr.

27:19.041 --> 27:20.979
He gave me your
badge number and card.

27:20.979 --> 27:23.885
I just thought
you'd want to know.

27:29.262 --> 27:30.497
I'm with him right now.

27:30.497 --> 27:33.170
Tell him I came to you and told
you everything, like an adult.

27:33.170 --> 27:36.376
No, I don't think we should send
him to military school. Yet.

27:36.376 --> 27:39.348
Yes, he was just getting to
the part where he got stranded

27:39.348 --> 27:41.452
after hanging out with Marcus.
MURTAUGH: Marcus?

27:41.452 --> 27:44.158
They got pulled over by
the police. Did RJ mention that?

27:44.158 --> 27:46.129
He did. He said he didn't
want to get in trouble,

27:46.129 --> 27:47.532
but didn't want
us to worry.

27:47.532 --> 27:49.268
(laughs): Which is why
he called Riggs

27:49.268 --> 27:49.970
for a ride home.

27:49.970 --> 27:52.843
Riggs? What? He called Riggs?

27:52.843 --> 27:55.480
Yes, Martin dropped him off...

27:55.480 --> 27:56.750
Call you back.

28:00.525 --> 28:02.361
Riggs.
Yo!

28:02.361 --> 28:03.531
Hey, I thought
you went home.

28:03.531 --> 28:05.802
Nah, I came back.
I cracked the case.

28:05.802 --> 28:07.438
What'd you figure out?

28:07.438 --> 28:08.808
What've you been doing?

28:08.808 --> 28:10.210
Oh, I just had to run an errand.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.981
An errand.
Like going to pick up

28:11.981 --> 28:14.887
my son after he got
pulled over by LAPD?

28:14.887 --> 28:16.991
(sighs)
Look, Roger, he...

28:16.991 --> 28:18.995
RJ called me and said
he went to go meet a girl...

28:18.995 --> 28:20.565
I don't care
what he said.

28:20.565 --> 28:22.101
You know why
RJ called you?

28:22.101 --> 28:24.372
Because you're
the fun uncle

28:24.372 --> 28:26.577
who likes to smokes weed,
and tell him and his sister...
Okay...

28:26.577 --> 28:29.248
...that it's okay to drink
because you don't give a damn!

28:29.248 --> 28:30.150
You need to calm down.

28:30.150 --> 28:32.388
Two black teenagers,
one of them my son,

28:32.388 --> 28:35.327
pulled over by
a uni I don't know!

28:35.327 --> 28:40.437
Do you have any idea
how bad that could've gone?

28:40.437 --> 28:42.174
No.

28:42.174 --> 28:46.182
Because you have nothing
to love in this world,

28:46.182 --> 28:47.852
but yourself.

28:51.192 --> 28:53.564
Nice.

28:53.564 --> 28:56.235
And you wonder why
your kids won't talk to you.

28:59.075 --> 29:02.147
Don't ever get involved
with my family again.

29:02.147 --> 29:03.316
Is that clear?

29:05.253 --> 29:06.991
Crystal.

29:08.594 --> 29:10.030
What?!

29:10.030 --> 29:12.134
Get back to work.

29:16.042 --> 29:17.545
MURTAUGH:
What's wrong with you, boy?

29:17.545 --> 29:19.181
Why didn't you call
me or your mother?

29:19.181 --> 29:20.083
Because you just
called me "boy."

29:20.083 --> 29:22.321
Oh, because you're
a man? Is that it?

29:24.225 --> 29:25.460
A man doesn't go for a joy ride,

29:25.460 --> 29:27.632
then wave his daddy's card
around to get out of trouble.

29:27.632 --> 29:29.936
And you better pray
that that car wasn't stolen.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.207
It wasn't.

29:32.207 --> 29:35.615
It... it belonged
to Marcus's friend at work.

29:35.615 --> 29:37.886
And Riggs didn't know.
He was just trying to help...

29:37.886 --> 29:39.121
Don't talk to
me about Riggs!

29:39.121 --> 29:42.962
What Inglewood teenager has
friends with rides like that?

29:42.962 --> 29:44.265
As far as I know,

29:44.265 --> 29:46.904
the only job Marcus has
is selling bootleg DVDs.

29:46.904 --> 29:50.010
He also valets for some fancy
restaurant in West Hollywood.

29:51.112 --> 29:52.515
He's a valet?

29:53.517 --> 29:55.287
Give me his number.

29:55.287 --> 29:57.391
(sighs)

30:09.583 --> 30:11.152
Hey.

30:11.152 --> 30:13.323
What's up?

30:13.323 --> 30:15.060
I got more addresses
if you need it.

30:15.060 --> 30:18.032
Good. 'Cause that last one
you gave us didn't work out.

30:18.032 --> 30:19.703
We got people waiting
on us to deliver,

30:19.703 --> 30:22.074
so you're gonna help
them make it right.

30:22.074 --> 30:24.445
(phone ringing)

30:24.445 --> 30:26.382
MARCUS:
What the...?

30:28.286 --> 30:29.623
"Detective"?

30:29.623 --> 30:31.092
You talk to the cops?

30:31.092 --> 30:33.463
It's not like that, bro,
all right? My...

30:34.465 --> 30:36.703
Let's go for a ride.

30:36.703 --> 30:38.373
(engine starts)

30:46.422 --> 30:48.092
Okay.

30:48.092 --> 30:50.030
Uh‐huh.

30:54.038 --> 30:56.209
I might have something,
but I hit a roadblock.

30:56.209 --> 30:57.512
Mind taking a look?

31:01.653 --> 31:04.425
All right. What you got?

31:04.425 --> 31:07.264
A girl I know works at
the city finance office.

31:07.264 --> 31:09.468
She says all the valet
stands we're looking at

31:09.468 --> 31:11.540
are owned by
a Showtime Industries,

31:11.540 --> 31:13.042
owned by William Sharman.

31:13.042 --> 31:15.146
But I can't find
any record of him.

31:15.146 --> 31:17.518
That's because
that name is bogus.

31:17.518 --> 31:18.587
Bill Sharman was

31:18.587 --> 31:21.627
the general manager
of the Showtime era Lakers.

31:24.298 --> 31:26.770
Come on. Responsible for Kareem?

31:26.770 --> 31:28.239
Magic?

31:28.239 --> 31:29.676
I'm a Galaxy guy.

31:29.676 --> 31:31.379
(sighs)

31:31.379 --> 31:33.149
Course you are.

31:33.149 --> 31:37.157
All right, well, let's find out
who William Sharman really is.

31:38.761 --> 31:40.698
(tires screech)

31:44.438 --> 31:47.712
Man, that detective that called,
that was just my friend's dad.

31:47.712 --> 31:50.283
Okay? It's nothing.
You got to believe me.

31:50.283 --> 31:51.853
We do believe you.

31:51.853 --> 31:53.824
That's why you're
coming on this job.

31:53.824 --> 31:54.826
On a job?

31:54.826 --> 31:56.596
Why? I wouldn't know what to do.

31:56.596 --> 31:58.433
All I been doing is
pulling addresses from cars,

31:58.433 --> 31:59.468
like you asked me.

31:59.468 --> 32:01.807
Congratulations.

32:01.807 --> 32:03.510
You've just been promoted.

32:08.587 --> 32:11.492
Son, I need to know when
exactly Marcus left here.

32:11.492 --> 32:12.995
I told you, I don't know.

32:23.449 --> 32:24.451
What are you doing here?

32:24.451 --> 32:26.422
Cruz and Bailey followed

32:26.422 --> 32:27.759
your lead on the valet stands.

32:27.759 --> 32:31.800
Turns out they're all owned by
one individual: Marshawn Wyley.

32:31.800 --> 32:32.602
The coach?

32:32.602 --> 32:34.839
Yeah. I had to put
a BOLO out on him.

32:34.839 --> 32:37.779
These kids are
too scared to talk.

32:37.779 --> 32:39.214
RJ's friend Marcus

32:39.214 --> 32:40.718
works this stand.

32:40.718 --> 32:42.789
He might be
caught up in this.

32:42.789 --> 32:45.126
I keep calling
his phone, but...

32:45.126 --> 32:46.128
(sighs)

32:46.128 --> 32:47.230
...nothing.

32:47.230 --> 32:50.336
Or maybe he already
told you that when, uh, you guys

32:50.336 --> 32:51.573
took your little ride together.

32:51.573 --> 32:53.276
Mm, Roger, honestly.

32:53.276 --> 32:54.278
(line ringing)

32:54.278 --> 32:55.413
I already said I was sorry.

32:55.413 --> 32:57.350
Sorry? I didn't hear sorry.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.620
Oh, maybe 'cause
you're just too busy

32:58.620 --> 33:00.323
punching me in the jaw.
(phone ringing)

33:00.323 --> 33:01.492
You hear that?

33:01.492 --> 33:03.564
Yeah.

33:17.859 --> 33:19.562
They got Marcus.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.606
All right, so we know you been
feeding addresses to your boss.

33:24.606 --> 33:28.179
Now, the first one of you
who tells us where

33:28.179 --> 33:31.285
Wyley is right now
gets a free pass.

33:36.596 --> 33:39.334
Nothing.

33:39.334 --> 33:40.771
All right.

33:40.771 --> 33:42.642
Take them in.

33:45.748 --> 33:47.718
Hold up just a second.

33:47.718 --> 33:49.421
You know, it's Friday.

33:49.421 --> 33:51.793
So that means your pals...
you guys are gonna be

33:51.793 --> 33:52.895
in County
the whole weekend.

33:52.895 --> 33:55.266
Fresh meat, baby face‐‐
they're gonna like you.

33:55.266 --> 33:56.268
Big chest.
That's true.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.672
You do... you do
have a big chest.

33:57.672 --> 33:58.607
You do work out a lot.

33:58.607 --> 34:00.276
They love that.
You need to...
Yeah.

34:00.276 --> 34:01.145
...make sure you choose
your partner though.

34:01.145 --> 34:02.247
Right.
Don't let them
choose you.

34:02.247 --> 34:03.750
That's when it gets scary.
All right, all right.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.221
The... a couple pulled up
in a nice ride.

34:06.221 --> 34:07.892
I heard them say
they were celebrating,

34:07.892 --> 34:12.935
so I gave their address to
Mr. Wyley when he took Marcus.

34:12.935 --> 34:14.304
Here.

34:17.243 --> 34:18.780
They're taking him
on a job.

34:18.780 --> 34:19.749
Let's go.

34:21.620 --> 34:23.624
Go, man.
Come on, let's go.

34:23.624 --> 34:27.665
Do exactly as I tell you,
and there won't be any trouble.

34:29.836 --> 34:31.840
Come on, come on,
let's go, let's go.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.342
Put it all in there.

34:35.446 --> 34:37.283
(keys jingle, lock clicks)

34:37.283 --> 34:39.388
(man and woman laughing)

34:41.559 --> 34:42.695
Shh.

34:44.932 --> 34:46.235
Oh.

34:46.235 --> 34:49.609
Definitely a good idea
to Uber home.

34:49.609 --> 34:52.581
I think I had three too many.

34:52.581 --> 34:53.850
(grunts)

34:53.850 --> 34:56.589
(screaming)

34:58.894 --> 35:00.063

35:00.063 --> 35:02.568
MURTAUGH: <i>Send backup</i>
<i>to 622 Nicada Drive.</i>

35:02.568 --> 35:05.440
<i>Suspects armed and dangerous.</i>

35:08.947 --> 35:11.218
MARCUS:
Kill them?

35:11.218 --> 35:12.688
Why? No reason.

35:15.226 --> 35:16.863
Now there is.

35:16.863 --> 35:18.700
If they live,
they can I. D. us,

35:18.700 --> 35:20.504
send you away for life.

35:20.504 --> 35:22.975
So, it's either
you or them.

35:22.975 --> 35:24.946
Or...

35:24.946 --> 35:25.948
you...

35:25.948 --> 35:28.787
and them.

35:28.787 --> 35:30.456
Your choice.

35:32.962 --> 35:35.299
(muffled grunting)

35:36.736 --> 35:37.738
(muffled groaning)

35:48.894 --> 35:50.764
Marcus, come back here.

35:54.739 --> 35:55.908
(grunting)

35:59.949 --> 36:01.886
A . 380?

36:03.389 --> 36:05.293
You the one
that killed Haley?
Who?

36:07.463 --> 36:09.367
Put that gun
down, Marcus!

36:09.367 --> 36:11.506
Look, I didn't want any of this,
all right?

36:11.506 --> 36:12.775
They made me do it!

36:12.775 --> 36:14.879
I believe you. I do.

36:14.879 --> 36:16.348
You think I'm stupid?!

36:16.348 --> 36:17.651
Second I put this gun down,

36:17.651 --> 36:19.589
the only thing that comes
next for me is jail.

36:19.589 --> 36:20.624
I'm not going to jail!

36:20.624 --> 36:24.030
I've known you since, what?!

36:24.030 --> 36:26.970
First grade.

36:26.970 --> 36:28.607
Now, you can trust me, Marcus.

36:29.809 --> 36:31.813
And I can trust you.

36:31.813 --> 36:33.917
I know I can.

36:35.954 --> 36:37.658
Now, there's a way out of this.

36:39.060 --> 36:41.064
You make a deal.

36:41.064 --> 36:42.467
I vouch for you.

36:43.803 --> 36:45.908
And you can still
have a life, son.

36:48.078 --> 36:50.517
Just put that weapon down.

36:51.819 --> 36:54.491
Just put that
weapon down, son.

37:01.438 --> 37:02.373
Rog!

37:02.373 --> 37:03.375
(grunts)

37:03.977 --> 37:05.346
(grunts)

37:07.851 --> 37:09.889
Get your ass down!

37:11.391 --> 37:14.064
(groans)

37:14.064 --> 37:15.934
I was dropping the gun.
You saw me.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.405
I saw, Marcus, I saw.

37:18.405 --> 37:19.942
(sirens approaching)

37:19.942 --> 37:20.777
It's okay.

37:23.817 --> 37:25.954
(monitor beeping steadily)

37:33.737 --> 37:36.074
He wanted to see
his friend.

37:38.847 --> 37:40.917
He lost a lot of blood,

37:40.917 --> 37:42.120
but he's stable now.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.857
Doctors said
he'll pull through fine.

37:43.857 --> 37:47.497
Dad, um... look, I...

37:47.497 --> 37:50.570
I know I messed up,
but I want you and Mom to know

37:50.570 --> 37:52.941
that's‐that's not the
man I'm trying to be.

37:55.981 --> 37:59.020
(sighs)

38:06.368 --> 38:09.809
One inch to the left,
and he would've been dead.

38:09.809 --> 38:15.587
I can't stop thinking that that
very easily could've been RJ.

38:15.587 --> 38:18.392
I'm always on him
about the old neighborhood.

38:18.392 --> 38:19.862
It's because of me

38:19.862 --> 38:21.732
he was with Marcus.

38:21.732 --> 38:25.106
Bad things happen
in every neighborhood.

38:25.106 --> 38:28.445
We've got good kids.

38:28.445 --> 38:31.652
They've got good parents.

38:31.652 --> 38:33.623

38:35.894 --> 38:38.031
(elevator bell dings)

38:49.053 --> 38:51.391
(elevator bell dings)

39:02.748 --> 39:04.885
So, congratulations on taking
down the home invasion crew,

39:04.885 --> 39:08.492
solving a murder and stopping
what could have been two more.

39:10.597 --> 39:12.668
You know, as much as
I enjoy you both sitting there

39:12.668 --> 39:15.540
with your mouths shut,
you two need to bury the hatchet

39:15.540 --> 39:16.909
and‐‐ I can't believe
I'm saying this‐‐

39:16.909 --> 39:21.151
get back to being your usual
pain‐in‐the‐ass selves.

39:21.151 --> 39:24.825
Riggs, apologize to Murtaugh
for not telling him

39:24.825 --> 39:25.894
about RJ calling you.

39:25.894 --> 39:26.929
I already did.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.065
Barely.

39:28.065 --> 39:31.772
Murtaugh, tell Riggs
you're sorry for clocking him.

39:34.678 --> 39:36.682
You know what, then?

39:36.682 --> 39:37.951
New assignment.

39:37.951 --> 39:40.590
You're gonna hate it.

39:42.493 --> 39:44.030
Who wants to start?

39:46.034 --> 39:47.169
Okay.

39:47.169 --> 39:48.606
I'll start.

39:48.606 --> 39:50.610
You're both not the easiest
of individuals

39:50.610 --> 39:52.079
to get along with.
Both?
Both?

39:52.079 --> 39:53.215
What?
I never said
that I was easy.

39:53.215 --> 39:56.522
He's crazier than
a sack of cats.

39:56.522 --> 39:57.958
Did you say I was
crazier than a sack of cats?

39:57.958 --> 40:02.099
Funky, feral and confused‐‐
that's you.

40:02.099 --> 40:04.538
CAHILL: I think what Roger
is trying to say

40:04.538 --> 40:06.007
is that your behavior
since you two

40:06.007 --> 40:07.143
started working together
has been

40:07.143 --> 40:08.913
erratic

40:08.913 --> 40:10.684
and impulsive.
Yes.

40:10.684 --> 40:11.318
How about this?

40:11.318 --> 40:12.821
He punched me in the face

40:12.821 --> 40:13.656
and cracked two teeth.

40:13.656 --> 40:15.560
How's that for erratic
and impulsive?

40:15.560 --> 40:20.269
And what Martin is trying to say
is that he was genuinely...

40:20.269 --> 40:22.541
hurt... by you.

40:28.218 --> 40:29.788
I really cracked two teeth?

40:31.692 --> 40:34.197
Guess I don't know
my own strength.

40:34.197 --> 40:35.767
These here are some lethal...

40:35.767 --> 40:37.136
I should've

40:37.136 --> 40:39.207
called you right after
RJ called me.

40:39.207 --> 40:40.877
All right? So, I'm sorry.

40:42.681 --> 40:43.916
I am.

40:43.916 --> 40:45.920
I know you're the only guy
around here who has my back

40:45.920 --> 40:47.958
and... I appreciate that.

40:47.958 --> 40:49.561
And I appreciate that.

40:50.830 --> 40:53.335
And you.

40:53.335 --> 40:54.872
Sometimes.

40:54.872 --> 40:56.575
Occasionally.

40:58.278 --> 41:00.817
That's a great first step.

41:02.420 --> 41:05.593
Martin, is there something
you could do to help

41:05.593 --> 41:06.729
nurture this relationship?

41:09.200 --> 41:11.304
Uh...

41:14.010 --> 41:17.818
This is not easy for one man
to say to another...

41:19.253 --> 41:22.828
... but your head is
wonderfully round.

41:22.828 --> 41:25.265
Bald is beautiful.

41:27.136 --> 41:29.140
Sometimes...

41:29.140 --> 41:31.244
at sunset...

41:31.244 --> 41:34.250
or when it's
slightly dark out,

41:34.250 --> 41:37.256
your mustache almost
looks not ridiculous.

41:37.256 --> 41:39.595
Thank you.
Sometimes.

41:40.295 --> 41:41.866
Okay.

41:41.866 --> 41:42.868
Out, both of you, now.

41:42.868 --> 41:43.803
All right.
See you later.

41:43.803 --> 41:46.207
("Back in Love Again"
by L. T. D. playing)

41:48.011 --> 41:49.146
Hook him up, Art.

41:49.146 --> 41:50.282
Oh, I can work magic,

41:50.282 --> 41:51.785
but not miracles.

41:51.785 --> 41:53.154
What kind of look
was you going for?

41:53.154 --> 41:54.691
Mid‐'80s Selleck.

41:54.691 --> 41:55.994
I was thinking of
mid‐'70s porn.

41:55.994 --> 41:57.429
RIGGS: Or we can just
skip the cut entirely.

41:57.429 --> 42:00.035
Look, I came down here in
search of a decent meal.

42:00.035 --> 42:01.906
This guys wants
to eat tofu burgers

42:01.906 --> 42:03.743
and quinoa salads
all day long.
Oh.

42:03.743 --> 42:05.178
(laughter)

42:05.178 --> 42:06.180
Now, now, you know,

42:06.180 --> 42:07.249
you can take the boy

42:07.249 --> 42:08.218
out of Sherman Oaks,

42:08.218 --> 42:10.355
but you can't take
Sherman Oaks out the boy.

42:10.355 --> 42:11.224
(laughter)

42:11.224 --> 42:13.328
Hey, look, I had
a heart attack, people.

42:13.328 --> 42:14.731
Just cut his damn hair.

42:14.731 --> 42:15.867
And give him my discount.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.136
Oh, you want me
to overcharge him?

42:17.136 --> 42:18.038
(laughter)

42:18.038 --> 42:20.375
Come on, Art,
don't embarrass me, man.

42:20.375 --> 42:22.614
He's‐he's like family.

42:25.052 --> 42:28.024
Hey, did Rog tell you guys
he's on a juice cleanse?
ART:
What?

42:28.024 --> 42:29.695
I mean, look, you can't be
in the vehicle longer

42:29.695 --> 42:31.164
than five minutes
with the fella, but look at him.

42:31.164 --> 42:32.166
He looks good, doesn't he?

42:32.166 --> 42:33.435
Got a glow
to his skin.

42:33.435 --> 42:36.107
Hey, did he tell you about the
situation he had up in his face?

42:36.107 --> 42:38.011
We're not talking
about the situation

42:38.011 --> 42:39.246
with civilians, all right?
