00:39.474 --> 00:41.780
There.
You ready to do this thing?

00:41.824 --> 00:43.521
I just need a minute.

00:43.565 --> 00:46.176
Okay. Take your time.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.615
Glenn, wait.

00:50.659 --> 00:51.964
You have the rings?

00:55.577 --> 00:57.187
Oh, my God!
I knew I forgot something.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.799
Seriously?

01:00.843 --> 01:03.280
You think I'd let my big brother
down on his wedding day?

01:03.324 --> 01:04.890
Come on.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.153
I'll see you at the guillotine.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.806
Oh, altar.
I mean altar.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.338
Come in.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.907
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're gathered here today

02:04.950 --> 02:07.388
on this joyous occasion
to join George and Helena

02:07.431 --> 02:10.042
in the bond of holy matrimony.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.741
Oh. You okay, George?

02:12.784 --> 02:14.482
Yeah.

02:17.354 --> 02:18.790
Do you, George Carr,

02:18.834 --> 02:22.838
take Helena Clark to be
your lawful wedded wife,

02:22.881 --> 02:25.928
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

02:25.971 --> 02:29.192
For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

02:29.236 --> 02:31.760
in sickness and in health,

02:31.803 --> 02:34.023
until death do you part?

02:37.505 --> 02:38.854
I...

02:38.897 --> 02:41.248
George?
What's wrong?

02:43.424 --> 02:44.599
George!
Oh, my God!

02:44.642 --> 02:47.297
George!
Oh, my God, George!

02:47.341 --> 02:49.212
I'll get some water!
George! George!

02:49.256 --> 02:50.735
Can somebody call 911?

02:50.779 --> 02:52.607
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

02:52.650 --> 02:53.869
George!

02:53.912 --> 02:55.131
Hang on, buddy!
George!

02:55.175 --> 02:56.306
I'll get you some help!

02:59.135 --> 03:00.702
Liar.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.966
Cupcake...

03:04.009 --> 03:05.924
That's right, George.

03:05.968 --> 03:08.884
Your little cupcake
is right here.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.929
I hope it wasn't
too sweet for you.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.411
Hey.

03:57.454 --> 04:00.109
You Rebecca Dillon?

04:00.152 --> 04:01.676
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.025
What's the trouble?

04:03.068 --> 04:05.157
Oh, flat tire,
passenger rear side.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.426
This is a rental car?
Yeah.

04:12.469 --> 04:14.210
You here for a visit?

04:14.254 --> 04:16.298
Oh, no.
No, I'm here for a wedding.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.084
Oh, getting married, huh?

04:19.128 --> 04:21.696
No. Tried that once.

04:21.738 --> 04:23.741
Didn't work out so well.

04:23.785 --> 04:27.658
Oh. Sorry, ma'am.
I didn't mean anything by it.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.486
It's my brother
who's getting married.

04:29.530 --> 04:34.622
Well, great, miss.
He must be a very lucky guy.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.886
Luckier than me, I hope.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.324
You ready to fix that flat?

04:41.368 --> 04:43.108
Have you back
on the road in no time.

04:43.152 --> 04:44.545
Thank you, sir.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.824
Somebody looks busy.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.304
Just a minute!

05:06.697 --> 05:08.046
Hi, honey!

05:10.266 --> 05:12.137
You leave work early?

05:12.181 --> 05:14.009
Yeah. Dad's gonna
close up the shop.

05:14.052 --> 05:16.098
But I just had to come see
you before I headed home.

05:16.141 --> 05:19.493
Oh, I love your
little surprises.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.973
You've got me wrapped
around your little finger.

05:22.017 --> 05:24.715
Well, not until
the second ring is placed.

05:27.675 --> 05:30.286
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, David.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.897
Oh, David, she needs that
delivered no later than 4:00.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.595
Four?
Mm-hmm.

05:34.638 --> 05:37.206
No problem.
Thank you.

05:37.249 --> 05:38.773
We've got a big party order.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.165
Three dozen chocolate
croissants.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.210
My best client.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.733
Everybody loves your work.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.348
What's wrong?

05:48.391 --> 05:50.175
Nothing.

05:50.219 --> 05:52.482
I guess I'm just a little
nervous about tonight.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.397
I really hope your sister
approves of me.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.573
I can't wait to get to know her.

05:56.617 --> 05:58.749
Honey, you've got nothing
to be nervous about.

05:58.793 --> 06:00.925
Becca is going to love you.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.753
I hope so.

06:09.238 --> 06:12.415
Ooh, now that's a pretty one.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.330
I always did like roses
at a wedding.

06:17.855 --> 06:20.554
Oh, that must be
Charlie and Helena.

06:20.597 --> 06:23.121
Just in time to pick out
the floral arrangement.

06:25.602 --> 06:28.083
Oh, I'm so glad that you're...

06:28.126 --> 06:30.781
Oh, Becca.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.653
Why do you always look
so disappointed to see me?

06:32.696 --> 06:35.264
No.
She's not.

06:35.307 --> 06:37.962
Now give your dad a big hug.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.442
Aw...
Oh...

06:41.096 --> 06:43.359
I'm sorry.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.535
It's just that I thought you
were coming tomorrow, the 5th.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.450
Today is the 5th, Mom.

06:47.494 --> 06:50.627
Oh, I'm afraid
I'm losing track of time

06:50.671 --> 06:52.542
preparing for this wedding.

06:52.586 --> 06:53.891
Here, let me get that.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.240
Oh, I can take it upstairs.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.025
Oh, no, Becca,
you're not upstairs.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.418
Your brother is
in your old room.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.245
Isn't he staying with Helena?

07:00.289 --> 07:02.509
No. She doesn't believe
that they should live together

07:02.552 --> 07:03.901
until after the wedding.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.077
Are you kidding?

07:06.121 --> 07:09.951
Okay, so why isn't Charlie
staying in his old room?

07:09.994 --> 07:11.474
Well, because after you left,

07:11.518 --> 07:13.824
he wanted the bigger room,
your room.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.652
So where am I?

07:15.696 --> 07:18.350
I turned my old office
into a guest room.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.222
Oh!

07:20.265 --> 07:23.312
Honey, I'm glad you're here.
I really am.

07:23.355 --> 07:27.229
It's just that I hate
to see you on your own again.

07:27.272 --> 07:29.274
Marriages fail
all the time, Mom.

07:29.318 --> 07:30.928
Well, not all of them.

07:30.972 --> 07:34.366
Please, girls,
can we drop this subject

07:34.410 --> 07:35.933
for just this one week?

07:35.977 --> 07:37.848
Mm-hmm.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.763
I just want everybody
to be happy.

07:39.807 --> 07:42.331
You know me.

07:42.374 --> 07:43.550
How was your trip?

07:43.593 --> 07:44.899
Good.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.988
Except I had a flat tire
on the way up.

07:47.031 --> 07:48.119
That was fun.

07:56.998 --> 07:57.955
Now don't be nervous.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.001
I can't help it.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.045
Hey, we can always ditch dinner

08:01.089 --> 08:02.090
and drive to Niagara Falls.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.222
Not on your life, mister!

08:04.266 --> 08:05.833
What would your sister think?

08:05.876 --> 08:08.966
No, this wedding's
going to be perfect.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.838
Well, nothing is ever perfect.

08:10.881 --> 08:13.275
I beg to disagree.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.150
Now how do I look?

08:19.194 --> 08:21.326
I want to make a good
impression on Becca.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.894
Oh, trust me.
She'll be impressed.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.417
Ready?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.249
Hey, Mom!
We're here!

08:36.907 --> 08:41.085
Oh, right on time!

08:41.129 --> 08:42.304
Let me take your coat, dear.

08:42.347 --> 08:43.260
Oh, thank you, Nancy.

08:43.304 --> 08:45.525
What a pretty dress.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.182
Rebecca?

08:51.226 --> 08:52.314
Helena?

08:59.103 --> 09:01.845
Sorry. I've just always
wanted a sister.

09:01.889 --> 09:04.674
Charlie's already told me
so much about you.

09:04.718 --> 09:07.764
But now that I've met you,
I just must know everything,

09:07.808 --> 09:09.679
every single thing.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.986
Well, be careful
what you wish for.

09:12.029 --> 09:13.988
I might just talk your ear off.

09:14.031 --> 09:15.859
Oh, I hope so.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.600
Nancy, can I help you
with anything?

09:17.644 --> 09:19.297
Yes, of course.
Thank you.

09:19.341 --> 09:21.386
Of course.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.475
Well?

09:23.519 --> 09:27.088
She's affectionate...
and strong.

09:27.131 --> 09:29.220
I think you're gonna
like her a lot.

09:29.264 --> 09:32.876
"I simply must know everything
about you, every single thing."

09:32.920 --> 09:33.790
Would you just stop it?

09:38.926 --> 09:41.058
You'd think with a
computer genius in the family,

09:41.102 --> 09:43.844
I'd be able to attach
something to an email.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.717
I've showed you
a million times, Dad.

09:47.761 --> 09:50.764
You know, I think all of these
computers are ruining the world.

09:50.807 --> 09:53.462
Well, basically,
I've been living in L.A.

09:53.505 --> 09:54.811
the past few years.

09:54.855 --> 09:56.770
Designing websites,
I.T. stuff.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.815
That's right.
Charlie's been telling me.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.643
So interesting.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.819
You know, Helena does
most of her work on-line.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.212
It keeps the cost
of overhead down.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.909
That's right.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.651
Becca, maybe you could
help me update my website.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.001
It's called
"Helena's Desserts by Design".

10:11.045 --> 10:14.135
Well.
Helena is a world-class baker.

10:14.178 --> 10:17.312
Cookies, breads,
cupcakes and pies.

10:17.355 --> 10:21.229
I've tried them all
and I've gained 10 pounds.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.667
Quit it, all of you.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.322
Oh, look, she's turning the
color of her red velvet cake.

10:27.365 --> 10:30.238
Oh, Charlie.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.936
Tell Rebecca how you two met.

10:32.980 --> 10:36.287
Yeah, let's hear about
this whirlwind romance, yeah.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.333
Whirlwind?

10:38.376 --> 10:40.640
Well, it did happen fast.

10:40.683 --> 10:43.643
I guess it did.

10:43.686 --> 10:48.082
Well, I moved into town about
five months ago from Amherst,

10:48.125 --> 10:50.998
and I felt that it
was time to start over.

10:51.041 --> 10:54.697
So when I was promoting samples
of my baked goods around town,

10:54.741 --> 10:57.091
I stopped into
the hardware store

10:57.134 --> 10:58.614
where I met your brother.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.835
Somehow I just knew
he was the one.

11:01.878 --> 11:06.100
And as soon as I tried her
desserts, I knew it too.

11:06.143 --> 11:08.842
Oh. So it was love
at first bite.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.887
Touché.

11:10.931 --> 11:13.585
You're lucky, Charlie.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.500
None of your other girlfriends
could even boil water.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.593
Oh!

11:21.637 --> 11:23.334
Look at what I just did.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.467
Oh, don't worry.
It's just water.

11:25.510 --> 11:28.557
Excuse me.
I'm gonna go clean up.

11:34.302 --> 11:38.306
Darling, why don't we bring
in Helena's dessert, okay?

11:42.571 --> 11:43.572
Here you go.
Thanks, Mom.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.452
Hey, go easy about
my ex-girlfriends

11:54.496 --> 11:56.237
around Helena, okay?

11:56.280 --> 11:59.109
Sorry.
It was just a joke.

12:03.810 --> 12:07.204
They were making fun
of you, all of them.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.772
You don't belong here.

12:09.816 --> 12:13.689
Yes, I do.
I just have to try harder.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.431
I can win them over.
I know I can.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.607
Charlie loves me.

12:18.650 --> 12:22.002
He does.
I know he does.

12:22.045 --> 12:26.049
Rebecca's jealous.
She hates you.

12:26.093 --> 12:30.271
She just doesn't know
me yet, but she will.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.708
Don't you ruin this for me.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.144
Not like last time.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.850
You know, Helena
was an orphan, too.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.721
Her adopted family
didn't treat her too well

12:45.765 --> 12:49.377
and yet she turned out to be a
smart and resourceful woman.

12:49.420 --> 12:53.163
I am sure she has
many great qualities.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.252
I guess I'm just ready
to settle down

12:55.296 --> 12:56.863
with somebody who has
the same values as me

12:56.906 --> 12:58.212
when it comes to love
and marriage.

12:58.255 --> 13:01.650
I'm happy for you, Charlie.

13:01.693 --> 13:04.000
You're lucky you finally
found someone you love.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.398
Hey, all cleaned up?

13:10.441 --> 13:12.008
All better.

13:14.489 --> 13:17.057
Helena, you are
spoiling us rotten!

13:17.100 --> 13:21.104
Oh, nonsense.
Thank you.

13:21.148 --> 13:24.629
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to win you guys over.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.415
See, my life really changed
the day that I met Charlie.

13:27.458 --> 13:30.940
And you, Nancy and Stuart.

13:30.984 --> 13:34.683
Now my new sister, Becca.

13:36.076 --> 13:39.035
Oh, that'll be
Mrs. Mazurek.

13:39.079 --> 13:41.821
She runs Mazurek's Bakery.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.605
I think she brought us
some samples to try.

13:43.648 --> 13:46.782
Oh!

13:46.826 --> 13:50.917
Is there something
wrong with my baking?

13:50.960 --> 13:53.702
No, it's not for dessert.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.443
We were just thinking
about who might provide

13:55.486 --> 13:57.401
the cake for the wedding.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.055
Oh.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.454
I'm just so glad you could come.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.630
They're beautiful.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.501
Oh, good evening, everyone.

14:10.545 --> 14:13.504
I'm sure you'll enjoy
these a lot more

14:13.548 --> 14:15.898
than some store-bought cupcakes.

14:15.942 --> 14:21.164
These aren't store-bought.
I baked them myself.

14:21.208 --> 14:24.864
Ellen, this is
Charlie's fiancé, Helena.

14:24.907 --> 14:28.215
And Helena owns
Helena's Desserts by Design.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.521
Oh, nice to finally meet you.

14:30.565 --> 14:34.090
I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't realize.

14:34.134 --> 14:36.658
I have my own business,
but it's alright.

14:36.701 --> 14:39.704
Haven't we met before?

14:39.748 --> 14:41.924
No, I don't believe so.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.535
Are you sure?
Your hair is different.

14:44.579 --> 14:49.018
But I'm almost certain
we met last year

14:49.062 --> 14:52.500
at the Toronto Bakeoff.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.676
I've never been to Toronto.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.766
Helena just moved here.
From Washington State.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.246
And you opened a bakery.

14:59.289 --> 15:02.510
We deliver locally and
have some online sales.

15:02.553 --> 15:06.383
How wonderful.
Mind if I try one?

15:06.427 --> 15:11.127
We won't be needing any
of your cakes, Mrs. Mazurek.

15:11.171 --> 15:14.043
I'm going to be handling all of
the desserts for the reception.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.045
Right, Charlie?

15:16.089 --> 15:18.395
Oh...

15:18.439 --> 15:20.484
We thought that you would
have something better

15:20.528 --> 15:23.226
to do than to bake
for the reception

15:23.270 --> 15:25.576
and Ellen just offered to help.

15:25.620 --> 15:29.493
That's very sweet, but I don't
need your help, Mrs. Mazurek.

15:29.537 --> 15:32.496
I enjoy baking and
I'm damn good at it.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.237
Excuse me.

15:36.457 --> 15:39.286
I'll go check on Helena.

15:39.329 --> 15:40.678
Ellen, I'm so sorry.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.593
I really don't know what to say.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.856
But you know what brides are
like before the wedding day.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.788
Are you okay?

16:03.832 --> 16:06.139
Of course.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.793
I have to apologize.

16:08.837 --> 16:11.666
I overreacted horribly.

16:11.709 --> 16:15.017
It's just, you know,
when you put a lot of effort

16:15.061 --> 16:17.846
into something and someone
comes along and insults you...

16:20.283 --> 16:22.111
So you've never met
Mrs. Mazurek before?

16:24.548 --> 16:27.508
No. She was mistaken.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.510
I thought you said earlier
you were from Amherst.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.686
I am.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.035
But you just told
Mrs. Mazurek you moved here

16:33.079 --> 16:34.819
from Washington State.

16:34.863 --> 16:37.344
I'm originally
from Washington State.

16:37.387 --> 16:41.043
I lived briefly in Amherst
before coming here.

16:41.087 --> 16:44.177
I've traveled a lot over the
years, Becca, just like you.

16:46.614 --> 16:49.530
Okay.

16:49.573 --> 16:51.184
As long as you're all right.

16:51.227 --> 16:52.837
Thank you.

17:09.984 --> 17:13.380
Charlie, I feel terrible after
treating Mrs. Mazurek that way.

17:13.423 --> 17:15.251
Honey, you're under a
lot of stress right now.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.297
You've got nothing
to worry about.

17:17.339 --> 17:18.646
I know, but I really
want Becca to like me,

17:18.689 --> 17:20.039
and I feel like I just blew it.

17:20.082 --> 17:23.954
Stop worrying.
It's gonna be all right.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.957
I'm gonna miss you tonight.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.089
I'm gonna miss you, too.

17:28.134 --> 17:31.180
I love you.
I love you, too.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.795
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

18:22.884 --> 18:27.323
Oh, there you are.
Mrs. Helena Clark.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.166
Hello?

18:44.210 --> 18:46.125
Nancy?
No, it's Becca.

18:46.168 --> 18:47.952
My mom's gone to bed.

18:47.996 --> 18:51.652
Oh. It's Mrs. Mazurek.
Is Helena still there?

18:51.695 --> 18:53.349
No, she left.

18:53.393 --> 18:54.655
Do you want me
to leave a message?

18:54.698 --> 18:56.483
No, no.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.572
How much do you know
about Helena?

18:58.615 --> 19:01.575
Not much.
I just met her tonight.

19:01.618 --> 19:03.272
My brother would be
the one to ask.

19:05.883 --> 19:09.626
Well, I don't want to butt
in where I don't belong,

19:09.670 --> 19:12.673
but I was trying
to find her online,

19:12.716 --> 19:15.763
and I remembered that
I had a program

19:15.806 --> 19:17.373
and I actually found...

19:22.465 --> 19:26.077
Oh, I'll call you back.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.218
Hi, Mrs. Mazurek.

19:36.262 --> 19:40.788
I am so sorry.
I owe you an apology.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.051
I was completely out of line.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.619
And you never got to
try one of my cupcakes.

19:45.662 --> 19:48.012
A peace offering?

19:48.056 --> 19:50.319
Oh, why, thank you, Helena.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.929
But this really isn't necessary.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.714
Oh, but it is.

19:53.757 --> 19:57.370
I behaved so badly
and I am so ashamed.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.981
I've just been really stressed
about the wedding.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.722
I hope you can understand.

20:01.765 --> 20:04.246
Please try it.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.902
Maybe later, but thank you.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.822
What a lovely little bake shop.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.262
I can't believe I haven't
been in here before.

20:20.306 --> 20:23.483
And you bake
everything in-house?

20:23.526 --> 20:26.573
Oh, not everything.
We carry a few brand names.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.329
Such intricate detail.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.209
Oh, those are beautiful.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.473
Huh.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.348
You know, I've been
thinking about

21:02.391 --> 21:04.611
what to put on the top
of my wedding cake.

21:04.654 --> 21:07.614
Oh, the figurines?

21:07.657 --> 21:10.356
I've collected them from
all over the world.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.532
They're very pretty.

21:12.575 --> 21:15.578
The one bride even
looks a bit like you.

21:15.622 --> 21:18.320
You think so?

21:18.364 --> 21:20.670
Would you mind
getting it down for me?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.542
I'd love to see it.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.066
Uh, of course.

21:31.464 --> 21:33.292
Be careful.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.217
Are these the ones you like?

21:50.396 --> 21:51.962
They're perfect.

21:56.837 --> 21:59.013
I tried to play nice.

21:59.056 --> 22:02.408
But you just couldn't
leave well enough alone.

22:02.451 --> 22:06.237
No one gets in the way
of my happiness!

22:18.162 --> 22:21.296
Hey.
Hey.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.906
All right, I know
what's you're gonna say.

22:22.950 --> 22:27.563
Yes, Helena can get
a bit emotional.

22:27.607 --> 22:29.130
But you gotta give her a break.

22:29.173 --> 22:31.915
We're all on edge here,
including me.

22:31.959 --> 22:34.004
Weddings aren't easy.

22:34.048 --> 22:37.094
I know.
I've been through it too.

22:37.138 --> 22:39.488
Look, I'm not here to compare
what you and Helena

22:39.532 --> 22:41.360
have to what Doug and I had.

22:41.403 --> 22:42.578
All marriages are different.

22:42.622 --> 22:44.232
Nothing's perfect.

22:44.275 --> 22:45.799
I just want to make
sure you're not

22:45.842 --> 22:46.974
rushing into anything.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.411
Trust me, this feels right.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.761
How much do you really
know about her, Charlie?

22:51.805 --> 22:53.372
Because I just got
a phone call from...

22:53.415 --> 22:55.243
I know enough, Becca.

22:55.286 --> 22:58.115
She's a good person
with strong morals.

22:58.159 --> 23:01.423
Mom and Dad love her
and I love her.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.469
I was hoping you would, too.

23:03.512 --> 23:06.080
Okay, fine.

23:06.123 --> 23:08.387
Tell me more about her
life before she met you.

23:08.430 --> 23:11.128
Helena doesn't really
talk about the past.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.609
She only looks forward.

23:13.653 --> 23:16.307
And I happen to think that's a
very positive outlook on life.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.484
It is if you're
hiding something!

23:20.355 --> 23:23.097
Okay.
Goodnight, Becca.

23:27.754 --> 23:29.669
What's with all the keys?

23:31.497 --> 23:33.977
Oh, Helena wanted an extra set.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.588
I made them for her at the shop.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.894
I just keep forgetting
to give them to her.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.246
I missed you.

23:42.290 --> 23:43.596
I missed you, too.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.630
What happened?
Someone hurt?

24:17.673 --> 24:19.066
I don't know.

24:32.732 --> 24:35.604
Rebecca?
Helena? Hi.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.258
What are you doing here?

24:37.301 --> 24:39.521
Well, I came by to
apologize to Mrs. Mazurek

24:39.565 --> 24:41.262
for the way I acted last night.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.786
But now this?

24:43.830 --> 24:46.006
What happened?

24:46.049 --> 24:48.704
I don't know, but she's dead.

24:48.748 --> 24:52.229
What?
Oh, my God.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.405
I know.
It's horrible.

24:54.449 --> 24:56.233
Hey, do you want to
get out of here?

24:56.277 --> 24:59.541
Um, sure.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.021
I have to call my mom.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.239
All right.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.295
The whole thing is so shocking.

25:14.338 --> 25:16.602
Oh, I know.
It's horrible.

25:16.645 --> 25:19.518
But I am really glad
I got to see you.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.955
I really wanted to spend
some time with you today.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.348
Yeah, me too.

25:24.392 --> 25:26.525
I was just talking
with Charlie last night.

25:26.568 --> 25:29.266
Oh? About what?

25:30.616 --> 25:33.314
The wedding, our parents,

25:33.357 --> 25:35.795
you, him, life in general.

25:35.838 --> 25:38.275
I'm sure you two had
a lot of catching up to do.

25:38.319 --> 25:41.583
Yeah.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.846
I think you know a lot more
about me than I do about you.

25:45.805 --> 25:48.721
Well, let's change that.
You can ask me anything.

25:48.764 --> 25:51.593
Okay.

25:51.637 --> 25:55.510
Charlie tells me you never
knew your biological parents.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.381
That you were an orphan.

25:57.425 --> 26:00.297
Well, that's partly true.

26:00.341 --> 26:03.779
I was able to track down my
biological mother this year.

26:03.823 --> 26:05.781
Really?

26:05.825 --> 26:10.612
It took some effort, but
anything worth doing takes time.

26:14.398 --> 26:16.618
Charlie probably
told you that Nancy and Stuart

26:16.662 --> 26:18.533
adopted me when I was a baby.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.622
Mmm.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.058
For a while, I
thought of finding

26:22.102 --> 26:24.278
my biological parents as well.

26:24.321 --> 26:26.454
But why rock the boat?

26:26.497 --> 26:28.456
You're lucky.

26:30.893 --> 26:32.634
So what's she like?

26:32.678 --> 26:34.767
Your mother, when you met her?

26:37.291 --> 26:39.075
Disappointing.

26:42.383 --> 26:45.691
But sometimes
that makes you stronger.

26:45.734 --> 26:48.084
I always refuse to give up.

26:48.128 --> 26:52.306
Never let anybody bring
you down, no matter what.

26:52.349 --> 26:54.351
That's my mantra.

26:56.527 --> 26:59.052
Well, I could see why
Charlie thought we'd get along.

26:59.095 --> 27:01.968
Always been a bit of
a fighter myself.

27:02.011 --> 27:04.274
It's what keeps us sane.

27:13.806 --> 27:15.546
Hey, Mr. Dillon.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.636
Hey, Martin.
Charlie's in back.

27:17.679 --> 27:18.811
Thanks.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.907
Hard at work, I see.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.343
Gotta pay for this wedding.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.261
All right, so what's the story
with this dream house?

27:34.304 --> 27:35.654
Oh, I got some pictures here.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.438
It's in Park View.

27:37.481 --> 27:40.006
Sounds expensive.
$300,000.

27:40.049 --> 27:42.530
Three bedrooms,
two and a half baths, yard.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.706
Couple's getting divorced.
They had to dump it quick.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.795
It looks nice.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.797
It's a steal.

27:48.841 --> 27:51.539
Oh, listen. I can't get
away from work right now.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.106
But do you think maybe
you could take Helena

27:53.149 --> 27:54.411
over to see the house?

27:54.455 --> 27:55.848
Helena? No.

27:55.891 --> 27:57.240
You know she's not
my biggest fan.

27:57.284 --> 27:59.460
Please do this for me, man.

27:59.503 --> 28:04.334
Okay, but hand me a roll
of that duct tape.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.249
Why?

28:06.293 --> 28:07.860
I always say the wrong
things when I'm around her.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.165
I'm gonna just tape it up.

28:09.209 --> 28:10.471
Get outta here.
You owe me.

28:10.514 --> 28:12.516
All right.
Big time!

28:22.613 --> 28:24.050
Charlie picked this store

28:24.093 --> 28:25.616
because he said your family
knew the owner?

28:25.660 --> 28:27.836
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.359
Great.

28:34.321 --> 28:35.670
Becca!

28:35.714 --> 28:37.411
Charlie said you were in town!

28:37.454 --> 28:39.195
I haven't seen you
since high school. How are you?

28:39.239 --> 28:41.371
I'm good. How are you?
Good.

28:41.415 --> 28:44.244
Oh, this is
Charlie's fiancé, Helena.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.724
It's a pleasure to finally meet.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.334
I'm so happy for you guys.

28:47.377 --> 28:48.770
And you are?

28:48.814 --> 28:50.729
Monica.
I'm Thowner.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.295
We haven't got a
chance to speak.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.210
You ordered from
my assistant, Corinne.

28:54.254 --> 28:55.951
That's right.

28:55.995 --> 28:57.997
And how do you know the family?

28:58.040 --> 29:00.608
Oh, Charlie and I used
to date after high school.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.523
My God, it seems
like so long ago!

29:02.566 --> 29:04.003
I know, doesn't it?

29:04.046 --> 29:05.874
I'll get your arrangement
for you.

29:07.093 --> 29:09.443
She's so cute.

29:09.486 --> 29:13.055
So, any plans for
a bridal shower?

29:21.281 --> 29:22.630
Helena?

29:24.850 --> 29:29.115
Oh... no, I wasn't planning
on having a bridal shower.

29:29.158 --> 29:31.378
Well, I would be happy
to throw you one.

29:31.421 --> 29:34.120
We could make it coed
and invite everyone.

29:34.163 --> 29:36.513
I'd love to meet your friends.

29:36.557 --> 29:39.125
I really haven't had
a chance to meet many people

29:39.168 --> 29:41.257
since I've moved here.

29:41.301 --> 29:42.737
Well, old friends
are usually willing

29:42.781 --> 29:45.435
to fly in to help
celebrate a wedding.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.873
Not on such short notice.

29:50.310 --> 29:53.313
Here we are.

29:53.356 --> 29:56.359
So we were thinking 10
of these at the church

29:56.403 --> 29:59.232
and then smaller arrangements
on each table for the reception.

29:59.275 --> 30:01.147
You're amazing.
They look great.

30:01.190 --> 30:02.931
You caught a good one.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.933
What are the chances?
You're a lucky girl.

30:04.977 --> 30:07.936
Luck really had nothing
to do with it.

30:07.980 --> 30:10.243
Charlie and I were
meant to be together.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.723
Helena, I don't think
Monica means anything.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.900
She knows what she means.
I'm not stupid.

30:14.943 --> 30:17.946
I'm very happy for you both.

30:17.990 --> 30:19.687
I always said
Charlie deserves someone

30:19.730 --> 30:21.602
that would treat him right.

30:21.645 --> 30:25.301
I always treat people the way
they deserve to be treated.

30:25.345 --> 30:29.610
Okay. Um, so should
we complete the order?

30:29.653 --> 30:31.133
I'm not sure.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.832
I don't know if
these are quite right.

30:33.875 --> 30:36.835
I'll have to discuss it
with Charlie, my fiancé.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.535
I'm gonna see Charlie later.

30:41.578 --> 30:43.711
Why don't I take a picture
and I could show him?

30:43.754 --> 30:45.495
Great idea.

30:45.539 --> 30:48.237
I need to go.

30:48.281 --> 30:50.283
Do you want me to drive you?

30:50.326 --> 30:52.763
No, that's okay. I have some
things I need to take care of.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.896
It was very nice to meet you.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.332
Pleasure.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.382
She knows it's over between
me and Charlie, right?

31:02.425 --> 31:04.384
Like seven years ago?
Yeah.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.560
I'm happily married now.

31:06.603 --> 31:10.477
I know. She...
She clearly has a few issues.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.442
Charlie?

31:19.486 --> 31:22.315
Hey, honey.
How's your day going?

31:22.358 --> 31:25.274
Why didn't you tell me
about your ex-girlfriend?

31:25.318 --> 31:26.841
Who?

31:26.885 --> 31:28.669
I was just blindsided
at the floral shop

31:28.712 --> 31:30.758
by your old girlfriend, Monica.

31:30.801 --> 31:32.673
Why didn't you
tell me about her?

31:32.716 --> 31:35.284
Because I didn't think
it was that important?

31:35.328 --> 31:37.547
Well, what have you
told her about me?

31:37.591 --> 31:39.810
Just how we met.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.856
She's married, Helena.
Why are you even going there?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.727
Because I don't like
being lied to, Charlie.

31:43.771 --> 31:45.425
I did not lie to you.

31:45.468 --> 31:47.862
We've known her for years.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.733
She offered to help
with the wedding flowers.

31:49.777 --> 31:51.953
That's it.
You're right.

31:51.997 --> 31:54.738
I just got a little
caught off-guard.

31:54.782 --> 31:58.046
It's fine.
I'll talk to you later.

31:58.090 --> 32:00.527
Okay. Bye.

32:13.279 --> 32:15.411
But it was so long ago, right?

32:15.455 --> 32:18.719
Such a long time ago, right?

32:18.762 --> 32:21.374
But you've been talking
to her behind my back.

32:21.417 --> 32:23.028
Haven't you?

32:23.071 --> 32:26.031
Well, I've been
waiting a long time, too.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.294
And no one is gonna
come between us.

32:28.337 --> 32:31.601
No one, no one!

32:39.087 --> 32:42.003
He's just like all the others.

32:42.047 --> 32:45.615
Remember, he's just
a means to an end.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.052
You know that all men
are just the same.

32:47.095 --> 32:48.836
Shut up!

32:48.879 --> 32:50.838
Just because he dated her
for a while doesn't mean

32:50.881 --> 32:52.971
that he has feelings for her.

32:53.014 --> 32:55.756
Well, why didn't he
tell you about her?

32:55.799 --> 32:57.801
I never asked.

32:57.845 --> 33:01.196
Because you wouldn't want him
to find out about your past.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.068
You know, all about
your history,

33:03.111 --> 33:04.286
why you really came to town.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.288
Shut up! Shut up!

33:32.097 --> 33:34.708
Hey, Helena.

33:34.751 --> 33:36.753
Are you ready to see
your dream house?

33:36.797 --> 33:38.538
Of course.

33:38.581 --> 33:40.409
Listen, I was very lucky
to find this listing.

33:40.453 --> 33:43.238
It's priced to sell and
it's in Park View,

33:43.282 --> 33:44.761
one of the best neighborhoods
in the city.

33:44.805 --> 33:47.025
Great. Give me five minutes.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.161
I'll just wait right here.

34:03.998 --> 34:05.652
How are you holding up?

34:05.695 --> 34:08.089
I'm numb.

34:08.132 --> 34:10.047
It's so horrible.

34:10.091 --> 34:12.353
We just saw her last night.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.710
I know, Mom.

34:21.755 --> 34:25.324
She was a dear friend
for so many years.

34:25.367 --> 34:28.196
Did you hear anything more
about what might have happened?

34:28.239 --> 34:30.242
Her son Phil said that
the police think

34:30.284 --> 34:32.112
that she just fell off a ladder

34:32.157 --> 34:35.681
trying to reach for something,
which is so odd.

34:35.725 --> 34:38.337
She was up and down that ladder
more times than I can remember

34:38.380 --> 34:41.382
and it was never a problem.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.908
I ran into Helena at
the shop this morning.

34:44.952 --> 34:47.607
She wanted to apologize to
Mrs. Mazurek for last night,

34:47.650 --> 34:51.132
but it was too late.

34:51.176 --> 34:53.873
How did it go with her today?

34:53.917 --> 34:56.224
We had some bumps.

34:56.268 --> 34:58.139
She has a jealous streak,
for sure.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.315
And said a few
interesting things.

35:00.359 --> 35:03.013
Got a little weird with Monica.

35:03.057 --> 35:06.669
She must be going through
so many emotions now.

35:06.713 --> 35:09.150
It's got to be hard on Helena.

35:09.194 --> 35:12.414
She has no real family
to support her.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.764
I guess.

35:14.808 --> 35:18.464
I just don't understand
the rush to get married.

35:18.507 --> 35:21.206
Charlie won't listen to
anything I have to say.

35:21.249 --> 35:23.164
Did you want to hear
all we had to say

35:23.208 --> 35:26.559
before you married Doug?

35:26.602 --> 35:30.650
No, but looking back, I should
have listened to it all.

35:35.785 --> 35:39.224
And there's plenty
of cabinet space.

35:39.267 --> 35:41.791
And don't you love
the open feel of this room?

35:44.620 --> 35:49.625
There's hardwood floors,
a huge basement.

35:49.669 --> 35:53.716
A great neighborhood and
a school just down the street.

35:56.197 --> 35:58.547
What do you know
about Monica Tomlin?

35:58.591 --> 36:01.376
Monica?

36:01.420 --> 36:04.031
She owns the floral shop.

36:04.074 --> 36:06.120
Has for the past few years.
Why?

36:06.164 --> 36:08.383
How come no one ever
told me about her?

36:08.427 --> 36:09.863
She's involved in my wedding

36:09.906 --> 36:11.125
and I don't get
to find out about her

36:11.169 --> 36:12.605
and Charlie until
the last minute?

36:12.648 --> 36:15.956
Oh, I see where this is going.

36:15.999 --> 36:19.089
Listen, it's not the Best Man's
job to bring up old flames.

36:19.133 --> 36:21.396
Charlie should have told me.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.182
Charlie probably didn't
think it was an issue.

36:27.359 --> 36:29.622
Current girlfriends don't like
hearing about past girlfriends.

36:29.665 --> 36:31.798
Especially those
that were almost wives.

36:31.841 --> 36:34.627
They were almost married?

36:34.670 --> 36:38.021
They were close,
but he cut it off.

36:38.065 --> 36:40.763
What do you expect?
They were kids.

36:40.807 --> 36:43.375
Teenagers in love.

36:47.161 --> 36:49.729
You said the owners are
selling because of a divorce?

36:49.772 --> 36:52.471
That's right, and they're
willing to drop the price.

36:53.950 --> 36:55.735
I think I've seen enough.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.650
Would you please take me
to Charlie's store?

36:57.693 --> 37:00.653
Okay.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.394
This place isn't gonna
stay on the market long.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.546
Sorry to interrupt.

37:24.590 --> 37:26.418
It's okay, Mom.

37:26.461 --> 37:28.289
Do you think you could
get these keys

37:28.333 --> 37:30.552
to Mrs. Mazurek's son, Phil?

37:30.596 --> 37:33.033
Yeah, sure.
Why do we have them?

37:33.076 --> 37:35.514
Oh, your dad had them from
when he replaced a water pipe

37:35.557 --> 37:37.342
that burst some weeks ago.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.039
Yeah, okay, got it.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.609
Mom, don't you think
there's something

37:43.652 --> 37:46.394
a little odd about Helena?

37:46.438 --> 37:49.354
Well, she's certainly unique.

37:49.397 --> 37:52.618
Yeah, maybe I'm just being
over-protective of Charlie.

37:52.661 --> 37:55.142
We all have some kind
of issue, right?

37:55.185 --> 37:57.579
You know, I've gotten
to know Helena a bit

37:57.623 --> 37:59.538
since she's come over.

37:59.581 --> 38:02.932
And I really believe that
she loves your brother.

38:02.976 --> 38:05.979
Well, I offered to throw her
a bridal shower today.

38:06.022 --> 38:09.025
Well, that's a great idea!
What did she say?

38:09.069 --> 38:11.289
She didn't exactly say no.

38:11.332 --> 38:14.857
Good. Then we can arrange
to work on it together.

38:14.901 --> 38:16.119
We'll have it right here.

38:16.163 --> 38:18.208
Okay, Mom.

38:18.252 --> 38:20.776
You know, she said she didn't
have any friends to invite.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.604
Is that true?

38:22.648 --> 38:26.434
No. I've never met any,
but Charlie would know.

38:26.478 --> 38:29.568
Or you could try tracking
them down online.

38:29.611 --> 38:33.485
I mean, everybody is on that
Facebase thing, right?

38:33.528 --> 38:36.662
Everybody but her.
She's not.

38:36.705 --> 38:40.056
Well, do the best you can.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.710
Right.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.374
Helena, what a nice surprise.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.420
Hi, Stuart.

38:55.463 --> 38:57.378
Where's that future
husband of mine?

38:57.422 --> 38:58.858
That way.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.047
Guess who?

39:14.090 --> 39:15.875
Only the most beautiful
woman in the world.

39:15.918 --> 39:18.921
Right answer.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.097
What'd you think of the house?
Did you love it?

39:21.141 --> 39:23.752
Not really.

39:23.796 --> 39:26.668
It was a little too small
and dark for my taste.

39:26.712 --> 39:29.454
Oh, Martin thought
it'd be perfect for us.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.412
Well, Martin's trying
to sell us a house.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.936
Okay, what's wrong?
I don't get it.

39:33.980 --> 39:35.808
Nothing, Charlie,

39:35.851 --> 39:37.375
but why are we rushing this?

39:37.418 --> 39:39.594
We have the rest
of our lives together.

39:39.638 --> 39:42.205
And I have a house I'm leasing
that we can both live in.

39:42.249 --> 39:44.730
We don't need to decide
anything right now.

39:44.773 --> 39:47.472
All right, I'll tell him
we changed our mind.

39:47.515 --> 39:50.736
Thank you, Charlie.
I love you.

39:50.779 --> 39:51.824
I love you.

40:25.074 --> 40:27.163
Wedding web page is up.

40:27.207 --> 40:28.513
For any friends who
can't make it,

40:28.556 --> 40:30.602
we can upload
the wedding photos too.

40:30.645 --> 40:33.431
Becca, you are so thoughtful.

40:33.474 --> 40:36.434
I try.
Where is everybody?

40:36.477 --> 40:39.654
Mmm, well, Charlie and Helena
had to go out for a while.

40:39.698 --> 40:41.351
And your dad's working late.

40:41.395 --> 40:43.049
So it's just the two of us.

40:43.092 --> 40:44.790
Hungry?

40:44.833 --> 40:48.489
Of course.
That looks great.

40:48.533 --> 40:52.014
So how are the preparations
going for the bridal shower?

40:52.058 --> 40:53.625
What's to prepare?

40:53.668 --> 40:55.017
I'm starting to wonder
if Helena's

40:55.061 --> 40:56.715
in the witness
protection program.

40:56.758 --> 40:58.499
It's like she doesn't
exist online

40:58.543 --> 40:59.761
except for her dessert website.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.502
It's strange.

41:01.546 --> 41:04.070
Well, if we can't find
any of her friends,

41:04.113 --> 41:07.639
we'll invite ours.
Okay.

41:07.682 --> 41:11.338
Oh, did you cancel the order
at Monica's place?

41:11.381 --> 41:15.951
Yes. Helena didn't
like the arrangement.

41:15.995 --> 41:18.214
Personally, I didn't have
a problem with it,

41:18.258 --> 41:20.347
but it's her wedding.

41:20.390 --> 41:22.349
That it is.

41:22.392 --> 41:24.873
Did you get a chance to
return the Mazurek's keys?

41:24.917 --> 41:27.528
No, I didn't.
I'll do it.

41:27.572 --> 41:30.531
I promise.
Please.

41:30.575 --> 41:32.054
Okay, Mom.

41:38.365 --> 41:40.585
I'm so glad we're doing this.

41:40.628 --> 41:43.065
It's nice to have some
time to ourselves.

41:43.109 --> 41:44.850
I'm just counting down the days.

41:44.893 --> 41:47.156
I know. I can't wait.
It's going to be perfect.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.289
Well, I know nothing
can ever be perfect.

41:49.332 --> 41:51.030
But it'll be close.

41:51.073 --> 41:52.988
And Becca is so happy
you agreed on

41:53.032 --> 41:54.076
the shower for tomorrow night.

41:54.120 --> 41:56.078
She's so great.

41:56.122 --> 41:58.124
I really appreciate
everything Becca's been doing.

41:58.167 --> 42:00.343
She's starting to already
feel like a sister.

42:00.387 --> 42:02.476
Oh, good.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.870
I'm gonna go freshen up.

42:04.913 --> 42:06.001
Okay.

42:14.836 --> 42:16.534
Charlie!
Hey!

42:16.577 --> 42:17.839
We don't usually go out

42:17.883 --> 42:19.362
but Justin and
I love this place.

42:19.406 --> 42:20.407
Hey, I am so sorry
that we had to cancel

42:20.450 --> 42:22.061
the flowers for the wedding.

42:22.104 --> 42:23.802
I know you must have
gone through so much

42:23.845 --> 42:25.934
trouble for all that.

42:25.978 --> 42:29.372
And there was nothing wrong with
the arrangements, I promise.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.200
Once I saw the look
on Helena's face

42:31.244 --> 42:32.593
when I told her we used to date,

42:32.637 --> 42:35.509
I didn't want to
say anything else.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.598
Are you sure about this wedding?

42:37.642 --> 42:39.861
Oh, completely,
completely, yeah.

42:39.905 --> 42:41.341
You just need to get
to know Helena.

42:41.384 --> 42:43.256
I'll pass, thanks.

42:52.004 --> 42:54.528
She's trying to
take him away from you.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.964
Don't you see that?

42:56.008 --> 42:59.228
No. They're just friends.

42:59.272 --> 43:03.102
I trust Charlie.
He loves me.

43:03.145 --> 43:05.495
Trust no one.

43:05.539 --> 43:07.846
She hates you for
canceling the flowers.

43:07.889 --> 43:10.370
And now she's going
to steal your man.

43:14.679 --> 43:16.637
Shut up!

43:16.681 --> 43:18.247
I really just
wanted to come over

43:18.291 --> 43:20.380
and wish you all the happiness
with your new life.

43:20.423 --> 43:22.643
Have a wonderful wedding.

43:22.687 --> 43:25.690
And I hope you have as good of
a marriage as me and Justin do.

43:25.733 --> 43:27.735
Thank you so much, Monica.
At means a lot.

43:27.779 --> 43:28.823
Thank you.

43:32.522 --> 43:34.612
So good to see you.
You too.

43:42.924 --> 43:45.100
Would you take me home?
I'm not feeling well.

43:45.144 --> 43:46.885
Now? Are you sure?

43:46.928 --> 43:48.713
Yeah.
I just need to lie down.

43:48.756 --> 43:50.366
I'll wait for you in the car.

43:50.410 --> 43:51.803
Okay.

44:01.769 --> 44:03.684
You want me to come tuck you in?

44:03.728 --> 44:05.599
That's okay.
You don't have to come inside.

44:05.643 --> 44:06.644
I'll manage.

44:06.687 --> 44:08.341
You sure?

44:08.384 --> 44:10.517
Yeah. I'm just gonna
take a nice hot bath

44:10.560 --> 44:11.997
and go to bed.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.694
It's been a long day.

44:13.738 --> 44:14.913
Okay.

44:17.002 --> 44:19.482
I love you.
I love you, too.

44:54.300 --> 44:56.432
You know what you have to do...

44:56.476 --> 44:57.956
Don't you?

45:17.627 --> 45:19.020
If you could only see
the way she looked at me

45:19.064 --> 45:20.761
after she found out
about me and Charlie.

45:20.805 --> 45:22.197
If looks could kill.

45:22.241 --> 45:23.764
Well, if Charlie's happy,

45:23.808 --> 45:25.157
you have to leave him
to his choices.

45:25.200 --> 45:26.767
Oh, I know.

45:26.811 --> 45:28.595
I just hate to see him
marrying a crazy person.

45:28.638 --> 45:29.944
Yeah.
I know what that's like.

45:29.988 --> 45:31.685
Oh, hilarious.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.861
Didn't we leave the lights on?

45:33.905 --> 45:35.645
I thought so.

45:42.652 --> 45:44.045
I don't know, hon.

45:47.005 --> 45:48.876
Oh, my God!

45:51.836 --> 45:53.707
Nice place you got here.

45:56.841 --> 45:58.277
Spotless.

46:04.370 --> 46:06.546
You just couldn't
leave him alone.

46:06.589 --> 46:08.766
There's nothing going
on between us, I swear!

46:10.637 --> 46:13.118
Liar!

46:21.474 --> 46:24.956
I told you I always treat people

46:24.999 --> 46:27.785
the way they deserve
to be treated.

46:54.376 --> 46:56.204
Found you.

47:32.110 --> 47:36.592
All right, Mrs. Mazurek, what
were you trying to tell me?

47:45.732 --> 47:48.300
Rebecca?
What do you think?

47:49.910 --> 47:51.651
You look beautiful.

47:51.694 --> 47:53.435
Isn't it the perfect choice?

47:53.479 --> 47:55.307
I love wearing white.

47:55.350 --> 47:56.525
You wear it well.

47:59.746 --> 48:00.921
Hello?

48:00.965 --> 48:02.836
Hello.
Is this Rebecca Dillon?

48:02.880 --> 48:04.707
Yes. Speaking.
Who's this?

48:04.751 --> 48:06.666
My name's Glenn Carr.

48:06.709 --> 48:08.755
I saw your link on the Bakers
Across America message board

48:08.798 --> 48:11.018
about the upcoming wedding
of a Helena Richard?

48:11.062 --> 48:13.760
Oh, yeah.
Hold on a second.

48:19.331 --> 48:21.637
Yeah, she's marrying my brother.

48:21.681 --> 48:23.291
Are you a friend?

48:23.335 --> 48:25.380
Actually, we were related once.

48:25.424 --> 48:27.556
But I've lost contact.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.689
I've been trying to track her
down for the past five months.

48:29.732 --> 48:31.865
What do you mean, were related?

48:31.909 --> 48:36.043
Well, based on the photo
that you posted online,

48:36.087 --> 48:38.263
I'd have to say that
Helena Richard is the same woman

48:38.306 --> 48:39.655
who married my brother.

48:39.699 --> 48:40.961
Rebecca?

48:41.005 --> 48:43.616
What do you think of the sash?

48:43.659 --> 48:46.488
Hold on a sec.
It looks great.

48:46.532 --> 48:48.142
Sorry.
It's work-related.

48:48.186 --> 48:50.666
I have to take this.
It'll just be a minute.

48:50.710 --> 48:54.366
Wait. What?
She's... She's married?

48:54.409 --> 48:58.326
This can't be the same woman
we're talking about then.

48:58.370 --> 49:00.502
Well, she's not married now.

49:00.546 --> 49:02.983
My brother died on the altar
during the ceremony.

49:03.027 --> 49:05.986
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That's horrible.

49:06.030 --> 49:09.598
So they were never married?

49:09.642 --> 49:11.339
Oh, no, they were married.

49:11.383 --> 49:13.559
They eloped to Vegas
two months prior.

49:13.602 --> 49:16.257
The ceremony was just
to make my parents happy.

49:16.301 --> 49:19.434
You're talking about Helena?
Helena Richard?

49:19.478 --> 49:21.567
Well, I knew her
as Helena Clark.

49:21.610 --> 49:23.743
She was a widow.
A widow?

49:23.786 --> 49:26.354
Yeah, Clark was the name
of her previous husband.

49:26.398 --> 49:28.530
The one who died of carbon
monoxide poisoning, apparently.

49:28.574 --> 49:30.358
You can't be serious.

49:30.402 --> 49:34.058
Look, my brother was healthy.

49:34.101 --> 49:36.147
It doesn't make any sense
that he died so young.

49:36.190 --> 49:38.236
She tried to have him cremated.

49:38.279 --> 49:40.281
But luckily enough,
we were able to stop that.

49:40.325 --> 49:42.588
It took us forever
to get an autopsy order,

49:42.631 --> 49:44.242
but once we get
that report back,

49:44.285 --> 49:46.505
I am sure that we are going
to learn something.

49:46.548 --> 49:49.334
Do you think Helena had
something to do with it?

49:49.377 --> 49:52.032
After his death, she got
a huge chunk of his money

49:52.076 --> 49:53.512
and she just disappeared.

49:53.555 --> 49:55.731
I was searching for her.
I saw your link.

49:55.775 --> 49:56.906
I thought I should reach out.

49:56.950 --> 49:59.257
Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

49:59.300 --> 50:01.781
She had darker hair then.

50:01.824 --> 50:03.739
But I'm pretty sure that's her.

50:03.783 --> 50:07.047
Mr. Carr, where do you live?

50:07.091 --> 50:08.788
Amherst, Massachusetts.

50:08.831 --> 50:10.790
Is there any chance I could
get you to come up here?

50:10.833 --> 50:13.445
Maybe confront her face to face?

50:13.488 --> 50:15.751
Of course,
but I'll tell you what.

50:15.795 --> 50:17.536
Don't tell her I'm coming.

50:17.579 --> 50:20.147
I want to see the look on her
face when she sees me.

50:20.191 --> 50:22.062
I'll text you the address.

50:23.585 --> 50:25.109
Important work call?

50:25.152 --> 50:28.503
Yeah, a new client.

50:28.547 --> 50:30.940
I need total honesty
from my sister...

50:32.551 --> 50:34.379
about my dress.

50:34.422 --> 50:37.599
The dress.
It looks fabulous.

50:39.340 --> 50:41.473
I've always dreamed
of a white wedding.

50:59.839 --> 51:02.015
Where's Charlie?

51:02.059 --> 51:05.062
Oh, he's out with Martin.
They're getting their tuxedos.

51:05.105 --> 51:06.846
Brother has to look good.

51:06.889 --> 51:08.282
Doesn't get married every day.

51:08.326 --> 51:10.632
Neither does Helena.

51:10.676 --> 51:13.113
She's been waiting
a long time saving herself

51:13.157 --> 51:14.723
for this special day.

51:14.767 --> 51:16.812
Don't be so sure.

51:16.856 --> 51:18.292
Hey, did Helena
ever say anything

51:18.336 --> 51:19.467
about being married before?

51:19.511 --> 51:21.339
What are you talking about?

51:21.382 --> 51:22.601
I was just wondering.

51:22.644 --> 51:24.907
What's this all about?

51:24.951 --> 51:27.475
I just don't think things
are adding up about her.

51:27.519 --> 51:29.651
Don't you think that
Charlie's rushing into this

51:29.695 --> 51:31.349
without knowing everything?

51:31.392 --> 51:33.351
Now I know I taught you
to question everything

51:33.394 --> 51:34.917
when you were growing up.

51:34.961 --> 51:39.879
But Charlie and Helena
are very happy together.

51:39.922 --> 51:44.188
Sometimes you have to keep an
open mind and a closed mouth.

51:46.277 --> 51:48.105
Okay, fine, forget it.

52:02.031 --> 52:03.294
Helena's on her way over.

52:03.337 --> 52:04.208
Is the kitchen
ready for her, Mom?

52:04.251 --> 52:05.861
Oh, it will be.

52:05.905 --> 52:08.951
Big baking day today.
And the shower later.

52:08.995 --> 52:11.128
Baking day?

52:11.171 --> 52:14.174
Yeah. Helena's supplying
the cake for the reception.

52:14.218 --> 52:18.526
She's making some
gigantic display.

52:18.570 --> 52:22.182
Yeah. It's this big base layer
of cake with multi-tiered...

52:22.226 --> 52:23.836
I don't know.

52:23.879 --> 52:25.185
She'll explain it better
when she gets here.

52:25.229 --> 52:26.143
But, Dad, we need
to run the final payment

52:26.186 --> 52:27.187
over to the caterer.

52:27.231 --> 52:29.189
Whatever you say, son.

52:29.233 --> 52:31.104
I put up a web page for her
friends who can't make it.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.411
We can post videos and
photos of the ceremony.

52:33.454 --> 52:35.239
That's great.
Thank you.

52:35.282 --> 52:37.023
Listen, even if
she doesn't show it,

52:37.066 --> 52:39.634
I know she's very
appreciative of the shower

52:39.678 --> 52:40.896
and everything that
you're doing for her.

52:42.463 --> 52:45.292
Oh.

52:45.336 --> 52:47.512
What's up, Bobby?

52:47.555 --> 52:49.209
Please don't tell me there's
a problem with the champagne.

52:53.213 --> 52:55.694
Now why did it get
so quiet over here?

52:55.737 --> 52:57.086
Thank you, Bobby.

52:57.130 --> 52:59.088
No, I hadn't heard.

52:59.132 --> 53:00.525
Yeah. Bye.

53:03.267 --> 53:04.833
What's going on?
What's wrong?

53:07.749 --> 53:10.361
Monica Tomlin was
found dead last night.

53:11.666 --> 53:13.407
What?

53:13.451 --> 53:16.802
Justin and Monica were
attacked when they got home.

53:16.845 --> 53:18.282
The police say they might
have walked in

53:18.325 --> 53:20.980
on a robbery in progress.

53:21.023 --> 53:22.634
Justin's still in the hospital.

53:22.677 --> 53:24.201
That's crazy.

53:24.244 --> 53:25.245
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.

53:25.289 --> 53:26.681
I was just with her last night.

53:26.725 --> 53:29.118
I thought you were
with Helena last night?

53:29.162 --> 53:32.818
I was. We ran into
Monica at the bar.

53:32.861 --> 53:36.038
She wished me good luck.
She said have a good life.

53:36.082 --> 53:39.390
She gave me a hug and
then we said goodbye.

53:39.433 --> 53:42.001
All this with Helena
standing right there?

53:42.044 --> 53:45.352
No.
She went to the bathroom.

53:45.396 --> 53:47.354
I don't think she
saw Monica at all, actually.

53:47.398 --> 53:49.617
I can't imagine coming home

53:49.661 --> 53:52.098
and finding someone
in the house.

53:54.405 --> 53:58.583
Are you sure that she didn't
see you guys talking, hugging?

53:58.626 --> 54:01.716
I don't know, Becca.
What are you trying to say?

54:01.760 --> 54:04.371
Look, I didn't want to say
anything until I knew for sure.

54:04.415 --> 54:07.461
But I'm the only one that
thinks what's been going on

54:07.505 --> 54:09.768
around here is
a little peculiar?

54:09.811 --> 54:12.814
I mean, Helena practically
lashes out at Mrs. Mazurek.

54:12.858 --> 54:15.164
Then she finds out about
Charlie and Monica's past

54:15.208 --> 54:16.470
and almost goes ballistic.

54:16.514 --> 54:18.037
I mean, you guys weren't there.

54:18.080 --> 54:19.647
She looked like
she wanted to kill her.

54:19.691 --> 54:21.475
Drop it, Becca.
I'm serious.

54:21.519 --> 54:22.998
I spoke with a Mr. Carr...

54:23.042 --> 54:24.913
Enough!

54:24.957 --> 54:27.568
Stay out of it, Becca!

54:27.612 --> 54:29.918
I love Helena!

54:29.962 --> 54:30.963
And she loves me.

54:33.270 --> 54:35.272
I am sorry things didn't work
out between you and Doug,

54:35.315 --> 54:37.622
but we are not you guys.

54:39.450 --> 54:40.755
Understand?

54:40.799 --> 54:43.192
Yes.

54:43.236 --> 54:45.020
Okay.

54:46.326 --> 54:48.763
Okay.

54:48.807 --> 54:50.896
That's Helena.

54:50.939 --> 54:52.332
Please.

55:02.516 --> 55:03.996
Mom? Dad?

55:11.395 --> 55:12.961
Hello?

55:15.181 --> 55:16.878
Hi, honey.
Let me take these for you.

55:16.922 --> 55:19.011
Oh, thank you.
Hi.

55:19.054 --> 55:22.014
Hi, Nancy.
I brought my baking supplies.

55:22.057 --> 55:24.233
Oh, great.
Thank you.

55:24.277 --> 55:26.279
Where's the wedding dress?

55:26.323 --> 55:29.195
Oh, it had to get some
last-minute alterations.

55:29.238 --> 55:32.111
Well, I'm sure
it'll be beautiful.

55:32.154 --> 55:33.982
Well, Becca did help me
pick it out.

55:37.508 --> 55:41.163
Oh, need a hand with
those supplies, ladies?

55:41.207 --> 55:42.382
No, we're fine.

55:42.426 --> 55:44.079
We'll get out of your way.

55:44.123 --> 55:46.038
Charlie and I have to meet up
with the caterer.

55:46.081 --> 55:47.692
Oh?

55:47.735 --> 55:49.389
Don't worry.
Be back in time for the shower.

55:49.433 --> 55:50.390
Oh.

55:51.913 --> 55:53.698
Let's get started.

55:57.049 --> 56:00.139
I can't help but think
about poor Monica.

56:00.182 --> 56:02.968
It was so tragic what happened.

56:03.011 --> 56:04.883
Charlie's pretty upset.

56:04.926 --> 56:08.060
Well, I guess the one
up side is a good thing

56:08.103 --> 56:10.018
we went with a different
shop for the flowers.

56:10.062 --> 56:12.499
Otherwise, we might not ever
have gotten our order in time.

56:18.026 --> 56:20.420
So what can I do next?

56:20.464 --> 56:24.119
Oh, would you preheat
the oven to 325?

56:24.163 --> 56:26.165
And, Becca, would you
continue stirring

56:26.208 --> 56:28.167
while I finish up with this?

56:28.210 --> 56:29.211
Sure.

56:32.606 --> 56:33.955
I'm really glad
we're getting this time

56:33.999 --> 56:36.044
to really bond
as sisters, Becca.

56:36.088 --> 56:39.004
It's taken me a long time
to get here.

56:39.047 --> 56:43.400
I'm happy that you're happy.

56:43.443 --> 56:46.359
Feels like I've been waiting
my whole life to have a family.

56:48.317 --> 56:52.670
Becca, would you be
my Maid of Honor?

56:55.847 --> 56:57.152
Um...

56:57.196 --> 56:58.937
Oh, of course.

56:58.980 --> 57:02.070
I'm touched that
you've considered me.

57:02.114 --> 57:05.073
Thank you so much.

57:05.117 --> 57:07.293
This means the world to me.

57:09.295 --> 57:11.210
I have a surprise for you
that's gonna bring us

57:11.253 --> 57:12.733
even closer together.

57:12.777 --> 57:15.083
Really?
What is it?

57:17.477 --> 57:19.305
I'll tell you after the wedding.

57:41.588 --> 57:45.026
It's nice he included the wait
staff for the reception.

57:45.070 --> 57:46.637
Yeah.

57:46.680 --> 57:47.855
I give him a lot of
discounts at the store.

57:47.899 --> 57:49.204
So he's being extra nice.

57:49.248 --> 57:50.989
Dad, thanks for all your help.

57:51.032 --> 57:53.905
Oh, your mom and I are always
glad to help when we can.

57:56.081 --> 57:58.257
Dad, am I doing the right thing?

57:58.300 --> 58:00.520
What's the matter, son?
You getting cold feet?

58:00.564 --> 58:01.913
Oh, no, of course not.

58:01.956 --> 58:05.264
Just how do you ever really know

58:05.307 --> 58:06.613
if you're doing the
right thing, you know?

58:06.657 --> 58:08.485
You don't.

58:08.528 --> 58:10.269
I knew your mom for
only two months

58:10.312 --> 58:11.792
before we got married,
faults and all.

58:11.836 --> 58:15.143
Now look at us.
33 years together.

58:15.187 --> 58:16.971
Yeah.

58:17.015 --> 58:19.583
You're gonna be just fine, son.

58:19.626 --> 58:20.758
Come on.

58:32.944 --> 58:34.815
A sound machine!

58:34.859 --> 58:37.557
Becca, how did you know
I wanted one of these?

58:37.601 --> 58:40.429
Well, it's no secret that
Charlie snores at night.

58:40.473 --> 58:42.301
Hey, it's not that bad!

58:42.344 --> 58:44.390
Oh, it is that bad.

58:46.653 --> 58:48.612
Thank you, sister.

58:48.655 --> 58:50.352
Here you go. Thanks.

58:56.402 --> 59:00.101
Oh, David, this is perfect!

59:00.145 --> 59:03.540
I'm always making him run out
in the morning to get my coffee.

59:03.583 --> 59:05.629
Is this a hint that
you're tired of doing it?

59:05.672 --> 59:07.587
You said it, not me.

59:09.110 --> 59:11.852
Thank you.

59:11.896 --> 59:14.202
You haven't opened our gift yet.

59:14.246 --> 59:16.814
Oh, I haven't forgotten.

59:19.556 --> 59:20.948
Oh...

59:20.992 --> 59:22.646
Stuart and I wanted you to have

59:22.689 --> 59:24.691
a little extra spending money.

59:24.735 --> 59:26.693
There are going to be
so many things

59:26.737 --> 59:28.913
that you're going to have
to buy after you're married.

59:28.956 --> 59:33.526
That is so sweet.
Thank you so much.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.006
Oh...

59:35.049 --> 59:37.008
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

59:37.051 --> 59:38.836
Of course.

59:38.879 --> 59:42.579
And thank you, everyone,
for being here today.

59:42.622 --> 59:44.711
And especially thank you
to my sister, Becca,

59:44.755 --> 59:47.366
for throwing together
this shower so last-minute.

59:47.409 --> 59:50.108
I would have never
had one without her.

59:50.151 --> 59:52.545
Happy to do it.

59:54.199 --> 59:57.811
Oh.

59:57.855 --> 01:00:00.118
Oh, my wedding dress
is ready to be picked up.

01:00:00.161 --> 01:00:03.774
I'll get it.
You stay and enjoy the party.

01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:07.212
Are you sure?
I can go with you.

01:00:07.255 --> 01:00:09.214
No, let Becca go.

01:00:09.257 --> 01:00:12.652
I won't know what to do with
your cupcakes if you leave.

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:14.436
All right.
Well, they close at five.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.004
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

01:00:17.048 --> 01:00:18.223
You're the best.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.120
Thank you again, David,
for the coffeemaker.

01:01:29.163 --> 01:01:31.122
Let's just make sure we get
a lot of use out of it.

01:01:31.165 --> 01:01:34.212
Oh, all right.
Sounds good.

01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:37.868
Hey, my gift for the shower
is going to be taking care

01:01:37.911 --> 01:01:39.391
of the bar at the reception.

01:01:39.434 --> 01:01:42.089
Thank you, Martin.

01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:44.309
Well, you're welcome.
I guess I'll see you later.

01:01:44.352 --> 01:01:46.006
All right.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:47.660
Let's coordinate about
the reception dinner?

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.401
All right, great. Cool.

01:01:53.797 --> 01:01:56.147
I can't wait to have
you all to myself.

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:57.714
I feel the same way.

01:02:03.763 --> 01:02:05.896
I feel like the luckiest
girl in the world.

01:02:05.939 --> 01:02:09.987
We're lucky to have you
as part of our family.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:11.640
Now I think the batter is ready.

01:02:11.684 --> 01:02:14.687
Oh, I'd say it is.
Well done, Nancy.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:17.516
Now we just have to pour it
into the tins.

01:02:17.559 --> 01:02:18.996
Okay.
Wait a minute.

01:02:22.129 --> 01:02:23.609
Oh, shoot!

01:02:23.652 --> 01:02:25.176
The tiers have
to be different sizes

01:02:25.219 --> 01:02:26.743
and I forgot the mini tins
for the top cupcakes.

01:02:26.786 --> 01:02:28.222
Well, does it really matter?

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:34.272
Of course, it does.
The cake has to be perfect.

01:02:34.315 --> 01:02:36.622
Everything has to be perfect.

01:02:36.665 --> 01:02:39.016
I'll just go home and grab them.

01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:41.888
I know exactly where they are.
10 minutes at the most.

01:02:45.805 --> 01:02:46.893
Oh.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:56.947
Where are you going?

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:58.731
I forgot the mini tins at home.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.733
Oh, okay.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.300
Well, I can't finish
the cake without them.

01:03:02.343 --> 01:03:03.954
I'll be right back.

01:03:29.196 --> 01:03:31.459
I told you to trust me.

01:03:31.503 --> 01:03:34.462
Mrs. Mazurek and Monica were
just standing in your way.

01:03:34.506 --> 01:03:37.378
Now look how great everything
is turning out.

01:03:37.422 --> 01:03:39.859
I'm going to marry
the perfect husband.

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:43.602
He's has the perfect family
who loves and supports you.

01:03:43.645 --> 01:03:46.344
And I'll have the sister
I've always wanted.

01:03:46.387 --> 01:03:49.913
We might still have to do
something about Martin.

01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:53.351
No! It ends here.

01:03:53.394 --> 01:03:55.222
Have it your way.

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.173
Hello?

01:04:33.217 --> 01:04:34.653
Yes, I know.
My sister's coming to get it.

01:04:34.696 --> 01:04:35.697
Is she not there yet?

01:04:38.396 --> 01:04:41.399
Yes, I know you close at five.
I'll give her a call.

01:04:50.103 --> 01:04:51.800
"Traffic. On my way to shop.

01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:54.238
I'll get there by five."

01:04:54.281 --> 01:04:55.804
Good sister.

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:25.747
I knew you were in that shop.

01:05:42.764 --> 01:05:45.115
Mmm, smells great!

01:05:45.158 --> 01:05:46.986
Oh, I just can't resist.

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:48.596
Oh, don't you dare!
I need those.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.946
I wouldn't dare.

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:51.904
You're the one I can't resist.

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.732
Oh, another batch ready.

01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:55.255
Let me help.

01:05:55.299 --> 01:05:57.170
Oh, be careful.

01:05:57.214 --> 01:05:59.042
Shouldn't Becca be back by now?

01:05:59.085 --> 01:06:01.435
Oh, her text said that
she was stuck in traffic.

01:06:01.479 --> 01:06:03.437
You know, I don't know
how you do it.

01:06:03.481 --> 01:06:05.004
I've done a lot of
baking over the years,

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:06.875
but nothing like this.

01:06:06.919 --> 01:06:08.877
Well, you know what they say.

01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:09.791
The fastest way to
a man's heart...

01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:13.882
But then you have to keep
an eye on the stomach.

01:06:13.926 --> 01:06:17.625
Hey!
I resemble that remark!

01:06:17.669 --> 01:06:19.540
Oh, Stuart, we have to go.

01:06:19.584 --> 01:06:21.586
I promised Phil
that we would stop by.

01:06:21.629 --> 01:06:24.284
Mrs. Mazurek's son?
Yes.

01:06:24.328 --> 01:06:27.896
Oh, and you're coming with,
aren't you, Charlie?

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.943
Oh, and just leave Helena
all by herself?

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:34.033
But you've known Phil
since you were kids.

01:06:35.948 --> 01:06:38.777
Okay, I...
I'll be fine. Go.

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.953
I'm sure Phil will
appreciate the company.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:43.173
Okay.
We'll be back in no time.

01:06:43.216 --> 01:06:45.914
Come on.

01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:47.220
Bye, honey.
Bye.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:58.405
I think they finally
accepted me.

01:06:58.449 --> 01:07:01.452
You've found a new home.

01:07:01.495 --> 01:07:03.845
Don't let anyone
take it from you.

01:07:03.889 --> 01:07:06.022
Permanent home.

01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:33.919
It's open.
Come in.

01:07:40.012 --> 01:07:41.535
Hello?

01:07:46.366 --> 01:07:48.107
Rebecca?

01:07:48.151 --> 01:07:51.328
No, it's Helena!
I'm in the kitchen!

01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:09.259
Can I help you?

01:08:09.302 --> 01:08:11.261
Helena?

01:08:11.304 --> 01:08:13.219
Yes?

01:08:13.263 --> 01:08:14.699
Do I know you?

01:08:16.917 --> 01:08:19.486
Helena, it's me, Glenn.

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:20.835
George's brother.

01:08:20.879 --> 01:08:22.402
George.

01:08:22.446 --> 01:08:24.578
I knew a George once.

01:08:24.622 --> 01:08:26.711
A long time ago.

01:08:26.754 --> 01:08:29.366
It was six months ago.

01:08:29.408 --> 01:08:30.889
How is he?

01:08:30.932 --> 01:08:33.152
He's dead!

01:08:33.196 --> 01:08:35.894
He died on the altar
right in front of you.

01:08:35.937 --> 01:08:38.113
You can't tell me you
don't remember that!

01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:40.116
Oh, that's right.

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:43.249
George had one of
my special cupcakes.

01:08:43.292 --> 01:08:47.166
He was not faithful,
not faithful at all.

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:50.734
I saw the way he was
looking at the girl, Jesse.

01:08:50.778 --> 01:08:52.779
They had something going on.

01:08:52.823 --> 01:08:54.912
What are you saying?

01:08:54.956 --> 01:08:57.133
Just say it.

01:08:57.176 --> 01:08:58.698
You murdered my brother.

01:08:58.743 --> 01:09:02.050
He had to be stopped, Glenn.

01:09:02.094 --> 01:09:04.357
It was very disrespectful to me.

01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:06.881
Especially on my wedding day!

01:09:06.925 --> 01:09:11.537
Oh, have you come
for my wedding, Glenn?

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:13.540
That is so sweet of you.

01:09:13.584 --> 01:09:16.108
I came here
to stop your wedding!

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.676
You shouldn't have done that.

01:09:18.719 --> 01:09:20.634
Seems like I was just in time.

01:09:20.678 --> 01:09:22.984
She's worried her brother's
gonna marry a psychopath.

01:09:23.028 --> 01:09:24.638
I am not the one who's crazy!

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:27.424
Where are you going?

01:09:27.466 --> 01:09:29.033
To finish this.

01:09:29.077 --> 01:09:29.991
Glenn?

01:09:32.385 --> 01:09:33.560
What?

01:09:42.656 --> 01:09:45.484
You are not going
to ruin my wedding.

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:47.444
Nobody will!

01:10:01.109 --> 01:10:02.067
Ooh.

01:10:11.729 --> 01:10:13.339
Well, I'm glad I went there.

01:10:13.383 --> 01:10:15.428
I really am.
Yeah, let me have that.

01:10:25.482 --> 01:10:26.918
Helena?

01:10:32.619 --> 01:10:34.099
Helena!

01:10:34.142 --> 01:10:36.928
Oh! Oh, my God!
What happened?

01:10:36.971 --> 01:10:39.365
He just came into
the house and attacked me!

01:10:39.409 --> 01:10:42.281
He said he had been
following me for months.

01:10:42.325 --> 01:10:44.327
I just grabbed the frying pan
to defend myself.

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:46.285
Oh, God, I think
I might have killed him!

01:10:46.329 --> 01:10:47.808
I had to!

01:10:47.852 --> 01:10:50.507
He's still breathing.
I'm calling 911!

01:10:53.074 --> 01:10:54.337
Are you okay?

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:56.948
Who is he?
Where did he come from?

01:10:56.991 --> 01:10:59.690
I don't know.
He just came into the house.

01:10:59.733 --> 01:11:00.952
I think it was unlocked.

01:11:00.995 --> 01:11:03.563
Oh, Becca, careful!

01:11:03.607 --> 01:11:06.000
Oh, my God!
Who is he?

01:11:15.923 --> 01:11:17.838
Glenn Carr.

01:11:17.882 --> 01:11:21.233
What did he say to you?
What did you do?

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.279
Why is he following you?

01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:25.150
Glenn was her brother-in-law.

01:11:25.193 --> 01:11:27.108
He wanted to talk to her
before the wedding.

01:11:27.152 --> 01:11:29.241
You know this man?

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:31.809
He's the brother of
her dead husband.

01:11:31.852 --> 01:11:33.463
You're not making any sense.

01:11:33.506 --> 01:11:34.942
Glenn found me online.

01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:36.422
We spoke on the phone yesterday.

01:11:36.466 --> 01:11:38.511
You invited this lunatic
into our home?

01:11:38.555 --> 01:11:41.645
A complete stranger?
What were you thinking, Becca?

01:11:41.688 --> 01:11:44.125
You don't understand!
She's been married before!

01:11:44.169 --> 01:11:45.910
Twice!

01:11:45.953 --> 01:11:48.695
Why are saying these
horrible things about me?

01:11:48.739 --> 01:11:50.480
Is it true?
No!

01:11:50.523 --> 01:11:52.438
Becca, you're my sister!

01:11:52.482 --> 01:11:53.918
We are not sisters.

01:11:53.961 --> 01:11:55.659
Shut up!
I've had enough of you!

01:11:55.702 --> 01:11:57.008
Get out!

01:12:07.279 --> 01:12:09.977
Hey, I am so sorry.

01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:12.110
I don't know why she did that.

01:12:12.153 --> 01:12:14.504
I just wanted Becca to love me.

01:12:14.547 --> 01:12:17.898
Of course, of course.
We all love you.

01:12:17.942 --> 01:12:20.074
Come on, we need to get you
to a hospital.

01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:21.902
No.
No hospitals ever again!

01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:23.208
But you're hurt.

01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:24.818
No. I'll be all right.

01:12:24.862 --> 01:12:26.733
I just want to marry you,
Charlie.

01:12:26.777 --> 01:12:28.431
So we could be together forever.

01:12:28.474 --> 01:12:30.171
That's what you want, right?

01:12:30.215 --> 01:12:32.391
Of course, yes, of course.

01:12:32.435 --> 01:12:34.524
But we got to take care
of this first, okay?

01:12:34.567 --> 01:12:35.916
Come on, come on.

01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:52.498
I got your preliminary
statements for the time being.

01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:54.935
But I'm gonna need both of you
to come down to headquarters

01:12:54.979 --> 01:12:56.850
so I can get the rest
of your statements.

01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:58.548
Yeah, all right.
Yep.

01:12:58.591 --> 01:13:00.027
All right.
Thank you.

01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:01.028
We'll be in touch, folks.

01:13:01.072 --> 01:13:03.770
Thank you, officer.

01:13:03.814 --> 01:13:05.903
I don't know why she
wouldn't go to the hospital.

01:13:05.946 --> 01:13:08.514
Paramedics said she was fine.

01:13:08.558 --> 01:13:10.168
Not a scratch on her.

01:13:15.565 --> 01:13:18.481
Hey. You guys okay?

01:13:18.524 --> 01:13:21.919
We're fine.

01:13:21.962 --> 01:13:25.009
I got to go for a drive.
I need to clear my head.

01:13:25.052 --> 01:13:26.489
Take it easy.

01:13:31.581 --> 01:13:33.626
All I'm saying is that
after what's happened,

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:36.760
I think maybe we should push
the wedding a few weeks.

01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:39.284
You can't be serious.

01:13:39.327 --> 01:13:41.460
I've been waiting for
this my entire life.

01:13:41.504 --> 01:13:42.809
Are you having second thoughts?

01:13:42.853 --> 01:13:45.377
Of course not, no, no, no.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.553
But you have to admit
this week has been

01:13:47.597 --> 01:13:50.469
pretty horrible with losing
Mrs. Mazurek and Monica.

01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:52.558
Then a stranger attacks you.

01:13:52.602 --> 01:13:53.820
It's Monica, isn't it?

01:13:53.864 --> 01:13:55.431
What? Oh, stop.

01:13:55.474 --> 01:13:57.258
You're still in love with her.

01:13:57.302 --> 01:13:59.739
No, don't be ridiculous.
I saw you two together.

01:13:59.783 --> 01:14:01.001
You saw us?

01:14:01.045 --> 01:14:02.525
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me?

01:14:02.568 --> 01:14:04.483
Because I knew
it would upset you.

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:06.398
Monica was at the bar
with her husband.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.226
She just wanted to give us
her blessing.

01:14:08.269 --> 01:14:10.663
Geez, Helena.
You're acting crazy.

01:14:10.707 --> 01:14:12.448
There's that word again, crazy.

01:14:14.798 --> 01:14:17.540
If you think I'm so crazy,
then why are you marrying me?

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:21.761
He mentioned it again.
He thinks you're crazy.

01:14:21.805 --> 01:14:23.502
He doesn't love you.

01:14:23.546 --> 01:14:25.504
He won't marry you now.

01:14:25.548 --> 01:14:29.552
He's just like all the others.

01:14:29.595 --> 01:14:33.207
And now you're going
to lose Becca, too.

01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:37.429
I was just thinking of you.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:39.518
I don't know why
my sister did this.

01:14:39.562 --> 01:14:40.519
She's the crazy one.

01:14:40.563 --> 01:14:42.782
Don't call Becca crazy!

01:14:42.826 --> 01:14:44.567
She's family

01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:48.135
and family always
sticks together, always.

01:14:48.179 --> 01:14:49.789
I know.
I didn't mean it.

01:14:49.833 --> 01:14:53.184
Yes. Yes, you did.

01:15:09.679 --> 01:15:12.725
What are you saying?
Just say it.

01:15:12.769 --> 01:15:15.206
You murdered my brother.

01:15:16.729 --> 01:15:18.339
He had to be stopped, Glenn.

01:15:18.383 --> 01:15:21.255
It was very disrespectful to me.

01:15:21.299 --> 01:15:23.170
Especially on my wedding day.

01:16:09.347 --> 01:16:13.003
Charlie? Mom? Dad?

01:16:13.046 --> 01:16:15.222
Come on down.

01:16:15.266 --> 01:16:17.790
I have something very
special for you.

01:16:39.203 --> 01:16:40.987
It's a new recipe.

01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:42.989
I've only tried it
a few times before.

01:16:43.033 --> 01:16:45.296
Oh, honey, it's delicious.

01:16:45.339 --> 01:16:47.124
I'm so glad you like it.

01:16:47.167 --> 01:16:49.256
I made it especially
for you guys.

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:51.650
Please, eat up.

01:17:11.801 --> 01:17:13.759
Wow.

01:17:13.803 --> 01:17:17.676
I just suddenly got sleepy.

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.984
Oh, I know what you mean.

01:17:21.027 --> 01:17:22.812
It's been a long day.

01:17:22.855 --> 01:17:26.467
Well, then a good night's
sleep is in order.

01:17:26.511 --> 01:17:31.647
Remember, whatever you two
decide about the wedding...

01:17:34.258 --> 01:17:36.216
We support your decision.

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:38.915
Thanks, Dad.
Goodnight.

01:17:53.712 --> 01:17:55.758
I'm sorry about earlier.

01:17:55.801 --> 01:17:57.411
You're not still mad
at me, are you?

01:17:57.455 --> 01:17:59.675
Oh, of course not.

01:17:59.718 --> 01:18:01.764
You should stay
the night tonight.

01:18:01.807 --> 01:18:03.983
Maybe for just a little bit.

01:18:04.027 --> 01:18:06.594
I do have something
I want to show you.

01:18:35.188 --> 01:18:39.889
Well, what do you think?

01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:44.676
Wow. You look beautiful.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.634
But isn't it unlucky to see
the bride in her dress

01:18:46.678 --> 01:18:48.158
before the wedding?

01:18:48.201 --> 01:18:50.334
It is for you,

01:18:50.377 --> 01:18:53.119
but I just wanted you to see
what you could have had.

01:18:58.255 --> 01:19:00.910
I don't understand.

01:19:00.953 --> 01:19:02.128
I don't feel good.

01:19:02.172 --> 01:19:03.956
I know.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.567
You had one of
my special cupcakes, Charlie.

01:19:06.611 --> 01:19:10.267
Eat too much and it could
make you drowsy and weak.

01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:11.921
You drugged me?

01:19:11.964 --> 01:19:13.531
Why?

01:19:13.574 --> 01:19:16.577
Well, two husbands
with heart attacks

01:19:16.621 --> 01:19:19.929
right before my wedding would
be a little suspicious.

01:19:19.972 --> 01:19:23.628
No, you need to have
an accident.

01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:26.674
Just like Mrs. Mazurek did.

01:19:26.718 --> 01:19:27.893
Helena...

01:19:27.937 --> 01:19:29.547
I gave you everything, Charlie.

01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:31.549
I really did.

01:19:31.592 --> 01:19:34.291
But there was just too many
people like Mrs. Mazurek

01:19:34.334 --> 01:19:37.860
and Monica who wanted
to destroy us.

01:19:37.903 --> 01:19:39.557
It's okay.

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.038
I realized you could
never fully commit.

01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:44.823
You turned on me and Becca.

01:19:44.867 --> 01:19:47.478
And all I ever wanted
was a family

01:19:47.521 --> 01:19:49.262
and the love of a sister.

01:19:56.356 --> 01:20:00.186
Here, let me help you.

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:02.841
I'll take you upstairs.

01:20:09.717 --> 01:20:13.025
Okay, there you go.

01:20:17.247 --> 01:20:19.858
That's a long way down.

01:20:19.902 --> 01:20:22.252
A fall like that
could kill someone.

01:20:24.863 --> 01:20:28.388
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

01:20:41.575 --> 01:20:43.577
Charlie!

01:20:43.621 --> 01:20:46.537
Charlie! Charlie!

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:48.844
Mom! Dad!

01:21:08.515 --> 01:21:10.735
Becca?

01:21:10.778 --> 01:21:12.868
Stay away from me.

01:21:12.911 --> 01:21:16.915
Don't you see?
He turned on us.

01:21:16.959 --> 01:21:19.613
But we don't need anybody else.

01:21:19.657 --> 01:21:22.007
We have each other.

01:21:22.051 --> 01:21:24.444
Where are my parents?

01:21:24.488 --> 01:21:27.056
They're upstairs sleeping.

01:21:27.099 --> 01:21:29.058
But they're not your
real parents, Becca.

01:21:29.101 --> 01:21:30.929
You know that.

01:21:30.973 --> 01:21:33.366
What the hell did you
do to my brother?

01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:35.847
He's not your
real brother either.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.937
You only have one living
blood relative, Becca.

01:21:38.981 --> 01:21:40.721
That's me.

01:21:40.765 --> 01:21:42.985
You are not my sister.

01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:47.467
Do you remember when
I was telling you

01:21:47.511 --> 01:21:49.382
about that surprise earlier?

01:21:49.426 --> 01:21:52.168
I found my birth mother.

01:21:52.211 --> 01:21:54.953
Her name is Nora Packard.

01:21:54.997 --> 01:21:57.695
She had two children
she gave up for adoption..

01:22:01.525 --> 01:22:02.961
Me and you.

01:22:06.617 --> 01:22:10.403
So you see, Becca,
you really are my sister.

01:22:10.447 --> 01:22:11.709
We're blood.

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:17.410
No, you're a liar.
That's not true.

01:22:17.454 --> 01:22:21.937
Oh, but it is.
I came to find you,

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:25.462
and meet your family.

01:22:25.505 --> 01:22:29.466
Your loving mother,
your devoted father.

01:22:29.509 --> 01:22:32.121
Your handsome brother.

01:22:32.164 --> 01:22:34.950
It was everything
I ever dreamed of.

01:22:34.993 --> 01:22:38.127
It's funny how dreams can turn
into such nightmares.

01:22:38.170 --> 01:22:40.738
You need help, Helena.

01:22:40.781 --> 01:22:42.305
Let's get out of here, Becca.

01:22:42.348 --> 01:22:44.176
Just you and me.

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.049
We could start a
whole new life together.

01:22:47.092 --> 01:22:48.093
You're sick.

01:22:50.704 --> 01:22:53.011
In sickness and in health.

01:22:53.055 --> 01:22:55.448
Those vows can be broken.

01:22:55.492 --> 01:23:00.105
But family,
those bonds are true.

01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:01.454
We're pure.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.763
The Dillons are my family.

01:23:05.806 --> 01:23:09.027
This is my home, not yours.

01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:11.508
Don't say that, Becca.

01:23:11.551 --> 01:23:14.815
We only have each other.

01:23:14.859 --> 01:23:16.774
Stop it!

01:23:16.817 --> 01:23:18.515
We need to get you
to a hospital.

01:23:18.558 --> 01:23:21.779
No. You are not taking me
back to a hospital.

01:23:21.822 --> 01:23:23.389
I'm not going back
to a hospital!

01:23:23.433 --> 01:23:24.869
You can't make me go!

01:23:24.912 --> 01:23:27.915
I'm not going back to
a hospital!

01:23:27.959 --> 01:23:30.266
Ah!

01:24:14.397 --> 01:24:15.659
Becca?

01:24:28.802 --> 01:24:30.630
911.
What's your emergency?

01:24:30.674 --> 01:24:34.939
Hi. I need the police
and an ambulance.

01:24:37.028 --> 01:24:38.116
Stand by.

01:25:03.272 --> 01:25:04.838
Hungry?

01:25:04.882 --> 01:25:08.538
Wow.
What a nice surprise!

01:25:08.581 --> 01:25:11.280
We thought you could
use a lunch break.

01:25:11.323 --> 01:25:12.846
What'd you guys get?

01:25:12.890 --> 01:25:14.413
Your favorite sandwiches
from the deli.

01:25:14.457 --> 01:25:15.893
Yes.

01:25:15.936 --> 01:25:17.199
Oh, you don't have
to ask me twice.

01:25:20.027 --> 01:25:21.899
And how is Mr. Carr?

01:25:21.942 --> 01:25:24.728
Recovering. He went back
to Amherst yesterday.

01:25:24.771 --> 01:25:26.469
At least he got some
justice for his brother.

01:25:26.512 --> 01:25:29.515
Becca, I am so sorry.
I should have listened to you.

01:25:29.559 --> 01:25:31.474
Oh, you don't have to apologize.

01:25:31.517 --> 01:25:33.128
I'm just glad everyone's okay.

01:25:33.171 --> 01:25:35.869
I shouldn't have
doubted you either.

01:25:35.913 --> 01:25:38.176
Do you forgive me?
Aw, Mom.

01:25:41.484 --> 01:25:44.878
I love you.

01:25:44.922 --> 01:25:47.185
What's a guy got to do to
get a hammer around here?

01:25:47.229 --> 01:25:49.361
I mean, does anyone here
actually do any work?

01:25:49.405 --> 01:25:51.929
Where have you been?
Hiding out.

01:25:51.972 --> 01:25:53.844
Man, I am so sorry
about everything.

01:25:53.887 --> 01:25:56.803
Make it up to me and
give me your sandwich.

01:25:56.847 --> 01:26:01.373
Well, we just happen
to have one extra.

01:26:01.417 --> 01:26:03.375
Thank you, Mrs. Dillon.

01:26:03.419 --> 01:26:05.203
I wonder what will
happen to Helena?

01:26:05.247 --> 01:26:07.988
She's probably going away
for a long time.

01:26:08.032 --> 01:26:11.514
I almost feel sorry
for the poor girl.

01:26:11.557 --> 01:26:13.168
Let's just hope she gets
the help she needs, Mom.

01:26:19.043 --> 01:26:20.305
Hey, there.

01:26:23.265 --> 01:26:25.267
Thank you, Steven.

01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:27.530
My pleasure.
Looks good today.

01:26:27.573 --> 01:26:30.272
It's ham and cheese
and fruit salad.

01:26:30.315 --> 01:26:31.490
Steven?

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.451
Yeah?

01:26:35.494 --> 01:26:37.801
Do you have
any brothers or sisters?

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:42.371
I have a sister.

01:26:42.414 --> 01:26:45.809
I have a sister, too.

01:26:45.852 --> 01:26:48.812
She's the joy of my life.

01:26:48.855 --> 01:26:51.293
Family means everything to me.

01:26:55.297 --> 01:26:57.777
Have you ever thought
about getting married?

01:26:59.866 --> 01:27:02.652
Sure.

01:27:02.695 --> 01:27:06.743
Maybe one day, you know.

01:27:06.786 --> 01:27:07.744
When I meet the right girl.
