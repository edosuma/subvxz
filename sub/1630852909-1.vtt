WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:09.960
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:19.760 --> 00:21.000
<i>Dear Steffi,</i>

00:21.520 --> 00:24.160
<i>I'll probably already be gone</i>
<i>when you read this.</i>

00:24.680 --> 00:28.280
<i>But I wanted to thank you</i>
<i>for taking me in as part of your family.</i>

00:28.840 --> 00:31.640
<i>I was really happy</i>
<i>with you and your father.</i>

00:31.720 --> 00:33.800
<i>And I've always seen you as a daughter.</i>

00:33.880 --> 00:38.000
<i>I hope you never lose that enthusiasm</i>
<i>and happiness that makes you you.</i>

00:39.080 --> 00:42.080
<i>The last thing I want to say</i>
<i>before saying goodbye is</i>

00:42.160 --> 00:46.480
<i>that Cielo Grande is</i>
<i>much more than a trophy to your father.</i>

00:46.560 --> 00:49.840
<i>A very important part</i>
<i>of your past is hidden there.</i>

00:49.920 --> 00:52.000
<i>I think it's time for you to find it.</i>

00:52.640 --> 00:55.000
<i>Your father never told you</i>
<i>anything about that.</i>

00:55.080 --> 00:57.320
<i>You have to find it yourself.</i>

00:57.400 --> 00:58.920
<i>I'll always love you.</i>

00:59.000 --> 00:59.880
<i>Paula.</i>

01:45.120 --> 01:46.800
-Julián.
-Luz.

01:46.880 --> 01:47.800
Welcome.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.360
How are you?

01:54.880 --> 01:55.800
Team meeting.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.560
You're

01:59.160 --> 02:00.080
different.

02:00.960 --> 02:01.920
I missed you guys.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.080
We missed you too.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.360
Did you see this, Tony?
It's pretty, isn't it?

02:20.760 --> 02:21.600
Yeah.

02:21.680 --> 02:25.000
Come on, Tony.
Where's your adventurous spirit?

02:25.080 --> 02:28.480
-Steffi, Antonio, anything else?
-No, thank you.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.400
I'm done, Sabrina. Thank you.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.560
Excuse me.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.280
Relax.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.600
An old-school romance?

02:41.600 --> 02:44.560
For real?
Who's writing you letters on paper?

02:45.440 --> 02:47.280
Very funny. No one you care about.

02:49.400 --> 02:53.800
Look, you don't need to be so mysterious
just to enter the competition.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.880
-Is this just for a trophy?
-It's not just a trophy.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.520
It's the same competition
my dad won 20 years ago,

03:01.600 --> 03:03.320
and it's very special to me.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.480
You know what, Tony?

03:06.080 --> 03:08.320
Relax and enjoy yourself, okay?

03:18.440 --> 03:20.720
-Luz! Welcome!
-Charly!

03:22.320 --> 03:25.720
-Augusto!
-Luz! Hi.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.240
Luz, Nati's gonna work
with me at the Delta Bar.

03:28.320 --> 03:31.520
Nati, that's great.
Charly's the best boss in the world.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.960
Thanks. Let me take that.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.360
-Do you wakeboard?
-No.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.840
You should try it.
We're not short on water here.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.440
But seriously,
I could give you a beginner class.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.800
We'll have a lot of fun.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.360
Can I have your attention?

03:42.440 --> 03:45.240
As you already know, after 12 years,

03:45.320 --> 03:48.640
the competition is back! Summer Crush!

03:49.960 --> 03:51.680
-Great!
-A welcoming gift.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.680
T-shirts, cool. I like this.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.880
Thank you.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.560
-This is great.
-Luz.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.360
-This is for you.
-A key.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.640
The key.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.920
Your award for perseverance.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.440
Sky Vibes.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.760
Thank you! It's time. I can't believe it.

04:10.840 --> 04:14.440
We're bringing back the competition.
We can bring back the karaoke bar.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.600
Just please don't waste a single peso.
We're drowning in debt.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.240
-Debt?
-Something like that.

04:19.320 --> 04:21.640
We asked the bank
for a loan to renovate Cielo

04:21.720 --> 04:24.360
to relaunch the competition
and promote the place.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.920
Don't worry. We'll make do
even without money.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.280
-Who's in?
-Me, obviously.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.240
Count on me.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.920
I don't know
what you're talking about, but I'm in.

04:33.000 --> 04:33.840
Good, Nati.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.920
-Is Steffi Navarro's suite ready?
-Yes.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.880
Steffi Navarro, here?

04:38.480 --> 04:41.720
She's amazing.
A professional Mexican wakeboarder.

04:41.800 --> 04:44.600
She won three world competitions
and two Moomba Masters.

04:44.680 --> 04:45.600
I'm a huge fan.

04:45.680 --> 04:49.080
Yes, at the moment, Steffi Navarro
is our most important competitor.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.520
Right now, she's the only one
in her category.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.160
Luz, this year
you're gonna share a room with Nati.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.760
Great. It'll be fun.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.160
Sky Vibes, I can't believe it.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.800
Sky Vibes is a karaoke bar?

05:08.880 --> 05:11.560
The karaoke bar.
It was the soul of Cielo Grande.

05:11.640 --> 05:14.000
You might not believe it.
It's a storeroom now.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.960
But this year, it's coming back to life.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.440
I love this song.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.840
-"Urgent Love," isn't it?
-Yes.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.760
It reminds me of my grandparents.
They always used to sing it at Sky Vibes.

05:32.840 --> 05:36.720
<i>That different day</i>

05:36.800 --> 05:38.400
<i>The two of them alone</i>

05:38.480 --> 05:41.000
<i>It was urgent love</i>

05:41.080 --> 05:44.520
<i>The two of them alone, almost alone</i>

05:44.600 --> 05:49.640
<i>Our lips simply like that</i>

05:50.440 --> 05:52.960
I don't know
what you're expecting from this place.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.120
Cielo Grande isn't even on the map.

05:59.480 --> 06:00.640
This is too much.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.680
How are you not even a little bothered?

06:03.760 --> 06:06.000
Waiting a few minutes never hurt anyone.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.120
Please. This is the first time

06:08.200 --> 06:10.840
I've seen you wait ten minutes
without complaining,

06:10.920 --> 06:13.160
and it's only been 22.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.360
Look. They're coming.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.040
-Nice piece of junk.
-Shut up and smile, Tony.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.680
If that's the boat,
what will the hotel be like?

06:22.160 --> 06:23.640
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.720
I'm so sorry for the delay.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.040
We had some mechanical issues
with this old boat.

06:31.800 --> 06:36.400
I'm Charly, the wakeboard instructor,
cafeteria boss, and sometimes chauffeur.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.840
Steffi, Antonio, welcome.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.120
Can we go already?

06:41.640 --> 06:45.080
-This way, please. Careful.
-Thank you, Charly.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.280
<i>I have this feeling</i>

06:58.360 --> 07:00.280
<i>I'm being electrocuted</i>

07:00.960 --> 07:02.480
<i>Time loses distance</i>

07:02.560 --> 07:05.200
<i>I feel all slow</i>

07:05.960 --> 07:08.360
<i>And I lost myself with you</i>

07:08.440 --> 07:10.800
<i>While a song plays</i>

07:10.880 --> 07:15.360
<i>I leave it all</i>
<i>I isolate myself from the world</i>

07:15.960 --> 07:18.360
<i>I feel special</i>

07:18.440 --> 07:21.040
<i>I feel like dancing</i>

07:21.120 --> 07:24.960
<i>And I don't care if I'm on the beat</i>

07:25.760 --> 07:27.920
<i>Loud sigh</i>

07:28.000 --> 07:30.200
<i>Loud sigh</i>

07:30.800 --> 07:32.360
<i>Loud sigh</i>

07:39.400 --> 07:42.360
-You picked that up quickly.
-Because I love it.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.520
We have the same taste in music.
We're gonna get along well.

07:48.480 --> 07:51.160
I've been planning
this trip for a long time.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.160
I've never been so far from home.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.200
And this your first time wakeboarding.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.400
-Ready for your class?
-Now?

07:58.480 --> 08:01.160
-Yes.
-Can we do that later?

08:01.920 --> 08:02.760
Let's go.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.520
-Life vest.
-Okay.

08:07.800 --> 08:08.840
Rope.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.640
-Let's grab the boards.
-Okay.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.920
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.480
All right. Do your best, okay?

08:29.120 --> 08:34.160
ROOM FOR RENT

08:41.800 --> 08:45.920
Remember what we talked about.
It's important to be relaxed in the water.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.600
We'll start slow to get you up.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.440
You're gonna have to do
the movements slowly.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.440
Okay.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.240
-Are you ready?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

08:54.520 --> 08:55.440
Let's go, Saúl

09:06.600 --> 09:07.920
Almost.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.160
I'm confirming your rooms now.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.800
No.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.240
When it comes to passwords,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.440
it's too much to keep that all in my head.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.680
No worries.
We have all the time in the world.

09:31.760 --> 09:32.640
Right, Tony?

09:33.680 --> 09:34.520
Yeah.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.840
Room 301 and 311.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.000
They're ready. I'll give you the keys.

09:41.080 --> 09:45.000
Oh yeah! I need your passports.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.840
Here you go.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.040
Photo.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.120
Photo.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.160
Good.

10:09.720 --> 10:10.800
All right.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.000
Passports.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.360
-Keys.
-Thank you.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.000
Enjoy.

10:17.800 --> 10:22.400
Steffi, I'm Julián. I'm the one
you talked to. Nice to meet you in person.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.960
Nice to meet you, Julián.
Tony, my trainer.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.600
Well, welcome to Cielo Grande.

10:26.680 --> 10:30.280
Follow me. I'll take you to your rooms.
Then Charly will bring your bags.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.960
-Okay.
-Let's go.

10:32.040 --> 10:32.880
Let's go.

10:42.680 --> 10:43.720
BOSS

10:43.800 --> 10:46.160
Squirrel in the trunk.

10:47.000 --> 10:47.840
I repeat.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.160
Squirrel in the trunk.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.640
The room is simple. Nothing luxurious
but almost everything works.

10:58.720 --> 11:02.440
There's a jacuzzi,
but one of the jets isn't working.

11:02.520 --> 11:03.920
I'll fix it today.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.880
This is the best room at Cielo Grande.
The bed is comfortable. You'll see.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.560
But best of all, the view.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.080
Come with me.

11:15.280 --> 11:18.120
We have 24-hour room service.

11:19.080 --> 11:22.560
Actually, until midnight
because there's no one here after.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.800
And breakfast is served
from 7:00 to 10:00 a.m.,

11:26.880 --> 11:30.640
but if you let us know in advance,
we can make an exception. No problem.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.800
Today is the opening ceremony
for wakeboard season.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.520
I'd love it if you guys came.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.560
Whatever you need, I'm at your service.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.280
-Thank you, Julián.
-You're welcome. See you.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.760
<i>Dear Steffi,</i>

12:14.240 --> 12:16.680
<i>I'll probably already be gone</i>
<i>when you read this.</i>

12:17.400 --> 12:20.680
<i>But I wanted to thank you</i>
<i>for taking me in as part of your family.</i>

12:21.920 --> 12:25.800
<i>I hope you never lose that enthusiasm</i>
<i>and happiness that makes you you.</i>

12:26.200 --> 12:32.000
INCOMING CALL

12:32.560 --> 12:35.160
<i>What's up, Steffi?</i>
<i>I've sent you tons of messages.</i>

12:35.240 --> 12:36.640
<i>Have you read them? Steffi?</i>

12:39.040 --> 12:40.040
Can you hear me?

12:40.640 --> 12:43.080
-What's up?
<i>-The heat is unbearable.</i>

12:43.160 --> 12:45.440
And I don't think the AC even works.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.280
What an awful place.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.960
It's not that bad, Tony.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.000
I'm going to the beach.
Everything's ready for training.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.080
See you in the boat.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.120
-See you at the beach in ten.
<i>-Okay.</i>

12:57.200 --> 12:59.560
<i>I think I just got bitten by a mosquito.</i>

13:25.680 --> 13:26.640
Hi.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.960
-Hi.
-Better late than never.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.320
Or we can wait until tomorrow.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.320
Can you help me?

13:35.160 --> 13:36.000
Okay.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.640
-Ready?
-Totally ready.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.080
Perfect.

13:47.320 --> 13:48.960
Good, Steffi!

13:52.600 --> 13:53.440
That's it!

13:55.000 --> 13:56.160
Good landing.

14:01.000 --> 14:01.880
Good, Steffi.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.360
Now that's it.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.040
Perfect! You're having a good day.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.880
Good tricks.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.280
When you do the spins,

14:22.360 --> 14:24.760
don't let the rope
get so far from your body,

14:24.840 --> 14:26.760
especially with the 360s.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.720
Okay, I'll try that right now.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.600
Let's try some basic flips
before finishing up.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.000
Is this good, Luz?

14:38.080 --> 14:40.480
Nati, put pressure on the rope

14:40.560 --> 14:42.480
so you don't swing out wide.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.720
Good, Steffi!

14:47.920 --> 14:49.960
That's incredible. All right.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.000
Like this?

14:55.640 --> 14:58.520
I want to see you flip, Steffi. Ready?

14:58.600 --> 15:01.120
-I can't. I'm opening up.
-Too much.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.720
Careful, Nati! A boat's coming!
Careful. Get closer to me.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.560
No! I'm falling!

15:09.640 --> 15:11.600
Steffi, watch out ahead!

15:11.680 --> 15:12.800
Careful!

15:18.080 --> 15:21.400
Sorry!

15:21.480 --> 15:23.560
-It's my first time.
-Don't worry.

15:23.640 --> 15:27.080
I was so focused on my trick
that I didn't look ahead when I landed.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.880
Are you okay? Let it go.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.320
Tony?

15:32.240 --> 15:33.080
Luz.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.520
For real? What a surprise.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.560
-What are you doing here?
-Me? What are you doing here?

15:49.840 --> 15:53.760
Sorry, this is Steffi,
a Summer Crush competitor.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.240
And I'm her trainer.

15:55.760 --> 15:58.320
Trainer? No way!

15:58.400 --> 16:01.240
Steffi, I watch all your videos.
All of them.

16:01.320 --> 16:05.240
I'm a huge fan of your technique.
Your style is awesome.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.440
Thank you.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.880
Have we met before?

16:09.720 --> 16:11.600
No, we haven't.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.240
You must remind me of someone then.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.560
All right, see you later, Luz.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.320
We have to keep going.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.160
Come on, Steffi.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.720
Let's go.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.440
Ready.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.800
You guys go and I'll get your equipment.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.040
-Thanks so much.
-It's nothing.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.840
Ian, stop that.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.600
<i>Now's not the time. Ian!</i>

16:53.680 --> 16:55.360
Ian, you're playing with fire.

16:55.440 --> 16:58.800
Remember that game console
you wanted? I'm changing my mind now.

17:04.760 --> 17:08.840
Stop joking, Dad. I just wanted you
to have some adventure on your vacation.

17:08.920 --> 17:12.080
Now the adventure will be
figuring out how to get that console.

17:12.160 --> 17:15.160
When I get my first million dollars,
that won't be a problem.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.360
I don't know where you get that idea,
but when you manage that,

17:18.440 --> 17:19.760
consoles will be obsolete.

17:19.840 --> 17:22.680
But I already have 1,000 views
a month on my channel.

17:22.760 --> 17:26.360
And I get ten cents
for each view. You get the idea.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.800
The idea is
that you study and get a real job.

17:29.880 --> 17:30.840
No. Listen.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.320
Once you get 1,000 views per month,
your earnings multiply by 1,000.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.000
I calculated it
with the new monetization algorithm.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.440
-In three years, I'll reach my goal.
-"Monetization algorithm"?

17:40.520 --> 17:43.040
Right now, you depend on me.
Let's go check in.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.080
Wait. I'm not done.

17:44.160 --> 17:47.080
I'm sure you're asking yourself
how I'll grow my channel.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.640
Easy! Collabs with other YouTubers,

17:49.720 --> 17:52.120
putting up videos,
and analyzing the algorithm.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.000
I practically have the million.

17:55.120 --> 17:55.960
Dad!

18:03.680 --> 18:06.000
-Are you sure you're not hurt?
-I'm sure.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.440
-The only thing hurt is my dignity.
-No. It shouldn't be.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.560
You invented a new technique.
The starfish.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.000
You reacted well, and that's what counts.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.680
-How so?
-You handled it well.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.480
In the face of fear
and danger, you let go of the rope.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.360
Would Steffi agree?

18:28.280 --> 18:31.120
-Have you been wakeboarding long?
-Since I was little.

18:31.200 --> 18:35.240
I first learned to water-ski here
because my grandparents were instructors.

18:35.760 --> 18:37.760
And then I learned to wakeboard.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.360
You're a great teacher.
You made me forget my fear.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.440
Except when my students
crash into other wakeboarders.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.480
But yeah. I like teaching.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.040
-How did you end up here?
-I wanted something different.

18:51.280 --> 18:54.400
I came to work,
save money, and be on vacation.

18:55.120 --> 18:58.200
And to meet someone special?

18:58.280 --> 18:59.800
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

18:59.880 --> 19:02.960
-Perhaps.
-I think so.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.600
I'll need your passports.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.960
-Here they are.
-Thank you.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.360
Hi. Welcome.

19:23.880 --> 19:27.080
-I'm Augusto Montero, the hotel manager.
-Nice to meet you.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.400
-How was your trip?
-Great. Thank you.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.800
Ron Lavalle. This is my son, Ian.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.800
First time at Cielo Grande?

19:34.880 --> 19:37.880
No, but it's been a long time.
I barely recognize the place.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.720
I thought I recognized you.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.200
Surely we've crossed paths here before.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.480
Your keys.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.640
The Monzo Twins are arriving tomorrow.
Do you know them?

19:47.720 --> 19:50.720
Perfect. "Without You" got
over 100,000 views in a few hours.

19:50.960 --> 19:55.480
<i>Without you, I can't go on</i>
<i>A little longer, and you'll forget me</i>

19:55.560 --> 19:57.480
Nice. Now you're gonna meet them.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.400
-A little closer to my first million.
-Who are they?

20:00.480 --> 20:03.200
The coolest twins
on the planet. My plan is perfect.

20:03.280 --> 20:05.400
-Wanna see their videos?
-Maybe later.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.080
Well, enjoy the place.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.520
-Make yourselves at home.
-Thanks. Very kind.

20:23.560 --> 20:24.520
Great!

20:26.520 --> 20:27.560
No!

20:29.640 --> 20:31.080
Great, Nati!

20:33.080 --> 20:35.160
Well done, Nati!

20:43.000 --> 20:46.600
I finally found the lights, Augusto.
They were in the storeroom.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.480
Leave them there. I'll handle it.

20:48.560 --> 20:49.480
Perfect.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.840
I'm gonna go. I better go pick up
the competitor from Brazil.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.280
-He's not coming.
-What do you mean?

20:55.360 --> 20:57.560
What about the competitors from Rosario?

20:58.520 --> 20:59.960
And the Chileans?

21:01.080 --> 21:02.600
Anyway, we're not giving up.

21:02.680 --> 21:05.560
No problem if we're short
on competitors. You guys'll go.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.920
No. I don't understand, Augusto.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.600
If we're the only participants,
won't Cielo Grande lose money?

21:11.680 --> 21:13.240
And we'll lose our jobs.

21:18.120 --> 21:20.400
-Well done, Nati. Congrats.
-Thanks.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.520
You know what?
Wakeboarding is pretty easy.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.280
-Water-skiing could be your thing.
-Excuse me?

21:26.360 --> 21:28.600
Water-skiing is better
than wakeboarding? No.

21:28.680 --> 21:31.760
We're all right without your help.
Thanks. We don't need you.

21:31.840 --> 21:35.880
<i>Luz, it's Charly, the coolest boy</i>
<i>at Cielo Grande. Do you read me?</i>

21:36.880 --> 21:39.560
Hello, coolest boy. Yes, I read you.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.320
<i>We've been left high and dry.</i>
<i>We need reinforcements.</i>

21:42.400 --> 21:44.720
<i>We're almost out of drinks</i>
<i>at the Delta Bar.</i>

21:44.800 --> 21:47.720
Okay, we're finishing up the orientation.
We're coming.

21:47.800 --> 21:48.760
-Shall we?
-Let's.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.440
-I'll join you.
-Okay.

21:50.520 --> 21:51.560
Wait!

21:51.640 --> 21:53.120
Selfie and then Sky Vibes?

21:53.200 --> 21:55.400
Okay, but I think you mean "storeroom."

21:55.480 --> 21:59.680
Nati, did you know
they say the storeroom is full of ghosts?

22:05.040 --> 22:05.880
Look.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.400
-Ian Tech.
-That's it. Ian Tech.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.640
-Ian Tech.
-Excellent.

22:13.720 --> 22:14.960
-Ian Tech.
-One more.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.920
-Ian Tech.
-There you go.

22:17.000 --> 22:17.920
How'd it turn out?

22:18.000 --> 22:20.280
Please, you're talking to a professional.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.760
Look how the new intro
for your show turned out.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.680
-The intro for my channel.
-The intro for your channel.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.480
Look, Steffi.

22:38.840 --> 22:39.680
Come on.

22:50.520 --> 22:53.520
What are you doing here, Dad?
You show up without telling me.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.160
You know I don't like you around
when I'm competing.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.080
But Steffi…

22:58.640 --> 22:59.920
I told you, Dad.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.520
This'll blow over by tomorrow.
She wasn't expecting us.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.160
This is Sky Vibes?

23:18.480 --> 23:21.080
This is gonna be Sky Vibes.

23:24.600 --> 23:25.440
Shall we?

23:43.200 --> 23:45.320
Didn't I tell you there were ghosts?

23:50.240 --> 23:53.560
-Welcome to Sky Vibes, Nati.
-Thanks.

23:54.640 --> 23:56.960
This is gonna be impossible, Luz.

23:57.040 --> 24:01.280
Come on, Charly. Stop exaggerating.
It'll only take a few days to fix up.

24:02.880 --> 24:05.000
No! Look at this.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.120
Look, Nati.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.960
-Let's see.
-This was Sky Vibes.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.800
I remember I was the worst at karaoke.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.480
-You weren't so bad.
-Do you remember "Trapped"?

24:20.000 --> 24:23.600
<i>Today I found myself talking softly</i>

24:24.200 --> 24:27.600
<i>Without understanding myself</i>
<i>Alone, so alone</i>

24:28.360 --> 24:31.600
<i>It's that, lying, I come to say</i>

24:32.400 --> 24:35.320
<i>Being together, I want to continue</i>

24:36.440 --> 24:40.680
<i>While you were talking to me</i>
<i>I presented it</i>

24:40.760 --> 24:44.600
<i>We got along, I turned to lying</i>

24:45.240 --> 24:49.000
<i>Within a sigh, I convinced myself</i>

24:49.520 --> 24:53.400
<i>I'm fooling myself, I come back for you</i>

24:53.480 --> 24:54.320
<i>Trapped</i>

24:55.040 --> 24:56.840
<i>I see it clearly</i>

24:56.920 --> 25:01.160
<i>It's all in my head</i>

25:01.240 --> 25:05.360
<i>I don't feel strength if you bring me</i>

25:05.440 --> 25:09.800
<i>I can't go out alone</i>

25:09.880 --> 25:11.880
<i>I go over it a thousand times</i>

25:11.960 --> 25:13.720
<i>I look for potions</i>

25:13.800 --> 25:17.920
<i>But I don't find solutions</i>

25:18.000 --> 25:20.120
<i>Trapped</i>

25:20.200 --> 25:22.240
<i>I see it clearly</i>

25:22.320 --> 25:26.360
<i>It's all in my head</i>

25:27.160 --> 25:29.080
<i>I know your love has put a spell on me</i>

25:29.160 --> 25:31.440
<i>It's not a memory, it's an illusion</i>

25:31.520 --> 25:33.200
<i>That's how I fooled myself</i>

25:33.280 --> 25:35.480
<i>And I go back to living</i>

25:35.560 --> 25:37.600
<i>I know your love has put a spell on me</i>

25:37.680 --> 25:39.800
<i>It's not a memory, it's an illusion</i>

25:39.880 --> 25:42.000
<i>That's how I fooled you</i>

25:42.080 --> 25:43.680
<i>I go back to lying to you</i>

25:43.760 --> 25:45.520
<i>Trapped</i>

25:45.600 --> 25:47.080
<i>I see it clearly</i>

25:47.680 --> 25:51.760
<i>It's all in my head</i>

25:51.840 --> 25:55.880
<i>I don't feel strength if you bring me</i>

25:55.960 --> 26:00.360
<i>I can't go out alone</i>

26:00.440 --> 26:02.320
<i>I go over it a thousand times</i>

26:02.400 --> 26:08.240
<i>I look for potions</i>
<i>But I don't find solutions</i>

26:08.840 --> 26:10.640
<i>Trapped</i>

26:10.720 --> 26:12.960
<i>I see it clearly</i>

26:13.040 --> 26:16.640
<i>It's all in my head</i>

26:22.720 --> 26:24.560
Charly, that rap was awesome.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.800
-That was great.
-Thanks, guys.

26:28.560 --> 26:30.480
So this is where you hide out.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.240
This storeroom has history.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.800
Come. I'll show you
what Sky Vibes will be like.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.240
A stage will be here.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.440
The bar will be over there.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.360
And in this area
will be tables for the audience.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.040
Look. This was Sky Vibes.

26:48.160 --> 26:49.480
This was Sky Vibes?

26:54.360 --> 26:55.200
Luz.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.960
-We should go. Shall we?
-Yeah.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.800
-What can I help you with?
-The box.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.080
One for Nati and one for you.

27:12.520 --> 27:13.520
Let's go, Tony.

27:14.520 --> 27:15.560
Yeah, let's go.

27:22.320 --> 27:25.400
Can you tell me what you're doing here
on my vacation, Dad?

27:25.480 --> 27:27.800
-I can't believe it.
-I told you, Steffi.

27:27.880 --> 27:31.120
Ian insisted. We wanted to see
you compete, and you never let us.

27:31.200 --> 27:34.400
-Don't involve Ian in this.
-Dad misses you when you're gone.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.440
We wanted to surprise you.
You know I never do this.

27:38.520 --> 27:41.480
This is the first time.
Plus, I thought it would be fun.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.320
We used your grandma's last name
so you wouldn't know.

27:44.400 --> 27:47.040
And it didn't occur to you
to ask me what I wanted?

27:47.120 --> 27:50.440
Or warn me at least?
I don't get what you're trying to do.

27:50.520 --> 27:51.640
Definitely not this.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.800
And you're lying too.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.800
This is my trip, Dad,
not a family vacation.

27:56.880 --> 27:59.720
And you know that.
I can't believe you're doing this.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.200
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.960
I thought you'd like us here
supporting you.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.240
Leave tomorrow or I will.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.320
But I'm staying.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.840
This is for table three. All right.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.400
Luz.

28:28.680 --> 28:29.520
You're the same.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.360
You too.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.200
Antonio, how was the first day?

28:36.240 --> 28:37.680
Better than I expected.

28:39.120 --> 28:43.040
I was thinking
maybe Luz could be our guide.

28:44.560 --> 28:45.400
My classes.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.400
Charly and Julián can cover for you.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.560
I really appreciate it.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.320
Thanks, Luz.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.480
Luz.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.960
Give it your all for Steffi.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.520
