[Helicopter blades whirring]
Man:  The backup is for miles.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.379
Again, they're saying...
Mm. Captain Phil --

00:11.412 --> 00:12.380
that's a great gig.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.981
All those beautiful vistas.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.983
I mean, the 405,
it's a majestic river.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.651
You know,
it's the Nile of SoCal.

00:17.685 --> 00:18.952
It's a parking lot.

00:18.986 --> 00:20.754
Well, Captain Phil said
that there was

00:20.788 --> 00:24.158
a fatal accident on
the 110 interchange, so...

00:24.192 --> 00:27.061
How long has Captain Phil
been doing the local news?

00:27.095 --> 00:28.662
Uh, I don't know.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.698
Longer than
we've been alive.

00:30.731 --> 00:34.168
Captain Phil's
seen it all.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.503
You know, when Mom died,

00:35.536 --> 00:37.605
it must've cause
horrible traffic on the 710.

00:38.672 --> 00:42.076
I bet Captain Phil
reported on that.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.344
Jesus, Liz.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.545
What?
I'm just saying.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.180
Somewhere in
the Channel 6 archives,

00:46.214 --> 00:48.516
there's a traffic report,
and it's about Mom.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.817
Yeah, okay.

00:49.850 --> 00:54.355
Liz, I'm kind of worried
about you, you know?

00:54.388 --> 00:55.589
Yeah, me too, baby.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.091
Uh, don't call me "baby."

00:57.125 --> 00:59.193
It makes me want
to puke on your face.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.795
Yeah, Bobby.
Stay out of it.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.697
When's he gonna leave,
alright?

01:03.731 --> 01:05.733
He keeps using up
all the hot water.

01:05.766 --> 01:09.137
I need to get the full effect
of my body wash.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.805
It's made from seaweed.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.308
Well, I should go get
in traffic.

01:14.342 --> 01:16.910
I don't want to miss a minute
with Dr. Kimbrough.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.546
If the job's
getting you down,

01:18.579 --> 01:20.248
don't be afraid to talk to Ross,
okay?

01:20.281 --> 01:22.583
You need to be climbing
the corporate ladder.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.785
Mm. No. I did that.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.020
Now I'm just
sliding down the chute.

01:27.054 --> 01:30.258
Liz: And you know what?
It's kind of fun.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.426
[Sighs]
What's your plan?

01:32.460 --> 01:34.562
How are you gonna
lug all this around?

01:34.595 --> 01:36.264
Oh, um, Ernie.

01:36.297 --> 01:38.899
Yeah, he was kind of an asshole
to me the other night,

01:38.932 --> 01:41.034
and he asked if he could do
anything to make up for it,

01:41.068 --> 01:43.337
so he's gonna drive me around
to my huntin' grounds.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.972
Uh-huh.
And then what?

01:45.005 --> 01:48.276
Then, um,
I knock on people's doors,

01:48.309 --> 01:50.378
and I say,

01:50.411 --> 01:51.745
"I'll clean your pool

01:51.779 --> 01:53.481
cheaper than
those Pool Party dickheads."

01:53.514 --> 01:54.615
And then they say,
"Okay!"

01:54.648 --> 01:56.083
You know?

01:56.116 --> 01:57.618
It's just, like, you know,
basic economics, Liz.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.819
You set the price,

01:58.852 --> 02:00.454
let the invisible hand
of the market

02:00.488 --> 02:01.522
tickle their balls.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.291
Bobby:
Hey, baby, listen.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.926
I'm gonna make you
a vegetable stir-fry tonight --

02:05.959 --> 02:07.395
lots of little colors
in there.

Hey, uh, I really appreciate
you giving me a ride.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.768
You know, between this
and my shark money,

03:20.801 --> 03:22.370
you know, I should be able
to get my car back

03:22.403 --> 03:25.072
pretty soon.

03:25.105 --> 03:28.609
So, you're just
knocking on doors, huh?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.878
Cold-calling.
Man, it's brutal.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.079
[Scoffs]
Tell me about it.

03:32.112 --> 03:33.714
I mean, I never really
had to deal

03:33.747 --> 03:35.549
with this part of the business,
you know?

03:35.583 --> 03:37.985
My dad
always took care of it.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.954
Or...didn't.

Hey,
you got any sales advice?

03:44.758 --> 03:46.460
[Laughing] I'm not the guy
you should be asking.

03:46.494 --> 03:49.530
I'm not exactly setting
the world on fire right now.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.632
What are you talk--
You're Ernie!

03:51.665 --> 03:53.434
You're made of fire!
Okay?

03:53.467 --> 03:54.568
Don't worry.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.036
You're gonna be alright.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.708
One thing.
Mm?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.743
If you have to ask
for a sale,

04:02.776 --> 04:04.111
it's probably too late.

04:04.144 --> 04:08.416
So just go there
to be there,

04:08.449 --> 04:10.183
if that makes sense.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.319
Go there to be there.

you were in.

a few days off.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.504
Hey, listen.
I've been thinking.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.239
We shouldn't get square
with London.

We should exceed
their expectations.

[Chuckling] Um, well,
that's a very noble goal.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.647
But it'd be
a bit of a challenge,

to do it.

in mind?

Yet.

Th-There's a guy, uh,
at the Lakewood on-ramp.

He actually lives in
a beautiful house in Belmont.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.510
I know that for a fact.
Uh-huh.

Sorry. I didn't really
have time to get into that.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.118
I spent the last couple nights
out with Clara.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.087
You two are becoming
thick as thieves.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.923
It's nice to have
a normal conversation

10:22.956 --> 10:24.191
with someone.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.459
Not this isn't lovely.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.762
Reciting poems in a basement.
Blindfolded.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.130
With you.
Whoever you are.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.666
How do you know
this is the basement?

10:32.700 --> 10:34.534
What?

10:34.567 --> 10:36.169
You don't have to keep
coming here.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.404
You said you were serious

10:37.437 --> 10:38.939
about getting over
your writer's block.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.574
I am.
But this isn't helping.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.811
That's because writer's block
is a symptom,

10:43.844 --> 10:45.378
not the problem itself.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.780
This is a threshold moment,

10:46.814 --> 10:49.082
and soon you'll have to confront
the real thing.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.517
Confront what?

10:50.550 --> 10:52.652
Could you at least try to be
a little more clearer?

10:52.686 --> 10:55.422
Come back
in a few days.
Ugh!

10:58.859 --> 11:00.828
So, what do I owe you?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.162
Forget it.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.865
There's no charge.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.233
And I'll clean your pool
for free

11:06.266 --> 11:08.101
if you let me come back
next week.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.504
You bet.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.539
[Chuckles]

11:12.572 --> 11:15.042
Great.
Thank you, Mr. Dwyer.

11:15.075 --> 11:17.177
Can I give you some lemons,
at least?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.281
Ernie: Hey, Speedy, you got
any of those warranty sheets

11:21.314 --> 11:22.850
for Dawson ball cocks?

11:22.883 --> 11:24.684
I got more defectives.

11:24.718 --> 11:25.919
Bob: Hey, Ernie!

11:25.953 --> 11:27.888
Beautiful Jeff
played paintball

11:27.921 --> 11:29.857
with the guys
from Tento Pipe.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.291
Nine confirmed kills,

11:31.324 --> 11:32.993
and he brought
in a big order.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.963
Beautiful Jeff:
You want to know how you
close a deal, Ernie?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.330
You put a gun
in a man's mouth,

11:37.364 --> 11:38.999
and you make him
beg for his life.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.734
Hold on. Did you actually
do that to Walt?

11:40.768 --> 11:42.169
No.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.004
But after the game,
we went over our pricing,

11:44.037 --> 11:45.405
and I got him
what he wanted.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.807
So, pretty much
the same thing.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.641
[Laughs]

11:48.675 --> 11:50.110
Ernie!

11:52.045 --> 11:54.381
I'm playing golf
with Doug Fife tomorrow.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.317
I got intel that he wants
to drop his toilet line.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.986
[Sighs]
I think we can pounce.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.955
So, why don't you
join us?

12:01.989 --> 12:03.590
Okay. Sure.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.862
You remember Dave Dixon?

12:08.896 --> 12:10.831
Dave "The Dick" Dixon.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.065
Sure.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.633
May he rest in peace.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.169
He gave me
some good advice once.

12:16.203 --> 12:19.439
He said,
"Keep the shit in the shit pipes

12:19.472 --> 12:21.608
and the water
in the water pipes."

12:21.641 --> 12:23.911
Yeah, that's the key
to plumbing.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.313
And the basis
of civilization.
No, no.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.514
What he meant was,

12:27.547 --> 12:29.682
if you've got
personal problems,

12:29.716 --> 12:32.585
flush 'em down
so you can do your job.

12:32.619 --> 12:35.688
That's why, before he left
the house every morning,

12:35.722 --> 12:39.860
he would say to himself,
"Life is good."

12:39.893 --> 12:42.662
No matter what's going on,
you say it,

12:42.695 --> 12:44.631
and then you believe it.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.934
Dave was divorced
four times.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.069
And he lost custody
of his kids.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.873
But he always hit
his sales targets.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.810
Huh.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.045
Life is good?

12:58.078 --> 13:01.148
Life is good.

13:01.181 --> 13:06.753
Life...is...good.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.856
Life is good!

13:08.889 --> 13:10.223
Life is  good!

13:10.257 --> 13:11.758
Life  is  good!

13:11.791 --> 13:14.661
Life...is...good!

13:14.694 --> 13:16.696
Life is goooood!

13:16.729 --> 13:18.698
Life  is..

13:18.731 --> 13:20.167
Good!
Good!

13:23.736 --> 13:25.405
Man #1: Let's go, sir.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.074
Man #2:
Don't make this hard.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.376
Dr. Kimbrough:
Please. Please.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.878
Oh, God. God.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.545
I-I really --
I don't deserve this.

13:32.579 --> 13:36.316
I'll tell you what --
I am the victim of lies.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.585
I am being framed.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.153
Liz! Liz!

13:40.187 --> 13:41.554
Liz, call my mother.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.323
Tell her
what you see here.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.092
Describe it.
Describe it.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.526
Tell her
about my suffering.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.095
[Groans]

13:48.128 --> 13:49.629
[Engine starts,
car door shuts]

13:49.662 --> 13:56.236
**

13:56.269 --> 13:58.305
Liz:
What am I supposed to do?

13:58.338 --> 13:59.873
I don't have
any cash on me.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.241
Yeah, me neither.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.475
Royal decree.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.511
Cash only till you pay
your bar tab.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.279
I don't have three grand
lying around.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.981
Whoa. Really?

14:08.015 --> 14:09.282
Three grand?

14:09.316 --> 14:11.451
I like
buying people drinks.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.420
It builds community.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.855
Is that a sin?

14:15.889 --> 14:20.460
Can I get a drink
for one fresh lemon?

14:21.228 --> 14:22.662
That seems fair.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.697
Yeah. Yeah!

14:24.731 --> 14:26.733
And I'd like to, uh,
buy a drink for Anita.

14:26.766 --> 14:27.767
Mm!

14:27.800 --> 14:30.570
And, uh, gentlemen --
buy you a drink?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.705
Right on, man.
I owe you one lemon.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.674
[Clears throat]
Hi, Dud.
Oh, hey!

14:34.707 --> 14:36.476
Everybody,
I'd like to introduce you

14:36.509 --> 14:37.444
to my legal counsel.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.246
This is Daphne.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.214
Hello, and welcome.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.215
Thanks, Blaise.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.516
Uh...

14:43.550 --> 14:45.585
how did you know my name?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.722
Your picture's on the wall
in the lobby.

14:49.756 --> 14:52.825
Oh, right.

14:52.859 --> 14:53.826
[Chuckles]

14:53.860 --> 14:55.528
Yeah, Daphne's gonna be
helping me

14:55.562 --> 14:57.597
obtain financial justice
for my shark attack,

14:57.630 --> 14:59.933
so she's gonna be taking
depositions from everybody.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.168
Should we get started?

15:01.201 --> 15:02.269
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Blaise.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.470
Just buy everybody
a drink.

15:03.503 --> 15:04.972
Let's get the night going,
huh?

15:05.005 --> 15:06.139
You got it.

15:06.173 --> 15:09.409
[Laughs]
Man, this feels good.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.912
Oh, hold it. Hold it.
No, no, no.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.248
We are not exchanging lemons
for drinks.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.716
Big Ben: Too late.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.319
We're on
the lemon standard now.
Mm-hmm.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.587
[Sighs]

15:20.620 --> 15:22.555
Blaise,
if you're gonna tend bar,

15:22.589 --> 15:24.791
you have got to enforce
the rules.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.394
Otherwise,
it'll be chaos.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.497
Then maybe
I shouldn't tend bar.

15:30.530 --> 15:34.301
I'm not gonna be your goon,
Scott.

15:36.336 --> 15:38.338
Which, of course,
brings us to

15:38.371 --> 15:41.074
Carcharodon carcharias,
okay?

15:41.108 --> 15:42.875
Which is the scientific name
for the animal --

15:42.909 --> 15:44.477
well, th-the perpetrator
in this case,

15:44.511 --> 15:45.478
I guess, right?

15:45.512 --> 15:47.480
Um, the -- I'm sorry.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.715
Shouldn't you be
writing this down

15:48.748 --> 15:49.983
on, like,
a legal pad or...?

15:50.017 --> 15:51.151
You mentioned
Larry Loomis.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.885
I did?

15:52.919 --> 15:55.155
Tell me about
your relationship.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.356
His hobbies.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.691
Did he enjoy traveling?

15:58.725 --> 16:01.494
Did he have any trips booked
before he died,

16:01.528 --> 16:03.630
to Mexico
or somewhere like that?

16:03.663 --> 16:06.099
And where in Mexico,
if that was the case?

16:06.133 --> 16:07.834
Um...

16:07.867 --> 16:12.205
Sorry. How do you know
that Larry died?

16:12.239 --> 16:14.341
I read his obituary
in the paper.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.476
I do deep background,
Dud.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.977
That's why
I've never lost a case.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.246
Trust me.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.314
We need to show
your state of mind

16:21.348 --> 16:22.649
in the days
leading up to the attack.

16:22.682 --> 16:26.053
The more we highlight
your emotional turmoil,

16:26.086 --> 16:28.121
the bigger the settlement.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.290
Mm.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.592
I guess that makes sense.

16:32.625 --> 16:37.230
So, you're basically
cleaning pools for free.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.398
Yeah.

16:38.431 --> 16:39.899
And it works.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.934
Picked up
six new clients today.

16:41.968 --> 16:42.969
[Chuckles]

16:43.002 --> 16:44.671
I know it can't last,
obviously,

16:44.704 --> 16:46.373
but it felt good
to be out there.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.575
Yeah, yeah!
You're back in business.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.977
Yeah!
Life is good.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.545
Yeah, life is good.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.214
That's my new motto.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.449
Life is good.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.251
Well, you know what?

16:58.285 --> 17:00.053
It's my new motto now,
too.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.155
[Laughing]
Life is good!

17:02.189 --> 17:03.423
[Laughs]

17:03.456 --> 17:06.159
Life...is...good.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.827
[Laughs] Aww.
[Chuckles]

17:07.860 --> 17:10.163
Man, it's really great
to have you back, Ernie.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.898
I mean...

17:11.931 --> 17:13.566
if we had drinks,

17:13.600 --> 17:15.902
we could toast
to the goodness of life,

17:15.935 --> 17:19.038
but that's not
happening tonight.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.544
Jocelyn: Scott.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.746
[Inhales deeply]

17:26.779 --> 17:30.150
I fear the, uh, mood
in the tavern

17:30.183 --> 17:32.752
has curdled somewhat

17:32.785 --> 17:35.122
since we instituted
the new policy.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.191
People have to learn.

17:38.225 --> 17:41.561
Actions
have consequences.

17:41.594 --> 17:45.398
People have to learn.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.772
Dud:
You know, it's just...

17:52.805 --> 17:54.341
It's hard seeing Ernie
just sitting back

17:54.374 --> 17:56.209
watching
Scott's reign of terror.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.145
Blaise:
[Scoffing] Scott.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.479
I'd say let's revolt,

17:59.512 --> 18:01.648
but historically,
whenever there's a coup,

18:01.681 --> 18:04.584
it leads inevitably to
a violent counterrevolution,

18:04.617 --> 18:06.553
and I just don't
have the time.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.920
This is my citadel.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.457
As long as he stays out of here,
we'll be fine.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.826
God. Larry's mom.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.929
Looks like she knows things,
you know?

18:16.963 --> 18:18.565
I think she was just
along for the ride.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.700
Smith is the mastermind.
Yeah.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.402
Hey, how do you think
Wallace Smith

18:22.435 --> 18:23.870
sealed himself inside here

18:23.903 --> 18:26.005
without anybody else
noticing?
I don't know.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.474
This room
had to have been part

18:27.507 --> 18:28.775
of the original plans
for the building,

18:28.808 --> 18:30.042
but nobody seemed
to know about it.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.711
I'm trying to find
the architect.

18:33.213 --> 18:37.049
Think there are
any other hidden rooms?

18:37.083 --> 18:38.518
Anything is possible.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.954
Anything is possible.

18:41.988 --> 18:46.593
Life is good,
and anything is possible!

18:46.626 --> 18:48.428
You know, I'm --
I'm feeling that, too.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.730
[Laughs]
Yeah!

18:50.763 --> 18:52.232
Merrill said that,
every generation,

18:52.265 --> 18:54.201
only a couple people
complete the Magnum Opus.

18:54.234 --> 18:59.672
Now, this might sound like
the height of hubris, but...

18:59.706 --> 19:01.608
I think I might be
one of 'em.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.543
Because you are, man!

19:03.576 --> 19:05.178
I wore a hair shirt
in the seminary.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.647
Yes! You wore a hair sh--
What's a hair shirt?

19:07.680 --> 19:09.449
Basically,
a medieval jockstrap

19:09.482 --> 19:11.384
made out of
super scratchy sackcloth

19:11.418 --> 19:12.585
that digs into your skin

19:12.619 --> 19:14.454
and lacerates your genitals
24/7.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.655
Whoa. That's cr--

19:15.688 --> 19:17.224
Uh, do they make you
do that?

19:17.257 --> 19:19.259
Oh, God, no!
No. My choice.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.760
Oh.
Yeah.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.495
My spiritual adviser
thought I was nuts,

19:22.529 --> 19:23.830
but I had read about
these saints

19:23.863 --> 19:25.465
that experienced ecstasy
in the pain.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.699
So I thought
I'd give it a try,

19:26.733 --> 19:29.302
but I found out
pain is not my thing.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.303
Eh.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.339
At all.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.842
But ecstasy...

19:35.875 --> 19:40.713
To experience a moment
beyond time,

19:40.747 --> 19:43.283
to see behind
the appearance of things --

19:43.316 --> 19:46.018
that, I think, is what
the Magnum Opus is all about.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.420
Yeah!

19:47.454 --> 19:50.056
To get back time.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.525
The impossible dream.

19:52.559 --> 19:56.128
The impossible dream.

19:56.162 --> 19:59.999
I cannot believe
that you get a car

20:00.032 --> 20:02.335
and an expense account
at a temp assignment.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.504
Mm-hmm.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.806
Ah! It's the cost of
doing business, brother.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.308
If you want
the best people,

20:08.341 --> 20:10.277
you have to give them
incentives.
Yeah.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.345
And I'm worth it.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.046
You're totally worth it,
baby.

20:14.080 --> 20:14.981
[Sighs]

20:15.014 --> 20:16.115
How was your day?
It was --

20:16.148 --> 20:17.550
I worked out
in the morning,

20:17.584 --> 20:19.852
then just kind of
[clicks tongue] chilled.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.321
Mm.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.323
My day was great.
Yeah.

20:23.356 --> 20:26.092
Felt really good to be
back in the swing.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.860
Was your leg okay?
Yeah! Yeah.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.962
I mean, it hurt a little bit,
you know,

20:29.996 --> 20:31.564
but nothing
I can't handle.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.733
Pain is just weakness
leaving the body.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.503
[Grunts, sighs]

20:36.969 --> 20:38.738
Oh, and, uh,
I asked Daphne

20:38.771 --> 20:41.341
if she needed you to come in
for the deposition.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.209
She said she's got
everything she needs,

20:43.242 --> 20:46.346
so you are off the hook.

20:46.379 --> 20:49.616
Okay. I still don't really get
who she's going to sue.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.017
Oh. [Scoffs]

20:51.050 --> 20:54.020
Multiple jurisdictions
and agencies involved.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.389
I mean, it's really
very complex.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.690
So that's why I'm --

20:57.724 --> 20:59.559
I'm lucky to have an experienced
law provider.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.761
[Laughing]
Who is this kook?

21:01.794 --> 21:03.195
And why's he talking
to all these losers?

21:03.229 --> 21:04.130
Ohh...

21:04.163 --> 21:06.098
What?!
A-Are you serious?

21:06.132 --> 21:07.534
Do the words
"California's Gold"

21:07.567 --> 21:08.735
mean nothing to you?

21:08.768 --> 21:10.670
Huell Howser!
The man!

21:10.703 --> 21:12.505
This is
why we broke up.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.307
And because he --
he cheated on you,
which was --

21:14.341 --> 21:15.842
I didn't cheat.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.510
I met my soul mate.
What?

21:17.544 --> 21:18.911
[Laughs]
That's not cheating.

21:18.945 --> 21:19.979
Whoa.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.448
Uh, you also said
I was your soul mate.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.716
That's why you got that lizard
tattooed on your heart.

21:23.750 --> 21:27.053
I'm lucky to have
many soul mates.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.588
Hey.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.222
You get me.

21:30.256 --> 21:31.791
But so does Karina.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.726
That's why we're engaged.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.363
So, wait, now you're
cheating on your fiancée?

21:36.396 --> 21:38.431
It's all one soul,
Dud.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.932
Ugh. Puh.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.368
Karina understands that.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.069
That's why our marriage
is going to work.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.537
You know,
she does Krav Maga.

21:44.571 --> 21:45.738
I do capoeira.

21:45.772 --> 21:49.008
We're gonna unite
our disciplines.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.513
[Sighs]

21:53.546 --> 21:57.650
I cannot believe you spent
a year with that guy.

21:57.684 --> 21:58.918
It was San Diego.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.687
Nothing matters
down there.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.356
Okay, then why
is he here now?

22:03.390 --> 22:06.025
Well, I was in the mood
for some serious bone action,

22:06.058 --> 22:07.026
so I texted.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.260
He was here in two hours.

22:08.294 --> 22:11.263
With his bone,
and those god-awful oils

22:11.297 --> 22:13.299
that smell like
rotting fruit.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.934
They're from Nepal.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.335
They open up
pleasure zones.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.471
No, they just smell
like hot garbage.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.207
Why do you think
I finished alone in the shower?

22:21.240 --> 22:23.209
Oh, Liz, wake up!
Come on!

22:23.242 --> 22:26.345
[Scoffs] I mean, everybody wants
some serious bone action.

22:26.379 --> 22:27.614
It's the human condition.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.616
Okay? But Bobby?

22:29.649 --> 22:32.084
I mean, come on!

22:32.118 --> 22:33.553
You can't be living
in the past.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.656
"Don't live in the past"?

22:36.689 --> 22:37.924
Says Sean Dudley?

22:37.957 --> 22:39.926
That's fantastic.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.594
Listen,
I hear your concerns.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.062
I can't stand Bobby,
either.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.564
[Groans]
But I told you,

22:44.597 --> 22:46.866
I'm going down the chute.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.368
Okay.
Okay. Okay, fine.

22:49.402 --> 22:51.538
But...

22:51.571 --> 22:53.372
Just hear me out,
alright?

22:53.406 --> 22:55.675
Something happened
to me today, Liz.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.610
Okay,
I was in this backyard.

22:57.644 --> 22:58.911
I was cleaning a pool

22:58.945 --> 23:00.179
like I've done
a million times before.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.815
But this time,
I got lost.

23:02.849 --> 23:06.385
It was the water and the sun
and the telephone lines.

23:06.419 --> 23:09.589
It was like every afternoon
I ever had,

23:09.622 --> 23:11.323
but all in one moment.

23:11.357 --> 23:14.226
And -- And -- And it was like
I-I touched this...

23:14.260 --> 23:17.864
[Sighs]
I touched this feeling --

23:17.897 --> 23:21.868
this feeling of
what it was like before,

23:21.901 --> 23:24.937
when it was just
you and me and Dad

23:24.971 --> 23:27.073
and we were all together.

23:28.941 --> 23:31.844
Now, I know that
you can't go back in time

23:31.878 --> 23:32.979
for real, okay?

23:33.012 --> 23:34.213
Although some alchemists

23:34.246 --> 23:36.449
think that, you know,
like...

23:36.483 --> 23:38.485
Okay, I'm sorry.

23:38.518 --> 23:41.688
That feeling

23:41.721 --> 23:43.422
of being together

23:43.456 --> 23:46.358
with the people
that you love --

23:46.392 --> 23:49.662
that's real.

23:49.696 --> 23:51.498
That's worth chasing.

23:54.901 --> 23:59.038
[Shakily]
So, what are you saying?

23:59.071 --> 24:02.074
If you're gonna
go down the chute,

24:02.108 --> 24:03.843
don't you at least
want to be

24:03.876 --> 24:05.211
with people
that you like?

24:05.244 --> 24:07.880
People that care
about you?

something else out.

-Hey!

24:57.296 --> 24:59.398
Could we have
a little friendly chat?

24:59.431 --> 25:00.600
About what?

25:00.633 --> 25:02.068
About, well...

25:02.101 --> 25:03.435
First of all,
we were wondering

25:03.469 --> 25:05.071
if you might have taken
some of Booie's equipment

25:05.104 --> 25:07.173
from his truck.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.107
Mm.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.242
Wouldn't do that
to Booie.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.178
It's probably
a street gang.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.479
Yep, probably
the, uh, Willow --

25:13.512 --> 25:15.748

Knife Boys.

They're a heavy crew.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.354
Mm.
They --
They stabbed my friend.

25:22.388 --> 25:25.224
But it's not just
the equipment.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.827
You've been poaching customers
from Booie.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.596
No. No.

25:29.629 --> 25:33.365
I have been offering my services
at a better price.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.602
No one can compete
with free.

25:35.635 --> 25:36.836
It's not fair.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.037
Do you understand

25:38.070 --> 25:40.139
how upsetting
this has been for Booie?

25:40.172 --> 25:42.074
I have never seen him
like this.

25:42.108 --> 25:46.045
Not since he got
kicked out of Mater Dei.

my business, okay?

26:24.250 --> 26:28.220

26:33.492 --> 26:35.427
We met in Vegas.

26:35.461 --> 26:37.997
I was there
with some buddies,

26:38.030 --> 26:40.900
and she was there
covering some big fight

26:40.933 --> 26:42.635
for her paper in Oregon.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.339
Saw her across the craps table,
so...

How romantic is that?

26:52.011 --> 26:53.245

she tells me
she's from Long Beach,

26:55.581 --> 26:59.251
hadn't been back
in a long time.

after that,

we are in bed.

27:06.458 --> 27:08.194
That's lovely.

27:09.561 --> 27:13.332
And then she tells me
she has this condition.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.769
And I don't believe
in fate.

27:16.803 --> 27:20.039

personal responsibility,

I-It just felt like
we had met for a reason.

to Long Beach with me.

I'm the man for you.

27:35.521 --> 27:41.093

to make you happy."

to the same matinee

28:25.404 --> 28:27.139
every weekend
at the Prince Charles,

28:27.173 --> 28:29.341
and she was always there.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.778

and started having coffee after,

28:31.811 --> 28:34.947

And eventually,

28:38.150 --> 28:40.519
we had a moment.

28:40.552 --> 28:44.223
And then her work
sent her away to Hong Kong.

just faded away.

the "real thing."

What's the "real thing"?

how you deal with her.

I was a cashier at Tesco's.

a thousand letters in my head

29:39.045 --> 29:41.047

to everybody,

to say.

29:45.451 --> 29:48.320
I'm really good
at leading a double life.

29:48.354 --> 29:49.755
It's a terrible talent.

Erg. Oh, my God.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.889
[Clears throat]

39:17.923 --> 39:21.092
Put it on this.

39:21.126 --> 39:24.029
And I'll take
our dad's watch, too.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.532
A trophy for your victory.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.634
[Giggles]

39:28.667 --> 39:29.801
Oh, Liz.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.971
Ooh! [Laughs]

39:35.206 --> 39:36.074
W-W-Wait.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.977
Well,
you need a trophy, too.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.046
What do you want?

39:41.079 --> 39:44.282
Man:
And even though it's windy,

39:44.315 --> 39:47.853
it's still a perfect day
to go to the beach.

39:47.886 --> 39:51.623
So, here we are at...

39:51.657 --> 39:53.291
Okay.

39:54.593 --> 39:58.063
I'm glad we got to write
another chapter in our story.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.331
I'm sorry
I have to go.

40:00.365 --> 40:03.068
Did you bring back
the parking pass?

40:03.101 --> 40:05.303
It was nice
meeting you guys.

40:05.336 --> 40:06.371
Wish we could hang more.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.640
But Karina needs me
back home.

40:08.674 --> 40:11.743
Que será,  brah.

Aloha, bitches!

40:23.455 --> 40:24.355
What did you say?

40:24.389 --> 40:27.459
What? Sorry,
it's just a saying.

40:27.493 --> 40:28.527
And I won't say it again.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.195
Yeah.
Ah.

40:30.228 --> 40:31.963
Man!

40:31.997 --> 40:34.032
It's even deader in here
than it was last night.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.735
Yeah. Saved the building,
but not the Lodge.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.269
Pyrrhic victory.

40:38.837 --> 40:41.006
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Blaise!

40:42.140 --> 40:44.510
I got my dad's watch back!

40:44.543 --> 40:45.644
Huh? Hey.

40:45.677 --> 40:48.346
Anything is possible.

40:48.379 --> 40:50.148
How?
Eh, you know.

40:50.181 --> 40:53.485
Bravery.
Facing death head-on.

40:53.519 --> 40:55.521
[Chuckles] My sister
got it back for me.

40:55.554 --> 40:56.722
Great.

Hey, oh, come on, man!
Stick around!

40:58.356 --> 41:00.091
I'm in the mood
to celebrate!
I got to get out of here.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.760
I've been cooped up
in the library.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.595
I need fresh air.
Ernie's here.

41:03.629 --> 41:04.830
Oh.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.464
He's been hitting it
pretty hard all night.

41:06.498 --> 41:09.067
Okay. Where is he?

41:10.802 --> 41:12.003
[Door opens]

41:12.037 --> 41:13.138
Dud: Ernie?

[Door closes]
Ernie.

Hey.

They took me
off the road.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.693
[Exhales deeply]

41:34.726 --> 41:36.662
I-I'm --

41:36.695 --> 41:40.566
I'm useless.

41:40.599 --> 41:42.333
I'm all done.

41:42.367 --> 41:44.402
No, no, no.

41:44.435 --> 41:45.871
No, it's not true.

41:45.904 --> 41:47.405
That's not true.

You're a king, Ernie.

Life is good.

41:59.150 --> 42:01.987

42:03.121 --> 42:05.691
The wrong turn.

42:05.724 --> 42:09.394
Every time.

My whole life.

42:18.336 --> 42:20.071
[Voice breaking]
We lost her.

42:22.841 --> 42:25.310
And then I ran.

42:30.148 --> 42:32.951
Are you talking
about Connie?

42:40.959 --> 42:43.228
Alright.

42:48.499 --> 42:49.968
You're wasted.

42:50.001 --> 42:51.569
Mm.

42:51.603 --> 42:53.739
And you're down.

42:53.772 --> 42:55.641
You're in a bad place.

42:55.674 --> 42:58.944
And I think that
the best thing for me to do

42:58.977 --> 43:01.012
is to get wasted.

43:01.046 --> 43:03.414
[Both laugh]

43:03.448 --> 43:05.016
So you're not alone
down there.

Well, do you have
a favorite song?

43:32.543 --> 43:34.112
Mm-hmm.

43:34.145 --> 43:36.882
Love's old sweet song.

43:36.915 --> 43:39.350
[Laughs]

43:39.384 --> 43:42.654
That is
the one and only track.

43:42.688 --> 43:44.790
You'll know it someday.

43:44.823 --> 43:46.992
It's everything at once.

Tick-tock, tick-tock.

I can smell her perfume
in the corridors.

She was there
when I got back.

43:59.337 --> 44:01.940
Waiting at the station.

Oh, my head was gone.

Her head was gone, too.

I saw the bridge
and the stars.

I saw
what was underneath.

And save the kingdom.

So, Thermosaurus.

you'll never learn  *
