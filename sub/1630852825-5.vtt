WEBVTT

00:54.846 --> 00:56.890
805 spilled coffee all over the carpet.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.767
What are they going to do?

00:58.850 --> 01:01.394
Replace the whole carpet. $9,000.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.855
For a rug? Damn.

01:05.982 --> 01:08.693
Take the tags off
before you send it to dry cleaning.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.653
Why is she cleaning a brand-new Prada?

01:18.703 --> 01:21.790
Want to see what 15K
of cock cakes look like?

01:21.873 --> 01:23.875
Freakin' 1105 is turning 50.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.719
This is for employees only.

01:36.387 --> 01:40.308
-Hi, Charlie, Gaby. Y'all good?
-Hi, Neff. All good. Crazy night.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.727
Hmm. I can send up breakfast. The usual?

01:42.811 --> 01:44.771
That'd be great. Thank you.

01:47.023 --> 01:50.819
-They're not supposed to be in here.
-That's Charlie and Gaby Rosen.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.821
As in Aby Rosen.

01:52.904 --> 01:56.074
When your dad owns the hotel,
you can go wherever you want.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.142
She stayed here
for like three, four months, I guess.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.435
Why so long?

02:24.519 --> 02:25.812
What did she want?

02:25.895 --> 02:28.106
She didn't want anything. It's a hotel.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.819
-Lunch break ended ten minutes ago.
-I'm still eating.

02:32.902 --> 02:36.614
Union rules say you can't talk to me
while I'm eating my lunch.

02:36.698 --> 02:40.118
I'm on break.
When I'm off break you'll know.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.038
-I can go if you need to--
-Mmm-mmm.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.039
I got time.

02:45.915 --> 02:46.749
Go ahead.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.168
Go.

02:50.003 --> 02:54.048
Did she tell you anything about her past?
Parents? Her friends in Europe?

02:55.216 --> 02:57.844
You said you wanted
to talk about Anna at the hotel.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.554
Those were the parameters.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.639
You're very loyal to her.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.184
I'm ride or die.
Just the kind of person I am.

03:08.897 --> 03:09.898
How's she doing?

03:12.525 --> 03:13.693
Have you been to see her?

03:14.277 --> 03:16.321
Prison's a little… The hours I work

03:17.030 --> 03:20.074
make it pretty hard to get there
during visiting hours.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.367
It's far.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.077
She's okay?

03:23.703 --> 03:28.541
She's okay.
I mean, it's prison, but considering.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.376
I worry about her, you know.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.879
You care about her.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.548
You and Anna are really good friends.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.635
It wasn't a friendship thing at first.

03:44.974 --> 03:48.311
In the beginning,
I needed money to finance my film

03:48.394 --> 03:52.607
and Anna…
Anna liked to make it rain.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.778
People, we're almost
at full occupancy.

03:56.861 --> 03:59.197
I'm gonna need everyone
to be on their game today.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.448
Engineering, how are we?

04:00.531 --> 04:01.699
Cardio machines are fixed.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.202
Waiting on the steam room,
but we'll be done by 5:00.

04:04.285 --> 04:07.163
Before noon. Concierge team,
what do we have for our VIPs?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.999
-I'm on it. I've got--
-I'm on it.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.378
Tour of the Rauschenberg exhibition
at the MoMA booked for the LeClercs.

04:13.461 --> 04:15.713
Sunset helicopter ride
for the newlyweds on ten.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.007
I got Bergdorf's to open
after hours for Ms. Leong.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.509
Ms. Leong is my VIP.

04:19.592 --> 04:22.428
-Yet she came to me.
-We're looking into it.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.848
If the readers are giving you trouble,
don't upset the guests.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.268
Write down card numbers
and run charges later.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.477
Keep the guests happy.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.898
Remember, every detail matters.
Okay. Let's get out there.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.571
-Neff. She's new and she's learning.
-Hmm.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.700
She's leaving money on the table
'cause she's scared of the guests.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.703
I'm not about to step over cash
while she learns to hustle.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.122
Girl. You're working me.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.999
-Go.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.460
You have to change the TV in my room.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.796
I need a bigger screen.
I've gotta watch my dailies.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.423
I'll speak with the management.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.300
What's your name again?

05:00.383 --> 05:02.385
Is it Nell?

05:02.468 --> 05:05.555
I don't know. You look so familiar.
Do I know you from somewhere?

05:05.638 --> 05:07.307
Neff. We were at film school together.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.809
Oh. Right.

05:09.934 --> 05:13.980
Uh, well, you're doing your thing.
Cool. Good luck.

05:53.936 --> 05:54.854
Name?

05:54.937 --> 05:57.482
Delvey. Anna. Some kind of accent.
Tipping Benjies.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.400
Welcome to 12 George, Ms. Delvey.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.777
Thank you.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.240
Thank you.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.002
Money just walked through the door.

06:44.445 --> 06:45.822
-Hey, Fatima.
-Viv.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.126
Morning.

07:06.426 --> 07:11.180
What is up with everyone today?
Did I miss breaking news?

07:13.599 --> 07:14.600
Hello?

07:16.352 --> 07:17.395
What?

07:17.478 --> 07:20.440
<i>America Investigated</i> released their promo
of next week's show.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.444
Say more words.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.905
So, you know,
with the <i>Rolling Stone</i> UVA rape story,

07:27.989 --> 07:31.701
the Brian Williams thing,
that Clinton Foundation story,

07:31.784 --> 07:36.289
really it's a… well, a different way
of looking at the whole idea of fake news,

07:36.372 --> 07:40.084
media ethics,
failure in journalistic integrity…

07:40.168 --> 07:45.506
And really, it's, uh, you know,
it's a whole… But I think maybe…

07:45.590 --> 07:46.716
Lou!

07:47.800 --> 07:53.389
The kid from your story, Donovan Lamb,
he's gonna be on the show.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.224
What?

07:55.308 --> 07:57.810
Donovan Lamb gave an interview about you.

07:57.894 --> 08:02.523
<i>America Investigated</i> is doing
a show about bad journalism,

08:02.607 --> 08:05.735
and one of the subjects is you.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.238
Vivian.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.660
-I'm fine.
-Hey, it's okay.

08:14.744 --> 08:15.578
I'm fine.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.246
I, um…

08:17.830 --> 08:20.541
I am fine.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.460
Want to see the promo? Get it over with?

08:22.543 --> 08:23.794
No. I don't want to see it.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.882
-Vivian.
-I need coffee. Anyone want coffee?

09:12.677 --> 09:13.511
Hi.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.472
I know I scheduled the media room,

09:17.640 --> 09:21.519
but I really have
only just a few questions today.

09:21.602 --> 09:22.478
Magazines?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.525
Shit. I don't have the magazines.

09:27.608 --> 09:31.070
-What do you mean you don't have them?
-I forgot to get them.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.031
-You forgot?
-I forgot.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.783
I'll… Next time.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.827
I ask you for one little thing.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.621
I'm doing you a favor,
giving you an exclusive interview.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.332
-The least you could do--
-I forgot. It happens. Okay?

09:45.668 --> 09:46.502
Okay.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.005
Okay.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.972
-What is wrong with you?
-Nothing's wrong with me.

09:58.055 --> 10:01.434
-Something's wrong with you.
-Nothing is wrong with me.

10:01.517 --> 10:02.685
I'm fine.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.312
Then why are you being so spacey?

10:04.395 --> 10:06.188
Look. I'm pregnant. I'm tired.

10:06.272 --> 10:10.693
I meant to go by the newsstand
and get <i>Forbes</i> and <i>Fortune</i>

10:10.776 --> 10:13.446
and the whole list,
but I forgot and I'm sorry.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.616
So… can we work?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.287
I've been going over receipts
and I need you to explain.

10:21.370 --> 10:24.540
You left Billy's place
and moved into the 12 George

10:25.333 --> 10:28.836
and it seems like you just stayed.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.215
Like, longer than anywhere before.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.258
So why?

10:35.217 --> 10:36.302
You're mad at me.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.514
I'm not mad at you.
Not everything's about you, Anna.

10:40.598 --> 10:44.060
So someone hurt
your sweet, little baby feelings? Huh?

10:44.644 --> 10:45.478
Anna.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.521
No. Your feelings are hurt. Why?

10:48.814 --> 10:51.942
You deposited 200K from CNB,

10:52.026 --> 10:54.695
right before moving into the 12 George,
so you had the money.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.448
But you'd never
stayed anywhere that long before.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.785
-What about the 12 George was different?
-Is it work?

11:00.868 --> 11:03.079
Are you doing a bad job?
Are you getting fired?

11:03.162 --> 11:03.996
No.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.832
Anna, 12 George?

11:06.916 --> 11:08.250
Is it your husband?

11:08.334 --> 11:11.253
Did he say anything
about how fat your face is getting?

11:11.337 --> 11:14.882
No, he didn't.
And my face isn't getting fat.

11:14.965 --> 11:15.925
No, it is.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.762
You're pregnant, so that will happen.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.306
You get fat. Your face will get fat.

11:22.390 --> 11:26.227
It will get huge and ugly,
and then baby comes.

11:26.852 --> 11:30.231
It happens to everyone.
I told you, you're not special.

11:33.109 --> 11:39.657
Why did you stay so long at the hotel?

11:41.909 --> 11:45.746
Vivian, I'm in prison all day,
all the time,

11:45.830 --> 11:48.874
and these women,
they're interesting on their own,

11:48.958 --> 11:51.252
but all the talk
is mostly how to kill your husband

11:51.335 --> 11:54.296
and how easy it is to do identity theft.

11:54.922 --> 11:58.384
Don't be selfish. Entertain me.

11:58.467 --> 12:01.679
Who's hurting
your little baby feelings, and why?

12:07.101 --> 12:07.935
Guard!

12:13.691 --> 12:17.153
Nightmare. We've already
had to change her room twice.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.280
She's driving the staff crazy
asking for shit.

12:19.363 --> 12:22.199
More towels, more pillows.
Better light, too much light.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.952
She wants a special kind of tea.
What the fuck?

12:26.954 --> 12:30.291
The chick tips hundreds,
but still, she's a pain in my ass.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.585
-That Anna Delvey?
-That's the one.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.378
She's always needing something.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.298
Like what?

12:38.966 --> 12:40.634
She's a VVIP.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.012
She's got to have a great table.
This is the best.

12:43.095 --> 12:47.975
You know we save this table
for the CEO of Goldman on Thursdays.

12:48.058 --> 12:51.020
It's Thursday. No, absolutely not.

12:53.355 --> 12:57.818
Tickets. Broadway. Orchestra.
Anytime you want. Any show.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.363
For the rest of the year.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.789
Delvey, 7:00 p.m.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.878
What is taking so long?

13:15.961 --> 13:19.632
What can I do to expedite the approvals?
I can't lose my building.

13:19.715 --> 13:23.302
Everything's in progress,
due diligence, prelim paperwork.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.221
You've done everything you can do.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.432
Now you're in a holding pattern.
That's how it works. You wait.

13:30.726 --> 13:34.104
Du Bellay 2005.
Compliments of your concierge, Neff.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.565
Thank you.

14:01.841 --> 14:02.675
Damn.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.179
You comped a $400 bottle of wine.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.682
I can't justify that.
It's coming out of your paycheck.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.809
Don't worry.
It's going to pay off. You'll see.

14:12.726 --> 14:13.769
Pray it does.

14:24.446 --> 14:27.950
Just focus on securing the lease.
I know you'll pay the retainer.

14:28.033 --> 14:28.868
Hmm.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.497
Ms. Delvey, I have the documents
you requested we print for you.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.291
Thanks.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.378
You like the wine?

14:41.255 --> 14:42.089
Mmm-hmm.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.760
So we need to go over
some of the lease deal points,

14:46.844 --> 14:49.179
-especially the liability clauses.
-Hmm.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.441
I said we'd like to make a reservation
to go and see the High Line.

15:00.524 --> 15:05.029
Ma'am, you don't need reservations
for the High Line. It's a public park.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.238
We don't want to wait.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.533
I'd like you to call someone
and make sure that we're on the list.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.619
Ma'am, there's no one to call.
It's a park.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.954
You show up, you walk.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.332
I demand a reservation.

15:16.415 --> 15:20.169
Absolutely, yes,
I will call Park Services myself.

15:23.505 --> 15:24.548
Neff, right?

15:24.632 --> 15:26.383
Le Coucou was great.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.093
See you around.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.181
How can I help you today?

15:42.524 --> 15:43.359
Hey.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.907
So <i>America Investigated</i> reached out.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.243
-They wanted a comment from you.
-Paul.

15:53.327 --> 15:57.373
But I convinced them
to sit down with you for a full interview.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.211
-What?
-Think about it.

16:03.170 --> 16:06.215
It's a chance for you
to clarify what really happened.

16:06.924 --> 16:10.302
Well, go on the record with them,
clear up any confusion.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.974
<i>AI's</i> got a good rep.
They'll give you a fair shake.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.267
A fair shake.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.645
Vivian, I…

16:21.939 --> 16:25.609
pulled every string I had
to get this for you.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.237
It's the perfect opportunity.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.156
I have to work.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.827
Look, we have a few days.
Give it some thought, okay, Viv…

16:38.580 --> 16:40.332
I will have that all arranged.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.168
Tickets will be waiting for you.
You have a nice day.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.215
We want to go to Governors Island.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.383
I got you.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.636
-I need you.
-Hey. Wait your turn.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.554
Neff.

16:54.471 --> 16:58.058
I'm sorry, Ms. Delvey,
I have to deal with the waiting guests.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.685
If you could join the line.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.896
You need to take the ferry from here
in order to get to Governors Island,

17:02.980 --> 17:04.815
but you'll have to take a taxi or an Uber

17:04.898 --> 17:08.485
up to the Battery Maritime Building
to catch the ferry.

17:08.569 --> 17:12.322
Before the ferry, we want to grab lunch
and take a picnic with us.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.410
I can call Dean & DeLuca…

17:23.375 --> 17:25.753
Jeannot, I need another concierge
up here right away.

17:26.670 --> 17:31.300
Someone is coming to help you.
How can I help you, Ms. Delvey?

17:34.094 --> 17:36.096
Now, gentlemen, let's get to business.

17:36.180 --> 17:39.224
We're here to change the face
of the New York social club.

17:43.312 --> 17:46.065
Hi, I'm calling on behalf of Ms. Delvey.

17:46.148 --> 17:49.234
She'll be available to meet you
at Ellis Reed at 11:00 a.m.

17:49.902 --> 17:50.736
Thank you.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.124
Your car is waiting.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.460
I've called ahead.
They'll have your Lady Grey tea.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.213
The driver will wait,
take you to your lunch with Mr. Lavin,

18:09.296 --> 18:11.006
then your afternoon meeting with Citibank.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.674
You're amazing.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.262
-Let me get that bag, Ms. Delvey.
-Thank you.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.518
Oh, Neff, I'll need to have
some other things scheduled.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.561
I'll take care of it all. No problem.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.779
So you were setting up meetings.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.906
I was setting up Anna.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.867
And if I do say so myself, I killed it.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.452
My database game was on point.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.287
Wait, what databases?

18:42.955 --> 18:47.209
Every restaurant, club, salon,
even the PR agencies,

18:47.292 --> 18:50.087
they all have these lists of who's hot,

18:50.170 --> 18:52.631
who's a name,
who's worth knowing. A database.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.509
At 12 George, if you're a guest
and we want to keep you happy,

18:55.592 --> 18:57.594
it's my job
to get you on the right database.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.806
If you're on the right database,
you'll receive every invite,

19:00.889 --> 19:03.308
you'll enter every VIP entrance,

19:03.392 --> 19:06.186
you'll always get a ticket,
always get a table.

19:07.146 --> 19:11.233
I got Anna's name on some of
the most exclusive databases.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.902
So you're like
the power behind the throne?

19:14.486 --> 19:15.487
You could say that.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.241
Actually, yeah, let's say that.
Put that in the article.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.715
Delvey, yes.
She's one of our most important guests.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.466
Thank you for making the exception.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.759
She'll be well looked after.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.763
<i>This is one of our special guests.</i>

19:41.847 --> 19:45.475
<i>She's not standing in line on the street</i>
<i>with everybody else on release day.</i>

19:45.559 --> 19:49.813
<i>Look, Toni, between you and me,</i>
<i>the chick is a German heiress.</i>

19:51.273 --> 19:52.858
I want you to pull out all the stops.

19:52.941 --> 19:56.445
Between you and me, my guest
just bought up two blocks of Park Avenue.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.407
I'm telling you.
You want her on your event list.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.618
She's opening a club
in one of Aby Rosen's buildings.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.619
She's a major player.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.123
Delvey.

20:23.764 --> 20:24.640
Delvey.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.152
D-E-L

20:38.820 --> 20:40.489
V-E-Y.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.624
-You're in.
-Thanks, Neff.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.638
Anna is my age
and she is running her world.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.182
She's a CEO. It's inspiring.

21:09.726 --> 21:11.061
Ow!

21:11.144 --> 21:13.397
-Babe, you've got to see this.
-I was talking.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.899
All these fools
paid thousands and thousands of dollars,

21:15.983 --> 21:18.527
rushed to the Bahamas
because some guy on the Internet said

21:18.610 --> 21:20.988
he was throwing
some luxury party on a private island.

21:21.071 --> 21:24.491
When they got there, dude got them
sleeping in disaster relief tents

21:24.574 --> 21:26.743
and eating Velveeta cheese!

21:28.704 --> 21:31.498
Oh, man, these Fyre Festival tweets
are everything.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.668
-Look, read it.
-No, I'm too busy counting my money.

21:34.751 --> 21:38.046
Look at this, these are
my Anna tips from just this week.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.131
Why?

21:39.214 --> 21:42.384
What do you mean why?
Who cares? She's tipping hundreds.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.219
Mmm-mmm. People only flash money like that

21:44.303 --> 21:46.388
when they're trying
to distract you from something.

21:46.471 --> 21:47.931
Don't trust that chick.

21:48.015 --> 21:51.143
That chick's tips
are going to pay for my first film.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.771
I am working it.
Go back to your tire festival.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.897
Fyre Festival.

21:57.524 --> 22:00.694
Yo, all these rich folk
got no place to poop.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.196
These dudes are going to jail!

22:12.164 --> 22:13.248
Vivian, can we talk?

22:24.134 --> 22:25.969
Sure you don't want to sit? Please, sit.

22:45.697 --> 22:46.531
Paul--

22:46.615 --> 22:48.909
I wanted to check in with you.
Make sure you're okay.

22:49.534 --> 22:50.786
Is that it?

22:50.869 --> 22:52.662
And I wanted to know

22:52.746 --> 22:55.749
if you had any thoughts
about going on <i>AI,</i> doing the interview.

22:56.666 --> 22:57.667
I have no thoughts.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.378
Is that it?

22:59.461 --> 23:01.004
You're not gonna give me an inch.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.716
-Are we done?
-No.

23:04.800 --> 23:07.219
I, um… Can I…

23:07.844 --> 23:10.097
Uh, just… Okay, listen.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.014
Uh…

23:12.724 --> 23:15.477
When we were a team, we were killer.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.313
And I think about that a lot.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.566
About how much fun we used to have.

23:21.650 --> 23:25.320
I mean, this place used to be…
I used to love coming to work.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.031
The four of us
used to go on vacation together.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.616
You're having a kid, for fuck's sake.

23:29.699 --> 23:32.911
Marilyn should be the one
throwing you a baby shower.

23:32.994 --> 23:33.995
I mean, I never…

23:36.206 --> 23:37.707
meant for any of this to end…

23:43.088 --> 23:44.589
You never got your say.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.342
I know.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.889
If you do the interview,
you answer their questions,

23:52.973 --> 23:54.599
this will all be over.

23:54.683 --> 23:57.310
You can be heard in your own words.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.020
Explain what really happened.

23:59.771 --> 24:00.856
Paul--

24:00.939 --> 24:03.525
Just think about doing the interview.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.360
Please.

24:07.070 --> 24:07.904
Okay.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.830
-Lewis, give the lady some room.

24:16.913 --> 24:19.124
She's coming to Fortress,
you won't change her mind.

24:19.207 --> 24:21.209
-A guy can try, right?
-Yeah.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.254
Excuse me. Don't sign anything.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.094
Morrison is an amateur.

24:31.178 --> 24:34.681
-Fuck Fortress. You need to come to me.

24:34.764 --> 24:36.266
You know what I can do for you?

24:36.892 --> 24:40.479
Look, if you transfer your trust fund
to Jupiter Group,

24:40.562 --> 24:44.524
we can do big things.
Major league things, you know.

24:45.108 --> 24:47.235
Uh, Conrad, one thing at a time.

24:47.319 --> 24:52.157
I'm waiting on my approvals for ADF.
I have to get that settled.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.408
That'll happen.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.495
Look, I'm focused
on the bigger picture, okay?

24:56.578 --> 24:58.455
Your future is not in Germany.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.207
We could be a great team.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.542
You know that, right?

25:02.626 --> 25:06.630
And not just Jupiter Group.
Me. Personally.

25:08.256 --> 25:09.257
I'm here for you.

25:17.474 --> 25:20.477
This was honestly so refreshing.
Thank you for meeting up with me.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.811
-Of course.
-My pleasure.

25:23.271 --> 25:24.564
And that's my car.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.734
-Anna, let's talk in the morning? Great.
-Yes.

25:27.817 --> 25:29.319
Lewis. You need a ride?

25:29.402 --> 25:31.238
No, I'm good. My car's two minutes away.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.572
-All right.
-See you.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.615
-See you guys.
-Bye.

25:34.449 --> 25:37.827
That's…
It was great meeting you too. Bye.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.210
Your car.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.461
I cancelled it.

25:47.420 --> 25:48.755
Let me come up.

25:48.838 --> 25:50.715
Um, I really need some sleep.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.676
I can help with that.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.764
Ms. Delvey, you have an urgent call.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.684
They insisted on holding for you.
I think it's your mother.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.185
Oh! Uh…

26:02.269 --> 26:06.439
My mother. It could be serious, Conrad.
I'm so sorry. I have to take this.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.566
I can wait.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.986
No. It's my mother.
This will take a while. Neff?

26:11.069 --> 26:14.531
Sir, out front. Nico will be happy
to assist you with a car, a taxi,

26:14.614 --> 26:16.533
whatever kind of transportation you need.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.827
Good night, Conrad. Let's talk next week.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.507
Sit down. Now we can talk.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.342
-Okay.

26:35.510 --> 26:38.847
He actually thought he was getting some.

26:38.930 --> 26:43.101
Why? You've given him no flirt.
No bounce. No hope. And yet…

26:43.184 --> 26:44.603
It was a business dinner.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.480
He wouldn't have his hand on my ass
if I were a man,

26:47.564 --> 26:49.274
-but because I'm a woman…

26:49.357 --> 26:52.611
They think they can give a crappy deal
and get a blow job on the side.

26:52.694 --> 26:55.989
-That is entitlement.
-Yeah, it's a fucking boys' playground.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.574
The movie industry's the same way.

26:57.657 --> 26:59.367
I went to film school, directed shorts.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.454
I'm good, but nobody gives a fuck
about female directors

27:02.537 --> 27:03.747
unless it's a tampon ad.

27:05.665 --> 27:10.170
You know, I knew you were a creative.
You have a vibe.

27:10.253 --> 27:12.339
You're not like
the rest of the basic bitches here.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.090
All living to work.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.509
Yes, this is definitely not my dream job.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.637
I'm getting the money together
for a feature.

27:19.554 --> 27:20.513
You'll do it.

27:21.431 --> 27:22.515
I can tell.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.490
You want to come to a party?

27:39.449 --> 27:40.408
<i>Did you go?</i>

27:40.492 --> 27:44.496
Mmm. Fraternizing is a big no-no
at the hotel. You get fired for it.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.081
But did you go?

27:47.332 --> 27:48.875
Hell yeah, I went.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.003
Pow!

27:52.671 --> 27:57.717
<i>It was magical.</i>
<i>That party was next-level balling.</i>

27:57.801 --> 28:00.095
Has everyone met my friend Neff?
She's a filmmaker.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.012
Hey, Neff.

28:01.096 --> 28:06.434
<i>All of these rich suits,</i>
<i>models, some famous singer.</i>

28:06.518 --> 28:08.561
<i>Oh, and Martin Shkreli, that pharma bro</i>

28:08.645 --> 28:10.605
<i>who raised all the prices</i>
<i>of those AIDS drugs</i>

28:10.689 --> 28:12.357
<i>and ended up in prison? He was there.</i>

28:12.440 --> 28:16.027
I told them to chill.
Guys like me don't do time.

28:18.988 --> 28:19.989
Another bottle.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.450
Uh, the 1975 Dom.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.119
<i>There was one of the Culkins.</i>

28:24.202 --> 28:27.038
<i>Maybe the one from</i> Home Alone,
<i>maybe the other one.</i>

28:27.122 --> 28:28.039
I drank a lot.

28:28.123 --> 28:31.209
Okay, so tell the truth.
Who was planning to hit Fyre Festival?

28:31.292 --> 28:33.169
What a shit show.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.338
I heard it made Burning Man
look like luxury.

28:35.422 --> 28:38.174
-I haven't gotten my refund.
-They slept in FEMA tents.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.092
Really?

28:39.634 --> 28:42.262
Uh, yeah,
I was talking to someone who knows.

28:42.345 --> 28:47.142
Ugh, poor Billy. He tries so hard,
but he doesn't have what it takes.

28:48.435 --> 28:51.396
I'm sorry, that was so mean of me.
That was mean. That was--

28:51.479 --> 28:53.356
Okay, hey. Check this out, ready?

28:57.527 --> 28:58.611
<i>You don't even know…</i>

29:00.113 --> 29:02.699
<i>It was</i> The Carter V <i>album.</i>

29:02.782 --> 29:06.244
<i>Shkreli had bought</i>
<i>Lil Wayne's</i> The Carter V <i>album,</i>

29:06.327 --> 29:08.997
<i>just bought the masters,</i>
<i>because he wanted to hear it.</i>

29:09.080 --> 29:11.416
<i>That album was on lockdown</i>
<i>and he just bought it.</i>

29:11.499 --> 29:14.502
<i>That's when I realized</i>
<i>he was Martin Shkreli, the pharma bro.</i>

29:14.586 --> 29:17.172
The dude who disrespected
the Wu Tang Clan.

29:18.047 --> 29:20.049
<i>Right there, at my table.</i>

29:20.133 --> 29:24.846
<i>The evening was sick.</i>
<i>Next-level sick. And I was there.</i>

29:25.513 --> 29:26.347
<i>Wow.</i>

29:29.142 --> 29:31.352
<i>And you know what they did</i>
<i>with the bill when it came?</i>

29:34.939 --> 29:38.234
<i>They called it credit card roulette.</i>

29:38.318 --> 29:39.402
The winner is Martin.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.112
-Oh.
-Yeah.

29:47.952 --> 29:50.371
It was crazy.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.916
This guy just bought Lil Wayne's album.

29:52.999 --> 29:53.833
I don't believe it.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.794
I heard it! With my own ears.

29:55.877 --> 29:59.005
Who does that? Literally appropriating
a Black artist's work?

29:59.088 --> 30:00.840
Babe, that's… No.

30:00.924 --> 30:03.092
These people are so fucking cool and rich.

30:03.176 --> 30:07.847
This is like one of the top ten
best nights of my life.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.641
You are so missing the point.

30:09.724 --> 30:12.352
No, you are missing the point.

30:12.435 --> 30:19.317
And you know I've been saving all my tips.
I almost have the budget for my film.

30:19.400 --> 30:20.527
Mmm.

30:21.319 --> 30:22.946
I'm going to get it done this time.

30:23.029 --> 30:24.113
Okay.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.199
Hey, you don't know Anna.

30:26.866 --> 30:27.742
Not like I do.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.036
Okay.

30:30.119 --> 30:31.579
She talks to me.

30:32.288 --> 30:35.333
Nobody ever talks to me.
I just make their reservations.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.919
I'm not some fucking chair. I'm a star.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.839
-Hmm.
-I'm huge. I glow.

30:43.591 --> 30:44.592
Come here.

30:54.352 --> 30:55.687
I glow.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.240
Todd.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.534
What's going on with you and Anna?

31:09.617 --> 31:10.827
Nothing's going on.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.079
Yeah, but did you
go to Rikers the other day,

31:13.162 --> 31:15.081
hurt Anna's feelings and then leave?

31:15.164 --> 31:18.126
Hurt Anna… Hurt Anna's feelings?

31:18.209 --> 31:20.420
<i>She said I hurt her feelings?</i>

31:20.503 --> 31:22.171
That's not the words that she used,

31:22.255 --> 31:25.383
but that is what I have gleaned
from the 16 phone calls

31:25.466 --> 31:28.136
<i>I have accepted from Rikers</i>
<i>in the past 24 hours.</i>

31:28.219 --> 31:29.387
You hurt her feelings.

31:31.514 --> 31:32.515
Come on, Viv.

31:32.599 --> 31:34.976
You cannot possibly believe
that I hurt her feelings.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.312
All I know is that she's upset.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.105
And when she's upset, my phone rings.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.899
<i>And I want to know what happened,</i>

31:40.982 --> 31:43.526
so maybe I could stop
the phone assault I'm living under.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.652
Please help me.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.654
She just wants something she can't have.

31:46.738 --> 31:47.989
Okay, what does she want?

31:48.072 --> 31:49.240
<i>Not the point.</i>

31:49.324 --> 31:51.951
The point is
that her feelings are not hurt.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.620
<i>I did not hurt her feelings.</i>

31:53.703 --> 31:55.997
The point is
that she is a manipulative narcissist

31:56.080 --> 31:58.541
who can't imagine
that anyone else has feelings or needs.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.336
-So she hurt your feelings?
-<i>Goodbye, Todd.</i>

32:08.426 --> 32:09.260
Ready?

32:14.432 --> 32:16.059
Neff!

32:16.142 --> 32:16.976
Neff!

32:19.354 --> 32:20.730
-Neff!

32:20.813 --> 32:23.399
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

32:23.483 --> 32:25.026
Look! Do you like it?

32:25.902 --> 32:29.113
Yeah, no, that's cool. That's my color.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.740
-What?
-That's my color!

32:30.823 --> 32:33.409
I know! That's what I said.
It's a Neff color.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.411
I'm buying it for you.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.040
Anna, you don't need to buy me anything.

32:39.123 --> 32:42.752
No, I already bought it.
Wait, come inside. Hold on.

32:44.879 --> 32:47.674
There's all this great stuff to try on.
Are you coming?

32:58.559 --> 33:00.687
-Hi. Hi.
-Hi.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.273
-You made it.
-Only just.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.401
My boss was such a bitch today.

33:06.484 --> 33:09.070
I had to walk eight blocks in heels.
Can you even…

33:09.654 --> 33:12.782
-Oh. Rachel, you know my friend Neff.

33:12.865 --> 33:15.243
Neff, Rachel works at <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

33:15.326 --> 33:19.080
Her boss is a monster.
Some bitter 46-year-old.

33:19.163 --> 33:19.998
So bitter.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.874
Horrible bosses are the worst.

33:21.958 --> 33:25.003
She's jealous. She knows
I'll be her boss one day soon.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.337
-Yes!

33:29.215 --> 33:30.591
This heat is intense.

33:30.675 --> 33:31.509
Mmm.

33:32.051 --> 33:33.469
No, it's so good for you.

33:33.553 --> 33:35.513
You should
put a few of these at the hotel.

33:35.596 --> 33:36.681
You'd make a fortune.

33:36.764 --> 33:38.099
You work at the hotel?

33:38.182 --> 33:40.393
While I raise money for my film.

33:40.977 --> 33:41.853
Sure.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.982
-How did Rachel know Anna?
-I don't know.

33:46.983 --> 33:49.861
She was already around
by the time Anna moved into the hotel.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.947
They weren't like old friends
or anything, but…

33:55.116 --> 33:57.660
Rachel was always there
when stuff was fun. Kind of like…

33:58.536 --> 34:01.706
She was there for the Instagram moments.
As long as there was a good time.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.042
So you don't think
it was a real friendship?

34:04.792 --> 34:06.586
Not like me and Anna. Rachel…

34:07.754 --> 34:10.298
took and took and took.
Never paid Anna back.

34:10.798 --> 34:14.635
Everything she wore was Anna's.
I think she was trying to be Anna.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.472
-Anna put up with that?
-I don't even know that she noticed.

34:17.555 --> 34:18.848
Or she liked it. I mean…

34:19.682 --> 34:21.893
Rachel looked up to her.
That must have felt good.

34:22.477 --> 34:26.355
If you're a person who likes Rachel,
I guess that feels like a compliment.

34:29.400 --> 34:33.529
I could, uh, get you an appointment
at Anna's hair salon, if you want.

34:33.613 --> 34:36.449
I mean, Sergio does not take new clients,
but he would for me.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.367
-What's wrong with my hair?
-Nothing.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.335
Ta-da!

34:47.418 --> 34:48.836
-Oh, my God.
-Damn.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.547
I could never get my hair
to look that good.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.884
Do hers too. Put it on my bill.

34:54.967 --> 34:56.511
-Oh, my God, really?
-Mmm-hmm.

35:04.268 --> 35:09.398
Now Kacy got some voodoo magic,
spiritual shit going on.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.275
And those workouts…

35:12.360 --> 35:13.903
Huh! Killer.

35:13.986 --> 35:16.322
Thirty seconds to go.
Grind it out. Keep moving.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.449
Kacy, I have asthma.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.868
Come on, Neff. You can do this.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.537
Pain is weakness leaving the body.

35:23.121 --> 35:26.290
Anna, off your phone.
Experience the beauty of this moment.

35:26.374 --> 35:27.375
When is it over?

35:27.458 --> 35:31.879
Fifteen seconds. Keep going.
Every rep counts. Every rep.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.006
Thank your legs for holding you up.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.466
I can't hear you.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.884
Thank you, legs!

35:36.968 --> 35:39.554
How you do this is how you do everything.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.473
Full-ass it or half-ass it. Your choice.

35:43.182 --> 35:45.309
-And done!

35:45.852 --> 35:46.727
Beautiful.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.646
I'm dying. I'm literally dying.

35:48.729 --> 35:50.523
I thought that was a pretty easy workout.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.400
If your body's in shape.

35:53.484 --> 35:57.280
Rachel, you are a beautiful, strong soul.

35:58.364 --> 36:01.159
In a world where you can be anything,
be kind.

36:06.038 --> 36:07.957
That was shitty. I'm sorry.

36:09.834 --> 36:10.960
It's okay. We're cool.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.423
Kacy's where she's at for a reason.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.925
I don't know that Anna cared much
about being in shape.

36:18.009 --> 36:21.137
It's just that Kacy trains
all these famous people from movies,

36:21.220 --> 36:25.725
and Anna wanted the best.
She paid Kacy $4,000 a month.

36:25.808 --> 36:27.727
You never questioned
where the money was from?

36:28.644 --> 36:30.062
Anna had a whole building.

36:33.566 --> 36:34.609
Here it is.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.694
-This is your building?
-Holy shit.

36:36.777 --> 36:38.696
-Brava, Anna.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.951
You are the real fucking deal.

36:48.497 --> 36:49.707
Real fucking deal.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.005
Wait until you see
what I'm going to do with it.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.883
-Want to go inside?
-Yes!

36:58.966 --> 37:00.092
-Come on.

37:05.097 --> 37:07.558
Maybe this sounds crazy or whatever,

37:08.851 --> 37:10.228
but Anna is a visionary.

37:11.938 --> 37:12.813
A genius.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.900
You thought she could make ADF a reality?

37:15.983 --> 37:18.319
It was a reality. She was doing it.

37:18.402 --> 37:21.530
I saw it with my own eyes.
I walked through it.

37:24.533 --> 37:28.079
12 George has infrared saunas now.
On every floor.

37:28.162 --> 37:29.497
Whose idea was that? Anna.

37:30.122 --> 37:31.749
Hotel's making a fortune.

37:31.832 --> 37:34.126
She had a good business head,
that's for sure.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.711
She worked hard.

37:36.462 --> 37:40.174
She was waiting for the final approvals
to coming through on the financing.

37:40.258 --> 37:43.344
Talking to bankers, meeting with lawyers.
ADF, this close.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.223
Yeah, she, uh…

37:48.724 --> 37:50.142
She really convinced people.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.145
I don't care what people are saying.
Anna is rich.

37:53.229 --> 37:55.648
Maybe her dad cut her off,
but I booked the meetings.

37:55.731 --> 37:56.649
I saw the paperwork.

37:56.732 --> 37:59.527
How could she know all that stuff
if she ain't come from money?

38:01.696 --> 38:03.823
-Thank you.

38:03.906 --> 38:06.993
-Okay. Anna, no, no work tonight.

38:07.076 --> 38:08.035
-Hey.
-Put it down.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.454
Okay. Now, one, two, three.

38:10.538 --> 38:13.207
-Wait, cheers!
-Cheers! Okay.

38:15.501 --> 38:17.378
-That'll do!
-Oh, my God.

38:19.255 --> 38:22.174
-Work it, girl. Come on, girl. Feel it.
-Um…

38:22.258 --> 38:25.886
Excuse me.
Bartender, can we have another shot?

38:25.970 --> 38:29.724
-Oh, another shot? Okay, girl.

38:30.891 --> 38:31.851
To ADF!

38:31.934 --> 38:33.853
To ADF!

39:09.597 --> 39:12.641
-Is he cute?
-So cute.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.602
What you waiting for? Shoot your shot.

39:14.685 --> 39:18.314
No, he's a loser.
Why hasn't he made the move?

39:20.441 --> 39:22.234
-Anna!
-What?

39:23.444 --> 39:25.279
What? It's still cold.

39:34.038 --> 39:38.751
Now tell me this ain't better
than all those suits and bros.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.587
You guys are better looking,
that's for sure.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.091
Okay, everyone, get in.

39:50.930 --> 39:51.764
Rachel!

39:52.807 --> 39:54.809
Rachel, who are you texting?

40:09.323 --> 40:11.992
I'm really, really drunk, I think.

40:17.998 --> 40:19.917
-Mmm-hmm.

40:24.672 --> 40:25.506
Anna.

40:25.589 --> 40:26.465
Hmm?

40:28.509 --> 40:30.094
How come you give away so much?

40:31.262 --> 40:32.972
Clothes, tips.

40:34.306 --> 40:35.641
It makes me happy.

40:36.725 --> 40:38.936
You don't have to
waste your money on people.

40:39.019 --> 40:43.357
I mean, you don't got to buy anyone.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.609
It's there to be spent.

40:46.485 --> 40:50.531
I love making money.
I love working for it.

40:52.741 --> 40:54.743
If I have it to share, why not?

41:00.749 --> 41:02.585
When I was a kid, I…

41:04.462 --> 41:06.338
I didn't have anything.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.968
And these girls made me feel…

41:13.637 --> 41:14.472
Ah…

41:15.639 --> 41:21.604
Anyway, what's the point to money
if you don't do things with it?

41:21.687 --> 41:23.772
Your dad didn't always have money?

41:25.107 --> 41:29.069
No, he did. I mean, I didn't mean it…

41:29.653 --> 41:34.700
I meant he was really strict,
and he wouldn't let me spend it.

41:35.743 --> 41:39.371
And I couldn't shop or anything.

41:40.706 --> 41:45.586
He wanted me to learn to do it for myself.
Make my own money.

41:47.546 --> 41:51.759
Man, your parents must be really proud.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.513
And what about you?

41:56.722 --> 41:58.057
What are your parents like?

41:58.140 --> 41:59.016
Hmm…

42:00.309 --> 42:01.519
Mainly Mom and me.

42:02.561 --> 42:04.146
We've always been super close.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.190
Like close, like…

42:07.358 --> 42:10.194
pretzels wrapped up
in each other's business.

42:13.739 --> 42:17.159
I came to New York
to figure out who I am without her.

42:17.243 --> 42:18.160
And?

42:19.078 --> 42:20.329
Who are you?

42:26.085 --> 42:29.088
I want to be a director. Like I said.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.093
Then what are you waiting for?

42:35.803 --> 42:38.013
It's not that easy for normal people.

42:38.889 --> 42:41.559
I need money and rent, and…

42:42.393 --> 42:43.894
-that takes time.
-Ugh.

42:44.687 --> 42:45.980
Bullshit.

42:46.063 --> 42:49.358
If it's important enough,
we do the things we want to do.

42:49.441 --> 42:51.026
We don't all have trust funds.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.362
I don't have your security.

42:53.445 --> 42:57.074
I work for everything I have.

42:57.157 --> 42:58.576
What does Kacy say?

42:59.910 --> 43:01.579
Leap and a parachute will appear.

43:01.662 --> 43:05.040
Black girl from DC
don't have a waiting parachute.

43:06.625 --> 43:07.835
You know, not like you.

43:12.339 --> 43:13.716
Did you fall asleep?

43:15.384 --> 43:16.218
Anna?

43:25.102 --> 43:27.438
<i>She was chasing a story.</i>

43:27.521 --> 43:30.024
You ever been to dinner
and not looked at the bill?

43:30.816 --> 43:31.692
No.

43:32.234 --> 43:34.069
-Be quiet.
-Me either.

43:35.029 --> 43:36.280
<i>I feel like a…</i>

43:37.489 --> 43:38.782
-You done?
<i>-I was young…</i>

43:39.325 --> 43:41.410
I told you, I'm going to watch it twice.

43:42.870 --> 43:45.247
<i>…promising me all this publicity. I…</i>

43:45.331 --> 43:47.207
-You heard of Martin Shkreli?
-Viv!

43:48.125 --> 43:51.045
Wait, you mean the guy
who totally disrespected the Wu Tang Clan?

43:52.046 --> 43:52.921
What?

43:53.005 --> 43:55.174
-Just watch.
-Then stop talking to me.

43:57.426 --> 44:00.512
<i>I wanted to be</i>
<i>who she wanted me to be…</i>

44:02.431 --> 44:03.265
I'm finished.

44:04.433 --> 44:08.854
Just be brutally honest.

44:08.937 --> 44:10.606
-I'm not watching, so you have…
-Viv…

44:10.689 --> 44:12.399
…to tell me, if you love me at all--

44:12.483 --> 44:14.526
Viv! Okay.

44:15.486 --> 44:16.945
Um…

44:17.029 --> 44:18.280
It's not all about you.

44:19.406 --> 44:21.950
It's about a lot of things,
you are one of many stories.

44:22.701 --> 44:25.037
But unlike those other stories,

44:25.120 --> 44:28.374
where people clearly declined
to be interviewed,

44:28.999 --> 44:32.127
yours has the victim on camera
telling what happened.

44:32.211 --> 44:35.005
He's not a victim! He's a liar!

44:35.089 --> 44:38.342
That might be true out here, Vivian,
but on the screen…

44:39.176 --> 44:41.845
When he tells America
that he said what you wanted to hear,

44:41.929 --> 44:44.014
that you didn't care about the facts,

44:44.765 --> 44:47.851
that you just wanted clickbait,
that he wasn't even 16 years old…

44:47.935 --> 44:49.978
-…you're the liar.

45:12.167 --> 45:13.419
-Here.

45:14.378 --> 45:15.546
Come here.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.178
This is really bad.

45:25.180 --> 45:26.890
Yeah, I'm not going to lie. It is.

45:30.477 --> 45:33.689
Do I do the interview,
do I not do the interview? What do I do?

45:36.567 --> 45:37.568
I don't know.

45:45.075 --> 45:46.243
Spa…

45:47.161 --> 45:50.914
nail salon, shopping, shopping,
dinner, dinner, nail salon again,

45:50.998 --> 45:52.916
dinner, Kendrick Lamar concert.

45:54.418 --> 45:57.629
Nail salon again, dinner, dinner.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.923
Okay, I appreciate your concern.

46:00.007 --> 46:03.385
It's very whatever, but I'm fine. Really.

46:03.469 --> 46:06.472
It's not a big deal.
So please stop caring about me.

46:07.306 --> 46:08.182
It's horrifying.

46:08.265 --> 46:10.392
Hey, it's not like
I want to care about you.

46:10.476 --> 46:12.269
I didn't even want you in Scriberia,

46:12.352 --> 46:15.355
but you're here, have a filthy mouth,
you're not a revolting millennial,

46:15.439 --> 46:16.648
so fuck you, I care!

46:16.732 --> 46:19.902
Hey, kid, Maud and I
already filed our stories,

46:19.985 --> 46:21.862
so our time is yours.

46:21.945 --> 46:24.239
Not me. I have a big one to write.

46:24.323 --> 46:26.450
Trump is threatening
to overthrow our democracy.

46:26.533 --> 46:30.120
He threatens to overthrow democracy every
ten minutes. He'll do it again tomorrow.

46:30.204 --> 46:34.583
We are all here for you,
so if you need to talk about it, let's--

46:34.666 --> 46:36.043
No. Just stop.

46:36.627 --> 46:37.544
I'm working.

46:38.045 --> 46:40.172
I've got two boxes of financial documents

46:40.255 --> 46:42.633
from Anna's stay
at the 12 George to decipher.

46:46.220 --> 46:47.054
Yeah.

46:57.648 --> 46:59.525
I don't get the mani-pedi thing.

46:59.608 --> 47:02.861
They put polish on them.
75 bucks a pop for nails.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.030
They're nails.

47:05.113 --> 47:09.076
Does the nail polish give the nails
the ability to solve crimes or something?

47:09.159 --> 47:10.577
What is a "Yeezy"?

47:10.661 --> 47:12.996
Yeezies are not for you.
These are all for clothes.

47:13.080 --> 47:16.458
Apparently, we should
all want something called Supreme.

47:16.542 --> 47:19.002
These purses cost more than my first car.

47:19.086 --> 47:22.506
And don't forget, she was tipping
everyone at the hotel in $100 bills.

47:22.589 --> 47:25.175
Anna was spending
thousands of dollars a day.

47:25.259 --> 47:26.093
Nonstop.

47:26.176 --> 47:29.012
Like she can't get rid of it fast enough.
Who lives like this?

47:29.096 --> 47:31.139
We are definitely
through the looking glass here.

47:31.223 --> 47:33.934
What was wrong with her?
Something had to be wrong.

47:34.017 --> 47:35.602
Before it was someone else's money,

47:35.686 --> 47:37.688
but this is her own money
she's running through.

47:37.771 --> 47:41.567
Either she's supremely confident
that this ADF thing is going to happen

47:41.650 --> 47:45.445
or this is one last gasp of freedom
before the fall.

47:45.529 --> 47:48.156
If you ask Neff,
Anna was a woman on the rise.

47:48.240 --> 47:51.118
And she was taking Neff along
for the journey.

47:51.785 --> 47:52.619
Look.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.747
Neff looks like
she's loving every minute of it.

47:55.831 --> 47:58.417
She said it was really good for a while.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.460
For a while. What happened?

48:05.382 --> 48:06.675
Neff! How are you?

48:06.758 --> 48:09.845
Hey, Charlie, Gaby.
Anything I can help you with today?

48:09.928 --> 48:11.763
We're good. Got some meetings upstairs.

48:11.847 --> 48:14.975
Buzz me if you need anything.
I've been looking after Anna too.

48:15.809 --> 48:17.394
-Who?
-Anna Delvey.

48:17.477 --> 48:20.147
Your dad's client. She's leasing 281 Park.

48:20.230 --> 48:22.733
No, I don't think so. What room is she in?

48:22.816 --> 48:23.692
517.

48:23.775 --> 48:26.194
Neff. Would my dad
have a client in the deluxe,

48:26.278 --> 48:27.613
or would he put them in a suite?

48:28.196 --> 48:29.656
Oh, right. My mistake.

48:47.007 --> 48:50.093
I'm so proud of myself.
Hungover and still no carbs.

48:52.179 --> 48:53.972
The Rosen brothers just came in.

48:54.056 --> 48:54.973
Oh!

48:55.891 --> 48:58.352
They said they didn't know your name.

48:58.435 --> 48:59.770
Why would they?

48:59.853 --> 49:01.939
You're leasing a building from them.

49:02.022 --> 49:04.733
-I'm not leasing a building from them.
-From their dad.

49:07.235 --> 49:09.696
Anna, if you're
doing business with their dad,

49:09.780 --> 49:12.741
how come you're not staying
in one of the suites?

49:17.663 --> 49:20.290
You know when you have someone
do so many favors,

49:20.374 --> 49:22.834
you just want to pay them back in silence?

49:30.842 --> 49:31.677
Genius.

49:37.057 --> 49:38.558
Thompsons just checked out.

49:46.191 --> 49:47.025
What's wrong?

49:47.109 --> 49:50.362
Someone failed to get a credit card
on file when Anna Delvey checked in.

49:50.445 --> 49:51.947
Ooh, someone fucked up.

49:52.030 --> 49:54.700
It was those new credit card machines.
They weren't working.

49:54.783 --> 49:56.952
Jeannot, you said
not to bother the guests.

49:57.035 --> 49:58.954
Hmm, you did say that, Jeannot.

49:59.037 --> 50:02.040
I didn't say don't get
a card number at all. We need a card.

50:02.708 --> 50:04.126
Why are you looking at me?

50:04.209 --> 50:06.378
You're the one
who's fraternizing with her.

50:06.461 --> 50:08.338
You need to be better
at covering your mess.

50:08.922 --> 50:11.758
Now I need you to go
find our grown-ass German Eloise

50:11.842 --> 50:12.843
and solve the problem.

50:12.926 --> 50:14.928
She's your friend.
Make sure it's not awkward.

50:15.012 --> 50:16.847
Fine. Don't look so scared.

50:16.930 --> 50:19.224
This is my ass, you know.
If this isn't fixed--

50:19.307 --> 50:21.810
She's good for the money. I got this.

50:21.893 --> 50:23.145
-You'll do it?
-Yeah.

50:23.228 --> 50:25.772
Just remember
who's the one cleaning up your mess.

50:31.403 --> 50:36.116
Banks are the worst.
Everything's taking so fucking long.

50:36.199 --> 50:38.910
My loan should have been approved
like weeks ago.

50:38.994 --> 50:41.705
It's a lot of money.
Guess they've got to cover their bases.

50:41.788 --> 50:43.415
It's not like I'm a high risk.

50:44.666 --> 50:46.376
Shit, I almost forgot.

50:46.460 --> 50:49.337
Management noticed that
you didn't have a credit card on file.

50:49.421 --> 50:53.133
They need you to put one down.
Jeannot is shitting himself.

50:55.385 --> 50:59.347
Uh, sure. Remind me when we get back.
This stuff is so stressful.

51:00.265 --> 51:02.893
Hi, I'm sorry, ma'am, uh,
this card has been declined.

51:03.477 --> 51:04.394
Are you sure?

51:04.478 --> 51:05.812
Oh.

51:06.772 --> 51:08.273
European cards.

51:08.857 --> 51:09.691
Uh…

51:11.401 --> 51:14.738
Try this one.

51:18.950 --> 51:21.244
American banking is so ancient.

51:21.328 --> 51:24.372
How do you guys not use
contactless and chip and pin?

51:24.456 --> 51:27.042
What the fuck is chip and pin?
We have Apple Pay.

51:28.043 --> 51:33.715
Ugh. I'm going to need a vacation
once this loan and lease stuff is handled.

51:34.591 --> 51:36.802
Um… This one didn't go through either.

51:38.136 --> 51:41.890
Seriously? Run it again.
This must be your system.

51:41.973 --> 51:43.183
Our system is fine.

51:43.266 --> 51:46.103
Run it again. These cards are fine.

51:46.186 --> 51:47.437
Uh…

51:47.521 --> 51:48.647
I don't like your tone.

51:48.730 --> 51:51.525
I need a working card
so I can close out this table.

51:51.608 --> 51:52.984
I want to see your manager.

51:53.068 --> 51:54.736
I am the manager.

52:00.617 --> 52:02.994
-Why don't I get this one?
-What? Neff, no.

52:03.995 --> 52:05.831
It's… Here. Okay.

52:05.914 --> 52:07.415
-Neff! Neff! Stop.
-It's okay.

52:07.499 --> 52:10.210
It's no big deal.
It's probably their machines.

52:12.003 --> 52:13.130
All right.

52:14.756 --> 52:15.715
Right.

52:17.801 --> 52:20.929
The food was so gross here anyway,
we're never coming back.

52:22.013 --> 52:23.682
I'll Venmo you the money tonight.

52:25.016 --> 52:26.226
Fuck this place.

52:27.686 --> 52:28.687
Come on.

52:32.399 --> 52:34.067
Stop looking at me like that.

52:34.151 --> 52:36.319
Can you say something? I'm shook.

52:36.403 --> 52:37.612
You don't want me to.

52:37.696 --> 52:41.616
Say something 'cause staring at me with
that look isn't gonna get you anywhere.

52:42.242 --> 52:43.076
Fine.

52:43.660 --> 52:46.746
I told you.
I told you this chick was not right.

52:46.830 --> 52:50.750
She said her dad sometimes
doesn't put his allowance in her account--

52:50.834 --> 52:51.835
Bullshit.

52:51.918 --> 52:54.880
She didn't pay her hotel bill
and now she stiffed you for dinner.

52:54.963 --> 52:58.425
I mean, this is not how an heiress moves.
This is how a hustler moves.

52:58.508 --> 53:00.177
Idiot, you are from Santa Barbara.

53:00.260 --> 53:01.928
You don't know shit about hustle,

53:02.012 --> 53:04.264
so don't start
with your made-up "I'm gangsta" bull.

53:04.347 --> 53:07.392
Saw too many Spike Lee movies,
now you think you know something.

53:07.475 --> 53:10.145
Your friend stuck you
with a dinner bill you can't afford.

53:10.228 --> 53:13.982
She got you so wrapped around her finger,
you vouched for this bitch to your boss.

53:14.065 --> 53:15.775
You still don't have her credit card.

53:16.693 --> 53:19.237
You know what I learned from Spike?
You've been had.

53:19.863 --> 53:21.615
Hoodwinked. Bamboozled.

53:22.115 --> 53:22.949
Boo,

53:24.075 --> 53:26.703
you're supposed to be
riding this train to your film.

53:26.786 --> 53:28.955
I don't see no film
and now you're out of pocket.

53:33.501 --> 53:34.336
Neff,

53:36.296 --> 53:37.881
it's time to open up your eyes.

53:45.764 --> 53:47.015
…art and technology,

53:47.098 --> 53:50.101
I think it's really important,
a part of ADF.

53:50.185 --> 53:52.395
And it's an important part for me,
in a way.

53:52.479 --> 53:55.607
Like I have such an artist's heart…

54:00.111 --> 54:01.112
Neff.

54:01.196 --> 54:02.030
Neff!

54:02.113 --> 54:03.240
Neff, are you listening?

54:04.908 --> 54:07.202
I still need to get your credit card.

54:08.036 --> 54:08.870
Oh.

54:08.954 --> 54:10.080
Sure. I mean, whenever.

54:10.163 --> 54:11.915
I'm going shopping. Want to come with me?

54:11.998 --> 54:14.209
-Meet me on your lunch?
-I need it today.

54:14.876 --> 54:16.002
Need what?

54:16.086 --> 54:19.798
Your credit card. It's management. On me.

54:21.174 --> 54:22.592
Sure, later.

54:22.676 --> 54:25.220
I mean, I'd get it now,
but housekeeping's in my room.

54:25.720 --> 54:29.057
Those broke bitches
are always in my space hoping for a tip.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.186
Don't call them that.

54:33.270 --> 54:34.187
What?

54:34.938 --> 54:38.275
I mean, they're hardworking women.
Don't disrespect them.

54:40.694 --> 54:42.904
Sure. Whatever.

54:45.740 --> 54:47.117
What's up with you today?

54:55.458 --> 54:56.293
Uh-uh.

54:56.376 --> 54:57.711
I've got a full house tonight.

54:57.794 --> 55:00.588
I was just checking
that everything's okay with Anna?

55:00.672 --> 55:01.589
What do you mean?

55:01.673 --> 55:05.260
No, nothing. I just…
She's paying and everything, right?

55:05.343 --> 55:07.053
I mean, there's no problems?

55:07.137 --> 55:09.723
Fine as far as I know.
She pays her dinner checks.

55:09.806 --> 55:12.517
Okay. Great.
So her credit card's working then?

55:12.600 --> 55:14.477
Oh, you know about that nightmare, huh?

55:14.561 --> 55:16.146
Yeah. Of course.

55:16.813 --> 55:19.941
-Which part are you talking about?
-Her credit card getting hacked.

55:20.025 --> 55:21.026
Uh-huh.

55:21.109 --> 55:24.279
She's been signing the dinner bills
to her room the last few weeks,

55:24.362 --> 55:26.656
so there's no issue on our end,

55:26.740 --> 55:29.576
but if you want,
I can give you a copy of the charges.

55:29.659 --> 55:33.330
I'm not gonna lie to you,
it is the length of a CVS receipt.

55:33.413 --> 55:34.497
It's a big bill.

55:41.629 --> 55:42.464
<i>Hello?</i>

55:42.547 --> 55:45.675
Hey, Charlie, it's me,
Neff from 12 George.

55:45.759 --> 55:47.886
-<i>What's up?</i>
-Everything's cool.

55:47.969 --> 55:51.139
I just had a question
about that guest of mine, Anna,

55:51.222 --> 55:52.390
who's leasing 281.

55:52.849 --> 55:55.060
<i>You know, I checked about that.</i>

55:55.518 --> 55:56.978
<i>My dad never heard of her.</i>

55:57.103 --> 55:58.730
<i>Maybe she made inquiries.</i>

55:59.022 --> 56:02.067
<i>A whole bunch of people</i>
<i>toured that place, but…</i>

56:02.233 --> 56:03.234
Thanks, Charlie.

56:37.435 --> 56:38.269
Hey, Neff.

56:43.400 --> 56:46.403
-What do you think about these?
-Aby Rosen has never heard of you.

56:47.070 --> 56:49.823
-What are you talking about?
-What the fuck is going on?

56:49.906 --> 56:52.992
Aby has never heard of you,
but you say you're leasing his building.

56:53.910 --> 56:55.161
What are you going on about?

56:55.245 --> 56:57.831
Anna, I'm on the line here, okay?

56:58.331 --> 56:59.541
No one has heard of you.

56:59.624 --> 57:03.378
I put you on every list.
I put you on the VIP board.

57:03.461 --> 57:05.422
You won't put a credit card
down at the hotel.

57:05.505 --> 57:08.466
Your cards don't even work.
I paid for that dinner.

57:08.550 --> 57:13.263
I'm broke and I need this job
and your bill is over $30,000.

57:16.641 --> 57:17.767
Be straight with me.

57:19.394 --> 57:21.813
-You're being so crazy and dramatic.
-Stop right there.

57:21.896 --> 57:25.358
If you're a hustler, cool, do your hustle.
But leave me the fuck out of it.

57:25.442 --> 57:26.484
I have rent to pay.

57:26.568 --> 57:29.404
I have real life shit
that I have to deal with.

57:29.487 --> 57:32.907
I have plans
and I will not go down with you.

57:32.991 --> 57:34.200
Do you hear me?

57:35.368 --> 57:36.578
Handle your business.

57:47.338 --> 57:48.506
I had the best day.

57:48.590 --> 57:51.301
Sculpture I'm working on,
it's finally coming together,

57:51.384 --> 57:52.677
-which is…
-Hmm!

57:52.760 --> 57:54.679
I've been staring at this thing
for so long

57:54.762 --> 57:56.431
and suddenly, it's like a switch…

57:57.307 --> 57:58.933
flipped in my brain

58:00.602 --> 58:03.980
and I see a whole new…

58:05.440 --> 58:07.901
-What is different?
-My hair. You like it?

58:09.110 --> 58:10.528
I like it if you like it.

58:10.612 --> 58:11.613
Jack.

58:11.696 --> 58:14.824
Honey, if it makes you feel better
about all this Donovan Lamb stuff…

58:14.908 --> 58:16.701
This is not about Donovan Lamb.

58:17.744 --> 58:19.996
I just want an opinion from you
on my fucking hair.

58:21.539 --> 58:22.373
Vivi,

58:23.583 --> 58:25.543
you could shave your head
and I would love it.

58:25.627 --> 58:27.795
Okay? I didn't marry you for your looks.

58:28.338 --> 58:31.090
You know I only married you
for your boobs and your money.

58:31.174 --> 58:33.051
-What you doing?

58:33.134 --> 58:35.178
Mmm, going over my notes.

58:35.261 --> 58:36.179
You know,

58:36.930 --> 58:41.392
I read this and I think
she must have been terrified.

58:41.476 --> 58:46.064
She had this pot of money she's spending,
living in this hotel,

58:46.147 --> 58:47.982
and it's getting smaller and smaller.

58:48.066 --> 58:50.818
And she was waiting
for the funding to come through for ADF.

58:51.819 --> 58:57.033
She had to believe
that it was really going to happen.

58:57.116 --> 58:59.035
That she was
really going to get the money.

58:59.619 --> 59:00.745
Or why keep spending?

59:01.871 --> 59:06.376
I think she was moving on faith.
I don't know if this was totally a scam.

59:06.459 --> 59:07.585
I think she believed.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.297
Or Neff believed for her?

59:12.048 --> 59:13.508
She believed in her friend.

59:14.551 --> 59:15.468
Yeah.

59:30.275 --> 59:32.944
-You can't do this.
-Let's take this…

59:33.027 --> 59:35.738
I'm not going anywhere.
Fix my key. Let me in my room.

59:35.822 --> 59:38.449
-What happened?
-How could you let them do this to me?

59:38.533 --> 59:41.828
-Jeannot, what did you do?
-Fucking locked me out of my room.

59:41.911 --> 59:43.788
Until Ms. Delvey
pays her outstanding bill,

59:43.871 --> 59:45.331
we're confiscating her belongings.

59:45.415 --> 59:46.624
Do you know who I am?

59:46.708 --> 59:48.334
-What I could do to you?
-Jeannot.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.086
I want my stuff!

59:50.169 --> 59:51.754
You owe us $30,000.

59:51.838 --> 59:53.339
Oh, wow. Oh.

59:53.423 --> 59:59.178
I bet you feel so big standing in
your shitty little hotel.

59:59.262 --> 1:00:03.224
Neff, please, I need to get
my stuff. You know I'll pay the bill.

1:00:03.308 --> 1:00:05.184
-Anna, if I--
-Don't talk to her.

1:00:05.268 --> 1:00:06.936
No payment, no key card.

1:00:09.897 --> 1:00:14.485
Neff, please, I need to get my stuff.
All my business paperwork is in there.

1:00:14.569 --> 1:00:16.571
My passport. I need to get my passport.

1:00:16.654 --> 1:00:17.739
Anna, I'm sorry.

1:00:21.993 --> 1:00:23.411
You know I pay my debts.

1:00:25.121 --> 1:00:26.080
I can't help you.

1:00:40.845 --> 1:00:42.930
Hi, Paul asked me to check.

1:00:43.014 --> 1:00:45.099
<i>America Investigated</i> needs an answer.

1:00:45.183 --> 1:00:47.935
They have to shoot Thursday
to make their deadline. So…

1:00:48.436 --> 1:00:49.270
Thanks.

1:00:49.354 --> 1:00:51.564
Thanks, you've decided, or…

1:00:51.648 --> 1:00:52.565
Thanks.

1:00:53.900 --> 1:00:54.734
Got it.

1:01:17.423 --> 1:01:18.341
Hey.

1:01:18.424 --> 1:01:19.842
I'm going to die here.

1:01:19.926 --> 1:01:23.513
McCaw sent over more boxes,
more bills, more receipts.

1:01:23.596 --> 1:01:26.683
I need to get through everything
to even just get started.

1:01:26.766 --> 1:01:30.311
This is… Anna's a lot. You know?

1:01:31.646 --> 1:01:34.190
Who visits her? In Rikers?

1:01:36.317 --> 1:01:37.902
You and me. We're it.

1:01:37.985 --> 1:01:41.197
She wanted to know
who hurt my feelings. Anna.

1:01:41.906 --> 1:01:44.784
It's none of her business.
It feels dangerous to tell her anything.

1:01:44.867 --> 1:01:48.079
There are as many days
as I think she's Hannibal Lecter

1:01:48.162 --> 1:01:51.290
as there are days I think
she's just your average twentysomething.

1:01:52.375 --> 1:01:53.960
She knew my feelings were hurt.

1:01:58.131 --> 1:02:00.800
My wife watches <i>America Investigated.</i>

1:02:13.479 --> 1:02:17.525
It's not so much the public shaming part.
It's not that. It…

1:02:19.026 --> 1:02:20.570
It'll follow me. Forever.

1:02:21.237 --> 1:02:22.613
I don't get job offers anymore.

1:02:22.697 --> 1:02:24.741
I got asked about it
in my co-op interview.

1:02:25.450 --> 1:02:28.995
But it's not that. It's…

1:02:30.663 --> 1:02:31.581
What?

1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:34.959
Paul was my editor.

1:02:36.836 --> 1:02:38.129
But we were friends.

1:02:39.464 --> 1:02:43.009
I mean, me, Jack, and Paul and Marilyn,

1:02:43.092 --> 1:02:48.306
we rented this shit cabin
in the Catskills every summer together.

1:02:48.389 --> 1:02:52.477
It was horrible,
but it was all we could afford.

1:02:53.269 --> 1:02:55.438
One year, right after the cabin week,

1:02:56.773 --> 1:02:59.025
Paul asks me to do this story.

1:02:59.108 --> 1:03:01.402
It's not even a story. It's a list.

1:03:01.486 --> 1:03:04.322
Thirty reasons to love New York.
A fucking list.

1:03:04.405 --> 1:03:05.364
I almost said no.

1:03:05.448 --> 1:03:08.159
I'd just gotten this new job.
This amazing job.

1:03:08.242 --> 1:03:10.328
This on-air job. The dream.

1:03:11.287 --> 1:03:14.123
But Paul was a friend.

1:03:14.207 --> 1:03:16.209
He needs a hand,
I do it, the fucking list.

1:03:16.292 --> 1:03:17.877
Number 12 on the list--

1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:19.170
Donovan Lamb.

1:03:20.213 --> 1:03:24.133
A kid who made 80 million
on the stock market before he could drive.

1:03:24.217 --> 1:03:26.302
Definitely a reason to love New York.

1:03:26.385 --> 1:03:29.722
I verified, talked to his friends,
his parents,

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:32.099
saw bank statements,

1:03:32.975 --> 1:03:35.603
but I don't know, I had a funny feeling.

1:03:35.686 --> 1:03:38.397
I told Paul, "Something feels off."

1:03:38.481 --> 1:03:40.274
He said just write up,
he'd check it later.

1:03:40.358 --> 1:03:43.319
I wrote it up.
Like I said, he was a friend.

1:03:46.489 --> 1:03:49.492
When "30 Reasons" came out, 12 was there.

1:03:49.575 --> 1:03:51.911
Paul ran it just like I wrote it.

1:03:51.994 --> 1:03:55.373
Only now it had a really sexy headline,

1:03:55.456 --> 1:03:57.667
the kind of headline
that gets the story picked up

1:03:57.750 --> 1:03:59.961
by morning shows and Sunday papers,

1:04:00.044 --> 1:04:01.796
and it would have been fine

1:04:01.879 --> 1:04:05.424
except the kid
never actually had any money.

1:04:07.885 --> 1:04:12.181
Not a dime, which is what
he told the <i>Post</i> in an exclusive

1:04:12.265 --> 1:04:15.685
after telling them I pressured him to lie.

1:04:16.269 --> 1:04:18.604
When Landon, our boss,
asked what happened,

1:04:18.688 --> 1:04:21.440
I told the truth,
and I thought that Paul did too.

1:04:21.524 --> 1:04:24.360
But now, Paul and Marilyn spend two weeks

1:04:24.443 --> 1:04:27.154
on the Vineyard every summer
at Landon's family estate…

1:04:28.489 --> 1:04:29.407
Paul got promoted,

1:04:29.490 --> 1:04:32.535
I got fired from my great new on-air job
before it even started.

1:04:33.953 --> 1:04:39.333
The worst is all of my work friends,
all my colleagues,

1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:45.590
they just disappeared on me.
I was ghosted like that.

1:04:45.673 --> 1:04:49.594
Nobody questioned it.
Nobody had any faith in me.

1:04:51.387 --> 1:04:55.558
I have a stamp on my head.
The bad journalist.

1:04:55.641 --> 1:04:59.061
And everyone's fine with it.
Or they pity me.

1:05:01.397 --> 1:05:02.231
So,

1:05:03.316 --> 1:05:06.193
now the promo drops
and Paul's trying to make up with me

1:05:06.277 --> 1:05:10.156
and I'm fucking creating a life in here,
so I can't even drink about it.

1:05:10.239 --> 1:05:12.950
So I was mean to Anna. Okay?

1:05:14.368 --> 1:05:15.202
Okay.

1:05:19.373 --> 1:05:20.499
I like your hair.

1:05:23.002 --> 1:05:24.378
Subtle but nice.

1:05:25.379 --> 1:05:26.505
Right?

1:05:28.132 --> 1:05:29.383
Thank you.

1:05:30.468 --> 1:05:34.096
I made one of those cheap
1-800-get-a-lawyer commercials last year.

1:05:34.180 --> 1:05:37.183
-It's humiliating. Want to watch it?
-Yes, I very much do.

1:05:38.267 --> 1:05:39.101
Hmm.

1:05:51.197 --> 1:05:52.406
Why you breathing so loud?

1:05:53.032 --> 1:05:54.700
This whole thing's so fucked up.

1:05:56.869 --> 1:05:59.205
Anna's on the street somewhere.
I was so mean to her.

1:05:59.288 --> 1:06:01.374
Lost all that money, can't make my movie.

1:06:07.964 --> 1:06:09.131
Of course you can't.

1:06:10.383 --> 1:06:11.217
What?

1:06:12.718 --> 1:06:15.304
Babe, you've been
making this film for three years

1:06:15.388 --> 1:06:16.889
and you've never shot a thing.

1:06:16.973 --> 1:06:19.016
You got 1,000 reasons
why you can't get shit done,

1:06:19.100 --> 1:06:20.267
and none of them are real.

1:06:20.351 --> 1:06:22.061
-That is not true.
-It is.

1:06:23.813 --> 1:06:25.356
It's not like you're doing anything.

1:06:25.439 --> 1:06:26.941
I finished my novel yesterday.

1:06:27.692 --> 1:06:28.943
And you ain't even asked.

1:06:30.653 --> 1:06:33.447
People are making feature films
on their phones now.

1:06:33.990 --> 1:06:36.450
Money's not your problem.
You don't think you can do it.

1:06:36.534 --> 1:06:37.702
That's not…

1:06:41.497 --> 1:06:46.919
Look, that Anna chick might be crazy,
but I agree with her on one thing.

1:06:47.962 --> 1:06:50.589
You want something,
you have to do something about it.

1:06:52.174 --> 1:06:55.177
Stop counting money in a shoebox
inside this apartment.

1:06:56.095 --> 1:06:57.471
Go after what you want.

1:07:12.611 --> 1:07:13.446
Jeannot.

1:07:14.947 --> 1:07:16.032
You wanted to see me?

1:07:22.955 --> 1:07:24.915
-How did you do it?
-Do what?

1:07:24.999 --> 1:07:28.377
Anna Delvey, she paid all of it.
Wire came in this morning.

1:07:32.882 --> 1:07:34.091
I yelled at her.

1:07:35.342 --> 1:07:38.345
I let you throw her out. I told you.

1:07:39.180 --> 1:07:45.811
I told you! Anna is the real thing.
Anna's legit! You don't know!

1:08:00.409 --> 1:08:02.119
Anna!

1:08:07.166 --> 1:08:08.417
The money I owe you.

1:08:12.088 --> 1:08:14.757
I'm sorry about what I said.
I should not have accused you.

1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:18.677
Get away from all these basic bitches.
You're better than this place, Neff.

1:08:20.054 --> 1:08:22.473
I'm taking a trip. Somewhere fun.

1:08:23.099 --> 1:08:24.100
You want to come?

1:08:27.436 --> 1:08:30.689
I can't. I don't have any more days off.

1:08:31.315 --> 1:08:33.984
I need this job. This is my life, Anna.

1:08:37.780 --> 1:08:39.532
Life is for living, you know.

1:08:40.658 --> 1:08:41.575
Bye, Neff.

1:08:52.628 --> 1:08:53.671
-Neff.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:08:56.006 --> 1:08:56.924
It was you.

1:08:57.925 --> 1:08:59.093
What?

1:08:59.176 --> 1:09:03.055
She stayed at the hotel so long
because of you.

1:09:03.139 --> 1:09:06.225
You're the only person
she paid back in full.

1:09:07.351 --> 1:09:09.603
I think she stayed there
because she had you.

1:09:12.356 --> 1:09:13.858
Kacy, she paid to be there.

1:09:15.025 --> 1:09:16.944
And Rachel…

1:09:19.572 --> 1:09:21.824
But after a while,
I wasn't there for the tips.

1:09:21.907 --> 1:09:23.159
I was there because…

1:09:26.203 --> 1:09:27.037
I liked her.

1:09:30.875 --> 1:09:31.876
I miss her.

1:09:44.847 --> 1:09:45.848
Coming?

1:09:48.184 --> 1:09:51.437
You go ahead. I've got something…

1:09:52.062 --> 1:09:52.897
Okay.

1:10:03.490 --> 1:10:04.325
No.

1:10:06.744 --> 1:10:08.579
-What?
-No.

1:10:09.830 --> 1:10:11.457
You wanna set the record straight,

1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:14.251
you explain how you fucked up
and threw me under the bus,

1:10:14.335 --> 1:10:17.671
and left my reputation with this stink
on it so you could save yourself.

1:10:17.755 --> 1:10:21.258
-I never meant to ever--
-You did mean to.

1:10:24.970 --> 1:10:27.848
We were friends, Paul.

1:10:28.933 --> 1:10:30.476
I believed in you.

1:10:31.685 --> 1:10:36.774
You made a choice
to hurt me for your own personal gain.

1:10:38.943 --> 1:10:40.653
You are not innocent.

1:11:07.471 --> 1:11:09.014
I wasn't expecting you.

1:11:10.099 --> 1:11:10.975
How are you?

1:11:11.725 --> 1:11:12.559
Mmm.

1:11:12.643 --> 1:11:13.936
They don't have saunas in here.

1:11:18.274 --> 1:11:19.316
How are you?

1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:24.738
Good. Still at 12 George,
but I've been shooting my film.

1:11:24.822 --> 1:11:26.156
On weekends.

1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:28.450
Fuck yeah! Yeah.

1:11:29.660 --> 1:11:31.453
Okay. Tell me everything.

1:11:31.537 --> 1:11:34.707
Okay, so it's on my phone,
but it looks pretty good.

1:11:34.790 --> 1:11:36.625
And I'm filming some of it at the hotel.

1:11:36.709 --> 1:11:38.502
I bet Jeannot loves that.

1:11:39.044 --> 1:11:41.255
Jeannot, he's not so bad.

1:11:41.338 --> 1:11:45.509
I mean, he's still on me all the time,
but you know the muppet?

1:11:45.592 --> 1:11:47.636
-Yeah.
-She quit.

1:11:48.971 --> 1:11:50.180
Shit, really?
