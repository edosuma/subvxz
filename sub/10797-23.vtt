00:01.166 --> 00:06.083
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:01.166 --> 00:06.083
<i>Stardate 41697.9.</i>

00:06.083 --> 00:09.583
<i>We're en route to Sarona VIII</i>

00:06.083 --> 00:09.583
<i>for much-needed shore leave.</i>

00:09.583 --> 00:12.041
<i>The entire crew is looking</i>

00:09.583 --> 00:12.041
<i>forward to the diversion.</i>

00:12.041 --> 00:13.709
<i>On a personal note</i>

00:13.709 --> 00:17.875
<i>I have allowed myself</i>

00:13.709 --> 00:17.875
<i>the luxury of a head start.</i>

00:21.875 --> 00:23.166
(<i> beeping</i> )

00:28.083 --> 00:29.458
I took advantage.

00:29.458 --> 00:32.959
No, no, Lieutenant.

00:29.458 --> 00:32.959
The advantage was yours.

00:32.959 --> 00:34.959
Come again.

00:40.333 --> 00:41.875
En garde.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.083
(<i> beeping</i> )

01:15.500 --> 01:16.917
Interesting move, sir.

01:16.917 --> 01:18.375
What technique

01:16.917 --> 01:18.375
was that?

01:18.375 --> 01:21.875
The technique

01:18.375 --> 01:21.875
of a desperate man.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.250
Interesting move,

01:22.875 --> 01:24.250
sir.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.875
What technique

01:24.250 --> 01:25.875
was that?

01:25.875 --> 01:28.792
The technique

01:25.875 --> 01:28.792
of a desperate man.

01:28.792 --> 01:30.917
Captain...

01:30.917 --> 01:32.875
what was that?

01:38.875 --> 01:40.208
Picard to Bridge.

01:40.208 --> 01:41.792
RIKER:

01:40.208 --> 01:41.792
Captain.

01:41.792 --> 01:43.750
Number One,

01:41.792 --> 01:43.750
did something unusual

01:43.750 --> 01:45.208
just occur

01:43.750 --> 01:45.208
on the Bridge?

01:45.208 --> 01:48.834
Yes, sir. We experienced

01:45.208 --> 01:48.834
some kind of loop

01:48.834 --> 01:51.208
where everything

01:48.834 --> 01:51.208
repeats itself.

01:51.208 --> 01:53.208
Here, too.

01:53.208 --> 01:55.208
I'm on my way.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.792
Report, Mr. Data.

02:03.792 --> 02:05.750
Sensors show nothing, sir

02:05.750 --> 02:07.834
but it appears

02:05.750 --> 02:07.834
a moment in time

02:07.834 --> 02:09.583
repeated itself

02:07.834 --> 02:09.583
exactly.

02:09.583 --> 02:10.667
For everyone.

02:10.667 --> 02:12.709
It was like a feeling

02:10.667 --> 02:12.709
of<i> deja vu.</i>

02:12.709 --> 02:14.625
Reports coming in

02:12.709 --> 02:14.625
from all decks, sir.

02:14.625 --> 02:15.959
Computers were

02:14.625 --> 02:15.959
also affected, sir

02:15.959 --> 02:17.083
which would indicate

02:17.083 --> 02:18.875
the phenomenon was

02:17.083 --> 02:18.875
not an illusion

02:18.875 --> 02:20.208
but occurred

02:18.875 --> 02:20.208
in real time.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.750
Number One

02:21.750 --> 02:25.125
find out if anything

02:21.750 --> 02:25.125
similar happened

02:21.750 --> 02:25.125
in this sector.

02:26.792 --> 02:28.834
Sir, I am receiving

02:26.792 --> 02:28.834
an emergency transmission

02:28.834 --> 02:30.500
from the Pegos Minor System.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.458
Put it on.

02:32.458 --> 02:35.458
...542.2.

02:35.458 --> 02:39.458
I repeat, this is

02:35.458 --> 02:39.458
Dr. Paul Manheim.

02:39.458 --> 02:42.208
We are in need of help.

02:42.208 --> 02:46.500
Urgent. All ships,

02:42.208 --> 02:46.500
please respond.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.917
I repeat,

02:47.917 --> 02:53.834
coordinates are 66728.9

02:53.834 --> 02:57.667
by 7075...

02:57.667 --> 02:59.417
It is an automated signal, sir.

02:59.417 --> 03:01.500
I am unable

02:59.417 --> 03:01.500
to establish contact.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.834
This is Dr. Paul Manheim.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.417
Shut it off.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.959
Mr. La Forge, lay in a course

03:04.417 --> 03:06.959
on those coordinates.

03:06.959 --> 03:08.625
Aye, sir.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.291
Captain, you act

03:08.625 --> 03:11.291
as if there's a connection

03:11.291 --> 03:12.333
between the time distortion

03:12.333 --> 03:13.750
and the distress

03:12.333 --> 03:13.750
signal.

03:13.750 --> 03:17.125
There is.

03:17.125 --> 03:20.208
Paul Manheim.

03:20.208 --> 03:23.709
15 years ago, he went off

03:20.208 --> 03:23.709
to work on experiments

03:23.709 --> 03:25.792
relating to

03:23.709 --> 03:25.792
non-linear time.

03:25.792 --> 03:27.667
It appears he may

03:25.792 --> 03:27.667
have achieved

03:27.667 --> 03:28.709
some measure

03:27.667 --> 03:28.709
of success.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.750
Speed, warp 8.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.083
Aye, sir.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.083
Warp 8.

03:31.083 --> 03:32.166
Engage.

03:54.667 --> 03:59.000
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
<i>These are the voyages</i>

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.875
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

04:04.875 --> 04:09.208
<i>to explore</i>

04:04.875 --> 04:09.208
<i>strange new worlds</i>

04:09.208 --> 04:13.709
<i>to seek out new life</i>

04:09.208 --> 04:13.709
<i>and new civilizations</i>

04:13.709 --> 04:17.917
<i>to boldly go</i>

04:13.709 --> 04:17.917
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

05:25.250 --> 05:27.083
Estimated arrival,

05:25.250 --> 05:27.083
Pegos Minor--

05:27.083 --> 05:30.250
four hours, 35 minutes,

05:27.083 --> 05:30.250
17 seconds.

05:30.250 --> 05:31.959
I've never heard

05:30.250 --> 05:31.959
of Paul Manheim.

05:31.959 --> 05:33.542
Mr. Data.

05:33.542 --> 05:37.291
A highly respected scientist,

05:33.542 --> 05:37.291
considered a visionary.

05:37.291 --> 05:39.458
He advanced several

05:37.291 --> 05:39.458
time-related theories.

05:39.458 --> 05:42.125
One regarding the relationships

05:39.458 --> 05:42.125
between time and gravity

05:42.125 --> 05:43.875
was quite intriguing.

05:43.875 --> 05:46.375
But neither that theory, nor any

05:43.875 --> 05:46.375
other, received wide acceptance.

05:46.375 --> 05:50.667
15 years ago, he assembled

05:46.375 --> 05:50.667
a team of scientists

05:50.667 --> 05:52.834
to expand that research.

05:52.834 --> 05:53.959
They disappeared.

05:53.959 --> 05:56.000
Haven't been heard from since.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Did you know him,

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Captain?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.917
I knew<i> of</i> him.

05:58.917 --> 06:01.917
He was teaching at the

05:58.917 --> 06:01.917
university when I was in Paris

06:01.917 --> 06:05.000
but I, um...

06:01.917 --> 06:05.000
didn't have the pleasure.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.917
I must change.

06:06.917 --> 06:08.959
Number One, inform me

06:06.917 --> 06:08.959
half an hour

06:08.959 --> 06:10.917
before we reach

06:08.959 --> 06:10.917
those coordinates

06:10.917 --> 06:15.625
and keep trying to determine

06:10.917 --> 06:15.625
if the time distortion

06:15.625 --> 06:17.417
was specifically located

06:15.625 --> 06:17.417
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

06:17.417 --> 06:18.417
Yes, sir.

06:18.417 --> 06:20.000
Captain.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Excuse me.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.875
Yes, what is it,

06:22.000 --> 06:23.875
Counselor?

06:23.875 --> 06:26.917
I think you would prefer

06:23.875 --> 06:26.917
to discuss this in private.

06:26.917 --> 06:29.083
No, that's not necessary.

06:26.917 --> 06:29.083
Go on.

06:29.083 --> 06:32.166
When Professor Manheim's

06:29.083 --> 06:32.166
name was mentioned

06:32.166 --> 06:35.125
you reacted with

06:32.166 --> 06:35.125
intense emotion.

06:35.125 --> 06:37.917
Yes. Please, get

06:35.125 --> 06:37.917
to the point.

06:37.917 --> 06:41.834
I don't want to interfere

06:37.917 --> 06:41.834
with your personal life

06:41.834 --> 06:45.458
but unresolved, strong emotion

06:41.834 --> 06:45.458
can affect judgment.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.500
Well, thank you

06:48.000 --> 06:50.500
for your concern.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.834
As Ship's Counselor,

06:50.500 --> 06:53.834
I offer my assistance.

06:53.834 --> 06:56.542
What do you suggest?

06:56.542 --> 07:02.375
Confronting deep personal

06:56.542 --> 07:02.375
issues is not easy for you.

07:02.375 --> 07:03.750
You tend to suppress them.

07:03.750 --> 07:07.125
There are a few hours

07:03.750 --> 07:07.125
until we arrive.

07:07.125 --> 07:11.375
Perhaps you should use this

07:07.125 --> 07:11.375
time to analyze your feelings

07:11.375 --> 07:13.125
and put them

07:11.375 --> 07:13.125
into perspective.

07:13.125 --> 07:14.500
Thank you, Counselor.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.875
If I should need you further,

07:14.500 --> 07:16.875
I'll let you know.

07:48.834 --> 07:50.792
Bridge.

07:50.792 --> 07:52.792
Belay that.

07:55.792 --> 08:00.083
Computer, estimated arrival

07:55.792 --> 08:00.083
at Pegos Minor?

08:00.083 --> 08:04.083
COMPUTER:

08:00.083 --> 08:04.083
Two hours, nine minutes.

08:04.083 --> 08:07.083
Holodeck Three.

08:16.041 --> 08:17.709
Computer,

08:16.041 --> 08:17.709
this is Captain Picard.

08:17.709 --> 08:19.709
Holodeck Three is clear.

08:19.709 --> 08:22.583
Location: Paris.

08:22.583 --> 08:26.667
Cafe des Artistes

08:22.583 --> 08:26.667
as it appeared...

08:27.667 --> 08:30.667
22 years ago.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.625
April the 9th, 1500 hours...

08:33.625 --> 08:34.667
3:00.

08:34.667 --> 08:39.291
Warm spring day.

08:39.291 --> 08:40.709
COMPUTER:

08:39.291 --> 08:40.709
Program complete.

08:54.375 --> 08:57.417
<i>Monsieur,</i> welcome

08:54.375 --> 08:57.417
to the Cafe des Artistes.

08:57.417 --> 09:01.000
Is this your first time

08:57.417 --> 09:01.000
in Paris?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.083
No.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.500
This way.

09:06.250 --> 09:07.875
That table.

09:07.875 --> 09:11.917
<i>Oh, mais bien sur, Monsieur.</i>

09:07.875 --> 09:11.917
We are here to please you.

09:26.625 --> 09:29.750
I've been away

09:26.625 --> 09:29.750
far too long.

09:29.750 --> 09:32.917
Some wine?

09:29.750 --> 09:32.917
Some cheese?

09:32.917 --> 09:35.375
I'm not very hungry.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.000
I really came

09:35.375 --> 09:38.000
for the view.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.083
Perhaps what you hunger

09:38.000 --> 09:41.083
for is not on the menu.

09:42.709 --> 09:44.333
Perhaps not.

09:45.834 --> 09:49.583
It was many years ago.

09:45.834 --> 09:49.583
I had a rendezvous.

09:49.583 --> 09:52.000
I was to meet

09:49.583 --> 09:52.000
someone...

09:52.000 --> 09:57.083
someone here,

09:52.000 --> 09:57.083
at that very table.

09:58.959 --> 10:02.250
Your young lady,

09:58.959 --> 10:02.250
she did not come?

10:04.333 --> 10:06.667
Actually, I don't know.

10:06.667 --> 10:09.375
I always imagined that she did.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.750
You, however, did not.

10:15.041 --> 10:16.375
Ah.

10:18.959 --> 10:22.250
Well, trust Edouard.

10:22.250 --> 10:26.208
I will bring something

10:22.250 --> 10:26.208
very special, just for you.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.667
Let's go, huh?

10:29.750 --> 10:31.667
We've waited long enough.

10:31.667 --> 10:35.000
Fran, you go.

10:31.667 --> 10:35.000
I'll stay a little longer.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.875
He's not coming,

10:35.000 --> 10:36.875
Gabrielle.

10:36.875 --> 10:39.166
No. After last night,

10:36.875 --> 10:39.166
I know he will.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.208
I just know it.

10:40.208 --> 10:41.375
Then he would

10:40.208 --> 10:41.375
be here.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.959
You're making a fool

10:41.375 --> 10:43.959
out of yourself

10:43.959 --> 10:45.291
and I will

10:43.959 --> 10:45.291
not watch.

10:51.959 --> 10:53.333
Do we know each other?

10:53.333 --> 10:55.291
No.

10:55.291 --> 10:58.125
The way you look at me--

10:55.291 --> 10:58.125
do I remind you of someone?

10:58.125 --> 11:01.125
No.

11:01.125 --> 11:04.208
Yes, you do somewhat.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.542
He's not coming.

11:09.542 --> 11:11.083
Why?

11:11.083 --> 11:13.417
What did I do to drive him away?

11:13.417 --> 11:15.875
Maybe you did nothing.

11:15.875 --> 11:19.041
Maybe he had no choice.

11:19.041 --> 11:21.125
Maybe he was afraid.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.417
Of what? Of me?

11:23.417 --> 11:29.333
Oh, of being connected.

11:23.417 --> 11:29.333
Rooted.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.750
Perhaps, if he's

11:29.333 --> 11:31.750
as young as you are

11:31.750 --> 11:35.875
he doesn't know yet exactly

11:31.750 --> 11:35.875
what it is he wants to do.

11:35.875 --> 11:39.083
Maybe...

11:43.583 --> 11:45.458
Enough of this self-indulgence.

11:46.875 --> 11:49.875
Exit.

12:06.875 --> 12:08.709
Captain, we've

12:06.875 --> 12:08.709
received communication

12:08.709 --> 12:10.166
from the Freighter<i> Lalo</i>

12:10.166 --> 12:12.333
as well as from a farming colony

12:10.166 --> 12:12.333
on Coltar IV.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.375
Both described the

12:12.333 --> 12:14.375
same time distortion.

12:14.375 --> 12:17.500
The Captain of the<i> Lalo</i>

12:14.375 --> 12:17.500
described it as a hiccup.

12:17.500 --> 12:18.875
Hiccup?

12:18.875 --> 12:21.000
Actually, sir, that may

12:18.875 --> 12:21.000
be an incorrect analogy.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.166
How so, Data?

12:22.166 --> 12:23.792
A hiccup

12:22.166 --> 12:23.792
is a spasmodic inhalation

12:23.792 --> 12:25.208
with closure of the glottis

12:25.208 --> 12:27.166
accompanied by

12:25.208 --> 12:27.166
a peculiar sound.

12:27.166 --> 12:30.208
If we were to continue this

12:27.166 --> 12:30.208
analogy to a body-function

12:30.208 --> 12:31.583
what occurred would be

12:30.208 --> 12:31.583
best represented by a...

12:31.583 --> 12:33.417
Enough, Data.

12:33.417 --> 12:35.125
Have you been able to learn

12:33.417 --> 12:35.125
any more specifics

12:35.125 --> 12:36.834
about the Manheim

12:35.125 --> 12:36.834
project?

12:36.834 --> 12:38.250
All I have found, sir,

12:36.834 --> 12:38.250
is what you already know.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.625
Manheim was concentrating

12:39.625 --> 12:41.500
on time gravity experiments

12:39.625 --> 12:41.500
when he left.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.917
LA FORGE:

12:41.500 --> 12:42.917
Captain.

12:42.917 --> 12:45.542
We've reached the coordinates

12:42.917 --> 12:45.542
specified.

12:45.542 --> 12:46.875
There's nothing here.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.750
I'm receiving

12:46.875 --> 12:48.750
new coordinates.

12:48.750 --> 12:52.125
It's a relay signal, same

12:48.750 --> 12:52.125
source as the first one.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.208
What are

12:52.125 --> 12:53.208
they, Worf?

12:54.792 --> 13:00.166
664.8 by 1323.7 by 4949.9.

13:00.166 --> 13:02.000
Very remote area, sir.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.083
It's in the middle

13:02.000 --> 13:04.083
of the Vandor System

13:04.083 --> 13:05.458
a binary star system.

13:05.458 --> 13:07.375
Main star is a B-class giant.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.208
The companion star

13:07.375 --> 13:09.208
is a pulsar.

13:09.208 --> 13:11.333
Set course for the new

13:09.208 --> 13:11.333
coordinates, Mr. La Forge.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.583
Aye, sir.

13:13.583 --> 13:17.250
Why is he making it this

13:13.583 --> 13:17.250
difficult to find him?

13:17.250 --> 13:19.500
Hopefully, he'll

13:17.250 --> 13:19.500
tell us, Number One.

13:26.417 --> 13:29.250
We have reached the

13:26.417 --> 13:29.250
coordinates, Captain.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.625
Sensors indicate

13:29.250 --> 13:31.625
it is Vandor IV--

13:31.625 --> 13:33.125
a planetoid

13:31.625 --> 13:33.125
in elliptical orbit

13:33.125 --> 13:34.500
around the

13:33.125 --> 13:34.500
binary system.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.333
Standard orbit, Mr. La Forge.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.291
Aye, sir.

13:37.291 --> 13:38.542
Give me a visual.

13:38.542 --> 13:40.583
Viewscreen on.

13:40.583 --> 13:43.792
WORF:

13:40.583 --> 13:43.792
There's a small

13:40.583 --> 13:43.792
force field on the planet.

13:43.792 --> 13:46.709
Latitude 20 degrees,

13:43.792 --> 13:46.709
nine minutes north.

13:46.709 --> 13:49.208
Longitude 40 degrees,

13:46.709 --> 13:49.208
two minutes east

13:49.208 --> 13:50.542
of the present terminator.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.208
Penetrable?

13:52.208 --> 13:53.500
No, sir.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.792
Open hailing frequencies.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.458
Hailing frequencies

13:54.792 --> 13:57.458
open, sir.

13:57.458 --> 13:58.917
This is Captain...

13:58.917 --> 14:01.417
This is the Captain

13:58.917 --> 14:01.417
of the USS<i> Enterprise</i>

14:01.417 --> 14:03.834
responding to your

14:01.417 --> 14:03.834
call for help.

14:03.834 --> 14:07.000
WOMAN:

14:03.834 --> 14:07.000
<i>Enterprise.</i>

14:03.834 --> 14:07.000
Thank you for hearing us.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.542
Where are you?

14:08.542 --> 14:11.041
We're in orbit

14:08.542 --> 14:11.041
around Vandor, now.

14:11.041 --> 14:14.083
Then you can help me.

14:11.041 --> 14:14.083
I-I don't know what to do.

14:14.083 --> 14:18.250
It's only the two of us left.

14:14.083 --> 14:18.250
He's having convulsions.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.458
Please.

14:20.458 --> 14:23.667
Can you lock on

14:20.458 --> 14:23.667
to her coordinates?

14:23.667 --> 14:25.959
No, sir. The force field is

14:23.667 --> 14:25.959
preventing any kind of contact

14:25.959 --> 14:27.542
other than audio.

14:27.542 --> 14:29.625
There is a force field

14:27.542 --> 14:29.625
at your location.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.333
Yes, I know.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.667
Good.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.875
But it is preventing us

14:32.667 --> 14:34.875
from helping you.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.917
Now, you must try to find

14:34.875 --> 14:37.917
some way to shut it down.

14:37.917 --> 14:40.291
I'll try.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.792
Force field is off.

14:45.792 --> 14:48.000
Good.

14:45.792 --> 14:48.000
Lock on to their coordinates.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.458
Beam them up

14:48.000 --> 14:49.458
directly to Sick Bay.

14:49.458 --> 14:51.625
Dr. Crusher, prepare

14:49.458 --> 14:51.625
for a medical emergency.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.333
Two to beam directly

14:51.625 --> 14:53.333
up to Sick Bay.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.834
CRUSHER:

14:53.333 --> 14:55.834
We'll be ready, Captain.

14:55.834 --> 14:57.083
That's where I'll be.

15:00.709 --> 15:02.125
Number One.

15:00.709 --> 15:02.125
Mr. Data.

15:15.917 --> 15:19.917
I'll help.

15:19.917 --> 15:22.333
Easy. Easy.

15:22.333 --> 15:23.875
I've got his legs.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.500
How long has he been like this?

15:29.500 --> 15:31.667
Several hours,

15:29.500 --> 15:31.667
at least.

15:31.667 --> 15:34.709
He was in his lab,

15:31.667 --> 15:34.709
so I can't be sure.

15:34.709 --> 15:37.667
I need to do some tests.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.750
I... uh...

15:51.333 --> 15:54.417
Jean-Luc.

15:54.417 --> 15:58.208
I thought the voice

15:54.417 --> 15:58.208
sounded familiar.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.750
Hello.

16:03.709 --> 16:06.583
I should have known.

16:06.583 --> 16:09.500
Who else would have

16:06.583 --> 16:09.500
charged to my rescue?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.583
This is my First Officer,

16:16.000 --> 16:19.583
Commander William Riker.

16:19.583 --> 16:22.917
Lieutenant Commander Data.

16:22.917 --> 16:26.542
This is Jenice...

16:22.917 --> 16:26.542
Manheim.

16:26.542 --> 16:28.166
A pleasure, Mrs. Manheim.

16:28.166 --> 16:31.250
Thank you.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.333
I have a number

16:31.250 --> 16:33.333
of questions for you.

16:33.333 --> 16:36.667
I hope I can be

16:33.333 --> 16:36.667
of some help.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.500
Why don't we sit down in here?

16:40.417 --> 16:41.834
You said that there were

16:40.417 --> 16:41.834
only two of you left.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.125
What happened

16:41.834 --> 16:44.125
to the rest of the crew?

16:44.125 --> 16:46.417
They were working

16:44.125 --> 16:46.417
at the second lab.

16:46.417 --> 16:48.583
Something happened there

16:46.417 --> 16:48.583
a few weeks ago.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.667
They were all killed.

16:51.667 --> 16:52.875
It was a terrible accident.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.000
I don't know

16:52.875 --> 16:55.000
exactly what happened.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.709
So many brilliant,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.709
wonderful minds...

16:57.709 --> 16:59.834
just gone.

16:59.834 --> 17:03.458
Do you know the nature

16:59.834 --> 17:03.458
of Dr. Manheim's work?

17:03.458 --> 17:05.542
Paul's always been

17:03.458 --> 17:05.542
interested in time.

17:05.542 --> 17:07.875
He's never believed

17:05.542 --> 17:07.875
that it was immutable

17:07.875 --> 17:10.875
any more than space

17:07.875 --> 17:10.875
is immutable.

17:10.875 --> 17:13.083
Over the last decade,

17:10.875 --> 17:13.083
he came to believe

17:13.083 --> 17:16.250
that we reside in one

17:13.083 --> 17:16.250
of infinite dimensions

17:16.250 --> 17:17.542
and what holds

17:16.250 --> 17:17.542
us here

17:17.542 --> 17:19.291
is the constancy

17:17.542 --> 17:19.291
of time.

17:19.291 --> 17:21.709
Change that and it would be

17:19.291 --> 17:21.709
what he called

17:21.709 --> 17:24.709
opening the window

17:21.709 --> 17:24.709
to those other dimensions.

17:24.709 --> 17:27.542
Which begins

17:24.709 --> 17:27.542
to explain what happened.

17:27.542 --> 17:29.959
Have you been experiencing

17:29.959 --> 17:30.959
something up here?

17:30.959 --> 17:33.208
Yes, what is emanating here

17:33.208 --> 17:35.291
is having repercussions

17:33.208 --> 17:35.291
light years away

17:35.291 --> 17:36.875
maybe even further.

17:36.875 --> 17:39.625
That would explain his anxiety.

17:39.625 --> 17:42.917
I had no idea it had gone

17:39.625 --> 17:42.917
so far beyond Vandor.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.959
Why this place?

17:42.917 --> 17:44.959
Why Vandor?

17:44.959 --> 17:46.250
All I can tell you about that

17:46.250 --> 17:48.250
is that Paul

17:46.250 --> 17:48.250
and the rest of the team

17:48.250 --> 17:50.041
searched for two years

17:48.250 --> 17:50.041
to find it.

17:50.041 --> 17:52.625
Vandor is exactly

17:50.041 --> 17:52.625
what they needed--

17:52.625 --> 17:54.709
a planetoid

17:52.625 --> 17:54.709
around a binary star.

17:54.709 --> 17:57.250
Because of the dense

17:54.709 --> 17:57.250
gravity of the pulsar.

17:57.250 --> 18:00.625
Did your husband ever attempt

17:57.250 --> 18:00.625
to define these dimensions

18:00.625 --> 18:01.834
to give you an idea

18:01.834 --> 18:03.166
of what

18:01.834 --> 18:03.166
he expected?

18:03.166 --> 18:06.834
No, but he did say

18:03.166 --> 18:06.834
that he was very close

18:06.834 --> 18:09.291
to proving his theories.

18:09.291 --> 18:11.000
And then the accident...

18:11.000 --> 18:14.750
Did he anticipate that these

18:11.000 --> 18:14.750
experiments might be dangerous?

18:14.750 --> 18:16.792
I didn't think so

18:16.792 --> 18:21.291
but, now in retrospect,

18:16.792 --> 18:21.291
he probably did.

18:21.291 --> 18:24.333
That would explain

18:21.291 --> 18:24.333
the unusual precautions

18:24.333 --> 18:28.250
he began taking

18:24.333 --> 18:28.250
even before the accident--

18:28.250 --> 18:30.667
the force field

18:30.667 --> 18:32.750
the elaborate

18:30.667 --> 18:32.750
security system.

18:32.750 --> 18:35.208
And every time he started

18:32.750 --> 18:35.208
a new experiment

18:35.208 --> 18:37.000
he insisted that I stay

18:35.208 --> 18:37.000
in what he called

18:37.000 --> 18:39.083
a protected room.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.959
Aha, and that's why you

18:39.083 --> 18:40.959
weren't affected.

18:40.959 --> 18:44.500
Jean-Luc, he would never

18:40.959 --> 18:44.500
knowingly do anything

18:44.500 --> 18:45.583
to hurt anyone.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.583
Yes, I believe that.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.375
But as he saw his goal

18:47.583 --> 18:49.375
getting closer--

18:49.375 --> 18:51.709
seeming possible--

18:51.709 --> 18:53.750
he became more

18:51.709 --> 18:53.750
and more obsessive.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.750
Maybe that clouded

18:53.750 --> 18:56.750
his judgment.

19:02.583 --> 19:05.959
This is not how I imagined

19:02.583 --> 19:05.959
seeing you again.

19:05.959 --> 19:08.125
Nor I you.

19:08.125 --> 19:09.959
You've

19:08.125 --> 19:09.959
done well.

19:09.959 --> 19:11.792
A great starship

19:11.792 --> 19:14.000
on the far reaches

19:11.792 --> 19:14.000
of the galaxy.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.333
It's everything you'd hoped.

19:16.333 --> 19:17.625
(<i> chuckling</i> )

19:17.625 --> 19:18.792
Not exactly.

19:18.792 --> 19:22.792
Nothing works

19:18.792 --> 19:22.792
just as you hope.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.709
If you can't tell us

19:22.792 --> 19:24.709
any more

19:24.709 --> 19:27.458
I need to send

19:24.709 --> 19:27.458
a team down to the lab.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.375
You can't--

19:27.458 --> 19:29.375
it's protected.

19:29.375 --> 19:31.458
One of the young

19:29.375 --> 19:31.458
scientists

19:31.458 --> 19:33.750
made sure no one

19:31.458 --> 19:33.750
could get in.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.125
CRUSHER:

19:33.750 --> 19:35.125
Uh, excuse me.

19:36.875 --> 19:37.875
Is he worse?

19:37.875 --> 19:38.875
He's resting.

19:38.875 --> 19:39.875
But I'd like you

19:39.875 --> 19:41.500
to undergo

19:39.875 --> 19:41.500
some tests yourself.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.709
My nurse will

19:41.500 --> 19:43.709
start them.

19:43.709 --> 19:46.792
Thank you

19:43.709 --> 19:46.792
for your kindness, Doctor.

19:54.417 --> 19:56.291
She's an old friend.

19:56.291 --> 19:57.834
I gathered that.

19:57.834 --> 19:59.875
It's her husband I'm more

19:57.834 --> 19:59.875
concerned with at the moment.

19:59.875 --> 20:01.291
What's the prognosis?

20:01.291 --> 20:03.166
I believe

20:01.291 --> 20:03.166
he's dying.

20:03.166 --> 20:04.750
His neurochemistry

20:03.166 --> 20:04.750
has been affected

20:04.750 --> 20:06.083
but I don't know how or why.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.792
I've never encountered

20:06.083 --> 20:07.792
anything like it before.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.000
How long does he have?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.417
Maybe a couple

20:09.000 --> 20:10.417
of days.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.458
It's hard to predict.

20:11.458 --> 20:13.041
All I can do

20:11.458 --> 20:13.041
is maintain him--

20:13.041 --> 20:14.333
or attempt

20:13.041 --> 20:14.333
to maintain him--

20:14.333 --> 20:15.792
until I find out

20:14.333 --> 20:15.792
what's causing the damage.

20:15.792 --> 20:17.000
Can we talk

20:15.792 --> 20:17.000
to him?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Not now,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
not yet.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.417
Incidentally, Captain

20:24.417 --> 20:26.208
the effects

20:24.417 --> 20:26.208
of the time distortions

20:26.208 --> 20:28.542
are now being felt

20:26.208 --> 20:28.542
in the Ilecom System.

20:33.208 --> 20:34.208
Bridge.

20:34.208 --> 20:35.333
(<i> beeping</i> )

20:35.333 --> 20:36.917
In the past decade

20:36.917 --> 20:38.750
Manheim has turned

20:36.917 --> 20:38.750
some vague theories

20:38.750 --> 20:40.417
into a practical

20:38.750 --> 20:40.417
application.

20:40.417 --> 20:41.875
Yes, but without his help

20:41.875 --> 20:43.208
I'm not sure we'll be able

20:43.208 --> 20:45.458
to pose any

20:43.208 --> 20:45.458
intelligent questions

20:45.458 --> 20:47.667
let alone come up

20:45.458 --> 20:47.667
with any solutions.

20:47.667 --> 20:48.834
Incidentally, Captain

20:48.834 --> 20:50.750
the effects

20:48.834 --> 20:50.750
of the time distortions

20:50.750 --> 20:53.125
are now being felt

20:50.750 --> 20:53.125
in the Ilecom System.

20:53.125 --> 20:56.125
It's us, before we stepped

20:53.125 --> 20:56.125
into the turbolift.

20:56.125 --> 20:58.083
It's happening again.

20:58.083 --> 21:00.667
I feel no disorientation.

21:00.667 --> 21:01.959
Nor do I.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.583
What was that?

21:05.583 --> 21:07.250
I believe what

21:05.583 --> 21:07.250
could be termed as

21:07.250 --> 21:08.291
the Manheim effect

21:08.291 --> 21:09.625
is becoming

21:08.291 --> 21:09.625
more pronounced.

21:09.625 --> 21:12.250
This is where

21:09.625 --> 21:12.250
we started.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.500
If we are us.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.750
Oh, we are us, sir

21:14.750 --> 21:16.500
but they

21:14.750 --> 21:16.500
are also us

21:16.500 --> 21:19.250
so, indeed,

21:16.500 --> 21:19.250
we are both us...

21:19.250 --> 21:22.041
at different points

21:19.250 --> 21:22.041
along the same time continuum.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.917
Bridge.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.208
(<i> beeping</i> )

21:40.625 --> 21:42.583
What have

21:40.625 --> 21:42.583
you learned?

21:42.583 --> 21:45.083
We have completed a scan

21:42.583 --> 21:45.083
of the planet's surface, sir.

21:45.083 --> 21:46.291
We've discovered

21:45.083 --> 21:46.291
the second lab.

21:46.291 --> 21:47.417
It's on the far side

21:46.291 --> 21:47.417
of the planet--

21:47.417 --> 21:48.542
completely destroyed.

21:48.542 --> 21:51.291
Unable to determine

21:48.542 --> 21:51.291
what caused it.

21:51.291 --> 21:53.542
Otherwise, very little

21:51.291 --> 21:53.542
to clarify this situation.

21:53.542 --> 21:55.625
Our sensors show

21:53.542 --> 21:55.625
an immense volume of energy

21:55.625 --> 21:57.291
emanating deep

21:55.625 --> 21:57.291
within the planet

21:57.291 --> 21:59.583
and concentrated near

21:57.291 --> 21:59.583
Manheim's remaining laboratory.

21:59.583 --> 22:00.709
How is the energy being used?

22:00.709 --> 22:02.000
No idea.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.041
What's its

22:02.000 --> 22:03.041
source?

22:03.041 --> 22:04.542
I cannot be sure, sir

22:04.542 --> 22:06.166
but I believe Manheim

22:04.542 --> 22:06.166
has developed a method

22:06.166 --> 22:08.083
for harnessing energy

22:06.166 --> 22:08.083
from the pulsar.

22:08.083 --> 22:09.875
RIKER:

22:08.083 --> 22:09.875
It comes down

22:08.083 --> 22:09.875
to this, Captain--

22:09.875 --> 22:11.375
we've learned everything

22:09.875 --> 22:11.375
we can from here

22:11.375 --> 22:13.291
and we are no closer

22:11.375 --> 22:13.291
to understanding it

22:13.291 --> 22:14.959
than we were 12 hours ago.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.583
Manheim is unable to help us

22:16.583 --> 22:19.792
but, hopefully, having been a

22:16.583 --> 22:19.792
good scientist, he kept notes.

22:19.792 --> 22:21.667
I would need to study

22:19.792 --> 22:21.667
Manheim's records, sir.

22:21.667 --> 22:22.834
In order to do that

22:22.834 --> 22:24.417
we're going to have

22:22.834 --> 22:24.417
to go down there.

22:24.417 --> 22:26.458
What about the defense system

22:24.417 --> 22:26.458
Mrs. Manheim spoke of?

22:26.458 --> 22:28.291
It may have been connected

22:26.458 --> 22:28.291
to the main system

22:28.291 --> 22:29.750
and when she lowered

22:28.291 --> 22:29.750
the shields

22:29.750 --> 22:31.250
she may have turned

22:29.750 --> 22:31.250
that off, as well.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.917
If not, we'll deal with it

22:31.250 --> 22:32.917
as best we can.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.000
Prepare your team.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.125
Aye, sir.

22:42.375 --> 22:43.667
Coordinates set?

22:43.667 --> 22:45.750
Yes, sir.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.375
Energize.

23:01.291 --> 23:03.500
There's a lack of integrity

23:01.291 --> 23:03.500
at the landing point.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.500
I'm losing them.

23:05.500 --> 23:08.542
Bring them back-- now!

23:16.291 --> 23:17.959
Chief Herbert,

23:16.291 --> 23:17.959
what's going on?

23:17.959 --> 23:21.792
There seems to be some kind

23:17.959 --> 23:21.792
of strange bouncing effect.

23:21.792 --> 23:24.625
I can't get them to materialize.

23:24.625 --> 23:27.000
My readings aren't complete.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.500
Keep trying.

23:44.750 --> 23:46.125
What are we

23:44.750 --> 23:46.125
doing back here?

23:46.125 --> 23:48.834
You're lucky you made it back

23:46.125 --> 23:48.834
at all, sir.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.500
Where am I?

23:57.500 --> 23:58.750
Paul?

24:02.166 --> 24:03.208
Thank God.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.750
You're on the

24:03.208 --> 24:05.750
USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

24:05.750 --> 24:08.125
They answered

24:05.750 --> 24:08.125
your distress signal.

24:08.125 --> 24:09.750
I sent one?

24:09.750 --> 24:12.458
Oh Paul, you're going to be

24:09.750 --> 24:12.458
just fine.

24:12.458 --> 24:15.166
No, I am not fine, Jenice.

24:15.166 --> 24:16.875
I'm not even close to fine.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.458
Bridge, this is Dr. Crusher.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.583
Professor Manheim is conscious.

24:20.583 --> 24:21.917
MANHEIM:

24:20.583 --> 24:21.917
Remember, it was worth it.

24:21.917 --> 24:23.834
What happened, what

24:21.917 --> 24:23.834
will happen, all of it.

24:23.834 --> 24:26.500
It was all worth it.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.166
Again.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.417
It's changing again.

24:29.417 --> 24:30.500
What is?

24:30.500 --> 24:31.917
What do you see?

24:31.917 --> 24:33.583
I am having difficulty.

24:33.583 --> 24:35.375
With what?

24:33.583 --> 24:35.375
Are you in pain?

24:35.375 --> 24:37.917
I have been on the other side.

24:37.917 --> 24:40.834
I have touched

24:37.917 --> 24:40.834
another dimension.

24:40.834 --> 24:43.959
Part of me

24:40.834 --> 24:43.959
is still there.

24:43.959 --> 24:45.542
Help him.

24:45.542 --> 24:47.583
Try to stay calm, Dr. Manheim.

24:47.583 --> 24:49.917
I don't think it's going to help

24:47.583 --> 24:49.917
you, struggling against it.

24:49.917 --> 24:53.000
My mind is floating

24:49.917 --> 24:53.000
between two places.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.250
It is difficult to know

24:53.000 --> 24:56.250
which is which.

24:56.250 --> 24:58.834
There is no way

24:56.250 --> 24:58.834
to explain it.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.875
Dr. Manheim,

25:00.875 --> 25:03.875
I'm Captain Picard.

25:05.709 --> 25:07.000
The same one?

25:10.583 --> 25:12.625
She has told me about you.

25:12.625 --> 25:15.166
Not all, but enough.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.500
We need your help.

25:16.500 --> 25:18.375
The situation is not good.

25:18.375 --> 25:19.959
It will get worse.

25:19.959 --> 25:22.041
What do we do?

25:19.959 --> 25:22.041
How do we stop it?

25:22.041 --> 25:25.709
I am having difficulty

25:22.041 --> 25:25.709
holding the moment.

25:25.709 --> 25:28.208
Doctor, this is Lieutenant

25:25.709 --> 25:28.208
Commander Data.

25:28.208 --> 25:31.250
Will you explain

25:28.208 --> 25:31.250
the situation to him?

25:31.250 --> 25:33.291
I am fully versed, sir,

25:31.250 --> 25:33.291
on all your theories

25:33.291 --> 25:34.625
regarding time and gravity.

25:34.625 --> 25:36.375
How is that possible?

25:36.375 --> 25:40.458
I am not even fully versed

25:36.375 --> 25:40.458
on all my theories.

25:40.458 --> 25:41.959
I am an android.

25:41.959 --> 25:46.458
Android?

25:41.959 --> 25:46.458
On a Starfleet vessel?

25:46.458 --> 25:48.041
I am the only one, sir.

25:48.041 --> 25:50.583
Your knowledge

25:48.041 --> 25:50.583
is useless

25:50.583 --> 25:52.000
because the work

25:50.583 --> 25:52.000
we have done here

25:52.000 --> 25:54.166
has made most

25:52.000 --> 25:54.166
of those theories obsolete.

25:54.166 --> 25:57.458
Then you have harnessed

25:54.166 --> 25:57.458
a dynamic energy source.

25:57.458 --> 25:59.792
Then you do

25:57.458 --> 25:59.792
understand, yes.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.166
We were able to locate

25:59.792 --> 26:02.166
an energy source

26:02.166 --> 26:04.208
in the center of this planetoid.

26:04.208 --> 26:08.166
We learned to enhance it,

26:04.208 --> 26:08.166
to focus it.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.750
Everything worked too well.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.250
The energy from the pulsar.

26:13.250 --> 26:15.500
The energy from the planetoid.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.792
We opened a crack...

26:17.792 --> 26:21.083
a window into another dimension.

26:21.083 --> 26:23.000
The time distortion we felt.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.834
Felt?

26:24.834 --> 26:27.417
Then it is not confined

26:24.834 --> 26:27.417
to the planetoid?

26:27.417 --> 26:28.583
The range is at least

26:28.583 --> 26:31.125
several thousand

26:28.583 --> 26:31.125
light years.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.125
Captain, it must be stopped.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.041
You must help me to execute

26:35.041 --> 26:38.041
a controlled shut-down

26:35.041 --> 26:38.041
of this experiment.

26:38.041 --> 26:39.041
Get my notes.

26:39.041 --> 26:40.333
They are in the lab.

26:40.333 --> 26:43.792
How do we bypass

26:40.333 --> 26:43.792
the security system?

26:43.792 --> 26:45.458
I'll give you

26:43.792 --> 26:45.458
the correct coordinates

26:45.458 --> 26:47.250
to beam safely down to Vandor

26:47.250 --> 26:49.875
and the codes you need

26:47.250 --> 26:49.875
to bypass security systems

26:49.875 --> 26:52.875
to get into my lab.

26:52.875 --> 26:54.834
(<i> gasps</i> )

27:01.834 --> 27:03.792
If what the professor

27:01.834 --> 27:03.792
has given me is accurate

27:03.792 --> 27:06.041
it is possible

27:03.792 --> 27:06.041
to repair the damage

27:06.041 --> 27:09.083
but it must be perfectly

27:06.041 --> 27:09.083
timed to coincide

27:09.083 --> 27:10.792
with another time

27:09.083 --> 27:10.792
distortion episode.

27:10.792 --> 27:12.166
Can we predict the timing?

27:12.166 --> 27:13.166
I believe so, sir.

27:13.166 --> 27:14.875
We have to.

27:14.875 --> 27:16.583
If we don't seal that hole,

27:14.875 --> 27:16.583
this other dimension he's opened

27:16.583 --> 27:18.500
will rip into the fabric

27:16.583 --> 27:18.500
of the galaxy.

27:18.500 --> 27:21.458
Reality as we perceive it

27:18.500 --> 27:21.458
will not be the same.

27:21.458 --> 27:23.583
Lieutenant Worf.

27:21.458 --> 27:23.583
Yes, sir?

27:23.583 --> 27:26.041
I want those codes that

27:23.583 --> 27:26.041
Manheim gave Mr. Data rechecked

27:26.041 --> 27:27.750
and then checked again.

27:27.750 --> 27:30.333
No one is beaming down to Vandor

27:27.750 --> 27:30.333
unless we can be reasonably sure

27:30.333 --> 27:31.458
they can get through.

27:31.458 --> 27:33.375
Aye, sir.

27:33.375 --> 27:35.625
I'm sorry for intruding.

27:35.625 --> 27:37.709
I was told

27:35.625 --> 27:37.709
I'd find you here.

27:37.709 --> 27:39.166
You're not intruding.

27:39.166 --> 27:40.792
We're just finished.

27:39.166 --> 27:40.792
Come in.

27:40.792 --> 27:41.834
Thank you.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.709
I knew you wouldn't come to me.

27:53.709 --> 27:57.166
No, not

27:53.709 --> 27:57.166
under these circumstances.

27:59.500 --> 28:02.625
We have unfinished business.

28:02.625 --> 28:05.834
Yes, we do.

28:05.834 --> 28:08.375
Why didn't you come to meet me

28:05.834 --> 28:08.375
that last day in Paris?

28:11.792 --> 28:13.291
I was afraid.

28:13.291 --> 28:14.625
I didn't want this.

28:14.625 --> 28:15.583
What?

28:15.583 --> 28:16.834
The truth.

28:16.834 --> 28:18.625
Oh, you want me to lie?

28:18.625 --> 28:20.959
Of course.

28:20.959 --> 28:24.834
A nice, soft, painless lie.

28:24.834 --> 28:26.333
Oh, I got the days confused.

28:26.333 --> 28:28.542
I thought it was Tuesday

28:26.333 --> 28:28.542
when it was Wednesday.

28:28.542 --> 28:29.750
I went to the Cafe Moulin

28:29.750 --> 28:31.792
instead

28:29.750 --> 28:31.792
of the Cafe des Artistes.

28:31.792 --> 28:33.917
Ah, that's better.

28:33.917 --> 28:36.667
It was raining

28:33.917 --> 28:36.667
and you couldn't find a cab.

28:36.667 --> 28:38.500
Mm-hmm.

28:41.917 --> 28:44.834
I waited all day.

28:44.834 --> 28:47.041
And it was raining.

28:47.041 --> 28:48.458
It rained the rest of the week.

28:48.458 --> 28:50.583
I went to Starfleet

28:48.458 --> 28:50.583
Headquarters

28:50.583 --> 28:51.709
looking for you

28:51.709 --> 28:54.834
but you'd already

28:51.709 --> 28:54.834
shipped out.

28:54.834 --> 28:59.250
So, come on, Jean-Luc.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.875
Let's hear the truth.

29:03.875 --> 29:08.583
It was fear.

29:08.583 --> 29:11.083
Fear of seeing you,

29:08.583 --> 29:11.083
losing my resolve.

29:11.083 --> 29:14.667
Fear of staying.

29:14.667 --> 29:17.417
Losing myself.

29:17.417 --> 29:19.750
Fear that neither

29:17.417 --> 29:19.750
of these choices was right

29:19.750 --> 29:23.458
and that either would have...

29:26.125 --> 29:29.834
For a long time,

29:26.125 --> 29:29.834
not a day went by

29:29.834 --> 29:33.125
that I didn't look up

29:29.834 --> 29:33.125
into the sky

29:33.125 --> 29:34.959
and wonder.

29:40.709 --> 29:42.667
Each time that I

29:40.709 --> 29:42.667
returned to Earth

29:42.667 --> 29:45.125
my thoughts were

29:42.667 --> 29:45.125
filled with you.

29:45.125 --> 29:49.500
I've thought a lot about this

29:45.125 --> 29:49.500
over the years.

29:49.500 --> 29:52.625
And perhaps you're leaving out

29:49.500 --> 29:52.625
your greatest fear.

29:52.625 --> 29:56.750
The real reason

29:52.625 --> 29:56.750
you left.

29:56.750 --> 29:58.041
Which was?

29:58.041 --> 30:00.667
That life

29:58.041 --> 30:00.667
with me

30:00.667 --> 30:04.625
would have somehow made you

30:00.667 --> 30:04.625
ordinary.

30:14.458 --> 30:17.166
(<i> chuckling</i> )

30:19.667 --> 30:21.500
You're wonderful.

30:21.500 --> 30:25.959
And am I that transparent?

30:25.959 --> 30:27.709
Only to me.

30:51.875 --> 30:55.875
I wish I could talk to you,

30:51.875 --> 30:55.875
Professor Manheim.

30:55.875 --> 30:58.667
I bet you were really something.

31:00.417 --> 31:02.834
(<i> moaning</i> )

31:08.125 --> 31:09.750
Deanna.

31:09.750 --> 31:12.959
I wanted to see

31:09.750 --> 31:12.959
how he was doing.

31:12.959 --> 31:16.083
The same.

31:16.083 --> 31:19.709
Nothing I do seems

31:16.083 --> 31:19.709
to make any difference.

31:22.709 --> 31:25.709
That's not why you're here.

31:25.709 --> 31:30.834
I thought I was

31:25.709 --> 31:30.834
the empath.

31:36.417 --> 31:37.542
Are you all right?

31:37.542 --> 31:39.125
Why wouldn't I be?

31:39.125 --> 31:41.291
I've got one of the medical

31:39.125 --> 31:41.291
wonders of the galaxy

31:41.291 --> 31:43.750
dying in my Sick Bay.

31:43.750 --> 31:46.166
That's not what

31:43.750 --> 31:46.166
I meant.

31:46.166 --> 31:47.709
I don't think

31:46.166 --> 31:47.709
I want to talk

31:47.709 --> 31:49.917
about what I think

31:47.709 --> 31:49.917
you mean.

31:49.917 --> 31:51.250
Captain Picard...

31:51.250 --> 31:54.083
I can't compete with a ghost

31:51.250 --> 31:54.083
from his past.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.291
No one could.

31:55.291 --> 31:57.917
She's not a ghost.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.500
She's here right now.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.500
She may be in the here and now

32:01.500 --> 32:04.500
but it's the ghost he sees.

32:04.500 --> 32:05.583
Excuse me.

32:05.583 --> 32:08.917
I have to get back

32:05.583 --> 32:08.917
to my patient.

32:13.250 --> 32:14.875
How soon, Mr. Data?

32:14.875 --> 32:17.667
If Dr. Manheim's

32:14.875 --> 32:17.667
information is correct

32:17.667 --> 32:18.792
by my calculations

32:18.792 --> 32:21.417
the next time distortion

32:18.792 --> 32:21.417
should occur

32:21.417 --> 32:23.000
between 28

32:21.417 --> 32:23.000
to 47 minutes.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.041
CRUSHER:

32:23.000 --> 32:25.041
Bridge, this is Sick Bay.

32:25.041 --> 32:28.250
Dr. Manheim is awake and asking

32:25.041 --> 32:28.250
to speak to you, Captain.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.667
Alone.

32:29.667 --> 32:31.375
On my way, Doctor.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.959
You asked for me.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.625
I am not sure

32:43.625 --> 32:47.542
that I remembered all of the

32:43.625 --> 32:47.542
codes for the security system.

32:47.542 --> 32:49.500
You should warn

32:47.542 --> 32:49.500
anyone going down there.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.208
Thank you.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.208
I'll tell them to be cautious.

32:52.208 --> 32:58.000
What I really wanted to talk

32:52.208 --> 32:58.000
to you about is Jenice.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.625
Dr. Manheim, I did not come here

32:58.000 --> 33:01.625
to discuss your wife.

33:01.625 --> 33:03.375
It is only this.

33:04.917 --> 33:07.041
If anything

33:04.917 --> 33:07.041
should go wrong

33:07.041 --> 33:11.250
please take care of her for me.

33:19.542 --> 33:21.208
Of course.

33:23.709 --> 33:28.250
She never would admit this

33:28.250 --> 33:30.542
but she has had a terrible time

33:28.250 --> 33:30.542
these last years.

33:30.542 --> 33:33.208
Had we not been

33:30.542 --> 33:33.208
so isolated

33:33.208 --> 33:34.542
she might have

33:33.208 --> 33:34.542
left me

33:34.542 --> 33:36.125
and I never would have known.

33:36.125 --> 33:38.458
At least, not right away.

33:38.458 --> 33:40.792
Perhaps I am

33:38.458 --> 33:40.792
not a man

33:40.792 --> 33:44.792
who should have

33:40.792 --> 33:44.792
a woman like her.

33:44.792 --> 33:46.750
She deserves better.

33:49.792 --> 33:52.500
You underestimate her.

33:52.500 --> 33:56.083
I know, because

33:52.500 --> 33:56.083
I once did.

34:02.709 --> 34:05.500
In both cases,

34:02.709 --> 34:05.500
the time distortions occurred

34:05.500 --> 34:07.583
along the same continuum

34:07.583 --> 34:11.083
as a preview or a reprise

34:07.583 --> 34:11.083
of a specific point in time.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.917
Where we are,

34:11.083 --> 34:12.917
where we were

34:12.917 --> 34:14.583
and where we will be.

34:14.583 --> 34:19.291
Data, I want this to be

34:14.583 --> 34:19.291
an away team of one-- you.

34:19.291 --> 34:22.291
I don't think there's any reason

34:19.291 --> 34:22.291
to risk anyone else.

34:22.291 --> 34:24.041
It is reasonable, sir.

34:24.041 --> 34:27.583
After all, I

34:24.041 --> 34:27.583
am a machine,

34:24.041 --> 34:27.583
and dispensable.

34:27.583 --> 34:30.417
"Indispensable" is

34:27.583 --> 34:30.417
the appropriate word.

34:30.417 --> 34:32.250
I think it should be

34:30.417 --> 34:32.250
only you

34:32.250 --> 34:34.417
because you seem

34:32.250 --> 34:34.417
more able to control

34:34.417 --> 34:36.583
the effects

34:34.417 --> 34:36.583
of the time distortion.

34:36.583 --> 34:39.875
Oh, I see, sir.

34:36.583 --> 34:39.875
That is quite true, sir.

34:39.875 --> 34:41.208
I see time

34:39.875 --> 34:41.208
as a constant

34:41.208 --> 34:43.583
whereas humans perceive

34:41.208 --> 34:43.583
time as flexible.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.166
Hence the expression

34:45.166 --> 34:47.792
"time flies when

34:45.166 --> 34:47.792
you're having fun"

34:47.792 --> 34:50.125
which, until now, has

34:47.792 --> 34:50.125
always confused me.

34:50.125 --> 34:54.709
Well, I want you

34:50.125 --> 34:54.709
to put a stitch in time

34:54.709 --> 34:57.375
and save

34:54.709 --> 34:57.375
much more than nine.

34:57.375 --> 34:58.417
Sir?

34:58.417 --> 35:00.667
If other members

34:58.417 --> 35:00.667
of the away team

35:00.667 --> 35:02.959
became disoriented

35:02.959 --> 35:05.750
it could create

35:02.959 --> 35:05.750
additional problems

35:05.750 --> 35:07.583
and perhaps increase the danger.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.792
I will go immediately, sir.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.041
Good luck, Data.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.125
All right.

35:18.125 --> 35:21.500
We have the coordinates exactly

35:18.125 --> 35:21.500
as the professor specified.

35:47.125 --> 35:49.834
Maintain an open frequency,

35:47.125 --> 35:49.834
Mr. Data.

35:49.834 --> 35:51.250

36:02.500 --> 36:04.750

36:14.792 --> 36:17.208
Mr. Data, what's going on?

36:17.208 --> 36:19.041
Dr. Manheim forgot to mention

36:19.041 --> 36:22.083
one of his security

36:19.041 --> 36:22.083
precautions, sir.

36:22.083 --> 36:24.583
I am proceeding

36:22.083 --> 36:24.583
into the laboratory.

(<i> chiming roar</i> )

36:56.125 --> 36:58.959
PICARD:

36:56.125 --> 36:58.959
Mr. Data, this channel

36:56.125 --> 36:58.959
will remain open.

36:58.959 --> 37:00.750
Please continue to report.

37:04.959 --> 37:06.542
This appears to be

37:04.959 --> 37:06.542
the instrument

37:06.542 --> 37:08.583
Dr. Manheim described.

37:08.583 --> 37:11.709
It should confirm when the

37:08.583 --> 37:11.709
next time effect will occur.

37:11.709 --> 37:14.000
Data, did Manheim give

37:11.709 --> 37:14.000
you enough information

37:14.000 --> 37:15.583
to decipher

37:14.000 --> 37:15.583
the security code?

37:15.583 --> 37:18.208
I will know in a moment, sir.

37:18.208 --> 37:21.542
According to calculations

37:21.542 --> 37:24.750
the next time effect will occur

37:21.542 --> 37:24.750
in one minute, 30 seconds.

37:24.750 --> 37:28.208
What's the next

37:24.750 --> 37:28.208
step, Mr. Data?

37:28.208 --> 37:31.750
I will need to add a specific

37:28.208 --> 37:31.750
amount of antimatter

37:31.750 --> 37:33.750
to rebalance

37:31.750 --> 37:33.750
and align the system.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.792
PICARD:

37:33.750 --> 37:35.792
Will that plug the hole?

37:35.792 --> 37:37.792
Theoretically, yes.

37:37.792 --> 37:40.875
In reality, I do not know.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.125
When the effect hits

37:51.125 --> 37:53.208
the force fields will align

37:53.208 --> 37:57.542
opening a clean, straight path

37:53.208 --> 37:57.542
to the other dimension.

37:57.542 --> 37:59.500
Whatever the time distortion

37:59.500 --> 38:03.417
I must add the antimatter

37:59.500 --> 38:03.417
at the appropriate moment.

38:03.417 --> 38:05.375
Geordi, if the professor

38:03.417 --> 38:05.375
was right

38:05.375 --> 38:07.208
I will need

38:05.375 --> 38:07.208
a 27-second countdown.

38:07.208 --> 38:09.208
You've got it, Data.

38:10.709 --> 38:13.542
Captain, I now have

38:10.709 --> 38:13.542
the antimatter

38:13.542 --> 38:15.834
and am moving towards

38:13.542 --> 38:15.834
the opening

38:15.834 --> 38:17.750
at the end of the lab.

38:17.750 --> 38:22.792
The next time distortion

38:17.750 --> 38:22.792
should occur within seconds.

38:22.792 --> 38:27.625
Geordi, begin countdown

38:22.792 --> 38:27.625
on my mark.

38:31.959 --> 38:33.333
<i>Now.</i>

38:33.333 --> 38:35.750
LA FORGE:

38:33.333 --> 38:35.750
27, 26, 25...

38:35.750 --> 38:41.000
(<i> echoing</i> ):

38:35.750 --> 38:41.000
24-4, 23-3, 22-2, 21-1, 20...

38:41.000 --> 38:42.250
Captain

38:42.250 --> 38:44.417
there appear

38:42.250 --> 38:44.417
to be three of us.

38:44.417 --> 38:46.750
Should I drop

38:44.417 --> 38:46.750
the antimatter

38:46.750 --> 38:48.083
or wait for one of you?

38:48.083 --> 38:49.250
Only one of us

38:49.250 --> 38:51.333
is in the correct

38:49.250 --> 38:51.333
time continuum.

38:51.333 --> 38:52.667
Which one?

38:52.667 --> 38:54.417
Me.

38:54.417 --> 38:56.500
It's me.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.250
LA FORGE:

38:56.500 --> 38:58.250
Fi-fi-five, fo-fo-four,

38:56.500 --> 38:58.250
thr-thr-three

38:58.250 --> 39:00.583
tw-tw-two, one-one-one.

38:58.250 --> 39:00.583
Now-now-now.

39:04.208 --> 39:07.041
PICARD:

39:04.208 --> 39:07.041
Data, report.

39:07.041 --> 39:08.375
Are you all right?

39:08.375 --> 39:09.333
Yes, sir.

39:09.333 --> 39:10.667
PICARD:

39:09.333 --> 39:10.667
Is it closed?

39:12.792 --> 39:14.250
It is well-patched, sir.

39:14.250 --> 39:16.000
Closed indicates

39:14.250 --> 39:16.000
a permanent condition

39:16.000 --> 39:17.875
which I cannot guarantee.

39:17.875 --> 39:19.959
Patched is good enough.

39:19.959 --> 39:22.041
Well done.

39:22.041 --> 39:23.834
Beam back immediately.

39:23.834 --> 39:27.583
With pleasure, sir.

39:31.291 --> 39:33.166
This is amazing.

39:33.166 --> 39:38.458
All your readings are

39:33.166 --> 39:38.458
completely normal.

39:38.458 --> 39:40.083
Where is my wife?

39:38.458 --> 39:40.083
Is she all right?

39:40.083 --> 39:42.000
She's right here.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.041
Jenice.

39:43.041 --> 39:44.250
Paul.

39:44.250 --> 39:46.333
The effect has

39:44.250 --> 39:46.333
been reversed.

39:46.333 --> 39:47.792
I can feel it.

39:47.792 --> 39:49.709
We're safe.

39:49.709 --> 39:50.875
How is he?

39:50.875 --> 39:52.000
He needs rest.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.500
There might be some

39:52.000 --> 39:53.500
residual effects

39:53.500 --> 39:56.625
but other than that,

39:53.500 --> 39:56.625
he'll be all right.

39:56.625 --> 40:00.208
I feel like I am coming

39:56.625 --> 40:00.208
out of a long tunnel.

40:00.208 --> 40:01.500
It's there.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.041
Not at all like I thought

40:01.500 --> 40:04.041
it would be--

40:04.041 --> 40:05.000
different.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.333
Describe it.

40:07.333 --> 40:10.792
I can't. Not yet.

40:10.792 --> 40:12.834
The only words that fit

40:10.792 --> 40:12.834
are too pale

40:12.834 --> 40:16.792
because the images

40:12.834 --> 40:16.792
are so vibrant.

40:16.792 --> 40:20.166
It's not like anything, anyone

40:16.792 --> 40:20.166
has ever experienced before.

40:20.166 --> 40:21.458
There was....

40:21.458 --> 40:25.291
no, no, there<i> is</i>

40:21.458 --> 40:25.291
this kind of life--

40:25.291 --> 40:30.583
not like us, not like this...

40:30.583 --> 40:33.583
What's the condition

40:30.583 --> 40:33.583
of my lab?

40:33.583 --> 40:37.250
Intact, for the most part.

40:37.250 --> 40:39.875
Don't tell me

40:37.250 --> 40:39.875
we're going back.

40:39.875 --> 40:42.542
Oh, Jenice, we are

40:39.875 --> 40:42.542
so close.

40:42.542 --> 40:45.041
We have learned so much

40:42.542 --> 40:45.041
to walk away.

40:45.041 --> 40:48.208
Besides, we owe it

40:45.041 --> 40:48.208
to the others, our friends.

40:48.208 --> 40:50.667
There have been

40:48.208 --> 40:50.667
so many sacrifices

40:50.667 --> 40:55.291
by so many good people.

40:55.291 --> 40:58.542
We'll be going back.

40:58.542 --> 41:02.083
Mm-hmm, yes, I can see that.

41:02.083 --> 41:03.583
I'm sure the Federation

41:02.083 --> 41:03.583
will want to help

41:03.583 --> 41:05.458
in any way that it can.

41:05.458 --> 41:09.625
Thank you.

41:09.625 --> 41:12.667
This time,

41:09.625 --> 41:12.667
it will be different.

41:12.667 --> 41:13.792
I promise.

41:13.792 --> 41:15.458
(<i> laughing</i> )

41:15.458 --> 41:18.667
It always is,

41:15.458 --> 41:18.667
my love.

41:18.667 --> 41:22.041
You said my life

41:18.667 --> 41:22.041
would never be dull

41:22.041 --> 41:24.333
and it never has been.

41:24.333 --> 41:26.583
Thank you.

41:37.500 --> 41:39.709
Computer, this is

41:37.500 --> 41:39.709
Counselor Troi.

41:39.709 --> 41:41.041
Request access.

41:41.041 --> 41:43.125
Do you wish to terminate

41:41.041 --> 41:43.125
the current program?

41:43.125 --> 41:44.709
No, continue the program.

41:44.709 --> 41:47.709
Enter when ready.

41:47.709 --> 41:49.875
The Captain is waiting

41:47.709 --> 41:49.875
for you inside.

41:55.875 --> 41:57.917
How is this possible?

41:57.917 --> 42:01.208
It's Paris.

42:01.208 --> 42:02.792
Unbelievable.

42:04.917 --> 42:07.291
Madame, this way.

42:07.291 --> 42:08.542
The Captain is

42:07.291 --> 42:08.542
waiting for you.

42:12.625 --> 42:13.834
This is so real.

42:13.834 --> 42:16.583
<i>Bien sur. Pourquoi pas?</i>

42:19.458 --> 42:22.333
Jean-Luc, don't tell me

42:19.458 --> 42:22.333
how you did it.

42:22.333 --> 42:25.083
I don't care.

42:25.083 --> 42:27.166
It's perfect.

42:27.166 --> 42:29.250
It's as if we

42:27.166 --> 42:29.250
were really there.

42:33.875 --> 42:37.000
I wanted to say good-bye

42:33.875 --> 42:37.000
properly this time.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.542
(<i> champagne fizzing</i> )

42:44.667 --> 42:47.166
I shall always

42:44.667 --> 42:47.166
picture you here.

42:47.166 --> 42:49.083
(<i> glasses clink</i> )

42:54.208 --> 42:57.417
I expect you to always come

42:54.208 --> 42:57.417
charging to my rescue.

42:57.417 --> 42:59.792
I'll do my best.

43:02.917 --> 43:04.542
Good-bye, Jean-Luc.

43:04.542 --> 43:07.000
Be well.

43:08.542 --> 43:09.917
And you.

43:09.917 --> 43:12.125
Thank you for Paris.

43:21.250 --> 43:25.542
Well, so much for my

43:21.250 --> 43:25.542
dramatically romantic exit.

43:50.750 --> 43:52.500
Is anything

43:50.750 --> 43:52.500
wrong?

43:52.500 --> 43:53.625
No, sir.

43:53.625 --> 43:56.417
Then set course

43:53.625 --> 43:56.417
for Sarona VIII.

43:56.417 --> 43:59.000
As I remember

43:59.000 --> 44:01.875
we were on our way for some

43:59.000 --> 44:01.875
much-needed shore leave.

44:01.875 --> 44:04.375
Course plotted

44:01.875 --> 44:04.375
and laid in, sir.

44:04.375 --> 44:06.792
Warp five.

44:06.792 --> 44:09.333
Engage.

44:09.333 --> 44:11.834
I've only been there once, but

44:09.333 --> 44:11.834
they've got this great club.

44:11.834 --> 44:13.208
I don't remember

44:11.834 --> 44:13.208
the name of it--

44:13.208 --> 44:14.792
they serve those

44:13.208 --> 44:14.792
blue concoctions.

44:14.792 --> 44:16.125
It's across the square

44:16.125 --> 44:18.125
from the Zanza Men's

44:16.125 --> 44:18.125
Dance Palace.

44:20.333 --> 44:22.750
It's called

44:20.333 --> 44:22.750
the Blue Parrot Cafe.

44:22.750 --> 44:24.625
And you're buying.
