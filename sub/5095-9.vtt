WEBVTT

00:06.264 --> 00:07.731
(siren blaring)

00:07.733 --> 00:08.933
(crowd chatter)

00:08.935 --> 00:10.868
First on the scene?
Yup.

00:10.870 --> 00:11.699
What we got?

00:11.700 --> 00:13.398
Victim's coming out
of the synagogue here.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.567
Some guy on a motorcycle
rode on the sidewalk,

00:15.568 --> 00:17.102
shot him in the head
and rode off.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.037
CSU and MLI
just arrived.

00:19.039 --> 00:21.807
Witnesses?
One. The man sitting on the steps.

00:21.809 --> 00:23.075
He's the rabbi.

00:23.077 --> 00:24.409
Son of a gun.

00:24.411 --> 00:26.011
(garbled radio transmission)

00:26.013 --> 00:28.180
Cover him up, okay?
Sure thing.

00:28.182 --> 00:29.648
I think I recognize this guy.

00:29.650 --> 00:31.249
(siren blaring)

00:31.251 --> 00:33.618
Rabbi?
Yes.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.087
Detective Reagan and Baez.

00:35.089 --> 00:37.656
You mind if we ask you
a few questions?

00:37.658 --> 00:39.858
Sorry. You know...

00:41.294 --> 00:43.829
He was my good friend.

00:43.831 --> 00:45.430
Herman Kleiner?

00:45.432 --> 00:46.932
Judge Herman
Kleiner, you know?

00:46.934 --> 00:49.334
Judge Kleiner from the Bronx, yeah.
That's right.

00:49.336 --> 00:51.369
We had our weekly meeting.

00:51.371 --> 00:54.439
He's, uh, a member of
the executive committee.

00:54.441 --> 00:57.542
We'd come out for
our, uh, walk.

00:57.544 --> 00:59.611
Traditionally, we take
a small cigar together

00:59.613 --> 01:01.313
after the meeting.

01:01.315 --> 01:03.214
You happen to get a look
at the shooter?

01:03.216 --> 01:07.252
No. All happened so fast,
and he was wearing a helmet

01:07.254 --> 01:11.222
with a... you know,
a mask, a-a-a...

01:11.224 --> 01:12.157
A visor?

01:12.159 --> 01:13.691
BAEZ:
What makes you say

01:13.693 --> 01:14.693
it was a he?

01:14.694 --> 01:15.694
He spoke.

01:15.695 --> 01:17.362
What did he say?

01:17.364 --> 01:20.465
He-he was idling by the curb

01:20.467 --> 01:24.235
and he called out
“Herman Irving Kleiner.”

01:24.237 --> 01:28.406
And, uh, we looked over,
and he came at us.

01:28.408 --> 01:29.774
That's all he said?

01:29.776 --> 01:32.010
He just yelled out
the judge's name, nothing else?

01:32.012 --> 01:34.345
His full name, almost
the way that, uh,

01:34.347 --> 01:38.683
the parent addresses
the unruly child.

01:38.685 --> 01:40.384
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.

01:40.386 --> 01:42.153
I'm sorry.

01:42.155 --> 01:43.521
This is my wife.

01:43.523 --> 01:46.023
That's all right.
Take it outside the tape, okay?

01:47.826 --> 01:50.895
What do you think?

01:50.897 --> 01:53.364
Judge Kleiner's got
a longstanding reputation

01:53.366 --> 01:56.100
as the toughest hanging judge
in all of the Bronx.

01:56.102 --> 01:58.236
“Long Term Her”"
they call him.

01:58.238 --> 01:59.403
So you're thinking

01:59.405 --> 02:01.405
someone got out of prison
looking for revenge?

02:01.407 --> 02:03.874
I think if somebody wanted
their revenge on the judge,

02:03.876 --> 02:05.276
they got it.

02:05.278 --> 02:07.211
Let's get to work.

02:09.881 --> 02:13.451
What, if anything, did you find
inside the canister?

02:13.453 --> 02:14.752
I recovered
a .38 caliber revolver

02:14.754 --> 02:15.920
from inside the canister.

02:15.922 --> 02:17.121
Can you tell us

02:17.123 --> 02:19.123
the ballistics report
on that gun?

02:19.125 --> 02:20.724
They match the bullets found

02:20.726 --> 02:23.394
in the skull of the victim,
Thomas Dunne.

02:23.396 --> 02:25.129
ERIN: And what did you do
with that gun?

02:25.131 --> 02:27.398
I vouchered it with the property clerk.
Can you

02:27.400 --> 02:28.966
walk us through
the vouchering process?

02:28.968 --> 02:30.201
Uh, procedure is,

02:30.203 --> 02:32.937
I safeguard the weapon,
bring it back to my command,

02:32.939 --> 02:35.339
obtain a voucher,
and using a scribe,

02:35.341 --> 02:37.775
scratch my initials
on the frame.

02:38.743 --> 02:41.412
Detective,

02:41.414 --> 02:44.281
is this the gun that you found

02:44.283 --> 02:46.150
inside the sugar canister

02:46.152 --> 02:49.420
in Mr. Martin's apartment?

02:56.761 --> 02:59.663
No, I don't believe it is.

02:59.665 --> 03:01.999
Are you sure?

03:03.368 --> 03:05.068
Yes, ma'am.

03:05.070 --> 03:06.503
I don't see my initials.

03:06.505 --> 03:08.739
This is not the gun I vouchered.

03:08.741 --> 03:10.974
(gallery murmuring)

03:18.449 --> 03:19.950
(sighs)

03:19.952 --> 03:21.852
(knocking)
Sir?

03:21.854 --> 03:23.653
Punch me out, Baker.
You, too.

03:23.655 --> 03:27.224
DCPI Moore and Special Assistant
Gormley asked me to keep you.

03:27.226 --> 03:28.892
For?

03:28.894 --> 03:30.760
They're on their way up
from the second floor.

03:30.762 --> 03:32.696
Sorry to keep you.

03:32.698 --> 03:35.532
Am I gonna be sorry you did?

03:35.534 --> 03:36.933
Uh, Sid?

03:36.935 --> 03:38.101
Sergeant.

03:38.103 --> 03:39.669
About a half hour ago,

03:39.671 --> 03:41.204
one Joshua Greenwald,

03:41.206 --> 03:43.473
a prominent Manhattan attorney,
was shot

03:43.475 --> 03:45.909
by an assailant
riding a motorcycle

03:45.911 --> 03:47.911
outside a restaurant
on the Lower East Side.

03:47.913 --> 03:50.947
He was DOA at the scene.

03:50.949 --> 03:52.215
Witnesses?

03:52.217 --> 03:54.250
Three of his colleagues
from the office.

03:54.252 --> 03:56.286
And they also heard
the assailant

03:56.288 --> 03:58.988
call out the victim
by his full name?

03:58.990 --> 04:01.524
Two nights, two hits,
both victims Jewish.

04:01.526 --> 04:04.627
Both shot by a guy
on a motorcycle.

04:04.629 --> 04:08.831
Baker, call Shanghai Luck
and order us all some dinner.

04:14.972 --> 04:17.140
Okay, watch your step.

04:17.142 --> 04:18.841
We're back here
again Sunday night

04:18.843 --> 04:20.709
from, from 6:00 to 9:00,

04:20.712 --> 04:22.512
so, uh, check back with me.

04:22.514 --> 04:24.147
Thank you so much.

04:24.149 --> 04:25.515
<i>De nada.</i>

04:25.517 --> 04:26.649
You feel better.

04:26.651 --> 04:29.352
Thank you.

04:29.354 --> 04:31.621
Hello?

04:31.623 --> 04:33.723
We're open for ten more minutes
if you want to...

04:33.725 --> 04:35.591
<i>Estamos</i>

04:35.593 --> 04:37.527

04:37.529 --> 04:38.995

04:38.997 --> 04:41.063
(screams) Keep your mouth shut
and give me your money!

04:41.065 --> 04:42.065
Give me the money now!

04:42.066 --> 04:43.099
Oh, God. You know what?

04:43.101 --> 04:44.634
Give me your money now!
I have $20!

04:44.636 --> 04:47.169
That's all I got! Just take it,
I swear, please, please...

04:47.171 --> 04:48.004
Okay.

04:48.006 --> 04:51.207
(grunting)
Okay.

04:51.209 --> 04:53.109
The wedding ring!
Take off your wedding ring!

04:53.111 --> 04:55.644
Give me the wedding ring now!

04:57.014 --> 04:58.848
No!

04:58.850 --> 05:01.917
No! No!

05:03.086 --> 05:04.520
No! No!

05:04.522 --> 05:06.322
MAN: Nurse?
Call 911!

05:06.324 --> 05:09.525

I'm Leon Bendix.

05:43.681 --> 05:44.747
You're the detectives?

05:44.749 --> 05:46.248
Reagan and Baez.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.083
You were Judge Kleiner's clerk.

05:48.085 --> 05:49.685
For nearly 22 years.

05:49.687 --> 05:51.420
You heard about
the second murder?

05:51.422 --> 05:53.422
The lawyer, Joshua Greenwald.

05:53.424 --> 05:54.923
Yeah, I read about that.

05:54.925 --> 05:57.059
This Joshua Greenwald,
did he ever argue...?

05:57.061 --> 05:59.395
I checked-- he never argued
before Judge Kleiner.

05:59.397 --> 06:01.997
You're sure?
I'm positive.

06:01.999 --> 06:04.633
Judge Kleiner, he had a
very, uh, tough reputation.

06:04.635 --> 06:06.468
Yeah, he was tough.

06:06.470 --> 06:08.904
But never
on the first-time offenders.

06:08.906 --> 06:10.506
The frequent flyers?

06:10.508 --> 06:12.474
He didn't have
patience for that.

06:12.476 --> 06:13.509
Can you think of anyone

06:13.511 --> 06:14.743
the judge put away
who might have...?

06:14.745 --> 06:16.979
I figured somebody
would ask me that.

06:16.981 --> 06:20.749
These are the court files on the
people that I remember thinking,

06:20.751 --> 06:24.186
when they get out, Judge Kleiner
wouldn't want to bump into them.

06:24.188 --> 06:26.221
Any of them ever threaten
the judge directly?

06:26.223 --> 06:27.289
Hell, yeah.

06:27.291 --> 06:28.757
Yeah, they said it all.

06:28.759 --> 06:31.260
“I'll shoot you.”
“I'll beat your kids.”

06:31.262 --> 06:33.428
“Burn your house down
with you in it.”

06:33.430 --> 06:34.763
All of that.

06:34.765 --> 06:35.931
It's all in the files.

06:35.933 --> 06:38.900
All right. We'll take a look.

06:42.905 --> 06:45.407
(knocking)

06:45.409 --> 06:47.576
Come in, Olivia.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.414
Personnel folder
on Detective Hardy.

06:52.416 --> 06:55.183
Thanks.

06:55.648 --> 06:57.615
You get your LSAT
results back yet?

06:57.617 --> 07:00.017
Uh, Friday.

07:00.019 --> 07:01.652
I remember that feeling.

07:01.654 --> 07:04.288
Here you are under the gun,

07:04.290 --> 07:06.857
and you're asking me
about my LSATs?

07:06.859 --> 07:09.593
“Under the gun”--
no pun intended?

07:09.595 --> 07:11.729
(laughs)
And making jokes.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.364
Good lawyer can do
three things at once.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.599
Can you let in Detective
McBride, please?

07:18.069 --> 07:21.972
Detective?

07:21.974 --> 07:23.540
(door closes)

07:23.542 --> 07:24.808
You got anything?

07:24.810 --> 07:26.210
Just a voucher for the gun.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.312
Stamped at 13:43
the day before the trial

07:28.314 --> 07:31.014
when Hardy retrieved it
from the property clerk.

07:31.016 --> 07:34.418
He's pictured with his I.D.

07:34.420 --> 07:35.986
Well, that's what he told me.

07:35.988 --> 07:37.321
Yeah.

07:39.357 --> 07:43.026
So, either someone got to Hardy

07:43.028 --> 07:45.496
and he switched out the guns
before he gave it to me,

07:45.498 --> 07:48.065
or someone from this office
went into the safe

07:48.067 --> 07:50.200
after I locked it in there

07:50.202 --> 07:52.369
and switched out those guns.

07:52.371 --> 07:55.305
How many people have access?

07:55.307 --> 07:57.474
A handful of ADAs.

07:57.476 --> 07:59.276
I mean, you need to swipe
to get in that room.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.345
You need to know the
combination to the safe.

08:01.347 --> 08:02.846
It doesn't make sense.

08:02.848 --> 08:04.948
None of this makes any sense.

08:04.950 --> 08:07.317
I'll get a hold of the swipe
records from the safe room.

08:07.319 --> 08:11.188
Here's a subpoena for
Hardy's financial records.

08:11.190 --> 08:12.456
I want to run him
through FinCEN,

08:12.458 --> 08:14.424
see if he's having
any money trouble.

08:14.426 --> 08:16.359
You think...?

08:16.361 --> 08:18.161
I think I don't know
who the hell did this,

08:18.163 --> 08:20.230
and everyone is in play.

08:20.232 --> 08:23.867
Got it.

08:23.869 --> 08:25.936
Alex?

08:25.938 --> 08:27.170
Yeah?

08:27.172 --> 08:28.738
That missing gun?

08:28.740 --> 08:30.740
Ballistics match
the three bullets

08:30.742 --> 08:32.275
recovered from
the victim's head.

08:32.277 --> 08:33.977
We have that gun,
we have a case.

08:33.979 --> 08:35.812
No gun, no case.

08:35.813 --> 08:38.548
Judge gave us until Monday
morning at 9:00 a.m.

08:38.549 --> 08:41.217
Copy that, Ms. Reagan.

08:41.219 --> 08:44.154
(door opens)

08:45.723 --> 08:48.424
When you and Donald Stein
part after meeting,

08:48.426 --> 08:49.559
who kisses whose ring?

08:49.561 --> 08:50.727
Neither. It is a bear hug

08:50.729 --> 08:52.996
and a “my best to your family.”

08:52.998 --> 08:54.664
I wonder what that
much money feels like.

08:54.666 --> 08:56.933
Today I guess it feels
like a ride up

08:56.935 --> 08:59.068
to the 14th floor
in my private elevator.

08:59.070 --> 09:00.169
(elevator dings)
Don.

09:00.171 --> 09:02.905
Frank. Thanks for seeing me.

09:02.907 --> 09:04.807
You remember my DCPI...

09:04.809 --> 09:05.942
Garrett, of course.
Good to see you.

09:05.944 --> 09:08.044
And, uh, thanks
for making him available.

09:08.046 --> 09:09.579
My pleasure, Mr. Stein.

09:09.581 --> 09:12.215
Please, Mr. Stein's my father.

09:12.217 --> 09:14.283
How many times have
you had to say that?

09:14.285 --> 09:16.619
Countless millions.

09:16.621 --> 09:17.720
(laughs)

09:17.722 --> 09:19.589
Uh, where can we talk?

09:19.591 --> 09:21.891
In my office.

09:24.361 --> 09:25.928
I'm very concerned.

09:25.930 --> 09:28.831
As am I.

09:28.833 --> 09:32.635
I'm not hearing “hate crime”
from this building.

09:32.637 --> 09:35.304
Do you want to?

09:35.306 --> 09:37.974
I want it acknowledged
that prominent Jews

09:37.976 --> 09:40.776
are the targets
of an assassin.

09:40.778 --> 09:43.579
One who is still
at large in our city.

09:43.581 --> 09:45.348
From where I sit?

09:45.350 --> 09:47.750
Please, go ahead.

09:47.752 --> 09:49.251
Two men were murdered

09:49.253 --> 09:50.920
in cold blood by a perp

09:50.922 --> 09:53.689
who fits eyewitness
descriptions

09:53.691 --> 09:56.392
at both scenes.

09:56.394 --> 09:58.460
I have no physical evidence,

09:58.462 --> 10:00.563
no chatter on the wires,

10:00.565 --> 10:04.600
no anti-Semitic groups
claiming responsibility.

10:04.602 --> 10:07.903
So, you're painting it
as coincidence?

10:07.905 --> 10:11.273
Well, I could call it a
hate crime in that the perp

10:11.275 --> 10:13.308
clearly had hatred
for his victims.

10:13.310 --> 10:15.144
He did, after all, murder them.

10:15.146 --> 10:16.178
Frank...
But

10:16.180 --> 10:18.947
in this minute,

10:18.949 --> 10:21.550
I have no evidence

10:21.552 --> 10:23.185
that they were killed because

10:23.187 --> 10:26.121
of their faith or ethnicity.

10:29.392 --> 10:32.661
Why do you think he states
their full names before he acts?

10:32.663 --> 10:35.330
I don't know.

10:35.332 --> 10:38.800
And that fact wasn't
released to the press.

10:38.802 --> 10:40.202
I didn't learn it
from the press.

10:40.204 --> 10:41.603
Don?

10:41.605 --> 10:44.606
I'm sure you have ways
of gaining information

10:44.608 --> 10:47.743
that I have no idea you had.

10:47.745 --> 10:50.045
But you're going
to have to be clear

10:50.047 --> 10:52.447
about what you're
looking for from me

10:52.449 --> 10:55.517
here in this minute.

10:57.987 --> 11:00.155
I think you should put special
details at our synagogues.

11:00.157 --> 11:02.157
All of them.

11:02.159 --> 11:04.926
To what end?

11:04.928 --> 11:09.464
To send a signal that the NYPD
takes this threat seriously.

11:09.466 --> 11:12.133
I don't think
using our resources

11:12.135 --> 11:15.003
to guard real estate sends
an effective signal.

11:15.005 --> 11:17.372
You don't?

11:17.374 --> 11:20.809
Not at this time.

11:20.811 --> 11:22.544
And that signal is
loud and clear

11:22.546 --> 11:24.179
if you know what to look for.

11:24.181 --> 11:28.883
Namely, all the best detectives
I have, all over this thing,

11:28.885 --> 11:31.219
all their days and nights.

11:38.961 --> 11:41.229
Thanks for
your time, Frank.

11:42.097 --> 11:44.065
My best
to your family.

11:44.067 --> 11:46.667
And mine to yours.

11:58.113 --> 11:59.413
Hey.

11:59.415 --> 12:00.415
Hey.

12:00.416 --> 12:01.682
Long time no see.

12:01.684 --> 12:03.684
You work late
last night?

12:03.686 --> 12:04.986
Yeah.

12:04.988 --> 12:06.153
I'm grabbing a beer.

12:06.155 --> 12:07.755
Danny?

12:07.757 --> 12:09.890
Yeah.

12:12.260 --> 12:13.527
Want one?

12:13.529 --> 12:15.563
Danny, I...

12:15.565 --> 12:17.231
I got mugged last night.

12:19.034 --> 12:21.869
And they...
they took my silver chain.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.704
You know,
my grandma's silver chain.

12:23.706 --> 12:25.706
Yeah.

12:25.708 --> 12:27.675
Oh, my God.

12:27.677 --> 12:30.077
Why the hell didn't
you call me?

12:30.079 --> 12:32.279
I don't know.

12:33.281 --> 12:34.281
I'm so sorry.

12:34.283 --> 12:35.382
You all right?

12:35.384 --> 12:37.518
Uh, yeah, I'm just a
little shook up, you know?

12:37.520 --> 12:38.552
Who did it?

12:38.554 --> 12:40.554
Some kid, he
showed a knife.

12:40.556 --> 12:41.556
A knife.

12:41.557 --> 12:42.890
Okay, well,
did you report it?

12:42.892 --> 12:44.291
Yeah.

12:45.560 --> 12:46.594
(sighs)
Okay.

12:46.596 --> 12:47.695
So, w-what happened?

12:47.697 --> 12:49.063
You were coming out
of the hospital? What?

12:49.065 --> 12:52.399
I was at the
Jefferson Houses.

12:52.401 --> 12:53.634
W-W-Wha...?

12:53.636 --> 12:55.703
What the hell were you doing
at the Jefferson Houses?

12:55.705 --> 12:57.504
Okay, calm down.
I am calm.

12:57.506 --> 12:59.440
What were you doing
at the Jefferson Houses?

12:59.442 --> 13:01.075
I-I take a shift
there once a week

13:01.077 --> 13:02.176
with the mobile
hospital unit.

13:02.178 --> 13:04.545
So, I was coming
out of the trailer,

13:04.547 --> 13:06.413
and some punk
pulls a knife.

13:06.415 --> 13:07.848
Mm-hmm.

13:07.850 --> 13:10.712
Do they provide security
for you when you do this?

13:10.736 --> 13:11.452
No, come on.

13:11.453 --> 13:13.420
Well, then that's
the end of that.

13:13.422 --> 13:15.122
Danny, I like
doing it.

13:15.124 --> 13:16.223
Well, I like smoking.

13:16.225 --> 13:17.991
But I quit 'cause
it's bad for me.

13:17.993 --> 13:18.892
Oh, so we're just...

13:18.894 --> 13:19.993
we're making
jokes now, huh?

13:19.995 --> 13:21.328
Is that right?
I'm not making jokes.

13:21.330 --> 13:22.829
But you're the one making jokes
if you think

13:22.831 --> 13:24.698
I'm gonna let you go back
to the Jefferson Houses

13:24.700 --> 13:25.700
without security.

13:25.701 --> 13:27.234
You're not going back.

13:27.236 --> 13:29.169
No, Danny.

13:29.171 --> 13:31.671
You know, this is about me
making a difference here.

13:31.673 --> 13:33.240
Where do you get off
chastising me

13:33.242 --> 13:34.775
for sticking
my neck out,

13:34.777 --> 13:35.876
trying to help people?

13:35.878 --> 13:37.377
That's what you
do every day.

13:37.379 --> 13:38.678
Yeah, I help people
every day.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.447
And I carry a gun
when I do it.

13:40.449 --> 13:42.549
Well, so what, you're
just gonna forbid me?

13:42.551 --> 13:44.751
Oh, come on, what are you
talking about, “forbid you”?

13:44.753 --> 13:46.553
I let you work
at the hospital, don't I?

13:46.555 --> 13:47.621
You “let me”?!

13:47.623 --> 13:50.624
I didn't mean it
like that.

13:50.626 --> 13:52.559
Okay? It came
out wrong.

13:52.561 --> 13:54.327
All I'm saying is

13:54.329 --> 13:56.796
that you do not have
to take that risk going there.

13:56.798 --> 13:58.164
That's not for
you to say.

13:58.166 --> 14:00.133
Come on.
That's... Don't. (cell phone rings)

14:03.104 --> 14:05.004
Go ahead.

14:05.006 --> 14:07.173
(sighs)

14:08.609 --> 14:10.076
Reagan.

14:10.078 --> 14:13.446
There's been another murder.

14:13.448 --> 14:15.515
Sutton Place.

14:15.517 --> 14:17.717
A Dr. Feinberg
walking his dog alone.

14:17.719 --> 14:19.018
Doorman heard a couple of pops

14:19.020 --> 14:21.454
and saw a guy on a motorcycle
run a red light.

14:21.456 --> 14:22.522
Who's on the scene?

14:22.524 --> 14:24.123
Detectives from the 18th squad.

14:24.125 --> 14:25.858
They'll brief us when
they're done up there.

14:25.860 --> 14:26.826
Have a good night.

14:26.828 --> 14:29.028
Fat chance of that.

14:30.698 --> 14:32.231
I'm going to bed.

14:32.233 --> 14:34.667
We don't go to bed angry
in this house, Linda.

14:34.669 --> 14:36.402
Tonight we do.

14:36.404 --> 14:38.571
Linda...

14:39.473 --> 14:41.674
Linda.

14:55.330 --> 14:56.797
(knocking on window)

14:56.799 --> 14:59.733
Come in!

14:59.735 --> 15:02.302
Anything?

15:02.304 --> 15:03.737
Not on Hardy.

15:03.739 --> 15:06.039
Looked at his credit,
his personnel records,

15:06.041 --> 15:08.108
talked to IAB,
nothing.

15:08.110 --> 15:10.210
If he's a dirty cop,
then I'm Miley Cyrus.

15:10.212 --> 15:13.180
Point me somewhere.

15:13.182 --> 15:14.281
I wish I could.

15:14.283 --> 15:16.016
I got the swipe records
from the safe room.

15:16.018 --> 15:18.218
You were the only one that
swiped in there that morning.

15:18.220 --> 15:19.319
You swiped in twice.

15:19.321 --> 15:20.454
Twice?

15:20.456 --> 15:21.588
No.

15:21.590 --> 15:22.856
Yeah.

15:22.858 --> 15:24.291
No, I was in there once.

15:24.293 --> 15:25.726
You're sure?

15:25.728 --> 15:27.327
Yeah, I'm sure.

15:27.329 --> 15:28.929
I went in there
for the evidence bags--

15:28.931 --> 15:30.697
three of them,
including the gun.

15:30.699 --> 15:33.400
Then that means somebody
took your card.

15:33.402 --> 15:34.734
Where do you keep it?

15:34.736 --> 15:38.171
I usually keep it
in my bag or on my desk.

15:38.173 --> 15:40.173
Who could know that?

15:40.175 --> 15:42.809
Just about anyone
out there on the floor.

15:42.811 --> 15:47.013
People are in and out
of here all day long.

15:49.884 --> 15:52.986
Somebody have it in for you?

15:52.988 --> 15:55.488
I can't believe someone I
work with despises me enough

15:55.490 --> 15:57.791
to blow up a case of
a truly vicious killer

15:57.793 --> 16:00.527
just to get at me.

16:00.529 --> 16:02.796
Am I really
that naive?

16:02.798 --> 16:05.198
That's not exactly what I meant.

16:09.670 --> 16:11.371
You a sneaky bastard?

16:11.373 --> 16:12.872
That a trick question?

16:12.874 --> 16:14.240
No, I need to know.

16:14.242 --> 16:16.342
It's a tool
on my belt.

16:18.646 --> 16:20.947
I want you to get a
rumor out on the floor,

16:20.949 --> 16:22.649
one that's gonna go
viral in a second,

16:22.651 --> 16:25.284
that we were able to get DNA
samples off the evidence bags,

16:25.286 --> 16:28.454
and we're gonna swab everyone
first thing in the morning.

16:28.456 --> 16:30.723
Then we'll find out who
doesn't show up for work.

16:30.725 --> 16:32.492
Uh-huh.

16:32.494 --> 16:33.826
We've got until
Monday morning.

16:33.828 --> 16:35.895
Too many people
to do this retail.

16:35.897 --> 16:37.730
That is a good point.

16:37.732 --> 16:40.900
Obviously, this did
not come from me.

16:43.504 --> 16:45.638
(chuckles)

16:54.114 --> 16:56.248
BAEZ:
A judge, a lawyer, and a doctor.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.184
All male, all Jewish.

16:58.186 --> 17:00.152
All appear to be
upstanding citizens.

17:00.154 --> 17:04.156
And all gunned down by a lone
gunman riding a motorcycle.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.991
What else do they have
in common?

17:07.294 --> 17:09.295
What's with the phone?

17:09.297 --> 17:11.664
Nothing.
Something.

17:11.665 --> 17:14.300
All right, I'm in a little bit
of a fight with the wife.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.834
Oh.

17:15.836 --> 17:17.603
She got robbed.

17:17.605 --> 17:19.505
Portable hospital
in front of the projects.

17:19.507 --> 17:21.272
Is she okay?

17:21.275 --> 17:23.309
Yeah, she's fine.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.411
And you...?

17:25.413 --> 17:27.680
I was a little overprotective.

17:27.682 --> 17:29.782
How bad?

17:31.651 --> 17:33.852
Bad.

17:40.260 --> 17:44.129
Okay, I think I
got everything.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.298
Let's have a look.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.469
Okay, you did
everything right.

17:50.471 --> 17:52.638
Here's an info sheet
that you should study well.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.430
Got it.

17:53.454 --> 17:55.117
Now all you got to do
is get fingerprinted,

17:55.118 --> 17:56.841
and you'll get a notification
in about three months.

17:56.842 --> 17:57.971
Three months?

17:57.995 --> 17:59.452
Yeah, we got to wait
for the prints to come back.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.152
Well, isn't there
a way to expedite?

18:01.154 --> 18:02.320
Not really.

18:06.926 --> 18:08.426
Hey, uh...

18:08.428 --> 18:10.194
will this help?

18:13.999 --> 18:16.534
This is the commissioner's
courtesy card.

18:16.536 --> 18:17.869
Where did you
get this?

18:19.638 --> 18:21.673
This is my
extended family.

18:21.675 --> 18:24.308
Last summer in Quogue.

18:24.310 --> 18:26.477
What a great
day that was.

18:26.479 --> 18:29.180
How about 3:00
this afternoon, Mrs. Reagan?

18:29.182 --> 18:31.849
3:00 would be perfect.

18:31.851 --> 18:33.518
Thank you.

18:36.355 --> 18:38.656
Reagan, Baez.

18:38.658 --> 18:39.957
You guys got
a strange break.

18:39.959 --> 18:41.726
What are you
talking about?

18:41.728 --> 18:43.127
I fielded
an anonymous phone tip

18:43.129 --> 18:45.062
that a white supremacist group
called, uh, Volks Vanguard

18:45.064 --> 18:46.297
is taking credit
for the killing.

18:46.299 --> 18:47.965
Location?

18:47.967 --> 18:49.400
Cyberspace, so far.

18:49.402 --> 18:51.302
Well, what's the break?

18:51.304 --> 18:53.571
The guy who says he's their
supreme commander or something

18:53.573 --> 18:54.972
came in 20 minutes ago,

18:54.974 --> 18:56.540
wants to speak with
the investigating detectives.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.342
Where is he?
In the box.

18:59.845 --> 19:02.146
All right, thanks.

19:05.917 --> 19:07.518
Detective Reagan.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.521
My partner is
Detective Baez.

19:10.523 --> 19:12.056
You wanted to
talk to us?

19:12.058 --> 19:13.557
I do, yeah.

19:13.559 --> 19:14.558
Okay, well, let's
start with this.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.593
Who the hell are you?

19:15.595 --> 19:16.927
Calvin Benton,

19:16.929 --> 19:19.129
I'm head of the New York
<i>Ausschuss</i> of Volks Vanguard.

19:19.131 --> 19:20.131
What's that?

19:20.132 --> 19:21.365
The People's Front.

19:21.367 --> 19:22.566
Oh.

19:22.568 --> 19:24.134
People's Front.

19:24.136 --> 19:26.870
Someone's out there
on the Internet posing

19:26.872 --> 19:29.506
as being from my organization,
claiming responsibility

19:29.508 --> 19:31.975
for those three murders,
of the Jews.

19:31.977 --> 19:33.043
Well, that's funny.

19:33.045 --> 19:34.445
'Cause somebody
just called us,

19:34.447 --> 19:36.447
giving us an anonymous
tip of the same thing.

19:36.449 --> 19:37.981
You want to tell
us about that?

19:37.983 --> 19:39.483
Nothing to tell you.

19:39.485 --> 19:40.651
Wasn't us.

19:40.653 --> 19:42.886
Maybe someone
from your group acted alone.

19:42.888 --> 19:43.921
Couldn't happen.

19:43.923 --> 19:45.222
Says you.

19:45.224 --> 19:46.456
Yes.

19:46.458 --> 19:47.791
DANNY: Well, isn't
wanting to eliminate

19:47.793 --> 19:49.760
the entire Jewish
population

19:49.762 --> 19:51.862
part of your proud
and illustrious legacy?

19:51.864 --> 19:53.864
That's last-century thinking.

19:53.866 --> 19:55.265
We just want strong borders.

19:56.534 --> 19:57.834
And think--

19:57.836 --> 20:00.137
why would we take credit
for something that would put us

20:00.139 --> 20:02.406
in prison with the same animals
we want fenced off?

20:02.408 --> 20:04.474
BAEZ: We're gonna get
a search warrant

20:04.476 --> 20:05.742
for your phone and computers.

20:05.744 --> 20:07.210
No, you're not.

20:07.212 --> 20:08.412
Who the hell's
gonna stop us?

20:08.414 --> 20:10.981
It'd be a waste of time
and taxpayer dollars.

20:10.983 --> 20:12.782
I'll give you
unlimited access.

20:12.784 --> 20:14.818
I just want to
clear my good name

20:14.820 --> 20:16.453
and the good name
of my <i> Ausschuss.</i>

20:19.323 --> 20:21.491
I'll have TARU meet us.

20:22.793 --> 20:24.261
All right.

20:24.263 --> 20:26.029
Let's take a ride.

20:27.932 --> 20:29.266
This is the one.

20:29.268 --> 20:31.434
Excellent choice.

20:36.807 --> 20:39.876
How will you be paying?

20:39.878 --> 20:42.779
We'll set you up
with these to start.

20:44.615 --> 20:45.749
JAMIE:
Hey, Skip.

20:45.751 --> 20:47.417
Three boxes full metal
jacket, nine millimeter.

20:47.419 --> 20:49.185
Hey, Jamie,
be right with you.

20:49.187 --> 20:50.687
Linda?

20:50.689 --> 20:52.822
Hey, Jamie. How are you?
What's up?

20:52.824 --> 20:54.924
Danny's got you picking up
his office supplies now?

20:54.926 --> 20:56.259
Yeah, kind of.

20:56.261 --> 20:58.261
All set, ma'am.
Thank you.

20:58.263 --> 20:59.896
Uh, Jamie, listen.

20:59.898 --> 21:01.898
Don't say anything
to Danny, okay?

21:01.900 --> 21:03.633
You know, it's
kind of a surprise.

21:03.635 --> 21:05.401
What's the surprise?

21:05.403 --> 21:06.803
Let's just leave
it at that.

21:06.805 --> 21:08.438
I'll see you
on Sunday?

21:14.945 --> 21:17.914
FRANK: I've increased
patrols at synagogues,

21:17.916 --> 21:21.117
despite the fact that only one
was a crime scene.

21:21.119 --> 21:23.452
I have formed
the task force of detectives

21:23.454 --> 21:25.254
working with our major
case squad.

21:25.256 --> 21:27.523
And we appreciate that.

21:28.692 --> 21:31.594
Just so I understand clearly,

21:31.596 --> 21:33.429
you are taking out
a full-page ad

21:33.431 --> 21:36.165
in the <i> Times,</i>
signed by all of you,

21:36.167 --> 21:41.537
explaining why you are hiring
500 private security personnel

21:41.539 --> 21:44.640
to be stationed
around Manhattan.

21:44.642 --> 21:46.509
With respect.

21:46.511 --> 21:47.443
To who?

21:47.445 --> 21:49.578
To you and the NYPD.

21:49.580 --> 21:51.413
And how are you going
to show that?

21:51.415 --> 21:52.615
In the wording.

21:52.617 --> 21:54.984
No, actions speak
louder than words.

21:54.986 --> 21:58.554
And the action here sends
a loud vote of no confidence

21:58.556 --> 22:00.322
in me and my department.

22:00.324 --> 22:03.926
I wish you wouldn't
take it that way.

22:03.928 --> 22:05.961
We would also stress
in the statement

22:05.963 --> 22:07.930
that we will continue
to fully support

22:07.932 --> 22:10.466
the NYPD Police Foundation

22:10.468 --> 22:12.101
with our pledged funding.

22:12.103 --> 22:13.635
Well, that would read as,

22:13.637 --> 22:15.671
“We are going to continue
to tip generously

22:15.673 --> 22:18.106
despite the bad service.”
Not at all.

22:18.108 --> 22:19.842
Pretty much,
to anyone paying attention.

22:19.844 --> 22:21.076
WOMAN:
Frank,

22:21.078 --> 22:23.912
you seem to want to make this
us versus you.

22:23.914 --> 22:25.314
It's not.

22:25.316 --> 22:27.916
It's us versus a very real
threat out there.

22:27.918 --> 22:29.618
Three of our people are dead.

22:29.620 --> 22:33.221
Naomi...

22:33.223 --> 22:35.624
I consider them my people, too.

22:35.626 --> 22:38.627
I am responsible to every
citizen in this city.

22:38.629 --> 22:40.062
Now we're splitting hairs.

22:40.064 --> 22:41.263
Not at all.

22:41.265 --> 22:42.230
You,

22:42.232 --> 22:43.899
the people around
this table,

22:43.901 --> 22:45.133
you have
a right

22:45.135 --> 22:48.070
to be alarmed and concerned.

22:48.072 --> 22:51.173
But this siege mentality,

22:51.175 --> 22:52.808
unsupported by facts...

22:52.810 --> 22:54.643
Three dead is a fact.

22:57.346 --> 23:01.249
In my world,
it's sometimes a daily fact.

23:01.251 --> 23:02.918
Twice, on a bad weekend.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.152
Frank, please...

23:04.154 --> 23:06.087
Well, look...

23:06.089 --> 23:09.591
I appreciate you all

23:09.593 --> 23:11.192
giving me a heads up.

23:11.194 --> 23:13.461
I can't sway you
from your course...

23:14.397 --> 23:17.465
But I am the smartest person
in this room

23:17.467 --> 23:20.401
in one way only:

23:20.403 --> 23:22.237
threat assessment.

23:22.239 --> 23:24.172
And if you're not
going to listen to me,

23:24.174 --> 23:26.641
I won't waste any more
of your time.

23:26.643 --> 23:29.244
Or mine.

23:32.348 --> 23:34.048
Don't.
What?

23:34.050 --> 23:35.883
The takeaway
or the optics

23:35.885 --> 23:37.485
or whatever your
current word is.

23:37.487 --> 23:38.987
Well, I don't know
about the takeaway,

23:38.989 --> 23:40.822
but the optics
are clear as day.

23:40.824 --> 23:43.024
Black eyes
all around.

23:56.127 --> 23:58.761
(knocks)

23:58.763 --> 24:00.196
All present and accounted for?

24:00.198 --> 24:01.698
All but one.

24:01.700 --> 24:04.200
Your trial prep assistant,
Olivia Gordon.

24:04.202 --> 24:05.835
What?

24:05.837 --> 24:07.203
She ever come in late?

24:07.205 --> 24:08.972
No, never.

24:08.974 --> 24:10.606
I mean... never.

24:10.608 --> 24:11.708
She's always early.

24:11.710 --> 24:12.976
She's a smart kid.

24:12.978 --> 24:13.943
I'm-I'm writing her

24:13.945 --> 24:16.145
a law school
recommendation letter.

24:16.147 --> 24:18.147
I can't believe it's her.

24:18.149 --> 24:20.083
Why did she do it?

24:20.085 --> 24:21.884
What does she gain?

24:23.821 --> 24:25.488
I don't know.

24:25.490 --> 24:27.690
Let's go find out.

24:29.226 --> 24:31.227
Olivia!
It's Erin Reagan!

24:31.229 --> 24:32.428
Open up!

24:37.367 --> 24:39.702
I'm so sorry.

24:39.704 --> 24:40.803
You're sorry?

24:40.805 --> 24:42.071
Like that means
something?

24:42.073 --> 24:43.205
They made me.

24:43.207 --> 24:45.041
Who made
you what?

24:45.043 --> 24:46.509
Winslow and his crew.

24:46.511 --> 24:48.277
They made me
switch out the gun.

24:50.714 --> 24:51.881
Tell us what
happened.

24:51.883 --> 24:54.884
My brother used to run
with Winslow Martin.

24:54.886 --> 24:56.585
Wh...

24:56.587 --> 24:57.853
They came to me
when they found out

24:57.855 --> 24:58.988
I worked at the D.A.'s office.

24:58.990 --> 25:00.723
They told me to get the gun.

25:00.725 --> 25:02.892
I said no,

25:02.894 --> 25:04.527
I couldn't.

25:04.529 --> 25:08.397
And then, for a reply,
they sent me this.

25:08.399 --> 25:10.432
Olivia, baby.

25:10.434 --> 25:11.867
You gotta do this.

25:11.869 --> 25:13.202
You gotta get that gun.

25:13.204 --> 25:14.870
(sniffling)

25:14.872 --> 25:17.072
They're gonna kill me,
baby sister.

25:17.074 --> 25:19.208
You know they will.

25:19.210 --> 25:20.275
Help, Olivia.

25:20.277 --> 25:23.746
And they would, so I did it.

25:23.748 --> 25:24.980
I did it.

25:26.549 --> 25:28.784
Why didn't you come to me?

25:28.786 --> 25:30.886
Ms. Reagan, I was afraid.

25:30.888 --> 25:32.554
What could I do?

25:34.924 --> 25:36.091
Where's the gun?

25:36.093 --> 25:38.360
They came and got it.
Who?

25:38.362 --> 25:39.762
Ronnie and Tremaine,
Winslow's boys.

25:39.763 --> 25:42.331
And your brother?

25:42.333 --> 25:43.799
They are
holding him

25:43.801 --> 25:45.400
until Winslow walks.

25:45.402 --> 25:46.802
Okay, well, that's
not going to happen.

25:46.804 --> 25:48.370
'Cause you're going to come
down and tell the judge

25:48.372 --> 25:50.038
everything you just
told me. Come on.

25:50.040 --> 25:50.906
Do you have your cuffs?

25:50.908 --> 25:52.541
Yeah, I got my...

25:52.543 --> 25:54.409
Then put 'em on
and take me down.

25:54.411 --> 25:55.877
What are you doing?

25:55.879 --> 25:58.013
You really think that I'm going
to send my brother to his grave?

25:58.015 --> 25:58.980
Olivia, please...

25:58.982 --> 26:00.849
I have a right to a lawyer.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.951
I know that.

26:05.822 --> 26:07.055
Cuff her.

26:10.626 --> 26:11.760
Step out, please.

26:13.596 --> 26:15.664
You have the right
to remain silent...

26:15.666 --> 26:16.798
I know the law!

26:16.800 --> 26:18.500
McBRIDE:
Anything you say

26:18.502 --> 26:20.368
can and will be
used against you...

26:28.778 --> 26:31.246
Where'd Danny
and Linda go?

26:31.248 --> 26:34.549
Linda read about some pies
at a farmers market

26:34.551 --> 26:36.718
that's only open
on Sunday, so...

26:36.720 --> 26:38.453
I ran into her the other day
at Randy's.

26:38.455 --> 26:40.655
I was picking up some rounds
to go out to the range.

26:40.657 --> 26:41.856
Linda was buying a gun.

26:41.858 --> 26:43.591
For Danny?

26:43.593 --> 26:44.926
I don't think so.

26:44.928 --> 26:45.994
She took out a permit.

26:45.996 --> 26:47.795
What, you knew?

26:47.797 --> 26:49.631
Well, after the fact.

26:49.633 --> 26:51.599
She used her
commissioner courtesy card

26:51.601 --> 26:52.967
to expedite the paperwork,

26:52.969 --> 26:55.703
and the C.O. of the license
division gave me a heads up.

26:55.705 --> 26:57.338
Does Danny know?

26:57.340 --> 26:58.873
FRANK:
Don't know.

26:58.875 --> 27:00.408
She asked me not to tell him.

27:02.044 --> 27:03.578
Then don't.

27:03.580 --> 27:06.547
She wasn't kissing another man
in the gun store.

27:06.549 --> 27:08.950
She wasn't shoplifting a weapon
in the gun store.

27:08.952 --> 27:10.318
She was buying a gun,

27:10.320 --> 27:11.853
legally, in the gun store.

27:11.855 --> 27:13.821
Nobody's business but her own

27:13.823 --> 27:15.990
and whoever she chooses
to share it with.

27:15.992 --> 27:18.726
All right. Danny finds out
I knew and didn't tell him,

27:18.728 --> 27:20.661
I'm sending him after you.

27:34.943 --> 27:37.344
Well, if you ask me,
who cares if they want

27:37.346 --> 27:39.547
to put on a few extra
security guards?

27:39.549 --> 27:41.949
Not a few.
500.

27:41.951 --> 27:43.684
Are they paying for 'em?

27:43.686 --> 27:44.952
That's not the point.

27:44.954 --> 27:47.188
Then it's nobody's business
if they do.

27:47.190 --> 27:49.190
FRANK: The <i> Times</i> ad
sends a message

27:49.192 --> 27:51.258
that they had
to pick up my slack.

27:51.260 --> 27:52.993
It doesn't say that, Dad.

27:52.995 --> 27:55.462
For all intents
and purposes, it does.

27:55.464 --> 27:58.132
When did you get such
a thin skin, Francis?

27:58.134 --> 28:00.167
DANNY: Yeah, I gotta side
with Gramps on this one.

28:00.169 --> 28:02.036
People got a right
to protect themselves

28:02.038 --> 28:03.537
however
they see fit.

28:03.539 --> 28:04.872
So long as it's
within the law,

28:04.874 --> 28:07.041
whatever helps them
sleep at night, right?

28:07.043 --> 28:07.975
Mmm.

28:07.977 --> 28:09.243
Yeah, I'm with Danny
on this one.

28:09.245 --> 28:10.878
Are you now?

28:10.880 --> 28:12.446
Yeah.

28:13.348 --> 28:15.115
Jamie, Nicky?

28:16.284 --> 28:18.085
I think people
got a right.

28:18.087 --> 28:19.953
I mean, isn't it like
the right to bear arms?

28:19.955 --> 28:20.787
No.

28:20.789 --> 28:23.056
Uh, yeah, kind of.

28:23.058 --> 28:24.758
Yeah, in that you
also have the right

28:24.760 --> 28:26.827
to pick a peashooter
or a cannon?

28:26.829 --> 28:28.762
Exactly.

28:28.764 --> 28:31.965
I flew El Al once,

28:31.967 --> 28:33.700
to a chiefs
conference in Israel.

28:33.702 --> 28:35.202
This was in
the early '80s.

28:35.204 --> 28:39.206
We all thought that
their security was ridiculous,

28:39.208 --> 28:41.141
way over the top.

28:41.143 --> 28:42.876
20 years later,

28:42.878 --> 28:45.078
anyone who ever flew El Al

28:45.080 --> 28:47.681
wishes that all airlines
were like El Al.

28:47.683 --> 28:48.982
This isn't that.

28:48.984 --> 28:51.384
I'm not saying it is.

28:51.386 --> 28:54.521
I got eight people at this table

28:54.523 --> 28:57.324
who depend largely
on the NYPD

28:57.326 --> 29:00.360
for every roof, meal
and pair of shoes they ever had,

29:00.362 --> 29:03.229
and I can't get
one of you to recognize

29:03.231 --> 29:05.698
that this is an insult
to that institution?

29:07.168 --> 29:08.635
I'll be with you
if you want.

29:08.637 --> 29:10.170
Me, too.
FRANK: Well,

29:10.172 --> 29:11.738
thank you, boys.

29:11.740 --> 29:14.641
I hate to say it
and I can't believe I am,

29:14.643 --> 29:17.610
but you're thinking
like a politician here.

29:17.612 --> 29:19.879
I would never do that.

29:19.881 --> 29:22.849
You're looking at it
one way only,

29:22.851 --> 29:25.485
namely, how it reflects on you.

29:30.658 --> 29:31.958
Okay.

29:34.328 --> 29:35.795
We've only been looking
at this one way,

29:35.797 --> 29:38.264
that it's connected to a case
that Kleiner presided over.

29:38.266 --> 29:39.532
But what if
it isn't?

29:39.534 --> 29:42.035
But we've already gone over
all the trial records,

29:42.037 --> 29:43.136
over and over.

29:43.138 --> 29:45.171
The trial records,
but not the civil cases

29:45.173 --> 29:47.173
where he testified
as an expert witness.

29:47.175 --> 29:48.875
Leon...
Detectives.

29:48.877 --> 29:50.276
How many transcripts
we looking at?

29:50.278 --> 29:51.844
Dozens.
Great.

29:51.846 --> 29:54.280
Judge Kleiner served on
the board of three hospitals

29:54.282 --> 29:57.049
as an expert in medical
malpractice cases.

29:57.051 --> 30:00.052
His parents were both doctors.

30:00.054 --> 30:02.254
It was a legacy
close to his heart.

30:02.256 --> 30:04.957
Right. So what we're looking for
is a single case

30:04.959 --> 30:07.259
where all three victims put
their left hand on the Bible,

30:07.261 --> 30:08.761
put their right
hand up in the air,

30:08.763 --> 30:10.162
stated
their name

30:10.164 --> 30:11.430
and testified under oath.

30:11.432 --> 30:12.432
So let's get started.

30:12.433 --> 30:13.632
Mmm.

30:19.973 --> 30:21.540
ERIN: The police are
doing a big push

30:21.542 --> 30:22.775
to locate your brother.

30:22.777 --> 30:23.709
I hope they find him.

30:23.711 --> 30:25.544
But what I'm asking of you

30:25.546 --> 30:26.745
does not hinge on their success.

30:26.747 --> 30:28.314
It sure does.

30:28.316 --> 30:31.050
You and your brother
got yourselves into this mess.

30:32.218 --> 30:34.587
I am offering you
your only way out.

30:36.456 --> 30:38.290
You are going to testify

30:38.292 --> 30:39.658
against Winslow Martin
in the morning.

30:39.660 --> 30:41.994
We are not going to cave in
to his tactics.

30:41.996 --> 30:43.028
I can't.

30:43.030 --> 30:44.596
I thought you wanted

30:44.598 --> 30:45.898
to be an attorney.

30:45.900 --> 30:48.967
What do you think
is going to happen here?

30:48.969 --> 30:50.202
I'll find a way.

30:50.204 --> 30:51.870
You'll find a way?

30:53.373 --> 30:54.873
Listen to me.

30:54.875 --> 30:58.610
The jailhouse lawyer
success story is a myth.

30:58.612 --> 31:00.646
You will just be
another loser

31:00.648 --> 31:02.147
spending her best years
behind bars,

31:02.149 --> 31:03.548
and when you get out,

31:03.550 --> 31:06.051
you will be carrying a felony
conviction around with you

31:06.053 --> 31:07.719
for the rest of your life.

31:07.721 --> 31:09.922
(stifles a sob)

31:15.962 --> 31:18.697
I will either see you
in the morning

31:18.699 --> 31:20.399
or I will see you
at your own trial,

31:20.401 --> 31:21.967
where I will bury you.

31:23.669 --> 31:25.937
What's it going to be?

31:31.110 --> 31:33.011
Gate.
(gate buzzes)

31:35.281 --> 31:36.781
I'll testify.

31:46.158 --> 31:47.325
Nothing here.

31:47.327 --> 31:49.561
I don't care if it takes
all night. Keep looking.

31:52.898 --> 31:53.865
Trifecta!

31:53.867 --> 31:55.366
You got it?

31:55.368 --> 31:57.735
Feinberg, Kleiner and Greenwald

31:57.737 --> 31:59.237
all testified for the defense

31:59.239 --> 32:02.373
in <i> Arthur Kent Whitmore v.</i>
<i>St. Benjamin's Hospital Center.</i>

32:02.375 --> 32:03.908
That was about a year back.

32:03.910 --> 32:05.710
Guy's wife contracted sepsis

32:05.712 --> 32:08.112
and died while in for
a kidney transplant.

32:08.114 --> 32:10.214
He lost the malpractice suit

32:10.216 --> 32:12.317
but brought a civil suit
for $20 million.

32:12.319 --> 32:13.151
What'd he get from them?

32:13.153 --> 32:14.252
Legal fees.

32:14.254 --> 32:15.820
No cash settlement. Zip.

32:15.822 --> 32:16.888
That would've pissed me off.

32:16.890 --> 32:18.523
Anyone else testify
for the hospital?

32:19.691 --> 32:20.725
There was a nurse.

32:20.727 --> 32:22.794
Leslie Caitlyn O'Rourke.

32:22.796 --> 32:24.295
Leslie Caitlyn O'Rourke...

32:24.297 --> 32:25.396
Yeah, she was
the jury's favorite.

32:25.398 --> 32:26.631
Absolutely bulletproof.

32:26.633 --> 32:29.066
Well, we'd better make sure
she stays that way.

32:29.068 --> 32:30.268
Let's go.

32:40.272 --> 32:42.206
Go ahead.
Wait, say again?

32:42.208 --> 32:44.809
A red, white and black
Hypermotard.

32:44.811 --> 32:45.743
That's the bike?

32:45.745 --> 32:46.944
Okay, has anyone
seen him tonight?

32:46.946 --> 32:48.379
For when?

32:48.381 --> 32:50.781
Sit on his apartment,
call me if he shows up. Got it.

32:50.783 --> 32:52.483
Copy that. Thanks.

32:52.485 --> 32:53.751
What do you got?

32:53.753 --> 32:55.753
Customs and border protection
have Whitmore confirmed

32:55.755 --> 32:59.490
on an Aeromexico flight to
Guadalajara tomorrow at 0800.

32:59.492 --> 33:00.958
Long time between then and now.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.159
Here we are.

33:05.864 --> 33:07.498
Talk to me.
What do you got?

33:07.500 --> 33:09.533
Doorman says she's
out walking her dog.

33:09.535 --> 33:10.934
Left about ten minutes ago.

33:10.936 --> 33:12.770
We have any description?
Late 30s, five-five

33:12.772 --> 33:14.505
or so, blonde.
She's wearing jeans

33:14.507 --> 33:16.540
and a college hoodie
underneath her jacket.

33:16.542 --> 33:17.808
She's walking her beagle.

33:17.810 --> 33:19.410
All right, we're gonna
need to spread out, okay?

33:19.412 --> 33:22.112
You and your partner take the
avenues, head north and south.

33:22.114 --> 33:23.847
We'll take the cross streets.
We're looking for a male,

33:23.849 --> 33:25.782
white, around 48 years old,
he's riding

33:25.784 --> 33:27.184
a red, black and white
motorcycle.

33:27.186 --> 33:28.285
And, yes, he's
armed and dangerous.

33:28.287 --> 33:29.920
So be careful, all right?
Come on.

33:29.922 --> 33:33.156
Joey, let's roll!
Spread out, partner.

33:35.994 --> 33:38.195
(indistinct chatter nearby)

34:07.758 --> 34:09.426
(gun clicking)

34:21.272 --> 34:23.139
Baez? Hey.

34:23.141 --> 34:24.974
You got anything?

34:26.643 --> 34:29.846
Hold on.

34:29.848 --> 34:33.081
False alarm.

34:33.083 --> 34:35.284
All right.

34:42.826 --> 34:45.928
(indistinct chatter nearby)

34:56.039 --> 34:59.642
You know it.
That's what I'm talking about.

34:59.644 --> 35:01.677
Please, pass it over here, son.

35:01.679 --> 35:03.813
(indistinct chatter continues)

35:06.717 --> 35:09.485
Yo...

35:20.631 --> 35:21.597
(line ringing)

35:21.599 --> 35:22.732
OPERATOR:
911?

35:22.734 --> 35:24.867
Hi, I'm at the Jefferson Avenue

35:24.869 --> 35:26.869
Housing Projects
on Dwyer Avenue.

35:26.871 --> 35:28.838
A young man who mugged me
last week is there.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.741
He's, uh, on the corner
of Dwyer and Horton.

35:31.743 --> 35:34.610
He's about 20,
he's five-eight,

35:34.612 --> 35:36.979
wearing jeans and a red hoodie.

35:36.981 --> 35:38.414
Could you send an RMP, please?

35:38.416 --> 35:40.916
What's your name, please?

35:40.918 --> 35:43.152
My name is Linda Reagan.

36:00.804 --> 36:03.305
(gunshot)

36:03.307 --> 36:04.406
(woman screaming)
Watch out!

36:04.408 --> 36:06.008
Move it! Move!

36:06.743 --> 36:08.310
Come on!

36:13.917 --> 36:15.384
Watch out!

36:15.386 --> 36:17.019
(gunshot)

36:23.927 --> 36:25.594
(groaning)

36:25.596 --> 36:26.828
Don't move.

36:26.830 --> 36:29.665
(grunting)
Shut up. Shut up!

36:34.003 --> 36:36.371
You Arthur Kent Whitmore?

36:36.373 --> 36:38.874
I said are you
Arthur Kent Whitmore?!

36:38.876 --> 36:40.275
Yeah.

36:40.277 --> 36:42.511
Good, you're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

36:42.513 --> 36:43.513
You okay?

36:43.514 --> 36:44.613
Yeah. I didn't shoot him.

36:44.615 --> 36:45.680
Keep an eye on him.

36:45.682 --> 36:47.415
Yeah.

36:48.851 --> 36:49.851
Police.

36:49.853 --> 36:52.721
Where'd those shots come from?

36:54.390 --> 36:56.057
Ma'am, put the gun
on the ground.

36:56.059 --> 36:58.259
Put the gun on the ground.

36:58.261 --> 37:00.462
And step back.

37:01.997 --> 37:04.566
Leslie Caitlyn O'Rourke?

37:04.568 --> 37:05.900
Yes.

37:05.902 --> 37:07.102
Detective Reagan.

37:07.104 --> 37:08.370
You shoot him?

37:08.372 --> 37:09.437
Yes.

37:09.439 --> 37:11.072
He called my name, I turned.

37:11.074 --> 37:12.674
He had a gun.

37:12.676 --> 37:14.209
I pulled out my gun
and shot and missed.

37:14.211 --> 37:15.677
He kept going
and turned to shoot.

37:15.679 --> 37:17.045
But I shot him first.

37:19.381 --> 37:20.615
You got a permit for the gun?

37:20.617 --> 37:22.817
Yes, I do.

37:28.757 --> 37:30.558
You're a nurse?

37:30.560 --> 37:32.060
Yes.

37:32.062 --> 37:33.594
And you carry a gun?

37:33.596 --> 37:34.629
Detective,

37:34.631 --> 37:35.830
I'm a female who's worked

37:35.832 --> 37:36.964
at New York City hospitals

37:36.966 --> 37:38.599
for almost 20 years.

37:38.601 --> 37:40.635
I've seen what comes in
and how they got there.

37:42.070 --> 37:44.806
Right.

37:44.808 --> 37:47.108
Step on the sidewalk, okay?

37:47.110 --> 37:49.010
Go on.

37:56.785 --> 37:58.586
All right, Einstein, you ready
to make some electricity?

37:58.588 --> 37:59.620
I think I got it.

37:59.622 --> 38:01.389
Here, watch, watch your brother.
Ready?

38:01.391 --> 38:02.990
Got it.
Yes!

38:02.992 --> 38:04.325
Yeah!

38:04.327 --> 38:06.227
DANNY: You do the Christmas tree
this year, okay?

38:06.229 --> 38:07.229
(Jack laughs)

38:07.230 --> 38:09.497
Hey, Mom.
Hey, Mom.

38:09.499 --> 38:10.531
Hi.

38:10.533 --> 38:12.333
Hi, guys.

38:12.335 --> 38:13.768
Looking good.

38:13.770 --> 38:14.935
Thank you.

38:14.937 --> 38:16.670
You think you could
give me and your dad

38:16.672 --> 38:18.572
a minute... alone?

38:18.574 --> 38:20.141
But this is homework.
Great.

38:20.143 --> 38:22.643
Then don't look
a gift horse in the mouth, huh?

38:22.645 --> 38:24.011
Listen to your mom.

38:32.053 --> 38:33.253
Where you been?

38:33.255 --> 38:35.823
I took another shift
at the mobile hospital.

38:35.825 --> 38:37.358
I told you about that.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.527
Just thought
you'd be done by 9:00.

38:41.863 --> 38:44.398
Texted you about 30 times.

38:44.400 --> 38:46.333
I had other business.

38:53.942 --> 38:55.509
I saw the mugger again.

38:55.511 --> 38:58.278
I called 911.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.414
And they got him.

39:00.416 --> 39:02.049
Wow.

39:02.051 --> 39:04.751
But I'm not gonna get my
grandma's necklace back until,

39:04.753 --> 39:06.687
uh, it's not evidence anymore.

39:06.689 --> 39:09.323
Right.

39:10.758 --> 39:12.159
Well, we got our guy, too.

39:12.161 --> 39:13.894
Good.

39:13.896 --> 39:17.698
He was going after a nurse.

39:17.700 --> 39:19.933
Hmm.

39:19.935 --> 39:22.836
She was carrying
and had a license.

39:22.838 --> 39:25.872
She told me she'd be
a fool not to carry.

39:25.874 --> 39:27.440
Jamie talk to you?

39:27.442 --> 39:28.742
About what?

39:28.744 --> 39:30.844
Danny?

39:30.846 --> 39:33.013
I don't know what you're
talking about, Linda.

39:44.692 --> 39:46.893
It's not loaded.
It's, it's...

39:50.965 --> 39:53.399
(quiet laugh)

39:53.401 --> 39:55.735
Yeah, I stood there
talking to this nurse,

39:55.737 --> 39:57.837
and... she's blonde,

39:57.839 --> 40:00.073
about your height,

40:00.075 --> 40:01.407
pretty-- not as pretty as you

40:01.409 --> 40:04.844
but pretty.

40:04.846 --> 40:08.848
The whole time I was talking
to her, I just kept thinking,

40:08.850 --> 40:10.416
Linda got a gun.

40:10.418 --> 40:12.618
(laughs)
You're making this up.

40:12.620 --> 40:14.754
I swear to you I'm not.

40:17.424 --> 40:19.592
I don't want it.

40:29.703 --> 40:31.771
It's not for me.

40:31.773 --> 40:35.341
Okay.

40:37.511 --> 40:39.278
What I do want is

40:39.280 --> 40:42.114
for you never
to disrespect me again.

40:44.384 --> 40:48.054
To be proud of me.

40:48.056 --> 40:50.289
Like I am of you.

40:52.993 --> 40:55.227
Can you do that?

41:04.337 --> 41:06.605
I can do that.

41:08.975 --> 41:11.176
(indistinct chatter)

41:17.917 --> 41:20.653
Let me call you right back.

41:20.655 --> 41:22.821
Maybe I should just take
the door off the hinges.

41:22.823 --> 41:24.156
Save the wear and tear.

41:24.158 --> 41:27.393
I'm thinking we should
make a statement.

41:27.395 --> 41:29.394
In response to Donald Stein's

41:29.396 --> 41:31.730
ad in the <i> Times.</i>

41:31.732 --> 41:33.031
An “I told you so”?

41:33.033 --> 41:34.500
Not a good idea.

41:34.502 --> 41:37.236
No, not an “I told you so”"

41:37.238 --> 41:38.804
You were right--
they weren't hate crimes.

41:38.806 --> 41:40.005
Why rub it in?

41:40.007 --> 41:42.341
I'm thinking more
like a thank you note.

41:42.343 --> 41:43.942
For?

41:43.944 --> 41:45.944
Stepping up.

41:45.946 --> 41:47.646
With a private security force?

41:47.648 --> 41:49.548
In the face of the police
commissioner's assurance

41:49.550 --> 41:53.285
that this department had all the
resources that were necessary?

41:53.287 --> 41:56.288
History is rife with good
people exercising their right

41:56.290 --> 41:58.790
to take measures
in their defense

41:58.792 --> 42:01.927
despite the authorities' wishes.

42:01.929 --> 42:04.930
Taking the long view today?

42:04.932 --> 42:08.433
My mom never left the house

42:08.435 --> 42:10.468
without a pound of pennies

42:10.470 --> 42:13.371
in a tube sock in her purse.

42:13.373 --> 42:16.041
Okay.

42:16.043 --> 42:18.877
Fact is, I let my ego

42:18.879 --> 42:21.313
cloud my judgment.

42:21.315 --> 42:22.947
Could you write something up?

42:22.949 --> 42:26.751
That Frank Reagan let his ego
cloud his judgment?

42:26.753 --> 42:28.787
Well, not in those words.

42:28.789 --> 42:30.688
In yours.

42:30.690 --> 42:34.325
Tell you what.

42:34.327 --> 42:37.061
Why don't you just,
next time you see him,

42:37.063 --> 42:40.732
share this sentiment
with Donald Stein personally.

42:40.734 --> 42:42.767
Keep it in-house,

42:42.769 --> 42:46.037
so to speak.

42:46.039 --> 42:47.372
You think?

42:47.374 --> 42:50.475
I do.

42:50.477 --> 42:54.212
We'll do it your way.

42:54.214 --> 42:56.648
Okay.

42:56.650 --> 42:58.016
Good talk.

42:58.018 --> 42:59.117
Open or closed?

42:59.119 --> 43:01.352
Closed, thank you.
