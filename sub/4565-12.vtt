WEBVTT

00:06.439 --> 00:08.841
Why didn't you wake me?

00:10.176 --> 00:11.944
It's electives day.
The earlier we sign up,

00:11.946 --> 00:14.246
The better the chance we have
of getting all the good ones.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.382
I tried to wake you up
three times.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.917
You know I don't think
you're serious until six times.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.185
You know the first
three times

00:20.187 --> 00:22.221
I'm still checking
for chicken pox

00:22.223 --> 00:23.622
To see if I can
miss school.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.725
Hey, I tickled your toes.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.762
Well, that explains
the lucas dream.

00:29.764 --> 00:31.964
So, what electives
are we hoping for?

00:31.966 --> 00:33.632
We are hoping
to get out of them.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.434
Actually, it's not
gonna happen, sister.

00:35.436 --> 00:36.902
These are
service electives.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.637
Not only do they expect
us to be students,

00:38.639 --> 00:41.373
But now they want
to give us jobs.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.276
How are we supposed
to work and go to school
at the same time?

00:44.278 --> 00:44.977
Yeah, who does that?

00:44.979 --> 00:46.445
How you doin'?

00:46.447 --> 00:48.647
Oh, hey, honey.

00:48.649 --> 00:49.848
Where you going?

00:49.850 --> 00:51.283
I'm going to school.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.384
Oh, whatcha gonna do there?

00:52.386 --> 00:53.619
I'm gonna work.

00:53.621 --> 00:55.888
Wait, you're gonna
go to work and school?

00:55.890 --> 00:57.823
At the same time.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.526
Topanga:
Wait but, just for
a couple of days, right?

01:00.528 --> 01:02.561
No, no, no.
This is forever.

01:02.563 --> 01:06.698
But topanga, surely
your responsibilities
are temporary, right?

01:06.700 --> 01:10.769
Oh, no. I have to do
everything all the time.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.440
Bravo!

01:14.442 --> 01:16.408
No more.
No more.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.476
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:17.478 --> 01:18.710
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.946
We will be here for
the rest of your lives.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.248
Have a good day, honey.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.750
I hate parent theater.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.019
Yeah, we did set
them up pretty good.

01:27.021 --> 01:28.887
You know, when I
went to law school,

01:28.889 --> 01:30.956
I held down two
part-time jobs.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.758
Yeah, but now your life
is a piece of cake.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.026
Would you make us cake?

01:34.028 --> 01:35.294
Get to school.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.895
You'll be here,
making cake?

01:36.897 --> 01:38.564
( chuckles )
hey, riley,

01:38.566 --> 01:39.932
You can put your dishes
in the dishwasher.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.500
Later, mom. I promise.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.368
Job and school.
Job and school.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.937
Uh, you could at least
put them on the--

01:44.939 --> 01:45.938
( door closes )

01:45.940 --> 01:47.339
Counter.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.807
Okay, fine.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.609
I can finally go to work.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.611
Am I forgetting anything?

01:53.813 --> 01:54.980
Okay.

01:57.684 --> 01:59.685
I have another kid.

01:59.687 --> 02:02.121
( sighs )
why did I do that?

02:02.123 --> 02:04.289
( laughs )
auggie, baby!

02:04.291 --> 02:05.290

Who here knows about
the great depression?

03:01.849 --> 03:04.850
I thought it was called
the grand canyon?

03:08.121 --> 03:09.955
Who here knows about
the great depression?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.390
Maya?

03:11.392 --> 03:14.026
Nothing's gonna
beat that, sir.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.828
Farkle,
save me.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.897
The year was 1929,

03:18.899 --> 03:20.699
The stock market crashed,

03:20.701 --> 03:22.868
Everyone lost their money
and their jobs.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.070
And the people who
were comfortable were now lost

03:25.072 --> 03:26.104
And became known as...

03:26.106 --> 03:27.739
"the forgotten."

03:27.741 --> 03:29.641
Working class people,

03:29.643 --> 03:32.044
The heart and soul
of our country,

03:32.046 --> 03:34.680
Basically taken for granted
in the first place,

03:34.682 --> 03:37.849
And now, discarded
and forgotten.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.818
How could that happen, sir?

03:39.820 --> 03:45.023
But that could never happen
to anyone in the grand canyon
today, could it?

03:47.126 --> 03:49.127
I don't know, riley.

03:49.129 --> 03:52.097
I'm sure you would never
take anyone for granted, right?

03:52.099 --> 03:54.066
I would never.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.535
And do you think there's anyone
who cares about you who goes

03:56.537 --> 03:58.837
Underappreciated
or overlooked?

03:58.839 --> 04:01.039
Maya,

04:01.041 --> 04:04.643
My life is so much better
for having you in it.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.079
I know, pumpkin.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.614
Thank you, dad.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.749
For the first time,
I've actually understood

04:10.751 --> 04:12.751
Something that you've
tried to teach me.

04:12.753 --> 04:16.521
Please, bell, ring.

04:16.523 --> 04:17.623
Ring!

04:17.625 --> 04:18.991
Ah-ha.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.131
You could do that?

04:31.638 --> 04:33.105
I wonder what electives
we're gonna get.

04:33.107 --> 04:36.808
Why do they call them
"electives" if they
make us do them?

04:36.810 --> 04:37.943
I don't know.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.112
And why do they call it
shop class?

04:40.114 --> 04:42.848
That was the biggest
disappointment of my
little life.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.155
Yum, blob.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.093
Not because it's not good,
only because there's no taste

04:55.095 --> 04:56.161
And no flavor.

04:57.997 --> 04:59.131
Okay.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.732
You know I made that myself.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.733
What is it?

05:01.735 --> 05:04.002
I call it, "Tuesday."

05:04.004 --> 05:05.070
But it's Thursday.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.571
Mm-hmm.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.707
No throwing rolls!

05:08.709 --> 05:10.242
Well, she's in
a good mood today.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.710
That's the happiest
I've seen her.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.845
Look, I don't care
what electives we get,

05:13.847 --> 05:14.980
Just as long as we don't
end up in--

05:14.982 --> 05:16.882
Dun-dun-dun!

05:16.884 --> 05:17.983
Cafeteria duty.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.151
( both shudder )

05:19.153 --> 05:21.186
Good afternoon, geralyn.

05:21.188 --> 05:23.221
Oh, mashed potatoes.

05:23.223 --> 05:26.224
I put a little extra love
in there for you today.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.759
I know you did.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.729
No eating in line, matthews.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.098
Oh, you're tough.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.834
I sure wouldn't want to be
one of the kids who gets you
for an elective.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.903
( laughing )

05:42.175 --> 05:44.743
Do you guys ever
actually eat the food?

05:44.745 --> 05:45.844
All:
No.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.249
Hey, how do you guys
actually make this thing erupt?

05:51.251 --> 05:53.285
Maya, don't!

05:53.287 --> 05:55.554
She's gonna blow!

06:05.965 --> 06:08.800
Why do they build
their villages so close?

06:08.802 --> 06:11.069
Why?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.138
( bell rings )

06:15.908 --> 06:17.109
Hey, hey, hey.

06:17.111 --> 06:19.244
Where are you guys going?
What's the rush?

06:19.246 --> 06:22.247
Geralyn, janitor harley,
can you come over here
for a minute?

06:25.051 --> 06:28.153
So, you guys don't think
you should have to clean
any of this up?

06:29.155 --> 06:31.022
Geralyn, do you think
they realize when they

06:31.024 --> 06:32.758
Waste their food like this
it makes you feel bad?

06:32.760 --> 06:33.892
I feel bad.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.662
Do you think they realize
when they make a mess

06:37.664 --> 06:39.264
In the cafeteria,
it makes you feel bad?

06:39.266 --> 06:42.134
I actually feel
I deserve what I get.

06:42.136 --> 06:45.203
But I have all kinds
of different issues.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.908
You know, in just a few minutes
you guys played with your food

06:49.910 --> 06:53.078
And you left a mess
without any regard or respect
for anyone else.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.045
It's not just us.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.113
I know.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.715
And you're the good ones.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.184
I'm gonna go ahead and assign
you your electives now.

06:59.186 --> 07:03.221
Girls, your electives will be,
and I don't think anybody

07:03.223 --> 07:04.689
Saw this one coming.

07:04.691 --> 07:07.125
Oh, no.

07:07.127 --> 07:07.893
Cafeteria duty.

07:11.230 --> 07:14.065
How you doin'?

07:14.067 --> 07:16.001
I've been better.

07:18.037 --> 07:19.171
Wow.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.006
That's the worst elective
in the school

07:21.008 --> 07:23.074
Besides janitorial services.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.679
Oh.

07:28.714 --> 07:31.082
How you doin',
boys I own?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.951
Meet mr. Mop.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.120
And his pal,
mr. Bucket.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.122
First,

07:37.124 --> 07:40.025
You'll clean mr. Mess
in the cafeteria.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.860
Then I'll introduce you

07:41.862 --> 07:44.796
To the always delightful
mr. Vomit.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.798
Thank you, but I have
enough friends.

07:54.273 --> 07:55.807
Hey, pretty lunch lady.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.943
You are killing
this thang.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.278
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

08:01.347 --> 08:02.814
What about me?

08:02.816 --> 08:04.883
Am I not the cutest thing ever?

08:17.830 --> 08:20.866
Actually, these are being worn
on the back of the head
this season.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.969
I have my own
distinct sense of fashion!

08:25.338 --> 08:26.872
Welcome...

08:26.874 --> 08:28.373
To the cafeteria.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.108
We have a lot of fun here.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.410
And by fun, I mean potatoes.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.846
And by potatoes,

08:34.848 --> 08:36.448
I mean, we peel them.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.984
And by we,
I mean you.

08:40.786 --> 08:43.121
Well, this actually
doesn't seem so bad.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.356
There's more,
aren't there?

08:44.358 --> 08:45.857
Look behind you,
scarecrow.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.359
Oh, I have a nickname.

08:47.361 --> 08:50.128
That's a lot of potatoes.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.198
When you have completed
the peeling of the potato,

08:53.200 --> 08:55.734
You place the potato
in the pot.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.769
That is all you do.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.137
Now,

08:59.139 --> 09:01.172
I will finish preparing
tomorrow's lunch.

09:01.174 --> 09:04.175
You ladies will do what?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.944
- Peel the potatoes.
- Put them in the pot.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.112
What do you do?

09:07.114 --> 09:08.947
- Peel the potatoes.
- Put them in the pot.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.849
What do you not do?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.150
Anything else.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.920
I believe
we have communicated.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.188
Except for one thing.

09:17.190 --> 09:21.459
This is a one-week class
for you, a grade.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.461
But this is my world
and I care very much

09:23.463 --> 09:25.130
About what happens back here.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.431
Understand?

09:26.433 --> 09:27.832
Yes, ms.--

09:27.834 --> 09:28.867
Thompson.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.001
Thompson.
Sorry.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.169
We should have
known that.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.270
Mm-hmm.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.738
My name is--

09:33.740 --> 09:36.441
Riley matthews.
Loves fish stick fridays.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.442

09:37.444 --> 09:38.877

09:38.879 --> 09:40.779
I always give you extra
to take home.

09:42.014 --> 09:44.215
I know all my kids.

09:44.217 --> 09:47.252
Well, I will leave
you ladies to it.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.424
So, this is easy.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.059
What could possibly go wrong?

09:54.061 --> 09:55.760
Look at all these spices.

09:56.495 --> 09:57.796
You know what these are?

09:57.798 --> 09:58.396
What?

09:58.398 --> 09:59.798
Taste and flavor.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.132
The kids will love us.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.034
Peel the potatoes,
put them in the pot.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.170

I can't hear you.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.078
I don't understand
any of this.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.046
Yeah, I never think
of these hallways

10:15.048 --> 10:16.781
As being anything
but clean.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.283
Thank you.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.185
There are two types
of custodians:

10:20.187 --> 10:22.954
The ninja, and the showboat.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.423
I, janitor harley keiner,

10:25.425 --> 10:26.858
Am a ninja.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.928
Me, you never see coming.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.997
You just know I've been there.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.101
( sighs )
how much throw-up can there
possibly be in a school?

10:36.103 --> 10:40.972
Well, each student has a stomach
about yea big.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.042
Yet they think they can eat
about yea much.

10:45.044 --> 10:47.012
<i>( vomiting )</i>

10:47.014 --> 10:49.180
Alvin bergis.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.416
You can actually tell
who that is?

10:51.418 --> 10:53.151
I know all of you.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.120
Alvin's a seventh grader.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.988
He has a speech
in english today.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.123
He seems...

10:58.125 --> 10:59.290
<i>( alvin continues vomiting )</i>

10:59.292 --> 11:00.392
...Unprepared.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.498
I got this.

11:10.269 --> 11:11.870
Does that happen a lot?

11:11.872 --> 11:14.239
Happens all the time.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.840
It's my job.

11:27.186 --> 11:29.421
( scoffs )
oh, hey girls.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.623
Would you like to help me
with the groceries, please?

11:31.625 --> 11:33.892
We worked all day
for 45 minutes.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.164
Could you rub my back?

11:39.166 --> 11:40.432
Oh, sure maya.

11:40.434 --> 11:43.568
Just right after I bring in
all the rest of the groceries

11:43.570 --> 11:45.970
By myself and then cook dinner
for the entire family.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.505
Okay, hurry up.

11:50.042 --> 11:53.378
Riley, I asked you to clear off
the table this morning.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.381
Mom, you are not being
very sympathetic to us.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.649
We worked.

11:57.651 --> 11:58.950
In a kitchen.

11:58.952 --> 11:59.951
45 minutes.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.553
In a row.

12:03.189 --> 12:04.189
Rub my back.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.192
When you do it, it's like
spiders poking at me.

12:07.194 --> 12:08.426
But that's my spider move.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.961
Ew.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.330
( sighs )
girls, could you
please help me

12:12.332 --> 12:13.965
Bring in the rest
of the groceries?

12:13.967 --> 12:16.067
Other people had
a hard day, too.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.404
Yes, farkle and lucas
had to clean.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.638
45 minutes.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.340
In a row.

12:22.342 --> 12:26.344
Wow, I had no idea.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.379
Poor, poor kids.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.015
I'll just go get
the rest of the groceries

12:31.017 --> 12:31.983
By myself.

12:35.121 --> 12:38.089
Wow.
Maya, you know that lesson

12:38.091 --> 12:39.324
About "the forgotten"
this morning?

12:39.326 --> 12:40.458
Yeah.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.093
It's us.

12:45.231 --> 12:46.631
( sighs )

12:50.971 --> 12:54.572
The potatoes you prepared
yesterday will be served today.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.107
When do we get paid?

12:57.209 --> 12:59.210
The grateful looks
in everyone's faces

12:59.212 --> 13:01.179
Will be pay enough
for me.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.648
You want a pat on the back,
you better get a longer arm.

13:03.650 --> 13:06.518
This is not the job
for "attaboys"
or "you go girls."

13:06.520 --> 13:10.021
Yesterday was the hardest
I've worked in my life.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.256
I have no doubt of that.

13:11.258 --> 13:14.125
Now, for the actual hard part.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.194
That's a joke.

13:16.196 --> 13:20.064
When that lunch bell rings,
brace yourselves, rookies.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.633
It's about to get real in here.

13:22.601 --> 13:24.135
You're in charge
of the potatoes.

13:26.005 --> 13:28.072
You scoop them up,

13:28.074 --> 13:29.607
You plop them down.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.409
Scoop, then plop.
Say it.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.011
Scoop and plop.

13:33.013 --> 13:37.215
Now, after those plates go out,
guess what happens next.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.316
We can go home.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.752
( laughs )

13:40.754 --> 13:42.387
You can go home.
( laughs )

13:42.389 --> 13:44.155
No!

13:44.157 --> 13:46.257
Those dishes come back
with twice the fury.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.626
They come in here.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.228
You scrape.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.396
You rinse.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.365
Where they go on
their little dish journey,

13:54.367 --> 13:55.400
Where they are reborn

13:55.402 --> 13:58.002
As clean dishes
for tomorrow.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.170
Hallelujah!

13:59.172 --> 13:59.771
Say it.

13:59.773 --> 14:01.206
Hallelujah.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.240
Say it.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.108
( bell rings )

14:04.110 --> 14:05.210
This is it.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.179
How bad can
middle school lunch get?

14:09.548 --> 14:12.016
Goodbye, tiny little girls.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.218
Let's do this thing.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.219
( students screaming )

14:14.221 --> 14:16.287
( both screaming )

14:24.063 --> 14:25.029
Whoo.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.030
They have been served.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.465
- By us.
- The servers.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.534
Except no one smiled.

14:30.469 --> 14:31.803
And nobody said
"thank you."

14:31.805 --> 14:33.538
And nobody even
knew my name.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.106
And I go to school
with these people.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.141
Welcome to my world.

14:37.143 --> 14:39.043
Well, at least
the hard part is over.

14:39.045 --> 14:42.647
No, now comes the actual,
actual hard part.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.250
Why do you keep
making that same joke?

14:45.252 --> 14:47.418
Look over here.
Wait for it.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.488
Here it comes.
Wait for it.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.059
What?

14:55.061 --> 14:55.793
This is it?

14:55.795 --> 14:57.262
Oh, I got this.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.097
This is nothing.
I'll do it all.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.199
Scrape.

15:01.201 --> 15:04.135
Rinse.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.337
Hallelujah.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.206
Maya, you might as well
go home.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.307
How bad do you think
this is gonna be?

15:09.309 --> 15:11.643
That was the first
rain drop.

15:11.645 --> 15:12.710
Before what?

15:12.712 --> 15:14.779
Noah.

15:17.182 --> 15:19.584
Maya!

15:21.421 --> 15:26.724
Please tell me
there isn't another
actual, actual hard part.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.526
No, you're done.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.862
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

15:30.864 --> 15:32.830
Why don't you two
go to the locker room,

15:32.832 --> 15:34.532
Hit the showers,
and freshen up.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.833
I'm filthy.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.835
We don't want anybody
to see us like this.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.804
Well, I don't see where
you have any other choice.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.607
There is.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.375
There is another way.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.183
Geralyn:
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:52.185 --> 15:53.418
As curious as I am,

15:53.420 --> 15:55.219
To see what would
happen to you,

15:55.221 --> 15:56.554
I've grown to like
you both.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.657
I'm very proud of you.

15:59.659 --> 16:03.261
You did me and my kitchen
proud today.

16:03.263 --> 16:06.664
So...

16:06.666 --> 16:08.399
No.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.809
Thank you, ms. Thompson.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.877
I think you two
can call me geralyn.

16:22.614 --> 16:24.449
( chuckles )
you guys are a mess.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.317
Lucas:
We got the school
so clean yesterday.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.252
Today was
the easiest day ever.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.321
And janitor harley said
it was the least pukey day

16:30.323 --> 16:31.456
He's ever seen.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.791
Wait a minute, boys.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.760
What's the matter?

16:35.762 --> 16:37.228
There's a storm
a-brewin'.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.830
What kind of storm?

16:38.832 --> 16:41.499
<i>- ( vomiting )</i>
<i>- </i> we're too late!

16:41.501 --> 16:43.201
Oh, my.
Farkle, run!

16:43.203 --> 16:44.235
I am running!

16:44.237 --> 16:45.336
I'm just not
a good athlete.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.238
Save yourselves.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.539
They're all
about to blow.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.448
All you had to do
was peel the potatoes

16:57.450 --> 16:58.449
And put them
in the pot.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.617
That's what I did.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.752
Peel the potatoes!

17:00.754 --> 17:02.420
Put them in the pot.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.724
Funny story.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.698
Whoa.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.201
Yeah.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.304
Geralyn is really good
at her job.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.707
We are not good
at geralyn's job.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.876
Yeah.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.944
Whoa.

17:30.349 --> 17:32.984
In 1929, our country
fell apart.

17:32.986 --> 17:35.420
Not only because
the economy suffered,

17:35.422 --> 17:38.289
But because we neglected
the working class people

17:38.291 --> 17:39.957
Who served us with
pride and dignity.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.727
And because we never cared
enough to get to know them,

17:42.729 --> 17:44.295
They were easily
taken for granted

17:44.297 --> 17:45.596
And became
"the forgotten."

17:46.532 --> 17:48.332
Can anybody tell us
who this is?

17:48.334 --> 17:49.700
The lunchroom lady.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.002
I think she has a name.

17:51.004 --> 17:52.370
I do.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.571
Three taco sara.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.974
This is geralyn thompson.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.477
And she knows
all of your names.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.746
<i>She's worked at this school</i>
<i>for 20 years,</i>

18:01.748 --> 18:04.282
And I can tell you
that her job is not easy.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.584
Because she has
over 1,000 children

18:06.586 --> 18:08.319
And when you feed
1,000 children,

18:08.321 --> 18:09.754
You have to make sure
it's something that

18:09.756 --> 18:11.255
Everybody can eat.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.290
And even if she would like

18:12.292 --> 18:13.558
To spice things up a bit,

18:13.560 --> 18:14.892
She knows not to.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.828
Because it's what's right
for everyone.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.729
She takes pride
in her work,

18:18.731 --> 18:20.431
<i>Her kitchen,</i>
<i>her cooking,</i>

18:20.433 --> 18:21.933
And us.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.402
And I'm proud that I was able
to stand in her shoes for a day.

18:24.404 --> 18:25.736
This lady right here

18:25.738 --> 18:26.871
Does it everyday...

18:26.873 --> 18:27.805
For us.

18:27.807 --> 18:28.940
Geralyn.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.675
Remember that name.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.543
Whatever we end up
doing in life,

18:32.545 --> 18:33.945
We have to do it
with the same pride

18:33.947 --> 18:35.746
And enthusiasm as her.

18:36.682 --> 18:37.715
Boys.

18:37.717 --> 18:38.950
We've seen things.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.585
You don't know, man.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.520
You weren't there.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.822
They went in as boys,

18:44.824 --> 18:47.925
They came out as
I don't know.

18:47.927 --> 18:51.062
I don't know
what they are now.

18:51.064 --> 18:52.930
We'd be lying to you
if we told you

18:52.932 --> 18:55.032
Janitorial services
was our first pick.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.969
But I wouldn't trade
this experience for
a trip to the moon.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.570
That was an elective?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.040
Janitor harley is
a good man.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.809
You have no idea what
he goes through for you.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.544
You may not even notice
that he's there.

19:06.546 --> 19:07.912
But I promise you this,

19:07.914 --> 19:09.614
You would notice
if he wasn't there.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.982
The clean tables,

19:10.984 --> 19:13.084
The immaculate classrooms,

19:13.086 --> 19:14.585
The shiny floors;

19:14.587 --> 19:15.953
They don't magically happen.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.022
They take a ninja.

19:19.558 --> 19:20.858
Ninja.

19:22.961 --> 19:25.796
People who go
through things for you,

19:25.798 --> 19:29.066
People who pour their heart
and souls into their jobs

19:29.068 --> 19:32.937
Because they care
should be valued and embraced.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.772
You should look them in the eye

19:34.774 --> 19:36.040
And say "thank you."

19:37.342 --> 19:38.609
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.947
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.749
( scoffs )

19:44.751 --> 19:47.051
I appreciate that.
( giggles )

20:00.832 --> 20:02.366
Thank you.

20:04.970 --> 20:08.039
I peeled potatoes for one day
and I almost died.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.042
I love you.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.643
I love you, too.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.416
Ooh!

20:18.418 --> 20:20.084
Spiders.

20:21.086 --> 20:22.687
What is this for?

20:22.689 --> 20:24.422
I get up in the morning,

20:24.424 --> 20:25.723
You're already up.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.659
I go to sleep,
you're still up.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.528
There's food on the table,

20:30.530 --> 20:31.896
Clean clothes.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.065
You take us where
we need to go.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.000
You have a job and you
still make time

20:36.002 --> 20:37.702
To take care of
me and auggie.

20:37.704 --> 20:38.970
And I know now,

20:38.972 --> 20:42.873
So, if I've forgotten
to say thank you,

20:42.875 --> 20:44.976
I'm saying it now.

20:44.978 --> 20:46.544
Thank you.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.613
Oh.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.083
Oh, and you too, dad.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.084
Oh.

20:59.057 --> 21:00.725
Thank you.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.059
How are you today, geralyn?

21:02.061 --> 21:04.195
I'm fine, riley.
Thanks for asking.

21:06.898 --> 21:08.499
All:
Stop it.

21:08.501 --> 21:09.834
( laughs )

21:15.440 --> 21:16.707
I got this.

21:16.709 --> 21:17.942
No.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.043
We got this.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.917
Hey, you missed.

21:38.030 --> 21:40.965
You know, it's a funny thing
about teachers,

21:40.967 --> 21:45.069
People don't often realize
that without the lesson,

21:45.071 --> 21:46.871
Without the education,

21:46.873 --> 21:48.773
No one would learn
anything at all.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.775
<i>There would be no growth,</i>

21:50.777 --> 21:51.942
<i>No progress.</i>

21:51.944 --> 21:53.911
There would be
no doctors, or lawyers,

21:53.913 --> 21:55.546
Or anything at all, really.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.048
In fact, when you
think about it,

21:57.050 --> 21:59.050
Teachers are the foundation
of our whole country--

21:59.052 --> 22:00.851
Our whole world.

22:00.853 --> 22:04.221
Teachers should be appreciated
and never forgotten.

22:09.127 --> 22:10.995
I appreciate you, baboon.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.998
Now, get out of here so I can
go home.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.566
Yeah, okay.
