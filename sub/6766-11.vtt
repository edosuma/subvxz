WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:04.967
Okay, I understand,
but could you please

00:05.005 --> 00:07.496
take a message for Joe?

00:07.540 --> 00:09.838
Who is this?

00:09.876 --> 00:12.436
Is Tiny around?

00:12.479 --> 00:14.811
Well, can I speak to him?

00:14.848 --> 00:16.076
You know what? Never mind.

00:16.116 --> 00:17.208
Thanks for nothing.

00:18.952 --> 00:21.352
Bad phone etiquette
at the jock house?

00:21.388 --> 00:23.948
Either that
or Joe's avoiding me.

00:23.990 --> 00:25.685
Don, it's homecoming week.

00:25.725 --> 00:28.819
It's got to be, you know, like
a totally insane time for Joe

00:28.862 --> 00:30.523
with the game on
Saturday and everything.

00:30.563 --> 00:31.552
Yeah, I know.

00:31.598 --> 00:32.997
But he made me
promise to call him

00:33.066 --> 00:34.328
before I left for
the Tournament House.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.164
Well, I wouldn't make
too much out of it.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.136
It's been a weird week.

00:38.171 --> 00:39.138
That's for sure.

00:39.172 --> 00:40.935
On a more positive note,

00:40.974 --> 00:42.999
we haven't had a Ray Pruit
sighting in days.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.635
You're not calling again,
are you?

00:44.677 --> 00:45.803
I can't help it.

00:48.448 --> 00:49.574
Ti-Tiny?

00:49.616 --> 00:51.140
Hi, it's Donna.
Is Joe around?

00:51.184 --> 00:53.516
Uh, just a second.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.021
A.K., it's Joe's girlfriend.

00:56.122 --> 00:57.111
This is A.K.

00:57.157 --> 00:58.351
Hey, what's going on?

00:58.391 --> 01:00.018
He's talking with the police.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.858
Some guy's claming Joe pounded
on him Halloween night.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.760
On Halloween?

01:04.798 --> 01:05.765
Oh, no.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.357
I'll tell him you called.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.231
I got to go.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.538
Damn him.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.665
Joe?

01:14.707 --> 01:15.696
Ray.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.439
He's not giving up.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:47.100 --> 02:49.591
Give me some room here, guys.

02:49.636 --> 02:50.796
May I have
your attention, please?

02:50.837 --> 02:52.168
May I have your
attention, please?!

02:52.205 --> 02:53.467
Listen up, Condor maniacs!

02:53.506 --> 02:54.700
Thanks, Muntz.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.902
A lot of you
may already know me.

02:56.943 --> 02:59.343
But for those of you who don't,
I'm Steve Sanders.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.380
I've been appointed the guardian

03:04.417 --> 03:08.319
over the Condor,
Cornelius J. Condor.

03:11.057 --> 03:12.957
I want you all to know

03:13.059 --> 03:15.493
that when our warriors
take that field against

03:15.528 --> 03:17.826
those cross-town
unmentionables...

03:18.932 --> 03:20.058
that Corny will be there!

03:21.467 --> 03:24.925
Corny will be there
as he is every year

03:24.971 --> 03:27.872
to watch over our warriors
to ensure a victory.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.774
- Victory!
- Victory!

03:32.378 --> 03:35.973
Guarding Corny is no easy task.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.246
As I speak,
there are S.C.U. students

03:39.285 --> 03:41.446
conspiring to snatch him.

03:42.488 --> 03:43.978
Uh-huh.

03:44.023 --> 03:45.991
That's not gonna happen
on my watch, folks.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.926
At 3:00 today,
Corny's gonna be crated up

03:48.962 --> 03:50.793
and transported
to a secret location

03:50.830 --> 03:53.298
known only
to my covert Condor patrol.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.665
So until Saturday,

03:55.702 --> 03:58.796
let the demons of generosity
be with us.

04:02.542 --> 04:03.634
Yeah!

04:05.411 --> 04:07.402
Our Corny...

04:07.447 --> 04:10.610
S.C.U. will definitely
be out for revenge.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.083
Last year, a bunch of us
got together

04:12.118 --> 04:13.676
and we stole their stuffed bear.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.950
Yeah, spy versus spy.

04:16.022 --> 04:16.954
Sounds like fun.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.718
It is.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.055
You know, you're part of
C.U. now, Professor Robbins.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.221
Maybe you should join the ranks.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.356
Well, I'd only do it
if you were doing it.

04:25.398 --> 04:26.660
Well, I've already
done it, sorry.

04:26.699 --> 04:27.666
See you later.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.065
Bye.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.128
How'd I do, our man?

04:32.171 --> 04:34.969
Like they say,
sounds like school spirit.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.974
Well, thanks a lot.
Hey, Silver,

04:37.043 --> 04:38.271
where's Valerie?

04:38.311 --> 04:40.074
She was the chief architect
in the great bear heist,

04:40.113 --> 04:41.080
and she's missing all this?

04:41.114 --> 04:42.081
Beats me.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.104
Could've sworn she'd be here.

05:13.379 --> 05:14.471
I'm sorry.

05:14.514 --> 05:15.947
I got here a little early,
Valerie.

05:16.015 --> 05:17.607
All right, Jonesy,
what are you doing here?

05:17.650 --> 05:20.847
Remember that favor I did
for you and Dylan in old Mexico?

05:21.621 --> 05:23.145
It's payback time.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.781
- Yeah, yeah, right.
- Do you mind?

05:24.824 --> 05:27.054
No, no, not at all.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.060
So, uh...

05:29.929 --> 05:31.419
how's detective life?

05:31.464 --> 05:33.091
Well, it's booming.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.793
So, uh, did you
hear about Dylan?

05:34.834 --> 05:35.801
Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.826
I got a, uh, blow by blow

05:37.870 --> 05:39.064
from a bud at the Bureau.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.970
But, uh, you know,
what the hell, I wish him luck.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.702
Yeah, we all do.

05:42.742 --> 05:43.902
Wherever he is.

05:43.943 --> 05:45.342
You know, I could find him
if you want me to.

05:45.378 --> 05:47.812
I don't think
he wants to be found.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.839
That's good, because, uh, that's
not the reason why I'm here.

05:50.883 --> 05:52.874
You're calling in my promise.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.444
You know, that's what
I love about you.

05:55.488 --> 05:58.753
You can dance, Valerie,
you can dance to any tune.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.259
Listen, Jonesy, just break it
down for me first, okay?

06:01.294 --> 06:03.125
I'm not the same girl
I was in Mexico.

06:03.162 --> 06:04.390
Well, I don't know about that.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.897
I mean, from where I'm sitting,

06:05.932 --> 06:09.060
you are definitely, uh, topping
out the old, uh, scorch meter.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.933
- Whoosh!
- You were saying?

06:10.970 --> 06:14.531
Okay, uh, this gig is like
cotton candy compared to Mexico.

06:14.574 --> 06:16.940
I need you for one night, okay?

06:17.009 --> 06:18.237
You don't have to leave town.

06:18.277 --> 06:19.744
And I'll tell you
what, I'll throw in

06:19.779 --> 06:23.044
a very tasteful wardrobe, okay?

06:23.082 --> 06:24.549
You owe me.

06:24.584 --> 06:25.551
Say yes?

06:25.585 --> 06:28.110
Come on, who's your buddy?

06:28.154 --> 06:29.883
Who's your buddy? Yes?

06:31.090 --> 06:32.057
Okay, yes.

06:32.091 --> 06:33.888
Yes!

06:40.233 --> 06:42.531
What's going on?

06:42.568 --> 06:43.865
I might be charged with battery

06:43.903 --> 06:47.669
for that, uh,
that fight with Ray.

06:47.707 --> 06:48.674
I'm sorry.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.336
I had to tell Coach,

06:51.377 --> 06:53.140
and, uh, that's when he realized

06:53.179 --> 06:54.976
that I must have missed
curfew Halloween night.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.641
He checked and found out someone
else had signed in for me.

06:57.683 --> 07:01.210
And, uh, he suspended me
for one game.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.484
Yeah, but if you
hadn't been there,

07:03.523 --> 07:05.354
I don't know what
would have happened to me.

07:05.391 --> 07:09.350
Doesn't matter now.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.226
Sports radio's suddenly
reporting S.C.U.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.492
as a heavy favorite.

07:12.532 --> 07:15.626
This dorm is not exactly
the happiest place on Earth.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.158
Joe.

07:17.203 --> 07:18.727
Coach said
to stay away from her.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.602
You want him to sit you out
for another game?

07:25.578 --> 07:26.943
I have to go, Donna.

07:27.013 --> 07:29.004
I know.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.242
Do us all a favor:
go away.

07:50.903 --> 07:52.370
And I'll tell you what,

07:52.405 --> 07:55.397
I'll throw in a very
tasteful wardrobe, okay?

08:00.213 --> 08:03.080
Dylan, this is Fran Irving
from Lahaina Bay Realty.

08:03.115 --> 08:04.605
Thursday.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.881
I'm dying to show you the most
fabulous piece of beachfront,

08:07.920 --> 08:09.911
but you have to call me.

08:09.956 --> 08:12.652
808-555-0141.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.922
Aloha.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.724
Brandon.

08:16.762 --> 08:17.786
I know.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.889
I said I'd only be a second.

08:19.932 --> 08:23.197
Well, I wouldn't care,
but if I start showing up

08:23.236 --> 08:25.363
late to the staff meetings,
everybody else will, too.

08:25.404 --> 08:27.338
Sorry.

08:27.373 --> 08:31.207
Do you know exactly what
"close up the place" means?

08:31.244 --> 08:33.508
Because it just seems
kind of vague to me,

08:33.546 --> 08:36.743
and I don't know exactly
where to start.

08:36.782 --> 08:38.510
If you want to stay
here, you should.

08:38.551 --> 08:40.849
Just let me take your car, okay?

08:40.886 --> 08:42.946
You want to take my car?

08:42.989 --> 08:44.957
Sure. Why?

08:44.991 --> 08:46.151
No, that's all right.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.285
Let's go.

08:48.327 --> 08:51.592
Look, I know this hasn't been
getting any easier for you.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.496
Is there anything
I can do for you?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.932
Yeah, you can cheer me up.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.963
Well, I know something
you can do.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.472
- What's that?
- Well, you haven't written

09:00.506 --> 09:01.837
a column yet this week.

09:01.874 --> 09:05.310
Maybe that might help you
back in the swing of things.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.539
Is that a hint, Ms. Editor?

09:07.580 --> 09:09.275
Of course not.

09:18.257 --> 09:20.623
Now the moment
you've been waiting for.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.719
The announcement
of the seven ladies

09:22.762 --> 09:24.320
who will comprise
the Royal Court.

09:24.363 --> 09:28.993
Princess three,
number 119, Cara Gannon.

09:31.737 --> 09:35.070
Number 381, Tiffany Ramos.

09:35.107 --> 09:36.938
It's about time.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.705
The freeway was
shut down to one lane.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.940
Princess four, number 400,
Virginia Vanover.

09:42.048 --> 09:45.040
Donna's gonna have a fit when
she sees that her mom's here.

09:45.084 --> 09:48.679
Typical Felice.
Show up for the glory.

09:48.721 --> 09:51.246
Hmm, not exactly. She's probably
here to gloat when Donna loses.

09:51.290 --> 09:52.587
Mm-hmm.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.025
Princess five,
number 132, Lisa Dixon.

10:00.900 --> 10:05.303
Number six, number 512,
Neda Shokrian.

10:07.707 --> 10:10.471
I still can't believe
she got this far.

10:10.509 --> 10:11.976
And princess seven,

10:12.078 --> 10:15.639
number 675, Donna Martin.

10:31.998 --> 10:35.832
Well, it looks like you're
going to have to tell her now.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.399
There I am.

10:39.438 --> 10:40.700
It is you.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.173
I knew it was you.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.641
Why would you lie to me?

10:43.676 --> 10:46.873
The day after
this picture was taken,

10:46.912 --> 10:49.608
I found out I was pregnant.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.311
What?

10:52.351 --> 10:54.683
I was 19 years old, living
at home with my parents.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.187
Your father was
in medical school.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.117
We had to get married
as quickly as we could.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.458
I never told anyone.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.930
Not my parents, not
even my best friend.

11:08.668 --> 11:14.163
And then, of course, I had
to drop out of the competition

11:14.206 --> 11:16.174
because the tournament
has rules

11:16.208 --> 11:17.573
about married girls
participating.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.635
That was 26 years ago.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.340
What happened to the baby?

11:23.549 --> 11:25.039
I had a miscarriage.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.649
Oh, Mom, I'm so sorry.

11:30.322 --> 11:34.258
No, Donna, I'm the one
who's sorry.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.985
I wanted you to quit, too.

11:37.063 --> 11:40.294
I didn't want you to find out
what a fraud your mother is.

11:41.967 --> 11:44.663
No, you're not a fraud.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.433
Yes, I am.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.565
I mean, how could
I preach virginity

11:48.607 --> 11:52.737
when here I was, even younger
than you, engaging in free love?

11:52.778 --> 11:55.008
What kind of a life lesson
is that?

11:55.081 --> 11:57.447
I love the lessons
you've taught me.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.110
They're the best lessons.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.183
You don't think I'm a hypocrite?

12:03.222 --> 12:06.714
You'd only be that if you
hadn't told me the truth.

12:06.759 --> 12:09.250
I love you so much.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.964
I only want
the very best for you.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.830
I hope you believe that.

12:15.868 --> 12:18.666
I do.

12:18.704 --> 12:21.104
I love you, too, Mom.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.042
Come on, come on.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.345
Where do we put it?

12:35.387 --> 12:36.752
Put it in the foyer.

12:36.789 --> 12:37.881
You're gonna put it in there?

12:37.923 --> 12:39.686
Why don't you just put
a big sign on it

12:39.725 --> 12:40.851
that says C.U. Mascot?

12:40.893 --> 12:41.985
By the way, it's "foy-yea."

12:42.061 --> 12:43.358
"Foy-yea," whatever.
Listen.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.488
Why don't you just chill
and take orders, okay?

12:46.832 --> 12:49.596
Well, if it isn't
the deserter.

12:49.635 --> 12:50.897
Valerie, where the hell

12:50.936 --> 12:52.733
have you been?
You're missing all the action.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.003
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
flake, but something came up.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.201
Can you guys get by
this year without me?

12:58.244 --> 12:59.643
You hear that, Corny?

12:59.678 --> 13:01.145
Valerie's deserting us.
What should I...?

13:01.180 --> 13:03.648
Oh.

13:03.682 --> 13:05.081
What did he say?

13:05.117 --> 13:06.675
He said, Valerie who?

13:06.719 --> 13:07.777
He's a fickle bird.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.117
You guys thirsty?

13:09.155 --> 13:11.680
- There's some beer
in the fridge. - All righty.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.960
So, uh, you okay?

13:17.062 --> 13:19.121
No. Uh, something came up.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.190
Oh, well, if it has anything
to do with the club,

13:21.233 --> 13:22.200
I'll give you a hand.

13:22.234 --> 13:24.566
No, actually, it's personal.

13:24.603 --> 13:26.434
Um, I'm going to have
to go out later.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.461
It's no big deal.

13:27.506 --> 13:30.236
Do you need a ride?

13:30.276 --> 13:32.904
No, I have to finish
up some business.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.139
Alone.

13:36.782 --> 13:38.773
What kind of business?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.217
Old business.

13:40.252 --> 13:42.413
Now are you going to give me
the third degree,

13:42.454 --> 13:43.921
or are you going to kiss me?

13:43.956 --> 13:46.754
No, I'm going to give you
the third degree.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.089
I can't imagine
what's so important.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.095
Fine.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.960
I thought you'd understand.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.329
Understand what? You won't even
tell me what's going on.

13:54.366 --> 13:57.335
Look, David, could I have
my personal life, please?

13:57.369 --> 13:59.530
I mean, do I have
to tell you everything?

14:02.608 --> 14:04.132
Sorry.

14:17.723 --> 14:19.350
Hi.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.382
Come on in the car.

14:32.004 --> 14:35.667
So, you ready to rock
and stroll, Valerie?

14:35.708 --> 14:37.107
I'm not getting out of the car.

14:37.142 --> 14:38.666
Of course you are.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.474
Look, this guy likes to, uh,
pick them up from the streets,

14:40.512 --> 14:41.536
all right?

14:41.580 --> 14:43.104
That's how he gets
his little rush.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.274
Come on, here we go.

14:44.316 --> 14:46.750
Come on. Aah...

14:51.190 --> 14:53.488
Step lightly, me little lassie.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.729
Uh...

15:09.441 --> 15:11.671
Well, um,

15:11.710 --> 15:13.541
you know what I want
you to do, right?

15:13.579 --> 15:14.944
Forget it.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.380
I am not gonna parade around
and shake my little moneymaker,

15:17.416 --> 15:18.610
- okay?
- Oh, no, no, no.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.777
Of course you're not.
I mean, these girls

15:19.818 --> 15:21.410
are, uh, they're too obvious.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.250
What, what this guy wants,
you know, is, uh,

15:23.289 --> 15:24.688
some attitude, right?

15:24.723 --> 15:27.055
So, you just kind of snuggle up
to the old Cadillac here,

15:27.092 --> 15:28.286
show a little.

15:28.327 --> 15:29.851
And you look like you are P.O.'d

15:29.895 --> 15:30.884
at somebody, all right?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.227
Great. I can do that.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.492
Listen, Valerie,

15:33.532 --> 15:35.329
I got your back all the
way on this, all right?

15:35.367 --> 15:36.561
Now, with any kind of luck,

15:36.602 --> 15:38.092
this white limo's
gonna be cruising by

15:38.137 --> 15:39.764
within the hour.

15:39.805 --> 15:41.204
Look, you know me,
I've done my homework.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.605
Why? Because I'm
a total professional.

15:42.641 --> 15:45.303
Wait, I have to get
in the car with him?

15:45.344 --> 15:46.106
Yeah.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.703
No way!

15:47.746 --> 15:48.872
No! No way!

15:48.914 --> 15:50.279
Valerie, Valerie,
no, no, no, listen,

15:50.316 --> 15:52.284
listen, listen, okay?

15:52.318 --> 15:54.183
The driver...
he's working with us.

15:54.219 --> 15:56.244
He's gonna take you
to the Bel Ami Hotel,

15:56.288 --> 15:59.280
because, uh, fun boy likes
to impress the trash.

15:59.325 --> 16:01.259
Oh, thanks for the compliment.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.761
At-at the hotel, I've got
a photographer placed there.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.127
Catch him with his pants down.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.324
Pop. Pop. Click. Click.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.356
We fold up the tent

16:08.400 --> 16:10.368
and on to our, uh,
meaningful lives.

16:10.402 --> 16:11.596
All right, who is this guy?

16:11.637 --> 16:12.934
Well, that's a secret, remember?

16:13.038 --> 16:16.166
But, uh, I don't know,
we can call him the Duke.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.732
And is there a "Duchess"?

16:17.776 --> 16:19.073
Oh, yeah,

16:19.111 --> 16:21.238
but she's hoping
to become an ex-Duchess.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.646
Or should I say
a very rich ex-Duchess?

16:23.682 --> 16:27.243
The, uh, photos are...
well, they're for her.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.277
What, you're working
on a divorce case?

16:29.321 --> 16:30.288
Yeah.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.653
- How cheesy.
- Wha...

16:31.690 --> 16:33.419
This guy's a creep.

16:33.459 --> 16:34.585
He's a wife beater,

16:34.626 --> 16:36.856
he deserves to be put away.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.534
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.695
What's going on?

16:44.737 --> 16:46.705
What are you guys doing here?

16:46.739 --> 16:49.708
Kelly, your man is our
deepest cover agent.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.710
He's been working
for the cause all week.

16:51.744 --> 16:52.972
He has?

16:53.012 --> 16:54.343
It's no big deal.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.280
I, uh, I oversaw the making

16:56.315 --> 16:58.977
of a counterfeit Cornelius
J. Condor in the art lab.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.144
That's about it.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.812
- You're kidding.
- Mm-hmm.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.788
That's a decoy sitting
in the Walsh Foyer.

17:03.822 --> 17:05.790
Huh.

17:05.824 --> 17:08.622
So, where's the real Corny?

17:08.660 --> 17:10.627
Hmm, I have no idea.

17:10.662 --> 17:11.890
Oh!

17:17.803 --> 17:19.771
Hello?

17:19.805 --> 17:20.863
Joe?

17:20.906 --> 17:22.464
I thought you couldn't call.

17:22.508 --> 17:25.136
Yeah, well, the guys are over
at the Coach's for a chalk talk.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.406
Donna, why didn't you tell me
that you made the court?

17:27.445 --> 17:28.743
You heard?

17:28.781 --> 17:30.612
Yeah, I had to watch it on TV.

17:30.649 --> 17:32.617
You looked so pretty,

17:32.651 --> 17:34.209
so excited.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.312
Yeah, I was.

17:36.355 --> 17:39.347
Hey, don't worry about me.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.621
All right, everything
works out for the best.

17:41.660 --> 17:42.649
They do?

17:42.694 --> 17:43.683
Yeah.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.526
You just have to keep faith.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.156
That's what my dad
always used to say,

17:47.199 --> 17:48.564
and he made a believer
out of me.

17:48.600 --> 17:52.127
I can't believe
how calm you are.

17:52.171 --> 17:54.162
Anything more happen
with the police?

17:54.206 --> 17:57.175
Yeah, uh, the city attorney
reviewed Ray's complaint

17:57.209 --> 17:59.734
and pressed formal charges.

17:59.778 --> 18:02.372
I'm really sorry.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.642
No one's supposed to know
until Monday.

18:03.682 --> 18:04.706
That's when I'm being arraigned.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.081
Well, is there anything

18:06.118 --> 18:07.449
- I can do?
- Yeah.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.647
I'm sure my lawyer would love
to talk to you tomorrow.

18:09.688 --> 18:12.350
Oh. Okay.

18:12.391 --> 18:15.155
Sure, um... any time.
I just have to be

18:15.194 --> 18:17.162
at the Tournament House
in the afternoon.

18:17.196 --> 18:18.754
Just tell him to call me.

18:18.797 --> 18:19.786
Okay, I will.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.629
Uh, his name is Bruce Paxton.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.635
Look, I'd better get going.

18:23.669 --> 18:25.637
I'll talk to you soon.

18:25.671 --> 18:27.696
And, uh...

18:27.739 --> 18:29.730
I really miss you, Donna.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.766
I miss you, too.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.943
You know, I don't get it.
Is it too much to ask?

18:39.985 --> 18:42.078
Can you at least stand up?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.385
Jonesy, my feet are
killing me, okay?

18:44.423 --> 18:46.823
Face it, the white
limo is not coming.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.293
Well, you might be right.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.125
I should probably pull the plug.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.688
Terrific. Jonesy,
have a great life.

18:53.732 --> 18:54.926
Sorry it didn't work out.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.527
No, wait, wait.
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

18:57.569 --> 18:59.059
You gotta trust me here.

18:59.104 --> 19:00.469
Now this guy is a...

19:00.506 --> 19:02.997
he's a, he's a creature
of habit, all right?

19:03.041 --> 19:05.168
I think we should get
one more night.

19:05.210 --> 19:08.202
Besides, little girl,
you owe me.

19:12.184 --> 19:17.588
Sanders, I know I agreed
to this little homecoming stunt,

19:17.623 --> 19:19.750
but could you please
keep Muntz and company

19:19.791 --> 19:21.782
from dropping chips
and beer nuts

19:21.827 --> 19:24.591
all over
953 Hillcrest Drive, huh?

19:24.630 --> 19:25.597
Hey, chill, man.

19:25.631 --> 19:27.326
It'll all be over tonight.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.266
You look like you
could use some fun.

19:29.301 --> 19:30.893
Why don't you hang out
with us tonight?

19:30.936 --> 19:33.928
No. I've got stuff to do at
McKay's and a column to write.

19:34.039 --> 19:36.599
Just don't turn my house
into a frat sty.

19:40.279 --> 19:42.372
He'll snap out of it.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.518
Okay, well, thank you
for coming in.

19:51.557 --> 19:52.922
Whatever I can do.

19:52.958 --> 19:56.416
Well, you're
an eyewitness, Donna.

19:56.461 --> 19:58.292
Your word carries
lots of weight.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.300
You know, I, uh,
I was wondering

20:04.336 --> 20:06.896
what could happen to Joe
if he's found guilty?

20:06.939 --> 20:09.407
Well, the maximum penalty
is a $2,000 fine

20:09.441 --> 20:10.931
and six months in jail.

20:10.976 --> 20:12.375
Don't worry about that.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.208
After hearing your side
of the story,

20:14.246 --> 20:16.407
I think we have
a defense here;

20:16.448 --> 20:18.916
Joe was protecting you.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.511
But the thing is,
after Monday's arraignment,

20:21.553 --> 20:23.680
the fact that you were abused
by your ex-boyfriend

20:23.722 --> 20:25.815
is going to become
a matter of public record.

20:25.857 --> 20:28.849
So, you ready for that?

20:30.462 --> 20:31.486
Yeah.

20:31.530 --> 20:33.498
Are you sure?

20:33.532 --> 20:37.332
Yeah, I will be
as soon as I tell my parents.

20:43.075 --> 20:47.011
Steve, anything?

20:47.112 --> 20:50.639
Yes! Yes!
We have liftoff.

20:52.551 --> 20:55.145
Shh, Valerie's still sleeping.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.677
Not anymore.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.747
She's up.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.121
Sort of.

21:00.158 --> 21:01.284
Sorry, Val.

21:01.326 --> 21:02.156
No, you're not.

21:04.863 --> 21:07.525
What am I, invisible?

21:07.566 --> 21:09.397
Morning, David.

21:17.242 --> 21:20.473
Hey, you want me to get you
some juice or something?

21:20.512 --> 21:22.980
You look pretty wasted.

21:23.081 --> 21:25.345
Oh, yeah, that would be great.
Thanks.

21:25.384 --> 21:28.080
I guess I got in
pretty late, huh?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.246
Yeah.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.779
Well, I, I gave up calling
after 1:30.

21:35.193 --> 21:36.990
So, how'd it go?

21:37.029 --> 21:39.964
Listen, I don't want
to talk about it.

21:39.998 --> 21:42.489
Just don't make a big deal
about it, okay?

21:45.537 --> 21:51.442
Well, whatever it was,
I'm, uh, I'm glad it's over.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.308
I'm gonna take you out tonight,

21:54.346 --> 21:55.643
so I don't want any arguments.

21:55.681 --> 21:58.411
David, I can't go out tonight.

21:58.450 --> 22:00.145
This business isn't finished.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.151
I gotta know.

22:07.192 --> 22:10.457
Um...

22:10.495 --> 22:12.929
Is there a... a guy involved?

22:12.964 --> 22:15.933
Just tell me that.

22:15.967 --> 22:17.628
Please, no questions, okay?

22:17.669 --> 22:20.137
I mean, I'll be able
to tell you someday.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.662
I just can't tell you right now.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.074
So there is a guy involved.

22:28.113 --> 22:29.637
Yes, but it's not
what you think.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.384
What guy?

22:36.421 --> 22:38.548
Are you gonna get me juice
or not?

22:38.590 --> 22:39.887
Do I know him?

22:39.925 --> 22:40.983
Why are you acting so jealous?

22:41.059 --> 22:42.117
I'm not jealous, all right?

22:42.160 --> 22:43.354
I'm just upset 'cause

22:43.395 --> 22:44.623
you won't be honest with me.

22:44.663 --> 22:46.255
You know what?
Forget about the juice.

22:46.298 --> 22:47.629
Just forget about
the good mornings.

22:47.666 --> 22:50.931
Just leave me the hell alone,
okay? I need a shower.

22:55.974 --> 22:57.407
It's a nice outfit.

22:57.442 --> 22:59.706
Who'd you wear this for?

23:02.447 --> 23:04.813
David, look,
I have a headache, okay?

23:04.850 --> 23:07.842
It's not like we're
married or something.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.148
Just give me
a little space here.

23:09.187 --> 23:10.814
I'll give you tons of space.

23:10.856 --> 23:12.380
You're acting so childish.

23:12.424 --> 23:13.721
I really hate that.

23:13.759 --> 23:14.919
How else can I act?

23:14.960 --> 23:16.484
It's not like I'm one
of the guys

23:16.528 --> 23:17.927
who gets to be adult with you.

23:17.963 --> 23:20.056
What's that supposed to mean?

23:20.098 --> 23:22.293
You know how you keep telling me

23:22.334 --> 23:23.926
to be patient
with this relationship?

23:23.969 --> 23:25.095
Yeah.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.126
Yeah, well, I think

23:26.171 --> 23:27.399
my patience just ran out.

23:33.478 --> 23:34.672
Lisa.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.476
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:36.515 --> 23:38.540
- Want to grab a bite to eat?
- Oh, I'd love to,

23:38.583 --> 23:39.982
but I've got to get
straight to work.

23:40.018 --> 23:41.815
I need to talk to my boss
about my schedule.

23:41.853 --> 23:43.320
I didn't realize
there was gonna be

23:43.355 --> 23:44.652
so many fittings next week.

23:44.689 --> 23:46.714
Well, if you ever need
any help with anything,

23:46.758 --> 23:47.725
just ask.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.818
I warn you, I'm not shy.

23:49.861 --> 23:52.159
Who's that?

23:52.197 --> 23:53.459
That's Ray.

23:53.498 --> 23:54.658
The Ray?

23:54.699 --> 23:56.564
Yeah. I'll see you later.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.365
No, no, no, I'm gonna
wait right here for you.

23:59.404 --> 24:00.735
Okay, thanks.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.770
Hey, Donna.

24:06.812 --> 24:08.939
How'd you know I was here?

24:08.980 --> 24:11.608
You could get the schedule for
the Royal Court just by calling.

24:11.650 --> 24:14.244
Look, I'm really happy for you.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.220
I kind of feel like
I've been there

24:16.254 --> 24:17.653
since the beginning of all this.

24:17.689 --> 24:19.554
How can you stand there
sweet-talking me

24:19.591 --> 24:22.116
when you are making my life
and Joe's a living hell?

24:22.160 --> 24:23.627
Look, I gave you fair warning,

24:23.662 --> 24:25.357
and I'm gonna give you
a second chance.

24:25.397 --> 24:27.262
- What are you talking about?
- My lawyer said

24:27.299 --> 24:29.790
there's no case against Joe
if I don't testify.

24:29.835 --> 24:31.462
So, what do you want me to do?

24:31.503 --> 24:33.232
Dump Joe and come running
back to you?

24:33.271 --> 24:34.568
Is that so bad?

24:34.606 --> 24:36.437
We were happy, Donna.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.444
No! No, we were living a lie.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.969
And anything more between us
makes that a bigger lie.

24:42.013 --> 24:43.571
Now go ahead with your charges.

24:43.615 --> 24:44.946
The truth will come out.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.213
Yeah, it will.

24:47.252 --> 24:48.913
I'll see you in court.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.928
Hi.

25:07.272 --> 25:08.239
Hi.

25:08.273 --> 25:10.138
I was driving by
and I saw your car.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.575
What's in the bag?

25:12.611 --> 25:13.771
Good eats.

25:13.812 --> 25:15.905
In case we get hungry.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.550
Just driving by, huh?

25:19.584 --> 25:20.881
Okay.

25:20.919 --> 25:23.786
I didn't think you should
have to do this alone.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.585
Shouldn't you be off

25:25.624 --> 25:28.149
guarding Cornelius J. Condor
or something?

25:28.193 --> 25:31.162
Brandon, you're not
the only one who misses him.

25:33.832 --> 25:34.856
Sorry.

25:39.971 --> 25:42.405
It's just I've been,
I've been coming here all week

25:42.440 --> 25:45.807
and checking his messages
and getting his mail and...

25:49.581 --> 25:51.572
I don't think
he's ever coming back.

25:55.987 --> 25:57.682
So, why do I bother?

25:59.324 --> 26:03.055
Because you're his friend,
and you love him.

26:03.094 --> 26:05.858
And that's not ever gonna
change for you or for me.

26:11.970 --> 26:14.234
Well...

26:14.272 --> 26:15.466
I'm glad you came.

26:17.142 --> 26:19.042
Good. Do you want
some help or not?

26:19.077 --> 26:21.568
Yes. Fine, I want some help.

26:21.613 --> 26:22.807
Good.

26:27.619 --> 26:28.586
Hey.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.053
How you doing?

26:31.623 --> 26:33.250
Okay, I'm gonna
call you, all right?

26:33.291 --> 26:34.280
I will. I promise.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.549
Valerie?

26:36.595 --> 26:37.687
Where're you going?

26:37.729 --> 26:40.289
Don't be going anywhere.

26:40.332 --> 26:41.424
What's the matter with you?

26:41.466 --> 26:42.490
Look, I'm going
to get some coffee.

26:42.534 --> 26:43.660
The guy can wait.

26:43.702 --> 26:45.101
Let's get something
clear, all right?

26:45.136 --> 26:47.536
You have a chance to share
in a sizable bonus.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.506
- So?
- "So"?

26:49.541 --> 26:51.270
So don't forget
we are playing hardball.

26:51.309 --> 26:52.298
Come on, batter up, girl.

26:52.344 --> 26:53.641
You know, this is
all making me

26:53.678 --> 26:55.578
a little too hard. I think
I lost my boyfriend today.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.138
Yeah, well, that might
be for the best.

26:57.182 --> 26:58.706
I mean, he's probably
one of these guys

26:58.750 --> 27:00.445
who's just gonna fade
when the chips are down.

27:00.485 --> 27:02.544
You know, I can't believe
I'm getting dating advice

27:02.587 --> 27:05.522
from a guy that Dylan told me
travels with an inflatable doll.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.889
See, right there, man.
Right there, right there.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.826
Rumors, rumors, ru...

27:11.730 --> 27:12.924
Wait a second.

27:12.998 --> 27:13.930
Here we go.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.125
Here we go. Come on.

27:19.938 --> 27:21.599
Uh-uh. Shoo. Shoo, shoo.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.641
I got just the ticket
for you tonight, sport.

27:29.681 --> 27:31.842
I'm sorry. I'm just looking
for directions.

27:31.883 --> 27:33.248
No, no. Listen to me closely.

27:33.284 --> 27:35.252
I can get you
into paradise tonight.

27:35.286 --> 27:36.878
Meet Heavenly.

27:38.089 --> 27:39.454
Are you gonna leave
me standing here,

27:39.491 --> 27:40.480
or can I come in?

27:40.525 --> 27:42.550
Well, I'm not sure I understand.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.562
Let me make this
real simple, okay?

27:44.596 --> 27:46.860
$200 an hour and
she gets in your car.

27:48.099 --> 27:49.589
Satisfaction guaranteed.

27:49.634 --> 27:50.760
Guaranteed.

27:50.802 --> 27:52.667
Police officer.
Hold it right there.

27:52.704 --> 27:55.104
- Put your hands on the car.
- Ahh...

27:56.307 --> 27:57.296
What's going on?

27:57.342 --> 27:58.832
We're cooked.

27:58.877 --> 28:01.402
You're under arrest
for violation 647B

28:01.446 --> 28:03.539
of the Penal Code of
the state of California.

28:03.581 --> 28:05.549
You have the right
to remain silent.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.744
If you choose
to give up that right,

28:07.786 --> 28:10.220
everything you say can
and will be used against you

28:10.255 --> 28:11.415
in a court of law.

28:11.456 --> 28:12.753
Do you understand those rights?

28:12.791 --> 28:13.917
Yes.

28:19.998 --> 28:21.932
Come on.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.490
Easy, easy,

28:23.535 --> 28:24.832
easy!

28:26.137 --> 28:27.161
Aw.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.934
I hate you.

28:30.341 --> 28:32.275
You asked for it.

28:37.949 --> 28:39.314
Hi, Susan.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.511
Come on in.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.350
I am in.

28:47.625 --> 28:50.116
- This probably looks
pretty strange. - Yeah.

28:50.161 --> 28:52.789
Oh, please, don't, uh,
stop on my account.

28:52.831 --> 28:54.264
Really, I just brought by
these brownies.

28:54.299 --> 28:56.233
I thought you might
need a little sugar rush.

28:58.970 --> 29:00.597
No, no, don't need that.

29:01.773 --> 29:03.263
How are you at controlling

29:03.308 --> 29:05.640
a, uh, killer plastic robot?

29:05.677 --> 29:07.542
Oh, go ahead, really.
I don't need to play.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.013
Oh, yes, you do,
because I am late

29:10.048 --> 29:12.073
for a very important date,
and I guess we got

29:12.117 --> 29:13.550
a little carried away here.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.052
It's all my fault.
I never should've

29:15.086 --> 29:16.553
given Dylan this
in the first place.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.850
I can't believe he kept it.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.880
Well,

29:19.924 --> 29:22.552
I'm gonna leave while
I am still undefeated.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.892
She lies.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.760
Hey, Kel, thanks
for all your help.

29:26.798 --> 29:27.765
I-I appreciate it.

29:27.799 --> 29:29.460
You're welcome.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.095
Looks like Kelly got
you out of your funk.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.937
Yeah, well, she's a good friend.

29:39.144 --> 29:41.135
I, uh, baked them myself.

29:43.148 --> 29:46.242
Well, you know, I-I don't
really deserve one.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.275
I haven't, uh,
written my column yet.

29:48.319 --> 29:50.253
You know, I don't care.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.256
I want to be a good friend, too.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.952
Actually, I want to be a lot
more than a good friend.

30:12.177 --> 30:13.371
Hello.

30:13.411 --> 30:14.503
David.

30:14.546 --> 30:15.570
Valerie? I'm sleeping.

30:15.613 --> 30:16.875
Good-bye.

30:16.915 --> 30:17.882
Don't hang up, okay.

30:17.916 --> 30:18.905
You're my one call.

30:18.950 --> 30:20.281
What?

30:20.318 --> 30:22.684
Listen, just listen
to me very carefully.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.210
I need you to bail me out.

30:24.255 --> 30:26.314
You're in jail?

30:26.357 --> 30:27.881
Can you get a thousand
dollars in cash?

30:27.926 --> 30:29.621
What are you in jail for?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.526
I'm in Central Detention
downtown.

30:31.563 --> 30:33.929
I'll, uh, I'll tell you why
later.

30:33.965 --> 30:35.956
No, no, no, tell me now.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.331
What'd they arrest you for?

30:37.368 --> 30:39.666
Prostitution.

30:39.704 --> 30:41.968
What? You're serious?

30:42.006 --> 30:43.974
It was all a mistake.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.566
Please, just hurry, okay?

30:49.013 --> 30:50.173
That's it, honey.

30:50.215 --> 30:51.409
Everybody's waiting.

31:05.129 --> 31:06.096
Here's your stuff, honey.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.290
I'll get your walking papers.

31:12.303 --> 31:13.600
Thank you.

31:13.638 --> 31:15.128
Sure.

31:16.507 --> 31:19.135
So, are you okay?

31:19.177 --> 31:20.940
Yeah.

31:20.979 --> 31:24.938
I guess I really
disappointed you.

31:24.983 --> 31:26.951
I guess.

31:26.985 --> 31:30.148
Listen, David,
I want to explain.

31:30.188 --> 31:31.382
Not now.

31:44.202 --> 31:46.932
You know, Val,
I can't help thinking...

31:48.873 --> 31:51.967
You could've phoned anyone
with that one call. I mean...

31:52.010 --> 31:53.739
Brandon, Steve, Nat...

31:58.016 --> 32:00.075
But you called me.

32:02.620 --> 32:03.951
Wasn't even close.

32:04.055 --> 32:05.682
Why?

32:07.625 --> 32:10.856
You're the only one
I can let see me like this.

32:13.631 --> 32:17.328
I'm really embarrassed, David.

32:17.368 --> 32:20.804
Don't be.

32:20.838 --> 32:21.998
We'll handle it.

32:25.176 --> 32:27.303
Oh... Val!

32:27.345 --> 32:30.178
Well, here we are. I was just,
uh, getting to you.

32:30.214 --> 32:31.476
Well, you're a little late.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.507
Listen, I am so sorry,

32:33.551 --> 32:35.951
putting you through what you
had to go through, but, uh...

32:35.987 --> 32:39.081
Oh, Val, you gotta look at
the bright side of things, huh?

32:39.123 --> 32:40.613
Well, I hope you
pulled some strings.

32:40.658 --> 32:41.750
Strings?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.420
I pulled the whole rope.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.951
Now, uh, all the charges

32:44.996 --> 32:47.191
have been dropped
and, uh, your record is clean.

32:47.231 --> 32:50.496
- Who is this clown?
- Clown?

32:50.535 --> 32:51.627
- Yeah.
- Why? Are you laughing?

32:51.669 --> 32:52.829
David! David, listen. Wait.

32:52.870 --> 32:53.962
This is Jay J. Jones.

32:54.005 --> 32:55.495
- David?
- Yeah. Detective,

32:55.540 --> 32:56.768
um... he's a friend of Dylan's.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.639
And a friend of yours, Val.

32:58.676 --> 33:01.645
So, uh... this is

33:01.679 --> 33:03.078
the, uh, new boyfriend, huh?

33:03.114 --> 33:04.081
I've heard all about you.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.444
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I can't say the same.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.749
Well, I'm sure our gal Val
will fill you in.

33:09.787 --> 33:12.449
You see, kid, we were
on a mission last night,

33:12.490 --> 33:14.117
fighting for the forces of good.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.524
But unfortunately,
uh... we lost.

33:16.561 --> 33:18.426
So I noticed.
What happened?

33:18.463 --> 33:20.454
What happened?

33:20.498 --> 33:22.261
Well, apparently
the Duke got wind

33:22.300 --> 33:25.269
of our little sting
through a friend of his wife

33:25.303 --> 33:27.863
and decided to sting us instead.

33:27.905 --> 33:29.099
Well, it worked.

33:29.140 --> 33:30.107
Yeah.

33:30.141 --> 33:31.608
But I'm happy to report

33:31.642 --> 33:33.269
that I got half
the money up front.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.677
Of course, I'm sad to report

33:35.713 --> 33:38.773
that little lady won't be
seeing any of the bonus.

33:38.816 --> 33:41.284
Well, that's all right,

33:41.319 --> 33:43.549
because I already
got my bonus...

33:43.588 --> 33:45.055
a guy who doesn't fade.

33:59.370 --> 34:00.837
Thanks for agreeing
to see me.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.601
Make this quick.
We got a pregame meeting

34:02.640 --> 34:03.607
over at the field.

34:03.641 --> 34:05.040
Okay, I can make it quick.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.567
Look, I just don't want you

34:07.612 --> 34:10.308
or the other guys to be
mad at Joe because of me.

34:10.348 --> 34:11.315
Yeah, sure.

34:11.349 --> 34:12.940
No problem.
See ya.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.109
Please.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.551
I don't think you understand,

34:15.585 --> 34:16.882
and...

34:16.920 --> 34:18.821
I didn't understand
until yesterday.

34:18.856 --> 34:19.880
Understand what?

34:19.924 --> 34:21.858
I don't think Joe told you

34:21.893 --> 34:24.123
the whole story about
what went down Halloween night.

34:24.161 --> 34:25.186
We heard enough.

34:25.228 --> 34:28.460
Look, the night
that Joe broke curfew,

34:28.498 --> 34:30.933
he wasn't partying.

34:30.967 --> 34:33.596
He was protecting me
from an abusive ex-boyfriend.

34:33.638 --> 34:37.665
He was scared
that I was in danger...

34:37.708 --> 34:38.936
and I was.

34:38.976 --> 34:40.568
I'm sorry.

34:40.610 --> 34:41.737
He really should've
said something.

34:41.779 --> 34:43.906
Yeah, well, I think
he was more concerned

34:43.947 --> 34:46.280
about my reputation
than anything else,

34:46.317 --> 34:47.944
and I think that's
the same reason

34:47.985 --> 34:49.953
why he's such a great leader
on the field.

34:49.987 --> 34:51.420
'Cause he's more concerned
about everyone else

34:51.456 --> 34:52.753
than himself. So...

34:52.790 --> 34:54.155
You'll have to forgive her guys.

34:54.192 --> 34:56.820
I think she's laying it
on a little thick.

34:56.860 --> 34:57.885
I don't think so.

34:57.929 --> 34:58.918
A.K.,

34:58.963 --> 35:00.089
you're team captain.

35:00.131 --> 35:01.530
Am I exaggerating about Joe?

35:01.566 --> 35:03.898
No.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.266
I think she's dead on.

35:29.727 --> 35:31.786
All right, Condors!

35:33.498 --> 35:36.934
Okay...

35:36.968 --> 35:39.801
Okay, well, it's game day.

35:41.806 --> 35:42.864
Right on.

35:42.907 --> 35:44.397
The big question

35:44.442 --> 35:47.502
on everybody's lips other than
are we gonna win is...

35:47.545 --> 35:49.479
- Where's Corny?!
- Where's Corny?!

35:49.514 --> 35:51.072
Yeah!

35:51.115 --> 35:52.707
Where's Corny?

35:52.750 --> 35:54.877
Exactly.

35:54.919 --> 35:57.888
So if you'll take a look
at the big screen behind me,

35:57.922 --> 35:59.412
you'll find out.

36:10.568 --> 36:13.264
Not exactly. Uh-uh, uh-uh.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.333
In case you may have heard

36:16.374 --> 36:19.343
that Corny was being paraded
around the S.C.U. campus,

36:19.377 --> 36:20.435
well...

36:21.612 --> 36:23.239
...it's not true.
It's not true.

36:23.281 --> 36:26.216
The real Corny is right here!

36:29.353 --> 36:32.948
All right, let's give it up
for my Condor Commandos!

36:33.057 --> 36:35.890
We've got Clare Arnold.
Stand up, Clare.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.554
We have Kelly Taylor.

36:37.595 --> 36:40.086
We have Assistant
Professor Colin Robbins

36:40.131 --> 36:43.294
and a host of others who didn't
do enough to get singled out.

36:43.334 --> 36:45.825
And Madman Muntz.

36:45.870 --> 36:46.837
Go!

36:46.871 --> 36:48.236
Condors!

36:48.272 --> 36:50.172
- Go!
- Condors!

36:50.208 --> 36:52.870
- Condors!
- Go!

36:52.910 --> 36:55.003
- Go!
- Condors!

36:56.881 --> 36:58.974
All right!

36:59.016 --> 37:00.643
What a catch!

37:00.685 --> 37:03.449
What a start to this
important Pac-10 game.

37:03.487 --> 37:06.115
That 42-yard reception
leaves the Bears

37:06.157 --> 37:08.682
within breathing room
of another touchdown.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.216
It's been four minutes
of football

37:10.261 --> 37:11.922
that the Condor fans
would rather forget,

37:12.029 --> 37:14.395
The whole team is definitely
looking for a wake-up call

37:14.432 --> 37:16.764
that has not come.

37:16.801 --> 37:19.565
And here go the Bears,
first and goal.

37:19.604 --> 37:20.730
The snap...

37:20.771 --> 37:22.398
Kreuscher drifts back to pass.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.603
Look out, there's the Condor's
number 55, A.K. Carson,

37:25.643 --> 37:26.940
bearing down on him.

37:27.044 --> 37:28.102
Kreuscher is sacked!

37:28.145 --> 37:29.305
What a hit.

37:29.347 --> 37:30.575
You got your column?

37:30.615 --> 37:33.948
Yeah, you gave it to me
a couple of days ago.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.111
Really?

37:35.152 --> 37:36.744
What's your lead?

37:36.787 --> 37:38.448
"Friendship sucks."

37:40.558 --> 37:42.685
You're writing about Dylan,
aren't you?

37:45.396 --> 37:47.387
Yeah.

37:56.107 --> 37:59.508
Save a copy for him.

37:59.543 --> 38:01.511
You never know.

38:06.317 --> 38:09.809
Coach Lyons is sending in a play
from the sidelines.

38:09.854 --> 38:10.843
And here we go.

38:10.888 --> 38:12.822
That's fourth and seven.

38:12.857 --> 38:15.155
The Condors are forced to punt.

38:15.192 --> 38:17.422
There's a snap.
The kick's away...

38:17.461 --> 38:18.485
It looks good.

38:18.529 --> 38:20.224
Bears take it
at their own 32.

38:20.264 --> 38:22.664
The Condors have to consider
themselves lucky,

38:22.700 --> 38:23.928
That's the truth.

38:24.001 --> 38:26.469
The whole team looks
lost without Bradley.

38:26.504 --> 38:29.598
The Condor fans
with that Joe Bradley...

38:29.640 --> 38:32.234
Can we, uh, turn off
the game for a second?

38:32.276 --> 38:34.210
There's something I need
to tell you and Mom.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.474
Yeah, sure.

38:41.185 --> 38:44.552
It's about why Joe isn't
playing in the game today,

38:44.588 --> 38:48.820
but more than that,
it's about me and Ray.

38:48.859 --> 38:51.555
I thought I could

38:51.595 --> 38:54.530
avoid telling you guys,
but I have to.

38:54.565 --> 38:57.591
It's kind of like how you had
to tell me your secret, Mom.

38:57.635 --> 39:01.127
Okay, what is it, sweetheart?

39:03.174 --> 39:05.972
Mom... Dad...

39:09.113 --> 39:11.411
this is really hard for me.

39:12.983 --> 39:14.917
There was something
really terrible going on

39:14.985 --> 39:16.543
between me and Ray.

39:18.222 --> 39:20.656
He was hurting me.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.750
What?

39:22.793 --> 39:25.660
You mean, physically?

39:25.696 --> 39:27.186
Yeah.

39:27.231 --> 39:28.095
Oh, Donna.

39:28.132 --> 39:29.292
Look, if you don't mind,

39:29.333 --> 39:30.630
I don't really want to get

39:30.668 --> 39:32.761
into the details.

39:32.803 --> 39:34.896
It's just kind of humiliating.

39:34.939 --> 39:38.807
I just wanted you guys
to know that I'm okay.

39:38.843 --> 39:40.105
Palm Springs.

39:40.144 --> 39:42.271
You didn't fall down
those stairs, did you?

39:42.313 --> 39:44.873
No.

39:44.915 --> 39:47.406
Here I was going on about
how much he loved you.

39:47.451 --> 39:50.784
We couldn't understand
why the two of you

39:50.821 --> 39:52.083
weren't together anymore.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.454
He seemed like such a good kid

39:53.491 --> 39:54.788
all summer long on the boat.

39:54.825 --> 39:57.225
I never would have guessed.

39:57.261 --> 40:00.526
Well, it didn't happen
all the time,

40:00.564 --> 40:03.658
but when it did,
it was kind of bad.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.362
I'm sorry.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.870
It's okay, Mom.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.801
I'm sorry.

40:12.109 --> 40:14.942
Anyway I just...

40:14.979 --> 40:19.177
I wanted you guys to know
why Joe wasn't playing today.

40:19.216 --> 40:22.879
It's because he protected me
when Ray tried to do this again.

40:25.456 --> 40:26.980
And now he might
go to jail for it.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.992
Oh, no,
we're not gonna let that happen.

40:30.027 --> 40:32.655
Donna, we're gonna do
everything we can.

40:32.696 --> 40:35.290
We're gonna stand behind
you and Joe all the way.

40:35.332 --> 40:37.197
Absolutely.

40:37.234 --> 40:38.531
Thank you.

40:38.569 --> 40:40.093
Sweetheart,

40:40.137 --> 40:43.903
I don't want you ever to feel
afraid to tell me anything.

40:43.941 --> 40:47.468
Same goes for you, Mom.

40:47.511 --> 40:49.308
Oh, you.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.951
Nat, I need two mega burgers
and an order of fried zucchini.

41:05.062 --> 41:08.361
Done. Oh, spread the word...
in honor of the 35 points

41:08.399 --> 41:10.060
that the Condors scored
in the second half,

41:10.100 --> 41:12.125
I'm taking 35% off
of everything on the menu.

41:12.169 --> 41:13.568
Nat, what's gotten into you?

41:13.604 --> 41:16.072
I can remember a time,
and it wasn't so long ago,

41:16.106 --> 41:17.630
that everything would be
on the house.

41:17.675 --> 41:19.609
Hey, if I did that
for every C.U. victory

41:19.643 --> 41:21.440
this season, I'd
be out of business.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.310
This team's going
to the Rose Bowl!

41:23.347 --> 41:26.248
Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!

41:26.283 --> 41:28.581
Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl...!

41:28.619 --> 41:31.486
Rose Bowl's a definite
possibility now.

41:31.522 --> 41:32.853
That was a huge win.

41:32.890 --> 41:34.482
I knew those guys
could pull it off.

41:34.525 --> 41:35.753
Yeah, the team wouldn't quit.

41:35.793 --> 41:38.159
Quit? Are you kidding?
They smoked those Bears.

41:38.195 --> 41:41.323
Maybe they play
better with Mac as quarterback.

41:41.365 --> 41:43.265
Well, I wouldn't worry.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.858
I think it's just like
your father says,

41:44.902 --> 41:46.301
things always work out
for the best.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.135
Yeah, well, I hope that
applies to the case, too.

41:51.442 --> 41:53.672
I'm so exhausted,
I need a vacation.

41:53.711 --> 41:56.339
Well, Thanksgiving will
take care of that.

41:56.380 --> 41:59.144
Oh, no, no, no, there'll be no
rest for Steve on Thanksgiving.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.480
We're having dinner
at Casa Walsh.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.281
So, book early, kids.

42:02.319 --> 42:03.411
Count me in.

42:03.454 --> 42:04.546
How about you, Colin?

42:04.588 --> 42:06.055
You up for a little
left-coast feast?

42:06.090 --> 42:07.523
I meant to tell you,
I'm going back

42:07.558 --> 42:08.616
to New York for the holiday.

42:08.659 --> 42:11.389
You are? Well, you're no fun.

42:11.428 --> 42:13.521
You should tell that to Susan.
She's going to New York, too.

42:13.564 --> 42:16.089
Okay, go Big Apple on us.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.964
I think we can get
along without them.

42:18.035 --> 42:19.127
Do you think we can?

42:20.170 --> 42:22.161
I think we can.

42:22.206 --> 42:25.505
Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!

42:25.543 --> 42:28.671
Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl!

42:28.712 --> 42:32.614
Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!

42:32.650 --> 42:36.381
Rose Bowl! Rose Bowl!
Rose Bowl, Rose Bowl...!

42:46.430 --> 42:49.399
You know, you haven't
asked me a single question

42:49.433 --> 42:50.764
about what happened.

42:54.104 --> 42:57.972
I uh, don't really
care anymore.

43:03.614 --> 43:06.879
You're the only one
who believes in me.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.345
And I always will.
