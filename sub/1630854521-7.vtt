WEBVTT

00:58.851 --> 00:59.852
Fuck!

01:15.284 --> 01:17.411
Move!

01:18.162 --> 01:19.705
I know what you've done.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.999
- Hey!
- I know what you've done.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.460
- I know. I know...
- Come on.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.170
...what you've done.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.172
You all know, don't you?

01:28.422 --> 01:29.799
You're all in on this!

01:29.924 --> 01:30.925
Everyone.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.011
I know your secrets.

01:35.221 --> 01:39.225
Yeah. You're gonna pay for this.
This is not over yet.

01:39.225 --> 01:42.228
You hear me?
You're all going to pay for this.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.400
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:35.573 --> 02:36.615
You okay?

02:39.702 --> 02:41.954
I was thinking about when I was a kid.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.292
<i>There were all these birds
in our backyard.</i>

02:46.292 --> 02:47.960
<i>Mom had gone. They were all on their own.</i>

02:49.169 --> 02:52.923
Just like you as a child,
you were left all alone.

02:53.591 --> 02:54.884
Well, they were dead.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.095
<i>They couldn't survive without her.</i>

02:58.429 --> 03:00.347
<i>Maybe you.</i>

03:00.347 --> 03:03.475
<i>There's a part of you that died, too.</i>

03:03.475 --> 03:06.228
That couldn't survive
without your parents.

03:10.733 --> 03:14.111
These memories coming back up,
I know they're upsetting.

03:14.987 --> 03:20.743
<i>But whatever your subconscious
is trying to tell you, it will come.</i>

03:22.995 --> 03:24.288
Don't force it.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.251
You are right.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.877
Look what we have here, a little squirrel.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.629
You're all still out here.

04:57.131 --> 05:01.135
- We won't stop until we find her.
- We already searched this stretch.

05:01.135 --> 05:06.223
It could take a year or more
to cover this whole forest.

05:06.223 --> 05:09.685
Be out here the rest of my days
if that's what it takes.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.186
It won't take that long.

05:11.186 --> 05:14.356
Kevin said they were pulled up
that way on Pine Ridge

05:14.356 --> 05:16.650
and that's where he heard the gunshots.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.404
- Did he say anything else?
- I'm sorry.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.781
- I wish he had.
- If he hadn't wound up dead,

05:22.781 --> 05:25.659
he could have pointed us
in the right direction.

05:25.659 --> 05:29.163
- There's an ongoing inquiry.
- I won't hold my breath.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.791
When we find them, we will get justice.

05:33.500 --> 05:37.296
Right? For Blue, Tommy
and Kevin, honey. Okay?

05:37.296 --> 05:41.759
So if your search takes you off
Iotenen'tón:ni, you're in SQ jurisdiction.

05:41.759 --> 05:44.511
- You're saying we can't search out there?
- No.

05:44.511 --> 05:48.515
No, I'm saying that maybe our search
wasn't thorough enough.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.060
- Wow.
- I could get you some help.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.397
- I'll talk to my boss.
- Okay.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.025
I will hold you to that, Lacoste.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.617
Hey, come here!

06:06.742 --> 06:08.786
- You find something?
- Come here!

06:11.622 --> 06:13.207
Stay back. Is it them?

06:13.207 --> 06:14.833
- Go home.
- Don't look.

06:14.833 --> 06:15.959
Except for you.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.753
- You stay.
- Don't look.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.339
Keep out of here
until the scene's cleared.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.382
It might take a couple days.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.553
- Don't look.
- I'm going to need backup and an ambulance

06:26.553 --> 06:30.307
just off of Pine Ridge Road,
three miles east of Iotenen'tón:ni.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.184
A suspected suicide.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.354
I'll send you the coordinates now.

06:35.354 --> 06:37.064
I think you got that wrong.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.983
It doesn't look like suicide.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.402
More than one set of footprints.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.762
<i>- Merci.</i>
- No Jean-Guy?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.889
Taking some time with Enid.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.642
I spoke to him yesterday.
He sounded cheerful.

07:13.642 --> 07:16.562
They're about to take a ferry
across Lake Champlain.

07:16.562 --> 07:17.688
Sounds fun.

07:20.816 --> 07:23.652
- So, when was he found?
- A couple of hours ago.

07:24.486 --> 07:28.407
He's been dead 10, maybe 12 hours,
by the look of it.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.451
- He was found just over there.
- Oh.

07:42.921 --> 07:43.922
Mmm.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.801
What a place to end a life.

07:48.594 --> 07:49.803
It's so beautiful.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.910
- Did you ever climb trees?
- Sure.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.454
Still do with my girls.

08:15.454 --> 08:19.666
These are not the hands of someone
who climbed up there. Too clean.

08:22.544 --> 08:27.549
And these thumbprints, they seem more like
a manual strangulation than a hanging.

08:28.550 --> 08:32.888
Well, maybe he was strangled
and then strung up to look like a suicide?

08:33.388 --> 08:35.766
There's multiple tracks around the tree.

08:35.766 --> 08:37.267
Do we know who he is?

08:37.643 --> 08:41.271
No wallet, no cell phone,
his pockets were empty.

08:41.271 --> 08:44.483
Get a photo circulated,
maybe we can get an ID.

09:02.084 --> 09:04.836
Do you know anything about pine trees?

09:04.836 --> 09:06.546
These needles seem...

09:07.589 --> 09:08.924
unusually long.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.342
Maybe Bea does.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.182
Been a while, Chief.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.643
You keeping well, Bea?

09:20.769 --> 09:22.688
Well as I can.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.482
You know who he is?

09:25.482 --> 09:27.818
No, I'm sorry. I don't.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.611
You know about pines.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.864
- They're all the same here, right?
- Yeah, pretty much.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.617
- Mostly red pine.
- Hmm.

09:35.617 --> 09:39.913
So what are these ones called
with the longer needles?

09:40.664 --> 09:42.040
Those are white pine.

09:43.917 --> 09:47.921
Their bark is paler,
and I've seen white pines around here,

09:47.921 --> 09:52.843
but there can't be more
than a handful in the whole Pine Ridge.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.345
Mmm. Thank you.

09:56.972 --> 09:59.349
- You want to show me those tracks?
- Sure.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.270
Here.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.940
Any chance
these belong to the search party?

10:06.940 --> 10:08.775
No, not from today.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.653
We stopped them all
before they got to the tree.

10:11.653 --> 10:15.240
It rained last night,
so I'm guessing these were made then.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.784
Show me where they're headed.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.081
Any word on ID'ing
who was driving a patrol car?

10:23.081 --> 10:24.207
I checked.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.544
An SQ traffic cop
named Dan Chowski was here

10:27.544 --> 10:29.713
the day Tommy and Blue disappeared.

10:29.713 --> 10:32.716
You know him? No? Me neither.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.927
- When can we talk to him?
- Apparently, he's gone AWOL.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.638
- No one's seen him for a week.
- Convenient.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.349
I think he was tipped off.

10:42.434 --> 10:46.355
You think the inquiry into Kevin's death
is going to get near the truth?

10:46.355 --> 10:48.648
Someone at the Department of Corrections

10:48.648 --> 10:52.152
told me that everything points
to a self-administered OD.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.199
Kevin sold black market cigarettes.
He wasn't a drug user.

10:58.492 --> 11:02.204
- Chowski must have gotten to him.
- No, he wasn't acting alone.

11:02.788 --> 11:07.584
But you, you have to stop
blaming yourself for Kevin's death.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.420
Who else should I blame?

11:11.171 --> 11:14.091
I promised him he'd be safe
if I took him in.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.012
Hmm.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.349
You really think Tommy and Blue
are out here?

11:24.059 --> 11:25.018
It makes sense.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.564
We need to get the Two-Rivers some help.

11:29.564 --> 11:34.194
I think we should go over it again,
expand the search area a little wider.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.031
Hmm.

11:38.657 --> 11:41.159
As long as Francoeur
doesn't hear about it.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.788
The tracks stop there.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.836
This is where they disappear.
Right here.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.546
What is it with this place?

11:53.046 --> 11:57.342
We're looking for two dead bodies
and there's a third hanging from a tree.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.678
So we're looking for a lynch mob?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.513
We're looking for a reason.

12:44.347 --> 12:48.185
It takes a lot for a group
to come together to end a man's life.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.895
He must have done something bad.

12:49.895 --> 12:52.063
We got to figure out who he is.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.817
Hey, stranger.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.486
I heard you were back in town.

12:57.486 --> 13:00.113
Clara. What a lovely surprise.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.575
Gabri just baked your favourite.
They're still warm.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.702
- Is that what I think they are?
- Mmm.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.581
Mmm!
Thank you. That's very kind.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.794
I presume you know why we are here.

13:15.962 --> 13:19.257
- This might be distressing. Do you mind?
- No, of course.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.346
Oh, my God.

13:24.763 --> 13:25.972
Do you know him?

13:27.015 --> 13:30.769
Not by name, but he did some damage
in the Bistro last night.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.604
How so?

13:32.604 --> 13:33.980
Had a few too many.

13:34.606 --> 13:37.192
He came in spoiling for a fight.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.611
Took Peter and Mike to hold him down.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.738
Do you know where he lived?

13:42.447 --> 13:44.783
He'd only been in town a few days.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.911
He was staying at the B

13:48.203 --> 13:49.246
Let's go.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.376
You mean, like, now?

13:55.919 --> 13:56.795
Okay.

13:58.713 --> 13:59.756
Mmm.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.361
Hi, Ruth.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.030
Assholes.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.882
Angela.

14:43.425 --> 14:46.386
Chief Inspector, what brings you back?

14:46.386 --> 14:51.266
Well, we're here about one of your guests,
a gentleman in his 50s.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.144
Arthur Ellis?

14:55.353 --> 14:58.273
- He's the only male guest.
- You checked him in?

14:58.273 --> 15:01.901
Yes, on Sunday night,
and he checks out next Monday.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.571
- Paid cash for the whole week.
- Is that unusual?

15:04.571 --> 15:08.992
Most guests only stay a night or two
and nobody pays cash these days.

15:08.992 --> 15:12.245
Did he have any guests?
Take anyone up to his room?

15:12.245 --> 15:14.080
Not that I'm aware of.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.499
Do you have any cameras?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.877
Our guests value their privacy.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.421
Did Mr. Ellis say why he was here?

15:26.635 --> 15:28.762
I'm sorry. I don't recall.

15:30.096 --> 15:33.725
He did ask for the quietest room,
so he wouldn't be disturbed.

15:33.725 --> 15:34.934
He explained why?

15:35.060 --> 15:39.981
I assumed maybe he has trouble sleeping,
or maybe he's just a very private person.

15:40.482 --> 15:43.109
- Is he in some kind of trouble?
- Big trouble.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.111
Dead?

15:46.196 --> 15:47.030
How?

15:48.198 --> 15:52.285
- Was it an accident?
- No. He was found in the forest. Hanged.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.247
Suicide?

15:57.749 --> 15:59.668
My God, that is awful.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.252
May we see his room?

16:06.049 --> 16:09.135
- It's right at the top, in the loft.
- Thank you.

16:52.512 --> 16:56.182
He didn't pack enough for a week.
Three days at the most.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.685
Maybe he didn't change
his clothes too often.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.186
Some people are pigs.

17:00.186 --> 17:04.607
Pigs don't wear suits outside of work
or leave rooms this neat.

17:04.607 --> 17:07.277
No wallet. No cell phone.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.737
Not on him. Not here.

17:08.737 --> 17:12.657
Maybe the killers emptied
his pockets before they strung him up?

17:12.657 --> 17:15.201
Have SIJ process the room.

17:15.201 --> 17:18.413
Agent Nichol,
did you check the bed thoroughly?

17:18.413 --> 17:20.582
- Yes, sir. Every nook and cranny.
- Mm-hmm.

17:22.292 --> 17:23.668
So what is that?

17:25.253 --> 17:26.254
Oh...

17:26.254 --> 17:27.505
It's...

17:29.632 --> 17:30.592
I'm sorry.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.770
"My work is finally done.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.773
"Sometimes vengeance
is the only path to peace.

17:45.732 --> 17:49.402
"I know you cannot forgive me,
but perhaps you can understand."

17:49.402 --> 17:51.362
That reads like a suicide note.

17:52.906 --> 17:53.907
Can we be wrong?

17:55.158 --> 17:57.118
You've seen suicide notes before.

17:57.118 --> 18:00.872
Shaky handwriting, ink smudged with tears.
This is too neat.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.501
Somebody wrote this to stage a suicide.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.756
- Is it true? Is he really dead?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.758
I can't believe it.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.970
We heard there was
some sort of altercation last night.

18:16.304 --> 18:19.516
Ellis was drunk,
upsetting my customers, mouthing off.

18:19.516 --> 18:20.642
About what?

18:21.059 --> 18:24.062
None of it made any sense,
just drunk and angry.

18:24.062 --> 18:25.772
Who was his anger aimed at?

18:27.440 --> 18:28.858
Anyone in his path.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.278
Path to vengeance...

18:33.112 --> 18:34.030
What?

18:36.074 --> 18:37.575
I have to take this.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.704
Get a list of everyone
who was at the Bistro last night.

18:48.545 --> 18:49.379
Mmm.

18:52.507 --> 18:55.969
Pierre, at last.
I was beginning to worry about you.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.304
<i>I'm sorry. It's been one hell of a week.</i>

18:59.180 --> 19:02.684
Listen. I heard Lacoste found a suicide
at the Pine Ridge.

19:02.684 --> 19:03.977
Not a suicide.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.062
<i>- No?</i>
- Homicide.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.314
Homicide? Geez.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.526
- Any news on Chowski?
- Nothing. I checked with his folks.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.194
They haven't heard from him.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.488
<i>I called all his buddies and I got zip.</i>

19:15.488 --> 19:17.365
You think something's happened?

19:17.365 --> 19:21.244
I think he heard you were asking about him
and took off.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.705
That makes him look pretty guilty.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.999
Well, yeah, his work file is clean.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.293
But I did some digging.

19:29.627 --> 19:33.548
There was an incident, he shot
an unarmed man during a drug arrest.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.842
The guy survived. Chowski was cleared.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.594
He's trigger-happy.

19:37.594 --> 19:41.431
<i>Could be he got scared his history's
going to put him in the frame.</i>

19:41.431 --> 19:43.725
We can't be blindsided here.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.602
Kevin Kis was no angel.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.021
I still think there's a chance
he's involved.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.814
<i>I appreciate that, Pierre.</i>

19:50.607 --> 19:54.485
Oh, Kevin said that there were
two officers in the car.

19:54.485 --> 19:57.322
Do you know who was riding with Chowski?

19:57.322 --> 20:00.450
<i>No. He was down to ride solo, so...</i>

20:00.450 --> 20:02.452
Maybe it wasn't another cop.

20:03.328 --> 20:05.538
I'll ask around, see what I can find.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.248
Thanks, Pierre.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.884
We're not open yet.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.845
Good day, Chief Inspector.

20:20.845 --> 20:21.971
<i>Bonjour.</i>

20:23.389 --> 20:26.059
- That looks painful.
- Oh, it's nothing.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.644
Did it happen last night?

20:28.811 --> 20:30.396
So Mr. Ellis went for you.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.192
One too many tequilas.
Comes with the territory.

20:34.192 --> 20:35.443
You get some drunk

20:35.443 --> 20:38.571
who doesn't like the toasted almonds.

20:38.571 --> 20:42.742
Did he object to anything else
besides the toasted almonds?

20:42.742 --> 20:45.495
I don't know,
he was going on about secrets.

20:45.495 --> 20:48.247
I kind of tuned out after he punched me.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.791
No, I understand.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.252
Thank you.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.507
Wanna come back for lunch?
I'll make your favourite.

20:57.632 --> 20:58.633
Mmm.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.273
Why was Ellis upset with you?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.525
He was crazy, you saw him.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.694
I was just the nearest target.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.780
What was he doing
in your office yesterday morning?

21:20.905 --> 21:22.699
I saw you,
I heard you fighting.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.742
What was it about?

21:25.243 --> 21:26.244
It was nothing.

21:28.413 --> 21:29.372
Do you know him?

21:30.373 --> 21:32.792
Did you know him
before he came here?

21:33.167 --> 21:35.211
He seemed really angry with you--

21:35.211 --> 21:37.463
What exactly are you accusing me of?

21:39.507 --> 21:42.301
We've never kept secrets
from each other before.

22:18.171 --> 22:21.466
<i>Hi! You've reached Enid. I'm unavailable.
Please leave a message. Thank you.</i>

22:27.263 --> 22:29.974
- You know how she got that name.
- I don't.

22:29.974 --> 22:33.019
She was at bingo, and she needs I-29...

22:33.019 --> 22:34.937
- I-29...
- Shit.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.857
Let's see what they want.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.278
Sergeant Lacoste called in a favour.

22:42.278 --> 22:45.573
They've got plenty of experience
running ground search.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.366
They can look with fresh eyes.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.912
You've got them for two weeks.
It's the best I could do.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.289
Appreciate it.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.708
Let's get started.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.673
So what's your name, officer?

23:02.673 --> 23:04.175
- Juliet.
- Juliet.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.686
Jean-Guy? How's it going?

23:16.354 --> 23:19.899
We just got back a couple hours ago.
She's in the kitchen.

23:19.899 --> 23:23.778
- She's cooking her famous shrimp linguini.
- Oh, that's great.

23:24.737 --> 23:29.700
Yeah, well, now that everything is sorted,
I think I'm ready to come back to work.

23:29.700 --> 23:32.537
Wonderful. That's wonderful, Jean-Guy.

23:32.537 --> 23:33.788
Okay, well...

23:35.665 --> 23:38.167
- Have a good evening.
<i>- You, too.</i>

24:03.734 --> 24:05.987
This is everyone who was at the Bistro

24:05.987 --> 24:09.407
when Ellis freaked out on Gabri.
They all said the same thing.

24:09.407 --> 24:14.203
Ellis was drunk, he told the town
he knew their darkest secrets.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.664
They all had the same scripts.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.833
Gabri told me the exact same thing.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.461
Maybe they got their stories
straight together.

24:22.461 --> 24:26.465
Ellis freaks out at the Bistro,
threatens to reveal their secrets.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.885
The next day, he's dead.

24:29.844 --> 24:32.555
Which means someone has
a secret worth protecting.

24:32.555 --> 24:34.974
And a whole lot of help protecting it.

24:36.392 --> 24:39.520
I can't find an Arthur Ellis
matching the description

24:39.520 --> 24:41.689
anywhere in the official records.

24:42.190 --> 24:46.569
Angela mentioned that he paid cash,
so maybe he was living under the radar.

24:48.362 --> 24:49.238
Anyway.

24:49.238 --> 24:53.326
Olivier said he had a rental car
and I found it parked up the street.

24:53.784 --> 24:56.078
Here's a copy of the rental agreement.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.289
He gave an address in Ottawa.

25:02.877 --> 25:04.587
Handwriting's exactly the same.

25:05.379 --> 25:08.257
Which means Ellis wrote
the suicide note himself.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.927
How do you write so neatly under duress?

25:13.054 --> 25:15.973
I'll call Ottawa,
get them to look into this address.

25:20.895 --> 25:24.565
Isabelle, when SIJ processed
Kevin's place,

25:24.565 --> 25:28.110
they found pine needles
under the floorboards, right?

25:28.110 --> 25:30.947
There's pine trees
all round Iotenen'tón:ni.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.865
The needles get stuck in the boards.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.910
It'd be tough to find an old house
that doesn't have them.

25:35.910 --> 25:38.663
But were they identified? The exact type?

25:39.413 --> 25:43.626
I don't know. I mean, we didn't ask.
It didn't feel relevant.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.797
- Is it relevant?
- I don't know.

25:48.381 --> 25:49.882
Perhaps.

25:51.884 --> 25:55.137
Could you get them out of evidence?
Get them identified.

25:56.264 --> 25:57.265
Sure.

26:06.315 --> 26:10.569
<i>"And it was then
that she knew, without any doubt at all,</i>

26:10.569 --> 26:13.155
"that they had done the right thing.

26:13.155 --> 26:17.493
"That whatever secrets lay there
rotting in the ground beneath their feet,

26:17.493 --> 26:21.622
"that they would disappear altogether
in less than 100 years.

26:21.622 --> 26:27.461
"And by that time,
no one would even remember his name."

26:30.506 --> 26:33.384
If you ask me,
she was justified in killing him.

26:34.885 --> 26:37.305
I'd have cut that fucker a new asshole.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.892
No one is ever justified in the taking
of a human life.

26:41.892 --> 26:44.353
After what he did, are you kidding me?

26:44.353 --> 26:46.272
She could have gone to the courts.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.732
Like that always happens.

26:47.732 --> 26:50.526
You have to take matters
into your own hands.

26:50.526 --> 26:53.696
I had no idea he was pro-vigilantism
when I married him.

26:53.696 --> 26:56.741
You better watch your back
after an argument.

26:56.741 --> 26:59.660
Those guys got access
to a bunch of sharp knives.

26:59.660 --> 27:03.289
I keep a first aid kit in every room
in the house, just in case.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.126
You think it's funny?

27:07.126 --> 27:08.419
To joke about these things?

27:08.419 --> 27:10.629
You carry on, but I'm leaving.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.881
Gabri, come on.

27:11.881 --> 27:13.966
We're just messing with you.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.720
- Let's just wrap this up.
- But we haven't voted yet.

27:18.804 --> 27:23.976
Hands up if you think murder is justified
if the circumstances are right.

27:27.521 --> 27:29.523
You're with us, aren't you, Angela?

27:30.649 --> 27:33.527
- Well, I--
- Who cares? It's just a story.

27:33.527 --> 27:37.156
- Don't take it so damn seriously.
- So much for fucking sisterhood.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.994
Honestly, I thought the whole premise
was kind of lame.

27:41.994 --> 27:45.414
Like every man she meets
is a rapist or a psychopath.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.834
- Come on.
- You want to hashtag that?

27:48.834 --> 27:51.379
-"Not all men."
- Well, yeah, I would--

27:51.379 --> 27:54.965
Guys, come on.
What's next month's book, Myrna?

27:54.965 --> 27:57.593
It's biography month, so...

27:59.345 --> 28:02.014
- Hand them around.
- Thank you.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.557
- Wow.
- Biography, huh?

28:03.557 --> 28:04.683
<i>The Hangman?</i>

28:16.862 --> 28:18.072
Ooh.

28:18.489 --> 28:19.532
I'm stuffed.

28:19.532 --> 28:21.534
- So good.
- Yeah, not bad.

28:21.951 --> 28:24.036
I want a deuxieme creme brulee though.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.622
I'm not sure we can eat like that
every night.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.707
Chief Inspector! Chief Inspector.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.213
I don't know why I didn't notice before.

28:35.089 --> 28:35.923
<i>Hangman?</i>

28:35.923 --> 28:39.051
We're reading it for Book Club
next month. Right there.

28:39.051 --> 28:43.180
Maybe it's just a coincidence.
But that was his name, wasn't it?

28:44.098 --> 28:47.601
Arthur Ellis, the man you found hanging.

28:51.313 --> 28:52.231
Thank you.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.946
Arthur Ellis was Canada's
official executioner.

28:58.946 --> 29:01.115
He hanged people, over 600 of them.

29:01.115 --> 29:03.284
- Are you kidding me?
- Listen to this.

29:03.284 --> 29:06.328
Arthur Ellis wasn't his real name,
it was a pseudonym.

29:07.788 --> 29:11.750
And he came from a long line
of executioners from England.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.337
And his family had been hanging people
for over 300 years.

29:15.337 --> 29:18.466
And they knew
people feared the executioner.

29:18.466 --> 29:22.720
They wanted the job done,
but they didn't want to know the person.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.806
So the family used a pseudonym
to protect themselves?

29:25.806 --> 29:27.016
Exactly.

29:27.016 --> 29:31.353
You know, Arthur Ellis was successful
until he made a mistake.

29:31.937 --> 29:34.607
In 1935,
he guessed a woman's weight wrong.

29:35.191 --> 29:38.152
She killed him? That's harsh.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.696
No, he miscalculated
the length of the rope

29:40.696 --> 29:43.824
and took Tommasina Teolis' head clean off.

29:43.824 --> 29:47.161
It caused a huge public outcry,
ruined his career.

29:47.578 --> 29:50.539
He died in Montreal three years later.
A broken man.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.919
So maybe our Arthur Ellis
used the hangman pseudonym too?

29:54.919 --> 29:58.714
To deliver a death penalty
to someone who'd wronged him.

29:58.714 --> 30:01.759
"Sometimes vengeance
is the only path to peace."

30:04.303 --> 30:08.307
Do you think he tried to get revenge
on someone here in Three Pines?

30:09.308 --> 30:11.185
What are you doing, Agent Nichol?

30:11.894 --> 30:12.853
Cat's cradle.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.109
It is hard. It's harder than it looks.

30:20.277 --> 30:25.616
So Ellis came to Three Pines
looking for someone, intent on vengeance.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.828
I think the intended victim knew
and got to him first.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.039
So we find out who he really is.

30:32.039 --> 30:34.875
- Dig up his past.
- And we'll find the killer.

30:34.875 --> 30:38.045
Who must have forced him
to write the suicide note.

30:38.796 --> 30:39.922
I think so.

31:25.968 --> 31:28.929
- <i>I'm frightened.</i>
- Of what?

31:31.390 --> 31:32.224
My heart?

31:32.474 --> 31:35.352
I haven't felt like this
in a long time.

31:36.729 --> 31:37.730
Tell me.

31:38.814 --> 31:39.982
What are you feeling?

31:42.443 --> 31:43.360
Confused.

31:47.281 --> 31:48.115
Alone.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.451
You're never alone.

31:51.285 --> 31:53.078
Not as long as my heart beats.

31:58.542 --> 31:59.793
<i>You felt this before?</i>

32:01.545 --> 32:02.379
Yeah.

32:05.424 --> 32:06.884
When my parents died.

32:10.054 --> 32:11.555
<i>Hmm.</i>

32:14.266 --> 32:15.267
You know...

32:16.518 --> 32:20.814
What happened to that little boy
made him into the man I love.

32:22.316 --> 32:25.027
<i>Your pain, your grief...</i>

32:25.027 --> 32:30.199
<i>It gave you your compassion.
It made you fight for others</i>

32:30.324 --> 32:34.453
<i>that have felt it, too. It's who you are.</i>

32:40.084 --> 32:44.838
Do you remember when you were at Cambridge

32:44.838 --> 32:48.509
<i>and I was in Toronto
and we used to spend all our money</i>

32:48.509 --> 32:50.135
<i>on long distance phone calls?</i>

32:53.013 --> 32:56.392
When one of us couldn't sleep
and we just left the line open

32:56.392 --> 32:58.686
<i>so we could be there for each other.</i>

33:00.521 --> 33:02.106
<i>Want me to stay with you?</i>

33:03.607 --> 33:04.650
<i>So you can sleep?</i>

33:06.985 --> 33:07.861
I do.

33:10.239 --> 33:11.782
It's cheaper now, so...

33:16.787 --> 33:19.331
It's cheaper now.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.127
Let's do this.

33:27.214 --> 33:30.801
<i>Close your eyes, honey. Sleep.</i>

33:33.220 --> 33:34.805
Sleep, Armand. Sleep.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.057
<i>Sleep.</i>

34:36.283 --> 34:39.369
<i>Today I'm going to show you
how to identify a pine tree.</i>

34:39.369 --> 34:43.957
<i>Now, there are many species of pines,
115 to be precise.</i>

34:43.957 --> 34:45.918
<i>But by learning a few techniques,</i>

34:45.918 --> 34:49.630
<i>you will be able to distinguish them
from other conifers.</i>

34:51.048 --> 34:52.758
- You're up early.
- Hmm.

34:54.301 --> 34:57.179
You're looking tired, Chief.
Not sleeping so good?

34:57.596 --> 34:58.806
Something like that.

35:01.308 --> 35:05.354
I saw the new installation,
the red dresses.

35:06.480 --> 35:12.277
Yeah, each and every one represents
a missing Indigenous woman or girl.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.196
It's humbling.

35:15.489 --> 35:17.950
Is that what's keeping you awake at night?

35:17.950 --> 35:19.993
Blue Two-Rivers?

35:21.078 --> 35:22.913
Blue and other things.

35:25.624 --> 35:29.753
Everything's connected,
one way or the other.

36:01.577 --> 36:02.911
<i>Patron.</i>

36:02.911 --> 36:06.373
The pine needles found
at Kevin's place, they're white pine.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.457
Are you sure?

36:07.457 --> 36:09.668
- Lab confirmed it.
- Excellent.

36:11.920 --> 36:15.924
White pines were probably walked in
by the killers of Tommy and Blue,

36:15.924 --> 36:19.428
which means that they're buried
near some white pine trees.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.471
That could be anywhere along the ridge.

36:21.471 --> 36:24.182
Except that white pine
is unusual in this area.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.310
There's just a handful in this forest.

36:26.310 --> 36:30.063
According to Bea,
they're concentrated in this area.

36:30.063 --> 36:33.066
Was this area checked
by the search parties?

36:33.775 --> 36:34.693
No.

36:35.861 --> 36:36.778
It wasn't.

36:37.154 --> 36:40.866
Call Arisawe and the others.
Let's get them searching the right area.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.243
- Meanwhile, I'll get started.
- Okay.

38:57.210 --> 38:59.463
We should call the Two-Rivers.

39:01.256 --> 39:02.174
Isabelle?

39:06.845 --> 39:07.763
Isabelle.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.224
We should call the Two-Rivers.

39:12.225 --> 39:14.227
Stop them before they head back out.

40:20.919 --> 40:21.920
You okay?

40:29.136 --> 40:30.720
Any news on the IDs?

40:32.222 --> 40:34.683
Both sets of dental records were a match.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.269
It's Blue and Tommy.

40:39.396 --> 40:41.690
I found more bullets at the scene.

40:42.732 --> 40:44.818
The striations are pretty distinctive.

40:44.818 --> 40:46.194
Police issue.

40:50.031 --> 40:52.576
Ballistics might be able to tell us
whose gun they came from.

40:54.578 --> 40:55.662
You still have them?

40:55.662 --> 40:57.998
I didn't think it was wise to hand them

40:57.998 --> 41:00.959
to SQ ballistics
until we know who we can trust.

41:04.254 --> 41:06.965
<i>First bullet I found
must have killed Tommy.</i>

41:07.924 --> 41:12.179
<i>The pathologist thinks it hit soft tissue,
but can't say exactly where.</i>

41:13.555 --> 41:16.224
<i>Blue had a bullet
in the back of her skull.</i>

41:17.559 --> 41:19.269
<i>So she was running away.</i>

41:21.730 --> 41:22.647
<i>She was.</i>

41:34.743 --> 41:35.744
Here we go.

41:51.968 --> 41:52.928
Is it them?

41:53.261 --> 41:54.221
Oh...

41:54.221 --> 41:55.388
There's no doubt.

41:59.643 --> 42:01.561
Come in.

42:01.561 --> 42:02.520
It's them.

42:02.938 --> 42:04.522
It was them.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.280
Come here, sweety.

42:14.241 --> 42:16.034
Oh, my baby.

42:18.578 --> 42:20.288
So when do we get her back?

42:20.288 --> 42:23.500
Well, there are bullets
that need to be analyzed first.

42:24.709 --> 42:28.171
Are those bullets going to tell us
which cop killed her?

42:28.171 --> 42:31.758
It's possible that we can trace them
back to the gun,

42:31.758 --> 42:33.176
if it's police issue.

42:33.176 --> 42:37.973
Well, I want my granddaughter back
so we can lay her to rest.

42:38.932 --> 42:43.311
And after you bring her back to us
and Blue's killers are behind bars,

42:43.311 --> 42:44.646
your work is done.

42:44.646 --> 42:48.900
We're going to find who did this to her
and we're going to make them pay.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.110
You can count on it.

42:56.241 --> 42:57.158
My baby.

43:13.049 --> 43:15.760
This was never gonna work out
the way we'd hoped.

43:19.264 --> 43:20.640
But you never gave up.

43:21.641 --> 43:24.644
We brought Blue back to them,
which is something.

43:24.644 --> 43:27.856
Finding Blue and Tommy
is just the start of it.

43:27.856 --> 43:30.525
At least now we've got
something to work on,

43:30.525 --> 43:32.360
help us find their killer.

43:37.615 --> 43:38.533
Hello.

43:38.533 --> 43:39.784
<i>Lacoste.</i>

43:39.784 --> 43:42.912
The address on
the car rental forms was a dud.

43:42.912 --> 43:45.373
But there was a tracker on the car.

43:45.373 --> 43:48.793
<i>It had Ellis driving for two days
before he came here.</i>

43:48.793 --> 43:51.796
Kept returning to the same point,
an apartment in Ottawa.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.090
<i>Well, I'll ping you the address, okay?</i>

43:54.090 --> 43:55.300
Okay.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.968
- Thanks.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

43:58.011 --> 44:01.556
Why don't you check it out,
just in case Nichol screws it up?

44:01.556 --> 44:04.267
How long do you think
ballistics will take?

44:04.267 --> 44:05.810
I called in a favour.

44:05.810 --> 44:08.355
He's running it through a private lab.

44:08.355 --> 44:10.982
Do you think it'll trace back
to Chowski's gun?

44:13.234 --> 44:14.778
I'm sure of it.

46:45.803 --> 46:46.846
Isabelle?

46:46.846 --> 46:50.475
His real name is James Hill.
He packed up his whole apartment.

46:50.475 --> 46:52.560
He wasn't planning on coming back.

46:52.560 --> 46:55.605
- Did you find anything significant?
- He had a family.

46:55.605 --> 46:57.398
He had a wife, a daughter.

46:57.398 --> 47:01.027
His neighbour said
he'd been living alone for years.

47:01.027 --> 47:03.530
Maybe the wife left him, took the kid?

47:03.530 --> 47:06.491
And left half of their possessions behind?

47:06.866 --> 47:08.660
<i>Something's not right.</i>

47:08.660 --> 47:10.745
What if the suicide note was genuine?

47:11.246 --> 47:15.124
Perhaps Hill was planning to take
his own life before he was murdered.

47:15.124 --> 47:17.460
Maybe. I don't know.

47:17.460 --> 47:19.212
We need to track down his family.

47:19.212 --> 47:20.421
I'll get on it.

47:21.631 --> 47:23.424
How about you? Any news?

47:23.424 --> 47:26.302
I heard from my friend.
The bullets are a match.

47:27.679 --> 47:31.933
I didn't want them to email it,
so I'm driving back to the city.

47:32.684 --> 47:35.478
He's going to meet me at nine.
Can you meet me then?

47:36.104 --> 47:38.731
Yeah, sure. Just text me the address.

47:38.731 --> 47:40.858
<i>See you later. Bye.</i>

48:44.047 --> 48:45.006
Well?

48:48.635 --> 48:52.221
Based on analysis of bullets
fired in other cases,

48:53.514 --> 48:56.768
he traced the markings back
to two different guns,

48:56.768 --> 48:59.479
both registered to Sûreté officers.

48:59.479 --> 49:00.480
Shit.

49:02.982 --> 49:06.944
Their names and badge numbers
are in here with the report.

49:06.944 --> 49:09.530
Are either of the guns lost or stolen?

49:17.121 --> 49:18.289
What does it say?

49:24.212 --> 49:27.799
"Bullet number one fired from
firearm number one

49:27.799 --> 49:32.303
"into male victim,
registered to Daniel Chowski.

49:38.893 --> 49:41.104
"Bullet number two and Bullet number three

49:41.104 --> 49:46.526
"fired from firearm number two
into female victim, registered--"

49:51.614 --> 49:53.116
Well?

50:03.626 --> 50:08.339
"Firearm two registered to
Chief Inspector Pierre Arnot."
