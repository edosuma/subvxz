02:59.970 --> 03:02.280
Look, I know you
and your father weren't close.

03:04.280 --> 03:08.180

03:08.380 --> 03:10.950
losing a parent you had
a complicated relationship with

03:11.150 --> 03:12.640
can be just as difficult--

03:12.840 --> 03:14.120
It wasn't "complicated,"
it was nonexistent.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.810
But this is very important.

05:02.150 --> 05:04.160
Since when do you have
passports for us?

05:04.360 --> 05:08.130
Since the moment you told me
what you were involved in here.

05:08.330 --> 05:09.930

05:10.130 --> 05:12.440
that I'd agree to any of this
without an exit plan?
