00:04.100 --> 00:06.280
- What happened?
- BUCKLEY: Kane got out.

00:06.480 --> 00:07.490
Place was a bloodbath.

00:07.690 --> 00:08.630
Bodies on top of bodies.

00:08.830 --> 00:09.800
So how the fuck did they miss?

00:10.000 --> 00:11.280
It was Franklin.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.800
<i>Pulled Kane out.</i>

00:13.000 --> 00:15.010
[yelling] Ah, shit!

00:15.210 --> 00:18.460
You know, Frankie, you know what
shit I want to take care of?

00:18.660 --> 00:21.160
Your fucking uncle
and that bitch wife of his.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.640
I know you know something
beyond that fucking club.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.540
What?

00:25.740 --> 00:27.130
Stable man says Louie rides
a couple times a week.

00:27.330 --> 00:28.470
And Kane wants her alive.

00:28.670 --> 00:30.300
Ain't nothing normal
about this goddamn business.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.820
These young niggas
ain't got no respect,

00:33.020 --> 00:34.340
no code, no honor.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.650
They ain't us.

00:36.850 --> 00:38.310
Everything all right?

00:38.510 --> 00:39.960
JEROME:
I'm out.

00:41.210 --> 00:42.490
Where you going?

00:42.690 --> 00:44.490
- JEROME: Out.
- What?

00:44.690 --> 00:47.010
Jerome, where are you going?!

00:47.210 --> 00:48.670
If I had to leave,
would you come with me?

00:48.870 --> 00:50.150
Are you using Russian spies
as an excuse

00:50.350 --> 00:52.390
<i>to get me to move</i>
<i>in with you, Teddy?</i>

00:52.590 --> 00:53.980
TEDDY:
Can you get surveillance
up on the residence

00:54.180 --> 00:55.330
without telling Langley
too much?

00:55.530 --> 00:57.710
<i>HAVEMEYER:</i>
<i>You want to get in there?</i>

00:57.910 --> 00:58.880
<i>TEDDY:</i>
<i>Let me figure it out.</i>

01:00.500 --> 01:02.160
<i>FRANKLIN:</i>
<i>Took a little trip today.</i>

01:02.360 --> 01:04.340
Figured I'd treat your old man
to some dinner.

01:04.540 --> 01:05.860
What do you think it's gonna do
to your future,

01:06.060 --> 01:07.340
<i>you kill a CIA officer's</i>
<i>father, huh?</i>

01:07.540 --> 01:08.510
FRANKLIN:
Wrong answer.

01:08.710 --> 01:09.690
- [gasping]
- [Cassandra screams]

01:09.890 --> 01:11.240
<i>TEDDY:</i>
<i>What did you just do?</i>

01:11.440 --> 01:13.040
<i>FRANKLIN:</i>
<i>Transfer my fucking money.</i>

01:13.240 --> 01:14.170
Or next I'm gonna go
after your woman.

01:14.370 --> 01:15.520
<i>Then your kid Paul.</i>

01:15.720 --> 01:17.180
<i>I'll bleed them.</i>

01:17.380 --> 01:19.040
<i>Just like I did your daddy.</i>

01:22.700 --> 01:25.840
<i>[phone ringing]</i>

01:27.840 --> 01:29.530
[clears throat]

01:29.730 --> 01:31.880
[ringing continues]

01:37.540 --> 01:39.370
Yeah?

01:39.570 --> 01:40.610
Hello?

01:40.810 --> 01:42.160
<i>TEDDY:</i>
<i>Julia, it's Teddy.</i>

01:44.200 --> 01:46.030
What?

01:47.380 --> 01:49.900
<i>What is it?</i>

01:50.100 --> 01:54.280
There has been a viable threat
against your life

01:54.480 --> 01:56.110
and you need
to relocate immediately.

01:56.310 --> 01:58.080
What? What kind of threat?

01:58.280 --> 01:59.390
<i>TEDDY:</i>
<i>I'll tell you everything</i>
<i>once you're settled.</i>

01:59.590 --> 02:01.260
<i>But right now</i>
<i>you need to get moving.</i>

02:01.460 --> 02:02.910
<i>There's a police escort and</i>
<i>a few officers on their way--</i>

02:03.110 --> 02:06.400
Teddy, stop.
Tell me what happened.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.610
My father...

02:08.810 --> 02:10.440
was murdered.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.440
<i> </i><i>And the person responsible said</i><i> </i>
<i>that you and Paul were next.</i>

02:13.640 --> 02:15.820
<i>So you have to pack whatever </i><i> </i>
<i>you need and get moving, okay?</i>

02:16.020 --> 02:18.100
We'll talk more
once you're secure.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.450
Oh, fuck.

02:24.650 --> 02:26.070
Yeah, fine.

02:26.270 --> 02:27.240
Okay.

02:29.180 --> 02:34.250
Number was traced
to a farmhouse in Tangonoxie,

02:34.450 --> 02:36.430
about 30 miles
outside of the city.

02:36.630 --> 02:38.600
It's been burned to the ground.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.570
They're starting
to search the site now.

02:44.020 --> 02:46.510
I don't want any other law
enforcement agencies involved.

02:46.710 --> 02:47.650
We handle this ourselves,

02:47.850 --> 02:49.440
we just got to put
eyes on Franklin,

02:49.640 --> 02:52.410
on his penthouse,
his mother's house, his office.

02:53.610 --> 02:55.280
He's not gonna be dumb enough
to show his face again,

02:55.480 --> 02:57.760
but we got to be ready
if he does.

02:59.970 --> 03:02.280
Look, I know you
and your father weren't close.

03:04.280 --> 03:08.180
But I can tell you
from experience,

03:08.380 --> 03:10.950
losing a parent you had
a complicated relationship with

03:11.150 --> 03:12.640
can be just as difficult--

03:12.840 --> 03:14.120
It wasn't "complicated,"
it was nonexistent.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.810
But this is very important.

03:16.010 --> 03:19.130
So, no, I'm not walking away.
Not for a day, not for an hour.

03:19.330 --> 03:20.990
Okay. Okay.

03:21.190 --> 03:24.370
I can't make you
do anything, okay?

03:24.570 --> 03:26.820
We have problems, can't afford
mistakes. I get it.

03:27.020 --> 03:27.960
You say you're good, fine.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.340
But you better make damn sure.

03:30.540 --> 03:33.210
Because it's not just your ass
on the line here.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.800
Yeah.

03:43.980 --> 03:45.980
â™ª

03:56.680 --> 03:58.170
I'm gonna settle up,

03:58.370 --> 04:00.030
check on my mom's.

04:00.230 --> 04:02.030
Back in a minute.

04:06.170 --> 04:07.310
What are you doing?

04:08.520 --> 04:10.700
Thank you.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.840
I'm not getting back
on that plane.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.220
And neither are you.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.530
VERONIQUE:
Let's just get back to L.A.

04:15.730 --> 04:17.530
and we can figure out
what happens next, okay?

04:17.730 --> 04:18.880
What happens next?

04:19.080 --> 04:21.710
Full-scale
government scorched earth.

04:21.910 --> 04:24.570
This is over, my love.

04:24.770 --> 04:26.260
Time for self-preservation.

04:27.260 --> 04:29.230
Did you see what I just saw?

04:29.430 --> 04:32.100
Your man is coming undone.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.610
And the only way
you have a future

04:33.810 --> 04:36.860
is if you walk away
from him right now.

04:37.060 --> 04:38.720
We'll play it smart.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.730
You say you're scared,

04:40.930 --> 04:42.550
you want to get his baby
out of harm's way,

04:42.750 --> 04:45.730
you will be waiting
when he gets the money.

04:46.730 --> 04:48.390
And then we vanish,

04:48.590 --> 04:51.150
like we have
a hundred times before.

04:51.350 --> 04:53.570
I have passports
for the both of us.

04:53.770 --> 04:56.050
We will raise this baby,
you and me.

04:57.220 --> 04:59.430
It's how it has to be.

04:59.630 --> 05:01.950
Since when?

05:02.150 --> 05:04.160
Since when do you have
passports for us?

05:04.360 --> 05:08.130
Since the moment you told me
what you were involved in here.

05:08.330 --> 05:09.930
Did you think for a second

05:10.130 --> 05:12.440
that I'd agree to any of this
without an exit plan?

05:13.750 --> 05:16.110
This is what you wanted
from the start.

05:16.310 --> 05:18.420
Why you came here,
why you agreed to all--

05:18.620 --> 05:21.840
You called me, and I came.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.110
Because you are my daughter
and I love you.

05:25.310 --> 05:26.460
Unlike that man in there,

05:26.660 --> 05:28.950
who will sell you out
in a second if...

05:29.150 --> 05:30.120
FRANKLIN:
What's this?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.300
CASSANDRA:
Oh, well, we've been talking

05:35.500 --> 05:37.300
and in light of
what's just transpired,

05:37.500 --> 05:39.960
we think it might be best
if, uh, Veronique and I

05:40.160 --> 05:41.680
didn't go back to L.A.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.000
Oh, yeah?

05:44.200 --> 05:45.790
CASSANDRA:
We all want what's best
for her,

05:45.990 --> 05:48.140
for your baby.

05:48.340 --> 05:50.930
So, we'll take a car
to Phoenix, fly from there,

05:51.130 --> 05:52.490
make sure she's safe...

05:52.690 --> 05:56.460
then you can come meet us
when you've sorted this all out.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.140
Is that what you want, V?

05:59.800 --> 06:01.940
No.

06:02.140 --> 06:03.980
No, it isn't.

06:04.180 --> 06:06.360
I won't go back to that life.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.880
Rootless and always running.

06:08.080 --> 06:10.160
And I won't condemn
my child to it, Mother.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.470
But you'll condemn your child
to death or prison?

06:13.670 --> 06:14.820
Life with a monster?

06:15.020 --> 06:17.480
He's not a monster.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.650
Not to me.

06:19.850 --> 06:22.650
To me, he's a man
who hasn't lied,

06:22.850 --> 06:24.860
or raised a hand,

06:25.060 --> 06:28.420
or left me alone
in a prison cell.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.140
He's the first person
to ever put me first.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.870
He's doing everything
in his power

06:34.070 --> 06:36.880
to deliver the life I want,

06:37.080 --> 06:39.500
no matter how he has to do it.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.670
And until that changes, Mother,

06:42.870 --> 06:44.470
I'm staying.

06:48.060 --> 06:49.680
Okay?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.730
Come on, babe.

07:04.930 --> 07:07.910
[jet engine whirring]

07:08.110 --> 07:10.180
Sir.

07:10.380 --> 07:12.360
<i>[jet engine whirring]</i>

07:18.910 --> 07:21.960
But you know Tony doesn't give
a fuck about the KGB.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.580
He's threatening
to shut it all down

07:23.780 --> 07:25.230
and send me to prison.

07:25.430 --> 07:27.270
And what about Franklin?

07:27.470 --> 07:30.070
He's in Kansas City.

07:30.270 --> 07:32.410
Kansas City?
What is he doing there?

07:32.610 --> 07:34.550
Killing Teddy's father.

07:34.750 --> 07:37.280
[shaky breaths]

07:37.480 --> 07:39.800
You still think
it's a good idea

07:40.000 --> 07:42.630
to make the deal with him?

07:42.830 --> 07:44.560
[sighs]

07:44.760 --> 07:47.080
<i>Pos a ver que pedo.</i>

07:47.280 --> 07:48.150
Searching blind ain't smart.

07:48.350 --> 07:49.910
Yeah, well, I can't sit around

07:50.110 --> 07:51.330
doing nothing no more.

07:51.530 --> 07:53.090
And y'all two, y'all been
waiting for weeks.

07:53.290 --> 07:54.640
Where the fuck was he going?

07:54.840 --> 07:56.300
He mostly been holed up here.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.750
Or out doing business.

07:57.950 --> 08:01.060

Jerome fucking Saint!

08:12.420 --> 08:14.320
Whoops.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.140
Guess you got to put that
on our tab.

08:17.660 --> 08:20.290
[scoffs] You know what?
I'm not doing this with you.

08:20.490 --> 08:21.950
You can't even barely stand up.

08:22.150 --> 08:23.640
We'll talk tomorrow.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.470
Uh, talk tomorrow ain't gonna
work for me.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.610
I'll be gone, going to Jamaica.

08:28.810 --> 08:29.990
- Getting on a plane.
- What?

08:30.190 --> 08:32.960
Yeah. I'm gonna pack
my goddamn bags,

08:33.160 --> 08:34.860
go to the airport,

08:35.060 --> 08:37.130
get a ticket
for goddamn Kingston.

08:37.330 --> 08:39.830
Sit back, real easy. Free.

08:40.030 --> 08:43.860
[laughing]:
Okay, Jerome. Fine.

08:44.060 --> 08:46.040
- Think I'm bullshitting?
- No, I think you're looking
for a fight.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.630
And I ain't biting.

08:48.830 --> 08:49.660
I ain't looking
for no goddamn fight.

08:49.860 --> 08:50.630
I'm telling you
I'm goddamn done.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.290
Done selling crack.

08:53.490 --> 08:55.500
I'm done getting shot at.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.290
I'm done trying
to kill my goddamn family.

08:57.490 --> 08:59.160
Okay! Fine!

08:59.360 --> 09:01.400
What the fuck
am I supposed to do with that?!

09:01.600 --> 09:02.710
Maybe you're supposed
to acknowledge this shit

09:02.910 --> 09:04.540
is fucking insanity.

09:04.740 --> 09:06.540
The money ain't worth
this shit, Lou.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.990
No matter how fucking wrong
this shit is,

09:09.190 --> 09:11.030
ain't nothing gonna
make it right.

09:11.230 --> 09:12.680
Or maybe...

09:13.720 --> 09:15.790
...maybe you stop this shit
'cause you love me.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.790
Hmm?

09:18.830 --> 09:21.870
I know I stayed in this shit
for you, right?

09:22.070 --> 09:24.040
Because if I left,
your ass would be dead.

09:26.390 --> 09:28.490
I know it ain't your fault.

09:30.050 --> 09:32.050
You're just fucked up.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.500
Yeah.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.050
You don't got no way
to be happy.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.090
And it's my goddamn fault
for trying to fix you.

09:38.290 --> 09:40.200
But I'm goddamn done.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.160
I...
It ain't my problem no more.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.030
I'm free of this shit.

09:44.230 --> 09:46.060
You don't mean this.

09:46.260 --> 09:49.340
It's the realest thing
I ever fucking said to you.

10:04.740 --> 10:06.530
[engine shuts off]

10:17.710 --> 10:19.370
You made the right choice.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.100
Come on.

10:30.550 --> 10:31.900
Teddy will retaliate.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.150
So we got to stay out of sight
until this is over.

10:34.350 --> 10:35.910
The house, the shelter...

10:36.110 --> 10:38.730
can't go to either one.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.090
He can come at you, too, Lee.

10:43.290 --> 10:45.430
If Teddy want to come at us
in the projects,

10:45.630 --> 10:48.160
I say good luck
to that cracker motherfucker.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.610
So this was all part
of your original plan?

10:50.810 --> 10:53.300
Waiting around wasn't working.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.920
Now he wants us
just as bad as we want him.

10:56.930 --> 10:58.650
And he'll be rattled,

10:58.850 --> 11:00.930
vulnerable.

11:01.130 --> 11:04.760
I just need to draw
that motherfucker out.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.280
[sighs]

11:07.760 --> 11:10.980
Listen, um, I'm exhausted.

11:11.180 --> 11:15.020
Okay? So, uh, Mama...

11:15.220 --> 11:18.020
why don't you follow me and V
back to the stash house? Huh?

I'll be right here.

11:19.670 --> 11:22.640
Leon's right, Teddy ain't
coming to the projects.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.300
And I'm not laying
on some cot in a flophouse,

11:25.500 --> 11:27.510
or hiding in a hotel room
under a fake name.

11:27.710 --> 11:29.510
Mama, you're not listening--

11:29.710 --> 11:32.440
Hey, look, we'll-we'll keep her
safe. It-It's all good.

11:36.450 --> 11:37.970
All right.

11:40.490 --> 11:42.700
Let me know
if you need anything.

Ben, are you in there?

12:18.970 --> 12:20.740
If you don't want your neighbors
to hear this,

12:20.940 --> 12:22.530
you should open the door.

12:46.210 --> 12:47.520
Could come in.

12:49.690 --> 12:51.350
I was just heading home.

12:51.550 --> 12:53.080
That's not really true.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.350
I-I was heading
to my girlfriend's house.

12:56.390 --> 12:58.220
And it occurred to me that...

12:58.420 --> 13:00.220
this might be
the last opportunity

13:00.420 --> 13:02.360
we have to speak
before it's too late.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.610

There's so many questions
I wanted to ask.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.760
The things you must have done
to end up in this place.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.870
All the lives you must've lived.

13:36.150 --> 13:38.920
You're wondering
what the play is here.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.090
There isn't one.

13:41.290 --> 13:43.440
I know how this
is supposed to go.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.270
I know how
this is supposed to end,

13:45.470 --> 13:49.790
but I thought maybe
we could sit down, and talk.

13:52.310 --> 13:54.790
See if there
wasn't another way.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.280
Before you try
to explode my world

13:59.480 --> 14:01.150
and I kill you for it.

TEDDY:
Go to your people, you tell them
you got it wrong.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.610
I'm not doing
what you think I am.

14:20.810 --> 14:22.300
[chuckles]

14:23.650 --> 14:25.970
And if I did?

14:26.170 --> 14:27.620
You think I'm allowed
to determine

14:27.820 --> 14:28.970
what I can and cannot pursue?

14:29.170 --> 14:31.140
I just think a dead end's
a dead end.

14:32.620 --> 14:33.940
They're not here.

14:35.630 --> 14:37.110
You are.

14:38.150 --> 14:40.150
[scoffs]

14:40.350 --> 14:41.880
What if I believe what
you're doing is a crime

14:42.080 --> 14:43.570
that should be exposed?

14:43.770 --> 14:45.020
Then I'd say there's people
in this world

14:45.220 --> 14:47.880
who think the way that you
live your life is a crime.

14:48.080 --> 14:52.020
But maybe that's none
of their fucking business.

14:53.330 --> 14:55.650
There's just so few people
on this planet

14:55.850 --> 14:58.170
who understand what it is we do.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.970
What it costs.

15:06.170 --> 15:08.830
And how hard it is
to keep going.

15:11.210 --> 15:14.320
When you know that, inevitably,
you're gonna end up all alone.

15:16.530 --> 15:21.710
Your whole life sacrificed
at the altar of secrecy.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.020
And then you wonder
if it was worth it.

15:27.400 --> 15:30.370
Or, worse, you wonder why you
did it all in the first place.

15:30.570 --> 15:32.890
What am I actually trying
to live up to?

15:33.090 --> 15:35.720
And I know
how crazy this sounds,

15:35.920 --> 15:37.210
but ever since
I learned you were here,

15:37.410 --> 15:40.550
I actually felt less alone.

16:06.750 --> 16:08.790
Holy shit.

16:22.660 --> 16:24.640
I can destroy you just as easily

16:24.840 --> 16:26.740
as I could've killed you
tonight.

16:28.430 --> 16:30.780
And you know that.

16:35.610 --> 16:38.030
Walk away.
Take the gift I'm giving you.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.170
Take whoever's size ten shoes
those are in your closet

16:40.370 --> 16:42.930

you want to live.

16:44.310 --> 16:46.000
If you're still in
this apartment tomorrow night,

16:46.200 --> 16:48.000
I'll assume you still want
my help.

Been better.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.500
I know you said you're done.

17:39.050 --> 17:42.510
But I got some things to say,
if you want to hear.

17:42.710 --> 17:44.880
Sure.

17:57.170 --> 18:00.900
I'm sorry...

18:01.100 --> 18:03.800
that our life has become this.

18:04.870 --> 18:08.220
I knew that Franklin
wouldn't be happy

18:08.420 --> 18:11.220
if I went over his head.

18:14.430 --> 18:17.200
But I could never have known
that Teddy would do that.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.890
And that that would
bring us here.

18:21.090 --> 18:24.230
With you and Franklin on
opposite sides of the gun, I...

18:25.790 --> 18:27.380
I been asking myself, why?

18:27.580 --> 18:31.240
Why I couldn't just be happy
with where we were.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.900
Because we had money, right?

18:35.100 --> 18:39.080
Power. Respect. [sighs]

18:42.770 --> 18:43.950
But no.

18:44.150 --> 18:45.740
You did.

18:45.940 --> 18:48.610
'Cause I've been running
this thing, right?

18:48.810 --> 18:51.780
And you see that.
But our customers,

all they see is you.

18:54.020 --> 18:56.300
Every deal we make,
they talking to you.

18:56.500 --> 18:57.930
They look at me
long enough to wink,

18:58.130 --> 19:00.140
or lick they lips...

19:00.340 --> 19:02.410
They ain't dealing with me.

Is that enough to die over,
though?

19:05.340 --> 19:08.250

19:08.450 --> 19:10.140
Yeah.

I think maybe it is.

for you.

Everything.

19:18.530 --> 19:20.470
I know you have, Jerome.

19:20.670 --> 19:23.260
So when you're saying that
you can't do that here,

19:23.460 --> 19:24.780
that you done...

19:26.260 --> 19:28.440
I hear you.

19:30.300 --> 19:33.100
But I just need more time.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.790
Because I made promises.

19:35.990 --> 19:37.310
You mean like Teddy?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.310
I'm not scared of Teddy.

Maybe I am.

out of Panama.

I don't know.

to leave, but...

...after this, I don't think
you can stay here.

So I can help you find a place,

if you'd rather not be with me.

20:51.720 --> 20:53.520
For how long?

20:53.720 --> 20:55.180
Till Franklin's dead.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.700
So that's what happens now?

20:57.900 --> 21:00.010
You kill Franklin?

21:00.210 --> 21:02.570
And then what?

I'm not good with having my fate
in someone else's hands.

to continue this...

how to use it? That's fine.

till after I have him.

No.

23:03.680 --> 23:07.210
It can't wait. Need it now.

23:08.660 --> 23:12.350
In that case,
I can give you a million.

23:12.550 --> 23:15.560

did to me, okay?

Okay.

How soon can you move?

As soon as I get
the documents and the money.

You know it's not going
to be easy to find Teddy

23:46.620 --> 23:47.600

- One more thing.

I'm gonna need your word

what you need from Teddy
you're gonna kill him.

Teddy cannot be alive to come
after us once I betray him.

gonna make to you today, Oso.
