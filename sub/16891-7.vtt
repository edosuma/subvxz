WEBVTT

00:01.484 --> 00:03.020
Previously on "Rescue Me"...

00:03.088 --> 00:05.014
You want to memorialize somebody?

00:05.134 --> 00:07.890
You do it by talking
about their deeds.

00:07.959 --> 00:10.933
Have to remember the firefighters on
the morning of 9/11,

00:11.053 --> 00:13.077
they memorialized themselves

00:13.567 --> 00:16.532
by writing notes to their loved
ones and leaving in the lockers.

00:16.601 --> 00:19.468
I wrote some letters.
I kind of took what

00:19.537 --> 00:20.972
Feinberg was saying
the other day to heart.

00:21.092 --> 00:22.437
You want me to give these,
like, a proofread?

00:22.506 --> 00:23.511
Do not read them.

00:23.631 --> 00:25.636
I won't. I will not read them.

00:29.576 --> 00:32.055
I had a white or a blue shirt on
with stripes on my arm,

00:32.174 --> 00:34.933
I bet you I could do a better job at keeping
some loose cannon prick in line!

00:35.053 --> 00:36.520
Oh, you know what, I would love
to give you

00:36.589 --> 00:38.623
the keys to the kingdom for a couple days.
Chief?

00:38.691 --> 00:40.258
- 5 days.
- Oh ho ho!

00:40.508 --> 00:42.760
Quiet. You're acting
lieutenant for 5 days, however

00:42.880 --> 00:45.537
all decisions must run through me.
You understand?

00:45.606 --> 00:46.905
Cool.

00:46.974 --> 00:48.105
What the hell are you doing?

00:48.225 --> 00:49.942
That's mine!

00:50.062 --> 00:53.446
What is wrong with you?

00:53.515 --> 00:55.964
Oh, my God.

00:57.685 --> 00:59.528
What are you doing here?

00:59.648 --> 01:03.021
I never let you read that letter
because it is the truly only

01:03.090 --> 01:06.455
secret thing that Jimmy and I
will ever have ever again.

01:07.626 --> 01:09.983
Get out.

01:12.493 --> 01:14.768
Ok.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:41.932 --> 01:43.846
Jesus Christ.

01:44.345 --> 01:45.731
Can you believe this? Huh?

01:46.380 --> 01:48.514
I thought I was having a senior
moment this morning when I came

01:48.583 --> 01:52.018
in here. I thought I was walking
into the wrong goddamn house.

01:52.087 --> 01:53.152
How do you know you didn't?

01:53.221 --> 01:56.170
Well, that's Mike over there
cleaning the halligans.

01:56.290 --> 02:00.547
Look at Garrity. Franco's having him
cleaning that door for the third time,

02:00.667 --> 02:02.133
his reward for coming in early.

02:02.253 --> 02:03.340
Look at the floor.

02:03.460 --> 02:07.931
Huh? You could eat right off of it.
Not that I'm encouraging you to eat.

02:08.252 --> 02:12.440
You know, now that
morale is at an all-time low,

02:12.509 --> 02:15.644
between Garrity and Franco,
this place is spic and span.

02:15.712 --> 02:18.147
Yeah, I guess that would
make Garrity span.

02:18.215 --> 02:19.248
Ha!

02:19.317 --> 02:21.383
Hey, guys. Where are we?

02:21.452 --> 02:23.549
Yeah, it's either the
twilight zone or hell.

02:23.669 --> 02:27.523
Firefighter Gavin, firefighter
Shea, you are both late.

02:27.592 --> 02:29.659
Hell.

02:29.728 --> 02:31.728
Sorry, big man.
No smoking in the house.

02:31.796 --> 02:32.562
It's not even lit.

02:32.630 --> 02:34.197
Yeah, well, all the same,
it's against the protocols

02:34.265 --> 02:36.632
of your new fitness regimen,
cupcake, details

02:36.701 --> 02:41.003
of which are posted in your locker. I expect
a signed copy on my desk within the hour.

02:41.072 --> 02:42.071
Oh, your desk.

02:42.140 --> 02:43.939
This is the way Needles
explained this whole thing to me--

02:44.008 --> 02:48.778
He's on day 2 of a 5-day
term as the interim lieutenant.

02:48.847 --> 02:50.362
It's only the tip of the iceberg, you know.

02:50.482 --> 02:53.951
I don't think this guy's eaten, slept, or
even pissed in 72 hours.

02:54.020 --> 02:55.787
Well, chief, I think it's just
a testament to what a man

02:55.855 --> 02:57.376
can do when he puts his mind to something.

02:57.496 --> 03:00.458
Speaking of which, why don't you follow
suit and get dressed. We got work to do.

03:02.562 --> 03:04.262
That means you, too, Fonzie.

03:04.331 --> 03:05.129
Hey!

03:05.198 --> 03:08.099
Heyyyy... no more kicking around
the house, drinking coffee in your

03:08.168 --> 03:11.269
motorcycle boots and your leather
jacket, slick. Station gear at all times.

03:11.337 --> 03:13.004
Frankie--I'm sorry.

03:13.072 --> 03:15.606
Lieutenant, I think I'm gonna
rub the paint off the door

03:15.675 --> 03:16.918
if I do any more.
Can I do something else?

03:17.038 --> 03:18.433
Well, did you hit those
couple spots I pointed out?

03:18.553 --> 03:19.543
Yeah, I got 'em.

03:19.611 --> 03:23.179
All right, then carry on, firefighter
Garrity, but tuck your shirt in first.

03:23.248 --> 03:25.214
- You serious?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

03:25.283 --> 03:26.983
You look like you're about to
squeeze a diamond out of your

03:27.052 --> 03:29.052
ass is what you look like.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.987
Garrity, I think just for that,
you ought to hit that door

03:31.056 --> 03:32.769
one more time, asshole.

03:36.027 --> 03:37.570
We've really--we gotta
put up with this?

03:37.690 --> 03:40.931
Don't look at me now.
This is Lou's brilliant idea.

03:40.999 --> 03:42.799
Now I know how Mary Shelley felt.

03:42.868 --> 03:44.634
Mm-hmm. Francostein.

03:44.703 --> 03:46.269
Mmm, very funny.

03:46.338 --> 03:48.438
I guess now the only question is
is Lou gonna stand by his word,

03:48.507 --> 03:51.140
or are you gonna bitch
out and pull rank?

03:51.209 --> 03:52.275
How many calls you had?

03:52.344 --> 03:53.676
Been a few.

03:53.745 --> 03:58.047
A few false alarms, a couple of medicals.
Rivera's been riding along.

03:58.116 --> 03:59.581
Riding along.

03:59.650 --> 04:00.482
Hee hee hee.

04:01.852 --> 04:03.285
Something funny?

04:03.354 --> 04:06.255
Yeah, good old ride-along Rivera.

04:06.323 --> 04:08.399
No, no, this is all good, but
you know what,

04:08.519 --> 04:12.262
we'll see what you're made of when we hit
the streets, get into the shed.

04:12.330 --> 04:13.196
Yeah.

04:13.265 --> 04:14.465
Ride along.

04:14.534 --> 04:16.586
And you owe me 35
cents for that cigar.

04:19.873 --> 04:20.973
You better get used to it.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.660
You're a boss now.

04:24.011 --> 04:26.645
Yeah, all right.

04:26.714 --> 04:28.012
Hey.

04:29.350 --> 04:31.017
Oh, no, Tom. What is this?

04:31.085 --> 04:32.732
Another love letter?
I don't want it.

04:32.852 --> 04:37.413
Listen. I apologize for baiting you

04:38.239 --> 04:41.677
before with the first letter and the food
and everything, but

04:43.545 --> 04:46.492
listen, you were right, ok,
what you said that day.

04:46.612 --> 04:47.748
I went down to ground zero.

04:47.868 --> 04:52.774
I thought about driving my
truck into the hole, but...

04:54.076 --> 04:56.076
Then I thought about what you
said, and you know what,

04:56.196 --> 05:00.013
I don't want to be number 344, you know?

05:00.082 --> 05:01.982
I'm over that shit, all of it.

05:02.050 --> 05:03.483
The survivor's guilt.

05:03.552 --> 05:08.943
You know, I'm living now in the here and now.
I got a whole new set of priorities.

05:09.768 --> 05:14.299
So you know, this letter--I poured,

05:14.666 --> 05:18.156
you know...
I poured a lot of my...

05:18.539 --> 05:23.950
You know, my innermost... stuff.

05:24.808 --> 05:29.121
That stuff are called feelings.

05:29.565 --> 05:32.189
And you know what, Tom, I'm sorry that
I betrayed your trust

05:32.309 --> 05:33.811
and that I opened the first letter.

05:34.178 --> 05:36.268
It's not very often one
gets a glimpse inside

05:36.388 --> 05:39.707
the secret inner sensitive
life of Tommy Gavin.

05:40.319 --> 05:41.993
Well, this is it.

05:42.061 --> 05:43.431
This is it. This is the real one.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.696
Yeah, and you know the deal.

05:44.765 --> 05:46.951
- I know the deal.
- Ok.

05:47.257 --> 05:49.700
All right? Done. Away.

05:49.769 --> 05:51.165
My word of honor.

05:52.171 --> 05:54.638
We both know your
word is worth shit.

05:54.707 --> 05:57.229
Well, kind of like your feelings,
so I figure we're both equal.

05:57.349 --> 05:59.715
- So there. We're square.
- We're square.

05:59.835 --> 06:02.512
All right. Let me grab a coffee.

06:03.148 --> 06:06.649
You gonna go get changed,
like ride-along Rivera said?

06:06.718 --> 06:08.184
No. I never listen to you.

06:08.253 --> 06:10.319
Why would I listen to that asshole?
You want a coffee?

06:10.388 --> 06:11.387
No, I'm good.

06:11.456 --> 06:12.455
All right.

06:12.524 --> 06:14.019
- See you later.
- Yeah.

06:24.169 --> 06:25.902
- I'm not opening the letter!
- Oh, geez!

Finalizing the seating chart?

ground zero again.
And when we tell you what the deal is

08:16.847 --> 08:19.062
with the wedding, you
will not freak out.

08:19.182 --> 08:25.319
- Why am I gonna freak--
- Ah, ah! We discussed this. Yap, no. Zip.

08:25.387 --> 08:29.086
This is my day, ok?
The most important day in my life so far,

08:29.206 --> 08:33.493
so please no yelling, no drinking, ok?
And no jokes about Sean's family.

08:33.562 --> 08:36.330
Why would I make a joke about Sean's--
Dad! No finger-pointing,

08:36.399 --> 08:40.168
no fist-punching, and I forgot.

08:40.236 --> 08:43.471
Uncle Teddy's walking
me down the aisle now.

08:43.539 --> 08:44.869
What?

08:44.989 --> 08:47.409
- Now, don't blow a gasket.
- I'm not blowing a gasket!

08:47.478 --> 08:49.845
- I'm asking--
- Looks like you're already blowing one!

08:49.914 --> 08:53.283
Hey, hey, hey! See, this is why
I'm doing it instead of you.

08:53.351 --> 08:56.519
She'll be walking down the
aisle in her $10,000 dress.

08:56.588 --> 08:59.322
But--but--but--but--but ah ah.
I thought it was 8 grand,

08:59.391 --> 09:01.524
not--what's 10 grand? What's--
The one I fell in love with

09:01.592 --> 09:03.025
was a little bit more expensive.

09:03.093 --> 09:04.894
Let me get this straight.
10 grand now for the dress?

09:04.962 --> 09:06.929
Is this the final price?
There's no more. This is it, right?

09:06.997 --> 09:10.065
10 grand. 10 grand, and I can't drink.
Why don't you just

09:10.134 --> 09:11.700
shoot me in the head while
we're at it, ok?

09:11.769 --> 09:12.968
See? He wants to drink!

09:13.037 --> 09:14.803
You're not in control
of your sobriety.

09:14.872 --> 09:16.592
You know what I really want to do
is punch you in the face right now.

09:16.712 --> 09:18.392
Oh, save that for the
wedding--big, big finish.

09:18.512 --> 09:20.018
- Oh, that's funny.
- Come on, girls. Get the baby.

09:20.138 --> 09:24.179
Let's go. Janet, I really think we ought
to think about going with plan "B".

09:24.247 --> 09:25.013
What's plan "B"?

09:25.081 --> 09:27.749
Come on. Oh, you'll find out.
Come on, girls.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.417
Do you guys have enough diapers?

09:29.485 --> 09:33.120
You'll be the one needing the
diapers with all the shit in here!

09:33.188 --> 09:34.854
He's so funny.

09:34.923 --> 09:37.924
What's he talking about--plan "B"?

09:37.992 --> 09:41.160
Plan "B" is you don't
go to the wedding.

09:42.301 --> 09:45.364
You gotta be kidding me, right?
That I don't go to the wedding at all?

09:45.433 --> 09:47.166
Tommy, it is a celebration.

09:47.234 --> 09:49.034
There will be alcohol everywhere.

09:49.103 --> 09:52.437
Ok, honey, I have not had a
drink in I don't know how long.

09:52.506 --> 09:54.774
When is the last time you
went to a meeting, huh?

09:54.843 --> 09:57.080
- I don't know. I've been so busy--
- Name the meeting. Name the date.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.902
I don't know. It's like 5 weeks
ago or something like that.

09:59.022 --> 10:00.509
No. 3 1/2.

10:00.629 --> 10:02.501
- Ok, 3 1/2. Even better.
- Months.

10:02.621 --> 10:05.644
Oh. Really?

10:05.764 --> 10:08.338
Look, Tommy, the thing that
you did with Sheila--

10:08.458 --> 10:11.552
Ok, even though you didn't drink
a drop, it is a sign.

10:11.858 --> 10:15.757
You are not ready for this. You are not in
a sane state of mind.

10:16.632 --> 10:18.999
So Uncle Teddy is walking her
down that aisle because

10:19.068 --> 10:22.256
the odds are, even with all the alcohol
flowing freely,

10:22.376 --> 10:24.538
we can count on him
to walk a straight line.

10:25.742 --> 10:26.741
Now, did you talk to Mickey?

10:26.810 --> 10:29.059
- No, I haven't--
- Of course not,

10:29.179 --> 10:30.460
because how could you talk to him

10:30.580 --> 10:32.480
when your head is so far up
your own goddamn ass?

10:32.549 --> 10:35.517
Honey, my head is not my ass, ok?

10:35.586 --> 10:37.653
Ok, I want Mickey performing
that ceremony,

10:37.773 --> 10:40.756
and I want you off that rig
and into a safe job.

10:40.876 --> 10:42.739
Yes, somewhere out of harm's way.

10:42.859 --> 10:45.547
Honey...
no, Tommy, this is not a negotiation.

10:45.667 --> 10:49.597
Ok, you want to be a real father to this baby
and not some sperm donor named dad,

10:49.666 --> 10:52.934
then you will get off that
rig and into somewhere safe.

10:53.003 --> 10:57.739
We've talked about this before.
We've tried it before, 9 million discussions.

10:57.808 --> 11:01.976
I--I don't have time to
go to these meetings now.

11:02.045 --> 11:05.414
Get to a goddamn meeting every
goddamn day

11:05.781 --> 11:10.644
and bring me proof! Ok, and do not--and I
repeat--do not

11:10.764 --> 11:12.254
show up at that rehearsal dinner drunk.

11:12.323 --> 11:16.191
I'm not...gonna.

11:16.260 --> 11:21.023
I'll be there. I'll be there,
and I will be sober as a judge.

11:21.451 --> 11:24.167
Ok, good, because that will go
a long way to showing Colleen

11:24.236 --> 11:28.172
that maybe you are capable of
walking her down that aisle.

11:28.241 --> 11:32.279
I'm... capable.

11:32.712 --> 11:34.578
I will be there.

11:34.647 --> 11:35.813
Sober.

11:35.882 --> 11:36.747
As a judge.

11:36.816 --> 11:38.845
Done deal.

11:42.321 --> 11:43.487
You got it.

11:49.927 --> 11:55.131
So, serenity, patience.

11:55.199 --> 11:57.133
Easy does it.

11:57.202 --> 11:59.002
Keeping calm.

11:59.071 --> 12:01.405
I wasn't always the laid-back,
easy-going guy you see before

12:01.474 --> 12:05.375
you here today. There was a time
when the easy-going,

12:05.444 --> 12:07.744
steady guy you see before you
here--

12:07.813 --> 12:10.214
Put whiskey in his orange
juice every morning.

12:10.282 --> 12:13.551
There was a time--
Yeah, Tom.

12:13.619 --> 12:15.599
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt,
but

12:15.719 --> 12:19.824
a little bit of a rush. I'm late for work
and got all the wedding

12:19.893 --> 12:21.993
crap going on, as you know.
And I really gotta get my ass

12:22.062 --> 12:23.061
to the firehouse, blah, blah, blah.

12:23.129 --> 12:28.333
Can I talk to you--sorry--just
one second privately?

12:28.401 --> 12:32.537
Tom, I'm not going to the wedding.

12:32.606 --> 12:35.244
I really need to kind of
go to the wedding, Mick.

12:36.543 --> 12:39.076
I'm sorry, everybody.
This is my cousin Tommy.

12:39.145 --> 12:40.945
- Hey, Tommy.
- Hi, Tommy.

12:41.014 --> 12:41.813
Hey, everybody. Hey.

12:41.882 --> 12:44.983
He's also a raging--uh, sorry.
He's also in recovery.

12:45.051 --> 12:50.255
Yeah, well, I mean, I wasn't
as bad as him, but whatever.

12:50.324 --> 12:52.123
Oh, is that right?

12:52.192 --> 12:55.768
Well, I wasn't.
I mean, I didn't

12:56.597 --> 12:59.365
put whiskey in my orange juice.
Listen,

12:59.641 --> 13:02.134
just tell me that you're gonna come to the
wedding, and this is all set.

13:02.254 --> 13:03.669
I just really need you
to come to the wedding.

13:03.738 --> 13:04.370
Go to hell.

13:04.439 --> 13:05.138
Hey! Hey!

13:05.206 --> 13:05.938
Go to hell!

13:06.007 --> 13:06.906
Go to hell! Get out!

13:06.975 --> 13:09.208
And you can take that goddamn
wedding and stick it

13:09.277 --> 13:11.541
where the sun don't shine.
She don't apologize to me.

13:11.661 --> 13:14.247
She and I never set foot in the same room
again as long as I live

13:14.316 --> 13:16.026
on this planet!
And you can tell her another thing.

13:16.146 --> 13:21.188
I don't care how hot her ass is, I am never,
ever sleeping with her again!

13:21.257 --> 13:24.425
All right, all right, I get it.
I get it. If you

13:24.494 --> 13:27.996
could just sign this.
It's a little note telling Janet

13:28.064 --> 13:30.365
that I definitely came to the meeting and
I was here for the whole--

13:30.433 --> 13:31.866
- All right, all right.
- Get out!

13:31.935 --> 13:33.301
- I'm going!
- Go!

13:33.370 --> 13:39.307
- Sorry, everybody. Didn't mean to...
- Let me go.

14:09.305 --> 14:13.934
"Dear Lou, you have been more of a brother
to me than even my own blood brother.

14:14.485 --> 14:16.614
The bond between us
goes deeper than the bond

14:16.734 --> 14:20.043
we felt as members of the
firefighting brotherhood.

14:21.051 --> 14:24.752
I trusted you with my life, and
now, upon my passing,

14:24.821 --> 14:29.458
I trust you with the lives of my wife
and my children, for you

14:29.526 --> 14:33.996
are a man much stronger than I ever
was, a man so brave that

14:34.065 --> 14:37.467
I felt safe no matter what the
circumstance might be each time

14:37.535 --> 14:39.509
you led us off that rig.

14:40.106 --> 14:41.866
All the praise and all the glory I was

14:41.986 --> 14:45.576
given for my so-called heroics
only existed because I knew

14:45.645 --> 14:50.264
no matter what that you were just a
few steps away ready,

14:50.384 --> 14:53.618
willing, and able to pull me to safety.

14:53.686 --> 14:57.155
I rest in peace now knowing that
my family will forever be

14:57.224 --> 15:00.192
in your warm, protective embrace.

15:00.261 --> 15:04.096
See you on the other side, my brother.
Love, Tommy.

15:05.033 --> 15:09.487
P.S. Don't let Janet
sleep with Franco."

15:16.480 --> 15:19.148
Ah, you're such an asshole.

15:27.224 --> 15:28.890
Hey, Gavin, where's your uni?

15:28.959 --> 15:32.193
You know what, today's not the day
to bust my balls, ok, ride-along?

15:32.262 --> 15:34.995
Yeah, well, you know what, the shift
started 10 minutes ago. You're late.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.763
Yeah, well, I had a little
family emergency, ok?

15:36.832 --> 15:37.831
Yeah, well, what's new?

15:37.900 --> 15:40.306
Next time, leave it at home.
We got work to do around here, ok?

15:40.426 --> 15:42.669
You know, you're acting
like a real douchebag.

15:42.738 --> 15:44.461
Yeah? Well, it takes one to know one.

15:44.581 --> 15:46.244
So after you're done with your little
milk-and-cookie break,

15:46.364 --> 15:47.851
Opie, I expect you to hop in uni.

15:50.946 --> 15:53.848
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo.

15:56.819 --> 15:59.420
Hey. I swear to God.
He's called me Fonzie.

15:59.489 --> 16:02.022
He's called me Opie. He mentions Eddie
Haskell to me, and I'm gonna rip

16:02.091 --> 16:04.525
his head off. What the hell's going on?
All I want is power bars.

16:04.594 --> 16:08.576
Everything's labeled.
What-- crackers...dirty bowls.

16:10.321 --> 16:12.567
Aw, thanks, man.

16:12.636 --> 16:13.868
And it's not just here.

16:13.937 --> 16:16.904
The same thing at home. They're busting
my balls. Katy, Colleen, Janet,

16:16.973 --> 16:19.540
'cause they're afraid I'm gonna blow
up the wedding, you know.

16:19.609 --> 16:21.675
And Sheila won't even look me in the
eyes 'cause she's all pissed off

16:21.744 --> 16:24.661
about the, uh, you know, the...

16:30.438 --> 16:32.147
What's wrong? What's going on?

16:33.320 --> 16:34.793
What's with the look?

16:40.928 --> 16:44.664
Lou, I know all your looks.
This is not one of your looks.

16:44.733 --> 16:47.819
This is a new look.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.598
Somebody die?

16:58.983 --> 17:01.372
Knock it off.

17:03.222 --> 17:05.153
Hey.

17:20.037 --> 17:21.002
Let's go, let's go!

17:21.070 --> 17:23.105
All right.
We can go underneath.

17:23.174 --> 17:24.006
All right, come on, guys.

17:24.075 --> 17:25.708
We gotta get this guy out of here.
Let's move!

17:25.776 --> 17:26.474
Nah, we gotta get underneath.

17:26.544 --> 17:28.077
Frankie, we're gonna need a chain
and yank it the hell back.

17:28.146 --> 17:29.225
We don't have time.
The rig can't get an angle. Let's move.

17:29.345 --> 17:31.914
- Frankie, listen to me.
- Hey, what are you doing?

17:33.117 --> 17:35.956
Aah! Jesus Christ!

17:36.076 --> 17:38.191
Shit! Damn it.

17:39.223 --> 17:40.456
Franco, come on!

17:40.524 --> 17:43.192
Geez. Guys, we need the chain.
Get the chain right away.

17:43.261 --> 17:45.570
Hook it up and back this bastard
out of here.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.630
You want to bark
some orders now, hero?

17:47.698 --> 17:48.664
Shut up, Lou.

17:48.733 --> 17:49.698
Nice move, bowels.

17:49.767 --> 17:51.901
Aah, come on!

17:51.969 --> 17:53.068
Let's hurry up, guys!

17:53.137 --> 17:55.136
Move, move, move.

17:55.205 --> 17:58.022
Come on, man.

18:01.245 --> 18:02.478
All right.

18:06.617 --> 18:07.617
Come on, pull, pull!

18:07.685 --> 18:08.518
All right, all right.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.552
You got it.

18:09.621 --> 18:12.122
All right, everybody, clear, clear.
Get out of the way.

18:19.665 --> 18:22.826
All right, get him out of there, guys.
How's he looking?

18:24.531 --> 18:25.574
He's all right.

18:25.694 --> 18:26.676
All right?

18:26.796 --> 18:28.705
He's fine.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.873
Oh, boy.

18:30.942 --> 18:32.608
- You all right, Lou?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

18:32.677 --> 18:35.978
- Lou, look, I was just trying--
- No, no, don't, don't, all right, Franco?

18:36.046 --> 18:38.313
You want to play Superman to
save face in front

18:38.382 --> 18:40.415
of these guys, you do it at
your own expense.

18:40.484 --> 18:42.017
Lou, look, it was
just my instinct, ok?

18:42.085 --> 18:44.786
A good lieutenant does not
make a call like that

18:44.855 --> 18:48.623
without thinking, Franco, ok?
That's why you don't wear the blue shirt.

18:48.691 --> 18:51.025
That's why when we get back to
the house, you're taking it off,

18:51.094 --> 18:53.277
or I'm gonna rip it off you and
feed it to you.

18:53.397 --> 18:56.891
Everybody back on the rig. We're goin'
home, and I'm riding shotgun.

19:02.537 --> 19:03.837
Hi.

19:03.905 --> 19:05.038
What?

19:05.106 --> 19:12.543
See, you're A-Rod, he's Jeter.
You go for the glory, he goes for the win.

19:12.612 --> 19:14.412
Oh, yeah, like Tommy Gavin
doesn't go for the glory every

19:14.481 --> 19:16.314
time he hops in the goddamn rig?

19:16.382 --> 19:18.916
Ok, what Tommy understands
and you fail to realize,

19:18.984 --> 19:23.621
firefighter Rivera, is there
ain't no glory, all right?

19:23.689 --> 19:25.112
Get your ass in the truck.

19:27.094 --> 19:32.020
Yeah. Get your ass in the truck.
Hee hee hee.

19:33.801 --> 19:35.034
What did I do?

19:35.103 --> 19:36.636
What did I do?

19:42.419 --> 19:43.201
Sheel.

19:43.321 --> 19:44.068
You brought stuff.

19:44.134 --> 19:45.242
Hey, honey, how are you?

19:45.302 --> 19:46.281
Good.

19:46.306 --> 19:47.072
Damian.

19:47.192 --> 19:48.093
What's happening?

19:48.156 --> 19:49.673
Nothing. Just have a seat.

19:49.793 --> 19:56.568
Put your gorgeous little self down there.
I have a demonstration for you.

19:56.637 --> 19:58.003
Get this right.

19:58.072 --> 20:02.270
Just sit and you watch and listen.

20:04.845 --> 20:11.595
Now, this is a glass
of vodka to you and I.

20:12.437 --> 20:17.184
But to Tommy, this is what it is...

20:19.170 --> 20:22.633
A great big shot of fire.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.532
Even when it's not swirling
around his incredibly screwed up

20:26.600 --> 20:29.738
system, even when it's stuck
inside the glass,

20:30.228 --> 20:33.471
it's still a raging inferno for him.

20:33.540 --> 20:36.741
So that night when he poured
himself a drink that he actually

20:36.810 --> 20:39.377
never drank, it didn't matter.

20:39.446 --> 20:45.646
Something inside of him-- it snapped,
made his mind begin to rumble,

20:46.289 --> 20:53.040
start him rummaging through your stuff
looking for answers, information, evidence.

20:54.081 --> 20:58.161
Now we both know that the mind
of Tommy Gavin is a mind filled

20:58.229 --> 21:10.294
with very, very dark alleyways and
terribly violent ideas and images and urges,

21:11.712 --> 21:17.883
but it's also the place where his best
instincts reside, like saving people.

21:25.826 --> 21:32.964
Stephan Dumont. Tommy pulled him
out of a burning car. 1987.

21:33.033 --> 21:34.399
Otherwise...

21:42.143 --> 21:47.814
Charlene Hanlon.
Tommy carried her dead down 10 flights of

21:47.883 --> 21:55.238
stairs, revives her on the sidewalk.
1990. Today, she's a teacher.

21:56.010 --> 21:58.359
Without Tommy...

22:05.034 --> 22:11.346
This is a list of at least 35
other people, Sheel--

22:12.249 --> 22:15.414
people who are still here on earth with
us 'cause of Tommy.

22:16.332 --> 22:23.383
Mothers, fathers, sons, daughters,
cops, coaches.

22:34.713 --> 22:36.259
Damian.

22:38.335 --> 22:44.607
Tommy pulled him out of a fire
uptown before what happened happened.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.936
And if he hadn't
pulled him out,

22:47.242 --> 22:50.345
he would have been literally
a bag of bones.

22:52.616 --> 22:54.377
And you.

22:55.585 --> 22:58.986
Now, you know, you may curse
what he's done or not done

22:59.055 --> 23:05.310
since Jimmy died, but he saved you from
yourself just by being there.

23:16.639 --> 23:20.269
You know, Sheel, if I had a
magic wand

23:20.652 --> 23:24.930
and I could wave it over his head and I could
make him get out of this goddamn chair

23:25.190 --> 23:28.251
and go down to the corner
with me and have a burger,

23:28.320 --> 23:31.307
you know that I would, but I can't.

23:34.996 --> 23:39.343
But if Tommy hadn't have saved
him, he would already be dead.

23:40.261 --> 23:44.497
And without this kid, even in
this state,

23:45.446 --> 23:47.848
I think I'd be talking to an empty room.

23:50.955 --> 23:59.614
Now, look, our friend Tommy has
been writing lately--

23:59.682 --> 24:10.179
letters: one to Janet, one to me, one
to each of the kids, and to you.

24:11.961 --> 24:16.549
Now, under no circumstances is
anyone allowed to even open these,

24:16.669 --> 24:22.699
and it is only in the event of his
death that we can actually read them.

24:28.443 --> 24:30.376
This is yours.

24:41.890 --> 24:43.230
I read mine already.

24:43.350 --> 24:45.559
I couldn't help it, Sheel.
I mean, it was staring at me and

24:45.628 --> 24:46.952
I had to read it, and I...

24:50.013 --> 24:51.942
I had tears in my eyes when I did.

24:53.404 --> 24:57.568
It was the first time I think he's ever
been honest about our friendship.

24:59.573 --> 25:01.743
It made me realize
how much I loved the guy and how

25:01.812 --> 25:09.420
much I owe him.
It just really put things...in perspective.

25:10.477 --> 25:12.666
I think maybe you
should do the same.

25:13.704 --> 25:16.673
You know, he's been calling me
Derek Jeter lately

25:16.793 --> 25:21.400
'cause he says I lead by example without
being a showoff.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.233
Well, I tell you one thing, if I'm Derek
Jeter, then he's--I mean, he's

25:25.302 --> 25:29.075
Mickey Mantle.
He's the great home run hitter.

25:29.195 --> 25:34.111
He's the maniac that--the
golden bad boy who's gonna

25:34.815 --> 25:36.621
turn it around before it all ends.

25:36.741 --> 25:39.115
Hey, why don't you leave that?
I think I'm gonna need it.

25:39.184 --> 25:41.417
Actually, it's lighter fluid.

25:41.486 --> 25:47.678
Otherwise, I couldn't get the
eternal flame effect that I wanted.

25:49.439 --> 25:53.328
Tommy would drink it, but most humans...

26:00.503 --> 26:03.505
Give him another shot, Sheel.

26:03.574 --> 26:07.343
I mean, he's the Mick.
He deserves that.

26:21.526 --> 26:24.361
Tell me what to do...

26:28.898 --> 26:32.669
"My dearest Sheel, if you
are reading these words,

26:32.738 --> 26:36.535
it means our time together is
done and far too soon--

26:36.872 --> 26:40.863
our time on earth. I cannot express what
you meant to me,

26:41.215 --> 26:43.512
what our time together was worth.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.298
Hey, that rhymes.

26:47.308 --> 26:48.287
Sorry.

26:49.267 --> 26:53.923
I just cannot begin to say the things I wish
'cause I'm not good enough at that. So,

26:54.614 --> 26:59.196
allow me to choose a
few small but meaningful words:

26:59.265 --> 27:06.941
Love, lips, heat, hope.
All these things you gave me.

27:07.064 --> 27:11.029
You saved me from myself.
And wherever you go,

27:11.090 --> 27:16.847
whatever you do, know that I will be there
ever so gently, ever so true,

27:16.916 --> 27:20.959
brushing up against your
brown skin, saving you."

27:23.115 --> 27:28.139
"I don't have an ending for this.
Love, Tommy.

27:29.502 --> 27:33.598
P.S. In case I forgot to tell
you, there's like 25 bottles of

27:33.667 --> 27:36.635
really, really expensive wine in
3 wooden boxes

27:36.703 --> 27:39.171
in the back of your bedroom closet behind
some old suitcases. I found them

27:39.239 --> 27:41.507
there when I was searching for
Jimmy's letter. I didn't touch

27:41.576 --> 27:44.010
any of them because they looked
really expensive plus I already

27:44.078 --> 27:46.312
had that bottle of vodka, and
red wine always kind of made me

27:46.381 --> 27:47.647
gag a little when I sipped it.

27:47.716 --> 27:49.082
But I know you love wine.

27:49.151 --> 27:51.884
Figured maybe you forgot about
'em after you moved into that place.

27:52.313 --> 27:55.590
Ok. Love you forever.

27:55.659 --> 27:56.825
Bye."

28:06.535 --> 28:09.403
This is a glass of vodka.

28:09.472 --> 28:11.005
I see that.

28:11.073 --> 28:12.764
To you and I.

28:13.178 --> 28:19.692
But once it enters Tommy Gavin's
brain, it becomes this

28:19.799 --> 28:24.285
eternal flame just kind of feeding on itself.
Don't worry, Janet.

28:24.354 --> 28:25.587
Could you put that out, please?

28:25.707 --> 28:29.124
It's all right. Don't worry about it.
I was an amateur magician in high school.

28:29.193 --> 28:30.192
The Magnificent Ken.

28:30.261 --> 28:31.394
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:31.514 --> 28:32.373
With fire?

28:32.493 --> 28:35.380
Yeah, with fire. Flaming cards, flaming
knives, disappearing birds.

28:35.500 --> 28:36.699
I did it to impress the girls.

28:36.819 --> 28:42.819
But I'm here today to
remind you of something.

28:45.503 --> 28:47.574
- Are you sure that that is safe?
- Don't worry.

28:50.003 --> 28:55.019
Stephan Dumont. Tommy pulled him
out of a burning car. 1987.

28:55.087 --> 28:56.820
Otherwise...

29:07.106 --> 29:09.232
Charlene Hanlon.

29:09.301 --> 29:13.537
Tommy carried her dead down 10 flights
of stairs, revived her

29:13.606 --> 29:16.340
n the street. Today, she's a teacher.

29:23.582 --> 29:25.275
- Uh, Lou...
- Yeah.

29:25.395 --> 29:26.617
Lou, fire!

29:26.685 --> 29:27.384
Yeah.

29:27.453 --> 29:29.186
Oh, Lou!

29:29.255 --> 29:31.589
Fire!

29:31.657 --> 29:35.459
You got a--

29:35.528 --> 29:36.727
Hit my arm.

29:36.796 --> 29:38.362
Oh!

29:45.833 --> 29:47.761
Yeah.

29:48.848 --> 29:50.342
Lou?

29:50.411 --> 29:51.510
Yeah.

29:51.579 --> 29:52.912
Are you ok?

29:52.981 --> 29:55.314
Yeah, I'm ok.

29:55.383 --> 30:00.653
Look, you know, I only came over here
to tell you that Tommy's job, it--

30:03.525 --> 30:05.625
The only 2 words that I want to
hear from Tommy

30:05.745 --> 30:08.193
regarding 62 truck are "I quit."

30:18.893 --> 30:19.454
Hey.

30:19.574 --> 30:20.482
Hey.

30:21.169 --> 30:25.556
You're looking awful perky at
what might be my own personal

30:25.676 --> 30:27.501
Armageddon potentially.

30:27.570 --> 30:28.469
Should be interesting.

30:28.538 --> 30:29.570
Tom, Tom, come on, come on.

30:29.639 --> 30:30.638
Yes.

30:30.707 --> 30:33.175
- Hey.
- Come on. Meet my brothers.

30:33.244 --> 30:35.878
Hey, Needles.
Come meet my brothers.

30:35.946 --> 30:38.680
D'Brickshaw, Molique, Jose.

30:38.749 --> 30:39.715
Hey, how you doing?

30:39.784 --> 30:40.782
- What's up, man?
- What's going on?

30:40.902 --> 30:42.848
Jose? Where'd they
come up with that one?

30:42.968 --> 30:45.487
You just got introduced to 2
guys named "D" apostrophe

30:45.556 --> 30:48.224
Brickshaw and Molique with a "q".
And you're asking

30:48.292 --> 30:53.229
about Jose? White folks, man!
Got some curious-ass crackers.

30:53.298 --> 30:54.497
Sounds about right.

30:54.566 --> 30:56.566
He's a little touchy
about his name.

30:56.635 --> 30:59.001
Forget the name. What about the colors?
One guy's jet black,

30:59.070 --> 31:02.104
the other guy's mocha,
and Molique--very beige.

31:02.173 --> 31:04.653
Black rainbow, brother. Black rainbow.

31:04.773 --> 31:08.704
Wait till you meet my daddy.
He's got a midnight shade thing going on.

31:11.224 --> 31:12.846
That's the thing about black
people, you know?

31:12.907 --> 31:15.350
They have the one color and then all these
other colors going on with the

31:15.419 --> 31:17.886
one color, you know, like Obama.

31:17.955 --> 31:22.024
I mean, he's kind of got a lavender
lip thing going on, you know?

31:27.632 --> 31:28.946
Wasn't that funny.

31:30.268 --> 31:31.967
Come here.

31:32.036 --> 31:33.102
What?

31:33.171 --> 31:34.603
Come here. Come on, come on.

31:34.672 --> 31:36.972
What are you? Hey!

31:37.041 --> 31:38.112
- You know.
- What?

31:38.232 --> 31:40.509
You know.

31:40.578 --> 31:43.459
Hey, man. Geez!

31:45.582 --> 31:48.052
How you holding up?

31:48.389 --> 31:54.153
I'm holding up fine.
What are you doing here?

31:54.475 --> 31:57.158
What am I doing here?

31:57.227 --> 31:59.436
Classic.

32:06.770 --> 32:09.071
Hey.

32:09.140 --> 32:10.806
Hi.

32:10.875 --> 32:13.810
Hi.

32:13.879 --> 32:15.178
Hi.

32:15.247 --> 32:19.683
Mmm.

32:19.752 --> 32:21.051
All right?

32:21.120 --> 32:22.019
Yeah.

32:23.022 --> 32:25.589
Hey, everybody, can I
get your attention?

32:25.658 --> 32:28.825
Can we sit down?
Colleen has something to say.

32:28.894 --> 32:32.540
Hi, everyone. Ha ha!

32:32.660 --> 32:36.415
Ok, so I just wanted to make a
little toast

32:37.808 --> 32:40.212
to the love of my life Shawn.

32:40.763 --> 32:45.232
You are the greatest
boyfriend a girl could ever ask for.

32:45.829 --> 32:50.581
And I know you're gonna
make the most wonderful husband

32:50.649 --> 32:51.946
a girl could ever ask for.

32:52.066 --> 32:53.461
Nice.

32:57.239 --> 33:01.840
- And to the other love of my life, my dad...
- Aww...

33:03.350 --> 33:05.434
who's just...

33:07.268 --> 33:08.801
I love you, daddy.

33:08.870 --> 33:11.204
Thank you for everything.

33:11.272 --> 33:12.672
Yay!

33:17.912 --> 33:19.678
Well, that was nice.

33:25.750 --> 33:27.686
What?

33:27.755 --> 33:29.729
Nothing.

33:32.660 --> 33:34.769
Do I got something on
my face or something?

33:34.889 --> 33:36.575
No. Come here.

33:36.896 --> 33:38.615
Huh.

33:40.802 --> 33:42.844
Now you do.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.639
Ok.

33:48.910 --> 33:50.744
You all right?

33:50.812 --> 33:53.442
I have never been better.

33:53.670 --> 33:56.270
Ok. All right.

33:58.174 --> 33:59.808
All right, it's my turn.

33:59.877 --> 34:06.815
I just want to say as Tommy's chief and
one of his oldest pals, he's the best.

34:06.884 --> 34:12.755
He's the best firefighter, the
best pal, the best father.

34:12.824 --> 34:15.123
Tommy, you're the best.

34:15.193 --> 34:16.059
Salud!

34:16.127 --> 34:17.127
Tommy.

34:17.195 --> 34:18.527
Tommy.

34:18.597 --> 34:19.696
Whoo hoo!

34:19.764 --> 34:24.668
Hey, and can the Gavins add to that?
Godspeed, Tom.

34:24.735 --> 34:29.472
May the road rise up to meet you and may
the wind always be at your back.

34:31.920 --> 34:36.245
You know, I'd like to say
something if I could.

34:36.313 --> 34:39.949
Um...Just for a sec.

34:44.655 --> 34:47.922
What's going on?

34:47.992 --> 34:50.025
Huh?

34:50.094 --> 34:53.462
Ever since I walked in this joint
tonight, everybody's being

34:53.531 --> 35:03.641
very nice to me and saying very,
very caring and nice stuff,

35:03.709 --> 35:07.979
and it just don't add up.

35:08.048 --> 35:11.248
So, what gives?

35:12.988 --> 35:15.148
What, do I have cancer or something,
honey? What's--

35:15.268 --> 35:18.025
- Tommy. No.
- You know...

35:18.094 --> 35:21.028
Ok, is somebody gonna shoot me again?
Is that what--hey, hey!

35:21.097 --> 35:24.031
I'm just reaching for a roll, Tom.
Come on.

35:24.099 --> 35:30.490
Honey, hon, um... well, Lou gave me the
letter that you wrote, ok?

35:30.536 --> 35:36.508
And I took the liberty of telling the kids
and actually, well, everyone

35:36.576 --> 35:38.552
about your promise.

35:40.413 --> 35:43.881
My promise?

35:43.950 --> 35:47.018
To retire from the
Fire Department.

35:52.326 --> 35:56.296
I am so proud of you.

35:56.365 --> 36:00.300
And everyone, the letter was so,
so darling because he knows that

36:00.369 --> 36:03.470
he has such messy handwriting and
I can't read it, so he typed it.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.407
Thank you, baby.
Thank you so much.

36:07.476 --> 36:08.509
You're welcome.

36:08.577 --> 36:09.977
Yeah.

36:16.218 --> 36:19.186
I typed it?

36:19.255 --> 36:21.622
Hmm.

36:21.690 --> 36:27.553
How many other people in the room
tonight received a letter from me from Lou?

36:28.425 --> 36:31.198
2, 3, 4, 5. Hmm.

36:31.267 --> 36:33.500
Interesting. Ha ha.

36:37.240 --> 36:40.942
- Lou?
- Yeah, I'm eating.

36:41.010 --> 36:43.478
Can I see you outside, please?

36:43.546 --> 36:46.235
Yeah... now?

36:48.270 --> 36:49.951
Yeah, I'm coming.

36:55.725 --> 36:58.725
Now!

36:58.794 --> 37:00.460
Make sure no one eats this.

37:06.853 --> 37:09.103
I told you how many times?

37:09.172 --> 37:11.305
It's a very simple task.

37:11.374 --> 37:13.441
Not difficult.

37:13.510 --> 37:17.613
Very definite plan of attack.

37:17.681 --> 37:21.250
Man, did you try that risotto?
It was out of this world.

37:21.319 --> 37:24.086
Whew! That stuff was good.
I think they put a little

37:24.155 --> 37:25.820
something special in there.
It might have been, like, a white

37:25.889 --> 37:29.057
truffle oil. I'm not sure, but...
Oh, all right, Tom.

37:29.126 --> 37:31.559
I went to Sheila's and I gave
her the letter because

37:31.628 --> 37:33.661
I knew that she was totally pissed at
you, all right? And look.

37:33.730 --> 37:36.765
I mean, it turned everything around.
Same thing

37:36.833 --> 37:39.000
that your letter did to me.
And then I knew that Janet wanted

37:39.069 --> 37:42.837
to kill you, so I went over there and I
gave her the letter. Except--

37:42.905 --> 37:47.108
Long story short.
I ended up setting that letter on fire.

37:47.176 --> 37:49.836
I'm sorry. Tom, I realized I
couldn't handle the pressure anymore.

37:49.956 --> 37:51.400
I mean, what if I lost the letters?

37:51.520 --> 37:54.430
What if they flew out the window or God
knows what happened, you know?

37:54.550 --> 37:57.718
And so I gave them to everybody like you
told me to, and I told them

37:57.786 --> 38:00.586
not to read them.
And look, everybody's happy.

38:00.655 --> 38:02.833
I didn't give them to the regular guys,
though.

38:04.685 --> 38:06.889
You know, you don't see molding
like that anymore.

38:08.330 --> 38:10.330
Molding?

38:10.399 --> 38:11.598
You want to talk about molding?

38:11.666 --> 38:13.866
No, not really.

38:13.935 --> 38:15.627
- Are you done?
- No, I'm not done.

38:16.097 --> 38:19.828
I'm thinking about what Janet said,
and I think you should quit.

38:23.611 --> 38:24.610
You think I should quit?

38:24.679 --> 38:26.178
Yeah.

38:26.247 --> 38:28.615
Ok.

38:28.683 --> 38:31.184
Were you not in
that room just now?

38:31.304 --> 38:33.287
Yeah, I was there.

38:33.356 --> 38:36.524
When Janet announced that I quit?
When Janet announced

38:36.592 --> 38:39.260
to my entire family that I quit?
Not to mention all the black people

38:39.329 --> 38:41.779
that are about to marry into the family.
I got news for you,

38:41.899 --> 38:44.432
it's over. I'm done. I have no job.

38:44.501 --> 38:48.869
I have no job, and I owe 10
grand on a wedding dress! Ok?

38:48.938 --> 38:53.941
Not to mention the thousands and
thousands of dollars in risotto

38:54.009 --> 38:57.877
that Laqueefa and America are
currently scarfing down.

38:57.946 --> 38:59.096
- Shameerica.
- What?

38:59.216 --> 39:01.362
- Shameeri--
- Shut up! Shut up.

39:03.918 --> 39:08.487
I asked you to do one simple thing, ok?
That's all. I die--

39:08.556 --> 39:12.791
I die, and you release the letters.
Ok? That's it.

39:12.860 --> 39:17.529
I pass away, and you release the letters.
Death letters.

39:17.598 --> 39:19.264
Death letters.

39:19.333 --> 39:23.503
Do you hear any wiggle room
in there, Lou? Huh? No.

39:23.571 --> 39:25.939
Look, Tom, you know what, I
wanted to do something.

39:26.007 --> 39:27.841
I wanted to help. I wanted to do
something that you couldn't,

39:27.910 --> 39:30.377
Tom, which was to express how
you really feel about people

39:30.446 --> 39:32.809
while they're still alive.

39:34.384 --> 39:38.386
And so I burned the first one,
so I wrote another letter

39:38.455 --> 39:40.688
to Janet from you, and I put
everything in there

39:40.757 --> 39:43.791
that I thought you wanted to say to
her, and I think I did

39:43.860 --> 39:46.193
a great job and everybody's happy.

39:46.262 --> 39:47.494
So you can thank me later.

39:47.563 --> 39:49.296
Ah, don't--don't walk away.

39:49.364 --> 39:51.169
No, no, no, no, no.

39:55.903 --> 40:00.205
You have broke a sacred bond.

40:00.274 --> 40:05.678
You were entrusted with the
final wishes of a dead man,

40:05.747 --> 40:08.748
pretty heavy shit when you think about it.

40:09.406 --> 40:11.075
And you dug me a hole that I

40:11.195 --> 40:13.519
probably will never
be able to climb out of.

40:13.588 --> 40:15.455
Well, you know what, it's
better than a hole in the

40:15.524 --> 40:17.757
ground, pal, because there
ain't no digging out of that.

40:17.826 --> 40:21.695
And you know what, Tom, I broke
your trust and I'm sorry. Ok?

40:21.764 --> 40:26.968
But I mean, look on the bright side.
You bite it now, everyone's on your side.

40:27.036 --> 40:30.806
Tom, you should just--you should just quit.
You put in your 20.

40:30.874 --> 40:33.426
You don't need to prove anything anymore.

40:33.687 --> 40:37.213
You think about other
people for once besides yourself.

40:37.281 --> 40:38.481
Ok.

40:41.619 --> 40:43.987
You're a traitor. Yeah.

40:44.056 --> 40:46.422
I gave you one simple task to
do, and you somehow twisted it

40:46.491 --> 40:48.024
and turned it around against me.

40:48.092 --> 40:51.473
Ok? All those nice things I said
in the letter about

40:51.593 --> 40:53.437
how you were the brother I never had?

40:54.798 --> 40:56.131
Scratch it.

40:57.902 --> 41:00.436
The only difference between you
and my brother Johnny

41:00.505 --> 41:03.972
is that you never hit on my wife.

41:04.041 --> 41:10.112
So...You want to hear how I
feel, have me express

41:10.180 --> 41:12.781
my feelings while I'm still
walking around alive?

41:12.850 --> 41:14.472
- Yeah, why not, Tom?
- Here we go. Ready?

41:14.592 --> 41:16.017
Yeah.

41:16.086 --> 41:18.018
You're not Derek Jeter.

41:18.087 --> 41:21.055
You're not even Joe
goddamn Pepitone.

41:21.123 --> 41:23.658
You know what you are?

41:23.726 --> 41:25.226
Judas.

41:25.295 --> 41:26.261
That's who you are.

41:26.329 --> 41:27.642
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

41:27.762 --> 41:30.887
And that would make you... Jesus?

41:31.836 --> 41:33.036
So funny.

41:33.104 --> 41:34.537
So funny.

41:38.544 --> 41:41.021
Don't think I'm not coming in for dessert...

41:44.189 --> 41:45.490
'Cause I am.

41:46.305 --> 41:52.781
