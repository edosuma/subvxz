WEBVTT

00:05.076 --> 00:06.372
Previously on E.R.

00:06.756 --> 00:09.232
I'm Abby. I'll be your OB nurse.

00:09.233 --> 00:11.523
I just can't lie about a diagnosis.

00:11.524 --> 00:13.761
Sometimes we make what's
call a judgment call.

00:13.874 --> 00:16.023
If the rules need to bent a little,
then we bend them.

00:16.024 --> 00:17.342
You wanna go grab some dinner?

00:17.343 --> 00:19.436
Peter, you asked me out?

00:20.253 --> 00:22.289
It's never been very easy for me to be here.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.065
That's something I know about.

00:25.978 --> 00:29.029
E.R. 6x12 "ABBY ROAD"

00:29.691 --> 00:34.104
One minute I'm freezing, the next
I'm burning up. I can't keep things down.

00:34.321 --> 00:36.444
Sir, it's the flu.
It's going around.

00:36.657 --> 00:41.568
I got body aches, nasty cough.
I really need to see a doctor.

00:43.247 --> 00:47.873
- Sit, we'll get to you in a minute.
- You said that an hour ago.

00:48.085 --> 00:51.419
- I need to go home.
- Forget it. We're shorthanded.

00:51.630 --> 00:55.296
- I puked. I gotta go.
- So did half the Radiology techs.

00:55.509 --> 00:58.464
- I've got a fever. Feel my head.
- Feel your own.

00:58.679 --> 01:02.926
- Cold and flu season has hit hard.
- Yes, take your pick.

01:03.142 --> 01:05.515
Fever, sore throats, runny noses...

01:05.687 --> 01:08.688
...aches and vomiting.
Why don't they go home?

01:08.898 --> 01:11.769
- It's coming out both ends.
- Thanks, Dave.

01:11.985 --> 01:17.324
The lab is full. It takes four hours
to get a CBC. They're 40 behind.

01:17.532 --> 01:20.284
- You look bad.
- I look better than I feel.

01:20.494 --> 01:25.535
No beds, we're boarding 7 patients.
Carol called in 2 registry nurses.

01:25.707 --> 01:28.199
God only knows
when they'll get here.

01:28.419 --> 01:30.376
You should see a doctor.

01:30.587 --> 01:33.043
Me too, or I'll expose the patients.

01:33.257 --> 01:36.377
Take some Imodium.
Wear a mask.

01:37.219 --> 01:40.386
- You touch the thermostat?
- I just cleaned it.

01:40.556 --> 01:42.632
- Hello, Mark.
- Good morning.

01:42.850 --> 01:45.970
- Did you run the faucets?
- Yes, it was freezing.

01:46.187 --> 01:48.643
I had to boil water to wash my hair.

01:48.856 --> 01:51.857
- I need a plumber.
- Let me look at it again.

01:52.068 --> 01:56.196
A plumber will try to sell you
a new one. It's old, not dead.

01:56.906 --> 01:57.986
What?

01:58.158 --> 02:02.025
- Kovac is fixing your water heater?
- Trying to fix it.

02:02.412 --> 02:04.405
He was dropping me off.

02:04.623 --> 02:08.288
From work. I was complaining it
was making some noise-

02:08.502 --> 02:10.660
- Why am I explaining?
- Beats me.

02:10.878 --> 02:12.836
- Don't think that.
- Think what?

02:13.048 --> 02:15.088
- It's not that.
- It's not what?

02:15.259 --> 02:17.417
It's not anything.

02:18.804 --> 02:21.591
- Move back, now.
- Coming through.

02:22.099 --> 02:23.743
- If you've got the flu...
- Hi.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.052
...is too late for a flu shot.

02:26.270 --> 02:30.398
- I'm Abby, they're expecting me.
- ER, please hold. Please hold.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.730
Abby.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.110
- Did they send you here?
- Yeah.

02:36.322 --> 02:39.608
I was wondering when we
were gonna get some help.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.827
- Carol.
- Hathaway!

02:42.037 --> 02:44.954
- You were my OB nurse.
- Twins. How are they?

02:45.165 --> 02:48.166
They sleep well,
just not at the same time.

02:48.376 --> 02:49.787
How do you do it?

02:50.003 --> 02:53.123
Not easy, but neither
is managing 36 patients.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.799
- Actually-
- Coming by!

02:55.008 --> 02:57.582
I found this guy.
He can't walk.

02:57.803 --> 03:01.338
- What's open, Carol?
- If you can find a bed, grab it.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.799
- Sorry.
- Call Housekeeping!

03:03.976 --> 03:07.511
Med students think we're
their maids. We're swamped.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.221
- Actually-
- Chest film for Mr. Sranski.

03:10.441 --> 03:11.816
- Sranski?
- Flu patient.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.599
- You need scrubs.
- No. I don't think-

03:14.821 --> 03:17.490
- Haleh, do we have scrubs?
- I don't care.

03:17.657 --> 03:18.819
We do get along.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.990
- You believe in zombies?
- What?

03:21.202 --> 03:24.903
Human cadavers walking the earth
after they've died?

03:25.123 --> 03:27.661
- No.
- There's a body still in Exam 1.

03:27.834 --> 03:32.496
- I called Transport.
- Piggyback it out. I need the bed.

03:32.672 --> 03:35.246
- Residents, worse than students.
- Right.

03:35.467 --> 03:37.258
Can somebody take this?

03:37.469 --> 03:40.505
- Did you call ahead?
- Yes. Todd Sullivan.

03:40.722 --> 03:43.474
Good vitals.
He crashed while sledding.

03:43.684 --> 03:47.598
- I lost my teeth.
- Don't worry, they're your baby teeth.

03:47.813 --> 03:51.016
- Malik, can you call a doc?
- Right. Good luck.

03:51.192 --> 03:54.027
He needs a C-spine
and a head CT.

03:54.236 --> 03:56.906
- We need a doc to order it.
- I can do it.

03:57.114 --> 04:00.199
- What?
- Students work on patients, right?

04:00.409 --> 04:04.028
- I'm a 3rd-year. This is my rotation.
- A med student?

04:04.205 --> 04:08.452
Yes. What can I say?
I crossed over to the dark side.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:59.596 --> 05:02.513
Films are clear.
I paged an oral surgeon.

05:02.724 --> 05:05.429
- Update his tetanus?
- He had it last year.

05:05.602 --> 05:09.931
- I guess not. I'm Luka Kovac.
- Abby Lockheart. I'm a third-year.

05:10.148 --> 05:12.188
Another new Resident?

05:12.401 --> 05:15.936
- I'm a med student.
- Another half gram of Ancef?

05:16.947 --> 05:19.485
- Abby?
- Sure. Sounds good.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.452
Okay. Nice job.

05:23.829 --> 05:26.403
We never had doctors
like that in OB.

05:26.624 --> 05:29.708
- Easy on the eyes?
- I'll say! Is he single?

05:29.919 --> 05:31.627
He doesn't talk about it.

05:31.838 --> 05:35.289
Tall, dark, handsome
and mysterious?

05:35.466 --> 05:37.293
- What are you doing?
- Cleaning.

05:37.468 --> 05:39.128
- I got it.
- Don't be silly.

05:39.304 --> 05:41.380
Really, I got it.

05:41.890 --> 05:43.135
Okay.

05:45.435 --> 05:46.894
Carol.

05:47.103 --> 05:50.769
- Can I see pictures of your girls?
- Sure.

05:53.610 --> 05:56.315
He has to take his pills every day.

05:56.530 --> 05:59.068
- He forgets.
- Maybe you can remind him.

05:59.283 --> 06:00.825
I forget.

06:01.034 --> 06:04.617
Put a note on your
medicine cabinet to remind you.

06:04.830 --> 06:08.282
That's a good idea.
I'll try to remember that.

06:08.501 --> 06:11.786
I'm feeling horrible.
Can you cover my shift?

06:12.004 --> 06:15.669
- Must be bad if you're sick.
- I'd rather die at home.

06:15.841 --> 06:19.092
Make sure the new student
doesn't kill anyone.

06:19.303 --> 06:22.507
- Leave her alone. Abby-
- Give me a break.

06:22.682 --> 06:23.713
Suck it up.

06:23.933 --> 06:26.424
Abby, meet Mark Greene, Attending.

06:26.644 --> 06:27.676
- We've met.
- Yes.

06:27.854 --> 06:30.226
See you tomorrow, if I live.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.931
- She wasn't wrong?
- I'm a med student.

06:33.151 --> 06:36.354
- And an OB nurse.
- I do it to pay the bills.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.068
Right. Welcome to the glorious ER.

06:39.282 --> 06:41.690
- Has anyone given you the tour?
- No.

06:41.910 --> 06:44.580
Start by signing up
for your patient.

06:44.788 --> 06:48.786
Grab a T-sheet based on complaint.
Nurses' orders go here.

06:49.001 --> 06:53.378
- Labs and x-rays go here. Questions?
- So far, so good.

06:53.589 --> 06:57.373
That's Curtain Area 1.
This is Area 2. Yosh Takata.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.544
- Wave hi to Yosh.
- Hi.

07:00.638 --> 07:03.176
- Trauma 1, Trauma 2. Haleh-
- We've met.

07:03.391 --> 07:06.096
- Hi. Still hurting, Todd?
- A little.

07:06.310 --> 07:09.644
We gave him 4 morphine.
Can we give him 2 more?

07:09.856 --> 07:12.264
- Yes. You need this tour?
- It helps.

07:12.484 --> 07:16.861
Come on. The tram doesn't stop.
Keep your hands and arms inside.

07:17.072 --> 07:18.103
What's this?

07:18.323 --> 07:22.570
Darnel Smith has muscular dystrophy.
Possible forearm fracture.

07:22.786 --> 07:25.906
- What happened?
- I was pushed down the stairs.

07:26.123 --> 07:28.115
- In your wheelchair?
- Duh!

07:28.333 --> 07:33.292
- It was a fight. Cleo has the pusher.
- Let's keep the two of them apart.

07:33.505 --> 07:34.750
- That's Carter.
- Yes.

07:34.923 --> 07:36.584
This is the Pedes ER.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.929
It's a large exam room with pediatric
equipment and murals.

07:41.097 --> 07:43.173
- Hey, Cleo.
- Hey.

07:44.266 --> 07:48.810
He freaked out on me in the hallway
when I tried to get past him.

07:49.021 --> 07:52.640
You can't push him down
the steps in a wheelchair.

07:52.859 --> 07:57.355
I didn't push the psycho
until he stabbed me with his pencil.

07:57.947 --> 08:00.984
- What are you looking at?
- Don't be rude.

08:01.451 --> 08:03.609
Good news.
His arm's not broken.

08:03.828 --> 08:07.447
I can't believe one of his
classmates would do this.

08:07.666 --> 08:09.789
I heard that he provoked it.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.459
- Darnel, is that true?
- No.

08:14.631 --> 08:18.795
- He's been acting up lately.
- Is he in special education?

08:18.969 --> 08:23.430
No, he's not. We wanted his life
to be as normal as possible.

08:23.641 --> 08:26.262
Got cancer?
They'll cut off your penis.

08:26.477 --> 08:28.304
- That's enough.
- Darnel!

08:28.521 --> 08:29.552
He's kidding.

08:29.772 --> 08:33.140
- Mrs. Henry, please wait in Chairs.
- Leave him here?

08:33.359 --> 08:35.731
I still need to check him.

08:35.945 --> 08:38.982
All right. You behave yourself.

08:39.198 --> 08:43.491
I'll be right out in the waiting room
if you need anything.

08:46.831 --> 08:51.209
Darnel, sounds like you're having
a little trouble in school.

08:52.337 --> 08:56.038
Is this because of your
muscular dystrophy?

08:57.968 --> 09:00.673
So, suddenly you don't speak.

09:00.888 --> 09:02.845
I can't feel my toes.

09:03.056 --> 09:06.342
You have frostbite.
Do we need to débride?

09:06.560 --> 09:10.605
- Is he a diabetic?
- No. He has a respiratory infection.

09:10.815 --> 09:14.978
The frostbite is superficial.
Start him on a rapid rewarm...

09:15.194 --> 09:18.148
- ...of 105 degree circulating water.
- Thanks.

09:18.364 --> 09:22.029
Is anybody not sick?
It's like the damn plague here.

09:22.201 --> 09:23.861
Are you here to help?

09:24.078 --> 09:29.203
It's natural selection. An epidemic
thins the herd. Where's Kerry?

09:29.417 --> 09:33.332
- She went home sick.
- That's why they're the weaker sex.

09:33.546 --> 09:35.338
You booked an O.R. for 3:00?

09:35.549 --> 09:39.498
Yes. I'm assisting Dr. Ashcoff
on a facial-scar revision.

09:39.719 --> 09:43.717
- Can't that be done in the Plastics?
- He wants general.

09:43.932 --> 09:45.213
How do you fit in?

09:45.392 --> 09:49.260
The girl's my patient.
I'm following up on a dog bite.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.725
Yeah, so?

09:50.939 --> 09:55.732
Medicaid won't cover it. I got Ashcoff
to donate his time. I was-

09:55.945 --> 09:58.799
We provide medical
services to the poor.

09:58.815 --> 10:02.863
Well, that does not include cosmetic surgery.
What's next, liposuction for fat kids?

10:02.977 --> 10:06.660
- A little girl is disfigured.
- Peter, I admire your noble effort.

10:06.873 --> 10:10.372
But this kind of thing
could lose our state funding.

10:10.585 --> 10:12.079
I'm sorry, big guy.

10:12.295 --> 10:15.213
Will I get lead poisoning
from the pencil?

10:15.423 --> 10:18.258
- Pencils are graphite.
- Temp's 99.2.

10:18.468 --> 10:21.919
- Did that hurt?
- No. It's just cold.

10:22.806 --> 10:24.466
Sorry.

10:29.271 --> 10:33.351
- How did you get these bruises?
- I don't know.

10:33.776 --> 10:35.768
Who hit you, Marty?

10:36.362 --> 10:38.734
- Some kids at school.
- Are you sure?

10:38.948 --> 10:41.024
Yeah, I'm sure.

10:41.242 --> 10:43.733
- Do your parents know about this?
- No.

10:43.953 --> 10:47.452
- The teachers or the principal?
- They'll kill me.

10:47.623 --> 10:49.532
What's this?

10:49.750 --> 10:52.158
- Mosquito bites.
- In February?

10:52.378 --> 10:55.463
They must be hungry.
You have quite a few.

10:55.632 --> 10:57.589
Look, is my dad coming?

10:57.800 --> 11:01.549
He's on his way.
I'll be back.

11:03.223 --> 11:07.801
Get a CBC, Chem-20, and a tox screen.
They're infected track marks.

11:07.978 --> 11:12.439
- What am I looking for?
- Top of page 4. It was a good morning.

11:12.649 --> 11:16.149
- I spotted it while reading the paper.
- What?

11:16.361 --> 11:18.983
For Pete's sake!

11:19.656 --> 11:22.942
"University of Chicago,
Department of Astrophysics...

11:23.160 --> 11:27.075
...will present a symposium. Guest
speakers include..."

11:27.289 --> 11:30.824
- Isabelle Corday. Your mother.
- Yes!

11:31.043 --> 11:34.827
- I see the resemblance.
- I look like my father.

11:35.131 --> 11:36.839
You didn't tell me.

11:37.049 --> 11:39.837
I didn't know.
It's so like her.

11:40.011 --> 11:43.795
- You guys having a fight?
- No, she's just being Mother.

11:44.015 --> 11:45.557
You should call her.

11:45.767 --> 11:49.218
Of course, come to her,
that's part of the game.

11:49.437 --> 11:52.688
- Or don't call her.
- I won't. I'm not playing.

11:52.858 --> 11:54.684
Get off me!
I'll kill you!

11:54.860 --> 11:56.318
I'll kill you!

11:56.528 --> 12:00.027
- Was he trying to hurt himself?
- No, he's freaked out.

12:00.198 --> 12:01.942
- On medication?
- Drugs!

12:02.159 --> 12:07.236
- Looks like PCP to me. What happened?
- He jumped out a third-story window.

12:07.456 --> 12:09.247
He didn't even feel it.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.866
He'll feel something soon.
Get out!

12:12.044 --> 12:15.045
- What are you doing?
- He needs to see this.

12:15.548 --> 12:16.579
Listen, we're trying to help.

12:16.799 --> 12:20.382
He's broken both legs, exposed bone.

12:20.553 --> 12:22.925
- Ever seen an open fracture?
- No.

12:23.139 --> 12:25.974
He's taching away.
Pulse is strong.

12:26.809 --> 12:29.727
Ten of Haldol, IM.
Get those restraints on.

12:30.188 --> 12:31.848
Get that out of here!

12:32.065 --> 12:34.936
- Please back up.
- No, this is too good.

12:35.151 --> 12:39.979
- Now!
- CBC, tox screen, UA and a myoglobin!

12:40.574 --> 12:42.862
- Haldol now!
- Restraints or Haldol?

12:43.076 --> 12:47.240
- I got it.
- Tetanus booster and a gram of Ancef!

12:47.414 --> 12:49.490
Okay, roll him.

12:49.708 --> 12:52.282
Give it in the thigh interior.

12:57.258 --> 12:58.800
- You okay?
- Yeah.

12:59.427 --> 13:02.214
Set me up for P.M. splints!

13:07.435 --> 13:11.599
- You've had Heptovax?
- Yes, but patients don't bite in OB.

13:11.814 --> 13:14.732
It's an occupational hazard down here.

13:15.151 --> 13:18.520
Serologies will be back tomorrow.
Don't sweat it.

13:18.738 --> 13:20.945
You're your own teaching case.

13:21.157 --> 13:24.242
Well, I expected the ER
to be different.

13:24.452 --> 13:26.825
Stop squirming and I'll get it in.

13:27.038 --> 13:29.364
- You're being rough.
- Stop whining.

13:29.541 --> 13:32.542
Be glad she's not putting in a Foley.

13:33.170 --> 13:38.295
Once you've been bitten by a raving
lunatic, you're ready to see patients.

13:38.509 --> 13:39.884
I don't know.

13:40.094 --> 13:43.842
Grab a chart.
And yell if you get into trouble.

13:44.473 --> 13:47.225
- Carol, keep an eye on her?
- Sure.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.344
Oh, and update her tetanus.

13:53.232 --> 13:57.147
Press on my hand like you're stepping
on the gas.

13:58.446 --> 14:01.732
That's good. Let's do the other foot.

14:03.785 --> 14:05.908
You do much driving, Darnel?

14:07.622 --> 14:08.998
Okay.

14:09.958 --> 14:13.659
Okay. Now I want you
to squeeze my hand.

14:13.879 --> 14:16.915
If you make me scream,
I'll give you a prize.

14:17.132 --> 14:20.418
- Give me a break.
- He speaks!

14:20.594 --> 14:24.758
Okay, come on. I wanna see
how the MD's affecting your body.

14:25.516 --> 14:29.596
Duchenne's muscular dystrophy
is a genetic disorder...

14:29.812 --> 14:33.395
...characterized by the wasting
of skeletal muscles.

14:34.066 --> 14:38.645
First you lose your legs,
then your arms, and then you die.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.437
That's how it's affecting my body.

14:47.956 --> 14:52.534
- Hold his head still.
- I'm sorry. He really hates hospitals.

14:52.752 --> 14:55.872
Don't be afraid.
We wanna make you better.

14:56.089 --> 14:59.921
He's good-natured,
considering what he's been through.

15:00.135 --> 15:01.962
What surgery has he had?

15:02.179 --> 15:05.844
A Nissen fundoplication
for gastroesophageal reflux.

15:06.058 --> 15:09.142
A hemicolectomy,
and a few laparotomies.

15:09.311 --> 15:11.434
- When was he vomiting?
- Today.

15:11.647 --> 15:13.474
Mucous membranes are moist.

15:13.649 --> 15:16.650
Did you feed him orally,
or in his G-tube?

15:16.819 --> 15:21.446
I gave him a little by mouth.
But not enough to induce this.

15:21.657 --> 15:25.323
I pray it's the flu.
But it may be a bowel obstruction.

15:25.661 --> 15:29.362
Abby, can you get this
foreign body ingestion?

15:29.582 --> 15:32.073
- Sure. Just a sec.
- Luka?

15:32.293 --> 15:34.500
Can I steal Abby? We're backed up.

15:34.712 --> 15:36.337
It's okay. Go ahead.

15:36.548 --> 15:38.873
So, what do you think it is?

15:39.259 --> 15:42.593
I'm not sure.
I'm gonna have to take some x-rays.

15:42.804 --> 15:48.143
Carol, can I get a weight
and a three-way abdominal series?

15:49.645 --> 15:52.017
- You dehydrated?
- How'd you guess?

15:52.189 --> 15:55.688
Jeremy Barnes. Abdominal cramping,
some diarrhea.

15:55.859 --> 15:58.351
A fever with a history
of a triple-A.

15:58.571 --> 16:01.655
- How are you feeling, sir?
- Lousy.

16:01.866 --> 16:05.531
- Any vomiting?
- No. I feel real nauseous.

16:05.745 --> 16:08.911
- When was your aneurysm repaired?
- A year ago.

16:09.123 --> 16:11.828
- Any complications?
- No complications.

16:12.043 --> 16:15.246
- I felt great until this.
- It's just the flu.

16:15.463 --> 16:17.871
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:21.469 --> 16:25.088
Maybe he's telling the truth.
School can get rough.

16:25.307 --> 16:27.679
He has skin-popping abscesses.

16:27.893 --> 16:31.428
- You get a tox screen?
- It's negative. He's clean.

16:31.647 --> 16:35.063
- You can't be sure.
- What are you thinking?

16:35.275 --> 16:38.976
I don't know.
But maybe you can bluff it out of him.

16:39.738 --> 16:42.276
- You okay?
- Somebody stole my patient.

16:42.491 --> 16:47.034
- Peter, did you steal Lucy's patient?
- Check the lost and found.

16:47.246 --> 16:48.906
Dr. Benton?

16:49.081 --> 16:50.540
- Hi.
- Mrs. Fulton.

16:50.750 --> 16:55.791
I took Tia to surgery. The nurse said
she can't have her operation today?

16:56.255 --> 16:59.256
I tried to call you.
Please, have a seat.

16:59.884 --> 17:04.131
- There's no availability in the O.R.
- Dr. Ashcoff change his mind?

17:04.347 --> 17:07.265
No, no, no.
We just have to reschedule.

17:07.767 --> 17:12.429
Well, we came all the way down here.
We can wait.

17:13.231 --> 17:16.316
- Tia hasn't eaten in eight hours-
- We can't...

17:16.568 --> 17:18.193
...do it today. I'm sorry.

17:20.821 --> 17:23.609
I'm not gonna get them fixed?

17:24.034 --> 17:27.237
You've waited long.
A few more days won't hurt.

17:27.997 --> 17:31.496
Hold on a minute, honey.
Can we...?

17:33.461 --> 17:37.245
It has taken me months
to get Tia out of the house.

17:37.465 --> 17:41.213
I can't give her false hope.
If this isn't gonna happen...

17:41.552 --> 17:43.130
...you need to tell us.

17:44.722 --> 17:48.672
It's gonna happen.
I just need a little time.

17:50.353 --> 17:51.384
Thanks.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.061
Mr. Barnes needs Compazine,
run saline through...

17:59.279 --> 18:01.521
...and check his electrolytes.

18:01.990 --> 18:04.362
Can't you get a nurse to do that?

18:04.576 --> 18:07.067
- You used to be one.
- I'm not now.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.161
You're here to learn.

18:09.373 --> 18:14.616
This is an opportunity to learn how to
check his stool for fecal leukocytes.

18:14.837 --> 18:16.461
Thanks.

18:18.549 --> 18:20.506
- What's his pulse ox?
-82.

18:20.718 --> 18:23.553
- And how much oxygen is he on?
-10 liters.

18:26.182 --> 18:29.266
The flu is making it difficult
to breathe.

18:32.480 --> 18:35.647
It ain't just the flu.

18:37.026 --> 18:40.360
No. You also have
congestive heart failure.

18:40.530 --> 18:42.902
A tube will help you breathe.

18:43.366 --> 18:46.071
No. Thank you.

18:47.704 --> 18:52.082
- Do you have someone we can call?
- No.

18:52.292 --> 18:56.586
All my friends is homeless.
No phones.

18:57.464 --> 19:00.252
- Any family?
- No.

19:01.719 --> 19:05.966
Okay. I really think you need
to go on a ventilator.

19:06.182 --> 19:09.551
No. Thank you.

19:11.354 --> 19:15.897
I always hoped I might die
in a warm bed...

19:16.567 --> 19:21.360
...with clean sheets,
if it's all the same to you.

19:27.913 --> 19:30.748
X- rays show nonspecific
bowel gas pattern.

19:30.957 --> 19:33.531
- So, it's not another adhesion?
- Right.

19:33.752 --> 19:38.129
Blood gas is back. PH is 7.38.
PCO-2 is 30.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.582
Is it respiratory alkalosis?

19:40.801 --> 19:44.252
Partly. But also an acidosis.
It's complicated.

19:44.430 --> 19:48.759
- Are you a nurse?
- No. I've read every book on chalazia.

19:48.934 --> 19:51.935
- Did they do an upper GI?
- Six months ago.

19:52.146 --> 19:57.104
They thought he had a gastric outlet
blockage. You're not gonna do that?

19:57.318 --> 20:00.272
- It'll rule out an obstruction.
- No, please.

20:00.488 --> 20:04.616
They put an NG tube up his nose.
He wouldn't stop crying.

20:04.826 --> 20:07.115
I know he's been through a lot.

20:07.287 --> 20:11.498
He has a metabolic disorder.
We have to find out why he's sick.

20:11.833 --> 20:15.249
I will be as gentle as possible.
Okay?

20:15.462 --> 20:16.956
Okay.

20:17.255 --> 20:18.798
I'll be back.

20:23.262 --> 20:26.132
- What?
- You tell me.

20:27.266 --> 20:28.808
Nothing.

20:29.351 --> 20:31.640
We tested your blood, Marty.

20:32.104 --> 20:33.978
Yeah? So?

20:34.148 --> 20:37.980
- Where do you get the dirty needles?
- What do you mean?

20:38.277 --> 20:39.985
Marty, I know.

20:43.366 --> 20:46.817
You can't tell my dad. Please.
He won't understand.

20:47.036 --> 20:50.156
You can't use dirty needles.
You're infected...

20:50.373 --> 20:52.864
...and if you share,
you could get HIV.

20:53.084 --> 20:57.663
Don't worry. I stole them from my
grandmother. She's got diabetes.

20:57.839 --> 21:01.754
- Why do you do it?
- Kids with crooked teeth get braces.

21:01.968 --> 21:07.211
My mom got laser surgery on her eyes.
Why can't I use hormones?

21:07.474 --> 21:10.428
- For what?
- To grow taller.

21:12.020 --> 21:16.848
You're injecting human growth hormone?
Where do you get it?

21:17.067 --> 21:21.528
- It's not illegal.
- Where do you get it, Marty?

21:24.033 --> 21:27.817
- Off the Internet.
- Then you don't know what's in it.

21:28.037 --> 21:31.453
Do you know the health risks
you've been exposed to?

21:31.666 --> 21:34.204
It can't be worse than being beat up.

21:34.419 --> 21:38.547
Even that stupid kid
in the wheelchair picks on me.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.796
If you can get me the real stuff, I-

21:42.010 --> 21:46.589
Hormone therapy is not
for healthy adolescents.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.681
Well, I'm not healthy.

21:48.892 --> 21:52.937
I go to school every day knowing
that I'm gonna be beat up...

21:53.146 --> 21:58.141
...or shoved into a locker,
or dragged into the girls' shower room.

21:58.736 --> 22:03.481
Do you know how embarrassing it is
to be stuffed inside a trash can...

22:03.699 --> 22:06.819
...while the whole cafeteria's
laughing at you?

22:09.538 --> 22:12.076
Hormones aren't going to help that.

22:12.500 --> 22:16.249
Yeah? Well, being bigger will.

22:23.928 --> 22:25.636
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:28.433 --> 22:30.924
- You okay?
- Yeah.

22:31.102 --> 22:33.890
- Have you seen the Cetacaine?
- No.

22:34.106 --> 22:37.605
- We always keep it on this counter.
- Sorry.

22:38.151 --> 22:41.900
Carol? Are you uncomfortable
with my being here?

22:42.448 --> 22:43.527
Why would I be?

22:44.158 --> 22:49.069
It's hard for nurses when nurses go
to med school. I switched teams.

22:49.371 --> 22:50.570
I'm gonna be sick.

22:50.790 --> 22:53.993
Actually, I almost went
to med school myself.

22:54.502 --> 22:57.289
- Is it something else?
- It's just stupid.

22:58.089 --> 22:59.120
Oh, my God!

22:59.340 --> 23:03.124
- Have you had an ulcer?
- What's wrong with him?

23:03.344 --> 23:05.752
I don't know. I'll get a doctor.

23:05.972 --> 23:08.641
- I need a Yankauer.
- Top drawer.

23:09.142 --> 23:10.173
Peter!

23:14.272 --> 23:17.226
I'm gonna start a line.
Check his BP.

23:17.818 --> 23:20.605
He just started vomiting
bright red blood.

23:20.821 --> 23:23.656
- What's the history?
- Looks like triple-A.

23:23.865 --> 23:25.443
- Ulcer, I think.
- Think?

23:25.659 --> 23:29.075
- He's not my patient.
- Okay, here we go.

23:29.288 --> 23:32.871
Set me up for a central line.
Squeeze in two liters.

23:33.083 --> 23:35.753
Get me four units O-neg.

23:35.961 --> 23:38.417
- What's wrong?
- Bleeding through his GI.

23:38.631 --> 23:40.505
- Call the O.R.
- What happened?

23:40.675 --> 23:43.629
- Aorto-enteric fistula.
- Should we take him?

23:43.845 --> 23:46.051
- Just tube him.
-80 ET.

23:46.264 --> 23:47.675
- Damn it!
- Now!

23:47.849 --> 23:50.885
- Why is he here?
- Corday said it was the flu.

23:51.102 --> 23:55.598
- His pulse is weak. BP's 50 palp.
- We need to stop the bleeding.

23:55.815 --> 23:57.393
- What's your name?
- Abby.

23:57.609 --> 24:00.563
- Can you sew this?
- Yes. A suture?

24:00.779 --> 24:03.352
As long as it doesn't pull away.

24:03.532 --> 24:06.533
- Prep him for a lap.
- You can't do one here-

24:06.743 --> 24:08.653
No choice. Scalpel!

24:08.870 --> 24:14.209
I'll make a small midline incision,
and clamp below the diaphragm.

24:14.710 --> 24:16.038
- Got that?
- Almost.

24:16.211 --> 24:18.169
All right. Let's go.

24:21.884 --> 24:24.553
- Pressure's at 90.
- This should hold him.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.049
Tell the O.R. we're coming.

24:26.222 --> 24:30.136
- Two units of O-neg in.
- Operating in the ER, Peter?

24:30.351 --> 24:34.016
- He had an aortal-enteric fistula.
- Why isn't he in surgery?

24:34.230 --> 24:37.564
- He had flu symptoms.
- Look like the flu, Malatucci?

24:37.734 --> 24:42.396
- Malucci. No. But Dr. Benton-
- Save it for the disciplinary hearing.

24:42.614 --> 24:46.825
Let's get him to O.R. before you
use the rest of our blood supply.

24:47.828 --> 24:50.745
You got to admit,
that was pretty cool.

24:57.379 --> 25:00.629
- Can I go home now?
- Not just yet.

25:00.841 --> 25:04.008
- I want you to try something first.
- What?

25:04.428 --> 25:07.513
- Computer.
- I've seen one or two.

25:07.723 --> 25:12.765
Maybe the MD's affecting your motor
skills and causing trouble at school.

25:12.979 --> 25:16.597
- Wrong.
- You can keep up with other kids.

25:16.941 --> 25:19.230
The school is full of losers.

25:19.736 --> 25:22.653
Oh, well.
Come on, just give it a try.

25:25.533 --> 25:27.241
Oops!

25:27.786 --> 25:29.909
- Feel better?
- A little.

25:30.121 --> 25:33.573
- Want to smash something else?
- Maybe.

25:38.088 --> 25:40.164
Is that the best you can do?

25:50.518 --> 25:51.846
Here.

25:52.853 --> 25:53.968
Yeah, that's it.

25:54.855 --> 25:56.314
That's it.

26:03.197 --> 26:05.356
Let me see you write your name.

26:12.373 --> 26:15.375
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to help.

26:17.462 --> 26:21.709
I'm tired of people trying
to help me all the time.

26:22.259 --> 26:24.928
People try to help too much sometimes?

26:28.807 --> 26:33.683
I don't need to be pushed around.
I don't need to have my food cut.

26:34.647 --> 26:38.775
I don't need my mom to give me
a freaking bath all the time.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.277
I'm not a baby.

26:46.117 --> 26:51.456
No, you're not.
I'm gonna go talk to your mother.

26:51.664 --> 26:55.033
- Why don't you clean this up?
- Me?

26:55.251 --> 26:58.667
You helped me make the mess.
You help me clean it.

26:58.838 --> 27:00.001
Okay.

27:04.928 --> 27:07.763
- It's okay, honey.
- There. No more.

27:07.973 --> 27:11.140
- Luka, I need to talk to you.
- Hold on.

27:11.351 --> 27:12.894
It'll take a second.

27:13.103 --> 27:17.516
Okay. I'll be right back.
Good boy. Good boy.

27:17.691 --> 27:19.518
Yeah. Good boy, honey.

27:22.196 --> 27:24.983
I tried contacting his pediatrician.

27:25.199 --> 27:29.861
He doesn't have one, which seemed
weird to me for a kid this sick.

27:30.079 --> 27:35.037
I called Northwestern, Rush, Mercy.
He's been admitted to all three ERs.

27:35.251 --> 27:39.712
- Several times, multiple admissions.
- I know. I've seen the scars.

27:40.089 --> 27:43.256
He needed surgery once
for his fundoplication.

27:43.468 --> 27:46.303
All the rest
were exploratory procedures.

27:46.554 --> 27:50.884
He has a metabolic disorder
and is at high risk for obstruction.

27:51.059 --> 27:53.930
Nobody has documented anything.

27:54.146 --> 27:56.981
I know.
But something's making him sick.

27:57.190 --> 28:00.310
- You thought about the mother?
- What about her?

28:00.861 --> 28:03.696
Maybe she's inducing his symptoms.

28:03.906 --> 28:07.156
She wants to find out
what's wrong with him.

28:07.451 --> 28:11.496
- Maybe she likes the attention.
- She'd hurt her child?

28:11.831 --> 28:15.330
- I've seen parents do it before.
- Okay. How?

28:15.543 --> 28:18.994
- I don't know.
- You can't say this without proof.

28:19.255 --> 28:22.754
What if his upper GI is negative?
CT shows nothing?

28:22.967 --> 28:25.589
Are you gonna admit him for surgery?

28:26.137 --> 28:30.087
I just started the work-up.
Let me figure it out.

28:30.558 --> 28:33.643
- Would you just consider it?
- Yeah.

28:33.853 --> 28:35.645
Okay.

28:36.648 --> 28:39.982
- He's fine.
- He's being abused by his classmates.

28:40.193 --> 28:42.482
- He has to fight back.
- That's not a solution.

28:42.696 --> 28:46.279
Look, Dr. Finch, my son's short.
So what?

28:46.492 --> 28:49.161
I'm short. And, yeah, I got picked on.

28:49.370 --> 28:51.030
I dealt with it. So will he.

28:51.247 --> 28:53.951
By injecting himself
with God knows what?

28:54.166 --> 28:57.001
That won't happen again.
I can assure you.

28:57.211 --> 29:00.082
Dr. Finch, Marty spiked
a fever of 103.

29:00.298 --> 29:02.670
- How are you feeling?
- Crummy.

29:02.884 --> 29:05.291
What do you expect?

29:05.511 --> 29:08.715
- Have you had a fever recently?
- He had the flu.

29:08.932 --> 29:11.090
There's a pansystolic murmur.

29:11.309 --> 29:13.467
- What?
- Has he had a heart murmur?

29:13.686 --> 29:16.356
- No.
- He's got splinter hemorrhages.

29:16.564 --> 29:19.056
- What's going on?
- Get blood cultures...

29:19.276 --> 29:20.556
...pentox and gent.

29:20.777 --> 29:24.692
- Order a cardiac echo.
- Something's wrong with my heart?

29:24.906 --> 29:28.489
The needle may have put bacteria
into your blood...

29:28.702 --> 29:31.240
...causing an infection
of your heart.

29:32.331 --> 29:35.248
Mr. Spencer? I'm Abby Lockheart.

29:35.459 --> 29:38.246
- I need a private room.
- We don't have any.

29:38.462 --> 29:42.246
With this flu epidemic,
this place is a big petri dish.

29:42.466 --> 29:46.678
- Take a deep breath?
- What if somebody comes in with TB?

29:46.888 --> 29:49.639
- What's the problem?
- My pulse is thready.

29:49.849 --> 29:54.061
- Really?
- My chest feels tight. I'm fatigued.

29:54.270 --> 29:57.604
My head's pounding
and I can barely hear anything.

29:57.816 --> 30:01.185
- Do your stools glow in the dark?
- What?

30:01.361 --> 30:04.196
- Your ears are full of wax.
- Oh, man!

30:04.406 --> 30:08.190
You can get that
from food additives or toxins.

30:08.368 --> 30:10.444
- I can clean them out.
- How?

30:10.662 --> 30:14.660
- I never put anything in my ears.
- We use a drill.

30:14.875 --> 30:18.624
- A drill?
- I'm kidding. I use peroxide.

30:19.630 --> 30:24.969
- Mrs. Brant? Radiology is ready.
- Okay. Okay. Here we go, sweetie.

30:25.177 --> 30:29.720
- I think I need an EKG.
- Carol, where's the EKG machine?

30:29.932 --> 30:32.221
Try Trauma.
Need me to draw labs?

30:32.393 --> 30:33.674
No. I got it.

30:33.895 --> 30:36.849
- We can wheel him out.
- I'd rather carry him.

30:37.065 --> 30:38.891
Okay. Sure.

30:39.108 --> 30:41.231
I'm still on shift downstairs.

30:41.402 --> 30:45.400
Should've considered that
before turning the ER into O.R.

30:45.615 --> 30:48.818
- I'm not doing-
- It won't kill you to observe!

30:49.035 --> 30:52.736
You still need to learn.
Somebody turn down the heat!

30:52.956 --> 30:55.661
- It's 68 degrees.
- Maybe it's the flu.

30:55.876 --> 30:58.248
- I don't get sick.
- Is it the change?

31:00.088 --> 31:02.626
- DeBakey clamp.
- I can finish up.

31:02.841 --> 31:05.759
I would like you to shut up...

31:05.970 --> 31:08.757
...while I save this man's life.
Suction.

31:10.266 --> 31:12.139
What did you find?

31:12.351 --> 31:16.681
- The study was negative.
- So, what do we do now?

31:16.897 --> 31:20.598
- We should do a CT scan.
- What about endoscopy?

31:22.987 --> 31:28.029
I don't want to put your son through
an unnecessary invasive procedure.

31:28.243 --> 31:32.157
I feel we're wasting time.
Shouldn't a surgeon see him?

31:33.123 --> 31:35.032
After the scan.

31:43.717 --> 31:48.130
- Sat's down to 78.
- Put him on 100% nonrebreather mask.

31:48.430 --> 31:52.475
Anything else I can do
to make you more comfortable?

31:53.644 --> 31:55.969
My lunch box.

32:01.027 --> 32:02.437
This?

32:05.698 --> 32:10.076
There's $118 in there.

32:10.745 --> 32:15.241
- Give it to my friends.
- Do you want it to go to a shelter?

32:17.252 --> 32:20.585
No. Just throw it off the roof.

32:21.464 --> 32:25.758
- Throw the money off the roof?
- Yeah. They'll find it.

32:30.098 --> 32:34.227
- Conner's GI series was negative.
- You seem surprised.

32:34.436 --> 32:37.852
I was hoping
to find something wrong with him.

32:38.065 --> 32:42.727
She wants an endoscopy. She was
disappointed when I wanted to wait.

32:42.945 --> 32:45.519
And I think you might be right.

32:46.866 --> 32:50.116
- Is this gonna hurt?
- No. It's just peroxide.

32:50.328 --> 32:53.412
- You might feel a few bubbles.
- Bubbles?

32:53.623 --> 32:58.201
- What if they get into my blood?
- That won't happen. I'll be back.

32:58.378 --> 33:00.869
- What about my chest?
- EKG was normal.

33:01.047 --> 33:04.250
Maybe I should have a stress echo.

33:04.467 --> 33:05.926
That's not necessary.

33:06.136 --> 33:09.339
What is the sense
of sophisticated technology...

33:09.556 --> 33:13.221
...if you die before you
get a chance to use it? Hey!

33:14.019 --> 33:16.937
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

33:17.314 --> 33:21.561
- How's he doing?
- Well, not so good.

33:21.735 --> 33:25.021
Lots of tests
and they don't know what's wrong.

33:25.239 --> 33:29.735
- I'm sure Dr. Kovac is being-
- Did he call for a surgical consult?

33:29.952 --> 33:32.657
- I don't know. I could check.
- Would you?

33:32.872 --> 33:34.070
Sure.

33:37.668 --> 33:41.916
Another 30 Prolene.
Get that rake out of my way, please.

33:42.090 --> 33:43.632
Oh, man!

33:43.841 --> 33:45.585
- Sure you're okay?
- Yes.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.595
You're over-sewing
the duodenal defect.

33:48.805 --> 33:53.266
There's no substitute for precision.
Lizzie, joining the party?

33:53.435 --> 33:56.970
- Mr. Barnes eroded his aortic graft.
- Is he a friend?

33:57.189 --> 34:00.225
I thought he had gastroenteritis.

34:00.442 --> 34:02.233
Peter didn't mention that.

34:02.444 --> 34:06.738
How valiant of you to not
rat Lizzie out on her gross oversight.

34:06.949 --> 34:11.112
- How's he doing?
- Fine. Now that he's been diagnosed.

34:11.536 --> 34:13.364
Lizzie, scrub in.

34:13.873 --> 34:16.114
- I'm off.
- You're not anymore.

34:16.792 --> 34:20.458
I'm gonna dissect the small bowel
off the aorta now.

34:20.630 --> 34:23.547
- You should use a Metz.
- I'd quit while-

34:23.757 --> 34:25.715
- Damn it!
- Robert?

34:25.927 --> 34:27.670
I'm fine...

34:28.513 --> 34:30.090
Robert?

34:30.639 --> 34:31.755
He's burning up!

34:31.975 --> 34:33.931
Let's get Metz and pick-up.

34:34.143 --> 34:36.849
Get a gurney!
He's got a weak pulse!

34:37.063 --> 34:40.728
Suction. 30 Prolene. Let's get ready.

34:48.699 --> 34:50.907
Not afraid you'll catch cold?

34:51.120 --> 34:54.405
No. They're not stacking up again,
are they?

34:54.623 --> 34:58.491
It's over. Figure out
what was wrong with that kid?

34:58.669 --> 35:02.667
Got tired of being short.
Injected himself with hormones.

35:02.882 --> 35:06.880
- Why didn't I think of that?
- Vegetations on his valve.

35:07.094 --> 35:08.589
Endocarditis?

35:08.805 --> 35:11.212
He used Grandma's insulin needles.

35:11.432 --> 35:15.513
- What did Cardiology say?
- They put him on antibiotics.

35:15.812 --> 35:18.896
Hopefully, he won't need surgery.

35:19.524 --> 35:22.691
- All of that for a couple of inches.
- Yep.

35:23.778 --> 35:27.693
- You're releasing too early.
- Why don't you show me?

35:27.866 --> 35:31.069
- You don't want any of this.
- I don't?

35:31.912 --> 35:34.747
Okay. Show me what you got.

35:39.086 --> 35:41.957
- What is it?
- His stomach is distended!

35:42.172 --> 35:45.873
- Get me a syringe.
- I told you to call a surgeon!

35:46.093 --> 35:49.297
- What? What are you doing?
- Hold on.

35:50.264 --> 35:52.221
What's that? Is he bleeding?

35:52.391 --> 35:56.639
No. Indicator mixed with saline.
Turns red in the stomach acid.

35:56.854 --> 35:58.847
What are you talking about?

35:59.566 --> 36:04.904
That's not mine. That belongs to the
doctor or nurse, she left it here.

36:05.238 --> 36:09.568
Actually, we had her leave it.
It's not peroxide. It's saline.

36:09.784 --> 36:12.240
- What are you talking about?
- You know.

36:12.454 --> 36:15.075
You've been poisoning him.
Security-

36:15.290 --> 36:19.158
Stop! I didn't give you permission.
We are leaving!

36:19.461 --> 36:21.121
I'm afraid you are not.

36:21.338 --> 36:22.998
I can't allow this.

36:24.049 --> 36:27.584
I love Conner. I would never hurt him.

36:28.470 --> 36:30.843
Mrs. Brant, you need help.

36:34.060 --> 36:35.886
Sweetie, it's okay.

36:36.103 --> 36:37.977
It's okay, sweetie.

36:38.648 --> 36:42.598
They're not gonna hurt you.
Mommy has you.

36:42.777 --> 36:47.024
Mommy has you. It's okay.

36:47.407 --> 36:50.906
Call Transport.
Mr. Clayton has to go to the morgue.

36:51.119 --> 36:55.947
- That old guy died? From the flu?
- Put him into respiratory failure.

36:56.124 --> 36:58.449
I should've gotten that flu shot.

37:00.796 --> 37:03.916
- Someone give you a tip?
- He had a daughter.

37:04.132 --> 37:07.003
- Who?
- He told me he had no family.

37:07.219 --> 37:10.635
- You're the executor of his estate?
- Yeah.

37:11.348 --> 37:12.759
- Hey, Abby.
- Hey.

37:12.975 --> 37:16.593
Residents have to take students out
for a drink.

37:16.812 --> 37:20.016
- Thought you were sick.
- You could nurse me...

37:20.232 --> 37:24.147
Whoa! Wow! You look-

37:24.362 --> 37:26.651
Wow! You know-

37:26.823 --> 37:30.108
- Did you have a hot date?
- Maybe.

37:32.245 --> 37:34.950
- You're drooling on my chart.
- Sorry.

37:35.165 --> 37:38.700
So, yeah. How about that drink?

37:38.919 --> 37:40.496
You're kidding, right?

37:46.051 --> 37:49.171
- How's he doing?
- He has a kidney stone.

37:49.388 --> 37:53.516
- You're kidding.
- Not big enough. He won't need surgery.

37:53.684 --> 37:56.009
That can't be a lot of fun.

37:56.228 --> 37:59.431
Thanks for covering for me.
I appreciate it.

37:59.857 --> 38:03.558
- Anybody could've missed it.
- My mind was elsewhere.

38:05.529 --> 38:09.195
- So, you're going in to gloat?
- Oh, yeah.

38:10.952 --> 38:13.110
I wouldn't take glee in this.

38:13.329 --> 38:17.541
I just came to tell you
that Mr. Barnes is stable in Recovery.

38:17.750 --> 38:19.873
Good thing I was observing.

38:20.086 --> 38:22.708
This means I owe you something.

38:22.922 --> 38:27.335
- I'll settle for a thank you.
- How very gracious. Thank you.

38:27.552 --> 38:30.719
And the O.R. time
for the girl's surgery.

38:30.931 --> 38:34.216
You finished and closed for me.
Big deal.

38:34.393 --> 38:36.848
How can you be against this?

38:37.062 --> 38:39.304
This is my job.

38:40.941 --> 38:44.986
If I do favors for you,
I have to do them for everybody.

38:46.238 --> 38:50.022
Which is why we never
had this conversation.

38:53.704 --> 38:58.082
- That means I can have the O.R.?
- I don't want to know about it.

38:59.335 --> 39:03.997
- Good luck with that. Thank you.
- You're welcome, Peter.

39:06.634 --> 39:09.172
Abby, thanks for helping back there.

39:09.387 --> 39:12.756
- She poured it down his G-tube?
- Yeah.

39:12.933 --> 39:15.803
- Ever part of a sting operation?
- No.

39:16.019 --> 39:17.727
Welcome to the ER.

39:17.938 --> 39:19.598
Is Spencer your patient?

39:19.815 --> 39:22.567
- Yeah.
- He's having a heart attack.

39:22.734 --> 39:23.766
What?

39:23.944 --> 39:25.984
Start him on dopamine.

39:26.196 --> 39:28.569
- What happened?
- He your patient?

39:28.782 --> 39:31.108
- Did you give him medication?
- No.

39:31.285 --> 39:32.945
BP, 70 palp.

39:33.162 --> 39:36.578
- He complain of chest pains?
- His EKG was normal.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.911
Not anymore. He's having an acute Ml.

39:40.127 --> 39:41.954
No cardiac risk factor.

39:42.171 --> 39:47.166
- HemoCue is six.
- He needs nitroglycerin and a drip.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.137
- I'll start a second line.
- V-tach.

39:50.346 --> 39:53.798
- Charge to 100.
- Synch cardioversion.

39:54.476 --> 39:57.761
Chuny can get that. Take those.
He's your patient.

39:58.939 --> 40:00.314
Clear.

40:05.028 --> 40:07.436
- Elizabeth.
- Hello, Mother.

40:07.656 --> 40:10.990
- What are you doing here?
- I live here, remember?

40:11.201 --> 40:15.151
Yes. I meant to call you.
I just got in last week.

40:15.372 --> 40:19.204
- Elizabeth, save me the pouty face.
- I'm not pouting.

40:19.418 --> 40:22.503
I can't believe you didn't call me.

40:22.713 --> 40:26.711
Yes. Well, I'm here now.
And freezing.

40:26.926 --> 40:30.971
If we're gonna talk,
could we find somewhere warm?

40:31.180 --> 40:36.341
Preferably where they serve alcohol.
Or have the Americans banned that?

40:36.728 --> 40:39.599
Anyone ever tell you
white men can't jump?

40:39.814 --> 40:42.352
- That was a foul.
- You tripped.

40:42.567 --> 40:44.690
- You hip-checked me.
- Dr. Greene?

40:45.487 --> 40:48.192
- What?
- You said call if I had trouble.

40:48.365 --> 40:49.989
Yeah.

40:50.367 --> 40:52.692
Well...

40:55.330 --> 40:58.415
He's a hypochondriac.
His tests were normal.

40:58.626 --> 41:03.169
Mls don't always present symptoms.
You didn't get a blood count.

41:03.380 --> 41:08.588
White count was 1800.
Crit was only 18. What does that mean?

41:08.803 --> 41:10.511
- Aplastic anemia.
- Bingo.

41:10.721 --> 41:13.841
Decreased oxygen-carrying capacity
is a risk.

41:14.058 --> 41:18.851
Hematology is gonna want
to do a bone marrow biopsy.

41:19.063 --> 41:20.973
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

41:21.191 --> 41:23.563
I should've protected you more.

41:23.777 --> 41:28.071
You gotta think like a doctor.
You don't have to do it all.

41:28.281 --> 41:33.524
Make sure the nurses order your labs.
They have a standing order on CBCs.

41:33.745 --> 41:35.537
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

41:38.667 --> 41:43.210
I don't know how you keep your
complexion here. Nothing but wind.

41:43.422 --> 41:46.506
- I don't work in construction.
- That's right.

41:46.717 --> 41:51.379
You cut people up like your father.
How is Charles?

41:51.597 --> 41:55.642
Happy. We had a lovely time
when he was in town last.

41:55.852 --> 41:59.766
- You know, Daddy stays at my place.
- How delightful!

42:00.440 --> 42:04.140
- Would you like to stay with me?
- Whatever for?

42:05.195 --> 42:09.442
I have a spare room and I haven't
seen you in three years.

42:09.616 --> 42:13.827
- That's not my fault.
- I'd like you to come and stay.

42:15.747 --> 42:20.208
- All right. I agree.
- I'm honored.

42:21.920 --> 42:26.463
- You look well. You must have a man.
- Do I need a man to look well?

42:27.301 --> 42:31.299
It helps. So, have you?

42:31.639 --> 42:34.343
- Yes.
- I suppose he is a doctor.

42:35.017 --> 42:40.308
Actually, yes. His name is Mark.
And he is lovely.

42:43.067 --> 42:45.143
Come on, chicken!

42:45.361 --> 42:48.315
- We never finished.
- You were down by eight.

42:48.489 --> 42:50.981
- I was pacing myself.
- Good night.

42:51.201 --> 42:52.611
Quitter.

42:53.703 --> 42:55.910
All right. Bring it on.

43:03.088 --> 43:06.504
Good night, Mark. Nice hat.

43:09.845 --> 43:11.968
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:12.181 --> 43:15.217
- You're the new med student?
- Abby Lockheart.

43:15.434 --> 43:17.142
- Lucy.
- Nice to meet you.

43:17.353 --> 43:22.692
- How was your first day?
- I haven't had one of these in years.

43:23.109 --> 43:26.809
- What happened?
- It's more like what didn't happen?

43:27.154 --> 43:32.493
I used to work in OB.
Up there, I would deliver a baby...

43:32.702 --> 43:36.036
...and I would deliver a baby.

43:36.206 --> 43:39.788
And today, I was puked on,
spit at, bit...

43:40.794 --> 43:43.914
And then I tricked a psychotic woman.

43:44.130 --> 43:48.709
- And then I almost killed a guy.
- That sounds about right.

43:48.885 --> 43:52.005
Fortunately, in the ER,
"almost" doesn't count.

43:54.600 --> 43:57.601
- What are you doing?
- Patient's last request.

43:58.103 --> 44:00.725
Toss some. You might feel better.

44:01.732 --> 44:04.677
- Do you have to say a prayer?
- I don't think so.
