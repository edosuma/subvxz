01:21.381 --> 01:23.440
Wow, golf on a Wednesday,
huh, Ari?

01:23.483 --> 01:25.314
In the next life I want
to come back as you.

01:25.351 --> 01:26.943
Wish I could return
the compliment, E,

01:26.986 --> 01:29.216
but I'd rather come back as
one of Michael Vick's dogs.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.655
Awesome.
So how's this golf game

01:31.691 --> 01:33.784
gonna get Vince in this movie
anyway, just so I'm clear?

01:33.827 --> 01:36.625
Alan is a degenerate
gambler and he's awful.

01:36.663 --> 01:38.187
I used to take him
for many dollars.

01:38.231 --> 01:40.131
Today I am going to
let him win.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.691
And then when he feels cocky
I'm gonna seize the moment.

01:42.735 --> 01:44.635
So you're gonna bet
Vince into the movie?

01:44.671 --> 01:47.367
- Yup.
- I'm feeling real confident now, Ari.

01:47.407 --> 01:50.808
Your physical appearance has left you
no reason to ever feel confident.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.039
But sometimes
you appear to be.

01:53.079 --> 01:55.639
Appear to be that way
for Vince today and who knows,

01:55.682 --> 01:59.015
maybe Uncle Ari will deliver
a present by day's end.

01:59.052 --> 02:01.077
- Good luck, Ari.
- Suck it, E.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.285
I got a 9:30
call time.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.451
You care if I roll
with Drama, Vin?

02:06.493 --> 02:08.085
I just want you
to be happy, Turtle.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.255
- Appreciate that.
- How those want ads looking, Turtle?

02:10.295 --> 02:11.888
Depressing.

02:11.931 --> 02:15.025
You guys think I could sell myself
to old broads for cash?

02:15.068 --> 02:16.365
Yeah, if they have
vision problems.

02:16.402 --> 02:18.233
Turtle, you really don't
have to get a job.

02:18.271 --> 02:19.704
Uh, yeah, Vin,
I really do.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.104
I need a little cash
in my pocket.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.041
You got your face to land pussy.
What do I got?

02:23.076 --> 02:25.306
- A point.
- I got some cash I can give you.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.905
No way. I'm not taking anything
from you when you're hurting.

02:27.947 --> 02:29.608
Turtle, I appreciate it,
but I'm not hurting that bad.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.310
Uh, yeah, Vince,
you are.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.512
It's just temporary.
We all know you're gonna bounce back.

02:33.553 --> 02:36.147
Well, let's find you
a job then.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.681
You have any ideas yet?

02:38.725 --> 02:40.920
Really just one
and it ain't in there.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.291
What is it?

02:42.328 --> 02:45.491
You know Drama's been looking
to hire an assistant.

02:45.532 --> 02:48.126
Since I go to work with the guy
half the time anyway...

02:48.168 --> 02:49.601
What do you think?

02:49.636 --> 02:51.467
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

02:51.504 --> 02:52.801
Why not keep it
in the family?

02:52.839 --> 02:54.238
Could you bring it
up to him?

02:54.274 --> 02:56.299
'Cause I know if I do he's gonna
give me a hard time.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.435
- Sure.
- You ready to go?

02:58.478 --> 03:00.708
- Yeah.
- Hey, Johnny.

03:00.747 --> 03:01.873
Hey, bro.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.815
How about hiring Turtle
as your assistant?

03:06.052 --> 03:09.385
- I don't think so.
- Come on, Drama. It's only temporary.

03:09.422 --> 03:11.549
- No way.
- Why not?

03:11.591 --> 03:14.651
Because what I'm looking
for in an assistant you don't have.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.219
- And what's that?
- An ass I'd want to fuck.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.424
Oh please.
You haven't hired an assistant

03:19.465 --> 03:21.296
'cause you haven't found an ass
cheap enough to work for you yet.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.302
What's the going rate
for assistants nowadays?

03:23.336 --> 03:25.861
Well, other cast members
are paying around 700.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.338
But I won't go over 250.

03:27.373 --> 03:30.171
- Make it 300 cash and he's in.
- 300?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.973
I'll get the rest back
to you when I get a job.

03:32.011 --> 03:34.241
- Sounds good.
- Not to me it don't.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.611
Come on.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.548
Bro, he's never gonna
be able to handle the job.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.576
Please. I handle working for Vince,
I can handle working for you.

03:40.620 --> 03:44.078
Working in fantasyland
don't qualify you to run Iraq.

03:44.123 --> 03:46.216
Whatever you need,
I will do, Drama.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.420
I think that means
if you really want, you can fuck him.

03:48.461 --> 03:50.258
Oh, you're just
on fire today.

03:50.296 --> 03:53.527
Come on, bro. There's no way
he's ever gonna listen to me.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.864
Turtle, do you promise to
listen to every word he says?

03:55.902 --> 03:57.961
Cross my heart
hope to die.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.869
Stick a needle
in your eye?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.739
And I'll take responsibility
for his performance.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.841
All right, I'll try him
out for the day.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.346
- Nice.
- Come on, Turtle, let's go.

04:08.381 --> 04:10.144
Do not disappoint me.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.515
Uh, can I get
an advance?

04:12.552 --> 04:13.917
No.

04:15.154 --> 04:16.587
So what are we
gonna do today?

04:16.623 --> 04:18.921
I have a pitch meeting
at the network with Charlie.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.188
Oh.
That's cool.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.029
You could come.

04:25.064 --> 04:27.055
- Nah.
- You sure?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.068
Yeah.

04:34.574 --> 04:37.042
- Hello?
- I didn't do anything wrong, Vin.

04:37.076 --> 04:39.010
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Dom?

04:39.045 --> 04:41.138
I'm really screwed, Vin.
I'm really screwed.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.613
What's going on?
What's wrong?

04:44.317 --> 04:46.285
Turn on the news.

04:47.887 --> 04:50.048
...involved in a high-speed
car chase...

04:50.089 --> 04:52.387
Holy shit.
Dom, is that you?

04:52.425 --> 04:54.393
Yeah, it's me.
And I don't know what to do.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.590
Well, pull the fuck over.
Yo, E, get out here.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.928
Jesus Christ,
I'm done, Vin.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.934
I'm done.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.368
- What's up?
- Dom.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.463
No fucking way!

05:06.506 --> 05:10.135
...this breaking story.
Oh, it appears...

05:10.176 --> 05:11.666
- Get out of the car.
- I'm coming.

05:11.711 --> 05:14.305
- Show me your hands.
- I'm peaceful.

05:14.347 --> 05:15.746
- I'm sorry, Vin. I love ya.
- Get out of the car.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.579
I'm sorry for anything
I ever did to you.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.244
Dom!

05:19.285 --> 05:21.617
I think you're gonna want
to cancel your meeting.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.622
...is slowly coming
out of the car.

05:29.362 --> 05:32.820
Well, looking
very nice, Ari.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.662
Glad to see you
still got your swing

05:34.701 --> 05:36.396
so I'm not gonna feel too bad
taking all your money.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.870
Only time you ever took my money is
when you fucked me on a deal, Alan.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.339
Well, my game's improved
immeasurably over the last 10 years.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.342
Today, I'm gonna fuck
you on the course.

05:43.376 --> 05:46.504
I look forward to that. Just like the old
days when we were nobodies.

05:46.546 --> 05:48.480
Hey, Alan.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.948
- How are you, Bob?
- How are you?

05:50.983 --> 05:52.541
Good to see you.
Everything good?

05:52.585 --> 05:54.780
Yeah, I was supposed to play
a round with Pete Bogdanovich.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.618
He had an emergency,
he didn't show up.

05:56.656 --> 05:59.625
So figured I'd just come and whack
a few balls before I go home.

05:59.659 --> 06:01.854
At your age, the fact that you
can whack anything is a miracle.

06:01.894 --> 06:05.057
Ha ha. Always too clever
for your own good, Ari.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.191
You're right
about that, Bob.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.170
Wait a minute.
You annoy Ari.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.069
- Why don't you join us?
- Alan.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.540
You can talk to me about that picture
you've been trying to get me to make.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.475
- What, the Ramones picture?
- Sure thing.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.842
- It's not dead?
- Nothing's ever dead in this town.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.712
You're living proof
of that, Bob.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.345
That's terrific news.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.320
Slide in,
I'll ride with you.

06:28.354 --> 06:30.049
Sorry, Bob.
You ride with Ari.

06:30.089 --> 06:31.886
I brought my pro today
to keep me in line.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.824
- You brought your pro, Alan?
- I sure did.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.760
In fact, here he is.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.456
Hey, partner.

06:37.497 --> 06:40.261
Is this whose ass
we're gonna kick today?

06:41.768 --> 06:43.133
Ari Gold.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.069
Phil Mickelson.

06:47.673 --> 06:50.073
The day starts
when I say it starts.

06:50.109 --> 06:51.599
The day ends
when I say it ends.

06:51.644 --> 06:53.407
Got you, boss.

06:53.446 --> 06:55.437
No weed smoking,
no boozing.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.415
Hey, Drama.
Turtle.

06:57.450 --> 06:58.917
What's up, Jimmy?
How are you?

06:58.951 --> 07:00.942
- And no cavorting.
- I was just being polite.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.386
Well, don't be.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.049
The real reason I haven't
hired an assistant

07:04.090 --> 07:06.490
is because I haven't found anyone
who could match my intensity,

07:06.526 --> 07:08.187
especially while
I'm creating.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.457
I will match it.
Here you go.

07:10.496 --> 07:11.895
We'll see.

07:13.666 --> 07:16.328
I'm gonna need you to get me breakfast
while I look at my sides.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.030
Okay, no problem.
What do you want?

07:18.070 --> 07:19.867
FiberCon raisin.

07:19.906 --> 07:21.373
- Done.
- Wait.

07:21.407 --> 07:24.433
That's FiberCon cereal
with raisins added.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.206
Gotcha.

07:26.245 --> 07:29.806
But I want the raisons added
from the Raisin Bran box.

07:29.849 --> 07:31.407
I don't understand.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.817
Pour a bowl of FiberCon,

07:33.853 --> 07:35.411
open up a box
of Raisin Bran,

07:35.455 --> 07:37.787
grab 20 or 30 raisins
out of it.

07:37.824 --> 07:41.385
Also I need half-orange-juice-
half-apple-juice

07:41.427 --> 07:43.827
in a coffee mug
with a splash of V8.

07:43.863 --> 07:45.490
And paper-thin
banana slices,

07:45.531 --> 07:46.930
about an eighth
of an inch thick.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.934
How am I supposed to know
if they're an eighth of an inch?

07:48.968 --> 07:50.902
You should be able
to see through them.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.427
You're fucking
with me, right?

07:52.472 --> 07:53.996
You gonna question
everything I ask today?

07:54.040 --> 07:56.167
- No no.
- 'Cause I'll tell Vince.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.733
No, you don't have to tell
Vince anything.

07:57.777 --> 08:00.712
Don't make me.
Now go, on the hop.

08:00.746 --> 08:03.909
You know how angry I get
when my blood sugar drops.

08:06.886 --> 08:09.616
Charlie, listen, you're gonna have to call
a cab and meet me there.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.520
I can't believe you're
doing this to me again.

08:11.557 --> 08:13.684
You know I wanted to go over
the pitch before, right?

08:13.726 --> 08:15.318
I've got to meet you
there, Charlie.

08:15.361 --> 08:16.623
All right,
you can go in now.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.653
Look, the meeting starts
in less than two hours

08:18.698 --> 08:20.689
and you're always
ditching me for Vince.

08:20.733 --> 08:24.100
I know, I'm sorry.
But I got to go, Charlie. I will be there.

08:24.136 --> 08:27.731
- I'll see you in a little while.
- Yeah, okay.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.373
You've got to get me
out of here, Vin.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.137
Calm down, Dom.
Tell us what happened?

08:31.177 --> 08:33.804
Nothing did.
I panicked is all.

08:33.846 --> 08:34.972
Panicked from what?

08:35.014 --> 08:37.414
Maybe I was speeding.
I don't know.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.509
But a cop pulled up
behind me.

08:39.552 --> 08:42.679
I thought I had weed
in the glovebox.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.485
It's my mother-in-law's.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.492
It's not mine.
She's got glaucoma.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.984
But since I've been out here
I got a couple of strikes

08:50.029 --> 08:52.657
and the fear just kicked in
and I ran.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.996
- So you didn't do anything?
- Nothing.

08:55.034 --> 08:58.197
But if they charge me
with evading I'm looking at 30 years.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.966
Oh, Jesus, Dom.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.405
Please, Vin, you've got
to get me out of here.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.873
What do you want
us to do, Dom?

09:02.909 --> 09:05.241
Want us to overtake
the guards?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.269
- Sorry.
- No.

09:07.313 --> 09:09.247
I deserved that.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.217
But here's the thing...
I've changed.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.878
For real this time.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.117
I got a four-month-old
baby girl.

09:17.156 --> 09:20.683
I got the love of a beautiful
Oriental woman.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.853
I got a limo business.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.920
I go to church.

09:24.964 --> 09:26.932
But I need to get
out of here

09:26.966 --> 09:29.628
so I can look my girl
in the face and tell her I'm sorry.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.368
What do we have to do?

09:32.405 --> 09:33.804
Post bail.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.708
- Dom.
- I know it's a lot to ask, Vinnie.

09:37.743 --> 09:40.871
But I swear to my mother,
who you know and love,

09:40.913 --> 09:43.711
that I just need to go see
my girl and my baby

09:43.749 --> 09:46.980
and I'll come right back here
and you'll get your money back.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.754
- How much is your bail?
- 100 grand.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.621
Fuck that.

09:55.661 --> 09:57.720
- You've grown cold, E.
- Oh, come on.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.526
Hollywood has
made you cold.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.863
- You buying any of that nonsense?
- What nonsense?

10:01.901 --> 10:04.563
Thought he had weed in his car
and his mother-in-law has glaucoma.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.504
- Why would he lie about that?
- 'Cause he's an arch-criminal.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.507
- He lies about everything. He always has.
- I have to get him out.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.406
Why, so he can run off
and lose all the money?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.001
Guy's got a baby,
he's not gonna run.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.875
- How do you know?
- You think he's lying about that too?

10:13.913 --> 10:15.972
You actually think there's someone
out there that would fuck him?

10:16.015 --> 10:18.483
I don't care. I have to get him out.
If he runs, it's on me.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.644
- And the 100 grand?
- Well, that's on you.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.677
For now, I mean,
if you have it.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.350
Look, I really hate to ask,
but if you have it I'd appreciate it.

10:25.391 --> 10:28.019
- Do you have it?
- Why do you always believe in him?

10:28.060 --> 10:31.052
Why do you always believe in me?
Instinct.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.156
I've known Dom
for 25 years

10:33.199 --> 10:35.463
and my instinct says one day
he's gonna redeem himself.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.662
Yeah, well, I hope
that day is today.

10:37.703 --> 10:40.001
Think there's a B of A
around here?

10:41.941 --> 10:43.636
Oh, hold on, Alan.
You're aimed over here.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.701
- Really?
- Really.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.975
Aim here.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.107
Thank you, Phil.

10:52.551 --> 10:55.520
- Ha ha!
- Am I hot or what?

10:55.554 --> 10:57.920
En fuego, Alan.
En fuego.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.949
- I've got this idea.
- Freak.

11:00.993 --> 11:04.292
After we do the Ramones picture,
I got this great golf script.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.890
This aging pro falls
in love with his caddy

11:06.932 --> 11:08.263
and all hell breaks loose.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.291
Now is that something you
might be interested in?

11:10.336 --> 11:13.032
I could be, Bob.
I could be.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.699
If I keep beating Ari
like this

11:14.740 --> 11:16.503
we could be buying
the script with his cash.

11:16.542 --> 11:19.340
After I sink this putt,
it's just the beginning of my comeback.

11:19.378 --> 11:20.936
You've lost the last
eight holes, Ari.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.277
When you miss
I'm up 10 grand.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.441
I don't miss putts
inside 10 feet.

11:24.483 --> 11:26.678
- Even Bob knows that.
- How would I know that?

11:26.719 --> 11:29.654
The only putz I see
is standing in front of me.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.213
Good one, Bob.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.487
I'm surprised you can
hold the club with those slick hands.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.551
You got grease
running down your arms.

11:35.594 --> 11:37.323
Get your point
there, Bob.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.558
- Let him play, Bob.
- Sorry.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.024
My bad.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.969
Miss it, you scumbag!

11:48.007 --> 11:51.306
You guys are hysterical.

11:51.343 --> 11:52.970
Johnny, you come right here
and say your line.

11:53.012 --> 11:55.105
Then Brandon comes
from up here and says...

11:55.147 --> 11:56.842
What are you, stupid?

11:56.882 --> 11:58.144
Great.
Let's shoot it.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.880
Hold on a second.
Here's my guy.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.515
Finally.
He's mine, Casey, let him go.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.616
All right.

12:06.659 --> 12:09.628
- Where you been?
- Slicing bananas.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.597
Which wasn't easy to do
with a plastic knife. I did good, right?

12:12.631 --> 12:15.259
Too slow,
but you did all right.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.565
Johnny, let's go.

12:17.603 --> 12:19.935
Hold on a second.
I'm running on fumes.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.308
- What's this?
- What?

12:24.343 --> 12:26.038
These aren't
Raisin Bran raisins.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.204
Yeah they are.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.941
What, do you think
I'm stupid?

12:28.981 --> 12:30.778
What's that got to do
with anything?

12:30.816 --> 12:32.943
There's no sugar coating
on these raisins.

12:32.985 --> 12:35.249
The milk probably
washed it off.

12:36.655 --> 12:39.249
These are Sun-Maid raisins.
Don't fuck with my palate.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.156
- Any time now, Drama.
- Hold on a second.

12:41.193 --> 12:43.423
- I'm calling Vince.
- No no no, fine.

12:43.462 --> 12:44.690
They ran out
of Raisin Bran.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.391
So you couldn't
run to 7-11?

12:46.432 --> 12:47.865
- I didn't think I had enough time.
- No, you didn't think.

12:47.900 --> 12:50.300
And your not thinking
doesn't get me what I want.

12:50.336 --> 12:52.395
And when I don't get
what I want my day is done.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.407
- I'm sorry, Drama.
- Well, sorry don't fill my belly.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.237
What else can I do?

13:01.981 --> 13:03.448
All this.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.006
Go.

13:06.085 --> 13:08.349
Jesus. I thought Brandon
was an asshole.

13:08.387 --> 13:11.288
Yeah, Drama's in a class
all by himself.

13:11.323 --> 13:13.154
Sorry, I've got an idiot
for an assistant.

13:13.192 --> 13:15.422
They all have their days.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.259
That's why I put a Xanax in Brandon's
coffee every morning.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.232
- Come on.
- Oh yeah, look how relaxed he is.

13:21.267 --> 13:24.464
A happy boss
means a happy assistant.

13:24.503 --> 13:27.233
Find a way. Trust me, you'll have
much less work to do.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.037
Why couldn't you drop me
off at home first?

13:31.076 --> 13:32.509
I told you, Dom.
I'm late for this meeting.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.843
- I kinda got to get home.
- I'm gonna get you home.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.849
I thought the whole point of bailing me out
was 'cause you knew I needed to get home.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.147
Dom, I'm late. I couldn't drop you.
We're gonna be done soon.

13:40.186 --> 13:42.051
Please, just stick
close to me.

13:42.087 --> 13:44.248
- Stick close to you?
- Yeah.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.781
- Oh, look here.
- Sorry, Charlie.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.555
Don't worry about it.
We're just gonna walk right in.

13:48.594 --> 13:51.461
Oh hey. I want you to meet my
running-late manager.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.362
- This is Eric Murphy.
- How are you?

13:53.399 --> 13:56.197
- Vincent Chase.
- Oh, hi.

13:56.235 --> 13:58.703
Hey, Amy Miller.
Will you be joining us?

13:58.737 --> 14:00.466
Oh, everybody is.
We're all coming in.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.474
- I'm coming in?
- Yeah.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.839
Please.

14:03.876 --> 14:05.810
Why the fuck
am I coming in?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.109
Sorry about that.

14:08.147 --> 14:10.638
So...

14:10.683 --> 14:14.210
Vince, are you involved
with this project?

14:14.253 --> 14:16.983
I'm involved with
the management company,

14:17.022 --> 14:18.683
so I'm here to put
my support behind Charlie.

14:18.724 --> 14:20.214
Uh-huh, great.

14:20.259 --> 14:22.159
Well, Charlie, we can't wait
to hear what your ideas are.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.957
I loved what you did
at the Comedy Store.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.725
Thanks. I appreciate that.
Thanks a lot.

14:25.764 --> 14:28.392
We think Charlie's gonna
the next Chris Rock.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.493
Well, me personally, I think I'm more
of a Steve Martin kind of guy,

14:30.536 --> 14:32.026
but way to use
the race card, E.

14:32.071 --> 14:33.629
Oh, I get it.

14:33.672 --> 14:36.903
So anyway,
what's the idea?

14:36.942 --> 14:39.467
- E's gonna intro the premise.
- Uh, excuse me.

14:39.511 --> 14:42.674
Before you guys get started,
I just need to use the toilet.

14:47.119 --> 14:48.416
Okay.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.945
Uh, it's about...
it's about skate kids

14:50.990 --> 14:53.151
down by the beach.
It's called "Venice."

14:53.192 --> 14:54.921
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.929
You know what?
I need to use the bathroom too.

14:57.963 --> 15:00.397
I will be...
I'll be right back.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.264
Two minutes.

15:10.376 --> 15:12.276
- Vince is my new manager.
- Hey.

15:12.311 --> 15:14.541
Okay.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.138
I thought you had
to be in there, E.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.172
No, Charlie's got it
under control.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.344
- Seems like a nice kid.
- Oh yeah.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.483
Yup.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.888
- So you gonna piss or what?
- I'm pissing.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.790
Silent stream, huh?

15:31.830 --> 15:34.094
Whoo-hoo!

15:34.133 --> 15:35.794
Meeting's over?

15:35.834 --> 15:38.564
Just like when you fuck, E,
quick and straight to the point.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.732
- What did she say?
- It's a done deal. She wants a script.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.572
- Wow, that was fast.
- The kid's funny.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.579
That and Vince agreed
to do the pilot.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.342
Congratulations, guys.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.781
I must be a lucky charm.

15:51.817 --> 15:53.842
What do you say, Ari?
You want to just call it a day?

15:53.886 --> 15:56.047
You want to let me off
on the 20 grand I owe you?

15:56.088 --> 15:57.715
Otherwise
we play through.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.621
You could go down a lot
more if you go on, Ari.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.148
Yeah, I don't
think so, Phil. No.

16:01.193 --> 16:03.388
'Cause I'm just starting
to get loose, all right?

16:03.429 --> 16:05.454
I get stronger
by the hole

16:05.497 --> 16:07.226
whereas Alan
always gets weaker.

16:07.266 --> 16:08.494
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.729
Maybe you should raise
the stakes a little.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.600
That's a good idea, Bob.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.935
I have a lot
of good ideas, Alan.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.907
- Ari?
- I don't play for money.

16:15.941 --> 16:18.341
- I play for personal pride.
- What, are you a pussy?

16:18.377 --> 16:20.811
Alan, you're up 20 grand.

16:20.846 --> 16:23.644
- And I'm bored.
- All right, what do you want to play for?

16:23.682 --> 16:26.708
Well, how's 20
a hole sound?

16:28.320 --> 16:30.811
- I don't know.
- Too rich for your blood, Ari?

16:30.856 --> 16:34.314
I mean, I don't know what kind of profits
that little agency of yours is turning.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.123
If any.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.924
I'll tell you what.

16:37.963 --> 16:41.194
Why don't we play for 50 a hole?
But I don't want your money, Alan.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.894
Really?
What do you want?

16:44.103 --> 16:46.094
I want Vinnie in the movie.

16:46.138 --> 16:48.163
You swore you wouldn't
bring that up today.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.834
I didn't know you were
gonna be so competitive.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.672
You really are
a scumbag, Ari.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.473
I told you, Alan.
I know these things.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.037
Listen, it's the second lead.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.175
Whatever it is, doesn't matter 'cause
you'll never win. Go ahead, swing away.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.022
- Huh?
- Nice drive.

17:14.066 --> 17:15.863
Best of the day.

17:15.901 --> 17:18.096
Finally.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.900
Have you been
hustling me, Ari?

17:19.938 --> 17:21.371
I'm sure he has been.

17:21.406 --> 17:25.069
You got Phil fucking Mickelson
teaching you

17:25.109 --> 17:28.238
and this idiot yammering
in my ear all day and I'm hustling you?

17:28.280 --> 17:30.248
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna focus

17:30.282 --> 17:32.250
extra extra hard
from now on, Alan.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.184
Me too, me too, Ari.

17:34.219 --> 17:37.711
We stopped playing together, what was it,
10 years ago now, right?

17:37.756 --> 17:39.621
That's about
when I met Phil.

17:39.658 --> 17:42.024
Yeah, he saw
a real flaw in my game.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.052
Got me to fix it,
though.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.621
But actually, I haven't
used his advice today.

17:46.665 --> 17:49.065
Didn't seem to need it
until now.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.865
What advice
did he give you?

17:51.904 --> 17:54.896
Like me,
he's better as a lefty.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.175
Thank you, Phil.

17:58.210 --> 18:02.374
Are you in trouble
now, Ari.

18:06.051 --> 18:08.246
Whoa.
Ha ha.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.983
Big trouble, Ari.
Big trouble.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.116
Will you just die
already, Bob?

18:18.063 --> 18:19.587
What's up, boss?

18:19.631 --> 18:21.826
- How'd you get back so fast?
- Good shoes.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.960
No, seriously.
You do everything on the list?

18:24.002 --> 18:25.469
No, not everything.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.369
- You get my dry cleaning?
- No.

18:27.406 --> 18:29.431
Did you get my picture
from the framing store?

18:29.475 --> 18:30.669
Nope.

18:30.709 --> 18:33.041
Did you get my Peter Thomas Roth
anti-aging cleansing gel?

18:33.078 --> 18:35.444
- I did not.
- What did you get me?

18:35.481 --> 18:37.142
This.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.580
- Who's that?
- It's an extra.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.110
You're her
favorite character.

18:43.155 --> 18:44.520
What am I supposed
to do with her?

18:44.556 --> 18:46.046
Fuck her.
What do you think?

18:46.091 --> 18:48.958
You think I need you to pick
up extras for me to bang?

18:48.994 --> 18:52.395
I did have to charm about 20 of them
before I found one that would say yes.

18:52.431 --> 18:54.092
Do you know
how stupid this is?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.124
- I thought it'd make you happy.
- No, it doesn't make me happy.

18:56.168 --> 18:57.931
I can't have an extra
in my trailer.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.438
I got sexual harassment
lawsuits coming out of my ass as it is.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.270
- I never heard about those.
- I don't tell you everything.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.435
You said you wanted
an assistant you could bang.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.469
Yeah, because you pay
an assistant to keep her mouth shut.

19:08.514 --> 19:11.074
These girls are just jerking
their way to a lawsuit.

19:11.116 --> 19:13.380
Between this and my meltdown
on "The View"

19:13.418 --> 19:15.113
you could get me
thrown off the show.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.179
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, me too...

19:17.222 --> 19:19.156
for agreeing to this.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.785
- Now get her out of here quietly.
- Okay.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.692
Then go wait in the car.

19:26.532 --> 19:29.524
Hello?
Anybody home?

19:31.470 --> 19:33.062
I don't think
anybody's here.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.868
I thought you were in such a rush
'cause they were waiting.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.636
They must have stepped
out for a minute.

19:36.675 --> 19:39.337
- You want to call them?
- No, I'm sure they'll be back any minute.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.403
- You guys want something to drink?
- Sure, what do you got?

19:41.446 --> 19:43.141
- You name it, I got it.
- I'll have a beer.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.740
Yeah, me too.

19:44.783 --> 19:47.343
- E, why so close?
- What?

19:47.386 --> 19:49.752
I feel like you're about
to attempt a prison rape.

19:49.788 --> 19:52.018
- What's up?
- Nothing.

19:52.057 --> 19:54.924
- What's up, Vin?
- E thinks you're gonna jump bail.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.485
Come on,
you think that?

19:57.529 --> 20:00.589
Yeah, well, you did try to outrun a bunch
of police officers, Dom.

20:00.632 --> 20:02.156
I thought I explained that
to you sufficiently.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.101
He doubts you, Dom.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.331
So that's why you followed
me to take a piss.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.669
Wow, he really looks after
your money, huh, Vince?

20:08.707 --> 20:10.732
Actually, Dom,
it's his money.

20:10.776 --> 20:12.209
I've hit a bit
of a rough patch.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.176
You put up
the money, E?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.511
Yup.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.880
Wow, after all I've done...

20:18.917 --> 20:20.384
I mean, I expected Vince
to come through,

20:20.419 --> 20:22.353
but E doing that,
I mean, that means a lot.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.912
Just put his mind at ease
that you're not gonna run.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.925
Well, I'm a little more likely
to since it's not your money, Vince.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.859
Dom.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.192
Be at ease, E.
'Cause, come on,

20:31.230 --> 20:34.199
do you think if I decided to run
you'd be able to stop me?

20:38.670 --> 20:40.194
Oh shit, that's them.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.264
Don't say a word
about this.

20:42.307 --> 20:43.774
I got to wait for
the right moment.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.141
I'm not gonna
say anything.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.169
There are my two beauties.

20:49.314 --> 20:50.975
Come here,
my little lzzybear.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.018
- I tried calling you.
- I'm sorry, phone was on the fritz.

20:55.053 --> 20:56.953
There's a baby.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.423
Careful, Ma.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.926
And a blind
mother-in-law.

21:03.061 --> 21:04.551
Whew.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.690
- Sylvi, these are my friends.
- Hey.

21:07.733 --> 21:10.600
- Hey, this is my mother.
- Hi.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.900
- And Vince?
- Yes, hi.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.735
How are you?
And you're E?

21:14.773 --> 21:16.741
Yeah, how'd you
know that?

21:16.775 --> 21:18.709
Dom showed me so many pictures
of you guys when you were children.

21:18.744 --> 21:22.271
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm so glad to see you all together.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.305
I know how angry you were
after what he did.

21:24.349 --> 21:27.045
Dom told you about that?

21:27.085 --> 21:28.484
Oh, he tells me
everything.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.249
Yeah, we made a pact
before we had little lzzy.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.484
Ma.

21:32.524 --> 21:35.084
- Careful up the steps, Ma.
- Ma.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.561
Easy.

21:37.596 --> 21:40.793
Wow.
Dom's a dad.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.124
Can you believe
he's the best dad?

21:44.169 --> 21:45.602
Unbelievable.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.497
He is.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.475
Ma.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.410
- Who is this?
- Say hi.

21:57.449 --> 22:00.077
- Hey there.
- I'm Uncle Vince.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.915
- You got this one, Alan.
- Are you sure?

22:05.957 --> 22:08.187
No doubt.

22:14.566 --> 22:15.692
Your move, Ari.

22:15.734 --> 22:18.202
Etiquette.
Farthest guy out goes first.

22:18.236 --> 22:20.329
You've got to cup
this one to tie, Ari.

22:20.372 --> 22:22.932
- It's not an easy shot.
- No shit, Bob.

22:22.974 --> 22:25.135
- Any advice there, Phil?
- Pray, Ari.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.475
Don't bother.
I'm sure God

22:27.512 --> 22:29.912
gave up on you
a long time ago.

22:36.088 --> 22:37.817
Oh.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.721
I'm so sorry.

22:39.758 --> 22:42.226
So sorry to you
and Mr. Chase.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.956
You know, you really are a fucking gutless
prick. You know that, Ari?

22:44.996 --> 22:46.964
Oh well.

22:46.998 --> 22:49.091
I'll tell you what...
I'll tell you what.

22:53.271 --> 22:55.671
- Make that.
- What?

22:56.842 --> 23:00.471
One more shot for your
favorite pretty boy client.

23:00.512 --> 23:02.639
Go ahead, make it.
Show me you got some guts.

23:02.681 --> 23:05.946
Make the putt and he's in
and you're the hero.

23:05.984 --> 23:09.010
You miss it
and you're both losers.

23:26.538 --> 23:29.939
Oh well. You know what?
Fuck both of you, Ari.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.102
You hear me?
Fuck you both.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.237
I lost, Alan.
Why are you so angry?

23:34.279 --> 23:36.611
I'm so angry 'cause
I don't fucking like you.

23:36.648 --> 23:39.048
- And I don't like that fucking kid.
- Okay, all right.

23:39.084 --> 23:42.315
And you come out here when I tell you
not to bring up his fucking name again

23:42.354 --> 23:44.879
- and you ruin my fucking day.
- Calm down.

23:44.923 --> 23:48.017
Don't you ever tell me to calm down!
You hear me?

23:48.059 --> 23:50.687
Don't you ever fucking
tell me to calm down,

23:50.729 --> 23:53.061
you fucking prick
cocksucker!

23:57.903 --> 23:59.564
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.299
Alan, are you okay?

24:01.339 --> 24:02.772
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine!

24:02.808 --> 24:04.571
I'm... I'm fucking fine.

24:06.678 --> 24:09.579
Nice fucking
relaxing day, huh?

24:09.614 --> 24:11.479
- Take a seat, Alan.
- I'm fine. I said I'm...

24:11.516 --> 24:13.711
- Oh fuck!
- You all right?

24:13.752 --> 24:15.879
- I said I'm fine!
- Call 911 fast.

24:15.921 --> 24:18.389
- I'm gonna call a doctor.
- Oh God.

24:18.423 --> 24:20.050
Somebody call a doctor!

24:22.093 --> 24:25.654
Come on, Alan.
Think positive thoughts.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.297
- What's this?
- Got the list done.

24:34.339 --> 24:36.830
- The whole list?
- Everything.

24:36.875 --> 24:39.435
And highlighted
your sides for tomorrow.

24:41.847 --> 24:43.542
Thanks.

24:47.352 --> 24:50.412
- Look, I was hard on you today.
- You think?

24:50.455 --> 24:53.185
I mean, most guys would
be thrilled to see a girl

24:53.225 --> 24:54.852
in her underwear sitting
in their trailer,

24:54.893 --> 24:58.329
- but I'm not like most.
- No, you are not.

24:58.363 --> 25:01.958
Anyway, you proved something
to me right now.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.561
More importantly, I think you
proved something to yourself.

25:05.604 --> 25:08.129
You think this is a job
you want to keep?

25:08.173 --> 25:09.538
Why, you want to keep me?

25:09.574 --> 25:11.974
I mean, you were rough
in patches,

25:12.010 --> 25:14.001
but I think you could
grow into it.

25:14.045 --> 25:15.603
You gonna tell Vince
I did good?

25:15.647 --> 25:17.808
I already did,
on the phone.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.316
Even before I did all this?

25:19.351 --> 25:21.376
I'll bury you at work

25:21.419 --> 25:23.683
but never to
the outside world.

25:23.722 --> 25:26.054
I'm gonna toughen you up,
though, Turtle.

25:26.091 --> 25:27.524
- Oh.
- That sound good?

25:27.559 --> 25:29.720
- Is the day officially over?
- Yup.

25:29.761 --> 25:31.661
Then it sounds great.

25:33.999 --> 25:36.058
- You're not gonna get the door for me?
- Nope.

25:36.101 --> 25:37.693
What are you doing?

25:37.736 --> 25:39.465
Telling you I quit,
you jerkoff.

25:39.504 --> 25:41.096
What?

25:45.911 --> 25:48.277
He's coming back.

25:50.348 --> 25:52.179
He's coming back.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.185
Everything was
amazing, Sylvi.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.278
- Truly incredible. Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

25:56.321 --> 25:57.754
My pleasure.

25:57.789 --> 26:00.223
- Thanks, babe.
- Okay. I'll be back.

26:02.727 --> 26:05.355
I don't know how
I'm gonna tell her.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.865
Just be honest.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.495
It's gonna break her heart.

26:11.536 --> 26:14.164
She don't deserve it.

26:17.542 --> 26:19.601
I love you guys
for being here.

26:19.644 --> 26:21.703
I really do.

26:22.814 --> 26:23.974
Say bye.

26:27.385 --> 26:28.909
Do you feel guilty now?

26:28.954 --> 26:31.821
Yeah.
Maybe he's changed a little.

26:31.856 --> 26:35.690
Third grade when Mikey Cammerata
tried to kick your ass...

26:35.727 --> 26:37.354
- Yup.
...who stopped him?

26:37.395 --> 26:39.090
- Dom.
- Dom.

26:39.130 --> 26:40.620
And in fifth grade he wanted
to kick your ass.

26:40.665 --> 26:42.223
Dom stopped him again.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.100
- To Dom.
- To Dom.

26:47.706 --> 26:49.606
Oh, you got to
be kidding me.

26:57.916 --> 26:59.975
- I don't believe this.
- I do.

27:00.018 --> 27:02.179
I'm so stupid.
I never should have trusted him.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.383
No one ever should have.

27:05.423 --> 27:06.981
Dom.

27:09.194 --> 27:12.027
She told me if I ever
went to jail again

27:12.063 --> 27:13.496
she would leave me.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.561
I thought if I could
just explain

27:18.603 --> 27:21.572
she would understand.

27:24.943 --> 27:26.638
You can take me
to jail now, E.

27:29.581 --> 27:33.176
- Poor Dom.
- Poor Dom.

27:33.218 --> 27:35.209
I promised to testify
at his parole hearing.

27:35.253 --> 27:37.619
- That might help.
- Yeah, in 2020 it might.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.988
- You guys did all you could.
- Yeah, we did.

27:40.025 --> 27:42.152
And I'm proud of you, Turtle,
for delivering today.

27:44.829 --> 27:47.696
I just walked nine miles.
You're a dick.

27:47.732 --> 27:48.892
Why didn't you call a cab?

27:48.933 --> 27:50.992
Out of principle
and to prove you're a dick.

27:51.036 --> 27:53.231
Johnny, I thought you said
he did a good job.

27:53.271 --> 27:55.535
Yeah, as a worker
he was okay.

27:55.573 --> 27:58.474
As a friend he's a animal.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.807
Give me some
good news, Ari.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.404
Well, I lost the bet.

28:02.447 --> 28:05.780
Oh great. Maybe you could organize
a poker game with him tomorrow.

28:05.817 --> 28:08.012
No, E.

28:08.053 --> 28:10.851
That's gonna be a little
difficult seeing as how Alan is dead.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.351
What?

28:13.391 --> 28:15.086
He's dead, Eric.

28:15.126 --> 28:17.185
The joy of me losing

28:17.228 --> 28:19.458
was too much for his
angry little heart.

28:19.497 --> 28:22.591
- So what now?
- Well...

28:22.634 --> 28:25.398
now I go home to the family
'cause I realize life is short.

28:25.437 --> 28:28.372
And tomorrow we can see
how alive Vinnie is.

28:28.406 --> 28:31.000
Listen, be well.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.408
Alan's dead.
He had a heart attack.

28:37.549 --> 28:40.416
Jesus, that's awful.

28:42.520 --> 28:43.851
Is it, bro?
