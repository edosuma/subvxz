08:56.494 --> 08:57.662
- Zoey, what brings
you to my room?

08:57.745 --> 09:00.623
- I need a favor.
- Well, sure, just ask.

09:00.706 --> 09:02.208

your model by yourself

09:02.291 --> 09:03.626

09:03.709 --> 09:05.795

- Mr. Davenport specifically
assigned Michael and myself

09:07.713 --> 09:10.049
to re-create
the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Okay, tell you what.

09:22.853 --> 09:23.980

- You will?

go out with Logan?

He's scrumptious.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.458
And his arms.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.003
Oh, his arms.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.172
Come on,
you're friends with him.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.382
- Yeah, sorta.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.551
- Then get me
a date with him

09:53.634 --> 09:56.262
and I'll finish
this pyramid solo.

09:56.345 --> 09:57.305

17:11.655 --> 17:13.031
- Oh, you're used to it.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.157
- Well, come on, did they say
they'd leave Chase alone?

17:14.241 --> 17:17.118
- Yes, they agreed
to leave Chase alone.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.287
- Good.
- If...

17:18.369 --> 17:19.872
- Another if?
- Yeah.

17:19.954 --> 17:21.623
If you can get
Quinn to give them

17:21.707 --> 17:23.709
some computer operating
system she designed.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.752
- What operating system?
- I don't--

17:25.836 --> 17:26.962
- Quinn made the best
operating system ever,

17:27.045 --> 17:29.798
but she won't let anyone
else use it.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.718
It's called
Quinndows QP and I want it.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.845
- Okay, if I get Quinn
to give you Quinndows QP,

17:34.928 --> 17:35.512
you guys promise
you'll quit bugging Chase?

17:35.596 --> 17:37.765
- Absolutely.

17:37.848 --> 17:38.390
- Okay, I'll handle it.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.350
- Sweet.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.518
Neil out.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.855
Hey, um...

17:44.938 --> 17:47.024
I don't know if you have
plans next Saturday night--

17:47.107 --> 17:48.025
- Stop.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.359
- I know.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.569
[all snickering]

17:50.652 --> 17:52.196
Go get me some pudding!

17:57.868 --> 17:59.870
- I can't give them
Quinndows QP.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.079
- You have to.
I promised the nerds!

18:01.163 --> 18:02.790
Zoey--
- If you don't give it to them,

18:02.873 --> 18:04.041
they won't leave Chase alone.
- But I--

18:04.124 --> 18:06.085
- Chase won't babysit
Mr. Bender's kid,

18:06.168 --> 18:07.836
which means Lola won't be
Dustin's assistant

18:07.920 --> 18:09.004
for his magic show.
- I get it, but--

18:09.087 --> 18:11.048
- Then Dustin won't
give Logan his ring back

18:11.131 --> 18:12.508
and then Logan won't go out
with Stacey--

18:12.591 --> 18:14.259
- Can I just
please get a word?

18:14.343 --> 18:16.011
- Then Stacey won't finish her
history project without Michael

18:16.095 --> 18:17.387
and then Michael won't
be able to make his

18:17.471 --> 18:18.680
grandma's ravioli for Coco!
- If I could just--

18:18.764 --> 18:21.058
- Then Coco won't drive me
to the Book Nook,

18:21.141 --> 18:23.185
and I'll never meet
JT Hawthorne and I'll cry!

18:23.268 --> 18:25.562
- There is no Quinndows QP!

18:25.646 --> 18:27.439
- What do you mean?
- I lost it.

18:27.523 --> 18:31.485
Mark spilled clam juice all
over my hard drive and poof!

18:31.568 --> 18:33.237
It was unrecoverable.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.822
I don't have it anymore.

18:34.905 --> 18:35.614
- Quinn!

18:35.697 --> 18:37.115
- It's gone.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.158
- No!

18:38.242 --> 18:40.077
No, no, no!

18:40.953 --> 18:41.954
Do you know
what this means?

18:42.037 --> 18:45.082
Do you know what
this means?!

18:45.165 --> 18:47.084
- [squealing]

18:50.212 --> 18:51.463
- Well?

18:51.547 --> 18:52.381
- Quinn lost
the operating system.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.423
- What?

18:53.507 --> 18:55.884
- What?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.220
- Well, then that means
we don't have to keep our

18:58.303 --> 19:00.222
promise to Zoey.
- Good.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.599
Let's go make
Chase our leader again!

19:02.683 --> 19:04.101
ALL: Yeah!

19:07.020 --> 19:09.606
- Hey, Chase.
- Chase, Chase!

19:09.690 --> 19:10.732
- The X-Men...

19:10.816 --> 19:13.026
[overlapping talking]

19:17.865 --> 19:19.157
- And now,
ladies and gentlemen,

19:19.241 --> 19:22.744
my assistant Lola
will climb into the box

19:22.828 --> 19:24.705
and then I'll
saw her in two.

[applauding]

19:27.875 --> 19:31.545
[baby cooing]

19:31.628 --> 19:34.089

19:34.173 --> 19:36.049
Chase, I thought
you said you would--

19:38.135 --> 19:40.053
[baby cooing]

19:40.137 --> 19:41.221
Sorry.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.306
[audience groans]

19:42.389 --> 19:43.765

we had a deal.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.393
Where are you going?

19:46.476 --> 19:49.855
[audience booing]

19:51.899 --> 19:52.941
- And this one time,
I was at this

19:53.025 --> 19:54.526
fantasy sci-fi convention.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.611
There was this guy who was
dressed up like an android,

19:55.694 --> 19:57.946
but it was really,
really, really realistic

19:58.030 --> 19:59.489
and so for a moment,
I thought he was actually real.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.949
So I actually followed him
around for, like, three hours

20:01.033 --> 20:02.784
'cause I thought he'd go back
to the mother ship

20:02.868 --> 20:04.286
and I'd get to see it,

20:04.369 --> 20:05.871
but it turns out he didn't
because then he took off

20:05.954 --> 20:06.914
and he was just
some guy from Tulsa.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.832
And then this one time,
for Halloween,

20:08.916 --> 20:09.875
I dressed up like
Marie Antoinette, but, like,

20:09.958 --> 20:11.877
if the guillotine had
kind of failed,

20:11.960 --> 20:13.253
so I had to do all
this really weird makeup.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.296
It was so funny.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.843

[screaming]

20:27.935 --> 20:29.019

20:29.102 --> 20:30.979
Michael Barret, come
and help me with this.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.940
- Look, I'm gonna
finish the ravioli,

20:33.023 --> 20:34.483
then I'm going to
help you, okay?

20:34.566 --> 20:35.817
I don't care who ran away!

20:35.901 --> 20:37.027
- What the heck is
that supposed to mean?

20:37.110 --> 20:38.779
- Look, okay, look,
I'll help you later.

20:38.862 --> 20:39.780
Just let me finish
the ravioli.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.282
Look my grandma
will be mad if--hey!

20:42.366 --> 20:43.742
- Zoey, Zoey!

20:43.825 --> 20:45.827
- Zoey, you need to
tell her we had a deal.

20:45.911 --> 20:49.581
Okay, you need to take her--
- Just make the ravioli.

20:49.665 --> 20:53.752
[all shouting]

20:53.835 --> 20:55.170

is not that cool,

20:57.255 --> 20:58.090

20:58.173 --> 20:59.633
You know what? Fine!
- What?!

20:59.716 --> 21:00.592
- You know what? Fine.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.511
That's it.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.303
- Well, yes and no.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.680
- What does that mean?

21:46.763 --> 21:48.265
Well, Michael got mad
and he tossed the ravioli

21:48.348 --> 21:51.143
in the garbage can
before he cooked it.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.812
- So you expect me to
drive you to the Book Nook

of uncooked ravioli

21:55.939 --> 21:58.233
