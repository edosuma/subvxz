00:10.885 --> 00:12.595
Leia, take the picture.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.974
My eyes are burning. I need to blink.

00:17.058 --> 00:20.437
There's only 24 pictures on this camera,
and I don't want to waste any of them.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.734
Twenty-three.
I just took one of Ozzie's butt.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.319
Send me a copy.
I can never get a good angle.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.865
Why don't I take the pictures?

00:31.948 --> 00:34.659
Oh great! Try to make me look really cool.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.161
It's just a camera.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.205
Ready to party?

00:39.289 --> 00:41.416
I got the snacks. Nate's got the keg.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.086
Sorry!

00:46.421 --> 00:48.757
I walked into a spiderweb,
and she got away from me.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.759
Dude, it's Leia's last night,

00:50.842 --> 00:52.927
and you brought that nasty keg
from Fourth of July?

00:53.011 --> 00:55.597
I took care of this thing
like it's my baby.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.974
Till I dropped it down the stairs.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.851
Just like Mom did to you?

01:00.852 --> 01:02.062
Burn!

01:06.983 --> 01:07.817
Bro.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.110
Bro.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.279
Bro.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.198
Old, flat, skunky beer?

01:13.990 --> 01:15.533
We are not this desperate.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.521
I think I'm a really good dancer.

01:45.021 --> 01:47.232
It's your last night, so… sure.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.194
Ozzie, are you gonna be sad when I'm gone?

01:51.277 --> 01:53.321
Uh…

01:54.322 --> 01:55.448
No.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.076
He isn't great
about expressing his emotions.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.829
If I say how I feel,
people say how they feel.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.373
And I don't care.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.544
Well, this is the perfect last night
to cap off the perfect summer.

02:07.627 --> 02:08.670
I'll drink to that.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.422
Bro.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.300
I was worried when you had that talk
with Leia about breaking things off,

02:14.384 --> 02:15.677
it was gonna harsh the mood.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.594
But it didn't!

02:16.678 --> 02:17.887
I'm having a blast!

02:19.681 --> 02:20.765
I haven't told her yet.

02:22.851 --> 02:23.852
What?

02:27.355 --> 02:28.356
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

02:39.492 --> 02:42.036
<i>Hello, Wisconsin!</i>

02:43.246 --> 02:46.374
-You're breaking up with me?
-No, no, no. Don't say it like that.

02:46.457 --> 02:47.709
It's not a breakup.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.544
It's like we were boyfriend
and girlfriend,

02:49.627 --> 02:50.587
but we're gonna stop.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.630
That's a breakup, you donk!

02:53.756 --> 02:56.968
Oh my God, I'm one of
your summer things, you jerk.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.432
Whoa. She cheesied your deezy.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.227
Leia, I'm not being a jerk.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.271
We're gonna be apart for nine months.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.106
Long distance relationships are hard.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.524
Hard.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.404
I don't want to put us through that.

03:16.487 --> 03:18.740
So that's it? We're not even gonna try?

03:18.823 --> 03:21.659
Leia, I know you're upset,
but he's making a lot of sense.

03:21.743 --> 03:25.205
This way you both can go off
and live your lives. Right, babe?

03:25.288 --> 03:27.373
Yeah, long distance is nuts.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.292
Nuts.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.588
It's not for the faint of heart.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.424
Do you know how much it costs
to call my boyfriend in Canada?

03:36.925 --> 03:39.677
Well, your grandparents
are about to find out.

03:41.012 --> 03:41.971
Gwen, help me out here.

03:42.722 --> 03:43.890
He has a point.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.016
You're with <i>them</i>?

03:45.099 --> 03:46.601
No, I'm looking out for you.

03:46.684 --> 03:49.145
I mean, it <i>is </i>a long time apart, and also…

03:49.812 --> 03:50.647
man-whore.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.483
-Unbelievable!
-Leia…

03:53.566 --> 03:56.069
Do not follow me!
I am not afraid to use this thing!

04:00.073 --> 04:01.783
Hold on. Let me get her.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.409
Leia, phone!

04:07.830 --> 04:10.750
I thought you'd be in a worse mood,
what with Leia leaving.

04:10.833 --> 04:15.213
I was upset, but then I realized
she won't be gone for long.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.673
Her boyfriend is here,

04:16.756 --> 04:18.299
her best friend lives next door,

04:18.383 --> 04:20.760
and she loves my potato salad.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.179
And what about me? I'm fun.

04:27.892 --> 04:28.768
Hey, Grandma.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.186
Hi, sweetie. It's Jay.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.104
Oh.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.022
-You suck!

04:34.107 --> 04:34.941
Oh dear.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.402
Hey, Leia. You feeling any better?

04:43.491 --> 04:45.535
Oh, I just… I… I don't think she is.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.872
Okay, so what's going on here?

04:49.956 --> 04:52.625
Boyfriend stuff, me stuff,

04:52.709 --> 04:55.503
and yesterday she got sick
from some weird potato salad.

04:55.586 --> 04:59.007
Oh my God! Those are the big-ticket items!

04:59.090 --> 05:02.635
She may not want to come back
next summer. I gotta talk to her.

05:02.719 --> 05:03.553
Good luck.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.223
Oh no.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.600
Don't everyone leave.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.813
Then it'll just be me and my newspaper.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.696
Your tree could've killed someone.
I should sue.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.614
<i>My</i> tree?

05:24.115 --> 05:26.242
That tree came from your property.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.746
Oh, then we'll call it an act of God.
Could've happened to the best of us.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.332
But it didn't happen to the best of us.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.708
It happened to you.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.462
I have been telling you
that this tree is rotting,

05:37.545 --> 05:38.921
and you need to take care of it.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.506
I've been busy.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.008
Doing what?

05:42.091 --> 05:43.092
That would be me.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.640
Oh, come on!

05:49.724 --> 05:51.434
You had time to put on pants.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.519
My pants take time to wiggle into.

05:54.937 --> 05:57.148
Sometimes I have to, uh, grease my thighs.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.567
<i>This</i> is attractive to you?

06:00.068 --> 06:03.738
We bumped into each other at the Chili's,
and we decided to give it another try.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.949
<i>Yeah, it turned out I wanted…
</i>

06:08.826 --> 06:10.787
Could we get back to the tree?

06:10.870 --> 06:14.332
You need to get ahold of your landlord
and get rid of this.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.875
Oh, that guy's a real piece of work.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.336
Can you talk to him?
You're so good at yellin' at people.

06:19.253 --> 06:20.546
Fine, I'll take care of it.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.049
Thanks, Red. You're a lifesaver.
I'll go call him right now.

06:23.132 --> 06:24.592
I'll be right in.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.596
-Did you do have fun cutting off my balls?
-What?

06:29.347 --> 06:31.766
I should be the one
dealing with the landlord.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.185
I need Sherri to see
that I am invested in our relationship.

06:34.268 --> 06:37.438
Fine, call the landlord.

06:37.522 --> 06:40.191
Just get this tree outta my driveway.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.526
Oh, Mr. Red!

06:43.820 --> 06:45.279
-What the hell?!

06:47.031 --> 06:50.076
I don't know what you heard,
but… this show ain't free.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.997
They eat my popsicles,
they take over my basement,

06:55.081 --> 06:57.166
and they turn my life upside down.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.209
Dumbasses!

06:58.292 --> 07:01.546
Okay, now you're starting
to sound like your grandpa.

07:01.629 --> 07:05.591
Let's not forget how much you love it here
and how you can't wait to come back.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.884
Come back?

07:06.968 --> 07:10.304
I… I just want to get out of this…
this crappy Podunk town.

07:10.388 --> 07:14.517
Well, I have carved out
a pretty nice life here in Point Place.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.686
But I guess that doesn't matter.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.813
Hey. I know I'm early.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.356
Mom.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.482
I tried to call,

07:21.566 --> 07:24.402
but it sounded like someone was
banging the phone around in a pot.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.487
Mom, thank God you're here.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.864
Everything's ruined.

07:27.947 --> 07:31.325
My boyfriend broke up with me,
and for some reason I took it out on Gwen.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.869
-Boyfriend?
-Jay Kelso.

07:33.953 --> 07:34.954
Kelso?

07:35.872 --> 07:38.749
We talk all the time.
You don't mention any of this?

07:38.833 --> 07:42.587
Well, no, I think…
I think what is truly important here

07:42.670 --> 07:45.381
is that Leia had a hoot this summer.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.175
Which she seems to be forgetting.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.344
Movie nights,
trips to the lake house, the rave--

07:50.428 --> 07:53.055
-A rave?
-Oh, don't be such a square, Donna.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.808
Look, I'll explain everything in the car.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.894
Right now I just need
to get out of this hellhole.

07:58.603 --> 08:02.064
Well, would a hellhole have
such a catchy commercial?

08:08.070 --> 08:10.156
-Let me… talk to her for a sec?
Fine.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.409
George Harrison's sister lived here.

08:19.248 --> 08:20.458
Mom, I…

08:20.541 --> 08:21.792
I feel so stupid.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.087
I thought I was having
this perfect summer, and…

08:27.006 --> 08:28.090
now it's all ruined.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.635
Honey, breakups suck.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.970
How would you know?
You've been with Dad since high school.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.806
-Actually, we broke up a lot.
-You did?

08:35.890 --> 08:39.268
Yeah, and one of those times
I dated Jay's uncle, Casey.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.228
A Kelso?

08:41.729 --> 08:42.605
Yeah.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.567
Look, being a teenager gets messy.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.821
Whenever I was going through something,
you know who helped me through it?

08:50.905 --> 08:51.989
My friends.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.534
So just go talk to Gwen.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.329
What is it with these Kelsos?

08:58.412 --> 09:01.082
-It's the hair.
-I know. It's so perfect.

09:03.709 --> 09:06.420
Thanks again for helping me
deal with my landlord.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.381
That was the sexiest thing
you've ever done.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.633
I mean, besides the way
you say "pistachio."

09:10.716 --> 09:11.592
Mmm…

09:12.093 --> 09:14.136
-Pistachio.

09:18.182 --> 09:21.018
I don't know what's happening,
but it seems weird.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.437
Oh, Gwen. You remember my friend, Fez?

09:23.521 --> 09:26.023
Yeah, your "friend" used all my bodywash.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.277
It's so nice to meet
another fan of the cucumber-melon.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.530
Can I have 20 bucks?
I need to get something for Leia.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.699
Oh, allow me.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.329
Oh yeah, I feel it.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.335
Fifty it is.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.505
Thanks, new Dad.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.925
Oh, that was awful sweet of you.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.677
Well, I'm a problem solver, baby.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.429
Oh. Good.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.097
'Cause my landlord's here.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.183
So…

10:04.895 --> 10:06.188
Oh…

10:07.189 --> 10:08.649
It's you.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.486
-Fenton, what are you doing here?
-I own this place.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.698
Along with three other homes,
one duplex, and a Dippin' Dots.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.451
Yeah. Take it all in, Fez.

10:18.534 --> 10:20.703
This is what success looks like.

10:22.204 --> 10:25.374
Oh, I know what success looks like.
Have you heard of Chez Fez?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.959
Barely.

10:27.043 --> 10:30.212
I sat through one of your annoying
commercials when I was in the bath.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.341
I'd already put in my salt, so I didn't
wanna get out and change the channel.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.759
Which is a long way of saying

10:34.842 --> 10:37.136
I have a TV in my bathroom, bitch.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.224
Okay, then! Now that we're
all caught up on everything, I guess--

10:42.308 --> 10:43.392
When you signed your lease,

10:43.476 --> 10:48.272
it specifically said
no pets over 150 pounds.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.732
I'm 149!

10:49.815 --> 10:50.858
With those thighs?

10:50.941 --> 10:54.445
-I'd rather these thighs than that face.
-I'd rather this face than those shoes.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.864
-I'd rather these shoes than no hair.
-Go to hell!

10:56.947 --> 10:58.199
I'll see you there!

11:02.078 --> 11:05.539
Let's not get our panties in a bunch.
We still gotta deal with that tree.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.250
I'm not touching that tree
until you pay your rent.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.045
-Which just went up because of that.
-What?

11:11.128 --> 11:13.506
And stay the hell away from
my Dippin' Dots!

11:13.589 --> 11:16.967
You will never taste
the ice cream of the future.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.435
-Pistach--
-I am not in the mood!

11:30.314 --> 11:31.565
Hi, Jay.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.526
Mrs. Forman?

11:33.609 --> 11:35.361
It's time we had a little chat.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.613
How did you know I was here?

11:38.280 --> 11:41.367
Oh, this is my town, sweetie.
I have eyes everywhere.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.495
How's Leia doing?

11:44.995 --> 11:49.041
I mean, I feel really bad about
how things went down, but I had to do it.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.836
Well, that is what
I wanted to talk to you about.

11:51.919 --> 11:55.172
She is so upset,
she may not come back next summer.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.382
That's not what I wanted.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.092
This isn't about you!

12:03.764 --> 12:07.101
No, no, it <i>is</i> about you, honey.
You were saying?

12:07.184 --> 12:09.395
I wasn't trying to hurt her, Mrs. Forman.

12:09.895 --> 12:13.983
It's just, you know, anything can happen.
What if she meets someone else?

12:14.066 --> 12:17.153
Or what if I get asked
to star in the next <i>Karate Kid?</i>

12:17.236 --> 12:19.238
I mean, I'd have to move to Reseda!

12:22.116 --> 12:23.117
Okay, okay.

12:24.493 --> 12:28.330
Let me tell you a little story about
a long distance relationship of mine.

12:29.081 --> 12:32.293
I was dating this boy
I was madly in love with.

12:32.376 --> 12:35.671
And then the war started.
He was being shipped overseas.

12:35.755 --> 12:36.922
World War I?

12:44.847 --> 12:48.642
Anyway, we decided
we would still give it a shot.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.687
And I never regretted that decision.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.813
And that guy was Red?

12:52.897 --> 12:54.982
No, I think his name was Steve.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.318
So your point is
long distance doesn't work?

12:57.401 --> 12:58.402
Not with Steve.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.572
He had a giant belly button.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.033
I could see it through his sweaters.

13:07.161 --> 13:10.414
The point is, at least we tried.

13:10.998 --> 13:14.502
Honey, don't go through life
wondering what could have been.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.797
You're squeezing my hand pretty hard,
Mrs. Forman.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.549
I <i>really</i> want you to give it a try.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.218
It's getting tighter.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.553
I open a lot of mayonnaise jars.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.225
Shh.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.228
A fly landed on my crotch, and I'm trying
to decide if it's worth the swat.

13:33.854 --> 13:36.315
-Damn. It flew away.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.609
That's probably a good thing.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.862
-Oh, where's Gwen?
-She's out somewhere.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.698
I don't want to leave
without saying goodbye to her.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.408
I totally overreacted.

13:47.034 --> 13:50.538
This is my first breakup,
and I'm not handling it too well.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.581
Yeah, it sucks.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.210
My first breakup felt like my heart
was getting ripped out of my butt, so…

13:56.293 --> 13:59.797
And it made it even worse
that everyone was agreeing with Jay.

14:00.631 --> 14:01.757
Not everyone.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.469
Look, I was in a tough spot
'cause Jay's my best friend, but

14:06.428 --> 14:07.680
I agree with you.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.390
-You do?
-Yeah.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.476
And then Nikki chimed in
talking about living separate lives,

14:12.560 --> 14:15.938
and… I got worried I'd get
my heart ripped out of my butt again.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.524
Come on, Nate. That's just how she is.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.944
I know. I just…
I wish she wasn't always so…

14:22.653 --> 14:25.531
-God, there just isn't a word for it.
-Practical?

14:26.282 --> 14:28.367
Cool. We just invented a word!

14:30.119 --> 14:32.162
Well, thanks for telling me
all this, Nate.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.707
It's nice to know there's
another hopeless romantic out there.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.835
Yeah.
I mean, what's more powerful than love?

14:38.586 --> 14:40.170
Maybe lightning. But that's it.

14:40.254 --> 14:44.550
Right. If two people are meant to be,
then they can survive anything.

14:44.633 --> 14:45.467
Exactly.

14:46.093 --> 14:49.305
Do you know how lucky it is
to find that special person?

14:49.388 --> 14:51.056
Someone who you feel comfortable with?

14:51.140 --> 14:53.809
-And someone you can talk to.
-And everything's just easy.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.103
-Right. I mean, someone who just…
-Gets you?

14:57.187 --> 14:58.898
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.735
What the hell?!

15:04.987 --> 15:06.238
-Leia?!
-Gwen?!

15:06.322 --> 15:07.573
-Nate?!
-Gwen?!

15:13.245 --> 15:14.580
There was a fly on my junk.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.756
Oh, that Fenton makes my blood boil.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.051
But I also want to be there for Sherri.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.803
Oh, so much drama. Right, mama?

15:31.847 --> 15:32.848
Who are you?

15:34.683 --> 15:36.602
I think he's banging Gwen's mom.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.188
Yes.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.774
Yes, I am.

15:43.817 --> 15:47.279
Oh, and we had just rekindled
the flame to our relationship.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.740
Then Fenton just stomped it out.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.909
Oh, cry with me.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.002
Sorry. I can't get water from a stone.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.298
Oh, you two are no help.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.009
I miss my people.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.180
Maybe this life doesn't even matter,
you know?

16:14.056 --> 16:15.808
Maybe we're not even here.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.437
Or, no. Maybe I'm here, but you're not.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.191
Hello?

16:31.073 --> 16:31.991
Oh!

16:32.783 --> 16:33.784
Man.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.162
I just totally forgot why I was laughing.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.708
Isn't that funny?

16:42.084 --> 16:44.253
I'm losing my patience with you, man.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.547
You gotta get with her.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.674
I mean, there's nothing more beautiful

16:48.757 --> 16:51.844
than when two people
fit together perfectly like…

16:51.927 --> 16:53.470
Well, like two of these potato…

16:53.971 --> 16:55.389
How do they do this?!

16:57.016 --> 16:57.933
That's it?

16:58.434 --> 17:02.938
I have to let go of my grudge with Fenton
to fix my relationship with Sherri.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.608
Fez, what are you doing here?

17:07.484 --> 17:10.654
Donna? Oh, this is so great.
The old gang is here.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.117
Maybe we should get you some fresh air.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.827
Donna, Donna. I can't.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.912
Eric is my best friend.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.383
-How?
-I don't know.

17:32.926 --> 17:34.678
-Why?
-I do not know.

17:36.430 --> 17:39.683
He's Jay's best friend.
He's Nikki's boyfriend.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.601
He's your brother.

17:40.684 --> 17:41.685
Ugh!

17:43.604 --> 17:45.105
This is so bad.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.611
-Why are you laughing?
-Sorry.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.113
I was just thinking about
the first time we came up here.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.824
You'd never had a beer.
You'd never kissed anyone.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.327
You never stopped
talking about debate club.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.286
Oh…

18:00.037 --> 18:01.163
I was such a dork.

18:01.663 --> 18:05.125
But now look at you.
You're an agent of chaos. I love it.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.504
Gwen, what do I do now?

18:08.587 --> 18:10.380
There's nothing <i>to </i>do.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.592
You didn't kiss Nate.
You don't owe Jay anything.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.887
So, for now, you go back to Chicago,

18:16.970 --> 18:19.139
you call me every freaking day,

18:19.223 --> 18:20.974
we see each other as much as we can,

18:21.058 --> 18:24.186
and then come back next summer,
and we do it all again.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.814
I like this plan.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.483
Hang on. I got you something.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.989
Wanna break one more law before you go?

18:36.073 --> 18:38.617
At this point, why the hell not?

18:40.035 --> 18:43.413
I don't know what you said to Fenton,
but he's completely backed off.

18:43.497 --> 18:46.875
He's getting rid of that tree,
and he promised to re-carpet the bathroom.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.087
Well, I like you,

18:50.170 --> 18:53.090
so I put my ego aside
and, uh, made him a peace offering.

18:53.757 --> 18:56.677
Well, I made that birch my bitch.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.888
Guess I can take this off now.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.481
Take a picture. It'll last longer.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.825
I got that hair
from a dog groomer.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.034
I win.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.328
Hey, thanks for helping me out
with this, Fez.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.539
Most guys would have just
left me in the lurch.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.708
Oh, hearing you say that
makes me emotional.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.294
And those emotions
are going into my pants.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.504
Oh, my body's such a puzzle.

19:33.255 --> 19:36.341
Well, let's go into the bedroom
and put our pieces together.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.219
Oh, I was hoping to have sex, but…

19:39.303 --> 19:41.054
Sure, whatever.
Let's do what you wanna do.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.103
-Thanks for everything, Grandpa.
-Come here, kiddo.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.315
Loved having you around.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.316
You.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.484
But you tell your friends,

19:54.568 --> 19:57.487
the basement is off-limits
while you're gone.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.031
My turn! My turn!

19:59.114 --> 20:00.449
Oh!

20:00.532 --> 20:02.159
I love you, honey.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.745
Tell your friends
they can use the basement

20:04.828 --> 20:06.496
as much as they want while you're gone.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.916
Thanks, Grandma. I love you too.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.792
-Okay!

20:10.876 --> 20:12.419
Grandpa, it's getting tighter!

20:13.420 --> 20:14.338
Kitty!

20:14.421 --> 20:15.505
She's tappin' out.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.382
Hey.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.762
We don't have to talk about it.
It was nothing.

20:21.845 --> 20:22.846
Right.

20:23.639 --> 20:24.473
Really?

20:25.432 --> 20:28.727
-No, it was something.
-Yeah, it was definitely something.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.646
Leia!

20:31.230 --> 20:33.273
I'm so glad I caught you before you left.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.442
-Oh. Hey, bro.
-Nothing.

20:37.736 --> 20:38.695
What are you doing here?

20:38.779 --> 20:41.323
I did some soul-searching
and a crap ton of karate,

20:41.406 --> 20:43.408
and I realized I was wrong.

20:44.284 --> 20:45.702
I'm not ready to give up on us.

20:46.286 --> 20:48.664
And… I know I was a jerk,

20:48.747 --> 20:51.333
but if you give me another chance, Leia,

20:51.416 --> 20:54.086
I will spend every day
making it up to you.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.256
Jay, that's…

20:57.756 --> 20:59.174
That's so sweet, I…

21:01.426 --> 21:03.762
I'm just a little confused right now.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.515
Maybe this will help.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.229
That was a good one.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.815
Um, Gwen?

21:15.983 --> 21:17.651
She'll call you when she gets to Chicago.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.820
-Not if I call you first.
-Okay, keep it moving.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.490
Okay, Le-Le. Last goodbyes, we gotta go.

21:23.573 --> 21:26.618
-You're calling me soon as you get home.
-Oh, we have a lot to talk about.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.578
Smile!

21:30.080 --> 21:32.374
That was the last picture. My job is done.

21:35.377 --> 21:36.420
I am so sorry.

21:36.503 --> 21:37.838
-What?
-Nothing.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.841
Get in the car. Get in the car.
Get in the car. Get in the car.

21:42.759 --> 21:44.094
I'm really gonna miss her.

21:45.804 --> 21:46.722
Me too.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.142
Not.

21:52.394 --> 21:57.274
Leia, nooo!

21:57.357 --> 21:58.525
It's okay, buddy.

22:00.986 --> 22:04.990
Come back, Leia! Come baaack!
