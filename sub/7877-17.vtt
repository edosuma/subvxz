Hey, Shari and Buckle
are moving into the
neighborhood,

00:35.445 --> 00:37.946
and they've invited
us to a pool party.

00:38.014 --> 00:39.214
Wait, next weekend.

00:39.282 --> 00:40.983
Does that give
us enough time?

00:41.051 --> 00:42.518
Oh, no, Stan!
Does this mean

00:42.585 --> 00:44.586
we have to do
another one of your...

00:44.654 --> 00:47.823
"Are we good enough
to be seen in public"
Smith family fashion shows?

00:47.891 --> 00:49.058
Yes, it does.

00:49.125 --> 00:50.526
(muted techno-pop music playing)

00:50.593 --> 00:52.528
(techno-pop music continues)

00:52.595 --> 00:53.996
(turns volume down)
First up,

00:54.064 --> 00:56.632
Hayley Smith
in what appears to be

00:56.700 --> 00:59.868
the "White Trash Going Crazy
at Lake Havasu" collection.

00:59.936 --> 01:01.637
STAN:
Stop! Stop!

01:01.705 --> 01:04.206
You are not wearing
that to Buckle and
Shari's pool party.

01:04.274 --> 01:06.575
You look like you should
be holding up round cards

01:06.643 --> 01:08.477
at a dog fight in Fresno!

01:11.915 --> 01:14.383
Steve, you've known about
this party for a week,

01:14.451 --> 01:16.318
and you haven't
bulked up!

01:16.386 --> 01:19.521
You didn't make a dent
in that Russian protein
powder I gave you.

01:19.589 --> 01:21.423
Uh, I don't think
it's for people, Dad.

01:23.526 --> 01:24.693
Get out of my sight.

01:24.761 --> 01:26.829
You made me feel like
a fool for building

01:26.896 --> 01:28.263
a professional-grade
runway in my living room.

01:29.766 --> 01:32.000
You, my darling,
look perfect.

01:32.068 --> 01:33.235
Thank you.

01:33.303 --> 01:35.170
But you run your mouth
at these things.

01:35.238 --> 01:36.772
I'm giving you a
hundred-word limit.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.074
Here, I got you
this counter.
Are you serious?

01:39.142 --> 01:40.776
(clicks three times)
You've got 97 left.

01:40.844 --> 01:43.979
Stan, why is it every time
we go out in public together,

01:44.047 --> 01:46.148
you make us pass
your silly inspection.

01:46.216 --> 01:49.518
Yeah, Dad. Why do you care
so much what other people think?

01:49.586 --> 01:50.919
Because that's
all that matters!

01:50.987 --> 01:52.855
One's true value
is determined

01:52.922 --> 01:55.357
solely through
the eyes of others.

01:55.425 --> 01:57.126
That's from Genesis.

01:57.193 --> 01:58.961
Their first
album, I think.

01:59.028 --> 02:00.095
(indistinct chatter)

02:00.163 --> 02:01.663
(hooting)

02:04.200 --> 02:06.168
Welcome neighborhood, Shari.

02:06.236 --> 02:08.303
(clicking counter)
Glad not in woods
anymore?

02:08.371 --> 02:10.639
One year in that
<i>fershtunkinah</i>
cabin was enough.

02:10.707 --> 02:11.974
I was going <i>meshugie.</i>

02:12.041 --> 02:13.342
(hooting)

02:13.410 --> 02:15.277
Buckle!
Get rid of that owl!

02:15.345 --> 02:16.612
My migraine!

02:16.679 --> 02:19.381
But that owl was
my best friend for 15 years

02:19.449 --> 02:20.749
in the wilderness.

02:20.817 --> 02:22.584
It's him or me.
Who you gonna pick?

02:22.652 --> 02:23.652
Who? Who?

02:23.720 --> 02:25.020
(hooting)

02:25.088 --> 02:26.155
Stay out
of it!

02:26.222 --> 02:28.490
(soft, whiny hoot)

02:28.558 --> 02:30.759
STAN:
<i>Party's going well.</i>

02:30.827 --> 02:32.528
<i>No Smith family blunders.</i>

02:32.595 --> 02:33.562
<i>That's good.</i>

02:33.630 --> 02:35.197
<i>Mmm, great brisket.</i>

<i>Careful, now.</i>

02:36.599 --> 02:39.334
<i>96% of all party fouls</i>
<i>involve food or drink.</i>

02:39.402 --> 02:41.270
<i>Don't spill it,</i>
<i>don't choke on it.</i>

02:41.337 --> 02:42.571
How are you?!

02:42.639 --> 02:43.906
<i>You're doing great, kiddo.</i>

02:43.973 --> 02:45.307
<i>I love you so much.</i>

02:45.375 --> 02:47.643
Dad, I'm sweating like
a pig in this thing.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.412
It's humiliating.
Not to me.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.214
And show some respect--

02:52.282 --> 02:54.550
your grandmother drowned
in that bathing suit.

02:54.617 --> 02:56.819
How family?
(clicking)
No embarrassed?

02:56.886 --> 02:58.253
(clicking)
So far, so good.

02:58.321 --> 02:59.788
ROGER:
Hello, y'all!

02:59.856 --> 03:02.758
I'm Stan Smith's brother,
Appleby McFridays.

03:02.826 --> 03:04.860
Do I smell kreplach?

03:04.928 --> 03:06.762
(quietly):
Oh, no-- Roger!

03:06.830 --> 03:09.198
I helped Buckle with
his conversion to Judaism.

03:09.265 --> 03:11.133
<i>That</i> was one
stubborn foreskin.

03:11.201 --> 03:13.268
Hey, Rabbi, I got
a joke for you.

03:13.336 --> 03:15.337
Two priests are hitting
on an altar boy...

03:15.405 --> 03:17.172
Uh, hello, guy who
mistakenly believes
he's my brother.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.241
If-if you want to
hear a joke, Rabbi,

03:19.309 --> 03:20.742
I got a nice,
clean one.

03:20.810 --> 03:24.112
Um, uh, okay, what are the
three rings of marriage?

03:24.180 --> 03:25.981
The first one's
the engagement ring,

03:26.049 --> 03:27.549
the second one's
the wedding ring,

03:27.617 --> 03:29.017
and the third one...

03:29.085 --> 03:30.486
the suffer-ring.

03:30.553 --> 03:31.820
(laughter)

03:31.888 --> 03:33.422
Stan, that's
not a good joke,

03:33.490 --> 03:34.623
'cause it's not racist.

03:34.691 --> 03:35.624
Okay, here's one.

03:35.692 --> 03:37.192
So, this lazy Mexican

03:37.260 --> 03:39.328
walks into an even
lazier black guy's bar...

03:39.395 --> 03:42.297
Hey, uh, everyone, who wants to
see me cannonball into the pool?

03:42.365 --> 03:43.699
(excited shouts, cheers)

03:43.766 --> 03:46.435
A mag turninhis body into

03:46.503 --> 03:47.503
I'm in!

03:47.570 --> 03:48.770

03:48.838 --> 03:51.039

(stomach grumbling)

04:00.683 --> 04:02.618
Oh, dear, that brisket
was too greasy.

04:02.685 --> 04:04.786
Now I got to poop.

04:04.854 --> 04:06.588
Cannonball! Cannonball!

we don't judge a man

by the color of his skin,

or his religion,

09:06.469 --> 09:07.589
Excuse me friend.

09:07.599 --> 09:09.219
Where are you from exactly?

09:09.229 --> 09:11.449

09:11.459 --> 09:13.079
It's not fancy mind you.

09:13.089 --> 09:14.009
You know we don't have

09:14.019 --> 09:15.139
any swimming pools.

09:15.149 --> 09:16.669

09:20.539 --> 09:23.339
to swim, we make up for in understanding.

09:23.349 --> 09:25.069
That sounds like a perfect place

09:25.079 --> 09:26.199
for us to live.

09:26.209 --> 09:27.609
Well not much of a gay

09:27.619 --> 09:29.019
scene out back either.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.967
What a quaint town.

09:33.977 --> 09:36.297
A malt shop, an old-fashioned barber,

09:36.307 --> 09:37.127
a bakery.

09:37.137 --> 09:37.957
Yeah, yeah we get it.

09:37.967 --> 09:39.087
A little slice of heaven.

09:39.097 --> 09:40.217
Let's just hope it has what every

09:40.060 --> 09:42.095
other small town
in America has:

09:42.163 --> 09:44.097
cheap and plentiful
methamphetamines.

09:44.165 --> 09:46.099
Hardware store has
a "Help Wanted" sign.

09:46.167 --> 09:47.801
I think I <i>will</i>
inquire within.

09:47.868 --> 09:50.069
You know, gang, this
could really be a chance

09:50.137 --> 09:51.571
for us to reinvent
ourselves.

09:51.639 --> 09:55.375
Oh, yes, I'm sure life will be
very different for me here.

09:57.311 --> 09:59.779
Close enough shave
for you so far?

09:59.847 --> 10:02.949
So far. And thanks for talking
me out of that neck beard.

10:03.017 --> 10:05.251
I got to say,
I love your little town.

10:05.319 --> 10:08.054
I think my family's gonna
be happy here for generations.

10:08.122 --> 10:09.556
Do I know you?

10:09.623 --> 10:11.024
No, I don't think so.

10:11.091 --> 10:12.926
Wait. Are you
from Langley Falls?

10:13.694 --> 10:14.894
Never heard of the place.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.196
Are you sure?

10:16.263 --> 10:18.231
Because my brother lives
in Langley Falls.

10:18.299 --> 10:20.834
He sent me a newspaper
clipping, and...

10:20.901 --> 10:23.536
I swear, it had a photo of you.

10:23.604 --> 10:25.138
You did something.

10:25.206 --> 10:27.874
Hey, uh, you guys want to hear
a good racist joke?

10:27.942 --> 10:30.810
I can't remember
what it was.

10:30.878 --> 10:32.879
Eh, I threw away
the clipping.

10:32.947 --> 10:34.347
But it'll come to me.

10:34.415 --> 10:36.683
It always does.

10:38.752 --> 10:40.220
(crickets chirping)

10:41.488 --> 10:43.489
For the life of me,
Chairman Meow,

10:43.557 --> 10:46.860
I can't remember
what it was that guy did.

10:47.895 --> 10:49.395
(birds chirping)

10:50.764 --> 10:52.765
(groans)
What <i>was</i> it?

10:52.833 --> 10:55.702
It was something embarrassing...

11:00.808 --> 11:02.742
(munching)

11:02.810 --> 11:04.310
That's it!

11:04.378 --> 11:06.079
He did a cannonball
into the pool,

11:06.146 --> 11:07.614
and then he took a giant...

11:07.681 --> 11:08.815
(gasps)

11:08.883 --> 11:11.117
You had to remember.

11:11.185 --> 11:13.086
Come on.

11:13.153 --> 11:16.356
You're really gonna kill me
just 'cause I know your secret?

11:16.423 --> 11:19.525
So, this place isn't
going to work out.

11:19.593 --> 11:22.495
(tires squealing)

11:22.563 --> 11:25.164
(foghorn blowing)

11:25.232 --> 11:27.800
(car horns honking)

11:27.868 --> 11:29.302
This is perfect.

11:29.370 --> 11:31.771
We're living above a fish market
in Little Romania.

11:31.839 --> 11:34.607
Nobody here has any connection
to Langley Falls.

11:34.675 --> 11:36.409
Wish we weren't
sharing the apartment

11:36.477 --> 11:38.978
with 14 members of
the Bombescu family.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.246
(groans)

11:40.314 --> 11:41.748
13.

11:41.815 --> 11:43.416
(crying)
Back to 14.

11:43.484 --> 11:45.752
Circle of life,
beautiful thing.

11:45.819 --> 11:47.520
See? We're safe here.

11:47.588 --> 11:49.555
We've outrun my shame
for good.

11:49.623 --> 11:52.525
He wants me
to play with him.

11:52.593 --> 11:54.427
(laughing)

11:57.298 --> 12:00.066
Somebody was videotaping?

12:00.134 --> 12:01.567
(laughter)

12:01.635 --> 12:02.735
Oh, my God!

12:02.803 --> 12:05.004
Stan Smith just made a BM!

12:06.807 --> 12:08.207
You can't hit me.

12:08.275 --> 12:09.876
I'm a new mother.

12:09.944 --> 12:12.645
(tires squealing)

12:12.713 --> 12:16.015
We have to move somewhere
they don't have the Internet.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.918
(tribal chanting)

12:21.355 --> 12:23.222
(both laughing)

12:25.759 --> 12:28.661
(laughter)

12:28.729 --> 12:30.496
♪ ♪

12:33.667 --> 12:36.102
(tribesmen laughing)

12:39.373 --> 12:42.642
(man speaking Spanish
over P.A. system)

12:42.710 --> 12:44.844
Wait. Where's
your ticket?

12:44.912 --> 12:46.913
I've realized
I can't outrun this thing.

12:46.981 --> 12:50.249
I'm sending you back without me
so you can lead normal lives.

12:50.317 --> 12:52.485
What? We don't
want to go back
without you.

12:52.553 --> 12:55.154
Trust me. This will
be better for all of us.

12:55.222 --> 12:57.323
Guess that makes me
the man of the house.

12:57.391 --> 12:58.691
There's gonna
be some changes.

12:58.759 --> 13:00.093
Steve, kiss me
on the mouth.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.627
But what will you do?

13:01.695 --> 13:03.229
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be fine.

13:03.297 --> 13:05.465
I'm gonna have a drink
at the airport bar.

13:05.532 --> 13:07.333
Then I'm going
to blow my brains out.

13:07.401 --> 13:08.634
Don't tell the kids.

13:08.702 --> 13:10.336
Stan, the kids
know you drink.

13:10.404 --> 13:14.040
(sighs) Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm not gonna miss that.

13:15.542 --> 13:16.909
NEWSCASTER (with British
accent): President Obama visited

13:16.977 --> 13:18.411
the U.N. today where he received

13:18.479 --> 13:20.246
a five-hour standing ovation.

13:20.314 --> 13:22.749
That Obama sure
has changed things.

13:22.816 --> 13:24.117
What do you mean?

13:24.184 --> 13:26.386
Well, the United States
was the laughingstock

13:26.453 --> 13:28.488
of the world until
Obama came along.

13:28.555 --> 13:30.423
Yeah, sure, whatever.

13:33.894 --> 13:35.895
I mean, the
United States

13:35.963 --> 13:38.064
has done some pretty
shameful things.

13:38.132 --> 13:41.601
Just this 20-gauge and, uh,
one of these Toblerones.

13:42.903 --> 13:44.871
But then Obama
comes along,

13:44.938 --> 13:47.373
and he makes
it all better.

13:47.441 --> 13:49.308
Uh, you may want
to stand back.

13:49.376 --> 13:50.777
Brain matter?

13:50.844 --> 13:53.413
I mean, if Obama can
make America look good

13:53.480 --> 13:55.815
after all the embarrassing
crap it's pulled,

13:55.883 --> 13:57.950
then he can make
anything look good.

13:58.018 --> 14:00.086
My God.

14:00.154 --> 14:01.320
That's it!

14:02.489 --> 14:04.424
Anyway, as you know,

14:04.491 --> 14:07.727
Lima has a booming industry
of blind male prostitutes,

14:07.795 --> 14:09.796
of which I am widely known

14:09.863 --> 14:13.032
as the second-most disease-free.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.401
Señor?

14:15.469 --> 14:17.303
(sighs and mumbles)

14:19.173 --> 14:20.440
(gun fires)
(yells)

14:25.179 --> 14:26.312
(panting): We can
be together again.

14:26.380 --> 14:27.547
I've got a plan.

14:27.614 --> 14:29.348
Does that plan include

14:29.416 --> 14:31.150
explaining
why a footless blind man

14:31.218 --> 14:34.087
is giving an expert bajowski
to our baggage handler?

14:34.154 --> 14:35.988
Admire the skills!

14:36.056 --> 14:38.357
No, listen, I'm a
laughingstock, right?

14:38.425 --> 14:40.359
Well, there's one
man who's so beloved

14:40.427 --> 14:43.429
that if he did what I did,
he'd actually make it cool.

14:43.497 --> 14:44.964
What are you talking about?

14:45.032 --> 14:47.266
It's simple. We've just got to
get President Obama

14:47.334 --> 14:49.135
to make a boom-boom in a pool!

14:49.203 --> 14:50.470
I don't know.

14:50.537 --> 14:52.338
Obama may be black,
but I bet

14:52.406 --> 14:54.440
he keeps his butt clenched
like he's white.

14:54.508 --> 14:56.275
Huh. That's, that's from
my stand-up routine.

14:56.343 --> 14:57.743
Check it out.

14:57.811 --> 15:00.246
You ever notice
when a black man
poops in the pool,

15:00.314 --> 15:01.747
he's, like,
"Yo, check it!"

15:01.815 --> 15:04.484
But then, when
a white guy poops
in a pool, he's, all,

15:04.551 --> 15:06.486
"Oh, my, I'm defecating
in the swimming
receptacle."

15:10.828 --> 15:12.729
Stan, we'll never even
get close to Obama.

15:12.797 --> 15:14.431
This plan is crazy.

15:14.498 --> 15:17.267
Look, if we can just get
Obama to do what I did,

15:17.334 --> 15:18.902
then no one can
tease me anymore.

15:18.969 --> 15:21.037
Then we can move
back home together.

15:21.105 --> 15:23.339
White Mission
Control be, all,

15:23.407 --> 15:25.508
"Uh, we are clear
to initiate
landing sequence

15:25.576 --> 15:27.544
for Space Shuttle
Atlantis."

15:27.611 --> 15:29.179
But Black Mission
Control be, all,

15:29.246 --> 15:30.513
"Get out
of the way!

15:30.581 --> 15:32.048
Here comes
the shuuutttle!"

15:32.116 --> 15:33.149
(pushing
stewardess button)

15:35.352 --> 15:37.887
This roach coach will serve
as our base of operations

15:37.955 --> 15:40.757
as we carry out
Operation Pinch a Loaf.

15:40.825 --> 15:43.493
I need two breakfast burritos
and a side of refried beans.

15:43.561 --> 15:45.829
Two BBs and a side
of fart paste coming up.

15:45.896 --> 15:47.297
The plan is simple.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.432
We'll renovate
a rundown community pool.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.568
Then we'll have
a grand opening ceremony,

15:51.635 --> 15:53.436
convince Obama
to swim the inaugural lap,

15:53.504 --> 15:55.738
and then get him
to drop a presidential deuce.

15:55.806 --> 15:57.807
How are we going
to get to Obama?

15:57.875 --> 16:00.310
First step-- one of us
is going to make friends

16:00.377 --> 16:02.011
with his two
adorable daughters.

16:02.079 --> 16:03.313
But they go to one

16:03.380 --> 16:05.515
of the most exclusive
private schools in D.C.

16:05.583 --> 16:08.151
How are we even
going to get close?

16:08.219 --> 16:10.153
We're a
lesbian couple.

16:10.221 --> 16:12.288
We adopted our daughter
from an orphanage in Somalia.

16:12.356 --> 16:14.057
My name is Winfrey.

16:14.124 --> 16:15.658
Full scholarship.

16:18.762 --> 16:20.430
Hi. The name's
Winfrey.

16:20.498 --> 16:22.365
I like Jo' Bros,
Mi Psy, Gaga,

16:22.433 --> 16:25.068
Kay Pay, FiFi, Schwi Schwi
and the Flack Eye Fleas.

16:25.135 --> 16:26.436
Yeah, we
fray frays now.

16:26.504 --> 16:27.804
We best fray frays.

16:27.872 --> 16:29.405
Let's have a play date--
your house.

16:32.109 --> 16:33.610
Madam First Lady,

16:33.677 --> 16:37.547
we are so honored to be here
as lesbians of no color.

16:37.615 --> 16:39.816
Well, your daughter
is just darling.

16:39.884 --> 16:41.618
Barack and I are so pleased

16:41.685 --> 16:43.319
the girls and Winfrey
have hit it off.

16:43.387 --> 16:44.721
Okay, according
to the map,

16:44.788 --> 16:47.924
this is where Amy Carter buried
all of her (bleep).

16:47.992 --> 16:50.527
So it would really mean
a lot to the community

16:50.594 --> 16:53.062
if the president would come
and take the inaugural lap.

16:53.130 --> 16:54.998
I will make sure he's there.

16:58.369 --> 16:59.903
No fair.

16:59.970 --> 17:02.605
Everybody has a role in
this plan except for me.

17:02.673 --> 17:04.307
I could live to be a hundred

17:04.375 --> 17:06.776
and never figure out
how to fold a burrito.

17:06.844 --> 17:08.310
Okay, let me
ask you this.

17:08.378 --> 17:10.213
You can lead a
president to water,

17:10.281 --> 17:12.515
but how will you
make him Smith in it?

17:12.583 --> 17:14.017
(toilet flushing)

17:14.084 --> 17:16.719
Klaus, I'd like you
to meet Dr. Olestra Montezuma,

17:16.787 --> 17:19.756
Mexico's leading authority
on Quantum Fecal Theory.

17:19.823 --> 17:22.959
Dr. Montezuma is developing
a fast-acting laxative

17:23.027 --> 17:24.394
for our operation.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.429
He was the mastermind
behind Tijuana.

17:26.497 --> 17:29.432
I've never been, but I've
heard terrible things.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.934
Congratulations,
Doctor.

17:31.001 --> 17:32.569
Let's get started.

17:32.636 --> 17:34.537
First, I will show you
some samples.

17:34.605 --> 17:36.439
Manuel, bring in the jars.

17:36.507 --> 17:38.508
I need more
time, <i>jefe.</i>

17:38.576 --> 17:41.177
Well, bring whatever you have.

17:41.245 --> 17:43.146
It will just be a minute.

17:46.317 --> 17:47.650
Is everybody in position?

17:47.718 --> 17:48.651
Check.
Yeah.

17:48.719 --> 17:49.652
Ready, Dad.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.821
Inserting laxative

17:51.889 --> 17:53.990
into hot dog A.

17:54.058 --> 17:56.759
Inserting hot dog B
into my A.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.661
(cheering)

17:58.729 --> 17:59.596
Here comes the limo!

17:59.663 --> 18:02.332
(cheering)

18:02.399 --> 18:04.267
STAN:
Roger, go, go!

18:04.335 --> 18:05.702
(cheering)

18:05.769 --> 18:07.136
Hello, Mr.
President.

18:07.204 --> 18:09.238
I made a hot dog
just for you.

18:09.306 --> 18:11.140
Oh, aren't you cute.

18:11.208 --> 18:12.909
But I don't eat
before I swim.

18:12.977 --> 18:14.877
Francine, initiate backup plan!

18:14.945 --> 18:17.580
Repeat, put on the laxative
glove and shake Obama's hand.

18:17.648 --> 18:19.382
He'll absorb it
through his skin.

18:19.450 --> 18:21.351
(cheering)

18:21.418 --> 18:24.220
Mr. President, we are so
thrilled that you're here.

18:33.097 --> 18:34.364
No!

18:34.431 --> 18:35.598
(cheering)

18:35.666 --> 18:37.533
All right, let's swim.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.439
That's it.

18:43.507 --> 18:44.941
The operation's a failure.

18:45.009 --> 18:46.175
Good-bye, family.

18:46.243 --> 18:48.478
You will never see
or hear from me again.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.380
(cheering)

18:54.385 --> 18:55.551
We've got to
do something.

18:55.619 --> 18:56.819
I'm on it.

19:12.236 --> 19:13.403
(grunts)

19:15.072 --> 19:18.007
(in slow motion):
Fish!

19:21.545 --> 19:22.845
(gasping)

19:26.216 --> 19:27.517
Klaus!
Klaus!
Klaus!

19:28.786 --> 19:30.386
No! My plan!

19:31.522 --> 19:33.189
Now hang on.

19:33.257 --> 19:35.091
This man looks
familiar to me.

19:36.260 --> 19:37.994
Ha! It is!

19:38.062 --> 19:40.797
Now, this man's poopy exploits
have brought me many hours

19:40.864 --> 19:42.465
of online joy.

19:42.533 --> 19:45.501
Now, what exactly
were you trying to
accomplish here,

19:45.569 --> 19:47.170
Mr. Funny
Poopy Man?

19:47.237 --> 19:48.471
Mr. President,
I'm sorry.

19:48.539 --> 19:50.807
I just thought
if you fudged in the pool,

19:50.874 --> 19:53.042
maybe people would stop
laughing at me.

19:53.110 --> 19:55.945
Oh, man, you can't
worry about what other
people think of you.

19:56.013 --> 19:58.614
Do you know how mad
the black community gets at me

19:58.682 --> 20:00.283
because I don't smoke menthols?

20:00.350 --> 20:03.086
But it doesn't affect me,
because I don't let it.

20:03.153 --> 20:05.121
But sir,
I'm a laughingstock.

20:05.189 --> 20:07.256
Look, Poopy Man,

20:07.324 --> 20:10.326
if you refuse to care
what people think,

20:10.394 --> 20:12.095
then their laughter
cannot hurt you.

20:12.162 --> 20:14.964
Just ignore them.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.366
Oh, terrific.

20:17.434 --> 20:19.268
It looks like Michelle
is gonna delight us

20:19.336 --> 20:20.603
with one of her
famous cannonballs.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.708
(chanting):
Cannon...
ball!

20:25.776 --> 20:27.110
Cannon... ball!

20:27.177 --> 20:30.580
CROWD:
Cannonball! Cannonball!

20:30.647 --> 20:32.215
Cannonball!

20:32.282 --> 20:34.417
Cannonball! Cannonball!

20:34.485 --> 20:36.219
Cannonball...!

20:36.286 --> 20:38.020
I haven't jumped yet.

20:38.088 --> 20:39.522
I imagined the whole thing.

20:39.590 --> 20:41.124
Cannonball...!

20:41.191 --> 20:42.658
(stomach gurgling)

20:42.726 --> 20:45.261
Their laughter can't hurt me
if I don't let it.

20:45.329 --> 20:48.531
Extended Fantasy-Sequence Obama
made me realize that.

20:48.599 --> 20:50.299
Cannonball!
(sighs)

20:50.367 --> 20:52.201
Cannonball!

20:55.372 --> 20:58.608
(uproarious, mocking laughter)

20:58.675 --> 21:00.643
(door slams, laughter mutes)
