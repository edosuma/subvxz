tell a stranger

I'm rooting for Girls5eva

of a guy I once dated.

is Content Crib,

SUNY Steez Castle, so...

09:49.839 --> 09:52.676
Now you're getting it.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.428
* Now head up the aisles *

09:57.013 --> 09:59.724
- If I were a betting man--
and I am, it's a problem--

09:59.766 --> 10:01.601
I'd get your passports
in order.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.687
- Whoo!
- Ahh!

10:03.728 --> 10:04.979
- Shit!
- [clears throat]

10:05.021 --> 10:07.148
But seriously,
who wants to take that bet?

10:07.190 --> 10:08.858
I'm in the hole
after the Rangers game,

10:08.900 --> 10:10.360
and I don't even know
what sport they do.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.153
- Whoo!

10:12.195 --> 10:13.988
- Sharp cheddar,
this is getting real.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.824
- To tour mode!
- Whoo!

10:15.865 --> 10:17.784
- Whoo! [laughs]
- Whoo!

10:17.826 --> 10:19.953
- Dawn, you're hesitating.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.706
[together]
You're pregnant?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.124
- Jesus.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.714
- Yes, I'm pregnant.
- Ah!

10:30.755 --> 10:32.882
I'm handling the quizzes
at the shower.

10:32.924 --> 10:34.217
- Planned?

10:34.259 --> 10:35.468
- I don't really want
to get into it,

10:35.510 --> 10:37.512
but one day I was desperate
for a hair tie,

10:37.554 --> 10:39.097
and my NuvaRing was
right there, so...

10:39.139 --> 10:40.682
[cell phone buzzes]

10:40.724 --> 10:42.183
I mean,
I know it's a curveball,

10:42.225 --> 10:44.227
but I think we can make it work
as long as we--

10:44.269 --> 10:48.106
- Honey, do you really think
a grueling tour is a good idea?

10:48.148 --> 10:51.609
- Well, I did tons of physical
stuff when I was pregnant.

10:51.651 --> 10:56.031
You know, Zumba, and Peloton,
and I hit two mail trucks.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.241
Why do they stop all the time?
Just drive!

10:58.283 --> 11:02.620
- It's just, my aunt Ronnie
was an older pregnant lady,

11:02.662 --> 11:05.415
and she overexerted herself,

11:05.457 --> 11:07.500
and her baby grew up
to be a Disney adult.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.586
A Disney adult, Dawn.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.172
- [scoffs]
Are you--

11:12.213 --> 11:13.965
are you saying I shouldn't go?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.175
- What the fuzz, Wick?

11:15.216 --> 11:16.509
You trying to kick her out

11:16.551 --> 11:18.887
because she took one solo
in the album?

11:18.928 --> 11:20.513
- No!

11:20.555 --> 11:23.683
I'm just looking out
for my friend.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.477
- Am I being reckless?

11:25.518 --> 11:28.438
- We'd understand if you wanted
to stay local.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.732
- Shut your butts!
Stevia's going live.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.943
- Hey, guys.
- Yo, yo, did someone say fam?

11:33.985 --> 11:35.487
- No.
- 'Cause I'm fam.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.280
And I'm super stoked to be here
when my baby girl opens up

11:37.322 --> 11:40.158
her Hype House acceptance DMs.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.243
- You have keto breath.
- Truth.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.621
Now, which hat is it gonna be?

11:44.662 --> 11:47.123
- Let's see.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.293
[tense music]

11:50.335 --> 11:52.003
Oh, my God.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.339
Nowhere?
- Not even Cringe Palace?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.217
Isn't there some kind
of waitlist

11:57.258 --> 11:59.344
in case a bro-bro
gets canceled, y'all?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.346
- Oh, sorry, Sum.
- It's probably for the best.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.639
[bright note]
[car honks]

12:02.681 --> 12:04.808
- Well, everything's
in the right spot.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.351
You have one baby,

12:06.393 --> 12:09.938
and one little LEGO man hat
in the intestinal tract.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.440
But that will disintegrate
over time.

12:12.482 --> 12:15.485
- I do have some
lifestyle questions.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.570
- Mm-hmm?
- Um...

12:17.612 --> 12:20.990
Can I run in heels?
And what about thrusting?

12:21.032 --> 12:22.575
Secondhand stage fog?

12:22.617 --> 12:25.036
Wh-what about
glitter inhalation?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.204
- Oh, I see what
you're getting at.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.248
Yes, yes,
you can play a prostitute

12:28.289 --> 12:30.375
in an Italian art film.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.837
- No, it's just, there's
a "Danger Geriatric" stamp

12:33.878 --> 12:35.714
on my file,
and I read some stuff

12:35.755 --> 12:37.132
comparing my eggs to the kind

12:37.173 --> 12:39.509
that an old man pulls loose
from a corduroy pocket.

12:39.551 --> 12:42.137
- Ugh, a lot of that language
is vestigial

12:42.178 --> 12:44.097
from when women over 35
were categorized

12:44.139 --> 12:46.391
as "medically gross."

12:46.433 --> 12:48.268
Don't worry.
How old are you?

12:48.309 --> 12:49.310
- I'm 40.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.396
- Oh, you're a widdle baby.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.605
You are...

12:54.482 --> 12:55.817
Yep.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.153
Ms. Solano, you are
the youngest pregnant woman

12:58.194 --> 12:59.779
in our entire system.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.281
- How is that even possible?

13:01.322 --> 13:03.241
- It's New York City.
[chuckles]

13:03.283 --> 13:05.744
The average 38 year old
only owns a laptop

13:05.785 --> 13:08.246
and two Amy's frozen burritos.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.206
Everybody waits here.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.292
- Really?
- Really.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.086
- Shit, I'm down to one.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.881
[tense music]

13:17.922 --> 13:19.341
- Mm-hmm.
- But her eyebrow game

13:19.382 --> 13:21.426
can definitely come up.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.261
- What if I donate
an Instagram wall

13:23.303 --> 13:25.430
with "swole" written
in AstroTurf?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.723
- Well, we'll get her
a STEM tutor--

13:26.765 --> 13:28.600
you know, selfies, TikToks,
emojis, and memes?

13:28.641 --> 13:29.893
- Mm-hmm.
- Dang it!

13:29.934 --> 13:32.020
- Dang it to fuck!
[gasps] Kev.

13:32.062 --> 13:34.272
- What did you just say?
- Nothing.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.774
I don't even know that word.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.610
- [sighs]
Okay, Kev, look.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.905
I know that Stevia
is incredibly disappointed.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.031
- What about
Larry's hype house?

13:43.073 --> 13:44.616
- What?
- Or an evangelical birthright

13:44.657 --> 13:46.117
where she visits the condo
in Orlando

13:46.159 --> 13:47.327
where Jesus was born?

13:47.369 --> 13:49.788
- Stop it!
Stevia can just stay here.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.331
- No, you stop it!

13:51.373 --> 13:52.791
I am not going
to be a single dad.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.042
- Oh!

13:54.084 --> 13:55.460
- I've only ever been
a weekend dad.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.754
What do you do on a Wednesday?
Is that when she eats?

13:57.796 --> 14:01.174
- She eats all the days!
- Oh, slow down, Sum!

14:01.216 --> 14:04.344
I am not a natural caretaker.
All my crabs died.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.596
Their chalky white paste
is on my hands.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.306
Crabs don't have
traditional blood.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.392
I can't take this on.
I'm dealing with a lot!

14:10.433 --> 14:12.519
Realtor!

14:12.560 --> 14:15.647
I live in a basement,
and I'm afraid of the dryer.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.401
I'm sorry, ex-babe.
You can't go on tour, ex-babe.

and I wanna learn saxophone.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.855
- But...

15:38.897 --> 15:41.733
what if we're in France
and your baby gets "Taken"?

15:41.775 --> 15:43.985
Scott doesn't have the skills
for that, Dawn.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.236
You think
he's gonna get it back

15:45.278 --> 15:47.155
by rearranging books by color?

15:47.197 --> 15:48.698
- Wickie,
what is wrong with you?

15:48.740 --> 15:52.369
- And, Gloria, you just
rekindled your relationship

15:52.410 --> 15:54.579
with the luminous
and irreplaceable Cindy.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.456
- Caroline.
- Well, you abandon her,

15:56.498 --> 15:58.500
and the nightmare starts.

15:58.541 --> 16:02.337
Mark my words.
Cynthia will stray.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.464
She's got the stubby thumbs
of a serial cheater.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.299
- You just called her luminous.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.718
- I know that camp doesn't
start till July.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.804
I was just wondering
if maybe there was

16:10.845 --> 16:11.971
an off-season groundskeeper.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.640
- And, Summer,

16:13.682 --> 16:15.892
you can't leave Stevia
with Kev!

16:15.934 --> 16:17.727
She'll kill him!

16:17.769 --> 16:19.604
- What the hell is going on
with you?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.940
- Why are you trying
to kill the tour?

Okay?
I'm in love.

16:28.530 --> 16:32.909
I'm in love--I'm in love
with the stupid lunch lord.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.202
- Who?
[table rattles]

16:34.244 --> 16:35.537
- Oh.
- Oh, my God, he's--

16:35.578 --> 16:38.456
he's cute, and he's honest...
[laughs]

16:38.498 --> 16:40.500
And I can't stop thinking
about him

16:40.542 --> 16:42.794
even though he owns zero planes
and a mug that says,

16:42.836 --> 16:45.296
"Keep calm
and hate the Dodgers."

16:45.338 --> 16:47.298
He even likes my busted foot.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.968
- Eww.
But is he, like, too into it?

16:50.010 --> 16:51.136
- No, he's only fine with it.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.971
It's normal levels
of acceptance.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.306
I blame you for this!

16:55.348 --> 16:58.935
You did this to me.
You made me evolve.

[doorbell chimes]

17:11.906 --> 17:13.992
- Wickie is right.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.661
I can't leave Stevia with Kev.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.164
And my parents can't watch her
because they're

17:19.205 --> 17:20.999
"building churches in Haiti."

17:21.041 --> 17:25.253
But this bible quote
they just posted is geotagged

17:25.295 --> 17:31.259
at the "Dirty Fox Casino and
Clothing-Optional Waterpark."

17:31.301 --> 17:33.845
- Ooh, they're backsliding.
- Yeah.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.180
Ugh!

17:35.221 --> 17:39.017
How am I the grown-up
in my world?

17:39.059 --> 17:40.935
Oh, wait, honey.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.270
Could you watch Stevia?

17:42.312 --> 17:44.022
- I'm going on the tour
with you.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.482
- Ugh, right.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.900
- The tour's gonna
be a nightmare.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.068
Wickie's right.

17:48.109 --> 17:50.862
I'd leave,
Caroline would feel neglected,

17:50.904 --> 17:52.697
so she goes
and gets drunk one night,

17:52.739 --> 17:54.866
and she slips up,
and then I'm devastated.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.910
- Oh.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.704
- And then I have
guilt-free permission

17:59.746 --> 18:03.375
to explore everything
that's out there for me.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.377
Why aren't you doing
a proud face?

18:05.418 --> 18:08.213
- Nothing proud is happening.
- Oh.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.632
You're the one that's always
trying to get me to branch out.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.385
I've only been with one woman
my whole life.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.553
- Well, you're treating
our tour

18:15.595 --> 18:18.390
the same way that Kev
treated Tampa.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.892
You get to do your thang,
but it's not fair

18:20.934 --> 18:23.895
to the luminous woman
waiting for you back home.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.440
Gloria, I wasted years
of my life just sitting

18:27.482 --> 18:32.612
in a kitchen staring
at, like, cups.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.824
- No, all I want to do is hold
on to the relationship

18:35.865 --> 18:38.451
that I cherish
but experience the things

18:38.493 --> 18:41.246
I never got to so I'll know
that she's the right one.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.039
- That's called cheating.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.458
- I wonder if the tour would go
by that Dirty Fox Waterpark.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.210
- Oh, good Lord.

18:47.252 --> 18:51.256
* *

18:51.297 --> 18:53.091
- It started that way.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.926
- What started what way?

18:54.968 --> 18:57.595
I was just putting up
an Ansel Adams poster

18:57.637 --> 19:00.056
of a cool mountain.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.933
- Sheawn Last Name Unknown,

19:01.975 --> 19:04.644
if we get this tour,
part of me doesn't want to go,

19:04.686 --> 19:07.105
and it's not because
I'm seeking comfort

19:07.147 --> 19:08.857
or I'm Ryan Salging.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.734
It's because I want
to be with you.

19:10.775 --> 19:14.070
And I think you
and I could maybe work

19:14.112 --> 19:15.196
because Sandra Bullock's

19:15.238 --> 19:17.574
with a children's
birthday photographer.

19:20.368 --> 19:23.163
- I like you, too, Wickie.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.789
But you're a star,

19:24.831 --> 19:29.586
like Vin Diesel
or the Monopoly top hat.

19:29.627 --> 19:32.088
And I'd be mad if you didn't go

19:32.130 --> 19:33.673
'cause I would never
want to be that guy

19:33.715 --> 19:35.759
to piss out your light.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.093
- Aww.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.264
Can I chaperone the dance
with you?

19:41.306 --> 19:43.141
- Okay.

19:43.183 --> 19:46.728
So you ready to be seen
in public with a lunch lord?

19:46.770 --> 19:49.981
Right on!
[both laugh]

19:50.023 --> 19:51.399
Ooh, baby.

19:51.441 --> 19:55.320
* *

19:55.362 --> 19:57.655
- You're an actual lord?

19:57.697 --> 20:00.408
The universe is rewarding me
for being pure of heart

20:00.450 --> 20:03.620
and for falling
for a village normling.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.497
- [laughs]
Nah.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.625
I did three tours in Iraq.
- Oh.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.002
Okay!
- It was traumatizing.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.421
- My attacks on you all
yesterday were P-BAGS.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.590
Pew, pew, pew, et cetera.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.008
I'm in for the tour.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.218
- Hey, Tate.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.387
- I've got some VIBs
who would like a word.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.930
- [gasps]

20:22.889 --> 20:25.475
both: * Girls5eva *
- Oh, my God! [laughs]

20:25.517 --> 20:26.851
- Drew and Jonathan.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.353
- Sorry we couldn't
make the show.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.980
We do like 800 episodes
of "Property Brothers" a year,

20:31.022 --> 20:32.357
and we're in the middle
of Toronto Week.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.317
- Ooh, sounds exotic!

20:34.359 --> 20:37.070
- But we watched the footage.
You did an amazing job.

20:37.112 --> 20:38.113
- Thank you.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.407
- Thank you,
Mr. and Mr. Property.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.992
- It's just...
[drill whirring]

20:43.034 --> 20:44.703
Actually, we're in
the dream-making business.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.121
Tate, tell them
they didn't get the tour.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.456
[dramatic flourish]
- You didn't get the tour.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.458
[somber music]

20:50.500 --> 20:51.626
[mouthing]

20:55.171 --> 20:57.132
[quirky music]

20:57.173 --> 20:58.800
- We didn't get it?

20:58.842 --> 21:00.468
- See, Joel, that's the face

21:00.510 --> 21:02.387
that the Ballmores should make
when I'm like,

21:02.429 --> 21:05.056
"But we're not done.
Yep, a craft room for Mom."

21:05.098 --> 21:07.142
- Ugh, who would even
want that?

21:07.183 --> 21:08.977
- This is absurd.

21:09.019 --> 21:11.980
We should be getting the good
news, not the Ballmores.

21:12.022 --> 21:14.315
- We put our blood, sweat,
and knees into this album.

21:14.357 --> 21:15.442
- Yeah.
- I know,

21:15.483 --> 21:17.444
but life isn't a wish machine.

21:17.485 --> 21:20.822
You don't always get to do
the exact thing you're best at.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.116
For me, it's this.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.702
Sharing screen...
[dramatic music]

21:25.744 --> 21:27.328
- Fight reel?

21:27.370 --> 21:30.498
- [grunting]

21:30.540 --> 21:37.714
* *

21:39.132 --> 21:40.342
- What?

21:40.383 --> 21:47.557
* *

21:48.975 --> 21:50.518
[all gasp]

21:50.560 --> 21:52.771
- Are you watching in awe?

21:52.812 --> 21:54.689
Your faces are too small.
I can't tell.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.024
[gunshots]
Ugh, I hate Zoom.

21:56.066 --> 21:58.234
- You should have been
Jack Ryan, sir.

21:58.276 --> 22:00.528
- I know.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.280
- Oh, my God.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.824
Okay, I did not wanna say this
over there,

22:04.866 --> 22:07.160
but which one was cuter?

22:07.202 --> 22:08.244
- How'd this happen?

22:08.286 --> 22:10.747
We were so much better
than Co-Z Boi.

22:10.789 --> 22:12.332
- Yeah, it's ageism.

22:12.374 --> 22:13.917
They don't want to deal
with grown-ass,

22:13.958 --> 22:16.211
informed women with opinions.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.253
- Really?

22:17.295 --> 22:19.255
Name the governor
of New York, Dawn.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.549
- Garby...Karbondo.

22:21.591 --> 22:23.093
- I'm sorry I doubted you.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.928
- Look, guys.

22:24.969 --> 22:27.972
I know that this sucks,
but maybe it is for the best.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.391
I don't have anyone
to watch Stevia.

22:29.432 --> 22:30.600
Wickie is in love.

22:30.642 --> 22:33.144
Dawn could only crowd-surf
on her side.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.021
- Yeah, I mean,
it's not like it's '99

22:35.063 --> 22:37.399
where all we had to think about
was how many thongs to pack.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.858
- 47.
- Nope.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.319
None of this
is sitting right with me.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.737
We deserve this tour.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.948
And I've watched enough
true crime to know

22:44.989 --> 22:46.700
when there's more to a story.

22:46.741 --> 22:47.784
- Let it go, Gloria.

22:47.826 --> 22:49.828
- Well, letting go
is not my brand.

22:50.662 --> 22:52.247
I know that building.

22:52.288 --> 22:55.125
Holy shit, they're shooting
New York for Toronto!

22:55.166 --> 22:57.252
- It rarely goes
that direction.

22:59.587 --> 23:00.839
[bright music]

23:00.880 --> 23:02.716
- With the money we saved
on the backsplash...

23:02.757 --> 23:05.051
- This reno came in
$40 under budget.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.846
- Money was super important
to our budget.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.264
- They're they are!
- Is this even our house?

23:09.305 --> 23:10.432
- Hey!

23:10.473 --> 23:12.767
Why didn't Girls5eva
get the opener gig?

23:12.809 --> 23:14.436
- Sorry, we're in the middle--
- Sexism, ageism?

23:14.477 --> 23:16.855
Which ism ism it?

23:16.896 --> 23:18.481
- Co-Z Boi was just
a better fit.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.108
- How?
People walked out.

23:20.150 --> 23:22.569
- I'm sorry, but this just
isn't the right time, okay?

23:22.610 --> 23:24.070
Can we just get a little B-roll
of me and the wallpaper--

23:24.112 --> 23:26.197
- I'm not leaving.
- Come on.

23:26.239 --> 23:29.325
- Look, the one with the beard,
we deserve the truth.

23:31.036 --> 23:33.288
And I'm willing
to fight you for it.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.623
- Are you kidding?
- Do it, bitch.

23:35.665 --> 23:38.626
[tense music]

23:38.668 --> 23:39.919
* *

23:39.961 --> 23:42.047
- [grunts]
- Come on.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.008
- [gasps]

23:45.050 --> 23:46.217
- Ah!

23:46.259 --> 23:47.927
- Yeah.
- Oh! Who is that?

23:47.969 --> 23:49.637
- Come on.
Come at me!

23:49.679 --> 23:51.097
Ah!

23:53.350 --> 23:54.476
- Do you yield?

23:54.517 --> 23:57.437
- Eat shit, modern Jesus!

23:57.479 --> 23:58.897
[screams]

24:00.398 --> 24:02.359
Asshole!
- Not my cabinet!

24:02.400 --> 24:03.443
- Ah!

24:09.366 --> 24:11.159
[growls]
- [shouts]

24:11.201 --> 24:12.410
- Ah!

24:12.452 --> 24:14.245
- Come on!

24:16.706 --> 24:17.957
- My Pela windows!
- [laughs]

24:20.794 --> 24:23.129
- Boom in the shot!

24:23.171 --> 24:24.381
- Oh, God.
- Come on!

24:25.256 --> 24:26.549
[yelps]

24:26.591 --> 24:27.550
That all you got?

24:27.592 --> 24:28.885
[both grunting]

24:28.927 --> 24:30.470
Right in the brothers!

24:30.512 --> 24:32.305
- [grunts]
- Oh.

24:32.347 --> 24:34.849
- That's titanium,
motherfucker.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.518
[dramatic music]

24:36.559 --> 24:37.936
[laughs]

24:37.977 --> 24:42.857
* *

24:42.899 --> 24:44.859
- Kill him.
Do it, please.

24:44.901 --> 24:46.903
- Jesus.
- Okay, okay!

24:46.945 --> 24:48.279
It was an ism!

24:48.321 --> 24:49.989
Moneyism.
- You mean capitalism?

24:50.031 --> 24:52.450
- Shut up, Jonathan!

24:52.492 --> 24:55.537
Look, the opener has a function
up there, to die.

24:55.578 --> 24:57.247
- What?

25:00.750 --> 25:03.962
- It's so people hit up
concessions and buy chicken,

25:04.004 --> 25:05.755
alcohol,
and our new scented hammers.

25:05.797 --> 25:08.758
- Alcohol and hammers--
admittedly not the best combo.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.218
Look, you were great.

25:10.260 --> 25:12.512
It's just that this is
a business venture for us.

25:12.554 --> 25:15.348
- So we lost because
people stayed and liked it?

25:15.390 --> 25:16.599
- Especially the moms.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.143
They're the ones
with the wallets.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.103
- But thank you for the fight.

25:20.145 --> 25:22.230
It's the only time
I feel anything anymore.

25:22.272 --> 25:24.399
When we come back,
we're talking to Kaitlyn

25:24.441 --> 25:25.900
about her dream she shed.

25:25.942 --> 25:27.485
[both chuckle]

25:27.527 --> 25:29.654
- Rrr.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.531
- We were too good?

25:31.573 --> 25:33.116
My curse!

25:33.158 --> 25:34.909
- If the Property Brothers
aren't gonna back us,

25:34.951 --> 25:38.204
then we need to back ourselves!

25:38.246 --> 25:39.914
Guys,

25:39.956 --> 25:42.584
we need to do our own tour.

25:42.625 --> 25:43.877
- Yeah, but how?

25:43.918 --> 25:45.378
We don't have
any infrastructure.

25:45.420 --> 25:48.882
No promoter,
no venues lined up, no bus.

25:48.923 --> 25:52.385
- Gloria, I know you want to do
your no consequence eff-spree--

25:52.427 --> 25:54.220
- No, it's not only that.

25:54.262 --> 25:58.099
People liked us.
Our peers liked us.

25:58.141 --> 26:00.101
- That is better
than our old fanbase

26:00.143 --> 26:02.979
of bald pervs begging for
lipstick prints on their heads.

26:03.021 --> 26:05.815
I don't know though.
Where would we even start?

26:05.857 --> 26:07.484
[cell phone buzzes]

26:07.525 --> 26:08.818
Ugh.

26:08.860 --> 26:10.528
- Yo, it's Bootsy Tings!

26:10.570 --> 26:11.654
- What do you want, Stinker?

26:11.696 --> 26:12.947
- It's Bootsy Tings.

26:12.989 --> 26:15.283
I've never been anyone else.

26:15.325 --> 26:17.869
Any-y'all,
is this y'all's song?

26:17.911 --> 26:21.998
all: * 'Cause Cow Town
is a wow town with a... *

26:22.040 --> 26:24.459
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, it is our song.

26:24.501 --> 26:27.796
all: * It's time to tap... *

26:27.837 --> 26:29.047
- It is...
- What?

26:29.089 --> 26:30.382
all:
* Into your Fort Worth *

26:30.423 --> 26:32.050
* The home
of Hagman and Meester *

26:32.092 --> 26:33.802
- Hey, y'all got
to get down here!

26:33.843 --> 26:35.595
Y'all are huge in Fort Worth!

26:35.637 --> 26:39.391
- You guys, we have 28,000
streams on SoundCloud.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.517
- No.

26:40.558 --> 26:41.643
- There was a hole
in the marketplace!

26:41.685 --> 26:44.062
- Well, I guess
we found our first stop.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.605
- Ayy!
- Come on!

26:45.647 --> 26:47.482
- [laughs]
- Whoo!

26:47.524 --> 26:49.943
- You guys have fun!

26:49.984 --> 26:51.861
[upbeat, soft music]

26:51.903 --> 26:53.988
- What--
- What are you talking about?

26:54.030 --> 26:56.658
- Oh, I can't go.

26:56.700 --> 27:00.787
Kev can't take over for me,
but it's okay.

27:00.829 --> 27:01.996
It is.

27:02.038 --> 27:04.249
You guys have never
really needed me.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.876
I just do
the feminasty phrases,

27:06.918 --> 27:11.172
and we don't even
have those anymore, so...

27:11.214 --> 27:13.883
- Honey.
- Oh.

27:13.925 --> 27:16.302
- You haven't been useless
in months.

27:16.344 --> 27:18.555
- Hey, you co-wrote a song
with me.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.557
And you're actually singing
on this album.

27:20.598 --> 27:22.350
- Yeah, and you're
our moral compass.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.019
We're three pieces of shit
without you.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.520
- Maybe not me.
- That is exactly

27:25.562 --> 27:28.023
what a self-centered
piece of shit would say.

27:28.064 --> 27:29.441
[bright music]

27:29.482 --> 27:33.862
- I guess
I have really grown a lot.

27:33.903 --> 27:37.657
Maybe...Kev can grow too.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.034
- Okay, okay!
- Amen.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.369
- Okay, I'm in.
I'm in!

27:41.411 --> 27:45.707
But only if you promise
to be honest with Caroline.

27:45.749 --> 27:47.334
- Fine.

27:47.375 --> 27:48.501
- Now everyone
go clean up your shit

27:48.543 --> 27:50.879
and pack 47 underwears
of your choice.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.465
[all screaming]

27:53.506 --> 27:56.968
- * L-l-l-l-lap pool,
f-f-f-f-fobs *

27:57.010 --> 28:01.222
* G-g-g-g-gym that Lester Holt
was seen at once *

28:01.264 --> 28:03.391
- Kev.
[sighs]

28:03.433 --> 28:06.269
I'm going on the tour.
You're gonna stay with Stevia.

28:06.311 --> 28:08.188
- No, I'm not to be trusted!

28:08.229 --> 28:10.148
- You'll figure it out,

28:10.190 --> 28:12.525
just like I had to
when you went to Tampa.

28:12.567 --> 28:15.236
- [groans]
- Hey, listen to me.

28:15.278 --> 28:17.572
Be her best friend,
not her parent.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.616
Win her heart
through possessions.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.201
- Oh.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.411
- And find out what she's up to
by posing as an older,

28:23.453 --> 28:27.874
very cool CGI shapewear CEO
on TikTok.

28:27.916 --> 28:30.210
I'll give you the account
and the password I made up.

28:30.251 --> 28:32.253
Also--
- Can I get paper?

28:32.295 --> 28:35.799
- Hey, buddy.
You're gonna be a big brother.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.301
- I wanna play lacrosse!

28:38.343 --> 28:40.136
- There goes
our New York lonely boy.

28:40.178 --> 28:41.930
- That happened too fast.

28:41.971 --> 28:43.556
[clock dings]
[coughs]

28:43.598 --> 28:45.225
Jesus, Max!

28:45.266 --> 28:47.352
- I guess
this is goodbye forever.

28:47.394 --> 28:48.770
- Why?

28:48.812 --> 28:51.272
- Because I'm leaving,
and you can't come with me.

28:51.314 --> 28:53.733
- Wickie,
I don't want this to end.

28:53.775 --> 28:58.947
There's technology now.
We can just J.O. over FaceTime.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.657
- I'd like that.

29:00.699 --> 29:04.661
- Look, my path may lead
right back to you,

29:04.703 --> 29:07.122
and I know you said
it isn't great out there,

29:07.163 --> 29:10.333
but I have to learn that
for myself.

29:10.375 --> 29:14.379
I'm so sorry, and I love you.

29:14.421 --> 29:16.464
- Oh, fuck you for this shit!

29:16.506 --> 29:19.467
You rope me back in
just to cut the fucking rope?

29:19.509 --> 29:21.928
- You just keep
the fucking apartment, okay?

29:21.970 --> 29:24.848
- Then I just mix it up.
- You got it.

29:24.889 --> 29:26.516
- Oh, I'm scared,
but I'm doing it!

29:26.558 --> 29:28.685
- You got it! Yeah!
- Stevia!

29:28.727 --> 29:31.271
This is your food!

29:31.312 --> 29:34.899
[upbeat music]

29:34.941 --> 29:37.152
[car horn honks]
- [gasps] All right.

29:37.193 --> 29:38.194
- Ahh!
- Whoo!

29:38.236 --> 29:39.946
- I could ride in this!
- Hey.

29:39.988 --> 29:42.407
I needed new wheels
since the Cube blew up, anyway.

29:42.449 --> 29:45.493
- And we got...
* A driver *

29:45.535 --> 29:47.203
[all cheer]

29:47.245 --> 29:49.456
- I'm Percy. [laughs]
I'm scared on highways.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.124
- Are you scared of bags?
- No.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.667
- Here's some food
for the road.

29:52.709 --> 29:55.712
The hot one's bagel pizzas
and the wet one's peaches.

29:57.714 --> 30:01.092
- Lunch lord.

30:01.134 --> 30:03.053
I've only ever said this
to a golf cart

30:03.094 --> 30:06.848
I thought contained
Billy Porter, but...

30:06.890 --> 30:08.516
[softly]
I love you.

30:08.558 --> 30:10.226
- I love you too.

30:10.268 --> 30:12.103
It'd be nice
if you called me Sheawn.

30:12.145 --> 30:14.022
[both chuckle]

30:14.064 --> 30:17.609
* *

30:17.650 --> 30:19.652
- Muah.

30:19.694 --> 30:22.530
- We'll meet you in every city
that has good ramen.

30:22.572 --> 30:25.241
- Good luck, Mommy.
- Mm, thank you, my babe.

30:25.283 --> 30:27.369
Muah.
I love you both so much.

30:27.410 --> 30:30.663
- Are you Ted Lasso-ing?
No one will root for you, miss!

30:30.705 --> 30:32.916
- Shut up,
and let me live my life!

30:32.957 --> 30:35.085
- Get outta here!
- Fuck off!

30:35.126 --> 30:37.337
- Whoo!
- Come on! Okay.

30:37.379 --> 30:39.005
I'm gonna learn maps!

30:39.047 --> 30:41.174
- Bye!

30:41.216 --> 30:44.511
- Next stop, Fort Worth.
After that, I don't know.

30:44.552 --> 30:46.888
We'll figure it out.
Tour mode! Whoo!

30:46.930 --> 30:48.348
- Tour mode!
- Tour mode!

30:48.390 --> 30:49.891
