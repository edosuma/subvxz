Steph, my favorite part
about you being engaged

01:06.232 --> 01:08.526
is that I get to shop
while eating breakfast.

01:10.403 --> 01:13.198
Oh. How about this wedding dress?

01:14.157 --> 01:15.658
Oh. Sure.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.036
I'll just have to sell a kidney
to pay for it.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.997
So that's a solid maybe.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.252
You and Jimmy
are gonna have a great wedding.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.213
You're so lucky to be engaged!

01:28.296 --> 01:31.007
Kimmy, aren't you and Fernando
engaged, too?

01:31.716 --> 01:32.926
It's been so long,

01:33.009 --> 01:35.845
I honestly can't remember
if we're engaged or divorced.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.723
I think it might be both.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.938
Well, have you thought about
asking Fernando for clarification?

01:45.522 --> 01:48.525
Oh, I would, but the accent
is so hard to understand.

01:50.610 --> 01:54.489
Well, I'm no detective, but I have watched
a lot of Hallmark Mysteries...

01:55.949 --> 01:59.035
and there's something keeping you
from taking the next step forward.

01:59.119 --> 02:03.748
Guess you're right. Fernando and I
have been engaged for, like, three years,

02:03.832 --> 02:07.460
and I don't feel like we're any closer
to actually getting married.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.587
You're not certain Fernando's the one?

02:09.671 --> 02:13.299
Well, I knew Jimmy was the one
after I dated all those losers in England.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.345
By the way,<i> </i>an English accent
does not mean you're smart.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.763
Ahem. Daniel Radcliffe.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.935
Well, it's hard for me to say.
I never really dated that much.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.396
My longest relationship
before Fernando

02:26.479 --> 02:28.857
was with the poster
of Kirk Cameron on my wall.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.902
Kimmy, you still have that on your wall.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.195
You know that's right.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.867
Yeah, I never understood
why Kirk Cameron was such a big deal.

02:40.952 --> 02:44.414
I dunno. Well, Fernando
certainly got to shop around.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.625
While you guys were broken up,
he dated, like, half the planet.

02:47.709 --> 02:51.171
Yeah. While I was busy raising Ramona
and building my business.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.674
I gave my best years
to <i>Teletubbies</i> and confetti cannons.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.136
You can't go into
a potential second marriage

02:58.219 --> 02:59.554
if you're not completely sure.

03:00.513 --> 03:03.766
You're right, Deej.
I should go on a few dates.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.435
Do a little window shopping.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.312
That's not what I was saying.

03:08.271 --> 03:12.025
Not necessarily buying but browsing.
That is a great idea.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.444
Again, not what I was saying.

03:15.737 --> 03:16.738
Thanks, Deej.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.910
You see, this is why
I never give Kimmy relationship advice.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.412
I wasn't.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.793
Rocki, I can't wait for you to meet Ethan.
He's awesome.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.129
The bar is pretty low,
since your last boyfriends

03:33.213 --> 03:35.632
were Popko and that guy from the boy band.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.426
I want to say Menudo?

03:40.637 --> 03:44.265
I want to say Menudo, too,
but sadly, it was Sexy Zone.

It's like those two have some sort of
secret past we don't know about.

Or... they have some secret past
that we don't know about.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.748
Wow. I wish I'd thought of that.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.419
Whatever it is,
we have to get to the bottom of it.

26:39.472 --> 26:41.474
You've always been the one for me.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.560
Hmm?

26:43.643 --> 26:46.771
You make my heart race
every time I see you.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.107
When we dance, time stands still.

26:49.941 --> 26:54.112
And when I look at your eyes...
all I see are Ramona's eyes.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.866
And that's how I know
we are meant for each other.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.578
My Kimberlina.

27:02.287 --> 27:05.206
You just made me
the happiest man on Earth.

27:09.711 --> 27:10.712
One more thing.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.090
I kept my FBI jacket.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.219
Ooh. Special Detective.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.805
You have the right to remain sexy.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.891
[chuckles]

27:27.270 --> 27:31.608
Oh. I guess everything worked out
for Kimmy and Fernando.

27:31.691 --> 27:33.109
Certainly looks that way.

27:35.195 --> 27:38.782
That would explain why Jason Bateman
keeps doing donuts in our driveway.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.162
I'm Kirk Cameron!
