WEBVTT

00:00.004 --> 00:01.970
Over 20 years?

00:03.408 --> 00:05.368
Thirty?

00:05.452 --> 00:07.120
Forty?

00:07.203 --> 00:10.248
- How about fifty?
- Fifty-five.

00:11.541 --> 00:13.625
Fifty-five years. Wow.

00:14.544 --> 00:16.754
And what is your name, ma'am?

00:16.837 --> 00:19.299
- Agnes.
- Yeah, I think you mean Saint Agnes.

00:19.382 --> 00:21.801
Yes. Yes, I do.

00:21.884 --> 00:24.262
Well, Francis and I
are only halfway there,

00:24.345 --> 00:26.598
but I bet you know your husband
as well as you know yourself.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.182
- Am I right?
- Yes, I do.

00:28.266 --> 00:31.436
Well, I know Francis Underwood.

00:31.519 --> 00:34.522
I know what keeps him up at night.

00:34.606 --> 00:37.649
And I'm sure it's the same thing
that keeps your husbands up, too.

00:37.733 --> 00:41.988
The future. How can I ensure
a better future for my family?

00:42.071 --> 00:45.866
Except... Francis, as President...

00:45.950 --> 00:49.787
his focus is on the progress
of all American families.

00:49.870 --> 00:51.289
You know what he said to me last night?

00:51.372 --> 00:55.668
He said, "Claire, my entire presidential
agenda, it's very simple.

00:55.751 --> 00:59.380
I want to be able to look
every single American in the eye,

00:59.464 --> 01:01.757
and know that I have made
their lives better."

01:02.800 --> 01:04.593
Yes.

01:04.677 --> 01:08.264
I have to say, Mrs. Underwood,
I find you very charming.

01:08.348 --> 01:10.600
And you seem quite honest.

01:10.683 --> 01:15.355
But I have trouble believing that your
husband truly cares about people.

01:15.438 --> 01:18.983
Well, Francis Underwood is a good man.

01:19.066 --> 01:21.693
He's dedicated and generous.

01:21.777 --> 01:24.322
And I have 28 years of proof.

01:24.405 --> 01:27.492
And I can honestly say,
even if I wasn't married to him,

01:27.575 --> 01:29.327
he would definitely have my vote.

01:29.410 --> 01:31.329
Thank you.

01:31.412 --> 01:34.748
Negligence. Nepotism.

01:34.832 --> 01:37.043
Misappropriation of federal funds.

01:37.126 --> 01:41.631
A foreign policy fiasco
and loose with the truth.

01:41.714 --> 01:43.508
What do these five fingers
have in common?

01:43.591 --> 01:45.468
Francis J. Underwood.

01:45.552 --> 01:47.345
Mr. King, I would
like to respond to that.

01:47.428 --> 01:50.515
This is a man who believes
in the rule of law-ish.

01:50.598 --> 01:54.894
The legislative process-ish.
The Constitution-ish.

01:54.977 --> 01:56.479
Is this the man who should be president?

01:56.563 --> 02:01.526
Ms. Dunbar, like any good lawyer,
you have a knack for rhetoric-ish.

02:01.609 --> 02:04.028
But the American people
are tired of words.

02:04.111 --> 02:06.739
What they crave is action.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.282
My concern about focusing
on the word, "action,"

02:09.366 --> 02:12.245
is that she'll just
come back with failed actions.

02:12.328 --> 02:13.954
America Works, the UN mission.

02:14.038 --> 02:17.041
"Action" performed well
with key demos in our last poll.

02:17.124 --> 02:19.335
Yes, but doesn't this
take us off message?

02:19.419 --> 02:23.214
We have been saying, "A vote for Frank
Underwood is a vote for America Works."

02:23.297 --> 02:24.882
That's what we've been running on.

02:24.965 --> 02:27.510
You need a word
that goes beyond America Works.

02:27.594 --> 02:30.680
- Something that can be used for anything.
- Remy, what do you think?

02:31.556 --> 02:34.141
- Uh...
- We're talking about the word, "action."

02:34.225 --> 02:37.353
Sorry, I was, uh... My mind was
on the foreign policy argument.

02:37.437 --> 02:40.106
- I was just thinking ahead.
- What about "vision"?

02:40.189 --> 02:41.941
Isn't that too generic?

02:42.024 --> 02:44.277
That's what we want.
I mean, the more generic, the better.

02:44.360 --> 02:47.029
People can project anything
they want on "vision."

02:47.113 --> 02:50.324
I'll get it polled before tomorrow.
We should work on Sharp next.

02:50.408 --> 02:51.743
You want me to play her?

02:51.825 --> 02:54.454
Thank you for taking your role
so seriously, Donald.

02:54.537 --> 02:56.788
You should consider
a career on the stage.

02:56.872 --> 02:59.959
Because he sure as hell
isn't gonna be on my ticket.

03:03.504 --> 03:06.507
You're good at this.
They loved you.

03:06.591 --> 03:09.385
Three decades of campaigns,
you learn how to read an audience.

03:09.469 --> 03:12.513
Self-promotion gives me hives.
Honestly, I don't know how you do it.

03:12.597 --> 03:14.724
I'm promoting my husband, not myself.

03:14.806 --> 03:17.310
That's a convenient way to spin it,
don't you think?

03:18.311 --> 03:19.687
Are you always this blunt?

03:19.771 --> 03:22.356
I only have two days to tag along.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.234
Mind if I ride with you,
since we have so little time?

03:25.318 --> 03:28.279
I need to make some calls.
Maybe we'll find some time later.

03:39.540 --> 03:43.336
Remy, you were distracted earlier.
What's going on?

03:43.419 --> 03:45.421
Oh. Nothing. Everything's good.

03:45.505 --> 03:47.047
I need you on your A-game, Remy.

03:47.131 --> 03:49.425
This debate could make us
the front-runner.

03:49.509 --> 03:52.178
It's just between the campaign
and managing the White House,

03:52.261 --> 03:54.388
- I'm a little burnt out.
- We still have months to go.

03:54.472 --> 03:57.558
- A year before the general.
- It's temporary. I'll get past it.

03:57.642 --> 03:59.310
If you can do it, I can.

04:42.353 --> 04:43.813
Gavin?

04:43.896 --> 04:46.482
- Hello, Douglas.
- What do you want?

04:46.566 --> 04:49.443
You still can't believe she's dead,
can you?

04:50.862 --> 04:54.031
Well, you shouldn't.
'Cause she's not.

04:54.114 --> 04:56.701
She's alive,
and I know exactly where she is.

04:58.285 --> 04:59.620
I've known for a while.

04:59.704 --> 05:01.455
- What?
- Look on your laptop.

05:12.759 --> 05:17.597
No, you...
you showed me the picture.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.224
- Of her body.
- That wasn't her.

05:20.307 --> 05:23.310
I forged it all so you'd
lift my passport lock.

05:23.394 --> 05:26.439
Well, I'm out now, Doug.

05:26.522 --> 05:29.817
And I'm safe. But my friend isn't.

05:29.901 --> 05:31.444
Talk to Green.

05:31.527 --> 05:34.530
Get him the same deal you got me,
all charges dropped.

05:34.614 --> 05:37.700
You do that,
and I'll tell you where she is.

05:44.749 --> 05:45.957
Ah!

Sync and corrections by n17t01

08:40.591 --> 08:42.134
- Hey, Meechum.
- Sir.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.385
Mr. President.

08:43.469 --> 08:45.930
Thank you for coming
all the way to Andrews.

08:46.013 --> 08:49.182
Did Remy walk you
through the broad strokes?

08:49.266 --> 08:51.769
No matter the policy question,
foreign or domestic,

08:51.852 --> 08:53.646
we hammer Dunbar's lack of experience.

08:53.729 --> 08:58.150
We bludgeon it. We cannot say
"lack of experience" enough.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.653
And no doubt, she'll bring up
Claire's recess appointment,

09:00.736 --> 09:03.572
where I can't take the bait,
so I leave that entirely to you.

09:03.656 --> 09:05.992
This was one of the things
that I was hoping to discuss.

09:06.075 --> 09:07.660
Oh, you don't want to call her "sexist"?

09:07.743 --> 09:10.579
- The argument doesn't hold.
- It does hold.

09:10.663 --> 09:12.706
She says that Claire was unqualified.

09:12.790 --> 09:15.709
You say she wouldn't say that
about a man with the same CV.

09:15.793 --> 09:17.169
I'm not sure that's true.

09:17.252 --> 09:19.880
And calling another woman sexist
when there's a man on the stage--

09:19.964 --> 09:23.926
And who else is better but you to call
her out on what she's done for women,

09:24.010 --> 09:25.552
which is absolutely nothing?

09:25.636 --> 09:29.682
Whereas gender-equality legislation
is one of your hallmarks.

09:29.765 --> 09:31.684
But it could hurt me
more than it hurts her.

09:33.060 --> 09:34.687
I thought we had an understanding.

09:34.770 --> 09:37.189
You were gonna play pit bull
while I play presidential.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.650
Will you get a little bloody?
Yes, probably.

09:39.733 --> 09:41.527
But that's what people want
in their debates.

09:41.610 --> 09:44.530
And then you and I together,
we bury her.

09:44.613 --> 09:47.658
You drop out next week,
endorse me and the race is over.

09:47.741 --> 09:49.743
I have no problem being forceful.

09:49.827 --> 09:52.788
But this sexism thing,
and the whole school argument, I--

09:52.872 --> 09:55.708
- Oh. You mean her kids.
- I really don't want to involve them.

09:55.791 --> 09:58.627
We have two things we want
the American people to hear:

09:58.711 --> 10:02.297
she lacks experience and she was born
with a silver spoon in her mouth.

10:02.381 --> 10:03.799
But there has to be another way.

10:03.883 --> 10:06.259
She wants to trumpet
an equal playing field?

10:06.343 --> 10:09.013
Then why does she send her own kids
to private school?

10:09.096 --> 10:13.266
That is a clear and simple argument that
everyone can get their heads around.

10:13.350 --> 10:16.812
And it doesn't hurt that Iowa's biggest
employer is the public school system.

10:16.896 --> 10:19.190
Alan sends his kids to private school.

10:20.232 --> 10:21.817
Yeah, but they're not your kids.

10:21.901 --> 10:24.070
They're my step-kids.
And that makes me a hypocrite.

10:28.074 --> 10:29.950
Is that really
what you're concerned about?

10:30.034 --> 10:31.869
Being a hypocrite?

10:33.746 --> 10:35.330
It's my family.

10:35.414 --> 10:39.376
Oh, trust me, they'll understand
the moment they step into the White House.

10:39.459 --> 10:41.628
Jackie, I really
shouldn't have to convince you

10:41.712 --> 10:44.173
to do what it takes to get a set of keys.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.761
I'll be the pit bull, Mr. President.

10:48.844 --> 10:50.429
Thank you, Jackie.

10:53.099 --> 10:55.475
- Are we all clear?
- The press has boarded, sir.

10:55.559 --> 10:57.477
- All right, make sure no one sees her.
- Yes, sir.

10:57.561 --> 10:59.980
Flight time to
Des Moines today will be two hours...

11:00.064 --> 11:05.027
Such a pity how much ruthless pragmatism
gets weighed down by family values.

11:05.111 --> 11:07.362
Without her doctor
and his pimply-faced brood,

11:07.446 --> 11:09.782
she could soar as high as this plane.

11:09.865 --> 11:13.452
Oh, I know, the marriage was my idea.
Don't remind me.

11:23.045 --> 11:25.547
- Doug.
- Hey.

11:25.631 --> 11:27.883
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

11:27.967 --> 11:30.677
What, did you get
locked out or something?

11:30.761 --> 11:34.140
I felt the need to drink.

11:34.223 --> 11:36.600
I got this far and I stopped myself.

11:37.726 --> 11:40.229
Okay.

11:40.311 --> 11:42.022
I wanted you to see it.

11:42.106 --> 11:44.191
That I could control it.

11:47.569 --> 11:50.072
You wanna go back up?

11:50.156 --> 11:51.865
Yeah.

12:08.465 --> 12:10.217
I know it looks crazy.

12:11.468 --> 12:12.886
But I had to do it.

12:12.970 --> 12:14.387
Why?

12:16.223 --> 12:19.726
There was this girl...
before the injury.

12:21.478 --> 12:24.606
She left me.
So I started drinking.

12:26.525 --> 12:27.818
I tried to shut her out,

12:27.901 --> 12:31.488
but I just kept checking my e-mails,
my text messages.

12:33.532 --> 12:36.367
It needed to stop.

12:36.451 --> 12:38.162
Who was she?

12:40.706 --> 12:43.834
You know what? That's okay.

12:43.917 --> 12:45.294
Doesn't matter.

12:46.837 --> 12:50.674
What matters is that you got pushed
to the edge today and you didn't fall off.

12:52.134 --> 12:53.593
You did what you had to do.

12:55.095 --> 12:56.722
I don't judge you for it.

12:58.015 --> 13:00.309
And I don't think it's crazy.

13:27.336 --> 13:30.505
We could've met somewhere
a little warmer.

13:30.589 --> 13:33.550
Walmart wanted to knock this down,
build a store here.

13:33.633 --> 13:35.844
- But the community put a stop to it.
- I know.

13:35.928 --> 13:39.723
Because they wouldn't give a tax credit
unless entry-level wages were higher.

13:39.806 --> 13:41.850
So which is better?
A shitty job, or no job?

13:41.934 --> 13:44.561
- Well, I think I know your answer.
- Don't be so sure.

13:44.644 --> 13:49.482
Jackie, you have repeatedly opposed
the minimum-wage and CEO salary bill

13:49.566 --> 13:53.362
- I asked the leadership to introduce.
- I've put a lot of thought into it.

13:53.444 --> 13:54.947
This community took a stand.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.950
If enough of them do, Congress
won't have a choice but to act.

13:58.033 --> 13:59.701
Are we here to talk about legislation?

13:59.785 --> 14:02.453
Because we both
have a debate in six hours.

14:04.290 --> 14:05.874
I want to endorse you.

14:07.293 --> 14:10.296
I'll lay off you tonight.
You and I attack Underwood.

14:10.379 --> 14:13.757
In three days,
I'll drop out and endorse.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.843
- We haven't even had the first caucus.
- You two are neck-and-neck.

14:16.927 --> 14:19.763
I have 14 points in Iowa,
twelve in New Hampshire.

14:19.846 --> 14:24.017
You get my people,
you have a clear win in both states.

14:24.101 --> 14:26.979
My endorsement is valuable.

14:27.062 --> 14:28.521
How much does Underwood value it?

14:28.605 --> 14:30.482
- Highly.
- What did he offer you?

14:33.860 --> 14:36.155
I'm more interested
in what you have to offer.

14:36.238 --> 14:38.740
Did he promise a cabinet position?

14:41.493 --> 14:43.203
More than that?

14:44.997 --> 14:48.417
He offered to put you
on the ticket, didn't he?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.585
I wouldn't expect to be
on your ticket, Heather.

14:50.669 --> 14:53.005
You need a Southerner with a penis.

14:53.088 --> 14:55.882
I was thinking Secretary of Defense,
given my war record.

14:55.966 --> 14:58.302
But I'd be open to other ideas.

15:01.096 --> 15:04.308
I would love your support, Jackie,
but I offer you nothing.

15:06.101 --> 15:08.687
But... this is an easy win.

15:08.770 --> 15:10.939
I'm not gonna start
selling off cabinet positions

15:11.023 --> 15:12.774
before I've won the White House.

15:12.858 --> 15:16.069
Those decisions will be
based purely on merit.

15:17.404 --> 15:21.367
If I'm gonna lock up this nomination
for you, I deserve to be compensated.

15:21.450 --> 15:25.120
I plan on winning, Jackie.
Just... not your way.

15:25.204 --> 15:28.123
And with or without your support.

15:28.207 --> 15:30.209
Then I'm sticking with Underwood.

15:30.292 --> 15:32.336
You do what you have to do.

15:51.271 --> 15:53.482
Is Jackie in here?

15:53.565 --> 15:55.234
Hi, Bob.

15:55.317 --> 15:56.693
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:56.776 --> 15:58.111
Sorry I'm late.

15:58.195 --> 16:00.364
- How did your surgery go?
- Terrible.

16:00.447 --> 16:02.657
The patient almost didn't make it.

16:02.741 --> 16:04.951
- But he's alive?
- She. And yeah.

16:05.035 --> 16:06.912
- Stable condition.
- Oh...

16:06.995 --> 16:08.955
It means so much to me that you came.

16:09.039 --> 16:10.541
All done.

16:10.623 --> 16:12.959
- Do you like?
- It's good. Thank you.

16:15.546 --> 16:18.840
- So, how'd it go with--?
- Thanks.

16:23.178 --> 16:26.265
- What'd she offer?
- Nothing.

16:26.348 --> 16:29.059
- Nothing at all?
- I know, I was surprised, too.

16:29.142 --> 16:30.977
It's foolish. She could lock this up.

16:31.978 --> 16:35.190
I have to say,
I almost... respect it.

16:35.274 --> 16:37.484
Anyway, you were right.

16:37.568 --> 16:39.652
Stick with the devil you know.

16:42.448 --> 16:44.657
Are the kids watching tonight?

16:44.741 --> 16:47.619
Yeah. They've got all their friends
over at the house.

16:48.579 --> 16:50.956
Listen, the ki--

16:51.039 --> 16:52.583
What?

16:54.126 --> 16:57.670
Nothing. How do I look?

16:58.755 --> 17:01.883
I'd throw you on that bed right now
if it wouldn't mess up your hair.

17:03.885 --> 17:05.512
Mm...

17:06.012 --> 17:07.598
Watch me prep.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.767
You can mess up my hair all you want
after the debate.

17:17.773 --> 17:19.901
- She's here.
- There she is.

17:29.620 --> 17:32.038
Quiet, guys. Quiet, guys.
Here she comes.

17:32.831 --> 17:36.042
Quiet, quiet!

17:42.090 --> 17:45.260
Thank you. Thank you.
Hello, everyone!

17:46.303 --> 17:49.264
Thank all of you so very much

17:49.348 --> 17:51.933
for working so hard to make sure
we take New Hampshire.

17:55.145 --> 17:57.856
It is field offices like this
that win primaries,

17:57.939 --> 18:01.109
and the president wants you to know
how much your dedication means to us.

18:01.193 --> 18:02.902
Thank you so much. Thank you.

18:04.488 --> 18:07.115
- Now, who's ready to watch a debate?
- Yeah!

18:07.199 --> 18:09.535
There is a large crowd here
in Sioux City tonight.

18:09.618 --> 18:12.704
I would say potential voters,
but of course, here in Iowa,

18:12.787 --> 18:16.124
citizens caucus instead of vote,
and many of the people here in this room

18:16.208 --> 18:19.336
will be doing just that on January 15th.

18:19.419 --> 18:23.423
A CNN ORC poll has it as a tight race
between the two front-runners.

18:23.507 --> 18:26.092
Heather Dunbar at 32 percent.

18:26.176 --> 18:28.428
President Frank Underwood at 30 percent.

18:28.512 --> 18:32.474
Congresswoman Jackie Sharp trails
in third at 14 percent.

18:32.558 --> 18:35.101
Twenty-two percent remain undecided.

18:35.185 --> 18:36.978
You can switch it.

18:37.062 --> 18:38.480
Really?

18:38.564 --> 18:41.191
- Unless you want to watch.
- No, I thought you would.

18:41.274 --> 18:43.443
It's your last night here.

18:44.570 --> 18:47.364
I want to spend it with my brother,
not Frank Underwood.

18:47.447 --> 18:49.449
What do you want to watch instead?

18:49.533 --> 18:52.202
Anything. Whatever you want.

18:52.285 --> 18:55.455
...promising universal employment,
and on Israeli Palestinian relations...

18:55.539 --> 18:58.958
Oh, shit.
Have you ever seen Contagion?

18:59.042 --> 19:00.502
No.

19:00.586 --> 19:03.296
If you're a clean freak, this'll
definitely make you a germ freak.

19:03.380 --> 19:06.174
- I love this movie.
- Go for it.

19:14.974 --> 19:17.852
Welcome to the first Democratic
nomination debate hosted by CNN.

19:17.936 --> 19:21.773
Our candidates tonight: Frank Underwood,
Jackie Sharp, and Heather Dunbar.

19:21.856 --> 19:24.025
I'm John King and
I'll be your moderator tonight.

19:24.109 --> 19:25.860
Our debate will be divided in two parts,

19:25.944 --> 19:28.614
the first part focusing
on foreign policy,

19:28.697 --> 19:30.990
part two focusing
on the domestic agenda.

19:31.074 --> 19:35.704
And our format will be as follows:
I will ask one candidate a question.

19:35.787 --> 19:37.997
That candidate will have
one minute to answer.

19:38.081 --> 19:41.042
After that, all of our candidates
can engage in an open conversation

19:41.126 --> 19:44.296
lasting for five minutes.
We begin, though, with opening statements.

19:44.379 --> 19:47.633
And by lottery, it was decided
that President Underwood goes first.

19:47.716 --> 19:50.051
- Mr. President.
- Thank you. And good evening, John,

19:50.135 --> 19:54.431
good evening to my fellow candidates,
and to the good people of Sioux City.

19:54.514 --> 19:58.143
This nomination comes down
to one word: vision.

19:58.226 --> 20:01.647
I believe that I have shown
a clear vision to this country

20:01.730 --> 20:05.275
with America Works,
the most comprehensive jobs program

20:05.358 --> 20:07.026
in nearly a century.

20:07.110 --> 20:09.696
We showed it could work
in Washington DC.

20:09.780 --> 20:13.784
We need now to take what we did there
and spread it nationwide,

20:13.866 --> 20:17.537
so that the American dream
can become the American reality.

20:17.621 --> 20:21.500
But that vision isn't enough on its own.

20:21.583 --> 20:25.295
You need someone
with experience to make it happen.

20:25.378 --> 20:28.298
And between my time in Congress
and now at the White House,

20:28.381 --> 20:32.218
I have more experience than
both of my opponents combined.

20:32.302 --> 20:34.805
And, uh, when you hire someone for a job,

20:34.887 --> 20:37.349
are you gonna hire someone
with 30 years' experience,

20:37.432 --> 20:41.394
or someone with less than ten
or someone with no experience at all?

20:41.478 --> 20:45.816
Where I come from down south, we call
that as clear as a glass of moonshine.

20:49.861 --> 20:51.988
Former Solicitor General
Dunbar is next.

20:52.071 --> 20:54.324
- Your opening statement, please.
- Thank you, John.

20:54.407 --> 20:56.117
And thank you Iowa.

20:56.201 --> 20:59.705
Well, I agree with the president.

20:59.788 --> 21:03.792
Vision and experience
are exactly what America needs.

21:03.875 --> 21:08.296
Unfortunately, he has the wrong vision
and horrendous experience.

21:08.380 --> 21:12.467
You can call America Works visionary,
but in truth,

21:12.551 --> 21:16.638
it is just an ultra-conservative agenda
that's been around for decades.

21:16.722 --> 21:20.141
Dismantle the safety net
and hang people out to dry.

21:20.225 --> 21:23.729
As for the president's experience,
he was in the leadership

21:23.812 --> 21:27.858
during one of the most ineffective
decades in Congressional history.

21:27.940 --> 21:30.985
As president, he has failed
at everything he's done.

21:31.069 --> 21:36.282
America Works was illegal in the minds
of many legal experts, myself included.

21:36.366 --> 21:39.118
His Jordan Valley plan was a disaster.

21:39.202 --> 21:41.204
If that's what you call experience,

21:41.287 --> 21:45.375
you're not just padding the rÃ©sumÃ©,
you are fabricating it.

21:45.458 --> 21:49.379
President Underwood
isn't presenting us with a vision,

21:49.462 --> 21:53.132
he is convincing himself
of his own delusion.

21:53.216 --> 21:57.387
Now, my vision
is to tackle corporate greed,

21:57.470 --> 21:59.639
raise pay for those who need it most,

21:59.723 --> 22:02.559
and create jobs by growing the economy,

22:02.642 --> 22:05.854
not robbing people
of their retirement and health care.

22:05.937 --> 22:11.192
My experience is 20 years
defending the Constitution.

22:11.276 --> 22:16.364
You know when I take my presidential
oath, I will mean every word of it.

22:20.619 --> 22:22.621
Ms. Dunbar, thank you.
Congresswoman Sharp,

22:22.704 --> 22:24.915
- your opening statement, please.
- Thank you.

22:24.997 --> 22:28.334
As many of you know,
I am a US Army veteran.

22:28.418 --> 22:32.213
Now, I've seen firsthand
the great sacrifices

22:32.297 --> 22:35.884
my fellow servicemen and women
have made defending this country.

22:35.966 --> 22:40.096
But how can we ask them
to protect a system

22:40.179 --> 22:42.140
that isn't protecting us?

22:42.223 --> 22:43.516
Take women, for example.

22:43.600 --> 22:46.394
There are two women
at this debate running for president.

22:46.478 --> 22:50.231
That's extraordinary.
But out in the general workforce?

22:50.315 --> 22:54.778
Women earn 77 cents
on the dollar compared to men.

22:54.861 --> 22:59.783
Even worse is minority women
earning 67 cents on the dollar.

22:59.866 --> 23:04.162
Now, Ms. Dunbar can talk
about balancing the scales,

23:04.245 --> 23:07.791
but she inherited
a multi-billion-dollar fortune

23:07.874 --> 23:11.252
and never had to earn
any cents on the dollar.

23:11.336 --> 23:15.173
Now, I don't agree with everything
that President Underwood has done

23:15.256 --> 23:19.135
or proposes, but at least he knows
what it means to work for a living.

23:19.218 --> 23:21.554
I can give you even better than that.

23:21.638 --> 23:24.724
I know what it means
to fight for a living.

23:24.808 --> 23:28.269
And I will fight
for fairness here at home

23:28.353 --> 23:31.439
just as fiercely as
I fought our enemies overseas.

23:31.523 --> 23:33.692
Thank you.

23:33.775 --> 23:36.695
Thank you, Congresswoman.
Let's move to part one: foreign policy.

23:36.778 --> 23:38.905
And the first question
is for you, Mr. President.

23:38.989 --> 23:42.200
Given the recent volatile events
in the Jordan Valley, do you still believe

23:42.283 --> 23:45.495
it was correct to assemble the United
Nations coalition and to intervene,

23:45.578 --> 23:48.414
or is it time now
to call that intervention a mistake?

23:48.498 --> 23:51.376
Well, I will answer that question, John,
but I'd like to address first

23:51.459 --> 23:53.712
something Ms. Dunbar said
a few moments ago.

23:53.795 --> 23:57.340
America Works is not some stale,
old, conservative agenda.

23:57.423 --> 24:01.594
You name me one Republican
who has suggested using federal funds

24:01.678 --> 24:07.017
to guarantee jobs for every American
who wants one and I will eat my hat.

24:07.099 --> 24:09.519
This isn't about dismantling government.
It is about--

24:09.602 --> 24:12.605
Aren't we supposed to be talking
about foreign policy?

24:12.689 --> 24:15.191
Yeah, I will.
But first, I'd like to correct--

24:15.274 --> 24:17.527
Because it's easier
to talk about America Works

24:17.610 --> 24:19.571
than to defend your
indefensible UN mission.

24:19.654 --> 24:21.531
At least I have a record
to defend, Ms. Dunbar.

24:21.614 --> 24:23.408
Speaking of your record, Mr. President,

24:23.491 --> 24:26.661
you went on record saying
you wouldn't run for president.

24:26.745 --> 24:28.580
- And yet here you are.
- John, it seems that

24:28.663 --> 24:30.665
your very thoughtful rules
have gone out the window.

24:30.749 --> 24:32.584
You have no respect for rules,
Mr. President.

24:32.667 --> 24:34.335
Take FEMA, for example.

24:34.419 --> 24:36.963
Oh, you want to talk about FEMA now
instead of foreign policy.

24:37.047 --> 24:38.757
I am just following your lead, sir.

24:38.840 --> 24:42.052
See what a mess we get into when
we follow your brand of leadership?

24:43.511 --> 24:47.390
Well, I must admit that Ms. Dunbar
does have many years of experience

24:47.473 --> 24:50.100
making rhetorical arguments in court.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.896
You've just seen proof of that today.

24:52.979 --> 24:56.315
But serving the American people
is not about what you say,

24:56.399 --> 24:57.984
it's about what you do.

24:58.068 --> 25:00.946
And I would ask:
what have you ever done?

25:01.029 --> 25:04.908
I have to agree that Ms. Dunbar's
lack of experience is a concern.

25:04.991 --> 25:07.035
I find it ironic
that the president talks about

25:07.117 --> 25:09.370
the importance of experience,
given the fact

25:09.454 --> 25:11.706
that he appointed his wife
UN ambassador

25:11.790 --> 25:15.543
- despite her utter lack of credentials.
- That's a sexist comment.

25:15.627 --> 25:17.503
Excuse me?

25:17.587 --> 25:19.129
You wouldn't be making that argument

25:19.213 --> 25:22.258
if a female president
had appointed her husband.

25:22.341 --> 25:25.177
A husband with the same lack
of international affairs experience

25:25.261 --> 25:27.179
as Claire Underwood?
Yes, I would.

25:27.263 --> 25:30.725
In fact, it makes me question
your advocacy for women in general.

25:30.809 --> 25:32.351
Well, that's ridiculous.

25:32.435 --> 25:34.729
What have you done
to further gender equality?

25:34.813 --> 25:37.523
What have you done
to balance the scales?

25:37.607 --> 25:41.778
That's your slogan, and yet you've left
half of the population out of the mix.

25:41.861 --> 25:43.321
But that is simply not true.

25:43.404 --> 25:45.573
Can, can you name one specific thing?

25:45.657 --> 25:48.994
Yes, I can. Being a woman,
who has served as Solicitor General,

25:49.077 --> 25:51.370
one of the few
in the history of the court.

25:51.454 --> 25:53.039
Well, that advanced your interests,

25:53.123 --> 25:56.334
but what did that do
for 150 million women out there?

25:56.417 --> 25:58.377
The very fact that a woman
can hold that position--

25:58.461 --> 26:01.714
- So you are a symbol.
- In a way, yes, I suppose I am.

26:01.798 --> 26:04.009
Me and many other women,
including yourself--

26:04.092 --> 26:08.096
Okay, but how does that get us
from 77 cents on the dollar to 100?

26:08.178 --> 26:09.931
Real cents. Not symbolic cents.

26:10.015 --> 26:12.308
Well, now you're just
aping the president's rhetoric.

26:12.391 --> 26:14.144
Another sexist comment.

26:14.226 --> 26:16.228
How could you possibly
misconstrue my words?

26:16.312 --> 26:18.606
I speak for myself.

26:18.690 --> 26:21.526
I am not aping the president
or any other man.

26:21.609 --> 26:23.111
I'm sorry, I won't engage with this--

26:23.193 --> 26:26.031
You know, when things get tough
on the battlefield, we never say,

26:26.114 --> 26:30.994
"Sorry, I won't engage."
We engage, Ms. Dunbar.

26:33.287 --> 26:36.582
And you need to confront the fact

26:36.666 --> 26:40.003
that you do not have
women's best interests at heart.

26:40.086 --> 26:42.088
John, this is getting out of hand.

26:42.172 --> 26:44.507
All right, then let's move on
to the next question.

26:44.590 --> 26:46.759
We are in the foreign policy portion
of this debate.

26:46.843 --> 26:50.096
Ms. Dunbar, let me bring this question
to you. You're critical of the president.

26:50.180 --> 26:52.724
You say it's indefensible,
what he has done in the Jordan Valley.

26:52.807 --> 26:54.767
But specifically,
what would you do differently?

26:54.851 --> 26:58.396
Well, John, I'm glad you asked that.
Sending troops into the Jordan Valley...

26:58.479 --> 27:01.231
- I need to go back to the hotel.
- ...isn't what I call diplomacy.

27:01.315 --> 27:05.111
Everybody, Mrs. Underwood
needs to leave us now.

27:05.195 --> 27:09.074
I really wish I could stay,
but I have a very full day tomorrow.

27:09.157 --> 27:11.283
I should rest up.
But again, I want to thank you all

27:11.367 --> 27:13.828
for your hospitality
and all of your hard work.

27:13.912 --> 27:16.164
Thank you so much.

27:16.246 --> 27:18.041
Good night, everyone.

27:22.670 --> 27:28.300
His trickle-down diplomacy
is another example of delusion.

27:28.384 --> 27:30.302
Mrs. Underwood.

27:31.554 --> 27:33.932
Oh, you should go back inside
with the volunteers

27:34.015 --> 27:36.101
and have the full
campaign experience.

27:36.184 --> 27:39.145
I didn't come to New Hampshire for that.
I came to speak with you.

27:39.229 --> 27:42.190
Tomorrow, maybe.
My brain is a bit fried.

27:42.272 --> 27:45.026
Is it what Sharp said?
Why you don't want to watch anymore?

27:45.110 --> 27:48.071
- The sexist comment?
- Oh, I honestly don't care.

27:48.154 --> 27:49.906
It's all spectacle.

27:49.989 --> 27:51.950
Who can get the most points, right?

27:52.033 --> 27:53.451
Good night.

27:56.037 --> 27:58.206
Now for part two of our debate:
the domestic agenda.

27:58.288 --> 28:00.541
And the first question goes to you,
Congresswoman.

28:00.625 --> 28:02.376
The President speaks of America Works.

28:02.460 --> 28:06.005
Ms. Dunbar wants to raise minimum wage.
Talks about regulating executive pay.

28:06.089 --> 28:08.967
But a lot of people aren't quite clear
about your economic policy.

28:09.050 --> 28:11.301
What specifically,
I underscore "specifically,"

28:11.385 --> 28:13.054
would you do if elected president?

28:13.138 --> 28:16.641
Well, I plan to do a lot.
And we talked about this earlier.

28:16.724 --> 28:22.438
First and foremost, I want to press for
gender equality and close the salary gap.

28:22.521 --> 28:26.067
If half of the working population
has more money in their pockets,

28:26.151 --> 28:29.737
that will catalyze spending,
which will grow the economy,

28:29.821 --> 28:32.198
which will, in turn, create more jobs.

28:32.282 --> 28:34.159
Mr. President,
what do you think of that?

28:34.242 --> 28:37.536
Oh, I agree. I think that
gender equality is very important.

28:37.620 --> 28:42.708
And under my AmWorks program, there will
be a provision that all AmWorks jobs,

28:42.792 --> 28:45.795
there can be no discrepancy in pay
between men and women.

28:45.878 --> 28:49.299
AmWorks jobs, that's the government.
What about the rest of the private sector?

28:49.381 --> 28:51.634
We have to start by leading by example,
then we introduce--

28:51.717 --> 28:54.262
Leading by example? If America Works
is how you lead by example...

28:54.345 --> 28:55.972
I'm sorry, please let me finish my point.

28:56.055 --> 28:58.599
If that is how you lead by example,
then are we to assume

28:58.683 --> 29:02.353
that everyone should illegally raid funds
that they have no right to use?

29:02.436 --> 29:05.898
Everyone should start robbing banks?
Holding up liquor stores?

29:05.982 --> 29:09.610
Now, Ms. Dunbar, with all due respect,
you can criticize my programs

29:09.694 --> 29:12.613
as much as you want,
but to accuse me of illegal activity--

29:12.697 --> 29:15.533
One thing you can't deny
is that I am much more of an authority

29:15.616 --> 29:17.994
on the Constitution than you are,
Mr. President.

29:21.206 --> 29:25.626
Ms. Dunbar, all three of us on this
stage have taken oaths of office.

29:25.710 --> 29:29.672
I would have to say that we
have all defended the Constitution.

29:29.755 --> 29:33.009
You don't have some special claim
on the Constitution.

29:33.092 --> 29:35.386
The Constitution belongs
to everyone in this room

29:35.469 --> 29:37.388
and every citizen in the United States.

29:42.227 --> 29:46.522
But I would ask Ms. Sharp, you voted
in favor of dismantling America Works.

29:46.605 --> 29:51.069
Was that because you thought it was
in fact, as Ms. Dunbar says, illegal?

29:51.152 --> 29:54.697
I voted for dismantlement
because I wanted to make sure

29:54.780 --> 29:56.157
we were prepared for the hurricane,

29:56.241 --> 29:59.952
not because I thought your reading
of the Stafford Act was illegal per se.

30:00.036 --> 30:03.414
Honestly, you think the president
had a right to do what he did?

30:03.497 --> 30:05.375
It's an appropriations issue,
not a legal one.

30:05.457 --> 30:06.667
What about his character?

30:06.751 --> 30:08.794
He basically walked into FEMA and said,

30:08.878 --> 30:10.838
"Stick 'em up and show me
where the vault is."

30:10.922 --> 30:13.383
So now I'm a bank robber.
Six Gun Underwood,

30:13.465 --> 30:16.510
what they call me in South Carolina.

30:18.888 --> 30:21.599
I'm sorry, but I do not find this funny.

30:21.682 --> 30:25.103
I say you are a hypocrite.

30:25.186 --> 30:28.522
You claim to care about
the ten million people out of work,

30:28.606 --> 30:31.525
but you will steal
their disaster relief fund...

30:31.609 --> 30:34.946
- This is an appropriations issue.
- ...Social Security and health care.

30:35.029 --> 30:37.073
We put 50,000 people to work
in Washington DC.

30:37.156 --> 30:41.452
Heather Dunbar wants to balance
the scales to fix a broken system.

30:41.535 --> 30:45.206
And yet she sends her own kids
to private school.

30:45.290 --> 30:48.459
With money she never earned,
but which she inherited.

30:48.542 --> 30:51.587
Now, it is easy to talk
about the problems of the poor

30:51.670 --> 30:54.215
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

30:58.510 --> 31:00.805
Am I well-off? Absolutely.

31:00.888 --> 31:03.891
So was FDR when
he developed the New Deal.

31:03.975 --> 31:07.353
Since when does one's income
determine one's amount of empathy?

31:07.437 --> 31:09.147
Would you send your kids to public school?

31:09.230 --> 31:11.523
Let's keep our children out of this.

31:11.607 --> 31:13.734
You want your kids to have a head start,

31:13.818 --> 31:16.487
to have an advantage
over the kids in public schools.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.656
Lots of Americans,
of all ranges of income,

31:18.739 --> 31:21.617
choose to send their children
to private or parochial schools.

31:21.700 --> 31:24.329
But isn't it true
that you want your children

31:24.412 --> 31:26.747
to have a leg up on everyone else?

31:26.831 --> 31:30.668
Is that balancing the scales?
Or is that hypocrisy?

31:30.751 --> 31:33.587
Or maybe it's that you
didn't want to raise them yourself

31:33.671 --> 31:35.714
so you sent them to boarding school.

31:38.259 --> 31:39.469
Wow.

31:39.551 --> 31:41.512
You must really want to be president.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.808
I would never in a million years
bring up your children in a debate.

31:45.891 --> 31:48.853
The way you choose to raise them
is your business.

31:48.936 --> 31:52.398
Do I want the best for my kids?
Yes, I do.

31:52.482 --> 31:54.317
I imagine you're the same way.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.943
I hope you are.

31:57.487 --> 32:00.281
Well, I'm sure you're
both excellent mothers.

32:00.365 --> 32:02.033
But perhaps we should get back to some--

32:02.116 --> 32:05.036
Congresswoman Sharp raised
the issue of sexism earlier.

32:05.119 --> 32:08.080
Now, it is an important point,
and we need to address it.

32:08.164 --> 32:11.125
Sexism is wrong.
The Congresswoman is correct

32:11.209 --> 32:13.836
in saying that all aspects of it
should be illegal.

32:13.919 --> 32:18.216
And then, she accused me of being sexist
for criticizing Claire Underwood.

32:18.299 --> 32:20.801
But wouldn't that same logic
hold true for you, Ms. Sharp?

32:20.885 --> 32:23.846
Would you have come after my kids
if I were a man?

32:23.929 --> 32:26.932
Aren't you trying to paint the picture
that I'm a bad mother,

32:27.016 --> 32:29.435
shipping my kids off
to some far-flung place?

32:29.519 --> 32:32.397
Because you know if you can
make me seem like a bad mother,

32:32.480 --> 32:36.317
then how could anyone
possibly support me?

32:36.401 --> 32:40.112
That's not hardball,
that is just disgusting.

32:46.369 --> 32:49.163
Well, I have to say I do think
Ms. Dunbar has a point.

32:49.247 --> 32:50.456
I mean, speaking of hypocrisy,

32:50.540 --> 32:54.001
don't you send your own kids
to private school, Congresswoman?

32:58.423 --> 33:01.384
- Well, that wasn't my point. I--
- What was your point?

33:04.345 --> 33:06.680
Well, I was, um...

33:06.764 --> 33:09.308
My... My point....

33:15.856 --> 33:16.899
Um...

33:18.109 --> 33:21.446
John, I think I've said
all I need to say on this subject.

33:21.529 --> 33:25.241
All right, fair enough, Congresswoman.
Next question goes to you, Ms. Dunbar.

33:29.036 --> 33:30.621
Okay, guys, first poll is coming in.

33:30.704 --> 33:33.499
Most of them give
Frank Underwood the win. Not by a lot.

33:33.583 --> 33:36.835
But did he do enough to overtake Dunbar,
become the front-runner?

33:36.919 --> 33:40.089
George, I don't think it's so much what
Underwood did, but what he didn't do.

33:40.172 --> 33:41.507
He remained presidential.

33:41.591 --> 33:44.594
And when the attacks came his way,
he held the high ground.

33:44.676 --> 33:48.306
Now, Dunbar and Sharp, they came out
swinging, and I think it hurt them both.

33:48.389 --> 33:51.559
Yeah, but Sharp had to do something.
She's 20 points behind the other two.

33:51.642 --> 33:54.061
But the sexism thing?
And going after Dunbar's kids?

33:54.145 --> 33:56.814
- It seemed quite desperate.
- She did do some damage to Dunbar.

33:56.897 --> 34:00.109
I don't know about that.
Dunbar could've fared far worse.

34:00.192 --> 34:04.113
She took it on the chin, held her own,
and in my opinion, it was a tie.

34:04.196 --> 34:06.698
But bottom line,
does this debate change anything?

34:06.782 --> 34:09.619
Does it affect the caucus, does it
affect the primary in New Hampshire?

34:09.701 --> 34:11.621
We're still over a month out.

34:11.703 --> 34:13.414
And so a lot could change
in this process,

34:13.498 --> 34:16.208
but I do think the momentum
could shift in Underwood's favor.

34:16.292 --> 34:19.545
Let's not forget that it's remarkable
that a sitting president

34:19.629 --> 34:21.672
isn't considered
the front-runner to begin with.

34:21.755 --> 34:25.342
That's an excellent point. No incumbent
has ever had to fight back from this far--

34:32.266 --> 34:34.476
- Yes?
- He said she's not picking up, sir.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.603
Would you like me to have him
knock on her door?

34:36.687 --> 34:38.188
No, that's all right. Thank you.

34:53.036 --> 34:54.913
You haven't said a word.

34:59.210 --> 35:00.836
Well, you've been prepping for days.

35:00.919 --> 35:03.255
I thought you might want
a break from talking.

35:05.591 --> 35:07.510
You're disappointed in me.

35:08.511 --> 35:10.429
That the kids got mentioned.

35:12.473 --> 35:14.183
They're teenagers. They'll be fine.

35:14.266 --> 35:18.396
Probably thrilled...
that they got mentioned at all.

35:20.898 --> 35:24.652
If I'm disappointed in anyone, it's him,
for throwing you under the bus.

35:32.117 --> 35:34.078
I gotta fly back with you tonight.

35:34.161 --> 35:35.871
Don't you have events tomorrow?

35:35.954 --> 35:37.623
This is more important.

35:39.083 --> 35:40.501
What is?

36:06.193 --> 36:07.278
Thank you all for coming in.

36:07.361 --> 36:09.321
If you want to head
out this door right here.

36:10.489 --> 36:11.907
Thank you very much.

36:13.367 --> 36:17.580
All right, I'll give you some privacy.
This should only take 15 minutes.

36:17.663 --> 36:20.291
- So just holler out if you need anything.
- Thank you.

36:22.960 --> 36:25.170
Pull up a chair.
We can talk while this finishes up.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.426
I should be doing this, too.

36:32.219 --> 36:35.139
I'm sure we could
get another lawn chair in here.

36:35.222 --> 36:37.849
I can't.
I was a junkie once upon a time.

36:41.562 --> 36:44.523
What would you call this color?
Scarlet isn't right.

36:44.607 --> 36:46.191
It's not crimson or maroon.

36:46.275 --> 36:48.402
- Carmine.
- Carmine?

36:48.486 --> 36:50.946
- You must be a writer.
- Oh...

36:51.029 --> 36:53.907
No, I know that.
But you know she always tells everyone

36:53.991 --> 36:56.327
she bakes them herself
and I know she doesn't.

36:56.410 --> 36:59.371
That's local.

36:59.455 --> 37:01.873
Thank you for your support.
I'll see you when I get there.

37:01.957 --> 37:04.876
Is there some reason
we couldn't do this by phone?

37:04.960 --> 37:06.378
This needed to be in person.

37:06.462 --> 37:08.297
Yes, but you canceled all your events.

37:08.380 --> 37:09.923
I want to talk about the debate.

37:10.007 --> 37:12.968
You know, it wasn't the home run
we hoped for, but you did great, Jackie.

37:13.051 --> 37:15.262
She spent half the debate
on the defensive.

37:15.346 --> 37:18.474
- I humiliated myself.
- You got a little beat up, that's all.

37:18.557 --> 37:21.852
- And you threw the biggest punch.
- Oh, you mean the thing about your kids?

37:21.935 --> 37:23.270
That wasn't what we discussed.

37:23.354 --> 37:25.523
I had to hit you hard so she wouldn't.

37:25.606 --> 37:28.233
And besides,
we had to dispel any suspicion

37:28.317 --> 37:29.610
that you and I might be in concert.

37:29.694 --> 37:32.863
I'm not comfortable
with the dynamic we've established.

37:35.907 --> 37:37.702
What dynamic is that?

37:37.785 --> 37:39.911
The leash you have me on.

37:39.995 --> 37:43.624
How I'm supposed to roll over
and do any trick you want.

37:43.708 --> 37:45.876
You're taking me for granted.

37:47.085 --> 37:49.129
What, am I supposed to be, uh...

37:49.213 --> 37:52.508
appreciative of your
lackluster enthusiasm?

37:52.591 --> 37:58.723
How fortunate I am
to have you "sort of" on my team?

38:00.224 --> 38:03.268
You're not "happy" with our dynamic?

38:03.352 --> 38:06.271
Well, I'm not happy with your attitude.

38:06.355 --> 38:08.607
If anything,
you're taking me for granted.

38:08.691 --> 38:11.861
- Sir--
- We had a deal, Jackie.

38:11.943 --> 38:14.697
And I am perfectly willing
to hold up my end of the bargain.

38:14.780 --> 38:16.907
But do not be under any illusions.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.326
This is not a partnership of equals.

38:19.410 --> 38:20.952
Nothing close to it.

38:21.036 --> 38:25.457
If you are to be my vice president,
you will do what I ask.

38:25.541 --> 38:28.043
And we will not have this conversation

38:28.126 --> 38:31.714
every time you feel uncomfortable
with what I ask you to do,

38:31.797 --> 38:34.842
or how I choose to conduct myself.

38:35.676 --> 38:38.178
That's our dynamic.

38:45.603 --> 38:48.606
- Are we still sticking to the timeline?
- I'm sorry, I couldn't quite hear you.

38:48.689 --> 38:50.941
Are we still sticking to the timeline?
I drop out next week?

38:51.024 --> 38:52.443
I see no reason why you shouldn't.

38:52.526 --> 38:54.612
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- See you in Iowa.

38:56.906 --> 38:59.157
Why did you change your hair
back to blonde?

38:59.241 --> 39:00.992
That's your burning question?

39:01.076 --> 39:02.703
I'm curious.

39:04.496 --> 39:06.123
How does that help the book?

39:06.206 --> 39:08.793
Who knows? But right now, I got nothing.

39:10.168 --> 39:12.922
We changed it because blonde polls
better with the voters.

39:13.004 --> 39:14.381
We?

39:16.216 --> 39:18.594
There's a whole gaggle of people

39:18.677 --> 39:22.139
that weigh in on how you look,
and what you wear,

39:22.222 --> 39:27.018
whether an event calls for...
heels, earrings, no earrings.

39:27.102 --> 39:30.397
You hate it, don't you?
Campaigning?

39:30.481 --> 39:33.108
Everybody hates campaigning.

39:33.191 --> 39:35.820
Except for the politicians.
They feed off the energy.

39:35.903 --> 39:38.447
And their spouses.

39:38.530 --> 39:41.074
You think Francis feeds off me?

39:41.158 --> 39:43.911
You are literally giving your blood.

39:43.994 --> 39:46.622
Plenty of people give blood
who aren't married to politicians.

39:47.915 --> 39:51.502
Very few people campaign
for someone who just fired them.

39:54.546 --> 39:56.214
He tell you that?

39:56.298 --> 40:00.511
He said he betrayed you. Three days later,
you change your hair back to blonde

40:00.594 --> 40:03.889
and resign so you can, quote,
"devote yourself to the campaign."

40:05.390 --> 40:06.851
I did the math.

40:09.102 --> 40:11.271
You and Francis, you've....

40:12.982 --> 40:14.232
We've what?

40:18.320 --> 40:20.322
He's shared a lot.

40:21.657 --> 40:23.993
Does that bother you?

40:24.075 --> 40:25.494
Why would it?

40:26.411 --> 40:28.413
Another betrayal?

40:28.497 --> 40:30.415
No.

40:30.499 --> 40:32.083
You're...

40:38.048 --> 40:39.884
Are you okay?

40:39.967 --> 40:41.593
Just a little light-headed.

40:47.892 --> 40:49.226
- Here.
- Thank you.

41:00.905 --> 41:02.990
I was thinking.

41:03.073 --> 41:04.449
About what?

41:07.578 --> 41:08.954
Mrs. Underwood?

41:09.038 --> 41:10.288
Jumping.

41:12.499 --> 41:14.710
- Jumping?
- Mm.

41:14.793 --> 41:16.503
You ever have that feeling?

41:16.587 --> 41:19.256
- Conversation?
- Which feeling?

41:20.716 --> 41:24.720
On a bridge, you look over and...

41:26.764 --> 41:28.139
step back.

41:30.100 --> 41:32.644
Do you need me to get someone?

41:34.187 --> 41:36.189
He proposed and I said...

41:37.482 --> 41:39.109
I said seven years.

41:42.613 --> 41:45.824
If it's still good, another seven.

41:45.908 --> 41:47.451
If not...

41:50.079 --> 41:51.914
Every seven years.

41:55.667 --> 41:57.586
I don't hate campaigning.

41:59.129 --> 42:01.214
What I hate is...

42:05.844 --> 42:08.513
how much I need us.

42:08.597 --> 42:10.599
How much you need each other?

42:15.646 --> 42:18.107
I didn't jump.

42:18.189 --> 42:19.900
I didn't step back.

42:24.529 --> 42:26.531
I didn't...

42:26.615 --> 42:27.992
Mrs. Underwood?

42:30.828 --> 42:32.871
Hey!

42:32.955 --> 42:34.539
- What happened?
- She passed out.

42:34.623 --> 42:35.916
Let me see. Mrs. Underwood?

42:36.000 --> 42:39.044
Can you hear me? Mrs. Underwood?

42:39.128 --> 42:41.672
So all these three girls,
they got a different papi or what?

42:41.755 --> 42:45.509
They got the blonde, they got
the redhead, they got the brunette.

42:45.592 --> 42:48.971
- And that's Petticoat Junction, right?
- Sir?

42:49.054 --> 42:51.556
- May we speak privately?
- Oh, let me let y'all be.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.267
- You're in the middle of your story.
- Sir, if you don't mind.

42:54.351 --> 42:56.311
- Is it classified?
- No, it is not.

42:56.394 --> 42:58.355
Then talk.

42:58.438 --> 43:01.232
Jackie just stopped by my office.
She's upset.

43:01.316 --> 43:03.986
I think we need to take her views
more into consideration.

43:04.069 --> 43:07.698
- She's being ridiculous.
- I think she made some valid points.

43:10.117 --> 43:13.328
Who do you work for, me or her?

43:13.411 --> 43:15.664
I'm just trying to communicate
her concerns.

43:15.747 --> 43:17.875
She'd better get in line and so had you.

43:17.958 --> 43:20.002
I'm never gonna win
if I have to spend my time

43:20.085 --> 43:21.753
explaining myself to my subordinates.

43:21.837 --> 43:24.214
- Look, let me let you--
- No, no. Now, Freddy, sit down.

43:24.297 --> 43:27.509
Do you remember when we
talked about how you treat your staff?

43:27.592 --> 43:31.013
You want to win? You sure as hell
won't do it without any of them.

43:31.096 --> 43:33.223
You keep on like this,
you won't have any of them left.

43:33.306 --> 43:37.268
Are you talking about loyalty? The only
brand of that I accept is unconditional.

43:37.352 --> 43:40.814
- Anything less is a--
- Y'all should put this on pay-per-view.

43:40.898 --> 43:44.026
But you. You a big guy.
But this sucker,

43:44.109 --> 43:47.946
I've seen him go through
a rack of ribs like it was wet tissue.

43:48.030 --> 43:50.908
- Who'd you put your money on?
- Oh, I'm not gonna fall into that trap.

43:50.991 --> 43:53.410
- You.
- Sir? It's your wife.

43:53.493 --> 43:55.370
- She passed out giving blood.
- What?

43:55.453 --> 43:57.372
She's okay,
but, uh, Mr. Yates is on the line.

43:57.455 --> 43:59.791
I'll take it in my private study.

44:03.921 --> 44:06.423
Don't do no good
callin' a man out like that.

44:06.506 --> 44:11.053
It's like...
blamin' a snake for having fangs.

44:11.136 --> 44:13.597
- I couldn't help myself.
- Mmm...

44:13.680 --> 44:15.807
- Could you do me a favor?
- What's that?

44:15.891 --> 44:19.269
Cover for me.
I got work to do and he needs company.

44:19.352 --> 44:21.897
Back at the ribs joint,
I could just walk back in the kitchen

44:21.980 --> 44:24.066
when I got tired of hearing him talk.

44:24.149 --> 44:27.194
- Yeah. I'll tell him your boss came over.
- Thank you, brother.

44:43.835 --> 44:45.170
Put her on the phone with me.

44:45.254 --> 44:47.464
She didn't want me to call,
but I thought I should.

44:47.547 --> 44:50.217
- Well, is she nearby?
- I think she's embarrassed.

44:50.299 --> 44:52.052
I'm her husband.

44:52.136 --> 44:55.639
The nurses are with her. Maybe you should
just hold off for a few minutes.

44:55.722 --> 44:58.391
Tell the head of her detail
to get her on the plane right away.

44:58.475 --> 45:01.186
She has to come back here
and see the White House physician.

45:01.270 --> 45:04.648
My guess is she'd be even more embarrassed
if she had to cancel her events.

45:04.731 --> 45:07.609
This isn't about how she feels.
This is about what's best for her.

45:07.692 --> 45:11.196
She doesn't need a doctor.
She needs you.

45:11.280 --> 45:12.948
What do you mean?

45:13.031 --> 45:16.118
She said some things,
about every seven years.

45:16.201 --> 45:19.788
About being in limbo,
on the edge of a bridge.

45:19.871 --> 45:23.541
Listen, just because I may have shared
with you a few things about our marriage

45:23.625 --> 45:25.961
does not give you the right
to interfere with it.

45:26.044 --> 45:28.463
Now, please have her
call me when she's ready.

45:33.802 --> 45:36.805
Well... this is it.

45:36.888 --> 45:39.933
- Sixty days.
- Sixty days.

45:41.350 --> 45:42.936
That movie freaked me out.

45:44.521 --> 45:46.731
The whole world can fall apart
in sixty days.

45:48.399 --> 45:49.818
Or a guy can get sober.

45:49.901 --> 45:53.404
I washed my hands for ten minutes
last night before bed.

45:53.488 --> 45:55.657
You turned me
from an alcoholic to a germaphobe.

45:56.783 --> 45:59.119
That's not a bad trade-off.

45:59.203 --> 46:01.621
The 14 years I got by on my own...

46:02.706 --> 46:05.917
They mean nothing compared to the last
eight weeks you've been here with me.

46:06.001 --> 46:07.627
Well...

46:07.711 --> 46:09.921
You would have done the same for me.

46:10.005 --> 46:12.174
I'd like to think so.

46:14.009 --> 46:15.468
Know so.

46:18.347 --> 46:19.639
I love you, brother.

46:40.744 --> 46:42.704
Call me when you land.

46:42.787 --> 46:44.956
Jesus, you sound like Sarah.

46:58.511 --> 47:01.014
So we want to focus on ad-buys

47:01.098 --> 47:03.850
more in the Quad Cities market,
less so in Des Moines.

47:03.934 --> 47:07.687
You're stronger in the East and we want
to turn our twos there into ones.

47:07.771 --> 47:11.816
The "vision" message really resonated
in our focus groups post-debate,

47:11.900 --> 47:14.569
so I think we should cut
a new ad centered on that

47:14.652 --> 47:16.696
and weave it into the stump.

47:19.783 --> 47:21.159
Sir?

47:22.160 --> 47:23.203
I'm sorry, what?

47:23.287 --> 47:26.081
Are you good if we change the stump
to focus on the "vision" theme?

47:26.164 --> 47:28.417
I want to go to New Hampshire tomorrow,
first thing.

47:28.541 --> 47:29.876
We have you going to Iowa.

47:29.960 --> 47:31.628
I know, but I want
to change the schedule.

47:31.711 --> 47:35.715
In every campaign,
there comes a time for taking stock.

47:35.799 --> 47:38.135
A time for soul-searching. And...

47:38.218 --> 47:42.347
in the past 24 hours,
I have done just that.

47:42.431 --> 47:46.017
And the conclusion
that I have come to is this:

47:46.101 --> 47:50.563
If the goal is a safer,
more prosperous America,

47:50.647 --> 47:53.108
I don't need to run
for us to achieve that.

47:53.191 --> 47:57.988
All I need to do and what I encourage
all of my supporters to do

47:58.071 --> 48:02.033
is to help elect Heather Dunbar
to the White House.

48:03.410 --> 48:06.288
- Judas bitch.
- While I may be ending my camp--

48:12.377 --> 48:15.172
I'm just pissed off.
I'm sorry if I offended.

48:17.466 --> 48:19.717
Yeah, I wonder what she offered her.

48:19.801 --> 48:21.470
Nothing.

48:21.552 --> 48:23.472
Yeah, right.

48:23.554 --> 48:25.390
I know for a fact.

48:26.766 --> 48:28.393
You knew about this?

48:37.027 --> 48:38.945
You should call the president.

48:56.171 --> 49:00.549
"A very hairy, terribly scary
tarantula named Tina.

49:00.633 --> 49:03.136
I found her in a shoebox
in New York City.

49:03.220 --> 49:06.014
When I first saw Tina I shrieked..."

49:06.097 --> 49:07.516
Eek! Eek! Eek!

49:07.598 --> 49:08.808
Were you scared?

49:08.892 --> 49:11.061
Oh, I was terribly scared.

49:12.312 --> 49:14.523
"Tina had poked her head up
out of the left shoe..."

49:14.605 --> 49:17.942
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Shh... She doesn't either.

49:18.026 --> 49:21.029
"So there I was,
not knowing what to believe.

49:21.112 --> 49:25.075
Should I leave Tina in the shoebox
or set Tina free?"

49:25.158 --> 49:27.327
- Leave her in the box!
- Set her free!

49:27.411 --> 49:28.995
- Set her free!
- Leave her in the box!

49:29.079 --> 49:30.788
Oh, my goodness!
I don't know what to do!

49:30.872 --> 49:32.290
Nothing! Do nothing!

49:32.374 --> 49:34.751
Sir, Mr. Grayson
needs to speak with you.

49:34.834 --> 49:37.003
- Tell him I'll call him back.
- He says it's important.

49:37.087 --> 49:40.298
Later. I'm with my wife.

49:40.382 --> 49:42.800
I don't know what to do!

49:42.884 --> 49:44.802
You shouldn't do anything.

49:44.886 --> 49:47.431
- Let her out!
- Don't do anything?
