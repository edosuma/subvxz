WEBVTT

00:23.398 --> 00:25.650
- Watch him, watch him.
- I got him, I got him.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.319
Whoo!

00:28.570 --> 00:31.322
Oh, I got it! I got it! I got it! Johnny!

00:34.034 --> 00:36.161
Get out.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.916
I got it! I got it, Johnny!

00:42.375 --> 00:44.335
- No fair, no basket.
- What?

00:44.335 --> 00:46.629
You were out of bounds.
You stepped on the baseline.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.132
- Oh!
- Hey, guys, you play by rules or not,

00:49.132 --> 00:51.092
you stepped out of bounds.
I gave him a double dribble.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.927
Okay, fine. No basket.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.388
You don't have to call
a magnifying glass. All right? Let's go.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.223
What's a magnifying glass
got to do with it?

00:57.223 --> 00:58.725
The rule's enforced or it isn't.

00:58.892 --> 01:01.978
- Take the ball out, Larry.
- Here we go.

01:01.978 --> 01:04.105
Oh, I love that look you give, Nathan.

01:04.481 --> 01:07.108
- That big, toothy grin.
- Larry, enough.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.318
What's that grin mean?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.070
"He's white, so he's got to call
a ticky-tack to keep even?"

01:10.236 --> 01:11.321
Hey, you said it. I didn't.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.740
You want affirmative action
on the basketball court too, right Nathan?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.700
One set of rules for you
and one for everybody else.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.119
Larry, shut your mouth.
Take the ball out. Let's go.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.163
Come on,
what's everybody's problem today, huh?

01:20.288 --> 01:21.331
Check.

01:21.498 --> 01:22.791
- Let's go, let's go.
- Your ball.

01:22.791 --> 01:26.294
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Let's go.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.506
He ain't got nothing.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.217
I got this jump, I got this jump.

01:33.676 --> 01:34.886
- Foul!
- Foul?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.430
- Oh, man!
- That was clean, Larry.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.515
Yeah, sure.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.767
Hey, Nathan.

01:41.184 --> 01:44.229
I made 130,000 bucks last year.
How much did you make delivering' mail?

01:44.395 --> 01:46.231
Hey, man Larry,
I know a brother got made partner

01:46.231 --> 01:47.357
in your firm instead of you,

01:47.357 --> 01:48.942
but that's no cause
for you to bust my balls.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.985
You think that's what this is about?
You think I can't hold my own against you?

01:51.111 --> 01:53.113
Hey, I don't know what this is about.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.823
Why don't we just shut our mouths
and go back to playing.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.075
Or what? Nathan will gum up my mailbox?

01:57.075 --> 01:59.285
Hey, you gotta get out of my face.
Look, don't do that, man.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.037
- Or what?
- Hey, man, you lay your hands on me,

02:01.037 --> 02:02.580
I'm gonna show you.
I ain't playing with you, man.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.791
- That's all you're good for is playing.
- Back off, Larry!

02:05.875 --> 02:07.085
Man, what are you doing?

02:09.170 --> 02:12.132
- You all right?
- I can't believe I did that.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.466
Larry!

02:15.677 --> 02:17.387
What's going on?

02:18.179 --> 02:21.099
He's in full arrest. We need an ambulance.
John, my bag, there's a phone.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.228
- The red one?
- Yeah, the red one.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.194
Two, three...

02:33.194 --> 02:35.446
Yeah, this is Detective John Kelly
in 15 squad.

02:35.446 --> 02:38.908
I need Emergency Service
and an EMS for a possible cardiac,

02:39.159 --> 02:42.579
at the 63 Street YMCA,
second floor basketball court.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.330
Yes. Yes.

02:47.750 --> 02:48.793
What's going on?

04:02.742 --> 04:05.578
Twelve, 13, 14, 15.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.044
Nothing.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.423
Is he dead, Jerry?

04:19.342 --> 04:20.426
He's dead, isn't he?

04:24.389 --> 04:26.432
Yeah. He's dead.

04:28.685 --> 04:29.811
Oh, God.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.525
Kohnstam's a bachelor.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.319
Does anyone know his folks?

04:40.655 --> 04:43.491
I do. 206.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.410
What's that?

04:47.161 --> 04:49.539
The area code. They live in Seattle.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.753
What did he go off on me for?

04:56.879 --> 04:59.340
I don't know, man. I don't know.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.511
Come on. Come on. Come on.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.805
- He just started jumping me, man.
- I know, I know. I know.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.807
- What was wrong with him, man?
- I know.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.687
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna have to take you downtown.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.188
For what?

05:14.731 --> 05:16.316
They're gonna wanna talk to you.

05:16.816 --> 05:19.110
Talk to me about what?
John, you saw what happened.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.738
I know but you hit the guy. He went down.
They're gonna wanna talk about it.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.948
Screw you, John.
I'm not going down to that station.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.074
I'm going home.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.951
You're putting me
in a bad position here, Nathan.

05:27.368 --> 05:30.663
- What, am I under arrest?
- Put your voice down, will ya?

05:31.664 --> 05:34.250
Okay, let's go in there
and we'll take care of it.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.128
No. You arrest me.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.381
You arrest me. You arrest me
in front of our friends.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.218
All right. You're under arrest.

05:44.927 --> 05:46.554
You have the right to remain silent.

05:46.929 --> 05:49.807
You have the right to an attorney
at any time.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.726
If you cannot afford one,

05:51.726 --> 05:55.313
a lawyer will be supplied for you,
free of charge.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.482
Do you understand what I just said?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.444
Do you understand me?

06:02.653 --> 06:03.696
Yeah.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.407
I understand.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.594
Hi. Assistant District Attorney
Craig called.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.846
- He said he'd be a few minutes late.
- Oh.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.976
Hey, hey, hey.
Look who's here.

06:33.976 --> 06:37.647
- Mr. Giardella. Alphonse.
- There you go.

06:37.814 --> 06:41.234
I was about to fine you 25 cents,
for failing to use my first name.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.027
Fruit?

06:43.569 --> 06:46.030
Uh, no. No, thank you.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.866
So the DA's gonna be late, huh?

06:50.159 --> 06:51.577
Did you talk to him too?

06:52.495 --> 06:54.664
Yeah, I talk to Jimmy a lot.
Why shouldn't I?

06:55.456 --> 06:58.376
I gotta make sure he makes a jump
on everybody in his office.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.086
You too, Laura.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.506
Believe me, I know enough to make sure
everybody looks good.

07:03.881 --> 07:07.301
I know Mr. Craig feels your information's
been very productive.

07:08.010 --> 07:10.346
I got another confession
I wanna make to you right now.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.140
Why don't we wait on confessions

07:12.140 --> 07:14.517
until Mr. Craig gets here
and we're on tape.

07:14.517 --> 07:15.768
No, this is personal.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.813
You've been showing up
in my dreams lately.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.440
Who do you belong to anyhow?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.650
You got a husband
or an old man or something?

07:22.650 --> 07:25.027
I don't think
my social life is really relevant

07:25.027 --> 07:26.320
to what's going on in this room.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.656
Hey, believe me, what I've been
dreaming about,

07:28.656 --> 07:30.783
believe me, it's relevant.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.870
- Well...
- Good morning.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.290
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Me and Laura figured you were early.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.126
Shall we get started?

07:41.127 --> 07:42.962
Give me a second
to powder my nose.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.131
To be continued.

07:49.510 --> 07:52.388
- Where were you?
- I got stuck in traffic.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.681
I didn't.

07:56.392 --> 07:57.477
What does that mean?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.021
It means this is the third time this week
you've been late.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.440
Laura, if you have something
on your mind, say it.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.733
I feel like I'm being dangled

08:03.858 --> 08:06.360
in front of Alphonse Giardella
like a piece of meat.

08:08.112 --> 08:12.241
Am I upset that
this guy has half a crush on you? No.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.077
But that does not mean
I am pimping you out to him.

08:15.077 --> 08:17.455
It does not mean
I am showing up late

08:17.455 --> 08:19.832
as part of some strategy
to put your virtue at risk.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.462
And you're making another mistake
if you think I'm pleased

08:24.462 --> 08:26.506
the two of us are standing here
arguing about this.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.426
You asked me.
I'm telling you how I feel.

08:31.886 --> 08:36.307
What? What? What? Am I sensing a tension
in the atmosphere here?

08:36.891 --> 08:37.975
We're fine.

08:39.727 --> 08:40.728
Let's go work.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.378
- What's this?
- You got a minute?

09:10.258 --> 09:12.426
I play basketball
with this guy twice a week.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.554
He's a buddy of mine and, uh,

09:15.179 --> 09:18.057
He and another guy got into a beef.
The other guy is, you know,

09:18.057 --> 09:19.600
currently kind of a jerk.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.395
Getting in Nathan's face, pushing,

09:22.395 --> 09:26.232
and Nathan tried to walk away,
but the guy wouldn't give him any room, so

09:26.691 --> 09:29.360
finally, Nathan takes a slug at him,
the guy goes down dead.

09:31.028 --> 09:33.030
- What's his story?
- Ah, he's a good citizen, you know.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.283
He got in some trouble
when he was a kid, 18, 19...

09:35.491 --> 09:37.451
- What kind of trouble?
- No, it was a marijuana charge

09:37.451 --> 09:39.078
and failure to appear.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.080
I think, he did six months.
But he's clean, Lieutenant.

09:42.164 --> 09:45.293
And he's a mail carrier. You know,
he's a good guy. A family man.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.671
So, I read him his rights.
He's a little shook up.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.756
But I think
somebody else should be assigned.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.218
- Medavoy's up. I'll fill him in.
- Okay, I just need a minute with him.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.678
Yeah.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.391
- I can't do this, John.
- I know.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.809
- I can't go to jail, man.
- I know.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.312
I know, and I'll do my best
to make it easy on you, Nathan.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.063
But we gotta take a few steps here.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.940
- DA's gotta look into this.
- We got... What?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.525
This is Detective Medavoy.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.320
He's gonna handle the case
because I'm a witness.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.947
So you wanna make a statement,
you give it to him.

10:14.947 --> 10:18.034
I... I'm not gonna make any statement.
And I'm not gonna do anything.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.661
- I have to write up a statement.
- Well, what about me, man?

10:20.870 --> 10:24.832
Well, you're gonna be here for awhile
until the DA decides what to do.

10:25.082 --> 10:28.127
I'll put you in an interview room
while we, uh, interview the witnesses.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.838
- You gonna lock me up?
- Uh, in an interview room.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.007
Yeah, but he'll be able
to change his clothes in there...

10:33.007 --> 10:35.176
- Sure. Yeah.
- ...and get coffee? Yeah.

10:36.385 --> 10:40.473
- You're gonna lock me up?
- I gotta, man. I gotta lock you up.

10:43.893 --> 10:44.935
Go ahead.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.147
- I'll talk to you later.
- Sure you will.

11:05.915 --> 11:09.293
John, we got a homicide
in FDR at Pearl Street.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.628
You want me to grab Martinez?

11:11.253 --> 11:13.422
Nah. Let me just get some clothes.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.258
Listen, uh, did you get squared away
on your buddy?

11:17.343 --> 11:19.011
Yeah. I gave it to Medavoy.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.181
Look at this. I'm ankle deep
in water over here.

11:22.181 --> 11:24.141
Hey, it’s full of hair. I'm tellin' you

11:24.141 --> 11:26.644
somebody's hair
keeps cloggin' up the drain.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.397
You know, well, I guess that rules you out
as a suspect.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.944
Boy, that's really funny.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.905
Funny.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.458
Mr. Zimmer.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.211
I'm Detective Kelly.
This is Detective Sipowicz.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.005
- I know this is a hard time for you.
- She never hurt anyone.

11:55.005 --> 11:57.842
- Not as long as I knew her.
- You feel like answering any questions?

11:57.842 --> 12:00.177
We were just driving, just talking.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.930
Then I heard a noise.
Must've been the gunshot.

12:04.014 --> 12:07.518
I turned around
and Joan's bleeding all over her face.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.438
Next second I lost control
and crashed the car.

12:10.980 --> 12:11.981
She say anything?

12:12.648 --> 12:15.401
No. Half her head's gone.

12:16.026 --> 12:18.195
- You just heard the one shot?
- Ah, I think so.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.989
I don't know.
There might have been more.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.909
Did you notice any other cars
around you? Makes? Drivers?

12:24.118 --> 12:25.119
- No.
- No.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.246
Anybody driving erratically or anything?

12:27.496 --> 12:29.039
- No.
- Where were you headed?

12:29.623 --> 12:34.003
I was... headed to my mother-in-law's
to pick up the baby.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.006
God, what am I gonna say to her?

12:39.216 --> 12:42.261
She have any dispute at work?
A promotion? Raise?

12:42.261 --> 12:45.097
- Something like that?
- She's on maternity leave. No.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.224
How about you? Anybody mad at you?

12:48.142 --> 12:50.478
- No.
- What kind of business are you in?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.188
Electronic services.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.940
She's dead. She's dead.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.903
Let's go get your baby.
Come on, we'll get you a ride.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.030
Come on. Take your time.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.464
Crime Scene puts one bullet
in the right side of the woman's head.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.466
Pieces of a hollow point
and one bullet recovered

13:20.466 --> 13:22.551
from the seat back in front.
Nine-millimeter.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.346
Ballistics is pretty sure
it was a flat trajectory.

13:25.513 --> 13:27.056
The bullet's got to have come
from another car.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.059
- How does the husband check out?
- We're still pulling stuff in.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.519
The borough commander okayed

13:31.519 --> 13:34.021
a canvass of the motorists
off that exit ramp this morning.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.357
You'll have assistance
from the highway patrol cops,

13:36.357 --> 13:37.900
and you can use Martinez.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.069
The kid's making into an okay cop.

13:40.361 --> 13:43.072
Yeah. Don't give him any bad habits.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.995
I'm gonna meet you out there.
I'm gonna make Nathan's arraignment.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.080
No problem.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.958
Kelly, it's, uh, postponed
till this afternoon.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.459
The arraignment? How come?

13:55.584 --> 13:58.921
Eh, your friend punched out
a prison guard and then tried to run.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.091
They're fil...
filing, uh, supplementary charges.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.469
- Is the guard hurt?
- They said some stitches next to the eye.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.641
- Thanks for keeping me posted.
- Sure.

14:12.476 --> 14:13.519
Judy.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.980
Why did they postpone
Nathan's arraignment?

14:16.605 --> 14:20.359
Well, evidently, there was some kind of
altercation with a guard.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.070
- Between Nathan and a guard?
- Yeah, evidently.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.574
- I called you. You didn't get my messages?
- I got them.

14:27.992 --> 14:31.787
The district attorney said that
they're gonna charge him with homicide.

14:31.787 --> 14:35.124
No, that's just the category they use
when they go before the grand jury.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.334
Once the medical report is in,
I can testify...

14:37.626 --> 14:39.336
Is that supposed to reassure me?

14:40.588 --> 14:42.339
I can't be at the late arraignment,

14:42.798 --> 14:46.719
but I will definitely see Nathan later.
And if you get to talk to him in court,

14:47.177 --> 14:49.847
please tell him to calm down
'cause it's only gonna make it worse.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.933
He left yesterday morning...

14:53.642 --> 14:55.686
to go play basketball.

14:56.228 --> 14:59.732
I know. I'm sorry. Judy...

15:08.365 --> 15:10.534
For God's sakes, let's get this moving.
I gotta make a living.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.453
Morning.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.537
- Were you driving in this area...
- Come on!

15:13.537 --> 15:14.997
...about the same time yesterday?

15:15.122 --> 15:16.999
- I'm from Phoenix.
- Okay.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.001
- Were you here yesterday?
- No. I was in Indianapolis.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.253
- Let's go.
- What are you doing? Let's go!

15:21.253 --> 15:22.546
- Were you around here yesterday?
- Come on!

15:22.546 --> 15:23.631
- Did you see a shooting on accident?
- What... what are you on your

15:23.631 --> 15:25.257
lunch break? Let's go already!

15:25.257 --> 15:27.259
- No? Thanks.
- Come on, move it!

15:27.259 --> 15:28.969
This guy
with the horn's a pain in the ass.

15:28.969 --> 15:32.222
- Oh, man, come on!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:32.222 --> 15:34.975
How about you just relax there, pal?
We just wanna ask you a few questions.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.352
- Yeah, I heard, all right.
- Yeah.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.729
The answer's no, so go suck
on some doughnuts and get out of my way.

15:38.729 --> 15:44.610
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey, you... Come here!
- Andy, let's go.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.363
Andy, let him go.
We'll radio ahead. Andy...

16:08.509 --> 16:11.220
- Hands on the wheel!
- What the hell are you chasing me for?

16:11.428 --> 16:13.597
Step out of the vehicle
and give me your license and registration.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.765
What do you want? What do you want?

16:14.765 --> 16:15.849
- Get over there.
- All right. All right.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.601
- Give me your license and registration.
- Take it easy, take it easy.

16:18.769 --> 16:21.188
All right. Let's see your hands.
All right.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.107
Now, we're gonna talk
about that finger right there.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.651
The one in the middle that you were
sticking up in the air over there.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.027
Now, what was that all about?

16:27.027 --> 16:29.405
You know... You had traffic
all screwed up. I'm in a rush.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.908
Oh, okay, so you were trying to help, huh?
You were pointing at something

16:32.908 --> 16:34.827
that you thought would help
clear up the traffic.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.370
- Is that correct?
- Yes! Something like that.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.248
All right, then say so.
"I was trying to help."

16:39.248 --> 16:40.833
- I was trying to help.
- Okay.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.336
Now, I'm gonna ask you a few questions
about a shooting that happened yesterday,

16:44.336 --> 16:46.755
and then... then maybe we'll go
have some coffee

16:46.755 --> 16:49.008
- and, uh, suck on a doughnut, huh?
- I'm from Brooklyn.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.135
- I never left there yesterday.
- Oh, now, you see,

16:51.135 --> 16:54.346
I... I didn't even ask you
that question yet, Harvey.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.306
Now we're gonna have
to start all over again. I mean...

16:56.473 --> 16:58.600
- You do wanna help, don't you, Harv?
- Yeah, sure, sure.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.311
- All right then say so, "I want to help."
- I want to help.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.272
Good. Now, relax.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.859
This shouldn't take any more
than ten, 15 minutes.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.278
Half hour, tops.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.286
- Mr. Zimmer.
- What, you think I did it?

17:17.453 --> 17:20.581
- Hey, hey, whoa. Now, take it easy.
- Am I a suspect or what?

17:21.123 --> 17:22.750
You've been calling my friends,
my relatives.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.294
Mr. Zimmer, you conduct an investigation
by eliminating things.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.505
We're looking into every possibility
and motive for how your wife got shot.

17:28.505 --> 17:31.008
- I think you'd want us to do that.
- Nobody's singling you out.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.677
I mean, we're checking cars
off the highway, looking for witnesses,

17:33.677 --> 17:36.430
- checking into past shootings in the area.
- Making any progress?

17:36.638 --> 17:38.140
Anything comes up, we'll let you know.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.767
But I mean, I hope at least
you've ruled me out.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.768
I hope you got that far.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.353
- We'll keep you posted.
- Oh, that's great.

17:43.604 --> 17:44.980
I see my wife murdered in front of me.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.982
I got a three-month-old daughter.
I got to take care of.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.317
I'm to get my life back together.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.736
I've got to go through getting hounded
and persecuted by you people.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.493
That's a natural reaction, right?

17:58.577 --> 18:02.331
- So how come I make this guy a jerk?
- Kelly. Sipowicz.

18:02.915 --> 18:03.999
Give me a minute?

18:13.801 --> 18:16.136
Kelly and Sipowicz,
you know Licalsi and Lucas.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.429
- How you doing?
- Hey.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.932
Lucas and Licalsi
were working Street Conditions.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.226
They busted a couple of street dealers
who rolled

18:22.226 --> 18:24.186
and gave up the address
of a heroin cutting room

18:24.311 --> 18:25.521
and a scheduled drop.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.356
We're gonna pull a search warrant
and go for it.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.524
When would that be?

18:28.690 --> 18:31.652
The mechanics and baggers should be there
about ten o'clock tonight.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.654
Can everybody make ten o'clock work?

18:33.987 --> 18:36.865
- Sure. No problem.
- There goes my Wednesday Glee Club.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.125
I didn't ask for you. We just brought
the information...

18:46.125 --> 18:47.835
I got no problem working with you.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.255
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

18:52.756 --> 18:57.386
Okay.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.111
Cell 904 to visitors.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.711
- You can unhook him.
- He went after one of our guys.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.421
He wears iron as long as he's here.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.726
Here. I went by, uh, Vitello's.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.105
What you want here, man?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.317
I'm your friend, Nathan.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.069
Yeah,
you've been a big help so far.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.616
I'm also a cop.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.118
So this is about the hell
you've been through, John,

20:03.118 --> 20:04.203
walking that line?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.413
No, this is about you
and how you got to stop acting

20:06.413 --> 20:09.499
- like an asshole in here.
- I'm acting like an asshole?

20:09.958 --> 20:11.793
While you're sucking fresh air
and bringing me food

20:11.793 --> 20:13.003
like I'm a damn monkey in the zoo,

20:13.128 --> 20:14.338
and you're talking about
how I'm supposed to behave?

20:14.546 --> 20:15.714
Somebody's got to.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.550
And what was the point
of slugging this guard?

20:18.759 --> 20:21.511
- He put his hands on me.
- Okay, that is stupid, Nathan.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.430
That is acting like a con.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.266
Tell me the truth, John.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.727
If you had hit Larry,
would you be in here now?

20:28.727 --> 20:31.146
Better yet, if I was your brother,
would I be in here now?

20:31.688 --> 20:35.317
Nathan, I did what I thought I had to do
on the basketball court.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.528
But for the sake of argument,
let's just say I did let you down.

20:38.528 --> 20:40.864
Is that any excuse to throw away
the rest of your life?

20:41.114 --> 20:44.243
- My life has already been taken away.
- There is a lot we can do.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.495
You never meant to hurt Larry.
You were provoked.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.081
A grand jury, Nathan,
will probably see that.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.875
And it's no secret
Larry was a loudmouthed douche bag,

20:51.875 --> 20:54.294
may he rest in peace.
Plus, there's the guard.

20:54.419 --> 20:57.673
I'm gonna reach out to him
and maybe he will cut you some slack.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.595
- You think there's a chance of that?
- How bad was it between you two?

21:05.973 --> 21:07.432
I hit him. He got cut.

21:15.315 --> 21:16.692
You know, man...

21:18.902 --> 21:22.114
the last 13 years have been
like a dream or something, man.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.492
Judy and my babies...

21:26.827 --> 21:29.913
- the steady gig.
- It's no dream, Nathan.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.583
I want 'em back, man.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.256
I want 'em back.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.427
Okay, well, then you gotta stop
messing up in here.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.471
- You understand me?
- Yeah.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.100
You all right? You want the food?

21:53.854 --> 21:54.896
Um...

21:57.691 --> 21:58.984
just do me a favor, man.

22:02.487 --> 22:03.780
Get me out of here.

22:26.053 --> 22:29.389
This is the police! We have a warrant!
You have ten seconds to open that door!

22:29.556 --> 22:32.434
Eight, nine, ten! Hit it.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.644
Freeze! Police!

22:42.569 --> 22:43.862
Get on the ground!

22:49.576 --> 22:50.827
Gun!

23:01.004 --> 23:06.718
On the ground! On the ground!

23:19.481 --> 23:23.318
All right, you know the shooting technique
employed by Detective Kelly this evening

23:23.318 --> 23:25.028
isn't taught on the training range.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.656
Yeah. Yeah, no.
I... I developed it personally.

23:27.781 --> 23:30.325
- Yeah.
- This technique is known as, uh,

23:30.742 --> 23:32.577
"immobilization pattering." Right?

23:32.702 --> 23:35.705
Yeah, it requires complete control
and command of your weapon.

23:36.039 --> 23:39.209
The idea being that you peg shots

23:39.209 --> 23:41.461
around the body perimeter
of the perpetrator,

23:41.461 --> 23:43.630
causing him to freeze up
and become immobile.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.802
Yeah, it grew out
of watching hatchet-throwers...

23:49.970 --> 23:51.888
at carnivals when I was a kid.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.141
All right, I gotta make a trip. My round.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.394
- I'm out, Detective.
- No. Yeah?

23:57.394 --> 24:00.313
Yeah. My wife gets off shift
at the hospital so I'm gonna pick her up.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.816
- Okay, next time.
- Hey, good work tonight, man.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.067
- Thanks.
- Good work.

24:04.067 --> 24:07.195
All right, what... what,
you eat a lot of spinach, huh?

24:08.447 --> 24:10.240
- Night.
- See you later, Lucas.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.702
So, uh, what do you say?

24:18.582 --> 24:19.958
- Two more.
- All right.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.294
Couple of beers and another club soda.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.757
Well, I've been leaving you alone
like you asked me to.

24:28.049 --> 24:32.262
- Mm-hmm. And I appreciate it.
- But I've been thinking about you a lot.

24:33.930 --> 24:37.434
I've been thinking about you too.
I've been thinking that we should talk.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.604
That's been my inclination
for a while too.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.065
My marriage is over, so...

24:45.400 --> 24:48.695
you know, I've been alone too much,
and it would be nice to...

24:50.363 --> 24:53.116
- have somebody to be with and talk to.
- I know.

24:56.536 --> 24:59.956
See, the thing is, uh, with Marino
and the other dead guy aside,

24:59.956 --> 25:01.500
my problem is...

25:03.710 --> 25:06.171
You approached me
because he told you to, right?

25:06.296 --> 25:07.380
Okay.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.675
But we wound up in bed
because I wanted to be there.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.260
- And I wanna believe that.
- Believe it.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.765
What about the two dead guys in the car?

25:17.432 --> 25:18.934
They told me to kill you.

25:19.809 --> 25:23.271
I... I didn't feel like I had
any other choice but to do what I did.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.525
I'm not saying I didn't know that
there were other ways to go.

25:27.108 --> 25:30.987
But with the situation with my father,
I didn't feel like I could turn them in.

25:32.697 --> 25:35.408
- I've gone over and over this, John...
- All right, enough. All right. All right.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.995
I hear ya. I hear ya.

25:43.250 --> 25:47.087
I guess I could take forever
to make my mind up about us, huh?

25:47.879 --> 25:50.131
Meanwhile, our lives are going by.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.386
You take as much time as you need, John.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.556
I'm not going anywhere.

25:57.931 --> 26:00.392
- Nice collar, Sipowicz.
- Yeah, thanks.

26:00.892 --> 26:01.977
Hey. Andy.

26:05.105 --> 26:08.108
Bring 'em on.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.937
Oh, Lieutenant. Uh, canvass of motorists
yesterday you know about.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.272
- No progress?
- No.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.650
Uh, follow-up canvass
of the area's completed.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.861
No witnesses or information there either.

26:53.153 --> 26:56.615
On Gerald Zimmer, he's got decent credit,
no apparent money problems.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.742
His insurance, if anything,
he's underinsured.

26:58.950 --> 27:02.037
He had a term insurance policy
on himself for 200,000 dollars

27:02.370 --> 27:04.331
and 35,000 dollars on his wife.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.916
- Took those out in May.
- How would you proceed?

27:07.208 --> 27:08.627
Uh, if someone made me guess, I'd say

27:08.627 --> 27:10.420
it was a random potshot
from another vehicle.

27:11.087 --> 27:13.798
I suppose I'd work up requesting
information flyers for the neighborhood.

27:14.549 --> 27:15.925
I don't know what else there'd be to do.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.094
Work up the flyers.
Give 'em to the uniform force

27:18.094 --> 27:19.471
to distribute twice a week.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.642
All right. You guys,
put yourselves back on the wheel.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.352
- Good, kid.
- Start catching new cases.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.899
- Thanks for the help, Martinez.
- No problem, Lieutenant.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.234
I'm going over
to Nathan's grand jury hearing.

27:33.818 --> 27:35.820
- Listen, I hope all that works out.
- Thanks.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.530
- Martinez, you got that...
- Yeah.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.074
...that workup on the husband?

27:39.074 --> 27:40.825
- Yeah. I'll take care of it.
- Yeah.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.244
I wanna agitate this guy a little.

27:43.953 --> 27:44.954
What are you thinking?

27:44.954 --> 27:47.874
Uh, I don't know.
He rubs me the wrong way.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.585
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.509
Ah, Mr. Zimmer.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.638
Detective Sipowicz, 15 squad.
Yeah, how you doing?

28:03.014 --> 28:05.475
No, I wish I could tell you
that there was a breakthrough.

28:05.475 --> 28:08.353
We're, uh... We're just following up
on a few things here.

28:09.062 --> 28:13.942
Listen. We saw that you recently took out
an insurance policy on your wife.

28:14.275 --> 28:16.111
I wanted to ask you
was there a particular...

28:17.445 --> 28:21.241
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, Mr. Zimmer,
you wanna ease off on the profanity?

28:21.658 --> 28:24.744
I didn't... I didn't say that.
No one is accusing you of anything.

28:25.578 --> 28:28.665
No, no, we took notice
because you took out that policy

28:28.665 --> 28:30.041
on her pretty recently.

28:31.876 --> 28:36.631
Uh-huh. As a rider on your own policy,
virtually a freebie, ah.

28:37.590 --> 28:41.886
All right, I see. Yeah, well,
I suppose that... that might explain it.

28:42.929 --> 28:46.224
Hey, hey, Mr. Zimmer, now,
I'm talking to you in a respectful way,

28:46.224 --> 28:48.643
and I'm making legitimate inquiries here,

28:48.643 --> 28:50.019
so I don't know
what you're getting so excited about

28:50.019 --> 28:53.273
I mean, uh, you don't have anything
to hide, now, do ya?

28:55.108 --> 28:58.194
Yeah, you seem to fly off the handle
anytime anybody wants to talk to you.

28:59.279 --> 29:01.823
No. I didn't say you had anything to hide.

29:01.823 --> 29:05.410
I said if you don't,
I wonder why you're so irritable.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.999
All right, well,
I'm sorry you feel harassed.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.333
- Here you go.
- Yeah.

29:12.917 --> 29:16.045
I'll say goodbye now. All right. Yeah.
I'll be in touch.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.304
The other named witnesses
and myself were playing

29:24.304 --> 29:26.306
in a three-on-three basketball game.

29:26.639 --> 29:30.351
Most of us are close friends
and the game has been going on for years.

29:30.351 --> 29:33.354
This day, there was a dispute
over some calls.

29:33.897 --> 29:37.984
The deceased began pushing Mr. Foster
and had become verbally abusive to him.

29:38.777 --> 29:43.239
When Mr. Foster attempted to walk away,
the decedent continued to push.

29:44.073 --> 29:47.535
Finally, Mr. Foster punched him
in the face once.

29:47.952 --> 29:51.498
He went down to the floor
and immediately into arrest.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.335
He was pronounced officially dead
about 20 minutes later.

29:55.543 --> 29:57.962
Detective Kelly,
did you see the decedent assault

29:57.962 --> 30:01.758
or threaten Mr. Foster in any way,
prior to Mr. Foster striking the blow?

30:01.925 --> 30:06.095
The decedent was making racial remarks
and repeatedly pushing Mr. Foster.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.139
Did it appear to you
in your professional capacity

30:08.139 --> 30:11.518
that Mr. Foster was at risk
or felt himself to be at risk

30:11.643 --> 30:14.771
because of this pushing?
That he was attempting to defend himself.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.481
I don't think he was at risk.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.734
I think he was attempting
to fend off Mr. Kohnstam.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.736
I didn't ask if he was attempting
to fend him off.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.613
I asked you
if he was he defending himself?

30:24.155 --> 30:26.783
Okay, look, I wanna be very clear
about what happened here

30:26.783 --> 30:29.744
because I don't wanna cause these families
any additional undue grief.

30:29.869 --> 30:32.831
This was not a violent
or vicious confrontation.

30:33.456 --> 30:36.459
One man was being verbally provoked
and repeatedly pushed.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.628
He struck a blow in response to that.

30:38.628 --> 30:41.923
The result was out of all proportion
with the intent.

30:42.173 --> 30:46.636
I made the arrest because that's my job,
not because I thought I saw a homicide.

30:46.886 --> 30:49.722
But in answer to my specific question,

30:50.223 --> 30:52.141
your professional opinion
is that the blow,

30:52.141 --> 30:54.727
while it may have been provoked
by irritation or anger,

30:54.727 --> 30:57.105
was not struck in self-defense.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.025
Detective.

31:02.360 --> 31:05.905
- I suppose you could say that.
- You're excused, Officer.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.206
Hey, guys. How'd it go in there?

31:15.999 --> 31:19.210
- We'll see.
- You send the wreath to Seattle?

31:19.586 --> 31:21.880
Yeah. Yeah, I spoke to Kohnstam's mother.
They got it.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.508
- What was on the card?
-"He always had a big mouth."

31:26.134 --> 31:28.428
No, we just put
"With Sympathy" and all our names.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.889
- Where's Curly? We need him.
- Well, he said he'd be here.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.557
- Was Nathan in there?
- No, he's gonna be

31:32.557 --> 31:34.267
at the arraignment this afternoon
for the other charge.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.894
I'm gonna find this guard
he had the beef with.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.228
Okay, but please call Curly.

31:37.228 --> 31:40.064
- We need him here.
- He'll be here, John. He'll be here.

31:42.358 --> 31:43.818
- Call him again, will ya?
- All right.

31:50.491 --> 31:52.911
Mr. Zimmer, what's going on?

31:53.661 --> 31:55.914
What's going on is,
you're gonna stop badgering me.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.124
We're gonna put an end to the persecution

31:58.124 --> 32:00.376
and the subtle accusations
and the innuendo.

32:00.960 --> 32:04.547
That's a great vocabulary you got there.
Wanna tell me what's on your mind?

32:05.048 --> 32:07.050
I've taken a lie detector test, Detective.

32:07.467 --> 32:10.345
I'm giving you the results
and asking you to leave me alone.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.724
Norman Holmgren gave you the test, huh?

32:15.308 --> 32:17.018
I'm told your department
uses him regularly.

32:17.143 --> 32:19.062
Yeah, we do. He's a good examiner.

32:20.021 --> 32:23.316
Uh, why don't you come on upstairs
a minute, Mr. Zimmer.

32:23.566 --> 32:25.234
No, I think we've finished our business, Detective.

32:25.401 --> 32:29.656
Ah, come on. We can, uh, we can have
a cup of coffee while I look this over.

32:32.742 --> 32:35.328
Come on.
We'll be more comfortable up there.

32:35.787 --> 32:36.788
All right?

32:41.960 --> 32:44.545
Boy, you answered this test
with flying colors, didn't you?

32:44.671 --> 32:47.382
- Yes, I did.
- These needles didn't even budge.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.300
"Did you kill your wife Joan?
No.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.552
"Examiner's opinion,
subject answered truthfully.

32:52.053 --> 32:54.347
"Did you fire a gun? No.
Answered truthfully.

32:54.681 --> 32:57.558
"Were you involved in any way in a plan
to kill your wife? No.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.978
"Did you intend to kill your wife? No."

33:00.269 --> 33:03.856
-"Subject answered truthfully."
- Subject answered truthfully is right.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.858
All right, and can I go now?

33:06.025 --> 33:08.027
Hey, you're free to go
whenever you want, Mr. Zimmer.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.781
Suppose I set up a test,
now down at Police Plaza?

33:11.781 --> 33:13.324
Could you go downtown with me, Mr. Zimmer?

33:13.616 --> 33:15.535
- What kind of a test?
- Another lie detector test.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.495
- What for?
- Did you write out the questions

33:17.495 --> 33:18.871
on this test you just took?

33:19.163 --> 33:22.875
Look, this test was administered
by a reputable polygraph examiner.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.919
You still insist
on questioning my honesty?

33:24.919 --> 33:26.629
You insist on harassing me?

33:26.963 --> 33:28.840
You see, if it was me,
now, I'd have asked,

33:28.840 --> 33:31.509
"Do you know more about your wife's death
than you've told the police?"

33:31.509 --> 33:33.261
Now, that one
I definitely would've had on there.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.638
Read the report. I was not involved.

33:35.972 --> 33:38.349
What is tearing you up inside,
Mr. Zimmer, huh?

33:38.808 --> 33:41.269
What... what are you doing here?
What do you need to tell me?

33:41.394 --> 33:42.520
I don't need to tell you anything.

33:42.770 --> 33:46.107
Now, look, I'm not here
to judge you, Mr. Zimmer.

33:46.941 --> 33:48.526
Maybe you were fooling
around on your wife.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.028
Is that what we're talking about, huh?

33:50.445 --> 33:52.739
Did you maybe have
a jealous mistress did this

33:52.905 --> 33:54.532
and you didn't know anything
that she had planned?

33:54.532 --> 33:56.659
That'd give you the clear polygraph test

33:56.784 --> 33:58.786
and that'd make you feel
real terrible now.

33:58.786 --> 34:00.538
- Oh, my God.
- Is that what we're talking about?

34:00.538 --> 34:02.498
I did it! I killed her!

34:03.666 --> 34:06.210
Okay, now, uh, Mr. Zimmer.
Now, I'm informing you right now

34:06.461 --> 34:07.462
that you have a right to an attorney.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.213
- You don't understand.
- You be quiet a second.

34:09.756 --> 34:12.383
Now, if you don't want an attorney,
I have to hear you decline.

34:12.592 --> 34:15.678
I decline an attorney. I decline.

34:18.931 --> 34:22.101
- Tell me how you killed her.
- She begged me.

34:22.769 --> 34:24.353
She begged me to stop.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.065
- I still killed her.
- What did you do?

34:28.149 --> 34:30.818
A man passed me. He cut me off.

34:31.527 --> 34:32.945
This is on the FDR Drive?

34:33.154 --> 34:36.157
The son of a bitch, he cut me off
and he got in front of me.

34:36.282 --> 34:40.078
So I came up on the inside
and I cut back in front of him.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.288
I cut him off the way he cut me off.

34:43.247 --> 34:45.666
And then this kept on for a while.

34:45.666 --> 34:49.754
He tried to pass me. I sped up
and trapped him inside of another car.

34:49.754 --> 34:53.257
I guess he got behind me
and I slowed down and trapped him again.

34:53.841 --> 34:57.220
And he's blinking his lights.
He's making obscene gestures and so on,

34:57.220 --> 35:01.891
and she's screaming at me to stop.
But, I lost my temper.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.477
And he came up on the inside, I sped up

35:04.936 --> 35:07.271
and tried to trap him again.
And the next thing I knew...

35:13.402 --> 35:15.029
You know the last thing she said to me?

35:16.948 --> 35:19.117
"Your wife and the mother
of your child is in this car.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.493
"Will you please stop?"

35:22.411 --> 35:24.831
And then, I heard a gunshot,

35:25.832 --> 35:28.334
and my wife's face is covered with...

35:29.877 --> 35:31.045
blood.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.843
Can you help us with the guy?

35:38.553 --> 35:40.304
Yes. I... I saw him.

35:42.723 --> 35:43.891
I got the license plate.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.478
I was too ashamed to tell you.

35:57.029 --> 35:59.407
- Yeah. No.
- You got him?

35:59.615 --> 36:00.867
- Thanks a lot.
- Got him.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.579
- Is that the guy who wasted Zimmer's wife?
- And the gun.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.873
So, how'd you make out with Nathan?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.500
Grand jury didn't indict.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.753
Medical Examiner found
a dissecting aneurysm.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.131
What's that in English?

36:15.298 --> 36:17.550
The poor bastard's aorta blew up
like a cheap balloon, Andy.

36:17.550 --> 36:20.178
- He could've died coughing.
- So your pal's off the hook.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.388
Except for the assault
on the corrections officer.

36:24.682 --> 36:25.808
Kelly.

36:27.101 --> 36:30.313
Yeah. Okay. I'll be right there.
I'll be back.

36:38.571 --> 36:39.989
- You Kelly?
- Yeah.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.366
I'm Hardwick, Corrections.
What can I do for you?

36:42.575 --> 36:45.036
- How's the eye?
- Couple of stitches, headache.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.413
- I've been there before.
- Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.458
Why? You don't have the paper on it.
It's in the 5th Precinct.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.127
Yeah, I know.
And I spoke to Detective Lugo

36:53.127 --> 36:54.879
and he knows that I reached out to you.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.470
- Nathan Foster is a friend of mine.
- The guy who hit me?

37:02.678 --> 37:04.847
Yeah. I wanted to see
if I can explain things to you.

37:04.847 --> 37:08.601
Like what? He's sorry? He didn't mean it?
He'll never do it again?

37:08.809 --> 37:12.605
He's a postal worker and a family man,
and he's living a clean life.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.024
Me too. I got all those things too.

37:15.524 --> 37:17.652
Does that make it okay for me
to take a piece out of you?

37:17.902 --> 37:20.321
You're pissed off.
I understand that. I would be too.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.865
I looked this guy up.
He's been in jail before.

37:22.865 --> 37:25.868
As a teenager.
My point is, the guy was no virgin.

37:25.868 --> 37:28.788
He knew how it works.
He broke the big one.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.166
He hit the "man."
And I ain't here to be hit or damaged.

37:32.959 --> 37:36.504
- I know that and he does too.
- You're sure of that, huh?

37:36.754 --> 37:38.631
You know what's in this guy's mind?

37:39.590 --> 37:43.678
Hardwick, this guy was looking
at his whole life going down the drain.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.388
He went off for a second.

37:45.513 --> 37:48.015
Now, the charges that brought him in
have been dismissed.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.394
Do you think you can find it
in your heart to cut him a break?

37:52.853 --> 37:54.021
See you in court.

38:03.572 --> 38:05.408
Okay, Mr. Zimmer, now,
whenever you're ready.

38:05.408 --> 38:08.244
If, uh, if you recognize anyone,
just give us his number.

38:19.630 --> 38:23.884
- Four. Number four.
- How do you know this man?

38:25.219 --> 38:27.471
- That's the man that shot my wife.
- You're sure?

38:28.264 --> 38:29.390
I'm sure.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.184
Get a DA. Start the paperwork.

38:32.601 --> 38:35.438
Hell of a job.
Thanks for your cooperation.

38:38.232 --> 38:39.692
Okay, Mr. Zimmer, come on let's go.

38:39.984 --> 38:42.153
Just, uh, let me have a minute, all right?

38:42.361 --> 38:43.738
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.282
All right.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.752
- You killed my wife!
- Hey, Mr. Zimmer!

38:57.960 --> 39:02.423
You killed my, you...

39:02.423 --> 39:03.716
You shot her in face!

39:03.716 --> 39:05.801
Well, you should have pulled over
and let me pass.

39:05.801 --> 39:07.845
I got as much right to be
on that road as you do.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.430
Up yours, pal.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.182
- You son of a bitch!
- Hey!

39:11.432 --> 39:14.310
You guys want me to get a couple
of those kiddie car steering wheels

39:14.310 --> 39:17.605
and you can go at it again, huh?
Is that what you want?

39:24.111 --> 39:26.280
Officer, do you swear
to the truth of the affidavit?

39:26.822 --> 39:27.823
I do.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.825
Charges are felonious assault and escape.

39:29.825 --> 39:32.495
Your Honor, the People have agreed
to drop the charge of escape.

39:32.828 --> 39:34.121
Motions as to the assault?

39:34.372 --> 39:36.957
- The People wish to proceed as a felony.
- Objection, Your Honor.

39:37.166 --> 39:40.127
Uh, I'll schedule a hearing
for late next week.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.422
Bail is 20,000.
Can you make that, Mr. Foster?

39:44.507 --> 39:46.008
No, I cannot, Your Honor.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.429
Um, can I say something, Your Honor?

39:51.222 --> 39:52.598
I'll give you a minute's grace...

39:53.015 --> 39:56.185
and advise you and your attorney
that any statements are for the record.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.104
Thank you, Your Honor.

39:59.146 --> 40:01.107
Uh, I was involved

40:01.524 --> 40:04.652
in a fight with a friend a few days ago,
and he died.

40:04.652 --> 40:08.364
No, you face no charges here
but assault on a prison guard, Mr. Foster.

40:08.364 --> 40:09.740
Yeah, I know that, Your Honor.

40:10.282 --> 40:11.784
And as much as I would like,

40:12.326 --> 40:15.913
I can't relive that day
or bring that person back,

40:16.497 --> 40:19.875
even though the grand jury found
that it wasn't my fault.

40:20.751 --> 40:24.380
Then, uh, this man, the guard,

40:24.713 --> 40:27.049
who was just doing his job, Your Honor.
I understand that.

40:28.634 --> 40:32.847
But he was putting me back into a life,
I felt I had earned my way out of...

40:34.765 --> 40:38.185
and I got very scared,
and I tried to get away.

40:40.062 --> 40:41.564
Now, I should've never hit him.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.108
And for that, I am deeply sorry.

40:45.526 --> 40:46.610
I apologize.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.366
But, Your Honor, I'm asking...

40:55.244 --> 40:56.787
can I have my family back?

40:59.248 --> 41:00.666
Can I have my life back?

41:03.252 --> 41:05.045
I've tried very hard to make a life.

41:08.507 --> 41:09.758
Please.

41:23.898 --> 41:26.192
Your Honor, the People are willing
to reduce the charge

41:26.484 --> 41:30.237
to misdemeanor assault,
and they have no objection to parole.

41:31.363 --> 41:33.115
Paroled, pending a hearing or plea.

41:35.409 --> 41:38.370
- Great.
- Thanks so much for your help.

41:38.370 --> 41:39.997
Congratulations.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.131
- Thanks.
- Okay.

42:26.752 --> 42:28.462
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

42:28.587 --> 42:31.549
It's been five weeks
since my last confession.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.716
These are my sins.

42:33.926 --> 42:36.971
For your own good,
which is God's glory,

42:36.971 --> 42:39.348
I think you should try to get in here
a little more often, hmm?

42:41.642 --> 42:43.769
This situation
that you're familiar with...

42:45.479 --> 42:46.897
I'm glad it's resolved.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.818
Well, starting off
with a death the way it did,

42:50.818 --> 42:53.946
that was terrible enough.
It didn't need to get any worse.

42:56.365 --> 42:59.994
I wanted to talk to you
about something else.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.371
Uh-huh.

43:05.165 --> 43:07.543
I know the church still regards me
as married,

43:08.127 --> 43:11.964
and I've been working on it,
you know that.

43:13.549 --> 43:14.883
But it's not gonna work out.

43:15.759 --> 43:17.303
Why?
Are you interested in someone else?

43:18.554 --> 43:19.722
I'm not sure.

43:21.432 --> 43:22.683
I mean, yeah, I am.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.769
The doctrine is to work
on your marriage.

43:26.186 --> 43:27.187
And I have been.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.983
But Laura and I know that...

43:32.651 --> 43:33.819
it's not gonna work.

43:35.279 --> 43:39.158
Well, involvement
with this other woman, is it, uh...

43:39.700 --> 43:42.703
The other woman, in terms
of my romantic interest for her,

43:42.703 --> 43:44.330
I don't wanna talk about that right now.

43:44.330 --> 43:45.998
I mean, in what terms then?

43:49.251 --> 43:50.628
Well, she's a good person.

43:52.546 --> 43:54.256
But certain events have taken place,

43:54.256 --> 43:57.676
and she's ended up doing something
that most people would think is wrong.

43:57.968 --> 43:59.136
Do you think it's wrong?

44:01.513 --> 44:03.474
- Yeah, I do.
- Does she?

44:05.684 --> 44:08.604
So far she seems okay with it.

44:09.313 --> 44:11.065
Well, if she's the good person
you say she is,

44:11.065 --> 44:12.608
she can't be okay with it. You know that.

44:12.608 --> 44:15.194
- I don't know that.
- Well, I think that's why you're here.

44:16.945 --> 44:20.741
- Well, what exactly did she do?
- I don't wanna talk about that.

44:20.908 --> 44:23.285
- What? A venial sin? A mortal sin? What?
- I can't say.

44:23.535 --> 44:25.371
I'm your priest.
What do you mean, you can't say?

44:25.537 --> 44:26.622
I can't say.

44:26.622 --> 44:27.790
Yeah. Well then
why don't you come back here

44:27.790 --> 44:29.708
when you're ready to stop acting
like a tube steak.

44:35.172 --> 44:37.257
John.

44:39.009 --> 44:43.889
I, uh, expressed myself inappropriately,
and, uh, I regret it.

44:45.849 --> 44:49.520
Because you're my friend,
you have a special way of pissing me off.

44:51.730 --> 44:52.773
I know.

44:55.943 --> 44:57.277
You see, in there,

44:58.112 --> 45:00.864
I'm God's priest and an intermediary.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.493
You come to confession with God...

45:06.912 --> 45:08.247
you come with an open heart...

45:10.249 --> 45:13.001
which, uh, I know you can do.

45:15.254 --> 45:18.048
- I'll keep working on it.
- I know you will.

45:22.052 --> 45:23.220
Ah!

45:23.512 --> 45:25.389
- Hello, Father.
- Gladys, hi.

45:26.724 --> 45:29.893
You know, I do believe
I have a special vocation for the game.

45:31.228 --> 45:35.441
Curly, I think you have a special vocation
for everything you do.

45:38.235 --> 45:40.738
We might as well start
with a little two-on-two.

45:40.863 --> 45:43.657
- Nathan won't show.
- Oh, come on, man. Let's wait awhile.

45:44.742 --> 45:45.784
He will be here.

45:47.035 --> 45:49.621
- What makes you think so?
- Because I think so.

45:50.247 --> 45:53.917
Even if he shows up, we'll need a sixth.
We'll never find the right guy.

45:53.917 --> 45:57.296
Hey, doc, let me ask you something.
You ever have a positive thought?

45:57.296 --> 46:01.049
Eh, cancer specialists don't tend
to be optimists.

46:01.049 --> 46:03.093
Hey, hey. Look who's here, guys.

46:03.093 --> 46:05.512
Hey, guy.

46:05.637 --> 46:07.264
- Nathan.
- Hey, how you doing?

46:07.264 --> 46:09.141
- It's good to see you.
- Thanks. You too, man.

46:09.141 --> 46:11.602
- What's happenin'?
- Good to see you.

46:12.853 --> 46:14.146
Hey, what's up, bub?

46:16.315 --> 46:19.026
- Whose side you on?
- Against you.

46:19.318 --> 46:20.444
For a little while anyway.

46:21.987 --> 46:23.155
We need a sixth man.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.783
Hey, fella, you play?

46:26.158 --> 46:27.618
Nah, not very well.

46:28.577 --> 46:29.828
But that never stopped you guys.

46:29.953 --> 46:32.873
Oh! Come on.

46:32.873 --> 46:33.957
He's gonna be hurt.

46:34.416 --> 46:35.959
We'll take him. He'll fit right in.

46:37.044 --> 46:39.838
- Check it out. Check it out.
- Check it out. Check it out.

46:39.838 --> 46:42.299
Give it back, give it back.
Check it out, one more time.

46:42.299 --> 46:44.885
One more check. Give it one more check.

46:45.719 --> 46:46.720
Watch this fool.

47:15.123 --> 47:17.501
- Hey.
- Hey.
