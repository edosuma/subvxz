00:00.240 --> 00:01.741
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.776 --> 00:03.743
My "Mom's the Word" blog,
they want to publish it!

00:03.778 --> 00:06.312
A book tour?

00:06.380 --> 00:07.880
<i>Adrian, take charge!</i>

00:07.914 --> 00:09.434
<i>His breeder
said he's a problem.</i>

00:09.449 --> 00:11.750
<i>If you're not
up for the job...</i>

00:11.818 --> 00:14.153
I know somebody who might be.

00:14.221 --> 00:16.622
<i>I'd like you to work with Zeus.</i>

00:16.657 --> 00:18.991
<i>Amy, with Zeus on her own?</i>

00:24.263 --> 00:25.463
- Hey.
- Ty?!

00:25.531 --> 00:27.900
Adrian...

00:27.934 --> 00:28.901
It was Adrian
in the stable that night.

00:28.935 --> 00:30.402
I saw him running away!

00:32.604 --> 00:34.673
You have the greenest eyes.

01:18.950 --> 01:21.885
Hey, that was some dream.

01:24.021 --> 01:27.057
It felt so real.

01:27.125 --> 01:28.392
Are you okay?

01:29.861 --> 01:31.394
Yeah. Yeah?

01:33.597 --> 01:36.800
I'm much better now.

01:36.834 --> 01:39.803
I could really get used to you
living in the attic.

01:42.173 --> 01:43.940
How about breakfast in bed?

01:43.975 --> 01:44.875
Think you could
get used to that?

01:44.909 --> 01:50.012
Ty... This might
sound crazy, but...

01:50.046 --> 01:53.449
I've spent way too much time
in bed.

01:53.484 --> 01:56.386
I think what I really need
is to get back to work.

02:06.496 --> 02:08.363
Honey, I can do that.

02:08.398 --> 02:09.631
Yeah, but I'm doing
it so you don't have to.

02:11.367 --> 02:12.968
You mean in case I might have
something else going on today,

02:13.003 --> 02:16.972
like, I don't know,
a book tour?

02:17.007 --> 02:19.140
You just read my mind.
It's amazing.

02:19.175 --> 02:22.076
Except I'm still not
sure if I want to go.

02:22.111 --> 02:24.579
Well, you don't
have to decide right now.

02:24.614 --> 02:25.747
There's plenty of time to pack.

02:25.782 --> 02:27.916
Or not.

02:27.950 --> 02:30.585
Or not, right, but
the plane to Toronto

02:30.620 --> 02:31.953
leaves in four hours
and fifty minutes.

02:31.987 --> 02:35.089
I'm just saying.

02:39.628 --> 02:41.129
Hmm. Scooch over.

02:43.065 --> 02:45.333
So, what did you decide?

02:45.367 --> 02:47.135
About what?

02:47.169 --> 02:49.170
Okay, fine, be that way.

02:49.238 --> 02:50.972
But for what it's worth,
I think you should go.

02:51.006 --> 02:52.473
Everyone'll be fine here.

02:52.507 --> 02:55.710
Everyone maybe,
but what about you?

02:55.744 --> 02:57.411
Way to hog the sink!

02:57.446 --> 02:59.046
Okay, this is getting crazy.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.581
You know what? You're right.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.115
I don't need to brush my teeth.

03:02.150 --> 03:03.417
I brushed 'em yesterday.

03:03.452 --> 03:06.754
Uh? Unh unh unh! Unh-unh.

03:07.389 --> 03:08.355
Fine!

03:12.493 --> 03:14.261
Have another bite, honey.

03:16.164 --> 03:17.485
Aren't you cutting it
a bit close?

03:17.498 --> 03:18.598
Tell me about it.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.699
What's going on with Lou?

03:19.767 --> 03:20.868
She's still on the fence.

03:20.935 --> 03:22.069
Well, that's ridiculous.

03:22.103 --> 03:23.436
Her plane leaves in four hours!

03:23.504 --> 03:25.137
Yeah, give or take.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.540
If she thinks she's gotta
stay here to look after Amy,

03:27.608 --> 03:28.908
you tell her to forget it.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.209
She's done being a patient.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.911
She's already talking
about getting to work.

03:31.945 --> 03:32.785
Yeah, starting today.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.957
Morning!

03:45.025 --> 03:46.692
Amy? Amy, what's wrong?

03:48.695 --> 03:50.562
<i>Are you okay?</i>

03:50.630 --> 03:51.998
Yes, Lou, I'm fine.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.936
Don't you have a plane to catch
or something?

04:02.542 --> 04:05.343
Amy, why are you
pushing yourself?

04:05.378 --> 04:07.212
Why don't you just
take it easy?

04:07.280 --> 04:08.914
Because taking it easy
has been driving me crazy.

04:08.981 --> 04:11.683
I'm fine, really.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.619
I'd believe you if I didn't
do the same thing to you.

04:13.686 --> 04:15.353
What do you mean?

04:15.421 --> 04:19.656
After my motorcycle wreck, I lied
to you about how I was feeling,

04:19.725 --> 04:20.757
I didn't want you on my case.

04:20.826 --> 04:23.795
I didn't want you
worrying about me.

04:23.829 --> 04:27.165
Good to know.
That's not what I'm doing.

04:37.042 --> 04:39.009
<i>Zeus!</i>

04:40.746 --> 04:41.986
What's wrong?!
What's wrong?!

04:42.013 --> 04:44.415
The horses!

04:44.450 --> 04:46.150
Amy, the horses are fine.

04:48.453 --> 04:51.088
What's going on? What is it?

04:51.122 --> 04:52.990
I don't know, sometimes...

04:53.024 --> 04:55.459
I just feel like...

04:55.493 --> 04:57.761
Is it the accident?

04:57.795 --> 04:59.196
Is that what
you're talking about?

04:59.230 --> 05:01.098
Yeah, like it's happening again
and I'm right there and-

05:01.132 --> 05:03.267
no, you're not there.

05:03.335 --> 05:05.869
You're right here with me,
okay?

05:05.903 --> 05:07.838
I know. It's no big deal, Ty.

05:07.872 --> 05:10.006
All right.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.541
Just run it by Dr. Virani,
make sure she-

05:11.576 --> 05:14.177
no, please don't...
Don't anyone anyone, okay?

05:14.211 --> 05:16.379
Especially not Lou,
don't tell Lou.

05:39.068 --> 05:41.370

06:04.860 --> 06:06.194
I've got no big deadlines.

06:06.229 --> 06:10.598
My boss knows that I'll be working
remotely, or cyber commuting,

06:10.633 --> 06:11.766
or whatever you want
to call it,

06:11.800 --> 06:14.120
and, you know, I'm not gonna
leave home until you get back.

06:14.136 --> 06:16.504
Okay. Except so far
I'm not going anywhere.

06:16.539 --> 06:18.506
Well, if you wanted to, though.

06:18.574 --> 06:21.342
If you wanted to, honey,
I would make it work.

06:21.376 --> 06:23.144
Great. I'm
committed to making it work.

06:23.178 --> 06:24.979
Babe, you're
kinda pressuring me.

06:25.047 --> 06:27.814
Do you want to go or not?

06:27.849 --> 06:31.018
Of course! But, honey,
seriously, how can I?

06:31.086 --> 06:32.786
Amy obviously hasn't
fully recovered yet,

06:32.854 --> 06:35.456
and who's gonna cook for her?

06:35.490 --> 06:39.460
Who is gonna make sure
that she gets enough rest and...

06:39.528 --> 06:40.928
I'm sorry, but I just-
I can't get over the fact

06:40.995 --> 06:42.396
that she could have died!

06:42.464 --> 06:45.032
<i>But I didn't die, Lou,</i>

06:45.066 --> 06:47.167
and I'm not planning on it
anytime soon.

06:47.234 --> 06:49.369
I'm feeling good, okay?

06:49.437 --> 06:52.039
Just ask Ty.
I helped him feed and water.

06:52.106 --> 06:54.207
Lou...

06:54.275 --> 06:56.242
You worked hard
on this book deal, okay?

06:56.310 --> 07:01.448
So whatever you decide, don't make
me the reason that you don't go.

07:01.515 --> 07:03.716
Amy's right, honey. I mean...

07:03.784 --> 07:04.584
It's not like
you're going to Mars.

07:04.651 --> 07:06.419
It's just a book tour.

07:06.487 --> 07:07.727
You can always come home,
right?

07:07.754 --> 07:10.356
Okay, okay!

07:10.424 --> 07:12.058
You guys obviously both
just want to be rid of me.

07:12.926 --> 07:13.793
Fine. Good.

07:18.832 --> 07:21.333
What's up, stranger?

07:21.401 --> 07:23.669
Feels like ages
since the last time we talked.

07:23.737 --> 07:25.004
Been busy.

07:25.072 --> 07:27.306
Busy.

07:27.340 --> 07:30.142
That sounds like cowboy code
for "my ex-wife's in town."

07:30.210 --> 07:32.344
Now how did you hear that?

07:32.412 --> 07:34.213
Oh, it's a
teeny tiny little town

07:34.247 --> 07:36.948
and people with
a lot of big mouths.

07:36.983 --> 07:38.683
Did those big talkers
tell you that she's gone?

07:38.751 --> 07:40.619
<i>Really?</i>

07:40.653 --> 07:42.887
No, I guess
I must have missed that part.

07:42.955 --> 07:45.524
So what happened?

07:45.558 --> 07:48.160
I don't know.
Figure she's in Vancouver.

07:48.194 --> 07:51.730
O-kay, that's way
too much information.

07:53.065 --> 07:55.033
I'm kidding.

07:55.067 --> 07:56.101
Let's just say after having
my heart ripped out

07:56.135 --> 07:57.636
for the second or third time,

07:57.670 --> 08:01.205
I'm done with long-term relationships...

08:01.240 --> 08:04.475
At least for
the foreseeable future.

08:04.510 --> 08:07.578
I am totally on
the same page with you.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.847
Finally...

08:09.881 --> 08:11.115
We have something in common.

08:14.019 --> 08:15.620
Yes, we do.

08:18.590 --> 08:20.424
Okay, so you
have my to-do list.

08:20.459 --> 08:21.825
I've got it,
honey, right here.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.127
I just feel like I'm
forgetting something.

08:23.161 --> 08:26.329
It
doesn't feel like it!

08:26.364 --> 08:28.198
Amy, you have to promise
me you are not gonna overdo it,

08:28.232 --> 08:30.000
you'll take it easy.

08:30.035 --> 08:31.501
I promise.
Everything will be fine.

08:31.536 --> 08:33.203
Okay.

08:33.236 --> 08:35.706
You, give me a big hug.

08:35.740 --> 08:38.042
- Love you!
- I love you too!

08:38.076 --> 08:39.576
Okay, come on, honey,
you're gonna miss your flight.

08:39.610 --> 08:41.910
Okay. All right, be
a good girl for daddy,

08:41.945 --> 08:43.011
and you have so much fun
while mommy's gone, okay?

08:44.415 --> 08:46.183
Here you go.

08:46.217 --> 08:47.250
Okay.

08:50.754 --> 08:53.022
Georgie, come here.

08:53.057 --> 08:56.458
I want you to hang on
to this for me, 'kay?

08:56.526 --> 08:57.459
There you go.

08:57.527 --> 08:59.395
Your bracelet...

08:59.462 --> 09:01.230
You're giving me
your bracelet?!

09:01.264 --> 09:03.566
Keep it for me
till I get back, okay?

09:03.600 --> 09:05.201
Which could be sooner
rather than later

09:05.235 --> 09:06.635
if you don't take good care
of my sister.

09:06.670 --> 09:08.504
Don't worry, I'm all over it.

09:08.538 --> 09:10.707
Okay.
Let's do this.

09:10.741 --> 09:11.740
Okay, honey.

09:11.808 --> 09:13.409
Oh, I love you.

09:13.443 --> 09:15.744
Love you too.

09:31.027 --> 09:33.895
<i>Wow, Lou wasn't kidding
when she said she had a to-do list.</i>

09:33.963 --> 09:35.963
Yeah, I know, more
like a spreadsheet, right?

09:35.965 --> 09:39.234
"Clean dude ranch
for weekend check-ins."

09:39.301 --> 09:41.402
Sounds great.

09:41.437 --> 09:42.637
Oh, come on, you kiddin' me?
We'll make it fun.

09:44.040 --> 09:44.972
Ah, it's my boss.

09:46.408 --> 09:47.575
He can wait.

09:47.643 --> 09:48.909
Who cares?

09:51.247 --> 09:53.715
All right, maybe not.
Let me just check.

09:53.749 --> 09:56.117
Oh, yeah, I was afraid of that.

09:56.184 --> 09:57.818
Bad news?

09:57.886 --> 09:59.754
That, uh, pipeline project
I was heading up

09:59.821 --> 10:01.188
<i>just fast-tracked, so...</i>

10:01.256 --> 10:03.257
What does that mean?

10:03.291 --> 10:05.960
<i>Uh, it means a big
report with a big deadline.</i>

10:05.994 --> 10:07.694
So much for fun.

10:07.729 --> 10:09.063
No, now, not necessarily.

10:09.131 --> 10:10.697
I can work on the report
at night

10:10.766 --> 10:11.999
and, uh, we'll still have
lots of time to do stuff.

10:12.067 --> 10:13.533
You'll see.

10:13.601 --> 10:16.403
Starting with cleaning
the dude ranch.

10:16.471 --> 10:18.772
Why don't you and I saddle up a
couple of horses and we'll ride over?

10:18.806 --> 10:20.840
If you pack a lunch, you can
have a picnic down on the dock.

10:20.908 --> 10:23.042
I'll look after Katie.

10:23.110 --> 10:25.178
<i>See?</i>

10:25.212 --> 10:26.613
<i>And maybe you'd
have a lot more fun</i>

10:26.648 --> 10:28.548
if you left your phone at home.

10:30.084 --> 10:31.117
Ah...

10:34.054 --> 10:36.589
If I don't go back to school
soon, I'm gonna blow the term.

10:36.657 --> 10:38.191
I just can't pretend
everything's all right.

10:38.225 --> 10:40.126
That's exactly
what you should do.

10:40.161 --> 10:43.229
Flunkin' out's
not gonna do anybody any good.

10:43.297 --> 10:45.899
Well, I guess if I left now, I might
be able to make my surgery lab.

10:45.966 --> 10:48.134
Go. I'll keep doing this.

10:48.202 --> 10:49.135
<i>I don't mind pickin' up</i>
<i>the slack</i>

10:49.203 --> 10:51.136
for the next little while.

10:51.204 --> 10:53.372
All right, but just until
Amy feels better.

10:53.407 --> 10:55.675
You know,
I bet she misses this guy.

10:55.709 --> 10:57.142
She might be able
to ride him yet,

10:57.177 --> 10:59.244
but, I mean, she can come by
and brush him or somethin'.

10:59.313 --> 11:00.979
Yeah, maybe later.

11:01.014 --> 11:02.981
She's just, uh,
sleeping right now.

11:03.016 --> 11:06.218
Yeah,
maybe that's a good thing.

11:06.252 --> 11:08.987
Come and see this.
Amy's not gonna like it.

11:12.491 --> 11:13.892
<i>I better get that off him
before he hurts himself.</i>

11:13.960 --> 11:15.961
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

11:15.995 --> 11:17.529
You don't have to be
a vet student to pull a shoe.

11:17.563 --> 11:19.064
Go.

11:19.098 --> 11:21.466
Are you sure? Yeah.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.635
Thanks.

11:23.669 --> 11:25.870
Workin' kind of takes my
mind off the whole Ashley thing.

11:25.904 --> 11:27.972
Well, women in general,
actually.

11:28.006 --> 11:29.774
You mean Nicole?

11:29.809 --> 11:31.370
The old Caleb woulda been
all over that.

11:31.377 --> 11:32.978
The new Caleb,
he's keeping his distance.

11:38.384 --> 11:39.617
Maybe Lou being
gone isn't so bad

11:39.652 --> 11:41.685
if I get to hang out with you.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.620
Well, I like
hanging out with you too.

11:46.258 --> 11:48.692
You've gotta be kidding me!

11:48.727 --> 11:50.594
<i>Whoa.</i>

11:50.628 --> 11:54.431
Someone did a number
on this place.

11:54.466 --> 11:55.466
Whoa! Whoa!

11:55.500 --> 11:56.967
Whoa! Hold on, Georgie!

11:57.001 --> 11:58.402
Whoa!

11:59.971 --> 12:02.439
Easy. Whoa, whoa!

12:02.507 --> 12:03.707
Whoa! What are they?!

12:06.177 --> 12:07.478
<i>Okay, we better get outta here!</i>

12:09.748 --> 12:11.081
Let's go.

12:16.420 --> 12:17.620
Good boy.
I'm almost done.

12:18.990 --> 12:20.590
There you go, buddy. Hey?

12:22.593 --> 12:24.527
Hey, Amy. Hey.

12:24.595 --> 12:26.296
I thought you were down
for the count.

12:26.364 --> 12:28.932
It turns out I'm not very good
at doing nothing.

12:28.966 --> 12:31.934
Well, if you're lookin'
for something...

12:32.002 --> 12:34.036
A nail went in kinda deep

12:34.070 --> 12:35.337
and I think there might be
something cookin' in there.

12:35.372 --> 12:37.740
Do you wanna have a look?

12:39.342 --> 12:40.610
Yeah, sure.

12:49.085 --> 12:50.285
Amy, are you all right?!

12:51.487 --> 12:53.488
Hey, what just happened?

12:53.556 --> 12:55.424
Nothing, nothing. I'm fine.

12:55.491 --> 12:58.027
Come on, that didn't look
like nothin', Amy.

12:58.094 --> 12:59.361
Caleb, I can't.

13:10.072 --> 13:11.640
You better have
another one of those.

13:11.707 --> 13:15.043
First day back at class
was brutal.

13:15.110 --> 13:17.646
Now that I'm living here,
the fridge'll be fully stocked.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.113
Well,
don't get used to it.

13:19.182 --> 13:20.982
I'm not gonna be
at heartland forever.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.518
Just until Amy feels better.

13:23.586 --> 13:27.421
Yeah, speakin' of Amy, uh,
something kinda strange happened.

13:29.558 --> 13:33.695
I think she might be
seeing things that aren't there.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.564
Yeah, she is.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.299
So you know what
I'm talking about then?

13:38.333 --> 13:41.602
I think I got
a pretty good idea.

13:41.636 --> 13:43.504
It could be the pain medication
that she's on.

13:43.538 --> 13:46.340
You know as well as anyone that stuff
can mess with your head, right?

13:46.408 --> 13:47.808
Yes, I do, but, uh...

13:50.378 --> 13:53.714
I know about something else.

13:53.781 --> 13:56.149
They call it "the dread."

13:57.619 --> 14:00.020
What's that?

14:00.054 --> 14:01.054
Remember my wreck in Montana?

14:01.089 --> 14:02.555
Yeah.

14:02.623 --> 14:06.727
After that, I couldn't even look
at a horse without feeling it.

14:06.761 --> 14:08.195
My heart would beat so hard
inside my chest

14:08.229 --> 14:09.662
I swear it was gonna explode.

14:13.234 --> 14:14.400
You think that's what's
happening with Amy?

14:14.435 --> 14:17.604
Yeah, especially after
what happened.

14:17.638 --> 14:20.540
I mean, maybe it's not exactly
the same, but it's damn close.

14:23.377 --> 14:26.078
It's like you take a regular
pig and you super-size it.

14:26.113 --> 14:27.313
And they are incredibly
nasty looking.

14:27.348 --> 14:29.749
Sounds like wild boar.

14:29.783 --> 14:32.517
From what I hear,
they're overrunning ranch lands

14:32.552 --> 14:34.519
and attacking livestock...

14:34.554 --> 14:35.621
And spooking horses.

14:35.655 --> 14:37.389
I could barely stay on.

14:37.423 --> 14:41.727
Wild boars and horses,
never a good mix.

14:41.762 --> 14:44.463
Seriously, it was like
the attack of the zombie pigs.

14:44.497 --> 14:46.665
Well, all I know is
they are miserable critters

14:46.699 --> 14:48.767
you do not want to engage.

14:48.801 --> 14:51.703
They get on your tail, they'll
give you a run for your money.

14:51.738 --> 14:52.771
That's perfect.

14:52.805 --> 14:55.407
So I get to add wild boar
invasion to my to-do list now.

14:55.441 --> 14:56.642
I know the timing
might not be great for you,

14:56.676 --> 14:58.343
but you can't ignore it.

14:58.378 --> 15:00.379
We gotta get on this
first thing in the morning.

15:00.446 --> 15:02.447
Okay.

15:02.482 --> 15:03.649
Hey, Lou! How's Toronto?

15:05.251 --> 15:06.251
Yeah? Nice hotel?

15:08.187 --> 15:09.954
Oh, is that first thing
in the morning?

15:10.022 --> 15:12.356
Don't be nervous, honey.
You're gonna be great, yeah.

15:12.391 --> 15:14.092
Here? Good. We're all good.

15:14.126 --> 15:17.095
Tell her about the wild boars!

15:17.163 --> 15:18.596
What's that?

15:18.664 --> 15:21.166
Oh no, it's nothing.
It was nothing.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.232
Don't worry about a thing, Lou.

15:22.267 --> 15:23.668
I got the to-do list
under control.

15:23.702 --> 15:25.169
Everything is gonna be
just fine.

15:29.908 --> 15:31.509
<i>I see what you mean.</i>

15:31.543 --> 15:33.143
<i>This place is an unholy mess.</i>

15:35.213 --> 15:37.047
It's even worse
than it was yesterday.

15:39.617 --> 15:41.618
Ah... Lou. Like clockwork.

15:41.652 --> 15:43.020
Better take that.

15:43.087 --> 15:44.454
Yep.

15:44.522 --> 15:45.242
Hey, sweetheart...

15:47.091 --> 15:48.058
Your first radio
talk show interview.

15:48.126 --> 15:50.060
That's amazing.

15:50.128 --> 15:52.129
Yeah, I'm sorry I missed it.

15:52.197 --> 15:53.297
No, I-I can catch it
on the podcast later.

15:53.364 --> 15:54.731
Yeah. For sure.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.534
Katie's toddler yoga?

15:57.601 --> 15:59.502
Yes. Of course.

15:59.570 --> 16:00.537
I'm just getting ready
to go now.

16:02.072 --> 16:03.540
You bet.

16:04.742 --> 16:05.908
What the hell?

16:08.813 --> 16:10.613
Can you? No, no, not you.

16:10.648 --> 16:13.415
Yeah. Everything is good.
I'll talk to you soon, honey.

16:13.483 --> 16:15.351
I'd be careful using that
fancy video phone of yours.

16:15.418 --> 16:17.253
You don't want Lou to see this.

16:17.287 --> 16:18.754
<i>No kidding.</i>

16:21.925 --> 16:24.093
No, whoa! Whoa!

16:24.161 --> 16:25.661
Unless you're packing a rifle
and you plan to use it,

16:25.695 --> 16:26.662
I'd be staying put.

16:28.998 --> 16:31.279
Well, Georgie was right,
attack of the zombie pigs.

16:54.257 --> 16:56.858
I made you some coffee, Ty.

16:56.893 --> 17:00.028
<i>Oh, thank you.
Very kind of you.</i>

17:00.062 --> 17:01.829
Ahmed?
What are you doing here?

17:01.864 --> 17:03.197
Well, I heard the coffee here
was very good,

17:03.231 --> 17:04.499
so I thought I'd drop by.

17:06.402 --> 17:08.935
Any word on Adrian?

17:08.970 --> 17:11.806
Yes. I am relieved to say
that he was arrested at the airport

17:11.839 --> 17:14.008
and charged
with criminal negligence.

17:14.041 --> 17:17.278
Good thing the cops found him
before I did.

17:17.311 --> 17:18.078
Would you like some coffee?

17:18.113 --> 17:18.845
Hmm.

17:21.648 --> 17:24.550
Look at you, up and around.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.053
How have you been feeling?

17:26.087 --> 17:28.989
Pretty good. Better.

17:29.024 --> 17:30.724
Actually I'm glad you're here.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.563
I wanted to give you this -
it's too much money.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.399
<i>I can't take it,</i>
<i>I didn't earn it.</i>

17:39.434 --> 17:43.688
Money can't even begin to
compensate you for what happened.

17:43.704 --> 17:45.171
Please, Ty.

17:45.205 --> 17:47.441
You make sure she cashes
this cheque.

17:47.475 --> 17:52.078
Good luck telling Amy
what to do but I'll try.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.981
I thought you would like to know
that emir is doing well.

17:55.015 --> 17:56.876
The wounds are superficial.
They are healing no problem.

17:56.877 --> 17:58.705
Good. And Zeus?

17:58.785 --> 18:00.686
Yes...

18:00.754 --> 18:03.789
Actually, Zeus is the reason
that I dropped by like this.

18:03.824 --> 18:06.525
<i>I've reached a decision</i>
<i>and it wasn't easy.</i>

18:06.560 --> 18:08.327
Even though the stallion
is from top bloodlines

18:08.394 --> 18:11.897
and has great promise, I
believe he's unmanageable.

18:11.932 --> 18:13.966
That sounds a bit harsh.

18:14.033 --> 18:15.935
In my opinion,
the horse cannot be redeemed.

18:16.002 --> 18:17.903
So what are you gonna do?

18:17.938 --> 18:21.239
My vet will deal
with the problem.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.908
You mean, put down
a perfectly healthy horse?

18:23.943 --> 18:25.944
Under the circumstances, yes.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.980
I don't agree with that.

18:28.047 --> 18:30.882
Well, I didn't think you would,
but I have made up my mind.

18:30.916 --> 18:32.217
I will never be able
to look at the horse again

18:32.285 --> 18:33.918
without thinking
of what he did to you.

18:33.987 --> 18:34.886
He's cursed.

18:41.894 --> 18:43.728
It's pretty messed up
what Ahmed plans to do.

18:45.631 --> 18:47.899
You know, with Zeus.

18:47.933 --> 18:50.368
Yeah, I know what you mean.

18:50.435 --> 18:52.670
Really?

18:52.738 --> 18:55.239
Because this type of thing
usually makes you crazy.

18:55.273 --> 18:56.740
I mean the horse is cursed?

18:56.808 --> 18:58.442
Come on.

18:58.510 --> 19:00.978
Obviously, I don't agree
with him,

19:01.013 --> 19:02.679
but there's nothing
I can do about it.

19:02.747 --> 19:05.182
It's his horse.

19:11.189 --> 19:13.156
I'm worried, Jack.

19:13.190 --> 19:14.625
I've tried to talk to her,

19:14.659 --> 19:16.539
but every time I do,
she says everything's fine.

19:16.561 --> 19:19.429
And you don't think it is?

19:19.497 --> 19:21.632
Something's going on.

19:21.699 --> 19:23.767
She's seeing things
that aren't there.

19:23.801 --> 19:25.335
What kind of things?

19:25.403 --> 19:27.638
I don't know.

19:27.672 --> 19:30.606
But whatever it is
she thinks they're real.

19:30.641 --> 19:32.175
Well, she took a pretty good
knock on the head.

19:32.243 --> 19:33.910
It's understandable, isn't it?

19:33.977 --> 19:34.977
Maybe.

19:37.714 --> 19:40.150
But if I didn't know her so well,
I'd think she's afraid of horses.

19:40.217 --> 19:41.151
Oh.

19:44.588 --> 19:46.455
Remember after
your motorcycle wreck,

19:46.523 --> 19:47.890
I brought your bike
back to the ranch?

19:47.925 --> 19:49.859
Yeah.

19:49.893 --> 19:51.360
And you made me fix it.

19:51.428 --> 19:55.031
Yeah, and as I recall, you
weren't too happy about that.

19:55.065 --> 19:55.998
I know.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.769
Looking back on it,

19:59.836 --> 20:02.071
I'd say that worked out
pretty good, wouldn't you?

20:02.105 --> 20:03.172
Huh...

20:05.741 --> 20:09.144
I have to do the same thing
for Amy.

20:09.212 --> 20:12.013
All right. Thanks.

20:20.289 --> 20:23.191
Hey, Caleb.
Got a minute?

20:23.225 --> 20:25.126
Actually, I'm just
on my way to work.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.161
So what is it that
you've got going on now?

20:27.196 --> 20:30.431
Bucking broncos
or whatever it is that you do?

20:30.466 --> 20:32.601
I'm helping Amy out
until she's back on her feet.

20:32.635 --> 20:34.903
Hey, you remember what you were
saying about relationships?

20:34.937 --> 20:39.107
You know what?
This maybe isn't the right time.

20:39.141 --> 20:40.274
Like I said,
I've gotta go to work.

20:40.309 --> 20:43.511
And when I'm at work, I pretty
much only think of work,

20:43.545 --> 20:45.746
and right now I'm buried
up to my neck in work.

20:45.780 --> 20:51.352
Okay, ah... Well, if you ever get a
break, from, you know, your work,

20:51.386 --> 20:55.856
I have a really great bottle of
Pinot noir I've been saving up.

20:55.924 --> 20:56.790
That's red wine.

20:58.459 --> 21:00.227
I'm more of a beer drinker.

21:00.261 --> 21:02.096
Really?
A cowboy who drinks beer?

21:04.833 --> 21:06.667
You're just full of surprises.

21:16.944 --> 21:20.547
Hey, Ahmed. Thanks for this.

21:20.581 --> 21:21.248
It's great that you're giving
the horse another shot.

21:21.282 --> 21:23.016
Is it?

21:23.050 --> 21:24.518
You see, after I agreed
to your request,

21:24.552 --> 21:26.485
I began to have
second thoughts.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.787
What if by bringing
this horse here,

21:27.821 --> 21:30.023
I am putting Amy
in harm's way once more?

21:30.090 --> 21:31.223
Well, I understand
what you're saying,

21:31.291 --> 21:32.358
but I can assure you
that's not gonna happen.

21:32.392 --> 21:35.561
But if it did because I let
you talk me into this,

21:35.595 --> 21:37.329
I would not be able
to live with myself.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.832
And that is why I am giving
you one week and no more.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.272
So I made a few calls

21:46.306 --> 21:49.175
and it turns out wild boars
are classified as pests

21:49.209 --> 21:51.009
by fish and wildlife.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.111
See, that's why most folks
would just as soon shoot them

21:53.146 --> 21:54.513
and have a big old barbecue.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.815
Seriously?

21:56.849 --> 21:59.450
Way to turn me
into a hardcore vegan.

21:59.518 --> 22:00.786
Well, that's why
I'm gonna trap them instead.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.954
I don't know.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.190
Wild boars can spot
a baited trap a mile away.

22:05.257 --> 22:08.026
Might be best if you let me
take care of 'em.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.861
No. No, you know what?
I appreciate the offer.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.363
<i>But it's my problem,</i>
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

22:12.431 --> 22:14.732
<i>You wanna learn the
hard way, suit yourself.</i>

22:16.468 --> 22:17.635
Oh my God. Get back!

22:22.541 --> 22:23.974
<i>Easy, Zeus!</i>

22:26.745 --> 22:28.779
<i>Easy, easy.</i>

22:31.750 --> 22:33.784
Why is he doing this, grandpa?

22:33.852 --> 22:35.953
He just wants to help you.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.487
This isn't the way.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.950
Ty, you know I don't wanna
see that horse.

22:57.984 --> 23:00.519
Come on,
it's just a horse, Amy.

23:00.554 --> 23:02.388
<i>It's not that simple, okay?</i>

23:02.422 --> 23:04.557
Why did you bring him here?

23:04.591 --> 23:05.824
<i>You heard what Ahmed said.</i>

23:05.859 --> 23:07.860
What choice did I have?

23:07.894 --> 23:10.282
Come on, look at the guy.
He's just scared, Amy.

23:17.003 --> 23:18.436
I thought you said
you didn't blame him.

23:18.471 --> 23:19.471
I don't.

23:21.307 --> 23:22.274
But it's too soon,
I'm not ready.

23:22.308 --> 23:25.477
Hold up. Hey...

23:25.511 --> 23:27.646
You said it yourself,
you need to get back to work.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.581
You got a week.

23:29.615 --> 23:32.116
A week? What am I supposed
to do with him in a week?

23:32.151 --> 23:35.153
Amy, it's his last chance.

23:35.187 --> 23:37.555
If you wait too long, you might
never get over your fear...

23:37.590 --> 23:39.390
And Zeus will be dead.

23:44.629 --> 23:46.864
Okay, I'll try.

23:54.039 --> 23:55.406
You know, experts
estimate that there are over

23:55.440 --> 23:57.941
a thousand feral pigs
right here in alberta.

23:57.975 --> 24:00.644
Whoa! We're gonna
need a bigger trap!

24:00.679 --> 24:02.746
<i>Peter! Peter...</i>

24:02.781 --> 24:04.247
Oh my God,
I was just about to call you!

24:04.282 --> 24:06.317
What is going on here?
What happened?!

24:06.351 --> 24:07.851
Yeah, I know,
there is a bit of a situation,

24:07.885 --> 24:08.719
but I don't want you
to worry about it, okay?

24:08.787 --> 24:09.747
'Cause I'm on top of it.

24:09.754 --> 24:11.388
I have check-ins this weekend!

24:11.456 --> 24:12.355
I mean, you are aware of that?

24:12.389 --> 24:13.269
Yeah, yeah, no worries.

24:13.291 --> 24:15.091
Seriously?

24:15.159 --> 24:16.259
I mean, you think
we're gonna be ready?

24:16.294 --> 24:18.061
Well, that depends.

24:18.129 --> 24:20.130
Do the dudes like wild boars?

24:20.164 --> 24:21.198
Wild boars?

24:23.201 --> 24:27.037
Okay, I'm gonna assume that we're
not talking about bacon or pate?

24:27.071 --> 24:27.938
<i>No, you're right, we
are talking about wild boar</i>

24:27.972 --> 24:29.305
and there are, at least,

24:29.373 --> 24:31.574
a couple running loose
around here right now.

24:31.642 --> 24:34.243
But we're completely
booked this weekend!

24:34.311 --> 24:36.212
I mean,
I have a family reunion.

24:36.246 --> 24:38.366
I've got guests coming in
from all over north America!

24:38.382 --> 24:40.182
What am I supposed to do?

24:40.250 --> 24:41.484
You should leave, now.

24:43.620 --> 24:44.954
You know what? You
actually should leave

24:45.021 --> 24:47.522
and don't come back
until I give you the okay.

24:47.557 --> 24:49.191
Really? Yeah.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.895
Okay... oh, hey!

24:52.929 --> 24:55.998
Do you think this is something that
maybe Lou needs to know about?

24:56.066 --> 24:57.699
No! No, no, no, no, no.

24:57.767 --> 24:59.668
No, honestly, it's no big deal.
I got it.

24:59.736 --> 25:01.837
Really? Yeah.

25:01.904 --> 25:03.505
Okay. Okay.

25:06.843 --> 25:08.009
All right, you want to
give me a hand with that one?

25:08.077 --> 25:08.844
Yeah.

25:38.072 --> 25:39.006
Hey, boy.

25:45.547 --> 25:47.848
You okay?!

25:47.916 --> 25:49.483
You all right?

25:51.585 --> 25:52.286
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:52.353 --> 25:54.487
<i>I'm fine.</i>

25:54.555 --> 25:56.656
Don't you have to get to class
or something?

25:56.724 --> 25:58.125
I can watch the lectures
online.

25:58.159 --> 25:59.826
No, Ty, go, it's okay.

26:02.096 --> 26:04.464
I'd rather have some alone time
to figure this guy out.

26:04.498 --> 26:05.799
No, it doesn't feel right.

26:05.866 --> 26:06.733
I don't want to leave
you alone here.

26:06.767 --> 26:08.601
She won't be alone.

26:08.636 --> 26:10.169
I'll be here
until you get back.

26:15.342 --> 26:16.976
What's that for?

26:17.010 --> 26:18.845
This is a tripwire.

26:20.815 --> 26:23.082
So the wild boar eats his way
into the trap,

26:23.116 --> 26:24.951
stumbles over
the tripwire and...

26:26.019 --> 26:27.853
Bingo!

26:27.887 --> 26:29.288
Well, is it gonna work?

26:29.323 --> 26:30.923
What do mean
"is it gonna work"?

26:30.958 --> 26:33.359
When did you become
such a skeptic?

26:33.393 --> 26:36.395
Here, you read this,
tell me what it says.

26:36.430 --> 26:38.030
"Tuskers check list?"

26:38.065 --> 26:39.932
Yeah, "trapping for dummies."

26:39.967 --> 26:42.400
Okay...

26:42.435 --> 26:44.596
"Install the trap in an area
frequented by wild boars."

26:44.604 --> 26:46.738
Check.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.640
<i>Bait the trap with
yellow corn inside and outside.</i>

26:48.675 --> 26:50.909
Done.

26:50.944 --> 26:53.244
Okay, set the trip line
so a wild boar in the trap

26:53.279 --> 26:54.813
will trigger the gate.

26:54.848 --> 26:57.482
I'm workin' on it right now.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.652
Well, you better work faster,
'cause here they come!

27:02.754 --> 27:04.589
<i>What do we do?!</i>

27:04.623 --> 27:05.756
<i>Um...</i>

27:05.791 --> 27:07.625
Run! Just run!

27:20.005 --> 27:22.039
Woo!

27:23.909 --> 27:25.275
<i>That was close.</i>

27:25.343 --> 27:27.845
Now what?

27:27.913 --> 27:29.947
Okay, the way I figure it,
we've got two options:

27:30.015 --> 27:33.317
One, we wait it out.

27:33.351 --> 27:35.319
Two, we make a run for it.

27:35.387 --> 27:38.222
Call Jack.

27:38.256 --> 27:40.190
Oh God, and listen to him say,
"I told you so?"

27:40.225 --> 27:41.892
You know what? Personally,
I'd rather just wait it out.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.896
Oh, great, it's Lou.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.564
Talk about perfect timing,
again.

27:47.598 --> 27:49.432
Well, you don't have
to answer it.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.836
Why don't you just...
Pretend you're busy.

27:52.904 --> 27:55.772
No, honey, grownups only do that
when they've got something to hide.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.240
Hey, Lou!

27:58.843 --> 28:00.777
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

28:00.845 --> 28:03.146
Oh, Katie's yoga
was-was fantastic!

28:03.213 --> 28:04.813
I know.

28:04.881 --> 28:06.282
Who knew that little kid
was so flexible?

28:06.316 --> 28:07.550
Mm-hmm.

28:07.617 --> 28:10.353
Yes, Georgie is...

28:10.421 --> 28:12.088
<i>Standing right beside me</i>

28:12.156 --> 28:14.957
and we're just grabbing a snack
<i>before we go to ballet.</i>

28:15.025 --> 28:18.194
Yeah, for sure, hon.
Okay, I should go.

28:18.262 --> 28:19.762
Okay, I love you too. Bye.

28:19.796 --> 28:22.297
For a grownup, you're
pretty good at pretending.

28:22.365 --> 28:24.399
Thank you.

28:24.467 --> 28:26.769
Here's the thing...

28:26.836 --> 28:28.170
These pigs aren't going
anywhere very soon,

28:28.237 --> 28:29.471
and you actually
really should be at ballet.

28:29.539 --> 28:31.273
Are you kidding me?!

28:31.340 --> 28:33.642
Even being stuck in here
is way better than ballet!

28:33.710 --> 28:35.430
Okay, but I've reassessed
the situation here

28:35.478 --> 28:37.279
and you're probably right.

28:37.346 --> 28:38.880
I think the responsible thing
to do is to call Jack, okay?

28:38.948 --> 28:41.316
No way! And just give up?!

28:41.384 --> 28:44.419
No, not an option!
We can just wait it out.

28:58.667 --> 29:00.835
<i>Whoa, whoa.</i>

29:00.869 --> 29:02.303
Come on, come on! Mmm-hmm.

29:05.540 --> 29:08.242
Hey, Caleb, thanks for
bringing him in for me.

29:08.276 --> 29:09.543
I really appreciate it.

29:09.611 --> 29:11.912
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

29:11.946 --> 29:14.915
And this guy - hey, hey, hey! -
Sure could use some manners.

29:14.949 --> 29:16.584
And I guess I'm not the one
who's gonna teach him, am I?

29:16.618 --> 29:18.519
I can't even get close to him.

29:18.553 --> 29:20.354
Cut yourself some slack.
He just got here.

29:23.992 --> 29:27.160
Come on, Amy, it's only natural
you'd be afraid of this horse.

29:27.194 --> 29:29.329
I'm not just afraid of him,
Caleb.

29:29.363 --> 29:30.203
It's worse than that.

29:31.933 --> 29:34.267
I get it.
Zeus almost killed you.

29:34.301 --> 29:37.871
<i>It wasn't his fault!
He didn't mean to hurt me.</i>

29:37.905 --> 29:42.075
It's just every time I look at him I...
can't even breathe.

29:42.110 --> 29:44.244
I know. Believe me, I do.

29:44.278 --> 29:45.878
You do?

29:45.912 --> 29:48.615
Mmm-hmm.

29:48.649 --> 29:50.517
Remember my wreck
at great falls rodeo?

29:50.551 --> 29:52.752
Yeah.

29:52.786 --> 29:54.220
Well, your old man gave me
a piece of advice

29:54.255 --> 29:57.157
that applies pretty well
to this situation.

29:57.191 --> 29:59.692
Basically, it's cowboy up
or go sit in the truck.

30:01.561 --> 30:03.863
How am I gonna trust him again,
Caleb?

30:03.897 --> 30:08.200
Well, for starters, you
gotta stop over-thinkin' things.

30:08.234 --> 30:10.903
I mean, you've had way worse
horses come through here.

30:11.838 --> 30:13.773
Caleb.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.240
Caleb, he's watching me.

30:17.910 --> 30:19.578
<i>He's staring right at me.</i>

30:24.450 --> 30:26.051
Why don't you brush him,

30:26.118 --> 30:28.720
or, actually,
why don't you give him a treat?

30:28.754 --> 30:30.955
Nothing major,
just regular old horse stuff.

30:32.958 --> 30:33.892
Okay.

30:36.195 --> 30:38.329
Hey, here you go.

30:41.133 --> 30:42.033
You want this?

30:44.136 --> 30:45.070
Here, boy.

30:49.641 --> 30:52.243
Whoa! Whoa!

30:52.311 --> 30:54.378
Amy, you all right? Hey? Yeah?

30:54.446 --> 30:56.046
Yeah. Yeah?

30:56.114 --> 30:57.181
I'm fine, Caleb. I'm fine.

30:57.249 --> 30:58.734
Okay.

31:02.998 --> 31:04.866
<i>Sleep tight, sweetheart.</i>

31:11.773 --> 31:13.707
Hello?

31:13.775 --> 31:15.976
Lou, I just put your daughter
down for a nap.

31:16.044 --> 31:17.611
How's the road
to fame and fortune?

31:19.514 --> 31:22.383
Great, that's great!
So what city-

31:22.450 --> 31:24.685
uh, Georgie?
Uh, she's out with Peter.

31:26.754 --> 31:30.724
Yeah, I guess they could
still be at ballet.

31:30.758 --> 31:34.027
That I don't know.
Somethin' probably came up.

31:34.095 --> 31:37.698
It's... uh, Amy?

31:37.765 --> 31:38.865
Oh, Amy's fine, Lou.

31:41.168 --> 31:44.103
<i>Lou, she's just fine. Fine.</i>

31:46.473 --> 31:50.810
<i>Lou, listen to me,</i>
<i>you're worryin' for nothin'.</i>

31:50.844 --> 31:52.679
Okay, then, you run.
Thanks for the-

31:54.381 --> 31:55.582
Call.

31:55.616 --> 31:58.117
Uh, that was Lou.

31:58.185 --> 32:01.987
Apparently the book tour's
goin' real good.

32:02.022 --> 32:03.789
You okay?

32:03.857 --> 32:05.958
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:06.026 --> 32:07.392
You sure?

32:07.427 --> 32:09.695
Yeah.

32:09.763 --> 32:12.364
<i>Well, do me a favour?</i>

32:12.432 --> 32:14.733
Sit with Katie for a while?

32:28.013 --> 32:29.114
I can't,
I can't take in anymore.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.049
You have to stop.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.450
No, I'm almost done this level!

32:32.484 --> 32:34.485
No, forget it!
It's my phone! Here!

32:35.320 --> 32:36.554
Says the grownup.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.460
<i>I can't believe it.</i>
<i>Those pigs are still out there.</i>

32:47.999 --> 32:52.002
Oh no! Jack's here!

32:52.036 --> 32:54.572
So much for waiting it out.

33:25.202 --> 33:27.604
What's he doing?

33:38.515 --> 33:40.183
Oh no!
He's going to shoot them!

33:42.385 --> 33:44.586
- Jack, don't shoot!
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

33:50.727 --> 33:52.428
Not bad.

33:57.701 --> 33:59.100
What happened?

33:59.168 --> 34:00.569
<i>Jack just shot the tripwire.</i>

34:00.637 --> 34:02.771
On the first try -
not too shabby.

34:05.274 --> 34:06.041
Jack!

34:10.713 --> 34:13.148
<i>Hey, thanks for
bailing us out there, I...</i>

34:13.216 --> 34:14.716
Well, I expected
you home hours ago.

34:14.783 --> 34:16.918
I figured you were in trouble.

34:16.985 --> 34:19.721
Well, Peter expected you to say,
"I told you so."

34:19.788 --> 34:21.789
<i>Now why would I say that?</i>

34:21.858 --> 34:23.491
<i>He did a fine job here.</i>

34:23.559 --> 34:26.527
It's not easy trappin'
wild boar.

34:26.594 --> 34:28.696
Yeah, if I just had a little more
time with that tripwire. I just-

34:28.764 --> 34:30.831
Details.

34:30.899 --> 34:33.167
So, what are we gonna
do with them now?

34:33.235 --> 34:35.002
Well, that's up to
fish and wildlife to decide.

34:35.070 --> 34:37.137
Talk about a waste
of a good barbecue.

35:17.211 --> 35:19.445
<i>Amy.</i>

35:19.479 --> 35:21.047
Amy.

35:23.517 --> 35:25.251
Hey.

35:27.288 --> 35:28.487
Good morning.

35:28.522 --> 35:29.889
Good morning.

35:29.924 --> 35:31.957
How'd you sleep?

35:31.991 --> 35:33.492
Really well.

35:33.527 --> 35:34.460
Yeah? Yeah.

35:41.568 --> 35:43.436
I think today's the day.

35:45.305 --> 35:46.038
Okay.

35:52.111 --> 35:54.212
<i>Look at him.</i>

35:54.247 --> 35:58.917
It's like you said,
he's just a horse.

35:58.952 --> 36:00.793
He's not mean, he's not bad,
he's just a horse.

36:04.323 --> 36:06.458
Are you sure you're ready
to do this?

36:09.595 --> 36:10.962
I think so.

36:12.865 --> 36:14.198
I'm gonna need your help.

36:14.266 --> 36:16.033
I'll be right here.

36:23.875 --> 36:24.942
Let me get the gate for you.

36:24.977 --> 36:26.043
Thanks.

36:32.584 --> 36:34.751
<i>Hey, boy.</i>

36:34.786 --> 36:36.620
It's okay.

36:45.196 --> 36:46.463
<i>Whoa!</i>

36:46.531 --> 36:47.430
<i>Whoa, boy!</i>

37:11.955 --> 37:12.922
That's a good boy.

37:32.835 --> 37:34.570
Mornin', Nicole.

37:34.638 --> 37:35.704
<i>- Morning.</i>
<i>- How you doin'?</i>

37:35.772 --> 37:37.306
Just fine, Jack.

37:37.340 --> 37:40.376
Ah, I was on my way to the dude ranch
to do some emergency gardening

37:40.443 --> 37:44.680
and hopefully check-in some guests,
that is if the coast is clear.

37:44.714 --> 37:47.916
So far, so good. Gotta say,

37:47.950 --> 37:50.085
it was quite a deal
gettin' rid of those tuskers.

37:50.119 --> 37:51.352
They're stupid and stubborn.

37:53.355 --> 37:56.758
Speaking of pig-headed...
Is Caleb here?

37:56.793 --> 37:58.727
That's good.

37:58.761 --> 38:00.428
He's in the barn. I'll get him.

38:00.462 --> 38:03.398
No, no, it's, uh,
it's not necessary

38:03.432 --> 38:05.132
would you mind giving him this,
though?

38:05.167 --> 38:07.302
Yeah, sure,
I'll see that he gets it.

38:07.336 --> 38:09.937
Thank you.

38:10.005 --> 38:11.072
You give me a call
if there's a problem over there.

38:11.106 --> 38:11.806
I will.

38:21.083 --> 38:22.616
What did she want?

38:26.855 --> 38:28.022
What's this?

38:29.457 --> 38:31.025
Pinot noir. Ah.

38:32.961 --> 38:36.896
I would have taken you more for
a beer drinkin' man, myself.

38:36.931 --> 38:39.700
Well, to tell you the truth,
Jack, you're right.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.015
Figure you could probably make
better use of that than me.

38:43.338 --> 38:45.272
You know, I don't know
what's going on

38:45.306 --> 38:47.241
between you and Nicole,
it's none of my business,

38:47.275 --> 38:51.277
but I sure was sorry to hear
about what happened with Ashley.

38:53.814 --> 38:55.882
Yeah, yeah,
I was real sorry too.

39:01.655 --> 39:05.391
Georgie, can you do me a
favour and keep an eye on Katie

39:05.425 --> 39:08.694
while I talk to my boss
about that report?

39:08.729 --> 39:11.230
Well, is it finished yet?

39:11.265 --> 39:14.600
No, that's why I gotta go ask
for an extension.

39:14.635 --> 39:16.802
What if he doesn't
give it to you?

39:16.870 --> 39:18.404
What if he fires you instead?

39:21.141 --> 39:22.808
Uh, well, if that happens
then we better hope

39:22.842 --> 39:24.362
that Lou's book
sells a million copies.

39:26.913 --> 39:30.315
You know,
the next time Lou calls,

39:30.383 --> 39:34.052
you don't have to pretend.
You should just tell the truth.

39:34.120 --> 39:36.588
Right.

39:36.622 --> 39:38.824
So I should tell her that
I threw away her to-do list

39:38.858 --> 39:41.626
because I couldn't possibly do
everything that she does?

39:41.694 --> 39:44.629
Lou never could have fought off
an invasion of wild boars,

39:44.697 --> 39:47.632
<i>not like you and me.</i>

39:47.700 --> 39:50.769
So what you're saying is,
if she calls back,

39:50.836 --> 39:53.938
that I should just keep telling
her what I've been telling her?

39:53.972 --> 39:56.374
Yeah, because everything
really is fine.

39:58.376 --> 39:59.076
Good.

40:25.603 --> 40:26.937
Hey, boy.

40:28.807 --> 40:30.073
<i>Come here!</i>

40:32.276 --> 40:34.744
Whoa. Settle, Zeus.
Hang on, hang on.

40:39.116 --> 40:41.218
I cannot believe
what I'm seeing.

40:41.285 --> 40:42.418
I know what you mean.

40:44.488 --> 40:46.089
Good boy.

40:53.964 --> 40:56.131
Ahmed, say hello to your horse.

41:00.003 --> 41:01.537
Hello, my friend.

41:03.874 --> 41:07.034
I'm impressed,
but not surprised.

41:07.143 --> 41:09.644
You really can work miracles.

41:09.679 --> 41:12.948
No, there was never
anything wrong with him.

41:13.016 --> 41:17.819
He wasn't cursed. He's just a
stallion, and that night in the barn,

41:17.854 --> 41:20.822
he had no choice
but to fight for his life.

41:20.890 --> 41:23.525
There's no way he should have
to die because of that.

41:23.593 --> 41:25.527
It was just an accident.

41:25.561 --> 41:28.430
He didn't mean to hurt me.

41:28.498 --> 41:31.199
After all you've been through
and you don't blame the horse?

41:31.233 --> 41:32.901
I don't know what to say.

41:35.104 --> 41:38.672
Do I have your permission
to give your girlfriend a hug?

41:38.707 --> 41:41.042
Permission?
I think that'd be all right.

41:47.917 --> 41:51.085
Thank you, Amy.
Thank you for this.

41:51.120 --> 41:56.223
And thank you for giving both
Zeus and I another chance.

41:56.257 --> 41:57.658
You know that
when you're ready,

41:57.692 --> 42:00.928
you can always come back
and work for me.

42:00.962 --> 42:03.263
When I'm ready,
I'll definitely think about it.

42:03.298 --> 42:04.765
I would be honoured.

42:16.244 --> 42:19.179
You know, I think Ahmed
really cares about you.

42:19.213 --> 42:21.781
It's weird.

42:21.816 --> 42:22.749
<i>I bet you never thought</i>
<i>I'd end up</i>

42:22.783 --> 42:24.484
<i>being friends with a prince?</i>

42:24.518 --> 42:25.452
<i>You
got that right.</i>

42:27.120 --> 42:30.590
Hey, Ty, thank you.

42:30.624 --> 42:33.526
For being by my side
through all of this.

42:33.561 --> 42:37.597
I'd be with you no matter what,
even if you wanted to quit.

42:37.665 --> 42:40.399
And that's why I love you,
because you wouldn't let me.

42:44.571 --> 42:46.805
Am. Yes?

42:46.840 --> 42:47.806
Do I have permission
to kiss you?

42:49.642 --> 42:51.110
Permission granted.

43:31.640 --> 43:36.640
