00:06.985 --> 00:09.419
Cuba strategy for the Kohl
brothers. Let me hear it.

00:09.454 --> 00:11.221
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:11.256 --> 00:12.589
Communists stole
our birthright.

00:12.624 --> 00:13.790
We're gonna take back
what's ours.

00:13.825 --> 00:15.658
<i>We are orbiting
the fucking payday</i>

00:15.693 --> 00:17.327
to end all
motherfucking paydays.

00:17.362 --> 00:19.896
<i>Assuming your ex-wife
doesn't win the offer first.</i>

00:19.931 --> 00:21.564
Seven times my revenue.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.765
<i>When Skip buys my firm,</i>

00:22.801 --> 00:24.434
that's what he's gonna
put in my pocket.

00:24.469 --> 00:26.069
Maybe we take this
away from Monica.

00:26.104 --> 00:27.437
Well, fuck yeah.

00:27.472 --> 00:29.806
<i>Skip just called,
and the Kohl brothers</i>

00:29.841 --> 00:31.674
- are going with Monica.
- Until they sign

00:31.710 --> 00:33.343
on that dotted line,
we can still win this thing.

00:33.378 --> 00:35.945
Take off the Coke-bottle
glasses. You lost.

00:35.981 --> 00:37.247
Monica hacked into our server.

00:37.282 --> 00:38.948
Something you could
use to your advantage,

00:38.984 --> 00:39.983
<i>since she doesn't know
you know.</i>

00:40.018 --> 00:41.017
Correct.

00:41.052 --> 00:42.118
You want to win
this thing, right?

00:42.153 --> 00:43.453
I don't know.

00:43.488 --> 00:45.455
<i>We're going
55,000 miles an hour</i>

00:45.490 --> 00:47.190
<i>toward Cuba,</i>

00:47.225 --> 00:49.158
and you want
to slow down.

02:10.942 --> 02:12.875
Where's the
goddamn hotel?

02:12.911 --> 02:15.111
How close are we to the office
we're going to later?

02:15.146 --> 02:16.980
Oh, no, we're not going
to an office, Jeannie.

02:17.015 --> 02:18.381
No, the Cubans
like to do business

02:18.416 --> 02:20.283
in cafes and
restaurants. Yeah.

02:20.318 --> 02:22.018
Yeah, they're collegial people,

02:22.053 --> 02:23.920
swashbuckling, just
impossibly romantic.

02:23.955 --> 02:26.089
How do you shut this thing off?
Is it a button inside or...?

02:26.124 --> 02:27.757
You know, as Graham
Greene once said,

02:27.792 --> 02:29.993
"In Havana,
anything is possible."

02:30.028 --> 02:34.364
Did he say it with that stupid
accent, or how did he say it?

02:40.505 --> 02:42.939
Welcome to Cuba.

02:42.974 --> 02:48.044
Oh, the perfect jewel of
newly-budding capitalism.

02:48.079 --> 02:50.847
Like a long-dormant
socialist succulent,

02:50.882 --> 02:54.517
one that somebody forgot
to water for 50 years.

02:54.552 --> 02:58.388
But today, motherfuckers, today
Marty Kaan is up in this joint,

02:58.423 --> 03:01.524
ready to make it rain for my new
best friends, the Kohl brothers,

03:01.559 --> 03:05.428
who are gonna spend so much
of their dirty, sexy money

03:05.463 --> 03:08.231
on buying my company that
I officially do not have to

03:08.266 --> 03:12.235
give a fuck about another thing
for as long as I live.

03:12.270 --> 03:16.539
Oh, yes, we are gonna put a
five-star hotel on every beach,

03:16.574 --> 03:19.876
a world-class golf course
in every farmer's field,

03:19.911 --> 03:21.678
fuck it, a Starbucks
on every corner,

03:21.713 --> 03:26.683
because today, today, we start
making this Marty Kaan's Cuba,

03:26.718 --> 03:28.184
profit-turning Cuba.

03:28.219 --> 03:30.153
You might as well call it
"Cuba the resort,"

03:30.188 --> 03:32.055
because by the time
I'm done with this place,

03:32.090 --> 03:34.991
it is gonna jingle
and shine and spit money

03:35.026 --> 03:36.759
like a five-dollar slot machine.

03:40.198 --> 03:42.498
Ooh, nice.

03:42.534 --> 03:43.966
Hey...

03:44.002 --> 03:45.501
Don't have any bars.

03:47.539 --> 03:48.905
Oh, fuck no.

03:48.940 --> 03:50.740
I know. I haven't seen
a single hybrid.

03:50.775 --> 03:53.042
No, no, look in
fucking front of you.

03:53.078 --> 03:55.211
Oh, great. You know,
my balls literally ascend

03:55.246 --> 03:56.813
into my viscera
when I see her.

03:56.848 --> 03:57.814
Mine, too.

03:57.849 --> 04:00.016
Kaan &amp; Asycophants, huh?

04:00.051 --> 04:01.818
Monica, Monica, Monica.

04:01.853 --> 04:03.820
Oh, you'd be
so much more handsome

04:03.855 --> 04:05.455
without these warts and goiters.

04:05.490 --> 04:07.390
You should really
have them removed.

04:07.425 --> 04:09.025
And let's talk about
how sad it is

04:09.060 --> 04:10.159
that you're here
pursuing business

04:10.195 --> 04:11.494
that you're never gonna get.

04:11.529 --> 04:13.463
Ah, well, you know, we just
wanted to see the place

04:13.498 --> 04:14.530
before you raped
and pillaged it.

04:14.566 --> 04:15.531
Ta-da.

04:15.567 --> 04:16.999
You gonna introduce us
to your friend?

04:17.035 --> 04:18.901
- No.
- No.

04:18.937 --> 04:19.601
No.

04:19.637 --> 04:20.737
- No.
- Really?

04:20.772 --> 04:22.638
You lose,
but you show up anyway.

04:22.674 --> 04:24.373
I don't know,
that seems undignified.

04:24.409 --> 04:26.309
But I guess it's the
right of the vanquished

04:26.344 --> 04:28.344
to sift through the ashes
of their ruined village.

04:29.514 --> 04:30.613
It's good to see
you, too, bud.

04:30.648 --> 04:32.348
Wait a minute,
did we miss a memo?

04:32.383 --> 04:34.884
Because I seem to remember
the Kohl brothers indicating

04:34.919 --> 04:36.753
that this whole thing
was still up for grabs.

04:36.788 --> 04:38.821
- And that you were a pussy.
- They did say that.

04:38.857 --> 04:41.057
Also, Skip,
you look like Ricky Ricardo

04:41.092 --> 04:42.225
fucked Justin Bieber.

04:42.260 --> 04:43.392
- Oh!
- Just all over your shirt.

04:44.429 --> 04:45.661
You look like such a tourist.

04:45.697 --> 04:46.829
All right, all right,
you know what?

04:46.865 --> 04:48.064
Let's just play nice,
everybody, okay?

04:48.099 --> 04:49.432
- It's a bountiful country.
- Sure.

04:49.467 --> 04:50.933
- There's plenty for everyone.
- All right.

04:50.969 --> 04:52.435
Skip, I'm gonna actually,
if you don't mind.

04:52.470 --> 04:54.137
Taxi!

04:55.607 --> 04:57.206
- Wait.
- Oh.

04:57.242 --> 04:59.075
What you got working, Marty?

04:59.110 --> 05:01.210
Now, what makes you think
I got something working, Mo?

05:01.246 --> 05:03.246
Oh, because of
your fucking tell.

05:03.281 --> 05:04.714
You see,
quiet, humble Marty...

05:04.749 --> 05:07.150
that means he's got
a shiv in his palm.

05:07.185 --> 05:09.185
You know what?
Just enjoy Cuba, baby.

05:09.220 --> 05:11.721
And thank you for letting me
know I have a tell.

05:11.756 --> 05:13.022
Yeah, no problem.

05:13.057 --> 05:15.625
There's plenty more
where that one came from.

05:32.143 --> 05:33.943
What? Oh, my God,
what happened?

05:33.978 --> 05:35.211
- What?
- The hell is wrong with you?

05:35.246 --> 05:36.379
- What happened?
- What did you do?

05:36.414 --> 05:37.513
- Don't you dare.
- Did someone hit you

05:37.549 --> 05:38.714
- in the face?
- I know...

05:38.750 --> 05:39.715
- What's wrong?
- That's so dangerous.

05:39.751 --> 05:40.716
You can get an infection
like that.

05:40.752 --> 05:41.784
Okay, I'm sorry.
I didn't know

05:41.820 --> 05:43.186
- you can get an infection.
- Oh, yeah?

05:43.221 --> 05:44.821
- I had no idea. I had no idea.
- You can get an infection.

05:44.856 --> 05:46.255
I've taken two Ambien, okay?

05:46.291 --> 05:48.558
And I really need to catch my
sleep window, so cut it out!

05:48.593 --> 05:49.725
Okay. I'm sorry,
for real.

05:49.761 --> 05:50.827
I apologize.

05:50.862 --> 05:53.062
No, I'm sorry.
Maybe I overreacted, but...

05:53.097 --> 05:55.198
I didn't know it was gonna
wake you up, first of all.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.600
- For real, I'm sorry.
- Well, it did wake me up.

05:57.635 --> 05:58.835
Excuse me.

05:58.870 --> 06:00.469
Sorry.

06:00.505 --> 06:02.371
Ugh. I'm a child.

06:02.407 --> 06:04.273
That's my problem;
I don't fucking grow up.

06:04.309 --> 06:05.308
Got to learn.

06:10.715 --> 06:12.682
- No way. Twice? No.
- I don't believe it.

06:12.717 --> 06:13.850
- You know what?
- What, it happened again?!

06:13.885 --> 06:15.051
I can't be near you.
I can't...

06:15.086 --> 06:16.052
- It wasn't me that time!
- Don't follow me.

06:16.087 --> 06:17.053
For real,
it wasn't me that time.

06:17.088 --> 06:18.054
You are a child.

06:18.089 --> 06:19.922
<i>You're</i> a child.

06:20.925 --> 06:22.859
Oh.

06:22.894 --> 06:24.794
Hello. Pardon me.
Do you mind terribly

06:24.829 --> 06:25.895
if I sit here?

06:25.930 --> 06:27.830
Oh. Well, of course
you can sit here.

06:27.866 --> 06:29.198
Oh, thank you.

06:40.044 --> 06:41.210
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:41.246 --> 06:43.045
Just trying to

06:43.081 --> 06:44.981
focus on this, you know,
make sure we're bulletproof

06:45.016 --> 06:46.215
on all this Cuba stuff.

06:46.251 --> 06:47.950
I think we're in
pretty good shape.

06:47.986 --> 06:49.452
- You do?
- Yeah.

06:49.487 --> 06:51.587
Well, if we can secure
these long-term leases

06:51.623 --> 06:53.589
in our first meeting, and
then, you know, walk that into

06:53.625 --> 06:54.957
our meeting with the
Secretary of Commerce,

06:54.993 --> 06:56.392
with all that
nailed down,

06:56.427 --> 06:58.060
then we might be
all right, yeah.

06:58.096 --> 07:00.830
Everything good?

07:00.865 --> 07:02.498
You want to be
more vague?

07:02.533 --> 07:04.333
With you and Jeannie.

07:04.369 --> 07:06.002
I mean, you're not
sitting next to each other.

07:06.037 --> 07:07.536
She's got her headphones on;
she only does that

07:07.572 --> 07:08.571
- when she's pissed off.
- Hey, Clyde.

07:08.606 --> 07:10.339
So, mind my own
fucking business.

07:10.375 --> 07:11.641
Copy that. You got it.

07:11.676 --> 07:13.242
- <i>Bueno.</i>
- Sorry. <i>Bueno.</i>

07:13.278 --> 07:15.411
<i>Bueno.</i>

07:15.446 --> 07:16.479
What about you though?

07:16.514 --> 07:17.980
Hmm?

07:18.016 --> 07:19.815
What are you gonna do
with all that cheddar?

07:20.752 --> 07:22.585
All the time
on your hands?

07:22.620 --> 07:23.920
- You mean if we win this thing?
- Correct.

07:24.956 --> 07:27.223
Guess I'd live the dream.

07:27.258 --> 07:29.392
What does that
look like?

07:29.427 --> 07:32.061
I have no fucking idea.

07:32.096 --> 07:33.596
- Correct.
- Guys?

07:33.631 --> 07:35.865
I'd probably build houses for
people who can't afford houses.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.133
That's probably me, right?

07:37.168 --> 07:38.134
- No, I don't...
- Guys?

07:38.169 --> 07:39.502
- Oh, no, I'm not gonna do that.
- No.

07:39.537 --> 07:40.603
I'm definitely not gonna do
that. Sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:40.638 --> 07:42.071
- Guys!
- What?

07:43.107 --> 07:45.274
Oh, fuck.

07:48.613 --> 07:50.780
Oh, memory, please
do not hit "record."

07:50.815 --> 07:52.281
I got it.
Don't even worry about it.

07:52.317 --> 07:53.416
Thank you, Ambien.

07:53.451 --> 07:55.351
Isn't this one
of those situations

07:55.386 --> 07:56.686
where, you know,
we should

07:56.721 --> 07:58.254
say something to save him
the embarrassm...

07:58.289 --> 07:59.255
- No!
- No! No, no.

07:59.290 --> 08:01.057
I wonder if we'll have time

08:01.092 --> 08:02.692
to see Ernest
Hemingway's house.

08:02.727 --> 08:04.360
That simpleton?

08:04.395 --> 08:06.329
Seriously, Doug?
Ernest Hemingway?

08:06.364 --> 08:07.964
All those
five-word sentences?

08:07.999 --> 08:09.565
"Word senten..."
That's a five-word sentence!

08:09.600 --> 08:10.833
- So pretentious.
- Two-word sentence.

08:10.868 --> 08:12.435
- You cut the fat a bit.
- How about you guys shut

08:12.470 --> 08:14.337
- the fuck up and listen, okay?
- Sheez.

08:14.372 --> 08:16.539
Guy we're meeting is
named Samuel Orozco.

08:16.574 --> 08:19.475
Zobel seems to think
he's a real asset, okay?

08:19.510 --> 08:21.544
Managed to make a pretty good
dent in the marketplace here.

08:21.579 --> 08:23.212
Yeah, but a dent's not gonna
do it for the Kohl brothers.

08:23.247 --> 08:24.413
They're gonna want to eat
Cuba for breakfast.

08:24.449 --> 08:26.182
And we are going to feed
it to them, all of it.

08:26.217 --> 08:27.783
Oh, kind of like
how you fed your tongue

08:27.819 --> 08:29.752
to Granny on the plane.
Do you remember?

08:29.787 --> 08:31.153
- Oh, God, ugh.
- Mmm.

08:31.189 --> 08:33.456
Look, I don't remember too much,
thanks to the Ambien,

08:33.491 --> 08:35.691
but what I do remember
was pretty hot.

08:35.727 --> 08:37.827
Ah, I don't know. She kind of
made a beeline for the exit

08:37.861 --> 08:38.828
the second we landed.

08:38.863 --> 08:40.962
Where are you,
my sweet mystery lover?

08:40.999 --> 08:42.832
Ah, probably dead of
natural causes by now.

08:42.866 --> 08:45.067
- Oh! Let's go that way.
- Okay.

08:46.104 --> 08:47.370
So what does phase one

08:47.405 --> 08:49.205
of your Kohl brothers
project look like, Doug?

08:49.240 --> 08:52.308
Well, my initial projection
is 18 hotels and resorts,

08:52.343 --> 08:53.642
four of their hotel brands

08:53.678 --> 08:55.678
across all the mid-to-upper
price points.

08:55.713 --> 08:58.347
Ooh, I'll take a hotel
on Atlantic, Pennsylvania

08:58.383 --> 09:00.049
and Park-o Place-o,
<i>por favor.</i>

09:00.084 --> 09:01.650
You know what?
A fun Cuba fact

09:01.686 --> 09:03.552
is that the classic
Parker Brothers game Monopoly

09:03.588 --> 09:04.687
is actually illegal here.

09:04.722 --> 09:06.489
Wow. Irrelevant and
who gives a fuck?

09:06.524 --> 09:07.723
- Well...
- You really think

09:07.759 --> 09:09.058
if we kiss this guy
into the deal,

09:09.093 --> 09:10.292
he'll help us
make this happen?

09:10.328 --> 09:11.327
- Well, we'll see.
- Marty!

09:11.362 --> 09:12.661
I mean, you got another play?

09:27.078 --> 09:29.011
You feel it?

09:29.047 --> 09:31.380
Uh, well, I feel...

09:31.416 --> 09:33.149
You feel something.

09:33.184 --> 09:35.151
But you're no longer
really on point.

09:35.186 --> 09:37.420
Your agenda is cloudy.

09:37.455 --> 09:39.388
You have a feeling that
you left something behind,

09:39.424 --> 09:41.857
but in that way where you really
have no idea what that thing

09:41.893 --> 09:43.492
- that you left behind is.
- Yes.

09:43.528 --> 09:45.227
Oh, my God,
get out of my head,

09:45.263 --> 09:46.829
- Cuba man.
- Okay.

09:46.864 --> 09:48.631
That's very accurate,
but I am also

09:48.666 --> 09:49.965
a little bit drunk, so...

09:50.001 --> 09:51.333
Me three.

09:51.369 --> 09:52.701
It's this place.

09:52.737 --> 09:54.703
For good and bad,
it'll redirect you.

09:54.739 --> 09:56.806
Let me guess...
you've done your little

09:56.841 --> 09:58.307
consultant regression models

09:58.342 --> 10:01.310
that project that you can
build this many hotels

10:01.345 --> 10:02.812
and lease this much land,

10:02.847 --> 10:04.814
and that your market growth
will be equal "X"

10:04.849 --> 10:06.715
and that your profit
will be "Y," yes?

10:06.751 --> 10:08.317
Well...

10:08.352 --> 10:09.185
Pretty much.

10:09.220 --> 10:10.519
Yes.

10:10.555 --> 10:11.854
Well, here's the thing.

10:11.889 --> 10:14.557
All of that...
throw it in the ocean.

10:14.592 --> 10:16.759
You can't quantify
anything here.

10:16.794 --> 10:19.562
In Cuba, nothing will go
the way you think.

10:19.597 --> 10:22.231
Nothing will match
your charts and projections.

10:22.266 --> 10:25.768
If you want to do business here,
you have to surrender.

10:25.803 --> 10:28.737
The guiding worldview
of contemporary Cuba:

10:28.773 --> 10:31.407
<i>"No es fácil."</i>

10:31.442 --> 10:33.409
"It's not easy."

10:35.646 --> 10:38.581
Nothing here right now is easy.

10:38.616 --> 10:42.585
That doesn't mean that it's
not worthwhile or good,

10:42.620 --> 10:44.954
just... that it's not easy.

10:44.989 --> 10:47.423
And that's after you
turn yourself inside out.

10:49.127 --> 10:52.962
Everything that you believe in
and you stake your business on,

10:52.997 --> 10:54.864
here it's a bad word.

10:54.899 --> 10:58.868
"Capitalism," "free markets,"
"trickle-down economics."

10:58.903 --> 11:03.439
Cuba exposes all of that for
the pile of bullshit that it is.

11:03.474 --> 11:05.808
So...

11:05.843 --> 11:07.476
So sometimes
it'll be a disaster,

11:07.512 --> 11:08.777
and sometimes it won't.

11:08.813 --> 11:11.881
Sometimes you'll
be so happy that you cry.

11:11.916 --> 11:15.618
But none of it... none of it...
will be what you expect.

11:15.653 --> 11:20.089
Señor, uh, everything
in business is quantifiable.

11:20.124 --> 11:22.091
Assuming that there is
a series of constants.

11:22.126 --> 11:24.593
But in Cuba,
the only constant...

11:24.629 --> 11:26.228
Is that nothing is constant.

11:26.264 --> 11:28.097
<i>La rubia</i> wins the prize.

11:28.132 --> 11:31.100
<i>Bueno.</i> Enjoy the rest
of your evening.

11:31.135 --> 11:33.769
Tomorrow, the leasing company.

11:33.804 --> 11:35.271
<i>Buena noche.</i>

11:35.306 --> 11:37.173
Uh, <i>buena noche.</i>

11:39.210 --> 11:41.177
<i>So we walk out
of this morning's meeting</i>

11:41.212 --> 11:42.678
with a commitment
for the long-term leases.

11:42.713 --> 11:44.013
And we walk that
into the big meeting

11:44.048 --> 11:45.347
with Commerce tomorrow.

11:45.383 --> 11:46.682
We're prepared.
Why do I feel dread?

11:46.717 --> 11:48.017
Guys, we're late.
All right, showtime.

11:48.052 --> 11:49.385
- Ready?
- <i>Listos.</i>

11:51.055 --> 11:52.354
Fuck.

11:52.390 --> 11:53.689
Didn't even finish the pitch.

11:53.724 --> 11:55.357
Well, that was horrible.

11:55.393 --> 11:56.692
Our meeting
with the Commerce people

11:56.727 --> 11:58.694
has to go better than that.

11:58.729 --> 12:01.030
Fucking shit show.

12:01.065 --> 12:03.499
- Marty...
- I know. I know.

12:03.534 --> 12:05.501
<i>"No es fácil."</i>

12:05.536 --> 12:07.169
How did you think
it would go, eh?

12:07.205 --> 12:09.838
Did you think Cuba just spreads
her legs and lets you take her?

12:09.874 --> 12:11.173
Guess she's not
like Jeannie.

12:11.209 --> 12:12.875
Fuck you,
Clyde.

15:03.180 --> 15:05.147
Hey.

15:05.182 --> 15:06.482
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

15:06.517 --> 15:08.183
Hi. <i>Hola, hola.</i>

15:10.988 --> 15:12.855
Hi.

15:12.890 --> 15:15.057
Wow, look at this, huh?

15:15.092 --> 15:17.359
<i>Gracias,
gracias,</i> Pedro.

15:17.395 --> 15:19.962
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

15:19.997 --> 15:22.297
Do you have any
idea where we are?

15:22.333 --> 15:23.665
Yeah, lost.

15:44.455 --> 15:47.089
Hey, you know what, I think it's
around the corner back here.

15:47.124 --> 15:48.323
- Let's... let's go this way.
- <i>Hola.</i>

15:48.359 --> 15:49.992
No, thank you.

15:50.027 --> 15:51.326
Hey.

15:51.362 --> 15:52.661
Hello, Jeannie?
Let's go.

15:52.696 --> 15:54.363
No.

15:54.398 --> 15:57.032
What do you mean "no"? We're...

15:57.067 --> 15:58.700
We're in the middle
of somebody's wedding.

15:58.736 --> 16:00.335
You understand that? Okay?

16:00.371 --> 16:01.670
A bunch of people
you don't even know.

16:01.705 --> 16:03.672
Maybe I want to be here, Marty.

16:03.707 --> 16:05.340
Maybe I want to be in
the middle of this wedding,

16:05.376 --> 16:07.776
because these people seem
very happy, and I'm not.

16:07.812 --> 16:09.445
Great, so you want
to stay here at a wedding

16:09.480 --> 16:11.713
that we weren't invited to and
hang out with a bunch of people

16:11.749 --> 16:13.382
- that we don't know?
- Yes, asshole!

16:13.417 --> 16:14.450
Yes!

16:14.485 --> 16:15.784
I do.

16:15.820 --> 16:17.119
And I'm going
to stay here,

16:17.154 --> 16:19.455
and I'm gonna dance with
these beautiful people,

16:19.490 --> 16:22.124
and if you don't
like it, tough shit.

16:22.159 --> 16:24.793
Go back to the hotel
and review your spreadsheets.

16:24.829 --> 16:26.929
Jesus, Jeannie, why don't
you stop being so dramatic

16:26.964 --> 16:28.130
right now.

16:28.165 --> 16:30.098
Fuck you, Marty!

16:30.134 --> 16:31.934
Fuck you!

16:33.270 --> 16:34.570
Hi.

16:36.607 --> 16:37.940
Yes, thank you.

16:49.653 --> 16:51.286
Oh, you...

16:51.322 --> 16:53.422
you're very naughty.

16:53.457 --> 16:55.290
Ah, you're very drunk.

16:57.294 --> 16:59.261
Perfect relationship.

17:01.632 --> 17:06.234
So, Martydaddy, are you
gonna fuck my thing up?

17:06.270 --> 17:08.237
'Cause I worked really
hard on this acquisition,

17:08.271 --> 17:10.739
and I feel like I won
fair and square.

17:10.773 --> 17:13.242
Oh, God, honestly,
Monica, I am over it.

17:13.277 --> 17:15.109
Really, I'm over it.

17:15.145 --> 17:18.247
I mean, Cuba was never gonna go
for the Kohl brothers, right?

17:18.281 --> 17:19.915
- Fuck it, really.
- Yeah.

17:19.950 --> 17:21.916
Listen,
I like it here.

17:21.952 --> 17:22.917
I like the people.

17:22.953 --> 17:25.521
I-I like
the-the music.

17:25.556 --> 17:28.190
The food,
the culture, everything.

17:28.224 --> 17:30.792
I-I... I like the pace,
the slow, sustainable growth.

17:30.828 --> 17:32.127
Oh, really?

17:32.162 --> 17:34.329
'Cause I like rapid growth.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.366
And that is a great example
of rapid growth.

17:38.435 --> 17:40.269
But nobody goes
from zero to hero

17:40.304 --> 17:41.336
like the Chinese, though.

17:41.372 --> 17:42.738
- Am I right?
- Nobody.

17:42.773 --> 17:45.374
<i>Ch-China no pro-problemo
comunista.</i>

17:45.409 --> 17:47.042
I mean, sure,
they've got billions of people,

17:47.077 --> 17:48.510
but it's not about that.

17:48.546 --> 17:50.512
It is about a willingness,

17:50.548 --> 17:53.849
a willingness to fully
exploit your labor force,

17:53.884 --> 17:55.217
your natural resources.

17:55.252 --> 17:59.555
It is a willingness to actively,
aggressively deregulate

17:59.590 --> 18:03.258
and reach a climate
of maximum growth potential.

18:03.294 --> 18:05.594
Are you saying it exactly
like I'm saying it?

18:05.629 --> 18:06.728
I try.

18:06.764 --> 18:08.397
Of course.

18:08.432 --> 18:11.833
My clients, the Kohl brothers,
can make this happen for you

18:11.869 --> 18:16.171
by rolling out the most
extensive private capital

18:16.206 --> 18:19.775
foreign investment plan
in contemporary history.

18:19.810 --> 18:21.777
That's enough.

18:21.812 --> 18:23.612
Okay.

18:26.083 --> 18:27.349
<i>Sí.</i>

18:27.384 --> 18:29.284
This is...

18:29.320 --> 18:33.188
an affront to everything
we stand... for...

18:33.223 --> 18:35.023
I'm sorry, I can't,
I can't hear you.

18:35.059 --> 18:37.025
...and on top of that,
it's a bad business.

18:37.061 --> 18:38.393
- We're finished.
- "About business"?

18:38.429 --> 18:41.263
No, no, I don't think you
understand what I'm saying.

18:41.298 --> 18:43.231
- It's, uh, <i>bueno</i> business.
- What I... in... conversely,

18:43.267 --> 18:44.566
what I'm trying
to say is that...

18:44.602 --> 18:45.601
Told you they'd
never go for it.

18:45.636 --> 18:46.702
Bullshit.

18:46.737 --> 18:48.570
...China is
the opposite model

18:48.606 --> 18:50.038
of what we want
to pursue here in Cuba.

18:50.074 --> 18:51.039
- Calling me a liar?
- I think that

18:51.075 --> 18:52.274
- it's getting lost in transla...
- Liar.

18:52.309 --> 18:53.775
I don't know if you're,
I don't know if you're saying it

18:53.811 --> 18:56.411
- exactly like I'm saying it.
- Maybe I am, fuckhead.

18:56.447 --> 18:58.213
I can hear you. I can hear you,
and I don't know if it's...

18:58.248 --> 19:01.550
Nobody calls me a liar without
spilling some blood, liar.

19:01.585 --> 19:02.651
Well, maybe we need...

19:02.686 --> 19:05.420
you and me need to spill
some fucking blood...

19:05.456 --> 19:06.655
Fucking motherfucker.

19:06.690 --> 19:07.656
Liar.

19:07.691 --> 19:09.458
Uh, <i>siéntate, por favor.</i>

19:09.493 --> 19:10.459
No, it's just...

19:14.531 --> 19:15.430
Don't translate
what they're saying.

19:15.466 --> 19:16.398
Just stick with what I'm saying.

19:16.433 --> 19:18.900
What I'm saying is, China...

19:18.936 --> 19:21.169
Come back. Okay...

19:21.205 --> 19:23.071
- Yeah, yeah, you want to go?!
- Fucking liar, I'll fuck you up!

19:23.107 --> 19:24.973
- You want to fucking go?
- Progress is the enemy

19:25.009 --> 19:26.475
in-in that way.

19:31.215 --> 19:33.949
China is not the focus.

19:35.319 --> 19:36.685
Fucking Marty.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.134
No, no, no,
no, no, no!

19:52.169 --> 19:53.735
Fucking Marty!

19:53.771 --> 19:54.770
You fuck!

20:20.130 --> 20:22.097
That's great, thanks.

20:22.132 --> 20:23.832
- This is good.
- I like it here.

20:25.569 --> 20:28.303
Yeah, it's nice.

20:28.338 --> 20:30.405
No, I mean...

20:30.441 --> 20:33.075
here, you know, Cuba.

20:33.110 --> 20:35.077
Oh.

20:35.112 --> 20:37.746
Yeah.

20:37.781 --> 20:39.481
It's nice, too.

20:41.385 --> 20:43.218
But it doesn't want
the Kohls, does it?

20:43.253 --> 20:46.088
18 brand-new
luxury hotels...

20:47.825 --> 20:49.591
...golf courses, Starbucks,

20:49.626 --> 20:52.160
fucking TGI Fridays.

20:53.197 --> 20:55.363
Would you want that for it?

20:59.636 --> 21:01.737
Ah, fuck.

21:04.708 --> 21:08.543
Yeah, fuck.

21:08.579 --> 21:10.612
<i>No es</i> fucking <i>fácil.</i>

21:10.647 --> 21:12.047
Mm-mm.

21:13.550 --> 21:16.284
<i>Cuba was never gonna go
for the Kohl brothers, right?</i>

21:16.320 --> 21:18.019
Fuck it, really.

21:18.055 --> 21:20.055
And you know what?
I like it here.

21:20.090 --> 21:23.759
I like the people and the,
the food, the music,

21:23.794 --> 21:25.060
culture... all of it.

21:25.095 --> 21:26.294
I like the pace.

21:26.330 --> 21:27.929
The slow,
sustainable growth?

21:27.965 --> 21:29.030
Oh, really?

21:29.066 --> 21:31.266
'Cause I like rapid growth.

21:41.178 --> 21:42.244
Mm-hmm.

21:42.279 --> 21:43.745
Ah...

21:43.781 --> 21:45.380
No, no, no, no, look.

21:45.415 --> 21:46.448
This...

21:46.483 --> 21:48.350
You don't want...

21:48.385 --> 21:50.318
you-you got what you want.

21:50.354 --> 21:51.753
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.

21:51.789 --> 21:54.156
- Huh.
- It's another one of your tells.

21:54.191 --> 21:55.457
What is that?

21:55.492 --> 21:56.258
Not fucking me.

22:01.632 --> 22:03.064
Thank you.

22:04.101 --> 22:05.767
You're welcome.

22:05.803 --> 22:07.435
<i>So you told her the truth?</i>

22:07.471 --> 22:09.104
Told her the truth.

22:09.139 --> 22:10.138
And now we just...

22:10.174 --> 22:11.840
- That is correct.
- Mmm...

22:11.875 --> 22:13.575
Wait, I'm confused.

22:13.610 --> 22:15.243
I told her the truth.

22:15.279 --> 22:17.846
And now we are
going to tell her

22:17.881 --> 22:20.115
- "the truth."
- On Opposite Day.

22:20.150 --> 22:21.283
Oh, Opposite Day!

22:21.318 --> 22:23.351
- I love Opposite Day.
- Ding, ding, ding.

22:23.387 --> 22:25.754
- I mean I hate Opposite Day.
- Ding, ding, ding!

22:25.789 --> 22:28.023
Feed her an e-mail
that she will promptly hack.

22:28.058 --> 22:29.424
See, you're welcome.

22:29.459 --> 22:31.193
If it weren't
for my intellectual curiosity,

22:31.228 --> 22:32.994
we would never be able
to manipulate Monica like this.

22:33.030 --> 22:33.995
Oh, my God.

22:34.031 --> 22:35.664
- "Intellectual curiosity"?
- Yes.

22:35.699 --> 22:36.865
Are you fucking kidding me?
You opened up dirty spam!

22:36.900 --> 22:38.133
You tried to jerk off
in the office!

22:38.168 --> 22:39.634
- To jerk off in the office.
- So sorry, Doug.

22:39.670 --> 22:40.969
Thank you for being
a horny idiot.

22:41.004 --> 22:42.337
You're a hero.

22:42.372 --> 22:44.306
We send the counter-hack
detailing how Cuba

22:44.341 --> 22:47.542
is in the mood
for a China-style, balls-out

22:47.578 --> 22:49.644
- expansion, everything.
- Yes.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.513
Just exploit the labor force.
Fuck the environment.

22:51.548 --> 22:53.114
Yep, all of that.

22:53.150 --> 22:54.216
And then we watch her.

22:54.251 --> 22:56.184
And then
we watch her...

22:57.855 --> 22:58.820
But wait, hold up.

22:58.856 --> 23:00.155
If that's a bad strategy,

23:00.190 --> 23:01.523
then what's our play,
because outside

23:01.558 --> 23:03.124
of some sexy details,
it's sounding an awful lot like

23:03.160 --> 23:05.126
- what we were going in with.
- Yeah.

23:05.162 --> 23:06.161
Yeah.

23:06.196 --> 23:07.462
Um...

23:07.497 --> 23:09.030
about that.

23:09.066 --> 23:10.465
Ooh...

23:10.500 --> 23:13.201
I think I'm gonna
like this very much.

23:13.237 --> 23:14.836
I fucking knew it.
I fucking knew it!

23:14.872 --> 23:16.872
So, just so I'm...
We're adjusting our strategy.

23:16.907 --> 23:20.308
No, dum-dum, we're not
selling to the Kohls.

23:20.344 --> 23:21.576
Wait, what?!

23:21.612 --> 23:23.078
On-on Opposite Day,
though, right?

23:23.113 --> 23:24.379
Doug, forget Opposite Day.

23:24.414 --> 23:26.014
Remember Opposite Day...
that's what you mean!

23:26.049 --> 23:27.716
- Doug, Doug, it's over.
- Remember Opposite Day!

23:27.751 --> 23:30.352
- No!
- It's over.

23:30.387 --> 23:32.053
Listen, Cuba was never
gonna go for any version

23:32.089 --> 23:33.388
of what the Kohl brothers want.

23:33.423 --> 23:35.023
And do you really want
to subject this country

23:35.058 --> 23:36.758
to that particular form of...

23:36.793 --> 23:38.426
aggressive imperialism?

23:38.462 --> 23:39.761
"Imperialism," really?

23:39.796 --> 23:41.396
Or is it just passion?

23:41.431 --> 23:43.598
I get it Dougie,
you want the money.

23:43.634 --> 23:46.401
- I will buy him out if he shuts the fuck up!
- Deal.

23:46.436 --> 23:49.170
- On Opposite Day.
- On Opposite Day.

24:41.658 --> 24:43.325
Jeannie.
Jeannie.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.592
Jeannie, Jeannie.

24:44.628 --> 24:46.761
What?

24:46.797 --> 24:49.130
I think you should marry me.

24:49.166 --> 24:51.099
That's not funny, Marty.

24:53.236 --> 24:54.803
God, you're such an emotionless
robot, that's not...

24:54.838 --> 24:57.639
I think
we should get married.

24:59.810 --> 25:01.910
I thought you were...

25:01.945 --> 25:03.144
No.

25:03.180 --> 25:04.412
I'm serious.

25:07.617 --> 25:10.652
You're asking me
to marry you right now?

25:10.687 --> 25:12.787
- I am.
- And you're not fucking with me?

25:12.823 --> 25:14.422
No.

25:14.458 --> 25:16.825
I'm not.

25:19.029 --> 25:20.996
Okay.

25:21.031 --> 25:24.332
O-Okay, you get that I'm not
fucking with you or...?

25:24.368 --> 25:26.167
Okay, yes, okay.

25:26.203 --> 25:28.703
I would like to marry you.

25:33.076 --> 25:35.944
But I think
we should acknowledge that,

25:35.979 --> 25:38.813
that we, we are...

25:38.849 --> 25:40.382
Y-Yeah,
we're working people.

25:40.417 --> 25:42.751
- We will, we...
- We work, we, we work.

25:42.786 --> 25:44.552
We, uh...

25:44.588 --> 25:46.287
We work.

25:46.323 --> 25:47.889
We're not gonna
sell the business

25:47.924 --> 25:51.226
that we worked our asses off
to build all these years.

25:51.261 --> 25:53.228
Not yet.

25:53.263 --> 25:55.230
We're not gonna just
stay home and raise a kid.

25:55.265 --> 25:57.832
That's nothing
to be ashamed of.

25:57.868 --> 26:00.168
I mean, it won't be easy,
but we can, we can do both.

26:00.203 --> 26:01.569
That's right.

26:01.605 --> 26:03.805
So I guess we tell
the Kohl brothers...

26:03.840 --> 26:05.707
To fuck off.

26:05.742 --> 26:07.375
I mean, in better words
than that,

26:07.411 --> 26:08.810
but yeah.

26:08.845 --> 26:11.012
Okay.

26:11.048 --> 26:13.014
Yeah.

26:15.419 --> 26:16.851
I love you, Jeannie.

27:06.036 --> 27:07.335
Oh, shit!

27:07.370 --> 27:08.470
Watch your briefcases, guys!

27:08.505 --> 27:09.604
Marty, please, please!
Just two minutes.

27:09.639 --> 27:10.738
- Oh...
- Two minutes!

27:10.774 --> 27:12.407
Okay, but I smell
some despair.

27:12.442 --> 27:14.409
Yeah, I smell it now.

27:14.444 --> 27:15.777
- Pungent.
- Ha, ha, I get it, listen.

27:15.812 --> 27:17.612
Now, I don't blame you
for rubbing my nose in it.

27:17.647 --> 27:19.347
I really don't...
Marty, I have a real offer!

27:19.382 --> 27:20.682
- Aw.
- No.

27:20.717 --> 27:22.117
- But, look, the Kohl brothers...
- Skipper, Jesus Christ.

27:22.152 --> 27:23.384
- Sorry, excuse me.
- Just go, will you?

27:23.420 --> 27:25.553
The Kohl-Kohl brothers
know you're the guy.

27:25.589 --> 27:27.222
They've...
they've always known it.

27:27.257 --> 27:29.224
What about this?
I bring you back

27:29.259 --> 27:31.926
in the door
and then we-we, we both win!

27:31.962 --> 27:34.762
- We all win, we all...
- Yeah, I mean, we all would win.

27:34.798 --> 27:37.098
The problem is,
you don't lose, you know?

27:37.134 --> 27:39.167
And you see,
my old fuck buddy,

27:39.202 --> 27:41.035
your losing is
tantamount to a win.

27:41.071 --> 27:43.071
You see, Skip?

27:43.106 --> 27:44.472
- It's win-win-lose.
- Yeah.

27:44.508 --> 27:46.307
It's a win for you.

27:46.343 --> 27:48.810
- On Opposite Day.
- On Opposite Day.

27:48.845 --> 27:49.878
<i>Vámonos, señor.</i>

27:49.913 --> 27:51.079
- All right, Skip.
- <i>Adiós, Skip.</i>

27:51.114 --> 27:53.148
Fantastic to see you, buddy.

28:34.457 --> 28:37.158
What?

28:37.194 --> 28:39.694
Oh, Marty.

28:44.834 --> 28:47.936
Good morning, Mrs. Kaan.

28:53.109 --> 28:55.510
Marty, did you marry me
last night?

28:55.545 --> 28:58.146
Yep, yep, I think I might've.

29:04.087 --> 29:06.955
Did you steal
this car last night?

29:06.990 --> 29:09.490
Uh...

29:09.526 --> 29:11.059
no, that was you.

29:11.094 --> 29:13.528
You stole the car.

29:17.801 --> 29:19.867
Oh.

29:42.659 --> 29:45.293
<i>Sí.</i>
