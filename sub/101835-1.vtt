WEBVTT

00:48.309 --> 00:50.836
There goes my perfectly
clean criminal record.

00:58.645 --> 01:03.091
It's not the only thing
about you that's perfect.

01:03.124 --> 01:05.267
Fuck me, this is wicked.

01:06.677 --> 01:08.692
Maddie, let's go, Madds.

01:23.571 --> 01:25.267
Can't go down.

01:25.298 --> 01:27.443
You're abducted.

01:27.475 --> 01:30.771
This is the best thing
that's happened all year.

01:30.802 --> 01:31.858
Holly shit.

01:31.889 --> 01:33.842
You guys down for rum now?

01:33.873 --> 01:38.195
Has a drink in there
somewhere.

01:38.226 --> 01:39.697
Did you think car will be all
right?

01:46.225 --> 01:48.368
Yeah, we're in the middle of
nowhere.

01:48.401 --> 01:52.754
Yeah but, it's only brown
car, security and stuff.

01:52.785 --> 01:54.513
We'll be fine.

01:54.545 --> 01:55.697
You all right?

01:57.008 --> 01:58.513
Yeah.

01:58.545 --> 02:00.687
This place is great.

02:06.737 --> 02:08.592
We'll be in and out, an hour
or so.

02:08.624 --> 02:11.601
I'll go pick up the car, we
vamoose.

02:12.464 --> 02:14.544
Let's have a look around.

02:16.143 --> 02:17.328
We'll be fine.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.863
I'll just go make sure
they're not dead yet.

02:55.854 --> 02:56.781
Really Adam?

02:56.814 --> 02:57.645
What?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.437
I don't know, less noise
maybe.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.797
This abandoned fireworks here,

03:02.829 --> 03:05.003
where no one's been for
like a million years?

03:05.036 --> 03:07.661
No, in this creepy abandoned
facility,

03:07.692 --> 03:08.589
where nobody knows we are,

03:08.621 --> 03:10.220
and we're not supposed to be.

03:11.372 --> 03:12.747
And nobody's been for a million
years.

03:18.475 --> 03:20.076
You are so sexy right now.

03:28.396 --> 03:31.083
So, how far down do
you say this place is?

03:31.115 --> 03:33.067
I have no clue, 200 feet?

03:36.681 --> 03:40.394
You have no clue?

03:40.425 --> 03:41.867
What's that?

03:41.898 --> 03:44.874
This, Maddie is is 10
million candle power,

03:44.906 --> 03:48.842
of glorious high-intensity torch
light.

03:48.874 --> 03:49.930
Thought you knew all about
this place.

03:49.962 --> 03:51.113
Your was supposed to be the
expert.

03:51.145 --> 03:53.897
Adam, It's called exploring.

03:53.929 --> 03:56.553
I know.

04:01.225 --> 04:02.089
Wow.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.601
Ladies first.

04:09.832 --> 04:10.665
Cheers.

04:19.879 --> 04:21.128
Wait, you knew about this?

04:27.111 --> 04:29.255
You know it's cool.

04:31.398 --> 04:32.326
Transition a.

04:38.279 --> 04:39.494
What you doing?

04:39.527 --> 04:41.318
Drawing a map.

04:41.351 --> 04:42.950
How far do you think we've come?

04:43.845 --> 04:45.479
Good idea Madd.

04:45.510 --> 04:47.559
We did a left, then a right,
then a left.

04:54.566 --> 04:56.965
Make sure you mark down
everything we discover.

04:56.998 --> 04:58.118
This could be history.

05:05.477 --> 05:10.533
♪ How can I make you want me ♪

05:10.564 --> 05:15.588
♪ Half as much as I want you ♪

05:15.620 --> 05:20.612
♪ My heart of stone is happy ♪

05:21.380 --> 05:24.067
♪ Is there... ♪

05:25.059 --> 05:26.371
Shit, sorry.

05:26.404 --> 05:28.836
I just got close with the
biggest spider in the world.

05:28.867 --> 05:30.786
Fucking spider?

05:30.818 --> 05:32.291
I fell and one of the boxes
bit me.

05:32.324 --> 05:33.347
A spider bit you?

05:34.179 --> 05:36.259
No it's a box.

05:36.291 --> 05:38.979
Come Alex, is it deep?

05:39.011 --> 05:40.355
No, I'll live.

05:40.386 --> 05:41.955
Still have a blast or something.

05:47.619 --> 05:49.538
I still don't get why
they're punishing her now.

05:50.690 --> 05:52.739
We have to make an example of
her.

05:53.730 --> 05:56.705
Still, seems like overkill to
me.

05:56.736 --> 05:58.434
All those kids is still in
hospital.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.633
I thought they were from
the neighboring academy.

06:03.394 --> 06:04.225
They were.

06:08.288 --> 06:11.073
So that makes them at least
two years older than her.

06:12.064 --> 06:12.929
Those aren't Kids.

06:14.145 --> 06:15.744
Johnson, it was an exercise.

06:15.777 --> 06:17.121
That got out of hand.

06:17.152 --> 06:18.657
She's got a problem with
authority.

06:18.689 --> 06:20.384
Sounds like a day ruse to me.

06:22.655 --> 06:23.904
Shut up leftenant Johnson.

06:31.744 --> 06:32.575
I'll wait here.

06:38.143 --> 06:40.767
Sergeant Davies, it is.

06:42.782 --> 06:45.279
It's good to be here.

06:46.302 --> 06:49.119
And it is a pleasure to see
you, always.

06:52.542 --> 06:56.158
I know you are a man of
action so, to business?

07:00.286 --> 07:01.470
This,

07:10.909 --> 07:14.429
is to go with on your
forthcoming neutralization,

07:14.460 --> 07:15.837
and extraction mission.

07:35.771 --> 07:39.611
That contains a great deal of
information,

07:39.644 --> 07:42.235
which will be pertinent to
your forthcoming mission.

07:43.355 --> 07:44.187
In Latin.

07:46.235 --> 07:49.499
You object, because
it is perhaps too heavy?

07:49.531 --> 07:51.611
I'm sure I can arrange
someone to carry it for you.

07:51.642 --> 07:52.857
I object.

07:52.890 --> 07:55.003
I'm taking my team on a mission,

07:55.034 --> 07:58.714
where the only intel that
makes sense, is in Latin.

07:59.674 --> 08:01.402
The intel is solid.

08:01.434 --> 08:02.554
Respectfully.

08:06.458 --> 08:08.538
I was told this was an enemy

08:08.569 --> 08:10.618
of a small civilian group,

08:10.649 --> 08:14.105
who are going to penetrate
a company owned facility.

08:14.137 --> 08:17.401
Now why are we being sent in so
late?

08:17.433 --> 08:19.225
And what does this notebook
have to do with it?

08:19.257 --> 08:20.185
Sergeant Davies...

08:20.217 --> 08:22.169
I understand the need to keep

08:22.200 --> 08:23.897
something like this quiet...

08:23.928 --> 08:25.176
You understand nothing.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.408
Least of all the
importance of this mission.

08:30.936 --> 08:34.552
Please keep in mind that your
team is just one of many.

08:36.376 --> 08:39.383
And if this company is
failing to provide you,

08:39.416 --> 08:40.343
and the rest of Team Seven

08:40.376 --> 08:43.096
with adequate remuneration
for your services,

08:43.127 --> 08:44.216
then I hear The Circuit holds

08:44.247 --> 08:45.463
many lucrative opportunities

08:45.495 --> 08:48.055
to be shot up by rebels
or some such nonsense.

08:49.783 --> 08:53.462
Please, think of your daughter's
future.

08:57.174 --> 09:00.342
Sergeant Davies, please do not
confuse

09:00.374 --> 09:02.454
this company's government
affiliations,

09:02.486 --> 09:05.078
with working for the government.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.743
You are a private contractor,

09:07.990 --> 09:09.493
with a reputation For fine work,

09:09.526 --> 09:14.549
which should not be sullied
by asking too many questions.

09:18.389 --> 09:20.533
Imagine what a waste of your
team's talents it would be,

09:20.565 --> 09:22.965
if an opportunity like
this were to pass you by.

09:24.149 --> 09:28.532
The unusual skill set,
and unsavory histories

09:28.565 --> 09:30.420
of the men and women under your
command,

09:30.452 --> 09:32.596
do not lend themselves well

09:32.629 --> 09:35.732
to more conventional
occupations.

09:40.277 --> 09:41.619
Good read is it Sarge?

09:42.772 --> 09:45.267
Mostly pictures Matthews,
you'd like it.

09:57.299 --> 09:58.194
Come on.

09:58.227 --> 09:59.540
Yeah, stop working it.

09:59.570 --> 10:01.074
Okay

10:03.730 --> 10:04.530
Smile

10:30.513 --> 10:33.008
Am I Barack Obama?

10:33.042 --> 10:34.002
No.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.248
He's never gonna get it.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.104
He has self doubt, I'll have
got this.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.608
Yeah, right.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.689
Eight questions left, dipshit.

10:40.721 --> 10:42.191
Might as well be none.

10:42.224 --> 10:44.624
Respectfully sir, my
man's got this shit.

10:45.521 --> 10:48.559
Private Matthews, you
have eight questions left.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.414
Am I Janet Street-Porter?

10:54.447 --> 10:55.374
What the fuck is wrong with
you?

10:55.407 --> 10:56.176
Told you.

10:56.207 --> 10:57.008
How could you...

10:57.040 --> 10:58.510
You already asked if you were a
man.

10:58.543 --> 10:59.374
Seven.

10:59.407 --> 11:00.559
You already know you're a man.

11:00.590 --> 11:01.454
Are we playing a hunch?

11:01.487 --> 11:02.606
Fucking seven, happy now?

11:02.639 --> 11:03.694
There's no chance.

11:03.727 --> 11:06.126
Sir, I think your negativity,
is fucking up his chee.

11:06.158 --> 11:08.366
No amount of chee is
gonna make him smarter.

11:08.398 --> 11:09.487
Or a hunch?

11:09.519 --> 11:11.566
He doesn't even know who
Janet Street-Porter is.

11:11.597 --> 11:13.677
Yes he does, don't you?

11:14.606 --> 11:16.526
And I think he should be
allowed more questions.

11:16.557 --> 11:17.773
Does he even knows who Barack
Obama is?

11:17.806 --> 11:20.142
Piss off, can he have
more questions, why?

11:20.175 --> 11:21.421
Special dispensation.

11:21.453 --> 11:22.445
Of being a dipshit.

11:22.477 --> 11:23.405
How the hell is that fair?

11:23.437 --> 11:24.365
Quiet.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.293
We're going in cold here.

11:30.317 --> 11:32.301
Tracking unknown targets,

11:32.333 --> 11:34.636
into an unknown military
facility

11:34.669 --> 11:37.068
that's been abandoned for
reasons unknown.

11:38.732 --> 11:41.356
Do you know they wanted me to
pick a team?

11:41.388 --> 11:42.253
And I said, "No."

11:43.756 --> 11:45.260
You know why?

11:45.291 --> 11:46.860
Bell, do you know why I said no,

11:46.893 --> 11:48.108
when they said, "Sergeant
Davies,

11:48.139 --> 11:49.643
"We need you to pick a team."

11:49.676 --> 11:51.179
Sir, no, sir.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.732
Because I have the best
goddamn team on the circuit.

11:54.763 --> 11:58.026
I said, "They're the
fastest, the smartest,

11:58.059 --> 12:00.332
"the baddest team of
motherfucking killing machines,

12:00.363 --> 12:02.667
"you might ever have the
misfortune of meeting."

12:02.699 --> 12:03.530
Yes, sir.

12:04.362 --> 12:06.763
I said, "There's a
reason they're the best.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.162
"They've seen it all,
they've been through hell,

12:09.194 --> 12:11.530
"and they've dragged me back."

12:14.154 --> 12:15.305
And if dipshit here mistook

12:15.338 --> 12:17.738
the warm rocking motion of this
van,

12:17.771 --> 12:19.178
while his bee sting dick

12:19.209 --> 12:22.185
for a hunchback Janet
Street-Porter,

12:22.218 --> 12:23.209
that's his look out.

12:24.841 --> 12:26.473
Thank you Sarge.

12:34.248 --> 12:36.136
Why would she put bars in a
tunnel?

12:36.168 --> 12:38.056
The two run section of a

12:38.088 --> 12:40.105
part of the tunnel system that's
unsafe.

12:43.176 --> 12:44.968
Or you don't want people to go
down.

12:46.345 --> 12:49.449
Bars like these, are
for one of two reasons.

13:12.934 --> 13:14.950
Grace, are you coming?

13:47.973 --> 13:50.148
That's interesting init?

13:53.669 --> 13:56.003
Are you sure this it, Sarge?

13:56.867 --> 13:59.524
Sarge, tracks lead this way.

14:05.698 --> 14:07.108
What's it for?

14:07.140 --> 14:08.931
That's what I wanna know.

14:08.964 --> 14:10.691
A supply tunnel or something?

14:10.723 --> 14:14.819
No doors, no sign saying
how we've come, nothing.

14:19.074 --> 14:20.643
I'm okay.

14:36.545 --> 14:39.329
Shit, that wasn't weird at
all.

14:42.305 --> 14:44.033
Maybe these tunnels go
downwards,

14:44.064 --> 14:46.209
as well as out or along.

14:46.241 --> 14:47.073
Yeah, maybe.

14:48.385 --> 14:51.233
Come my ears keep
popping something wicked.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.639
Really?

14:52.672 --> 14:53.855
Mine are fine.

14:53.889 --> 14:55.041
Yeah.

14:55.072 --> 14:55.872
You okay?

14:55.905 --> 14:58.816
Yeah, just it was as if

14:58.848 --> 15:00.640
Do you guys not feel that?

15:00.672 --> 15:02.720
Oh, do you want a mint?

15:02.752 --> 15:04.127
It might help if your ear has a
problem.

15:04.159 --> 15:04.959
Thanks.

15:07.456 --> 15:08.895
I just shit myself.

15:10.655 --> 15:11.871
Is there a mint for that?

15:13.535 --> 15:16.287
Come on, that was just an
echo.

15:17.406 --> 15:18.911
From me shouting just now.

15:22.815 --> 15:24.254
Why are you whispering then?

15:27.646 --> 15:28.414
Cause Braveheart here

15:28.447 --> 15:29.470
has farted first.

15:29.503 --> 15:31.423
Piss off, I was joking, wasn't
I?

15:44.316 --> 15:46.460
Am I Lance Armstrong?

15:46.492 --> 15:47.581
Cut it out.

15:53.373 --> 15:55.100
Fucking cool.

15:58.397 --> 16:00.477
Okay, group shot.

16:00.507 --> 16:01.788
Let's go.

16:01.819 --> 16:04.252
Madds great, if you go
in the middle, that's it.

16:06.459 --> 16:08.314
Yeah, are you ready?

16:09.467 --> 16:10.588
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:10.620 --> 16:12.091
Okay.

16:12.123 --> 16:12.892
Ready, smile.

16:13.787 --> 16:15.034
Yeah, that's good.

16:15.067 --> 16:15.866
We ready?

16:15.898 --> 16:16.731
Yeah.

16:18.268 --> 16:19.130
Hey look at this.

16:21.307 --> 16:22.139
They're nice.

16:22.171 --> 16:23.291
You look great.

16:26.171 --> 16:27.355
Madds, you wanna see?

16:29.146 --> 16:30.297
You coming, though?

16:30.330 --> 16:31.739
Yeah, two secs.

16:46.616 --> 16:48.825
Beccs.

16:48.856 --> 16:49.689
Wait up, yeah.

17:00.055 --> 17:01.208
What the fuck?

17:07.384 --> 17:12.152
How is this place, coming
up with even more weird shit?

17:13.655 --> 17:16.439
That's not right, right?

17:16.470 --> 17:17.751
It's fucking brilliant.

17:18.999 --> 17:20.951
Like oh my God, I'm gonna shit
you up,

17:20.983 --> 17:23.031
and probably murder you
brilliant.

17:23.062 --> 17:24.631
Who put it there?

17:24.663 --> 17:26.359
Why did they put it there?

17:26.391 --> 17:28.631
And why is that light on?

18:11.315 --> 18:12.147
Oh shit.

18:15.828 --> 18:16.692
You all right?

18:17.715 --> 18:18.708
Did you see that?

18:19.890 --> 18:20.659
See what?

18:20.690 --> 18:22.292
Oh shit.

18:22.323 --> 18:24.339
Maybe there's a dodgy
connection somewhere.

18:24.372 --> 18:26.003
This place is ridiculous.

18:26.036 --> 18:27.378
I'm sorry I ever said it was
boring.

18:27.410 --> 18:28.243
Shut up Ad.

18:29.586 --> 18:33.043
Grace, are you all right?

18:33.074 --> 18:34.354
No, I don't think so.

18:34.385 --> 18:36.178
I think she needs a minute,
mate.

18:36.209 --> 18:38.802
Come on, can't you
see she's freaked out?

18:39.762 --> 18:41.651
No, no, no, no, no I'm fine I
just

18:42.482 --> 18:44.210
got a bit spooked in the dark.

18:44.242 --> 18:46.001
I thought I saw a....

18:56.208 --> 18:58.449
Base, this is Team Seven.

18:58.481 --> 19:00.080
We're entering the tunnel.

19:03.056 --> 19:04.657
Base, please repeat.

19:09.392 --> 19:10.256
Bell, anything?

19:11.376 --> 19:14.064
Sorry Sarge, I'll try again
here.

19:14.096 --> 19:15.375
What did the manual say?

19:15.407 --> 19:16.240
Piss off.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.808
Base, just say it again,
repeat.

19:30.926 --> 19:32.367
Looks like we're on our own.

19:32.399 --> 19:33.390
Won't be the first time.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.927
I want this clean and simple.

19:35.887 --> 19:37.902
We have five civilians down
here.

19:37.935 --> 19:38.766
Let's get moving.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.646
They've been here no more than
an hour.

19:41.678 --> 19:43.150
So they can't have gotten far.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.014
Taylor take point.

19:44.047 --> 19:45.358
Bell, you're with me.

19:45.390 --> 19:46.478
Keep trying base.

19:46.510 --> 19:48.973
Matthews, bring up the rear.

19:55.724 --> 19:58.542
There is something not
right about all of this.

19:58.572 --> 19:59.564
It's pretty weird.

20:01.293 --> 20:02.093
You know what I mean.

20:03.053 --> 20:04.459
Come on.

20:04.492 --> 20:06.412
And the lights being
on, and that weird noise.

20:06.444 --> 20:10.187
Come on, it can't be
that much further to go.

20:10.219 --> 20:11.821
Madds, you were drawing a map,
right?

20:11.852 --> 20:13.836
Well, how far have we come?

20:13.868 --> 20:15.500
Well, I only managed to get
through

20:15.532 --> 20:18.508
a couple of corners, and
then I sort of distracted.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.747
Help with that.

20:33.995 --> 20:34.795
What's it like?

20:34.827 --> 20:36.074
It's detailed.

20:36.106 --> 20:37.195
It's really not that great.

20:37.227 --> 20:40.715
Okay, let's just try
another couple of corners

20:40.746 --> 20:43.274
and if anything else weird
happens,

20:43.307 --> 20:45.067
we are out of here, right?

20:51.465 --> 20:53.482
Kiss the puss darling.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.887
Is that blood?

21:26.918 --> 21:28.072
Don't touch.

21:39.271 --> 21:41.413
I know you'd give it a lick
too.

21:47.398 --> 21:49.061
Move out.

21:59.205 --> 22:01.509
Okay, everyone keep still.

22:08.869 --> 22:09.893
Okay, ready.

22:11.076 --> 22:13.285
Okay you're gonna have to make a
hole.

22:15.365 --> 22:16.965
That's intrusive.

22:23.940 --> 22:24.708
Becca.

22:24.740 --> 22:26.244
Jesus, what the fuck?

22:26.276 --> 22:28.740
Wait, no, no we gotta stay
together.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.587
What the fuck is that?

22:31.620 --> 22:32.740
Maddie, Grace.

22:57.698 --> 22:58.786
Hold your fire.

23:00.162 --> 23:02.017
Stop fucking shooting.

23:04.897 --> 23:05.730
Enima.

23:11.489 --> 23:12.545
She went through here.

23:12.577 --> 23:13.472
What was that noise?

23:13.505 --> 23:14.657
I think it was gunfire.

23:14.688 --> 23:15.585
Becca is through here,

23:15.617 --> 23:16.673
there's nowhere else she could
be.

23:16.704 --> 23:18.784
I found her Maddie you
found her, didn't you?

23:18.817 --> 23:20.704
She was sucked into
the wall, or ceiling,

23:20.737 --> 23:21.824
she could be fucking anywhere.

23:21.856 --> 23:22.784
I know if it was true to the
fuck...

23:22.816 --> 23:24.608
Ad, that shit's not helpful.

23:24.640 --> 23:25.632
Becca is through here,

23:25.664 --> 23:27.008
and there's gun fire
coming from that direction.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.640
So help me get this door open.

23:29.696 --> 23:30.592
Now.

23:31.872 --> 23:33.920
What the fuck was that
Sergeant?

23:33.952 --> 23:36.288
Hold your fire and keep
your fucking heads together.

23:41.375 --> 23:43.455
Move up.

23:43.487 --> 23:45.183
Taylor, take a look.

24:08.222 --> 24:10.493
Sorry Sarge, nothing yet.

24:12.573 --> 24:13.757
Keep trying.

24:19.517 --> 24:21.276
All right, what the fuck just
happened?

24:21.309 --> 24:24.220
They were old soldiers firing
at us.

24:24.252 --> 24:26.717
Keep it locked down, both of
you.

24:27.740 --> 24:29.180
But we were taking fire.

24:29.212 --> 24:30.908
Taking fire, from who exactly?

24:30.940 --> 24:33.308
Sergeant, they were old
soldiers firing.

24:33.340 --> 24:35.005
Now who the fuck were
you firing at Mathews?

24:35.036 --> 24:37.243
They were old
soldiers.

24:38.267 --> 24:39.931
Jesus Christ.

24:42.715 --> 24:43.995
Report soldier.

24:46.139 --> 24:47.355
What did you see?

24:48.699 --> 24:49.755
I...

25:05.529 --> 25:06.522
- Shit.
- Shit.

25:06.554 --> 25:07.353
It's locked stuck solid.

25:07.386 --> 25:08.442
What we gonna do?

25:08.473 --> 25:09.818
We're gonna get through
this door, and find Becca.

25:09.850 --> 25:11.417
Okay.

25:11.450 --> 25:14.041
What we need, is a crowbar or
something.

25:14.073 --> 25:15.834
Where are we gonna
find a bloody crowbar?

25:15.865 --> 25:17.817
I don't know, but
this thing isn't moving.

25:19.513 --> 25:20.761
Quick, quick.

25:23.353 --> 25:24.601
What the fuck was that?

25:24.632 --> 25:26.073
Why do I know that sound?

25:28.088 --> 25:29.208
What are we gonna do?

25:29.240 --> 25:30.968
I don't want to die down here.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.280
Now, I've me your belt.

25:32.312 --> 25:33.112
What?

25:33.144 --> 25:34.168
G, What the fuck?

25:34.200 --> 25:35.224
Not a debate.

25:40.055 --> 25:41.623
Hold here.

25:41.655 --> 25:42.679
Don't let go.

25:42.712 --> 25:43.543
Right foot.

25:43.575 --> 25:44.376
Okay.

25:45.847 --> 25:47.863
Look, stump at three.

25:47.896 --> 25:49.816
One, two, three.

25:50.711 --> 25:53.143
Again, one, two, three.

26:17.077 --> 26:19.157
Motherfucker, fuck off.

26:20.373 --> 26:21.205
Fuck off.

26:27.318 --> 26:29.812
All right captain, Jesus
Christ.

26:29.845 --> 26:31.093
Fuck you.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.204
Fucking just die.

26:33.236 --> 26:34.740
Fuck you.

26:34.772 --> 26:35.604
Taylor.

26:37.140 --> 26:38.741
Bell.

26:38.773 --> 26:39.540
Fuck.

26:40.404 --> 26:41.236
Fuck.

26:41.268 --> 26:43.091
Again, one, two, three.

26:44.307 --> 26:46.291
One, two, three.

26:47.187 --> 26:47.988
Fuck yeah.

26:51.667 --> 26:52.467
Motherfuckers.

26:53.523 --> 26:55.411
Matthews take point, I
wanna clear run that way.

26:55.443 --> 26:56.274
Yes sir.

26:56.307 --> 26:57.107
Taylor, cover him.

26:57.138 --> 26:58.227
Pick off any strays.

26:58.258 --> 26:59.251
Sir.

27:01.619 --> 27:03.122
It fucking beat me Sarge.

27:06.066 --> 27:07.986
Can you fight, private?

27:09.170 --> 27:11.026
Sir, fuck yeah, sir.

27:12.275 --> 27:13.617
- Johnson.
- Sir.

27:13.650 --> 27:15.570
The private here needs a
strong arm.

27:20.979 --> 27:21.777
Ready?

27:21.809 --> 27:23.473
Let's go big boy

27:23.505 --> 27:25.137
Move out.

28:00.910 --> 28:02.863
Has this place been closed,
since like the fifties?

28:02.895 --> 28:04.239
That's some super-charge,

28:04.272 --> 28:06.478
long-life battery shit right
there.

28:12.590 --> 28:13.422
Becca.

28:14.350 --> 28:15.310
Jesus Christ.

28:15.342 --> 28:16.109
Bec...

28:16.142 --> 28:17.998
No, no, no, no, no.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.013
We'll find her, but quietly.

28:20.045 --> 28:21.997
We have to be quiet.

28:50.796 --> 28:51.627
Fuck.

28:56.108 --> 28:57.451
Hold position.

28:58.283 --> 29:01.419
I get the feeling we're being
herded.

29:01.451 --> 29:02.604
Where?

29:16.971 --> 29:17.770
Position X.

31:01.572 --> 31:02.947
The door.

31:07.747 --> 31:10.180
We can't hold it, go, go, go.

31:12.099 --> 31:12.995
Go, go, go.

31:25.795 --> 31:26.690
This way.

31:33.186 --> 31:34.114
Are you kidding?

31:34.146 --> 31:35.042
Turn that shit off.

31:35.074 --> 31:35.905
What shit?

31:35.937 --> 31:37.282
The music, somewhere in here.

31:37.314 --> 31:40.129
♪ Cause I thought ♪

31:40.162 --> 31:41.473
It's off.

31:41.505 --> 31:43.393
What music, you nutter.

31:43.425 --> 31:45.409
There's no music.

31:47.456 --> 31:49.376
You didn't hear that?

32:04.671 --> 32:05.792
I think we lost it.

32:05.824 --> 32:06.688
Oh yeah?

32:08.223 --> 32:10.078
Where are we?

32:10.111 --> 32:11.998
Another stairwell?

32:12.031 --> 32:15.294
Where did Adam and Grace go?

32:15.328 --> 32:16.575
I think they went right,

32:16.607 --> 32:17.696
we went left.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.575
Hopefully they are hidden
in a room somewhere.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.654
Should we go back?

32:22.686 --> 32:24.670
I don't know.

32:24.702 --> 32:27.071
I don't know what we're gonna
run into,

32:27.102 --> 32:28.191
whoever it was who is firing.

32:28.222 --> 32:30.079
I've got to go back.

32:31.549 --> 32:32.638
Okay, cool.

32:36.317 --> 32:38.814
There's no music playing, G.

32:41.438 --> 32:42.845
Taylor, keep it together.

32:45.053 --> 32:46.365
Sweep that room.

32:57.597 --> 32:58.396
Clear.

32:58.427 --> 33:01.372
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck.

33:36.697 --> 33:38.457
It bit me, Johnson.

33:47.001 --> 33:49.016
Don't let them grab you.

33:50.041 --> 33:51.896
Easy Bell, easy now.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.097
They change you.

34:02.105 --> 34:07.096
Don't let them take me.

34:08.056 --> 34:10.648
I'm here, I won't let you go.

34:44.342 --> 34:45.174
Sarge.

34:47.030 --> 34:47.861
Sarge.

34:50.357 --> 34:51.861
What the fuck is going on?

34:58.228 --> 35:00.597
I said, what the fuck is going
on Sarge?

35:00.629 --> 35:01.749
Stand down soldier.

35:01.781 --> 35:04.340
No, let him talk.

35:05.940 --> 35:08.117
What's on your mind, Taylor?

35:08.149 --> 35:11.988
What's on my mind.

35:15.124 --> 35:16.339
What's my mind?

35:20.339 --> 35:22.356
What's on my mind?

35:22.387 --> 35:24.467
I'll tell you what's on my
fucking mind.

35:24.499 --> 35:25.844
Just exactly what the fuck

35:25.874 --> 35:27.156
we're supposed to be doing down
here

35:27.187 --> 35:28.882
in the first place.

35:28.914 --> 35:30.195
This is no routine enemy.

35:31.698 --> 35:34.323
Now here we are, two men down,
trapped

35:34.355 --> 35:36.051
and barely escaping fire fights

35:36.083 --> 35:38.962
from, please correct me if I'm
wrong,

35:38.994 --> 35:41.682
ghost soldiers or some shit.

35:41.715 --> 35:42.771
Not to mention whatever the fuck

35:42.802 --> 35:45.265
those bandage-headed things are.

35:46.610 --> 35:47.953
Are you finished private?

35:59.121 --> 36:00.849
What's in the fucking book,
sir?

36:03.825 --> 36:05.872
Oh,

36:09.712 --> 36:10.609
There it is.

36:12.112 --> 36:14.449
I saw you checking those fucking
symbols,

36:14.480 --> 36:16.560
or runes, or whatever.

36:19.216 --> 36:21.072
What's in the fucking book,
Sarge?

36:28.592 --> 36:29.456
Well?

36:32.238 --> 36:35.022
The mission still stands.

36:35.054 --> 36:36.655
We complete the enemy,

36:36.686 --> 36:39.343
and we get the fuck out of here.

36:39.374 --> 36:40.238
Both clear?

36:40.271 --> 36:42.926
Yes sir.

36:42.958 --> 36:43.790
Yes sir.

36:46.254 --> 36:47.918
Johnson, pull up the monitor.

36:53.038 --> 36:54.862
Got something Sarge.

36:54.894 --> 36:56.366
I've got, Mathews.

36:58.060 --> 36:59.533
He keeps dropping in and out.

37:01.165 --> 37:01.932
Stop shaking it.

37:01.964 --> 37:03.469
I can't work this fucking
thing.

37:03.501 --> 37:05.389
- Bell would...
- There.

37:05.421 --> 37:07.213
He's moving, he's
alive.

38:26.056 --> 38:29.063
We're all going to die down
here.

38:38.119 --> 38:39.910
I've got something, Sarge.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.031
It keeps dropping in and out.

38:41.063 --> 38:41.991
Stop shaking it.

38:43.495 --> 38:44.743
I can't fucking work this
thing.

38:44.774 --> 38:45.670
Bell would...

38:45.703 --> 38:46.471
There.

38:48.358 --> 38:50.502
He's moving, he's alive.

38:53.990 --> 38:54.822
Oh no.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.062
Motherfuckers.

39:08.741 --> 39:09.733
Holly shit.

39:26.851 --> 39:28.163
What's it doing?

39:29.956 --> 39:31.395
It's recruiting.

39:40.227 --> 39:44.067
Turning Mathews into one of
those things.

39:59.042 --> 40:00.066
I've seen enough, Johnson.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.178
Store the monitor.

40:03.841 --> 40:05.122
Ready to move sir.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.305
What about Bell, Surge?

40:06.338 --> 40:09.057
We'll circle back for her,
we're not leaving her behind.

40:23.968 --> 40:25.280
Are they gone?

40:27.040 --> 40:28.288
I don't know.

40:30.528 --> 40:31.456
Stay there.

40:49.887 --> 40:51.167
They're gone.

40:51.199 --> 40:52.286
Thank fuck.

40:56.064 --> 40:57.342
What are we going to do?

40:57.375 --> 40:58.622
I don't know.

40:59.486 --> 41:01.694
What do you think enemy means?

41:01.726 --> 41:06.814
No clue, but I don't think
this is all going to plan.

41:06.845 --> 41:08.349
No better thing to know
what those things are,

41:08.382 --> 41:09.950
anymore than we do.

41:09.981 --> 41:11.070
I think they're down here for
them,

41:11.101 --> 41:12.734
I think they are not here for
us.

41:14.653 --> 41:15.709
We need to find Steve, and
Maddie,

41:15.741 --> 41:17.340
and Becca and get out of here.

41:17.373 --> 41:18.908
I'm not okay going with you.

41:18.941 --> 41:20.573
This morning we were in a cafe,

41:20.605 --> 41:24.028
and now we're in a room with a
dead body.

41:24.060 --> 41:27.676
I know, this place is...

41:27.709 --> 41:28.508
Fucked up.

41:28.540 --> 41:29.372
Yeah.

41:30.460 --> 41:32.796
Like emergency red
lighting, there's sirens.

41:32.828 --> 41:34.812
Actually, why the lights even on
at all?

41:36.060 --> 41:37.499
What you on, G?

41:38.652 --> 41:39.739
What sirens?

43:08.118 --> 43:09.110
Shit shit.

44:03.570 --> 44:05.779
It's going wayback.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.282
Yeah.

44:07.314 --> 44:10.418
What you do if it's inside of
that room?

44:10.450 --> 44:14.642
Maybe we can wait for
it to leave, or something.

44:27.761 --> 44:30.225
Look, we can't go through, or
round.

44:31.664 --> 44:32.624
But we can go over.

44:35.121 --> 44:36.368
Wait.

44:36.401 --> 44:38.192
What about the walkie talkies?

44:38.224 --> 44:40.368
I turned those off.

44:40.400 --> 44:41.489
What if they are hiding like us,

44:41.521 --> 44:43.248
and one of those things is
nearby?

44:44.208 --> 44:45.936
We can give them away by
accident.

44:52.623 --> 44:55.375
Madds, Adam's gonna be all
right.

44:56.976 --> 44:58.223
Yeah, I know.

45:00.271 --> 45:02.222
He's with Grace.

45:02.255 --> 45:05.231
No, I don't remember
any flashing red lights,

45:05.262 --> 45:06.830
or hearing any random creepy
music

45:06.863 --> 45:08.558
coming from the walls.

45:08.590 --> 45:10.191
Or having any other kind
of mental breakdown.

45:10.223 --> 45:12.175
Yeah, that's right.

45:12.207 --> 45:13.518
I am not having a mental
breakdown.

45:13.550 --> 45:15.438
Are you off your pills?

45:15.470 --> 45:16.430
And when did this sudden door,

45:16.462 --> 45:17.550
the light in the end of the
tunnel,

45:17.581 --> 45:20.782
this random door you saw in
the middle of the tunnel,

45:20.814 --> 45:22.189
while the rest of us vanished?

45:22.222 --> 45:24.461
I don't know, it's just a
door.

45:26.574 --> 45:28.237
I know it's a cell door.

45:33.197 --> 45:36.813
Grace, your
freaking me out, yeah?

45:38.733 --> 45:39.981
I can't move.

45:42.957 --> 45:47.276
Something's holding me
here, but I can't see it.

45:47.308 --> 45:49.132
Grace, Grace, Grace.

45:52.236 --> 45:53.740
I want to go home.

45:56.396 --> 45:57.643
Me too shit head.

46:01.899 --> 46:05.035
Sis, okay now this is freaking
me out.

46:07.435 --> 46:09.451
Try the walkie talkies,
just to see if that is on.

46:09.482 --> 46:10.763
Okay.

46:10.795 --> 46:12.811
Turn the volume down.

46:12.843 --> 46:14.090
Just let me know if it happens
again,

46:14.122 --> 46:16.330
or something though, yeah?

46:16.363 --> 46:19.307
It's okay, just tell me.

46:41.993 --> 46:43.401
It's not my fault.

47:05.512 --> 47:08.135
Let me know if anything
else weird happens, yeah?

47:13.287 --> 47:14.119
Promise.

47:19.270 --> 47:20.743
Okay.

47:20.775 --> 47:22.406
I've got nothing in these.

47:23.333 --> 47:24.997
I bet that Steve turned his off.

47:25.030 --> 47:27.749
No, that's not gonna keep
them away if they're hiding.

47:27.781 --> 47:29.446
Yeah, I guess.

47:29.478 --> 47:31.110
Let's try the other door.

47:31.142 --> 47:32.613
You know it's still gonna be
locked.

47:41.125 --> 47:42.054
I'm hungry.

47:43.653 --> 47:44.485
Cheers.

47:50.533 --> 47:51.524
So why didn't you say anything
earlier

47:51.557 --> 47:53.828
about the stuff you were seeing
like,

47:53.860 --> 47:55.557
while it was actually happening?

47:57.125 --> 48:00.068
I don't know Ad, I'm sorry,
okay?

48:01.507 --> 48:03.715
If I were to see something
like that,

48:03.749 --> 48:05.796
I'd have told you.

48:05.828 --> 48:10.596
I know, just didn't
wanna make a fuss, sort of.

48:10.627 --> 48:12.707
Shit, you sound like an old
woman.

48:14.371 --> 48:15.620
You know I don't.

48:15.651 --> 48:17.058
Yeah you do.

48:17.090 --> 48:19.331
Oh no dears, I don't know make a
fuss,

48:19.363 --> 48:21.187
It's only a broken ankle.

48:23.331 --> 48:24.291
Wait, did you just?

48:24.322 --> 48:25.187
You ready?

48:26.466 --> 48:27.939
No, no I'm not ready.

48:27.970 --> 48:29.922
Did you just pick that
fucking lock with a hairpin?

48:31.233 --> 48:32.321
What?

48:32.353 --> 48:37.153
I said, did you, just pick
that lock with a hairpin?

48:37.185 --> 48:38.017
No.

48:42.178 --> 48:43.008
But, yeah.

48:45.218 --> 48:46.017
Wicked.

48:47.424 --> 48:49.089
Did Steve show you how to do
that?

48:50.945 --> 48:52.161
Yeah, that must be it.

48:52.193 --> 48:53.280
Look, are you ready?

48:53.312 --> 48:56.224
Yeah, yeah, do you think
he'd show me how to do that?

49:00.385 --> 49:01.537
Run, go, go.

49:08.992 --> 49:10.144
Let go

49:10.176 --> 49:10.976
of my

49:12.864 --> 49:13.663
sister.

49:36.959 --> 49:37.758
What's it doing?

49:37.790 --> 49:38.621
Shh.

50:00.444 --> 50:01.821
Looks inviting.

50:21.308 --> 50:23.674
What are all of these for?

50:24.795 --> 50:28.699
Once you get used to the, you
know,

50:28.731 --> 50:30.907
paralyzing sense of terror.

50:37.113 --> 50:39.962
Maybe, they're motion
activated.

50:42.554 --> 50:44.154
I don't think so.

51:12.728 --> 51:14.264
Becca.

51:17.496 --> 51:18.327
Beca.

51:22.648 --> 51:23.575
Get open.

52:05.653 --> 52:06.741
Oh shit.

52:48.786 --> 52:51.985
The fuck you do that for?

52:52.018 --> 52:54.256
Why the fuck did you shut the
door?

52:58.161 --> 52:58.960
Johnson.

53:00.880 --> 53:02.321
This shit can barely open.

53:02.353 --> 53:03.985
Come on, it gotta get open.

53:04.017 --> 53:04.881
Johnson.

53:08.177 --> 53:10.032
Come on, get out.

53:10.065 --> 53:10.896
Come on.

53:14.513 --> 53:15.440
Sergeant.

53:25.424 --> 53:28.623
Easy now, we're not going
anywhere.

53:32.526 --> 53:33.679
I'm lowering my weapon.

53:40.367 --> 53:42.157
Can you understand me?

54:21.005 --> 54:22.860
Didn't even slow it down Sarge.

54:24.395 --> 54:25.260
It was strong.

54:27.756 --> 54:28.620
Jesus.

54:30.859 --> 54:32.972
Johnson, where the fuck is
your weapon?

54:34.251 --> 54:35.083
Shit.

54:38.251 --> 54:40.939
Do the work and we're gone, all
right?

54:44.171 --> 54:45.739
We're also running low on
munitions.

54:45.770 --> 54:47.979
If there was ever a good
time to fall back and...

54:48.010 --> 54:50.538
Bell should have at least
one clip still on her.

54:51.690 --> 54:53.514
Okay, Bell first.

54:55.209 --> 54:58.186
Our walkies are useless, but
there's an old radio room

54:58.218 --> 54:59.209
on the ground floor.

55:00.490 --> 55:02.378
That part of the facility still
has power,

55:02.409 --> 55:03.434
which means we might be able

55:03.465 --> 55:05.545
to punch a signal out from
there.

55:05.577 --> 55:06.377
Let's move.

55:12.744 --> 55:13.929
I'd rather go back down the
stairs,

55:13.960 --> 55:16.265
than to fall into that lot.

55:17.288 --> 55:20.969
I'm in, maybe we can
go round another way.

55:27.208 --> 55:29.480
I don't want to keep coming
back here.

55:29.512 --> 55:30.472
How are we going to find them,

55:30.504 --> 55:32.551
looking in places we've already
been?

55:32.584 --> 55:34.791
You know they aren't there
because we've already been there.

55:34.823 --> 55:36.358
Ad, I've already told you,

55:36.391 --> 55:38.023
we need to work out where
we are before this...

55:39.464 --> 55:40.583
Don't fucking move.

55:45.351 --> 55:46.950
I said, don't fucking move.

55:46.983 --> 55:49.574
Easy soldier, we're unarmed
civilians.

55:49.607 --> 55:51.591
Shut up.

55:51.622 --> 55:52.934
We're unarmed.

55:54.022 --> 55:54.823
No threat here.

55:54.854 --> 55:55.814
Shut up.

55:55.846 --> 55:57.766
Where the fuck is Bell?

55:59.750 --> 56:00.582
Okay,

56:02.854 --> 56:04.485
which one is it gonna be?

56:04.518 --> 56:05.318
What?

56:06.182 --> 56:07.685
Lower your weapon.

56:07.717 --> 56:08.518
Sarge.

56:09.637 --> 56:11.461
What you like the young lady
to do?

56:11.493 --> 56:13.861
Shut up, or tell you where Bell
is?

56:13.893 --> 56:14.757
At ease.

56:20.773 --> 56:22.405
What's your name?

56:22.436 --> 56:24.804
I'm Francis, this is Adam.

56:24.837 --> 56:25.636
Grace.

56:27.268 --> 56:28.932
I'm Grace, and this is Adam.

56:33.027 --> 56:34.947
I'm sergeant Davies.

56:34.980 --> 56:38.147
This is private Taylor,
and leftenant Johnson.

56:38.179 --> 56:42.691
Now Grace, there was a body in
that room.

56:42.723 --> 56:44.035
Do you know where it went?

56:45.539 --> 56:46.883
We saw a thing that...

56:50.402 --> 56:51.874
We saw something take the body.

56:51.907 --> 56:53.794
We didn't take the body.

56:53.827 --> 56:54.626
Why'd we do that?

56:54.658 --> 56:55.522
Jesus, Ad.

56:57.186 --> 56:58.306
What?

56:58.338 --> 56:59.843
He's just staring at us.

56:59.874 --> 57:00.961
At least I know one thing.

57:00.994 --> 57:02.626
He knows we didn't take the
body.

57:04.194 --> 57:08.289
Bell, they know we
didn't touch Bell's body.

57:12.993 --> 57:14.049
So it's just you two down
here?

57:14.081 --> 57:15.073
Yeah, no one else.

57:15.105 --> 57:16.673
No, there's three others,

57:16.705 --> 57:19.329
and we'd very much like to find
them.

57:19.360 --> 57:20.737
Very good.

57:20.768 --> 57:22.048
We move to the radar room.

57:22.080 --> 57:23.842
Sarge, what about Bell, sir?

57:27.520 --> 57:30.016
If we're gonna find her, we
will.

57:30.048 --> 57:33.088
But our next objective is the
radio room.

57:33.952 --> 57:37.281
Taylor, I want you at
the rear with Johnson.

57:37.312 --> 57:41.024
Adam, Grace, you stay behind me.

57:41.056 --> 57:42.527
Let's move.

58:24.540 --> 58:25.373
Maddie.

58:26.396 --> 58:27.198
Madd.

58:28.220 --> 58:29.821
You've got a knife?

58:29.852 --> 58:30.652
I'm tired of running around.

58:30.685 --> 58:33.821
I don't know who's chasing us.

58:33.853 --> 58:36.508
I understand but, we need to
go.

58:36.540 --> 58:38.939
The knife, it is something.

59:01.178 --> 59:02.011
Christ.

59:02.938 --> 59:04.922
Madd what are you doing?

59:11.291 --> 59:12.155
Nice.

59:22.553 --> 59:24.057
And that's foul.

59:28.634 --> 59:30.072
It has the white.

1:00:47.827 --> 1:00:48.916
Stay close.

1:00:59.443 --> 1:01:01.235
What does that mean?

1:01:05.555 --> 1:01:07.475
No sight of the stuff
in your book Sarge.

1:01:07.508 --> 1:01:08.339
Quiet.

1:01:55.983 --> 1:01:58.415
Hey, you all right?

1:02:00.718 --> 1:02:02.575
You don't hear that?

1:02:28.846 --> 1:02:29.677
Can you hear me?

1:02:29.710 --> 1:02:30.862
Shut up.

1:02:30.894 --> 1:02:32.814
'Cause I can fucking hear you.

1:02:32.846 --> 1:02:33.709
Good.

1:02:34.702 --> 1:02:36.973
I thought I totally lost my
shit.

1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:44.842
Which way?

1:03:44.873 --> 1:03:45.641
Which way did he go?

1:03:45.673 --> 1:03:46.825
Quiet.

1:03:46.857 --> 1:03:48.553
Give me the monitor.

1:04:29.830 --> 1:04:30.694
We move.

1:04:35.013 --> 1:04:36.261
Now.

1:04:36.294 --> 1:04:37.414
Where the fuck are we going?

1:04:37.446 --> 1:04:38.756
Shut up, Adam.

1:05:24.929 --> 1:05:26.179
Hey.

1:05:26.211 --> 1:05:27.938
Madds, do...

1:05:27.969 --> 1:05:29.729
Do I know this place?

1:05:32.577 --> 1:05:33.378
I've,

1:05:34.466 --> 1:05:36.258
Steve, we've...

1:05:36.290 --> 1:05:38.018
Been here before.

1:05:38.050 --> 1:05:39.489
I remember.

1:05:39.521 --> 1:05:42.465
Steven, I remember we were
supposed

1:05:43.522 --> 1:05:44.449
to be working then...

1:05:44.482 --> 1:05:45.345
Madline.

1:05:46.945 --> 1:05:48.449
What have we done?

1:05:54.305 --> 1:05:55.137
Already?

1:05:55.169 --> 1:05:57.313
But, but, Steven we haven't
finished.

1:05:57.345 --> 1:05:58.113
How can...

1:05:58.145 --> 1:06:01.697
It must be Ovin, we must go to
him.

1:06:01.728 --> 1:06:02.976
Run along, now.

1:06:04.672 --> 1:06:05.793
Oh God.

1:06:46.014 --> 1:06:47.230
Bloody hell.

1:06:50.142 --> 1:06:51.133
You tried.

1:06:56.893 --> 1:06:59.164
Back at the blackboard room,

1:06:59.197 --> 1:07:00.028
What did you see?

1:07:00.956 --> 1:07:02.269
Nothing.

1:07:02.300 --> 1:07:03.676
Did you see Mathews?

1:07:04.796 --> 1:07:07.389
A man, standing against the
wall?

1:07:09.948 --> 1:07:11.483
Red lights?

1:07:11.515 --> 1:07:13.852
Did you hear the evacuation
siren?

1:07:13.884 --> 1:07:18.266
No, no and no.

1:07:18.299 --> 1:07:20.891
But I watched, you looked
freaked out.

1:07:20.924 --> 1:07:22.299
Yeah, I saw all that.

1:07:24.635 --> 1:07:25.628
Seriously?

1:07:26.523 --> 1:07:27.323
Yeah, Seriously.

1:07:27.355 --> 1:07:28.475
And there was a song.

1:07:29.403 --> 1:07:30.459
Did you hear the song?

1:07:31.867 --> 1:07:33.114
I've heard it before somewhere,

1:07:33.147 --> 1:07:35.481
but I can't remember where.

1:07:35.514 --> 1:07:37.114
You said, you heard it in the
tunnel.

1:07:37.978 --> 1:07:39.898
Yeah, but it feels really
familiar now,

1:07:39.930 --> 1:07:42.650
and I remember it from before
the tunnel.

1:07:44.602 --> 1:07:45.882
Still open out.

1:07:46.873 --> 1:07:48.346
It must be closed.

1:07:51.322 --> 1:07:54.841
G, where you

1:08:20.407 --> 1:08:22.486
Can you tell me why your here?

1:08:25.719 --> 1:08:26.552
A test.

1:08:30.807 --> 1:08:33.910
I'm not exactly sure what for,
it's a...

1:08:38.134 --> 1:08:39.575
No.

1:08:39.606 --> 1:08:41.815
I'm sorry, I can't remember.

1:08:47.798 --> 1:08:49.142
That's perfectly normal.

1:08:52.982 --> 1:08:55.637
Fraid all of this, it's very
normal.

1:08:57.845 --> 1:09:01.301
Yes, it is.

1:09:01.333 --> 1:09:03.253
Just a few more questions, all
right?

1:09:05.461 --> 1:09:06.293
Yes sir.

1:09:17.940 --> 1:09:19.348
Where were you born?

1:09:20.500 --> 1:09:21.331
England.

1:09:23.923 --> 1:09:26.932
Where exactly in England?

1:09:26.964 --> 1:09:27.828
England.

1:09:31.859 --> 1:09:34.099
This is the test.

1:09:34.131 --> 1:09:34.931
Yes.

1:09:36.402 --> 1:09:38.579
I would very much like to
pass.

1:09:39.763 --> 1:09:41.042
You're doing very well.

1:09:42.258 --> 1:09:43.507
We're almost finished.

1:09:44.722 --> 1:09:45.586
Shall we?

1:09:47.282 --> 1:09:48.082
Yes.

1:09:56.434 --> 1:09:58.833
What is your name?

1:10:12.945 --> 1:10:14.577
You okay?

1:10:14.609 --> 1:10:17.776
You said a load of weird
shit, then fell down.

1:10:17.809 --> 1:10:20.112
I'm okay, you okay?

1:10:20.144 --> 1:10:21.808
Yeah, I'm okay.

1:10:21.840 --> 1:10:22.672
Okay.

1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:31.119
No, I'm fine, really.

1:10:32.783 --> 1:10:34.511
Humor us.

1:10:34.543 --> 1:10:37.999
You said it's going to close,

1:10:38.031 --> 1:10:39.086
remember that?

1:10:39.119 --> 1:10:40.622
Adam, I think there's
something very wrong with me.

1:10:40.653 --> 1:10:42.351
I have this weird feeling,

1:10:42.382 --> 1:10:43.886
that I've forgotten to do
something,

1:10:43.919 --> 1:10:45.422
that's so important
our lives depend on it.

1:10:45.453 --> 1:10:47.630
And at the same time, it's not
mine to do.

1:10:47.663 --> 1:10:49.038
It's someone else's problem.

1:10:49.070 --> 1:10:50.799
It's going to be all right.

1:10:50.830 --> 1:10:53.838
G, we just need to get you put
of here.

1:10:55.118 --> 1:10:56.654
Yeah?

1:10:56.686 --> 1:10:57.518
Right?

1:11:01.550 --> 1:11:02.605
I have distant memories

1:11:02.637 --> 1:11:04.461
of studying everything in this
book.

1:11:05.645 --> 1:11:07.437
From before this mission
started.

1:11:09.357 --> 1:11:10.573
But I know things about it now,

1:11:10.605 --> 1:11:11.917
that I didn't know before.

1:11:13.005 --> 1:11:14.251
I can understand sections of
this,

1:11:14.285 --> 1:11:16.236
like it's not written in fucking
Latin.

1:11:17.869 --> 1:11:20.364
I've got this weird feeling,

1:11:20.396 --> 1:11:22.828
I know there's an answer here.

1:11:22.859 --> 1:11:23.819
I have something.

1:11:24.716 --> 1:11:26.316
Fuck me.

1:11:26.348 --> 1:11:28.428
It keeps moving through the
bandwidth.

1:11:37.355 --> 1:11:38.155
That's it.

1:11:39.435 --> 1:11:40.363
Real comfy then.

1:11:41.355 --> 1:11:43.115
How about this though?

1:11:43.146 --> 1:11:44.714
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1:11:45.771 --> 1:11:47.371
He makes a solid argument.

1:11:47.402 --> 1:11:48.235
Seconded.

1:11:49.355 --> 1:11:52.810
Okay, but we're receiving
something.

1:11:52.843 --> 1:11:54.282
So it's possible to transmit.

1:11:55.754 --> 1:11:58.442
Request a pick up at the
tunnel entrance in two hours.

1:11:59.498 --> 1:12:01.385
This is Team Seven.

1:12:01.418 --> 1:12:03.209
We've suffered multiple losses.

1:12:03.242 --> 1:12:06.569
We request an extraction from
drop point, in two hours.

1:12:06.601 --> 1:12:08.137
At 20, 1800 hours.

1:12:09.193 --> 1:12:10.057
Repeat.

1:12:14.057 --> 1:12:17.577
This is team seven, we've
suffered multiple losses.

1:12:17.608 --> 1:12:20.937
Request extraction at
drop point in two hours.

1:12:20.969 --> 1:12:22.441
At 20, 1800 hours.

1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:28.200
So if your starting
to understand that book,

1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:33.575
is there anything in there
about what happened down here?

1:12:35.207 --> 1:12:36.775
I can't understand all of it,

1:12:37.608 --> 1:12:40.423
but from what I can tell,

1:12:40.455 --> 1:12:43.303
they were experimenting
with planetary alignments,

1:12:43.335 --> 1:12:46.471
and perpetual energy States,
and...

1:12:55.622 --> 1:12:57.734
And the demonic vision,

1:12:57.767 --> 1:12:59.783
that would swallow our world
whole,

1:12:59.814 --> 1:13:01.894
if not summoned properly.

1:13:04.422 --> 1:13:06.565
Something went very wrong.

1:13:15.013 --> 1:13:16.357
Sarge?

1:13:16.389 --> 1:13:17.476
It wasn't me.

1:13:25.572 --> 1:13:26.788
It wasn't me.

1:13:26.820 --> 1:13:27.652
Johnson.

1:13:33.028 --> 1:13:34.499
They keep showing.

1:13:35.652 --> 1:13:37.283
It wasn't me.

1:13:37.316 --> 1:13:38.947
We, no, no, no, no, no.

1:13:38.980 --> 1:13:40.196
Weren't there.

1:13:42.819 --> 1:13:46.307
They found patterns, in ancient
documents.

1:13:51.715 --> 1:13:53.540
And underneath it all,

1:13:54.947 --> 1:13:56.962
They found instructions.

1:14:08.194 --> 1:14:09.954
Just one remaining.

1:14:12.193 --> 1:14:13.569
Holy shit.

1:14:21.057 --> 1:14:23.008
What did we do?

1:14:23.041 --> 1:14:24.961
Davies, it's not you.

1:14:26.912 --> 1:14:30.240
What your seeing, it's not what
you did.

1:14:33.152 --> 1:14:35.200
Oh, brilliant.

1:14:35.231 --> 1:14:36.641
They had influence.

1:14:37.503 --> 1:14:40.000
They made us do things, then
forget.

1:14:41.951 --> 1:14:43.263
We said the words.

1:14:46.751 --> 1:14:47.871
And we fed it.

1:14:50.911 --> 1:14:54.111
It makes you forget, makes you
forget.

1:14:56.479 --> 1:14:58.111
It wasn't our fault.

1:14:59.007 --> 1:15:00.798
It was influencing us.

1:15:03.519 --> 1:15:04.511
Even before,

1:15:05.886 --> 1:15:06.878
even before.

1:15:13.437 --> 1:15:15.357
You can't close it now.

1:15:16.637 --> 1:15:17.886
Get up, soldier.

1:15:20.925 --> 1:15:22.718
We need to move, now.

1:15:31.005 --> 1:15:31.836
Through here.

1:15:37.053 --> 1:15:39.101
How you doing there, Sergeant
Davies?

1:15:39.133 --> 1:15:40.316
We weren't in control.

1:15:41.884 --> 1:15:43.643
We were being guided.

1:15:43.676 --> 1:15:47.420
Instead, we had to do these
things.

1:15:47.451 --> 1:15:48.668
Sergeant.

1:16:17.049 --> 1:16:18.491
Listen, he's gonna be okay.

1:16:18.521 --> 1:16:20.505
As long as we can get them out
of here.

1:16:21.465 --> 1:16:24.441
I know what he's going through,
sort of.

1:16:26.457 --> 1:16:28.569
He's being flooded with
memories,

1:16:28.601 --> 1:16:30.201
of things that happened here.

1:16:34.968 --> 1:16:35.800
Give me his gun.

1:16:45.752 --> 1:16:47.129
I recognize this.

1:16:49.847 --> 1:16:51.384
But at the same time, I don't.

1:16:52.953 --> 1:16:54.423
I know how to handle a weapon,

1:16:54.455 --> 1:16:56.407
but that isn't my memory.

1:16:58.744 --> 1:17:02.039
It's the same with this
place, and that soul,

1:17:02.070 --> 1:17:06.070
and I know I've got to close
something.

1:17:08.247 --> 1:17:10.390
We need to get you both out of
here.

1:17:15.638 --> 1:17:18.165
Further away from this
facility we can get him,

1:17:18.198 --> 1:17:19.381
the better off he'll be.

1:17:21.238 --> 1:17:23.221
He's not the only one.

1:18:05.362 --> 1:18:08.275
Steve?

1:18:14.643 --> 1:18:15.826
Steve.

1:18:27.922 --> 1:18:28.754
Grace.

1:18:39.281 --> 1:18:41.936
Grace, Grace.

1:19:31.022 --> 1:19:32.974
Where's Adam?

1:19:33.006 --> 1:19:34.862
I don't know, they take the
bodies.

1:19:36.813 --> 1:19:37.742
He's not a body.

1:19:38.925 --> 1:19:41.485
Grace, they took him.

1:19:42.573 --> 1:19:44.332
Where is my little brother?

1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:46.445
Help me, he's injured.

1:19:47.437 --> 1:19:50.091
We all need to get out, and
then we bring back help.

1:19:50.124 --> 1:19:51.245
You've got one job to do
Johnston,

1:19:51.277 --> 1:19:52.301
so listen carefully.

1:19:53.675 --> 1:19:56.972
Get Davies and that notebook,
safely out of this tunnel.

1:19:58.764 --> 1:19:59.789
You have four rounds left in
here,

1:19:59.820 --> 1:20:01.259
plus whatever you got in yours.

1:20:04.044 --> 1:20:05.067
Give me your knife.

1:20:07.147 --> 1:20:08.330
Give this to Adam.

1:20:09.611 --> 1:20:11.692
Grace, come with us.

1:20:11.723 --> 1:20:13.580
You can't help Adam now.

1:20:13.611 --> 1:20:15.851
First we get out, then we bring
back help.

1:20:17.259 --> 1:20:19.339
One job Johnson, don't fuck it
up.

1:20:20.586 --> 1:20:22.410
I'm going to find my brother.

1:20:25.162 --> 1:20:26.890
You heard the lady.

1:20:54.344 --> 1:20:56.168
Grace, Grace.

1:21:23.623 --> 1:21:26.311
Oh God, Maddie, Maddie.

1:21:26.342 --> 1:21:27.718
I'm sorry, Madd.

1:21:28.742 --> 1:21:29.925
I didn't mean to.

1:21:29.959 --> 1:21:30.919
I didn't.

1:21:30.950 --> 1:21:31.749
It's okay.

1:21:31.782 --> 1:21:33.222
I'm sorry Madd.

1:21:36.006 --> 1:21:37.766
It was an accident G.

1:21:42.917 --> 1:21:44.550
I know, it's okay.

1:21:47.238 --> 1:21:48.868
Just come over here.

1:21:53.349 --> 1:21:54.596
I killed her.

1:21:56.547 --> 1:21:57.380
I know.

1:21:58.821 --> 1:21:59.684
It's okay.

1:22:00.996 --> 1:22:03.044
Just come over here.

1:22:12.675 --> 1:22:15.236
Adam, get up and come here now.

1:22:17.156 --> 1:22:18.659
I'm not leaving her.

1:22:22.402 --> 1:22:23.618
No.

1:22:23.651 --> 1:22:28.129
No

1:22:29.345 --> 1:22:30.466
I am sorry.

1:22:31.426 --> 1:22:32.290
What?

1:22:33.506 --> 1:22:34.402
What are you?

1:22:34.435 --> 1:22:36.707
You have precious little time.

1:22:36.737 --> 1:22:38.179
Did you do this?

1:22:38.210 --> 1:22:39.362
Yes, and no.

1:22:40.450 --> 1:22:42.050
I am sorry.

1:22:42.082 --> 1:22:43.170
Please, wait.

1:22:44.961 --> 1:22:46.368
Do you feel that?

1:22:48.001 --> 1:22:49.698
That strength is me.

1:22:53.088 --> 1:22:53.921
This,

1:22:55.873 --> 1:22:56.673
is you.

1:22:58.847 --> 1:22:59.649
Adam.

1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:05.024
I can help you.

1:23:05.057 --> 1:23:06.687
But we must hurry.

1:23:19.039 --> 1:23:19.904
I want to make certain,

1:23:19.935 --> 1:23:20.990
you understand the gravity

1:23:21.022 --> 1:23:23.136
of what's happening here.

1:23:23.167 --> 1:23:23.999
The importance.

1:23:30.335 --> 1:23:31.807
You must

1:23:31.838 --> 1:23:34.014
The fail safe must fall.

1:23:35.263 --> 1:23:37.566
Only this, and close them.

1:23:40.253 --> 1:23:42.878
Unwilling

1:23:44.093 --> 1:23:45.182
Okay, okay.

1:23:46.782 --> 1:23:47.709
Enough.

1:23:47.742 --> 1:23:48.638
Enough?

1:23:48.669 --> 1:23:49.598
You stand facing a door,

1:23:49.629 --> 1:23:52.382
that's been closed for
millennia.

1:23:52.413 --> 1:23:56.572
A door that 60 years ago, men
were tricked into opening.

1:23:56.604 --> 1:23:59.420
It was an unwilling sacrifice,

1:23:59.452 --> 1:24:01.981
and that I've been
holding closed ever since.

1:24:03.132 --> 1:24:05.852
Now, only you can help me close
it.

1:24:05.885 --> 1:24:06.748
Why?

1:24:09.083 --> 1:24:11.516
What's on the other side?

1:24:11.548 --> 1:24:12.380
Door is this.

1:24:15.068 --> 1:24:17.148
It is coming, Grace.

1:24:19.356 --> 1:24:20.988
The devourer of worlds.

1:24:22.011 --> 1:24:23.196
Hunger, everlasting.

1:24:23.227 --> 1:24:25.755
That is not it's true shape.

1:24:25.788 --> 1:24:28.507
Even it cannot remember
that many eons ago.

1:24:29.979 --> 1:24:32.155
Destruction now is an amalgam,

1:24:32.187 --> 1:24:35.002
of all the life in this world.

1:24:35.035 --> 1:24:37.114
It infects and consumes
everything.

1:24:38.267 --> 1:24:41.210
Finally becoming just one life
form.

1:24:43.098 --> 1:24:45.754
Even ever since it reached here,

1:24:45.786 --> 1:24:47.898
it has been probing our world.

1:24:48.794 --> 1:24:49.593
What can we do?

1:24:50.457 --> 1:24:52.281
You know what we must do.

1:24:52.314 --> 1:24:53.241
No.

1:24:54.104 --> 1:24:55.321
It must be closed.

1:24:55.353 --> 1:24:56.665
No.

1:24:56.698 --> 1:24:57.944
We must fall.

1:24:57.976 --> 1:24:58.808
No.

1:25:02.425 --> 1:25:03.417
Thank you.

1:25:19.959 --> 1:25:20.887
Let's go.

1:25:51.029 --> 1:25:51.894
Sorry.

1:25:58.646 --> 1:26:00.405
It's got to close, G.

1:26:06.325 --> 1:26:07.477
You must fall.

1:26:26.355 --> 1:26:27.219
Johnson.

1:26:28.404 --> 1:26:29.843
Johnson, no.

1:26:29.876 --> 1:26:30.739
Johnson.
