00:05.806 --> 00:08.709
[***]

00:10.244 --> 00:13.214
[Dana]
Dino Dana!

00:13.247 --> 00:16.750
[theme music,
various dinosaurs roaring]

00:33.267 --> 00:37.438
[theme music continues,
various dinosaurs roaring]

00:40.274 --> 00:42.576
Dino Dana!

00:42.610 --> 00:45.546
[roar]

00:50.651 --> 00:52.620
[Dana]
Face Your Fearosaurus

00:55.656 --> 00:58.759
[gentle music and grunting]

01:05.833 --> 01:07.268
Brachiosaurus!

01:07.301 --> 01:08.736
You're so big,

01:08.769 --> 01:11.305
the view must be
great from up there!

01:11.339 --> 01:13.707
[kid]
You going to go or what?

01:13.741 --> 01:16.177
Well, we're waiting right here.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.878
I better go investigate.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.613
Bye, Brachiosaurus.

01:19.647 --> 01:24.218
[low growl]

01:29.157 --> 01:30.558
We're never going to
get to slide down.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.260
What's going on?

01:32.293 --> 01:33.661
This kid won't move.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.429
He's hogging the whole slide.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.237
Hey, I'm Dana.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.438
You okay?

01:45.739 --> 01:48.476
Are you stuck?

01:48.509 --> 01:50.211
Are you afraid
of being high up?

01:51.179 --> 01:52.913
This is taking forever.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.882
[sigh]
I've got an idea.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.450
Why don't you
yell some more

01:56.484 --> 01:58.486
and see if it goes
any faster?

02:01.922 --> 02:04.558
Think, Dana, think.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.463
[low growl]

02:09.497 --> 02:10.731
You know,

02:10.764 --> 02:13.534
you remind me of a dinosaur
I used to know.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.303
He was afraid
of heights too

02:15.336 --> 02:17.271
but I can't remember
his name.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.906
Hey, what's your name?

02:18.939 --> 02:20.208
[whispers]
Bradly.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.575
Bradly!

02:21.609 --> 02:23.244
That was the dinos name too.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.179
He was Bradly the Brachiosaurus.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.347
The only Brachiosaurus

02:26.380 --> 02:27.581
who was afraid of heights.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.683
Do you know what
a Brachiosaurus looks like?

02:31.852 --> 02:33.921
This is a Brachiosaurus.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.656
One of the most
humongous dinos

02:35.689 --> 02:37.525
to ever walk the earth.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.626
Want to hold him?

02:40.261 --> 02:41.662
You see...

02:43.331 --> 02:44.898
Brachiosaurus are herbivores

02:44.932 --> 02:46.734
whose necks are super tall.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.202
They are some of the biggest

02:48.236 --> 02:50.271
dinosaurs of them all,

02:50.304 --> 02:51.839
eating from
the tops of the trees

02:51.872 --> 02:53.574
is what they do best

02:53.607 --> 02:55.443
but there was one named Bradly

02:55.476 --> 02:58.479
who wasn't like the rest.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.414
No, that's not Bradly.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.849
No way, don't you know.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.217
If you're looking for him

03:03.251 --> 03:04.685
you have to go low.

03:06.887 --> 03:10.491
Now you know sometimes
the truth, it can hurt

03:10.524 --> 03:11.659
and the truth is Bradly

03:11.692 --> 03:14.262
liked to stay
close to the dirt.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.698
Hi, I'm Bradly.

03:17.731 --> 03:18.832
[Dana]
He never put his neck

03:18.866 --> 03:20.434
all the way up in the sky,

03:20.468 --> 03:21.735
too worried what would happen

03:21.769 --> 03:24.372
if he put it up super high.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.673
So, Bradly ate grass

03:25.706 --> 03:27.341
for breakfast, lunch and dinner

03:27.375 --> 03:29.009
but it definitely
didn't make him

03:29.042 --> 03:30.511
feel like a winner.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.680
The other Brachiosaurus
made fun of him

03:32.713 --> 03:34.315
for eating near the ground

03:34.348 --> 03:35.783
especially since tree tops

03:35.816 --> 03:38.652
are where all the tastiest
leaves are found.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.391
When they'd eaten
their fill of leaves,

03:43.424 --> 03:45.393
his herd left in a rush

03:45.426 --> 03:47.395
but Bradly didn't
see them leaving,

03:47.428 --> 03:49.229
not under all that mush.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.799
Hm.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.602
Hm? Guys?

03:54.635 --> 03:56.804
[Dana]
After Bradly's herd went off,

03:56.837 --> 03:58.606
quick, quick on the double,

03:58.639 --> 04:01.008
poor Bradly was left alone,

04:01.041 --> 04:03.811
helpless to predator trouble.

04:03.844 --> 04:07.281
Then, out of nowhere
he felt a huge rumble

04:07.315 --> 04:09.583
and it shook the ground so much

04:09.617 --> 04:12.720
it made poor Bradly stumble.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.355
Bradly knew that something

04:14.388 --> 04:15.789
was coming and fast

04:15.823 --> 04:17.658
but the trees were too thick.

04:17.691 --> 04:19.560
He couldn't see past.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.529
Something was coming alright.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.797
The noise filled him with dread

04:23.831 --> 04:25.699
but the only way
to find out what

04:25.733 --> 04:27.968
was for Bradly to
lift up his head.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.570
Oh no.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.476
Then what happened to Bradly?

04:35.509 --> 04:37.411
Look, he's going up,
finally.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.313
Guess what you just did?

04:39.347 --> 04:41.048
- You just took a step up.
- I did?

04:41.081 --> 04:42.716
Yeah.
Want to take another one?

04:42.750 --> 04:43.917
No.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.553
[chanting]
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

04:45.586 --> 04:49.657
Not helping, not helping,
not helping!

04:49.690 --> 04:52.393
Bradly did the same
thing you just did.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.798
He took it one step at a time

04:57.831 --> 05:01.535
and tried with all his might.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.036
And wouldn't you know it,

05:03.070 --> 05:05.973
he rose to a great new height.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.742
He still couldn't see

05:08.776 --> 05:10.644
what was coming
through the trees

05:10.678 --> 05:12.380
but he did feel the knocking

05:12.413 --> 05:14.047
in his very nervous knees.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.684
Something was close

05:16.717 --> 05:18.519
and his herd has no clue.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.421
He couldn't see what it was.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.456
He didn't know what to do.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.492
He hoped maybe it was friendly

05:24.525 --> 05:26.727
and just wanted to play.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.862
Roar!

05:28.896 --> 05:30.931
Then he heard the roar
of a predator

05:30.964 --> 05:33.434
and knew it wasn't his day.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.603
Was it scary?

05:35.636 --> 05:37.438
Just curious

05:37.471 --> 05:39.473
'cause we're all
stuck here waiting.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.874
Oh, it was scary.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.043
But guess what's
not scary, Bradly?

05:43.076 --> 05:44.645
You just took another step.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.746
I did?

05:45.779 --> 05:46.914
Yeah, good job,
buddy.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.616
Who wants to finish
the story now?

05:50.551 --> 05:51.919
You did it while
you were distracted?

05:51.952 --> 05:53.954
Hey, do you think
a distraction

05:53.987 --> 05:55.623
will help get Bradly
the Brachiosaurus

05:55.656 --> 05:56.624
higher up?

05:56.657 --> 05:57.791
Maybe!

05:57.825 --> 05:59.460
Let's see
what happens next.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.561
[kid]
Excuse me.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.095
Uh, can you talk a bit louder?

06:02.129 --> 06:03.464
We can't hear you down here.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.799
Let's see
what happens next!

06:07.701 --> 06:09.470
Something was coming fast

06:09.503 --> 06:10.904
and Bradly was scared.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.072
He needed to see it

06:12.105 --> 06:14.174
but wasn't sure if he dared.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.776
Then Bradly heard a sound

06:15.809 --> 06:18.145
that sounded like a squawk.

06:18.178 --> 06:21.849
He looked up and
received quite a shock.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.917
Coming towards him
and it was a sight,

06:23.951 --> 06:25.185
a Quetzalcoatlus

06:25.218 --> 06:27.688
was coming close
there in midflight.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.122
Bradly had no choice.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.158
He had to make a quick decision

06:31.191 --> 06:34.728
so he dodged his head
to avoid a collision.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.864
Bradly was so distracted

06:36.897 --> 06:39.900
he didn't even know
that as he was dodging

06:39.933 --> 06:42.503
up high did he go.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.771
And then from up high,

06:43.804 --> 06:45.639
his vision no longer deterred,

06:45.673 --> 06:47.908
he saw the Giganotosaurus pack

06:47.941 --> 06:49.677
approaching his herd.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.980
[tense music]

06:53.013 --> 06:54.815
Aah!

06:54.848 --> 06:58.619
[tense music]

06:58.652 --> 06:59.987
[Dana]
Bradly knew he had to warn

07:00.020 --> 07:01.889
all his Brachiosaurus friends

07:01.922 --> 07:03.223
but that meant going higher

07:03.256 --> 07:05.158
or soon met their ends.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.863
Does Bradly do it?

07:09.897 --> 07:11.164
Yeah, does he?

07:11.198 --> 07:12.866
I don't know
but you just did.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.034
I did?

07:14.067 --> 07:16.036
I did it!
I'm at the top!

07:16.069 --> 07:17.037
Good job, Bradly.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.506
Ready to slide down?

07:18.539 --> 07:19.740
No.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.210
Well, maybe end of
the story will help him?

07:23.243 --> 07:25.613
[chanting]
Story, story, story.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.681
Okay, okay!

07:27.715 --> 07:31.084
Bradly had no choice
but to face his fear.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.254
He had to let his herd know

07:34.287 --> 07:35.856
that danger was near

07:35.889 --> 07:37.791
so Bradly stood his ground

07:37.825 --> 07:39.493
and faced his fear.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.096
For the first time ever

07:43.130 --> 07:45.533
he became a brave fellow.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.568
He took a big, deep breath

07:47.601 --> 07:50.671
and let out a mighty bellow!

07:50.704 --> 07:52.606
And the other Brachiosaurus

07:52.640 --> 07:54.207
got a total surprise.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.943
Bradly was keeping his head up

07:55.976 --> 07:57.811
in front of their eyes

07:57.845 --> 07:59.179
but that wasn't all.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.582
He was also letting them know-

08:01.615 --> 08:03.651
The Giganotosaurus are coming.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.286
Go, go, go!

08:06.319 --> 08:08.121
[Dana]
Bradly's Brachiosaurus pals

08:08.155 --> 08:09.990
scattered as quick as they could

08:10.023 --> 08:12.192
and they left poor Bradly alone,

08:12.225 --> 08:14.261
exactly where he last stood.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.268
The Giganotosaurus
were almost on Bradly.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.936
He was a nervous wreck.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.039
Then, he got his
brightest idea yet.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.809
He could use his neck.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.210
Even though Bradly was shaking

08:30.243 --> 08:31.745
and filled with dread,

08:31.779 --> 08:35.048
as quick as he could
he lowered his head.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.817
Tripping the lead predator

08:36.850 --> 08:38.719
and making him fall,

08:38.752 --> 08:40.153
one predator down

08:40.187 --> 08:43.190
wasn't the end of them all.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.125
None of the other Giganotosaurus

08:45.158 --> 08:46.794
were flat on their back.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.996
In fact, they were
getting excited

08:49.029 --> 08:51.031
for their afternoon snack.

08:51.064 --> 08:55.302
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.305
[Dana]
They got closer to Bradly,

08:58.338 --> 09:00.007
all hungry and ready to eat.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.675
They could almost smell

09:01.709 --> 09:05.278
the tasty Brachiosaurs meat.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.914
But that's not the end.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.049
There's still more to this show.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.585
At the last minute
Bradly was saved,

09:11.619 --> 09:12.820
don't ya know.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.825
Bradly's herd joined in

09:17.858 --> 09:19.192
and followed his lead.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.028
They stopped so Giganotosaurus,

09:21.061 --> 09:22.696
oh yes indeed.

09:22.730 --> 09:25.198
They called Bradly the
Brachiosaurus a hero,

09:25.232 --> 09:27.000
a real number one pick.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.602
He raised his head,

09:28.636 --> 09:30.003
protected his herd

09:30.037 --> 09:31.872
and even taught
them a new trick.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.342
Go Bradly!

09:35.375 --> 09:36.977
You ready to be
brave like Bradly was

09:37.010 --> 09:38.111
when he put his head down?

09:38.145 --> 09:39.112
Ready!

09:39.146 --> 09:40.881
Then see you
at the bottom.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.989
You can do it.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.993
- You did it!
- Thanks, Dana.

09:54.662 --> 09:55.696
You know what?

09:55.729 --> 09:56.930
You keep it.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.331
Then you'll always remember

09:58.365 --> 10:00.801
how you were brave
like a Brachiosaurus.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.807
Hey, wait.
Before you go.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.842
Do you have any dino
stories about someone

10:08.876 --> 10:11.044
who's afraid of swinging
too high on the swing?

10:11.078 --> 10:12.880
Not for me,
for my friend.

10:12.913 --> 10:13.881
Of course.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.415
Have you ever heard of
Kent the Kentrosaurus

10:15.448 --> 10:17.751
who was scared to
swing his tail?

10:17.785 --> 10:19.286
[majestic music,
dino roars]

10:22.155 --> 10:24.892
[Dana]
Next up - more Dino Dana!

10:26.426 --> 10:29.329
[***]

10:30.864 --> 10:33.834
[Dana]
Dino Dana!

10:33.867 --> 10:38.839
[theme music,
various dinosaurs roaring]

10:38.872 --> 10:43.844
[theme music,
various dinosaurs roaring]

10:43.877 --> 10:48.849
[theme music,
various dinosaurs roaring]

10:48.882 --> 10:53.854
[theme music,
various dinosaurs roaring]

10:53.887 --> 10:58.826
[theme music,
various dinosaurs roaring]

11:00.894 --> 11:03.196
Dino Dana!

11:03.230 --> 11:06.133
[roar]

11:12.072 --> 11:15.242
[Dana]
Herd It Loud And Clear

11:16.409 --> 11:20.981
[Dana making loud 'moo' noises]

11:21.014 --> 11:29.189
[noises continue throughout]

11:29.222 --> 11:31.424
[groan]

11:33.160 --> 11:35.295
Moo!

11:36.429 --> 11:37.798
Mooo!

11:39.232 --> 11:41.034
[Dana] Moo!

11:41.068 --> 11:42.803
Mooo!

11:44.104 --> 11:46.106
Ugh.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.778
Moo!

11:52.145 --> 11:53.213
Moo!

11:53.246 --> 11:55.348
Dana...

11:55.382 --> 11:56.483
Moo!

11:56.516 --> 11:57.885
Dana!

11:57.918 --> 12:00.153
Moo!

12:00.187 --> 12:01.421
[shouts]
Dana!

12:01.454 --> 12:03.490
- Hi, Cai.
- Hi.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.526
What are you doing up
this early?

12:06.559 --> 12:09.162
I'm in the middle of
dino experiment 521.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.998
How did the Edmontosaurus
defend themselves?

12:11.031 --> 12:12.232
The Ed-monto what?

12:12.265 --> 12:13.233
This one.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.534
Right.
Sounds great but-

12:14.567 --> 12:15.435
It is.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.171
To solve it, what
do you think I need?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.307
Dana, I actually
just finished

12:20.340 --> 12:22.776
a really big test
for university.

12:22.810 --> 12:23.977
Dinosaurs!

12:24.011 --> 12:25.445
Right, okay.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.347
What do I have here?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.249
A very loud horn.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.350
Exactly.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.551
To make sure my moo sounds

12:31.584 --> 12:35.222
are loud enough to attract...

12:36.957 --> 12:38.425
[whispers]
It's the thing I said before.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.093
Oh. Dinosaurs.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.461
Yes, you win.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.930
Yay.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.097
Okay then.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.365
Have fun.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.902
Now, what do you
not see on me?

12:48.936 --> 12:52.539
Uh, Dana I'm actually having
a little trouble focusing.

12:52.572 --> 12:55.542
I think I'm only wearing
one contact lens.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.011
Oh, let me help you.
What?

12:58.045 --> 13:00.180
Hang on.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.414
Take this.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.415
Wait.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.551
- And this.
- Oh.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.553
[shouts]
I'm coming in the window!

13:06.586 --> 13:08.155
Dana, I don't know if
that's such a good idea.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.523
I think it's a great idea!

13:10.557 --> 13:12.059
Oh, I guess
you're coming in.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.226
Here you go.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.528
Alright.
Careful.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.066
Alright, you're in.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.001
Look closely.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.003
See any horns?

13:23.036 --> 13:24.204
Uh...

13:24.237 --> 13:25.438
Nope.
None.

13:26.940 --> 13:27.975
Spikes?

13:29.042 --> 13:30.077
Maybe.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.179
Ehn!
Trick question.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.280
None.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.983
Hard shell?

13:36.016 --> 13:38.385
[whispers]
It's the same answer as before.

13:38.418 --> 13:39.319
None.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.289
Exactly, because unlike
most other dinos,

13:42.322 --> 13:43.590
the Edmontosaurus didn't have

13:43.623 --> 13:45.926
any defenses on their bodies.

13:45.959 --> 13:48.061
Thanks for
that dino lesson.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.263
I should really
get back to sleep.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.099
Oh, did you know
the Edmontosaurus

13:52.132 --> 13:54.101
is an herbivore that
walked on all fours

13:54.134 --> 13:56.136
and had lots of
teeth, 1000 of them.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.370
Oh, and they're known as

13:57.404 --> 13:58.605
the cows of the dinosaur world

13:58.638 --> 13:59.907
because there were
so many of them!

13:59.940 --> 14:02.409
That is so much
information!

14:02.442 --> 14:04.111
And did you know they
used to travel in herds,

14:04.144 --> 14:05.178
just like--

14:05.212 --> 14:06.446
[shouts]
Moo!

14:06.479 --> 14:08.015
Cows.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.517
Cows, okay.

14:10.550 --> 14:14.321
Well, have fun
playing outside.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.224
I wouldn't call dino
research playing

14:17.257 --> 14:19.226
but have a good sleep.

14:19.259 --> 14:22.662
I'll just climb
my own way out.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.132
Great, great.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.106
[sigh]

14:34.241 --> 14:36.543
Moo!

14:38.011 --> 14:42.082
Moo!

14:44.084 --> 14:45.418
[loud bleating]

14:45.452 --> 14:47.587
I did it!

14:47.620 --> 14:51.258
I attracted a whole
family of Edmontosaurus.

14:51.291 --> 14:54.227
[triumphant music]

14:56.529 --> 14:58.231
This is amazing.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.001
[quiet dino chirp]

15:01.034 --> 15:03.503
Now I'll get to do
dino experiment 521,

15:03.536 --> 15:06.073
how did the Edmontosaurus
defend themselves?

15:06.106 --> 15:07.975
Oh, hi baby.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.448
Oh! [chuckles]
Aw...

15:15.482 --> 15:17.550
You baby, are so cute.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.387
You don't understand me, do you?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.255
Hold on.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.225
Moo!

15:25.258 --> 15:27.027
[loud crack]

15:27.060 --> 15:29.029
[crunching]

15:33.100 --> 15:35.235
Why'd you do that?

15:36.703 --> 15:39.206
Is that one of your defenses?

15:42.309 --> 15:43.310
Cai!

15:44.744 --> 15:45.979
Cai!

15:49.216 --> 15:51.151
Cai!

15:51.184 --> 15:52.619
[thumping]

15:52.652 --> 15:54.321
Cai!

15:56.656 --> 15:57.524
Cai!

15:57.557 --> 15:59.359
You won't believe
what just happened.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.162
You attracted the Edmonta--

16:02.195 --> 16:03.296
Saurus!

16:03.330 --> 16:06.066
And yes, a whole herd of them.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.168
I'm happy for you Dana.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.669
And look.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.571
They chewed up my horn.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.340
Ow.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.541
Oh.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.579
Dana, maybe they were
trying to be quiet

16:19.612 --> 16:22.182
so that they don't
wake anyone up.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.517
You mean like wake
up a predator?

16:24.551 --> 16:26.253
Sure.

16:26.286 --> 16:28.621
Is your theory that that's
one of their defenses?

16:30.123 --> 16:31.224
Uh huh.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.692
You're so smart!

16:32.725 --> 16:34.761
And you look really tired

16:34.794 --> 16:36.396
so why don't you
go back to sleep

16:36.429 --> 16:37.697
and I'll test out your theory.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.633
Thank you?

16:40.667 --> 16:42.402
[Dana]
No, thank you, Cai

16:42.435 --> 16:44.704
for helping me
with my dino experiment.

16:50.277 --> 16:53.280
[gentle mooing]

16:53.313 --> 16:56.549
Hey, if I don't get to moo,
why do you get to moo?

16:59.752 --> 17:02.389
[rumbling]

17:02.422 --> 17:04.491
Giganotosaurus.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.759
One of the biggest
carnivores ever.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.662
[roar]

17:09.696 --> 17:12.599
What defense do I have
against that predator?

17:12.632 --> 17:14.401
I hope it's not just mooing.

17:14.434 --> 17:18.405
[gentle mooing]

17:18.438 --> 17:21.408
Wait... are you making
noise to warn each other

17:21.441 --> 17:23.310
that there's a carnivore around?

17:23.343 --> 17:24.177
[gentle mooing]

17:24.211 --> 17:26.579
[whisper]
And now we're being quiet

17:26.613 --> 17:30.450
so that he doesn't hear you.

17:30.483 --> 17:42.295
[rumbling]

17:42.329 --> 17:45.798
[tense music]

17:45.832 --> 17:49.769
[quiet roar]

17:52.872 --> 17:54.474
That was close.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.809
Nice defense, Edmontosaurus.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.746
Cai's never going to
believe what just happened.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.815
[snoring]

18:02.849 --> 18:04.417
Cai, Cai, Cai, Cai!

18:04.451 --> 18:06.219
- Guess what?
- What? What?

18:06.253 --> 18:08.188
I finished my dino experiment.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.423
Oh, that, that's great, Dana.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.758
And you were right.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.193
I was?

18:13.226 --> 18:14.627
The Edmontosaurus
wanted me to be quiet

18:14.661 --> 18:15.895
because there was
a predator around,

18:15.928 --> 18:16.896
a Giganotosaurus

18:16.929 --> 18:19.666
but don't worry, they
all warned each other

18:19.699 --> 18:21.701
and we went super quiet

18:21.734 --> 18:22.769
and squished down to hide

18:22.802 --> 18:23.903
so it wouldn't find us.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.505
Oh, that is a relief.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.140
I know!

18:27.174 --> 18:31.611
But what if the
Giganotosaurus saw them?

18:31.644 --> 18:33.480
Then what would
their defenses be?

18:33.513 --> 18:35.648
Great question.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.850
Dino experiment 521 reopened,

18:37.884 --> 18:39.652
how would the Edmontosaurus
defend themselves

18:39.686 --> 18:41.454
if a Giganotosaurus
saw them?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.156
Don't fall back asleep,

18:43.190 --> 18:44.657
I'll be right back
with an update.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.893
You don't have...

18:48.595 --> 18:50.463
[groan]

18:50.497 --> 18:52.532
Guess what, Edmontosaurus!

18:52.565 --> 18:54.567
Dino experiment 521 is reopened.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.369
[rumbling]

18:56.403 --> 18:58.171
Giganotosaurus is back.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.508
[loud roar]

19:01.541 --> 19:03.576
Oh no.
It sees us.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.346
What's your defense when
a predator finds you?

19:06.379 --> 19:10.517
[loud mooing]

19:10.550 --> 19:12.952
Are you trying to scare it?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.821
Moo!

19:14.854 --> 19:16.423
Moo!!

19:17.624 --> 19:20.360
[loud roar]

19:21.661 --> 19:22.929
Now what?

19:24.964 --> 19:27.534
They're getting up on
their back two legs?

19:27.567 --> 19:30.237
What's that going to do?

19:30.270 --> 19:31.871
They're running
away on two legs.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.276
Did you know they could do that?

19:36.309 --> 19:37.944
Guess not.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.979
Bye, Edmontosaurus.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.749
I mean, moo.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.684
Bye moo.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.220
- Dana?
- Cai, you're up.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.356
I just needed some fresh air.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.391
You won't believe
what just happened.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.526
The Giganotosaurus
found the Edmontosaurus

19:53.560 --> 19:56.229
but don't worry,
they had another defense.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.531
They got up on two
legs and ran away.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.966
Isn't that crazy?

19:59.999 --> 20:01.734
I didn't even know
they could do that.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.671
I guess they're faster on two
legs than they are on four.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.740
And now, dino experiment
521 is solved.

20:07.774 --> 20:11.778
You know, those Edmontosaurus
sound kind of cool.

20:11.811 --> 20:12.945
They are.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.581
And now you can go back to
sleep because they're gone.

20:14.614 --> 20:17.016
Well, I'm already up so...

20:17.049 --> 20:19.919
So you want to do another
dino experiment with me?

20:19.952 --> 20:20.920
Great idea.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.389
I have so much we can do.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.991
Do you like herbivores,
carnivores or omnivores?

20:25.024 --> 20:26.659
Actually, back up.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.828
Do you want to do one on
dinosaurs, pterosaurs,

20:28.861 --> 20:30.430
pre-historic marine reptiles

20:30.463 --> 20:32.399
or prehistoric mammals?

20:32.432 --> 20:33.766
[Cai]
Pre-historic mammals.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.368
[Dana] What pre-historic mammal
do you want to be?

20:35.402 --> 20:39.872
[Cai]
Hmm, some type of hippopotamus.

20:39.906 --> 20:40.907
[roars]

20:40.940 --> 20:43.876
