WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:06.840 --> 00:10.677
We're back and things are about to
get fucking naughty.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.913
It's going to be bigger
than ever before.

00:15.248 --> 00:16.483
Getting fucked up.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.319
Arguing.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.621
Because you're not a princess!

00:21.688 --> 00:23.323
Tears.

00:24.124 --> 00:25.959
Bring it on.

00:26.025 --> 00:27.761
Vicky's packing, what the fuck?

00:27.827 --> 00:30.663
I need a bit of time to myself.
See yous.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.333
I reckon a few days off
to get bucked off her fella,

00:33.400 --> 00:35.902
she'll come back with
a big smile on her face.

00:35.969 --> 00:40.039
Marnie thinks she's ending things.
No, I'm ending things with you.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.411
He told me he didn't wanna pull.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.814
Do not fucking take me for a mug.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.417
I wanted you to go
and pull other people.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.419
Where has this came from?
Oh, my God.

00:52.485 --> 00:53.920
Why have I even said that?

00:53.987 --> 00:56.756
Do you not think
that's disrespectful?

00:56.823 --> 00:59.225
We're through
and I feel fucking free.

00:59.292 --> 01:01.428
Boyfriend Club is out the window.

01:03.163 --> 01:07.500
I should have a degree in pulling.
I'm a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.303
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:10.370 --> 01:12.238
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:12.305 --> 01:14.541
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.743
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

01:16.810 --> 01:20.413
I'm colourful and full of mischief.
Fake, flirty and I've got FFs.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.816
I'm going to make sparks fly.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.185
(all) Merry Christmas! Why-aye!

01:34.727 --> 01:36.963
Do you know what I've just realised?
What?

01:37.030 --> 01:39.466
There's literally no Boyfriend Club.

01:39.532 --> 01:43.369
Last night was a fucking disaster.
I told Gary to go off and pull

01:43.436 --> 01:47.307
and Holly got so pissed off at Kyle
because he kissed a girl goodbye.

01:47.373 --> 01:49.442
He kissed someone
in front of my face.

01:49.509 --> 01:52.879
Kyle completely betrayed my trust.
I feel like a complete mug.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.347
But it wasn't a snog.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.288
That's not a friendly kiss!

02:02.355 --> 02:05.225
That's like a "I want you"
kind of kiss.

02:05.291 --> 02:09.027
That's like a pulling her back.
I've lost all respect for him.

02:09.095 --> 02:11.264
He's done everything
I knew he would do.

02:16.169 --> 02:18.438
Is everyone awake?
Yeah.

02:22.108 --> 02:25.778
Holly has totally overreacted.
All I did was kiss my mate goodbye.

02:25.845 --> 02:29.215
She's so paranoid. I don't know what
I can do to make her trust us.

02:29.282 --> 02:31.784
I did kiss her,
but it wasn't a proper kiss.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.988
Then I had Charlotte and Marnie
trying to use this argument

02:35.054 --> 02:36.890
to vent their own feelings.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.225
Charlotte went off it with me
last night

02:39.292 --> 02:42.095
and the reason was she was
secretly angry at Gary

02:42.161 --> 02:45.231
and she needed someone to vent on
without looking jealous.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.903
I don't know where
me and Char are at.

02:49.969 --> 02:52.939
One minute she's all over us,
then telling us to pull.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.574
That girl's head is fucked.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.218
Boyfriend Club. Over.

03:05.285 --> 03:08.121
The Boyfriend Club has been
flushed down the toilet

03:08.187 --> 03:11.124
along with one of me fucking ponies.
What a relief.

03:12.425 --> 03:16.229
It's James's birthday and he's still
in bed. That only means one thing.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.131
Operation birthday alarm clock.

03:19.933 --> 03:23.069
The best thing he can expect
to wake up to on his birthday

03:23.136 --> 03:26.873
is a protein shake with a couple of
shots of vodka in as well.

03:29.642 --> 03:32.545
# Happy birthday! #

03:32.612 --> 03:35.648
I wake up and it's
my fucking birthday. Come on!

03:35.715 --> 03:38.518
We got you some muffins, cake
and a protein shake.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.454
A protein shake. How did they know?

03:41.521 --> 03:42.722
Drink your protein.

03:42.789 --> 03:46.092
James is gonna pure love this.
Neck up, you mug.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.427
Birthday, innit.

03:47.493 --> 03:51.164
You like protein, you like vodka.
(laughter)

03:51.230 --> 03:54.901
It's fucking canny decent, that.
Try it, it's nice, that.

03:54.968 --> 03:58.605
Have a muffin as well!
(laughter)

04:02.875 --> 04:05.411
(Gaz) What you looking at?

04:06.946 --> 04:09.482
I come down the stairs
and Kyle's sat on the sofa

04:09.549 --> 04:12.585
and he's looking sheepish.
This is gonna be awkward.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.357
(Scott) Silence.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.660
Fuck, this is awkward. All Kyle did
is kiss his mate goodbye.

04:20.726 --> 04:23.963
He needs to sort this out, ASAP.

04:26.599 --> 04:30.203
I need to speak to Holly. I don't
want last night to ruin what we have.

04:30.269 --> 04:31.471
I do really like her.

04:35.274 --> 04:37.143
I'm glad Kyle wants to speak to me,

04:37.210 --> 04:40.213
but anything less than an apology
and he can fuck off.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.218
When you brought that girl in
it was kind of like...

04:45.284 --> 04:47.620
I know she was a friend
and that's fine,

04:47.687 --> 04:50.223
but then
when I saw you kissing her...

04:50.289 --> 04:53.359
I didn't kiss her properly, though.
It was a friend kiss.

04:53.426 --> 04:54.894
Like with one of your mates.

04:54.961 --> 04:58.297
Kyle is insisting this was a peck,
but I seen it with my own eyes.

04:58.364 --> 05:02.001
This is the whole reason
I didn't wanna have sex with you.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.536
I knew you would do this.

05:03.603 --> 05:08.708
I've come this far with Holly and
it's being ruined by a stupid kiss.

05:08.775 --> 05:10.743
So what happens now, then?

05:13.112 --> 05:16.082
I obviously like you, you know that.
Do you?

05:16.149 --> 05:18.651
I do like you, man. I do like you.

05:20.553 --> 05:23.456
Aw, that's cute.
(both chuckle)

05:23.523 --> 05:25.525
I'm gonna give Kyle another chance.

05:25.591 --> 05:28.227
This may have been
a massive misunderstanding

05:28.294 --> 05:31.664
but if he fucks me over again,
I'll chop his fucking balls off.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.171
It's the party for James's birthday

05:38.237 --> 05:40.440
so we're trying
to come up with a theme.

05:40.506 --> 05:42.975
American footballers.
Icons.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.545
Old-fashioned,
like monocles and that.

05:45.611 --> 05:48.147
What about Christmas?
Oh, my God.

05:51.584 --> 05:55.455
I love Christmas and a Christmas
themed party will be mint.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.124
We've never all spent Christmas
together

05:58.191 --> 06:01.094
and the next day we could have
a big Christmas dinner

06:01.160 --> 06:03.629
and do Secret Santa
and pass out presents.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.765
(James) That'll be class.

06:05.832 --> 06:08.000
Char's came up with the best idea.

06:08.067 --> 06:10.837
The day after the party
is gonna be Christmas Day,

06:10.903 --> 06:14.006
so we'll have a family meal,
give each other presents

06:14.073 --> 06:15.842
and I might even stuff a turkey.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.479
Oh, my God!
Can you get them?

06:19.545 --> 06:21.080
It'll look unreal.

06:21.147 --> 06:25.118
# Santa's got a bit fat cock
He can climb right in my box

06:25.184 --> 06:29.856
# I'm always on the naughty list
He can spank me, he's a fat prick #

06:32.992 --> 06:36.162
Have you spoken to Gary yet?
I feel I should want him to pull.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.697
Why?
Because.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.732
Why?
Because!

06:39.799 --> 06:42.135
Why?
I don't know the reason.

06:42.201 --> 06:43.369
I don't think you do.

06:43.436 --> 06:46.606
I want him to do it, then say
I wasn't really that bothered.

06:46.672 --> 06:48.775
What if you are?
I don't think I will.

06:48.841 --> 06:51.043
I feel like Charlotte's confused.

06:51.110 --> 06:55.014
She wants to test the water to prove
she's not 100% committed to Gary,

06:55.081 --> 06:57.450
but if Gary did it
she'd get upset about it

06:57.517 --> 06:59.986
and I don't know
what the hell's going on.

07:01.487 --> 07:03.523
You're an idiot.
Holly, it's simple.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.658
I don't want to get hurt
by Gary again.

07:05.725 --> 07:09.962
I need to cool things off
before I get in too deep.

07:13.399 --> 07:16.169
Christmas party tonight
and Christmas tomorrow.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.805
We need to get this house
looking like Christmas

07:18.871 --> 07:21.774
so we're off to buy decorations
and a Christmas tree.

07:28.214 --> 07:32.318
I love Christmas and everyone knows
Santa's late to the next house

07:32.385 --> 07:36.055
cos he's too busy licking me out
and dusting us up the arsehole.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.623
(Aaron) Put the fairy on top.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.862
We haven't got a fairy
to put on top

07:42.929 --> 07:46.299
so we'll use the rubber fanny
Kyle got nae action with.

07:46.365 --> 07:50.369
(James) Fairy on top!
Probably got someone's cum in it.

07:50.436 --> 07:54.574
That fairy goes perfectly on our
tree. Nothing suits our tree more.

07:56.809 --> 08:00.246
This is gonna be
the sickest Christmas party ever.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.482
This place is gonna look like
a winter wonderland.

08:03.549 --> 08:07.286
Santa, fucking ice sculptures,
it looks fucking class.

08:08.321 --> 08:12.058
I can't believe it. Someone's got us
an ice sculpture of me cock.

08:12.124 --> 08:14.493
Mine's a bit bigger,
but it is canny cold.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.769
We've got wor outfits ready
for the party tonight.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.739
Gaz is a reindeer,
Aaron's a snowman, Kyle's an elf

08:26.806 --> 08:28.774
and I'm Santa Claus, of course.

08:28.841 --> 08:32.078
I'm absolutely buzzing.
I'm a sexy elf!

08:32.144 --> 08:33.846
And Charlotte... is a pudding.

08:33.913 --> 08:36.782
(laughter)

08:36.849 --> 08:38.049
I think it looks good.

08:38.116 --> 08:42.455
I'm just gonna wrap my cock up in
tinsel and give it to some bird.

08:46.626 --> 08:51.063
We're getting ready for the party.
My outfit looks mint, I look mint,

08:51.130 --> 08:52.365
this is gonna be mint.

09:01.874 --> 09:05.678
We're all downstairs in wor costumes
having a few pre-drinks.

09:05.745 --> 09:08.948
Shame Vicky's not here,
but we're gonna have a mint night.

09:09.015 --> 09:12.652
Good how it's got a bell, then Holly
will always know where you are.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.387
Like, "Kyle! Where are you?!"

09:14.453 --> 09:16.689
I'm happy Kyle's got
a bell on his outfit,

09:16.756 --> 09:19.158
cos it means I'll know
where he is at all times

09:19.225 --> 09:21.527
and maybe I'll get
to ring his bell... end.

09:24.463 --> 09:27.533
Char's asking to talk
and it probably is a good thing.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.704
I wanna get everything off my chest
and get sorted before the party.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.480
Yeah, it is.
I can do better than that.

09:41.547 --> 09:44.617
It's old days, but...
It is always gonna be like that.

09:44.684 --> 09:47.887
She says we always argue.
I think she's making an excuse

09:47.954 --> 09:50.623
cos she's scared
of where this is going.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.929
It weren't getting too strong.
I said, there would...

09:56.996 --> 10:00.466
My and Gary's feelings will get
too strong if we carried this on

10:00.533 --> 10:03.703
and I don't want that,
not after a serious relationship.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.172
I just wanna be free
and single and have fun.

10:10.042 --> 10:13.579
Maybe me and Charlotte should talk
about our feelings a lot more.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.848
She's under the impression
I wanna pull

10:15.915 --> 10:19.085
and that's why I feel like
she's breaking things off now.

10:19.151 --> 10:21.053
But I'm quite happy with her.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.489
Anyways,
let's stop talking about this.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.125
Yeah?

10:26.192 --> 10:28.928
I know me and Gary are doing
our own thing tonight,

10:28.995 --> 10:31.864
but I'll still be furious
if he pulls.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.200
Christmas is here.

10:34.266 --> 10:36.235
I think I'm in for a right treat.

10:37.069 --> 10:39.071
Let's fill some fucking stockings.

10:40.973 --> 10:45.244
The boys are doing
some synchronised muff diving.

10:49.682 --> 10:52.118
(all) Merry Christmas! Why-aye!

10:54.120 --> 10:54.320
.

10:56.856 --> 10:57.056
.

11:06.532 --> 11:09.869
Tonight is a big one. It's
James's birthday. It's Christmas.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.103
It's gonna be amazing.

11:13.239 --> 11:16.375
Christmas is here. All I need is
some people to party with.

11:17.843 --> 11:18.878
(screaming)

11:22.748 --> 11:25.051
I've invited a lad
I've known for a while.

11:25.117 --> 11:27.486
He's fit and he's always up
for a good time.

11:27.553 --> 11:28.587
You look lovely.

11:28.654 --> 11:31.023
Now we can get this party started.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.798
Kate looks absolutely beautiful.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.967
I can't wait
to get my claws on Mrs Claus.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.409
I just hope there's no kick-offs.

11:50.476 --> 11:53.079
Imagine everyone fighting
dressed like this.

12:01.287 --> 12:06.258
So Marnie's friend has got a friend
and he is fit!

12:06.325 --> 12:07.827
How you doing?
How are you?

12:07.893 --> 12:09.095
I'm good, thanks.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.764
I know, do you like it?

12:11.831 --> 12:13.933
Doesn't she looks sexy
for a pudding?

12:13.999 --> 12:15.601
Tonight I'm on the pull.

12:15.668 --> 12:19.238
I'm free and I'm single and it's
about time I started acting like it.

12:25.811 --> 12:27.413
Casual sex and pizza?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.815
If that's not flirty,
I don't know what is.

12:29.882 --> 12:33.185
Marnie's friend.
Wants pizza and casual sex?

12:34.487 --> 12:37.289
He wants casual sex and pizza.
That sounds amazing.

12:51.637 --> 12:53.706
I'm talking to my brother
about Holly

12:53.772 --> 12:56.575
and he's never seen us
like this over a bird before.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.544
He's just used to me pulling lasses.

13:06.852 --> 13:11.223
Kyle and his brother are talking
about me, so I'm gonna go say hi.

13:16.929 --> 13:19.165
Is it?

13:19.231 --> 13:21.300
I finally get
to meet Kyle's brother.

13:21.367 --> 13:24.303
I'm meeting the family now.
This is getting serious.

13:27.840 --> 13:30.976
I can't believe I've kissed
Holly in front of me brother.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.512
It's like
I'm in a full-on relationship now.

13:38.450 --> 13:41.654
(Aaron) Marnie's necking on
with a lad. Fine by me.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.690
She can't give me any grief
for any girls I wanna pull.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.969
I look over
and see Charlotte with some lad.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.338
We only finished an hour ago. Cheers.

13:59.405 --> 14:02.408
This fit lad is approaching us
with mistletoe.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.677
What the hell do I do?

14:10.983 --> 14:12.351
That felt so good.

14:14.553 --> 14:18.424
What are you trying to do here?
Are you trying to make me jealous?

14:23.762 --> 14:25.998
Gary says he's happy
Charlotte moved on,

14:26.065 --> 14:30.269
but I think he's putting on a brave
face. I can tell by looking at him.

14:53.092 --> 14:56.895
I've had the best birthday ever and
me and Kate are absolutely mortal.

14:56.962 --> 15:00.866
It's the first house party we've had
where there's been no drama.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.606
The good thing about
a Geordie Shore party

15:07.673 --> 15:09.975
is that you're never far
from the bedroom.

15:10.042 --> 15:12.044
Let's fill some fucking stockings.

15:15.114 --> 15:17.416
I don't give a fuck that
Aaron's pulling.

15:17.483 --> 15:21.353
It's been a long time since I've had
any action and I'm fucking excited.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.439
I've had the best birthday ever.

15:40.506 --> 15:44.276
It's been the first party we've had
where there's been no kick-offs.

15:44.343 --> 15:45.911
Result. It's been class.

15:54.086 --> 15:57.456
Everyone's leaving. Me and Charlotte
are so into our boys,

15:57.523 --> 16:00.426
we've already decided
we're gonna have a sleepover.

16:06.265 --> 16:09.468
We're all drunk
and we are all necking on.

16:09.535 --> 16:11.437
Things are starting to get steamy.

16:14.006 --> 16:16.408
It's like one big hot tub orgy.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.051
Tonight has been proper mint.

16:26.118 --> 16:29.988
There's one thing left to do
and that's hang the stockings up.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.027
The boys are being really cute.

16:35.094 --> 16:37.096
They're hanging the stockings up.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.398
Now I'm excited
for Christmas morning.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.638
Buzzing. Sorted.

16:46.705 --> 16:51.210
Being together on Christmas is gonna
be amazing, but Vicky isn't here.

16:51.276 --> 16:54.880
I'm just wondering now if
it's the end of a Vicky era.

16:56.915 --> 17:00.052
One, two, three.

17:00.119 --> 17:04.522
Oh, so the boys are doing
some synchronised muff diving.

17:12.231 --> 17:16.201
Tonight has been absolutely amazing,
but we've got to get ourselves to bed

17:16.268 --> 17:18.470
or we'll be hungover
for Christmas Day.

17:20.005 --> 17:23.976
So we're heading upstairs and after
what's just happened in the hot tub,

17:24.041 --> 17:25.844
I think I'm in for a right treat.

17:34.186 --> 17:37.890
I know it might look bad, but I've
just finished things off with Gary

17:37.956 --> 17:41.193
and in a weird way, I need to do
this to prove I'm free.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.065
I'm so happy with Kyle.

17:47.132 --> 17:49.501
I've not felt like this
in such a long time.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.371
I'm buzzing. But I'm
still not gonna sleep with him.

17:57.075 --> 17:59.478
(Holly laughs)

18:00.446 --> 18:03.248
It's Christmas
and I've gotta stuff that turkey.

18:03.315 --> 18:06.685
What's the matter, Poochie Bear,
do you not like your present?

18:06.752 --> 18:09.788
Nappies.
For Christmas I got nappies.

18:09.855 --> 18:10.923
(cheering)

18:10.989 --> 18:13.692
Everyone's got Christmas jumpers on.
It's wicked.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.433
(all) Merry Christmas! Why-aye!

18:23.669 --> 18:23.869
.

18:26.405 --> 18:26.605
.

18:40.085 --> 18:42.654
It's Christmas!
I've gotta stuff that turkey.

18:42.721 --> 18:46.291
And I'm waking Scott up
cos I'm not doing it by myself.

18:48.093 --> 18:51.763
I've got Santa's little helper
breathing down my ear.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.600
We need to get this turkey prepared
for these twats.

18:57.903 --> 18:59.338
It was good, wasn't it?

18:59.404 --> 19:03.408
Me and Marnie were in the Jacuzzi
with them two lads.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.246
Scott's asking if I had sex.

19:07.312 --> 19:11.183
(sighs) I feel so bad.
Like, do I lie? Can I lie?

19:12.651 --> 19:14.219
Yeah!
(laughs)

19:14.286 --> 19:17.656
Yeah, I got stuffed like
this turkey is getting stuffed now.

19:17.723 --> 19:21.159
(laughs)
That's fucking mad, that, like.

19:21.226 --> 19:25.697
I know Gaz and I know that he won't
say a thing when he finds out,

19:25.764 --> 19:28.066
but inside he'll be fucking raging.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.602
Before last night,
I did think to myself,

19:30.669 --> 19:33.238
"Shit, I'm starting
to like Gary again,"

19:33.305 --> 19:36.775
and then last night
I didn't think about him once.

19:36.842 --> 19:40.846
Last night I slept with another boy
and didn't care what Gary was doing.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.948
This might be me moving on for good.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.384
Oh, oh...

19:45.450 --> 19:48.987
Fucking hell, Charlotte's canny good
at stuffing this turkey.

19:49.054 --> 19:52.691
She must have gained the experience
when that lad was stuffing her.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.493
Everyone gets an orange.

19:58.630 --> 20:00.299
I'm going to wake the girls up.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.901
Meet Charlotte,
the Christmassy tinsel troll.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.504
It's Christmas day, bitches!

20:05.571 --> 20:09.007
I'm the Christmastime elf! Woo-hoo!

20:09.074 --> 20:13.679
Christmas time, boys!
It's Christmas time!

20:13.745 --> 20:17.616
Wakey-wakey, lads! It's fucking
Christmas time, you bunch of socks!

20:17.683 --> 20:21.687
Last night was good, wasn't it?
What the hell did you do?

20:21.753 --> 20:24.122
(laughter)

20:24.189 --> 20:26.692
Me and Marnie had sex.
Oh, my God!

20:26.758 --> 20:30.062
I can't believe me and Charlotte
both had sex last night.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.364
We were spreading the Christmas joy.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.537
I've had
a little bit of a revelation.

20:38.604 --> 20:42.808
I was speaking to Kyle last night
and I was speaking to his brother,

20:42.874 --> 20:46.044
and his brother said,
"I feel like he's changed."

20:46.111 --> 20:48.347
"I've never seen him
like this before."

20:48.413 --> 20:49.815
I'm so happy for Holly.

20:49.881 --> 20:53.518
Last night was amazing for her
and I think she's finally realising

20:53.585 --> 20:55.187
Kyle actually does like her.

20:55.253 --> 20:58.156
Maybe tonight is... the night.

20:58.223 --> 21:01.093
I didn't wanna be pressured into
sleeping with Kyle

21:01.159 --> 21:03.095
when I didn't know if I trusted him,

21:03.161 --> 21:06.565
but after speaking to his brother,
I feel reassured.

21:17.876 --> 21:20.212
Had a fucking wicked night
last night.

21:20.278 --> 21:22.280
I nearly got close
to shagging Holly

21:22.347 --> 21:24.149
and tonight will be the night.

21:27.919 --> 21:30.255
I'm a bit gutted
Charlotte banged that lad,

21:30.322 --> 21:33.625
but if that's what she wants to do
I have to come to terms with it.

21:40.165 --> 21:44.403
Gaz is saying it's a good thing
she banged that lad last night.

21:44.469 --> 21:48.073
I can hear your tears trying to
crawl out the back of your eyes.

21:50.575 --> 21:51.777
No!

21:51.843 --> 21:55.013
I'm not bothered that Marnie shagged
a random last night.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.982
The boys agree she's playing games.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.117
If that's the case,
I'm not interested.

22:01.586 --> 22:03.221
See you later.

22:03.288 --> 22:06.324
I feel like Vicky
cannot miss Christmas Day.

22:06.391 --> 22:08.960
She's part of this family.

22:09.027 --> 22:11.329
(Holly) I love mine!

22:11.396 --> 22:12.964
Jesus Christ, this is tight.

22:13.031 --> 22:16.802
It would have been better if I had
a Christmas vest, but this will do.

22:17.602 --> 22:20.439
These must be special
Geordie Christmas stockings

22:20.505 --> 22:24.042
because the girls got eyelashes
and the boys got fake tan.

22:27.479 --> 22:31.083
I feel like she died and then
we hang the stocking up for memory.

22:31.149 --> 22:33.452
Vicky's stocking is there for her,

22:33.518 --> 22:35.721
and we don't know
if she's gonna come.

22:35.787 --> 22:37.522
I'm gonna get back to cooking.

22:37.589 --> 22:41.093
This house is an absolute tip,
so while I cook Christmas dinner,

22:41.159 --> 22:44.329
they need to clean up
ready for the Christmas meal.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.768
We've never had Christmas together
so Scott's got the cooking going on,

22:49.835 --> 22:52.838
we're setting the table with
our Christmas jumpers on.

22:52.904 --> 22:54.506
It's actually going wicked.

22:54.573 --> 22:57.743
Come on, let's get the presents.
Places round the table!

22:57.809 --> 23:01.179
It's time to do Secret Santa.
This is gonna be good.

23:01.246 --> 23:03.548
(laughter)

23:03.615 --> 23:05.250
Colouring book!
(laughter)

23:05.317 --> 23:06.818
I got Aaron a colouring book

23:06.885 --> 23:09.621
cos he's running out of places
to get tattoos.

23:09.688 --> 23:13.692
An iron! (laughter)
I'm fucking happy with that.

23:13.759 --> 23:15.660
I got an iron and an ironing board.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.697
I'll walk around
being a non-creased man.

23:18.764 --> 23:20.732
(laughter)

23:20.799 --> 23:24.469
Scott's bought us a bracelet with
a love heart on and Holly's name.

23:24.536 --> 23:26.872
I should get him one
with Gary's name on.

23:27.773 --> 23:31.543
Protein! Never have enough protein,
can you?

23:34.012 --> 23:36.748
(laughter)

23:36.815 --> 23:41.686
It was a mug with "drama queen" on
and a free taxi home, what the fuck?

23:44.523 --> 23:46.858
I got cookies and a vibrator.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.162
Holly, did you buy these for yourself
and just get mixed up?

23:50.228 --> 23:52.998
I fucking knew it was this.
(laughter)

23:53.064 --> 23:55.567
I've got fucking nappies!

23:55.634 --> 23:57.135
Nappies!

23:57.202 --> 24:00.305
For Christmas, I've got nappies.
What the hell?

24:00.372 --> 24:05.844
Charlotte, there's something else.
I know what it's gonna be in there!

24:05.911 --> 24:08.980
(laughter)

24:09.047 --> 24:11.383
The one thing Charlotte needs
is nappies.

24:11.449 --> 24:14.786
Other thing I got her was
a necklace with my picture on.

24:14.853 --> 24:16.254
Are you having a bad time?

24:16.321 --> 24:17.989
(laughter)

24:18.056 --> 24:20.625
Who knew James actually had
a sense of humour?

24:20.692 --> 24:23.128
He's went and got Kyle and Holly
a photo frame

24:23.195 --> 24:26.364
with "Poochie Bear" written on it.
(laughter)

24:26.431 --> 24:31.002
Holly loves her present,
but Kyle looks sick of his life.

24:31.069 --> 24:35.540
Aw, what's the matter, Poochie Bear,
do you not like your present?

24:35.607 --> 24:37.209
Last present!
(cheering)

24:37.275 --> 24:41.146
Everyone's having fun. Christmas Day,
we've never had together.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.481
You can smell the turkey.
It's wicked.

24:52.123 --> 24:54.059
Oh, my God! It's Vicky!

24:54.125 --> 24:56.895
I'm so buzzing.
If she'd had missed Christmas Day,

24:56.962 --> 25:00.332
I wouldn't have ever spoke
to her again.

25:00.398 --> 25:03.268
I walk in and the house is
all done up for Christmas

25:03.335 --> 25:07.172
and they're around the dinner table
and I'm so pleased I came back.

25:07.239 --> 25:10.208
So, are yous happy to see us?
(all agree) Good.

25:10.275 --> 25:14.379
I'm buzzing Vicky's back.
We couldn't have ended without her.

25:14.446 --> 25:18.516
What have I missed?
The Boyfriend Club's over.

25:21.953 --> 25:25.457
That turkey in the oven's not
the only bird that got stuffed.

25:25.523 --> 25:28.526
Marnie and Charlotte had sex,
and not with each other,

25:28.593 --> 25:31.229
and not with Gaz and Aaron.
Well in, lasses.

25:33.064 --> 25:35.734
I'm so buzzing that
Vicky has decided to show up.

25:35.800 --> 25:38.603
Now we've got
the whole family back together.

25:38.670 --> 25:41.673
It's time to dish out the scran.
(cheering)

25:43.174 --> 25:47.078
Well done to Scotty T. He'll make
someone a good housewife one day.

25:49.814 --> 25:52.250
Merry Christmas, everyone!
(all toast)

25:56.354 --> 25:59.157
I would have been so gutted
if I'd missed this.

25:59.224 --> 26:02.861
I think this is the nicest meal
we've ever had, Scott, well done.

26:02.928 --> 26:06.197
It's lovely, absolutely class.
You've done well, Scotty.

26:06.264 --> 26:10.302
I never thought I'd be having
Christmas dinner with these idiots

26:10.368 --> 26:13.538
in Christmas jumpers
and in good spirits. It's amazing.

26:13.605 --> 26:17.142
Everyone get a drink? Cool,
and we'll make a little toast.

26:17.208 --> 26:19.644
Today has been so lovely.

26:19.711 --> 26:24.249
Looking round this table, I love
every person in their own way

26:24.316 --> 26:26.685
which is why what I'm about to say
is so hard.

26:26.751 --> 26:32.023
I promised I couldn't leave yous,
and I said I'd come back.

26:39.831 --> 26:41.466
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

26:41.533 --> 26:42.634
I can't...

26:44.035 --> 26:47.605
I can't stay.
When?

26:47.672 --> 26:52.210
I've loved every single minute
of doing this with yous.

26:55.447 --> 26:59.751
But unfortunately for me,
this is the end. It's over.

27:01.686 --> 27:03.888
I feel as though
I'm letting them down.

27:07.392 --> 27:10.028
(Vicky sobs)

27:10.095 --> 27:14.733
How could she leave us? (sobs)

27:14.799 --> 27:17.602
She's like our sister.

27:17.669 --> 27:22.640
And I can't imagine going one day
in this house without her.

27:30.615 --> 27:35.420
We've come such a long way over the
years and I just can't believe it.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.289
Yous have all been there for us
at some point so much.

27:40.558 --> 27:42.727
I'm literally fucking devastated.

27:42.794 --> 27:45.063
I cannot believe
she's actually leaving.

27:48.666 --> 27:51.503
You've been...
We came here all together.

27:51.569 --> 27:54.406
It's been a long time now, you know.

27:59.411 --> 28:02.680
I'm trying to tell Vicky
that it's been an amazing journey

28:02.747 --> 28:04.482
and even I'm filling up.

28:05.683 --> 28:06.851
I'm sorry.

28:06.918 --> 28:10.588
This is one of the hardest decisions
I've ever had to make.

28:10.655 --> 28:15.560
Although I love everyone there,
it's just not for me any more.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.930
Charlotte and Holly
are crying their eyes out.

28:18.997 --> 28:21.266
Vicky was the one they went to
for advice.

28:21.332 --> 28:23.835
The lads are gonna have
to be there for them now.

28:34.145 --> 28:37.382
I'm gonna miss
Charlotte and Holly the most.

28:37.449 --> 28:41.986
They're like a cross between
me kids and me sisters,

28:42.053 --> 28:46.224
and I'm so worried
about leaving them on their own,

28:46.291 --> 28:50.161
cos I haven't really baby-proofed
the house or anything.

28:57.135 --> 29:01.239
Now I realise the true value of
how much I need and I love her.

29:01.306 --> 29:06.044
I just love her so much. I can't
bear thinking of her not being here.

29:06.111 --> 29:09.547
What do you do if his penis
looks green, Charlotte?

29:12.283 --> 29:17.222
They might be the most fucked-up
family in the world,

29:17.288 --> 29:18.490
but they're my family.

29:21.793 --> 29:24.696
Everyone is so, so upset
to see Vicky leave

29:24.762 --> 29:26.965
so we're gonna gather round
the garden,

29:27.031 --> 29:28.766
I'm gonna put the snow machine on

29:28.833 --> 29:31.769
and we're gonna have
one last big family cuddle.

29:37.008 --> 29:39.544
I don't know how me
and Charlotte are gonna cope.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.080
She's been here since day one

29:42.147 --> 29:44.449
and I don't know
what we'll do without her.

29:44.516 --> 29:46.084
Hip-hip!
(all) Hooray!

29:46.151 --> 29:47.585
Hip-hip!
(all) Hooray!

29:47.652 --> 29:49.087
Hip-hip!
(all) Hooray!

29:49.154 --> 29:51.089
Group hug. Get in the middle.

29:52.557 --> 29:53.858
Fuck off.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.760
Suck us, peasants.

30:03.868 --> 30:05.637
Will you marry us?
Yes.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.907
You're a fucking arsehole!

30:08.973 --> 30:11.009
Wanker!
(laughter)

30:11.075 --> 30:15.647
We have an incredible bond.
It focuses solely around tequila.

30:16.881 --> 30:19.717
Looks like the cat
that got chlamydia.

30:19.784 --> 30:21.052
(mumbles)

30:21.119 --> 30:22.620
(vomits)
Tramp.

30:22.687 --> 30:27.625
I'll fold you into the shape of a
fucking paper bird, you daft slag!

30:27.692 --> 30:30.828
There's no I in team,
but there is a U in cunt.

30:31.729 --> 30:33.698
Go on, lass, you fucking slapper!

30:33.765 --> 30:37.735
What are you doing, you stupid slag?!
That's fucking Gary!

30:37.802 --> 30:40.405
Vicky, tick.
(laughs)

30:42.073 --> 30:44.042
Everybody grab a vagina!

30:44.108 --> 30:46.878
I'm pretty sure I just saw someone
slip a finger in.

30:50.448 --> 30:54.252
I'm getting overtones of...
pretentious fucking wanker.

31:04.829 --> 31:07.065
God, I love that bunch of bell-ends.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.103
Bye, house!

31:12.170 --> 31:16.007
Vicky is the most beautiful,
compassionate,

31:16.074 --> 31:19.777
strongest woman I've ever met,

31:19.844 --> 31:25.149
and I feel so pleasured to have been
able to learn things from her.

31:25.216 --> 31:29.354
Some of the longest words I know
have come from Vicky.

31:32.690 --> 31:35.026
Fucking get back inside,
you set of cunts!

31:35.093 --> 31:36.127
(laughter)

31:36.194 --> 31:39.264
I'm gonna miss
the Geordie Shore house so much.

31:39.330 --> 31:42.667
I really do just want
the best for them.

31:46.671 --> 31:50.575
Fetch me my steed,
for tonight, we drink for Vicky!

31:51.843 --> 31:55.013
There's no harm
in one last farewell kiss.

31:58.016 --> 32:01.386
Being the good guy
pays off in the end.

32:03.855 --> 32:06.291
(all) Merry Christmas! Why-aye!

32:08.559 --> 32:08.760
.

32:11.296 --> 32:11.496
.

32:21.706 --> 32:25.109
Vicky's been gone two seconds
and the house is in ruins.

32:25.176 --> 32:27.945
I don't know how anyone's
gonna pick themselves up.

32:33.184 --> 32:37.989
We were all having such a good day,
Christmas dinner, Vicky came back,

32:38.056 --> 32:40.291
it was like everything
was right again

32:40.358 --> 32:44.162
and now this has happened.
It's just ruined it all.

32:44.228 --> 32:48.800
In her honour, let's go out
the way that Vicky came in

32:48.866 --> 32:50.935
and have a mint night out together.

32:51.002 --> 32:52.770
Let's just fucking go berserk.

32:52.837 --> 32:56.808
We need to go out with a bang,
no matter how anyone's feeling.

33:02.080 --> 33:06.818
You there, fetch me my steed,
for tonight, we drink for Vicky!

33:06.884 --> 33:08.720
And we do off at dawn!

33:20.231 --> 33:22.533
Cannot believe
this is the last night.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.435
I love this lot so fucking much.

33:36.848 --> 33:40.585
It's the last night and I just feel
myself gravitating towards Gary

33:40.651 --> 33:42.420
for one last kiss.

33:42.487 --> 33:45.456
Shit, Charlotte and Gary are kissing

33:45.523 --> 33:50.194
and I feel so happy because
I know deep down she loves him.

33:51.329 --> 33:53.731
There's no harm in
one last farewell kiss.

34:00.571 --> 34:03.541
Everyone is having
such a good night.

34:03.608 --> 34:07.478
I love Kyle, Charlotte,
Marnie, Gary, Aaron, Scott

34:07.545 --> 34:10.715
and I even love James.
This is wicked.

34:16.254 --> 34:18.688
Oh, my God,
I feel like I'm in a movie.

34:18.755 --> 34:21.893
Kyle's just wished me merry
Christmas and gave me a kiss,

34:21.958 --> 34:24.161
and it's made me feel weird
and magical.

34:27.431 --> 34:31.803
I bet on my fucking life I am gonna
get a Christmas present off Holly.

34:51.054 --> 34:54.324
It's our last night out.
I wanna make things up with Marnie.

34:54.391 --> 34:56.327
I don't wanna leave on bad terms.

35:00.798 --> 35:02.967
Me and Aaron have been through
so much.

35:03.034 --> 35:07.238
We've argued, then we've made up,
but at least we can laugh about it.

35:14.011 --> 35:17.682
I don't know if it's the tequila
or because it's the last night,

35:17.748 --> 35:20.284
but me and Marnie are getting
really close.

35:26.424 --> 35:29.360
Love is in the air tonight.
Charlotte and Gary made up,

35:29.427 --> 35:31.329
me and Aaron have made up.

35:31.395 --> 35:35.032
It seems like everything
has been forgotten.

35:38.903 --> 35:42.240
We're having the best night ever,
everyone's mortal.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.774
I just don't want it to end.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.619
Bijoux, you've been done.

35:54.685 --> 35:57.788
Time to get back cos this party
is just getting started.

36:00.525 --> 36:01.659
Howay, whistle dick.

36:01.726 --> 36:04.295
We all know what happens on
the last night.

36:04.362 --> 36:08.866
Everyone gets in the hot tub
and gets even more mortal.

36:21.612 --> 36:25.917
Charlotte is absolutely smashed
and when she gets this pissed,

36:25.983 --> 36:28.386
you need to pick her up
and take her to bed.

36:30.721 --> 36:34.125
I probably shouldn't be kissing Gary
but it's the last night,

36:34.191 --> 36:35.826
so this is for old times' sake.

36:42.967 --> 36:46.237
The next thing you know, me and
Marnie in the hot tub, mortal.

36:46.304 --> 36:48.072
God knows where this is gonna go.

36:49.407 --> 36:50.575
Have ya?
Yeah.

36:50.641 --> 36:53.978
I don't know what it is about Aaron
but the boy can't do wrong.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.813
I always run back to him.

37:01.085 --> 37:02.420
Tonight's been amazing

37:02.486 --> 37:06.123
and I don't want to end anywhere
else but in the shag pad with Aaron.

37:11.395 --> 37:14.599
Me and Kyle go to bed
and I feel like a virgin again.

37:14.665 --> 37:17.702
I feel like I'm about to pop
my cherry for the first time

37:17.768 --> 37:19.537
and I'm so, so, so excited.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.639
(moaning)

37:21.706 --> 37:25.643
I have waited so long for this.
This is gonna be the best sex ever!

37:29.513 --> 37:31.749
Wow, I forgot how good this was.

37:31.816 --> 37:34.085
Why the fuck
have I been waiting so long?

37:38.456 --> 37:41.459
I've proved that being the good guy
pays off in the end,

37:41.525 --> 37:43.527
and this was worth the wait.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.865
(laughs)

37:59.076 --> 38:01.646
What did yous two get up to?
Had sex!

38:02.880 --> 38:05.983
I can't believe I waited that long
to have sex with Kyle.

38:06.050 --> 38:09.286
I forget how amazing it was.
Kyle is mint in bed.

38:09.353 --> 38:10.988
So what's next for yous two?

38:14.225 --> 38:17.361
Too soon!
That's not a joke!

38:17.428 --> 38:18.963
That was too soon!

38:19.030 --> 38:21.799
I've stayed strong
and I've stayed true to my word

38:21.866 --> 38:23.367
and I do really like Holly.

38:25.002 --> 38:28.239
Last night me and Gary lay in bed
next to each other.

38:28.305 --> 38:31.609
Nothing happened,
just being best friends.

38:31.676 --> 38:32.910
This is a new start.

38:34.111 --> 38:35.613
Last night was so good.

38:40.284 --> 38:43.688
I can't believe it's the last day
and we've gotta go home.

38:43.754 --> 38:45.156
I'm absolutely gutted.

38:50.327 --> 38:53.998
I'm literally gonna miss
this house so much.

38:55.399 --> 38:56.734
I don't know.

38:56.801 --> 38:59.704
I would never just go up to Gary
and say, "Let's kiss,"

38:59.770 --> 39:02.640
but I just had
the confidence to do it,

39:02.707 --> 39:05.443
cos I feel like I kind of have
a little bit of power,

39:05.509 --> 39:09.480
cos I slept with someone and then
I still kissed him afterwards.

39:09.547 --> 39:13.284
This time around I felt like it was
me in control of the relationship.

39:13.350 --> 39:15.786
And it's not that
I don't wanna be with Gary,

39:15.853 --> 39:17.254
I just need headspace.

39:19.990 --> 39:24.261
I do like him.
I will see him on the outside.

39:24.328 --> 39:25.496
(gasps)

39:25.563 --> 39:27.998
I know that me and Kyle are
in such a good place

39:28.065 --> 39:30.267
cos I made him wait,
and I'm so glad I did.

39:35.406 --> 39:36.841
I love ya.

39:36.907 --> 39:40.010
It doesn't matter what we go
through, we argue, we fight,

39:40.077 --> 39:43.647
but we always come together
because we're a family.

39:46.684 --> 39:49.053
Me and Marnie have been
all over the place,

39:49.120 --> 39:52.223
but I'm glad we sorted
wor differences out.

39:52.289 --> 39:54.391
See you later.
See you later, Aaron.

39:56.727 --> 39:58.295
Brother.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.599
Bye, Scott!
Bye!

40:01.665 --> 40:04.068
This time round for me
has been wicked,

40:04.135 --> 40:06.737
but it's time to R2-do-one
and get the fuck out.

40:06.804 --> 40:09.440
It's been amazing.
Oh, I'm gonna miss you.

40:09.507 --> 40:13.511
I love everyone, even though we're
a fucked up, dysfunctional family.

40:14.912 --> 40:17.548
Yeah, you can come meet my mum!
(laughter)

40:17.615 --> 40:20.651
I think it's only right that
me and Kyle have got so close

40:20.718 --> 40:23.287
I take him to meet my mum,
so I'll give him a lift.

40:23.354 --> 40:24.922
Oh, my God.

40:24.989 --> 40:27.958
Look after her. (laughter)

40:28.025 --> 40:29.627
Holly's giving us a lift home

40:29.693 --> 40:32.596
and I'm glad I get
a bit more time to be with her.

40:32.663 --> 40:34.165
Bye, love yous!

40:36.767 --> 40:39.436
As always,
me and Charlotte leave last.

40:39.503 --> 40:43.307
It just seems right that we have
our last little moment together.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.148
But are you happy about it?
Yeah, it's wicked.

40:51.215 --> 40:52.716
But I didn't expect it.

40:52.783 --> 40:55.820
No matter how much Gary makes us
angry and frustrated,

40:55.886 --> 40:58.622
I'll always love him
deep down in some weird way.

40:58.689 --> 41:02.259
It was Paris when I realised
that I'd rather spend more time

41:02.326 --> 41:04.762
being closer to you
than have a boyfriend.

41:04.829 --> 41:08.165
This time round me and Charlotte
went through so much again.

41:08.232 --> 41:12.002
Maybe the timing just wasn't right,
but one thing I have realised is,

41:12.069 --> 41:13.637
I wanna be in a relationship.

41:17.474 --> 41:18.909
Maybe one day.

41:18.976 --> 41:22.413
I don't know what's gonna happen
with me and Gary in the future.

41:22.479 --> 41:25.216
All I know now is I just need
some time to be on my own.

41:25.282 --> 41:27.084
Come here.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.119
You know I'll always love you.

41:29.186 --> 41:31.655
Charlotte says she loves us.
I love her, too.

41:31.722 --> 41:33.624
We've had the best time ever.

41:35.926 --> 41:37.161
I love you to bits, too.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.463
Me and Gary have been through a lot

41:39.530 --> 41:42.666
but at the end of the day,
he'll always be my Gary.

41:46.604 --> 41:49.607
Walking out that house,
I turned round, had one last look

41:49.673 --> 41:52.810
and I can't wait to come
walking back through that door

41:52.877 --> 41:55.079
and make some new memories.

41:56.213 --> 41:57.915
Let's get fucking mortal!

41:59.650 --> 42:01.118
I'm in charge, bitches!

42:01.185 --> 42:04.788
Why should I clean that shit hole?
Because you're not the boss!

42:04.855 --> 42:07.024
Vicky is Margaret Thatcher.
Fuck off.

42:07.091 --> 42:08.359
But less dead.

42:08.425 --> 42:10.995
The Boyfriend Club.
Kill it, bitches.

42:14.965 --> 42:18.202
Me and Marnie just can't seem
to stay away from each other.

42:22.873 --> 42:26.176
I'm kissing Charlotte.
I feel like I've gone back in time.

42:26.243 --> 42:30.547
Me and Gary are having sex.
My fanny is so worried.

42:31.916 --> 42:33.083
(both) No!

42:33.150 --> 42:36.520
Fuck off! Mad dog Marnie's
escaped out of her cage!

42:36.587 --> 42:39.823
Whoa, whoa, shit.

42:41.759 --> 42:43.360
I fucking hate you!

42:43.427 --> 42:48.165
Psycho Charlotte is back.
I can't be fucked with this.

42:48.232 --> 42:51.302
Why the fuck is this happening?
Yeah, Tour de France.

42:51.368 --> 42:56.206
If the Eiffel Tower was a penis,
I'd let it cum all over my face.

42:56.273 --> 42:57.574
Shag pad!

42:57.641 --> 43:00.244
Scotty T minotaur!

43:00.311 --> 43:01.912
(both) I'm gonna get mortal!

43:04.281 --> 43:05.382
(laughter)

43:05.449 --> 43:08.252
Somebody pass me a cup.
(vomits)

43:08.319 --> 43:12.523
Stop naming vegetables! Charlotte's
having a shit above my head.

43:12.589 --> 43:16.060
I look like a giant piece of shit.

43:16.126 --> 43:17.394
Give us a cuddle.

43:19.663 --> 43:23.567
I'm really pissed and I just want
a cuddle from Gary, just Gary.

43:24.401 --> 43:26.103
Come here. I'll sort you out.

43:26.170 --> 43:29.707
I'll always be close to Gary.
He is so special to us.

43:31.709 --> 43:35.212
Everyone in this house argues,
fights, people shag each other,

43:35.279 --> 43:40.284
and punch each other,
but I love every single one of them.

43:40.351 --> 43:42.786
Shall we get married?
What?

43:42.853 --> 43:43.854
(laughs)

43:47.224 --> 43:49.693
(Vicky) 'Get back inside,
you set of cunts.'

44:14.485 --> 44:14.685
.
