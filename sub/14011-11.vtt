Although inspired in part by a true incident the following story
is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event.

00:05.682 --> 00:08.337
In New York City's war on crime,

00:08.372 --> 00:11.584
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.619 --> 00:13.666
of the Major Case Squad.

00:13.701 --> 00:15.714
These are their stories.

00:17.805 --> 00:20.756
Let's see what the
birds are doing in the park.

00:20.791 --> 00:21.627
Can you see them?

00:21.662 --> 00:23.525
Yes, they're playing in the trees.

00:25.548 --> 00:28.096
Oh, time for Daddy to go to work.

00:30.658 --> 00:33.133
- Good morning, everybody.
- How are you doing?

00:56.707 --> 00:57.581
Good morning.

00:57.616 --> 01:01.284
First patient's prepped in room two.
She's 19, single, in the 10th week.

01:01.319 --> 01:02.336
Name is Patricia.

01:02.371 --> 01:03.878
- Who's here with her?
- One of her friends.

01:03.913 --> 01:06.202
Her boyfriend was supposed
to drive her but never showed.

01:06.237 --> 01:07.316
How is she feeling?

01:07.351 --> 01:08.789
Scared.

01:08.824 --> 01:10.579
Let's see what we can do about that.

01:11.354 --> 01:12.236
Lunch time.

01:12.271 --> 01:13.361
All right, children,

01:13.396 --> 01:15.292
let's close our books
and put our pencils down.

01:15.327 --> 01:16.952
Somebody want
to help me with these?

01:17.361 --> 01:19.181
Put them on the floor.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.192
Everybody ready?

01:23.227 --> 01:26.096
Yeah. / Let's give thanks.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.943
Thank you, God,
for your bounty,

01:28.978 --> 01:30.276
today and every day.

01:30.311 --> 01:32.076
Amen / Amen.

01:32.111 --> 01:34.796
Oh, and thank you,
Dennis, for making lunch.

01:34.831 --> 01:36.757
Thank you.

01:38.561 --> 01:40.303
And what's a baby cow? / A calf.

01:40.338 --> 01:41.518
That's right.

01:41.553 --> 01:43.128
And what's a baby chicken?

01:43.163 --> 01:44.914
An egg.

01:44.949 --> 01:46.149
I'm going to make some tea.

01:46.184 --> 01:48.043
Does anyone
want anything?/ Juice.

01:48.171 --> 01:49.527
What comes out of the egg?

01:49.562 --> 01:51.135
Baby chicks.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.396
Yeah.

02:03.444 --> 02:04.917
I want to see the cars, Daddy.

02:04.952 --> 02:06.180
Okay.

02:06.215 --> 02:07.560
Come here.

02:11.974 --> 02:14.390
Lord, steady my hand

02:14.425 --> 02:17.532
and let Thy justice find its mark.

02:24.134 --> 02:26.863
Can you see the cars? / Yes.

02:52.945 --> 02:56.307
Honey, are you sure
you don't want any...

03:01.822 --> 03:03.394
Get into the bedroom now. Quick.

03:03.429 --> 03:04.967
Quick, quick, quick.

03:05.002 --> 03:06.506
Oh my God, Leo, hold on.

03:06.679 --> 03:08.212
Hold on.

03:08.684 --> 03:11.468
Hello, my husband's been shot.

03:11.503 --> 03:14.837
Our address is 845 Central
Park West, apartment 4A.

03:14.872 --> 03:16.325
My name is Marie Cavella.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.175
Hurry.

03:17.210 --> 03:18.621
Oh my God, Leo, hold on.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.033
They're coming, honey.

03:20.068 --> 03:20.963
They're coming!

03:20.998 --> 03:21.956
Hold on!

03:21.991 --> 03:24.877
I love you! Hold on!

04:24.623 --> 04:28.495
It looks like he was 80
to 100 feet into the park.

04:29.226 --> 04:30.833
That makes it
about a 200-yard shot.

04:30.868 --> 04:32.674
This guy had practice.

04:39.415 --> 04:41.951
Make sure you cover him up.

04:42.472 --> 04:44.448
In our own living room,

04:44.483 --> 04:46.390
in front of our baby.

04:46.425 --> 04:50.208
These people that say
they love children so much...

04:50.368 --> 04:52.336
Your husband get threats?

04:52.371 --> 04:54.270
There was this website,

04:54.305 --> 04:57.564
his name was on a hit
list of abortion providers,

04:57.599 --> 05:00.284
with our old address
in Dobbs Ferry.

05:00.319 --> 05:03.284
It's why we moved to the city...
to be safer.

05:03.319 --> 05:04.505
Our phone's unlisted,

05:04.540 --> 05:06.181
the condo's in
my maiden name,

05:06.216 --> 05:08.118
we have a post office box.

05:08.734 --> 05:10.622
Where was your
husband's clinic?

05:10.683 --> 05:11.904
In Bethel.

05:11.939 --> 05:13.619
Two hours each way, every day,

05:13.654 --> 05:15.697
because he wanted
to help people...

05:16.693 --> 05:19.049
They have no right.

05:19.510 --> 05:21.526
Oh God, Leo.

05:23.115 --> 05:26.068
We're very sorry, Mrs. Cavella.

05:30.545 --> 05:33.610
According to the calculations,
the shot came from this tree here.

05:33.645 --> 05:35.276
Any footprints?

05:35.311 --> 05:36.908
Ground's too hard.

05:40.391 --> 05:42.566
Would've put his knee down here.

05:48.811 --> 05:52.550
He tied his rifle to
the tree to stabilize it...

05:52.895 --> 05:55.743
so he'd have a shooting platform.

06:05.007 --> 06:09.225
He was an experienced hunter
or he had military training.

06:10.012 --> 06:11.394
How we doing on witnesses?

06:11.429 --> 06:13.850
We got one homeless lady,
calls herself God,

06:13.885 --> 06:16.271
said she saw a male,
white, going into the woods

06:16.306 --> 06:18.282
about a half an hour
before the shooting.

06:18.317 --> 06:20.259
Put "God" together
with a sketch artist.

06:20.412 --> 06:22.328
Keep the witness canvass
going for the next week,

06:22.363 --> 06:25.478
double up in the evenings
around the time of the shooting.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.975
Eames!

06:36.234 --> 06:38.786
It's a Remington 703-aught-8,

06:38.821 --> 06:41.339
with a Burris 3x10 scope.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.456
He brought it here piece by piece,

06:43.491 --> 06:45.808
assembled,
buried it until he needed it.

06:45.843 --> 06:49.667
I can already tell catching this
mutt's going to be a walk in the park.

06:52.907 --> 06:55.723
There are killers and there are
people who kill abortion doctors.

06:55.758 --> 06:57.634
There's two types of those:
The martyr...

06:57.669 --> 07:00.544
he kills without a lot of
planning in broad daylight,

07:00.579 --> 07:03.384
in front of witnesses,
with a shotgun or a handgun,

07:03.419 --> 07:05.759
- doesn't care if he gets caught.
- Then there's this guy.

07:05.794 --> 07:09.146
Months of preparation,
stalks his target,

07:09.181 --> 07:12.499
plans his escape,
kills from a distance,

07:12.534 --> 07:13.936
no intention of getting caught.

07:13.971 --> 07:16.703
He's in it to create fear.

07:17.009 --> 07:19.614
You know, kill one,
scare a thousand.

07:19.649 --> 07:21.610
Three witnesses, including God,

07:21.645 --> 07:25.852
saw a male, white, come out of the
woods near the 97th Street transverse.

07:25.887 --> 07:29.447
30s, medium to tall, baseball cap,
maybe a mustache, maybe brown hair.

07:29.482 --> 07:33.008
Maybe we put up flyers in the park,
maybe we get better witnesses.

07:33.043 --> 07:34.618
Take a look at this website.

07:34.653 --> 07:36.159
"The New Killing Fields. "

07:36.194 --> 07:38.933
Lists abortion
doctors in every state.

07:38.968 --> 07:40.735
Here. Leo Cavella.

07:40.770 --> 07:42.467
Still his old address.

07:42.502 --> 07:45.119
Any guesses what the slash
through his name means?

07:45.154 --> 07:46.479
It's a damn hit list.

07:46.514 --> 07:48.071
Protected by the First Amendment.

07:48.106 --> 07:50.776
- Of course.
- Ballistics report on the rifle.

07:50.811 --> 07:53.054
Figures, no fingerprints.

07:53.416 --> 07:55.874
Rifle traced to a gun
dealer in Pennsylvania

07:55.909 --> 07:58.689
who sold it at a gun show
in Honesdale eight weeks ago.

07:58.724 --> 08:00.634
- No ID on the buyer.
- Honesdale...

08:00.669 --> 08:04.940
that's just across the state line
from Cavella's clinic in Bethel.

08:05.061 --> 08:06.896
Bethel Women's Clinic Bethel,
New York Wednesday, May 31

08:06.931 --> 08:09.836
My husband drove Leo's van.
He never noticed anyone following.

08:09.871 --> 08:11.629
What about the
people with the signs?

08:11.664 --> 08:14.876
They regulars? / Every day since
the clinic opened four years ago.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.289
- We videotape them.
- We'll need those tapes.

08:17.324 --> 08:19.843
Those people are horrible,
always calling us names,

08:19.878 --> 08:21.752
yelling at the patients.

08:22.727 --> 08:25.853
Who on Dr. Cavella's
staff had his address?

08:25.888 --> 08:27.501
I did, in my address book,

08:27.536 --> 08:29.545
which I kept locked up in my office.

08:29.580 --> 08:31.555
Doctor Cavella's check register.

08:31.590 --> 08:32.996
Checks to Con Ed,

08:33.030 --> 08:34.368
to his condo board.

08:34.403 --> 08:36.484
After he paid his bills,
what did he do with them?

08:36.519 --> 08:37.561
Some he took home,

08:37.596 --> 08:39.602
some like his power
bill he threw away.

08:39.638 --> 08:41.610
Any problems with
his trash bin outside?

08:41.645 --> 08:42.470
A couple months ago.

08:42.505 --> 08:44.000
The police said it was raccoons.

08:44.034 --> 08:45.972
We bought cans
with animal-proof lids.

08:46.007 --> 08:47.542
How'd that work out?

08:47.577 --> 08:51.005
Two weeks later,
they got broken into again.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.555
Animal-proof lids. Nobody ever
gives raccoons enough credit.

08:54.590 --> 08:56.680
Your money's still on the raccoons.

08:56.715 --> 09:00.127
I just can't imagine anybody
scrounging around for a Con Ed bill.

09:00.162 --> 09:02.609
Cavella's address would
be on a Con Ed bill.

09:02.644 --> 09:04.373
What did your
investigation turn up?

09:04.408 --> 09:05.486
Well, not much.

09:05.521 --> 09:08.360
Somebody saw a car parked
across the street, that was about it.

09:08.395 --> 09:10.153
A car is something.

09:10.188 --> 09:13.372
Well, the plates traced to
Mr. And Mrs. McLeish in White Lake.

09:13.407 --> 09:15.045
They're a nice couple in their 60s.

09:15.080 --> 09:18.592
I don't figure they climbed that
eight-foot fence around those trash cans.

09:18.744 --> 09:22.002
Any history of anti-abortion activity?

09:22.037 --> 09:24.772
They chained themselves
to the door of the clinic last year.

09:24.807 --> 09:26.366
Got 12 months probation.

09:26.401 --> 09:30.485
Well, I'll bet that included a restraining
order to stay away from the clinic.

09:30.520 --> 09:31.934
Well, yes, it did.

09:31.969 --> 09:35.021
Sounds like they
violated their probation.

09:35.232 --> 09:37.074
Home Of Mr. &Mrs. Mcleish White
Lake, New York Wednesday, May 31

09:37.109 --> 09:39.576
Please! For the last time,
you don't have a choice here!

09:39.611 --> 09:41.206
You got to let us in.

09:47.637 --> 09:48.776
You ain't going to need those.

09:48.811 --> 09:51.080
You didn't see the
hole in Cavella's chest.

09:53.167 --> 09:55.273
Give us this day our daily bread.

09:55.308 --> 09:59.425
Forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

09:59.460 --> 10:02.400
Mr. And Mrs. McLeish, we have
a bench warrant for your arrest

10:02.435 --> 10:04.197
for violation of your probation.

10:04.232 --> 10:06.431
They're not going
anywhere without the radiator.

10:06.466 --> 10:08.182
The locks are laced through it.

10:08.217 --> 10:11.986
...forgive those who trespass
against us. / Hallowed be Thy name.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.041
Hey, Bobby.

10:17.233 --> 10:20.330
The neighbors say they had somebody
staying with them six weeks ago.

10:20.365 --> 10:24.086
Male, white, mid to late 30s,
brown hair, beard.

10:24.121 --> 10:26.095
They saw him driving their car.

10:26.130 --> 10:27.237
Damn.

10:27.272 --> 10:28.759
What's the problem?

10:28.794 --> 10:30.406
Blade's stuck.

10:30.890 --> 10:33.585
Somebody put steel
pipes around the locks,

10:33.620 --> 10:36.281
then stuck metal
rods inside the pipes,

10:36.316 --> 10:38.465
so my blades are just spinning.

10:39.082 --> 10:40.814
I got to change blades.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.483
You all better get comfortable.

10:44.174 --> 10:46.515
What'd they use when they
chained themselves to the clinic?

10:46.550 --> 10:50.460
Just a padlock and a bicycle chain.
We cut them loose in a minute flat.

10:54.957 --> 10:57.599
Nine hours to cut them out.
That's just great.

10:57.634 --> 11:00.206
We have a sketch of Ma and
Pa Kettle's houseguest.

11:00.241 --> 11:03.443
We tried one without the beard and
showed it to the Central Park witnesses.

11:03.478 --> 11:05.405
No definite hits, but it's close.

11:05.440 --> 11:06.583
Got him.

11:06.950 --> 11:10.551
The old couple didn't have the tools
or materials to make the locks.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.523
I figured the houseguest made them.

11:12.558 --> 11:16.445
I did a search for protesters
who blockaded abortion clinics

11:16.480 --> 11:18.362
by chaining themselves to the doors.

11:18.397 --> 11:21.857
The longer it takes to remove them,
the longer the clinics have to shut down.

11:23.957 --> 11:27.532
One guy got famous in Wisconsin

11:27.567 --> 11:31.239
for teaching people how to make
locks that took up to 12 hours to remove.

11:31.274 --> 11:35.660
He did it with steel pipes,
metal rods, abrasives...

11:35.810 --> 11:37.657
meet Dennis Griscom.

11:38.472 --> 11:41.153
From locks to lock 'n' load.

11:41.345 --> 11:44.212
Next stop for Mr. Griscom is lockup.

11:47.262 --> 11:49.519
Griscom has two convictions

11:49.554 --> 11:52.804
for anti-abortion activities
in Wisconsin and Florida.

11:52.839 --> 11:53.993
He served 60 days.

11:54.028 --> 11:55.868
He's been off the radar
the last four years.

11:55.903 --> 11:58.862
And there's fiber evidence.
A hair on the stick left at the scene

11:58.897 --> 12:01.650
matched a hair from
a blanket in the McLeish's house.

12:01.685 --> 12:03.003
A probable match,

12:03.038 --> 12:04.287
not conclusive.

12:04.322 --> 12:06.040
What's the old folks' involvement?

12:06.075 --> 12:08.671
They're being transported
here for questioning. We'll see.

12:08.706 --> 12:10.227
He's done with them.

12:10.262 --> 12:13.069
He'll seek support
from other zealots.

12:13.104 --> 12:17.329
He's a terrorist, with a profound
dedication to an over-valued idea,

12:17.364 --> 12:21.463
one that's his sole focus in life.

12:21.498 --> 12:23.401
Zealot, terrorist...

12:23.436 --> 12:25.269
loaded terms, Detective.

12:25.304 --> 12:28.835
I hope you're not suggesting
he represents a movement.

12:30.379 --> 12:35.779
Well, I'm suggesting he might
think he is and act accordingly.

12:38.857 --> 12:40.285
This is a murder case.

12:40.320 --> 12:44.674
Let's not turn into
a litmus test on abortion.

12:50.328 --> 12:52.670
Sounds like it already is.

12:55.243 --> 12:57.234
I couldn't sleep the night before.

12:57.269 --> 12:59.796
I felt like I had
a lead weight in my chest,

12:59.831 --> 13:01.983
and the closer I got
to doing it, the worse I felt.

13:02.018 --> 13:03.498
I didn't feel brave,

13:03.533 --> 13:04.826
I didn't feel full of fire.

13:04.861 --> 13:06.629
Providence spoke to you, Dennis.

13:06.664 --> 13:08.451
You had no choice.

13:08.486 --> 13:11.158
When I looked though that scope...

13:14.897 --> 13:18.279
it was like the Lord slipped
his hand inside mine,

13:18.573 --> 13:20.709
like a glove, you know?

13:20.744 --> 13:22.694
And put his finger
around the trigger.

13:22.729 --> 13:24.996
That's exactly what he did.

13:25.031 --> 13:27.264
He helped you save the babies.

13:27.541 --> 13:28.718
I just...

13:28.874 --> 13:31.883
I can't shake this
sadness I'm feeling.

13:31.918 --> 13:34.147
You're not alone in this.
People will help you.

13:34.182 --> 13:35.775
Okay?

13:37.975 --> 13:40.021
Here's $500.

13:43.477 --> 13:44.871
If you need any more,

13:44.906 --> 13:47.316
send a message.

13:47.351 --> 13:49.726
Thank you. / Hey.

13:49.761 --> 13:52.524
Thank you.

14:04.771 --> 14:07.489
We have witnesses who
saw him near the shooting,

14:07.524 --> 14:11.542
forensic evidence linking him to it.

14:13.716 --> 14:16.045
How can you protect him?

14:19.026 --> 14:21.777
I saw books in your home

14:21.812 --> 14:24.403
by Gandhi, Martin Luther King...

14:24.438 --> 14:27.918
apostles of non-violence.

14:27.953 --> 14:31.679
I know that you
follow in their footsteps.

14:32.577 --> 14:35.760
Conscientious objector in the '50s.

14:36.206 --> 14:39.107
Voter registration in the '60s.

14:39.142 --> 14:42.009
You marched against Vietnam,

14:43.159 --> 14:44.909
apartheid,

14:44.944 --> 14:46.625
abortion.

14:46.660 --> 14:49.435
Always by
non-violent means, right?

14:49.998 --> 14:51.555
Yes.

14:54.307 --> 14:56.314
I found these

14:56.349 --> 14:58.286
in your home.

14:58.321 --> 15:01.164
You and your wife
at candlelight vigils.

15:01.297 --> 15:04.226
You oppose the death penalty.

15:05.066 --> 15:06.658
Any kind of killing.

15:06.693 --> 15:10.224
I have a lot of respect for
that position, Mr. McLeish.

15:12.655 --> 15:18.585
There's no hypocrisy to it,
no double standard...

15:21.663 --> 15:25.366
even for doctors like Leo Cavella.

15:30.050 --> 15:32.619
Even for him, right?

15:42.809 --> 15:44.619
God forgive us.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.453
We didn't know
what he was planning.

15:47.576 --> 15:49.850
How'd you meet Griscom?

15:50.443 --> 15:54.184
At a movement conference
in Memphis last spring.

15:54.219 --> 15:57.926
There were old friends
from Operation Rescue,

15:57.961 --> 15:59.695
and some people we didn't know,

15:59.730 --> 16:02.537
radicals who said
the Lord wanted us

16:02.572 --> 16:04.306
to pick up the sword

16:04.341 --> 16:05.988
and kill more abortionists.

16:06.023 --> 16:08.269
Was Griscom
one of the radicals?

16:08.304 --> 16:09.254
No.

16:09.289 --> 16:12.149
He just listened.

16:12.350 --> 16:14.978
He never said
anything about Dr. Cavella,

16:15.013 --> 16:16.547
or buying a rifle.

16:16.582 --> 16:18.816
What did he do all day?
Did he have a job?

16:18.851 --> 16:19.802
No.

16:19.837 --> 16:21.780
He had savings, he said.

16:21.815 --> 16:24.486
Mostly, he helped
around the place.

16:24.875 --> 16:26.619
I took him bird watching.

16:26.917 --> 16:30.013
There's a bald eagle
preserve near Goshen.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.862
Even gave him an
old pair of binoculars.

16:32.921 --> 16:34.676
What kind?

16:34.711 --> 16:36.432
Zeiss.

16:36.562 --> 16:39.167
He was a serious young man,

16:39.494 --> 16:42.943
who didn't know what direction
he was supposed to go.

16:42.978 --> 16:44.939
How did he end up
staying with you?

16:44.988 --> 16:46.893
We invited him to visit.

16:46.928 --> 16:48.764
One day he showed up.

16:48.799 --> 16:53.490
Did he talk about any friends in the
movement, people who might help him?

16:53.525 --> 16:57.050
No. Only people he
talked about were his parents,

16:57.085 --> 16:59.142
his father mostly.

16:59.177 --> 17:00.930
And what did he say about him?

17:00.965 --> 17:03.691
Well, he told me
he was an engineer.

17:03.726 --> 17:06.416
He said his father
was proud of him.

17:07.973 --> 17:09.928
And that mattered to him?

17:09.963 --> 17:11.656
Sure.

17:11.691 --> 17:14.983
His father sounded like
a hard man to please.

17:17.468 --> 17:20.133
Any idea where
he stayed after he left?

17:20.167 --> 17:21.510
I think with family.

17:21.545 --> 17:22.818
What makes you say that?

17:22.853 --> 17:25.717
Before he left, he came
with me to the Wal-Mart

17:25.752 --> 17:27.426
to buy some gifts for his nieces.

17:27.462 --> 17:29.496
Is that who he said they were for?

17:29.531 --> 17:31.495
No, but he bought two key chains

17:31.530 --> 17:34.407
with kittens on them
and the initials "K" and "R,"

17:34.442 --> 17:36.557
so I assumed that's
who they were for.

17:39.256 --> 17:41.658
Home Of Mrs. Griscom Hackettstown,
New Jersey Friday, June 2

17:41.693 --> 17:43.791
Dennis doesn't have any nieces.

17:43.826 --> 17:47.859
He has a nephew...
my daughter's son, in Seattle.

17:47.894 --> 17:50.170
When was the last
time you talked to him?

17:50.205 --> 17:55.170
Maybe six months ago,
I'm not sure.

17:55.763 --> 17:59.209
I see your husband was
a marksman in Vietnam.

18:00.026 --> 18:02.611
Is this him hunting with Dennis?

18:02.646 --> 18:04.222
Yes.

18:05.365 --> 18:07.886
They look like they're
good pals. Are they?

18:09.364 --> 18:11.970
My husband died a year ago.

18:12.005 --> 18:14.542
Dennis looked up to him.

18:14.577 --> 18:18.664
He told people his
father was proud of him.

18:20.345 --> 18:22.098
When was this taken?

18:22.133 --> 18:23.851
Maybe last year.

18:26.610 --> 18:28.764
Zeiss binoculars.

18:31.814 --> 18:35.443
This was taken two months ago...

18:35.720 --> 18:39.456
in the area where
Dr. Cavella had his clinic.

18:40.010 --> 18:42.739
He didn't shoot that doctor.

18:43.384 --> 18:47.325
10 years ago he became
a missionary to help people.

18:48.572 --> 18:52.103
He couldn't hurt anyone.

18:52.347 --> 18:55.238
He won't be safe
unless he talks to us.

18:55.273 --> 18:56.727
Please,

18:56.762 --> 18:59.250
how did you get this picture?

19:09.658 --> 19:13.046
I found this on the
porch a month ago.

19:13.081 --> 19:16.420
It's just books and letters.

19:16.570 --> 19:17.525
Was there a note?

19:17.560 --> 19:23.634
No. He just left it on the porch,
he didn't even ring the doorbell.

19:23.811 --> 19:26.453
I found that picture inside.

19:26.488 --> 19:29.195
Did you recognize any of the
people in these other pictures?

19:29.230 --> 19:30.147
No.

19:30.182 --> 19:32.231
Do you know Lori Carlson? / No.

19:32.266 --> 19:34.245
This is addressed to Dennis.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.080
"Dear Dennis,
we hope this finds you well.

19:36.115 --> 19:38.975
Yesterday we took Katie and
Ruthie to the Botanical Gardens.

19:39.010 --> 19:41.836
They love going there and
witnessing the Lord's wonders.

19:41.871 --> 19:44.695
We all miss you.
Please call. " Signed,

19:44.730 --> 19:46.809
"Lori Carlson. "

19:46.970 --> 19:49.868
It's postmarked last
October in Brooklyn.

19:49.903 --> 19:51.008
K and R...

19:51.043 --> 19:53.303
Katie and Ruthie
Carlson in Brooklyn.

19:53.338 --> 19:55.072
It's a start.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.019
Lori Carlson? / Yes?

19:59.054 --> 20:00.746
This is a warrant allowing
us to search your house.

20:00.781 --> 20:02.438
- What's going on?
- Stay in here with your children.

20:02.473 --> 20:04.733
Two upstairs.
You two with me.

20:04.810 --> 20:06.691
Are there any adults
here besides yourself?

20:06.726 --> 20:08.387
No. Why are you here?

20:09.042 --> 20:11.709
We're looking for Dennis Griscom.

20:12.158 --> 20:13.288
Mrs. Carlson,

20:13.323 --> 20:15.591
we're conducting
a murder investigation.

20:15.626 --> 20:17.860
Now is not the time
to lie to the police.

20:19.709 --> 20:21.751
Dennis left four days ago.

20:21.786 --> 20:23.794
I don't know where he went.

20:23.922 --> 20:25.835
What room was he staying in?

20:25.870 --> 20:27.431
Down the stairs.

20:59.490 --> 21:01.810
Eames, I need a bag.

21:06.034 --> 21:08.424
Suspicious dust balls?

21:08.525 --> 21:09.808
It's spun glass.

21:09.843 --> 21:12.255
Commonly used
to make silencers.

21:12.290 --> 21:15.311
There was no attachment
for a silencer on the Remington.

21:15.673 --> 21:17.416
No. It's from a second rifle.

21:18.264 --> 21:19.918
He's not done yet.

21:24.246 --> 21:26.226
I don't know where
he was planning to go.

21:26.261 --> 21:27.709
He mention other doctors or clinics?

21:27.744 --> 21:29.894
No. He didn't talk
about things like that.

21:29.929 --> 21:32.044
I don't believe he did
the things you say.

21:32.079 --> 21:33.717
But if he did,

21:33.752 --> 21:35.860
then he must believe
he's doing God's will,

21:35.895 --> 21:37.968
and then it's up to
God to deal with him.

21:38.003 --> 21:40.051
Maybe God's too busy

21:40.086 --> 21:43.289
dealing with Leo
Cavella's five-year-old daughter.

21:43.324 --> 21:47.754
She was standing next to him
when your friend's bullet tore into him.

21:48.820 --> 21:52.427
I noticed there are no posters of pop
singers in your daughter's rooms,

21:52.462 --> 21:54.702
or pictures of athletes.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.612
We don't approve of that.

21:56.647 --> 21:58.489
Well, how about...

22:00.355 --> 22:02.095
soccer and tennis?

22:02.130 --> 22:03.347
I didn't see any equipment.

22:03.382 --> 22:08.380
We don't participate in those parts of
the culture that don't bring glory to God.

22:08.582 --> 22:09.882
Dennis,

22:09.917 --> 22:14.923
he dragged this abomination,
this execution into your living room.

22:16.159 --> 22:18.892
How can that bring glory to God?

22:21.222 --> 22:25.740
We have every reason to
believe he's going to kill again.

22:35.269 --> 22:36.989
Dennis...

22:38.920 --> 22:42.378
Dennis was on the computer a lot,

22:42.599 --> 22:46.706
talking to other people
when we weren't home.

22:49.018 --> 22:51.457
Please, don't hurt him.

22:57.184 --> 22:59.076
We found some
of Griscom's e-mails.

22:59.111 --> 23:01.358
Just their tracks.
The actual e-mails were long gone.

23:01.393 --> 23:04.949
Most of the e-mails around the time of the
shooting are to and from one address.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.065
Zach here thinks
he can chase it down.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.897
Zach here has chased him down.

23:08.932 --> 23:10.847
It's linked to a website.

23:12.256 --> 23:13.676
This is extreme.

23:13.711 --> 23:17.249
"Stop abortion on demand by
the most direct means possible. "

23:17.284 --> 23:18.967
Looks like Griscom found a friend.

23:19.002 --> 23:21.336
There's a PO box
address in Long Island.

23:21.371 --> 23:22.607
If we find this clown,

23:22.642 --> 23:25.512
any way we can monitor his e-mail
traffic in case Griscom contacts him?

23:25.547 --> 23:26.971
You can.

23:27.583 --> 23:30.970
If you install a spying
application on his computer.

23:31.871 --> 23:35.106
Home Of Lorne Cutler Bayside,
New York Friday, June 9

23:36.365 --> 23:38.104
You can look all you want,

23:38.139 --> 23:39.808
you won't find any guns here.

23:39.843 --> 23:42.445
Your website said,
"The most direct means possible. "

23:42.480 --> 23:45.401
Everyone knows
what that means, Mr. Cutler.

23:45.436 --> 23:48.058
It means whatever
you need it to mean.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.737
I'm just a truck driver.
I never threatened anybody.

23:50.772 --> 23:52.200
What about the Supreme Court?

23:52.235 --> 23:54.426
I wouldn't hurt a hair
on those gentlemen.

23:54.461 --> 23:56.937
But the two women on
the Court, they're fair game?

23:56.972 --> 23:58.373
Ma'am,

23:58.408 --> 24:00.549
God's never told
me to kill anybody.

24:00.584 --> 24:02.548
But if he did, I bet you would.

24:02.583 --> 24:04.682
I'd obey him,
just like Abraham did.

24:04.717 --> 24:06.745
I heard a threat to
a government official.

24:06.780 --> 24:07.678
The hell you did.

24:07.713 --> 24:09.800
I'm taking you in.
Turn around.

24:10.295 --> 24:11.742
This is bull.
You can't do this...

24:11.777 --> 24:12.886
Shut your mouth.

24:12.921 --> 24:15.472
Maybe you read only
the parts of the Bible you like,

24:15.507 --> 24:19.839
but what I remember from Sunday school
is God stopped Abraham from killing.

24:19.874 --> 24:22.496
I'll get downtown
started on the complaint.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.074
Let's step in here, Mr. Cutler.

24:28.621 --> 24:31.385
Hey, Harland, it's me, Eames,

24:31.420 --> 24:33.676
I need you to fill out
a complaint for me.

24:33.711 --> 24:35.842
Suspect's name is Lorne Cutler.

24:35.877 --> 24:37.974
You take orders from that lady?

24:38.009 --> 24:39.726
She's got seniority.

24:40.965 --> 24:43.407
You know these
women on the force,

24:43.442 --> 24:46.319
they come with
an extra set of brass ones.

24:47.460 --> 24:48.997
Is that better?

24:49.032 --> 24:50.534
Yes, thank you.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.860
The TPO is the suspect's
home at 428 Powell Street

24:53.895 --> 24:55.825
in Bayside, New York.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.778
Okay, I'll hold.

24:58.464 --> 25:02.346
You admire this man,
the one who shot the doctor?

25:02.381 --> 25:06.446
He killed to protect innocent life. He
heard God's command and he obeyed.

25:06.481 --> 25:09.215
Yeah, like Saint Joan,
and the Knights Templar.

25:10.971 --> 25:12.534
I read your website.

25:12.569 --> 25:14.165
I get it.

25:15.707 --> 25:17.995
The government

25:18.030 --> 25:20.112
is using these statutes and lawsuits

25:20.147 --> 25:24.274
by pro-abortion groups to
cut off all legitimate protest.

25:24.309 --> 25:28.704
So if you believe that the soul
enters a body at conception...

25:31.496 --> 25:34.155
you have to take the next step.

25:34.190 --> 25:36.922
Shutting down those killing fields...

25:37.309 --> 25:42.104
it's the only cause left
worth dying for, isn't it?

25:43.687 --> 25:46.642
There is no higher calling.

25:50.155 --> 25:53.189
I'm glad this person
skipped the state.

25:54.232 --> 25:56.368
I don't have to be
involved in his arrest.

25:58.898 --> 26:00.584
Where do you think he went?

26:01.182 --> 26:04.449
Let's just say he's not on
this side of the Mason-Dixon.

26:07.474 --> 26:10.529
We got to kick him. Downtown
won't sign off on the complaint.

26:12.652 --> 26:14.356
What did I tell you?

26:19.779 --> 26:21.337
Now Cutler is writing e-mails.

26:21.372 --> 26:24.500
"All it takes is for one state
to threaten sedition over abortion

26:24.535 --> 26:26.914
and this thing will turn around.
There's reason to hope.

26:26.949 --> 26:31.948
We have friends in surprising places...
even in the New York City police.

26:32.042 --> 26:34.473
I met a detective who
thinks picking up the sword

26:34.508 --> 26:38.417
is the only option left to
stop the abortion factories. "

26:40.039 --> 26:41.727
You told him that?

26:41.762 --> 26:42.996
To earn his confidence.

26:43.031 --> 26:45.576
Not to mention his love
and admiration.

26:45.611 --> 26:48.364
True believers expect
everyone to think like them.

26:54.048 --> 26:55.733
What do you really think?

26:55.768 --> 26:58.229
I'll tell you what I think
when I get pregnant.

26:58.264 --> 27:01.454
You're going to have to do
a lot better than that, Bobby.

27:03.972 --> 27:05.787
Okay.

27:10.645 --> 27:12.732
Life is full of uncertainty.

27:12.767 --> 27:14.819
People need to have options.

27:15.376 --> 27:18.782
Abortion has got to
be one of those options.

27:20.751 --> 27:22.117
That's what I think.

27:22.152 --> 27:24.675
He just got pulled
into a private chat.

27:29.292 --> 27:30.436
Okay. That's Griscom.

27:30.471 --> 27:33.087
I gave Cutler misinformation
about our investigation.

27:33.122 --> 27:34.271
Can you trace him?

27:35.427 --> 27:38.650
He's a guest on
somebody else's account.

27:38.685 --> 27:41.951
The account is registered
with Barbara's Place,

27:41.986 --> 27:43.594
it's a copy store chain.

27:47.495 --> 27:48.951
Susan!

27:52.389 --> 27:54.375
Dennis?

27:54.410 --> 27:55.608
What are you doing here?

27:55.643 --> 27:58.324
The alumni office told
me where you worked.

27:59.228 --> 28:00.482
Are you all right?

28:00.517 --> 28:01.701
How are your parents?

28:01.736 --> 28:03.788
Dad passed away last year.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.110
I'm so sorry.

28:06.642 --> 28:07.883
Your boyfriend?

28:07.918 --> 28:09.443
No.

28:10.031 --> 28:12.000
I'm engaged.

28:12.035 --> 28:14.300
I'm getting married
in a few months.

28:15.689 --> 28:17.715
You going to have kids?

28:19.961 --> 28:21.699
Maybe.

28:23.326 --> 28:25.988
I have something for you.

28:27.274 --> 28:29.295
Not exactly a wedding present.

28:31.020 --> 28:33.779
They were my Dad's
when he was in the army.

28:33.814 --> 28:35.925
He always liked you a lot.

28:38.981 --> 28:40.370
This is very sweet of you, Dennis.

28:40.405 --> 28:42.536
Have a good life, Susan.

28:47.651 --> 28:50.813
I was so angry, for so long.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.364
But I was angry
at the wrong person.

29:01.884 --> 29:04.151
Barbara's Place 158
Avenue B Thurseday, June 15

29:04.231 --> 29:07.957
Yeah, he's been in here
using the computers a few times.

29:07.992 --> 29:09.778
Last night, as a matter of fact.

29:09.813 --> 29:10.996
How did he pay?

29:11.031 --> 29:13.700
Cash. He never stays
on the computer long.

29:13.735 --> 29:15.166
What did he use for ID?

29:15.201 --> 29:16.949
This guy didn't have any ID.

29:16.984 --> 29:18.286
I think he's homeless.

29:18.321 --> 29:21.353
I let him leave a meal card
from Saint Mark's Mission.

29:41.382 --> 29:44.600
Buddy, if I were you,
I'd taste it first.

29:44.635 --> 29:46.451
Hey, ease off on him.

29:46.683 --> 29:48.601
There's plenty
to be grateful for, yeah?

29:48.636 --> 29:50.520
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Say grace, preacher.

29:50.555 --> 29:51.907
Go ahead.

29:52.058 --> 29:55.330
It wouldn't kill any of us
to have a little gratitude.

29:59.733 --> 30:01.330
Thank you, God,
for your bounty

30:01.365 --> 30:03.022
today and every day.

30:03.057 --> 30:05.117
Amen. / Amen.

30:10.079 --> 30:11.957
Easy!

30:12.223 --> 30:13.007
Our Father who art in Heaven,

30:13.042 --> 30:15.407
- All right. Stand up!
- hallowed be Thy name...

30:16.619 --> 30:18.352
You're going to have to carry him.

30:18.969 --> 30:20.877
Give us this day our daily bread,

30:20.912 --> 30:22.751
and forgive us our trespasses,

30:22.786 --> 30:25.720
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

30:28.651 --> 30:31.046
We have you pegged
every inch of the way, Dennis.

30:31.081 --> 30:32.534
Where you bought the rifle,

30:32.569 --> 30:33.953
how you got his address,

30:33.988 --> 30:36.113
where you stayed in Brooklyn.

30:36.148 --> 30:39.305
The state's got you
for second-degree murder.

30:41.305 --> 30:43.601
That's 25 years to life.

30:43.636 --> 30:45.356
But the Feds
also have jurisdiction.

30:45.391 --> 30:47.119
That's the death penalty.

30:47.154 --> 30:50.254
You don't show some cooperation, we
are going to let them throw you the party.

30:52.600 --> 30:56.011
Let's talk about the second rifle,
the one you made your silencer for.

30:56.046 --> 30:59.195
You stashed it,
buried it, whatever.

30:59.230 --> 31:01.711
We need to find it
before someone else does.

31:01.746 --> 31:04.482
You don't want some poor
kid to get shot, do you?

31:04.517 --> 31:06.194
It won't be incriminating.

31:06.229 --> 31:08.359
You can say you were
throwing it away,

31:08.394 --> 31:10.568
or you saw somebody put it there.

31:10.603 --> 31:13.500
But you don't tell us,
and God forbid something happens,

31:13.535 --> 31:15.725
you think the big guy's
going to forgive you?

31:15.760 --> 31:17.532
The big guy?

31:18.004 --> 31:19.958
You trivialize him.

31:19.993 --> 31:24.473
You pretend to know
what He will or will not forgive.

31:26.169 --> 31:28.459
I'm a soldier in the Lord's army.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.744
My conscience is clear.

31:31.392 --> 31:34.816
And you, you have a duty
to protect innocent life.

31:34.851 --> 31:38.240
So you're going to do the
right thing now, aren't you?

31:40.013 --> 31:42.703
You're going to open that door
and let me walk out of here.

32:00.635 --> 32:02.992
In five, 10, maybe 15 years,

32:03.027 --> 32:05.701
people like whoever
killed this Dr. Cavella,

32:05.736 --> 32:08.376
they're going to be
heroes in this country.

32:09.168 --> 32:10.601
What do we have on him?

32:10.636 --> 32:11.999
Hindering prosecution.

32:12.034 --> 32:14.390
Nothing that implicates
him in a conspiracy.

32:14.425 --> 32:15.525
And Griscom?

32:15.560 --> 32:19.647
The best evidence we have against him
is still the hair we found at the scene.

32:19.682 --> 32:21.139
A single hair?

32:21.174 --> 32:24.126
We have 48 hours to
bring him up for arraignment.

32:24.161 --> 32:27.687
With what we have now,
I might not be able to hold him.

32:27.852 --> 32:29.464
What's he doing?

32:29.499 --> 32:31.076
He's praying.

32:33.254 --> 32:35.743
Speaking of litmus tests,

32:35.778 --> 32:37.684
assuming we get the goods on him,

32:37.719 --> 32:41.047
how do you try him without
having it turn into a three-ring circus?

32:41.082 --> 32:44.423
By inoculating the jury
against Griscom's defense.

32:44.458 --> 32:47.146
He's going to claim he killed
to protect unborn children.

32:47.181 --> 32:49.366
Inoculate them, how?

32:49.401 --> 32:52.774
By telling the jury you agree
with Griscom on abortion?

32:53.541 --> 32:55.658
It crossed my mind.

32:55.693 --> 32:59.811
You really believe
abortion is murder?

33:01.080 --> 33:02.306
Like I said,

33:02.341 --> 33:04.307
long as you bring
me the evidence,

33:04.342 --> 33:05.856
convicting this...

33:05.891 --> 33:07.863
gentleman shouldn't be a problem.

33:14.304 --> 33:17.422
Promise me a margarita
when this is all over.

33:18.929 --> 33:21.349
The copying place
sent over a list of websites

33:21.384 --> 33:23.659
Griscom visited on their computer.

33:23.694 --> 33:25.555
Look at this one.

33:25.628 --> 33:29.108
Hudson University
Alumni Association.

33:31.412 --> 33:33.256
Levy & Brown Investments 312
Platt Street Monday, June 19

33:33.291 --> 33:35.659
The Association said
he looked you up.

33:35.694 --> 33:37.605
When did you last talk to him?

33:38.590 --> 33:40.274
Three days ago.

33:40.309 --> 33:43.510
I was on my way out to lunch
and he just walked up to me.

33:43.665 --> 33:44.798
What did he want?

33:44.833 --> 33:47.661
He had something
for me, from his father.

33:47.696 --> 33:49.083
He died last year.

33:49.118 --> 33:50.792
What was it?

33:55.743 --> 33:57.978
I don't know why
Dennis thought I'd want them.

33:58.013 --> 34:01.059
I was never
particularly fond of his dad.

34:01.094 --> 34:03.300
He was really hard on Dennis.

34:03.335 --> 34:06.319
How long had it been
since you talked to him?

34:06.595 --> 34:08.583
Almost 10 years.

34:08.619 --> 34:11.411
What happened
between the two of you?

34:13.853 --> 34:17.839
Something was eating
away at him all these years.

34:18.001 --> 34:20.110
These mementos
were precious to him,

34:20.145 --> 34:22.435
but he gave them to you. Why?

34:26.420 --> 34:30.018
Dennis had this idea that
we were going to get married

34:30.054 --> 34:33.304
and help the poor
and have a lot of kids.

34:33.373 --> 34:36.074
I respected those
goals and I loved him,

34:36.110 --> 34:39.467
but I had another life in mind

34:39.902 --> 34:41.822
and then I got pregnant.

34:42.987 --> 34:44.873
Dennis was so happy

34:44.909 --> 34:48.176
and I thought it was the worst thing
that could've happened to me.

34:49.389 --> 34:52.712
So I started talking
about having an abortion.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.690
Dennis went crazy.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.848
Yeah. He ordered me not to do it.

35:02.665 --> 35:06.648
He put pictures of aborted
fetuses all around our apartment.

35:06.683 --> 35:08.848
Told me I'd be
murdering his child,

35:08.883 --> 35:13.282
as if what was inside me was
more important to him than I was.

35:13.317 --> 35:15.951
So that's when
I made up my mind.

35:16.037 --> 35:19.640
I waited until he went to work,
I packed up and left.

35:20.085 --> 35:23.567
I went to the clinic and
I never saw Dennis again.

35:28.155 --> 35:29.707
I've got to put him in
front of a judge in an hour.

35:29.742 --> 35:33.478
You've got less time than that to
get some kind of admission out of him.

35:33.796 --> 35:36.004
My client has a date
in arraignment court.

35:36.039 --> 35:38.502
There are a few things we
need to clear up with him first.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.080
He's invoking his right to be silent.

35:40.115 --> 35:44.237
He doesn't have a right to be deaf, so
he'll have to listen to what we have to say.

35:47.266 --> 35:48.722
First thing,

35:48.757 --> 35:51.512
there's nothing in
your file about children.

35:51.547 --> 35:53.081
Do you have any kids?

35:56.390 --> 35:59.712
No. I took a vow of celibacy.

35:59.747 --> 36:02.403
You never wanted any kids?
You don't like them?

36:03.162 --> 36:04.632
I love kids.

36:05.294 --> 36:07.523
But that's not what
God had planned for me.

36:08.110 --> 36:11.141
You think you would've
been a good parent?

36:12.245 --> 36:13.896
Better than your father?

36:17.133 --> 36:19.293
There's nothing wrong with
the way my father brought me up.

36:19.328 --> 36:22.006
He thought there was
a lot wrong with you, didn't he?

36:22.041 --> 36:23.479
My dad was proud of me.

36:23.514 --> 36:26.497
Is that why you became...
what is it you called yourself?

36:26.532 --> 36:29.388
"A soldier in the Lord's army"?

36:30.319 --> 36:32.827
To prove to him that
you had the discipline,

36:32.862 --> 36:36.614
or the commitment,
the will to sacrifice yourself

36:36.649 --> 36:38.613
for a greater cause,

36:38.648 --> 36:40.578
like he did in Vietnam?

36:45.084 --> 36:47.054
Well, it was just a thought.

36:50.680 --> 36:52.478
Maybe you were...

36:53.411 --> 36:56.365
one of those
special people who heard...

36:56.400 --> 36:58.656
heard the voice of God tell them...

36:58.691 --> 37:00.912
to join the movement, is that it?

37:02.040 --> 37:03.961
Yes.

37:07.749 --> 37:10.077
It was divine guidance...

37:15.246 --> 37:18.484
not some base human passion,

37:18.519 --> 37:20.655
like anger...

37:20.690 --> 37:22.792
or revenge.

37:23.873 --> 37:25.801
Pride.

37:30.522 --> 37:32.257
It was wounded pride,

37:32.292 --> 37:33.816
wasn't it, Dennis?

37:33.851 --> 37:35.306
She defied you,

37:35.341 --> 37:38.557
she killed your unborn
child and it broke you.

37:38.592 --> 37:39.590
She was weak.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.232
It's not her fault. / Who then?

37:41.267 --> 37:43.642
Nobody held a gun
to her head to go to a clinic...

37:43.677 --> 37:45.140
It's the ones who allowed it!

37:45.175 --> 37:47.496
It's the ones who kept
my baby from being saved!

37:47.531 --> 37:49.818
What is it you told her?
That you were angry

37:49.853 --> 37:52.871
at the wrong person
all of these years!

37:53.024 --> 37:55.071
It was the doctors!

37:55.106 --> 37:57.427
They ripped that
life out of her body.

37:57.462 --> 38:00.239
Is that what you were thinking
when you had Cavella in your scope?

38:00.274 --> 38:01.345
Your baby?

38:01.380 --> 38:04.855
The life that might've
been your life with Susan?

38:04.890 --> 38:08.967
I don't think about that anymore.

38:09.002 --> 38:13.044
You think about it all the time.

38:13.079 --> 38:16.043
You've given up hope.

38:16.201 --> 38:18.649
You're giving everything away,

38:21.497 --> 38:24.576
touching base with old friends.

38:25.516 --> 38:27.662
You're closing the book.

38:29.226 --> 38:31.861
You're going to kill yourself.

38:32.180 --> 38:35.142
But not before you pay them back.

38:35.177 --> 38:36.742
Murderers like Cavella.

38:36.777 --> 38:38.647
All right, stop this! I'm telling you,
we are through here...

38:38.682 --> 38:41.442
Pay them back for what
they took away from you!

38:41.477 --> 38:42.722
He is going to arraignment court!

38:42.757 --> 38:45.900
Pay them back the
way your dad taught you!

38:45.935 --> 38:48.072
Come on, Dennis, say it!

38:50.265 --> 38:53.222
You took a life for a life.

39:16.736 --> 39:19.818
His mother put up her
house as bond for the bail.

39:19.853 --> 39:22.042
Soon as the paperwork's done,
he'll be out of our hands.

39:22.077 --> 39:25.632
We'll put surveillance on him and
we'll call Intel to alert the abortion clinics.

39:25.667 --> 39:28.145
I'm thinking he's planning
something closer to home.

39:28.180 --> 39:29.170
Girlfriend?

39:29.205 --> 39:31.817
The doctor who
performed the abortion.

39:51.225 --> 39:53.937
The surveillance team
followed him to his lawyer's office.

39:53.972 --> 39:55.817
They waited until the
lawyer went home for the night.

39:55.852 --> 39:58.116
They never saw
Griscom leave the building.

39:58.151 --> 40:00.380
Maybe he slipped
out through the garage.

40:00.415 --> 40:01.554
Terrific.

40:07.088 --> 40:09.682
The doctor who did the
abortion passed away two years ago.

40:09.717 --> 40:12.242
I put a trace out on everyone
else involved in the procedure.

40:12.277 --> 40:15.139
This guy has a death wish and he's
going to take somebody down with him.

40:15.174 --> 40:20.072
We can hope he gets the order
mixed up and shoots himself first.

40:23.697 --> 40:26.019
I need to run Griscom's
name through Westlaw.

40:26.054 --> 40:27.152
Go ahead.

40:30.562 --> 40:32.099
What're you looking for?

40:32.943 --> 40:36.209
He said it's the
ones who allowed it,

40:36.510 --> 40:39.816
the ones who kept
his baby from being saved.

40:41.877 --> 40:46.506
Here we go. "Dennis Griscom
in Re An Unborn Child. "

40:46.610 --> 40:50.504
He sued on behalf of his unborn kid to
stop Susan Ward from having the abortion.

40:50.539 --> 40:51.768
The judge turned him down.

40:51.803 --> 40:53.464
Judge Adam Yates.

40:53.569 --> 40:55.536
You find him, you find the gun.

40:57.717 --> 40:59.844
How you doing, Judge?
Good to see you.

41:54.717 --> 41:56.262
Might help if you had a firing pin.

41:56.297 --> 41:58.295
Drop the gun, Dennis!

42:01.511 --> 42:03.762
- Stay away from me.
- Get off the ledge, Dennis.

42:03.797 --> 42:05.080
Don't come near me!

42:05.194 --> 42:07.013
Why do you want
to hurt yourself?

42:08.395 --> 42:10.046
- Just tell me why.
- I don't answer to you!

42:10.081 --> 42:11.520
I know.

42:11.627 --> 42:14.357
What about your mother,
and Lori and her kids?

42:14.392 --> 42:16.255
They're going to want to know.

42:29.861 --> 42:32.670
It looks like it's
going to rain tonight.

42:33.070 --> 42:35.783
What? / Yeah.

42:35.915 --> 42:38.123
It looks like we're going
to get a good soaking.

42:38.158 --> 42:39.928
What do you think?

42:41.417 --> 42:42.661
I don't know.

42:42.696 --> 42:45.610
I saw some lighting

42:45.645 --> 42:48.318
from over the park.

42:48.353 --> 42:50.992
Can you see anything?

42:58.803 --> 43:01.242
Come on, Dennis,
let's go inside.

43:10.407 --> 43:11.657
Cuff him. / Grab him.

43:11.692 --> 43:13.066
I got him.

43:14.241 --> 43:15.525
Let's go. All right, get him up.

43:18.818 --> 43:20.665
Tell the judge we're all clear.

43:23.619 --> 43:25.642
Until the next one.
