03:37.092 --> 03:38.717

others of us came here

04:53.201 --> 04:54.776

are working hard

05:02.194 --> 05:03.242
'cause we're the White Swan,

05:03.395 --> 05:05.545
and others of us came here
to be haters

05:05.714 --> 05:07.288

05:07.382 --> 05:09.290
I'm sorry. Can you--can you
say that again for me?

05:09.310 --> 05:11.143

to be that girl...

that they were divorced.

06:53.062 --> 06:55.062
Yeah, they were...

06:55.082 --> 06:56.397
they were in the middle
of all that when it happened.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.750
My dad would never even see her
when she was in hospice.

06:59.327 --> 07:00.902

to tell any of you this.

07:00.996 --> 07:02.421
No, you don't.
We got everything we need.

07:02.572 --> 07:03.480

Justin's dad.

07:08.912 --> 07:09.836
Okay.

07:09.988 --> 07:10.837
And I need a Detroit Lions hat.

07:10.989 --> 07:12.822
I'll get us both one.

-Not in this house.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.677
That was invasive. Seriously.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.271
I've had friendlier mammograms.

but what I didn't tell you

08:59.114 --> 09:01.114
is that I also had
a double mastectomy.

09:01.266 --> 09:03.858
And then I got breast implants.

09:04.527 --> 09:06.711

tell you is that, um,

your boobs can't hear you?

-(snickers)
-I'm so fascinated.

16:00.735 --> 16:02.018
Hey, sorry about my sister.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.127
After our parents got divorced,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.946
she started a rumor
that our dad was a werewolf.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.206
He almost lost his job.

16:07.283 --> 16:09.467
Though, to be fair,
he did used to get drunk

16:09.618 --> 16:10.376
and howl at the moon.

16:10.528 --> 16:13.805
Anyway, she's, uh, the worst.

16:14.032 --> 16:16.140
Mm, Justin.
You look nice.

16:16.292 --> 16:18.217
Thank you.
You as well.

16:18.369 --> 16:19.143
I know.

16:19.220 --> 16:21.387
Which, uh, mood is this?

16:21.481 --> 16:22.814
Slay.

16:22.965 --> 16:26.726
The default is always slay.

16:26.878 --> 16:28.135
Yeah. Good.

16:29.047 --> 16:32.231
I'm sure she's too busy getting
focused to talk to me, David.

16:32.383 --> 16:34.233
-(laughs)
-Oh, don't be silly.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.327
Yulia specifically said
she was excited to say hello.

16:36.479 --> 16:37.745
She did?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.498
Monica.

16:40.725 --> 16:43.150
Yulia, hi!
Congratulations.

16:43.244 --> 16:44.577

16:44.729 --> 16:46.838
I want you to know that you
inspire me every night.

16:46.989 --> 16:49.248
Well, that's very kind
of you to say.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.416
When Rothbart puts
a curse on me

16:50.659 --> 16:53.753
and I need to feel terrified
and full of despair,

16:53.996 --> 16:55.755
I just remember all
the horrible things

16:55.923 --> 16:57.740
you used to say to me
at rehearsal.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.091
Well, the pressure got
to us all

16:59.185 --> 17:00.501
from time to time.

17:00.595 --> 17:03.095
Mm, it was mostly you.

17:03.248 --> 17:04.580
But things happen
for a reason, I guess.

17:04.599 --> 17:05.931

about my boobs.

It's not like they were really
that great to begin with,

18:27.774 --> 18:29.165
but then once they were gone,

appreciating them.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.444
They tattoo the nipples on.

I didn't know that.
Did you?

18:35.173 --> 18:36.856

18:37.008 --> 18:38.007
do a heart and a club,

didn't get it.

an eyeful yet?

normal-looking American rack.

18:55.860 --> 18:58.210
The left one's a little wonky,
like a lazy eye.

Imperfections are what
