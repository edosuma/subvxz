00:02.567 --> 00:03.100
- Previously on

00:03.100 --> 00:03.467
- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:04.567 --> 00:06.600
- Miami, baby.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.367
- Aah!

00:10.400 --> 00:12.233
- This is going
in my front yard.

00:12.266 --> 00:14.133
- This has been
the best bachelorette ever.

00:15.533 --> 00:17.500
- So Pride's a week away.

00:17.533 --> 00:20.300
- We're thinking of having James
potentially DJ on Friday.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.633
- He cannot have one drink.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.433
- Well, he hasn't been
drinking lately.

00:23.467 --> 00:26.133
- I'm not sure the kind of
evidence supports that.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.533
- You're officially unblocked.

00:27.567 --> 00:29.600
You an Insta-stalk me
whenever you want.

00:29.633 --> 00:31.567
- It's not about Insta-stalking.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.166
- Well,
I'm gonna Insta-stalk you

00:33.200 --> 00:35.300
to see if you're posting
some bullsh--.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.633
- Oh! Touché, touché.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.500
- When we first moved
into the house,

00:39.533 --> 00:41.367
I swear there were, like,
three or four days

00:41.400 --> 00:44.600
where I think I only got
out of bed to, like, pee.

00:44.633 --> 00:47.200
- Are you depressed?
Is that how you're feeling?

00:47.233 --> 00:49.600
- I have been
for a very long time.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.400
- But you can do it.
You've got this.

00:51.433 --> 00:53.133
You can rise to the challenge.

00:53.166 --> 00:55.066
- Max and I are
very good friends.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.433
- Yeah.
- Had a thing last year.

00:56.467 --> 00:58.200
- I don't wanna rub anything
in your face

00:58.233 --> 01:00.066
or make you feel any kind
of way--

01:00.100 --> 01:02.300
- Date him. Bang him.
You do you. Do him.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.567
And when you're done,
can you dust the shelves

01:03.600 --> 01:05.033
that the candles are on, please?
- Yeah.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.233
- Thanks.
- Sure.

This sh--'s out of control.

01:46.567 --> 01:48.100
Do these smell at all?

01:48.133 --> 01:48.700
No.
- Mm.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.567
- Really?

01:50.600 --> 01:53.633
There's nothing that'll
snap you back to reality faster

01:53.667 --> 01:56.200
than 5-day-old B.O. from Miami.

01:57.567 --> 01:59.166
I'm just gonna wash all this.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.100

02:02.133 --> 02:03.467
- Hello?
- Hey.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.467

02:06.500 --> 02:08.133

02:08.166 --> 02:09.300

02:09.333 --> 02:10.500
Oh, sh--,
are those the suits?

02:10.533 --> 02:12.100
- Yeah.
- I grabbed, um,

02:12.133 --> 02:13.567
white and black t-shirts
to go underneath.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.600
I think white will look better.
What do you think?

02:15.633 --> 02:18.600
- Yeah.
- What?

02:18.633 --> 02:20.734
- Oh, my God.
Those are ----ing amazing.

02:20.767 --> 02:22.533
- Look at the shoulders.
Oh, my God.

02:22.567 --> 02:26.200
- Whoo! Those are hot.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.100
I love those so much.

super styling baby ♪

02:30.500 --> 02:33.567

02:35.233 --> 02:37.400
- Yeah, Bubba.

02:37.433 --> 02:39.467
- Dude, your Pride's showing.
- Hell, yeah.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.266
- Hell, yeah.
- I like it.

02:42.300 --> 02:45.266
- Coming back right into Pride
is not easy on the old body,

02:45.300 --> 02:46.400
but--
- No, it's not.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.734
- Dude.
- Dude.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.734
- Is James locked down or...
- Yes. I'm not--

02:49.767 --> 02:51.633
- I'm not gonna babysit him,
but, like--

02:51.667 --> 02:53.333
- No, of course. I mean, dude,
we're gonna be busy, so...

02:53.367 --> 02:55.500
- Just remember what happened
last Pride.

02:55.533 --> 02:57.467
If TomTom was my bar,

02:57.500 --> 02:59.533
he sure as sh--
would not be DJing at it.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.200
- No, she shouldn't be wearing
those shorts.

03:01.233 --> 03:03.367
They're not very flattering.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.567
Lose some ----ing weight.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.233
I'm all for equality, but that
whore can go herself.

03:09.266 --> 03:13.433
- James is lucky that my husband
is, like, a really nice guy.

03:14.633 --> 03:16.433
- After he's off the clock,

03:16.467 --> 03:18.300
he wants to go drink
or something like that,

03:18.333 --> 03:20.400
but get him in there early
and get him out early.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.166
- Before he gets hos--

03:22.200 --> 03:23.600
- I don't wanna bring him on
at 6 p.m. and--

03:23.633 --> 03:26.600
- By then he will be drunk.
- Yeah, for sure.

03:26.633 --> 03:31.333
Even though I worry about James
being a lot of headache,

03:31.367 --> 03:33.266
not only does James have
a built-in following,

03:33.300 --> 03:36.000
but when he's on,
he just brings this energy.

03:36.033 --> 03:38.266
He gets everybody dancing
and partying,

03:38.300 --> 03:40.667
and people buy more drinks.

03:40.700 --> 03:42.467
One, two, three.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.400
- All: TomTom!
- TomTom.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.433
- Now I'm gonna feel like
an idiot,

03:55.467 --> 03:58.166
walking along
with this slipper on.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.533
And it's broken.
We're going with the story

04:00.567 --> 04:02.533
that I broke it kicking
Ken's ass, okay?

04:02.567 --> 04:07.000
Not I stubbed my toe.
I don't wanna look like a pussy.

04:07.033 --> 04:09.567
You haven't met Brett.
He's been training me.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.200
so maybe he can carry me
the whole day.

04:13.233 --> 04:16.300
He's super cute. Everybody's,
like, drooling over him.

04:16.333 --> 04:17.433
Scheana's like this.

04:17.467 --> 04:19.033
Like a dog on heat.

04:19.066 --> 04:22.433
- I feel like I haven't been
here in forever.

04:24.333 --> 04:25.367
Hey!

04:27.333 --> 04:29.667
- Oh...my God.
- Look at the swans!

04:29.700 --> 04:31.734
- So cute.

04:31.767 --> 04:34.700
- Hi!
- Hi!

04:34.734 --> 04:36.567
- Hello!

04:36.600 --> 04:38.500
- So we're gonna make
some posters for Pride today.

04:38.533 --> 04:41.600
It's a crazy day. It's like
the biggest celebration.

04:41.633 --> 04:43.633
It's very avant-garde.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.734
We get people that can act
a little crazy,

04:45.767 --> 04:49.033
get a little drunk--
not just your boyfriend.

04:52.333 --> 04:56.266
- Some people don't understand
how well James has been doing,

04:56.300 --> 04:58.633
and I feel like
there's always this cloud

04:58.667 --> 05:04.400
that hovers over him of people
not letting his past go.

05:04.433 --> 05:07.533
- Okay, you guys go outside.
Let's take the thing.

05:07.567 --> 05:10.533
Ariana's coming by in a minute.
- Is Dayna coming?

05:10.567 --> 05:13.266
- Why are you pulling that face?
"Is Dayna coming?"

05:13.300 --> 05:14.533
Like, "Is Dayna coming?"
- No, I'm--I'm saying I don't--

05:14.567 --> 05:16.567
No, I'm just saying
I don't know.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.467
I'm counting people,
and I don't--

05:18.500 --> 05:19.700
- No, it was like this.
It was like, "Is Dayna coming?"

05:19.734 --> 05:21.400
- No, like,
it's 'cause I don't know.

05:21.433 --> 05:23.033
'Cause I don't have
her phone number,

05:23.066 --> 05:24.367
and I haven't talked to her.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.467
- I want you to be nice
to Dayna.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.367
She doesn't feel as included.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.734
- I think here,
there's been some challenges

05:30.000 --> 05:32.266
of people who don't seem
like they want me here.

05:32.300 --> 05:33.767
- Who are we talking about,
exactly?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.500
- I don't think Scheana's
been very kind to me.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.433
- Has this got something to do
with Max?

05:37.467 --> 05:38.600
- No, and that's what
I keep saying.

05:38.633 --> 05:40.567
- Because, okay, 'cause she's

05:40.600 --> 05:42.433
kind of dating Max,
and you are--

05:42.467 --> 05:44.500
- Of cour--They're not dating.
They're hooking up.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.767
- Yeah, but is there a little
jealousy thing going now?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.500
- No, and that's what I've--
- Because you were with Max

05:48.533 --> 05:49.767
for a while, weren't you?
- Yeah, last year.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.633
Now Max and I are
really good friends.

05:51.667 --> 05:55.500
- Enough said. I know exactly
what "good friends" mean.

05:55.533 --> 05:58.500
- He's my best friend.
He's my best friend.

05:58.533 --> 06:01.266
He's my best friend,
and we do everything together.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.633
He's my best friend,

06:02.667 --> 06:05.500
and, like, I can't lose
another best friend.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.667
- I'm gonna do you a favor.
I'm gonna shag your socks off,

06:07.700 --> 06:09.367
because you are
a good ----ing friend.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.033
How about that?

06:11.066 --> 06:13.333
When you're in the workspace,
yeah, be supportive, be--

06:13.367 --> 06:15.400
- I have been.

06:15.433 --> 06:17.667
We talked about Max, and I
gave her some advice, and--

06:17.700 --> 06:19.700
- You gave her advice on Max?

06:19.734 --> 06:21.100
- Yeah, I just said,
"Woman to woman,

06:21.133 --> 06:22.467
just be careful."
- Be careful?

06:22.500 --> 06:24.333
- "Like, guard your heart."

06:24.367 --> 06:27.600
Guard your heart and...
vagina.

06:27.633 --> 06:29.400
- Is there a little bit
of jealousy there?

06:29.433 --> 06:32.000
- Oh, my God, Lisa, I'm not
jealous of Dayna, please.

06:32.033 --> 06:34.533
This is not
a Max jealousy thing.

06:34.567 --> 06:37.600
I simply just don't vibe
with the girl.

06:37.633 --> 06:39.533
There's no jealousy.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.667
I'm not the only person
who feels this way.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.533
It is not a jealousy thing.

06:42.567 --> 06:44.066
I'm sick of people thinking
it's a Max jealousy thing.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.734
She comes in this group
for two seconds,

06:45.767 --> 06:47.567
and it's like--it's frustrating.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.400
And I'm
sick of everyone trying to

06:49.433 --> 06:51.133
make it like it's a jealousy
thing 'cause it's not.

06:51.166 --> 06:52.500
- Okay.

06:52.533 --> 06:55.133
- Clearly I am not jealous
of Dayna.

06:55.166 --> 06:57.734
- Drop the competitive stuff
and get to know her,

06:57.767 --> 07:00.433
because I actually think you'd
both be really good friends.

07:00.467 --> 07:03.133
- I have enough friends,
but okay.

07:03.166 --> 07:06.567
I'm gonna go make posters.
I'm frustrated.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.533
I'm so ----ing over
this sh--.

07:08.567 --> 07:10.166
- What's the matter?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.033
- No, it's just stop saying
I'm ----ing jealous

07:12.066 --> 07:13.400
of someone I'm not jealous of.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.767
You felt the same way
about her.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.633
You didn't get a good read
on her right away.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.433
- I didn't. No, I didn't.
- And you still are kind of...

07:18.467 --> 07:19.700
- I'm iffy, just like you are.

07:19.734 --> 07:21.367
- Yeah, but that's what
I'm saying.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.700
- I mean, we just don't know her
well enough.

07:24.734 --> 07:26.734
- Are you still planning
on coming

07:26.767 --> 07:28.700
to my hairstylist
tomorrow morning?

07:28.734 --> 07:32.100
- Yeah.
- Because I invited Dayna,

07:32.133 --> 07:35.066
and I know you guys
have some beef, but, like--

07:35.100 --> 07:37.166
- I mean, it's not beef.
It's just, I mean,

07:37.200 --> 07:39.000
I'm not gonna go and, like,
be waiting in line behind Dayna

07:39.033 --> 07:40.600
to get my ----ing hair done.

07:40.633 --> 07:42.700
Everyone that's pushing her
on me pushes me away

07:42.734 --> 07:45.033
from wanting to get to know her.

07:45.066 --> 07:48.600
Because I'm a person where
I will make my own decisions

07:48.633 --> 07:50.400
at my own time
when it's right for me.

07:50.433 --> 07:52.166
- Yeah.
- And the more you push me to it

07:52.200 --> 07:53.667
the more it pushes me away,
the more it makes me wanna be,

07:53.700 --> 07:55.133
like, mm, actually,
I don't give a .

07:55.166 --> 07:57.000
- You need to...put behind
your words

07:57.033 --> 08:00.033
the same actions, and people
will start believing that.

08:00.066 --> 08:01.667
It's when that doesn't happen

08:01.700 --> 08:03.467
that people completely try to
tell you how to feel.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.734
- Okay, then I will force myself
to be friends with her

08:05.767 --> 08:07.700
so everyone shuts the
up. How about that?

08:11.433 --> 08:12.600
- Coming up...

08:12.633 --> 08:14.066
- How are you down a bartender?

08:14.100 --> 08:15.767
It's the biggest day
of bar history.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.100
- Can you help them set up,
please?

08:17.133 --> 08:19.700
- No, I don't do that.

08:19.734 --> 08:21.533
I think the best way to do this
is to just be drunk

08:21.567 --> 08:24.166
the whole time.
- The whole time.

08:41.567 --> 08:46.233
- Oh...my God.
If that swan attacks me...

08:46.266 --> 08:49.500
Oh, my God. Don't even
----ing try it, buddy.

08:49.533 --> 08:51.667
Hello?
- Hey.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.200
- Hi.
- Hi, darling. Come in.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.700
You look way nicer than I do.

08:55.734 --> 08:57.266
I'm gonna make a cup of tea.
- Distraction.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.033
- Because it--
- I would love a cup of tea.

08:59.066 --> 09:01.266
- Okay, good.
- Oh, Scheana's here.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.100
Oh, my gosh.
- I'm sure they're not making

09:03.133 --> 09:05.633
their posters,
and they're just gossiping.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.300
- If she's as cool
as everyone says she is,

09:07.333 --> 09:09.100
and she's so ----ing awesome,

09:09.133 --> 09:11.600
I will see that for myself,
but I don't right now.

09:13.066 --> 09:14.667
- I've been worried

09:14.700 --> 09:17.500
about you, actually,
since we spoke.

09:17.533 --> 09:20.467
- I wanted to just chat
with you a little bit.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.533
- Are you still depressed?
- Yeah. I kinda just wanted

09:23.567 --> 09:25.100
to talk to you a little bit more
about that.

09:25.133 --> 09:27.200
- Yeah. Just come by.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.600
Having been through such
chronic depression myself...

09:30.633 --> 09:32.066
- Mm-hmm.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.166
- But mine was more
circumstantial.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.000
You know, because losing
my brother, I just...

09:37.033 --> 09:40.700
- Your brother.
- ...didn't do well at all.

09:40.734 --> 09:45.200
I was such a mess. I was trying
to hold everything together,

09:45.233 --> 09:48.100
and I-I just wasn't
doing a good job,

09:48.133 --> 09:50.633
and I started to have
really dark thoughts,

09:50.667 --> 09:52.300
and I think
my brother's suicide, so--

09:52.333 --> 09:54.600
- Yeah, see, that worries me
because I feel like

09:54.633 --> 09:59.100
I always thought that
that was so far out of, like,

09:59.133 --> 10:01.533
the realm of anything
that I would ever do,

10:01.567 --> 10:04.066
but, like, three weeks ago,
four weeks ago,

10:04.100 --> 10:05.734
I remember driving my car
on the freeway

10:05.767 --> 10:07.066
and just thinking, like,
what if I just

10:07.100 --> 10:08.533
drove it off the edge?
- Well--

10:08.567 --> 10:10.000
What if I just did that?

10:10.033 --> 10:12.300
How is that a real thought?
Like...

10:12.333 --> 10:15.667
I don't wanna drag Tom
into my bullsh--.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.233
- But I-I don't think
it is bullsh--.

10:17.266 --> 10:19.100
And I think when you have
a partner,

10:19.133 --> 10:21.066
I think that's part of who
you are.

10:21.100 --> 10:24.033
- Yeah. There's that
underlying feeling,

10:24.066 --> 10:26.533
I think, of, like, despair
at times.

10:26.567 --> 10:29.600
It happens more often
when I'm not busy.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.734
- Do you think also because
you've been through,

10:31.767 --> 10:33.533
like,
suddenly all these changes,

10:33.567 --> 10:36.166
suddenly you're, you know,
now you're in a house.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.233
- Oh, my gosh, yes.
- And it's that responsibility.

10:38.266 --> 10:40.200
- 'Cause I also thought
I'm feeling this way.

10:40.233 --> 10:41.700
Soon as we get out
of this apartment...

10:41.734 --> 10:42.667
- It's gonna change.
- ...I'll feel better.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.133
- And then it didn't.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.700
- And then it didn't.
It's still there.

10:45.734 --> 10:48.600
- Right. So maybe it's always
gonna be there.

10:48.633 --> 10:51.633
- For a long time, I was kind of
under this impression

10:51.667 --> 10:55.233
that my depression
was situational,

10:55.266 --> 10:57.233
that I was
in this sh---ty apartment,

10:57.266 --> 11:01.100
and that that was what was
causing it.

11:01.133 --> 11:03.633
And now I thought, you know,
I'm moving

11:03.667 --> 11:06.333
to this beautiful house,
a home of my dreams,

11:06.367 --> 11:10.633
and that's gonna make everything
go away, but it hasn't.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.633
- Okay, so you need
a distraction.

11:13.667 --> 11:15.233
- Yeah.
- If you want to work,

11:15.266 --> 11:17.600
like, just a couple of days
a week now

11:17.633 --> 11:20.000
to get you out and do it...

11:20.033 --> 11:22.133
- Just something to force me
to put makeup on...

11:22.166 --> 11:23.633
- You have to be out there
every single day.

11:23.667 --> 11:25.633
- ...for me to brush my hair.
- My God, that--

11:25.667 --> 11:27.300
No, I don't wanna hear that
from you.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.667
I want you to get up every day
and put your makeup on

11:30.700 --> 11:33.266
and take your shower
and be the best you can be.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.100
- Sometimes it's just hard
to want to.

11:35.133 --> 11:39.033
It's just, you know, to think,
who cares, you know?

11:39.066 --> 11:41.200
- Tom cares. I care.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.333
You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

11:43.367 --> 11:45.033
- Say, "This is just me."
- Yes.

11:45.066 --> 11:46.600
- Do some exercise.
Do all of the things

11:46.633 --> 11:48.367
that will push you
in a positive direction.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.033
- Yeah.

11:50.066 --> 11:51.667
- It's the best advice
I can give you.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.700
- This is me.

11:54.734 --> 11:56.734
♪ Time to shine ♪

11:58.066 --> 12:01.767
♪ So bright ♪

12:02.000 --> 12:06.400
♪ Let's shine,
I need another night ♪

12:06.433 --> 12:09.033
- I met this drag queen
the other day,

12:09.066 --> 12:11.300
and I was like,
"I wanna, like, dress in drag,"

12:11.333 --> 12:13.000
and she was, like,
"You could be bio drag."

12:13.033 --> 12:14.667
I was like, "What is that?"
And she was like,

12:14.700 --> 12:16.667
"It's where you're, like,
a chick,

12:16.700 --> 12:18.300
and you dress up
as a drag queen."

12:18.333 --> 12:21.033
- Love it. This would be
my first Pride not working.

12:21.066 --> 12:22.333
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.133
- So much more fun.
- Yeah. I'm excited.

12:24.166 --> 12:25.333
- Oh, my God. You have to--
- Wait. I think it's

12:25.367 --> 12:28.000
my first Pride not working, too.
- Is it?

12:28.033 --> 12:29.266
- Yeah, we can--
- Yeah! We can walk around!

12:29.300 --> 12:31.000
- Yes.
- Jax is so pissed.

12:31.033 --> 12:32.400
Like, he's so jealous
that we all get to go.

12:32.433 --> 12:34.433
- Why? Jax is--
- Because he's working at SUR.

12:34.467 --> 12:36.000
- He's bartending?

12:36.033 --> 12:37.233
- Yeah.
- That sucks.

12:37.266 --> 12:38.467
- Shut the up.
- He's so salty.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.400
- Oh, my God.
- I saw that James

12:41.433 --> 12:43.734
was gonna be DJing, though,
at TomTom.

12:43.767 --> 12:46.667
- I'm sorry.
Where are we where James

12:46.700 --> 12:50.633
is the only person
that can DJ an event?

12:52.300 --> 12:56.133
- TomTom, get ready.
- Happy Pride!

12:56.166 --> 12:58.066
I'm so excited to be
in the parade.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.667
I've got my pageant wave down.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.033
Smile and wave.
- Ahh.

13:02.066 --> 13:05.033
That looks good.

13:05.066 --> 13:07.266
- Are you gonna come to my set
and see me DJ?

13:07.300 --> 13:11.133
- Yeah, I have to see what time
my shift starts,

13:11.166 --> 13:14.100
but I'll try to come for
the beginning of your set, yeah.

13:14.133 --> 13:15.333
- Okay.
- Honestly, I'm surprised

13:15.367 --> 13:19.300
Schwartz wants you to DJ
at TomTom today,

13:19.333 --> 13:22.333
given the way that you spoke
to Katie last year.

13:22.367 --> 13:26.100
- Katie got me fired,
and then Katie quit.

13:26.133 --> 13:27.767
You know?
What is she doing all day?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.233
Sitting on her ass
in Valley Village

13:30.266 --> 13:33.100
with her feet up on the couch
doing absolutely nothing.

13:33.133 --> 13:34.367
"If you
don't fire James right now,

13:34.400 --> 13:36.066
"I'm leaving. I'm outta here.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.266
I'm going to my house
in Valley Village."

13:40.200 --> 13:43.100
- Where do you and Lala
stand now?

13:43.133 --> 13:47.433
- Um, blocked, and she--
she's just completely

13:47.467 --> 13:49.667
cut me off from my life again,
like, you know?

13:49.700 --> 13:52.100
For those of you living
under a rock, okay,

13:52.133 --> 13:56.033
50 Cent decided
to call out Randall

13:56.066 --> 13:59.133
on some money that he thought
Randall owed him.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.333
He wrote, "Give me my money
by Monday."

14:01.367 --> 14:04.367
You know, so I'm liking posts.
I'm thinking this is funny,

14:04.400 --> 14:06.000
and I post a picture,
and I'm like,

14:06.033 --> 14:07.767
"Oh, yeah, I need my money
by Monday."

14:08.000 --> 14:10.100
- That was unacceptable for him
to post something like that,

14:10.133 --> 14:12.000
just because
he thought it was funny

14:12.033 --> 14:13.700
and he wanted a lot of likes.

14:13.734 --> 14:16.000
- Guys, this isn't just no
----ing, like,

14:16.033 --> 14:19.400
Instagram feed when you're at
Denny's having breakfast, okay?

14:19.433 --> 14:22.033
This is across America, viral.

14:22.066 --> 14:27.367
- We were so brand-new in our
rekindling of our friendship.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.500
You should be
on your best behavior,

14:29.533 --> 14:32.333
and I don't find it funny
in any way, shape, or form.

14:32.367 --> 14:34.266
- I found it hilarious,
and, you know,

14:34.300 --> 14:36.500
it landed me in kind
of a bad place with Lala.

14:36.533 --> 14:39.000
Honestly, I wasn't trying
to be hurtful.

14:39.033 --> 14:41.333
- Yeah, you were doing it--
- I was just making a joke.

14:41.367 --> 14:43.000
I was just making a joke.
- Right.

14:43.033 --> 14:45.166
- I'm sure I'm gonna be
seeing her later.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.033
- Like, how are you gonna
approach this?

14:47.066 --> 14:49.033
- He's gonna have to ask
to talk to me.

14:49.066 --> 14:50.367
- Yeah.
- I don't have anything

14:50.400 --> 14:52.300
to say to him.
- He just always does this.

14:52.333 --> 14:53.400
Gosh.
- He can't help himself.

14:53.433 --> 14:55.033
- He really can't.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.166
- I'm leaving here, in, like,
30 minutes.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.500
- Okay. Great.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.600
- I was supposed to go get
my hair done this morning

15:37.633 --> 15:39.500
with Raquel and her hairstylist,

15:39.533 --> 15:43.166
and then I wake up to this
text message from Raquel.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.467
"My hairstylist just told me
that she can't take

15:44.500 --> 15:46.200
"three girls to Pride.

15:46.233 --> 15:48.300
"I didn't think Scheana
was going to make it,

15:48.333 --> 15:50.600
"but now she can. I'm so sorry.
Thank you for understanding.

15:50.633 --> 15:56.033
I'll see you at PRIDE!"
In all caps. Rainbow emoji.

15:56.066 --> 16:00.467
You clearly invited Scheana.
She didn't wanna go,

16:00.500 --> 16:03.467
then found out that I was going,
and then all of a sudden,

16:03.500 --> 16:06.000
Scheana's like, "Oh, wait.
I do wanna get my hair done.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.600
Looks like Dayna
can't come anymore."

16:08.633 --> 16:10.567
I feel like this is what
everyone's wearing.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.500
My girlfriends are wearing
a 2-piece and shorts.

16:12.533 --> 16:14.633
Do you think they're gonna be
mean to me

16:14.667 --> 16:16.100
and call me slutty?

16:16.133 --> 16:18.133
Every person that works there.

16:18.166 --> 16:20.166
I think they're going to.

16:22.533 --> 16:24.066
I have to work with them,
and it's unpleasant

16:24.100 --> 16:25.467
to be around people

16:25.500 --> 16:27.433
who hate you for no reason
when you're working.

16:27.467 --> 16:30.467
It's hard enough leaving TomTom
where I had a bunch of friends

16:30.500 --> 16:33.433
to walk into a new restaurant
where Scheana

16:33.467 --> 16:36.433
and her little tribe are making
my job miserable.

16:36.467 --> 16:38.567
They have been real nice
to my face,

16:38.600 --> 16:40.200
talking mad sh--
behind my back.

16:44.700 --> 16:48.066
- You're so wise.
- I am pretty ----ing wise.

16:49.433 --> 16:52.133
- Coming up...
- Where are you, Raquel?

16:52.166 --> 16:53.633
What the is wrong
with you?

16:53.667 --> 16:56.300
Go yourself.
How dare you miss my whole set?

16:56.333 --> 16:58.233
Why? Why?

17:04.467 --> 17:05.133
♪ White hot, just right,

17:21.333 --> 17:23.166
- We're down a food runner,
and now

17:23.200 --> 17:24.533
we're also down a bartender.

17:24.567 --> 17:26.100
We have one bartender
in the--in the lounge,

17:26.133 --> 17:27.333
and one bartender
in the restaurant.

17:27.367 --> 17:29.467
- Why?
- I have no idea.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.467
Are you ----ing kidding me?

17:31.500 --> 17:33.467
This is my first big event
that I've worked

17:33.500 --> 17:36.233
as a manager,
ad we don't have enough staff.

17:37.633 --> 17:38.667
No.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.600
Like, you, Peter.

17:40.633 --> 17:42.567
I hope you're having fun with
your pink car in the parade.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.233
Edward, when you get a second,
can you take out

17:44.266 --> 17:45.600
the SUR brunch sign as well?

17:45.633 --> 17:48.200
- We had six bartenders
back here last year,

17:48.233 --> 17:50.200
and there was a line
out the back.

17:50.233 --> 17:53.100
One bartender, you're on crack.
How are you down a bartender?

17:53.133 --> 17:55.133
It's the biggest day
of bar history.

17:55.166 --> 17:56.200
- Jax, there's only one
bartender.

17:56.233 --> 17:58.100
You have to jump back there.

17:58.133 --> 18:00.100
- I am, till 1,
and then I'm leaving.

18:00.133 --> 18:03.500
- That's fine,
but we need you until 1:00.

18:06.767 --> 18:09.300
So...can you help them
set up, please?

18:09.333 --> 18:12.233
- No. I don't do that.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.233
- So annoying.

18:15.266 --> 18:17.633
- I mean, I don't think people
care about the waitstaff

18:17.667 --> 18:19.633
waving on a float.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.367
This is gonna be
an absolute sh--show.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.633
Why the hell am I here?
If anybody should be

18:22.667 --> 18:24.300
on the float,
it should be ----ing me.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.633
I think the best way to do this

18:25.667 --> 18:27.233
is just to be drunk
for the whole time.

18:27.266 --> 18:28.133
- The whole time.
- I'm drinking now.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.600
- Jax,
where's your Pride accessories?

18:33.633 --> 18:35.500
Are you not dressing up today?
- I don't dress up.

18:35.533 --> 18:38.166
Would you like me to go down
on you looking like this?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.233
- No.

18:39.266 --> 18:41.533
- I'm so nervous for today!

18:41.567 --> 18:43.734
- Should be.

18:49.734 --> 18:53.300
- Happy Pride! Hi!
- Whoo! Hi!

18:53.333 --> 18:55.767
- TomTom's first Pride.
- We're so excited.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.266
- Are you gonna be
in the SUR car?

18:57.300 --> 18:58.667
- We'll be behind with the boys.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.767
- We're gonna be walking behind
with our flags,

19:01.000 --> 19:04.166
and I have my little bi flag
with me, representing.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.533
- That's true.

19:05.567 --> 19:09.533
- This Pride is my first Pride
publicly out

19:09.567 --> 19:12.400
as a bisexual queen.

19:12.433 --> 19:13.734
Before I'd be at Pride
with my friends,

19:13.767 --> 19:15.600
and I'd be like,
this feels weird.

19:15.633 --> 19:19.734
Like, what I am, like, in
the closet at Pride every year?

19:19.767 --> 19:22.300
Yeah, take the trans flag.
I have another trans flag.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.000
I feel better now
that people know

19:24.033 --> 19:26.500
because I'm living
more truthfully.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.600
I'm a B.

19:29.633 --> 19:32.700
I always got A's,
but I'll take this B.

19:32.734 --> 19:34.500
- I think it's a bit late for me
to start waving this now.

19:36.433 --> 19:38.266
- It's never too late, Lisa.
- I think I missed the boat.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.000
- It's never too late.
- Never.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.767
- About to open the doors,
right?

19:48.734 --> 19:50.567
- We're just trying to get it
all sorted before we open.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.767
- All right, Max. Good luck,
man. We love you, dude.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.433
- All right, man.

19:54.467 --> 19:55.500
Later.

19:55.533 --> 19:56.633
- Whew.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.033
- 20 minutes.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.333
- Yo, yo.

20:08.367 --> 20:10.333
- What's up, buddy?
- What up?

20:10.367 --> 20:11.734
- We're just talking
about what we're gonna do

20:11.767 --> 20:13.433
with your little area.
- This is it, yeah?

20:13.467 --> 20:14.500
- I was gonna keep this
little table here.

20:14.533 --> 20:16.467
- Yeah? No more closet for me.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.066
Thank you, party gods.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.667
I'm just so excited that
there's a DJ booth

20:19.700 --> 20:22.333
and they're not having me DJ
upstairs in the closet

20:22.367 --> 20:23.467
on toilet paper again.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.300
Now that I'm on the floor,

20:28.333 --> 20:30.567
just wait to see how much
this party turns up. Just wait.

20:30.600 --> 20:31.767
- All right, we're open.

20:42.533 --> 20:43.767
- Can I have some Aperol?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.333
- Hi! Jax.
- ...on the other side.

20:45.367 --> 20:47.367
- Dayna.
- You're Dayna.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.367
- Yeah. It's me.

20:49.400 --> 20:53.000
Hmm. We met last year
at the Mondrian.

20:53.033 --> 20:54.600
- Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
- What?

20:54.633 --> 20:56.500
- I feel a storm coming in.
- Oh, God.

20:56.533 --> 20:58.367
- Are you trying to say that
hoes are in the hotel room?

21:00.300 --> 21:01.367
- Whoo!

21:01.400 --> 21:02.767
- But...Okurr!

21:03.000 --> 21:04.600
Nice to meet ya.

21:04.633 --> 21:06.567
- Dayna. Oh!
I've heard a lot about you.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.100
- Well--Oh. Uh-oh.

21:08.133 --> 21:10.000
- She's an attractive woman,
yeah, sure,

21:10.033 --> 21:12.433
but I'm not--She's not hot.
That's not my type.

21:12.467 --> 21:14.633
I'm not into blondes.
I'm not into...that.

21:17.066 --> 21:18.500
Hey-o!

21:18.533 --> 21:20.533
Oh, you look beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

21:20.567 --> 21:21.633
You do, too.
- Mwah.

21:21.667 --> 21:23.266
I'm really picky, though.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.734
I wouldn't, like,
go up and talk to her.

21:24.767 --> 21:27.333
Are you working at both places?
- I was at TomTom.

21:27.367 --> 21:29.667
I left there completely.
- Why?

21:29.700 --> 21:32.000
- I was hosting.
Because I came here to serve,

21:32.033 --> 21:34.100
and I didn't wanna do both
because I also have a day job.

21:34.133 --> 21:36.433
- Oh, I thought it was maybe
because you were dating Max.

21:36.467 --> 21:38.000
- Well, and then that was
a bonus...

21:38.033 --> 21:39.533
- Oh.
- ...that that happened.

21:39.567 --> 21:41.000
So I was like, "Great.
I guess I'm at SUR now.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.066
I don't have to deal
with any drama

21:42.100 --> 21:43.500
that might come our way, so...

21:43.533 --> 21:45.667
- Well...have you talked
to Scheana yet?

21:45.700 --> 21:47.533
- I know. I'm sorry.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.133
- Are you ----ing kidding me?
She's such a bitch to me.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.633
I've never met a less mature
person in my life.

21:51.667 --> 21:53.333
- I like your attitude.
I like it.

21:53.367 --> 21:55.133
- Uh, I can be cool with her
in two seconds

21:55.166 --> 21:56.633
if she would get over herself.
- Right, but she doesn't ha--

21:56.667 --> 21:58.600
- But she's choosing to, like,
make it a thing,

21:58.633 --> 22:00.533
and I'm like, "Bitch, I'm not--
I don't need to kiss your ass.

22:00.567 --> 22:03.600
Like, if you're gonna keep being
this way to me, off."

22:08.400 --> 22:10.000
- Thank you again for
inviting me this morning.

22:10.033 --> 22:12.500
- Aw, you're welcome.
Your hair looks great.

22:12.533 --> 22:17.567
And honestly, I--I'm kinda glad
we didn't have Dayna there

22:17.600 --> 22:19.500
because we were already
running late as it is, so...

22:19.533 --> 22:23.066
- Yeah. She has to understand,
because I'm not inviting her

22:23.100 --> 22:25.400
to, like, braid my hair
and paint my toes,

22:25.433 --> 22:28.600
like, over for a sleepover,
like, I'm not nice?

22:28.633 --> 22:30.133
Stop trying
to make Dayna happen.

22:30.166 --> 22:31.633
It's not gonna happen
for me right now.

22:31.667 --> 22:34.033
- It worked out for the best.
- I agree.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.533
- I told you you weren't gonna
want your shirt on.

22:40.567 --> 22:41.567
- Whatever Lisa says, goes.
I don't care. Whatever.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.400
- You know?

22:43.433 --> 22:46.066
- I said, "Keep your shirt on.
Take your trousers off."

22:46.100 --> 22:47.567
- Oh. Oh.
- Or that.

22:53.166 --> 22:54.600
- Yeah, I'm so glad I got to--

22:54.633 --> 22:56.667
- Wait. Did you talk to her?
- To Lisa?

22:56.700 --> 22:58.400
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I did.

22:58.433 --> 22:59.667
I went to her house yesterday.
- How'd it go?

22:59.700 --> 23:01.133
- I talked to her
about a lot of stuff.

23:01.166 --> 23:02.567
It was great. She was saying,
you know,

23:02.600 --> 23:03.734
"Maybe, like,
once or twice a week,

23:03.767 --> 23:05.700
you can come into SUR"

23:05.734 --> 23:08.734
'cause it's a good way to force
me to just get out of the house.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.734
I need that, you know?
- I'm also down the street, too.

23:10.767 --> 23:14.367
I wanna stay active.
I'm teaching myself how to knit.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.633
- No way.

23:17.700 --> 23:20.600
- Oh, mother----er.

23:20.633 --> 23:24.066
We could be, like, little
crafty, like, old ladies...

23:24.100 --> 23:25.133
- Little craft ladies.
- ...in the Val.

23:25.166 --> 23:26.533
- Yeah.

23:34.700 --> 23:38.033
- Isn't it great?
- Yeah.

23:40.133 --> 23:43.000
- First TomTom Pride.

23:43.033 --> 23:45.700
- It is the first TomTom Pride!
- Yeah.

23:45.734 --> 23:47.533
- It is the only day

23:47.567 --> 23:49.700
that, like, camel toe
is totally acceptable.

23:49.734 --> 23:51.100
- Oh, hell, yeah.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.133
- Excuse me, guys.

23:57.667 --> 23:59.400
Hey, guys. What's up?

23:59.433 --> 24:01.033
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:01.066 --> 24:02.734
- Wanted to say hi.
Happy Pride and everything.

24:02.767 --> 24:04.600
Want to chat for, like,
two minutes?

24:04.633 --> 24:05.600
- Yeah, just let me grab
my coke real quick.

24:05.633 --> 24:06.734
- All right.

24:06.767 --> 24:08.500
- I'll just come
to the DJ booth.

24:08.533 --> 24:10.767
- All right. Good to see you.
Have fun today.

24:13.133 --> 24:15.133
- I don't care if it's a day
of acceptance.

24:15.166 --> 24:17.633
I'm not accepting him.

24:17.667 --> 24:19.100
- I don't want him to die.

24:19.133 --> 24:20.700
I don't want him to get
physically hurt,

24:20.734 --> 24:23.066
but, like, I don't wish him
the best at all.

24:23.100 --> 24:24.734
Who am I kidding?

24:24.767 --> 24:28.233
Who would I be if I didn't wish
James physical harm?

24:28.266 --> 24:30.033
Give me a break.

24:32.533 --> 24:34.667
- Away from me.

24:34.700 --> 24:35.767
- Coming up...

24:36.000 --> 24:37.600
- Raquel's at SUR, right?

24:37.633 --> 24:39.500
- No, she's here.
She's not working today.

24:39.533 --> 24:40.667
- She's working.
- No, she's not.

24:40.700 --> 24:43.767
- Yes, she is.
- Oh. Is she?

24:44.000 --> 24:46.166
- Why is she here?

24:58.734 --> 25:00.300
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

25:02.033 --> 25:04.066
All right, you ready?
Feeling good?

25:04.100 --> 25:05.133
- Yeah.

25:21.233 --> 25:24.100
- Nice cape.

25:28.166 --> 25:31.133
Just wanted to, you know,
say I'm sorry.

25:31.166 --> 25:35.166
I didn't realize that would be,

25:35.200 --> 25:36.633
you know...

25:51.166 --> 25:56.033
- Sobriety is
my number one priority.

25:56.066 --> 25:59.266
I know that he was ----ed up
when he did that post.

25:59.300 --> 26:04.266
And I can't allow people
to get to me

26:04.300 --> 26:07.066
to the point
where I may fall off my rocker.

26:09.000 --> 26:09.767
- I know, and that's when
I think--

26:10.000 --> 26:11.600
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

26:11.633 --> 26:13.333
And that's when I think back
and I'm like, you know,

26:13.367 --> 26:15.533
I think you're taking it
a little bit hard.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.233
- Thank you.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.100
- Thank you.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

26:37.700 --> 26:40.200
- Yeah.

26:45.633 --> 26:49.000
I think James has a lot
of issues.

26:49.033 --> 26:52.133
I think he has
an addiction problem.

26:52.166 --> 26:54.633
He has a bunch
of bobbleheads around him,

26:54.667 --> 26:58.333
including his girlfriend,
that don't give a sh--

26:58.367 --> 27:01.400
about what his future may hold,

27:01.433 --> 27:03.700
which could get
very ugly and sad.

27:12.734 --> 27:14.767
- Oh, yes, absolutely.

27:16.734 --> 27:18.700
- I'm so hot.

27:18.734 --> 27:21.033
- What can I getcha?

27:21.066 --> 27:23.033
A martini on a day like today?

27:23.066 --> 27:25.200
- Strawberry-tini?
- Come on, man!

27:25.233 --> 27:27.033
- Good. How are they doing
over there?

27:27.066 --> 27:28.767
- It's so busy. I can't wait
for Peter to get here.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.300
I'm, like, by myself.
- This is like--I can't...

27:31.333 --> 27:33.000
- I'm sweating.
- ...not even believe

27:33.033 --> 27:35.133
how crazy this is.
- Yeah, welcome to Pride.

29:21.533 --> 29:23.200
- Happy Pride, everyone!

29:24.500 --> 29:25.500
- Oh, sh--!

29:28.033 --> 29:31.200
- I feel electric. I feel alive.

29:31.233 --> 29:33.100
I feel like a rock star,
you know?

29:33.133 --> 29:36.400
I feel like Freddie Mercury
walking out onstage, 1985,

29:36.433 --> 29:39.266
Live Aid, about to sing
"Bohemian Rhapsody,"

29:39.300 --> 29:41.433
and the crowd's just like,
"Aah!"

29:46.033 --> 29:48.700
Tom! Tom! Tom!
Tom! Tom!

29:50.367 --> 29:52.166
- I wanna thank all of you
for being here

29:52.200 --> 29:54.734
for TomTom's very first Pride.

29:57.333 --> 29:58.767
- Sorry.

30:09.133 --> 30:10.400
- It's a big moment for me.
It's Pride. It's TomTom,

30:10.433 --> 30:12.467
and I'm back.
I wanna do a great job,

30:12.500 --> 30:14.300
and I want Raquel to see that.

30:16.066 --> 30:17.300
So, like, you know, she can see

30:17.333 --> 30:20.300
that how amazing
her boyfriend is. Duh!

30:20.333 --> 30:23.300
Hey, go yourself.
How dare you miss my whole set?

30:23.333 --> 30:26.266
What the is
wrong with you?

30:27.300 --> 30:32.266
Where are you, Raquel?
Where are you?

30:32.300 --> 30:35.467
Why? Why?

30:40.467 --> 30:42.200
This is bullsh--.

30:42.233 --> 30:43.233
- Coming up...

30:43.266 --> 30:44.367
- Are you 34, or are you 16?

30:44.400 --> 30:45.533
I'm literally embarrassed
for you.

30:45.567 --> 30:47.500
- Okay.
- It just seems like

30:47.533 --> 30:49.300
you're very threatened of me.
- It's not a threatening thing.

30:49.333 --> 30:52.400
It's just kind of like
what are your intentions?

31:04.133 --> 31:06.100
- What's your drag name?
- Lala ----.

31:06.133 --> 31:09.266
- If I was a porn star, my name
would be Beau Ner-up-her-ass.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.133
Last name's "Ner-up-her-ass."
- Beau Ner-up-her-ass.

31:12.300 --> 31:13.533
- She's Scandinavian.

31:18.667 --> 31:21.500
- TomTom, TomTom.
- Oh, my God.

31:21.533 --> 31:24.266
- Yes!

31:29.066 --> 31:30.667
- You gotta take a shot of this.

31:30.700 --> 31:33.567
- No! No! No!
I've done that before with you.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.233
I'm not doing that.

31:42.633 --> 31:45.066
- Whoo!

31:45.100 --> 31:47.033
- I'll be locking up.
Don't worry.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.367
- We've been a part of this
community for almost 10 years,

31:52.400 --> 31:54.500
but to be business owners now
in the heart of it,

31:54.533 --> 31:56.300
it's, like...
- So amazing.

31:56.333 --> 31:57.333
- I know.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.600
- I love you. I was just upset
'cause you missed my set,

32:03.633 --> 32:05.367
and you're the one person
I want to impress.

32:05.400 --> 32:09.567
- Aw! You do impress me.
Every day you impress me.

32:09.600 --> 32:10.633
- Okay.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.567
- When James called me,

32:12.600 --> 32:15.533
I was obviously
really upset because

32:15.567 --> 32:19.433
he wasn't even hearing me out.
But I don't wanna upset him

32:19.467 --> 32:22.433
because he does explode
at times.

32:30.166 --> 32:32.233
- Does anybody want a refill?
- Oh, yeah.

32:32.266 --> 32:33.533
- Okay.

32:33.567 --> 32:37.433
- Oh, mother----.

32:44.367 --> 32:46.266
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.600
- I don't see Raquel.
Where's Raquel?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.200
- I haven't seen her all day.
- She was--

32:49.233 --> 32:50.600
Well, she was in the parade
with me,

32:50.633 --> 32:52.500
but now she's supposed
to come back and work.

32:52.533 --> 32:54.333
- Well, that's really
the last thing I need today.

32:54.367 --> 32:56.166
You know that there was only
two bartenders scheduled?

32:56.200 --> 32:57.467
We were down a bartender.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.433
Antonio, the new busser,
didn't show up.

32:59.467 --> 33:01.300
We were down a food runner,
and we're down a hostess.

33:01.333 --> 33:04.533
We're literally down one person
in every single position.

33:04.567 --> 33:09.633
- So she's not here.
- No.

33:16.633 --> 33:18.500
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, my God.

33:18.533 --> 33:23.200
- Hi, Lisa. Happy Pride.
- Happy Pride to you, too.

33:23.233 --> 33:26.266
How are you?
- Very good.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.433
I just wanted to say thank you
for having me at TomTom.

33:28.467 --> 33:32.500
I know it's been--
- Well, it wasn't my decision.

33:32.533 --> 33:35.667
- It was my decision, actually.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.367
- Hi.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.700
- It was my decision
to have you here.

33:38.734 --> 33:42.367
- Really?
- No.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.266
- How are you?
- I'm good.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.767
- Good to see you guys.
- The music's been really good.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.633
- Thank you. Thank you.
That means a lot.

33:49.667 --> 33:52.600
- I saw Raquel.
She looks really cute.

33:52.633 --> 33:54.734
She looks really cute.
- Oh, so cute

33:54.767 --> 33:57.200
with her floaties on and her
little goggles on her hair.

33:57.233 --> 33:59.567
- I know. Someone needs to
teach her to swim immediately.

33:59.600 --> 34:03.200
- Raquel's at SUR, right?
- No, she's here.

34:03.233 --> 34:05.266
She's not working today.
- She's working.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.400
- No, she's not.
- Yes, she is.

34:06.433 --> 34:09.166
- Oh, is she?
- Yes.

34:09.200 --> 34:12.000
- Oh, and then she's, uh, yeah.
- Why is she here?

34:12.033 --> 34:13.633
- No, she wasn't
on the schedule, Lisa.

34:13.667 --> 34:15.500
She got off with Nathalie,
actually.

34:15.533 --> 34:18.567
- Oh, so James is telling me
who's on the SUR schedule?

34:18.600 --> 34:20.734
The only person that James
can talk about

34:20.767 --> 34:24.633
when it comes to schedule
is himself, and he's not on it.

34:24.667 --> 34:26.400
So you're doing all right?

34:26.433 --> 34:29.700
- Yeah. Definitely.
I really think so, yeah.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.633
- So you're not drinking,
though?

34:34.467 --> 34:35.633
- No, I haven't been drinking
today.

34:35.667 --> 34:36.667
- Yes, you are.

34:41.533 --> 34:44.433
- I did a really good job,
though, today.

34:44.467 --> 34:47.734
- I know, but it's about
longevity, isn't it, James?

34:47.767 --> 34:50.000
- I'm trying, yeah.
- I know you're trying.

34:50.033 --> 34:52.266
- Yeah.
- You're very trying.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.367
- I'm very trying.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.633
I just killed it.
This wasn't the conversation

34:56.667 --> 34:58.667
I wanted to have with Lisa,
really, after my set.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.333
I'm just gonna head home
after this.

35:00.367 --> 35:01.700
Like, I don't need
to stick around.

35:01.734 --> 35:05.233
- Listen, I'm glad you did
a good job today.

35:05.266 --> 35:06.767
- Thank you.
- But I'm not interested

35:07.000 --> 35:09.433
in you doing one job.
I'm interested in your welfare.

35:09.467 --> 35:10.667
- Yeah.
- Do you understand that?

35:10.700 --> 35:11.767
- Yeah.
- Do you?

35:12.000 --> 35:14.200
- Thank you, Lisa.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.467
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.333
Enjoy.

35:35.600 --> 35:38.734
- Raquel just showed up.
- That's unacceptable.

35:43.066 --> 35:45.567
- Raquel, where were you?
Like, we're missing servers.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.433
We had you on the schedule.
Why didn't you show up?

35:48.467 --> 35:50.033
- I lost track of time.

35:50.066 --> 35:51.533
We literally--
the float took forever.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.266
- You were on the--
no, no, no, no, no.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.066
You were in the car with me.
- Yeah, I was.

35:55.100 --> 35:56.667
- You got out before--
- I feel like

35:56.700 --> 35:58.600
a bodyguard boyfriend.
I'm gonna step out of this.

35:58.633 --> 36:00.400
'Cause I had a great set
at TomTom.

36:00.433 --> 36:04.367
If you need me, let me know,
okay? I love you.

36:05.767 --> 36:08.266
- I just lost track of time.
Honestly--

36:08.300 --> 36:09.567
- We were down--
- Have I ever been late

36:09.600 --> 36:11.500
or missed a shift before?
- I understand.

36:11.533 --> 36:13.266
I understand that, but we--
we were down a bunch of servers,

36:13.300 --> 36:14.700
and we needed help,
especially when--

36:14.734 --> 36:16.500
- I know it won't make up
for it,

36:16.533 --> 36:19.266
but can I take a shift now?
I'll work all night.

36:19.300 --> 36:21.700
- We needed you hours ago.

36:21.734 --> 36:24.734
- I feel really, really bad
about missing the shift.

36:24.767 --> 36:27.100
I really do.
I ran over to TomTom

36:27.133 --> 36:29.767
to see James finish up his set.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
He called me. He was super upset
that I missed his set.

36:34.033 --> 36:35.266
- You're obligated to me
while you're here,

36:35.300 --> 36:37.033
not your boyfriend.

36:37.066 --> 36:40.433
You have to figure out
where your priorities are,

36:40.467 --> 36:45.500
all right, in relation to
boyfriend or your job, okay?

36:45.533 --> 36:48.667
- It will not happen again.
- Yeah. Go.

37:03.166 --> 37:06.033
- Hey, guys, first of all,
I wanna thank you so much

37:06.066 --> 37:07.533
for coming to TomTom today.

37:11.433 --> 37:12.667
- We are so lucky
to be partnered

37:12.700 --> 37:16.166
with an amazing, amazing
business owner.

37:16.200 --> 37:20.400
- Lisa Vanderpump!

37:20.433 --> 37:23.333
- Tom and I somehow make it
to, like, our 75th Pride.

37:23.367 --> 37:27.734
We'll sort of teleport in
on our hovering TomTom mobile.

37:27.767 --> 37:30.066
We got matching space outfits.

37:30.100 --> 37:32.734
Actually, we're like--
we're like android.

37:32.767 --> 37:35.633
They've achieved singularity,
so it's, like, it's still us.

37:35.667 --> 37:39.100
- Happy Pride, everybody!

37:39.133 --> 37:41.433
- I can totally picture it.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.400
- ♪ I'll open Pandora's Box

37:54.433 --> 37:56.367

38:40.700 --> 38:43.567
Lisa Vanderpump
is in the house!

38:47.066 --> 38:50.500
- Pride means so much to me.

38:50.533 --> 38:53.000
- Happy Pride!

38:53.033 --> 38:55.000
- It's a day where people
can come out,

38:55.033 --> 39:00.000
and they can express
themselves...

39:00.033 --> 39:01.767
- Whoo! That was work.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.600
- ...ish.

39:04.633 --> 39:08.066
- Whoo! We're good.

39:12.633 --> 39:14.633
- Excuse me.

39:14.667 --> 39:16.467
- Can I talk to you outside
really quick

39:16.500 --> 39:19.533
before I start working,
have a ----ing panic attack?

39:26.266 --> 39:29.200
I'm just, like, shaking
right now.

39:29.233 --> 39:31.033
Um...I just wanted
to talk to you.

39:35.567 --> 39:37.767
I feel like when we were here
last week,

39:38.000 --> 39:39.767
and we talked out back,
like, everything was cool,

39:40.000 --> 39:41.667
and then I'm hearing that
you're, like, saying

39:41.700 --> 39:43.066
that I'm being mean to you.

39:43.100 --> 39:45.033
- I want you to be nice
to Dayna.

39:45.066 --> 39:47.700
She doesn't feel as included.

39:47.734 --> 39:51.233
- I don't feel like--Maybe
the first day when we all

39:51.266 --> 39:53.133
kinda ----ing hazed you,
and I apologize

39:53.166 --> 39:54.633
for being a bitch or whatever.
- No one else hazed me.

39:54.667 --> 39:57.767
It was--It was you.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.533
- Are you 34 or are you 16?

39:59.567 --> 40:00.700
I'm literally embarrassed
for you.

40:00.734 --> 40:02.633
- Okay.
- Raquel invited me,

40:02.667 --> 40:04.100
and I know maybe she didn't know
your situation, our situation--

40:04.133 --> 40:05.633
- She didn't know
if I was able to come.

40:05.667 --> 40:07.166
- You can't even be
in the same room as me,

40:07.200 --> 40:08.633
so don't tell me
you're not being mean to me

40:08.667 --> 40:09.600
or not cool with me
if you can't even be

40:09.633 --> 40:11.233
in the same room with me.

40:11.266 --> 40:13.266
- I never said I couldn't be
in the same room as you.

40:13.300 --> 40:15.066
- So then why couldn't I be
at the hair thing today?

40:15.100 --> 40:17.133
- Because they could only take
three people,

40:17.166 --> 40:18.266
and there would have been
four of us.

40:18.300 --> 40:20.033
- I mean--
- That was why,

40:20.066 --> 40:21.266
and we barely even had time
for the two of us.

40:21.300 --> 40:22.734
- Scheana may have missed
her calling

40:22.767 --> 40:24.533
as a press secretary
for some politician

40:24.567 --> 40:28.200
because this bitch puts a spin
on everything.

40:28.233 --> 40:29.767
Look, I have to get back
to my tables.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.500
It just seems like
you're very threatened of me,

40:31.533 --> 40:33.100
and I don't know why.
- I'm not threatened.

40:33.133 --> 40:34.734
- But I'm not trying to, like--
- That's not--

40:34.767 --> 40:36.600
It's not a threatening thing.
I don't know what it is.

40:36.633 --> 40:38.500
There's just
something irking me.

40:38.533 --> 40:41.200
I think I felt like you just--
call me territorial or whatever.

40:41.233 --> 40:43.734
I think I just felt like
you came in, like, full force,

40:43.767 --> 40:45.667
and, like, now my friends are
hanging out with you

40:45.700 --> 40:47.500
instead of me, and I'm like,
who the is this bitch?

40:47.533 --> 40:49.667
Like, I'm sorry. Like,
you've been here two seconds.

40:49.700 --> 40:51.700
You're, like, trying to be
friends with all of my friends.

40:51.734 --> 40:53.700
Now all of my friends are
going to your comedy show.

40:53.734 --> 40:57.266
It's just kind of like,
what are your intentions?

40:57.300 --> 40:59.367
- To make friends
and have a good ----ing life.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.233
That's my intention.
That's who I am.

41:01.266 --> 41:03.066
- It didn't feel that way.
- It feels like you're triggered

41:03.100 --> 41:04.700
that I'm hanging out with Max.
Like, why can't we--

41:04.734 --> 41:09.200
- It just felt so sudden.
- Why can't we all be friends?

41:11.266 --> 41:13.066
- I'm sorry.

41:13.100 --> 41:15.200
It's just like, I've been
so, like, I'm not...

41:15.233 --> 41:17.133
I'm going through all
the freezing eggs

41:17.166 --> 41:19.100
and just hormones
and birth control, whatever.

41:19.133 --> 41:21.233
I've just, like, felt like
I've been pulled

41:21.266 --> 41:23.033
in so many directions.

41:23.066 --> 41:25.300
I have a lot going on right now,
and it's just been, like,

41:25.333 --> 41:28.567
really ----ing overwhelming.
- I have a lot going on, too.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.300
So in addition to that, then I'm
feeling like I have this person

41:31.333 --> 41:33.100
that is, like,
the one person in this group

41:33.133 --> 41:35.300
that I can't seem to get on
the same page with,

41:35.333 --> 41:37.166
even if it's just like,
we'll be cool from a distance.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.066
- I'm not a mean girl.
I'm not a bully.

41:39.100 --> 41:40.367
- I mean,
you're telling me that,

41:40.400 --> 41:42.100
so I always take people
at their word,

41:42.133 --> 41:43.734
but what I've seen so far
has showed me otherwise,

41:43.767 --> 41:46.133
so what my thing is just, like,
don't talk about it.

41:46.166 --> 41:49.066
Be about it.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.200
Cool?
- Yeah.

41:51.233 --> 41:53.667
I haven't been fair to you,
and I'm really sorry.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.233
- Thank you.

41:55.266 --> 41:56.667
♪ Ahh ♪

41:56.700 --> 41:57.667
Finally.

41:57.700 --> 41:58.700
I'm moving on.

41:58.734 --> 42:00.233
- Same.
- Cool.

42:00.266 --> 42:02.100
- I'm gonna say we do a shot,

42:02.133 --> 42:04.300
and then I'm gonna probably glue
this eyelash back on.

42:04.333 --> 42:06.367
- Yeah. Let's go do a shot.
- Okay.

42:09.734 --> 42:12.600
- Next time on...

42:12.633 --> 42:14.767
You disappeared
and didn't come back.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.767
Do not go down
the same path as your boyfriend.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.600
- Don't fire me, please.

42:19.633 --> 42:21.367
- Let's just, like, not hook up
with other people

42:21.400 --> 42:24.166
and, like, focus on each other.
- Yeah, I'm into that.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.734
- I want us to be, I guess,
the word "exclusive."

42:26.767 --> 42:29.100
- Exclusive, yes.
- Yes.

42:29.133 --> 42:32.233
- The guy that is marrying
Jax and Brittany

42:32.266 --> 42:37.166
has made these
incredibly offensive remarks.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.166
- It's not our fault, and I--
- I know it's not our fault.

42:39.200 --> 42:40.700
- And we shouldn't feel bad.
- But I also think all these--

42:40.734 --> 42:43.100
- What's up
with Brittany's pastor?

42:43.133 --> 42:44.734
- Okay, when it first comes out,
that's when you kind of, like,

42:44.767 --> 42:48.033
have to, like, oh, well, maybe
I should look into this.

42:48.066 --> 42:51.000
- I'm wondering, like, why it
took Lisa coming to you guys

42:51.033 --> 42:52.066
about this guy?
- No, no, no.

42:52.100 --> 42:53.333
I'm not talking about this.

42:53.367 --> 42:55.367
- I did nothing wrong!
you!

42:55.400 --> 42:57.700
- He can't have an opinion?
- Yeah, no, he can't!

42:57.734 --> 42:59.200
- Two weeks before my wedding.

42:59.233 --> 43:01.266
I hope Jax knocks him out.

43:01.300 --> 43:03.066
Knock him the out.

43:03.100 --> 43:04.433
