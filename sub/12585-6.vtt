00:36.578 --> 00:39.164
Have you guys seen my graphing calculator?

00:39.247 --> 00:41.416
I'll look like a dork
at math camp without it.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.752
You not going to math
camp this spring break.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.546
If you want to get into top-
notch private high school,

00:46.629 --> 00:50.008
you need to have interesting
job on your résumé.

00:50.091 --> 00:50.925
You're going to work

00:51.009 --> 00:53.011
on my cousin Trang's squid boat next week.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.014
I don't understand.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.641
Admissions people are very educated,

00:58.725 --> 01:00.518
and educated people like to hear

01:00.602 --> 01:03.146
about the kind of jobs
uneducated people have.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.523
Disgusting squid boat perfect for you.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.817
Since I want to go into journalism,

01:07.901 --> 01:11.946
shouldn't I shadow a journalist
like Mrs. Hill or Mrs. Gribble?

01:12.030 --> 01:14.240
That not bad idea, but unfortunately

01:14.324 --> 01:16.576
I call Nancy Gribble
a pumpkin-headed Q-Tip.

01:16.659 --> 01:20.330
And I called Peggy Hill
a dim-witted sea cow.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.581
What we're saying is,

01:21.664 --> 01:23.875
if you can get one of them
to go along with you,

01:23.958 --> 01:25.126
more power to you.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.503
Otherwise, squid boat.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.420
Squid boat!

01:30.799 --> 01:32.467
I could learn so much

01:32.550 --> 01:35.178
from a professional journalist
like Mrs. Hicks-Gribble.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.596
You want to follow Nancy?

01:36.679 --> 01:38.389
Oh, please.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.351
You should follow a serious
journalist, such as myself.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.394
Print media is where it's at.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.980
Did you know it's where most
people used to get their news?

01:46.064 --> 01:47.190
That's a good point,

01:47.273 --> 01:50.318
but Mrs. Gribble promised me
some on-screen time.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.529
Okay, let's just cut to the chase.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.280
I will guarantee a shared byline

01:54.364 --> 01:56.407
on page one above the fold.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.453
Oh, this is gonna be exciting!

02:00.537 --> 02:02.664
Sorry, I'm late. I was, uh...

02:02.747 --> 02:05.500
Spare us your minor domestic dramas.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.294
I give you a complete, barely used set

02:08.378 --> 02:11.464
of state-of-the-art titanium golf clubs,

02:11.548 --> 02:15.301
made from technology first
imagined by Jules Verne.

02:16.594 --> 02:17.971
These are for me?

02:18.054 --> 02:19.472
Well, how could you afford 'em?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.641
I assure you they were paid for in full

02:21.724 --> 02:24.394
and they are yours to enjoy
with no strings attached.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.689
Just consider it my way
of saying "I'm sorry."

02:27.772 --> 02:29.149
Sorry for what?

02:29.232 --> 02:30.525
Oh, you'll know.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.193
Dale, what are you up to?

02:32.277 --> 02:33.903
No more questions!

02:33.987 --> 02:36.156
Just, just, just take a club
in your hands and hold it!

02:36.239 --> 02:37.949
Hold it! All right, already.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.953
Oh, my Lord.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.457
All right, people,
we got a weekly to put out.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.251
Stenholm, you've got the police blotter.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.086
We call that "Drunks and Punks."

02:50.170 --> 02:52.130
Jenkins, you're on the County
Commission meeting.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.840
Oh.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.593
"Bores and Snores."

02:56.676 --> 02:57.927
Peggy, you've got a profile

02:58.011 --> 03:00.180
of Arlen real estate guru Chris Sizemore.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.391
Sizemore's office faxed
the story over this morning.

03:03.474 --> 03:06.978
Just throw in a few sexy
adjectives, but not too sexy.

03:07.061 --> 03:10.440
I will Helen Hunt it.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.109
So this is all you do, just
write what they tell you?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.736
Of course not.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.572
Sometimes I, I get to come up
with the headline.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.157
Not this time, apparently.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.910
I need more than some dictated puff piece

03:21.993 --> 03:24.204
to get me into the school of my choice.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.664
This Sizemore guy might seem great,

03:26.748 --> 03:29.000
but under that smarmy smile,

03:29.083 --> 03:31.920
I bet there's a big, ugly story.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.630
Yes, you're right.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.048
He's like that dish of mints

03:35.131 --> 03:37.217
by the cash register at the restaurant.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.178
Sure, they look tasty,
but they are covered in urine.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.387
Eww...

03:41.471 --> 03:42.513
Exactly.

03:46.684 --> 03:49.145
I am Peggy Hill from the <i>Arlen Bystander.</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:50.980
You are going to love Chris.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.690
Don't tell me what to write.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.733
I still remember

03:53.816 --> 03:55.026
the first time I met Chris.

03:55.109 --> 03:56.569
When he shook my hand and smiled,

03:56.653 --> 03:58.947
I felt like I was under a tanning lamp.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.282
And then he invited me
into his office, and I was.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.453
Mr. Sizemore,

04:05.536 --> 04:06.913
you say your life

04:06.996 --> 04:08.248
is an open book.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.999
How do you explain this pregnancy test

04:10.083 --> 04:12.001
I found in the trash behind your house?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.253
My wife is pregnant.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.545
Congratulations.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.469
Yes. So. On one of your billboards

04:21.552 --> 04:24.472
you appear to be a giant
standing over Arlen.

04:24.555 --> 04:27.267
Clearly, you are a man of average size.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.478
Simple mistake... or false advertising?

04:30.561 --> 04:32.689
Oh, Peggy, there's nothing I enjoy more

04:32.772 --> 04:35.566
than lining my pieces up
against a worthy adversary,

04:35.650 --> 04:39.279
but I got where I am today by
always being six moves ahead.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.197
Just when you think you have me cornered,

04:41.281 --> 04:43.992
I jump, jump, double jump
and I'm in your back row.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.368
"King me."

04:45.451 --> 04:47.328
Are you saying the interview is over?

04:47.412 --> 04:49.497
It was over six moves ago.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.291
We'll see about that.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.089
-Oh!
-Ooh!

04:58.172 --> 04:59.590
Wow.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.467
I've never seen you play this well before.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.845
Except in that dream I had
where you won the Masters

05:03.928 --> 05:05.346
in a playoff with a robot.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.931
Well, it's these clubs.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.559
It's like they're an extension of my arms.

05:09.642 --> 05:13.271
Well, they ought to be.
They MSRP for $3,000.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.189
How in the world did you get these?

05:15.273 --> 05:16.983
They better not be hot.

05:17.066 --> 05:20.737
No, but they do have
an interesting provenance.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.196
Dale got 'em at a police auction!

05:22.280 --> 05:24.240
These clubs were owned by a criminal?!

05:24.324 --> 05:25.783
Not only that, they were used

05:25.867 --> 05:27.827
in a horrible murder in McMaynerbury.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.871
No! No!

05:29.954 --> 05:31.497
Not the orthopedic surgeon

05:31.581 --> 05:34.167
who killed the embezzling
partner in his practice.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.253
None other than Texas's newest
resident of Death Row,

05:37.337 --> 05:39.505
Dr. James Allan Duckworth.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.508
I can't use clubs convicted of murder.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.345
Only one of the clubs
was used in the murder.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.764
The rest were merely murder-adjacent.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.099
Was it the putter?

05:50.183 --> 05:52.435
You shot a 38 on the front nine.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.020
Do you really want to know?

05:55.563 --> 05:56.856
No.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.700
Where's your teenie-weenie sidekick?

06:07.784 --> 06:10.620
She is doing research for my next article.

06:10.703 --> 06:13.664
We are gonna blow the lid off
Arlen's Auto Cartel,

06:13.748 --> 06:15.917
just like we did to Chris Sizemore.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.087
Peggy! A word.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.963
I just got off the phone
with Chris Sizemore.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.215
He's out for blood.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.509
Well, that just means I did my job.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.302
Why are you acting surprised?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.388
Didn't you read the article
when I submitted it?

06:28.471 --> 06:30.932
No, I read the press release
they faxed over.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.975
That's the story I thought we printed,

06:33.059 --> 06:35.228
not this hatchet job on one
of our biggest advertisers.

06:35.311 --> 06:38.272
Peggy, you said "the scented candles

06:38.356 --> 06:41.526
made his office reek like a bordello."

06:41.609 --> 06:44.320
But then I wrote
that there was no visible proof

06:44.404 --> 06:46.280
he used prostitutes himself.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.366
Peggy, you're fired.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.751
You.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.128
Yes, me.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.712
Peggy, it took a lot of courage

07:01.796 --> 07:03.798
for you to take me on, and I respect that.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.676
I only regret I didn't
make my article nastier.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.928
I understand. You're angry.

07:09.011 --> 07:11.097
But you're something else
that ends with "gry."

07:11.180 --> 07:12.223
Hungry.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.477
You know, Peggy, you remind me of me...

07:16.561 --> 07:18.813
just a little, because
you've got so much to learn.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.440
But I like your moxie.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.441
You're hired.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.568
But... you just had me fired.

07:23.651 --> 07:24.819
I closed a door...

07:24.902 --> 07:26.154
and opened a window.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.572
Welcome to Team Sizemore.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.245
Ho yeah!

07:35.204 --> 07:36.998
I tracked down a lead
at Lane Pratley Cadillac

07:37.081 --> 07:38.541
who's ready to squawk.

07:38.624 --> 07:39.876
Forget it.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.752
Something fantastic has happened.

07:42.420 --> 07:46.424
I was fired, and now we're Realtors!

07:50.386 --> 07:54.807
I need a byline in a newspaper
to prove I'm a good journalist.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.851
I need to blow the lid off something,

07:56.934 --> 07:59.812
not tease my hair
and put on a stupid blazer!

07:59.896 --> 08:02.482
Oh, real estate is so much more than that.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.817
It drives the whole U.S. economy

08:04.901 --> 08:07.904
and the U.S. economy
drives the entire world.

08:07.987 --> 08:11.991
So, in a very real way, this is
the most important job on earth.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.034
Wow.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.285
Yeah, wow.

08:14.368 --> 08:15.661
And you know what is even better?

08:15.745 --> 08:17.747
That you are gonna be the youngest person

08:17.830 --> 08:19.040
to have ever sold a house.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.500
Really?

08:20.583 --> 08:22.335
That would sound good on an application.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.295
Sold!

08:24.962 --> 08:27.173
<i>I've always wondered...</i>

08:27.256 --> 08:30.176
does a half-bath mean
you only get to pee in it?

08:30.259 --> 08:32.261
Now that I'm a Realtor, I will find out.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.138
Now, I'm confused.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.266
You hated Sizemore even though
there wasn't any reason to.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.102
Now that he got you fired and
you have a reason to hate him,

08:40.186 --> 08:41.312
you're working for him.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.981
Chris Sizemore saw potential in me,

08:44.065 --> 08:45.399
and I know he is right.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.068
I know houses.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.736
I live in one.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.947
You know the feeling you
get when you sell someone

08:51.030 --> 08:52.156
a tank of propane?

08:53.241 --> 08:54.867
Imagine selling them

08:54.951 --> 08:56.035
a tank of propane

08:56.118 --> 08:58.454
they will live in for 30 years fixed.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.039
I'll tell you what.

09:00.122 --> 09:02.083
Once you get a magnet
with your picture on it,

09:02.166 --> 09:05.503
I'll get rid of my no-magnets-
on-the-refrigerator rule.

09:08.881 --> 09:09.840
Peggy!

09:09.924 --> 09:11.592
Welcome to Team Sizemore.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.052
Thank you.

09:13.135 --> 09:16.430
Uh... I can't hire the little Asian girl.

09:16.514 --> 09:17.765
The Texas Real Estate Commission

09:17.848 --> 09:20.059
is a grouchy Gus about child labor.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.978
Oh, Connie is just my protégé.

09:22.061 --> 09:22.937
She's free.

09:23.020 --> 09:23.854
Perfect.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.440
Well, then, Peggy,
I'd like you and your protégé

09:26.524 --> 09:27.984
to meet the rest of Team Sizemore.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.112
This is Dee. She coined the word "cozy"

09:31.195 --> 09:33.239
for uncomfortably small places.

09:33.322 --> 09:34.448
And over there

09:34.532 --> 09:35.366
is Walker Lee.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.742
He can nail the square footage

09:36.826 --> 09:38.160
of a house just by walking it.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.121
Thanks to my size 12s!

09:40.204 --> 09:41.789
And I believe

09:41.872 --> 09:43.416
you've already met Candi and Roger.

09:43.499 --> 09:45.167
That's Candi with an "I."

09:45.251 --> 09:47.211
And Roger with an "I do."

09:48.504 --> 09:49.505
Candi and I are married.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.048
Since I married Candi and Roger,

09:51.132 --> 09:52.967
our sales are up 27%.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.344
So they're not really married?

09:55.428 --> 09:56.429
Well, not to each other.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.389
But I'm afraid they're stuck
with one another

09:58.472 --> 09:59.849
till their sales drop.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.690
Seriously, though,
we here at Team Sizemore

10:07.773 --> 10:09.150
succeed because we work together

10:09.233 --> 10:11.152
like a highly functioning human body.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.154
A human body, yes.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.947
Peggy, would you like to be an organ?

10:15.031 --> 10:15.990
Yes, the brain.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.909
That one's taken.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.494
Oh. What about the skin?

10:20.578 --> 10:22.413
People don't realize that is an organ.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.665
Super. We have six open
houses this weekend.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.709
I need you to help get them ready to show.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.461
And you can start by baking

10:28.544 --> 10:31.047
the most scrumptious 36 dozen
cookies you've ever baked.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.548
Cookies?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.800
Really delicious cookies
increase sales 7%.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.351
I don't think we can bake
a cookie good enough

10:43.434 --> 10:45.478
to make someone sink their life savings

10:45.561 --> 10:47.188
into a house they can't afford.

10:47.271 --> 10:50.107
Chris says his ideas may seem crazy,

10:50.191 --> 10:51.859
like Howard Hughes toward the end,

10:51.942 --> 10:53.194
but they're actually crazy

10:53.277 --> 10:55.029
like Howard Hughes towards the middle.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.698
I like the sound of this Sizemore guy.

10:57.782 --> 11:00.368
Any friend of the cookie
is a friend of mine.

11:00.451 --> 11:01.285
Hey!

11:06.415 --> 11:07.833
You the man!

11:10.378 --> 11:13.714
How could clubs that feel
so right, feel so wrong?

11:13.798 --> 11:15.883
Those clubs don't care
whether they're striking

11:15.966 --> 11:18.969
a Titleist or Dr. Ted Nelson's skull.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.346
And neither should you.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.223
You know, I could use a guilt-free hole.

11:22.306 --> 11:25.142
Would one of you guys like to
take a swing with these clubs?

11:25.226 --> 11:26.310
No, sir. No.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.813
No. Ain't no got dang ol' way, man.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.320
Mm. Scrumptious.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.114
Now, have you touched up

11:38.197 --> 11:40.157
the dog pee spots in the backyard

11:40.241 --> 11:41.909
with green spray paint? Check.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.953
Copied names and addresses
from the phone book

11:44.036 --> 11:45.579
to "prime" the guest book?

11:45.663 --> 11:46.872
Check.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.624
Checked out the Ahn-sel Adams book

11:48.708 --> 11:50.960
from the library to put on
the living room coffee table?

11:51.043 --> 11:55.089
It's all covered.
Now all I need to do is sell this sucker.

11:55.172 --> 11:57.049
Oh, Walker Lee is going to sell this one.

11:58.467 --> 12:02.221
Dee, we need some conversation
pieces for the house on Ben.

12:02.304 --> 12:05.182
I just got a premonition that
big things suspended

12:05.266 --> 12:06.642
from the ceiling are gonna be hot,

12:06.726 --> 12:09.895
so bring me something metal,
heavy and fantastic.

12:09.979 --> 12:13.649
I just saw the most exquisite <i>objet d'art</i>.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.485
Peggy, meet me at the dump. Excellent.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.697
Uh, but before that, Peggy,
I need you to brush my teeth.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.705
To the dump.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.586
What about that anchor?

12:33.711 --> 12:36.130
It's heavy, metal,
I think it's pretty good.

12:36.213 --> 12:40.092
Nautical? You're so naive
it's almost cute...

12:40.176 --> 12:41.302
but not quite.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.845
Grab the rusty propeller.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.975
Fabulous. I'm on it.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.060
Get this to the office, chop-chop.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.605
No offense.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.028
Yee-ow!

13:00.112 --> 13:03.073
<i>Champagnoise </i>at 9:00 in the
morning can only mean one thing.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.160
A big sale.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.995
Congratulations to all of us.

13:08.078 --> 13:13.542
To Candi and Roger and Walker
Lee and Dee and Janet and me.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.461
The vital organs of Team Sizemore.

13:15.544 --> 13:18.172
King me. Cheers to the king.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.591
He thanked everybody but us.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.551
Maybe he just forgot.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.345
People are always forgetting the skin.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.764
Oh, and thanks to the Sparkletts guy!

13:28.224 --> 13:31.435
How could we have done our jobs
if we weren't properly hydrated?

13:34.897 --> 13:37.191
Another "Sizemore Says",

13:37.274 --> 13:41.195
Sizemore says you have a pot
of gold at the end of your neck.

13:41.278 --> 13:43.322
Your face. Get it out there.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.407
Chris, do you have a minute?

13:45.491 --> 13:46.826
Oh, hi, Peggy.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.577
Just mining diamonds. What's up?

13:48.661 --> 13:52.164
Chris, I know I have talents
that aren't being utilized.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.917
I can do more here. I'm ready.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.545
Oh, Peggy, I would have thought
you were ready,

13:57.628 --> 13:59.713
except you <i>told</i> me you were ready.

13:59.797 --> 14:00.923
Damn.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.258
Don't worry, Peggy.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.843
When you're ready, you'll know.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.344
Because I will have just told you.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.270
What did he say?

14:14.353 --> 14:17.439
A lot of very wise things
that all seem to mean no.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.899
Dang it, Mrs. Hill.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.610
I've seen the test scores for Arlen High.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.321
If I have to go there, my only
options will be DeVry

14:24.405 --> 14:25.990
or the University of Phoenix.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.075
Which one, Mrs. Hill?!

14:28.158 --> 14:32.246
On the radio, they both sound
like good institutions, but...

14:32.329 --> 14:34.623
Okay, I'm gonna fix this.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.834
I shouldn't have told Chris I was ready.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.836
I should have proved it.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.173
That's the reason you
hired me in the first place.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.341
My moxie.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.344
Well, using that moxie
to "get my face out there."

14:52.182 --> 14:56.478
This is Nancy Hicks-Gribble's
<i>Arlen Business Journal.</i>

14:56.562 --> 15:00.065
Today we're talking with
Peggy Hill from Sizemore Realty.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.525
Team Sizemore is one of Arlen's

15:01.609 --> 15:03.569
greatest business success stories.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.321
It most certainly is.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.406
It all starts with Chris, of course.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.242
The man is brilliant and charismatic.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.202
He could lead any cult he wanted to.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.537
He chose real estate.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.707
What makes Team Sizemore so successful

15:16.832 --> 15:19.209
is that we're like a human body

15:19.293 --> 15:20.961
with all the parts working together

15:21.045 --> 15:23.422
in harmony to sell houses.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.382
Oh, that is fascinating.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.426
Chris, naturally, is the brain.

15:27.509 --> 15:28.844
And what are you, Peggy?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.221
I am the face.

15:35.851 --> 15:38.270
Did you think I wouldn't see this?

15:38.354 --> 15:40.105
I knew you would see it.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.067
That was the point,
to get my face out there.

15:43.150 --> 15:46.070
Just like you said,
my face is a pot of gold.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.530
No, my face is a pot of gold.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.200
Look, face, gold, neck,
they're all metaphors.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.994
I am the boss, and you do
what I say when I say it.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.871
You crossed the line, Peggy.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.414
You weren't a team player.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.166
So you're off Team Sizemore.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.252
But you like my moxie. That was all moxie.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.004
Sorry, Peggy. You're fired.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.298
No... no.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.426
I'm going to be a dental technologist.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.057
<i>Fired from the</i> Bystander,

16:15.140 --> 16:17.434
fired from Sizemore Realty.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.436
Bobby, check the <i>Guinness World Records</i>

16:19.520 --> 16:22.147
and see who holds the one for
being fired the most times.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.400
I'm pretty sure, it's George Jetson.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.235
Well, don't take it so hard.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.653
Maybe you're better off

16:27.736 --> 16:29.905
not working for this Chris Sizemore fella.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.824
You don't understand.

16:31.907 --> 16:35.285
Real estate was my passion,
and now it's gone.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.413
Now I know what it's like to smoke crack.

16:37.496 --> 16:40.791
I took one hit of real estate
and it blew off my skull.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.213
Yeah, I know what you mean.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.013
Hey, Mrs. Hill.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.973
I just wanted to give your blazer back.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.100
Oh, Connie, why don't you keep it?

16:58.183 --> 17:01.687
No, thanks. I don't think it'll
keep me warm on the squid boat.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.981
My cousin's coming in
this weekend to re-chum

17:04.064 --> 17:06.400
and I'm hoping he'll let me crew up.

17:09.486 --> 17:12.448
Connie, I cannot let you give up.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.283
Which means I can't give up.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.076
We are going to sell a house

17:16.160 --> 17:17.995
and you are getting into private school.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.941
I wonder if the murderer

17:48.067 --> 17:50.694
took a practice swing
before doing the deed.

17:50.778 --> 17:53.572
The temptation to yell "Fore!"
must have been overwhelming.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.033
Dang it, Dale, I don't think
you gave me these clubs

17:56.116 --> 17:57.701
to apologize for anything.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.245
You gave them to me to torture me.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.164
Well, I'm not gonna play
with them any more

18:02.247 --> 18:04.249
until I've cleared their name.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.587
<i>So you didn't kill that fella</i>

18:08.670 --> 18:10.589
with any of these golf clubs, right?

18:10.672 --> 18:11.632
No.

18:11.715 --> 18:12.883
Okay then.

18:25.395 --> 18:29.525
Well, I do like the anchor.
I think we need more room.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.026
We want to start a family.

18:33.195 --> 18:36.198
Wait a second... you're adopting?

18:36.281 --> 18:38.242
I adopted, too!

18:40.953 --> 18:43.831
It's so great that you go
to work with your mom.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.501
Mom is really terrific.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.504
Connie loves this place.

18:50.587 --> 18:52.589
When her real parents
abandoned her in a ditch,

18:52.673 --> 18:55.384
all she wanted was to be adopted

18:55.467 --> 18:57.594
and live in a house with
a center island kitchen.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.894
Connie, why don't you show Wang and Jeff

19:05.978 --> 19:07.521
where you'd put a swing set.

19:07.604 --> 19:08.772
Yes, Mom.

19:12.109 --> 19:15.279
An adopted Asian daughter. Brilliant.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.989
I wish I had thought of that.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.949
Done. Candi and Roger are adopting.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.784
I told you I had talent.

19:24.079 --> 19:26.456
You've really done your homework, Peggy.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.667
Except for one little thing...

19:28.750 --> 19:30.460
you don't have a real estate license.

19:30.544 --> 19:33.964
All it takes is 150 hours.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.924
And I've already signed up online.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.011
What's to keep me from calling
the Texas Real Estate Commission

19:39.094 --> 19:40.846
as soon as I get back in my hybrid?

19:40.929 --> 19:42.931
I don't know. Maybe nothing.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.350
I'll tell you what's keeping
me from making that call.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.476
Respect.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.853
I knew I'd find you here.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.522
I knew you'd even steal my best bus bench.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.108
And I know you'll sell this house

19:53.192 --> 19:55.485
to those cosmopolitan gentlemen
at above-asking price.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.237
I know you because I made you.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.488
The question is,

19:58.572 --> 20:00.157
"Am I going to break you?"

20:00.240 --> 20:03.327
Go ahead, do what you have to do.

20:10.834 --> 20:14.546
Peggy, you and I can
take on more than Arlen,

20:14.630 --> 20:16.381
and more than Heimlich County.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.925
I'm not gonna make that call.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.426
On one condition.

20:19.509 --> 20:22.804
Team Peggy merges forces
with Team Sizemore.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.765
We'll call it Team Sizemore.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.099
I accept.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.267
On one condition.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.019
That I get to sell.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.313
Starting with this house. Granted.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.565
And I get to keep the bus bench.

20:33.649 --> 20:34.650
Denied.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.109
Then in the print ad

20:36.193 --> 20:37.986
I am the first member of Team Sizemore

20:38.070 --> 20:40.280
to pour out of the cornucopia.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.532
Ooh, that's going to tick off Walker Lee.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.618
But motivate him as well. Done.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.414
King me.

20:50.707 --> 20:52.417
King me.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.254
King me.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.257
Who else besides Bill didn't bring tees?

20:58.340 --> 20:59.299
Me!

21:03.053 --> 21:03.971
Huh.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.726
Well, Duckworth must have been a skier.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.772
<i>Squid boat.</i><i>Squid boat!</i>
