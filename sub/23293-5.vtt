00:05.920 --> 00:08.320
-"I’m waiting for instructions.
-I have a shot at the kidnapper."

00:08.400 --> 00:11.160
-What the fuck are you doing?
-There are fucking snipers.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.000
-On your knees.
-"They’re aiming."

00:13.680 --> 00:15.680
-Give me the green light.
-"They’re going to execute them.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.680
-They’re going to shoot.
-I request to open fire."

00:17.760 --> 00:18.600
Put down the gun!

00:19.560 --> 00:20.720
"They’re going to kill them."

00:21.240 --> 00:22.080
Green light.

00:22.840 --> 00:25.080
-Condor 3, open fire.
-Behind you.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.680
SATURDAY
06:00 PM

01:52.600 --> 01:55.320
Good! Good, Mr Torres. Good. Very good.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.680
But now let’s change the series, okay?

01:57.960 --> 01:59.920
Let’s change the letter, all right?

02:00.080 --> 02:02.080
Another country, yes.
Don’t complain. Come on.

02:07.480 --> 02:09.800
Helsinki! Come down, hurry up.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.440
-What have we got?
-He’s seriously injured. Hurry up!

02:12.760 --> 02:15.600
You killed her, motherfuckers.

02:58.800 --> 02:59.640
Hurry up.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.720
Water, water, please.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.480
Water, please. Water.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.240
Thanks. Arturo, hold on tight. Rio, Rio!

03:26.440 --> 03:27.680
Alcohol, alcohol.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.680
I need you to take your hand off...

03:31.720 --> 03:32.560
-Raquel.

03:32.640 --> 03:34.760
"Ex-employees of the paper money factory

03:34.840 --> 03:38.120
have revealed the identity
of the man hurt by the police.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.920
It’s Arturo Román,
the general manager of the factory,

03:41.000 --> 03:44.280
who has just been hurt
by the police forces,

03:44.560 --> 03:47.360
while he was on the roof with the robbers.

03:47.920 --> 03:51.600
The events took place after 32 hours
since the beginning of the kidnapping."

03:52.520 --> 03:55.200
32 HOURS OF ROBBERY

03:57.200 --> 03:59.200
I need to talk to my wife, please.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.480
I need to talk to my wife.

04:01.760 --> 04:05.280
"They say that when we’re at Death’s door

04:05.720 --> 04:08.280
we’re finally able to see
our life with clarity.

04:08.880 --> 04:12.000
And Arturo Román, losing blood on a table,

04:12.240 --> 04:16.080
was waiting for that:
Death’s clairvoyance.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.520
To find out once and for all
who the love of his life had been.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.320
Laura, the woman with whom
he had shared 14 years

04:24.480 --> 04:26.320
of holy matrimony?

04:27.280 --> 04:29.800
Or Mónica, his secretary and lover,

04:29.880 --> 04:32.240
with whom he had felt young again?

04:32.880 --> 04:35.640
Unfortunately, the only certainty
Arturo had at that moment

04:35.720 --> 04:37.760
was that, if they didn’t take out
the bullet,

04:38.200 --> 04:40.520
he’d kick the bucket
before solving the enigma.

04:41.440 --> 04:45.800
And, frankly, our first aid courses
weren’t a guarantee for living."

04:46.840 --> 04:48.080
Inferior cava.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.480
Right renal.

04:51.480 --> 04:52.320
Left.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.160
Mesenteric.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.440
Right pulmonary.

04:56.960 --> 04:57.800
Left.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.480
This is the heart.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.600
Cava.

05:01.160 --> 05:05.080
Subclavian, right and left.

05:05.960 --> 05:06.840
Brachial.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.080
Humeral.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.680
Internal jugular.

05:13.320 --> 05:14.680
External jugular.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.360
And in red the main arteries.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.240
Hey, stop, stop.

05:19.760 --> 05:20.680
Let’s see.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.040
Do you want us to learn medicine
this way, with two markers?

05:24.240 --> 05:26.480
If anyone is shot,
he can’t go to a hospital.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.360
You have to manage inside.

05:28.640 --> 05:30.680
-It’ll be fucking suicide.
-Shut the fuck up.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.760
One thing is
to lock ourselves up in that mouse trap.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.760
-Another thing would be that we die.
-Denver.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.720
We’re asking you to learn
how to take out a bullet.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.360
Don’t start
with "the epic tales about the outskirts".

05:40.440 --> 05:41.640
It’s not that hard.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.120
You get the pliers, take out the bullet
without screwing it up.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.240
-That’s all.
-The shot already screwed it up.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.120
If they shoot me, take me to the hospital.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.760
The answer is "no."

05:49.880 --> 05:51.760
Well, I prefer being lame and free

05:51.840 --> 05:54.040
rather than with excellent health
but in a cell.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.160
Nobody will go out.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.400
Anyone of you is a clue
and a thread that can be pulled.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.280
If somebody wants to resign,
this is the moment.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.240
He will stay here during the robbery
and then he’ll leave.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.800
Will the lesson last long?

06:08.560 --> 06:10.680
My willy is shrinking like Helsinki’s.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.760
Hey! What did you say about my willy?

06:14.920 --> 06:17.640
-Enough. Enough.
-Do you want to see my willy?

06:17.720 --> 06:18.760
Please.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.240
Come on, get dressed.
Let another one lie here, please.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.400
-Mr Willy.
-Come on.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.480
Come on.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.320
-No? No, no...
-Well, there we go.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.640
-Well...
-Come on, Nairobi.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.480
-It’s all right, isn’t it?
-Come on, Nairobi!

06:32.560 --> 06:33.960
So sexy!

06:34.600 --> 06:36.760
-She’s black.
-Sexy, sexy.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.600
-Go on.
-Wow! Okay.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.680
Let’s see what you learnt.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.960
This is the carotid...

06:42.240 --> 06:44.960
"And so, playing doctors,

06:45.280 --> 06:48.000
I found out Nairobi was
more interesting than she seemed."

06:48.320 --> 06:49.160
The heart.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.160
The aorta...

06:52.560 --> 06:54.440
"And, although nobody knew anything
about anyone,..."

06:54.520 --> 06:55.440
The abdominal aorta.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.080
"...what I never had suspected
was that Nairobi had a son.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.800
Or a daughter.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.200
As it seemed by her C-section scar."

07:03.280 --> 07:05.240
-What are you doing? What are you doing?
-Hey, hey!

07:05.320 --> 07:06.520
-Where are you going?
-What’s up?

07:06.600 --> 07:07.600
What are you looking at?

07:07.680 --> 07:08.520
-What’s up?
-Calm down.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.000
No. You’re going to eat that marker.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.880
-What’s up?
-She’s a bit of a lesbian.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.960
Don’t know what the fuck she’s looking at.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.920
You’re the lesbian. Your nugget
was as hard as a sugar cube.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.440
As a sugar cube? I’m going to...

07:19.480 --> 07:20.320
Stop it!

07:20.520 --> 07:22.960
"And that’s where our friendship started."

08:39.640 --> 08:40.880
Raquel, the Ministry on the phone.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.960
What shall I tell them?
Raquel? What shall I say?

08:43.040 --> 08:45.160
-Raquel! What shall I say?
-Pardon?

08:45.360 --> 08:48.360
-They’ll ask who gave the order.
-I gave the order.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.440
Tell them... the wounded man is a hostage.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.400
-And hang up the fucking phone!
-He looked like a robber.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.160
I asked for the green light. I insisted.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.800
Inspector, I assume
responsibility with you.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.800
Inspector, the ambulance is ready.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.040
Let’s talk to the kidnapper.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.960
"Preparing the communication
with the kidnapper."

09:11.480 --> 09:13.640
We had to make a decision. They were...

09:13.720 --> 09:16.560
It seemed they’d execute them,
we had to decide, there was no time.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.920
Silence, please!

09:45.840 --> 09:46.680
Professor?

09:47.320 --> 09:49.040
"You fired upon the hostages.

09:49.280 --> 09:52.400
One is between life and death.
I guess that’s why you’re calling."

09:52.480 --> 09:54.280
I’ve got the ambulance
to evacuate the injured man.

09:54.720 --> 09:55.880
Nobody’s getting out of here.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.880
-That man is bleeding out.
-"Due to the bullet you shot."

10:00.520 --> 10:01.800
Will you let him die?

10:04.360 --> 10:06.200
"Let me get a medical team there."

10:10.720 --> 10:12.680
Professor, listen.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.960
I know it was my mistake,

10:16.480 --> 10:20.400
"but if a hostage dies,
it’ll be as awful for you as for me.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.160
Believe me, in less"

10:22.320 --> 10:25.080
than five minutes
public opinion will know that

10:25.240 --> 10:26.320
that man died

10:26.400 --> 10:29.000
because you didn’t let us
come in and save his life.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.120
"Two surgeons and a nurse
with surgical equipment.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.560
-Let me know when they arrive."
-Thanks.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.760
"I also have something to ask you."

10:50.120 --> 10:51.920
The injured man wants to talk to his wife.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.240
Of course.

10:54.640 --> 10:55.560
Jesus.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.160
Locate Mr Román’s wife.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.040
When can the medical team be here?

11:01.120 --> 11:03.680
By helicopter from La Paz,
10 or 15 minutes.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.880
-Bring them here. Now!
-Okay.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.040
Places everyone, come on.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.560
Please, places everyone.

12:09.920 --> 12:10.760
Excuse me.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.720
Can you drive?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.240
Yes, yes.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.200
I need to get out of here, go for a drive.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.600
-Yes.
-Thanks.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.800
Hey, Raquel.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.240
What’s up?

12:26.760 --> 12:28.000
I have to think.

12:40.120 --> 12:41.000
Drive.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.760
Don’t look at me like that.
I’m not leaving you alone.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.600
Where the fuck is she?

13:17.080 --> 13:18.400
That bitch has escaped!

13:27.000 --> 13:28.160
Let’s see...

13:31.160 --> 13:32.160
I’m coming.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.520
There we go.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.200
Tell me, my child.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.280
"Will you be able to come here tonight?"

13:42.360 --> 13:45.440
-I don’t know, mum.
-"But why? What’s the matter?"

13:47.800 --> 13:49.200
Mum, it’s...

13:50.320 --> 13:51.200
I’m...

13:52.360 --> 13:53.240
I made

13:53.320 --> 13:54.840
"a very big mistake at work."

13:54.920 --> 13:57.760
My child, your work is very difficult.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.680
"Come on, tell me, there’s nothing"

14:00.840 --> 14:03.440
that still seems so serious
five minutes after being told.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.640
I was drinking wine with...

14:07.720 --> 14:09.320
"I like that. With who?"

14:09.760 --> 14:10.600
Do I know him?

14:10.760 --> 14:13.560
No, mum. I don’t know him either.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.480
The thing is...
When I came back to the tent,

14:17.560 --> 14:19.160
there was a very serious situation,

14:20.040 --> 14:23.200
"a risky one,
on the roof of the factory and...

14:23.760 --> 14:25.800
I thought one of the hostages
was in danger,"

14:25.880 --> 14:27.240
so I gave...

14:27.640 --> 14:29.040
the order to open fire.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.240
And an innocent man was shot.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.280
-Yes. I’ve seen it on TV, my child.
-"Now I don’t know what to do."

14:37.240 --> 14:39.800
I don’t know whether to phone his wife,

14:40.160 --> 14:44.360
give a press conference, resign...
I don’t know what to do, mum.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.920
Well, first of all, relax
and don’t blame yourself.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.600
"They’re there with masks and guns,"

14:51.920 --> 14:53.720
locked up, all jumbled up.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.280
You only wanted
to protect the hostages, right?

14:58.240 --> 15:00.760
"Honey... What if you had saved
somebody’s life?"

15:00.960 --> 15:04.440
What? You wouldn’t be phoning me, right?

15:04.640 --> 15:05.520
"Well...,

15:06.040 --> 15:07.640
and now I..."

15:07.920 --> 15:10.600
wouldn’t know that you meet strangers

15:11.080 --> 15:12.400
"and have a drink with them."

15:13.280 --> 15:16.320
God! I... I don’t meet strangers.

15:17.440 --> 15:20.320
My child, we have
so little time in this life...

15:21.720 --> 15:24.040
Okay, mum,
but that’s not the question now.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.720
The question is I’m
in a critical situation at work.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.040
Honey, send that work to hell.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.520
"Why don’t you tell them
you want to stamp passports?

15:31.600 --> 15:33.760
This way you may have some fun. Heavens!"

15:33.840 --> 15:37.040
"Or do you think in the future you’ll be
holding hands with the kidnapper"

15:37.120 --> 15:39.160
in an old people’s home?
You won’t, my child.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.600
But maybe with that stranger...

15:44.480 --> 15:48.480
"Don’t laugh, I know
what I’m talking about. I’ve been..."

15:48.640 --> 15:50.120
a widow for 20 years and...

15:53.080 --> 15:54.760
Time doesn’t stop, my child.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.640
And it doesn’t go back either, you know?

15:58.080 --> 16:01.240
-Getting in the perimeter.
-I’ll think about it, mum.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.160
If you see it’s late, go to bed,
all right?

16:04.320 --> 16:05.200
Fine.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.000
Listen and you go to bed

16:07.160 --> 16:08.360
"with someone too."

16:16.800 --> 16:20.000
RACHEL LIKES A STRANGER

16:32.720 --> 16:35.800
-What the fuck do you want?
-I don’t know. I saw that earlier and...

16:37.280 --> 16:38.600
And it drew my attention.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.040
I didn’t know what it was.

16:41.680 --> 16:44.720
-Sorry.
-Okay, I forgive you.

16:45.200 --> 16:46.920
Okay, see you later.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.200
What are you doing?

16:54.520 --> 16:56.320
Beat it, will you?
I don’t want any chitchat.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.680
How old is he?

17:10.080 --> 17:10.920
Your son.

17:15.640 --> 17:16.600
Seven.

17:17.960 --> 17:18.920
He’s seven.

17:19.720 --> 17:20.600
Where’s he?

17:21.080 --> 17:21.920
With his father?

17:22.440 --> 17:25.120
With his father? Not with him.
He’s never been with his father.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.000
We don’t know anything about his father.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.440
What’s his name?

17:37.520 --> 17:38.520
Axel.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.000
His name’s Axel.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.160
It means "axe."

17:44.840 --> 17:46.080
-Axe.
-Yes.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.040
-And he’s an ace.
-Right...

17:50.240 --> 17:51.280
Just like his mother.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.240
That child is a survivor, you know?

17:57.840 --> 17:59.120
He has survived everything.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.760
He’s like a cork in the middle of the sea,

18:03.240 --> 18:04.320
he doesn’t sink.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.120
That’s the way he is.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.040
When he was three...

18:10.880 --> 18:12.880
I had to take him away
from my mother’s house

18:13.520 --> 18:14.680
because her husband...

18:15.640 --> 18:19.320
gave him anisette when I wasn’t there,
because his sobs bothered him.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.880
So I took him away.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.520
Only the two of us, not needing a family.

18:25.880 --> 18:26.760
Me and him.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.240
And we were fucking great.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.200
But I screwed it up.

18:43.960 --> 18:44.800
One day...

18:47.160 --> 18:49.480
I had to go to get pills to sell.

18:51.040 --> 18:51.960
And...

18:53.960 --> 18:55.120
And I left him alone.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.240
For five minutes.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.520
I’d be away five minutes, right?

19:02.360 --> 19:03.440
And he made a mess

19:03.800 --> 19:06.320
with the fucking Spider-Man.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.680
I piss on Spider-Man!

19:10.160 --> 19:12.160
Because he wanted to be a superhero.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.160
He climbed everywhere.
He climbed very well.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.000
And he got to the terrace
through the window.

19:27.560 --> 19:30.360
There he took a chair, went on the chair

19:30.720 --> 19:32.240
and shouted: "Mummy!"

19:32.600 --> 19:33.840
"Mummy!"

19:35.440 --> 19:37.040
He was three and a half.

19:39.480 --> 19:40.880
Sure, five minutes later

19:41.680 --> 19:46.400
we had a police patrol, the firemen...

19:47.680 --> 19:48.680
Everybody.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.080
They caught me with the pills,

19:54.880 --> 19:56.160
with a record,

19:56.400 --> 19:57.400
without a job.

19:58.680 --> 19:59.680
And to prison I went.

20:00.920 --> 20:04.680
So my child started moving
from one foster family to the next,

20:04.960 --> 20:05.960
from hand to hand.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.800
And I got nothing.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.080
Nothing, huh?

20:10.520 --> 20:13.880
I wasn’t allowed
a single visit, a single call...

20:14.080 --> 20:15.000
Nothing.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.720
Then I was released from prison...

20:17.560 --> 20:18.440
and nothing happened.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.440
They didn’t give him back to me.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.600
-Have you seen him again?
-They won’t let me.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.120
But...

20:29.480 --> 20:30.760
I know where he is.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.120
-Really?
-He’s in the Canary islands.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.520
He’s with a family who owns a hotel.

20:36.920 --> 20:37.760
He’s fine.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.560
Are you going to go and get him?

20:41.960 --> 20:43.400
I’m taking him...

20:44.720 --> 20:45.920
and that’s final.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.160
To the other side of the world.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.280
I’m telling you one thing.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.080
In this robbery

20:52.600 --> 20:55.160
nobody’s going to screw it up,
me or anyone,

20:56.120 --> 20:59.880
if somebody makes a mess of it,
I’ll destroy his life.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.960
Of all the plans all these people have,

21:09.520 --> 21:10.520
yours...

21:11.200 --> 21:12.040
is the best.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.400
And I’m telling you another thing...

21:21.880 --> 21:22.880
Do you like tequila?

22:34.960 --> 22:37.600
It’s 4:03 am.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.360
There’s a lesson early in the morning.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.240
Plastic explosive.

22:45.880 --> 22:46.720
Sorry.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.200
It’d be great if you were
rested for the class.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.640
-We couldn’t sleep.
-Go to bed.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.000
-The three of us together?
-Each of us to their bed.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.240
The pyjamas look
really good on you, Professor.

22:57.560 --> 22:58.440
Now.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.480
Now.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.960
And you... And you with the lights.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.880
That guy really turns me on,
he really turns me on.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.800
-He really turns me on!
-Really? I can’t tell at all.

23:16.040 --> 23:16.920
Can you notice?

23:17.000 --> 23:18.400
-A lot.
-Let him notice.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.640
What a racket, man!

23:39.680 --> 23:40.640
Jesus...

23:43.040 --> 23:44.600
Mónica. Hey... Hey.

23:46.520 --> 23:49.680
-What are you doing here? Are you crazy?
-I wasn’t feeling very well.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.960
I think it’s the medicine, it got me sick.

23:54.800 --> 23:55.920
The medicine.

23:56.720 --> 23:59.200
That will be it, the medicine.
Yes, child. That’ll be it.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.360
Oh my, you’re boiling like a kettle.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.360
She must get the hell out of here.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.400
-I’ll help you.
-Wait, wait.

24:11.400 --> 24:12.600
Could you leave me alone

24:12.760 --> 24:13.600
-for a while?
-Yes.

24:14.080 --> 24:14.960
Please.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.400
What do you think?

24:33.720 --> 24:36.280
She’s not feeling very well.
She looks bad.

24:37.680 --> 24:41.000
If we don’t take that bullet out bullet,
she’s fucked.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.800
Dad, calm down, all right?

24:43.240 --> 24:44.280
She’ll be fine.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.160
Why did you fucking shoot her?

24:51.880 --> 24:55.360
Because Berlin was going to kill her.
I had no other choice.

24:58.360 --> 24:59.440
Son of a bitch.

25:00.480 --> 25:03.200
If he wants to kill somebody,
he should pull the trigger, not you.

25:04.560 --> 25:05.960
We came for a robbery.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.560
Not to kill people. Or to save lives.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.240
We’re fucking wretches, jeez.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.800
-Of all the people...
-Dad, calm down.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.000
Calm down.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.000
Mónica, have you finished yet?

25:23.680 --> 25:24.520
Yes.

25:36.920 --> 25:39.200
-Let’s go.
-Raquel, wait a second.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.360
I want to talk to you.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.320
I want to infiltrate the medical team.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.440
No. Somebody’s getting in, but not you.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.120
Sure. There’s always
someone better than me for everything.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.720
Raquel, I’m a firearms expert.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.240
I can get there and, at a glance,
know how many they have,

26:05.320 --> 26:06.920
what type and if they’re fake or not.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.480
We can know who the robbers are.

26:13.440 --> 26:14.280
You’re right.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.760
You’ll come with me and cover the doctors.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.400
Now I’ll tell you what we’re doing.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.000
I heard a shot before.

26:23.560 --> 26:26.040
The police. They shot a hostage.

26:27.440 --> 26:28.920
-A hostage?
-Yes.

26:30.360 --> 26:31.320
Who?

26:34.240 --> 26:35.080
Who?

26:37.240 --> 26:38.920
Who did the police shoot?

26:41.080 --> 26:42.320
The manager of the factory.

26:43.680 --> 26:44.600
Arturo?

26:46.520 --> 26:47.800
Did the police kill Arturo?

26:48.600 --> 26:50.160
No. They didn’t kill him.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.440
-Is he okay?
-Yes.

26:52.560 --> 26:53.440
Is he alive?

26:54.760 --> 26:56.280
-Is Arturo okay?
-He’s fine. Yes.

26:56.440 --> 26:57.640
-Are you sure?
-Sure.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.400
-Is he okay?
-A surgeon is coming in.

27:00.560 --> 27:01.440
With his team.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.480
He’ll have surgery and will be saved.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.880
-Is he having surgery?
-Yes.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.200
You must tell him I’m alive.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.440
You must tell Arturo.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.280
-Do you hear me?
-Nobody is telling anything.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.880
Because you’ll be fine
and he will as well, okay?

27:18.040 --> 27:20.000
Come on. Let’s have a look at the wound.

27:20.720 --> 27:21.680
Calm down.

27:22.120 --> 27:25.960
He is going to blame himself.
I took the phone because he told me to.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.720
And that now I’m dead because of him.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.760
You must tell him I’m alive, okay?

27:34.440 --> 27:35.720
And his son too.

27:40.440 --> 27:41.560
Are you pregnant?

27:47.520 --> 27:48.440
Very well.

27:49.760 --> 27:51.040
Congratulations.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.720
-Give me a pen, please.
-Okay.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.040
When?

28:03.280 --> 28:04.120
Thanks.

28:05.960 --> 28:06.800
Ángel!

28:15.800 --> 28:17.960
I’ve decided to get our officers
inside the building.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.400
I’ll do it by taking advantage
of the medical intervention.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.440
I celebrate these decisions you make
during ambulance rides.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.400
But my presence here responds
only to the government’s wish

28:27.560 --> 28:29.040
that there isn’t a violent outcome.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.200
Wow!

28:30.880 --> 28:33.400
The CNI officer
has suddenly become a pacifist.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.240
Weren’t you the one
who wanted to get the tanks in there?

28:36.400 --> 28:38.840
I wanted to catch them by surprise.
Finish with this soon.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.520
But now the priority is zero victims.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.440
So I advise to negotiate and wait.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.120
It must suck a lot being here all day

28:48.200 --> 28:51.000
believing you’re the best,
not having to make any decisions, right?

28:52.160 --> 28:54.320
Like being in a hostage crisis talk show.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.320
Inspector, I’m not going to bite

28:56.440 --> 29:00.760
because I understand at a certain age
hormones take over inside.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.480
-I know it because of my mother.
-Where are you going?

29:05.080 --> 29:07.800
As you’ll understand,
I have to inform about all this.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.120
Of course.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.560
So far the kidnappers
have always been ahead of us.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.280
Everything was planned. Except this shot.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.520
It’s the first thing
not according to plan.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.000
And we must take advantage.

29:24.800 --> 29:27.520
The only way to get in
without being detected by their cameras

29:27.680 --> 29:30.120
is to advance
along this tube in the subsoil

29:30.200 --> 29:32.320
that leads straight to the basements.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.040
It’s the ventilation nozzle.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.720
It was added seven months ago
to release the heat from the presses.

29:36.800 --> 29:37.800
It’s a work in progress.

29:38.040 --> 29:42.440
-They probably won’t know it’s there.
-I need two of your men to get in there.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.000
Officer García Lobo,
here, and I’ll go with him.

29:46.160 --> 29:48.120
Fine. Deputy Inspector Rubio

29:48.280 --> 29:51.160
"will go with the two surgeons
and will get in as a nurse."

29:51.480 --> 29:53.960
06:09 pm. Synchronize watches.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.640
"At 06:15 pm
the medical team will come in.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.480
According to the head of internal medicine

29:58.600 --> 30:00.680
the surgery
won’t take more than 30 minutes."

30:01.320 --> 30:04.320
But they can go on exactly until 7:00 pm.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.160
When the doctors go out,

30:06.240 --> 30:08.960
there’ll be a big number
of kidnappers to watch them.

30:09.040 --> 30:12.280
That’s when Suárez and Lobo
will get in through the subsoil.

30:13.640 --> 30:17.000
"They’ll get to the basement’s catch basin
dressed with red overalls and Dalí masks."

30:17.160 --> 30:18.760
They’ll infiltrate among the hostages.

30:19.160 --> 30:22.160
We’ll only be successful
if we do it like clockwork.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.640
Inspector!

30:23.920 --> 30:26.920
-Arturo Román’s wife is here.
-One moment, please.

30:27.680 --> 30:28.960
Suárez, get moving.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.400
Take care of the doctors. And be careful.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.160
Get the operation ready!

30:35.280 --> 30:37.360
What happened? Is my husband okay?

30:38.000 --> 30:39.640
Your husband is conscious and stable.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.200
He was shot by mistake.

30:41.560 --> 30:44.840
-Shot? What do you mean?
-He’s injured, but alive.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.320
Calm down. Calm down.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.720
The kidnappers allow us
to get in a surgical team

30:50.800 --> 30:52.440
and he’ll have surgery immediately.

30:53.680 --> 30:57.040
Sorry, but...
I wasn’t even listening, sorry.

30:57.240 --> 30:58.080
Calm down.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.160
Everything’s gonna be all right.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.480
-Sit down, please.
-Thanks.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.800
-Can you talk to him right now?
-Yes.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.680
Take this.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.120
Almansa, record it!

31:10.120 --> 31:12.160
We must take that bullet out right now.

31:16.680 --> 31:17.760
You do it, dad.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.120
You’re more cold-blooded.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.560
Where’s the surgical kit
the Professor gave us?

31:26.640 --> 31:28.480
-There’s a scalpel there.
-Berlin’s got it.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.040
Jesus.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.480
I don’t think it’s a good idea
to ask him for it.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.920
The surgeons!
Go and steal their tools. Hurry.

31:36.080 --> 31:38.040
-Okay.
-Wait! Wait!

31:38.760 --> 31:40.040
Give him the note, please.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.400
I’ll clean the wound now, okay?

31:53.280 --> 31:55.080
Relax. You’re going to be fine.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.440
-"Hello?"
-Professor, Arturo Román’s wife is here.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.320
Okay.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.120
Arturo.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.400
Arturo!

32:19.960 --> 32:21.440
What’s your wife’s name?

32:23.280 --> 32:24.120
Laura.

32:25.160 --> 32:27.280
What a beautiful name.
Well, you can talk to Laura.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.600
Wives are good for moments like these.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.240
They’re comforting.

32:33.840 --> 32:37.080
Nobody remembers his wife
when you’re in front

32:37.160 --> 32:40.000
of the disco, high as a kite, but...

32:40.680 --> 32:45.640
If you have a problem, an accident
or... you’re simply scared,...

32:46.400 --> 32:47.520
things change.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.840
Are you thinking
about your secretary right now?

32:55.800 --> 32:57.000
Huh? Yes?

32:59.120 --> 32:59.960
No.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.760
But who can think about lovers

33:03.240 --> 33:05.760
with babies who could be aborted...

33:06.280 --> 33:08.520
-or simply nothing?
-Spare me the speech, will you?

33:08.600 --> 33:09.440
Listen to me.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.680
If you say something weird,

33:11.840 --> 33:13.200
I’ll give you the coup de grace

33:13.280 --> 33:15.320
and your wife will hear it live.
Understand?

33:26.280 --> 33:27.200
Inspector!

33:27.720 --> 33:29.160
They’re turning on a phone.

33:30.120 --> 33:31.640
We must tap that phone.

33:31.880 --> 33:33.840
I want to see the selfie and main cameras.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.880
There, there.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.560
"Hello, darling."

33:40.160 --> 33:41.800
Arturo, darling, how are you?

33:42.080 --> 33:43.480
Fine, fine. I’m fine.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.560
-"It was a clean shot."
-There’s no image.

33:45.800 --> 33:48.560
No selfie or main cameras.
They’ve covered them.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.960
"They’re letting some surgeons in."

33:52.960 --> 33:53.880
I know.

33:54.760 --> 33:55.800
Look, I’ve...

33:56.560 --> 33:59.200
I’ve been thinking about you and...

33:59.720 --> 34:01.200
And everything we did wrong.

34:01.360 --> 34:03.240
Don’t think about it, darling. Not now.

34:03.640 --> 34:04.600
"Not now."

34:05.040 --> 34:06.640
Besides, it’s my fault.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.800
I know we’re not fine.
We haven’t been fine for some time.

34:12.080 --> 34:15.480
I’ve neglected you and our children.
I’ve been selfish.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.120
I promise all that’s going to change,
you hear me?

34:19.840 --> 34:21.440
"I promise that’s going to change.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.600
For 10 years you’ve been
saying you want to see

34:24.720 --> 34:26.040
your sister in Australia."

34:27.360 --> 34:29.760
Take the opportunity so the kids
can learn English.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.240
And see kangaroos.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.720
"That’s the first thing
we’ll do when we go out."

34:36.760 --> 34:37.800
I owe you that.

34:39.400 --> 34:40.640
I’ll do it for you.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.520
Because I love you so much.

34:42.760 --> 34:46.040
All these years wasted, chasing...

34:47.560 --> 34:50.600
Thinking all that mattered
was money and the status and...

34:51.120 --> 34:52.960
"But you’re the only important thing.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.480
It’s always been you."

34:57.240 --> 34:58.880
Since the day I met you.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.320
I swear there are times when...

35:03.840 --> 35:05.600
I try to remember that day...

35:06.600 --> 35:09.200
"And I wonder
what the hell you saw in me, Mónica."

35:15.360 --> 35:16.200
Laura.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.440
You just think about getting out of there.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.440
"Just think about that.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.200
I love you."

35:32.040 --> 35:33.160
I love you, honey.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.040
Are you okay?

35:43.080 --> 35:44.000
Calm down.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.040
You’re really experienced, Arturo.

35:49.440 --> 35:52.640
Your secretary... with the belly...

35:53.840 --> 35:57.560
Laurita waiting for you
in the 4x4 with the children.

35:57.840 --> 36:00.880
You, surrounded by money, are a legend.

36:02.920 --> 36:03.760
Berlin!

36:04.200 --> 36:05.560
The doctors are outside!

36:08.280 --> 36:09.960
You must excuse me.

36:15.880 --> 36:19.480
-Do they all know what they have to do?
-They do! Of course they do!

36:19.640 --> 36:20.920
Are you ready?

36:22.280 --> 36:23.200
Well, they’re ready.

36:23.520 --> 36:24.360
Mercedes!

36:26.440 --> 36:27.320
Are you ready?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.480
-Yes, sir.
-I want her out of here.

36:30.760 --> 36:33.040
Rio, take her to an office.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.280
Nairobi.

36:38.160 --> 36:41.000
Put on your masks!

36:42.800 --> 36:45.160
And with me! Rock and roll!

36:59.400 --> 37:00.240
Come in.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.840
Leave everything on the floor.

37:13.280 --> 37:14.120
Close the door.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.160
Move forward.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.080
Your hands on your head and legs apart.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.320
We’re frisking you.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.400
Get him out of here, please.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.440
"Listen to me."

38:08.400 --> 38:10.520
One of the nurses is an undercover cop.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.680
-Which one?
-"The one with glasses.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.520
You know what you have to do."

38:14.600 --> 38:16.640
-Perfectly. Let’s get to it.
-Berlin!

38:17.800 --> 38:20.280
It has to be a fucking precision work.

38:20.760 --> 38:21.760
I know.

38:24.240 --> 38:25.080
People!

38:25.480 --> 38:27.200
The one with glasses is the cop.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.000
They’ll come in.

38:31.320 --> 38:34.320
Maybe during an assault,
during an emergency...

38:34.400 --> 38:36.800
It could be the Red Cross guy
or the pizza guy,

38:36.960 --> 38:41.480
but it’s obvious they’ll try
to infiltrate someone.

38:42.640 --> 38:46.760
And that will be our chance
to try and give them a Trojan horse.

38:47.240 --> 38:48.440
Do you know what that is?

38:48.600 --> 38:51.120
-I don’t know, but it rhymes easily.
-No!

38:52.360 --> 38:54.400
-The Trojan horse...
-Was pretty hoarse!

38:54.960 --> 38:57.240
Shut up and focus, Jesus!

38:57.520 --> 38:58.360
Sorry.

39:00.760 --> 39:01.600
I’m sorry.

39:04.280 --> 39:06.440
The Greeks were at war with the Trojans.

39:08.200 --> 39:11.280
One day the Trojans found
in front of their city

39:11.440 --> 39:13.960
a wooden horse, a huge wooden horse!

39:15.360 --> 39:16.440
And, out of vanity,

39:16.520 --> 39:19.680
they thought it was a surrender present
by the Greeks.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.240
So they opened the gates...

39:21.920 --> 39:23.200
and they put it inside.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.320
But they didn’t know that horse was hollow

39:27.400 --> 39:29.560
and full of Greek warriors.

39:32.640 --> 39:34.680
That night the Trojans lost the war.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.280
And that’s exactly
what we are going to do.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.560
When they try to get in

39:50.000 --> 39:52.120
thinking they’re winning the battle...

40:09.800 --> 40:12.360
Leave all your metallic objects
on that tray.

40:13.480 --> 40:14.560
Glasses.

40:15.000 --> 40:15.840
Watches.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.520
If you have weapons,

40:17.920 --> 40:20.400
microphones... I also advise you
to let them there.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.960
We’re going to track
any type of radiofrequency.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.440
Take off your shoes too. Please.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.280
And now lie down.

40:31.960 --> 40:32.800
On the ground.

40:37.080 --> 40:37.960
Very well.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.200
Like cockroaches.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.280
Stand up.

41:13.480 --> 41:14.680
Put on your shoes.

41:20.360 --> 41:21.360
Take only the glasses.

41:21.960 --> 41:22.960
You’re going to need them.

41:24.480 --> 41:28.800
"Now yes... Welcome.
Take your things and come with me.

41:29.000 --> 41:29.960
Thanks."
