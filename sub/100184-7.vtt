‐Okay.
‐Oh, I think

49:23.878 --> 49:25.254
I'm listening, Gigi.

49:25.337 --> 49:27.006
What we're saying is, we're...
hold on... we're trying

49:27.089 --> 49:28.674
to figure this out
with <i>you.</i>

49:28.757 --> 49:30.342
Well, what I'm saying, Gigi,

49:30.426 --> 49:32.094
is I don't think that
I'm really needed here.

49:32.178 --> 49:36.056
And I think you guys look really
good together.

49:36.140 --> 49:38.100
I mean, it's just like...

49:38.184 --> 49:41.103
There's nothing missing,
it's just so...

49:41.187 --> 49:42.521
I don't think
you need me.

49:42.605 --> 49:44.023
‐So, I'm gonna go.
‐Alice...

49:44.106 --> 49:46.525
And you and I can just
talk on the phone,

49:46.609 --> 49:49.195
and I will figure out how
to get my stuff out of...

49:49.278 --> 49:51.614
[waitress] I have one
Cobb salad and a tortilla soup,

49:51.697 --> 49:53.407
two spoons.

49:53.782 --> 49:54.783
Thank you.

49:54.867 --> 49:58.204
One soup, two spoons, guys?

49:58.287 --> 49:59.121
[chuckles]
Enjoy your lunch.

50:03.626 --> 50:04.668
[Nat gasps]

50:04.752 --> 50:06.128
[Gigi]
Alice.

50:08.631 --> 50:09.173
[waitress]
Enjoy.

50:10.466 --> 50:13.219
[sighs]

50:18.849 --> 50:20.726
All right, um...

50:20.809 --> 50:23.687
have you ever done something
that you were, like...

50:23.771 --> 50:25.856
pretty sure you'll regret?

50:25.940 --> 50:29.068
I mean, it took me a while to
settle into my bangs, but...

50:29.151 --> 50:31.403
‐I don't regret them.
‐Oh. All right.

50:31.487 --> 50:33.322
[chuckles]

50:34.490 --> 50:36.534
I kissed Finley.

50:36.617 --> 50:39.036
‐Wait, what?
‐We were in the hospital.

50:39.119 --> 50:41.413
She brought me all these snacks.

50:41.497 --> 50:43.791
So you kiss her because
she brought you snacks?

50:43.874 --> 50:44.792
No. Like...

50:44.875 --> 50:48.003
she was with me all day.

50:48.087 --> 50:50.381
She was trying
to leave, and...

50:50.464 --> 50:52.341
‐I didn't want her to go.
‐So you kissed her?

50:52.424 --> 50:54.093
‐You kissed Finley?
‐Yeah.

50:54.176 --> 50:55.594
‐With, like, tongue?
‐Ew. Dude.

50:55.678 --> 50:56.303
No, all right?

50:56.387 --> 50:58.264
Stop. Don't be
gross, okay?

51:00.099 --> 51:03.561
[sighs] Oh, God, I feel
like such a piece of shit.

51:03.644 --> 51:05.479
No, you're not.

51:05.896 --> 51:07.189
You're not.

51:08.941 --> 51:12.111
‐Are you gonna tell Dani?
‐No.

51:12.194 --> 51:14.029
I mean, I can't.
It would just...

51:14.113 --> 51:15.281
oh, my God, it would crush her.

51:15.364 --> 51:16.907
And it doesn't even matter.
There's no point,

51:16.991 --> 51:18.993
because it's never
gonna happen again.

51:19.076 --> 51:20.202
So, no, I can't.

51:22.037 --> 51:23.289
I can't.

51:23.372 --> 51:25.791
I shouldn't. Right?

51:26.750 --> 51:28.043
Right?

51:28.127 --> 51:30.337
Right?

51:34.216 --> 51:36.093
[sighs]
Fuck.
