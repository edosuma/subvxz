WEBVTT

00:09.426 --> 00:14.806
I haven't exactly been honest
with you, Peter...

00:14.931 --> 00:20.186
I'm no longer able to participate
in your documentary.

00:20.270 --> 00:24.983
I'm sorry, but your ending is the same
as your beginning.

00:25.066 --> 00:30.822
I did it. It's me.

00:30.905 --> 00:35.785
I am the Turd Burglar.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.787
[Peter] Kevin texted us,
about dropping out of the doc,

01:18.870 --> 01:22.165
the morning after DeMarcus
and Lou confronted him in this video.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.710
But at the time
we received Kevin's texts,

01:26.211 --> 01:28.338
we didn't even know this video existed.

01:29.005 --> 01:31.800
Gonzo had just told us
about a team-wide cover up

01:31.883 --> 01:33.343
protecting DeMarcus and Lou.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.385
DO YOU HAVE DEMENTIA?

01:34.469 --> 01:38.389
[Peter] Then Kevin stop talking to us,
before we had a chance to tell him.

01:39.140 --> 01:41.267
He blocked our numbers and social media,

01:41.643 --> 01:43.311
and we had no idea why.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.065
All we knew is that
something must have happened.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.151
Something must have stopped Kevin
from talking.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.569
Something...

01:52.153 --> 01:53.321
or someone.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.202
[knocking on door]

02:02.956 --> 02:04.332
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.209
-[Peter] Is Kevin here?
-No.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.586
-[Peter] Really? You sure?
-Yeah.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.505
[Sam] We just need to hand him
a piece of paper.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.924
We just need to ask him a few questions,
it won't take long.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.552
-He's not here.
-He's... Okay.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.096
[Peter] Listen, he's not answering
any of our texts and calls,

02:18.179 --> 02:20.890
and this is something really important
that he's gonna want to see.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.851
-Could you give me a second?
-Sure.

02:25.436 --> 02:26.688
What is going on?

02:26.896 --> 02:28.898
[beeping]

02:34.988 --> 02:37.490
-Yep, he is not here.
-Really?

02:37.574 --> 02:40.285
[Peter] Can you give to him and tell him
to call us when he gets back?

02:40.368 --> 02:42.620
He'll want to see this email
from the basketball team.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.206
-Are you...? Myles.
-[slams door]

02:46.166 --> 02:47.876
[laughs] Myles!

02:48.042 --> 02:49.419
-Really?
-[Peter] That was so rude.

02:49.544 --> 02:50.378
Wow.

02:50.962 --> 02:51.880
That's just mean.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.507
Alright, we're leaving it in your mailbox!

02:54.591 --> 02:56.134
That was just rude.

02:56.759 --> 03:00.346
Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice message system.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.306
Let's just go.

03:01.681 --> 03:05.101
Nine-six-zero-four is not available.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.811
He blocked us on everything.

03:06.895 --> 03:10.481
He won't respond to our texts,
our phone calls, our emails.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.359
He's even pretending not to be home.
We went to his house.

03:13.484 --> 03:14.986
But he's on house arrest.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.322
I just don't understand why.

03:17.405 --> 03:19.449
I mean, we're so close to proving
that he's innocent.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.910
It doesn't make any sense
why he'd drop out now.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.161
Okay, so what do we do?

03:23.244 --> 03:25.163
I mean, we could show up
to his house again,

03:25.246 --> 03:26.706
but he's probably won't even answer.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.499
It can't be that hard
to get a hold of Kevin.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.418
He only hangs out one of two places.

03:30.501 --> 03:33.213
I'm either at home with my sister
and my grandmother,

03:33.296 --> 03:37.967
or here at the 24 Stop.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.846
Oh, the 24 Stop.
We could try to meet him there.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.265
-That's actually not a bad idea.
-I know.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.477
[Sam] You just have to get it by surprise.

03:49.062 --> 03:49.896
Fail.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.983
-I mean, it's like cold--
-Hey.

03:54.651 --> 03:55.902
No loitering.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.820
-Oh.
-Yeah, no, sorry.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.698
We're waiting for our friend.
He's gonna be here real soon.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.992
Well, you gotta buy something
or wait somewhere else.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.286
We're waiting for our friend Kevin.
You probably know him.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.413
The kid with the Newsies hat
and the pocket watch.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.456
He lives down the block.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.959
I know who you're talking about.
He's not coming back here.

04:11.542 --> 04:12.710
Why do you say that?

04:12.877 --> 04:14.337
Because I banned him.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.214
-What?
-Why did you ban him?

04:17.048 --> 04:20.093
Guys, look, buy something, leave,
or I am calling the cops.

04:20.802 --> 04:21.636
Calling the...?

04:24.430 --> 04:25.807
Let's go, let's buy something.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.060
Would you mind telling us
why Kevin was banned?

04:29.143 --> 04:30.311
It's a chip, not a swipe.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.896
Maybe what day he was banned?

04:32.063 --> 04:34.565
-Or, like, anything you can tell us.
-You can't stand there.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.068
You're gonna have to move
out of the aisle. I have customers.

04:37.151 --> 04:39.112
Sir, I'm afraid that my friend
might be in trouble,

04:39.195 --> 04:41.823
so I'm just trying to find out, like,
what was going on.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.199
Do you want a bag?

04:43.825 --> 04:45.535
Nah. You know what? I'll wear it out.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.287
Come on, we bought something
like you asked.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.289
Could you please just tell us
something, anything?

04:49.372 --> 04:51.916
Look, he came in here, okay,
I had to kick him out.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.960
He made a mess of my store. Okay?

04:54.043 --> 04:58.298
Wait, Kevin McClain, the one
with the pocket watch and the hat?

04:58.589 --> 04:59.799
Look, I have footage. Alright?

04:59.882 --> 05:01.968
He's lucky I haven't sent that footage
to the cops.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.721
-[Peter] Could you show us the footage?
-No.

05:06.514 --> 05:07.974
[sighs]

05:11.644 --> 05:13.229
You're gonna buy seven more hats?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.982
And a snow globe,
if you show us the security footage.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.654
[employee] So the kid, I guess,
dropped his ice cream outside.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.782
He goes crazy, comes in here
like some kind of zombie.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.411
Opens up the freezer,
just starts taking ice cream out

05:28.494 --> 05:30.121
without paying for it. Sits on the floor--

05:30.204 --> 05:31.414
Look, he's eating it.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.166
Never paid a dime for it.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.126
So I go over and I tell him,

05:35.209 --> 05:36.627
[employee] "Hey, you can't do that."

05:37.420 --> 05:38.921
He doesn't say anything to me.

05:39.756 --> 05:40.923
I kick him out.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.675
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

05:43.134 --> 05:44.344
Banned him for life.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.346
[Peter] Could you show us
the outside footage?

05:46.429 --> 05:47.263
Yeah.

05:48.264 --> 05:52.310
[Peter] As we watch DeMarcus pull up
in Lou's car and get in Kevin's face,

05:52.643 --> 05:54.812
everything began to take shape.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.107
It made sense that Kevin dropped out
of the documentary.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.943
He was scared. Who wouldn't be?

06:01.736 --> 06:04.697
We had spent so long
organizing puzzle pieces.

06:05.239 --> 06:08.076
Now, they were quickly falling into place.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.288
-[birds chirping]
-[Peter sniffs]

06:12.872 --> 06:14.207
Alright, take a seat.

06:14.290 --> 06:18.544
-Okay. [sighs]
-Yeah, whenever you're ready.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.421
-I like that hat.
-[Sam] Thank you.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.595
[Chloe] Oh, shit.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.681
And this is from the night
before Kevin texted us.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.892
So this happens, and the next day

06:32.975 --> 06:34.977
Kevin re-confesses
to being the Turd Burglar.

06:35.061 --> 06:35.895
Yes.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.523
I mean, Lou and DeMarcus
are clearly threatening him.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.816
It's right there in the video.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.859
What other reason would they need
to threaten him?

06:41.943 --> 06:45.071
Do Kevin and DeMarcus have any reason to
be speaking other than this documentary?

06:45.154 --> 06:46.864
-No.
-Is this a weird meeting?

06:46.948 --> 06:48.366
-It's super weird.
-They don't talk.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.326
So you don't think
this was a planned meeting?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.286
You think he was definitely confronted?

06:52.370 --> 06:53.413
[Chloe] See, look, there.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.375
Kevin seems genuinely surprised
to see them.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.334
[Peter] Yeah.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.670
And how did they know
to find him at the 24 Stop?

07:00.753 --> 07:04.132
Well, actually post-expulsion,
Kevin's been very active on social media.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.552
Like, Instagram, Twitter, and stuff,
and he's always sure to tag his location.

07:07.635 --> 07:11.889
[Kevin] Do you care to defend
the $3 surcharge on this ATM?

07:11.973 --> 07:12.890
No.

07:14.851 --> 07:15.810
Didn't think so.

07:15.893 --> 07:18.604
[Sam] So they probably stalked him online
and knew where to find him.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.440
They actually were
really smart about this,

07:20.523 --> 07:22.024
'cause if you're gonna
confront someone,

07:22.108 --> 07:25.153
you don't do it in front of their grandma,
at their house,

07:25.236 --> 07:27.864
in front of their sister,
you do it somewhere else.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.824
-You find neutral ground, right?
-Exactly.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.034
I think we confront Lou and DeMarcus
about this video.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.496
No, let's go to the cops first.

07:35.580 --> 07:36.581
No, no, no.

07:36.664 --> 07:39.250
There are two sides to this video
and I want to hear both sides.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.711
No, I'm with Chloe on this one, man.
Let's go to the cops.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.379
We will, just not yet.

07:44.046 --> 07:46.591
We need to hear
what they have to say about it.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.925
I'm sending them this footage.

07:49.051 --> 07:51.596
"Would you care to explain
what's going on in this video?"

07:51.679 --> 07:52.513
Yeah, okay.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.931
[text sent beep]

07:58.478 --> 08:00.605
[Lou] You don't know
what happened in that conversation.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.232
[Peter] Okay, so what exactly was said?

08:04.192 --> 08:05.276
Look, bro.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.905
It's just so clear that Kevin did it,
alright?

08:09.530 --> 08:13.159
It's clear. So all we said was
stop talking shit about us.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.535
[Lou] ''We know you did it.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.829
Ain't no need to be trying
to bring us down with you.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.123
DeMarcus is one of the best players
in the country.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.834
If it gets out that he did
some turd shit...''

08:23.628 --> 08:26.297
Okay, but why would you
feel the need to hide something

08:26.380 --> 08:27.590
if you have nothing to hide?

08:27.673 --> 08:29.717
We not trying to hide!
We're just trying to figure out

08:29.800 --> 08:31.844
why does he want to start rumors
about somebody else?

08:31.928 --> 08:34.347
DeMarcus didn't do this, man.
He didn't do it.

08:34.430 --> 08:36.474
There's no way he could have done it.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.352
So, the email from the captain
of the basketball team,

08:39.936 --> 08:41.479
Gonzo's black eye,

08:41.687 --> 08:43.606
the 24 Stop footage, that's all...

08:44.190 --> 08:47.068
-just a coincidence?
-Yes, it is all just a coincidence.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.696
Man, that email has nothing to do
with the whole Turd Burglar thing.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.574
Oh my God!

08:53.699 --> 08:57.286
The email from the captain,
this wasn't part of some crazy cover-up.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.956
This is about DeMarcus's ankle, man.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.501
DeMarcus had just tweaked his ankle,

09:03.584 --> 09:06.546
so we went to see a physical therapist
before the pep rally.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.965
We didn't need anybody
finding out about that.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.635
If a rumor like that gets out about D,

09:13.010 --> 09:15.846
him being one of the top athletes, man,
that's just bad news.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.307
Real bad news.

09:18.849 --> 09:22.061
So, we skipped the pep rally rehearsal
to go handle some shit.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.439
[Peter] So, you're saying that Gonzo
and the rest of the team

09:25.523 --> 09:27.608
had no idea about the physical therapy.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.986
[Lou]
No, I'm telling you they had no idea.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.238
We didn't tell nobody but Tyler.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.322
No one else.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.409
And that's why he sent the email, man.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.828
We don't want anybody finding out
about that shit.

09:39.120 --> 09:39.954
Look.

09:43.958 --> 09:44.959
Physical therapy.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.004
Look at the date and look at the time.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.716
So, then, what about Gonzo's black eye?

09:52.049 --> 09:53.551
[Gonzo] Chloe was telling the truth.

09:53.634 --> 09:57.221
She saw the Turd Burglar card
in DeMarcus' wallet and I saw it too.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.390
[Demarcus] Yeah, I punched him in his eye.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.350
I don't give a shit.
I'll tell anybody that.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.769
[Lou] He's lying, man.
I don't like liars, bro.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.271
D is a cool dude.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.399
He don't deserve to have a rumors
like that going around right now, man.

10:08.482 --> 10:09.650
We almost done.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.777
[Peter] So, then, why were you late
to the pep rally?

10:11.861 --> 10:14.614
We was always gonna miss the rehearsal
for physical therapy,

10:14.989 --> 10:18.034
but we would have been on time
for the pep rally

10:18.117 --> 10:21.037
if we didn't get into a fender bender
with Jenna Hawthorne.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.665
We was pulling up to the gym,
she ran into my car with hers.

10:25.041 --> 10:28.419
She broke her side view mirror,
scraped my shit all up.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.004
You think I'm lying?

10:32.048 --> 10:33.132
There you go.

10:34.258 --> 10:37.803
Invoice from Jenna Hawthorne, $750.

10:37.928 --> 10:38.804
Look, Peter...

10:40.348 --> 10:42.391
You looking at all of this wrong, man.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.227
Wrong. It's not me.

10:45.728 --> 10:46.896
It's not DeMarcus.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.314
It's your boy.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.192
Alright? The dude did it.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.070
Enough already.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.572
He confessed.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.993
[Peter] Something about
my conversation with Lou

11:01.452 --> 11:03.954
made me feel
like he was telling the truth.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.292
Somehow, his defense felt plausible.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.505
Maybe I was seeing it all wrong.

11:12.963 --> 11:17.093
Perhaps the email from the team's captain
wasn't meant to cover upÂ a crime.

11:18.302 --> 11:22.056
Maybe it was just meant to keep the health
of their star player under wraps.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.102
Perhaps the confrontations
with Gonzo and Kevin

11:26.185 --> 11:28.312
weren't simply about intimidation.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.022
But instead,

11:30.231 --> 11:32.942
about keeping them
from spreading untrue rumors

11:33.109 --> 11:34.485
that could hurt DeMarcus.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.530
[Chloe] Okay, see, I'm not buying
any of this shit.

11:38.114 --> 11:41.409
I mean, it's new evidence
that we need to process.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.328
This physical therapy form
could easily be faked,

11:44.412 --> 11:45.788
and the Venmo receipt?

11:46.163 --> 11:47.289
It's nothing.

11:47.665 --> 11:51.711
I mean, if anything it's a distraction
because this is all we actually need.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.588
I mean, look. It's recorded.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.550
At 7:52 on January 22nd,

11:57.633 --> 12:01.095
we can clearly see that DeMarcus
and Lou are trying to shut Kevin up.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.056
We need to go to the cops with this.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.016
You know what, Pete,
I think I might be with her.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.520
I mean, [huffs] we've talked to Lou,
Kevin won't talk to us.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.982
We've exhausted all of our resources.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.943
[Cloe] I understand that you want to use
all evidence,

12:16.026 --> 12:19.113
but, like, this is legit,
we don't know if this is.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.573
Okay, but then we go to the police?

12:20.656 --> 12:23.284
The police who convicted Kevin
in the first place?

12:23.367 --> 12:25.411
And how is that gonna turn out for us?

12:25.494 --> 12:26.704
But if we don't go to the cops,

12:26.787 --> 12:29.623
then we're sitting on evidence
that could exonerate him?

12:29.749 --> 12:32.042
Like, what's worse in that circumstance?

12:32.376 --> 12:33.544
You know what, I'm...

12:33.627 --> 12:36.714
I'm gonna message the Turd Burglar
just one more time.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.549
[Sam] What? Why, man?
What are you gonna say?

12:38.632 --> 12:41.302
I don't want to go to the police just yet.
We're not there yet.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.013
Does the Turd Burglar usually
respond quickly?

12:44.555 --> 12:45.890
It's sporadic.

12:47.433 --> 12:48.392
Okay, Peter,

12:48.517 --> 12:51.061
when was the last time
the Turd Burglar contacted you?

12:51.145 --> 12:52.855
The other day, like, at...

12:55.149 --> 12:56.025
Oh, shit.

12:59.528 --> 13:00.863
Oh, shit!

13:03.866 --> 13:05.326
[Peter] It'll be a short interview,

13:05.409 --> 13:07.203
and trust me
you guys are gonna be very happy.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.580
There's something really important
I need to show you guys.

13:11.248 --> 13:14.502
It'll only take a second.
I promise you it'll only take a second.

13:14.668 --> 13:19.006
So, the night you guys went
to visit Kevin at the 24 Stop...

13:20.925 --> 13:22.259
it was the same night...

13:23.010 --> 13:26.639
that these DMs... were sent to me
from the Turd Burglar.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.766
And we watched the footage
a few times.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.936
And none of you guys
were ever on your phones.

13:34.855 --> 13:35.689
So?

13:35.773 --> 13:39.568
The DMs were sent to me
at the same exact time

13:39.652 --> 13:42.196
-that this footage took place.
-[Lou] Right.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.573
Which means that none of you guys
could be the Turd Burglar.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.659
Right. Oh my God. Thank you, bro.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.452
I told you. What'd I tell you, bro?

13:48.536 --> 13:51.580
You think my man got time to be dealing
with all of y'all's shit crimes?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.165
But actually, here's the thing,

13:53.249 --> 13:56.252
this also proves
that Kevin couldn't be the Turd Burglar,

13:56.335 --> 13:58.546
'cause he also is not on his phone.

13:59.964 --> 14:03.551
[Peter] A video that once looked
so damning for Lou and DeMarcus

14:03.884 --> 14:05.719
ended up exonerating them.

14:06.220 --> 14:09.348
It proved that the Turd Burglar
had to be someone else,

14:09.932 --> 14:14.144
and it led to information that steered us
in an entirely new direction.

14:14.228 --> 14:16.272
-[Lou] Wait, so Kevin didn't do it.
-That's correct.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.439
So, who you think did it?

14:17.940 --> 14:20.109
Well, that's why I wanted
to sit down with you again,

14:20.192 --> 14:22.361
'cause there's something you said
in our last interview.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.947
We would have been on time
for the pep rally

14:25.030 --> 14:27.408
if we didn't get into a fender bender
with Jenna.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.535
You guys said that you were
late to the pep rally

14:29.618 --> 14:31.871
-'cause you got into an accident.
-Yeah, with Jenna.

14:31.954 --> 14:36.000
[Peter] Could you tell me a little bit
about that accident with Jenna Hawthorne?

14:37.418 --> 14:40.713
[Lou] What I remember was...
Jenna was running out of the gym,

14:40.880 --> 14:42.214
like, real fast.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.341
And then I see her get in her car.

14:44.925 --> 14:48.178
We were coming back from D's
physical therapy, trying to park.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.725
And Jenna, her dumb ass, just pulls out
without even looking.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.143
[cars crash]

14:54.226 --> 14:56.061
[Lou] She scared the shit out of me.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.107
She came out at this weird angle

15:00.190 --> 15:02.651
to where her side mirror
on the passenger side...

15:03.360 --> 15:04.612
hit my headlight.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.031
Fucked up my bumper.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.868
And the paint on my car is hard to get.
That's why I was pissed.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.411
Because my shit is vintage, you know.

15:12.494 --> 15:15.539
But she gave me the money on the spot,
I ain't trippin'.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.249
Yeah, you gotta respect her for that.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.127
If you rich and you're gonna be
a terrible driver, that's the way to be.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.211
Treat it responsible.

15:21.295 --> 15:25.007
Outside of crashing into shit,
she pay for it, know what I mean?

15:25.090 --> 15:26.759
Yeah. Why you asking about Jenna?

15:26.842 --> 15:28.469
Well... [sighs]

15:29.053 --> 15:31.472
Jenna claims
that she was at her internship...

15:31.764 --> 15:33.432
at the time of the Shit Launcher.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.601
As soon as that I could get,
like, an internship

15:35.684 --> 15:39.647
that was three days a week for credit,
I hopped on that opportunity.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.983
[Peter] Jenna claims that she goes
to an internship a few times a week...

15:43.067 --> 15:45.527
Yes, every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.197
...but this accident completely shatters
her alibi.

15:48.864 --> 15:52.076
And why would she lie to me
about where she was...

15:52.409 --> 15:54.078
unless she had something to hide?

15:54.244 --> 15:58.123
[Peter] Jenna's internship was her alibi
for all three crimes.

15:58.832 --> 16:01.335
But as we now know,
on the day of the pep rally,

16:01.418 --> 16:04.964
she was parked in the lot
right outside the basketball gym.

16:05.381 --> 16:08.092
That would have given her
the ability to load the launchers

16:08.175 --> 16:09.468
and quickly get away.

16:10.260 --> 16:14.640
We also know that Jenna's parents
own a food processing company

16:14.723 --> 16:19.103
that manufactures preservatives,
including Maltitol

16:19.353 --> 16:20.688
Industrial quantities of it.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.691
The ingredient
that caused the Brownout.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.777
But as bad as this all looks for Jenna,

16:27.069 --> 16:30.239
it pales in comparison
to what Sam discovered

16:30.322 --> 16:32.366
in one of Lou's insurance photos.

16:32.783 --> 16:35.452
Jenna initially told us
that she WAS at her internship

16:35.536 --> 16:36.829
on the day of the Shit Launcher.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.288
-That was her alibi.
-Right.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.125
But we discovered that she was actually
at the school...

16:41.458 --> 16:43.669
and in an accident
with Lou and DeMarcus,

16:43.877 --> 16:47.131
-which means that she was actually--
-She was at the pep rally.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.215
Exactly,

16:48.799 --> 16:50.259
-But that's not all. Sam?
-No.

16:50.592 --> 16:54.722
Look what we found in the front seat
passenger side of her car.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.100
Oh, shit, are those the T-shirts?

16:58.517 --> 17:00.310
[Peter] Yeah, from the pep rally.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.522
And now here's my question.
Can you get those T-shirts anywhere?

17:03.605 --> 17:05.149
Can you get them
from the school store?

17:05.232 --> 17:07.818
No, they're made specifically
for the pep rally.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.487
So, the only place those T-shirts
could have come from--

17:10.571 --> 17:11.572
The T-shirt cannon.

17:11.655 --> 17:14.742
So, she has a strong motive,
she hates the kids at St. Bernardine,

17:14.825 --> 17:16.827
for the ridicule
over the Kendall Jenner photo,

17:16.910 --> 17:18.495
so she would want to shit
all over them.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.498
She has access to the Maltitol.
She lied to us about her alibi,

17:21.582 --> 17:24.626
and we have the smoking gun T-shirt
evidence in the front seat of her car.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.295
Shit!

17:27.212 --> 17:29.173
I think I'm gonna do it, man.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.801
-Can I do it?
-Yeah. Do your string thing, man.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.853
Jenna's the Turd Burglar.

17:45.606 --> 17:49.526
NICRO HEADQUARTERS
DURING INTERNSHIP HOURS

17:50.402 --> 17:52.404
-[Sam] You want to carry that?
-I[Peter] I'm alright.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.573
[Sam] Yeah, here.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.283
Alright, close it for me?

17:57.076 --> 17:57.993
Come on.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.246
This is it.

18:01.747 --> 18:02.998
Let's wait at her car.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.834
-This is the one, yeah.
-Turn on the camera.

18:06.668 --> 18:07.920
What are you guys doing?

18:09.421 --> 18:11.423
Oh. Hi, Jenna, I didn't even...

18:11.507 --> 18:13.634
Sorry, I didn't even realize
that you were in your car.

18:13.717 --> 18:14.927
Yeah, well, I am.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.806
Did you go to your internship
on November 14th?

18:20.182 --> 18:21.767
I don't know. Probably, yeah.

18:23.143 --> 18:26.105
So, you weren't in a collision
with Lou and DeMarcus?

18:27.397 --> 18:28.816
Yeah, I was in an accident.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.571
So you were at the school
at the time that you told us

18:34.655 --> 18:36.281
that you were at your internship?

18:38.033 --> 18:40.035
Right after you did the Shit Launcher.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.287
Wow. Yeah, you're crazy.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.164
Are we?

18:45.249 --> 18:46.917
Yeah, I skipped my internship.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.544
Then...

18:50.462 --> 18:53.465
why were the T-shirts that were
supposed to be in the T-shirt launchers

18:53.549 --> 18:55.050
in the front seat of your car?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.680
[Peter] You have no alibi.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.975
You were at the school.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.310
You did the Shit Launchers.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.105
-You're the Turd Burglar.
-No, I'm not.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.900
-Then why were the T-shirts in your car?
-Peter, I swear to God,

19:11.984 --> 19:13.360
I'm not the Turd Burglar.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.612
[Peter] Could you answer the questions?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.618
Why were the T-shirts
in the front seat of your car?

19:24.663 --> 19:28.458
[coughs] Because I was there and I helped,
but I didn't do it.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.502
Like, I'm not the Turd Burglar.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.964
I just did the gym and that's it.
Literally none of the other stuff.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.174
She, like...

19:35.632 --> 19:37.342
blackmailed me,
she, like, made me do it.

19:38.719 --> 19:39.678
Who made you do it?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.265
Someone-- [huffs]

19:44.600 --> 19:46.143
Someone named Brooke Wheeler.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.395
Brooke Wheeler?

19:50.397 --> 19:51.440
Shit.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.567
I'm just, like-- Sorry, guys.

19:53.650 --> 19:56.236
I'm just, like, way too stoned
to do this right now.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.988
-Okay?
-Can...

19:58.530 --> 20:01.366
I'll talk to you later. [sniffs]

20:01.533 --> 20:04.703
[Peter] Jenna agreed to sit down with us
for a formal interview,

20:04.786 --> 20:07.289
after giving herself time
to get less high.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.417
I'd been so upset
about my break-up last year.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.129
And then I, like,
opened Instagram one day

20:14.213 --> 20:18.258
and this girl had liked, like, ten,
maybe 15 pictures of mine in a row.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.970
There's only one reason
why people do shit like that.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.473
They want your attention.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.683
And she got mine.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.811
[Jena] So, I click on her profile,

20:29.895 --> 20:32.814
and she's, like, not the type of girl
that normally likes my stuff.

20:32.898 --> 20:37.110
Like, she's not
super into fashion and travel.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.071
She's just, like, a normal girl.

20:39.529 --> 20:42.366
Except she's, like, cute.
Like, she's, like, really cute.

20:42.616 --> 20:45.035
So I like a couple of her photos back,

20:45.118 --> 20:47.829
and it wasn't long before she DM'd me.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.166
[Jena] And, like, she didn't know
about my family

20:51.708 --> 20:52.876
and our money,

20:53.335 --> 20:55.462
so it really felt like a fresh start.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.131
But then things started moving
really fast,

20:58.215 --> 21:02.427
and we started texting every day,
like on and off the Gram.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.265
And it wasn't long before she told me
that she loved me.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.267
And I thought she did.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.228
And I thought that I loved her back.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.982
We talked about everything, like...

21:15.440 --> 21:17.901
like, every night for, like, hours.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.530
You know, like, our secrets
and insecurities.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.908
Like, I'd never been so open with anyone
in my entire life.

21:25.450 --> 21:29.579
I even told her about, like,
what happened at school with...

21:30.956 --> 21:32.541
you know,
everyone turning against me.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.669
[Jena] Including my girlfriend,

21:36.044 --> 21:38.213
who dumped me because of it.

21:39.089 --> 21:41.633
And Brooke was going through
a breakup at the time too.

21:43.010 --> 21:46.722
[Peter]
A conversation from September 14th, 2017.

21:47.764 --> 21:50.017
[Jena]
One day everyone wants to be your friend.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.853
The next, everyone wants to see you cry.

21:53.603 --> 21:57.190
[Brooke] Aw, babe, I'm sorry.
It's because everyone's so jealous of you.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.985
[Jena] You know what's sick, though?

22:00.360 --> 22:01.903
After everything happened,

22:02.029 --> 22:03.572
I realized that's all I had.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.199
[Brooke] What do you mean?

22:06.825 --> 22:08.702
[Jena] When everyone decided to hate me,

22:08.994 --> 22:11.496
all I could do was either
curl up in a ball and cry,

22:11.788 --> 22:14.791
or post things to make everyone
more jealous of me.

22:15.584 --> 22:19.421
I realized... I liked
when people were jealous of me.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.548
It made me feel less alone.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.468
I've never told anyone that.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.846
[Brooke] I don't see
how anyone could hate you, Jenna.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.640
I think I'm falling in love with you.

22:31.933 --> 22:34.686
She knew exactly
what to say to cheer me up.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.689
[Jena] I don't know
how I'm going to tell my family

22:37.773 --> 22:40.192
I'm in love with someone
who lives an hour away.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.152
[Brooke] Me neither.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.528
What a pickle.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.655
She had this cute nickname for me.

22:47.032 --> 22:47.908
"Pickle."

22:48.742 --> 22:50.827
I was her little Pickle.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.245
Hey, Pickle.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.999
[sighs] I'm going to bed
and I wanted to say goodnight.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.920
And so, yeah, I sent her some pictures.

23:00.337 --> 23:03.048
Pictures, I wouldn't want anyone seeing.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.928
But then things got dark.
She starts telling me that, like,

23:08.428 --> 23:10.138
I should get back at my classmates.

23:10.222 --> 23:14.267
That, like, I should do something bold
if I hate everyone

23:14.351 --> 23:15.685
at my stupid school so much.

23:16.269 --> 23:19.189
[Brooke] If you don't, I'm going to show
everyone all of your pictures

23:19.272 --> 23:20.816
and all of our conversations,

23:20.899 --> 23:24.861
so everyone can see that behind
your pretty little rich-girl Instagram

23:24.945 --> 23:27.989
is a self-absorbed liar
who's completely full of shit.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.700
[Jena] Brooke please...

23:31.243 --> 23:36.123
She starts telling me that I, like,
better keep her happy, or else...

23:36.957 --> 23:40.794
[Jena] And I realized, all the stuff
that's been happening in school...

23:41.169 --> 23:42.003
it's her.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.589
I asked if she wanted, like, money,

23:44.965 --> 23:46.508
but she only wanted one thing.

23:48.468 --> 23:50.220
[Jena] And at this point,
like, I'm honestly,

23:50.303 --> 23:52.431
like, I'm afraid,
and I don't know what to do.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.099
So...

23:56.268 --> 23:57.477
I did the launcher.

23:59.062 --> 24:01.022
[Peter] Do you mind telling us
how you did it?

24:03.150 --> 24:04.943
Brooke sends me these coordinates.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.573
She tells me that I need to go
to this location.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.491
Look, dude, those are coordinates.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.119
[Jena] It turns out to be an alleyway.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.538
That's definitely poop, yeah.

24:16.746 --> 24:21.334
[Jena huffs] Like, my heart is just racing
and I get to this location,

24:21.960 --> 24:25.130
and there's a box
in the middle of the alleyway

24:25.213 --> 24:26.214
with my name on it.

24:26.339 --> 24:27.507
FRAGILE

24:27.591 --> 24:28.925
It was, like, really planned out.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.511
Like, this shit was truly next level.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.682
[huffs] And at this point, like,
I'm honestly scared.

24:35.765 --> 24:38.477
Like, what is this person capable of,
you know?

24:38.560 --> 24:41.062
[Jena] And, like, I know that I'm in
over my head at this point,

24:41.146 --> 24:42.606
but, like, what am I gonna do?

24:43.648 --> 24:44.733
And, like...

24:45.567 --> 24:47.194
these pictures that I sent her...

24:49.237 --> 24:50.280
they're, like...

24:51.239 --> 24:53.617
you know, like,
super suggestive photos,

24:53.700 --> 24:57.662
and, like, all of our conversations
are just, like, in this box,

24:57.746 --> 25:01.291
and, like, she knows
that I'm not gonna have any choice.

25:02.250 --> 25:04.836
She makes it real clear
that she's not fucking around,

25:04.920 --> 25:06.421
and I better do what she says.

25:06.755 --> 25:07.589
So,

25:08.548 --> 25:12.010
inside the box there's instructions
that tell me how to do it,

25:12.344 --> 25:15.639
and Ziploc bags
that are full of shit to use.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.058
Like, actual shit.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.101
[Jena] And, like, I'm just thinking,

25:20.185 --> 25:23.104
like, who is this person
that I thought I was in love with?

25:23.897 --> 25:25.440
She's some kind of monster.

25:26.983 --> 25:30.654
[Jena] During the pep rally walk-through,
the coach's office would be open

25:30.737 --> 25:32.739
and I was supposed to...

25:33.198 --> 25:36.243
replace the shirts that were in the cannon

25:36.326 --> 25:39.913
with, like, the Turd Burglar shirts.

25:41.540 --> 25:45.710
There's printed out instructions
telling me, like, how to roll the cat poop

25:45.835 --> 25:47.504
into these shirts,

25:48.338 --> 25:49.965
and she tells me to take a picture

25:50.048 --> 25:52.801
of the guns that are loaded
and send it to her.

25:53.969 --> 25:56.137
I mean, like, of course I did it.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.515
Like, what else was I supposed to do?
You know?

26:00.100 --> 26:01.977
[huffs] So I send her the picture

26:02.769 --> 26:04.521
and she fucking ghosts me.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.565
I JUST LOVE WHEN A PEP RALLY
BECOMES A (POOP) RALLY

26:07.148 --> 26:09.484
[Peter]
So, Brooke Wheeler is the Turd Burglar?

26:12.028 --> 26:12.862
Did...?

26:13.363 --> 26:14.239
Yeah.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.046
So,

26:30.755 --> 26:33.300
does the name Jenna Hawthorne
mean anything to you?

26:34.551 --> 26:35.385
No.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.972
Does the name Brooke Wheeler
mean anything to you?

26:39.848 --> 26:40.849
No.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.184
So, you're not Brooke Wheeler?

26:44.728 --> 26:47.147
No, I'm a Abby Samuels.

26:47.939 --> 26:49.608
Do you mind taking a look at this?

26:50.191 --> 26:51.401
Hey, Pickle.

26:51.484 --> 26:54.279
I'm going to bed
and I wanted to say goodnight.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.780
And I miss you.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.450
This is a private video

26:58.950 --> 27:00.785
that I snapped my boyfriend.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.539
Pickle is what I call him.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.542
Yeah, actually, that video,
along with these photos,

27:07.626 --> 27:09.461
were all private videos of yours,

27:09.544 --> 27:12.756
which actually made it really, really hard
to track you down.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.508
But, thankfully,

27:15.884 --> 27:17.844
we reverse image searched
all these photos

27:17.927 --> 27:19.596
and luckily one popped up.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.265
That's how we were able to find you.

27:25.518 --> 27:26.394
This is...

27:27.145 --> 27:29.022
really creepy. [flips through pages]

27:31.733 --> 27:35.278
Look, I didn't post these pictures
anywhere,

27:35.403 --> 27:36.321
so how did...?

27:37.280 --> 27:38.281
Eww.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.077
[Peter] I hate to tell you this,

27:42.160 --> 27:45.372
but, your photos have been used
by the Turd Burglar.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.419
What the fuck is a Turd Burglar?
