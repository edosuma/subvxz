WEBVTT

00:07.094 --> 00:08.747
Previously on <i>
Star Trek: Discovery...</i>

00:08.791 --> 00:10.271
<i>
Our ship is enclosed</i>

00:10.314 --> 00:11.707
<i>in a membrane</i> <i>
of unknown substance.</i>

00:11.750 --> 00:13.404
It appears to be an orb
of some kind.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.102
Tell Stamets to assemble a team

00:15.145 --> 00:17.191
and figure out a way
to get us out of this thing.

00:17.234 --> 00:19.280
The DMA could destroy
both of our worlds.

00:19.323 --> 00:21.108
They must be evacuating,
even now.

00:21.151 --> 00:22.413
The math doesn't lie.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.111
Most will not be saved.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.851
<i>We have a problem.</i>
- What is it?

00:25.895 --> 00:28.376
We have only 12 hours
before the DMA reaches Earth.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.856
Won't take nearly that long
to get us out of here.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.075
<i>
Where do I come in?</i>

00:32.119 --> 00:33.729
You'll hack <i>Discovery's</i> systems,

00:33.772 --> 00:35.687
and vent the plasma
through the starboard nacelle.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.472
<i>
We can't do this without you.</i>

00:37.515 --> 00:39.082
It's done.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.953
Just make sure you stop
the damn thing in time.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.521
I am not certain how
to step into danger with one

00:43.565 --> 00:45.306
for whom I have
such personal fondness.

00:45.349 --> 00:48.091
This is one of the reasons
I avoid closeness with others.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.266
Um...

00:49.310 --> 00:50.485
Something is coming.

00:50.528 --> 00:52.356
A life-form.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.184
They responded to
our expression of suffering

00:54.228 --> 00:55.838
with an expression
of great sadness.

00:55.881 --> 00:59.450
And if they have empathy for us,
diplomacy can work.

00:59.494 --> 01:02.279
- Your friend Tarka's gonna kill us all.
- I won't let you do this.

01:04.847 --> 01:06.153
<i>
I never wanted this, Book.</i>

01:06.196 --> 01:08.416
Never. 30 minutes left.

01:08.459 --> 01:10.374
<i>Then we're out of this orb</i> <i>
and on our way.</i>

01:11.288 --> 01:13.508
We just received an urgent
message from Booker's ship.

01:13.551 --> 01:14.944
<i>RENO</i> <i>
It's Reno.</i>

01:14.987 --> 01:16.554
<i>Tarka's got me and Book</i> <i>
locked up.</i>

01:16.598 --> 01:18.643
<i>If he takes out the DMA</i> <i>
the way he wants to,</i>

01:18.687 --> 01:20.950
<i>it'll destroy the hyperfield,</i> <i>
the Ten-C...</i>

01:20.993 --> 01:22.212
<i>probably</i> Discovery, <i>too.</i>

01:22.256 --> 01:24.432
<i>It'll also leave a toxic void,</i>

01:24.475 --> 01:26.782
<i>same as we got stuck in,</i> <i>
heading straight for Earth.</i>

01:26.825 --> 01:29.567
<i>You have to stop us,</i> <i>
whatever it takes.</i>

01:51.372 --> 01:53.417
<i>
Each deck of Federation</i> <i>
Headquarters is able</i>

01:53.461 --> 01:55.158
<i>to function independently...</i>

01:55.202 --> 01:56.551
...essentially as
its own life lifeboat,

01:56.594 --> 01:58.118
so don't waste any space.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.728
As soon as your deck is
filled to capacity,

01:59.771 --> 02:02.078
report to your CO,
who will detach and warp

02:02.122 --> 02:03.645
to Evacuation Base Gamma.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.212
We need to get
as many people to safety

02:05.255 --> 02:07.083
as quickly as possible.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.693
<i>Lieutenant Simms,</i> <i>
please report to shuttle bay.</i>

02:08.737 --> 02:10.478
People are scared.
They're losing everything.

02:10.521 --> 02:12.958
They're gonna be looking
to the Federation for guidance,

02:13.002 --> 02:15.787
for safety, for hope.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.920
We get to give that to them.

02:17.963 --> 02:20.270
<i>OPS OFFICER</i> <i>
Attention all personnel,</i> <i>
please stand by.</i>

02:20.314 --> 02:22.403
<i>We'll be dropping out of warp</i> <i>
in one minute.</i>

02:22.446 --> 02:24.448
All available officers are
on evac duty.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.189
Our job is to help them succeed.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.104
As of now,
you are no longer cadets.

02:28.148 --> 02:32.543
I know you may not feel ready,
but I assure you, you are.

02:32.587 --> 02:35.633
We can do this.

02:35.677 --> 02:38.419
Dismissed.
Gorev, Harral, you're with me.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.924
<i>
Deck 29's at capacity.</i>

03:05.968 --> 03:07.535
<i>Requesting permission to undock.</i>

03:07.578 --> 03:08.971
<i>
Permission granted.</i>

03:09.014 --> 03:10.581
<i>See you at the rendezvous point.</i>

03:17.719 --> 03:20.243
Admiral Vance.
Ni'Var has 17 ships

03:20.287 --> 03:22.027
heading to the evacuation base.

03:22.071 --> 03:24.987
Do you want me to bring them
here after they unload?

03:25.030 --> 03:26.771
No. They should stick
to the plan.

03:26.815 --> 03:29.731
Ni'Var only has
86 warp-capable ships as it is.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.994
- Yes, sir.
- How long do we have here, sir,

03:32.037 --> 03:35.215
- to help Earth?
- Four hours until the DMA starts to hit.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.520
Well, the <i>Mitchell</i> is at Titan;

03:36.564 --> 03:37.739
even with the entire colony
on board,

03:37.782 --> 03:38.957
they won't hit capacity.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.132
It's a good idea.

03:40.176 --> 03:41.221
When the <i>Mitchell's</i> done,

03:41.264 --> 03:42.657
get them back here to pick up

03:42.700 --> 03:43.658
as many additional refugees
as they can.

03:43.701 --> 03:44.746
Yes, sir.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.096
Excuse me, sir.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.707
I'm sorry, Admiral,
I was just wondering.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.579
How many can we save?

03:51.622 --> 03:53.015
Realistically?

03:53.058 --> 03:56.323
If first contact fails,
all off Titan.

03:56.366 --> 03:59.891
Maybe 450,000 off of Earth.
Same with Ni'Var.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.241
Best case.

04:01.284 --> 04:02.764
That's it?

04:05.506 --> 04:07.595
Please hurry, Michael.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.727
Where is Stamets on getting us
out of this orb?

04:09.771 --> 04:11.860
He's testing some theories,
nothing concrete yet.

04:11.903 --> 04:13.601
What about the Ten-C,
any response?

04:13.644 --> 04:16.125
Negative. Dr. Hirai is still
asking them to release us.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.692
Owosekun, what's the status
on Tarka?

04:17.735 --> 04:19.171
Scans show he's gaining speed,

04:19.215 --> 04:20.825
heading for
the DMA power source.

04:20.869 --> 04:23.263
It's encased within
a silicon-ellanium alloy.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.047
Same as the DMA controller itself.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.528
That alloy's incredibly
effective at containing energy,

04:27.571 --> 04:29.094
but it won't withstand
external forces.

04:29.138 --> 04:30.661
So whatever Tarka's planning...

04:30.705 --> 04:32.620
He's going to hit it
with the gravimetric beam.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.274
If the Ten-C think
they're under attack,

04:34.317 --> 04:36.101
they won't come back
and talk to us. Not in time.

04:36.145 --> 04:38.016
Ten-Cs just launched
another orb, Captain.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.975
Looks like they're trying
to capture Book's ship.

04:40.018 --> 04:42.064
Keep me posted.
Lieutenant Christopher,

04:42.107 --> 04:43.587
tell Commander Stamets
to test faster.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.372
I want us out of the orb,
whatever it takes.

04:45.415 --> 04:46.938
And have
the diplomatic personnel

04:46.982 --> 04:48.113
gather in the mess hall.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.289
Yes, Captain.

04:49.332 --> 04:50.638
Madam President,
if you'd join me?

04:50.681 --> 04:52.161
May I ask what you have in mind?

04:52.204 --> 04:53.641
I'm going to confine them all
to quarters.

04:53.684 --> 04:55.295
I think you should be there
when I tell them.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.821
<i>
The orbs will capture us again</i>

04:59.864 --> 05:01.649
<i>if we don't keep changing</i> <i>
our astrodynamics.</i>

05:01.692 --> 05:04.260
Where is
your presto chango button?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.349
I'm not helping you
with another damn thing.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.698
I don't understand.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.396
I'm doing exactly
what we said we'd do.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.920
- Nothing's changed.
- Everything's changed.

05:11.963 --> 05:14.618
The cost of this,
it has to be the last resort.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.272
You heard Ndoye, right?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.579
The first contact team is gone.

05:18.622 --> 05:19.841
They're in an orb.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.451
They could be dead
for all we know.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.932
No. They're talking
to the Ten-C. It could work.

05:24.846 --> 05:27.152
You once told me
anger can be productive.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.545
It can also blind you.

05:28.589 --> 05:30.199
I've been trying for ten years!

05:31.287 --> 05:33.202
I'm going home.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.160
I'm finding Oros.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.510
End of story.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.425
There it is.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.134
There's got to be
a way out of this.

05:52.177 --> 05:55.311
If I had
some hot and sour soup...

05:56.486 --> 05:59.315
Wouldn't help us,
I'm just hungry.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.186
The upside is,

06:01.230 --> 06:04.842
when we hit the hyperfield,
we'll be vaporized immediately.

06:04.886 --> 06:06.801
Where's the upside in that?

06:06.844 --> 06:09.107
We'll die fast. I hate pain.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.769
Or maybe we'll survive
after all.

06:21.642 --> 06:24.645
I'm sorry, Madam President,
but plasma doesn't vent itself.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.429
This entire mission
is compromised.

06:26.473 --> 06:29.301
There has to be a less public
way to handle this.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.086
It'll erode their trust
in one another.

06:31.129 --> 06:33.523
I can't let whoever did this
keep walking around my ship.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.307
Is this about the plasma vent?

06:35.351 --> 06:37.222
I'll fill you in
once everyone is here,

06:37.266 --> 06:38.833
but I'm gonna need
to lock you all down.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.443
That won't be necessary.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.445
I'm the one
who aided their escape.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.229
What?

06:44.273 --> 06:47.232
- Why would you...
- United Earth is running out of time,

06:47.276 --> 06:48.538
and you were all gone.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.192
We had no idea
where the orb went,

06:50.235 --> 06:52.412
when you'd be back,
or if you were even still alive.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.805
They can stop the DMA right now.
No, no.

06:54.849 --> 06:56.720
Billions of people
might still die.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.461
No, Mr. Booker assured me...

06:58.505 --> 07:00.550
Was that before
or after Tarka took him hostage?

07:04.859 --> 07:08.471
Communication with the Ten-C
was working, General.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.779
We think they would have
withdrawn the DMA in time.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.526
Officer Zena.

07:19.569 --> 07:22.659
Please confine General Ndoye
to her quarters.

07:24.269 --> 07:27.664
Captain. Madam President.

07:27.708 --> 07:30.319
I remain ready
and willing to serve.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.588
<i>SARU</i> <i>
Captain,</i>

07:38.632 --> 07:40.503
<i>we have received an answer</i> <i>
from the Ten-C.</i>

07:40.547 --> 07:42.244
What did they say?

07:42.287 --> 07:44.246
Well, it is rather bewildering.

07:44.289 --> 07:47.031
We have been asking them
to release us from the orb.

07:47.075 --> 07:50.165
They replied that we are
already free of it.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.428
Are we sure
the message was clear, Zora?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.474
<i>
For that particular exchange,</i> <i>
I estimate</i>

07:54.517 --> 07:57.128
<i>our accuracy to be</i> <i>
in the 96th percentile.</i>

07:57.172 --> 07:59.217
Could they be confused
about who sent it?

07:59.261 --> 08:02.264
More likely they presume we're
working with Booker and Tarka.

08:02.307 --> 08:03.918
We did arrive here together.

08:03.961 --> 08:07.182
Zora, can you communicate
that Tarka is acting on his own?

08:07.225 --> 08:10.446
<i>
The nuances of that could</i> <i>
take quite a long time.</i>

08:10.490 --> 08:12.230
If...

08:12.274 --> 08:15.059
I can connect with them telepathically,

08:15.103 --> 08:17.322
I may be able to convey
our desire to protect them.

08:17.366 --> 08:20.456
Madam President, linking with
an unknown species is dangerous

08:20.500 --> 08:23.067
in ways we cannot begin
to anticipate.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.243
We have less than four hours.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.419
Do we really have a choice?

08:42.478 --> 08:44.828
I have made contact.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.847
- Madam President.
- Break the link.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.980
T'Rina.
Break the link.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.808
We have to break it.
Break the link.

09:09.853 --> 09:11.159
Madam President?

09:11.202 --> 09:12.508
Madam President!

09:12.552 --> 09:13.596
Are you okay?

09:14.815 --> 09:15.946
What happened?

09:18.383 --> 09:21.604
They... they are confused.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.171
Terrified.

09:23.214 --> 09:26.870
They cannot stop Booker's ship,

09:26.914 --> 09:29.003
and they no longer trust us.

09:32.528 --> 09:36.184
We-we must find another way
to reach them,

09:36.227 --> 09:40.580
or I fear that our worlds
are already doomed.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.589
Heart rate and blood pressure
are still elevated,

11:17.633 --> 11:20.462
but her neural activity's
returning to normal.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.856
Madam President,

11:22.899 --> 11:24.945
is there anything else
you can tell us about them?

11:24.988 --> 11:28.383
The experience was...

11:30.080 --> 11:31.560
...unusual.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.605
Our connection, I...

11:33.649 --> 11:37.435
I was not feeling
one of the Ten-C

11:37.479 --> 11:39.742
but all of them.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.876
They're linked? Like the Borg?

11:42.919 --> 11:45.400
No. No, quite different.

11:45.443 --> 11:49.665
There was a sense of harmony
with one another.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.754
It's difficult to describe,

11:51.798 --> 11:54.931
but I believe
they may not have any awareness

11:54.975 --> 11:59.806
of individual existence
as we know it.

12:01.459 --> 12:03.200
We're running out of time
to help them understand.

12:03.244 --> 12:05.028
<i>STAMETS</i> <i>
Captain,</i>

12:05.072 --> 12:07.596
<i>I've got a way out of the orb,</i> <i>
but it won't be pretty.</i>

12:07.639 --> 12:09.511
We're on our way.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.730
Keep us posted.

12:20.827 --> 12:24.004
I apologize that I must go.

12:24.961 --> 12:28.617
Uh... before I do, if I may,

12:28.660 --> 12:32.447
what you said about avoiding
closeness with others...

12:32.490 --> 12:36.146
this possibility,

12:36.190 --> 12:38.801
it is the reason
I, too, have avoided

12:38.845 --> 12:43.153
a certain type of closeness
since leaving Kaminar.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.026
But I have come to believe that

12:46.069 --> 12:51.205
the limits I place upon myself
do not protect me

12:51.248 --> 12:56.079
so much as dull the brightness
of my days.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.736
Ah. In any event...

13:00.780 --> 13:02.085
Hmm.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.443
We made it.

13:12.487 --> 13:13.880
I just need the power source,

13:13.923 --> 13:15.011
and you two can go
back to <i>Discovery.</i>

13:15.055 --> 13:17.013
It'll be over in 15 minutes.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.929
Unless another orb chases us
into the hyperfield

13:19.973 --> 13:21.452
and we all die.

13:21.496 --> 13:22.889
The Ten-C wouldn't risk
getting this close

13:22.932 --> 13:24.281
to the plasma streams.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.414
Book, you hear that?

13:26.457 --> 13:28.459
- We're nearly there.
- I heard you.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.987
Look, I know we don't see
eye to eye on this, but...

13:34.030 --> 13:36.337
this doesn't just have to be
about my home.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.556
Kwejian will be there, too.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.123
You could come with me.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.082
You'll get your family back.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.519
Kyheem and Leto.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.738
No, he won't,

13:46.782 --> 13:48.218
because they're gone.

13:48.262 --> 13:51.569
Anyone in your universe
can look the same,

13:51.613 --> 13:54.877
laugh the same, want
their sandwiches cut diagonally

13:54.921 --> 13:57.488
with exactly two pickles
on the side...

13:59.839 --> 14:01.579
...but Kyheem isn't there.

14:01.623 --> 14:04.191
Neither is Leto,
or my wife,

14:04.234 --> 14:06.106
or anyone else we've lost.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.021
I never said it was them exactly,

14:08.064 --> 14:10.850
but... it is them.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.984
Buddy.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.420
Think of it.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.250
Reno's right.

14:21.425 --> 14:22.992
They're gone.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.910
So let me out of here

14:27.954 --> 14:31.218
before you do something
we're all going to regret.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.091
This will all be over soon.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.618
It sure as hell will.

14:42.142 --> 14:44.318
Good news is, I can get us out,

14:44.361 --> 14:46.059
and we should survive.

14:46.102 --> 14:49.627
- Should?
- Best I can do these days.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.630
Yeah, uh, we've been analyzing
the amount energy required

14:52.674 --> 14:54.937
for Booker's ship
to escape the orb.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.287
Now, considering <i>
Discovery's</i> much larger size,

14:57.331 --> 14:59.376
let's just say that
it would take a lot more

14:59.420 --> 15:00.987
for us to do the same.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.337
And, as of right now,
there is only one process

15:03.380 --> 15:04.991
that can discharge
that amount of energy

15:05.034 --> 15:07.123
without also killing us immediately.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.733
The spore drive.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.474
Normally, when we jump,

15:10.518 --> 15:14.565
the energy that's discharged
is converted into momentum

15:14.609 --> 15:16.567
that propels the ship
along the pathways

15:16.611 --> 15:17.960
of the mycelial network.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.702
But if we were
to remain stationary,

15:20.745 --> 15:22.747
all that stored-up energy
would have to find

15:22.791 --> 15:24.271
somewhere else to go.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.577
You're saying
it would release into the orb

15:26.621 --> 15:27.839
and break us out.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.580
Yes,

15:29.624 --> 15:32.322
but it would burn out
the spore drive in the process,

15:32.366 --> 15:36.413
which we won't be able to repair
without spacedock.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.241
Meaning we'd have to warp home.

15:38.285 --> 15:39.764
It would take decades.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.505
That's the bad news.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.384
Do it.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.999
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell that is?

15:57.043 --> 15:58.174
It's a cat collar.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.002
Grudge hates holos.

16:00.046 --> 16:03.223
Used to scare holo couriers,
so I had to install a disruptor,

16:03.266 --> 16:04.876
one that'll work rather nicely

16:04.920 --> 16:07.444
on a force field
generated by holo emitters.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.013
Ready?

16:11.057 --> 16:13.885
Is this where I get to say
I was born ready?

16:20.588 --> 16:22.546
A cat door.

16:22.590 --> 16:23.983
You can thank me later.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.203
Commander Stamets, are you set?

16:27.247 --> 16:28.509
Spore drive's active.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.293
<i>Ready to jump on your mark.</i>

16:30.337 --> 16:33.209
Dr. Hirai,
any word back from the Ten-C?

16:33.253 --> 16:34.906
<i>
I repeated the message</i> <i>
that we're trying to help.</i>

16:34.950 --> 16:37.039
<i>Not much more we can do</i> <i>
if they won't answer.</i>

16:37.083 --> 16:39.737
Okay. Black alert.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.826
Let's get the hell out of here.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.225
<i>- Commander Stamets!</i>
- Spore drive's holding,

16:49.269 --> 16:52.576
but power throughput's
nearing capacity.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.926
We've got minor hull breaches
on multiple decks.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.363
No injuries reported.

16:56.406 --> 16:57.929
What about the orb?

16:57.973 --> 16:59.235
No changes yet.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.023
Captain, our entire E.P.S. grid

17:04.066 --> 17:05.415
<i>is about to overload.</i>

17:05.459 --> 17:07.243
Do not stop it.
This is our only shot.

17:22.258 --> 17:23.303
Ah!

17:33.269 --> 17:34.705
We're out of the orb.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.055
Impulse engines are back up
and running.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.839
Warp drive is gonna
take a while.

17:37.882 --> 17:38.927
So will weapons systems.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.537
Spore drive's down, as expected.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.104
Any other orbs on the way?

17:42.148 --> 17:45.629
None. Seems
they're letting us go.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.153
Maybe we can

17:47.196 --> 17:48.850
turn this around after all.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.724
Exiting the gas giant now, Captain.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.118
Get us back to Book's ship
as fast as you can.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.902
The Ten-C won't talk to us
until we stop Tarka.

17:57.946 --> 17:59.643
Aye, Captain.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.124
Tarka.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.825
Here's to holo disruptors.

18:07.869 --> 18:10.480
Think I might actually start
to like that cat of yours.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.396
I can't get into the system.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.746
It's on autopilot. Ten minutes
until I get to the power source

18:15.790 --> 18:17.226
and the hyperfield goes boom.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.445
There's no way
we're gonna be able

18:18.488 --> 18:20.447
to override the system in time.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.101
Damn it. We're locked
out of comms, too.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.103
So much for calling in
the cavalry.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.151
Hey. Take my badge.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.545
Beam back to <i>Discovery,</i>
tell them what's happening.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.634
I'm gonna stay with him
and find a way to stop this.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.811
Tell Michael I love her.

18:36.854 --> 18:41.163
And whatever she has to do,
it's okay.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.773
<i>
Book's ship back</i> <i>
in range, Captain.</i>

18:42.817 --> 18:44.688
Can you get us any closer?

18:44.732 --> 18:46.081
Not with those plasma bursts.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.517
Captain, someone's
beaming aboard.

18:47.561 --> 18:50.825
I've got a lock.
It's Commander Reno.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.392
Bring her to the bridge.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.266
Commander, are you okay?

18:57.310 --> 18:58.572
Better than Boy Genius.

18:58.615 --> 18:59.877
He'll be through
to the power source

18:59.921 --> 19:02.097
in the next ten, just FYI.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.229
Rhys?

19:03.272 --> 19:04.752
Still getting weapons on line.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.057
I'll see if I can
help with that.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.538
The man loves you.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.758
He said do whatever it takes.

19:15.241 --> 19:17.199
Okay. We need options.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.027
Can we transport them back here?

19:19.070 --> 19:20.985
Booker's ship is protected
by a pattern interrupter.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.726
I can't get a lock
unless they choose to leave.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.032
What about a tractor beam?

19:24.075 --> 19:25.555
Pull them away
from the casement?

19:25.599 --> 19:27.209
Only if they stop
their gravimetric beam first.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.472
Otherwise, we could destroy
the hyperfield ourselves.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.431
Captain, if I may?

19:31.474 --> 19:35.565
General Ndoye has a singular
mind for military tactics.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.219
She did offer to help.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.483
What am I looking at,
Lieutenant?

19:40.527 --> 19:42.181
We have incoming.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.618
Uh, near-Earth debris pushed
by gravitational waves

19:44.661 --> 19:46.228
at 2,100 kilometers per second.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.795
That's the DMA.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.362
Tell Earth to raise
their shields.

19:49.405 --> 19:53.975
Attention all personnel,
prepare for incoming.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.498
Transport shuttles,
continue evacuations.

19:55.542 --> 19:57.631
All others,
defensive formation Omega.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.894
We'll hold the line
as long as we can.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.515
Who was that?

20:12.559 --> 20:14.430
It's the USS <i>Mitchell,</i> sir.
They made it.

20:14.474 --> 20:16.432
Remind me to give their captain
a commendation

20:16.476 --> 20:18.652
if we ever make it
out of this alive.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.654
- Is the president off-world?
- No, sir.

20:20.697 --> 20:22.351
She's helping
with the evacuation.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.223
She said she won't leave
until the last possible moment.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.877
Make sure the evac captain

20:26.921 --> 20:28.923
gets her in a shuttle
before pulling out.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.927
Admiral, Deck Five
is at full capacity.

20:32.970 --> 20:35.190
Tell them to get out
while they still can.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.236
- Yes, sir.
- We're running out of time.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.240
I presume you've considered
the obvious.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.242
Tractor beam and the like.
We have.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.939
What about a targeted hit?

20:44.982 --> 20:47.028
We could send a shuttle
on autopilot.

20:47.071 --> 20:49.117
Gravimetric flux
would disrupt navigation.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.902
Somebody would have to be on
the controls to stay on target.

20:51.946 --> 20:54.209
I don't think I could
beam them out in time.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.863
It's a suicide mission.

20:55.906 --> 20:58.344
And there's no way
Book and Tarka would survive.

20:58.387 --> 21:03.087
If we don't stop Tarka, the
Ten-C will never stop the DMA.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.786
Earth and Ni'Var
may already be getting hit.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.577
We'll need a great pilot.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.719
I'm ready, Captain.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.024
Let me do it.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.290
General?

21:31.333 --> 21:34.031
I have years of experience
as a combat pilot.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.731
United Earth is my home.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.950
Its citizens are my family.

21:39.994 --> 21:43.519
I've spent the last 20 years
fighting to protect both.

21:43.563 --> 21:47.001
That is where my decision to
help Booker and Tarka came from.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.525
Whether or not you would have
made the same choice,

21:49.569 --> 21:51.875
you must understand it.

21:58.404 --> 22:02.582
Owosekun, prepare to beam
the general to shuttle bay.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.506
If I don't make it back,

22:13.549 --> 22:16.465
please tell the president
I gave my all for Earth.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.859
I will.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.091
Status report.

22:34.135 --> 22:35.876
Bridge propulsion systems
just went down, Admiral.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.834
We're stuck.

22:37.878 --> 22:39.401
Pathfinder and <i>Tikhov</i>
both report shields

22:39.445 --> 22:40.402
below ten percent.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.317
OFFICER 2:
Sir!

22:42.361 --> 22:43.492
The <i>Credence</i> is leaving now.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.233
The <i>Nog's</i> still not at capacity,

22:45.276 --> 22:46.539
but they're taking hits
and won't last much longer.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.192
With all the debris coming in,

22:48.236 --> 22:50.020
we're gonna start losing ships
sooner than later.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.719
<i>...USS</i> Yelchin. <i>
Evacuation orders are complete.</i>

22:52.762 --> 22:54.242
<i>See you on the other side.</i>

22:54.285 --> 22:57.463
This is Admiral Charles Vance.

22:57.506 --> 23:00.814
All remaining vessels,

23:00.857 --> 23:03.077
cease evacuation efforts.

23:03.120 --> 23:06.385
Depart Earth and her moon immediately.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.212
I'll provide covering fire
for you

23:08.256 --> 23:10.214
for as long as I possibly can.

23:12.956 --> 23:15.219
<i>USS</i> Greco, <i>
confirming all navigation...</i>

23:15.263 --> 23:16.960
Thank you all for your bravery.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.226
Abandon ship.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.185
Aye, aye, Captain.

23:24.228 --> 23:26.579
Report to the <i>Mitchell</i> immediately.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.674
You both did a great job today.

23:34.717 --> 23:36.545
I just wish
we could've done more.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.460
Oh! My God.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.331
I know. Me, too.

23:48.514 --> 23:51.821
Go. Go.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.606
See you on the <i>Mitchell.</i>

23:57.914 --> 24:00.177
<i>Federation HQ,</i> <i>
this is the USS</i> Mitchell.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.136
<i>Jumping to</i> <i>
the rendezvous point now.</i>

24:02.179 --> 24:04.268
<i>Good luck, Admiral.</i>

24:12.407 --> 24:14.191
Lieutenant, what are you doing?

24:14.235 --> 24:16.455
Helping you with covering fire.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.369
Those are my cadets out there.

24:18.413 --> 24:21.329
This was all for nothing if
the ships can't actually leave.

24:21.372 --> 24:24.027
Once they get clear, we won't
be able to transport over.

24:24.071 --> 24:25.942
I know, sir.

24:30.338 --> 24:31.774
Come on, damn it, wake up.

24:31.818 --> 24:33.167
Four minutes to casement breach.

24:33.210 --> 24:35.386
Come on, come on.
I've tried everything.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.692
Tell me how to stop it.

24:36.736 --> 24:38.781
I can't do that.

24:38.825 --> 24:40.261
Would Oros want this?

24:40.304 --> 24:42.524
We're almost home.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.484
He won't be there.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.356
- You have to know that.
- Stop.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.358
He's gone, Tarka.

24:50.401 --> 24:52.142
- You don't know that!
- Hey.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.536
I understand, okay?

24:54.580 --> 24:56.451
I do.

24:58.584 --> 25:03.676
It's painful,
the hole they leave behind.

25:03.719 --> 25:06.287
Leto. Kyheem.

25:06.330 --> 25:09.769
Some days, I don't know
even how to wake up.

25:09.812 --> 25:12.380
Love always ends in grief.

25:12.423 --> 25:15.775
But we can't let the pain
do this to us.

25:17.777 --> 25:21.737
He'd have done
what you're doing right now.

25:24.044 --> 25:27.569
- He'd have stopped me.
- Yeah, I know.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.746
Why isn't he here to stop me?

25:30.790 --> 25:34.576
<i>
60 seconds to casement breach.</i>

25:34.620 --> 25:36.622
I'm sorry.

25:36.665 --> 25:39.102
- What?
- I'm so sorry.

25:39.146 --> 25:41.235
I used the recursive
fractal encryption key.

25:41.278 --> 25:43.716
I can't stop this in time.

25:43.759 --> 25:47.067
<i>
Warning. Proximity alert.</i>

26:02.604 --> 26:04.519
<i>
They've nearly reached</i> <i>
the power source.</i>

26:04.563 --> 26:06.608
I'll get there in time, Captain.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.436
We're with you, Diatta.

26:08.479 --> 26:09.916
<i>
I know you are, Laira.</i>

26:09.959 --> 26:11.613
<i>If I don't make it,</i>

26:11.657 --> 26:13.310
please save them.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.574
Save our home.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.619
Get ready, Owosekun.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.578
Aye, Captain.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.940
She did it, Captain.
The hyperfield is safe.

26:33.983 --> 26:35.855
And I've got General Ndoye.

26:35.898 --> 26:38.074
Good. Beam her
straight to sickbay.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.902
Are there any life signs
on Book's ship?

26:39.946 --> 26:42.252
Two. They both made it.

26:42.296 --> 26:44.559
See if you can beam them
on board as well.

26:44.603 --> 26:45.778
The hit may have taken out
their pattern interrupter.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.954
I'm trying. I can't get a lock.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.172
They don't have
much time, Captain.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.173
They're on a collision course

26:50.217 --> 26:51.261
with the hyperfield.

27:05.145 --> 27:07.321
<i>
90 seconds to impact.</i>

27:14.981 --> 27:16.852
Hyperfield will destroy us.

27:18.811 --> 27:20.682
We have to beam back
to <i>Discovery.</i>

27:20.726 --> 27:22.771
There's not enough power.

27:29.038 --> 27:31.693
<i>
Life support terminated.</i>

27:31.737 --> 27:32.999
What are you doing?

27:33.042 --> 27:35.697
I'm leaving enough
to transport you.

27:35.741 --> 27:39.092
No, we're both
getting out of this.

27:39.135 --> 27:40.833
<i>60 seconds to impact.</i>
- Listen to me.

27:40.876 --> 27:42.791
Listen, hey, hey.

27:42.835 --> 27:45.228
Michael is in this world, Book.

27:46.273 --> 27:48.014
Your life is in this world.

27:48.057 --> 27:51.757
Mine belongs to Kayalise.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.628
Or a place beyond it.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.413
Maybe the transporter
I built will work.

27:56.457 --> 28:01.070
Maybe the impact will be enough
to get me there.

28:01.114 --> 28:03.725
Maybe I'll see Oros again.

28:03.769 --> 28:06.162
I won't leave you here to die.

28:08.295 --> 28:10.036
Goodbye, Book.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.960
<i>
30 seconds to impact.</i>

28:42.590 --> 28:44.157
I have a new
transport signature.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.854
Book. It's faint.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.856
- Can you get him?
- Working on it.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.466
Locking on.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.730
Bring him straight
to the bridge.

29:06.919 --> 29:09.312
Did we...?

29:09.356 --> 29:10.618
Did...

29:17.233 --> 29:19.583
No.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.167
Captain.

29:38.211 --> 29:40.343
Another orb is coming.

29:58.057 --> 30:01.190
Let's go finish this.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.844
Prepare to reenter the orb.

30:21.036 --> 30:22.733
Well, we lost the last
of the weapons systems,

30:22.777 --> 30:25.214
but, uh, all our ships
made it safely

30:25.258 --> 30:26.781
- to the rendezvous point.
- Oh.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.653
So I thought we should
celebrate that, at least.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.614
Whiskey?

30:33.657 --> 30:35.268
Yeah, it's from Risa.

30:35.311 --> 30:36.617
Tarka gave it to me when
we finished the new spacedock.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.838
Mm. What a sweetheart
that guy is.

30:41.970 --> 30:45.495
Oh, I, um, I programmed the DOTS

30:45.539 --> 30:47.323
to reinforce
the deflector arrays

30:47.367 --> 30:50.109
and rerouted all power
to the shields,

30:50.152 --> 30:51.893
so toilets might
not flush anymore,

30:51.937 --> 30:54.940
but we might buy Earth
a little bit more time.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.985
Oh!

31:00.423 --> 31:02.382
How much time do we have?

31:03.644 --> 31:06.908
According to the gravitational
lensing I saw...

31:06.952 --> 31:10.042
two hours until the DMA
really gets us.

31:10.085 --> 31:12.348
That's more than enough
time to get bogged down

31:12.392 --> 31:14.481
with life's greatest regrets,
right?

31:18.964 --> 31:21.880
I'm actually pretty happy
with how my life went.

31:23.185 --> 31:26.493
I made some friends
who became my family.

31:26.536 --> 31:29.365
I got to see and do
incredible things.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.063
This, uh,

31:31.106 --> 31:33.239
this one sunset,

31:33.282 --> 31:36.024
my first boyfriend and I,
we skipped our biology lecture

31:36.068 --> 31:38.897
and climbed up on the roof
of the academy just to see it.

31:41.508 --> 31:44.685
Well, I'm glad you never
ditched engineering.

31:48.950 --> 31:52.258
Some people never find their
purpose in life, you know?

31:52.301 --> 31:55.130
I'm grateful I found mine.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.306
Yeah, me, too.

31:59.265 --> 32:01.484
I just wish
I fulfilled it better.

32:03.269 --> 32:06.011
My daughter.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.752
I wish I spent more time
with my daughter.

32:10.102 --> 32:11.930
Does she know you love her?

32:11.973 --> 32:14.933
Of course.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.674
More than anything.

32:17.718 --> 32:21.809
My mom and I didn't have
an easy relationship at all,

32:21.852 --> 32:25.813
but I always knew she loved me.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.902
That's the most important thing.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.775
That's what I remember.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.868
Commander Detmer, where are we?

32:37.912 --> 32:39.174
Still descending.

32:39.218 --> 32:40.654
Heading deeper
into the gas giant.

32:40.697 --> 32:42.308
Scans show we're approaching
a structure

32:42.351 --> 32:43.657
of massive proportions.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.441
Like on their homeworld?

32:45.485 --> 32:47.487
Maybe.

32:47.530 --> 32:48.836
Wherever they're taking us,

32:48.879 --> 32:50.403
there are thousands
of life signs.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.495
<i>
Captain, we are receiving</i>

32:55.538 --> 32:57.062
<i>a new message from the Ten-C.</i>

32:57.105 --> 33:01.240
"We now understand your request
to leave the orb.

33:01.283 --> 33:03.677
"You are not one.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.896
How many are you?"

33:05.940 --> 33:08.812
<i>
They're also asking us</i> <i>
to join them.</i>

33:08.856 --> 33:11.032
They say they'll send transport.

33:11.076 --> 33:12.599
<i>Same as before.</i>

33:12.642 --> 33:15.384
Mr. Saru, Dr. Harai,
meet us in shuttle bay.

33:15.428 --> 33:18.083
Zora, join us there as well.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.346
And all of you,

33:20.389 --> 33:21.825
we don't have much time left.

33:21.869 --> 33:24.132
We should all be there for this.

34:43.516 --> 34:45.779
Uh, Commander Stamets,
are we ready?

34:45.822 --> 34:47.737
<i>
Uh, just about.</i>

34:47.781 --> 34:51.132
Saru's device will continue
beaming our hydrocarbons

34:51.176 --> 34:53.134
onto the orb's surface.

34:53.178 --> 34:55.745
<i>But given the size of the space,</i>

34:55.789 --> 34:58.313
Zora will need to generate
the light map.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.272
<i>
I'm joining you now, Captain.</i>

35:00.315 --> 35:01.838
<i>
We'll keep working together</i>

35:01.882 --> 35:04.189
<i>and calibrate</i> <i>
as we go back and forth.</i>

35:04.232 --> 35:05.625
Thank you.

35:05.668 --> 35:08.193
<i>All of you.</i>
I am, uh, sending

35:08.236 --> 35:11.718
the updated language algorithm
to the device now, Captain.

35:14.199 --> 35:16.723
I thought you'd be down on
the surface with everyone else.

35:16.766 --> 35:18.638
After what happened
with Book...

35:22.207 --> 35:24.165
...I want to be with my family.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.993
I'm glad you're here.

35:27.342 --> 35:29.475
<i>
Captain, Madam President,</i>

35:29.518 --> 35:32.434
we are receiving a new message.

35:32.478 --> 35:35.481
The map should arrive momentarily.

35:39.528 --> 35:41.095
And there it is.

35:42.575 --> 35:45.708
Th-They are repeating
their query from before.

35:45.752 --> 35:48.842
"We understand now
that you are not one.

35:48.885 --> 35:50.713
How many are you?"

35:50.757 --> 35:52.411
What would you like me to say?

35:55.414 --> 35:57.198
Tell them

35:57.242 --> 36:02.595
each of us
is an individual "one."

36:02.638 --> 36:06.338
We are also one as a whole.

36:06.381 --> 36:10.037
Our appearances
and experiences differ,

36:10.080 --> 36:13.780
yet we all seek
happiness, freedom,

36:13.823 --> 36:17.697
security, equality.

36:17.740 --> 36:20.221
We want that for our children.

36:20.265 --> 36:23.224
Just as you do for yours.

36:23.268 --> 36:26.967
There is so much that unites us.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.973
They're sending a reply.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.372
They are asking about

36:40.415 --> 36:43.810
the others who were trying
to breach the casement.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.815
Tell them...

36:49.816 --> 36:52.906
...they were once
connected to us.

36:52.949 --> 36:55.735
Part of the whole.

36:56.736 --> 36:59.173
And then they separated.

37:05.614 --> 37:08.226
They would like to know why.

37:16.321 --> 37:20.150
One of them had someone...

37:22.109 --> 37:24.154
...his "one,"

37:24.198 --> 37:27.636
and he lost him long ago.

37:27.680 --> 37:31.292
He believed the power source
would reunite them.

37:31.336 --> 37:34.382
And the other...

37:37.037 --> 37:41.346
...your device
destroyed his planet.

37:43.522 --> 37:45.350
It killed his family.

37:47.352 --> 37:50.616
He didn't want anyone else
to experience that.

37:53.967 --> 37:56.752
"Is that why you are here?"

37:57.797 --> 37:59.320
Yes.

37:59.364 --> 38:02.280
That loss is about
to happen again.

38:02.323 --> 38:05.021
To all of us.

38:05.065 --> 38:08.938
We experienced your fear

38:08.982 --> 38:11.245
and your pain,

38:11.289 --> 38:13.987
when you had to leave
your former home.

38:14.030 --> 38:18.339
When so many of your loved ones
were left behind.

38:18.383 --> 38:21.908
And that is what
we are feeling right now.

38:21.951 --> 38:25.520
You have to stop your device.

38:25.564 --> 38:30.351
Otherwise it will destroy
our planets as well.

38:30.395 --> 38:33.267
And billions will die.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.922
Do not let history repeat.

38:46.759 --> 38:48.238
They said...

38:52.417 --> 38:57.335
Did the DMA just... stop?

38:59.337 --> 39:01.121
They said they will
move it away.

39:05.168 --> 39:07.736
And there goes the debris field.

39:16.615 --> 39:20.227
Reno, are you hearing this?
They stopped the DMA.

39:20.270 --> 39:23.143
<i>
I'm already making</i> <i>
a cocktail, Bobcat.</i>

39:24.579 --> 39:26.059
"Bobcat"?

39:27.408 --> 39:30.237
It's a, it's a good nickname.

39:31.238 --> 39:32.370
Okay.

39:47.907 --> 39:51.084
They feel your sadness, Captain,

39:51.127 --> 39:52.825
but they do not understand.

39:52.868 --> 39:55.480
They say, "Your home is safe.

39:55.523 --> 39:59.353
Billions of 'ones' are safe."

40:00.963 --> 40:03.401
They ask why you feel this way.

40:08.362 --> 40:11.278
The two people
who separated from us,

40:11.321 --> 40:14.324
that died today,

40:14.368 --> 40:17.502
one of them I loved very deeply.

40:19.504 --> 40:20.940
He was...

40:22.898 --> 40:24.944
He was my "one."

40:50.578 --> 40:52.406
Where am I?

40:54.495 --> 40:56.497
What happened?

41:03.765 --> 41:05.506
- Did it work?
- Yeah.

41:05.550 --> 41:06.725
Is Earth and Ni'Var safe?

41:06.768 --> 41:07.769
- They are.
- Yeah?

41:07.813 --> 41:09.423
Are you real?

41:09.467 --> 41:11.251
- Yeah.
- Oh...

41:14.341 --> 41:15.516
He's alive.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.878
That's them.

41:35.449 --> 41:37.538
Can I talk to them?

41:38.713 --> 41:40.933
Saru will translate.

41:42.021 --> 41:44.545
How am I even here?

41:47.940 --> 41:51.334
"We intercepted
your transportation signal.

41:51.378 --> 41:52.858
"We did not understand
its nature

41:52.901 --> 41:56.252
"but presumed its importance,

41:56.296 --> 41:58.167
"given the timing
of its appearance,

41:58.211 --> 42:00.126
so we held it in stasis."

42:00.169 --> 42:04.957
And the DMA,
is it gone for good?

42:06.045 --> 42:07.873
"We did not realize

42:07.916 --> 42:10.223
"you were higher life-forms.

42:10.266 --> 42:14.532
"In the future,
we will scan more broadly.

42:14.575 --> 42:18.884
We will only operate
in uninhabited areas of space."

42:18.927 --> 42:20.102
No.

42:20.146 --> 42:22.496
That's not good enough.

42:23.497 --> 42:25.238
It's not enough

42:25.281 --> 42:27.457
to stop destroying lives.

42:27.501 --> 42:30.983
The DMA always leaves behind
a toxic mess.

42:31.026 --> 42:33.333
You have to shut it off
for good.

42:33.376 --> 42:36.684
That is the start
of making things right.

42:39.774 --> 42:43.604
Well, they said if they do that,
they would not be able to...

42:43.648 --> 42:45.606
I do not understand the word.

42:45.650 --> 42:47.565
<i>They seem to be referring</i> <i>
to the hyperfield.</i>

42:47.608 --> 42:48.957
<i>"We would not</i>

42:49.001 --> 42:50.524
<i>"be able to power it.</i>

42:50.568 --> 42:52.613
<i>That would make us unsafe."</i>

42:52.657 --> 42:54.833
Hiding behind a wall
may calm your fears,

42:54.876 --> 42:56.617
but it won't keep you safe.

42:56.661 --> 42:59.011
The void
will eventually reach you.

42:59.054 --> 43:01.491
We all live in the same space.

43:01.535 --> 43:05.147
This is all there is.

43:05.191 --> 43:09.412
On my home, we had an organism.

43:09.456 --> 43:11.545
The World Root.

43:11.589 --> 43:14.113
It connected all life
on Kwejian.

43:14.156 --> 43:16.289
Wherever we lived,
whatever village or continent,

43:16.332 --> 43:18.596
it reminded us
we were all on the same planet.

43:19.684 --> 43:23.731
Our fates always interconnected.

43:23.775 --> 43:26.560
Maybe that's the lesson.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.519
If there is one.

43:29.563 --> 43:33.045
That is true of all of us.

43:33.088 --> 43:35.395
We've lost so many.

43:35.438 --> 43:36.744
You and me.

43:37.658 --> 43:41.531
But we can't do harm
in their names or memories.

43:44.056 --> 43:46.493
We have to honor them.

43:46.536 --> 43:48.582
All of them.

43:50.540 --> 43:52.717
Because they were beloved.

43:56.111 --> 43:57.722
Beautiful.

44:31.930 --> 44:33.845
They're sending a new message.

44:39.372 --> 44:42.680
"We have caused great harm.

44:42.723 --> 44:46.988
"We are filled
with regret and sorrow.

44:47.032 --> 44:50.688
We will make this right."

45:10.838 --> 45:12.622
They did it.

45:12.666 --> 45:16.844
They sure did.

45:38.170 --> 45:39.911
Commander Rhys,

45:39.954 --> 45:41.782
cancel red alert.

45:41.826 --> 45:43.741
Aye, Captain.

46:06.198 --> 46:07.939
Scans show a wormhole forming.

46:07.982 --> 46:11.943
It's approaching at a rate
of 15 kilometers a second.

46:11.986 --> 46:14.380
They are using the DMA wormhole

46:14.423 --> 46:16.774
one last time.

46:21.691 --> 46:23.737
We're going home.

46:55.551 --> 46:57.162
I am pleased that the damage

46:57.205 --> 47:00.730
to United Earth and Ni'Var
was not more severe.

47:02.602 --> 47:04.517
Titan got it the worst,
but Earth's already there.

47:04.560 --> 47:07.433
Everyone's coming together
to help them rebuild. It's...

47:07.476 --> 47:10.523
We have come a long way, Captain.

47:11.916 --> 47:13.918
Indeed, we have.

47:17.312 --> 47:20.707
Oh.

47:20.750 --> 47:23.405
What? Tilly!

47:27.409 --> 47:29.237
I love you. I missed you.

47:37.637 --> 47:40.335
- Admiral.
- Madam President.

47:40.379 --> 47:44.296
Thank you
for carrying us through.

47:44.339 --> 47:48.082
Well, I'd say we were both
exactly where we needed to be.

47:48.126 --> 47:50.476
Yeah.

47:50.519 --> 47:51.999
None of this
would have been happening

47:52.043 --> 47:53.609
the last time that I saw you.

47:53.653 --> 47:55.655
It's still
a little hard sometimes,

47:55.698 --> 47:57.091
but it's okay.

47:57.135 --> 47:58.919
Okay, but you're doing great.

47:58.963 --> 48:00.399
And then, you know,
the times that it's hard,

48:00.442 --> 48:02.705
that's what family's for.

48:23.726 --> 48:26.164
I hope I'm not interrupting.

48:26.207 --> 48:28.775
Not at all.

48:31.778 --> 48:34.128
I was just thinking
about Ni'Var.

48:34.172 --> 48:35.956
Ah.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.699
You must be eager
to return home.

48:39.742 --> 48:41.744
I am.

48:42.745 --> 48:44.573
And I am grateful

48:44.617 --> 48:46.314
that we no longer need to worry.

48:47.272 --> 48:49.317
As am I.

48:52.190 --> 48:55.671
I have been considering
what you shared earlier.

48:57.630 --> 48:59.893
I have long told myself
that balancing duty

48:59.937 --> 49:03.027
and personal relationships
was not possible.

49:05.116 --> 49:09.468
I believe now that I was
being dishonest with myself.

49:09.511 --> 49:13.298
It is possible, if difficult.

49:13.341 --> 49:17.258
However, it is worth the effort

49:17.302 --> 49:20.870
for the right individual.

49:26.702 --> 49:31.533
When I feared
we may not survive,

49:31.577 --> 49:33.318
my greatest regret

49:33.361 --> 49:35.668
was that I had not spent
more time with you,

49:35.711 --> 49:37.975
Madam President.

49:38.018 --> 49:39.759
Please.

49:39.802 --> 49:43.328
You must call me T'Rina.

49:44.329 --> 49:47.071
T'Rina.

50:08.918 --> 50:10.355
Come.

50:17.188 --> 50:19.755
It's a hell of a thing,

50:19.799 --> 50:21.627
the Ten-C.

50:21.670 --> 50:23.629
It makes me wonder
about all the other beings

50:23.672 --> 50:25.109
we've never met.

50:25.152 --> 50:27.633
There's still so much to learn

50:27.676 --> 50:31.550
about our one small corner
of the universe.

50:31.593 --> 50:33.552
Hmm.

50:33.595 --> 50:35.945
Oh, how's your family?
Is your partner okay?

50:35.989 --> 50:37.208
All safe.

50:37.251 --> 50:39.123
Thankfully.

50:39.166 --> 50:40.776
He was evacuated from the moon

50:40.820 --> 50:42.865
with the rest
of the research team.

50:42.909 --> 50:45.085
And my family stayed on Earth,

50:45.129 --> 50:47.783
but they escaped
the worst of it.

50:53.789 --> 50:57.097
You have come a long way

50:57.141 --> 50:59.752
since we first stood here.

50:59.795 --> 51:02.537
The Kobayashi Maru conversation.

51:02.581 --> 51:06.628
Mm. I told you you weren't ready
for a <i>Voyager</i> captaincy.

51:07.760 --> 51:09.979
You are now.

51:10.023 --> 51:11.459
Thank you.

51:14.027 --> 51:16.116
I still wouldn't take it, ma'am.

51:22.470 --> 51:23.950
So...

51:24.951 --> 51:27.649
What happens with him?

51:27.693 --> 51:29.347
With Book?

51:29.390 --> 51:33.394
He violated
multiple Federation statutes.

51:33.438 --> 51:36.702
He launched an isolytic weapon.
It's...

51:36.745 --> 51:39.705
- It's a long list.
- And I am not asking for leniency.

51:39.748 --> 51:41.620
I know.

51:41.663 --> 51:44.144
But reasons do matter.

51:45.580 --> 51:47.843
It's the only way
justice can ever be just.

51:52.587 --> 51:54.546
I got the news about my future.

51:56.722 --> 51:58.637
Could you give us a minute,
please?

51:58.680 --> 52:01.118
We're beaming him back
to his shuttle in five.

52:02.858 --> 52:05.774
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

52:07.689 --> 52:08.821
You okay?

52:08.864 --> 52:10.301
Yeah.

52:18.700 --> 52:20.963
What did they say?

52:21.007 --> 52:24.967
Federation's sending me to help
families displaced by the DMA.

52:25.011 --> 52:27.448
Not sure for how long,
but I know where I'll be.

52:31.365 --> 52:33.585
How do you feel about it?

52:33.628 --> 52:36.240
I'll miss the freedom
of my ship,

52:36.283 --> 52:38.677
but all things considered...

52:40.592 --> 52:42.724
I heard my own voice

52:42.768 --> 52:45.205
when I was talking to the Ten-C.

52:45.249 --> 52:48.208
About not causing harm.

52:49.253 --> 52:51.168
I'm sorry, Michael.

52:58.392 --> 53:00.916
It'll be nice to be of use, though.

53:03.963 --> 53:07.140
- Book, I don't know how to say bye.
- We don't.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.534
We say <i>"Kwakoni Yiquan."</i>

53:09.577 --> 53:12.319
It's a Kwejian term
used only amongst hunters

53:12.363 --> 53:14.495
with the tightest of bonds.

53:14.539 --> 53:16.889
It means something like,

53:16.932 --> 53:20.066
"We've parted a hundred times.

53:20.109 --> 53:23.548
May we rejoin
to part a hundred more."

53:24.592 --> 53:27.116
<i>Kwakoni Yiquan</i> it is.

53:27.160 --> 53:29.249
<i>Kwakoni Yiquan.</i>

53:29.293 --> 53:30.642
I said it right the first time.

53:30.685 --> 53:32.383
Mm-mm.

53:34.385 --> 53:37.562
I love you, you know.

53:37.605 --> 53:40.391
I love you more.

53:42.828 --> 53:44.786
I first knew it

53:44.830 --> 53:46.658
when we were
in that terrible scrap

53:46.701 --> 53:49.617
in Tiburon. It was so cold.
Do you remember?

53:49.661 --> 53:51.402
- Yeah, but it wasn't that cold.
- Oh, it was freezing.

53:51.445 --> 53:52.925
There was a dust of snow
on the ground,

53:52.968 --> 53:55.188
- and everything was pink.
- I do remember that.

53:55.232 --> 53:56.885
- That was beautiful.
- Yeah.

53:56.929 --> 53:59.279
And you were shivering.
Yeah, trying to be so tough,

53:59.323 --> 54:01.542
but I saw you shivering.

54:01.586 --> 54:04.241
I told you
that I was moving to keep warm.

54:04.284 --> 54:05.807
Yeah, and that's when I said...

54:05.851 --> 54:08.767
"That's what shivering is,
Michael."

54:11.639 --> 54:14.251
I took a long look at you.

54:15.295 --> 54:17.166
And I thought,

54:17.210 --> 54:19.778
"All right, Book.

54:19.821 --> 54:21.910
What are you gonna do?"

54:30.049 --> 54:33.008
And that's when you said,

54:33.052 --> 54:36.142
"We're gonna be okay."

54:40.886 --> 54:42.931
Hmm.

54:48.067 --> 54:50.025
<i>Hard to believe it's over.</i>

54:50.069 --> 54:53.333
<i>The uncertainty,</i> <i>
the fear, the unknown.</i>

54:53.377 --> 54:55.727
<i>Sometimes it felt</i> <i>
like it would never end.</i>

54:55.770 --> 54:58.164
<i>But we made it.</i>

54:58.207 --> 54:59.905
<i>We've been tracking</i> <i>
subspace rifts.</i>

54:59.948 --> 55:02.690
<i>The Ten-C are keeping
their promise to clean them up.</i>

55:02.734 --> 55:04.518
<i>First contact wasn't easy,</i>

55:04.562 --> 55:07.608
<i>but, as always,</i> <i>
the effort was worth it.</i>

55:07.652 --> 55:09.001
How's it going?

55:09.044 --> 55:11.699
Uh, it's faster than expected, actually.

55:11.743 --> 55:14.485
<i>
Which means we'll all get</i> <i>
a much-needed break soon.</i>

55:14.528 --> 55:16.182
<i>Everyone has people to see...</i>

55:16.225 --> 55:18.271
- Is Bryce meeting us there?
- That's what he said.

55:18.315 --> 55:20.491
Ah, assuming Kovich lets him go.

55:20.534 --> 55:22.362
<i>...and places to visit.</i>

55:22.406 --> 55:25.452
<i>Places they haven't seen</i> <i>
in 930 years.</i>

55:25.496 --> 55:27.889
I can't believe
you did this for me.

55:27.933 --> 55:30.152
I actually get to go home.

55:30.196 --> 55:32.372
I did it for me, actually,

55:32.416 --> 55:35.288
so I can finally have mavi
not made by a replicator.

55:37.159 --> 55:39.031
<i>
Some will use this time</i>

55:39.074 --> 55:42.121
<i>to strengthen</i> <i>
existing relationships.</i>

55:45.080 --> 55:49.128
<i>Others are already reaching out</i> <i>
to build new ones.</i>

55:55.917 --> 55:57.354
<i>And Book.</i>

55:59.356 --> 56:02.359
<i>He's heading to</i> <i>
an emergency center on Europa.</i>

56:02.402 --> 56:04.404
<i>I don't know</i> <i>
when I'll see him again,</i>

56:04.448 --> 56:07.189
<i>but I know I will.</i>

56:07.233 --> 56:10.018
Kwakoni Yiquan.

56:10.062 --> 56:13.544
<i>We came to this future to find</i> <i>
the Federation in pieces.</i>

56:13.587 --> 56:17.852
<i>Quadrants and sectors,</i> <i>
planets and families divided.</i>

56:17.896 --> 56:20.420
<i>So much uncertainty</i> <i>
and disconnection.</i>

56:20.464 --> 56:23.249
<i>But the Burn and the DMA</i> <i>
have shown us</i>

56:23.292 --> 56:25.556
<i>that we are all connected,</i>

56:25.599 --> 56:27.819
<i>and we can overcome</i> <i>
any challenge</i>

56:27.862 --> 56:30.387
<i>so long as we do it together.</i>

56:30.430 --> 56:33.825
<i>The Federation is continuing
to help impacted worlds recover.</i>

56:33.868 --> 56:36.088
<i>Many have since joined us.</i>

56:36.131 --> 56:38.917
<i>Their perspectives are
helping us all see more clearly.</i>

56:38.960 --> 56:41.006
<i>Ni'Var is back.</i>

56:41.049 --> 56:43.138
<i>Tellar Prime never left.</i>

56:43.182 --> 56:45.924
<i>Andoria's now in talks.</i> <i>
And today,</i>

56:45.967 --> 56:50.015
<i>we greet the president</i> <i>
of United Earth.</i>

56:57.979 --> 57:00.112
- Madam President.
- Madam President.

57:00.155 --> 57:01.461
Welcome.

57:01.505 --> 57:03.289
I am so pleased
that you've come.

57:03.332 --> 57:05.726
We are eager to begin
diplomatic discussions.

57:05.770 --> 57:07.424
Nothing to discuss.

57:08.294 --> 57:10.296
United Earth is ready right now

57:10.339 --> 57:12.298
to rejoin the Federation.

57:12.341 --> 57:16.215
And nothing could make me
happier than to say those words.

57:16.258 --> 57:17.477
Thank you.

57:17.521 --> 57:18.783
Thank you all.

57:18.826 --> 57:21.481
What you
have accomplished here...

57:21.525 --> 57:24.223
We were lucky
to have each other, ma'am.

57:24.266 --> 57:27.269
We couldn't have succeeded otherwise. General.

57:27.313 --> 57:29.010
I'm glad to see
you've recovered.

57:29.054 --> 57:32.623
Yes. I haven't had that close
a call in quite a while.

57:32.666 --> 57:34.668
I would consider it
a personal favor

57:34.712 --> 57:37.192
if that were
your last close call.

57:37.236 --> 57:40.239
I'm ever at your service,
Madam President.

57:40.282 --> 57:42.502
Captain, may I have a word?

57:42.546 --> 57:43.547
Of course.

57:47.159 --> 57:49.814
I can only imagine
what you're feeling,

57:49.857 --> 57:51.380
having lived in a time

57:51.424 --> 57:53.861
before Earth
left the Federation.

57:53.905 --> 57:57.299
It means a lot to all of us.

57:57.343 --> 58:00.607
But, yes,
it's-it's very special to me

58:00.651 --> 58:02.566
to get to welcome you home.

58:02.609 --> 58:05.264
- Thank you.
- Bringing the Federation

58:05.307 --> 58:08.485
back together again
has been a great start.

58:08.528 --> 58:11.488
But there are countless worlds
out there to still be explored.

58:11.531 --> 58:14.012
So many are looking
for understanding,

58:14.055 --> 58:15.840
connection,

58:15.883 --> 58:18.146
better tomorrow.

58:18.190 --> 58:19.757
There's a lot of work to do.

58:19.800 --> 58:21.933
Are you ready for that?

58:21.976 --> 58:24.413
I am.

58:24.457 --> 58:26.415
Let's get to it.
