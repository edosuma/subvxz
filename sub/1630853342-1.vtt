15:19.396 --> 15:22.051
Thank you, sir. Glad to be here.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.619
-[communicator chirps]
-Enterpriseis cleared
for launch.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.752
Okay, Ortegas,
let's take her out.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.153
We are five-by-five for warp.

15:37.197 --> 15:39.286
[faint moaning]

15:48.251 --> 15:49.774
Captain?

15:49.818 --> 15:51.559
What?

15:53.300 --> 15:55.258
Oh.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.956
Right, of course.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.959
Okay, Ms. Ortegas.

16:01.482 --> 16:02.787
Hit it.

16:11.535 --> 16:12.972
Ship wide, Cadet Uhura.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.756
Aye, sir.

16:14.799 --> 16:17.150
This is your captain.

16:17.193 --> 16:18.890
We're a little early
out of the gates,

16:18.934 --> 16:20.283
so I hope we didn't
catch anybody

16:20.327 --> 16:21.415
with your hair wet
or your pants down.

16:23.373 --> 16:26.811
As you're all aware, Starfleet
sends out a first contact team

16:26.855 --> 16:28.770
whenever our deep space probes
detect signs

16:28.813 --> 16:30.859
of a working warp engine.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.427
Six days ago, the signature
of a functioning warp drive

16:33.470 --> 16:35.777
appeared on Kiley 279.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.345
The USSArcher
went to say hello.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.043
We have since lost contact.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.350
Our mission
is to find our people

16:43.393 --> 16:45.482
and bring them home.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.484
And maybe if we get lucky,

16:47.528 --> 16:49.312
make some new friends.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.227
Nobody dies.

16:51.271 --> 16:54.622
This mission will not
be anybody's last day.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.322
Captain out.

17:02.325 --> 17:05.024
Let me know when we get there.
I'll be in my quarters.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.590
Number One, you have the comm.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.767
Aye, Captain.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.856
Maintain course and speed.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.733
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Alert, radiation leak detected.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.387
Training exercise aborted.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.997
-WOMAN: I got this!
-MAN: Get out of here!

17:22.041 --> 17:24.086
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Four seconds to lockdown.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.175
-Three.
-[indistinct shouting]

17:26.219 --> 17:28.438
Aah!

17:28.482 --> 17:30.353
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Radiation reaching
critical levels.

17:30.397 --> 17:31.920
[indistinct shouting]

17:31.963 --> 17:34.140
-Lockdown complete.
-MAN: Captain Pike!

17:34.183 --> 17:37.143
-No!
-[overlapping shouting]

17:39.580 --> 17:41.495
[door chimes]

17:41.538 --> 17:43.584
Come.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.676
Mr. Spock.

17:48.719 --> 17:51.331
Captain, I do not wish
to overstep.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.943
Overstep.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.731
Saurian brandy?

18:02.429 --> 18:05.214
Are you... yourself, sir?

18:05.258 --> 18:07.912
Well, I'm very much myself.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.001
That's the problem.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.918
It was not lost on me
that when you went down

18:13.962 --> 18:16.791
to the Klingon moon of Boreth,
you returned a changed man.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.532
Boreth is notable
for two things:

18:18.575 --> 18:20.621
a monastery and a rare ore

18:20.664 --> 18:22.623
that can cause temporal
consciousness displacement.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.147
Both of which bear
the power of transformation.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.584
It wasn't the monastery.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.717
No. I assumed as much.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.632
You saw the future?

18:33.416 --> 18:35.723
I saw my own death, Spock.

18:35.766 --> 18:39.205
At least the death
of the man I am now.

18:39.248 --> 18:42.991
I know exactly how and when
my life ends.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.734
And I didn't just see it,
I felt it.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.692
Every agonizing second.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.568
Most humans...

18:54.611 --> 18:56.570
we like to think

18:56.613 --> 18:59.138
that right until
the very last instant...

19:00.313 --> 19:02.271
...somehow, some way,

19:02.315 --> 19:04.186
we'll cheat death.
[short chuckle]

19:04.230 --> 19:06.188
At least I did.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.059
Is it soon?

19:08.103 --> 19:10.192
Only you could
ask that question.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.454
No.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.282
It's almost a decade away.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.502
Is that soon?

19:15.545 --> 19:17.808
Suddenly that feels soon.

19:19.854 --> 19:22.204
I can't stop seeing it.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.815
Sir, I would suggest
knowledge of death

19:24.859 --> 19:26.687
is vital
for effective leadership.

19:26.730 --> 19:29.603
Knowledge is one thing, Spock,
but I experienced it.

19:31.039 --> 19:34.173
How will it live in me?

19:34.216 --> 19:36.392
Will it make me hesitant?

19:36.436 --> 19:39.134
Cautious? Not cautious enough?

19:40.614 --> 19:42.311
I'm already
second-guessing myself.

19:42.355 --> 19:45.140
And that's the last thing
a captain can afford.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.404
Suffering can be
transformed into insight.

19:48.448 --> 19:51.320
You must seek out the good
in knowing your own death.

19:51.364 --> 19:54.410
Use it to be the man
you most essentially are.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.978
And who's that, Spock?

19:57.021 --> 19:59.241
The captain.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.245
[speaker chimes]

20:03.289 --> 20:04.681
UHURA:
Captain Pike to the bridge.

20:04.725 --> 20:07.162
We're dropping out of warp.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.037
[moaning]

20:32.622 --> 20:34.189
Any sign of the Archer?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.930
Getting her transponder ping
on the night side.

20:35.973 --> 20:38.106
Take us around, Lieutenant.
Hail her. All frequencies.

20:38.149 --> 20:39.542
Trying.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.370
Nothing, sir.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.416
Any chance we're losing her
response in sub-space chatter?

20:43.459 --> 20:45.722
There is no sub-space chatter.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.768
It's dead quiet out there.

20:47.811 --> 20:48.812
We've got a visual, sir.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.727
On screen.

20:51.902 --> 20:53.556
MITCHELL:
All systems show in the green.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.558
Ship's perfectly intact, sir.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.212
-PIKE: Life signs, Mr. Spock?
-SPOCK: None.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.518
But neither am I detecting
any bodies.

20:58.561 --> 20:59.649
The ship is empty.

20:59.693 --> 21:00.781
Where's her crew?

21:00.824 --> 21:02.217
Fascinating.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.827
I'm all ears.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.134
It's a figure of speech.

21:07.831 --> 21:10.051
I am remotely accessing
the ship's manifest.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.140
Archercarried only Una
and two astrophysicists.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.707
LA'AN:
If she went to the surface,

21:13.750 --> 21:15.143
she'd have headed
for the warp signature.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.492
Can you locate it, Spock?

21:16.536 --> 21:18.189
I have it, sir. Although...

21:18.233 --> 21:20.061
Not really in the mood
for an "although" right now.

21:20.104 --> 21:22.411
I'm having trouble locking on.
Its location may be shielded.

21:22.455 --> 21:26.023
This warp signature's also got
a pretty weird signal variance.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.068
Pretty weird?

21:29.113 --> 21:31.115
Recommend deflector shields
to full.

21:31.159 --> 21:34.771
Any obviously defensive posture
is in direct violation

21:34.815 --> 21:36.382
of first contact protocols.

21:36.425 --> 21:38.514
No hails from the surface
or sub-space chatter.

21:38.558 --> 21:39.994
No interplanetary traffic.

21:40.037 --> 21:41.604
Not one orbital dock.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.389
-What's your point?
-These people aren't showing

21:43.432 --> 21:45.173
any signs
of local space colonization.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.001
Which puts them a century
behind constructing warp drive.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.872
Yet they have a warp signature.

21:48.916 --> 21:50.918
A nascent one.

21:50.961 --> 21:53.399
-The anomaly is a red flag.
-Captain, there is
not sufficient...

21:53.442 --> 21:55.575
-Activate deflector shields.
-Aye.

21:58.273 --> 22:01.102
ORTEGAS:
Reading multiple launches
from the surface.

22:06.107 --> 22:08.631
Plasma torpedoes.
Three direct hits.

22:08.675 --> 22:10.329
-Damage assessment?
-MITCHELL: Minimal.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.287
But if we hadn't had
our shields up...

22:13.288 --> 22:14.289
Good call, Number One.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.509
Take us up, Ortegas.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.033
Maybe they'll think they got us.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.861
What is going on down there?

22:20.904 --> 22:22.558
Plasma torpedoes?

22:22.602 --> 22:24.691
That's 21st-century tech.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.432
How in the hell
did these people develop

22:26.475 --> 22:28.042
a faster-than-light engine?

22:30.218 --> 22:31.872
They did not.

22:31.915 --> 22:33.743
Recommend we go to red alert.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.484
Red alert, Ms. Uhura.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.053
-[alarm blaring]
-I have analyzed
the signal variance

22:39.096 --> 22:40.620
Lieutenant Ortegas isolated.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.404
These people have not
built a warp drive.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.188
Based on these readings,

22:44.232 --> 22:46.495
they have built a warp bomb.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.762
It would seem there are
two warring factions.

22:52.806 --> 22:55.374
And their conflict has escalated
to a crisis point.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.288
Surface scans of the planet

22:57.332 --> 22:59.421
are consistent
with pre-warp society.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.944
-How is that possible?
-SPOCK: As you know,

23:00.988 --> 23:02.816
the Vulcans
invented first contact.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.079
As they never fail to remind us.

23:05.122 --> 23:07.560
The worlds in this sector
with warp.

23:07.603 --> 23:09.866
All have or are in process

23:09.910 --> 23:11.868
of being inducted
into the Federation.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.696
We are free
to travel to any of them.

23:13.740 --> 23:15.437
General Order 1 does not apply.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.787
Not on one of these worlds--

23:17.831 --> 23:20.747
in fact, not once in the entire
history of first contact

23:20.790 --> 23:23.010
has warp been first developed
as anything but a drive.

23:23.053 --> 23:25.316
Put another way,
the nuclear bomb

23:25.360 --> 23:27.406
could have been invented
before particle physics.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.233
-It simply never has been.
-Would Number One have known

23:29.277 --> 23:31.148
that the warp signature
was that of a weapon?

23:31.192 --> 23:34.282
Possibly not. Our scanners
were just updated in space dock.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.066
LA'AN:
If those missiles are
the best they've got,

23:36.110 --> 23:38.460
let's beam down, find
our people, and bring them home.

23:38.504 --> 23:39.809
We have to consider
the possibility

23:39.853 --> 23:41.376
that this technology
isn't native.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.247
However they got it,

23:43.291 --> 23:45.075
if they found it
in a crashed alien

23:45.119 --> 23:47.556
spacecraft, if it was placed
in their hands...

23:47.600 --> 23:49.776
-General Order 1 applies.
-We cannot interfere

23:49.819 --> 23:52.082
with their natural development.
We cannot show ourselves

23:52.126 --> 23:53.736
-for risk...
-But if they've already seen us?

23:53.780 --> 23:55.085
We cannot risk the possibility.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.783
So we just leave
our people there?

23:56.826 --> 23:58.698
Hardly.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.790
Let's go see the doctor.

24:06.575 --> 24:10.405
Doc.
Please, dispense some wisdom.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.624
Okay.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.582
Never get the house dressing.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.497
[laughs]

24:15.541 --> 24:17.020
Ah.

24:17.064 --> 24:18.892
Good to see you.

24:18.935 --> 24:21.068
Dr. M'Benga toured
the Mojave with me

24:21.111 --> 24:24.288
-and I toured Kenya with him.
-Mr. Spock.

24:24.332 --> 24:27.335
-And this is...
-A pleasure to see you again.

24:27.378 --> 24:29.990
Of course.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.731
You had to certify her for duty.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.689
I received your orders, Captain.

24:33.733 --> 24:35.735
This is Nurse Chapel.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.824
Nurse Chapel
is on civilian exchange

24:37.867 --> 24:39.739
from the Stanford Morehouse
Epigenetic Project.

24:39.782 --> 24:42.132
Sounds like you're
just the person for the job.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.525
What job?

24:43.569 --> 24:45.745
I'm gonna mess with your genome.

24:45.788 --> 24:47.834
You first.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.314
The locals are humanoid.

24:50.358 --> 24:51.881
They're a close match
to most of the crews'

24:51.925 --> 24:53.274
physiology and genetics.

24:53.317 --> 24:54.797
But we'll need to make

24:54.841 --> 24:56.059
a few alterations
if you want to blend in.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.887
Internally, they have a bunch

24:57.931 --> 24:59.149
of different organs that would

24:59.193 --> 25:00.629
take a lot longer
to change, so...

25:00.673 --> 25:02.936
just try not to get an X-ray.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.459
Change how, exactly?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.722
Nurse Chapel is part
of Starfleet's initiative

25:06.766 --> 25:10.639
to better observe alien cultures
without contamination.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.685
You make disguises.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.513
And you boss a rocket ship,

25:14.556 --> 25:17.037
if, you know, we're going
all simplistic here.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.692
I make minor alterations

25:19.735 --> 25:21.563
to your genetic code

25:21.607 --> 25:23.826
and induce internal celerity
to express

25:23.870 --> 25:25.828
short-term changes
to your biology.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.221
Is it safe?

25:27.264 --> 25:29.397
Almost every time.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.486
Sedative first.

25:33.270 --> 25:35.838
Your body is going
to undergo compressed,

25:35.882 --> 25:38.449
jury-rigged metamorphosis.

25:38.493 --> 25:40.669
It's... painful.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.889
Damn the ramparts, Doctor.

25:44.194 --> 25:45.718
It means go ahead.

25:46.719 --> 25:48.764
[chuckles]: Okay.

25:53.029 --> 25:55.336
CHAPEL:
I modified it for you.
