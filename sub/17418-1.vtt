00:13.500 --> 00:15.140
Urgent call for the Duty Inspector.

00:19.261 --> 00:20.620
DI Denton.

00:20.621 --> 00:23.381
DS Jayne Akers, calling with
request for urgent assistance,

00:23.382 --> 00:25.222
immediate
and credible threat to life.

00:27.983 --> 00:29.622
We need Gold to sign off.

00:29.623 --> 00:31.143
Chief Super's gone home.

00:31.144 --> 00:32.424
Well then, call him at home.

00:36.025 --> 00:37.944
'This is
Chief Superintendent Mallick...

00:37.945 --> 00:40.706
'please leave your name and number
and I will get back to you.'

00:42.306 --> 00:44.226
He's not picking up his mobile
either.

00:44.227 --> 00:46.747
We really ought to give him another
five minutes.

00:47.907 --> 00:49.228
Ma'am...

00:50.428 --> 00:51.668
There she goes...

00:57.590 --> 00:59.269
'Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.'

00:59.270 --> 01:01.349
Sir, this is DI Lindsay Denton.

01:01.350 --> 01:02.870
Yes, Linda, how can I help you?

01:02.871 --> 01:04.870
'Sir, I need Gold approval
for an op.'

01:08.232 --> 01:09.871
We allowed to know where
we're going?

01:09.872 --> 01:13.152
Suspect in a missing persons enquiry,
need to get him in for questioning.

01:13.153 --> 01:16.033
No, my car! What? Just... come on!

01:16.034 --> 01:18.074
Come on!

01:43.360 --> 01:46.241
DS Akers.
Thanks for stepping in, ma'am.

01:49.041 --> 01:51.481
I need a safe
and available destination ASAP.

01:51.482 --> 01:53.321
Straight into town?

01:53.322 --> 01:54.882
I'd take the back roads.

01:59.443 --> 02:02.323
You lead. Have your men in my car,
engine running, ready to go.

02:02.324 --> 02:04.564
Yeah, I'm going to take
the rest of your team...

02:04.565 --> 02:06.484
It's just me. What?

02:06.485 --> 02:07.605
Ma'am...

02:08.686 --> 02:10.006
..please.

02:11.806 --> 02:12.966
OK.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.606
Keep the radio
in the car on channel 1.

02:14.607 --> 02:17.006
Personal radios back-to-back on 2.

02:17.007 --> 02:19.407
Who's in the house?
I don't know.

02:19.408 --> 02:20.808
Just move. Please.

02:54.016 --> 02:56.336
Wallis to Denton, it's
straight on here, ma'am.

02:59.217 --> 03:01.337
Yeah.
I know the way to my own station.

03:19.221 --> 03:21.022
No!

03:41.866 --> 03:45.626
Charlie Mike two-five, status zero,
status zero, Long Lane
and Crown Avenue!

03:45.627 --> 03:48.147
Charlie Mike two-five,
confirm message.

03:48.148 --> 03:49.868
Status zero, status zero!

05:03.245 --> 05:04.485
How are you, Lindsay?

05:06.165 --> 05:07.806
Anything I can get you?

05:09.206 --> 05:10.886
No, thanks.

05:14.567 --> 05:16.768
Up to answering
a couple of questions?

05:19.088 --> 05:22.689
I'm just trying to get my head
around what happened out there, sir.

05:24.249 --> 05:27.809
But no-one seems to know what
you were up to...

05:27.810 --> 05:29.010
I'm not sure I do, either.

05:30.091 --> 05:31.891
Wallis and Butler are dead.

05:33.171 --> 05:34.571
The other two...

05:34.572 --> 05:36.411
Get the next shot ready.

05:36.412 --> 05:38.133
..they're still trying to save.

05:40.533 --> 05:42.172
Who are they?

05:42.173 --> 05:46.014
I'm not clear yet on whether that's
something I should be divulging,
sir.

05:50.055 --> 05:51.215
It'd help to know!

05:55.816 --> 05:57.696
I got your messages.

05:57.697 --> 05:58.936
Instead of dropping me in it,

05:58.937 --> 06:00.857
if you'd given me
a minute to get back to you.

06:00.858 --> 06:03.457
I gave you more than a minute.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.939
I gave you 20.

06:35.185 --> 06:36.905
Two more breaths, please.

06:36.906 --> 06:38.826
No... I'm calling it, asystolic.

06:41.747 --> 06:43.866
Pulse-less for 20 minutes.

06:43.867 --> 06:45.947
Everyone OK with that?

06:45.948 --> 06:48.108
OK, CPR discontinued at 23.12.

07:06.712 --> 07:08.353
Everybody!

07:09.593 --> 07:11.713
Evidence recovery's ongoing,
so, guys,

07:11.714 --> 07:14.594
please respect the limits
of the cordon at all times.

07:18.155 --> 07:20.795
Our forensic scene investigators
have work lights.

07:20.796 --> 07:22.955
Talk to me
if you need any lighting changes

07:22.956 --> 07:24.636
This way, sir.

07:48.482 --> 07:51.001
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.

07:51.002 --> 07:53.682
There's been
an attack on the police.

07:53.683 --> 07:58.003
Three of our colleagues have lost
their lives in the line of duty.

07:58.004 --> 08:01.684
Our first thoughts are with
their families.

08:01.685 --> 08:04.564
But now the hunt begins
for the people who committed

08:04.565 --> 08:05.926
this brutal crime.

08:34.692 --> 08:36.291
This way.

08:36.292 --> 08:38.212
'Doors closing.'

08:48.535 --> 08:50.416
Sir. As you were.

09:06.139 --> 09:08.659
The transit convoy was ambushed.

09:08.660 --> 09:11.859
The two 4th Street officers
were shot dead.

09:11.860 --> 09:14.380
The vehicle was set alight,
and the witness

09:14.381 --> 09:16.981
and the handler suffered critical
burns and gunshot wounds.

09:16.982 --> 09:19.582
The handler was pronounced
dead on arrival at the hospital.

09:20.582 --> 09:24.422
We've been assigned to investigate
the possibility that

09:24.423 --> 09:27.383
a police officer or officers tipped
somebody off.

09:27.384 --> 09:29.223
Who is he?

09:29.224 --> 09:32.024
Classified.
He was under Witness Protection.

09:32.025 --> 09:35.145
New identity, relocation, the WORKS.

09:35.146 --> 09:37.225
And how is he, sir, the witness?

09:37.226 --> 09:38.706
Critical but stable.

09:40.827 --> 09:42.866
Can I ask you a question?

09:42.867 --> 09:44.068
Depends on the question.

09:46.028 --> 09:48.668
"Critical but stable" -
what does that mean exactly?

09:48.669 --> 09:50.788
Well, he's been lucky.
His chances are good.

09:50.789 --> 09:52.149
He doesn't look very lucky.

09:53.390 --> 09:54.750
I'll set up an alert.

09:55.910 --> 09:59.110
As soon as he comes round,
we'll be banging on his door.

09:59.111 --> 10:00.751
Thank you. Sir.

10:02.032 --> 10:05.031
He said it was a convoy.
Who was in the other vehicles?

10:05.032 --> 10:08.432
Just one vehicle, driven by our only
other survivor, DI Lindsay Denton.

10:08.433 --> 10:10.473
When can we talk to her?

10:10.474 --> 10:12.233
I'm chasing.
But she's in counselling.

10:12.234 --> 10:14.794
Are we allowed to know
the names of the deceased officers?

10:14.795 --> 10:20.115
From 4th Street Station - Sergeant
Alex Wallis, PC Vincent Butler,

10:20.116 --> 10:23.275
and... the third victim's name is
being withheld from the public

10:23.276 --> 10:27.197
because she was from
Witness Protection - DS Jayne Akers.

10:30.558 --> 10:32.398
Sorry, sir, I'll be down in five.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.759
Sure.

10:53.963 --> 10:55.204
You got a minute, sir?

10:56.604 --> 10:58.044
See you back at the office.

10:59.245 --> 11:01.085
This one's not for me, sir.

11:03.285 --> 11:05.445
This is going to be a very
high-profile case.

11:05.446 --> 11:06.965
I need my best team.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.846
I'm flattered, sir,
but I knew Jayne Akers.

11:08.847 --> 11:10.286
We went through Ryton together.

11:10.287 --> 11:13.887
Half the job went through
training together,
and we're not investigating Akers.

11:13.888 --> 11:15.447
Not yet.

11:15.448 --> 11:17.448
There's three of our own
in the morgue!

11:17.449 --> 11:19.448
Am I meant to be angry,
is that it, sir?

11:19.449 --> 11:21.409
Well, you ought to be.

11:21.410 --> 11:23.569
And if I find out a police
officer's responsible,

11:23.570 --> 11:25.329
even in the slightest,
I'll be livid!

11:25.330 --> 11:27.050
I'm not. That's the problem.

11:27.051 --> 11:28.210
Problem?

11:28.211 --> 11:31.892
I'd rather not investigate
the death of a former colleague.
I like keeping a distance.

11:33.172 --> 11:34.491
What about Steve?

11:34.492 --> 11:36.412
Well, I'll have to find him
a new partner

11:36.413 --> 11:38.053
and I expect he won't like it.

11:39.894 --> 11:41.134
Away you go.

11:57.658 --> 11:59.417
Sorry to keep you.

11:59.418 --> 12:01.217
No problem, sir.

12:01.218 --> 12:05.178
DC Georgina Trotman,
meet DS Steven Arnott.

12:05.179 --> 12:06.859
Steve, meet your new partner.

12:06.860 --> 12:09.179
Actually, sir, it's Georgia.

12:09.180 --> 12:10.980
Georgia. Sorry.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.860
Pleased to meet you. Likewise.

12:12.861 --> 12:15.861
I've just been given
the operational parameters.

12:15.862 --> 12:17.861
Witness Protection is off limits.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.542
For Christ's sake.

12:19.543 --> 12:23.262
Yeah. Major Violent Crime are going
after the gunmen.

12:23.263 --> 12:27.783
So, AC-12's brief is to investigate
the suspicion that

12:27.784 --> 12:31.184
information leakage
by a police officer

12:31.185 --> 12:33.425
is part of the set-up
of the ambush.

12:33.426 --> 12:36.425
Sir... Steve. I get it. I get it.

12:36.426 --> 12:39.066
This is how Dryden wants it.
We get the 4th Street officers.

12:39.067 --> 12:40.746
Only one's still alive.

12:40.747 --> 12:42.587
So, you go after Denton.

12:42.588 --> 12:44.027
Very good, sir.

12:44.028 --> 12:45.308
Thank you, you two.

12:54.350 --> 12:56.230
Is she up to it?

12:56.231 --> 12:58.911
Get you, the Big I Am.

13:01.072 --> 13:02.951
Yes, I think so.

13:02.952 --> 13:04.352
This investigation, sir...

13:04.353 --> 13:06.273
Aye, aye. That's the spirit.

13:12.434 --> 13:13.915
Welcome to AC-12.

13:46.762 --> 13:48.122
Morning, ma'am.

14:12.128 --> 14:14.847
How you faring, ma'am?

14:14.848 --> 14:16.008
OK. Thanks.

14:16.009 --> 14:18.809
Anythin' I can do, don't hesitate.
Cheers, sarge.

14:22.650 --> 14:24.291
Welcome back, Lindsay.

14:26.371 --> 14:28.731
Sir.

14:28.732 --> 14:31.692
You've been through a lot.
Just take it steady.

14:33.773 --> 14:34.973
Thanks.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.184
This one's taken.

15:29.185 --> 15:30.705
I said, "This one's taken."

15:43.588 --> 15:45.429
No firearms! No backup!

15:46.549 --> 15:49.510
It should be you we're burying,
you stupid bitch!

16:26.038 --> 16:27.518
DI Royal. DI Denton.

17:17.969 --> 17:22.930
AC-12 interview - DI Lindsay Denton
and Federation rep DI Samuel Royal,

17:22.931 --> 17:27.412
in the presence of Superintendent
Hastings, DS Arnott, DC Trotman.

17:28.972 --> 17:31.532
DI Denton, thank
you very much for coming in today.

17:31.533 --> 17:34.692
Let's be clear, you're being
interviewed today as a witness,

17:34.693 --> 17:39.533
not as a suspect in any matters
of crime, discipline or misconduct.

17:39.534 --> 17:41.294
Whatever I can do to help, sir.

17:41.295 --> 17:42.734
Thank you.

17:42.735 --> 17:45.055
So, how did you come to be
involved in the operation

17:45.056 --> 17:48.375
that took place on the night
of September 5th?

17:48.376 --> 17:51.456
Just bad luck.
I was on the ghost rota.

17:51.457 --> 17:53.616
The Duty Sergeant took a call
and passed it on to me.

17:53.617 --> 17:56.458
And what was said in that call?

17:57.858 --> 18:02.419
The caller identified
herself as DS Akers. DS Jayne Akers.

18:03.980 --> 18:07.220
Akers or the individual identifying
herself as Akers advised me

18:07.221 --> 18:10.821
that there was an immediate
and credible threat to the
life of a protected witness.

18:12.142 --> 18:14.861
Did she expand on the nature
of that threat?

18:14.862 --> 18:16.462
No, she did not.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.582
Did she give any indication as to
where the information came from?

18:19.583 --> 18:20.704
No, she did not.

18:22.824 --> 18:24.623
Go on.

18:24.624 --> 18:27.024
DS Akers requested assistance.

18:27.025 --> 18:28.864
You were the duty station?

18:28.865 --> 18:31.225
DI Denton is entitled to be
questioned by an officer

18:31.226 --> 18:33.585
at least one rank superior.

18:33.586 --> 18:35.546
There's no suspicion of DI Denton.

18:35.547 --> 18:39.108
She is being interviewed purely as a
witness. Yeah... Sam, it's all fine.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.708
We were the duty station as, at that
time, Akers and the witness were

18:43.709 --> 18:46.668
located within the precinct of 4th
Street and the 4th Street Estate.

18:46.669 --> 18:48.469
And did you share that
information with

18:48.470 --> 18:51.189
the officers
at 4th Street Station?

18:51.190 --> 18:52.630
No, I did not, sir.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.350
You did not?

18:54.351 --> 18:55.710
Why not?

18:55.711 --> 18:58.991
DS Akers impressed on me the secure
nature of our communication,

18:58.992 --> 19:00.752
and that I should only
involve others

19:00.753 --> 19:02.752
when strictly operationally
necessary.

19:02.753 --> 19:05.473
I... I invented a cover story
involving

19:05.474 --> 19:07.673
the arrest of
a missing person suspect.

19:07.674 --> 19:09.754
You shared the information
with no-one?

19:09.755 --> 19:13.114
I discussed the matter with
Deputy Chief Constable Dryden.

19:13.115 --> 19:15.916
I sought his approval
to render assistance.

19:17.356 --> 19:21.796
Didn't DS Akers advise you to
inform as few people as possible?

19:21.797 --> 19:25.517
A critical incident response of that
type requires Gold approval, sir.

19:25.518 --> 19:26.718
Quite right.

19:27.919 --> 19:30.078
You always adhere to regulations?

19:30.079 --> 19:31.518
That's what they're there for.

19:31.519 --> 19:35.359
I can see you and I are going to get
on like a house on fire, DI Denton!

19:35.360 --> 19:38.760
So, Deputy Chief Constable Dryden,

19:38.761 --> 19:41.441
what induced you to call him
in particular?

19:41.442 --> 19:44.681
An incident occurred a few months
ago in which the Duty CS

19:44.682 --> 19:48.482
failed to answer. DCC Dryden made it
clear that he could be

19:48.483 --> 19:50.643
contacted in such circumstances.

19:50.644 --> 19:53.283
I... I think it was his way
of finding out which brass were

19:53.284 --> 19:55.325
pulling their weight
and which weren't.

19:56.805 --> 19:59.805
And why did you assign Wallis
and Butler?

19:59.806 --> 20:02.326
They were two officers
I knew by reputation.

20:03.607 --> 20:05.006
They could handle themselves.

20:05.007 --> 20:06.327
Two unarmed officers.

20:10.528 --> 20:11.768
No firearms?

20:12.809 --> 20:13.969
No backup?

20:15.049 --> 20:18.770
If there was anything I could do to
reverse that decision, sir...

20:20.770 --> 20:24.570
DI Denton's statement records
she was acting on

20:24.571 --> 20:26.371
DS Akers' instructions.

20:26.372 --> 20:29.691
Nobody's blaming you, I mean
if those were Akers' instructions.

20:29.692 --> 20:32.652
I just thought you might think
they were...

20:32.653 --> 20:33.853
a bit irregular?

20:38.775 --> 20:42.574
You took the view it was
Akers' area of specialisation?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.736
Exactly.

20:49.777 --> 20:53.178
The ambush, ma'am,
must've been frightening.

20:54.898 --> 20:57.298
It was.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.858
You ever experienced
anything like that before?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.619
No. Thankfully.

21:01.620 --> 21:03.979
That's true, isn't it, DI Denton?

21:03.980 --> 21:05.740
You've held down a lot of desk jobs?

21:05.741 --> 21:07.380
You're a bit of a...

21:07.381 --> 21:09.500
backroom detective?

21:09.501 --> 21:12.181
I believe I've done important work,
sir.

21:12.182 --> 21:13.542
Absolutely.

21:14.623 --> 21:16.182
Absolutely.

21:16.183 --> 21:18.222
You did well in a very testing
situation, ma'am.

21:18.223 --> 21:19.943
Thank you.

21:19.944 --> 21:22.903
You've never faced an anti-corruption
hearing, have you, ma'am?

21:22.904 --> 21:23.944
No.

21:23.945 --> 21:27.945
In 2002, DC Denton alleged
a colleague was falsifying

21:27.946 --> 21:29.505
witness statements.

21:29.506 --> 21:32.586
The complaint was upheld -
the officer was disciplined.

21:32.587 --> 21:35.946
In 2007, DS Denton alleged
a colleague was making

21:35.947 --> 21:37.627
fraudulent expenses' claims.

21:37.628 --> 21:40.068
The complaint was upheld -
the officer was disciplined.

21:41.148 --> 21:43.828
DI Denton has demonstrated
the utmost probity throughout

21:43.829 --> 21:45.189
her service career.

21:46.550 --> 21:50.550
It takes courage to make a moral
stand against your fellow officers,

21:50.551 --> 21:53.110
except sometimes
they don't see it that way.

21:53.111 --> 21:54.151
No.

21:55.312 --> 21:57.671
I direct you to
document seven in your folder.

21:57.672 --> 22:01.352
Document seven, for the tape,
is a map showing

22:01.353 --> 22:05.793
the location of the safe house,
the ambush and 4th Street Station.

22:05.794 --> 22:09.114
For the tape, I'm indicating
the route taken that night.

22:09.115 --> 22:11.794
Two unmarked police vehicles
departed the safe house.

22:11.795 --> 22:15.075
And the most direct route to 4th
Street Station is via A roads.

22:15.076 --> 22:18.396
Instead, the vehicles travelled
along Crown Avenue and then
turned left

22:18.397 --> 22:22.278
into Long Lane, almost immediately
after which the ambush took place.

22:23.958 --> 22:25.677
Agreed and accepted?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.478
Agreed and accepted.

22:27.479 --> 22:30.960
A decision was taken not to go
the fastest way, via A roads.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.399
That's correct.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.280
DI Denton was following
DS Akers' instructions.

22:36.281 --> 22:37.841
Akers' chose the route?

22:39.402 --> 22:40.441
Yeah.

22:40.442 --> 22:43.722
This back route, it would
lead to 4th Street Station,

22:43.723 --> 22:46.122
but only if you'd
continued along Crown Avenue.

22:46.123 --> 22:48.124
The vehicles turned
left into Long Lane.

22:50.124 --> 22:51.164
Yeah.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.605
You didn't question that decision?

22:56.285 --> 22:58.085
No, sir.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.526
You had a radio, didn't you?

23:00.966 --> 23:02.006
Yeah.

23:02.007 --> 23:04.006
So, why didn't you question
the decision?

23:04.007 --> 23:06.527
Can we take a step back, please,

23:06.528 --> 23:10.728
and remind ourselves that DI Denton
is being interviewed as a witness?

23:10.729 --> 23:12.809
Absolutely, absolutely.

23:15.530 --> 23:19.209
The decision appeared to make
sense at the time.

23:19.210 --> 23:22.010
There were roadworks
on Crown Avenue,

23:22.011 --> 23:27.571
erm, with temporary traffic signals
controlling a single lane.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.652
It was a potential hold-up
that would've left us vulnerable.

23:30.653 --> 23:33.493
There were no roadworks
on Crown Avenue that night.

23:33.494 --> 23:36.213
Works had been completed
the day before.

23:36.214 --> 23:37.894
I wasn't aware.

23:37.895 --> 23:42.255
You didn't make a point of getting
up-to-date travel information?

23:42.256 --> 23:44.335
No.
You said Akers chose the route,

23:44.336 --> 23:47.616
but you seem very familiar
with the arguments.

23:47.617 --> 23:49.577
You were the ranking officer.

23:50.978 --> 23:53.618
You and Akers discussed
the route between you.

23:54.778 --> 23:56.259
That's more likely, isn't it?

23:59.740 --> 24:00.900
Not more likely?

24:02.340 --> 24:03.820
I think we should stop there.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.262
Are you withdrawing
your cooperation, DI Denton?

24:14.063 --> 24:15.262
DI Denton?

24:15.263 --> 24:16.623
No, of course I cooperate.

24:17.744 --> 24:20.343
Your vehicle was the only one
that wasn't shot at.

24:20.344 --> 24:23.144
They didn't need to.
They'd knocked my car off the road.

24:23.145 --> 24:24.505
I, erm...

24:25.865 --> 24:29.625
..I took cover inside
until they fled the scene.

24:29.626 --> 24:31.666
You were in fear of your life.

24:31.667 --> 24:33.386
Understandably.

24:33.387 --> 24:35.227
According to the
pathologist's report,

24:35.228 --> 24:38.627
Wallis and Butler died almost
instantly from gunshot wounds.

24:38.628 --> 24:40.908
But Akers
and her witness were alive.

24:40.909 --> 24:42.189
The witness...

24:43.669 --> 24:45.069
..managed to put out the flames,

24:45.070 --> 24:46.310
but...

24:47.350 --> 24:50.750
Akers, she couldn't...

24:50.751 --> 24:52.830
I, er...

24:52.831 --> 24:54.512
I threw my coat over her.

24:55.672 --> 24:56.872
Well done, ma'am.

24:58.833 --> 25:01.552
Did you help get them
out of the car?

25:01.553 --> 25:03.073
No.

25:03.074 --> 25:04.714
No?

25:07.675 --> 25:10.195
They came out themselves, sir.
They, er...

25:13.036 --> 25:15.237
..they, er,
they were already burning.

25:19.878 --> 25:22.758
I'm sorry.
That must've been a horrible sight.

25:23.878 --> 25:25.239
It was.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.359
We all appreciate
that you've been...

25:32.360 --> 25:34.520
through the most terrible situation,

25:34.521 --> 25:36.481
but we have a job to do.

25:38.202 --> 25:40.321
What we're trying to get at here,
DI Denton,

25:40.322 --> 25:43.363
is how those gunmen knew where
you were that night.

25:45.163 --> 25:46.443
I wish I could help you, sir.

25:46.444 --> 25:49.723
You do understand what we're
investigating here, don't you,
DI Denton?

25:49.724 --> 25:52.124
The possibility
of information leakage.

25:52.125 --> 25:54.044
Yeah, I understand.

25:54.045 --> 25:56.285
And information leakage can only
happen in two ways -

25:56.286 --> 25:57.605
deliberately...

25:57.606 --> 25:59.846
Officer corruption -
they're in with the criminals.

25:59.847 --> 26:01.286
..or accidentally...

26:01.287 --> 26:03.886
Officer incompetence -
they fail to communicate securely.

26:03.887 --> 26:05.767
This interview has to stop.

26:05.768 --> 26:07.767
If DI Denton is under suspicion,

26:07.768 --> 26:10.728
you need to issue her with
a Regulation 15 Notice.

26:10.729 --> 26:12.448
This is still information gathering.

26:12.449 --> 26:14.689
We are a long way from a Reg 15.

26:14.690 --> 26:17.489
Under AC-12's blanket authority
to vet any officer connected to

26:17.490 --> 26:21.450
an ongoing investigation, we carried
out financial checks on DI Denton.

26:21.451 --> 26:23.572
I've requested that you stop.

26:25.812 --> 26:29.012
Our strongest suspicion is that
criminal interests tried to

26:29.013 --> 26:32.293
assassinate the witness to stop him
from testifying.

26:32.294 --> 26:35.974
Now, those criminal interests
would pay a pretty penny

26:35.975 --> 26:38.974
for an inside man, or woman.

26:38.975 --> 26:42.135
And any officer in the financial
difficulties that you are in,

26:42.136 --> 26:45.256
DI Denton,
is duty-bound to declare it

26:45.257 --> 26:48.616
on the grounds that she would be
vulnerable to bribery.

26:48.617 --> 26:50.257
You're in debt up to your eyeballs.

26:50.258 --> 26:52.338
Stop the tape. We're finished here.

27:01.380 --> 27:04.221
My mother had to
go into a nursing home.

27:05.701 --> 27:10.341
And the council wouldn't pay, so we
sold her house but it wasn't enough.

27:10.342 --> 27:15.023
So, we sold mine,
but there was negative equity, so...

27:17.264 --> 27:19.823
..my mum is being looked after,
but I'm stuck with

27:19.824 --> 27:22.905
mortgage payments on a horrible
little place that I hate and...

27:24.225 --> 27:26.465
..you people... Lindsay, don't.

27:26.466 --> 27:28.265
..you people, you sit there
and you try

27:28.266 --> 27:30.507
and twist some case
out of my misfortunes.

27:32.107 --> 27:36.548
All I did was do my job.
That's all I've ever done.

27:39.509 --> 27:42.469
I shouldn't have even
been on duty that night.

27:42.470 --> 27:45.109
I'd do anything not to have been
there, not to have picked up

27:45.110 --> 27:47.510
that call, because for all
I know it's going to take away

27:47.511 --> 27:50.391
the one good thing in my life -
and that is being a police officer.

27:56.473 --> 27:58.392
That how it works here?

27:58.393 --> 28:00.112
Sometimes.

28:00.113 --> 28:03.033
You should've told me you were going
to treat her like a suspect.

28:03.034 --> 28:04.834
We weren't. She did that herself.

28:04.835 --> 28:06.354
She was defenceless in there.

28:06.355 --> 28:08.474
That's her rep's job, not ours.

28:08.475 --> 28:09.836
What's ours, then?

28:11.036 --> 28:12.915
Catching criminals.

28:12.916 --> 28:15.156
The criminals we
catch happen to be police officers.

28:15.157 --> 28:17.196
That's all there is to it.

28:17.197 --> 28:18.758
You think she's a criminal?

28:21.078 --> 28:22.998
Well?

28:22.999 --> 28:24.638
No.

28:24.639 --> 28:26.919
So, what gives you the right to
treat her like one?

28:26.920 --> 28:29.279
I've been through it.
That gives me the right.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.481
And having been through it,
it doesn't bother you?

28:33.641 --> 28:36.202
If this is not for you,
all you need to do is say.

28:39.562 --> 28:40.723
It's for me.

29:00.887 --> 29:03.687
Sergeant Alex Wallis
and Constable Vince Butler

29:03.688 --> 29:08.448
both leave behind them
families devastated by their loss.

29:08.449 --> 29:10.248
Who were the other casualties?

29:10.249 --> 29:14.409
A police detective was pronounced
dead shortly afterwards.

29:14.410 --> 29:16.850
A second police detective
suffered minor injuries.

29:16.851 --> 29:19.611
We're withholding both their names
for operational reasons.

29:21.852 --> 29:25.412
Can you confirm reports that there
was another casualty? A civilian?

29:25.413 --> 29:27.212
No.

29:27.213 --> 29:29.092
"There's been
an attack on the police."

29:29.093 --> 29:31.334
Those were my words
on the night of the ambush.

29:33.654 --> 29:37.455
For the families that lost
their loved ones, the hurt goes on.

29:38.456 --> 29:42.695
For those of us
charged with finding their killers,

29:42.696 --> 29:46.656
we must set that pain aside
and proceed with clear minds.

29:46.657 --> 29:50.738
And it's clear to me there's another
attack on the police...

29:51.899 --> 29:55.899
..an insidious and, ultimately,
more devastating one.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.499
Our numbers have been cut back.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.901
Public safety has been jeopardised.

30:03.221 --> 30:07.021
There's no clearer indicator than
the fact that on that night

30:07.022 --> 30:09.703
we weren't even able to
protect ourselves.

30:53.512 --> 30:55.233
God asks us to forgive.

30:58.313 --> 31:01.073
But first we must gain justice

31:01.074 --> 31:02.874
for our fallen comrades.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.595
"Dearly beloved,

31:07.596 --> 31:09.436
"avenge not yourselves...

31:11.997 --> 31:15.156
"..but rather give place unto wrath.

31:15.157 --> 31:17.837
"For it is written,

31:17.838 --> 31:19.357
" 'Vengeance is mine.

31:19.358 --> 31:21.638
" 'I will repay, '

31:21.639 --> 31:23.159
"saith the Lord."

31:26.240 --> 31:29.760
Detective Sergeant Jayne Akers
leaves a loving husband,

31:29.761 --> 31:31.640
Richard Akers,

31:31.641 --> 31:35.241
and many colleagues
devastated by her loss.

31:35.242 --> 31:37.241
The families of Sergeant Alex Wallis

31:37.242 --> 31:40.323
and Constable Vincent Butler
will miss them terribly...

31:42.083 --> 31:44.083
Sir.

31:44.084 --> 31:46.363
You called me that night.

31:46.364 --> 31:49.125
Yes, sir. How are you bearing up?

31:51.685 --> 31:53.246
OK, thanks, sir.

31:58.967 --> 32:01.047
Very sorry for your loss.

32:01.048 --> 32:03.288
Very sorry for your loss.
Thanks.

32:08.489 --> 32:10.130
Very sorry for your loss.

32:12.250 --> 32:13.970
Sorry. Sorry.

32:19.972 --> 32:24.412
Hi, it's me. Look, I've got to
work late tonight, I'm sorry.

32:24.413 --> 32:27.572
Yeah, would you mind getting
his stuff ready for school?

32:27.573 --> 32:31.454
Thanks, babe. Yeah, all right, then,
I'll speak to you in a bit, bye.

34:12.597 --> 34:15.197
I'm sorry. What for?

34:17.638 --> 34:21.279
For tonight. It doesn't matter much,
in the scheme of things.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.360
You two always used to end up
side by side.

34:40.203 --> 34:41.844
Do you think she ever knew?

34:45.043 --> 34:48.284
When it mattered, she trusted us
both with her life.

34:53.166 --> 34:55.367
The night of the ambush,
she called me, to call you.

34:57.047 --> 34:58.646
To say what?

34:58.647 --> 35:01.448
For you to call her back about
the case she was working on.

35:03.248 --> 35:07.208
Why didn't she call me direct? Was
she worried her phone was tapped?

35:07.209 --> 35:09.890
If you'd answered, you could've
asked her yourself.

35:34.095 --> 35:36.975
'AC-12 interview, DI Lindsay Denton

35:36.976 --> 35:39.497
'and Federation rep
DI Samuel Royal...'

35:41.577 --> 35:44.177
Sorry, Tom, can I call you back?

35:44.178 --> 35:45.938
Five minutes, mate, cheers.

35:57.020 --> 35:58.541
I'm moving you up.

35:59.701 --> 36:01.420
Where?

36:01.421 --> 36:03.101
The 28s.

36:03.102 --> 36:04.661
Why?

36:04.662 --> 36:07.022
Quality Control are responding
to complaints that

36:07.023 --> 36:10.382
non-high-priority missing persons
are being down-processed.

36:10.383 --> 36:11.904
We've got to be seen to take action.

36:14.144 --> 36:16.385
This is because
I didn't cover for you.

36:19.185 --> 36:22.386
I've got a room full of detectives
scoring fours and fives.

36:25.067 --> 36:27.507
After the balls-up of the ambush...

36:29.028 --> 36:31.907
..you're a two, at best.

36:31.908 --> 36:34.268
I'm taking this to HR.

36:34.269 --> 36:37.750
Take it to Butler's missus,
Wallis' kids.

36:40.110 --> 36:41.590
Who's on this unit?

36:43.791 --> 36:45.950
You.

36:45.951 --> 36:47.671
And?

36:47.672 --> 36:49.551
I'll find some DC or other,

36:49.552 --> 36:51.393
if there's one who'll work with you.

36:56.194 --> 37:00.274
'Nobody's blaming you, I mean, if
those were Akers' instructions...

37:00.275 --> 37:01.715
'Akers chose the route?'

37:03.555 --> 37:04.836
'Yeah.

37:06.556 --> 37:08.756
'Vehicles turned left
into Long Lane?

37:08.757 --> 37:10.117
'Yeah.

37:12.597 --> 37:14.958
'You didn't question that decision?

37:16.718 --> 37:18.239
'No, sir.'

37:29.081 --> 37:31.561
Computer on the blink?

37:31.562 --> 37:33.242
I'm an old-fashioned girl.

37:36.323 --> 37:38.882
I listened to the tape.

37:38.883 --> 37:41.843
I thought you didn't want to get
involved. Denton picked the route.

37:41.844 --> 37:45.484
We don't know that. And tried to pin
it on Jayne Akers. She was nervous.

37:45.485 --> 37:48.165
Easiest ploy in the world -
blame the dead person.

37:58.648 --> 38:00.648
May I, sir? Sure.

38:35.416 --> 38:38.176
She said, "Just because I
reported him missing doesn't mean

38:38.177 --> 38:39.657
"I wanted him back."

38:42.057 --> 38:44.177
All right, who's for the pub? I am.

38:44.178 --> 38:45.938
Good, it's your round. OK.

39:27.028 --> 39:29.787
Thank you for making time
to see me today.

39:29.788 --> 39:32.748
As I told you on the telephone,
I'm heading up a newly formed unit

39:32.749 --> 39:35.829
that's taken over
the search for Carly.

39:35.830 --> 39:38.589
Anything we can do to help.
Before she went missing,

39:38.590 --> 39:41.750
did you notice anything unusual
about Carly's behaviour?

39:41.751 --> 39:44.230
She'd always been... difficult.

39:44.231 --> 39:46.791
A lot of them are that we take in.

39:46.792 --> 39:50.072
And how did her difficult nature
manifest itself?

39:50.073 --> 39:53.072
You try and make them stay in school,
not go out late.

39:53.073 --> 39:55.753
If they go out,
maybe it's the pictures or...

39:55.754 --> 39:58.314
Carly drifted back
into her old ways,

39:58.315 --> 40:00.754
or what they said
were her old ways -

40:00.755 --> 40:04.475
out late, drinking, smoking...
boys, too.

40:04.476 --> 40:07.676
We found a used condom in her room.

40:07.677 --> 40:09.797
We did our best not to
push her away...

40:30.802 --> 40:33.361
Yeah? Just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions, ma'am.

40:33.362 --> 40:35.562
Which should take place
following legal notice

40:35.563 --> 40:37.602
and in the presence of
my Police Federation Rep.

40:37.603 --> 40:40.523
We can do all that if you prefer,
ma'am, but you're being interviewed

40:40.524 --> 40:44.084
as a witness, not a suspect.
Yeah, I've heard that one before.

40:44.085 --> 40:46.524
We had a job to do. I'm sorry.

40:46.525 --> 40:49.365
But thanks to your cooperation,
our investigation's moving on.

40:49.366 --> 40:51.566
Look, this isn't a trap, ma'am.

40:51.567 --> 40:54.766
You're the last living person
to have had contact with DS Akers.

40:54.767 --> 40:57.248
We need to form a view of her
mental state that night.

40:58.688 --> 41:00.088
All right.

41:13.331 --> 41:15.331
How was she behaving?

41:15.332 --> 41:16.732
She was...

41:18.413 --> 41:20.532
She was on edge.

41:20.533 --> 41:23.973
Nervous. I'd say very nervous.

41:23.974 --> 41:27.214
Did she give any reason why she
wasn't in contact with her own team?

41:27.215 --> 41:28.414
No, she didn't.

41:28.415 --> 41:29.775
Did she refer to any process?

41:31.295 --> 41:33.775
Sorry, gaffer, you said you
wanted these straightaway.

41:33.776 --> 41:35.535
That's all right, thank you.

41:35.536 --> 41:38.297
That's my new DC, Kate Foster. Hi.

41:42.938 --> 41:44.417
You were saying?

41:44.418 --> 41:46.898
Did DS Akers refer to any process
of clearing her actions

41:46.899 --> 41:49.258
with her superiors? No, she didn't.

41:49.259 --> 41:52.819
Did she discuss any role played by
other members of her team?

41:52.820 --> 41:54.540
No, she didn't.

41:54.541 --> 41:57.900
As far as you could tell,
who was DS Akers working with?

41:57.901 --> 42:02.102
As far as I could tell... DS Akers
appeared to be working alone.

42:03.503 --> 42:05.943
That's been very helpful.
Thank you, ma'am.

42:19.986 --> 42:23.506
I asked Kate to check out
the operational options.

42:23.507 --> 42:26.987
Neither of us suspected she'd
get embedded so quickly.

42:26.988 --> 42:29.668
There was an unfilled
post for Denton's DC.

42:29.669 --> 42:33.948
Yeah, well, a heads-up would have
been nice. Do you want a row?

42:33.949 --> 42:37.029
What the hell were you doing there,
anyway, interviewing Denton again?

42:37.030 --> 42:40.351
We're not allowed to investigate
Akers, so I asked Denton about her.

42:42.191 --> 42:44.312
Full marks for ingenuity, son.

42:45.352 --> 42:48.432
Supposing Akers was
the inside woman.

42:48.433 --> 42:49.753
Sorry, Steve.

42:51.833 --> 42:53.234
All right? Hi.

42:54.314 --> 42:55.953
Thanks for coming.

42:55.954 --> 42:57.955
Steve, meet the trouble and strife.

43:01.476 --> 43:03.115
Have you been here before, Steve?

43:03.116 --> 43:06.356
I haven't, no. It looks a nice place.
Yeah. We've heard some good things,

43:06.357 --> 43:08.516
haven't we, love? Oh,
and speaking of good things.

43:08.517 --> 43:11.237
I'm not late, am I? Sorry, sorry.

43:11.238 --> 43:13.037
I'm Roisin. Georgia.

43:13.038 --> 43:15.839
Drink, Steve? I'm still on
this beer, thanks. Georgia?

43:17.839 --> 43:19.319
If anyone fancies wine...

43:19.320 --> 43:21.639
Yep. Wine list, please.
Oh. You're on beer.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.240
Do you want one?

43:23.241 --> 43:25.201
Sorry, a beer here, please.

43:27.161 --> 43:29.921
So, Steve's been in
AC for a year now

43:29.922 --> 43:33.162
and every day has
felt like a lifetime.

43:33.163 --> 43:35.442
That'd make me about your age, sir.

43:35.443 --> 43:38.363
He also likes the banter,
the cheeky wee b... Ted.

43:38.364 --> 43:41.644
"Boy" - I was going to say,
"Cheeky, wee boy."

43:41.645 --> 43:44.244
You're new to Ted's unit?

43:44.245 --> 43:46.045
Transferred from Armed Robbery.

43:46.046 --> 43:48.245
You'll be at home here, then...

43:48.246 --> 43:49.606
with these prices.

43:50.767 --> 43:52.207
Thanks.

44:39.978 --> 44:42.497
That was very generous, thanks, sir.
Thanks, sir.

44:42.498 --> 44:45.098
Pleasure. Lovely meeting you both.

44:45.099 --> 44:46.938
See you tomorrow, then.

44:46.939 --> 44:49.019
Night. Night-night.
Night-night.

44:49.020 --> 44:50.260
Night, boss. Night.

44:54.901 --> 44:56.981
Do you need a lift?

44:56.982 --> 44:59.261
Bus stop's just here.

44:59.262 --> 45:00.462
Well, I'm that way.

45:02.263 --> 45:03.783
You OK to drive?

45:11.105 --> 45:12.905
Do you fancy a nightcap?

45:18.106 --> 45:21.746
What are you having? I'll get these.
I insist. All right. Beer.

45:21.747 --> 45:23.907
Whatever they've got.

45:23.908 --> 45:28.948
Pint of, er, Peroni,
half of Pilsner...

45:28.949 --> 45:30.469
and a double vodka.

45:47.273 --> 45:48.593
Thank you for that.

45:57.515 --> 45:59.716
You always wanted to try the place.

46:12.559 --> 46:14.999
I got you out in false pretences?
Is that it?

46:17.520 --> 46:20.720
I didn't detect any pressing reason
for keeping up appearances.

46:22.841 --> 46:24.361
I'm their boss.

46:26.882 --> 46:30.603
And picking up the bill -
that really took the prize!

46:32.003 --> 46:33.643
For my benefit, was it?

46:47.326 --> 46:49.366
Bottles now?

46:49.367 --> 46:51.847
Work in the morning.
Oh, that little thing.

46:58.729 --> 47:00.288
When I first arrived,

47:00.289 --> 47:03.689
what did you say to Hastings,
when you were alone in the office?

47:03.690 --> 47:05.530
Just talking operational parameters.

47:06.691 --> 47:09.170
You're such a crap liar.

47:09.171 --> 47:11.452
Look, I just wanted to know
more about you.

47:13.492 --> 47:15.332
All right.

47:15.333 --> 47:19.052
Here are three facts about me
but one of them is false.

47:19.053 --> 47:21.333
You've bitten off more
than you can chew, Trotman.

47:21.334 --> 47:24.614
I do this for a living.
Well, let's see, shall we?

47:24.615 --> 47:26.415
I'm a gifted horsewoman.

47:27.695 --> 47:31.055
I won a poetry competition
when I was 11.

47:31.056 --> 47:32.977
I'm a secret pool hustler.

47:38.258 --> 47:40.858
You don't know one end of
a pool cue from the other.

48:10.705 --> 48:12.624
Is it so hard to comprehend,

48:12.625 --> 48:15.146
a man wanting to spend
the evening with his wife?

48:21.347 --> 48:22.828
This hurts me, too.

48:52.314 --> 48:56.635
This is a really stupid idea.
Yeah, best not. Best not.

48:58.876 --> 49:00.756
Which was the false one by the way?

49:03.357 --> 49:04.797
A girl never tells.

50:00.690 --> 50:02.090
What do you want?

50:09.492 --> 50:13.653
I...will... not... take... it...
any... more.

51:06.024 --> 51:08.064
Yeah, thanks for that.
Stay in touch.

51:08.065 --> 51:09.345
Cheers.

51:15.947 --> 51:19.026
News from the hospital. The docs
are going to try the witness

51:19.027 --> 51:21.627
off the ventilator later on today.
He's on the mend.

51:21.628 --> 51:22.987
When do we get to interview him?

51:22.988 --> 51:24.988
Oh, rest assured,
our foot is in the door.

51:24.989 --> 51:27.988
If anyone's got answers
to the questions, he has.

51:27.989 --> 51:31.110
Good craic last night, you two. Huh?

51:43.833 --> 51:45.433
This is so reductive.

51:48.154 --> 51:51.994
I'm concerned there's a news vacuum,
and what'll be used to fill it.

51:51.995 --> 51:54.834
The Chief Constable's as concerned
as I am about any leak

51:54.835 --> 51:57.995
that a police officer
might've been an accomplice.

51:57.996 --> 52:02.156
We're looking at using anti-terror
legislation to keep a lid on it.

52:02.157 --> 52:05.157
You can't invite them to dinner
and not serve pudding.

52:05.158 --> 52:08.797
I need a breakthrough.
I didn't say that.

52:08.798 --> 52:11.119
We need to keep the bastards
onside, that's all.

52:21.801 --> 52:23.921
Are you any nearer finding
those responsible?

52:23.922 --> 52:26.441
We're pursuing several,
productive lines of inquiry.

52:26.442 --> 52:28.922
I'm very pleased with the progress
of the investigation.

52:28.923 --> 52:30.563
Yeah. But do you have any suspects?

52:34.164 --> 52:35.724
A breakthrough is imminent.

52:40.445 --> 52:42.365
'Deputy Chief Constable
Michael Dryden

52:42.366 --> 52:45.286
'has taken personal charge
of the investigation...

52:45.287 --> 52:47.166
'A breakthrough is imminent.'

52:47.167 --> 52:48.767
Knob.

52:51.048 --> 52:53.047
Anything I can do, boss?

52:53.048 --> 52:55.528
Just need to run an errand.
Be back in half an hour.

52:55.529 --> 52:57.649
Drive you? No need.

54:10.466 --> 54:12.265
'Telecommunications.'

54:12.266 --> 54:15.866
DC Fleming, requesting urgent
identification on the last number

54:15.867 --> 54:17.906
dialled from a payphone
on the corner of

54:17.907 --> 54:20.907
Ridgeway Street and Sandhurst Lane.
'Received.'

54:20.908 --> 54:22.988
Thanks. Get back to me
as soon as you can.

54:48.874 --> 54:53.714
DC Fleming. 'DC Fleming, we have
the call ID you requested.'

54:53.715 --> 54:55.035
Go ahead.

54:55.036 --> 54:57.756
'It's the main switchboard
number of the General Hospital.'

54:59.597 --> 55:00.677
Thanks.

55:11.879 --> 55:12.999
Kate?

55:13.000 --> 55:15.879
Denton just made a call to the
hospital from a payphone.

55:15.880 --> 55:17.921
Get over there, Steve.
Check on the witness.

55:19.921 --> 55:21.162
Georgia.

55:38.846 --> 55:41.965
DS Arnott. 'Steve, I've been
on to the hospital.'

55:41.966 --> 55:44.566
There's no answer from the Guard
Unit. I've got someone else

55:44.567 --> 55:47.407
trying again. If you just get up
there as fast as you can, OK?

56:16.334 --> 56:17.974
'Sixth floor.

56:19.735 --> 56:21.214
'Doors closing.'

56:21.215 --> 56:22.535
Where's the guards?

56:31.457 --> 56:32.858
You good to go?

56:36.458 --> 56:38.659
Yeah. You sure?

56:44.380 --> 56:45.620
Yeah.

57:13.347 --> 57:14.907
Nurse? Where's the...?

57:18.548 --> 57:20.428
Help! Help!
