00:10.802 --> 00:13.179
Good morning, beautiful people.

00:13.221 --> 00:13.763
Oh, someone's in a good mood.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.890
Or hit the wet bar
a little too early.

00:15.932 --> 00:17.142
You ever have one
of those mornings

00:17.183 --> 00:19.519
where you wake up,
the sun is shining

00:19.561 --> 00:21.062
and you just say
to yourself,

00:21.104 --> 00:22.814
"Wow, life's good"?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.274
It's great, even.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.442
I've lost my appetite.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.319
Whoa. What's not great

00:28.361 --> 00:29.738
are those dark circles
under your eyes.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.197
No offense, Sam,

00:31.239 --> 00:32.407
but you look terrible.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.034
I'm scheduling facials
for us later.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.578
Don't bother. I'm busy.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.080
What's going on with him?

00:39.122 --> 00:41.624
He usually loves a good
milk and honey detox.

00:41.666 --> 00:43.126
Uh, maybe,
but he probably doesn't love

00:43.168 --> 00:44.753
being told he looks terrible.

00:44.794 --> 00:46.212
Especially when
he's been in the hospital

00:46.254 --> 00:48.131
with his dying father
the last few nights.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.340
Daniel's dying?

00:49.382 --> 00:50.759
Why didn't you guys
say anything?

00:50.800 --> 00:51.801
Well, we thought you knew.

00:51.843 --> 00:52.844
No, I didn't know.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.596
And now I feel awful.

00:54.637 --> 00:55.972
Does he need anything?

00:56.014 --> 00:57.682
Probably just the
support of his friends.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.185
Yeah, yeah, I know that,
I'm just trying to think

01:00.226 --> 01:01.394
of something
a little more tangible

01:01.436 --> 01:03.063
and less time-consuming.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.232
Okay, well, I'll think
of something. Oh, my God...

01:06.274 --> 01:09.819
Well, speaking of feeling awful,
how's living with Alexis?

01:09.861 --> 01:11.863
It's actually been
going quite well.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.948
I feel like we've finally
settled into a nice dynamic

01:13.990 --> 01:16.159
based on honesty and respect.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.578
Honesty and respect?
You know I said Alexis, right?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.413
Because you should
proceed with caution.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.041
She's not exactly known
for putting her children first.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.126
That's funny, 'cause she, uh,

01:25.168 --> 01:27.128
she said a similar thing
about you.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.172
Wait, is it true
that you left Adam

01:29.214 --> 01:30.924
in a Moldavian prison?

01:30.965 --> 01:33.218
'Cause I get it,
he's no prize,

01:33.259 --> 01:34.928
but seems
a little bit harsh, no?

01:34.969 --> 01:36.930
Yeah, I would say so.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.765
Which is why it never happened.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.475
This is just
another example

01:40.517 --> 01:42.227
of why you should take
everything Alexis says

01:42.268 --> 01:44.062
with a bucket of salt.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.397
(phone chimes)
Oh, let me guess.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.191
That's probably her wondering
what you're doing here.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.734
No, it's actually Kirby.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.027
Oh, I didn't know
you two were friends.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.403
Yeah, we've been, um...

01:52.445 --> 01:53.905
getting closer these days,

01:53.947 --> 01:55.615
and-- uh, she's just been
really supportive

01:55.657 --> 01:58.326
and she's so funny and pretty...

01:59.536 --> 02:00.870
...smart.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.540
Pretty smart.
So, yeah, we're friends.

02:03.581 --> 02:06.126
Well, that makes me happy.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.670
You know, her father
was the best friend I ever had.

02:08.711 --> 02:09.921
As a matter of fact,
if he was here right now,

02:09.963 --> 02:11.631
he could tell you
some stories about Alexis

02:11.673 --> 02:13.675
that you just would not believe.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.304
Jeff Colby.

02:18.346 --> 02:19.889
What an unwelcome
surprise.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.183
Okay, I don't have time
for unpleasantries.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.477
Plenexia's open house is
just a few hours away,

02:24.519 --> 02:26.396
and I still don't have the
invite you promised me.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.606
You mean... (gasps)
...this invite?

02:28.648 --> 02:29.732
Not so fast.

02:29.774 --> 02:31.526
Do you know how terrible

02:31.568 --> 02:33.361
of an idea it is
to steal a drug formula?

02:33.403 --> 02:35.363
You will get caught
and you'll get put in jail.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.198
Actually, wait,
now I'm thinking about it.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.616
That might not be
the worst thing.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.161
Nobody will be able to trace
this back to me, okay?

02:41.202 --> 02:42.370
Once I have
the formula,

02:42.412 --> 02:43.663
I'll post it open-source,

02:43.705 --> 02:45.081
so other companies
can make the drug

02:45.123 --> 02:46.499
for what it should cost.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.793
A leak at this level
will cause immediate damage.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.255
Plenexia will lose business
and investors will lose faith.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.590
And you've lost my attention.

02:53.631 --> 02:54.966
Just make sure I get
my Bokocho extract

02:55.008 --> 02:56.926
when you're done.
You mean when we're done.

02:56.968 --> 03:00.722
No, I'm-I'm not getting roped
into some James Bond sideshow.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.891
You're an invited guest
who won't raise any red flags.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.726
I need your help
to make this happen,

03:04.767 --> 03:06.144
and if I don't
succeed?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.312
I'll eat those plants

03:07.353 --> 03:08.897
before I give them back to you.

03:08.938 --> 03:10.940
So, your call.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.484
NINA:
We have a fashion emergency.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.778
MICHAEL:
Well, I wouldn't call it
an emergency, but yeah,

03:15.820 --> 03:18.615
you could try wearing a dress
every once in a while.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.158
Sexism. Charming.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.451
We do have
a dress problem, though.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.953
Our off-the-runway dress
from Milan

03:23.995 --> 03:25.663
is held up in customs.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.040
So? We'll just get one locally.

03:27.081 --> 03:29.584
Right. But this dress
needs to be brand-new,

03:29.626 --> 03:33.254
from an up-and-coming designer
and here by this afternoon.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.048
Oh, and cheap, since
there's no money left

03:35.089 --> 03:37.175
for it in our wardrobe budget
thanks to your girlfriend

03:37.217 --> 03:39.135
being in the movie.
Okay, what about

03:39.177 --> 03:40.637
the magazine deal we made,
for first-look pictures

03:40.678 --> 03:42.055
of Janelle as Farrah?

03:42.096 --> 03:44.224
That's what we need
the dress for.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.935
The money from that deal
is our entire marketing budget.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.812
We don't see a cent until
after they get the pictures.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.356
But I have a solution.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.692
So there's not
a fashion emergency? Got it.

03:54.734 --> 03:59.530
Well, there won't be, once you
call your old costar Dominique.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.532
Please tell me you did not see

04:01.574 --> 04:03.201
the House of Deveraux
reality show.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.412
Well, I don't know whose house
you two were having sex in,

04:06.454 --> 04:07.747
but I only saw, like,
two seconds of it

04:07.789 --> 04:09.290
and then turned it off.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.833
I would contact her myself,

04:10.875 --> 04:13.378
but I'm not as intimate with her
as you are.

04:13.419 --> 04:16.214
You know, since only one of us
made a sex tape with her.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.633
Okay, that's enough.
That's not happening.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.718
But...
But I have an in
with the designers

04:20.760 --> 04:22.929
who used to dress the
acts at Club Colby.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.389
What kind of dress do we need?

04:24.430 --> 04:24.973
Something a touch conservative,

04:25.014 --> 04:27.392
but the stitching
needs to be impeccable.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.186
A reference would be
Spring 2018.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.856
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

04:33.898 --> 04:36.067
Not a clue. Text me the info
and I will reach out.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.652
Today.
Yes.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.237
Thank you.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.322
And on the playground,
I used to pretend

04:41.364 --> 04:45.493
like I was this really important
business owner,

04:45.535 --> 04:47.662
and I would hold my lunch box
like a briefcase

04:47.704 --> 04:49.914
and boss all
of the other kids around.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.791
I'm sorry I missed that,

04:51.833 --> 04:53.918
but at least I got to see you
do the real thing.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.129
And you're still pretty bossy.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.588
(both laugh)

04:57.630 --> 04:59.465
(coughing)

05:01.467 --> 05:02.635
(sighs)

05:02.677 --> 05:04.429
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.556
I think I'm even starting
to feel better.

05:07.515 --> 05:08.599
How about another story, huh?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.268
Well, there was the first time

05:10.310 --> 05:12.228
I got into competitive karaoke.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.563
Hmm.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.732
Though that got ugly
after we got to the, uh,

05:15.773 --> 05:18.484
REO Speedwagon section.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.069
SIMMS:
Mr. Jones?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.822
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.491
SAM:
Anything new?

05:25.533 --> 05:27.327
SIMMS:
Unfortunately, no.

05:27.368 --> 05:29.495
There's really nothing
we can do for your father now

05:29.537 --> 05:31.372
but keep him comfortable.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.208
N-No, he... he just told me
he's feeling better.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.418
Maybe he's
turning a corner?

05:35.460 --> 05:37.837
He's probably trying
to be brave for you.

05:37.879 --> 05:42.508
But that's not changing
the way this ends.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.345
His cancer has spread all over.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.805
How long does he have?

05:47.847 --> 05:49.682
A few weeks
at the most,

05:49.724 --> 05:52.685
but more likely, a few days.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.688
I wish I had better news.

06:02.528 --> 06:05.615
Drinking Scotch this early
only means one thing.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.075
Alexis, right?

06:07.116 --> 06:10.620
She's still trying to
poison me in Amanda's eyes.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.080
I had to lie to her
this morning.

06:12.121 --> 06:13.456
Why can't Alexis

06:13.498 --> 06:15.833
just shut her trap
and stop doling out

06:15.875 --> 06:18.086
terrible secrets
like Halloween candy?

06:18.127 --> 06:19.754
Well, maybe if you did fewer
terrible things

06:19.796 --> 06:21.631
there would be fewer secrets?

06:23.925 --> 06:26.719
Cristal, y-you beautiful genius.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.013
I'll look bad if
I bad-mouth Alexis,

06:29.055 --> 06:31.307
so I'll go the other way,
like Michelle Obama.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.517
One of the only
times a Democrat

06:32.558 --> 06:33.851
had a good idea.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.603
Alexis goes low, I'll go high.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.189
I don't think you should
compare yourself to Michelle.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.483
Of course not. Michelle's not
even in my league, but this,

06:40.525 --> 06:41.859
this is perfect.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.486
I'll elevate myself
instead of denigrating

06:43.528 --> 06:45.029
that venomous snake.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.448
Toning down the insults
might be a good starting point.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.367
Duly noted, I'm just
getting it out before I start.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.827
Do you think
that I should set up

06:50.868 --> 06:52.745
some more father-daughter
mani-pedis?

06:52.787 --> 06:55.623
Amanda's a little too smart
to be swayed by a spa day.

06:55.665 --> 06:59.502
She needs to feel useful,
not like a Barbie doll.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.422
FALLON:
I just came to apologize,

07:02.463 --> 07:04.215
and to make sure you're okay.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.259
I would've never been
so insensitive over breakfast

07:06.300 --> 07:07.677
had I known.

07:07.718 --> 07:09.220
Why didn't you tell me?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.930
I'm sorry I didn't
stop my bedside vigil

07:10.972 --> 07:12.598
to update you
on my dying father,

07:12.640 --> 07:15.977
but maybe we can
discuss it over facials.

07:16.018 --> 07:18.646
Yeah, I'm sorry
about that part, too.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.148
Fallon, my father is dying,

07:20.189 --> 07:21.607
and my mother
won't return my calls,

07:21.649 --> 07:23.818
so my big plan to reunite them

07:23.860 --> 07:26.612
before Daniel passes away
isn't happening.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.157
I'm gonna spend
this time with him,

07:29.198 --> 07:31.159
and not trying
to make you feel less guilty.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.910
This is not about you.

07:35.955 --> 07:40.001
I know exactly what
I'm gonna do for Sam.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.794
I am gonna find Iris
and bring her back here

07:41.836 --> 07:43.379
before Daniel dies.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.673
Didn't Sam just tell you
not to make this about you?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.216
Oh, he'll thank me
when it's over.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.759
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.303
Now let's go find

07:50.344 --> 07:52.763
the woman who kidnapped me
and who knows,

07:52.805 --> 07:54.932
maybe we'll kidnap her back.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.018
♪ ♪

08:06.027 --> 08:08.362
(groans)

08:08.404 --> 08:12.408
Okay, don't get mad,
I'm just not entirely clear

08:12.450 --> 08:14.160
on why we're flying to Idaho.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.369
I knew you weren't listening.

08:15.411 --> 08:16.704
The last time

08:16.746 --> 08:18.372
Iris was in Atlanta,
she kidnapped me

08:18.414 --> 08:19.790
on Alejandro's orders.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.626
But after he died,
she was still worried

08:21.667 --> 08:22.919
that people were
gonna come after her.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.879
So Cristal gave her some money
from my ransom

08:24.921 --> 08:26.297
to start a new life.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.341
How does that help us?
Well,

08:28.382 --> 08:31.260
Iris didn't know that she had a
bag of marked bills, but I did.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.596
So I had my PI
trace that money

08:33.638 --> 08:36.140
to a very large donation made
to a church in Covington, Idaho.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.350
And apparently,

08:37.391 --> 08:38.643
he got a tip that somebody

08:38.684 --> 08:40.228
saw her leaving a motel nearby.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.063
And that's kind of
where the trail ran cold.

08:42.104 --> 08:44.398
So Iris is in Covington. Got it.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.275
Well, you know,
she may be in Covington.

08:46.317 --> 08:49.695
But at the very least, that
should lead us to our next clue.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.531
We all have to do is talk
to the priest in charge

08:51.572 --> 08:53.157
and find out what he knows.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.826
Okay, so recap,
we're going to a church

08:55.868 --> 08:58.162
to look for a woman
who doesn't want to be found

08:58.204 --> 09:00.831
to help someone who doesn't want
you meddling in his life.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.500
I don't recall
asking for a recap.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.544
And you're gonna need
a big attitude adjustment

09:04.585 --> 09:06.504
if we're going to have
any fun on this trip.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.089
Mmm.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.632
What's the big emergency?

09:09.674 --> 09:11.634
You made it sound like time
was of the essence.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.136
Mainly because you kept saying
"time is of the essence."

09:14.178 --> 09:16.764
It is. I'm meeting some
high-level British executives

09:16.806 --> 09:18.474
about a business deal,
and I need

09:18.516 --> 09:19.809
a crash course in...

09:20.893 --> 09:23.271
...high tea etiquette.

09:23.312 --> 09:26.274
Um, okay, well,
we may need to discuss

09:26.315 --> 09:29.944
our definition of "emergency"
later, but, uh,

09:29.986 --> 09:32.738
as your resident expert
in all things British,

09:32.780 --> 09:34.323
I'm at your service.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.867
So let's begin with the first
and most important rule of all,

09:36.909 --> 09:37.577
Which is pinky down.

09:37.618 --> 09:41.497
Never up. Oh, and you should
hold the cup by the handle.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.917
Okay, that's a start.
Next up, the stir.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.003
You have to make sure
that you never

09:47.044 --> 09:48.838
clink the inside of the cup.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.131
That's considered rude.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.509
See? You're a natural.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.678
Don't shortchange
your teaching skills.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.471
(chuckles)
Mmm.

09:57.513 --> 10:00.558
You know, I... I miss
seeing you more often.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.352
I feel like I saw you a lot
when we were working together.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.437
Well, that was two days.

10:04.478 --> 10:06.105
True, but I saw you both days.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.065
(chuckles)
Maybe you
could consult

10:08.107 --> 10:10.359
for PPA, like,
on an as-needed basis?

10:10.401 --> 10:12.528
Well, I'm happy to help you
with anything you need--

10:12.570 --> 10:14.238
and I am gonna bill you
for the tea--

10:14.280 --> 10:16.073
but, um, I hope you know

10:16.115 --> 10:18.743
that you don't have to pay me
to have father-daughter time.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.036
Well, even better.

10:21.412 --> 10:24.415
So, do you really enjoy
staying at the penthouse?

10:24.457 --> 10:26.250
Because if you ever...
ALEXIS: I didn't
realize Queen Elizabeth

10:26.292 --> 10:27.793
was in town.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.046
This is quite a spread.
Or is it for me?

10:30.087 --> 10:32.715
Most definitely not.
So what are you doing here?

10:32.757 --> 10:36.260
Amanda was in such a rush to
get here, she forgot her keys.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.470
These keys?

10:38.554 --> 10:40.723
Oh. I guess these are mine.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.892
So, what's going on?

10:42.933 --> 10:45.061
I'm just giving Blake
an emergency lesson

10:45.102 --> 10:46.479
in high tea etiquette.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.397
Oh, isn't that interesting?

10:48.439 --> 10:52.652
Since we took a trip to London
and had high tea every day.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.612
I don't remember that.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.238
Yes, well,
I've wiped every memory

10:56.280 --> 10:57.948
of our marriage as well.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.617
I do love a scone, though.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.702
I'll join you...
(grunts)

11:02.703 --> 11:03.704
Last one.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.206
Hmm.

11:05.247 --> 11:08.542
Don't choke. (chuckles)

11:08.584 --> 11:10.461
I just hope this thing between
Farrah and I didn't make you

11:10.503 --> 11:12.213
rush into anything.
CUTLER:
How so?

11:12.254 --> 11:14.882
It's just, she might not be as
excited about this as you are.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.677
(laughs)
She's wearing my ring.

11:17.718 --> 11:18.886
I'm good, bro.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.389
Great. Cut. Moving on.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.556
Hey, you got a sec?

11:22.598 --> 11:24.266
For Cutler? Anything.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.018
(mock laugh)
I still can't believe

11:26.060 --> 11:27.520
this character is based on you.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.146
Although now I understand

11:29.188 --> 11:31.565
why you kept pushing
for the hottest actor.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.943
Were you in, like,
way better shape five years ago?

11:33.984 --> 11:36.696
If you're done, I'm here
about actual business.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.280
An up-and-coming designer

11:38.322 --> 11:41.158
sent over a dress and it's
here waiting to be opened.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.869
They say it's avant-gard-ish,

11:43.911 --> 11:46.122
but they sent over
their finest, so...

11:50.000 --> 11:51.752
You clearly don't know

11:51.794 --> 11:53.629
what avant-garde means, do you?

11:53.671 --> 11:55.673
Apparently, it means
"inappropriate."

11:55.715 --> 11:57.842
Wow.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.344
After Plenexia's chemist gave me
the location of the formula,

12:00.386 --> 12:02.138
I got my hands
on the technical blueprints

12:02.179 --> 12:03.556
of their headquarters.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.141
Turns out, the formula's stored

12:05.182 --> 12:06.976
on a temperature-controlled
hard drive

12:07.017 --> 12:09.687
in a lab only accessible
by fingerprint tech.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.148
Great. So, whose finger
are we using?

12:12.189 --> 12:13.232
I mean, a mid-party
amputation,

12:13.274 --> 12:15.234
it sounds conspicuous,

12:15.276 --> 12:16.902
but could be fun.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.612
We just need a print, relax.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.072
Once I'm inside
the computer room,

12:20.114 --> 12:22.241
I won't have enough time
to hack the data,

12:22.283 --> 12:25.995
so I'll steal the hard drive
and do the rest from here.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.788
And we're supposed to do
all this without anyone noticing

12:27.830 --> 12:31.083
that we're walking out with
a supercomputer party favor?

12:31.125 --> 12:33.544
It's a small hard drive.
And this will work.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.421
Are we sure that's not
the neurotoxicity talking?

12:35.463 --> 12:36.839
I'm gonna try my best
not to strangle you

12:36.881 --> 12:38.215
for the next few hours.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.633
Now, all that's left

12:39.675 --> 12:41.010
is to find out
what's for dessert.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.845
Can we not just have
some candy before we go?

12:42.887 --> 12:44.555
You'll understand later.

12:44.597 --> 12:45.681
I don't have a lot of time,
we're about to begin

12:45.723 --> 12:47.016
our choir rehearsal.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.893
Oh, no worries, Padre.
This'll only take a moment.

12:48.934 --> 12:51.312
We're just wondering
if you remember a very large

12:51.353 --> 12:52.897
cash donation made
several years ago?

12:52.938 --> 12:54.732
Like, way larger

12:54.774 --> 12:56.942
than you'd think
for a church in Idaho?

12:56.984 --> 13:00.237
Possibly from someone
named Iris Machado.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.363
Does that ring any bells?

13:01.405 --> 13:02.406
I'm sorry, the name doesn't,

13:02.448 --> 13:04.700
but I do remember the donation.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.036
Uh, it's very rare that we're
blessed by such a large sum,

13:07.077 --> 13:08.788
but it was made anonymously.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.499
And you're sure?
No Iris Machado?

13:13.042 --> 13:15.085
I said I'm sure. I'm
sorry I could not be

13:15.127 --> 13:16.337
of more help to you,
especially since

13:16.378 --> 13:17.880
you've come such a long way.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.257
But you can find your way
back to your car, I'm sure?

13:20.299 --> 13:24.845
Yes, and if not,
then God will show us the way.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.347
Mm.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.725
Well, that was no help.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.268
Maybe there's another
priest inside there

13:31.310 --> 13:32.770
with a better memory?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.563
My God, I can't believe we
took a wasted trip to Idaho

13:34.605 --> 13:36.148
and it's not even ski season.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.777
Well, I'm not sure I agree
with you on that one.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.445
Look, as an award-winning

13:41.487 --> 13:43.572
investigative journalist...
Lame, stop.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.949
...I've learned early on
that everyone

13:44.990 --> 13:46.450
has a tell when they're lying.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.744
Padre Romero kept adjusting
his robes when he was talking.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.996
So, clearly he was nervous
and he knows more

13:51.038 --> 13:53.082
than he's letting on.
Ooh.

13:53.123 --> 13:55.042
I knew I brought you
for a reason.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.502
So Iris is in there somewhere.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.879
I just have to get inside
and find her.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.673
What? I wasn't suggesting
we break into a church,

14:00.714 --> 14:02.132
or that Iris is even
in this state.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.885
I'm just the padre knows
more than he's telling us.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.429
Don't second-guess yourself.
Take yes for an answer.

14:07.471 --> 14:08.848
Look, this is the only lead,

14:08.889 --> 14:10.683
and Daniel
is running out of time.

14:10.724 --> 14:13.143
So, what's the best way
to sneak into a church

14:13.185 --> 14:14.687
without offending God?

14:14.728 --> 14:16.647
(birds chirping)

14:23.696 --> 14:25.489
I am so glad that you're here.
I wanted to tell you

14:25.531 --> 14:27.741
not to stress about the dress?

14:27.783 --> 14:29.368
Don't worry, I took care of it.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.578
You did?

14:30.619 --> 14:34.290
Wow, nicely done.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.542
Glad you like it.
It's one of my favorites.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.835
I still don't know why

14:37.877 --> 14:38.836
you didn't call me
in the first place.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.837
NINA:
Nothing he does

14:39.879 --> 14:42.172
really makes sense to me.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.092
I didn't call you because I know
you don't do anything for free,

14:45.134 --> 14:47.136
or anything
that doesn't help Dom.

14:47.177 --> 14:47.761
But it does help me.

14:47.803 --> 14:50.097
Dressing Janelle Crowley
will be great press

14:50.139 --> 14:52.558
for my NordicStar Airlines
competition.

14:52.600 --> 14:55.102
Besides, I hear
I'm all you've got.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.230
You're right about that.
So I guess we're doing this.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.524
I should have a photographer
shoot my work.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.193
Mm, no, no. That is
the one thing you cannot do.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.571
We made a first-look deal
with a magazine for Janelle.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.448
So no pictures
of her in that dress.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.782
Okay, fine.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.993
Can you please just try
and behave?

15:11.035 --> 15:12.995
Anything you do
is a reflection on me.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.413
LIAM:
I'm not sure

15:14.455 --> 15:15.956
this is gonna work.

15:15.998 --> 15:16.665
Is there a plan B?

15:16.707 --> 15:20.127
FALLON:
No need for a plan B.
I'll blend in perfectly.

15:22.212 --> 15:24.048
Wow.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.759
That is one bad habit.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.552
I know, it's a little
more fun than nun,

15:28.594 --> 15:30.471
but it's all they had
at the costume store.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.015
(gasps) Okay. Here they are.
I'll be back soon.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.479
Hi.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.023
Leave the judgment
to God, okay, Sister?

15:43.067 --> 15:44.276
BLAKE:
I've got coffee.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.694
AMANDA:
How did you know?

15:45.736 --> 15:47.655
I've been trapped in here
for hours.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.740
It's not high tea, but I thought
it would sweeten the deal.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.075
I have some
PPA documents

15:51.116 --> 15:52.701
I was hoping
you could take a look at,

15:52.743 --> 15:54.662
although it looks like
you've got a lot to do here.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.871
No, I would be happy to.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.414
Uh, you could've
just sent these over.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.707
Yeah, I know,
but I wanted

15:58.749 --> 16:00.834
to tell you about an idea I had.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.753
I'd like
to throw a party

16:02.795 --> 16:04.838
in honor of Kirby
when she gets back.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.966
Oh, I didn't realize
you two were so close.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.676
Oh, no, we're not,
but I-I know that you are,

16:08.717 --> 16:09.885
and I want to do
something nice for her

16:09.927 --> 16:10.552
after the rough year she's had.

16:10.594 --> 16:14.056
Well, I think it's a great idea.
That's very sweet.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.474
Oh, speaking of,
do you have any sugar...

16:15.516 --> 16:16.600
Wow.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.060
(both chuckle)

16:18.102 --> 16:19.728
Oh, one more thing.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.730
I'm sure you know this,
but it's probably best

16:21.772 --> 16:24.400
if you didn't tell your mother
about this little celebration.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.484
Alexis? Why?

16:25.526 --> 16:26.777
Oh, maybe you don't know.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.362
Um, Alexis doesn't

16:28.404 --> 16:30.114
exactly have a soft spot
for Kirby.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.532
They've had some issues--
You know what?

16:31.573 --> 16:33.909
It is not my place
to tell tales out of school.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.953
Well, maybe not,
but it is important to me

16:35.995 --> 16:37.413
to know the full story.

16:37.454 --> 16:41.667
Well, uh, if you insist...

16:43.419 --> 16:45.254
Aha!

16:45.295 --> 16:47.381
Iris Machado.
I knew it.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.799
Fallon Carrington?

16:48.841 --> 16:51.010
What are you
doing here?

16:51.051 --> 16:52.720
And what are you wearing?

16:52.761 --> 16:53.762
I don't really have
a lot of time,

16:53.804 --> 16:54.847
so I'm just gonna
cut to the chase.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.433
Sam has been
trying to reach you.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.268
Daniel Ruiz--

16:59.309 --> 17:01.061
his actual father--

17:01.103 --> 17:02.396
came to visit Atlanta,
and he and Sam

17:02.438 --> 17:04.815
have been building
a relationship.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.233
Which is great.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.193
But Daniel also has
terminal cancer.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.862
Which is not great.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.406
So I need you to come back
to Atlanta with me

17:12.448 --> 17:13.907
before it's too late.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.076
Have you been getting
any of Sam's messages?

17:16.118 --> 17:18.328
We're discouraged
from using phones.

17:18.370 --> 17:20.789
It's 2022.
Yes, but...

17:20.831 --> 17:22.124
Before you lie again,

17:22.166 --> 17:23.834
I'm pretty sure
that's a sin, right?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.544
You're right.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.588
I did get Sam's calls.

17:27.629 --> 17:30.132
But I made my choice
and I'm staying here.

17:30.174 --> 17:33.427
Now, if you'll excuse me...

17:33.469 --> 17:37.389
It's only fair. I mean, you
did hold me hostage first.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.435
I can't face them.

17:41.477 --> 17:45.647
I let Sam be raised
by an abusive father,

17:45.689 --> 17:49.485
and I deprived Daniel
of a beautiful son.

17:49.526 --> 17:51.487
They'll never
forgive me.

17:51.528 --> 17:53.822
And I know in my heart
that God led me here.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.657
But your family needs you.

17:55.699 --> 17:59.495
All I've ever
brought them is pain.

17:59.536 --> 18:03.499
But I'm helping people
with the work I do here.

18:03.540 --> 18:06.460
And who am I to argue with God?

18:06.502 --> 18:09.588
I made a promise,
and I'm not going to break it.

18:12.591 --> 18:13.550
Richard Payne.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.094
Just the CEO I
was looking for.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.096
Dr. Carrington.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.973
Thank you for saving me.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.268
Prudence from HR has been
talking my ear off.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.728
Ooh, hope you're not in trouble.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.147
Anyway, we just made
a huge distribution deal

18:27.189 --> 18:28.607
with one of our wholesalers,
and we've got

18:28.649 --> 18:30.776
some new medication
for your hospital to stock.

18:30.818 --> 18:31.527
Well, I'd be more than happy
to set up a meeting

18:31.568 --> 18:34.071
with the powers that be,
but it sounds like a slam dunk.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.239
Just count us in.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.949
Perfect.
And, uh, this is

18:36.990 --> 18:39.576
a show of appreciation
from the hospital.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.286
Pre-embargo Cubans?
Mm-hmm.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.705
RICHARD:
You've got good taste,
Carrington.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.415
Well, what can I say? So, uh,

18:45.457 --> 18:48.210
you want to go enjoy one
of these bad boys outside?

18:48.252 --> 18:50.295
Absolutely.
Cool. After you.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.141
So, what's our plan B?
You said we didn't need one.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.101
What have you been doing
in this car this whole time?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.853
Okay, look, we just
need to find a way

19:05.894 --> 19:08.981
to get super-churchy Iris
out of here.

19:09.022 --> 19:09.982
You don't think
this is all just some act

19:10.023 --> 19:11.817
so she can keep hiding out?
No.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.402
Clearly, she feels guilty
about the way

19:13.443 --> 19:14.987
she left things
with Sam and Daniel,

19:15.028 --> 19:17.114
but she also thinks
God wants her here.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.367
Although I'm pretty sure God
has an office in Atlanta, too.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.912
Saying God wants anything
is ridiculous. It's all fiction.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.914
Do you not believe in God?
What, you do?

19:25.956 --> 19:27.374
Of course I do.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.459
Have we really never
had this discussion?

19:29.501 --> 19:30.961
I guess not.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.297
Okay, yeah, and sure,
I believe in some kind of God,

19:33.338 --> 19:36.300
just seems that only bad things
come from organized religion.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.511
Wait, so you don't want
to baptize our baby

19:39.553 --> 19:41.388
in one of those
cute little gowns?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.765
(laughs): I hadn't really
thought about it.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.684
Y-- But dunking our baby
in dirty water

19:45.726 --> 19:48.228
so they have a shot at gaining
access to an afterlife

19:48.270 --> 19:49.605
with some dude in the sky

19:49.646 --> 19:51.982
doesn't really seem
like a good idea to me.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.776
Also, you're not
even pregnant yet.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.278
Fair point.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.906
Although, for someone
who doesn't believe in God,

19:58.947 --> 20:00.240
you sure don't have a problem

20:00.282 --> 20:02.075
calling out His name
when we're in bed.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.453
Okay, also a fair point.

20:04.494 --> 20:08.373
Okay, clearly, we have more
to discuss, but for right now,

20:08.415 --> 20:09.791
I'm gonna need you
to put your beliefs aside

20:09.833 --> 20:12.127
and get your Jesus on.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.087
So listen very carefully.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.382
You're very quiet.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.593
If you think I look awful
in these, you should say so.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.802
I can take the criticism,

20:20.844 --> 20:22.763
because we still have
time for retouching.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.057
So?

20:25.098 --> 20:28.143
So, um... I heard
that Kirby was on drugs.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.561
What's the story behind that?

20:29.603 --> 20:31.146
(coughs)

20:31.188 --> 20:34.399
Wow, um,
didn't see that one coming.

20:34.441 --> 20:37.611
Uh, yes, unfortunately,
that's true.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.238
Though not surprising.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.530
Okay, and just out of curiosity,

20:40.572 --> 20:42.824
did you have anything
to do with that?

20:42.866 --> 20:44.493
What exactly are you
accusing me of?

20:44.534 --> 20:46.620
Being her drug pusher?
No, of course not.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.705
I'm just saying,
Kirby and I are getting closer,

20:48.747 --> 20:51.416
and I would like
to hear about her past.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.793
Well, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

20:52.834 --> 20:54.711
but Kirby is the bad news.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.631
She's a troubled girl.
It's really very sad.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.967
Okay, well, is it true
that you persuaded

21:00.008 --> 21:03.053
her ex-boyfriend to just show up
and start making problems?

21:03.095 --> 21:06.390
Where is this coming from?
Did Kirby tell you about it?

21:06.431 --> 21:07.641
Okay.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.977
Yes, that is true.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.520
But I was protecting Adam.

21:11.561 --> 21:12.938
I can't be held responsible

21:12.980 --> 21:14.398
for Kirby jumping back
into old habits.

21:14.439 --> 21:18.235
Just take my advice:
keep your distance.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.654
Okay, but she's changed.
I mean, she's sober now.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.364
Does she not deserve
a second chance?

21:22.406 --> 21:25.450
More like a 22nd chance.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.745
Look, you know I don't like
to say bad things about people.

21:28.787 --> 21:31.373
(chuckles)
At night.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.208
But Kirby is rotten to the core.

21:33.250 --> 21:36.086
And that kind of fruit
doesn't ripen, it spoils.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.088
What exactly is it
you see in her?

21:38.130 --> 21:39.715
She's been a really good friend.

21:39.756 --> 21:42.592
It's your life. You can be
friends with anyone you want.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.762
But you should know that Kirby
is not allowed in the penthouse.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.098
She would probably steal
everything and sell it for

21:48.140 --> 21:49.725
heroin and PCP.

21:49.766 --> 21:52.060
Okay, I think that's
a little bit extreme, don't you?

21:52.102 --> 21:54.730
Well, if it were up to me, that
ex of hers would have taken her

21:54.771 --> 21:56.398
back to Australia
where she belongs.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.444
Wow. Feel like
I'm finally seeing the Alexis

22:00.485 --> 22:02.487
I've heard so much about.

22:02.529 --> 22:04.990
And I don't particularly
like the view.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.659
Well... (sighs)

22:07.701 --> 22:09.494
Hey, I need your help.
I think someone's

22:09.536 --> 22:11.538
trying to break into
the office down the hall?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.041
Can you...?
Yeah, come on.

22:32.851 --> 22:33.977
(door clicks open)

22:37.189 --> 22:38.732
Here we go.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.734
We have a problem.
At this point,

22:40.776 --> 22:41.777
you should print that
on a T-shirt.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.362
Someone leaked multiple photos

22:43.403 --> 22:45.322
from set to the online tabloids.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.657
So?
All publicity is good publicity

22:47.699 --> 22:49.368
as long as they spell
your name right.

22:49.409 --> 22:51.370
Photos of Janelle
in Dominique's dress.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.997
The photos People magazine
was going to pay money for.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.624
And I'm guessing
they won't pay as much

22:55.665 --> 22:56.958
for second-look exclusives.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.335
Now you're getting it.
We need to look

22:58.377 --> 22:59.711
into where the leak started

22:59.753 --> 23:01.004
and stop it immediately.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.298
I don't think we'll have
to look too far.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.092
Excuse me.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.680
So I went out on a limb for you,

23:10.722 --> 23:12.766
asked you to behave,
and you just

23:12.808 --> 23:13.558
couldn't help yourself.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.978
Are you doing some kind of scene
or something? Because I'm lost.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.438
The only one acting here
would be you.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.689
Who else could benefit
from this?

23:19.731 --> 23:20.857
From what?

23:20.899 --> 23:22.317
The photo leak.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.944
I told you you couldn't
hire a photographer.

23:23.985 --> 23:26.613
Yet somehow,
a photo of Janelle

23:26.655 --> 23:29.199
in your dress ended up
in the tabloids.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.159
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.744
I told you
I wouldn't take any pictures.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.788
As usual, you were only
looking out for yourself.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.456
You're fired.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.542
Michael,
you are making a mistake.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.503
Leave, or I'll have someone
escort you out.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.349
Good evening, my child.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.767
Oh.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.477
Hello, Father...?

23:57.519 --> 24:00.856
Nicholas. I'm visiting
from a parish in the north.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.608
Minnesota.
I didn't realize

24:03.650 --> 24:05.110
we had any visiting clergy.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.695
Welcome.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.905
You seem troubled.

24:08.947 --> 24:11.074
I noticed
you lighting a candle.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.702
Was it
for anyone specific?

24:13.743 --> 24:15.287
You have good intuition.

24:15.328 --> 24:18.373
I'm worried about my family.

24:18.415 --> 24:19.791
I haven't seen them in years.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.127
You've left someone behind?

24:22.169 --> 24:26.756
Family is one of the most
important things that we have.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.593
In fact, the very foundation
of religion

24:29.634 --> 24:32.304
is rooted in the Holy Family.

24:32.345 --> 24:33.847
A father,

24:33.889 --> 24:35.974
a mother, a child.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.851
Perhaps you can visit them?

24:37.893 --> 24:40.812
I know it can be scary
to face the past,

24:40.854 --> 24:42.772
but maybe
they need you right now.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.941
Thank you,

24:44.983 --> 24:49.446
but I'm afraid my sins run
too deep for their forgiveness.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.782
For now,
I'll settle for a prayer.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.285
This may surprise you.

24:56.953 --> 24:59.498
But even I've struggled
with religion in the past.

24:59.539 --> 25:01.249
I feared

25:01.291 --> 25:04.252
disappointing people in my life.

25:04.294 --> 25:07.589
My family, my priest, my God.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.758
But there's a verse from, uh...

25:09.799 --> 25:13.303
from Sunday school that I always
try to remind myself of.

25:14.971 --> 25:18.975
"For if you forgive men
their trespasses,

25:19.017 --> 25:21.436
your heavenly Father
will also forgive you."

25:21.478 --> 25:24.356
In other words, forgive,

25:24.397 --> 25:27.150
and you'll be forgiven.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.653
Even if it's yourself
you have to forgive.

25:30.320 --> 25:34.533
I hope these words bring you the
same comfort they've brought me.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.454
I'm so sorry.
I guess he got away.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.039
Could have been
a maintenance man.

25:41.081 --> 25:43.041
You know, if his uniform was
brighter, I'd be able to tell.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.585
MAN (over radio):
Attention: we've got
a 16-2 in progress.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.587
A silent alarm tripped
in computer lab 107.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.799
Cameras spotted a man
leaving with a green cooler.

25:58.181 --> 26:00.350
(loud,
overlapping crowd chatter)

26:01.643 --> 26:04.521
Check everyone
with a green cooler!

26:04.563 --> 26:06.523
That hard drive does
not leave the premises.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.085
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
realize you were hungry.

26:27.127 --> 26:29.045
I would've saved you
the last bite.

26:35.510 --> 26:38.054
Amanda!
This was a pleasant surprise.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.889
We weren't expecting
to see you tonight.

26:39.931 --> 26:40.932
Is everything okay?

26:40.974 --> 26:42.350
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:42.392 --> 26:44.686
Um, I'm sorry
for showing up so late,

26:44.728 --> 26:46.646
and I know
that this is a huge imposition,

26:46.688 --> 26:48.898
but I was just wondering
if I could maybe stay here

26:48.940 --> 26:50.317
for a little while?

26:50.358 --> 26:51.610
Trouble in penthouse paradise?

26:51.651 --> 26:54.112
Yeah, Alexis and I are not
seeing eye to eye

26:54.154 --> 26:57.324
on certain things, and I just
think we need some time apart.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.326
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,

26:59.367 --> 27:01.745
though I do understand
the feeling.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.497
Sometimes we just don't know
our parents like we think we do.

27:04.539 --> 27:07.417
But you can talk to me
anytime you need to.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.127
Thank you both so much.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.170
It's actually nice
to have people

27:10.211 --> 27:11.212
that I can really rely on.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.339
I just have to go
and get the rest

27:12.380 --> 27:13.423
of my things
from the penthouse.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.674
Don't you worry about that.

27:14.716 --> 27:15.925
I'll send someone
tomorrow morning

27:15.967 --> 27:17.344
to gather the rest
of your things.

27:17.385 --> 27:18.637
You just make yourself
comfortable here.

27:18.678 --> 27:19.846
Would you show

27:19.888 --> 27:21.598
Amanda to the
Rose room, please?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.600
She's gonna be staying there
for the time being.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.685
Thank you.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.230
Well, you did it.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.232
Amanda's moving in.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.818
Seems like a lot of trouble
just to upset Alexis.

27:33.860 --> 27:35.820
You know,
the funny thing is,

27:35.862 --> 27:38.198
doesn't actually have anything
to do with Alexis.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.824
It doesn't?
I just want

27:39.866 --> 27:41.701
to make the most
out of having my daughter here.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.746
Since she's come
into our lives, it's...

27:44.788 --> 27:47.457
really made me think about how
I screwed up things with Steven.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.459
I really wasn't there for him.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.920
And, well, I know
she's not a replacement,

27:51.961 --> 27:54.506
but...

27:54.547 --> 27:56.925
does feel like a second chance.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.386
I want...

27:59.427 --> 28:01.221
(wheezing, coughing)

28:01.262 --> 28:03.223
You don't need
to talk right now.

28:03.264 --> 28:05.642
Just rest. It's okay.
No.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.352
I need to say something.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.063
I always knew

28:10.105 --> 28:12.232
you were my son.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.610
But I never imagined

28:15.652 --> 28:17.696
you would make me this proud.

28:19.656 --> 28:22.242
I know
it hasn't been long, but...

28:22.283 --> 28:26.413
I feel like
I've known you... forever.

28:26.454 --> 28:28.540
I feel the same way.

28:30.750 --> 28:34.421
You know, growing up,
I never felt any love

28:34.462 --> 28:36.548
from the man
I thought was my father.

28:36.589 --> 28:38.508
But then, you came along, and

28:38.550 --> 28:41.386
you showed me
what a father's love can be.

28:43.096 --> 28:44.681
So thank you for that.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.016
Sam?

28:50.770 --> 28:52.856
Fallon, I know you want to talk,

28:52.897 --> 28:54.899
but right now, I need
to focus on my father.

28:54.941 --> 28:57.026
I get it.
You don't want to see me,

28:57.068 --> 29:00.697
but maybe there's someone else
you would like to see.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.037
Mama.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.123
You came.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.958
I wasn't sure

29:12.000 --> 29:13.710
if you were getting my messages.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.713
I couldn't bring myself
to face you,

29:16.755 --> 29:20.133
but the Lord-- and Fallon--

29:20.175 --> 29:23.636
made me realize it's never
too late to apologize.

29:25.722 --> 29:29.934
So I'm here now,
and I'm so sorry.

29:43.698 --> 29:46.367
Hola, Daniel.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.537
What's up?

29:49.579 --> 29:51.539
Well, they found the source
of the photo leak.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.958
It wasn't Dominique.
What? What do you mean?
Of course it was.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.044
They actually traced the photos
back to your girlfriend.

29:56.085 --> 29:57.879
Sasha?

29:58.463 --> 30:01.424
What reason could she possibly
have to sabotage anything?

30:01.466 --> 30:03.134
Well, she didn't do it
on purpose.

30:03.176 --> 30:05.720
Sasha is-- putting it nicely--
not the brightest.

30:05.762 --> 30:09.599
While she was on set, she posted
pictures to her private IG,

30:09.641 --> 30:12.101
and those did not
stay private for long.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.521
I think
you owe someone a big apology.
Okay.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.022
I will take care of it.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.274
Good. Because I definitely
wasn't offering.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.401
Now, what are we gonna do
about this lost money?

30:20.443 --> 30:22.028
Oh, I crunched the numbers,

30:22.070 --> 30:23.863
and we're gonna have to cut
more from the wardrobe budget

30:23.905 --> 30:25.490
to afford anything
in marketing.

30:25.532 --> 30:29.285
I ran the new budget by the
costume designer, and she quit,

30:29.327 --> 30:30.620
because "she couldn't possibly

30:30.662 --> 30:32.080
make the actors look
good with that budget."

30:32.121 --> 30:34.916
So we have no money
and no costume designer?

30:34.958 --> 30:37.126
Nope.
Great.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.795
You know, none of this
would've happened

30:38.837 --> 30:40.713
if you'd just picked
a better girlfriend.

30:40.755 --> 30:43.341
Oh, so who do you think
I should be dating?

30:43.383 --> 30:45.051
Someone smart and...

30:45.093 --> 30:47.554
and together,
who can actually challenge you.

30:47.595 --> 30:49.472
Well, that sounds
a lot like you.

30:49.514 --> 30:52.225
Are you asking me on a date?

30:52.267 --> 30:53.852
I hate to crush
your dreams there, buddy,

30:53.893 --> 30:55.854
but that is definitely
not happening again.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.981
Why don't you just focus
on fixing the budget

30:58.022 --> 31:00.316
so we can finish this movie
in the n-next two weeks?

31:00.358 --> 31:02.485
I'm on it.
Good. Let me know how it goes

31:02.527 --> 31:04.696
with Dominique.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.823
(chuckles softly)

31:06.865 --> 31:09.033
I can't tell you

31:09.075 --> 31:11.661
how happy it makes me

31:11.703 --> 31:13.663
to have my family

31:13.705 --> 31:15.248
here.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.083
It's what God wanted.

31:17.125 --> 31:20.169
It's also what I wanted.

31:21.296 --> 31:23.047
But I didn't know
if you were coming.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.799
I know.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.677
I owe you both an explanation
for what I did in the past.

31:28.887 --> 31:31.681
I've been too scared
to face it, but...

31:31.723 --> 31:33.892
you deserve that much.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.310
Please, stop.

31:36.519 --> 31:38.980
I just want
to be here now.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.733
With both of you.

31:41.774 --> 31:43.318
He's right.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.278
We shouldn't waste

31:45.320 --> 31:47.447
this moment
talking about the past.

31:47.488 --> 31:49.908
DANIEL:
I want you to be there
for each other

31:49.949 --> 31:51.659
after I'm gone.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.786
I let my pride

31:53.828 --> 31:56.122
keep me from Sam
for far too long.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.460
Don't make the same mistake

32:00.501 --> 32:02.378
with your mother.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.631
(Daniel moans)

32:04.672 --> 32:06.674
And Iris...

32:06.716 --> 32:08.509
(chuckles softly)

32:08.551 --> 32:10.887
...I forgive you.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.935
(coughing, wheezing)

32:18.728 --> 32:21.147
Gracias, mi amor.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.942
That's all
I've been waiting to hear.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.074
I forgive you, too.

32:34.577 --> 32:36.537
And I love you.

32:36.579 --> 32:38.873
Both of you.

32:51.886 --> 32:53.262
Oh, thank God.
Mm.

32:53.304 --> 32:54.764
(slurping)

32:54.806 --> 32:55.890
Thirsty?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.727
I think I tweaked my back
flying commercial.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.313
Okay, but you were still
in first class.

33:02.355 --> 33:05.191
And it's not like we could
let Iris see Father Nicholas

33:05.233 --> 33:07.402
flying home
on the Carrington jet, could we?

33:07.443 --> 33:08.903
I know, okay? And trust me,

33:08.945 --> 33:11.072
this priest will never take
the PJ for granted again.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.449
(chuckles)
Just tell me it was worth it.

33:13.491 --> 33:15.243
Yeah, it was.

33:15.284 --> 33:17.161
You should've seen the way
they looked at each other.

33:17.203 --> 33:19.789
I'm sure Sam was pretty
grateful for what you did.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.333
Well, yeah, I mean,
you know, I assume.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.876
But you didn't talk about it?

33:23.918 --> 33:26.671
No, he was busy, and I didn't
want to make it about me.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.715
Wow.

33:28.756 --> 33:31.134
Maybe you should go
to church more often.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.177
You put someone else's needs
before your own,

33:33.219 --> 33:34.846
and you also did
something really great

33:34.887 --> 33:36.889
for someone
that you truly care about.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.599
All right, well,
don't get used to it.

33:38.641 --> 33:41.102
Although maybe I will have
to get used to it

33:41.144 --> 33:42.687
once we have a baby.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.231
Oh, speaking of, I...
I did some thinking

33:45.273 --> 33:47.316
while eating stale pretzels
on the plane.

33:47.358 --> 33:49.819
Mm-hmm.
If you want to baptize our kid,

33:49.861 --> 33:51.571
I'm cool with it.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.364
Really?

33:53.406 --> 33:55.825
What ever happened
to religion is bad?

33:55.867 --> 33:57.535
I guess some of those
endless Sunday school lessons

33:57.577 --> 33:58.703
stuck with me.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.329
Well, like you said,

34:00.371 --> 34:01.789
I'm not pregnant yet,

34:01.831 --> 34:03.708
and when we do have a baptism,

34:03.750 --> 34:05.918
I'll just make sure
to bring a water filter.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.628
I do have one other request.

34:07.670 --> 34:10.298
And this goes along with my new
appreciation for religion.

34:10.339 --> 34:13.259
Now is it weird
that I cannot stop thinking

34:13.301 --> 34:15.178
about you in that nun outfit?

34:15.219 --> 34:17.805
Is there any chance you can put
that back on, we head upstairs?

34:17.847 --> 34:20.808
I do have some interest
in a missionary position.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.521
(quiet chatter)

34:25.563 --> 34:27.857
What are you going
to accuse me of now?

34:27.899 --> 34:29.609
Breaking up The Beatles?

34:29.650 --> 34:32.487
Using performance-enhancing
drugs while I sketch?

34:32.528 --> 34:33.780
Actually,

34:33.821 --> 34:35.323
I came to apologize.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.575
We found out
that Sasha was the leak,

34:37.617 --> 34:39.702
even though
she did it by mistake.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.330
So I wanted to say sorry
for accusing you

34:42.371 --> 34:44.665
and embarrassing you like that
in front of everyone.

34:44.707 --> 34:46.125
What about for being a jerk?

34:46.167 --> 34:48.377
You wouldn't even ask me
to help,

34:48.419 --> 34:50.463
and you complained
when Nina wanted me.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.966
And then you thought I tried
to sabotaged your movie.

34:54.008 --> 34:55.885
Why do you think I would do
something like that?

34:55.927 --> 34:56.886
Are you serious?

34:56.928 --> 34:58.429
Okay, first,

34:58.471 --> 35:00.348
without telling me,
you filmed us having sex,

35:00.389 --> 35:02.058
then you released it
on the Internet,

35:02.100 --> 35:04.769
then you secretly screwed me
on your reality show.

35:04.811 --> 35:05.770
You...
All right.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.355
I get it.

35:07.396 --> 35:09.565
It was a rhetorical question
anyway.

35:09.607 --> 35:12.151
Look, after our past, why
would I ever trust you again?

35:12.193 --> 35:14.862
You're not wrong.
Is that some weird way
of saying that I'm right?

35:14.904 --> 35:18.574
I know I did some unfair things
to you in the past,

35:18.616 --> 35:20.701
and I'm sorry,
but that was a long time ago.

35:20.743 --> 35:21.994
Can't you see that I've changed?

35:22.036 --> 35:23.287
Is that also rhetorical?

35:24.455 --> 35:26.624
Okay, yes, I think
you might have changed,

35:26.666 --> 35:28.084
but sometimes it's hard to tell.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.044
But I still
should not have acted

35:30.086 --> 35:33.256
the way that I did,
so I'm here with a proposition

35:33.297 --> 35:35.925
that might make it up to you.
I'm listening.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.970
Okay, our wardrobe budget took
a major hit with this leak,

35:39.011 --> 35:40.930
so it won't exactly
be glamorous,

35:40.972 --> 35:43.558
but it could get you
some really good press

35:43.599 --> 35:45.184
for this NordicStar competition.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.686
So...

35:46.727 --> 35:48.479
how do you feel about
designing the remaining looks

35:48.521 --> 35:49.772
for Janelle
and the rest of the cast?

35:49.814 --> 35:51.232
You would do that for me?

35:51.274 --> 35:52.984
Obviously,
you're incredibly talented.

35:53.025 --> 35:54.944
Mm.
It could be a big break.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.612
Deal.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.281
Thank you. (chuckles)

35:58.322 --> 35:59.740
All right. There's
no hidden cameras, right?

35:59.782 --> 36:00.867
Oh.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.170
♪ ♪

36:13.171 --> 36:16.382
(speaking Spanish)

36:25.308 --> 36:27.602
Daniel passed peacefully,

36:27.643 --> 36:29.020
and, um...

36:29.061 --> 36:31.689
my mom's at La Mirage, resting.

36:31.731 --> 36:34.192
I'm so sorry, Sam.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.613
Tonight was really hard.

36:39.739 --> 36:41.407
I can't even imagine.

36:45.369 --> 36:47.163
Um...

36:47.205 --> 36:49.457
(sighs)

36:49.498 --> 36:50.917
Thank you for what you did.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.710
I thought I'd be fine

36:52.752 --> 36:55.004
if Iris never came, but...

36:56.422 --> 36:59.133
(voice breaking):
But when I saw them together,

36:59.175 --> 37:00.259
I just...

37:02.303 --> 37:04.347
I saw my family
for the first time,

37:04.388 --> 37:05.973
and I'm so grateful.

37:06.974 --> 37:08.935
You deserved at least that.

37:11.354 --> 37:12.939
I'm sorry for
what I said to you.

37:12.980 --> 37:17.109
No, please, don't apologize.

37:17.151 --> 37:20.905
You'll take away
my moment of selflessness.
Okay.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.949
I'm not sorry.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.786
But I am.

37:26.827 --> 37:29.622
I know that
even if you're not around,

37:29.664 --> 37:31.582
you are always here for me.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.086
That's true,

37:35.127 --> 37:39.548
but it's no secret that
I can be selfish sometimes.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.759
And, um...

37:41.801 --> 37:44.303
I just want to thank you
for reminding me that...

37:44.345 --> 37:48.182
occasionally, there are things
going on in the world

37:48.224 --> 37:51.769
that are more important
than my life.

37:51.811 --> 37:55.356
And I'm just so happy
I got to do something for you,

37:55.398 --> 37:57.858
because I really love you
so much, Sam.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.778
And I love you, Fallon.

38:03.030 --> 38:05.032
Even if you're a little crazy.

38:05.074 --> 38:06.450
(chuckles)

38:06.492 --> 38:08.828
You didn't even see me dressed
as a nympho nun.

38:08.869 --> 38:10.788
Wow.

38:10.830 --> 38:12.623
You really would do
anything for me.

38:12.665 --> 38:14.083
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

38:16.585 --> 38:19.964
Alexis,
so glad you could stop by.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.008
Don't worry,
I won't be staying long.

38:22.049 --> 38:23.092
What's the occasion?

38:23.134 --> 38:24.468
Funny thing,

38:24.510 --> 38:25.970
Amanda somehow
knew about my past

38:26.012 --> 38:27.763
with that little
Australian wombat,

38:27.805 --> 38:30.391
and it seems that
it upset her very much.

38:30.433 --> 38:31.851
That is upsetting.

38:31.892 --> 38:33.102
Maybe Adam told her.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.021
Shut it,
you Swarovski knockoff.

38:35.062 --> 38:37.648
Well, he does like to be
the mama's boy.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.942
I spoke with Adam, and
he didn't say a word about it,

38:39.984 --> 38:42.361
which leaves you two,
the Macbeths.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.697
Still trying to poison Amanda
against me.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.991
Oh, please. You started it.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.201
Isn't it ironic
how worked up you get

38:49.243 --> 38:51.579
about somebody beating you
at your own game?

38:51.620 --> 38:53.289
The only thing
you will ever beat me at

38:53.331 --> 38:55.291
is dying first,
hopefully soon.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.209
I would like
to speak with Amanda

38:57.251 --> 38:59.295
and explain myself.
Where is she?

38:59.337 --> 39:00.421
Unfortunately,

39:00.463 --> 39:01.672
Amanda's resting.

39:01.714 --> 39:03.341
She's had a rough few days.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.343
Plus, she made it clear,

39:05.384 --> 39:06.510
she doesn't want to see you.

39:06.552 --> 39:09.055
That's because
the two of you have

39:09.096 --> 39:10.848
filled her mind with lies.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.267
Oh, we don't have to lie
about anything.

39:13.309 --> 39:16.395
You're so awful, you did
all the damage yourself.

39:16.437 --> 39:19.440
It's late, Alexis.
You should go.

39:19.482 --> 39:20.775
This isn't over.

39:21.442 --> 39:25.029
I know how much you like
to collect possessions,

39:25.071 --> 39:27.448
but Amanda is our daughter.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.492
It won't take her long
to figure out

39:29.533 --> 39:31.035
that she is your pawn.

39:31.077 --> 39:33.162
Just another pretty thing
to put on the shelf.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.706
Like this vase.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.047
Have a pleasant evening.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.970
Never imagined I'd say this,
but...

39:50.012 --> 39:52.473
it hasn't been terrible
working with you.

39:52.515 --> 39:53.015
ADAM:
Agreed.

39:53.015 --> 39:55.601
Let's do this again never.
(chuckles)

39:55.643 --> 39:57.770
Now, before I land myself
in federal prison

39:57.812 --> 39:59.605
thanks to your escapades,

39:59.647 --> 40:01.023
where are my crates of Bokocho?

40:02.566 --> 40:04.777
This key goes to
a refrigerated warehouse

40:04.819 --> 40:07.071
where I've been storing
your illegal imports.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.614
Finally.
I gave you my word.

40:08.656 --> 40:09.657
I posted the drug formula,

40:09.698 --> 40:11.158
anonymously.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.828
Now it's out there for anyone
to copy and reproduce.

40:13.869 --> 40:16.205
And if Plenexia tries
to take it down,

40:16.247 --> 40:17.498
they'll look even worse.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.500
Yeah, but are you sure
a pharmaceutical giant

40:19.542 --> 40:21.669
is really gonna be concerned
about their moral capital?

40:21.710 --> 40:23.003
Of course not,
but they are concerned

40:23.045 --> 40:24.422
with their financial capital.

40:24.463 --> 40:25.631
I tipped off a reporter
this morning.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.175
This is hitting
every major news outlet,

40:28.217 --> 40:30.428
and shareholders are spooked.

40:30.469 --> 40:32.513
Leaked formulas,
lax security.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.432
They're seeing huge losses.

40:34.473 --> 40:36.308
Wow. I got to admit,

40:36.350 --> 40:38.519
I wasn't sure
you'd be able to pull this off.

40:38.561 --> 40:41.397
I kind of thought this whole
Mission Impossible thing

40:41.439 --> 40:43.065
might have been Mars 2.0.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.817
(scoffs)
But it turns out

40:44.859 --> 40:46.569
you are just reckless.

40:46.610 --> 40:50.531
Well, I prefer to think of it
as controlled recklessness.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.495
You said we're even now, right?

40:58.956 --> 41:00.541
So please, don't call me again.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.668
Oh, I already deleted
your number. Yeah.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.006
(phone rings, vibrates)

41:07.047 --> 41:08.591
(sighs)

41:09.758 --> 41:10.801
(door closes)

41:12.386 --> 41:13.762
RICHARD:
Jeff Colby?

41:13.804 --> 41:15.723
Richard Payne, CEO of Plenexia.

41:15.764 --> 41:17.766
Sorry we didn't get to meet
last night.

41:17.808 --> 41:19.935
But as our stock started to drop
this morning,

41:19.977 --> 41:21.645
I put the pieces together.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.898
Your interview at my company,

41:23.939 --> 41:25.608
one of our top chemists
receiving an invitation

41:25.649 --> 41:28.235
to the Alexam launch party,
and, of course,

41:28.277 --> 41:29.778
last night's break-in.

41:29.820 --> 41:32.156
So I had a chat
with our chemist.

41:32.198 --> 41:35.951
She was much more forthcoming
once I took out my checkbook.

41:35.993 --> 41:39.455
I know you stole
my drug formula.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.665
I also know you're too smart
for me to prove anything.

41:41.707 --> 41:44.502
So don't worry,
I'm not going to the police.

41:44.543 --> 41:47.922
If you want to play games,
I'm all in.

41:47.963 --> 41:49.507
But watch yourself,

41:49.548 --> 41:51.425
because you're gonna pay.

41:51.467 --> 41:52.927
Good night, Mr. Colby.
