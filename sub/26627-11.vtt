What the hell did you do?

01:54.906 --> 01:55.949
Get over there.

01:56.574 --> 01:59.410
You need to assume command of the scene
from the NYPD.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.288
Daredevil is a federal fugitive.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.711

Lock down the entire area.

We cannot let them escape.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.175
God damn it, I asked you a question.
What have you done?

02:15.593 --> 02:16.719
It's not done.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.472
We are not done.

02:25.728 --> 02:26.729
[breathing shakily] Matt?

02:26.813 --> 02:29.732
Matt, come on, you gotta get up.
You gotta get up. Please wake up.

We gotta go.

I know. I know.
I'm sorry, but you gotta run.

-Cops are outside. You have to go now.
-We have to run.

02:54.424 --> 02:57.302
No. No, Matt, I'm gonna stay here,
and I'll tell the police everything.

02:57.385 --> 03:01.681
Karen, the man in my suit,
his name is Ben Poindexter.

03:01.764 --> 03:04.100
He's an FBI agent. He works for Fisk.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.352
So does Agent Nadeem.

[theme music playing]

04:20.426 --> 04:22.595

04:22.679 --> 04:23.763
He killed him.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.516
-Who?
-Daredevil.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.351
He killed Father Lantom. Who's in command here?

04:37.860 --> 04:40.697
I am. Captain Strieber, 15th Precinct.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.826
Nadeem, FBI.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.453
Daredevil is our suspect.
I'm assuming command.

04:48.329 --> 04:49.831
The suspect is still at large.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.499
We have civilians down on the inside,

04:51.582 --> 04:53.584
the church and surrounding buildings
are on lockdown.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.336
How far out is ESU?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.629
[Maggie] Excuse me?

04:57.505 --> 05:00.258
I saw Daredevil leaving the church.

05:01.676 --> 05:02.593
When?

05:03.344 --> 05:05.096
Moments before you all arrived.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.764
He headed that way. Well, that lines up.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.643
We have two additional DOA's
in an alley a block from here.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.730
I'm aware of that.
Daredevil came back to the church.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.607
I saw him myself.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.610
[Ray] We're looking for three suspects.

05:19.694 --> 05:24.866
Daredevil and his two accomplices,
and a white female. Blonde, 5'9''.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.160

I'm so sorry.

05:55.813 --> 05:56.939
Why didn't you run?

05:57.815 --> 05:58.900
Run? How could I run?

05:58.983 --> 06:01.944

all of this was for nothing.

Fall back.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.702
[breathing heavily]

06:12.497 --> 06:15.249
It won't hold them forever.
They'll be back.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.379
Matt, you're right.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.506
You're right, it's my fault.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.842
I deserved the baton, not Father Lantom.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.219
I should never have come here.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.679
Why did you come?

06:30.306 --> 06:32.016
Because Fisk knows who you are.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.352
I wanted to warn you.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.812
That's what this is about?

06:36.521 --> 06:38.981
Yeah. He already knew that.

06:39.065 --> 06:42.485
Oh, God. Karen, I had him.
[exhales sharply]

06:42.568 --> 06:45.530
I just gave up my one shot
to come here to save you.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.742
What do you mean, you had him?

06:50.535 --> 06:51.953
I was in his penthouse.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.205
Waiting for him.

06:55.373 --> 06:56.457
That was it.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.794
It was... [sighs]

06:59.877 --> 07:01.129
...the moment.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.299
What do you think you were gonna do?

and he's with Nadeem.

07:20.356 --> 07:21.357
[Dex] Stay frosty.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.651
They're still in here somewhere.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.990
What are you gonna do when you get him?

07:35.955 --> 07:38.082
I did not sign up for this shit.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.959
Yes, you did.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.879
[ESU leader] All clear!
This room is secure.

Please wait here.

Eternal Father, I beg you...

08:16.412 --> 08:19.165
welcome Paul into your holy embrace...

08:20.249 --> 08:24.420
and do not punish him
for my stupid decisions,

08:25.004 --> 08:30.801
for my weakness, my sin,
and for what I have brought unto us all.

08:32.637 --> 08:36.182
Sister, we need access
to every area of the church grounds.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.266
Now.

08:38.726 --> 08:39.977
I'm sorry, Sister.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.065
I know you're in mourning,
but we need your help.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.621
I'm sorry.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.335
[sighs] Oh, Lord.

-[officer 1] Clear!
-[officer 2] Clear!

09:22.728 --> 09:24.105
-Shit.
-[officer 3] Clear!

09:44.584 --> 09:45.835
What about the rectory?

09:46.627 --> 09:49.422
There's also a door to the roof.
It's that way.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.382
Let me show you.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.305
Okay. They're gone.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.036
[panting]

10:44.060 --> 10:45.436
All right. They're gone.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.569
I guess we'll just wait here until...

10:55.279 --> 10:56.447
until they leave.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.870
Why is Fisk hunting you?

11:04.789 --> 11:05.956
Had a plan.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.292
Went to go see him.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.670
You went to see Fisk?

11:10.753 --> 11:13.881
Yeah, I thought maybe I could provoke him,

11:15.132 --> 11:17.093
turn his emotions against him.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.636
To what end?

11:20.221 --> 11:22.640
Make him attack me in front of the FBI.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.601
Jesus, Karen.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.228
Yeah.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.941
Don't worry, it didn't work. He...

11:33.150 --> 11:36.529
caught me off guard, asked me
how long I'd known your secret.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.950
I swear I tried, but he just...

11:41.534 --> 11:42.910
He read it in my face.

11:44.370 --> 11:49.291
You tried to outsmart Fisk?
Provoke him into making a mistake?

11:49.375 --> 11:52.795
[sighs] Fine, okay, right. You're right.
I was an idiot. Sorry.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.675
No, you were brave.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.348
Anyway, he didn't take the bait.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.308
What was the bait?

12:09.812 --> 12:11.689
I told him a secret of my own.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.279
[sighs]

12:19.363 --> 12:20.573
[scoffs]

12:25.494 --> 12:27.997
You remember that friend he had
that got shot?

12:28.956 --> 12:29.957
Uh...

12:30.708 --> 12:31.959
Wesley?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.006
I killed him.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.010
That's why he sent Poindexter after me.

12:42.261 --> 12:46.015
[sighs] I was stupid and...
[sniffles] and reckless,

12:46.098 --> 12:48.726
and now Father Lantom
is dead because of it.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.269
Because of... because of me.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.605
Why didn't you tell me?

12:53.439 --> 12:54.523
[sniffling]

12:55.274 --> 12:57.067
[sighs] I don't know. You...

12:58.152 --> 12:59.236
[chuckles softly]

13:00.654 --> 13:04.408
You always, uh, treated me like I was...

13:06.243 --> 13:07.369
innocent.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.542
That was nice... It was nice
that you thought of me like that.

13:19.673 --> 13:22.218
[sighs] What were you gonna do to Fisk?

13:23.677 --> 13:24.678
Kill him.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.267
-Your turn to judge me.
-No.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.436
No, I'm not. I get it.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.104
Trust me.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.068
Just makes me, uh...

13:40.986 --> 13:43.322
It makes me sad for you.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.908
It has to be done, Karen.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.786
Okay, you're gonna
have to listen to me here.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.330
Okay, listen to me.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.707
[sighs]

13:54.583 --> 13:56.585
Okay, I never told you
why I left Vermont, right?

13:56.669 --> 13:57.837
Why I left home.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.425
Okay, see, there was a car crash.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.845
And...

14:06.428 --> 14:10.975
Um, I killed my brother, uh,
because I was... I was high

14:11.058 --> 14:12.977
-and I was drunk and I was angry...
-Jesus, Karen.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.604
...and I shouldn't have been driving,
and it changed everything.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.939
[breathing shakily]

14:17.940 --> 14:20.317
No matter what I do...

14:21.652 --> 14:24.905
there is no atoning for that.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.158
Okay? There is no way
to come back from it.

14:28.242 --> 14:32.246
What if... it is the way back?

14:33.038 --> 14:34.123
For me?

14:36.584 --> 14:38.961
I can't let Fisk go.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.303
Killing anyone...

14:48.721 --> 14:49.972
even Fisk...

14:54.476 --> 14:56.937
it will change everything that you...

14:58.439 --> 15:00.274
that you feel about yourself.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.323
[elevator dings]

15:25.716 --> 15:27.551
[protesters booing]

15:35.684 --> 15:37.436
[Donovan] For the past two years,

15:37.519 --> 15:40.856
ever since his unjust conviction
on racketeering charges,

15:40.940 --> 15:45.694
our client has maintained his innocence
and fought to clear his good name.

15:46.820 --> 15:50.074
One hour ago,
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals

15:50.157 --> 15:52.826
overturned the conviction of Wilson Fisk.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.537
Having seen the proof
that they were wrong,

15:55.621 --> 16:00.501
the Department of Justice will not be
going forward with charges.

16:01.669 --> 16:07.383
As of tonight, we are proud to announce
that justice has prevailed

16:08.050 --> 16:11.720
and Wilson Fisk is once again a free man.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.222
[protesters booing]

16:21.355 --> 16:24.817
I know that most of you
find this difficult to accept.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.863
That's only because
you've been manipulated...

16:30.864 --> 16:34.535
poisoned into believing
the news media's fake story...

16:35.119 --> 16:36.328
that I am evil,

16:36.996 --> 16:38.789
that I am a criminal.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.710
Quite the opposite is true.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.213
Because I challenge the system...

16:47.256 --> 16:52.261
because I've told the truth and tried
to make this city a better place,

16:52.845 --> 16:55.681
the people in power
decided to tear me down...

16:57.516 --> 17:00.394
to tear me down with false allegations.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.440
They sent someone to frame me.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.524
Daredevil.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.445
The killer who's now showing
his true colors,

17:09.528 --> 17:15.075
who has tried to murder people
in newspaper offices and churches...

17:16.368 --> 17:18.871
attacking our sacred institutions.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.874
Believe me.

17:23.792 --> 17:27.713
Daredevil is our true public enemy.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.893
[Brett] Agent Nadeem?

17:41.518 --> 17:42.770
Detective Mahoney.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.939
I'm taking over the murder investigation
on our side.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.985
Great. We'll share what we've got ASAP.
I promise.

17:50.527 --> 17:54.823
Thanks. But between you and me,
there's something off about all of this.

17:56.867 --> 17:57.868
What's that?

17:58.452 --> 18:02.206
Well, a number of witnesses claim
Daredevil was trying to kill Karen Page.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.709
And your people are making her out
to be his accomplice.

18:06.710 --> 18:09.755
There's more to this story
than you're aware of, Detective.

18:10.631 --> 18:14.009
Thanks for bringing it to my attention,
but this is our crime scene.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.345
We'll let you know if we need anything.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.320
[Arinori] Dex, this is getting
out of control.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.988
Someone needs to call Kingpin.

18:36.657 --> 18:37.658
Dex?

18:38.325 --> 18:39.451
Hello?

18:40.035 --> 18:41.870
Yeah? [panting]

18:42.454 --> 18:43.455
What?

18:44.706 --> 18:46.792
I'm saying we should get in front of this.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.252
Someone needs to call Kingpin.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.129
And say what?

18:50.671 --> 18:51.713
That we failed?

18:52.422 --> 18:53.340
"We"?

18:53.924 --> 18:55.968
There something that you want
to say to me, Arinori?

18:56.051 --> 18:58.762
Hey, this isn't helping.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.684
Dex, they're in the wind.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.603
And we're not gonna find 'em tonight.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.399
I'm gonna release the ESU
and open the scene to forensics.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.234
No. No way.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.487
You get the NYPD to go
to every house in the neighborhood.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.156
Door to door.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.867
We do not stop until we find them.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.119
Dex, they're gone.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.456
Fine, call it off.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.542
And you call Kingpin

19:28.625 --> 19:31.628
and tell him you're the reason
that Karen Page is still breathing,

19:31.712 --> 19:32.921
that you gave up.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.844
Okay. A few more hours.

19:50.314 --> 19:53.942
Sister, do you mind
if I ask you a couple of questions?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.488
Do you know the suspects?

19:59.531 --> 20:03.660
As far as I'm aware, the only one
you've identified by name is Karen Page.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.288
And, yes, she and I are acquainted.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.707
Do you know where she might have gone?

20:10.083 --> 20:13.295
I thought you believed the suspects
were still hiding in the church.

20:15.297 --> 20:19.927
We do. I do.
I meant where on the church grounds.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.805
May I ask you a personal question,
Agent Nadeem?

20:25.015 --> 20:26.058
Okay.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.311
Do you consider yourself a moral person?

20:31.063 --> 20:32.439
I like to think so.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.317
I try to be.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.029
My good friend died here tonight,

20:39.696 --> 20:42.199
protecting Karen Page from evil.

20:46.495 --> 20:51.500
If you're the kind of man you claim to be,
do you really want to help it find her?

21:08.475 --> 21:09.476
Thank you.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.109
What? What is it?

21:21.321 --> 21:22.739
[footsteps approaching]

21:25.284 --> 21:26.451
[sighs]

21:27.703 --> 21:28.996
Thank God.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.416
It's not safe for you to come out yet.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.919
Yeah, we know. I can hear 'em.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.426
I can come back with food,

21:42.509 --> 21:45.262
but in the meantime,
you should get cleaned up.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.848
We have fresh clothes.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.350
Donations for the poor.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.104
Uh, thank you.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.569
Uh, Sister...

22:03.071 --> 22:05.949
for what it's worth, I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have come here.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.160
This is not your fault.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.369
[scoffs]

22:10.078 --> 22:11.788
Father Lantom didn't deserve this.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.875
Few of us get what we deserve.

22:17.544 --> 22:18.920
These should fit you.

22:30.057 --> 22:33.226
I'll come back as soon as I can.
You'll be safe here.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.103
No, we won't.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.358
They brought in search dogs.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.236
[Dex] Search over here.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.529
[officer] Track. Track.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.619
Not me, fellas. The bad guys.

22:51.661 --> 22:52.662
All right.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.086
[Maggie] Wait.

22:59.628 --> 23:00.837
Tell them what you saw.

23:00.921 --> 23:03.173
-[nun] The man in black is next door.
-What?

23:03.256 --> 23:05.926
I saw him go in, slam the door.
It was him--

23:06.009 --> 23:07.928
-[Dex] Where?
-The orphanage.

23:08.011 --> 23:10.263
Please tell me
we got all the kids out of there.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.264
I don't know.

23:11.348 --> 23:12.933
Come on, let's move.

23:19.731 --> 23:20.732
Yeah.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.818
They're taking the dogs next door.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.945
-[sighs]
-Buys us some time.

23:32.619 --> 23:33.787
[groans softly]

23:34.788 --> 23:36.039
Jesus, Matt.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.882
Couldn't put it on in front of her?

23:47.592 --> 23:49.761
You know, something just kinda hit me.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.558
Watching you...
wall yourself off from her.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.185
You know?

23:59.688 --> 24:01.731
Uh, yeah. She told me.

24:03.191 --> 24:04.025
[scoffs]

24:04.109 --> 24:06.862
Said she felt ashamed about what she did.

24:07.821 --> 24:12.701
And that... everyone
you ever cared about left you.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.286
-Can we not do this now?
-Is that why you

24:14.369 --> 24:16.371
-insist on doing everything alone?
-I don't insist--

24:16.455 --> 24:18.081
-Pushing Foggy and me away.
-I'm not.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.666
I told you, I'm tryin' to protect you--

24:19.749 --> 24:21.626
I think you're trying to protect yourself.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.420
You wanna talk about this right now?

24:23.503 --> 24:25.505
There are people tryin' to kill us,
and you wanna--

24:25.589 --> 24:27.507
Just shut up for a second, Matt, okay?

24:28.300 --> 24:30.969
Look, I was never gonna leave you
up there, and I'm not leaving you now.

24:31.553 --> 24:32.888
Neither will Foggy.

24:33.555 --> 24:36.183
Despite the fact that you've been
a complete asshole to him,

24:36.266 --> 24:38.226
he'd still follow you over a cliff.

24:38.768 --> 24:40.770
[helicopter in distance]

24:41.563 --> 24:42.397
Yeah.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.651
Okay. So, what, you agree?

24:47.235 --> 24:48.445
That could actually work.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.657
I don't get it. What could work?

24:56.286 --> 24:57.329
Foggy.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.959
Mr. Fisk's people said you had to call
a press conference and read it.

25:03.627 --> 25:04.628
Jesus.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.047
You're calling him "Mr. Fisk" now?

25:10.717 --> 25:12.093
"I was acting under duress

25:12.177 --> 25:16.223
when I falsely and publicly accused
Wilson Fisk of criminal activities.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.727
Daredevil threatened
the lives of my family,

25:20.810 --> 25:24.981
but in light of recent events,
I now see that I did the wrong thing,

25:25.065 --> 25:27.234
that I must stand up for what's right."

25:27.317 --> 25:29.277
-I can't say this.
-You have to.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.695
It's complete bullshit.

25:31.279 --> 25:32.864
You know what's bullshit, Foggy?

25:32.948 --> 25:36.243
The fact that me and Mom and Dad
are caught up in this in the first place.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.745
The only reason these people tricked us
into that bank loan--

25:38.828 --> 25:40.956
You knew it was fraud
when you signed it.

25:41.456 --> 25:45.919
Okay, yeah. But it only happened
because Fisk wanted to get to you.

25:46.503 --> 25:49.714
Everything that's happened,
the suppliers cuttin' us off, the loan,

25:49.798 --> 25:53.218
all that shit happened because you wanted
to be the big-time lawyer

25:53.301 --> 25:55.262
instead of hangin' around here
with us losers.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.764
Come on. That's not fair.

25:57.847 --> 26:01.017
No, it's not. None of it is.

26:01.893 --> 26:03.979
We didn't have any say in this, Foggy.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.690
You went and pissed off
the biggest mob boss in the city,

26:06.773 --> 26:08.066
but we're the ones paying for it.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.277
Or we will if you don't do what he says.

26:11.653 --> 26:16.491
If I read that statement to the press,
Fisk wins, Theo.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.660
He's already won, Fogg.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.537
Now, do the right thing. The right thing for your family.

26:26.334 --> 26:27.961
[cell phone vibrating]

26:32.007 --> 26:33.008
Hello? Matt?

26:37.137 --> 26:41.099
The deputy AG has ruled that you
continue to be a valuable DOJ asset

26:41.182 --> 26:43.184
who deserves ongoing protection.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.813
Because they're terrified
of the PR hit if you get killed.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.441
Thank you, Agent Hattley.

26:50.483 --> 26:51.735
That will be all.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.035
Well, where is Vanessa?

27:00.118 --> 27:03.371
[Donovan] In the air.
Her plane took off an hour ago.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.292
Then there's only one thing
left for me to do,

27:07.375 --> 27:09.252
which, apparently, I have to do myself.

27:09.336 --> 27:12.756
We doubled the offer, threw in incentives,
but the owner wouldn't sell.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.466
Not at any price.

27:14.549 --> 27:16.426
Then I'll visit her in person.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.387
I'll make a more compelling offer.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.314
[officer 1] All the way up
to the rectory, right?

27:29.397 --> 27:30.774
[officer 2] That's what they said.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.245
Sorry, sir, this is an active...

27:44.996 --> 27:46.539
Hey, are you Foggy Nelson?

27:46.623 --> 27:48.833
Guilty as charged, Officer...

27:48.917 --> 27:51.252
-"Minelli."
-It's an honor to meet you.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.506
I signed our union's endorsement letter.
I hope you kick Blake Tower's ass.

27:54.589 --> 27:57.217
With people like you backing me up,
how could I not?

27:57.300 --> 28:01.554
Hey, listen, I'm here to talk to
Detective Mahoney. You think you could...

28:06.017 --> 28:08.019
[sirens wailing in distance]

28:11.815 --> 28:12.899
[officer] Move!

28:22.242 --> 28:23.243
Nelson?

28:24.494 --> 28:25.704
What the hell are you doing?

28:25.787 --> 28:27.872
Agent Nadeem, pleasure to see you again.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.958
I asked you a question.
What are you doing here?

28:30.542 --> 28:35.755
You know, just observing the hard work
of our men and women in blue.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.049
That's some weak bullshitting.
You wanna try that again?

28:38.133 --> 28:39.926
Okay. You caught me.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.887
Truth is, I'm killing time.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.599
Killing time for what?

28:50.228 --> 28:51.688
Why do you keep looking at her?

28:51.771 --> 28:53.857
Because I need to kill a few more seconds.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.236
Okay, I'm good.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.238
Agent Nadeem, I'm here for my client.

29:00.822 --> 29:01.990
-Your--
-Client.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.370
Don't shoot! She's unarmed.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.956
[Foggy] This is why I'm here.
To surrender my client.

29:11.207 --> 29:12.041
Good.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.502
To the NYPD.

29:15.086 --> 29:18.298
Karen Page, you are under arrest.

29:18.882 --> 29:19.883
Cuff her.

29:22.051 --> 29:23.762
What the hell are you doing?

29:23.845 --> 29:24.929
She's ours, Detective.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.181
Like hell.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.640
[Ray] She's a federal suspect.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.517
She's a suspected accomplice to murder.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.643
That's state law.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.729
And she's here to surrender to the NYPD.

29:32.812 --> 29:33.646
Shut up.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.190
I'm saying,
as the only attorney here,

29:35.273 --> 29:37.150
-I could help clear--
-Put a sock in it, Nelson.

29:37.233 --> 29:39.903
These feds know the law.
She's our suspect.

29:39.986 --> 29:42.030
They can file a writ
and maybe talk to her later.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.367
I will not let you take her.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.827
[Brett] You and what army?

29:48.369 --> 29:51.247
Hey, we're on the same team here.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.794
Detective, a word?

29:57.086 --> 30:00.131
What part of "our crime scene"
do you not understand?

30:00.215 --> 30:02.550
Ben, we're all cut up
about what happened here.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.638
A word. Please.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.315
You need to stand your people down.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.859
Listen to me very carefully.

30:21.069 --> 30:25.031
If we take Karen Page into custody,
she'll be dead before she reaches HQ.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.282
No, don't react.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.868
Just get her the hell away from us.
We clear?

30:29.911 --> 30:30.912
Crystal.

30:33.289 --> 30:35.750
Detective Mahoney
will take custody of the suspect.

30:35.834 --> 30:36.876
Bullshit!

30:36.960 --> 30:39.170
We'll have her back in an hour.
Hattley will pull strings.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.129
No.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.257
You can't kill her here anyway.

30:45.718 --> 30:47.011
You messed up, Ray.

30:47.512 --> 30:51.140
You really... really messed up.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.298
Mrs. Falb. My name is--

31:23.381 --> 31:24.716
I know who you are.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.176
Take off your shoes.

31:34.767 --> 31:35.852
It's beautiful.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.021
[Falb] It certainly is.

31:38.104 --> 31:39.856
[Fisk] It's peaceful and so--

31:39.939 --> 31:43.359
[Falb] It's been through quite a bit
over the years.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.905
But it's home now.

31:50.950 --> 31:56.664
I hope you're not here
to offer me more money for it.

31:57.206 --> 32:00.251
-Would it change your mind?
-It would not.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.048
I understand
you became aware of the painting

32:05.131 --> 32:08.259
when it was taken away from me
by the government.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.427
Yes.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.263
Ironic, I suppose.

32:13.556 --> 32:18.686
It was a government
that took it from my family in 1943.

32:19.270 --> 32:22.815
So, then, you are particularly suited
to understanding my situation.

32:23.858 --> 32:26.653
The painting was given to me
by the woman that I love.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.030
When I'm with it, I am with her.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.032
She must be an amazing woman.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.617
Yes.

32:33.743 --> 32:38.122
Yeah, she's given me much
in the short time I've had with her.

32:38.706 --> 32:42.669
She brought focus to my life.
Love, if you will.

32:42.752 --> 32:45.713
This painting is bound up in that love.

32:47.006 --> 32:49.676
It's part of me. It's part of us.

32:50.802 --> 32:55.264
My years on this earth...
have taught me...

32:56.307 --> 32:58.935
there is nothing more important than love.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.064
I didn't have much of it.

33:04.649 --> 33:09.237
And when it was offered to me,
I was too afraid to accept it.

33:10.113 --> 33:11.531
I understand.

33:13.157 --> 33:16.202
Well, then, you will understand me
when I say this:

33:17.370 --> 33:20.915
that painting was not hers to give.

33:21.624 --> 33:23.668
She was unaware of the provenance.

33:24.210 --> 33:25.712
She gave it with love.

33:25.795 --> 33:30.008
It was not taken with love.

33:30.842 --> 33:34.262
I was a toddler
when the wolves came to our door.

33:35.471 --> 33:38.099
The gestapo demanded everything we had.

33:39.058 --> 33:40.935
Including that painting. My father fought them...

33:44.022 --> 33:45.106
[sighs]

33:45.648 --> 33:47.817
...and they shot him in front of us.

33:48.401 --> 33:55.199
Do you know what it's like
to see your father take his last breath

33:55.742 --> 33:58.578
on the floor in front of you?

34:00.872 --> 34:04.125
As they marched my family
across Poland to the ghetto...

34:07.420 --> 34:12.091
my mother went hungry to feed us.

34:14.677 --> 34:19.682
But of the seven members of my family,
we were the only ones who survived.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.852
I am deeply sorry
for everything you've suffered.

34:24.604 --> 34:31.569
This painting is my connection
to the people I love.

34:34.405 --> 34:37.200
I know who you are, Mr. Fisk.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.702
You are a wolf, too.

34:40.620 --> 34:47.043
Men like you took away my family,
took my ability to love...

34:49.212 --> 34:51.631
and almost took my life.

34:54.050 --> 34:57.845
You will take nothing more.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.642
You have been through so very much.

35:11.526 --> 35:14.278
Vanessa would want you
to keep the painting.

35:16.572 --> 35:18.699
Is that supposed to matter to me?

35:19.909 --> 35:20.910
No.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.834
But it matters to me.

36:21.512 --> 36:23.306
[officer 1] What kind of psycho
kills a priest?

36:23.389 --> 36:25.141
[officer 2] This makes me sick.

36:47.663 --> 36:50.499
[screaming]

36:51.209 --> 36:53.211
[panting]

37:58.317 --> 37:59.819
[Brett] Come on out of there.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.326
[scoffs]

38:07.410 --> 38:10.204
The FBI is going to freak
when they find out you let us go.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.498
Yeah, well,
they can kiss my police-blue ass.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.376
Seriously, are you gonna be okay?

38:16.836 --> 38:20.840
I had to see it with my own eyes.
Fisk really has turned the goddamn feds.

38:21.507 --> 38:24.135
-Some of them.
-Can't believe no one saw it coming.

38:24.218 --> 38:26.012
Well, actually, some of us did.

38:26.554 --> 38:27.555
Yeah, that's true.

38:27.638 --> 38:30.016
Nice takedown on Blake Tower, by the way.

38:30.099 --> 38:32.351
I posted the video on my profile page.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.437
Brett, I'm flattered.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.731
Even if he did crush your ass at the end.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.357
He didn't crush my ass.

38:38.441 --> 38:40.067
You ran out of there
like a scared little--

38:40.151 --> 38:43.070
-[scoffs] Nah, uh... it's my fault.
-Yeah, whatever.

38:43.154 --> 38:45.656
You guys aren't alone in this,
you understand?

38:45.740 --> 38:48.200
Fisk put a lot of my brothers and sisters
in the ground,

38:48.284 --> 38:49.869
and none of us have forgotten that.

38:50.453 --> 38:53.164
If you can find a way
to bring down that son of a bitch,

38:53.247 --> 38:55.541
every cop in the city
is gonna have your back.

38:55.624 --> 38:56.834
Thanks, Brett.

38:57.376 --> 38:58.502
Take care of yourself.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.968
Okay, so how do we play this?

39:06.052 --> 39:08.888
Simple. We convince Matt
to take his head out of his ass.

39:08.971 --> 39:09.847
[Karen sighs]

39:14.310 --> 39:16.562
So it looks like you needed
my help after all.

39:19.815 --> 39:20.816
Yeah.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.819
Yeah, I did, Foggy. You're right.

39:25.321 --> 39:28.032
Do you have any idea how much
life has sucked for Karen and me

39:28.115 --> 39:29.992
while you were off doin' your own thing?

39:30.076 --> 39:31.827
No, but I'm sorry, Foggy.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.830
Maybe I was wrong to... to push you away.

39:34.914 --> 39:39.085
Okay, it's insanely hard to fight with you
if you keep agreeing with me.

39:39.168 --> 39:40.961
Good, 'cause I don't wanna fight with you.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.633
Look, the way I've treated you,
the way I've treated you both...

39:46.759 --> 39:48.386
You've deserved better.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.472
Yes, we did.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.890
Yes, you did.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.980
[sighs] Okay, so where do we go from here?

40:00.064 --> 40:01.357
I don't want to leave you,

40:01.440 --> 40:04.235
but I can't ask you to be accomplices
to what I have to do now.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.822
[stammers] What does that mean?

40:09.031 --> 40:10.032
Um...

40:10.574 --> 40:13.077
It means that, uh, Matt's gonna kill Fisk.

40:14.203 --> 40:17.081
That building falling on you
really did mess up your head.

40:17.164 --> 40:19.125
We put him in prison, Foggy.
Look what happened.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.210
It's not gonna be the same this time.

40:21.293 --> 40:23.129
They're gonna throw him
in some supermax hole...

40:23.212 --> 40:25.047
-Come on.
-...where he can't compromise anybody.

40:25.131 --> 40:28.843
-I know you're not that naive.
-It's called having faith in the system.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.178
Something you used to have.

40:31.262 --> 40:34.390
It's called facing the reality
that some people are so rich and powerful,

40:34.473 --> 40:36.642
the system simply can't handle them,

40:36.725 --> 40:38.769
that they actually are above the law.

40:38.853 --> 40:41.772
That's the bullshit that people like Fisk
want you to believe.

40:42.314 --> 40:44.024
Nobody's above the law.

40:44.567 --> 40:48.863
The only thing powerful enough
to take down scumbags like him is the law.

40:48.946 --> 40:52.241
He's twisted it into something
that actually protects him.

40:52.324 --> 40:53.617
Federal law, maybe,

40:53.701 --> 40:57.538
but we can build a state case
that even Blake Tower can't deny,

40:57.621 --> 40:59.707
force him to take it to the grand jury.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.750
Fisk has been five steps ahead of us
at every turn.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.836
You really think
he's gonna allow that to happen?

41:03.919 --> 41:07.173
Hey, you're right. You're right.
Maybe just hear him out.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.758
Fine. [chuckles] I'm telling you,
it's not gonna work.

41:09.842 --> 41:13.179
You want to give the law another try,
sure, I'm all ears.

41:14.388 --> 41:15.514
Simple.

41:15.598 --> 41:18.434
Step one, we work together.

41:19.185 --> 41:24.607
Step two, we come up with a plan.
And step three, we execute that plan.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.568
That's genius.
Come up with that by yourself?

41:28.152 --> 41:29.820
So I'm still working out the details.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.530
[Karen sighs] What about this?

41:31.614 --> 41:33.657
What about we find ourselves
another witness?

41:34.825 --> 41:36.243
Someone who will flip on Fisk.

41:36.327 --> 41:39.079
But unlike Jasper Evans,
we keep 'em alive this time.

41:39.622 --> 41:42.666
Someone who knows the details
of Fisk's criminal operation...

41:43.667 --> 41:44.919
who has nothing to lose.

41:45.002 --> 41:45.836
-Okay?
-[sighs]

41:46.962 --> 41:47.963
No.

41:49.715 --> 41:52.593
No, we find someone
who has everything to lose.

42:01.227 --> 42:02.228
[Wellers] Copy that.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.524
Karen Page has been found.

42:07.858 --> 42:09.735
NYPD took her into custody.

42:10.319 --> 42:13.030
The police? How?

42:13.572 --> 42:15.491
It was Agent Nadeem's call.

42:15.574 --> 42:16.659
[sighs]

42:19.620 --> 42:21.038
Your jacket.

42:22.706 --> 42:25.167
-Sir?
-Give me your jacket.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.772
[bones crunching]

42:54.238 --> 42:55.656
[breathing heavily]

43:00.244 --> 43:01.370
Pull over.

43:02.538 --> 43:03.747
Get rid of the body.

43:04.707 --> 43:05.749
Yes, sir.

43:32.818 --> 43:34.987
Seema! Are you here?

43:39.658 --> 43:40.784
What's the matter?

43:41.619 --> 43:42.620
-[panting]
-Dad?

43:42.703 --> 43:44.705
It's okay. It's okay, Sami.

43:44.788 --> 43:46.874
I saw the broken vase, and I got worried.

43:46.957 --> 43:49.543
Dad, sorry. I knocked it over.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.670
Mom said she was gonna clean it up later.

43:51.754 --> 43:52.796
Are you mad?

43:52.880 --> 43:54.757
No. No, of course not.

43:55.382 --> 43:57.676
-We have to pack. Now.
-What's the...

43:57.760 --> 43:59.637
Just for a few days, okay?

43:59.720 --> 44:01.764
I have to work.
I want you to go away, okay?

44:01.847 --> 44:04.892
Someplace fun. Like Disney World. Yeah?

44:05.809 --> 44:07.561
But it has to be right this minute.

44:08.312 --> 44:11.690
It's okay, Sami. It'll... It'll be fine.

44:12.232 --> 44:14.943
-We can pack together. Come on.
-Go. Go, go, go, go. -What's going on?
-I'll explain everything when you're safe.

44:21.867 --> 44:24.870
-You're scaring me.
-Be scared later. Now, just hurry.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.031
[whispering] Stop. This way.

45:10.165 --> 45:11.041
[door rattles]

45:11.625 --> 45:12.626
Get back.

45:13.961 --> 45:15.170
The sliders.

45:16.213 --> 45:17.214
-[gunshot]
-[Seema shrieks]

45:17.297 --> 45:19.717
Take Sami into the bathroom
and lie down in the tub.

45:19.800 --> 45:20.801
Now!

45:23.387 --> 45:25.848
[heartbeat thumping]

45:38.068 --> 45:39.403
[gunshots]

45:46.452 --> 45:47.953
[panting]

45:58.255 --> 45:59.089
[grunts]

46:03.218 --> 46:04.386
[groaning]

46:30.746 --> 46:33.123
[heartbeat thumping]

46:38.629 --> 46:39.588
[gun clicks]

46:43.634 --> 46:44.718
[groans]

46:44.802 --> 46:46.011
[panting]

46:58.440 --> 47:00.567
Obviously, I'm here to help you.

47:02.027 --> 47:03.779
I sold you out to Fisk.

47:04.321 --> 47:06.198
I know you didn't want to.

47:06.281 --> 47:07.449
But I did.

47:08.450 --> 47:11.245
So maybe you're here
because you wanna be the one that kills me

47:11.328 --> 47:12.871
before Fisk gets around to it.

47:12.955 --> 47:15.249
If we're gonna get your family
someplace safe,

47:15.332 --> 47:16.667
you're gonna have to trust me.

47:17.251 --> 47:18.585
I can't trust anybody.

47:19.419 --> 47:20.712
Well, I trust you.

47:23.048 --> 47:25.050
You saved Karen Page's life tonight.

47:32.724 --> 47:34.101
So I owe you one.
