Oh, no, peter, I'm not mad.

I'm horny. Hornier than
I've been in a long time.

Now, get those pants off,

Perfectly separated popcorn,
anyone?

19:16.281 --> 19:18.030
This is good.
Where'd you get it?

19:18.158 --> 19:20.158
An elder abuse victim
sent it to the station

As a thank-you
for arresting her grandson.

Is stewie still sleeping?

Probably. He was up
pretty late last night.
