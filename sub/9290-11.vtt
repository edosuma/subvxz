00:12.200 --> 00:14.471
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.567 --> 00:17.415
You know me well enough not to be
surprised if there are repercussions.

00:17.511 --> 00:20.071
I hope you're not threatening me.

00:20.167 --> 00:22.534
I don't make threats, David,
just tell it like it is.

00:22.630 --> 00:25.286
What he's doing is showing you that
not only did he have the power...

00:25.382 --> 00:28.933
to help start your political career,
but he also has the power to put an end to it.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.853
There has to be a way
to get to him.

00:30.949 --> 00:32.964
David, what...
what's wrong?

00:33.060 --> 00:34.724
I need your help.

00:34.820 --> 00:37.603
Hector and Ramon are trying
to buy a virus to use as a weapon.

00:37.699 --> 00:39.746
Millions of people could die.
I set up this deal...

00:39.842 --> 00:42.530
so my government could take control
of the virus and destroy it.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.569
- You're still with C.T.U?
- Yes, I'm still with C.T.U.

00:45.665 --> 00:48.289
I cannot allow this virus
to get into the wrong hands.

00:48.385 --> 00:51.713
I have a message from Jack.
The virus they're going to buy...

00:51.841 --> 00:54.688
Jack is going
to take it from them.

00:54.784 --> 00:58.144
Jack promised to get me and my family
out of here if I help you.

00:58.239 --> 01:00.671
Come on. Come on.
Hurry. Hurry.

01:09.533 --> 01:11.485
Bauer's with the Salazar
brothers in Mexico.

01:11.581 --> 01:13.820
His transponder signal
stopped working.

01:13.916 --> 01:15.899
We're doing everything we can
to reestablish contact.

01:15.995 --> 01:19.036
Tell the Delta units to hold
their position till I get back to you.

01:19.132 --> 01:21.338
There's been a complication.

01:21.434 --> 01:23.803
- Another buyer's interested in the virus.
- We have a deal.

01:23.930 --> 01:26.938
We'll hold an auction, and the virus
will go to the highest bidder.

01:27.034 --> 01:30.041
- We just found out there's
another player in the deal.
- Who is it?

01:30.137 --> 01:31.801
Nina Myers.

01:31.897 --> 01:34.873
Your bid is $225 million.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.496
Hers is 240. You win.

01:37.592 --> 01:40.183
- We can get the virus!
- How do you get the virus?

01:40.279 --> 01:43.190
I told you. I know her!
I can get to her!

01:43.286 --> 01:47.189
The Salazars are willing to pay you at least
10 times more than what you're getting paid now.

01:47.285 --> 01:50.293
Are you gonna be able to forgive me
for killing your wife?

01:50.389 --> 01:53.236
If I wanted revenge, Nina,
I would have killed you already.

01:53.332 --> 01:56.148
All I wanna do is finish this deal
and disappear for good.

01:56.244 --> 01:58.036
Convince me.

02:02.867 --> 02:07.410
The following takes place
between 11:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.537
Adam, is Amador moving yet?

02:11.633 --> 02:13.969
No. He's still stopped
at the location.

02:14.065 --> 02:15.888
What do we know
about the area?

02:15.984 --> 02:18.288
Um, it's mostly rural.
There's very few structures.

02:18.384 --> 02:21.327
- Do we have infrared on it?
- Yeah.

02:21.423 --> 02:23.375
It's not high-res satellite...

02:23.471 --> 02:26.254
but there appear to be a number
of vehicles and bodies nearby...

02:26.350 --> 02:28.366
but we have no idea
what they are.

02:28.462 --> 02:30.829
Give him space. We want to make
sure he feels safe enough...

02:30.925 --> 02:32.813
- "to take delivery of the virus."
- Got it.

02:32.909 --> 02:34.701
What's the latest
on Chase Edmunds?

02:34.797 --> 02:38.028
After he escaped from Hector,
he phoned his position into Delta teams...

02:38.124 --> 02:40.428
and they're en route
to pick him up now.

03:12.517 --> 03:14.341
- Edmunds?
- Yeah.

03:14.437 --> 03:17.380
- Captain Reiss. What's your condition?
- Shot in the hand, but I'm fine.

03:17.476 --> 03:20.611
- What about the others?
- I got two people. They're coming with me.

03:20.707 --> 03:23.172
We spotted a vehicle from
the air heading this way.

03:23.268 --> 03:26.691
It's the Salazars. They can't know that
C.T.U. Is here. We need to leave now!

03:26.787 --> 03:30.018
Then let's get them out of here.

03:30.114 --> 03:33.378
Sergio, we're getting on the chopper.
We're going to a safe place.

03:33.474 --> 03:37.216
- Oriol, we need to go right now.
- We can't leave her like this.

03:37.312 --> 03:41.311
Hector is coming.
You need to think about your son.

03:46.623 --> 03:48.831
- "Bueno. Vamonos."
- "We gotta go now!"

03:48.927 --> 03:51.390
Let's go! Let's go!
Move! Move! Move!

03:51.486 --> 03:54.397
Keep 'em low!
Keep 'em low!

03:54.493 --> 03:57.757
Get them in there!
Come on! Stay low! Stay low!

04:00.412 --> 04:02.236
Move out!

04:36.054 --> 04:38.357
- Yes?
- Alan?

04:38.453 --> 04:42.100
- It's Wayne Palmer.
- What do you want?

04:42.196 --> 04:45.843
I always thought you had more balls than
to threaten me through my brother.

04:45.939 --> 04:48.019
What, you can't talk
to me man-to-man?

04:48.115 --> 04:50.675
I don't owe you an explanation.
You slept with my wife.

04:50.771 --> 04:52.786
That's between
you and me, Alan.

04:52.882 --> 04:55.377
Fine. Step down,
and it all goes away.

04:55.473 --> 04:57.297
That's not your decision.

04:57.393 --> 04:59.217
We'll see.

04:59.313 --> 05:01.104
Wayne.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.520
Who you talking to?

05:05.616 --> 05:09.199
- Alan Milliken.
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

05:09.295 --> 05:11.279
Cleaning up my own mess, David.

05:14.510 --> 05:17.102
- Hello, Alan.
- Mr. President.

05:17.198 --> 05:20.364
That brother of yours
is going to be your undoing.

05:20.460 --> 05:23.213
- I am not firing my brother.
- That's too bad.

05:23.309 --> 05:26.252
And I have no intention
of losing my health care bill.

05:26.348 --> 05:28.843
I've spent two years
putting it together.

05:28.939 --> 05:31.499
Except you're three votes
short, last I checked.

05:31.595 --> 05:34.250
You'd better brace yourself
for some disappointment.

05:34.346 --> 05:36.810
I don't want to go
to war with you, Alan.

05:36.906 --> 05:39.081
It's your choice, Mr. President.

05:39.177 --> 05:42.473
The choice is unacceptable. There
has to be another way to work this out.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.608
On any other issue, I'd bend over
backwards to accommodate you.

05:45.704 --> 05:48.296
Not on this one.

05:48.392 --> 05:51.654
Then you have only yourself
to blame for the consequences.

05:51.750 --> 05:55.302
And I promise you...
you won't like them.

05:59.558 --> 06:01.413
When is Sherry getting here?

06:01.509 --> 06:04.452
- Five minutes.
- Good.

06:04.548 --> 06:06.500
Are you sure you want
to bring her into this?

06:06.596 --> 06:09.731
We're in a street fight, Wayne.
It's what she does best.

06:09.827 --> 06:13.314
And we both have to focus
on what's happening in Mexico.

06:13.410 --> 06:17.826
I know we're hoping for success,
but we have to anticipate failure.

06:17.922 --> 06:20.769
If Jack Bauer
does not intercept the virus...

06:20.865 --> 06:24.000
then we are dealing
with an international crisis.

06:24.096 --> 06:26.080
This is Michael Amador.

06:26.176 --> 06:29.024
He's representing the Ukrainians
in the sale of the virus.

06:29.120 --> 06:33.503
Now, we have a Delta team tracking him
on the ground at a safe distance.

06:33.599 --> 06:35.615
Why don't they get Amador
if they know where he is?

06:35.711 --> 06:37.662
'Cause he may not
be carrying the virus.

06:37.758 --> 06:40.221
And if he's not, we'd have blown
our chance at the interception.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.964
Once Jack confirms it is the virus,
then the Delta teams will go in and secure it.

06:44.060 --> 06:46.205
Delta asked for a photo of
the woman Jack's working with...

06:46.300 --> 06:48.252
- "so I sent 'em this..."
- Adam, wait.

06:51.227 --> 06:53.115
Nina Myers is the broker?

06:55.034 --> 06:58.362
- Didn't you read the ops brief?
- No.

07:00.026 --> 07:03.321
Kim, come with me.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.912
- Would you finish the briefing, please?
- Yeah.

07:11.863 --> 07:13.687
I'm sorry.

07:13.783 --> 07:16.214
I was looking for
the right time to tell you.

07:16.310 --> 07:19.094
I cannot believe Nina Myers
is involved in this.

07:19.190 --> 07:21.814
Your father needed her help
to secure the virus.

07:21.910 --> 07:25.076
She killed my mother.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.548
My father couldn't even
pretend to work with her.

07:42.449 --> 07:44.721
I'm sorry, Jack.

07:47.857 --> 07:49.680
I'm sorry, Jack.

07:51.695 --> 07:55.982
I wanted to think you'd
changed, but I can feel it.

07:56.078 --> 07:57.902
You're lying.

08:04.205 --> 08:06.572
You haven't forgotten
anything, have you?

08:07.981 --> 08:09.805
You despise me...

08:09.901 --> 08:13.835
and you'd do anything right now
to get me to go along with your plan.

08:13.931 --> 08:16.075
That's not true.

08:16.171 --> 08:18.379
It is true.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.954
I know you're still
with C.T.U.

08:24.233 --> 08:27.464
So why would I let you
set me up?

08:40.519 --> 08:43.494
Now, you can believe
whatever you want...

08:43.589 --> 08:45.733
but I need this deal
to happen.

08:45.829 --> 08:47.845
I'm a fugitive.
I don't have a choice.

08:47.941 --> 08:50.212
I need the Salazars
to pay me for the virus...

08:50.308 --> 08:52.420
and you're the only person
Amador will deal with.

08:52.516 --> 08:55.108
Do you understand me?

08:59.938 --> 09:03.458
I'll honor your original deal.
You'll get your $20 million.

09:03.554 --> 09:05.953
And you get
to keep breathing.

09:06.082 --> 09:08.289
Until my client doesn't
get what he paid for.

09:08.385 --> 09:12.576
Right now, your client should be
the least of your worries.

09:46.458 --> 09:50.233
Hector, she's dead.

09:52.312 --> 09:54.424
Get away from her.

10:10.869 --> 10:14.613
Claudia.

10:33.648 --> 10:35.952
They can't be far away.
Find them!

10:36.048 --> 10:39.535
Find them! Find them!

10:41.423 --> 10:43.695
I just spoke
to the Mexican authorities.

10:43.791 --> 10:46.158
They're pissed off that
we didn't notify them earlier.

10:46.286 --> 10:49.197
It's Hector.

10:52.909 --> 10:55.917
- You set?
- Go.

10:56.013 --> 10:58.188
Yeah.

10:58.284 --> 11:01.771
It's me. Edmunds escaped.
He killed three of my men.

11:01.867 --> 11:04.203
Has he contacted C.T. U?

11:04.299 --> 11:06.794
Not yet.
But he may not call.

11:06.890 --> 11:10.057
I found out Edmunds is rogue.
He's been acting on his own.

11:10.153 --> 11:12.425
Then C.T.U. Hasn't sent anyone
down here to find him?

11:12.521 --> 11:14.793
They don't even know
where he is.

11:14.889 --> 11:19.272
- Okay, you call me the second you hear from him.
- I will.

11:28.326 --> 11:30.662
- Yeah.
- Are you still with Bauer?

11:30.758 --> 11:32.869
I'm at the main road
that leads into town.

11:32.965 --> 11:36.005
- I'm waiting for Bauer to bring the woman.
- We have to call this off.

11:36.101 --> 11:37.924
What are you talking about?

11:38.020 --> 11:40.323
The C.T.U. Agent Edmunds,
he escaped.

11:40.419 --> 11:42.659
- How?
- I don't know. Claudia was with him.

11:44.579 --> 11:47.842
Ramon, she's dead.

11:51.234 --> 11:53.057
I'm sorry.

11:53.153 --> 11:55.425
But, Hector, we still
have business to do.

11:55.521 --> 11:58.912
Not with Edmunds on the loose. As soon
as he gets to a phone, he'll call C.T.U.

11:59.008 --> 12:01.599
- Find him before that happens.
- I'm trying, but it's too dark.

12:01.695 --> 12:04.319
- He'll be impossible to track.
- What are you suggesting we do?

12:04.415 --> 12:06.431
Forget this whole thing.
It's too dangerous.

12:06.527 --> 12:08.351
- It's always been dangerous.
- Not like this.

12:08.447 --> 12:10.461
Listen to me. You were
the one who made this deal.

12:10.557 --> 12:12.893
You promised our buyers
something we can't deliver.

12:12.989 --> 12:15.325
If you don't keep your
promise, my reputation...

12:15.421 --> 12:17.693
and everything I worked for
will be ruined.

12:17.789 --> 12:20.476
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

12:20.571 --> 12:22.460
Keep some of your men
looking for Edmunds...

12:22.556 --> 12:26.970
and bring the rest of the men here,
so we can do the deal.

12:32.666 --> 12:34.490
Yes.

12:34.586 --> 12:37.272
Ramon, it's Jack.
Everything clear outside?

12:37.368 --> 12:39.992
- Yes.
- Okay. I need you to come back to the building.

12:40.088 --> 12:42.423
Did the woman agree
to work with us?

12:42.519 --> 12:44.984
I'll explain
when you get here.

13:02.836 --> 13:05.972
Yes.

13:06.068 --> 13:08.243
- Mr. President.
- "Yes, Aaron."

13:08.339 --> 13:10.578
Sherry Palmer is here.

13:13.362 --> 13:16.178
Show her in.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.999
Thank you.

13:30.095 --> 13:31.918
Hello, Sherry.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.054
David.

13:35.150 --> 13:36.974
Thank you, Aaron.

13:40.748 --> 13:42.572
Please have a seat.

13:42.668 --> 13:46.156
Uh, no, thank you.
I, uh... I'd rather stand.

13:50.635 --> 13:53.802
So, uh, how are things
with Anne?

13:53.898 --> 13:55.498
They're fine.

13:55.594 --> 13:58.697
Good. I'm glad.

13:58.793 --> 14:01.417
You, uh...

14:01.513 --> 14:03.784
You deserve a little bit
of happiness.

14:03.880 --> 14:07.016
Thank you.
You're looking well.

14:07.112 --> 14:10.694
- But somehow different.
- A little older?

14:10.790 --> 14:13.606
No, it's not that.

14:15.686 --> 14:17.477
You look calm.

14:17.573 --> 14:20.773
Um, tired, maybe.

14:20.869 --> 14:24.164
But, uh, I'm not sure
exactly how calm.

14:26.339 --> 14:31.139
I know these last three years
have been difficult.

14:31.235 --> 14:34.018
Well, um...

14:34.114 --> 14:37.601
not as difficult
as they could have been.

14:37.697 --> 14:42.145
And, uh, I have you
to thank for that.

14:42.241 --> 14:45.920
You kept me out of prison,
away from public humiliation.

14:46.016 --> 14:48.287
I, um...

14:48.383 --> 14:51.614
I lost a lot.

14:51.710 --> 14:54.910
But most of it,
I discovered...

14:55.006 --> 14:57.790
really wasn't that
important to begin with.

14:57.886 --> 15:02.077
Which surprised me...
Imagine that.

15:06.460 --> 15:10.139
- What? What's funny?
- No, nothing, really.

15:10.235 --> 15:13.691
It's just that when
I wanted you to pull back...

15:13.787 --> 15:17.946
and just let things be,
you were a shark.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.497
Now that I've asked you back,
I need you to be a shark.

15:21.593 --> 15:27.096
I can still be
whatever you need me to be.

15:33.719 --> 15:35.606
Thank you.

15:37.334 --> 15:41.590
So you say you're having some
kind of trouble with Milliken.

15:41.717 --> 15:44.821
Yes. I am.

15:47.668 --> 15:51.700
Okay. Tell me all about it.

16:14.191 --> 16:17.455
Handcuffs? I thought you
were going to gain her trust.

16:17.551 --> 16:21.294
I will. It's just going to take
a little longer than I hoped.

16:26.157 --> 16:29.228
She agreed to do the exchange.
That's what's important.

16:29.324 --> 16:32.364
- When is it happening?
- As soon as Amador calls.

16:32.460 --> 16:35.787
Amador better call soon.
We might not have much time.

16:35.914 --> 16:38.859
Your partner escaped.

16:38.955 --> 16:41.802
You should have let me kill him
when I had the chance.

16:41.898 --> 16:44.041
Yes, I should have.

16:44.137 --> 16:47.113
For some reason,
Claudia was with him.

16:47.209 --> 16:49.384
She ended up dead.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.296
What are you
talking about? How?

16:52.392 --> 16:54.792
Hector didn't say.

17:00.678 --> 17:02.982
Tell Hector I'm sorry.

17:03.078 --> 17:06.277
Tell him yourself
when he gets here.

17:17.155 --> 17:20.355
Nina, I need you to open up
this transaction file.

17:20.451 --> 17:23.617
Amador's gonna want to verify
your client's funds.

17:25.890 --> 17:28.353
Now!

17:39.295 --> 17:42.590
Bottom line is, Alan's
determined to see Wayne removed...

17:42.686 --> 17:45.181
even if it means
destroying my presidency.

17:45.277 --> 17:50.109
- And you've tried to work this out peacefully?
- Of course. Alan wouldn't budge.

17:50.205 --> 17:52.604
In Alan's mind,
it's a matter of pride.

17:52.732 --> 17:57.595
So, you want me to find something
you can use against Alan?

18:01.050 --> 18:04.058
I've always known that you
knew things about Alan...

18:04.154 --> 18:07.417
that you didn't tell me because
of my friendship with him.

18:07.513 --> 18:11.193
And I've always known
you were too smart to ask.

18:11.289 --> 18:13.880
Well, I guess we're both right.

18:16.568 --> 18:19.159
Alan does have skeletons
in his closet...

18:19.255 --> 18:21.591
that he would guard
at any cost.

18:21.687 --> 18:23.702
One in particular
comes to mind.

18:23.798 --> 18:27.030
But I must warn you, David,
it's a big one.

18:27.126 --> 18:29.045
What is it?

18:29.173 --> 18:32.244
All you need to know
is that if you play this card...

18:32.340 --> 18:36.596
you and Alan Milliken will be enemies
for the rest of your life.

18:36.692 --> 18:41.043
As far as I'm concerned, our friendship
ended when he tried to extort me.

18:45.138 --> 18:47.025
Then I can help you.

18:50.737 --> 18:54.449
Choppers four and five...
our insertion points are here and here.

19:00.015 --> 19:03.503
Claudia's dead.
Why'd she die?

19:05.486 --> 19:07.437
So we could be safe.

19:07.533 --> 19:10.862
Your sister
was very brave, Sergio.

19:10.989 --> 19:13.836
Now we don't have to worry
about Hector no more.

19:13.964 --> 19:16.364
But I like Hector.

19:26.762 --> 19:31.497
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Will do. Copy that.

19:31.625 --> 19:33.993
That's good enough.
Give it to me.

19:34.121 --> 19:35.945
I'm not finished.

19:37.224 --> 19:39.464
Reiss, what's going on?

19:39.560 --> 19:42.855
Hector Salazar's looking for us. C.T.U.
Wants me to pull back my surveillance team.

19:42.983 --> 19:45.767
- We can't lose Amador.
- We won't.
C.T.U.'s tracking him through his cell phone.

19:45.863 --> 19:48.902
- He can dump his cell phone. We need visual.
- Don't worry about that.

19:48.998 --> 19:52.261
- It's not your problem anymore.
- Don't tell me it's not my problem!

19:52.357 --> 19:54.405
It's been my problem
for the last year!

19:54.501 --> 19:57.284
Look, Edmunds.
You need medical attention.

19:57.380 --> 20:00.068
We're evacuating you
with the boy and his father now.

20:00.164 --> 20:02.403
I'm not going anywhere.

20:04.483 --> 20:06.563
- Mr. Chappelle.
- Yeah.

20:06.659 --> 20:09.634
I'm picking up on some heat signatures
moving in on Amador's position.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.225
- "Ground vehicles?"
- "From the speed, it looks like it."

20:12.321 --> 20:14.145
All right.
This may be the virus.

20:14.241 --> 20:17.472
- Do you want me to contact the Delta teams?
- Yeah. Put 'em on alert.

20:17.568 --> 20:20.512
But make sure they don't approach
until Amador meets Bauer.

20:20.608 --> 20:23.455
- We want a visual on the virus.
- Okay. Got it.

21:23.380 --> 21:27.283
- "Sherry."
- Wayne.

21:30.130 --> 21:32.114
What are you doing in here?

21:32.210 --> 21:35.185
Oh, I'm just waiting for them
to prepare an office for me.

21:35.281 --> 21:38.576
It's good to see you,
Sherry, but to be blunt...

21:38.672 --> 21:41.168
I don't think your being here
is such a good idea.

21:41.264 --> 21:43.088
Well, of course
you don't, sweetie...

21:43.184 --> 21:45.199
because this whole thing
is about your indiscretion with Julia.

21:45.295 --> 21:48.302
- Oh, Sherry.
- I say that with no judgment.

21:48.398 --> 21:52.590
Of course you do... since you're the last person
on earth who's in a position to pass judgment.

21:52.686 --> 21:56.494
Okay, Wayne, let's not play this.
We're both too good at it.

21:56.621 --> 21:59.660
So, what do you
want me to hear?

22:01.324 --> 22:03.820
Listen. I do appreciate you
comin' down here to help...

22:03.916 --> 22:06.539
No, no, no, no.
Skip... that part.

22:06.635 --> 22:10.058
Oh, that's right. I forgot that about you.

22:10.154 --> 22:12.010
Listen, Sherry...

22:12.106 --> 22:16.841
do whatever it is that you do
around here for a few hours.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.657
But then I want you to tell David
that you were unable to find out...

22:19.753 --> 22:24.232
- anything that he could use on Alan Milliken.
- Mm. So, you know if I do that...

22:24.328 --> 22:27.879
the only way out of this
is if you resign.

22:27.975 --> 22:31.015
- Which is what I wanna do.
- Well, David doesn't want that.

22:31.111 --> 22:34.918
- And, frankly, neither do I.
- Sherry, why do you care?

22:35.046 --> 22:37.349
Because David
needs someone like me...

22:37.445 --> 22:39.845
someone who sees things
the way they really are...

22:39.973 --> 22:43.300
who's not afraid to throw
a punch every now and then.

22:43.428 --> 22:47.236
It's obvious I can't play
that role anymore, but you can.

22:49.123 --> 22:52.803
No, Wayne. I feel good
knowing David's got you...

22:52.899 --> 22:54.978
and I'm gonna make sure
he keeps you.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.474
So save your breath.
I'm gonna fix this...

22:57.601 --> 23:01.024
and you are gonna make sure
your brother gets reelected.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.432
Fine.

23:06.528 --> 23:11.422
But, Sherry, don't you forget
how dangerous Alan Milliken can be.

23:11.518 --> 23:13.630
Oh, I won't forget.

23:15.358 --> 23:18.685
I'm afraid you're
the one who forgot...

23:18.781 --> 23:21.820
when you decided to get
involved with his wife.

23:23.548 --> 23:26.172
No, we haven't heard directly
from Jack in over an hour...

23:26.268 --> 23:28.123
but our Delta teams
are on standby.

23:28.219 --> 23:30.331
All right.
We'll monitor it from here.

23:30.427 --> 23:32.443
- Uh-huh.
- Okay. I'll let him know.

23:32.539 --> 23:34.650
"All right. Good."

23:34.746 --> 23:37.306
Do you have any more
information on Nina Myers?

23:37.402 --> 23:39.546
No, not yet.

23:39.642 --> 23:43.257
Look, Kim.
I know it's hard...

23:43.353 --> 23:46.425
but you're gonna have to put your
feelings aside till all this is over.

23:46.521 --> 23:49.048
How can I put my feelings aside?

23:49.144 --> 23:51.384
How can my father
put his feelings aside?

23:54.838 --> 23:58.902
I've spent the last three years
of my life knowing that the woman...

23:58.998 --> 24:03.221
who killed my mother was
pardoned by the president...

24:03.317 --> 24:07.156
and that she's out there...

24:07.284 --> 24:09.652
living her life.

24:09.780 --> 24:11.859
And it's wrong.

24:11.955 --> 24:14.163
I know.

24:14.259 --> 24:16.083
She's violating
her pardon, isn't she?

24:16.179 --> 24:18.066
- She's buying and selling a virus.
- Kim...

24:18.194 --> 24:19.858
We cannot let her
get away this time.

24:19.953 --> 24:21.969
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves here.

24:22.065 --> 24:24.721
Please, Tony. She has to pay
for what she's done.

24:27.952 --> 24:32.175
Promise me when this is all over,
you'll at least help make that happen.

24:36.750 --> 24:39.534
- Yeah.
- "Tony, this is Chloe."

24:39.630 --> 24:41.550
- "Is Kim in there?"
- "Yeah."

24:41.677 --> 24:43.949
- I need her.
- All right. She's on her way.

24:50.348 --> 24:53.867
Kim.
I'll do what I can.

24:55.019 --> 24:57.546
Thank you.

24:57.642 --> 25:02.121
Shh. It's okay.

25:02.217 --> 25:04.969
Good girl. Nice and warm.

25:05.065 --> 25:08.136
- Yes?
- Chloe, where are
the index keys for Salazar?

25:08.232 --> 25:10.696
- Who is this?
- Patrick in Comm One.

25:10.792 --> 25:13.352
You guys aren't authorized
to access those keys.

25:13.448 --> 25:15.335
I'll come down
and do it for you.

25:15.431 --> 25:18.342
- I'm just trying to save some time.
- I'll be down in a minute.

25:18.438 --> 25:19.974
Fine.

25:20.966 --> 25:23.334
Chloe. You wanted me?

25:23.430 --> 25:25.829
Michelle needs me to brief
some people in Division.

25:25.957 --> 25:28.581
Then I have to go to Comm One,
give them index keys.

25:28.677 --> 25:30.980
I need you to watch
some things up here for me.

25:31.076 --> 25:33.603
- Can you do your work from my station?
- Yeah, I guess so.

25:33.699 --> 25:36.323
Good. This is Angela.
She's just been fed, so she'll sleep.

25:36.419 --> 25:38.435
If she gets fussy,
put that in her mouth.

25:38.531 --> 25:40.578
But, you can't have
a baby in here.

25:40.674 --> 25:43.682
Chappelle thinks I had someone pick her up.
If he comes up, keep her hidden.

25:45.249 --> 25:48.000
- Yeah... l... But I can't...
- I'll be back in 15 minutes.

25:59.454 --> 26:00.990
Ramon.

26:09.437 --> 26:12.476
- Jack's not who you think he is.
- Is that right?

26:12.572 --> 26:14.907
He's working with C.T.U.
He's setting you up.

26:15.003 --> 26:18.491
Do you think that my brother
and I are that stupid?

26:18.587 --> 26:21.498
We made sure that
he's acting alone.

26:21.626 --> 26:24.314
Don't you even think
of undermining this deal.

26:29.849 --> 26:33.176
Hey, Jack.
I think it's Amador.

26:39.063 --> 26:41.783
Put this phone on speaker.
You say one wrong word...

26:41.879 --> 26:44.086
and he will kill you.

26:44.182 --> 26:46.454
You understand?

26:46.550 --> 26:48.693
Go.

26:48.789 --> 26:50.933
- Hello.
- I've got the product.

26:51.029 --> 26:54.068
- Are you ready to show me your account?
- Yes.

26:54.164 --> 26:56.180
We agreed you'd provide
audit privileges.

26:56.276 --> 26:58.099
Yes. Tell me
your routing number.

26:58.195 --> 27:02.706
77509210.

27:02.802 --> 27:07.505
Account number
45508996.

27:09.329 --> 27:11.665
Okay.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.888
The funds are in their account,
ready to be transferred?

27:15.983 --> 27:17.807
Yeah.

27:17.903 --> 27:21.134
There's an old mine
east of Posta Mita.

27:21.230 --> 27:24.462
Meet me in the northernmost building
in an hour and 10 minutes.

27:24.558 --> 27:26.734
I'll have one man
with me for security.

27:26.830 --> 27:28.654
You may do the same.

27:30.189 --> 27:34.220
Good. We'll leave
as soon as Hector arrives.

28:07.046 --> 28:08.966
Yuri.

28:30.082 --> 28:32.194
- Amador's on the move.
- What direction?

28:32.290 --> 28:35.041
- "East."
- "Likely destination?"

28:35.137 --> 28:38.208
There's half a dozen villages along
the vector. It could be any one of them.

28:38.304 --> 28:40.127
With all due respect,
Adam was right.

28:40.223 --> 28:42.911
We should order Delta team
to move in now and arrest Amador.

28:43.007 --> 28:46.622
We've been over this. If the virus isn't
under Amador's control, we could lose it.

28:46.718 --> 28:49.406
- We gotta wait for Jack's confirmation.
- How will he let us know?

28:49.502 --> 28:51.869
The Salazars are watching.
It's not like he can make a phone call.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.885
I don't know. He'll find a way.

29:01.819 --> 29:04.059
I don't know. It's awfully late.

29:04.155 --> 29:07.450
I can try...

29:07.579 --> 29:11.322
David, don't you think it's about time
we informed the Mexican government...

29:11.418 --> 29:14.201
exactly what it is
we're doing on their soil?

29:14.297 --> 29:16.633
No. I don't want to risk
compromising the operation.

29:16.729 --> 29:18.744
Then you should call
the president yourself.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.240
Once he understands what kind
of threat this virus poses...

29:21.367 --> 29:23.191
he should ease up.

29:23.287 --> 29:25.175
Yes.

29:25.271 --> 29:28.438
Sir, Alan Milliken
is holding for you on line five.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.422
Thank you, Aaron.

29:37.269 --> 29:40.372
- Yes, Alan.
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

29:40.468 --> 29:43.795
- What are you talking about?
- Don't screw with me, David.

29:43.923 --> 29:48.307
- I didn't pick this fight.
- You think you can enlist
your psychopathic ex-wife...

29:48.403 --> 29:51.026
to manufacture lies about me
in order to bring me down?

29:51.122 --> 29:53.521
- It's not going to happen.
- If you want it to stop...

29:53.650 --> 29:56.625
keep your hands off my health care bill
and stay away from my brother!

29:56.721 --> 29:58.545
You've got it backwards.

29:58.641 --> 30:01.520
Your brother should have
stayed away from my wife.

30:01.648 --> 30:03.696
- Come on, Alan. It's over.
- Really?

30:03.792 --> 30:06.607
I'm looking at photographs of her
and Wayne together an hour ago.

30:08.878 --> 30:11.694
He was just trying to convince her
to talk some sense into you.

30:11.790 --> 30:15.565
I'm warning you, David.
Pull Sherry off this...

30:15.693 --> 30:19.149
or the health care bill will be
the least of your problems.

30:22.699 --> 30:24.364
Alan's scared.

30:24.460 --> 30:27.371
Alan is at his most dangerous
when he's scared.

30:27.499 --> 30:29.866
Mm-hmm.

30:32.522 --> 30:36.522
Tell the Mexican ambassador that
I'll be calling his president directly.

30:48.391 --> 30:50.758
" She's still out of town."

30:50.854 --> 30:53.318
I heard you the first time,
sweetie. I'm not deaf.

30:53.414 --> 30:56.997
I understand she's on vacation. I just
want to talk to her about Chagrin Falls.

30:57.093 --> 30:59.013
- And give her this number, okay?
- "All right."

30:59.141 --> 31:00.964
Thank you.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.044
Yes, David?

31:03.140 --> 31:05.923
I just got off the phone
with Alan Milliken.

31:08.643 --> 31:10.978
- The blowback happened quickly, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

31:11.074 --> 31:13.922
- I guess he was pretty upset.
- What have you been up to?

31:14.018 --> 31:17.793
Exactly... what
you asked me to do.

31:17.922 --> 31:20.705
I'm fighting back.

31:20.801 --> 31:24.096
Hmm. What's Chagrin Falls,
and what happened there?

31:25.472 --> 31:28.767
Well, it's something that
Alan wants to keep buried.

31:28.863 --> 31:31.743
David, I'm gonna tell you
everything, but not just now.

31:31.871 --> 31:35.934
I've got a lot to get done in a very short
period of time if I'm gonna pull this off.

31:37.118 --> 31:39.389
All right.

31:39.485 --> 31:41.757
Right here, across
from the opening of the mine.

31:41.853 --> 31:44.764
- Looks like there's enough cover to hide your men.
- You're right. Good.

31:48.027 --> 31:50.811
- Did you find Edmunds?
- No. It's too dark to find him.

31:50.907 --> 31:53.691
You don't need to look for Edmunds.
Even if he contacted C. T. U...

31:53.787 --> 31:56.570
they don't have enough time to get
down here before the deal happens.

31:56.666 --> 31:59.450
What makes you so sure
they're not already here?

31:59.545 --> 32:02.393
Didn't Gael tell you
Edmunds came down alone?

32:05.016 --> 32:08.120
Why is she tied up? Bauer said
he's going to buy her cooperation.

32:08.216 --> 32:11.095
Don't worry.
She'll do what she's told.

32:18.165 --> 32:20.246
Ramon, could I speak
to you in private?

32:26.740 --> 32:28.563
What is it?

32:28.659 --> 32:31.028
This is not the plan.
I don't like it.

32:31.124 --> 32:34.419
Hector, I know you are upset about
Claudia, but there's no reason to panic.

32:34.515 --> 32:36.594
I'm not panicking.
I'm being sensible.

32:36.690 --> 32:38.610
This was your deal
in the first place.

32:38.738 --> 32:42.385
And you were against it, remember?
You was right, and I was wrong.

32:42.481 --> 32:44.625
Edmunds escapes,
Claudia is dead...

32:44.721 --> 32:47.856
and now this woman goes
only along at gunpoint.

32:47.952 --> 32:50.735
- It doesn't feel right.
- We don't have a choice.

32:50.831 --> 32:53.838
The buyers are waiting for this deal
to happen because of you.

32:53.934 --> 32:56.174
Ramon, things are not
going as planned.

32:56.270 --> 32:58.030
The plans have changed.

32:58.126 --> 33:01.358
C.T.U., Dessler.

33:01.454 --> 33:03.597
We are following through
with what you have started.

33:03.693 --> 33:05.868
- Hello?
- There are too many risks now.

33:05.964 --> 33:09.260
- "They are unavoidable."
- Ramon, sorry to interrupt...

33:09.388 --> 33:11.915
but if you want this deal
to happen, we've got to go now.

33:12.011 --> 33:14.635
Tony, Jack's on the line.
He's using his cell as a one-way.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.554
Put it on speaker.

33:16.650 --> 33:19.018
Amador's gonna be at the mine
at Posta Mita in about an hour.

33:19.114 --> 33:22.857
It's gonna take us that long to get there
and get your men into position.

33:22.953 --> 33:27.113
Bauer is right. Our men need to be
in place before Amador gets there.

33:30.888 --> 33:32.903
I still haven't signed off on this.

33:32.999 --> 33:36.230
You do what I tell you to do.

33:36.326 --> 33:41.285
Now, call your men and tell them
to be at the village outside the mine.

33:41.381 --> 33:43.493
Damn it! My battery.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.989
Hey, Jack,
where's the other phone?

33:46.117 --> 33:48.228
Got it here.

33:51.779 --> 33:54.691
- It's disconnected.
- All right. They told us what we need to know.

33:54.819 --> 33:57.698
Get the Delta teams into position.
Make sure they set up a quarantine zone...

33:57.827 --> 34:00.194
in case the virus gets
out there in the exchange.

34:02.882 --> 34:04.737
Bauer made it through.

34:04.833 --> 34:08.576
The deal is going down near a mine
just outside of Posta Mita in 55 minutes.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.560
How long until
you're able to mobilize?

34:10.656 --> 34:13.600
We've got the coordinates.
We're moving out now.

34:13.696 --> 34:16.607
- Your men are mobilizing.
- They're bunkering three
kilometers from the strike zone.

34:16.735 --> 34:19.614
- How did you find out where
the exchange is going down?
- Bauer got through to C.T.U.

34:19.742 --> 34:21.438
It's going down in 55 minutes.

34:21.534 --> 34:23.837
You're keeping your men three clicks away?
Not exactly a front-row seat.

34:23.933 --> 34:25.821
I'm keeping them
out of sight.

34:25.949 --> 34:28.219
Then how are you gonna confirm
the package contains the virus?

34:28.315 --> 34:31.292
- I'm sending in a forward observer.
- Picked anyone yet?

34:31.388 --> 34:34.842
- No, not yet.
- I'll do it.

34:34.938 --> 34:37.210
We got people trained
for that, Edmunds.

34:37.306 --> 34:39.130
I'm trained for it too!

34:39.226 --> 34:41.690
Besides, I know
the Salazars, remember?

34:41.786 --> 34:44.440
- Your hand.
- This isn't combat. It's observation.

34:44.536 --> 34:46.841
All right. Cottrell!

34:46.937 --> 34:49.945
Gear this man up
with a surveillance package!

34:59.702 --> 35:03.126
- Get over it, Hector.
- Not until you respect what I have to say.

35:03.222 --> 35:06.454
- The Americans could be hiding anywhere.
- There's no more time to argue.

35:06.550 --> 35:08.373
Stop talking down to me.

35:08.469 --> 35:12.532
Did you already forget the only reason
why you are here is because of me!

35:12.628 --> 35:15.700
- Who got you out of prison?
- Bauer got me out, not you!

35:15.796 --> 35:19.027
And now that I'm out, you take orders
from me, just like you always have.

35:19.123 --> 35:21.331
- Ramon...
- It's over, Hector! No more talking.

35:23.058 --> 35:25.330
We're gonna do the deal now.

35:26.641 --> 35:29.265
Bauer, get her in the car.

35:30.673 --> 35:32.432
You can't control this, Jack.

35:32.528 --> 35:35.056
Just get in the car.

35:36.815 --> 35:40.111
" Hombres, vamonos.

35:57.611 --> 36:00.363
What's the matter?

36:00.459 --> 36:03.178
Please don't cry.
It's okay.

36:05.962 --> 36:08.777
- What did you do to her?
- "l- I didn't do anything to her."

36:08.873 --> 36:10.825
Well, you must've
done something.

36:10.953 --> 36:14.536
Chloe, look.... I promise you.
I didn't do anything to her.

36:14.632 --> 36:16.968
Look, I'm gonna redirect all
my files back down to my desk.

36:17.064 --> 36:18.696
- Fine.
- I'm finished with this.

36:18.792 --> 36:22.918
Jack and Nina are meeting Amador in
53 minutes in a place called Posta Mita.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.838
What about Delta force?

36:24.934 --> 36:27.270
They've established a perimeter
of three kilometers.

36:27.366 --> 36:31.109
- "What the hell is that?"
- Damn it. I told her.

36:31.205 --> 36:34.276
Michelle, will you take care
of this, please.

36:36.708 --> 36:39.556
That's it, Chloe.
You're out of here.

36:39.651 --> 36:41.539
I told you I didn't have
anyone to watch her.

36:41.667 --> 36:44.290
You'll watch her. I gave you a warning.
Now you're suspended.

36:44.386 --> 36:47.682
- It was a verbal warning only.
- Ryan.

36:50.241 --> 36:53.536
- What?
- Jack's meeting Amador in less than an hour.

36:53.632 --> 36:56.001
We have no visual
satellite coverage of that area.

36:56.128 --> 36:58.336
What does that
have to do with this baby?

36:58.432 --> 37:00.735
We're gonna have to use
digitally enhanced audio coverage.

37:00.831 --> 37:03.135
Chloe is the best we have at that.

37:03.231 --> 37:06.558
So you're telling me we have to let this
woman raise her child in our office...

37:06.687 --> 37:08.989
because we don't have anyone
who can do her job?

37:09.085 --> 37:13.501
What I'm telling you is maybe we should deal
with Chloe's child care problems on another day.

37:13.597 --> 37:16.156
Okay, that's a girl.

37:19.228 --> 37:21.403
I have work to do.
Who's gonna look after my child?

37:24.346 --> 37:27.706
- Give her to Kim.
- What?

37:27.867 --> 37:30.426
Based on what C.T.U. Got from Jack,
the meeting'll probably take place here...

37:30.522 --> 37:32.953
by an old mine
at the northern end of town.

37:33.081 --> 37:35.320
My position is gonna be here.

37:35.416 --> 37:37.240
I need you to put your men
behind this ridge...

37:37.336 --> 37:39.608
until we know
that the virus is real.

37:39.704 --> 37:41.784
It's good natural cover.
That'll work.

37:41.880 --> 37:45.559
- How long will it take your
men to get to the old mine?
- Ninety seconds.

37:45.655 --> 37:48.022
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

38:27.855 --> 38:29.678
Where are the rest
of the men?

38:29.774 --> 38:31.598
Felipe brought
everyone he could bring.

38:31.694 --> 38:33.165
- There's not enough!
- It's all right.

38:33.294 --> 38:35.949
- Amador is only bringing one man.
- Or so he says.

38:36.045 --> 38:37.869
Stop making problems
where there are none.

38:37.965 --> 38:39.916
I'm just trying to make
sure we are covered.

38:40.044 --> 38:42.924
You're trying to stop this deal from
happening because you lost your nerve.

38:43.052 --> 38:46.731
- Things are moving too fast.
We haven't had enough time.
- We'll be fine.

38:46.827 --> 38:49.931
- Just because you say we'll be
fine doesn't mean we'll be fine!
- The situation is difficult.

38:50.027 --> 38:52.554
Don't make it worse!
All right?

38:54.410 --> 38:56.233
Or what?

38:56.329 --> 38:59.625
Ramon, if you want this deal to happen,
we have to leave now. We have to be...

38:59.721 --> 39:02.024
at the mine in 20 minutes,
before Amador gets there.

39:02.120 --> 39:03.997
The deal is off!

39:12.998 --> 39:16.293
- Yes? All right.
- Ma'am, they're waiting for you.

39:26.211 --> 39:28.355
Hector, we're not done here.

39:28.451 --> 39:30.275
I've said what I need to say.

39:30.371 --> 39:32.418
Listen to me, Hector.
Listen to me carefully.

39:32.514 --> 39:34.785
If we don't give our buyers
what we promised them...

39:34.881 --> 39:37.953
we won't just lose money,
we'll lose respect.

39:38.049 --> 39:40.865
And without that,
we have nothing.

39:45.152 --> 39:47.039
We'll have our lives.

39:49.247 --> 39:51.359
We're leaving now.

39:52.734 --> 39:55.134
Pablo, Felipe, "vamos."

39:58.973 --> 40:00.733
Now!

40:06.140 --> 40:09.211
Hector, don't do this.

40:20.281 --> 40:22.169
Hector!

40:25.400 --> 40:28.535
Hector! Hector!

40:29.305 --> 40:35.575
