SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA

00:15.330 --> 00:17.491
Can't stop thinkin'

00:17.500 --> 00:19.661
About you, girl

00:19.670 --> 00:21.820
You know I just can't
get you off my mind

00:22.750 --> 00:27.164
Step up, knee up.
Step down. Up. One more.

00:27.170 --> 00:29.786
Two kicks. Here we go. Woo!

00:29.790 --> 00:35.069
One more time. Kick and back.
Two more times like that. One more.

00:36.580 --> 00:39.037
Two more times. Hang with me.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.746
Let's tap, right here.

00:40.750 --> 00:44.959
Two knees up, let's go. Here we go.
Knees, one more. Kick it up.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.416
Two times.

01:41.210 --> 01:43.030
Stay strong. Keep going.

01:43.040 --> 01:47.613
Knee up, tap down. One more time.

01:47.620 --> 01:50.202
One kick, and take it over the top.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.531
Knee up, tap down. Up.

01:52.540 --> 01:55.782
One more. Knees t0 the corners.

01:55.790 --> 01:57.109
Tap down.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.954
Kick it up two times. Kick. One more.

02:00.960 --> 02:05.579
Over the top. Two more times. Up.
Last time.

02:05.580 --> 02:09.323
Single knees up to the corners.
Reach and pull. Take it up.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.208
Stay strong.
Come on, I know you're tired.

02:12.210 --> 02:13.416
Last one.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.667
Single knees up, pull to here.
Knee and tap. Don't give up now!

02:17.670 --> 02:19.069
Here we go!

02:39.040 --> 02:40.530
Get a good shot of her face.

02:46.170 --> 02:47.455
Make a wish.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.997
F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

02:50.000 --> 02:54.573
-Come on, man. Blow, baby, blow.
-I thought you were full of hot air, Reid.

02:54.580 --> 02:57.037
Come on, Reid!
-They're trick candles, Spence, okay?

02:57.040 --> 02:59.827
They... They're going to come back
on every time.

02:59.830 --> 03:01.570
Mommy to the rescue.

03:01.580 --> 03:03.491
Ignore him.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.242
Isn't it amazing he knows what he knows,
and he's only twenty-four?

03:06.250 --> 03:07.990
Reid, does it make you legal yet?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.821
Imagine what he'll know by fifty.

03:10.830 --> 03:12.240
Hope you like chocolate.

03:15.580 --> 03:16.706
Agent Hotchner?

03:16.710 --> 03:17.870
You blew wax on the cake, man.

03:17.880 --> 03:18.949
Sorry.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.076
Let's cut this bad boy.
JJ: Okay.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.071
...there was _ _
another car bomb today, this time...

03:24.080 --> 03:26.287
-You having fun?
-Yes. Definitely.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.030
I am definitely having fun.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.246
Make a wish?

03:29.250 --> 03:30.660
Can I take this hat off?

03:30.670 --> 03:32.661
...but reports suggest
that the death toll

03:32.670 --> 03:34.661
-may well rise above fifty.-I wouldn't.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.706
Most of them are civilians...

03:36.710 --> 03:39.031
Hey, Spence.
First piece for the birthday boy.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.417
The car was parked
in the middle of the...

03:41.420 --> 03:44.821
Did you know she's the only person in
the whole world who calls me Spence?

03:44.830 --> 03:46.377
There's cherry in it.

03:46.380 --> 03:47.870
...but is thought to be the work of
a splinter group.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.029
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.667
Birthday boy.

03:50.670 --> 03:51.785
Did everyone get some?

03:51.790 --> 03:53.075
JJ, why don't you feed it to him?

03:53.080 --> 03:54.286
Yes, thank you.
-Sorry, guys.

03:54.290 --> 03:55.575
Party's over.

04:00.540 --> 04:04.078
-We're going to San Diego.
-But not for the surfing, huh?

04:04.080 --> 04:05.536
They're calling him the "Tommy Killer."

04:05.540 --> 04:07.917
Six women raped and murdered
in their homes in the last three weeks.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.571
-Six in three weeks?
-That's a short fuse.

04:10.580 --> 04:12.912
And getting shorter.
First two were eight days apart,

04:12.920 --> 04:15.571
-then the next four in _two weeks.
-RapId escalation.

04:15.580 --> 04:18.037
You think he's regressing
to a psychopathic frenzy?

04:18.040 --> 04:19.917
No, he's too controlled for that.

04:22.540 --> 04:23.746
See you on the plane.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.615
Why the "Tommy Killer"?

04:26.620 --> 04:28.781
You know the rock opera?

04:28.790 --> 04:32.282
Well, this UnSub glues
his victims' eyes wide open.

04:39.920 --> 04:43.788
-He wants them to see him.
-And feel him.

05:18.710 --> 05:21.110
French poet Jacques Rigaut said,

05:21.120 --> 05:23.827
"Don't forget that I cannot see myself,

05:23.830 --> 05:28.199
"that my role is limited to being
the one who looks in the mirror."

05:29.670 --> 05:31.956
Brenda Samms was found yesterday
by her children

05:31.960 --> 05:33.825
when they got home from school.

05:33.830 --> 05:37.038
She had been strangled
with a thin ligature, possibly a wire.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.996
No weapon left at the scene.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.536
Residue on the wrists and mouth

05:40.540 --> 05:42.952
indicate that duct tape was used,
then removed.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.497
-Also not found at the scene.
-Brought it with him, took it with him.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.458
He also started leaving messages
at the fourth scene,

05:49.290 --> 05:51.918
this was on the mirrors.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.662
"Fair lady,
throw those costly robes aside,

05:54.670 --> 05:57.116
"No longer may you glory in your pride,

05:57.120 --> 05:59.372
"Take leave of _
all your carnal vain delight..."

05:59.380 --> 06:02.031
"I've come to summon you away
this night."

06:03.080 --> 06:05.822
It's a ballad from the late 16005.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.786
A Dialogue Betwixt Death and a Lady..,

06:07.790 --> 06:10.247
A seventeenth-century ballad?

06:10.250 --> 06:13.208
Yeah, essentially a woman begging
Death to live.

06:13.210 --> 06:14.825
What kind of person
knows this ballad?

06:14.830 --> 06:17.162
Are we looking for a literature professor?

06:17.170 --> 06:19.786
Well, anyone with
an Internet connection, actually.

06:19.790 --> 06:21.667
You should see what comes in
when you type the word "death"

06:21.670 --> 06:23.410
into a search engine.

06:23.420 --> 06:24.876
Reid, no wonder you can't get a date.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.997
Reid, you stay on the messages.
See if there's a deeper meaning.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.616
Well, it definitely looks like he
ransacked the crime scene pretty well.

06:30.620 --> 06:33.327
-A lot of damage, nothing taken.
-Well, the eyes are the thing.

06:33.330 --> 06:35.616
The signature.
The behavior that isn't necessary

06:35.620 --> 06:38.919
for the murder, but necessary
for the emotional release.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.615
That's what he's there for.

06:40.620 --> 06:44.249
There used to be a widely held belief
that the eyes record a snapshot

06:44.250 --> 06:46.115
of the last thing a person sees
before they die.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.496
Yeah, that's right.
People used to write poems

06:47.500 --> 06:49.912
-about talking to Death.
-Ballads.

06:50.380 --> 06:51.574
Whatever.

06:52.330 --> 06:54.912
You think they'll ever run out
of new things to do to their victims?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.707
Well, finding new ways to hurt
each other is what we're good at.

07:25.290 --> 07:29.909
Task Force Headquarters
SAN DIEGO POLICE DEPARTMENT

07:40.750 --> 07:42.456
Captain Griffith, Task Force Commander.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.030
Sorry. We all get tunnel vision.

07:44.040 --> 07:46.702
Um, I'm Special Agent Hotchner.
This is Agent Jareau, our liaison.

07:46.710 --> 07:47.916
-Hi.
-I appreciate you coming out.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.286
Thanks. Hope we can help.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.740
Hi.
You've reached the Chandlers.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.412
Leave a message,
and have a beautiful day.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.321
What a good soccer game!
I'm so proud of you.

08:15.330 --> 08:16.991
When's Mommy coming in?

08:22.250 --> 08:24.957
Happy anniversary, honey.
Love you.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.417
Ready for bed, Mom!
Will you tuck me in?

08:27.420 --> 08:29.615
This UnSub glues
his victims' eyes wide open.

08:29.620 --> 08:30.826
They're calling him
the "Tommy Killer."

08:30.830 --> 08:33.116
It definitely looks like he
ransacked the crime scene pretty well.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.917
Do you have a lot of
homework, sweetie?

08:34.920 --> 08:38.538
Mom Mom, where are you?

08:43.040 --> 08:46.248
"You may as well be mute,
there is no time..."

08:46.500 --> 08:48.491
Creepy, huh?

08:48.750 --> 08:52.322
Actually, conversations
between Death and his victims

08:52.330 --> 08:55.822
was a fairly popular literary
and artistic theme throughout

08:55.830 --> 08:57.878
the Renaissance.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.207
Yeah. Creepy.

09:06.540 --> 09:09.782
He strikes during the day
in upper-middle-class neighborhoods.

09:09.790 --> 09:13.419
Extremely high-risk victims
at a high-risk time.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.706
He's confident in his ability.

09:17.330 --> 09:19.958
_ Looks to be about_
a five-square-mlle radIus.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.702
So he probably has a vehicle.

09:22.710 --> 09:24.780
Do you want to see that crime scene?

09:26.120 --> 09:28.702
It's still taped off.
The husband won't go back inside.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.075
Let's go.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.707
All right.
So we need answers to these questions.

09:33.710 --> 09:35.996
What does the evidence tell you
about the sexual aspect?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.412
What kind of rapist is he
independent of the homicides?

09:38.420 --> 09:39.819
I'm on it.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.457
It looks like what he's written
at the scenes

09:41.460 --> 09:43.917
are most of the first three verses
of the same ballad.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.205
Most of?

09:45.210 --> 09:46.780
Yeah, it's only one part
of the conversation.,

09:46.790 --> 09:48.781
There's no "betwixt."

09:50.250 --> 09:52.878
Uh, Death speaks,
but the lady never answers.

09:52.880 --> 09:56.668
Maybe he feels like
their bodies are answer enough.

10:10.380 --> 10:11.745
Very nice.

10:30.920 --> 10:34.071
-This profiling really works?
-It's a tool.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.117
You can tell all about a guy
from looking at the scene?

10:37.120 --> 10:40.704
Well, the scene's only part of it.
We also use victimology for precedent.

10:40.710 --> 10:43.326
We can usually get
a fairly clear picture of the guy.

10:43.330 --> 10:45.662
Our guys went over it pretty well.

10:45.670 --> 10:47.456
I'm sure they did.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.743
Local officers aren't trained to look
for the things we look for.

10:51.750 --> 10:56.039
_ -What_'s that?
-Hate, Insecurity, fear, anger.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.669
-That's all at the scene?
-It's all in his behavior.

11:00.580 --> 11:02.457
You know anything about our guy yet?

11:02.460 --> 11:06.328
Yeah, he isn't going to stop
until he's caught.

11:33.580 --> 11:35.207
You increased patrols
in these neighborhoods

11:35.210 --> 11:37.747
-when a pattern was identified?
-After the fourth victim.

11:37.750 --> 11:40.378
-Boss has canceled days off, vacations.

11:40.380 --> 11:42.666
Neighborhood full of cruisers
and he still struck two more times.

11:42.670 --> 11:43.819
He blends. Gideon.

11:43.830 --> 11:46.492
There may have been another attempt
six blocks from the station house.

11:46.500 --> 11:47.660
-Attempt?-The husband interrupted

11:47.670 --> 11:48.876
and the attacker got away,

11:48.880 --> 11:50.370
but Elle and I are headed over
there right now.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.200
Well, we're already at
the last crime scene.

11:52.210 --> 11:55.452
-Let us know if you identify a suspect.
-Suspect?

11:55.460 --> 11:58.748
Might have been another attack
not far from your station.

11:58.750 --> 12:02.538
-Hey, hey, hey, hey! Where you going?
-Over there.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.781
Well, units are already heading that way.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.371
We can get more accomplished here.

12:06.380 --> 12:08.075
No.

12:08.080 --> 12:11.459
If there's an arrest, what we find here
will help you prosecute.

12:12.250 --> 12:13.706
This scene won't be pristine forever.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.492
-Guys, knock yourselves out.
-Thank you.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.741
Hey, wait a minute.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.071
The UnSub went through the back, right?

12:24.080 --> 12:26.742
The family room.
It's the window full of print dust.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.706
Gideon! I'm going around the house.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.202
Okay, not that easy to manoeuvre.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.207
That means I'm a little bit athletic.

13:42.210 --> 13:43.529
All right.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.241
He messed with something in here.

13:50.670 --> 13:52.114
Broken cappuccino machine.

13:53.540 --> 13:55.531
Took the appliances which are upstairs.

13:55.540 --> 13:57.076
Why?

13:58.460 --> 13:59.870
Why would I take the time?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.825
Luclq woman.

14:08.830 --> 14:12.209
Yeah, well, she's probably not feeling
so luclq right about now.

14:12.210 --> 14:15.702
You're absolutely sure about that,
Mr. Gordon?

14:15.710 --> 14:20.113
He was black and six feet tall.
I watched him run out that back door.

14:21.830 --> 14:24.321
Get a description out in the field ASAP.

14:28.790 --> 14:31.611
Interracial serial sex crimes are rare.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.918
-Are they impossible?
-Uh,no.

14:34.460 --> 14:35.916
Then what's your point?

14:35.920 --> 14:37.706
Only to provide you with information.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.072
-I'm going to go talk to her.
-May I ask why?

14:44.080 --> 14:46.662
She's surrounded by men.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.326
Mrs. Gordon? I'm Elle.

14:52.330 --> 14:53.877
Would you like to go outside?

14:55.880 --> 14:58.417
It's all right.
We're just going to go some place quiet.

15:15.830 --> 15:18.458
Here's where I got the china.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.569
The silver.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.871
I didn't take it. I broke it.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.530
Why wouldn't she hear me?

15:32.250 --> 15:33.990
Because I did it after.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.202
"You may as well be mute.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.828
"There is no time at all for vain dispute,

15:46.830 --> 15:50.869
"Your riches, gold and garments,
jewels bright,.

15:50.880 --> 15:56.238
"Your house and land,
must on new owners light."

15:58.830 --> 16:00.786
I really don't know that much about him.

16:00.790 --> 16:02.200
Well, you don't have to.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.917
Just take a little time
to collect your thoughts.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.377
To just sit here. Breathe.

16:08.380 --> 16:11.326
-You don't want to ask me questions?
-Not until you're ready.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.615
I'll be right behind that doorway.

16:21.620 --> 16:24.202
I didn't even know he was in the house.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.111
Is that common?

16:31.170 --> 16:32.285
Very.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.912
She had a workout video on.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.829
-Step aerobics.
-Step aerobics

16:44.380 --> 16:46.325
Step up, step down,
step up, step down?

16:46.330 --> 16:47.991
Where's the platform?

16:56.330 --> 16:59.663
-He spent a lot of time here.
-What, so he vacuumed?

17:00.710 --> 17:04.032
-There's no marks from the platforms.
-Lot of time.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.371
The broken things.

17:07.380 --> 17:09.701
She must have already been dead
or incapacitated when he did that.

17:09.710 --> 17:13.032
Cappuccino maker from the kitchen,
dishes, vases, broken jewelry.,

17:13.040 --> 17:14.416
Symbols.

17:15.040 --> 17:19.409
"Your riches, gold, garments,
jewels bright,

17:19.420 --> 17:23.572
"Your house and land,
must on new owners light."

17:24.920 --> 17:27.662
-Her riches.
-Right.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.707
Ever feel like there's something
obvious right in front of you,

17:30.710 --> 17:32.371
you just can't see it?

17:32.380 --> 17:34.029
Yeah, usually right before
a woman dumps me.

17:36.540 --> 17:39.532
He slapped me from behind,
and pulled me down on the floor.

17:39.540 --> 17:43.874
I tried to scratch him and bite him,
but he was so strong.

17:43.880 --> 17:47.327
And then my husband came home
from work.

17:47.330 --> 17:51.573
He screamed,
and the man ran out the door.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.036
He was a black man?

17:54.670 --> 17:57.912
Bill was sure of it, but I...,

17:57.920 --> 17:59.820
I only remember his eyes.

18:00.670 --> 18:04.413
When we were fighting,
I kept staring him right in the eyes.

18:04.420 --> 18:08.072
I remember thinking,
if he's going to kill me,

18:08.080 --> 18:12.039
then he's going to have to look at me
while he does.

18:13.120 --> 18:18.285
And he just kept staring back at me
through the ski mask..

18:19.880 --> 18:21.609
-A ski mask?
-Yeah.

18:27.290 --> 18:30.669
It's all right. You did good.

18:36.670 --> 18:38.661
-The verses.
-Found something?

18:38.670 --> 18:40.319
Uh, not an answer, a question.

18:40.330 --> 18:43.163
I found the full_ text.
He's pretty much followmg It to a tee,

18:43.170 --> 18:45.286
at least the,
the Death side of the conversation.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.450
But?

18:46.460 --> 18:48.530
Why didn't he leave them at the first
three murders?

18:48.540 --> 18:51.828
I mean, this ballad is ten verses long,
just on the Death side.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.286
He's got plenty to work with.

18:53.290 --> 18:54.780
But if it's not a part of his signature,

18:54.790 --> 18:57.076
if it isn't something that he has to do
for an emotional reason,

18:57.080 --> 18:58.877
then, I mean, why start?

19:03.080 --> 19:07.824
JJ, find out when the press
ran the first story on this UnSub.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.661
-When?
-After which victim.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.035
Yeah, you got it.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.873
-What are you thinking?
-He wasn't getting enough attention.

19:13.880 --> 19:15.609
Police departments sometimes
don't even realize

19:15.620 --> 19:17.611
-they're looking at a pattern.
-Yeah, until somebody tells them.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.577
The first story ran the morning
after the fourth victim was found.

19:21.580 --> 19:24.242
The increased patrols didn't begin
until after the fourth victim, either.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.786
Yeah, the police didn't realize
what was happening.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.668
-He writes his verse...
-Everyone knows that he was there.

19:28.670 --> 19:30.911
The offender in this new attempt
is a black male.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.706
Black male That doesn't happen.

19:32.710 --> 19:34.996
How about Herbert Mullin?
He killed fourteen different people

19:35.000 --> 19:36.820
of completely varying ages,
races and creeds.

19:36.830 --> 19:39.071
But there was no sexual component
to his crimes.

19:39.080 --> 19:43.323
And he wore a ski mask.
This attacker wore a ski mask.

19:47.380 --> 19:50.201
-Tell them we're ready.
-For a profile?

19:51.460 --> 19:53.951
And to make Tommy contact us.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.668
The UnSub brought his weapons with him.

20:06.540 --> 20:09.031
Tape, glue, wire.

20:12.830 --> 20:15.492
He did not leave them at the scene.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.616
He took them when he left.

20:18.670 --> 20:22.288
He has a kind of killing kit
that he carries.

20:22.580 --> 20:26.072
Organized killers usually have
a skilled job, likely technology related,

20:26.080 --> 20:28.162
which may involve the use of the hands.

20:28.170 --> 20:31.037
The crime scenes are far enough apart
that he needs a vehicle.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.783
This will be well-kept,
obsessively clean, as will be his home.

20:34.790 --> 20:36.917
He's diurnal,
the attacks occur during the day,

20:36.920 --> 20:38.615
so the vehicle may be related to his work,

20:38.620 --> 20:40.417
possibly a company car or truck.

20:40.420 --> 20:42.615
We believe he watches the victims
for a time,

20:42.620 --> 20:44.872
learns the rhythms of the home,
knows his time frame.

20:45.920 --> 20:48.206
You're not going to
catch him accidentally.

20:48.920 --> 20:51.707
He destroys symbols of wealth
in the victims' homes.

20:55.750 --> 21:00.870
He harbors envy of and hatred toward
people of a higher social class.

21:01.420 --> 21:02.739
He feels invisible around them.

21:02.750 --> 21:07.073
Class is the theme of the poem which
he left at the various crime scenes.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.537
At one point in the poem,
the woman attempts to bribe Death,

21:09.540 --> 21:10.666
but he doesn't accept it.

21:10.670 --> 21:13.958
He says this is the one moment
when riches mean nothing.

21:13.960 --> 21:17.032
When Death comes,
poor and the rich are exactly alike.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.531
Probably middle-class.

21:19.540 --> 21:21.667
A decidedly lower-class person would

21:21.670 --> 21:23.490
stick out in a highly
patrolled neighborhood.

21:23.500 --> 21:26.572
This guy appears to belong there.
He blends in.

21:26.580 --> 21:31.415
-Why does he glue the eyes open?
-The UnSub is an exploitative rapist.

21:31.420 --> 21:35.038
Most rape victims close their eyes
during the attack, turn their heads.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.873
For some rapists, this ruins the fantasy.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.701
For this type of rapist,
the goal is more related

21:40.710 --> 21:43.998
to the victim watching him
than the act itself.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.571
The verses, the staging,
the aggressive language,

21:46.580 --> 21:47.740
"I am Death."

21:47.750 --> 21:50.207
This is a guy who, while being
in control at the crime scene,

21:50.210 --> 21:53.202
almost certainly feels inadequate
in the rest of his life.

21:53.210 --> 21:56.327
That's why he couldn't wait for you
to figure out what he'd done.

21:56.330 --> 21:59.493
Why he needed to make sure
all his crimes were counted.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.740
His victims.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.820
They represent whatever
it is that's controlling him,

22:02.830 --> 22:05.378
and he wants that control back.

22:05.380 --> 22:07.746
He is under the thumb of a powerful woman

22:07.750 --> 22:09.160
who frightens him.

22:10.380 --> 22:14.111
And a final point, he is white.

22:14.790 --> 22:18.282
We have witnesses that identify him
as a black male.

22:18.290 --> 22:22.203
The attacker was black.
He is not the Tommy Killer.

22:22.210 --> 22:25.168
Mrs. Gordon's husband came home
at the same tIme that he always does.

22:25.170 --> 22:26.614
The Tommy Killer would have known that.

22:26.620 --> 22:29.327
And Mrs. Gordon's attacker
wore a Skl mask.

22:29.330 --> 22:31.571
The UnSub knows when he walks into a house

22:31.580 --> 22:34.208
he's going to kill the woman
who lives there.

22:35.210 --> 22:37.326
If you're not leaving any witnesses,
why wear a ski mask?

22:37.330 --> 22:39.378
And he wants the victim
to see him anyway.

22:39.380 --> 22:41.951
Your attempted rapist is a garden-variety,

22:41.960 --> 22:43.496
disorganized young man.

22:43.500 --> 22:47.709
As the victim's age goes up,
generally the attacker's age goes down.

22:47.710 --> 22:50.918
Mrs. Gordon is about sixty,
which puts her rapist at about twenty.

22:50.920 --> 22:54.822
And it takes years to develop the
level of calm and sophistication

22:54.830 --> 22:57.037
that Tommy displays at a crime scene.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.372
And the rapist is far too young for that.

22:59.380 --> 23:01.575
Mrs. Gordon told me that
there's a young man

23:01.580 --> 23:03.912
who delivers groceries to their home.

23:04.540 --> 23:06.576
He fits a lot of what
we're describing here.

23:06.580 --> 23:07.820
Great.

23:07.830 --> 23:10.412
Not at all.

23:10.420 --> 23:12.490
May I see you in your office
for a moment?

23:15.040 --> 23:18.032
-You have a tip line for the public?
-Yes.

23:18.500 --> 23:21.742
We have a technician at Quantico
who can tap into your phone system.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.069
He's going to call us?

23:23.080 --> 23:25.617
Well, he's gone out of his way
to show you how scary he is.

23:25.620 --> 23:28.703
00 news leads with
the capture of a six-foot-tall black man

23:28.710 --> 23:32.419
in connection with his crimes,
he's going to be furious.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.661
Furious enough to call.

23:35.210 --> 23:37.166
Later, man. See you.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.285
FBI, you're under arrest.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.991
You're under arrest for
the attempted rape of MarCIa Gordon.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.410
What?

23:51.380 --> 23:54.872
The FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit
was called in yesterday afternoon

23:54.880 --> 23:57.826
by the San Diego Police Department
to assist in the ongoing

23:57.830 --> 23:58.990
Tommy Killer investigation.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.740
The unit is headed...

24:05.460 --> 24:08.782
I can now announce _that our office
has assrsted In making an arrest

24:08.790 --> 24:11.873
in connection with the investigation.
That's all I can say at this time..

24:14.210 --> 24:16.997
He confessed to Mrs. Gordon's attack
before we even got to the car.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.240
Thanks, Elle.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.911
00 news.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.035
Did they get good footage?

24:21.040 --> 24:22.325
Yeah, couldn't miss him.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.378
-Good. Now we wait.
-Call Garcia.

24:25.670 --> 24:27.911
Go for Miss Penelope Garcia.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.239
Ready with the trap and trace?

24:29.250 --> 24:32.117
Peaches, this is the
Office of Unmitigated Superiority.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.702
I am always ready.
With the awesome power

24:34.710 --> 24:37.247
I have in this room, all I need
is fifteen seconds on the phone

24:37.250 --> 24:40.538
-to nail this skeevy perv.-Fifteen seconds?

24:40.540 --> 24:42.201
If that.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.457
I can now announce
that our office has assrsted

24:48.460 --> 24:51.372
in making an arrest
in connection with the investigation.

24:51.380 --> 24:53.746
That's really all I can say at this time.
Thank you.

24:53.750 --> 24:56.378
Turn that damn television down.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.411
Sorry.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.706
We're still waiting, Garcia.

25:17.620 --> 25:20.111
God, I hate waiting like this.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.702
Do you think it's weird
that I knew that ballad?

25:23.960 --> 25:27.748
I don't know how it is that you know
half the things you know,

25:27.750 --> 25:28.876
but I'm glad you do.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.075
Do you think that's why
I can't get a date?

25:31.540 --> 25:33.747
Do you ever ask anyone out?

25:34.040 --> 25:36.702
-No.
-That's why you can't get a date.

25:39.710 --> 25:44.079
Detective Martin.
Hey, hey! Pick it up, pick it up.

25:44.420 --> 25:46.741
Line six, Penelope. Line six.

25:47.290 --> 25:50.919
You stupid
incompetent sons of bitches!

25:50.920 --> 25:53.115
I don't make mistakes!

25:53.120 --> 25:56.874
I am Death! You hear me?
I am Death!

25:56.880 --> 25:59.110
You'll see now. Tomorrow.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.748
Mark my words, you will see!.

26:02.710 --> 26:05.918
And while I'm taking her,
I'm going to be thinking of you!

26:07.830 --> 26:09.206
Anything?

26:09.210 --> 26:10.416
Are you kidding me?

26:10.420 --> 26:12.160
I... Look,
I don't know how this is possible,

26:12.170 --> 26:14.491
because there was definitely
enough time for me to get a location,

26:14.500 --> 26:16.991
but I got nothing.
I got absolutely nothing.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.240
Let me work on this.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.161
-She said she got nothing.
-Nothing?

26:20.170 --> 26:21.376
We missed him?

26:41.790 --> 26:44.111
We have an undercover car
for each of your teams

26:44.120 --> 26:46.998
and the entire damned department
out there, too.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.743
Remember, a truck, maybe a
work truck in excellent condition.

26:50.750 --> 26:52.160
Everyone knows.

26:52.710 --> 26:54.200
All right.
He might make a mistake today.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.997
He's angry and he probably hasn't
done the kind of surveillance he'd like.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.537
Yeah, well, neither have we.
Let's go, Reid.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.701
I'll bring the car around.

27:05.710 --> 27:07.280
We'll find him.

27:45.420 --> 27:49.709
This is the last place he watched.
That house.

27:50.250 --> 27:53.287
Morgan said the family
hasn't moved back in.

27:54.080 --> 27:55.877
Probably never will.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.780
It's the eyes.

27:59.790 --> 28:01.326
Excuse me?

28:01.330 --> 28:03.958
It's the eyes, Elle.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.377
There's something
not right about the eyes.

28:07.380 --> 28:09.610
If you mean what he does to them,
yeah, I agree.

28:09.620 --> 28:13.374
No...it's almost_a classic move
for an exp|0itative rapist

28:13.380 --> 28:15.746
-to force the victim to watch.
-But?

28:18.790 --> 28:20.200
We're missing something about it.

28:35.790 --> 28:37.326
30 already.

28:37.330 --> 28:40.959
All he said was tomorrow,
he didn't specify morning.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.417
Reid, this guy's got to spend
a lot of time in that house.

28:43.420 --> 28:45.911
A lot.
He needs it to be morning.

28:48.500 --> 28:49.910
Are we sure this is a good spot?

28:49.920 --> 28:52.377
Three of the victims lived within
a block of this street.

28:52.380 --> 28:53.779
It's the main artery through
the neighborhood.

28:53.790 --> 28:55.610
True, but three victims
in the same block

28:55.620 --> 28:57.702
could mean he's done with the area.

28:57.710 --> 28:59.780
Or that he's just really familiar with it.

28:59.790 --> 29:01.826
And comfortable in it.

29:01.830 --> 29:04.378
But then on the other hand,
the other victims lived more than a mile

29:04.380 --> 29:06.496
-in either direction.
-Right.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.616
God, I hate not having a plan.

29:08.620 --> 29:10.372
We're looking for a needle
in a haystack here.,

29:11.330 --> 29:15.118
Actually it's more like we're looking
for a needle in a pile of needles.

29:16.670 --> 29:17.876
What?

29:17.880 --> 29:19.950
A needle would stand out in a haystack.

29:21.620 --> 29:24.999
Okay. And we're not looking
for someone who stands out.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.913
No, we're looking for a particular needle
in a pile of needles.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.662
-Can I help you folks with something?
-FBI.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.877
Oh. Sorry.

30:00.790 --> 30:03.497
After the fourth killing, PD doubled
the patrols in these neighborhoods.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.491
Then doubled them again
after the fifth and sixth.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.536
Yet our UnSub still watched the houses.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.702
How can he not have been seen?

30:13.500 --> 30:14.660
Is that an oriole?

30:16.170 --> 30:18.707
No, black-headed grosbeak.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.910
Grosbeak?

30:23.080 --> 30:25.321
Grosbeak, too. Female.

30:27.670 --> 30:31.379
Orson Welles said, "All the birds who
belong to our sex have prettier feathers

30:31.380 --> 30:34.998
"because males have got to try
to justify their existence."

30:35.000 --> 30:36.956
We spend all our time screaming,

30:38.080 --> 30:41.993
"Look at me, look at me. Mommy,
Mommy. Look at me."

30:42.000 --> 30:43.035
Yeah?

30:46.460 --> 30:48.917
-Twenty-five?
-Look at me...

30:48.920 --> 30:50.160
Okay.

30:51.420 --> 30:54.036
Garcia couldn't get a fix on the call
because it was routed through

30:54.040 --> 30:57.112
-twenty-five different substations.
-Twenty-five substations.

31:00.540 --> 31:03.748
-He wanted them to see him.
-We established that.

31:12.710 --> 31:16.373
He's meticulous.
Nothing is an accident.

31:16.380 --> 31:18.075
He vacuumed.

31:19.040 --> 31:23.249
The scene is about domination.
His creation.

31:23.620 --> 31:27.499
He positioned everything
exactly the way he wanted it.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.161
And?

31:32.000 --> 31:35.618
If the eyes were so
they could watch the attack,

31:35.620 --> 31:38.418
why are they all facing away from it?

31:38.790 --> 31:41.167
In that position
they couldn't see him during.

31:43.790 --> 31:46.111
He wanted them to see him afterward.

31:52.210 --> 31:53.950
Office of Unfettered Omniscience.

31:53.960 --> 31:57.077
Penelope Garcia is in.
Speak, O fortunate one.

31:57.080 --> 31:58.707
Garcia, it's Elle.

31:58.710 --> 32:01.247
Can you get into
the phone repair records in San Diego?

32:01.250 --> 32:03.992
Sunshine,
I can run CentCom from here,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.207
and still participate
in simultaneous Tetris tournaments.

32:06.210 --> 32:07.746
I'm looking for repairmen

32:07.750 --> 32:10.537

in San Diego.

32:10.540 --> 32:12.451
It could be as much as
four or five days prior.

32:12.460 --> 32:13.825
See if there are any common names.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.115

-What you got?
-He's a phone technician, Hotch.

32:22.710 --> 32:24.951
The police are looking for someone
walking around a neighborhood

32:24.960 --> 32:27.201
in broad daylight. Who notices
a phone guy up on a pole?

32:27.210 --> 32:28.825
He can watch
for husbands leaving for work,

32:28.830 --> 32:31.412
watch for police patrols,
know when the neighbourhood's quiet.

32:31.420 --> 32:32.819
He knows when
he will have plenty of time.

32:32.830 --> 32:34.878
He can even tap into a phone line
to make sure someone's home.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.496
How about routing a call
through twenty-five substations?

32:37.500 --> 32:39.707
Backyard, hey,
he's just looking for a pole.

32:39.710 --> 32:42.372

-I'|| shoot her.
-No, you won't, Franklin.

37:14.540 --> 37:16.110
Yes, I will.

37:16.120 --> 37:17.667
If you hurt her, I'll kill you.

37:17.670 --> 37:20.161
I'll just say we caught
a low-life burglar.

37:20.170 --> 37:21.910
You didn't turn out to be
Tommy after all.

37:23.790 --> 37:25.781
He will remain uncaught.

37:26.790 --> 37:28.872
After awhile, people will forget you.
You'll be nothing.

37:30.170 --> 37:32.741
Once every five or ten years
they'll do a TV show and they'll ask,

37:32.750 --> 37:33.990
"Whatever happened to that 'Tommy' guy?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.536
"Why did he disappear?"

37:35.540 --> 37:37.576
And then they'll stop talking
about it altogether.

37:39.330 --> 37:43.073
Put the gun down.
Come on, walk out of here with me.

37:43.080 --> 37:45.321
I'll make sure your face
is splashed across

37:45.330 --> 37:47.821
every newspaper and TV in the country.

37:47.830 --> 37:51.709
"Tommy Killer," Franklin Graney.
Everyone will see you then.

37:52.330 --> 37:54.958
Bundy, Dahmer, Graney,

37:54.960 --> 37:56.279
the whole world'll know who you are.

37:57.580 --> 37:59.878
It's up to you, Franklin.

37:59.880 --> 38:03.782
You can be famous,
or you can be invisible.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.199
You'll tell everyone?

38:09.790 --> 38:12.076
I have a media specialist
outside right now.

It is your choice.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.457

38:54.620 --> 38:56.611
Rose Kennedy once said,

38:56.620 --> 39:00.283
"Birds sing after a storm,
why shouldn't people feel

39:00.290 --> 39:04.784
"as free to delight in whatever
sunlight remains to them?"

39:20.790 --> 39:22.997
Oh, I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.787
-Oh, yeah?
-I forgot to give it to you at the party.

39:27.460 --> 39:30.372

39:41.620 --> 39:44.748
-Wow. The Redskins.
-It's a VIP box.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.992
Wow. Thank you so much.

Ever been to a pro football game?

39:50.460 --> 39:53.827
No, I honestly didn't know
this was football.

39:54.420 --> 39:57.662
-You're going to love it.
-We are. You're coming with me, right?

39:57.670 --> 39:58.955
No.

39:58.960 --> 40:02.111
There's someone else on the plane
who is a huge Skins fan.

40:02.120 --> 40:03.371
VVho?

40:03.380 --> 40:05.245
The only person in the world
who calls you Spence.

40:07.420 --> 40:10.241
-JJ?
-She's a huge Redskins fan.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.570
What should I say?

40:30.620 --> 40:31.666
Checkmate.

40:46.540 --> 40:50.783
Heard you're a fan of football.
