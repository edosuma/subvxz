00:01.543 --> 00:02.752
- YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHAT'S BEEN HEATING UP

00:02.836 --> 00:03.628
ON <i> HOT IN CLEVELAND.</i>
- WOW!

00:03.711 --> 00:05.130
- I'M MOVING IN
WITH MY BOYFRIEND ALEC.

00:05.213 --> 00:07.924
VICTORIA'S IN LOVE
WITH A FAMOUS MOVIE STAR.

00:08.007 --> 00:11.094
JOY GOT AN INTERNSHIP
WITH BOB, A PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.430
AND ALL SEASON LONG,
ELKA'S BEEN HIDING A BIG SECRET.

00:13.513 --> 00:14.764
- OH, MY GOD!

00:14.848 --> 00:16.599
SO THAT'S WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN SELLING!

00:16.683 --> 00:19.102
- OKAY, YOU GOT ME.

00:19.185 --> 00:20.979
NOW WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

00:21.062 --> 00:23.940
TONIGHT,<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS PERFORMED LIVE

00:24.023 --> 00:25.942
IN FRONT
OF A STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.403
SO I BETTER WATCH
MY [bleep] LANGUAGE.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.620
- [stammers]
WE ARE JUST STUNNED, ELKA.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.456
- I AM IN SHOCK.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.999
HOW COULD YOU HAVE
ALL THESE PILLS

00:41.082 --> 00:43.376
AND NOT HAVE SHARED?

00:45.545 --> 00:48.131
- SHE'S NOT TAKING THEM,
SHE'S SELLING THEM...

00:48.214 --> 00:50.884
TO SENIORS, AT A DISCOUNT.

00:50.967 --> 00:55.930
- MY PRICES ARE INSANE.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.140
- ALSO, ILLEGAL.

00:57.223 --> 01:00.059
SHE AND MAMIE SUE HAVE BEEN
SMUGGLING MEDS IN FROM CANADA

01:00.143 --> 01:01.978
FOR THEIR FRIENDS
WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEM.

01:02.061 --> 01:03.938
- YOU MEAN THESE
ARE JUST OLD PEOPLE MEDS?

01:04.022 --> 01:07.484
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BOTOX
OR WRINKLE CREAM?

01:07.567 --> 01:11.946
- THOSE ARE OLD PEOPLE MEDS
TOO, DEAR.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.948
- ELKA, I KNOW
YOU WANNA HELP YOUR FRIENDS,

01:14.032 --> 01:15.366
BUT THIS IS DANGEROUS.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.160
YOU COULD GO TO JAIL.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.870
- WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?
WE COULD ALL GO TO JAIL.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.455
WE'RE ACCESSORIES!

01:20.538 --> 01:22.540
- OH, IF ONLY
MY OSCAR-WINNING BOYFRIEND

01:22.624 --> 01:24.793
SIR EMMET LAWSON WERE HERE.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.628
- WHAT WOULD HE DO?

01:26.711 --> 01:30.173
- NOTHING.
SHE JUST LIKES SAYING IT.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.884
- I DO.
I REALLY DO.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.386
- JUST SELL EVERYTHING
YOU'VE GOT NOW,

01:35.470 --> 01:37.013
AND THEN YOU'RE DONE.

01:37.096 --> 01:38.807
- EVERYTHING?

01:38.890 --> 01:41.059
THAT...
MIGHT TAKE A WHILE.

01:41.142 --> 01:44.521
- JUST HOW MUCH MEDICINE
ARE YOU TWO SITTING ON?

01:44.604 --> 01:46.189
- WE'RE NOT SURE.

01:46.272 --> 01:50.527
MAMIE SUE'S IN THE STORM CELLAR
TAKING INVENTORY.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.862
- INVENTORY?

01:58.993 --> 02:01.412
- GOOD NEWS, MRS. GOULD.

02:01.496 --> 02:06.709
I CAN BRING YOUR HEART PILLS
WHEN WE GO SWIMMING TOMORROW.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.920
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU NEED?

02:17.178 --> 02:20.139
HAVEN'T HEARD THAT.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.392
OH, I JUST REMEMBERED.

02:22.475 --> 02:26.062
I CAN'T SWIM WITH YOU ANYMORE.

02:26.145 --> 02:29.941
BUT I WILL LOOK
FOR AN OINTMENT.

02:30.024 --> 02:32.193
- OH, MY GOD!
- UNBELIEVABLE!

02:32.277 --> 02:34.487
- MAMIE SUE,
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

02:34.571 --> 02:36.739
- THIS ISN'T
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

02:36.823 --> 02:42.328
UNLESS IT LOOKS LIKE AN ILLEGAL
PHARMACY IN YOUR STORM CELLAR.

02:42.412 --> 02:46.332
IN WHICH CASE IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

{\an8}JUST WHERE DID YOU GET
ALL THIS STUFF?

03:46.351 --> 03:50.021
{\an8}- OUR CANADIAN SUPPLIER
OFFERED US HER ENTIRE STOCK

03:50.104 --> 03:52.482
{\an8}BECAUSE SHE HAD TO FLEE
THE COUNTRY.

03:52.565 --> 03:56.486

OR BEING IMPOLITE,

THROW YOU OUT OF CANADA FOR.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.507
AND I CANNOT MOVE IN WITH ALEC

IT'S THAT SWEET BOY
WHO WON THE STATE SPELLING BEE.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.231
COME IN, TOMMY.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.525
- MORNING, LADIES.
- HI.

04:35.608 --> 04:39.153
- WOW!
LOOK AT ALL THIS!

04:39.237 --> 04:40.571
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.365
- THANK YOU.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.242
- OF COURSE,
AN ILLEGAL SETUP LIKE THIS

04:44.325 --> 04:46.035
COULD GET YOU INTO
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.662

HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.375
LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE STORY.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.584
ONCE UPON A TIME,

04:53.668 --> 04:58.089
I CONTROLLED THE BLACK MARKET
PILL BUSINESS IN CLEVELAND.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.550
BUT THEN IT SUDDENLY DRIED UP.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.886
<i>SOMEONE</i> STARTED SELLING
AT COST.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.098
- THAT MIGHT BE US.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.893
- WHEN I LOSE BUSINESS,
I GET ANGRY.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.270
WHEN I GET ANGRY,
I BURN THINGS.

05:12.353 --> 05:15.231
WHEN I BURN THINGS,
I GET HAPPY.

05:15.314 --> 05:16.899
I GOT A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.069
HOW ABOUT I TAKE ALL THIS STUFF
OFF YOUR HANDS?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.572
- WHAT IF WE SAY NO?

05:22.655 --> 05:23.948
- WELL, THAT WOULD INITIATE

05:24.032 --> 05:26.909
THE WHOLE
ANGRY-BURNING-HAPPY CYCLE.

05:26.993 --> 05:30.538
- TOMMY, YOU'RE THREATENING US
WITH ARSON?

05:30.621 --> 05:33.041
BUT YOU'RE A SPELLING BEE
CHAMPION.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.586
- AND I'VE BEEN CHASING
THAT RUSH EVER SINCE.

05:36.669 --> 05:41.257
- THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.801
- UNCONSCIONABLE?

05:43.885 --> 05:48.097
THAT'S THE WORD THAT
KNOCKED ME OUT OF NATIONALS.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.933
- IS IT?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.977
- I WAS HUMILIATED IN FRONT
OF DOZENS OF PEOPLE

05:53.061 --> 05:57.440
WATCHING ON ESPN3.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.941

06:00.818 --> 06:02.945
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
LET ME REMIND YOU.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.947
THERE'S A LOT OF OLD,
DRY THINGS IN HERE

06:05.031 --> 06:08.409
THAT COULD GO UP FAST.

TAKE THAT, JOY?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.085
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
- OH, MY GOD.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.878
WELL, I SAY WE JUST
GIVE TOMMY THE STUFF.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.171
I MEAN, IT'S BETTER
TO BE ROBBED

06:20.254 --> 06:21.839
THAN TO HAVE OUR HOUSE
GO UP IN FLAMES.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.133
- WE CAN'T.
- SHE'S RIGHT.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.136
HE'S GONNA JACK UP THE PRICES

06:27.220 --> 06:30.431

06:39.774 --> 06:41.526
LET ME REMIND YOU.

06:41.609 --> 06:45.238
I AM A CRIMINOLOGY MAJOR
AT CLEVELAND STATE.

- HERE YOU GO, SOPHIE.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.721
BEFORE TOMMY HIKES UP
THE PRICES.

- OH, I BETTER RUN.

07:12.473 --> 07:17.353
I'M GOING SWIMMING
WITH MRS. GOULD.

07:17.436 --> 07:21.482
- YOU MIGHT WANNA TAKE THESE.

07:21.566 --> 07:25.486
AND THESE.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.363
- DID YOU GET IN TOUCH
WITH BOB YET?

07:27.446 --> 07:28.364
- WHO'S BOB?

07:28.447 --> 07:29.866
- THE DETECTIVE I WORK FOR.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.534
HE'S OUT OF TOWN,

07:31.617 --> 07:34.203
{\an1}SO HE'S SENDING OVER HIS BROTHER
CLAUDE WHO'S ALSO A DETECTIVE.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.371
I'VE MET HIM.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.707
HE MAY NOT LOOK THAT SMART,

07:37.790 --> 07:39.417
OR BE THAT SMART...

07:39.500 --> 07:42.670
AND HE MAY SMELL
LIKE WET POTATOES...

07:42.753 --> 07:47.717
BUT IF MY CRIMINOLOGY INSTINCTS
ARE RIGHT...

07:47.800 --> 07:51.512
HE'S STANDING
RIGHT BEHIND ME.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.681

07:53.764 --> 07:56.726

EVERY TIME I SEE YOU.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.394

07:58.477 --> 08:00.521
- THAT YOU KNOW OF.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.902
BUT I SHOULD NOT BE FLIRTING.
YOU'RE BOB'S GIRL.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.069
- I'M NOT BOB'S GIRL.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.740
- THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAYS
IN HIS SLEEP.

08:10.823 --> 08:12.575
- YOU SHARE A ROOM
WITH YOUR BROTHER?

08:12.658 --> 08:16.245
- TWIN BEDS.
NOTHING WEIRD.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.872
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS,

08:17.955 --> 08:20.917
BUT IT LOOKS TO ME
LIKE WE'RE IN GOOD HANDS, HUH?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.419
- SO I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.630
I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH
ON THIS TOMMY,

08:25.713 --> 08:27.924
AND HE IS A BAD GUY.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.759
SO I THINK
WHAT WE NEED TO FIND

08:29.842 --> 08:33.261
IS A BIGGER BAD GUY
TO SCARE HIM OFF.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.097
- WELL, I GUESS THAT COULD WORK.
DO YOU KNOW ONE?

08:36.182 --> 08:38.643
WHO'S THE MOST FRIGHTENING
PERSON YOU CAN THINK OF?

08:38.726 --> 08:40.436
- [inhales]
NO CONTEST.

08:40.519 --> 08:45.900
SALVATORE FERULLO,
AKA SALLY FROM CINCINNATI.

08:45.983 --> 08:48.611
HE'S OHIO'S BIGGEST
CRIME BOSS,

08:48.694 --> 08:50.947
YET NO ONE HAS EVER
SEEN HIS FACE.

08:51.030 --> 08:54.116
- WELL, IF NO ONE KNOWS
WHAT THIS SALLY LOOKS LIKE,

08:54.200 --> 08:57.078
THEN HOW ABOUT WE JUST GET
SOMEONE TO PRETEND TO BE SALLY?

08:57.161 --> 08:58.829
- WAIT, HOW DO WE EXPLAIN
HOW WE KNOW HIM?

08:58.913 --> 08:59.956
- SIMPLE.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.082
WE'LL TAKE THE PLOT

09:01.165 --> 09:05.044
FROM MY LIFETIME
ORIGINAL MOVIE...

09:05.127 --> 09:09.465
<i>I'M IN LOVE</i>
<i>WITH MY BROTHER'S KILLER.</i>

09:09.548 --> 09:11.801
THE TAGLINE WAS,
"KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE

09:11.884 --> 09:15.137
AND YOUR ENEMIES...IN BED."

09:15.221 --> 09:16.973
IT WAS MY FIRST
SIDE NUDE SCENE.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.349
- [inhales]

09:18.432 --> 09:21.435
I KNEW I RECOGNIZED YOU
FROM SOMEWHERE.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.610
- HOW ABOUT WE JUST SAY
SALLY'S MY SON?

09:29.694 --> 09:30.778
- GOOD IDEA.

09:30.861 --> 09:35.032
BUT WE STILL NEED TO FIND
SOME BIG GOON TO PLAY SALLY.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.330
- WHAT?

09:41.414 --> 09:45.835
IS THERE A BIG GOON
STANDING BEHIND ME?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.476
- NERVOUS?
- NO.

10:02.560 --> 10:07.023
UNLESS YOU FIND
NERVOUSNESS SEXY.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.524
SOME WOMEN DO.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.359
OR AT LEAST,
THEY CLAIM THEY DO

10:10.443 --> 10:12.987
AND THEN THEY NEVER
CALL YOU BACK.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.572
- I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT SALLY WOULD WEAR,

10:14.655 --> 10:16.365
SO I BROUGHT YOU SOME CHOICES.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.867
- A FEDORA!

10:17.950 --> 10:20.328
I'M TOO NERVOUS
TO ROCK A FEDORA.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.038
- OKAY!

10:22.121 --> 10:23.539
OKAY, NO HATS.

10:23.622 --> 10:29.170
WE DON'T WANT TO HIDE
YOUR SEXY...SIDE HAIR.

10:30.629 --> 10:32.506
YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT!

10:32.590 --> 10:34.592
I'LL GO GET SOME MORE TEA.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.846
- SO YOU'RE AN ACTRESS.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.390
HOW DO YOU KEEP
FROM THROWING UP?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.310
- WHY WOULD I KEEP
FROM THROWING UP?

10:44.393 --> 10:48.064
OH! OH!
YOU'RE NERVOUS.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.775
WELL, UH, I THINK
THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE

10:50.858 --> 10:54.904
TO FIND SOMETHING IN THIS ROOM
THAT WILL RELAX YOU.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.323
- ARE YOU COMING ON TO ME?

11:01.160 --> 11:03.746
- CLAUDE'S A MESS,
BUT I TOOK CARE OF IT.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.582
THE OLD ALCOHOL
IN THE TEACUP TRICK.

11:06.665 --> 11:09.627
- HEARD OF IT.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.589
- CLAUDE'S A MESS,
BUT I TOOK CARE OF IT.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.758
I JUST GAVE HIM SOME PILLS.

11:15.841 --> 11:18.094
- YOU GAVE OUR GOON PILLS?

11:18.177 --> 11:20.429
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
I GAVE HIM ALCOHOL.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.265
- WELL, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THE GOON WAS LOADED?

11:23.349 --> 11:25.434
- WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU

11:25.518 --> 11:29.021
ABOUT KEEPING A LOADED GOON
IN THE HOUSE?

11:34.693 --> 11:37.238
[doorbell rings]
- OH! THAT'S TOMMY. HE'S HERE.

11:37.321 --> 11:39.448
- OKAY, I'LL GO
AND SOBER UP CLAUDE.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.908
- I'LL GET THE DOOR.

11:40.991 --> 11:44.954
- I'LL CHUG SOME MORE TEA.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.248
- HELLO, TOMMY.

11:47.331 --> 11:50.626
YOU'RE EITHER VERY BRAVE
OR VERY STUPID.

11:50.709 --> 11:54.004
SALLY FROM CINCINNATI'S
GOING TO BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.423
- YEAH, I DIDN'T BUY THAT
ON THE PHONE,

11:55.506 --> 11:57.425
AND I'M NOT BUYING IT NOW.

11:57.508 --> 12:00.970
IF SALLY WERE REALLY
YOUR KID...

12:01.053 --> 12:03.305
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
IN THE STORM CELLAR?

12:03.389 --> 12:06.308
- MAYBE I'M NOT
THE BRAGGING TYPE.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.144
- WHAT IF I SAID
I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU?

12:08.227 --> 12:12.565
- WHAT IF I SAID,
"UNCONSCIONABLE"?

12:18.028 --> 12:19.989
- CLAUDE?
CLAUDE, WHERE--

12:20.072 --> 12:22.450
[gasps]
OH, MY GOD!

12:22.533 --> 12:24.994
CLAUDE!
CLAUDE, ARE YOU DEAD?

12:25.077 --> 12:28.080
- ARE YOU COMING ON
TO ME AGAIN?

12:38.549 --> 12:41.552
- UH-HUH.
UH-HUH.

12:41.635 --> 12:44.013
- GO SEE WHAT'S TAKING VICTORIA
AND CLAUDE SO LONG.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.182
- LOOK, I GOT TWO ROIDED UP
FORMER MATHLETES

12:46.265 --> 12:49.018
HEADED OVER TO CLEAR OUT
YOUR PHARMACY.

12:49.101 --> 12:52.855
THEY WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE,
UNLIKE YOUR MYTHICAL SALLY.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.857
- UH, WAIT!

12:54.940 --> 12:57.485
MY PHONE'S VIBRATING.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.612
HELLO?

12:59.695 --> 13:03.908
IT'S YOUR SON,
SALLY FROM CINCINNATI.

13:03.991 --> 13:06.702
YOU SAY YOU'LL BE HERE
IN JUST TEN MINUTES?

13:06.785 --> 13:08.996
WELL, HURRY, ALL RIGHT?

13:09.079 --> 13:11.957

13:19.465 --> 13:21.884
IT'S YOUR SON,
SALLY FROM CINCINNATI.

13:21.967 --> 13:26.388
- THANKS FOR HURRYING.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.390
- YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE

13:28.474 --> 13:31.435
THIS SKINNY BITCH
IS SALLY FROM CINCINNATI?

13:31.519 --> 13:35.189
- FIRST, THANKS FOR THE SKINNY.

13:35.272 --> 13:38.567
BUT TRUST ME, I JUST
LET PEOPLE THINK I'M A MAN,

13:38.651 --> 13:39.568
'CAUSE THAT WAY,
THEY DON'T SEE ME COMING

13:39.652 --> 13:41.237
BUT I SEE THEM...
[imitates neck breaking]

13:41.320 --> 13:42.404
GOING.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.532
NOW YOU HAVE THREE SECONDS
TO GET YOUR ASS OUTTA HERE.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.408
ONE, TWO--

13:46.492 --> 13:51.080
- [deep voice] HEY, MA,
SORRY I'M LATE.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.373
- NO!

13:52.456 --> 13:53.415
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

13:53.499 --> 13:55.793
- SALLY FROM CINCINNATI.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.419
- NO! GO AWAY!

13:57.503 --> 14:02.091
- SCARED OF ME, HUH?
WELL, YOU OUGHT TO BE.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.594
AND YOU'RE SURPRISED
I'M A WOMAN, RIGHT?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.429
- [stammering]

14:07.513 --> 14:09.098
- WE COVERED THAT.

14:09.181 --> 14:14.311
- AS I JUST MADE CLEAR,
I AM SALLY FROM CINCINNATI.

14:14.395 --> 14:18.399
- OUT OF MY WAY!

14:18.482 --> 14:21.443
I'M SALLY FROM CINCINNATI.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.653
- OH, MY GOD.

14:22.736 --> 14:27.575
- SO YOU HAD BETTER
BE GONE...

14:27.658 --> 14:31.787
BY THE TIME I WAKE UP.

14:42.881 --> 14:45.134
- SO HOW MANY MORE BUFFOONS
ARE GONNA COME IN HERE

14:45.217 --> 14:46.969
SAYING THEY'RE
SALLY FROM CINCINNATI?

14:47.052 --> 14:50.264
- SOMEONE SAY MY NAME?

15:00.608 --> 15:02.484
- LOOK.
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.527
I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE, PAL.

15:03.611 --> 15:08.157
- I TOLD YOU WHO I WAS,
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LISTEN.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.659
I ONCE KNEW A MAN
NAMED PHIL.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.496
HE ALSO REFUSED TO LISTEN.

15:14.580 --> 15:18.751
I CARRY A SMALL SOUVENIR
OF THAT ENCOUNTER.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.002
- [gasps]

15:20.085 --> 15:22.171
IS THAT A HUMAN EAR?

15:22.254 --> 15:23.964
- PHIL HAS ONLY ONE NOW,

15:24.048 --> 15:27.384
BUT STRANGELY HIS HEARING
HAS IMPROVED.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.180
DO WE AGREE ON WHO I AM

15:31.263 --> 15:34.683
OR DO I NEED TO SHOW YOU
ANOTHER MEMENTO?

15:34.767 --> 15:37.186
I MUST WARN YOU THAT THIS ONE
COMES FROM A MAN...

15:37.269 --> 15:39.730
WHO SLEPT WITH MY SISTER.

15:39.813 --> 15:42.733
[all protesting]

15:46.945 --> 15:48.989
- UNLUCKY BASTARD!

15:49.073 --> 15:51.033
- JUDGING FROM THE SIZE
OF THE BOX,

15:51.116 --> 15:54.662
HE WASN'T THAT LUCKY
TO BEGIN WITH.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.751
- I'M A VERY PRIVATE MAN.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.711
SO IT TAKES A LOT
FOR ME TO REVEAL MYSELF.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.840
AND WHEN I HEAR
THAT SOME PILL PUSHER DAME

16:06.924 --> 16:10.552
IS CLAIMING TO BE MY MOTHER,
I GET ANGRY.

16:10.636 --> 16:15.057
AND WHEN I GET ANGRY,
I BURN THINGS.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.559
- I DO THAT!

16:17.643 --> 16:19.561
OH, I'M A BIG FAN OF YOUR WORK.
I MEANT NO DISRESPECT.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.729
- WONDERFUL.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.898
LET'S BE FACEBOOK FRIENDS.
- REALLY?

16:22.981 --> 16:26.527
- NO! I'M A MOBSTER.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

16:26.610 --> 16:30.072
YOU CAN FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.492
#BATTERYACID,

#GOBENGALS.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.747

16:38.831 --> 16:40.457
OH, AND IF MY ASSOCIATES

16:40.541 --> 16:43.961
IRA GOLDFARB AND SAM QUAN
SHOW UP WITH A U-HAUL,

16:44.044 --> 16:46.588
JUST TELL THEM THAT
"GANDALF IS <i> NOT</i> IN THE TOWER."

16:46.672 --> 16:49.258
THEY'LL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

16:49.341 --> 16:53.762
- ALL RIGHT, YOU.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.890
YOU THREE DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU COME FROM CLEVELAND.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.934
- ACTUALLY,
WE'RE FROM LOS ANGELES.

16:59.017 --> 17:00.269
- RIGHT, AND WE MOVED HERE

17:00.352 --> 17:02.104
BECAUSE WE WERE FEELING
INVISIBLE.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.772
- YEAH, MEN HAD STOPPED
LOOKING AT US.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.692
- OH, THE MEN IN L.A.
DON'T LOOK AT WOMEN

17:06.775 --> 17:07.943
IN THEIR 30S?

17:08.026 --> 17:09.069
- OH, MY GOD!

17:09.153 --> 17:10.779
- OH, YOU THINK WE'RE
IN OUR 30S?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.781
HE ACTUALLY THINKS
WE'RE IN OUR 30S.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.492
THAT IS SO VERY SWEET.
SEE, THAT'S WHY WE MOVED HERE.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.578
- OH, IT IS A GOOD REMINDER.
- YEAH.

17:17.661 --> 17:19.621
IT PUTS EVERYTHING
IN PERSPECTIVE.

17:19.704 --> 17:24.292
- KILL THEM FIRST.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.335
- OR--

17:25.419 --> 17:27.296
- YOU WANT MERCY?
TOUGH!

17:27.378 --> 17:30.424
SALLY FROM CINCINNATI
SHOWS MERCY TO NO ONE.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.176
- ELKA, DID I LEAVE
MY GLASSES HERE?

17:32.259 --> 17:34.344
[gasps]
SALVATORE!

17:34.428 --> 17:37.347
- MAMA?

17:37.431 --> 17:39.433
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:39.516 --> 17:41.101
- NOTHING.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.771
- NOTHING? NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT, HE'S SCARING US.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.814
- MY SWEET SALVATORE?

17:45.898 --> 17:48.817
- YOUR SWEET SALVATORE
IS THE BIGGEST MOBSTER IN OHIO.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.152
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

17:50.235 --> 17:54.198
- NO, SHE DIDN'T.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.158
- YOU'RE A CRIMINAL, SALLY?

17:56.241 --> 17:58.660
YOU SAID YOU WORKED FOR NPR.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.330
- I-I-I DO, MA.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.625
IT'S JUST THAT, UH, YOU DON'T
THINK THAT PUBLIC RADIO

18:04.708 --> 18:08.170
COULD PAY FOR THOSE EXPERIMENTAL
SKIN TREATMENTS, DO YOU?

18:08.253 --> 18:10.005
LOOK AT HER!

18:10.088 --> 18:12.841
108 YEARS OLD!

18:12.925 --> 18:14.843
WHAT A WOMAN!
LOOK AT THE BROAD!

18:14.927 --> 18:19.598
- HEY! YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY
STUNNING.

18:19.681 --> 18:20.808
- OH, MY GOD!

18:20.891 --> 18:22.351
SALVATORE,
DID YOU KILL THIS MAN?

18:22.434 --> 18:23.685
- NO, MA.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.187
I NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE THIS.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.522
- RIGHT, LIKE YOU NEVER SAW

18:26.605 --> 18:28.690
THOSE MAGAZINES
IN THE TOOL SHED.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.900
- MA!

18:29.983 --> 18:31.109
WHOA!

18:31.193 --> 18:34.863
- OH, I'M SO ASHAMED THAT
MY SON CAME HERE TO HURT YOU.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.824
- I DIDN'T HURT ANYONE!
BACK ME UP HERE.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.034
- OKAY, HE'S HERE TO HELP US.

18:39.117 --> 18:41.036
- I LIKE THAT.

18:41.119 --> 18:45.415
- BY BUYING OUR MEDICINE
AT A GOOD PRICE

18:45.499 --> 18:49.378
SO HE CAN GIVE IT AWAY TO ALL
THE POOR SENIORS IN CLEVELAND.

18:49.461 --> 18:52.381
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT A DEAL.

18:52.464 --> 18:55.843
- LET'S GO AND LEAVE
THESE NICE PEOPLE ALONE.

18:55.926 --> 18:59.721
- CAN WE STOP FOR ICE CREAM?
- WE'LL SEE.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.891
- THAT MEANS NO.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.401
- OH, MY GOD.

19:12.484 --> 19:16.071
WELL, THAT WAS A SERIES
OF FORTUNATE COINCIDENCES

19:16.154 --> 19:18.240
THAT FINISHED--
OH, LOOK AT THAT--

19:18.323 --> 19:21.034
RIGHT ON TIME, GIVE OR TAKE.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.745
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT MY HANDS ARE EMPTY.

19:23.829 --> 19:27.749
I FEEL LIKE
I NEED A MARTINI.

19:27.833 --> 19:28.917
- OH, BOY, YOU KNOW,

19:29.001 --> 19:30.419
SOMETIMES I WAS
A LITTLE NERVOUS TONIGHT.

19:30.502 --> 19:34.423
I ALMOST FORGOT
WHAT I HAD TO SAY.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.924
- I THINK YOU DID GREAT.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.594
AND I THINK
YOU CAN TAKE A BOW.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.762
- I THINK WE COULD ALL
TAKE A BOW.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.390
- YES.
- SOMEONE SAY, "TAKE A BOW"?

19:43.473 --> 19:48.145
[cheers and applause]

19:58.697 --> 20:01.116
- BRAVO!
- BRAVO!

20:10.584 --> 20:12.502
- WE DID IT!
WE DID IT!

20:12.586 --> 20:15.255
- WE DID IT!

20:22.387 --> 20:25.599
- NO, YOU DID IT!

20:25.682 --> 20:27.142
- NO, STAY!

20:27.225 --> 20:30.145
- STAY.
THEY WANT US ALL TO STAY, STAY.

20:30.228 --> 20:31.230
- GOOD JOB.
