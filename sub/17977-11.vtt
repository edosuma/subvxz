15:42.133 --> 15:43.167
What's the kid's name?

15:43.200 --> 15:45.067
>Angelica.

15:45.067 --> 15:46.533
>Angelica.

15:46.567 --> 15:48.867
You were Angelica's
intended parent

15:48.900 --> 15:50.067
from conception.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.633
You've actively co-parented her,

15:52.667 --> 15:54.433
and you and Tina
filed the adoption petition

15:54.467 --> 15:56.167
at the time of her birth.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.300
A California court

15:57.333 --> 15:59.567
would almost certainly
grant the adoption

15:59.600 --> 16:02.400
and award you
50/50 joint custody.

16:02.433 --> 16:03.967
>That's not what I want.

16:04.067 --> 16:05.467
I don't want
50/50 joint custody.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.067
>Oh, please, don't tell me

16:07.100 --> 16:08.500
you're trying
to get out of child support.

16:08.533 --> 16:10.200
Because
even if Tina

16:10.233 --> 16:11.433
has to raise
this baby alone,

16:11.467 --> 16:12.700
you still have
a financial obligation--

16:12.733 --> 16:16.667
>I want sole custody.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.733
>How do you figure that?

16:20.767 --> 16:22.567
>Tina may have
given birth to her,

16:22.600 --> 16:24.333
but, really, Angelica
is the mirror of me.

16:24.367 --> 16:27.267
I mean, I know
what she's going to experience

16:27.300 --> 16:30.133
as a biracial girl
growing up in a divisive world.

16:30.167 --> 16:31.233
I mean, let's face it,

16:31.267 --> 16:33.800
when Tina goes out in public
with Angelica,

16:33.833 --> 16:36.700
people automatically assume
that she's been adopted,

16:36.733 --> 16:41.300
but when they see me
with Angelica,

16:41.333 --> 16:44.533
they see a mother
and a daughter.

16:44.567 --> 16:46.100
I'm the one who's going
to be able to give her

16:46.133 --> 16:47.800
a sense of belonging.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.133
>Wow.

16:49.167 --> 16:53.233
Okay, um...

16:53.267 --> 16:56.133
How do you think Tina
will react to this?

16:59.467 --> 17:00.500
>Look, you know what?

17:00.533 --> 17:02.833
All I know is that

17:02.867 --> 17:06.067
when I saw Angelica
about to go out the door today

17:06.100 --> 17:10.933
with Tina and Henry
and little fair-haired Mikey,

17:10.967 --> 17:13.500
I just...

17:13.533 --> 17:15.600
I just wanted to fucking scream,
you know?

17:15.633 --> 17:18.633
Because I do not
want my daughter

17:18.667 --> 17:21.667
growing up in a house
where she feels like an outsider

17:21.700 --> 17:23.367
because everyone else is white

17:23.400 --> 17:24.933
and when
she looks around

17:24.967 --> 17:26.567
she doesn't see
another familiar face

17:26.600 --> 17:28.400
that looks like
her own.

17:28.433 --> 17:30.233
You know, she's going
to get that enough as it is

17:30.267 --> 17:31.833
in the world at large,

17:31.867 --> 17:34.433
and I know--
I know what that feels like.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.700
Angelica...

17:37.733 --> 17:41.567
belongs with me.

17:43.667 --> 17:46.067
>And what did the guy say
when you told him

17:46.100 --> 17:49.167
that they passed on Moira
for a lesser job

17:49.200 --> 17:52.367
with the exact same resume
and the same qualifications?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.467
>Do you know how much

17:53.500 --> 17:54.667
they're offering to pay me,
Jenny?

17:54.700 --> 17:55.900
>What did he say?

17:55.933 --> 17:59.233
>Six figures.

17:59.267 --> 18:03.333
I mean, that means
we can get our own place,

18:03.367 --> 18:06.233
and between the book and this,

18:06.267 --> 18:10.333
it's like
we're practically rolling in it.

18:10.367 --> 18:12.133
>Yeah, but
you have to go back.

18:12.167 --> 18:13.233
You've got to go...

18:13.267 --> 18:14.267
>Come on.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.267
>You've got
to go back.

18:16.300 --> 18:17.700
You've got to
go confront

hypocrisy,

18:21.700 --> 18:23.200
You know, I spoke
to my agent about it,

18:23.233 --> 18:24.467
and she was going to
talk to the New Yorker

18:24.500 --> 18:25.600
about writing a piece.

18:25.633 --> 18:28.133
>That's so uncool.

18:28.167 --> 18:30.600
I mean, I told you,
I don't want to do that.

18:30.633 --> 18:33.367
>So, what are you
going to do now?

18:33.400 --> 18:35.200
Are you going to sell out?

18:35.233 --> 18:36.767

[KIT]: >Dana, we are not all
athletes like you!

36:27.267 --> 36:30.067
>[MAX]:
Come on, Kit.

36:30.067 --> 36:32.267
You can make it.

36:32.300 --> 36:33.867
>[breathing heavily]

36:35.967 --> 36:37.367
>Hey, you guys!

36:37.400 --> 36:39.967
Look at
the waterfall.

36:49.067 --> 36:52.067
>Dana...

36:52.067 --> 36:57.067
you don't know how much
we're going to miss you.

36:57.067 --> 36:59.667
>But we know that
everything is fine...

36:59.700 --> 37:02.567
and you're in
a peaceful place,

37:02.600 --> 37:04.433
and everything
is okay.

37:04.467 --> 37:05.567
>No, it's not.

37:08.633 --> 37:09.667
>Of course it's not.

37:09.700 --> 37:11.067
It's not for us,

37:11.067 --> 37:13.633
but Dana
is in a peaceful place.

37:13.667 --> 37:14.967
She is.

37:15.067 --> 37:16.667
>No. No,
I don't buy

37:16.700 --> 37:19.400
that fucking
spiritual bullshit,

37:19.433 --> 37:20.633
and I can't sit here

37:20.667 --> 37:21.733
and pretend
that it's okay,

37:21.767 --> 37:24.767
because it's not!

37:24.800 --> 37:29.233
And she didn't
die peacefully.

37:29.267 --> 37:32.633
She died alone,

37:32.667 --> 37:34.467
and I'm not going
to sit here

37:34.500 --> 37:36.400
and put this in a box
with a ribbon

37:36.433 --> 37:39.100
just to make everyone
feel better,

37:39.133 --> 37:42.067
because it's not
the truth.

37:42.100 --> 37:43.167
It's not.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.933
>Shane?

37:49.967 --> 37:51.067
Shane!
