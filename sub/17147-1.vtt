Kid, I've been all over

I've seen it and ate it all.

Hey! Nothing wrong with being spineless.

They secretly invaded Earth,
then gathered up all the Captain Cakerz

06:29.473 --> 06:31.433

After that,
the Gloopies proceeded to enslave humanity

Tell him our theory,

Not that theory, Dr. Tyson.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.425
Oh, right. Sorry.

07:05.509 --> 07:09.304
The Gloopies are pretty much
just big glops of sour milk.

07:13.392 --> 07:14.726
Captain Cakerz,
of course!

07:14.810 --> 07:17.980
Indeed. We believe
that if they come in contact with it,

07:18.063 --> 07:19.523
they'll dry out and die.

07:19.606 --> 07:24.027
Yeah! I even designed these
