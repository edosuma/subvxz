Piggy, I don't think
Kermie Jr. is doing so well.

00:40.875 --> 00:44.643
Kill me!
I'm in constant pain!

00:44.645 --> 00:45.978
(knocking)

00:46.913 --> 00:48.012
Oh, hey, Quagmire.

00:48.014 --> 00:50.916
Hey, Peter, do you mind
if I hang out here a while?

00:50.918 --> 00:52.051
I accidentally made
eye contact

00:52.053 --> 00:54.887
with a transvestite at a bar,
and he followed me home.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.655
You knew what you
were staring at!

00:56.657 --> 00:59.024
Get out of here, you mess!
You were far away!

00:59.026 --> 01:00.092
I didn't know
what you were!

01:00.094 --> 01:02.327
You know you want me!
Shut up!
Now go home!

01:02.329 --> 01:03.529
Nobody saw me come here!

01:03.531 --> 01:04.530
I said, shut up!

01:04.532 --> 01:05.764
(whispers):
Sneak around back.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.166
Oh, sure.
Come on in, Quagmire.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.901
Oh, you don't have
to take your shoes off.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.235
Our house sucks.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.438
So, Quagmire, if you're
some kind of big ladies' man,

01:12.440 --> 01:14.540
how come I never see you
wearing a necklace?

01:14.542 --> 01:16.508
I, uh... that's
not really my thing.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.843
I'll get you one.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.411
Please don't.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.579
(a la Vinny):
Hey, come on!

01:20.581 --> 01:22.081
The guy wants
to get you a necklace,

01:22.083 --> 01:23.449

01:41.534 --> 01:43.602
Wow, we sound
amazing together!

01:43.604 --> 01:45.037
I know!
That was incredible!

01:45.039 --> 01:47.039
You know, we should do
something with this.

01:47.041 --> 01:49.074
Yeah, maybe we could open up
a mattress store.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.476
Or we could try singing.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.477
Yeah, singing,
that's good!

01:51.479 --> 01:53.212
Wow, finally,
something in my life

01:53.214 --> 01:54.446
that makes me feel special.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.815
I mean, except for when
I had those cow udders.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.717
So, as you can see,
the fiscal projections

01:58.719 --> 02:01.153
for the fourth quarter make
this thing a slam dunk.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.788
Any questions?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.556
Not about my cow udders.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.792

years salary, tax free,

Anyway, you guys got
the talent,

05:22.022 --> 05:23.455

is a manager.

who can take a lion's share

05:26.927 --> 05:28.293

05:28.295 --> 05:30.095

So, what do you say?

05:30.097 --> 05:31.630

09:19.559 --> 09:21.259
What you doing
with that doll?

09:21.261 --> 09:22.594
Oh, hello, Vinny.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.163
Rupert and I are just having
a spritzer and some cheese

09:25.165 --> 09:26.364
in advance
of the performance.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.166
I wouldn't do that.
Why not?

09:28.168 --> 09:29.401
You know,
there was a guy

09:29.403 --> 09:31.002
on my old block,
Johnny Chickstuff.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.238
We called him that because
he used to like to, uh...

09:33.240 --> 09:34.339
Do chick stuff?

09:34.341 --> 09:35.707
Do chick stuff!
Exactly.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.242
Anyway, a bunch of us
got together

09:37.244 --> 09:40.612
and beat him with a grill lid
and windshield wipers,

09:40.614 --> 09:43.348
and let's just say, uh, he
don't do chick stuff no more.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.716
'Cause of the beatin's?

09:44.718 --> 09:46.618
Yeah. He wasn't
exactly like us,

09:46.620 --> 09:48.386
so we had to
almost kill him.

09:48.388 --> 09:50.455
That sounds terrible.
What happened to him?

09:50.457 --> 09:51.923
I don't know.
Soon thereafter,

09:51.925 --> 09:54.225
a girl in the neighborhood
married a black guy,

09:54.227 --> 09:56.861
so we all kind of turned
our attention to that.

09:56.863 --> 09:59.130
(guitars tuning)

09:59.132 --> 10:00.298
Look at us, Quagmire.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.100
We're making music,
living the dream.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.035
And to think,
just last week,

10:04.037 --> 10:06.938
my only creative outlet was
picking hockey fights at work.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.274
Griffin, I need
these shipping reports

10:09.276 --> 10:11.142
filled out by 5:00 today.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.384
Hey, Peter, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.919
Oh, that's great.
Thank you so much.

10:20.921 --> 10:21.920
What's your name, honey?

10:21.922 --> 10:23.154
It's me, Lois.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.089
All right,
backstage whore,

10:24.091 --> 10:25.657
here's the key
to my hotel room.

10:25.659 --> 10:28.093
You can flush the dump
I left in there.
What?!

10:28.095 --> 10:29.494

11:41.901 --> 11:43.201
Hey, you guys were great.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.736
Aw, thanks.
My name's Ricky.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.237
I'm with Sony Records.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.306
Our company's gonna be around
for at least three more weeks,

11:48.308 --> 11:50.208
and we want to sign you.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.844
I'll need to discuss this
with my associate.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.346
I don't know, it-it seems
wrong to just dump Mort.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.915
He's our friend.
Doesn't that matter?

11:56.917 --> 11:59.350
Quagmire, you remember I told
you about that dream I drew?

11:59.352 --> 12:01.219
Yeah?
We're halfway there.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.521
I think if we do this,
we'll get the giraffe.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.156
Okay, okay, I'm in.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.224
You got a deal.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.892
Great!
I'm gonna get you on tour.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.762
This is the beginning
of something big.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.197
Great news, guys!

12:12.199 --> 12:14.766
I may have gotten you booked
at a horse's birthday party.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.267
Mort, you're fired.
What?

12:16.269 --> 12:18.269
Sorry, Mort, but this is
a cutthroat business.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.271
And we need someone tough
in our corner.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.341
Like Indonesian kickboxer
Agoos Bahnwati.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.510
Come on. Come on.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.345
Come on,
come on.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.047
Disappear, disappear.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.349
Come on. Come on.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.455
Peter, I heard you fired Mort.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.890
He's your friend.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.126
He's the one that got you
to where you are today.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.795
Lois, my transcendent talent
got me to where I am.

12:43.797 --> 12:46.297
Peter, I don't like what
success is doing to you.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.533
Yeah, well, I don't like
what time is doing to you.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.802
Droop, droop...
(imitates explosion)

12:50.804 --> 12:52.403
Hey, Chris, you ready
with my luggage?

12:52.405 --> 12:53.772
Luggage? For what?

12:53.774 --> 12:55.373
We're going on tour, Lois.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.641
Here you go, Dad.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.977
I emptied this out so
it'd be easier to carry.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.478
Oh, you're right, it is easier.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.579
Good thinking, son.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.381
All right, see you guys
in two months.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.083
Peter, you can't go away
for two months now.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.718
You'll miss Thanksgiving.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.286
I'm sorry, but you're
gonna have to choose

13:08.288 --> 13:10.155
between music and family.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.422
If I choose family,

13:11.424 --> 13:12.891
does it have to
be this family?

13:12.893 --> 13:14.559
Yes, Peter, this family.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.660
So make your choice.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.629
Very well,
this scavenger hunt

13:17.631 --> 13:20.231
will provide you
with my answer.

13:22.668 --> 13:25.103
Here it is--
a penny from 1858!

13:25.105 --> 13:27.238
We're getting closer
to our answer.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.408
Wake up, Mom!
He chose the music!

13:36.015 --> 13:37.415
(sighs)
You know, Quagmire,

13:37.417 --> 13:39.150
I feel kind of bad
leaving the family like this

13:39.152 --> 13:40.919
with Thanksgiving coming up.

13:40.921 --> 13:44.155
I mean, if I'm not there,

18:49.162 --> 18:50.495
Wh-What was that about?

18:50.497 --> 18:52.430
This is my time.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.232
Don't ever (bleep)
talk to me

18:54.234 --> 18:56.534
during my time!

18:59.771 --> 19:02.773
Well, kids,
happy Thanksgiving.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.609
I wish Dad was here.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.310
Meg, could you zip up your fly?

19:06.312 --> 19:08.146
Th-That's kind of
wafting over here.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.914
(guitar strumming nearby)

19:09.916 --> 19:11.516
PETER:

Peter?
Dad?

19:14.187 --> 19:15.286
Oh, boy.

19:15.288 --> 19:16.687
Larry, you got
to get out of here.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.122
It's been a great
two months!

19:18.124 --> 19:20.057

19:27.267 --> 19:31.802

19:31.804 --> 19:33.538
Peter, what are you doing here?

19:33.540 --> 19:35.840
Me and Quagmire kind
of had a falling out.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.608
And after that,
I-I realized I...

19:37.610 --> 19:38.776
Meg, can you please stop

19:38.778 --> 19:40.545
stuffing your face
for two seconds?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.381
Look, I'm sorry
for being a jerk,

19:43.383 --> 19:45.383
and letting a little fame
go to my head.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.785
I just hope you guys
can forgive me.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.454
Oh, Peter.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.223
(moans)

19:52.225 --> 19:53.991
I missed you so much.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.960
Oh, we missed you, too.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.461
But I understand.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.829
You had to go
chase your dream.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.731
And a part of me
is glad you did.

20:00.733 --> 20:04.168
But now I'm just happy
that you're home.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.403
Welcome home, Dad!

20:05.405 --> 20:07.972
So, did you get a lot of
trim on the road, Dad?

20:07.974 --> 20:10.074
Chris, that's inappropriate.

20:14.479 --> 20:17.081
QUAGMIRE:
Hey, you got room for another?

20:18.750 --> 20:19.884
Quagmire?

20:19.886 --> 20:21.686
I thought you were
still out on the road.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.588
I was, but then I thought,

20:23.590 --> 20:25.423
what was Simon
without Garfunkel?

20:25.425 --> 20:27.225
Wildly successful?

20:27.227 --> 20:29.160
Yeah, but all that success
would mean nothing

20:29.162 --> 20:30.695
if I lost my best friend.

20:30.697 --> 20:33.064
Do you... do you think
you can forgive me?

20:33.066 --> 20:35.166
Oh, Quagmire.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.839
Well, I'm glad to have you back
home for Thanksgiving, Peter.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.608
And I'm glad to be here.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.776
'Cause everyone knows
that life after being famous

20:45.778 --> 20:48.412
is even better
than it was before.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.514
Let me just grab my
