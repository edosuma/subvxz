00:16.300 --> 00:18.733
Constance.

00:24.804 --> 00:27.118
I thought we were spending the morning.

00:27.119 --> 00:28.051
What?

00:28.052 --> 00:30.418
Together?

00:35.409 --> 00:38.466
You do know this is not
what I had in mind.

00:38.467 --> 00:41.299
I know what you had in mind.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.541
The garrison needs to eat.

00:43.542 --> 00:46.938
Why exactly do we need a cadet
guard to bring in provisions?

00:48.383 --> 00:51.089
You've been away from
Paris for a long time.

01:05.301 --> 01:06.819
Do you need to hit so hard?

01:06.820 --> 01:09.476
How hard do you think they're
hitting out there?

01:33.954 --> 01:35.294
Stand aside!

01:37.254 --> 01:39.453
It's the Duke of Beaufort.

01:39.454 --> 01:42.354
His lands feed most of Paris.

01:56.220 --> 01:59.087
Let me through!

02:14.433 --> 02:16.132
The harvest you sweated and

02:16.133 --> 02:18.748
suffered for all summer, it's gone.

02:30.404 --> 02:32.241
What does the granary keeper say?

02:32.242 --> 02:34.008
The granary keeper is dead.

02:34.009 --> 02:36.108
Who would do such a thing?

02:36.109 --> 02:38.809
The refugees!

02:53.386 --> 02:55.118
Cadets to attention!

02:55.119 --> 02:56.129
Stand guard.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.949
Clairmont, get Athos and the others now!

03:07.950 --> 03:10.417
Now, Clairmont!

03:14.072 --> 03:15.405
Move the children and old

03:15.406 --> 03:18.471
people away from here,
and arm yourselves!

03:18.472 --> 03:19.680
Against such odds?

03:19.681 --> 03:22.201
I thought I'd taught you
better than that, Sylvie.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.635
If the cause is just.

03:25.104 --> 03:27.295
Hold them here for as long as you can.

03:28.553 --> 03:31.219
You men, up here, come!

03:31.737 --> 03:32.968
Clementine!

03:32.969 --> 03:34.367
Quickly!

03:34.368 --> 03:35.934
Hide the children, go!

03:35.935 --> 03:37.934
Arm yourself, Pierre!

03:37.935 --> 03:39.300
Go!

03:39.301 --> 03:41.401
Defend yourselves!

03:46.301 --> 03:48.767
Léon, what are you doing?

03:48.768 --> 03:50.109
You saw that mob!

03:50.110 --> 03:52.332
I'm not staying here to get slaughtered.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.367
You'd desert us now?

03:57.368 --> 03:59.334
Help Clementine.

03:59.335 --> 04:01.134
Help her.

04:01.135 --> 04:04.068
Come this way.

04:09.976 --> 04:11.609
Cadets, fall back!

04:11.610 --> 04:14.142
Fall back!

04:15.706 --> 04:18.206
Form a line.

04:20.014 --> 04:21.755
Our grain is there!

04:32.317 --> 04:35.083
Two war heroes at once.

04:35.084 --> 04:37.551
I deserve a medal.

04:48.884 --> 04:52.550
Captain!

04:52.551 --> 04:53.934
Captain!

04:55.917 --> 04:57.883
What do you want?

04:57.884 --> 04:59.916
Captain, it's D'Artagnan.

04:59.917 --> 05:03.017
There's a riot in Saint Antoine.

05:06.429 --> 05:09.689
- Synced and corrected by hawken45 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:48.950 --> 05:50.950
Ah, to success, my lord.

05:53.079 --> 05:55.672
Why did he murder my grain keeper?

05:55.673 --> 05:58.538
We have made your grain disappear.

05:58.539 --> 06:01.672
It is too late for us
to put it back now.

06:01.673 --> 06:02.824
Will you have a drink?

06:02.825 --> 06:04.822
I won't drink with that creature.

06:07.736 --> 06:09.464
If the King will pay
the price we demand...

06:09.465 --> 06:11.766
Price you demand, in fact.

06:11.917 --> 06:13.383
We should settle with him now

06:13.384 --> 06:14.837
and end this squalid enterprise.

06:14.838 --> 06:16.304
We wait.

06:17.487 --> 06:19.286
The price is bound to go up.

06:19.287 --> 06:21.300
The people of Paris have no bread.

06:22.222 --> 06:24.355
Desperation is always lucrative.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.398
Hold out for one week.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.883
The King will double your money,

06:28.884 --> 06:30.995
and you'll settle your debts for good.

06:32.042 --> 06:33.241
Drink.

06:33.750 --> 06:36.449
I only drink with gentlemen.

06:36.450 --> 06:38.844
He is trying to help you, My Lord.

06:39.325 --> 06:42.983
Remember those niggling
financial worries?

06:42.984 --> 06:47.029
One week and they vanish. Forever.

06:47.030 --> 06:48.796
Trust, Grimaud, hm?

06:48.797 --> 06:50.596
He may not be a gentleman, but

06:50.597 --> 06:52.612
he has a talent for making money.

06:56.830 --> 06:59.429
One week, no more.

06:59.430 --> 07:02.029
Let's hope the King proves to

07:02.030 --> 07:06.297
be as amenable as you, My Lord.

07:13.897 --> 07:17.629
Disperse immediately!

07:17.630 --> 07:20.164
Stand back!

07:26.348 --> 07:29.025
These are the names of the ring leaders.

07:30.215 --> 07:32.414
You know their faces.

07:32.415 --> 07:34.280
Arrest them.

07:34.281 --> 07:36.242
You can't do that.

07:36.461 --> 07:37.960
You again?

07:38.248 --> 07:41.147
You're becoming a nuisance.

07:41.148 --> 07:43.180
Don't touch her.

07:43.181 --> 07:45.726
So this is the husband.

07:47.792 --> 07:50.925
You have married a world of
trouble there, Musketeer.

07:50.926 --> 07:52.440
You should keep her on a leash.

07:52.441 --> 07:54.873
- A leash?
- Mm.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.540
Arrest him for affray.

07:56.541 --> 07:57.606
Just leave...

07:57.607 --> 07:58.851
D'Artagnan!

07:58.883 --> 07:59.949
Leave her!

07:59.950 --> 08:00.849
Leave her!

08:00.850 --> 08:02.715
I'll go quietly.

08:03.625 --> 08:05.149
Proper wildcat, aren't you?

08:06.222 --> 08:07.715
Let's not waste any time.

08:08.551 --> 08:10.382
Break down the gates!

08:49.057 --> 08:50.490
Hubert!

08:50.721 --> 08:52.920
Leave him alone!

08:52.946 --> 08:54.411
Get up, Hubert!

08:54.437 --> 08:56.103
I'll hold you up.

08:56.129 --> 08:58.361
You go on.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.160
If they see those,
you'll condemn us all.

09:02.161 --> 09:03.481
Burn them!

09:07.402 --> 09:09.489
Tell Treville what happened here.

09:17.959 --> 09:19.369
Marcheaux!

09:21.859 --> 09:23.524
Marcheaux!

09:24.088 --> 09:27.091
You don't have the authority
to make these arrests.

09:27.092 --> 09:29.258
On the contrary Madame.

09:29.259 --> 09:32.525
They have my authority.

09:34.892 --> 09:36.458
What's going on here?

09:36.459 --> 09:37.991
Where's D'Artagnan?

09:37.992 --> 09:39.997
Ah, the rescue party.

09:40.023 --> 09:40.999
You're late.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.165
The riot is over.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.799
The troublemakers have been apprehended.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.465
They've arrested D'Artagnan
with the others.

09:48.709 --> 09:51.069
Get involved with filth like this,

09:52.212 --> 09:54.965
and you will all face the consequences.

09:54.966 --> 09:57.932
What are they meant to have done?

09:58.603 --> 10:02.213
Is stealing the Duke of Beaufort's
grain not enough for you?

10:02.214 --> 10:05.746
Thanks to them, the people
of Paris will go hungry.

10:05.747 --> 10:09.146
How can you hide a thousand
sacks of grain in here?

10:09.147 --> 10:11.779
Well, why don't we take a look?

10:12.381 --> 10:15.447
I'm sure we'll get a
confession before they are

10:15.448 --> 10:17.964
hanged in the morning. We always do.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.005
This is Paris.

10:19.006 --> 10:21.158
They're entitled to a fair trial.

10:22.265 --> 10:26.294
Being in Paris, does not
make one a Parisian.

10:26.834 --> 10:30.131
Or would you grant that
status to the sewer rats?

10:32.498 --> 10:35.796
Some rats have high enough status.

10:35.797 --> 10:36.830
I'm ruined.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.664
Our family has faithfully served

10:38.665 --> 10:39.997
Your Majesty and his forefathers

10:39.998 --> 10:42.193
for generations only
for it end like this.

10:42.194 --> 10:44.011
Calm down, Beaufort.

10:44.012 --> 10:45.314
I'm sure we can do something to help.

10:45.315 --> 10:47.880
The entire harvest is gone.

10:49.031 --> 10:52.164
There are food shortages
in Paris already.

10:52.165 --> 10:54.299
How could this have happened?

10:54.300 --> 10:55.573
Where were the Red Guard?

10:55.574 --> 10:57.473
Breaking up the ensuing riot.

10:58.066 --> 11:03.732
It seems, Majesty, the rabble that set
up camp in Saint Antoine is responsible.

11:03.733 --> 11:07.232
French citizens displaced by the war.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.008
They came to Paris for sanctuary.

11:09.009 --> 11:10.626
The obvious solution

11:11.692 --> 11:15.034
is to import a new
consignment, Your Majesty,

11:15.035 --> 11:18.081
but that's likely to prove expensive.

11:18.082 --> 11:21.414
Why does everything come
down to more money?

11:21.415 --> 11:23.147
Isn't the war costing enough?

11:23.148 --> 11:29.079
We wouldn't want to risk any
further unrest amongst the people.

11:29.082 --> 11:31.247
What do you say, Treville?

11:31.248 --> 11:33.956
The people expect their
quarterly supply.

11:33.957 --> 11:37.023
It has always been a gesture
of the king's good grace...

11:37.024 --> 11:40.356
But, of course, the king can
not let his people suffer.

11:40.357 --> 11:41.956
Treville is quite right.

11:41.957 --> 11:44.295
I, myself, know someone, a financier

11:44.382 --> 11:45.873
who has contacts in the low countries

11:45.874 --> 11:48.160
and in England, Your Majesty.

11:48.161 --> 11:50.526
He may be able to help us.

11:51.442 --> 11:52.775
Very well.

11:52.776 --> 11:54.873
I will meet the costs, this once.

12:48.681 --> 12:52.084
Are you without secrets, Captain?

12:52.085 --> 12:54.051
This is more than secrets.

12:54.052 --> 12:56.647
Calling for the king's
head is open sedition.

12:56.648 --> 13:00.965
That has nothing to do with
Beaufort's accusations against us.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.247
Are you going to arrest me?

13:06.097 --> 13:08.017
Who taught you how to handle that?

13:08.018 --> 13:09.484
I taught myself.

13:09.485 --> 13:12.259
Then you are not a bad student,

13:12.728 --> 13:14.761
merely a poor tutor.

13:15.614 --> 13:20.180
At this range, the bullet will
pass clean through me.

13:22.588 --> 13:26.158
There is every chance I will have
strength enough to retaliate.

13:48.588 --> 13:50.834
Those were my father's words,

13:50.835 --> 13:52.366
his life's work.

13:52.367 --> 13:54.566
I couldn't destroy it.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.673
This is treason.

13:58.541 --> 14:02.164
15 years ago, this was the symbol
for the Army of Suffering.

14:02.165 --> 14:03.097
Rebels.

14:03.305 --> 14:04.565
Ordinary men and women with

14:04.566 --> 14:06.858
many of the grievances you hear today:

14:06.884 --> 14:08.065
no food, shelter.

14:08.797 --> 14:12.263
Their only crime was to petition
King Henry for fairness.

14:12.264 --> 14:14.896
Their cause was just.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.296
Henry ignored their pleas.

14:17.297 --> 14:18.663
Their anger grew with their

14:18.664 --> 14:20.030
suffering, and this symbol of

14:20.031 --> 14:21.763
protest appeared everywhere.

14:21.764 --> 14:25.597
Then he answered, emphatically.

14:27.964 --> 14:30.263
Destroy this and any others.

14:30.920 --> 14:34.186
Feron will try to influence
Magistrate Bellavoix.

14:34.212 --> 14:36.435
Look to use anything
against his prisoners.

14:36.436 --> 14:38.313
D'Artagnan is still one of them.

14:38.314 --> 14:40.611
He will be released in the morning.

14:40.612 --> 14:43.534
The refugees may or may
not be guilty, Athos,

14:43.811 --> 14:47.103
but I won't have them
slaughtered on Beaufort's whim.

14:47.104 --> 14:51.337
People must see there is still
some justice left in this world.

15:04.937 --> 15:07.341
Tell me, Musketeer,

15:07.367 --> 15:10.503
why did you defend us?

15:10.504 --> 15:12.903
We mean nothing to you.

15:14.001 --> 15:16.320
What the Red Guard
were doing was unjust.

15:16.321 --> 15:18.214
I couldn't just stand by
and watch that happen.

15:18.215 --> 15:21.181
You couldn't stand by?

15:23.581 --> 15:27.814
Please, sit with me.

15:27.815 --> 15:30.247
Come.

15:30.248 --> 15:32.083
No, no, no, no.

15:32.084 --> 15:34.516
Come, come.

15:40.451 --> 15:43.983
You can not blame them

15:43.984 --> 15:46.316
for mistrusting your uniform.

15:46.317 --> 15:52.416
Everyone here had a home, trade, family.

15:54.309 --> 15:57.134
All that was taken away by your kind.

15:57.135 --> 15:58.967
- My kind?
- Yes

15:59.768 --> 16:03.232
My kind fights the war to
maintain your freedom.

16:04.893 --> 16:07.625
And you think a Spanish king

16:08.361 --> 16:10.340
will be worse than this French one?

16:10.341 --> 16:11.278
That's treason.

16:11.279 --> 16:12.944
Perhaps.

16:13.699 --> 16:15.865
I'm an old man.

16:18.442 --> 16:19.744
You preach rebellion?

16:20.802 --> 16:22.577
Is it rebellion

16:23.005 --> 16:26.584
to fight against unfairness
whenever you see it,

16:28.442 --> 16:31.286
or to stand up against an unjust enemy?

16:33.284 --> 16:38.189
Perhaps we are not so
very different after all.

16:43.650 --> 16:45.683
Sit back, sit back, sit back,

16:45.684 --> 16:47.283
sit back.

16:47.284 --> 16:48.549
Sit back.

16:56.107 --> 16:58.772
There is a better world

17:00.735 --> 17:04.010
coming, while we might
not live to see it.

17:04.011 --> 17:05.992
You will have a fair trial, Hubert.

17:08.268 --> 17:09.934
I will see to that.

17:11.357 --> 17:13.727
Minister Treville will help.

17:15.465 --> 17:16.565
Hang them!

17:16.590 --> 17:18.041
The sooner, the better.

17:18.068 --> 17:20.214
We must cleanse the
streets of these vermin.

17:20.214 --> 17:21.748
What more do you want, eh?

17:21.749 --> 17:24.681
Already there has been
rioting, Magistrate Bellavoix.

17:24.944 --> 17:28.810
For the sake of maintaining order
in Paris, an example must be made.

17:28.811 --> 17:30.546
This is a mockery of justice.

17:30.547 --> 17:31.812
Where is your proof?

17:31.813 --> 17:34.547
Minister Treville's point
will stand, Governor Feron.

17:34.588 --> 17:38.306
The evidence against these people
seems unsatisfactory at best.

17:38.307 --> 17:41.504
But what about the unsatisfactory
damage to my family's good name?

17:41.508 --> 17:45.040
I'm quite sure that the House of
Beaufort has strength enough to recover.

17:46.078 --> 17:48.977
Governor Feron?

17:50.374 --> 17:54.060
I can provide substantial evidence

17:54.061 --> 17:55.995
at Your Honour's convenience.

17:56.073 --> 17:58.696
You have proof that one
thousand sacks of grain

17:58.697 --> 18:01.130
have been secreted
around the settlement?

18:01.131 --> 18:02.497
It's not possible.

18:03.017 --> 18:06.849
These refugees are
resourceful, Treville.

18:07.299 --> 18:10.208
Pending the production of
the Governor's evidence,

18:10.209 --> 18:12.943
executions will be set at noon tomorrow.

18:22.942 --> 18:25.399
You can find evidence, I presume?

18:40.376 --> 18:41.241
Gaoler.

18:41.242 --> 18:43.185
The old man needs a physician, now.

18:43.186 --> 18:44.606
There's no point patching him up.

18:44.607 --> 18:47.339
He'll be executed with the
rest of them in the morning.

18:47.340 --> 18:48.373
Hey!

18:48.374 --> 18:50.106
Captain.

18:51.601 --> 18:53.091
What's this?

18:53.092 --> 18:54.757
We have to make it look real.

18:55.210 --> 18:57.934
Governor Feron has a
special task for you.

18:57.935 --> 18:59.400
Be convincing.

19:00.668 --> 19:01.770
Interrogation.

19:01.771 --> 19:03.137
Orders of the Governor.

19:03.139 --> 19:06.704
If you're lucky, perhaps you'll be next.

19:12.839 --> 19:14.104
Léon.

19:14.542 --> 19:15.675
Don't break him.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.037
He'll condemn us all.

19:17.038 --> 19:18.237
Try to stay calm.

19:18.263 --> 19:19.536
Look at me.

19:19.562 --> 19:20.628
Try to stay calm.

19:20.629 --> 19:21.361
We'll fight this.

19:21.362 --> 19:22.492
We'll fight this.

19:24.726 --> 19:26.292
How?

19:26.293 --> 19:28.793
You have more of these?

19:31.778 --> 19:34.710
This could condemn all of the
prisoners, D'Artagnan too.

19:34.736 --> 19:37.568
Some would consider the ideas dangerous.

19:37.867 --> 19:40.812
My father would say they're only
dangerous because they still matter.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.179
Oh, they're his ideas?

19:42.482 --> 19:44.048
Well, he incited people?

19:44.425 --> 19:45.339
Inspired them.

19:45.340 --> 19:46.206
To revolt.

19:46.207 --> 19:49.872
To fight for change for a better life!

19:51.326 --> 19:52.655
Take a look around you.

19:52.656 --> 19:54.578
Would you really leave Paris as it is?

19:54.579 --> 19:55.625
Madame D'Artagnan!

19:55.626 --> 19:57.625
Madame D'Artagnan!

19:57.626 --> 19:59.625
We used to knock.

19:59.626 --> 20:01.491
Sorry, Captain.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.058
Clairmont?

20:03.059 --> 20:04.258
Found something.

20:04.855 --> 20:09.554
One cup per person, three
livres, take it or leave it.

20:09.555 --> 20:12.287
We checked all the local
markets, found nothing.

20:12.288 --> 20:14.961
On the way back, we came across him.

20:14.962 --> 20:15.794
Good work.

20:15.795 --> 20:18.494
You wretched bunch of
rodents, money first!

20:18.495 --> 20:21.027
We should have a little
talk with the trader.

20:21.028 --> 20:24.759
He could benefit from our special
brand of our tact and diplomacy.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.346
It's been a while.

20:32.395 --> 20:35.327
Move!

20:38.788 --> 20:40.352
Oh, I'm ever so sorry about this.

20:40.353 --> 20:41.751
It's just that my friend here

20:41.752 --> 20:43.218
is certain that this is one of the

20:43.219 --> 20:45.784
sacks stolen from the Duke de
Beaufort's store, you see.

20:45.785 --> 20:47.584
It has the king's mark.

20:47.585 --> 20:50.851
Oh, yes, so it does.

20:51.672 --> 20:53.901
You're looking at a charge of treason.

20:53.902 --> 20:55.501
I never saw the man before.

20:55.502 --> 20:57.134
He was selling off the wagon

20:57.135 --> 20:58.495
behind the market square.

20:58.496 --> 20:59.795
He's lying!

21:01.029 --> 21:02.162
Oh, my!

21:02.163 --> 21:04.065
Aramis, no.

21:04.971 --> 21:06.373
No more breaking legs.

21:06.374 --> 21:07.820
I never knew it was crooked!

21:09.423 --> 21:10.771
Maybe just an arm, huh?

21:10.772 --> 21:12.537
Last chance.

21:13.475 --> 21:17.259
The wagon, it was branded
with the sign of a star.

21:17.260 --> 21:21.352
That's all I know. I swear.

21:23.223 --> 21:25.603
This is who he got the grain from.

21:28.853 --> 21:32.019
Most of my wagons are
being used by the army.

21:32.778 --> 21:35.036
You'll not find a spare in Paris.

21:35.037 --> 21:37.470
There's a war on.

21:40.448 --> 21:43.775
Why do I get the feeling our friend
knows more than he's saying?

21:43.776 --> 21:44.640
Mm.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.409
What's that?

21:53.410 --> 21:55.910
Limestone dust.

21:58.185 --> 22:01.417
We've got a shipment of grain
coming in from the south.

22:01.443 --> 22:02.809
It's a big shipment.

22:03.507 --> 22:06.593
You must've heard the store in
Saint Antoine was robbed.

22:06.774 --> 22:08.673
I can't help you.

22:08.674 --> 22:10.407
All my wagons are out.

22:10.408 --> 22:12.293
Even that one's promised.

22:12.319 --> 22:13.642
Oh.

22:16.976 --> 22:19.531
A fine-looking animal. Andalusian?

22:23.192 --> 22:24.143
Ha!

22:37.839 --> 22:41.144
There's only one limestone
quarry this side of Paris.

22:41.145 --> 22:44.277
I'm on it.

22:52.544 --> 22:55.311
They've taken Léon away.

22:58.462 --> 23:02.192
Then they have what they want...

23:03.964 --> 23:07.096
A confession.

23:08.141 --> 23:09.397
We must hang.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.279
Listen to me.

23:14.623 --> 23:17.368
I have friends on the
outside that can help you.

23:18.643 --> 23:20.111
Hubert?

23:25.610 --> 23:28.076
Hubert?

23:39.610 --> 23:41.810
Hubert?

23:56.308 --> 23:57.673
Do it quickly.

23:57.699 --> 24:00.965
Make sure the grain sacks can be found.

24:00.966 --> 24:03.946
If you have to, take care of the watch.

24:12.899 --> 24:15.533
Who's there?

24:18.799 --> 24:21.066
Who's there?

24:24.290 --> 24:25.555
Léon!

24:27.199 --> 24:30.233
Thank heaven you're safe.

24:32.853 --> 24:33.867
You're hurt.

24:35.492 --> 24:36.954
What are you doing?

24:56.478 --> 24:59.611
Oh, the conceit of the man.

25:01.989 --> 25:10.349
Beaufort must lie awake at night
worrying about his own snivelling greed.

25:11.262 --> 25:14.971
Got his nose so high in the air he
should take care no one cuts it off.

25:14.972 --> 25:16.237
You be careful, Grimaud.

25:17.310 --> 25:19.343
I've been sneered at by better men.

25:20.441 --> 25:21.840
They're dead now.

25:22.822 --> 25:26.971
My dear fellow, I have always
admired your practical nature,

25:26.972 --> 25:34.436
but you must remember His Lordship
is a favourite of the king's.

25:34.439 --> 25:38.769
However much Beaufort despises
me, he'll keep coming back.

25:39.256 --> 25:41.793
He needs what only I can give him.

25:43.982 --> 25:45.191
You take too much.

25:49.198 --> 25:51.944
You don't know the pain I'm in.

25:52.105 --> 25:54.138
I know pain.

25:54.282 --> 25:56.814
Then join me.

25:56.863 --> 25:57.902
Hm?

25:59.872 --> 26:02.304
Control at all times, eh?

26:03.530 --> 26:07.321
Better to suffer than to lose judgment.

26:07.347 --> 26:09.253
Have you never wondered what
it might be like to let

26:09.846 --> 26:12.752
that invulnerable guard of yours down

26:14.013 --> 26:15.877
for just one moment,

26:18.333 --> 26:24.676
feel that sensation of pure euphoria

26:24.708 --> 26:27.870
crash like a wonderful wave,

26:31.016 --> 26:33.441
all that suffering just...

26:35.403 --> 26:36.665
washed away?

26:36.940 --> 26:38.939
Hm?

26:38.940 --> 26:42.105
Suffering is what makes us stronger.

26:44.271 --> 26:48.379
There's always been something of the
Old Testament about you, Grimaud.

26:54.863 --> 26:58.029
Your work is not yet done.

26:59.352 --> 27:01.462
It is in hand.

27:03.585 --> 27:06.537
And if it is to be completed
to the satisfaction of all

27:06.538 --> 27:11.039
concerned, I suggest you
let me take my medicine.

27:36.537 --> 27:38.669
D'Artagnan.

27:39.750 --> 27:42.485
Your letter to the Front
said nothing of this.

27:42.486 --> 27:45.792
Red Guards killing who they
please, cowards like Marcheaux

27:45.793 --> 27:46.904
deciding a man's fate.

27:46.905 --> 27:48.635
This is not what I fought for.

27:48.636 --> 27:50.469
And what did you fight for?

27:51.252 --> 27:52.985
We're freeing those people in there.

27:52.986 --> 27:54.249
Of course, we are.

27:54.336 --> 27:56.753
You think we've been out
here doing nothing?

27:57.502 --> 27:59.636
Huh?

28:09.518 --> 28:11.784
So this is what Paris has become?

28:11.785 --> 28:15.100
Innocent people condemned with no
evidence and no one to speak for them.

28:15.101 --> 28:17.267
That's the way Governor Feron likes it.

28:17.268 --> 28:19.300
And nobody argues with the king's blood.

28:19.301 --> 28:21.867
I wear the uniform of the
king's own regiment.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.614
Since when have the Red
Guard had the authority

28:23.640 --> 28:25.832
to arrest and imprison a Musketeer?

28:25.835 --> 28:27.400
His Majesty appointed Feron

28:27.401 --> 28:29.067
as Commander of the Red Guard.

28:29.844 --> 28:32.303
He's not only family
but a favourite too.

28:33.158 --> 28:36.123
And this Marcheaux,

28:37.100 --> 28:38.790
he's bothered you before?

28:40.020 --> 28:42.991
- Marcheaux doesn't scare me.
- That's not what I asked.

28:43.778 --> 28:45.177
Look, D'Artagnan,

28:45.654 --> 28:48.743
Treville brought you back to
fight a different kind of war.

28:48.998 --> 28:53.359
The danger facing Paris is the very man
who should be its protector. It's Feron.

28:59.184 --> 29:00.116
Why stay here?

29:00.327 --> 29:03.293
We will not be driven out by
the Red Guards or Musketeers.

29:03.294 --> 29:04.559
You trust anybody?

29:04.560 --> 29:07.581
Every betrayal we ever
suffered started with trust.

29:07.582 --> 29:09.355
You should get out while you still can.

29:09.356 --> 29:11.554
Since you're so keen to remove
anything incriminating,

29:11.555 --> 29:13.416
perhaps you should tear the
whole place down for us?

29:13.417 --> 29:16.516
Well, let's start with the
stolen medical supplies.

29:17.465 --> 29:18.537
Athos!

29:20.881 --> 29:22.676
These were not here yesterday.

29:25.020 --> 29:26.815
Someone wants you to hang.

29:26.816 --> 29:28.422
Everyone wants us to hang.

29:28.423 --> 29:29.821
Not everybody.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.824
What's happened?

29:45.347 --> 29:46.601
Oh, Clementine.

29:48.110 --> 29:50.808
Short blade under the ribs.

29:50.809 --> 29:52.832
This is the work of a soldier.

30:05.605 --> 30:06.891
Search the place!

30:09.587 --> 30:12.687
They mustn't find these.

30:18.804 --> 30:20.895
How did they find their
way through here?

30:36.668 --> 30:39.335
Hyah! Hyah!

30:43.817 --> 30:46.050
Ahh!

31:00.548 --> 31:04.313
We now have proof Feron has no proof
when he goes before the Magistrate.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.195
There is Léon.

31:07.972 --> 31:11.045
The Red Guard may have beaten
him into a false confession.

31:11.046 --> 31:13.955
Well, then we must find him before
they hang the refugees on it.

31:13.956 --> 31:14.922
Where's Porthos?

31:14.923 --> 31:16.622
Following a hunch.

31:16.860 --> 31:17.892
Following a hunch?

31:17.893 --> 31:18.730
It's a good one.

31:18.731 --> 31:19.597
No doubt.

31:20.033 --> 31:21.466
Leave word for him.

31:21.467 --> 31:24.467
Tell me, Hubert?

31:27.267 --> 31:29.967
He died during the night.

31:36.333 --> 31:37.965
Were you close?

31:38.300 --> 31:40.832
He's my father.

31:41.341 --> 31:42.619
I'm sorry.

31:48.496 --> 31:54.226
The people of Saint Antoine demand
swift justice, Monsieur Magistrate.

31:54.825 --> 31:58.076
I fear for the stability of the
district if it is not forthcoming.

31:58.077 --> 32:01.474
I will not proceed without
proof of the prisoners' guilt.

32:01.475 --> 32:04.941
Proof may yet present itself.

32:04.942 --> 32:07.014
The Musketeers found these

32:07.015 --> 32:09.414
inside the Settlement.

32:11.524 --> 32:13.189
Then the prisoners are guilty.

32:13.557 --> 32:18.256
No, the sacks were put there
after their arrest, Your Honour.

32:18.257 --> 32:23.556
Then, Your Honour, obviously
other refugees are involved.

32:23.898 --> 32:26.676
They are bound together by
common grievances.

32:26.677 --> 32:29.545
I doubt they would
murder one of their own.

32:29.546 --> 32:30.711
Murder, Treville?

32:30.932 --> 32:33.763
A woman of the settlement
named Clementine.

32:33.764 --> 32:36.391
The Musketeers found her body
close to the hidden evidence.

32:36.392 --> 32:41.270
Then perhaps the prisoners are innocent,
and the real thieves are still at large?

32:41.334 --> 32:42.599
Without doubt.

32:42.600 --> 32:46.228
Further evidence against the prisoners

32:46.254 --> 32:48.060
may still come to light.

32:48.622 --> 32:51.418
Until it does, there
will be no executions.

32:53.476 --> 32:55.665
Everybody will abide by the rule of law,

32:56.895 --> 33:00.345
prisoners, ministers and governors.

33:55.686 --> 33:57.979
I believe that belongs to the king.

34:00.185 --> 34:02.479
I've never killed a Musketeer.

34:04.517 --> 34:05.695
You never will.

34:56.051 --> 34:57.880
We need to get out of here.

34:57.881 --> 34:59.213
More will come.

34:59.214 --> 35:01.213
Let them come.

35:01.214 --> 35:02.913
They're Musketeers.

35:03.538 --> 35:07.338
I want the man who brought them here.

36:00.738 --> 36:02.404
You think you can sell my

36:02.405 --> 36:05.010
grain on the streets of
Paris, and I won't know?

36:06.338 --> 36:09.946
Wasn't I paying enough for the
use of your wagons, Nortier?

36:11.272 --> 36:14.338
You have to steal from me too?

36:21.708 --> 36:25.374
Your greed led the Musketeers

36:25.805 --> 36:28.237
straight to my store.

36:28.238 --> 36:30.871
I'll pay you.

36:30.872 --> 36:32.897
Everything you lost...

36:32.898 --> 36:34.230
More!

36:34.231 --> 36:37.423
I grew up following the
troops across every stinking,

36:37.424 --> 36:39.622
cess-pit battlefield there was,

36:39.623 --> 36:43.102
fighting for scraps just to survive.

36:43.103 --> 36:47.368
I learnt never to let anything go.

36:49.279 --> 36:52.170
No matter how hard they bite,

36:52.731 --> 36:56.796
scratch or tear,

36:56.797 --> 37:00.162
you hold on to what is yours.

37:18.030 --> 37:20.099
Take his horse to my stables.

37:23.154 --> 37:27.153
You arrested the refugees
on false charges.

37:27.154 --> 37:30.286
A good man died.

37:31.151 --> 37:34.326
Won't your little wife be
wondering where you've got to?

37:34.327 --> 37:36.458
You fabricated evidence,

37:37.119 --> 37:39.398
killed an innocent woman
to cover your tracks,

37:39.399 --> 37:43.531
took the prisoner Léon
when all else failed.

37:44.287 --> 37:46.419
No doubt someone somewhere

37:47.064 --> 37:49.530
is beating a confession out of him.

37:49.531 --> 37:51.964
Where is he?

38:06.639 --> 38:07.920
You!

38:09.831 --> 38:13.730
You're a Red Guard,
one of Feron's spies.

38:13.731 --> 38:15.736
Go back to the gutter, Sylvie.

38:16.644 --> 38:19.044
We trusted you.

38:34.465 --> 38:35.686
- Sylvie...
- Léon!

38:37.482 --> 38:40.631
I will make sure that justice is done.

38:40.632 --> 38:44.449
Do you really expect me to
believe that after everything

38:44.450 --> 38:48.390
that's happened to my friends,

38:48.415 --> 38:50.383
my own father?

38:52.489 --> 38:55.506
Take this burden upon yourself,
and it will never lift.

38:56.570 --> 38:59.979
Revenge yourself, and a
part of you dies with him.

39:10.069 --> 39:13.201
An honourable death.

39:13.958 --> 39:15.279
What have you done?

39:15.280 --> 39:16.581
He betrayed us!

39:16.582 --> 39:18.458
He betrayed my father!

39:18.459 --> 39:20.192
You can not do that!

39:20.193 --> 39:24.692
We put this man inside the
settlement some months ago.

39:25.398 --> 39:27.663
He's been most useful, but

39:28.714 --> 39:33.180
too much time in low company
must have corrupted him.

39:33.181 --> 39:36.244
He obviously saw an opportunity
to organize the theft

39:36.245 --> 39:38.809
of Beaufort's grain,

39:39.504 --> 39:42.004
blame the refugees.

39:43.771 --> 39:45.581
Do you take us for fools?

39:53.076 --> 39:56.473
Your death will not be honourable.

39:59.052 --> 40:00.514
Not today.

40:05.494 --> 40:06.751
Not today.

40:12.239 --> 40:14.663
Marcheaux is a disgrace to his uniform.

40:14.894 --> 40:16.460
He should be court-martialled.

40:16.461 --> 40:17.693
Whatever you think he may

40:17.694 --> 40:20.193
have done, you don't have any proof.

40:20.194 --> 40:23.108
You say the alleged Red
Guard agent is dead?

40:23.109 --> 40:24.840
Shot by Captain Marcheaux.

40:24.841 --> 40:26.537
An unfortunate accident.

40:26.593 --> 40:30.390
The Musketeers' intervention was
directly responsible for the tragedy.

40:30.391 --> 40:31.223
That's a lie.

40:31.637 --> 40:33.204
The prisoners are to be released.

40:33.739 --> 40:35.735
But where is the grain?

40:35.761 --> 40:37.156
You want grain?

40:46.461 --> 40:48.060
We've got plenty.

40:48.986 --> 40:50.761
Will you tell the king, Feron?

40:50.762 --> 40:53.061
Or shall I?

40:58.028 --> 41:00.227
Time to get up, darling.

41:00.854 --> 41:02.863
The day's begun.

41:06.194 --> 41:09.827
Mama is coming to get you.

41:09.828 --> 41:11.994
Oh.

41:13.830 --> 41:15.562
I didn't realize you were here.

41:16.551 --> 41:19.088
Yes, I like to be here when he wakes up.

41:19.089 --> 41:21.720
Come, give Papa a kiss.

41:21.721 --> 41:24.488
Good morning, Papa.

41:35.355 --> 41:36.387
Hmm.

41:36.909 --> 41:40.162
Doesn't my little prince
want his mama this morning?

41:40.163 --> 41:42.095
Poor Mama.

41:42.096 --> 41:43.862
I will leave you, then.

41:45.457 --> 41:47.622
I did not tell you,

41:47.623 --> 41:49.889
the Musketeers have returned to Paris,

41:49.890 --> 41:51.956
all four of them.

41:52.588 --> 41:57.020
It seems the life of a celibate
monk didn't suit Aramis.

41:57.021 --> 42:00.446
I'm sure we all could've told him that.

42:00.447 --> 42:03.713
Don't you think, my dear?

42:13.342 --> 42:15.637
I was mad to believe this
deception of yours would work.

42:15.860 --> 42:19.093
We should have taken the King's
money when it was offered.

42:19.629 --> 42:23.377
But, my dear sir, you've got your grain.

42:23.378 --> 42:25.960
And Louis will pay you in the usual way.

42:25.961 --> 42:28.612
The king wants a gesture.

42:29.017 --> 42:33.659
He wants me to give it to the
people of Paris. All of it!

42:33.660 --> 42:35.721
The Musketeers have taken everything!

42:35.722 --> 42:37.584
Feron and I will deal with them.

42:37.585 --> 42:40.283
Did that creature just speak to me?

42:40.560 --> 42:41.959
Did he have the audacity to open

42:41.960 --> 42:43.426
his mouth in my presence after

42:43.427 --> 42:46.393
everything he has put me through?

42:46.804 --> 42:50.511
If I ever see either you or that...

42:50.512 --> 42:56.046
thing again, you'll regret it.

43:08.447 --> 43:11.379
I told you, Grimaud.

43:11.380 --> 43:15.079
He is a favourite of the king's,

43:16.469 --> 43:20.702
a very important man.

43:41.883 --> 43:44.139
Are you listening to me?

43:45.483 --> 43:48.916
Control at all times, Feron.

44:03.480 --> 44:04.768
Thank you.

44:06.649 --> 44:09.182
So you mean to stay here?

44:09.638 --> 44:11.892
Well, there's no reason to leave now.

44:13.938 --> 44:15.937
Be careful.

44:15.938 --> 44:18.771
I don't do careful.

44:26.205 --> 44:28.905
You know where I am.

44:49.569 --> 44:52.158
She told me she was choosy
about who she kisses.

44:52.159 --> 44:53.511
Well, she can't be that choosy.

44:53.512 --> 44:54.878
Quite the opposite.

45:03.949 --> 45:06.381
I hear the people of Saint
Antoine have you to thank for

45:06.382 --> 45:08.368
the return of their stolen grain.

45:08.369 --> 45:09.468
Mm.

45:10.375 --> 45:13.475
I'd like to shake your hand.

45:15.576 --> 45:17.475
Fine animal.

45:17.842 --> 45:19.504
Andalusian?

45:21.302 --> 45:24.074
Recently acquired, a bargain,

45:24.861 --> 45:26.001
practically stole it.

45:29.904 --> 45:32.470
Have we met?

45:33.067 --> 45:35.824
No, I am a concerned citizen.

45:39.191 --> 45:43.491
Perhaps our paths will cross again.
