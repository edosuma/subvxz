00:55.430 --> 00:57.340
Okay.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.350
Hi.

01:00.510 --> 01:01.560
- Holly. - Eric.

01:01.720 --> 01:03.270
- Messer. - Messer.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.580
Messer. Yeah, everybody calls me Messer.

01:05.580 --> 01:07.940
Well, it's nice to finally meet you, Messer.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.230
- Am I late? - Um, just an hour.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.010
But, you know, I just finished getting ready,

01:12.010 --> 01:13.900
and Alison said it was your m.o., so....

01:14.070 --> 01:15.920
Peter said you'd probably say something.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.280
Ha, ha. Oh, did he? Oh, okay.

01:19.820 --> 01:21.910
- Neat. Should we go? - Yeah, yeah, let's go.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.820
Yeah, let's get some dinner.

01:23.820 --> 01:26.370
I'm super hungry. It's been like an hour.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.580
So l hear you just moved to Atlanta.

01:28.750 --> 01:29.920
Yep.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.750
- How long have you known Pete for? - High school.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.130
Oh, wow.

01:34.840 --> 01:35.960
Oh, thank you.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.070
I've known Alison since college.

01:38.070 --> 01:39.260
We were in a sorority together.

01:39.430 --> 01:42.390
- Where's your car? - Right here.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.560
Here you go.

01:46.100 --> 01:47.350
Come on.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.940
Hold on tight. I promise I won't read into it.

01:51.650 --> 01:54.320
-I'm not really dressed for 40-mile-an-hour-- -What?

01:54.480 --> 01:56.360
I'm not really dressed for 40-mile-an-hour winds.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.490
Sorry. I just--

01:59.660 --> 02:00.970
You know, I don't even think

02:00.970 --> 02:03.030
I could really get my leg up over it, so....

02:03.200 --> 02:04.200
But I'll drive.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.330
My car's right here. And it's new, so l love driving it.

02:08.750 --> 02:11.250
- It's a sweet ride. - Thanks.

02:11.420 --> 02:12.880
Hop in.

02:20.680 --> 02:21.720
All right.

02:23.470 --> 02:25.680
So where shall we go?

02:26.220 --> 02:29.270
Uh, where did you make the reservations?

02:29.440 --> 02:32.020
That you said you were gonna make. You didn't make them?

02:32.190 --> 02:34.060
- I said that? -It's cool. Whatever.

02:34.230 --> 02:36.530
Yeah, it's cool. We can go anywhere, I don't care.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.190
We can-- You pick it.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.860
We'll grab a table and we'll just slide right in.

02:45.030 --> 02:47.160
-Sounds good. -My friend from culinary school is the--

02:47.330 --> 02:49.870
Pull over, that ass is too fat

02:50.040 --> 02:51.460
- It's just my cell phone. - I figured.

02:51.620 --> 02:53.920
- You can answer it if you-- - No, no, it'll go to voicemail.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.340
Okay.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.360
Yeah, well, I was just saying

02:58.360 --> 03:01.430
my friend from culinary school is actually the--

03:02.050 --> 03:04.390
You know what? Go ahead, just answer it, it's fine.

03:04.550 --> 03:08.100
- I'm-- I can wait. - All right. Yeah. It's a little too loud.

03:09.850 --> 03:12.100
Hey, you.

03:13.940 --> 03:17.230
Well, you know me, always in the middle of something.

03:17.820 --> 03:19.860
Yeah, okay, yeah. Eleven?

03:20.030 --> 03:23.780
Yeah. You know what? Why don't we make it 10:30?

03:24.530 --> 03:26.450
All right. All right, later.

03:26.620 --> 03:28.080
Okay.

03:29.620 --> 03:33.670
I'm sorry, it's a.... it's a sick friend.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.460
You know, we don't have to do this.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.420
Really?

03:40.380 --> 03:43.470
- Okay. -Oh, my God, are you serious?

03:43.640 --> 03:44.800
Okay, let's be honest.

03:44.970 --> 03:47.390
You knew the moment you saw me you didn't like me.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.250
But our mutual friends set this up,

03:49.250 --> 03:50.850
so I think we owe it to them to--

03:51.020 --> 03:53.890
To what, spend a few hours faking small talk?

03:54.060 --> 03:57.270
Look, best case, we get drunk and we hook up.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.570
What kind of an asshole are you?

03:59.730 --> 04:02.320
Look, it's a Saturday night. I just wanna have some fun.

04:02.490 --> 04:06.990
I can go see my sick friend, and you can go do...

04:07.330 --> 04:09.740
...whatever it is you like to do on a Saturday night.

04:09.910 --> 04:12.870
You look like you read. You can go read a book.

04:13.040 --> 04:16.459
-Do you blog? -Do my blog? Okay. You know what?

04:16.630 --> 04:17.930
If you wanted to ensure that

04:17.930 --> 04:20.209
this wasn't gonna be a lousy night, here's a tip:

04:20.380 --> 04:22.970
Don't show up an hour late, and don't make a booty call in front of me.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.800
- She's sick. - Oh, right.

04:24.970 --> 04:27.720
Were you going to heal her with your magic penis?

04:28.850 --> 04:30.390
Okay.

04:30.930 --> 04:33.300
Fine. If you wanna go out, we'll go out--

04:33.300 --> 04:34.310
Oh, my God, no.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.520
I'm not going out with you now. What are you, crazy?

04:37.690 --> 04:40.690
Get out of my car. Get out of my Smart car.

04:42.860 --> 04:45.610
- I don't know what Pete and Alison were thinking. - Me neither.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.030
Alison, oh, my God. The only way you can make this up to me...

04:50.200 --> 04:52.240
...is if you promise I never have to see him again.

04:57.420 --> 05:00.960
Really, you are like the most important woman in my life...

05:01.130 --> 05:05.340
...and Alison is the sister I never had.

05:05.840 --> 05:10.720
And I love you so much, and I'm so grateful for you and Peter.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.930
Look at Mess. in back.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.870
Anyway, I was just trying to say how excited I am for you--

05:32.040 --> 05:33.450
I love you. Alison.

05:33.620 --> 05:35.870
Messer, it's my turn.

05:35.870 --> 05:38.120
It's my turn. You already gave your speech.

05:38.290 --> 05:39.920
- Are you maid of honor? - Yes.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.710
Can we switch you guys out? I need you next to the bride.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.430
Get right in here with you guys.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.720
Don't touch me. I knew you were gonna do that.

05:52.890 --> 05:55.180
Don't touch me. Don't encourage him.

05:55.350 --> 05:59.440
Stop it. I swear to God. Stop.

05:59.940 --> 06:02.150
I'm sorry, I can't stand next to him.

06:03.190 --> 06:07.440
Hey, guys. Here we are at the holiday party. Holly, Ben.

06:07.610 --> 06:08.900
Here you go.

06:09.070 --> 06:10.990
How's that first date going, guys?

06:11.620 --> 06:13.490
I mean, what really happened? Tell me.

06:14.870 --> 06:16.870
Yo, Mess. Mess.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.500
- She has work to do. - Dude. Dude.

06:18.660 --> 06:21.000
- Help me. Take the camera. - Give me the camera.

06:22.210 --> 06:23.250
Whoa, check it out.

06:23.420 --> 06:25.420
Come here. Look at Alison's bun in the oven.

06:25.590 --> 06:28.880
Bun in the oven. Excuse me, guys. All right? Honey?

06:29.050 --> 06:31.680
Well, well, look at that.

06:31.840 --> 06:35.060
- She's my daughter. - Won't be long now.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.220
Don't squeeze the belly.

06:37.640 --> 06:37.780
Hey, Holly. What's this?

06:41.730 --> 06:45.270
Come on, just a little Christmas kiss. Just give him a--

06:45.440 --> 06:47.570
Great. Yay, happy holidays.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.110
You are an asshole.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.450
Hi, baby girl.

06:51.610 --> 06:53.160
Hi. Oh, my gosh.

06:54.530 --> 06:55.740
Baby.

06:55.910 --> 06:57.370
Hold on, Messer, I just got her.

06:57.540 --> 06:59.250
- She's with Aunt Holly now. - Dude.

06:59.410 --> 07:03.000
- Careful, Messer. Gently. - I got her. I got her.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.210
- Honey. - I'm just playing.

07:06.380 --> 07:07.710
- It's not funny. - She's fine.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.550
She's like a little football.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.510
Would you stop it? Messer. Messer.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.090
- Okay. - Stop it, seriously.

07:19.020 --> 07:22.390
Cats have kittens

07:22.850 --> 07:25.650
Doggies have pups

07:27.020 --> 07:30.610
Horses have pretty foals

07:30.860 --> 07:34.610
And sheep have lambs

07:35.030 --> 07:38.620
Cows have calves and I bet you didn't know

07:38.790 --> 07:42.160
That elephants have calves too

07:42.870 --> 07:45.330
Lions and leopards have cubs

07:45.920 --> 07:51.130
Which is the proper thing for them to do

07:56.850 --> 07:59.680
She's gonna blow if you keep doing that. She's in a puking phase.

07:59.850 --> 08:02.060
No, she loves it.

08:02.230 --> 08:03.640
She loves it, don't you, Soph?

08:03.810 --> 08:06.400
You're the only girl I'll ever shave for. You know that?

08:06.560 --> 08:08.100
Speaking of, why didn't Liz come?

08:08.100 --> 08:09.730
I thought you were getting serious.

08:09.900 --> 08:12.860
No, we ended that a few weeks ago. It wasn't working out.

08:13.030 --> 08:14.570
- What happened? - I don't know.

08:14.740 --> 08:17.740
I just didn't see us on that long march towards death together.

08:17.910 --> 08:19.950
Oh, my bad. I thought you liked this girl.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.950
That was you. I just thought she was hot.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.660
Honey, don't forget to tip the castle guys.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.000
They show up late and made me do the work.

08:29.170 --> 08:32.380
But, sure, let's tip the castle guys.

08:32.549 --> 08:35.260
So I started taking Sophie to this new family practice.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.929
There's this doctor there. He's so cute.

08:40.100 --> 08:44.100
I may have finally replaced my Anderson Cooper crush.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.480
- Anyway, l noticed no ring... - Scoot.

08:47.650 --> 08:49.940
...so I started a conversation with his nurse.

08:50.110 --> 08:51.780
- No. - I pretended to like her nails.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.870
No. We agreed to a moratorium on setups.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.570
How do you know you won't like him?

08:55.740 --> 08:57.780
You have the worst setup track record ever.

08:57.950 --> 09:00.700
-Like who? -The shoplifter. Adult-braces guy.

09:00.870 --> 09:03.870
Unbelievable. You're still holding that over me.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.870
I'm not even gonna get into the Messer Debacle of '07.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.420
Well, that was Peter. I hardly even knew him then.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.420
You knew he called himself Messer. And you're my best friend.

09:12.590 --> 09:13.620
You can't be like those

09:13.620 --> 09:15.720
women who judge me because l don't wear a ring.

09:15.880 --> 09:16.930
I'm not.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.430
In the meantime, you keep having gorgeous babies...

09:19.600 --> 09:22.220
...and I will keep spoiling them with this.

09:22.390 --> 09:24.890
Seriously, that's better than my wedding cake.

09:25.060 --> 09:27.480
- I made your wedding cake. - It was a little dry.

09:28.810 --> 09:31.400
Don't let any fat grown-ups in while the kids are inside.

09:33.070 --> 09:34.820
Have you guys been smoking marijuana?

09:34.990 --> 09:37.200
-That's illegal. -You're stoned.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.190
What are you holding? Let me see it.

09:39.190 --> 09:41.120
Come on, you want me to call the cops?

09:41.280 --> 09:43.620
Please don't. My dad's a pastor.

09:45.910 --> 09:48.830
All right, I'm taking this. Next time, you guys are gonna be trouble.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.580
- Now go on, get out of here. - That's--

09:50.750 --> 09:52.420
- Go on, get out of here. - Get out of here!

09:52.590 --> 09:55.130
- I bought that stuff. - Totally unacceptable.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.130
Delivery kids show up stoned out of their minds.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.840
- Who needs a dealer? - Aren't you respectable now?

10:01.010 --> 10:03.600
Relax. Once a year, under the right circumstances...

10:03.760 --> 10:05.680
...Alison and I like to relive our youth.

10:05.850 --> 10:06.890
- Once a year? - Yeah--

10:07.060 --> 10:09.730
- Yeah, right. Once a year. - All right, maybe twice a year.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.810
Wanna go? Come on, come on.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.040
Messer, do not bounce her too much.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.860
She's fine. She loves it, look at her.

10:16.030 --> 10:18.700
- Mess, l'm warning you. - Come on, she's fine.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.780
Oh, my God. She--

10:22.700 --> 10:24.030
Oh, my God.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.730
Don't worry, Sophie,

10:26.730 --> 10:29.370
you're not the first girl to throw up on Uncle Messer.

10:29.540 --> 10:32.080
Hey, Sophie, look. Look, that's what bitter looks like.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.730
Messer, go up to Peter's closet

10:33.730 --> 10:35.880
and grab something before everyone gets here.

10:36.050 --> 10:37.760
-Why, what time is it? -It's 11 .

10:37.920 --> 10:39.600
Though it's only 10 in Messer time.

10:39.610 --> 10:41.430
You know, I'm surprised you're even up.

10:41.930 --> 10:43.580
You keep your watch on during sex, don't you?

10:43.580 --> 10:45.510
At least I don't wear my baseball cap everywhere.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.850
You can take it off now, Messer. We all know about the receding hairline.

10:49.020 --> 10:51.600
It's a widow's peak. I don't have a receding hairline.

10:51.770 --> 10:54.440
Hey, baby's birthday. Neutral corners. Take a glass.

10:54.860 --> 10:57.400
First birthday, you can take your hat off for pictures.

10:57.570 --> 10:59.570
- There it is. - Before everyone gets here...

10:59.740 --> 11:01.860
...we wanted to toast Sophie's two favorite people.

11:02.030 --> 11:03.070
And our best friends.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.560
We made it through her first

11:04.560 --> 11:06.830
year with most of our sanity thanks to you guys.

11:06.990 --> 11:09.200
- We love you guys. - Are you crying?

11:09.370 --> 11:10.460
Mother's cry.

11:12.210 --> 11:14.880
- Thank god, the babysitter's here. - Why do you need a babysitter? We're both here

11:15.040 --> 11:16.250
Because she's a genius.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.760
When Sophie goes nuclear, she the only one who can calm her down.

11:18.920 --> 11:22.130
- We call her the baby whisperer. - Oh, the baby whisperer, huh?

11:22.300 --> 11:24.970
- Hey, is she hot? - Totally hot.

11:25.140 --> 11:29.520
- What's wrong with you? - Hey, everybody, this is Amy.

11:30.140 --> 11:33.140
- Hello, Amy. - Look who's here.

11:33.310 --> 11:35.020
Sophie.

11:35.400 --> 11:38.270
Let's go get you changed, hm?

11:38.440 --> 11:40.280
Thank you.

11:40.440 --> 11:43.280
Are you serious? That's the baby whisperer?

11:43.450 --> 11:44.500
Really, if she was old

11:44.500 --> 11:46.740
enough to have sex with Peter, I'd be obsolete.

11:46.910 --> 11:49.990
You'll never be obsolete, babe. Come here.

11:50.540 --> 11:53.080
Oh, my God. Could you step away? You reek of baby puke.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.000
Oh, really?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.340
- You do. Get away from me. - Excuse me.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.210
You've all met before.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.060
You met before. Remember Sophie?

12:01.060 --> 12:03.090
I can't believe you guys have four now.

12:03.260 --> 12:06.890
- Did she have any tearing? - Oh, yeah, stem to stern.

12:07.050 --> 12:09.470
They had to crack that woman open like a lobster.

12:09.640 --> 12:12.480
Excuse me. Excuse me, miss, are you the caterer?

12:12.640 --> 12:14.770
Yes, and Alison's friend.

12:14.940 --> 12:17.060
Okay, because you need to come and sit here.

12:17.230 --> 12:20.570
Okay? You need to come over here right now and sit down.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.490
Someone is in trouble...

12:22.650 --> 12:25.160
...because you make food to die for.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.360
Thank you.

12:26.530 --> 12:28.280
- I was a real jock back in college. - Yeah?

12:28.450 --> 12:30.580
A sprinter.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.540
- Really? - Yeah, ran a 4.2 40.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.830
- Wow, that's fast. - Yeah, it's fast.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.170
How else do you think l snagged Miss Pennsylvania here?

12:37.330 --> 12:40.750
- Who's talking about me? Okay. - Oh, here she is.

12:40.920 --> 12:44.630
Okay, that's good for now. So who is this? Hi, I'm Beth.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.010
- Messer. - Nice to meet you.

12:46.180 --> 12:48.140
- Nice to meet you. - We have not met before.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.050
I would remember this face of his.

12:50.220 --> 12:51.680
If you've got a loving partner,

12:51.680 --> 12:53.600
you can get through anything. Hey, Scott!

12:53.770 --> 12:54.930
- Yeah, I'm-- - Scott!

12:55.100 --> 12:56.560
- Hold that. Hold on. - Hey, Scott.

12:56.730 --> 12:58.610
- I was trying to get the boys fed. - Okay.

12:58.770 --> 13:00.250
I think Conner may have gotten

13:00.250 --> 13:02.820
himself into a little trouble, you know what I mean?

13:02.990 --> 13:05.240
- Okay, okay. - This is my husband, Scott.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.610
- Hi, how are you? - It's nice to meet you. Holly.

13:07.780 --> 13:10.200
Okay. I left those diapers in the car.

13:10.580 --> 13:11.620
We used to have sex.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.450
We used to have sex all the time, you know, everywhere.

13:14.620 --> 13:15.660
Everywhere.

13:15.830 --> 13:18.630
Then the baby needs to be fed, the kids need to be asleep...

13:18.790 --> 13:19.990
...and they have to have

13:19.990 --> 13:22.380
slept the night before or else you're exhausted.

13:22.550 --> 13:25.840
- Hi, I'm Ted's partner, Gary. - Busted.

13:26.010 --> 13:28.550
No, I'm actually single, I'm....

13:28.720 --> 13:32.510
- It's just me. - Okay, okay.

13:32.680 --> 13:36.060
Well, you serve good meats and cheeses.

13:36.230 --> 13:38.850
- I think we were all talking about that. - Thank you.

13:39.020 --> 13:44.320
That's something. I think that's good to have as a skill.

13:44.860 --> 13:47.280
- Did you wrap those? - Yes, I did.

13:47.450 --> 13:51.240
Look at that. She wraps. I don't touch meat.

13:51.410 --> 13:53.160
Only with my lips.

13:53.410 --> 13:58.790
Happy birthday, dear Sophie

13:59.290 --> 14:04.050
Happy birthday to you

14:13.640 --> 14:16.100
Guys, l want a picture of Sophie with her godparents.

14:16.270 --> 14:17.810
Okay.

14:17.980 --> 14:19.310
- Amazing. - She looks excited.

14:19.480 --> 14:20.520
Picture.

14:20.690 --> 14:23.110
All right, on three say, "Messer has a widow's peak."

14:23.270 --> 14:24.730
One, two....

14:24.900 --> 14:26.940
- Cheese. - Sophie.

14:33.780 --> 14:37.000
Is it a good party? You want some cake?

15:15.490 --> 15:17.580
You wanna get a late breakfast?

15:17.750 --> 15:21.580
No, I can't. I got a game in an hour. I gotta go shower.

15:24.750 --> 15:28.170
- Mm. Are you sure about that? - Yeah, I'm sure. There's coffee.

15:28.340 --> 15:31.340
Oh, and mugs are in the cabinet.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.030
- Ooh. This looks delicious. - It's not ready.

15:50.190 --> 15:52.400
- I'm just taking a bite. - The crumb is too fine.

15:52.570 --> 15:54.990
- I should've gone with Ceylon cinnamon. - Oh, my God.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.410
- Cassia's just wrong. - You're a genius. You are.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.470
You may be bipolar, but you're a genius.

15:59.470 --> 16:01.500
I swear, l would eat them out of the trash.

16:01.660 --> 16:03.790
- I would, they're so good. -That's nasty.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.540
Hey, Free-Range Turkey's here.

16:06.710 --> 16:08.220
Where you going? See, l knew it.

16:08.220 --> 16:09.880
You do this every time he comes in.

16:10.050 --> 16:12.920
- I know you get excited. - I'm just trying to be responsible.

16:13.090 --> 16:14.880
I'm gonna take over here. Thank you.

16:15.050 --> 16:17.600
You don't act like this when Old Man Johnson comes in.

16:17.760 --> 16:20.310
- Don't be a smart-ass. Go fix your cookies. - Okay.

16:21.310 --> 16:23.020
Let me guess.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.480
- Free-range turkey on baguette? - I'm getting predictable, huh?

16:26.650 --> 16:28.720
Well, I like to think of it as dependable.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.400
It's been 35 of the same sandwich.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.070
- Hm. You're counting? - Ish. Thirty-five-ish.

16:34.240 --> 16:35.990
You know, there are other things

16:35.990 --> 16:38.620
on the menu if you'd like to try something else.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.740
- Surprise me. - Okay. All right, great.

16:40.910 --> 16:42.750
- Do you like croissants? - I do, yeah.

16:42.910 --> 16:45.250
Good, then I've got just the thing.

16:49.130 --> 16:50.630
How come you don't wear one

16:50.630 --> 16:52.960
of those white coats with your name on it?

16:53.130 --> 16:54.220
So l'd know what it is.

16:54.380 --> 16:56.550
- It's Holly. - Holly. Sam.

16:57.090 --> 17:00.140
- Nice to meet you. - We met 35 sandwiches ago.

17:00.310 --> 17:02.180
Thirty-six now.

17:05.480 --> 17:09.109
- Thanks. Keep the change. - Oh, thanks.

17:09.270 --> 17:11.569
Sure you don't wanna throw your card in the bowl?

17:11.730 --> 17:13.440
Winner gets a free lunch.

17:14.650 --> 17:16.150
How about a free dinner on me?

17:22.450 --> 17:25.329
Be cool, be cool. Let him get out the door. Damn.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.750
- Go. - Okay. Oh, no.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.750
Which one was it? Okay, that's a Benjamin. Oh, there's a Sam.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.010
I could pick one for you.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.300
How many Sams are there in this city?

17:35.470 --> 17:39.090
And the Atlanta Hawks trying to work it out over the other side.

17:39.260 --> 17:41.260
Come on, people, let's bump up the energy.

17:41.430 --> 17:43.180
It's an exciting game here. Come on. Ready 7.

17:43.350 --> 17:45.180
- And he scores. - Go 7.

17:45.350 --> 17:47.760
Simon, I need shooting percentages.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.100
Ready 8. Let's zoom in on 8.

17:49.270 --> 17:51.310
More, more, more. Yep, right there. Go 8.

17:51.480 --> 17:55.650
Ready 2. And go 2. Ready 6. Where's my 6?

17:55.820 --> 17:58.650
The Hawks are about to press. We should stay in the backcourt.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.280
...pass inbound. Stolen by Bibby to Smith underneath.

18:01.450 --> 18:02.580
Nice. Good call, Mess.

18:02.590 --> 18:04.120
Simon, I asked for shooting percentages.

18:04.290 --> 18:07.330
Let's go. You're too ugly not to be smarter. Come on, let's go.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.420
-I hate him so much. - Ready 4.

18:10.580 --> 18:13.000
I wanna frame somebody's murder on him, you know?

18:13.170 --> 18:15.840
- Fingerprints, scene of the crime. - What's that, Simon?

18:16.010 --> 18:17.670
Shooting percentages coming up, sir.

18:20.510 --> 18:23.850
Hi, Sam, this is Holly Berenson from Fraiche.

18:24.010 --> 18:28.350
I think you left your card in my bowl today for the free lunch.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.300
I hope you did,

18:29.300 --> 18:31.900
because you're one of four Sams who did this week.

18:32.060 --> 18:35.690
And if it is you and you asked me out, I accept.

18:35.860 --> 18:36.860
- If it's-- - Hello?

18:37.030 --> 18:38.860
- Hello? - Why are you calling my husband?

18:39.030 --> 18:40.790
Right, you're his wife. Of course.

18:40.930 --> 18:42.160
We're very happily married.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.530
I understand that you're happily married.

18:44.700 --> 18:47.370
Really, I didn't mean anything by it. I'm so sorry. Okay.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.290
You take care. I'm sorry.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.500
- Hi, Sam? - Yes, Samantha.

18:51.670 --> 18:55.130
Oh, Samantha. Oh, it's a Samantha. I'm sorry, I have the wrong--

18:55.300 --> 18:58.010
Maybe not. You single?

18:58.170 --> 19:00.720
I am single, yes.

19:00.880 --> 19:04.390
Hi, Sam Nelson. Dr. Sam Nelson.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.100
This is Holly Berenson from Fraiche...

19:07.270 --> 19:11.730
...and I am really hoping that you're the Sam I talked to today.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.300
If not, I'm screwed

19:13.310 --> 19:15.360
because you're the last Sam who put his card in the bowl

19:15.360 --> 19:16.230
for a free lunch.

19:17.570 --> 19:18.900
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.650
Call waiting.

19:21.530 --> 19:23.070
Hello?

19:24.660 --> 19:26.580
Yes, this is she.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.590
Excuse me. I'm looking for an Officer Young.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.260
The officer at the scene found your name and number...

19:47.430 --> 19:50.930
...on an insurance contact card in her wallet.

19:51.100 --> 19:54.600
Now, we need numbers for the nearest next of kin.

19:54.770 --> 19:55.940
Can you supply those?

19:56.110 --> 19:58.940
Yeah. Pete's dad, um....

19:59.940 --> 20:03.070
How did you say the car flipped? It flipped when it hit the...?

20:03.240 --> 20:05.870
Are you sure you wouldn't like to sit down?

20:05.870 --> 20:07.240
They have a baby girl.

20:07.410 --> 20:10.120
Sophie. Was she in the car? Was she in the car with them?

20:10.290 --> 20:12.490
No. She was in the care of a minor,

20:12.490 --> 20:15.120
a babysitter, at the time of the accident.

20:15.290 --> 20:17.960
So the officers placed her with CPS for the night.

20:18.130 --> 20:20.210
- She's perfectly fine. - CPS?

20:20.380 --> 20:22.510
Child Protective Services.

20:22.670 --> 20:25.050
Where they take cases like this.

20:25.970 --> 20:27.350
Cases like this?

20:29.770 --> 20:31.100
Orphaned children.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.840
Messer.

21:59.150 --> 22:02.150
No, no, no. I just don't understand why we can't see her tonight.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.780
No, ma'am, I don't care about your protocol. This is--

22:06.490 --> 22:10.280
Yes, I will be here at this number. Yes.

22:11.700 --> 22:13.950
They won't do anything, not till 8 a.m. tomorrow.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.830
Okay, okay. I'm sure that she's fine.

22:17.330 --> 22:19.250
You know, why don't we sleep here tonight?

22:19.420 --> 22:21.670
That way we're here if they call early. All right?

22:21.840 --> 22:24.090
- Okay. - Why don't you take the guest bedroom?

22:24.250 --> 22:26.720
Okay, you can take their room if you want.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.840
No, thank you. I'll sleep over here.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.680
- See you in the morning. - Okay.

22:32.470 --> 22:35.220
- Thanks, Messer. - Okay.

23:30.320 --> 23:31.400
Anyone call?

23:32.860 --> 23:34.780
Just their lawyer.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.990
He's coming over now. He wants to talk to us.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.290
I'm sure this is a very difficult time for you, obviously.

23:43.460 --> 23:46.670
Everyone at the firm, we will miss Peter very much.

23:47.420 --> 23:50.170
Now, you must have many questions.

23:50.340 --> 23:52.930
Well, Sophie. I think that's who we're both thinking of.

23:53.090 --> 23:54.680
- Yes. - What will happen to her now?

23:54.850 --> 23:57.300
Okay, well, I have already arranged for her transfer.

23:57.470 --> 24:00.100
The foster family she was with will bring her to CPS.

24:00.270 --> 24:02.890
They feel she'll adjust best in her own environment...

24:03.060 --> 24:06.480
...so first she needs to be picked up and brought here.

24:06.860 --> 24:09.860
Okay, and who does that?

24:11.990 --> 24:13.610
I'm sorry, did Alison and Peter

24:13.620 --> 24:16.240
talk to you about their guardianship arrangements?

24:16.410 --> 24:17.700
- No. - No.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.720
Well, in preparing their will,

24:20.720 --> 24:23.410
we talked about who would take care of Sophie...

24:23.580 --> 24:26.040
...in the unlikely event that they should both die...

24:26.210 --> 24:29.500
...and they named you.

24:29.670 --> 24:30.710
Both of you.

24:32.380 --> 24:33.380
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

24:33.550 --> 24:34.730
They picked us together?

24:34.730 --> 24:36.840
I'm sure this isn't exactly how you wanted to start a family.

24:37.010 --> 24:39.390
There's been a misunderstanding. We are not married.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.500
No, no no. They tried to set us up on a blind date,

24:41.500 --> 24:43.390
and we never made it to the restaurant.

24:43.560 --> 24:46.770
- I don't even know if you'd call it a date. - He was such a dick.

24:46.940 --> 24:48.230
I know this is overwhelming.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.520
Okay, and believe me, I tried to advise them against it.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.940
But there are options. You can say no.

24:53.110 --> 24:57.910
Because this is a big deal. This is a child.

24:58.990 --> 25:01.080
Big commitment.

25:03.620 --> 25:05.660
Oh, my God.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.510
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:26.100 --> 25:28.600
- Sorry. - Options.

25:28.770 --> 25:31.980
You mentioned that there were some other options?

25:32.150 --> 25:34.320
Yes. We have Peter's father.

25:34.490 --> 25:37.280
- Oh. Perfect. He'd be perfect, I think. - There you go.

25:37.450 --> 25:38.430
And there's a few cousins.

25:38.430 --> 25:40.050
- You know what, I'm sorry, can I stop you there? - Cousins are always...

25:40.700 --> 25:41.210
Yeah.

25:41.700 --> 25:45.620
What if one of us, on our own, by ourselves...

25:45.790 --> 25:48.290
...chose to honor Alison and Peter's wishes on our own?

25:48.460 --> 25:50.920
Or both of us, hypothetically.

25:51.090 --> 25:53.420
They named you, so I just set up a court hearing...

25:53.590 --> 25:55.840
...to grant you temporary custody, and that's it.

25:56.010 --> 25:57.170
Now, the finances...

25:57.340 --> 26:00.050
...the estate will cover the mortgage, but that's about it.

26:00.220 --> 26:02.240
They didn't have much in the way of savings.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.980
They bought this house as an investment

26:03.980 --> 26:04.680
after Alison's mother passed away.

26:04.850 --> 26:07.310
But, you know, let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

26:07.480 --> 26:08.730
Let's just focus on Sophie.

26:08.900 --> 26:09.940
- Yes. - Right.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.090
So I suggest the two of you

26:12.100 --> 26:15.900
move in here in the interim, for Sophie.

26:17.150 --> 26:18.340
You want us to live together?

26:18.340 --> 26:19.610
Yeah. For Sophie, for now.

26:19.780 --> 26:22.400
Until you decide what you wanna do.

26:22.400 --> 26:23.620
But it's best.

26:35.960 --> 26:39.760
Okay. Sign here, Ms. Berenson.

26:45.640 --> 26:47.640
And here, Mr. Messer.

26:49.850 --> 26:52.480
- Thank you. - Oh, there she is.

26:56.280 --> 26:57.820
Hi, sweet girl.

26:57.990 --> 27:00.320
Oh, honey, it's so good to see you.

27:03.370 --> 27:05.910
I know, I know.

27:08.370 --> 27:12.500
I know. Hey, look. Hey, look.

27:12.670 --> 27:16.880
You want Uncle Messer? Here. There's Uncle Messer.

27:17.550 --> 27:20.420
Oh, God. Okay. We should get her home.

27:38.650 --> 27:40.900
They definitely didn't think this through.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.950
We need to establish a sleep schedule.

27:43.110 --> 27:45.200
- It's very important. - What?

27:45.370 --> 27:46.450
I guess.

27:46.910 --> 27:49.750
- What did you say? - I said they didn't think this through.

27:50.250 --> 27:52.480
Did Peter say anything to you? Or Alison?

27:52.490 --> 27:54.290
- 'cause they didn't tell me anything. - Nope.

27:54.460 --> 27:56.630
This is not the kind of thing you forget to mention.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.710
"Hey, Mess, you see that game where Kobe put the juke on that dude...

27:59.880 --> 28:01.340
...then hit the fadeaway jumper?

28:01.510 --> 28:04.470
Oh, and by the way, if I die, I'm gonna leave you with my kid."

28:04.640 --> 28:06.760
- It's messed up. - Alison was a planner.

28:06.930 --> 28:08.230
We are part of a plan.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.970
You wanna walk me through this plan?

28:10.140 --> 28:12.430
Are we supposed to live in this house together?

28:12.770 --> 28:14.490
Share the place, both sleep-deprived?

28:14.490 --> 28:16.440
Because I sounds like a compelling psych experiment.

28:16.610 --> 28:19.270
Assuming you and I can even afford to pay for this place.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.110
Dunn said the mortgage is covered.

28:21.280 --> 28:24.150
Well, what about the upkeep? Or the utilities or the taxes?

28:24.320 --> 28:26.320
You have any idea what the nut on the place like this?

28:26.780 --> 28:28.660
Peter was a junior partner at a law firm.

28:28.660 --> 28:30.120
I don't make this kind of cash.

28:30.290 --> 28:32.710
And what do you do? You bake scones for a living?

28:32.870 --> 28:35.250
I run a successful business, my sir. I do pretty well actually.

28:35.420 --> 28:38.000
Yeah? Well, running a baby is not like running a bakery.

28:38.170 --> 28:39.060
I didn't say it was.

28:39.060 --> 28:40.840
They're a mess. They pee on things.

28:41.010 --> 28:43.130
They bite. They're basically dogs.

28:43.300 --> 28:45.840
Except at least a dog knows not to lick the electrical sockets.

28:47.260 --> 28:49.300
She's up. She's up.

28:49.470 --> 28:53.930
- Okay, honey. Hey. Hi. - Hey. Hey, look at the sleepyhead.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.270
- Hi, honey. - Here we go.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.480
Hey, come here.

28:56.650 --> 28:58.110
- No, no, don't pick her up. - Why?

28:58.270 --> 29:00.360
Because she needs to learn how to self-soothe.

29:00.530 --> 29:03.360
- She needs to what? - Self-soothe. Soothe herself.

29:03.530 --> 29:05.350
I just read it, Messer. It's important.

29:05.350 --> 29:06.660
Let's just give it a minute.

29:06.820 --> 29:10.080
Everything's okay. Happy, happy girl.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.660
You know what? Let's just sing a song. We'll sing a song.

29:13.830 --> 29:16.500
The wheels on the bus go round and round

29:16.670 --> 29:18.830
Round and round Round and round

29:19.000 --> 29:21.630
The wheels on the bus go round and round

29:21.800 --> 29:23.840
All through the town

29:24.840 --> 29:25.970
The-- I don't know.

29:26.130 --> 29:28.470
- And then Keanu Reeves saves the bus - Nice.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.600
Saves the bus Saves the bus

29:30.760 --> 29:32.930
And then Keanu Reeves saves the bus

29:33.390 --> 29:35.180
- And then he dies - That's all I got.

29:35.350 --> 29:36.560
Does he die? I don't know.

29:36.730 --> 29:37.900
Okay. Maybe she's hungry.

29:37.900 --> 29:39.810
I think she's hungry. I'm gonna feed her.

29:39.980 --> 29:41.450
Come on, let's go eat. Come on.

29:41.450 --> 29:43.150
I thought we weren't picking her up.

29:47.780 --> 29:49.660
Okay, Sophie girl, I'm almost done, hold on.

29:49.670 --> 29:51.780
She's not a food critic. She's a 1-year-old.

29:51.950 --> 29:53.720
I'm not gonna feed her just anything.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.200
We're gonna feed you something today, Sophie, I promise.

29:55.370 --> 29:57.290
Hopefully before you're 2.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.330
So tell me,

29:59.330 --> 30:01.460
what does Sophie do to your dreams of ever meeting a guy...

30:01.630 --> 30:03.840
...and having your own baby? Thought about that?

30:04.010 --> 30:06.260
A woman your age already has a hard time

30:06.260 --> 30:08.380
competing for the few guys who don't suck.

30:08.550 --> 30:10.760
I'm sorry, did you just say a woman my age?

30:10.930 --> 30:13.560
In the dating world, you wouldn't be considered single.

30:13.720 --> 30:16.600
You know what you'd be? Complicated. Beyond complicated.

30:16.770 --> 30:18.440
You don't know anything about me, Messer.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.440
Well, I know that you can't open a childproof drawer.

30:22.070 --> 30:24.650
Oh. There it is.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.740
Why are you trying so hard to convince me not to help her?

30:28.910 --> 30:31.700
I'm not trying to. I'm just trying to do what's best for her.

30:31.870 --> 30:33.300
You're trying to do what's best for you.

30:33.310 --> 30:34.300
I'm trying to do what's best for her.

30:34.310 --> 30:37.080
OK. You know what. We're not it.

30:37.250 --> 30:38.230
They loved Sophie

30:38.240 --> 30:40.770
more than anything in the entire world and out of everyone.

30:40.770 --> 30:42.420
Messer, they picked us.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.250
They picked us.

30:46.460 --> 30:47.800
I'm coming.

30:47.970 --> 30:50.930
Check this out. I think you're gonna love it.

30:51.090 --> 30:54.220
Taste sensation. Ready?

30:56.100 --> 30:57.870
No? Come on. Just try it, Soph.

30:57.870 --> 31:00.270
Just try it. I think you're gonna love it.

31:00.770 --> 31:02.690
Just try it.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.440
Come on, Soph, give it a try.

31:05.610 --> 31:07.990
Oh, please? I've seen you eat things like this.

31:08.610 --> 31:10.700
I think you're gonna love it. Come on.

31:10.950 --> 31:13.490
Mmm. Mmm. Yum, yum, yum.

31:13.660 --> 31:16.290
There you go. Good girl, Soph--

31:28.090 --> 31:30.420
So you honestly think we're the best thing for her?

31:56.280 --> 31:58.160
- Well, it was a beautiful service. - Yeah.

31:58.330 --> 32:01.330
- I did not know that's how they met. - Oh, that story about Paris?

32:01.500 --> 32:02.750
- Are you kidding me? - Yeah.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.040
What is gonna happen with the baby? Do we know?

32:05.210 --> 32:06.790
- Oh, yeah, you didn't hear? - No.

32:06.960 --> 32:11.420
They named one of their friends, yeah. The single girl who bakes.

32:11.590 --> 32:13.510
And the super-hot one that always smells,

32:13.510 --> 32:14.680
like, so good and sweaty.

32:14.840 --> 32:17.180
- That guy. - That's interesting. So he'll be around.

32:17.350 --> 32:19.720
"Good"? What do you mean, "Good and sweaty"?

32:22.190 --> 32:23.570
Mom, thank you for being here.

32:23.570 --> 32:25.230
I couldn't have done it without you.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.620
You're welcome, honey.

32:26.620 --> 32:27.940
Do you mind watching her for another minute?

32:28.110 --> 32:30.600
- I gotta talk to Messer. It's family members. - Okay.

32:30.940 --> 32:32.400
Mess.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.160
There's a lot of them.

32:35.690 --> 32:37.740
Well, we just need to find one.

32:37.910 --> 32:39.910
So I understand you're Peter's cousins?

32:39.910 --> 32:41.700
Hey, don't climb on that. Hey, hey.

32:41.870 --> 32:43.460
- Who is that, Tyler? - Mason.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.750
Mason, take a seat right now. Let's go.

32:45.920 --> 32:48.460
- Eight kids. - Eight kids? You guys have eight kids?

32:48.630 --> 32:52.880
- Nine, dear. - Nine, right. Baseball team.

32:54.380 --> 32:58.220
- I had to come for Alison. - Yeah, thank you.

32:58.390 --> 33:01.100
- And I was on tour through Atlanta, so.... -Oh, on tour.

33:01.720 --> 33:03.810
Are you performing anywhere that I would know?

33:03.980 --> 33:05.560
I'm dancing at Juggles tonight...

33:05.730 --> 33:08.480
...and then Bush League Thursday through Monday.

33:08.650 --> 33:12.400
Oh, how exciting. That's really exciting. Yeah.

33:12.570 --> 33:15.740
It's really good for Sophie to get to see her grandfather.

33:17.070 --> 33:19.530
She looks just like Peter.

33:20.030 --> 33:22.290
I think she looks just like you.

33:22.450 --> 33:25.960
So you have a house in Miami now?

33:26.120 --> 33:28.040
Yeah, because we, you know, were hoping...

33:28.210 --> 33:31.210
...given that Sophie is your only grandchild, that....

33:31.380 --> 33:33.920
Well, it seems to make the most sense that you'd be--

33:34.090 --> 33:36.380
Okay, okay, okay.

33:36.550 --> 33:39.140
Sophie, no, no, no. Over here.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.640
Oh, I am so sorry. Okay.

33:41.810 --> 33:43.520
You okay? Okay.

33:43.890 --> 33:45.390
- Good as new. - Still breathing.

33:57.950 --> 34:01.280
Well, we could go with the nine-kids family.

34:01.700 --> 34:04.950
I mean, they clearly know how to keep a child alive.

34:07.420 --> 34:09.460
Stripper seemed nice.

34:14.170 --> 34:17.300
And the grandpa's a definite no?

34:19.679 --> 34:21.679
We're screwed.

34:22.600 --> 34:28.850
Next case, the matter of Sophie Novak, Index Number 05893-01.

34:29.020 --> 34:30.060
All right.

34:30.230 --> 34:32.650
I've read your submissions, along with the will.

34:32.820 --> 34:35.780
Given that you folks were named as guardians...

34:35.940 --> 34:38.489
...I see no reason to countermand the parents' wishes.

34:38.650 --> 34:40.280
However, permit--

34:44.290 --> 34:46.080
- Just leave it. - No, no.

34:46.250 --> 34:49.290
- They're gonna get ground into the carpet. - Guys, guys, okay.

34:49.460 --> 34:52.000
Let's leave the Goldfish. What do you say we stand up?

34:52.170 --> 34:54.840
- Okay. Okay. - Stand up. Leave them.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.880
Sorry.

34:57.670 --> 34:59.130
- I'll pick these up. - Just...

34:59.300 --> 35:00.830
Until that time, I hereby

35:00.830 --> 35:03.350
grant joint legal and physical custody...

35:03.510 --> 35:07.350
...of Sophie Christina Novak to Holly Berenson and Eric Messer.

35:08.850 --> 35:11.390
That's it? You're not gonna ask us anything?

35:11.560 --> 35:13.360
How do you know we're not dealers or pimps?

35:14.690 --> 35:18.030
- Are you drug dealers or pimps? - No, ma'am. No.

35:18.190 --> 35:19.610
Let's go.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.700
Boom. "Done, next case.

35:21.860 --> 35:24.030
Here, take a kid. No, take two, we got extra."

35:24.200 --> 35:27.160
Where is that stupid duck that she loves that drives me crazy?

35:28.540 --> 35:30.580
I don't get it, man. I've been good. Some chick says:

35:30.750 --> 35:32.450
"Messer, you can forget the condom,"

35:32.450 --> 35:34.330
I say no, and I still end up with a kid.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.170
We need to figure out a schedule. I need to work tomorrow.

35:37.340 --> 35:38.550
- Do you smell that? - What?

35:38.710 --> 35:40.180
Oh, maybe she finally pooped.Did she?

35:40.180 --> 35:42.380
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think she--

35:42.550 --> 35:44.680
What? It's not that bad.

35:44.850 --> 35:46.640
Oh, Soph.

35:46.810 --> 35:49.270
- It's a weird smell, right? - Okay.

35:50.230 --> 35:50.940
Go ahead.

35:50.940 --> 35:53.770
What? Why me? Because I'm the girl?

35:53.940 --> 35:55.230
- Yeah. - No. Uh-uh.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.940
I am not changing diapers for the next two years.

35:58.110 --> 36:01.030
- Get in there. -Okay, fine. Easy. It's not that....

36:01.200 --> 36:04.280
Something you can take off the checklist. Check.

36:06.870 --> 36:08.450
What are you doing?

36:08.620 --> 36:09.780
I don't know. It's not a bra that I'm taking off a chick,

36:09.780 --> 36:11.250
it's a diaper taking off a baby.

36:11.410 --> 36:12.890
- It's not rocket science. - Is there a box I can read?

36:12.890 --> 36:14.400
Just take the tabs off.

36:14.420 --> 36:16.630
See those little tabs? Undo them.

36:21.170 --> 36:24.130
Oh, God. Don't do that. You're gonna make me throw up.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.200
It's like Slumdog Millionaire in there.

36:26.210 --> 36:27.680
You're gonna make me throw up.

36:27.850 --> 36:29.600
She didn't eat enough to produce that.

36:29.770 --> 36:32.600
- She's getting it in her toes. - Okay, give me the wipes.

36:32.770 --> 36:33.740
Give me another one.

36:33.740 --> 36:35.310
Hurry. Get it out of her toes.

36:35.480 --> 36:36.610
What, it's like a poop suit.

36:38.190 --> 36:39.190
Oh, I got it.

36:39.190 --> 36:41.610
Messer. Don't leave me in here.

36:42.070 --> 36:43.320
Oh, God.

36:46.950 --> 36:48.620
Oh, it's burning my eyes.

36:48.780 --> 36:51.450
I'm getting the feeling this is a reconnaissance mission.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.080
No one else is thinking that.

36:53.250 --> 36:54.660
- Oh, hi. - Hi.

36:54.830 --> 36:56.250
- Hi. - Hello.

36:56.420 --> 36:58.540
- Surprise. - The athlete.

36:58.710 --> 37:00.380
- Yeah, how's it going? - My Two Dads.

37:00.550 --> 37:02.670
- What's up, buddy? - Here comes the block.

37:02.840 --> 37:03.970
What's going on?

37:04.130 --> 37:07.640
Just, you know, bringing you some covered dishes and whatnot.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.390
New parents, gotta stock the fridge.

37:09.390 --> 37:10.390
One, two, three.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.890
Just because. Ha, ha!

37:14.310 --> 37:17.100
- Come on in. - Oh, how unexpected.

37:17.270 --> 37:18.560
Hope it's not a bad time.

37:18.730 --> 37:22.280
Okay. Look at that, all clean.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.900
Hey, the neighborhood watch is here. They brought us some--

37:26.570 --> 37:29.160
What? She's perfect, no thanks to you.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.150
Holly, you have a--

37:31.150 --> 37:33.750
Save it, Messer. You big coward.

37:34.410 --> 37:36.620
Okay. Come on.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.750
- Hey. - What a surprise.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.870
Hey, guys, we weren't expecting you.

37:42.870 --> 37:43.380
What a surprise.

37:45.760 --> 37:46.930
What?

37:47.090 --> 37:49.340
Sweetie, you have shit on your face.

37:51.180 --> 37:52.560
- So.... - Yeah.

37:57.980 --> 37:59.940
- Who's hungry? - I am.

38:00.110 --> 38:01.440
- This one. - Should we dive in?

38:01.610 --> 38:04.030
- You got a little more, on the right. - Just shut up.

38:04.190 --> 38:05.190
- Okay. - I swear.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.400
I'm just trying to help.

38:11.370 --> 38:13.500
You guys doing okay? You look a little tired.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.160
That would be the not sleeping.

38:15.330 --> 38:17.080
- Doesn't show. - You don't look tired.

38:17.250 --> 38:20.170
Don't worry, because you're not gonna sleep for 1 0 years.

38:20.330 --> 38:21.380
Surprise.

38:21.540 --> 38:24.090
And you're never gonna get used to children's music.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.300
- Oh, God. - No.

38:25.460 --> 38:28.150
If l knew where The Wiggles lived,

38:28.150 --> 38:29.090
and I'm working on it...

38:29.260 --> 38:31.140
I would murder them with an AK-47.

38:31.300 --> 38:32.930
- I'm very serious. - No new parents--

38:33.100 --> 38:35.310
I don't think any of us knew what we were doing.

38:35.470 --> 38:36.770
- Not a clue. - Not a clue.

38:36.930 --> 38:38.680
I mean, we had nine months to get ready

38:38.680 --> 38:41.230
and we still screw up about half the time.

38:41.400 --> 38:44.360
- He sure does. - No, I said "We," Actually.

38:44.900 --> 38:47.030
Do you know what? I'm gonna get real serious.

38:47.190 --> 38:48.430
You gotta get two things straight.

38:48.430 --> 38:49.900
One, get a sitter.

38:50.070 --> 38:51.410
- And a backup. - Absolutely.

38:51.570 --> 38:52.950
- Yeah. - Next, important:

38:53.120 --> 38:54.940
You can never have enough paper towels.

38:54.950 --> 38:56.450
And don't shop at shop now.

38:56.620 --> 38:59.370
They're always out of milk and don't carry unscented wipes.

38:59.540 --> 39:01.500
When you order Motrin, get the dye-free.

39:01.670 --> 39:03.500
Oh, no BPAs. Sippy cups, any plastics.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.000
You don't want those chemicals.

39:05.170 --> 39:07.590
Alison wanted Sophie to go to Big Wagon Preschool...

39:07.760 --> 39:10.220
...so you may wanna think about making donations.

39:10.380 --> 39:11.430
Like, yesterday.

39:11.590 --> 39:15.180
Okay, maybe we should start to write this down.

39:22.610 --> 39:25.270
One bite, one bite, one bite.

39:32.990 --> 39:34.410
- The week. - Can't do that.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.620
- You're writing my name. - I already did--

39:36.790 --> 39:40.290
There we go. Okay, Sophie girl.

39:40.460 --> 39:41.900
Your bath time, your bath time.

39:41.900 --> 39:43.120
Oh! Okay, get the baby.

39:43.290 --> 39:45.920
- Your bath time, your bath time. - All right.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.670
All right, how about that?

39:48.840 --> 39:50.340
No?

39:51.840 --> 39:53.550
How about this one?

39:54.640 --> 39:56.140
No?

40:17.370 --> 40:19.620
Patterson with the turnaround.

40:19.790 --> 40:21.160
Yeah!

40:22.870 --> 40:25.380
What? You wanna watch something else?

40:25.540 --> 40:26.710
He shoots--

40:27.460 --> 40:29.800
No, come on, missed the....

40:31.050 --> 40:33.630
It's time to wiggle.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.070
There we go.

41:03.210 --> 41:06.120
You okay? You okay? Good. Okay. I'm sorry.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.090
Please?

41:16.300 --> 41:18.430
- She's making the poop face. - What do you mean?

41:18.600 --> 41:20.810
Poop face. Oh, God, she's gonna poop in the tub.

41:20.970 --> 41:23.020
Hurry up, hurry up. She's gonna poop on me.

41:23.180 --> 41:25.640
- I don't know how to do this. - She's gonna poop on me.

41:25.810 --> 41:27.100
You know what? Move, move.

41:27.100 --> 41:29.270
Let me do it. Here. Just take her. I got it.

41:29.730 --> 41:32.610
- Come on. I hate this thing. - There's a latch. Pull the lever--

41:32.780 --> 41:34.430
Okay. Don't start. Sorry.

41:34.430 --> 41:36.200
No, no, no, not the hat.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.280
Oh, my God, that's my hat.

41:38.450 --> 41:40.870
That's my-- I've had that hat since high school.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.500
- I'll wash it. - Oh, yeah. Oh, it's funny.

41:43.660 --> 41:46.860
Yeah, laugh it off. Laugh it off.

41:46.860 --> 41:48.920
Okay, that's real funny.

41:49.080 --> 41:51.040
Oh, God.

41:51.210 --> 41:54.090
Um, I think we should just....

42:00.470 --> 42:02.100
- Hey, what is that? - What?

42:02.260 --> 42:04.770
That lump. What's that?

42:04.930 --> 42:06.890
- That's her bellybutton. - No, it's not.

42:07.060 --> 42:09.480
That wasn't there. That was not there a few days ago.

42:09.650 --> 42:11.180
It's just an outie, isn't it?

42:11.180 --> 42:12.400
No, it's not an outie.

42:13.610 --> 42:14.940
I don't think.

42:16.950 --> 42:17.990
How does this...?

42:18.160 --> 42:21.120
What are these numbers on here? What does that mean?

42:21.280 --> 42:22.370
Why is this...?

42:24.200 --> 42:26.870
No one's gonna steal a stroller.

42:27.040 --> 42:28.520
We can't afford to be snobby.

42:28.520 --> 42:29.500
It's our biggest event.

42:29.670 --> 42:31.380
Bring out all the crowd pleasers.

42:31.540 --> 42:34.300
Anything wrapped in bacon, and the mushroom vol-au-vent.

42:34.460 --> 42:36.630
Sorry to keep you waiting.

42:37.130 --> 42:39.260
- I gotta call you back. - Holly.

42:39.640 --> 42:40.680
Free-Range Turkey.

42:41.640 --> 42:45.010
- Dr. Free-Range Turkey. - Yes, Sam. I remember.

42:45.180 --> 42:47.390
I heard about the accident.

42:47.560 --> 42:49.980
I am so sorry about your friends.

42:50.150 --> 42:51.400
Thank you.

42:51.980 --> 42:53.500
Hey, you left me a half-message,

42:53.500 --> 42:55.440
only it was the half without your number.

42:55.610 --> 42:58.320
Yeah, something-- Someone came up.

42:59.990 --> 43:02.490
- How we doing? - It's all right, sweetheart.

43:03.740 --> 43:07.410
Is she sleeping okay? Regular bowel movements?

43:07.580 --> 43:10.790
Not at first, but now very regular.

43:10.960 --> 43:13.290
But she does have this protrusion on her stomach.

43:13.460 --> 43:15.220
I don't know, you know, what it is.

43:15.220 --> 43:17.380
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to look for.

43:17.550 --> 43:20.220
I don't really know anything about kids.

43:20.380 --> 43:22.800
Alison was the first of my friends to have a baby...

43:22.970 --> 43:24.720
...and she was amazing with Sophie.

43:24.890 --> 43:26.100
And she would be the first person

43:26.100 --> 43:28.020
I would call about this, you know?

43:28.180 --> 43:29.370
I mean, she was the first person

43:29.370 --> 43:31.270
I called about everything and....

43:31.440 --> 43:34.560
God. It is killing me.

43:34.730 --> 43:36.760
It is killing me right now

43:36.760 --> 43:37.650
that I can't call my friend.

43:37.820 --> 43:39.860
She just....

43:40.030 --> 43:43.280
And I'd really like to say, "What the hell were you thinking?

43:43.450 --> 43:45.620
You could've left me your pearls or YSL clutch.

43:45.780 --> 43:47.200
I mean, this is a little much.

43:47.370 --> 43:50.870
It's really, really hard, and I don't know what I'm doing."

43:51.040 --> 43:53.210
I don't know what I'm doing.

44:00.970 --> 44:02.050
I'm sorry.

44:02.470 --> 44:04.720
No, I think you're doing pretty well, considering.

44:05.930 --> 44:09.180
Sophie's got an umbilical hernia.

44:10.060 --> 44:11.380
It's nothing to worry about.

44:11.380 --> 44:13.350
Most go away on their own. We'll watch it.

44:13.520 --> 44:14.420
Then I didn't do it?

44:14.420 --> 44:15.690
No, you did not do it.

44:15.860 --> 44:17.520
Okay.

44:20.030 --> 44:22.320
I thought you said it goes away on its own.

44:23.570 --> 44:24.660
That's for you.

44:27.580 --> 44:30.330
"One bottle of Pinot Noir, one to two glasses as needed."

44:30.500 --> 44:32.540
Or white. Same dosage, though.

44:33.420 --> 44:35.660
Look, what you're doing is pretty incredible.

44:35.660 --> 44:37.750
Give yourself a break every now and again.

44:37.920 --> 44:40.960
- Thank you. - I'll have my nurse set you up in a week?

44:41.130 --> 44:42.300
- Okay. - All right.

44:42.470 --> 44:45.130
Bye, Sophie. You're gonna be okay.

44:45.680 --> 44:48.260
- Nice to see you. - You too, really.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.850
So I'm at the drugstore...

44:52.020 --> 44:55.190
...and it dawns on me that women stare at men carrying a baby...

44:55.350 --> 44:58.360
...like a guy will stare at a woman with a great rack.

44:59.980 --> 45:02.110
You know what I just realized today?

45:02.280 --> 45:04.530
I am never gonna take a great bath in this house.

45:04.700 --> 45:07.740
This is a shower house. You never brush your hair, do you?

45:07.910 --> 45:11.120
It must save so much time. That's so handy.

45:11.290 --> 45:13.040
How's that wine treating you?

45:14.460 --> 45:15.960
- Did you want some? - No, no, no.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.500
Because I can share. I'm a good sharer.

45:18.960 --> 45:22.050
No, you don't need any, because you never worry.

45:22.670 --> 45:25.550
That's what Alison told me, you know, when she set us up.

45:25.720 --> 45:27.190
She said, "Honey, you just got

45:27.190 --> 45:29.600
your ass dumped by your boyfriend of three years.

45:29.760 --> 45:34.310
You need to go have a good time." And then, ta-da, you show up.

45:34.480 --> 45:36.060
Your charming self shows up...

45:36.230 --> 45:38.480
...and you don't even wanna go to the restaurant.

45:38.650 --> 45:40.480
My first date in three years,

45:40.480 --> 45:42.820
and it's a total asshole at the door.

45:44.320 --> 45:46.360
And now I'm raising a kid with that asshole.

45:46.530 --> 45:47.520
God, the irony.

45:47.520 --> 45:49.490
Come on, off to bed. Up, up, up.

45:49.660 --> 45:51.650
You are, you know that, right? An asshole?

45:51.650 --> 45:53.490
It feels good to say that to your face.

45:53.660 --> 45:55.630
Been saying it behind your back for years.

45:55.630 --> 45:56.910
A belligerent drunk. Great.

45:57.080 --> 45:58.330
That'll be a fun next 18 years.

45:59.670 --> 46:01.380
Everybody thinks I'm a fun drunk.

46:01.380 --> 46:03.090
Someone's at the door. Who is it?

46:03.510 --> 46:04.800
It's probably a neighbor.

46:06.130 --> 46:08.090
- Yes? - Hi, I'm Janine Groff.

46:09.090 --> 46:10.970
Your caseworker from Social Services.

46:12.140 --> 46:13.180
Yeah.

46:13.350 --> 46:15.810
You were told we'd be making a few unannounced visits.

46:18.020 --> 46:20.440
Yeah, well, this is definitely unannounced.

46:21.150 --> 46:23.440
- Just give me one minute. - May I come in? No?

46:23.610 --> 46:25.360
- Who is that? - Social Services.

46:25.530 --> 46:27.030
You got five minutes to shower...

46:27.200 --> 46:28.500
...and start acting like the

46:28.500 --> 46:30.700
responsible pain you've been since we moved in.

46:30.870 --> 46:32.990
- Okay. - Go, go, go.

46:34.410 --> 46:36.410
Upstair-- Upstairs. Your room is up here, remember?

46:37.790 --> 46:38.920
- I'm sorry. - Go, go, go.

46:39.080 --> 46:42.380
- I'm going. Stop pushing me. Don't push. - Just-- I didn't....

46:42.540 --> 46:44.670
You sure you don't wanna see the garage again?

46:44.840 --> 46:45.920
Nope, twice is my limit.

46:46.090 --> 46:49.090
I have a whole area of tools you didn't even get a chance to see.

46:49.260 --> 46:51.390
I'm good. I'm usually wrapping up by now and--

46:51.550 --> 46:55.260
Hello. I'm so sorry. I had to get the little one down.

46:58.940 --> 47:00.020
And you can see why.

47:00.020 --> 47:02.610
Take your eyes off her for one minute and, zoom!

47:02.770 --> 47:05.690
You know? Just "Tee-tee-tee-tee-tee" On her little legs.

47:06.530 --> 47:09.700
Okay, well, let's get started, then.

47:10.070 --> 47:11.950
Okay, so let's just talk.

47:12.120 --> 47:13.220
You know, I just wanna

47:13.220 --> 47:15.370
get a sense of the both of you, your plans.

47:15.540 --> 47:17.410
Where do you see yourselves in five years?

47:18.790 --> 47:20.710
- Ask me. I know. Great answer. - You don't--

47:20.870 --> 47:21.920
No, I'm good, I'm good.

47:22.080 --> 47:23.980
I own a small gourmet-food store,

47:23.980 --> 47:26.170
soon to be a small gourmet restaurant.

47:26.340 --> 47:27.160
We're expanding.

47:27.160 --> 47:29.050
New flooring, I'm thinking hexagonal tile.

47:29.220 --> 47:31.930
New flooring. That's part of everyone's five-year plans.

47:32.090 --> 47:33.090
Flooring, right?

47:33.260 --> 47:36.220
Anyway, I'm also hoping someday to have my own frozen-food line.

47:36.390 --> 47:38.140
Organic. But that's the 10-year plan.

47:38.140 --> 47:39.520
You asked about the five-year.

47:39.690 --> 47:41.350
Oh, God, l didn't include Sophie.

47:41.520 --> 47:43.310
- You didn't. - Let me just take it back.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.500
She is a big part of my plan.

47:45.500 --> 47:46.440
That's fine. Thank you.

47:47.070 --> 47:49.240
- Okay. - Eric.

47:51.030 --> 47:53.280
- Yep, Eric's good. Eric will be fine. - Okay, Eric.

47:53.780 --> 47:57.830
Well, I'm the technical director on all Hawks broadcasts.

47:58.410 --> 47:59.790
- Okay. - Yeah.

47:59.960 --> 48:01.790
So, what does the technical director do?

48:01.960 --> 48:03.790
Well, when the director says,

48:03.790 --> 48:06.380
"Ready, go Camera 1 ," I'm the guy that--

48:06.550 --> 48:10.510
- I push the button that goes Camera 1 . - He pushes the button.

48:10.970 --> 48:12.470
And I guess in a couple years...

48:12.630 --> 48:13.940
...when the boss gets kicked upstairs

48:13.940 --> 48:16.180
or gets pinched with a tranny hooker...

48:16.350 --> 48:18.560
...I'll get my shot in the director's chair.

48:20.140 --> 48:23.520
Okay. So Mr. Dunn tells me that you're both single...

48:23.690 --> 48:28.110
...and presently not engaged in a relationship.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.860
- Not sleeping together? - God, no.

48:30.030 --> 48:31.360
- Okay, good. - Oh, my God, no.

48:31.530 --> 48:33.360
- No, no, no. - Not a chance.

48:33.530 --> 48:35.620
Okay, that's great, because this situation...

48:35.780 --> 48:38.660
...two single people living under the same roof...

48:38.830 --> 48:40.880
...raising a recently orphaned child,

48:40.880 --> 48:42.660
well, it's complicated enough...

48:42.830 --> 48:46.250
...without the added complication of, you know, that.

48:46.420 --> 48:47.470
Oh, trust me, Janine,

48:47.470 --> 48:49.840
we will not be complicating anything with that.

48:50.010 --> 48:51.710
Yeah, I get plenty of that elsewhere.

48:51.880 --> 48:54.840
- I'd get plenty of that in my day as well. - Way back in the day.

48:55.010 --> 48:56.470
Listen.

48:56.640 --> 48:59.470
You two both seem like two sweet, doe-eyed people...

48:59.680 --> 49:01.810
...about to have the worst year of your lives.

49:01.980 --> 49:03.100
I'll be honest with you.

49:03.100 --> 49:04.940
Wanna make jokes about tranny hookers?

49:05.100 --> 49:06.270
Go for it, I don't care.

49:06.440 --> 49:09.070
You have no idea the types of families that I deal with.

49:09.230 --> 49:12.070
Tranny hookers? They're my good cases.

49:12.240 --> 49:13.900
The only obstacle here is you two...

49:14.450 --> 49:17.070
...and whether or not you're both cut out to be parents.

49:17.240 --> 49:18.670
What we want to avoid is

49:18.670 --> 49:21.410
Sophie losing more people that she's close to.

49:22.830 --> 49:24.350
You know, your friends

49:24.350 --> 49:27.670
thought you could do this, but I'll be honest...

49:27.830 --> 49:29.880
...I'm not so sure.

49:32.920 --> 49:36.130
How can I be hung-over if I haven't even gone to sleep yet?

49:36.300 --> 49:39.390
Look, all we have to do is put her down. We just gotta put her--

49:39.550 --> 49:44.020
She's not warm. She doesn't have a fever. She's just overtired.

49:44.180 --> 49:44.870
What time is it?

49:44.880 --> 49:47.060
It's okay, Soph. Come on, honey.

49:47.230 --> 49:49.060
I don't know. Start wearing a watch.

49:49.060 --> 49:50.980
There's gotta be somebody we can call, right?

49:51.150 --> 49:53.990
- Hey, thank you for coming over. - It's okay.

49:54.150 --> 49:57.450
Sorry about your dad. He's a pretty scary dude, huh?

49:57.740 --> 49:59.570
- Come here, Sophie. - The baby whisperer.

49:59.740 --> 50:00.780
- It's okay. - Yeah.

50:00.950 --> 50:01.990
Thank you, Amy.

50:06.920 --> 50:09.580
I don't know why, but this fan always helps.

50:09.750 --> 50:12.710
- Beats having to take her for a drive. - Yeah.

50:12.880 --> 50:15.880
Anyway, big math test tomorrow, so....

50:17.930 --> 50:19.140
Give her some money.

50:19.300 --> 50:20.850
Oh, Amy, Amy.

50:22.430 --> 50:25.140
It's okay. Doesn't feel right to take it anymore.

50:25.310 --> 50:26.430
Okay.

50:26.600 --> 50:28.440
- Give her the money. - No, I insist.

50:30.230 --> 50:32.940
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

50:33.110 --> 50:35.650
- Good luck on your math test. - Okay, bye-bye.

50:35.820 --> 50:38.780
- Oh, thank God. Whew. - I know.

50:40.370 --> 50:43.740
- Oh, no. - No, no, no.

50:44.290 --> 50:46.210
Too close. You're holding her too--

50:46.210 --> 50:47.660
Look, you're gonna chop her head off.

50:47.830 --> 50:50.170
- That's what the babysitter was doing. - She wasn't.

50:50.330 --> 50:52.750
No, she was soothing her down here.

50:52.920 --> 50:55.800
We're gonna go for a drive. We're gonna drive around the block.

50:55.960 --> 50:58.550
- Just go. Just go. - Nice and quick. Nice and quick.

50:58.720 --> 51:01.430
All right, we're just gonna go for a ride around the block.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.640
We'll get back in time for the game, huh?

51:30.000 --> 51:31.040
Hi.

51:31.370 --> 51:35.000
Mm-hm. Absolutely. Yeah, I'm on my way now. Okay.

51:35.170 --> 51:37.840
Yeah, really, thank you so much. All right, bye-bye.

51:38.010 --> 51:39.510
Yes!

51:39.670 --> 51:40.790
Yes. Burke's out,

51:40.790 --> 51:42.930
and I finally got the call to direct today's game.

51:43.100 --> 51:44.580
Today is my Riverside event.

51:44.580 --> 51:46.430
- I told you. - You never told me that.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.180
You just don't listen to women who won't sleep with you.

51:49.350 --> 51:51.810
See it there on the board? I'll be home at 7:30.

51:51.980 --> 51:54.440
Come on, I can't. There are no kids in the booth.

51:54.610 --> 51:56.860
- Come on, work with me here. - It's on the board.

51:57.030 --> 51:58.860
You have any idea how big a game this is?

51:59.030 --> 52:01.740
The Hawks are a game out of the eighth seed in the East.

52:01.910 --> 52:04.370
- Don't walk out that door. - You're speaking Mandarin.

52:04.530 --> 52:06.240
I've been planning this for months.

52:06.410 --> 52:09.330
There are plenty of mommy and daddies who are in love with you.

52:09.500 --> 52:10.540
Call them.

52:10.540 --> 52:13.540
Hey, Beth. It's Messer, from a-- Yeah.

52:13.710 --> 52:15.100
Hey, I was wondering if maybe

52:15.100 --> 52:17.210
you guys could watch Sophie for a bit today.

52:17.380 --> 52:18.860
I got a huge break.

52:18.860 --> 52:20.340
I get to direct the Hawks game today.

52:20.510 --> 52:22.470
Nope, Amy can't. She's got a big math test.

52:22.630 --> 52:25.050
Yeah, I tried Josh and Beth too.

52:25.050 --> 52:26.010
They're all busy. Bye-bye.

52:26.180 --> 52:28.220
Son of a....

52:30.980 --> 52:33.980
It's a healthier meal if you don't fry the shell.

52:34.150 --> 52:35.170
You know what I'm saying?

52:35.170 --> 52:36.610
I like my taco shells baked.

52:36.770 --> 52:38.530
Yeah, I like them soft.

52:39.110 --> 52:41.150
All right, thank you for the ride, Walter.

52:41.320 --> 52:43.530
Well, you called, I came.

52:43.530 --> 52:44.700
That's how a man makes his money, baby.

52:44.870 --> 52:46.410
What's up with my floor seats?

52:46.580 --> 52:48.830
I'm gonna give you two floor seats.

52:48.990 --> 52:51.330
All you gotta do is keep that meter running for me.

52:51.500 --> 52:52.540
- Okay. - My man.

52:52.710 --> 52:54.670
- We making another stop, baby? - Yep.

52:54.830 --> 52:57.080
- Okay. All right. - Just not yet.

52:57.250 --> 52:59.090
Not yet, not yet. the baby's in here.

52:59.090 --> 53:00.920
You left the baby...you left the baby!

53:01.090 --> 53:04.260
You left the baby! you left the baby... you left the baby.

53:04.430 --> 53:07.720
You left your baby.

53:07.890 --> 53:10.050
Look, Walter, please, I got no choice.

53:10.060 --> 53:11.770
I need your help, as a friend.

53:11.930 --> 53:14.140
No, no, no. you can't leave me with your baby.

53:14.310 --> 53:17.100
Are you on crack? I could be the baby cab killer.

53:17.270 --> 53:18.480
I know all about you, man.

53:18.650 --> 53:21.280
I know you keep a clean cab, you drive the speed limit...

53:21.440 --> 53:23.440
...and you got three kids you love to death.

53:23.610 --> 53:25.400
You know why? because they're my kids.

53:25.570 --> 53:27.200
I hate other people's kids.

53:27.200 --> 53:28.660
that's your baby in there.

53:28.830 --> 53:30.370
Whatever the meter is, triple it.

53:30.540 --> 53:32.750
You'll be the best-paid babysitter in the state.

53:32.910 --> 53:34.460
Please.

53:36.170 --> 53:37.770
What if she wakes up?

53:37.770 --> 53:38.830
She's not gonna wake up, I pro... Oh!

53:39.000 --> 53:40.380
Look. It's her ducky.

53:41.550 --> 53:43.020
ln case of an emergency.

53:43.020 --> 53:44.130
Better not be no emergencies.

53:44.300 --> 53:45.670
- There won't be. - Better not!

53:47.180 --> 53:49.430
The final seconds of this first half....

53:49.600 --> 53:52.510
Ready Camera 3. and go 3.

53:52.680 --> 53:54.350
feeding it off, and the basket....

53:54.520 --> 53:57.390
Simon, give me the scoring leaders, please.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.310
No one's ever said "Please" to me before.

54:00.980 --> 54:03.610
- Who's calling? - It's the new sitter.

54:05.240 --> 54:08.160
The baby woke up! the baby woke up.

54:08.320 --> 54:11.240
Hey, there's this great game going on. you should check it out.

54:11.410 --> 54:12.610
Cameras 4 and 6,

54:12.610 --> 54:14.160
4 ready by the ball, 2 by the basket.

54:14.330 --> 54:17.410
Okay, sniff her butt. see if she needs to be changed.

54:17.580 --> 54:19.250
I'm not sniffing this baby's booty.

54:19.250 --> 54:20.960
Man, what are you feeding this girl?

54:21.130 --> 54:22.780
It's like a dirty bomb.

54:22.780 --> 54:25.050
It's like eggs and peanut butter.

54:25.470 --> 54:26.860
l'll be down at halftime.

54:26.860 --> 54:28.130
Halftime? are you crazy?

54:28.840 --> 54:29.840
Halftime!

54:30.010 --> 54:32.930
Okay, okay, okay, here we go, man. Okay, okay. Oh, my God!

54:33.100 --> 54:36.430
Okay. Okay. all right. all right, we're halfway there, Walter.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.560
- All right, here we go. - No, no, no.

54:38.730 --> 54:40.350
No, please, listen. Walter, please.

54:40.520 --> 54:42.470
Know what? here. take the whole wallet.

54:42.470 --> 54:43.730
l don't want your wallet.

54:43.900 --> 54:45.410
You know what I want?

54:45.410 --> 54:49.320
I want a nice, comfy seat inside......next to some big-screen TVs..

54:49.490 --> 54:52.200
No kids in the booth. I'm sorry. you gotta sit out here.

54:52.370 --> 54:54.290
- Baby wanna see game? - Baby doesn't wanna.

54:54.450 --> 54:55.660
Wanna see game?

54:55.830 --> 54:57.370
Baby wanna see game.

55:05.670 --> 55:07.380
Hey, everybody.

55:07.550 --> 55:11.140
This is Sophie and her nanny, Walter.

55:12.890 --> 55:14.890
Say hi.

55:15.560 --> 55:16.770
All right, here you go.

55:16.930 --> 55:19.560
Big cushy chair, new monitors. drinks are in the fridge.

55:19.730 --> 55:21.310
No beer till after the game, okay?

55:21.480 --> 55:22.150
Nice.

55:22.150 --> 55:24.690
I never seen a game like this before. now we're talking.

55:24.860 --> 55:26.070
- So you're good? - l'm good.

55:26.230 --> 55:27.740
All right.

55:28.240 --> 55:31.410
All right, people, second half. let's do this.

55:31.570 --> 55:35.030
- Did you get him through a service? - Uh, yep.

55:37.200 --> 55:39.010
He's your cab driver, isn't he?

55:40.750 --> 55:42.920
Twenty seconds to go, Hawks down by 1 .

55:44.290 --> 55:46.170
No doubt they'll play for the last shot.

55:46.170 --> 55:48.010
All right, Camera 4, stay with Johnson.

55:48.550 --> 55:50.800
Liz, tell Camera 4 to stay with Johnson. come on.

55:50.970 --> 55:52.720
l can barely hear you, Messer.

55:52.720 --> 55:53.590
A foul? come on, man!

55:54.100 --> 55:55.220
Okay, ready Camera 6.

55:55.390 --> 55:57.720
Walter, she's crying.

55:57.720 --> 55:58.310
I know, l'm trying to watch the game.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.440
You are the worst babysitter of all time.

56:00.450 --> 56:01.850
Because I'm not a babysitter.

56:02.020 --> 56:04.100
Do something. please, I'm dying over here.

56:04.270 --> 56:07.320
All right, Camera 2, stay with Bibby Johnson.

56:07.780 --> 56:09.900
All right, stay with the shooter on Camera 2...

56:10.070 --> 56:11.360
No, I mean, Camera 1 .

56:11.530 --> 56:12.650
Stay on 1 , 1 , 1 .

56:12.820 --> 56:14.660
Camera 2, stay with the... Camera 1...

56:14.820 --> 56:17.080
Alley-oop, and the Hawks win.

56:17.240 --> 56:21.710
Unbelievable play by Atlanta. Hawks win by 1 .

56:21.870 --> 56:24.200
Hands down, the best game of the year.

56:24.210 --> 56:26.170
Too bad you all couldn't see it.

56:32.550 --> 56:34.430
But I'm a creep

56:36.970 --> 56:40.220
I'm a weirdo

56:41.600 --> 56:43.770
- What the hell...? - What are you singing to her?

56:44.940 --> 56:46.520
Everybody likes Radiohead.

56:48.020 --> 56:49.320
Do you mind?

56:52.110 --> 56:54.450
What the hell am I doing here?

56:56.240 --> 56:58.160
I don't belong here

57:02.540 --> 57:03.960
See?

57:04.120 --> 57:06.080
Told you it works.

57:14.880 --> 57:16.470
Would it kill you to...?

57:18.640 --> 57:20.970
Would it kill you to brighten the mood around here?

57:21.140 --> 57:22.310
- Yeah, it might. - Come on.

57:22.480 --> 57:24.150
Why should I pretend to be happy?

57:24.160 --> 57:25.940
I'm miserable. let me be miserable.

57:26.100 --> 57:27.560
- lt's depressing. - l don't care.

57:27.730 --> 57:30.860
Know what? I am so sick of all your dark little comments.

57:31.030 --> 57:32.190
I ruined my life for her.

57:32.360 --> 57:33.390
I'm so sorry parenting

57:33.390 --> 57:35.450
isn't as fun as you thought it was gonna be.

57:35.610 --> 57:38.070
Yeah, you're happy because your old life sucked.

57:38.240 --> 57:39.870
- My old life didn't suck. - It did.

57:40.030 --> 57:41.540
My life was great.

57:41.540 --> 57:42.700
I was my own boss,I made my own hours.

57:42.870 --> 57:44.150
I had free time.

57:44.150 --> 57:44.910
To do what? Bake more?

57:45.730 --> 57:47.170
You have no idea what a great life is.

57:47.330 --> 57:49.880
I had a great life. I went to games for a living.

57:50.040 --> 57:52.800
Okay? girls would buy me drinks and throw themselves at me.

57:52.960 --> 57:55.970
You see this shirt? I slept with the girl who sold me this shirt.

57:56.130 --> 57:57.180
You're disgusting.

57:57.340 --> 58:00.220
People say you can't have it all. I had it all. It was awesome.

58:00.390 --> 58:02.050
Of course you think that's awesome,

58:02.050 --> 58:04.100
because all you care about is getting laid.

58:04.270 --> 58:05.890
Even Peter was embarrassed by you.

58:06.060 --> 58:10.110
He just never said anything to your face because he was twice the man you are.

58:10.860 --> 58:12.400
You should get laid yourself.

58:12.570 --> 58:13.820
Except to have sex...

58:13.990 --> 58:16.320
...you gotta find somebody who can stand you first.

58:18.620 --> 58:20.910
Fuck you.

58:30.080 --> 58:32.140
You shouldn't ride a motorcycle.

58:32.140 --> 58:33.170
Your kid's parents died...

58:33.340 --> 58:35.300
She is not my kid.

58:38.090 --> 58:39.340
She's not my kid.

58:40.600 --> 58:42.220
Then whose kid is she?

01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:04.850
We'll do this again. One, two--

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:13.730
I'm sorry, Messer.

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.900
- l didn't mean it. - lt's all right.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:29.290
You know, I broke my back when I was 1 7. I was almost paralyzed.

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:34.000
And Pete spent that whole summer with me in my room...

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:36.630
...watching movies every day.

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:41.420
All my friends went out to the beach or went off to chase girls...

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.640
...but he just sat there with me the whole time.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.850
I can't leave him alone when he needs me.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.970
Even if he's gone.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.980
I dug up some of their old home movies because, you know, l was just....

01:00:56.150 --> 01:01:00.730
I just wanted to hear their voices, see them a minute, you know?

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.660
And l found this one, and you've gotta see this.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.800
Pretty great, huh?

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.020
I went with the lavender and then the blue sky,

01:01:13.020 --> 01:01:13.500
like we talked about.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.110
When did you paint this room?

01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:17.040
I did it when you were at the hospital.

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:19.340
You were supposed to do it three days ago.

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.920
It smells like paint fumes in here.

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:22.480
It's been drying for 12 hours.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.090
It has not been drying long enough.

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.580
You're getting so critical.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.470
She can't sleep in the bedroom tonight.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.580
It's not even wet.

01:01:28.590 --> 01:01:30.600
I wouldn't bring a baby into a wet room.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:31.870
Of course it's not wet,

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:34.310
but you think it doesn't smell for days afterwards?

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.110
It doesn't. It's totally aired out.

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.940
You know how much work I put into this?

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:39.740
You didn't do any of this.

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:42.440
When have you painted a cloud in your life?

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:44.770
l oversaw the work that was being done.

01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:45.240
You oversaw it?

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.660
The one thing you said you would do, you oversaw?

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:49.320
I got creative. the guy came in,

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.910
and I said, "Let's do the clouds."

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.230
This is ridiculous. she can't sleep here.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:53.950
Of course she can.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.110
Move the crib.

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:56.370
This is her room. where else...

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:59.170
So you're saying it's okay that we're horrible parents...

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.340
...and wanna kill each other half the time.

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.730
Two-thirds, actually.

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:08.470
I think we have to just stop trying to fit ourselves into their lives.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:13.140
You know, I hate this place. It's like a mausoleum in here.

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:16.100
You know, there's pictures of them everywhere.

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.610
And l really hate that cowboy painting.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.380
He's really creepy, right?

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.980
Yeah. I want it out.

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.040
If we're gonna live here,

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.530
we have to stop tiptoeing around...

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:31.240
...like they're coming back soon. They're not coming back.

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:05.530
This side has to... no.

01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:07.110
- That good right there? - No.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.490
- Looks good right there. - Okay, like that.

01:03:36.890 --> 01:03:37.970
Morning, Messer.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.390
Morning...

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.560
Jill.

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:51.230
Oh, and thank you for dinner.

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.950
- And next time it's my treat. - Oh, God.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.160
Right foot, left foot. Right foot, left foot.

01:03:59.330 --> 01:04:01.410
- Let's see some walking. - Would you stop that?

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:04.080
She'll walk when she's got somewhere to go, all right?

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:07.090
All the books say she should be walking or talking by now...

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.670
...and she's not doing either.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.930
All the books also say that you should be married with 2.2 kids...

01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:13.260
...and look at your life.

01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:16.390
That poor girl thinks that she's going to dinner with you.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.140
What's the alternative? "Bye, l'll never see you again"?

01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:21.730
- That would be mean. - Where do you meet these women?

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:24.520
I mean, if you're not with me and Sophie, you're at work.

01:04:24.690 --> 01:04:27.570
- l have my methods. - Huh. interesting.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:41.040
Switch it up. there we go. Oh, there it is.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:44.540
Okay. Oh, like a rubber band.

01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:50.090
- Limbering up? - How you doing, good-looking?

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:52.010
Oh, right back at you.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.220
- Hey, big man. - Hey, Ted.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.970
- Hey, you see that game last night? - Which game?

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:01.810
Oh, my God.

01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.350
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:05.690
l didn't know you were a runner.

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:08.480
We should train together. Yeah.

01:05:08.650 --> 01:05:10.610
Well, l like to use this time to think.

01:05:10.610 --> 01:05:12.320
Oh, yeah, me too. I like to think.

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:16.030
Is this the pace we're gonna keep up? It's a little brisk.

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:19.080
l still don't understand all these extra costs.

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.660
The job's been more complicated than we anticipated.

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:23.960
Oh, more complicated than anticipated, yeah.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.790
My life has been more complicated than anticipated.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.170
I didn't anticipate somebody handing me a baby...

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.710
- Ms. Berenson? - Yes?

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:33.490
Ah. Sorry. Hello, lady. What you doing?

01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:35.430
Can you just give me one minute?

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:38.050
Hey, Lonnie? Keep a better eye on her.

01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:39.600
She's crawling around back there.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.060
- lt's a construction site. - A baby that crawls?

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:44.140
- Just take her. - l can't. doing something.

01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:46.310
- Please. - Can't. Big basket.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.980
Can you help me out? -

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.480
You look beautiful with the baby, though.

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:51.030
Doesn't she look good with...?

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.070
That's a beautiful baby. like an accessory.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.280
Smooth.

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:57.110
Go, Wonder Pets. Yay!

01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:00.410
Wow, that was a really good episode.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.540
What I like about Ming-Ming is that even though they lost the game...

01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:09.330
...she really learned something valuable about teamwork, you know?

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.670
I didn't see that one coming. How about...?

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:14.710
Holly. stay right... You stay right...

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.740
Holly, Holly, Holly! She's standing!

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.550
She's about to walk! Get down here!

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.010
- What? Now? - Hurry up!

01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.180
She can't walk now! she can't walk now!

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:24.720
She's about to. get down here.

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:26.270
Okay, wait. stay right there.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.980
- Wait, l'm coming. - Hurry up!

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:29.430
She's walking! hurry up!

01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:30.400
Stall her. I'm coming.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.510
l'm coming! Just stall her. sttall her!

01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:34.650
l can't... How do you want me to stall her?

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:37.110
- How do l stall her? - Just stall her!

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.450
Don't you take that step. Please, don't take...

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.890
What do you want me to...?

01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:42.870
Ow! Oh, God, oh, God, I'm coming.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.890
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, l'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:46.790
Okay. What did you do?

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:50.330
You told me to stall her, so l just-- I gave her a little shove.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.710
I asked you to stall her, Messer, not traumatize her.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.050
- Now she'll never walk. - Okay, this is not my fault.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:59.520
What did the bad man do, huh?

01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.680
Pretty sure it was your fault.

01:07:24.830 --> 01:07:28.040
Hold on. Okay, go ahead.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.960
- Are those homemade noodles? - Yes.

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:39.420
She's the only person who doesn't like my cooking.

01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:41.090
Now it's personal.

01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:42.590
Come on.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.220
One bite.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:51.520
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I did it! She ate it!

01:07:51.690 --> 01:07:55.230
She ate my cooking, she ate my cooking, she ate my cooking!

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.440
I'm that good.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:23.930
- Oh, my God. - What?

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.850
This is why you are always so happy to run to the store.

01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:30.850
This is where you pick up women. You use Sophie to get laid.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:33.140
She's gotta pay back somehow. Isn't that right?

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:35.920
No free lunch, right, Soph?

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:36.609
I wanna see it.

01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:39.149
- See what? - I wanna see you work your Messer magic.

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:41.029
You want me to pick you up? Here?

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.529
Yes. I want you to loop around and pretend l'm one of those gym girls.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.660
I'm not gonna pretend to pick you up.

01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:49.830
- l wanna get home. - Uch. You're such a killjoy.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.660
You know what? I read about these.

01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:56.880
They're really good for kids, but l can't...

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.090
- How do you pronounce it? "Acyi?? -"Acyi?"

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.550
"Acyi?"

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.760
You must really have an ear for languages, huh?

01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:05.970
No, not really.

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.220
I took Spanish all through high school.

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:10.100
I did pretty well. got good grades.

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:15.350
Oh, you're good. you're very good.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:17.560
- You see that? - l see how this works for you.

01:09:17.729 --> 01:09:19.319
Holly?

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:22.529
Oh! It's Sam. It's Sophie's doctor, Sam.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.109
- Sam? you call him Sam? - Hey, Sophie.

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:26.740
- Dr. Nelson. - Hi. Sam.

01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:28.569
Hey, l'm Messer. nice to meet you.

01:09:28.569 --> 01:09:29.990
Messer, nice to meet you too.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.740
- ls this your...? - No, no, no.

01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:35.290
- No. - We're not.... We just....

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:36.960
Sounds complicated.

01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:38.790
- We raise Sophie together. - Yes.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:42.300
You know, Holly's mentioned how much she really likes Sophie's doctor...

01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:43.800
...A few times, actually.

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:46.590
So l thought she meant you were good with kids, but now...

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:49.300
Can you just walk away? can you just give me a minute?

01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:53.220
- l'm all right here. - Give me a minute. Thank you.

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:56.520
Sometimes Sophie is more of a grown-up.

01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:59.520
So how's this work between you two?

01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:01.810
You split up most of the work?

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:03.740
Yes. We have charts. a very big chart.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.030
- Chart? - Yeah.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.910
That chart give you any time off?

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.660
Yes, Monday, Wednesday and every other Friday.

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:11.080
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.000
- Will you have Sophie this Friday? - No.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.830
- Eight o'clock Friday? - Great.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.120
- My office has your information? -They sure do.

01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:20.040
- l'll call you up. - Perfect. Okay.

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:25.130
You are so right, this is such a great place to meet people.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.300
What time does Dr. Love get here?

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:30.970
Any minute. stop calling him that.

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.670
I can't believe he asked you out.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.720
Doesn't that defy some doctor-patient thing?

01:10:34.890 --> 01:10:36.010
He's a pediatrician, so if

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:37.890
he's dating a patient, there'd be a problem.

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.610
If you have sex, is he gonna tell you what percentile you're at?

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:46.320
- Hi. - Hey. Wow, you look....

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:49.970
Oh, l'd better not say anything.

01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:52.030
Best to keep a couple of cards off the table.

01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:54.790
-Hey, Messer. -Hey. How you doing, doc?

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:57.290
-Thanks for giving her the night off. -All right.

01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:59.750
You know, she tried on everything in her closet.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.120
Pretty much impossible to blow this one.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.670
Okay, Messer. We'll just go.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:06.340
-She hasn't had any for a while... -Oh, my God, stop it.

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:08.220
Call me if you need me.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.350
You know, if you wanted to kill me there were

01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:16.640
dumpsters on my side of town that were a lot closer.

01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:18.690
You don't like to be surprised, do you?

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:22.190
Well, l'm a little bit of a control freak, so....

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.980
- There we are. - Okay. Backstage at a concert.

01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:28.280
- l'm just not that cool. - No?

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:31.820
We're not going to Aerosmith or Justin Bieber?

01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:33.870
This is...

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.620
Le Mare.

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:41.210
The owner and executive chef has three girls, so....

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.790
- You treat Phillipe Le Mare's kids? - l do.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.550
- Oh, my God.  - Dr. Nelson.

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:47.920
- Phillipe. - Sam, hey. Phillipe Le Mare.

01:11:48.090 --> 01:11:50.050
- Such a pleasure. - No, no, pleasure's mine.

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.720
Special setup right here. Come on.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.260
So how are the beautiful girls?

01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:55.640
They're very healthy. They have a good doctor.

01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:59.730
You know, I don't do a lot of dinner dates, really.

01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:00.980
What about you?

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:04.020
No? You know what?

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:05.280
Why don't we just relax

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.360
and get to know each other? What do you say?

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:11.700
So you live around here?

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:13.110
Upstairs?

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:15.620
I just live right around the corner in the TV room.

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:18.580
You know, I knew l'd seen you somewhere around here.

01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:22.540
Excellent choice in the crushed watermelon, by the way.

01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:24.920
I'm sorry if l'm a little nervous.

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:27.500
It's just that l don't usually meet babies like you.

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:29.590
To be honest, l...

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.260
Well, l like older women.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.600
Well, not that much older.

01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:44.940
You are getting warmer, kiddo.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.460
l can't believe you've never come here.

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:51.940
l never used to eat out much.

01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:55.950
My ex-wife, she would cook, so we stayed home a lot.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.330
- You were married? - You like how l snuck that in there?

01:12:58.490 --> 01:13:00.080
Mm. Clever.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.960
-l'm so sorry. I thought l turned it off. -That's okay.

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:07.790
Messer, l get one night off.

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.630
Look, l'm not calling for you, I'm calling for Dr. Love.

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.880
Okay. All right, hold on.

01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:16.550
I'm sorry, he wants to talk to you. It must be a Sophie question.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:18.140
Hey.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:20.520
It could be a couple things.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.890
Take her down to the ER at St.Augustus.

01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:25.690
It's Friday, so Dr. Mooney's on call.

01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:28.480
I'll tell him you're on your way. You won't have to wait.

01:13:28.650 --> 01:13:30.690
We'll see you there in about an hour.

01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:32.570
Okay. Sophie's temperature spiked.

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:34.990
They're gonna need an hour, so l was hoping...

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.780
We gotta go.

01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:40.030
Or we could go.

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.830
Great. Thank you.

01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:52.650
So Sophie's got a urinary-tract infection.

01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:54.630
We're gonna put her on an antibiotic drip.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.300
That gets the medication into her system a bit faster.

01:13:57.470 --> 01:14:00.680
I'll stop back by first thing in the morning and check up on her.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.390
- Thanks. - Thank you so much.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:08.100
Yeah, l was kind of looking forward to dropping you home.

01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:12.020
I had rehearsed this whole thing in my mind.

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.910
That was even better than l rehearsed it.

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.290
- l'll call you later. - Okay.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:29.290
Thank you again.

01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:36.550
Hey, her temp's coming down.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.800
Clothes, daycare, monthly food bill...

01:14:38.970 --> 01:14:41.550
and now a $1 200 bill from the emergency room.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.260
If something happens to the car,

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:44.850
one of us is gonna sell a kidney.

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:47.230
Having a kid is expensive. We talked about that.

01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:50.610
Having kids and an expanding shop, it's a bit much.

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:52.900
Where'd you get the flowers?

01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:56.320
Oh. Sam sent them today. I haven't even called him back yet.

01:14:56.490 --> 01:14:58.130
I mean, how can I? I'm a disaster.

01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:00.070
I can't be this girl on the second date.

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.830
This is what you save for marriage. Like 10 years in.

01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:04.990
Don't stress about the money. We'll be fine.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.790
I'll just call Lonnie and we'll patch up the wall...

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.920
and maybe in a few years, we can rebuild it or something.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:13.590
Wait, so you're gonna pull the plug on the remodel?

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:16.550
I can't increase the construction loan. It's okay, you know?

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.760
I'll just have a shop and not a restaurant. It's fine.

01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:21.760
It'll be okay.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.640
You know, I can give you the money.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.610
-l have savings. -No. No, I can't let you do that.

01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:35.820
-l would never take your savings. -l want to.

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:38.650
We're raising a kid together. We have this house together.

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:40.150
This is just part of it.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.660
Look, having somebody help you doesn't mean that you failed.

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:46.540
It just means that you're not in it alone.

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:51.540
Okay, but it can't be a gift.

01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:53.540
I won't take it unless it's an investment.

01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:55.710
Fine. I'm an investor in Fraiche.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:56.960
You're...

01:15:57.130 --> 01:15:58.920
You're an investor in "Fraiche."

01:15:59.090 --> 01:16:00.630
- "Fraiche." Sorry. - "Fraiche."

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.840
That entitles you to 2 percent of profits.

01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:04.180
- Three percent. - Two.

01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:06.930
And, hey, a discount on food and wine.

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.430
- Discount? - Ten percent.

01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.850
- Fifteen percent. - Ten percent.

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.440
It's a great discount.

01:16:14.150 --> 01:16:16.150
- Then you throw in dinner. - Oh, deal.

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.730
- All right. - Awesome. Okay.

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:20.860
Oh, my God. Thank you so much. That's huge.

01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:24.320
Okay, dinner, tonight, on me. You and me.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.710
Hello.

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:34.500
- You look so pretty. - Oh, thank you.

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:39.300
Oh, my God.

01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:41.550
- Hey. - Hey.

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:44.430
So here are all the numbers.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.130
My cell phone, his cell phone,

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:47.970
the restaurant and the pediatrician.

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.560
Yep.

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:51.310
You know you actually

01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:53.770
have to leave the house for me to do my job?

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:54.980
- Yeah. - Yes.

01:16:55.150 --> 01:16:57.270
- Okay. All right. - Okay. All right.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:00.440
- Okay, have fun.  - Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.390
This place is amazing, Holly.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.890
I can't believe l haven't been here before.

01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:29.600
Look at you. You're a kitchen ninja.

01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:33.390
- You don't follow any kind of a recipe? - No.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:37.560
This is the only place in life where l do not follow a plan.

01:17:40.650 --> 01:17:43.780
You got under five minutes. No.

01:17:44.490 --> 01:17:46.610
I was technically awake.

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:55.620
- Are you sure you wanna do this? - A bet's a bet. I can do this.

01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:58.420
- You don't have to. - You know what l'm not sure about?

01:17:58.590 --> 01:18:01.750
The helmet.It's lame. I want something with thunderbolts on it.

01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.510
We're gonna pull out the choke.

01:18:03.670 --> 01:18:04.720
-The what? - The choke.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.930
- Okay. - All right?

01:18:06.090 --> 01:18:08.100
Turn on the ignition, pull in the clutch.

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.720
Here. Hold that in. Hold that in.

01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:12.220
- Okay. - Push the starter button.

01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:13.430
All right, there we go.

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.520
All right, left hand is the clutch, right hand is the throttle.

01:18:16.690 --> 01:18:19.060
- Okay. - All right, let's get your kickstand up.

01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:20.770
Oh, l'm on a freaking motorcycle!

01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:24.110
Easy there, Rain Man. We're not done? Now we're in first gear.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.360
- Okay. - Hold that.

01:18:25.530 --> 01:18:28.360
- Don't let go of that clutch till I get on... - Let go?

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:31.450
- Oh, my God. - No.

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.870
Oh, my God. Oh, Messer. Oh, Messer, I'm so sorry.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.460
- No, it's okay. Are you all right? - Yeah, yeah.

01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:47.930
Oh, no.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.260
Oh, no. Are you mad?

01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:53.680
No, I'm just... I'm gonna sit down.

01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:56.270
I thought you said, "Let go."

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:00.650
Do you want me to go talk to the bus driver maybe?

01:19:06.490 --> 01:19:08.820
- God, l am so sorry, Messer. - Don't worry about it.

01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:11.530
- l'm gonna pay for it, I promise. - l'm actually in awe.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:14.490
You didn't even drive it a foot before you destroyed it.

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.830
- l feel so bad. I'm really sorry. - lt's fine. Okay?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.790
It's just a bike.

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.170
Do you mean that, or are you just saying that...

01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:26.010
because you think if l keep talking, you're gonna cry?

01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:27.840
Get inside.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.340
- Hi.  - Hi.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.970
I didn't wanna move her.

01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:37.930
That's okay.

01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:42.100
Amy, wait a second.

01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:45.190
Here you go. Now, come on, no backsies.

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.610
-Thanks, Amy. -Thank you. Bye-bye. Have a good night.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.240
I think you guys make a really cute couple.

01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:01.420
She said the same thing about Taylor Swift and that Twilight kid.

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:55.970
Oh, my God, we're in their room.

01:20:56.890 --> 01:20:57.930
It's not so scary.

01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:59.770
- This room is beautiful. - Yeah.

01:20:59.930 --> 01:21:02.230
- How come we haven't used it at all? - l have no idea.

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:04.020
What thread count are these sheets? Ooh!

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:08.480
You think they planned this?

01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:10.320
What?

01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:13.650
Us? No. No.

01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:17.280
They tried that once before. We know how that worked out.

01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:21.200
Well, l kind of get it now.

01:21:21.370 --> 01:21:23.540
What, why they set us up?

01:21:23.710 --> 01:21:25.450
Yeah, l never understood it before,

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:27.080
but now that I know you better...

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:29.800
I can see what Alison was thinking.

01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:31.960
You have a lot in common with her.

01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:34.130
- With Alison? - Yeah.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.230
You'd think it would be Peter,

01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:38.470
but it's her you remind me more of.

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:46.650
She was just so fun and easygoing, you know?

01:21:53.150 --> 01:21:55.320
- l have a surprise. - What?

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:59.740
- Something I found earlier. - What?

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.710
- A little contraband. - Oh, my God, no.

01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:06.500
- What do you mean, no? - We can't.

01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:08.960
- Sophie is asleep in the next room. - She's asleep.

01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:10.750
Come on, it'll help us stave off glaucoma.

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:15.170
- No. - Come on.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:18.050
No. Absolutely not.

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:21.180
We cannot smoke that.

01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:31.440
Don't.

01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:45.200
- Why are you leaving them? - l'm just taking a few.

01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:46.960
We're not gonna eat all these.

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:50.170
All right. Come on, let's go. What are we watching?

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.210
Jump in the car

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:56.420
And buckle up

01:22:56.970 --> 01:22:59.550
You know there was five Wiggles originally?

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:00.890
I was the fifth Wiggle.

01:23:01.050 --> 01:23:02.180
Jump in the car

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.470
Put on my seat belt

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:07.230
And we can ride the whole day long

01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:10.600
- Oh! That's neat. How do you do that? - Like a wiggle.

01:23:10.770 --> 01:23:13.480
- Am I doing it? Am l doing it? - That's good.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.990
This is inappropriate for children.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.790
The shining moon sees no sunlight

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:30.250
The sun sees no moonbeams

01:23:30.670 --> 01:23:34.710
- So the moon and the sun are friends? - They're best friends.

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:38.420
They're in each other's dreams

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.280
What? Who?

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:03.320
- Hello? - That's the baby monitor.

01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:04.990
Oh, where's the phone?

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.330
- l think it's the door. - l'll get the door.

01:24:09.370 --> 01:24:10.730
Oh, good morning, Mr. Messer.

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.710
I hope this isn't too inconvenient a time.

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:16.460
No, no, no, this is perfect. Just give us one minute.

01:24:16.630 --> 01:24:19.050
Actually, it's rather warm outside. I'd love to...

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.840
- Hey, Janine is here. - What? Now?

01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:25.470
- God, that lady has the worst timing. - Come on.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.350
You take Sophie. I'll clean upstairs, you clean downstairs.

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.730
- And get the illicit drugs. - Okay.

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:59.340
Okay, okay, okay. We didn't smoke it.

01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:01.670
- l got a little carried away. - You ready? Okay.

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.340
- Where's Sophie? - Where's Sophie?

01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:04.510
So...?

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:10.640
There we go. All right, there we go.

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.060
Well, you seem more settled in your roles.

01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:14.940
Yeah, yeah. We have learned a lot.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:17.860
And so has Miss Sophie. She's walking now.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.110
So how are you two getting along? Is there any tension?

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.900
-Us? -Why would there be tension?

01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:26.200
-Everything's fantastic. -Everything's all good, good, good.

01:25:26.370 --> 01:25:29.030
Have you thought about how you're gonna make this work...

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.040
or what your plans might be together?

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.040
We hadn't really gotten that far. It's still pretty new.

01:25:34.210 --> 01:25:38.460
And some things just happened with no plan at all.

01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:41.340
Really? Because I kind of had a plan in mind.

01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:43.060
Really? It just never occurred

01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:45.340
to me that you had any interest in my plans.

01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:47.760
How could you not know I wanted to plan with you?

01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:50.060
Maybe I'm not as experienced a planner as you.

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:51.870
l think you're a good planner.

01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:53.680
Oh, come on, people, you had sex.

01:25:57.230 --> 01:25:58.900
We have no intention of letting

01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:01.650
our personal lives affect our parenting, l promise.

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:03.820
You gonna get married?

01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:05.740
This happened, what, six hours ago?

01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:08.070
That's a little specific. I don't know if she...

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.240
What if it doesn't work out? Are you gonna sleep in the garage?

01:26:11.410 --> 01:26:13.590
Sex in this situation, it's like termites.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.620
It makes for a very unstable household.

01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.190
You were supposed to be my easy case.

01:26:18.190 --> 01:26:19.920
I got a nice coffee on the way here.

01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:22.000
I thought, "Gonna deal with my easy case,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.010
gonna make it like a little vacation. Yay!"

01:26:24.170 --> 01:26:25.920
- Look, Janine, it...  - Now, oh, my God.

01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:27.700
We have one more meeting scheduled.

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:29.680
Before then, work out your personal issues.

01:26:29.850 --> 01:26:32.970
Whether you decide to get engaged or pretend it never happened...

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:34.430
I don't care.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.520
Just work your shit out, okay?

01:26:37.690 --> 01:26:39.060
- Okay, okay. - Okay, okay.

01:26:41.730 --> 01:26:45.490
- Do you mind if l snag a brownie? - Oh, God, no. No, no, no.

01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:48.160
Oh, really, l'm so sorry.

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.660
It's a bad batch, and l'm a professional baker.

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:52.590
No, it's okay. Your house, your food.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.410
Anyway, so l'm sorry. I'm out of here.

01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:55.790
- Thank you.  - l'm sorry.

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.750
- Are you...?  - lt's okay. Thank you.

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.130
You're my last single friend.

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:06.300
Without you, I have no link to the outside.

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:10.340
Look, l don't know why we did it. We just...  We just did.

01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:14.510
Do you know what marriage is like? Imagine a prison.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:17.100
- And then don't change anything. - We're not married.

01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:19.230
You guys are raising a kid together.

01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:21.190
That's the most married you can get.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.860
Messer.

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:25.230
- Minute? - Oh, yeah.

01:27:27.570 --> 01:27:30.320
So l gave you a nice big fat break.

01:27:30.490 --> 01:27:32.240
That didn't go so well.

01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:34.010
Should I learn my lesson with you,

01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:35.620
or should l give you another shot?

01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:38.910
Given a choice, I'd go with that one, the shot.

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.210
You get it better than just about anybody here.

01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:43.710
Sports isn't just about stats and memorizing plays.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:46.000
It's about insight, it's about feeling.

01:27:46.170 --> 01:27:48.590
You got the talent, but you are all over the place.

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:50.050
I can be in one place, Alan.

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.720
- Can you? - Yeah.

01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:53.100
Can you be in Phoenix?

01:27:54.010 --> 01:27:55.850
A spot opened up directing for the Suns.

01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:58.680
They called, asked who l thought was right for the job.

01:27:58.850 --> 01:28:00.440
I'd like to tell them you.

01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.610
Let me know.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.280
Every time l think of you

01:28:17.450 --> 01:28:20.040
I always catch my breath

01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:25.790
And l'm still standing here and you're miles away

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:28.210
Somebody's getting along pretty good.

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:30.880
Mmm. Two cats in heat.

01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:33.340
Ooh. Look at her. Frisky kitty.

01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:36.970
That's too casual. I'll tell you this, they totally did it.

01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:39.310
I don't think so. I honestly don't think so.

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.480
She bet me $400 that they were gonna sleep together by Labor Day.

01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:44.090
That's why you're saying that.

01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:46.150
l feel like l'm watching CSI: Relationship.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.470
If me at any age of my life could see me,

01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:50.570
he would kick my cat ass, you know that?

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:54.160
Uh-oh. Messer owes you a quarter, he does. He said a bad word.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.410
Messer. I heard you lived around here.

01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:58.790
Ben, hey.

01:28:58.950 --> 01:29:00.260
Sweet move, landing Phoenix.

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.040
We're gonna miss you around the arena.

01:29:02.210 --> 01:29:03.810
We're still talking about that.

01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:05.710
Alan said it seemed like a done deal.

01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:07.690
We're probably gonna be over at the band in a bit.

01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:08.420
Meet you there.

01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:09.920
Nice whiskers though.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.010
What was that about?

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.100
Nothing. Come on, let's go, let's go.

01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:20.550
Thank you.

01:29:20.890 --> 01:29:22.230
Come on, Messer, out with it.

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:25.060
It's just something Alan and I talked about the other day.

01:29:25.230 --> 01:29:28.150
He put me up for a directing job. It's....

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.730
- In Phoenix. - For the Suns.

01:29:29.900 --> 01:29:32.160
Running their whole crew for the season.

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.700
You said no, though, right?

01:29:33.860 --> 01:29:35.020
Well, I didn't wanna be rude

01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:37.280
and just turn it down right on the spot.

01:29:37.450 --> 01:29:38.990
So why didn't you tell me about it?

01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:42.310
Because I didn't-- I don't know, I didn't want it to be a thing.

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:43.620
It's not like I can take it anyway.

01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:46.120
- But you want to. - Well, of course I want to.

01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:49.340
- It's a huge opportunity. - So you're thinking about it.

01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:52.010
- No. - No?

01:29:52.170 --> 01:29:53.800
No, I'm not thinking about it.

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:57.720
I don't understand why you didn't just mention it to me.

01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:59.850
Because I didn't want you to get upset,

01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:01.310
which you obviously are.

01:30:01.470 --> 01:30:03.980
Why would I be upset if it's not even a possibility?

01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:04.910
Know what, Mess?

01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:07.400
Can you just stop with the food for one minute?

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.050
Can you just tell me honestly,

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:10.980
are you thinking about taking this job?

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.820
Yeah. I'm thinking about it.

01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:18.320
This is something that I've been working for, okay?

01:30:18.490 --> 01:30:21.330
I would've jumped at this opportunity before.

01:30:21.490 --> 01:30:22.790
Before Sophie and before me?

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:26.670
I get it. Come on. Come here, bugaboo.

01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:29.000
- Holly. Holl-- - Hey, bugaboos. Hello, bugaboos.

01:30:29.170 --> 01:30:30.630
How was this gonna work exactly?

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.130
Were we gonna go with you, or were you gonna leave?

01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.670
I don't know. I never had to think for three people.

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:38.550
I barely had to think for one. It's just a job offer, okay?

01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.980
No, it's not, it's exactly

01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:42.010
what you've been waiting for, a clean out.

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:44.600
- That's not true. - You have never wanted to be here.

01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:47.730
And after everything, you still think of us as temporary.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.350
You think that I'm not in this?

01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.660
I gave up my place, I gave up my motorcycle,

01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:52.730
I gave you money for your restaurant.

01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:55.690
- I never asked you for money. - I did it to make you happy.

01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:58.280
I gave up everything to play this frigging part.

01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:01.070
"Play this part"?

01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:02.910
That's what this is to you.

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.080
Well, we're living in their house,

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:05.790
we're sleeping in their bed, we're raising their kid.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.500
We're acting like we're married, but we're not.

01:31:08.670 --> 01:31:10.400
Have you been pretending with Sophie?

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:12.250
No, I love Sophie.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.540
So just me, then.

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:19.050
You should take the job, Messer.

01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:31.560
I know. I'm sorry.

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:37.940
I'm sorry.

01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:24.490
I'm coming, Soph. I'm coming, honey, hold on.

01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:32.000
I knew you'd be up to your eyeballs in egg whites,

01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:33.010
so I just grabbed her.

01:32:33.330 --> 01:32:34.380
- Thanks. - There you go.

01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:39.130
Good morning, Miss Soph. I missed you.

01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:42.130
You slept so good last night. Can you say "Apple"?

01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:43.470
Apple.

01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:45.010
Banana.

01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:47.850
Why do I always sound like Antonio Banderas when l do that.

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.600
Banana.

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:53.640
I'd love to sit and eat,

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:55.690
but I got the Finister twins coming in this morning...

01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:57.770
...and if I'm even a minute late,

01:32:57.770 --> 01:33:00.320
they will redecorate my waiting room, again.

01:33:01.150 --> 01:33:03.200
I'll see you later?

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:05.410
Wait, take a muffin.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.990
Thanks. Bye, Sophie.

01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:10.200
- Bye. - Bye.

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:25.890
And the Phoenix Suns' Steve Nash to a....

01:33:26.050 --> 01:33:29.350
Greg, ready that cutaway. Roll it.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.520
Take it.

01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:40.070
...Weirdo, what the hell am I doing here?

01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:16.770
- Thanks. - Oh, look.

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:23.030
Oh, look at you. My goodness, you're getting so big.

01:34:24.190 --> 01:34:26.440
- She's huge, right? - That iChat doesn't do her justice.

01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:29.450
- "Messer." Can you say "Messer"? - Oh, good luck with that.

01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.490
- Still no "Holly," Huh? - Nope.

01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:33.110
You know what it's like to

01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:35.620
be outranked by "Cup," "Pool," And "Giraffe"?

01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:39.420
Okay, so we are all set for Monday.

01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:42.170
Janine actually broke tradition and scheduled something.

01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:46.090
So you really did kill the expansion, huh? That's too bad.

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:49.970
Yeah, we were like this before and we were fine, so....

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.720
All right, you ready?

01:34:53.680 --> 01:34:54.720
See you.

01:34:54.890 --> 01:34:56.600
- Have fun. - Okay.

01:34:58.400 --> 01:35:00.400
- Hey, Mess? - Yeah?

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.820
I don't know if you have any plans or not...

01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:05.780
...but, well, Sam and I are hosting a Thanksgiving dinner...

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.820
...and the neighbors are gonna be there.

01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:09.300
They keep asking about you,

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:11.280
so I don't know, maybe you wanna join us.

01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:12.530
- Yeah. - Yeah?

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:13.990
- Yeah, what the hell. - Okay.

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.620
- All right. You're cooking? - Yes.

01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:17.790
- All right. I'll see you there. - Great.

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:19.250
Say goodbye. There we go.

01:35:28.130 --> 01:35:29.800
You think?

01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:32.300
You don't think it needs more nutmeg?

01:35:34.810 --> 01:35:35.890
You are no help.

01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:38.480
I'll get it.

01:35:42.650 --> 01:35:44.730
Whoa, settle down.

01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:46.690
- Hey. - Hi.

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:48.990
- Happy Thanksgiving. - Yeah, you too.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.740
- I got you a little wine. - Thanks.

01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:52.490
Nine bucks.

01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:56.410
- Where's Soph? - She's back there.

01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:58.460
- Okay. - Come on in.

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.830
Hey, sweetie.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.790
- That was a wave to me. - Okay.

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.500
So, what else you maniacs been up to?

01:36:06.630 --> 01:36:07.300
I'm gonna tell you

01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:09.170
Gary and I are taking a couples' karate class.

01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:10.800
Fun.

01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:11.500
I just figure out

01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.340
I'm not gonna be around to defend him all the time.

01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:15.010
- Toughen him up. - Yeah.

01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:16.890
What a great opportunity to get

01:36:16.890 --> 01:36:19.640
to kick your spouse in the face once in a while...

01:36:19.810 --> 01:36:23.270
...in a controlled setting where it's okay and it's expected.

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:24.980
Messer.

01:36:25.150 --> 01:36:28.440
- Hey. How you doing, doc? - Good, good.

01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:31.030
- Glad you could make it. - Appreciate that.

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.720
Although, technically, this is my house,

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:35.620
so I'm glad you could make it.

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:39.040
You know, I know this is a little weird.

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:42.330
- No, it's not weird. - It's a little weird.

01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:44.920
The house, we're all a part of it, especially you.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.920
Yeah, we're all fans of the house.

01:36:48.090 --> 01:36:50.410
Hey, dinner today is a great way for us

01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:51.300
to say goodbye, right?

01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:52.680
Absolutely.

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:57.310
I'm sorry, am I missing something?

01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:02.600
You're selling the house?

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:05.280
When were you gonna tell me about this?

01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:06.640
After our meeting with CPS.

01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:08.230
It's just too big, Messer.

01:37:08.230 --> 01:37:09.780
The upkeep's a fortune. You know that.

01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:12.020
- I'm paying my half. - I appreciate that,

01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:13.360
but it's still not enough.

01:37:13.530 --> 01:37:14.910
You should've asked me, Holly.

01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:17.530
Oh, like you asked me about moving to Phoenix?

01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:18.660
You're not selling the house.

01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:20.580
They wanted her to grow up here.

01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:22.590
What they wanted was you and I to raise her together,

01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:24.750
but you walked away from that obligation.

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.480
You sure didn't waste any time finding somebody else

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.380
hold diaper bag, did you?

01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:29.300
Oh, really? Are you gonna try to make me feel bad

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:30.670
because you walked away?

01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.340
I do get you wanted to do it all on your own,

01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:33.930
but you never could've done it without me.

01:37:34.090 --> 01:37:35.780
That's why ten seconds after I was gone,

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:37.140
you found you self a Replacement Messer.

01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:38.720
He is not Replacement Messer.

01:37:38.890 --> 01:37:41.770
Sound really travels in here, don't you think?

01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:44.340
You know what? He is nothing like you.

01:37:44.340 --> 01:37:46.520
Sam is nothing like you.

01:37:46.690 --> 01:37:49.080
He is warm and kind, and he

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.980
doesn't run away at the first sign of something real.

01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:53.250
Yeah, I ran. My best friend died,

01:37:53.250 --> 01:37:55.070
and overnight I had a house and a baby.

01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:57.070
- I'm sorry if-- - If what?

01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:59.280
- I was scared. - You don't think I was scared?

01:37:59.450 --> 01:38:01.340
It was easier for you. You wanted this.

01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:03.000
You wanted the life that they had.

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:06.170
But not the way I got it. Jesus, not the way I got it.

01:38:06.330 --> 01:38:08.630
And surely not with somebody who didn't love me back.

01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:10.460
But I did.

01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:14.340
Holly, I still do.

01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:21.390
No, you're right.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:22.930
We were just....

01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:26.270
We were just pretending to be them.

01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.610
We needed each other to get through everything.

01:38:29.770 --> 01:38:31.490
And now that's done, and we

01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:34.280
don't need to pretend anymore, Messer, okay?

01:38:34.450 --> 01:38:36.530
I don't wanna fight with you, please.

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:44.700
I'm gonna go back to Phoenix.

01:38:45.370 --> 01:38:47.290
You can handle Janine on your own.

01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:50.500
Looks like you got things covered here without me.

01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:58.090
Oh, damn it.

01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:04.680
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:06.430
It was great to see you all.

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.810
If you're ever in Phoenix, don't be afraid to look me up.

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:37.340
Okay, dinner is served.

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.550
You guys all should try the stuffing. Really, it's amazing.

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:43.100
There's an andouille-sausage thing going on,

01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:44.350
so you'll love it.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.600
Go ahead and dig in. Come on, everybody, just....

01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:50.190
Eat, now.

01:39:59.150 --> 01:40:02.410
- All right, thanks for coming. - Good night, sweetie.

01:40:10.580 --> 01:40:12.080
Yeah, okay, that was bad.

01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:17.960
Yeah, maybe we did go too fast.

01:40:18.130 --> 01:40:20.090
You're clearly have unresolved feelings for him, Holly.

01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:23.010
Messer and I barely got along under the best circumstances...

01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:25.720
...and there weren't very many of those either.

01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:29.020
If my wife and I fought like that...

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:33.150
...well, we'd still be married.

01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:43.110
You know, before anything happened to Peter and Alison...

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:46.660
...you were exactly the guy I wanted to be with.

01:40:47.410 --> 01:40:49.390
I would lose time thinking about you,

01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:51.370
and I didn't even know your name yet.

01:40:58.300 --> 01:40:59.340
I'll miss you guys.

01:41:09.850 --> 01:41:13.980
"Leonardo was a terrible monster.

01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:18.270
He couldn't scare anyone.

01:41:20.650 --> 01:41:23.030
He didn't have 1642--"

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.990
Mama.

01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:28.790
No, Holly.

01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:32.040
- No, I'm Holly. - Mama.

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:53.390
Yeah, baby girl. I'm your mama.

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:07.120
The truth is, you know, sometimes it works better...

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:09.580
...with one person doing everything, you know?

01:42:09.740 --> 01:42:12.450
No charts, no arguments.

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:15.540
I know it's not ideal.

01:42:15.710 --> 01:42:18.710
But since when do parents get the ideal, right?

01:42:20.170 --> 01:42:24.920
Right? Right, pretty girl? Huh? I know, I know.

01:42:30.510 --> 01:42:32.390
I'm sorry.

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:34.810
I can't do this. This isn't right.

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:37.650
- Is there a problem? - Yeah, I'm an idiot.

01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:40.570
I gotta reschedule. I'm sorry. I need to get to the airport.

01:42:40.730 --> 01:42:42.570
- Come on. - What?

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:03.170
All right, come on. Pick up, pick up, pick up.

01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:05.170
Hey, this is Messer.

01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:07.260
Leave me something dirty.

01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:11.260
You know, I could have come back for you.

01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.260
Well, this is our last meeting,

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:15.060
and I'm booked up for the next month.

01:43:15.230 --> 01:43:18.440
- One way or another, we're finishing it. - Okay.

01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:20.380
If you wanna get there quickly,

01:43:20.380 --> 01:43:22.480
you might wanna drive faster than other cars.

01:43:22.650 --> 01:43:24.360
But you're observing me, so....

01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:27.990
- I'm observing you miss the flight. Move it. - Okay.

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.180
Come here.

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:59.520
July 22nd, 2010. First steps.

01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:04.070
Where you going? Come back.

01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:14.780
You have a beautiful family.

01:44:16.660 --> 01:44:17.750
Thank you.

01:44:18.710 --> 01:44:20.290
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:22.880
...Flight 722 to Phoenix will now begin boarding.

01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:32.840
Hi. Hi. I need two tickets

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:35.100
that will get me anywhere near Terminal T...

01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:37.330
...as fast as possible, please.

01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:39.600
Three. I'm not waiting in the car.

01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:43.150
The baby's shoes too, ma'am.

01:44:44.190 --> 01:44:46.520
Are you kidding me? They're baby shoes.

01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:48.590
Just give her to me. Give her to me. Go.

01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:50.610
Here. Okay, thanks.

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:48.250
It's just, you ran all the way there...

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:50.450
...and I thought when I took Sophie,

01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:51.960
it would be, you know, okay.

01:45:52.130 --> 01:45:54.930
I know. You know, you did great, you did.

01:45:55.090 --> 01:45:57.550
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine, I will.

01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:00.060
- I've got Sophie. - Yeah.

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:02.980
And maybe this is the way things were meant to be, so--

01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:05.520
You're just gonna be so unhappy.

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.070
I'm not gonna start crying again.

01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:09.440
I should get Sophie inside.

01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:12.030
Yeah, sure.

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:19.280
- You're gonna be a great mom. - Thanks.

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:23.950
- I'll let CPS know you passed. - Thank you. Thanks.

01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:26.620
- Chin up. - Okay.

01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:28.250
I'm really sorry that I cried.

01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:30.750
- No problem. Used to crying. - Okay.

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.060
Wanna play with the keys?

01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:47.600
Just don't lose them like last time.

01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:58.620
Oh, my God. Messer. Oh, my God.

01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:01.120
I didn't mean to scare you, all right?

01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:04.290
I had my key, and I thought that you'd be home for Janine.

01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:06.370
Messer--

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:09.130
Look, please don't say anything. Just listen.

01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:12.840
I finally figured out why Peter and Alison picked us.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.840
And it's not because we knew them best.

01:47:15.010 --> 01:47:17.550
It's because you and me together, with Sophie...

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:20.590
...somehow, we're a family.

01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:24.680
Like they were. And that's why they picked us.

01:47:24.850 --> 01:47:27.940
And when I'm gone, I don't just miss her or you, I miss us.

01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:29.980
I miss our family.

01:47:30.150 --> 01:47:31.400
I know we got it all backwards.

01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:33.370
You're supposed to meet, fall in love,

01:47:33.370 --> 01:47:35.030
then have a baby, but I don't care.

01:47:35.190 --> 01:47:38.070
I don't care how it happened, because I fell in love with you.

01:47:38.530 --> 01:47:40.360
- I fell in love with our family. - Messer.

01:47:43.370 --> 01:47:45.290
I was at the airport.

01:47:48.370 --> 01:47:51.630
Did you plan some kind of a trip that I'm not aware of?

01:47:52.210 --> 01:47:53.590
No.

01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:58.670
Well, did you hear me say I loved you?

01:47:58.670 --> 01:48:00.300
Because I can say it again.

01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:02.050
Okay.

01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:05.560
I love you.

01:48:27.410 --> 01:48:29.680
When I found out that I was pregnant again,

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:31.620
I just cried and I cried and I cried.

01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:32.810
And I said, "Scott,

01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.210
can we be this blessed? Can we?"

01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:36.500
We can't repeat what I said. It was not polite.

01:48:36.670 --> 01:48:38.520
We cannot. We were--

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.420
You know what? I think Campbell needs a new diaper.

01:48:40.590 --> 01:48:41.840
- Okay. - Thank you.

01:48:42.010 --> 01:48:43.050
- Me, huh? - Yeah.

01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:45.390
- All right. - Look at him go.

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:46.830
Oh, Scott, could you get me

01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:49.060
maybe a little glass of ice water or something?

01:48:49.230 --> 01:48:50.860
Of course. Why haven't I done that already?

01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:52.060
Oh, I don't know.

01:48:52.230 --> 01:48:54.020
Coming through.

01:48:54.190 --> 01:48:56.730
- Hey. Cookie? - Uh-oh. I don't know what's more delicious.

01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:59.690
- Oh, no, thanks. Trying to cut back. - Okay.

01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:02.530
Give me that back. I'll take one of these. Mostly raisins.

01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:04.780
- It's like a salad. - Yeah. It's a great salad.

01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:06.590
It's all about the sleep schedule, man.

01:49:06.590 --> 01:49:08.700
You've gotta put those babies to sleep.

01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:11.460
Hey, Sophie has a request for the caterer.

01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:13.000
- Cake. - Yeah.

01:49:13.170 --> 01:49:14.580
Cake? Do you like cake?

01:49:16.210 --> 01:49:18.550
It's simple, it's understated, it's....

01:49:18.710 --> 01:49:21.710
Yeah, you know me. That's how I roll. Simple, understated.

01:49:25.010 --> 01:49:27.560
- Ah. Okay, okay. - Ah. Yes.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.580
You're never gonna get any easier, are you?

01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:31.640
Nope. And I have another one.

01:49:32.770 --> 01:49:35.690
- What? She's 2. - It's for us, because we made it a year.

01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.990
Okay, babe.

01:49:41.490 --> 01:49:42.490
- All right. - Ready?

01:49:42.650 --> 01:49:45.700
- Here we go, Soph. Alrighty. - Here we go.

01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:48.740
Here we go. We're going to the birthday party.

01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:52.000
Happy birthday to you

01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:55.750
Happy birthday to you

01:49:56.330 --> 01:50:00.340
Happy birthday, dear Sophie

01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:04.470
Happy birthday to you
