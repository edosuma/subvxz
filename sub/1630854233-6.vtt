00:01.566 --> 00:03.090
<i>Previously on
"Reginald the Vampire..."</i>

00:03.177 --> 00:04.700
<i>That woman is insane.</i>

00:04.787 --> 00:06.528
That woman is
a stone-cold killer.

00:06.615 --> 00:07.964
Surprise.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.010
Here's your target,
Reginald Andres.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.576
He's a vampire?

00:11.663 --> 00:14.318
Visualize, believe, achieve.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.146
- Why are you helping me?
- I want you to live.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.453
<i>- Hey, Reggie.</i>
- Hi, Maurice.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.063
I needed some time
to clear my head.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.065
- I'm sorry too.
- Is that what I think it is?

00:22.152 --> 00:23.806
Don't touch anything.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.112
What in the world are you
doing with herb of the cross?

00:25.199 --> 00:27.766
- Ooh!
<i>- Feeding on Todd stops now.</i>

00:27.853 --> 00:29.507
- What am I supposed to do?
- You hunt.

00:29.594 --> 00:32.467
- That's my jam.
- I know.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.773
<i>Next up,
we have Reginald and Sarah.</i>

00:53.792 --> 00:55.577
I turn my back
for one second--

00:55.664 --> 00:58.493
one second, and there he is
in the shit again.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.886
Huh?
How does it keep happening?

01:00.973 --> 01:03.628
And I'm the idiot who has to
clean it up every goddamn time.

01:03.715 --> 01:06.414
Look, I-I'm very sympathetic

01:06.501 --> 01:08.807
when you clean up
my mess and all,

01:08.894 --> 01:11.332
but I'm a little lost here.

01:11.419 --> 01:13.247
Reggie, do you have
any idea the level

01:13.334 --> 01:15.640
of cluster----
you just found yourself in?

01:15.727 --> 01:17.816
What, you mean
the weird vampire lady?

01:17.903 --> 01:19.905
No, no, I'm talking
about the timeless power

01:19.992 --> 01:21.559
of a Bonnie Tyler classic.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.474
Of course I'm talking
about the weird vampire lady.

01:23.561 --> 01:25.476
That's Nikki,
the vampire assassin--

01:25.563 --> 01:26.912
the world's deadliest.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.566
Okay, that woman,

01:28.653 --> 01:31.961
she takes care
of Angela's problems.

01:32.048 --> 01:35.225
Reginald, that problem is you.

01:35.312 --> 01:37.575
Wait, wait, wait.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.011
Did you not see her singing?

01:39.099 --> 01:40.317
She's a big softie.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.014
No, that woman
is chaos incarnate.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.147
She is a hurricane with feet.

01:44.234 --> 01:45.583
She'll enter your life

01:45.670 --> 01:48.108
and obliterate everything
and everyone in it.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.457
Sarah.

01:51.372 --> 01:52.677
Sarah!

01:52.764 --> 01:54.201
I know it sucks right now,

01:54.288 --> 01:57.073
but you're gonna get over
whatever this is.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.249
- Hey, we should go now.
- Your voice

01:59.336 --> 02:01.425
is the voice of an angel.

02:01.512 --> 02:02.948
Wait, are you talking
about Reginald?

02:03.035 --> 02:04.428
Let's just leave
the sad lady alone.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.038
But I think she's
talking about you.

02:06.126 --> 02:06.996
Well, that makes
no sense at all.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.302
None, but--

02:08.389 --> 02:10.130
Hey, it was really nice
to meet you

02:10.217 --> 02:13.481
and good luck with whatever
future endeavors you may have,

02:13.568 --> 02:15.439
but we got to go.
- But--okay.

02:15.526 --> 02:16.788
- Yeah. We should go.
- But should we--

02:16.875 --> 02:19.791
The voice of an angel
that made us.

02:43.424 --> 02:46.557
Haemolacria.

02:46.644 --> 02:48.559
It's a condition
where you cry blood

02:48.646 --> 02:50.692
like you do.

02:50.779 --> 02:53.564
- You.
- Yes.

02:53.651 --> 02:56.045
Me, Ashley.

03:02.007 --> 03:03.966
I was hoping
I'd run into you again.

03:04.053 --> 03:05.446
Obviously, this isn't
what I pictured,

03:05.533 --> 03:06.882
the running into--not--

03:06.969 --> 03:10.364
not that I pictured anything.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.975
It just looked like you could
maybe use a friend right now.

03:13.062 --> 03:15.978
Is there any way you could
stop this incessant pounding?

03:16.065 --> 03:17.980
I-I think that's your heart
and you want it to do that.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.982
But I-I can't--
I can't breathe.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.592
I feel like it's trying
to bust out of my chest.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.203
Mm, mm, mm.

03:23.290 --> 03:26.815
Textbook panic attack.

03:26.902 --> 03:29.992
I've seen a lot of panic.
This feels different.

03:30.079 --> 03:32.081
Denial will only
make it worse.

03:32.168 --> 03:36.564
What you want to do is
you want to put your head down

03:36.651 --> 03:40.829
between your knees like so,
and you just let it hang loose,

03:40.916 --> 03:44.311
and, uh, take some deep breaths
in through your nose...

03:44.398 --> 03:46.617
And out through your mouth.

03:46.704 --> 03:50.708
In and out.

03:50.795 --> 03:55.887
In and out.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.541
How does that fee--

04:07.595 --> 04:09.771
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's your hurry?

04:09.858 --> 04:12.034
Let's enjoy the night
while it lasts.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.905
You know, I feel like
the night would be

04:13.992 --> 04:16.168
much better enjoyed
inside where we can

04:16.256 --> 04:19.259
lock doors and hopefully
windows as well.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.740
Well, I feel
completely safe with you.

04:22.827 --> 04:25.265
Really?

04:27.745 --> 04:31.923
We emerged from a crazy
food fight unscathed

04:32.010 --> 04:34.752
and a karaoke superfan unmurdered.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.711
I'm not sure what it is
about our dates,

04:36.798 --> 04:39.366
but crazy sure seems
to follow us wherever we go.

04:39.453 --> 04:42.020
Oh, no, that's so true,
isn't it?

04:42.107 --> 04:46.155
Oh, but they're unforgettable
and ridiculous,

04:46.242 --> 04:48.679
and I wouldn't change a thing.

04:50.768 --> 04:53.031
There is one thing
I would change.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.753
I should've done that
so much sooner.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.626
Your timing feels
perfect to me.

05:22.713 --> 05:26.848
I promise you, our next date
is gonna be so, so normal.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.240
It'll be boring.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.591
Oh, well,
it would have to be boring

05:30.678 --> 05:32.375
in order for us
to course correct.

05:32.462 --> 05:35.857
Maybe we file taxes.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.120
We could sit at a bus stop
and not get on the bus.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.122
Ooh, how late
is the DMV open?

05:40.209 --> 05:41.993
Oh, clog dancing.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.213
Oh, yeah, that sounds awful.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.823
- Nice.
- Yeah.

05:47.695 --> 05:48.826
Maybe we could do, like,

05:48.913 --> 05:51.829
some Russian
language class or--

05:51.916 --> 05:54.310
Oh, we could do our taxes.

05:54.397 --> 05:55.833
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.357
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

05:57.444 --> 06:00.316
My grandma is making some pie--

06:12.415 --> 06:14.330
Can we raincheck this please?

06:14.417 --> 06:17.420
I need a palate cleanser
after that.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.379
You're welcome to join
if you'd like.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.165
I don't know
who's more delusional,

06:23.252 --> 06:25.428
the unhinged assassin

06:25.515 --> 06:27.561
or the woman who thinks
she can control her.

06:27.648 --> 06:31.478
Ooh, hypocrisy
is crisp tonight.

06:31.565 --> 06:32.522
Yeah, I wonder what
the Council will think

06:32.609 --> 06:34.263
of your illegal maneuver,

06:34.350 --> 06:38.006
which, from the looks of it,
failed miserably.

06:38.093 --> 06:41.923
And now,
Nikki's loose in Akron.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.446
Did Reginald really
deserve that?

06:43.533 --> 06:45.709
Hate to break it to you, Maurice,

06:45.796 --> 06:49.060
but you're little pet project
is the real threat.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.367
When he fails The Assessment,

06:51.454 --> 06:53.238
you die,

06:53.325 --> 06:55.458
along with any human
who knows his secret.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.723
And I wonder if he told

06:59.810 --> 07:01.464
that pretty little
girlfriend of his.

07:01.551 --> 07:02.726
No, she doesn't
know anything.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.162
You sure?

07:06.556 --> 07:10.125
If I kill Reginald now,

07:10.212 --> 07:13.084
you don't have to worry
about any of that.

07:13.171 --> 07:15.957
I'd kind of be
doing you a favor.

07:16.044 --> 07:19.526
Keep your claws off
of Reginald.

07:32.364 --> 07:33.453
Whoa!

07:35.977 --> 07:37.282
You sing like an angel.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.589
Do you know them?
Do they speak to you?

07:39.676 --> 07:40.808
Who?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.985
The angels.

07:44.072 --> 07:45.552
Yes, they're terrifying
in their glory,

07:45.639 --> 07:47.075
and yes,
they shaped us like clay,

07:47.162 --> 07:48.468
but I've never heard them
until I heard the sound

07:48.555 --> 07:50.470
of your voice.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.123
I think you might
be overestimating

07:52.210 --> 07:53.951
my singing ability.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.518
Well, if that's the case,
I'm afraid I have to kill you.

07:55.605 --> 07:57.999
A job's a job and so forth.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.305
You said the angels?
I know the angels.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.568
I talk to them all the time.
They're--

08:01.655 --> 08:03.221
they're the ones
who taught me to sing.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.049
Two angels in particular,

08:05.136 --> 08:07.704
Eric B and Rakim.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.750
Good guys as angels go.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.186
I knew it.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.320
I came to the city made
of rubber to kill you.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.018
Well, that's a terrible idea.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.410
I'm having second thoughts.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.977
I'm also very much
on board with that.

08:20.064 --> 08:22.153
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

08:22.240 --> 08:25.809
Because I've never,
ever, never

08:25.896 --> 08:28.595
said something like this before
and it embarrasses me,

08:28.682 --> 08:32.076
which is another emotion
I'm not familiar with.

08:32.163 --> 08:34.296
What a night I'm having.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.385
Okay.

08:39.388 --> 08:41.782
I've never been
in love before,

08:41.869 --> 08:44.524
and love is scarier than me.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.311
Oh, my God.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.095
Oh, my God.

08:57.667 --> 08:58.799
Oh, my God.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.503
- Maurice, hey.
- Oh, hey.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.766
Hey, you live around here?

09:09.853 --> 09:11.899
- I'm not too far.
- Oh.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.117
I was still wired
so I thought

09:13.204 --> 09:14.945
I'd get some fresh air.

09:15.032 --> 09:18.209
That was, uh,
quite the performance tonight.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.342
I've never seen Reggie
so happy.

09:20.429 --> 09:21.430
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:21.517 --> 09:22.649
But that's no surprise,

09:22.736 --> 09:24.476
Reginald is crazy about you.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.435
He talks about you nonstop.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.264
I probably shouldn't--

09:30.961 --> 09:32.441
It just feels like I know you

09:32.528 --> 09:35.618
because he's talked
about you so much.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.054
We kissed.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.839
- You and Reginald?
- Yeah.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.405
- Reginald Andres?
- Uh-huh.

09:40.492 --> 09:43.800
That Reginald?
What?

09:43.887 --> 09:45.323
How was it?

09:45.410 --> 09:47.804
How do you feel about tea?

09:51.547 --> 09:53.114
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

09:57.640 --> 10:01.688
So you and Reginald have
spent a lot of time together.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.168
Mm, at the delightful microcosm

10:04.255 --> 10:06.475
that is the Slushy Shack, yes.

10:06.562 --> 10:10.479
He has single-handedly
preserved my sanity.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.960
Time just flies by
when we're together.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.831
We can talk about
absolutely nothing

10:14.918 --> 10:17.181
and absolutely everything
at the same time.

10:17.268 --> 10:19.967
That's great you have someone
you can be an open book with.

10:20.054 --> 10:21.359
Yeah.

10:25.146 --> 10:29.803
But sometimes I feel like
it's a bit one-sided.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.370
How's that?

10:32.457 --> 10:34.808
I suppose
we all have walls up,

10:34.895 --> 10:38.376
but Reginald has
one giant wall.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.727
It's like there's something
in the way of him being

10:40.814 --> 10:42.032
completely honest with me.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.687
I don't know what.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.602
I don't know, maybe it's me.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.038
Maybe I'm just overthinking it.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.431
Yeah, you got it bad.

10:49.518 --> 10:52.129
Oh, I suppose I do.

10:52.216 --> 10:55.219
Look, Reginald has a lot
on his plate right now,

10:55.306 --> 10:56.786
and I'm sure he'll
tell you all about it

10:56.873 --> 10:59.006
once he's on the other side.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.922
Until then, we just gotta
take it easy on him.

11:02.009 --> 11:03.750
He's got it bad too, you know.

11:03.837 --> 11:07.057
Take care of him.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.276
You too.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.760
Mm.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.500
Good night, Sarah.
Thank you for the tea.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.024
Night.

11:33.257 --> 11:35.607
"Upon receipt of the deposit,

11:35.695 --> 11:38.915
there are no refunds
and no cancellations."

11:39.002 --> 11:42.310
No refunds.
That is your policy.

11:42.397 --> 11:45.443
So I can only assume that
that wire transfer you sent me

11:45.530 --> 11:47.445
was, I don't know, a gift?

11:47.532 --> 11:49.186
It's a refund,

11:49.273 --> 11:51.493
but since this job was
off the books,

11:51.580 --> 11:53.669
I'm sure you can give me
a little wiggle room.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.671
It's been a pleasure
not doing business with you.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.978
Nikki.

11:58.065 --> 12:01.242
I am giving you the chance
to finish the job

12:01.329 --> 12:04.898
as contracted
and salvage your reputation.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.638
No can do.
I'm on sabbatical.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.163
What happened to you?

12:09.250 --> 12:10.904
I know I hired crazy,

12:10.991 --> 12:13.733
but I didn't know
I hired batshit crazy.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.735
I-I don't know.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.301
I'm--I'm still figuring it out.

12:17.388 --> 12:18.868
Well, then do the job
and then figure it out.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.003
When my heart cracked open,

12:23.090 --> 12:25.701
I heard it crack.

12:25.788 --> 12:26.789
Hearts don't crack.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.618
- Mine did.
- Okay.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.359
I know I'm gonna regret
asking you this,

12:31.446 --> 12:36.059
but why did your heart
crack open?

12:39.323 --> 12:42.109
Have you ever seen
something so amazing

12:42.196 --> 12:44.372
it makes your whole world
go topsy-turvy?

12:47.070 --> 12:48.855
Like, hey, here's an example.

12:48.942 --> 12:51.727
The golden-voice wonder
you were hired to kill.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.295
No, no.

12:54.382 --> 12:59.691
Mm. Please tell me
you are not talking about...

12:59.779 --> 13:02.259
R-Reginald.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.610
I've never felt
like this before.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.699
He is everything
in the world to me.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.137
He is the night.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.835
He is the first taste of blood.

13:12.922 --> 13:15.055
He's a song.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.491
Thanks, Angela.

13:16.578 --> 13:17.971
I never would've met him
if it wasn't for you.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.407
So for that, I owe you--

13:19.494 --> 13:20.930
Don't!

13:21.017 --> 13:24.020
Just...

13:24.107 --> 13:25.413
go away.
- Okay.

13:30.200 --> 13:35.162
Oh, Reginald------- Andres.

13:39.949 --> 13:42.082
Been here, done this.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.474
The Assessment is
on the books, Reggie.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.346
Couple months out.
- Awesome.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.478
Plenty of time.
I can't wait.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.741
Look, it's all
about centering yourself.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.482
Clearing your mind
and trusting your instincts.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.049
You're a vampire now

13:53.136 --> 13:55.878
and with that comes
an innate primal intelligence.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.532
Okay?

13:57.619 --> 14:00.187
When faced with an obstacle,
your body,

14:00.274 --> 14:02.537
if you trust it,
will know exactly what to do,

14:02.624 --> 14:03.930
even if you've never
done it before.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.323
Visualize, believe, achieve.

14:06.410 --> 14:07.803
Mike was very emphatic
about that.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.674
Where is he?
- Um,

14:09.761 --> 14:12.242
Mike had to...

14:12.329 --> 14:14.462
Mike's nesting somewhere else.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.943
Nesting sounds nice.
Sounds really fun actually.

14:17.030 --> 14:17.987
Like having a bunch
of friends over

14:18.074 --> 14:20.294
who share similar interests.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.426
- Blood.
- Sure, that,

14:22.513 --> 14:25.168
or in my recent experience
with vampires,

14:25.255 --> 14:28.606
they're very keen on karaoke.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.696
No, stay away from Nikki.
She's a killer.

14:31.783 --> 14:34.482
Understood, but maybe there's
more to her than that.

14:34.569 --> 14:37.267
Everybody has a secret self
just waiting to be revealed.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.313
No, Nikki's
secret self is soaked

14:39.400 --> 14:41.141
in the blood
of everyone she's killed.

14:41.228 --> 14:44.187
Okay, and that's enough blood
to source the Nile.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.929
Okay, that's vivid
and pretty convincing.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.975
Yeah.

14:49.062 --> 14:50.193
What about Sarah?

14:50.280 --> 14:53.544
Sarah is my undead life goal.

14:53.631 --> 14:57.548
Very first vampire girlfriend.

14:57.635 --> 15:00.377
Yeah.
You know, believe it or not,

15:00.464 --> 15:02.118
I think I'm starting to see
the value in the two of you.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.294
You do? Me and Sarah?

15:04.381 --> 15:05.382
Yeah, you and Sarah.

15:08.255 --> 15:09.386
Okay.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.649
I think I'm ready.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.914
Fully centered.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.655
Visualizing, believing, achieving.

15:17.742 --> 15:18.743
This is my moment.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.049
That's the spirit.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.137
Go for it. Break that thing.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.530
All right.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.894
This hammer
is my big-ass brain.

15:38.981 --> 15:42.071
This broken piece of
cinderblock is The Assessment.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.768
Are there any questions?

15:51.776 --> 15:53.648
There's something
different about you.

15:53.735 --> 15:54.866
Me?

15:54.954 --> 15:58.218
You're, like, glowing.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.523
No, I'm not.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.917
Oh, my God,
you and Reginald had sex.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.832
No, we just kissed.

16:03.919 --> 16:09.055
Jeez, what happens to you
when you have sex?

16:09.142 --> 16:12.101
What can I say?
It was a pretty good kiss.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.886
Hey, this is
an interesting development.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.976
What's next on the carnal
to-do list?

16:17.063 --> 16:18.368
Good question.

16:18.455 --> 16:21.241
I guess only time will tell.

16:21.328 --> 16:22.546
You're not actually
waiting for Reginald

16:22.633 --> 16:24.200
to make the next more, are you?

16:24.287 --> 16:25.419
This is Reginald
we're talking here.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.247
Reginald has no game.

16:27.334 --> 16:31.468
If you want to get with him,
you better take the lead.

16:31.555 --> 16:32.948
Never thought about that.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.515
Take bonobos, for example.

16:34.602 --> 16:35.907
Bono-what?

16:35.995 --> 16:39.911
They're a super
sex positive primate.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.522
The females call all the shots.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.219
They decide when, where, who.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.829
One could argue
that bonobos are actually

16:44.916 --> 16:48.398
the most evolved primate
on the planet.

16:48.485 --> 16:51.793
So you want me to take
dating advice from a monkey?

16:51.880 --> 16:53.186
A very satisfied monkey.

17:05.328 --> 17:08.201
Welcome to the Slushy Shack.
How may I help you?

17:08.288 --> 17:09.941
I'm here to kill
my romantic rival.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.264
Hey, can you watch the till?
Thanks. Bye now.

17:28.351 --> 17:29.700
Sure.

17:29.787 --> 17:31.789
Isn't that sad karaoke lady?

17:37.839 --> 17:39.362
I'm glad you're
no longer crying blood.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.060
The homicidal ideation isn't
much of an improvement.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.974
It's nothing personal.
If I want something,

17:43.062 --> 17:45.281
I simply eliminate obstacles
standing in my way.

17:45.368 --> 17:48.067
That is very goal-oriented,

17:48.154 --> 17:51.592
but that doesn't really apply
to romantic interests.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.072
Well, I have to do something.

17:53.159 --> 17:56.031
I can't stop thinking
about him.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.164
- Who him?
- Reginald, of course.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.255
- Reginald Andres?
- Mm.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.651
Your romantic rival is
the nice lady serving slushies

18:07.738 --> 18:08.957
to thirsty customers out front?

18:09.044 --> 18:10.698
She is deader than dirt.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.486
Your eyeballs wobble
the tiniest fraction

18:16.573 --> 18:17.879
when you think.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.489
- They do?
- Mm-hmm.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.796
Nobody's ever
noticed that before.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.541
Falling in love is like...

18:29.282 --> 18:32.023
Being in a jumbo pot
of love soup.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.374
Love and all its by-products,

18:34.461 --> 18:37.290
fear, anxiety...

18:39.118 --> 18:40.989
Obsession.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.339
Giving a heart
to your one, true love.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.211
If you try to act
on all those emotions,

18:45.298 --> 18:47.822
including killing
your romantic rival,

18:47.909 --> 18:49.911
all at once,

18:49.998 --> 18:52.174
you're gonna end up alone
and in jail.

18:52.261 --> 18:54.002
As if any jail could hold me.

18:54.089 --> 18:55.656
Not the point.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.837
All right.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.578
I'm impressed
by your superior knowledge

19:04.665 --> 19:06.406
on the subject of romance.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.583
What do I do now?

19:09.670 --> 19:14.501
Uh, I'm thinking...

19:14.588 --> 19:16.503
let him take the lead.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.375
Reginald has game, so go slow.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.161
One year, maybe five.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.814
Time's a fungible concept anyways.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.555
Time is usually
not a problem for me,

19:25.642 --> 19:28.776
but in this case,
I don't think I can wait.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.952
I'm thinking...

19:33.563 --> 19:34.912
Today.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.654
- Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

19:37.741 --> 19:39.787
That's one way to go,
but is that really the best--

19:39.874 --> 19:40.918
I'm gonna give Reginald
my heart

19:41.005 --> 19:42.181
just like you told me to.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.495
Thanks for all your advice.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.280
You're really good
at this friend stuff.

19:56.325 --> 19:58.153
I tried.
I really did.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.634
What an odd lady.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.940
Hey, I've been thinking
about what you said.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.812
Isn't that just splendid.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.466
I'm gonna be like
the bonobos.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.076
I'm gonna call the shots.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.860
Thanks for your advice.
I really appreciate it.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.558
Reginald's not gonna know
what hit him.

20:11.645 --> 20:14.648
He sure won't.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.956
Whoa, whoa, not today.

20:19.043 --> 20:22.438
Not today,
not today, not today.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.527
Relax, you rotund imbecile.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.268
I'm here on business.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.836
Wh-what kind of business?

20:28.923 --> 20:31.665
Logan the Punctilious,
deacon of the Vampire Council,

20:31.752 --> 20:33.754
has asked me to reschedule
your Assessment

20:33.841 --> 20:35.669
to accommodate
his busy schedule.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.845
I brought a pen.

20:37.932 --> 20:40.848
Okay, well--

20:40.935 --> 20:44.330
He has to travel
all the way from Buenos Aires.

20:49.117 --> 20:51.728
I suppose I could use
more time to train.

20:51.815 --> 20:54.035
True, but we're
moving The Assessment up,

20:54.122 --> 20:55.776
not back.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.299
How does a month sound,
give or take?

20:57.386 --> 20:58.996
A month?

20:59.083 --> 21:01.042
That's not enough time
for anything.

21:01.129 --> 21:03.436
Well, I'm happy to take
your complaints to the Council,

21:03.523 --> 21:05.481
but you could lose more time
as a result.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.222
Oh, no, no,
I'm fine with the rescheduling.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.920
Hmm, can't be easy being you.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.835
I mean,
now that you mention it, I--

21:11.922 --> 21:13.141
wait, what?

21:13.228 --> 21:16.405
On the plus size,
you're unique.

21:16.492 --> 21:18.277
Plus size. Funny.

21:18.364 --> 21:22.063
On the minus,
everyone wants you dead.

21:22.150 --> 21:24.239
Into every life
must come a little rain.

21:24.326 --> 21:27.155
Wait, everybody?

21:27.242 --> 21:28.896
That seems a bit exaggerated,
don't you think?

21:28.983 --> 21:30.767
Not everybody wants me dead.

21:30.854 --> 21:32.769
I suppose
Maurice has your back.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.336
Exactly.

21:34.423 --> 21:37.644
And I'm assuming
that you have friends.

21:37.731 --> 21:39.907
Pretty awesome friends, actually.

21:39.994 --> 21:43.214
Also, a surprisingly
dynamic love life too.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.304
Love is all right.

21:45.391 --> 21:50.004
It's not worth dying for,
you understand, but...

21:50.091 --> 21:51.658
there are times
where living for it

21:51.745 --> 21:53.355
isn't the worst possible idea.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.662
You're talking about Maurice,
aren't you?

21:55.749 --> 21:57.011
He had your back too?

21:58.621 --> 22:00.493
Yes, he did.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.975
Well, this has...

22:05.062 --> 22:08.196
Been awesome.

22:08.283 --> 22:10.720
You and me, right?
Finding common ground.

22:10.807 --> 22:12.896
This is kind of crazy.

22:12.983 --> 22:14.289
Just a couple of vampires

22:14.376 --> 22:15.421
sitting around
talking about love.

22:15.508 --> 22:16.987
I want you deader than dirt.

22:17.074 --> 22:18.772
Every relationship has
its challenges.

22:18.859 --> 22:20.904
Nice chat, Blob.

22:20.991 --> 22:23.167
Enjoy the next four weeks
to the fullest.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.778
Like they were your last.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.216
Will do.

22:29.913 --> 22:33.569
Vampires are------- weird.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.675
Hey.

22:59.508 --> 23:01.597
Oh. Mm.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.517
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.042
Oh, oh, oh.

23:12.129 --> 23:13.304
Wait, wait.

23:15.045 --> 23:16.307
In the interest
of full disclosure,

23:16.395 --> 23:17.396
I have to tell you something.
- Oh.

23:17.483 --> 23:20.007
And brace yourself because,

23:20.094 --> 23:23.271
again fully aware of what
a shocker this is gonna be,

23:23.358 --> 23:24.881
but the thing
I wasn't telling you,

23:24.968 --> 23:29.625
my big, bold,
impossible secret is...

23:29.712 --> 23:31.932
I'm...

23:33.542 --> 23:37.067
I'm...

23:37.154 --> 23:38.329
a virgin.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.769
Oh.

23:58.045 --> 23:59.916
I'm glad you came back.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.527
Me too.

24:01.614 --> 24:05.139
The only thing is,
I can't figure out why.

24:05.226 --> 24:08.969
I need to make amends.

24:09.056 --> 24:12.276
That's the least attractive
sentence you've ever uttered.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.365
Well, what would you prefer?

24:15.932 --> 24:17.760
All right.

24:17.847 --> 24:22.461
Let's say amends
is the righteous thing.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.463
What exactly does that entail?

24:24.550 --> 24:26.987
I made a mistake.

24:29.859 --> 24:32.993
I put someone in danger
who does not deserve it,

24:33.080 --> 24:36.213
and I need to make sure
he does not die.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.433
Intriguing generalities.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.916
But...
- I'm gonna stop Angela

24:43.003 --> 24:44.700
before she kills
the fat vampire.

25:04.285 --> 25:07.506
Looks like someone could
use a pick-me-up.

25:07.593 --> 25:11.074
Pineapple surprise.

25:11.161 --> 25:14.077
That's, uh,
really sweet of you.

25:14.164 --> 25:16.427
Thank you.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.951
You know I'm just trying
to bribe you

25:18.038 --> 25:19.387
with your favorite slushy, right?

25:19.474 --> 25:21.389
I know. I'm sorry.

25:21.476 --> 25:23.173
I--I'm not trying
to ignore you.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.871
I just...

25:24.958 --> 25:27.003
I feel like the world's
biggest idiot.

25:27.090 --> 25:29.266
Like, that is not
how I wanted to tell you.

25:29.353 --> 25:30.703
Like I said last night,

25:30.790 --> 25:33.401
I think it's awesome
that you're a virgin

25:33.488 --> 25:35.055
and that you're waiting
for the right person.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.711
If I'm being honest,

25:38.798 --> 25:42.628
I never really had
a choice in the matter.

25:42.715 --> 25:45.413
It just never happened for me.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.068
I feel like virginity's
just a outdated concept

25:48.155 --> 25:51.724
to shame women anyway, but if I was

25:51.811 --> 25:54.074
waiting for a person,

25:54.161 --> 25:55.815
it would be you.

25:55.902 --> 25:59.775
From the very first date,
if that makes any sense.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.603
Completely.

26:05.215 --> 26:09.393
I think it's time
for our third date.

26:09.480 --> 26:12.092
You do?
I mean, I agree.

26:12.179 --> 26:14.007
It's--third time's
a charm, right?

26:14.094 --> 26:16.009
Yes, it will be.

26:16.096 --> 26:19.316
- You and me.
- Saturday night.

26:21.014 --> 26:24.191
Mm. Stolen moments
are the best kind.

26:25.714 --> 26:27.455
We're you wearing this
the entire time?

26:27.542 --> 26:30.980
Stop and is this rigatoni?

26:31.067 --> 26:34.114
The little rug rats
are crafty.

26:34.201 --> 26:35.942
I tried to compost it
the other night,

26:36.029 --> 26:38.031
but they caught me red-handed.

26:38.118 --> 26:42.165
They're keeping tabs on me
like secret agents.

26:45.908 --> 26:47.736
I need to take a page
from your book.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.697
Move through the world
like a glorious goddess

26:51.784 --> 26:54.221
no one will---- with.

26:56.658 --> 26:59.226
Not as glorious as it sounds.

26:59.313 --> 27:03.578
No? Why do you say that?

27:03.665 --> 27:08.801
Well, for starters,
that assassin that I hired,

27:08.888 --> 27:11.412
yeah, she had
a change of heart,

27:11.499 --> 27:15.938
which means Reginald is still
very much at large.

27:16.025 --> 27:19.681
I'm sure that Yukon brat
is cackling in her yurt.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.422
Yukon brat?

27:21.509 --> 27:24.730
Eve.

27:24.817 --> 27:27.515
Eve of my doom is more like it.

27:27.602 --> 27:30.431
She's, uh,
watching my every move,

27:30.518 --> 27:32.738
so I can't afford
another slip up,

27:32.825 --> 27:34.653
especially when I'm
expecting a visit

27:34.740 --> 27:37.699
from the esteemed head of
council, Logan the Vivisector.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.614
Nice nickname.

27:39.701 --> 27:42.182
Oh, he earned it.
Trust me.

27:42.269 --> 27:45.185
I may not be able to relate

27:45.272 --> 27:49.624
to the complexities
of the vampire underworld,

27:49.711 --> 27:55.674
but, um, I have my own little
monsters to contend with,

27:55.761 --> 28:01.680
and when plan A
and plan B fall through,

28:01.767 --> 28:05.248
there's usually a plan C.

28:05.335 --> 28:09.644
It's hiding in plain sight
and solves everything.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.303
See?
I knew I could count on you.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.739
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.527
Now, hand me my Spanx,

28:23.614 --> 28:25.355
'cause not all of us
are eternally 20.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.357
Oh, shut up.

28:27.444 --> 28:31.144
You are just as beautiful
as the first day we met.

28:31.231 --> 28:35.452
You know, you don't have
to hide your problems from me.

28:35.539 --> 28:40.849
Having feelings for you
and no sense of what hurts you,

28:40.936 --> 28:42.111
hurts.

28:42.198 --> 28:45.462
We talked about this.

28:45.549 --> 28:47.813
There are parts of my life

28:47.900 --> 28:51.468
that are best kept secret.

28:51.555 --> 28:54.254
It's dangerous to know
everything about me.

28:54.341 --> 28:57.953
It sounds like
the working definition of love.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.999
This is the only way
to keep you safe.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.438
Listen to me.

29:04.525 --> 29:06.309
Listen.

29:12.402 --> 29:14.230
Hey, what are you doing
up already?

29:14.317 --> 29:15.666
Oh, I just had a hankering.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.668
You always have a hankering.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.148
For you, I do.

29:27.722 --> 29:29.506
Oh, Reggie-boo.

29:29.593 --> 29:31.552
Anything for my ray
of sunshine.

29:34.947 --> 29:38.254
Wait.
Something's missing.

29:40.561 --> 29:43.129
On today's menu
we have an aromatic blend

29:43.216 --> 29:46.828
of A and B positive
with a dash of O.

29:46.915 --> 29:49.352
Oh, honey,
you shouldn't have.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.050
It's perfect.

29:56.490 --> 29:59.580
Uh--oh, oh, that's generous.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.451
I'm good though.
That's plenty.

30:01.538 --> 30:04.585
- But aren't you hungry?
- Not that hungry.

30:04.672 --> 30:07.718
Oh, don't be afraid,
Reggie-boo.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.765
<i>The only thing you have
to fear is me itself.</i>

30:10.852 --> 30:12.767
both: Good to the last drop.

30:12.854 --> 30:14.638
Good to the last drop.

30:14.725 --> 30:17.163
Good to the last drop.

30:17.250 --> 30:19.208
Good to the last drop.

30:32.787 --> 30:35.703
What a weird-ass dream.

30:49.325 --> 30:51.719
Don't be shy.

30:51.806 --> 30:55.679
I love presents,
and I brought one for you.

30:59.814 --> 31:03.078
I've never met a vampire
like you before.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.471
Okay.

31:04.558 --> 31:06.386
I'm intrigued if not terrified.

31:06.473 --> 31:10.303
Go on.
- You're soft, gentle.

31:10.390 --> 31:12.087
Made to cuddle, which doesn't

31:12.174 --> 31:13.132
have the advantages
you think it does.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.785
You sing like an angel.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.178
I'll take your word for it,
although all the evidence

31:16.265 --> 31:17.571
points towards the contrary.

31:17.658 --> 31:18.877
Here.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.406
This doesn't belong
to anyone I know, right?

31:26.493 --> 31:27.798
No, but there may be

31:27.886 --> 31:29.017
a slight delay
in your next mail delivery.

31:31.802 --> 31:36.024
Nikki, you seem so cool.

31:36.111 --> 31:37.678
Thank you.

31:37.765 --> 31:39.854
Most times people say my name,
it's all...

31:39.941 --> 31:43.727
"Nikki, you promised to stop
after the second fingernail.

31:43.814 --> 31:46.600
Please, God, make it stop."

31:46.687 --> 31:48.994
But I'm seeing someone
right now.

31:49.081 --> 31:51.605
Of course you are.
How could anyone resist?

31:51.692 --> 31:53.607
It's really serious.

31:56.653 --> 32:00.483
After briefly considering bloodshed...

32:00.570 --> 32:03.051
I've come to realize

32:03.138 --> 32:04.270
I have no problem with that.

32:04.357 --> 32:05.836
Three is a very
underrated number.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.752
And that's--
that's so generous of you,

32:08.839 --> 32:10.450
but it's just the two of us.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.278
You and me, two?

32:13.844 --> 32:15.629
No.

32:15.716 --> 32:18.284
I'm sorry.

32:18.371 --> 32:19.850
Please don't kill me.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.598
Time will tell
when it comes to you and me.

32:28.685 --> 32:33.473
But Reginald,
that thing inside you,

32:33.560 --> 32:36.041
the difference?

32:36.128 --> 32:41.133
It needs to be protected
from others like me,

32:41.220 --> 32:43.570
because they don't love you
like I do.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.483
- Hey, there.
- Hi.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.833
Welcome to the Slushy Shack.
How may I help you?

33:29.920 --> 33:34.621
That is a tough question.

33:36.275 --> 33:40.018
There's just so many flavors.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.978
How am I ever gonna choose?

33:58.036 --> 34:00.081
It's wild to think
of all the decisions

34:00.168 --> 34:01.648
that led us to this moment.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.563
Like, who knows?

34:03.650 --> 34:06.392
I could be selling bagels
and you could be selling,

34:06.479 --> 34:08.568
I don't know, comic books or...

34:08.655 --> 34:10.526
- Fitness equipment.
- Shut up.

34:10.613 --> 34:12.746
Yeah, I applied to that
one place down the street

34:12.833 --> 34:16.532
and they accepted me,
but, you know,

34:16.619 --> 34:19.709
the Slushy Shack had
better staff discounts,

34:19.796 --> 34:22.408
cuter uniforms,
cuter employees.

34:22.495 --> 34:25.150
- Oh, is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

34:25.237 --> 34:27.369
So this whole time,
you've been my Heathcliff?

34:27.456 --> 34:29.893
I may have been
lowkey brooding.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.634
Are you still reading
"Wuthering Heights?"

34:31.721 --> 34:33.114
I finished it actually.

34:33.201 --> 34:34.550
Yeah, the book
cover should read,

34:34.637 --> 34:36.639
"When unbridled passion
meets unrequited love,

34:36.726 --> 34:37.945
shit gets ugly."

34:38.032 --> 34:40.034
Right?
It's a total bummer,

34:40.121 --> 34:42.819
and at the end of the day,
nothing mattered 'cause...

34:42.906 --> 34:44.995
both: They were together.

34:50.305 --> 34:53.091
So this place is nice.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.483
Wonder what
the rooms look like.

34:56.485 --> 35:01.316
Guess we're gonna have
to figure that out on our own.

35:01.403 --> 35:03.927
- Think we should?
- Absolutely, yes. 100%.

35:04.014 --> 35:05.451
I'm, like, not even
kidding right now.

35:05.538 --> 35:06.713
I'm so--

35:20.379 --> 35:21.815
I have to pee.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.779
Hey, there's way
too much soda in this.

35:29.866 --> 35:32.130
Whoa--no.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.137
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- What does it look like?

35:39.224 --> 35:42.009
I'm a mixologist serving
alcohol to needy customers.

35:42.096 --> 35:44.011
Is this really a job or
is this entry-level stalking?

35:44.098 --> 35:45.969
I thought everything
between us was cool.

35:46.056 --> 35:47.406
Is that blood on your shirt?

35:50.583 --> 35:51.888
Nikki, you can't be here.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.542
But my shift isn't over
until midnight.

35:53.629 --> 35:54.848
What?

36:00.810 --> 36:02.986
- You okay?
- Great.

36:03.073 --> 36:04.901
Never better.

36:04.988 --> 36:06.729
Dessert?

36:06.816 --> 36:08.383
Tranquilizer?

36:08.470 --> 36:10.820
You pick.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.216
Oh, my God.
- What?

36:15.303 --> 36:17.044
I might've left my phone
in the bathroom.

36:17.131 --> 36:18.828
- Oh, you want me to call it?
- No, it's fine.

36:18.915 --> 36:21.266
How about you decide
on dessert?

36:21.353 --> 36:24.138
And make sure that
it's vegan and gluten-free.

36:24.225 --> 36:27.663
But you had steak for dinner
and some of my chicken.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.535
What do you think
you're doing?

36:29.622 --> 36:32.712
I'm bringing you signature
Nikki cocktails on the house.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.496
Okay, great.
Drinks received.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.150
Go now.
We don't need any more appies.

36:45.159 --> 36:47.727
Hello? Earth to Reginald.

36:47.814 --> 36:49.207
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.905
Um, I'm s-I'm sorry,
I just...

36:51.992 --> 36:53.167
I can't believe
all this is happening.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.865
Me too.
Is this sangria?

36:55.952 --> 36:57.824
Yeah, sure.

36:59.739 --> 37:02.002
Mm, it's good.

37:02.089 --> 37:03.873
Has... a bit
of a weird aftertaste.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.486
Tastes like coppery.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.139
Oh, that one's actually mine.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.837
What'd you put in here?
Truffle oil?

37:10.924 --> 37:12.273
Oh, Reginald.
- Sorry.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.537
I'm-I'm really sorry.
I...I'm just so nervous.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.887
Hey, you don't have to
be nervous.

37:17.974 --> 37:20.063
Not with me.
Not with us.

37:20.150 --> 37:23.328
Ohh...
you're right, you're right.

37:23.415 --> 37:26.722
Us is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

37:26.809 --> 37:29.638
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay, yeah.

37:40.736 --> 37:44.436
For the ambience,
for the mood,

37:44.523 --> 37:48.614
and... for the senses.

37:48.701 --> 37:52.313
Thank you for doing all this.
This is so nice.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.185
Is it too much?
God, it's too much, isn't it?

37:55.273 --> 37:58.754
I'm so glad that I skipped
on that mariachi band.

37:58.841 --> 38:01.191
Okay, it's just...

38:01.279 --> 38:04.282
I know it's your first time,
and it's our first time.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.632
And I just... I want it
to be special.

38:06.719 --> 38:08.503
I can pretty much
guarantee you

38:08.590 --> 38:11.158
that this is gonna be the most
special night of my life.

38:14.117 --> 38:16.555
Why are you so sweet?

38:16.642 --> 38:19.079
I'm so nervous.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.569
This is really happening.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.266
It's really happening.

38:32.353 --> 38:35.269
I cannot tell you how many
nights I've dreamt of this.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.968
I visualized it.
I believed it.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.927
I achieved it.

38:41.014 --> 38:43.669
Actualization pillow talk
is the sexiest pillow talk.

38:43.756 --> 38:44.757
- Right?
- Yeah.

38:46.976 --> 38:48.587
Ready?
- Yeah.

38:51.546 --> 38:53.461
Don't move.
I'll be right back.

38:53.548 --> 38:55.811
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.280
<i>Hey, welcome to
the Slushy Shack.</i>

39:30.368 --> 39:31.586
<i>How may I help you?</i>

39:31.673 --> 39:34.067
<i>That is a tough question.</i>

39:34.154 --> 39:35.764
Listen to me.

39:35.851 --> 39:38.201
Listen... listen...

40:09.319 --> 40:12.366
Okay, be cool.
Just go with the flow.

40:12.453 --> 40:14.629
You just have to unlock your...

40:19.329 --> 40:20.940
Instinct.

40:29.165 --> 40:32.212
You're gonna wanna close
your eyes for this next part.

40:32.299 --> 40:35.084
Okay,
but remember, be careful.

40:35.171 --> 40:37.522
I'm your gentle,
delicate, little flower.

40:37.609 --> 40:40.481
Don't worry, Reginald.

40:40.568 --> 40:43.092
It'll be over
before you know what hit you.

40:45.530 --> 40:48.097
Whoa, whoa, hey!

40:48.184 --> 40:50.186
Did you see that?
I almost got staked.

40:50.273 --> 40:51.927
Wait, Sarah. Is she okay?

40:52.014 --> 40:53.494
She was the one trying
to stake you, remember?

40:53.581 --> 40:55.322
I'd give her some space.
- What? That's impossible.

40:55.409 --> 40:57.324
I know Sarah.
- You sure about that?

40:57.411 --> 40:59.369
'Cause her weapon of choice
was very specific.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.154
In my experience,
only humans of a certain kind

41:01.241 --> 41:02.372
know how to find us
and kill us.

41:02.460 --> 41:03.852
No, no, absolutely not.

41:03.939 --> 41:05.419
There's no way that Sarah,

41:05.506 --> 41:07.900
my Sarah, is a vampire slayer.

41:11.077 --> 41:12.992
She bounced back fast.

41:13.079 --> 41:14.297
I killed a slayer
in Walla Walla.

41:14.384 --> 41:15.473
She wasn't really a slayer.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.648
Learned about it
from a comic book.

41:16.735 --> 41:18.432
I rammed her stake
down her throat.

41:18.519 --> 41:20.565
Ironic, right?
Or is it just a coincidence?

41:20.652 --> 41:21.827
Don't kill her.
Don't hurt her, please.

41:21.914 --> 41:23.611
Spoilsport.

41:23.698 --> 41:25.961
This is all
just a big misunderstanding.

41:28.094 --> 41:29.312
"Oh, hey, Reginald.
How did your date go?"

41:29.399 --> 41:30.705
"Oh, it went great. Thanks.

41:30.792 --> 41:31.924
"We had a lovely dinner
at the restaurant

41:32.011 --> 41:32.925
"and then we went
to the hotel room

41:33.012 --> 41:34.535
"where she tried to kill me.

41:34.622 --> 41:35.928
"You know how it goes.

41:36.015 --> 41:37.973
"Kissing one moment,
then screaming the next.

41:38.060 --> 41:40.323
"And then your vampire stalker
comes and saves you

41:40.410 --> 41:41.368
"and locks your girlfriend
in a closet

41:41.455 --> 41:42.978
"because as fate would have it,

41:43.065 --> 41:45.677
I'm in love with Buffy
the------- Vampire Slayer!"

41:48.201 --> 41:50.159
"Okay, it was great knowing
you, Reginald.

41:50.246 --> 41:53.511
Have fun dying."

41:59.212 --> 42:00.996
Here.
This will calm you down.
