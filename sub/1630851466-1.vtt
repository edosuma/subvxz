00:01.310 --> 00:04.009
(Episode 1)

00:33.609 --> 00:34.609
Hey!

00:35.369 --> 00:37.280
Go get a young girl.

00:37.479 --> 00:39.079
- Okay.
- Go!

00:59.460 --> 01:01.770
What are you doing?
Come with me now.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.170
Where are you?

01:40.840 --> 01:43.409
Did the person that just left
really leave on a boat?

01:43.409 --> 01:45.439
What the heck are you doing?

01:46.209 --> 01:47.909
Do you think I'm a joke?

01:57.290 --> 01:58.489
Found you.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.359
No, please don't.

02:02.359 --> 02:04.099
You idiot.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.330
- Please let her live.
- What's with you?

02:11.870 --> 02:14.469
Please help my daughter.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.810
Please help her.

02:38.060 --> 02:39.400
Dad...

04:03.210 --> 04:04.580
(Sea Special Attack Team)

04:21.870 --> 04:24.339
Sir, I think you need to come here.

04:25.540 --> 04:26.740
Roger.

04:35.449 --> 04:36.850
Watch out for dead bodies ahead.

04:51.699 --> 04:53.100
(Sea Special Attack Team)

04:56.829 --> 04:58.300
A person ahead. Get ready.

04:58.569 --> 05:00.439
Come out!

05:01.470 --> 05:02.509
Enter.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.189
Enter.

05:28.029 --> 05:29.600
Hands up!

05:29.600 --> 05:31.139
Put your hands up!

05:33.100 --> 05:34.970
Please help...

05:45.879 --> 05:48.490
Put your hands up!

05:48.490 --> 05:51.089
Drop your weapon! Put your hands up!

06:01.529 --> 06:03.129
Standby. Do not shoot.

06:03.129 --> 06:06.300
Disclose your identity!

06:07.110 --> 06:08.670
If you don't, we'll shoot!

06:11.339 --> 06:12.509
Four.

06:14.980 --> 06:16.050
Seven.

06:18.350 --> 06:19.850
Four. Nine.

06:23.449 --> 06:24.889
This was the gunshot.

06:27.689 --> 06:29.860
Chief Ha,
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

06:29.860 --> 06:31.529
- What is it?
- The Coast Guard just tried...

06:31.529 --> 06:34.269
to identify one of our staff,
so I looked into it,

06:34.269 --> 06:35.569
but the file is locked.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.439
It's locked?

06:37.439 --> 06:39.240
I can't access it
with my clearance level.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.110
(National Intelligence Service)

06:48.180 --> 06:49.680
- Put it up.
- Yes, sir.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.079
- Can you put it up on the screen?
- Yes, I will.

06:56.519 --> 06:57.790
(Han Ji Hyuk)

06:57.790 --> 06:59.759
(Han Ji Hyuk, NIS Black Agent,
Foreign Intelligence, Class 5)

07:03.759 --> 07:06.360
The paperwork states
he's already dead.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.269
- Who did it?
- Sorry?

07:11.269 --> 07:13.000
Who tried to identify him?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.709
Western Regional Coast Guard.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.339
Contact the director. Now.

07:26.180 --> 07:29.050
What is it? It's my day off.

07:30.420 --> 07:31.720
What is it?

07:35.459 --> 07:36.490
What?

07:42.269 --> 07:43.399
Yes, I already checked.

07:43.399 --> 07:45.870
I compared the fingerprint
the Coast Guard ran, and it's him.

07:45.870 --> 07:47.310
It's Agent Han Jin Hyuk.

07:47.639 --> 07:49.540
Okay. How is he?

07:50.209 --> 07:53.480
I don't have information on that.
I'll have to check myself.

07:54.910 --> 07:57.279
You know that this information
cannot be leaked out, right?

07:58.350 --> 08:00.480
Do whatever it takes
to bring him here.

08:00.689 --> 08:01.889
Don't worry, sir.

08:04.959 --> 08:06.160
(Repatriation of Agent Han Ji Hyuk)

08:06.560 --> 08:07.790
As you're aware,

08:07.790 --> 08:11.199
when our agency or civilians are
damaged by our enemies,

08:11.300 --> 08:13.430
we track down the cause
and carry out...

08:13.430 --> 08:15.129
retaliation operations.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.199
We kept Heukyang in operation,

08:17.199 --> 08:19.370
a team of elite agents
under the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

08:19.569 --> 08:21.810
It's a secret task force.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.639
And Han Ji Hyuk
belonged to Heukyang.

08:24.639 --> 08:28.350
He was the best field agent we had
who successfully executed...

08:28.750 --> 08:30.550
our projects abroad.

08:31.050 --> 08:32.080
And this is his best work.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.080
(Name: Han Ji Hyuk)

08:33.080 --> 08:35.019
Three years, in Libya,

08:35.019 --> 08:38.690
two of our agents were publicly
executed by an armed organization.

08:38.860 --> 08:41.029
And Heukyang was able to eliminate
the leader of the organization,

08:41.029 --> 08:44.100
Abu-nidal,
after pursuing him for months.

08:44.559 --> 08:47.159
He even impressed
international media outlets.

09:01.750 --> 09:02.909
Detective Kim.

09:13.759 --> 09:14.789
What's going on?

09:16.090 --> 09:17.899
(Korea Coast Guard)

09:25.500 --> 09:26.600
A year ago,

09:26.899 --> 09:29.240
three of our agents
who were dispatched...

09:29.240 --> 09:31.639
to China and North Korea
were murdered.

09:32.179 --> 09:34.009
Han Ji Hyuk along with other agents
from Heukyang...

09:34.009 --> 09:35.649
were assigned to the case.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.620
And they acquired intel...

09:37.620 --> 09:39.480
that there was a drug cartel
that dealt drugs from North Korea.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.289
They were able to destroy
the network...

09:41.289 --> 09:43.389
and on the verge
of completing their mission.

09:44.090 --> 09:45.490
And during the operation,

09:45.789 --> 09:48.059
two of the agents from Heukyang
and Han Ji Hyuk...

09:48.529 --> 09:50.860
vanished without any trace.

09:51.299 --> 09:54.730
Back then, we utilized
all of our resources to find them.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.269
But we weren't able to find
Han's body in the end.

09:57.269 --> 09:58.399
(Incident Summary)

09:58.870 --> 09:59.940
Please take a look at this.

10:04.710 --> 10:06.139
This footage was filmed
around 5 a.m. today...

10:06.139 --> 10:08.950
from a ship that was drifting
on the West Coast.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.450
Who's that?

10:15.649 --> 10:18.519
I know it may be hard to believe,
but that's Han Ji Hyuk.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.639
Is he Jesus or something?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.070
Pardon?

10:33.070 --> 10:34.470
I mean, think about it.

10:34.470 --> 10:36.740
He's risen from the dead.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.379
Doesn't that ring a bell?

10:45.080 --> 10:48.389
How could you handle
this matter so poorly?

10:48.620 --> 10:51.860
You made a perfectly healthy man
into a corpse.

10:53.389 --> 10:56.429
Well, you know that we always
have a good reason for it.

10:56.590 --> 10:58.559
After that agent went missing
a year ago,

10:59.100 --> 11:02.799
the list of our international agents
in China got leaked.

11:02.799 --> 11:04.200
(Jung Yong Tae: Director
of Security Investigations Division)

11:04.200 --> 11:06.840
And then we lost all of our agents
for North Korea.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.009
It's known
as the Bloody Friday Incident.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.340
Hey, Director Jung.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.240
That's enough.

11:13.309 --> 11:15.009
Right. That's true.

11:15.379 --> 11:17.450
We did rush to close the case...

11:17.450 --> 11:20.149
due to the diplomatic conflict
between us and China.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.889
Thanks to that, weren't you
able to cover up your scandal...

11:23.889 --> 11:26.289
regarding surveilling
innocent civilians?

11:26.289 --> 11:28.429
I remember that caused
quite a headache for you.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.700
And we are bringing him in
as we speak.

11:34.870 --> 11:38.639
If you give us a bit more time,
we'll get to the bottom of this.

11:39.539 --> 11:42.409
Sure. I don't think
we need to make a big fuss about it.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.440
But as you are the experts
in this field,

11:45.440 --> 11:47.679
please take care of this
however you see fit.

11:48.450 --> 11:49.480
Sir.

11:50.149 --> 11:54.190
I have arranged what we talked about
for the appointment...

11:54.590 --> 11:56.149
of the Minister of Justice
last week.

11:56.450 --> 11:57.919
I'll brief you in the afternoon.

12:01.129 --> 12:03.360
Don't let me keep you here.
You can get back to work now.

12:03.659 --> 12:04.759
Go ahead.

12:05.860 --> 12:06.929
Please.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.330
Okay. Thank you for your time.

12:13.940 --> 12:15.669
It seems that they were
smuggling these people...

12:15.669 --> 12:17.009
into the country...

12:17.009 --> 12:19.009
and harvesting their organs
against their will on the ship.

12:19.210 --> 12:22.710
The rest of the people were found
a few kilometers away in a rubber boat.

12:24.649 --> 12:26.279
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.950
Why do you think Han Ji Hyuk was...

12:28.590 --> 12:30.090
on that ship?

12:30.090 --> 12:32.659
Wasn't he trying
to come back to Korea?

12:33.320 --> 12:36.129
They probably didn't know
they were trafficking organs.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.860
No, listen.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.169
Why did he try to come back
as a stowaway?

12:42.370 --> 12:43.370
That's...

12:47.340 --> 12:48.370
Ji Hyuk.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.440
Han Ji Hyuk.

12:57.309 --> 13:00.379
By the way, the Korea Coast Guard
was able to find the ship.

13:01.419 --> 13:03.590
- They said they got a tip.
- What?

13:05.019 --> 13:06.059
A tip?

13:06.059 --> 13:08.029
I looked into it just in case.

13:08.159 --> 13:09.830
The person who gave them the tip...

13:09.830 --> 13:12.360
used an untraceable line
just like we do.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.730
Are you sure?

13:14.200 --> 13:15.230
Yes, sir.

13:21.210 --> 13:25.039
The professional go player,
Lee Se Dol, didn't give up...

13:25.039 --> 13:28.610
and managed to win a match
that's worth his every effort.

13:28.610 --> 13:29.879
Let's hear more
from Reporter Lee Jun Beom.

13:30.509 --> 13:33.820
The AI machine, AlphaGo,
waves the white flag in the end.

13:34.049 --> 13:37.519
The first victory of Lee Se Dol
has been confirmed...

13:44.960 --> 13:46.600
The scars on his body tell us...

13:46.600 --> 13:48.200
he was tortured and locked up
for a very long time.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.970
Other than he's dehydrated,
his numbers look good.

13:54.509 --> 13:55.539
But...

13:55.940 --> 13:59.210
we found dozens of neurochemical
substances in his blood.

13:59.779 --> 14:01.750
Neurochemical substances?

14:01.909 --> 14:05.379
And among them, there's a substance
called Zet-IP, also known as ZIP.

14:05.620 --> 14:06.649
So what that drug does is that...

14:07.049 --> 14:09.990
it affects our brain
and wipes out our memory.

14:10.289 --> 14:13.259
Well, we are developing it
on our end to treat...

14:13.259 --> 14:14.789
post traumatic stress disorders.

14:15.590 --> 14:17.830
I don't follow you.

14:17.960 --> 14:22.100
In other words, someone had injected
him with small doses of ZIP...

14:22.100 --> 14:24.639
and erased Han Ji Hyuk's memory.

14:25.639 --> 14:27.299
Of course, it was done on purpose.

14:27.399 --> 14:30.340
Are you telling me
he lost his memory?

14:30.740 --> 14:31.779
Yes.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.840
To be precise,

14:34.009 --> 14:37.679
he doesn't have any memory
since his disappearance until now.

14:38.149 --> 14:41.190
It's like someone had carved out
his brain.

14:41.450 --> 14:44.690
He doesn't remember a thing
for the past year.

14:46.659 --> 14:48.090
This isn't your first time, right?

14:48.990 --> 14:50.029
I read in your record that...

14:50.029 --> 14:51.830
you underwent
the captivity avoidance training.

14:52.429 --> 14:54.299
Let me clarify it just in case.

14:54.299 --> 14:56.269
This is
a completely different device.

14:56.830 --> 14:59.100
It can record your heart rate,
blood pressure, brainwaves,

14:59.440 --> 15:01.570
and even minor vibrations
in your eyes and ears.

15:02.909 --> 15:05.580
What I want to do right now
is very simple.

15:06.710 --> 15:08.049
I just need to evaluate...

15:08.149 --> 15:10.009
if you're telling me
the truth or not.

15:10.350 --> 15:13.580
And I will be reporting the result
to your superior.

15:13.950 --> 15:14.990
If...

15:15.789 --> 15:19.120
you are hiding something right now,

15:20.620 --> 15:22.590
you are making a big mistake.

15:24.460 --> 15:25.460
All right.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.429
Let us begin.

15:29.669 --> 15:30.769
It says...

15:31.440 --> 15:33.899
your name is Han Ji Hyuk.
Is that correct?

15:35.970 --> 15:39.009
Let me ask you again.
Is your name Han Ji Hyuk?

15:40.509 --> 15:41.549
Yes.

15:44.149 --> 15:46.179
Did you work for
the National Intelligence Service?

15:46.850 --> 15:47.850
Yes.

15:48.289 --> 15:50.919
Do you live
in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province?

15:51.820 --> 15:52.860
Yes.

15:52.860 --> 15:55.730
You said that the last memory
you have is having dinner...

15:55.730 --> 15:57.629
with your colleagues,

15:57.830 --> 16:00.429
Kim Dong Wook and Oh Kyung Seok,
at a safe house on the outskirts...

16:00.429 --> 16:01.970
of Andong on February 29 last year.

16:02.269 --> 16:03.470
Is that correct?

16:04.230 --> 16:05.269
Yes.

16:06.940 --> 16:10.039
And is it also true that
you don't remember what happened...

16:10.039 --> 16:13.240
over the last year since that night?

16:14.480 --> 16:15.549
Yes.

16:16.179 --> 16:17.509
And you heard that your colleagues,

16:17.509 --> 16:20.620
Oh Kyung Seok
and Kim Dong Wook died. Correct?

16:21.590 --> 16:24.220
Were you involved in their deaths?

16:24.220 --> 16:25.990
Or is there anything you remember
about their deaths?

16:30.230 --> 16:31.600
Let me ask you again.

16:32.299 --> 16:34.799
Were you involved in...

16:34.970 --> 16:37.299
Oh Kyung Seok
and Kim Dong Wook's deaths?

16:38.940 --> 16:39.940
No.

16:42.840 --> 16:45.179
Have you contacted or been
in contact with other individuals...

16:45.179 --> 16:48.850
from other groups or organizations
during your operations?

16:48.850 --> 16:50.279
Is this it?

16:54.990 --> 16:56.019
Is this...

16:59.259 --> 17:03.289
how you show respect to a man
who escaped the jaws of death?

17:03.990 --> 17:07.160
Mr. Han. Just answer my questions.

17:08.900 --> 17:12.269
It's me who should be asking
questions, not you.

17:13.369 --> 17:14.940
So don't hide
behind that glass window...

17:14.940 --> 17:16.470
and come face me.

17:19.309 --> 17:20.839
So listen.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.849
Mr. Han, please don't move.

17:25.849 --> 17:28.089
- Stay seated.
- Stop hiding there.

17:29.619 --> 17:32.420
Come out this instant!

18:18.970 --> 18:21.269
Tell me. What's the result?

18:21.509 --> 18:23.069
My analysis tells me...

18:23.440 --> 18:25.839
he's telling us the truth.

18:26.509 --> 18:29.980
Nothing in my analysis told me
that he was lying.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.019
Good job. You may go.

18:40.559 --> 18:41.660
Director Kang.

18:42.089 --> 18:43.089
Yes, ma'am.

18:43.430 --> 18:45.000
What's our next step?

18:53.539 --> 18:55.069
(Dandong, China, one year ago)

19:05.980 --> 19:07.650
You should buy drinks.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.119
Seriously? You're so cheap.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.289
What do you want to eat?

19:13.990 --> 19:16.190
Let me think.

19:21.670 --> 19:24.640
They're on the move.
They're going down.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.769
Got it.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.450
I taking her to a nice place tonight.

19:38.450 --> 19:40.849
- There you go again.
- I'm serious.

19:41.390 --> 19:43.220
- Really?
- Of course.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.359
Her butt was this big!

19:47.059 --> 19:48.529
Want to make a bet?

19:48.660 --> 19:50.390
Go and see for yourself tonight.

19:50.759 --> 19:52.900
- Okay.
- Fine.

19:59.039 --> 20:00.700
- Hwang Young?
- What?

20:03.769 --> 20:04.880
Who are you?

20:58.799 --> 21:01.259
- Where is it?
- Over there.

21:53.619 --> 21:55.819
I'm sure they've lost it by now.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.450
Without a doubt.

21:57.690 --> 22:00.289
The amount of ice they lost
because of us...

22:00.460 --> 22:02.029
has got to be couple hundred kilos.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.660
- How much do you think it costs?
- Why? Do you regret it?

22:04.660 --> 22:06.230
I'm just asking.

22:06.460 --> 22:07.759
Why are you...

22:07.759 --> 22:10.329
Why are you putting it like that?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.039
It'll be ten months next month.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.869
What are you going to do
when this is over?

22:13.869 --> 22:17.039
When I get back this time,
I'm going to ask for a desk job.

22:17.740 --> 22:19.279
I'm serious.

22:19.279 --> 22:21.609
I'm never coming
near the field again.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.509
Dong Wook,
your face is meant for the field.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.880
Want to die?

22:26.250 --> 22:27.420
What about you?

22:27.819 --> 22:29.990
You still haven't figured it out,
have you?

22:29.990 --> 22:31.819
Ji Hyuk prefers the field to home.

22:31.819 --> 22:33.190
I bet he's going to ask...

22:33.190 --> 22:34.859
to be sent to the field
as soon as we get back to HQ.

22:35.460 --> 22:36.460
Right?

22:37.390 --> 22:39.730
See? What about you?

22:39.759 --> 22:42.170
I want to go somewhere for a couple
of weeks and get some rest.

22:43.430 --> 22:44.940
Have you heard of Palawan?

22:44.940 --> 22:47.200
Why do you belittle me so much?
Of course, I do.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.309
- No, you don't.
- I do.

22:49.309 --> 22:52.140
There's this resort
right by the beach there,

22:52.779 --> 22:56.579
and the view of the sunset
from the terrace is amazing.

22:56.910 --> 22:58.819
Imagine watching that view...

22:58.819 --> 23:00.680
and ordering crab balls
from room service...

23:02.950 --> 23:04.390
You went there with a woman,
didn't you?

23:04.960 --> 23:08.019
No wonder you were always
so busy texting in the corner.

23:08.829 --> 23:10.930
- No.
- What?

23:11.329 --> 23:13.400
I must be right!

23:14.359 --> 23:16.829
- He must've gone with a woman.
- I didn't!

23:16.829 --> 23:19.769
- Isn't this neglect of duty?
- I didn't!

23:19.769 --> 23:21.940
What do you mean you didn't?
Who is it?

23:21.940 --> 23:23.109
You should...

24:14.720 --> 24:16.029
Calm down.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.660
You're in a state of hypnosis.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.670
Exhale slowly.

24:33.309 --> 24:34.640
Slowly.

24:38.849 --> 24:40.180
From now on,

24:40.920 --> 24:43.789
we're going back to the period of time
that you can't remember.

24:44.250 --> 24:47.759
We're going to break through
the barriers and go inside.

24:49.190 --> 24:50.960
When I start counting,

24:51.329 --> 24:54.059
you will go into the gap
of your memories.

24:55.130 --> 24:57.329
Five, four,

24:57.529 --> 25:00.940
three, two, one.

25:06.109 --> 25:09.609
Okay. What do you see?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.759
Darkness.

25:32.369 --> 25:33.900
Calm down. You're okay.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.640
Take a deep breath. Slowly.

25:37.109 --> 25:39.180
You're going to wake up on my count.

25:39.180 --> 25:40.339
Three, two, one!

25:46.049 --> 25:49.019
I think we overdid it when
you're weak in both mind and spirit.

25:51.490 --> 25:53.019
Get some rest.

26:13.880 --> 26:15.150
Put that down.

26:16.609 --> 26:18.079
Put that down!

26:45.140 --> 26:47.509
Even if he was in
a state of hypnosis,

26:47.509 --> 26:49.509
I can't believe he did
something so radical.

26:50.079 --> 26:52.420
What on earth did he see?

26:53.180 --> 26:56.450
While he was in that state,
he said he saw darkness.

26:57.250 --> 26:58.589
There's a saying.

26:59.119 --> 27:00.559
The reason why you enter darkness...

27:00.789 --> 27:02.890
is because your memories
are reacting.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.160
Then does that mean...

27:05.329 --> 27:08.900
those memories
will eventually return?

27:13.170 --> 27:16.269
So you're saying that hypnosis
didn't work either?

27:17.269 --> 27:18.269
Yes, ma'am.

27:18.980 --> 27:20.309
Is there anything else we can try?

27:20.579 --> 27:24.450
To be honest, there's nothing
more we can try at this point.

27:25.220 --> 27:27.180
I think it's best to let him
get some rest...

27:27.180 --> 27:28.920
as we continue to watch him.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.859
Did you hear the rumors
floating around these days?

27:40.859 --> 27:43.170
What? What kind of rumors?

27:43.500 --> 27:46.640
I heard that everyone's talking
about how Han Ji Hyuk...

27:47.069 --> 27:49.910
was the one who released
the list of agents a year ago.

27:51.609 --> 27:55.250
That the person who was once
deemed the best agent...

27:56.150 --> 27:59.079
is the main culprit that dragged
down an entire division.

28:00.450 --> 28:02.789
But do you know what's
really interesting?

28:03.250 --> 28:06.289
Our last hope to save us
from this mire...

28:07.519 --> 28:09.160
is also him.

28:11.259 --> 28:14.230
Everything is settled
at the bottom of his mind.

28:14.730 --> 28:17.769
We can't just sit back
and wait for it to float.

28:19.470 --> 28:20.640
Han Ji Hyuk.

28:21.769 --> 28:23.309
Reinstate him right away.

28:25.480 --> 28:28.009
Ma'am, I think it's too soon to...

28:28.009 --> 28:30.750
You decide which department
he'll be assigned to.

28:32.150 --> 28:33.920
Let him catch his breath for now.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.019
What do you think?

28:39.690 --> 28:42.789
Tell me what you really think
not your professional opinion.

28:44.089 --> 28:47.130
You're the one who recruited him.

28:50.599 --> 28:52.299
Do you really think Han Ji Hyuk...

28:52.970 --> 28:54.970
lost his memory?

28:55.109 --> 28:56.410
(Silent Devotion to Protect
and Bring Glory to Korea)

29:01.180 --> 29:02.180
To be honest,

29:03.079 --> 29:05.319
I always wondered...

29:06.220 --> 29:08.750
what has he got in his head.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.890
Even a higher being
will never know...

29:14.190 --> 29:15.529
what he's thinking.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.440
What do you see?

29:34.279 --> 29:35.450
A lion.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.309
What about this one?

29:39.480 --> 29:40.619
A lion.

29:44.089 --> 29:45.319
A lion.

29:50.930 --> 29:52.130
And this one?

30:28.160 --> 30:31.529
He's accepting his
colleague's death as his failure.

30:33.099 --> 30:36.410
In other words,
his colleague's death...

30:36.569 --> 30:40.380
became a symbol
that reminded him of his failure.

30:42.349 --> 30:43.950
How is his treatment coming?

30:44.950 --> 30:46.519
It's not coming easily.

30:46.750 --> 30:48.650
His defensive mechanism is too strong.

30:49.220 --> 30:51.390
Actually, he is rejecting the treatment.

30:52.289 --> 30:54.789
Did you know he was suffering from PTSD?

30:54.960 --> 30:57.160
And that he was taking medication?

30:57.230 --> 30:59.559
Yes, I do.

30:59.559 --> 31:03.400
He was taking anti-depressants
and painkillers in excess amounts.

31:04.569 --> 31:07.940
I didn't report it due to your request.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.309
I'm in debt to you.

31:10.470 --> 31:14.740
They wouldn't have freely
talked about it...

31:15.849 --> 31:17.980
if they knew the current state
of our elite agent was in.

31:18.819 --> 31:20.180
If that were the case,

31:20.380 --> 31:22.319
they would have resigned.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.089
So I want to ask a favor.

31:26.859 --> 31:28.359
Discharge him for now.

31:28.690 --> 31:30.390
No, that can never happen.

31:31.029 --> 31:33.230
He may look calm on the outside.

31:33.230 --> 31:35.099
But he's like a time bomb.

31:35.529 --> 31:37.369
People from higher up
have already decided.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.700
There's nothing I can do about it.
Now if you'll excuse me.

31:41.869 --> 31:44.170
By the way, did you read the report?

31:45.279 --> 31:46.740
His blood test result says...

31:46.740 --> 31:48.980
there's amphetamine
and opioid in his blood.

31:49.109 --> 31:50.210
And?

31:50.380 --> 31:51.710
Coincidentally, those two substances...

31:51.849 --> 31:54.750
have similar effects
to the anti-depressants and painkillers...

31:54.750 --> 31:56.549
he has been taking.

31:56.950 --> 31:59.490
Do you mean as a substitute?

31:59.819 --> 32:02.859
That would be most likely...

32:03.460 --> 32:06.200
if he wasn't able to get it
prescribed to him.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.299
Did you put that in the report?

32:10.569 --> 32:12.500
No, I wanted to tell you first.

32:12.740 --> 32:13.940
Here's what I want you to do.

32:14.140 --> 32:16.369
Let's keep this between us.

32:16.710 --> 32:19.140
I'll find the right moment
to report it to my superior.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.289
(Discharge Order, Han Ji Hyuk)

34:14.820 --> 34:17.429
(M-Mart,
Shop conveniently at M-Mart!)

34:21.800 --> 34:23.099
(M-Mart,
Shop conveniently at M-Mart!)

35:34.400 --> 35:36.510
What happened to me?

36:01.929 --> 36:03.099
Answer me.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.400
What happened to you?

37:49.739 --> 37:51.639
(Seo Su Yeon)

38:00.480 --> 38:05.219
(Seo Su Yeon)

38:31.210 --> 38:34.380
How do you feel to fall
into the bottomless pit?

38:35.050 --> 38:38.650
I heard what kind of conditions you got.

38:40.889 --> 38:42.059
I didn't know.

38:43.590 --> 38:46.360
That's why I thought of
a million questions to ask you.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.670
But I guess it's all for nothing.

38:52.230 --> 38:53.239
You...

38:54.000 --> 38:56.309
never accepted us
as your colleagues.

38:57.409 --> 38:58.510
Not even once.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.210
You didn't care about the others.

39:03.380 --> 39:05.510
You only focused on your missions.

39:07.050 --> 39:08.519
To you,

39:09.719 --> 39:11.920
we didn't mean a thing.

39:16.030 --> 39:17.030
Once...

39:19.030 --> 39:20.360
I asked you a favor.

39:22.030 --> 39:23.070
Do you remember?

39:26.670 --> 39:28.699
Don't tell me you forgot that too.

39:39.449 --> 39:41.179
Let me make the drink for you.

39:41.420 --> 39:43.750
- Pour just a little.
- Just a little for me too.

39:43.750 --> 39:46.260
- That's enough.
- I'll just go with beer.

39:47.389 --> 39:49.860
This is considered a superfood.
It's good for your skin.

39:50.059 --> 39:51.889
- Goodness.
- Lots of them suffer.

39:52.260 --> 39:54.559
They have to put
their lives out in danger.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.730
Thanks.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.570
Please let me have one too.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.289
What is it?

40:18.289 --> 40:19.789
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

40:33.199 --> 40:34.469
What brings you here?

40:37.840 --> 40:38.869
May I...

40:40.480 --> 40:42.079
ask you for a favor?

40:43.150 --> 40:45.449
You don't have to worry.
I didn't see anything.

40:45.449 --> 40:46.480
No.

40:47.949 --> 40:49.190
Not that.

40:53.989 --> 40:55.889
I have a bad feeling...

40:57.360 --> 40:59.030
about this project.

40:59.699 --> 41:00.860
And?

41:01.099 --> 41:02.730
Please promise me something.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.570
That you won't do anything rash
just as you did before.

41:08.539 --> 41:10.110
That no matter what happens,

41:10.969 --> 41:13.679
you'll consider the safety
of your colleagues as your priority.

41:14.809 --> 41:17.480
Are you asking me
as your colleague, or...

41:17.480 --> 41:19.750
I know what you mean.

41:22.989 --> 41:24.190
And it's both.

41:25.889 --> 41:27.789
So promise me...

41:27.920 --> 41:31.760
that you won't forget
what I just asked you.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.539
After that incident,

41:43.110 --> 41:45.539
I had to go check
Kyung Seok's body...

41:46.110 --> 41:47.780
when it came through the consulate.

41:49.510 --> 41:52.010
His face was crushed so badly...

41:53.320 --> 41:54.679
that I couldn't recognize him...

41:55.889 --> 41:57.489
no matter how hard I tried.

42:03.230 --> 42:05.559
You should've seen it yourself.

42:06.929 --> 42:08.460
If you did,

42:09.530 --> 42:11.269
then even someone like you...

42:12.170 --> 42:14.070
couldn't have
forgotten that for life.

42:20.739 --> 42:22.039
Make sure you remember.

42:23.179 --> 42:25.510
Do whatever it takes to remember...

42:26.119 --> 42:27.849
who did that to him,

42:27.849 --> 42:29.920
what the situation was like,

42:30.050 --> 42:33.460
and how he looked as he passed.

42:35.059 --> 42:36.960
You need to tell me everything...

42:37.860 --> 42:38.989
without leaving out any details.

42:42.130 --> 42:44.269
You're the most amazing guy
in this world.

42:45.429 --> 42:47.039
So this time,

42:47.670 --> 42:49.369
try to save yourself.

42:51.440 --> 42:53.280
Climb up from that pit...

42:54.280 --> 42:56.179
with your own power.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.789
Are you sure these feelings are
solely caused by Kyung Seok?

43:09.460 --> 43:11.159
Because I don't really get it.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.800
There were three people
on the field that day, including me.

43:16.199 --> 43:19.130
You and Chief Ha were
waiting in the headquarters.

43:20.269 --> 43:21.900
In that situation,
we were cut off from contact,

43:21.900 --> 43:24.940
then found on a ship
300km away from the shore.

43:26.710 --> 43:29.239
I really don't understand.

43:33.679 --> 43:36.550
Did you really fail to receive
any contact from us?

43:47.230 --> 43:48.599
That's it?

43:50.929 --> 43:52.769
The only thing you can say to me...

43:54.300 --> 43:56.010
in this situation...

43:57.139 --> 43:58.670
is that?

44:01.139 --> 44:02.510
You still have no idea...

44:04.079 --> 44:05.980
what the problem is.

45:24.260 --> 45:25.690
So this time,

45:26.659 --> 45:28.130
try to save yourself.

45:29.099 --> 45:30.699
Climb up from that pit...

45:31.900 --> 45:33.469
with your own power.

45:33.969 --> 45:36.070
You're the most amazing guy
in this world.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.230
There's no sign of resistance.

46:02.059 --> 46:04.099
He was caught off guard,

46:04.630 --> 46:07.099
without getting a chance
to fight back.

46:11.309 --> 46:13.309
Three shots
in the chest and abdomen.

46:16.150 --> 46:17.980
Two shots in the left head.

46:19.150 --> 46:20.219
And...

46:46.340 --> 46:47.880
I must find out...

46:50.909 --> 46:52.650
who it was.

48:34.619 --> 48:36.449
- Incheon Airport, please.
- Yes, sir.

48:47.500 --> 48:49.630
Plates 95S 9548.

48:57.670 --> 49:00.309
Yes, it looks like
he's headed for the airport.

49:01.809 --> 49:03.610
He's on the phone.

49:04.010 --> 49:05.980
Yes, sir. I'll tail him.

49:27.940 --> 49:29.199
(Han Ji Hyuk, Online)

49:44.289 --> 49:46.389
I don't have to tell you
who he is, do I?

49:46.460 --> 49:47.989
Do not let your guard down.

50:06.110 --> 50:07.639
Where's the man
that got in your taxi?

50:07.639 --> 50:09.809
He got off in the middle.

50:09.809 --> 50:11.650
He told me to keep driving this way,

50:12.610 --> 50:14.349
then gave me this much money.

50:22.590 --> 50:24.530
(Incheon Port Authority)

50:31.329 --> 50:32.400
Officer Kim.

50:44.010 --> 50:45.210
Excuse me.

50:49.019 --> 50:50.989
Can you show me your ID?

50:50.989 --> 50:53.050
(Coast Guard)

51:09.469 --> 51:10.940
Gosh. No way.

51:11.440 --> 51:13.380
That was so cool. Nice.

51:17.750 --> 51:19.780
Hello, how can I help you?

52:27.280 --> 52:28.320
Thank you.

52:30.019 --> 52:31.219
Han Ji Hyuk?

52:31.690 --> 52:32.690
Yes.

52:34.019 --> 52:36.530
You have the highest grades here.

52:36.630 --> 52:39.429
But you bombed the evaluations
from your drill sergeants...

52:40.130 --> 52:41.300
and peers.

52:42.460 --> 52:45.230
"He doesn't care about anyone else.
He's very stubborn."

52:45.230 --> 52:47.300
"He's extreme and reckless."

52:56.010 --> 52:57.550
Forget about them.

52:59.809 --> 53:02.519
This place is full of stupid fools
who care about their reputations...

53:02.780 --> 53:05.519
and are good at making connections.

53:06.090 --> 53:08.289
And they have forgotten
the essence of this place.

53:09.989 --> 53:11.960
What this place is all about.

53:13.500 --> 53:14.900
In our line of work,

53:14.900 --> 53:17.829
there's a place
ordinary people can never reach.

53:18.230 --> 53:20.739
Good and evil. Ethics and morals.

53:20.840 --> 53:22.139
Knowledge and ideology.

53:23.170 --> 53:25.440
You can go beyond these limitations.

53:34.280 --> 53:35.280
So...

53:36.519 --> 53:38.750
don't let these fools
have any sway over you.

53:40.989 --> 53:44.059
You are good enough as you are now.

53:52.800 --> 53:55.869
Oh, my. You haven't changed...

53:56.000 --> 53:57.940
seeing how you ditched the guys
and got this far.

54:03.409 --> 54:05.449
You know, it's been a while.

54:05.849 --> 54:08.449
Shouldn't you at least pretend
that you're happy to see me?

54:09.449 --> 54:11.650
Why did you come
all the way here yourself?

54:13.989 --> 54:15.590
Come on. You're so stiff.

54:18.489 --> 54:22.900
Well, we discussed internally
what to do with you.

54:24.530 --> 54:27.670
Your doctors said
that you needed to rest a bit more.

54:28.139 --> 54:31.440
So you'll be helping out the team
in the outskirts for now.

54:38.980 --> 54:40.019
Open it.

54:51.130 --> 54:53.360
We retrieved it
at the scene where you went missing.

54:53.530 --> 54:55.260
I had been keeping it personally.

55:01.340 --> 55:02.369
Want to die?

55:03.070 --> 55:04.070
What about you?

55:10.449 --> 55:13.079
I understand
what you must be going through.

55:13.480 --> 55:15.519
But you must know
that we did what we could.

55:17.590 --> 55:18.849
It's been a year.

55:19.690 --> 55:21.690
What do you think
you could do there all by yourself?

55:27.300 --> 55:29.130
Don't fixate
on finding your answer outside.

55:29.800 --> 55:30.800
Perhaps,

55:31.369 --> 55:34.869
you might be able to find it,
somewhere close and unexpected.

55:38.739 --> 55:41.139
Ji Hyuk, don't rush this.

55:42.409 --> 55:44.780
Let nature take its course.

55:49.780 --> 55:51.590
Please make me one promise.

55:52.320 --> 55:55.289
Once I do everything
you tell me to do, please let me...

55:56.360 --> 55:58.329
investigate the incident myself.

56:02.500 --> 56:03.500
Sure.

56:04.300 --> 56:06.630
I'll talk to the deputy commissioner
about that.

56:16.980 --> 56:18.179
Oh, this?

56:18.780 --> 56:19.909
It's nothing.

56:21.079 --> 56:22.750
An occupational hazard.

56:26.050 --> 56:28.820
May I leave first
if you are done speaking?

56:31.860 --> 56:34.900
Assign him to the information center
when you get back.

56:35.030 --> 56:36.659
There's a friend there I know.

56:36.659 --> 56:37.699
Yes, sir.

56:39.829 --> 56:43.300
I checked if Han Ji Hyuk
had any ticketing records.

56:43.710 --> 56:45.239
But...

56:45.610 --> 56:46.909
there was nothing.

56:47.679 --> 56:49.139
What do you mean?

56:49.480 --> 56:51.380
I mean, he didn't purchase any tickets.

56:55.019 --> 56:56.050
By the way,

56:56.650 --> 57:00.460
the people you put on my tail
during the past few days...

57:00.760 --> 57:02.360
Please, pull them back.

57:03.389 --> 57:04.860
That's what I can here to say.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.230
Okay. Good job.

57:13.570 --> 57:14.599
Bye.

and Bring Glory to Korea)

58:49.059 --> 58:50.530
As you know,

58:50.969 --> 58:53.030
our organization is
putting fewer people...

58:53.030 --> 58:54.670
on anti-communist projects.

58:56.099 --> 58:58.210
This is how things are changing.
Who can we blame?

58:58.210 --> 59:00.010
But we still have to show results.

59:00.610 --> 59:03.909
So we established another team
to deal with these changes.

59:05.610 --> 59:08.079
It's called
the Crime Information Center.

59:08.179 --> 59:10.289
Well, it's a fancy name.

59:11.190 --> 59:13.320
We just combined our
narcotics, counterterrorism,

59:13.320 --> 59:15.360
and cybercrimes teams...

59:15.360 --> 59:17.730
and gave it a new name.

59:18.489 --> 59:22.099
And you'll be joining
the support team for the center.

59:22.400 --> 59:24.400
Whenever they need help,

59:25.199 --> 59:27.539
you can just join them
and help them out.

59:29.139 --> 59:31.369
Don't look down on it
because it sounds unimportant.

59:31.369 --> 59:32.840

you're ready. I give you my word.

59:52.030 --> 59:53.090
I bought it...

1:00:46.650 --> 1:00:48.949
Come on.
He's so much younger than me.

1:00:49.750 --> 1:00:51.789
Look at that rude jerk.

1:00:51.889 --> 1:00:55.159
Saying hello is a polite thing
to do when you meet new people.

1:00:55.159 --> 1:00:56.659
He's handsome, though.

1:00:56.820 --> 1:00:58.130
What? You think so?

1:00:58.630 --> 1:00:59.989
Come on.

1:01:00.530 --> 1:01:02.199
She graduated from KAIST
with a degree in chemistry.

1:01:02.199 --> 1:01:04.099
She joined our organization
at 21 with early graduation.

1:01:04.199 --> 1:01:05.199
For the past seven years,

1:01:05.199 --> 1:01:06.929
she has mainly worked in
data processing teams.

1:01:07.269 --> 1:01:08.670
She not only received high evaluations
regarding her work,

1:01:08.670 --> 1:01:11.639
but her peer evaluations
were also top-notch.

1:01:12.909 --> 1:01:15.039
- Who is it?
- Sorry?

1:01:16.409 --> 1:01:19.409
As you're aware,
she's the only one who applied.

1:01:19.409 --> 1:01:20.650
No, I mean...

1:01:21.250 --> 1:01:23.579
Why did she apply with
that kind of background?

1:01:23.579 --> 1:01:25.619
It's an insignificant
field support team.

1:01:25.690 --> 1:01:29.460
It's not common for someone at
the desk to apply for a field job.

1:01:29.590 --> 1:01:31.460
Considering how the higher-ups
signed off on it right away,

1:01:31.460 --> 1:01:33.030
there must be a reason.

1:01:33.030 --> 1:01:35.730
Plus, she'll be working with
Han Ji Hyuk as his partner.

1:01:37.329 --> 1:01:38.630

1:01:38.630 --> 1:01:41.340

- Yes, sir.

is someone you know very well.

out of concern for you.

just keep your head down.

1:03:52.030 --> 1:03:53.099
Yes.

1:03:53.099 --> 1:03:55.239
Relationships between people
are quite interesting.

1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:57.369
It's incredible how you came back
from the dead,

1:03:57.369 --> 1:04:00.239
but who knew we'd end up like this?

1:04:01.079 --> 1:04:02.980
After what happened a year ago,

1:04:02.980 --> 1:04:05.210
the entire division
got turned upside down,

1:04:05.210 --> 1:04:07.280
and when I watched
our team fall apart,

1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:09.519
I thought that everything was over.

1:04:09.519 --> 1:04:11.289
But there's always a light
at the end of the tunnel.

1:04:11.289 --> 1:04:12.820
After I came here,

1:04:13.119 --> 1:04:15.260
my performance records
have been pretty good too.

1:04:15.789 --> 1:04:18.260
I think I'm finally settled in.

1:04:20.489 --> 1:04:22.230
I heard the basic gist
of everything.

1:04:23.230 --> 1:04:25.869
That you've lost your memory.

1:04:26.670 --> 1:04:29.800
I had a feeling that
something was off...

1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:31.739
when I saw you there.

1:04:33.570 --> 1:04:36.409
Right. I'm sure you're sick
and tired of talking about this,

1:04:36.409 --> 1:04:38.480
so we can always talk about it
later on.

What do you want to know?

1:04:42.849 --> 1:04:45.949
It's okay. You can ask me anything.

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:54.130
Did you really...

1:04:54.730 --> 1:04:57.369
lose all of your memories
from the past year?

1:04:58.130 --> 1:05:01.170
You don't remember a single thing?
Not even one bit?

1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:03.699
Yes, sir. I don't remember
a single thing...

1:05:03.699 --> 1:05:05.869
from the moment we lost contact
in Dandong until now.

1:05:05.869 --> 1:05:08.639
Then what about everything
before then.

1:05:10.239 --> 1:05:11.949
Why do you want to know about that?

1:05:15.679 --> 1:05:17.989
Luckily, everything before then
is clear in my mind.

1:05:17.989 --> 1:05:20.349
Especially everything that
happened with you, sir.

1:05:22.619 --> 1:05:25.960

like me to recite every I remember?

1:05:27.860 --> 1:05:29.699
I see your personality
is still the same.

You'll be surprised when
you see her. She's changed a lot.

1:05:48.579 --> 1:05:51.690
Do you know where she went
after our team broke up?

1:05:51.820 --> 1:05:52.889
She went to the domestic part.

1:05:57.159 --> 1:05:58.590
Isn't that hilarious?

She acted like she cared so much
about her colleagues,

1:06:01.400 --> 1:06:04.000
but after the incident happened,
she changed face...

1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:05.500
and went there.

1:06:29.820 --> 1:06:31.289
I'm sorry, sir.

1:06:31.289 --> 1:06:33.659
I wasn't able to check my phone
as I was at lunch.

1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:37.159
Say hello. This is your partner.

1:06:41.539 --> 1:06:44.340
Hello, sir. My name is Yoo Je Yi.

1:06:54.650 --> 1:06:57.019
Okay, everyone. Pay attention!

1:06:59.420 --> 1:07:01.389
I'm sure you guys are all aware,

1:07:01.519 --> 1:07:04.690
but your colleague
has returned home safely.

1:07:04.690 --> 1:07:07.260
Let's give your colleague, who has
miraculously returned from the dead,

1:07:07.260 --> 1:07:09.500
a warm round of applause
to welcome him back.

1:07:16.840 --> 1:07:17.940
The end.

1:07:31.190 --> 1:07:34.389
Sir. It's an honor to work with you.

1:07:35.719 --> 1:07:38.630
To be honest, I applied to come here
because of you.

1:07:42.500 --> 1:07:43.800
Sir?

1:07:44.730 --> 1:07:47.130
It's our first day as partners,

1:07:47.230 --> 1:07:49.199
so if you have time,
would you like to eat...

1:07:49.199 --> 1:07:51.670
No, I mean...
Would you like to get some coffee?

1:07:52.909 --> 1:07:55.340
- Didn't you hear?
- Pardon?

1:07:57.280 --> 1:08:00.179
- I asked if you didn't hear.
- Hear about what?

1:08:00.179 --> 1:08:01.949
My partners died.

1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:05.550
A year ago. Both of them.

1:08:06.090 --> 1:08:07.860
No, I didn't... Sir...

1:09:04.310 --> 1:09:07.380
M... M. A. R...

1:09:09.819 --> 1:09:11.590
M. M. A. R...

1:09:15.189 --> 1:09:17.659
MMART 082581.

1:09:24.930 --> 1:09:27.000
(M-Mart,

1:09:34.479 --> 1:09:36.109
MMART.

1:09:36.109 --> 1:09:37.180
(M-Mart,

1:09:37.180 --> 1:09:39.409

1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.039
(Flash Drive D)

1:12:35.819 --> 1:12:38.430
Listen up to what I'm about to say.

1:12:38.430 --> 1:12:40.359
You'll only get one chance.

1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:45.100
There's a rat in our agency.

1:12:46.369 --> 1:12:48.340
And I deleted...

1:12:50.439 --> 1:12:51.739
my own memories...

1:12:53.170 --> 1:12:54.739
to find the traitor.

1:13:15.500 --> 1:13:18.470
(The Veil)

1:13:48.729 --> 1:13:51.699
You must be suspicious
of every move, word,

1:13:51.699 --> 1:13:54.300
and breath from
everyone who approaches you.

1:13:54.329 --> 1:13:56.899
Don't forget the warning I gave you.

1:13:56.939 --> 1:13:59.869
These are the people
Ji Won was after a year ago.

1:13:59.970 --> 1:14:02.109
I'd like to question him myself.
Please let me see him.

1:14:02.109 --> 1:14:05.149
I looked everywhere for you,
Han Ji Hyuk.

1:14:05.550 --> 1:14:06.880
Ji Hyuk, are you insane?

1:14:06.880 --> 1:14:08.050
What are you doing?

1:14:08.050 --> 1:14:10.880
You're dead now.

1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:13.520
You must find that traitor.

1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:14.520
Yes.

1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:16.960
It was him.
