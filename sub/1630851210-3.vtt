WEBVTT

00:15.360 --> 00:16.840
That was delicious, Cynthia.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.800
Why don't we, uh, skip pudding, eh?

00:31.120 --> 00:32.560
Oh yeah, baby!

00:32.640 --> 00:34.040
Oh! So good!

00:34.120 --> 00:36.400
-Yeah!

00:36.920 --> 00:38.360
That's it, baby!

00:38.440 --> 00:41.200
Oh! Yes, yes, yes, yes! Oh yes!

00:43.960 --> 00:46.800
Oh! Yes!

00:47.320 --> 00:49.480
Oh, Jeffrey!

00:49.560 --> 00:51.960
-Ooh! That's your monkey, Jeffrey!

00:52.560 --> 00:53.840
-Yes, it is!

00:54.440 --> 00:55.720
Oh yes!

01:07.000 --> 01:08.360
Oh!

01:08.440 --> 01:11.080
-Jonathan!

01:11.160 --> 01:12.880
-He might be all right.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.680
-Oh!

01:29.120 --> 01:30.080
Vile.

01:33.280 --> 01:35.120
Bam! Bam!

02:27.440 --> 02:30.760
Hi! Uh, Ola, is this my Titanic record?

02:30.840 --> 02:31.760
Yeah, it's great!

02:31.840 --> 02:35.640
Yeah. Well, the thing is,
some of my records are quite rare.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.720
-I like to keep them in their place.
-Dad, where's my biology book?

02:38.800 --> 02:40.160
How would I know?

02:40.240 --> 02:41.480
What were you saying?

02:41.560 --> 02:44.360
Well, I was wondering
whether maybe you could ask

02:44.440 --> 02:45.760
before taking my stuff.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.440
Where's my toothbrush?

02:47.520 --> 02:50.080
In your washbag!
Yeah, yeah. I'll ask you next time.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.280
Okay, this is scratched!
This is scratched!

02:53.360 --> 02:55.400
-No!
-Ola, this is a limited edition!

02:55.480 --> 02:57.360
Oh my gosh! Calm down!

02:57.440 --> 02:59.200
-Fuck me!

03:02.760 --> 03:05.360
I'm dropping Goat off
at my auntie's after this.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.760
It's not a problem, Aimee.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.360
And I want you to know
that this is a safe space

03:09.440 --> 03:10.440
for you to share,

03:10.960 --> 03:13.880
and we can go as slowly as you want us to.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.800
I told you. In your washbag!

03:15.880 --> 03:17.800
Will you excuse me just one minute?

03:19.240 --> 03:20.200
-Um…

03:20.280 --> 03:21.280
It's okay.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.120
It comes with a sleeve.
A cover and a sleeve. There it is!

03:24.200 --> 03:26.000
-Give it to me. Fuck!
-I'm doing it.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.600
You don't take care of anything!

03:27.680 --> 03:30.120
There's dust. You don't have
a case for the record player.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.240
Ola!
Why do you need five shampoos?

03:32.320 --> 03:34.080
-It's in here!
-What's the big deal?

03:34.160 --> 03:36.360
You took my property without asking!

03:36.440 --> 03:39.320
-You're so anally retentive!
-And you don't understand boundaries!

03:39.400 --> 03:42.080
-She's taken the Titanic without asking!
-He's being over the top--

03:42.160 --> 03:43.680
And I'm sure you can both work it out

03:43.760 --> 03:47.240
like the responsible young adults
that you apparently are!

03:47.320 --> 03:48.240
Quietly!

03:50.560 --> 03:51.400
Get out!

03:51.480 --> 03:55.240
-Jakob, I have a client downstairs!

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Found it.

03:57.800 --> 04:02.720
Can everyone please keep it quiet
while I'm working?

04:02.800 --> 04:04.360
It's too loud!

04:04.440 --> 04:05.720
Ooh, ooh.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.680
Um, my vagina doesn't look like this.

04:15.760 --> 04:18.240
One of my lip bits
is longer than the other.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.360
Well, it's just an educational model.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.840
The external part is called the vulva,

04:28.600 --> 04:32.120
and the lip bits you're talking about
are called the labia,

04:32.200 --> 04:35.120
and they come in all different shapes,
sizes, and colors.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.360
There's a fascinating website
I could direct you to

04:38.440 --> 04:42.280
that highlights the wide variety
of different vulvas if you're interested?

04:42.360 --> 04:43.640
-Yeah.
-Great.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.280
Do you want to have a seat again?

04:51.720 --> 04:53.440
Let's try that again.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.880
Do you feel comfortable telling me
a little bit about why you're here?

04:59.160 --> 05:01.600
Last term, I was sexually assaulted.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.880
And I thought that I was getting over it,

05:05.520 --> 05:07.280
but I don't think I am.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.200
I used to like my body,
and I used to like having sex,

05:11.280 --> 05:14.720
but ever since it happened,
I don't like the way my body feels.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.680
I don't like looking at it.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.520
I don't like
my boyfriend touching it anymore.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.520
That must be difficult for you, Aimee.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.520
Do you think you could tell me
a little bit more about the assault?

05:30.200 --> 05:31.560
I was going to school,

05:32.600 --> 05:35.160
and everything felt normal.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.720
And then

05:39.280 --> 05:40.600
I got on the bus…

05:41.760 --> 05:43.680
and there was this

05:45.200 --> 05:46.160
man.

05:50.240 --> 05:54.080
Sorry, I just find it hard
to talk about it sometimes.

05:54.160 --> 05:58.160
It's okay. We don't have to talk
about anything you don't want to.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.080
I just wanna be the old me again.

06:00.160 --> 06:03.120
Well, you may never be the old you, Aimee,

06:04.040 --> 06:04.880
but that's okay.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.840
As human beings,
we are constantly changing and developing.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.480
And by processing this trauma,

06:12.560 --> 06:15.080
you may gain clarity on the event itself,

06:15.160 --> 06:17.160
and we can move you towards

06:17.240 --> 06:19.920
healing the relationship
with your body again.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.680
Would you like that?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.200
Yeah, I'd like that.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.640
Fuck.

06:32.680 --> 06:33.720
Sorry.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.360
-Why doesn't she ring the doorbell?
-Why don't you mind your own business?

06:51.440 --> 06:54.520
-Otis, what's wrong with your tie?
-What is wrong with it?

06:54.600 --> 06:55.760
Let me help you.

06:57.960 --> 06:58.960
Hey.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.800
-Good morning.
-Morning.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.920
Otis, do you think
Ruby could give Ola a ride to school too?

07:07.000 --> 07:10.440
I'm not cool enough to be hanging around
with the Untouchable King and Queen.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.640
Well, I hope that's not true, Otis.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.160
I'm meeting Lily anyway.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.640
I was thinking
we could all hang out later, together?

07:18.720 --> 07:21.000
-I've got a date. I can't.
-I'm busy too.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.840
I just want them to get along.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.920
I know. They will, eventually.

07:32.000 --> 07:32.960
Smoothie?

07:34.160 --> 07:35.000
Yeah?

07:35.520 --> 07:37.680
-Mm-hmm.
-Cool.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.320
Yes, Jeffrey, yes!

08:20.880 --> 08:22.960
Harder, harder!

08:23.800 --> 08:25.800
-Just went to get some milk.
-Didn't ask.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.840
Yes, Jeffrey, you sex god!

08:29.920 --> 08:32.400
There are many ways
that I would describe Jeffrey,

08:32.480 --> 08:34.760
but "sex god" is not one of them.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.600
-Jeffrey.
-I'm going to school.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.440
Come back to bed, lover.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.600
I can't have sex again.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.920
You have no idea
how annoying Otis is.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.640
It's like he's never shared a space
with anyone before.

08:53.720 --> 08:57.520
And they do things so differently there.
Everything. Everything is so controlled.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
This is it!

09:01.560 --> 09:02.640
Where'd it go?

09:03.160 --> 09:04.800
It… it was here, I swear.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.800
Maybe someone did it as a hoax.

09:14.600 --> 09:15.480
Good morning, Hope.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.720
I've had ideas about how I can use my time
as head girl in the most productive way.

09:18.800 --> 09:19.680
-Cool, hit me.
-Great.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.920
I wanna create
a Moordale newsletter run by students.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.400
I've been researching
how we can make the campus more green

09:24.480 --> 09:26.360
by using solar panels and tree planting.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.720
I wanna set up
an environmental student board on campus.

09:28.800 --> 09:32.080
I read a study that said yoga
during break time creates more efficiency,

09:32.160 --> 09:34.560
so free yoga classes
alongside food-education classes.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.400
-And I think--
-That is fantastic.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.960
I want to set up a meeting
to talk it through properly.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.880
In the meantime, I need you to make sure

09:40.960 --> 09:43.280
all your peers are wearing
their uniforms correctly.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.600
Absolutely, will do.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.840
Okay. Any problems, you send them to me.

09:50.960 --> 09:51.880
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.040
Hey, Jackson.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.440
Whoa, whoa! Fuck.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.840
Falling at my feet now?

10:05.240 --> 10:07.600
Man, you look kind of screwed, dude.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.120
Yeah, um…

10:10.080 --> 10:12.480
Everything got
really fuzzy for a second.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.960
Did you forget to eat breakfast?

10:15.480 --> 10:16.720
Breakfast is my favorite food.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.800
Okay, but is breakfast a food or a meal?

10:22.880 --> 10:23.800
Thanks.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.480
Every time I see you,
I feel like I've known you for ages.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.360
I think that's the dizzy spell talking.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.600
Come on, up you get.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.080
Hi! Sorry. You're in the wrong uniform.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.320
What is wrong about it?

10:44.400 --> 10:46.920
It's the boys' uniform.
It's way too big for you.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.800
-I think it's a comfortable fit.
-I'm following new guidelines.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.120
-You can let this one slide.
-Sorry, I can't.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.760
-You'll have to talk to Hope about it.
-Oh! Well, that'll be fun.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.600
Why did you do that?

11:00.680 --> 11:02.800
I'm not gonna disobey rules
because you have a crush.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.120
I don't have a crush.
That's not the point.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.960
Unlike you,
I'm taking head girl seriously.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.640
You can be so cutthroat sometimes, Viv.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.960
I do not do fake wool.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.240
This blazer is itchy as fuck.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.360
At least we look better in them
than everyone else.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.160
-Yeah.
-She didn't mean you.

11:24.240 --> 11:26.360
-Hi, Ruby.
-Hey.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.360
Gray is not my color.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.200
Come on. It's not that bad.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.480
I kinda like it.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.400
OT!

11:37.640 --> 11:39.520
-Um, yeah.
-See you.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.600
Okay, um, I'm going to need you
to make an effort tonight.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.800
-Okay.
-I need you to talk, open up a bit.

11:48.880 --> 11:50.040
Okay, I understand.

11:50.640 --> 11:51.480
Cool.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.560
Hi, Rahim.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.400
I would like my books back.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.240
Pablo Neruda, Maya Angelou.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.840
Sure, I'll bring them in for you.

12:02.920 --> 12:06.360
I'd also like you to return
the poems I wrote for you,

12:06.440 --> 12:08.200
that is, if you haven't destroyed them.

12:08.280 --> 12:12.120
I still have the poems, yes.

12:12.920 --> 12:16.360
I burnt everything you ever gave me
in a small, controlled fire, so…

12:16.440 --> 12:19.360
Okay, I will get you your poems.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.240
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Thank you.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.880
-You have confiture on your tie.
-Hm?

12:30.960 --> 12:32.760
Hi. How was therapy?

12:32.840 --> 12:33.840
Oh, it was amazing!

12:33.920 --> 12:36.960
Do you know most women's vulvas
don't look like they do on PornHub?

12:37.040 --> 12:39.520
I thought mine was a bit ugly
because it's not all tucked in,

12:39.600 --> 12:40.800
but it's dead normal.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.280
You should read Come As You Are
by Emily Nagoski. It's a great book.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.080
-I'll lend it to you.
-Okay.

12:49.840 --> 12:50.800
You look nice, babe.

12:52.600 --> 12:56.160
Is everything okay? I feel like
we barely see each other at the moment.

12:56.240 --> 13:00.000
Aw, everything's fine.
Just really busy with my baking.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.000
Good morning, Moordale.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.120
Don't you all look smart?

13:11.280 --> 13:14.240
I know this probably feels
like a big change,

13:14.320 --> 13:18.560
but you'll find that having a uniform
creates a sense of unity

13:18.640 --> 13:19.880
and equilibrium.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.760
And speaking of changes,

13:21.840 --> 13:24.680
the choir will now sing
the new school anthem,

13:24.760 --> 13:26.400
"Non Sibi, sed Toti."

13:30.280 --> 13:31.840
-Shh.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.160
Why are they singing in elf language?

13:55.240 --> 13:56.520
I think it's Latin.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.560
-Well, what does it mean?
-"Not for oneself, but for all."

14:13.960 --> 14:16.120
-Do you wanna hang out later?
-Yeah. I've got--

14:16.200 --> 14:18.440
I need to see you both
in my office, please.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.640
-Oh, Maeve?
-Yeah?

14:20.720 --> 14:21.720
Come with me.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.400
Come on in.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.560
Please, sit down.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.960
Iced VoVos, anyone?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.720
My husband made them.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.640
They're biscuits. They won't bite.

14:51.200 --> 14:55.440
-They've told me to come talk to you.
-Yes. Come on in. Shut the door, please.

14:57.080 --> 14:59.280
I know breaking old habits is hard work,

14:59.360 --> 15:03.080
but I want you all following uniform rules
by the end of the week.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.640
Cal, you can go and put these on.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.240
I'm not wearing a skirt.

15:14.360 --> 15:15.200
Fine.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.880
You don't want to wear a skirt,
that's up to you. I'm a feminist.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.880
I understand.
But you will wear a uniform that fits you.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.400
No baggy trousers
hanging around your ankles.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.960
-I actually--
-I think I'm being more than fair.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.000
Lily,

15:29.760 --> 15:31.560
your hair and makeup is fun,

15:31.640 --> 15:33.440
but it's not appropriate for school.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.480
Maeve, this isn't a campus
for Cookie Monsters.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.240
-Are you referring to my hair?
-I am.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.560
Ola, only school badges allowed,
I'm afraid.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.840
It's my LGBTQIA+ badge.
It's important to me.

15:46.920 --> 15:50.000
Of course it is, but I hope
that your values aren't so fragile

15:50.080 --> 15:52.680
that a little badge
is all that supports them.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.280
Remove it.

15:54.360 --> 15:57.640
Lily, am I right in thinking
that you wrote the musical last term?

15:58.960 --> 16:00.360
What did your parents think of it?

16:02.200 --> 16:03.280
They didn't really get it.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.280
Hm.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.640
Well, enjoy the VoVos.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.360
Back to class.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.000
Oh, Maeve?

16:16.680 --> 16:18.880
Miss Sands tells me
you're interested in applying

16:18.960 --> 16:21.360
for the Gifted & Talented program
in the States.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.280
Uh, no, I can't afford it.

16:23.360 --> 16:27.240
I want opportunities in this school to be
for everyone, no matter their background,

16:27.320 --> 16:29.920
so I'm going to see what I can do
about getting some funding,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.400
so you better get that application in
as soon as you can.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.280
Okay.

16:35.840 --> 16:36.720
I will.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.480
-Thank you.
-Yep.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.520
And I mean it about the hair.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.560
Thank you. Hope will see you now.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.600
-God, what is with that weird crop top?

17:13.320 --> 17:14.360
Shut it!

17:50.760 --> 17:52.360
Maeve's changed the locks.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.280
Yeah, I can see that.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.560
The thing is,
I think I left my passport in there

18:00.640 --> 18:01.960
and it needs renewing.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.760
-Have you got a spare key?
-No, sorry, I don't.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.640
Why don't you come wait inside
until Maeve gets back?

18:11.080 --> 18:14.040
I can offer you a tea,
but you'll have to make it yourself.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.080
-My brother's out.
-It looks just like her, don't it?

18:17.920 --> 18:19.840
How have you done that?

18:21.880 --> 18:23.240
-You never.
-Mm.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.280
Well, you're very talented.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.880
You've even captured her angry eyebrows.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.360
She feels awful.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.760
Talks about it all the time.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.400
She was just worried about Elsie--

18:34.480 --> 18:36.720
Well, it's not really
any of your business, is it?

18:36.800 --> 18:37.760
Sorry.

18:40.760 --> 18:42.520
Would you like me to paint your portrait?

18:42.600 --> 18:45.000
-I couldn't afford anything like that.
-It's fine.

18:45.080 --> 18:49.000
I like to practice,
and I think you got a great face.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.880
I did once get asked to be a hair model.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.120
Just some academy wanting
to experiment on people, but still,

18:55.920 --> 18:57.040
nice to be asked.

18:58.920 --> 18:59.960
Okay, then.

19:01.160 --> 19:02.240
Where'd you want me?

19:02.320 --> 19:05.560
Just in the corner where the light's good,
actually, would be great.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.040
I'm not stripping off!

19:12.720 --> 19:13.720
Maeve?

19:15.080 --> 19:17.080
Did you, uh, did you call me earlier?

19:17.160 --> 19:18.160
Hm?

19:19.040 --> 19:21.160
Oh yeah, I did! But it was an accident.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.200
Oh, okay.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.680
-What do you think of the whole--
-Actually, Otis, I need to talk to you--

19:26.760 --> 19:28.480
What are you doing here, cock biter?

19:28.560 --> 19:30.720
Don't call her that, please.

19:31.680 --> 19:32.960
Your girlfriend's charming.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.640
-What did you wanna talk about?
-Don't worry about it.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.880
-So30 tonight, yeah?
-Yeah.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.400
Well, I was thinking
I could meet you at yours at six,

19:46.480 --> 19:47.680
walk in together?

19:48.280 --> 19:50.640
No, it's fine.
I'll just meet you at the restaurant.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.440
Okay, bye.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.880
But you're still
taking me home now, right?

19:58.800 --> 20:00.720
-Wanna do homework later?
-Not really.

20:01.240 --> 20:04.840
-Why you being so weird?
-Oh, um, because you stole my job, Viv.

20:04.920 --> 20:08.160
I don't understand why you're pretending
you cared about being head boy

20:08.240 --> 20:09.280
when you didn't.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.760
This is an amazing opportunity for me.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.240
Well, I hope it's worth it.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.520
Yo!

20:16.040 --> 20:18.360
-Hey. No more dizzy spells, then?
-No.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.320
You wanna hang out with me?

20:21.080 --> 20:21.960
Yeah.

20:29.840 --> 20:32.360
Your mum doesn't half tell some stories,
doesn't she?

20:32.440 --> 20:35.920
Have you heard the one about
the one-night stand with Steve Guttenberg?

20:40.920 --> 20:42.920
I used to have
a St. Bernard called Kevin.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.600
He did shits the size of a yule log,
but, God, I loved him.

20:45.680 --> 20:49.360
Oh, Kevin.
The only decent man I've ever known.

20:52.280 --> 20:53.400
What's going on?

20:53.920 --> 20:57.200
Isaac, tell Maeve I need to get
my passport from the caravan,

20:57.280 --> 21:01.080
and tell her I'm having my picture done
because you said I had a nice face.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.240
I think she heard you.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.440
We'll be a bit longer, I think,
while the light's good.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.160
Why don't you come
get your passport once you're done?

21:10.240 --> 21:14.040
Isaac, tell Maeve I'll come get
my passport once I'm done here.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.200
-Have you got that?
-Yeah.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.480
-Where are you, Maya Angelou?

22:09.720 --> 22:10.720
Shablam!

22:12.240 --> 22:13.920
Thought you were gonna wear
something smart.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.600
What? My mum washed my jumper.

22:17.320 --> 22:18.960
Remember to ask questions tonight.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.720
You're not scared of heights, are you?

22:26.800 --> 22:27.640
Nah.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.160
-How long are you gonna be?
-I'll just be a minute!

22:51.000 --> 22:52.400
Oh shit!

22:56.240 --> 22:59.400
Excuse me, Jean. I was wondering
whether you had any tampons?

22:59.480 --> 23:02.640
Sorry to be awkward.
I just got my period, and I've run out.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.960
No, it's not awkward at all.
I think I've got some up in my bedroom.

23:06.680 --> 23:10.040
-Your dad has very good taste.
-Those were my mum's, actually.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.440
She loved everything with peonies.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.880
This must be

23:20.480 --> 23:23.840
an especially hard transition
for you, Ola,

23:23.920 --> 23:28.720
and I want you to know that
you can talk to me about it at any time.

23:29.800 --> 23:30.760
Okay.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.200
Did you get pregnant on purpose
to trap my dad?

23:34.280 --> 23:35.480
No!

23:35.560 --> 23:36.600
Of course not.

23:36.680 --> 23:40.360
You really hurt him last time.
He didn't get out of bed for weeks.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.600
He's been through so much.
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

23:45.120 --> 23:48.080
-I really care for your dad.
-Then why did you hurt him before?

23:48.160 --> 23:50.880
Ola, have you used my razor?

23:50.960 --> 23:54.200
-It's blunt and covered in hair.
-Yeah. I couldn't find mine, sorry.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.600
Great.
Guess I have to start labeling my shit.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.640
-Otis, that's very ungenerous of you.
-We're not real siblings, Mum.

24:00.720 --> 24:03.240
It's okay. He's going to have
a real half-sibling soon.

24:03.320 --> 24:05.360
So maybe he'll be less
of an arsehole to them.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.720
Yeah, maybe. I've gotta go.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.640
Tampons?

24:12.040 --> 24:13.480
Yes, right.

24:14.160 --> 24:15.000
Tampons.

24:24.240 --> 24:27.040
What's with your…
…accent?

24:28.400 --> 24:30.920
My family moved here
from Minneapolis two years ago.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.560
-Cool.
-Do you want some?

24:35.120 --> 24:37.560
Nah, I shouldn't.

24:37.640 --> 24:38.560
Thanks though.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.000
Are you religious or something?

24:41.080 --> 24:42.600
No, um,

24:43.920 --> 24:44.840
I used to swim.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.720
I couldn't do that kind of stuff,
so I haven't tried it.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.800
That's okay. You do you.

24:53.520 --> 24:54.920
All right, let me try some.

25:04.560 --> 25:06.760
-Hm.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.440
-Oh, you good?
-I'm good.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.240
Why did you go all woozy today?

25:17.800 --> 25:18.880
It's anxiety.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.200
I've always had it,
but it's been pretty bad recently.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.120
Mm-hmm.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.800
I think now I'm not swimming,
I haven't got a routine.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.040
I get triggered by the most random stuff.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.440
It's okay.
I have anxiety, too, so I get it.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.840
-What was the trigger this time?
-Just school.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.200
I was thinking if I don't swim anymore
and I'm not head boy,

25:38.280 --> 25:40.200
and I'm not very good at acting,

25:40.840 --> 25:42.360
then who the hell am I?

25:43.480 --> 25:45.600
Like, maybe I don't care
about anything enough.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.960
Whoa. You're 17.
You don't have to have it figured out.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.040
This is not the message
the world is giving me.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.400
Maybe try
just being Jackson Marchetti for a bit?

25:56.720 --> 25:58.400
All right, I'll try.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.240
What's Minneapolis like?

26:01.320 --> 26:03.640
Whoa, that feels really weird

26:04.200 --> 26:05.440
coming out of my mouth.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.080
-Minneapolis-ah.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.880
-Pa-la-pa-la-pa.

26:09.960 --> 26:13.160
-Why does that feel so weird?
-I think you're just getting really high.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.600
-Oh, is it?
-It is, yeah.

26:17.880 --> 26:18.880
Pa-la, pa-la!

26:18.960 --> 26:21.400
We getting high in Minneapolis, baby!

26:22.200 --> 26:23.280
Whoo!

26:28.240 --> 26:31.600
Ruby, you have slayed your look!

26:31.680 --> 26:33.600
It smells like canned soup in here.

26:34.440 --> 26:35.400
Hi.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.320
-How are you?
-I'm good. Good look.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.840
-Hi.
-All right?

26:42.840 --> 26:44.360
There's nothing gluten-free.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.360
How long have you been diabetic?

26:49.000 --> 26:50.120
I'm not diabetic.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.320
You can't eat sugar.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.400
Gluten, Adam. Not glucose.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.200
Does anyone else…

27:03.200 --> 27:04.920
like the smell of their own farts?

27:10.240 --> 27:11.960
You told me to ask questions.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.240
A bit nervous. It's hot.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.080
Take your fucking jacket off, then!

27:19.200 --> 27:20.440
Quickly.

27:23.680 --> 27:24.520
Hey!

27:25.040 --> 27:25.880
Hi.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.880
Jean was unpacking my mum's stuff today.

27:34.520 --> 27:35.920
Felt strange.

27:36.600 --> 27:37.840
I miss her so much.

27:37.920 --> 27:42.080
Circletruther3250 thinks it's possible
aliens made the crop circle disappear.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.680
I thought I was imagining it,
but I think the 8th is still gonna happen.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.920
What's the 8th?

27:47.000 --> 27:48.680
All these stars are gonna align,

27:48.760 --> 27:51.440
which will allow one alien mothership
to make it to Earth.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.080
It's gonna change everything.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.320
Okay, cool.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.520
-Guess what?
-What?

27:58.400 --> 28:01.600
I'm ready for you to read my story.
I'll send it to you now.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.120
Okay.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.960
Well, fucking hell!

28:23.320 --> 28:24.320
Oh!

28:25.800 --> 28:26.880
Hello.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.440
Definitely a geranium.

28:43.960 --> 28:44.800
Mmm.

28:46.680 --> 28:47.760
Fucking hell!

28:50.720 --> 28:52.920
So, are you guys excited
about going to France?

28:53.520 --> 28:55.040
Not really, I get coach-sick.

28:55.120 --> 28:59.040
Aw. I wish I could go.
Got to go to a wedding in Nigeria.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.720
Isn't it illegal to be gay in Nigeria?

29:02.800 --> 29:06.080
Yeah, it is,
but no one knows I am there, so…

29:06.160 --> 29:07.680
I didn't know it was illegal.

29:07.760 --> 29:10.760
-Yeah, it's no big deal.
-It sounds like a big deal.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.640
Can we talk about it later?

29:12.720 --> 29:15.400
Adam, how is your dad?

29:17.040 --> 29:19.480
Uh, I don't know.
I haven't seen him for a while.

29:19.560 --> 29:20.840
My parents are separated.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.440
Yeah. Yeah, I heard, sorry.

29:24.320 --> 29:27.640
Well, my mum's having a baby
with Ola's dad, which is kind of weird

29:27.720 --> 29:30.840
because we used to date,
and now we're like actual siblings.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.800
Maybe don't tell people that.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.040
Pretty weird, dude.

29:37.080 --> 29:40.680
How do you feel about it?
New family, baby, and stuff?

29:42.320 --> 29:43.640
It's a big adjustment

29:44.480 --> 29:47.360
'cause I'm an only child,
but I'm trying to be more adult.

29:47.440 --> 29:50.280
Yeah, I think Ola's finding it hard too.

29:50.360 --> 29:53.240
After her mum died
and her sister's gone off to university,

29:53.320 --> 29:55.520
it's just been her and her dad, so…

29:56.040 --> 29:59.200
…maybe you can
help each other out.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.880
-Did I say the wrong thing?
-No.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.080
That was very astute, actually.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.960
-Holy shit!
-What?

30:10.040 --> 30:11.920
Kim Kardashian's having
another surrogate baby.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.520
She is so bold. I can't believe it.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.240
Don't you think it's weird how

30:17.160 --> 30:19.600
the last surrogate was never in the show?

30:23.240 --> 30:24.480
I watch the Kardashians

30:25.560 --> 30:26.440
with my mum.

30:27.680 --> 30:28.800
Well, well, well.

31:00.880 --> 31:01.920
Beautiful.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.760
-Yes, yes. Come on!

31:18.240 --> 31:19.800
-I've done it!
-Come on!

31:23.520 --> 31:25.120
Yes, come on!

31:30.760 --> 31:34.840
So ultimate question,
Khloe, pre or post Revenge Body?

31:34.920 --> 31:35.760
Pre.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.040
I totally agree
because she's more relatable.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.400
-Big-time.
-Yeah.

31:40.240 --> 31:43.200
I think I'm starting to get
the whole Adam thing.

31:43.880 --> 31:46.000
Yeah? He grows on you, doesn't he?

31:47.600 --> 31:49.040
Hello, hello, hello, hi!

31:49.840 --> 31:52.600
That was fun.
Are you guys going back to Ruby's now?

31:52.680 --> 31:54.920
I've never actually been to Ruby's house.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.760
Really? But you guys have been
seeing each other for a while.

31:58.680 --> 32:00.280
Anyway, this was nice.

32:00.360 --> 32:03.840
Adam, text me once you've watched
the Kylie Does New York spin-off, yeah?

32:03.920 --> 32:05.960
-Buh-bye.
-Oh! Oh, uh, bye.

32:06.480 --> 32:07.360
Okay.

32:07.440 --> 32:10.160
I think we were walking
in the same direction, but…

32:10.800 --> 32:11.720
Yeah.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
Ooh!

32:17.680 --> 32:19.440
Oh, do you wanna feel the baby kick?

32:19.520 --> 32:21.640
-Really?
-Yeah, right there.

32:24.720 --> 32:25.560
Oh.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.520
Oh.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.880
It's stopped. It was so strong though.

32:31.960 --> 32:32.840
Oh.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.480
Maybe it's gone back to sleep.

32:35.400 --> 32:36.960
What do you think about Thor?

32:39.320 --> 32:40.160
As what?

32:40.240 --> 32:41.920
A name, if it's a boy.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.560
Why do you laugh?

32:51.800 --> 32:52.800
I don't know.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.440
-Thor?
-Yeah.

32:54.520 --> 32:55.800
-Thor?
-Thor.

32:55.880 --> 32:59.280
That's the name of the superhero
with the pumped-up muscles.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.320
A bit silly, isn't it?

33:01.360 --> 33:02.400
It was my father's name.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.120
It's a very common name in Sweden.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.200
No big deal.

33:10.360 --> 33:11.360
I'm sorry.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.400
Yes, I can think about

33:15.920 --> 33:17.440
Thor, sure.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.760
Thor Nyman.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.840
That's a strong boy's name, huh?

33:23.600 --> 33:25.760
Why does a boy's name need to be strong?

33:26.800 --> 33:29.400
Well, you said yourself,
the kick was strong.

33:29.480 --> 33:33.280
Yes, but the baby can be any sex
and have a strong kick.

33:33.360 --> 33:37.320
And why do you just assume
the baby's going to have your surname?

33:37.400 --> 33:42.040
It ain't gonna be Milburn
'cause that's your ex-husband's name.

33:42.120 --> 33:45.720
No, but it could be my maiden name,
which is Franklin.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.600
You gonna change your name
back to Franklin?

33:47.680 --> 33:49.400
I don't know!

33:49.480 --> 33:51.960
Probably not,
but I haven't thought about it yet.

33:52.040 --> 33:55.920
Well, then it makes more sense
if the baby's a Nyman.

33:56.000 --> 33:59.240
It's easier
to stick to traditions, I think.

34:02.480 --> 34:05.960
I'm actually surprised
that you think like this, Jakob.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.760
It's so old-fashioned.

34:07.840 --> 34:11.520
I mean, next you'll be telling me
that you vote Conservative.

34:11.600 --> 34:12.840
I don't vote.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.440
What do you mean, you don't vote?

34:16.520 --> 34:18.600
-Never have.
-You don't vote?

34:19.560 --> 34:21.680
I think
this would look good in our bedroom.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.360
I think
that would look good back in the box.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.880
You're funny.

34:33.080 --> 34:35.000
I'll be okay from here,

34:35.880 --> 34:36.800
so…

34:38.240 --> 34:40.240
How come
you never invite me to your house?

34:40.760 --> 34:43.640
I don't "never invite" you…

34:48.040 --> 34:50.440
My house is shit, okay?

34:51.080 --> 34:54.920
People assume I live in a big,
fancy house, but I don't, okay?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.800
So I don't invite people over.

34:57.520 --> 34:58.440
Ever?

34:59.080 --> 35:00.720
Not even Olivia and Anwar?

35:05.040 --> 35:07.800
-Well, I'd like to see it.

35:07.880 --> 35:10.040
But I understand
if you don't wanna show me.

35:12.920 --> 35:13.960
Oh, fine!

35:14.520 --> 35:16.280
Would you like to see my house?

35:16.800 --> 35:18.200
Why, yes, I would.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.200
So annoying sometimes, Otis.

35:22.360 --> 35:24.560
I don't think
you should go to Nigeria.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.360
Why?

35:26.920 --> 35:28.600
It's dangerous to be gay there.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.520
It's dangerous to be gay anywhere.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.520
It's a part of me. I wanna go.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.080
It's not as dangerous here.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.960
Adam, stop it, man. You don't understand.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.840
Did Rahim understand?

35:42.880 --> 35:44.240
Why would you say that?

35:45.120 --> 35:46.160
I don't know.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.040
Why did you keep all of his stuff?

36:12.920 --> 36:13.960
Mum.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.080
-Mum!

36:17.160 --> 36:18.640
Adam, you're home!

36:23.600 --> 36:24.840
Hi, Eric!

36:24.920 --> 36:25.960
Hi.

36:26.040 --> 36:28.000
-It's lovely to see you again.
-You as well.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.760
Oh, sorry. Um, this is Hugh. He's…

36:31.840 --> 36:33.440
Well, he… he's my…

36:33.520 --> 36:37.200
the guy that I'm dating at the moment.

36:37.280 --> 36:38.920
-How you doing?
-That's Adam.

36:40.480 --> 36:42.240
And this is Eric, Adam's…

36:43.680 --> 36:44.520
Uh…

36:45.040 --> 36:46.080
friend.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
Hi.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.360
Hi. Lovely to meet you.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.080
Do you boys want something to eat?

36:56.160 --> 36:58.720
Uh, no.
We're gonna go play some video games.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.160
Uh, actually, I'm going home.

37:01.240 --> 37:04.160
Lovely to see you again, Maureen.
Lovely to meet you, Hugh.

37:06.640 --> 37:07.560
Bye, mate.

37:07.640 --> 37:08.640
Yeah.

37:21.080 --> 37:22.000
Oh.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.280
Well, it's nice.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.400
It's not, but thank you.

37:32.800 --> 37:33.640
Dad?

37:33.720 --> 37:35.520
I'm… I'm stuck!

37:36.120 --> 37:37.000
Dad?

37:37.600 --> 37:39.720
-What are you doing?
-I dropped my biscuit!

37:41.320 --> 37:43.360
-My balance is fucked, Rubes!
-Can I help?

37:43.440 --> 37:44.720
You know it is.

37:46.160 --> 37:48.400
-Sorry. Oh Jesus.
-Oh!

37:48.480 --> 37:50.200
-Sorry, mate.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.480
Ah!

37:51.560 --> 37:52.640
Where's Mum?

37:53.200 --> 37:54.600
Can't waste a Hobnob.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.840
Oh, your mum got called in
for a cover shift at the hospital.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.720
Why didn't you call me?
I could've come back.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.560
I didn't wanna ruin your date.

38:04.240 --> 38:08.440
Speaking of, do I finally get to meet
the famous Otis?

38:09.200 --> 38:11.040
Otis, my dad, Roland. Dad, Otis.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.000
Hello!

38:12.640 --> 38:14.080
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

38:15.160 --> 38:18.040
Okay, you've met now,
so thanks for helping. Off you go.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.800
Go? But he just got here.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.760
Otis, stay for a bit.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.920
Let's… let's hang.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.680
No, Dad!

38:24.760 --> 38:26.320
Please don't say hang.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.320
Don't worry. I'll put on my dressing gown.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.120
-How about that?
-That sounds great.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.240
That'll be my weed dealer.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
Did the uniform really not fit,
or do you just not wanna wear it?

38:44.720 --> 38:46.320
Shit, sorry. Was that rude of me?

38:46.400 --> 38:47.840
No, it's fine. Uh…

38:48.360 --> 38:49.760
Wasn't the right fit for me.

38:49.840 --> 38:53.400
I don't like clothes clinging to my body,
but I don't really have a choice.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.080
A lot of people don't really get it.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.000
Who doesn't get it?

38:57.560 --> 38:59.160
The whole world, Jackson.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.200
I used to get changed
in the abandoned toilet block

39:02.280 --> 39:04.920
so the idiot popular girls
wouldn't say shit about my body.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.720
Other queer kids would change there too.

39:07.320 --> 39:08.560
It was more comfortable,

39:09.160 --> 39:11.000
but it's gone now, so…

39:11.640 --> 39:12.720
That's so messed up.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.600
-Yeah.
-Do you want me to talk to Hope about it?

39:16.640 --> 39:18.840
Thanks, but I can fight my own battles.

39:20.040 --> 39:22.920
-You're not head boy anymore, remember?
-Oh shit. Yeah, I forgot.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.680
This is the first time
I've felt calm in so long.

39:29.760 --> 39:31.520
Yeah. It's quite nice, right?

39:42.560 --> 39:43.680
Going on holiday, Mum?

39:43.760 --> 39:46.680
No! I need it
for my appeal to get Elsie back,

39:46.760 --> 39:48.960
which I wouldn't have to do
if it wasn't for you!

39:49.040 --> 39:50.800
For God's sake. Mum, please.

39:50.880 --> 39:54.200
Okay, I know I've hurt you.
I was just doing what I thought was right.

39:54.280 --> 39:56.600
I didn't want Elsie to get hurt
like Sean and I did

39:56.680 --> 39:57.960
'cause you have an illness.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.880
-What?
-You do! I'm sorry!

39:59.960 --> 40:02.320
I know it's not your fault,
and I know you're trying,

40:02.400 --> 40:03.920
but you haven't beaten it yet.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.080
You might not for a really long time.

40:07.360 --> 40:09.280
That doesn't mean I won't always love you.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.160
'Cause I'll always love you, Mum.

40:14.360 --> 40:15.560
Even if you hate me.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.840
Tell Isaac I'll be back
in a couple of days for my painting.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.480
My fingers aren't nimble anymore.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.360
Why don't you stick around for a smoke?

40:34.440 --> 40:37.240
Sure. Need a break
from the old ball-and-chain.

40:37.320 --> 40:40.560
Dad started smoking last year
because it helps with the pain,

40:40.640 --> 40:43.880
but we couldn't get it on prescription,
which is bullshit.

40:50.040 --> 40:51.600
Do you want a puff, Rubes?

40:51.680 --> 40:54.080
No, Dad. Who's gonna help you
when you fall out of bed again?

40:54.760 --> 40:57.120
-Otis?
-I'm fine, thank you.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.040
You are such an irresponsible parent!

40:59.120 --> 41:00.880
Young people.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.520
They're so clean-cut these days.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.920
Ah, yes.
Thank you, Roland.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.520
You got trouble at home, Jeffrey?

41:11.040 --> 41:12.880
Yeah, there was an incident.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.840
Our cat Jonathan died,
and now Cynthia wants to…

41:15.920 --> 41:16.800
Sorry, kids.

41:16.880 --> 41:18.440
…have sex all the time.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.480
It's constant.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.640
I'm not as young as I used to be.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.480
None of us are
as young as we used to be,

41:25.560 --> 41:27.760
but you gotta enjoy it while you still can

41:27.840 --> 41:30.360
'cause… …life's a bitch.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.560
It gets us all in the end.

41:32.640 --> 41:33.680
Dad, don't say that.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.920
Rubes doesn't like it
when I'm being nihilistic.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.240
I'm sorry, darlin'. I'll rein it in.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.040
She's such a good girl,

41:43.120 --> 41:45.320
so kind to me and her mum.

41:45.400 --> 41:49.040
Which is why it's nice to see her happy
since she's been dating you.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.680
Always going on about you.

41:50.760 --> 41:53.840
Otis this, and Otis that.

41:53.920 --> 41:56.080
Oh my God, Dad! Shut up!

41:56.160 --> 42:00.560
What? It's normal! I used to be like that
about your mum when we first met.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.960
Yeah, I used to be like that
about Cynthia too.

42:04.400 --> 42:05.640
To be young.

42:08.200 --> 42:11.080
Yeah, it was so nice to be young.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.440
Your dad's such a lightweight.

42:36.920 --> 42:39.560
-Do you wanna stay over?
-Thank you, but I should get home.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.160
I should probably get home too.

42:47.480 --> 42:48.760
Sorry about your cat.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.560
Thanks. Yeah, he was a great cat.

42:54.600 --> 42:57.200
A change in libido
is a common side-effect of grief.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.680
For some people, it's a coping strategy.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.920
Cynthia and me could never have kids.

43:04.880 --> 43:08.840
She really wanted them,
but they just never stuck, you know.

43:09.880 --> 43:13.040
So Jonathan was kinda like her son.

43:14.160 --> 43:17.920
Thought she'd fall apart without him
but been the opposite.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.320
She hasn't even cried.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.160
Grief hits people in different ways.

43:23.840 --> 43:26.800
Maybe that's why she wants
to be intimate with you all the time,

43:27.320 --> 43:29.200
to avoid feeling the sadness.

43:29.800 --> 43:31.040
Yeah, maybe.

43:33.920 --> 43:37.120
Hey, you're kinda like
an old man in a kid's body.

43:38.360 --> 43:39.760
Yeah, I get that a lot.

44:15.680 --> 44:17.440
Mum said you've painted me?

44:18.280 --> 44:19.160
Yeah.

44:20.160 --> 44:23.480
I was gonna give it to you
when we were still friends, but, um…

44:24.920 --> 44:26.520
Well, it would be a bit creepy now.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.040
Can I see it?

44:28.640 --> 44:30.840
Yeah. It's, uh, just under those.

44:31.360 --> 44:32.320
Okay.

44:39.120 --> 44:40.400
This looks nothing like me.

44:44.280 --> 44:47.400
-Mum's is pretty good though.
-Yeah, the props were her idea.

44:51.160 --> 44:52.880
Thank you for getting her to stay.

44:55.040 --> 44:56.240
I didn't do anything.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.560
I wanted to say
that I do know you, by the way.

45:05.080 --> 45:06.840
You said I didn't, but

45:07.760 --> 45:08.600
I do.

45:09.800 --> 45:12.200
I know
you still cut the crusts off your toast.

45:13.280 --> 45:15.240
That you bite your nails
when you're nervous,

45:15.760 --> 45:17.400
sometimes when you're feeling shy.

45:18.560 --> 45:21.360
That you could run
intellectual rings around anybody,

45:22.280 --> 45:25.440
but you don't because you're basically
a very good person.

45:26.720 --> 45:28.760
Which is why you give me a hard time,

45:29.560 --> 45:31.400
more than anyone else I've ever met,

45:32.480 --> 45:36.320
because you know
that's what's gonna make me feel seen.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.080
Every time I'm around you,

45:40.880 --> 45:42.080
all my cells are

45:42.800 --> 45:43.840
fizzy

45:44.800 --> 45:47.040
and alive, and everything feels hopeful.

45:47.760 --> 45:50.560
I just wish
that I could take back what I did

45:51.920 --> 45:53.040
because…

45:55.360 --> 45:58.120
I'm afraid I'm not gonna have you
in my life anymore.

46:07.800 --> 46:09.240
You'll always be in my life.

46:10.200 --> 46:12.840
But if you ever lie to me again,
I will cut your ball sack off.

46:13.360 --> 46:14.280
Okay?

46:15.800 --> 46:16.720
Noted.

46:20.440 --> 46:21.680
See you at breakfast.

46:25.520 --> 46:26.520
All right?

46:42.040 --> 46:45.240
-What took you so long, lover boy?
-Fucking hell!

46:45.320 --> 46:46.520
Cynthia, stop!

46:47.320 --> 46:49.200
I can't keep having sex with you.

46:49.280 --> 46:50.720
I'm really tired!

46:53.440 --> 46:55.960
And I think
we need to talk about Jonathan.

46:57.960 --> 46:59.440
I don't think that I can.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.080
Why not, love?

47:03.640 --> 47:05.440
Because…

47:08.280 --> 47:10.400
because it's too painful.

47:11.840 --> 47:13.920
-I know, Cynth.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.800
-I know.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.080
Minneapolis-ah!

48:14.960 --> 48:15.800
Hey.

48:16.880 --> 48:18.920
-Hey. How was your night?

48:20.040 --> 48:21.120
It was fun.

48:21.200 --> 48:23.160
It was a bit odd but nice.

48:23.760 --> 48:25.880
Did you know Adam watches the Kardashians?

48:25.960 --> 48:28.400
No, but it doesn't surprise me.

48:31.840 --> 48:34.160
Hey, I am sorry about earlier.

48:35.440 --> 48:36.280
I'm an only child.

48:36.360 --> 48:39.800
I'm not very good at sharing my space,
but I am working on it.

48:40.840 --> 48:44.880
I know this must be hard for you, too,
so you can borrow my records whenever.

48:44.960 --> 48:46.840
Thanks, Otis. That means a lot.

48:48.400 --> 48:51.440
So, um, you and Ruby
are getting pretty serious, then?

48:53.320 --> 48:54.400
Maybe.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.640
-Hey.
-My dad was embarrassing tonight.

49:14.720 --> 49:15.920
I'm so sorry about that.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.360
It's fine. It's fine.
He's a… he's a funny guy.

49:19.440 --> 49:21.360
Yeah, he is kind of great, isn't he?

49:23.680 --> 49:27.120
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
You're the best.

49:27.640 --> 49:29.680
It's no problem. I had a good time.

49:30.760 --> 49:31.760
I'm glad.

49:33.760 --> 49:34.680
Okay.

49:35.560 --> 49:36.840
Night, then, Otis.

49:37.720 --> 49:38.800
Good night, Rubes.

49:40.160 --> 49:41.120
I love you.

49:44.680 --> 49:45.680
Oh.

49:46.360 --> 49:47.360
That's nice.

49:49.600 --> 49:51.120
Good night, then.
