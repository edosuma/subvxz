00:02.920 --> 00:05.321
Crossroads are where pacts are made.
Serious spell work.

00:05.520 --> 00:08.683
- Used to summon a demon.
- People are making deals with the thing.

00:08.840 --> 00:11.127
They're seeing hellhounds,
demonic pit bulls.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.051
- Aah!
- You can control them?

00:14.280 --> 00:15.361
Sic them, boy!

00:15.640 --> 00:18.211
Garth finally got into
his houseboat but Kevin's...

00:18.360 --> 00:20.362
...having trouble reading their
half of the tablet.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.284
- What's that stuff?
- Goofer dust.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.444
You boys think you know something,
but not goofer dust?

00:25.640 --> 00:27.927
- What is it?
- Hoodoo. Keeps out demons.

00:28.920 --> 00:33.847
In the box is a key
to every object, scroll, spell...

00:34.000 --> 00:36.731
...ever collected in a thousand years
under one roof.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.526
It is the supernatural mother lode.

00:39.720 --> 00:44.169
If knowledge is power, then this is the
most powerful place on Earth.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.444
Good morning, Warsaw...

00:51.000 --> 00:52.764
...welcome to the morning zoo.
Today we're...

01:27.880 --> 01:29.484
Good morning, War...

02:01.560 --> 02:02.721
Holy crap.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.491
Holy crap.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.007
Holy crap.

02:21.160 --> 02:24.482
Good morning, Moo-ssouri,
this is Radio Warsaw...

02:55.240 --> 02:56.810
Hey, Mom.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.131
Wow.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.881
Not bad.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.366
Not bad?

03:10.080 --> 03:13.482
- I haven't had my own room ever.
- Heh.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.042
I'm making this awesome.
I got my kick ass vinyl...

03:17.960 --> 03:20.008
...I've got this killer mattress.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.411
Memory foam.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.410
It remembers me.

03:27.960 --> 03:33.000
And it's clean too. There's no funky
smell, there's no creepy motel stains.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.087
Really?

03:43.360 --> 03:45.044
I'm gonna go fix us some grub.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.485
What you reading?

04:16.880 --> 04:19.201
Sort of, uh, everything.

04:19.480 --> 04:20.766
Huh, good.

04:20.920 --> 04:24.720
Somebody's gonna have to dig through
all this and it ain't gonna be me.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.201
You made these?

04:27.760 --> 04:29.489
We have a real kitchen now.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.611
I know, I just didn't think you
knew what a kitchen was.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.047
I'm nesting. Okay? Eat.

04:44.640 --> 04:48.087
- Huh? Yeah.
- Wow.

04:48.240 --> 04:50.049
You're welcome.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.727
Yo.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.611
- Dean? Come quick.
- What?

05:01.480 --> 05:04.290
Kevin? Kevin?

05:04.720 --> 05:05.960
Something wrong?

05:06.480 --> 05:07.845
Guess.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.522
Kevin? It's us.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.130
Found him.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.368
You look like hammered crap.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.449
- Yeah.
- Are you sleeping?

05:54.040 --> 05:55.690
- Not really.
- Eating?

05:56.200 --> 05:57.440
Hot dogs, mostly.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.804
Sure, breakfast of champions.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.731
I feel dirty saying this,
but you might want a salad.

06:02.920 --> 06:06.322
- And a shower.
- And I've been getting bad headaches...

06:06.480 --> 06:09.962
...and nosebleeds, and I think maybe
I had a small stroke.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.285
But it was worth it.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.521
What was worth it?

06:17.240 --> 06:19.481
I figured out how to close
the Gates of Hell.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.166
You...

06:23.440 --> 06:25.568
Come here, you smelly son of a bitch.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.441
- What?
- Okay, okay.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.766
So, what does this mean?

06:30.920 --> 06:32.922
- What are we looking at?
- It's a spell.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.407
- And?
- And it's just a few words of Enochian, but...

06:37.560 --> 06:40.086
- Yeah, here we go.
- The spell has to be spoken...

06:40.240 --> 06:44.609
- ...after you finish each of the three trials.
- Trials, like Law & Order?

06:44.760 --> 06:46.489
More like Hercules.

06:46.680 --> 06:52.050
The tablet says, "whosoever chooses
to undertake these tasks should...

06:52.400 --> 06:55.882
...fear not danger, nor death, nor..."

06:56.040 --> 07:01.649
...a word I think means getting your spine
ripped out through your mouth for eternity.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.241
Good times.

07:03.480 --> 07:06.484
Basically, God built a series
of tests. And...

07:06.640 --> 07:09.246
...when you've done all three,
you can slam the Gates.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.801
So, what?
God wants us to take the SATs?

07:11.960 --> 07:15.487
I guess. He works in mysterious ways.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.802
Mysterious, douche-y ways.
Where do we start?

07:17.960 --> 07:22.124
I've only been able to crack
one of the tests so far and it's gross.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.848
You've gotta kill a hound of hell
and bathe in its blood.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.004
- Awesome.
- Awesome?

07:29.200 --> 07:30.247
Yeah.

07:31.320 --> 07:35.086
If this means icing all demons,
I got no problem gutting some devil dog...

07:35.240 --> 07:38.289
- ...and letting Calgon take me away.
- Where you gonna find one?

07:38.480 --> 07:40.608
Hellhounds like to collect
on crossroads deals...

07:40.760 --> 07:44.810
...so we track down a loser who signed
over his special sauce 10 years ago...

07:44.960 --> 07:47.884
...get between him and Clifford
the Big Dead Dog. Easy.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.089
- Doesn't sound easy.
- It's not.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.123
You get on the Net,
see what you can dig up.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.488
I'm on a supply run,
we need goof er dust...

07:54.680 --> 07:58.685
...and the kid needs to eat something that's
not ground up hooves and pigs' anuses.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.888
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.410
Okay, I feel a lot better.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.120
Kevin, buddy, you gotta slow down.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.848
- What?
- Get some shut-eye.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.048
Take a day off, open a window.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.365
No.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.288
You said nuking hell. That's how I get out.
That's how I go home.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.960
Right, it is. But you can't live like this.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.241
You think I want to?

08:30.840 --> 08:32.126
I hate it here.

08:32.720 --> 08:36.884
I can't leave because every demon on
the planet wants to peel my face off.

08:37.039 --> 08:40.965
I can't talk to anyone except you guys
or Garth, when he swings by, or my mom.

08:41.240 --> 08:44.005
Right? And when she calls
all she does is cry.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.966
I just...

08:48.200 --> 08:49.725
I need this to be over.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.131
I know. I do.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.240
But trust me on this.

08:54.480 --> 08:56.926
This whole saving the world thing...

08:57.360 --> 08:59.522
It's a marathon, not a sprint.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.282
You gotta take better care of yourself.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.006
Hey.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.605
Did you know that there are like
6000 kinds of tomatoes?

09:15.920 --> 09:18.446
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah. Demon signs.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.564
Ten years ago, all centered
on Shoshone, Idaho.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.206
Okay. Well, big time mojo
means big time freak.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.206
So anybody have a horseshoe
shoved up his ass?

09:27.720 --> 09:30.200
That's one way of putting it. Ahem.

09:31.120 --> 09:35.887
Meet the Cassitys, small-time farmers who
struck oil on their land in February of '03.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.641
- It's weird because geological surveys...
- Yeah, you had me at weird.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.207
- All right, we thinking deal?
- Best lead we got.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.847
Well, let's go visit the
Beverly Hillbillies.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.968
You stay here, work on
step number two...

09:47.120 --> 09:50.010
...if you come across anything
on hellhounds, drop a dime...

09:50.200 --> 09:53.363
...because between the claws,
the teeth, and the invisibility...

09:53.560 --> 09:56.325
...those bitches can be real bitches.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.084
I got you a present.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.364
The, uh, blue ones are for the headaches...

10:03.080 --> 10:05.481
...and the green ones are for pep.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.650
Don't OD.

10:08.480 --> 10:09.606
Thanks.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.645
You sure about that?

10:13.440 --> 10:16.922
Sam, we are on the one yard line.
It is time to play through the pain.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.402
Keep an eye out. Anybody with a hellhound
on them will show signs...

10:40.560 --> 10:42.608
...hallucinating, freaking out, the usual.

10:42.800 --> 10:45.451
- And if we find someone?
- You get them clear...

10:46.200 --> 10:48.885
...I spike Fido, the crowd goes wild.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.609
Hey, pal, who runs this joint?

11:01.280 --> 11:02.406
You're looking at her.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.241
You own the ranch?

11:07.400 --> 11:09.129
Nope, just manage the property.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.091
You guys here about the job?

11:12.240 --> 11:13.321
How'd you guess?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.207
- We get our share of drifters.
- Ah.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.925
Ever worked a farm before?

11:18.400 --> 11:19.606
Definitely.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.885
We're quick learners.

11:23.880 --> 11:24.927
Ellie.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.766
Who we got here?

11:26.920 --> 11:28.684
I'm Dean, this is Sam.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.442
- Carl Granville, a pleasure.
- Pleasure.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.807
- So you're not a Cassity?
- My wife is.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.970
Her and her family own the place.
I'm just one of those, uh...

11:37.120 --> 11:39.930
...what do you call them,
trophy husbands. Ha, ha.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.764
So, we hiring the fellas?

11:44.160 --> 11:45.241
Not sure yet.

11:45.440 --> 11:46.487
Oh, come on...

11:46.680 --> 11:49.570
- ...they seem like swell guys.
- Oh, he's right. We're swell.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.525
You bed down in here.

12:05.920 --> 12:09.402
Breakfast is at 5, dinner is at 8,
and in between you're mine.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.721
Questions?

12:11.600 --> 12:12.761
I miss my room.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.161
We're good.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.527
Okay.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.530
Job is yours if you want it.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.201
But I gotta warn you, it's crap work.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.888
Crap. She literally meant crap.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.361
I hate you.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.768
I don't care. Do I look like a hippie?

12:37.960 --> 12:42.761
Organic food is better for the cattle.
My land, my animals, my money, my way.

12:42.920 --> 12:44.206
End of story.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.570
She's a real piece of work, huh?

12:51.880 --> 12:54.247
Alice Cassity's a piece of
something, all right.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.201
But what are we gonna do? She's the boss.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.607
Drink?

13:06.440 --> 13:08.920
- So, what are we thinking?
- About deal-wise?

13:09.080 --> 13:11.321
Well, Ellie's the help,
so that rules her out.

13:11.480 --> 13:15.041
And Carl doesn't really seem
like the sell-your-soul type. So Alice?

13:15.200 --> 13:17.601
- Ding-ding-ding.
- Should we talk to her?

13:17.760 --> 13:20.570
Why? So she can lie to us
and then call the cops? No.

13:20.960 --> 13:23.611
No, we're gonna have to go
stalker on this one, Sammy.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.329
- A whole horse? Seriously?
- No, yeah. Yeah.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.649
- How is that even possible?
- What did she say?

13:36.960 --> 13:38.928
- Just a wolf.
- Yeah.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.648
Probably spooked the hell out of
the horses. I should check on them.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.401
- All right. Hurry back.
- Okay.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.130
No!

14:25.440 --> 14:26.851
God almighty.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.405
I'm sorry, Ellie.
Carl seemed like a good guy.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.601
The best.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.881
- His head was practically ripped off?
- And you are?

14:40.800 --> 14:43.201
- Just curious.
- He's new. He works here.

14:43.840 --> 14:45.888
Carl died bad, let's leave it at that.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.085
They've been reintroducing wolves,
but I never thought...

14:49.280 --> 14:50.964
This wasn't a wolf.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.204
I gotta make some phone calls.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.767
The whole family's flying in for this.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.170
All the Cassitys under one roof.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.367
Good luck.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.409
Son of a bitch.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.566
So, what do you think?

15:11.400 --> 15:14.051
I think Carl signed the deal.
Now he's dog food.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.961
Hellhound's gone and we were too busy
chasing a pile of jack to stop it.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.448
Let's grab our stuff and get out of here.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.530
You okay, Mrs. Cassity?

15:42.600 --> 15:44.967
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

15:46.880 --> 15:48.848
I really am. And...

15:49.880 --> 15:52.406
...I know I shouldn't be,
because I loved Carl...

15:53.960 --> 15:56.201
...I think. I just can't remember why.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.406
What do you mean?

16:01.560 --> 16:04.723
I mean, Carl grew up around here...

16:04.880 --> 16:08.202
...we went to school together and
he was always mooning over me but...

16:08.480 --> 16:11.927
...I never... I used to make fun of him.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.724
When did you two get together?

16:14.120 --> 16:16.771
Valentine's Day, 2003.

16:17.520 --> 16:22.048
I was at this party. Carl was there and it was
like I was seeing him for the first time.

16:23.080 --> 16:28.325
You know, suddenly he was cute,
and smart and funny, and it was magic.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.201
Carl and I were happy for 10 years.

16:34.560 --> 16:38.246
But now he's dead,
and I'm not sad, angry...

16:38.600 --> 16:41.524
...I'm just fine.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.761
Hey, we, uh... We have any graveyard din?

16:52.200 --> 16:53.929
- We should, why?
- Yarrow?

16:54.080 --> 16:57.482
Yeah, no. Dean, no.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.843
We're not summoning
a crossroads demon.

17:00.080 --> 17:04.243
Plan A bombed, so welcome to plan B.
We get some red eyed bitch in a trap...

17:04.400 --> 17:07.529
...hold a knife on her until she
calls a pooch. Special delivery.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.968
Except when Crowley finds out we're dialing
hell, he won't send one hellhound...

17:11.119 --> 17:14.442
...he'll send 100.
That's not a plan, that's suicide.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.967
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah, we stay here.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.329
I just talked to Alice in the barn.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.602
Carl didn't sell his soul for oil...

17:21.960 --> 17:24.201
- ...he sold it for Alice.
- His wife?

17:24.480 --> 17:27.290
He loved her, she barely noticed him,
so he made a deal.

17:27.599 --> 17:30.285
And now that time's up,
it's like she barely even knew the guy.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.445
You think our demon signed up more
than one schmuck here?

17:34.640 --> 17:36.404
Wouldn't be the first time.

17:36.560 --> 17:39.962
This family's rich because someone
booked a one-way ticket downstairs.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.891
And as of tomorrow,
they're all gonna be right here.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.771
And you wanna scope them out?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.408
I wanna kill a hellhound, and not die.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.167
How about you?

17:57.120 --> 17:58.690
Two days, then we do it my way.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.610
Meet Noah Cassity.

18:19.800 --> 18:23.646
He's 71, worth a billion,
and just married wife number five...

18:23.960 --> 18:27.282
- ...a 20-year-old lingerie model.
- Because they have so much in common.

18:27.480 --> 18:31.007
Alice is his oldest
and that's Cindy, the middle girl.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.731
She had a single on the country chart a few
years ago.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.571
Then she started hitting the bottle
and, well...

18:37.160 --> 18:39.481
...her last album was holiday
songs for dogs.

18:39.720 --> 18:44.487
My favorites were: "Jingle Bark Rock" and
"Don't Pee on this Tree, Happy Arbor Day."

18:44.720 --> 18:46.927
- So she's the devil.
- Pretty much.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.089
And there's the baby, Margot.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.290
She ran away just before Alice
and Carl tied the knot.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.726
Lives in Paris.

18:55.040 --> 18:58.761
- How do you know all this?
- I've been working this farm since I was 13...

18:59.160 --> 19:00.650
...and I've got eyes.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.809
Okay, tonight is an
all-hands-on-deck situation.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.887
I'm gonna need one of you inside
serving dinner and pouring drinks.

19:11.320 --> 19:12.651
A lot of drinks.

19:12.880 --> 19:16.441
Okay, well, have fun. I won't wait up.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.369
And somebody's gotta man the grill.

19:20.880 --> 19:21.927
What kind of grill?

19:27.840 --> 19:31.447
- Impressed?
- I do like a man who can handle his meat.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.125
Really? Keep it coming, Ken Doll.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.969
You're the best, Ellie.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.445
Al, I'm so sorry about Carl.

19:55.640 --> 19:58.325
I mean, he was the love of your life.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.807
- Right.
- Please, she can do better.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.089
Maybe Alice should marry a child.
Take after her father.

20:04.280 --> 20:08.444
- Ivanka's not a child.
- She's a prostitute who looks like a child.

20:08.680 --> 20:13.242
- Are you done? Alice is in mourning.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Margie, I didn't see you there.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.647
You're too far up on your high horse.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.610
Ha, ha! Oh, yes, but you are right...

20:19.080 --> 20:22.084
...we should all take a minute and say
a few words about Carl.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.931
You first. Was he a good lay?

20:27.120 --> 20:29.202
- What?
- Oh, you didn't know?

20:29.360 --> 20:32.045
Yeah. Daddy caught them going
at it in the barn.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.482
Al, it was before you two got together.

20:36.640 --> 20:39.041
I mean, Carl, he loved you.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.965
Yeah, that was back
when Margie was fat and...

20:42.400 --> 20:44.846
...Cin was sober. A long time ago.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.805
- Get cancer and die, old man.
- You first, sweetie.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.726
- Are they always like this?
- More or less.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.087
How can you work here?

20:53.560 --> 20:57.042
I love the property, I love the animals,
and I tune out the people.

20:58.880 --> 21:02.168
I can't remember the last time we all
sat down for a meal together.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.607
It was back at the old, crappy house...

21:04.760 --> 21:07.604
...when Daddy invited that traveling
salesman to dinner.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.689
Yeah, him.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.842
- And so charming.
- And English.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.361
What was his name? Kenny?

21:14.520 --> 21:15.965
Crow...
- Crowl...

21:17.280 --> 21:19.362
Crow... Crowley.
- Crow...

21:24.320 --> 21:25.970
- Crowley?
- That's what they said.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.322
Swung through town
10 years ago. To the day.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.802
You think Tea and Crumpets
made these deals and now he's collecting?

21:31.960 --> 21:34.201
Or he just sent his dog.
Told it to go fetch.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.011
King of Hell, grabbing a few souls?
Below his pay grade.

21:37.160 --> 21:40.289
- Any idea who signed the dotted line?
- I have no clue. It's brutal in there.

21:43.200 --> 21:44.406
Hey, Kev, what's up?

21:44.600 --> 21:48.730
Hey, Dean.
Good news. Uh, I think. Kind of.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.411
Don't oversell it.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.246
Sorry. I found something
on the tablet about hellhounds...

21:54.400 --> 21:56.004
...uh, this mean anything to you?

21:56.200 --> 21:58.680
"The dire creatures may be seen only
by the damned...

21:58.840 --> 22:01.127
...or through an object scorched
with holy fire."

22:01.280 --> 22:03.886
- Like with holy oil?
- It's gotta be.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.401
- We could use a window.
- Or glasses.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.529
I think we got
Jesus Juice in the trunk.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.484
I'll take care of the x-ray specs.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.251
Stay here. Don't let J.R.
and the gang out of your sight.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.563
Hey, Kevin, uh, you did great, man.
Get some sleep.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.126
Okay. Thanks.

22:44.040 --> 22:47.487
Oh, look, Daddy's drunk and armed.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.244
Must be Christmas.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.929
Hey. Hey, hey, hey-

23:00.800 --> 23:03.770
- Where are you going?
- Wherever I damn well please.

23:04.040 --> 23:06.168
Wolf that killed my son-in-law?

23:06.400 --> 23:08.482
He's a man-eater, gotta be put down.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.006
We're doing this for Carl.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.965
- Okay, just... Just hold on a second.
- No, going now.

23:14.320 --> 23:15.481
I'll come with you.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.321
You know anything about hunting, boy?

23:20.040 --> 23:21.246
A little bit, yeah.

23:29.800 --> 23:30.881
Let's do it.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.047
I like it.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.205
The whole Clark Kent look.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.726
Ellie, hey.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.207
Hey.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.367
So...

24:18.280 --> 24:19.850
...I think you're really hot.

24:21.640 --> 24:25.122
You wanna go to my room
and have sex?

24:27.880 --> 24:28.927
What?

24:29.440 --> 24:31.124
L... Sorry.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.567
I don't usually do this.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.689
I guess I'm feeling my oats.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.246
I can't.

24:40.640 --> 24:41.687
What?

24:46.960 --> 24:52.444
- Okay. Uh, embarrassing.
- Oh, no, no, no. No, I want to.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.604
- Uh, heh. Believe me.
- No, it's okay, you don't.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.730
- I guess I'm gonna...
- Ellie, um...

25:00.200 --> 25:01.247
Rain check.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.610
This is one night only.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.284
Watch yourself, boy.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.447
- Where's Margie?
- I thought she was with you.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.042
- Oh, my God.
- Go back to the house!

26:20.240 --> 26:22.163
- No. No. My girl.
- Go!

26:35.960 --> 26:38.088
- What was that thing?
- It's a hellhound.

26:38.360 --> 26:41.842
When you sell your soul to a demon,
they come and rip it out of you.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.930
- Demon?
- Crowley.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.405
Poncey guy, about yay big,
mountain of dicks.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.245
He was here 10 years ago
making dreams come true.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.523
If you didn't sign, that freak
out there won't touch you...

26:54.720 --> 26:57.849
...but if you did, I need to know
and I need to know now.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.365
So hands up.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.285
So wait. The British guy was a demon...

27:02.680 --> 27:04.648
...and now there's a hellhound after us?

27:05.120 --> 27:08.408
- Are you insane?
- They're obviously insane.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.041
- Don't play dumb.
- Yeah, I'm not playing.

27:11.200 --> 27:14.283
- I didn't sell my damn soul.
- Well somebody did.

27:14.800 --> 27:18.407
And the sooner that idiot owns up,
the sooner the rest of you can go.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.884
- All right. Seal them in.
- Yeah.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.691
- What?
- I'm gonna spread goof er dust around...

27:25.880 --> 27:28.770
...the doors, the windows.
That will keep the hellhound out.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.645
- For awhile.
- What does that...?

27:30.800 --> 27:33.804
- How long?
- Long enough for me to stab it in its throat.

27:34.440 --> 27:37.125
No way, no way,
you can't do this. You can't...

27:37.320 --> 27:40.130
Yes, I can. You wanna know why?
Because it's what I do.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.691
And, buddy, I'm the best.

27:41.840 --> 27:46.084
See, I gut Old Yeller out there and maybe,
just maybe, you walk away.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.726
I don't, you're meat.

27:49.400 --> 27:52.165
So sit down, shut up...

27:54.280 --> 27:55.850
...and put these on.

28:03.280 --> 28:06.170
I don't... Who are you people?

28:06.560 --> 28:07.607
We're here to help.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.284
Like you helped Margie?

28:11.440 --> 28:15.445
When the hellhound gets close,
you might see things, hear things.

28:15.680 --> 28:19.082
Gonna feel like you took the
brown acid, and it's trying to kill you.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.402
The handcuffs
are so you won't hurt yourselves.

28:21.560 --> 28:25.281
And when one of you starts bugging out
we'll know who's on tap to be puppy chow.

28:39.840 --> 28:42.684
So, what's our play?

28:43.160 --> 28:45.845
While you camp here,
figure out who whored their soul...

28:46.000 --> 28:47.650
...I'm gonna scout the grounds...

28:47.800 --> 28:51.247
...see if I can't gank Huckleberry Hound
before he makes his next move.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.721
- You're not going alone. I'm going with you.
- Wrong.

28:53.880 --> 28:57.726
- Uh, they're on lockdown, you need back-up.
- No, I don't.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.651
- Yes, you do.
- No, I need you to be safe, Sam. Okay?

29:00.880 --> 29:03.565
- That's what I need.
- What? When am I...?

29:04.240 --> 29:05.924
When are we ever safe?

29:07.320 --> 29:09.209
- This is different.
- How?

29:11.480 --> 29:13.847
Because of the Three Trials crap.

29:14.400 --> 29:18.041
God's little obstacle course. We've
been down roads like this before, man.

29:18.720 --> 29:22.691
With Yellow Eyes, Lucifer,
Dick frigging Roman.

29:22.840 --> 29:26.640
We both know where this ends.
One of us dies...

29:26.800 --> 29:27.926
...or worse.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.766
So, what? You just up
and decided it's gonna be you?

29:30.920 --> 29:35.050
I'm a grunt, Sam, you're not. You've always
been the brains of this operation...

29:35.440 --> 29:38.649
- Dean.
- You told me that you see a way out.

29:39.240 --> 29:42.926
You see a light at the end of this
ugly ass tunnel. I don't.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.447
But I'll tell you what I do know...

29:46.760 --> 29:49.206
...it's that I'm gonna die
with a gun in my hand.

29:50.520 --> 29:54.241
Because that's what I have waiting for me.
That's all I have waiting for me.

29:54.440 --> 29:58.604
I want you to get out.
I want you to have a life.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.209
Become a man of letters, whatever.

30:01.440 --> 30:04.967
You, with a wife, and kids, and...
And... And grandkids.

30:05.120 --> 30:09.967
Living until you're fat, bald, and chugging
Viagra. That is my perfect ending.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.202
And it's the only one that I'm gonna get.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.801
So I'm gonna do these Trials...

30:17.000 --> 30:21.449
...and I'm gonna do them alone.
End of story.

30:21.600 --> 30:26.401
You're staying here, I'm going out there.
If Land Shark comes knocking, you call me.

30:27.960 --> 30:31.646
If you try to follow me, I'm gonna
put a bullet in your damn leg.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.963
- You sold your soul. Admit it.
- Why the hell would you think that?

31:25.120 --> 31:28.169
You're a walking corpse
married to a centerfold. I did the math.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.727
She likes money, and I'm rich.
Do it again.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.885
Look, you sing like crap
so explain the music career.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.528
- Hello. Autotune.
- All right. That's enough.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.682
Oh, is it, Four Eyes, is it enough?

31:39.840 --> 31:42.366
Don't know why you even think
one of us made a deal.

31:42.520 --> 31:46.411
Because you struck oil where there
was no oil. That didn't seem weird to you?

31:47.240 --> 31:48.321
Margie.

31:49.280 --> 31:51.089
Margie used to say that...

31:51.920 --> 31:53.888
That if we were rich, we'd all be happy.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.490
Right, we're the damn Waltons.

32:09.360 --> 32:13.001
When I think about you, I touch myself

32:13.200 --> 32:16.124
Oh, I don't want any...

32:19.200 --> 32:20.565
Just in time.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.567
- Yeah. Are you okay?
- I'm good.

32:24.480 --> 32:26.209
And I bet you're great.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.126
- Yup. Great.
- Okay.

32:33.440 --> 32:34.487
Listen...

32:36.520 --> 32:40.411
Whatever happens, whatever you hear,
stay here with that door locked.

32:40.640 --> 32:45.726
Sit tight, okay? This is gonna sound crazy,
but there is something evil out there.

32:46.720 --> 32:47.846
I know.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.247
You know?

32:51.960 --> 32:53.564
It's coming for me.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.248
I need to take a leak.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.447
- Hold it.
- Yeah, at my age?

33:15.600 --> 33:19.082
Not really an option. So, either you let
me go, or get me a bottle.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.242
Ugh. You're disgusting.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.007
Wait!

33:48.080 --> 33:51.163
Aah! Please, just let me go. Please.

33:54.200 --> 33:57.522
- Please, don't hurt my family.
- I'm not. I'm trying to help.

34:03.400 --> 34:04.765
- Get in the house.
- But...

34:04.920 --> 34:06.809
- Go! Go!
- Oh, God.

34:11.880 --> 34:14.610
When my parents split up,
my mom took a job here.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.808
This was before the Cassitys had money.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.204
But it was the best she could do.

34:21.120 --> 34:24.203
- So I grew up on this farm.
- That's how you met Crowley.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.245
They had this big dinner...

34:26.639 --> 34:28.802
...and after, I saw him kissing Margie.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.487
I ran. I didn't know what to do.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.364
But Crowley found me. We talked.

34:36.520 --> 34:39.763
- He seemed so nice.
- The best con men always do.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.241
He asked me if I had one wish,
what would it be?

34:43.159 --> 34:44.446
So I told him.

34:45.600 --> 34:49.206
- And he made you sign over your soul.
- He didn't make me do anything.

34:49.719 --> 34:53.088
My mom, she had Parkinson's.
Early stages...

34:53.920 --> 34:55.922
...and I knew how that story would end.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.405
So I took the deal.

34:59.960 --> 35:02.327
Mom is retired down in Phoenix now.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.528
Plays golf every day.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.125
That was a stupid move, Ellie.

35:06.360 --> 35:09.762
I did it for my mom, Dean.
What would you do for your mom?

35:12.600 --> 35:15.206
- You had to know this was coming.
- No, how?

35:15.720 --> 35:17.927
He didn't tell you about
the 10 year clock?

35:18.120 --> 35:19.167
What?

35:19.360 --> 35:21.681
I knew when I died
I wasn't going to heaven...

35:21.880 --> 35:25.009
...but he never said anything
about that or monsters.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.281
What a douchebag.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.486
He probably didn't say jack
to Carl or Margot either.

35:29.680 --> 35:30.806
Margie made a deal?

35:32.120 --> 35:35.090
- So she's...
- She's gone.

35:36.600 --> 35:40.400
Oh, God. I...

35:41.200 --> 35:43.168
A few years ago, Carl got drunk...

35:43.320 --> 35:45.926
...he told me he did some kind of
magic at a crossroads.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.324
Summoned a demon.

35:49.560 --> 35:53.087
I put two and two together, and
when I saw what that thing did to him...

35:54.720 --> 35:56.449
I just never knew about Margie.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.520
I thought I was next.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.207
- And you didn't run?
- Where would I run?

36:01.600 --> 36:05.650
All I wanted was one last meal,
some good tunes, and maybe...

36:13.000 --> 36:15.082
I don't wanna die.

36:27.720 --> 36:29.051
Dean, what's happening?

36:29.200 --> 36:32.010
Ellie, whatever you're
seeing, it's not real.

36:33.360 --> 36:35.044
It means the hellhound, it's close.

36:36.080 --> 36:38.128
Look, you need to stay...

36:38.720 --> 36:40.484
...inside this circle, okay?

36:43.080 --> 36:45.731
- Now.
- Dean.

36:46.240 --> 36:50.086
No matter what happens, you stay
inside that circle, you understand me?

37:29.400 --> 37:31.289
So you're Crowley's bitch.

37:31.480 --> 37:34.051
I guess pets really do look
like their owners.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.207
What are you waiting for?
Come and get it.

38:43.720 --> 38:46.200
- You need to go to a hospital.
- I've had worse.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.451
Yeah, he's had worse.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.931
So, what now?

38:54.240 --> 38:57.244
Now we make a hex bag
and you start running.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.764
If Crowley can't find you,
he won't sic another mutt on you.

39:01.280 --> 39:04.204
- So I'm not going to hell?
- Not on my watch.

39:06.360 --> 39:07.566
You give us a minute?

39:08.600 --> 39:10.568
- Sure.
- Thanks.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.807
Dean, even if she can dodge Crowley...

39:18.480 --> 39:21.609
...as soon as Ellie dies,
her soul is earmarked for hell.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.210
Not if we shut it down first.

39:27.680 --> 39:30.365
The spell's not gonna work for you, Dean.

39:43.040 --> 39:46.442
Doesn't matter, we'll track down
another hellhound, and I'll kill it.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.650
No.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.251
- Sam, I didn't pass the test.
- But I did...

39:53.840 --> 39:56.366
- ...and I'm doing the rest of them.
- My ass you are.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.850
Closing the Gates,
it's a suicide mission for you.

40:01.080 --> 40:03.287
- Sam.
- I wanna slam hell shut too, okay?

40:03.480 --> 40:06.211
But I wanna survive it. I wanna live.

40:06.720 --> 40:08.006
And so should you.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.245
You have friends up here, family...

40:11.720 --> 40:13.688
...hell, you even got your own room now.

40:14.240 --> 40:15.924
You were right, okay?

40:16.800 --> 40:18.882
I see light at the end of this tunnel...

40:19.920 --> 40:23.208
...and I'm sorry you don't, I am.

40:23.720 --> 40:24.767
But it's there.

40:25.720 --> 40:28.849
And if you come with me,
I can take you to it.

40:29.200 --> 40:32.647
- Sam, be smart.
- I am smart, and so are you.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.727
You're not a grunt, Dean, you're a genius.

40:36.240 --> 40:40.882
When it comes to lore, to... You're the best
hunter I've ever seen. Better than me...

40:41.320 --> 40:45.041
...better than dad. I
believe in you, Dean...

40:46.400 --> 40:51.486
...so please, please believe in me too.

41:17.720 --> 41:20.121
- Hey. Sammy?
- Ugh. Unh.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.690
Sam?

41:28.080 --> 41:29.320
- You okay?
- Unh!

41:44.640 --> 41:45.880
I'm good. I'm okay.

41:48.640 --> 41:49.880
I can do this.
