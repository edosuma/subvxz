WEBVTT

02:21.320 --> 02:22.630
With president Helen Colton

02:22.630 --> 02:24.740
arriving for the G7 Summit in Brussels,

02:24.740 --> 02:26.030
the crisis in the Ukraine

02:26.030 --> 02:27.680
will be the main issue discussed.

02:28.860 --> 02:30.570
The other six leaders taking part

02:30.570 --> 02:32.750
will also address issues on trade security

02:32.750 --> 02:34.340
and climate change.

02:34.340 --> 02:35.970
This will be the first G7 Summit

02:35.970 --> 02:37.800
hosted by the European Union.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.890
Originally, a G8 Summit was to take place

02:39.890 --> 02:42.870
in Sochi, Russia, but
with that nation's invasion

02:42.870 --> 02:45.160
and annexation of the
Crimea in Ukraine,

02:45.160 --> 02:47.560
the decision was made to
expel Russia from this summit

02:47.560 --> 02:49.280
and move it to Brussels.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.380
With Russia, President Colton must manage

02:51.380 --> 02:52.940
this diplomatic falling out

02:52.940 --> 02:55.600
as the United States relies
on Russia's space program

02:55.600 --> 02:58.350
to ferry astronauts to the
International Space Station.

03:02.487 --> 03:03.590
Do we have any idea what he wants?

03:03.590 --> 03:07.010
No. Just wanted, more
like demanded a meeting.

03:07.010 --> 03:09.307
- And he flew from Colorado to Brussels?

03:09.307 --> 03:10.657
- Well, it must be important.

03:12.020 --> 03:12.853
- Bill?

03:12.853 --> 03:13.686
- Yes, Madam President.

03:13.686 --> 03:14.950
- I need a moment.

03:21.010 --> 03:22.780
You want to start with this one, sir?

03:22.780 --> 03:25.030
Yes. And the rest can
follow in this order.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.410
- Coffee, Major?

03:27.410 --> 03:30.056
- Oh no. Thank you,
sir. I am fully leaded.

03:32.410 --> 03:35.123
Sir, do you think she'll believe us?

03:36.441 --> 03:39.097
- Believe? Well, that's a good question.

03:39.097 --> 03:43.271
But no matter what she believes
it won't change the facts.

03:43.271 --> 03:44.610
Have you met the president?

03:44.610 --> 03:45.670
- No, sir. I haven't.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.580
I almost did when she
came to inspect Vandenberg

03:47.580 --> 03:48.850
last month.

03:48.850 --> 03:52.410
- Ah yes. Her surprise base inspections.

03:52.410 --> 03:54.430
They aren't going as well as you'd think

03:54.430 --> 03:55.350
- Sir?

03:55.350 --> 03:56.183
- Oh, forget it.

03:59.430 --> 04:00.970
Just a word of advice.

04:00.970 --> 04:03.110
Colton uses Seward as a Pit Bull.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.290
If she asks you a direct question,

04:05.290 --> 04:07.400
you give her a complete answer.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.610
The last thing you wanna do

04:08.610 --> 04:10.110
is get into a debate with her.

04:10.110 --> 04:11.220
Trust me.

04:11.220 --> 04:12.150
- Understood, sir.

04:12.150 --> 04:13.297
Well, anyone else-

04:14.990 --> 04:17.538
- Excuse me. Who are you?

04:18.371 --> 04:22.290
You must be General
Reager and Major Sampson.

04:22.290 --> 04:23.910
- This is a closed door meeting.

04:23.910 --> 04:26.210
- Yes. The door is closed.

04:26.210 --> 04:29.070
I'm Cedric Yonah and
this is James Griffin.

04:29.070 --> 04:33.300
- Well, excuse me, Mr. Yonah,
what is your purpose here?

04:33.300 --> 04:35.170
- General, when I was
advised at this meeting,

04:35.170 --> 04:37.410
my colleague and I were asked to attend.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.140
- And who was that?

04:39.140 --> 04:39.973
- Who was, what?

04:39.973 --> 04:42.120
- Who asked you to attend?

04:42.120 --> 04:45.560
- General, Major, let's no
get off on the wrong foot,

04:45.560 --> 04:46.637
shall we?

04:46.637 --> 04:48.580
You know as well as I, that on occasion,

04:48.580 --> 04:50.943
outside experts are called in to assist.

04:57.270 --> 04:58.426
- Madam President.

04:59.510 --> 05:02.020
- General Reager, I haven't seen you

05:02.020 --> 05:03.950
since that Navstar
launch of Cape Canaveral.

05:03.950 --> 05:05.060
How's the Directorate?

05:05.060 --> 05:08.310
- As always, Madam President, 100%.

05:08.310 --> 05:10.940
Oh, I'd like you to meet
Major Ellen Sampson.

05:10.940 --> 05:12.320
- Ah, Major Sampson, a pleasure.

05:12.320 --> 05:13.477
- Likewise, Madam President.

05:13.477 --> 05:14.760
- And where were you stationed?

05:14.760 --> 05:16.830
- Space and Missile Systems, El Segundo.

05:16.830 --> 05:18.810
- Ah, I should figure when old
John here called a meeting,

05:18.810 --> 05:20.340
that space would factor into it.

05:20.340 --> 05:21.173
Welcome.

05:21.173 --> 05:22.513
- Thank you, Madam President.

05:22.513 --> 05:24.210
- Forgive me Madam President,

05:24.210 --> 05:27.050
but I thought this was going
to be a closed meeting.

05:27.050 --> 05:30.640
- Oh, my dear General, you know
my policy, always a witness

05:30.640 --> 05:33.230
or in this case, an expert or two.

05:33.230 --> 05:34.760
And of course, you both
know Elisabeth Seward,

05:34.760 --> 05:36.740
my National Security Advisor.

05:36.740 --> 05:37.573
- Elisabeth.

05:37.573 --> 05:38.406
- Ma'am.

05:38.406 --> 05:39.790
- General, Major.

05:39.790 --> 05:42.390
Elisabeth, perhaps you could
introduce our other two guests,

05:42.390 --> 05:43.223
although it looked like

05:43.223 --> 05:45.960
you were all exchanging
pleasantries when we walked in.

05:45.960 --> 05:46.880
- Of a sort.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.620
- General, Major, this is Cedric Yonah,

05:49.620 --> 05:53.050
science attache to the
president and James Griffin,

05:53.050 --> 05:55.890
who was with JPL and now the
Shinar Center of Science.

05:55.890 --> 05:58.090
- Oh yes, the DC think
tank behind the upgrades

05:58.090 --> 06:00.082
to the Deep Space Network.

06:00.082 --> 06:01.360
- The very one, Major.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.780
No point in launching satellites

06:02.780 --> 06:04.350
if we can't communicate with them.

06:05.288 --> 06:06.906
- Agreed.

06:06.906 --> 06:10.989
- Yonah. Yonah, that's
Hebrew for dove, isn't it?

06:12.253 --> 06:13.086
- It is.

06:14.650 --> 06:16.310
- Well, now that we're all introduced,

06:16.310 --> 06:17.780
General, this is your bailiwick.

06:17.780 --> 06:20.010
I can give you just about an hour.

06:20.010 --> 06:21.150
- Thank you, Madam president

06:21.150 --> 06:22.800
if you would all take your seats.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.410
- That's a pretty old school setup

06:35.410 --> 06:37.550
for this level of briefing.

06:37.550 --> 06:39.180
- Old-school?

06:39.180 --> 06:40.960
A Faraday shield is protecting this room

06:40.960 --> 06:43.800
and the adjacent hallway
from electromagnetic fields.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.970
- Wow. That explains
why the Secret Service

06:45.970 --> 06:49.020
confiscated our cell phones
before we entered the elevator.

06:49.020 --> 06:51.850
But there will be a
record of this meeting.

06:51.850 --> 06:54.580
Simply put, there's a hole
in the president's schedule

06:54.580 --> 06:56.230
because she's here.

06:56.230 --> 06:57.350
How long do you think it will take

06:57.350 --> 07:00.130
before some intrepid reporter
starts asking questions

07:00.130 --> 07:02.820
that I'm just gonna guess
you don't want answered.

07:02.820 --> 07:04.950
- Ma'am the answer is simple.

07:04.950 --> 07:06.620
The Commander of Air Force Space Command

07:06.620 --> 07:09.220
requested an emergency
meeting with the president

07:10.137 --> 07:11.320
- And as Commander,

07:11.320 --> 07:14.350
I must protest the presence
of these two civilians.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.760
They're not part of my command.

07:15.760 --> 07:20.324
- No. They're part of mine.
Shall we get on with it?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.373
- Of course, Madam President. Major.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.890
This point in space is
known as Lagrange Point Two.

07:31.890 --> 07:34.920
Just about 1 million miles from Earth.

07:34.920 --> 07:39.230
This is one of five such celestial
points relative to Earth,

07:39.230 --> 07:40.860
but is the Lagrange Point Two

07:40.860 --> 07:43.793
that observes the Earth, Moon and Sun.

07:44.970 --> 07:47.280
They're called parking places in space

07:48.116 --> 07:50.120
because the combined gravitational forces

07:50.120 --> 07:54.330
of all three bodies create
a place of equilibrium.

07:54.330 --> 07:56.800
So a satellite can literally park there

07:56.800 --> 07:58.863
and make observations.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.080
- Madam President, when
the James Webb Telescope

08:02.080 --> 08:05.093
launches in 2019, it'll
be parked at this point.

08:05.950 --> 08:07.233
Sorry, General.

08:09.270 --> 08:10.933
- Please tell me you
didn't request this meeting

08:10.933 --> 08:12.810
to give me a science lesson.

08:12.810 --> 08:15.773
- No, Madam president. Next slide.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.220
You mentioned the Directorate earlier.

08:21.220 --> 08:24.990
As you know, the Directorate
overseas GPS launch, military

08:24.990 --> 08:29.550
and other highly classified communications

08:29.550 --> 08:31.773
for the Department of Defense.

08:32.920 --> 08:34.920
You're looking at a Milstar satellite

08:34.920 --> 08:37.440
in geostationary orbit.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.423
And that orbit is about
24,000 miles from earth.

08:42.300 --> 08:44.120
As you may know, Madam President,

08:44.120 --> 08:47.280
we have five of these military
communication satellites

08:47.280 --> 08:48.113
in orbit.

08:49.790 --> 08:54.790
On August 15 last year, this
satellite intercepted a signal

08:55.210 --> 08:57.723
that originated from Lagrange Point Two.

08:59.030 --> 09:01.660
At first, our concern was
that someone was trying

09:01.660 --> 09:02.733
to hack into Milstar,

09:04.020 --> 09:07.585
but at the time that
didn't seem to be the case.

09:07.585 --> 09:08.660
- Why is that?

09:10.310 --> 09:13.320
- The only satellite operating in LG2

09:13.320 --> 09:17.253
is a European Space Agency
space observatory called, Gaia.

09:18.260 --> 09:21.647
And it's not configured to
communicate with Milstar.

09:22.508 --> 09:24.008
- Then what was it?

09:25.885 --> 09:27.360
- Another satellite.

09:32.597 --> 09:35.200
- But you just said that the
only one operating there was...

09:36.165 --> 09:37.260
- Gaia.

09:37.260 --> 09:38.110
- Yes. Thank you.

09:39.050 --> 09:41.140
- Who intercepted the signal?

09:41.140 --> 09:41.973
- My unit did

09:42.950 --> 09:45.190
- Sure. It wasn't an Earth-based
signal that reflected

09:45.190 --> 09:47.270
off some piece of space debris?

09:47.270 --> 09:48.360
- Positive.

09:48.360 --> 09:51.070
- Major, science isn't about positives.

09:51.070 --> 09:54.800
It's about a probable set of
conclusions based on facts.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.760
- Emissions from a neutron star?

09:56.760 --> 09:58.420
- Negative.

09:58.420 --> 09:59.253
- Comment?

10:00.690 --> 10:01.523
- Negative.

10:01.523 --> 10:03.560
This signal was in the upper band

10:03.560 --> 10:05.830
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

10:05.830 --> 10:06.663
- What part?

10:06.663 --> 10:08.210
X-ray, and before you tell me

10:08.210 --> 10:10.160
it's not possible scientifically,

10:10.160 --> 10:12.380
you know, as well as I,
that NASA has been looking

10:12.380 --> 10:14.420
into X-ray transmissions.

10:14.420 --> 10:15.840
- But it's not NASA.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.240
- No, and it's not the Europeans.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.960
- But this signal could be faked.

10:20.960 --> 10:25.960
- Sure. If there was a
transmitter 900 AUs from Earth,

10:26.120 --> 10:30.130
but considering Voyager 1 is
just over 100 AUs from Earth,

10:30.130 --> 10:31.860
I would say it's unlikely.

10:31.860 --> 10:33.570
- Look, this could be Russia, China,

10:33.570 --> 10:34.730
hell, it could be Iran, for all we know.

10:34.730 --> 10:36.910
- Madam President, With all due respect,

10:36.910 --> 10:38.210
there isn't a satellite launch

10:38.210 --> 10:40.763
from this planet that we don't know about.

11:08.629 --> 11:12.150
- General, what exactly
are you trying to tell me?

11:14.220 --> 11:15.053
Madam President,

11:24.620 --> 11:28.400
it was a satellite of
extraterrestrial origin.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.120
- Dear God.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.090
General, how did you get this picture?

12:13.090 --> 12:14.460
- Yes, how did you?

12:14.460 --> 12:16.450
Satellites are next to
impossible to image?

12:16.450 --> 12:18.820
there's virtually no ambient light in space.

12:18.820 --> 12:21.290
- To be frank, we got very lucky.

12:21.290 --> 12:23.640
Major, do we have a slide of the X-37?

12:23.640 --> 12:24.840
- Yes sir. I believe so.

12:26.700 --> 12:27.750
- We're being watched

12:28.590 --> 12:30.510
So it would it seem.

12:30.510 --> 12:32.360
- But by who or what?

12:32.360 --> 12:34.410
- Madam President, if I may,

12:34.410 --> 12:37.720
just bring us all back
to Earth for a moment.

12:37.720 --> 12:40.500
Since the Soviet Union
launched Sputnik in 1957

12:40.500 --> 12:42.150
there have been over what?

12:42.150 --> 12:45.230
6,000 satellites launched into space?

12:45.230 --> 12:47.610
This predates the National
Reconnaissance Office

12:47.610 --> 12:50.183
and the Space Surveillance Networks.

12:50.183 --> 12:52.030
I agree with the general
that the United States tracks

12:52.030 --> 12:55.554
all watches from around the
world now, but in the 1960s,

12:55.554 --> 12:57.910
'70s, even '80s,

12:57.910 --> 13:00.423
come on, it wasn't technically
possible back then.

13:02.270 --> 13:03.330
- I had no idea you were such

13:03.330 --> 13:05.380
a historian on space, Elisabeth.

13:05.380 --> 13:08.020
- That's why I'm here. I briefed her.

13:08.020 --> 13:08.853
- Oh, did you?

13:09.870 --> 13:10.703
Interesting.

13:12.270 --> 13:13.103
- Ready, sir.

13:14.010 --> 13:14.960
- Thank you, Major.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.420
Madam President,

13:17.420 --> 13:20.193
you're familiar with the
Boeing X-37 space plane.

13:25.560 --> 13:27.450
On the day of discovery,

13:27.450 --> 13:30.233
this plane was on its second test flight.

13:32.820 --> 13:37.820
On my order, I sent the plane to the LG2

13:38.940 --> 13:40.403
where the signal originated,

13:41.620 --> 13:44.183
with on-board lights and cameras,

13:45.740 --> 13:48.210
the following images were produced.

13:48.210 --> 13:50.670
- Well, thank you for confirming
the rumored EM drive,

13:50.670 --> 13:51.920
but that still doesn't confirm

13:51.920 --> 13:53.780
that it's extra terrestrial in origin.

13:53.780 --> 13:54.970
- Oh, it does.

13:54.970 --> 13:58.100
When the satellite engages
its engine and leave quickly.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.651
We haven't been able to track it since.

14:00.651 --> 14:02.490
- Then all you have, General is a picture

14:02.490 --> 14:05.798
that could lend itself to
a science fiction story.

14:05.798 --> 14:09.320
Mr. Science Attache,

14:09.320 --> 14:12.420
in addition to the X-ray
transmission that we have,

14:12.420 --> 14:17.420
the X- 37 also recorded some
very interesting readings.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.523
- What kind?

14:18.523 --> 14:20.140
- Propulsion.

14:20.140 --> 14:24.483
Yes, we have an experimental
ION drive on the X-37,

14:25.490 --> 14:29.440
but that pales in comparison
to the anti-gravity drive

14:29.440 --> 14:30.573
on the satellite.

14:31.900 --> 14:36.900
So we're no longer in the
world of science fiction,

14:37.570 --> 14:42.400
but fact, and the fact
remains Madam President,

14:42.400 --> 14:45.520
that a satellite of
extra terrestrial origin

14:45.520 --> 14:47.630
was discovered at LG2

14:47.630 --> 14:50.590
with communication and
propulsion technologies

14:50.590 --> 14:53.373
that do not exist on Earth.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.560
- Who else knows about this?

15:02.960 --> 15:05.400
- Aside from those in this room,

15:05.400 --> 15:08.140
only a handful of techs
from Sampson's unit

15:09.090 --> 15:10.263
and Senator Hadrian.

15:11.570 --> 15:16.570
The signal telemetry and
mission records of the X-37

15:16.710 --> 15:19.168
are now controlled by my office.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.930
- You know, if Sorenson
finds out about this

15:20.930 --> 15:23.650
or any of these other
alien disclosure groups

15:23.650 --> 15:25.010
were in of it.

15:25.010 --> 15:25.980
- Sorenson?

15:25.980 --> 15:27.750
- Oh, a political activist that heads up

15:27.750 --> 15:29.640
Solar Research Group.

15:29.640 --> 15:31.290
He tried putting pressure on the president

15:31.290 --> 15:33.210
to disclose what she knew about UFOs

15:33.210 --> 15:37.400
or more precisely, the extra
terrestrial presence issue.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.050
- Christ, I need some coffee.

15:39.050 --> 15:40.003
Let's take five.

15:49.290 --> 15:51.100
- Government has painted
itself into a real corner

15:51.100 --> 15:52.970
with this UFO matter.

15:52.970 --> 15:56.860
Damned if they say something.
Damned if they don't.

15:56.860 --> 15:59.221
They only believe what they see.

15:59.221 --> 16:00.971
- It doesn't matter. It's academic.

16:02.510 --> 16:05.560
- Do you think Reager will
be a help or a hindrance?

16:05.560 --> 16:09.113
- Please, he is a career
military officer on a mission.

16:10.860 --> 16:12.610
Which actually it gives me an idea.

16:14.430 --> 16:17.067
- What's your impression of the president?

16:19.557 --> 16:22.307
- If I dint know any better,
sir, I'd say she's scared.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.543
- Aren't you? Hell, aren't we all?

16:26.389 --> 16:29.470
With all that we know, we should
have seen this one coming.

16:29.470 --> 16:30.927
Keep your eye on Cedric.

16:33.710 --> 16:36.243
- That's not hard sir.
He's keeping them on me.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.620
- If an opportunity
presents itself, take it.

16:45.620 --> 16:47.520
We need to know more about him.

16:53.393 --> 16:54.430
- I just can't believe this.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.061
- Neither can I.

16:58.420 --> 16:59.930
- What would your advice be?

16:59.930 --> 17:01.764
- Well, whatever happens,

17:01.764 --> 17:03.770
there's only one thing
you have to remember,

17:03.770 --> 17:05.546
you're the president.

17:18.180 --> 17:21.640
- Madam President, it was
truly an honor to meet you,

17:21.640 --> 17:22.890
but I must beg to leave.

17:22.890 --> 17:23.750
I have a flight today.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.150
- Oh, I'm sorry to see you go.

17:25.150 --> 17:27.520
I've enjoyed your commentary on this,

17:27.520 --> 17:28.870
what are we calling it?

17:28.870 --> 17:31.270
Development or discovery?

17:31.270 --> 17:32.370
- Revelation.

17:32.370 --> 17:33.750
- That's as good a word as any.

17:33.750 --> 17:34.990
James, I'd like you to stay in touch

17:34.990 --> 17:36.210
with Elisabeth's office.

17:36.210 --> 17:38.210
I might have some follow-up
questions for you.

17:38.210 --> 17:39.850
- Of course, Madam President.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.983
- Leaving in the middle of
a presidential briefing.

17:44.860 --> 17:46.120
- I thought you'd be happy, General.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.400
- What could possibly be more important?

17:48.400 --> 17:51.517
- You know the old adage,
ask me no questions,

17:51.517 --> 17:53.750
- And I'll tell you no lies.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.280
- Imagine if we did that in Washington

17:56.280 --> 18:00.290
- Mr. Griffin, I do want to remind you,

18:00.290 --> 18:01.803
this meeting is classified.

18:04.090 --> 18:07.630
- General, you have my word that no one

18:07.630 --> 18:09.163
on this planet will know.

18:11.500 --> 18:16.500
Madam President, Madam Advisor, General, Major.

18:16.830 --> 18:18.330
- Safe travels.

18:36.290 --> 18:39.313
- Bill, I need to get to the
field as quickly as possible.

18:39.313 --> 18:40.372
Yes, sir.

18:55.690 --> 18:57.920
- General, forgive the obvious,

18:57.920 --> 19:00.020
you discovered this alleged alien-

19:00.020 --> 19:02.730
- There's nothing alleged about it.

19:02.730 --> 19:05.200
- You don't mind if I finish, do you?

19:05.200 --> 19:08.300
You discovered this
satellite on August 15th,

19:08.300 --> 19:11.040
why are we just hearing
about this now on June 4th,

19:11.040 --> 19:12.750
nearly a year after this incident?

19:12.750 --> 19:14.480
- And why brief Senator Hadrian,

19:14.480 --> 19:17.360
the Chairman of the Senate
Committee of Armed Services

19:17.360 --> 19:18.673
before the president?

19:19.840 --> 19:21.390
- They make a point, John.

19:21.390 --> 19:23.173
I'd like an answer before you continue.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.720
- To be frank Madam President,

19:25.720 --> 19:27.080
we needed to be certain

19:27.080 --> 19:28.610
there was something to brief you on

19:28.610 --> 19:32.130
and to compartmentalize
the entire operation.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.950
- You mean hide from inquiry?

19:33.950 --> 19:35.913
- I mean keep it from the public.

19:36.890 --> 19:38.340
That's why I went to Hadrian.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.060
Do you think it's a good idea

19:41.060 --> 19:43.290
for the public to know about this?

19:43.290 --> 19:46.993
Do you? They can barely
handle bad weather.

19:48.450 --> 19:52.280
That's the one downside
of a democracy disclosure

19:53.220 --> 19:56.053
for some things that
just can't be disclosed,

19:57.840 --> 20:01.440
and to ensure compliance
with any ridiculous

20:01.440 --> 20:04.053
Freedom of Information Act requests,

20:05.160 --> 20:08.903
the documentation has been
removed from government files.

20:10.770 --> 20:13.030
Call it what you want.

20:13.030 --> 20:16.533
I call it, protecting the
people from themselves.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.683
And before you utter one more word,

20:21.020 --> 20:23.280
the president will agree with me on this.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.370
- He's right, Elisabeth.

20:27.370 --> 20:28.850
There are just some matters of state

20:28.850 --> 20:30.050
that can't be disclosed.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.300
Speaking of disclosure,

20:33.300 --> 20:35.620
I'd like to know where Mr.
Griffin went in such a hurry,

20:35.620 --> 20:36.970
given his background

20:36.970 --> 20:39.290
and the subject matter
that we're talking about.

20:39.290 --> 20:41.783
Don't you find it odd
that he left so abruptly?

20:44.870 --> 20:45.703
- Very well.

20:46.825 --> 20:48.750
He went to the European
Space Operations Center

20:48.750 --> 20:49.850
in Darmstadt, Germany.

20:50.770 --> 20:52.590
We want to know if the Gaia observatory

20:52.590 --> 20:53.890
reported anything unusual.

20:55.580 --> 20:56.990
We would've told you Madam President,

20:56.990 --> 20:59.510
but we didn't want any
military interference.

20:59.510 --> 21:01.520
- You're gonna have more than military-

21:01.520 --> 21:02.840
- General, I'm satisfied.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.360
Let's all secure from Defcon 3, shall we?

21:05.360 --> 21:07.670
- It's a prudent action.

21:07.670 --> 21:09.120
Albeit a bit underhanded.

21:10.530 --> 21:13.880
- So you haven't been able
to track this satellite?

21:13.880 --> 21:15.370
- Not the satellite itself.

21:15.370 --> 21:16.471
- But I thought the satellite-

21:16.471 --> 21:17.804
- Communication.

21:21.940 --> 21:24.420
After we ruled out a hack of Milstar,

21:24.420 --> 21:27.590
we believe it came down to line of sight,

21:27.590 --> 21:30.300
and that our satellite
simply got in the way.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.050
- How did you possibly come
up with that conclusion?

21:33.050 --> 21:36.220
- Our satellites don't communicate
the X-ray transmission.

21:36.220 --> 21:39.070
Our satellite simply
recorded what it received

21:39.070 --> 21:42.110
or more precisely what passed through it.

21:42.110 --> 21:44.300
- But that still doesn't prove
your line of sight theory.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.260
- It doesn't disprove it either.

21:46.260 --> 21:48.630
It's a theory for many deductions.

21:48.630 --> 21:51.350
Fact, no satellite launched from Earth

21:51.350 --> 21:53.590
whether military or civilian communicates

21:53.590 --> 21:55.440
via X-ray transmissions.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.570
Fact, the signal terminated
over the Atlantic Ocean.

21:59.570 --> 22:03.570
Fact, no military or civilian
aircraft, surface ships,

22:03.570 --> 22:05.280
or submarines were anywhere near

22:05.280 --> 22:07.140
the termination of the signal.

22:07.140 --> 22:08.890
So where does that leave us?

22:08.890 --> 22:10.380
- Your tell us, Major.

22:10.380 --> 22:13.250
- You're familiar with Arthur Conan Doyle.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.253
- Of course.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.990
- Once you eliminate the impossible,

22:17.990 --> 22:22.823
what remains no matter how
improbable, must be the truth.

22:24.490 --> 22:25.723
Laugh all you want.

22:26.570 --> 22:29.540
Madam President, we strongly
believe that this satellite

22:29.540 --> 22:31.440
was communicating with something that,

22:32.470 --> 22:34.940
well, something that we just can't see

22:34.940 --> 22:37.250
because the fact remains that a signal

22:37.250 --> 22:39.740
must be received by something.

22:39.740 --> 22:42.500
The fact that we can't
see it does not mean

22:42.500 --> 22:43.880
that it doesn't exist.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.530
- Your conclusion is ridiculous.

22:45.530 --> 22:48.540
- Not nearly as ridiculous
as your deliberate dismissal.

22:48.540 --> 22:51.370
You're supposed to be the
National Security Adviser.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.870
Aren't you the least bit
concerned about this?

22:53.870 --> 22:56.480
- I'm concerned that Russia,

22:56.480 --> 22:59.310
a member of the United
Nations Security Council

22:59.310 --> 23:02.460
has invaded the Crimea and the
president should be talking

23:02.460 --> 23:03.710
to her allies upstairs

23:03.710 --> 23:07.370
rather than listening to
fantasy downstairs, okay?

23:07.370 --> 23:10.170
I'm concerned that you are
wasting the president's time,

23:10.170 --> 23:11.860
but hey, look, I get it.

23:11.860 --> 23:12.693
You have a picture

23:12.693 --> 23:13.910
and a signal and you think that-

23:13.910 --> 23:15.210
- Major, excuse me.

23:15.210 --> 23:18.010
You are also painfully, aware
that X-ray can originate

23:18.010 --> 23:21.410
from a supernova, other space phenomenon?

23:21.410 --> 23:24.363
- But it does come down
to modulation, doesn't it?

23:25.320 --> 23:29.403
A supernova isn't trying to communicate.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.490
You also know, or maybe you don't,

23:32.490 --> 23:35.740
that NASA has been experimenting
with this technology.

23:35.740 --> 23:38.700
Madam President, if NASA is successful,

23:38.700 --> 23:40.900
the result will be high-rates of data

23:40.900 --> 23:43.170
transmitted over vast distances of space

23:43.170 --> 23:46.060
and the ability to communicate
with hypersonic vehicles

23:46.060 --> 23:47.960
during atmosphere, free entry.

23:47.960 --> 23:52.040
Mr. Griffith would confirm
all this, but he's, oh yes,

23:52.040 --> 23:52.993
he's left for ESOC.

23:54.810 --> 23:58.010
- General, have you decoded
these transmissions?

23:58.010 --> 23:59.180
- This is why it's taken so long

23:59.180 --> 24:01.153
to bring this to your attention.

24:02.360 --> 24:03.697
I'll take over, Major.

24:06.540 --> 24:09.220
Madam President, what
I'm about to disclose

24:09.220 --> 24:13.670
has a NATO security classification as CTS,

24:13.670 --> 24:15.683
it's Cosmic Top Secret.

24:16.810 --> 24:18.543
High security rating possible.

24:19.800 --> 24:22.810
Before I continue, I
need your authorization

24:22.810 --> 24:26.750
to declassify this information to him.

24:26.750 --> 24:28.830
- I have more clearance
that you can possibly know.

24:28.830 --> 24:30.296
- Not with me, you don't.

24:30.296 --> 24:31.897
- Madam President, a moment.

24:41.216 --> 24:42.730
Reager knows that Cedric is in this room

24:42.730 --> 24:45.840
he has all necessary
clearances, why ask you?

24:45.840 --> 24:47.710
- He wants to know
where my alliances fall.

24:47.710 --> 24:48.770
He's plotting something.

24:48.770 --> 24:52.336
What, I don't know yet, but
body language speaks volumes.

24:52.336 --> 24:53.169
Reager wants something.

24:53.169 --> 24:55.084
- And Cedric wants to know what.

24:55.084 --> 24:58.670
- We need to find out where this is going.

24:58.670 --> 25:01.961
General, you have my authorization.

25:06.030 --> 25:07.200
- The planet Earth

25:08.520 --> 25:11.620
designated the Blue
Marble during Apollo 17.

25:11.620 --> 25:12.570
Stunning, isn't it?

25:14.120 --> 25:15.090
But here's what you have to know

25:15.090 --> 25:16.503
if you plan to land on it.

25:18.750 --> 25:22.543
There are presently over
3,500 satellites in orbit.

25:23.970 --> 25:28.110
We are tracking over 500,000 pieces

25:28.110 --> 25:30.240
of orbital debris.

25:30.240 --> 25:35.133
Now this traffic is traveling
at 17,000 miles per hour.

25:36.970 --> 25:41.090
in Earth's atmosphere, civilian
and military flight tracking

25:41.090 --> 25:42.493
is just as important.

25:43.410 --> 25:48.330
This year alone, there will
be over 100,000 civilian flights

25:48.330 --> 25:50.440
around the world.

25:50.440 --> 25:54.270
The Military, NATO, ESA

25:54.270 --> 25:58.590
and other civilian and commercial
partners have to navigate

25:58.590 --> 26:02.303
this traffic for more
reasons than I can count.

26:04.270 --> 26:07.273
Apparently, so to those
that control this satellite.

26:08.540 --> 26:11.120
- What exactly are you saying, General?

26:11.120 --> 26:12.033
- Navigation.

26:13.290 --> 26:15.620
This satellite wasn't
just observing earth.

26:15.620 --> 26:17.440
It was communicating in the same way

26:17.440 --> 26:20.633
that we communicate with
our spacecraft and aircraft.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.060
It wasn't just imagery, either.

26:24.060 --> 26:28.887
Transponder codes for all
civilian and military satellites

26:28.887 --> 26:30.713
and aircraft were recorded.

26:31.730 --> 26:34.093
There were also weather
forecasting models.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.623
We also found what we
believe to be a flight plan,

26:39.560 --> 26:42.403
leaving from the Atlantic
ocean and off the planet.

26:43.820 --> 26:44.703
- A flight plan?

26:45.900 --> 26:47.400
- Where did the plan track to?

26:48.290 --> 26:49.340
- That we don't know.

26:50.390 --> 26:52.140
- Something isn't just watching us,

26:54.190 --> 26:55.240
they're already here.

26:57.530 --> 26:58.363
- Precisely.

26:59.820 --> 27:01.728
- It's curious, isn't it?

27:01.728 --> 27:03.010
- What is?

27:03.010 --> 27:03.843
- This.

27:10.460 --> 27:13.200
Governments spends billions
on space exploration

27:13.200 --> 27:16.000
in the search for extra terrestrial life.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.480
Earth scientists have discovered nearly 1000

27:18.480 --> 27:21.633
extra solar planets, some
in the habitable zone.

27:23.170 --> 27:25.080
Radio telescopes, beaming and beaming,

27:25.080 --> 27:26.493
hoping to make contact.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.170
And what happens?

27:29.170 --> 27:31.300
You discover they're right here.

27:31.300 --> 27:33.460
Congratulations. You can
both add another medal

27:33.460 --> 27:34.630
to your fruit salads.

27:34.630 --> 27:36.425
- Excuse me. That's disrespectful.

27:36.425 --> 27:38.870
- Cedric, the General and
Major are decorated officers

27:38.870 --> 27:40.460
with a track record of outstanding-

27:40.460 --> 27:43.050
- Madam President forgive
me. I mean, no disrespect.

27:43.050 --> 27:44.800
It's a compliment to your command.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.890
- Well, then compliment us
with your scientific insight

27:47.890 --> 27:49.593
on what we may be dealing with.

27:50.810 --> 27:52.820
- There are many insights we could make.

27:52.820 --> 27:55.510
Just looking at the configuration
and size of the satellite

27:55.510 --> 27:58.250
means that there could be a
similarity to Earth's development

27:58.250 --> 28:00.770
in terms of communications.

28:00.770 --> 28:04.200
Anti gravity propulsion
though, that's a revolution.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.663
If in fact the X-37 readings were correct.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.610
It means the propulsion can be achieved

28:09.610 --> 28:11.750
at near light, speed in space.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.490
And on planets like Earth.

28:13.490 --> 28:15.230
Gravity cancellation technology

28:15.230 --> 28:19.340
would make conventional
airports and airplanes obsolete.

28:19.340 --> 28:21.470
In essence, picture a helicopter

28:21.470 --> 28:23.733
without the need for rotating blades.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.100
Now, if such a satellite were to originate

28:27.100 --> 28:28.530
from another solar system,

28:28.530 --> 28:33.243
it could be one nearby, say
Gliese or Promixa Centauri.

28:35.190 --> 28:36.890
Ask anyone who has worked in this field

28:36.890 --> 28:38.730
and they'll tell you
the navigation of space

28:38.730 --> 28:41.200
is complicated and dangerous.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.580
It looks empty to the lay person,

28:42.580 --> 28:45.230
but in fact is littered with
debris like Earth orbit.

28:46.750 --> 28:49.260
Now for a long extended
journey they would need

28:49.260 --> 28:52.690
or at least want something along the lines

28:52.690 --> 28:55.230
of asteroid deflectors for starters.

28:55.230 --> 28:56.630
- Asteroid deflectors?

28:56.630 --> 28:58.410
- Yes, devices that fly apart,

28:58.410 --> 29:00.830
but in concert with the
primary space vehicle

29:00.830 --> 29:03.330
to repel, deflect or
even destroy space debris

29:03.330 --> 29:05.920
that poses a threat to navigation.

29:05.920 --> 29:08.950
NASA is working on a plan
now to install laser cannons

29:08.950 --> 29:11.203
on the ISS for just such debris.

29:13.130 --> 29:15.080
It's a shame the satellite disappeared.

29:16.210 --> 29:18.860
Imagine the knowledge, if
it was reversed engineered.

29:19.770 --> 29:21.240
Of course, there's one
thing you can't tell

29:21.240 --> 29:23.600
from these images or
even the transmission.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.900
- And what's that?

29:24.900 --> 29:27.490
- How long the satellite
has been an orbit.

29:27.490 --> 29:30.170
Could be one year. It could be 100.

29:30.170 --> 29:32.020
It could be a thousand.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.330
My point is, wherever they're from,

29:34.330 --> 29:36.690
regardless of what they look like,

29:36.690 --> 29:40.033
they are an advanced
civilization, but not infallible.

29:43.390 --> 29:46.310
- The comm signal that
passed through our satellite.

29:46.310 --> 29:47.143
- Exactly.

29:49.090 --> 29:50.590
- What do you think they want?

29:51.470 --> 29:52.930
- You don't need to be a
scientist to answer that,

29:52.930 --> 29:54.413
Madam President.

29:54.413 --> 29:56.340
I would postulate the
same thing NASA wants

29:56.340 --> 29:58.793
when new horizons
intercepts Pluto next year.

30:00.290 --> 30:01.123
- Answers.

30:03.270 --> 30:05.603
- Answers are something
that we need, Cedric.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.603
So where do we go from here, General?

30:13.820 --> 30:17.847
- It's not where we go. It's where we are.

30:19.880 --> 30:22.340
Using our military satellite networks

30:22.340 --> 30:24.640
in cooperation with other nations

30:24.640 --> 30:27.470
and ground stations around the world,

30:27.470 --> 30:30.960
I've assembled a team of
scientists and engineers

30:30.960 --> 30:33.490
and various agencies to detect

30:33.490 --> 30:35.523
and track this alien presence.

30:37.018 --> 30:40.820
But our present funding and
certain inter-agency rules

30:40.820 --> 30:42.780
prohibit us from taking this further.

30:43.970 --> 30:47.470
I need your authorization
to divert funding

30:47.470 --> 30:49.930
from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration

30:49.930 --> 30:52.273
Authorization Act of 2014.

30:53.220 --> 30:54.380
This funding will be placed

30:54.380 --> 30:56.460
at the National Reconnaissance Office

30:56.460 --> 30:58.160
and administered by Space Command.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.193
NASA won't ask any questions.

31:02.300 --> 31:05.920
Any budget shortfall will
be handled by Congress

31:05.920 --> 31:07.503
under Senator Hadrian's lead.

31:19.750 --> 31:22.068
Operation Troy, Madam President.

31:33.998 --> 31:35.940
- What are you afraid of, General?

31:35.940 --> 31:37.900
- It's not about being afraid.

31:37.900 --> 31:41.250
It's about knowing who they
are and what they want.

31:41.250 --> 31:43.060
And let us be clear,

31:43.060 --> 31:46.500
nobody undertakes a multi
light year space journey

31:46.500 --> 31:48.550
just because it's Monday.

31:48.550 --> 31:51.097
- That's right, General, a journey.

31:51.097 --> 31:53.230
And you don't know what
they want or who they are.

31:53.230 --> 31:55.330
You are assuming, just
on your actions alone,

31:55.330 --> 31:56.950
they're malevolent.

31:56.950 --> 31:59.960
- And what evidence do
you have that benevolent?

31:59.960 --> 32:02.140
- Have they attacked you? No.

32:02.140 --> 32:04.020
- We don't know that.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.550
We don't know what they're doing here,

32:05.550 --> 32:09.130
but they certainly have some
sort of stealth technology.

32:09.130 --> 32:10.470
- And you don't?

32:10.470 --> 32:12.600
Why do you fly your stealth bombers and drones

32:12.600 --> 32:13.930
to hostile territory?

32:13.930 --> 32:15.100
To protect yourself.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.590
Has it dawned on you that
these, whatever they are,

32:17.590 --> 32:18.640
are doing the same?

32:18.640 --> 32:19.910
- No, it hasn't.

32:19.910 --> 32:23.350
Because in our case, we
know who we're dealing with,

32:23.350 --> 32:24.620
human beings

32:24.620 --> 32:29.200
- Mr. Yonah, this is about
military preparedness.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.870
It's that simple.

32:30.870 --> 32:33.170
We don't know what we're dealing with.

32:33.170 --> 32:36.013
- Exactly. You don't.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.850
This action into the unknown

32:38.850 --> 32:41.450
could seriously put our
national security in jeopardy,

32:41.450 --> 32:43.650
nevermind the security of our planet.

32:43.650 --> 32:46.620
Isn't this the time to act
on fact rather than fiction?

32:46.620 --> 32:49.200
- That's the point, to get some.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.020
We are operating literally in the dark,

32:52.020 --> 32:54.310
the darkness of space.

32:54.310 --> 32:56.440
The whole point of Operation Troy,

32:56.440 --> 32:59.160
is to shed light on this darkness.

32:59.160 --> 33:03.463
- Indeed. This is a time
to study and investigate.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.070
Can you imagine what you
could learn from them?

33:07.070 --> 33:09.680
- All we've learned is
that we're being watched,

33:09.680 --> 33:13.530
and our land air and space
assets are being tracked.

33:13.530 --> 33:15.023
To what end, who knows?

33:16.070 --> 33:18.557
- Would you not agree that this
discovery gives credence to,

33:18.557 --> 33:21.350
"Somewhere, something incredible
is waiting to be known?"

33:21.350 --> 33:24.320
- This isn't the time or
place to quote Carl Sagan.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.210
- That quote is mistakenly
attributed to him.

33:26.210 --> 33:28.310
When in fact it was created by a reporter.

33:29.220 --> 33:30.890
- What's your point, Cedric?

33:30.890 --> 33:32.841
- My point Madam President,

33:32.841 --> 33:35.620
is that in light of the
magnitude of this discovery

33:35.620 --> 33:37.563
it's too easy for mistakes to be made.

33:39.230 --> 33:41.270
- All you scientists are alike.

33:41.270 --> 33:44.210
You deal with the unknown,
but you're remarkably,

33:44.210 --> 33:46.080
predictable in your actions.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.960
- As are you General, you
sadly deal in absolutes

33:48.960 --> 33:50.700
because the unknown terrifies you

33:52.180 --> 33:55.540
- General, if I sign this,

33:55.540 --> 33:57.440
what's the objective of Operation Troy

33:58.890 --> 33:59.863
- Identification.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.970
If they're going to watch
us, we'll return the favor.

34:32.930 --> 34:36.590
The objective is to identify
where they are on this planet.

34:36.590 --> 34:39.263
And if possible, the solar system.

34:40.580 --> 34:43.493
Once identified,
communications will be open.

34:45.410 --> 34:48.560
My concern, Madam President
is despite them being here,

34:48.560 --> 34:51.793
they've made no effort
to communicate with us.

34:53.010 --> 34:56.690
Instead of silent, stealth-like invasion

34:56.690 --> 34:57.853
has already happened.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.300
Just because a bomb hasn't been dropped

35:01.300 --> 35:03.433
does not mean the war has not begun.

35:05.810 --> 35:09.853
So yes, I am afraid.

35:10.830 --> 35:14.280
Afraid of the unknown, as you
should be, Madam President

35:15.315 --> 35:17.730
and everyone else in room.

35:22.773 --> 35:26.630
- Your xenophobia, General
is painfully apparent.

35:26.630 --> 35:29.673
what does Reager stand for?
Something Germanic, isn't it?

35:31.230 --> 35:32.940
How fitting someone with a Germanic name

35:32.940 --> 35:35.000
talks about identifying people?

35:35.000 --> 35:37.320
How fitting such a person
commands a military apparatus.

35:37.320 --> 35:38.850
- How dare you compare me-

35:38.850 --> 35:41.440
- I'm not comparing you
to anyone except yourself.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.330
Unless people like me
speak up loud and often,

35:43.330 --> 35:44.720
and at the moment it matters,

35:44.720 --> 35:47.720
history is a strange
habit of repeating itself.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.400
How many times in the history of mankind

35:49.400 --> 35:51.460
have people been identified
by the fear of others?

35:51.460 --> 35:53.600
How many times have they
been marked by the ignorance

35:53.600 --> 35:55.800
of hate under the
organization of the state?

35:56.680 --> 35:58.600
Those that wouldn't open their eyes,

35:58.600 --> 36:00.120
those that failed to learn,

36:00.120 --> 36:01.710
to make any attempt to understand

36:01.710 --> 36:03.670
that just because you don't know someone

36:03.670 --> 36:05.280
doesn't mean they're your enemy.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.580
They could be your friend.

36:06.580 --> 36:09.540
- A friend doesn't operate in stealth,

36:09.540 --> 36:12.150
there in the open with
a hand of friendship

36:12.150 --> 36:14.240
or at least curiosity.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.630
Not some comm signal,

36:15.630 --> 36:18.800
revealing the identification
of our planes,

36:18.800 --> 36:21.123
our ships and our submarines.

36:22.310 --> 36:26.280
With the exception of
you, everyone in this room

36:26.280 --> 36:27.623
has taken the oath.

36:28.530 --> 36:33.040
It's our job to protect this
country against enemies,

36:33.040 --> 36:35.443
both foreign and domestic.

36:36.550 --> 36:39.500
And if this doesn't qualify as foreign,

36:39.500 --> 36:41.900
you can have all my stars

36:41.900 --> 36:44.773
because that is exactly
where they're from.

36:48.150 --> 36:52.260
And until the day comes
that they reveal themselves

36:52.260 --> 36:54.980
and their intentions to us,

36:54.980 --> 36:58.290
they will be treated as
a cancer in our world.

36:58.290 --> 36:59.323
- And be eradicated.

37:01.440 --> 37:02.960
You're right, General.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.940
I haven't taken an oath

37:04.940 --> 37:06.410
because how many times throughout history

37:06.410 --> 37:09.330
do these oaths end in, "So help me, God."

37:09.330 --> 37:11.220
You may be looking for
a divine intervention

37:11.220 --> 37:12.830
if your plans bear fruit.

37:12.830 --> 37:15.330
This fruit you so longingly
are looking to accomplish

37:15.330 --> 37:17.470
could usher in a new revelation.

37:17.470 --> 37:19.930
Has it even remotely occurred to you,

37:19.930 --> 37:22.680
instead acting on fear of
what you don't understand,

37:22.680 --> 37:24.667
you want to detect,
track and identify them,

37:24.667 --> 37:26.923
and you don't even know what them is.

37:30.840 --> 37:33.290
I'm a man of science and
one could say a history,

37:34.560 --> 37:36.830
when your government enacted
the Indian Removal Act,

37:36.830 --> 37:38.760
it never occurred to President Jackson

37:38.760 --> 37:41.270
that someday the Native Americans
unique place in the world

37:41.270 --> 37:42.630
might be needed.

37:42.630 --> 37:44.500
Thankfully, they and
their language survived

37:44.500 --> 37:46.930
and helped you end a World War.

37:46.930 --> 37:48.310
Has it occurred to you
that whoever they are

37:48.310 --> 37:51.410
it might someday help
you in your hour of need.

37:51.410 --> 37:53.230
Maybe they already are.

37:53.230 --> 37:54.580
Do you want to identify them

37:54.580 --> 37:57.230
because you were scared of
what you don't understand.

37:58.390 --> 38:01.610
If you don't want to understand
space, why look up,

38:01.610 --> 38:03.270
keep your head down.

38:03.270 --> 38:05.620
Thankfully Galileo never did.

38:05.620 --> 38:07.780
But by looking up, he
went against the state.

38:07.780 --> 38:10.790
Not a state of arms, but
a state of mind and beliefs.

38:10.790 --> 38:12.740
Beliefs so distorted centuries later,

38:12.740 --> 38:14.430
that millions would detect track

38:14.430 --> 38:17.860
and identified by a state so
consumed with fear from within

38:17.860 --> 38:19.203
they couldn't see without,

38:20.640 --> 38:23.350
is ironic in so many ways
that you have a space program

38:23.350 --> 38:24.730
that failed state.

38:24.730 --> 38:27.000
A state that is now an ally,

38:27.000 --> 38:28.940
whose Chancellor went before your Congress

38:28.940 --> 38:31.897
and recounted one phrase of the
constitution that proclaims,

38:31.897 --> 38:34.017
"Human dignity shall be inviolable."

38:36.090 --> 38:38.010
Sadly, the action you
are postulating today,

38:38.010 --> 38:40.820
is a violation of the dignity
and the oath you took.

38:40.820 --> 38:43.590
Simply, "There is no price one can set

38:43.590 --> 38:46.510
on the future of humanity
so long as it is tempered

38:46.510 --> 38:48.950
with the best intentions of mankind."

38:48.950 --> 38:51.230
You said those words, Madam
President to your Congress

38:51.230 --> 38:53.983
to fund the space program,
not to militarize it.

38:55.930 --> 38:57.440
I wonder what giant leap for mankind

38:57.440 --> 38:59.890
will be attained if you signed this order.

38:59.890 --> 39:02.556
Indeed, Madam President, the
Trojan horse in this room-

39:02.556 --> 39:03.632
- Sit down.

39:18.132 --> 39:23.132
well, what a
wonderful speech that was,

39:23.640 --> 39:28.640
full of life, perspective
and replete with history,

39:28.800 --> 39:33.623
but not one solid contemporary
idea on what we should do.

39:36.128 --> 39:38.470
The history is littered
with people like you,

39:38.470 --> 39:40.890
all talk and no action.

39:40.890 --> 39:42.940
Neville Chamberlain would have loved you.

39:47.190 --> 39:52.190
But yes, I love this uniform
and what it represents.

39:56.940 --> 40:01.700
And I have no problem,
issue, or reservation

40:01.700 --> 40:05.940
saying that I support and
defend the constitution

40:05.940 --> 40:08.073
of the United States, period.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.660
And if that goes against
your moral standings

40:13.660 --> 40:16.373
and sensibilities, so be it.

40:18.730 --> 40:19.703
That's your right.

40:20.710 --> 40:24.163
Because as an American,
you have that choice.

40:26.140 --> 40:30.883
That's the beauty of the
constitution, freedom of choice.

40:31.990 --> 40:35.603
And if that freedom gets
bloodied along the way, so be it.

40:36.650 --> 40:40.920
But I no longer have the
time, inclination or interest

40:40.920 --> 40:43.173
in debating this with you any longer.

40:46.770 --> 40:49.870
I live in the here and now, not last week

40:49.870 --> 40:51.883
and not seven centuries ago.

40:53.560 --> 40:57.460
And though history may have
some lessons to learn from,

40:57.460 --> 41:00.883
I have no interest in
writing its last chapter.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.800
And I'll be God damned

41:08.800 --> 41:11.003
if something else writes it for us.

41:21.850 --> 41:23.250
Forgive me, Madam President.

41:24.550 --> 41:25.477
What say you?

41:41.240 --> 41:42.290
- It seems odd, does it?

41:43.170 --> 41:46.973
That we are here in a
bunker like wars long past.

41:48.810 --> 41:52.120
But today we decide on a
fate that none of us know

41:53.100 --> 41:54.100
or can even predict.

41:55.770 --> 41:57.530
I've always been a supporter
of the space program,

41:57.530 --> 41:58.363
you know that.

41:59.390 --> 42:02.000
But unlike presidents before me,

42:02.000 --> 42:06.653
I am faced with the revelation
that mankind is not alone.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.470
I have to believe that our intention

42:15.470 --> 42:19.310
has always been one of science,
but let's not kid ourselves.

42:19.310 --> 42:22.920
There's always been a
military component to this,

42:22.920 --> 42:24.623
this next frontier.

42:27.770 --> 42:30.200
This is about the science of anything.

42:30.200 --> 42:33.240
We need to know who or
what we're dealing with

42:33.240 --> 42:35.430
before we can deal with them.

42:35.430 --> 42:37.740
They have the upper hand
of what we don't know,

42:37.740 --> 42:40.253
but that is something
that we need to know.

42:42.915 --> 42:46.317
It's not about fear, but intelligence.

42:49.580 --> 42:51.260
I think we can all agree that

42:51.260 --> 42:53.060
before the New World was discovered,

42:54.180 --> 42:57.220
all Erikson had was the horizon to look at

42:58.210 --> 42:59.577
and it stars to guide him,

43:01.610 --> 43:03.790
but we need to know what the beyond this horizon,

43:04.830 --> 43:07.653
and why out of over 200 billions stars,

43:09.230 --> 43:10.380
they were guided to us.

43:24.149 --> 43:27.681
I'm sorry, it's this world first.

44:42.213 --> 44:43.213
God help us.

45:20.950 --> 45:22.400
- Thank you, Madam President.

45:25.910 --> 45:27.580
For obvious reasons,

45:27.580 --> 45:32.250
updates will not appear on
your daily intelligence brief.

45:32.250 --> 45:34.040
- You can update my
office, General I'll -

45:34.040 --> 45:35.713
- I'll update the president.

45:36.860 --> 45:39.780
- My job as the National
Security Advisor is to-

45:39.780 --> 45:43.550
- Advise the president on
matters of terrestrial security,

45:43.550 --> 45:44.803
not space.

45:51.580 --> 45:52.413
Madam President.

46:19.390 --> 46:21.530
Let's plan to meet when
you get back to Washington,

46:21.530 --> 46:23.570
I'm sure I'll have an update for you then.

46:23.570 --> 46:24.403
- Very good, General.

46:24.403 --> 46:26.130
- Of course, all my best at the G7.

46:26.990 --> 46:30.090
This invasion by the
Russian's not good.

46:30.090 --> 46:32.040
Hard to believe they were once an ally.

46:41.330 --> 46:42.163
Major?

46:42.163 --> 46:42.996
- Yes, sir.

46:42.996 --> 46:44.240
- I'll see you at the briefing.

46:44.240 --> 46:45.073
- Yes sir.

46:46.001 --> 46:47.882
- Madam President.

47:17.360 --> 47:19.390
- Major, I'd like to have that file.

47:19.390 --> 47:20.540
- Yes, Madam President.

47:25.189 --> 47:26.356
- And the USB?

47:27.490 --> 47:29.840
- Madam President, I
don't think I could...

47:29.840 --> 47:31.377
Of course, Madam President.

47:42.070 --> 47:44.373
- How many of us have
dreamed of this moment?

47:45.460 --> 47:47.860
The moment when we learned
that we're not alone?

47:49.498 --> 47:51.620
And what's the first step that we take?

47:51.620 --> 47:52.543
A military one.

47:54.800 --> 47:57.973
History will record the
day I signed this order.

48:00.810 --> 48:02.260
My God, what have I done?

48:02.260 --> 48:05.130
- You've done what is
necessary for the moment

48:05.130 --> 48:06.820
because something tells me the alternative

48:06.820 --> 48:08.900
may have been far worse.

48:08.900 --> 48:11.840
While I don't agree with it,
I understand your decision.

48:11.840 --> 48:14.700
History is replete with moments like this,

48:14.700 --> 48:16.760
but moments are never the whole picture

48:16.760 --> 48:18.060
that is yet to be painted.

48:20.663 --> 48:23.560
- I wish I could share your
spirited optimism, Cedric.

48:23.560 --> 48:26.433
- Optimism is what we
must have, Madam President

48:26.433 --> 48:28.883
so the darkest hour turns
into the brightest day.

48:31.630 --> 48:34.140
- Madam President, it was a
pleasure to meet you today.

48:34.140 --> 48:35.800
I'm sorry the circumstances.

48:35.800 --> 48:37.140
- Think nothing of it, Major.

48:37.140 --> 48:41.320
These are revealing times,
if not conflicted ones.

48:41.320 --> 48:44.600
- May I ask which base you
might be visiting next?

48:44.600 --> 48:45.770
- You may ask.

48:45.770 --> 48:47.100
- Major, may I ask where you're headed?

48:47.100 --> 48:48.630
I could use a ride to the field.

48:48.630 --> 48:50.657
- Mr. Griffin was your ride, I gather.

48:50.657 --> 48:51.960
- Yes, I could hire a car, but-

48:51.960 --> 48:54.320
- No, no, that'd be fine.

48:54.320 --> 48:56.890
I'm not due back at Chievres
until later this afternoon.

48:56.890 --> 48:58.550
I'd be happy to do it.

48:58.550 --> 49:02.943
- Thank you. Madam President,
until our next meeting.

49:04.120 --> 49:05.273
- Safe travels, Cedric.

49:07.570 --> 49:08.610
- Madam President.

49:08.610 --> 49:09.443
- Elisabeth.

49:13.680 --> 49:14.513
- Ma'am.

49:36.469 --> 49:39.010
- With the stroke of a pen,

49:39.010 --> 49:40.763
I just unleashed hell on Earth.

49:52.920 --> 49:54.810
- Where am I taking you?

49:54.810 --> 49:58.060
- It's a private field about
10 kilometers from the city.

49:58.060 --> 49:59.416
I'll direct you.

49:59.416 --> 50:02.666
- If you have the address I can GPS it.

50:06.470 --> 50:07.603
- Why did you sign it?

50:10.900 --> 50:13.050
- We needed to know
who we're dealing with.

50:14.520 --> 50:16.820
Since the knowledge of an
alien presence on Earth

50:16.820 --> 50:19.020
was conveyed to me by my predecessor,

50:19.020 --> 50:21.400
on the day after I assumed office,

50:21.400 --> 50:24.100
my fear has always been
that at some point,

50:24.100 --> 50:26.440
the military would rest
control of our armed forces

50:26.440 --> 50:27.540
from civilian command.

50:28.900 --> 50:30.500
It's easier to monitor
him if I agree with him.

50:30.500 --> 50:35.500
If I fight him, he'll burrow
into a hole so deep and black,

50:36.770 --> 50:39.070
not even Kepler could
find him .

50:45.300 --> 50:47.913
Issue the code, Argonaut Two.

50:49.800 --> 50:52.223
Argonaut, he's not here.

50:53.320 --> 50:56.563
- Yes, he is. Contact his embassy.

50:58.870 --> 51:01.320
- Yes. Yes, Madam President.

51:01.320 --> 51:04.403
- Elisabeth, everyone's been identified,

51:05.530 --> 51:07.140
take every precaution.

55:22.370 --> 55:23.430
- Senator Hadrian

55:24.420 --> 55:27.230
- I'm sure you've had enough
formalities for one day.

55:27.230 --> 55:28.157
Paul will do.

55:28.157 --> 55:30.070
- And so will this.

55:30.070 --> 55:31.510
- Excellent.

55:31.510 --> 55:33.230
- Anything on Yonah?

55:33.230 --> 55:34.580
- No, nothing.

55:34.580 --> 55:37.200
There are no records on a
Cedric Yonah in any civilian

55:37.200 --> 55:39.560
or military database.

55:39.560 --> 55:42.220
- What? He's a science attache for Colton.

55:42.220 --> 55:43.980
- Hmm. No, he isn't.

55:43.980 --> 55:45.080
Our intel can't decide

55:45.080 --> 55:46.920
if he was invited by Seward or Griffin.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.830
- And what about him? Griffin?

55:48.830 --> 55:52.390
He checks out so far,
but if he was in Germany,

55:52.390 --> 55:53.890
he didn't go through Brussels.

55:54.820 --> 55:55.990
- How did he leave?

55:55.990 --> 55:59.730
- Helicopter, no flight plan
and even more disturbing,

55:59.730 --> 56:01.900
we've lost him on the radar.

56:01.900 --> 56:04.720
- That's not possible in this airspace.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.963
- Someone made it possible just like this.

56:09.030 --> 56:10.233
- What the hell?

56:12.030 --> 56:13.953
- They're all like this from the meeting.

56:15.130 --> 56:18.480
But if you take a look at
your drive, they're all fine.

56:18.480 --> 56:19.900
That camera we hid in your fruit salad

56:19.900 --> 56:21.750
seemed to work wonderfully.

56:21.750 --> 56:24.250
And we picked up your
signal as you came topside.

56:25.500 --> 56:27.270
It's not mechanical.

56:27.270 --> 56:28.270
- No. And I'm afraid

56:28.270 --> 56:30.800
Sampson is gonna have the same results.

56:30.800 --> 56:32.140
By the way, we haven't heard from her

56:32.140 --> 56:34.490
since she went down
underneath for the meeting.

56:35.550 --> 56:37.000
Has she reported back to you?

56:38.140 --> 56:39.890
- That's disturbing.

56:39.890 --> 56:43.220
I disabled the Faraday
shield after I left.

56:43.220 --> 56:45.780
Click back to the meeting.

56:45.780 --> 56:48.440
No, something's not right.

56:48.440 --> 56:51.033
No background, no picture.

56:53.905 --> 56:55.260
You don't think you could
be one of the people?

56:55.260 --> 56:56.253
- Who knows?

56:59.450 --> 57:01.500
- Well, whoever he is, he knows who I am.

57:03.184 --> 57:05.178
- But we know who he works with.

57:05.178 --> 57:07.528
And this meeting was
always about intelligence.

58:00.300 --> 58:01.133
- Yes.

58:08.400 --> 58:10.840
- Madam President, the Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom

58:10.840 --> 58:12.877
and the President of
the Russian Federation.

58:13.710 --> 58:15.480
- Alison, thank you so much.

58:15.480 --> 58:17.810
- Well, I was just upstairs, but...

58:17.810 --> 58:20.053
- Sergei, I appreciate this.

58:20.053 --> 58:21.453
You know I wouldn't have called
Argonaut Two if it wasn't-

58:21.453 --> 58:22.513
- Elisabeth briefed us.

58:22.513 --> 58:23.500
- Stephen, where is Elisabeth?

58:23.500 --> 58:26.480
- She's in communication
with the Synedrion Council.

58:26.480 --> 58:28.722
- Let us know when she returns. Thank you.

58:28.722 --> 58:30.222
- Madam President.

58:33.750 --> 58:35.693
- Allison, there's coffee, tea.

58:51.179 --> 58:53.292
- You didn't push the panic
button because of a satellite

58:53.292 --> 58:54.811
we already knew about.

58:54.811 --> 58:55.997
Your military is out of control.

58:55.997 --> 58:59.520
- And yours isn't? You
invaded and annexed Crimea.

58:59.520 --> 59:01.180
- Crimea's parliament
voted for independence.

59:01.180 --> 59:04.030
- Oh, please. After you installed
a pro Russian government.

59:04.030 --> 59:05.561
- Your sanctions against us will not be-

59:05.561 --> 59:08.833
- Sergei. Helen. We're not here

59:08.833 --> 59:10.383
to talk about matters of state.

59:16.960 --> 59:18.100
- You're right?

59:18.100 --> 59:21.103
Of course. My apologies.

59:26.760 --> 59:29.053
- Well, now that we have detente.

59:43.300 --> 59:46.930
Helen, Argonaut Two is only called

59:46.930 --> 59:49.940
when one of the space is
an imminent outside threat,

59:49.940 --> 59:53.124
but this isn't outside it's inside.

59:59.400 --> 1:00:01.590
- I had no idea you were
such a historian on space,

1:00:01.590 --> 1:00:02.460
Elisabeth.

1:00:02.460 --> 1:00:04.863
- That's why I'm here. I briefed her.

1:00:08.370 --> 1:00:10.670
- Well, one thing was quite clear,

1:00:10.670 --> 1:00:13.943
Seward and Yonah are not
casual acquaintances.

1:00:15.030 --> 1:00:18.083
I wonder, have we been played?

1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:20.930
- In what sense?

1:00:20.930 --> 1:00:23.320
- There are only two possibilities.

1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:25.693
Either they made a mistake, which I doubt.

1:00:26.807 --> 1:00:28.240
Or they deliberately sent a signal

1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:30.233
through Milstar to smoke us out.

1:00:31.530 --> 1:00:33.710
I don't think it was the former.

1:00:33.710 --> 1:00:35.720
- Why would they possibly do that?

1:00:35.720 --> 1:00:40.720
- Answers. The crash in
47. The conference in 72.

1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:43.400
He mentioned reverse engineering

1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:46.050
and seemed to go off a
cliff when I told him

1:00:46.050 --> 1:00:47.150
we decoded the signal.

1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:50.200
We've been waiting for a move.

1:00:50.200 --> 1:00:51.620
This could have been it.

1:00:51.620 --> 1:00:53.373
- No, I don't see it.

1:00:54.290 --> 1:00:57.020
Would you have given the
Taliban classified intel

1:00:57.020 --> 1:00:59.710
to disclosed their exact locations?

1:00:59.710 --> 1:01:02.193
No. Misinformation, of course.

1:01:03.353 --> 1:01:05.520
And you remember the day
the signal was cracked

1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:08.830
and you took the information,
clarified it with our records.

1:01:08.830 --> 1:01:10.143
You nearly had a stroke.

1:01:11.290 --> 1:01:14.250
And the method we use
to crack that signal,

1:01:14.250 --> 1:01:16.450
the Geneva Convention
doesn't apply to them.

1:01:19.214 --> 1:01:20.047
- Them!

1:01:23.860 --> 1:01:25.260
- Does he know about Apollo?

1:01:29.787 --> 1:01:32.620
- This invasion by
the Russians, not good.

1:01:32.620 --> 1:01:34.570
Hard to believe they were once an ally.

1:01:37.210 --> 1:01:39.993
- Helen, this is bigger than Apollo.

1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:43.033
It transcends all of us.

1:01:47.130 --> 1:01:48.813
- Jesus Christ.

1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:51.570
- And he's not working alone.

1:01:53.410 --> 1:01:55.410
- What was her reaction?

1:01:55.410 --> 1:01:56.243
- Dejected.

1:01:58.690 --> 1:01:59.540
- And insurgency?

1:02:00.630 --> 1:02:02.640
- I suspect in all our militaries.

1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:04.860
that's why I called Argonaut Two.

1:02:04.860 --> 1:02:06.930
Like the first during the war

1:02:06.930 --> 1:02:09.223
the only way to win this
one is if we cooperate.

1:02:12.510 --> 1:02:15.060
- Reager gives a whole new
meaning to fifth column.

1:02:16.620 --> 1:02:18.050
- What about Hadrian?

1:02:18.050 --> 1:02:21.103
Is he part of this insurgency
or just an unwilling pawn?

1:02:22.818 --> 1:02:24.000
- It's hard to say at this point.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.990
His committee has oversight
over the military.

1:02:25.990 --> 1:02:29.420
So it makes sense that he's
in communication with him.

1:02:29.420 --> 1:02:31.280
And there's also a
rumor that he's going to

1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:34.370
be Anderson's VP pick in the
next presidential election.

1:02:34.370 --> 1:02:35.953
- Then we should keep him close.

1:02:37.620 --> 1:02:40.420
- Telling Colton about Apollo
was the right thing to do.

1:02:41.530 --> 1:02:43.217
She can't do anything about this publicly,

1:02:43.217 --> 1:02:44.703
but we can privately.

1:02:45.970 --> 1:02:47.370
This is about parity.

1:02:47.370 --> 1:02:49.980
The playing field needs to be leveled.

1:02:49.980 --> 1:02:51.570
There's a whole fleet of them.

1:02:51.570 --> 1:02:53.653
Look on the S.A. My gosh.

1:02:56.400 --> 1:02:57.792
They're all going against the wind.

1:02:57.792 --> 1:02:59.953
The wind is 120 knots to the west.

1:02:59.953 --> 1:03:02.073
- That was as close as we ever got.

1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:06.790
- Nothing the air force has
can compete with any of these.

1:03:06.790 --> 1:03:08.590
We need to get at least one of them.

1:03:09.630 --> 1:03:12.270
What's the update with our prototype?

1:03:12.270 --> 1:03:14.193
- In about 36 to 48 months.

1:03:16.500 --> 1:03:18.160
What if she shows up?

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:21.580
We can't deny the
Commander-in-Chief access.

1:03:21.580 --> 1:03:23.740
If she learns what we've diverted funding

1:03:23.740 --> 1:03:25.800
from NASA's Orion program for.

1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:27.940
- That's why you went in with Troy

1:03:27.940 --> 1:03:29.493
to make this diversion legal.

1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:32.720
Besides, too many of Sampson's group

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:34.640
already know about the signal,

1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:36.090
We had to tell the president.

1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:40.970
- The meeting with Reager was never about

1:03:40.970 --> 1:03:42.440
discovering the satellite,

1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:44.320
but who would surface
from within the military.

1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:46.010
That was their plan.

1:03:46.010 --> 1:03:48.823
Since 72, they've been
desperate for intelligence.

1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:50.950
Can't say I blame them.

1:03:51.940 --> 1:03:55.090
But today both sides lost
because all of the key players

1:03:55.090 --> 1:03:56.693
have been revealed to each other.

1:03:57.540 --> 1:03:59.113
If anyone was a pawn, it was me.

1:04:01.342 --> 1:04:02.992
- And Cedric came to the meeting?

1:04:04.170 --> 1:04:06.683
He hasn't been seen in
public since the war.

1:04:08.223 --> 1:04:09.190
- He insisted.

1:04:09.190 --> 1:04:10.320
we tried to reason with him,

1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:13.100
but there was no changing his mind.

1:04:13.100 --> 1:04:16.439
Reager only heard and
saw what he wanted too.

1:04:16.439 --> 1:04:17.540
- There's no choice then.

1:04:17.540 --> 1:04:19.418
We need to give the peace.

1:04:19.418 --> 1:04:22.028
At any cost because the next war

1:04:22.028 --> 1:04:23.628
could throw us to the dark ages.

1:04:25.260 --> 1:04:28.093
- Then we need a grand
alliance and a united front.

1:04:33.790 --> 1:04:36.750
- If Colton shows up, she'll
need to make a choice,

1:04:36.750 --> 1:04:38.170
either this world or theirs

1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:42.360
because until we know the extent
this alien force has on us,

1:04:42.360 --> 1:04:44.060
there's only one thing left to do.

1:05:15.670 --> 1:05:16.880
- Put me through to Space Command

1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:18.343
at Peterson Air Force Base.

1:05:24.170 --> 1:05:25.890
This is General Reager,

1:05:25.890 --> 1:05:28.823
by authorization of the
President of the United States,

1:05:29.710 --> 1:05:31.190
initiate Operation Troy.

1:06:05.360 --> 1:06:07.300
- Reager's got everyone on the offensive.

1:06:07.300 --> 1:06:10.210
So we need to keep all
eyes looking down at Earth

1:06:10.210 --> 1:06:11.110
rather than above.

1:06:12.011 --> 1:06:12.844
- Conflicts.

1:06:14.830 --> 1:06:18.610
- Yes and regional wars
that we can contain

1:06:18.610 --> 1:06:20.770
through back channels like this one.

1:06:20.770 --> 1:06:22.860
And then while that
front is moving forward,

1:06:22.860 --> 1:06:25.830
we can start gathering
intelligence on Reager's operation.

1:06:25.830 --> 1:06:27.580
- Follow the money.

1:06:27.580 --> 1:06:28.413
- Exactly.

1:06:29.620 --> 1:06:31.910
The Pentagon's Advanced
Aviation Threat Identification

1:06:31.910 --> 1:06:33.800
Program ran out of money in 2012.

1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:36.043
So he can't hide behind that.

1:06:36.950 --> 1:06:38.810
And he's probably already
tapped what he feels,

1:06:38.810 --> 1:06:40.890
the CBO and treasury won't discover

1:06:40.890 --> 1:06:42.240
along with black ops money.

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:46.940
But now he needs money for
something else, something big.

1:06:46.940 --> 1:06:48.270
I can feel it.

1:06:48.270 --> 1:06:49.390
And it's not the sat networks,

1:06:49.390 --> 1:06:51.540
they're already up and running.

1:06:51.540 --> 1:06:54.990
- Well, while the money is being traced

1:06:54.990 --> 1:06:58.500
there's plenty of hotspots
to ignite regional conflicts.

1:06:58.500 --> 1:06:59.540
We have to decide-

1:06:59.540 --> 1:07:03.393
let's
hit pause for a moment.

1:07:07.950 --> 1:07:10.057
Before we start playing God,

1:07:11.390 --> 1:07:13.270
don't you think the time has come

1:07:13.270 --> 1:07:15.163
that they reveal themselves?

1:07:16.340 --> 1:07:18.243
- They tried that, Alison in 72.

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:21.720
I agree with Reager on one point,

1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:24.010
we all know that despite
the yearning of the masses,

1:07:24.010 --> 1:07:26.720
wanting to know that they're
not alone in this universe,

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:28.263
they actually prefer it that way.

1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:30.830
Look, I don't like this
job any more than you do,

1:07:30.830 --> 1:07:32.240
but no prime minister or president

1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:33.480
should be saddled with this knowledge.

1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:34.993
Nevermind, responsibility.

1:07:35.920 --> 1:07:38.593
That is the hand we've
been dealt, and thank God.

1:07:39.670 --> 1:07:43.220
So we're here playing cards
in this cosmic game of poker,

1:07:43.220 --> 1:07:44.270
I'll aim for a Royal.

1:07:46.740 --> 1:07:48.923
- And let's be clear Allison.

1:07:48.923 --> 1:07:50.780
This is not about playing God,

1:07:50.780 --> 1:07:53.506
it is about delaying revelation.

1:07:53.506 --> 1:07:55.090
Reager thinks he knows his enemy,

1:07:55.090 --> 1:07:57.950
but his enemy is not who he thinks it is.

1:07:57.950 --> 1:07:59.313
He's acting conventionally.

1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:02.700
And if it's true that like-minded people,

1:08:02.700 --> 1:08:06.165
in our respective military
and intelligence operations

1:08:06.165 --> 1:08:08.330
have been compromised
and are following him,

1:08:08.330 --> 1:08:10.660
then the only thing left for us to do

1:08:10.660 --> 1:08:13.413
is to make their job on Earth
as difficult as possible.

1:08:15.110 --> 1:08:19.450
We of all nations should know
that peace is not bloodness.

1:08:19.450 --> 1:08:22.573
The last thing any of us
need is a united insurgency.

1:08:25.001 --> 1:08:27.383
To quote one of your predecessors,

1:08:27.383 --> 1:08:30.020
"There is no time for ease and comfort.

1:08:30.020 --> 1:08:32.327
It is time to dare and endure."

1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:35.880
- Sergei, I think we can all agree

1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:40.020
that nothing about this
is easy or comforting,

1:08:40.020 --> 1:08:43.150
but when the day comes that we
no longer question ourselves,

1:08:43.150 --> 1:08:47.234
we become the very people
we're trying to defeat.

1:08:47.234 --> 1:08:50.098
Let us hope we endure this.

1:09:13.956 --> 1:09:15.805
- I understand.

1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:21.573
Sampson left with Cedric 15 minutes ago,

1:09:23.670 --> 1:09:26.950
and there's a radar and
communications blackout

1:09:26.950 --> 1:09:30.293
that radiates out 15
kilometers from the city.

1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:36.153
- Griffin disappears, Cedric
can't be identified, no comms.

1:09:37.625 --> 1:09:39.958
This can't be a coincidence.

1:09:45.780 --> 1:09:47.530
Put me through to Commander Halsey.

1:09:59.430 --> 1:10:02.150
- You should continue
pushing into Donbass.

1:10:02.150 --> 1:10:04.760
- What about the Security
Council and NATO?

1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:07.510
- Three of the five permanent
members are in this room.

1:10:09.250 --> 1:10:14.173
Ukraine is not part of NATO
so article five doesn't apply.

1:10:16.900 --> 1:10:18.223
Germany will complain,

1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:22.680
but their economy relies
on your good graces

1:10:22.680 --> 1:10:23.853
so it will go nowhere.

1:10:25.510 --> 1:10:28.510
Maybe superficial sanctions,
but that's as far as it will go

1:10:31.330 --> 1:10:32.890
- Coalition airstrikes against ISIL

1:10:32.890 --> 1:10:34.290
will be starting next month.

1:10:35.700 --> 1:10:39.690
With our intelligence, we
can assist ISIL's reach

1:10:39.690 --> 1:10:41.040
outside of their caliphate.

1:10:42.715 --> 1:10:47.620
- Dear God, Helen. Do you
know what you're saying?

1:10:47.620 --> 1:10:48.520
If this gets out-

1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:51.190
- Allison, if you have a
pious solution for this,

1:10:51.190 --> 1:10:52.093
we're all ears.

1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:55.550
Arresting Reager and
Hadrian is not an option.

1:10:55.550 --> 1:10:57.723
First, there's no legal basis for it.

1:10:57.723 --> 1:10:59.330
I mean, dismissing Reager
would be one thing,

1:10:59.330 --> 1:11:01.593
but removing a sitting Senator?

1:11:03.200 --> 1:11:04.890
And let's be clear,

1:11:04.890 --> 1:11:06.940
if cornered their option
could lead to a conflict

1:11:06.940 --> 1:11:07.940
of biblical proportions.

1:11:07.940 --> 1:11:08.773
You know that.

1:11:10.580 --> 1:11:12.670
Just like everyone else in this game,

1:11:12.670 --> 1:11:14.093
we need intelligence.

1:11:14.963 --> 1:11:17.430
Not just for them, but for ourselves.

1:11:17.430 --> 1:11:18.923
Because when this dam breaks,

1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:21.800
we better know who's on our ark.

1:11:24.780 --> 1:11:25.613
Debate's over

1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:38.880
- Well, as for debate, you
knew there's growing voice

1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:41.333
in the UK to leave the European Union.

1:11:43.260 --> 1:11:47.290
If the vote is to leave, it
will send the markets in turmoil

1:11:47.290 --> 1:11:50.053
and destabilize the European economy.

1:11:52.980 --> 1:11:56.480
But we can't force people to
vote one way or the other.

1:11:56.480 --> 1:11:57.980
- Elections can be influenced.

1:11:58.850 --> 1:12:00.010
Depending on the outcome,

1:12:00.010 --> 1:12:02.720
we could keep intelligence agencies

1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:04.473
and governments busy for years.

1:12:05.710 --> 1:12:07.390
The question you need to ask yourself

1:12:07.390 --> 1:12:09.750
is who do you want to
occupy the oval office

1:12:09.750 --> 1:12:10.857
after you leave.

1:12:11.911 --> 1:12:13.650
Who do you think is best equipped

1:12:13.650 --> 1:12:15.563
to handle matters of space?

1:12:17.250 --> 1:12:19.600
This is where we keep our friends close,

1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:21.092
but our enemies closer.

1:12:55.570 --> 1:12:58.290
- Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

1:12:58.290 --> 1:13:02.760
The council has known for some
time that there is one hangar

1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:04.410
that central can not see through.

1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:07.780
As General Reager has been identified

1:13:07.780 --> 1:13:11.070
as part of this military insurgency

1:13:11.070 --> 1:13:15.660
and with his frequent trips to
the base, the time has come,

1:13:15.660 --> 1:13:18.713
where we need to know
what's inside that hanger.

1:13:19.830 --> 1:13:20.683
A bit of history.

1:13:21.690 --> 1:13:23.380
During the Cold War, Wright was home

1:13:23.380 --> 1:13:25.100
to the Aeronautical System Center

1:13:25.100 --> 1:13:28.240
and the National Air and
Space Intelligence Center.

1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:31.770
If there was a new aerospace
weapon or intelligence system

1:13:31.770 --> 1:13:34.270
it was conceived, designed, tested,

1:13:34.270 --> 1:13:36.163
and deployed from Wright,

1:13:37.170 --> 1:13:40.883
but it was World War II
that brought it home to us.

1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:46.100
just after the war, Operation
Paperclip landed 200 plus

1:13:46.100 --> 1:13:49.800
Nazi German scientists
and technicians at Wright.

1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:52.460
The most famous of them
was Wernher von Braun,

1:13:52.460 --> 1:13:56.420
whose Saturn V rockets,
landed men on the moon in 1969

1:13:57.440 --> 1:14:00.410
and resulted in the greatest cover-up

1:14:00.410 --> 1:14:01.883
in Earth's known history.

1:14:06.420 --> 1:14:10.180
- Does the council have any
idea what's in that hangar?

1:14:10.180 --> 1:14:13.023
- None. And security is biometric.

1:14:14.290 --> 1:14:15.930
- Well, the answer is simple,

1:14:15.930 --> 1:14:18.120
Wright is your the next base inspection.

1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:21.483
- As Commander-in-Chief, you're
the only one that can go.

1:14:23.050 --> 1:14:26.503
- Well, there may be
another, but time is short.

1:14:31.730 --> 1:14:36.283
If I do this, we lay every,
every card on the table.

1:14:38.300 --> 1:14:39.430
I think we should wait.

1:14:39.430 --> 1:14:41.030
- What for?

1:14:41.030 --> 1:14:43.700
You need to take the same lead with Reager

1:14:43.700 --> 1:14:44.900
as you just did with us.

1:15:36.290 --> 1:15:37.890
- Glad you knew how to get here.

1:15:39.140 --> 1:15:41.123
It's weird that GPS didn't work.

1:15:48.520 --> 1:15:52.470
That was a long call you had,
I hate teleconference calls,

1:15:52.470 --> 1:15:54.040
especially when you just have to listen

1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:55.733
while someone else drones on.

1:15:58.080 --> 1:15:59.120
- Just because I was listening

1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:01.303
doesn't mean I wasn't saying anything.

1:16:08.194 --> 1:16:10.440
It looks like
your ride's not here yet.

1:16:10.440 --> 1:16:11.640
Do you need to call someone?

1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:12.473
Nope.

1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:18.500
So tell me Ellen, you've
been in the military what?

1:16:18.500 --> 1:16:20.030
Since high school?

1:16:20.030 --> 1:16:21.500
- Just about.

1:16:21.500 --> 1:16:24.000
- What brought you to the
air force, specifically?

1:16:25.650 --> 1:16:27.450
- Well, ever since I was a kid,

1:16:27.450 --> 1:16:29.500
I wanted to know how to fly.

1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:31.270
At first, it was just
the remote control planes

1:16:31.270 --> 1:16:32.876
and then before I knew it,

1:16:32.876 --> 1:16:35.200
I was learning to fly a
Cessna while in high school.

1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:36.907
My father showed me.

1:16:36.907 --> 1:16:38.910
- He was a pilot? Your
parents must be proud.

1:16:38.910 --> 1:16:41.220
- Yes. Commercial. He is.

1:16:41.220 --> 1:16:42.470
Mom?

1:16:42.470 --> 1:16:43.843
- She died when I was 10.

1:16:44.730 --> 1:16:46.040
- Sorry.

1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:48.113
- Oh, thank you. It's all right.

1:16:49.550 --> 1:16:51.463
So it was just my dad, me.

1:16:52.570 --> 1:16:53.930
I used to love when he would sneak me

1:16:53.930 --> 1:16:55.083
on to the flight deck.

1:16:56.180 --> 1:16:59.120
- Flying is rather intoxicating, isn't it?

1:16:59.120 --> 1:16:59.953
- Oh, yes.

1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:03.343
- Doing some work on the F-35?

1:17:05.100 --> 1:17:06.470
- Not as much as I would like,

1:17:06.470 --> 1:17:08.413
program is a development nightmare.

1:17:09.930 --> 1:17:10.763
- So I hear.

1:17:12.360 --> 1:17:14.860
So then you got a degree
in aerospace engineering.

1:17:15.800 --> 1:17:17.320
- Yes. How did you know?

1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:20.360
- Just an educated guess
with your satellite work.

1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:22.940
Any other reasons why
you joined the military?

1:17:22.940 --> 1:17:24.492
Forgive my asking.

1:17:24.492 --> 1:17:26.733
I always find the stories interesting.

1:17:27.610 --> 1:17:30.820
- I guess a sense of adventure,

1:17:30.820 --> 1:17:33.203
seeing new things, traveling.

1:17:34.460 --> 1:17:35.293
What about you?

1:17:35.293 --> 1:17:38.450
What made you so passionate
about science and history?

1:17:38.450 --> 1:17:41.107
That was quite the speech
you gave to General Reager.

1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:44.660
- Well, when you've been
at it as long as I've been,

1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:48.083
let's just say it's a
long experience, long.

1:17:49.510 --> 1:17:51.610
But for me it's how science
transcends the past,

1:17:51.610 --> 1:17:53.140
present and future.

1:17:53.140 --> 1:17:56.300
I've always been curious, I
guess, wanting to contribute,

1:17:56.300 --> 1:17:58.730
wanting to understand the unknown,

1:17:58.730 --> 1:18:00.723
something my parents instilled in me.

1:18:01.820 --> 1:18:04.210
They taught me to understand
that once you know the unknown,

1:18:04.210 --> 1:18:07.163
it no longer frightens you
because you can learn from it.

1:18:08.169 --> 1:18:10.907
But learning is three-dimensional
not two like Reager.

1:18:11.917 --> 1:18:13.750
- You don't like him.

1:18:13.750 --> 1:18:16.160
- It's nothing to do with
like, but it's everything to do

1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:17.580
with the fact that he came to that meeting

1:18:17.580 --> 1:18:19.603
for one reason only, to get a signature.

1:18:20.820 --> 1:18:23.010
- He's always been objective-driven.

1:18:23.010 --> 1:18:26.130
He didn't rise to the rank he
has without being decisive.

1:18:26.130 --> 1:18:28.510
- True. We all have our objectives.

1:18:28.510 --> 1:18:30.610
Speaking of, you and your group

1:18:30.610 --> 1:18:33.754
must've been pretty excited
when you made this discovery.

1:18:33.754 --> 1:18:37.457
- Oh, it was incredible

1:18:39.780 --> 1:18:41.703
to know that we're not alone,

1:18:44.710 --> 1:18:48.703
but I'll admit it, I'm scared.

1:18:51.955 --> 1:18:55.960
Maybe. Maybe I just don't
understand this unknown.

1:18:57.780 --> 1:19:00.300
- Yet. You see what was exciting to me

1:19:00.300 --> 1:19:02.720
was the fact that some
civilization found Earth

1:19:02.720 --> 1:19:04.490
worthy to look at, to study.

1:19:04.490 --> 1:19:06.240
Kepler may already be looking back,

1:19:07.270 --> 1:19:08.960
but there's a technology gap

1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:11.410
and so many don't understand
what they can't see.

1:19:12.970 --> 1:19:15.520
Someday direct imaging from
Earth will be possible.

1:19:16.393 --> 1:19:17.993
- I hope I'm around to see that.

1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:22.210
- Unlike Reager, at least you want to see.

1:19:22.210 --> 1:19:24.651
So how long have you worked with him?

1:19:24.651 --> 1:19:27.560
- Of and on about 10 years? Why?

1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:28.563
- Do you trust him?

1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:32.270
- That's quite a question
coming from a civilian.

1:19:32.270 --> 1:19:34.270
It's not a matter of trust.

1:19:34.270 --> 1:19:36.880
It's about following the chain of command

1:19:36.880 --> 1:19:39.050
- And respecting that chain?

1:19:39.050 --> 1:19:39.893
- Absolutely.

1:19:40.930 --> 1:19:42.350
- I can imagine then you're conflicted

1:19:42.350 --> 1:19:45.707
because you're still wondering
how he decoded the signal.

1:19:45.707 --> 1:19:47.860
What did Reager mean when he said,

1:19:47.860 --> 1:19:48.693
- With everything we know,

1:19:48.693 --> 1:19:51.240
we should have seen this one coming?

1:19:53.273 --> 1:19:55.680
- How the hell did you hear that?

1:19:55.680 --> 1:19:56.820
You were across the room?

1:19:56.820 --> 1:19:59.513
- It doesn't matter, what
does is what he meant.

1:20:00.600 --> 1:20:03.240
- Cedric, I've enjoyed our talk,

1:20:03.240 --> 1:20:06.550
but I am not disclosing
classified information.

1:20:06.550 --> 1:20:09.240
I think you can wait for your ride alone.

1:20:09.240 --> 1:20:11.730
- Information that in addition
to anti-gravity propulsion,

1:20:11.730 --> 1:20:13.430
the satellite had stealth technology

1:20:13.430 --> 1:20:16.700
and in fact, disappeared
right in front of the X-37.

1:20:16.700 --> 1:20:18.420
You remember what I told him?

1:20:19.600 --> 1:20:21.650
How long the satellite has been in orbit?

1:20:22.659 --> 1:20:24.860
It could be one year, it could be 100.

1:20:24.860 --> 1:20:26.010
It could be a thousand.

1:20:28.080 --> 1:20:29.480
- Neither one of you have any idea,

1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:32.480
and it's been the subject
of numerous conversations.

1:20:32.480 --> 1:20:34.863
There is something we both
know that Reager doesn't.

1:20:35.720 --> 1:20:37.380
You're sure it wasn't Earth-based signal

1:20:37.380 --> 1:20:39.680
that reflected off some
piece of space debris?

1:20:43.325 --> 1:20:46.694
When I asked you that you turned
ashen white, just like now.

1:20:46.694 --> 1:20:49.110
It was that moment when
you and I made a connection.

1:20:49.110 --> 1:20:50.700
Simply you lied to Reager either

1:20:50.700 --> 1:20:52.500
because you didn't
understand what you detected

1:20:52.500 --> 1:20:54.100
or didn't want to understand it.

1:20:55.352 --> 1:20:56.840
If the signal originated
on earth from say,

1:20:56.840 --> 1:20:59.920
a radio telescope, that would
have been a different story.

1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:02.490
The transmission originated
in the atmosphere

1:21:02.490 --> 1:21:05.260
to the satellite at LG2 through Milstar,

1:21:05.260 --> 1:21:07.090
and back to its origin.

1:21:07.090 --> 1:21:08.440
- How do you know all this?

1:21:09.610 --> 1:21:10.740
- Because I sent it

1:21:13.721 --> 1:21:15.820
You know, as well as I
that signals intelligence

1:21:15.820 --> 1:21:17.630
didn't decrypt the transmission.

1:21:17.630 --> 1:21:19.270
Your civilian self probably wanted to know

1:21:19.270 --> 1:21:21.190
how decryption was possible,

1:21:21.190 --> 1:21:24.440
but your military training told
you to just follow command,

1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:26.930
but something, something told you

1:21:26.930 --> 1:21:29.203
to report the origin of
the signal differently.

1:21:30.878 --> 1:21:35.140
"With everything we
know," what did he mean?

1:21:35.140 --> 1:21:37.677
- I could go to jail for this.

1:21:37.677 --> 1:21:39.870
- You're already in a jail of conflict,

1:21:39.870 --> 1:21:41.420
an untenable command structure.

1:21:44.090 --> 1:21:47.120
- It's not that I didn't
want to understand.

1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:48.513
I didn't want him to.

1:21:49.580 --> 1:21:52.703
He's beyond obsessed with
anti-gravity propulsion.

1:21:53.910 --> 1:21:56.150
He brought me and some
others in several years ago

1:21:56.150 --> 1:21:58.280
to go through everything
we had on the subject,

1:21:58.280 --> 1:22:01.650
from Project Sign, Grudge and Blue Book

1:22:01.650 --> 1:22:04.470
to black opps aerospace programs.

1:22:04.470 --> 1:22:06.850
He even once showed us a video

1:22:06.850 --> 1:22:11.510
of something flying at a
headwind of over 120 knots.

1:22:11.510 --> 1:22:14.003
I say something because
it's still unidentified.

1:22:15.530 --> 1:22:17.080
All of us were caught up in it.

1:22:18.910 --> 1:22:20.590
- How far did you get?

1:22:20.590 --> 1:22:24.700
- Theoretically, we made
some solid progress.

1:22:24.700 --> 1:22:26.440
When he had his transfer everything we had

1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:27.990
to a working group at Wright-Patterson,

1:22:27.990 --> 1:22:30.890
we were led to believe it was
to benefit the F-35 program.

1:22:32.050 --> 1:22:34.620
We heard nothing for months,

1:22:34.620 --> 1:22:38.180
then this signal brought us
all back to General Reager.

1:22:38.180 --> 1:22:39.710
- Compartmentalize.

1:22:39.710 --> 1:22:41.740
One group does one thing,
another does something else,

1:22:41.740 --> 1:22:43.520
but only a handful, know everything.

1:22:43.520 --> 1:22:45.043
Classic military structure.

1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:48.340
- I've been honest with you Cedric.

1:22:48.340 --> 1:22:50.970
Now you need to be honest with me.

1:22:50.970 --> 1:22:53.393
How did you send this signal?

1:22:54.800 --> 1:22:56.610
- How is a matter of science.

1:22:56.610 --> 1:22:58.140
But make no mistake,

1:22:58.140 --> 1:23:01.430
there's no coincidence that
your group received a signal.

1:23:01.430 --> 1:23:02.360
We knew you were monitoring

1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:04.657
that particular Milstar satellite.

1:23:07.470 --> 1:23:08.363
- Oh my God.

1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:13.450
You worked for General Reager, don't you?

1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:17.033
This was all about
intelligence, wasn't it?

1:23:17.930 --> 1:23:20.220
We've been hearing about security sweeps,

1:23:20.220 --> 1:23:24.360
surprise base inspections,
national security.

1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:29.153
Oh my God. What have I gotten into?

1:23:30.410 --> 1:23:34.030
- Ellen, I don't work for Reager,

1:23:34.030 --> 1:23:35.710
but yes, this is about intelligence.

1:23:35.710 --> 1:23:36.653
We need your help.

1:23:37.500 --> 1:23:38.333
- My help?

1:23:39.210 --> 1:23:40.723
Wait, we?

1:23:42.201 --> 1:23:45.833
- In your line of work, do
the years, 1947 in 1972,

1:23:45.833 --> 1:23:47.267
have any meaning to you?

1:23:53.180 --> 1:23:57.360
- '47 was operation Blue Nose.

1:23:57.360 --> 1:23:59.960
And while that ridiculous Roswell story

1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:04.360
and '72 was when the Apollo program ended.

1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:06.410
- Do you know why it ended?

1:24:06.410 --> 1:24:09.632
- Everyone knows that, to
develop the space shuttle.

1:24:15.330 --> 1:24:16.370
What the...

1:24:21.190 --> 1:24:23.083
There's someone at the end of the field.

1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:25.961
- I know.

1:24:28.130 --> 1:24:30.630
My involvement in all this
started before the war.

1:24:31.650 --> 1:24:32.483
- Iraq?

1:24:33.650 --> 1:24:34.483
- World War II.

1:24:38.020 --> 1:24:40.420
There was a justifiable concern
that after two millennia,

1:24:40.420 --> 1:24:43.260
your technology wasn't progressing fast enough.

1:24:43.260 --> 1:24:45.120
If something happened to
ours, for whatever reason,

1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:46.830
there was no backstop.

1:24:46.830 --> 1:24:49.630
How did Sagan say it,
"In all this vastness,

1:24:49.630 --> 1:24:51.590
there was no hint that help
will come from elsewhere

1:24:51.590 --> 1:24:53.067
to save us from ourselves."

1:24:54.950 --> 1:24:58.980
So a decision was made to advance
certain fields of science.

1:24:58.980 --> 1:25:01.090
I was sent to the Peenemunde
Army Research Center

1:25:01.090 --> 1:25:02.607
in Germany.

1:25:02.607 --> 1:25:05.350
It was truly the Cape Kennedy of its day.

1:25:05.350 --> 1:25:07.800
Under the guise of a visiting scientist,

1:25:07.800 --> 1:25:09.400
I offered assistance here and there,

1:25:09.400 --> 1:25:11.983
particularly in areas of
propulsion and guidance.

1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:14.370
Well, I got caught up in my work

1:25:14.370 --> 1:25:16.370
and showed them things I shouldn't have.

1:25:17.242 --> 1:25:19.180
When I refused to cooperate further.

1:25:19.180 --> 1:25:21.663
I was arrested and sent
to a concentration camp.

1:25:24.050 --> 1:25:25.250
You can imagine my disgust

1:25:25.250 --> 1:25:28.090
when Reager was talking
about identification,

1:25:28.090 --> 1:25:29.940
not from my people, but the millions.

1:25:31.130 --> 1:25:32.830
The millions that never went home.

1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:37.990
Well, after the camp was liberated,

1:25:37.990 --> 1:25:41.683
I found myself alone in the
field, just waiting to go home.

1:25:43.070 --> 1:25:45.960
The German scientists were
repatriated to the United States

1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:48.853
and continued their work or
should I say some of my work.

1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:51.360
There was no choice, but to monitor

1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:53.560
all military installations
for developments.

1:25:55.150 --> 1:25:58.150
A couple of years after the war
a patrol went down in Roswell,

1:25:59.850 --> 1:26:01.270
for more reasons than I can count,

1:26:01.270 --> 1:26:03.840
It was impossible to retrieve
certain remains of the crew

1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:07.800
and the aircraft's propulsion
and stealth technologies.

1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:09.900
We had high hopes during the 1960s though.

1:26:10.890 --> 1:26:12.910
Perhaps the seeds of
science planted in war

1:26:12.910 --> 1:26:14.160
would come back in peace.

1:26:15.270 --> 1:26:18.370
When first contact was
finally made in 1969,

1:26:18.370 --> 1:26:21.010
everything seemed to be
progressing the way we wanted.

1:26:21.010 --> 1:26:22.640
Oh, there were concerns
in various governments

1:26:22.640 --> 1:26:24.190
to say nothing of the military,

1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:27.950
but Synedrion Council
felt they had to proceed,

1:26:27.950 --> 1:26:31.070
that living in the shadows
was no longer an option.

1:26:31.070 --> 1:26:33.120
In 1972, they agreed to meet with your

1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:35.440
United Nations security council

1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:39.090
to pave the way for revelation
that mankind is not alone.

1:26:39.090 --> 1:26:40.440
First contact, if you will.

1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:44.280
The military escort never
brought them to that meeting.

1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:46.230
We've been looking for them ever since.

1:26:47.670 --> 1:26:49.170
You can only imagine my guilt.

1:26:50.030 --> 1:26:52.460
It didn't matter what our
involvement was in your world

1:26:52.460 --> 1:26:53.370
or our technology.

1:26:53.370 --> 1:26:54.680
We couldn't find them.

1:26:55.870 --> 1:26:58.290
It was Griffin's idea for the signal.

1:26:58.290 --> 1:27:00.033
We had to know who would surface.

1:27:00.950 --> 1:27:03.330
Signal was too tempting for Reager.

1:27:03.330 --> 1:27:05.870
He knew there was only one
group that could decrypt it.

1:27:05.870 --> 1:27:06.960
- Group?

1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:09.783
- Our parents, the ones
your military kidnapped.

1:27:11.756 --> 1:27:14.393
Oh, come on. Seriously?

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:19.230
You don't honestly expect me
to believe any of this, do you?

1:27:20.556 --> 1:27:23.272
- I only expect you to
believe what you can see?

1:27:33.610 --> 1:27:35.947
- Governor, you asked for this?

1:27:35.947 --> 1:27:36.947
- Thank you.

1:27:37.860 --> 1:27:39.410
- Good to see you again, Major.

1:27:40.625 --> 1:27:42.096
- Where there any problems?

1:27:42.096 --> 1:27:44.706
- Aside from the curator? None.

1:27:46.570 --> 1:27:49.460
- I'm not laughing. What did he call you?

1:27:49.460 --> 1:27:50.540
- Governor.

1:27:50.540 --> 1:27:51.533
- Governor of what?

1:27:52.810 --> 1:27:54.360
- You haven't told her?

1:27:54.360 --> 1:27:55.883
- Nearly everything, but.

1:27:56.910 --> 1:28:00.140
- Major, Cedric Yonah, is the
Governor of Dominion Earth

1:28:00.140 --> 1:28:02.477
and Premier of the Synedrion Council.

1:28:03.764 --> 1:28:05.910
- I thought you said it was
your parents on this council

1:28:05.910 --> 1:28:06.800
or whatever.

1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:10.510
- They were. We ascended
after they disappeared.

1:28:10.510 --> 1:28:13.140
James let's keep an open
comm for transparency.

1:28:13.140 --> 1:28:15.042
Was there anything else?

1:28:15.042 --> 1:28:16.490
- During your conference with the council,

1:28:16.490 --> 1:28:17.750
Central monitored Reager's calls

1:28:17.750 --> 1:28:20.410
from Chievres Air Base to Patterson AFB,

1:28:20.410 --> 1:28:23.550
on his order GPS and Sat comm Directorate,

1:28:23.550 --> 1:28:25.210
Echelon and the Deep Space Network

1:28:25.210 --> 1:28:27.360
received new detection programming.

1:28:27.360 --> 1:28:30.380
To avoid intercept, Central
has rerouted all comm traffic

1:28:30.380 --> 1:28:31.663
to the secondary grid.

1:28:32.762 --> 1:28:34.263
- That should buy us some time.

1:28:35.812 --> 1:28:39.110
- Reager also inquired about
your whereabouts Major Sampson.

1:28:40.580 --> 1:28:42.830
Now civilian agencies and
military installations

1:28:42.830 --> 1:28:44.460
in the region are on
high alert over a radar

1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:46.360
and communications blackout.

1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:47.800
The United States and United Kingdom's

1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:50.930
are claiming it's Russian
retaliation over the G7.

1:28:50.930 --> 1:28:53.820
The Belgian authorities claim
it's a terrorist attack.

1:28:53.820 --> 1:28:56.100
NATO has elevated its
alert readiness to Amber.

1:28:56.100 --> 1:28:59.033
And F-16s have been
scrambled from Melsbroek AB.

1:28:59.890 --> 1:29:03.300
Central will hold the
blackout until our departure.

1:29:03.300 --> 1:29:06.450
- My God. How do you know all this?

1:29:06.450 --> 1:29:09.503
- Why? X-ray communications, Major.

1:29:13.220 --> 1:29:14.683
- Keep your eye on Cedric.

1:29:18.030 --> 1:29:22.381
- That's not hard sir.
He's keeping them on me.

1:29:22.381 --> 1:29:25.631
- If an opportunity
presents itself, take it.

1:29:25.631 --> 1:29:28.214
We need to know more about him.

1:29:32.150 --> 1:29:33.280
- Thank you, James.

1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:36.663
- Of course. Major, I look
forward to our next meeting.

1:29:42.990 --> 1:29:43.823
Governor.

1:29:52.950 --> 1:29:54.350
- There's a hanger at Wright-Patterson

1:29:54.350 --> 1:29:55.860
that we can't see through.

1:29:55.860 --> 1:29:57.557
That's why we need your help.

1:29:58.523 --> 1:30:00.530
- What about your X-ray communications?

1:30:00.530 --> 1:30:05.410
- Don't mock me. I'm in no mood for it.

1:30:05.410 --> 1:30:07.850
It's sheathed in the
same materials we use.

1:30:07.850 --> 1:30:10.233
The crash of 47, the stealth technology,

1:30:11.218 --> 1:30:12.300
if you know how to manufacture it,

1:30:12.300 --> 1:30:14.983
it's easily adaptable to
structures and satellites.

1:30:16.050 --> 1:30:18.563
Ellen, I can't stress
this next point enough.

1:30:19.590 --> 1:30:21.910
I know you've heard some
fantastic stories today.

1:30:21.910 --> 1:30:24.760
And by the look on your face,
you don't believe any of them.

1:30:24.760 --> 1:30:27.590
But if Reager is developing
what I think he is,

1:30:27.590 --> 1:30:30.680
the balance of power could
shift in such a direction

1:30:30.680 --> 1:30:33.853
that life on this planet,
as we know it, will be over.

1:30:35.110 --> 1:30:37.500
Think, has it ever, ever occurred to you,

1:30:37.500 --> 1:30:39.970
why the United States has
built a military complex

1:30:39.970 --> 1:30:42.500
that could destroy the
world 10 times over.

1:30:42.500 --> 1:30:45.410
Please don't tell me it's
because of the Soviet Union.

1:30:45.410 --> 1:30:47.000
It's because they know they aren't alone,

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:49.653
and paranoia is driving
this uncontrollable madness.

1:30:51.370 --> 1:30:53.465
We need to know where our parents are

1:30:53.465 --> 1:30:55.247
and what's in that hanger.

1:30:55.247 --> 1:30:57.363
I confess I'm running out of patience,

1:30:58.220 --> 1:31:01.210
but the alternative to
patience is not an option.

1:31:01.210 --> 1:31:04.690
I've seen war in all its
ugliness, too many times.

1:31:04.690 --> 1:31:07.210
The lines of peace need to be drawn here,

1:31:07.210 --> 1:31:10.952
between us, on this field, in this moment.

1:31:14.550 --> 1:31:16.160
You sadly deal in absolutes

1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:18.013
because the unknown terrifies you.

1:31:19.370 --> 1:31:22.760
- General, if I sign this,

1:31:22.760 --> 1:31:24.803
what's the objective of Operation Troy?

1:31:26.110 --> 1:31:26.960
- Identification.

1:31:43.960 --> 1:31:45.820
- So help me, God,

1:31:45.820 --> 1:31:48.773
what you've said is either
all true or all a lie.

1:31:51.350 --> 1:31:56.030
All my years of training
have told me to listen,

1:31:56.030 --> 1:31:58.633
stay calm and to act decisively.

1:32:00.530 --> 1:32:03.513
But the oath I took,
isn't just a set of words.

1:32:05.110 --> 1:32:08.763
General Reager is one thing,
but the president is another.

1:32:10.140 --> 1:32:13.683
I cannot pledge my allegiance
on just your words alone.

1:32:14.676 --> 1:32:16.270
- Then you need to ask yourself,

1:32:16.270 --> 1:32:18.750
once you eliminate the
impossible whatever remains,

1:32:18.750 --> 1:32:21.100
no matter how improbable,
must be the truth.

1:32:22.785 --> 1:32:24.103
- Doveryai, no proveryai.

1:32:25.510 --> 1:32:26.913
- Trust, but verify.

1:32:28.614 --> 1:32:32.680
- This is exactly what they
want. How can you trust her?

1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:33.880
- How can I not try?

1:32:39.185 --> 1:32:42.175
Can you see the forest for the trees?

1:33:51.615 --> 1:33:52.698
- Oh, my God.

1:33:55.780 --> 1:34:00.030
You told us everything in
that meeting, everything.

1:34:03.583 --> 1:34:06.957
- You only hear what, not what you should.

1:34:17.169 --> 1:34:18.545
You only believe what you see.

1:34:33.600 --> 1:34:34.433
This is for you.

1:34:39.430 --> 1:34:41.523
NASA can verify its authenticity.

1:34:42.420 --> 1:34:44.823
If you can help us,
Griffin is your contact.

1:34:46.770 --> 1:34:47.603
- Thank you.

1:34:59.110 --> 1:35:00.787
- How old are you?

1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:09.210
- Old enough to never forget.

1:35:11.100 --> 1:35:12.700
- Why are you here?

1:35:12.700 --> 1:35:13.533
- Answers.

1:35:14.560 --> 1:35:17.523
You honestly don't believe we're
the only ones here, do you?

1:35:18.580 --> 1:35:20.153
- Where are you from?

1:35:23.399 --> 1:35:24.232
- Earth.

1:37:37.880 --> 1:37:39.130
- General Reager, please.

1:37:45.690 --> 1:37:46.730
- What is it?

1:37:46.730 --> 1:37:48.843
- Sampson signal has reappeared.

1:37:50.130 --> 1:37:50.963
- Where?

1:37:52.145 --> 1:37:56.183
- A field. 10 kilometers from the city.

1:41:48.479 --> 1:41:49.430
- Do you have any idea what he wants?

1:41:49.430 --> 1:41:52.850
- No. He just wanted, more like
demanded a meeting.

1:41:52.850 --> 1:41:55.350
- And he flew from Colorado to Brussels?

1:41:55.350 --> 1:41:56.700
- Well, it must be important.

1:41:57.900 --> 1:41:58.733
- Bill.

1:41:58.733 --> 1:41:59.617
- Yes, Madam president.

1:41:59.617 --> 1:42:01.117
- I need a moment.

1:42:05.460 --> 1:42:08.090
- If Reager learns what brought
a Holocaust to your world

1:42:08.090 --> 1:42:09.270
you're going to have to explain to this one,

1:42:09.270 --> 1:42:10.160
why your people who've been here

1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:12.360
for the last 2000 plus years.

1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:14.420
- That's why it's imperative
we find our parents.

1:42:14.420 --> 1:42:15.810
If they talked under pressure or-

1:42:15.810 --> 1:42:18.810
- Elisabeth, I understand,
but understand me,

1:42:18.810 --> 1:42:21.670
I'm only interested in
protecting this planet

1:42:21.670 --> 1:42:24.193
or as you people call it, the First World.
