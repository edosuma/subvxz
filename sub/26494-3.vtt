WEBVTT

00:00.315 --> 00:02.249
Let's move.

00:02.251 --> 00:03.517
I know this must be
so hard.

00:03.519 --> 00:04.885
Without your grace,

00:04.887 --> 00:06.453
without your powers.

00:06.455 --> 00:09.590
I can't kill demons.
I can't find Dean and Michael.

00:09.592 --> 00:11.191
I'm useless.

00:11.193 --> 00:13.394
Cops just turned up
a pile of corpses in Duluth,

00:13.396 --> 00:14.562
and their eyes
were burnt out.

00:14.564 --> 00:15.863
So Michael?

00:15.865 --> 00:17.531
It was like
he was experimenting.

00:17.533 --> 00:19.433
Experimenting?
What for?

00:19.435 --> 00:21.802
There are ways
to enhance your talents.

00:21.804 --> 00:23.270
Nothing's working!

00:23.272 --> 00:25.372
Do you propose we wage a war
on the humans?

00:25.374 --> 00:27.241
This isn't just Michael
we're talking about.

00:27.243 --> 00:28.475
It's Dean.

00:29.478 --> 00:30.611
Sammy.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.445
It's me.

00:37.086 --> 00:39.119
It's just every time
I think about it, you know,

00:39.121 --> 00:40.387
it's like a --
it's like a nightmare.

00:40.389 --> 00:42.456
I mean, I can't eat.
I can't sleep.

00:42.458 --> 00:43.991
It's always just there,
watching.

00:43.993 --> 00:45.793
Dean, it's just a beard.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.328
I've been a little busy
lately.

00:47.330 --> 00:49.229
Yeah, well,
that's not an excuse.

00:49.231 --> 00:50.898
You know, 'cause, uh,
"Duck Dynasty" called,

00:50.900 --> 00:53.934
and they just --
they want it all back.

00:53.936 --> 00:55.269
Some people say
I look good.

00:55.271 --> 00:58.672
No. No, Sam.
No people say that.

01:00.176 --> 01:01.308
Hey, hey.

01:01.310 --> 01:02.576
You, uh --

01:02.578 --> 01:04.510
Hey, if you're gonna
ask if I'm okay,

01:04.513 --> 01:06.680
you don't have to.

01:06.682 --> 01:08.649
All right.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.250
It's just, uh,
you know,

01:10.252 --> 01:13.120
you didn't talk a whole lot
on the ride here.

01:13.122 --> 01:15.255
Look, Michael bailed,
all right?

01:15.257 --> 01:16.423
I don't know how.

01:16.425 --> 01:17.524
I don't know why.

01:17.526 --> 01:19.026
He just --

01:19.028 --> 01:21.261
He just cleared out.

01:21.263 --> 01:22.963
And as far
as my memory goes,

01:22.965 --> 01:24.698
I mean, everything
from the second I said yes

01:24.700 --> 01:27.501
to the moment I walked
through those doors is blank,

01:27.503 --> 01:29.670
so I'm good.

01:29.672 --> 01:32.206
I'm just really, really happy
to be...

01:33.542 --> 01:35.643
...home.

01:41.150 --> 01:43.884
Yeah, there have been
a few changes made.

01:43.886 --> 01:46.353
So, uh...

01:51.193 --> 01:53.794
Yeah.
Not Michael anymore.

01:53.796 --> 01:55.796
Right.

01:55.798 --> 01:57.364
Chief told us.

01:57.366 --> 01:58.832
Welcome back.

02:00.536 --> 02:02.536
"Chief"?

02:02.538 --> 02:04.738
Yeah, I-I asked them not
to call me that, but --

02:04.740 --> 02:05.939
Dean?

02:09.078 --> 02:11.011
Hey, kid.

02:11.013 --> 02:14.381
Is it really you?

02:14.383 --> 02:15.249
Yeah.

02:28.564 --> 02:29.663
Dean.

02:29.665 --> 02:32.166
Cass.

02:32.168 --> 02:33.934
Sorry,
I wanted to be there,

02:33.936 --> 02:36.503
but we figured that Michael
would sense my presence, so --

02:36.505 --> 02:38.539
Sam told me.

02:38.541 --> 02:40.874
Ain't no thing.

02:40.876 --> 02:42.676
Where's Mary?

02:42.678 --> 02:44.178
She and Bobby
stayed back in Duluth

02:44.180 --> 02:48.782
to clean up the, uh --
uh, the situation.

02:50.853 --> 02:52.352
Yeah, well,
speaking of cleanup,

02:52.354 --> 02:56.256
I, uh...
I need a shower.

02:56.258 --> 02:58.192
Mm.

02:58.194 --> 03:00.027
Hey, y-y-you --

03:00.029 --> 03:01.261
Still okay.

03:01.263 --> 03:03.130
I promise.

03:09.905 --> 03:11.371
Uh, how's Nick?

03:11.373 --> 03:12.706
He's...

03:12.708 --> 03:13.807
He's gone.

03:13.809 --> 03:14.908
What?

03:14.910 --> 03:16.243
Nick just --

03:16.245 --> 03:17.778
He left a note,
said that he had

03:17.780 --> 03:19.613
some personal business
to attend to,

03:19.615 --> 03:23.584
and he hasn't -- he hasn't been
returning my calls.

03:23.586 --> 03:25.252
He was
in a dark place.

03:25.254 --> 03:27.287
Maybe he just
needed some time.

03:27.289 --> 03:28.789
All right.
Yeah. Maybe.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.824
Sam...

03:30.826 --> 03:33.026
Dean --
how is he really?

03:35.831 --> 03:37.965
I don't know.

03:46.976 --> 03:51.478
Why would Michael just...
give up his vessel like that?

03:51.480 --> 03:54.181
I don't know.

03:56.919 --> 03:58.619
And why was...

03:58.621 --> 04:02.623
Why was Michael
helping monsters?

04:02.625 --> 04:04.858
Cass...

04:04.860 --> 04:07.928
truth is...

04:07.930 --> 04:10.197
we don't know anything.

04:18.810 --> 04:22.810

04:33.289 --> 04:35.856
Well, what could hurt Michael
like that?

04:35.858 --> 04:38.725
Whatever it was
must've been strong.

04:38.727 --> 04:41.195
Right. So, Cass,
I'm gonna need you

04:41.197 --> 04:42.896
to, uh, get in my head.

04:42.898 --> 04:45.499
You know, do the whole
Vulcan-mind-meld thing.

04:45.501 --> 04:47.067
'Cause if I can't remember
what happened,

04:47.069 --> 04:48.468
I need you to drag it

04:48.470 --> 04:50.904
W-Wait a second.
You sure about this?

04:50.906 --> 04:52.039
Yeah.
I can handle it.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.676
- Dean...
- Cass, come on.

04:55.678 --> 04:56.844
Hit me.

05:12.027 --> 05:13.160
Anything?

05:32.715 --> 05:35.048
Dean, who was that?

06:02.444 --> 06:03.911
Sam, any news?

06:03.913 --> 06:07.014
Jody, hey, u-uh...
Yeah, uh, sorry.

06:07.016 --> 06:09.082
- Uh...
- Hey, Jody.

06:09.084 --> 06:11.418
<i>I'm back.</i>

06:11.420 --> 06:12.920
Hey, Dean.

06:12.922 --> 06:15.289
It is so good
to hear your voice.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.224
Yeah, you, too.

06:17.226 --> 06:19.660
Um, Jody, that's --
that's the good news.

06:19.662 --> 06:21.395
What's up?

06:21.397 --> 06:23.830
Um, you know the thing
that killed Kaia

06:23.832 --> 06:25.999
in the Bad Place?

06:26.001 --> 06:28.735
- <i>Well, we think it's here.</i>
- What?

06:28.737 --> 06:31.004
<i>Yeah, uh, any chance</i>
<i>you've noticed anything</i>

06:31.006 --> 06:32.506
rift-related over there?

06:32.508 --> 06:35.909
A flare-up or,
um, uh, anything?

06:35.911 --> 06:37.911
No, I -- No.

06:37.913 --> 06:39.913
I have video surveillance
going down at the ferry.

06:39.915 --> 06:41.648
Claire practically sits Shiva
down there.

06:41.650 --> 06:43.116
There's been nothing.

06:43.118 --> 06:44.985
<i>How do you know?</i>
Well, short version --

06:44.987 --> 06:47.187
when Michael was possessing me,
he got hurt.

06:47.189 --> 06:50.791
<i>It left a scar --</i>
<i>uh, two deep gashes.</i>

06:50.793 --> 06:52.659
Stabby, prongy,
kind of like, um --

06:52.661 --> 06:55.629
Like someone stabbed you
with a giant meat fork?

06:57.466 --> 06:59.833
Yeah. Exactly.

06:59.835 --> 07:01.034
<i>How'd you know that?</i>

07:16.018 --> 07:17.551
You're leaving?

07:18.721 --> 07:20.821
Kaia's killer
is in Sioux Falls.

07:20.823 --> 07:23.824
And he, she, or it
can hurt Michael.

07:23.826 --> 07:25.325
We just gotta
figure out how.

07:25.327 --> 07:28.562
I'll get my things.
Uh, Jack, um...

07:28.564 --> 07:30.330
that might not be
the best idea.

07:30.332 --> 07:31.832
Michael's <i>my</i> enemy, too.

07:31.834 --> 07:35.035
I fought him for months,
and Kaia --

07:35.037 --> 07:36.703
I'm the one who brought her
into this.

07:36.705 --> 07:38.872
I'm responsible
for what happened to her.

07:38.874 --> 07:40.073
I want to help.

07:40.075 --> 07:41.308
Yeah, well,
not gonna happen.

07:41.310 --> 07:42.976
Because I'm human now?

07:42.978 --> 07:44.650
Jack, maybe you just need
a little more --

07:44.674 --> 07:45.380
Training?

07:45.381 --> 07:46.713
I've been training
with Bobby.

07:46.715 --> 07:47.881
C'mon, kid.
Look at you.

07:47.883 --> 07:49.816
You're barely 100 pounds
soaking wet.

07:49.818 --> 07:51.852
You know?

07:58.327 --> 08:00.027
Wait. Jack.

08:00.029 --> 08:04.031
Hey, I didn't mean...

08:04.033 --> 08:06.333
I didn't <i>mean</i>
to be a dick.

08:12.007 --> 08:13.106
Little help here!

08:16.569 --> 08:19.736
Jules, what's going on?

08:19.738 --> 08:21.872
Case I was working
in Wichita --

08:21.874 --> 08:23.273
the missing teenagers,
dried-up husk bodies?

08:23.275 --> 08:24.408
Yeah.

08:24.410 --> 08:26.276
Turns out
it was a witch.

08:26.278 --> 08:27.711
She was holding
the girls hostage,

08:27.713 --> 08:29.413
and this...

08:29.415 --> 08:31.515
is the only
survivor.

08:31.517 --> 08:32.749
Took Broom-Hilda down
with that

08:32.751 --> 08:34.183
witch-killing bullet
you gave me,

08:34.186 --> 08:36.553
but soon as I did,
something went wrong.

08:36.554 --> 08:38.889
Didn't even have time
to bury the body before --

08:38.890 --> 08:41.758
Before what?

08:41.760 --> 08:44.428
Lora, darling,
show them.

08:52.371 --> 08:53.737
The witch
must've hexed her.

08:56.075 --> 08:58.542
Looks like an aging spell.
Can you fix it?

08:58.544 --> 09:00.777
I think so.

09:10.089 --> 09:11.955
Cass?

09:11.957 --> 09:13.590
Uh, this might
take a while.

09:13.592 --> 09:15.225
You two, go.

09:15.227 --> 09:17.127
Get to Sioux Falls before
the trail goes cold,

09:17.129 --> 09:18.629
and I'll catch up when I'm done.
- No, no, I don't know.

09:18.631 --> 09:20.330
Yeah, no, Cass is --
Cass is right.

09:20.332 --> 09:21.665
He can handle this.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.267
We need to hit the road.

09:23.269 --> 09:26.737
Let's go.

09:26.739 --> 09:27.307
Sam.

09:27.331 --> 09:29.331
All right.
All right, yep.

09:30.175 --> 09:31.875
Good work.

09:42.988 --> 09:44.421
You're in a hurry.

09:44.423 --> 09:45.756
Shouldn't I be?

09:45.758 --> 09:47.524
If you're worried
about that girl,

09:47.526 --> 09:50.961
- Cass has got it handled.
- Yeah, I know.

09:50.963 --> 09:52.863
Well, then,
what's the problem?

09:52.865 --> 09:57.801
Dean, we still have no idea
why Michael let you go

09:57.803 --> 09:59.870
or where he is now
or what he wants.

09:59.872 --> 10:01.638
Yeah, or who his favorite
Spice Girl is.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.173
Come on, man.
This isn't a joke.

10:03.175 --> 10:04.675
Something huge happened,

10:04.677 --> 10:06.843
and you won't
really even talk about it.

10:06.845 --> 10:09.946
But this whole Michael thing,
we need to deal with it.

10:09.948 --> 10:12.816
Okay, I'm literally going 80
to deal with it.

10:12.818 --> 10:14.051
How can I be running
from something

10:14.053 --> 10:16.019
when I'm racing
towards it?

10:16.021 --> 10:17.054
I don't know.

10:17.056 --> 10:18.522
- Kind of your thing.
- Okay.

10:18.524 --> 10:20.957
Okay, look,
I'm just saying...

10:20.959 --> 10:23.694
You said you let Michael in,
then, bang,

10:23.696 --> 10:24.961
you're back in a blink.

10:24.963 --> 10:29.132
But for me...
you were gone for weeks.

10:29.134 --> 10:32.035
I didn't know if you were alive.
I...

10:35.908 --> 10:38.208
I just need you
to talk to me,

10:38.210 --> 10:39.976
to slow down

10:39.978 --> 10:42.813
so I can catch up.

10:49.088 --> 10:52.556
Call Jody.
Let her know we're almost there.

11:08.073 --> 11:09.539
Dean.

11:11.276 --> 11:12.442
Oh, welcome home.

11:12.444 --> 11:13.443
Thanks.

11:13.445 --> 11:14.778
How'd you do it?

11:14.780 --> 11:16.380
What, me versus some
assbag archangel --

11:16.382 --> 11:18.882
who would you take?
- You, every time.

11:18.884 --> 11:21.218
Hi.

11:21.220 --> 11:23.520
Hey, I like it!

11:23.522 --> 11:26.256
Uh, i-it's, uh...

11:28.060 --> 11:29.626
How are you?
How are the girls?

11:29.628 --> 11:31.428
Surprisingly good.

11:31.430 --> 11:33.730
Alex is still at the hospital.
Patience is still in school.

11:33.732 --> 11:36.233
Claire's still...
Claire.

11:36.235 --> 11:38.268
I, uh...

11:38.270 --> 11:41.438
I haven't been home
since I talked to you.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.106
I may be avoiding her.

11:43.108 --> 11:44.908
It's just, before I tell her
what's going on,

11:44.910 --> 11:46.143
I need to --

11:46.145 --> 11:47.778
You need to know
what's going on.

11:47.780 --> 11:49.780
Yeah. That's it.
Yeah.

11:49.782 --> 11:52.249
Okay, so here are

11:52.251 --> 11:54.484
the locations
of the three bodies we found --

11:54.486 --> 11:55.552
headless, by the way.

11:55.554 --> 11:56.720
Human?

11:56.722 --> 11:57.888
As far as I could tell,
yep.

11:57.890 --> 11:59.222
Until I talked to you,

11:59.224 --> 12:00.457
I thought we were hunting
a human, too,

12:00.459 --> 12:01.992
maybe a serial killer.

12:01.994 --> 12:03.427
It'd be the first one
in Sioux Falls since --

12:03.429 --> 12:06.663
Well, since
Robert Leroy Anderson.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.167
Yeah. Yeah, so, um...

12:10.169 --> 12:12.002
So I figure this area
between the crime scenes,

12:12.004 --> 12:13.470
it's the best place
to start looking

12:13.472 --> 12:15.972
for whatever this is.

12:15.974 --> 12:17.974
Should we wait
till, uh, daybreak?

12:17.976 --> 12:19.609
Why?

12:19.611 --> 12:22.179
No, let's go.

12:22.181 --> 12:23.313
Yeah, uh --

12:55.147 --> 12:56.813
- I can't find it.
- Find what?

12:56.815 --> 12:58.715
The book.

12:58.717 --> 13:01.051
It's got to be around here
somewhere.

13:01.053 --> 13:03.386
She said to look
in the White Magic Lexicon.

13:03.388 --> 13:05.455
Okay, um...
I-Is it this one?

13:05.457 --> 13:08.725
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

13:19.838 --> 13:22.873
Who's that?

13:22.875 --> 13:25.242
It's a girl.
Lora.

13:25.244 --> 13:28.245
She's, um --
She's been enchanted.

13:28.247 --> 13:30.580
Like "Sleeping Beauty."

13:30.582 --> 13:34.184
No. No, not like --

13:34.186 --> 13:38.922
This aging spell, it's --
it's killing her.

13:38.924 --> 13:41.758
- Can't you just heal her?-
No. I tried.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.861
But for some reason, this magic,
it's too knotted.

13:44.863 --> 13:48.198
So we contacted Rowena.
She suggested a reversal spell,

13:48.200 --> 13:50.433
and we're reading up
on it now.

13:56.041 --> 13:59.943
Are you going
somewhere?

14:04.216 --> 14:08.518
No.

14:14.593 --> 14:16.293
We'd make better time
if we split up.

14:16.295 --> 14:18.295
Uh -- Uh, Dean,

14:18.297 --> 14:20.363
w-we'll be safer
if we stick together.

14:20.365 --> 14:22.766
Yeah, if I get a vote,
I'm Team Stick Together.

14:24.102 --> 14:25.902
Fine.

14:42.287 --> 14:44.054
Guys!

14:48.126 --> 14:49.826
Holy mother...

15:11.416 --> 15:12.282
Vampires.

15:17.856 --> 15:20.690
Jody,
these match your vics?

15:20.692 --> 15:23.426
They were John Does.
Hard to tell.

15:23.428 --> 15:25.195
Three heads,
three headless bodies --

15:25.197 --> 15:26.496
the math works.

15:26.498 --> 15:29.032
Except, Sam,
I checked those bodies.

15:29.034 --> 15:30.367
I brought
tissue samples home.

15:30.369 --> 15:32.769
Alex ran them underneath
a microscope.

15:32.771 --> 15:34.270
Silver, Dead Man's Blood --

15:34.272 --> 15:36.206
there was no reaction.

16:48.447 --> 16:50.246
What the hell?

16:50.849 --> 16:52.615
It looked just like her,
like...

16:52.617 --> 16:54.451
Kaia.

16:54.453 --> 16:56.386
You saw her die over there,
right?

16:56.388 --> 16:58.688
- Yes, absolutely.
- Then what's happening?

16:58.690 --> 17:00.590
All I know is that thing --
it dressed the same

17:00.592 --> 17:02.425
and it moved the same
as the thing that killed Kaia.

17:02.427 --> 17:03.426
Yeah.

17:03.428 --> 17:05.694
How is that
possible?

17:05.696 --> 17:07.430
I don't know.

17:07.432 --> 17:09.965
But let's find her
and ask.

17:12.386 --> 17:16.454
"Sage, pyrite,
and sheep's eye"?

17:17.083 --> 17:19.083
- We got that here?
- Yes.

17:19.309 --> 17:22.676
Storage room, red cabinet,
bottom drawer.

17:22.679 --> 17:24.646
It's marked
"gross stuff."

17:34.558 --> 17:36.558
Oh, it's okay.

17:40.530 --> 17:43.164
Is that your dad?

17:43.166 --> 17:45.634
One of them, yes.

17:48.038 --> 17:51.740
Do you have parents
or someone we can call?

17:51.742 --> 17:55.510
My mom, but...

17:55.512 --> 17:58.380
she probably hates me.

17:58.382 --> 17:59.915
Why?

18:00.649 --> 18:03.316
Because I left.

18:03.318 --> 18:06.886
I ran away.

18:06.888 --> 18:08.988
I hated school,

18:08.990 --> 18:12.125
I hated our crappy
one-stop-light town,

18:12.127 --> 18:15.628
and I hated her rules.

18:15.630 --> 18:17.897
I was sick of being
treated like a kid.

18:17.899 --> 18:19.999
I thought I could make it
on my own,

18:20.001 --> 18:21.698
but then I met her.

18:21.699 --> 18:23.432
The witch?

18:23.434 --> 18:25.868
She took me in --

18:25.870 --> 18:29.271
me and two other girls.

18:29.273 --> 18:32.708
At first, we didn't
want to leave.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.577
She fed us,

18:34.579 --> 18:38.581
gave us all nice things.

18:41.552 --> 18:45.354
She was...kind.

18:45.356 --> 18:48.457
She said having us there
kept her young.

18:50.595 --> 18:53.262
But then she...

18:53.264 --> 18:55.764
She got mean.

18:55.766 --> 18:58.801
She locked us up.

18:58.803 --> 19:03.472
Rachel started getting sick,
just like this.

19:06.410 --> 19:09.645
And then Talli,
same thing.

19:11.916 --> 19:16.919
They withered away...

19:16.921 --> 19:18.587
to nothing.

19:21.425 --> 19:25.895
When your friend showed up...

19:25.897 --> 19:29.832
I thought I was saved.

19:29.834 --> 19:33.669
But then it started
taking me, too,

19:33.671 --> 19:36.906
even faster
than the others.

19:41.445 --> 19:45.848
Cass is gonna
fix this.

19:45.850 --> 19:48.017
I promise.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.861
Dean?

19:58.863 --> 20:02.698
Dean, what is it?

20:02.700 --> 20:05.267
She's got a light foot,
but she's still leaving tracks.

20:05.269 --> 20:06.869
Okay, hold up, hold up.
Wait -- Wait a second.

20:06.871 --> 20:08.304
What?

20:08.306 --> 20:09.805
Her face.

20:09.807 --> 20:11.340
You saw it, too --
the bruises.

20:11.342 --> 20:12.608
That could've been vamps.

20:12.610 --> 20:15.411
Or it could've been Michael.
Come on.

20:15.413 --> 20:17.846
Three vamps in Sioux Falls
and not a single civilian death.

20:17.848 --> 20:20.683
That's not an accident.
I think <i>they</i> were hunting <i>her.</i>

20:20.685 --> 20:21.984
Why?

20:21.986 --> 20:23.686
I think because
Michael sent them

20:23.688 --> 20:25.654
to finish what he started.
- Okay, we don't know that.

20:25.656 --> 20:28.657
Jody tested the bodies, Dean.
They're different.

20:28.659 --> 20:30.793
They're -- They're
immune to Dead Man's Blood

20:30.795 --> 20:32.127
the same way
Michael's werewolves

20:32.129 --> 20:34.597
were immune to silver.

20:38.669 --> 20:39.702
Doesn't change the plan.

20:39.704 --> 20:42.371
Yeah, but, Dean...

21:21.912 --> 21:25.481
Cantamen solvatur,

21:25.483 --> 21:28.584
cantamen revertatur.

21:28.586 --> 21:31.587
Cantamen solvatur,

21:31.589 --> 21:34.723
cantamen revertatur.

21:34.725 --> 21:37.693
Cantamen solvatur,

21:37.695 --> 21:40.195
cantamen revertatur.

21:49.740 --> 21:51.573
How are you feeling?

21:51.575 --> 21:55.110
I-I-I don't know.

22:00.384 --> 22:02.284
Lora?

22:02.286 --> 22:04.853
No.

22:04.855 --> 22:07.189
No.

22:07.191 --> 22:09.024
Help.

22:09.026 --> 22:10.726
Help.

22:31.482 --> 22:32.748
All good?

22:32.750 --> 22:35.117
Ah, the girls are
asking for me.

22:35.119 --> 22:36.618
You gonna tell them?

22:36.620 --> 22:40.289
They have a right to know,
but I can't.

22:40.291 --> 22:42.591
I promised Claire human cases
are mine,

22:42.593 --> 22:44.927
but anything monster-y,
I'd loop her in.

22:44.929 --> 22:46.228
But this...

22:46.230 --> 22:47.663
Aw.

22:47.665 --> 22:50.065
Claire's been doing so good,
and, I mean,

22:50.067 --> 22:52.434
anything connected to Kaia,
she's a powder keg.

22:52.436 --> 22:54.336
Hm.

22:54.338 --> 22:57.606
First love strikes quick,
and to lose it like that...

22:57.608 --> 22:59.174
Oh.

22:59.176 --> 23:01.009
Well, you two are having
a time of it.

23:02.279 --> 23:03.679
Yeah.

23:03.681 --> 23:05.414
He's working something out.

23:05.416 --> 23:07.416
And he's working it out alone.

23:07.418 --> 23:09.585
Only thing I know --

23:09.587 --> 23:11.520
He's not ready
for this case.

23:11.522 --> 23:13.021
Maybe.

23:13.023 --> 23:15.457
Maybe he needs it.

24:19.131 --> 24:21.298
What are you?

24:21.300 --> 24:23.767
If you're asking
if I'm the girl you knew,

24:23.769 --> 24:25.636
your Kaia,

24:25.638 --> 24:27.671
no.

24:27.673 --> 24:30.307
Then what?

24:30.309 --> 24:32.676
You're from, uh...

24:32.678 --> 24:34.144
over there, yeah?

24:34.146 --> 24:35.312
You know I am.

24:35.314 --> 24:37.181
So you're Kaia's double?

24:37.183 --> 24:38.282
Hmm?

24:38.284 --> 24:41.151
Like Bad Cass
or New Bobby.

24:41.153 --> 24:44.188
What <i>I</i> was to her,
<i>she</i> was to me,

24:44.190 --> 24:45.990
you could never
understand.

24:45.992 --> 24:47.291
Why did you kill her?

24:47.293 --> 24:50.494
That was an accident.

24:50.496 --> 24:52.663
I was trying
to kill the blonde.

24:59.805 --> 25:01.005
All right.

25:01.007 --> 25:02.706
How'd you cross over?

25:02.708 --> 25:05.676
How'd you open a rift?

25:08.648 --> 25:10.514
Okay.

25:10.516 --> 25:11.715
Why are you here?

25:11.717 --> 25:14.685
You mean right here?

25:14.687 --> 25:17.087
'Cause of him.

25:17.089 --> 25:18.923
Yeah, not him,

25:18.925 --> 25:20.524
not Michael,
not anymore.

25:20.526 --> 25:22.059
I know.

25:22.061 --> 25:23.727
You're much weaker.

25:31.504 --> 25:32.703
Maybe.

25:32.705 --> 25:34.104
But you're still scared.

25:34.106 --> 25:36.373
Not of you.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.542
Of them --

25:38.544 --> 25:41.745
the monsters
he sends after me.

25:41.747 --> 25:46.083
Every time I slow down,
there's more.

25:46.085 --> 25:48.018
There's always more.

26:10.109 --> 26:12.476
Jack...

26:15.147 --> 26:16.914
We let her die.

26:28.260 --> 26:32.663
I'm --
I'm sorry.

26:32.665 --> 26:37.501
If -- If I still had my powers,
I could've saved you.

26:37.503 --> 26:40.637
I...

27:02.828 --> 27:05.929
Jack,
what are you doing?

27:05.931 --> 27:08.532
The witch.

27:08.534 --> 27:10.601
Where's her body?

27:10.603 --> 27:11.935
Guys, we should move this,

27:11.937 --> 27:13.704
take her to the station
just to be safe.

27:13.706 --> 27:17.474
No, we need to break her
right here, right now.

27:17.476 --> 27:19.143
Break her?

27:19.573 --> 27:22.273
What do you mean "break her"?
For what?

27:22.275 --> 27:24.876
He wants to know
where I hid my weapon.

27:24.878 --> 27:27.111
That's all he wants.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.746
That's what this
is all about.

27:38.058 --> 27:41.292
The witch-killing bullet --
It's still in her.

27:41.294 --> 27:42.827
Guess so.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.496
Jack,
what is this about?

27:44.498 --> 27:46.831
Dean, what,
you're gonna hurt her?

27:46.833 --> 27:48.132
Torture her?

27:48.134 --> 27:49.801
That pig-sticker
she's hiding --

27:49.803 --> 27:52.103
it is the only thing that
we know that hurts Michael.

27:52.105 --> 27:54.272
I'm gonna do
whatever it takes.

27:59.412 --> 28:00.745
Where is it?

28:00.747 --> 28:02.914
Where's the spear?

28:02.916 --> 28:05.783
Where is it?!

28:05.785 --> 28:07.752
The witch told Lora
she and the others

28:07.754 --> 28:09.020
"kept her young."

28:09.022 --> 28:10.355
I thought
it was a metaphor,

28:10.357 --> 28:13.658
but the witch was
stealing their youth.

28:13.660 --> 28:15.527
When you killed her,

28:15.529 --> 28:18.429
maybe the magic kept working,
sucking Lora's life-force,

28:18.431 --> 28:20.999
trying to keep the witch young,
to keep her alive,

28:21.001 --> 28:22.934
but it couldn't work

28:22.936 --> 28:26.504
because the bullet
was still inside her.

28:26.506 --> 28:30.942
So the magic worked
harder and harder

28:30.944 --> 28:33.378
and consumed more and more
of Lora.

28:33.380 --> 28:36.548
That's why the reversal spell
didn't work.

28:36.550 --> 28:38.516
<i>She</i> wasn't cursed.

28:41.321 --> 28:44.522
<i>This</i> was.

28:54.501 --> 28:56.234
- Where is it?
- Dean...

28:56.236 --> 28:58.002
You're no different
than him --

28:58.004 --> 29:03.308
threats, violence,
anything to get what you want.

29:03.310 --> 29:05.877
I am nothing
like him.

29:05.879 --> 29:08.413
Yeah, you are.
You always have been.

29:19.559 --> 29:21.893
Lora's life-force --
It's in here.

29:21.895 --> 29:23.261
Jack, are you sure?

29:23.263 --> 29:24.195
No.

29:48.388 --> 29:49.887
What happened?

29:57.397 --> 30:01.099
I saw what
you did to her.

30:01.101 --> 30:03.635
When you got angry,

30:03.637 --> 30:07.372
you shoved your gun
in her face.

30:07.374 --> 30:08.573
Get in the damn car!

30:14.648 --> 30:16.948
How do you know
about that?

30:16.950 --> 30:18.449
Wait a second.

30:18.451 --> 30:20.785
You're a dreamwalker, too.

30:20.787 --> 30:22.920
Your powers --
They connected you.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.288
Our whole lives.

30:24.290 --> 30:27.458
What she saw, I saw.

30:27.460 --> 30:29.627
I know where
it comes from --

30:29.629 --> 30:32.830
your anger,
your impatience.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.465
It's fear.

30:34.467 --> 30:37.835
You're scared.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.470
And you're weak.

30:39.472 --> 30:41.639
All right. Shut up.

30:41.641 --> 30:43.841
Michael hurt you.

30:43.843 --> 30:47.512
He hurt me, too.

30:59.826 --> 31:03.628
I didn't come here
to fight.

31:03.630 --> 31:06.931
Not if I don't have to.

31:06.933 --> 31:10.968
This face you know,
but I'm just borrowing it.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.004
We haven't met.

31:13.006 --> 31:15.473
But I've sensed you

31:15.475 --> 31:17.942
ever since I came
to this world.

31:17.944 --> 31:21.646
You're like me.
You bleed new energy.

31:21.648 --> 31:23.314
So does that.

31:26.786 --> 31:29.387
I'm here
to make you an offer.

31:29.389 --> 31:31.956
There's a war coming,
and I'm building an army.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.459
You can join my side,
the winning side,

31:34.461 --> 31:36.828
if you give me that spear.

31:36.830 --> 31:40.164
Or you can fight,
definitely lose,

31:40.166 --> 31:43.334
probably die,
and then I'll just take it.

31:43.336 --> 31:47.105
So, Wild One...
what's it gonna be?

31:59.652 --> 32:01.319
Stop.

32:01.321 --> 32:03.254
You remember now?

32:14.667 --> 32:16.200
So Michael wants the spear

32:16.202 --> 32:18.536
because he knows
it can hurt him,

32:18.538 --> 32:20.772
and that's why his monsters
are coming after you.

32:20.774 --> 32:21.939
Yes.

32:21.941 --> 32:24.575
Dean, we should get
out of here.

32:24.577 --> 32:26.611
Unh-unh. Guys...

32:30.216 --> 32:32.350
Too late.

32:42.643 --> 32:45.044
We only came for her,

32:45.046 --> 32:48.180
but I was never one
to turn down a buffet.

33:27.955 --> 33:30.556
Those spiked bullets
don't hurt us anymore.

33:46.807 --> 33:49.775
Now you're in trouble.

33:54.782 --> 33:55.915
Or not.

33:55.917 --> 33:57.816
Slippery one,
isn't she?

34:01.989 --> 34:03.622
Aaah!

34:40.027 --> 34:43.027
You saved us.

34:43.030 --> 34:44.763
You didn't have to.

34:44.764 --> 34:46.799
I came back for them,
not you.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.144
You know, as long
as you have that spear,

34:59.146 --> 35:00.813
you're gonna be
a target --

35:00.815 --> 35:03.315
for Michael,
his monsters.

35:03.317 --> 35:04.717
They'll keep chasing you.

35:04.719 --> 35:06.385
I'm used to it.

35:32.742 --> 35:34.342
- Jody...
- Dean Winchester,

35:34.344 --> 35:37.545
you have
nothing to apologize for.

35:39.916 --> 35:42.116
- How is the arm?
- Yeah, you sure

35:42.118 --> 35:43.551
you don't want a ride
to the hospital or --

35:43.553 --> 35:45.953
I've driven with
a broken arm before.

35:45.955 --> 35:47.422
More worried about
what I'm gonna tell Alex

35:47.424 --> 35:48.589
when I get there.

35:48.591 --> 35:50.491
And then,
once I get home...

35:50.493 --> 35:51.726
Claire?

35:51.728 --> 35:55.096
Yeah.

35:55.098 --> 35:58.599
I'm dreading
those consequences.

35:58.601 --> 35:59.934
She's got to know.

35:59.936 --> 36:01.402
She's got to know
that Kaia's killer

36:01.404 --> 36:04.238
is still out there.

36:06.076 --> 36:09.911
You all right?

36:09.913 --> 36:13.214
It's just, you know,
seeing her face again.

36:17.587 --> 36:20.488
Raising three Hunters
and fearing every day

36:20.490 --> 36:25.293
that I might lose
one of them...

36:25.295 --> 36:27.228
Didn't really even get
a chance to know Kaia

36:27.230 --> 36:29.097
before she Di--

36:35.338 --> 36:38.906
I just feel
like I already lost

36:38.908 --> 36:41.476
before I ever even began.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.529
Come in.

37:05.034 --> 37:06.934
Well, uh...
Jules is off.

37:06.936 --> 37:10.972
She's taking Lora back home
to her mother.

37:10.974 --> 37:14.175
Jack, I just wanted to say,
I'm -- I'm sorry.

37:14.177 --> 37:16.644
I know that you've been
going through a lot lately.

37:16.646 --> 37:18.012
We've all been going
through a lot.

37:18.014 --> 37:20.114
It's just no excuse.

37:20.116 --> 37:23.618
I-I just haven't
been there for you,

37:23.620 --> 37:25.319
not the way I should've.

37:25.321 --> 37:28.623
Cass, it's okay.

37:28.625 --> 37:32.994
Well...
what you did today,

37:32.996 --> 37:37.131
you just
made me so proud.

37:37.133 --> 37:41.502
You know, learning
to hold your own in a fight

37:41.504 --> 37:43.137
without your powers,
that takes time

37:43.139 --> 37:47.742
and -- and training,
but today, you --

37:47.744 --> 37:51.379
you proved that you have
the mind of a Hunter

37:51.381 --> 37:55.249
and the heart of a Hunter.

37:55.251 --> 37:57.718
I was thinking, um...

37:57.720 --> 38:00.054
I mean, I'll talk
to Sam and Dean,

38:00.056 --> 38:02.323
but, um, I thought maybe --

38:02.325 --> 38:05.526
maybe we could
go on a Hunting trip.

38:05.528 --> 38:08.396
I mean, if you want to.

38:09.933 --> 38:10.998
Yeah.

38:13.603 --> 38:16.737
Yes.

38:23.379 --> 38:25.780
Sorry.

38:25.782 --> 38:27.448
You okay?

38:27.450 --> 38:29.750
I'm fine.

38:29.752 --> 38:32.386
I'm human now.

38:32.388 --> 38:35.089
Must be getting
my first cold.

38:35.091 --> 38:37.458
Well, I'll make you
some soup, then.

38:53.042 --> 38:55.643
I put us all in danger
today.

38:55.645 --> 38:58.713
Stupid danger.

38:58.715 --> 39:00.214
Dean...

39:00.216 --> 39:03.884
You were right.

39:03.886 --> 39:08.889
I didn't want to look at it,
what Michael used me for.

39:08.891 --> 39:11.492
I just wanted to race ahead,
you know,

39:11.494 --> 39:14.061
skip to the end of the story,
the part where I get the weapon

39:14.063 --> 39:16.163
and I take out
the bad guy --

39:16.165 --> 39:18.766
the part where
I kill Michael.

39:18.768 --> 39:22.803
Yeah, I know.

39:22.805 --> 39:26.474
You know, I said yes to him
because I thought...

39:28.645 --> 39:30.311
It was stupid.

39:30.313 --> 39:32.280
<i>I</i> was stupid.

39:32.282 --> 39:34.448
Dean...

39:34.450 --> 39:37.018
you did what
you had to do.

39:42.025 --> 39:45.693
And it wasn't a blink,

39:45.695 --> 39:49.196
being possessed.

39:49.198 --> 39:51.699
I made it sound like that,
but it wasn't.

39:54.604 --> 39:59.106
I don't remember most
of what Michael did with me

39:59.108 --> 40:02.143
because I was underwater,

40:02.145 --> 40:04.178
drowning,

40:04.180 --> 40:07.581
and that I remember.

40:07.583 --> 40:10.384
I felt every second
of it --

40:10.386 --> 40:13.521
clawing,
fighting for air.

40:16.292 --> 40:20.728
I thought I could make it out,
but I -- I...

40:20.730 --> 40:25.366
I couldn't.
I wasn't strong enough.

40:25.368 --> 40:26.834
And now he's gone

40:26.836 --> 40:29.236
and he's out there

40:29.238 --> 40:31.038
putting an army of monsters
together

40:31.040 --> 40:33.341
and he's hurting people.

40:37.480 --> 40:41.515
And it's all on me, man.

40:41.517 --> 40:43.584
I said yes.

40:47.423 --> 40:49.890
It's my fault.
