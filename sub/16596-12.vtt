00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:05.639 --> 00:07.973
Welcome to Dr. P's lab.

00:07.975 --> 00:12.211
Well, this must be important
because you're wearing
your stupid science slacks.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.114
Ha, ha!

00:15.116 --> 00:18.217
They are science-themed
emoji joggers

00:18.219 --> 00:20.185
and I wear them
like a boss.

00:23.157 --> 00:26.058
Anyway, thank you
for being my test subjects.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.726
I have separated you
because--

00:27.728 --> 00:30.029
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Science experiment.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.363
When do we get
to eat the cake?

00:32.299 --> 00:35.034
After you help me
study animal behavior.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.368
Ugh!

00:36.370 --> 00:39.204
Identical twins are unique
to the animal kingdom.

00:39.206 --> 00:42.808
You share the same DNA
so you should have the same IQ.

00:42.810 --> 00:47.246
But I am gonna prove
that's wrong by figuring out
which one of you is smarter.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.916
Okay, wait, why do people
always want twins to compete?

00:50.918 --> 00:53.552
Yeah, we're both
equally smart.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.822
-Oh, I'm smarter. Duh.
-I'm smarter.

00:58.025 --> 01:00.025
In a minute, you will do
the written IQ test.

01:00.027 --> 01:03.662
But first, your challenge
is to see who can slice a cake

01:03.664 --> 01:07.766
into eight pieces using
the fewest cuts.
Get to slicing.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.238
-I'm gonna go
check on Liv.
-A'ight.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.140
Huh?

01:16.844 --> 01:20.045
The challenge is
to slice a cake.
Why are you making a salad?

01:20.047 --> 01:26.351
Oh, well, you see,
my challenge is to always
eat healthy. So...

01:26.353 --> 01:28.754
Well, I guess Maddie
wins this round.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.762
You're supposed to cut it,
not maul it!

01:36.764 --> 01:38.263
Oh.

01:39.366 --> 01:42.167
I definitely stopped listening
after you said cake.

Hey, Ruby.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.192
Oh, hey, Joey.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.827
Aw, are you here
to see your favorite cousin?

02:41.829 --> 02:44.429
Or is it because
we're having ribs for lunch?

02:45.766 --> 02:48.433
No, uh, actually,
Liv told me that Jim Breuer

02:48.435 --> 02:49.968
is guest-starring
on the show today?

02:49.970 --> 02:52.171
Yeah, I am a huge
fan of his.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.805
He is a triple threat, Ruby.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.375
Stand-up, movies, T.V.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.477
I mean, I guess he does
comedy and all those things,

02:58.479 --> 03:00.546
so maybe he's a single threat
with multiple outlets.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.982
I'll find him for you.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.218
Which means I'm leaving you
unsupervised.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.053
Don't embarrass me.

03:12.159 --> 03:15.294
What? Donut hole pyramid!

03:15.296 --> 03:17.529
Ha, don't mind if I do.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.634
Joey:
(mouth full)
Donut hole, yeah!

03:22.636 --> 03:24.236
-Joey!
-Huh?

03:30.644 --> 03:32.344
Pleased to meet you, sir.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.479
Nice to meet you as well.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.515
Uh, yeah, we don't
need to touch.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.783
Yeah.

03:39.153 --> 03:40.752
Did I say he was my cousin?

03:40.754 --> 03:42.588
Because I've never
met him before.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.526
Yeah, don't worry
about that, Joey.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.462
You're never really
a family member until someone
pretends they don't know you.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.666
Well, Mr. Breuer, I am such
a big fan of yours.

03:54.668 --> 03:59.338
Actually, uh, I recently
dipped my toe into
the stand-up comedy pool.

03:59.340 --> 04:01.873
Oh, wow. Well, I hope
you didn't dip it into
the shallow end

04:01.875 --> 04:05.043
because that's where the kids
like to do tinkle time.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.813
See, I wanna be able
to make sophisticated jokes
just like that one.

04:09.450 --> 04:13.051
My favorite comedian
thinks I'm funny.

04:13.053 --> 04:17.256
All that time spent
performing at Quesadilla Joe's
has been worth it.

04:17.258 --> 04:19.091
And I've been thinking,
after college,

04:19.093 --> 04:21.860
I'm gonna pursue
comedy as a full-time career.

04:21.862 --> 04:25.530
I mean, it's either
stand-up comic
or dragon-slayer.

04:25.532 --> 04:29.635
But... that's all about
who you know, so.

04:29.637 --> 04:33.472
Hey, you know what?
Tonight, I'm hosting
for Open Mic Night

04:33.474 --> 04:34.606
at The Laugh Palace.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.208
I'm really tight
with the owner, Mickey.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.543
So, why don't you come down,
I'll put in a good word,

04:38.545 --> 04:40.412
maybe he'll let you
go up on stage.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.947
Are you serious?

04:41.949 --> 04:45.617
-Yeah.
-Mr. Breuer, that would
be amazing!

04:46.587 --> 04:49.921
The Laugh Palace
is big time.

04:49.923 --> 04:53.225
Doing stand-up there
can launch your career.

04:53.227 --> 04:58.063
Sorry, dragons, but
you're gonna have to find
someone else to slay you.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.833
Mr. Breuer, I hate to be
that guy, but...

05:03.237 --> 05:04.803
Could you do your
goat voice for me?

05:06.273 --> 05:07.506
Are you serious?

05:07.508 --> 05:10.575
Be that guy.
That guy pays my bills.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.311
(laughs)

05:12.313 --> 05:14.313
(bleats) Try it.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.747
(poorly imitates Jim)

05:15.749 --> 05:19.484
(both bleating)

05:19.486 --> 05:21.019
From here.
(bleats)

05:21.021 --> 05:22.654
-(bleats)
-There you go.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.692
Stop, science man.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.328
How did the, uh,
written IQ test go?

05:29.330 --> 05:31.663
Did, uh, did I win?
Am I the smart one?

05:33.300 --> 05:35.200
This isn't like
a basketball game, Maddie.

05:35.202 --> 05:39.871
There are no winners or losers.
Just data analysis to prove
a hypothesis.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.274
Yeah, totally get that.
Who won, though?

05:44.378 --> 05:47.679
Revealing my results
would compromise my
scientific integrity.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.281
-(groans)
-And besides,

05:49.283 --> 05:50.882
you'll just lord it over Liv.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.617
(gasps)

05:53.987 --> 05:58.623
Why would I lord it
over Liv unless I'm
the smart one!

05:58.625 --> 05:59.791
Bam! What?

06:02.363 --> 06:04.029
-No, no, no.
I didn't say that.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.298
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, you cannot
backpedal.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.500
I'm the smart one
and it is out there

06:08.502 --> 06:12.571
like... subatomic particles
floating through the
space-time continuum.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.873
Okay! I'm, like,
so smart.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.579
Okay, look, you did
score higher than Liv,
but you can't tell her.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.749
Okay, yeah. No,
I totally understand, Parker.

06:25.319 --> 06:27.252
I understand everything.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.028
(laughs) Mickey!

06:37.030 --> 06:39.097
-Breuer!
-Mickey!

06:39.099 --> 06:40.999
-Breuer!
-Mickey!

06:41.001 --> 06:44.002
Breuer! How long
we gonna do this?

06:45.339 --> 06:49.708
Hey. I wanna introduce you
to a very funny kid.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.611
I was hoping you would
let him go up for
Open Mic Night tonight.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.212
Hi, I'm Joey.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.248
(exhales) This is it.

06:56.250 --> 07:01.219
This is the exact point
in time where Joey Rooney
got his big break.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.088
It's my moment.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.890
No, no.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.192
It's my "Joe-ment."

07:08.529 --> 07:09.628
How old are you, kid?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.029
I'm-- I'm 17.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.098
Ooh, no way.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.100
You can't go into the club,
you're too young.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.770
But this is my dream, so...

07:19.706 --> 07:21.473
I'd really like
to work something out.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.575
Hey, I got this, Joey.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.410
Come on.

07:25.412 --> 07:26.611
No.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.613
-Oh, come on.
-No.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.315
Come on!

07:30.317 --> 07:31.450
No!

07:32.453 --> 07:34.453
Sorry, Joey,
did everything I could.

07:34.455 --> 07:35.787
Yeah.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.491
It's okay.

07:39.493 --> 07:42.661
I'll have another
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
come around real soon.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.035
Oh, Ruby,
I am so bummed.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.671
This was my chance.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.773
It was my golden opportunity.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.942
But my dream is dead

07:56.944 --> 07:58.477
and there is no fixing it.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.650
-Fixed it.
-What?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.518
Here, I looked up the law
and if they hire you to work
in the club,

08:06.520 --> 08:08.520
you can legally go in
and perform.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.858
That's amazing! You just
saved my dream.

08:12.860 --> 08:17.128
Oh, I've got another problem.
I sneezed blue yesterday.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.664
So... what's the deal
with that?

08:19.666 --> 08:21.533
Um...

08:23.704 --> 08:25.770
Did you put something
blue up there?

08:25.772 --> 08:28.240
Uh-- Oh, do blue
freezy pops count?

08:29.643 --> 08:31.843
Everything counts
when it's up your nose.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.854
(chuckles weakly)

08:46.059 --> 08:51.229
You know, now that I know
that my IQ is much higher
than Liv's,

08:51.231 --> 08:54.232
I really feel like
I have to look out for her.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.903
Or rub it in.
I could really
go either way.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.705
Hm.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.642
Oh, you poor, poor dear.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.912
Yes, remotes can be
very hard.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.947
Let me... help you.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.983
Okay.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.552
-(music on TV)
-Oh.

09:15.822 --> 09:18.256
What's happening?
Why are you
smiling so weird?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.826
What?
Mm, no reason.

09:24.364 --> 09:28.533
Okay, well something's
definitely up 'cause you've
been acting weird all day.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.469
Okay, no, I haven't.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.807
I'll, uh... just leave
this laying here in case
you need it later.

09:37.611 --> 09:41.613
Um, so Maddie,
that was grammatically
incorrect.

09:41.615 --> 09:44.950
You should actually say
I will leave this lying here.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.886
-So...
-I'm fairly certain

09:47.888 --> 09:50.355
I'm correct on this matter,
Olivia.

09:52.793 --> 09:57.762
As they say, there's, um,
more than one way
to slice a cake.

09:59.266 --> 10:03.902
Ha, ha!
Sophisticated word play?
Oh, Maddie.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.971
You are too much.

10:07.541 --> 10:10.408
Oh, and I know
I'm correct because
I, um--

10:10.410 --> 10:13.979
Oh, yeah, I scored higher
than you on the IQ test.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.047
-(gasps) You didn't!
-I did.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.150
I tricked Parker
into telling me.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.885
I outwitted him.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.621
This is something
that smart people do.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.425
(singsongy)
One, two, three, four,

10:27.427 --> 10:29.260
Maddie got the highest score.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.895
I'm smarter! Whoo, whoo!

10:30.897 --> 10:32.897
I'm smarter! Whoo, whoo!

10:32.899 --> 10:34.332
I'm smarter, I'm smarter.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.934
I'm smarter, I'm smarter.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.970
I'm smarter. Who's smarter?
I'm smarter.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.840
What did you do?

10:41.842 --> 10:44.976
Maddie says that you told her
that she scored higher
on the IQ test.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.445
And is that true? Because
I really always thought that
I was the smart one.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.981
I mean, not that I was
gonna lord it over her,
but tell me I'm smarter!

10:51.585 --> 10:53.952
-Liv, it's just a dumb test.
-Yeah.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.087
And Maddie wasn't even
supposed to say anything.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.156
Especially since
I mixed up the scores and--

10:58.158 --> 10:59.824
(gasps)

11:02.696 --> 11:07.198
If you mixed up the scores,
then that means that I'm
the smart one!

11:07.200 --> 11:11.002
I'm so smart, I figured it out!

11:11.004 --> 11:14.506
Please, do not tell Maddie.
It will ruin the integrity
of the project.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.341
Ugh, fine.
I won't tell her.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.878
(singsongy)
Five, six, seven, eight.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.379
Liv's the smartest,
and she's great!

11:21.381 --> 11:24.182
I'm smarter! Whoo, whoo!
I'm smarter!

11:24.184 --> 11:27.018
Whoo, whoo!
I'm smarter! I'm smarter!

11:27.020 --> 11:29.054
(sings high note)

11:29.956 --> 11:31.256
And I'm the better singer.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.901
Mickey!

11:43.904 --> 11:46.137
Yeah, we don't have
that relationship.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.007
Like I said, you're too young
to get inside.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.876
Oh, actually, Mr. Mickey,

11:51.878 --> 11:54.045
I checked, and I'm
allowed in the club

11:54.047 --> 11:56.047
if I'm a paid performer.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.149
But you're not,
so beat it.

11:58.151 --> 12:01.019
Just... please, give me
a shot?

12:01.021 --> 12:03.021
This is my dream.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.389
Wow.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.058
Kid with a dream,
that's interesting.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.327
Still a no.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.729
But it's interesting.

12:11.665 --> 12:14.032
Okay. Please?

12:14.034 --> 12:16.167
I promise you,
I'll do a great job.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.937
Look, I just
don't think kids are funny.
Okay?

12:18.939 --> 12:23.041
I've got four of my own
and not one of them has ever
made me laugh.

12:23.043 --> 12:27.011
Not even the skinny one
that falls all the time.
It's just so... sad.

12:29.116 --> 12:33.118
Okay, I'm sorry
about your sad kid,
but I promise you...

12:33.120 --> 12:37.255
I'll do well.
Just, please give me
the opportunity.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.958
Look, I hire comics
to get laughs.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.793
Okay? Not for
school credit.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.261
I'm sorry.

12:45.132 --> 12:48.366
Excuse me,
are you the bouncer?

12:48.368 --> 12:52.103
The bouncer? Are you serious?
A kitten could push me
out of the way.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.772
(laughing)

12:53.774 --> 12:56.241
Would tickle me with
his whiskers, that would
distract me.

12:56.243 --> 12:57.976
(laughing)

12:57.978 --> 12:59.911
You're a hoot.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.412
Are you performing tonight?

13:01.414 --> 13:03.882
Oh, thank you but,
no, no.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.751
I'm old enough to ride
the scary rides,

13:06.753 --> 13:08.820
but not old enough to perform
in that club.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.256
I asked,
but the owner said no.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.324
Ah, that's too bad.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.059
Yeah, it's okay.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.961
I'm used to hearing a no.

13:16.963 --> 13:21.332
In fact, I expect
a no with... everything
that I ask.

13:22.669 --> 13:25.804
Like, "Hey, Mom.
Can I buy a squirrel-monkey
on the Internet?"

13:25.806 --> 13:27.005
"No."

13:27.007 --> 13:29.974
"Hey cool kids,
can I sit with you?"
"No."

13:31.278 --> 13:34.012
Can I abandon everyone
and everything around me

13:34.014 --> 13:36.414
and live in a shack
in the middle of the woods
with a bunch of cats?

13:36.416 --> 13:37.982
Sadly, not yet. No.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.987
I realized, I didn't need
to get into that club.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.990
The same people that could
laugh inside,

13:45.992 --> 13:48.092
were standing outside.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.994
And I don't even
charge a cover.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.430
My "he-he's" are
free-free.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.367
So, uh,
I'm almost 18, guys.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.203
Yeah, it's exciting.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.205
Once I'm 18,
I'll be halfway to 36.

14:00.207 --> 14:02.106
Yeah.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.676
That may not sound
like a monumental age,

14:04.678 --> 14:07.045
but my mom has been
telling people that she's 36

14:07.047 --> 14:08.613
for the past 8 years.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.181
So...

14:10.183 --> 14:11.683
Must be a good age, guys.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.451
It sticks around
for a long time.

14:14.988 --> 14:17.856
I'm gonna be able to vote
in the next election,
I'm so excited.

14:17.858 --> 14:21.192
I just started
doing some research
'cause previously I thought

14:21.194 --> 14:24.529
that you just chose
between an elephant
and a donkey.

14:25.832 --> 14:28.967
No, that is not the case, guys.
They actually stand for stuff.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.237
I thought it was like a,
"Who would win in a fight?"
sort of situation.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.474
Mickey!

14:36.476 --> 14:38.476
You're not Mickey,
where's Mickey?

14:39.512 --> 14:41.012
Joey:
Do you guys
like impressions?

14:41.014 --> 14:42.480
-Crowd: Yeah.
-Joey: Yeah? Yeah.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.915
Me too.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.254
So, uh...
I have a punchable face, guys.

14:49.256 --> 14:52.156
I have this face.
It's very punchable,
I've been told.

14:52.158 --> 14:54.192
It's okay,
I've come to terms
with it.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.526
What I mean by that,

14:55.528 --> 14:57.228
is that if I was
walking down the street,

14:57.230 --> 15:00.198
and some random guy were to just
punch me in the face,

15:00.200 --> 15:03.935
I would completely understand.

15:03.937 --> 15:07.772
"I'd be like, 'Oh, no,
you're good, man.
I hate it too.'"

15:08.775 --> 15:09.841
Ha, ha!

15:19.019 --> 15:20.118
(laughs)

15:20.120 --> 15:22.287
Aw, Liv.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.390
Why take on something
so complicated?

15:25.392 --> 15:28.293
Let your wiser sister
help you.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.628
So sweet, Maddie.

15:30.630 --> 15:34.198
Yeah, you know, the instructions
actually aren't in English.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.701
But they are in a language
that you can understand.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.203
(gasps) Pictures!

15:40.941 --> 15:45.443
I setup an elaborate trap
to lure a patronizing Maddie
to her comeuppance.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.746
Cost me $50, but it
was worth it.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.015
I also got this light-up pig!

15:52.752 --> 15:54.152
-Pictures?
-Mm-hmm.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.653
Oh, no, no, no.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.389
What are you
talking about, Liv?
I'm the smarter one.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.892
Are you, Madison?
Are you?

16:03.163 --> 16:04.595
Parker messed up
the test results,

16:04.597 --> 16:06.731
and it turns out
that I have the higher IQ.

16:06.733 --> 16:09.133
Bam! What?

16:10.503 --> 16:12.403
No.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.972
No.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.406
You are just trying
to trick me

16:15.408 --> 16:16.908
but guess what?
I'm not gonna fall for it.

16:16.910 --> 16:18.643
'Cause why?
I'm more smarter.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.349
(chuckles) Okay.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.950
I didn't mean to say that.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.286
Uh, what I meant to say is...

16:28.288 --> 16:30.521
it is on!

16:30.523 --> 16:32.190
Oh, bring it!

16:32.192 --> 16:33.691
It's gonna be brought!

16:33.693 --> 16:36.094
Which is the proper conjugation!

16:36.096 --> 16:37.929
I cannot believe you.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.263
Oh, you can't believe me?

16:39.265 --> 16:40.631
Or you can't understand me

16:40.633 --> 16:42.100
because I'm so smart?

16:42.102 --> 16:44.002
Oh, yeah, smarty pants.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.671
How many...
digits of pi do you know?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.706
More than you!

16:48.708 --> 16:51.175
Both:
Three point one four
one five nine--

16:51.177 --> 16:53.511
(air horn blows)

16:53.513 --> 16:55.313
<i>Well, well, well.</i>

16:55.315 --> 16:58.082
<i>This is even better</i>
<i>than I thought it would be.</i>

16:59.119 --> 17:00.485
Parker?

17:00.487 --> 17:02.553
What are you doing
on our TV?

17:02.555 --> 17:07.025
<i>I prefer to think of it as</i>
<i>a secure location.</i>

17:07.027 --> 17:09.227
Okay, why do you
need a secure location?

17:09.229 --> 17:12.397
<i>Because you two simple</i>
<i>and predictable rats</i>

17:12.399 --> 17:15.166
<i>took the cheese</i>
<i>and proved my hypothesis.</i>

17:15.168 --> 17:17.802
Wait,
what are you talking about?

17:17.804 --> 17:21.072
You said that your hypothesis
was that one of us had
a higher IQ.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.241
<i>I say a lot of things,</i>
<i>girls.</i>

17:24.577 --> 17:26.644
<i>For the record,</i>
<i>you both have very high IQs.</i>

17:26.646 --> 17:29.047
<i>But this was not about</i>
<i>your IQs.</i>

17:29.049 --> 17:32.717
<i>The experiment was to see</i>
<i>how animals react to change</i>
<i>in status.</i>

17:32.719 --> 17:36.587
<i>It's usually performed with</i>
<i>agitated baboons, but...</i>

17:36.589 --> 17:39.824
<i>the zoo's kind of a far walk</i>
<i>and you two are right here, so.</i>

17:42.395 --> 17:46.097
Blah, blah, blah, blah,
science experiment. So wait,
which one of us is smarter?

17:46.099 --> 17:48.066
<i>It's me, girls.</i>

17:49.369 --> 17:51.736
<i>It's always been me.</i>

17:55.842 --> 17:57.575
I'm from Wisconsin.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.212
So many more food choices
here in California than we have
in Wisconsin.

18:01.214 --> 18:05.416
Like in Wisconsin, you have
fast food and you have cheese,

18:05.418 --> 18:07.018
and you settle.

18:08.922 --> 18:12.223
But here in California,
everybody's trying to get me
to try tofu.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.058
Everybody's like,
"Oh, you gotta try tofu."

18:14.060 --> 18:15.726
And I'm like, okay,
what does it taste like?

18:15.728 --> 18:18.496
And they're like,
"That's the great part.
Nothing."

18:20.133 --> 18:22.200
I'm like, okay,
no, thank you.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.035
And they're like,
"You don't understand."

18:24.037 --> 18:26.771
It tastes like whatever it's
cooked with.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.207
So if we were to cook it
with chicken,

18:29.209 --> 18:32.910
it would taste just like
the chicken that we
cooked it with.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.712
And I'm like, okay.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.315
Then I will eat the chicken

18:37.317 --> 18:38.983
that you cooked it with.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.353
And you can have the sponge.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.858
He's so funny,
I don't want to pay
to go in.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.428
Don't you see?
He's killing it!

18:50.430 --> 18:52.063
Give him a chance.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.664
Come on.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.501
Joey:
Everybody in L.A.--

18:56.503 --> 18:58.970
Everybody's, like,
trying some new diet.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.005
Right, like,
uh, Paleo?

19:01.007 --> 19:02.507
Have you guys
heard of Paleo?

19:02.509 --> 19:03.741
Yeah, with Paleo,

19:03.743 --> 19:07.912
you eat whatever a caveman
could find or prepare.

19:07.914 --> 19:12.083
So if a caveman doesn't
eat the food,
you don't eat it.

19:12.085 --> 19:15.353
'Cause everybody wants to be
just like a caveman,

19:15.355 --> 19:18.756
and live to
the ripe old age
of 27.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.427
Come on!

19:24.697 --> 19:26.931
You're just not gonna stop
until I say yes.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.599
Mickey!

19:30.537 --> 19:32.203
Living in the South,

19:32.205 --> 19:34.939
that's where the biggest bugs
are in the world.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.707
I wake up,
middle of the night,

19:36.709 --> 19:38.809
get a snack, turn on
the kitchen light--

19:38.811 --> 19:40.511
They got my dog tied up,

19:40.513 --> 19:44.849
big bug's going,
"Turn off the light.
The dog's gonna get it.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.318
Show us where
your leftovers are."

19:47.320 --> 19:51.389
I'm just... trying to get
some milk.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.659
You know when you're driving
down the street and the bugs are
smashing on your windshield?

19:54.661 --> 19:56.994
You never deal with it.
Not in the South,

19:56.996 --> 19:58.396
these bugs come looking for you

19:58.398 --> 20:00.898
three days later,
banging on your door.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.967
Open it up,
there's a whole pack of them.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.469
"Hey, is that your car
parked over there?

20:06.739 --> 20:08.472
Charlie, is this the guy?"

20:08.474 --> 20:10.508
"Let me look,
let me look.

20:10.510 --> 20:14.545
That's him, he just
left me there!"

20:14.547 --> 20:16.547
"Come outside for a second.
We want to talk to you.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.317
Bring the leftovers
and the dog."

20:23.223 --> 20:26.190
All right, well keep
those hands applauding

20:26.192 --> 20:29.694
because we have a new face
to the Laugh Palace.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.997
Please welcome Mr. Joey Rooney.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.768
Hey, how's it going, guys?

20:37.770 --> 20:39.437
-(scattered responses)
-Yeah!

20:39.439 --> 20:41.872
I just started stand-up
fairly recently.

20:41.874 --> 20:45.843
I just got my first hater
on social media.

20:45.845 --> 20:49.347
Yeah. It did not
take long for me to get a hater.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.483
It was pretty much instantly.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.286
But I got a message that said,

20:55.288 --> 20:57.355
"I don't care
what your mom tells you,

20:57.357 --> 20:59.156
you're not funny."

21:01.561 --> 21:03.828
And I was like, oh, oh.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.831
My dad has figured out
social media.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.636
I'm a paid comedian.

21:11.638 --> 21:15.239
And I defeated Mickey,
who's as scary as a dragon.

21:15.241 --> 21:17.141
Guys, I'm
living both dreams!

21:22.382 --> 21:23.881
Joey!

21:25.618 --> 21:28.586
You killed it, you did
a great job. I want to
see you back here next week.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.454
-I get to come back?
-Yeah.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.989
And go inside?

21:34.394 --> 21:36.127
Thank-- Thank you!

21:36.129 --> 21:40.831
Thank you so much,
Mickey, I can't believe it.
I feel so grown up.

I did better though, right?
