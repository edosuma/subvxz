WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:04.770
(film projector rattling)

00:10.111 --> 00:12.778
(train running)

00:30.297 --> 00:32.564
(violin music)

00:43.711 --> 00:46.578
(train braking)

00:49.150 --> 00:51.717
(violin music)

01:21.482 --> 01:23.282
(thunder sounds)

01:26.720 --> 01:29.521
- Damon, we don't have
time for this nonsense,

01:29.523 --> 01:31.607
we are late.

01:31.608 --> 01:33.692
- [Damon] I have to do
my homework, though.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.427
- Look at your sister.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.762
She's all ready.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.698
- I have seen Dad
play a million times.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.701
- Jaqueline, say
goodbye to your brother.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.670
He doesn't want to
see his father play.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.738
- All right, fine, fine.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.378
- There once was
a King of Siam...

01:53.380 --> 01:54.880
whose balls were as big as I am.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.081
[Damon] Oh, jeez!

01:56.082 --> 01:57.281
Whenever it rained...

01:57.284 --> 01:58.350
- Mom!

01:58.351 --> 01:59.417
...the balls always banged...

01:59.420 --> 02:00.478
- Why'd you teach her that?

02:00.479 --> 02:01.537
And made a big
sound in the rain.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.596
- She's only eight.

02:02.597 --> 02:03.655
- Splish, splash. The balls
always crashed. And one day

02:03.657 --> 02:05.391
when it rained, they
almost got mashed.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.126
- Okay, shhh! Stop it. Stop it.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.860
So now when it rains,
the king still remains,

02:08.862 --> 02:10.596
But seated and quiet at last.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.899
(piano music)

02:57.811 --> 03:00.245
(Humming) And you
two move together,

03:00.247 --> 03:02.181
and you follow,

03:02.183 --> 03:04.383
and wheee! You fly in,

03:04.384 --> 03:06.584
and try to take over
this note's place.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.720
And you battle and
battle! Ya! Ya!

03:08.722 --> 03:12.591
Seven notes, seven
days in a week.

03:12.593 --> 03:17.529
Oooh, I am... tired.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.912
- Hey guess what?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.864
- What?

03:35.865 --> 03:37.815
- I know something about
your sister you don't.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.770
- What are you talkin' about?

03:41.771 --> 03:44.288
- You know, sometimes
when I need a smoke,

03:44.291 --> 03:45.891
you know, late at night,

03:45.893 --> 03:48.327
I open my window so
my parents can't tell.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.463
- And?

03:51.464 --> 03:52.630
- And there's your sister, man,

03:52.633 --> 03:54.299
at midnight, looking
up at the moon,

03:54.301 --> 03:55.767
and talking to your neighbor.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.236
I mean, your
neighbor's in college,

03:57.238 --> 03:58.571
what could they
be talkin' about?

03:58.572 --> 03:59.905
They're out there for hours.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.640
- You are demented
man, you know that?

04:01.642 --> 04:03.008
You are so demented.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.509
- Hi Peter.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.645
Dinner's ready.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.879
- Okay, buddy.

04:07.881 --> 04:08.981
Piggyback?

04:08.983 --> 04:10.349
- Yeah.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.483
- All right.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.419
- Bye bye, Peter.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.387
- Bye Peter.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.828
- [Mother] Come
on in for dinner.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.265
That piano is off-limits.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.608
Your father sent you
a little something.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.345
- [Jaqueline] How neat.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.681
It's New York.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.549
He'll be home soon, right?

04:44.551 --> 04:46.318
- Yes, yes he will.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.556
Shall we say grace?

04:56.830 --> 05:00.365
Father, bless us these gifts
that we are about to receive.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.483
- Feel!

05:20.321 --> 05:21.320
Damn it.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.028
- Dad?

05:52.519 --> 05:53.752
- Yeah, this is it.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.689
(gasping)

06:00.894 --> 06:02.894
- Can I help you, Dad?

06:02.896 --> 06:04.029
- Jaqueline?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.498
You should knock first.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.499
Don't,

06:09.770 --> 06:12.771
don't you have work to be doing?

06:13.807 --> 06:16.975
- I just wanted to ask,

06:17.978 --> 06:20.379
Mom said you're
going away again.

06:21.648 --> 06:22.748
Can't I go?

06:24.718 --> 06:27.919
It might be your last concert?

06:27.921 --> 06:29.721
How many do you need?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.056
One, two?

07:06.593 --> 07:09.661
- The early threat
to the primary tonic,

07:10.431 --> 07:12.697
causes unrest.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.438
- [Damon] Hey Jackie, buddy,

07:19.440 --> 07:20.839
where's my little trainer?

07:21.675 --> 07:23.842
- Mister Muscles is calling.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.545
Go ahead.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.820
Less important than a football.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.828
- There she is.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.731
(rock music on boombox)

07:46.733 --> 07:47.732
- Ready for this?

07:47.733 --> 07:48.732
- Yeah, I'm ready.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.010
- Three, two, one, now!

08:02.783 --> 08:03.915
Want to add some more?

08:03.917 --> 08:05.116
- More? Yeah. Let's do it.

08:09.923 --> 08:10.755
- Another.

08:10.757 --> 08:11.756
- Another?

08:12.759 --> 08:13.725
We'll do both at the same time.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.694
Here we go, all right.

08:15.696 --> 08:16.561
Hit it.

08:16.563 --> 08:17.562
- Yep.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.667
(rock music)
(lyrics muffled)

08:22.669 --> 08:24.124
Come on faster.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.580
Faster! Faster, faster!

08:25.581 --> 08:27.036
- I'm going as fast as I can.
Yeah, help me out with that.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.244
Oooh! You gotta be
faster than that!

08:32.246 --> 08:34.846
(squealing)

08:37.217 --> 08:39.518
All right. Here we go.

08:39.520 --> 08:43.054
- Will you ever turn off
this ridiculous noise.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.523
This is so insulting.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.791
No shape, no progression.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.026
- Keep counting.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.260
What are you doing?

08:51.932 --> 08:54.433
Where, what is this?

08:54.434 --> 08:56.935
Mechanical static, garbage.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.304
Pumping and pumping.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.006
You don't have to insult me,

09:01.008 --> 09:02.874
you choose to do so.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.243
- Hey, put it back.

09:05.245 --> 09:08.947
- It doesn't even stop
when you want it to stop.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.249
- Hey, hey that's mine.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.084
Hey, I paid a lot of
money for that, you jerk!

09:13.086 --> 09:14.286
Give me that back.

09:14.288 --> 09:15.554
Give me that back.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.111
I paid my own money for that.

09:17.112 --> 09:18.667
- [Dad] Hey, take
your hands off me.

09:18.668 --> 09:20.223
I dare you to touch
me, you little punk.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.560
I dare you.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.294
- [Damon] Don't do it.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.262
Don't you do it.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.229
That was so expensive.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.196
Don't do it.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.148
(boombox crashes)

09:27.149 --> 09:29.099
(confused yelling)

09:33.106 --> 09:36.975
(gentle instrumental music)

09:50.691 --> 09:52.791
(piano music)

10:02.936 --> 10:05.203
(humming)

10:08.909 --> 10:10.609
- That's it, see?

10:11.378 --> 10:13.812
It's as gentle as that.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.680
We can create this. Try again.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.634
(horn honking)

10:39.940 --> 10:40.905
(city traffic noise)

11:04.331 --> 11:07.332
(classical music)

11:15.175 --> 11:16.841
- Isn't it great?

11:21.214 --> 11:22.681
Some old record,

11:24.217 --> 11:25.717
left out on the street.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.289
That's what you
find in the village.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.224
Valuable leftovers.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.798
Do you know this piece?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.468
- I am... familiar with it.

11:50.977 --> 11:54.946
(solo violin)

12:05.392 --> 12:07.092
- You have to play for me.

12:11.465 --> 12:12.464
Sometime.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.735
You've tolerated my
playing plenty of times.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.136
- You play well.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.306
- No, no, I'm just
looking for compliments.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.774
- You play with soul.

12:23.777 --> 12:24.776
That's the thing.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.996
I like your playing.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.181
- Anyway, you wouldn't
have to be great to...

12:30.183 --> 12:32.450
- Could we actually
change the music?

12:34.154 --> 12:35.153
Please?

12:36.022 --> 12:37.021
- Oh. Sure.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.428
- Something I've never heard.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.801
(acoustic guitar)

12:49.803 --> 12:54.906
¶ I grow gardenias for Rita. ¶

12:55.909 --> 13:00.178
¶ In my one room
apartment downtown. ¶

13:02.916 --> 13:07.051
¶ In the window
overlooking fifth street. ¶

13:09.356 --> 13:12.423
- Violin really has always
been my favorite instrument.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.025
- Shh, sh sh sh.

13:20.934 --> 13:24.335
(soft orchestral music)

13:44.457 --> 13:45.456
- Stop.

13:50.163 --> 13:54.265
You must be in complete
control before you start.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.835
Don't start before you're ready.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.204
The second note, the B flat,

14:01.107 --> 14:05.043
must draw us into
the opening phrase.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.044
Hmm?

14:39.279 --> 14:41.145
Okay, let's move on.

14:44.651 --> 14:48.253
The slower part of this movement

14:49.522 --> 14:52.423
dee da da da.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.394
That has been somewhat too slow,

14:56.396 --> 14:59.397
so you want to take
that up a notch, yes?

15:08.074 --> 15:11.042
Well, it'll get better,
don't you worry.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.912
- Where is Mom?

15:13.914 --> 15:15.480
- Around here somewhere.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.965
Anyway, don't worry too much

15:16.966 --> 15:18.449
about the parts
that need fixing.

15:18.451 --> 15:21.319
The Saturday competition
gives us enough time.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.320
- Larry?

15:23.390 --> 15:24.255
Lawrence.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.456
Hi.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.325
It's such a pleasure to see you.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.929
I wanted to speak to you about
an upcoming concert with...

15:31.965 --> 15:34.299
Oh, I'm sorry dear
Jaqueline, hello.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.635
Your father didn't tell me that

15:36.636 --> 15:38.970
he had a daughter that was
almost as genius as he is.

15:39.639 --> 15:42.206
So Larry, Lawrence,

15:42.208 --> 15:43.207
Mister Archer.

15:43.209 --> 15:45.143
- Stuart, Doctor Katz,

15:45.145 --> 15:46.477
we'll have to talk later.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.247
- Oh, yes. Of course.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.384
- As I was saying, the
Saturday competition,

15:53.386 --> 15:56.054
I think we can at least
use the second movement

15:56.056 --> 15:57.622
for the concerto category.

15:57.624 --> 16:02.126
Perhaps the Beethoven Spring
Sonata for the Romantic.

16:02.128 --> 16:06.397
Hello Aaron, and how did you
like my lovely daughter, hmm?

16:06.399 --> 16:08.066
- Went element successions

16:08.068 --> 16:10.101
move in parallel...

16:10.103 --> 16:13.137
they can move at different
rates of ascent and descent.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.605
- Darling.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.141
Well, I just have to say that,

16:17.143 --> 16:20.645
that dress made
you look so pretty.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.698
And I like those earrings.

16:23.699 --> 16:26.750
And from the stage, your makeup
makes your skin look fine.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.152
Don't you think so?

16:28.154 --> 16:30.555
- Lovely, absolutely lovely.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.223
- Excuse me a moment.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.182
- Well, that's moving along
in the right direction.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.685
Now you've been a bit, here,

17:00.687 --> 17:02.687
just two before nine,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.122
you've been a bit sharp here.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.522
Careful of that, yes?

17:05.525 --> 17:07.776
Yes?

17:07.777 --> 17:10.028
And let's really come
down to piano here,

17:10.030 --> 17:13.131
so we can lean into that
crescendo up to nine.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.298
Yes, try that?

17:17.604 --> 17:19.103
One, two.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.207
Let's try it again.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.608
Piano.

17:24.611 --> 17:25.710
One.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.145
One, two.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.525
Now that's not bad.

17:40.527 --> 17:45.129
Not bad, now if you practice
hard before Saturday,

17:45.131 --> 17:49.634
don't let schoolwork,
or anything else,

17:49.636 --> 17:52.236
take away your concentration,

17:52.238 --> 17:54.338
including those drama classes,

17:54.340 --> 17:56.641
that have you under their spell.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.409
We might,

18:00.313 --> 18:01.312
we might win.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.216
Excuse me a moment.

18:07.754 --> 18:11.756
One slip makes a difference.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.757
Work on it.

18:12.759 --> 18:18.863
And remember, no one can
take my rightful place.

18:27.307 --> 18:27.839
(coughing)

18:27.840 --> 18:28.372
One piont less, Jaqueline.

18:41.221 --> 18:45.389
(avant garde instrumental music)

18:53.333 --> 18:56.134
(violin music)

19:13.319 --> 19:14.819
- Jaqueline?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.754
Do you have an answer for me?

19:16.756 --> 19:18.823
- Yes sir, of course sir. Um...

19:20.426 --> 19:22.160
By the way sir, you
look great today,

19:22.162 --> 19:23.494
the swoop of your hair.

19:23.496 --> 19:27.732
I believe the answer
you're looking for is,

19:28.801 --> 19:32.470
321.3 repeating sir.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.842
- Okay, who's next?

19:45.318 --> 19:47.485
- (Quoting) You are so refined.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.387
You have such a soft voice.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.190
Why then, do you want
to be like ordinary

19:52.192 --> 19:54.192
people who drink.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.193
- Hey Arch.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.161
- Hi.

19:57.162 --> 19:58.595
- But I like to drink.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.199
Speaking of, why don't you
come to the Blackwood party

20:01.201 --> 20:02.667
Friday night after the game?

20:04.470 --> 20:05.836
- I don't think Friday night's

20:05.838 --> 20:07.672
really going to work for me.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.707
- Really gonna work for you?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.375
What's that supposed to mean?

20:12.212 --> 20:13.277
- My Dad and I.

20:13.279 --> 20:14.278
- Dad, huh?

20:14.280 --> 20:18.516
Well, I ain't gonna
try and convince you.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.593
Blythewood party!

20:28.595 --> 20:30.995
(cheering)

20:30.997 --> 20:34.665
- [Astrov] No direct, genuine,
free attitude to people

20:34.667 --> 20:36.734
and the nature left among them.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.702
None. None!

20:39.572 --> 20:42.006
- No, I beg you, please
don't drink any more.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.409
- Why not?

20:44.410 --> 20:46.811
- You are so refined. You
have such a soft voice.

20:47.780 --> 20:48.913
- Mister Thigland?

20:49.916 --> 20:50.982
Hi.

20:50.984 --> 20:53.017
- I see you're not in class.

20:53.019 --> 20:57.655
- Well, yeah I'm supposed to
be in practice, right now.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.357
But I wanted to talk to you
about the play we're doing,

20:59.359 --> 21:00.925
and the play we're
bringing to competition.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.110
- Whoa.

21:02.111 --> 21:03.294
- And Governor's
School for the Arts,

21:03.295 --> 21:04.478
and some of the plays
you mentioned in class,

21:04.479 --> 21:05.662
I, I wanted to check out.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.664
- Slow down.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.033
What's the rush? Whoa.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.901
- [Jaqueline]
Sorry, I'm excited.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.471
- Take a deep breath.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.805
- Right.

21:14.807 --> 21:15.806
Chill.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.893
- His voice trembles
and caresses one...

21:18.894 --> 21:20.377
I can still feel it
vibrating in the air.

21:20.380 --> 21:23.014
- Would you mind
giving us a moment?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.451
- You think I can do this,

21:28.288 --> 21:29.888
don't you?

21:29.889 --> 21:31.489
I mean, I'm okay aren't I?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.624
I know you're worried about
time commitments and all,

21:33.626 --> 21:34.692
but I just,

21:34.694 --> 21:35.693
I just feel like,

21:39.565 --> 21:40.247
it's fun!

21:40.248 --> 21:40.930
- Let's talk for a second.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.801
Why don't you put that down?

21:43.803 --> 21:46.504
You're like a hit
man with that thing.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.938
I have faith in you,

21:47.940 --> 21:51.776
but I do think you're spreading
yourself a little too thin.

21:51.778 --> 21:54.879
- After tomorrow,
I'm free and clear.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.548
I'll make it up to
them, I promise.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.550
I know I can do this.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.522
- My chips are on you, kid.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.723
But I did have to consider
someone as a backup.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.593
Hey, look at it this way,

22:09.595 --> 22:12.563
you're the only one
with an understudy.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.998
- I'm going to do this play.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.766
The closing monologue is mine.

22:23.876 --> 22:27.678
- What is she doing in there?

22:27.680 --> 22:30.614
What does she think
she's playing out there?

22:30.616 --> 22:31.482
- [Mother] Larry!

22:31.484 --> 22:32.483
- Don't--

22:34.020 --> 22:35.786
- There's a competition
coming up and

22:35.788 --> 22:36.987
she's noodling on the piano!

22:51.037 --> 22:53.037
So, let me know when you want

22:53.039 --> 22:55.906
to run through the program
for tomorrow's competition.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.044
- Okay.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.825
(piano music)

24:31.003 --> 24:32.002
- Ready?

25:55.922 --> 25:58.722
- So, I think we
might want to use that

25:58.724 --> 26:00.291
for the romantic category.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.298
I should probably
go back up to bed.

26:48.074 --> 26:52.009
(surreal instrumental music)

27:43.162 --> 27:44.862
- Archer,

27:44.864 --> 27:46.263
you came.

27:46.265 --> 27:47.264
Excellent.

27:51.203 --> 27:53.137
Hey guys, look who's here.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.373
- [Woman] Did she
bring her violin too?

27:59.311 --> 28:02.680
(romantic pop music)

28:47.927 --> 28:49.226
- You made it.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.227
That's so great.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.449
- Holy...

29:12.451 --> 29:14.351
- Cut it.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.892
Oh. Whoa.

29:21.894 --> 29:24.128
(grunting)

29:28.134 --> 29:29.133
Wait. Wait.

29:29.135 --> 29:32.169
- I'm gonna want to
remember this tree.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.039
- Wait.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.040
No.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.176
(gasps)

29:40.346 --> 29:41.378
No.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.847
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.149
No.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.784
Wait.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.890
No. Stop. Wait.

29:54.226 --> 29:59.363
No, no. (slightly sobbing)

30:00.099 --> 30:03.233
(crying)

30:07.139 --> 30:08.138
(painful moaning)

30:48.914 --> 30:50.113
- Sleep well?

30:50.115 --> 30:51.114
- Mm-hmm.

30:53.919 --> 30:55.452
- Shall we?

30:55.453 --> 30:56.986
- Yes, go through the
program before we leave.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.030
- Got it.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.398
Now let me see.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.335
Wait.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.137
Wait.

31:13.138 --> 31:14.938
Hold on, just let me
get this blackhead.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.540
- Mom, stop!

31:20.012 --> 31:21.311
- There's more coffee.

31:29.488 --> 31:32.623
(metronome ticking)

32:58.110 --> 32:59.109
- Done.

33:15.728 --> 33:17.194
- What was that about?

33:18.263 --> 33:19.463
- I'm so glad it's over.

33:19.465 --> 33:20.430
- Over?

33:21.400 --> 33:23.400
It's not over.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.601
This is just the beginning.

33:24.603 --> 33:25.602
- Don't say that.

33:29.375 --> 33:32.676
- Many of my best shows,
I was about your age.

33:34.113 --> 33:37.681
- We shall live through a
long, long chain of days,

33:37.683 --> 33:40.150
and weary evenings.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.636
We shall work for others,

33:42.637 --> 33:45.121
both now and in our old
age and have no rest.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.523
- You cannot do this play.

33:46.525 --> 33:47.624
- Dad?

33:47.625 --> 33:48.724
- It'll split your focus.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.294
All it takes,

33:55.067 --> 33:59.736
is one point less
to change your life.

33:59.738 --> 34:02.305
- It's unlikely I'll ever
be at that level, Dad.

34:02.307 --> 34:04.341
- You have to concentrate.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.377
You never know.

34:25.330 --> 34:26.596
I have some plans.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.742
(piano music)

34:41.746 --> 34:43.080
- There they are!

34:43.081 --> 34:48.118
The famous musicians
of the house.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.652
Why don't you play us something?

34:49.655 --> 34:50.754
- I don't think so.

34:58.764 --> 35:02.232
- So, how did it go?

35:06.138 --> 35:07.137
- Okay.

35:07.873 --> 35:09.673
- Just okay, huh?

35:11.844 --> 35:15.278
Well, I had to try
several places,

35:15.280 --> 35:17.781
since milk and cereal
were not on sale,

35:17.783 --> 35:20.350
and that left me very
little time to wash my hair,

35:20.352 --> 35:23.787
but I made it just in
the nick of time, too.

35:25.791 --> 35:29.493
(clearing his throat)

35:29.495 --> 35:31.194
Is Jaqueline all right?

35:31.196 --> 35:32.662
I mean is anything wrong?

35:32.664 --> 35:35.232
She certainly acted
saucy a minute ago.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.801
- Selfish, that's what she is.

35:38.871 --> 35:40.537
What do you expect?

35:44.543 --> 35:47.410
I told her about the
wonderful opportunity

35:47.412 --> 35:50.380
I set up for her this
week, with Doctor Portman,

35:50.382 --> 35:53.917
and she is just completely
disregarding it.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.838
- Any reasons?

35:57.839 --> 35:59.923
- Well, yes but, come on,

35:59.925 --> 36:01.424
a school play.

36:01.426 --> 36:05.295
- That does mean people
are depending on her honey.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.863
- I'm depending on her.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.299
- I know, and I depend
on her too but--

36:09.301 --> 36:10.901
- She's going to
split her focus.

36:10.903 --> 36:12.536
- Well.

36:12.537 --> 36:14.170
- Who does she think she is?

36:14.173 --> 36:17.641
I have provided for
her for 17 years and,

36:17.643 --> 36:19.576
this is what I get in return.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.180
- We.

36:41.733 --> 36:44.834
(dissonant violin)

37:13.899 --> 37:16.566
(rock music)

37:38.690 --> 37:43.827
¶ Where were you when
I was bargaining? ¶

37:46.498 --> 37:51.635
¶ Where were you when
I was bargaining? ¶

37:53.372 --> 37:56.806
(lyrics muffled)

38:02.481 --> 38:07.617
¶ Where were you when
I was bargaining? ¶

38:08.887 --> 38:11.821
(lyrics muffled)

38:35.681 --> 38:38.715
(soft piano music)

38:44.423 --> 38:46.489
- Right on the dot.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.083
You are like clockwork.

38:51.084 --> 38:52.472
You know, I'll bet you're
one of those people

38:52.473 --> 38:53.861
who is always just
a little bit early.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.466
- Ben?

38:58.003 --> 38:59.402
What is this?

39:03.709 --> 39:04.841
- Let me think.

39:04.842 --> 39:05.974
Just a special dish I
think you might like.

39:07.346 --> 39:08.845
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

39:11.883 --> 39:13.483
- It's...

39:17.022 --> 39:19.689
- So... nice.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.891
- Why don't you put
your things down?

39:21.893 --> 39:24.894
Take your coat
off, stay a while.

39:35.774 --> 39:36.806
What is this?

39:37.909 --> 39:40.777
- Just a valuable leftover.

39:41.713 --> 39:42.912
I found it on the street.

39:42.914 --> 39:45.014
I just need to clean it off.

39:48.687 --> 39:50.487
- I hope the music is okay.

39:51.423 --> 39:52.489
There's no violin.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.903
- It almost fits.

40:08.473 --> 40:09.472
- Wow.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.108
- Handsome guy.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.910
- Yeah, he is.

40:16.548 --> 40:17.947
Ben, this is just,

40:20.452 --> 40:21.451
thank you.

40:21.453 --> 40:24.888
- I wouldn't have taken
you for the military type.

40:25.657 --> 40:26.656
- Hmm?

40:30.762 --> 40:32.529
That's my brother.

40:33.565 --> 40:34.731
- Oh.

40:34.733 --> 40:37.033
(laughing)

40:38.470 --> 40:39.436
Let's eat.

40:49.047 --> 40:50.747
- Well?

40:53.084 --> 40:54.434
Come on, Ben.

40:54.435 --> 40:55.785
Where did you learn
to cook like this?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.587
- It's nothing special really.

41:00.459 --> 41:03.726
(in Polish) Jedzcie pijcie
i popus zczajcie pasa!

41:05.964 --> 41:07.096
- What the hell?

41:07.098 --> 41:09.699
- This is a magical Polish dish.

41:10.669 --> 41:14.838
If it works, I find out
all of your secrets.

41:17.476 --> 41:20.910
(in Polish) Smacznego!

41:20.912 --> 41:22.779
Now I know you have
an older brother,

41:22.781 --> 41:27.250
and I always thought
you were an only child.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.754
(light piano music)

41:34.759 --> 41:35.625
- Mmm.

41:35.627 --> 41:36.626
- Mmm, hmm.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.027
(laughs)

41:38.029 --> 41:39.229
Try it with this.

41:39.231 --> 41:40.230
Mmm!

41:44.769 --> 41:47.570
(violin music)

42:01.520 --> 42:04.587
- We shall live through a
long, long chain of days,

42:04.589 --> 42:06.523
and weary evenings.

42:06.525 --> 42:10.059
We shall patiently bear the
trials which fate sends us.

42:12.697 --> 42:15.698
(classical music)

42:17.102 --> 42:19.569
(snoring)

42:36.688 --> 42:38.955
(snoring)

43:27.806 --> 43:28.938
(pills rattle)

43:48.326 --> 43:50.693
(musicians practicing)

44:38.343 --> 44:41.811
(intense piano music)

44:45.383 --> 44:46.382
(sighs)

44:54.793 --> 44:55.792
(breathes deeply)

44:59.898 --> 45:01.831
We shall hear the angels.

45:02.767 --> 45:06.302
We shall see all heaven
lit with radiance.

45:08.006 --> 45:10.373
We shall see Earthly evil,

45:11.409 --> 45:13.843
all our sufferings,

45:13.845 --> 45:17.213
drowned in the mercy which
will fill the whole world,

45:23.188 --> 45:26.355
and our life will be peaceful,

45:27.759 --> 45:31.360
gentle, and sweet as a caress.

45:32.997 --> 45:35.732
(piano music)

45:38.937 --> 45:42.338
We shall rest.
(knocking on door)

45:43.308 --> 45:45.041
(knocking harder)

46:03.862 --> 46:05.795
(musicians practice)

46:23.214 --> 46:24.781
- What are you doin'?

46:24.783 --> 46:26.249
Your poor Dad's
worried sick about you,

46:26.251 --> 46:29.452
and you're in here what,
playin' with yourself?

46:30.989 --> 46:33.523
(jazzy piano)

46:43.001 --> 46:44.000
- Wheee! (laughs)

46:45.036 --> 46:46.191
- Cool.

46:46.192 --> 46:47.347
- I thought you'd like that.

46:47.348 --> 46:48.503
Okay, go put your clothes on,

46:48.506 --> 46:49.972
and get with it, will ya?

46:49.973 --> 46:51.439
Your Dad looked like he was
gonna have a heart attack.

46:51.442 --> 46:52.441
- Right? Thanks.

46:52.443 --> 46:55.111
- You know, he's kinda
cute when he's anxious.

46:55.113 --> 46:56.412
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

46:56.414 --> 46:57.346
- I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

46:57.348 --> 46:58.915
I gotta--

46:58.916 --> 47:00.483
- Look, you have one year left.

47:00.485 --> 47:02.151
- Yeah, then what?

47:02.153 --> 47:03.853
- Any word from your brother?

47:04.489 --> 47:05.922
- No.

47:05.924 --> 47:08.057
Look, I may need your help.

47:08.893 --> 47:10.593
- Are you gonna tell Pops?

47:10.595 --> 47:12.361
- No. It's just I thought,

47:12.363 --> 47:13.362
I might.

47:14.432 --> 47:16.032
- Go meet with him.

47:16.034 --> 47:18.568
We'll talk later,
this sounds serious.

47:19.337 --> 47:21.304
Go, go.

47:21.305 --> 47:23.272
And, we'll improvise soon,

47:23.274 --> 47:25.074
whether you like it or not.

47:25.076 --> 47:26.075
Now go.

47:27.412 --> 47:30.880
(intense piano music)

47:43.261 --> 47:46.395
(metronome ticking)

48:09.921 --> 48:11.799
- Where were you?

48:11.800 --> 48:13.678
I was looking for you.

48:13.679 --> 48:15.557
- Downstairs bathroom, we
had no toilet paper up here.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.193
Feminine hygiene, you know.

48:19.030 --> 48:20.663
- If you were living at home

48:20.664 --> 48:22.297
I don't think we'd be
having these problems.

48:22.300 --> 48:23.299
- Sorry.

48:25.503 --> 48:28.104
- It affects our performance
when you're late for rehearsal.

48:28.106 --> 48:29.438
The slightest mis--

48:32.577 --> 48:33.643
Let's get started.

48:36.648 --> 48:39.949
- Actually Dad, I
need to cancel today.

48:39.951 --> 48:43.052
- Hmm?

48:43.053 --> 48:46.154
- I'm in some pain, I thought
I'd go to the medical center,

48:47.058 --> 48:49.191
see if everything's all right.

48:49.193 --> 48:51.694
- We're behind schedule
for the next performance.

48:54.198 --> 48:55.197
I'll go with you.

48:55.199 --> 48:56.577
- I can go alone.

48:56.578 --> 48:57.956
- If you're not feeling well,

48:57.957 --> 48:59.335
and it's serious enough
to seek medical attention,

48:59.337 --> 49:00.503
I'm coming with you.

49:00.505 --> 49:01.938
- You should stay and work.

49:01.940 --> 49:03.139
I'm sure it's nothing.

49:03.141 --> 49:04.807
- Let's get going.

49:04.808 --> 49:06.474
- It's a private thing,
I don't want you there.

49:18.957 --> 49:20.356
Damon, wish me luck.

49:21.960 --> 49:23.559
- [Director] Okay, next?

49:27.598 --> 49:29.532
- Jaqueline, surprised
to see you here.

49:29.534 --> 49:30.533
Good luck.

49:32.470 --> 49:33.336
- Okay.

49:33.338 --> 49:34.337
You may go now.

49:47.285 --> 49:49.552
Number 32, Jaqueline Archer.

49:51.122 --> 49:52.121
- Hello.

49:53.057 --> 49:54.357
- Whenever you're ready.

50:01.332 --> 50:03.599
- There is nothing for it.

50:04.669 --> 50:06.402
We must go on living.

50:07.438 --> 50:10.406
We shall live through a
long, long chain of days

50:10.408 --> 50:12.208
and weary evenings.

50:13.077 --> 50:14.844
- Jaqueline?

50:14.845 --> 50:16.612
Allow your own
feelings to surface.

50:17.548 --> 50:18.614
- I'm sorry.

50:19.617 --> 50:20.750
I shouldn't be here.

50:20.752 --> 50:22.318
- Might as well try.

50:23.388 --> 50:25.087
Yes?

50:25.089 --> 50:26.055
Keep going.

50:26.057 --> 50:30.226
Make it your thoughts, and
not someone else's thoughts.

50:47.678 --> 50:52.515
- We shall patiently bear the
trials which fate sends us.

50:55.620 --> 50:57.720
We shall work for others,

50:57.722 --> 51:01.457
both now and in our old
age and have no rest.

51:03.494 --> 51:05.594
And when our time comes,

51:05.596 --> 51:07.630
we shall die without a murmur.

51:09.600 --> 51:11.600
And there, beyond the grave,

51:11.602 --> 51:14.804
we shall see a life
that is beautiful,

51:16.774 --> 51:21.410
peaceful, and sweet as a caress.

51:22.814 --> 51:24.346
We shall rest,

51:26.551 --> 51:27.850
we shall rest.

51:27.852 --> 51:29.819
- Okay, let's stop.

51:29.821 --> 51:33.322
Jaqueline, I see you're
not a theater major.

51:34.358 --> 51:36.392
Have you worked on
this piece before?

51:38.830 --> 51:39.829
Okay.

51:41.466 --> 51:43.365
Well here are the
rehearsal dates.

51:43.367 --> 51:44.767
I want you to take
a look at this

51:44.769 --> 51:47.336
and make sure you don't
have any conflicts.

51:48.573 --> 51:51.574
Be sure and take a look
at that closing monologue.

51:51.576 --> 51:53.642
- I love the closing monologue.

51:53.644 --> 51:54.577
- Really?

51:56.114 --> 51:58.214
Okay, we're gonna
be calling people

51:58.216 --> 51:59.448
in a couple of days.

51:59.450 --> 52:00.783
Thank you.

52:00.785 --> 52:02.618
- Great, great!

52:03.521 --> 52:04.520
Thank you.

52:05.289 --> 52:06.655
Thank you very much.

52:07.525 --> 52:08.524
- Good luck.

52:22.673 --> 52:25.674
(tires squealing)

52:26.677 --> 52:28.310
(engine knocking)

52:28.312 --> 52:29.311
- Shit.

52:29.914 --> 52:31.313
You okay?

52:31.315 --> 52:32.181
- I'm fine.

52:32.183 --> 52:32.999
- I'm so sorry.

52:33.000 --> 52:33.816
Let me just, could I?

52:33.818 --> 52:35.151
- Really.

52:35.153 --> 52:35.885
- Can I take you somewhere?

52:35.887 --> 52:36.886
- I'm fine.

52:38.723 --> 52:40.689
Are you from New York?

52:40.691 --> 52:42.158
- You can tell?

52:42.160 --> 52:43.459
- I love New York.

52:43.461 --> 52:45.378
- Have you ever lived there?

52:45.379 --> 52:47.296
- No, I've been
there a lot as a kid.

52:47.298 --> 52:48.764
My Dad performed there a bunch.

52:48.766 --> 52:49.899
- My Mom lives upstate.

52:49.901 --> 52:51.367
I gotta drive back soon.

52:52.336 --> 52:53.736
Got a taste for the grit, huh?

52:53.738 --> 52:54.703
- The grit?

52:56.541 --> 52:57.773
- Don't worry about it.

53:00.444 --> 53:01.577
- Oh shit.

53:01.579 --> 53:02.545
- What?

53:02.547 --> 53:03.612
- What time is it?

53:03.614 --> 53:04.713
- Half past, I think.

53:04.715 --> 53:05.681
- Shit.

53:05.683 --> 53:07.416
Shit.

53:07.418 --> 53:08.851
I gotta go to the music
school and get my violin.

53:08.853 --> 53:10.252
I'm, I'm late. I'm late!

53:10.254 --> 53:11.787
Oh, God!

53:11.789 --> 53:13.072
- Okay okay okay,
just calm down and.

53:13.073 --> 53:14.356
- Rehearsal's at the
performing arts center

53:14.358 --> 53:15.558
near the stadium.

53:15.560 --> 53:16.725
Do you know where that is?

53:16.727 --> 53:17.726
- Yep.

53:19.564 --> 53:20.563
Hop in.

53:25.770 --> 53:28.004
Egads.

53:28.005 --> 53:30.239
What would happen
if you were late?

53:31.609 --> 53:32.608
Hold on.

53:33.344 --> 53:35.945
(car starting)

53:37.448 --> 53:40.449
(tires squealing)

53:41.586 --> 53:44.253
(rock music)

53:48.993 --> 53:50.759
(engine knocking)

53:50.761 --> 53:52.361
It sticks sometimes.

53:53.464 --> 53:54.463
Don't worry.

53:55.766 --> 53:56.899
Hey.

53:56.901 --> 53:58.234
Don't forget this.

53:58.236 --> 53:59.535
- Oh!

53:59.537 --> 54:00.970
Gonna be in a play, huh?

54:00.972 --> 54:02.822
- No, no.

54:02.823 --> 54:04.673
I won't get the
part. Even if I um...

54:06.544 --> 54:07.676
I don't think I can.

54:08.713 --> 54:09.945
- Stage fright?

54:09.947 --> 54:11.313
- It's not that. (sighs)

54:11.916 --> 54:13.949
Even if I wanted to,

54:13.951 --> 54:15.317
I don't see how.

54:16.487 --> 54:18.254
It was neat to audition though.

54:19.523 --> 54:22.024
It would make a lot of
people upset I think.

54:22.026 --> 54:23.025
- I don't follow.

54:24.795 --> 54:26.595
- I don't think my
Dad would like it.

54:26.597 --> 54:27.997
- So?

54:27.999 --> 54:29.798
- It would make him very upset.

54:30.735 --> 54:31.734
- So?

54:33.604 --> 54:36.138
- My life is set.

54:36.139 --> 54:38.673
Wear black, and play
the music of dead men.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.312
I gotta go.

54:45.850 --> 54:46.849
Thank you.

54:48.953 --> 54:51.654
(car starting)

54:51.656 --> 54:54.523
(chamber music)

55:10.841 --> 55:12.708
Excuse me. Excuse me.

55:18.616 --> 55:20.616
(clears throat)

55:20.618 --> 55:23.419
- Do you see what your
colleagues are doing?

55:23.988 --> 55:24.987
- Um...

55:26.457 --> 55:28.857
We are waiting for you.

55:28.859 --> 55:29.858
- Right.

55:34.832 --> 55:36.865
- Do you see what I'm doing?

55:36.867 --> 55:39.868
- You're... not playing?

55:44.542 --> 55:45.874
- Okay, let's go.

55:58.356 --> 56:01.023
(sexual moaning)

56:40.831 --> 56:43.532
- Well, they can't
keep this up all night.

56:44.535 --> 56:47.569
(sexual screaming)

57:08.859 --> 57:11.860
(acoustic guitar)

57:12.830 --> 57:16.198
¶ Lullaby ¶

57:16.200 --> 57:19.735

58:32.076 --> 58:37.212
¶ You used to be a happy girl ¶

¶ Lullabye ¶

01:01:26.417 --> 01:01:28.350
- You know if you stayed at home

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:30.252
I wouldn't have to
drive all the way

01:01:30.254 --> 01:01:32.688
in here just to
rehearse with you.

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:34.056
Your mother would
be much happier.

01:01:34.058 --> 01:01:36.291
She really misses you.

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:38.243
If you lived at home,

01:01:38.244 --> 01:01:40.194
she could be fixing your
breakfast right now.

01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:47.969
So is everything okay?

01:01:52.443 --> 01:01:54.843
What did they say
about the pain?

01:01:55.913 --> 01:01:58.346
If you lived at home we
could take care of you,

01:01:58.348 --> 01:02:00.849
and you wouldn't be
having these problems.

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:02.417
- I can't.

01:02:02.419 --> 01:02:03.418
- What?

01:02:04.855 --> 01:02:06.888
Don't you dare go away from me.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.391
We are having a talk right now.

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.259
Just tell me one good reason

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:13.428
why you can't pay us
rent, and live at home.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.131
You obviously can't
take care of yourself.

01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:18.000
What is wrong with you?

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:19.868
- Nothing's wrong with me,
let me go to the bathroom.

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:23.105
- No no no, no no, no more!

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:24.740
No, you,

01:02:24.742 --> 01:02:27.342
you are not going to avoid me.

01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:31.246
You are going to behave like
a normal, obedient daughter,

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.749
as hard as that
might be for you.

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:35.317
Now, tell me,

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:38.520
what did the doctor
say yesterday?

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:40.756
- He said I can't play
music with you anymore,

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:42.824
it causes too much stress.

01:02:42.826 --> 01:02:47.963
- You are so selfish.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:49.765
What do you hear?

01:03:03.013 --> 01:03:04.379
- Dad, Dad.

01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:16.558
- I just want to
know you're okay.

01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:21.797
- Everything's all right, Dad.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:25.967
- You sure?

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:28.270
- I didn't,

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:32.007
everything's okay.

01:03:33.343 --> 01:03:34.810
I promise.

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:46.955
- So that was a pretty good
rehearsal after all, right?

01:03:46.957 --> 01:03:47.956
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:51.126
- And what time are we tomorrow?

01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:51.993
- One o'clock.

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:52.994
- Right.

01:03:54.231 --> 01:03:57.299
Oh, um, you want
to get some lunch?

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:00.001
- I'd like to but,

01:04:00.571 --> 01:04:01.837
I really can't.

01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:04.306
- Maybe tomorrow.

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:05.307
- I'm not sure.

01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:08.376
- Okay.

01:04:11.148 --> 01:04:16.284
- Bye.

01:04:19.256 --> 01:04:21.289
- A boo ba do ba doo.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:23.391
(singing) A shoo ma noo ma noo.

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:25.093
A shu be do bap bap bah!

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:26.094
- No.

01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:29.264
- A bap bap bah.

01:04:29.266 --> 01:04:31.083
No!

01:04:31.084 --> 01:04:32.901
- You only have to play
one, maybe two notes.

01:04:32.903 --> 01:04:35.136
I'll bet your Dad
and Gould improvised.

01:04:35.138 --> 01:04:37.405
- Always with the
Gould thing with you.

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:39.107
I'm not gonna tell it again.

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:41.109
- One point less. I mean...

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:44.379
A life can change based
on the split-second whim

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:47.182
of a judge who's
probably deaf anyway.

01:04:47.184 --> 01:04:48.734
One point less.

01:04:48.735 --> 01:04:50.285
- I should never have
told you that, you nut.

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:52.554
- My dear, you might
not even be here,

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:53.989
sitting with me,

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.423
if your Dad had the extra point.

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:00.161
Sorry, I'll zip it.

01:05:04.601 --> 01:05:06.568
But I would like you
to try it with me.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.970
Music isn't made of stone.

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.441
Unlike me, it's not always hard.

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:15.210
- Okay already.

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:17.913
(car screetches)

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:19.214
(chuckling)

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:20.982
(car backfires)

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:24.119
- Oh, jeez! What the hell
is this guy's problem?

01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:25.487
- I was going to tell you.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.089
- What?

01:05:29.059 --> 01:05:31.493
- He's from New York.

01:05:33.196 --> 01:05:35.330
Don't let his muscles,
intimidate you.

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:40.068
- What the hell?

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.297
(sexual moaning)

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:10.532
- Jesus.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:21.409
(sexual screaming)

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:26.014
- Uhh,

01:06:26.016 --> 01:06:27.632
uhh,

01:06:27.633 --> 01:06:29.249
oh that feels so good, baby.

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:30.652
But you know what
sweetie really wants?

01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:33.254
Some fucking rest.

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:34.656
Some fucking rest!

01:06:37.394 --> 01:06:39.494
Note: Director called,
Congratulations

01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:41.563
You got the part!

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:50.772
(piano music)

01:06:58.215 --> 01:06:59.447
I can do both.

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.157
You can do it.

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:12.293
It's no big deal.

01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:15.296
Just tell him.

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:18.333
Tell him.

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:23.238
- Associated but with
a distinctive yet
contrasting theme.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:26.408
So usually the
two tonal areas...

01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:34.382
- Hello, I was
coming to find you.

01:07:34.384 --> 01:07:37.285
I have a tremendous
surprise for you.

01:07:37.287 --> 01:07:38.486
- Hi, I-- I do too...

01:07:38.488 --> 01:07:42.090
- [Lawrence] We are
unbelievably lucky.

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:43.091
- I-- I have a um--

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:46.594
- Well, you have to
wait to hear this first.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.948
It'll be more work, sure,

01:07:49.949 --> 01:07:52.333
a lot more work, actually,
but we can handle it.

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:55.503
- Actually Dad I'm working
pretty hard already and...

01:07:55.505 --> 01:07:58.339
- Yes yes yes, but wait
until you hear this.

01:07:58.341 --> 01:08:00.442
Though you have a year left,

01:08:00.444 --> 01:08:04.546
Columbia Artists has decided
to book the world tour with us.

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.682
Our dreams come true.

01:08:08.452 --> 01:08:11.219
These are our contracts.

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:14.322
We are going to tour together.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:16.624
I love you, isn't this amazing?

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:18.526
This is only the beginning.

01:08:18.528 --> 01:08:19.810
- Dad.

01:08:19.812 --> 01:08:21.095
- Aren't you happy, hmm?

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:23.765
- No.

01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:26.134
No.

01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:28.670
Let go.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.305
Let go.

01:08:30.307 --> 01:08:32.240
No, no.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:35.443
Let go, Dad.

01:08:39.182 --> 01:08:40.314
- Jaqueline?

01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:42.250
Jaqueline!

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.334
- Yes, since this morning.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:35.170
- [Woman On Phone]
You called before?

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.438
- Yes, I called before.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.189
- [Woman On Phone] All right.

01:09:39.191 --> 01:09:40.941
Ma'am, let's just try
and take a deep breath.

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:43.678
- When he's upset, he leaves.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.913
He just drives and drives.

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:48.349
- [Woman On Phone]
Well, we are going to do

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.334
everything we can.

01:09:49.335 --> 01:09:50.318
- Oh my, I've gotta go.

01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:58.893
- He's gonna be okay ma'am.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:02.764
We found him in a ditch.

01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:03.765
He had this.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.913
- She's not here?

01:10:53.817 --> 01:10:54.849
- No, dear.

01:10:57.254 --> 01:11:00.421
(audience applauding)

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:31.753
(audience chuckles)

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:39.694
- I don't see where she is,

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:42.297
but my daughter always
loved this piece,

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:46.801
and it is for her that
I begin my program

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.603
with Liszt's Funerailles.

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:00.732
It's date of composition

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:02.517
is the same of that
of Chopin's death.

01:12:02.519 --> 01:12:07.655
There's suspicion that it
is an homage to Chopin.

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:12.660
(crying)
(Lawrence muffled)

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:20.335
May have affected Liszt
to write one of his

01:12:20.337 --> 01:12:22.870
most majestic pieces
for the piano.

01:12:24.074 --> 01:12:28.543
I hope you enjoy it as much
as my daughter, and my family.

01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:31.813
Thank you.

01:12:47.897 --> 01:12:50.998
(dark piano music)

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:33.408
(high pitched ringing)

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:56.497
(heartbeat pounding)

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:17.518
(crying)

01:14:56.159 --> 01:15:00.127
(audience applauding)

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:43.538
- Pick up, pick up.

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:46.173
- [Jed/New Yorker] Hello?

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:47.174
- Hello?

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:50.578
I'm sorry to call
you out of the blue.

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:52.947
I'm sure your busy, I just.

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:54.549
- [Jed] Jaqueline?

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:55.950
- Yes, it's me.

01:15:55.952 --> 01:15:56.951
- [Jed] Are you okay?

01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:57.952
- I think I,

01:16:00.623 --> 01:16:02.690
I think I'd like to ride
with you to New York.

01:16:02.692 --> 01:16:03.891
- [Jed] Oh.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.326
- Is the offer still good?

01:16:06.563 --> 01:16:08.829
- [Jed] I think the
offer's still good.

01:16:08.831 --> 01:16:10.965
I was gonna leave in a
couple of hours, though.

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:12.333
Could you manage that?

01:16:12.335 --> 01:16:13.334
- Yeah.

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:16.871
Absolutely.

01:16:19.342 --> 01:16:22.610
(soft piano music)

01:16:58.881 --> 01:16:59.847
No.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:11.058
It can change.

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:23.771
(soft rock music)

01:17:25.642 --> 01:17:27.041
Wheee!

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:44.959
Okay,

01:17:46.763 --> 01:17:48.563
how about this?

01:17:48.564 --> 01:17:50.364
So, some go everywhere together.

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:54.168
They push and pull,
yet they never touch.

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:55.236
They can't.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:59.490
Or they lose their identity,

01:17:59.491 --> 01:18:01.808
the become one note,
not two or more.

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:05.212
I don't...

01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:06.047
You follow?

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:07.348
- No. No.

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:09.083
No, that's your thing.

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:10.952
(laughs)

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:12.820
- [Jaqueline] All
right. You can drive.

01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:28.736
- [Jaqueline Voiceover]
Dearest Matthew,

01:18:28.738 --> 01:18:31.038
you are such a great friend.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.741
I'm sorry I didn't get
to say goodbye in person,

01:18:33.743 --> 01:18:36.210
but I cannot stay in this world.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:39.480
I got a chance to
go to New York.

01:18:40.717 --> 01:18:41.982
I'll never forget you.

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:45.419
I think it's time to...

01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:47.388
improvise.

01:18:51.728 --> 01:18:52.393
Love, Jaqueline.

01:18:56.933 --> 01:18:58.399
- Well, I'll be damned.

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:13.447
- Just where I put
my pain, that's all.

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:14.448
- Gotcha.

01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:20.321
- You might need this.

01:19:20.323 --> 01:19:21.322
- Thanks.

01:19:26.028 --> 01:19:27.294
- How's that hand doing?

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:31.065
- Much better.

01:19:31.067 --> 01:19:32.066
Thank you.

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:35.903
- Piggyback?

01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:37.905
- Sure.

01:19:49.051 --> 01:19:51.786
(piano music)

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:23.484
(flute music)

01:20:48.978 --> 01:20:51.946
- Hey, hey Mister Archer.

01:20:59.388 --> 01:21:01.455
Sorry, I can't chat now.

01:21:07.263 --> 01:21:08.996
- I think it's pretty lucky

01:21:08.998 --> 01:21:11.599
that you got the
time to get away.

01:21:11.601 --> 01:21:13.968
- Yeah, thank you for
letting me come with you

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:15.402
on such short notice.

01:21:16.339 --> 01:21:17.872
- I enjoyed your company.

01:21:22.278 --> 01:21:24.078
You've got friends that know

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:25.879
you're coming into
the city, right?

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:30.284
You didn't ask me
when I'm driving back.

01:21:33.522 --> 01:21:35.656
You're not coming
back with me, are you?

01:21:37.159 --> 01:21:38.158
- No.

01:21:47.103 --> 01:21:50.037
- It's just this
collection of plays.

01:21:51.374 --> 01:21:53.107
You may already have them, but.

01:21:54.043 --> 01:21:55.042
- Thank you.

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:04.184
(train whistle blowing)

01:22:11.193 --> 01:22:14.328
(light piano music)

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:27.408
- Oh!

01:22:33.616 --> 01:22:35.349
I'm sorry, I'm such
a mess. (laughing)

01:22:39.588 --> 01:22:40.587
Uh...

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:42.356
I, um,

01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:48.095
Wow,I...

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:52.967
I should have found
another table.

01:22:52.969 --> 01:22:56.370
- No, it's fine really.

01:22:59.108 --> 01:23:01.041
- Oh, here.

01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:05.646
Have one of these.

01:23:08.451 --> 01:23:09.650
It's an amateur night.

01:23:11.654 --> 01:23:13.320
Well, it's a bar really but,

01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:18.125
sometimes, sometimes
good people play there.

01:23:19.228 --> 01:23:20.361
- You play there?

01:23:21.364 --> 01:23:22.363
- No.

01:23:23.232 --> 01:23:24.698
No, not me but,

01:23:26.202 --> 01:23:27.201
maybe some day.

01:23:28.371 --> 01:23:29.236
- Okay.

01:23:29.238 --> 01:23:30.237
Thanks.

01:23:34.243 --> 01:23:35.709
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:39.646
- No, I don't think so.

01:23:42.018 --> 01:23:43.083
- But you play violin?

01:23:47.156 --> 01:23:48.155
- Well.

01:23:52.628 --> 01:23:54.028
- Oh, I nearly forgot.

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:56.196
My name is Ben.

01:23:58.234 --> 01:23:59.199
- Jaqueline.

01:24:00.569 --> 01:24:01.618
- Pleasure to meet you.

01:24:01.619 --> 01:24:02.668
- Nice to meet you.

01:24:05.174 --> 01:24:09.777
¶ What you can do without ¶

01:24:09.779 --> 01:24:15.115
¶ And don't think
you'll ever learn how ¶

01:24:15.718 --> 01:24:20.187
¶ You turn yourself inside out ¶

01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:25.325
¶ Turn everything else down ¶

01:24:26.128 --> 01:24:29.463
¶ For what you can do without ¶

01:24:29.465 --> 01:24:31.598
¶ Ghosts are in
the walls and all ¶

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:36.737
¶ The voices call
across an empty room ¶

01:24:37.506 --> 01:24:39.740
¶ One is loud above the rest ¶

01:24:39.742 --> 01:24:45.079
¶ Telling you there's
nothing you can do ¶

01:24:46.849 --> 01:24:52.186
¶ But carry on ¶

01:24:52.555 --> 01:24:57.558
¶ Carry on ¶

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:03.363
¶ Don't give up ¶

01:25:05.534 --> 01:25:10.671
¶ For how long ¶

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:15.776
¶ How long ¶

01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:18.612
¶ How long ¶

01:25:27.389 --> 01:25:32.526
¶ Angels have fallen on
the doorways of New York ¶

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:35.762
- Ben?

01:25:35.764 --> 01:25:39.766
¶ In the doorways of New York ¶

01:25:42.271 --> 01:25:43.270
- Ben.

01:25:45.174 --> 01:25:46.673
Do you remember me?

01:25:46.675 --> 01:25:47.808
We met today.

01:25:52.181 --> 01:25:53.147
- Hello.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:56.483
Hello.

01:26:09.565 --> 01:26:11.165
You came to rescue me?

01:26:15.271 --> 01:26:17.304
Play for me.

01:26:17.306 --> 01:26:18.305
That's what you...

01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:24.945
Hello.

01:26:25.948 --> 01:26:27.648
- Hey, where is
your hospitality?

01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:28.782
Can I have some too?

01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:40.460
(Quoting) It's so out
of keeping with you.

01:26:40.462 --> 01:26:43.664
You are so refined, you
have such a soft voice.

01:26:43.666 --> 01:26:45.332
- I am on my way home.

01:26:47.436 --> 01:26:51.705
It'll be daylight by the
time they put the horses in.

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:53.941
- What did you say?

01:26:53.943 --> 01:26:58.312
- You see, I am quite sober now.

01:26:59.615 --> 01:27:03.550
Will be, to the end of my days.

01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:11.425
- Where do you live, Ben?

01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:16.797
I have nowhere to go.

01:27:18.667 --> 01:27:22.736
Could I, could we go home?

01:27:26.375 --> 01:27:29.376
(acoustic guitar)

01:27:36.652 --> 01:27:39.353
- Just down the street.

01:27:39.355 --> 01:27:40.654
- Yes?

01:27:40.656 --> 01:27:43.457
(violin music)

01:27:44.827 --> 01:27:45.826
Okay.

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:49.429
Okay, yeah, uh huh.

01:27:51.033 --> 01:27:54.668
(Music continues)

01:27:55.571 --> 01:27:59.506
¶ Cause we were listening ¶

01:27:59.508 --> 01:28:02.409
¶ To the wind.¶

01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:05.646
¶ And it sounded ¶

01:28:05.648 --> 01:28:08.915
¶ Like a story ¶

01:28:08.917 --> 01:28:12.586
¶ No beginning ¶

01:28:12.588 --> 01:28:16.990
¶ And no end. ¶

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:21.895
(raining)

01:28:30.906 --> 01:28:34.041
(upbeat jazz music)

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:44.444
¶ If I was a lion ¶

01:29:44.446 --> 01:29:47.647
¶ If I was king ¶

01:29:47.649 --> 01:29:51.518
¶ If I was an eagle ¶

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:56.656
¶ With the wind in my wings ¶

01:29:57.826 --> 01:30:02.963
¶ Here in the dark
I can be anything ¶

01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:09.169
¶ Night's lover is who I am ¶

01:30:28.690 --> 01:30:31.024
(laughing)

01:30:32.561 --> 01:30:33.760
- I'm stuffed.

01:30:35.697 --> 01:30:37.063
This was wonderful.

01:30:37.065 --> 01:30:41.101
- Dance my hut,
and dance my stove.

01:30:41.103 --> 01:30:43.737
The master has no
bed to sleep on.

01:30:45.441 --> 01:30:48.041
- I just cannot believe
that was your favorite play.

01:30:48.844 --> 01:30:52.579
- My child, how my heart aches.

01:30:52.581 --> 01:30:57.584
Oh, if only you knew
how my heart aches.

01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:04.124
All right, it's your
turn to pick the music.

01:31:04.126 --> 01:31:06.726
Now, for dessert.

01:31:06.728 --> 01:31:09.162
- Oh my God Ben, no.

01:31:09.164 --> 01:31:10.163
I'm stuffed.

01:31:10.165 --> 01:31:13.200
- [Ben] Well, you'd better
find some room somewhere,

01:31:13.202 --> 01:31:15.168
because dessert is on its way.

01:32:47.129 --> 01:32:48.795
What are you gonna play?

01:32:59.107 --> 01:33:01.975
- I think I'm
going to improvise.

01:33:18.894 --> 01:33:23.163
Well, I think that's all
I can play right now.

01:33:43.719 --> 01:33:44.918
This is my father.

01:33:49.758 --> 01:33:50.757
Come.

01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:05.171
(classical music)

01:34:10.879 --> 01:34:12.412
What do you think?

01:34:24.059 --> 01:34:25.325
We shall rest.

01:34:29.831 --> 01:34:31.197
We shall rest.

01:34:34.836 --> 01:34:36.903
We shall hear the angels.

01:34:37.939 --> 01:34:41.207
We shall see all heaven
lit with radiance.

01:34:42.411 --> 01:34:45.945
We shall see all Earthly
evil, all our sufferings,

01:34:47.215 --> 01:34:50.150
drowned in the mercy which
will fill the whole world.

01:35:07.335 --> 01:35:10.103
And our life will be peaceful,

01:35:10.105 --> 01:35:13.373
gentle, and sweet as a caress.

01:35:13.375 --> 01:35:16.109
(piano music)

01:35:25.153 --> 01:35:30.290
We shall rest.

01:35:34.129 --> 01:35:39.265
We shall rest.

01:35:40.268 --> 01:35:41.735
We shall rest.

01:35:43.739 --> 01:35:47.006
(music begins)

01:35:52.047 --> 01:35:54.013
¶ The old light in
me, tells me that ¶

01:35:54.015 --> 01:35:57.417
¶ Time loves to breathe. ¶

01:35:57.419 --> 01:36:01.054
¶ Water and all ¶

01:36:01.056 --> 01:36:05.024
¶ Everything ¶

01:36:05.026 --> 01:36:10.163
¶ La da da da ¶

01:36:12.868 --> 01:36:18.004
¶ The old light in me ¶

01:36:18.473 --> 01:36:22.142
¶ Gets up through dust ¶

01:36:22.144 --> 01:36:26.946
¶ And dawn to be ¶

01:36:26.948 --> 01:36:30.350
¶ Movin' wind ¶

01:36:30.352 --> 01:36:34.187
¶ Swayin' trees ¶

01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:37.257
La da da da

01:36:44.332 --> 01:36:49.469
¶ You are the dancer ¶

01:36:51.039 --> 01:36:56.176
¶ You're the owner of wings ¶

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:03.950
¶ I don't know the answers ¶

01:37:06.354 --> 01:37:10.390
¶ But I came here to sing ¶

01:37:10.392 --> 01:37:14.327
¶ Of old light ¶

01:37:14.329 --> 01:37:19.465
¶ Old light ¶

01:37:20.035 --> 01:37:23.303
¶ Old light ¶

01:37:23.305 --> 01:37:26.239
¶ Old light ¶

01:37:26.241 --> 01:37:29.976
¶ Old light ¶

01:37:29.978 --> 01:37:33.012
¶ Old light ¶

01:37:33.014 --> 01:37:37.016
¶ Old light ¶

01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:41.888
¶ Old light ¶

01:37:41.890 --> 01:37:47.026
¶ Old light old light ¶

01:37:47.429 --> 01:37:51.164
¶ Oh! Oh! ¶

01:37:51.166 --> 01:37:55.001
¶ Old ¶

01:37:55.003 --> 01:37:58.571
¶ Light Light Light¶

01:38:05.146 --> 01:38:09.148
¶ Oh....¶

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:22.061
¶ Old light ¶
