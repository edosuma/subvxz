WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:03.870
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares...

00:03.937 --> 00:06.907
Chef Ramsay heads
to Carlstadt, New Jersey,

00:06.973 --> 00:10.210
and encounters the most insecure
owner he has ever met.

00:10.277 --> 00:13.046
I don't even know if I can
handle this tonight.

00:13.113 --> 00:15.549
Co-owner Mitch is a broken man.

00:15.615 --> 00:17.284
I don't know if I can
make it through this.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.619
He doesn't have the support
of his fellow partners--

00:19.686 --> 00:21.054
His father-in-law, Chief...

00:21.121 --> 00:22.956
I need that now.
Just get it.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.424
And his wife, Maureen.

00:24.491 --> 00:25.492
Out of the kitchen!

00:25.559 --> 00:26.626
What are you talking about?

00:26.693 --> 00:28.161
I'm getting pissed.
All right?

00:28.228 --> 00:30.000
I don't give a
whether you get pissed or not.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.097
I don't give a
whether you get pissed or not.

00:30.163 --> 00:31.998
Mitch is unable
to control his cooks.

00:32.065 --> 00:34.401
What the
is going on?

00:34.468 --> 00:35.669
And the food they serve...

00:35.736 --> 00:36.670
What is that?

00:36.770 --> 00:38.004
Look how slimy it is.

00:38.105 --> 00:39.973
How can you serve that?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.174
With an incompetent staff...

00:41.241 --> 00:43.310
It's  raw.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.845
A disgusting kitchen...

00:44.911 --> 00:47.114
Where's the standard?

00:47.180 --> 00:49.149
And a family that is
tearing apart...

00:49.216 --> 00:50.384
Shut up!
Why do you tell me
to shut up?

00:50.450 --> 00:51.618
I said shut up!

00:51.685 --> 00:53.253
I'd like to shut the doors
and just say,

00:53.320 --> 00:54.488
"You know what?
forget all."

00:54.554 --> 00:57.257
We are not gonna continue
along these lines.

00:57.324 --> 00:59.259
Just stop!
Stop, hey!

00:59.326 --> 01:00.000
This is the one
Kitchen Nightmares...

01:00.000 --> 01:01.161
This is the one
Kitchen Nightmares...

01:01.261 --> 01:03.163
Mitch! Do something!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.664
Where it could all
come crashing down...

01:04.731 --> 01:07.768
I am not serving food tonight.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.669
Dinner is canceled.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.304
Before it even starts.

01:11.371 --> 01:12.406
I give up.

01:12.472 --> 01:13.907
Close the  door.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.595
Carlstadt, New Jersey.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.697
A small, industrial town

01:37.697 --> 01:40.333
buried in the shadow
of Meadowland Stadium.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.870
Only a mile away sits
the Grasshopper also,

01:43.870 --> 01:46.105
a family-owned Irish pub
and restaurant.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.940
Hi. How are you, gals?

01:47.974 --> 01:50.076
How you doing?
All right? Good.

01:50.143 --> 01:53.780
17 years ago, newlyweds
Mitch and Maureen Sandler

01:53.780 --> 01:55.348
purchased the restaurant
with Maureen's father,

01:55.448 --> 01:57.117
a successful restaurateur

01:57.183 --> 02:00.000
with 40 years of experience
in the business.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.153
with 40 years of experience
in the business.

02:00.220 --> 02:01.821
We were excited,
'cause you have dreams,

02:01.888 --> 02:03.256
and you say,
"Okay, let's go for it."

02:03.323 --> 02:04.457
So that's what we did.

02:04.524 --> 02:05.758
Ready to rock and roll,
right?

02:05.825 --> 02:07.193
Yeah, let's go.
This is gonna be good.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.795
It took off,
and we were booming.

02:08.862 --> 02:09.963
Enjoy your meal.

02:10.029 --> 02:11.731
People were coming in
left and right.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.266
All right, this way, please.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.636
And as the years rolled by...

02:16.703 --> 02:18.404
Things started to change
in the business.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.741
Obviously,
it's dead tonight.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.309
Just go home, okay?

02:23.376 --> 02:25.712
As far as why
the restaurant is failing,

02:25.778 --> 02:26.746
I don't know.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.000
This place is a nightmare
because of Mitch.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.784
This place is a nightmare
because of Mitch.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.189
I have no idea.

02:36.256 --> 02:39.125
His supervision is not
what it should be.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.028
Mitch, you gotta
come out here!

02:42.095 --> 02:43.329
Yeah.

02:43.396 --> 02:45.832
Mitch is responsible
for the kitchen.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.033
What am I doing in here?

02:47.100 --> 02:48.501
He's in this restaurant

02:48.568 --> 02:50.136
a ridiculous
amount of hours.

02:50.203 --> 02:52.739
And a majority of those hours
are not productive.

02:52.805 --> 02:54.507
Hey, uh, where's
the toilet plunger?

02:54.574 --> 02:56.376
Can I get a bar mop, please?

02:56.442 --> 02:57.577
How are you?
Good.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.812
There's daily operations
of the restaurant

02:59.879 --> 03:00.000
that he absolutely should not
be involved in.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.015
that he absolutely should not
be involved in.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.618
Maybe he could commit
more of his time

03:05.685 --> 03:07.820
to oversee stuff
that is, you know,

03:07.921 --> 03:09.022
uh, in the kitchen.

03:09.088 --> 03:10.757
All the other stuff
has to be done

03:10.823 --> 03:12.525
that you're not
taking care of.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.928
You're doing
all that other stuff.

03:14.994 --> 03:16.496
Communication between
Mitchell and his staff

03:16.563 --> 03:18.331
is nonexistent.

03:18.398 --> 03:21.000
Hey, uh, how long
does it take to make rice?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.003
The guys don't probably
think it's a problem.

03:25.838 --> 03:27.340
I'm surprised they didn't
make any rice.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.780
And because of that,
the food at the Grasshopper...

03:33.846 --> 03:34.814
Just looks awful.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.249
They didn't like the--

03:36.316 --> 03:37.317
they didn't say there was
a lot of flavor in it.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.551
It is so dry.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.320
He doesn't like this!

03:40.353 --> 03:41.621
That's perfect,
that steak.

03:41.688 --> 03:42.655
It was rare.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.294
Mitch, you call this soup?

03:48.394 --> 03:50.163
Get rid of this.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.066
My father-in-law
blames me for everything,

03:53.132 --> 03:54.634
so I'm the scapegoat.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.035
There's nobody here.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.938
It's horrible.
We need some people.

03:59.005 --> 04:00.000
If we continue this way,
we're not gonna make it.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.407
If we continue this way,
we're not gonna make it.

04:01.474 --> 04:06.079
I feel like my life
is falling apart.

04:07.347 --> 04:08.948
It's pretty tough.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.784
Every day, I think
about the restaurant.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.620
It's all on my shoulders.

04:13.686 --> 04:16.389
And every day,
it eats at me.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.291
We cannot afford this.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.760
Well, that's why
we need some help.

04:20.827 --> 04:24.163
If Chef Ramsay can't help me,

04:24.230 --> 04:25.999
I don't know where else
to turn.

04:26.065 --> 04:27.834
Ah, this is the last resort.

04:39.812 --> 04:40.813
Hello.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.915
Hi, Chef Ramsay.
I'm Maureen Sandler.

04:42.982 --> 04:44.484
Nice to meet you.
It's good
to see you too.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.586
Okay, this is my dad, Eddie.
They call him Chief.

04:46.653 --> 04:48.187
Chef Ramsay, welcome.

04:49.489 --> 04:50.990
Oh, no, no.
This is my husband Mitch.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.058
Hi, Chef, how are you?
Mitch.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.192
We're co-owners.

04:53.259 --> 04:54.193
So the three of you

04:54.260 --> 04:55.228
are running the business
together?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.596
Correct.
Wow.

04:56.663 --> 04:58.298
I should really stand
between these two guys,

04:58.364 --> 04:59.766
'cause that's usually
the case.

04:59.832 --> 05:00.000
Oh, really?
Why do you say that?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.167
Oh, really?
Why do you say that?

05:01.234 --> 05:02.468
We butt heads
occasionally.

05:02.568 --> 05:03.636
Occasionally?

05:03.703 --> 05:04.771
Are you kidding?

05:04.837 --> 05:06.706
We almost kill each other.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.007
Yes.
Yeah, okay.
Right.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.609
Wow, you're already
refereeing these two.

05:09.676 --> 05:10.677
I mean, who does what?

05:10.743 --> 05:13.646
I'm the one that
oversees the kitchen.

05:13.713 --> 05:15.448
Okay, so I'd like
to get up to speed

05:15.515 --> 05:18.351
with you individually,
and have a quick chat.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.053
Come on this way.

05:20.119 --> 05:22.055
I'm the one that
takes care of the bills,

05:22.121 --> 05:23.890
And it's getting
tougher and tougher.

05:23.956 --> 05:27.493
So we need
Chef Ramsay's help.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.395
The fact that you stood in
the middle of those two guys--

05:29.462 --> 05:30.000
is it really that bad, or...

05:30.000 --> 05:30.863
is it really that bad, or...

05:30.930 --> 05:34.300
Business has
changed drastically.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.369
And my father
has to blame somebody,

05:36.436 --> 05:37.537
and he blames my husband.

05:37.603 --> 05:39.505
Where does
your allegiance lie?

05:39.572 --> 05:40.773
With my husband.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.842
You know, I support him.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.010
How much did it cost
to build this?

05:46.112 --> 05:47.246
That's crazy.

05:47.313 --> 05:49.449
What do you think
is wrong with the business?

05:49.515 --> 05:52.485
Mitch is one
of the biggest problems.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.754
Do you regret now,

05:54.821 --> 05:56.122
16 years later,

05:56.189 --> 05:57.190
giving him part
of the business?

05:57.256 --> 05:58.791
Yes, I do.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.000
Tell me...

06:00.000 --> 06:00.493
Tell me...

06:00.560 --> 06:03.529
the biggest issue
inside Grasshopper.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.865
My father-in-law
blames me for everything.

06:05.932 --> 06:08.334
But is he right
or is he wrong?

06:08.401 --> 06:09.836
Could be right.

06:09.902 --> 06:10.903
Could be wrong.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.540
Who's running it?
I guess I am, right?

06:15.808 --> 06:16.976
Let's talk about
the food.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.078
Uh, people seem to like it.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.346
Lovely, I can't wait
to taste that.

06:20.413 --> 06:21.614
Enjoy.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.549
Our traditional
Irish food's good here.

06:23.616 --> 06:25.084
I think he'll like the food.
I hope.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.487
Hello.

06:27.553 --> 06:28.621
Hi, how are you?

06:28.688 --> 06:29.756
Good.
And first name is...

06:29.822 --> 06:30.000
Chef Ramsay.
Annette.
Annette.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.090
Chef Ramsay.
Annette.
Annette.

06:31.157 --> 06:32.358
Nice to see you,
darling.
Very nice to meet you.

06:32.425 --> 06:33.593
And you are...

06:33.659 --> 06:35.528
The floor manager here.
Floor manager.

06:35.595 --> 06:36.929
How long have you been here?

06:36.996 --> 06:38.364
I've worked in this one
for 16 years.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.365
You've been here
from day one.

06:39.465 --> 06:40.466
Day one.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.802
What's wrong
with the restaurant?

06:42.869 --> 06:46.239
Um...starts at the top.

06:46.305 --> 06:47.273
Management...or lack of.

06:47.340 --> 06:48.441
Very frustrating.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.876
Well, I love your honesty.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.344
On a scale of one to ten,

06:51.411 --> 06:52.845
what would you rate the food?

06:52.912 --> 06:55.181
Mm...

06:55.248 --> 06:57.617
A three.

06:57.683 --> 06:59.218
The cooks are winging it.

07:01.487 --> 07:04.157
I don't think care goes into
every dish that they're making.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.861
Okay, have you decided?

07:08.928 --> 07:10.763
Let's go for
the French onion soup.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.532
Okay.
Shepherd's pie.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.167
And I'll go for
the fisherman's platter.

07:14.233 --> 07:15.501
Fantastic.
Hungry, hey?

07:15.568 --> 07:16.769
Oh, yes.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.771
Dying to get my head around
what's going on.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.606
All right, what's he having?

07:20.673 --> 07:22.074
First thing's first.

07:22.141 --> 07:24.143
He'd like
a French onion soup.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.179
Thank you.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.647
How bloody awful.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.282
Lamps from another era.

07:30.383 --> 07:31.717
Those bouquets,

07:31.784 --> 07:33.119
they look like
my grandmother's luggage.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.353
Unbelievable.

07:36.722 --> 07:39.192
This soup,
it takes like tar.

07:39.258 --> 07:41.394
I think it's pretty good.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.097
Yes. Okay.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.866
Mitch is serving the food,

07:46.933 --> 07:49.168
which I told him,
completely wrong.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.770
But unfortunately,
he doesn't know

07:50.837 --> 07:52.238
what he's doing in here.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.473
Okay, enjoy.

07:53.539 --> 07:54.507
Thank you.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.843
Dreadful color.

07:56.909 --> 08:00.000
Eesh.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.913
Eesh.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.515
Ahh..

08:02.582 --> 08:04.317
Tastes like somebody's
dropped sliced onions

08:04.383 --> 08:06.018
into boiling dishwater.

08:06.085 --> 08:07.620
Dreadful.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.088
How's the French onion?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.457
You're off to a bad start,
unfortunately.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.860
It's like someone's
in my soup.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.194
Well, that's not good.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.596
We'll take this away.
All right.

08:17.763 --> 08:18.698
That was dreadful.

08:18.764 --> 08:21.033
All right, um, guys,

08:21.100 --> 08:25.171
the French onion,
he said it's like.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.073
Flavor, he said,
was not good.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.179
We know, I know.

08:37.783 --> 08:39.185
I don't know.
I'll find out.

08:39.252 --> 08:42.054
The kitchen staff will do
what they want to do.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.023
And do as little
as possible.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.125
Mitch should grab the bull
by the horns

08:46.192 --> 08:47.827
and be in command.

08:47.894 --> 08:49.729
All right, shepherd's pie.
Here we go.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.664
Thank you, Gabriel.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.032
He makes a good
shepherd's pie.

08:54.433 --> 08:55.401
All right, Chef.

08:55.468 --> 08:56.869
Thank you.
Shepherd's pie.

08:56.969 --> 08:59.572
Wow, that's a very
bizarre-looking shepherd's pie.

08:59.639 --> 09:00.000
Did someone put gravy on top
of my crispy mash?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.841
Did someone put gravy on top
of my crispy mash?

09:01.908 --> 09:02.742
Yes.

09:02.808 --> 09:04.577
That is a shocker.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.213
Like someone's snot
all over my mash.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.781
And that gravy
is made from...

09:08.848 --> 09:09.815
Beef.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.718
Beef stock
on a shepherd's pie?

09:12.785 --> 09:13.920
Yes.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.154
And shepherd's pie
is made out of...

09:15.221 --> 09:16.355
This one is actually beef.

09:16.422 --> 09:17.790
So it's a cottage pie.

09:17.857 --> 09:18.925
Not a shepherd's pie.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.394
'Cause shepherd stands
for the...

09:21.460 --> 09:22.395
The sheep.

09:22.461 --> 09:23.462
The sheep.

09:23.529 --> 09:24.664
I'll be back
to check on you.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.532
Eesh.

09:30.369 --> 09:31.771
Cold, congealed gravy.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.673
Just like...glue.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.409
So how are we doing?

09:36.475 --> 09:38.744
Taste that for me.

09:38.811 --> 09:40.379
Ouch.
Yeah.

09:40.446 --> 09:41.914
Just gross.
And it's not hot either.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.649
That's partly the reason
why they're not coming back.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.586
It's just watery...Damn.

09:46.652 --> 09:48.187
That was two strikes right away.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.690
And I was fairly confident
that he would like one of them,

09:50.756 --> 09:51.757
at least.

09:51.824 --> 09:52.758
You all right?

09:52.825 --> 09:54.927
Fine. I'm good.

09:54.994 --> 09:56.429
Damn.

09:56.495 --> 09:57.630
There's a, uh,

09:57.697 --> 09:59.198
there's a lot of pain
on Mitch's face.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.000
We're batting zero.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.933
We're batting zero.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.005
Yeah, with a big, uh...
Whiff.

10:09.842 --> 10:10.943
All right, Chef.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.545
This is our broad
fisherman's platter.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.680
Okay.
Founder, scallops,
and shrimp.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.349
Thank you.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.057
My God.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.058
Oh, boy.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.259
That is gross.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.128
Not good, Chef?

10:29.195 --> 10:30.000
Soft, bland, rubbery.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.264
Soft, bland, rubbery.

10:32.331 --> 10:33.432
I didn't realize
it could be this bad.

10:33.499 --> 10:36.202
Thank you.
Okay.

10:45.277 --> 10:46.679
Oh, no, this was not good.

10:46.746 --> 10:47.980
This is--
we saved the worst...

10:48.047 --> 10:50.449
This is the worst
of the worst.
Till the end.

10:50.516 --> 10:51.851
You know,
you're here 16 years,

10:51.917 --> 10:54.086
so you think your food
is decent.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.422
To hear otherwise
is kind of shocking.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.858
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it through this.

11:00.626 --> 11:01.661
Coming up...

11:01.727 --> 11:02.928
Where's the fridge?

11:02.995 --> 11:04.230
A shocking inspection.

11:04.296 --> 11:06.032
Look how slimy it is.

11:06.098 --> 11:08.067
That's what you cooked
my scallops from?

11:08.134 --> 11:10.069
It's like it's been
attacked my cats.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.071
A gruesome discovery.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.606
How can you serve that?

11:15.306 --> 11:16.441
And a Kitchen Nightmares
first...

11:16.508 --> 11:18.009
We're screwed!

11:18.076 --> 11:19.944
That has Gordon
running for the door.

11:20.011 --> 11:22.280
I am not serving
that  in there.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.281
No way!

11:23.381 --> 11:25.116
Dinner is canceled.

11:35.123 --> 11:36.825
I didn't realize
it could be this bad.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.594
Thoroughly disgusted
with lunch...

11:38.594 --> 11:40.463
That's gross.

11:40.529 --> 11:41.764
Chef Ramsay wants
to meet the chefs

11:41.831 --> 11:45.868
Responsible for this supposed
authentic Irish cuisine.

11:45.935 --> 11:48.037
Come around this side,
please.

11:48.104 --> 11:49.171
So who's the chef?

11:49.238 --> 11:51.040
Mario.

11:51.107 --> 11:52.041
How long have you
been here, sir?

11:52.108 --> 11:55.511
I would say from 1997.

11:55.578 --> 11:57.613
Did you taste any
of the food that came back?

11:57.680 --> 11:58.581
Yes, I did.
You did.

11:58.647 --> 11:59.749
What was your thoughts?

12:01.117 --> 12:03.052
You thought it was okay?

12:03.119 --> 12:05.121
Obviously,
'cause you're smiling.

12:05.187 --> 12:07.556
I'm embarrassed.
You're from Ireland.

12:07.623 --> 12:08.891
Yes.
What I had there today

12:08.958 --> 12:11.093
had nothing to do
with Ireland.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.561
Shepherd's pie...

12:12.628 --> 12:14.864
Well, , I mean,
that wasn't shepherd's pie.

12:14.930 --> 12:16.065
If you went to Dublin

12:16.132 --> 12:17.433
and you served
shepherd's pie like that,

12:17.533 --> 12:18.968
they would shoot you.

12:19.034 --> 12:20.836
The food is embarrassing.

12:22.571 --> 12:25.174
Bland.
Cooked dreadfully.

12:25.274 --> 12:27.109
It has no flavor.

12:27.176 --> 12:29.445
Where's the pot
of scallops?

12:29.512 --> 12:30.479
Where do you keep those?

12:30.546 --> 12:30.557
Right there.

12:30.557 --> 12:31.480
Right there.

12:31.547 --> 12:33.682
Show it to me, please.

12:33.749 --> 12:35.584
Is that what you used
out of mine?

12:35.651 --> 12:39.388
So...that's what you cooked
my scallops from, yeah?

12:45.227 --> 12:46.328
Are they frozen?

12:47.930 --> 12:49.598
They were frozen but
they're not frozen now.

12:49.665 --> 12:50.733
Yep.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.802
You've got no chance
at cooking that decent.

12:52.868 --> 12:55.604
Oh, my gosh.

12:55.671 --> 12:57.006
I was dying.
I was mortified.

12:57.072 --> 12:59.542
It's not hidden.
It wasn't a secret.

12:59.608 --> 13:00.557
You just have to go in
and open a fridge door.

13:00.557 --> 13:01.310
You just have to go in
and open a fridge door.

13:01.377 --> 13:03.879
What's that in there?

13:03.879 --> 13:06.348
I don't think anybody
walked into the refrigerators

13:06.415 --> 13:08.484
or the walk-in box
to inspect it at all.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.252
Frozen.
Everything's frozen.

13:10.319 --> 13:12.721
That's what he's getting.
Nothing's fresh.

13:14.523 --> 13:15.691
Hold on, hold on a minute.

13:15.758 --> 13:16.792
Maureen, come over.

13:16.859 --> 13:19.862
Mitch, come over, please.

13:19.928 --> 13:21.363
What is that?

13:23.098 --> 13:24.166
How old are they?

13:26.602 --> 13:28.103
That's two days old?

13:28.170 --> 13:30.339
That's a funny two days.

13:30.406 --> 13:30.557
How are you gonna
recook that?

13:30.557 --> 13:33.409
How are you gonna
recook that?

13:33.475 --> 13:35.644
Help me.
What are we gonna do?

13:35.711 --> 13:36.678
You refry it?
Yeah.

13:36.745 --> 13:38.881
So it's fried twice?

13:38.947 --> 13:40.949
I want to throw up.

13:41.016 --> 13:42.584
There's not enough
liquor in that bar

13:42.651 --> 13:46.422
to get them inebriated enough
to even attempt to eat that.

13:46.488 --> 13:48.257
Is there any control
in here, guys?

13:48.323 --> 13:49.658
Ugh.
What is that?

13:50.793 --> 13:51.827
Can you see that there?

13:51.894 --> 13:53.762
Blood.
Blood from where?

13:54.997 --> 13:56.398
Blood from the meat

13:56.465 --> 13:58.400
on the mozzarella sticks.

13:59.968 --> 14:00.557
Come on, guys.

14:00.557 --> 14:01.437
Come on, guys.

14:01.503 --> 14:03.439
Thank God I didn't have
the  mozzarella sticks.

14:03.505 --> 14:07.142
There's like a blood transfusion
going on down there.

14:07.209 --> 14:08.911
Mitch, when was the last time
you went through the fridge?

14:08.977 --> 14:11.079
Uh...

14:11.213 --> 14:12.881
Talk to me, please.

14:12.948 --> 14:16.552
I have not gone
through this fridge, Chef.

14:16.618 --> 14:18.987
I left it up to my staff.

14:19.054 --> 14:20.823
I knew I had
a problem with Mitch

14:20.889 --> 14:22.458
as far as that supervision
was involved.

14:22.524 --> 14:24.793
But I didn't think
it was this bad, you know?

14:24.860 --> 14:26.261
You've got raw meat here.

14:26.328 --> 14:28.096
Cooked meat.

14:28.163 --> 14:29.832
Salami.
Blood in there.

14:29.898 --> 14:30.557
Come on, please.

14:30.557 --> 14:31.533
Come on, please.

14:31.600 --> 14:32.935
Don't do this
to yourself,

14:33.035 --> 14:36.972
let alone the customers.

14:37.039 --> 14:38.474
Rule number one

14:38.540 --> 14:40.075
when learning to cook,

14:40.142 --> 14:42.411
you cannot store raw meat

14:42.478 --> 14:43.812
and cooked meat

14:43.879 --> 14:45.614
on the same  shelf

14:45.681 --> 14:48.484
in the same  fridge!

14:48.550 --> 14:50.552
The whole  thing

14:50.619 --> 14:52.955
has got
a cross-contamination.

14:55.157 --> 14:56.325
Chief, give me something.

14:56.391 --> 14:58.026
There's a lack
of supervision in here.

14:58.093 --> 14:59.561
Where's the rest
of the fridge?

14:59.628 --> 15:00.557
This way.

15:00.557 --> 15:00.629
This way.

15:00.696 --> 15:02.130
That's what
I need to see.

15:08.070 --> 15:10.138
What's in there?

15:10.205 --> 15:11.139
Chicken tenders?

15:11.206 --> 15:13.375
Why is it all bubbly
and slimy?

15:14.576 --> 15:15.978
The chicken
comes like that?

15:17.212 --> 15:18.547
Look how slimy it is.

15:18.614 --> 15:20.916
Look how slimy it is.

15:20.983 --> 15:22.551
Look at it.

15:26.255 --> 15:27.923
My God.
That's horrific.

15:27.990 --> 15:29.491
It's totally embarrassing.

15:29.558 --> 15:30.557
What is this?

15:30.557 --> 15:31.159
What is this?

15:32.561 --> 15:35.831
How can you serve that?

15:35.898 --> 15:38.467
It's like it's been
left out for days and...

15:38.534 --> 15:40.035
It's been attacked by cats.

15:42.905 --> 15:44.640
This is where
your money's going.

15:44.706 --> 15:46.308
Irrespective of where the
customers aren't coming from,

15:46.375 --> 15:48.076
but just from the base...

15:48.143 --> 15:49.378
Damn sweet waste.

15:49.444 --> 15:51.246
I know,
'cause I pay the bills.

15:51.313 --> 15:52.281
Let me just tell you now,

15:52.347 --> 15:53.482
I would never,

15:53.549 --> 15:55.784
never have put

15:55.851 --> 15:56.919
a spoon of anything
in my mouth

15:56.985 --> 15:59.888
if I knew this
was taking place.

16:01.823 --> 16:04.860
Shocking to see

16:04.927 --> 16:07.930
just the extent
of cross contamination.

16:07.996 --> 16:09.231
There's no one checking it.

16:09.298 --> 16:10.933
Sorry, Chief.

16:10.999 --> 16:12.367
You may be the chief,

16:12.434 --> 16:14.036
but I swear to God
there's one thing

16:14.102 --> 16:15.504
that Grasshopper
hasn't got

16:15.571 --> 16:17.639
is a leader!

16:17.706 --> 16:19.074
We should all be
ashamed of ourselves.

16:19.141 --> 16:20.676
At this point in time,
I'd like to shut the doors

16:20.742 --> 16:22.244
and just say, "You know what?
forget all."

16:22.311 --> 16:24.179
Someone's got to help me
here a little bit.

16:24.246 --> 16:27.082
I cannot help a situation

16:27.149 --> 16:29.184
who are not willing
to help themselves.

16:29.251 --> 16:30.557
And you don't need me
to come in here

16:30.557 --> 16:31.086
And you don't need me
to come in here

16:31.153 --> 16:32.988
and turn your fridge
upside down.

16:33.055 --> 16:34.156
Mitch...

16:34.222 --> 16:35.591
if you're the one

16:35.657 --> 16:37.626
with the hands-on role
in this business,

16:37.693 --> 16:38.961
and you're supporting him,

16:39.027 --> 16:41.430
and you're the su--
the mentoring figure,

16:41.496 --> 16:42.531
we're screwed!

16:44.132 --> 16:45.567
We have people
coming tonight.

16:45.634 --> 16:46.635
What are we--
what are we gonna do?

16:46.702 --> 16:48.136
I can guarantee you
one thing,

16:48.203 --> 16:51.940
I am not
serving food tonight...

16:52.007 --> 16:53.709
with that  in there.

16:55.477 --> 16:56.411
No way!

17:03.285 --> 17:04.887
What is that in there?

17:04.953 --> 17:07.056
After a horrifying
inspection in the kitchen...

17:07.122 --> 17:10.292
The whole thing has got
a cross-contamination.

17:10.359 --> 17:12.361
Chef Ramsay was left
with no choice.

17:12.428 --> 17:16.765
I am not serving
that  in there.

17:16.832 --> 17:17.766
No way!

17:20.302 --> 17:23.272
I'm beyond--beyond embarrassed
about this situation.

17:23.338 --> 17:25.374
Shutting down our dinner
service, it's a nightmare.

17:25.441 --> 17:27.443
We cannot afford this.

17:27.509 --> 17:28.811
And okay, you want to open.

17:28.877 --> 17:30.546
Fine, of course I want
business in here.

17:30.646 --> 17:31.721
But open with what?

17:31.721 --> 17:32.314
But open with what?

17:32.381 --> 17:34.550
Take one good look
at yourselves

17:34.616 --> 17:36.218
and  think.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.222
I need some air, guys.

17:41.290 --> 17:43.492
Air and a stomach pump.

17:43.559 --> 17:47.296
We have never closed
for dinner, ever.

17:47.362 --> 17:48.864
I mean, we've had 18 inches
of snow outside,

17:48.964 --> 17:50.866
and we've opened.

17:50.933 --> 17:52.134
Mitch...

17:52.201 --> 17:53.602
there has to be leadership
in the kitchen.

17:53.669 --> 17:55.237
What are you gonna
do tonight?

17:59.708 --> 18:00.809
Guess what
they're throwing out.

18:00.876 --> 18:01.721
They're throwing dollars out.

18:01.721 --> 18:01.877
They're throwing dollars out.

18:01.944 --> 18:03.445
And guess
who's paying for it.

18:03.545 --> 18:04.646
We are.

18:04.713 --> 18:06.181
We're paying for it.

18:06.248 --> 18:08.117
What just happened
here tonight

18:08.183 --> 18:09.952
was, um,
kind of a disaster.

18:10.018 --> 18:14.056
Mitch knows that this whole
thing right now, tonight,

18:14.123 --> 18:15.390
is his responsibility.

18:15.457 --> 18:18.327
We can't serve any food
the way it is.

18:18.393 --> 18:20.829
The dinner is canceled.

18:20.896 --> 18:23.365
I'm shocked.
I'm drained, emotionally.

18:23.432 --> 18:26.168
I hope this does not happen
ever again.

18:26.235 --> 18:27.736
Otherwise, we won't be here.

18:27.803 --> 18:28.804
Mitch...

18:33.842 --> 18:34.943
When I said, okay--

18:35.010 --> 18:36.345
What are you starting
to fight with me now?

18:36.445 --> 18:38.847
I'm not, I'm just
saying, Mitch, I'm just--

18:38.914 --> 18:40.115
That's where my focus is.

18:42.551 --> 18:44.019
Bad news, folks.

18:44.086 --> 18:45.821
Sorry, we're
not open tonight.

18:45.888 --> 18:47.623
There wasn't enough
supervision in there.

18:47.689 --> 18:50.259
And I guess the
has hit the fan today.

18:50.359 --> 18:51.293
I'm sorry about it.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.795
Aww.
Sorry about that.

18:52.861 --> 18:54.630
Definitely I'm embarrassed.

18:54.696 --> 18:56.331
As Chief returns
from telling customers

18:56.398 --> 18:57.766
the restaurant is closed,

18:57.833 --> 19:00.903
inside, a leader has emerged

19:00.969 --> 19:01.721
to supervise
the cleaning of the kitchen.

19:01.721 --> 19:02.571
to supervise
the cleaning of the kitchen.

19:02.638 --> 19:04.173
Mitch, all of this
has to be thrown out.

19:04.239 --> 19:05.607
But it's not Mitch.

19:05.674 --> 19:07.709
Because the blood
was coming down.

19:07.776 --> 19:09.011
Throw it out.
Get rid of it.

19:09.077 --> 19:10.045
It's Maureen.

19:10.112 --> 19:11.280
All right?
That has to go.

19:11.346 --> 19:12.481
It's very upsetting.

19:12.548 --> 19:14.449
The food that's going
into that garbage

19:14.516 --> 19:15.617
is our profits.

19:15.684 --> 19:17.119
Throw out.
Gone.

19:17.186 --> 19:18.387
And here we are
in a situation

19:18.453 --> 19:19.555
where we're not
making profits.

19:21.490 --> 19:22.858
Mitch, this has to be
thrown out.

19:22.925 --> 19:24.560
This has to go.
All right, Maureen.

19:24.626 --> 19:25.928
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

19:25.994 --> 19:28.163
Everything was thrown away.

19:28.230 --> 19:29.298
Disposed of.

19:29.398 --> 19:30.632
Scrubbed, washed.

19:30.699 --> 19:31.721
Cleaned.

19:31.721 --> 19:31.934
Cleaned.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.436
And, uh, we'll start again.

19:34.503 --> 19:36.205
We're cleaning.
We're closed.

19:36.271 --> 19:38.340
Everything's gotta be clean.

19:43.579 --> 19:45.113
After an eye-opening
first day,

19:45.180 --> 19:48.851
Chef Ramsay realizes that
it's not just the restaurant

19:48.917 --> 19:50.385
that is on the line,

19:50.452 --> 19:52.988
but Mitch and Maureen's
marriage as well.

19:53.055 --> 19:54.323
Morning.
Hi, Chef.

19:54.389 --> 19:55.324
How are you?
Good.
How are you doing?

19:55.390 --> 19:56.859
Good.
It's a tough day
yesterday.

19:56.925 --> 19:58.060
Yeah, I'll say.

19:58.126 --> 19:59.695
Well, this is my home.

19:59.761 --> 20:00.796
God, who's that?

20:00.863 --> 20:01.721
That's Mitch.

20:01.721 --> 20:01.864
That's Mitch.

20:01.930 --> 20:03.498
Seriously?
Seriously?

20:03.565 --> 20:04.733
When was that taken?

20:04.800 --> 20:06.435
13 years ago.
Wow.

20:06.501 --> 20:08.270
Mitch and I,
back in the day,

20:08.337 --> 20:10.172
were best of friends.

20:10.239 --> 20:11.740
And through the years now,

20:11.807 --> 20:13.375
he's not the same person
he used to be.

20:13.442 --> 20:15.777
And that's the hard thing.

20:15.878 --> 20:17.312
When you opened
that restaurant,

20:17.412 --> 20:18.680
you got married
at the same time.

20:18.747 --> 20:20.482
Right.
The guy
I'm seeing today...

20:20.549 --> 20:21.483
You saw that picture.

20:21.550 --> 20:22.551
That's not the same person.

20:22.618 --> 20:23.986
You haven't got
your breathing space.

20:24.086 --> 20:25.387
Mitch has been suffocated.

20:25.487 --> 20:26.889
And, more importantly,

20:26.955 --> 20:29.424
a man's getting destroyed
on a daily basis.

20:29.491 --> 20:31.721
I...complain to my father.

20:31.721 --> 20:31.827
I...complain to my father.

20:31.894 --> 20:33.495
When he does, like,
the busting chops,

20:33.562 --> 20:35.197
and, like,
breaking him down,

20:35.264 --> 20:36.365
I'm like,
"How dare you?"

20:36.431 --> 20:38.233
So there's me
in the between.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.202
You know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah--
it's fragmented to

20:40.269 --> 20:42.971
where there's nothing
constructive taking place.

20:43.038 --> 20:44.873
But, in Mitch,

20:44.940 --> 20:46.775
I think there's
a broken man there.

20:46.842 --> 20:48.844
He's spent.

20:48.911 --> 20:50.345
He works his ass off.

20:50.412 --> 20:51.914
And what does he get?
And what's his payoff?

20:54.383 --> 20:56.084
16 years in that business.

20:57.986 --> 20:59.721
And it's not right that
we're in this situation.

20:59.788 --> 21:01.223
And it's our doing.

21:01.290 --> 21:01.721
But we have to make
a decision

21:01.721 --> 21:02.424
But we have to make
a decision

21:02.524 --> 21:03.992
on which way to go.

21:04.059 --> 21:05.527
The turnaround's
gonna start today.

21:07.796 --> 21:09.998
We need to start
getting Mitch back.

21:10.065 --> 21:11.066
Okay.

21:11.133 --> 21:12.567
And help him

21:12.634 --> 21:14.569
ascertain
some form of pride

21:14.670 --> 21:16.004
back in his work.

21:16.071 --> 21:18.340
Honestly, the turnaround
will be huge.

21:18.407 --> 21:19.775
But I can't do that
without you.

21:19.841 --> 21:21.209
I'm ready, man.

21:21.276 --> 21:22.945
As far as the business
is concerned

21:23.011 --> 21:24.546
and what is at stake,

21:24.613 --> 21:25.681
it's our family life.

21:25.747 --> 21:27.249
I'll see you back
at the restaurant.

21:27.316 --> 21:28.317
At the end of the day,

21:28.383 --> 21:29.451
This place can't control us.

21:29.518 --> 21:30.419
It's time for us
to control it.

21:30.485 --> 21:31.721
So whatever it takes.

21:31.721 --> 21:32.521
So whatever it takes.

21:32.587 --> 21:35.457
Now convinced that Maureen
will give Mitch the support

21:35.524 --> 21:37.059
He desperately needs,

21:37.126 --> 21:39.795
Chef Ramsay heads back
to the Grasshopper

21:39.862 --> 21:41.430
to see if the restaurant
is clean enough

21:41.497 --> 21:42.664
to open for dinner.

21:42.731 --> 21:44.433
Can I just have a--
have a look?

21:44.500 --> 21:45.968
I hope Chef Ramsay
will, uh,

21:46.034 --> 21:47.202
see a big change in the way

21:47.269 --> 21:48.837
we're running
this kitchen today.

21:48.904 --> 21:51.073
It's better
than yesterday, yeah.

21:51.140 --> 21:52.474
All right, guys, get set up
for service tonight.

21:52.541 --> 21:54.042
I want this set up
completely.

21:54.109 --> 21:55.310
Okay?

21:55.377 --> 21:57.146
You learn from
what went on yesterday,

21:57.212 --> 22:00.649
and--and hope we
get through it okay today.

22:03.252 --> 22:05.053
I don't even know if I can--

22:05.120 --> 22:06.755
how I'm gonna
handle this tonight.

22:06.822 --> 22:08.290
Don't beat yourself up
all the time.

22:08.357 --> 22:10.025
Don't--stop beating
yourself up.

22:10.092 --> 22:11.727
I'm beating myself up,
that's right.

22:13.795 --> 22:16.031
Enough.

22:16.098 --> 22:18.267
Mitch is gung ho.
He'll give it a whirl.

22:18.333 --> 22:21.203
But he has to learn to be
a better communicator.

22:21.270 --> 22:23.038
And, um, work together
as a team,

22:23.105 --> 22:24.473
or else we're not
gonna make it.

22:27.910 --> 22:29.945
While Maureen tried
to energize Mitch,

22:30.012 --> 22:31.721
Chef Ramsay knows that years
of disappointing his wife

22:31.721 --> 22:33.448
Chef Ramsay knows that years
of disappointing his wife

22:33.549 --> 22:34.850
and his father-in-law...

22:34.917 --> 22:36.652
Mitch, you have two seconds?

22:36.718 --> 22:38.387
Take me to the office,
please.

22:38.453 --> 22:40.856
Has resulted in a complete
loss of confidence

22:40.923 --> 22:42.324
for Mitch.

22:42.391 --> 22:43.825
You okay?
Am I okay?

22:43.892 --> 22:44.927
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

22:44.993 --> 22:46.195
Okay, tonight,

22:46.261 --> 22:49.565
I want you to really,
seriously, yeah, make it work.

22:49.631 --> 22:51.266
You have got
to get this right.

22:51.433 --> 22:52.301
Run it.

22:52.367 --> 22:54.002
Let them hear your voice.

22:54.069 --> 22:56.238
You wear your heart
on your sleeve here.

22:56.305 --> 22:57.406
You know that?

22:57.472 --> 22:59.308
I know, I know.
I get emotional.

22:59.374 --> 23:01.410
I can see that.
I can see that.

23:01.476 --> 23:01.721
I can see that,
but relax.

23:01.721 --> 23:03.011
I can see that,
but relax.

23:03.111 --> 23:05.080
You can do this.

23:05.147 --> 23:08.817
The minute you find
that voice...
Yeah?

23:08.884 --> 23:10.352
They'll all back off.
You can do it.

23:10.419 --> 23:12.120
Yeah, let's go.
Let's go.

23:12.187 --> 23:14.856
Thank you.
Let's go.

23:14.923 --> 23:17.759
After hopefully
energizing Mitch,

23:17.826 --> 23:19.194
Chef Ramsay
turns his attention

23:19.261 --> 23:20.295
to the menu.

23:20.362 --> 23:22.731
Okay, Mario, let's go.

23:22.798 --> 23:24.099
Adding two appropriate specials:

23:24.166 --> 23:26.101
Authentic
Irish shepherd's pie

23:26.168 --> 23:28.170
and fish and chips.

23:28.237 --> 23:30.305
Okay, cut up the vegetables
nice and fine,

23:30.405 --> 23:31.673
so as it starts to cook,

23:31.740 --> 23:33.875
it disintegrates
in the mince.

23:33.942 --> 23:35.644
Salt, please.

23:35.711 --> 23:37.613
I know you don't use it.

23:37.679 --> 23:40.048
Salt? Salt?

23:40.115 --> 23:41.116
Salt. Not over there.

23:41.183 --> 23:42.084
Thank you.

23:42.184 --> 23:43.118
Seasoned.

23:43.218 --> 23:44.720
Okay, from there,

23:44.786 --> 23:47.256
mashed potatoes
made with cheese.

23:47.322 --> 23:48.890
It seasons it.

23:48.957 --> 23:50.525
Come on, guys.
I want you to taste it.

23:50.592 --> 23:52.394
The shepherd's pie
was awesome.

23:52.461 --> 23:53.629
I was excited about that.

23:53.695 --> 23:55.097
I enjoyed it.
My staff enjoyed it.

23:55.163 --> 23:56.398
And I hope the customers
will too.

23:56.465 --> 23:57.833
Okay, the fish.

23:57.899 --> 23:59.768
Lightly seasoned flour.

23:59.835 --> 24:01.370
You don't want to just
drop it in, right?

24:01.436 --> 24:01.721
No. Guys,
it's a piece of fish.

24:01.721 --> 24:03.238
No. Guys,
it's a piece of fish.

24:03.305 --> 24:04.506
Tell me it's not
a dish cloth.

24:04.573 --> 24:08.543
Crisp batter.
So season it as it cools down.

24:08.610 --> 24:09.544
Chief, what do you think?

24:09.611 --> 24:10.912
Oh, that's it.

24:10.979 --> 24:12.180
We should do this
long time ago.

24:12.247 --> 24:14.082
Two specials.
We roll with them.

24:14.149 --> 24:15.384
'Cause I'm with you,

24:15.450 --> 24:16.918
you're expediting
big time.

24:16.985 --> 24:18.987
I don't know if I'm gonna
be the leader,

24:19.054 --> 24:19.988
but I'm gonna try.

24:20.055 --> 24:21.023
I'm not confident.

24:21.089 --> 24:22.291
I just wanna--

24:22.357 --> 24:25.060
I just wanna
crawl into a  hole.

24:25.127 --> 24:26.495
Coming up...

24:26.561 --> 24:28.497
We cannot servethat.

24:28.563 --> 24:31.166
Chef Ramsay gets to observe
a dinner service.

24:31.233 --> 24:31.721
It's raw.

24:31.721 --> 24:32.834
It's raw.

24:32.901 --> 24:34.736
Will Mitch find his confidence?

24:34.803 --> 24:36.438
You're not helping any!
You're not doing anything here!

24:36.505 --> 24:38.206
So what good are you?

24:38.273 --> 24:39.675
Will the kitchen staff
rise to the occasion?

24:39.741 --> 24:41.677
Where's the standard?

24:41.743 --> 24:43.645
And will this family
finally come together?

24:43.712 --> 24:45.247
Get out of the kitchen!
Shut up!

24:45.314 --> 24:47.282
Why are you telling me
to shut up?
I said shut up!

24:47.349 --> 24:48.650
One thing's for sure,

24:48.717 --> 24:51.520
Chef Ramsay has his work
cut out for him.

24:51.586 --> 24:54.289
We are not gonna continue
along these lines.

24:54.356 --> 24:55.390
Stop, hey!

24:55.457 --> 24:56.591
That's all coming up

24:56.658 --> 24:57.859
on Kitchen Nightmares.

25:04.457 --> 25:07.093
After refusing to open
on night one...

25:07.126 --> 25:10.129
I am not serving
that  in there.

25:10.196 --> 25:12.698
Chef Ramsay strengthens
the menu

25:12.765 --> 25:14.100
with his version
of a shepherd's pie

25:14.166 --> 25:15.401
and fish and chips.

25:15.468 --> 25:16.535
Oh, that's it.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.170
Now he is hoping to get

25:18.237 --> 25:19.305
some encouraging signs

25:19.371 --> 25:20.873
as he watches Mitch
and his staff

25:20.940 --> 25:22.241
during a dinner service.

25:22.308 --> 25:24.944
Okay, uh...
Javier.

25:25.010 --> 25:27.046
- Excuse me?
- The fish and chips?

25:27.113 --> 25:28.447
I haven't got a clue
what he said.

25:28.514 --> 25:30.149
Is that Spanish, Scottish,
Irish--what's he talking about?

25:30.216 --> 25:30.933
The fish and chips
we make by order?

25:30.933 --> 25:32.752
The fish and chips
we make by order?

25:32.852 --> 25:34.086
Cheese what?

25:34.153 --> 25:35.855
Are you making the fish
and chips by order?

25:35.921 --> 25:37.857
What do you mean
"by order"?

25:37.923 --> 25:39.225
You cook it
in advance sometimes?

25:39.291 --> 25:41.460
No, you're not
precookin' nothin'.

25:41.527 --> 25:42.595
No.

25:42.661 --> 25:44.363
They fry fish up
in advance?

25:44.430 --> 25:46.198
You're kidding me..

25:48.834 --> 25:51.070
A burger takes
ten minutes to cook.

25:51.137 --> 25:53.172
You can't cook
a burger faster.

25:53.239 --> 25:54.473
When it's cooked,
we send it.

25:55.574 --> 25:57.109
Ah,.

26:02.148 --> 26:03.048
Okay, here we go.

26:03.149 --> 26:04.383
Hello, how are you?

26:04.450 --> 26:06.585
We have two
homemade specials

26:06.652 --> 26:08.587
the shepherd's pie
and fish and chips.

26:08.654 --> 26:09.688
I'll have
the fish and chips.

26:09.789 --> 26:11.223
I'm gonna get
the shepherd's pie.

26:11.290 --> 26:12.558
I'll have
the fish and chips.

26:12.625 --> 26:14.293
Mitch, here we go.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.461
First table's here, yes?

26:15.528 --> 26:17.062
Where you going?
Stay here.

26:17.129 --> 26:18.230
Where is he going?

26:18.297 --> 26:19.198
I don't know
where he's going.

26:19.265 --> 26:20.766
Timbuktu or a  island.

26:20.833 --> 26:22.101
I don't know where--
Just relax, relax.

26:22.168 --> 26:24.203
Told you to stay there.
I'm not going anywhere!

26:24.270 --> 26:25.771
No way are you
anybody's bitch tonight.

26:25.838 --> 26:27.506
Come on.
Okay.

26:27.573 --> 26:30.242
I need one
fish and chip special

26:30.309 --> 26:30.933
and three shepherd pie
specials.

26:30.933 --> 26:32.378
and three shepherd pie
specials.

26:32.444 --> 26:33.445
Yes, Mitch.

26:35.681 --> 26:38.617
Mario's the only one
that's listening to Mitch!

26:38.684 --> 26:40.352
Everybody got me, right?

26:40.419 --> 26:42.421
Hello down there?

26:42.488 --> 26:45.891
I need beer battered
Irish sausage and chips.

26:47.426 --> 26:48.894
"Yes, Mitch!"
Yes, Mitch!

26:48.961 --> 26:50.529
Listen up!

26:50.596 --> 26:51.664
I need a fish and chips,

26:51.730 --> 26:53.365
a shepherd's pie,

26:53.432 --> 26:54.633
and a sliced steak.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.268
Yes, Mitch!

26:56.335 --> 26:57.503
It appears as though Mitch
and the kitchen

26:57.570 --> 26:59.271
Are now on the same page.

26:59.338 --> 27:00.933
And the cooks are beginning
to fill the orders.

27:00.933 --> 27:01.006
And the cooks are beginning
to fill the orders.

27:02.208 --> 27:03.709
What'd she say, 40?

27:03.776 --> 27:05.411
Huh?
I don't know.
I don't have--

27:05.477 --> 27:07.346
- I'll have to wait till she comes back.
-  Ah,.

27:07.413 --> 27:08.948
But Chef Ramsay notices

27:09.014 --> 27:10.749
Another potential
communication problem.

27:10.816 --> 27:12.017
Don't you have
a copy of the tickets?

27:12.084 --> 27:14.119
No, I don't have them.

27:14.186 --> 27:16.488
An expediter needs
the control of the tickets.

27:16.555 --> 27:20.259
Wow, you haven't even got
a decent P.O.S. system.

27:21.994 --> 27:24.263
There's the order.
I need that now.

27:24.330 --> 27:25.865
Just get it!
Yeah.

27:25.931 --> 27:28.367
There's confusion
with the dupes all the time,

27:28.434 --> 27:29.902
'cause it's
all handwritten.

27:29.969 --> 27:30.933
It's so antiquated,
it's just...

27:30.933 --> 27:31.770
It's so antiquated,
it's just...

27:31.871 --> 27:33.072
It's ridiculous.

27:33.138 --> 27:34.840
Come on, guys, tickets
are piling up.

27:38.344 --> 27:40.646
I did, but it's fine.

27:40.713 --> 27:42.514
While the chefs rush
to push food out...

27:42.581 --> 27:43.616
Just stop.

27:43.682 --> 27:44.917
That was the French
onion soup.

27:44.984 --> 27:46.185
Little attention is being paid

27:46.252 --> 27:48.120
To quality control.

27:48.187 --> 27:49.355
Just stop
for two seconds.

27:49.421 --> 27:52.658
Look...we cannot
servethat.

27:52.725 --> 27:54.927
We cannot go
to this extent

27:54.994 --> 27:57.730
and try to start
building a reputation

27:57.796 --> 27:58.964
and serve in that.

27:59.031 --> 28:00.566
When you're the expeditor,

28:00.633 --> 28:00.933
you're the last
point of control.

28:00.933 --> 28:01.700
you're the last
point of control.

28:01.767 --> 28:02.668
Control, right.

28:02.735 --> 28:04.169
So your standards

28:04.236 --> 28:05.170
are there.

28:05.237 --> 28:06.405
Their standards are there.

28:06.472 --> 28:08.474
You've got to start

28:08.540 --> 28:09.808
putting in some structure.

28:09.875 --> 28:12.344
Come on, Mitch, please.

28:12.411 --> 28:14.313
This one here.
We're working on it, Chief.

28:14.380 --> 28:16.382
You wait a long,
long time.

28:16.448 --> 28:18.484
Get the  out!

28:18.550 --> 28:20.252
Fish and chips, 43.

28:20.319 --> 28:22.488
After a slow start...

28:22.554 --> 28:23.923
Fish and chips.

28:23.989 --> 28:25.858
Food is now making
its way out to the diners.

28:25.925 --> 28:27.726
Everything's good?
It's okay.

28:27.793 --> 28:30.562
And while the new specials
are making a good impression...

28:33.198 --> 28:34.300
Yeah.

28:34.366 --> 28:35.267
The regular menu...

28:37.403 --> 28:39.038
That's, like, raw.

28:39.104 --> 28:40.506
Isn't impressing anyone.

28:40.572 --> 28:41.840
That's disgusting!

28:41.907 --> 28:42.841
This is gross.

28:44.977 --> 28:46.578
My apologies.
Okay, hon.

28:49.315 --> 28:51.216
That's supposed to be
medium well.

28:51.317 --> 28:52.518
And that's medium rare.

28:52.584 --> 28:54.687
Come on, guys.

28:54.753 --> 28:55.821
All right, I need
another burger!

28:55.888 --> 28:57.156
Medium well!

28:57.222 --> 28:59.825
Where's the standard?

28:59.892 --> 29:00.933
One burger.
Come on, guys.

29:00.933 --> 29:01.860
One burger.
Come on, guys.

29:01.927 --> 29:03.462
How could you
up a hamburger?

29:03.529 --> 29:05.631
I'm so upset.

29:07.633 --> 29:08.734
Medium, yes?

29:08.801 --> 29:10.302
Yes.

29:13.806 --> 29:15.174
Come here.

29:16.475 --> 29:18.377
All of you come here.

29:20.746 --> 29:21.780
Touch it.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.515
It's  raw.

29:25.317 --> 29:26.285
Did you check it?

29:26.352 --> 29:28.754
No, I didn't.
Come on.

29:28.821 --> 29:29.822
Mario!

29:29.888 --> 29:30.933
All I want
is a burger!

29:30.933 --> 29:32.057
All I want
is a burger!

29:32.124 --> 29:34.994
A  burger.

29:35.060 --> 29:36.428
Come on.

29:36.495 --> 29:38.397
What the
is going on?

29:40.499 --> 29:41.500
See if you can go outside
and say hi to people.

29:41.567 --> 29:42.968
No, I can't just go out

29:43.035 --> 29:44.670
because there's no food.
you're not helping any.

29:44.737 --> 29:47.573
You're not doing anything here,
so what good are you?

29:47.639 --> 29:49.475
Two hours into dinner service,

29:49.541 --> 29:50.909
And the kitchen
is beginning to unravel.

29:50.976 --> 29:52.778
It's soft!

29:53.879 --> 29:54.880
This is ice cold.

29:54.947 --> 29:55.948
With dish...

29:56.015 --> 29:57.817
Is that, uh, too rare?
Rare.

29:57.883 --> 29:58.784
After dish...

29:58.851 --> 29:59.986
The penne's raw?

30:00.052 --> 30:00.933
Coming back.

30:00.933 --> 30:01.420
Coming back.

30:01.487 --> 30:02.455
Ah, dear.

30:02.521 --> 30:03.589
Sorry.
Could I just--

30:03.656 --> 30:05.057
would you mind if I just
take that away?

30:05.124 --> 30:06.225
Two seconds.
I'm so sorry.

30:06.292 --> 30:07.960
Excuse me.
Have you got two seconds?

30:08.060 --> 30:09.061
Maureen.

30:11.430 --> 30:12.465
What is that?

30:13.866 --> 30:15.101
Let me just
tell you something.

30:15.167 --> 30:16.769
When I was busting
my chops earlier

30:16.836 --> 30:18.170
making it for you,

30:18.237 --> 30:19.872
I turn my back
for five minutes,

30:19.939 --> 30:21.574
and you send that out.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.275
Chef...
Chef...

30:23.376 --> 30:25.011
Come on, guys.

30:25.077 --> 30:27.646
On the back
of 115 customers,

30:27.713 --> 30:29.515
in 2 1/2 hours,

30:29.582 --> 30:30.933
results in that.

30:30.933 --> 30:31.784
results in that.

30:31.851 --> 30:34.220
Chef Ramsay was just like,
"To hell with all of youse.

30:34.286 --> 30:35.688
"There's no passion,
there's no care

30:35.755 --> 30:36.756
for any of the food
coming out."

30:36.822 --> 30:39.191
All you  get paid!

30:39.258 --> 30:40.926
Where's the worry
in your faces?

30:40.993 --> 30:43.095
If you were my brigade,

30:43.162 --> 30:45.398
I would have fired you
16 years ago.

30:45.464 --> 30:49.135
You, you, you, you, you,
you, and  you!

30:58.160 --> 31:00.930
The dinner service is now
approaching three hours.

31:00.996 --> 31:02.965
It's raw.

31:03.032 --> 31:04.500
And a steady stream of dishes

31:04.567 --> 31:06.168
has been returned
to the kitchen.

31:06.235 --> 31:07.837
If you were my brigade,

31:07.903 --> 31:10.806
I would have fired you
16 years ago!

31:10.873 --> 31:12.408
Chef Ramsay is fed up,

31:12.475 --> 31:14.143
and he knows he needs to make
an unusual move

31:14.210 --> 31:16.011
to save this restaurant.

31:16.078 --> 31:19.048
Hi. James, it's Gordon.

31:19.115 --> 31:20.716
Yeah, listen, uh, buddy,
I need some help.

31:20.783 --> 31:22.518
Um, I need it quickly.

31:22.585 --> 31:24.620
Um, can you get, uh,
yourself down here?

31:24.687 --> 31:25.053
The Grasshopper.

31:25.053 --> 31:26.122
The Grasshopper.

31:26.188 --> 31:27.189
Please.

31:27.256 --> 31:29.225
Ay, yi, yi, yi.

31:29.291 --> 31:31.360
Two more, right?

31:31.427 --> 31:33.229
Back inside the restaurant...

31:33.295 --> 31:36.098
What's going on
with the last one?

31:36.165 --> 31:38.134
The final orders
of the night go out.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.536
Thank you very much.
Have a good night.

31:40.636 --> 31:42.471
That was a disaster.

31:42.538 --> 31:44.039
Brutal.
That was really brutal.

31:44.106 --> 31:46.108
I'm shocked.
I'm drained.

31:46.175 --> 31:47.877
Tired.

31:50.980 --> 31:52.214
Whew, that was rough.

31:52.281 --> 31:54.583
A real frickin' disaster.

31:56.152 --> 31:57.787
In there...

31:57.853 --> 31:59.355
They turn up,

31:59.421 --> 32:00.589
they pick up their check,

32:00.656 --> 32:02.591
and they piss off home.

32:02.691 --> 32:04.059
They're not here for you.

32:04.126 --> 32:06.762
I realized I have
to do something drastic.

32:06.829 --> 32:11.267
I've called a very talented
local chef,

32:11.333 --> 32:12.568
and he just got here.

32:12.635 --> 32:14.236
James, please.

32:14.303 --> 32:15.638
This guy's worked with

32:15.704 --> 32:16.705
some of the best restaurants
in America.

32:16.772 --> 32:18.040
Hi, Chef.
Good to see you.

32:18.107 --> 32:19.208
You too.

32:19.275 --> 32:21.277
Tomorrow, he's gonna
work with me

32:21.343 --> 32:24.713
and implement
a standard here that needs

32:24.780 --> 32:25.053
to be put in place
to move forward.

32:25.053 --> 32:26.649
to be put in place
to move forward.

32:26.715 --> 32:28.684
And, by the way,

32:28.751 --> 32:30.152
he's not only a chef...

32:30.219 --> 32:31.887
He's Irish.

32:31.954 --> 32:33.622
Tomorrow, when we launch,

32:33.722 --> 32:34.957
we stick together

32:35.024 --> 32:36.859
as a team
and we kick ass.

32:36.926 --> 32:38.294
Thank you, Chef.
I'll see you
in the morning.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.495
Good night.
Thank you.

32:39.562 --> 32:40.896
Thank you very much.

32:42.631 --> 32:44.266
After the arrival Chef James,

32:44.333 --> 32:45.901
Chef Ramsay
decided to go ahead

32:45.968 --> 32:47.136
with his overnight plan

32:47.203 --> 32:48.904
of giving
the dreary Grasshopper

32:48.971 --> 32:51.040
a much-needed makeover.

32:51.106 --> 32:53.375
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

32:53.442 --> 32:54.944
Today is the beginning
of the new Grasshopper.

32:55.010 --> 32:55.053
Yes, absolutely.

32:55.053 --> 32:56.445
Yes, absolutely.

32:56.512 --> 32:57.513
Ready? Let's go.

32:57.580 --> 32:59.248
Come have a look.

32:59.315 --> 33:00.382
Welcome to
the new Grasshopper.

33:00.449 --> 33:01.684
Look!
Oh, my God.

33:01.750 --> 33:03.085
Chief, look at this.

33:03.152 --> 33:04.587
My God.

33:04.653 --> 33:05.855
Love it, it looks awesome.

33:05.921 --> 33:08.224
Yeah, it's absolutely
fabulous.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.592
Gone are the dark,
dingy colors.

33:09.658 --> 33:10.759
The green walls have gone.

33:10.826 --> 33:12.294
Very exciting.

33:12.361 --> 33:14.196
Welcome to the new,
beautiful, vibrant color.

33:14.263 --> 33:15.564
Awesome.

33:15.631 --> 33:17.533
The mahogany looks much nicer
with the champagne wall.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.767
It's incredible.

33:18.834 --> 33:21.470
It's bright, it's cheery.

33:21.570 --> 33:23.439
Everything is beautiful.

33:23.505 --> 33:24.506
Mitch, are you happy?
Definitely am.

33:24.573 --> 33:25.053
Yeah? Good.
Maureen, you happy?

33:25.053 --> 33:26.141
Yeah? Good.
Maureen, you happy?

33:26.208 --> 33:27.710
Yeah?

33:27.776 --> 33:28.911
Come on, you guys

33:28.978 --> 33:31.614
have got to come
together, yes?

33:31.680 --> 33:33.782
We replaced
the old stained glass.

33:33.849 --> 33:35.751
We've got some
modern style lamps.

33:35.818 --> 33:36.719
I love these lamps.

33:36.785 --> 33:37.753
Mitch, you happy?

33:37.820 --> 33:39.088
This put an extra spring
in your step?

33:39.154 --> 33:40.222
It's great.
I love it.

33:40.289 --> 33:41.457
It's a breath
of fresh air.

33:41.590 --> 33:42.858
This table, beautiful.

33:42.925 --> 33:44.660
A local artist designed it.

33:44.727 --> 33:46.295
Look how good
this looks in here.

33:46.362 --> 33:48.130
This is unbelievable.

33:48.197 --> 33:49.465
It's positioned in the center
of the room

33:49.531 --> 33:51.600
so it becomes a sort of
focal family table.

33:51.667 --> 33:52.701
This whole thing has just

33:52.768 --> 33:53.869
got a breath
of fresh air to it.

33:55.871 --> 33:57.139
Happy? Oh, good.

33:57.206 --> 33:58.574
There is life
back in this place.

33:58.641 --> 34:01.176
I can't wait to see
our customers' faces

34:01.243 --> 34:05.180
when they first come to see
the new, improved Grasshopper.

34:05.247 --> 34:07.049
I did make one more
significant change.

34:07.116 --> 34:09.985
Annette, put your hands
on that box.

34:10.052 --> 34:11.754
You've been stuck
in the dark ages

34:11.820 --> 34:14.123
with this horrendous way
of taking orders.

34:14.189 --> 34:15.190
This is now

34:15.257 --> 34:16.625
gonna make your life
so much easier.

34:18.794 --> 34:20.496
Extraordinary.
Oh, my God.

34:21.864 --> 34:23.465
Amazing.
The state of the art.

34:23.532 --> 34:25.053
P.O.S. system by Halo.

34:25.053 --> 34:26.302
P.O.S. system by Halo.

34:26.368 --> 34:27.670
I can't imagine how much it's
gonna change everything for us.

34:27.736 --> 34:29.104
It's gonna make you
so much more efficient.

34:29.204 --> 34:31.440
I'm telling you,
this is so unbelievable.

34:31.507 --> 34:33.042
Come here. Come here,
come here, come here.

34:33.108 --> 34:34.877
Ah, you're an amazing guy.

34:37.179 --> 34:40.215
Tonight, we have got
to make it happen.

34:40.282 --> 34:41.450
Absolutely.

34:41.517 --> 34:43.285
We have got to be
on top of it all tonight.

34:43.352 --> 34:45.187
Mitch looked at me,

34:45.254 --> 34:46.522
And he had tears
in his eyes,

34:46.588 --> 34:49.024
and he said, "Maybe this
is our opportunity."

34:49.091 --> 34:50.326
The change in the decor

34:50.392 --> 34:52.294
will make the Grasshopper
more inviting.

34:52.361 --> 34:53.595
But the most critical
makeover

34:53.662 --> 34:54.930
has been made
to the menu.

34:54.997 --> 34:55.053
Gone are the greasy, tired,
uninspired dishes.

34:55.053 --> 34:58.434
Gone are the greasy, tired,
uninspired dishes.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.502
And in its place are new,
vibrant,

35:00.569 --> 35:03.772
Irish-American dishes that
are not only pleasing to the eye

35:03.839 --> 35:05.474
but rich in taste and flavor.

35:05.541 --> 35:07.242
Welcome to
the Grasshopper new menu.

35:07.309 --> 35:08.544
Clearly smaller.

35:08.610 --> 35:09.611
Why is it smaller?

35:09.678 --> 35:11.580
Quality,
controlling the costs.

35:11.647 --> 35:13.048
You're trying
to get consistent.

35:13.115 --> 35:14.950
Irish potato skins,

35:15.017 --> 35:16.452
fresh mozzarella sticks,

35:16.518 --> 35:17.886
corned beef with
carrots and potatoes.

35:17.953 --> 35:19.822
The house burger
with Irish cheddar.

35:19.888 --> 35:22.057
Shepherd's pie with
the most amazing mash.

35:22.124 --> 35:24.460
Chief, especially for you,
Irish ale stew.

35:24.526 --> 35:25.053
Unbelievable.

35:25.053 --> 35:25.527
Unbelievable.

35:25.594 --> 35:26.528
When he came along

35:26.595 --> 35:27.563
and showed us that Irish menu,

35:27.663 --> 35:28.597
the way he had it made up,

35:28.664 --> 35:30.432
I said, "This is it."

35:30.499 --> 35:31.934
It's absolutely
gorgeous.

35:32.001 --> 35:33.435
The new menu is fabulous.

35:33.502 --> 35:35.204
I'm really, really
excited about it.

35:35.270 --> 35:37.706
Get the staff.
A little taste.

35:37.773 --> 35:39.575
This food has spirit
and life to it.

35:39.641 --> 35:41.443
So it'll change this place.

35:41.510 --> 35:43.145
Just like mama
used to make.

35:45.547 --> 35:46.682
Chief...

35:46.749 --> 35:48.550
You need to be honest,
firm...
Firm.

35:48.617 --> 35:50.386
And you can't
stop being firm.

35:50.452 --> 35:52.454
No, no, no.
And you call it
as you see it.

35:52.521 --> 35:54.056
And they have to listen,
'cause you know why?

35:54.123 --> 35:55.053
'Cause you're wise.

35:55.053 --> 35:55.124
'Cause you're wise.

35:55.190 --> 35:56.158
That's right.

35:56.225 --> 35:58.360
You've had success
in your...life.

35:58.427 --> 35:59.962
There's only one chief,
and you're it.

36:00.062 --> 36:01.296
Yeah, okay.

36:05.234 --> 36:07.069
Hi, folks.
Welcome to the Grasshopper.

36:07.136 --> 36:09.571
This is our new menu.

36:09.638 --> 36:12.074
The whole new menu
just looks delicious.

36:12.141 --> 36:14.977
I'm gonna have the potato--
the beer potato soup.

36:15.044 --> 36:16.078
Shepherd's pie.

36:16.145 --> 36:17.079
Tonight, Chef James

36:17.179 --> 36:18.347
Will be behind the line,

36:18.414 --> 36:19.515
overseeing the cooks...

36:19.581 --> 36:20.482
You got all your sauces.

36:20.582 --> 36:21.650
Keep turning.

36:21.717 --> 36:22.818
And Mitch,

36:22.885 --> 36:23.819
who is desperate
not to repeat

36:23.886 --> 36:25.020
last night's disaster,

36:25.087 --> 36:26.488
will be expediting.

36:26.555 --> 36:27.523
All right, can I get

36:27.589 --> 36:29.659
two beer battered shrimp,

36:29.726 --> 36:31.461
lamb sliders.

36:31.527 --> 36:33.329
Give me five.
Give me five soups.

36:33.396 --> 36:35.298
Five potato soups,
all day!

36:35.365 --> 36:36.566
I got this.
Come on.

36:36.632 --> 36:38.768
Okay, you gotta put
more parsley on this.

36:38.834 --> 36:40.870
With Chef James
controlling the line...

36:40.937 --> 36:42.338
You keep that and
put it in the window.

36:42.405 --> 36:43.673
Don't worry,
he doesn't need to take it.

36:43.739 --> 36:45.608
41, huh, Mitch, 41!
There you go.

36:45.708 --> 36:47.410
Thank you! That's done?

36:47.476 --> 36:48.678
Appetizers are moving out

36:48.744 --> 36:49.946
Quickly to the customers.

36:50.012 --> 36:51.447
This is really good.

36:51.514 --> 36:53.983
Wow. Oh, wow.

36:54.083 --> 36:55.053
Thank you very much.

36:55.053 --> 36:56.752
Thank you very much.

36:56.819 --> 36:58.487
It's good.

36:58.554 --> 37:00.189
Now the pressure
shifts to Mitch,

37:00.256 --> 37:02.825
to keep the kitchen organized
and the momentum going.

37:02.892 --> 37:06.862
All right,
just fire the, uh...

37:07.997 --> 37:09.131
What do you have?

37:09.198 --> 37:11.100
I need a beer battered
shrimp

37:11.167 --> 37:15.237
and a pi--and
a ham and pea soup.

37:15.304 --> 37:16.906
Can you--can you
call it again, please?

37:18.407 --> 37:19.742
When I was watching
Mitch expedite,

37:19.809 --> 37:21.377
I noticed that he wasn't
communicating with the line

37:21.444 --> 37:23.279
the way he
should have been.

37:23.346 --> 37:25.053
And he was getting
himself backed up.

37:25.053 --> 37:25.548
And he was getting
himself backed up.

37:25.614 --> 37:28.217
That's gonna be--this
is gonna get  here.

37:28.284 --> 37:30.086
I don't like this.

37:30.152 --> 37:31.854
Mitch! Come on, you gotta
talk them, Mitch.

37:31.921 --> 37:33.723
You--you're--you're it.

37:33.789 --> 37:35.324
Come on, guys,
let's go, all right?

37:35.391 --> 37:36.392
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

37:36.459 --> 37:38.561
Yes.

37:38.661 --> 37:39.929
Fire the entrees!

37:39.996 --> 37:41.197
He's gonna cook
what you tell him!

37:41.297 --> 37:42.298
Okay, I'm sorry.

37:45.835 --> 37:47.703
I need a poor boy.
I need two poor boys.

37:47.770 --> 37:48.904
Lamb sliders.
Two shrimp.

37:48.971 --> 37:51.307
A battered shrimp.
Three battered shrimp.

37:54.710 --> 37:55.053
The first appetizers
went out brilliantly.

37:55.053 --> 37:56.445
The first appetizers
went out brilliantly.

37:56.512 --> 37:58.014
But we have a real problem
in the kitchen.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.348
And that's Mitch's
expediting.

37:59.415 --> 38:00.950
You gotta get
a system going.

38:01.017 --> 38:02.785
Just think, you gotta
get a system going.

38:02.852 --> 38:04.487
If this guy was
an air traffic controller,

38:04.553 --> 38:05.755
he'd be landing planes

38:05.821 --> 38:08.124
at the wrong
frickin' airport.

38:10.559 --> 38:12.595
While customers anxiously
wait for the food...

38:15.264 --> 38:17.800
You got your food yet?

38:17.867 --> 38:20.302
Chef Ramsay is still waiting
for Mitch to step up

38:20.369 --> 38:22.304
And take control
of his kitchen.

38:22.371 --> 38:23.472
I have a fish and chips!

38:23.539 --> 38:25.053
An Irish stew!

38:25.053 --> 38:25.875
An Irish stew!

38:25.941 --> 38:28.177
Is that a wait
or an order?

38:30.913 --> 38:32.281
Oh, come on.

38:32.348 --> 38:33.849
Oh, come on.

38:33.916 --> 38:35.551
Come on!

38:35.618 --> 38:38.421
Mitch, you cannot
do that to us!

38:38.487 --> 38:40.322
With the kitchen at
a complete standstill...

38:42.591 --> 38:43.559
Dad, please.

38:43.626 --> 38:44.660
A frustrated chief

38:44.727 --> 38:46.228
tries to help out.

38:46.295 --> 38:47.530
Mitch...
Out of the kitchen.

38:47.596 --> 38:49.331
But it's not exactly welcomed.

38:49.432 --> 38:50.900
Don't  me.

38:50.966 --> 38:52.701
Shut up!
Why are you
telling me to shut up?

38:52.768 --> 38:53.803
Out of the kitchen!
I said shut up!

38:53.869 --> 38:55.053
That's not right.
Get out of the kitchen!

38:55.053 --> 38:56.272
That's not right.
Get out of the kitchen!

38:56.372 --> 38:57.907
Just stop!

38:57.973 --> 38:59.575
Just stop!
It's not right!

38:59.675 --> 39:01.777
Mario...Stop!

39:11.987 --> 39:13.556
It's relaunch night
at the Grasshopper.

39:13.622 --> 39:14.890
Come on!

39:14.957 --> 39:15.958
And despite providing Mitch

39:16.025 --> 39:17.059
with a new, tasty menu...

39:17.126 --> 39:18.594
It's good.

39:18.661 --> 39:20.896
And Chef James
to supervise the cooks...

39:20.963 --> 39:22.097
You keep that
and put it in the window.

39:22.164 --> 39:23.532
Don't worry, he doesn't
need the ticket.

39:23.599 --> 39:25.067
Mitch's failure in the kitchen

39:25.134 --> 39:26.836
has resulted in a battle
between his wife

39:26.902 --> 39:28.037
and his father-in-law.

39:28.103 --> 39:30.272
Shut up!
Why are you
telling me to shut up?

39:30.339 --> 39:31.407
I said shut up!

39:31.474 --> 39:33.576
Just stop!
Stop, hey!

39:33.642 --> 39:35.211
And Chef Ramsay has had enough.

39:35.277 --> 39:37.613
We are not gonna continue
along these lines.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.180
James...

39:39.180 --> 39:39.615
James...

39:39.682 --> 39:40.583
I'm sorry.

39:40.649 --> 39:42.485
Come down, please!

39:42.551 --> 39:44.053
Mitch, I want you
assisting James.

39:44.119 --> 39:45.387
James, I want you
expediting.

39:45.454 --> 39:47.156
All right, guys, let's go.
Regroup!

39:47.223 --> 39:49.458
For the first time
in 16  years,

39:49.558 --> 39:50.559
Work together!

39:50.626 --> 39:51.794
Yes!
Start again!

39:51.894 --> 39:53.395
Take over, please.

39:53.462 --> 39:55.764
Chef, I need those five soups
right away.

39:55.831 --> 39:57.032
Listen and assist him.

39:57.099 --> 39:58.067
I am.
Potato skins.

39:58.133 --> 39:59.301
You need this first,
right now.

39:59.368 --> 40:01.237
Thank you.
All right, that's going.

40:01.303 --> 40:02.271
Well, run it
out there, Mitch.

40:02.338 --> 40:03.272
Run it out there.
Yeah.

40:03.339 --> 40:05.774
Finally, I found
a job for Mitch.

40:05.875 --> 40:07.376
He's running food out.

40:09.044 --> 40:09.180
Potato skins?

40:09.180 --> 40:09.979
Potato skins?

40:12.081 --> 40:13.249
What table number?

40:13.315 --> 40:15.484
Where you going
with them?

40:15.551 --> 40:17.319
Where are you
going with them?

40:17.386 --> 40:19.221
Potato skins?

40:19.321 --> 40:20.322
This is 22.

40:21.423 --> 40:22.758
I was going with food.

40:22.825 --> 40:24.593
Every table said,
"I didn't order that."

40:24.660 --> 40:26.462
Hi.
Oh, no, I got pasta.

40:26.529 --> 40:27.830
No, she got pasta.

40:27.897 --> 40:28.964
I was going to all
the wrong tables.

40:29.031 --> 40:30.165
Oh, this sucks.

40:30.232 --> 40:32.134
I don't want
to do this anymore.

40:33.969 --> 40:35.004
Table 40, runner, please!

40:35.070 --> 40:37.239
All right.
Mitch, get out!

40:37.306 --> 40:39.180
You! Let's go.

40:39.180 --> 40:40.442
You! Let's go.

40:40.509 --> 40:41.777
We're making progress.
Let's go.

40:41.844 --> 40:43.045
Chip away at this.

40:43.112 --> 40:44.446
Chef Ramsay's decision

40:44.513 --> 40:45.981
to move Mitch
out of the kitchen

40:46.048 --> 40:48.784
and replace him with Chef James
as the expeditor...

40:48.851 --> 40:50.319
Guys, I have three tickets
in front of me.

40:50.386 --> 40:51.921
We're almost there.

40:51.987 --> 40:54.223
Has completely turned around
dinner service.

40:54.290 --> 40:55.891
Customers are now
getting their food.

40:55.958 --> 40:57.593
These are really good.

40:57.660 --> 40:59.228
And are thrilled
with what they are getting.

40:59.328 --> 41:00.529
Definitely coming back.

41:00.596 --> 41:01.530
I'm out of tickets.

41:01.597 --> 41:03.098
So, guys, that's it.

41:03.165 --> 41:04.233
All right,
thank you very much.

41:04.300 --> 41:05.935
Thank you, guys.

41:06.101 --> 41:08.270
As a difficult dinner service

41:08.337 --> 41:09.180
finally comes to an end,

41:09.180 --> 41:09.738
finally comes to an end,

41:09.805 --> 41:11.607
Chef Ramsay knows
he has to have

41:11.674 --> 41:14.343
a difficult conversation
with the owners.

41:14.410 --> 41:17.079
Okay, I'm gonna be
brutally honest.

41:17.313 --> 41:21.517
This restaurant
will not succeed

41:21.617 --> 41:22.885
unless you make

41:22.952 --> 41:26.689
the necessary staff changes.

41:26.755 --> 41:28.591
And you can make it work.

41:28.657 --> 41:31.594
Mitch, I know you
weren't...

41:31.660 --> 41:33.229
professionally trained.

41:33.295 --> 41:34.830
But it's down to you.

41:34.897 --> 41:36.365
Yes.

41:36.432 --> 41:38.534
I brought you James.

41:38.601 --> 41:39.180
The expertise
that you desperately need

41:39.180 --> 41:40.569
The expertise
that you desperately need

41:40.636 --> 41:42.705
to get this ship...

41:42.771 --> 41:44.006
back on course.

41:44.073 --> 41:45.741
Take advantage of James.

41:45.808 --> 41:47.943
Listen to him.

41:48.010 --> 41:49.511
Do it.

41:49.578 --> 41:51.547
And do it quick.

41:51.614 --> 41:53.616
Good night, guys.

41:56.552 --> 41:57.753
Change is scary.

41:57.820 --> 41:58.954
Good luck.

41:59.021 --> 42:01.757
But we gotta take his advice

42:01.824 --> 42:03.692
and make the right decisions.

42:06.729 --> 42:08.464
This has been one of the most
toughest nightmares

42:08.530 --> 42:09.180
I've ever done.

42:09.180 --> 42:09.932
I've ever done.

42:09.999 --> 42:11.567
Because this restaurant has
everything it needs

42:11.634 --> 42:14.236
to succeed,
except one thing...

42:14.336 --> 42:15.571
a leader.

42:15.638 --> 42:18.474
I just wish that chief
was 20 years younger

42:18.540 --> 42:21.277
because right now,
there's no one in there

42:21.343 --> 42:23.646
that can fill his shoes.

42:23.712 --> 42:26.115
Mitch, Mitch,
Mitch, Mitch, Mitch.

42:28.817 --> 42:31.220
Only days after
Chef Ramsay left,

42:31.287 --> 42:33.088
Chef Mario
was shown the door.

42:33.155 --> 42:35.591
I need a house pasta,
shrimp only, no veggies.

42:35.658 --> 42:37.359
The owners convinced
Chef James

42:37.426 --> 42:39.094
to stay on
as a consultant

42:39.161 --> 42:39.180
and properly train
the kitchen staff.

42:39.180 --> 42:40.362
and properly train
the kitchen staff.

42:40.429 --> 42:42.164
That came out great.

42:42.231 --> 42:43.766
And in the weeks that followed,

42:43.832 --> 42:46.602
Mitch took Chef Ramsay's
advice to heart.

42:46.669 --> 42:48.137
That's easy, right?
And it's sexy.

42:48.203 --> 42:49.838
Fast and Furious.

42:49.905 --> 42:51.774
Learning from Chef James...

42:51.840 --> 42:54.143
No bun for the turkey burger
and just fresh mozzarella!

42:54.209 --> 42:56.011
And finally
becoming the leader

42:56.078 --> 42:57.813
the Grasshopper
always needed.

42:57.880 --> 42:58.914
Make it nice
or make it twice!

42:58.981 --> 43:00.049
I have changed, yes.

43:00.115 --> 43:03.719
My focus is 100%
in that kitchen.

43:03.786 --> 43:05.254
Thank you, folks.

43:05.354 --> 43:07.122
Everything was good?
Okay, great.
