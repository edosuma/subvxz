WEBVTT

00:02.627 --> 00:03.927
Jess, I'm not
done with that.

00:03.961 --> 00:06.196
That's $18 granola--
handmade.

00:06.247 --> 00:07.714
$18 for granola?

00:07.748 --> 00:09.499
Okay, you're gonna be eating
two Thanksgiving meals today,

00:09.533 --> 00:10.384
so starve yourself.

00:10.418 --> 00:11.951
Jess, I get
it that your parents

00:11.985 --> 00:14.388
are divorced, but can't they
just have one meal together?

00:14.422 --> 00:15.922
Yeah, sure, they
can if they're both

00:15.940 --> 00:17.307
gagged and blindfolded.

00:17.358 --> 00:19.226
Okay, listen up, guys,
my mom is gonna be here

00:19.260 --> 00:21.094
at 9:00
and she's staying till 2:00,

00:21.112 --> 00:23.113
and then my dad's going
to be here at 2:30

00:23.147 --> 00:24.731
and he's gonna stay till 7:30.

00:24.765 --> 00:26.099
I should also
warn you guys

00:26.117 --> 00:28.118
- that my mom's a little bit perky.
- Wait,

00:28.152 --> 00:29.269
you think she's perky?

00:29.287 --> 00:30.603
Well, she doesn't have
my dark side.

00:30.621 --> 00:31.822
I got that from my dad.

00:31.873 --> 00:33.990
Nick, you're gonna love
my dad so much.

00:34.042 --> 00:35.575
He's so unhappy.

00:35.609 --> 00:37.661
I'm not into dads,
I'm not a dad guy.

00:37.712 --> 00:39.996
I don't like 'em, don't trust 'em,
never have.

00:40.048 --> 00:40.947
Oh, that's her.

00:40.965 --> 00:41.948
It's okay, man.

00:41.966 --> 00:43.800
What's okay, man?

00:43.835 --> 00:45.585
- Oh.
- Momsicle.

00:45.619 --> 00:47.521
Oh, Jujube.

00:47.555 --> 00:48.621
Wow, showed up looking
like a pilgrim.

00:48.639 --> 00:49.806
- Every year.
- Hello, everyone.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.091
- This is my mom Joan.
- Hi.

00:51.125 --> 00:52.809
- This is everybody.
- Hi.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.195
Oh, come on over, I just want
to give you all a big hug.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.531
- Oh, come on, big Thanksgiving hug.
- Do it, come on.

00:57.565 --> 00:59.533
Come on, we'll do a
big hug ball, come on.

00:59.567 --> 01:01.268
- Come on, Cece, you know
how to do this. - Yep.

01:01.302 --> 01:02.302
You in the white shirt.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.353
I don't do hug balls.

01:03.404 --> 01:04.688
Come on in.

01:04.739 --> 01:06.773
Hug ball jumping,
hug ball jumping.

01:06.807 --> 01:08.275
Okay.

01:08.309 --> 01:09.693
- All right.
- Whoo!

01:09.744 --> 01:10.994
Oh, dear God.

01:12.146 --> 01:14.047
- A hug ball?
- Dad.

01:14.082 --> 01:16.166
- Well, hello, Bob.
- You're early.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.285
You know what
I'm thankful for today?

01:18.819 --> 01:20.103
Divorce.

01:20.138 --> 01:21.621
♪ Who's that girl?

01:21.655 --> 01:24.224
♪ <i>Who's that girl?</i> ♪
♪ It's Jess.

01:28.229 --> 01:30.630
No, no, no, no, it was my
mistake, it's my mistake.

01:30.664 --> 01:32.048
I'll wait five hours

01:32.100 --> 01:33.350
and come back when
Joan's shift is up.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.218
Bob, just stay.

01:35.269 --> 01:36.570
What if we need
something ruined?

01:36.604 --> 01:38.621
- Mom!
- It's all right, I'll spend my holiday

01:38.622 --> 01:39.856
at a Los Angeles coffee shop...

01:39.891 --> 01:41.558
- No...
- sitting around with people

01:41.609 --> 01:43.860
who have nothing better
to do on Thanksgiving

01:43.895 --> 01:45.395
than work on
their screenplay.

01:45.446 --> 01:47.697
I probably won't want
to blow my head off.

01:47.732 --> 01:49.533
Bob, we are both grown-ups.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.185
We can make it through
one day together.

01:52.220 --> 01:53.420
Please, Dad.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.544
- Well done, Jessica Day.
- Pardon?

02:00.578 --> 02:04.498
"My mom's coming at 9:00 a.m.
and my dad's coming at 2:30."

02:04.532 --> 02:06.316
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

02:06.350 --> 02:08.668
The movie you made me watch
a million times.

02:08.702 --> 02:10.703
- <i>Rocky IV?</i> 
<i>- Parent Trap.</i>

02:10.721 --> 02:13.390
What?
I don't...

02:13.424 --> 02:15.041
Mm-hmm.

02:15.059 --> 02:16.209
Why would I do that?

02:16.227 --> 02:17.911
<i>Parent Trap--</i> crazy.

02:17.945 --> 02:20.713
Mom, Dad, help,
there's a man in the room.

02:20.731 --> 02:22.432
He's trying to get us
to eat candy.

02:22.483 --> 02:23.433
Jess, Jess.
Jess?

02:23.484 --> 02:24.618
Jess, are you okay?

02:24.652 --> 02:26.937
What's the matter?
Are you...?

02:26.988 --> 02:30.423
Oh, damn it, Jess,
that's the second time today.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.725
Smile, Mom, you still got it.

02:32.743 --> 02:35.061
Jessica,
what are you doing?

02:35.079 --> 02:36.780
I want him to see
what he's missing.

02:36.831 --> 02:38.532
You're texting your father?!

02:39.066 --> 02:40.967
That was a long
time ago, Cece,

02:40.985 --> 02:42.068
when I was
young and naive.

02:42.086 --> 02:43.703
- Just go.
- Excuse me.

02:46.089 --> 02:47.406
What's with all
the crappy beer, man?

02:47.424 --> 02:48.475
You hate that stuff.

02:48.509 --> 02:50.076
Let's just say that my cousin
doesn't exactly have

02:50.111 --> 02:51.928
the most sophisticated palate.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.764
Raised by wolf-like parents
in the wilds of Minnesota,

02:54.799 --> 02:56.099
he actually went to juvie

02:56.133 --> 02:57.434
for stealing
the synagogue's minivan.

02:57.468 --> 02:58.969
It's been that way
since we were kids.

02:59.003 --> 03:00.320
Made my life a living hell.

03:00.354 --> 03:03.423
I'm the strong kind
of fat.

03:04.692 --> 03:06.660
Yes, yes, yes!

03:06.694 --> 03:09.229
Please tell me he's going
to sit on you when he gets here.

03:09.263 --> 03:11.264
He's a good guy, I'm telling
you, he's totally changed.

03:11.282 --> 03:13.233
- Okay.  - He settled down with
this great woman named Krista.

03:13.267 --> 03:14.601
She's coming.

03:14.619 --> 03:16.419
Actually went to Legoland
with them last year.

03:16.453 --> 03:18.271
He didn't pressure me
to go on any of the rides

03:18.289 --> 03:19.489
I wasn't comfortable with.

03:19.540 --> 03:22.125
Ho!
Ha-ha.

03:22.159 --> 03:23.410
How you doing,
little buddy?

03:23.444 --> 03:24.411
Come here.

03:24.445 --> 03:25.795
- Oh!
- Oh!

03:25.830 --> 03:27.130
Okay.

03:27.164 --> 03:28.948
- Hey.
- What's up, man? Winston.

03:28.966 --> 03:29.966
Nice to meet you,
I'm Schmidt.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.085
I actually go by Schmidt,
uh, around here.

03:32.119 --> 03:33.470
There can only be one--
you know the rule.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.438
- Ah! Look at that right there.
- That's...

03:35.473 --> 03:36.473
Where's Krista?

03:37.007 --> 03:38.625
Krista and I have
a new arrangement.

03:38.643 --> 03:39.976
Okay.
- I, uh,

03:40.011 --> 03:41.645
I can sleep with
whoever I want,

03:41.679 --> 03:44.681
but she doesn't speak to me
or live with me any more.

03:47.651 --> 03:48.518
Hey, Dad,

03:48.569 --> 03:49.703
- you want to help us?
- I have

03:49.737 --> 03:51.154
to stay away
from salmonella.

03:51.188 --> 03:53.156
You don't
have to lick it, Bob.

03:53.190 --> 03:54.474
No, no, no,
my doctor says...

03:54.492 --> 03:57.360
It was a joke,
it was just a joke.

03:57.411 --> 03:58.445
I have a sense
of humor.

03:58.479 --> 04:00.447
If that was a joke,
here is a pencil.

04:00.481 --> 04:02.148
Draw me a map
to the joke.

04:02.166 --> 04:03.833
Guys, it doesn't have
to be like this.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.369
Mom. you're in a great
place with your practice.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.705
Dad, I'm sorry Katherine
cheated on you,

04:08.756 --> 04:10.974
- but it's been months.
- Jess.

04:11.508 --> 04:12.542
- What are you...?
- I'm sorry, I thought,

04:12.593 --> 04:14.511
I thought, I-- I'm s--
I thought everyone knew.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.463
You grieved so publicly
on Instagram--

04:16.497 --> 04:20.183
all those pictures of sad
trees and, and your lunches.

04:21.435 --> 04:22.802
Katherine cheated?

04:23.337 --> 04:24.354
Yeah.

04:24.388 --> 04:26.640
Oh, Bob, that's
terrible, I'm so sorry.

04:26.674 --> 04:27.857
- Yeah.
- No, really, I had no idea.

04:27.892 --> 04:28.858
Yeah, well, yeah.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.144
Oh, sorry, really.

04:31.178 --> 04:32.145
Come here, come
here, let me...

04:32.179 --> 04:33.513
Salmonella...

04:33.531 --> 04:34.648
- Salmonella.
- Okay.

04:34.682 --> 04:36.232
- I liked her.
- You did?

04:36.284 --> 04:37.901
- No, no.
- I didn't think so.

04:39.787 --> 04:41.821
Hey, remember that song, huh?

04:41.855 --> 04:43.156
- Sure, Bob.
- Yeah.

04:43.190 --> 04:44.357
- Do I remember that?
- That was the night.

04:44.375 --> 04:45.909
- Great night.
- Yeah.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.210
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm not talking about the concert.

04:47.244 --> 04:49.245
No, the after--
the afterparty.

04:49.297 --> 04:50.513
- The afterparty.
- The after-- yeah.

04:50.548 --> 04:54.000
Jess, no.

04:54.034 --> 04:56.035
Parent trap.

04:57.807 --> 05:00.424
Okay, admittedly this is
a little bit crazy,

05:00.458 --> 05:03.460
but if this is going to work,
you're both helping me.

05:03.478 --> 05:04.929
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Sit down, sit down.

05:04.963 --> 05:06.680
- I'm not doing a parent trap.
- Nick,

05:06.881 --> 05:08.949
they got married too young,
they got divorced too young.

05:08.967 --> 05:11.251
I think this could
really make them happy.

05:11.285 --> 05:13.087
They need us.
Here's the plan:

05:13.121 --> 05:14.454
We're gonna make
my mom look so hot

05:14.472 --> 05:16.140
that my dad can't resist her.

05:16.174 --> 05:18.408
Your parent trap--
there's no identical twins

05:18.409 --> 05:19.343
or mistaken identity?

05:19.394 --> 05:21.962
Not a parent trap,
it's a makeover.

05:21.980 --> 05:24.181
The only thing you have to do
is distract my dad.

05:24.232 --> 05:26.266
A parent trap takes
weeks of scheduling.

05:26.300 --> 05:27.968
I feel like you're just
throwing this together.

05:27.986 --> 05:29.186
This is a makeshift
parent trap;

05:29.237 --> 05:31.455
- They don't work.
- Why do you have to ruin everything, Nick?

05:31.489 --> 05:32.990
I don't know, I've
got something bad

05:33.024 --> 05:36.110
inside of me.
I ruin things.

05:36.144 --> 05:37.277
Let's do this parent trap.

05:37.311 --> 05:38.278
Yes.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.448
Oh, would you
look at that?

05:41.482 --> 05:43.667
She's spectacular.
Wow.

05:43.702 --> 05:45.552
Well, you know,
we used to date, right?

05:45.587 --> 05:46.820
You, Schmiggle?

05:46.838 --> 05:48.539
- Schmidt.
- Please.

05:48.590 --> 05:50.190
Cece, can you please
come over here

05:50.225 --> 05:52.042
and confirm our intercourse?

05:52.093 --> 05:54.661
And then I dumped her 'cause
I was like, you know, whatever.

05:54.679 --> 05:56.196
You mean, you ran away scared.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.665
Exactly, you're not enough man
for a woman like that.

05:58.683 --> 06:00.834
- Okay, yeah, and you are?
- Damn right I am.

06:00.852 --> 06:02.669
Well, I'll tell you what,
if you guys want to find out

06:02.687 --> 06:05.672
who's truly the manliest,
you should have a contest.

06:05.690 --> 06:07.458
- I'm listening.    - Go on.
- The winner

06:07.492 --> 06:11.344
of this contest will be
declared the one true Schmidt.

06:11.363 --> 06:13.480
- Yes.     - It is on.
- What are you doing?

06:13.514 --> 06:15.348
- I'm bored.
- Nice.

06:16.951 --> 06:18.702
Seems like every time
they want

06:18.737 --> 06:20.487
to move a team
to Los Angeles,

06:20.521 --> 06:22.489
the team that's most likely
to move here,

06:22.523 --> 06:23.857
the owner Al Davis...

06:23.875 --> 06:24.875
Dead.

06:24.909 --> 06:26.193
And then they talk to the,

06:26.211 --> 06:28.662
to the Ravens and their owner
Art Modell-- dead.

06:28.696 --> 06:30.363
Dead. You know what I mean?

06:30.382 --> 06:31.915
Who-Who's going
to speak out for us,

06:31.966 --> 06:33.550
- I mean, the voice of the NFL--
Steve Sabol?  Dead.

06:33.585 --> 06:35.386
- Also dead.
- Exactly.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.504
You know, it doesn't take
a genius. All you got to do is

06:37.538 --> 06:38.589
- follow the money.
- Always follow the money.

06:38.640 --> 06:39.606
That's what
I always say.

06:39.641 --> 06:40.758
- You always follow the money.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:40.809 --> 06:42.676
- Oil companies.
- Pharmaceuticals.

06:42.710 --> 06:45.763
Big business,
chicken corporations.

06:46.314 --> 06:47.731
Corn.

06:48.433 --> 06:50.150
Yeah.

06:55.556 --> 06:57.691
Just explain to me again
why we're doing this.

06:57.725 --> 07:00.560
Because, when Cece's
all washed up as a model,

07:00.578 --> 07:01.945
she wants to be
a makeup artist.

07:01.996 --> 07:04.198
And I want to help her
realize her dreams.

07:05.417 --> 07:06.900
Yeah, it's my plan B.

07:06.918 --> 07:09.620
Okay, stop.
Seriously, it's just too much.

07:09.671 --> 07:11.121
The makeup and-and your dress?

07:11.172 --> 07:13.073
The only reason I wear makeup
in Portland

07:13.091 --> 07:14.208
is to keep the rain off my face.

07:14.242 --> 07:18.762
So your hair just does,
like, this one thing, right?

07:19.297 --> 07:21.748
Sorry.

07:21.766 --> 07:23.416
I don't know if Jess
has told you this,

07:23.435 --> 07:24.802
but I am writing a novel.

07:24.853 --> 07:26.253
- Oh, really?     - Yeah.
- What's it about?

07:26.271 --> 07:27.554
It's about zombies.

07:27.588 --> 07:28.806
Zombies?

07:28.857 --> 07:30.057
And it's a relationship story.

07:30.091 --> 07:31.308
It has a great love story
in there

07:31.359 --> 07:32.810
that could be made into a movie,
I think.

07:32.861 --> 07:34.561
The love story's between... whom?

07:34.595 --> 07:35.946
The zombie and Carol.

07:35.980 --> 07:38.482
Zombie and the-the...
Carol is not a zombie?

07:38.533 --> 07:40.135
- She's a regular person?
- No, she's a rich girl.

07:40.233 --> 07:41.935
Oh, so it's like the <i>Twilight</i>
thing where...

07:41.953 --> 07:43.487
It's not like the <i>Twilight...</i>
No, it isn't.

07:43.538 --> 07:44.604
Where the vampire falls in love
with a regular person.

07:44.622 --> 07:46.273
You don't really...
you don't get it.

07:46.291 --> 07:47.991
- It's the same thing.
- Oh, really?

07:48.042 --> 07:49.293
Is there another guy
on <i>Twilight,</i>

07:49.327 --> 07:50.811
that there's a bit
of a love triangle with?

07:51.145 --> 07:52.429
Yes.

07:52.464 --> 07:55.249
- It's the same as <i>Twilight</i>...
- Does <i>Twilight</i> have a wolf in it?

07:55.283 --> 07:56.500
- Yes.
- It does?

07:56.551 --> 07:57.568
Yes.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.952
Is <i>Twilight</i> in Seattle?

07:59.470 --> 08:00.888
Yes!

08:02.140 --> 08:05.759
Well, then whoever wrote that
is smart.

08:05.793 --> 08:07.261
Um, listen,

08:07.295 --> 08:09.263
I know you were very young,

08:09.297 --> 08:11.131
and I'll completely forgive you,

08:11.149 --> 08:12.649
just tell me the truth--

08:13.084 --> 08:14.634
Did you drive my van?

08:14.652 --> 08:16.687
Joan, I have told you this.

08:17.438 --> 08:18.772
It wasn't me.

08:18.806 --> 08:20.807
Okay, I believe you.

08:21.475 --> 08:22.576
I know it was you.

08:24.312 --> 08:27.998
Wow, I look like
a slutty Katie Couric.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.168
The trap has been set.

08:31.202 --> 08:33.153
- Is is working?
- Mm-hmm.

08:33.171 --> 08:34.337
Croce makes my mom frisky.

08:34.371 --> 08:35.539
Check it out.

08:37.207 --> 08:38.325
Oh, hey, your mom
looks great.

08:38.342 --> 08:39.543
Really?

08:39.594 --> 08:41.611
- Go hit on her.
- What?

08:41.645 --> 08:42.996
My dad gets super jealous.

08:43.014 --> 08:44.831
So if you go lay some
sweet game on her...

08:44.849 --> 08:46.717
- Go hit on your mother?
- I was going to make Schmidt do it.

08:46.768 --> 08:48.168
No, no, no, I can't hit on...

08:48.186 --> 08:50.387
- Hey, Mom. Mom, uh,
- Jess...

08:50.438 --> 08:53.223
Nick was just saying
that your décolletage

08:53.274 --> 08:55.692
looks bewitching
in that dress.

08:55.727 --> 08:57.694
- Right, Nick?
- Thank you.

08:58.729 --> 09:00.513
I like your de, uh...

09:00.532 --> 09:03.483
your de... de-college.

09:03.517 --> 09:04.818
Say hello to my
sister wives,

09:04.852 --> 09:06.820
Mrs. Schmidt and
Mrs. Schmidt.

09:08.406 --> 09:10.490
- All right, time for delts?
- Oh, yeah?   - Yeah.

09:10.524 --> 09:12.376
I'm slowly regretting this.

09:12.410 --> 09:13.911
Definition
is for chicks, man.

09:13.962 --> 09:15.179
All right, it's
all about size.

09:15.213 --> 09:16.914
I mean, look at the
mass on this bitch.

09:16.965 --> 09:18.665
- Stupid.
- What's your calf situation like?

09:18.699 --> 09:20.551
Calves?
Want to see some ankle circles?

09:20.585 --> 09:22.052
Look at that.
Some donkey raises?

09:22.086 --> 09:23.921
One, two...

09:23.972 --> 09:25.039
No, no, no, no, no.
Wheelbarrow.

09:25.073 --> 09:26.557
- What's a wheelbarrow?
- Wheelbarrow.

09:26.608 --> 09:27.758
Every kid knows what
a wheelbarrow is.

09:27.759 --> 09:29.426
Put your hands
on the ground.

09:29.477 --> 09:30.894
Hand on the ground.

09:31.679 --> 09:33.180
Hey! All right.

09:33.214 --> 09:35.048
- Turn him around. Faster.
- Yeah, all right.

09:35.066 --> 09:36.500
Come on, man,
really work those calves.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.218
Look at this, Winston,
I can do this all day, man.

09:38.236 --> 09:39.719
No, I got it
all day, man.

09:39.737 --> 09:40.904
All day,
I don't even think about it.

09:40.939 --> 09:42.890
That's awesome.
Keep going.

09:42.924 --> 09:45.242
- All day. I can do this all day, Winston.
- I got all day, too!

09:45.326 --> 09:46.110
Hey, how long can you
do this for?

09:46.161 --> 09:47.445
I can do this all day!

09:47.496 --> 09:49.746
- Yeah, I got all day, too!
- Winston!

09:49.781 --> 09:50.731
Why are you yelling at me?

09:50.765 --> 09:52.082
I'll do this all day!

09:52.116 --> 09:53.617
I'll do it all day,
Winston!

09:53.668 --> 09:55.919
- This is great.
- I'll do it all day, Winston!

09:55.954 --> 09:57.804
Joan, I've got to say

09:57.839 --> 09:59.206
you are great...

09:59.240 --> 10:00.407
at doing what you're doing.

10:00.425 --> 10:02.259
You got those beautiful
strong arms.

10:02.293 --> 10:04.378
- You want to give
it a try? - Okay.

10:04.412 --> 10:08.131
Mom and Nick seem to be
really getting along great.

10:08.182 --> 10:09.916
- Well, no, no, no...
- Is that good?

10:09.934 --> 10:11.551
- You're wasting it.
- Oh, sorry, then show me.

10:11.585 --> 10:13.437
Mm, yeah.

10:13.471 --> 10:15.439
Yeah, we got to get
the whole thing.

10:15.473 --> 10:16.473
There you go.

10:16.524 --> 10:18.308
What is happening?

10:18.359 --> 10:20.444
I can feel the chemistry
from here.

10:20.478 --> 10:22.062
I sprayed all over.

10:22.096 --> 10:23.647
Clean up time.

10:23.698 --> 10:26.149
Like, whoa.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.485
Jess, what are you doing?

10:28.536 --> 10:29.653
Watching the game.

10:29.704 --> 10:31.104
You're doing the
parent trap thing again.

10:31.122 --> 10:32.623
- What? Dad...
- Yes.

10:32.657 --> 10:34.124
I have a master's degree.

10:34.158 --> 10:35.659
I'm not parent trapping.

10:35.710 --> 10:36.960
- You're such a liar.
- Seriously,

10:36.995 --> 10:38.462
I'm not... Okay.
Fine, you're right.

10:38.496 --> 10:40.447
- You need help.
- Why do I do that?

10:40.465 --> 10:43.333
I don't understand.
Every time, it never worked out.

10:43.384 --> 10:45.085
Okay, I'm calling
it off. Nick.

10:45.119 --> 10:47.337
♪ Every time I try
to tell you ♪

10:47.388 --> 10:49.122
♪ The words just
come out wrong ♪

10:49.140 --> 10:50.957
Nick!

10:50.975 --> 10:53.293
♪ So I have to
say "I love you" ♪

10:53.311 --> 10:54.794
♪ In a song.

10:54.812 --> 10:56.179
- Nick!
- I love that.

10:56.214 --> 10:57.514
Nick!
Thanks for helping me out,

10:57.565 --> 10:58.765
but I'm calling
it off.

10:58.799 --> 11:00.350
She's doing another one
of her parent traps.

11:00.401 --> 11:02.252
- Can I top you off?
- Yes, please.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.020
Hey, Nick,
what are you doing?

11:03.071 --> 11:04.354
I don't know, Jessica.

11:04.405 --> 11:05.805
I'm a little bit confused.

11:05.823 --> 11:06.974
I think I'm
into your mother.

11:07.008 --> 11:08.659
- What?!
- I don't know how it happened.

11:08.693 --> 11:10.143
In truth, it happens
all the time, Nick.

11:10.161 --> 11:12.529
I don't know if it's
the sweet sounds of Jimmy Croce

11:12.580 --> 11:14.448
or the sweet smells
of this turkey...

11:14.482 --> 11:15.999
Nick, this is not what
we talked about.

11:16.034 --> 11:18.452
- I know but it got...
- Give me that baster.

11:18.486 --> 11:21.154
- No!

11:21.172 --> 11:22.372
Okay, everyone.

11:22.423 --> 11:23.957
This bird needs to go
back in the oven.

11:23.991 --> 11:26.159
Bob, I need to clean you up
in the bathroom please.

11:26.177 --> 11:27.277
- Come on.
- Brand-new shirt.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.629
Do I regret it? Yes.

11:29.663 --> 11:32.332
Would I do it again?
Probably.

11:32.350 --> 11:33.666
It's all right, Joan,
you don't have to do it.

11:33.685 --> 11:35.385
You want, you can go
back to your basting.

11:35.436 --> 11:36.669
What, did you get
a little jealous, Bob?

11:36.688 --> 11:38.138
Of that idiot? What,
are you kidding me?

11:38.172 --> 11:41.191
You know, she's really
got to stop doing this.

11:41.225 --> 11:42.509
She's so stubborn.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.311
Wonder where she got that?

11:44.345 --> 11:46.846
Did she ever text you
some photos?

11:46.864 --> 11:48.681
- You mean of you in the shower?
- Yeah.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.684
- I got 'em.
- I was just wondering.

11:51.703 --> 11:55.872
Eh, maybe I was a
little jealous.

11:57.000 --> 12:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:18.613 --> 12:20.747
Seems to me like
this whole thing is a draw.

12:20.765 --> 12:24.050
I mean, You did touch a hotter pan,
but he ate a much bigger candle.

12:24.584 --> 12:27.470
You belched longer,
he farted louder.

12:27.521 --> 12:30.422
You punched a tree,
he head-butted a bench.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.591
You both bailed on
the fifth testicle punch.

12:32.610 --> 12:34.811
I mean, Schmidt,
how much more can you take?

12:34.862 --> 12:36.729
Schmiggle, I got the belts
rigged up in the bedroom.

12:36.763 --> 12:38.264
Ready to see
who blacks out first?

12:38.282 --> 12:39.399
All right, you know what,
forget it.

12:39.433 --> 12:40.633
Whatever, I-I give.

12:40.668 --> 12:42.935
- Yes! That's what I'm talking about.
- Wow.

12:42.953 --> 12:45.154
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

12:47.324 --> 12:49.408
Yeah, but know this, all right.

12:49.442 --> 12:51.460
Your caveman ideas about manhood
are so over.

12:51.495 --> 12:53.779
Manhood today is
about exfoliation,

12:53.797 --> 12:55.247
- Ha!
- And cheese courses,

12:55.281 --> 12:58.184
and emotional honesty,
and Paxil.

12:58.218 --> 13:00.786
And yes, cutting peppers in the
classic <i>style de julienne.</i>

13:00.804 --> 13:04.573
You may have bested me in a
competition of pre-Clinton manhood,

13:04.608 --> 13:06.425
but I am Schmidt.

13:06.459 --> 13:09.011
A refined and enlightened
pescetarian.

13:09.062 --> 13:10.679
About 90% of the time.

13:10.730 --> 13:13.849
Observe.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.901
What are you doing?

13:24.477 --> 13:28.031
Don't touch the blade--
it's hot.

13:28.582 --> 13:29.499
A classic julienne.

13:29.533 --> 13:31.801
Marine Corps
Cook of the Year 2003.

13:33.337 --> 13:35.271
And I can do the same thing
to a man's arm.

13:35.305 --> 13:36.673
Yeah, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding.

13:36.707 --> 13:38.324
That's the sound
of round two.

13:39.876 --> 13:41.344
Perfection.

13:41.378 --> 13:43.212
This is a masterpiece
right here.

13:43.263 --> 13:44.714
- Who's hungry, right?
- I am starving.

13:44.765 --> 13:46.632
Well, it makes sense
with you two.

13:46.666 --> 13:47.800
You guys must've
worked up an appetite.

13:48.334 --> 13:48.951
What?

13:50.437 --> 13:51.637
Look at that plating.

13:51.671 --> 13:52.972
It's like Picasso.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.974
It's nice squeeze bottle
work there, Bobby Flay.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.193
- He is still relevant.
- Where? Phoenix?

13:57.227 --> 13:59.312
Schmidt, come on,
we are getting hungry.

13:59.346 --> 14:00.430
What don't you guys
just stay here?

14:00.464 --> 14:02.231
- I'll sleep on the couch.
- What? What are you saying?

14:02.282 --> 14:03.566
- What?
- Nothing happened.

14:03.617 --> 14:05.535
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

14:05.569 --> 14:07.303
- I'm with you.
- You shouldn't be saying anything...

14:07.337 --> 14:08.854
- Anything,
- 'cause I don't know anything.

14:08.872 --> 14:10.323
'Cause you're not... you
don't have any information

14:10.357 --> 14:11.524
- about anything.
- Information at all.

14:11.542 --> 14:12.558
Nothing.

14:12.593 --> 14:14.693
- Happened.
- The answer is nothing.

14:14.712 --> 14:15.895
- What?
- Answer me a question.

14:15.929 --> 14:17.863
Which one of these platings
is more masculine?

14:17.881 --> 14:20.266
Look, do you guys want to know
what the ultimate test is?

14:20.300 --> 14:22.435
Being secure in
your masculinity.

14:22.469 --> 14:23.886
- How do we prove that?
- I'm super secure.

14:23.921 --> 14:24.870
You kiss a man.

14:25.688 --> 14:26.723
Yeah.

14:26.757 --> 14:29.041
If you want to be
the one true Schmidt. I mean...

14:29.059 --> 14:30.376
- No. We don't.
- I'll kiss a man.

14:30.394 --> 14:31.594
I'll kiss a man.
Yeah, I'll kiss a man.

14:31.645 --> 14:34.247
- Winston. Yeah, he'd do.
- Winston?

14:34.281 --> 14:36.215
I could go for some stuffing
right now. Am I right?

14:36.233 --> 14:38.067
- Yeah, love me some stuffing.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:38.102 --> 14:40.069
- Yeah, right? - Yeah, let's go.
- I'll kiss Winston.

14:40.104 --> 14:41.187
- I'll do it.
- I'll kiss Winston all day.

14:41.221 --> 14:42.255
I'll kiss Winston's mouth

14:42.289 --> 14:43.106
all day.

14:43.157 --> 14:44.040
Let's do it.

14:44.074 --> 14:45.024
All day
I'll kiss Winston...

14:45.058 --> 14:45.942
Everybody else
really hot, too?

14:45.993 --> 14:48.194
- Oh, wow.
- Hey. Ooh!

14:48.228 --> 14:48.911
Thank you.

14:48.946 --> 14:50.446
- Manly.
- Beautiful.

14:50.497 --> 14:51.948
Hey, Winston, uh, I got you this

14:51.999 --> 14:53.699
as an after-dinner
mint for after dinner.

14:53.733 --> 14:55.734
- Oh, thanks, man. I appreciate it.
- Okay? For you to have.

14:55.753 --> 14:57.236
- I appreciate that.
- Just make sure you take... that's right...

14:57.254 --> 14:58.221
What are we having
here, turkey sushi?

14:58.255 --> 14:59.705
What is this?

14:59.739 --> 15:01.557
Ooh.

15:01.592 --> 15:03.760
I'm gonna make a toast.

15:05.412 --> 15:08.598
<i>Parent Trap's</i> just a movie.

15:08.632 --> 15:11.434
And real relationships
are not like that.

15:11.468 --> 15:12.935
They're more complicated
than that.

15:14.071 --> 15:15.388
And they're not even real twins.

15:15.422 --> 15:17.273
Twins! Yes!

15:17.307 --> 15:19.292
I'm thankful for twins.
They're like sisters,

15:19.326 --> 15:21.060
but they do it, and
they like to have sex.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.945
- Schmidts.
- What?!

15:22.980 --> 15:25.047
- What?
- In conclusion...

15:26.533 --> 15:28.818
I want to say
what I'm thankful for.

15:29.369 --> 15:32.604
Family.

15:32.622 --> 15:36.775
They said...
it couldn't be done.

15:36.794 --> 15:38.077
They said,

15:38.111 --> 15:39.846
"You're crazy, Jess."

15:39.880 --> 15:43.815
I am so thankful today
that I proved them wrong.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.802
- Whoa, honey, what?
- Whoa, hey, hey, wait. What are you saying?

15:45.836 --> 15:47.837
Congratulations, guys.
We saw you guys doing it

15:47.888 --> 15:49.305
- in the bathroom.
- No, no, no, no, no.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.123
- We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.
- It was the greatest day

15:51.141 --> 15:53.125
- of my entire life.
- Greatest day of mine.

15:53.143 --> 15:54.793
There was so much love there.

15:54.812 --> 15:56.596
And sex. Sex energy,
too, Jess.

15:56.630 --> 15:57.647
And se-sex.

15:57.681 --> 15:59.432
You lit this place on fire,

15:59.466 --> 16:01.317
- you two animals.
- It was just a kiss.

16:01.351 --> 16:02.435
It was a <i>great</i> kiss.

16:02.469 --> 16:04.086
It was a hookup.
It mean nothing.

16:04.121 --> 16:05.271
Listen, if
Joanie's up for grabs,

16:05.305 --> 16:07.173
- I volunteer.
- I volunteer, too.

16:07.207 --> 16:08.591
- I volunteered first.
- Don't even matter.

16:08.625 --> 16:10.459
- You can't volunteer right after...
- I'm in the game now.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.195
You just wanted
me for my body.

16:12.229 --> 16:14.297
- Yup.
- And I'm fine with that.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.132
- Joanie, what if it was like that?
- That's not bad.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.434
I saw something. You guys had
a spark, you connected.

16:18.468 --> 16:20.036
Let's get natural.
Bring it to you.

16:20.087 --> 16:21.537
I swear, if you
got together today,

16:21.572 --> 16:22.988
it would be different
than before.

16:23.006 --> 16:24.207
I think you could
make each other happy.

16:24.258 --> 16:25.658
I'm serious. No. What?
Let me finish.

16:25.676 --> 16:27.043
Jess, you got to
let it go, okay?

16:27.094 --> 16:28.494
No, I'm not letting it go!

16:28.512 --> 16:29.846
- You have to admit that...
- No.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.163
- What? ...
- they're never gonna make it work.

16:31.181 --> 16:33.015
- No.
- And you scratched my van.

16:33.050 --> 16:34.851
Mom, she didn't mean
to scratch your van.

16:34.885 --> 16:36.135
I knew it. I knew it.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.637
Didn't I tell you? I knew it.

16:37.671 --> 16:39.639
Okay, the reason
I was in your van

16:39.673 --> 16:42.058
is because your little
JuJuBe was high as a kite!

16:42.109 --> 16:43.809
Oh. Oh, my God.

16:43.843 --> 16:45.528
Honey, are you an addict?
Oh, this is new information.

16:45.562 --> 16:48.147
It was a brownie. I wasn't
allowed to eat chocolate.

16:48.181 --> 16:49.014
Yes. What, are you
living with drug dealers?

16:49.867 --> 16:52.518
When can we start eating?

16:52.536 --> 16:54.370
- Are you into pot? Is this a rehab?
- What are you doing?

16:54.404 --> 16:55.922
Are you selling your
body to pay for the rent?

16:55.956 --> 16:57.490
I don't sell my body
for rent, no!

16:59.793 --> 17:02.395
When can we start eating?

17:02.429 --> 17:04.195
It's off. Off.

17:04.214 --> 17:05.998
Shut up, everybody!

17:10.301 --> 17:12.672
I just want to be a family.

17:12.705 --> 17:15.074
Jess.

17:15.108 --> 17:16.559
You have a family.

17:17.944 --> 17:20.061
Your father and I are not
getting back together.

17:21.097 --> 17:22.080
Never.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.213
Jess.

17:39.666 --> 17:40.750
- Honey?
- Where you going?

17:40.784 --> 17:41.400
Jess?

17:42.902 --> 17:43.653
Turkey.

18:00.218 --> 18:03.603
Jess. Honey,
can I come in?

18:03.637 --> 18:06.272
Or do you have your
dad hiding in the closet,

18:06.306 --> 18:08.024
waiting to make
out with me?

18:14.164 --> 18:16.499
I'm sorry.

18:16.533 --> 18:18.684
I'm sorry. I ruined
the whole day,

18:18.719 --> 18:21.154
and it could have been
really nice, but it wasn't,

18:21.188 --> 18:23.873
'cause I tried to shove a turkey
down a garbage disposal.

18:23.924 --> 18:26.509
I just...

18:26.543 --> 18:28.994
I thought...

18:29.012 --> 18:32.014
maybe you guys could
make each other happy.

18:32.049 --> 18:34.884
We're actually
happier apart.

18:34.935 --> 18:37.670
Maybe I just worried that...

18:37.688 --> 18:39.189
since you guys are alone

18:39.223 --> 18:41.491
that means that I have
to end up alone.

18:41.525 --> 18:42.976
You're not
gonna be alone.

18:43.010 --> 18:44.361
Even if you were,

18:44.395 --> 18:46.146
you could always
move in with me.

18:46.180 --> 18:48.398
We could get a
condo in Miami.

18:48.449 --> 18:50.183
Mm.

18:50.201 --> 18:52.485
And start solving
crimes together.

18:52.519 --> 18:54.237
God, you have to
lighten up, Jess.

18:54.288 --> 18:56.906
It's just life.

18:56.957 --> 18:58.575
Yeah, you know what?

18:58.626 --> 19:00.076
We could definitely
<i>Grey Gardens</i>

19:00.127 --> 19:03.163
the crap out of a condo in Miami.

19:03.197 --> 19:05.665
Can't wait to eat cat food with you.

19:07.968 --> 19:09.869
I'm okay. Don't
worry about me.

19:10.887 --> 19:12.054
And so is your dad.

19:12.089 --> 19:13.406
Okay.

19:13.441 --> 19:14.841
We doing this or not?

19:15.875 --> 19:17.260
I'm going in.

19:20.380 --> 19:21.933
Mmm. Mmm.

19:24.518 --> 19:26.152
- What's up, bro?
- What's up?

19:27.071 --> 19:28.271
No.

19:28.322 --> 19:29.722
Face smells like
a dude's face.

19:29.740 --> 19:31.191
- Not for me.
- Hmm.

19:31.225 --> 19:32.892
All right.

19:33.310 --> 19:35.328
Watch how a real
man does it.

19:41.285 --> 19:43.036
Hey, Winston?

19:46.070 --> 19:46.706
'Sup?

19:46.740 --> 19:48.425
- Yeah.
- I know, right?

19:48.459 --> 19:49.876
Yeah.

19:49.910 --> 19:51.344
Hmm.

19:53.431 --> 19:54.714
Okay, well, then it's off.

19:54.748 --> 19:56.082
Game over.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.551
No. No way.

19:58.586 --> 19:59.386
- Winston?
- Hmm?

19:59.420 --> 20:01.221
All day!

20:02.823 --> 20:03.923
Whoa!

20:03.941 --> 20:04.757
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

20:04.775 --> 20:05.608
I did it.

20:05.643 --> 20:07.427
And I'm the one
true Schmidt!

20:07.445 --> 20:09.229
You got it, man.
You can be Schmidt. I'm...

20:09.263 --> 20:10.930
You should not
do that on Thanksgiving.

20:10.948 --> 20:13.366
I kissed a dude!

20:17.180 --> 20:19.706
Oh, I miss Krista.

20:26.629 --> 20:28.748
You know, she had
a little mustache, too?

20:28.782 --> 20:31.301
I know she did.

20:31.335 --> 20:34.304
You okay... Schmidt?

20:35.638 --> 20:37.290
Yes... I am...

20:38.558 --> 20:39.743
Schmidt.

20:41.777 --> 20:43.597
Happy Thanksgiving.

20:44.131 --> 20:46.132
Give me a hug.
I love you, sweetie.

20:46.150 --> 20:46.766
Love you.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.934
Love you, sweetheart.

20:47.968 --> 20:49.853
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you, too, sweetheart.

20:49.904 --> 20:51.821
Joan, I just want to say that

20:51.856 --> 20:54.473
I'm really happy that, you know,
we got past all that.

20:54.665 --> 20:56.699
Come here, Cece.

20:56.717 --> 21:00.920
Give my little girl
drugs again-- I will end you.

21:00.988 --> 21:01.887
Bye.

21:01.955 --> 21:03.023
Bye, everybody.

21:03.091 --> 21:04.424
- And no more parent traps.
- Okay.

21:04.492 --> 21:05.958
Yeah. We're done with those.

21:06.026 --> 21:07.493
- Got it.
- Been there, trapped that.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.762
- Bye.
- Love you guys. Bye.

21:22.692 --> 21:24.893
I won't tell her if you don't.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.595
Tell her about what?
