WEBVTT

00:21.521 --> 00:23.565
Officer: DETECTIVES.

00:23.648 --> 00:26.609
THIS WOMAN
SAW SOMETHING.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.529
ALL RIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU
COVER THIS BODY UP.

00:31.531 --> 00:32.949
HOW ARE YOU, MA'AM?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.200
I'M DETECTIVE SIMONE.
THIS IS DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.368
BERNICE JOHNSON.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.871
I WAS ON MY WAY INSIDE,

00:37.912 --> 00:40.373
AND I HEARD
THE BOY LAND.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.792
IT WAS SUCH
A HORRIBLE SOUND.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.211
I HEARD SCREAMING FIRST
FROM ABOVE

00:45.295 --> 00:47.380
AND THEN,
A FEW SECONDS LATER,

00:47.422 --> 00:49.174
THAT HORRIBLE SOUND--

00:49.215 --> 00:50.800
LIKE A PUMPKIN EXPLODING.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.302
I KNOW THE SOUND

00:52.385 --> 00:55.388
'CAUSE A PUMPKIN
FELL OFF MY SILL
LAST HALLOWEEN.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.266
MA'AM, BY CHANCE,
DID YOU HAPPEN
TO LOOK UP

00:58.349 --> 01:00.268
AND SEE ANYONE
UP THERE ON THE ROOF

01:00.351 --> 01:01.770
AFTER THE BOY FELL?

01:01.853 --> 01:03.063
YES, I DID.

01:03.104 --> 01:04.397
I MADE MYSELF GO OUT,

01:04.439 --> 01:07.192
AND I SAW 2 BOYS
LOOKING DOWN.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.526
AND THEN THEY WENT OFF.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.612
WERE YOU ABLE TO SEE
WHAT THE BOYS
LOOKED LIKE?

01:10.695 --> 01:11.654
BLACK.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.032
I KNOW IT MIGHT HAVE
BEEN DIFFICULT,

01:14.074 --> 01:16.076
BUT COULD YOU TELL IF
THEY WERE LIGHT-SKINNED
OR DARK-SKINNED,

01:16.117 --> 01:17.410
ANYTHING THAT
COULD HELP US
WITH IDENTIFICATION?

01:17.494 --> 01:18.953
OH, I COULDN'T
HELP YOU WITH THAT.

01:19.037 --> 01:22.082
I WAS SO CAUGHT UP
WITH THAT DEAD BOY.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.917
AND THAT SOUND.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.001
WELL, THANKS
FOR YOUR HELP.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.088
HE WAS PROBABLY
BUYING DRUGS.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.422
THAT'S WHAT THEY
COME UP HERE FOR.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.800
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
APPRECIATE IT.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.637
WE GOT WHAT LOOKS LIKE
THE D.O.A.'S CLOTHES,

01:35.720 --> 01:37.347
AND GREG FOUND
A WALLET AND I.D.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.932
STUFFED IN A DRAINPIPE.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.892
Greg: WILLIAM
WEAVER, JR. 18.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.102
RIVERHEAD ADDRESS.

01:42.143 --> 01:43.770
HE'S WAY OUT
OF HIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.271
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, JILL.

01:45.313 --> 01:48.066
CAR'S REGISTERED TO
A WILLIAM WEAVER, SR.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.902
THAT'S WILLIAM, JR.

01:50.944 --> 01:51.986
ANDY.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.656
GOT AN I.D.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.491
THIS KID'S OUT
OF RIVERHEAD.

01:56.574 --> 01:57.992
OLD LADY'S
PROBABLY RIGHT.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.245
KID CAME HERE
FOR DRUGS.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.538
I DON'T KNOW.

02:01.621 --> 02:02.580
HE HAD
A D.A.R.E. STICKER
ON THE CAR'S BUMPER.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.165
WHAT'D THIS GUY SAY?

02:04.249 --> 02:06.167
HE LOOKED
OUT HIS WINDOW

02:06.251 --> 02:07.502
AFTER HEARING
THE BODY LAND.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.045
ABOUT A MINUTE LATER,

02:09.129 --> 02:11.548
HE SAW ANOTHER
YOUNG WHITE GUY
BOLT FROM THE BUILDING.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.300
THAT WOULD MAKE HIM
ANOTHER PARTICIPANT
IN OUR PUMPKIN TOSS.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.468
WHAT?

02:15.510 --> 02:17.011
I'LL TELL YOU LATER.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.141
WHAT'D YOU GET?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.393
D.O.A.'S AN 18-YEAR-OLD KID
FROM RIVERHEAD.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.270
FATHER RUNS
A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.730
HE'S ON HIS WAY IN.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.190
D.O.A. AND ANOTHER WHITE KID
WERE ON THE ROOF

03:52.273 --> 03:54.275
WITH 2 NEIGHBORHOOD
BLACK KIDS.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.860
THIS A DRUG DEAL?

03:55.944 --> 03:57.320
YEAH. AFTER
A COUPLE OF MINUTES,

03:57.403 --> 03:58.404
THE NEIGHBORS
HEAR SCREAMING,

03:58.446 --> 03:59.822
D.O.A. HITS
THE SIDEWALK.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.824
EYEWITNESSES RECALLED
A DISTINCTIVE SPLAT.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.701
BLACK KIDS ARE WATCHING
FROM THE ROOF.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.079
THE OTHER WHITE KID,
HE TEAR-ASSES OUT
OF THE BUILDING.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.915
OK. YOU AND ANDY
STAY ON THIS.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.959
PROBABLY WANT
TO GET A UNIFORM
SWEEPING THE DEALERS.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.919

04:15.463 --> 04:16.589
WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:16.631 --> 04:18.258
I FEEL LIKE
I'M GETTING A BUG.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.260
OH, YEAH. THERE'S
A ROUGH ONE GOING AROUND.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.262
YOU WANNA LIE DOWN
IN THE CRIB
FOR A WHILE, DIANE?

04:22.303 --> 04:25.390
NO. I WANNA GO HOME,
TAKE A FEW HOURS
LOST TIME.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.558

04:27.642 --> 04:29.602
YEAH. HERE WE GO.

04:29.644 --> 04:30.812

04:30.853 --> 04:31.980

04:33.481 --> 04:35.525
HEY. WHAT BROUGHT
THIS ON?

04:35.608 --> 04:37.443

04:37.485 --> 04:38.736
I'M OK, BOBBY.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.071
I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.

04:40.154 --> 04:41.239
NO. DON'T DRIVE ME.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.657
LET ME GIVE YOU A CALL
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.158
LET ME CALL YOU, OK?

04:44.242 --> 04:46.661
JUST IN CASE I'VE
GOT MY EYES CLOSED.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.792
YOU BELIEVE
IN THAT ZINC?

04:52.834 --> 04:54.294
FOR COLD PREVENTION?

04:54.335 --> 04:57.338
NO. AS A MINING
OPPORTUNITY.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.758
THIS IS GONNA BE
THE D.O.A.'S FATHER.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.094
DOES HE KNOW YET?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.015
EXCUSE ME. ANY OF YOU
SIMONE? DETECTIVE SIMONE?

05:07.098 --> 05:08.516
I'M SIMONE.
MR. WEAVER?

05:08.599 --> 05:10.018
YEAH. WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH MY SON?

05:10.101 --> 05:11.352
THIS IS MY PARTNER
ANDY SIPOWICZ.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.562
HOW'S IT GOING?

05:12.603 --> 05:14.772

05:14.814 --> 05:17.817
AND I GOT 50 GUYS

05:17.900 --> 05:19.569
PICKING THEIR ASS
TILL I FIND OUT.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.654
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT
IN HERE.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.418
DON'T OFFER ME
NO COFFEE.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.046
NO SIT DOWN.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.715
JUST TELL ME THE JACKPOT
BILLY'S IN.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.927
WELL, COULD YOU HELP US
WHY YOUR SON

05:44.969 --> 05:47.764
WAS DOWN FROM RIVERHEAD
ON AVENUE C HERE,
MR. WILLIAMS.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.182

WHAT HIS SITUATION IS.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.767
WE'LL GET
TO YOUR QUESTION.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.685
HE AIN'T GOT NO BUSINESS
DOWN AVENUE C.

05:52.769 --> 05:53.811
YOUR BOY USE DRUGS?

05:53.853 --> 05:55.813
HE'S PICKED UP
FOR DRUGS?

05:55.855 --> 05:58.983
WE RECOGNIZE
YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE,

05:59.025 --> 06:00.318
BUT WE NEED TO DO THIS
HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.944
DOES HE HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH DRUGS?

06:01.986 --> 06:04.447
THE ELEMENT THESE KIDS
ARE EXPOSED TO TODAY,

06:04.489 --> 06:07.533
YOU TELL ME A KID HASN'T
HAD DRUG EXPERIENCE.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.453
BUT IF BILLY WAS PICKED UP
FOR SOME SERIOUS-TYPE
INFRACTION,

06:10.495 --> 06:12.121
SOME FRIEND OF HIS
LEFT HIM HOLDING THE BAG.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.706
BILLY'S NO DRUG ORGANIZER.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.167
YOU GOT ANY SPECIFIC
FRIEND OF YOUR BOY'S
IN MIND?

06:16.250 --> 06:18.669
I'M THROUGH TALKING
UNTIL I GET SOME ANSWERS.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.088
MR. WEAVER,

06:20.171 --> 06:21.631
YOUR SON WAS INVOLVED
IN AN ALTERCATION
THIS MORNING

06:21.672 --> 06:23.132
ON AVENUE C.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.426

WAS HIS FRIEND

06:25.510 --> 06:26.469
AND 2 OTHER
NEIGHBORHOOD GUYS

06:26.511 --> 06:28.471

ARE DRUG DEALERS.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.724
OH, SO 2 SMOKES

AND A FRIEND OF HIS

06:31.808 --> 06:34.018

06:34.060 --> 06:35.686
WE GOT IT, BOSS.

06:35.728 --> 06:39.023
MR. WEAVER, YOUR SON
WAS HURT IN THAT FIGHT.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.025
HIS INJURIES WERE FATAL.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.318
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

06:42.360 --> 06:43.528
HE WAS THROWN
OFF A ROOF.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.029
HE DIDN'T SURVIVE IT.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.323
YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
MY SON IS DEAD?

06:47.365 --> 06:49.200
WE'RE SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.701
WHY DON'T YOU
SIT DOWN.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.078
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO TELL ME?

06:52.161 --> 06:53.538
HERE.
DRINK THIS.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.415
SOMEBODY THREW BILLY
OFF A ROOF?

06:55.498 --> 06:57.041
WHO WAS BILLY
DOWN THERE WITH?

06:57.083 --> 06:58.543
ARE YOU
TRYING TO TELL ME

06:58.584 --> 06:59.752
I DIDN'T MOVE
FAR ENOUGH AWAY,

06:59.836 --> 07:02.046
AND I COULDN'T
PROTECT MY FAMILY

07:02.088 --> 07:04.715
AND THOSE BLACK
SONS OF BITCHES
TOOK HIS LIFE?

07:04.757 --> 07:05.716
RELAX NOW.

07:05.758 --> 07:07.552
THESE BLACK BASTARDS!

07:07.593 --> 07:09.053
ALL RIGHT,

07:09.095 --> 07:10.555
WHERE ARE
THESE NIGGERS?

07:10.596 --> 07:12.014
I WANNA SEE THEM!

07:12.056 --> 07:14.809
I WANNA SEE
WHO KILLED MY BOY!

07:14.892 --> 07:16.853
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

07:16.894 --> 07:19.063
UH-UH. I AIN'T
TALKING TO ONE NOW.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.523
ONE WHAT?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.775
WERE YOU ONE OF THOSE MONKEYS
JUMPING UP AND DOWN

07:22.859 --> 07:23.901
AFTER SIMPSON WAS FREE?

07:23.985 --> 07:25.778
GET HIM OUTTA HERE, ANDY.
GET HIM OUT!

07:25.862 --> 07:27.738
HE'S GETTING HIM
OUTTA HERE.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.200
THE KID'S FATHER.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.452
WHAT?

07:32.535 --> 07:35.121
I'M JUST SAYING,
WE MAY NEED HIM
LATER ON.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.039
WE DON'T NEED NOTHING
THAT BAD.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.691
DETECTIVE, THIS
IS THE DEAD BOY'S
PROPERTY VOUCHER.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.319
MAXINE, JUST PUT IT
ON THE DESK HERE.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.395
WHAT DO WE GOT?

08:41.479 --> 08:42.647
FEMALE D.O.A.--

08:42.730 --> 08:44.440
CUT UP AND STUFFED
IN THE FRIDGE.

08:44.482 --> 08:47.151
GOT AN AFRICAN NAME.
MULU KEBEDE.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.653
THE SON FOUND HER.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.112
WHERE IS HE?

08:50.154 --> 08:52.823
HE'S IN THE BEDROOM.
THE BABY-SITTER'S
IN THERE, TOO.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.325
HE CALLED HER, AND
SHE CALLED IT IN.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.998
OH!

09:01.040 --> 09:02.792
CAN I BORROW
YOUR FLASHLIGHT?

09:02.833 --> 09:03.876
YEAH.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.005
HOW OLD'S THE SON?

09:08.089 --> 09:10.174
12. HIS NAME'S EDDY.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.801
12-YEAR-OLD BOY
FOUND THIS.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.304
IS THERE A FATHER
IN THE PICTURE?

09:15.346 --> 09:17.181
HE'S IN THE WIND.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.725
LIGATURE MARKS.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.227
STRANGLED,
THEN DISMEMBERED.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.729
WOULDN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.277
NO FORCED ENTRY
OR RANSACKING?

09:29.360 --> 09:30.695
NO. NOTHING.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.492
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

09:40.162 --> 09:42.164
DETECTIVE MEDAVOY

09:42.206 --> 09:43.624
AND DETECTIVE
KIRKENDALL.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.585
LET'S GO OUT THERE.

09:53.384 --> 09:54.844
I'M MARIE FRANCIS.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.846
I BABY-SIT FOR EDDIE.
HE'S REAL SHOOK UP.

09:56.887 --> 09:59.849
MAYBE YOU COULD TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED
THIS MORNING.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.892
EDDIE
CALLED ME AROUND 10:00,

10:01.976 --> 10:04.103
CRYING AND BEGGING FOR ME
TO COME OVER.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.147
I FOUND HIM
CURLED ON THE BED.

10:06.230 --> 10:09.191
HE SAID,
"LOOK IN THE FRIDGE."

10:09.233 --> 10:10.818
WAS IT NORMAL, THE BOY
BEING HOME FROM SCHOOL?

10:10.901 --> 10:13.404
HE SAID HE FORGOT
SOME HOMEWORK.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.114
THE TEACHER
LET HIM COME HOME.

10:15.197 --> 10:18.034
HE WAS JUST GETTING
SOME ORANGE JUICE
BEFORE GOING BACK.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.285
DOES EDDY'S FATHER
WORK,

10:19.368 --> 10:20.453
OR SHOULD HE
BE HERE?

10:20.536 --> 10:21.954
HE'D BE WORKING,

10:22.038 --> 10:24.165
BUT YOU THINK
IT WAS HIM, HUH?

10:24.248 --> 10:26.083
WE'LL BE LOOKING
AT EVERY ANGLE.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.628
BUT WOULD YOU HAVE
SOME SUSPICION
IN THAT REGARD?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.880
THEY FOUGHT
AN AWFUL LOT LATELY,

10:30.921 --> 10:32.048
HIM AND HIS WIFE.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.215
ABOUT ANYTHING
IN PARTICULAR?

10:33.257 --> 10:34.675
IT WAS IN THEIR LANGUAGE.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.218
WOULD IT GET VIOLENT?

10:36.260 --> 10:37.720
NOT AROUND ME,

10:37.762 --> 10:40.348
BUT I DID SEE HER
WITH BRUISES.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.475
ANY IDEA WHERE
MR. KEBEDE MIGHT BE,

10:42.558 --> 10:44.018
HIS PLACE OF WORK?

10:44.101 --> 10:46.479
HE WORKED A LOT
OF DIFFERENT PLACES,

10:46.562 --> 10:49.482
BUT HE DOES HAVE
A SISTER HERE.

10:49.565 --> 10:53.402
H-I-R-U-U-T...

10:53.444 --> 10:54.403
KEBEDE.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.113
HIRUUT.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.740
HER NUMBER AND ADDRESS

10:57.782 --> 11:00.660
ARE IN A DRAWER
BY THE FRIDGE.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.662
WE CAN GET THAT
OURSELVES.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.080
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP,
MS. FRANCIS.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.831
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO EDDIE?

11:05.915 --> 11:08.709
WELL, IT DEPENDS IF
HIS FATHER'S INVOLVED.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.671
WOULD YOU MIND STAYING
WITH HIM FOR A WHILE

11:11.754 --> 11:13.881
TILL WE CONTACT HIS SISTER
OR SOCIAL SERVICES?

11:13.964 --> 11:15.257
NO, NOT AT ALL.

11:15.299 --> 11:18.928
IT'D BE A SHAME
IF HE WENT
TO HIRUUT.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.222
SHE DOESN'T
LIKE EDDIE
VERY MUCH.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.867
THAT ZINC'S
ALL OVER THE NEWS,

11:41.951 --> 11:43.786
IF THAT HELPS RUSSELL
OR WHAT.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.961
IT'S A THROAT LOZENGE.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.087
LIKE CANDY.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.005
YEAH, YOU SUCK THEM
LIKE CANDY.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.841
I DON'T KNOW IF
IT'S A CON OR WHAT.

11:58.676 --> 11:59.802
THANKS, ANDY.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.977
YOU BELIEVE THE MOUTH
ON THAT WEAVER?

12:08.018 --> 12:10.688
I DIDN'T THINK THE BOSS
WAS GONNA STOP.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.607
WHAT GOES THROUGH
PEOPLE'S MINDS?

12:13.691 --> 12:15.359
WHO?

12:15.401 --> 12:16.944
WEAVER.

12:17.027 --> 12:19.321
YOU CAN'T SPEAK
IN THAT FASHION.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.742
THEY'RE BRINGING
A DEALER UPSTAIRS
YOU WANT TO TALK TO.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.869
PICKED UP DIRTY ON AVENUE C.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.954
WE LIKE HIM
FOR BEING ON THE ROOF?

12:27.037 --> 12:29.498
SUPPOSEDLY THE D.O.A. WAS
TRADING GUNS FOR DRUGS.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.459
THIS DRUG DEALER WAS
CARRYING A PIECE

12:31.542 --> 12:33.711
F.A.T.N. TRACED TO A
GUN STORE ROBBERY IN BELLPORT.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.422
D.O.A.'S FROM RIVERHEAD.
BELLPORT'S NOT THAT FAR.

12:36.505 --> 12:37.423
THAT'S THE POINT.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.050
EXCUSE MY TARDY UPTAKE.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.261
Officer: MICHAEL REED.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.138
INTERVIEW 3. THANKS.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.557
COME ON, LET'S GO.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.185
BE NICE IF THIS ONE
HAD A RUNNING BUDDY.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.353
'CAUSE THERE WERE
2 DEALERS ON THE ROOF?

12:51.395 --> 12:52.897
THAT WOULD
BE THE POINT, YES.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.072
WRONG TIME TO BE
BREAKING FANCY'S SHOES.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.241
THAT WAS EQUIVALENT
SHOE-BREAKING.

13:22.259 --> 13:24.512
MICHAEL REED.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.139
WHERE'D YOU GET
THE GUN, MICHAEL?

13:27.181 --> 13:28.516
I JUST GOT IT,
YOU KNOW?

13:28.599 --> 13:30.392
OK. THEN WE'RE DONE.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.852
I CAN GO?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.354
SURE. GET UP.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.980
GIVE HIM A BETTER ANGLE

13:35.022 --> 13:36.065
TO SMACK YOU IN THE BACK
OF THE HEAD.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.441
WHERE WERE YOU
THIS MORNING?

13:37.483 --> 13:38.818
DOING BUSINESS.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.027
WHERE WERE YOU?

13:40.110 --> 13:41.487
ALPHABET CITY.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.364
ALPHABET CITY.
THAT'S WHERE YOU
GOT THE GUN FROM?

13:43.447 --> 13:45.115
NAH. I GOT THAT
IN VIETNAM.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.117
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.996
SEE, MICHAEL, MY PARTNER
DOESN'T FIND THAT FUNNY,

13:51.080 --> 13:52.957
AND A BALL-BREAKING
ATTITUDE ON YOUR PART

13:52.998 --> 13:54.500
IS A POOR CHOICE ANYWAY,

13:54.542 --> 13:56.502
'CAUSE YOU ARE LOOKING
REAL GOOD FOR A HOMICIDE
RIGHT NOW.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.128
YO, I DIDN'T DO
NO HOMICIDE.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.339
YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT KID
THAT WENT OFF THE ROOF
ON AVENUE C?

14:00.381 --> 14:01.841
HEARD ABOUT IT.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.092
NO. WE THINK YOU GOT
A CLOSER CONNECTION

14:03.175 --> 14:04.510
THAN JUST HEARING
ABOUT IT, MICHAEL.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.512
THAT GUN
THAT YOU ARE HOLDING

14:06.554 --> 14:07.847
BELONGED TO THAT KID.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.056
YO, I AIN'T
KILLED THAT KID.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.432
HOW'D YOU GET THE GUN?

14:10.516 --> 14:12.434
IT WAS A BUSINESS DEAL--

14:12.518 --> 14:13.811
THE GUN
FOR SOMETHING I HAD.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.521
MICHAEL, WE DO NOT CARE

14:15.563 --> 14:17.356
ABOUT THE DRUGS
THAT YOU SOLD, OK?

14:17.439 --> 14:19.358
TELL US WHO
THE DEAL WAS WITH.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.822
THE DEAL WAS WITH
THE 2 WHITE KIDS,

14:24.864 --> 14:26.824
BUT I DON'T KNOW NOTHIN'
ABOUT THE ROOF THING.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.535
BY THE TIME OUR BOY
GOT THREW OVER THE ROOF,

14:29.618 --> 14:34.331
I WAS WITH LITTLE
SHANTE IN HER CRIB,
AND YOU CAN ASK HER.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.083
WE BOTH HEARD HIM SPLAT.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.710
ALL RIGHT,
STICK WITH THE GUNS.

14:37.751 --> 14:39.712
THE 2 WHITE KIDS
SOLD YOU THAT GUN.

14:39.753 --> 14:40.713
YEAH.

14:40.754 --> 14:41.714
AND THAT WAS IT
FOR ME.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.049
UH-UH. UH-UH, MICHAEL.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.093
YOU KNOW
WHO WAS ON THE ROOF.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.681
HELL, MAN.
I CAN FALL, TOO.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.143
YOU PREFER
A NEEDLE IN THE ARM?

14:54.226 --> 14:56.228
LETHAL INJECTION?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.983
IF I HELP YOU
WITH THE ROOF,

15:01.066 --> 15:02.818
CAN I GET RHYTHM
ON THE GUN?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.820
LOOK, I COULD CARE LESS
ABOUT THE GUN.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.530
THAT KID DID NOT DIE
FROM GUNSHOTS.

15:08.574 --> 15:12.036
THOSE 2 WHITE KIDS
WERE SELLING GUNS
FOR SMACK.

15:12.077 --> 15:15.539
OUR DEAL WAS 12 DECKS
FOR THE ONE GUN.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.708
YOU BOUGHT THAT GUN
FOR 12 DECKS OF SMACK?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.710
LIONEL WILLIAMS
WAS ONE,

15:19.752 --> 15:23.213
AND THE OTHER,
I JUST KNOW HIM
AS, UH...

15:23.255 --> 15:24.965
VONDELL.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.592
THOSE AREN'T WHITE KIDS'
NAMES.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.261
I'M SAYIN' THERE WAS
2 BLACK KIDS THERE

15:29.303 --> 15:32.181
LOOKIN' TO BUY
A BUNCH OF GUNS
FOR SOME REAL WEIGHT.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.183
I CAN'T VOUCH
THAT EITHER OF THEM

15:34.266 --> 15:36.310
HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT HAPPENED
ON THE ROOF.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.938
BUT WHEN I WAS LEAVIN',
AN ARGUMENT
WAS BREAKIN' OUT.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.982
BETWEEN VONDELL AND LIONEL,
WHO SUPPOSEDLY
HAD A LOT OF SMACK,

15:42.066 --> 15:44.610
AND THE 2 WHITE KIDS
THAT HAD THE GUNS?

15:44.652 --> 15:48.864
VONDELL AND LIONEL
WAS LOOKIN' TO GET
LIKE A DOZEN, YOU KNOW,

15:48.948 --> 15:50.908
AND THEN
THERE WAS SOME DRAMA

15:50.950 --> 15:53.661
OVER WHETHER
ALL THE GUNS WERE THERE

15:53.744 --> 15:55.204
OR ALL THE SMACK
WAS THERE.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.997
I DON'T EVEN
REALLY KNOW, YOU KNOW?

15:57.081 --> 15:59.041
I GOT WHAT I CAME TO GET
AND I SPLIT.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.626
AND YOU'D NEVER SEEN
THESE WHITE KIDS BEFORE?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.628
A FEW TIMES, YOU KNOW.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.296
NOT ENOUGH
TO KNOW THEIR NAMES.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.132
A LOT OF WHITE KIDS
COME THROUGH THE 'HOOD,
TRYING TO SCORE DOPE.

16:07.174 --> 16:10.052
PRETTY MUCH LOOK ALIKE
TO YOU, HUH?

16:10.135 --> 16:11.971
HOW ABOUT THE BLACK GUYS?

16:12.054 --> 16:14.431
YOU GOT A PLACE ON THEM
FOR US?

16:15.683 --> 16:17.476
ON LIONEL.

16:17.559 --> 16:20.270
VONDELL
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.730
CAN YOU WRITE?

16:21.814 --> 16:24.149
HOW MUCH YOU WANT ME
TO WRITE?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.655
WRITE LIONEL'S ADDRESS.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.668
YO...CAN I BANK
SOME LOVE

16:42.710 --> 16:46.088
FOR THE NEXT TIME
I HAVE A LITTLE RUN-IN
WITH THE LAW?

16:46.171 --> 16:47.715
ATM IS OPEN.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.217
I DID HEAR AFTERWARDS
ON THE STREETS

16:50.300 --> 16:52.302
THE REASON WHY
LIONEL AND VONDELL

16:52.344 --> 16:54.930
LET THE ONE
WHITE KID RUN
BUT THE OTHER ONE FLEW.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.390
WHY?

16:56.473 --> 16:59.893
THE ONE WHITE KID
KEPT HIS MOUTH SHUT.

16:59.977 --> 17:02.521
THE OTHER
KEPT CALLING 'EM
"NIGGERS."

17:02.604 --> 17:04.481
HE'S THE ONE FLEW?

17:04.523 --> 17:06.442
FROM THE ROOF...

17:07.443 --> 17:09.236
TO THE GROUND.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.453
CAN I HELP YOU
LOOK FOR THAT FILE?

17:17.536 --> 17:19.079
NO. I FOUND IT.
THANKS.

17:21.081 --> 17:24.043
SO YOU'RE GONNA
STAY HERE FOR A WHILE?

17:24.084 --> 17:25.502
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING
FROM ME, DOLORES?

17:25.544 --> 17:26.754
NO.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.589
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG I'M GONNA BE HERE.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.882
NO PROBLEM.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.765
WHAT DID HE KNOW?

17:37.848 --> 17:39.433
IT DON'T LOOK LIKE
THIS ONE
WAS ON THE ROOF.

17:39.516 --> 17:40.934
HE WAS BANGIN'
LITTLE SHANTE.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.270
HE GAVE US
2 OTHER DEALERS
WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE IT.

17:43.353 --> 17:46.440
SAID THESE WHITE KIDS
WE'RE TRADING GUNS
FOR SMACK.

17:46.523 --> 17:49.568
HE HAD SOLD THEM
12 DECKS FOR THE ONE GUN
WE CAUGHT HIM WITH.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.445
AS THIS ONE
WAS LEAVING,
THE OTHER 2 DEALERS

17:51.528 --> 17:54.156
BEGAN BICKERING
WITH THE WHITE KIDS
FOR A LARGE-VOLUME SWAP.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.949
HE SAID WHEN HE WAS LEAVING,

17:56.033 --> 17:58.660
IT SOUNDED LIKE
THIS OTHER DEAL
WAS GOING QUEER.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.537
HE GIVE YOU A PLACE
TO LOOK FOR THE OTHER TWO.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.039
Simone:
YEAH, ONE OF THEM.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.417
AS FAR AS WHY
THE ONE KID GOT TOSSED
AND NOT THE OTHER,

18:05.459 --> 18:09.004
THIS GUY SAYS
THAT HE HEARD
ON THE STREET AFTERWARDS

18:09.088 --> 18:12.257
UP ON THE ROOF
THE D.O.A. WAS ALL
IN THE BLACK DEALER'S FACE--

18:12.299 --> 18:14.259
Simone:
"NIGGER THIS,
NIGGER THAT."

18:14.301 --> 18:15.427
WEAVER'S SON?

18:15.511 --> 18:17.554
THE D.O.A.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.640
GOT IT.
HEY.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.813
SO WHERE'D YOU LEAVE IT
WITH THAT ASSHOLE?

18:25.896 --> 18:27.815
HE WENT HOME
TO CALM DOWN,

18:27.898 --> 18:31.944
THINK OF NAMES
WHO HIS SON
MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITH.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.947
BRING HIM IN AGAIN.
AND I WANT TO BE THERE
TO RE-INTERVIEW.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.741
AS OPPOSED TO
PICKING THE ONE DEALER UP?

18:37.783 --> 18:40.452
I'LL HAVE UNIFORM
AND NARCOTICS
PICK THEM UP.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.789
I WANT TO SEE
HOW WEAVER'S COMING
WITH THOSE NAMES.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.749
I COULD DO THAT
ON THE PHONE.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.960
IS TODAY THE DAY
I START EXPLAINING TO YOU

18:48.001 --> 18:50.129
WHY I WANT TO DO
AN INTERVIEW?

18:50.212 --> 18:52.172
APPARENTLY NOT.

18:54.758 --> 18:56.677
DON'T--DON'T TELL ME.
DON'T TELL ME.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.471
THEY DRAG PEOPLE
FROM OTHER COUNTRIES
TO POLICE STATIONS

18:59.555 --> 19:00.806
WITHOUT EXPLANATION.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.016
I DID NOT THINK
IT WAS ALLOWED
IN AMERICA.

19:03.100 --> 19:07.104
I ASKED VERY POLITELY
IF YOU'D COME WITH US,
MS. KEBEDE.

19:08.438 --> 19:11.108
WE WERE HOPING
THAT YOU COULD GIVE US
SOME INFORMATION

19:11.150 --> 19:13.694
REGARDING YOUR BROTHER
HAILU.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.488
IS HE IN TROUBLE?

19:16.530 --> 19:18.824
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING
TO DETERMINE.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.826
HAVE YOU SPOKEN WITH HIM
LATELY?

19:20.868 --> 19:21.994
NO.

19:22.035 --> 19:25.080
AS FAR AS HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIS WIFE,

19:25.164 --> 19:26.999
UH, HAVE YOU EVER NOTED
ANY, UM,

19:27.040 --> 19:28.584
DISSATISFACTION
ON HIS PART?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.627
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO MULU?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.963
WOULD YOU BE SURPRISED
IF SOMETHING HAD?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.673
SHE WAS AN EVIL WOMAN.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.843
IF HARM CAME TO HER,
IT WOULD NOT
SURPRISE ME.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.345
WHAT ABOUT HER, EXACTLY,
WAS EVIL?

19:43.348 --> 19:46.435
IN GENERAL, WHAT WOULD YOU
CONSIDER EVIL?

19:46.518 --> 19:48.937
ONE WHO NEGLECTS
TO PREPARE MEALS,

19:49.021 --> 19:50.355
BEING DISOBEDIENT,

19:50.397 --> 19:51.523
GETTING FAT.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.317
SO AS A WIFE
SHE WAS EVIL.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.402
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF WIFE
SHE WAS.

19:55.485 --> 19:56.570
BUT, UH...

19:56.653 --> 19:58.530
THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR, UM,

19:58.614 --> 20:00.532
WOULDN'T SIT WELL
WITH MR. KEBEDE.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.576
IT WOULD BE
UP TO MY BROTHER.

20:02.659 --> 20:05.495
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MY BROTHER WOULD DO
IN EVERY SITUATION.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.122
I AM NOT HIM.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.542
WERE YOU AWARE MULU,
YOUR BROTHER'S WIFE,
WAS KILLED THIS MORNING?

20:13.295 --> 20:14.463
NO.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.633
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
YOUR BROTHER IS NOW?

20:17.716 --> 20:21.011
IF YOU KNOW
WHERE HAILU IS
AND YOU DON'T TELL US,

20:21.053 --> 20:23.013
<i>YOU </i>CAN GO TO JAIL.

20:26.934 --> 20:29.478
MULU WAS KILLED
THIS MORNING, CUT UP,

20:29.561 --> 20:31.355
AND STUFFED
INTO A REFRIGERATOR.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.858
AT THIS POINT,
HAILU IS OUR MOST
LIKELY SUSPECT

20:34.900 --> 20:38.654
AND WILL REMAIN SO
UNTIL HE SHOWS UP
TO CLEAR HIS NAME.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.073
YOU SUSPECT HIM
BECAUSE HE'S FROM
ANOTHER COUNTRY.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.742
YOU'VE GOT
RACIAL PREJUDICE.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.745
NO, MA'AM.
I'VE GOT PREJUDICE
AGAINST PEOPLE WHO DO MURDER

20:46.787 --> 20:48.997
AND LEAVE THE CORPSE
FOR A 12-YEAR-OLD TO FIND.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.499
THE BOY CAN HANDLE IT.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.501
HIS HEAD IS FILLED
WITH VIOLENCE

20:52.584 --> 20:54.503
FROM TELEVISION
AND VIDEO GAMES.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.755
MAY I GO NOW?

21:15.732 --> 21:18.235
OR DID THIS KID'S FAMILY
MOVE OUT?

21:18.277 --> 21:21.113
WE'LL GO OVER THE LIST WITH YOU
AND YOUR SON'S FRIENDS.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.781
I THINK...

21:22.823 --> 21:26.702
I--I THINK THIS FAMILY
MOVED OUT A FEW YEARS AGO.

I--I NEED TO BE BY MYSELF.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.943
OK.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.236
JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.487
I UNDERSTAND.

33:10.989 --> 33:11.990
I UNDERSTAND.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.076
I-I'M SORRY.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.828
IT'S OK.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.171
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

33:27.255 --> 33:29.215
[SHIVERING AND SOBBING]

33:29.257 --> 33:32.260
I--I--I CAN'T LOOK
AT YOU, THOUGH.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.678
OK.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.695
IT'S OK. I UNDERSTAND.

34:17.597 --> 34:21.142
Fancy: BOTTOM LINE,
WITHOUT IMMUNITY,
THIS KID DOESN'T COOPERATE

34:21.184 --> 34:23.936
I.D.ing THE GUYS
THAT PUSHED HIS FRIEND
OFF THE ROOF.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.355
YOU SEE, OTHERWISE,
I'M INCRIMINATIN' MYSELF.

34:26.439 --> 34:27.648
YEAH, I GET IT.

34:27.690 --> 34:31.069
I UNDERSTAND
BELLPORT'S A CITY, TOO.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.737
BUT HOW IS
GRANTING IMMUNITY

34:32.820 --> 34:35.364
IN A ROBBERY YOU DON'T
HAVE THE EVIDENCE TO GO
TO BAT ON ANYWAY

34:35.406 --> 34:37.241
ANY SKIN OFF
BELLPORT'S NOSE?

34:41.329 --> 34:42.538
YES. ALL RIGHT.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.624
YES. YES,
I APPRECIATE IT.

34:45.625 --> 34:46.626
I APPRECIATE IT.

34:48.002 --> 34:49.879
YEAH. THANKS.

34:52.673 --> 34:55.051
HE GETS HIS WAIVER
ON THE GUN STORE.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.720
YOU FIND RUSSELL?

34:57.804 --> 34:58.805
YEAH.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.141
DETECTIVE SIMONE.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.727
Sipowicz:
STANLEY FOWLER.

35:04.811 --> 35:07.313
HE'S, UH,
HE'S WITH BILLY WEAVER
ON THE ROOF.

35:07.396 --> 35:08.648
HOW'S IT GOING,
STANLEY?

35:08.731 --> 35:11.609
JUST AS I WAS CONSIDERING
CONTACTING YOU PEOPLE,

35:11.692 --> 35:13.486
THIS DETECTIVE SHOWS UP
AT MY HOUSE.

35:13.569 --> 35:14.612
IS THAT RIGHT?

35:14.695 --> 35:16.656
BILLY'S GRIEVING FATHER
SENT HIM OVER.

35:16.739 --> 35:19.659
ANYWAY, THE BELLPORT
D.A. SIGNED OFF.

35:19.742 --> 35:22.995
AND I'M NOT PROSECUTABLE HERE
EITHER FOR SELLING THE GUNS?

35:23.079 --> 35:24.455
NOT AS LONG AS
YOU COOPERATE.

35:24.539 --> 35:28.000
SO THE GUYS THAT PUSHED OFF
BILLY ARE IN CUSTODY?

35:28.084 --> 35:29.836
YOU WANT ME TO LOOK
AT A LINEUP?

35:29.919 --> 35:32.338
THESE DETECTIVES
WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

35:34.715 --> 35:36.342
ONE OF 'EM AGREED
TO A LINEUP?

35:36.425 --> 35:39.512
BEFORE WE DECIDE ON THAT,
YOU WANT A REFRESHMENT
OF SOME SORT?

35:39.595 --> 35:41.681
NO, I'M READY TO START
MY COOPERATION.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.766
NO, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
A REFRESHMENT FIRST.

35:45.434 --> 35:46.352
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TAKE A SODA.

35:46.435 --> 35:47.937
NO. HAVE SOME COFFEE.

35:49.522 --> 35:50.857
COFFEE'S IN THERE.

35:52.441 --> 35:53.943
OH, ANDY, THIS ROOM
IS OCCUPIED.
SOMEBODY'S
IN THERE?

35:54.026 --> 35:55.278
YEAH, IT'S ONE
OF THE GUYS.

35:55.361 --> 35:56.779
YOU CAN'T HAVE
NO COFFEE. THIS
ROOM'S OCCUPIED.

35:56.863 --> 35:57.947
THAT'S ONE OF THE GUYS
THREW BILLY OFF THE ROOF.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.240
WHO? THIS GUY IN THERE?

35:59.282 --> 36:01.075
I'M TELLING YOU,
HE'S ONE OF THEM.

36:01.117 --> 36:02.451
[SIGHS]

36:04.203 --> 36:05.538
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.

36:07.874 --> 36:11.127
MR. KEBEDE, WHERE WERE YOU
THIS MORNING AROUND 8:00?

36:11.210 --> 36:12.587
I WAS OUT
BUYING GROCERIES.

36:12.628 --> 36:14.463
WHERE WERE YOU GONNA
PUT 'EM, MR. KEBEDE?

36:14.547 --> 36:17.133
FROM WHAT WE SAW,
YOUR REFRIGERATOR
WAS ALL FULL UP.

36:17.216 --> 36:19.802
I WAS OUT BUYING
FOOD FOR ALMAZ.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.637
I HELP HER.
SHE'S A FRIEND.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.139
SHE'S NOT YOUR FRIEND.
SHE'S YOUR WIFE.

36:23.222 --> 36:25.474
AND THE CHILD SHE'S CARRYING
IS YOUR CHILD.

36:25.558 --> 36:27.643
MR. KEBEDE,
IS IT NOT CORRECT

36:27.727 --> 36:30.104
THAT UNTIL THIS MORNING
YOU WERE A BIGAMIST?

36:30.146 --> 36:32.481
BUT WE'LL CROSS THAT OFF
THE LIST OF CHARGES

36:32.565 --> 36:34.483
SINCE BY KILLING HER,
YOU'RE REALLY NO LONGER
MARRIED.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.651
YOU HAVE A LOT TO SAY.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.737
WAS I TALKING TOO MUCH?

36:37.820 --> 36:41.616
YOU SEE,
THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
A MULTIPLE FAMILY MAN

36:41.657 --> 36:44.994
WON'T HELP YOU WITH A JUDGE
AND JURY CONCERNING
YOUR FIRST WIFE'S DEATH.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.329
I DIDN'T KILL MULU.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.289
THE D.A. WILL PRESENT
THE CASE

36:48.331 --> 36:50.625
THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE
KNEW OF YOUR DISSATISFACTION

36:50.666 --> 36:52.627
WITH YOUR WIFE'S DESIRE
TO BE INDEPENDENT

36:52.668 --> 36:54.128
AND HER WEIGHT PROBLEM.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.130
IT'LL LOOK LIKE
YOU TRADED HER IN.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.633
MR. KEBEDE, WHAT YOU
WANT TO DO NOW

36:58.674 --> 37:02.053
IS THINK OF A WAY TO MAKE
YOUR POSITION SYMPATHETIC.

37:02.136 --> 37:04.847
LIKE THIS MORNING YOU...
ACTED OUT OF PASSION.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.807
SHE DIDN'T COOK
YOUR EGGS RIGHT,
AND YOU SNAPPED.

37:06.849 --> 37:10.645
UH...SOMETHING
BROUGHT YOU TO A BOIL,

37:10.686 --> 37:11.938
AND--AND YOU LOST CONTROL.

37:13.189 --> 37:15.233
I DID NOTHING.
I WAS OUT.

37:15.316 --> 37:18.486
MR. KEBEDE, WE'RE TRYING
TO WORK WITH YOU
ON AN EXCUSE HERE,

37:18.527 --> 37:20.863
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM
TO BE TRYING VERY HARD.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.740
THINK, YOU IDIOT.
YOU SHUT UP.

37:22.823 --> 37:23.950
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE HELPFUL.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.409
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
SPEAKING TO ME THIS WAY.

37:25.493 --> 37:26.535
BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN.

37:26.619 --> 37:27.662
PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW
THEIR PLACE.

37:27.703 --> 37:28.788
YOU DO NOT.

37:28.871 --> 37:30.706
Medavoy: WAS THAT
THE CASE WITH MULU?

37:30.790 --> 37:32.208
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
HER PLACE?

37:32.291 --> 37:34.377
SHE WAS NOT
A GOOD WIFE.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.503
DISOBEDIENT?

37:35.544 --> 37:37.004
IN A MILLION WAYS.

37:37.046 --> 37:39.507
THAT MUST'VE MADE YOU
VERY ANGRY.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.509
IT WAS NOT
RIGHT.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.970
SO WHAT HAPPENED
THIS MORNING,
MR. KEBEDE?

37:47.348 --> 37:49.350
YOU SEE, SIR...

37:49.392 --> 37:53.354
PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND
A MOMENTARY LOSS OF CONTROL,

37:53.396 --> 37:55.564
BUT UNLESS YOU PRESENT THAT,

37:55.648 --> 37:57.400
YOU'LL BE SEEN AS
A COLD-HEARTED KILLER.

37:57.483 --> 38:00.444
AND--AND LOOKING AT, UH,

38:00.528 --> 38:03.072
ALMAZ'S IMMINENT
EXPECTATION,

38:03.155 --> 38:06.117
KILLING MULU
COULD BE SEEN AS A PLAN

38:06.200 --> 38:09.620
THAT YOU HAD IN THE WORKS
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.372
IS IT THE TRUTH

38:11.414 --> 38:14.375
THAT YOU ARE A PLOTTING,
COLD-HEARTED KILLER?

38:14.417 --> 38:15.876
NO.

38:15.918 --> 38:18.629
THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.632
DID MULU DO SOMETHING
TO UPSET YOU?

38:21.716 --> 38:24.468
SHE WOULD NOT COOK
OR CLEAN TODAY

38:24.552 --> 38:26.512
SO TO GET HER NAILS
DONE.

38:26.595 --> 38:27.763
AND DID YOU FIGHT
OVER THAT?

38:29.390 --> 38:30.433
YES.

38:31.934 --> 38:32.935
DID IT GET PHYSICAL?

38:33.019 --> 38:35.980
SHE WAS
A VERY BAD WIFE.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.106
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

38:37.189 --> 38:38.482
WE UNDERSTAND.

38:38.566 --> 38:41.277
AND SO IF IT DID GET PHYSICAL,
THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE.

38:41.319 --> 38:44.322
WAS THAT THE CASE,
MR. KEBEDE?

38:44.405 --> 38:47.658
SHE WAS YELLING, AND YOU
DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO

38:47.742 --> 38:49.327
TO GET HER TO SHUT UP.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.329
I DID WHAT WAS
NECESSARY.

38:51.412 --> 38:52.663
YOU STRANGLED HER.

38:52.747 --> 38:53.789
DO YOU NEED
EVERYTHING EXPLAINED?

38:53.873 --> 38:55.166
BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED?

38:58.794 --> 39:00.296
AND WHAT DID YOU DO
AFTER THAT?

39:00.379 --> 39:02.673
PUT HER
IN THE REFRIGERATOR

39:02.757 --> 39:04.216
SO IT WOULD NOT SMELL...

39:04.300 --> 39:06.844
UNTIL WE WERE AWAY.

39:06.927 --> 39:08.137
YOU AND ALMAZ?

39:13.893 --> 39:16.979
WERE YOU PLANNING ON
LEAVING TOWN WITHOUT EDDIE?

39:17.063 --> 39:19.273
HE'S HIS MOTHER'S CHILD.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.817
BOTH OF THEM
LOST TO THIS COUNTRY.

39:27.823 --> 39:31.285
I'D LIKE YOU TO WRITE DOWN
WHAT YOU JUST TOLD US.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.707
I-I'M NOT COLD-BLOODED.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.752
THERE ARE SIMPLY WAYS
THINGS SHOULD BE.

39:41.128 --> 39:43.130
WRITE IT.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.186
HOW YOU DOING
WITH VONDELL?

39:57.228 --> 39:58.938
THAT'S GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.

40:00.731 --> 40:03.526
YOU NEED ME GOIN'
IN THERE TO CONFIRM
THAT LIONEL'S FLIPPING?

40:03.609 --> 40:06.695
I GAVE THEM SOME OF THE DETAILS
OF HIS STATEMENT.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.697
VONDELL AND THE COUSIN
ARE CONSULTING.

40:08.781 --> 40:11.867
THAT ONE EXPRESS
ANY APPRECIATION TO YOU?

40:11.951 --> 40:12.952
I DIDN'T SEE HIM.

40:13.035 --> 40:14.412
FANCY I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

40:14.495 --> 40:16.747
I THOUGHT HE WAS IN
THE OBSERVATION ROOM
WATCHING YOU.

40:16.831 --> 40:20.543
HE WATCHES ME THE LAST
HALF-HOUR WITH VONDELL
AND CLARENCE DARROW.

40:20.626 --> 40:22.211
HE COMES OUT OF
THE OBSERVATION ROOM

40:22.294 --> 40:23.712
WHEN I LEAVE THE TWO
OF THEM ALONE,

40:23.754 --> 40:26.465
HE DOESN'T SAY "BOO" OR
ANY TYPE OF APPRECIATION.

40:26.549 --> 40:27.716
OK, ANDY,
I'M GOING HOME.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.888
I'M GOING HOME, BOSS.

40:32.972 --> 40:35.766
DIANE'S NOT FEELING WELL
AND ALL. I'M GOING HOME.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.060
NICE WORK TODAY, BOBBY.

40:40.271 --> 40:41.814
OK. THANKS.

40:41.897 --> 40:45.025
YEAH. YEAH, EXCELLENT
INDIVIDUAL POLICE WORK.

40:45.067 --> 40:46.694
I WAS ABOUT TO TELL YOU
NICE WORK, TOO.

40:46.735 --> 40:48.654
WELL, WHAT A RELIEF THAT IS.
I WAS JUST TELLING SIMONE

40:48.737 --> 40:50.990
HOW I LIVE FOR
YOUR OCCASIONAL ATTA-BOYS.

40:51.073 --> 40:53.325
OH, YOU LOVE WHAT HAPPENED
HERE TODAY, ANDY, DON'T YOU?

40:53.409 --> 40:54.577
I LOVED WHAT HAPPENED <i>HERE.</i>

40:54.618 --> 40:56.454
I LOVED DRIVING THE 2 DRIVES
TO RIVERHEAD...

40:56.537 --> 40:57.830
MY GOD.

40:57.913 --> 40:59.999
BECAUSE JUST WORKING
A HOMICIDE

41:00.082 --> 41:02.418
I FIND INSUFFICIENTLY
STIMULATING.

41:02.501 --> 41:05.796
I LIKE ALSO THE COMPLICATIONS
INVOLVED IN CLEANING UP
SOMEBODY ELSE'S MESS!

41:05.880 --> 41:07.089
PAST TELLING YOU GOOD WORK,

41:07.173 --> 41:09.758
I ALSO WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR NOT SITTING QUIET

41:09.842 --> 41:11.302
WHILE SOMEONE CALLED ME
"NIGGER."

41:11.385 --> 41:13.095
NO ONE WANTED YOU
SITTING QUIET.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.722
DIDN'T I TAKE HIM
OUTTA THE HOUSE

41:14.763 --> 41:16.265
WHEN HE USED
THAT LANGUAGE?!

41:16.348 --> 41:17.850
OH, I KNOW YOU TOOK HIM
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

41:17.933 --> 41:20.269
BUT WHAT I WOULD'VE
LIKED TO HAVE HEARD
WAS THE CONVERSATION

41:20.352 --> 41:21.520
ONCE YOU GOT HIM
OUTSIDE!

41:21.604 --> 41:23.564
WILL YOU SHUT UP?!

41:23.606 --> 41:25.608
BOTH OF YOU,
JUST SHUT UP!

41:33.949 --> 41:36.035
I HOPE YOU'RE
HAPPY NOW.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.479
SO YOU GONNA GO BACK IN
AND CLOSE WITH THEM?

42:03.521 --> 42:04.897
YOU GONNA GO BACK IN
AND WATCH?

42:04.980 --> 42:06.190
IS THAT ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU?

42:06.273 --> 42:07.816
HEY. BE MY GUEST.

42:36.428 --> 42:37.763
HI.

42:46.272 --> 42:48.274
HOW--HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

43:04.206 --> 43:06.208
DIANE...

43:09.378 --> 43:12.381
OH, MAN, WHEN I SAW YOU
BEFORE THERE, I...

43:14.633 --> 43:17.011
IT WAS LIKE WHEN MY WIFE
WAS DYING,

43:17.052 --> 43:19.346
AND I--I COULDN'T
DO NOTHIN' TO HELP.

43:19.388 --> 43:21.890
NO. NO.
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

43:32.026 --> 43:34.361
WE'RE TOGETHER.

43:34.403 --> 43:36.655
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE
CHILDREN.

43:36.739 --> 43:37.698
MM-HMM.

43:37.740 --> 43:41.160
I WANT TO MAKE
A FAMILY WITH YOU.

43:41.243 --> 43:43.746
WE'LL HAVE
THAT MUCH LUCK.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.251
AND WE'LL
RAISE 'EM GOOD.
