00:16.900 --> 00:21.330
sorry,I was trying to be quiet,but there's
not enough room in here to swing a cat.

00:22.180 --> 00:23.930
Did you just say "swing a cat"?

00:23.930 --> 00:26.490
Where I come from,cats
sometimes get swung.

00:27.540 --> 00:30.210
But now that you're up,can
I tell you about my day?

00:30.210 --> 00:34.010
No,you can't,because I have
a little something for you.

00:36.260 --> 00:39.920
Just for being one of L.A.'S
top and up-and-coming chefs.

00:45.910 --> 00:48.190
Oh,my god. Thank you.

00:48.490 --> 00:49.980
I have the perfect place to put it,too.

00:49.980 --> 00:51.530
- Where?
- My office.

00:51.530 --> 00:53.690
- The kitchen?
- I mean my office.

00:54.020 --> 00:56.000
I've been promoted to head chef.

00:57.040 --> 01:01.100
on probation,of course. I still have
a lot to prove. But,kevin,head chef.

01:01.210 --> 01:02.390
Oh,my god.

01:03.390 --> 01:04.970
that is so amazing.

01:04.970 --> 01:05.780
Wait!

01:05.780 --> 01:09.950
Saturday's "yay,scotty made it into the artic"
dinner is now a "yay,scotty got promoted" dinner.

01:09.950 --> 01:12.270
God,have I told you how much
I love your family recently?

01:12.270 --> 01:15.790
I-I can't imagine my parents
throwing me a "yay,scotty" dinner.

01:16.460 --> 01:19.250
Although,they did once throw me
a "we're so disappointed" brunch.

01:19.250 --> 01:22.860
Considering sarah never throws dinner parties,I
actually think she likes you more than me.

01:22.860 --> 01:25.230
- God,do you know how long I've worked for this?
- Yeah.

01:25.540 --> 01:26.800
I am so proud of you.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.210
And the best part-- it
comes with a pay raise.

01:30.210 --> 01:33.120
So I get to do what I love
and bring home a real paycheck.

01:33.830 --> 01:35.500
Maybe we can talk about
getting a bigger place?

01:35.500 --> 01:37.980
- Wow,with cat swinging room?
- And maybe a deck?

01:38.850 --> 01:40.280
and a jacuzzi.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.310
Hardwood floors.

01:43.420 --> 01:47.120
so please... donate now  and
give as generously  as you can.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.810
You will make  a lasting difference
in the lives  of a deserving family

01:51.180 --> 01:54.620
and give them  the encouragement and support
they desperately need  at this time...

01:56.160 --> 01:57.210
what are you doing?

01:57.210 --> 01:59.350
Oh... in-insomnia.

01:59.940 --> 02:03.150
... Working minimum-wage
jobs  simply to meet her rent.

02:03.150 --> 02:05.420
Or anna,who,with her three children...

02:05.420 --> 02:08.820
I know that we're both upset that
the adoption didn't pan out,but...

02:09.479 --> 02:13.030
trish changed her mind. You have
got to stop beating yourself up.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.410
Oh,honey.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

02:15.410 --> 02:17.340
Go-- go back to bed. You
have a flight in the morning.

02:17.340 --> 02:20.570
I'm-- I'm just-- you know,I'll
be in bed as soon as this is over.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.800
- What is is?
- I'm making this donation to this organization for single mothers.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.310
Do you see that woman there?

02:27.310 --> 02:29.650
Okay,she has three children
that she's trying support.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.920
She has two jobs,and she
still can't make it work.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.840
But-- but somehow-- somehow
she gets through it,and now...

02:36.200 --> 02:39.490
now she has this
beautiful,beautiful place that--

02:39.490 --> 02:41.560
that she can call home.

02:42.110 --> 02:44.330
Ah,you know what? I'm gonna
make a donation to that,too.

02:44.610 --> 02:47.080
please give what you can. Donate now.

02:48.550 --> 02:51.310
nora,are you sure you don't want me
to go over some of your loan paperwork?

02:51.610 --> 02:55.030
If you feel compelled,knock
yourself out.

02:55.670 --> 02:59.050
But it's all filled out
and already approved.

02:59.310 --> 03:02.630
So you just invited me for
brkfast,huh? No ulterior motives?

03:02.630 --> 03:05.970
All right,I wanted to show off. I-I
wanted you to see how prepared I am.

03:05.970 --> 03:08.260
Well,color me impressed.

03:08.260 --> 03:10.320
Hey there,uncle saul. Good morning,mom.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.440
So,uncle saul,what are
you doing here so early?

03:13.440 --> 03:15.370
To tell you the truth,justin,I
really don't know.

03:15.370 --> 03:18.980
I thought your mother was using breakfast as
bait to get me to go to the auction with her.

03:18.980 --> 03:21.660
I don't need you to go
to the auction with me.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.890
I have this completely under control.

03:23.890 --> 03:26.260
There are two properties
I have my eye on.

03:26.260 --> 03:28.600
Either of 'em would be
perfect for the center.

03:28.930 --> 03:33.630
I've laid all the groundwork,and tomorrow,for
the first time in my life,I'm gonna buy a house.

03:34.280 --> 03:38.080
Granted,it's for other families,but
it's a milestone nonetheless.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.640
It's the second time.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.250
Second time you bought a house,right?

03:43.000 --> 03:43.900
First.

03:44.330 --> 03:47.110
Your father bought this
house without even telling me.

03:47.410 --> 03:49.550
It was a surprise for our anniversary.

03:50.090 --> 03:54.900
I don't even think I had a credit card with 
my own name on it until the mid-'70s.

03:54.990 --> 03:57.990
Well,thank you for this
wonderful breakfast.

03:57.990 --> 04:01.740
Now I am going home to await
the air conditioning repairman.

04:02.520 --> 04:05.970
Maybe I'll polish some silver when I get
home,huh? The glamorous life of a bachelor.

04:07.450 --> 04:09.940
good luck tomorrow. Bid
like the wind,my sister.

04:13.260 --> 04:14.520
poor guy.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.060
Come on. He doesn't have anything to do. He
doesn't have a job. He just mopes around all day.

04:18.329 --> 04:20.220
Hello,pot. Have you met kettle?

04:20.220 --> 04:23.240
That's hilariousmom. I think-- I think you're
forgetting the fact that I have a girlfriend,

04:23.240 --> 04:27.490
and I go to narcotics anonymous,
and I have recruiting duties.

04:28.630 --> 04:32.570
Okay,I'm pathetic,too,but you know what? At least
I don't spend my days w-waiting for a repairman or--

04:33.250 --> 04:34.310
or pishing silver.

04:34.310 --> 04:37.280
Never underestimate the
power of shiny silver.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.730
what about sage?

04:38.730 --> 04:42.890
I mean,my repertoire has been pretty limited the
last few years to fish sticks and mac and cheese.

04:42.890 --> 04:44.670
I really want him to like it.

04:44.670 --> 04:47.450
You know,I was thinking
about veal piccata.

04:47.450 --> 04:49.480
Is that upscale enough,do you think?

04:50.470 --> 04:51.710
- Kevin?
- What?

04:51.710 --> 04:54.710
Y-- yeah,that-- look,that's
fine. Stop-- stop stressing.

04:54.710 --> 04:56.600
He's just happy we're throwing
him a celebratory dinner.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.310
No,no,no,nowe. Me. I'm throwing
scotty a celebratory dinner.

05:00.810 --> 05:03.190
What about you? Are you gonna
get him something special?

05:03.190 --> 05:06.470
I mean,this is a really
big deal for scotty.

05:06.470 --> 05:08.460
Yeah,yeah,yeah. I'll think of something.

05:09.560 --> 05:14.240
Hey,is it a sign of depression if your wife would rather stay
up all night watching television than come to bed with you?

05:14.720 --> 05:18.360
Well,of course kitty's depressed. She thought
she was gonna get a baby in three months.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.210
- Who am I speaking to?
- Hey,robert.It's sarah.

05:21.670 --> 05:23.900
Kevin,speakerphone etiquette. Learn it.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.590
- Sorry.
- So what's kitty doing?

05:25.590 --> 05:29.160
She's not sleeping,and
she won't talk about it.

05:29.160 --> 05:33.900
She says she's fine,but stays up all night
obsessively donating to television charities.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.640
- That is not a good sign.
- That's bad.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.680
And I gotta fly back for the vote. I won't
be here till next week,so my thought--

05:38.680 --> 05:39.960
hold that thought.

05:40.740 --> 05:44.560
Oh,hey,mom. Listen,can I call you back?
Kitty's depressed. Robert needs advice.

05:46.730 --> 05:47.610
continue.

05:47.610 --> 05:50.050
Do you remember kitty's
homecoming dance junior year?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.870
Thdance of humiliation?

05:51.870 --> 05:53.030
What's the dance of humiliation?

05:53.030 --> 05:55.690
- It was right after the spandex debacle.
- Spandex debacle?

05:55.690 --> 05:58.770
Yeah,she was so freaked out,dad thought
she'd actually have to transfer schools.

05:58.770 --> 06:01.900
Yeah,but then she went up to ojai with
tommy,and when she came back,she was fine.

06:02.340 --> 06:03.490
Oh,right. What'd he do?

06:03.970 --> 06:06.000
You know,I actually don't know.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.390
You know,I don't think reliving an awkward high
school incident is pertinent to the discussion.

06:09.390 --> 06:10.650
- KeviN.
- I'm on it.

06:13.190 --> 06:13.860
hello.

06:13.860 --> 06:15.520
Tommy,it's kevin.
Look,kitty's depressed.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.830
Do you remember what you
did in ojai to cheer her up?

06:17.830 --> 06:19.470
uh,yes,I remember.

06:19.990 --> 06:21.380
- Hello.
- What's wrong with kitty?

06:21.970 --> 06:23.530
Walker news travels fast.

06:23.530 --> 06:25.110
Put me on speakerphone.

06:25.110 --> 06:28.290
Uh,okay,but,everyone,let's
try not to talk l at once.

06:28.290 --> 06:30.170
That was supposed to be a
secret between me and kitty.

06:30.170 --> 06:31.940
- Maybe I should talk to her.
- that's not a good idea,mom.

06:31.940 --> 06:33.180
What are you talking about?
It was,like,a lifetime ago.

06:33.180 --> 06:34.520
This is about kitty,remember?

06:34.520 --> 06:37.940
You all think you know how to cheer
kitty up. I'm her mother,for god sakes.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.130
How can you people
hear yourselves think?

06:40.130 --> 06:41.340
- Is that justin?
- No.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.180
- no,it's robert.
- Robert.

06:42.180 --> 06:43.980
- Robert,are you listening to me?
- Trying.

06:43.980 --> 06:47.660
Look,kitty doesn't do well
with time on her hands.

06:47.660 --> 06:49.550
- No news to anyone.
- Well,I knew that.

06:49.550 --> 06:51.370
- Look,do you guys want my help or not?
- YeS.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.290
Fine. After the
spandex incident--

06:53.290 --> 06:55.410
the spandex
incident? The span--

06:55.410 --> 06:58.230
- oh,good lord in heaven.
- Okay,can someone please clarify for me the spandex incident?

06:58.230 --> 06:59.160
You don't want to know.

06:59.160 --> 07:03.010
Look,we were hanging out at ojai,I-I gave
her a project toeep her mind off of things.

07:03.010 --> 07:04.720
- It was a win-win.
- What project?

07:04.720 --> 07:07.400
I... Let her write my
history paper for me.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.820
- Tommy walker.
- You let her? Oh,nice.

07:09.820 --> 07:13.260
I know. The worst thing is for
kitty to have nothing to do.

07:13.260 --> 07:15.760
She likes to do things,so keep her busy.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.110
You kn,I just finished a
proposal for greenatopia.

07:18.110 --> 07:21.290
I could give it to her,say
I really need her feedback.

07:21.290 --> 07:22.690
That'll keep her busy.

07:23.980 --> 07:25.610
I'm glad you called,robert.

07:25.610 --> 07:27.170
Actually,I didn'T. I...

07:27.680 --> 07:28.400
you're welcome.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.560
- ByE.
- Bye.

07:29.560 --> 07:30.340
Later.

07:30.340 --> 07:31.460
- ByE.
- ByE.

07:31.460 --> 07:34.490
Seriously,you have got to get a
referee for your family discussions.

07:34.490 --> 07:37.670
I can't make scotty's dinner,so
congratulate him for me?

07:37.670 --> 07:39.980
Yeah. At least one of us is doing well.

07:39.980 --> 07:41.880
Hey,you knew you were getting a pay cut.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.630
Yeah,it's just... you
know,after taxes,wow.

07:45.220 --> 07:46.900
Nobody goes into politics for the money.

07:47.330 --> 07:48.610
It's all about making a difference.

07:48.610 --> 07:50.860
Right. Who needs those
extra zeroes anyway?

Oh,no,I'm fine. Thanks.
I'm just waiting for scotty.

08:05.620 --> 08:06.660
Ah!

08:06.660 --> 08:08.630
You must be kevin,the husband.

08:08.630 --> 08:10.000
Yeah,yeah.
That's-- at's me.

08:10.000 --> 08:10.940
Oh,I'm vicki.

08:10.940 --> 08:12.190
Hi,vicki. Nice to meet you.

08:12.190 --> 08:13.820
Nice to meet you.

08:14.230 --> 08:16.050
So,uh,how proud are you?

08:16.450 --> 08:18.700
You know,pretty... pretty darn proud.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.220
- He's taking off like a rocket ship.
- Yeah.

08:21.220 --> 08:23.660
You can lie around on the
couch all day eating bonbons.

08:24.970 --> 08:28.570
Yeah,you know,I'm-- I'm not a big fan
of the bonbon,plus,I do have a job.

08:29.620 --> 08:32.799
by the way,you guys are
the cutest couple ever.

08:33.289 --> 08:34.120
Oh,thank you.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.620
I always tell scotty that if he
wasn't gay,I'd be all over his action.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.870
Ah,here he is.

08:42.049 --> 08:43.140
Holler at me if you need anything.

08:43.140 --> 08:45.390
Thanks,vicki. We'll be sure to holler.

08:47.270 --> 08:48.230
- hey,handsome.
- HeY.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.330
Sorry about that. Friends of the
mayor wanted to pay their compliments.

08:51.330 --> 08:55.430
Oh,well,as long as it's friends of the mayor and not
just ordinary rich and powerful people,that's fine.

08:55.730 --> 08:57.130
Oh,so you're bonding with vicki.

08:57.130 --> 08:59.720
Yeah,I'm pretty sure we could have her
over for a threesome if you're interested.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.070
Yeah,I know,but don't worry.

09:01.070 --> 09:03.880
I told her our apartment
wasn't big enough for group sex.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.110
Very clever.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.830
You're not in a very good mood.

09:07.830 --> 09:09.860
Huh? What? No,I'm fine. You know...

09:10.220 --> 09:11.090
what's the matter?

09:11.090 --> 09:13.840
Nothing. Just a minor financial hiccup.

09:14.370 --> 09:16.240
Oh. Define "hiccup.”

09:18.100 --> 09:19.200
we'll be fine.

09:19.880 --> 09:25.210
Kevin,I'm your spouse,your spouse who just got a
pay raise and would very much like to contribute.

09:25.210 --> 09:28.390
Great. So can you contribute some
food? I haven't eaten since is morning.

09:30.020 --> 09:32.010
as a matter of fact,I
know the head chef.

09:32.010 --> 09:35.280
I'll see what I can scrounge up.
But this conversation is not over.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.250
sarah.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.550
It's 12:00.

09:45.550 --> 09:48.250
You might want to start the
day,or at least take a shower.

09:48.930 --> 09:51.180
Yeah. Well--
well,yeah.

09:51.180 --> 09:53.010
You know,you're right.
You know,I just-- I--

09:53.010 --> 09:56.940
I w-- I was up really late
working on some charity working...

09:57.440 --> 09:58.960
oh. This should wake you up.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.190
WoW.

10:00.570 --> 10:02.420
Well,look--
wh-- thank you.

10:03.540 --> 10:04.450
Look at that.
It's got--

10:04.450 --> 10:07.340
it's got strawberries,chocolate
chips,cocoa pebbles--

10:07.340 --> 10:09.210
my favorite toppings.But,

10:09.540 --> 10:12.490
sarah,you don't need to cheer me up.

10:12.490 --> 10:15.130
Oh,I'm not here to cheer you
up. I'm here to butter you up.

10:15.570 --> 10:19.070
I'm completely overwhelmed with
this whole scotty dinner thing.

10:19.070 --> 10:21.510
The menu I planned is way too ambitious.

10:21.510 --> 10:24.250
Oh. Well,do you want
me to help you cook?

10:24.250 --> 10:27.250
oh,god,no. No,no. No,no.

10:27.670 --> 10:30.910
I was hoping you could help me
with my proposal for greenatopia.

10:30.910 --> 10:33.610
If you could look it over and
make sure everything's smooth.

10:34.230 --> 10:36.860
It's supposed to go out to
potential vendors on monday.

10:36.860 --> 10:37.800
Really?

10:37.800 --> 10:39.040
If you're not too busy.

10:39.040 --> 10:42.440
Uh,no,no. I-I-I could
probably find some time.

10:42.760 --> 10:43.780
Great.

10:47.050 --> 10:49.090
I'm-- I'm
learning spanish.

10:49.090 --> 10:55.170
So i was busted,I lost my medical
license,my friends,my savings.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.310
But here I am,seven years sober.

10:59.410 --> 11:00.420
Thank you.

11:01.710 --> 11:04.300
But lately,I have been
tempted. I have to admit it.

11:05.410 --> 11:07.920
You know,one little pill and
all the pain could go away.

11:08.600 --> 11:13.170
See,um,my boyfriend of ten
years,uh,hank,left me a few months ago.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.130
He said he needed space.

11:15.530 --> 11:17.410
So i ge him about 2,000 miles of it.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.080
I left cincinnati and
moved here to sunny cali.

11:21.490 --> 11:25.930
So there's,uh,no more
snow,no more hank's halitosis,

11:26.340 --> 11:29.100
but,uh,here I am,alone.

11:30.150 --> 11:33.880
I mean,my social life pretty much
consists of chatting with todd,the,uh,

11:34.120 --> 11:39.180
cable guy who,uh,gave me free movie
channels. So that's something,uh,there.

11:39.870 --> 11:44.100
But,uh,I guess ultimately,everyone's
just looking for companionship.

11:55.720 --> 11:56.700
hey,paul.

11:56.700 --> 11:58.210
Oh,hey.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.410
ah,I'm terrible with names.

12:00.410 --> 12:01.540
- Justin.
- Justin.

12:01.540 --> 12:04.110
Yeah,the,uh,the
ex-soldier,wounded knee.

12:04.110 --> 12:06.160
Oh,and the horndog dad issues,right?

12:07.080 --> 12:09.020
Yeah,yeah.
That-- that's me.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.720
Um,paul,listen,I-I know
this isn't exaly protocol.

12:13.720 --> 12:18.140
I was... I was just wondering if you
had dinner plans for tomorrow night.

12:18.590 --> 12:20.850
Oh,justin,I'M...

12:21.180 --> 12:22.490
so flattered.

12:22.490 --> 12:25.040
But I'm afraid i'm way
past my twink phase.

12:26.130 --> 12:28.380
Oh,no,no,no. No.
No,no,no,not for--

12:28.380 --> 12:29.960
I-I have a girlfriend--
Who's-- who's--

12:29.960 --> 12:31.080
- yeah,my
girl-- - oh.

12:31.080 --> 12:35.420
It's,um,I just wanted to invite you to a dinner
party. I think I know someone that you'd--

12:35.420 --> 12:37.830
that you'd really hit it off with,so...

12:38.880 --> 12:39.950
oh,um...

12:45.050 --> 12:47.170
it looked so pathetic in
the harsh light of day.

12:47.170 --> 12:49.400
It's no wonder people don't
go into public service anymore.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.010
Well,at least scotty's getting a raise.

12:51.010 --> 12:52.390
Yeah,I know,and I'm happy for him.

12:52.390 --> 12:56.700
It's just,you know,there's no getting away from
the fact,I'm in much less desirable tax brackeT.

12:57.660 --> 12:59.850
I gotta say,dad's office is
looking pretty good these days.

12:59.850 --> 13:01.990
My office,if you don't mind.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.370
Mm. Yeah,I'm sorry. Oh!

13:03.370 --> 13:04.760
These the houses you're bidding on?

13:04.760 --> 13:06.020
Yes,aren't they perfect?

13:06.020 --> 13:07.960
- Have you checked out the neighborhoods?
- Yes.

13:07.960 --> 13:13.990
I have even driven past at different times
of the day to check on the traffic situation,

13:14.280 --> 13:18.190
and I've spoken to the local police
departments about crime in the areas.

13:18.190 --> 13:19.150
Mm.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.010
- Have you been inside them?
- No.

13:21.010 --> 13:25.270
They're not open to the public,but I
have pictures from the auction houses.

13:25.270 --> 13:26.890
I've done my due diligence.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.950
- I think this one has potential.
- Oh,I know.

13:28.950 --> 13:32.370
Can you imagine how many families
I can help with a place that size?

13:32.370 --> 13:33.380
How long has it been vacant?

13:33.380 --> 13:34.850
- Nine months.
- Whew.

13:34.850 --> 13:35.640
What?

13:35.640 --> 13:39.690
The longer they stand vacant,the higher the chance
of them becoming infested with rodents or termites.

13:39.990 --> 13:41.460
That's what exterminators are for.

13:41.460 --> 13:43.390
Have you been to city
hall,pulled the records on them?

13:43.390 --> 13:43.880
Why?

13:43.880 --> 13:45.920
To see if there's any outstanding
building code violations.

13:45.920 --> 13:49.140
If there is,you assume liability,and
that becomes very expensive.

13:49.810 --> 13:50.920
How expensive?

13:50.920 --> 13:53.170
You don't want to know.
Look,I'm sure these are fine.

13:53.170 --> 13:55.610
Have you set,uh,your
maximum bid for the auction?

13:55.610 --> 13:56.580
Of course.

13:56.580 --> 13:59.130
Good. 'Cause you know
how you get. No offense.

13:59.130 --> 14:02.270
Well,offense taken. What
do you mean,how I get?

14:02.270 --> 14:05.490
People get carried away. They make rash
decisions based on their excitement.

14:06.030 --> 14:07.950
You know what I should do? I
should come with you tomorrow.

14:07.950 --> 14:09.350
- Oh,no,no. Kevin I don't-- 
- no,absolutely.

14:09.350 --> 14:11.680
I'll just walk you through the
process. I'll be there for support.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.580
- No problem. - I
don't need you to do--

14:12.580 --> 14:15.200
mom,I've looked after your
business affairs for years.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.810
I'm not about to throw you
to the wolves,okay? Done.

14:20.210 --> 14:23.030
If you want to pay me back,you can
come with me to the galleria tomorrow,

14:23.030 --> 14:25.440
and we can pick out a gift
for scotty.How about that?

14:27.590 --> 14:28.800
Okay.

14:32.380 --> 14:33.930
I'm telling you,he's perfect.

14:33.930 --> 14:36.910
His name's paul. He's not too
tall. He's gonna love saul.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.690
So basically,he's a dr.Seuss character?

14:38.690 --> 14:39.820
Oh,that's hilarious.

14:39.820 --> 14:42.180
Oh,you think that's hilarious?
Wait till saul meets him.

14:43.070 --> 14:44.650
Wait till saul meets who?

14:44.650 --> 14:48.540
Uh,justin is setting saul
up let's not knock N.A.,

14:48.540 --> 14:53.200
Considering your boyfriend,who you
love and adore,actually is in N.A.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.890
What was he addicted to?

14:54.890 --> 14:56.080
Uh,prescription drugs.

14:56.080 --> 14:58.090
Oh,well,could be worse.

14:58.090 --> 15:00.610
I mean,it's not like
it w crystal meth,right?

15:00.860 --> 15:02.880
Oh,that's great. Saul,meet paul.

15:03.350 --> 15:05.430
He's never done meth.
Saul will love that.

15:05.430 --> 15:06.680
You know what,rebecca?
It's gonna be fine.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.530
They'll have my family there as buffers.

15:08.530 --> 15:12.750
Besides,it is so hard to meet
someone,especially after a certain age.

15:13.290 --> 15:16.400
You kn,justin,that is a really
sweet thing you're doing.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.910
Thank you,holly.

15:20.710 --> 15:21.700
You hear that?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.190
Sorry. I gotta take this. Excuse me.

15:29.210 --> 15:30.860
You don't think it's a good idea,do you?

15:30.860 --> 15:32.510
It's a terrible idea.

15:32.510 --> 15:34.250
See,mom,why are you
encouraging him then?

15:34.250 --> 15:37.910
Because he's your boyfriend,and
I want him to like me.

15:37.910 --> 15:41.830
Or are you just excited at the possibility
of another walker dinner disaster?

15:41.830 --> 15:44.880
I have to admit,it's a little of both.

15:47.490 --> 15:49.220
All right,so it's okay if my
friend comes to the dinner?

15:49.220 --> 15:51.780
Yes,but I wish you'd
given me more notice.

15:52.090 --> 15:54.670
All right,and let's not make a big
deal about me setting saul up,all right?

15:54.670 --> 15:57.090
Let's play it casual. I don't
want them to feel uncomfortable.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.220
I will be very discreet.
Listen,honey,I gotta go.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.240
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:02.990 --> 16:04.760
Uh,what are you doing here so early?

16:04.760 --> 16:07.300
I read your proposal,and I
thought maybe we could go over it.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.270
You know,I'm a little distracted,getting
everything ready for tonight.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.980
Of course. I just thought thai could
talk to you,you know,while you cook.

16:15.060 --> 16:15.940
GreaT.

16:16.830 --> 16:18.710
So,uh,how did it read?

16:19.310 --> 16:21.980
Well,I thought that it was very...

16:24.340 --> 16:25.600
informative.

16:26.630 --> 16:27.700
What's with the pause?

16:27.700 --> 16:29.070
- No,no,it's good.
- Yeah?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.310
Whoa. That's a lot of typos.

16:35.310 --> 16:39.330
No,actually,I didn't even read it for
typos. Any monkey can fix a few typos.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.200
I-I focused on the deeper problems.

16:42.390 --> 16:43.040
What problems?

16:43.040 --> 16:44.800
Oh,not to worry. I have
a solution for everything.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.500
Now the first problem I had
was with the mission statement.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.570
The first sentence?

16:48.570 --> 16:52.450
Yeah,I just-- I don't think that your company
goals and objectives are direct enough.

16:53.190 --> 16:54.000
Hmm.

16:54.300 --> 16:55.780
And-- and then
on page two...

16:56.640 --> 16:58.950
,did you bring the,uh,cashier's
check for the deposit?

16:58.950 --> 17:00.540
- Of course I did.
- All right.

17:00.540 --> 17:04.700
Next on the block,a 4-bedroom home on a
beautiful tree-lined street in granada hills.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.380
This is the first one.
Oh,god. Here we go.

17:06.380 --> 17:07.589
Just-- just stay
calm,all right?

17:07.589 --> 17:08.500
- Breathe.
- Okay.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.339
I'm looking for an
opening bid for $300,000.

17:10.339 --> 17:12.859
Thank you,sir. $300,000 is your bid...

17:12.859 --> 17:14.369
whoa. Mom,what are you doing?

17:14.910 --> 17:16.280
You have plenty of time.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.410
Don't get into a bidding
war and drive the price up.

17:18.410 --> 17:21.359
Figure out how badly this guy
wants it,all right read the room.

17:21.690 --> 17:23.470
You read the room. I'm buying a house.

17:23.470 --> 17:26.280
Wait. Wasn't granada hills hit
really bad in the northridge quake?

17:26.280 --> 17:28.069
- What?
- Yeah,right where the overpass collapsed.

17:28.069 --> 17:30.950
- That was,like,14 years ago.
- Are you sure it didn't have earthquake damage?

17:30.970 --> 17:33.570
- I mean,you said it was okay,right?
- Yes,it's fine.

17:33.570 --> 17:35.110
All right,here
goes nothing. Wh--

17:35.600 --> 17:37.290
does that chimney look crooked to you?

17:37.290 --> 17:38.430
$450,000,going once.

17:38.430 --> 17:40.170
Yeah,that's definitely crooked.

17:40.170 --> 17:40.940
No,it's fine.

17:40.940 --> 17:41.850
- It's fine.
- Twice...

17:41.850 --> 17:43.440
you're just
being a total--

17:43.440 --> 17:45.280
sold to the gentleman in the back.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.090
Oh,I can't believe that just happened.

17:48.090 --> 17:48.980
What?

17:49.340 --> 17:51.590
Oh,come on. Look,if it wasn't
meant to be,it wasn't meant to be.

17:51.590 --> 17:53.600
Don't worry. We'll--
we'll get the second house.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.200
And now for a lovely
estate in artesia...

17:57.890 --> 18:02.040
oh,and-- and this-- this-- this
whole,um,social networking application?

18:02.040 --> 18:04.450
I mean,what-- what were
kyle and ethan even thinking?

18:04.450 --> 18:05.700
Actually,that was my idea.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.670
I don't-- I don't think it quite
meshes very well with your web site.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.810
Note to self--
work on meshing.

18:10.810 --> 18:14.930
Oh,and-- and this-- this slogan--
"a greener side of life," sarah?

18:16.070 --> 18:18.080
don't you think it's a little hokey?

18:20.850 --> 18:22.860
- excuse me.
- Sure.

18:26.130 --> 18:28.680
Ahh. Thank god,the wine.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.080
Yeah,I hope this is enough.
There's another case in the car.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.490
Oh,great. You should go get that.
We're gonna need it for later.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.100
Ah,meanwhile,I'll take this.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.400
You need help with anything?

18:37.400 --> 18:39.490
Yeah,I need you to help
me not to kill kitty.

18:40.060 --> 18:41.220
Who's kitty?

18:42.260 --> 18:43.590
- Who are you?
- Oh,I'm paul.

18:44.220 --> 18:46.450
And you must be sarah.
What a lovely home.

18:46.450 --> 18:49.100
I-I brought you a little
something. Uh,mind the pricklies.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.970
Uh... thank you,paul.

18:51.970 --> 18:52.800
Justin's friend.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.240
Oh,of course. I'm sorry.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.790
- Justin has friends.
- Apparently.

18:55.790 --> 18:57.900
Actually,I'm being set up with saul.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.750
I mean,what's he like? Is he sort
of the emotional,sensitive type?

19:00.750 --> 19:03.350
Or is he more of the,you
know,the strong man of few words?

19:03.860 --> 19:04.710
Saul?

19:05.030 --> 19:05.890
Our uncle?

19:05.890 --> 19:08.090
You know,I-I should just
let myself be surprised.

19:08.090 --> 19:10.360
You know,I guess I'm just a
little bit nervous,you know?

19:10.670 --> 19:12.610
It's,uh,it's been a long time r me.

19:12.610 --> 19:17.160
I haven't really had any chemistry with anyone
since,you know,since,like,the truman administration.

19:17.650 --> 19:21.190
You know,I haven't had that kind
of,you know,that hot,burning sensation.

19:23.750 --> 19:24.530
Right.

19:24.530 --> 19:28.560
Uh,the thing is,paul,that,um,the
dinner is not for two more hours.

19:28.560 --> 19:31.430
Oh,I know. Oh,I'm so sorry
about being such an early bird.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.540
It's fine.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.310
Well,you know,my license was revoked.

19:35.310 --> 19:37.510
You know,four D.U.I.S,and
they getough on you.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.540
So anyway,I had to take
three buses to get here.

19:39.540 --> 19:42.860
And I gave myself plenty of time.
Apparently a little bit too much time.

19:45.050 --> 19:48.350
and finally,an absolutely
extraordinary property,not to be missed.

19:48.350 --> 19:49.630
Here we go,the second house.

19:49.630 --> 19:52.220
You know,I... I-- I'm
really not feeling it today.

19:52.220 --> 19:55.630
Looking for an opening bid
of $550,000 for this beauty...

19:55.630 --> 19:57.740
- let's just go buy the gift for scotty.
- What?

19:58.130 --> 20:00.730
Look,I know you choked on the
first-- don't worry about it.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.420
I did not choke. I did not choke.

20:02.420 --> 20:07.020
I was fine until I listened to you and your
earthquake damage and vermin infestation.

20:07.020 --> 20:09.770
Okay,well,as your financial
advisor,listen to me now.

20:09.770 --> 20:11.380
This place is perfect.

20:11.380 --> 20:14.180
Look at the room it's got. You know what
scotty and i would give for that much room?

20:14.530 --> 20:15.760
Think of the parties we could throw.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.190
Why would I want to throw parties
for families with sick children?

20:18.530 --> 20:19.890
Look at that kitchen.
Scotty would love it.

20:19.890 --> 20:21.640
I'm not buying this for scty.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.730
$675,000. New bidder,$675,000...

20:23.730 --> 20:25.130
no,but I could.

20:25.530 --> 20:26.240
What?

20:26.240 --> 20:29.140
I could totally do it. I could sell
the loft. I could dip into my savings.

20:29.670 --> 20:31.380
- Thank you,there.Got you.$700,000.
- I could make this work.

20:31.780 --> 20:34.640
Well,g-god knows it's--
it's a decent price.

20:35.070 --> 20:37.030
- do i hear $725,000?
- $725,000.

20:37.030 --> 20:38.800
$725,000,new bidder. Thank you.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.590
- Kevin walker.
- He says yes at $725,000.

20:40.590 --> 20:42.340
Do I hear $750,000?

20:42.950 --> 20:44.050
$725,000 going once...

20:44.050 --> 20:45.030
I can't believe you.

20:45.030 --> 20:45.810
Twice...

20:45.810 --> 20:47.930
you can't just snatch this
house right out from under...

20:48.710 --> 20:49.420
sold.

20:50.060 --> 20:50.990
Me.

20:54.270 --> 20:55.100
all right.

20:55.460 --> 20:56.930
Eenatopia? I
mean,I just--

20:56.930 --> 20:58.970
you know,it's not the strongest
of names,I don't think.

20:58.970 --> 21:01.910
And it doesn't really speak
to what your clientele wants.

21:01.910 --> 21:03.720
I mean,greenatopia?

21:03.720 --> 21:07.250
What-- what about
something like,um,organica?

21:07.910 --> 21:08.360
But--

21:08.360 --> 21:10.560
ooh,you know what? That's
not a bad idea,sarah.

21:10.890 --> 21:12.260
You know,everything's in the name.

21:12.260 --> 21:14.150
I happen to like greenatopia.

21:16.030 --> 21:17.850
I'm gonna get the door.
Thanks for your feedback.

21:18.690 --> 21:20.410
Tommy,would you make sure
the house doesn't burn down?

21:20.410 --> 21:22.910
You know,one time...

21:23.470 --> 21:26.530
I went to thanksgiving dinner at a
friend's house,and the oven caught fire.

21:27.360 --> 21:30.590
Do you have any idea how far grease
can splatter from a flaming turkey?

21:33.550 --> 21:35.490
hi there. Come in.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.670
Mwah. Hey.

21:37.080 --> 21:37.770
What--

21:37.770 --> 21:39.550
- hey.
- Congratulations,honey.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.600
Oh. oh,so well-deserved.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.120
Thank you for having me. I can't
tell you how much it means to me.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.620
Well,it is my pleasure,really.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.240
Hors d'oeuvres? Would you like a drink?

21:47.240 --> 21:48.640
- Yeah.
- Everybody's on the way.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.690
Paul,however,is,um,already here.

21:52.230 --> 21:53.400
Well,at least he's punctual.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.820
Uh,no,no,no,not punctual. Early.

21:56.310 --> 21:58.260
Very,very early.

21:58.870 --> 22:00.740
You and i will be having words.

22:01.670 --> 22:02.690
Justin.

22:03.020 --> 22:04.020
Paul. There he is.

22:04.260 --> 22:05.530
What's going on,man? Good to see you.

22:05.530 --> 22:06.000
all right. Welcome.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.150
Who's paul?

22:07.150 --> 22:08.660
Friend of justin'S.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.710
He thought it would be a good
idea to set paul up with saul.

22:11.710 --> 22:12.670
Really?

22:13.250 --> 22:15.600
becca,this is,uh,paul. This
is my girlfriend rebecca.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.290
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh,nice to meet you.

22:17.290 --> 22:19.330
And here's the,uh,the
man of the hour,scotty.

22:19.330 --> 22:22.020
Oh,congratulations on your promotion.

22:22.020 --> 22:22.670
Thank you.

22:22.670 --> 22:24.560
I'll be honest with you. I've
never eaten in your restaurant.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.730
I'm afraid the food's
probably a bit too rich for me.

22:26.730 --> 22:28.500
I know it's too rich
for my bank balance.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.360
Oh,sorry.

22:31.170 --> 22:32.590
no.

22:32.590 --> 22:33.370
Hey,guys.

22:33.370 --> 22:37.040
Hey,paul,you gotta tell scotty that
story about you and your first boyfriend.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.340
Oh,my god. You'll love that.

22:38.340 --> 22:39.730
Come on. Come on.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.770
You are so not as funny as you think.

22:45.840 --> 22:50.660
You know,maybe the four of us should just sit down when
ethan and kyle get back,and we can have a revamping session.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.910
You know,if you keep eating that
cheese,you're gonna ruin the whole platter.

22:54.330 --> 22:57.400
Calm down,sarah. It's only
a couple of pieces of cheese.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.210
No,it starts with a couple of pieces.

22:59.210 --> 23:01.690
Then you want another and another
and another,and before you know it,

23:01.690 --> 23:04.420
the whole platter will be ruined,and
it was perfect to begin with.

23:05.120 --> 23:05.850
Hey,ladies.

23:08.070 --> 23:11.570
You know,my mom used to
throw fabulous dinner parties.

23:11.570 --> 23:13.260
Oh,that's nice.

23:14.710 --> 23:17.360
See,my dad left us when
she was pregnant with me,

23:17.360 --> 23:19.950
so I guess she needed something
to distract from all that pain.

23:21.070 --> 23:21.860
Oh,that's so sad.

23:21.860 --> 23:24.940
You know what? I'm gonna take this out to the living
room because people are starting to get hungry.

23:24.940 --> 23:25.900
Oh,you know what? Let me help.

23:25.900 --> 23:26.390
No,no,no. No,no,no.

23:26.390 --> 23:28.430
- That's okay. - No,I got it. I
got-- I got these ones. I got these.

23:31.180 --> 23:32.530
- Oh,hey,mom.
- Hi,honey.

23:32.690 --> 23:35.410
Sorry we're late. I saw
uncle saul is driving up.

23:35.410 --> 23:36.120
Uh-huh.

23:36.120 --> 23:36.900
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:36.900 --> 23:38.040
Is scotty here?

23:38.040 --> 23:39.320
- He's in the living room.
- Great.

23:42.060 --> 23:42.950
Is everything all right?

23:42.950 --> 23:44.800
No,everything is not all right.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.940
I was all set to go to the
auction today and to buy a house,

23:47.940 --> 23:51.140
but kevin had to go with me to make
sure I didn't get myself into trouble,

23:51.140 --> 23:54.840
and then he completely undermined all
my plans,dominated the whole procedure,

23:54.840 --> 23:57.500
and to top it all off,he bought
a house right out from under me.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.980
I'd like to strangle him

23:58.980 --> 24:00.760
kevin bought a house?

24:01.090 --> 24:04.660
Kevin didn't buy a house. Kevin
bought a mansion,my mansion.

24:04.660 --> 24:05.710
W.

24:06.360 --> 24:09.400
Well,if it's any consolation,I'm
at the strangling point with kitty.

24:09.850 --> 24:12.550
My proposal was perfect. It was great.

24:12.550 --> 24:17.620
I-- it was genius until kitty
morphed into some,like,evil professor.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.770
- Did it distract her?
- I guess.

24:19.770 --> 24:21.140
Mission accomplished.

24:21.140 --> 24:23.390
Sarah,these canap閟 are amazing.

24:23.390 --> 24:24.350
Thank you.

24:24.810 --> 24:25.710
oh,my god.

24:25.710 --> 24:27.350
You must be justin's mother.

24:27.350 --> 24:28.550
Oh,I
fe-- oh.

24:29.840 --> 24:32.890
you know what? He speaks about you so often
in our meetings,I feel like I already know you.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.100
You know,we have similar taste in men.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.290
I-I mean,I just go from
one cheater to another.

24:38.430 --> 24:39.930
But I'm interrupting. I'm sorry.

24:39.930 --> 24:41.930
You-- you
continue. Okay.

24:43.930 --> 24:44.980
Great.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.630
Who the hell is that?

24:48.580 --> 24:49.970
That would be paul.

24:51.400 --> 24:54.340
I have got the best surprise
in the history of surprises.

24:54.720 --> 24:55.990
- Is it a
puppy? - Mnh-mnh.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.230
It's a little better than a puppy.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.110
Hey,everybody. The party can start.

25:00.110 --> 25:01.180
Uncle saul.

25:01.180 --> 25:01.930
Hey.

25:02.260 --> 25:03.610
- This is gonna be interesting.
- It's gonna be great.

25:03.610 --> 25:05.740
- Paul,saul's here.
- Paul?

25:05.740 --> 25:07.770
Uh,uncle saul,I want you
to meet my good friend paul.

25:07.770 --> 25:09.080
Paul,this is saul.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.270
Quite the "road to
damascus" moment,isn't it?

25:11.270 --> 25:12.490
I'm--
I'm sorry.

25:12.490 --> 25:14.430
I've heard so much about you.

25:15.070 --> 25:16.690
I've heard absolutely nothing about you.

25:16.690 --> 25:17.730
Don't worry. You will.

25:17.730 --> 25:20.530
Well,we could remedy that right
now. Would you like to have a chat?

25:20.760 --> 25:22.590
Hmm? Come on. Come on.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.180
so...

25:27.990 --> 25:28.770
wow.

25:28.770 --> 25:31.320
So how do you think it's going? I mean,they've
been talking for,like,20 minutes straight.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.810
Well,actually,paul's been talking
for,like,20 minutes. Saul looks miserable.

25:34.870 --> 25:36.410
No,no. Saul always looks like that.

25:36.410 --> 25:37.880
Look,paul's a nice guy.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.680
Justin,some of his stories have
permanently scarred my brain.

25:40.680 --> 25:41.540
He's really open.

25:41.540 --> 25:46.220
I know his entire medical history,from ringworm in
grade school to having his overzealous ear wax irrigated.

25:46.220 --> 25:47.960
He is not open. He's an oversharer.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.020
Justin,we need to talk.

25:50.860 --> 25:52.740
Ohbe kind. He meant well.

25:54.130 --> 25:55.810
All right,justin. Just tell
me what you were thinking.

25:56.310 --> 25:59.870
Here's an older gay man,and oh,my uncle is
an older gay man. They'd be perfect together.

25:59.870 --> 26:01.610
He's also got really
nice hair,which I know--

26:01.610 --> 26:02.720
not funny,justin.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.280
I'm sorry,uncle saul,all right? But
maybe you're not giving him a chance.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.250
I mean,he's a really smart
guy. He used to be a doctor.

26:07.250 --> 26:08.670
Where did you meet him?

26:08.670 --> 26:10.180
I met him at N.A.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.430
Hey,guys. Dinner's ready.

26:13.970 --> 26:15.330
We are not finished.

26:16.550 --> 26:18.450
This chair is kind of a butt killer.

26:18.780 --> 26:22.460
Oh,yeah,sarah. We're gonna have to get you some
new chairs before you have another dinner party.

26:22.870 --> 26:24.970
Thank you,kitty. I'll be
sure to take care of that.

26:25.410 --> 26:27.490
in my apartnt,everything is overstuffed.

26:27.820 --> 26:30.790
Wh it comes to furniture,I think the
bigger and the puffier,the better.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.390
What about you,saul?

26:32.820 --> 26:35.710
Well,no,actually,I-I-- I
tend to like cleaner lines.

26:36.310 --> 26:39.790
Oh,I guess-- I guess paul just needs a
little more padding than uncle saul,huh?

26:42.750 --> 26:44.390
tommy,could you pass the wine,please?

26:44.390 --> 26:44.980
yeah.

26:44.980 --> 26:46.740
uh,before we all start,

26:46.740 --> 26:51.610
I would like to propose a toast
to our guest of honor,scotty.

26:52.100 --> 26:53.880
So if you'd raise your glasses...

26:54.470 --> 26:57.130
to scotty,who we love and

26:57.620 --> 27:01.720
who we wish only the best with all
the success that is coming his way.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.640
Thank you. And thank you all.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.380
I am so proud to be a
member of this family.

27:06.380 --> 27:07.120
Oh,please. Aww.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.850
To scotty. cheers.

27:10.570 --> 27:12.620
I also have an announcement to make.

27:13.750 --> 27:16.720
Scotty,I love you so much

27:17.130 --> 27:20.850
anwant nothing more than to make
you happy and to provide you with...

27:21.820 --> 27:23.310
the life you deserve.

27:24.150 --> 27:25.810
And so to that end...

27:26.730 --> 27:28.150
I went out and...

27:28.650 --> 27:30.680
bought you a little something today.

27:35.810 --> 27:37.900
I bought us a house...

27:38.350 --> 27:39.090
this house.

27:39.090 --> 27:40.460
oh,my god. wow.

27:42.950 --> 27:45.080
Are-- are you
gonna say something?

27:45.990 --> 27:47.710
Nora,I thought you were the
one that was gonna buy a house.

27:47.710 --> 27:49.150
Yes,so did I.

27:49.150 --> 27:52.000
You know,if I bought a house
without talking to my boyfriend,

27:52.000 --> 27:55.560
he would have tarred and
feathered and left me for dead.

27:57.360 --> 27:58.670
Um...

27:59.700 --> 28:01.270
will you excuse me?

28:01.600 --> 28:02.900
Scotty,to--

28:08.050 --> 28:09.880
I think he's a little... overwhelmed.

28:10.550 --> 28:12.280
Over-- no.
No,kevin.

28:12.630 --> 28:14.310
He feels bulldozed.

28:15.380 --> 28:16.620
I'm sorry. What are you talking about?

28:16.620 --> 28:18.520
Because you know what? I was
just trying to make him happy.

28:18.520 --> 28:19.730
No,no.

28:19.730 --> 28:24.030
Y-you just don't believe anyone
can succeed without your help.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.640
There you go,kevin walker
to the rescue. You know what?

28:27.100 --> 28:31.170
Maybe some people would really
like to do things without your helP.

28:31.170 --> 28:34.280
Maybe we don't want to be rescued. Maybe
we'd like you to mind your own business.

28:34.280 --> 28:39.020
I think you're being really unfair,because you always said
how happy you were en dad surprised you with our house.

28:39.020 --> 28:40.750
- Your dad the cheater?
- Not now,pauL.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.310
I pretended to be happy.

28:43.310 --> 28:47.080
God,all the years I pretended to
be happy with what was handed to me,

28:47.080 --> 28:51.570
as if it was inconceivable I might
actually have an opinion of my own.

28:52.120 --> 28:52.960
You know what?

28:52.960 --> 28:58.740
The men in this family need to learn they can't barge
into every situation like a bull in a china shop,

28:58.740 --> 29:01.490
thinking they can  fix
everything themselves.

29:01.850 --> 29:04.640
If you would actually try
to communicate for a change,

29:04.640 --> 29:07.720
then you would learn,scotty didn't
want you to buy a house forim.

29:07.720 --> 29:11.230
And I didn't want your help
at that damn auction today.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.100
Sarah,this is lovely.

29:20.100 --> 29:22.370
Stay...

29:22.370 --> 29:25.020
long enough to actually eat anything.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.110
WoW.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.120
Dinner and a show.

29:36.410 --> 29:37.630
Well,that was fun.

29:37.630 --> 29:38.790
Yeah.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.020
you think you could keep
these up on a higher shelf?

29:43.620 --> 29:45.950
You want me to get you
a chair to stand on?

29:46.410 --> 29:47.510
No,I got it.

29:47.510 --> 29:49.780
I just hope that paige and
cooper like veal piccata,

29:49.780 --> 29:52.530
because they're gonna be
eating it for the next month.

29:52.980 --> 29:55.140
By the way,I got these great containers.

29:55.140 --> 29:57.280
They just snap. They're so easy.

29:57.280 --> 30:00.130
Oh. Now you're criticizing
my food storage.

30:00.130 --> 30:04.100
Oh,okay. Clearly you're mad because I
gave you some notes on your proposal.

30:04.100 --> 30:05.850
They weren't notes. You disemboweled it.

30:05.850 --> 30:09.270
You know,why did you ask me to
read it if you didn't want mypinion?

30:09.270 --> 30:11.120
Because we were trying to distract you.

30:12.830 --> 30:14.110
What are you talking about?

30:14.110 --> 30:15.880
Dis--we?
Who's we?

30:15.880 --> 30:18.530
Robert,the family,me.

30:19.270 --> 30:20.880
We were worried about you.

30:21.590 --> 30:24.530
We just,you know,used the
proposal as a way to...

30:25.210 --> 30:27.190
take your mind off what happened.

30:28.780 --> 30:30.680
God,sarah. You can't even say it.

30:31.890 --> 30:33.340
Just say it. I can say it.

30:33.750 --> 30:36.130
I scared away our birth
mother. I lost us a baby.

30:38.320 --> 30:44.500
W-why didn't you guys just ask me how I was feeling instead
of this convoluted plan to get my mind off of things?

30:44.500 --> 30:48.540
Well,to be fair,kitty,you didn't really
seem like you wanted to talk about it.

30:48.540 --> 30:51.690
Well,no,no,of course I didn'T.
I still don'T. It's painful.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.900
And all of you scheming to keep me
occupied isn't gonna change that.

30:57.020 --> 31:00.440
A-and just for the
record,your plan didn't work.

31:00.440 --> 31:04.810
The whole time that I was revising your stupid
proposal,I was beating myself up about trish.

31:05.590 --> 31:08.640
Hey,it doesn't matter how
much I try to keep myself busy.

31:08.640 --> 31:11.290
It's not gonna stop me from going
through what I'm going through.

31:12.230 --> 31:15.240
I screwed up,plain and simple. It'S...

31:16.450 --> 31:18.630
it's just something I'm
gonna have to deal with.

31:20.970 --> 31:23.240
I can't imagine what
you're feeling,kitty.

31:23.650 --> 31:24.550
Well,I'M...

31:25.670 --> 31:27.950
I'm feeling pretty lousy,actually.

31:28.470 --> 31:31.350
Well,that's fair,but
you're gonna get past this.

31:31.850 --> 31:33.160
You're gonna get picked again.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.730
You don't know that,and neither do I.

31:34.730 --> 31:40.290
No,but I have faith,and I know that whatever
pain all this is causing is worth it.

31:40.920 --> 31:45.220
The moment you have your child,you'll
be so grateful for every screwup,

31:45.220 --> 31:49.190
every disappointment,all the
uncertainty because in the end,it--

31:49.190 --> 31:53.710
it's all led you to your
daughter or your son.

31:56.530 --> 31:57.970
I hope you're right.

31:59.970 --> 32:01.120
I am.

32:04.660 --> 32:05.870
well,thank you.

32:06.270 --> 32:10.200
But maybe next time,instead of distracting
me,you could try something else?

32:10.860 --> 32:11.930
Like what?

32:12.740 --> 32:13.940
Hugs are good.

32:15.790 --> 32:16.800
wow.

32:17.950 --> 32:20.670
Okay,note to
self-- hug first...

32:21.780 --> 32:23.210
proofread later.

32:24.350 --> 32:25.610
Oh,come here.

32:30.690 --> 32:31.970
I love you,kitty.

32:31.970 --> 32:33.420
Mm,I love you,too.

32:35.220 --> 32:37.790
Was my proposal really that bad?

32:39.560 --> 32:41.800
Uh,less talking,more hugging.

32:49.660 --> 32:50.600
okay.

32:51.420 --> 32:52.710
- HeY.
- Justin.

32:53.860 --> 32:54.710
Hey.

32:56.020 --> 32:56.840
- I,uh-- -
how are you?

32:56.840 --> 33:00.390
I just-- I just wanted to see if,uh,you made
it back all right after driving paul home.

33:00.390 --> 33:01.830
That was not part of
the plan,uncle saul.

33:01.830 --> 33:04.730
It's okay. It's fine. Come on in

33:04.730 --> 33:05.500
yeah.

33:05.500 --> 33:06.470
Sit down.

33:08.300 --> 33:11.140
The truth is,I didn't have the heart
to tell him to take the bus home.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.370
Anyway...

33:13.870 --> 33:15.170
paul's not that bad.

33:15.480 --> 33:16.470
Oh,so you gonna call him again?

33:16.470 --> 33:19.420
Are you out of your mind? Not
if he was the last gay man alive.

33:21.490 --> 33:24.420
Look,I,uh,I just wanted to
say I'm sorry,uncle saul.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.260
Please. You don't have
to apologize,justin.

33:26.260 --> 33:28.850
Actually,I was-- I was
very touched by the gesture.

33:29.480 --> 33:32.000
But I think that you should
interfere in your own life.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.660
Well,it's easier to butt into
other people's lives. I mean...

33:35.960 --> 33:38.500
you know,figuring out what I
want to do for myself,that's--

33:39.110 --> 33:40.330
that's where the headache comes.

33:40.330 --> 33:42.350
Yeah,well,take an aspirin and start.

33:42.950 --> 33:46.370
Look,you shouldn't be wasting your
talents trying to set up your uncle.

33:47.150 --> 33:50.480
Well,I guess we can cross
"matchmaker" off my future career list.

33:50.860 --> 33:51.710
That's a good idea.

33:52.550 --> 33:56.350
Look,if I tell you something,can
I trust you to be discreet?

33:57.130 --> 33:58.570
Yeah. What's--
what's going on?

33:58.570 --> 33:59.880
If you tell anyone,I'll
never forgive you.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.920
I cross my heart and
hope to die,all right?

34:03.710 --> 34:05.560
- I'm seeing someone.
- You are?

34:05.560 --> 34:08.710
It's early stages,and I really
care about this man a great deal,

34:08.710 --> 34:15.310
which is why I don't want to bring the
relationship into the whole walker clan just yet.

34:15.310 --> 34:17.120
Yeah,that's a--
that's a smart move.

34:17.750 --> 34:18.889
Lips are sealed.

34:19.530 --> 34:20.400
Okay.

34:27.639 --> 34:28.340
hey.

34:29.739 --> 34:30.679
kevin,we gotta talk.

34:30.679 --> 34:34.420
Oh,what,storming out of sarah's house in the middle
of dinner wasn't communicative enough for you?

34:34.420 --> 34:35.949
I didn't feel like making a scene.

34:35.949 --> 34:38.310
Well,you did. You just
didn't stick around to see it.

34:39.170 --> 34:43.530
I,on the other hand,had to sit there while my mother
screamed at me for being,oh,what did she say? Too controlling.

34:43.530 --> 34:46.050
Well,you're definitely in control of
our finances. I mean,look at these--

34:46.050 --> 34:49.250
gas,electric,even the magazine
subscriptions-- they're all in your name.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.159
Transfer them into your name.
You think I like paying for them?

34:51.159 --> 34:53.360
I'm starting to think you do.

34:53.360 --> 34:56.030
I'm starting to think you're only comfortable
in this relationship being the provider.

34:56.030 --> 34:58.180
Oh! Here we go again.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.250
What is that supposed to mean?

34:59.250 --> 35:04.670
Just because my father surprised my mother with a
new house,and I catastrophically did the same thing,

35:04.670 --> 35:06.680
it doesn't make us the same person.

35:06.680 --> 35:07.790
I never said you were.

35:07.790 --> 35:09.170
Yeah? Well,my mother sure as hell did.

35:09.170 --> 35:11.860
Well,that's her problem with
your dad. My problem is with you.

35:11.860 --> 35:14.380
Oh,wow. For a second,I
was actually relieved.

35:17.440 --> 35:20.460
kevin,d-do you not want me to succeed?

35:20.460 --> 35:23.980
How can you even ask me that
when all I've done is support you?

35:23.980 --> 35:25.510
When I was down,yes,you did.

35:25.510 --> 35:27.160
Well,is there some
accusation lurking in there?

35:27.160 --> 35:29.750
Because maybe you'd like to tell me what's
wrong with supporting someone you love--

35:29.750 --> 35:31.890
nothing,but this feels competitive.

35:31.890 --> 35:33.660
What's competit--
you-- you and me?

35:33.660 --> 35:36.530
Why else,in the middle of a
party celebrating my success,

35:36.530 --> 35:40.730
would you decide to announce,in front
of everybody,that you bought me a house?

35:40.730 --> 35:43.720
Us. I bought us a house to
prove how proud I was of you.

35:43.720 --> 35:46.940
No,you bought a house to make yourself feel
better. You wanted to change the headline.

35:46.940 --> 35:47.650
You're crazy.

35:47.650 --> 35:48.310
- Am i?
- Yeah.

35:48.310 --> 35:51.210
Kevin,when I was living in my car,you
were more than willing to come to my rescue

35:51.210 --> 35:53.210
because you love being
the big,successful man.

35:53.210 --> 35:54.870
But guess what? Things have changed.

35:54.870 --> 35:56.850
Do you honestly think
I want you to fail?

35:56.850 --> 35:59.560
I think it threatens you
to feel like I'm your equal.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.000
oh,man.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.480
okay.

36:07.850 --> 36:10.390
You want to know what my
financial hiccup yesterday was?

36:12.020 --> 36:13.600
I am now officially...

36:14.340 --> 36:17.380
making a quarter of what I used to.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.920
A month ago,I was
about to become partner.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.350
Now I am a low-paid
government employee.

36:23.460 --> 36:25.110
You want to make changes
in people's lives.

36:25.110 --> 36:26.850
What if can't even
make a change to ours?

36:28.510 --> 36:30.770
scotty,you did keep
saying you wanted to move.

36:31.330 --> 36:32.320
I didn't mean now.

36:32.320 --> 36:37.310
I meant in a year or two when I've saved
money and we can buy a house together.

36:41.070 --> 36:42.720
you know what? I'M...

36:43.790 --> 36:45.190
I'm sorry. I just...

36:46.480 --> 36:51.540
I guess I wanted to still prove that I
could do that,that i could take care of you,

36:51.540 --> 36:54.220
and if I couldn't,then...

36:54.430 --> 36:56.120
why would you even love me?

36:57.550 --> 37:01.850
Kevin,I don't love you because of how much money
you make or because you can take care of me.

37:01.850 --> 37:05.750
I love you because your hrt is
bigger than your very annoying brain.

37:06.530 --> 37:09.320
And if even if you do want to be
competitive with me,it wouldn't make sense...

37:10.790 --> 37:13.180
because you're the
reason I am who I am now.

37:14.210 --> 37:15.380
Wow.

37:16.570 --> 37:18.650
I didn't realize how amazing I was.

37:20.580 --> 37:22.160
That's exactly right.

37:24.530 --> 37:26.170
I really did want to surprise you.

37:26.850 --> 37:27.830
You did.

37:28.670 --> 37:32.210
but,um,next time,make it
something that we can both enjoy.

37:53.200 --> 37:56.850
what,it's not bad enough you buy
this house right out from under me,

37:56.850 --> 37:59.560
but you insist I come
over so you can gloat?

37:59.560 --> 38:01.120
Would you please just come inside?

38:01.390 --> 38:03.740
What is so important you
couldn't tell me on the phone?

38:03.740 --> 38:06.190
I've gotta get on the freeway
at this time of the day.

38:06.190 --> 38:07.710
It's
incredibly-- ooh.

38:08.730 --> 38:09.940
It's awfully musty in here.

38:09.940 --> 38:12.890
Yeah,well,I hope you can get used to it.

38:14.870 --> 38:15.470
What do you mean?

38:15.470 --> 38:17.470
What I mean is,this is your house,mom,

38:17.470 --> 38:20.820
and I'm really,really very sorry
about what happened at the auction.

38:21.040 --> 38:24.380
You know,look,'s a long-standing
walker tradition to overstep,

38:25.780 --> 38:28.300
and I was acting like dad,and
that's not something I want to do.

38:29.380 --> 38:31.770
Oh,kev. I'm sorry,too.

38:31.770 --> 38:35.460
Honestly,I should've stuck to my
guns. I-I should've said something.

38:35.460 --> 38:37.970
I-I should've gone to
the auction by myself.

38:39.130 --> 38:40.660
Does this mean we're okay?

38:40.660 --> 38:43.840
I-I stand by a lot of the
things i said yesterday,just...

38:44.730 --> 38:46.300
not how I said them.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.480
Yes. We're okay.

38:48.950 --> 38:49.870
Great.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.310
You want to take the keys? My
arm's getting kind of tired.

38:55.360 --> 38:57.050
I don't know. It is awfully big.

38:57.050 --> 39:00.340
Yes,it is,but think of all the good
you c do with a place like this.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.340
Going twice...

39:05.670 --> 39:06.800
oh,god.

39:07.030 --> 39:10.200
Is this actually happening?
Am i really buying this house?

39:10.200 --> 39:13.430
I really hope so,'cause it'll go a long
way to patching things up with my husband

39:13.430 --> 39:15.880
if I can tell him I ditched the mansion.

39:16.620 --> 39:18.710
Holy crap. I just bought a house.

39:18.710 --> 39:20.250
congtulations.

39:20.250 --> 39:21.920
Oh,gosh!

39:22.560 --> 39:26.910
now before  president-elect barack obama
moves into the white house  on january 20th

39:26.910 --> 39:28.780
and takes over the
leadership  of the country...

39:30.530 --> 39:31.630
- hey.
- Oh,hey.

39:32.970 --> 39:36.080
You do know that our anniversary
isn't until next month,rit?

39:36.530 --> 39:37.340
Yes.

39:37.720 --> 39:40.530
Uh,the card  from the kids.

39:40.530 --> 39:42.680
They miss yo and the
flowers are from me.

39:42.680 --> 39:43.800
Aww.

39:45.180 --> 39:46.010
Thank you.

39:48.050 --> 39:51.180
The news is on. Does that
mean that we' feeling better?

39:51.180 --> 39:54.100
A little,no thanks to
"operation distract kitty.”

39:54.100 --> 39:57.560
Uh,oh,yes,I-- well,I figured
that you'd hear about that.

39:58.350 --> 39:59.950
Upon韆um,it didn't go well?

39:59.950 --> 40:02.210
Mm,it was an unmitigated disaster.

40:02.670 --> 40:03.520
sorry.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.280
Well,no,no,don't be sorry.

40:06.280 --> 40:07.840
I'm the one that owes you an apology.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.730
I mean,if it weren't for me,we
would be decorating the nursery.

40:10.730 --> 40:13.970
Oh,we're gonna get a baby. We're
just not gonna get it from trish.

40:14.790 --> 40:16.280
Someone's gonna choose us.

40:16.280 --> 40:17.760
I know. I just...

40:17.760 --> 40:20.720
I promise,no more shutting you out.

40:21.730 --> 40:22.880
Okay. Great.

40:22.880 --> 40:26.680
Well,then let's start with you telling
me about the infamous spandex debacle.

40:29.210 --> 40:30.460
I'm gonna kill 'em.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.640
okay,we didn't drive far enough
for it to be casa del mar.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.730
Ooh,I'm guessing the standard,right?

40:36.730 --> 40:37.720
Keep guessing.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.460
I feel like we should have a safe word.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.460
Oh,funny you should
mention the word "safe.”

40:43.020 --> 40:44.280
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

40:49.770 --> 40:50.940
We're at a bank?

40:52.270 --> 40:52.860
In pasadena?

40:52.860 --> 40:55.040
Yeah,I drove a real big loop
on the freeway to fool you,

40:55.040 --> 40:58.440
because now we have an appointment
with brett,our personal banker,

40:58.440 --> 40:59.860
who's gonna help us
open our joint accounts.

40:59.860 --> 41:00.980
You are so cute.

41:00.980 --> 41:02.830
Then we go to casa del mar.

41:02.830 --> 41:05.450
Ooh,scratch cute. You
are drop-dead sexy.

41:05.700 --> 41:07.340
- Did I do good?
- Very good.

41:07.770 --> 41:09.430
- I love you.
- I love you.

41:09.590 --> 41:13.230
Love,love,love
