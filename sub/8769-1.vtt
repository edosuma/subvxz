00:28.761 --> 00:31.180
<i>Welcome to Hazzard County.</i>

00:31.347 --> 00:35.017
<i>A little corner of the world where
everyone knows everyone else...</i>

00:35.184 --> 00:38.563
<i>... and people are never too busy
to stop and say howdy.</i>

00:38.729 --> 00:42.900
<i>Shoot, some folks even say this is
where the apple pie was invented.</i>

00:44.068 --> 00:49.198
<i>Yep, basically everything down here
moves a little bit slower...</i>

00:49.532 --> 00:55.037
<i>... unless, of course,
your last name is Duke.</i>

01:14.432 --> 01:16.476
Man, the General's in good shape.

01:16.642 --> 01:21.689
Bo, it's happy hour at The Boar's Nest,
and we still got two deliveries to make.

01:21.856 --> 01:26.194
It's all one big happy hour, Luke.
Besides, we're taking a shortcut.

01:45.254 --> 01:47.048
Hi, Luke.

01:48.508 --> 01:51.511
- I got this one.
- You sure that's a good idea, cuz?

01:51.677 --> 01:53.596
It's a great idea. Come on.

01:57.391 --> 01:58.976
Hey, Laurie.

01:59.185 --> 02:02.021
- You here to make your delivery?
- Well, I was hoping to.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.482
Luke, remember last time.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.359
Don't worry about it, cuz.

02:06.526 --> 02:09.027
It's okay, Bo. Pa ain't here.

02:09.195 --> 02:12.240
See, Bo? Pa ain't here.

02:14.117 --> 02:16.411
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:18.621 --> 02:20.206
Play hard to get, little buddy.

02:32.135 --> 02:33.886
Listen and learn, General.

02:34.053 --> 02:38.015
<i>And now, side two
of the Al Unser, Jr. story:</i>

02:38.224 --> 02:43.229
<i>No Questions, Only Unsers,
as read by Laurence Fishburne.</i>

02:43.396 --> 02:45.481
<i>"I'm too old for this shit."</i>

02:45.648 --> 02:48.484
<i>That's what I was thinking
as I turned into the final lap...</i>

02:48.651 --> 02:51.195
<i>... running fourth at Talladega.</i>

02:51.404 --> 02:54.824
<i>But then it hit me.
Life is like a racetrack.</i>

02:55.032 --> 02:57.660
<i>You gotta keep going
round and round.</i>

02:57.827 --> 03:01.748
<i>- That is so true.
- Sure, sometimes you crash and burn.</i>

03:01.914 --> 03:05.334
<i>But if you don't make the turn,
you ain't never gonna learn.</i>

03:05.752 --> 03:10.590
<i>So I gripped the wheel tighter,
checked my gauges, and made my move.</i>

03:10.757 --> 03:14.177
Make my move. Give you my move.
Make it, mother...

03:14.385 --> 03:16.471
- Jesus Christ!
- Howdy, Bo.

03:16.637 --> 03:20.558
Hey, Mr. Pullman.
I nearly shit myself.

03:20.933 --> 03:22.894
- How you doing, sir?
- Oh, I'm fine.

03:23.060 --> 03:25.897
You ready for that big
Hazzard Rally this weekend?

03:26.063 --> 03:29.108
Yeah, I got him all tuned up.
Right, General?

03:29.400 --> 03:31.402
How many times
you won that, anyway?

03:31.611 --> 03:34.238
- Four in a row, sir.
- Four in a row.

03:34.447 --> 03:38.743
That's good. Billy Prickett won it four
in a row, and look what he's doing today.

03:39.452 --> 03:41.829
- Hey, you been hunting?
- Yes, sir.

03:41.996 --> 03:44.540
Yeah, I been using
those new whammy shells.

03:44.707 --> 03:48.044
They scatter less for when you really
wanna blow a hole in something.

03:50.922 --> 03:53.591
- Cool. Guns.
- Yeah.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.678
Are you delivering
all by yourself today?

03:57.845 --> 03:59.847
Oh, no. I never travel alone, sir.

04:00.014 --> 04:02.391
I like to think I travel
with the man upstairs.

04:03.643 --> 04:05.103
You know, Jesus.

04:06.771 --> 04:09.315
You know, I like that attitude.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.776
I'm gonna look around
and find a boy like you...

04:11.984 --> 04:14.487
...to date my daughter,
Laurie, pretty soon.

04:14.654 --> 04:17.656
Because she's getting curious
about boys, you know.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.117
Yeah.

04:19.325 --> 04:21.994
Oh, you're talking about sex, right?

04:22.495 --> 04:25.957
I just wanna keep that
sorry cousin of yours away from her.

04:26.124 --> 04:29.794
The way he looks at her galls me.
You know what I mean?

04:31.254 --> 04:33.714
You get back here right now,
you son of a bitch.

04:33.881 --> 04:35.591
Get back here.

04:35.758 --> 04:38.136
Luke! Luke!

04:38.302 --> 04:41.472
- Why you running, you chickenshit?
- Goddamn Dukes.

04:41.639 --> 04:43.266
You get the hell off my sister.

04:43.433 --> 04:45.226
- Jimmy!
- Oh, shit.

04:45.393 --> 04:48.354
Damn you, Luke!
You get back in the house!

04:48.521 --> 04:50.898
- Go, Bo, go!
- Luke, wait!

04:51.065 --> 04:53.693
- Put on a shirt!
- Come on, come on, come on.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.820
I forgot about the brother. Go!

05:00.324 --> 05:01.784
So happy hour?

05:01.993 --> 05:04.829
- You're gonna get us shot someday.
- Not today.

05:04.996 --> 05:07.498
Not with you driving the getaway car.

05:09.876 --> 05:12.336
- So how was it?
- It's never bad.

05:15.631 --> 05:17.300
Son of a bitch.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.762
Here, load up with these
whammy shells.

05:20.928 --> 05:23.222
They'll blow a hole through
an elephant's ass.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.516
Look out.

05:30.021 --> 05:32.315
Oh, goddamn it!
You're gonna replace that.

05:34.275 --> 05:36.360
- What's he using?
- You don't wanna know.

05:36.569 --> 05:39.155
Dadgum it,
you just assassinated a tree.

05:39.322 --> 05:40.865
Got a big kick to it.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.951
Don't you worry. They can't touch
the General. Come on, boy.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.211
You missed, Jimmy!

05:53.377 --> 05:57.590
Can't you shoot straight? Don't point
that thing at me, you chucklehead.

05:57.757 --> 06:00.384
Don't call me a chucklehead.
I ain't a chucklehead.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.596
Hey! Get that gun out of the wheel!

06:04.263 --> 06:06.641
What are you doing? Hey.
Hey. What the hell?

06:07.058 --> 06:08.726
- Goddamn it.
- I'm sorry, Daddy.

06:08.893 --> 06:10.770
Let's go after them.

06:12.688 --> 06:15.900
- Bo, did you see that sign?
- I can read!

06:16.109 --> 06:18.194
This is how you planned
on losing them?

06:18.361 --> 06:19.862
You ain't scared, are you?

06:20.029 --> 06:23.074
Scared? Hell, no. I just don't
wanna hear it from Uncle Jesse...

06:23.241 --> 06:25.493
...when you break his bottles of shine.

06:25.660 --> 06:28.287
I bet you the old phone book
I don't break a bottle.

06:28.454 --> 06:30.248
Phone book it is.

06:30.456 --> 06:34.085
Daddy, you get me close,
and I'll put a bullet in this son of a bitch.

06:36.838 --> 06:39.132
Goddamn it, Jimmy!

06:39.298 --> 06:42.844
Who says I can't shoot? Daddy? Daddy!

07:03.281 --> 07:06.159
<i>Bo and Luke Duke.</i>

07:06.325 --> 07:08.745
<i>Cousins closer than brothers.</i>

07:08.911 --> 07:11.122
<i>Both big-hearted, strong-willed...</i>

07:11.330 --> 07:14.709
<i>... and restless as a couple of cats
thrown into a swimming hole.</i>

07:41.778 --> 07:43.237
Nice driving, cuz.

07:47.325 --> 07:48.785
What?

07:52.371 --> 07:55.792
- I won the bet, you son of a bitch.
- Oh, come on.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.961
I didn't break any bottles,
so I won the bet.

08:03.174 --> 08:06.302
- I was just joking about the bet.
- Oh, you were joking?

08:06.469 --> 08:08.513
- Yeah.
- Still getting the phone book, though.

08:08.721 --> 08:12.558
- Come on, double or nothing.
- Nope. Time to pay your debt, buddy.

08:13.726 --> 08:15.812
Which side you want,
right side or left?

08:17.522 --> 08:19.565
Right.

08:19.732 --> 08:21.484
Did I hear one of your teeth break?

08:21.651 --> 08:24.695
I don't remember the Hazzard
phone book being that thick.

08:24.946 --> 08:27.156
This is Atlanta.

08:37.207 --> 08:41.337
Bet was over. I can't believe that
happened. I mean, the bet was over.

08:41.504 --> 08:43.381
- What are you doing?
- Where you want it?

08:44.799 --> 08:47.260
- Oh, man.
- Where you want it?

08:47.427 --> 08:48.845
Left.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.598
That was a good one.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.731
Right in the ball sack. God.

09:00.857 --> 09:03.401
In case of dehydration.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.409
That'll put lead in your pencil.

09:15.788 --> 09:19.125
- Man, I'm already tired of walking.
- You could use a little exercise.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.461
Them jeans of yours
look tighter than Daisy's.

09:21.627 --> 09:25.047
Oh, yeah? I bet you a cold beer
I could beat you to The Boar's Nest.

09:25.214 --> 09:27.216
That's five miles.

09:36.017 --> 09:38.978
I'm coming! I'm coming!

09:44.275 --> 09:45.943
Face!

09:51.866 --> 09:53.826
He came back.

09:56.037 --> 09:58.081
What's Billy Prickett doing here?

09:58.247 --> 10:00.333
Well, it looks like he's here
for the race.

10:02.752 --> 10:06.422
Man, those tires alone are worth
more than the General Lee.

10:07.507 --> 10:11.135
My, oh, my. Look at that.
Billy Prickett's car, huh?

10:11.552 --> 10:13.721
What's new
in law enforcement, Enos?

10:13.888 --> 10:17.600
- They make you lieutenant yet?
- Hell, you know that'll never happen.

10:17.767 --> 10:20.603
Maybe one of these days you'll
wise up and come work for us.

10:20.770 --> 10:22.563
We could use a man like you.

10:22.730 --> 10:26.401
I don't know. I don't think it's a good
time to be in the moonshine business.

10:26.567 --> 10:29.612
Moonshine business?
We ain't in the moonshining business.

10:31.280 --> 10:36.119
But if someone were in the moonshining
business, why would it be a bad time?

10:36.285 --> 10:39.497
Now, Luke, you know I can't say
anything. Boss Hogg'll tan my hide.

10:39.664 --> 10:41.124
He spanks you?

10:41.499 --> 10:43.835
Hey, Dil, what do you want?
We just ordered.

10:44.001 --> 10:46.921
By the looks of this place,
I'll take two bottles of Pepto...

10:47.088 --> 10:49.507
...and a shot of penicillin, right?

10:59.434 --> 11:01.394
Jesus, mother of Mary.

11:04.439 --> 11:06.941
Look away, man.
Trust me, look away.

11:07.108 --> 11:09.569
Don't worry about it.
I won't hurt her.

11:09.736 --> 11:13.364
There ain't nobody in this bar
concerned about you hurting her.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.283
All right, all right.

11:19.996 --> 11:22.165
Y'all ready to order?

11:25.084 --> 11:27.211
You better be reading
my nametag, friend.

11:27.420 --> 11:31.799
I am, I am. I noticed
your initials were double D.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.596
- Oh, sweet Jesus.
- I'll give you one more chance.

11:36.763 --> 11:39.891
You wanna order, or you wanna sit
around and make stupid jokes?

11:40.057 --> 11:42.351
Ain't gotta get fussy.
We're having a good time.

11:42.518 --> 11:45.396
I'll tell you what, I'll order.
We don't want no problems.

11:45.563 --> 11:47.774
Let's see...

11:48.775 --> 11:50.610
Do those legs come over easy?

11:50.902 --> 11:52.820
Oh, my God.

11:55.490 --> 11:58.993
- How about the special, sir?
- Dil Driscoll!

11:59.243 --> 12:02.914
You stop bothering that nice girl
and pick on somebody your own size.

12:03.122 --> 12:05.249
- Billy Prickett.
- Hey, it's Billy Prickett!

12:06.626 --> 12:08.294
- Welcome home, boy.
- You old mule.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.214
Hey.

12:13.132 --> 12:15.218
Why don't you cool off, Dil?

12:16.969 --> 12:19.972
- Come on, boy. Let's get out of here.
- My, my, my.

12:20.139 --> 12:24.727
Holy hell, Luke. There he is, right there.
That's Billy Prickett.

12:24.894 --> 12:26.437
Should I buy him a drink?

12:26.604 --> 12:29.232
Maybe you should buy him
flowers and chocolates.

12:29.399 --> 12:33.528
Give me a Miller.
Make it a LÃ¶wenbrÃ¤u.

12:34.695 --> 12:36.697
How you doing?

12:36.864 --> 12:40.034
Hey, Billy Prickett.
Welcome back to Hazzard.

12:42.245 --> 12:45.581
See, boys, I told you all the
waitresses in this place was dog ugly.

12:46.958 --> 12:49.710
- Man.
- I'm only fooling with you.

12:49.877 --> 12:51.462
Fellas, this is Bo Duke.

12:51.629 --> 12:55.675
Bo is looking to break my Hazzard Rally
record. What is it now, four in a row?

12:56.008 --> 12:57.760
Yeah, well...

12:57.927 --> 13:04.016
All streaks must come to an end, Bo.
I'm calling this one "the drive for five."

13:04.183 --> 13:07.937
- Well, I'm looking forward to the race.
- Hey, Dil!

13:08.104 --> 13:10.356
This is the boy
who's trying to break my record.

13:10.523 --> 13:13.776
Oh, really? I'm Dil Driscoll, crew chief.

13:13.943 --> 13:15.361
- Bo-Bo, have a seat.
- Really?

13:17.447 --> 13:20.491
So, Billy, what's it like
being in the circuit?

13:20.658 --> 13:22.660
- Well...
- Hey, Billy, join me for a drink?

13:22.869 --> 13:24.454
Oh, well, you sweet little thing.

13:24.620 --> 13:27.790
Fellas, I'm awfully thirsty
all of a sudden.

13:27.957 --> 13:30.376
Bo-Bo, may the best man win.

13:31.753 --> 13:33.254
John, another round!

13:33.421 --> 13:37.341
So, Bo, what's the story
on that little pistol over there?

13:37.592 --> 13:40.720
Because she gave me a ride earlier.

13:41.179 --> 13:43.765
Well, actually, she's my cousin.

13:43.931 --> 13:46.559
Oh, really? You hitting that?

13:47.393 --> 13:50.980
- She's my cousin.
- Hopefully you're kissing cousins, right?

13:52.940 --> 13:55.902
- Come again?
- Son, all I'm really trying to ask you...

13:56.069 --> 13:59.197
...is if you shuck her corn.

14:03.034 --> 14:09.082
<i>Now, there are certain things you just
don't say to a Duke about another Duke.</i>

14:13.503 --> 14:15.213
I'll shuck your corn!

14:17.715 --> 14:19.175
Excuse me a second.

14:19.342 --> 14:21.052
Pick him up! Pick him up!

14:22.929 --> 14:25.223
Hey, hey. Can I get in on this?

14:25.389 --> 14:26.641
- Yeah.
- Sure.

14:34.357 --> 14:35.900
Oh, buddy.

14:38.361 --> 14:39.862
Here we go.

14:41.989 --> 14:44.409
Fifty bucks on the Dukes!

14:58.297 --> 15:00.800
- That makes two, Luke!
- Attaboy!

15:08.975 --> 15:11.144
Hey, Billy Prickett!

15:11.394 --> 15:13.271
Careful, Bo-Bo.

15:17.024 --> 15:18.609
Don't hit him. That's A.J. Foyt!

15:18.776 --> 15:20.611
- Really?
- The fourth!

15:47.597 --> 15:50.266
- Hey, can I hit this guy?
- Kill them all!

15:53.144 --> 15:55.313
- The ribs are greasy.
- The beans are cold.

16:03.446 --> 16:06.574
<i>Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane.</i>

16:06.741 --> 16:10.411
<i>Closest thing to law enforcement
in Hazzard County.</i>

16:10.578 --> 16:14.582
<i>Rosco's been after the Duke boys
since they started walking.</i>

16:14.749 --> 16:17.376
<i>Of course, some people say
the boys' first steps...</i>

16:17.543 --> 16:21.964
<i>... landed right on the sheriff's
last nerve.</i>

16:36.145 --> 16:39.315
Dukes. Just once you two
ought to try leaving a place...

16:39.482 --> 16:42.276
...in better shape
than it was when you walked in.

16:42.443 --> 16:47.281
Oh, I think your boss can afford
to replace a few broken beer mugs.

16:47.448 --> 16:50.410
I heard there was
a little incident earlier...

16:50.576 --> 16:55.790
...concerning a certain crappy
orange hot rod out at the Miller farm.

16:56.207 --> 16:58.835
Y'all really upset some
of them construction boys.

16:59.085 --> 17:02.964
When I got there, they were not being
gentle with your beloved piece of crap.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.425
What'd you do, Rosco?

17:06.592 --> 17:10.555
I can't say she's gonna be in real good
racing shape for the rally this weekend.

17:16.018 --> 17:18.186
You watch yourself, hillbilly boy.

17:18.688 --> 17:22.608
Come on, boys. My shift's over.
I'll take you over to Cooter's.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.569
Come on.

17:48.092 --> 17:50.511
<i>Jefferson Davis Hogg...</i>

17:50.678 --> 17:53.931
<i>... the meanest man
in Hazzard County.</i>

17:54.140 --> 17:58.770
<i>He's canny as a fox,
tough as a badger...</i>

17:59.145 --> 18:03.399
<i>... and crooked as a hillbilly's smile.</i>

18:05.109 --> 18:07.111
Well, Rosco.

18:09.697 --> 18:13.659
I see you have redecorated.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.871
Interesting style. What do you call it?

18:17.038 --> 18:20.583
- Well, sir, the Dukes...
- The Dukes.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.877
I had a feeling.

18:28.633 --> 18:32.345
I've got some important things
happening here this weekend.

18:32.512 --> 18:36.140
- Yes, sir.
- Are you gonna take care of the Dukes...

18:36.349 --> 18:39.769
...or am I gonna have to make
other plans?

18:39.936 --> 18:42.730
I'm on top of it, Boss.

18:42.897 --> 18:45.441
That's what I'm afraid of.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.071
- You ready?
- Is it bad?

18:50.238 --> 18:51.989
Not good.

18:55.701 --> 18:58.830
Hell, this is worse than the time
you sunk it in the Tipton Swamp.

19:02.166 --> 19:04.335
Mostly cosmetic damage,
right, Cooter?

19:06.045 --> 19:07.547
- Mostly.
- Yeah.

19:07.713 --> 19:12.301
- He's gonna be ready for the race, right?
- Race? Come on, Bo.

19:12.468 --> 19:14.971
I mean, the General doesn't race.

19:15.138 --> 19:17.807
The General erases the competition.

19:36.951 --> 19:38.286
Who does this?

19:40.913 --> 19:45.334
It would make a nice hat or a slipper.

19:45.501 --> 19:49.046
You know what? Just leave the General
here with me. I'll see if I can fix...

19:49.255 --> 19:52.717
I'll have it up running in no time.
Meanwhile, you boys take my truck.

19:54.177 --> 19:55.887
What if you need to tow somebody?

19:56.053 --> 19:59.682
If I can't "toe" them, I'll just finger them.
You know what I mean?

20:04.562 --> 20:10.485
Close one. Even shell-shocked,
he's a better driver than you are.

20:10.651 --> 20:12.653
- Thanks, Cooter.
- Yeah.

20:17.241 --> 20:18.785
Chin up.

20:24.415 --> 20:26.501
Daisy?

20:26.667 --> 20:28.753
<i>Jesse L. Duke.</i>

20:28.961 --> 20:31.756
<i>- Uncle Jesse to you.
- Daisy.</i>

20:31.923 --> 20:34.884
<i>Now, Jesse's been
two places in his life:</i>

20:35.051 --> 20:37.345
<i>Hazzard County and Korea.</i>

20:37.512 --> 20:39.931
- Daisy?
- I'm in here.

20:40.098 --> 20:42.266
<i>- As far as he's concerned...
- Where are you?</i>

20:42.433 --> 20:43.768
I'm in the shower.

20:43.935 --> 20:45.395
<i>- that's one place too many.</i>

20:45.603 --> 20:47.355
Ready or not, here I come.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.616
- How's it looking, good looking?
- Well, I fixed the vapor coils...

20:58.825 --> 21:02.245
...but the boiler's still slow.
You been running this around the clock?

21:02.453 --> 21:06.082
Them boys break more bottles than
they deliver. Eight cases this month.

21:06.332 --> 21:09.252
Wonder where in the hell
they are, anyway.

21:11.212 --> 21:13.256
<i>It'll make you feel lots better.</i>

21:15.842 --> 21:19.095
- Light the son of a bitch.
- All right.

21:24.183 --> 21:26.144
I feel good.

21:26.310 --> 21:29.147
All right, y'all, knock off
the grab-assing over there.

21:29.439 --> 21:31.399
What's going on, Uncle Jesse?

21:31.566 --> 21:34.777
Guy come out of an antique shop
carrying a big grandfather's clock.

21:34.944 --> 21:36.946
Bumped into this drunk,
broke the clock.

21:37.113 --> 21:39.240
Guy said, "Why don't you watch
where you're going."

21:39.407 --> 21:42.785
The drunk says, "Why don't you carry
a wristwatch like everybody else."

21:44.203 --> 21:46.664
Know what happens
when you give a politician Viagra?

21:46.956 --> 21:48.541
- No.
- He gets taller.

21:49.751 --> 21:51.377
Here's another one for you.

21:51.544 --> 21:54.881
How many Dukes does it take
to screw up a moonshine delivery?

21:55.047 --> 21:57.550
Oh, yes, sorry about that,
Uncle Jesse. We...

22:04.348 --> 22:05.641
Is that Rosco?

22:05.933 --> 22:08.686
Wonder what
that fat sack of shit wants.

22:09.437 --> 22:10.897
Come on.

22:12.398 --> 22:16.694
We can skip the "Hi, how are you's."
I'm here on official police business.

22:16.903 --> 22:19.030
Right here, sheriff.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.785
Oh, that's horseshit.
You planted that.

22:28.790 --> 22:32.752
"By the power vested in me
by the County of Hazzard, Georgia...

22:32.919 --> 22:35.004
...I hereby seize this property...

22:35.171 --> 22:38.758
...for the crime of producing
and distributing moonshine."

22:40.176 --> 22:42.970
Now, Jesse,
we can do this the easy way...

22:43.137 --> 22:45.306
...or, of course...

22:47.683 --> 22:49.143
...there's that other way.

22:49.310 --> 22:52.271
- Let's try the that other way first.
- Now, hold on. Wait.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.899
Only way I'm leaving this farm
is in a wooden box.

22:55.108 --> 22:56.984
Well...

22:57.985 --> 23:00.321
Hi, Dukes.

23:02.198 --> 23:03.699
Hi.

23:04.867 --> 23:06.202
Well, now.

23:07.203 --> 23:08.704
Lookie there.

23:09.414 --> 23:14.043
Moonshining.
What a shame, what a shame.

23:14.210 --> 23:17.380
- That ain't ours, Boss.
- Really?

23:17.547 --> 23:19.882
You're out of here.

23:20.049 --> 23:22.301
This land ain't yours anymore.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.512
You're gonna have to
live somewhere else...

23:24.679 --> 23:27.348
...and you're never gonna moonshine...
- Why, you prick!

23:27.515 --> 23:32.645
Watch out. I got my dog here,
and I ain't fed him, and he's real hungry.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.232
Easy, Jesse. Not now.

23:39.652 --> 23:42.780
You boys done started a fight
you can't win.

23:49.620 --> 23:53.416
Well, you have my sympathy.
Y'all take care, now.

23:58.838 --> 24:01.632
- Should've busted a cap in his ass.
- Hell, yeah.

24:01.799 --> 24:03.926
Hey, easy now, boys.

24:04.093 --> 24:07.096
Thanks for taking us in, Pauline.
We really appreciate it.

24:07.305 --> 24:09.098
Oh, honey, it is my pleasure.

24:09.265 --> 24:13.269
I left three toes in Korea for this country,
and this is the thanks I get.

24:13.436 --> 24:15.938
I don't understand how they
could just take your farm.

24:16.147 --> 24:18.024
They planted a still in our barn.

24:18.191 --> 24:22.945
They planted a still? Now,
why would they need to plant a still?

24:23.112 --> 24:26.115
Because they're too damn dumb
to find our real one.

24:26.407 --> 24:30.078
I was waiting on old Bill Miller
up at the truck stop last night.

24:30.244 --> 24:34.540
He said Boss' men seized his land
for some trumped-up charge too.

24:34.957 --> 24:38.920
Maybe it's got to do with all that
construction equipment up at the Millers'.

24:39.087 --> 24:41.547
You wanna go up there
and take a second look?

24:41.714 --> 24:43.633
Oh, I don't know, boys.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.343
Oh, now, Pauline.

24:47.553 --> 24:50.515
Don't worry, Uncle Jesse.
We're gonna take care of it.

24:51.140 --> 24:53.309
You know what's gonna happen,
don't you?

24:53.476 --> 24:56.521
Those two are gonna get themselves
in trouble, end up in jail...

24:56.687 --> 24:59.190
...and I'm gonna have to
shake my ass to get them out.

24:59.399 --> 25:01.526
That's why we love you, honey.

25:05.696 --> 25:09.242
- Oh, goddamn it.
- Well, well, well.

25:10.576 --> 25:12.703
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

25:12.912 --> 25:15.540
What's it look like?
I'm building a doomsday machine...

25:15.706 --> 25:18.042
...gonna aim it right up
your heinie hole.

25:18.334 --> 25:20.545
You stupid enough to think
you can fix this?

25:20.753 --> 25:23.131
- I'm fixing to fix it.
- Oh, you fixing to fix it.

25:23.297 --> 25:26.259
You couldn't fix an election
if your brother was the governor.

25:26.551 --> 25:28.511
What do you want, Rosco?

25:28.719 --> 25:33.850
This here vehicle, it was used in the
illegal transportation of moonshine.

25:34.016 --> 25:35.601
Boss wants it impounded.

25:35.768 --> 25:38.604
It ain't running right now,
and my tow truck ain't here...

25:38.771 --> 25:40.690
...so unless you stick it up your ass...

25:40.857 --> 25:43.401
Hey, one way or another,
grease monkey...

25:43.568 --> 25:46.529
...tomorrow I'm auctioning off
this hunk of junk.

25:46.738 --> 25:49.157
So y'all have a good night, now, okay?

25:52.410 --> 25:56.539
I got two words for you:
soap and water.

25:57.915 --> 26:00.084
That's three words.

26:00.251 --> 26:02.044
Stupid.

26:09.260 --> 26:10.928
Hey, man, this is Cooter.

26:11.137 --> 26:14.640
Round up the fellas.
I got a job for them.

26:18.478 --> 26:20.730
Lot of equipment there
for an abandoned farm.

26:20.897 --> 26:24.317
Yeah, and that fence went up
pretty quick too, huh?

26:24.734 --> 26:27.737
- Let's go ditch the truck.
- All right.

26:52.970 --> 26:55.932
Well, ain't that cute,
a man taking his pig for a walk.

27:00.937 --> 27:02.355
Come on.

27:10.988 --> 27:12.782
What now?

27:19.205 --> 27:21.165
Lookie here, Bo.

27:22.708 --> 27:26.504
He's got our farm marked, right next
to the Millers' and the Robinsons'.

27:27.839 --> 27:31.008
What the hell does he want
with all this land?

27:31.217 --> 27:33.344
I don't know.

27:34.554 --> 27:38.474
But I tell you what,
if I was incriminating information...

27:38.683 --> 27:41.853
...I'd be hiding in that big,
huge son of a bitch.

27:42.228 --> 27:45.356
<i>- How are we supposed to open that?
- I don't know about you...</i>

27:45.565 --> 27:48.317
<i>... but I'd sure hate to be
that safe right now.</i>

27:48.735 --> 27:50.486
Yeah!

28:04.083 --> 28:07.044
Holy shit.

28:17.847 --> 28:19.682
Hope they got e-mail.

28:32.570 --> 28:34.447
Oh, dear.

28:45.083 --> 28:47.043
What the hell?

28:50.963 --> 28:52.381
It's stuck on a pole.

28:52.757 --> 28:55.259
I'll check it.

29:08.147 --> 29:11.275
- Give it some gas!
- Okay!

29:17.365 --> 29:21.577
- Hey, give it a little more gas!
- Okay!

29:21.744 --> 29:24.956
- Hey, Bo, hold up!
- Okay!

29:25.331 --> 29:27.125
Hey! No, Bo! No!

29:27.291 --> 29:29.127
Okay!

29:31.254 --> 29:33.923
- Yeah!
- Bo!

29:35.675 --> 29:38.469
- No, Bo!
- Sorry, cuz.

29:38.636 --> 29:40.471
You'd do the same thing to me.

29:40.638 --> 29:42.473
Bo!

29:48.438 --> 29:50.398
Bo, damn it!

29:51.691 --> 29:53.609
Hold on, little buddy!

29:57.780 --> 29:59.824
Oh, shit!

30:06.956 --> 30:08.416
Bo, you son of a...

30:28.352 --> 30:32.398
I said, no, Bo. No!

30:34.942 --> 30:38.237
I thought you said, "Go, Bo. Go."

30:38.404 --> 30:40.364
You see how that sounds kind of...?

30:44.243 --> 30:47.413
Hey, you know what?
Sheev lives near here.

30:47.580 --> 30:49.665
Maybe he can help us
open this thing up, huh?

30:50.583 --> 30:52.376
Yeah.

30:53.878 --> 30:56.464
Okay. We'll go to Sheev's.

31:05.431 --> 31:08.726
Rosco, this here's Chip.

31:08.893 --> 31:11.145
You might wanna call Hogg...

31:11.312 --> 31:16.067
...and tell him them two fellers,
they made off with his safe.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.404
And I might need a ride too.

31:24.409 --> 31:27.370
Boss, what kind of mood you in?

31:27.578 --> 31:30.748
I'm in a crawfish-boiling mood.

31:31.791 --> 31:36.212
Well, it seems that the Duke boys...

31:36.379 --> 31:38.881
...have stolen your safe.

31:43.886 --> 31:47.181
I am officially upgrading the Dukes...

31:47.348 --> 31:52.145
...from "fly in my ointment"
to "thorn in my side."

31:52.311 --> 31:56.899
And if they happen to elevate
themselves to "pain in my ass"...

31:57.066 --> 32:02.071
...then I'm gonna boil you. Got it?

32:02.280 --> 32:04.615
- Yes, sir.
- Now...

32:04.782 --> 32:08.745
...I want you to find the Dukes
and lock them up.

32:08.953 --> 32:13.374
Oh, and bring me my damn safe back.

32:13.541 --> 32:15.334
Yes, sir.

32:20.173 --> 32:21.466
Flash.

32:33.895 --> 32:35.480
Evening, Sheev.

32:38.066 --> 32:39.692
Sheev.

32:48.493 --> 32:52.288
I'm looking for them Duke boys.
You seen them?

32:54.582 --> 32:57.710
They was last seen
heading up this road here.

32:59.545 --> 33:03.049
You still got them CIA mind probes
stuck in your head, boy?

33:03.216 --> 33:05.843
Far as I know.

33:06.010 --> 33:08.971
Good.
Keep your little antennae up there...

33:09.138 --> 33:12.767
...in case you see the Dukes,
you let me know, you hear?

33:12.934 --> 33:14.519
Yeah.

33:17.522 --> 33:19.816
Stinks out here, you know that?

33:32.078 --> 33:34.080
- Is he gone, Sheev?
- He's gone.

33:43.464 --> 33:45.591
<i>- Prickett, Prickett.
- It means a lot to me...</i>

33:45.758 --> 33:47.885
<i>... to be invited here
back to my hometown.</i>

33:48.094 --> 33:50.221
<i>I hope to remind
the good people of Hazzard...</i>

33:50.430 --> 33:54.183
<i>- ... what it feels like to be proud again.
- We love you, Billy!</i>

33:54.559 --> 33:58.479
<i>And I hope to remind the good people
of Hazzard to come out to the rally...</i>

33:58.646 --> 34:01.149
<i>... and cheer their favorite son,
Billy Prickett!</i>

34:03.568 --> 34:06.154
<i>And I'm declaring today
Billy Prickett Day.</i>

34:07.989 --> 34:10.241
<i>You're too kind.
I just hope, come Saturday...</i>

34:10.449 --> 34:12.994
<i>... I'm not too hazardous on the roads.</i>

34:14.411 --> 34:16.289
"Hazardous on the roads."

34:16.621 --> 34:19.208
<i>- This one's for you!
- This is Tammy Arinder...</i>

34:19.375 --> 34:21.835
<i>... at the parade, for WCNU News.</i>

34:22.003 --> 34:24.172
Seeing Billy Prickett race in person?

34:24.338 --> 34:27.091
That might be worth
putting my pants on for.

34:27.257 --> 34:30.219
- Bo, you racing on Saturday?
- I'm planning on it.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.597
What's the prize for second place?

34:34.389 --> 34:36.141
Gonna be good.
Tough one, good luck.

34:36.309 --> 34:38.936
It's a little weird
he's coming back here to race.

34:39.145 --> 34:43.232
Life's weird, Luke. Someday
you're gonna have to accept that.

34:46.235 --> 34:49.572
Well, okay.
Let's take a look at that lockbox.

34:51.157 --> 34:53.659
Oh, yeah. Liberty 400.

34:54.159 --> 34:57.163
High-density,
9200-psi composite material.

34:57.330 --> 34:59.665
Two-inch chrome bolts,
vertical and horizontal.

34:59.832 --> 35:03.628
And a spring-loaded, independent
relocking device, with a foreign body.

35:03.795 --> 35:07.131
- She's a beauty.
- Can you crack it?

35:07.340 --> 35:09.801
I'm gonna do more than crack it.

35:10.802 --> 35:12.970
Goddamn it.

35:17.517 --> 35:21.646
Armadillo. They've been infiltrating
my perimeter all summer.

35:21.813 --> 35:25.274
- The hell you do with them?
- I make helmets.

35:25.441 --> 35:29.320
Armadillo helmets can block
even the best brain-wave scanners.

35:29.487 --> 35:31.656
Make a pretty good soup bowl too.

35:31.823 --> 35:34.659
So okay. I'm gonna
go to work on this thing.

35:34.826 --> 35:38.663
While I do, would you be a dear, Bo,
and go grab me that armadillo?

35:41.749 --> 35:43.584
Thanks.

35:45.002 --> 35:47.088
Man, he looks pissed off.

35:49.006 --> 35:52.176
Come on, y'all! That was a good one.

35:52.635 --> 35:55.388
All right, maybe you could
take it off now.

35:55.722 --> 35:58.433
Got a real nice deal on this stuff.
Government issue.

35:58.599 --> 36:02.186
Only expired about six months ago,
so should have a real nice pop.

36:03.146 --> 36:05.690
Yeah! Cooter's got
the General running.

36:06.399 --> 36:09.694
- Might be able to race on Saturday.
- Really?

36:09.861 --> 36:13.072
We gotta get it out of there tonight.
Rosco wants to impound it.

36:13.239 --> 36:15.283
Watch your ass, fellas.

36:21.914 --> 36:24.333
This is the fastest-burning
fuse you got, Sheev?

36:24.500 --> 36:26.252
It's a Chinese fuse.

36:39.223 --> 36:41.476
- Might be a wet fuse.
- Well, should we check it?

36:41.642 --> 36:44.479
Depends if you like how your face
is configured, pretty boy.

36:44.645 --> 36:46.355
I think you got the wires backwards.

36:46.522 --> 36:48.900
They're supposed to be.
It's a Chinese fuse.

36:49.108 --> 36:51.277
No, backwards from how
they're supposed to be.

36:51.444 --> 36:54.072
You ever been to China?
Have you ever been to China?

36:54.238 --> 36:55.656
I ate Chinese food once.

36:55.823 --> 36:58.367
Well, you don't blow up
mu shu pork, my friend.

36:58.534 --> 37:00.036
I dated a Korean girl in school.

37:00.244 --> 37:02.789
That is a different Oriental nation.
Get an education.

37:02.955 --> 37:05.416
- You got the fuse wrong.
- You know nothing about...

37:05.583 --> 37:08.211
...Chino-Sino-American relations.
- You're missing the point.

37:19.847 --> 37:21.766
Might've used too much.

37:25.561 --> 37:27.980
Man, that rattled my sphincter.

37:31.984 --> 37:34.946
What the hell is that? Drugs?

37:35.113 --> 37:36.781
Don't look like no drugs I ever saw.

37:37.156 --> 37:41.077
- What the hell are these numbers?
- It's a core sample.

37:41.452 --> 37:45.832
Mining. They drill a hole, take a sample,
send it to the lab, see what they got.

37:45.998 --> 37:48.084
- Core samples of what?
- How should I know?

37:48.251 --> 37:52.088
Am I wearing a white coat here?
I cut bait and blow shit up for a living.

37:52.255 --> 37:56.259
- Take it to a lab.
- I don't know, maybe at the university?

37:56.426 --> 38:00.263
- Katie-Lynn Johnson's at the university.
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

38:00.430 --> 38:03.224
Man, I always had a thing for that girl.

38:03.391 --> 38:06.769
Remember she used to come by
the farm with those tight little outfits?

38:06.936 --> 38:10.606
- No, I can't say I remember that.
- I thought I had her too.

38:10.773 --> 38:14.652
Then she pulled a goddamn Keyser Soze
on me, and like that...

38:14.861 --> 38:16.446
...she was gone.

38:16.612 --> 38:18.781
You don't remember that?

38:18.948 --> 38:20.324
Well, okay.

38:20.491 --> 38:24.162
Unless you need something else blown,
I'll go inside and wash my mongoose.

38:27.373 --> 38:29.167
Okay.

38:30.126 --> 38:32.587
Come on, Luke. Let's get the General.

38:32.879 --> 38:35.131
Why don't we have Cooter stash that.

38:35.298 --> 38:37.341
We'll take his truck,
head to the highway...

38:37.550 --> 38:41.971
How would you feel if the General and I
went to Atlanta and left you behind?

39:09.415 --> 39:11.042
Ain't she a Georgia peach?

39:11.250 --> 39:13.377
What'd you do,
make a deal with the devil?

39:13.753 --> 39:16.589
Luke. Luke. Is that a Hemi?

39:18.841 --> 39:21.803
Me and my buddies lose the Gettysburg
reenactment every other Sunday.

39:21.969 --> 39:24.138
So we figured,
why not let General Lee win one?

39:24.597 --> 39:27.225
I don't know how
we're gonna pay you back, Cooter.

39:27.392 --> 39:31.020
Would a BJ from Daisy be within
the realm of possibility?

39:31.187 --> 39:33.064
Not gonna happen.

39:33.272 --> 39:36.067
How about a pair
of her still-warm shorts?

39:36.275 --> 39:37.610
All right.

39:37.777 --> 39:41.447
Hey, Bo, just win that Hazzard Rally.
That's thanks enough.

39:41.614 --> 39:45.743
And when you get that prize money, you
pay me, because that's how it works.

39:45.952 --> 39:48.162
I love you, Cooter.

39:50.123 --> 39:52.750
- I didn't have time to fix everything.
- Right.

39:55.461 --> 39:57.422
Let's get that car.

40:24.323 --> 40:27.452
Get in your cars and get them!
Get after them! Now!

40:27.660 --> 40:29.746
Cooter!

40:35.376 --> 40:37.253
All right.

40:38.796 --> 40:41.466
That's so good, man.

40:44.135 --> 40:46.012
Enough.

40:46.179 --> 40:50.141
Man, I'm never gonna get out
of this car again. I'm gonna live in it.

40:50.349 --> 40:53.144
I'm gonna eat in it.
And I'm gonna make sweet love to it.

40:53.603 --> 40:55.563
You mean you gonna make
sweet love in it.

40:55.730 --> 40:57.315
Oh, no, I wanna fuck it.

40:57.523 --> 41:00.234
<i>All units, we are in hot pursuit
of them Duke boys...</i>

41:00.401 --> 41:03.863
...in their piece-of-shit orange car.

41:06.574 --> 41:08.326
"Piece of..." You son of a bitch.

41:27.387 --> 41:29.013
Hey! Get back here!

41:29.222 --> 41:32.100
- "Lost Sheep, you out there"?
- Hey, Cooter.

41:32.266 --> 41:35.728
<i>These fellas ain't gonna be
doing much chasing.</i>

41:35.895 --> 41:38.940
- Thanks, man.
- I'm gonna run right over Billy Prickett.

41:39.107 --> 41:40.817
How about we go to Atlanta first?

41:40.983 --> 41:43.486
All right, cuz.

41:45.822 --> 41:49.826
Oh, look at that.
There's your problem right there.

41:50.034 --> 41:51.369
Yeah, that's a shame.

41:53.538 --> 41:55.998
Let's go to Atlanta.

42:05.842 --> 42:07.802
Luke.

42:07.969 --> 42:09.721
Luke.

42:11.139 --> 42:16.060
I know why it didn't work out with
me and Katie before. It was just timing.

42:16.269 --> 42:18.896
Life is all about timing, you know?

42:19.188 --> 42:22.692
It's my time now.
I'm gonna win that race on Saturday.

42:22.900 --> 42:26.612
We're gonna get the farm back.
I got my BFF, you.

42:27.613 --> 42:30.408
And I'm gonna get Katie Johnson,
you watch.

42:34.787 --> 42:36.914
It's my time.

42:38.291 --> 42:41.669
What's going on?

42:44.464 --> 42:49.177
Yeah, baby!
Southern by the grace of God!

42:52.638 --> 42:55.183
Well, at least we know
they're nice up here.

42:55.433 --> 42:58.978
Hurry up, you're late
for your Klan meeting, asshole.

42:59.145 --> 43:01.731
- Klan meeting?
- Don't listen to her.

43:01.898 --> 43:05.276
The South will rise again.

43:05.485 --> 43:07.737
Yee-haw, brother!

43:07.904 --> 43:09.947
What the hell's wrong
with these people?

43:10.156 --> 43:13.326
Nice roof, redneck.
Join us in the 21 st century?

43:21.793 --> 43:24.545
We're gonna make
some friends up here, huh?

43:33.763 --> 43:36.391
Oh, excuse me.
Can I help you, ma'am?

43:36.557 --> 43:38.393
Daisy! Oh, boy.

43:38.559 --> 43:40.978
Enos, what's Boss doing
taking all that land?

43:41.145 --> 43:45.316
I don't know. They won't tell me. You
gotta go. I'm supposed to arrest you.

43:45.525 --> 43:48.194
- Come on, I'm serious.
- Get. Get out of here.

43:48.361 --> 43:51.531
Hey. You Anus?

43:52.115 --> 43:54.075
No, that's Enos, Mr. Prickett.

43:55.827 --> 43:59.163
Sorry about that. Is Hogg around?
He asked me to come by.

43:59.330 --> 44:03.793
Oh, yeah. He's out back
in the garage, Mr. Prickett.

44:05.211 --> 44:07.463
Well, howdy, ma'am.
How are you today?

44:07.630 --> 44:10.007
It's just right on out back there.
I'll show you.

44:10.174 --> 44:13.094
Yep, head out that way.

44:16.097 --> 44:18.266
There you go.

44:20.351 --> 44:22.228
There he is.

44:22.395 --> 44:24.397
- Hometown hero.
- Hogg.

44:24.564 --> 44:26.232
- How you doing, son?
- Well...

44:26.399 --> 44:29.694
...this is a great place to crap,
but I'm ready to head to Atlanta.

44:29.861 --> 44:31.237
Not before the race.

44:31.571 --> 44:33.740
Don't you worry about that.

44:33.906 --> 44:37.326
I want you down at that finish line.
Sign autographs for the kids.

44:37.493 --> 44:39.412
- Yeah, I know the drill.
- I know you do.

44:39.579 --> 44:42.582
But I need you there for two hours, son.
Two hours.

44:42.749 --> 44:44.876
Kissing hands and shaking babies.

44:45.084 --> 44:48.713
You got that backwards.
It's shaking hands and kiss the babies.

44:48.921 --> 44:52.842
Oh, yeah? Maybe that's why I lost
that governor's election in '86.

44:57.597 --> 44:59.682
Hogg, what the hell am I doing here?

44:59.849 --> 45:01.809
Rosco.

45:04.896 --> 45:07.648
Whoa, what is this?
You off the reservation?

45:07.815 --> 45:10.568
See how it kind of catches me
around the eyes there?

45:10.777 --> 45:14.072
Look here, I already got sponsors.

45:14.238 --> 45:17.033
What am I supposed
to tell Castrol, Yahoo!?

45:17.200 --> 45:19.619
Tell them it's for charity.

45:19.786 --> 45:22.080
- Is it?
- Sure. Could be.

45:23.372 --> 45:27.001
Whatever you say.
I'm gonna win that race by a mile.

45:27.168 --> 45:29.754
It don't matter whose face
is on my car when I do.

45:29.921 --> 45:35.134
I don't need you to win the race.
I just need you to show up.

45:48.272 --> 45:50.691
Hey there, Mr. Prickett.

45:50.858 --> 45:53.277
Well, hello, Daisy.

45:53.486 --> 45:58.616
I was just walking by, and I saw your car
in the garage there. She's real sexy.

45:58.783 --> 46:02.120
Well, thank you.
She's faster than a cheetah on cocaine.

46:02.286 --> 46:04.038
Yeah, I know.

46:04.205 --> 46:06.958
Why is there a picture of Boss Hogg
on your car, though?

46:07.125 --> 46:09.252
- Yeah, well, he...
- I read somewhere...

46:09.419 --> 46:15.133
...that Coca-Cola pays you over
$ 100,000 to put their logo on your door.

46:15.299 --> 46:17.009
- You read that?
- That same article...

46:17.176 --> 46:20.012
...mentioned that Budweiser
pays you over $ 100,000...

46:20.179 --> 46:22.807
...to put their logo on your trunk.
- Look, Daisy...

46:23.015 --> 46:25.893
...l'm not much of a reader.
- Boss Hogg's face is sitting...

46:26.060 --> 46:29.731
...on over $200,000 worth
of real estate.

46:30.022 --> 46:31.441
Is that what he's paying you?

46:31.607 --> 46:36.237
Oh, no, no, Daisy,
this race here is for charity.

46:36.404 --> 46:38.406
Really? Which one?

46:40.241 --> 46:41.784
Anal bifida.

46:41.951 --> 46:43.619
Spinal bifida.

46:43.953 --> 46:45.496
It's one of the bifidas.

46:47.623 --> 46:51.461
Have I told you that you're as purty
as a Hazzard County sunset?

46:51.627 --> 46:54.839
Have a good day, Mr. Prickett.

46:55.048 --> 46:57.383
Okay.

47:15.068 --> 47:17.570
Lot of smart people out there.

47:40.760 --> 47:42.887
Look out, Katie.

47:46.265 --> 47:48.476
Hello. Hi.

47:48.810 --> 47:50.311
- Hello.
- Hello.

47:50.478 --> 47:53.606
- Oh, boy.
- Hi.

47:54.607 --> 47:58.653
You don't think it's too late
to take them SATs, do you?

48:02.782 --> 48:05.410
You gotta keep an open mind
in college.

48:07.161 --> 48:10.415
This is it, Luke. I can feel it.

48:10.623 --> 48:13.167
Hey, do you know
where Katie Johnson is?

48:13.334 --> 48:15.211
I think she's in that room right there.

48:15.378 --> 48:17.380
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

48:20.174 --> 48:22.677
- I got a great opening line for Katie.
- What is it?

48:22.844 --> 48:24.595
You'll see.

48:24.804 --> 48:27.640
- Katie Johnson?
- She's down the hall.

48:27.807 --> 48:31.352
- Cool.
- Come on, down the hall.

48:34.105 --> 48:36.232
Katie Johnson?

48:36.399 --> 48:39.652
- She's down the hall.
- Do you guys go to school here?

48:40.653 --> 48:42.864
No, but do you have an application?

48:43.406 --> 48:44.782
Not on me.

48:46.659 --> 48:48.995
Come on, now, focus.

48:54.333 --> 48:56.252
Let's hope she's not in here either.

48:56.419 --> 48:59.213
- Katie Johnson?
- Fuck me running!

48:59.714 --> 49:02.633
- You looking for Katie?
- We were.

49:03.009 --> 49:05.803
- You guys Hacky?
- Hacky!

49:06.012 --> 49:09.140
- What about Katie?
- Maybe she's in here.

49:16.189 --> 49:18.691
Goodbye, Bo. Bye, Luke.

49:19.067 --> 49:20.902
I guess she wasn't in there.

49:21.069 --> 49:23.654
- We didn't check under the couch.
- Luke! Bo!

49:23.821 --> 49:25.948
- Katie.
- Katie-Lynn.

49:30.369 --> 49:32.497
So he's still doing that?

49:34.040 --> 49:36.918
- Did I just faint?
- No.

49:37.085 --> 49:39.337
Oh, my God. I can't believe y'all came.

49:40.380 --> 49:43.341
We just wanna pay you visit,
the prettiest girl in Atlanta.

49:43.674 --> 49:45.510
What?

49:45.676 --> 49:49.180
We just wanna pay a visit
to the prettiest girl in Atlanta.

49:49.347 --> 49:52.433
That's sweet. I can't believe
what happened to y'all's farm.

49:52.600 --> 49:54.185
We're gonna get it back.

49:54.352 --> 49:57.188
I love that farm.
I used to have so much fun there.

49:57.814 --> 49:59.524
- See?
- This is my roommate, Annette.

49:59.690 --> 50:02.193
- Annette, this is Bo and Luke.
- Nice to meet you.

50:02.360 --> 50:05.613
- Ma'am.
- Annette's from Australia.

50:05.905 --> 50:09.158
Let's put another shrimp
on the barbie!

50:12.370 --> 50:14.705
- That's what they say there.
- Okay.

50:14.872 --> 50:16.874
What do y'all need
in the geology lab?

50:17.041 --> 50:19.710
It has something to do
with them taking our farm...

50:19.877 --> 50:22.547
...but we don't know
what the hell it is.

50:24.048 --> 50:26.884
I don't know that they'll let y'all in,
but we'll take you.

50:27.051 --> 50:30.346
- We'll get dressed. Y'all wait downstairs.
- We're gonna wait here.

50:30.513 --> 50:32.724
Downstairs is fine.

50:36.310 --> 50:39.313
It's happening, Luke.
It's all happening.

50:48.072 --> 50:49.866
I'll give you that, Jesse.

50:50.032 --> 50:53.035
- I'll give you that.
- Will you now?

50:54.162 --> 50:56.998
What are you doing with my land,
Jefferson?

50:57.749 --> 50:59.834
Ain't your land anymore.

51:00.376 --> 51:03.755
Wasn't that long ago you was
a moonshiner too. Remember?

51:03.921 --> 51:05.798
Well, I have reformed from my sins.

51:05.965 --> 51:08.509
I am now an honest businessman.

51:08.676 --> 51:10.428
Like sponsoring racecars?

51:10.595 --> 51:13.806
What are you getting out of bringing
Billy Prickett down here?

51:15.475 --> 51:19.479
You know, your nephew's won that race
four years in a row.

51:19.645 --> 51:23.316
Now, who's gonna fault me
for breaking up a dynasty?

51:23.483 --> 51:25.568
Well, I know you're rich,
and I know you stink.

51:25.777 --> 51:27.612
But you ain't stinking rich.

51:27.779 --> 51:30.031
You wouldn't be throwing
that money at Prickett...

51:30.198 --> 51:32.867
...unless you thought he was
gonna earn you 10 times that.

51:33.034 --> 51:37.830
You're a smart man.
So why don't you do the smart thing.

51:37.997 --> 51:41.042
Why don't you take your family
and leave.

51:41.209 --> 51:44.796
Because, see, now I own that farm.

51:44.962 --> 51:48.424
And you ain't never gonna get it back.

52:00.144 --> 52:03.064
I have all the cards, Jesse.

52:03.231 --> 52:04.941
You don't have spit.

52:05.400 --> 52:07.485
It ain't over yet.

52:12.281 --> 52:15.368
Hey, Bo, I love your car.
She really rumbles.

52:15.660 --> 52:18.371
It's actually a he. Right, Katie?

52:25.294 --> 52:26.879
I ain't even speeding.

52:44.856 --> 52:47.150
You know how fast you were going?

52:47.316 --> 52:52.113
- What?
- How fast you were going.

52:53.030 --> 52:55.867
- I don't know. Ten?
- Eight.

52:56.033 --> 53:01.038
- Isn't the speed limit 10?
- Yeah. It is.

53:01.539 --> 53:04.000
You guys police?

53:04.208 --> 53:05.835
Campus police.

53:12.467 --> 53:14.510
Mother of God.

53:23.478 --> 53:25.021
Oh, wait.

53:35.490 --> 53:39.535
I know it's a shame to hide your beauty
like this, but it's for your own good.

53:39.702 --> 53:41.079
What?

53:41.662 --> 53:43.956
I'm not even gonna respond to that.
That's crazy.

53:44.248 --> 53:48.086
I know, I'll miss you too.
I'll be right back.

53:48.669 --> 53:51.506
All right, let's go. Let's go.

53:57.053 --> 54:01.391
Katie-Lynn seems like a girl you could
settle down with, don't you think, Luke?

54:01.557 --> 54:03.309
- Yeah.
- I don't know, fellas.

54:03.476 --> 54:05.770
I don't think they're gonna
let us walk in.

54:05.937 --> 54:10.608
You'll think of something, Katie.
You always do. Remember that...?

54:10.775 --> 54:13.403
Oh, you're so pretty.

54:25.123 --> 54:27.667
I have an idea.

54:34.632 --> 54:38.052
- Can I help you?
- You're just the guy we're looking for...

54:38.219 --> 54:39.971
- Royce.
- Royce...?

54:40.138 --> 54:43.850
- Royce Williams.
- Royce Williams, maybe you can help us.

54:44.016 --> 54:49.147
We're here looking for the brightest
young geologists for high-paying jobs.

54:49.313 --> 54:50.815
Maybe you've been by our booth.

54:50.982 --> 54:54.318
- You're from Kamasaka Technologies?
- That's right.

54:54.485 --> 54:58.322
I'm Mr. Ichinowa,
and this is my colleague...

54:58.489 --> 54:59.991
...Yoko Takanoshi.

55:01.617 --> 55:02.952
Right on.

55:03.745 --> 55:05.538
You said you were Japanese?

55:06.122 --> 55:07.331
We converted.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.462
Your professor tells us you're some
kind of super-genius or something.

55:12.670 --> 55:16.841
- Really? On my last test I got a C-minus.
- Hey, that's good.

55:17.008 --> 55:20.094
- That's real good.
- You think...?

55:20.261 --> 55:22.555
You just might be
Kamasaka Tech material.

55:23.181 --> 55:25.516
You just gotta pass this one little test.

55:25.683 --> 55:29.479
You just tell us what this is right here.

55:29.687 --> 55:31.981
Looks like a core sample.

55:32.148 --> 55:35.276
- Man, that's good.
- He's good.

55:35.443 --> 55:39.030
- Core sample of what?
- Oh, of course.

55:55.671 --> 55:58.466
- What are you doing?
- What?

55:58.633 --> 56:02.804
- What the fuck was that?
- Relax.

56:12.230 --> 56:14.023
Damn! Damn!

56:14.482 --> 56:16.192
These are my good Levi's.

56:16.359 --> 56:18.444
Let's not lose focus here, Royce.

56:18.611 --> 56:20.196
Yes, sir, Mr. Takanoshi.

56:20.363 --> 56:22.990
- What'd you call me?
- Mr. Takanoshi?

56:23.574 --> 56:26.702
Right. That's my name.

56:28.037 --> 56:31.916
- Thought it might be drugs or something.
- I think I know what it is.

56:44.554 --> 56:47.014
Are you really with
Kamasaka Technologies?

56:47.181 --> 56:49.934
Damn it, we are high-powered
Japanese executives.

56:50.101 --> 56:52.729
We work hard,
and we play even harder.

56:52.937 --> 56:54.605
Now, tell us what you see there...

56:54.772 --> 56:57.817
...or we'll go find another candidate
at Georgia Polytech.

56:57.984 --> 57:00.862
It's anthracite.

57:01.404 --> 57:04.699
- Coal.
- Coal in Hazzard?

57:04.866 --> 57:08.077
- What's the street value of this?
- This much? Nothing.

57:08.244 --> 57:10.663
A good-sized mine? Could be millions.

57:11.080 --> 57:13.583
Can you show us what
a good-sized mine looks like?

57:13.750 --> 57:15.835
Yeah.

57:18.755 --> 57:22.258
Here's what it used to look like.
And this is the after.

57:26.971 --> 57:29.098
Damn.

57:29.474 --> 57:33.394
- Hogg's gonna do this to Hazzard?
- The hell he is.

57:33.644 --> 57:36.522
Mr. Kamasaka? We have to go.
The plane is leaving.

57:36.689 --> 57:40.693
Congratulations, Royce. You got the job.
How does 24,000 yen a year sound?

57:41.027 --> 57:42.904
Sounds like 40 bucks.

57:43.071 --> 57:44.405
Way to go.

57:44.572 --> 57:47.992
All right, man. See you in Beijing.

57:51.954 --> 57:55.833
- You see two guys come through here?
- You mean those two Japanese guys?

58:15.019 --> 58:17.605
Get me Atlanta P.D. Damn.

58:17.772 --> 58:19.023
<i>Strip-mining?</i>

58:19.273 --> 58:20.691
Why, that slimy bastard.

58:21.109 --> 58:22.610
<i>Here's another little nugget.</i>

58:22.777 --> 58:25.863
Hogg has been paying
that kid Prickett a lot of money...

58:26.030 --> 58:28.366
...to race here Saturday.
- He's paying him?

58:28.908 --> 58:32.161
Y'all better get your asses back here
quick as you can, got it?

58:32.328 --> 58:34.705
Ten-four, Shepherd,
this is Lost Sheep out.

58:36.499 --> 58:39.210
What's this? What's these crackers
doing in our place?

58:39.377 --> 58:43.005
Turns out Prickett came back because
Hogg paid him a assload of cash.

58:43.297 --> 58:46.217
Don't mean Billy has anything
to do with strip-mining.

58:46.384 --> 58:48.052
You got to be kidding me.

58:48.761 --> 58:50.680
Oh, shit. Roll them up.

58:51.514 --> 58:54.392
- What the hell is this, man?
- Looks like somebody's lost.

58:54.559 --> 58:58.020
Look, a couple of white boys playing
black. Is that's what's going on?

58:58.187 --> 59:01.691
Actually, we were at the geology lab
for some environmental stuff, and...

59:01.899 --> 59:06.863
No, I get it. They on one of these
reality shows.

59:07.071 --> 59:09.949
<i>- Who Wanna Get They Ass Kicked?
- Yeah.</i>

59:10.700 --> 59:14.704
Why don't you two hillbillies
join us up here for a minute?

59:14.871 --> 59:16.873
Actually, we prefer
Appalachian-Americans.

59:17.081 --> 59:18.708
Man, get out the car!

59:20.877 --> 59:24.589
Now, which one of you two
brothers is Michelangelo?

59:26.090 --> 59:30.678
<i>There's a certain creek that people
sometimes canoe up without a paddle.</i>

59:30.845 --> 59:35.516
<i>You could say that the Duke boys
were on that particular creek right now.</i>

59:35.683 --> 59:38.019
Let's kick they ass, Jerry!

59:39.687 --> 59:42.482
Never thought I'd say this,
but, hot damn, it's the cops.

59:44.442 --> 59:45.860
<i>There goes the canoe.</i>

59:50.948 --> 59:53.034
- Give me your shoelaces.
- What?

59:53.201 --> 59:57.622
These guys over there gave me theirs.
See, I'm gonna fashion myself a lasso.

59:57.789 --> 01:00:01.417
When the jailer comes in,
I'm gonna rope his keys.

01:00:01.584 --> 01:00:05.630
Luke and Bo Duke are home free.
Period, end of story.

01:00:05.797 --> 01:00:08.925
I got on cowboy boots, cuz.

01:00:09.092 --> 01:00:11.886
I like your style.

01:00:12.053 --> 01:00:13.971
You gonna need those shoelaces?

01:00:14.138 --> 01:00:17.100
We gonna have to get out of here.

01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:21.687
Hey, Yul Brynner. We gotta make
a phone call. We gotta call our lawyer.

01:00:21.854 --> 01:00:23.481
What the hell are we in here for?

01:00:23.815 --> 01:00:28.277
Well, where should I start?

01:00:34.325 --> 01:00:36.327
We know you're gonna
strip-mine Hazzard.

01:00:36.494 --> 01:00:39.914
Do you, now? Well, that's good.

01:00:40.081 --> 01:00:42.417
Guess where I'm gonna sink
that first drill.

01:00:42.583 --> 01:00:45.253
Right down in the middle
of your bedroom.

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:49.257
Y'all do still share a bunk bed, right?

01:00:49.424 --> 01:00:52.635
Hey, that's a phat suit there.
What, you some type of pimp?

01:00:55.221 --> 01:01:00.059
What has strip-mining got to do with you
paying Billy Prickett to race tomorrow?

01:01:00.435 --> 01:01:03.229
You like magic, Luke? Sleight of hand?

01:01:03.396 --> 01:01:09.569
See, while you're looking over here,
something's really happening over here.

01:01:09.736 --> 01:01:15.158
You see, despite the fact
that I now own your beloved farm...

01:01:15.324 --> 01:01:20.079
...I can't legally mine it,
because the county won't let me.

01:01:20.246 --> 01:01:22.665
I need to hold a public hearing,
you know...

01:01:22.832 --> 01:01:28.379
...to give the citizens of Hazzard
a chance to object.

01:01:29.047 --> 01:01:32.967
And let me guess, you're going to hold
the hearing during the rally tomorrow?

01:01:33.134 --> 01:01:37.430
And if nobody knows about the hearing,
there won't be anyone there to object.

01:01:38.473 --> 01:01:40.516
- There you go.
- Sleight of hand.

01:01:40.683 --> 01:01:43.019
- Sleight of hand.
- Grow the fingernails out.

01:01:43.186 --> 01:01:46.189
Then pop some fingernail polish
on them bitches.

01:01:47.523 --> 01:01:49.734
- Is Billy Prickett in on it?
- Prickett?

01:01:51.778 --> 01:01:56.491
- Prickett's just collecting a paycheck.
- We ain't gonna let you get away with it.

01:01:56.657 --> 01:02:01.496
Really? Tomorrow, if you happen to be
strolling by the courthouse about noon...

01:02:01.662 --> 01:02:04.916
...you might wanna rush right in there
and voice your objections.

01:02:05.083 --> 01:02:06.667
Voice this.

01:02:08.753 --> 01:02:11.547
Dadgum it. I just remembered.

01:02:11.714 --> 01:02:15.093
Tomorrow morning
you're going to the Georgia work farm.

01:02:15.259 --> 01:02:19.389
And I hear they have a rather
strict policy on weekend passes.

01:02:19.597 --> 01:02:22.558
Yo, B. You need to pop
a feather in that hat, yo.

01:02:22.725 --> 01:02:25.395
Then your man ho's will be having
more respect for you.

01:02:25.728 --> 01:02:27.438
I have $ 100 right here...

01:02:27.605 --> 01:02:30.400
...for whoever knocks
that loudmouth son of a bitch out.

01:02:32.318 --> 01:02:33.736
Thank you.

01:02:33.903 --> 01:02:36.447
Now, break some rocks for me, boys.

01:02:36.614 --> 01:02:39.283
Take care, now, you hear?

01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:41.577
Bye-bye.

01:02:42.745 --> 01:02:46.332
Don't you know you're not supposed
to wear white after Labor Day?

01:03:05.226 --> 01:03:07.103
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:11.649
When we stop for gas, we call up Cooter
and tell him to put a pig in the road, right.

01:03:11.816 --> 01:03:16.028
Then when the cops are moving the pig,
Cooter hooks up a cable to the bumper.

01:03:16.195 --> 01:03:19.574
Car drives away,
the hook will pull out the whole chassis.

01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:22.160
He can't drive without a chassis...

01:03:22.326 --> 01:03:23.995
All right, shut up back there!

01:03:24.162 --> 01:03:27.206
My cousin's starting to go crazy.
We gotta get him to a hospital.

01:03:27.373 --> 01:03:29.667
I think he done caught the fever,
or something.

01:03:29.834 --> 01:03:33.421
That's what happens
when you're humping livestock, hillbilly.

01:03:33.588 --> 01:03:36.007
Can we help you guys out
with anything up there...

01:03:36.174 --> 01:03:38.342
...oblige you with a reach-around
or something?

01:03:38.509 --> 01:03:40.887
Of course, you'd have to un-cuff us first.

01:03:41.054 --> 01:03:44.390
Sarge, if you and me was to have
a chase, you think you could catch me?

01:03:44.891 --> 01:03:48.019
- Appears to me you caught already, son.
- I'm serious.

01:03:48.186 --> 01:03:52.106
If I had my car and you was in this one,
you really think you could catch me?

01:03:52.273 --> 01:03:54.984
Because, bubba,
this car feels kind of slow to me.

01:03:55.151 --> 01:03:58.112
She's got plenty under the hood,
don't you worry about that.

01:03:58.279 --> 01:03:59.906
- No balls.
- No balls.

01:04:00.073 --> 01:04:02.241
No balls. No balls.

01:04:02.408 --> 01:04:03.826
- No balls.
- No balls.

01:04:03.993 --> 01:04:05.995
You wanna see balls?

01:04:06.162 --> 01:04:08.998
- No balls. No balls.
- Will you slow this car down?

01:04:09.165 --> 01:04:12.502
You letting them get your panties
in a bunch. You the officer.

01:04:12.668 --> 01:04:15.046
Shut the hell up back there. All right?

01:04:15.338 --> 01:04:18.716
- No balls.
- Oh, my God. Will you look at that?

01:04:18.925 --> 01:04:22.011
You need a napkin
to eat them drumsticks, boy.

01:04:23.638 --> 01:04:26.391
- Goddamn it.
- Nice driving!

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:34.273
What seems to be the problem, sugar?

01:04:34.774 --> 01:04:37.568
I think something bounced up
into my undercarriage.

01:04:37.735 --> 01:04:40.071
- Will you take a look?
- Ma'am, I'd be pleased...

01:04:40.238 --> 01:04:42.573
...to check your undercarriage.
- Thank you.

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.326
I stopped you
because your taillight is out.

01:04:45.493 --> 01:04:47.286
Stopped me? Sir, you hit me.

01:04:47.453 --> 01:04:50.415
Because your taillight is out,
and we couldn't see you brake.

01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:52.959
- You're gonna write me a ticket?
- Yep.

01:04:53.292 --> 01:04:55.169
This is ridiculous!

01:04:57.588 --> 01:05:00.466
Is there anything I can help you out
with today, ma'am?

01:05:00.633 --> 01:05:03.511
Do cute cops grow on trees
around here or what?

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.765
Well, I, you know... Pushups.
Kind of you to notice.

01:05:07.932 --> 01:05:10.977
Let me see what's going on
under your hood here.

01:05:12.729 --> 01:05:16.482
- Damn, that's hot.
- Here. Maybe this'll help.

01:05:20.403 --> 01:05:23.781
- Bless you.
- No, no, no. My undercarriage.

01:05:23.948 --> 01:05:26.367
- Your undercarriage?
- Yeah.

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:37.170
Looks like you boys
have the magic touch.

01:05:47.055 --> 01:05:49.390
I was about to seal the deal
when you came over.

01:05:49.557 --> 01:05:51.768
What? She was looking at me
the whole time.

01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:56.105
- Let's get out of here.
- Where are the goddamn keys?

01:06:01.527 --> 01:06:04.030
Y'all think you can catch me now?

01:06:18.586 --> 01:06:20.463
Buckle up, this might get exciting.

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:24.050
That's all right. We'll be long gone
before another cop shows up.

01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:26.677
Get skinny!

01:06:37.897 --> 01:06:40.483
- Okay, where's the highway?
- Don't you have a map?

01:06:41.567 --> 01:06:43.027
Wait. I got it.

01:06:46.531 --> 01:06:47.865
Turn left up here!

01:06:48.032 --> 01:06:49.367
Turn left, turn left!

01:06:50.868 --> 01:06:52.870
Damn it, I said, left!

01:06:53.037 --> 01:06:55.415
- You said your left!
- My left is your left.

01:06:55.581 --> 01:06:58.292
I'm gonna need
these directions faster.

01:07:01.045 --> 01:07:04.006
It's okay.
I know exactly where we're at.

01:07:11.556 --> 01:07:13.266
So, girls, how's the back seat?

01:07:13.433 --> 01:07:17.395
I haven't had this much fun since
we used to sneak up to the hayloft.

01:07:19.021 --> 01:07:22.150
You remember those tight little outfits
you used to make me wear.

01:07:27.447 --> 01:07:31.033
- I didn't know how to break it to you.
- You didn't know?

01:07:31.242 --> 01:07:33.077
Luke, you said he was okay with it.

01:07:36.748 --> 01:07:39.125
Look at the road, Bo.

01:07:39.292 --> 01:07:41.335
Bo, look at the road.

01:07:42.503 --> 01:07:45.757
- Look at the road.
- Supposed to be my time.

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:48.384
Bo!

01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:10.907
I think I'm gonna chunder.

01:08:11.074 --> 01:08:12.950
- Is that bad?
- That means "vomit."

01:08:13.117 --> 01:08:14.660
- Not in the car.
- Bo!

01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:44.439
You told me she wasn't
emotionally available for me.

01:08:44.607 --> 01:08:47.693
That it was better to lose a lover
than to love a loser!

01:08:47.859 --> 01:08:50.238
Because you would faint
every time you saw her!

01:08:50.404 --> 01:08:52.948
I don't faint.

01:08:55.033 --> 01:08:56.493
You called me a loser?

01:08:56.661 --> 01:08:58.621
I was trying to make him feel better.

01:08:58.787 --> 01:09:00.331
Can you just let me out here?

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.515
Bo, this is some of the best driving
I ever seen you do.

01:09:17.682 --> 01:09:20.643
- Ain't that right, girls?
- Great driving, Bo. Great driving.

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:22.478
Don't kiss my ass.

01:09:27.817 --> 01:09:30.819
- Bo, you gotta get us out of here.
- I can't hear you.

01:09:31.028 --> 01:09:33.990
- You're being ridiculous, Bo.
- Life is ridiculous, Katie.

01:09:34.198 --> 01:09:36.242
I really need a plastic bag now.

01:09:42.122 --> 01:09:44.042
What is the purpose of this circle?

01:09:47.754 --> 01:09:49.087
How do we get out of here?

01:09:49.255 --> 01:09:51.466
- Take this right.
- I'm not listening to you.

01:09:51.631 --> 01:09:53.551
Take a right here.

01:09:55.178 --> 01:09:56.512
Hell.

01:10:06.397 --> 01:10:08.608
You're scaring the girls.
Get back on the road.

01:10:08.775 --> 01:10:11.652
- Say sorry for stealing Katie.
- You were never together!

01:10:11.819 --> 01:10:13.488
I liked her. You betrayed that.

01:10:13.654 --> 01:10:16.324
- I liked her too!
- I liked her first.

01:10:17.366 --> 01:10:18.576
Calm down, Bo!

01:10:18.743 --> 01:10:20.787
I will calm down
when he says he's sorry!

01:10:20.953 --> 01:10:23.039
- Say you're sorry.
- I ain't saying it.

01:10:23.206 --> 01:10:25.500
Have you made your peace
with God yet, Luke?

01:10:25.666 --> 01:10:29.087
Because you're about to
meet your maker!

01:10:29.379 --> 01:10:30.838
- Just say you're sorry!
- No.

01:10:31.005 --> 01:10:34.675
We had a good time,
and I'm not gonna apologize for that.

01:10:50.733 --> 01:10:53.111
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:10:53.277 --> 01:10:55.780
Fine. I'll take Annette.

01:10:58.825 --> 01:11:01.202
That was fun.

01:11:09.293 --> 01:11:11.754
<i>Lost Sheep, Lost Sheep,
are you out there?</i>

01:11:11.921 --> 01:11:13.297
Uncle Jesse, where are you?

01:11:13.464 --> 01:11:17.260
There's a hearing at the courthouse.
We gotta get everybody over there now.

01:11:17.427 --> 01:11:19.804
<i>Sounds like a mighty fine plan, Lucas.</i>

01:11:19.971 --> 01:11:22.515
Only got one wrinkle to it.

01:11:22.682 --> 01:11:29.105
You do that, could be very bad
for Jesse and Pauline's health.

01:11:29.397 --> 01:11:31.149
Hogg, you lay one hand on them...

01:11:31.315 --> 01:11:34.360
...and I'll shove a apple in your mouth
and my foot up your ass.

01:11:34.527 --> 01:11:36.195
<i>Well, you bring the Vaseline.</i>

01:11:36.863 --> 01:11:38.489
We'll make it a party.

01:11:38.656 --> 01:11:42.285
<i>You two boys stay out of Hazzard,
and I mean it this time.</i>

01:11:42.452 --> 01:11:45.163
- Where you think they got them?
- I don't know.

01:11:45.329 --> 01:11:48.666
- Hogg's never gone this far before.
- You ready to go that far?

01:11:49.333 --> 01:11:52.920
Cousin, I'm always ready
to go that far.

01:12:06.184 --> 01:12:09.437
What are we doing here?
This is Derek Sheevington's place.

01:12:09.604 --> 01:12:13.858
Yeah. Pretty good chance this is gonna
get ugly, so we're gonna drop you here.

01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:17.070
He got caught drinking
out of the toilet in the girls' bathroom.

01:12:17.236 --> 01:12:20.865
I know, I know. But we're gonna need
you girls to work with him.

01:12:21.949 --> 01:12:23.242
Oh, good God.

01:12:26.037 --> 01:12:28.706
Why, Katie Johnson, is that you?

01:12:28.873 --> 01:12:30.708
Boy, you filled out real nice.

01:12:30.875 --> 01:12:33.711
Yeah. You filled out
real nice too, Sheev.

01:12:33.878 --> 01:12:37.840
What's going on, Sheev? Looks like
we're gonna need some of those toys.

01:12:38.049 --> 01:12:41.886
Leave them two girls here,
I'll give you anything you want.

01:12:42.053 --> 01:12:44.555
Come on in. I'll put a stew on.

01:12:54.190 --> 01:12:58.069
- Hazzard County Police Department.
- Enos, this is Boss Hogg.

01:12:58.236 --> 01:13:00.279
<i>Me and Rosco are over
at the Duke place.</i>

01:13:00.446 --> 01:13:04.242
<i>- lf anybody wants us, we'll be here.
- Well, that's mighty consid...</i>

01:13:06.744 --> 01:13:11.290
Rosco, I'm going over
and join the governor at the rally.

01:13:11.457 --> 01:13:15.253
Do not be late
going to the courthouse.

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:18.715
Boss, how come you told old Enos there
where we was at?

01:13:22.093 --> 01:13:24.637
You remember the time
we tried to fix the rodeo?

01:13:24.804 --> 01:13:28.516
- Yeah.
- It was Enos that told the Dukes about it.

01:13:28.975 --> 01:13:32.478
Then we tried to spread those rumors
about the Mad Cow Disease...

01:13:32.645 --> 01:13:36.816
...so my chicken factories
would make a little more profit.

01:13:36.983 --> 01:13:39.485
It was Enos that told the Duke boys.

01:13:39.652 --> 01:13:42.280
So you want them Duke boys
to come out here?

01:14:14.687 --> 01:14:19.859
Enos, where's Boss Hogg and Rosco?

01:14:20.026 --> 01:14:22.445
They're at your farm.

01:14:22.987 --> 01:14:25.114
Thank you, Enos.

01:14:29.827 --> 01:14:32.288
That might be a new record.

01:14:38.169 --> 01:14:40.671
What? Okay, thanks, Daisy.

01:14:42.632 --> 01:14:44.008
He's at our farm.

01:14:46.344 --> 01:14:48.471
Hey. Hey, look, there's Prickett.

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:51.391
- So?
- He can help us.

01:14:51.557 --> 01:14:54.394
He don't care about Hazzard.
He's getting paid to be here.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.813
Oh, man, you're wrong.
He's from here.

01:15:04.153 --> 01:15:07.115
- You out of your goddamn mind?
- Hey, Billy.

01:15:07.281 --> 01:15:11.119
- Boss Hogg's gonna strip-mine Hazzard.
- Just hold your horses.

01:15:11.285 --> 01:15:14.497
- Who's stripping?
- He's playing you, man.

01:15:14.664 --> 01:15:17.291
- He paid you to come and race...
- Just save your breath.

01:15:17.458 --> 01:15:20.294
- I already know.
- You already know?

01:15:21.879 --> 01:15:25.425
- But this is your hometown.
- I hate to break this to you, Bo-Bo...

01:15:25.591 --> 01:15:28.219
...but this place is a shithole.

01:15:28.386 --> 01:15:32.348
If it wasn't a strip mine,
it'd be a strip mall.

01:15:34.016 --> 01:15:38.521
Kind of like one of them outlets where
everything's reduced prices and...

01:15:38.688 --> 01:15:42.358
Hell, they don't even have an Outback
Steakhouse down here. Am I right?

01:15:42.525 --> 01:15:45.403
- Right as pie, Billy.
- Saddle up, Dil.

01:15:49.741 --> 01:15:54.078
Look at the bright side, Bo-Bo. At least
you didn't have to race me today.

01:15:54.245 --> 01:15:58.082
Because I would've left that little Tonka
toy you drive at the starting stripe.

01:15:58.249 --> 01:16:00.585
- Tonka.
- I'm gonna kill him.

01:16:00.752 --> 01:16:03.046
Hey, hey, hey!

01:16:03.212 --> 01:16:05.465
- What about Uncle Jesse?
- Wanna ride this stag?

01:16:05.631 --> 01:16:09.010
- You wanna rodeo with this clown?
- Uncle Jesse's old, Luke.

01:16:09.177 --> 01:16:10.845
He's had a good run.

01:16:11.012 --> 01:16:16.642
Besides, if he passes, God have mercy
on his soul, we get the farm.

01:16:19.645 --> 01:16:22.732
I'm just playing with you, man.
Let's go get him.

01:16:34.327 --> 01:16:36.037
They're here.

01:16:42.752 --> 01:16:44.128
Cooter, you ready out there?

01:16:44.295 --> 01:16:47.507
<i>You get Rosco out of there,
Daisy and I'll take care of the rest.</i>

01:16:47.673 --> 01:16:50.760
What do you say we smoke
the varmint out of his hole?

01:16:53.471 --> 01:16:56.808
Hey, Rosco, come on out,
you fat son of a bitch!

01:17:03.147 --> 01:17:05.691
- Cletus, get your butt out there.
- Thank you, Rosco.

01:17:19.914 --> 01:17:22.667
- Let me know if you're gonna puke!
- Oh, you'll know first!

01:17:29.841 --> 01:17:33.219
All right, boys! Y'all come on
out of there with your hands up.

01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:37.223
- Hey, Rosco!
- Hi, Boo-Boo.

01:17:48.067 --> 01:17:50.361
I didn't know we had so many pigs
on the farm.

01:18:02.206 --> 01:18:05.376
- I call this "painting the fence."
- I think you missed a spot.

01:18:09.422 --> 01:18:11.382
Look out, look out!

01:18:11.632 --> 01:18:13.968
- You gonna get us out of here?
- I'm working on it!

01:18:29.942 --> 01:18:32.028
Man, they're hauling ass, pick it up!

01:18:42.121 --> 01:18:44.499
- You gonna make that?
- I'm planning on it.

01:18:47.585 --> 01:18:49.462
Hold on, Luke.

01:18:53.174 --> 01:18:54.926
I'll go in this direction now!

01:19:08.648 --> 01:19:11.442
All right, Jesse. I'm arresting those...

01:19:12.026 --> 01:19:15.113
Jesse? Jesse?

01:19:18.241 --> 01:19:20.243
Courthouse.

01:19:28.626 --> 01:19:32.255
Attention!
Attention, good people of Hazzard!

01:19:32.422 --> 01:19:35.299
Life as we know it is about to end.

01:19:35.466 --> 01:19:40.263
As we speak, dark forces are conspiring
to strip-mine our land.

01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:42.765
Follow me to the courthouse,
and we'll save you!

01:19:44.642 --> 01:19:48.771
Yeah, right, Sheev. Last year
the CIA was brainwashing our cows.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.857
Get a job, man.

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:53.985
Hey, Sheev. Sheev.

01:19:54.152 --> 01:19:58.197
- Go back to your spaceship.
- I'm serious. Come on!

01:19:59.323 --> 01:20:00.408
Bye, Sheev.

01:20:14.797 --> 01:20:16.716
It might be good
if you helped out here.

01:20:16.883 --> 01:20:19.010
- Hell, move over, I'll drive.
- No way.

01:20:19.177 --> 01:20:21.054
I'm still hoping to survive this thing.

01:20:23.014 --> 01:20:24.682
Goddamn it. Son of a bitch.

01:20:28.019 --> 01:20:30.980
I like the way you think, cuz.
Yeah, boy!

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.042
Hold on.

01:21:05.973 --> 01:21:08.309
Lost Sheep, Lost Sheep,
are you out there?

01:21:08.935 --> 01:21:10.103
Go for Lost Sheep.

01:21:10.269 --> 01:21:12.480
<i>- Free and clear.
- Good.</i>

01:21:12.647 --> 01:21:15.191
Sheev's making sure everyone
goes to the hearing.

01:21:15.358 --> 01:21:17.110
<i>- I'll see you in town.
- Over and out.</i>

01:21:17.276 --> 01:21:18.778
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:21:24.033 --> 01:21:27.912
- Barn door, coming up.
- Yeah, I see it. Hold on!

01:21:50.393 --> 01:21:52.061
The General!

01:21:52.311 --> 01:21:54.021
Let's head to the courthouse!

01:21:58.317 --> 01:22:01.279
End of the World to Lost Sheep,
End of the World to Lost Sheep.

01:22:01.446 --> 01:22:03.448
- Come in, Lost Sheep.
- What do you got?

01:22:03.614 --> 01:22:05.950
- Everybody headed into town?
- That's a negative.

01:22:06.117 --> 01:22:07.577
Repeat, that's a negative.

01:22:07.785 --> 01:22:10.371
No one listened.
They threw hot dogs at us.

01:22:11.205 --> 01:22:14.042
- Did you tell them about the strip mine?
- Of course I did.

01:22:14.625 --> 01:22:17.754
Were you wearing a armadillo helmet
when you told them about it?

01:22:20.131 --> 01:22:21.424
No.

01:22:22.467 --> 01:22:23.926
<i>Okay, Lost Sheep out.</i>

01:22:24.969 --> 01:22:26.596
No one's heading in to town?

01:22:26.804 --> 01:22:30.767
If we don't get to that courthouse
by noon, there ain't gonna be no town.

01:22:33.644 --> 01:22:37.440
- Well, we still got time for Plan B.
- I like Plan B.

01:22:37.607 --> 01:22:38.900
- Plan B.
- Plan B.

01:22:39.067 --> 01:22:41.277
<i>When you're flying by the seat
of your pants...</i>

01:22:41.444 --> 01:22:44.572
<i>... nothing sounds more official
than a Plan B.</i>

01:22:46.157 --> 01:22:48.993
Don't worry, cuz,
I'll get them to the courthouse.

01:23:13.101 --> 01:23:16.354
This emergency hearing
is now in session.

01:23:17.897 --> 01:23:20.066
Rosco, where is everybody?

01:23:21.526 --> 01:23:22.944
I'm here.

01:23:23.611 --> 01:23:24.946
Well, we have until noon.

01:24:05.945 --> 01:24:10.324
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls...

01:24:10.491 --> 01:24:15.413
...it's my honor today
to introduce my friend...

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:21.753
...and the friend of everybody in the
greatest state of the United States...

01:24:24.589 --> 01:24:30.136
...the governor, James T. Applewhite!

01:24:30.386 --> 01:24:32.680
Thank you. Thank you.

01:24:34.015 --> 01:24:35.641
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:24:35.808 --> 01:24:40.813
...welcome to the
70th Annual Hazzard Road Rally!

01:24:43.107 --> 01:24:46.194
Drivers, start your engines!

01:24:57.288 --> 01:25:01.667
Just have a couple piÃ±a coladas
waiting for me at the finish line, Dil.

01:25:01.834 --> 01:25:03.544
Here comes the heat.

01:25:07.548 --> 01:25:09.258
There they go.

01:25:15.306 --> 01:25:17.266
Come on, come on, come on.

01:25:38.246 --> 01:25:40.164
He's in the race!

01:26:11.529 --> 01:26:14.866
It has been confirmed that the
orange car that entered the race...

01:26:15.033 --> 01:26:17.910
...is in fact the same car
that tore up Atlanta this morning.

01:26:18.077 --> 01:26:22.165
<i>It seems that the "orange-car fugitives"
are from right here in Hazzard County.</i>

01:26:22.373 --> 01:26:25.376
State and local authorities
are trying to subdue the vehicle...

01:26:25.543 --> 01:26:27.170
...known as the General Lee.

01:26:27.336 --> 01:26:31.215
Well, General-Lee speaking, I'd say those
cops are in for a pretty tough time.

01:26:31.382 --> 01:26:33.509
I'm Rick Shakely.
Back to you, Marty.

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:42.351
This is Boss Hogg.
The Dukes are on the course.

01:26:42.518 --> 01:26:48.441
<i>I want all available vehicles to shut down
the road to the courthouse!</i>

01:26:48.608 --> 01:26:50.985
- We're gonna need to clear a path.
- You got it.

01:26:54.697 --> 01:26:58.993
Hey, Dil, what's the word
on those CÃ©line Dion tickets?

01:26:59.994 --> 01:27:04.082
Well, of course I wanna go backstage.
Don't be dumb.

01:27:56.384 --> 01:27:57.552
Damn.

01:28:10.815 --> 01:28:14.944
Enos. I want you
down to the courthouse. I...

01:28:16.487 --> 01:28:17.947
Someone moved my car.

01:28:19.824 --> 01:28:23.786
Enos, you dipstick,
did somebody move my car?

01:28:24.328 --> 01:28:27.457
Hell, let's just sack up
and shoot the bastard.

01:28:30.001 --> 01:28:32.628
Holy shit!

01:28:33.129 --> 01:28:35.131
Luke, where the hell are you?

01:28:50.772 --> 01:28:53.691
- Good God almighty.
- It's about time!

01:28:53.858 --> 01:28:56.694
- How's the race going?
- How's it look like it's going?

01:29:44.575 --> 01:29:46.119
Why, you dirty son of a bitch.

01:29:49.914 --> 01:29:51.666
Hey, go easy on that.

01:29:51.833 --> 01:29:55.837
For what I'm getting ready to do,
I don't wanna remember a lot of it.

01:30:02.218 --> 01:30:04.011
You know why tornadoes and blonds...

01:30:04.178 --> 01:30:06.222
...are so much alike?
- No.

01:30:06.389 --> 01:30:11.060
At first, there's a lot of sucking
and blowing, and then you lose your house.

01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:19.026
Know what you get when you cross
a donkey with an onion?

01:30:19.193 --> 01:30:20.737
- No.
- You get a piece of ass...

01:30:20.945 --> 01:30:23.865
...that'll bring a tear to your eye.

01:30:28.786 --> 01:30:30.371
You thinking about throwing it?

01:30:30.538 --> 01:30:32.749
Oh, I'll throw it.
I was thinking about pussy.

01:30:40.548 --> 01:30:42.675
You know why divorces
are so expensive?

01:30:42.842 --> 01:30:45.428
- No.
- Because they're worth it.

01:30:48.389 --> 01:30:50.433
Fire in the hole.

01:30:56.355 --> 01:31:00.109
Hey, Bo, take it home.
The coast is clear.

01:31:12.038 --> 01:31:13.915
Here we go again.

01:31:14.082 --> 01:31:16.250
Okay, I'm gonna get those cops
to follow me.

01:31:16.417 --> 01:31:19.253
When I do, tow those cruisers
out of the way.

01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:21.339
Can do.

01:31:35.395 --> 01:31:38.481
Excuse me, officers.
My car broke down up the street there...

01:31:38.648 --> 01:31:40.942
...and I was wondering
if y'all could help me out.

01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:44.028
Why, yes, ma'am.
We'll be happy to.

01:31:44.195 --> 01:31:47.573
- Oh, you're sweet.
- Let's go.

01:31:48.116 --> 01:31:51.661
Halt! Tough shit, honey.
You go fix your own car.

01:31:51.828 --> 01:31:53.413
Ain't no one going anywhere.

01:31:54.372 --> 01:31:56.499
What the hell are you doing?

01:32:06.759 --> 01:32:08.052
Come on, General.

01:32:39.459 --> 01:32:41.794
Hey, Dil, we got a late arrival!

01:32:51.429 --> 01:32:53.139
Hey, Billy!

01:33:03.107 --> 01:33:05.443
You're gonna pay for that, Bo-Bo.

01:33:09.655 --> 01:33:12.116
I've had just about enough of you.

01:33:24.545 --> 01:33:25.838
Here they come.

01:33:41.771 --> 01:33:44.440
Of course I can feel him on my left!
Of course I can!

01:33:49.362 --> 01:33:52.573
- Where is he getting this from?
- Hey, Billy!

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:54.158
He's playing with me!

01:34:02.083 --> 01:34:04.752
- Come on.
- The General Lee has won the race.

01:34:06.379 --> 01:34:07.964
I want him tested for steroids!

01:34:11.759 --> 01:34:14.804
But Billy Prickett and the General Lee
haven't had quite enough driving.

01:34:15.012 --> 01:34:16.931
They're still going.

01:34:18.391 --> 01:34:20.643
- Come on, y'all!
- We'll interview these guys...

01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:23.896
...if we have to chase after
them ourselves. Tito, start the van.

01:34:24.439 --> 01:34:26.357
Better luck next time, Hogg.

01:34:26.524 --> 01:34:28.067
Let's go, baby.

01:34:35.825 --> 01:34:37.827
Don't go home, really.

01:34:40.038 --> 01:34:42.081
This is Boss Hogg.

01:34:42.248 --> 01:34:47.086
That road better be shut down
tighter than a tick's ass.

01:34:47.754 --> 01:34:50.214
Ten-four. Barricade's in place.

01:34:56.137 --> 01:34:58.264
Rosco, is anyone coming?

01:34:58.848 --> 01:35:02.935
- What, I ain't good enough for you?
- No comment.

01:35:04.395 --> 01:35:06.981
Don't write that down.
Don't write that down.

01:35:07.148 --> 01:35:10.193
- Are they coming?
- Oh, yeah, they're coming.

01:35:10.359 --> 01:35:12.862
<i>We got the whole town headed
to the courthouse.</i>

01:35:14.072 --> 01:35:17.325
<i>- Daisy, we all clear?
- Not exactly.</i>

01:35:17.492 --> 01:35:20.078
"Not exactly" could be a problem.

01:35:20.244 --> 01:35:24.415
<i>Bo? I think we're gonna have
to shoot the moon.</i>

01:35:39.889 --> 01:35:42.392
- What the hell are you doing, Cooter?
- Sorry, officer.

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.560
I heard a pretty lady needed a tow.

01:35:47.688 --> 01:35:50.608
- Cooter.
- I can't hear you.

01:35:50.775 --> 01:35:53.194
Cooter, what the hell are you doing?

01:36:01.244 --> 01:36:03.621
Hey, Billy!

01:36:03.788 --> 01:36:05.873
You think I was born
yesterday, Bo-Bo?

01:36:07.125 --> 01:36:09.127
Oh, shit!

01:36:17.385 --> 01:36:19.095
Holy shit.

01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:38.239
Luke, I made it, but I don't know
how anybody else will.

01:36:38.406 --> 01:36:41.284
That's okay, I got an idea!

01:36:45.121 --> 01:36:46.956
Well, I'll see you on the other side.

01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:04.265
Give me
your goddamn driver's license.

01:37:04.432 --> 01:37:06.184
What license?

01:37:13.024 --> 01:37:15.651
What are we waiting on, judge?
Let's finish this thing.

01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:17.695
Well, I guess it's that time.

01:37:17.862 --> 01:37:20.782
I just can't believe
that nobody wants to object.

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:25.953
All those in favor
of the strip-mining ordinance?

01:37:27.705 --> 01:37:30.083
- They're gonna strip-mine Hazzard?
- Damn straight.

01:37:30.249 --> 01:37:34.629
- How can they do that?
- Don't worry, we're about to stop them.

01:37:35.797 --> 01:37:37.840
All those opposed?

01:37:39.801 --> 01:37:42.428
What the hell is that?
Who locked that door?

01:37:46.891 --> 01:37:49.477
- Oh, man, that's gonna hurt tomorrow.
- Your Honor!

01:37:49.644 --> 01:37:54.148
I think we got some people who might
like to object to this strip-mining issue.

01:37:54.565 --> 01:37:58.027
Okay, all those opposed
to the strip-mining ordinance?

01:38:01.072 --> 01:38:06.828
This court hereby declares that the
strip-mining ordinance is dismissed.

01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:15.378
Thank you much. Thank you, Boss.
Hi, how y'all?

01:38:15.586 --> 01:38:18.339
She might be a little low on gas.

01:38:18.506 --> 01:38:20.466
Take that.

01:38:21.592 --> 01:38:24.971
Were you really gonna strip-mine
Hazzard, Mr. Hogg?

01:38:25.763 --> 01:38:28.349
I was thinking about it.

01:38:29.976 --> 01:38:31.769
- Out of the way.
- Step aside, please.

01:38:31.936 --> 01:38:33.312
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:38:34.689 --> 01:38:36.983
- Get your hands up.
- People, move back.

01:38:37.150 --> 01:38:38.735
Hands up, hands up.

01:38:38.943 --> 01:38:42.321
Okay. Looks like the party's over.

01:38:42.488 --> 01:38:45.575
Damn right it is.
As long as I'm a county commissioner...

01:38:45.742 --> 01:38:48.619
...for the great state of Georgia,
you two are gonna rot...

01:38:48.786 --> 01:38:51.247
...in the penitentiary. Cuff him.

01:38:52.498 --> 01:38:53.791
Let them go!

01:38:54.125 --> 01:38:55.877
Let them go!

01:38:56.044 --> 01:38:59.422
Excuse me, Rick Shakely. I think
the governor has a statement to make.

01:38:59.589 --> 01:39:01.466
- Well, hot dog.
- I do?

01:39:01.632 --> 01:39:04.093
Yes, sir. You wanted to comment
on how these boys...

01:39:04.302 --> 01:39:06.596
...are the heroes
for saving Hazzard County.

01:39:06.763 --> 01:39:09.766
- That's right, governor!
- Come on, governor!

01:39:11.184 --> 01:39:13.144
Certainly, certainly.

01:39:13.311 --> 01:39:16.898
As you know, I've always been
a great friend to the environment.

01:39:17.356 --> 01:39:20.276
And these boys,
they're environmental heroes!

01:39:22.028 --> 01:39:26.157
And because they're heroes, you're
gonna pardon them for all their crimes?

01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:32.747
Moreover, as governor,
I hereby pardon these boys...

01:39:32.914 --> 01:39:36.876
...of any and all offenses against
the great state of Georgia. Go Dogs!

01:39:40.129 --> 01:39:43.800
Governor? I wanna thank you
for pardoning me too.

01:39:43.966 --> 01:39:47.011
- Pardon you for what?
- For this.

01:39:51.808 --> 01:39:54.310
Oh, what the hell. I pardon him too.

01:39:56.521 --> 01:40:00.108
Here's to Hazzard County's
real favorite sons.

01:40:03.611 --> 01:40:06.656
<i>The day had been saved, as they say.</i>

01:40:06.823 --> 01:40:09.492
<i>Hazzard was put back the way it was.</i>

01:40:09.659 --> 01:40:12.370
<i>Boss Hogg had some explaining to do.</i>

01:40:12.537 --> 01:40:15.039
<i>And the Dukes got their farm back
and celebrated...</i>

01:40:15.206 --> 01:40:18.584
<i>... with a good old-fashioned
pig-picking barbecue.</i>

01:40:18.751 --> 01:40:21.838
Hey, Billy. Daisy, I think
you ought to get up there and sing.

01:40:22.046 --> 01:40:25.758
- Oh, no. I only sing in the shower.
- I'll get the water running.

01:40:25.925 --> 01:40:28.386
- Let's get Uncle Jesse to do it.
- Good idea.

01:40:28.553 --> 01:40:31.889
Pauline, where's Uncle Jesse?
We want him to sing a song.

01:40:32.056 --> 01:40:35.226
I think I might know where he is.

01:40:39.355 --> 01:40:40.606
An apple?

01:40:40.898 --> 01:40:43.735
An apple a day
will keep the doctor away, darling.

01:40:43.901 --> 01:40:46.904
Come on, Jesse,
they want you to sing.

01:40:47.071 --> 01:40:50.908
- Real refreshing.
- They are, aren't they?

01:41:00.835 --> 01:41:02.545
It feels like old times again.

01:41:02.754 --> 01:41:06.424
Yeah, except for now we don't
gotta worry about Bo finding out.

01:41:06.591 --> 01:41:10.094
I swear you're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:41:10.261 --> 01:41:13.097
- You're sweet.
- Yeah.

01:41:13.264 --> 01:41:15.433
I would really like to give you
a bath later.

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.810
Clean you up real nice.
Would you like that?

01:41:17.977 --> 01:41:21.189
- I'd like that.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:41:21.355 --> 01:41:25.151
Don't worry about her. She's crazy.

01:41:31.616 --> 01:41:33.201
Hey there, Laurie.

01:41:33.368 --> 01:41:36.412
You forgot to make your delivery
this week, Luke Duke.

01:41:36.954 --> 01:41:40.083
- Go, Bo, go.
- Luke, you man-whore.

01:41:40.833 --> 01:41:43.419
You get back here, you bastard!

01:41:43.628 --> 01:41:45.046
<i>See y'all later.</i>

01:41:59.143 --> 01:42:00.770
Okay, this is A-camera marker.

01:42:00.978 --> 01:42:04.065
- Actually, she's my cousin.
- That don't make a difference to me.

01:42:04.232 --> 01:42:08.236
Hell, long as she's your sister.
What the fuck did I just say?

01:42:13.324 --> 01:42:17.161
Don't you know you're not supposed
to wear white after Labor Day?

01:42:20.123 --> 01:42:22.208
- Come on, cut that out.
- Seann.

01:42:22.375 --> 01:42:24.544
Do I need to mark this thing?

01:42:24.711 --> 01:42:26.087
<i>It's called common markers.</i>

01:42:26.254 --> 01:42:28.631
I wonder if Richard Burton
ever had to do that.

01:43:10.715 --> 01:43:14.302
What the fuck?
That's the kiss you guys are having?

01:43:14.469 --> 01:43:17.346
What the fuck?
I'm a total fucking moron.

01:43:17.513 --> 01:43:20.183
- It gets longer and longer, doesn't it?
- Come on.

01:43:20.349 --> 01:43:23.853
How these boys are the heroes for...
Oh, my Lord.

01:43:24.062 --> 01:43:27.482
Every time I look at her titties,
she loses her line.

01:43:29.525 --> 01:43:32.028
<i>- I love it except for the hair in your eyes.
- I know.</i>

01:43:32.195 --> 01:43:34.155
<i>- How's my hair?
- Okay.</i>

01:43:34.322 --> 01:43:36.449
How'd you miss that?

01:43:36.741 --> 01:43:40.036
<i>- Gonna take your hands off the wheel?
- He showed me his balls.</i>

01:43:40.203 --> 01:43:42.997
Sorry. Okay, okay. We'll do it again.
Okay, keep going.

01:43:43.164 --> 01:43:45.083
For your...

01:43:47.001 --> 01:43:49.879
- Don't tell me, it rhymes with "anus."
- Heinous.

01:43:50.046 --> 01:43:52.340
For your heinous crimes.

01:43:52.507 --> 01:43:55.551
Have you been running this
around the clock, Uncle Jesse?

01:44:05.436 --> 01:44:09.357
Did I say "shit" or "hell" that time?
With "ass" or "dick"? I said "hell"?

01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:14.779
Dang it, a little help. A little help.

01:44:16.114 --> 01:44:18.616
- Cut it.
- Cut.

01:44:18.783 --> 01:44:23.913
Come on, be a bro, be a bro.
Get it away! Come on. Get it away!

01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:25.748
- Move over.
- Hey.

01:44:25.957 --> 01:44:29.210
- There weren't any bananas.
- Oh, that's okay.

01:44:30.211 --> 01:44:34.132
- Where's Bo?
- To hell with Bo, it's Boo!

01:44:34.298 --> 01:44:35.758
Lunch!

01:44:41.055 --> 01:44:42.807
Thank you very much.

01:44:44.684 --> 01:44:47.770
Look at me, I'm flying. I'm flying!

01:44:47.979 --> 01:44:51.399
Oh, it's so much fun. I'm okay
