WEBVTT

00:17.017 --> 00:22.956
>> PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER"
JESSICA RECEIVED THE HALTING HEX

00:22.990 --> 00:24.492
INSIDE THE DEN OF TEMPTATION.

00:24.525 --> 00:30.064
>> ACCEPT THIS TEMPTATION AND
HALTING HEX WILL ALLOW YOU THE

00:30.098 --> 00:31.932
NEXT FOUR EVICTIONS.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.000
OH, MY GOD.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.968
>> SHE WARNED THE HOUSE ABOUT
HER MYSTERIOUS POWER.

00:35.002 --> 00:38.439
>> I'M HAPPY THAT MECHANIC
DECIDED TO GIVE ME THE FINAL

00:38.472 --> 00:43.311
TEMPTATION, THAT I HAVE THE
POWER TO KEEP CODY AND I SAFE

00:43.344 --> 00:44.578
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.847
>> PAUL QUICKLY DOUBTED HER
CLAIM.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.349
>> SOMETHING SOUNDS FISHY.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.817
I'M GOING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF IT.

00:49.850 --> 00:54.422
>> HE CAME UP WITH A PLAN TO
EXPOSE THE TRUTH.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.656
>> I THINK SHE'S BLUFFING.

00:55.689 --> 00:56.857
>> RIGHT.

00:56.890 --> 01:01.562
>> AT THE FIRST-EVER TEMPTATION
COMPETITION, JASON FINISHED

01:01.595 --> 01:05.733
LAST, MAKING HIM A SPECIAL THIRD
NOMINEE.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.469
>> JASON, THAT MEANS YOU WILL BE
ON THE WATCH!

01:08.502 --> 01:16.043
>> THE COWBOY WILL SOON BE
JOINED BY JODY.

01:16.076 --> 01:22.450
>> I'VE NOMINATED YOU, JESSICA
AND CODY.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.551
NOTHING HAS BEEN REVEALED.

01:23.584 --> 01:28.822
>> JESS AND CODY CONFRONTED PAUL
ABOUT HIS NOMINATIONS.

01:28.856 --> 01:32.193
>> WHAT I HAVE IS A NEW THING.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.294
YOU DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.362
>> DUDE, CALM DOWN.

01:34.395 --> 01:38.499
>> AND THE MARINE WENT ON THE
ATTACK.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.101
>> YOU CANNOT TELL JESSICA TO
LOWER HER VOICE.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.303
>> LEAVE THIS ROOM.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.137
LEAVE THIS ROOM.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.672
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT IT?

01:44.705 --> 01:45.573
>> NOTHING.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.640
LEAVE THIS ROOM.

01:46.674 --> 01:50.311
>> JESSICA WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT
HER HOT-HEADED HONEY.

01:50.344 --> 01:54.415
>> AM I GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THIS IN REALITY TOO, YOU

01:54.448 --> 01:59.086
BEING A HOT-HEAD GETTING INTO
FIGHTS WITH EVERYONE?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.087
>> I'M SORRY.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.056
>> YOU'RE NOT CAPABLE OF GIVING
ME WHAT I WANT.

02:03.090 --> 02:08.061
>> NOT WANTING JESS TO USE THE
HEX, PAUL CAME UP WITH A PLAN.

02:08.095 --> 02:14.034
>> I THINK SHE MIGHT LET HIM
KICK HER OUT OF THE GAME.

02:14.067 --> 02:23.110
>> SO THE TROOPS
WENT TO WORK.

02:23.143 --> 02:23.744
>> IT ENSURES THAT WE TRUST YOU.

02:23.777 --> 02:24.312
>> I'M ASSOCIATED WITH YOU.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.546
>> I'M REALLY TORN.

02:25.579 --> 02:26.414
>> FEELING OUT OF OPTIONS, CODY
WANTED TO SACRIFICE HIS GAME.

02:26.447 --> 02:27.014
>> I DON'T WANT HER TO WASTE
THIS ON ME.

02:27.047 --> 02:37.090
>> THAT'S HER BEST CHANCE.

02:37.090 --> 02:42.129
>> THAT'S HER BEST CHANCE.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.297
>> IF I CAN SAVE ON A GRENADE,
SAVE JESSICA'S GAME, I WILL.

02:43.331 --> 02:46.834
>> JESS WASN'T READY TO LET HIM
JUMP ON HIS SWORD.

02:46.867 --> 02:50.938
>> I'D JUMP ON A GRENADE FOR
YOU.

02:50.971 --> 02:56.143
>> I DON'T NEED THAT.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.711
>> PAUL MADE IT RAIN GOLD.

02:57.745 --> 03:01.549
>> I GOT TO SOMEHOW USE THIS
POWER TO ENTICE JESSICA NOT TO

03:01.582 --> 03:06.119
USE HER HEX SO I CAN SEND CODY
OUT OF THIS GAME ONCE AGAIN.

03:06.153 --> 03:11.392
>> HOPING TO TURN JESSICA AND
CODY, PAUL USED AN ACE UP HIS

03:11.425 --> 03:12.560
SLEEVE.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.829
>> IN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF
THIS GAME, CODY TOLD MATT THE

03:15.863 --> 03:20.067
ONLY REASON HE WANTED COULD TEAM
THEM IN THE HOUSE SO THEY WILL

03:20.100 --> 03:21.402
TAKE YOU AND RAVEN OUT.

03:21.435 --> 03:24.638
>> SO SHE CONSIDERED SENDING HER
SHOWMAN OUT THE DOOR.

03:24.672 --> 03:30.344
>> IF I DECIDED NOT TO USE THE
HEX, THERE'S THINGS I WANT IN

03:30.378 --> 03:30.844
EXCHANGE.

03:30.878 --> 03:31.412
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

03:31.445 --> 03:33.914
>> NOT GO ON THE BLOCK.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.216
I WANT WHOEVER WINS TO TAKE OUT
ALEX.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.819
>> SURE, LET'S MAKE THIS DEAL!

03:38.852 --> 03:45.125
>> TONIGHT WILL JESS GO THROUGH
HER PLAN TO CUT CODY OR LET LOVE

03:45.158 --> 03:47.127
PREVAIL AND USE THE HALTING HEX?

03:47.160 --> 03:51.131
PLUS, CALL YOUR FRIENDS, BECAUSE
IT'S GOING TO BE A CRAZY NIGHT.

03:51.164 --> 03:57.738
>> YOU PUT ME ON THE BLOCK!

03:57.771 --> 03:58.506
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID.

03:58.539 --> 04:06.914
>> ALL THIS LIVE ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

04:06.947 --> 04:07.915
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> Julie: GOOD EVENING.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.554
I'M JULIE CHEN.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.155
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER."

04:15.188 --> 04:19.793
THE THREAT OF THE HALTING HEX
HAS MADE THIS ONE OF THE MOST

04:19.827 --> 04:23.130
EXPLOSIVE, MOST DRAMATIC WEEKS
IN THE HISTORY OF THE GAME.

04:23.163 --> 04:26.900
WITH THIS MYSTERIOUS POWER
LOOMING, TENSIONS ARE AT AN

04:26.934 --> 04:29.870
ALL-TIME HIGH.

04:29.903 --> 04:32.873
WILL JESSICA STOP TONIGHT'S
EVICTION KEEPING EVERYONE SAFE

04:32.906 --> 04:36.143
OR WILL SHE KEEP HER DEAL WITH
PAUL, SAVING THE HEX AND LETTING

04:36.176 --> 04:39.347
THE HOUSE AND HER BOYFRIEND CODY
OUT THE FRONT DOOR?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.815
WE'LL SOON FIND OUT.

04:41.849 --> 04:47.555
BUT FIRST PAUL,'S BOMBSHELL NEWS
TO JESSICA HAS LEFT HER AT A

04:47.588 --> 04:49.890
CROSSROADS, TO USE THE HEX OR
NOT TO USE THE HEX.

04:49.923 --> 04:54.928
THAT IS THE QUESTION.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.102
>> CODY AND I HAVE BEEN ON THE
ROCKS A LOT LATELY.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.205
PAUL TOLD ME INFORMATION ABOUT
CODY THAT'S NOT REALLY HELPING.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.007
APPARENTLY CODY TOLD MATT THAT
THE REASON HE WANTED TO KEEP

05:07.040 --> 05:10.277
JASON AND ALEX IN THE HOUSE WAS
SO THEY COULD EVENTUALLY TAKE ME

05:10.310 --> 05:13.080
OUT.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.148
>> WANT TO COME TALK TO ME?

05:15.182 --> 05:20.388
>> I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE THAT
THE INFORMATION THAT HE'S GIVING

05:20.421 --> 05:25.493
ME IS 100% FACTUAL, BECAUSE PAUL
LIKES TO PLAY MIND GAMES.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.696
>> WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT
WHAT CODY SAID TO YOU?

05:28.729 --> 05:29.597
>> CODY SAID TO ME?

05:29.630 --> 05:30.998
>> YEAH.

05:31.031 --> 05:37.471
WHAT DID CODY SAY TO YOU AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE GAME?

05:37.505 --> 05:42.209
>> UMM, I DON'T REALLY WANT TO
GET INTO IT, TO BE HONEST WITH

05:42.242 --> 05:43.076
YOU.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.144
WE DON'T NEED TO DISCUSS THIS
RIGHT NOW.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.014
>> APPARENTLY IT'S SOMETHING I
NEED TO KNOW.

05:47.047 --> 05:50.518
>> IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S
RELEVANT AT THIS POINT, THOUGH.

05:50.551 --> 05:53.186
>> WHY IS IT NOT RELEVANT
ANYMORE?

05:53.220 --> 05:56.557
>> FIVE WEEKS LATER, AND THINGS
HAVE CHANGED.

05:56.590 --> 06:09.169
>> SO WHAT DID H DID HE GET SAY
BEGINNING?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.572
IF YOU WANT DON'T WANT TO TELL
ME, THAT'S FINE.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.607
IF YOU WANT TO TELL ME, THAT'S
FINE TOO.

06:13.641 --> 06:14.174
>> I DON'T WANT TO.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.043
>> FINE.

06:16.076 --> 06:16.977
THANK YOU.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.112
I KNOW THAT A LOT HAS CHANGED,
BUT I'M ANGRY.

06:19.146 --> 06:28.355
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO CODY AND
GET HIS SIDE OF THE STORY.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.626
>> WHEN MY MOM WATCHES THIS
SHOW, IS SHE GOING TO LOVE YOU

06:32.660 --> 06:34.294
OR HATE YOU?

06:34.327 --> 06:36.797
>> WHY DO YOU ASK THAT?

06:36.830 --> 06:38.466
WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE TELLING
YOU?

06:38.499 --> 06:50.077
>> UMM, THAT YOUR ORIGINAL
ALLEGIANCE TO JASON AND ALEX, SO

06:50.110 --> 06:54.948
THAT THEY WOULD BE THE ONES TO
TAKE OUT RAVEN AND I.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.584
>> NEVER.

06:56.617 --> 07:01.822
JESSICA, I SWEAR ON EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE NEVER HAD AN ALLIANCE

07:01.855 --> 07:04.224
WITH THEM, EVER TO TAKE YOU OUT,
OR --

07:04.257 --> 07:09.229
>> YOU NEVER SAID WE SHOULD BEAT
JASON AND ALEX IN THE GAME, TO

07:09.262 --> 07:11.031
TAKE OUT RAVEN AND JESS?

07:11.064 --> 07:12.332
>> NOT AT ALL, NOT AT ALL.

07:12.365 --> 07:17.137
I MEAN, ARE YOU LOOKING AT
WORKING WITH ALEX AND JASON LIKE

07:17.170 --> 07:17.971
LONG TERM?

07:18.005 --> 07:20.674
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD GO AFTER
JESS.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.310
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD GO AFTER
RAVEN.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.145
SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE THEM OUT.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.147
CAN'T BE US.

07:27.180 --> 07:33.420
ALL THEY HAVE IN THIS GAME IS MY
LOYALTY.

07:33.453 --> 07:40.728
I'D DO ANYTHING IN THIS GAME FOR
THEM.

07:40.761 --> 07:50.070
>> YOU'RE LYING TO MY FACE.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.172
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
>> WHAT?

07:52.205 --> 07:53.273
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

07:53.306 --> 07:55.275
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:55.308 --> 07:55.643
CODY?

07:55.676 --> 07:56.443
OKAY, COOL.

07:56.476 --> 08:01.515
GOOD TALK.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.154
>> JESSICA LAID OUT A DEAL WHERE
SHE WOULD POTENTIALLY CONSIDER

08:07.187 --> 08:12.192
NOT USING THE HEX, AND SEND CODY
HOME A SECOND TIME THIS GAME.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.161
SHE ASKED ME TO GET EVERYBODY ON
BOARD.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.230
SO SURE, I'LL GET EVERYONE TO
AGREE TO YOUR TERMS.

08:17.264 --> 08:22.870
LET'S MAKE THIS DEAL HAPPEN.

08:22.903 --> 08:33.480
>> HER TEMPTATION IS, IF SHE
USES THE HEX, SAID THE ONLY WAY

08:33.513 --> 08:36.516
SHE WOULDN'T USE THE HEX, IF
SHE'S GUARANTEED SHE'S NOT ON

08:36.550 --> 08:43.256
THE BLOCK FOR TWO WEEKS, AND SHE
WANTS ALEX OUT OF THIS GAME.

08:43.290 --> 08:49.697
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GO, YEAH,
OKAY, SURE.

08:49.730 --> 08:53.701
>> SO NOW I GOT TO LET THE REST
OF MY SIDE KNOW, ESPECIALLY

08:53.734 --> 08:56.503
ALEX, BECAUSE THIS DEAL INVOLVES
HER.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.107
>> IS THAT THE ONLY WAY I WON'T
USE MY HEX, IF I'M PROMISED

09:00.140 --> 09:01.341
SAFETY FOR TWO WEEKS.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.643
SHE SAID TAKING ALEX OUT.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.377
>> JESSICA WANTS ME OUT.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.913
NO SURPRISE THERE.

09:05.946 --> 09:09.883
SHE'S WANTED ME OUT SINCE DAY
ONE, BECAUSE JESSICA IS THE

09:09.917 --> 09:12.986
TYPICAL MEAN GIRL, INSECURE,
JEALOUS, AND KNOWS I'M A BETTER

09:13.020 --> 09:13.887
ATHLETE THAN SHE IS.

09:13.921 --> 09:17.758
SO BRING IT.

09:17.791 --> 09:21.528
>> AS FAR AS MARK AND ELENA
GOES, I WANT THEM TO FEEL

09:21.561 --> 09:24.464
THEY'RE IN ON PLAN, SO I'LL TELL
THEM ABOUT IT.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.668
WHAT I CAN'T TELL THEM IS WE
HAVE NO REAL INTENTION OF

09:27.701 --> 09:29.937
SENDING ALEX HOME.

09:29.970 --> 09:37.778
>> JESSICA WON'T USE THE HEX,
AND CAN SEND CODY HOME, AS LONG

09:37.811 --> 09:41.248
AS OF US AGREE WE'LL TAKE ALEX
OUT.

09:41.281 --> 09:47.487
>> I'VE BEEN TRYING TO BUILD A
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH CODY, BUT

09:47.520 --> 09:50.991
IT'S BUILT A WEDGE BETWEEN ME
AND ELENA.

09:51.024 --> 09:55.262
IF IT MEANS HE'S OUT TO GET
CLOSE WITH ELENA AGAIN, THEN I'M

09:55.295 --> 10:01.534
ON BOARD.

10:01.568 --> 10:07.775
>> I CAN MAKE WHAT YOU WANT
HAPPEN, GUARANTEED.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.142
>> ALL RIGHT.

10:09.176 --> 10:12.980
>> IF I CAN PULL THIS OFF, GET
JESSICA NOT TO USE THE HEX, IT

10:13.013 --> 10:16.149
MIGHT BE THE BIGGEST MOVE I'VE
EVER MADE IN THIS GAME EVER.

10:16.183 --> 10:26.226
>> GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT.

10:26.226 --> 10:35.235
>> GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.537
>> AM I PERSON YOU THOUGHT I
WAS?

10:37.570 --> 10:43.176
>> I HAVE A THOUSAND PERCENT
TRUST AND LOYALTY IN YOU, LIKE A

10:43.210 --> 10:44.144
THOUSAND PERCENT.

10:44.177 --> 10:54.221
YOU'RE INCREDIBLE ON SO MANY
LEVELS.

10:54.221 --> 11:03.964
YOU'RE INCREDIBLE ON SO MANY
LEVELS.

11:03.997 --> 11:11.705
>> DO YOU NOT WANT TO BE WITH ME
ANYMORE?

11:11.739 --> 11:19.012
>> YOU SHOULDN'T.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.049
>> ARE YOU DONE WITH THE GAME,
OR ARE YOU DONE WITH ME?

11:22.082 --> 11:28.421
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

11:28.455 --> 11:38.498
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT, I WANT
TO KNOW

11:38.498 --> 11:46.006
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT, I WANT
TO KNOW

11:46.039 --> 11:48.876
I TRIED EVERYTHING.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.143
I HAVEN'T COMMITTED TO THIS DEAL
YET WITH PAUL, BECAUSE IT COMES

11:50.177 --> 11:51.378
DOWN TO WHETHER CODY AND I HAVE
MORE FIGHT IN US.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.445
THIS DEAL COULD SEAL CODY'S FATE
IN THE GAME, BUT NOT TAKING IT

11:52.479 --> 11:56.750
COULD POTENTIALLY SEAL MINE.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.453
>> KUMBAYA?

12:00.487 --> 12:04.958
>> KUMBAYA BIG STYLE.

12:04.992 --> 12:07.995
JESSICA AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING,
AND IN ORDER FOR HER TO FEEL

12:08.028 --> 12:11.398
COMFORTABLE NOT TO USE HER HEX
THIS WEEK, SHE WANTS TWO THINGS,

12:11.431 --> 12:16.103
WHICH I THINK ALL OF US ARE ON
BOARD WITH.

12:16.136 --> 12:21.909
>> IF I AM GOING TO AVOID USING
THE HEX, THE ONLY THING I WANT

12:21.942 --> 12:25.545
IN EXCHANGE IS TWO WEEKS OF NOT
BEING ON THE BLOCK, PERIOD, AND

12:25.578 --> 12:28.949
I WANT ALEX OUT OF THIS GAME.

12:28.982 --> 12:37.424
SO WHOEVER WINS THE HOH, I WANT
THAT TO BE THE TARGET.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.591
>> DONE.

12:38.625 --> 12:42.329
>> THERE'S A LOT OF FACTORS
WEIGHING IN ON THIS DECISION.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.765
IF CODY STAYS, I HAVE MY ALLIES
STILL IN THIS HOUSE.

12:45.799 --> 12:49.036
IF CODY GOES, I'LL DEFINITELY
GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS FOR MY

12:49.069 --> 12:50.203
GAME.

12:50.237 --> 12:53.406
GETTING ALEX OUT OF THIS HOUSE
IS WAY TOO JUICY TO PASS UP.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.343
IF I'M GIVING YOU GUYS THIS, I
WANT HER OUT.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.377
>> DEAL.

12:57.410 --> 13:05.018
>> DONE.

13:05.052 --> 13:08.055
>> DID I REALLY PULL THIS OFF?

13:08.088 --> 13:11.791
SHE'S GOT TO USE THE HEX AND WE
GET TO GET CODY OUT?

13:11.825 --> 13:16.096
WHEW!

13:21.401 --> 13:31.444
>> EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR THE
VETO MEETING.

13:31.444 --> 13:37.817
>> EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR THE
VETO MEETING.

13:37.851 --> 13:42.455
>> THIS IS VETO MEETING.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.057
I'VE NOMINATED CODY AND JESSICA
FOR EVICTION.

13:44.091 --> 13:48.661
BECAUSE JASON CAME IN LAST PLACE
IN THE TEMPTATION COMPETITION,

13:48.695 --> 13:49.930
HE'S THE THIRD NOMINEE.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.632
IF HE'S TAKEN OFF THE BLOCK WITH
THE VETO, THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT

13:52.665 --> 13:53.766
NOMINEE.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.636
>> I WANT TO TAKE JASON OUT TO
ENSURE HE DOESN'T GO HOME.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.439
IF I PULL JESSICA OFF THE BLOCK,
MAYBE SHE FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE

13:59.472 --> 14:00.640
WITH OUR DEAL.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.276
MAYBE THAT WILL BE JUST ENOUGH
TO CONVINCE JESSICA NOT TO USE

14:03.310 --> 14:04.444
THE HEX.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.446
>> I WANT TO GIVE EVERYONE A
CHANCE TO TELL ME WHY I SHOULD

14:06.479 --> 14:08.348
USE THE VETO TO SAVE THEM.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.050
JASON, YOU GO FIRST.

14:10.083 --> 14:17.991
>> I AM UP AGAINST PEOPLE THAT
MAY NOT HAVE A GENUINE GOOD

14:18.025 --> 14:20.860
PERSONALITY, GENUINELY DON'T
LIKE PEOPLE, AND GENUINELY DON'T

14:20.894 --> 14:22.595
WANT TO PARTICIPATE.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.764
AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER ONE
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

14:24.797 --> 14:28.235
I WOULD LOVE IT IF YOU WOULD USE
THE VETO ON ME TO PULL ME DOWN

14:28.268 --> 14:32.472
AND USE ME AS A VOTE AGAINST THE
TARGET.

14:32.505 --> 14:36.109
THAT WOULD FREE UP THE MIDDLE
PERSON SO SHE HAS ROOM TO WORK

14:36.143 --> 14:37.177
AS WELL.

14:37.210 --> 14:42.549
PLEASE, PAUL, USE THE VETO ON ME
TO PULL ME DOWN.

14:42.582 --> 14:47.955
>> JESSICA, NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

14:47.988 --> 14:53.360
>> WORLD PEACE.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.561
>> CODY, NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.397
>> I HAVE NO SPEECH.

14:57.430 --> 15:01.468
>> WELL, THAT'S SHOCKING.

15:01.501 --> 15:14.614
>> I'VE DECIDED TO USE THE POWER
VETO ON JASON.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.617
>> YEAH, BUDDY.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.620
YEAH!

15:20.653 --> 15:33.500
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.803
>> THANK YOU, BUDDY, I DIDN'T
KNOW IF YOU WERE GOING TO DO

15:36.836 --> 15:37.570
THAT OR NOT.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.772
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY
OBVIOUS.

15:39.806 --> 15:42.209
>> STUD MUFFIN.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.578
>> I MADE THIS DEAL WITH THE
MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE, HOWEVER

15:45.612 --> 15:49.782
I'M NEVER GOING TO BE OKAY WITH
ANYBODY VERBALLY ATTACKING CODY.

15:49.816 --> 15:53.520
SO EVEN IF HE'S GOING HOME I'M
NOT GOING TO STAND FOR IT.

15:53.553 --> 15:57.257
>> ALL OF THAT WAS VERY
ENTERTAINING.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.225
>> YEAH.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.628
MAKING A MOCKERY OF THE GAME IS
REALLY FUNNY.

16:01.661 --> 16:05.265
>> COME ON, JESSICA, I THOUGHT
WE HAD A DEAL, BUT YOU JUST

16:05.298 --> 16:09.136
STANDING UP THERE DISRESPECTING
ME, LAUGHING THROUGHOUT THE VETO

16:09.169 --> 16:12.172
MEETING, REALLY MAKES ME WONDER
IF THIS DEAL IS ON OR IF IT'S

16:12.205 --> 16:12.872
OFF.

16:12.905 --> 16:20.113
>> MAKING A MOCKERY OF HIMSELF.

16:21.881 --> 16:25.618
Julie: UP NEXT, THINGS GET
HEATED WHEN JESSICA'S CONFIDENCE

16:25.652 --> 16:26.719
IS SHAKEN.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.755
THEN WILL THERE BE A LIVE VOTE
AND EVICTION.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.864
WITH THE HOUSE IN FLUX, ANYTHING
COULD HAPPEN.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.119
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
WELCOME BACK TO "BIG BROTHER."

16:59.152 --> 17:03.356
JESSICA MAY HAVE AGREED TO NOT
USE THE HEX, BUT WILL THE HOUSE

17:03.390 --> 17:11.998
BE ABLE TO WIN HER TRUST AS MUCH
AS CODY HAS WON HER HEART?

17:12.031 --> 17:22.075
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO
HAPPEN?

17:22.075 --> 17:29.416
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK'S GOING TO
HAPPEN?

17:29.449 --> 17:29.982
>> GUARANTEED.

17:30.016 --> 17:30.817
>> LOST WEEKS.

17:30.850 --> 17:31.751
I'M TELLING YOU WHAT THAT MEANS.

17:31.784 --> 17:32.985
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

17:33.019 --> 17:33.620
>> THAT'S HEAVY.

17:33.653 --> 17:34.421
>> IT IS HEAVY.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.855
>> I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT
HEAVY.

17:35.888 --> 17:40.560
>> YOU CAN PUT YOUR HAND, PUNCH
LIKE A BRASS KNUCKLE, PUT YOUR

17:40.593 --> 17:43.796
FINGERS THROUGH THERE, AND THEN
BOOM.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.965
>> THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:45.998 --> 17:46.666
I LIKE IT.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.000
>> THANK YOU.

17:48.034 --> 17:51.738
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, KEVY.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.207
>> CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A
SECOND?

17:54.241 --> 17:55.408
>> YEAH.

>> LISTEN, WHEN I WALK INTO A
ROOM, AND I SEE JASON GO LIKE

18:03.015 --> 18:04.951
THIS --
>> OH, NO, HE'S TALKING TO

18:04.984 --> 18:06.119
KEVIN.

>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT, BUT WHEN YOU'RE

18:07.687 --> 18:10.823
ASKING ME TO --

18:10.857 --> 18:13.393
>> NO, NO, NO.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.663
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS
WERE TALKING ABOUT, BUT IT LOOKS

18:16.696 --> 18:17.230
REALLY BAD.

18:17.264 --> 18:17.964
>> NO.

18:17.997 --> 18:22.269
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE VETO.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.536
>> WAIT.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.739
I'M LETTING YOU KNOW, THAT WAS
REALLY SKETCHY.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.076
THE LAST THING UNDER WANT FOR ME
IS TO FEEL THAT WAY.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.379
>> LET ME TALK TO YOU.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.480
>> NO.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.683
I NEED A SECOND, BECAUSE THAT
LITERALLY PISSED ME OFF.

18:36.716 --> 18:37.817
>> I'M SORRY.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.786
>> IT LOOKED REALLY BAD.

18:39.819 --> 18:54.467
>> JESSICA.

>> CAN I TALK TO YOU, PLEASE?

18:58.505 --> 19:05.678
PLEASE, PLEASE.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.248
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HE WAS
DOING.

COMFORTABLE.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.224
NOTHING IS GOING ON.

>> CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

19:18.558 --> 19:19.426
>> YES.

19:19.459 --> 19:22.995

REASON.

IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO
CONVINCE ME NOT TO INDUCE THE

20:35.535 --> 20:42.208
HEX, HE'S GOING TO FREAK OUT.

AND KEVIN, JASON WENT LIKE THIS,

20:50.583 --> 20:52.118
AND SHE "IDN'T APPRECIATE IT.

BUT FROM MY OBSERVATION IT SEEMS

21:33.793 --> 21:34.394
LIKE YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN
THIS DEAL ANYMORE.

21:34.427 --> 21:35.161

>> GO OUT THERE WITH THE POTS
AND PLANS PANS, AND KEEP THE PAR

26:41.233 --> 26:41.968
GOING.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.169
WE GOT MORE QUESTIONS FOR
JESSICA.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.571
>> I HATE BEING THE CENTER OF
ATTRACTION.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.474
>> YOU ARE A DISGUSTING HUMAN
BEING.

26:48.507 --> 26:53.112
YOUR PERSONALITY SUCKS, AS MUCH
AS EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT YOU

26:53.145 --> 26:54.080
SUCK.

26:54.113 --> 26:57.149
YOU WANT TO CALL PEOPLE
DISGUSTING OR COWARDS.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.184
YOU GROWN BABY.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.720
LITTLE MAN SYNDROME, THAT'S WHAT
YOU HAVE.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.555
LITTLE MAN SYNDROME!

27:03.589 --> 27:06.659
>> ALL MY DOGS ARE BARKING.

27:06.693 --> 27:09.829
>> I DIDN'T CALL THEM DOGS.

27:09.862 --> 27:14.500
CALLED THEM GROUPIES.

27:14.533 --> 27:17.103
>> THIS IS EMBARRASSING FOR
EVERYBODY HONESTLY.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.237
IT'S A DISASTER.

27:18.270 --> 27:21.007
IT'S NOT WHAT MY GAME IS BASED
ON.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.743
I REALLY WISHED WE WOULD HAVE
TRIED A DIFFERENT TACTIC.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.411
THIS IS NOT OUR FINEST MOMENT.

27:25.444 --> 27:31.317
>> HOW ABOUT YOU TEACH CODY THE
WORD "LIAR" BECAUSE HE LIED TO

27:31.350 --> 27:32.819
MY FACE, AND SO DID YOU.

27:32.852 --> 27:40.693
>> WHAT KIND OF BIG MAN ARE YOU?

27:40.727 --> 27:44.130
THI>> THIS IS HARASSMENT.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.464
IT'S PATHETIC.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.398
IT'S BULLYING.

27:46.432 --> 27:49.635
>> I HOPE YOU'RE WORTH $500,000
TO JESSICA.

27:49.668 --> 28:03.215
THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE DATE.

28:03.249 --> 28:09.188

>> IF THIS IS GOING TO BE THE

28:09.221 --> 28:12.158
LIFE WE'LL HAVE, I DON'T WANT IF
I WANT IT.

>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

28:16.462 --> 28:17.830
TALK TO ME.

28:17.864 --> 28:20.933
>> JESS, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

28:20.967 --> 28:23.035
WHATEVER DECISION YOU MAKE, IT'S
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

28:23.069 --> 28:27.539
>> I'M TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT,
HOW MUCH OF IT I CAN STAND.

28:27.573 --> 28:35.081
>> HA-HA!

28:35.114 --> 28:39.418
>> I DON'T WANT TO GIVE
EVERYBODY WHAT THEY WANT, BUT

28:39.451 --> 28:42.521
NOT GIVING THEM WHAT THEY WANT
IS MAKING MY LIFE HARDER.

29:06.913 --> 29:07.980
HER BIG DECISION IS NEXT.

29:08.014 --> 29:08.948
THEN THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD
COMPETITION PLAYS OUT LIVE.

IT'S NOW TIME FOR THE LIVE VOTE
AND EVICTION.

29:40.246 --> 29:43.582
THAT IS UNLESS JESSICA DECIDES
TO USE THE HALTING HEX.

29:43.615 --> 29:49.488
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM
AND FIND OUT WHAT SHE DOES.

29:49.521 --> 29:50.522
HELLO, HOUSEGUESTS.

29:50.556 --> 29:55.027
EVERYONE, IT'S TIME FOR THE LIVE
VOTE AND EVICTION.

29:55.061 --> 30:01.200
JESSICA, CODY, IN JUST MOMENTS
YOUR HOUSEMATES WILL VOTE TO

30:01.233 --> 30:02.468
EVICTION LIVE.

30:02.501 --> 30:05.104
BEFORE THEY DO, YOU HAVE A FINAL
CHANCE TO SWAY THEIR VOTES WITH

30:05.137 --> 30:07.439
ONE BRIEF STATEMENT.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.608
JESSICA, YOU'RE FIRST.

30:09.641 --> 30:14.213
>> WELL, HOUSEGUESTS, ALL OF YOU
HAVE BEEN SO CURIOUS TO KNOW

30:14.246 --> 30:15.647
WHAT MY TEMPTATION IS.

30:15.681 --> 30:17.884
I ONLY SEE FIT TO USE IT.

30:17.917 --> 30:22.521
JULIE, I'M OFFICIALLY UNLEASHING
THE HALTING HEX.

30:22.554 --> 30:27.759
>> THE GREATEST POSITION IS ON
THE BLOCK -- GRAVEST POSITION IS

30:27.793 --> 30:30.829
ON THE BLOCK, BUT THERE IS A WAY
TO HALT THE CLOCK.

30:30.863 --> 30:36.035
SAY THIS SPELL AND YOU WILL HEX
IT.

30:36.068 --> 30:43.575
ON EVICTION NIGHT THERE BE NO
EXIT.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.144
HALTING HEX RISE!

30:45.177 --> 30:47.113
EVICTION NIGHT DIES!

30:47.146 --> 30:49.748
HALTING HEX RISE!

30:49.781 --> 30:52.651
EVICTION NIGHT DIES!

30:52.684 --> 30:54.820
HALTING HEX RISE!

30:54.853 --> 30:56.455
HALTING HEX RISE!

30:56.488 --> 30:57.789
EVICTION NIGHT DIES!

31:01.093 --> 31:02.861
HA-HA-HA!

31:02.895 --> 31:05.031
HA-HA-HA!

31:05.064 --> 31:07.900
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT.

31:07.934 --> 31:13.372
HOUSEGUESTS, I CAN NOW CONFIRM
THAT JESSICA DOES INDEED HOLD A

31:13.405 --> 31:14.606
SPECIAL POWER.

31:14.640 --> 31:19.845
IN THE FINAL DEN OF TEMPTATION,
AMERICA CHOSE TO TEMPT JESSICA

31:19.878 --> 31:22.848
WITH THE HALTING HEX, AND SHE
ACCEPTED IT.

31:22.881 --> 31:29.588
FROM THE MOMENT SHE RECEIVED IT,
THE HALTING HEX GAVE HER THE

31:29.621 --> 31:33.492
POWER TO HALT ONE OF THE NEXT
FOUR EVICTIONS, KEEPING EVERYONE

31:33.525 --> 31:36.262
ON THE BLOCK SAFE.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.797
SHE HAS CHOSEN TO USE THE
HALTING HEX.

31:38.830 --> 31:44.536
SO THAT MEANS SHE HAS STOPPED
THIS EVICTION AND NO ONE IS

31:44.570 --> 31:46.672
LEAVING THE HOUSE TONIGHT.

31:46.705 --> 31:52.244
SO JESSICA AND CODY ARE BOTH
SAFE, AND STILL PLAYING THE "BIG

31:52.278 --> 31:55.614
BROTHER" GAME.

31:55.647 --> 32:00.252
JESSICA, SINCE YOU USED THE
HALTING HEX, THE POWER IS GONE,

32:00.286 --> 32:03.889
AND CANNOT BE USED AGAIN.

32:03.922 --> 32:08.995
I'LL BE BACK TO START THE HEAD

32:09.028 --> 32:09.595
SHORTLY.

32:27.646 --> 32:28.580

32:28.614 --> 32:30.616
>> ACTUALLY THAT MAKES SENSE.

32:30.649 --> 32:36.122
>> MAKES SENSE.

32:36.155 --> 32:39.191
>> WON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO
CHANGE, KEVIN.

32:39.225 --> 32:39.791
>> I DO.

32:39.825 --> 32:43.262
>> WHEN I COME BACK, HOH.

32:43.295 --> 32:47.133
>> I CAN'T GO WITH THIS SUIT ON.

32:47.166 --> 32:50.202
>> LESS THAN 20 MINUTES.

32:50.236 --> 32:53.572
Julie: SO JESSICA HAS USED
THE HALTING HEX, KEEPING CODY'S

32:53.605 --> 32:55.674
