07:25.364 --> 07:26.957

about my future.

wanted to be a teacher?

07:39.911 --> 07:41.327
Right?

07:41.380 --> 07:44.207
Well, this will give me
the financial cushion

07:44.249 --> 07:45.792
to chase that dream, right?

07:45.834 --> 07:47.544
I can, I can teach kids now.

13:13.044 --> 13:14.994
You've created a character

13:15.046 --> 13:17.307
you think you're supposed
to create, but, Marty,

13:17.349 --> 13:19.976
really, the best D&D
characters are personal.

13:20.018 --> 13:21.794
They're extensions of ourselves,

13:21.836 --> 13:23.813
of who we are, who we want to be.

13:23.855 --> 13:24.814
Our hopes and fantasies.

13:24.856 --> 13:26.672
So come on, Marty.

13:26.725 --> 13:28.674
Dig deep.

13:28.727 --> 13:30.620

That's great.

13:41.539 --> 13:43.149
All right. (CHUCKLES)

13:43.191 --> 13:45.485
So for character traits, let's
write down "combative,"

13:45.527 --> 13:46.536
uh, "short-tempered."

13:46.578 --> 13:48.528
Hey, Doug, dial it back a thousand,

13:48.580 --> 13:51.708
or I'm gonna punch you right
in your fucking face.

13:51.750 --> 13:53.076
Oh, this looks like fun.

13:53.118 --> 13:54.744
- Do you mind if I join in?
- I do.

13:54.786 --> 13:58.081
My character is a dwarf
with a mangy white beard,

13:58.123 --> 13:59.682
who's constantly sneezing,

13:59.724 --> 14:02.001
and I always whistle while I work.

14:02.043 --> 14:03.336
- I know this guy.
- (SCOFFS)

14:03.378 --> 14:04.670
Okay, you know nothing, all right?

14:04.712 --> 14:06.462
Because dwarves are actually
very strong fighters

14:06.514 --> 14:08.965
and incredibly adept
at deflecting magic.

14:09.017 --> 14:11.361
Not like those shitheads who
hang out with Snow White.

14:18.393 --> 14:20.686
into Davis/Dexter's budget allocations,

14:20.728 --> 14:23.539
and you know their defendable
ratio of R&D to marketing?

14:23.581 --> 14:25.942
- Not so defendable?
- (CLYDE) Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:25.984 --> 14:27.610
Those books are so cooked.

14:27.652 --> 14:29.445
Every department has their
hands in R&D's pockets.

14:29.487 --> 14:30.446

14:30.488 --> 14:31.781
Do tell.

14:31.823 --> 14:33.082

14:33.124 --> 14:36.075

some very cool TV spots.

14:36.127 --> 14:37.720
And there was a Hawaiian boondoggle

some very ethical doctors.

14:43.084 --> 14:44.710
Huh.

14:44.752 --> 14:48.671
Davis/Dexter would take a serious PR hit

14:48.723 --> 14:50.840
if this were to become public knowledge,

14:50.892 --> 14:53.176
but, as citizens, we do have a duty

14:53.228 --> 14:55.772
to protect the civic interest.

14:55.814 --> 14:58.274
Oh, I'm so sorry. Doug, did you
just smile at the word "duty"?

14:58.316 --> 14:59.776
No.

14:59.818 --> 15:01.477
- No?
- No.

15:01.519 --> 15:04.814
Gentlemen, I believe we
have found the final piece

15:04.856 --> 15:06.416
that makes us undeniable.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.067
- Sir Clyde.
- (CLYDE) Yeah.

15:08.109 --> 15:09.735
Do you still have a
friend at the <i> Journal?</i>

15:09.777 --> 15:11.287
- Yes, sir.
- Call him right away.

15:11.329 --> 15:12.612
I will...

15:12.664 --> 15:14.991
just as soon as you call Klare,

15:15.033 --> 15:16.592
♪ waiting,

15:16.634 --> 15:18.995
♪ silence-is-not-golden,

15:19.037 --> 15:20.580
♪ protect-your-heart.

15:20.622 --> 15:22.805
And then about 30 ♪blesseds.

15:27.178 --> 15:29.472
So I should call my guy.

15:29.514 --> 15:31.841
Doug, I'm-a need a rough
deck by tomorrow morning,

15:31.883 --> 15:33.176
you fucking nerd.

15:33.218 --> 15:35.945
Uh, kind of have my
hands full here, Clyde.

15:35.987 --> 15:37.580
With a dragon?

15:37.622 --> 15:39.682
You know what, it might be a
better allocation of resources

15:39.724 --> 15:41.390
if you did the decks.
What do you think, Marty?

15:41.442 --> 15:43.059
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Go handle it, Clyde.

15:43.111 --> 15:44.727
I have tickets to see
Tame Impala with Kelsey.

15:44.779 --> 15:47.156
Oh, Tame Impala, geez.

15:47.198 --> 15:48.658
Do they know anything
about regression models?

15:48.700 --> 15:50.159
- Maybe they could hook you up.
- (DOUG) Yeah.

15:50.201 --> 15:52.795
Tess represents a pretty big
piece of business, Clyde.

15:52.837 --> 15:55.131
You didn't even know
who the fuck she was.

15:55.173 --> 15:57.800
You know, I think unconsciously I did.

15:57.842 --> 15:59.669
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Yeah, I did.

15:59.711 --> 16:01.537
(CLYDE) Unconsciously you did?

16:01.579 --> 16:03.206
So you might want to, uh...

16:03.248 --> 16:04.680
Ticktock.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.543
(CLYDE) Come on, Marty.

16:07.585 --> 16:08.544
Ticktock.

16:08.586 --> 16:09.545
Marty, please, come on.

16:09.587 --> 16:10.720
- Tick-the-fuck-tock.
- For real?

16:13.424 --> 16:16.385
<i>♪ Slow music ♪</i>

16:19.063 --> 16:21.013
Guessing you saw the <i> Journal</i> article.

16:21.065 --> 16:23.015
It might not seem so at first glance,

16:23.067 --> 16:24.016
but this is a good thing.

16:24.068 --> 16:25.728
It's actually a great thing.

16:25.770 --> 16:27.937
The abuse predates you,

16:27.989 --> 16:29.605
which allows you to
play the white knight,

16:29.657 --> 16:31.607
and... it'll give us more room to do

16:31.659 --> 16:33.442
what we really should be doing anyway:

16:33.494 --> 16:35.071
bringing research to the fore,

16:35.113 --> 16:37.340
leaving Novax in our wake.

16:37.382 --> 16:40.326
Davis/Dexter made its
name around innovation.

16:40.368 --> 16:41.994
I believe in light of the article,

16:42.036 --> 16:45.748
the board will show the wisdom
of reallocating its resources.

16:45.790 --> 16:47.206
Great.

16:47.258 --> 16:49.258
I will make sure Marty and his
team are on the same page.

16:50.895 --> 16:52.088
What's this?

16:52.130 --> 16:54.056
It's your letter of resignation.

16:54.098 --> 16:55.424
And this is a joke?

16:55.466 --> 16:57.426
To ensure an orderly transition,

16:57.468 --> 16:58.928
your last day will be next Friday.

16:58.970 --> 17:01.364
Everything Mark said is make-believe.

17:01.406 --> 17:02.532
You-you and your wife

17:02.574 --> 17:04.473
had us over for dinner,
for Christ's sakes.

17:04.525 --> 17:05.685
Well, make-believe or not,

17:05.727 --> 17:07.369
there's always a swirl
of drama around you.

17:07.412 --> 17:08.938
Well, I didn't create this drama.

17:08.980 --> 17:10.373
You opened the door to it.

17:10.415 --> 17:13.693
A sociopath accuses me

17:13.734 --> 17:16.362
of sexual intimidation
to rip off your company,

17:16.404 --> 17:18.247
and I create that drama?

17:18.289 --> 17:20.082
I spoke to Whip Huxton.

17:20.124 --> 17:23.075
I know about your end run to the board,

17:23.127 --> 17:25.744
and your smudgy fingerprints
are all over this leak.

17:25.797 --> 17:28.257
I'm not an idiot, Jeannie.

17:28.299 --> 17:30.633
Yes, you are.

17:31.886 --> 17:35.431
That's precisely what you are.

17:35.473 --> 17:39.425
I have worked my ass off to
ensure our financial health

17:39.477 --> 17:41.771
and to ensure your
future at this company,

17:41.813 --> 17:44.240
and neither of which would
have happened if I had waited

17:44.282 --> 17:46.015
for the goddamn Cowardly Lion

17:46.067 --> 17:49.145
to mosey on down that yellow brick road.

17:49.187 --> 17:51.480
I mean, I set you up for success,

17:51.522 --> 17:54.150
and you will be lauded
as the bold visionary

17:54.192 --> 17:56.319
who returned Davis/Dexter to its roots.

17:56.361 --> 17:58.588
So for that I'm being shown the door?

17:58.630 --> 18:01.240
Great.

18:01.282 --> 18:03.032
I guess now you won't
have to share the credit.

18:08.089 --> 18:10.039
Well, what do you know?

18:10.091 --> 18:12.041
Maybe you're not an idiot.

18:12.093 --> 18:13.669
So, the evil wizard Archumen has cast

18:13.711 --> 18:16.339
a powerful spell of pestilence
over Celdur's Crossing.

18:16.381 --> 18:17.673
Oh, shit.

18:17.715 --> 18:19.675
My grandma lives in Celdur's Crossing.

18:19.717 --> 18:20.676
It's cool though.

18:20.718 --> 18:22.278
She's a raging bitch.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.347
(LAUGHTER)

18:24.389 --> 18:25.948
(DOUG) This guy, he kills me.

18:25.990 --> 18:27.390
Archumen's also abducted
the fair Princess Galiana,

18:27.442 --> 18:29.518
and secreted her to an unknown lair.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.020
The four of you have been...

18:31.062 --> 18:33.522
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)
It's not a craps table.

18:33.564 --> 18:34.857
Okay?

18:34.899 --> 18:36.325
The four of you have been hired

18:36.367 --> 18:38.694
to track down Archumen
and save the princess.

18:38.736 --> 18:42.198
Aw, yeah, one of us is
gonna get laid tonight.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.407
So, Sabretha's bisexual now?

18:44.459 --> 18:46.168
With the right amount of mead, yeah.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.803
(ALL OOHING)

18:47.845 --> 18:50.006
(MARTY) Well, and it just so happens

18:50.048 --> 18:51.580
that I'm friends with a goblin

18:51.632 --> 18:53.876
who has a liquor store in
a neighboring village,

18:53.918 --> 18:56.012
so I think I can hook that shit up.

18:56.054 --> 18:57.513
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

18:57.555 --> 18:59.015
Why would you be friends with a goblin?

18:59.057 --> 19:01.817
Jesus, Doug, where'd you find this guy?

19:01.859 --> 19:03.426
Shut the fuck up, Nathaniel.

19:03.478 --> 19:06.055
Sorry, dude.

19:06.097 --> 19:08.641
Now, the door leads to
a small, dark room.

19:08.683 --> 19:10.059
You trip over something.

19:10.101 --> 19:12.528
It's a scabbard. There's a sword in it.

19:12.570 --> 19:15.998
I'll do a perception check.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.650
- And...
- The sword's safe.

19:17.692 --> 19:18.668
Sabretha?

19:18.710 --> 19:20.469
I pick up the sword?

19:20.511 --> 19:21.444
Yes! Yes!

19:21.496 --> 19:22.445
That's perfect!

19:22.497 --> 19:24.874
I-I love that move!

19:24.916 --> 19:26.075
- Thank you.
- All right.

19:26.117 --> 19:27.410
(WHISPERS) You see what I did?

19:27.452 --> 19:29.502
(WHISPERS) Everybody saw, okay?

19:32.724 --> 19:34.707
(BURPS)

19:36.227 --> 19:39.088
Okay, so now we find
ourselves in a pleasant,

19:39.130 --> 19:41.590
but under-furnished home,

19:41.632 --> 19:43.342
still suffering the ravages perpetrated

19:43.384 --> 19:45.428
by the wicked she-bitch Sarah.

19:45.470 --> 19:46.762
Easy, easy.

19:46.804 --> 19:48.397
I'm okay. (CLEARS HIS THROAT)

19:48.439 --> 19:50.599
Now, to the north, you'll
find an area to wash up.

19:50.641 --> 19:52.892
And to the east, a cheese
platter from Ralphs,

19:52.944 --> 19:54.937
grudgingly purchased by Nathaniel.

19:54.979 --> 19:56.645
You're welcome, Doug.

19:56.697 --> 19:58.274
Cheapskate.

19:58.316 --> 19:59.608
Uh, all right.

19:59.650 --> 20:01.110
That just means snacks
and a bathroom break?

20:01.152 --> 20:03.085
Yeah, see, now you're getting it.

20:04.489 --> 20:06.782
- Hey!
- Hey.

20:06.824 --> 20:07.990
This is fun, right?

20:08.042 --> 20:09.241
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.386
You play D&D as a kid?

20:10.428 --> 20:11.787
My brothers did.

20:11.829 --> 20:13.162
I was a little too cool.

20:13.214 --> 20:15.124
That's how I always felt about it.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.500
But, you know, Doug
said come check it out.

20:17.552 --> 20:18.961
I thought what the fuck, you know?

20:19.003 --> 20:20.252
Yeah.

20:20.304 --> 20:22.671
So are you trying to get into my pants

20:22.723 --> 20:24.600
or win my business?

20:24.642 --> 20:26.268
Because I don't believe for a second

20:26.310 --> 20:28.070
that you're here to play
Dungeons and Dragons.

20:28.112 --> 20:30.429
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

20:30.481 --> 20:32.308
Look, I got to tell you.

20:32.350 --> 20:34.683
What you've been able
to do at Green Point

20:34.735 --> 20:36.268
is pretty fucking amazing.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.748
So it's business.

20:38.790 --> 20:40.773
It's funny, because my
friends have been urging me

20:40.825 --> 20:43.192
to bring on some big brain consultant.

20:43.244 --> 20:44.904
And look at that, he's standing
right in front of you.

20:44.946 --> 20:46.122
This is kismet.

20:46.164 --> 20:48.090
Yeah, except I'm not really

20:48.132 --> 20:49.992
feeling the whole big brain part.

20:50.034 --> 20:50.683
I mean...

20:50.726 --> 20:52.629
Come on, I made a
couple rookie mistakes.

20:52.670 --> 20:54.096
You jumped into a river

20:54.138 --> 20:55.898
with a full suit of
armor on and drowned.

20:55.940 --> 20:58.040
He sank like a stone. (LAUGHS)

20:58.092 --> 21:00.503
Is what he did. Oh, my God.

21:00.545 --> 21:01.837
How about when he tried to pick a lock

21:01.879 --> 21:03.045
while you were getting your butts kicked

21:03.097 --> 21:04.340
by that band of orcs?

21:04.382 --> 21:05.341
What a fustercluck.

21:05.383 --> 21:06.842
(BOTH LAUGHING)

21:06.884 --> 21:08.761
Oh, man, right?

21:08.803 --> 21:10.012
Yeah, you know what?

21:10.054 --> 21:11.136
Tess and I are having a conversation.

21:11.189 --> 21:12.181
Why don't you, uh...?

21:12.223 --> 21:13.816
Or what, Marty? You'll, uh,

21:13.858 --> 21:15.100
you'll attack me with a crossbow

21:15.142 --> 21:16.786
while possessing a
plus-two in dexterity?

21:16.828 --> 21:18.227
You know what? In my long history

21:18.279 --> 21:20.689
with this game, I-I
can really only think

21:20.731 --> 21:22.458
of one other player
who was that abysmal.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.776
- Really?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

21:23.818 --> 21:26.362
And, uh, I don't want to
mention names, but, uh,

21:26.404 --> 21:28.070
- "Blank" of the D'Urbervilles.
- Uh-oh.

21:28.122 --> 21:31.740
Okay, this was a lot more fun,
when we were railing on Marty.

21:31.792 --> 21:33.536
You're also not yet 30,

21:33.578 --> 21:34.954
and you own a company that's brought in

21:34.996 --> 21:36.705
over $100 million dollars in revenue.

21:36.747 --> 21:40.543
Because as it turns out,
you can suck at a game,

21:40.585 --> 21:42.344
but be killing it in business.

21:42.386 --> 21:45.181
Look, Tess, there are a
lot of good consultants,

21:45.223 --> 21:47.466
but Marty?

21:47.508 --> 21:50.319
Marty's a mad genius.

21:50.361 --> 21:53.022
Look, Green Point's at
a critical juncture.

21:53.064 --> 21:54.557
But with Marty's guidance,

21:54.599 --> 21:56.559
you could end up a billionaire.

21:56.601 --> 21:59.935
Or do you not want to
end up a billionaire?

22:06.277 --> 22:08.527
Don't tell him, don't tell
him what I was gonna say!

22:08.579 --> 22:09.945
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Marty.

22:09.997 --> 22:11.947
Uh, Jeannie's

22:11.999 --> 22:13.659
in the other room feeding the baby.

22:13.701 --> 22:16.035
And we are on our way to
Angeles Crest Highway

22:16.087 --> 22:18.037
to watch the meteor shower.

22:18.089 --> 22:19.121
Really?

22:19.173 --> 22:21.083
At 11:45, huh?

22:21.125 --> 22:22.918
Your dad's strict.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.087
(LAUGHS) Yeah!

22:25.129 --> 22:27.796
And these aren't mine, sir. I'm
holding them for a friend.

22:27.848 --> 22:29.225
Don't worry.

22:29.267 --> 22:31.594
I'll have Jeremiah home
by 2:00, Mr. Kaan.

22:31.636 --> 22:33.369
I know it's a school night.

22:34.722 --> 22:36.388
Well, thank you, young lady.

22:37.642 --> 22:39.101
(ROSCOE) Being vegetarian isn't enough.

22:39.143 --> 22:41.143
I mean, stealing their
eggs and their milk,

22:41.195 --> 22:42.895
it's all part of this
unacceptable system

22:42.947 --> 22:44.940
of the exploitation of animals.

22:44.982 --> 22:46.525
Okay, well, here's the thing.

22:46.567 --> 22:48.233
Phoebe is still only nursing

22:48.286 --> 22:50.613
so currently the only animal

22:50.655 --> 22:52.197
she's exploiting is me.

22:52.239 --> 22:53.449
Here you go, here.

22:53.491 --> 22:55.451
Okay, well, when she's old enough,

22:55.493 --> 22:56.825
I mean, animals are sentient creatures.

22:56.877 --> 22:58.120
They're deserving of life

22:58.162 --> 23:00.256
and freedom.

23:00.298 --> 23:01.790
That's so heavy. You know what?

23:01.832 --> 23:03.666
While you're on your animals soap box,

23:03.718 --> 23:05.628
you may want to consider getting rid

23:05.670 --> 23:07.763
of your lipsticks and
your Vuitton satchel.

23:07.805 --> 23:09.098
You know, I just might do that.

23:09.140 --> 23:10.506
- Uh-huh, I don't believe you.
- Mm-hmm.

23:10.558 --> 23:12.968
How was Dungeons and Dragons?

23:13.010 --> 23:14.803
It was amazing. Thank you for asking.

23:14.845 --> 23:17.139
Not only did we reel in the client,

23:17.181 --> 23:19.241
but we also saved the widdle princess.

23:19.283 --> 23:20.893
Marty Kaan rescuing a princess?

23:20.935 --> 23:22.745
That seems a little out of character.

23:22.787 --> 23:24.280
Wait, was she a stripper?

23:24.322 --> 23:25.688
(CHUCKLES)

23:25.740 --> 23:27.566
Okay, yeah,

23:27.608 --> 23:28.941
go ahead, go get that stuff together.

23:28.993 --> 23:31.737
I'll just toss it down
the chute later, okay?

23:31.779 --> 23:33.278
Come on.

23:33.331 --> 23:35.491
(DOOR CLOSES)

23:35.533 --> 23:38.577
So Klare with a "K," lots of sad poses.

23:38.619 --> 23:41.036
Some of them so sad she could barely

23:41.088 --> 23:42.581
bring herself to put clothes on.

23:42.623 --> 23:43.872
- (FUSSING)
- Yeah, very funny.

23:43.924 --> 23:45.541
Well, I think Klare and I

23:45.593 --> 23:47.710
might be taking a little break.

23:47.762 --> 23:49.421
I did not see that coming.

23:49.463 --> 23:51.173
Oh.

23:51.215 --> 23:54.717
- (PHOEBE LAUGHS)
- Yes, that's your evil, evil mommy.

23:56.604 --> 23:59.348
So I'm sure you've heard
I got fired today.

23:59.390 --> 24:01.016
Apparently,

24:01.058 --> 24:04.119
I create drama.

24:04.161 --> 24:05.688
- Mm.
- Don't worry.

24:05.730 --> 24:07.189
Teddy is still on board
with the strategy,

24:07.231 --> 24:08.457
so don't blow

24:08.499 --> 24:10.359
your consult because of me.

24:10.401 --> 24:12.735
Not that you would, but...

24:12.787 --> 24:15.197
Hey, Jeannie, don't, don't,
don't worry about that stuff.

24:15.239 --> 24:17.239
I don't you need to...

24:17.291 --> 24:19.134
(VOICE BREAKING) Fuck, Marty.

24:19.176 --> 24:22.077
(SIGHS)

24:22.129 --> 24:24.623
I just feel like such a shit magnet.

24:24.665 --> 24:27.249
You know?

24:27.301 --> 24:29.545
I'm probably just
getting what I deserve.

24:29.587 --> 24:32.087
You know, all this karma, it's
just raining down on me now.

24:32.139 --> 24:33.549
Hey, Jeannie.

24:33.591 --> 24:35.184
Karma's bullshit, all right?

24:35.226 --> 24:36.852
Uh...

24:36.894 --> 24:38.988
♪ fuck-karma,

24:39.030 --> 24:41.390
♪ it's-not-your-fault,

24:41.432 --> 24:43.025
♪ Mark-is-a-cunt,

24:43.067 --> 24:45.267
♪ so-is-Teddy.

24:48.489 --> 24:50.866
It's gonna be okay.

24:50.908 --> 24:53.525
Don't worry about it.

24:53.577 --> 24:54.987
Really?

24:55.029 --> 24:56.155
What?

24:56.197 --> 24:57.780
What?

24:57.832 --> 24:59.241
Your penis...

24:59.283 --> 25:01.200
Lovely as it is... Is not gonna

25:01.252 --> 25:02.745
solve this situation right now.

25:02.787 --> 25:04.620
I don't know. I wouldn't
jump to conclusions.

25:04.672 --> 25:06.498
- I mean, it's-it's vegan now.
- Oh, God.

25:06.540 --> 25:08.167
So you're not gonna get fat off of it.

25:08.209 --> 25:09.585
You're playing Dungeons and Dragons.

25:09.627 --> 25:11.376
You got rejected by a girl.

25:11.429 --> 25:13.212
You're, like, some
headgear away from getting

25:13.264 --> 25:14.797
the shit beaten out of you
in a John Hughes movie.

25:14.849 --> 25:16.592
I'm sorry, I got to say

25:16.634 --> 25:18.594
I kind of liked it, playing D&D.

25:18.636 --> 25:20.012
Whatever, dork.

25:20.054 --> 25:22.888
(PHOEBE FUSSING)

25:22.940 --> 25:24.940
Bye, Phoebes.

25:27.445 --> 25:29.605
(MARTY) <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

25:29.647 --> 25:33.442
<i>Davis/Dexter's patent extension
strategy is played out.</i>

25:33.484 --> 25:34.900
There just aren't enough drugs

25:34.952 --> 25:36.779
in the pipeline to keep re-patenting.

25:36.821 --> 25:39.615
And with the R&D improprieties,
the inevitable PR backlash

25:39.657 --> 25:41.867
makes putting a new line of
drugs into the pipeline even

25:41.909 --> 25:44.453
more crucial to Davis/Dexter's
long-term security.

25:44.495 --> 25:46.078
Douglas.

25:46.130 --> 25:47.996
Of course, now we've
identified several prospects

25:48.048 --> 25:49.248
currently in development.

25:49.300 --> 25:51.460
Next-gen antibiotics, immunotherapies,

25:51.502 --> 25:54.253
and some potentially
ground-breaking advances

25:54.305 --> 25:57.339
in the soon-to-be huge market
of food allergy drugs.

25:57.391 --> 25:59.174
By fast-tracking these projects,

25:59.226 --> 26:02.387
Davis/Dexter's future
growth is all but assured.

26:02.429 --> 26:04.596
That is, of course, unless someone

26:04.648 --> 26:06.682
beats them to market.

26:06.734 --> 26:09.351
Someone like you fine
folks here at Novax.

26:09.403 --> 26:11.937
But, uh, you didn't hear that from me.

26:11.989 --> 26:13.939
Hear what?

26:13.991 --> 26:15.858
(LAUGHTER)

26:15.910 --> 26:17.820
This is the beginning of
a beautiful friendship.

26:17.862 --> 26:19.154
Yeah, right.

26:19.196 --> 26:20.696
Thank you very much. Thank you.

26:20.748 --> 26:22.364
- Well done.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

26:24.418 --> 26:26.835
(LOW CHATTER NEARBY)

26:30.040 --> 26:32.124
(CLEARS THROAT)

26:35.095 --> 26:36.839
Say thank you.

26:36.881 --> 26:38.257
Why?

26:38.299 --> 26:39.842
(CHUCKLES)

26:39.884 --> 26:42.384
Because I'm a fucking
mad warlock genius.

26:42.436 --> 26:44.453
Just say thank you.

26:46.223 --> 26:47.589
No.

26:49.727 --> 26:51.954
I heard the pitch to Teddy went well.

26:51.996 --> 26:53.255
Oh, it did, it did.

26:53.297 --> 26:54.723
But not quite as well

26:54.765 --> 26:57.032
as the pitch went to Novax.

26:59.820 --> 27:00.903
Marty.

27:00.955 --> 27:02.865
Gling!

27:02.907 --> 27:05.501
They expressed their gratitude
with a big ol' check.

27:05.543 --> 27:08.544
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

27:11.782 --> 27:13.375
You know what, let's...

27:13.417 --> 27:15.377
let's get the fuck out of Dodge.

27:15.419 --> 27:17.079
I'm here till next Friday.

27:17.121 --> 27:18.380
"Next Fri..."? Jeannie?

27:18.422 --> 27:19.848
Fuck next Friday!

27:19.890 --> 27:21.423
Fuck these guys.
