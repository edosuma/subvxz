Previously
on "Billy the Kid"...

00:04.924 --> 00:07.710
[indistinct chatter]

00:07.840 --> 00:09.233
The powers-that-be have decided
the city's full up

00:09.364 --> 00:10.800
and we have to move on.

00:10.930 --> 00:12.367
There's plenty of jobs
out west.

00:12.497 --> 00:14.412
The land of opportunity.

00:14.543 --> 00:16.501
Just seems wrong
to give everything up.

00:16.632 --> 00:17.850
I don't think we're giving
everything up.

00:17.981 --> 00:20.375
We're just going on a journey.

00:20.505 --> 00:22.768
We barely have $50 each.
It's all I have in the world.

00:22.899 --> 00:26.729
All right, then. Two wagons.
$50 each.

00:26.859 --> 00:28.818
Traveling west is
a dangerous business, Billy.

00:28.948 --> 00:31.299
-[shouts]
-Billy!

00:31.429 --> 00:33.779
[Moss] Things don't always
end up

00:33.910 --> 00:35.868
the way we want 'em to, Billy.

00:35.999 --> 00:37.783
[Kathleen] You know
everything is going to be

00:37.914 --> 00:39.872
just fine, Billy, don't you?
I promise.

00:40.003 --> 00:42.397
-This is it, folks. Coffeyville!
-It's a shithole.

00:42.527 --> 00:43.789
[Kathleen] I need to find a job.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.096
We've just arrived,
and my husband is sick.

00:46.227 --> 00:48.707
[Dr. Appel] I fear the wound,
in your case, is not physical

00:48.838 --> 00:50.535
but in the mind.

00:50.666 --> 00:53.103
[Paddy] When you're older,
take time to look up

00:53.234 --> 00:56.454
at those stars. They reflect
the light that's in you.

00:56.585 --> 00:58.413
[Mary] Take care of your mother,
Billy.

00:58.543 --> 01:02.199
-She's a very special woman.
-Goodbye, Pa.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.635
This is not a toy.

01:03.766 --> 01:06.551
You never point that at a man

01:06.682 --> 01:09.380
unless you intend to use it,
huh?

01:09.511 --> 01:11.078
-I really don't wanna kill you.

[horse blusters]

02:10.049 --> 02:13.444
What's that?

02:13.575 --> 02:16.882
I dunno. Looks like
a dust storm comin'.

02:17.013 --> 02:19.711
Dust storm?
What will that be like?

02:19.842 --> 02:21.757
Well, let me just say,

02:21.887 --> 02:24.977
if it comes,
you'll wish it never came.

02:25.108 --> 02:27.850
Now, Billy, don't be bothering
Mr. Hurley.

02:27.980 --> 02:29.939
He has better things to do.
You come in the back now.

02:30.069 --> 02:33.421
-Sit with Joe. Come on.
-Okay, Ma.

02:44.562 --> 02:46.999
Uh...

02:47.130 --> 02:49.611
I feel real sorry
for your loss, Mrs. McCarty.

02:49.741 --> 02:53.397
Thank you.

02:53.528 --> 02:55.530
And with two young'uns.

02:55.660 --> 02:57.488
Sure gonna be tough.

02:57.619 --> 02:59.577
It's one hell of a tough world
out here.

02:59.708 --> 03:01.623
-We'll survive.
-Nah.

03:01.753 --> 03:04.974
Gonna need a man
to look after you.

03:05.104 --> 03:07.672
I just recently lost my husband,
Mr. Hurley.

03:07.803 --> 03:09.108
I need to take
my family somewhere

03:09.239 --> 03:10.936
that offers
better opportunities,

03:11.067 --> 03:12.895
so right now
I don't need anything

03:13.025 --> 03:14.810
but a good job and a new home
for my boys and me.

03:19.162 --> 03:22.992
Well, seems like the storm's
swinging our way.

03:23.122 --> 03:26.343
We'd better get out
and prepare for it.

03:26.474 --> 03:29.781
[clicks tongue] Hyup!

03:29.912 --> 03:32.828

[Hurley humming]

04:20.832 --> 04:24.053
Would you like a drink,
Miss Kathleen?

04:24.183 --> 04:26.925
-No, thank you.
-Oh.

04:27.056 --> 04:30.407
Well, I thought all you Irish
liked a drink.

04:35.238 --> 04:36.631
I'll wish you a good night,
Mr. Hurley.

04:36.761 --> 04:38.546
Nah, stay.

04:38.676 --> 04:40.722
-Please. Come on, get off!
-Come on! Sit down.

04:40.852 --> 04:45.204
-Get off!
-[Kathleen shouts indistinctly]

04:45.335 --> 04:47.555
-No! Get off me!
-I ain't done with you yet!

04:47.685 --> 04:50.514
-I ain't done yet!
-[Kathleen] No! No!

04:50.645 --> 04:52.516
[Hurley] Stop struggling!

04:52.647 --> 04:55.084
-Get off me!
-Hold still!

04:55.214 --> 04:57.608
-I said, hold still!
-Get away from her!

04:57.739 --> 04:59.697
-[Kathleen breathing heavily]
-Give me that gun!

04:59.828 --> 05:01.438
No.

05:01.569 --> 05:04.920
I said, give me the gun.

05:05.050 --> 05:08.489
No.

05:08.619 --> 05:10.708
You better give me
that gun, boy.

05:10.839 --> 05:12.667
You don't need to hurt nobody!

05:12.797 --> 05:15.974
Come any closer...
I'll shoot you.

05:16.105 --> 05:18.412
-No, Billy.
-It's all right, Ma.

05:18.542 --> 05:20.109
Now, come on, boy.

05:20.239 --> 05:23.025
I wasn't doing anything
to your mother.

05:23.155 --> 05:25.593
Now, no need to mess up
your life

05:25.723 --> 05:28.813
over something
that ain't important.

05:33.644 --> 05:35.516
It's important to me.

05:38.954 --> 05:41.652

Whoa. Whoa.

06:47.979 --> 06:50.939
-Whoa. Whoa.
-[horse nickers]

07:02.733 --> 07:03.734
[Kathleen] Billy?

07:10.175 --> 07:12.569
Thank you, Mr. Hurley.

07:15.050 --> 07:16.138
[indistinct chatter]

07:16.268 --> 07:17.748
[sighs]

07:20.751 --> 07:23.624
Put it down now.

07:23.754 --> 07:25.887
[exhales deeply]

07:26.017 --> 07:28.672
Excuse me.
I'm looking for the manager.

07:28.803 --> 07:30.326
Well, you just found her.

07:30.457 --> 07:33.372
I'm Emily Townshend.
What can I do for you?

07:33.503 --> 07:34.939
I wondered if you had
any vacancies for a cook

07:35.070 --> 07:36.463
or a waitress.

07:38.247 --> 07:39.291
What's your name?

07:39.422 --> 07:41.119
Kathleen McCarty.

07:41.250 --> 07:42.991
These your kids?

07:43.121 --> 07:46.734
Yeah. My name's Billy,
and this is my brother Joe.

07:46.864 --> 07:47.996
Ma'am.

07:51.173 --> 07:52.000
Got a husband?

07:53.915 --> 07:55.743
No. He...

07:57.440 --> 07:59.137
He died back on the Trail.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.273
Sorry to hear that.
Don't take that ring off.

08:04.403 --> 08:06.797
It'll give you some
protection here in town.

08:09.017 --> 08:10.845
Okay.

08:10.975 --> 08:13.543
I'll take you on for a period,
see how things work out.

08:13.674 --> 08:16.938
Give you a guest room for now,
three dollars a day.

08:17.068 --> 08:18.200
Working day's 12 hours.
Food's free.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.506
How's that suit you?

08:21.986 --> 08:23.684
It seems...

08:23.814 --> 08:25.729
very little money
for so many hours.

08:25.860 --> 08:27.992
I thought you said
you wanted a job.

08:28.123 --> 08:30.647
Those are the terms.
Take it or leave it.

08:33.432 --> 08:36.827
Okay. I'll take it.

08:36.958 --> 08:40.657
Okay. Upstairs.
I'll be up in a minute.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.008
Come on.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.713
[indistinct chatter]

08:52.843 --> 08:54.758
[whistles] Hey.

08:54.889 --> 08:57.413
Hey, where are you
off to so fast?

08:57.544 --> 09:01.025
Look, boys, her hands are full.
Maybe we should give her a hand.

09:01.156 --> 09:03.724
Let me pass.

09:03.854 --> 09:05.029
Nothing's stopping you.

09:06.161 --> 09:08.119
[man laughs]

09:08.250 --> 09:09.773
May I offer you a ride?

09:18.086 --> 09:20.044
That's very kind of you.

09:20.175 --> 09:22.743
Any decent gentleman
would do the same, ma'am.

09:22.873 --> 09:24.309
[men howling]

09:24.440 --> 09:25.920
[men hooting]

[man whistles]

09:27.486 --> 09:29.358
[men laughing]

09:29.488 --> 09:32.230
Allow me to introduce myself.

09:32.361 --> 09:34.885
My name's Henry Antrim.
I served with distinction

09:35.016 --> 09:36.670
in the Union Army
during our recent Civil War.

09:38.236 --> 09:40.848
Antrim is an Irish name.

09:40.978 --> 09:43.372
My name is
Mrs. Kathleen McCarty.

09:43.502 --> 09:45.156
I'm from Ireland, too.
County Down, in the north.

09:45.287 --> 09:47.594
Huh. I ain't never been.

09:47.724 --> 09:51.598
But my family's from there.
The north, that is.

09:51.728 --> 09:54.818
One day I'd love to see it.
I hear it's very green.

09:54.949 --> 09:57.429
That's because
it rains all the time.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.388
They say if you can't see
the mountains then it's raining.

09:59.518 --> 10:01.216
And if you can see them,
then it's just about to rain.

10:01.346 --> 10:04.523
[chuckles]

10:04.654 --> 10:06.917
Ah, it's a spring seat.
Better hold on.

10:07.048 --> 10:07.918
[chuckles]

10:13.707 --> 10:15.273
What do you do for work,
Mr. Antrim?

10:15.404 --> 10:16.927
Construction, mainly.

10:17.058 --> 10:21.192
But... [clears throat]
other things, too.

10:21.323 --> 10:24.152
There's plenty of opportunities
out here, Kathleen.

10:26.197 --> 10:29.026
If you don't mind me
calling you that?

10:35.163 --> 10:37.948
[indistinct chatter]

10:38.079 --> 10:39.341
You're late.

10:39.471 --> 10:41.299
Sorry, Ma.
I was putting Joe to bed.

10:41.430 --> 10:42.779
Hey, Carlos.

10:42.910 --> 10:43.911
[speaks Spanish]

10:44.041 --> 10:46.217
What? ¿Qué?

10:48.611 --> 10:50.744
You got to learn to speak
American, my friend.

10:50.874 --> 10:52.267
¿Qué?What?

10:52.397 --> 10:54.312
[laughing]

10:59.448 --> 11:01.972
[giggling]

11:06.977 --> 11:10.938
[footsteps approaching]

11:11.068 --> 11:12.026

11:20.077 --> 11:21.470
Miss.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.994
Miss. Sorry.

11:24.125 --> 11:26.910
Do you want anything else?
We're closing.

11:27.041 --> 11:29.957
Have you finished your work?

11:30.087 --> 11:31.175
Yeah.

11:31.306 --> 11:33.264
Then sit down.

11:33.395 --> 11:35.397
Have some champagne.

11:36.615 --> 11:38.052
I don't--

11:38.182 --> 11:40.184
Shh! Don't say no.

11:53.632 --> 11:55.373
Thank you.

11:58.028 --> 12:00.509
You work so damn hard.

12:00.639 --> 12:01.815
I've watched.

12:01.945 --> 12:03.033
[chuckles]

12:05.209 --> 12:06.950
How much do you earn?

12:10.258 --> 12:12.913
Just got paid. Three dollars.

12:13.043 --> 12:17.482
Three dollars? Jesus Christ.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.441
You want to know
how much I earn?

12:30.669 --> 12:32.889
How?

12:33.020 --> 12:35.413
How do you think?

12:39.200 --> 12:43.073
-My name's Hattie. What's yours?
-Kathleen.

12:43.204 --> 12:44.727
Well, what do you want to do

12:44.858 --> 12:48.165
with the rest of your life,
Kathleen?

12:48.296 --> 12:54.258
I want to run a restaurant
and maybe a boarding house.

12:54.389 --> 12:57.087
You'll need more
than three dollars for that.

12:59.698 --> 13:02.440
You think I should?

13:02.571 --> 13:07.097
What else is there for a young
woman to do here?

13:07.228 --> 13:09.578
She either whores...

13:09.708 --> 13:12.929
or gets married.

13:13.060 --> 13:16.977
[Hattie chuckles]

thieving Mexicans!

13:48.269 --> 13:50.401
What is it?

13:50.532 --> 13:55.450
Don't worry, Joe.
I'll go down and see.

to hell, you thieving bastard.

Here he comes!

[man 3] Hang him!

14:49.504 --> 14:51.288
What you gonna do, Sheriff?

14:51.419 --> 14:54.248
[man 3] Mexican bastards!

14:54.378 --> 14:57.251
Not much I can do now,

'cept let justice
take its course.

[indistinct shouting]

15:24.626 --> 15:28.195
Come on, boys.

15:28.325 --> 15:32.112
My new friend is excited
to meet you both.

15:36.899 --> 15:39.597
[dog barking in distance]

15:43.558 --> 15:45.516
[horse nickers]

15:45.647 --> 15:47.954
-Afternoon, Ma'am.
-Good day.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.393
Billy. Come along.

15:59.704 --> 16:03.099
Well, here we are.

16:06.581 --> 16:08.278
I hope you like him.

16:09.801 --> 16:11.194
[knock on door]

16:16.895 --> 16:18.114
Hello.

16:18.245 --> 16:19.333
Buenos dias, señora.

16:23.772 --> 16:26.601
Welcome.
Welcome to my humble home.

16:26.731 --> 16:28.211
Alístalo.

16:30.779 --> 16:32.389
My dearest Kathleen.

16:36.654 --> 16:39.744
So, these are your boys.

16:39.875 --> 16:43.139
This is Billy, and this is Joe.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.924
Billy and Joe.

16:46.055 --> 16:48.405
Glad to make
your acquaintance.

16:48.536 --> 16:50.320
I have something for you.

16:53.715 --> 16:55.804
[Antrim chuckles]

16:55.934 --> 16:57.588
-Thank you, sir.
-[chuckles]

17:01.853 --> 17:03.594
Billy?

17:03.725 --> 17:05.509
What?

17:05.640 --> 17:08.034
Aren't you going to say
thank you to Mr. Antrim?

17:11.733 --> 17:14.475
[utensils clinking]

17:44.548 --> 17:46.768
I have to tell you, Kathleen,

17:46.898 --> 17:49.597
that it's such a great pleasure
to meet your boys.

17:49.727 --> 17:51.860
You've spoken
so much about them.

17:51.990 --> 17:53.775
You're proud of them,
quite right.

17:53.905 --> 17:56.908
Thank you, Henry.

17:57.039 --> 17:59.389
I confess that things
haven't been easy for the boys,

17:59.520 --> 18:03.393
but through it all,
they've helped and supported me.

18:12.924 --> 18:14.665
What is it, Billy?

18:14.796 --> 18:17.233
Are you...unhappy?

18:19.888 --> 18:23.196
You helped kill
those three Mexicans.

18:23.326 --> 18:24.762
I saw you.

18:24.893 --> 18:26.851
Now, Billy...

18:26.982 --> 18:29.985
No, no, no.
It's all right, Kathleen.

18:30.116 --> 18:32.988
Billy has every reason
to talk about this,

18:33.119 --> 18:35.382
if indeed he was a witness.

18:43.041 --> 18:45.783
You see, Billy...

18:45.914 --> 18:49.004
What you think you saw

18:49.135 --> 18:51.789
isn't actually what happened.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.792
You have to think
about the deeper things.

18:54.923 --> 18:57.795
In this society,

18:57.926 --> 19:02.496
there's a very fine balance
between good and evil.

19:02.626 --> 19:07.718
Thankfully, there are great
forces at work here in the West,

19:07.849 --> 19:10.852
absolutely determined
to bring the rule of law

19:10.982 --> 19:14.508
and a God-fearing justice
to all the people who live here.

19:14.638 --> 19:17.554
But a lot of Mexicans,

19:17.685 --> 19:20.166
they don't see it that way.

19:20.296 --> 19:23.691
They think that
stealin' and shootin' people

19:23.821 --> 19:25.780
is the natural order of things.

19:25.910 --> 19:30.437
But we Americans,
we're trying to change all that.

19:30.567 --> 19:32.526
And one of the ways
we change it

19:32.656 --> 19:35.006
is to punish those
who transgress

19:35.137 --> 19:38.880
the new American laws
and the laws of God.

19:40.925 --> 19:42.840
Hmm.

19:44.886 --> 19:46.322
And who made you the judge?

19:49.543 --> 19:50.805
[Kathleen] Billy.

19:50.935 --> 19:52.937
What is the matter with you?

19:57.507 --> 20:00.380
This isn't like you. What is it?

20:05.907 --> 20:07.517
[door closes]

20:11.260 --> 20:13.741
Seems to me that Mr. Antrim
is a decent,

20:13.871 --> 20:15.830
honest,
religiously minded man.

20:17.832 --> 20:19.921
He's lying to you...

20:20.051 --> 20:22.271
about everything.

20:30.714 --> 20:32.542
Billy, I want you to know,
whatever happens,

20:32.673 --> 20:36.590
Mr. Antrim will never
replace your father.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.114
How could he?

20:39.245 --> 20:43.031
This has nothing to do
with Pa.

20:43.161 --> 20:46.034
It's about that man.

20:49.907 --> 20:52.867
I have to be realistic, Billy.

20:52.997 --> 20:54.869
Mr. Antrim is quite wealthy,

20:54.999 --> 20:57.045
and he can support
and provide for us.

20:57.175 --> 20:58.960
[sighs]

20:59.090 --> 21:01.745
Without him, frankly,
I don't know how we'll manage.

21:08.491 --> 21:11.494
Look at that, huh?

21:11.625 --> 21:13.714
Always thought I'd like to buy
a ranch...

21:13.844 --> 21:16.760
drive cattle.

21:16.891 --> 21:19.720
That's what a man out here
is supposed to want.

21:19.850 --> 21:23.027
You don't want it anymore?

21:23.158 --> 21:25.856
It was a dream that died...

21:25.987 --> 21:28.032
along with other things.

21:29.686 --> 21:31.732
I understand.

21:33.734 --> 21:37.041
My husband, he died.

21:37.172 --> 21:39.609
I don't know...

21:39.740 --> 21:42.046
Felt like he died
of disappointment.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.099
I haven't told you
until now, but...

21:51.229 --> 21:53.536
I lost my wife.

21:53.667 --> 21:54.755
We hadn't been married long.

21:54.885 --> 21:57.975
Typhus.

21:58.106 --> 21:59.542
I'm so sorry.

21:59.673 --> 22:00.935
But at least I know
she's in heaven

22:01.065 --> 22:02.937
with our Lord Jesus.

22:03.067 --> 22:04.721
It's a great comfort.

22:10.031 --> 22:12.773
Do you still have dreams?

22:12.903 --> 22:14.905
I guess so.

22:15.036 --> 22:16.820
-I'm not too old.
-[chuckles]

22:20.171 --> 22:22.652
I have to tell you, Kathleen,

22:22.783 --> 22:24.567
all these weeks we've been
seeing each other

22:24.698 --> 22:27.353
have meant a lot to me.

22:27.483 --> 22:29.006
I thought a man
could get used to being lonely,

22:29.137 --> 22:31.444
but it ain't true.

22:31.574 --> 22:33.010
We're all human.

22:33.141 --> 22:37.580
We need other people.

22:37.711 --> 22:40.191
It's got to be the right person.

22:40.322 --> 22:44.021
Sometimes,
one just gets a feeling.

22:44.152 --> 22:46.502
Comes out of nowhere.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.591
But you know...

22:48.722 --> 22:50.550
it's always the Lord's doing.

22:50.680 --> 22:53.466
[birds chirping]

22:57.121 --> 22:59.210
It's true.

22:59.341 --> 23:02.170
[insects buzzing]

23:05.303 --> 23:07.697
Will you marry me, Kathleen?

23:07.828 --> 23:11.527
Will you make me
the happiest man in Santa Fe?

23:15.923 --> 23:18.708
[dishes clinking]

23:35.812 --> 23:37.074
Billy?

23:39.207 --> 23:42.428
Billy? [speaks Spanish]

23:44.430 --> 23:47.607
My mother just decided to marry
an asshole and a liar.

23:50.827 --> 23:54.657
Do you understand?

[exhales]

-Good evening, young man.

Come on, deal!

-[dealer] You win.

25:25.313 --> 25:27.228

25:27.358 --> 25:29.796
[dealer] Win. Win.

25:32.407 --> 25:33.713
You lose, sir.

25:33.843 --> 25:36.846
No, no, I don't.

25:36.977 --> 25:40.763
I don't lose. I never lose.

25:43.636 --> 25:46.116
Not to this fucking
lousy Mexican!

25:46.247 --> 25:47.117
[gunshot, screaming]

25:47.248 --> 25:50.991
Don't even think about it.

25:51.121 --> 25:53.167
Carlos, no!

25:55.169 --> 25:57.214
Fuck!

25:57.345 --> 25:59.216
You're gonna fucking
pay for this!

25:59.347 --> 26:01.610
Some advice--

26:01.741 --> 26:04.352
don't mess up your own life
for people who don't matter.

26:08.182 --> 26:10.184
He matters to me.

26:20.150 --> 26:22.631
No.

26:28.550 --> 26:31.161
Will somebody fetch
the fucking Sheriff!

26:31.292 --> 26:32.598
[man] Where's the Sheriff?

26:36.036 --> 26:38.081
What are you waiting for?
Deal the fucking cards.

26:38.212 --> 26:39.735
Yes, sir.

26:44.131 --> 26:46.786
[horse whinnying in distance]

26:49.963 --> 26:51.747
He's right this way.

26:53.880 --> 26:57.231
Billy?

26:57.361 --> 26:58.972
Billy, please.
I want to introduce you

26:59.102 --> 27:00.321
to one of our guests.

27:00.451 --> 27:02.976
This is Mr. Ash Upson.

27:03.106 --> 27:04.891
I thought you might be
interested in talking to him.

27:05.021 --> 27:06.632
He's a journalist.

27:06.762 --> 27:08.938
He has information about
what happened last night.

27:09.069 --> 27:11.158
Mind if I sit down?

27:15.945 --> 27:18.426
I'll leave you to it.

27:18.556 --> 27:21.908
Ma'am.

27:22.038 --> 27:23.779
Hello, Billy.

27:32.570 --> 27:34.137
Your mother told me
about your loss.

27:34.268 --> 27:35.965
I'm very sorry.

27:36.096 --> 27:41.318
That kind of thing happens
too often around here.

27:41.449 --> 27:44.931
Yeah.

27:45.061 --> 27:46.715
-Want to talk about it?
-Not really.

27:53.635 --> 27:54.941
I hear the guy
who killed your friend

27:55.071 --> 27:56.072
isn't being charged with murder.

27:56.203 --> 27:58.205
What?

27:58.335 --> 27:59.510
They're saying there were
aggravating circumstances,

27:59.641 --> 28:00.860
that it was self-defense.

28:00.990 --> 28:02.339
That's bullshit!

28:02.470 --> 28:03.993
It was in cold blood.
I was there.

28:04.124 --> 28:07.170
-I saw what happened.
-All right.

28:13.002 --> 28:16.092
Don't.

28:16.223 --> 28:17.311
Please. Sit down.

28:17.441 --> 28:20.357
-It's him.
-I know.

28:20.488 --> 28:23.012
But just don't.
Unless you want to die.

28:23.143 --> 28:25.188
Just don't.

28:25.319 --> 28:28.104
What do you mean?

28:28.235 --> 28:29.976
-Sit down.
-No!

28:30.106 --> 28:33.196
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

28:33.327 --> 28:34.720
Sit down and I'll tell you.

28:36.896 --> 28:38.201
Come on.

28:42.379 --> 28:43.859
Come on.

28:47.254 --> 28:49.909
[indistinct chattering]

28:58.395 --> 29:00.441
I don't know the shooter,

29:00.571 --> 29:02.269
but the gent
he's sitting down with

29:02.399 --> 29:04.924
is a man
by the name of Hennessy.

29:05.054 --> 29:08.449
He's a well-known circuit judge.

29:08.579 --> 29:11.104
He's also a prominent member
of the Santa Fe ring.

29:11.234 --> 29:14.281
What the hell is that?

29:14.411 --> 29:17.545
Well, the rings run most things
out here in the West, Billy.

29:17.675 --> 29:21.854
They are secret societies
of wealthy people.

29:21.984 --> 29:23.638
The Santa Fe ring

29:23.769 --> 29:26.902
is the oldest and most powerful
ring of them all.

29:27.033 --> 29:28.774
Which is why I'm here.

29:31.472 --> 29:34.692
I'm investigating
the whole damn system.

29:34.823 --> 29:38.958
The wholesale corruption,
the cronyism, the lawlessness.

29:39.088 --> 29:41.482
These people, they buy senators,

29:41.612 --> 29:43.353
they buy sheriffs,
they buy judges,

29:43.484 --> 29:46.139
they buy anyone
they damn well please.

29:46.269 --> 29:47.923
And they get rid of people
who stand in their way.

29:53.450 --> 29:57.150
So you think this guy
is a member of the ring?

29:57.280 --> 30:01.067
Either that, or they protect him
for whatever reason.

30:01.197 --> 30:04.592
Well, if people know
about these rings,

30:04.722 --> 30:06.289
why don't they just step in
and break them up?

30:06.420 --> 30:08.422
Because these rings go
all the way to the top.

30:08.552 --> 30:12.208
That's why.

30:12.339 --> 30:14.036
[exhales]

30:16.299 --> 30:18.258
I just want justice
for my friend.

30:18.388 --> 30:22.262
I understand.

30:22.392 --> 30:25.221
But justice...

30:25.352 --> 30:26.657
True justice, Billy,

30:26.788 --> 30:30.705
doesn't usually come out
of the barrel of a gun.

30:30.836 --> 30:36.624
We have to expose the evil
and clean up the system.

30:36.754 --> 30:41.977
And how long will
that take, Mr. Upson?

30:42.108 --> 30:45.067
I don't know.

30:45.198 --> 30:49.680
Years. Possibly longer.

30:49.811 --> 30:51.378
But I know it's the only way.

30:57.950 --> 31:00.126
I don't know if I can
wait that long.

Oh, my God.

33:54.517 --> 33:56.650
What's happened to you?

33:56.780 --> 34:00.393
I don't want to say.

34:00.523 --> 34:02.308
Okay.

Do you want me to put
something on those cuts?

34:12.057 --> 34:14.363
Who did this to you, Hattie?

34:17.497 --> 34:19.673
Don't judge me, Kathleen.

34:19.803 --> 34:21.501
Why?

34:21.631 --> 34:24.025
Why do you say that?
Why would I judge you?

34:24.156 --> 34:26.810
Poor Hattie. I just want
to know who did this to you.

34:26.941 --> 34:28.551
I'm sorry.

34:28.682 --> 34:30.901
What are you sorry for?

34:31.032 --> 34:33.904
This is my fault.

34:34.035 --> 34:36.211
This is not your fault.

34:39.388 --> 34:41.956
Just tell me.

34:42.087 --> 34:44.480
I know you came here
to tell me.

34:48.397 --> 34:49.398
Antrim.

34:54.969 --> 34:58.451
My husband?

34:58.581 --> 35:01.367
He did...he did this?

35:01.497 --> 35:04.805
He was angry.

35:04.935 --> 35:07.764
He said something
had gone wrong.

35:15.772 --> 35:17.426
Hattie...

35:21.343 --> 35:22.823
You and...

35:22.953 --> 35:26.827
Yes.

35:26.957 --> 35:29.482
He's one
of my regular customers.

35:29.612 --> 35:33.964
Even before you came.

35:34.095 --> 35:36.402
And he never stopped.

35:39.883 --> 35:41.363
[sobbing]

35:41.494 --> 35:44.497
I'm so sorry, Kathleen.

35:46.629 --> 35:48.457
I'm so sorry.

35:48.588 --> 35:51.417
[sobbing]

36:14.440 --> 36:15.745
Ma?

36:19.532 --> 36:20.924
Ma.

[knocks]

37:12.280 --> 37:14.761
Good evening, young man.
Can I help you?

37:14.891 --> 37:17.633
Where's Henry Antrim? Tell me.

37:17.764 --> 37:19.722
There's no Mr. Antrim here.

37:19.853 --> 37:22.377
I do apologize.

37:24.684 --> 37:26.990

37:37.610 --> 37:42.397
Why, if it isn't the kid.

37:42.528 --> 37:45.095
What do ya want, Billy?

37:45.226 --> 37:48.534
Wanna lose your cherry? That it?

37:48.664 --> 37:52.712
[chuckling]
About time, I'd say.

37:52.842 --> 37:54.975
Ladies, you may wanna leave.

37:55.105 --> 37:57.891
[tense music plays]

38:02.852 --> 38:04.680
[door closes]

38:08.031 --> 38:10.512
Your ma never sent you
over here, now did she?

38:10.643 --> 38:14.299
[chuckles] 'Course not.

38:14.429 --> 38:18.303
She has every reason
to be grateful to me.

38:22.437 --> 38:26.441
So you just run on home
like a good little boy,

38:26.572 --> 38:28.487
or God help me,

38:28.617 --> 38:30.489
I'll whip your fuckin' Irish--

38:30.619 --> 38:33.056
Yeah, why don't you shoot me?

38:33.187 --> 38:35.842
Mm? How'd you think
Kathleen would feel

38:35.972 --> 38:40.499
seeing you dangling from a rope?

38:40.629 --> 38:42.109
[grunts]

[birds squawking in distance]

39:20.974 --> 39:24.238
-Mom, would you like some?
-No, thank you.

39:24.369 --> 39:28.764
-Gracias, Sofia.
-De nada.

39:51.744 --> 39:54.050
[Antrim sniffs]

[sniffs]

40:03.233 --> 40:04.409
[clears throat]

40:20.033 --> 40:22.078
We have to talk.

40:28.041 --> 40:33.002
The big property deal I was
hoping to clinch fell through.

40:33.133 --> 40:35.701
We're in trouble.

40:35.831 --> 40:40.793
Seems I'm more in debt
than I thought.

40:40.923 --> 40:42.925
But won't the bank...?

40:43.056 --> 40:45.275
The bank won't give me
any more credit.

40:45.406 --> 40:48.061
I took out some loans.

40:48.191 --> 40:51.107
They want to redeem 'em.

40:51.238 --> 40:56.635
[breathing unsteadily]
What are we supposed to do?

41:00.552 --> 41:02.075
We have to get away
from this place.

41:02.205 --> 41:03.598
-And go where?!
-I don't know!

41:11.171 --> 41:12.955
Somewhere I can find a job.

41:17.133 --> 41:22.617
And exactly what kind
of job can you do, Antrim?

41:28.971 --> 41:30.886
[thuds]

41:55.345 --> 41:56.521
You don't have to go with him.

41:59.524 --> 42:03.266
-Yes, I do.
-No, you don't.

42:03.397 --> 42:04.703
You don't have to stay with him.

42:04.833 --> 42:07.183
Yes, I do.

42:08.750 --> 42:10.491
He's my husband.

42:10.622 --> 42:12.841
-And I married him under God.
-[Billy scoffs]

42:12.972 --> 42:15.888
-And I have to stay with him.
-You don't.

42:16.018 --> 42:18.107
I believe in the rites
of the Catholic Church, Billy.

42:18.238 --> 42:21.763
Nothing'll change that.

42:24.331 --> 42:28.770
But...

42:28.901 --> 42:30.293
You don't have
to come with us.

42:34.167 --> 42:36.169
Yeah.

42:36.299 --> 42:38.214
I do.

[indistinct chatter continues]

43:28.874 --> 43:31.746
Hey, Billy.

43:31.877 --> 43:33.269
Hey.

43:37.056 --> 43:40.102
[exhales]

43:40.233 --> 43:43.758
We have to leave here.

43:43.889 --> 43:45.891
Antrim got made bankrupt.

43:46.021 --> 43:48.763
Hmm.

43:48.894 --> 43:51.157
Sorry to hear that.

43:51.287 --> 43:52.941
Where will you go?

43:55.161 --> 43:57.076
Antrim says he needs a job.

43:57.206 --> 44:01.123
Uh-huh.

44:01.254 --> 44:03.909
Well. The fact is,
I'm leaving here, too.

44:04.039 --> 44:06.825
You are?

44:06.955 --> 44:09.349
I am.

44:09.479 --> 44:13.353
My life has been threatened.

44:13.483 --> 44:17.226
There are some times, Billy,
when the threats are empty.

44:17.357 --> 44:19.141
This isn't one of them.

44:22.014 --> 44:25.104
So, you're giving up
on your investigation?

44:29.108 --> 44:31.327
Such threats only make me
more determined

44:31.458 --> 44:34.940
to expose these stinking dogs
for what they are.

44:42.034 --> 44:44.210
Where are you gonna go?

44:44.340 --> 44:48.127
Well, I've been offered a job
in Silver City.

44:48.257 --> 44:51.130
It's a mining town, but it's
getting pretty prosperous.

44:51.260 --> 44:55.003
New businesses of all kinds
are springing up.

44:55.134 --> 44:56.962
Maybe even Antrim can find
himself an occupation.

44:57.092 --> 44:59.312
[scoffs]

44:59.442 --> 45:03.751
Naturally,
because things are flourishing,

45:03.882 --> 45:07.712
the people running the rings
will be moving in, too.

45:18.331 --> 45:21.726
What is it you want to be,
Billy?

45:24.206 --> 45:27.514
You can't work tables
and play poker forever.

45:27.644 --> 45:29.081
Or can you?

45:29.211 --> 45:31.300
No.

45:31.431 --> 45:34.086
No, I'm not doing that forever.

45:34.216 --> 45:37.219
Well, it's possible you might
just find yourself a future

45:37.350 --> 45:39.439
in Silver City.

45:39.569 --> 45:41.746
Railroad is going there.

45:41.876 --> 45:44.009
Apart from the mines,
there are big cattle herds

45:44.139 --> 45:47.664
and open ranges
all over the county.

45:47.795 --> 45:50.363
It's like
America's last frontier.

45:52.234 --> 45:56.456
Out there, you can be
anything you wanna be,

45:56.586 --> 45:58.763
given the courage to try.

46:07.597 --> 46:13.908
I reckon you got a lot
of courage yourself, Mr. Upson.

46:14.039 --> 46:17.651
Hmm.

46:17.782 --> 46:20.567
Well, I don't know, Billy.
Sometimes I think...

46:20.697 --> 46:22.656
courage is just the honesty

46:22.787 --> 46:25.615
to recognize your own weakness.

46:25.746 --> 46:28.140
And then do
something about it.

49:28.668 --> 49:30.278
You little fucker.

49:30.409 --> 49:32.150
The thing is, Billy,

49:32.280 --> 49:33.803
what you don't seem
to understand,

49:33.934 --> 49:35.849
is that I own your mother,

49:35.980 --> 49:39.418
so I own you and your fucking
little brother, too.

49:39.548 --> 49:43.509
Cross me one more time,
and all of you will suffer,

49:43.639 --> 49:47.426
and I mean truly suffer.

49:47.556 --> 49:52.518
Do you understand that?
Do you understand that?

There's a fuckin' snake!

50:33.385 --> 50:35.517
I swear! Dear Jesus,
where the fuck is it?

50:35.648 --> 50:38.520
Where is it? Still here. No, no,
it's here. No, still here.

50:38.651 --> 50:40.131
Where the fuck is it?
Dear Jesus!
