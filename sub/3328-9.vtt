WEBVTT

00:05.570 --> 00:07.993
(thunder rumbling softly)

00:34.360 --> 00:36.362
*

00:52.780 --> 00:54.247
(gunshot)

00:56.750 --> 00:58.684
Sorry, could you
replace those cones?

00:58.720 --> 01:00.688
Could you put
those back, please?

01:00.720 --> 01:02.859
These vehicles are
gomg to destroy the
integrity of the scene.

01:02.890 --> 01:05.256
Who the hell
are you?
We're consulting detectives.

01:05.290 --> 01:06.723
Sherlock Holmes.
I've been asked

01:06.760 --> 01:08.557
to examine this crime
scene, presumably before

01:08.600 --> 01:10.192
all the evidence
has been trampled.

01:10.230 --> 01:11.629
It's okay, just do your job.

01:13.270 --> 01:14.589
"Roosevelt Island Bridge.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.834
Single gunshot victim."

01:15.870 --> 01:17.735
Your cordial invitation,
not 20 minutes ago.

01:17.770 --> 01:19.237
If you're under pressure to
reopen the bridge to traffic...

01:19.280 --> 01:20.269
Whoa, whoa, relax.

01:20.310 --> 01:21.607
We solved this one without you.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.471
Killer's being charged
as we speak.

01:23.510 --> 01:25.671
Bell's interviewing him
down at the station.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.211
Well, I wish you'd told us

01:27.250 --> 01:28.717
about this development;
it saves us a trip.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.115
There aren't
any Witnesses.

01:30.150 --> 01:32.482
I was hoping you two
could take a quick look

01:32.520 --> 01:33.612
and help us
maybe shore up our case.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.287
Well, doesn't sound
like you had a case.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.321
How'd you make an arrest?

01:36.360 --> 01:38.123
Well, before she was killed,

01:38.160 --> 01:40.720
the girl called us and told us
who was about to shoot her.

01:40.760 --> 01:41.749
That helped.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.768
GREGSON:
Her name is Samantha Wabash.

01:48.800 --> 01:52.133
She dialed 911 last night
and told the operator

01:52.180 --> 01:54.603
she was being followed
by a man that she knew well,

01:54.640 --> 01:56.244
a Lucas Bundsch.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.804
He owns a recording studio
in Tribeca

01:57.850 --> 02:00.318
and a .38 caliber
revolver.

02:00.350 --> 02:02.147
She was convinced
that he had

02:02.190 --> 02:04.750
abducted and butchered
her sister

02:04.790 --> 02:05.609
six years ago.

02:05.650 --> 02:07.186
Did he?

02:07.220 --> 02:09.256
He was never _
at the top of our list.

02:09.290 --> 02:10.882
He even passed a polygraph test.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.398
Sometimes, when a murder
doesn't get solved,

02:13.430 --> 02:15.648
the family gets stuck.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.726
They need a vessel
for all their anger.

02:18.770 --> 02:21.193
They tend to fixate
on a suspect.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.605
Well, if he didn't
commit the crime,

02:22.640 --> 02:23.504
then why was he stalking her
with a gun?

02:23.540 --> 02:27.169
One theory: sick of being
falsely accused.

02:27.210 --> 02:30.600
I mean, she had investigators
hounding him for years.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.743
Filing civil suits
that would get bounced back

02:32.780 --> 02:33.815
for lack of evidence.

02:33.850 --> 02:35.579
Made his life
a living hell.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.178
Her 911 call
made it sound like

02:37.220 --> 02:39.609
she thought she had
pushed him too far.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.753
Yes, it's certainly what
she wanted you to believe.

02:41.790 --> 02:42.779
This woman shot herself.

02:43.730 --> 02:44.685
What?

02:44.730 --> 02:46.357
This was a suicide.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.822
A very tidy frame-up.

02:47.860 --> 02:50.761
There was no gun found,
there's no GSR on her hands.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.461
Consider the staging.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.434
On a bridge, next to a railing.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.665
The shooter fired
at remarkably close range.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.302
So, we're to believe, what?

02:58.340 --> 03:00.808
He, uh, he chased her down,
and then he...

03:00.840 --> 03:03.308
got up against
the railing like this?

03:03.350 --> 03:04.374
Well, it's more plausible
than a woman

03:04.410 --> 03:05.809
throwing her gun in the river

03:05.850 --> 03:07.943
after she shoots
herself in the head.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.540
That's what
the wire was for.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.615
These scratches here.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.685
The metal
beneath them is shiny.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.381
They're new.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.819
They're made just last night,
when a weight of some sort

03:18.860 --> 03:20.794
pulled the gun
out of her hand,

03:20.830 --> 03:22.969
over the edge,
after the shot.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.399
I imagine she had a...

03:24.430 --> 03:25.863
rag of some sort
wrapped around her hand

03:25.900 --> 03:27.868
to protect from gunshot residue.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.232
Drag the river beneath this
spot, you'll find the weapon.

03:30.270 --> 03:32.704
(cell phone ringing)

03:32.740 --> 03:34.378
Yeah?

03:34.410 --> 03:35.707
Really?

03:37.550 --> 03:40.018
Holmes and Watson
are coming to you.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.938
Bell says our guy
wants a polygraph.

03:41.980 --> 03:43.880
Innocent people often do.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.808
I'll get some
divers down there.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.715
In the meantime,
until we find something,

03:47.760 --> 03:49.523
I'm going to pursue
the more obvious explanation.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.857
I think we have
a different definition

03:50.890 --> 03:52.858
of the word "obvious."

03:54.000 --> 03:56.821
You look comfortable,
Mr. Bundsch.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.896
I have nothing to hide.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.794
As a rote recitation

04:01.840 --> 04:04.263
of well-established facts,
today's proceedings

04:04.310 --> 04:05.834
will rival the monotony
of an evening

04:05.870 --> 04:07.679
of Trivial Pursuit.

04:07.710 --> 04:08.779
All right, we're good here.

04:08.810 --> 04:10.505
I'm gonna
ask you a few questions

04:10.550 --> 04:12.609
for a baseline, then some
yes or no questions

04:12.650 --> 04:15.619
based on your conversation with
Detective Bell, all right?

04:15.650 --> 04:17.345
_ Your name
IS Lucas Bundsch?

04:17.390 --> 04:18.482
Yes.

04:18.520 --> 04:19.487
Do you plan on

04:19.520 --> 04:20.680
lying here today?

04:20.720 --> 04:22.859
No.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.654
EXAMINER:
Did you murder Samantha Wabash?

04:25.690 --> 04:27.920
No.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.326
EXAMINER:
Do you know where your gun is?

04:30.370 --> 04:31.826
My place was burglarized.

04:31.870 --> 04:33.929
I reported my gun
stolen last week.

04:33.970 --> 04:36.359
And you were at work

04:36.410 --> 04:38.435
between midnight and
2:00 am. last night?

04:38.470 --> 04:40.006
Yeah.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.340
I was mixing a record
until around 4:00 am.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.608
What is it?

04:45.650 --> 04:47.538
(door opens)

04:47.580 --> 04:49.343
Hey. Captain says you
guys can shut it down.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.880
They found the gun
in the river

04:50.920 --> 04:52.410
tied to a dumbbell
and a towel.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.683
What?

04:55.720 --> 04:58.325
Looks like Ms. Wabash
shot herself.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.554
Mr. Bundsch, I want to

04:59.600 --> 05:02.763
thank you for
your cooperation today.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.392
Sorry, just
one more question,

05:05.430 --> 05:06.863
Mr. Bundsch.

05:06.900 --> 05:10.563
Six years ago, did you
kill Allie Wabash?

05:15.640 --> 05:17.073
I've said it a thousand times.

05:17.110 --> 05:18.975
No, I did not kill Allie Wabash.

05:22.080 --> 05:22.910
Very good,
thank you very much.

05:22.950 --> 05:24.440
Hmm.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.758
Good enough.

05:35.860 --> 05:37.964
Hey, what was that
about the sister's case?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.389
I think I made a mistake
on the bridge this morning.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.807
I should have let
Samantha Wabash frame that man.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.808
The hell are you
talking about?

05:45.840 --> 05:49.401
I think Lucas Bundsch
may well be a serial killer.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.863
Lucas Bundsch did not shoot
Samantha Wabash last night.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.458
At the scene,
I would have pegged

06:17.510 --> 06:18.431
the likelihood of
his innocence at 98%.

06:18.470 --> 06:20.438
That figure now stands at 100%,

06:20.480 --> 06:23.677
as it has become clear that she
stole his gun and shot herself.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.541
You were right. We know this.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.912
Yes and no.

06:27.950 --> 06:30.043
I've come to believe that
the recently departed Ms. Wabash

06:30.090 --> 06:32.752
was correct about
the murder...

06:32.790 --> 06:35.179
of the previously
departed Ms. Wabash.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.120
I am 90% certain
that Lucas Bundsch

06:37.160 --> 06:39.185
killed Allie Wabash
snx years ago.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.891
We think he's
a serial killer.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.591
SHERLOCK: Lucas Bundsch
measured his breathing

06:42.630 --> 06:44.188
throughout
the polygraph questioning.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.198
Also, his mandibular action,
at several points,

06:46.230 --> 06:49.802
was consistent with someone
who IS bItIng their tongue.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.865
EXAMINER: Do you plan
on lying here today?

06:51.910 --> 06:53.468
No.

06:53.510 --> 06:54.738
A pain sensation
like that

06:54.780 --> 06:56.805
elevates your heart
rate just a tick.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.943
He bit his tongue during
the control questions

06:58.980 --> 07:01.915
to set the baseline, then
repeated it later twice.

07:01.950 --> 07:04.487
SHERLOCK: Bundsch had no need
for the trick when he was asked

07:04.520 --> 07:06.488
about Samantha Wabash,
but he did it again

07:06.520 --> 07:08.488
when asked about his
whereabouts last night.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.681
That's not damning
in and of itself.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.698
He had nothing to do
with the shooting, so...

07:12.730 --> 07:14.652
the bite might just mean
he values his privacy.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.624
But he did it again when
I asked about Allie Wabash.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.092
GREGSON: There's a reason
polygraph results

07:19.130 --> 07:21.098
are inadmissible in court:
they're Iffy.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.529
But I'm pretty sure
the same could be said

07:23.570 --> 07:25.834
for anyone claiming
to be a human lie detector.

07:25.870 --> 07:28.771
He had deodorant on his hands.
We shook before he left.

07:28.810 --> 07:31.847
Either there was traces
of roll-on antipersplrant

07:31.880 --> 07:33.768
on his fingers, or the man's
skin naturally secretes

07:33.820 --> 07:35.572
a distinctly chemical
sea breeze scent.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.178
BELL:
The examiner has every subject

07:37.220 --> 07:39.586
wash their hands, but unless
you really scrub it off,

07:39.620 --> 07:41.815
the sensors can get fooled;
you don't sweat.

07:41.860 --> 07:44.124
Bundsch was innocent of
the shooting on the bridge.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.752
If he didn't kill Allie,

07:45.790 --> 07:47.894
then why plan ahead
to beat the polygraph?

07:47.930 --> 07:50.524
Let's get Coventry up here.

07:50.570 --> 07:51.969
He's the detective that caught

07:52.000 --> 07:54.833
the Allie Wabash
disappearance in '07.

07:54.870 --> 07:56.804
Got to think
he'll have an opinion.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.865
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

07:58.910 --> 08:00.002
What makes you so sure?

08:00.040 --> 08:02.600
No suspect in
the Allie Wabash case

08:02.650 --> 08:03.799
got more attention
than Lucas Bundsch,

08:03.850 --> 08:05.841
and for no good reason.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.917
We only looked at him to humor
the girl's sister, Samantha.

08:08.950 --> 08:11.510
You just got a taste
of her brand of crazy.

08:11.550 --> 08:13.108
When you lose someone,
Detective, and the killer

08:13.160 --> 08:15.958
is still at large, it's a short
walk to madness; I can attest.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.878
I'd like to think I
wouldn't take my own life

08:17.930 --> 08:19.898
to frame a guy, just 'cause
he gave me the creeps.

08:19.930 --> 08:21.591
That's all this was.

08:21.630 --> 08:23.825
Six years ago, Bundsch
is a part-time mover,

08:23.870 --> 08:25.758
he's working a job
in Allie's building

08:25.800 --> 08:27.165
when Samantha comes for a visit.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.690
She sees him moving a fridge

08:28.740 --> 08:30.867
on a hand truck
near her Sister's place.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.105
She knocks on the door,
doesn't get an answer.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.279
Never sees Allie again.

08:35.310 --> 08:38.939
Naturally, this means
Bundsch killed her.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.072
Well, it's not much,
but it's not nothing.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.712
Read the file;
Allie left Samantha

08:43.190 --> 08:45.841
It was only after that call
she dropped off the map.

08:45.890 --> 08:47.949
Two weeks later, she ended up
in a Dumpster in Midtown.

08:47.990 --> 08:48.979
Grizzly stuff.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.282
So, even after the voice mail,

08:50.330 --> 08:51.854
Samantha fixated on Bundsch.

08:51.890 --> 08:54.927
She even put a private
investigator on him. Nada.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.564
Still, she's in here
pitching theories.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.295
"What if Bundsch
held a gun to Allie's head

08:58.330 --> 09:00.867
when she left a message?"
GREGSON: He didn't.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.800
She was caught
on a traffic cam

09:02.840 --> 09:06.037
near Penn Station leaving
the message, alone.

09:06.070 --> 09:07.731
COVENTRY: The whole time,
Bundsch is Mr. Understanding,

09:07.780 --> 09:09.975
passed a poly--
what more can you ask?

09:10.010 --> 09:11.045
Well, as we told you,

09:11.080 --> 09:13.241
he employed
several counter-measures

09:13.280 --> 09:15.919
whilst hooked up
to the box today, so...

09:15.950 --> 09:17.986
Were you present for
his polygraph in 2007?

09:18.020 --> 09:20.750
Of course I was.
Did you not hear what I said?

09:20.790 --> 09:22.212
Did you not hear what I said?

09:22.260 --> 09:24.979
Six years ago, he must surely
have falsified his polygraph.

09:25.030 --> 09:26.850
I got work to do.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.762
Detective, I intend
to pursue this matter.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.097
Go ahead. I intend
to go get lunch.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.266
Is that all
right with you?

09:35.300 --> 09:36.665
No, not particularly.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.109
I'm trying to clear up
two messes--

09:38.140 --> 09:39.801
one is mine and one is yours.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.273
What I require from you is

09:41.310 --> 09:43.198
the most complete picture
possible of your investigation.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.741
Not just your files
but also your recollections,

09:45.780 --> 09:47.919
however incomplete
and foggy they may be.

09:47.950 --> 09:50.384
What the hell is this
supposed to be, oversight?

09:50.420 --> 09:53.014
Take it easy, Gerry.
You don't think I know
how to do this job?

09:53.060 --> 09:54.118
I think a generous assessment
would be

09:54.160 --> 09:55.809
that you are well aware
of your duties,

09:55.860 --> 09:56.986
but your performance
is a little bit impaired.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.782
Listen to me!
Hey, hey, hey!

09:58.830 --> 10:00.752
Knock it off,
both of you, now.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.961
All right, show's over.
Everyone back to work.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.939
All right, you've got
the detective's case file,

10:08.970 --> 10:10.767
now you two work it alone.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.732
Cut him a
wide berth.
We will.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.202
(door closes)

10:23.990 --> 10:26.015
SHERLOCK: I'd not previously
imagined there existed

10:26.050 --> 10:28.848
the P.I. equivalent
of fast food.

10:28.890 --> 10:30.187
Look at this monstrosity
that Samantha's

10:30.230 --> 10:32.824
_ _ so-called
Investigator constructed.

10:32.860 --> 10:35.294
Yes, curse his attempt

10:35.330 --> 10:36.797
_ to communicate
information clearly

10:36.830 --> 10:38.161
with his audience in mind.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.101
You've been in a mood ever since
we left the station. What is it?

10:43.140 --> 10:45.438
Detective Coventry.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.006
I found his ineptitude
quite vexing myself,

10:47.040 --> 10:47.972
but you really mustn't let...

10:48.010 --> 10:50.274
I think you were
too hard on him.

10:50.310 --> 10:53.017
This is the same
Detective Coventry

10:53.050 --> 10:54.847
who botched the Allie Wabash
investigation.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.212
He missed mandibular action when
he interrogated Lucas Bundsch

10:57.250 --> 10:59.081
six years ago;
I missed it today.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.055
He has 25 years experience
and training; you do not.

11:02.090 --> 11:03.785
Actually, that's a good point:
he's a veteran cop.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.024
Isn't that worth some respect,

11:05.060 --> 11:06.698
especially in a room
full of other cops?

11:10.230 --> 11:12.221
If there's
anything of note

11:12.270 --> 11:13.760
on that footage,
you are increasingly

11:13.800 --> 11:15.392
less likely to observe it.

11:15.440 --> 11:19.137
It's the Uggs;
they're bothering me.

11:19.170 --> 11:21.035
It was 2007,
those glorified slippers

11:21.080 --> 11:22.945
were a veritable pox
on your streets.

11:22.980 --> 11:26.143
Yes, but this was July,
and those things are hot.

11:26.180 --> 11:28.444
Okay, is it me,

11:28.480 --> 11:30.380
or does it look like
she's favoring her left leg,

11:30.420 --> 11:33.150
like she sprained her
ankle or something?

11:37.790 --> 11:39.326
I think her ankle's fine,

11:39.360 --> 11:41.920
save for the fact that there
may be a bomb attached to it.

11:41.960 --> 11:42.927
What?

11:42.970 --> 11:44.426
Samantha's investigator

11:44.470 --> 11:47.030
ransacked Bundsch's trash

11:47.070 --> 11:49.391
the week after
Allie went missing.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.408
The contents were mundane,
but they warranted

11:51.440 --> 11:52.464
a bullet-pointed list,
nevertheless.

11:52.510 --> 11:54.205
Two things stand out.

11:54.240 --> 11:57.107
Broken alarm clock
and a pound of grey fondant.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.141
You think he built
a bomb out of icing?

11:59.180 --> 12:01.148
I think he built something
that looked like a bomb.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.114
Grey fondant,
when properly shaped,

12:03.150 --> 12:05.880
is almost identical _
to several forms of plastique.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.478
Hmm?

12:07.520 --> 12:10.227
You woke up in a madman's lair
with the guts of an alarm clock

12:10.260 --> 12:13.058
wired to that, you'd deliver
any message he told you to.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.920
(knocking)

12:14.960 --> 12:16.188
You expecting anyone?

12:16.230 --> 12:17.788
No.

12:24.140 --> 12:25.937
Sherlock!

12:31.480 --> 12:32.913
Hi.

12:32.950 --> 12:34.770
Lucas.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.947
I didn't catch
your name earlier.

12:38.220 --> 12:40.552
Speak of the devil.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.820
How can we help you,
Mr. Bundsch?

12:42.860 --> 12:44.179
Well, your colleague,
Detective Coventry,

12:44.230 --> 12:46.221
came by my studio
earlier, and...

12:46.260 --> 12:48.455
well, he asked me
about Allie Wabash

12:48.500 --> 12:51.094
and the polygraph
that I had taken.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.098
I guess he was just
doing his due diligence

12:53.140 --> 12:56.064
or whatever, but, uh...

12:56.100 --> 12:58.830
didn't seem like he was
the one with the questions.

12:58.870 --> 13:01.077
And he provided
our address?

13:01.110 --> 13:02.975
Yeah, so I could
clear the air.

13:03.010 --> 13:05.808
We were just discussing
Detective Coventry, weren't we?

13:05.850 --> 13:08.318
How good he is at his job.

13:08.350 --> 13:10.944
Won't you please
come in?

13:19.390 --> 13:21.392
I like your place.

13:21.430 --> 13:23.193
Walls are
a bit thin.

13:23.230 --> 13:26.529
They'd never hold back
our blood-curdling screams,

13:26.570 --> 13:28.538
but we call it home.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.232
Would you like some ice
for your tongue?

13:34.040 --> 13:36.031
We saw you cheat
on the polygraph this morning.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.241
You bit your tongue
during control questions.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.577
You did it again
when you said

13:39.610 --> 13:41.043
you were working
last night.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.116
I was working last night.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.845
Alone, right?

13:44.890 --> 13:47.188
BUNDSCH: I made a bunch
of calls on my cell phone.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.949
Go ahead, check my records.

13:48.990 --> 13:51.026
They'll show you
that I was at my studio.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.379
Since you have
so very graciously

13:52.430 --> 13:54.022
made yourself
available to us,

13:54.060 --> 13:55.254
I would rather discuss
the particulars

13:55.300 --> 13:57.188
of how you abducted
Allie Wabash.

13:57.230 --> 13:59.494
It must have been difficult
to move a refrigerator

13:59.530 --> 14:02.966
with _an_ unconscious woman
in it all by yourself.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.559
How is it that
a consultant for the NYPD

14:06.610 --> 14:08.271
can be so confused over

14:08.310 --> 14:10.107
something as simple
as a timeline?

14:10.150 --> 14:13.415
Allie called her
sister the next day.

14:13.450 --> 14:14.417
There's a tape.

14:14.450 --> 14:16.077
She was alone.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.508
We know about the bomb,
Mr. Bundsch.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.313
The one you strapped
to her ankle.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.521
She didn't know
it was a fake, of course,

14:23.560 --> 14:26.358
which is why she carried out
your instructions.

14:26.390 --> 14:29.359
Yours was not a perfect crime.

14:29.400 --> 14:32.198
You were spotted by your
victim's sister at the scene,

14:32.230 --> 14:34.494
and so you concocted
a fondant-based method

14:34.540 --> 14:36.360
for exculpating yourself.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.209
I'm curious.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.368
Did you come here tonight
hoping to scare us?

14:41.410 --> 14:43.378
Or are you just being
a good predator?

14:45.110 --> 14:46.202
How many others have there been?

14:46.250 --> 14:48.013
BUNDSCH:
I'm sorry.

14:48.050 --> 14:51.019
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:51.050 --> 14:53.484
Then I do believe
we're done here.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.425
BUNDSCH: You know,
Samantha fixated on me

15:03.470 --> 15:05.995
after her sister died.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.430
It ruined her life.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.931
I really hope that you don't
make the same mistake.

15:21.350 --> 15:23.489
HOLMES:
So I took the trouble

15:23.520 --> 15:25.442
of compiling
a list of suspects

15:25.490 --> 15:27.151
in other ongoing
murder investigations.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.259
Perhaps you'd be
good enough to disseminate

15:28.290 --> 15:29.314
our address
to them as well.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.384
Perhaps you'd be
good enough

15:30.430 --> 15:32.227
to kiss my ass.

15:32.260 --> 15:33.352
Did you tell Lucas Bundsch
where they lived or not?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.719
The guy didn't do it, Tom.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.022
There wasn't any harm.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.493
Giving a killer
our address aside,

15:37.530 --> 15:39.395
you have taken our best
investigate option

15:39.430 --> 15:40.658
off the table.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.361
Surveillance is now
Virtually imp055ible.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.038
That's deducing, right?

15:44.070 --> 15:45.162
GREGSON:
Holmes is right.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.165
We could've put eyes on him.

15:46.210 --> 15:47.438
Now his guard is gonna be up.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.107
COVENTRY: How many times
I got to say it?

15:49.140 --> 15:50.971
Bundsch isn't a suspect.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.539
He killed Allie Wabash
and others.

15:54.580 --> 15:55.717
What are you
talking about?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.742
The private investigator
that Samantha Wabash hired

15:59.790 --> 16:01.587
thought that Allie's murder
may have been

16:01.620 --> 16:03.087
the work of a serial killer.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.052
But his efforts
at victimology failed

16:05.090 --> 16:07.251
because they focused on Allie's
physical characteristics.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.019
But the real link between her
and the other victims

16:10.070 --> 16:11.128
was geographic.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.660
Lucas Bundsch
worked as a mover

16:12.700 --> 16:13.769
before he became
a sound engineer.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.631
It's how he
and Annie Wabash

16:15.670 --> 16:16.762
crossed paths
in the first place.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.268
We now know that
between 2008 and 2011,

16:19.310 --> 16:22.029
two other women went
missmg from bUIldings

16:22.080 --> 16:24.674
which he helped clients
move into or out of.

16:24.710 --> 16:26.473
Denise Todd.

16:26.510 --> 16:28.375
Abducted
April 11, 2008.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.739
She was held for
almost two months

16:29.780 --> 16:31.384
before she was killed.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.285
Her body was discovered
in a landfill in June.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.514
HOLMES:
Kathy Spalding.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.188
She went missing
October 9, 2011.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.152
She was presumed dead
when her bloody clothing

16:39.190 --> 16:41.750
was found in a Dumpster
several blocks from her home.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.667
Every mover, plumber
and mailman in this city

16:44.700 --> 16:46.099
has worked in
multiple buildings

16:46.130 --> 16:46.960
where crimes have
been committed.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.163
This seems like
a real connection to me.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.666
Suit yourself.

16:52.710 --> 16:55.031
What's your next move?

16:55.080 --> 16:56.035
Forwards.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.547
Watson and I will...
Split up.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.571
Detective Bell
and I will talk

16:59.610 --> 17:01.146
to Kathy Spalding's family,

17:01.180 --> 17:03.045
see if Bundsch's name
or face is familiar.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.318
You take Denise Todd's.

17:10.360 --> 17:13.488
Even after all this time,
every time the phone rings,

17:13.530 --> 17:17.466
or there's a knock at the door,
I think it's gonna be her.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.560
But now...

17:20.600 --> 17:22.329
if you think
that she was taken

17:22.370 --> 17:25.066
by somebody who killed
two other women...

17:25.110 --> 17:28.807
You sure you've never
seen him before?

17:28.840 --> 17:32.048
You said that he moved
one of our neighbors?

17:36.180 --> 17:39.047
I-I'm sorry, no.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.822
Is there anyone
you can talk to?

17:43.860 --> 17:46.283
A friend,
maybe a grief counselor?

17:46.330 --> 17:48.821
I have joined this
online support group

17:48.860 --> 17:51.328
for, um...

17:51.370 --> 17:53.838
friends and family
of murder victims.

17:53.870 --> 17:55.792
Somehow,

17:55.840 --> 17:57.705
it's less of an admission
that she's gone

17:57.740 --> 17:59.469
to-_to talk about her
in a chat room

17:59.510 --> 18:01.068
instead of an actual room.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.670
These other women
that you think

18:07.720 --> 18:10.143
the guy took,
you said their...

18:10.190 --> 18:11.748
bodies were found?

18:21.160 --> 18:22.457
Hi.
BARTENDER:
Hey.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.728
Club soda, please.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.192
Sure thing.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.437
You were out of line today.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.208
You know you're embarrassing
yourself, don't you?

18:33.240 --> 18:34.776
I'm embarrassing myself?

18:34.810 --> 18:36.630
I'm telling you this
as your friend.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.409
Thanks for
looking out for me.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.418
You got your whole
command, good cops,

18:40.450 --> 18:42.714
listening to this guy
second-guess their work.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.217
It's not good
for morale.

18:44.250 --> 18:47.310
Morale? Let me tell you
what's good for morale.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.555
Holmes closes cases--

18:49.590 --> 18:53.219
more and faster than
anyone I've ever seen.

18:53.260 --> 18:55.592
I got great guys
under my command,

18:55.630 --> 18:57.928
but every one of them
could learn something from him.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.438
I want him
off my case.

19:00.470 --> 19:03.701
You're a good
detective, Gerry.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.298
For a second,

19:05.340 --> 19:07.376
I thought maybe you were
gonna be a great one.

19:07.410 --> 19:09.571
But instead of grinding,

19:09.610 --> 19:12.499
you sit on that stool

19:12.550 --> 19:14.541
and you bitch
and you moan...

19:14.580 --> 19:17.640
You can think this is
personal all you want.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.510
But half the precinct
thinks you got to be

19:19.550 --> 19:21.518
crazier than this_Holmes
guy to put up With him.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.879
I were you,
I'd be careful.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.353
In the meantime,

19:24.390 --> 19:25.857
you don't pull him
off my case,

19:25.890 --> 19:28.222
I'm calling the union.

19:28.260 --> 19:30.797
Maybe you'll take them
more seriously.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.901
Those closest to Denise Todd

19:38.940 --> 19:40.430
have never heard of
Lucas Bundsch.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.708
They have never
seen a man

19:41.740 --> 19:42.968
who looks like
Lucas Bundsch.

19:43.010 --> 19:45.899
I hope your afternoon
was more successful.

19:45.950 --> 19:47.372
Nope.
Everything I had to say

19:47.420 --> 19:49.240
was news to
Kathy Spalding's husband.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.441
There's not much of anything
in these old files, are there?

19:51.490 --> 19:55.415
We know he keeps these women
for extended periods of time.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.849
This would suggest
a lair of some sort.

19:57.890 --> 19:59.551
Ordinarily, I would suggest
we surveil him,

19:59.590 --> 20:01.399
in hopes that he leads us to it.

20:01.430 --> 20:02.954
But Detective Coventry

20:03.000 --> 20:05.594
has made him lowering his guard
nigh on impossible.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.568
You surprised me earlier on,

20:09.600 --> 20:11.238
in the captain's office.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.464
I can't remember the last time

20:12.510 --> 20:14.273
that you suggest
that we work apart.

20:14.310 --> 20:16.278
Did it, perchance,
have anything to do with

20:16.310 --> 20:19.404
the fact that I continue to
lambaste Detective Hip Flask?

20:19.450 --> 20:20.974
Look, I like the guy
as much as you do, okay?

20:21.020 --> 20:22.317
Then why do you seem

20:22.350 --> 20:24.341
to resent me giving him
his comeuppance?

20:27.360 --> 20:28.384
(sighs)

20:28.420 --> 20:29.751
Two weeks ago,

20:29.790 --> 20:32.759
I found this tacked to
a board at the station.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.898
Is that supposed
to be...

20:37.930 --> 20:40.467
Us, relieving ourselves
on a New York City police badge.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.491
This is why
you're upset?

20:42.540 --> 20:43.939
A cartoon?

20:43.970 --> 20:45.562
I'm not naive, okay?
I know how cops can be.

20:45.610 --> 20:47.498
I never_ assumed we were
universally loved.

20:47.540 --> 20:50.270
But you would prefer I ignore
Coventry's ineptitude,

20:50.310 --> 20:51.902
lest more crude
drawmgs appear.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.474
You keep blaming Coventry,
but the truth is,

20:53.520 --> 20:55.340
Bundsch would have never
shown up here the other night

20:55.380 --> 20:56.449
if it weren't for you.

21:00.090 --> 21:01.489
Uh, explain.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.283
You wound
Coventry up.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.355
He deserved it.
Yes, but
you're the one

21:05.390 --> 21:07.358
who's supposed to be able to
see ten steps ahead, right?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.425
So how is it that you didn't
see any of this coming?

21:09.460 --> 21:11.496
How is it possible
you didn't consider

21:11.530 --> 21:14.397
embarrassing a colleague
could blow up in our faces?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.431
I would hardly consider
the man a "colleague."
Well, that's what he is.

21:16.470 --> 21:17.869
Whether you
like it or not.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.764
He wants to put
criminals away just like us.

21:19.810 --> 21:21.437
Just like that cop you scolded
on the bridge yesterday.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.744
Oh, I'm sorry, are you
telling me I need to be nicer?

21:23.780 --> 21:25.372
You can be nice.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.547
I know that you can.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.377
You have this tiny
little zone of courtesy,

21:28.420 --> 21:30.513
but you're only ever willing
to extend it to me.

21:30.550 --> 21:31.778
Listen, I am committed
to this job.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.378
You know that I am.

21:33.420 --> 21:35.456
But to do it well you need,
if not the respect,

21:35.490 --> 21:37.526
then at least the support of
the people that we work with.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.959
So I'm just asking:

21:38.990 --> 21:40.628
what does it cost us
to tread lightly?

21:40.660 --> 21:45.324
I-I've investigated
hundreds of homicides, Watson.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.395
In most cases, the fatal act

21:47.440 --> 21:51.069
is perpetrated in a heated
moment or for calculated gain.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.032
Annie Wabash's death
is a dark outlier.

21:53.070 --> 21:56.699
Her killer was acting
out of monstrous compulsion.

21:56.740 --> 21:59.049
There have likely been others,
there will likely be more

21:59.080 --> 22:02.641
until someone stops
the predator who killed her.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.116
Samantha Wabash gave her life
to do just that,

22:06.150 --> 22:09.358
and then I undid
her sacrifice.

22:09.390 --> 22:11.688
So what does_ it cost us
to tread lightly

22:11.730 --> 22:13.357
around the people
that we work with?

22:13.400 --> 22:15.356
I'll tell you.

22:15.400 --> 22:19.120
Attention and effort,
which I am not willing to spare.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.536
(cell phone ringing)

22:21.570 --> 22:23.401
Hello.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.432
Hi, this is Tim Spalding.
I hope I'm not calling too late.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.630
Not at all.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.409
After you left today,

22:29.440 --> 22:32.568
I was talking with some people
in my online support group.

22:32.610 --> 22:34.669
There's this one lady,
Cynthia Tilden.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.109
She's been a real friend
these last few years.

22:37.150 --> 22:39.687
Anyway, when she heard
the name Lucas Bundsch,

22:39.720 --> 22:42.416
she couldn't believe it.
She knows him.

22:42.460 --> 22:43.927
How?

22:43.960 --> 22:45.587
Cynthia's in the group
because her daughter Bonnie

22:45.630 --> 22:47.723
was killed eight years ago.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.819
The case was never solved.

22:49.860 --> 22:53.432
Bonnie dated Lucas Bundsch
in high school.

22:53.470 --> 22:55.688
Was he a suspect?

22:55.740 --> 22:57.435
No. Cynthia said that he never
crossed her mind

22:57.470 --> 22:58.869
when Bonnie went missing,

22:58.910 --> 23:01.105
but now that the police
think that he might have

23:01.140 --> 23:02.778
committed other murders,
she's got some questions.

23:06.880 --> 23:10.884
TILDEN: I'm confused.
Tim made it sound

23:10.920 --> 23:12.012
like the police were sure
Lucas killed these women.

23:12.050 --> 23:14.814
Well, he's only just reemerged
as a suspect, Mrs. Tilden.

23:14.860 --> 23:17.886
He was dismissed too quickly
in a case six years ago.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.557
He was brought
to our attention yesterday,

23:19.590 --> 23:22.923
and we're becoming more
and more convinced of his guilt.

23:24.930 --> 23:26.659
Mrs. Tilden?

23:26.700 --> 23:28.167
I-I'm sorry.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.862
It's just been
so much to take in.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.504
I've been praying for a break
like this for so long.

23:33.540 --> 23:34.973
WATSON:
Can you tell us a little more

23:35.010 --> 23:36.773
about your daughter's case?

23:36.810 --> 23:40.177
It says here that she was taken
from a school parking lot.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.941
Bonnie was a teacher's aide
at a preschool.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.618
One night, she stayed late
to decorate for Halloween,

23:46.650 --> 23:48.208
but she never came home.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.728
There were signs of a struggle
near her car.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.887
A few weeks later,
they found her.

23:52.930 --> 23:55.626
That fits his pattern
with two of the other women.

23:55.660 --> 23:57.025
When Bonnie was found,

23:57.060 --> 23:59.528
they said she'd been held
for 11 or 12 days.

23:59.570 --> 24:02.061
Now I wonder if he had had her

24:02.100 --> 24:04.830
up at this parents' house
on Oneida Lake.

24:04.870 --> 24:07.009
The Bundsch family
has a second home?

24:07.040 --> 24:10.806
Well, it's just his now;
his parents passed away.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.546
It's the first I'm hearing
of such a residence. You?

24:13.580 --> 24:17.516
You think that's where
he takes his victims?

24:17.550 --> 24:18.949
When did you contact

24:18.990 --> 24:21.117
the Onondaga County
Sheriff's office, Mrs. Tilden?

24:21.160 --> 24:22.252
Dale?

24:22.290 --> 24:23.848
Excuse me?

24:23.890 --> 24:26.927
Our sheriff, Dale Galbraith.
I know him well.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.520
He's been patient with me
all these years.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.619
If you're coming up here,
I could arrange for him

24:31.670 --> 24:34.992
to meet you and take you out
to the lake.

24:39.310 --> 24:41.073
Still hasn't shown up?

24:41.110 --> 24:42.975
They're officially late.

24:43.010 --> 24:45.171
I'm having difficulty
imagining what circumstances

24:45.210 --> 24:47.098
would waylay a mother
who's waited eight years

24:47.150 --> 24:48.811
to see justice
for her daughter.

24:48.850 --> 24:50.784
You have her number, right?

24:55.590 --> 24:58.024
(line ringing)

24:58.060 --> 25:00.699
BUNDSCH: Tilden residence.
Lucas Bundsch speaking.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.049
Are you calling for Cynthia?

25:02.100 --> 25:03.829
Where is she, Lucas?

25:03.870 --> 25:07.124
I'm sorry, she can't come
to the phone right now.

25:07.170 --> 25:10.094
Listen _to me. You're _more_
compromised than you imagine.

25:10.140 --> 25:12.938
I suggest you don't make
your situation any worse.

25:12.970 --> 25:16.007
Please, don't tell me
what to do.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.644
I'd like you come over here.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.671
I'll give you ten minutes.
(line clicks)

25:19.710 --> 25:22.213
Lucas?

25:22.250 --> 25:24.810
How did he know
we we're coming up here?

25:24.850 --> 25:27.080
WOMAN:
911. What's your emergency?

25:27.120 --> 25:29.987
Get me the Onondaga County
Sheriff's office now.

25:35.830 --> 25:37.229
(tires screech)

25:37.260 --> 25:40.297
(indistinct radio transmission)

25:40.330 --> 25:42.696
SHERIFF: You the one
who called us?

25:42.740 --> 25:44.628
Yes. Where's Cynthia?
She's fine, actually.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.137
Says she's been home alone
all morning.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.774
HOLMES: She may not have
been aware of the intruder.

25:47.810 --> 25:48.834
Have you searched
the residence?

25:48.880 --> 25:50.006
We have men in there now,

25:50.040 --> 25:52.008
but there's no sign
of a break-in.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.278
What's the idea here?

25:54.880 --> 25:56.142
Cynthia Tilden,
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.886
We spoke
on the phone last night.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.013
You asked us
to meet with you today.

26:00.050 --> 26:01.711
I don't know either
one of these people.

26:01.760 --> 26:02.988
I've never seen
them before.

26:03.020 --> 26:05.887
Your voice,
it's different.

26:05.930 --> 26:07.227
You're not the person
I spoke to, are you?

26:07.260 --> 26:09.148
Mrs. Tilden, did you have
a daughter named Bonnie?

26:09.200 --> 26:11.589
What? No. I don't
have any kids.

26:11.630 --> 26:14.167
I suppose that's not
your phone number, is it?

26:14.200 --> 26:17.601
No. Look, what's
this all about?

26:18.410 --> 26:20.230
We've been duped.

26:25.950 --> 26:27.941
*

26:51.140 --> 26:53.062
You broke my window?

26:53.110 --> 26:55.738
It wasn't me.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.975
I'll take a polygraph
if you like.

26:58.010 --> 27:00.069
I thought we cleared
everything up the other night.

27:00.110 --> 27:05.639
Do you deny calling me yesterday
and leading me to believe

27:05.690 --> 27:08.215
that you had harmed
an innocent woman?

27:08.260 --> 27:10.854
Of course I deny it.

27:10.890 --> 27:14.826
I underestimated you.

27:14.860 --> 27:18.296
I thought you were
just a serial killer.

27:18.330 --> 27:21.231
Now I know you're a catfish
as well.

27:21.270 --> 27:23.192
Catfish?

27:23.240 --> 27:25.663
Someone who uses_ social media
to create false identities

27:25.710 --> 27:28.929
most typically for the purpose
of pursuing online romance.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.347
_You haven't been
pursumg romance, have you?

27:32.380 --> 27:34.371
You've been creating identities

27:34.420 --> 27:38.117
so you can keep tabs
on your victims' loved ones.

27:38.150 --> 27:41.210
Befriending them in chat rooms
and the like.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.148
It's not enough for you

27:43.190 --> 27:46.159
to slowly torture
someone over time, no.

27:46.190 --> 27:48.420
You want to keep the game going.

27:48.460 --> 27:51.759
You want the ripple effect.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.394
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.935
Cynthia Tilden--

27:58.970 --> 28:00.267
the real one.

28:00.310 --> 28:02.232
You took her name and her image

28:02.280 --> 28:04.407
and you created a tribute page

28:04.450 --> 28:07.305
to a daughter
that she never had.

28:07.350 --> 28:10.274
Complete with falsified
articles about her murder.

28:10.320 --> 28:14.017
You used Cynthia's identity
to infiltrate a chat room

28:14.060 --> 28:15.311
frequented by Tim Spalding.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.987
You know Mr. Spalding.

28:17.020 --> 28:19.284
You abducted his wife
in 2011.

28:19.330 --> 28:21.150
And when he mentioned
Allie Wabash

28:21.200 --> 28:22.121
during an online
support group meeting,

28:22.160 --> 28:24.367
you saw an opportunity
for a little bit of fun.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.061
You fabricated a relationship

28:26.100 --> 28:29.160
between Cynthia's daughter
and his wife.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.202
And then you call me
and my partner,

28:31.240 --> 28:35.199
and you send us to Syracuse
to humiliate ourselves.

28:35.240 --> 28:37.333
I imagine you used some of
the lovely equipment here

28:37.380 --> 28:38.904
to alter you voice.

28:38.950 --> 28:41.214
(over intercom):
Lucas, is everything okay?

28:41.250 --> 28:43.172
Everything's fine, Amy.

28:43.220 --> 28:46.348
Can you click off
the intercom?

28:48.120 --> 28:51.328
You don't want your, uh...
your employees to know

28:51.360 --> 28:54.397
that you've repeatedly abducted,
raped and murdered young women?

28:54.430 --> 28:56.227
That's smart.

28:56.260 --> 28:57.898
You're such
a strange man.

28:57.930 --> 29:02.333
I'm an angry man, Mr. Bundsch,
thanks to you.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.303
I'm curious.

29:07.340 --> 29:09.479
What alter ego did you adopt

29:09.510 --> 29:13.105
to observe Samantha Wabash, hmm?

29:13.150 --> 29:16.415
And-and how did you feel
when her grief

29:16.450 --> 29:19.146
finally drove her
to take her own life?

29:20.490 --> 29:22.481
Was that what
you were hoping for?

29:22.520 --> 29:27.253
I was actually very sorry
to hear about Samantha.

29:27.290 --> 29:28.848
Despite our differences,

29:28.900 --> 29:31.391
I think her death
was tragic.

29:31.430 --> 29:33.967
But maybe it's a
blessing in disguise.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.265
She did have a certain
understanding of

29:37.300 --> 29:39.837
what her sister may
have gone through

29:39.870 --> 29:41.303
in those weeks
before her death.

29:41.340 --> 29:45.208
But what if
the truth was...

29:45.250 --> 29:48.242
was much, much worse?

29:52.450 --> 29:54.259
Lucas!

30:00.930 --> 30:02.852
I sense I should hire
an attorney.

30:02.900 --> 30:04.367
Well, then,
you're wrong again.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.197
Bundsch's lawyer

30:06.230 --> 30:08.437
says his client isn't going
to press charges

30:08.470 --> 30:10.836
at the moment-- could change.

30:10.870 --> 30:13.361
But he's down at court
slapping you and Joan

30:13.410 --> 30:14.502
with a restraining order.

30:14.540 --> 30:16.030
She wasn't even there.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.331
She's your partner.

30:17.380 --> 30:19.268
I suppose he deserves
more credit

30:19.310 --> 30:21.175
for restraint than I do.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.609
Restraining order
is the most effective way

30:23.650 --> 30:25.345
to hobble my investigation.

30:25.390 --> 30:27.517
Much more than a night in jail.

30:27.550 --> 30:33.386
Your investigation, your case,
how this impacts you.

30:33.430 --> 30:35.352
You have any
idea how often

30:35.400 --> 30:37.322
my neck is out for you?

30:37.360 --> 30:40.989
I can offer you
no satisfactory explanation.

30:41.040 --> 30:44.100
It was not a decision,
it was an impulse.

30:44.140 --> 30:46.108
He was gloating.

30:46.140 --> 30:47.903
That is what he does.

30:47.940 --> 30:51.103
He was baiting you,
and you fell for it.

30:51.150 --> 30:54.210
You have sabotaged any hope
of prosecution based on

30:54.250 --> 30:56.946
any of the evidence
you've collected so far.

30:56.980 --> 31:00.108
What you saw at the poly,
your conversations-- out!

31:00.150 --> 31:03.187
Do you think the D.A.'s gonna
put you on the stand now?

31:03.220 --> 31:05.552
What I owe you,
beyond an apology,

31:05.590 --> 31:07.956
is an airtight case
against Lucas Bundsch.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.627
No, no! You are not
getting within a hundred feet

31:09.660 --> 31:11.389
of Lucas Bundsch
or this investigation.

31:11.430 --> 31:13.591
Captain...
You are off
the case.

31:13.630 --> 31:14.938
That's final.

31:27.250 --> 31:28.342
How's your hand?

31:28.380 --> 31:30.018
Wet.

31:34.660 --> 31:37.220
Let's take a look.
(sighs)

31:44.370 --> 31:46.520
You know you broke
your finger, right?

31:46.570 --> 31:48.435
Did I?

31:51.370 --> 31:53.167
I know what you're thinking,
you know.

31:53.210 --> 31:55.576
Amaze me.

31:55.610 --> 31:58.704
I should have known better.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.674
Going to Bundsch's place
of business was a...

32:01.720 --> 32:03.472
miscalculation.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.714
It was a mistake.

32:04.750 --> 32:07.719
I should have been nicer
to the man, no?

32:07.750 --> 32:09.684
I should have extended
my zone of courtesy to him.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.257
Asked him very, very politely
if he would confess

32:12.290 --> 32:14.497
to the brutal rape
and murder of three women.

32:14.530 --> 32:15.724
Actually, I think you showed
great restrain

32:15.760 --> 32:17.159
by not beating him to death.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.989
I endangered the investigation.

32:23.040 --> 32:26.100
And there is _
no more cardinal a Sin.

32:28.310 --> 32:30.232
Well, the restraining order
isn't gonna make things

32:30.280 --> 32:33.101
any easier unless you've figured
a way around that.

32:33.150 --> 32:35.141
(cell phone chimes)

32:41.120 --> 32:45.124
"1428 Humboldt. No rush.
The police are already there."

32:45.160 --> 32:47.082
It's from the same
number Bundsch used

32:47.130 --> 32:49.997
to impersonate Cynthia
Tilden yesterday.

32:50.030 --> 32:51.998
(siren wailing)

32:52.030 --> 32:53.497
(people chattering quietly)

32:55.270 --> 32:56.498
Hey.

32:56.540 --> 32:58.098
What are you guys
doing here?

32:58.140 --> 32:59.732
What happened here?

32:59.770 --> 33:03.206
Girl by the name of
Jenna Lombard got snatched up.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.242
Roommate came home,
found the door kicked in.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.669
Jenna's purse was here,
but she wasn't.

33:07.710 --> 33:10.349
So the roommate called 911.

33:10.380 --> 33:12.416
Who invited you guys here?

33:12.450 --> 33:14.418
Lucas Bundsch.
What?

33:14.460 --> 33:16.087
He's the one
that took the girl.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.327
How you know that?

33:18.360 --> 33:21.193
I'll take a wild guess
and say this is the number

33:21.230 --> 33:22.720
he used to yank
your chain yesterday?

33:22.760 --> 33:24.398
Tech assist said it was
a burner phone, didn't he?

33:24.430 --> 33:25.658
Can't be used
to trace back to him,

33:25.700 --> 33:27.622
if that's what you're asking.

33:27.670 --> 33:30.138
I would propose
that we use it

33:30.170 --> 33:31.637
to triangulate his location,
but it's hard to imagine

33:31.670 --> 33:33.206
that he didn't destroy it
after sending the text.

33:33.240 --> 33:35.231
Look, if Bundsch did this...

33:35.280 --> 33:37.339
Which he obviously did.
If he did, you can't be here.

33:37.380 --> 33:38.642
Neither of you.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.307
I'm sorry, Captain was clear.

33:40.350 --> 33:42.215
You're both off the case.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.241
Now, I'll work the number
he used to contact you.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.643
Hope you were wrong about

33:45.690 --> 33:47.214
him destroying the phone,
but other than that...

33:47.250 --> 33:50.219
It's all right, Detective.
We understand.

33:50.260 --> 33:52.080
If you and the captain decide
that we can be of assistance,

33:52.130 --> 33:53.222
please don't hesitate
to call us.

33:57.600 --> 34:01.536
Hey, you figured out something
with Bundsch, didn't you?

34:01.570 --> 34:03.561
How we're gonna get him.

34:03.600 --> 34:07.138
If you didn't, you wouldn't
have left so quietly.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.229
I took the missing girl's
hairbrush out of her purse.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.578
The hairs entwined in it
will be brimming with her DNA.

34:11.610 --> 34:14.147
I don't understand.

34:14.180 --> 34:17.240
You're right, I have figured out
how we're gonna get Bundsch.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.144
Samantha Wabash had
the right idea.

34:18.190 --> 34:19.487
Circumstances have conspired

34:19.520 --> 34:21.283
to keep me from proving
that Bundsch,

34:21.320 --> 34:23.208
amongst other things,
has abducted Ms. Lombard.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.182
So instead, I'm gonna frame him.

34:33.370 --> 34:35.292
Sherlock, you cannot
keep ignoring me.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.137
No, I-I'm not ignoring you;
I was just trying to avoid

34:37.170 --> 34:39.331
a sotto v_oce discussion
of a criminal conspiracy

34:39.370 --> 34:40.735
in the backseat of a taxi.

34:40.770 --> 34:42.476
W-We are not framing Bundsch.
Nope.

34:42.510 --> 34:44.148
We are not doing anything.

34:44.180 --> 34:46.273
I am undertaking
this task alone.

34:46.310 --> 34:49.143
It was my temper which resulted
in our dismissal from this case.

34:49.180 --> 34:50.511
The restraining order
against us

34:50.550 --> 34:52.689
makes an independent
investigation impossible.

34:52.720 --> 34:53.687
We have no recourse.

34:53.720 --> 34:55.187
I have no choice.

34:55.220 --> 34:57.586
But if you get caught,
you end up in jail--

34:57.620 --> 34:59.258
we both do-- and Bundsch,
he never will.

34:59.290 --> 35:00.518
Your wallet.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.323
Lifted from your purse
on the way home.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.362
Even as you stared daggers
at me from three feet away.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.129
It's a mere reminder
that however skilled

35:06.170 --> 35:08.365
you know me to be at deducing
how crimes are committed,

35:08.400 --> 35:10.732
I am every bit as adept
at committing them myself.

35:10.770 --> 35:12.237
Tomorrow morning,

35:12.270 --> 35:13.828
an anonymous tipster will report

35:13.870 --> 35:16.668
that they saw Bundsch pushing
Jenna Lombard into his vehicle.

35:16.710 --> 35:19.599
Her hair will be found
on his backseat.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.311
And he will go to prison.

35:21.350 --> 35:22.715
Not elegant,
but it doesn't have to be.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.286
It has to be fast.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.787
The clock is ticking
on Jenna's life.

35:25.820 --> 35:27.219
And you honestly think
this plan is gonna save her?

35:27.250 --> 35:28.558
Once Bundsch is in custody,

35:28.590 --> 35:30.182
the prospect of life
without parole

35:30.220 --> 35:31.721
will loom large,
Jenna's location will be

35:31.760 --> 35:33.250
the only chip
he has to bargain with,

35:33.290 --> 35:34.791
and he will break.

35:34.830 --> 35:36.457
But if Bundsch doesn't
talk, Jenna dies.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.899
We don't know
where she is.

35:37.930 --> 35:39.295
And while he's being
booked, processed

35:39.330 --> 35:40.558
and waiting for
a court date,

35:40.600 --> 35:41.862
she's still in some
basement somewhere

35:41.900 --> 35:44.630
with no one to bring her
food or water.

35:44.670 --> 35:46.308
Yeah, you're right.

35:46.340 --> 35:48.433
(sighs)

35:48.480 --> 35:51.301
You know, we-we will
figure something out.

35:51.350 --> 35:52.601
No, you're right,
I mean...

35:52.650 --> 35:55.915
he has to attend to them;
we know this.

35:55.950 --> 35:57.713
He kept Allie Wabash
for two weeks.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.741
He kept Denise Todd alive
for months.

35:59.790 --> 36:01.451
He has to tend to them,
monitor them.

36:01.490 --> 36:03.310
He has to make sure
they haven't escaped.

36:03.360 --> 36:06.249
I think I know
where he keeps them.

36:07.390 --> 36:10.359
Lucas Bundsch.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.391
Captain Gregson, NYPD.

36:12.430 --> 36:14.398
Now, I tried to be
reasonable with you people,

36:14.440 --> 36:15.737
but I guess that
was a mistake.

36:15.770 --> 36:17.328
What is he doing here?

36:17.370 --> 36:19.304
I'm accusing you
of serial murder.
Oh, again?

36:19.340 --> 36:21.706
You know he's not supposed to be
within a hundred feet of me?

36:21.740 --> 36:24.709
Yeah, we worked that out when
the judge issued this warrant.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.638
HOLMES: So, when you bought
this place, it was home

36:26.680 --> 36:27.840
to a failed
Internet startup company.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.711
Over the years,

36:29.750 --> 36:31.809
it's been put to many different
uses, but of course,

36:31.850 --> 36:33.408
the square footage has
always remained the same.

36:33.450 --> 36:35.350
Until it mysteriously shrank.

36:35.390 --> 36:37.278
These are the plans
you submitted to the city

36:37.320 --> 36:39.527
when you applied for a permit
to install this studio.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.596
One would expect
this storage closet

36:41.630 --> 36:43.257
to be about
ten feet deeper.

36:43.300 --> 36:44.597
We're gonna go take a look.

36:44.630 --> 36:46.894
Why don't you, uh, come with us.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.737
Move that stuff
out of the way, please.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.372
HOLMES: When you were asked
about your whereabouts

37:01.420 --> 37:03.445
the night Samantha Wabash
shot herself,

37:03.480 --> 37:05.584
you said you were working here.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.588
I thought I saw you bite your
tongue to fool the polygraph,

37:07.620 --> 37:10.680
but as you predicted when you
visited my home the other night,

37:10.720 --> 37:13.655
your cell phone activity said
you were telling the truth.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.351
Strange.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.322
I was stuck in a binary mode
of thinking.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.588
Is it true? Is it false?

37:18.630 --> 37:21.838
Turns out it was neither,
it was both.

37:21.870 --> 37:23.963
You were here,
you just weren't working.

37:25.840 --> 37:28.536
Lucas, where's the key?

37:30.410 --> 37:33.004
I think we should
get him out of here.

37:33.050 --> 37:34.472
If she is alive,
she shouldn't have

37:34.520 --> 37:36.374
to see his face again,
should she?

37:40.550 --> 37:41.778
Get him out of here.

37:41.820 --> 37:44.527
Let's go. Move.

37:47.390 --> 37:50.325
WOMAN:
Please, I need help.

37:50.360 --> 37:51.622
Jenna?
Help me.

37:51.670 --> 37:54.833
Help, please.

37:54.870 --> 37:56.690
Please, help me.

37:56.740 --> 37:59.459
(sobbing softly)

37:59.510 --> 38:01.569
Please, can you help her?

38:01.610 --> 38:03.009
Her?

38:03.040 --> 38:04.940
She's been in here
longer than me.

38:04.980 --> 38:07.471
He gave us something;
it... it made me sleepy.

38:13.650 --> 38:16.016
(car engine starts)

38:17.590 --> 38:19.387
Process everything
in that room.

38:19.430 --> 38:21.648
But the CSU photographer
shoots the whole place.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.429
before you touch it, huh?

38:23.460 --> 38:25.428
SPALDING:
Excuse me?

38:25.470 --> 38:26.425
Are you Captain Gregson?

38:26.470 --> 38:27.926
Yeah.

38:27.970 --> 38:30.495
I-I'm Tim Spalding.
I'm the husband.

38:30.540 --> 38:31.962
One of your people called me.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.478
Oh.

38:34.510 --> 38:35.977
Tom Gregson. Come with me.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.846
(voice breaking):
Is my wife really okay?

38:40.880 --> 38:42.916
She's in shock.

38:42.950 --> 38:46.841
She's shaking off some sleeping
pills her captor made her take.

38:46.890 --> 38:49.381
But she's here?

38:49.420 --> 38:52.355
She's with the paramedics.

38:52.390 --> 38:54.324
She's been asking for you.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.032
Tim.

39:08.740 --> 39:11.106
(crying)

39:18.050 --> 39:20.541
Everybody?

39:20.590 --> 39:22.854
Listen up.

39:22.890 --> 39:25.927
It has come to my attention that
there's some of you that aren't

39:25.960 --> 39:28.121
thrilled the way some things
are done around here.

39:28.160 --> 39:32.426
Think I've given our consultants
a little too much sway.

39:32.470 --> 39:34.438
Some friends of mine

39:34.470 --> 39:36.893
wanted to let me know
before it was too late

39:36.940 --> 39:38.965
to right the ship.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.534
And I appreciate that.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.436
We've got a mission here.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.072
It's to protect this city

39:45.110 --> 39:48.511
and the citizens
that live in it.

39:48.550 --> 39:51.587
You are all part of that effort
every day.

39:51.620 --> 39:55.158
Most of you do yourselves
and this department proud.

39:55.190 --> 39:58.626
And for that,
I want to thank you.

39:58.660 --> 40:01.151
But if anybody has a problem
with how I utilize

40:01.190 --> 40:03.522
all the tools at my disposal,

40:03.560 --> 40:07.166
be it Holmes and Watson
or the coffee machine...

40:07.200 --> 40:09.031
there's the door.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.506
Back to work.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.511
(footsteps approaching)

40:33.160 --> 40:35.799
I've given further consideration
to your rebuke

40:35.830 --> 40:38.094
regarding my capacity
for niceness.

40:38.130 --> 40:39.859
I didn't mean it
as a rebuke.

40:39.900 --> 40:41.561
I was trying to have
a conversation.

40:41.600 --> 40:42.692
Either way.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.560
You have a point.

40:47.010 --> 40:49.808
There is unquestionably

40:49.840 --> 40:53.776
a certain social utility
to being polite.

40:53.810 --> 40:56.847
To maintaining an awareness
of other people's sensitivities.

40:56.880 --> 41:00.179
To exhibiting all
the traits that might

41:00.220 --> 41:02.017
commonly be grouped
under the heading "nice."

41:02.060 --> 41:03.948
Hmm. I think you'll be surprised

41:03.990 --> 41:06.584
how easy it is to earn
that designation.

41:06.630 --> 41:07.654
No.

41:08.760 --> 41:11.126
I am not a nice man.

41:13.270 --> 41:15.261
It's important that
you understand that.

41:15.300 --> 41:19.760
It's going to save you a great
deal of time and effort.

41:19.810 --> 41:23.735
There is not
a warmer, kinder me

41:23.780 --> 41:26.203
waiting to be coaxed
out into the light.

41:26.250 --> 41:29.139
I am acerbic.

41:29.180 --> 41:31.148
I can be cruel.

41:31.180 --> 41:32.613
It's who I am.

41:32.650 --> 41:35.585
Right to the bottom.

41:35.620 --> 41:39.989
I'm neither proud of this,
nor ashamed of it.

41:40.030 --> 41:42.897
It simply is.

41:42.930 --> 41:47.094
And in my work,
my nature has been an advantage

41:47.130 --> 41:49.598
far more often
than it has been a hindrance.

41:51.100 --> 41:52.829
I'm not gonna change.

41:52.870 --> 41:54.679
You have.

41:54.710 --> 41:57.076
You're not the same person
I met a year and a half ago.

41:57.110 --> 41:58.998
You're...
Good to you? Yeah.

41:59.050 --> 42:01.006
For the most part.

42:01.050 --> 42:03.769
(chuckles softly)

42:03.820 --> 42:07.608
I consider you to be...

42:07.650 --> 42:09.208
exceptional.

42:11.660 --> 42:15.721
So I make an exceptional effort
to accommodate you.

42:15.760 --> 42:18.866
But you must accept that,
for as long as you choose

42:18.900 --> 42:21.698
to be in my life, there will
occasionally be fallout

42:21.740 --> 42:24.732
from my behavior.

42:24.770 --> 42:27.136
That must be a part
of our understanding.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.672
No one can accept
something like that forever.

42:32.710 --> 42:35.110
To thine own self, Watson.
