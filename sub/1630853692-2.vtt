A DIVISION OF TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:36.136 --> 00:38.004
ARE YOU SURE YOU
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

00:38.071 --> 00:39.839
BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL ?

00:39.906 --> 00:42.342
AS YOU RACE AROUND TRYING
TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE,

00:42.409 --> 00:45.311
OR PASS YOUR EXAMS,
OR MAKE LOVE.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.747
ARE YOU CONFIDENT
THAT YOU CAN DISTINGUISH

00:47.814 --> 00:51.084
THE FORCES OF LIGHT
FROM THE FORCES OF EVIL ?

00:51.151 --> 00:53.520
I'M TODD McFARLANE,
CREATOR OF "SPAWN",

00:53.586 --> 00:56.556
AND TO ME THERE'S NOTHING,
NOTHING OUT THERE IN LIFE

00:56.623 --> 00:58.558
THAT IS ALL BLACK
OR ALL WHITE.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.960
GOOD ALWAYS HAS A GERM
OF EVIL INSIDE IT,

01:01.027 --> 01:03.163
AND EVIL,
JUST A TOUCH OF GOOD.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.166
TAKE SPAWN,
AN ASSASSIN IN LIFE,

01:06.232 --> 01:08.568
HELL'S OWN SOLDIER
IN DEATH.

01:08.635 --> 01:10.570
NOT EXACTLY
BOY SCOUT MATERIAL.

01:10.637 --> 01:13.006
BUT IF YOU CONSIDER HE
MADE HIS CHOICES FOR LOVE,

01:13.072 --> 01:16.009
THE LOVE OF HIS COUNTRY,
AND THE LOVE OF HIS WIFE,

01:16.075 --> 01:19.078
WELL, YOU BEGIN TO SEE
HE'S A LITTLE LIKE YOU AND ME.

01:19.145 --> 01:22.348
JUST ANOTHER POOR<i> SCHMOE,</i>
WALKING ON THE RAZOR'S EDGE.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.317
ALL HELL
PUSHING ONE WAY,

01:24.384 --> 01:25.852
AND HEAVEN
PUSHING THE OTHER,

01:25.919 --> 01:27.287
AND HIM STUCK IN
THE MIDDLE,

01:27.353 --> 01:29.355
TRYING NOT TO GET CUT.

01:37.464 --> 01:40.400
WHAT'S HAPPENED,
WHO AM I ?!

01:43.436 --> 01:46.773
MY GOD, HOW DID
THIS HAPPEN TO ME ?!

01:46.840 --> 01:49.242
YOU MADE A DEAL
WITH<i> MALEBOLGIA.</i>

01:49.309 --> 01:53.046
YOU SEE WANDA AND
THEN BECOME HELL'S SPAWN.

01:53.112 --> 01:54.814
SO GET USED TO IT.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.783
YOU SEE VIOLENCE,
YOU ACT !

02:00.453 --> 02:02.021
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ?!

02:02.088 --> 02:04.023
SOMEBODY TOOK THREE
OF MY BEST GUYS

02:04.090 --> 02:05.992
AND THREW THEM INTO
WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN

02:06.059 --> 02:07.060
A WALK-IN
WOOD CHIPPER !

02:07.126 --> 02:08.394
FIND OUT

02:08.461 --> 02:10.330
ABOUT THIS
MYSTERY ASSASSIN.

02:10.396 --> 02:12.499
YOU CAME BACK
FOR HER, SPAWN.

02:12.565 --> 02:14.701
YOU CAME BACK
FOR WANDA.

02:14.767 --> 02:15.835
WANDA...

02:15.902 --> 02:17.904
YOU GOT NOWHERE
TO GO SPAWN.

02:18.938 --> 02:21.841

MY SISTER.

03:20.833 --> 03:23.636
QUIT SHOVING,
I WAS HERE FIRST !

03:23.703 --> 03:26.239
( childrens music )

03:26.306 --> 03:28.141

IT'S THE ICE CREAM GUY.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.543
C'MON LET'S GO,
LET'S GO !

03:35.882 --> 03:37.850
( cheering )

03:38.351 --> 03:40.453
DO YOU HAVE
DRUMSTICKS ?

03:40.520 --> 03:41.621
WHAT ABOUT
CREAMSICLES ?

03:41.688 --> 03:45.358
HELL HAS MANY DEMONS
IN TRAINING.

03:45.425 --> 03:50.196
THIS ONE IS KNOWN
AS BILLY KINCAID.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.054
AHH !

04:17.690 --> 04:20.159
IMAGES OF
LOVE AND HATE

04:20.226 --> 04:23.196
TORTURE THEM
ALL AT FIRST.

04:26.733 --> 04:30.370
IT IS THE WAY OF THINGS
FOR EACH NEW WARRIOR.

04:30.436 --> 04:35.475
THERE IS NO RESPITE,
FROM THE INNER PAIN.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.942
MY GOD, NOT
ANOTHER ONE.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.377
ANOTHER ONE ?

05:11.444 --> 05:13.046
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN ?

05:13.112 --> 05:14.814
KIDS GET
DUMPED HERE.

05:14.881 --> 05:17.116
NEVER HAD A CHANCE,
HORRIBLE, ISN'T IT ?

05:18.451 --> 05:20.453
SHE HAS A
LITTLE GIRL NOW.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.654
WHO ?

05:21.721 --> 05:23.322
SHE WANTED CHILDREN.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.091
SHE WON'T ADOPT.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.126
BUT IT WAS
ME ALL ALONG.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.195
YOU KNOW,

05:29.262 --> 05:33.099
NOT WANTING TO PRY
OR NOTHING,

05:33.166 --> 05:35.568
BUT SOME OF US WERE
KIND OF CURIOUS, YOU KNOW,

05:35.635 --> 05:39.439
WONDERING JUST WHAT
THE HELL ARE YOU ?

05:39.505 --> 05:42.542
SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T
WANT TO BE BOTHERED.

05:42.608 --> 05:43.976
THAT'S WHAT
I TOLD THEM.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.011
I SAID WHEN
HE WANTS TO TALK

05:45.078 --> 05:47.613
HE'LL TALK,
RIGHT ?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.248
DON'T HOLD
YOUR BREATH.

05:49.315 --> 05:50.416
LOOK MISTER,

05:50.483 --> 05:51.918
I FIGURE YOU'RE HANGING
AROUND THE ALLEYS

05:51.984 --> 05:53.419
FOR A REASON.

05:53.486 --> 05:56.255
MAYBE YOU JUST
WANT SOME COMPANY ?

05:56.322 --> 05:58.691
I'VE GOT NOWHERE ELSE
TO GO THAT'S ALL.

05:58.758 --> 06:01.260
COULD BE YOU
NEED A FRIEND.

06:01.327 --> 06:05.364
ALL I NEED IS WANDA
BUT I CAN'T HAVE HER.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.533
NOT LIKE THIS.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.768
WHY NOT ?

06:08.835 --> 06:11.037
YOU ASK
STUPID QUESTIONS !

06:12.605 --> 06:14.574
I'VE SEEN
LOTS WORSE.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.908
I USED TO WORK
FOR A MORTICIAN.

06:15.975 --> 06:17.977
<i>THAT</i> MAKES ME
FEEL BETTER.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.679
GET OUT OF HERE.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.716
YOU KNOW FOLKS
AROUND HERE

06:23.783 --> 06:25.852
DON'T LOOK OR
SMELL SO NICE BUT,

06:25.918 --> 06:27.620
WE'RE GOOD PEOPLE.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.622
WE SHARE
WHAT WE GOT.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.457
YOU'RE WELCOME TO IT.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.061
WITH EACH NEW
HELL SPAWN,

06:35.128 --> 06:38.965
THERE'S ALWAYS
THE QUESTION HOW LONG,

06:39.031 --> 06:40.099
IF AT ALL,

06:40.166 --> 06:42.902
CAN THEY HANG ON
TO THEIR HUMANITY ?

06:45.605 --> 06:48.241
SOME LAST
LONGER THAN OTHERS.

06:48.307 --> 06:49.842
HE KILLS A
BUNCH OF GUYS,

06:49.909 --> 06:51.144
LEAVES FOR
A WHILE,

06:51.210 --> 06:53.713
COMES BACK AND CAMPS
DOWN HERE IN RAT CITY.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.249
HE LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
OUT OF GODAMN<i> STEPHEN KING</i>

06:56.315 --> 06:57.784
FOR CHRIST SAKE !

06:57.850 --> 07:01.220

07:11.330 --> 07:12.698
HE'S GOT PROBLEMS.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.034
YEAH, DID YOU SEE

07:27.380 --> 07:29.882

WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS,

07:33.019 --> 07:35.688
WE DON'T NEED TO BORROW
ANYMORE MORE PROBLEMS !

07:35.755 --> 07:37.490
LIFE'S SHITTY
ENOUGH AS IT IS.

07:37.557 --> 07:38.791

IT'S THE TRUTH.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.827
GET HIS ASS THE HELL

07:44.363 --> 07:46.165
HE'S SITTING
DOWN THERE BY HIMSELF

07:46.232 --> 07:47.733
IN THE HEART
OF RAT CITY.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.502
WHERE'S HE SUPPOSED
TO GO FROM THERE ?

07:49.569 --> 07:51.070
POTTERS FIELD ?

07:51.137 --> 07:54.040

08:04.417 --> 08:05.418
DON'T COME

08:05.484 --> 08:08.588
MAYBE WE CAN SCRAPE TOGETHER

13:12.625 --> 13:15.094
WHAT THE HELL IS
THIS ALL ABOUT ?

13:15.161 --> 13:15.961
IT'S ABOUT US,
SENATOR.

13:16.028 --> 13:17.096
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

13:17.163 --> 13:18.631
I HEAR YOU'RE GOING
TO TAKE A PASS

13:18.697 --> 13:20.566
ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.834
HOW DO YOU
KNOW THAT ?

13:21.901 --> 13:24.036
I BARELY TOLD
MY WIFE.

13:24.103 --> 13:26.372
I WANT TO PUT YOU IN
THE WHITE HOUSE, SENATOR.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.174
YEAH RIGHT.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.443
AND EXACTLY HOW MANY SKELETONS
DO I HAVE IN MY CLOSET ?

13:31.510 --> 13:33.579
PER OUR
ARRANGEMENT,

13:33.646 --> 13:36.482
I'VE BEEN HOLDING THE KEY TO
THAT CLOSET FOR SOME TIME.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.617
GOUGING THE EYES
OUT OF ANYONE

13:38.684 --> 13:40.853
WHO SO MUCH AS LOOKS
IN IT'S DIRECTION.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.288
YOU'RE SERIOUS ?

13:42.354 --> 13:43.656
ALWAYS.

13:45.958 --> 13:49.361
ALRIGHT,
SAY I RUN,

13:49.428 --> 13:50.196
WHAT DO YOU GET
OUT OF IT ?

13:50.262 --> 13:53.866
A FRIEND IN A
VERY HIGH PLACE.

13:53.933 --> 13:57.803
TO BE HONEST, I NEVER
WANTED THE OVAL OFFICE.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.606
I'M CONTENT FIGHTING BATTLES
FROM THE SENATE FLOOR.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.275
MAYBE A SPEAKER
OF THE HOUSE.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.678
SORRY, NOT
GOOD ENOUGH.

14:05.744 --> 14:08.547
IN OTHER WORDS
YOU'RE NOT ASKING ME.

14:10.282 --> 14:11.717
AND IF I REFUSE ?

14:11.784 --> 14:14.753
I SEE A CLOSET
DOOR SWINGING OPEN.

14:14.820 --> 14:18.557
YOUR OWN PERSONAL
PANDORA'S BOX.

14:18.624 --> 14:20.259
YOU COULD DO THAT.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.794
BUT THEN I'LL HAVE
TO CALL THE PRESIDENT.

14:21.860 --> 14:25.064
LET HIM KNOW ABOUT A CERTAIN
INTERNATIONAL TEA PARTY

14:25.130 --> 14:26.599
YOU'RE THROWING
WITH D.O.D. ORDINATES.

14:26.665 --> 14:29.568
THE SCANDAL WOULD MAKE
WATERGATE AND IRAN CONTRA

14:29.635 --> 14:32.972
SEEM LIKE A MILD FART
ON CAPITAL HILL.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.573
LOOK McMILLAN,

14:34.640 --> 14:36.742
YOU GET SOMETHING
STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW.

14:36.809 --> 14:39.311
THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT YOU AND ME.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.514
LAST TIME I CHECKED
YOU HAD FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

14:42.581 --> 14:45.084
I CAN MAKE
THEM SUFFER TOO.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.652
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

14:46.719 --> 14:48.621
WHO'S GOING TO PROTECT
YOUR LITTLE BASTARD SON BILLY

14:48.687 --> 14:50.356
FROM NEW YORK'S FINEST ?

14:53.259 --> 14:56.328
I HEAR THE CONS ON RIKERS
DESPISE CHILD KILLERS.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.931
RAPED ONE LAST YEAR
WITH A BAND SAW.

14:58.998 --> 15:01.800
WE'RE IN BED
TOGETHER SENATOR,

15:01.867 --> 15:04.036
WE HAVE BEEN
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

15:04.103 --> 15:09.475
SO RELAX, BEND OVER,
AND ENJOY IT.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.913
( sirens )

15:34.867 --> 15:36.902
WHAT THE HELL IS IT
ABOUT THIS ALLEY, TWITCH ?

15:36.969 --> 15:38.871
THE ATMOSPHERE.

15:38.937 --> 15:39.872
WHAT DO WE KNOW ?

15:39.938 --> 15:42.274
MORE OF
TONY TWIST'S CREW.

15:42.341 --> 15:44.076
RIGHT, TROUBLESHOOTERS.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.979
GUYS SENT IN
TO SETTLE SCORES.

15:47.046 --> 15:48.614
PRECISELY, SIR.

15:48.681 --> 15:51.216
LOOKS LIKE THEY GOT
SETTLED INSTEAD.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.619
NO REPORTERS
THIS TIME ?

15:53.686 --> 15:56.422
PERHAPS HE WAS
<i>ALLOWED</i> TO LEAVE.

15:56.488 --> 15:59.158
SENDING A MESSAGE
TO BIG TONY.

15:59.224 --> 16:00.626
TWIST DOESN'T LIKE GETTING
SPANKED THIS HARD.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.095
IF WE AIN'T CAREFUL THERE'S
GONNA BE A WAR DOWN HERE

16:03.162 --> 16:04.263
UNLESS WE CAN
FIGURE OUT

16:04.330 --> 16:05.531
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON !

16:05.597 --> 16:06.832
WHAT ABOUT
THOSE REPORTERS ?

16:06.899 --> 16:08.367
NOTHING YET, SIR.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.969
RUMOR HAS IT THEY WERE
TRACKING SOMEONE HIGH UP.

16:11.036 --> 16:14.106
A MAJOR SCANDAL,
BUT THAT'S ALL SO FAR.

16:14.173 --> 16:17.443
BUT THERE IS ONE
UNUSUAL ELEMENT.

16:17.509 --> 16:18.577
WHAT ?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.746
THE DEAD HOMELESS MAN FROM
THE PREVIOUS KILLINGS.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.281
THE MUSHROOM.

16:22.348 --> 16:24.316
HIS NAME'S
JEFF STEVENS.

16:24.383 --> 16:27.686
FORMER TECHNICAL HEAD
OF SPETCOM CELLULAR.

16:27.753 --> 16:28.554
SO WHY'D HE TURN OUT

16:28.620 --> 16:30.189
DRIVING DUMPSTERS
ON OUR BEAT ?

16:30.255 --> 16:31.690
SEEMS HE WAS
LISTENING IN

16:31.757 --> 16:34.259
ON SOME VERY HIGH
LEVEL CONVERSATIONS.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.228
I GOTTA FIGURE STEVENS
HEARD SOMETHING HUGE,

16:36.295 --> 16:38.330
HOPED TO TRADE OFF
HIS INDICTMENT

16:38.397 --> 16:39.431
FOR WHAT HE WAS
SITTING ON,

16:39.498 --> 16:41.133
AND USE THE NEWSBOYS
AS MIDDLEMEN.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.801
ASTUTE AS
ALWAYS SIR.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.238
NOW BREAKFAST.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.407
I HAVE A MAP OF
THE LOCAL COLOR, SIR.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.075
YOU PREFER
GREASE OR SUGAR ?

16:50.142 --> 16:53.011
BOTH, I'M
FEELIN' TENSE.

17:00.319 --> 17:02.888
BURKE, THAT
FAT BASTARD.

17:02.955 --> 17:06.291
YEAH, HE'S GONNA GIVE
A SHIT ABOUT THIS CASE.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.193
( phone )

17:08.260 --> 17:09.995
YEAH ?

17:10.062 --> 17:12.131
WHEN DOES HE LAND ?

17:12.197 --> 17:14.633
GOOD, PICK HIM UP
THE SECOND HE TOUCHES DOWN

17:14.700 --> 17:16.835
AND BRING HIM
INTO MY OFFICE.

17:16.902 --> 17:18.604
YOU WANT JUSTICE
DONE RIGHT

17:18.670 --> 17:20.906
YOU GOTTA BUY IT
YOURSELF.

17:35.487 --> 17:37.790
( Tony )
YEAH, I'LL BE HONEST.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.825
I FIGURED YOU FOR A RUMOR.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.395
EX-CIA KILLER TURNED
RUTHLESS MERCENARY.

17:43.462 --> 17:46.532
A LITTLE MORE THAN
A SKELETON ON A RESPIRATOR

17:46.598 --> 17:48.033
FOR ALMOST
THREE YEARS,

17:48.100 --> 17:49.835
I MEAN PLEASE.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.870
THE PAIN WAS
CLEANSING.

17:51.937 --> 17:53.906
HOW'D YOU COME BACK
FROM THAT ?

17:53.972 --> 17:56.208
THE RUMORS YOU'VE
HEARD ABOUT ME,

17:56.275 --> 17:58.243
ARE ALL TRUE.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.012
HEARD YOU GOT
NO CONSCIENCE.

18:00.078 --> 18:03.248
NO SOUL WHEN IT
COMES TO KILLING.

18:03.315 --> 18:06.285
WHAT I'VE GOT IS
A HUNGRY BANK ACCOUNT.

18:06.351 --> 18:07.886
AND RIGHT NOW,

18:07.953 --> 18:10.789
SOMEONE'S PAYING ME TOP
DOLLAR ON YOUR BEHALF.

18:10.856 --> 18:13.225
SO, WHAT SEEMS
TO BE THE PROBLEM ?

18:13.292 --> 18:16.028
YOU KEEP UP WITH
CURRENT EVENTS ?

18:16.094 --> 18:18.197
ONLY WHERE DEATH
IS CONCERNED.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.934
YOUR MEN HAVE
HAD A BAD WEEK.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.870
YEAH, I WANT THE PIECE
OF SHIT RESPONSIBLE.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.039
BRING ME HIS BONES
IN ONE BAG

18:27.105 --> 18:29.141
AND HIS ORGANS
IN ANOTHER, OKAY ?

18:29.208 --> 18:30.576
OF COURSE.

18:30.642 --> 18:33.212
BUT I'LL BE KEEPING
THE HEART FOR MYSELF.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.446
FOR WHAT ?

18:34.513 --> 18:36.849
DINNER.

18:44.923 --> 18:47.092
( clown )
SUCH SWEET FOLKS,
THOSE HOMELESS.

18:47.159 --> 18:50.062
THEY WILL TAKE
ANYBODY IN.

18:50.128 --> 18:52.498
INCLUDING A FREAK
LIKE YOU, SPAWN.

18:52.564 --> 18:55.400
HEY, MAYBE YOU'LL MEET
A NICE HOMELESS WOMAN

18:55.467 --> 18:58.070
AND RAISE A BUNCH
OF HOMELESS KIDS.

18:58.136 --> 19:01.540
WOULDN'T THAT
JUST BE KEEN ?

19:01.607 --> 19:03.141
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT ?

19:03.208 --> 19:05.410
RIGHT TO THE POINT,
I LIKE THAT, I REALLY DO.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.980
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WHAT
THE HELL DO I WANT,

19:08.046 --> 19:12.117
IT'S WHAT DOES HELL
WANT TO DO WITH YOU.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.052
CARE TO KNOW
WHAT THAT IS ?

19:14.119 --> 19:15.354
NO ?

19:15.420 --> 19:19.558
OKAY, HERE IT IS--
IT IS TIME TO GET REAL.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.293
GOT IT ?

19:21.360 --> 19:23.662
HEY, A DEAL'S A DEAL,
AND MALEBOLGIA,

19:23.729 --> 19:26.365
MY BOSS AND YOURS,
DELIVERED ON HIS END.

19:26.431 --> 19:29.034
YOU GOT TO
SEE YOUR WIFE.

19:29.101 --> 19:32.905
DEAR SWEET
TASTY WANDA.

19:32.971 --> 19:36.441
I GOT TO SAY SPAWNY,
BABY'S GOT BACK.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.510
YOU'RE ABOUT
TWO SECONDS FROM

19:38.577 --> 19:40.479
WEARING THAT SMILE
AROUND YOUR ASS.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.281
YEAH, YEAH,
KISS ME FIRST, ALRIGHT ?

19:42.347 --> 19:45.684
ANYWAY, IT'S BUSINESS
NOW BIG BOY.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.786
YOU GOT THE UNIFORM
AND THE ATTITUDE,

19:47.853 --> 19:49.621
SO LET'S GET TO IT.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.989
TO WHAT ?

19:51.056 --> 19:53.425
YOU'RE A HELL SPAWN.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.860
THE EARTH IS
READY TO BURN.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.328
YOU'RE THE GUY
WITH THE MATCH,

19:56.395 --> 19:59.765
AND I'M HERE TO MAKE
SURE YOU DO THE JOB RIGHT.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.600
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THIS,

20:01.667 --> 20:03.402
I GOT MY OWN
PROBLEMS.

20:03.468 --> 20:06.872
YOU DON'T JUST TURN YOUR BACK
ON YOUR OBLIGATIONS.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.508
WHAT, YOU THINK
YOU'RE TOO GOOD

20:09.575 --> 20:11.276
TO BE A HELL SPAWN ?

20:11.343 --> 20:14.746
YOU SHOULD BE DOWN ON YOUR
KNEES THANKING MALEBOLGIA

20:14.813 --> 20:17.716
FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF
BEING A RANKING OFFICER

20:17.783 --> 20:20.485
IN THIS HELL'S ARMY.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.187
YOU SHOULD BE
DOWN ON YOUR KNEES

20:22.254 --> 20:25.857
THANKING ME FOR NOT
KILLING YOU WHERE YOU STAND.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.125
YEAH RIGHT.

20:27.192 --> 20:29.094
I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.797
BUT IT'S TIME
YOU FOUND OUT.

20:31.863 --> 20:35.167
LISTEN FAT BOY, I'VE
HAD JUST ABOUT ENOUGH...

20:38.337 --> 20:39.404
WHOO !

20:39.471 --> 20:41.340
YEAH, BABY.

20:41.406 --> 20:45.544
RIGHT THERE, THAT'S
HOW DADDY LIKES IT !

21:01.259 --> 21:04.062
YOU'LL FEEL
SOME PAIN...

21:04.129 --> 21:07.199
BUT I KNOW
YOU CAN HEAR ME.

21:07.265 --> 21:08.667
GET OUT OF
MY HEAD !

21:08.734 --> 21:12.237
NO, IT'S HOW US
CHILDREN OF HELL,

21:12.304 --> 21:13.905
COMMUNICATE,

21:13.972 --> 21:16.742
THROUGH TELEPATHY.

21:27.719 --> 21:29.588
( gunshots )

21:41.233 --> 21:44.936
SO BEGINS
YOUR TRAINING.

21:45.003 --> 21:46.705
WHAT ARE YOU ?

21:46.772 --> 21:49.875
A CREATURE
<i> FAR</i> SUPERIOR

21:49.941 --> 21:52.310
TO HUMANS.

21:52.377 --> 21:57.215
A TRUE NATIVE OF HELL.

21:57.282 --> 22:00.218
SOMETHING NO SPAWN
WILL EVER BE.

22:00.285 --> 22:03.355
FOOL, YOU CAN'T
RELY ON WEAPONS.

22:03.422 --> 22:07.059
THAT'S NOT WHY
HE CHOSE YOU.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.094
THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOU

22:09.161 --> 22:13.231
THAT MALEBOLGIA SENSES,
SOMETHING EVIL.

22:13.298 --> 22:15.801
THERE ARE RULES
TO FOLLOW.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.503
IT'S MY TASK
TO MAKE SURE YOU DO.

22:22.107 --> 22:25.110
CONSIDER THIS
A FRIENDLY REMINDER.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.245
GET WITH THE
FUCKING PROGRAM.

22:30.082 --> 22:33.118
YOU SPAWN, HAVE
NEVER BEEN WORTHY.

22:35.487 --> 22:38.323
I'LL BE BACK FOR YOU BABY,
AND WHEN I COME,

22:38.390 --> 22:41.026
YOU BETTER BE READY
TO ROCK AND ROLL.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.328
THIS IS THE FAREWELL
BASH FOR HUMANITY.

22:43.395 --> 22:46.465
AND YOU, YOU'RE BRINGING
THE PARTY FAVORS.

22:46.531 --> 22:49.401
OH, AND A WORD
TO THE WISE,

22:49.468 --> 22:51.203
LAYING THERE ALL
TWISTED UP LIKE THAT,

22:51.269 --> 22:53.305
IT'S NO GOOD
FOR YOUR BACK.

23:07.085 --> 23:09.221
THAT WAS PATHETIC.

23:09.287 --> 23:12.257
BUT NOT ALTOGETHER
UNEXPECTED.

23:12.324 --> 23:16.161
YOUR POWERS ARE FINITE,
USE THEM SPARINGLY.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.662
WHAT AM I
INTO HERE ?

23:17.729 --> 23:19.831
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

23:19.898 --> 23:21.433
I THINK IT'S INSANE.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.568
AM I DEAD OR AM
I ALIVE, WHAT AM I ?

23:23.635 --> 23:26.104
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TRUST YOURSELF

23:26.171 --> 23:27.139
FOR THE ANSWERS.

23:27.205 --> 23:28.940
IF YOU KNOW WHAT IS
GOING ON OLD MAN,

23:29.007 --> 23:32.644
I'D SUGGEST YOU
TELL ME STRAIGHT.

23:32.711 --> 23:37.048
THERE'S A WAR ON
BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL.

23:37.115 --> 23:39.518
AND YOU ARE ON
THE FRONT LINES.

23:39.584 --> 23:40.886
WHAT WAR ?

23:40.952 --> 23:42.521
THE ONLY WAR.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.790
EARTH IS
THE BATTLEFIELD,

23:44.856 --> 23:47.959
HUMAN SOULS,
THE PRIZE.

23:48.026 --> 23:50.962
JUST THE WAY
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.

23:51.029 --> 23:53.031
YOU'RE NUTS,
YOU KNOW THAT ?

23:53.098 --> 23:54.800
LOOK--

23:54.866 --> 23:58.203
YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION
TO THE WORLD YOU'RE IN.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.039
YOU MIGHT THINK
YOU'RE DOING GOOD

24:01.106 --> 24:03.241
TAKING OUT
THE BAD ELEMENT.

24:03.308 --> 24:05.710
BUT YOU JUST CAN'T
GO AROUND KILLING

24:05.777 --> 24:08.013
WITHOUT A
LITTLE FORETHOUGHT.

24:08.079 --> 24:12.617
THERE ARE REPERCUSSIONS
YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE.

24:12.684 --> 24:15.220
STOP TAP DANCING AROUND
THE ISSUE AND SPIT IT OUT.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.956
I WISH IT WERE
THAT EASY.

24:18.023 --> 24:20.091
ALL I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS,

24:20.158 --> 24:23.228
YOU'VE STILL
GOT A CHOICE.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.963
WHAT KIND OF CHOICE ?

24:25.030 --> 24:29.367
IF<i> I</i> TOLD YOU,
IT WOULDN'T MATTER.

24:29.434 --> 24:32.304
JUST FIND OUT.

24:32.370 --> 24:34.639
THEN MAKE
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

24:34.706 --> 24:36.775
BUT DON'T WAIT
TOO LONG,

24:36.842 --> 24:39.077
