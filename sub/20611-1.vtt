WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.404
[rock music]

00:03.437 --> 00:05.406
- Here in the Forge,

00:05.439 --> 00:07.308
America's best bladesmiths
have gone head to head...

00:07.341 --> 00:09.577
- [yells]
- [laughs]

00:09.610 --> 00:12.080
- Creating some of history's
deadliest weapons.

00:12.113 --> 00:15.783
And now,
we're turning up the heat,

00:15.816 --> 00:18.419
because tonight,
in a "Forged in Fire" first,

00:18.452 --> 00:20.554
all four judges
will take a seat at the table.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.423
And for the first time,

00:22.456 --> 00:24.392
each has selected a smith
to represent them

00:24.425 --> 00:27.161
in the ultimate battle
for supremacy.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.329
- Starting to get
a little nervous here.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.131
- It's smith versus smith

00:30.164 --> 00:32.266
and judge versus judge

00:32.300 --> 00:34.135
with everyone's reputation
on the line.

00:34.168 --> 00:39.307
*

00:41.575 --> 00:45.213
*

00:45.246 --> 00:47.181
- My name is Josh Smith,

00:47.215 --> 00:48.749
and the fact that
Jason picked me, it means a lot,

00:48.782 --> 00:50.484
'cause he's
a fellow Mastersmith.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.420
He expects the same level
from his knives

00:52.453 --> 00:55.256
as he expects to see
from my knives.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.857
- My name's Mareko Maumasi.

00:56.890 --> 01:00.428
I'm excited that
I get to be Doug's champion.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.463
I wanna do
everything right by him.

01:02.496 --> 01:06.534
I wanna make a sexy knife
and just make him proud.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.203
- My name is Erin Simmons.

01:09.237 --> 01:13.407
The biggest reward is that
Dave Baker invited me back,

01:13.441 --> 01:17.578
so I feel like
I've already won in some ways.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.180
- I'm David Goldberg.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.182
After I won "Forged in Fire,"

01:21.215 --> 01:24.618
I was in a motorcycle accident
and nearly died.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.121
The judge who selected me
was J. Neilson,

01:27.155 --> 01:28.822
and I respect his work and him,

01:28.856 --> 01:32.526
so it was very nice to hear
that he chose me.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.329
- Gentlemen,
welcome to the Forge.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.765
Each of one of these judges
has chosen one of you

01:37.798 --> 01:40.434
to be his champion
in this competition.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.569
Let's find out why.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.371
*

01:43.404 --> 01:45.273
- Josh, I chose you,

01:45.306 --> 01:47.441
because you made the best blade
that didn't win,

01:47.475 --> 01:48.842
and that's why
I don't think there's anyone

01:48.876 --> 01:50.844
more deserving of
a second chance.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.246
- Thank you.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.415
- Erin, you're my choice.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.883
Ever since I was a kid,

01:55.916 --> 01:58.319
I have always loved to watch
farriers work.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.888
I still remember
your incredible hammer work,

02:00.921 --> 02:02.923
and I know you're hungry
to prove yourself,

02:02.956 --> 02:05.193
and that's why I asked you back.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.695
- David, you're our only
returning champion.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.397
You've given us clean work.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.265
You got one hell of
a comeback story too,

02:11.299 --> 02:12.733
which is very inspiring.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.803
- Mareko, I chose you,
because you presented us

02:15.836 --> 02:17.771
with a gladius that was one
of the most impressive blades

02:17.805 --> 02:20.274
in the history of
this competition,

02:20.308 --> 02:23.377
and I think with those skills,
you can win this whole thing.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.213
[dramatic music]

02:25.246 --> 02:27.548
- Well, I hope you guys all feel
warm and fuzzy now.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.884
It's quite a compliment to
be singled out by these judges.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.221
But that's about to end.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.756
This competition can only have
one "Forged in Fire" champion

02:35.789 --> 02:38.559
who walks away with $10,000.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.862
On your anvils in front of you
is a bar of high-carbon steel

02:41.895 --> 02:43.931
from which you will forge
a signature blade.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.533
However,
as you may have guessed,

02:45.566 --> 02:47.668
there's a twist.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.904
You will also have to
forge your blades using these.

02:50.938 --> 02:54.408
*

02:54.442 --> 02:56.444
These are all
random pieces of steel

02:56.477 --> 02:58.646
from the urban environment.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.815
We've got fire hydrants,
fire escape ladders,

03:01.849 --> 03:06.320
subway grates, road signs,
pieces of railroad.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.889
Each item can only be selected
by one contestant,

03:08.922 --> 03:10.658
so choose wisely.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.526
And in order to
keep things fair,

03:12.560 --> 03:16.497
you will all be given equal
amounts of the steel you choose.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.566
Names were drawn from a hat.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.868
Mareko, choose your item.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.404
- I'm gonna go with the sign.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.406
- David, go ahead and choose.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.940
- I choose the grate.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.343
- Josh, you're up.
Choose your item.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.979
- None of it's anything
I would ever use for a knife,

03:32.012 --> 03:33.914
so I'm feeling pretty nervous.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.916
I choose the stairs.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.985
- And Erin,
what would you like to use?

03:38.018 --> 03:40.388
- I choose the railroad track.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.656
I'm last to pick,

03:42.690 --> 03:44.792
and they left out
the best steel.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.560
The railroad track has

03:46.594 --> 03:48.929
a little more carbon in it
than mild steel.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.665
I think it'll make
a tougher blade.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.967
- The blade parameters
are as follows.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.836
The length of the blade,
not including the tang,

03:55.869 --> 03:58.639
must fall between
12 and 14 inches.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.274
The overall length
of your weapon

04:00.308 --> 04:02.910
must not exceed 22 inches.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.845
Keep in mind that
in the second round,

04:04.878 --> 04:06.447
you'll be putting handles
on your blades,

04:06.480 --> 04:08.416
turning them into
fully functional weapons.

04:08.449 --> 04:11.719
They will then be tested
in an apple slice

04:11.752 --> 04:13.921
and an antler chop.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.390
You impressed
the last time you were here.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.825
Impress them again.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.294
Their reputation depends on it.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.862
Your three-hour
forge time starts...

04:21.895 --> 04:23.464
*

04:23.497 --> 04:24.465
Now.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.367
*

04:26.400 --> 04:28.636
- Sometimes, they say
you can take chicken poop

04:28.669 --> 04:30.438
and make it into chicken salad,

04:30.471 --> 04:32.039
and that's kind of the way
I see this challenge.

04:32.072 --> 04:35.042
But at least they have
a really good piece of steel

04:35.075 --> 04:37.345
to blend these other pieces
of steel with.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.579
- They just have to
blend the two

04:38.612 --> 04:40.080
and make it a functional piece.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.849
- Feeling a little anxious.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.385
This challenge
is gonna be tough.

04:44.418 --> 04:47.321
I decided I'm gonna make
a long slender blade

04:47.355 --> 04:51.725
that I really liken to
a bush knife.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.094
What I'm gonna do is first
take the high-carbon steel

04:54.127 --> 04:56.063
and make it into a bar,

04:56.096 --> 04:58.699
and then take two layers
on either side of the grate

04:58.732 --> 05:00.734
and laminate it together.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.504
- He's gonna have to be careful
blending those layers,

05:03.537 --> 05:05.673
so he's got the high-carbon
steel on the edge.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.942
- This knife is the first knife
that I've made since I crashed.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.579
I'm excited, I'm back.
Let's do this.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.981
[rock music]

05:14.014 --> 05:16.850
- I'm going to make
a big bowie hunting knife,

05:16.884 --> 05:19.887
because the blade
is just the right thickness.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.689
A blade that's too thin

05:21.722 --> 05:24.057
is most likely to break
on the antler

05:24.091 --> 05:25.593
that they're gonna test it with.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.461
*

05:27.495 --> 05:30.598
Nothing about
the railroad track is useful...

05:30.631 --> 05:33.033
[chuckles]
In the state that it exists.

05:33.066 --> 05:37.471
It has to be completely
re-profiled, reshaped.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.907
I'm sure that is
part of the challenge.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.443
Nothing is left easy.

05:42.476 --> 05:45.045
*

05:45.078 --> 05:46.914
- I'm gonna make
a chef's knife.

05:46.947 --> 05:50.117
Kitchen knives typically have
a very thin edge,

05:50.150 --> 05:53.053
so my plan was just
to forge the knife in a way

05:53.086 --> 05:55.088
so it had a more robust edge,

05:55.122 --> 05:58.692
which can withstand the impact
of hitting a hard antler.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.694
I'm gonna forge
my high-carbon bar

06:00.728 --> 06:02.463
down into flat stock,

06:02.496 --> 06:04.532
cut it up into
a bunch of pieces,

06:04.565 --> 06:08.168
and then I'm gonna mix that in
with the street sign material,

06:08.201 --> 06:10.638
but only have the street sign
material on the outer edges.

06:10.671 --> 06:14.608
*

06:14.642 --> 06:16.644
- I'd like to make a fighter.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.146
I don't generally make 'em
12 inches long, though.

06:19.179 --> 06:22.182
It starts to limit my design
capabilities at that length.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.851
- I wonder what's up his sleeve.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.486
- His last name is Smith, man.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.954
I mean, he knows
what he's doing.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.689
- My game plan
with that stair material

06:28.722 --> 06:30.824
is to draw it out
and thin it out,

06:30.858 --> 06:32.660
and get on the outside
of my billet.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.595
If that billet's a sandwich,

06:34.628 --> 06:36.163
it's got everything
in the fridge, the pantry,

06:36.196 --> 06:37.197
and something
from the garage in it.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.032
[chuckles]

06:39.066 --> 06:41.635
- You have two hours remaining
to finish your work!

06:41.669 --> 06:43.437
*

06:43.471 --> 06:46.139
I am very impressed
with David right now.

06:46.173 --> 06:49.477
He's already forge welded
his stack.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.179
You can see how much
he's drawn it out already.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.883
- I have to grate together
with the high-carbon steel.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.486
I'm feeling really good.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.988
As long as I remember
to stay focused, to stay calm,

07:01.021 --> 07:02.723
I'll do well.

07:02.756 --> 07:06.494
And I'll use
some of my foundational

07:06.527 --> 07:09.797
martial art exercises
to keep me centered.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.600
Some Kihon Waza, it's called--

07:12.633 --> 07:16.036
some basic exercises
to balance me

07:16.069 --> 07:18.038
and to strengthen me
during the competition.

07:18.071 --> 07:21.174
*

07:21.208 --> 07:24.011
- Man, I'm concerned about
Mareko time.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.613
- He must have
a lot of confidence

07:25.646 --> 07:28.115
in his ability
to get those welds to stick

07:28.148 --> 07:30.117
and draw them out.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.119
- I know the clock's ticking
over my shoulder,

07:32.152 --> 07:35.656
but when I forged
the round stock out to flat bar,

07:35.689 --> 07:37.825
there's a bunch of
forge scale on it.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.192
Before you put that
all back together,

07:39.226 --> 07:41.094
you gotta grind all that,

07:41.128 --> 07:43.597
otherwise you won't have
good clean weld bonds.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.733
- I'd like him to start
getting the stack together

07:45.766 --> 07:47.668
and start setting the welds.

07:47.701 --> 07:51.872
*

07:51.905 --> 07:55.042
- Looks like Erin just chopped
his billet in half.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.777
Do you think
that was intentional?

07:56.810 --> 07:57.978
- Yeah...
- Well, I hope so.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.847
- But I don't know why.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.116
- If I use the entire length
of that tool steel,

08:03.150 --> 08:06.720
I'll be greater than
the parameters they asked for,

08:06.754 --> 08:09.222
and then
I'm immediately ejected,

08:09.256 --> 08:11.625
so I cut some material off.

08:11.659 --> 08:15.996
*

08:16.029 --> 08:18.031
- Josh is going to town
with the hammer,

08:18.065 --> 08:20.634
so he's obviously
pretty happy with that steel.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.036
- I think that he's ahead
of the curve right now.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.738
- I knew he would be.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.306
- Once I see that bar's
drawing out,

08:26.339 --> 08:28.108
and I don't see
any major cracks,

08:28.141 --> 08:30.644
I'm starting to feel
some cautious optimism.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.646
But it's really hard
to get too excited

08:32.680 --> 08:34.648
when you know that
there's a potential disaster

08:34.682 --> 08:35.783
waiting around the corner.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.051
God, I wish I wasn't so fat.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.020
Sweating like a bastard.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.555
- You have just
60 minutes remaining

08:41.589 --> 08:42.723
to finish your blades!

08:42.756 --> 08:44.958
*

08:44.992 --> 08:46.694
- Now we're [bleep].

08:46.727 --> 08:48.261
- It looks like
Dave's dealing with

08:48.295 --> 08:51.799
a little bit of a warp or a bend
to one direction or another.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.901
- It's important
to straighten the blade

08:53.934 --> 08:55.936
before you harden it.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.606
If it's curved
when you harden it,

08:58.639 --> 09:00.007
it will curve more.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.809
- David, what are you doing?

09:01.842 --> 09:03.310
- Dave...

09:03.343 --> 09:05.212
- Ah, he's gonna break it.
[laughter]

09:05.245 --> 09:07.314
- If I bend it too much,
it could crack.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.949
*

09:08.982 --> 09:11.619
If that happens,
I'm finished.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.286
*

09:13.320 --> 09:17.991
[bleep].

09:18.025 --> 09:21.261
So I decide I'm gonna
take the blade to the grinder,

09:21.294 --> 09:23.096
and hopefully
it'll work itself out.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.367
[rock music]

09:27.400 --> 09:30.738
- Why does Erin have
a hole in his blade?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.973
- I'm gonna tell you
exactly what Jason's gonna say.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.307
It's to lighten the blade

09:34.341 --> 09:36.143
and help the air
flow through it,

09:36.176 --> 09:37.344
so it moves faster in the cut.
- [laughs]

09:37.377 --> 09:39.212
- No, no, no,

09:39.246 --> 09:41.348
it's to hang it on a nail
when you're not using it.

09:41.381 --> 09:45.786
- The hole is to expand
the handle a little bit,

09:45.819 --> 09:47.788
so you have a place
for the hand to feel secure.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.723
*

09:49.757 --> 09:52.660
- You have just 30 minutes
remaining to finish your work!

09:52.693 --> 09:54.327
*

09:54.361 --> 09:57.330
- Looks like Mareko's
preparation is paying off.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.132
- He's taking that blade,

09:59.166 --> 10:01.669
and suddenly it's a knife.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.337
- I got the blade
forged out really fast.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.340
I'm feeling pretty good
about the profile.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.842
Now I can quench the blade.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.211
*

10:11.244 --> 10:13.647
- Mareko's in.

10:13.681 --> 10:15.749
- The first thing I wanna do
is check it with a file,

10:15.783 --> 10:17.350
because I know that's
something they're gonna do.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.687
*

10:19.720 --> 10:20.854
[bleep] [bleep].

10:20.888 --> 10:22.289
*

10:22.322 --> 10:24.725
It's soft.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.661
I can't submit
a soft blade to the judges.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.997
I have to heat-treat it
a second time,

10:30.030 --> 10:34.101
but I'm a little worried about
running out of time.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.269
- There we go.
David is in the quench.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.071
*

10:38.105 --> 10:40.874
And Josh just quenched.
- Yeah.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.677
*

10:43.711 --> 10:46.279
- [bleep].
Not the hair on my arm.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.848
I'd like to say
that's the first time

10:47.881 --> 10:49.416
I've burned
all the hair off my arm,

10:49.449 --> 10:51.852
but it's happened
many times before.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.420
Pulled the blade
out of the oil,

10:53.453 --> 10:55.255
and it's got
a pretty good warp to it.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.290
I can fix it in the next round,

10:57.324 --> 10:59.126
if I'm fortunate enough
to make it.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.062
- Ten! Nine! Eight!

11:02.095 --> 11:04.998
Seven! Six! Five!

11:05.032 --> 11:09.302
Four! Three! Two! One!

11:09.336 --> 11:11.772
Bladesmiths, drop your tools,
shut down your machines!

11:11.805 --> 11:13.941
*

11:13.974 --> 11:17.310
- Overall, I'm pretty happy
with what I've produced.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.446
While there are
some issues with it,

11:19.479 --> 11:21.915
those are things
that definitely can be fixed

11:21.949 --> 11:24.417
if I get to this next round.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.120
- My blade stacks up very well

11:27.154 --> 11:29.122
with the other bladesmiths.

11:29.156 --> 11:34.027
I can see it in their eyes
that maybe there's some worry,

11:34.061 --> 11:37.164
and that right there
was worth my trip.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.367
[tense music]

11:40.400 --> 11:42.970
- Bladesmiths,
you were each handpicked

11:43.003 --> 11:46.106
to represent a judge
in this competition.

11:46.139 --> 11:49.042
Now it's time for them to take
a closer look at your work.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.478
Josh, you're up first.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.814
*

11:53.847 --> 11:55.983
- Josh, you turned in
beautiful work last time,

11:56.016 --> 11:58.118
and that's why I asked you
to come back.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.487
I think your blade looks
really nice overall.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.756
I like your edge geometry.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.958
There's a little bit
of a warp in it,

12:04.992 --> 12:07.460
but I think that's something
that you know how to fix.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.429
Well done.
- Thank you.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.931
- Mareko, you're up.

12:10.964 --> 12:14.367
*

12:14.401 --> 12:15.869
- Looking at your blade,

12:15.903 --> 12:18.171
this is exactly
why I chose you.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.907
Classic things that you did.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.842
You prepared everything,
you weren't in a hurry,

12:21.875 --> 12:23.343
you stayed cool.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.878
You have a slight warp,

12:24.912 --> 12:27.247
but overall,
I feel like a proud papa.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.549
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.018
- Erin, you're up next.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.186
*

12:33.220 --> 12:34.454
- One of the reasons
I wanted you back

12:34.487 --> 12:36.957
is your hammer work's great.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.892
You moved metal by hand

12:38.926 --> 12:39.960
more than you moved it
with the machines,

12:39.993 --> 12:41.795
which is amazing to watch.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.230
And seeing you
drift these holes.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.465
Now, I'm sure
why that one's there.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.001
- Back home,
we have fish with teeth,

12:48.035 --> 12:51.471
so I slide that hole
over the shank of the fish hook.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.040
and turn it.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.142
It rolls the hook
out of their mouth.

12:55.175 --> 12:58.011
- Cool, so you brought us
a unique design as well.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.580
And the fact that
you drifted those in by hand--

13:00.613 --> 13:02.482
I just love that.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.417
- David, you're up.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.854
*

13:06.887 --> 13:09.890
- Well, David, you spent
probably a good 15 minutes or so

13:09.923 --> 13:11.925
just playing around with
torquing that blade,

13:11.959 --> 13:13.460
trying to straighten it out,

13:13.493 --> 13:15.462
but you still ended up with

13:15.495 --> 13:17.164
a substantial warp in there.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.599
- I can get it out
in the next grind.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.469
- It feels really nice.
I like the thickness of it.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.471
Nicely done.
You did a great job.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.940
I'm glad I brought you back.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.175
- Well, bladesmiths,

13:28.208 --> 13:29.877
the judges have
a lot to talk about,

13:29.910 --> 13:31.411
so they're gonna take
some time to deliberate.

13:31.444 --> 13:35.615
*

13:35.648 --> 13:38.018
- Wow,
that's a brutal challenge.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.552
- It was pretty wild.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.921
- All right, gentlemen,

13:40.954 --> 13:42.422
let's get into
the finer details.

13:42.455 --> 13:45.458
Let's start with
Doug's pick, Mareko.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.227
- Overall,
I liked the shape of his blade.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.163
I liked the feel.
The beauty is in there.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.365
There are some issues,
like the warp,

13:52.399 --> 13:54.935
but nothing I would look at
as a catastrophic failure.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.369
*

13:56.403 --> 13:59.306
- Jason,
let's move on to your guy.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.608
- Overall,
I liked Josh's finish.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.877
I mean,
he's got the nicest finish.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.312
I think it's a little skinny--

14:05.345 --> 14:07.314
I'd prefer a wider knife
for chopping--

14:07.347 --> 14:10.250
but his edge geometry
is excellent.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.352
He did great.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.055
- All right, J.,
how do you think Dave did?

14:15.088 --> 14:17.090
- I think he over-forged this.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.292
He ended up with,
you know, deep hammer marks

14:19.326 --> 14:20.961
up here in the spine.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.395
It'll be very difficult
to get rid of those,

14:22.429 --> 14:25.632
and that could cause
a serious failure.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.969
- And last but not least,
Dave's pick, Erin.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.537
*

14:30.570 --> 14:32.072
- One of the things
I really enjoyed seeing

14:32.105 --> 14:33.573
was a new technique,

14:33.606 --> 14:35.408
having someone drift holes
in their blade.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.377
I've never seen
anybody do that.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.980
But it seems to me
he actually cut

14:40.013 --> 14:41.214
inches off the end
of this blade.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.083
*

14:43.116 --> 14:45.085
- Oh, they're measuring.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.954
*

14:46.987 --> 14:50.090
- So, gentlemen, have you made
your final decision?

14:50.123 --> 14:51.424
- Yep.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.226
- All right,
let's go tell our smiths.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.694
*

14:54.727 --> 14:57.164
Bladesmiths,
we'd love to keep you all,

14:57.197 --> 15:00.267
but it's time for one of you
to leave the Forge.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.636
*

15:03.670 --> 15:08.008
Erin, unfortunately,
your blade did not make the cut.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.610
Since he's the guy who advocated
for you to come back,

15:10.643 --> 15:12.412
Dave will explain.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.481
- Erin,
it came down to one thing,

15:14.514 --> 15:16.283
and that was the length
of that blade.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.419
Your blade didn't make
the basic length parameters.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.654
About a inch shy.

15:21.688 --> 15:25.025
But I gotta tell ya,
you didn't let me down at all.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.359
You brought us a technique

15:26.393 --> 15:28.295
we have never seen
on the show before,

15:28.328 --> 15:30.230
and that's drifting those holes.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.265
I really appreciate
you bringing that to me,

15:32.299 --> 15:34.534
and I appreciate you
being my champion.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.269
- Thank you.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.138
- Erin,
please surrender your blade.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.073
*

15:40.107 --> 15:43.210
- Disaster.
Disaster just happened.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.579
I'm going home because
my blade was a little shorter

15:46.613 --> 15:48.681
than the specs required.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.151
Love you guys.
- All right, brother.

15:51.184 --> 15:55.122
- Dave Baker said
that I didn't let him down.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.157
Think that's an honor.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.526
I just, uh...

15:59.559 --> 16:01.194
it's in a touch place
right now.

16:01.228 --> 16:05.198
*

16:05.232 --> 16:08.068
I think I'm done.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.669
*

16:09.702 --> 16:11.438
- Bladesmiths, congratulations,

16:11.471 --> 16:12.705
you've made it to
the second round,

16:12.739 --> 16:14.607
and of course, in this round,

16:14.641 --> 16:16.176
you know you'll be attaching
handles to your blades

16:16.209 --> 16:18.245
to turn them into
fully functional weapons

16:18.278 --> 16:21.081
that will then be tested
in an apple slice

16:21.114 --> 16:23.683
and chopping into an antler.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.053
Just to make things
a little bit more complicated,

16:26.086 --> 16:27.354
you must incorporate

16:27.387 --> 16:29.556
at least two of
the handle materials

16:29.589 --> 16:31.358
into your handle's design.

16:31.391 --> 16:34.227
You will have three hours
in this challenge.

16:34.261 --> 16:37.264
Good luck, bladesmiths.
Your time starts now.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.233
[rock music]

16:40.267 --> 16:41.701
*

16:41.734 --> 16:44.671
- My plan for the handle is...

16:44.704 --> 16:46.173
I don't really have a plan.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.340
*

16:47.374 --> 16:49.042
When I heat-treated the blade,

16:49.076 --> 16:51.244
it ended up being
a little wiggly,

16:51.278 --> 16:53.813
so I have to
grind that straight.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.317
The antler chop is
potentially devastating,

16:57.350 --> 16:59.286
so making sure that

16:59.319 --> 17:01.421
the knife is able to handle
that kind of work

17:01.454 --> 17:04.224
is gonna be my top priority.

17:04.257 --> 17:07.660
*

17:07.694 --> 17:12.465
- I'm on the grinder
to fix the warp in the blade

17:12.499 --> 17:16.436
and to produce the type of
geometry that I want,

17:16.469 --> 17:19.739
so that it'll prevail
inhe cutting tests.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.709
- Look at David just cranking on
his blade over here.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.612
I mean, he's really putting
some stress into that thing.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.680
- That takes some guts,

17:27.714 --> 17:29.516
or something else.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.783
Rhymes with guts.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.253
*

17:33.286 --> 17:34.821
- When the judges say
I have to use two materials,

17:34.854 --> 17:36.423
I'm actually excited,

17:36.456 --> 17:38.691
because I was planning
on that, anyway.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.860
So I decide to step it up
a little bit

17:40.893 --> 17:42.529
and grab another
handle material

17:42.562 --> 17:44.797
to underlay under
all the other stuff.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.333
So I'm gonna be using
three handle materials

17:46.366 --> 17:49.169
instead of two,
which should impress the judges.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.838
- Josh's handle on his Kora
is actually what lost him

17:51.871 --> 17:53.773
the title of
"Forged in Fire" champion.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.676
Do you think he's gonna be
paying attention and making sure

17:56.709 --> 17:58.545
everything's indexed
and just right?

17:58.578 --> 18:01.248
- Oh, yeah.
- I would think so, yeah.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.616
- You have two hours remaining
to finish your work!

18:03.650 --> 18:05.318
*

18:05.352 --> 18:06.819
- Never worked with
this pine cone stuff,

18:06.853 --> 18:08.788
but I always thought
it looked pretty damn cool.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.490
My biggest motivator,
I would say,

18:10.523 --> 18:13.326
is being able to provide
for my family.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.863
I have a fresh little
six-month-old baby boy.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.765
Until about six months ago,

18:18.798 --> 18:22.269
my wife and I actually lived in
a little 20-foot motor home.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.803
Being "Forged in Fire"
champion

18:23.836 --> 18:25.738
is an opportunity to help
get a good deposit down

18:25.772 --> 18:26.873
and get a house for us.

18:26.906 --> 18:30.310
*

18:30.343 --> 18:33.680
- It seems like David is
working at a different pace

18:33.713 --> 18:35.482
than our other smiths.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.285
- The other guys
didn't have an accident.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.154
They've been working straight
through these last two years,

18:41.188 --> 18:44.557
so I'm up against some pretty
stiff competition here.

18:44.591 --> 18:48.695
However,
I'm feeling amazingly relaxed.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.397
I ended up choosing

18:50.430 --> 18:53.800
this lovely brown material
with blue dots in it,

18:53.833 --> 18:55.802
kind of like leopard skin.

18:55.835 --> 18:59.472
And also this gray piece
that has silver specks in it.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.174
It's really important to me

19:01.208 --> 19:03.510
to make the handle
and the blade go together.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.546
Kind of a feng shui,
if you will.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.183
*

19:10.217 --> 19:12.485
- Josh is like the shop phantom.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.587
He's just floating around,
keeping quiet,

19:14.621 --> 19:16.623
and knocking his stuff out.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.592
- That went together
like freaking butter.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.428
- Two hours has elapsed!

19:21.461 --> 19:23.663
You have one hour remaining
to finish your work!

19:23.696 --> 19:25.698
*

19:25.732 --> 19:27.900
- I do feel like
what I'm putting together

19:27.934 --> 19:30.437
is a little bit on
the simpler side,

19:30.470 --> 19:32.872
but I think it's a pretty damn
good looking blade.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.607
It's a got a shark fin
on the top.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.543
Doug's got a thing for sharks.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.645
But it also doubles as
an egg cracker.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.647
Boom!
Right on the top of the head.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.684
*

19:44.717 --> 19:47.420
- With 30 minutes left,
I'm feeling the pressure.

19:47.454 --> 19:48.621
*

19:48.655 --> 19:51.291
It's hard to stay focused.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.693
I'm glancing at the clock.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.828
- He's looking at that clock,
like, every three minutes now.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.497
- Yeah.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.332
- Starting to get
a little nervous here.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.234
*

20:01.268 --> 20:02.402
- [bleep].
- Oh, [bleep].

20:02.435 --> 20:03.670
- No.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.844
- The grinder pulls my blade
out of my hands.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.580
*

20:13.613 --> 20:14.914
When it hit the steel table,

20:14.947 --> 20:17.884
it put a little nick
in the edge.

20:17.917 --> 20:21.488
It's a pretty violent throw
from a machine.

20:21.521 --> 20:22.889
*

20:22.922 --> 20:24.924
- That could've been bad.
- Yeah.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.460
- David's getting flustered
right now.

20:27.494 --> 20:30.630
And then over here, we have
the picture of tranquility.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.965
- Josh is just plugging along,
doing the Josh thing.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.502
*

20:35.535 --> 20:38.438
- Ten, nine, eight,

20:38.471 --> 20:41.574
seven, six, five,

20:41.608 --> 20:45.545
four, three, two, one.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.880
Bladesmiths, your time is up.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.382
[applause]

20:49.416 --> 20:51.451
- Good job, man.
- Very nice, gentlemen.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.886
- Good job, brother.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.622
- I feel really proud of
what I've accomplished

20:55.655 --> 20:57.490
in just three hours,

20:57.524 --> 20:59.926
and I think this blade's
gonna perform awesome.

20:59.959 --> 21:03.563
- I'm proud of this knife,
and win or lose,

21:03.596 --> 21:05.332
I feel good, because I'm back.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.335
*

21:08.368 --> 21:10.403
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the strength test.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.539
We're gonna have some fun today.

21:12.572 --> 21:16.509
We're gonna take your knifes
and strike antler ten times.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.645
- Holy [bleep].
- Not only is this gonna test

21:18.678 --> 21:20.647
the strength of the edge
of your knife,

21:20.680 --> 21:23.750
but also the overall durability
of the knife itself.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.318
Josh, you're up first.
You ready?

21:25.352 --> 21:26.819
- I'm ready.
- I'm ready too.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.054
- All right.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.923
*

21:30.957 --> 21:33.092
The antler test
is something I do at home,

21:33.125 --> 21:35.328
and it's extremely
aggressive on edge,

21:35.362 --> 21:37.830
so I'm definitely a bit nervous.

21:37.864 --> 21:40.833
[rock music]

21:40.867 --> 21:47.807
*

21:50.910 --> 21:52.512
- [laughing]
- Damn.

21:52.545 --> 21:53.513
- Whoo!

21:53.546 --> 21:56.716
*

21:56.749 --> 21:58.585
- Well, Josh, we kind of have

21:58.618 --> 21:59.686
almost a little serration
in the middle now.

21:59.719 --> 22:00.753
- Yeah.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.989
- It felt good swinging,

22:03.022 --> 22:05.925
but that edge damage
is concerning.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.860
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.729
There's a lot of
edge deformation in my blade.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.999
I pretty much figure I'm
finished in this competition.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.034
- Mareko, you ready?

22:15.067 --> 22:17.470
- I'm so excited.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.138
[laughter]

22:19.171 --> 22:21.107
- You know what,
honestly, that's two of us.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.975
[laughter]

22:23.009 --> 22:25.945
[tense music]

22:25.978 --> 22:32.652
*

22:32.685 --> 22:35.688
[rock music]

22:35.722 --> 22:40.627
*

22:44.163 --> 22:45.865
- Looks a lot better than mine.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.700
- It's good, man.
Didn't break.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.135
[tense music]

22:49.168 --> 22:51.504
- Well, Mareko,
for the size of this knife,

22:51.538 --> 22:54.807
it's one of the lightest knives
I've ever swung.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.676
You got deformation.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.745
Got a couple little pieces out.
- Yeah.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.613
- But it bit into the antler
really well.

23:00.647 --> 23:03.483
- Cool.
- And it held together.

23:03.516 --> 23:05.485
Good job.
- Thanks.

23:05.518 --> 23:06.919
- David, you're up next.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.588
You ready?
- I'm ready.

23:08.621 --> 23:15.528
*

23:18.465 --> 23:21.434
[rock music]

23:21.468 --> 23:28.407
*

23:32.111 --> 23:35.515
[tense music]

23:35.548 --> 23:36.783
- Nice job.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.618
*

23:38.651 --> 23:40.687
- So, David, you have a
significant bend in this blade

23:40.720 --> 23:43.122
after the testing.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.825
We've got some chipping,
some damage,

23:45.858 --> 23:48.495
right in that center spot there,

23:48.528 --> 23:49.962
but it survived.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.030
- All right.
- Good job.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.165
- Thanks.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.834
- Next we're gonna
move on to the sharpness test,

23:54.867 --> 23:56.769
and we're gonna have Jason
take care of that.

23:56.803 --> 23:59.038
*

23:59.071 --> 24:02.108
- We're gonna test
the sharpness of your blades

24:02.141 --> 24:05.044
by maybe cutting through
all of these apples.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.246
It'll depend on your knife.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.948
It it's sharp enough,

24:08.981 --> 24:11.551
we should have a clean cut
all the way through.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.553
Josh, are you ready?
- I'm ready.

24:13.586 --> 24:16.188
*

24:16.222 --> 24:19.492
My blade survived.
At least it's still intact.

24:19.526 --> 24:20.793
However, I'm pretty worried,

24:20.827 --> 24:22.895
because my edge
that used to be sharp

24:22.929 --> 24:24.831
now is badly damaged.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.600
I'm pretty worried
it's not gonna slice the apples.

24:27.634 --> 24:34.574
*

24:36.876 --> 24:39.011
- [chuckles]
Oh, nice.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.179
All right, brother.
- [laughs]

24:40.212 --> 24:42.214
- Good job.
- Thanks.

24:42.248 --> 24:45.117
- Well, Josh,
despite your edge having

24:45.151 --> 24:48.254
some chipping and wrinkling
from the antler damage,

24:48.287 --> 24:52.158
it's still sharp enough
to cut through the apples.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.893
Well done.
- Thank you.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.662
- Mareko, you ready?

24:55.695 --> 24:56.796
- Yeah, man.
- All right.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.798
*

24:58.831 --> 25:00.099
- I make kitchen knifes.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.901
I should know
how to make a knife

25:01.934 --> 25:04.136
that slices through apples
pretty damn well.

25:04.170 --> 25:10.577
*

25:10.610 --> 25:13.212
- Nice job.
- Nice job.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.047
- Nice work.
- All right, man.

25:15.081 --> 25:18.150
- Mareko, it went through that
thing like a lightsaber, man.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.052
[imitates buzzing]

25:20.086 --> 25:22.722
It just zipped right through,
like they weren't even there.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.624
Well done.
- Thanks, thank you.

25:24.657 --> 25:26.793
- David, you ready?

25:26.826 --> 25:29.028
- Kiai.
- All right, let's do it.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.063
*

25:31.097 --> 25:33.332
- My knife is definitely
more of an apple slicer.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.168
Jason is going to cut through
all the apples, I'm sure.

25:36.202 --> 25:43.910
*

25:43.943 --> 25:50.983
*

25:51.017 --> 25:54.020
- David,
during the antler testing,

25:54.053 --> 25:56.222
it has bent.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.124
The bend is actually curving up.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.126
And if I'm laying down
like this,

26:00.159 --> 26:02.128
it's accentuated,

26:02.161 --> 26:05.832
so as I'm trying to travel down,
it's very difficult

26:05.865 --> 26:08.167
to accurately
slice through those apples.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.236
*

26:10.269 --> 26:12.739
- Well, this is the Olympics
of knife making, right?

26:12.772 --> 26:14.874
I'll take a bronze any day.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.843
[laughter]
- That's right.

26:16.876 --> 26:20.346
For that, David, I commend you
and I spect you very much.

26:20.379 --> 26:21.881
- Thank you very much.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.816
- David, as you acknowledged,

26:23.850 --> 26:26.819
this time the judges' decision
is an easy one,

26:26.853 --> 26:28.888
and I have to ask you
to please leave the Forge.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.857
- Thank you, guys.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.892
I'm feeling a little sad,

26:32.925 --> 26:34.927
although I'm not ashamed.

26:34.961 --> 26:38.698
I proved to myself
that I could make a knife again.

26:38.731 --> 26:41.067
I know that people had had

26:41.100 --> 26:45.037
much more difficult times
in their life than I had,

26:45.071 --> 26:49.942
but I would tell anyone
who had a setback in life

26:49.976 --> 26:53.880
to get up, shake it off,
and start again.

26:53.913 --> 26:56.315
*

26:56.348 --> 26:58.785
- Josh, Mareko, congratulations.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.787
Both of you made
signature blades

27:00.820 --> 27:03.756
that have propelled you into
the third round of competition,

27:03.790 --> 27:06.325
giving you a chance at the title
of "Forged in Fire" champion

27:06.358 --> 27:08.394
and another shot at
that $10,000.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.797
Well, now we're gonna send
you back to your home forges

27:10.830 --> 27:13.165
to recreate
an iconic blade from history.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.333
And that weapon is...

27:14.366 --> 27:16.736
*

27:16.769 --> 27:19.071
The Ida.
- Awesome.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.807
*

27:20.840 --> 27:22.775
- The Ida is
a long cutting sword,

27:22.809 --> 27:25.745
most commonly used by the
Yoruba people of West Africa.

27:25.778 --> 27:28.848
Their idolization of Ogun,
the god of metal and war,

27:28.881 --> 27:31.050
lead their blacksmiths
to be among the most skilled

27:31.083 --> 27:32.384
in West Africa.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.053
With its leaf-shaped blade

27:34.086 --> 27:36.088
that could be
single or double-edged,

27:36.122 --> 27:37.857
the Ida was a practical tool

27:37.890 --> 27:40.059
for both agriculture
and hunting,

27:40.092 --> 27:42.795
as well as a deadly weapon
on the battlefield.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.765
In combat, it was often laced
with pepper or poison

27:45.798 --> 27:47.466
to paralyze enemies
and ensure that

27:47.499 --> 27:50.837
the slash of the Ida
left many dead in its wake.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.271
The length of the blade

27:52.304 --> 27:55.808
must be between
22 and 26 inches.

27:55.842 --> 27:58.344
Additionally,
it must have a double edge.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.046
- I've never heard of
this weapon before.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.881
I mean, I've seen weapons
that are similar,

28:01.914 --> 28:04.383
but I'm not really
a weapons expert,

28:04.416 --> 28:06.786
so if I come away with a win,
it's not gonna be a cheap win.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.988
I might make a great blade
and get beat.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.724
You know, I did last time.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.359
- You will have five days
at your home forge

28:13.392 --> 28:14.761
to complete this challenge.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.195
At the end of those five days,

28:16.228 --> 28:17.463
you will return to present
your finished Idas

28:17.496 --> 28:19.766
to the panel of judges.

28:19.799 --> 28:20.867
- I'm really proud
that I've been able to make it

28:20.900 --> 28:22.869
to the final round again.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.436
I feel like I have what it
takes to win this competition,

28:24.470 --> 28:27.807
and I also really
want to win for Doug.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.476
- It's down to just
Doug and Jason's picks.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.378
Don't let 'em down.

28:32.411 --> 28:35.848
Good luck, bladesmiths.
We'll see you in five days.

28:35.882 --> 28:38.317
- Good luck, man.
- Let's do this.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.753
[rock music]

28:40.787 --> 28:42.755
- Today's day one.
I'm back home.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.891
It's a couple below zero
this morning.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.793
It's time to get to work.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.261
Just gonna stack up
a billet of Damascus here.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.530
This is gonna be my river going
down the center of the blade,

28:51.563 --> 28:54.100
alternating layers of steel.

28:54.133 --> 28:56.235
I'm gonna be doing a really
complicated Damascus blade,

28:56.268 --> 28:59.205
with a lot of welds
and a lot of chances for error.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.040
*

29:01.073 --> 29:03.142
I was on the show last season,

29:03.175 --> 29:06.112
and I was absolutely happy
and proud of the Kora Sword

29:06.145 --> 29:07.980
when I built it,
and I still am.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.849
Just didn't win.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.351
This is a bit of
a shot at redemption for me.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.020
That thing's ready to twist.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.454
I'm twisting this metal

29:15.487 --> 29:16.889
to give it
a really cool pattern

29:16.923 --> 29:18.958
along the edge of the sword.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.993
The twisting is
a very intense process,

29:21.027 --> 29:22.962
and you're just really watching
that steel close,

29:22.995 --> 29:25.164
making sure
you're not shearing it in half.

29:25.197 --> 29:27.266
I'm gonna call that good.
I don't wanna push my luck.

29:27.299 --> 29:31.904
*

29:31.938 --> 29:33.505
- I'm back at my home forge.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.374
The challenge is
to build an Ida sword.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.977
My plan is to make
kind of a mosaic steel,

29:38.010 --> 29:39.912
which is aesthetically
really beautiful.

29:39.946 --> 29:44.150
And into the forge
and the great wide yonder.

29:44.183 --> 29:45.985
I'm gonna do
a full integral blade,

29:46.018 --> 29:47.987
which means the blade,
the guard,

29:48.020 --> 29:50.056
and the full tang
and the handle

29:50.089 --> 29:53.059
are all gonna be forged
out of the same piece of steel.

29:53.092 --> 29:55.261
The biggest concern is that
the welds might not take,

29:55.294 --> 29:57.396
so I'm just gonna
keep my fingers crossed,

29:57.429 --> 30:00.532
keep my cool, and just do the
things the way I normally do,

30:00.566 --> 30:02.969
and it should come out
just fine.

30:03.002 --> 30:06.238
It's like I'm forging
in fire or something!

30:06.272 --> 30:07.539
You see what I did there?

30:07.573 --> 30:09.909
*

30:09.942 --> 30:11.410
- It's day three.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.846
My blade's grown,
I'm ready to heat-treat,

30:13.880 --> 30:15.547
and I'm feeling pretty anxious.

30:15.581 --> 30:18.150
Two days of work
comes down to this.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.451
You just never know
what's gonna happen

30:19.485 --> 30:21.620
when you actually go
into that oil.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.189
Here goes nothing.

30:23.222 --> 30:30.162
*

30:31.230 --> 30:33.165
Mm-kay.

30:33.199 --> 30:35.034
*

30:35.067 --> 30:38.971
Baby looks
as straight as an arrow.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.940
This test piece that
I heat-treated with my sword...

30:40.973 --> 30:42.909
*

30:42.942 --> 30:44.376
I'm gonna beat up
a little antler with it

30:44.410 --> 30:45.945
and see how it does.

30:45.978 --> 30:49.081
*

30:49.115 --> 30:51.117
That one took a chunk out there.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.585
I ended up with two chunks
in the end that were missing,

30:53.619 --> 30:55.654
but I don't feel like I have
time to play with right now,

30:55.687 --> 30:57.323
but I think I'll be fine.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.026
*

31:00.059 --> 31:01.393
- It's pretty damn cold
in here,

31:01.427 --> 31:04.163
so I used my little hobo fire,

31:04.196 --> 31:06.165
an old turkey fryer.

31:06.198 --> 31:09.969
What's most important is getting
a good heat treat on the blade.

31:10.002 --> 31:13.305
So I just need to bring it up,
all to an even temperature,

31:13.339 --> 31:15.207
pull it out,
and give her a quench.

31:15.241 --> 31:22.048
*

31:22.081 --> 31:25.184
All right,
that should be plenty.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.053
It still looks
pretty dang straight.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.454
Whoo-hoo!

31:28.487 --> 31:30.322
I actually feel
a little bit ahead

31:30.356 --> 31:32.358
of where I thought
I was gonna be today.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.660
My integral guard area
is in there.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.662
I got my full tang.

31:36.695 --> 31:40.066
So the rest of it pretty much
from this point on is grinding.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.601
*

31:42.634 --> 31:44.603
- It's time to start a handle.

31:44.636 --> 31:47.639
The handle's what cost me
in the competition last year.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.442
I'm gonna choose
this African Blackwood.

31:50.476 --> 31:53.112
This sword is from West Africa,

31:53.145 --> 31:56.315
so I'm trying to keep it
somewhat authentic.

31:56.348 --> 32:00.586
I fight this battle between
staying historically correct

32:00.619 --> 32:04.023
and making something
that the judges can hang onto.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.524
It's looking good.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.326
I want the look to be
a bit of my own.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.428
The sword blade is real Ida,

32:09.461 --> 32:11.663
and the handle is real Josh.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.366
*

32:14.400 --> 32:16.435
What the [bleep]?

32:16.468 --> 32:19.972
There's a hole in the wood.

32:20.006 --> 32:22.041
There's a freakin'--
there's a hole in the wood.

32:22.074 --> 32:23.642
*

32:23.675 --> 32:25.644
Right in the middle
of the block.

32:25.677 --> 32:28.214
Usually when you see a little
pinhole like that pop up,

32:28.247 --> 32:30.983
and you keep grinding,
it just gets bigger and bigger,

32:31.017 --> 32:32.451
and you've ruined the handle.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.186
I actually think
I might be able to

32:34.220 --> 32:36.989
file through it tomorrow
if I have time.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.991
Today was a pretty wearing day,

32:39.025 --> 32:41.060
but in the end, I've got
a sword with a handle on it.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.329
I'm pretty comfortable
with where I'm at.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.496
[rock music]

32:44.530 --> 32:46.032
- We're in the homestretch.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.633
I just have
some light finish work

32:47.666 --> 32:51.103
to touch back up on the blade
before I etch it.

32:51.137 --> 32:54.040
And then reattach the handle,
and then sharpen the thing.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.774
*

32:55.807 --> 32:58.010
Feels like it's got
a little bit of a toothy edge.

32:58.044 --> 33:01.613
*

33:01.647 --> 33:03.615
It will definitely cut.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.318
I feel really good about
what I was able to accomplish.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.654
Question is whether or not
it's actually gonna survive.

33:08.687 --> 33:10.589
There's only one way
to find out,

33:10.622 --> 33:12.191
and that's to let
Doug play with it.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.659
[laughs]

33:13.692 --> 33:16.628
[dramatic music]

33:16.662 --> 33:18.330
*

33:18.364 --> 33:20.599
- Josh, Mareko, welcome back.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.401
You've had five days
at your home forge

33:22.434 --> 33:24.070
to complete your Idas.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.238
Josh, how did it go?
- It went great.

33:26.272 --> 33:30.209
I built a three-bar
composite Damascus Ida.

33:30.242 --> 33:32.511
I used African Blackwood
for the handle.

33:32.544 --> 33:35.047
Sword came from West Africa.
Thought it fit.

33:35.081 --> 33:36.515
I'm really happy with it.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.617
- Mareko, how'd it go for you?

33:38.650 --> 33:40.519
- Went pretty good for me.

33:40.552 --> 33:43.655
I built my sword out of
ladder mosaic Damascus.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.657
I did a full integral
construction,

33:45.691 --> 33:47.793
so the blade, the guard,
and the tang

33:47.826 --> 33:50.129
are all forged
from one piece of steel.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.564
I made the handle out of
Ebony Burl.

33:52.598 --> 33:53.799
Came together really nicely.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.201
*

33:55.234 --> 33:56.735
- All right, gentlemen,

33:56.768 --> 33:58.737
your weapons will now be
put through a series of tests.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.272
Good luck to both of you guys.

34:00.306 --> 34:01.273
Doug?

34:01.307 --> 34:03.475
*

34:03.509 --> 34:05.477
- This is a kill test.

34:05.511 --> 34:07.513
To see how lethal
your weapons are,

34:07.546 --> 34:08.847
I will take your weapons

34:08.880 --> 34:10.749
and deliver multiple slashes
and hacks

34:10.782 --> 34:13.152
on these ballistic dummies.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.520
Josh, you're up first.
You ready?

34:14.553 --> 34:15.854
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

34:15.887 --> 34:16.788
- All right.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.724
*

34:18.757 --> 34:20.692
Those ballistics dummies
are pretty tough.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.428
They're a hard thing
to lacerate,

34:22.461 --> 34:26.098
so this test makes me
a little bit nervous.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.867
[rock music]

34:28.900 --> 34:36.074
*

34:43.549 --> 34:46.752
- Okay, Josh,
this is a wicked blade.

34:46.785 --> 34:48.487
On the initial hack right here,

34:48.520 --> 34:50.389
the blade went
all the way through

34:50.422 --> 34:52.191
into the ribs
and broke those ribs.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.792
The other side--same thing.

34:53.825 --> 34:56.228
That would disembowel
this dummy.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.364
Your weapon will kill.

34:58.397 --> 34:59.498
- Thank you.
- Good job.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.333
- Thank you very much.

35:01.367 --> 35:02.534
- Mareko, you're next.
You ready?

35:02.568 --> 35:03.602
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

35:03.635 --> 35:04.703
- All right.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.672
[tense music]

35:06.705 --> 35:08.574
I don't know how well my
weapon's actually gonna perform,

35:08.607 --> 35:11.910
because it has kind of
a beefier edge geometry,

35:11.943 --> 35:16.482
which doesn't necessarily
lend it to slicing very well.

35:16.515 --> 35:19.451
[rock music]

35:19.485 --> 35:26.425
*

35:31.797 --> 35:33.765
[tense music]

35:33.799 --> 35:35.767
- Well, Mareko,
it is sharp.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.569
As you can see what it did,

35:37.603 --> 35:40.672
it lacerated right in
all the way to the chest cavity,

35:40.706 --> 35:42.741
breaking the ribs
that are in there.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.810
On the horizontal slashes,
same thing.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.712
It lacerated deep.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.914
Feels good, balances out,

35:48.947 --> 35:52.484
and your blade will kill.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.253
Good job.
- Thank you.

35:54.286 --> 35:57.556
- Next up is the sharpness test.

35:57.589 --> 35:59.791
To test your double-edge sword,
I will take your weapon

35:59.825 --> 36:01.827
and deliver
three slashes per blade

36:01.860 --> 36:03.829
across this web of ropes.

36:03.862 --> 36:07.766
If your Ida is sharp,
it should meet no resistance.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.401
Josh, you're up first.
You ready?

36:09.435 --> 36:12.304
- Let's do it.
- Let's do this.

36:12.338 --> 36:15.241
[rock music]

36:15.274 --> 36:22.214
*

36:24.683 --> 36:26.618
[tense music]

36:26.652 --> 36:30.389
I'll tell you, Josh,
this is definitely sharp.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.924
It met no resistance
cutting through the ropes.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.693
It feels good in the hand.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.729
Your sword, sir, will cut.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.365
Good job.
- Thank you very much.

36:39.398 --> 36:40.799
Appreciate it.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.634
- All right, Mareko,
you're my choice.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.270
You ready?
- Bring it on.

36:44.303 --> 36:45.804
- Let's do this.

36:45.837 --> 36:47.439
- Doug's the reason I'm here,

36:47.473 --> 36:49.375
and I really wanna
make him proud,

36:49.408 --> 36:51.443
so I'm just really kind of

36:51.477 --> 36:53.612
praying and hoping
that it does well.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.382
*

36:56.415 --> 36:57.616
Oh, [bleep].

37:02.721 --> 37:05.691
*

37:08.860 --> 37:10.729
[dramatic music]

37:10.762 --> 37:13.565
- Well, Mareko,
your blade is fast.

37:13.599 --> 37:14.866
It's light.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.868
It did lacerate through
some of the ropes,

37:16.902 --> 37:18.870
and some of them it didn't.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.973
Overall, though,
your blade will cut.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.509
- Thanks, Doug.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.877
- Next up is the strength test.
Dave?

37:25.911 --> 37:27.413
*

37:27.446 --> 37:29.014
- Gentlemen...

37:29.047 --> 37:31.016
to test the strength
and durability of your blades,

37:31.049 --> 37:33.419
I'm going to chop into
these femur bones three times.

37:33.452 --> 37:34.853
Now, the point of this test

37:34.886 --> 37:36.955
is not to see
how many bones I can break,

37:36.988 --> 37:39.024
but to see how well
your blades hold up

37:39.057 --> 37:40.792
through that punishment.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.060
Josh, you're up.
You ready?

37:42.093 --> 37:44.029
- I'm ready.
- All right.

37:44.062 --> 37:46.998
[rock music]

37:47.032 --> 37:54.005
*

38:02.414 --> 38:03.415
[dramatic music]

38:03.449 --> 38:04.783
- Damn.

38:04.816 --> 38:10.856
*

38:10.889 --> 38:12.858
- Everything stayed straight,

38:12.891 --> 38:14.960
everything stayed tight,

38:14.993 --> 38:18.530
but you can see we've got some
extreme chipping on that blade.

38:18.564 --> 38:20.065
*

38:20.098 --> 38:21.967
It did sizeable damage to
what we were swinging at,

38:22.000 --> 38:23.769
but you can just see those...

38:23.802 --> 38:25.036
*

38:25.070 --> 38:26.505
Those chips.

38:26.538 --> 38:27.573
*

38:27.606 --> 38:29.975
All right, Mareko,
you ready?

38:30.008 --> 38:32.411
- [laughing]
Yeah.

38:32.444 --> 38:33.945
- All right.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.515
- I did my best
to make the geometry,

38:36.548 --> 38:38.550
so it could withstand
this kind of use,

38:38.584 --> 38:41.587
but seeing the damage
that happened to Josh's sword

38:41.620 --> 38:44.756
makes my heart, like,
sink down to my stomach.

38:44.790 --> 38:47.759
[rock music]

38:47.793 --> 38:54.733
*

39:00.005 --> 39:02.941
[dramatic music]

39:02.974 --> 39:05.711
*

39:05.744 --> 39:10.048
- Well, Mareko, you did pick up
that slight bend,

39:10.081 --> 39:11.917
but your edges are beautiful.

39:11.950 --> 39:14.820
They've held up quite nicely.

39:14.853 --> 39:17.623
Nicely done.
- Thanks.

39:17.656 --> 39:20.492
This is my second time
competing on "Forged in Fire."

39:20.526 --> 39:22.928
It was a really tight race
the first time I was here,

39:22.961 --> 39:25.096
and it's a tight race again.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.065
My blade didn't perform

39:27.098 --> 39:29.601
as well as I would've liked
in the rope cutting,

39:29.635 --> 39:32.504
but Josh's blade
did take a lot of damage

39:32.538 --> 39:35.874
chopping on the femurs,
so it's in the judges hands now.

39:35.907 --> 39:41.012
*

39:41.046 --> 39:43.749
- The judges have made
their final decision,

39:43.782 --> 39:45.016
but before I give you
that decision,

39:45.050 --> 39:47.018
they have some feedback
for both of you.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.020
Jason?

39:49.054 --> 39:52.658
- Josh, I'm glad I chose you,
because I love that sword.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.593
You're pushing the boundaries

39:54.626 --> 39:57.095
of beauty and performance
in one piece,

39:57.128 --> 39:58.864
and it was impressive.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.866
- Thank you.
- Doug?

40:00.899 --> 40:03.835
- Mareko, again you turned in
a beautiful piece.

40:03.869 --> 40:06.204
And that final strength test--

40:06.237 --> 40:08.073
none of your blades
should ever be

40:08.106 --> 40:10.041
put through
something like that.

40:10.075 --> 40:12.043
It's almost criminal,
'cause they're beautiful.

40:12.077 --> 40:13.912
But when yours held up,
it showed me why I chose you.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.647
*

40:15.681 --> 40:18.884
- Josh, Mareko,
it was definitely a battle,

40:18.917 --> 40:21.520
but there can only be
one champion.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.789
The Judges' Pick
"Forged in Fire" champion is...

40:23.822 --> 40:28.527
*

40:28.560 --> 40:30.596
Mareko, congratulations.

40:30.629 --> 40:32.631
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.500
Good job.

40:34.533 --> 40:35.767
- Congratulations, man.
- Wow, thanks, buddy.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.836
Appreciate it.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.871
- Josh,
that's a beautiful piece,

40:39.905 --> 40:41.907
but with that coarse-grained
structure and the brittle edge,

40:41.940 --> 40:44.142
your sword just wasn't able to
hold up in the strength test,

40:44.175 --> 40:45.711
and that's why
we got to let you go.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.779
- No, I understand.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.081
- Josh,
please surrender your weapon.

40:50.115 --> 40:52.751
*

40:52.784 --> 40:54.986
- I feel they made
the right decision.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.988
I may not be
the "Forged in Fire" champion,

40:57.022 --> 40:59.224
but I'm still a great bladesmith
and a better dad.

40:59.257 --> 41:00.792
But I showed my kids that

41:00.826 --> 41:02.528
you step up
and you do it again

41:02.561 --> 41:03.762
and you give it your best,
and I think I did that,

41:03.795 --> 41:05.531
and I brought a beautiful sword.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.534
Looks nice,
but looks don't cut.

41:08.567 --> 41:10.536
*

41:10.569 --> 41:13.071
- Mareko, how does it feel
rising to the top,

41:13.104 --> 41:15.006
earning a check for $10,000,

41:15.040 --> 41:17.809
and being the Judges' Pick
"Forged in Fire" champion?

41:17.843 --> 41:20.178
- You know, it's definitely been
a serious challenge,

41:20.211 --> 41:22.280
but to be able to
represent for Doug,

41:22.313 --> 41:24.115
a man who I respect very much,

41:24.149 --> 41:25.884
and to make it to the end
and win--

41:25.917 --> 41:27.853
that makes me really proud.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.655
I came so close
to winning last time.

41:29.688 --> 41:31.690
It feels really good

41:31.723 --> 41:33.825
that I was actually able to
pull out the win this time.

41:33.859 --> 41:36.027
Winning the $10,000--

41:36.061 --> 41:38.063
it's gonna be so helpful
for myself, for my family.

41:38.096 --> 41:39.965
Doug, your horse won the race.

41:39.998 --> 41:42.100
I hope that I made you proud,

41:42.133 --> 41:44.302
so thanks for
bringing me back, man.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.272
