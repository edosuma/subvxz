lived together in harmony.</i>

when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

<i>Only the Avatar,

discovered the new Avatar,</i>

<i>And although his airbending
skills are great,</i>

Unh!

00:39.040 --> 00:42.000
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

01:04.150 --> 01:06.280
Hey, look!
A sword made out of a whale's tooth!

01:06.490 --> 01:07.570
Let me see that.

01:18.210 --> 01:19.670
This is a Water Tribe weapon.

01:19.790 --> 01:21.460
See if you can find anything else.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.260
Did someone lose something?

01:24.420 --> 01:25.630
No, we found something.

01:29.010 --> 01:30.140
It's burned.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.140
There was a battle.

01:33.390 --> 01:35.680
Water Tribe warriors ambushed
a group of firebenders.

01:36.140 --> 01:37.770
The firebenders fought back,

01:37.890 --> 01:39.400
but the warriors
drove them down this hill.

01:46.150 --> 01:47.610
So then what happened?

01:47.700 --> 01:49.530
I don't know. The trail ends here.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.370
Wait! Look!

01:52.120 --> 01:53.830
It's one of our boats!

01:55.700 --> 01:57.250
KATARA: Is this dad's boat?

01:57.460 --> 01:59.830
No, but it's from his fleet.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.080
Dad was here.

02:04.670 --> 02:05.960
Ahh!

02:06.340 --> 02:08.050
See, Prince Zuko?

02:39.750 --> 02:41.250
Only temporarily.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.040
The toxins will wear off
in about an hour.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.420
But by then, he'll be in jail,

02:44.500 --> 02:45.880
and I'll have my money.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.670
But how did you find him on my ship?

02:48.090 --> 02:51.180
My shirshu can smell a rat
a continent away.

02:51.510 --> 02:53.090
Well, I'm impressed.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.980
Very impressed.

03:18.950 --> 03:19.950
Sokka.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.080
I'm coming with you.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.960
You're not old enough to go to war,
Sokka. You know that.

03:24.750 --> 03:26.420
I'm strong. I'm brave.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.960
I can fight!

03:28.050 --> 03:29.420
Please, dad?

03:29.960 --> 03:32.470
Being a man is knowing
where you're needed the most,

03:32.930 --> 03:36.140
and for you right now,
that's here protecting your sister.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.310
I don't understand.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.430
Someday you will.

Sokka! Katara!

03:59.740 --> 04:01.750
It is so good to see you two.

04:01.830 --> 04:04.500
Oh. You've grown so much.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.000
Hi, I'm Aang.

04:06.210 --> 04:07.420
- Where's dad?
- Is he here?

04:07.750 --> 04:09.420
No. He and the other warriors

04:09.500 --> 04:12.260
should be in the eastern
Earth Kingdom by now.

04:23.690 --> 04:24.980
After I was wounded,

04:25.060 --> 04:26.980
your father carried me to this abbey.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.730
The sisters
have cared for me ever since.

04:30.820 --> 04:33.240
Superior, these are Hakoda's children.

04:33.320 --> 04:35.200
They've been traveling
with the Avatar.

04:35.530 --> 04:36.820
I found them by my boat.

04:37.030 --> 04:39.580
Young Avatar, it gives me great joy

04:39.660 --> 04:40.870
to be in your presence.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.000
Welcome to our abbey.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.670
Thank you.
It's truly an honor to be here.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.040

What smells so good, Bato?

04:48.420 --> 04:49.540
( SNIFFING )

04:49.750 --> 04:52.170
The sisters craft ointments
and perfumes.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.220
Perfume? Maybe we could
dump some on Appa,

04:55.300 --> 04:56.680
because he stinks so much.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.180
Am I right?

04:59.100 --> 05:00.430

Bato, it looks like home!

05:06.480 --> 05:08.860
Everything's here, even the pelts.

05:08.940 --> 05:12.570
Yeah. Nothing's cozier
than dead animal skins.

05:15.070 --> 05:16.320
Ack!

05:18.870 --> 05:21.910
No way! Stewed sea prunes?

05:22.120 --> 05:24.000
Help yourself.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.160
Dad could eat
a whole barrel of these things.

05:26.870 --> 05:29.130
( SNIFFS ) Ugh!

05:29.460 --> 05:32.800
Bato, is it true you
and dad lassoed an arctic hippo?

05:33.050 --> 05:34.420
It was your father's idea.

05:34.510 --> 05:36.170
He just dragged me along.

05:36.260 --> 05:38.220
Well, the hippo did the dragging.

05:38.430 --> 05:40.180
Hey, I ride animals, too!

05:40.260 --> 05:42.180
One time, there was
this giant eel, and I―

05:42.260 --> 05:44.770
So, who was it that came up
with the great blubber fiasco?

05:44.850 --> 05:46.350
You knew about that?

05:46.560 --> 05:47.850
Everyone does.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.190
What's that story?

05:49.270 --> 05:50.310
It's a long one, Aang.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.520
Some other time.

05:51.610 --> 05:54.320
You and dad had
so many hilarious adventures.

05:54.690 --> 05:57.280
Not all of which
were hilarious at the time,

05:57.360 --> 05:59.780
but everything's funny with hindsight.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.910
Aang!

06:00.990 --> 06:04.290
Please put that down.
It's ceremonial and very fragile.

06:05.620 --> 06:08.160
SOKKA: Was it you or dad
that put an octopus on your head

06:08.250 --> 06:09.920
and convinced gran-gran
you were a water spirit?

06:10.080 --> 06:13.670

but I did the spooky voice.

I need you to find someone.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.440
What happened?
Your girlfriend run off on you?

07:10.810 --> 07:12.190
It's not the girl I'm after.

07:12.270 --> 07:13.770
It's the bald monk
she's traveling with.

07:14.310 --> 07:15.770
Whatever you say.

07:15.860 --> 07:17.320
If you find them,

07:17.400 --> 07:19.990
I'll consider the damage
to my ship paid for.

07:20.150 --> 07:21.900
Ha! Forget it.

07:21.990 --> 07:24.740
Plus, we'll pay your weight in gold.

I should tell you kids.

I'm expecting a message
from your father.

07:48.810 --> 07:50.770
- Really?
- When?

07:50.980 --> 07:52.270
Any day now.

07:52.350 --> 07:53.940
Your father said he'd send a message

07:54.020 --> 07:55.730
when they found the rendezvous point.

07:55.940 --> 07:58.020
If you wait here
until the message arrives,

07:58.230 --> 08:00.780
you can come with me
and see your father again.

08:00.990 --> 08:03.400
It's been over two years
since we've seen dad.

08:20.050 --> 08:21.760
It would be great, but we can't.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.180
We have to take Aang
to the North Pole first.

to wait for the message,

08:26.140 --> 08:28.100
who knows how far we'd have to travel?

08:28.180 --> 08:30.140
We don't have time for a long detour.

08:30.350 --> 08:33.020
I'm sure your father would understand,

are helping the Avatar.

The winds can be brutal. So be brave.

12:12.110 --> 12:13.700
Aang, you control the jib.

12:13.780 --> 12:16.370
Without your steady hand,
we all go down.

I know that! Why wouldn't I know that?

I'm the Avatar! I know about trust.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.130
For this to be done right,
I cannot help.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.130
You pass or fail on your own.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.220
Aang, ease up on the jib.

12:38.430 --> 12:39.810
Katara, steady.

Sokka, you've already proven yourself.
Maybe we should―

13:19.220 --> 13:21.100
Aang! I'm gonna need air in that sail!

13:21.470 --> 13:23.680
Katara, I want you to bend
as much water as you can

For Sokka, the mark of the wise―

13:54.170 --> 13:56.670
The same mark your father earned.

13:57.130 --> 13:59.260
For Katara, the mark of the brave.

13:59.340 --> 14:01.640
Your courage inspires us.

14:02.100 --> 14:05.560
And for Aang, the mark of the trusted.

14:06.100 --> 14:09.190
You are now an honorary member
of the Water Tribe.

14:09.350 --> 14:10.400
I can't.

14:10.730 --> 14:11.810
Of course you can.

14:12.820 --> 14:14.860
No. You can't trust me.

14:15.070 --> 14:16.740
Aang, what are you talking about?

14:18.150 --> 14:20.110
A messenger gave this to me for Bato.

14:21.950 --> 14:24.580
You have to understand.
I was afraid you wouldn't―

14:24.660 --> 14:26.330
This is the map to our father!

14:26.410 --> 14:28.040
You had it the whole time?

14:28.330 --> 14:29.370
How could you?

14:29.620 --> 14:31.790
Well, you can go to

14:41.220 --> 14:42.600
I'm with you, Sokka.

15:02.950 --> 15:03.950
Good luck.

15:04.330 --> 15:06.160
Okay. You too.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.210
Guess I should be moving on.

That wolf sounds so sad.

15:57.670 --> 15:59.340
It's probably wounded.

15:59.550 --> 16:02.340
No. It's been separated from the pack.

16:02.550 --> 16:04.510
I understand that pain.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.550
It's how I felt when
the Water Tribe warriors

16:06.640 --> 16:08.720
had to leave me behind.

16:08.930 --> 16:10.680
They were my family,

16:10.770 --> 16:13.350
and being apart from them
was more painful than my wounds.

Sokka?

16:23.740 --> 16:24.950
We need to go back.

we're needed the most.

You're right.

16:30.410 --> 16:32.450
Your father will understand,

16:32.660 --> 16:34.290
and I know he's proud of you.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.710
Thanks, Bato.

Okay, I get it.
Everybody wants me gone.

16:51.430 --> 16:53.560
A group of people came to the abbey
looking for you.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.690
Who?

16:54.890 --> 16:56.900
A fierce-looking woman

and a young man with a scar.

16:58.860 --> 16:59.860
Zuko.

The beast was using the scent
of a necklace to follow you.
