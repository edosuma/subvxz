WEBVTT

00:00.173 --> 00:03.150
- (Laughter)
- ELIZABETH: I do, I-I love this event.

00:03.151 --> 00:06.486
Once a year, we all
get together, let loose

00:06.487 --> 00:08.855
and say what we really think.

00:08.856 --> 00:12.625
It's a triumph of free speech.

00:12.626 --> 00:15.228
Which, at $2,000 a plate, is a bargain.

00:15.229 --> 00:16.463
(laughter)

00:16.464 --> 00:18.064
This is a great opportunity

00:18.065 --> 00:20.133
for us to get to know each other.

00:20.134 --> 00:21.601
Then again, I was in the CIA,

00:21.602 --> 00:23.570
so I already know everything about you.

00:23.571 --> 00:25.305
(laughter)

00:25.306 --> 00:29.242
Chief of Staff Russell
Jackson is here tonight.

00:29.243 --> 00:30.844
You've probably read in the press

00:30.845 --> 00:32.912
he and some of the cabinet members

00:32.913 --> 00:35.281
don't always see eye to eye.

00:35.282 --> 00:38.251
I mean, honestly...

00:38.252 --> 00:40.620
how can we?

00:40.621 --> 00:42.889
Is he smiling? Please
tell me he's smiling.

00:42.890 --> 00:45.191
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:45.192 --> 00:48.628
As America's lead diplomat,

00:48.629 --> 00:50.497
I have to interface with
people of different

00:50.498 --> 00:52.198
cultural backgrounds, which is how

00:52.199 --> 00:54.567
I developed the perfect icebreaker.

00:54.568 --> 00:56.803
Stop me if you've heard this one before.

00:56.804 --> 00:59.739
A multinational,
non-denominational person

00:59.740 --> 01:02.275
walks into an uncontroversial
establishment...

01:02.276 --> 01:03.676
(laughter)

01:03.677 --> 01:06.312
Ah. You have heard it.

01:06.313 --> 01:08.181
It's been such... such a pleasure

01:08.182 --> 01:10.917
supporting the Society
for Global Aid tonight.

01:10.918 --> 01:13.453
Please thank them for all of
the incredible work they do.

01:13.454 --> 01:17.255
And thank you, thank you for coming.

01:23.130 --> 01:25.609
Killed it, man. Great job.

01:25.610 --> 01:27.743
Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:27.768 --> 01:29.303
MAN: Madam Sec... Madam Secretary.

01:29.304 --> 01:30.170
ELIZABETH: Yes?

01:30.171 --> 01:31.838
If I could just have a second.

01:31.839 --> 01:34.707
You know who was really funny: Condi.

01:34.708 --> 01:37.210
- Oh.
- She could turn a phrase, huh?

01:37.211 --> 01:39.245
But she's not as funny as you though.

01:39.246 --> 01:40.880
You're as funny as some of the men.

01:40.881 --> 01:42.382
Okay. I have to borrow the secretary

01:42.383 --> 01:43.917
for a second. We'll be right back.

01:43.918 --> 01:44.918
Matt Mahoney.

01:44.919 --> 01:46.920
Z-man!

01:46.921 --> 01:48.621
Hey, was that your stuff up there?

01:48.622 --> 01:49.956
You're a rock star, bro.

01:49.957 --> 01:51.458
God, you sound surprised.

01:51.459 --> 01:52.992
Oh, that's right.

01:52.993 --> 01:55.662
It's probably 'cause you never
put me in the Exit Players.

01:55.663 --> 01:58.298
Even when I begged you senior year.

01:58.299 --> 02:00.900
It's cool, I'm over it.

02:00.901 --> 02:03.403
(both laugh)

02:03.404 --> 02:06.105
Um, Zach, uh, I want to introduce you to

02:06.106 --> 02:08.274
- my, um...
- Colleague.

02:08.275 --> 02:10.143
- And close friend.
- Daisy.

02:10.144 --> 02:11.778
I love your blog.

02:11.779 --> 02:12.846
Oh, thank you.

02:12.847 --> 02:14.981
Yeah, I mean, everybody in our office

02:14.982 --> 02:17.317
reads the Fusillade
Press, so congrats, man.

02:17.318 --> 02:19.052
Well, you got to let me
do a feature on you.

02:19.053 --> 02:21.721
I mean, this thing's gonna be
all over the Internet tomorrow.

02:21.722 --> 02:24.190
We got to get the guy who wrote it, huh?

02:24.191 --> 02:26.426
Um... yeah.

02:26.427 --> 02:27.894
Yeah, no, that's... that-that... Yeah.

02:27.895 --> 02:29.128
Okay. Cool. Cool, yeah, we'll chat.

02:29.129 --> 02:30.763
We'll chat. Awesome.

02:30.764 --> 02:32.599
ELIZABETH: Oh, gosh,
look at that cheesecake.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.843
- I would do anything...
- I saved you cheesecake.

02:33.844 --> 02:35.635
- You did? I love you.
- I did. I put a piece aside.

02:35.636 --> 02:37.637
Secretary McCord, Secretary McCord.

02:37.638 --> 02:39.138
Would you like to
prevent the mass suicide

02:39.139 --> 02:40.673
of U.S. citizens trapped in a cult

02:40.674 --> 02:42.008
- in South America?
- Not right now. Thanks, sir.

02:42.009 --> 02:43.394
- ELIZABETH: Excuse me?
- No, uh, my name is Gary Coomer.

02:43.395 --> 02:44.277
I-I represent families

02:44.278 --> 02:45.645
who've lost loved ones to

02:45.646 --> 02:47.747
the Covenant of John mission
in Bolivia, including...

02:47.748 --> 02:49.449
- Sir, sir...
- um...

02:49.450 --> 02:51.384
my daughter, Christine.

02:51.385 --> 02:53.820
She's 22. She joined
this group last year.

02:53.821 --> 02:55.697
And then they were just
raising money for the mission,

02:55.698 --> 02:57.991
but two months ago,
with-with zero warning,

02:57.992 --> 03:00.126
184 of them flew out, they left,

03:00.127 --> 03:01.995
and this guy's got them
completely cut off.

03:01.996 --> 03:03.730
- Mr. Coomer, is it?
- Yeah.

03:03.731 --> 03:06.232
I'm gonna put you in touch
with a colleague of mine

03:06.233 --> 03:06.916
at the State Department...

03:06.917 --> 03:08.134
No, I've already contacted
the State Department

03:08.135 --> 03:09.602
and my congressman, Larry Ames.

03:09.603 --> 03:11.052
He's the one who sent
me here to find you.

03:11.053 --> 03:11.964
Oh, did he?

03:11.965 --> 03:13.473
- Back away, sir.
- Yeah, he said that

03:13.474 --> 03:16.943
if I showed you this, perhaps
we'd finally get some action.

03:16.944 --> 03:19.612
We got this e-mail two days ago...

03:19.613 --> 03:21.114
all of the families...

03:21.115 --> 03:23.950
and it says here they're
waiting for the final judgment.

03:23.951 --> 03:25.151
And this at the end here,

03:25.152 --> 03:27.186
this is Christine saying good-bye.

03:27.187 --> 03:28.855
They are all gonna kill themselves.

03:28.856 --> 03:31.457
Can... Do you mind if I hold on to this?

03:31.458 --> 03:32.592
No, please, please.

03:32.593 --> 03:34.961
I-I promise you that I
will look into this.

03:34.962 --> 03:36.829
No, don't look into it,
please, just do something.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.798
Okay? Please, before it's too late.

03:38.799 --> 03:40.736
Sir, why don't you come with me?
I'll take your information down.

03:40.737 --> 03:41.469
Great. Thank you.

03:41.470 --> 03:42.702
And let's just walk over
here for one second.

03:42.703 --> 03:44.137
- I promise you.
- All right. Thank you.

03:44.138 --> 03:45.972
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Over here, please.

03:45.973 --> 03:47.206
WOMAN: <i>Go! Go, go, go,</i>

03:47.207 --> 03:49.609
go, go, go, go. Go! Yes!

03:49.610 --> 03:52.045
(shrieking)

03:52.046 --> 03:53.880
(laughter)

03:53.881 --> 03:56.449
Guys, hey! Hey, guys! Guys!

03:56.450 --> 03:58.351
I'm trying to close a deal in Nigeria.

03:58.352 --> 04:00.353
Yeah, just test-driving the chairs.

04:00.354 --> 04:02.922
Look, i-if you want to goof
around, go work for Instagram.

04:02.923 --> 04:05.592
I'm sure they have Foosball
and vintage arcade games.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.060
But if you want to change the world,

04:07.061 --> 04:11.429
one Microloan at a time, cut
the crap, get back to work.

04:15.069 --> 04:17.170
I don't know about you guys, but...

04:17.171 --> 04:19.238
I'm inspired.

04:19.238 --> 04:21.406
(laughs)

04:21.408 --> 04:22.942
- Back to work.
- Mm-hmm.

04:22.943 --> 04:26.045
STEVIE: <i> It's actually the
best job I've ever had.</i>

04:26.046 --> 04:28.448
Impressive, considering it doesn't pay.

04:28.449 --> 04:29.749
How does your boss justify

04:29.750 --> 04:31.451
keeping you there until 10:00 at night?

04:31.452 --> 04:34.520
Um, well, we were closing
a deal in Abuja.

04:34.521 --> 04:37.757
And we are still crazily understaffed.

04:37.758 --> 04:39.258
Well, not that understaffed.

04:39.259 --> 04:41.326
I mean, you know, with the guy.

04:41.962 --> 04:43.830
What guy?

04:43.831 --> 04:45.398
Come on.

04:45.399 --> 04:47.200
You have Irish Lit at noon,

04:47.201 --> 04:49.402
but you're going into the office early

04:49.403 --> 04:53.006
after having worked
past 10:00 last night.

04:53.007 --> 04:54.440
And you're wearing a skirt

04:54.441 --> 04:57.744
and high heels to give
loans to women overseas.

04:57.745 --> 05:00.513
Could you please not
spycraft before 8:00 a.m.?

05:00.514 --> 05:01.781
Come on. What's his name?

05:01.782 --> 05:03.149
Is he at Georgetown, too?

05:03.150 --> 05:04.684
You guys are unbelievable.

05:04.685 --> 05:05.918
(laughs)

05:05.919 --> 05:07.020
Bye.

05:07.021 --> 05:08.287
Good-bye.

05:08.288 --> 05:10.089
And it's not spycraft, by the way.

05:10.090 --> 05:11.357
It's called being a mom.

05:11.358 --> 05:14.027
Is that D.C.'s very own
Tina Fey right here

05:14.028 --> 05:14.994
in our kitchen?

05:14.995 --> 05:16.496
Hilarious. Get breakfast.

05:16.497 --> 05:17.830
- Yes or no?
- Yes, please.

05:17.831 --> 05:20.299
"Secretary McCord tames the crowd

05:20.300 --> 05:23.336
like a developing nation
stockpiling enriched uranium."

05:23.337 --> 05:25.705
It's useless to try and keep
them off the Internet, right?

05:25.706 --> 05:27.073
Utterly, yeah. Okay.

05:27.074 --> 05:29.709
Come on, let's go, you guys.
Go. Bus is pulling out.

05:29.710 --> 05:32.445
Ali, breakfast. You...

05:32.446 --> 05:34.679
Here. You're eating a banana.

05:35.249 --> 05:36.916
- Good-bye.
- Love you.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.117
- Good-bye, good-bye.
- Bye.

05:38.118 --> 05:40.887
Oh, and, Henry, the, um...

05:40.888 --> 05:43.589
You know that religious
group, the Covenant of John?

05:43.590 --> 05:46.225
Uh, yeah, the one that the guy
approached you about last night.

05:46.226 --> 05:47.860
Yeah.

05:47.861 --> 05:50.663
Um, I've got my staff digging
in and around into it,

05:50.664 --> 05:52.999
but could you maybe look into it, too?

05:53.000 --> 05:55.868
See just how doomsday you
think these people are?

05:55.869 --> 05:57.737
Yeah, yeah. Of course, sure.

05:57.738 --> 06:00.073
Oh. Uh, you forgot

06:00.074 --> 06:01.808
your anti-anxiety meds.

06:01.809 --> 06:03.176
No, I didn't forget them.
I don't need them.

06:03.177 --> 06:04.577
- Babe.
- Look, I don't know

06:04.578 --> 06:06.379
what they're gonna do to me,

06:06.380 --> 06:08.347
and I cannot be off my game, Henry.

06:08.348 --> 06:09.949
Yeah, well, if you wind
up in the hospital

06:09.950 --> 06:12.085
with another panic attack,
you'll be way off your game,

06:12.086 --> 06:14.220
so just... thank you... in case.

06:14.221 --> 06:16.454
Yeah.

06:18.525 --> 06:20.359
(sighs)

06:20.360 --> 06:21.861
Okay. (sniffles)

06:21.862 --> 06:24.030
JAY: Reverend Wesley Finch,

06:24.031 --> 06:25.965
fearless leader of the Covenant of John.

06:25.966 --> 06:28.201
Not exactly Jim Jones, is he?

06:28.202 --> 06:30.336
According to his Web site,
Finch believes he is

06:30.337 --> 06:32.438
the seventh messenger,
sent to reveal the mysteries

06:32.439 --> 06:33.840
of the Book of Revelation.

06:33.841 --> 06:36.209
He also taught American history
at Baltimore City College.

06:36.210 --> 06:39.078
I had a sociology professor
that thought he was the messiah.

06:39.079 --> 06:41.246
Now he teaches spin class.

06:42.349 --> 06:43.950
So what's his group doing in Bolivia?

06:43.951 --> 06:46.452
JAY: Waiting for the end of
the world, which, according

06:46.453 --> 06:48.354
to Finch's interpretation
of the Book of Revelation,

06:48.355 --> 06:49.789
is next Thursday.

06:49.790 --> 06:51.257
And when the world
doesn't end on Thursday?

06:51.258 --> 06:53.359
JAY: It won't matter.
They'll already be dead.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.094
NADINE: So the question becomes:

06:55.095 --> 06:57.563
how do we prevent a mass
suicide without interfering

06:57.564 --> 06:59.198
with freedom of religion?

06:59.199 --> 07:01.901
Presumably, Bolivia doesn't want
a bunch of dead U.S. citizens

07:01.902 --> 07:03.102
any more than we do.

07:03.103 --> 07:05.571
Let's ask for military
or police intervention.

07:05.572 --> 07:08.207
If they balk on that, let's
see if they'll let us send in

07:08.208 --> 07:09.308
our own team.

07:09.309 --> 07:11.043
We have a delicate situation with Bolivia.

07:11.044 --> 07:13.479
(sighs) That DEA raid.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.681
NADINE: Drug Enforcement raided

07:15.682 --> 07:18.918
a coca plantation outside
of La Paz last May

07:18.919 --> 07:20.153
without full sign-off.

07:20.154 --> 07:21.788
JAY: Only problem was it
wasn't a coca plantation.

07:21.789 --> 07:22.855
Lives were lost.

07:22.856 --> 07:25.258
Relations since then are
obviously strained.

07:25.259 --> 07:27.727
So because DEA screws up,

07:27.728 --> 07:29.228
we just let these people kill themselves

07:29.229 --> 07:31.264
and their children at the
behest of a lunatic?

07:31.265 --> 07:33.766
Unfortunately, it's not
technically illegal to waste

07:33.767 --> 07:35.902
- your life at the behest of lunatics.
- Enough!

07:35.903 --> 07:37.570
Are we gonna do something
to save these people

07:37.571 --> 07:39.105
or just sit around and
dither about protocol?

07:39.106 --> 07:41.407
- Ma'am...
- Just get me an appointment with

07:41.408 --> 07:42.875
the Bolivian ambassador.

07:42.876 --> 07:45.545
I know you don't want to hear
it, but, uh, that congressman,

07:45.546 --> 07:46.112
Larry Ames...

07:46.113 --> 07:47.713
What, the guy who
ambushed me with the dad?

07:47.714 --> 07:49.315
He's making a lot of noise about it.

07:49.316 --> 07:50.950
And he's angling to chair
the Foreign Relations

07:50.951 --> 07:52.531
Subcommittee on Western
Hemisphere Affairs.

07:52.532 --> 07:53.686
Blake, get me Larry Ames' schedule.

07:53.687 --> 07:55.186
I'll handle this myself.

of the labor union was 40 years ago.

08:22.082 --> 08:24.150
Congressman Ames, mind if I hijack you

08:24.151 --> 08:25.852
- for a minute?
- Elizabeth McCord.

08:25.853 --> 08:28.588
- Y-Yeah, I know who you are.
- I know you do.

08:28.589 --> 08:31.490
'Cause you sent a traumatized
parent to ambush me

08:31.491 --> 08:32.758
at the SGA fund-raiser last night.

08:32.759 --> 08:34.327
Well, I'm glad to hear he got through.

08:34.328 --> 08:36.328
Here's the deal, Larry.

08:36.330 --> 08:39.498
You have a situation with
one of your constituents

08:39.499 --> 08:41.133
outside the U.S. borders,

08:41.134 --> 08:42.668
the State Department is here for you.

08:42.669 --> 08:45.004
- Just pick up the phone.
- Well, I tried that,

08:45.005 --> 08:47.106
and your assistant gave me
15 minutes with you in July.

08:47.107 --> 08:49.475
And I am 100% sure that if you had

08:49.476 --> 08:50.943
explained the situation to him...

08:50.944 --> 08:52.178
Send me down there.

08:52.179 --> 08:54.347
I'll get every one of them
on a plane home tomorrow.

08:54.348 --> 08:56.382
Are you familiar with
the work I did in Haiti

08:56.383 --> 08:58.718
- after the earthquake?
- Congressman...

08:58.719 --> 09:01.587
you wanted this on my
radar; it's on my radar.

09:01.588 --> 09:04.323
Now I need you to stand
down so I can do my job.

09:04.324 --> 09:05.758
Are we clear? Thank you.

09:05.759 --> 09:08.294
MIKE: <i> Why not let the doofus
go down there with cameras?</i>

09:08.295 --> 09:10.363
<i>He can bring Sean Penn while he's at it.</i>

09:10.364 --> 09:12.565
And when the cult
members kill themselves

09:12.566 --> 09:14.100
ahead of schedule because they feel like

09:14.101 --> 09:16.068
- they're being attacked?
- If they're gonna do it anyway...

09:16.069 --> 09:18.571
There's such a thing as too
pragmatic. You know that, right?

09:18.572 --> 09:20.506
It's not a theory I subscribe to.

09:20.507 --> 09:22.608
Ma'am, the Bolivian ambassador is here.

09:22.609 --> 09:24.576
(sighs)

09:25.212 --> 09:27.213
Señora Dominguez,

09:27.214 --> 09:29.782
I was hoping that maybe you'd brought

09:29.783 --> 09:33.219
some of those, um, humintas, was it?

09:33.220 --> 09:34.353
Coffee?

09:34.354 --> 09:35.655
Cream and sugar, right?

09:35.656 --> 09:37.356
Let us dispense with the
niceties, Madam Secretary.

09:37.357 --> 09:39.525
You are looking for Bolivia's assistance

09:39.526 --> 09:40.860
in interfering with the worship

09:40.861 --> 09:42.828
of your own citizens within our borders,

09:42.829 --> 09:44.096
is that right?

09:44.097 --> 09:47.900
I am concerned with
this religious group's

09:47.901 --> 09:51.470
apparent inclination toward
self-destruction, yes.

09:51.471 --> 09:54.540
And yet when your Drug
Enforcement Agency sees fit

09:54.541 --> 09:57.743
to murder the innocent children
of farmers harvesting soya,

09:57.744 --> 09:59.612
it hardly merits a phone call
from your predecessor.

09:59.613 --> 10:01.514
Again, as we've said publicly,

10:01.515 --> 10:03.649
we deeply regret that tragic incident.

10:03.650 --> 10:05.117
Save your apology.

10:05.118 --> 10:06.953
Brown lives are cheaper than white ones.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.888
We see that again and
again in your country.

10:08.889 --> 10:11.057
Preventing the loss of any human life

10:11.058 --> 10:13.526
is surely a cause we can
both agree on today,

10:13.527 --> 10:15.994
isn't it, Madam Ambassador?

10:18.899 --> 10:20.499
What is it you wish to propose?

10:20.500 --> 10:22.735
Let us send in a team.

10:22.736 --> 10:24.370
Two Chinooks, unmarked.

10:24.371 --> 10:26.105
We bring our citizens back,

10:26.106 --> 10:29.141
your government takes full
credit for preventing

10:29.142 --> 10:30.576
a mass suicide.

10:30.577 --> 10:32.945
I've shown the e-mail
to Presidente Lafuente.

10:32.946 --> 10:34.180
It is not enough.

10:34.181 --> 10:37.116
So that's it?

10:37.117 --> 10:39.251
You're just willing to
let these people die?

10:39.252 --> 10:41.454
The people your government
slaughtered did not

10:41.455 --> 10:44.690
choose to die for their
beliefs, Madam Secretary.

10:44.691 --> 10:48.294
If you want our help,

10:48.295 --> 10:51.364
you're going to have to
find something more.

10:51.365 --> 10:55.568
A danger my people
can readily understand.

10:55.569 --> 10:58.236
ELIZABETH: <i> Let's just say
she was a bit underwhelmed.</i>

10:58.237 --> 11:00.039
We need to find something

11:00.040 --> 11:02.074
to convince Bolivia there's a threat.

11:02.075 --> 11:05.511
Find out if... anyone's
growing pot on the compound,

11:05.512 --> 11:07.646
or if any of the kids are sick.

11:07.647 --> 11:09.982
Uh, illegal firearms might work.

11:09.983 --> 11:11.183
Right... that's what ATF used

11:11.184 --> 11:12.885
with the Branch Davidians in Waco.

11:12.886 --> 11:15.321
Because that went so well.

11:15.322 --> 11:17.123
Just find something to get Bolivia

11:17.124 --> 11:19.525
back in our corner, fast.

11:19.526 --> 11:20.826
Thank you, guys.

11:20.827 --> 11:22.495
Good night.

11:22.496 --> 11:24.263
Oh. (chuckles)

11:24.264 --> 11:26.332
Congressman Larry Ames.

11:26.333 --> 11:27.967
Ask the speaker's office

11:27.968 --> 11:30.503
to deny him any travel to Bolivia.

11:30.504 --> 11:33.438
And when the congressman asks why?

11:34.107 --> 11:37.075
I'd like his sage counsel close.

11:43.984 --> 11:45.251
Wow!

11:45.252 --> 11:47.153
Nice dress.

11:47.154 --> 11:48.888
Where's mystery man taking you?

11:48.889 --> 11:51.023
You do realize that
you're eating cold pasta

11:51.024 --> 11:52.358
with your coat on?

11:52.359 --> 11:54.427
Oh. You hear that?

11:54.428 --> 11:55.828
Skillful misdirect.

11:55.829 --> 11:57.263
Yeah, she learned from the best.

11:57.264 --> 11:58.397
Aw.

11:58.398 --> 12:01.099
(doorbell rings)

12:07.274 --> 12:09.375
What are you doing here?

12:09.376 --> 12:11.143
What... I told you I was coming.

12:11.144 --> 12:13.846
No, no. I texted you that I
was gonna meet you there.

12:13.847 --> 12:15.214
Oh. Sorry, my phone died.

12:15.215 --> 12:17.016
Okay, well, you signed in
with security and everything?

12:17.017 --> 12:18.317
Yeah. I had to.

12:18.318 --> 12:20.553
You haven't told your
parents about me, have you?

12:20.554 --> 12:23.254
No. Let's just talk about
it on the way, okay?

12:25.525 --> 12:26.625
Hey.

12:26.626 --> 12:28.861
Hey, Dad.

12:28.862 --> 12:30.329
Uh...

12:30.330 --> 12:32.064
this is Arthur.

12:32.065 --> 12:33.399
Hello, Ar-Arthur?

12:33.400 --> 12:35.101
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:35.102 --> 12:36.735
I know you.

12:36.736 --> 12:39.071
Indeed you do. Madam
Secretary, Arthur Gilroy.

12:39.072 --> 12:40.706
Microloans guy.

12:40.707 --> 12:42.975
Um, w-we should really get going.

12:42.976 --> 12:44.710
You're dating your boss.

12:44.711 --> 12:47.480
No, I-I'm an unpaid intern.

12:47.481 --> 12:49.315
Technically...

12:49.316 --> 12:51.150
he's not... my boss.

12:51.151 --> 12:52.885
Technically, I'm <i> his</i> boss.

12:52.886 --> 12:55.087
Why don't you come in,
Arthur, have a drink?

12:55.088 --> 12:57.523
Uh, well, Stevie's not of
age yet, but you certainly

12:57.524 --> 12:59.859
- look like you are.
- Good one, Dad.

12:59.860 --> 13:02.593
It's-it's fine. Uh, happy to.

13:05.632 --> 13:07.365
(chuckles)

13:07.968 --> 13:10.101

HENRY: Where are you guys going tonight?

13:22.579 --> 13:25.132
Eden. It's the new vegan
place on Logan Circle.

13:25.133 --> 13:27.792
Oh, yeah, so some kale
smothered in kale sauce.

13:27.793 --> 13:29.002
(chuckles) Ha.

13:29.003 --> 13:32.339
So how long have you two been?

13:32.340 --> 13:34.240
Uh, it's about a month.

13:34.241 --> 13:37.553
Yeah, we sort of were
keeping it under the radar

13:37.554 --> 13:40.154
until we knew if it was something.

13:41.691 --> 13:44.727
Uh, well, it turns out it's something.

13:44.728 --> 13:48.931
So, um, microloans, Arthur...
how'd you get into that?

13:48.932 --> 13:50.666
Well, I studied finance in college.

13:50.667 --> 13:53.035
And when was that? College.

13:53.036 --> 13:55.404
- He's 39, Mom.
- I-It's okay, it's okay.

13:55.405 --> 13:56.839
I... Listen, I get it.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.641
You have concerns about
me dating your daughter.

13:58.642 --> 14:00.142
Well, you are twice her age...

14:00.143 --> 14:01.310
And her boss.

14:01.311 --> 14:02.845
I'm s-sitting right here.

14:02.846 --> 14:04.146
No. You know what? They're right.

14:04.147 --> 14:05.613
I would have questions, too.

14:06.249 --> 14:07.683
Uh, o-o...

14:07.684 --> 14:09.351
I'm from Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

14:09.352 --> 14:11.353
Uh, I went into finance out of Wharton.

14:11.354 --> 14:13.656
Worked 14 years at Goldman.

14:13.657 --> 14:15.057
Uh, got married.

14:15.058 --> 14:17.259
- Have a daughter, Ruby.
- (groans softly)

14:17.260 --> 14:18.894
She's, uh, eight now.

14:18.895 --> 14:21.864
Uh, condo on the Upper West
Side, house in the Hamptons,

14:21.865 --> 14:23.032
the whole thing.

14:23.033 --> 14:25.134
One day, I'm walking
past the Occupy tents

14:25.135 --> 14:28.204
at Zuccotti Park, and it hits me:

14:28.205 --> 14:30.239
I'm the one percent.

14:30.240 --> 14:34.076
So I got a tent, pitched it,

14:34.077 --> 14:37.046
discovered microloans
are my real passion.

14:37.047 --> 14:40.382
Uh, my wife did not
share my new thinking,

14:40.383 --> 14:42.952
we got divorced three years ago,

14:42.953 --> 14:45.019
and, uh...

14:46.323 --> 14:49.891
(chuckles): Well... here I am.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.162
Indeed, here you are.

14:53.163 --> 14:55.464
Look, there have been times in my life

14:55.465 --> 14:57.967
when I chose not to follow the rules.

14:57.968 --> 15:01.170
And it turns out... those have been

15:01.171 --> 15:05.073
some of the best choices I've ever made.

15:06.409 --> 15:07.409
(inhales sharply)

15:07.410 --> 15:08.544
(sighs)

15:08.545 --> 15:10.246
(Henry sighs)

15:10.247 --> 15:12.515
♪ ♪

15:12.516 --> 15:14.683
- ZACH: All right, one last question.
- MATT: Uh-huh?

15:14.684 --> 15:17.486
ZACH: What life experience
was your best preparation

15:17.487 --> 15:20.256
to become a big-time D.C. speechwriter?

15:20.257 --> 15:22.291
Okay.

15:22.292 --> 15:24.093
Oh. Space camp.

15:24.094 --> 15:26.228
- (laughs): What?!
- I'm serious.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.731
I-I did it the, uh, the summer

15:28.732 --> 15:29.999
- after fifth grade.
- Uh-huh.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.333
It totally inured me

15:31.334 --> 15:35.371
against all hope of respect
or recognition from my peers.

15:35.372 --> 15:38.874
Uh, I wore my uniform to the
first day of sixth grade.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.075
I'm serious.

15:40.076 --> 15:42.645
I still have it, in fact.

15:42.646 --> 15:44.046
It's in my closet.

15:44.047 --> 15:46.248
Don't put that in there.

15:46.249 --> 15:50.085
The point is, when you go that deep...

15:50.086 --> 15:52.855
the bullies can't touch you.

15:52.856 --> 15:55.291
Commitment is your armor.

15:55.292 --> 15:56.025
Bam!

15:56.026 --> 15:57.393
- Bam!
- I love it, dude!

15:57.394 --> 15:59.428
Yeah! Wow.

15:59.429 --> 16:01.096
Hey, I got plenty more

16:01.097 --> 16:02.731
- where that came from.
- Save it.

16:02.732 --> 16:05.367
And watch out, brother, things
could really change for you.

16:05.368 --> 16:07.236
- Really?
- I'm serious.

16:07.237 --> 16:09.038
That clip of M-Sec doing your material

16:09.039 --> 16:10.339
is getting mad play, okay?

16:10.340 --> 16:13.409
You grab this moment,
you could be the next...

16:13.410 --> 16:14.810
somebody cool.

16:14.811 --> 16:15.544
Colbert?

16:15.545 --> 16:17.012
Not Colbert-cool.

16:17.013 --> 16:19.247
But, like, Jason Jones, maybe.

16:19.816 --> 16:22.384
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

16:22.385 --> 16:24.453
Look, there's a whole
world out there, okay?

16:24.454 --> 16:27.590
Once you decide to step out
from under the shadows.

16:27.591 --> 16:29.625
- Cheers, buddy.
- Thanks, brother.

16:29.626 --> 16:31.126
All right, man.

16:31.127 --> 16:32.861
HENRY: Well, Arthur, you have to admit,

16:32.862 --> 16:34.096
your investments are supporting

16:34.097 --> 16:36.165
the economies of some
pretty objectionable regimes.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.167
It's an interesting ethical
dilemma, actually.

16:38.168 --> 16:39.268
No, not really.

16:39.269 --> 16:41.237
See, that's the beauty of microlending.

16:41.238 --> 16:43.305
We're skipping the government,
and actually changing things

16:43.306 --> 16:44.707
- from within.
- Really?

16:44.708 --> 16:46.075
Um, what time is that reservation?

16:46.076 --> 16:49.612
So you're helping disempowered
women start businesses,

16:49.613 --> 16:52.293
but the system that disempowered
them in the first place,

16:52.294 --> 16:54.026
the men who might steal their profits...

16:54.027 --> 16:55.417
or the loan themselves, for that matter...

16:55.418 --> 16:58.187
the very government who is refusing

16:58.188 --> 17:01.190
their basic human rights,
you're fixing all that, too?

17:01.191 --> 17:03.158
I-I just think that we're
not in the business

17:03.159 --> 17:04.926
of judging other cultures.

17:04.928 --> 17:07.128
So which is it... you're
changing things from within,

17:07.130 --> 17:08.804
or you're not in the business
of judging other cultures?

17:08.805 --> 17:09.330
Down, Dad.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.532
Should we maybe order Chinese?

17:11.534 --> 17:14.069
No, we may not like it,
but democracy is no longer

17:14.069 --> 17:15.503
a prerequisite for a healthy economy.

17:15.505 --> 17:17.205
Look at Singapore. Hell, look at China.

17:17.207 --> 17:19.508
You're confusing democracy
with basic human rights, but...

17:19.509 --> 17:21.210
Do you want to jump in on this?

17:21.211 --> 17:22.944
No, I think you're doing just fine.

17:22.945 --> 17:25.714
No, Arthur's right... we-we
<i>are</i> changing things.

17:25.714 --> 17:28.150
We're helping people improve their lives

17:28.151 --> 17:30.886
by allowing them to
become entrepreneurs.

17:30.887 --> 17:32.521
This from a girl who wanted to join

17:32.522 --> 17:34.790
the Communist Party in high school...

17:34.791 --> 17:37.126
(laughs): a couple of years ago.

17:37.127 --> 17:39.194
Well, I'm open to new ideas.

17:39.195 --> 17:41.229
She's vegan now.

17:42.399 --> 17:43.932
Uh, you know what?

17:43.933 --> 17:45.734
Maybe I should go check
on our reservation.

17:45.735 --> 17:47.101
Yeah.

17:48.772 --> 17:50.404
Well...

17:51.975 --> 17:55.811
...he seems like a very
passionate young man.

17:55.812 --> 17:57.846
Well, man, anyway. (chuckles)

17:57.847 --> 17:59.747
He's definitely got convictions.

18:01.685 --> 18:03.885
(mouthing)

18:04.421 --> 18:06.021
ELIZABETH: <i>Let's face it,</i>

18:06.022 --> 18:08.857
you were gonna go after that guy

18:08.858 --> 18:10.926
- no matter what he said.
- He was so smug,

18:10.927 --> 18:13.762
with that whole "Saul on
the road to Zuccotti Park".

18:13.763 --> 18:17.466
And Stevie parroting all
his half-baked opinions.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.335
Yeah, it was weird.

18:19.336 --> 18:21.804
It's usually she just parrots
<i>your</i> half-baked opinions.

18:21.805 --> 18:23.005
Hey.

18:23.006 --> 18:27.076
She considers them,
because they're... right.

18:27.077 --> 18:29.110
(laughs)

18:29.746 --> 18:32.114
I don't love him, either.

18:32.115 --> 18:36.952
But if we just nod and smile,
he'll be gone in six months.

18:36.953 --> 18:39.321
You promise?

18:39.322 --> 18:41.056
Well, if I'm wrong,

18:41.057 --> 18:43.959
we'll have a cute new
granddaughter named Ruby.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.295
Oh, God, now I'm having a panic attack.

18:46.296 --> 18:47.463
(sighs)

18:47.464 --> 18:48.996
Oops. Sorry.

18:50.667 --> 18:53.001
So, did you see it?

18:53.002 --> 18:56.038
Your old college buddy calling
you a "hot new voice"?

18:56.039 --> 18:57.339
Yes, I saw it.

18:57.340 --> 19:00.008
Now Zach wants me to host Fusillade's

19:00.009 --> 19:01.744
fifth anniversary party.

19:01.745 --> 19:04.480
This could open a whole
new future for me.

19:04.481 --> 19:08.484
I didn't realize you weren't
so happy with your old future.

19:08.485 --> 19:09.985
What? You don't approve?

19:09.986 --> 19:12.855
I just think you need to be more discreet.

19:12.856 --> 19:16.558
What is wrong with me
getting a little attention?

19:16.559 --> 19:19.260
Hot New Voice, my office. Now.

19:25.435 --> 19:27.302
You know this isn't really your office.

19:27.303 --> 19:30.105
Shut up and sit.

19:30.106 --> 19:32.641
Oh, I thought you were
talking to your dog.

19:32.642 --> 19:33.742
Gordon's at day care,

19:33.743 --> 19:36.043
and I would never use
that tone with him.

19:41.918 --> 19:44.086
(sighs)

19:44.087 --> 19:47.790
So I hear you're an
undiscovered comic gem.

19:47.791 --> 19:49.892
Must be very exciting.

19:49.893 --> 19:51.493
I didn't write it.

19:51.494 --> 19:54.729
Let's hear it. Make me laugh.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.700
Come on, let 'er rip.

19:58.701 --> 20:01.236
It's 200 words in a blog.

20:01.237 --> 20:03.372
There's an old Beltway expression:

20:03.373 --> 20:05.340
"Staff ink stinks."

20:05.341 --> 20:08.343
Your job here is to make
one person look good,

20:08.344 --> 20:09.845
and that person is not you.

20:09.846 --> 20:11.814
Hey, I can have a life, dude.

20:11.815 --> 20:13.515
No.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.350
You can't.

20:15.351 --> 20:19.621
Now back to the shadows
to happily toil in obscurity.

20:19.622 --> 20:21.490
Otherwise, we'll find someone
from the teeming horde

20:21.491 --> 20:22.990
to take your place.

20:30.066 --> 20:32.668
Madam Secretary.

20:32.669 --> 20:34.436
Oh, this doesn't look good.

20:34.437 --> 20:36.939
Congressman Ames showed up at
the Covenant of John compound

20:36.940 --> 20:38.707
this morning in Bolivia
demanding the release

20:38.708 --> 20:40.108
of its members.

20:40.109 --> 20:41.510
Wait. Wh-What?

20:41.511 --> 20:42.945
And now they're holding <i> him.</i>

20:42.946 --> 20:45.447
Holding him hostage?

20:45.448 --> 20:48.417
How did Ames even get
out of the country?

20:48.418 --> 20:50.886
I-I left specific instructions...

20:50.887 --> 20:52.754
He found some last-minute
humanitarian group

20:52.755 --> 20:54.089
- to sponsor him.
- Are you kidding me?

20:54.090 --> 20:56.358
Reverend Finch just posted
this on their Web site.

20:56.359 --> 20:58.494
To those who would wish to interfere

20:58.495 --> 20:59.962
with the holy mission of the Covenant

20:59.963 --> 21:01.897
of John in Bolivia, know this:

21:01.898 --> 21:07.636
by attempting to alter
our path in any way...

21:07.637 --> 21:10.772
you will be treated as
enemies of the holy word.

21:10.773 --> 21:13.208
He says they're keeping the congressman

21:13.209 --> 21:15.477
in an undisclosed location
until final judgment.

21:15.478 --> 21:17.379
And if anyone tries to interfere,

21:17.380 --> 21:18.947
they'll take him with them.

21:18.948 --> 21:21.617
They're threatening to
<i>kill</i> a U.S. congressman?

21:21.618 --> 21:23.552
Well, at least now we have something

21:23.553 --> 21:25.053
to convince Bolivia to get involved.

21:25.054 --> 21:28.823
It's too late now... we've
lost the element of surprise.

21:30.426 --> 21:32.861
Tell me they have Sean Penn, too.

21:32.862 --> 21:34.830
NADINE: The congressman
was taken at gunpoint,

21:34.831 --> 21:36.431
so we know they're armed.

21:36.432 --> 21:38.497
I hate to pile on, but
Intel says the group

21:38.498 --> 21:40.168
has been stockpiling potassium cyanide.

21:40.169 --> 21:41.637
It's a highly lethal neurotoxin.

21:41.638 --> 21:43.505
DAISY: It's what they used in Jonestown.

21:43.506 --> 21:45.073
Sorry, uh, Mr. Jackson
would like a word.

21:45.074 --> 21:46.308
Uh, not right now.

21:46.309 --> 21:47.609
NADINE: I could reach out

21:47.610 --> 21:49.177
gently to Ambassador Dominguez.

21:49.178 --> 21:50.279
Now...

21:50.280 --> 21:53.916
C-Can you just call?
Why do you never call?

21:53.917 --> 21:56.685
You mind telling me how some
lunatic-fringe Bible camp

21:56.686 --> 21:59.421
just turned into a flaming pile of crap?

21:59.422 --> 22:01.056
ELIZABETH: Congressman
Ames made an end run

22:01.057 --> 22:03.525
around me, but we're on it.
We're just now figuring...

22:03.526 --> 22:06.660
Yeah, well, don't bother.
We're turning it over to D.O.D.

22:07.297 --> 22:09.797
Can you guys give us a minute, please?

22:11.267 --> 22:12.767
Mike.

22:16.506 --> 22:18.440
Russell,

22:18.441 --> 22:20.642
that compound is on a hair trigger.

22:20.643 --> 22:23.579
Sending in the military is just
gonna push them over the edge.

22:23.580 --> 22:25.914
Which is exactly what
we're trying to avoid.

22:25.915 --> 22:28.917
What we're trying to avoid is
another U.S. government official

22:28.918 --> 22:30.385
getting killed.

22:30.386 --> 22:32.454
JSOC's already done an
assessment on sending a team in.

22:32.455 --> 22:35.090
They say we can avoid up
to 60% of the members

22:35.091 --> 22:36.525
from dying by their own hand.

22:36.526 --> 22:37.926
And what about the congressman?

22:37.927 --> 22:39.928
We're not gonna just let
them take him to paradise.

22:39.929 --> 22:41.029
Not without a fight.

22:41.030 --> 22:42.598
Just give me 24 hours!

22:42.599 --> 22:44.066
Don't have it!

22:44.067 --> 22:46.668
Dalton's back on his heels
'cause of this coup in Iran.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.236
We need to get in front of this.

22:48.237 --> 22:51.071
So either get on board
or get out of the way.

22:54.177 --> 22:56.043
(sighs)

23:11.971 --> 23:13.505
Ma'am.

23:13.506 --> 23:15.574
Not right now.

23:15.575 --> 23:18.510
There's someone here who I
think you'll want to see.

23:18.511 --> 23:19.845
(door opens)

23:19.846 --> 23:21.647
ELIZABETH: Mr. Coomer.

23:21.648 --> 23:23.348
Hi. Hi.

23:23.349 --> 23:24.650
Please sit.

23:24.651 --> 23:27.686
Uh, I heard about Congressman Ames.

23:27.687 --> 23:30.522
Now you see what these
lunatics are capable of.

23:30.523 --> 23:32.558
Well, it definitely got
everyone's attention.

23:32.559 --> 23:34.925
Mr. Coomer...

23:37.230 --> 23:39.298
...we are doing everything we can.

23:39.299 --> 23:42.901
Yeah. Yeah.

23:42.902 --> 23:45.304
Yeah.

23:45.305 --> 23:48.707
Uh... when my wife
couldn't get pregnant,

23:48.708 --> 23:51.977
some f... some fertility
group gave her this.

23:51.978 --> 23:53.979
And I thought it was silly,

23:53.980 --> 23:56.415
but after she was wearing
it for a few weeks,

23:56.416 --> 23:57.583
Chrissie was coming.

23:57.584 --> 23:59.818
So I figured

23:59.819 --> 24:03.354
if it brought her to us once,
it could bring her to us again.

24:06.660 --> 24:08.761
ELIZABETH: <i>How do we avoid another Waco?</i>

24:08.762 --> 24:11.430
Well, this situation has a
lot of the same elements:

24:11.431 --> 24:13.766
fervent believers holed
up in a compound,

24:13.767 --> 24:16.736
uh, an impatient government
dying to storm in...

24:16.737 --> 24:18.704
Then how do we talk them out of it?

24:18.705 --> 24:20.773
Well, it's about their beliefs.
I'm not sure that you can.

24:20.774 --> 24:22.007
So that's it?

24:22.008 --> 24:25.111
I just give up and let the cavalry in?

24:25.112 --> 24:27.146
You know, I saw Finch preach online.

24:27.147 --> 24:29.115
He's not a typical cult leader.

24:29.116 --> 24:32.151
He encourages his followers to
question, and he likes debate.

24:32.152 --> 24:34.220
- He's a scholar.
- He's a kidnapper.

24:34.221 --> 24:35.855
I think he's scared.

24:35.856 --> 24:38.524
A lot of doomsday cult leaders
feel painted into a corner,

24:38.525 --> 24:39.792
like they need to deliver

24:39.793 --> 24:41.794
on all the promises they've been making.

24:41.795 --> 24:44.597
So we need to give him a way out?

24:44.598 --> 24:48.400
I mean, give him something
that he can use to convince

24:48.401 --> 24:50.703
his followers that this
isn't their time to go.

24:50.704 --> 24:52.972
Yeah, possibly. There's nothing
in Revelation about suicide.

24:52.973 --> 24:56.208
That's good. I think the main
thing is to make him feel heard.

24:56.209 --> 24:59.545
You know, in Waco, Koresh was
at an absolute standoff

24:59.546 --> 25:01.247
with the FBI until a couple

25:01.248 --> 25:03.415
of religious scholars got him
talking about his beliefs,

25:03.416 --> 25:05.217
the Bible, and then
that's when he was ready

25:05.218 --> 25:06.285
to come out peacefully.

25:06.286 --> 25:09.622
So scholars almost saved the day

25:09.623 --> 25:10.756
at Waco, huh?

25:10.757 --> 25:13.025
Okay. There's no way of telling how that

25:13.026 --> 25:14.760
- might have turned out.
- Did you reach out to him?

25:14.761 --> 25:18.364
Babe, I am not an expert
on apocalyptic literature.

25:18.365 --> 25:22.368
But you are a world-renowned
biblical scholar.

25:22.369 --> 25:25.638
Just one phone call.

25:25.639 --> 25:27.206
One phone call.

25:27.207 --> 25:28.874
DALTON: <i>So you want me</i>

25:28.875 --> 25:31.410
to hold off on rescuing a U.S. congressman

25:31.411 --> 25:33.779
being held prisoner
by a suicidal cult leader

25:33.780 --> 25:35.314
so your husband can

25:35.315 --> 25:37.650
chat with him on the
phone about Scripture?

25:37.651 --> 25:39.251
Reverend Finch left for Bolivia

25:39.252 --> 25:41.821
because the federal
government wouldn't grant him

25:41.822 --> 25:44.490
the tax-exempt status
of a faith-based group.

25:44.491 --> 25:46.325
So you're blaming the IRS?

25:46.326 --> 25:48.594
He wants legitimacy.

25:48.595 --> 25:50.362
That's what Henry can bring.

25:50.363 --> 25:53.065
I mean, not only is he an
internationally acclaimed

25:53.066 --> 25:54.300
theological scholar,

25:54.301 --> 25:57.837
but he is the husband of
the Secretary of State.

25:57.838 --> 25:59.538
A phone call from him?

25:59.539 --> 26:01.807
And he has consulted for the Pentagon,

26:01.808 --> 26:03.409
he's worked with the NSA.

26:03.410 --> 26:05.878
He'll know how to work with the guy.

26:05.879 --> 26:08.948
ELIZABETH: Congressman Ames
has that group on edge.

26:08.949 --> 26:10.983
You send in a team of Navy SEALs,

26:10.984 --> 26:14.854
you're looking at a success rate of... 40%?

26:14.855 --> 26:16.889
60%. Optimally.

26:16.890 --> 26:19.992
ELIZABETH: But this is
a chance to do better.

26:19.993 --> 26:22.361
You want to project an image of power.

26:22.362 --> 26:23.629
But a debacle

26:23.630 --> 26:26.065
like the one in Waco would
be far more damaging

26:26.066 --> 26:28.366
than a failed phone call.

26:31.938 --> 26:34.338
You've given me an idea, Bess.

26:36.142 --> 26:38.811
I think we need to take
every advantage here.

26:38.812 --> 26:40.312
No half measures.

26:40.313 --> 26:43.181
If we're gonna do this, let's
send Henry down there.

26:45.252 --> 26:48.120
JACKSON: (stammers) You really
think that's necessary?

26:48.121 --> 26:49.455
DALTON: He'll have backup.

26:49.456 --> 26:52.490
If things go south, our
team will move right in.

26:55.262 --> 26:57.663
CAPTAIN: Land outside La Paz at 0500,

26:57.664 --> 26:59.665
meet up with the SEAL
team, then chopper in.

26:59.666 --> 27:02.735
We should be on the ground near
the compound by mid-morning.

27:02.736 --> 27:04.670
I'll give you a minute, Dr. McCord.

27:04.671 --> 27:06.939
How did I let you agree to this?

27:06.940 --> 27:08.774
You know that I've
always wanted to visit

27:08.775 --> 27:11.176
the Jesuit Missions of Chiquitos.

27:11.177 --> 27:15.080
Couldn't we have made it
our next family vacation?

27:15.081 --> 27:18.049
It's the right thing to do.

27:19.653 --> 27:21.987
Do you think you'll
have God on your side?

27:21.988 --> 27:24.388
I got you.

PARKER: You have a problem
being the Cardinal today, sir?

27:58.425 --> 27:59.825
HENRY: Why don't we just go with Pope?

27:59.826 --> 28:02.127
Oh, and "Alamo" is the distress code?

28:02.128 --> 28:03.329
Isn't that a little cliché?

28:03.330 --> 28:06.098
Would you tell him to shut
up and get on with it?

28:06.099 --> 28:08.734
Bravo Team is in position.
Snipers are hot.

28:08.735 --> 28:10.302
Sn... Whoa.

28:10.303 --> 28:12.770
We're not gonna risk
another hostage situation.

28:43.603 --> 28:46.003
(chickens clucking)

28:47.907 --> 28:49.975
- Professor McCord?
- Yes.

28:49.976 --> 28:51.610
I'm Christine.

28:51.611 --> 28:53.412
I can take you to see Wesley now.

28:53.413 --> 28:55.547
That's Gary Coomer's daughter.

28:55.548 --> 28:58.217
CHRISTINE: I'm sorry. Just the professor.

28:58.218 --> 29:00.686
HENRY: I cleared this with Reverend Finch.

29:00.687 --> 29:03.822
And he apologizes for his change of heart.

29:03.823 --> 29:06.691
If you'd like to come back another time?

29:15.568 --> 29:17.770
HENRY: It's okay. Stand down.

29:17.771 --> 29:20.439
He can't go in alone. He needs backup.

29:20.440 --> 29:22.840
It's all right. Go ahead.

29:24.944 --> 29:26.712
PARKER: Cardinal flying in solo.

29:26.713 --> 29:28.379
No wire, no visual.

29:35.021 --> 29:37.421
Welcome to our home.

29:45.131 --> 29:48.901
Henry, what the hell did you just do?

29:48.902 --> 29:51.435
He got in.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.600
(chickens clucking)

30:13.539 --> 30:15.872
(congregation singing nearby)

30:34.236 --> 30:35.721
SOLDIER: We've lost
visual on Cardinal, sir.

30:35.722 --> 30:38.657
Can we get some remote
audio or something, please?

30:38.658 --> 30:41.794
HILL: They're working on
a long-range microphone.

30:41.795 --> 30:44.563
(static crackles, feedback drones)

30:44.564 --> 30:47.166
Okay. We have ears.

30:47.167 --> 30:50.569
(garbled radio transmission)

30:50.570 --> 30:54.539
You know, there are lot of
beautiful missions in Bolivia.

30:58.946 --> 31:00.346
Dr. McCord.

31:00.347 --> 31:01.647
This is so cool.

31:01.648 --> 31:02.982
Reverend Finch.

31:02.983 --> 31:04.851
Oh, call me Wesley, please.

31:04.852 --> 31:06.486
You met Jeff?

31:06.487 --> 31:08.955
Uh, yeah, we were just, uh, chatting.

31:08.956 --> 31:10.790
Yes. Uh, thank you for having me.

31:10.791 --> 31:12.125
Are you kidding?

31:12.126 --> 31:14.727
When I read your paper,
I said, "This guy is it.

31:14.728 --> 31:16.696
We got to get him in here."

31:16.697 --> 31:20.533
That part about faith
is like a silent bell?

31:20.534 --> 31:22.935
Oh... uh, "Faith is a bell unrung.

31:22.936 --> 31:25.037
"Its silence is an arc

31:25.038 --> 31:26.405
of possibility."

31:26.406 --> 31:29.208
FINCH: As defined by
loss as it is by hope.

31:29.209 --> 31:32.277
Why do you study God?

31:36.083 --> 31:39.385
I was an altar boy at Our
Lady of Good Counsel.

31:39.386 --> 31:42.088
And one Sunday, Father Joseph asked me

31:42.089 --> 31:44.123
to ring the bells during the mass.

31:44.124 --> 31:45.258
You know, the... the consecration,

31:45.259 --> 31:46.826
the big moment of transubstantiation.

31:46.827 --> 31:48.895
- I'm familiar.
- Yes, right, of course.

31:48.896 --> 31:51.330
Well, the time came and
Father Joseph held up

31:51.331 --> 31:54.367
the host and said,
"Do this in remembrance of me."

31:54.368 --> 31:56.735
And I...

31:58.338 --> 32:00.638
I didn't ring the bells.

32:05.946 --> 32:07.647
A couple weeks earlier,

32:07.648 --> 32:10.183
my best friend Tommy was
playing hockey on the pond.

32:10.184 --> 32:13.151
He went under the ice,
and they couldn't...

32:14.755 --> 32:17.155
He didn't come up.

32:18.792 --> 32:20.426
(clears throat)

32:20.427 --> 32:21.727
Anyway, after mass,

32:21.728 --> 32:26.132
Father Joseph said to me,
"It's okay, Henry.

32:26.133 --> 32:29.701
God goes silent on us all."

32:30.370 --> 32:32.238
A priest

32:32.239 --> 32:35.374
admitting that God went silent on him?

32:35.375 --> 32:36.676
(claps hands)

32:36.677 --> 32:38.010
I was in.

32:38.011 --> 32:39.111
So that settled it?

32:39.112 --> 32:40.880
No, no, no, no. That started it.

32:40.881 --> 32:41.881
(chuckles)

32:41.882 --> 32:43.282
Uh, faith is a quest.

32:43.283 --> 32:46.618
It's not a panacea, but you know that.

32:49.289 --> 32:51.055
Thank you, Christine.

32:53.794 --> 32:55.962
- Have some tea.
- Thank you.

32:55.963 --> 32:58.097
He knows how to win the guy's trust.

32:58.098 --> 33:01.234
He doesn't tell that
story to just anyone.

33:01.235 --> 33:03.135
Looks like it worked.

33:03.136 --> 33:06.372
Am I the only one thinking
he shouldn't drink the tea?

33:06.373 --> 33:08.706
(sighs heavily)

33:11.979 --> 33:13.779
HENRY: Right, but you have to concede

33:13.780 --> 33:15.982
that according to hypostatic union,

33:15.983 --> 33:19.151
asserting Christ's exclusive
divinity would be heresy.

33:19.152 --> 33:21.287
Oh, there's a reason I
stopped going to church.

33:21.288 --> 33:23.055
- Let me ask you something, Wesley.
- He's just getting going.

33:23.056 --> 33:24.123
Why is this,

33:24.124 --> 33:26.025
now, the time of the Fifth Seal for you?

33:26.026 --> 33:28.461
War.

33:28.462 --> 33:30.429
Famine.

33:30.430 --> 33:31.497
Death.

33:31.498 --> 33:33.032
The destruction of the planet.

33:33.033 --> 33:34.867
HENRY: You know what I'm gonna say.

33:34.868 --> 33:37.670
The 21st century did not
invent war or famine or death.

33:37.671 --> 33:42.675
"And I saw when the Lamb
opened one of the seals,

33:42.676 --> 33:45.444
"one of the four beasts
saying, 'Come and see.'

33:45.445 --> 33:48.281
And I saw a white horse: and
he that sat on him had a bow.."

33:48.282 --> 33:50.483
Did someone arrive on a
white horse, Wesley?

33:50.484 --> 33:52.351
"...and a crown was given unto him:

33:52.352 --> 33:54.820
and he went forth conquering,
and to conquer."

33:54.821 --> 33:56.656
Congressman Ames...
did he come in a white car?

33:56.657 --> 33:59.225
FINCH: This isn't about a car, Henry.

33:59.226 --> 34:00.559
I've been chosen.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.561
I don't know why I've been chosen.

34:02.562 --> 34:04.930
My sins are more than
the hairs on my head.

34:04.931 --> 34:06.399
But I have seen what's coming.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.600
What if you're wrong?

34:07.601 --> 34:10.101
The Chalcedonian Creed
said that Jesus was human,

34:10.103 --> 34:11.237
and therefore fallible.

34:11.237 --> 34:12.371
Couldn't you be making mistakes?

34:12.371 --> 34:14.407
And the Nicene Creed said
he was fully divine.

34:14.408 --> 34:15.507
No more debate.

34:15.509 --> 34:17.243
You're a father, Henry.

34:17.244 --> 34:19.045
You know what the world
can do to your children,

34:19.045 --> 34:20.780
how Satan can snuff out their light.

34:20.781 --> 34:22.181
You'd do anything to prevent that.

34:22.181 --> 34:24.649
But here's the thing:
they have to choose it.

34:28.922 --> 34:31.757
There's a new thought about Revelation,

34:31.757 --> 34:35.661
that John was actually writing
about Asia Minor pulling away

34:35.661 --> 34:37.697
from the rest of the
Christian community.

34:37.697 --> 34:39.031
I'm not familiar with that.

34:39.032 --> 34:40.900
You must have had that conflict
here among your followers.

34:40.900 --> 34:43.436
There must have been members who
did not want to come to Bolivia.

34:43.437 --> 34:45.071
Those who came here
are those who believe.

34:45.072 --> 34:46.806
Then open the gate, have
faith in your followers

34:46.806 --> 34:49.505
- the way they have faith in you.
- I'm not holding anyone here by force.

34:49.507 --> 34:50.909
You're holding that congressman.

34:50.911 --> 34:54.347
If there are those among you who
do not hear the bells anymore,

34:54.348 --> 34:55.915
then open that gate.

34:55.916 --> 34:57.516
(clattering, glass shattering)

34:57.517 --> 34:59.452
- What the hell just happened?
- Damn it, we need a visual.

34:59.453 --> 35:00.482
Working on it, sir.

35:00.483 --> 35:03.228
PARKER: Sniper two, eyes on cardinal.

35:04.991 --> 35:06.292
He's almost got him.

35:06.293 --> 35:07.693
PARKER: Cardinal engaged.

35:07.694 --> 35:08.928
Waiting on a clear shot.

35:08.929 --> 35:10.896
Sir, he's not in distress.

35:10.897 --> 35:11.997
He didn't say "Alamo".

35:11.998 --> 35:13.599
Let's see how this plays out.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.000
JEFF: You don't know what you want.

35:15.001 --> 35:16.335
You had us all come out here,

35:16.336 --> 35:18.170
and now you just want
to open up the gate

35:18.171 --> 35:19.972
and let everyone off to damnation?

35:19.973 --> 35:21.474
Jeffrey, we are just talking.

35:21.475 --> 35:23.175
He's turning you.

35:23.176 --> 35:24.143
Let him go.

35:24.144 --> 35:25.344
And you don't even see it.

35:25.345 --> 35:26.812
We need to take this guy out.

35:26.813 --> 35:28.114
It'll cause mayhem.

35:28.115 --> 35:29.215
SNIPER: Still no shot.

35:29.216 --> 35:30.616
Holding for a clear shot.

35:30.617 --> 35:32.518
HENRY: ...can go very badly
for you, but it doesn't have to.

35:32.519 --> 35:33.819
There are people who need to know

35:33.820 --> 35:35.321
that Congressman Ames is safe.

35:35.322 --> 35:36.689
They just need to know where he is.

35:36.690 --> 35:37.757
I told you, that's all he cares about!

35:37.758 --> 35:38.758
HENRY: Listen to me now, Wesley.

35:38.759 --> 35:40.659
It's an unrighteous act...

35:40.660 --> 35:41.694
if you harm that man.

35:41.695 --> 35:42.762
He's got a knife.

35:42.763 --> 35:44.029
SNIPER: Still no clean shot.

35:44.030 --> 35:45.231
Hold on, Henry.

35:45.232 --> 35:46.532
HENRY: It's a mark on
you, an affront to God.

35:46.533 --> 35:47.800
He's the enemy.

35:47.801 --> 35:49.101
Wesley, tell me where he is.

35:49.102 --> 35:50.935
Is he here on the compound?

35:51.838 --> 35:54.005
Is he here?

35:55.308 --> 35:57.342
(silenced gunshot)

36:00.414 --> 36:03.482
Sniper achieved target. Cardinal's good.

36:03.483 --> 36:05.117
No, don't look at him.
Don't look at him.

36:05.118 --> 36:06.752
You need to tell me where
the congressman is.

36:06.753 --> 36:08.454
If you want to save them
all from damnation,

36:08.455 --> 36:09.722
tell me where he is now.

36:09.723 --> 36:10.856
He's just outside the compound

36:10.857 --> 36:13.659
in a bunker, off to the east side.

36:13.660 --> 36:15.127
All right, all right, we've got him.

36:15.128 --> 36:16.929
SNIPER: Bravo moving in
to retrieve secondary target.

36:16.930 --> 36:17.963
They'll get him out, Bess.

36:17.964 --> 36:19.532
Why hasn't he said "Alamo"?

36:19.533 --> 36:22.435
- Any reaction to the sniper shot?
- Nothing that we're picking up.

36:22.436 --> 36:23.502
FINCH: I have to lead them.

36:23.503 --> 36:24.804
HENRY: No, I think you need to pray.

36:24.805 --> 36:25.938
Christine is heading for the tent.

36:25.939 --> 36:28.374
You were chosen by God, then pray, pray.

36:28.375 --> 36:30.276
Pray with me.

36:30.277 --> 36:31.310
Dear Lord.

36:31.311 --> 36:32.578
Dear Lord.

36:32.579 --> 36:34.280
We beseech you.

36:34.281 --> 36:35.181
We beseech you.

36:35.182 --> 36:36.582
In the hour of our darkness.

36:36.583 --> 36:38.350
In the hour of our darkness.

36:38.351 --> 36:39.418
The time is nigh.

36:39.419 --> 36:42.354
No. No.

36:42.355 --> 36:44.290
The time is nigh!

36:44.291 --> 36:46.592
The time is nigh!

36:46.593 --> 36:48.060
Christine, no!

36:48.061 --> 36:49.762
Alamo! Alamo!

36:49.763 --> 36:51.630
Alamo!

36:51.631 --> 36:54.433
The time is nigh! The time is nigh!

36:54.434 --> 36:57.570
The time is nigh! The time is nigh!

36:57.571 --> 36:59.971
The time is nigh!

37:05.462 --> 37:08.430
(clamoring)

37:09.867 --> 37:12.101
You need to stop them.

37:12.102 --> 37:13.369
You're the seventh and final messenger.

37:13.370 --> 37:14.904
PARKER: Proceeding with Alpha-Omega.

37:14.905 --> 37:17.406
Helo standing by for
extraction and transport.

37:19.076 --> 37:20.710
Wesley, you've got to stop them.

37:20.711 --> 37:23.011
It's too late.

37:24.582 --> 37:26.948
You shouldn't have betrayed me, Henry.

37:35.893 --> 37:37.393
(gunfire)

37:37.394 --> 37:38.028
Who's shooting?

37:38.029 --> 37:39.796
SEAL: Under fire,
engaging hostile target.

37:39.797 --> 37:42.483
- Have they evacuated the tent?
- HILL: There's a group taking refuge.

37:42.484 --> 37:43.668
They've barricaded themselves in.

37:43.669 --> 37:45.726
- Did they have the poison with them?
- HILL: We're trying to determine...

37:45.727 --> 37:46.769
Okay.

37:46.770 --> 37:48.438
Go to four.

37:48.439 --> 37:50.773
We've located the congressman.

37:50.774 --> 37:53.376
- He's walking.
- Thank the Lord for small miracles.

37:53.377 --> 37:55.879
Can we please get my
husband out of there?

37:55.880 --> 37:58.713
- What's the status on Henry, damn it?
- Still engaging.

38:02.486 --> 38:04.120
(gunfire)

38:04.121 --> 38:07.368
PARKER: We have the Cardinal.
Target is safe.

38:07.369 --> 38:09.102
He's good.

38:10.005 --> 38:11.306
(sighs)

38:11.307 --> 38:13.707
(clamoring continues)

38:16.579 --> 38:18.880
Hell of a play.

38:18.881 --> 38:20.782
Yes. Right.

38:20.783 --> 38:22.516
Sniper one?

38:24.153 --> 38:26.154
SEAL 2: Squad Commander to JSOC.

38:26.155 --> 38:27.789
We breached the barricade.

38:27.790 --> 38:29.491
It appears to be a mass casualty event.

38:29.492 --> 38:32.960
Estimated 30 dead.

38:33.930 --> 38:36.330
They had the poison.

38:59.555 --> 39:02.823
♪ ♪

39:24.701 --> 39:26.368
37 dead.

39:26.369 --> 39:28.103
Henry, look,

39:28.104 --> 39:31.306
look at how many you brought home.

39:31.307 --> 39:34.143
I was so focused on trying
to get through to Finch

39:34.144 --> 39:36.478
that I ignored his deputy.

39:36.479 --> 39:39.715
I-I should have tried to
connect with him, too.

39:39.716 --> 39:41.750
It was working; Finch was listening.

39:41.751 --> 39:43.085
It's like what you said.

39:43.086 --> 39:44.420
You can't change their beliefs.

39:44.421 --> 39:46.689
(sighs)

39:46.690 --> 39:48.157
You still saved so many more

39:48.158 --> 39:50.625
than they would have without you.

39:56.433 --> 40:00.368
That girl, Christine, that
let you into the compound?

40:01.538 --> 40:03.437
No.

40:08.578 --> 40:10.978
Where is she?

40:15.652 --> 40:18.052
I'm so sorry.

40:25.962 --> 40:28.362
She did it herself?

40:32.268 --> 40:34.302
(groans)

40:46.683 --> 40:48.383
STEVIE: So, you know how I thought

40:48.384 --> 40:51.286
that my Irish poetry
professor was a psychopath?

40:51.287 --> 40:52.488
(both chuckle)

40:52.489 --> 40:56.525
I think she might just be
a frustrated romantic.

40:56.526 --> 40:58.494
She's teaching Irish poetry.

40:58.495 --> 40:59.828
You started on Yeats, yet?

40:59.829 --> 41:02.531
A little, yeah.

41:02.532 --> 41:03.832
I tell you, at the end,

41:03.833 --> 41:07.236
he got into these crazy fantastic

41:07.237 --> 41:09.171
Hindu theosophical beliefs, I mean...

41:09.172 --> 41:12.107
Okay, Dad, the religion
conference is over.

41:12.108 --> 41:14.777
How was that, by the way?

41:14.778 --> 41:17.713
It was, uh... surprisingly eventful.

41:17.714 --> 41:18.714
Hmm.

41:18.715 --> 41:19.915
Damn it.

41:19.916 --> 41:21.083
What?

41:21.084 --> 41:22.251
This isn't non-GMO.

41:22.252 --> 41:24.419
Well, maybe it's cisgenic.

41:24.420 --> 41:26.421
Could be just two plants
grafted together.

41:26.422 --> 41:28.023
Farmers have been
doing that for centuries.

41:28.024 --> 41:30.359
Okay, well, tell that to all of Europe,

41:30.360 --> 41:32.194
because everything
over there is non-GMO.

41:32.195 --> 41:35.531
That's not exactly true.

41:35.532 --> 41:38.133
Uh, wh-where's all this
coming from anyway?

41:38.134 --> 41:39.835
What is that supposed to mean?

41:39.836 --> 41:41.837
It just seems that you've been

41:41.838 --> 41:43.305
a bit under Arthur's thrall.

41:43.306 --> 41:45.240
Really?

41:45.241 --> 41:47.409
I thought you liked his convictions.

41:47.410 --> 41:48.811
Well, I'd like them better

41:48.812 --> 41:50.978
if they weren't automatically
becoming your convictions.

41:50.979 --> 41:51.880
Non-GMO is my conviction.

41:51.881 --> 41:54.216
- Arthur isn't even vegan.
- Oh, well, then...

41:54.217 --> 41:56.885
What is your problem? You've
been totally weird about him.

41:56.886 --> 41:59.149
I don't like it that he's
40 and dating someone

41:59.150 --> 42:00.073
- half his age.
- He's 39.

42:00.074 --> 42:01.044
And he's your boss.

42:01.045 --> 42:03.231
Come on, as if age actually
matters that much.

42:03.232 --> 42:06.544
- I don't like his fuzzy thinking.
- Not everything is about thinking.

42:06.545 --> 42:07.979
Some people actually do stuff.

42:07.980 --> 42:09.847
They don't just sit around

42:09.848 --> 42:12.283
in an ivory tower, coming up
with debates and arguments.

42:12.284 --> 42:14.018
You think that's what I
do, just sit around?

42:14.019 --> 42:16.654
You know what, you don't have
to like Arthur, but I do, a lot.

42:16.655 --> 42:19.489
I might even love him, and you
can't debate me out of that!

42:27.532 --> 42:29.899
Well played, Professor.

42:31.035 --> 42:32.769
No, really.

42:32.770 --> 42:34.738
- It'll be a beautiful wedding, I'm sure.
- Ha, ha.

42:34.739 --> 42:37.303
I-I just can't sit around

42:37.304 --> 42:39.305
and watch her get brain
washed by this guy.

42:39.306 --> 42:42.808
Henry, she's not one of those kids.

42:42.809 --> 42:46.747
Yeah, I know, but I want
her to think for herself.

42:46.748 --> 42:49.750
Well, I think that's
what she's trying to do.

42:49.751 --> 42:52.353
You're a huge force in her life.

42:52.354 --> 42:54.488
Maybe she just needs
to tear you down a little

42:54.489 --> 42:56.356
to make some room for herself.

42:57.392 --> 43:00.026
Not to mention the guy.

43:00.863 --> 43:03.297
Okay, so when she hates
you, it's a crisis,

43:03.298 --> 43:05.666
and when it's my turn,
it's just natural progression.

43:05.667 --> 43:07.635
I know.

43:07.636 --> 43:10.837
It's so weird, that.

43:13.023 --> 43:14.656
(whispers): I'm glad you're back.
