00:04.086 --> 00:06.004
We're very different, but
I think that we bring out

00:06.088 --> 00:07.965
the best in each other.

00:08.048 --> 00:11.302
It's like you're chocolate
and I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

00:11.385 --> 00:14.554
Shut up and kiss me, you silly goof.

00:17.057 --> 00:20.727
- Cut!

00:20.811 --> 00:23.147
Welcome back to Excess Hollywoo.

00:23.230 --> 00:26.066
I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type,
and I'm visiting the set

00:26.150 --> 00:28.319
of Mr. Peanutbutter's Hollywoo Heist.

00:28.402 --> 00:30.946
I'm thrilled to be talking
to the star of the film,

00:31.029 --> 00:33.949
BoJack Horseman, and his
real life inspiration,

00:34.032 --> 00:35.159
Mr. Peanutbutter.

00:35.242 --> 00:36.868
Am I an inspiration?

00:36.952 --> 00:38.496
Well, that depends on how you define...

00:38.578 --> 00:40.872
- Wait a minute. Yes, I am.
- Ugh.

00:40.956 --> 00:43.041
You know, I'm just over
the moon to be producing

00:43.125 --> 00:45.544
this movie about my daring exploit.

00:45.627 --> 00:48.547
- Yes, your daring exploit.
- Yes.

00:48.630 --> 00:51.342
It's such a treat to be
shooting in my very own casa.

00:51.425 --> 00:55.220
And it's an even sweeter treat
to be played by my good amigo...

00:55.304 --> 00:56.805
dare I say best amigo?

00:56.888 --> 00:58.682
- You "daren't."
- We're so in tune.

00:58.765 --> 01:03.521
We even finish each other's...

01:03.603 --> 01:05.438
sentences.

01:05.522 --> 01:06.815
Sometimes it doesn't happen.

01:06.898 --> 01:07.983
- It never...
- Happens.

01:08.066 --> 01:10.610
Ah, see? I'm inside him.

01:10.694 --> 01:12.863
BoJack, you haven't
worked in quite some time.

01:12.946 --> 01:14.739
In fact, I thought you were dead.

01:14.823 --> 01:17.868
You must be so grateful to be
working again and also alive,

01:17.951 --> 01:19.911
which, again, I thought you were not.

01:19.995 --> 01:21.330
How did you get involved with this?

01:21.413 --> 01:22.581
Well...

01:22.664 --> 01:23.748
You want me to play Mr. Peanutbutter

01:23.832 --> 01:26.544
in the story he stole from me?

01:26.626 --> 01:27.919
I stole the D,

01:28.003 --> 01:29.880
and then he stole my stealing of it.

01:29.963 --> 01:32.383
That makes him an idea
thief, which is much less cool

01:32.466 --> 01:34.385
than a thief thief, which is what I am

01:34.468 --> 01:35.469
and what he also is.

01:35.553 --> 01:36.928
You know what might help?

01:37.012 --> 01:38.389
If you think about this like a professional

01:38.472 --> 01:40.015
instead of a big titty baby.

01:40.098 --> 01:42.184
This movie is a huge opportunity.

01:42.267 --> 01:45.687
Quentin Tarantulino is known
for revitalizing dead careers.

01:45.770 --> 01:47.689
This could do for you what Reservoir Dogs

01:47.772 --> 01:49.024
did for Rin Tin Tin.

01:49.107 --> 01:50.650
But isn't there any other part?

01:50.734 --> 01:52.403
I could play myself.

01:52.486 --> 01:54.572
No, BoJack's already being
played by Wallace Shawn.

01:54.654 --> 01:56.198
What? The short guy from The Princess Bride

01:56.281 --> 01:57.533
who says "inconceivable"?

01:57.616 --> 01:59.868
- Why Wallace Shawn?
- BoJack Horseman?

01:59.951 --> 02:01.245
I don't want to play that boob.

02:01.328 --> 02:02.871
I'm trying to help you out, Wally.

02:02.954 --> 02:05.499
You're the one who keeps
buying expensive Rothkos.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.251
I have a disease.

02:07.334 --> 02:10.628
Would you tell an alcoholic
to stop buying alcohol?

02:10.753 --> 02:12.756
You know, Black and Blue Number 7's

02:12.839 --> 02:14.299
going up for auction next week.

02:14.383 --> 02:15.842
Fine. I'll do the dumb movie.

02:15.926 --> 02:17.636
Fine. I'll do the dumb movie.

02:17.719 --> 02:19.888
But if you find me in a bathtub
with open wrists tomorrow

02:19.971 --> 02:22.349
and the words "I hate my
agent" smeared across the walls

02:22.474 --> 02:24.101
in blood, you'll know why.

02:24.184 --> 02:27.729
So obviously I'm thrilled
to be here, just thrilled.

So what have you been up
to these last couple months?

03:55.859 --> 03:58.778
Well, I've been pretty busy.
Met a girl at Soho House.

03:58.862 --> 04:00.405
- Was she your waitress?
- Yes.

04:00.489 --> 04:01.948
Then I met a girl at Mastro's.

04:02.032 --> 04:03.534
- Was she also your waitress?
- Yes.

04:03.617 --> 04:04.826
Then I met a girl at P.F. Chang's.

04:04.909 --> 04:06.370
Let me guess. She was your...

04:06.453 --> 04:08.372
A hooker, yes, but what
she really wants to do

04:08.455 --> 04:10.123
- is wait tables.
- [laughs]

04:10.207 --> 04:12.167
Well, I, for one, would love to meet

04:12.250 --> 04:13.544
the aspiring food-service worker

04:13.627 --> 04:15.379
who finally gets you to settle down.

04:15.462 --> 04:17.464
What? Why would I want to settle down?

04:17.548 --> 04:19.798
I'm 50.

04:19.882 --> 04:22.260
- Yeah, anyway...
- So I'm sending the first draft

04:22.344 --> 04:23.803
of the book to Pinky this afternoon.

04:23.887 --> 04:26.390
- What? It's done?
- Not yet. Almost.

04:26.473 --> 04:29.059
I'm excited for you to read it,

04:29.142 --> 04:31.061
but I'm also cripplingly nervous.

04:31.144 --> 04:33.021
I actually kind of feel like throwing up,

04:33.104 --> 04:34.814
but I can't throw up because
I haven't had anything to eat

04:34.898 --> 04:36.983

you wrote is anywhere near

04:40.820 --> 04:42.947
as great as it is to
actually spend time with you,

04:43.031 --> 04:45.075
I'm sure it's gonna be wonderful.

04:45.158 --> 04:47.202
Having said that, what
do I know about books?

04:47.285 --> 04:49.204
I'm just a dumb actor.

04:50.789 --> 04:54.459
I'm here with Hollywoo darling Naomi Watts.

04:54.543 --> 04:56.878
Tell me, what attracted
you to the role of Diane?

04:56.961 --> 04:58.630
I just keep getting pigeonholed

04:58.714 --> 05:01.174
as these complex characters
in highly acclaimed movies.

05:01.258 --> 05:03.260
For once, I would just love to phone it in

05:03.343 --> 05:05.303
and play a two-dimensional
girl in a rom com

05:05.387 --> 05:07.097
with no inner life of her own.

05:07.180 --> 05:09.516
That's kind of the reason
I got into this business.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.476
Ha ha! You said words.

05:11.560 --> 05:15.021
Now, is it true you stay
in character between takes?

05:15.105 --> 05:17.733
Oh, we all do. The
director insists upon it.

05:17.816 --> 05:20.444
He even has everyone calling me Diane

05:20.527 --> 05:22.404
to help me get in the headspace.

05:22.487 --> 05:24.030
It's been great.

05:24.114 --> 05:25.156
Diane, looking good.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.117
- Um, thanks.
- Ugh, not you.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.201
I was talking to Diane.

05:28.285 --> 05:29.661
Oh, thank you.

05:29.745 --> 05:30.788
Now, where's my peanut butter?

05:30.870 --> 05:32.247
Right over here, Q.

05:32.330 --> 05:33.373
No, I'm looking for peanut butter.

05:33.457 --> 05:34.874
Oh, you mean BoJack?

05:34.958 --> 05:36.835
If I wanted BoJack, I would call BoJack.

05:36.918 --> 05:38.837
Did someone call for BoJack?

05:38.920 --> 05:41.715
It really cuts down on confusion.

05:44.092 --> 05:47.345
Ah, show business, the great equalizer.

Is that what it is?

Todd, spritz me.

05:50.766 --> 05:53.143
- Spritzing.
- Mm, mm, mm.

05:53.226 --> 05:54.561
Well spritzed.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.354
Have you ever been on a movie set before?

05:56.438 --> 05:58.189
No, sir, Mr. Peanutbutter.

was my father's name.

06:14.790 --> 06:17.000
and produce you just for one second here.

06:17.083 --> 06:19.461
I have a few notes on
how you're playing me.

06:19.544 --> 06:21.713
Let's see. [Humming]

06:21.839 --> 06:23.715
Problems, problems,
problems, ah, here we go.

06:23.799 --> 06:26.468
I find it really troubling
that my movie self

06:26.551 --> 06:28.970
is wearing a crew neck T-shirt. [laughs]

06:29.053 --> 06:30.472
I only wear V-necks.

06:30.555 --> 06:32.015
You see the problem.

06:32.098 --> 06:33.684
- I do not.
- I just think if we're telling

06:33.767 --> 06:35.853
the story, we should tell
it how it really happened.

06:35.935 --> 06:38.229
Yeah, this whole story
isn't how it really happened.

06:38.313 --> 06:40.106
Right...

06:40.190 --> 06:41.566
because of the shirts.

06:41.650 --> 06:43.234
Because I'm the one who stole the D.

06:43.318 --> 06:44.569
I'm the real hero here.

06:44.653 --> 06:46.237
My life is full of exciting adventures.

06:46.321 --> 06:47.322
I should write a book.

06:47.405 --> 06:48.990
Oh, wait. I did.

06:49.073 --> 06:50.617
Suck on that, society.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.160
Hey, you're in a mood.

06:52.243 --> 06:53.871
Perhaps the tightness of that crew neck

06:53.953 --> 06:55.955
is cutting off circulation to the brain?

06:56.039 --> 06:57.666
Let me talk to Donna in wardrobe.

06:57.749 --> 06:59.167
We're gonna fix this, buddy.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.251
Donna!

07:03.881 --> 07:05.089
What are you doing?

07:05.173 --> 07:08.259
I'm just trying to get inside
my character, which is you.

07:08.343 --> 07:09.761
Is this how we move our arms?

07:09.845 --> 07:11.221
We're so weird.

07:11.304 --> 07:12.514
Is this really necessary?

07:12.597 --> 07:14.140
Is this really necessary?

07:14.224 --> 07:15.433
That's not what I sound like.

07:15.517 --> 07:17.268
That's not mut mi sound mike.

07:17.352 --> 07:19.270
Hey, what's it been like
since we got married?

07:19.354 --> 07:21.648
Is it everything we dreamed
of since we were little?

07:21.732 --> 07:23.567
When I was little, I dreamed of getting

07:23.650 --> 07:25.694
a MacArthur grant for my
'zine about how all the girls

07:25.777 --> 07:27.195
at school were bitches.

07:27.278 --> 07:29.656
- Oh.
- Look, the wedding was great.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.700
But that's not real life.

07:31.783 --> 07:33.326
I mean, I guess I got a happy ending,

07:33.410 --> 07:35.328
but every happy ending has the day after

07:35.412 --> 07:36.580
the happy ending, right?

07:36.663 --> 07:37.789
And the day after that.

07:37.873 --> 07:40.124
So the wedding was so much fun.

07:40.208 --> 07:41.626
It was the happiest day of my life.

07:41.710 --> 07:43.211
But, you know, what does that say

07:43.294 --> 07:45.296
about all the days I have left?

07:45.380 --> 07:46.506
Whoa.

07:46.590 --> 07:49.843
We're such a Zoe.

07:51.386 --> 07:52.721
Oh, Todd, glad you're here.

07:52.804 --> 07:53.805
Hold this.

07:54.431 --> 07:55.682
Todd, my jacket is on the floor.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.058
You're supposed to hold the jacket

07:57.141 --> 07:58.643
so it doesn't go on the floor.

07:58.727 --> 08:01.980
Hey, sorry, BoJack... I
mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.

08:02.063 --> 08:04.441
But I work for Mr. Peanutbutter now.

08:04.524 --> 08:07.360
- I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- Ugh.

08:07.444 --> 08:08.987
I can't believe I'm on
a movie set, you know?

08:09.070 --> 08:11.656
I mean, this is my first
chance to work on something big

08:11.740 --> 08:14.325
since my rock opera fell apart.

08:14.409 --> 08:17.788

Uh...

08:20.164 --> 08:25.462

08:25.545 --> 08:26.546
Yep.

08:26.630 --> 08:27.631

the living room, make a left.

- Can't miss it.
- I'm gonna grab a quick bite.

Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.

08:42.645 --> 08:44.815
Okay, fellas, here's the
thing about the story.

08:44.898 --> 08:46.190
I don't buy it.

08:46.274 --> 08:47.651
It's like something's missing,

08:47.734 --> 08:49.277
but I can't put any of my fingers on it.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.362
Um, maybe once we add the music...

08:51.446 --> 08:52.572
The music? Are you kidding me?

08:52.656 --> 08:53.865
Music? You're fired.

08:53.949 --> 08:55.116
What dumb shit brought this dumb shit?

08:55.199 --> 08:56.200
Okay, you're fired too.

08:56.284 --> 08:57.577
Oh, okay.

08:57.661 --> 09:00.204
Anyone else got any bright ideas?

09:00.288 --> 09:01.581
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

09:01.665 --> 09:04.501
Hey, maybe it make it more Diane-y?

09:04.584 --> 09:06.544
- Um, excuse me?
- I don't know.

09:06.628 --> 09:08.755
This is probably stupid,
but the whole story's

09:08.839 --> 09:11.049
about how this guy's in
love with this lady, right?

09:11.132 --> 09:14.427
But we don't even know who
she is or what she wants.

09:14.511 --> 09:16.888
I mean, maybe give her more lines or words

09:16.972 --> 09:19.223
or, I don't know, feelings or whatever?

09:19.307 --> 09:20.308
What?

09:20.391 --> 09:22.310
He's new. He doesn't know the rules.

09:22.393 --> 09:24.688
Forgive him, mighty Caesar.

09:29.567 --> 09:31.110
Yes. Yeah.

09:31.194 --> 09:32.195
I love you.

09:32.278 --> 09:33.279
Who is this kid?

09:33.363 --> 09:34.614
You're a genius.

09:34.698 --> 09:35.782
- I'm gonna kiss your face.
- What?

09:35.866 --> 09:37.784
Oh! [Laughs]

09:37.868 --> 09:39.202
Come back to my web.

09:39.285 --> 09:40.620
Let's talk about Diane's feelings

09:40.704 --> 09:42.080
and make this baby sing.

09:42.163 --> 09:44.582
Hey, Todd, talk to him about the wardrobe,

09:44.666 --> 09:46.584
specifically the top half of the wardrobe,

09:46.668 --> 09:49.462
specifically the shirt part of
the top half of the wardrobe,

09:49.546 --> 09:52.716
specifically the neck part of
the shirt part of the wardrobe.

09:52.799 --> 09:54.759
[cell phone rings]

09:54.843 --> 09:56.219
Ugh. What now?

09:56.302 --> 09:58.013
I'm sick of this dog and pony show.

09:58.096 --> 09:59.597
The movie is dumb.

09:59.681 --> 10:01.349
Mr. Peanutbutter is
annoying the shit out of me,

10:01.432 --> 10:02.976
and there's too much
honeydew in the fruit bowl.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.644
Blech. Honeydew is garbage fruit.

10:04.728 --> 10:06.855
Also, why is BoJack being
played by an old, nebbishy

10:06.938 --> 10:07.939
five-foot-tall
bald guy?

10:08.023 --> 10:09.357
Is that how the world sees me?

10:09.440 --> 10:10.441
Oh, I see.

10:10.525 --> 10:12.861
So I can play Vanya on 42nd Street,

10:12.944 --> 10:15.864
but I'm not a deft-enough
talent to capture the essence

10:15.947 --> 10:17.949
of the elusive BoJack Horseman.

10:18.033 --> 10:22.037
So sorry to offend you, sir.

10:22.120 --> 10:23.955
I'm just glad my book's coming out soon

10:24.039 --> 10:25.916
so people will get an opportunity to see

10:25.999 --> 10:27.458
the real BoJack Horseman.

10:27.542 --> 10:29.086
Oh, are you coming out with a book?

10:29.168 --> 10:30.378
You never mentioned it.

10:30.461 --> 10:31.629
Plus, Todd's being super weird.

10:31.713 --> 10:32.756
I think he's onto me.

10:32.839 --> 10:33.882
Onto you in regards to what?

10:33.965 --> 10:35.592
Oh, right, I didn't tell you.

10:35.675 --> 10:38.261
I sabotaged his rock opera
by getting him readdicted

10:38.344 --> 10:40.304
to a video game because I
didn't want him to move out.

10:40.388 --> 10:42.057
Jesus Christ, BoJack.

10:42.181 --> 10:44.267
Anyway, I think he knows
and might be plotting

10:44.350 --> 10:45.727
to sabotage me back.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.604
Why is it that 90% of our conversations

10:47.687 --> 10:49.814
these days revolve
around plotting sabotages?

10:49.898 --> 10:51.524
Are you saying I should
plot a countersabotage?

10:51.608 --> 10:53.401
No, no more plotting.

10:53.484 --> 10:55.695
Just be a good soldier and do your job.

10:55.779 --> 10:57.072
Nobody is out to get you.

10:57.155 --> 10:58.156
[cell phone beeps]

10:58.239 --> 10:59.824
Have you seen the new draft?

10:59.908 --> 11:01.910
They took it all off you and put it on me.

11:01.993 --> 11:03.286
What?

11:03.369 --> 11:05.789
Apparently some dickweed named Todd

11:05.872 --> 11:08.083
decided I should be three-dimensional

11:08.166 --> 11:10.001
and you should have no lines.

11:10.085 --> 11:12.045
Ugh. Isn't this town sick of creating

11:12.129 --> 11:14.338
three-dimensional roles for women?

11:14.422 --> 11:16.174
This happens to me all the time!

11:16.257 --> 11:19.302
A.O. Scott is sick of talking
about how brilliant I am.

11:19.385 --> 11:21.471
Todd.

11:21.554 --> 11:23.264
I guess what I've been saying

11:23.347 --> 11:26.267
for the last seven
uninterrupted minutes is,

11:26.350 --> 11:30.271
how can I forgive my father
if I can't forgive myself?

11:30.354 --> 11:31.898
True dat.

11:31.982 --> 11:35.234
But none of that matters,
because we bring out

11:35.318 --> 11:36.987
the best in each other.

11:37.070 --> 11:41.658
I'm the chocolate, and
you're Mr. Peanutbutter!

11:41.741 --> 11:43.827
- True dat.
- Mwah!

11:43.910 --> 11:45.703
Cut! Amazing.

11:45.787 --> 11:47.789
This is the movie that I wanted to make.

11:47.872 --> 11:48.873
This is gonna be great.

11:48.957 --> 11:50.750
- Oh, my God, I'm so...
- Ugh, what kind of idiot

11:50.834 --> 11:53.211
puts food on top of a hill?

11:53.294 --> 11:56.131
Hey, so I guess now that
the movie's all about Diane,

11:56.214 --> 11:59.176
I really need to dig deep
and get to know the real you.

11:59.258 --> 12:02.804
So let's talk and talk
and talk until I am you

12:02.887 --> 12:04.764
and you are nothing
but a hollowed-out husk

12:04.848 --> 12:07.391
of your former self and every
thought and every feeling

12:07.475 --> 12:11.270
you ever had belongs to me and me alone.

12:11.354 --> 12:15.108
So do we like Sprite, or
are we more of a 7-Up girl?

12:15.192 --> 12:17.777
Uh, that all sounds great.

12:17.861 --> 12:20.363
But, you know, the person you
should really be talking to

12:20.446 --> 12:22.115
is that guy.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.367
- Yeah, okay, I'm done.
- Diane loves talking to him.

12:24.450 --> 12:25.952
They have great rapport.

12:26.036 --> 12:29.580
In fact, Diane could spend
all day talking to him

12:29.664 --> 12:32.167
and never talk to me again.

12:32.250 --> 12:36.629
Oh, I get it, because
Diane doesn't talk to Diane.

12:36.713 --> 12:39.757
- Diane talks to...
- Anybody else.

12:39.841 --> 12:41.342
Hey, Todd, remember that time

12:41.425 --> 12:42.969
when you wouldn't clean up your shit?

12:43.053 --> 12:44.428
That was hilarious.

12:44.512 --> 12:46.430
- We've had some good times.
- Oh. Hi.

12:46.514 --> 12:48.266
So I was thinking, I have some...

12:48.391 --> 12:51.228
[sighs] pretty sloppy seconds
left over from P.F. Chang's

12:51.310 --> 12:53.521
in the fridge, and I don't
think that I want it anymore.

12:53.604 --> 12:54.856
Maybe tonight you could eat it.

12:54.939 --> 12:56.482
Friendly gesture because we're friends.

12:56.566 --> 12:58.526
- Uh... - Oh-oh,
there's my guy.

12:58.609 --> 13:00.778
I heard you had a few more
thoughts about the script.

13:00.862 --> 13:01.863
I do.

13:01.946 --> 13:04.615
I was just thinking, what if
we made the BoJack character

13:04.699 --> 13:06.659
into a real shithead?

13:06.743 --> 13:08.870
- Is that really necessary?
- I don't think it's necessary.

13:08.953 --> 13:12.582
Yeah, let's... Let's make
him be a real selfish asshole

13:12.665 --> 13:14.834
so the audience has
someone to root against.

13:14.918 --> 13:16.211
You're probably right.

13:16.294 --> 13:17.503
Let's take another swing at the script

13:17.587 --> 13:19.047
and give BoJack more to do.

13:19.130 --> 13:20.590
Now, when you say, "Give
BoJack more to do"...

13:20.673 --> 13:22.133
Not now, Mr. Peanutbutter.

13:22.217 --> 13:24.094
And also, now that I'm thinking about it,

13:24.177 --> 13:27.889
why does the movie have
to take place on Earth?

13:27.972 --> 13:30.600
You are blowing my head.

13:30.683 --> 13:32.476
- I hope you like Oscars.
- Honeydew?

13:32.560 --> 13:34.604
More like, "Honey, do I enjoy eating it?

13:34.687 --> 13:36.522
Yes, I do." Right?

13:36.606 --> 13:38.608
Not right, and I would love to
go through all the reasons why,

13:38.691 --> 13:40.151
but I've got bigger concerns right now.

13:40.235 --> 13:42.361
- Honeydew, go on.
- Did you notice

13:42.445 --> 13:44.155
that the Mr. Peanutbutter
part has been cut in half?

13:44.239 --> 13:46.866
- What is happening to our movie?
- I thought you hated the movie.

13:46.950 --> 13:48.826
Yeah, I do, but if I'm
gonna be in a dumb movie

13:48.910 --> 13:50.245
I hate that makes no sense,

13:50.328 --> 13:51.996
I should at least be the star of it.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.458
Look, I agree that this
movie has really lost its way.

13:55.541 --> 13:57.877
I mean, first of all,
why would Mr. Peanutbutter

13:57.961 --> 13:59.712
wear a crew neck T-shirt?

13:59.796 --> 14:02.381
And second of all, uh...

14:02.465 --> 14:03.841
It's just the shirt, isn't it?

14:03.925 --> 14:05.093
It doesn't make sense.

14:05.176 --> 14:06.427
I'm a V-neck man.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.221
A V you can put your sunglasses in.

14:08.305 --> 14:09.764
Can you do that with a crew neck?

14:09.847 --> 14:11.599
Because I'd like to see you tr...

14:11.682 --> 14:13.476
Whoa.

14:13.559 --> 14:16.229
[groaning]

14:16.813 --> 14:17.814
Bagel.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.358
Thanks so much for
running this scene with me.

14:20.441 --> 14:22.443
I have so many lines to learn.

14:22.526 --> 14:24.862
Yeah, well, most of my
lines are, "True dat,"

14:24.946 --> 14:26.948
but I guess it never hurts to practice.

14:27.031 --> 14:30.076
The citizens of Planet
D want their king back.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.787
But I'm more concerned with
getting my self-esteem back

14:32.870 --> 14:36.040
after being in the shadow
of powerful men for so long.

14:36.124 --> 14:37.208
True dat.

14:37.292 --> 14:38.542
Is it just me, or is this movie

14:38.626 --> 14:40.211
kind of flying off the rails?

14:40.295 --> 14:42.213
Well, I don't want to
overuse my catchphrase here,

14:42.297 --> 14:43.673
but true dat.

14:43.756 --> 14:45.383
This is so typical.

14:45.508 --> 14:47.802
I just wanted to do something light and fun

14:47.885 --> 14:52.473
to distract me from the deep
well of sadness that is my life.

14:52.556 --> 14:54.309
You probably wouldn't understand.

14:54.392 --> 14:55.768
Oh, puh-lease.

14:55.852 --> 14:57.645
I'm so deep down a well of sadness

14:57.728 --> 15:00.773
that Baby Jessica is like, "Damn."

15:00.857 --> 15:03.484
Shut up and kiss me, you miserable goof.

15:03.567 --> 15:04.861
What?

15:04.944 --> 15:07.905
Oh. Okay. Mwah.

15:07.989 --> 15:09.615
Pop this in a drawer.

15:09.699 --> 15:12.576
Huh?

15:12.660 --> 15:15.330
- [glass shatters]
- This is good, baby.

15:15.413 --> 15:16.873
Oh, this is amazing.

15:16.956 --> 15:18.916
Naomi, I haven't felt like this since...

15:19.000 --> 15:20.084
No, no, shh, shh, shh!

15:20.168 --> 15:22.295
Call me Diane.

15:24.505 --> 15:25.882
Okay, got my bagel.

15:25.965 --> 15:27.466
Now back to work.

15:27.550 --> 15:29.344
Hey, guys.

15:29.427 --> 15:30.845
Hey, guys!

15:33.181 --> 15:34.515
Wow, wow.

15:34.598 --> 15:37.394
So you guys really hit it off, huh?

15:37.476 --> 15:38.895
That's awesome.

15:38.978 --> 15:40.397
Want to do some hand stuff in the bathroom

15:40.479 --> 15:41.480
before we go down to set?

15:41.564 --> 15:42.857
You read my mind.

15:42.940 --> 15:46.444
Now, kiss me some sour cream.

15:46.527 --> 15:48.363
Hey, so I finished the book

15:49.030 --> 15:50.198
and sent the draft to the publishers.

15:50.281 --> 15:51.282
What? My book is ready?

15:51.366 --> 15:52.367
Let me read it. Can I read it?

15:52.450 --> 15:54.411
Call Pinky.

15:54.493 --> 15:56.371
He'll probably send you a copy
as soon as he's done with it.

15:56.454 --> 15:57.997
All right! You hang tight, baby.

15:58.081 --> 15:59.623
I got an instant classic to read.

15:59.707 --> 16:00.708
Keep the engine running, though,

16:00.791 --> 16:02.252
because if I know me,
this book is gonna give me

16:02.335 --> 16:03.544
a pretty big erection.

16:03.627 --> 16:05.380
Okay, enjoy! Keep an open mind.

16:05.463 --> 16:07.090
You'll love it. It's a work in progress.

16:08.549 --> 16:09.926
[telephone rings]

16:10.009 --> 16:11.094
Hello. Penguin Publishing.

16:11.177 --> 16:12.678
Unless this is that loan shark,

16:12.762 --> 16:14.513
in which case, Johnny's House of Noodles.

16:14.597 --> 16:16.224
May I interest you in our bento lunch box?

16:16.515 --> 16:17.808
Pinky, it's me.

16:17.892 --> 16:19.143
Let me read the book.
Give me, give me, give me.

16:19.227 --> 16:21.020
Okay, okay, now, I should warn you,

16:21.104 --> 16:24.607
it's not quite what we
expected, but it is good.

16:24.690 --> 16:26.359
I'm telling you, this could really sell.

16:26.443 --> 16:27.985
I might actually get to see my kids again.

16:28.069 --> 16:29.070
Great. Send it over.

16:29.153 --> 16:30.529
I'll read it right now.

16:30.613 --> 16:32.282
All right, I sent it, but just remember...

16:32.365 --> 16:34.867
To set my expectations sky-high?

16:34.951 --> 16:36.327
- Way ahead of you.
- [cell phone beeps]

16:36.411 --> 16:38.829
All right, book, let's see what you got.

16:38.913 --> 16:41.749
BoJack, this is you.

16:41.832 --> 16:43.376
One Trick Pony?

16:43.460 --> 16:45.211
"The first time I met BoJack Horseman,

16:45.295 --> 16:47.004
he was puking cotton candy off the deck

16:47.088 --> 16:48.756
of his lavish house in the Hills,

16:48.839 --> 16:50.716
the lights of the city twinkling below us.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.593
The Make-A-Wish kids
will not soon forget

16:52.676 --> 16:54.804
the time the great BoJack Horseman

16:54.887 --> 16:58.015
referred to their parents as
'a bunch of used jizz bags.'

16:58.099 --> 17:01.060
He filled the air with
words, terrified of silence,

17:01.144 --> 17:03.396
as one often is who is
smart enough to recognize

17:03.480 --> 17:06.898
his many personal failings
but unwilling or unable

17:06.983 --> 17:08.651
to take the steps required to fix them.

17:08.733 --> 17:11.279
Got out of the car, stepped
out toward the coast,

17:11.362 --> 17:13.114
and looked across the water,

17:13.196 --> 17:16.700
and for a moment, he said nothing."

17:16.784 --> 17:18.786
What the shit was that?

17:19.787 --> 17:21.498
What the shit is this?

17:21.579 --> 17:23.582
It's a phone. Well, a
tiny computer, really.

17:23.665 --> 17:25.126
I mean, amazing what technology can...

17:25.209 --> 17:26.752
You were supposed to ghostwrite my memoir,

17:26.836 --> 17:28.463
but instead you wrote a
story about how you spent

17:28.546 --> 17:31.048
six months with me and saw
what a big, dumb loser I am.

17:31.132 --> 17:33.301
Well, I realized that the best way

17:33.384 --> 17:35.553
to fully capture you, warts and all...

17:35.636 --> 17:37.472
This isn't warts and all. It's just warts.

17:37.555 --> 17:38.515
Where's the all?

17:38.597 --> 17:40.183
I come off like a total asshole.

17:40.266 --> 17:43.060
You come off as complex and deeply troubled

17:43.144 --> 17:44.479
but ultimately sympathetic.

17:44.562 --> 17:46.356
You might be too close to see that.

17:46.439 --> 17:48.899
There's an entire chapter
about me eating apple fritters.

17:48.983 --> 17:50.568
You did go through that fritter phase.

17:50.651 --> 17:51.986
Is this book how you see me?

17:52.069 --> 17:53.446
That day we ran errands together,

17:53.530 --> 17:54.780
I thought that we had a really good time,

17:54.864 --> 17:56.366
but you just wrote about how I cried

17:56.449 --> 17:58.117
because the dry cleaner
took my head shot down.

17:58.201 --> 17:59.618
You were very emotional.

17:59.702 --> 18:01.454
They didn't even replace me with anyone.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.622
Now it's just a faded spot
where my face used to be.

18:03.706 --> 18:05.624
This will actually do
wonders for your career.

18:05.708 --> 18:07.043
Trust me.

18:07.126 --> 18:09.003
I mean, you're just a dumb actor

18:09.086 --> 18:10.629
who doesn't know anything
about books, right?

18:10.713 --> 18:12.549
- [laughs]
- What?

18:12.631 --> 18:13.841
Remember? From before?

18:13.924 --> 18:15.301
Oh, I don't think you understand

18:15.385 --> 18:16.386
what's happening here.

18:16.469 --> 18:18.762
This is not a casual
conversation between friends.

18:18.846 --> 18:21.391
This is your boss telling his employee

18:21.474 --> 18:22.933
that she did a bad job.

18:23.017 --> 18:24.977
- Try again.
- What?

18:25.061 --> 18:26.937
Start over, but do it right this time.

18:27.021 --> 18:29.440
Nobody is ever gonna see this.

18:30.608 --> 18:32.776
- Ugh!
- [cell phone dialing]

18:32.860 --> 18:35.488
- [cell phone vibrating]
- Diane?

18:35.572 --> 18:37.574
Hey, Wayne, you still work for BuzzFeed?

18:37.656 --> 18:38.866
Um, yes.

18:38.949 --> 18:40.368
'Cause I got something that's gonna get you

18:40.451 --> 18:44.080
a shit-ton of hearts or digs or smileys

18:44.163 --> 18:47.291
or whatever the hell you
measure your journalism with.

18:47.375 --> 18:48.959
Curses!

18:49.043 --> 18:51.879
My evil plan has been
defeated, but I'll be back.

18:51.962 --> 18:53.297
You haven't heard the last

18:53.381 --> 18:56.593
of Evil Emperor BoJackitron Horsemaniac.

18:56.717 --> 18:57.718
Oh, no!

18:57.801 --> 18:59.303
You shot a laser at me!

18:59.387 --> 19:01.222
Oh, no! I'm dying.

19:01.305 --> 19:03.641
Oh, no, I'm dead.

19:03.766 --> 19:05.602
And so now that we've escaped

19:05.684 --> 19:08.020
the evil clutches of the emperor,

19:08.104 --> 19:10.773
I'm free to assume my natural form,

19:10.856 --> 19:13.359
an all-knowing floating orb of light?

19:13.443 --> 19:14.485
True dat.

19:14.569 --> 19:16.112
- Cut, cut.
- [buzzer sounds]

19:16.195 --> 19:17.530
Come on, guys, this is ridiculous.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.449
Is this even a movie anymore?

19:19.532 --> 19:22.452
Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.

19:22.535 --> 19:25.079
Yeah, maybe it's an
immersive smartphone app

19:25.162 --> 19:29.917
or a 21st-century approach to
360-degree media envelopment.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.879
Yeah, or maybe it's just,
like, a feeling, you know?

19:33.963 --> 19:35.673
- We've got work to do.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:35.756 --> 19:38.092
- Oh, my God, this is so good.
- Oh, this is gonna be awesome.

19:38.175 --> 19:39.385
Yes! Go, Todd.

19:39.469 --> 19:40.803
Hello?

19:40.886 --> 19:42.179
Are you just gonna leave me like this?

19:42.263 --> 19:43.264
Anyone?

19:43.347 --> 19:45.308
Ah!

19:45.391 --> 19:46.767
Oh, good. You're here.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.227
Oh, hi, BoJack.

19:48.311 --> 19:49.853
This whole day's been a shit show.

19:49.937 --> 19:51.689
The book turned out to
be a total hatchet job.

19:51.772 --> 19:53.190
The movie's a disaster.

19:53.274 --> 19:55.693
But thank God I have one
good thing in my life,

19:55.776 --> 19:56.819
and that's you.

19:56.902 --> 19:58.279
BoJack, I...

19:58.362 --> 20:00.323
Please let me say this
before I lose my nerve.

20:00.406 --> 20:02.450
I spent 50 years roaming the countryside

20:02.533 --> 20:05.077
as a wild stallion, but
I am tired of the rodeo,

20:05.161 --> 20:06.663
and I'm finally ready to saddle up.

20:06.745 --> 20:07.746
BoJack...

20:07.830 --> 20:09.290
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

20:09.373 --> 20:11.584
this mustang wants to rest
his head in the comforts

20:11.668 --> 20:13.043
of your spacious barn.

20:13.127 --> 20:14.337
Uh, what?

20:14.420 --> 20:15.963
I'm in love with you, Naomi.

20:16.046 --> 20:17.298
BoJack, they fired me

20:17.381 --> 20:19.967
and replaced me with a ball on a stick.

20:20.050 --> 20:21.051
I'm so sorry.

20:21.135 --> 20:22.679
But look at the bright side.

20:22.761 --> 20:24.888
Now you and I can just hang
out and talk about feelings.

20:24.972 --> 20:27.558
No, but you're not getting
it. Boys never get it.

20:27.642 --> 20:30.436
BoJack, I was in character as Diane,

20:30.520 --> 20:33.648
and as Diane, we had a real connection.

20:33.731 --> 20:36.275
But now that I'm off the
movie, I'm Naomi again,

20:36.359 --> 20:39.903
and Naomi is not interested
in BoJack Horseman.

20:39.987 --> 20:42.532
In fact, she thinks he's kind of gross.

20:42.615 --> 20:44.950
So I didn't fall in love with Naomi Watts?

20:45.034 --> 20:46.035
No.

20:46.118 --> 20:47.620
You fell in love with Diane.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.122
Naomi what?

20:50.206 --> 20:51.832
Good-bye, BoJack.

20:51.915 --> 20:52.916
Ugh.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.419
See? Nothing.

20:58.839 --> 21:00.341
What's going on? Why are they packing up?

21:00.424 --> 21:02.510
Oh, glad you're here. This is exciting.

21:02.593 --> 21:04.428
Since we last talked,
this film has gone through

21:04.512 --> 21:06.430
- so many permutations.
- So many.

21:06.514 --> 21:08.140
First, we reimagined the whole film

21:08.224 --> 21:10.727
as an interactive social-media experience.

21:10.809 --> 21:12.311
Those are the dumbest
words I've ever heard.

21:12.395 --> 21:13.396
I know.

21:13.479 --> 21:15.314
So we realized it was actually

21:15.398 --> 21:17.066
more of a floating art installation,

21:17.149 --> 21:18.735
but that didn't feel right either.

21:18.817 --> 21:20.361
We thought, is it a high-end perfume?

21:20.444 --> 21:22.279
A series of interrelated fortune cookies?

21:22.363 --> 21:25.282
A hat that if you turn it
upside down, it's a boat?

21:25.366 --> 21:27.785
- No, it's none of those things.
- Exactly.

21:27.868 --> 21:29.912
That's why we finally settled on this.

21:29.995 --> 21:30.996
Voilà!

21:31.080 --> 21:32.498
What am I looking at?

21:32.582 --> 21:35.752
[Todd] It is a bimonthly
curated box of snacks.

21:35.834 --> 21:36.960
I don't know what that means.

21:37.044 --> 21:38.546
I know. It's confusing.

21:38.629 --> 21:40.297
Not the bimonthly that means twice a month,

21:40.381 --> 21:42.800
the bimonthly that means every other month,

21:42.883 --> 21:45.678
and each time it's a
different box of snacks.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.971
This is the future of cinema.

21:48.055 --> 21:52.059
You guys, finally, my story has been told.

21:52.142 --> 21:54.937
Okay, that's a wrap,
everyone. [claps hands]

21:55.020 --> 21:57.940
Thanks for making this
box of snacks a reality.

21:58.023 --> 21:59.024
Let's go home.

22:00.943 --> 22:03.738
What the hell happened to the movie?

22:03.821 --> 22:07.283
Shit, there were snacks
here the whole time?

22:07.366 --> 22:08.409
Not bad.

22:08.492 --> 22:10.035
- Whoa!
- Look, I get it.

22:10.119 --> 22:11.704
You destroyed my big chance at a comeback

22:11.788 --> 22:13.623
as revenge for what I
did to your rock opera.

22:13.706 --> 22:17.293
Revenge? Oh, that would
have been such a good idea.

22:17.376 --> 22:18.586
Damn it, Todd!

22:18.669 --> 22:20.546
Look, I figured out what you did,

22:20.630 --> 22:23.257
but I've been trying to put
it behind me and do my job.

22:23.340 --> 22:26.218
So cutting my part down
was not about revenge?

22:26.343 --> 22:27.344
No.

22:27.428 --> 22:29.221
And making BoJack the villain of your movie

22:29.305 --> 22:31.890
was not a coded statement
of your feelings about me?

22:31.974 --> 22:32.975
No.

22:33.058 --> 22:34.769
Oh, okay, great.

22:34.852 --> 22:37.062
Well, I'm... I'm glad we buried the hatchet

22:37.146 --> 22:38.147
and everything's cool.

22:38.230 --> 22:41.818
Uh, actually, you know,
everything is not cool.

22:41.900 --> 22:44.361
You ruined my rock opera
by using character actress

22:44.445 --> 22:45.904
Margo Martindale to trick me

22:45.988 --> 22:47.615
into playing an addictive video game.

22:47.698 --> 22:49.533
And saying it all together like that,

22:49.617 --> 22:51.201
it all sounds kind of ludicrous.

22:51.285 --> 22:54.037
But still, it was something I cared about,

22:54.121 --> 22:56.540
and what you did really hurt me.

22:56.624 --> 22:58.793
Oh. Well, this feels shitty.

22:58.876 --> 23:01.462
You sure you don't want to just
get some revenge real quick...

23:01.545 --> 23:03.547
thump me once in the stones
and then we'll be even?

23:03.673 --> 23:04.923
I got to go.

23:05.007 --> 23:09.094
I've got some artisanal popcorns
to gauge the mouthfeel of.

23:09.219 --> 23:10.847
- Hey, BoJack.
- Yeah?

23:10.929 --> 23:12.181
You want an apple fritter?

23:12.264 --> 23:13.850
Uh, sure.

23:13.932 --> 23:15.518
- Yeah, I bet you would.
- [laughter]

23:15.601 --> 23:17.102
I bet you'd like an apple fritter.

23:17.186 --> 23:19.104
Yeah, an apple fritter would be great.

23:19.188 --> 23:21.565
Why? What... What... What's happening here?

23:21.649 --> 23:24.151
"Five Shocking Facts From New BoJack Book"?

23:24.234 --> 23:25.695
No. No!

23:25.778 --> 23:28.405
Um, everyone, please
turn off your Internet.

23:28.489 --> 23:29.866
It has gone bad.

23:29.948 --> 23:32.618
I repeat, the Internet has gone foul.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.620
- What a loser.
- I'm glad I'm not that guy.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.205
Give me your phones. I'm a celebrity.

23:36.288 --> 23:37.498
You have to listen to me.

23:37.581 --> 23:39.291
Look at his deep well of sadness.

23:39.375 --> 23:41.251
It's hilarious.

23:41.335 --> 23:43.587
Don't look at me. I'm well-adjusted.

23:43.671 --> 23:45.882
- You all want my life.
- [laughter]

23:45.964 --> 23:47.424
Uh, what the hell?

23:47.508 --> 23:49.134
I know, I know. But if
you just listen for...

23:49.218 --> 23:50.720
You posted your dumb
little book on the Internet.

23:50.803 --> 23:52.638
No, I just leaked the
first couple chapters,

23:52.722 --> 23:54.348
and people are already talking about it.

23:54.473 --> 23:57.518
This is wildly unprofessional.
Who do you think you are?

23:57.601 --> 23:59.478
I know you're mad, and
you have every right to be,

23:59.562 --> 24:01.104
but you got to read some of these comments.

24:01.188 --> 24:02.565
People love you.

24:02.648 --> 24:03.816
And they're gonna love you even more

24:03.900 --> 24:05.776
when they read the rest of my book.

24:05.860 --> 24:07.570
- Your book?
- Our book.

24:07.653 --> 24:09.321
Nobody is gonna read that book.

24:09.405 --> 24:10.573
How do you still not get that?

24:10.656 --> 24:12.742
It is never going to be published.

24:12.825 --> 24:15.118
BoJack, I stand by my work.

24:15.202 --> 24:16.954
This is a really good book.

24:17.037 --> 24:20.290
And if you just give it time, you'll see.

24:20.374 --> 24:22.084
[sighs]

24:22.167 --> 24:23.460
Maybe you're right.

24:23.544 --> 24:24.754
Really?

24:24.837 --> 24:26.589
