00:16.853 --> 00:18.206
Carlton.

00:19.373 --> 00:21.523
Man, you ever feel like
you was being watched?

00:21.693 --> 00:25.766
All the time. When you look this good,
you have to get used to it.

00:27.413 --> 00:30.211
When you talk that stupid,
you have to get used to this, man:

00:30.373 --> 00:33.763
What is wrong with you?
Come here. Come here.

00:35.773 --> 00:37.411
See that dude over there?

00:37.573 --> 00:40.167
He been scoping me since he got here.
I think he's a cop.

00:40.333 --> 00:43.291
Turn yourself in, Will.
It's the only way.

00:44.613 --> 00:46.888
You're right. You're right.

00:49.453 --> 00:52.013
Wait a minute, man.
I ain't do nothing.

00:55.893 --> 00:58.965
Hey, what's up, man?
Can I get you something?

00:59.133 --> 01:00.930
No, I'm fine, son.

01:04.492 --> 01:06.484
If you need...

01:11.253 --> 01:12.971
So is he a cop?

01:13.613 --> 01:14.841
He's my father.

02:25.333 --> 02:26.766
Will.

02:27.733 --> 02:29.564
You don't remember me.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.246
- But...
- Yeah, I do.

02:31.413 --> 02:32.528
Hey, what's up?

02:33.733 --> 02:37.009
- Long time, huh?
- Fourteen years.

02:37.213 --> 02:38.851
Uncle Lou, it's me, Carlton.

02:39.013 --> 02:41.288
- Did you bring me anything?
- Carlton?

02:41.613 --> 02:45.208
My goodness, haven't seen you
since you were 3 years old.

02:45.413 --> 02:47.847
I guess we all have
a lot of catching up to do.

02:48.013 --> 02:49.412
Let's see, where do I begin?

02:49.573 --> 02:51.962
Well, when I was 6,
we all moved from the hood...

02:54.373 --> 02:57.922
And here I am today. Excuse me.

03:02.773 --> 03:05.446
Hey, you want
some more coffee or something?

03:05.613 --> 03:07.444
That would be nice.

03:12.813 --> 03:15.088
When did you get so tall?

03:15.413 --> 03:17.608
Mostly during the '80s.

03:18.253 --> 03:19.652
Thanks.

03:21.213 --> 03:22.441
So how'd you find me?

03:22.613 --> 03:24.092
Well, I...

03:24.413 --> 03:26.244
I talked to your mother
three months ago.

03:26.413 --> 03:29.086
I guess she didn't mention it to you.
Yeah.

03:29.293 --> 03:33.411
Well, anyway, I was driving
through L.A. On business...

03:33.573 --> 03:36.724
I'm a trucker now.
Got my own rig and everything.

03:36.893 --> 03:39.407
So I thought I'd stop by
and see how my boy was doing.

03:40.253 --> 03:42.005
Hey, I'm doing fine.

03:42.173 --> 03:45.131
I'm busy, though. I got a lot of work
and stuff I need to do.

03:45.293 --> 03:47.648
I understand, I understand.

03:49.573 --> 03:51.165
- You take care of yourself.
- Yeah.

03:51.533 --> 03:53.205
You too, all right?

03:58.293 --> 04:00.488
Whoa, hold up.

04:02.133 --> 04:04.931
Hey, you wanna stop by the crib later
and have some dinner?

04:05.333 --> 04:09.406
Oh, well, I know you're living
with Philip and Vivian.

04:09.573 --> 04:11.689
I don't think I'd be too welcome.

04:11.893 --> 04:13.884
You know what I'm saying?

04:14.293 --> 04:17.285
No, they'll be cool.
So look, I get off at 6.

04:17.452 --> 04:19.762
It's great. I'll pick you up then, son.

04:19.933 --> 04:22.288
Okay. Okay.

04:24.893 --> 04:27.282
Good to see you again, Uncle Lou.

04:30.133 --> 04:35.048
Wow, 14 years. You must feel like
you're on a roller coaster of emotions.

04:36.173 --> 04:38.562
Hey, man, that ain't no big thing.

04:38.733 --> 04:40.371
Sure.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.763
Look, I'm here for you, my brother.

04:44.293 --> 04:45.772
Let me hold you.

04:51.653 --> 04:53.006
Hey, Aunt Viv.

04:53.173 --> 04:56.768
Hi, Will. Hi, Lou. My God.

04:56.933 --> 04:58.366
Vivian.

04:58.893 --> 05:00.724
After all these years.

05:00.933 --> 05:04.005
Still a stone cold fox.

05:04.173 --> 05:07.848
Will, you should have told me.
You really should have told me.

05:08.013 --> 05:09.446
I asked Geoffrey to tell you.

05:10.053 --> 05:13.409
I thought it might
be more fun this way.

05:14.093 --> 05:16.402
And I was right.

05:17.493 --> 05:20.166
G, I'd like you to meet...

05:21.613 --> 05:23.251
Lou Smith.

05:23.573 --> 05:27.009
Show Lou to the family room, please,
while Will helps me here with...

05:27.173 --> 05:29.528
...something.
- This way, sir.

05:30.053 --> 05:31.486
How are you doing?

05:31.653 --> 05:33.450
No, I'm cool, Aunt Viv.

05:33.933 --> 05:36.049
I stopped on the way home.
I had a few drinks.

05:36.213 --> 05:39.091
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

05:39.253 --> 05:41.926
You think that Uncle Phil
is gonna be cool with this?

05:42.133 --> 05:44.488
- I think so. Yeah.
- All right.

05:44.653 --> 05:47.087
If I can stop him from coming home.

05:49.093 --> 05:51.448
Who is this beautiful woman?

05:52.333 --> 05:54.403
She's Hilary.

05:59.573 --> 06:02.326
- Hilary, this is...
- I'm Will's father.

06:02.493 --> 06:04.609
Oh, come on.

06:05.213 --> 06:08.922
Will's father is a deadbeat
who left him and his mom flat.

06:09.533 --> 06:12.730
- Hello.
- Uncle Lou!

06:14.853 --> 06:18.289
Well, let's just sit down
and have a nice, quick visit.

06:18.453 --> 06:21.206
- Vivian.
- Oh, that was fun.

06:21.893 --> 06:23.884
Why is there a truck parked in my...?

06:26.213 --> 06:27.612
What are you doing here?

06:28.453 --> 06:31.763
Philip, can I see you
in the kitchen, please?

06:37.333 --> 06:40.006
- I should go.
- Don't be silly.

06:40.173 --> 06:43.085
Who knows if we'd ever
see you again? Come on.

06:45.213 --> 06:50.765
I must be an old man,
because little Ashley's all grown up.

06:50.933 --> 06:52.446
Yeah, Ashley...

06:52.653 --> 06:54.689
...this is your Uncle Lou.

06:54.853 --> 06:56.411
Uncle Lou?

06:56.573 --> 07:00.612
- You mean he's your...
- Yeah, that's right. He's my Lou.

07:00.773 --> 07:03.367
And this must be little Nicky.

07:03.533 --> 07:05.888
- May I?
- Sure.

07:07.133 --> 07:09.408
Oh, yes, yes.

07:09.573 --> 07:12.451
You know, Will,
I used to hold you just like this.

07:12.653 --> 07:15.247
Then why'd you run out on him?

07:17.693 --> 07:20.730
Well, Lou. It's been a while.

07:20.893 --> 07:22.326
How long are you in town for?

07:22.493 --> 07:25.246
A couple of days. On some business.

07:25.413 --> 07:27.973
Yeah, Uncle Phil, he owns
his own trucking company now.

07:28.133 --> 07:30.044
Well, one truck.

07:30.213 --> 07:33.171
But I am my own boss.
And I'm making a little money.

07:33.333 --> 07:36.325
Why didn't you send any back
to the wife and child you abandoned?

07:36.533 --> 07:38.763
- Hey, Uncle Phil, man.
- You promised.

07:38.933 --> 07:41.925
Look, if you'll excuse me,
I think I'll skip dinner.

07:42.093 --> 07:44.527
I don't have much of an appetite.

07:44.733 --> 07:47.088
Shall I call 911?

07:55.613 --> 07:58.730
I ain't scared
of no kiddie roller coaster ride.

07:58.933 --> 08:00.969
Please, you was up there
screaming so loud...

08:01.133 --> 08:03.886
...I thought I was sitting
next to Patti LaBelle.

08:14.933 --> 08:16.844
Will, I owe you an explanation.

08:17.013 --> 08:18.844
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

08:19.013 --> 08:20.446
You see...

08:20.813 --> 08:24.772
...the day you were born
was the happiest day of my life.

08:24.973 --> 08:26.929
The first time I held you...

08:27.093 --> 08:29.004
...I didn't think
I'd ever put you down.

08:29.293 --> 08:30.567
So why did you?

08:33.173 --> 08:35.482
I just wasn't ready to be a father.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.928
I started feeling trapped.

08:38.293 --> 08:43.048
Well, one day I just panicked and ran.

08:44.013 --> 08:47.050
It was selfish and cowardly...

08:47.213 --> 08:49.090
...but that's what I did.

08:51.253 --> 08:54.290
- I'm sorry.
- Look, why are you telling me this now?

08:54.453 --> 08:56.603
Because you're my son and I love you.

08:57.613 --> 08:59.922
And I'm a different man now.

09:00.413 --> 09:03.211
I'm ready to be part of your life,
if you'll let me.

09:03.733 --> 09:05.610
- Part of my life. How?
- Yeah.

09:06.173 --> 09:08.971
Well, for one,
we can get to know one another.

09:09.333 --> 09:12.484
And did you know your old man
was All City point guard?

09:13.293 --> 09:14.965
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

09:15.133 --> 09:18.603
I still hold the record
for the most consecutive foul shots.

09:20.773 --> 09:22.809
- You don't believe me?
- I didn't say nothing.

09:22.973 --> 09:24.645
No, I see you don't believe me.

09:24.813 --> 09:26.610
Hey, come here. Come here.

09:26.773 --> 09:29.333
Don't let this height fool you,
you hear?

09:30.853 --> 09:33.572
- I didn't say nothing.
- No, you didn't have to say nothing.

09:33.733 --> 09:37.362
Don't hurt yourself now.
I don't want to take you back broke.

09:39.293 --> 09:41.011
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:41.173 --> 09:44.688
Anybody can make one. They have
little girls out here that can make one.

09:45.573 --> 09:49.566
- Yeah.
- Well, two ain't nothing either.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.928
He's really good.

09:54.573 --> 09:56.370
He's my dad.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.924
- Yeah.
- He's good.

10:01.093 --> 10:02.924
All right, give me that ball.

10:03.613 --> 10:06.810
Listen, Vy, I told you last night,
we're keeping a close eye on Will.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.611
He's doing fine.

10:08.773 --> 10:10.331
Everything is...

10:10.533 --> 10:11.807
What?

10:11.973 --> 10:14.168
Yeah, Lou still looks great.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.972
Hey, I'm sorry. He does.

10:17.173 --> 10:21.610
Okay, fine. He's puffed up
like a blowfish and bald as an egg.

10:21.773 --> 10:24.571
Were your ears burning, sir?

10:26.813 --> 10:29.407
- We're back.
- I have to go. Bye-bye.

10:30.173 --> 10:31.925
Did you have a good time?

10:32.093 --> 10:34.561
We rode every roller coaster
in the park.

10:34.733 --> 10:36.769
Yeah, almost threw up
like three times.

10:36.933 --> 10:38.651
That's my boy.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.288
I'm glad you two
got to spend some time together.

10:41.453 --> 10:43.250
We just getting started, right, Daddy?

10:43.413 --> 10:45.085
- Yep.
- What do you mean?

10:45.553 --> 10:48.704
My dad has to hit the road tomorrow.
And I'm gonna go with him.

10:48.873 --> 10:51.341
Why should I spend my summer
wasting at the Peacock...

10:51.513 --> 10:53.310
...when I can hit the road
with my dad?

10:53.473 --> 10:55.350
Hey, watch yourself, watch yourself.

10:55.953 --> 10:58.308
It's a great way
for Will to see the country.

10:58.473 --> 11:00.703
- Forget it.
- Come on, Phil.

11:00.913 --> 11:02.710
The boy could use a little adventure.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.632
Excuse me,
but this is a family discussion.

11:05.793 --> 11:07.624
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.704
It's okay. It's okay.

11:12.033 --> 11:14.149
I'll wait in the pool house.

11:18.433 --> 11:21.903
Uncle Phil, that is not cool,
the way you dissing my father like that.

11:22.073 --> 11:23.586
The hell with your father.

11:23.753 --> 11:26.711
- Philip, for God's sake.
- He waltzes in here after 15 years?

11:26.873 --> 11:29.945
- Fourteen.
- Excuse me, 14 years.

11:30.113 --> 11:32.991
And acts like nothing has happened.
Wake up, Will.

11:33.153 --> 11:37.431
This is the same guy who didn't think
enough of you to pick up the phone.

11:38.833 --> 11:41.427
He made a mistake.

11:41.593 --> 11:44.983
I'm sorry that everybody can't be
as perfect as you, Uncle Phil.

11:45.193 --> 11:47.229
But if I can forgive him,
how come you can't?

11:47.393 --> 11:49.668
Because he's doing this for himself.

11:49.833 --> 11:52.142
If you think any differently,
then you're a fool.

11:52.313 --> 11:54.224
Hey, just cool it.

11:54.433 --> 11:57.630
Just cool down.
We can talk about this another time.

11:57.793 --> 11:59.226
You know what, Aunt Viv...

11:59.633 --> 12:01.510
...ain't even nothing to talk about.

12:01.673 --> 12:04.426
I've been waiting for this
for a long time, my whole life...

12:04.633 --> 12:07.705
...and ain't nobody gonna stop me.
Come tomorrow, I'm out of here.

12:07.873 --> 12:09.909
- I don't think so.
- Who cares what you think?

12:10.073 --> 12:11.552
You are not my father!

12:27.313 --> 12:29.031
You know, sir...

12:29.193 --> 12:31.423
...whenever I'm feeling blue...

12:31.593 --> 12:37.270
...I think of the poem my dear mum
used to recite to me as a lad.

12:37.633 --> 12:40.545
<i>The master lives a life of ease</i>

12:40.753 --> 12:44.541
<i>While we live life upon our knees</i>

12:44.713 --> 12:47.546
<i>Waste not your tears
And save your breath</i>

12:47.753 --> 12:52.463
<i>For soon he'll die a violent death</i>

12:53.793 --> 12:55.351
Works for me.

12:57.473 --> 13:01.671
Daddy, I had a little accident
at the mall. I'm okay.

13:02.473 --> 13:05.146
But I totaled your MasterCard.

13:06.793 --> 13:09.068
That's okay, honey.
Everybody makes mistakes.

13:10.473 --> 13:13.271
Here, pick a card.

13:14.673 --> 13:18.905
Well, I'll just take
this pretty gold one.

13:20.313 --> 13:22.110
Thanks, Daddy.

13:22.993 --> 13:24.472
- What's with him?
- I don't know.

13:24.633 --> 13:27.943
He's like a genie on Valium.
Make a wish, hurry.

13:29.393 --> 13:33.625
Daddy, there's a dance next Friday,
but it's not over till midnight.

13:33.793 --> 13:35.943
That's okay, stay out
as late as you wish.

13:36.113 --> 13:37.546
Really?

13:37.753 --> 13:41.189
- Well, then, can l...?
- Hey, save some for me.

13:43.793 --> 13:46.261
- Say, big guy...
- Carlton...

13:46.513 --> 13:48.185
...am I a good father?

13:48.353 --> 13:51.789
- Are you kidding? You're the best.
- Oh, thank you, son.

13:51.953 --> 13:54.262
- Can I have access to my trust fund?
- Not a chance.

13:54.433 --> 13:56.230
I hate you!

13:56.593 --> 13:58.504
Oh, yeah? Well, take a number.

14:02.033 --> 14:04.991
Here comes Mr. Sunshine.

14:05.153 --> 14:07.030
Shut up, Geoffrey.

14:07.393 --> 14:09.349
Philip, stop moping.

14:09.513 --> 14:11.265
You know Will
didn't mean what he said.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.548
Well, why'd he say it?

14:12.753 --> 14:15.426
For four years, I treated that boy
like my own son.

14:15.593 --> 14:19.666
Whether he needed a pat on the head or
a kick in the pants, I was there for him.

14:19.953 --> 14:22.387
I worked my ass off
trying to keep him in line.

14:22.553 --> 14:25.989
And yet, it's come back
with a vengeance.

14:31.673 --> 14:34.141
I have done everything for Will.

14:34.313 --> 14:37.146
Suddenly, it's like
none of that matters.

14:37.473 --> 14:39.589
I can't believe he could be so selfish.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.744
Philip, listen to yourself.

14:41.913 --> 14:45.747
Somebody's being selfish all right,
but it isn't Will.

14:49.273 --> 14:52.390
Will, do you mind if I move
your things around while you're gone?

14:52.553 --> 14:54.987
No, it's cool. Knock yourself out, man.

15:01.953 --> 15:04.421
You know, Carlton,
up until a few days ago...

15:04.593 --> 15:07.232
...I never even thought
I'd see my father again.

15:07.473 --> 15:11.466
It was like I couldn't even think about it
because I knew it wasn't gonna happen.

15:11.753 --> 15:14.984
But I still managed
to keep the fantasy.

15:15.513 --> 15:17.026
Now it's real.

15:17.193 --> 15:18.831
I can't believe how lucky I am.

15:18.993 --> 15:20.824
Yeah, it's a miracle.

15:21.033 --> 15:22.910
Hold the tape measure.

15:24.593 --> 15:27.585
Carlton, I'm only going
for the summer, man.

15:28.913 --> 15:30.187
Hi.

15:30.353 --> 15:31.991
Can I speak to Will alone, please?

15:33.113 --> 15:34.865
You're not gonna talk him
into staying?

15:35.033 --> 15:36.944
- Get out.
- Right.

15:38.753 --> 15:40.027
Look...

15:40.193 --> 15:41.911
...Uncle Phil, I owe you an apology.

15:42.073 --> 15:45.622
No, no, no, I'm the one. I'm sorry.

15:46.593 --> 15:49.027
I guess we both said
some things we didn't mean.

15:49.193 --> 15:51.149
No, I meant what I said.

15:51.313 --> 15:52.985
I was just out of line.

15:53.793 --> 15:58.230
Uncle Phil, man, you know I appreciate
everything you've done for me.

15:58.393 --> 16:01.226
But this ain't about you.
This is something I gotta do for me.

16:01.393 --> 16:04.146
Yeah, I know. I know, son. And...

16:06.593 --> 16:08.629
I wish you the best.

16:09.353 --> 16:11.821
Good luck. I'll miss you.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.025
Me too, man.

16:21.033 --> 16:22.546
Hey, Uncle Phil.

16:23.033 --> 16:26.309
I mean, you know
that this is just for the summer, right?

16:34.033 --> 16:36.308
Where's Lou?
He's supposed to be here an hour ago.

16:36.473 --> 16:37.792
I knew this was gonna happen.

16:37.953 --> 16:41.343
- Maybe he got stuck in traffic.
- Yeah, on his way out of town.

16:41.553 --> 16:44.351
- Mr. Smith has arrived.
- Sorry, I'm late.

16:45.153 --> 16:49.146
Business. I talked to this guy
who's got this shipment.

16:49.353 --> 16:54.347
Gotta go from L.A. To Maine
in 72 hours if I can make it.

16:54.553 --> 16:57.351
And I can make it
because I am the best.

16:58.913 --> 17:01.302
- And I'll make myself a quick five grand.
- Yeah.

17:01.473 --> 17:03.862
That's terrific.
You and Will better get a move on.

17:04.193 --> 17:06.229
Well, now, that's the problem.

17:06.512 --> 17:09.266
As good as I am,
I can't make the deadline by myself.

17:09.433 --> 17:11.310
So I'm gonna pick up
an extra driver.

17:12.633 --> 17:16.228
So there won't be any room for Will.

17:16.792 --> 17:20.183
- Not this trip, no.
- But, you know, I'll tell you what, Lou.

17:20.353 --> 17:22.423
I'll buy Will a plane ticket to Maine...

17:22.633 --> 17:25.590
...and that way you could hook up
and have the summer together.

17:25.752 --> 17:28.790
That's mighty generous
of you, Philip...

17:28.953 --> 17:32.070
...but this job could lead
to another big one...

17:32.233 --> 17:34.793
...and I gotta stay flexible,
you know what I'm saying?

17:34.993 --> 17:37.587
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

17:37.753 --> 17:39.072
Will is gonna be crushed.

17:39.353 --> 17:40.786
Yeah.

17:41.393 --> 17:45.227
That's why I was thinking maybe
you two should break the news to him.

17:48.993 --> 17:51.427
Vivian, would you take Nicky
upstairs, please?

17:53.393 --> 17:55.509
You're not gonna hit him, are you?

17:55.713 --> 17:57.783
Because I don't wanna miss that.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.383
No, I'm not gonna hit him.

18:06.333 --> 18:09.769
Lou, if you walk out
of Will's life now...

18:09.933 --> 18:12.527
...don't you ever come back.

18:15.933 --> 18:18.242
- Sit down.
- I ain't got time for no lecture.

18:18.413 --> 18:20.131
I said, sit down, Lou.

18:29.733 --> 18:33.646
You know, Will was doing just fine
till you showed up.

18:34.373 --> 18:38.127
But now that you're back,
you have responsibilities to him.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.608
- Look, we're still gonna take the trip.
- Oh, bull!

18:41.133 --> 18:42.771
Bull.

18:43.133 --> 18:45.522
Will is not a coat
that you hang in the closet...

18:45.693 --> 18:47.888
...then pick it up
when you're ready to wear it.

18:48.053 --> 18:51.125
His life goes on.
He's not supposed to be here for you.

18:51.293 --> 18:54.091
- You're supposed to be here for him.
- You get off my back!

18:54.253 --> 18:57.848
You think I want this?
It just happened.

18:58.973 --> 19:01.043
Now, when Will was a baby,
I was scared...

19:01.213 --> 19:03.363
Cut the crap, all right? Cut it.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.012
Because I've been there.

19:05.173 --> 19:08.609
But I didn't run out on my family.
I was there every day for them.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.331
Because that's what a man does.

19:10.493 --> 19:12.404
Fine, Philip.

19:12.973 --> 19:15.487
You win. You the man.

19:15.653 --> 19:17.132
You a better man than me.

19:18.933 --> 19:20.491
You happy?

19:21.853 --> 19:24.287
Now you gonna tell Will or not?

19:24.453 --> 19:26.523
I'm not gonna do
your dirty work for you.

19:27.053 --> 19:28.406
Fine.

19:28.813 --> 19:30.326
- I'll call him.
- Yeah, do that.

19:30.493 --> 19:32.723
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- Daddy-O.

19:33.813 --> 19:34.962
What's up?

19:37.333 --> 19:38.812
Will.

19:38.973 --> 19:41.009
Man, I'm glad you're here.

19:42.133 --> 19:44.203
Some business came up
I gotta handle.

19:44.413 --> 19:48.565
So we're gonna have
to put our trip on hold.

19:49.093 --> 19:50.811
You understand?

19:51.293 --> 19:53.124
Yeah, that's cool.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.682
- Just for a couple of weeks.
- I understand.

19:56.453 --> 19:59.650
- Maybe a little longer.
- Yeah, whatever. Whatever.

20:00.653 --> 20:04.043
Look, I'll call you next week
and we'll iron out the details.

20:04.213 --> 20:06.283
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:07.573 --> 20:09.484
It was great seeing you, son.

20:10.813 --> 20:13.646
You too, Lou.

20:19.373 --> 20:20.772
Yeah.

20:21.453 --> 20:22.852
Yeah.

20:28.613 --> 20:32.003
- I'm sorry, Will.
- Actually, this works out better for me.

20:32.173 --> 20:35.210
The slimmies this summer
come to class wearing next to nothing.

20:35.373 --> 20:38.809
- Will, it's all right to be angry.
- Hey, why should I be mad?

20:38.973 --> 20:40.850
At least he said goodbye this time.

20:41.453 --> 20:45.890
I just wish I hadn't wasted my money
buying this stupid present.

20:47.693 --> 20:50.253
I'm sorry.
If there was something that l...

20:50.453 --> 20:52.967
You know what, you ain't got to do
nothing, Uncle Phil.

20:53.133 --> 20:54.885
It ain't like I'm still 5 years old.

20:55.093 --> 20:57.653
Ain't like I'll be sitting up
every night asking my mom:

20:57.813 --> 20:59.963
"When's Daddy coming home?"
Who needs him?

21:00.173 --> 21:03.529
He wasn't there to teach me how
to shoot my first basket, but I learned.

21:03.693 --> 21:05.490
- And I got pretty good at it too.
- Yeah.

21:05.653 --> 21:08.645
Got through my first date without him.
I learned how to drive.

21:08.813 --> 21:10.804
I learned how to shave.
How to fight.

21:10.973 --> 21:13.851
I had 14 great birthdays without him.

21:14.013 --> 21:18.052
He never even sent me a damn card.
To hell with him!

21:23.053 --> 21:25.248
I didn't need him then
and I don't need him now.

21:25.413 --> 21:27.131
- Will...
- You know what, Uncle Phil?

21:27.293 --> 21:29.204
I'm gonna get through college
without him.

21:29.373 --> 21:30.931
I'll get a great job without him.

21:31.133 --> 21:33.647
I'll marry a beautiful honey,
have a bunch of kids...

21:33.813 --> 21:35.769
...and be a better father
than he ever was.

21:35.933 --> 21:38.527
I don't need him for that,
because there ain't a thing...

21:38.733 --> 21:41.611
...he could ever teach me
about how to love my kids.

21:49.093 --> 21:51.687
How come he don't want me, man?
