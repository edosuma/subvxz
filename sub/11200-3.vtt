00:01.902 --> 00:04.894
NARRATOR: Previously, on Stargate SG-1.

00:05.072 --> 00:07.370
These bracelets link us together.

00:07.474 --> 00:11.001
It says that the Alterans
named their new home Avalon

00:11.111 --> 00:13.545
and that they built many Astria Porta.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.081
-Stargates.
-The Ancients built the stargates.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.981
Well, it stands to reason that
they weren't always called the Ancients.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.884
These stones are actually an Ancient form
of communication device

00:21.988 --> 00:25.014
that links the users psychically, allowing
them to see through each other's eyes.

00:25.125 --> 00:27.593
-Where are we?
-I don't know.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.755
But I think we're in them.

00:29.996 --> 00:31.964
It's possible
it was meant to work this way

00:32.065 --> 00:33.623
so that we can communicate with others

00:33.734 --> 00:36.032
without intruding on the minds
of those we're connected to.

00:36.136 --> 00:38.661
They're just temporary transmitters.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.706
VALA: Not quite what I imagined

00:40.807 --> 00:43.935
when I pictured a civilization
of gate builders.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.739
You're not allowed to investigate
your own history?

00:45.846 --> 00:47.404
If such a history contradicts
The Book of Origin.

00:47.514 --> 00:48.538
You're heretics.

00:48.648 --> 00:50.741
What if these gods, the Ori,

00:51.551 --> 00:54.247
are the people left behind by the Alterans?

00:54.354 --> 00:55.378
You think they ascended?

00:55.555 --> 00:56.715
What are you gonna do?

00:56.823 --> 00:58.347
We're gathering as much evidence
as we can.

00:58.458 --> 01:01.154
We keep hidden those artifacts
which prove our claims

01:01.261 --> 01:02.728
in case one or more of us are discovered.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.700
-Daniel!
-You're killing an innocent person!

01:07.801 --> 01:08.995
(VALA SCREAMING)

01:09.102 --> 01:10.569
She's in V-fib. Code blue.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.008
You will come with me.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.893
-Where are we?
-The Plains of Celestis.

01:37.664 --> 01:38.995
And that?

01:39.900 --> 01:42.095
City of the Gods.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.179
JACKSON: Maybe you could tell me
who you are.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.505
I am a Prior of the Ori.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.339
And what is that?

01:57.751 --> 02:01.812
In time. All in due time.

02:24.611 --> 02:28.707
I guess we'll just wait here.
Is that what we're gonna do?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.717
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

02:33.086 --> 02:35.486
(ELECTRICITY SURGING)

03:02.782 --> 03:04.909
Hallowed are the Ori.

04:11.117 --> 04:14.052
LAM: Both Daniel and Vala 's vitals
have been stable for two hours now.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.216
What about disconnecting them
from the device?

04:16.323 --> 04:18.723
Dr. Lee has been unable
to remove the stones.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.355
We haven't tried C-4 yet, sir.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.952
Dr. Lee is working
on disabling the power source,

04:24.064 --> 04:26.464
but given that the device
is tied directly into their minds,

04:26.566 --> 04:30.332
-I recommend we proceed with caution.
-I understand.

04:30.470 --> 04:33.166
But if one or both of them
run into trouble again,

04:33.273 --> 04:36.037
I 'm ordering you
to take whatever action is necessary

04:36.142 --> 04:37.837
to shut that thing down.

04:40.246 --> 04:42.146
Teal'c, a word.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.253
What can you tell me
about this Gerak fellow?

04:48.822 --> 04:53.054
He was First Prime of Montu,
a minor Goa'uld who served Ra,

04:53.159 --> 04:55.787
then later fell in with Ba'al
when Ra was killed.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.659
After the fall of the Goa'uld,

04:58.865 --> 05:02.130
Ba'al's armada was led
by a Jaffa named Hubrok.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.771
Hubrok was an ally of Bra'tac's
and would've supported our desire

05:05.872 --> 05:08.170
to reform the Jaffa nation with democracy.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.910
However, approximately four months ago,
Hubrok disappeared.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.173
You think Gerak
had something to do with it?

05:14.714 --> 05:17.182
Though no evidence has been uncovered.

05:17.550 --> 05:20.883
But shortly after Hubrok's disappearance,
Gerak emerged as spokesperson

05:20.987 --> 05:23.615
for the more traditional ways
of the Jaffa High Council.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.852
Which he could control.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.154
Through a series of slow
and deliberate manipulations,

05:29.396 --> 05:31.660
the Council played squarely
into Gerak's hands.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.734
Well, that makes him
one of the most powerful guys out there,

05:34.834 --> 05:36.301
at least that we know of.

05:36.770 --> 05:40.137
I suppose I should meet him face to face.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.401
I will extend your invitation.

05:55.755 --> 05:57.848
All right, Daniel, what does it say?

05:58.158 --> 06:01.059
Well, it seems to follow suit
with many of the religions I've studied.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.923
They tend to weave their doctrines
into simple fable-like narratives

06:04.030 --> 06:06.624
with characters that are meant to be
identifiable to the common individual.

06:06.733 --> 06:10.692
Why don't you read one to me?
I love a good yarn.

06:13.606 --> 06:17.337
They all seem to teach meditation
on one's worth and significance,

06:17.877 --> 06:21.335
the path of righteousness
towards a state of higher being.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.788
What? I'm starving.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.691
The central icon of the religion
seems to be fire.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.687
-I don't need a book to tell me that.
-I mean, that would make sense.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.695
Fire is light, energy, warmth.

06:38.031 --> 06:41.523
And yet on Earth, at some point,
fire became associated

06:41.634 --> 06:44.125
with demonic imagery,
things that are evil.

06:44.370 --> 06:45.837
-Hell, not heaven.
-And?

06:46.906 --> 06:49.204
I'm just wondering if the Ancients
had something to do with that.

06:51.511 --> 06:55.003
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you flip to the end

06:55.715 --> 06:57.649
and see how it all turns out?

06:58.218 --> 07:00.152
(DOOR OPENING)

07:12.532 --> 07:15.467
The village of Ver Eger
has been corrupted.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.402
We didn't do it, I promise.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.268
We're connected to these people,
Harrid and Sallis,

07:20.373 --> 07:23.467
by means of a communication device
that was brought to our galaxy

07:23.576 --> 07:25.737
a long time ago
by a race of people called the Alterans.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.047
Also known as the Ancients.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.748
Look, the point is, we meant no harm.

07:34.821 --> 07:38.689
-We're explorers.
-You know of others in Ver Eger?

07:39.359 --> 07:40.451
Others?

07:41.694 --> 07:43.218
Unbelievers.

07:43.897 --> 07:48.357
I'm sorry, do you want us to tell on people
who don't believe in the Ori?

07:49.769 --> 07:51.498
Devotion is rewarded.

07:51.604 --> 07:54.596
Those who stray
must be guided back to the path.

07:54.707 --> 07:56.868
Seems to me those who stray
get burned to death.

07:58.244 --> 08:01.736
The Ori gave all men and women free will.

08:02.081 --> 08:07.075
If the Ori are so powerful,
why do they need us

08:07.187 --> 08:11.123
to tell them who believes in them
and who doesn't?

08:11.324 --> 08:13.952
The Ori need nothing from us.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.188
It is we who must seek the truth
of the universe

08:17.297 --> 08:18.889
in order to achieve enlightenment.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.393
Been down this road before.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.197
LANDRY: At ease, Colonel.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.002
-How are they doing?
-There's no change, sir.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.874
I know you're concerned for them. So am l.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.411
-But I've got something else for you to do.
-Sir?

08:39.185 --> 08:43.918
Just got a report from Dr. Lindsay
on P3X-421.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.650
Lindsay. Anthropologist, right?

08:45.758 --> 08:47.953
She's been working
with the human population on 421,

08:48.061 --> 08:51.929
helping them get over the loss
of their former false god.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.560
Trouble?

08:53.666 --> 08:57.625
Well, it seems a missionary of sorts
came through the gate yesterday

08:57.737 --> 09:00.900
and started spouting a religion
we haven't encountered before.

09:01.007 --> 09:04.443
Not that we have a problem with people
exploring different faiths.

09:04.544 --> 09:09.106
I suspect we'll see a lot of opportunists
try to fill the void left by the Goa'uld, sir.

09:09.215 --> 09:13.481
This newfound freedom
is quickly going to bring about desperation

09:13.586 --> 09:16.054
if people don't learn
to fend for themselves.

09:16.155 --> 09:20.683
A lot of these, shall we say,
sheltered civilizations

09:21.194 --> 09:25.688
could potentially be taken advantage of
by a charlatan with a flashy bag of tricks.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.465
And in this case?

09:27.734 --> 09:30.794
Well, this missionary
is apparently trying to prove

09:30.903 --> 09:34.236
the validity of his claims
by performing miracles.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.604
Miracles.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.478
I'd like you to take SG-12 and check it out.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.981
Yes, sir.

09:50.990 --> 09:56.587
Amica was forgiven his transgression
and found his way back to the path.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.064
I can't take much more of this.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.629
Sorry to interrupt, but if you brought us
here to try and convert us,

10:02.735 --> 10:03.724
I think it's fair to tell you

10:03.836 --> 10:06.031
that we're really not in the market
for new gods.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.869
The will of the Ori brought you here.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.440
I don't suppose we could talk
to one of these Ori?

10:11.544 --> 10:12.772
Of course.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.646
Well, great. That would be great.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.741
Speak, and they shall hear you.

10:21.754 --> 10:25.451
Okay, look, you can torture us
all you want with your rhetoric,

10:25.558 --> 10:28.493
but we're not gonna crack. Well, I might.
But we're not gonna tell you anything,

10:28.594 --> 10:29.788
because we don't know anything.
Am I right?

10:30.163 --> 10:31.926
Can I talk to your boss?

10:33.466 --> 10:34.728
The...

10:38.905 --> 10:40.270
The Doci.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.705
The one who speaks the word of the Ori.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.178
"Like Egidius of Vil Dare,

10:49.282 --> 10:52.911
"l need to speak things that can
only be spoken in the light of the fire."

10:55.288 --> 10:56.880
Come with me.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.190
Could you not have asked that
an hour ago?

11:02.295 --> 11:03.694
We've been listening to him
drone on and on...

11:03.796 --> 11:04.763
Not you.

11:04.864 --> 11:08.356
What? Not who? Not me? But l...

11:10.269 --> 11:11.759
VALA: I'll wait here.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.880
Quite the entourage.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.458
Welcome.

11:44.303 --> 11:49.263
As he lay there dying in the sun,
the sands of the desert all around him,

11:50.676 --> 11:56.308
Petrus spoke to the rock,
not with his lips, but with his mind.

11:57.383 --> 12:02.719
And the rock wept tears of fresh water,
and his thirst was quenched.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.982
Fear not the Ori.

12:07.860 --> 12:11.921
Fear the darkness that would conceal
the knowledge of the universe.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.560
Believe in the truth of all things

12:14.901 --> 12:18.564
and you, too, may find the path
to enlightenment.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.840
"And a man has no greater thing
under the sun

12:21.941 --> 12:26.901
"than to eat, drink and be merry."
Ecclesiastes, my favorite.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.879
My grandma was a bit of a Bible thumper.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.648
Weekends at Grandma's meant
long, long Sundays

12:35.755 --> 12:38.155
at St. Hilda's
Church of the Grand Epiphany.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.059
Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell.
How you doing?

12:42.462 --> 12:45.898
-I am a Prior of the Ori.
-It's nice to meet you.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.296
Your arrival here was foreseen.

12:49.802 --> 12:50.928
No kidding?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.963
So, you see the future, do you?

12:54.273 --> 12:57.868
Lessons of days gone by
teach us what will come to pass.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.842
I'm a bit of a history buff myself.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.312
Doesn't help me
pick the lotto numbers, though.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.615
So, where are you from?

13:05.084 --> 13:08.918
Where we come from
and where we are going are all the same.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.649
Oh, I get you.

13:11.190 --> 13:15.991
"Wherever you go, there you are."
I think that's Buckaroo Banzai.

13:16.696 --> 13:19.164
Me, I'm from a little planet called Earth.

13:20.199 --> 13:21.860
The home of Daniel Jackson.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.096
He never mentioned that before.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.871
-You know Dr. Jackson, do you?
-From him did we learn of your need.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.780
Our need for what?

13:36.916 --> 13:39.817
The revelation of your destiny.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.716
Doci.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.247
Leave us.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.903
-Hello, I'm...
-Daniel Jackson.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.704
-Right.
-From the planet Earth.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.108
Okay, so, you know my name
and where I'm from.

14:41.213 --> 14:44.910
So, I assume you also know
how I'm connected to this man's mind,

14:46.152 --> 14:47.619
why I'm here.

14:48.421 --> 14:52.289
You see, we're explorers.
We'd very much like to get to know you,

14:53.259 --> 14:55.591
your society, how you came to be.

14:55.695 --> 14:59.290
A Prior has been dispatched to the place
from whence you've come.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.132
Really?

15:03.703 --> 15:07.696
You can do that?
I thought we were in another galaxy.

15:07.807 --> 15:10.139
It is the will of the Ori

15:10.676 --> 15:15.636
that we should spread Origin
to all those blessed by their creation.

15:16.148 --> 15:21.108
Okay, well, I think you should understand
that there are many different kinds

15:21.287 --> 15:23.915
of people in the place from whence I come.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.053
People who believe
in many different things.

15:27.159 --> 15:30.720
-They shall find the path to enlightenment.
-Right.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.760
Well, I think you should also understand

15:32.865 --> 15:36.392
that they may not see your way
as the only way.

15:36.502 --> 15:40.404
The power and the greatness of the Ori
cannot be denied.

15:41.040 --> 15:45.977
Those who reject the path
to enlightenment must be destroyed.

15:48.147 --> 15:49.409
Right.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.341
I was afraid of that.

15:57.223 --> 16:00.420
George Washington,
one of our country's founding fathers

16:00.526 --> 16:02.517
and first president, once said,

16:02.628 --> 16:05.791
"True friendship is a plant of slow growth

16:05.965 --> 16:09.093
"and must undergo and withstand
the shocks of adversity

16:09.602 --> 16:12.093
"before it is entitled to the appellation."

16:12.938 --> 16:16.806
The First Prime of Horus,
Karrok of the High Plains, once said,

16:16.909 --> 16:20.037
"There is more honor in dying
at the hands of a brother

16:20.146 --> 16:22.444
"than there is killing a would-be friend."

16:24.984 --> 16:26.611
He was a wise man.

16:29.055 --> 16:33.151
He was killed shortly after losing
one of the greatest battles in history.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.884
Oh, well, I hope it wasn't his brother
that shot him.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.792
It was me.

16:39.098 --> 16:43.228
The Jaffa was a fool in every respect.
He did not deserve an honorable death.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.495
I see.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.001
(SIRENS BLARING)

16:46.105 --> 16:48.369
MAN: (OVER PA)
Unscheduled incoming wormhole.

16:50.042 --> 16:52.272
I better see what this is about.

16:52.478 --> 16:55.879
Teal'c, please escort our guest
to the briefing room.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.876
The Book of Origin says,

17:02.154 --> 17:05.351
"Those who seek the path
to enlightenment

17:05.658 --> 17:07.956
"must not be lead astray."

17:08.227 --> 17:09.387
Right.

17:09.895 --> 17:12.887
See, that can be interpreted
a number of different ways.

17:14.200 --> 17:18.034
I think maybe I know what the Ori are.
Who they are.

17:19.004 --> 17:21.472
And I'm not denying
they are very powerful beings,

17:21.574 --> 17:24.543
but if I'm right, they're not gods.

17:25.745 --> 17:26.905
They're like the Ascended beings I know.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.640
They simply have a greater understanding
of the knowledge of the universe.

17:29.749 --> 17:34.311
What is a god but a being
that is worshipped by those beneath?

17:34.420 --> 17:37.878
Is great knowledge, power, understanding

17:37.990 --> 17:40.959
not enough for you to revere the Ori?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.652
Respect, yes, certainly,

17:43.496 --> 17:46.260
but that doesn't mean I would murder
innocent people in their name.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.367
I guess what I'm trying to understand
is whether the Ori

17:49.468 --> 17:51.959
have spoken to you directly
and told you to worship them,

17:52.071 --> 17:56.201
or whether you've misinterpreted
some evidence you found along the way

17:56.308 --> 17:58.868
and developed this religion on your own.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.913
I can't speak for everyone in my galaxy,
but in my own humble opinion,

18:02.314 --> 18:05.306
I don't believe that any individual
or society can achieve enlightenment

18:05.417 --> 18:06.850
through fearmongering
and forced servitude,

18:06.952 --> 18:09.045
no matter what power is presented
as evidence.

18:09.722 --> 18:13.055
That's something the Ascended beings
I know very clearly seem to understand.

18:13.659 --> 18:16.492
Look, don't get me wrong. I mean, we
should all be trying to better ourselves.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.962
I mean, if ascension really is the ultimate
end we're trying to achieve, then so be it.

18:20.065 --> 18:22.499
But we should all be allowed
to get there or not of our own free will.

18:25.237 --> 18:27.603
You can kill me for saying that,
but that is what I believe,

18:27.907 --> 18:31.502
and nothing you say or do
will ever change my mind.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.511
Come.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.334
The Ori hear you.

19:21.727 --> 19:25.128
(VOICES ECHOING)
We do not require blind faith.

19:26.699 --> 19:30.567
Only that you believe
what you see and know to be true.

19:32.137 --> 19:36.233
I realize this is just a friendly meeting,
but on behalf of our planet's leaders,

19:36.342 --> 19:39.334
I've been asked to present
a few thoughts for you to consider,

19:39.979 --> 19:42.243
some points that we can discuss
in the future,

19:42.448 --> 19:44.746
possibly looking forward
to an official treaty

19:44.850 --> 19:47.250
between our world and the Jaffa nation.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.513
Who is that?

19:52.858 --> 19:57.386
Lieutenant Colonel Mitchell, SG-12,
and a gentleman we encountered

19:57.496 --> 20:02.195
on another planet who claims that
he represents some gods called the Ori.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.126
I think we have yet to see the real fallout

20:05.237 --> 20:08.764
from dismantling the infrastructure
established by the Goa'uld.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.102
Indeed.

20:10.743 --> 20:14.201
We have already seen the rise
of individuals and organizations

20:14.313 --> 20:15.678
who are threatening to challenge us.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.716
There are as many humans out there
as there are Jaffa.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.683
But if we don't continue to work together,

20:21.820 --> 20:25.381
the victory that we both worked
so long and hard for

20:26.358 --> 20:27.985
could result in chaos.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.501
We are Ori.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.798
And you instruct these people
to worship you?

20:39.905 --> 20:42.305
We are their creators.

20:43.108 --> 20:47.044
All who follow the path
will join us in enlightenment.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.943
Do you know who the Alterans are?

20:49.048 --> 20:52.176
Those who abandon the path are evil.

20:52.618 --> 20:54.643
Evil? Why?

20:54.753 --> 20:56.846
-They shielded you.
-Really?

20:56.956 --> 21:00.084
I didn't really think they did much of
anything for us, but I guess I was wrong.

21:00.192 --> 21:03.787
The truth of the universe
has been obstructed.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.990
All will know the power of the Ori.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.567
Hallowed are the Ori.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.516
Vitals are returning to normal.

21:24.683 --> 21:26.583
I wonder what that was all about.

21:26.685 --> 21:29.415
I don't know,
but he was in some sort of stress.

21:31.657 --> 21:35.525
We can't seem to disconnect the stones
or turn off the device.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.196
It is the will of the Ori.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.694
I figured you might say that.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.132
Are you sure there's nothing you can do?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.327
If you help us out here,

21:45.437 --> 21:48.099
I guarantee we'll be more receptive
to those stories you wanna tell.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.641
Call it a miracle, if you want.

21:52.077 --> 21:56.309
When Hannor Mir fell from above
and learned to fly on the way down,

21:57.282 --> 21:59.682
that was a miracle.

22:01.820 --> 22:02.980
Right.

22:03.689 --> 22:07.682
These planets you have mentioned all
have plentiful naquadah mines on them.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.387
And substantial human populations.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.463
Whose side are you on, Jaffa?

22:13.899 --> 22:17.460
There are no sides here,
just topics of conversation.

22:17.569 --> 22:21.164
I wish to meet this Prior of the Ori.

22:21.707 --> 22:24.733
If he preaches faith in false gods,

22:25.711 --> 22:27.576
then that is a concern for all of us.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.271
I wish to hear his claims

22:30.849 --> 22:31.907
and challenge him.

22:52.438 --> 22:54.099
-What's going on?
-This is bad.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.366
Worse than being burned to death?

22:55.474 --> 22:58.602
It appears our ascended Ancients and
the Ori have a slight difference of opinion.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.302
See, the Ori seem to think
that because they're ascended,

23:00.412 --> 23:01.777
human beings should worship them.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.711
-All humans.
-And if we don't?

23:03.816 --> 23:06.284
Then we're unworthy of living
and should be destroyed.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.819
I don't think enlightenment means
what they think it means.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.548
See, apparently, our ascended Ancients

23:10.656 --> 23:12.817
have been shielding our existence
from the Ori.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.187
They've been protecting us?

23:14.293 --> 23:15.885
The Ori seem to think
that our Ancients are evil

23:16.028 --> 23:17.996
because they haven't shared the secrets
of the universe with us.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.758
Well, I hate secrets,
at least the ones I don't know.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.863
See, the problem is the Ori now know
our galaxy is inhabited by humans

23:22.968 --> 23:23.957
because of us.

23:24.069 --> 23:27.835
I refuse to accept the blame for that.
Curiosity is part of human nature.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.635
Look, if the Ancients knew
that the Ori were so bad,

23:29.741 --> 23:30.799
why didn't they stop us from coming here?

23:30.909 --> 23:31.898
Free will.

23:33.679 --> 23:34.839
Right.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.106
If they have been protecting us,

23:36.215 --> 23:38.615
there's no reason to believe
they won't continue.

23:38.717 --> 23:41.948
The Ancients may be protecting us from
the Ori, but not their human followers.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.454
See, Ancients won't interfere
in any lower planes of existence.

23:44.556 --> 23:46.683
If anybody from our galaxy
wants to worship the Ori,

23:46.792 --> 23:48.020
apparently that's our choice.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.254
And they won't stop Priors
from coming through the gate

23:50.362 --> 23:51.727
because apparently
they've already sent one.

23:51.830 --> 23:54.094
The Ori have given Priors special powers,
and that's not fair.

23:54.199 --> 23:55.632
They're still human.

23:55.734 --> 23:59.261
And highly-evolved humans
can have some pretty amazing abilities.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.832
They're using the secrets of the universe
that the Ori have given them

24:02.941 --> 24:04.238
to spread word of the Ori's godliness.

24:04.343 --> 24:06.470
And when people don't see the light,
it's gonna be...

24:06.578 --> 24:08.443
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

24:08.547 --> 24:11.516
I'm starting to think
that sending Priors is just the beginning.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.519
We could be talking crusade here.
We need to warn Earth.

24:13.585 --> 24:14.882
We need to get out of these people.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.857
(FIRE CRACKLING)

24:29.501 --> 24:32.493
Take the unbelievers back to Ver Eger.

24:32.871 --> 24:36.898
Let its cleansing mark forever
the beginning of a new age.

24:38.911 --> 24:43.211
Evil has raised a great many unbelievers
in a far-off place.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.580
They must be shown the path.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.817
Hallowed are the Ori.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.015
Hallowed are the Ori.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.867
What are we doing?

25:11.143 --> 25:13.338
Why did he bring us back here?

25:15.380 --> 25:19.749
I think he's using us to weed out
any other heretics that might be here.

25:20.586 --> 25:23.350
I still don't get why the Ori
just don't do it themselves.

25:23.455 --> 25:24.786
They're supposed to be gods.

25:24.890 --> 25:27.290
Aren't gods all-seeing,
all-knowing, all-powerful?

25:27.392 --> 25:30.793
Well, the universe is infinite, remember?
Apparently, that's a lot to keep track of.

25:30.896 --> 25:31.920
I suppose.

25:32.030 --> 25:35.363
They didn't even know about our galaxy.
Well, until recently.

25:37.569 --> 25:39.332
That's not our fault.

25:39.771 --> 25:43.468
You'd think at least
they'd keep on top of their own people.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.708
I get the feeling
the Ori let their devout followers

25:46.812 --> 25:50.179
do their enforcing for them.
It confirms their loyalty.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.246
Okay, why did we let the Prior
bring us back here?

25:54.419 --> 25:57.183
Well, because I don't think
he was gonna give us much choice.

25:57.289 --> 26:00.281
Besides, I'm starting to think that might
be our best way to contact Earth

26:00.392 --> 26:02.053
-and warn them about what we know.
-How?

26:03.295 --> 26:06.025
Well, Fannis said
that his sect had found other artifacts.

26:06.131 --> 26:08.759
You think they also have
a terminal device to go with the stones?

26:08.867 --> 26:10.232
If they do,
and we can find it and hook up the stones,

26:10.335 --> 26:12.303
maybe we can get this communication
thing going both ways.

26:12.571 --> 26:17.167
Right. If the Prior is using us
to weed out other unbelievers,

26:18.644 --> 26:21.943
how do we make contact with Fannis
without giving him away?

26:22.114 --> 26:23.342
We can't.

26:25.951 --> 26:28.078
You do not believe in a higher power?

26:28.186 --> 26:29.983
Well, it's complicated.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.955
There are a lot of different points of view
about that subject around here.

26:33.058 --> 26:36.323
Jaffa have recently shed the dominance
of false gods

26:36.428 --> 26:38.760
that have enslaved us
for many generations.

26:38.864 --> 26:42.231
But many have long believed
in the path to enlightenment.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.734
PRlOR: Origin will guide you on this path,

26:44.836 --> 26:47.999
and those who revere its wisdom
shall be uplifted.

26:48.206 --> 26:51.334
I have come to spread the word
to the unbelievers

26:51.610 --> 26:53.475
who have been sheltered

26:54.112 --> 26:55.807
and raised by evil.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.613
You have no idea how much he sounds
like my grandma.

27:04.723 --> 27:07.248
It's a pretty big village.
I suspect that Fannis and his gang

27:07.359 --> 27:09.691
did a reasonable job
hiding their sacrilegious artifacts.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.353
Well, we have to do something.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.021
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

27:26.645 --> 27:28.510
-No, no, no!
-Fannis.

27:28.613 --> 27:30.478
(JACKSON EXHALING)

27:30.949 --> 27:32.382
You shouldn't have come.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.681
-They're using us to get to you.
-So I suspected.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.119
Either that, or you've truly come
to see the power of the Ori.

27:38.690 --> 27:40.385
-Not bloody likely.
-You have to leave.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.724
If I can help you speak the reality
of our existence to your people,

27:45.497 --> 27:49.263
maybe one day, in turn,
they will spread that word back here.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.866
You said you had other artifacts
besides the stones.

27:54.973 --> 27:57.134
-I will show you.
-No, just tell me.

27:57.242 --> 27:59.107
Now, we're looking for
a large dome-shaped object

27:59.211 --> 28:02.442
with a blue crystal on top.
The stones fit inside of it.

28:02.547 --> 28:04.777
-Come.
-Fannis.

28:07.786 --> 28:09.151
You're risking your life.

28:09.254 --> 28:12.621
Harrid, Sallis and l,
all those who believe as we do

28:12.724 --> 28:16.592
have known for some time
that we may give our lives for our cause.

28:16.695 --> 28:20.392
I can only hope one day
the truth comes to bear as a result.

28:56.435 --> 28:57.459
And...

29:03.341 --> 29:06.469
Whoa. Something just happened.

29:21.993 --> 29:23.858
(CHOKING)

29:32.237 --> 29:33.397
Fannis?

29:38.143 --> 29:39.633
(GROANING)

29:53.425 --> 29:56.292
And the people shall deliver the wicked

29:56.495 --> 29:58.656
unto your divine judgment,

29:59.464 --> 30:02.831
where their sins
shall be weighed in balance

30:04.002 --> 30:08.098
with all that is just and true.

30:19.784 --> 30:22.810
The Ori are great. I love the Ori.

30:23.755 --> 30:24.881
I'm a believer.

30:24.990 --> 30:29.359
What's the matter with you people?
I'm telling you, I've seen the light.

30:29.761 --> 30:31.228
I don't think they're buying it.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.889
Well, I've heard you do better.

30:34.165 --> 30:35.894
(GROANING)

30:45.277 --> 30:49.941
Glorious are the Ori
who lead us to salvation,

30:50.749 --> 30:54.981
who didst fight the evil
that would doom us to mortal sin.

30:56.454 --> 31:00.015
Did they defeat the old spirits
and cast them out.

31:00.392 --> 31:03.725
And now, with the strength of our will,

31:03.828 --> 31:08.026
they do call upon us to prevail
against the corruption

31:08.133 --> 31:09.998
of all unbelievers.

31:10.101 --> 31:13.502
Well, second time's the charm.

They lead you to their realm with the
path that is laid out in The Book of Origin.

31:26.451 --> 31:29.215
All you need do is follow their teachings.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.554
I'm very sorry.

31:31.656 --> 31:33.954
You'll have to excuse us for a moment.
Please continue.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.253
Colonel.

31:37.796 --> 31:41.391
They woke up, just for a moment,
and then they lost consciousness again.

31:41.499 --> 31:43.899
-They say anything?
-Yes, they did.

31:45.136 --> 31:47.001
"Guide us on the path

31:47.105 --> 31:49.403
"so that we may triumph

31:49.841 --> 31:52.537
"over the enemy of our salvation

31:52.777 --> 31:54.506
"and be with you

31:54.813 --> 31:59.045
"in the end of ends
on the planes of enlightenment."

32:10.428 --> 32:12.692
-What is the meaning of this?
-I'm very sorry.

32:12.797 --> 32:15.459
We've just received some information
about our visitor here

32:15.567 --> 32:18.331
that demands we take every precaution.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.337
We'll have to take the staff, sir.

32:27.078 --> 32:30.241
-And you'll have to come with us.
-I demand to know what you've learned.

32:30.348 --> 32:33.977
All I wish to do is spread the word
of the Ori to your world.

32:34.085 --> 32:36.246
Actually, that was never going to happen.

32:36.354 --> 32:38.549
Then, I must leave at once.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.385
That's not gonna happen, either.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.556
Hallowed are the Ori.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.688
ALL: Hallowed are the Ori.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.071
Hallowed are the Ori.

only this time it's both of them.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.433
Now, hold on.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.560
This device draws its power
directly from subspace.

33:59.671 --> 34:01.935
It'll react very badly to an explosion.
You can't blow it up.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.405
Perhaps we should send it
through the Stargate.

34:03.508 --> 34:05.669
-Genius.
-No, well, it also uses subspace

34:05.777 --> 34:08.109
to communicate with another galaxy
across the universe. I mean,

34:08.213 --> 34:11.011
there's no reason to believe that Daniel
and Vala won't stay connected to it

34:11.116 --> 34:12.310
even from another planet.

34:12.417 --> 34:14.908
I have a different idea.
Tell him to start dialing the gate.

34:15.019 --> 34:16.577
-Where to?
-Wherever.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.178
Wherever? Well, all right.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.304
Chevron two encoded.

34:38.309 --> 34:40.140
-Chevron three encoded.
-Walter.

-Proceed.

Dr. Lam says that Daniel and Vala
have regained consciousness.

36:12.203 --> 36:13.397
Well done.

36:13.504 --> 36:15.165
See, that's what I'm talking about.

(FIRE CRACKLING)

36:38.963 --> 36:41.363
You have served the Ori well.

36:42.333 --> 36:43.960
I bow in humble account.

36:44.068 --> 36:45.262
Come

36:45.870 --> 36:48.805
and gaze upon the flames
of enlightenment.

36:55.580 --> 36:58.174
Let its power wash over you.

37:25.143 --> 37:27.634
Great holy armies shall be gathered

37:27.745 --> 37:31.112
and trained to fight all who embrace evil.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.683
In the name of the gods,
ships shall be built

37:33.785 --> 37:36.845
to carry our warriors
out amongst the stars,

37:36.955 --> 37:39.355
and we will spread Origin

37:39.457 --> 37:42.153
to all the unbelievers.

37:42.627 --> 37:46.085
The power of the Ori
will be felt far and wide,

37:47.165 --> 37:49.633
and the wicked shall be vanquished.

37:53.204 --> 37:55.229
Hallowed are the Ori.

37:55.473 --> 37:57.373
Hallowed are the Ori.

38:12.757 --> 38:14.019
Thank you.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.960
General Landry is ready for us.

38:26.704 --> 38:30.401
So, you think we should expect
more of these Priors to show up?

38:30.508 --> 38:33.204
I would be very surprised if they didn't.

38:33.678 --> 38:34.702
How?

38:34.946 --> 38:38.541
We know one came through the Stargate,
but if their galaxy's so far away...

38:38.649 --> 38:41.584
I suspect the Ori have the power
to make a lot of things happen.

38:41.686 --> 38:44.086
Still, for the Priors, I think
we can assume it's a one-way trip.

38:44.188 --> 38:47.021
Don't think they have a problem
with self-sacrifice.

38:47.125 --> 38:51.027
You think the Ancients here in our galaxy
will continue to stop the Ori

38:51.129 --> 38:53.723
from using their power
to attack us directly?

38:53.831 --> 38:55.093
I hope so. I...

38:55.199 --> 38:57.394
So, how do we fight these guys?

38:57.602 --> 39:00.366
And I mean the message
as much as the men.

39:00.738 --> 39:03.332
A lot of folks out there are gonna buy
what these guys are selling.

39:03.441 --> 39:07.400
Hopefully now many have been educated
to the ways of false gods.

39:07.678 --> 39:10.112
Yes, but we're not talking about humans
with snakes in their heads

39:10.214 --> 39:12.273
with a slightly better understanding
of technology.

39:12.383 --> 39:14.214
See, their power isn't false.

39:14.318 --> 39:17.549
The Priors are gonna offer to people
what will seem like proof of God.

39:17.655 --> 39:20.556
Proof of powerful beings
is not proof of God.

39:20.758 --> 39:21.884
I'm not saying it is.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.257
Look, just because we know
there are some beings

39:24.362 --> 39:26.330
on a higher plane of existence
than ourselves,

39:26.431 --> 39:30.458
does not mean there's not
an order of being higher than them.

39:31.335 --> 39:33.735
At least I reckon
that's what my grandma would say.

39:33.838 --> 39:36.329
And the universe is supposedly infinite.

39:36.441 --> 39:39.501
Which, in my book, makes it impossible
to know everything.

39:39.610 --> 39:43.671
I mean, somewhere in there, you gotta
fill in the blanks with a little faith.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.779
I had a grandma, too.

39:50.588 --> 39:53.250
So, business as usual, sir?

39:53.357 --> 39:54.847
Let them bring it.

39:54.959 --> 39:58.087
We'll use our strengths
against their weaknesses.

39:58.229 --> 40:01.323
That's a pretty good strategy
for any kind of business you're in.

40:04.635 --> 40:06.728
I'm glad you two are okay.

40:11.576 --> 40:12.634
Amen.

40:20.585 --> 40:21.609
Hey.

40:22.587 --> 40:25.181
Wow, what the hell are you doing here?

40:25.389 --> 40:26.947
Nice to see you, too.

40:27.058 --> 40:30.459
No, no, sorry,
but I just wasn't expecting to see you.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.291
Yeah, well, I was in the neighborhood.

40:34.866 --> 40:38.097
And I've got a little surprise for Mitchell.

40:38.903 --> 40:41.201
Oh, yeah, he loved the last one.

40:42.106 --> 40:45.269
The fact you didn't tell him that we were
all moving on to different positions.

40:45.376 --> 40:48.402
Yeah. Sorry you missed Daedalus.

40:48.613 --> 40:51.514
-No, you're not.
-You're right. I'm not.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.878
Listen, I just had a briefing with Landry.

40:58.122 --> 41:01.353
About your stuff.

41:01.559 --> 41:02.617
Yeah, yeah.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.528
Sounds like it could be a problem.

41:06.731 --> 41:10.167
Well, we've been up against
some pretty bad guys before.

41:10.935 --> 41:12.402
Not so pretty.

41:12.937 --> 41:14.529
Overdressed, yes.

41:14.972 --> 41:18.430
-Been through some tough situations.
-That we always won.

41:18.876 --> 41:23.176
Yeah, but didn't you feel that was because
we had someone looking out for us?

41:25.783 --> 41:27.842
I don't think I would say this
to anyone else,

41:27.952 --> 41:31.012
but for the first time, I'm scared.

41:35.526 --> 41:36.720
I'm hungry.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.493
Me too.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.093
Well...

41:55.146 --> 41:57.546
Yeah, man.

41:58.082 --> 41:59.709
This is good.

42:01.118 --> 42:02.847
-Still a rush.
-Yeah.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.313
I don't know why
I didn't get back on the horse sooner,

42:05.423 --> 42:08.221
except I really didn't think you could
take one of these things for a joyride.

42:08.726 --> 42:12.526
Now, see, that's one of the great things
about being a general.

42:12.630 --> 42:14.860
You pretty much get to do
whatever you want.

42:15.333 --> 42:19.030
Well, I suppose after you've saved
the world seven or eight times.

42:19.136 --> 42:20.797
-Who's counting, huh?
-Teal'c.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.231
Actually, he mentions it quite often.

42:27.912 --> 42:31.848
So, Mitchell, I hear
you haven't picked out your team yet.

42:31.949 --> 42:34.008
I'm hoping I won't have to, sir.

42:34.118 --> 42:36.985
Why? Did General Landry
say something about it, sir?

42:37.355 --> 42:38.515
He did.

42:38.723 --> 42:40.418
Are you going to tell me, sir?

42:41.125 --> 42:43.184
He said you're gonna be fine, Mitchell.

42:45.263 --> 42:46.457
Thank you, sir.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.327
You mind if I kick in the afterburners, sir?

42:48.432 --> 42:49.763
Oh, please.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.299
Thank you, sir.
