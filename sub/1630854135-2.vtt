00:04.787 --> 00:07.355
<i>In the nation's
largest city,</i>

00:08.878 --> 00:10.053
<i>the vicious and violent
members of the underworld</i>

00:10.097 --> 00:11.576
<i>are hunted by the detectives</i>

00:11.620 --> 00:14.710
<i>of the Organized Crime
Control Bureau.</i>

00:14.753 --> 00:17.234
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:20.368 --> 00:21.673
<i>New York.</i>

00:21.717 --> 00:23.458
<i>Silas.</i>

00:23.501 --> 00:26.113
<i>Two names synonymous
with style and sophistication</i>

00:26.156 --> 00:27.679
<i>are proud
to invite you</i>

00:27.723 --> 00:29.594
<i>to the future
of entertainment.</i>

00:29.638 --> 00:31.509
<i>Welcome to The Majestic,</i>

00:31.553 --> 00:35.339
<i>New York's first
and only luxury casino.</i>

00:38.168 --> 00:42.085
<i>Step inside and go
beyond your wildest dreams,</i>

00:42.129 --> 00:44.174
<i>where you are
just one spin away</i>

00:44.218 --> 00:46.872
<i>from the most exciting night
of your life.</i>

00:49.397 --> 00:52.487
<i>New York,
your luck has changed.</i>

00:52.530 --> 00:56.665
<i>And the Silas family is here
to make sure it's majestic.</i>

01:00.234 --> 01:02.627
Just what the city needs,
more nightlife.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.455
We should probably
take our seats.

01:04.499 --> 01:09.243
The Silas family has built,
like, half of Manhattan.

01:09.286 --> 01:10.722
They know
how to grease the wheels.

01:10.766 --> 01:13.116
They know who to invite
to their dog and pony shows.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.639
Are you gonna do this
all night?

01:14.683 --> 01:16.598
Well, I told you, I don't
like this political stuff.

01:16.641 --> 01:18.817
I don't either,
but I needed a date.

01:18.861 --> 01:21.124
So you're welcome.

01:21.168 --> 01:22.604
You should have
invited Henry Cole.

01:24.258 --> 01:26.216
- That's not funny.
- It wasn't meant to be.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.392
That poor man is being
pushed out of his home

01:28.436 --> 01:29.437
to build a casino.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.178
It is a tragedy.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.701
We made him
a very generous offer,

01:32.744 --> 01:34.442
several actually,

01:34.485 --> 01:36.487
the kind that can change
families for generations.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.794
So anybody who doesn't
understand the value of that,

01:38.837 --> 01:40.230
that's a tragedy.

01:42.667 --> 01:43.886
Were you watching
the presentation

01:43.929 --> 01:45.235
from Teddy's laptop?

01:45.279 --> 01:46.671
- We were.
- Who the hell are you?

01:46.715 --> 01:48.499
All right, Teddy.

01:48.543 --> 01:49.718
Warmed 'em up.

01:49.761 --> 01:52.590
You kids close the deal.
- Thank you.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.332
Ah, Sergeant Bell, I was
looking for you out there.

01:55.376 --> 01:57.204
We got hung up at work,
but we're here.

01:57.247 --> 01:58.596
We're ready
to take our seats.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.252
This is Detective Stabler.
- Sir.

02:02.296 --> 02:04.602
Must be quite the detective
to be on her arm tonight.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.909
Well, she took pity on me.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.867
That's gotta
happen a lot, huh?

02:08.911 --> 02:10.347
- Teddy.
- Oh.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.870
His sense of humor
takes getting used to.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.350
- That was humor?
- No, no.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.483
I'm actually
a big Blue Lives Matter guy.

02:15.526 --> 02:17.180
We all are--
my father, my wife, myself.

02:17.224 --> 02:20.270
So we really appreciate
you guys coming.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.577
OK, well, we are
gonna take our seats.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.622
Very lovely to meet you.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.276
Looking forward
to the presentation.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.582
Yeah.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.497
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

02:30.628 --> 02:31.716
Thank you, Detective.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.240
Yeah.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.336
Why were they back here?

02:42.379 --> 02:43.902
Because I invited them.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.384
You want
to take the reins, son,

02:47.428 --> 02:51.432
you got to learn to ride every
type of animal in this city

02:51.475 --> 02:53.303
or they'll stomp all over you.

02:55.958 --> 02:58.482
Don't ever make me
look bad again.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.833
And don't screw this up.

03:04.532 --> 03:10.233
Hey.

03:10.277 --> 03:14.585
You are the next king
of New York.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.239
Hmm?

03:16.283 --> 03:17.458
You're my queen.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.503
That's right.

03:19.547 --> 03:22.332
So let's go out there
and show them what we got

03:22.376 --> 03:23.638
and how we can deliver.

03:26.728 --> 03:30.601
Somebody start that video
from the top

03:30.645 --> 03:32.690
and wait for my cue on stage.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.910
- But we already played it.
- Yeah, play it again!

03:38.522 --> 03:39.871
<i>New York.</i>

03:39.915 --> 03:41.656
<i>Silas.</i>

03:41.699 --> 03:43.701

03:43.745 --> 03:47.444
all:
Henry! Henry! Henry!

03:47.488 --> 03:51.318
That casino can kiss my ass!

03:55.496 --> 03:58.934
The $1.4 billion construction
has been delayed

03:58.977 --> 04:00.849
<i>by this man,
Henry Cole,</i>

04:00.892 --> 04:03.460
<i>who refuses to leave his home
to make way for the casino.</i>

04:03.504 --> 04:06.028
I raised my daughter
in this apartment.

04:06.071 --> 04:07.943
My wife died in this apartment.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.858
And now they want me to leave?

04:09.901 --> 04:11.860
Cole, a retired artist
and teacher,

04:11.903 --> 04:14.689
has become something
of a folk hero in New York,

04:14.732 --> 04:17.344
where crowds have gathered
to support his stand.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.867
All right.
Love you too.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.303
The Majestic?

04:20.347 --> 04:22.566
I'm the majestic up in here.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.960
I'm the majestic up in here!

04:26.962 --> 04:28.920
What are you gonna do
about this guy?

04:28.964 --> 04:30.705
You told me you wanted
to keep things running--

04:30.748 --> 04:32.968
I told you what I want you
to do about him.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.796
Are you serious about that?

04:36.537 --> 04:37.929
Do you want to keep your job?

04:41.455 --> 04:44.109
All right.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.894
Full steam ahead.

05:48.522 --> 05:49.740
Aah! <i></i>

06:04.625 --> 06:06.670
Detective Stabler. <i>
- Oh, good.</i>

06:06.714 --> 06:08.672
<i>They gave me the right number.</i>
- Who is this?

06:08.716 --> 06:10.457
Detective,
this is Teddy Silas.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.546
You were my guest the other
night at the casino unveiling.

06:12.589 --> 06:15.026
Is this a good time?
- Yeah, sure.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.724
I just wanted to apologize

06:16.767 --> 06:18.856
for my behavior
the other night.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.641
I was a little anxious
from all the pressure.

06:20.684 --> 06:24.035
And well, it was not
my best side, you know?

06:24.079 --> 06:25.515
Well, you had a lot
on your plate.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.169
You were a guest
of the Silas family.

06:27.212 --> 06:28.692
And I've always been taught
that a host

06:28.736 --> 06:30.694
should never make anyone
feel uncomfortable,

06:30.738 --> 06:34.176
so please accept my apology.

06:34.219 --> 06:37.440
OK, well,
I appreciate the call.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.920
Wholly unnecessary,
but thanks.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.704
It's just such a big project
with so much at stake.

06:40.748 --> 06:43.011
You know, we really
want to make sure

06:43.054 --> 06:45.666
we have everybody's support,
police especially.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.537
<i>And now, of course, with the
tragedy at hand, you know--</i>

06:47.581 --> 06:49.757
What tragedy?

06:49.800 --> 06:51.672
You haven't heard?

06:51.715 --> 06:52.803
Oh, God.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.590
Henry Cole,
our tenant,

06:56.633 --> 06:58.809
he--he got drunk.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.985
He fell off his balcony.
He passed away.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.859
When did this happen?

07:04.902 --> 07:07.078
Just last night.
I barely slept after I heard.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.733
He was such a folk hero
to the city.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.518
<i>I have to tell you,
even I was starting</i>

07:11.561 --> 07:12.780
<i>to root for him,
you know?</i>

07:12.823 --> 07:15.086
We decided to pay
for his funeral expenses.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.784
We thought it was the least
we could do for his family.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.744
<i>Hello?</i>

07:20.788 --> 07:23.747
Uh, I gotta get going,
but thanks for the call.

07:23.791 --> 07:24.835
Well, listen,
if you ever need--

07:32.190 --> 07:35.019
Sarge, where are you at?

07:35.063 --> 07:36.499
All right, well, stay there.
I'll be there in 20.

07:36.543 --> 07:37.674
We have a problem.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.773
Grabbed a coffee.
Hope that's OK.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.041
Oat milk's pretty fancy
for a squad room.

08:40.084 --> 08:42.565
It's not a squad room.
It's a task force.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.307
Also that oat milk was labeled,

08:45.350 --> 08:47.831
which means it's off-limits.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.006
So you must be Jet.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.660
You mean you saw
my name was on it

08:50.704 --> 08:52.662
and you used it anyway?

08:52.706 --> 08:53.663
I'm Jamie.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.840
<i>Construction continues</i>

08:56.884 --> 08:59.321
<i>on New York's Majestic Casino
this morning</i>

08:59.364 --> 09:01.628
<i>despite the apparent
accidental death</i>

09:01.671 --> 09:03.064
<i>of nearby resident</i>

09:03.107 --> 09:06.284

Henry Cole.</i>

09:06.328 --> 09:08.809
<i>The casino,
spearheaded by long-term...</i>

09:08.852 --> 09:10.245
It wasn't an accident.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.855
Henry Cole?

09:11.899 --> 09:13.291
The man lives his entire life
in that apartment,

09:13.335 --> 09:14.771
but when it comes
to maybe stopping

09:14.815 --> 09:16.077
a billion-dollar project,

09:16.120 --> 09:17.731
he "accidentally" falls out
of his window?

09:17.774 --> 09:19.123
No way.
No way.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.690
No way what?

09:20.734 --> 09:22.953
The Silas family's
behind this somehow.

09:22.997 --> 09:23.954
Wait, what?

09:23.998 --> 09:26.087
Teddy calls me.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.654
I just want to see
the ME report.

09:27.697 --> 09:29.917
I want to treat this
as a homicide.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.614
But you said
Teddy called you.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.790
- Exactly.
- You're not making any sense.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.662
I'm making perfect sense.
Who is this?

09:35.705 --> 09:37.707
Detective Jamie Whelan,
new guy.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.232
When's he hitting puberty?

09:41.276 --> 09:42.973
Make him feel welcome, Elliot.

09:43.017 --> 09:45.759
I told you
I wanted an old head.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.152
I don't want
these Tic Tac guys.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.371
TikTok.

09:49.414 --> 09:50.633
I don't care
what it's called.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.722
Look, he has
serious credentials.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.071
And if I didn't know
any better,

09:54.115 --> 09:57.422
I'd say he was a Stabler
in the making.

09:57.466 --> 09:59.381
Also, I believe
the children are our future,

09:59.424 --> 10:01.165
so let them lead the way.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.732
All right, well,
I'll take them over to Cole's,

10:02.776 --> 10:03.777
see how he does.

10:03.820 --> 10:04.995
- No, you're not.
- What?

10:05.039 --> 10:06.170
You're gonna
take him to lunch.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.781
Buy him fish sticks
and tater tots?

10:07.824 --> 10:09.260
And you're gonna
get to know him.

10:09.304 --> 10:11.654
And you are not opening
a murder investigation

10:11.698 --> 10:13.438
on a guy
who got drunk and fell,

10:13.482 --> 10:14.831
especially
when it has to do with one

10:14.875 --> 10:16.920
of the most powerful families
in New York City.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.705
Uh-uh, not today.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.099
Do you hear me?

10:22.143 --> 10:24.145
I hear you.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.190
By the way, good luck.
That dress--

10:26.234 --> 10:27.322
she won't say no to anything.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.936
<i>When asked
about the decision</i>

10:32.980 --> 10:34.808
<i>to press ahead

10:34.851 --> 10:36.723
<i>in light of today's
tragic circumstances...</i>

10:36.766 --> 10:38.420
- Morning, Jet.
- Good morning, Detective.

10:38.463 --> 10:39.334
- Morn-- <i>

10:40.030 --> 10:41.118
<i>"we have a responsibility</i>

<i>to the community to

10:44.121 --> 10:45.775
Detective Stabler, I'm--

10:45.819 --> 10:47.081
I know who you are.
Let's take a ride.

11:00.181 --> 11:01.922
Did you have anything
to do with this?

11:05.708 --> 11:08.145
Look at me and tell me
you had nothing to do

11:08.189 --> 11:09.190
with Henry Cole's death.
- Are you being serious?

11:09.233 --> 11:10.321
Yes, I am.

11:12.149 --> 11:15.152
Pearl, the guy
had been drinking

11:15.196 --> 11:18.112
straight out of the bottle
for a solid week.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.070
He got drunk.
He fell off the balcony.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.942
Gravity took over.
How could you possibly think

11:21.985 --> 11:23.334
that I would have anything
to do with this?

11:23.378 --> 11:25.162
You know how.

11:36.826 --> 11:40.134
You are all of my heart,

11:40.177 --> 11:41.744
all of it.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.398
And I would never do anything

11:43.441 --> 11:47.358
that would jeopardize our
marriage or your trust in me.

11:47.402 --> 11:51.928
Not even the damn casino
is as important to me as

11:51.972 --> 11:55.192
you are,
I swear that to God.

11:55.236 --> 11:58.500
And I swear to God,
if you put us in jeopardy...

12:07.161 --> 12:08.336
So you tripled the arrests

12:08.379 --> 12:10.338
of anyone else
in your squad, huh?

12:10.381 --> 12:12.470
My squad was out
in Belle Harbor.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.908
It's the boonies.
It doesn't count.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.736
If you're dealing
with live bullets, it counts.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.783
I guess I'm looking
for more action.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.785
In Organized Crime?

12:22.829 --> 12:25.396
You get more of that
in Narcotics or the Gang Unit.

12:27.877 --> 12:28.878
Why are you here?

12:31.925 --> 12:34.101
I don't like bullies.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.277
They steal your lunch money,
and they copy your homework,

12:36.320 --> 12:38.192
and then they beat
the crap out of you anyway

12:38.235 --> 12:40.324
just for the hell of it, and
that's all organized crime is.

12:40.368 --> 12:43.066
All those guys out there,
they're bullies,

12:43.110 --> 12:46.417
just making life harder
for ordinary people.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.855
It's what makes
the brotherhood,

12:48.898 --> 12:53.294
cops posing as good guys,
even worse.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.948
And I don't like 'em.

13:11.007 --> 13:12.966
Oh, Ayanna, come in.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.490
We've already started
talking about custody.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.408
OK, wow.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.454
Denise, can I just talk to you
for a minute?

13:23.498 --> 13:25.500
In private?

13:38.600 --> 13:41.037
Um, are we actually doing this?

13:41.081 --> 13:42.647
What were you expecting?

13:42.691 --> 13:46.651
I expect you to stop
punishing me for doing my job.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.566
Well, you had two jobs,

13:48.610 --> 13:51.308
and you abandoned being a wife
and being a mother.

13:51.352 --> 13:52.614
That's work too.
- OK.

13:52.657 --> 13:55.138
I can't do that work
if you won't let me.

13:55.182 --> 13:57.967
I mean, you moved in
with your sister who hates me.

13:58.011 --> 14:00.840
You won't return my calls,
my texts.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.932
D, it's me.

14:05.975 --> 14:08.325
OK? Come on.

14:08.369 --> 14:11.154
Don't just throw this away.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.940
We don't need lawyers.
We can do this on our own.

14:16.029 --> 14:18.379
Our life is not
a case to crack, Ayanna.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.471
Now sit your ass down.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.432
We're getting a divorce.

14:59.637 --> 15:02.553
No sign of forced entry.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.555
Empty bottle of rum
on the fire escape.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.557
Guy just lost his balance
and fell.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.081
An accident,
just like they said.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.214
Have you processed it?

15:11.258 --> 15:12.520
Detectives came and went.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.130
They just left me
to safeguard it.

15:14.174 --> 15:16.437
Big rush.

15:16.480 --> 15:19.179
We'll need
a full forensics team in here.

15:19.222 --> 15:21.268
Run a Touch DNA on everything.
- Got it.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.748
You really want
to Bigfoot this?

15:23.792 --> 15:26.577
I'm pretty good
with the fallout.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.408
Not the only rat in here.

15:35.978 --> 15:36.936
What did you say?

15:39.112 --> 15:40.374
Watch your mouth.
Do you know

15:40.417 --> 15:41.244
who you're talking to?
- And who are you?

15:41.288 --> 15:42.376
Detective. Detective.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.074
Wait for me in the hallway.

15:56.129 --> 15:57.478
We'll be back.

15:57.521 --> 16:00.611
Make sure nobody else
tramples on through here.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.700
We're looking
into this full-on.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.139
Is that clear?

16:07.531 --> 16:09.229
Yes, sir.

16:20.066 --> 16:23.025
Don't ever fight
my battles for me.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.680
It's not just your battle.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.725
It's the reason I asked
to join this unit.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.295
Dirty cops are
the worst kind of cops.

16:32.339 --> 16:34.732
They make good cops' lives
harder and more dangerous.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.529
Gimme a sec.

16:54.665 --> 16:57.494
Excuse me, miss.

16:57.538 --> 17:00.062
Are they making you
take down that shrine?

17:00.106 --> 17:01.107
They're telling me
they're gonna

17:01.150 --> 17:02.282
tear down the building already.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.370
No.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.373
My dad lived there 40 years,

17:06.416 --> 17:08.592
and now it's like
none of it matters.

17:08.636 --> 17:10.246
Well, it matters to me.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.683
My name is
Detective Elliot Stabler.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.512
And that building
is a crime scene.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.340
- A crime scene?
- A crime scene.

17:17.384 --> 17:18.863
And until my partner and I
figure out

17:18.907 --> 17:21.257
what really happened, no one
is touching that building.

17:23.694 --> 17:26.306
Are you telling me that you
think someone murdered my dad?

17:26.349 --> 17:29.178
I don't know,
but we're gonna find out.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.137
No, no.

17:34.357 --> 17:36.229
Your father deserves
to rest in peace.

17:36.272 --> 17:37.621
And you deserve to rest easy.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.362
So we're gonna get
to the answers, OK?

17:39.406 --> 17:40.842
Watch out!

17:48.545 --> 17:50.156
Hey, guys,
you're not wearing hard hats.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.769
A construction site
is a dangerous place.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.736
- Truman.
- Stabler.

18:06.476 --> 18:06.781
What have we got?

18:07.260 --> 18:08.174
Cause of death:

18:09.262 --> 18:12.656
fracture to the cervical
spine vertebrae C1 and C2.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.702
Mr. Cole died upon impact.

18:14.745 --> 18:15.877
Foul play?

18:15.920 --> 18:18.140
No sign of physical injury.

18:18.184 --> 18:21.056
But his BAC was 0.18,
well into the blackout zone.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.362
We know he was drinking.

18:22.405 --> 18:23.667
Can't say if he was pushed,

18:23.711 --> 18:25.800
but his balance
and his judgment

18:25.843 --> 18:27.715
were severely impaired
at time of death.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.195
Anything else?

18:29.238 --> 18:30.587
Rat bites.

18:32.850 --> 18:33.851
Dozens of them.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.855
Based on the presence of sepsis
in the bloodstream,

18:37.899 --> 18:39.379
they were inflicted premortem.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.772
That's an old mafia tactic.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.383
Bring in the rats
to get you out.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.167
Not necessarily.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.909
New York City's rat population
exploded during the pandemic.

18:47.952 --> 18:50.216
They're especially prevalent
at construction sites.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.131
There's no hard evidence.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.741
They want me
to determine cause of death.

18:53.784 --> 18:56.787
Right now,
it's looking like accidental.

18:56.831 --> 18:59.225
Declare a CUPPI.

18:59.268 --> 19:01.009
Wait on the tox report
for the rat bites.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.404
I can delay my report
48 hours,

19:04.447 --> 19:06.928
but the rest
of the investigation

19:06.971 --> 19:08.103
is out of my hands.

19:11.759 --> 19:12.934
Thanks, Tru.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.287
Any word on processing
Henry's apartment?

19:18.331 --> 19:19.723
No.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.161
Are we gonna to move?

19:22.204 --> 19:23.945
Waiting on Sarge.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.729
How are we gonna trust that
the crime scene stays clean?

19:25.773 --> 19:26.774
I just don't
have the answers,

19:26.817 --> 19:28.776
so you gotta stop asking
for now.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.299
What have you got?

19:30.343 --> 19:32.171
Henry was
the last holdout, right?

19:32.214 --> 19:33.389
Yes.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.738
I'm wondering
who in the building

19:34.782 --> 19:36.871
was second to last or third.

19:36.914 --> 19:38.002
Why?

19:38.046 --> 19:39.178
Maybe
they were threatened too.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.744
That's good.

19:40.788 --> 19:41.789
It should be easy enough
to get the tenant list.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.138
Go at it.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.880
- Then there's the rats.
- OK.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.925
The bites were unusual,
full of sepsis.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.144
Yeah.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.319
These grad students
at Hudson U

19:50.363 --> 19:51.755
did a comprehensive study

19:51.799 --> 19:53.235
of New York City rats
during lockdown.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.455
Maybe we could give them
some tissue samples,

19:55.498 --> 19:57.283
see if they can
give their take.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.110
You want me
to have the ME send

19:59.154 --> 20:01.765
Henry Cole's tissue samples
over to some grad students?

20:01.809 --> 20:03.332
Look, I can vouch for them.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.682
Kind of a fan girl.

20:05.726 --> 20:06.814
Of the rat guys?

20:06.857 --> 20:08.207
Of their research.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.947
What the hell,
I'll make the call.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.949
You know, what have
we got to lose, right?

20:25.180 --> 20:26.921
How come
I haven't heard from you?

20:26.964 --> 20:28.836
You tell me to fix the problem,
I get the job done.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.272
Hey, hey,
watch what you say.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.447
The less I know,
the better,

20:31.491 --> 20:33.188
especially
when it comes to business.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.844
I just thought,
you know, you'd be proud.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.106
I mean, you know,
we're back on schedule.

20:38.149 --> 20:39.716
Oh, damn.

20:39.760 --> 20:43.067
And here I left my gold star
stickers in the car.

20:43.111 --> 20:44.243
What can I do
to make it up to you?

20:44.286 --> 20:46.157
- Dad.
- "Dad" is the guy

20:46.201 --> 20:48.290
who changed your diapers
and paid for boarding school.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.900
I'm the head of this company,

20:49.944 --> 20:51.424
and you are
my second in command.

20:51.467 --> 20:54.296
All I expect from you
is results.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.908
You want praise, get it from
your Insta model of a wife.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.040
Stop calling her that.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.868
I'll call her
anything I want.

21:00.911 --> 21:02.261
And you need
to grow the hell up.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.269
Yes, sir.

21:13.359 --> 21:16.275
Look, I'm hard on you
because I love you, son.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.843
You'll thank me for it later.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.282
Hell, you should thank me now.

21:27.068 --> 21:28.417
Thank you, sir.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.901
You're a good man.

21:33.944 --> 21:37.861
So maybe get me a grandkid
one of these days, huh?

21:40.211 --> 21:43.084
I always wanted a Robert Jr.
in the family.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.231
So we tracked the differences

22:00.275 --> 22:03.017
between uptown rats
and downtown rats,

22:03.060 --> 22:04.410
even East Village
from West Village.

22:04.453 --> 22:06.281
It's all
about DNA sequencing.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.284
Do you remember the
NYC pizza rat that went viral?

22:09.328 --> 22:11.504
Everyone thought
he was from the East Village.

22:11.547 --> 22:14.115
He actually commuted
from the Upper West Side.

22:14.158 --> 22:16.291
That's so cool, Miles.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.119
What kind of rat
bit Henry Cole?

22:18.162 --> 22:19.468
Well, this is
where it gets interesting.

22:19.512 --> 22:21.427
It wasn't a New York variety,

22:21.470 --> 22:23.951
which are predominantly
brown rats, Rattus norvegicus.

22:23.994 --> 22:26.083
These were
black African crested rats,

22:26.127 --> 22:27.824
the only rodents
who create their own poison.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.435
They don't exist in New York.

22:29.478 --> 22:32.351
So someone had to buy them.
Where would they do that?

22:34.918 --> 22:36.137
Oh, we don't know.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.357
So where'd you get these?

22:43.492 --> 22:46.277
Just tell us, guys.

22:47.583 --> 22:51.108
An illegal site
from an African vendor.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.154
Were they picked up?
Delivered?

22:53.197 --> 22:54.460
We can't tell you that.

22:54.503 --> 22:55.896
These people
could be dangerous.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.593
All right.
Look, guys.

22:57.637 --> 22:59.421
We're investigating
a murder here.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.031
You don't want
to obstruct justice,

23:01.075 --> 23:02.076
because then
I'd have to cuff you,

23:02.119 --> 23:03.207
bring you to Rikers Island.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.341
I mean,
there's a lot of rats there,

23:06.385 --> 23:08.474
but I don't think
you'll be comfortable.

23:11.085 --> 23:12.478
You leave me with no choice.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.088
Wait, wait, wait.
It's in the Bronx.

23:14.131 --> 23:15.568
- Simon.
- I'm sorry.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.182
OK.

23:21.225 --> 23:22.531
Yes, thank you.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.450
Denise?

23:28.494 --> 23:30.670
- Do you respect me, Elliot?
- What?

23:30.713 --> 23:32.498
Do you respect me?

23:32.541 --> 23:34.325
Of course I do.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.240
Then why didn't you
follow my orders?

23:37.633 --> 23:38.982
What does that mean?

23:39.026 --> 23:40.636
You opened up
an investigation

23:40.680 --> 23:42.333
on Henry Cole's death

23:42.377 --> 23:44.988
when I told you
to check in with me first.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.642
- Who told you that?
- No, no, no, no.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.385
You're not asking me questions.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.519
I'm asking you questions.

23:53.562 --> 23:55.695
Now, we have been
down this road before.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.653
I will not be undermined.

23:57.697 --> 24:00.047
Is that clear?
- Very clear.

24:02.223 --> 24:05.313
I had two days before the
ME's report was gonna come out.

24:05.356 --> 24:06.662
And I told you to wait.

24:12.102 --> 24:14.409
Elliott.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.672
Everything that has to do
with this casino

24:16.716 --> 24:18.544
is political dynamite.

24:18.587 --> 24:23.157
It has to be handled
with tact, strategy.

24:23.200 --> 24:24.463
Those aren't exactly
my strong suits.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.942
Well, they are mine.

24:27.335 --> 24:29.250
Whatever we do,
we have to do it together.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.513
Agreed?
- Agreed.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.167
I'm sorry.

24:35.169 --> 24:37.214
Sarge?

24:37.258 --> 24:38.346
We've got something.

24:41.610 --> 24:44.091
So you're telling me
that our working theory

24:44.134 --> 24:46.136
is that they killed Henry Cole
with rats?

24:46.180 --> 24:47.442
It was indicated
in the ME report.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.488
Yes,
this breed is poisonous,

24:49.531 --> 24:52.012
and we believe that someone
placed them on the scene.

24:52.055 --> 24:54.014
This is the site where they
were most likely purchased.

24:54.057 --> 24:56.451
- Are they a legal vendor?
- No, dark web.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.757
These unregulated
online markets

24:57.800 --> 25:00.107
have exploded
in the past few years.

25:00.150 --> 25:02.631
Buying elephant ivory,
tiger cubs, pangolin--

25:02.675 --> 25:04.285
it's as easy
as click and pay now.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.591
Do we know who's behind this?

25:05.634 --> 25:07.288
The guy's located up
in Highbridge.

25:07.331 --> 25:08.681
We want to brace him,

25:08.724 --> 25:10.596
see if he sold any African rats
in the past week.

25:10.639 --> 25:13.381
Might lead us to a suspect.

25:13.424 --> 25:15.426
So do we need clearance
from anyone,

25:15.470 --> 25:16.689
or are we ready to roll?

25:19.082 --> 25:21.563
If this is a murder, somebody
needs to answer for it.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.131
Let's roll.

25:32.661 --> 25:35.795
I was thinking, uh...

25:36.839 --> 25:37.753
you know,
maybe Denise is right.

25:39.842 --> 25:42.541
All I ever had time for
was my career.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.241
God, is it worth it?

25:50.810 --> 25:53.682
Well, all I can tell you
is I was married a long time,

25:53.726 --> 25:56.772
and I used to ask myself that
very same question every day.

25:56.816 --> 26:00.559
And, you know,
if I'm being honest...

26:03.562 --> 26:06.303
The only reason it lasted
was Kathy made it work.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.659
Crap husband.

26:13.702 --> 26:15.965
Are you admitting that?

26:16.009 --> 26:18.272
I will if you admit
to being a crap wife.

26:20.187 --> 26:22.711
- We suck.
- We're the worst.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.758
Oh.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.803
Look on the bright side.
We still got our job, right?

26:27.847 --> 26:29.631
I mean, where else
can you drive up to the Bronx

26:29.675 --> 26:30.806
with a good friend
and get paid for it?

26:30.850 --> 26:32.329
Right.

26:32.373 --> 26:33.853
Living the dream.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.554
Living the dream.

26:50.696 --> 26:54.700
Doesn't exactly look like
Ringling Brothers from here.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.180
You jinxed it.

27:12.979 --> 27:13.980
You wanna go in there
and check it out?

27:14.023 --> 27:14.937
Hell no.

27:42.791 --> 27:45.185
Yo, in the bushes, NYPD!
Come on out!

27:47.709 --> 27:49.406
We're not here about
your little operation.

27:49.450 --> 27:50.712
We want to ask you
a few questions

27:50.756 --> 27:52.366
about a customer of yours.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.063
Come on, let's go.
Come on out.

27:56.370 --> 27:59.721
Look, pal,
we can do it two ways:

27:59.765 --> 28:01.897
easy way,
or I call animal welfare.

28:01.941 --> 28:03.159
What do you say?
Let's go.

28:03.203 --> 28:04.639
Don't call.

28:10.689 --> 28:14.040
I just put down a big deposit
for some land upstate

28:14.083 --> 28:16.085
for a real preserve.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.739
Go legit, you know?

28:17.783 --> 28:20.089
I want to give these animals
space to roam.

28:20.133 --> 28:22.701
Buatsi's
a Ghanaian surname, right?

28:24.093 --> 28:25.268
But that's South African rand.

28:25.312 --> 28:27.053
Where are you
getting these animals?

28:27.096 --> 28:30.839
That information wasn't part
of the arrangement, hmm?

28:30.883 --> 28:35.409
Ah, I sold some African crested
rats to this man last week.

28:35.452 --> 28:37.977
He didn't give a name.
Paid in cash.

28:39.456 --> 28:41.894
I'm telling the truth, I swear.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.417
- It could be our guy.
- Mm-hmm.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.374
We need that footage.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.423
- It's all here.
- So anything else comes up,

28:49.466 --> 28:51.947
you're gonna
give me a call, right?

28:51.991 --> 28:53.732
Yeah.

29:05.787 --> 29:08.224
Look at that view.

29:08.268 --> 29:09.791
Oh, hey.

29:09.835 --> 29:10.966
I'm almost done.

29:12.707 --> 29:13.447
No, you're done now.

29:18.495 --> 29:21.324
I need your eyes on me.
I need you to listen.

29:21.368 --> 29:22.369
It's serious.

29:36.470 --> 29:39.168
I was devastated

29:39.212 --> 29:41.954
that you thought

29:41.997 --> 29:45.435
that I was capable
of planning a murder.

29:45.479 --> 29:49.135
It made me sick
to my stomach.

29:49.178 --> 29:51.833
And then it hit me,

29:51.877 --> 29:55.750
that I am married
to the most...

29:55.794 --> 29:58.927
beautiful woman

29:58.971 --> 30:02.148
in all of New York City,

30:02.191 --> 30:04.890
that you emanate light,

30:04.933 --> 30:08.458
that you are my light...

30:08.502 --> 30:12.201
and that you must shine.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.814
Wow, Teddy.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.380
This is beautiful.

30:26.955 --> 30:29.218
How many carats?

30:29.262 --> 30:32.047
Well, your last one was five,

30:32.091 --> 30:35.181
so I made this one six.

30:35.224 --> 30:36.573
You remembered?

30:36.617 --> 30:39.098
No, I never forget.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.273
There's a difference.

30:47.323 --> 30:48.498
You OK?

30:50.196 --> 30:53.503
I had our publicist
draft up a speech.

30:53.547 --> 30:56.332
I wanted to start a scholarship
fund in Henry's name.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.160
- Mm-hmm.
- And this ring

30:58.204 --> 31:01.163
could literally fund an
entire school for needy kids.

31:07.996 --> 31:09.955
But it's pretty spectacular.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.960
I think
what you're trying to say is,

31:15.003 --> 31:17.832
"How could I
possibly thank you?"

31:38.418 --> 31:39.941
Want to go inside?

31:41.508 --> 31:43.553
We own this city.

31:43.597 --> 31:45.904
Let's let 'em watch.

32:07.403 --> 32:08.535
That's it?
That's the only view?

32:11.451 --> 32:12.408
Space.

32:12.452 --> 32:14.628
Sorry.

32:14.671 --> 32:15.846
That's the best
we're gonna get.

32:19.111 --> 32:20.982
I thought I heard a buzzer.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.766
It's the electrician.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.986
OK, we're waiting
on Bobby Reyes.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.032
1PP sent him over to interview.

32:27.075 --> 32:30.644
He was at UC for four years
in Anti-Crime, three in Narco.

32:30.687 --> 32:31.819
Never got made.

32:31.862 --> 32:32.994
They call him
the Invisible Man.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.474
And he's late.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.519
He can't get
any more invisible than that.

32:36.563 --> 32:39.131
You wanna move your chair
so I can get back there?

32:39.174 --> 32:41.785
And you might want to zoom in
on the coffee cup.

32:44.092 --> 32:45.833
Excuse me?

32:45.876 --> 32:47.487
His right hand.
There should be a name on it.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.449
"Kenny."

32:53.493 --> 32:55.930
The Invisible Man
just appeared.

32:55.974 --> 32:56.975
Bobby Reyes.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.153
Nice to meet you, Sergeant.

33:01.196 --> 33:02.850
Mm.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.026
There's still steam
coming from the cup. Jet?

33:05.070 --> 33:07.898
Closest Starbucks is four
blocks away, near Highbridge.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.683
You two make a call
over there,

33:09.726 --> 33:11.728
find out if he was dumb enough
to pay with a credit card.

33:13.861 --> 33:16.864
Bobby Reyes,

33:16.907 --> 33:17.908
let's talk.

33:22.913 --> 33:25.525
So that's what you guys
were chasing down?

33:25.568 --> 33:26.787
Good.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.616
Henry's death
seemed strange to me too.

33:29.659 --> 33:31.879
You see,
that's a real investigation.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.881
All I've been doing
is buy-and-busts.

33:33.924 --> 33:35.056
Perps are back on the street

33:35.100 --> 33:36.623
before we even done
with paperwork.

33:36.666 --> 33:37.972
Well,
we have our challenges too.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.060
Trust me.

33:39.104 --> 33:41.541
But it's the right work.

33:41.584 --> 33:44.935
Look, you can put me
anywhere, all right?

33:44.979 --> 33:47.068
Falafel truck,
bike messenger,

33:47.112 --> 33:50.071
bus boy, homeless guy--
it doesn't matter.

33:50.115 --> 33:52.595
I'm the guy
America doesn't see.

33:52.639 --> 33:54.075
How'd you get in here today?

33:54.119 --> 33:55.729
Simple.

33:55.772 --> 33:58.079
I pretended to be the captain,
faked a work order.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.560
Took about ten minutes.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.040
What you got?

34:02.083 --> 34:04.042
He was off guard
at the Starbucks.

34:04.085 --> 34:06.827
Camera caught his face, and we
were able to follow his trail.

34:06.870 --> 34:10.657
Suspect's name is
Kenneth Michael Kyle, age 31.

34:10.700 --> 34:11.919
Career criminal.

34:11.962 --> 34:14.095
Arson, assault,
auto theft,

34:14.139 --> 34:15.879
larceny, extortion--
a whole laundry list.

34:15.923 --> 34:17.098
Mob affiliations?

34:17.142 --> 34:18.926
Not that we could tell.

34:18.969 --> 34:21.146
But I haven't started
cross-referencing yet.

34:21.189 --> 34:23.017
- Do you have an address?
- Gravesend.

34:24.627 --> 34:25.976
You want to take a ride?

34:42.863 --> 34:45.170
Ma'am!

34:45.213 --> 34:47.215
Was that ambulance leaving
from Kenny Kyle's house?

34:47.259 --> 34:48.782
Yeah, that was Kenny.

34:48.825 --> 34:50.175
Mind telling us
what happened?

34:50.218 --> 34:52.133
He was having some
kind of seizure on the lawn,

34:52.177 --> 34:53.613
foaming at the mouth,
leg twitching.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.049
I called 911.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.616
They took him
to Brookside Hospital.

34:56.659 --> 34:57.965
OK, thank you for your help.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.194
Hi, we're looking
for a suspect.

35:09.237 --> 35:11.196
White male, 30s,
blond hair,

35:11.239 --> 35:12.936
goes by the name of Kenny Kyle.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.199
Rat bite guy?

35:14.242 --> 35:15.765
So he got bit?

35:15.809 --> 35:17.985
Yeah, he was admitted.

35:18.028 --> 35:19.987
Went into
full-blown septic shock.

35:20.030 --> 35:23.512
We got antibiotics in him right
before his organs shut down.

35:23.556 --> 35:26.646
So let's say
someone got bit 20 times--

35:26.689 --> 35:28.169
Without immediate
emergency care,

35:28.213 --> 35:30.606
I think he'd be dead
within hours.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.654
Where is he?
We need to talk to him.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.003
Sure, this way.

35:38.658 --> 35:40.181
OK, picture this.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.792
Henry was on his fire escape,
bottle of rum,

35:42.836 --> 35:44.838
pretty inebriated.

35:44.881 --> 35:47.580
But all of a sudden,
he's attacked by rats.

35:47.623 --> 35:50.017
He reels back, loses
his balance, and falls over.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.585
Yeah, I think the bites
were intended as the weapon,

35:52.628 --> 35:54.195
but the fall was a bonus.

35:55.849 --> 35:58.199
Mr. Kyle?

35:58.243 --> 36:00.680
Some friends here to see...

36:00.723 --> 36:02.812
What the hell?

36:02.856 --> 36:05.250
Is this guy determined
to lose a kidney today?

36:05.293 --> 36:07.208
He was just here.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.775
Suspect on the move.

36:08.818 --> 36:10.168
OK, follow the cab.
We're on our way.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.487
Whoa,
the homeless shelter's on 38th,

36:25.531 --> 36:26.662
unless your name
is on that list.

36:26.706 --> 36:27.707
He's good.

36:42.069 --> 36:44.202
My advice, Teddy,
you and your wife

36:44.245 --> 36:46.508
shouldn't have been out there
making promises in public.

36:46.552 --> 36:47.683
We already made 'em
to the city.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.598
Remember?
It helped us secure the bid.

36:49.642 --> 36:53.472
Yeah, well, I made promises
to other people.

36:53.515 --> 36:55.343
And they're very upset.

36:58.259 --> 37:00.522
We got a lot of eyes on us
right now, Vincent.

37:00.566 --> 37:01.741
It's not the time
to cut corners.

37:01.784 --> 37:03.351
Corners?

37:03.395 --> 37:05.745
I'm thinking about throats.

37:29.682 --> 37:32.119
OK, you two,
you get out there, cut a rug.

37:32.162 --> 37:33.555
Keep an eye on Kenny.
Don't get made.

37:33.599 --> 37:34.861
"Cut a rug"?

37:34.904 --> 37:37.429
Yeah, that's old people slang
for dance.

37:37.472 --> 37:39.779
- Oh, I don't--
- Orders are orders.

37:43.217 --> 37:44.566
- You should run for mayor.
- Oh.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.525
No, I'm serious.
She could do it.

37:46.568 --> 37:49.702
- Your drinks, Ms. Pearl?
- Yes, thank you.

37:49.745 --> 37:51.269
Yes, future mayor hanging out

37:51.312 --> 37:54.315
with two degenerates
like you guys?

37:54.359 --> 37:55.838
<i>- Chin-chin.</i>
- Cheers.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.414
Bobby,
stay by the main entrance.

38:06.458 --> 38:07.763
Copy that.

38:11.637 --> 38:14.466
I got him.
He's looking for someone.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.643
Can't lose him.

38:47.760 --> 38:49.631
<i>Upstairs.
VIP area.</i>

38:49.675 --> 38:50.850
I got eyes on him.
He's on the move.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.462
Jamie, slow down.

38:58.423 --> 38:59.859
He made you.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.435
Aah!

39:10.478 --> 39:11.827
Jamie!

39:11.871 --> 39:13.568
Emergency exit
behind the stairs.

39:13.612 --> 39:14.874
On my way.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.447
Aah!

39:22.490 --> 39:23.709
You all right?

39:27.452 --> 39:28.931
Are you crazy?
You could have been hit!

39:30.542 --> 39:32.631
Aah! No, no!

39:43.859 --> 39:45.731
Stabler!

39:45.774 --> 39:49.430
I need a APB
on a stolen black Chevy Cruze.

39:49.474 --> 39:52.825
New York plate,
King-Mike-Boy-2561.

39:52.868 --> 39:54.392
- I'm good.
- There's a BOLO

39:54.435 --> 39:56.524
at every exit
off the West Side Highway.

39:56.568 --> 39:58.526
A straight line,
nowhere to hide.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.702
And he's getting sicker.

40:00.746 --> 40:02.356
He's gonna need help soon.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.402
Yeah, we're gonna get him.

40:06.926 --> 40:08.275
What about the ME report?

40:08.318 --> 40:10.059
Henry Cole's death...

40:10.103 --> 40:12.671
was a homicide.
