WEBVTT

00:50.718 --> 00:52.720
You didn't even
use your teeth.

00:52.753 --> 00:56.224
Teeth? What are these
"teeth" you speak of?

00:56.257 --> 00:59.093
I think he's talking about
our smile bones, brah.

00:59.127 --> 01:01.462
Man, who calls
smile bones "teeth."

01:01.495 --> 01:03.697
People who don't know
how to eat, that's who.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.533
Savoring each bite. Ugh.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.835
Chewing the big pieces
and the small pieces.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.337
It's disgusting.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.139
You're just inhaling
your food.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.407
This is inhaling
your food, mama.

01:15.276 --> 01:18.078
Ooh, I wish to try
the eat breath.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.185
Disgusting.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.386
Not bad, Star.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.854
Just remember
the point of eating

01:26.887 --> 01:28.256
is getting as much food

01:28.289 --> 01:30.458
into your belly
as fast as possible.

01:30.491 --> 01:31.292
No, it's not.

01:31.325 --> 01:34.195
The point is to savor
every bite.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.864
Food does not
just give us life. It is life.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.133
Besides, you don't want
to end up with a...

01:39.167 --> 01:40.734
Belly.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.237
MALE VOICE:
What's wrong with
a beautiful belly, friend?

01:43.271 --> 01:45.206
What

01:45.239 --> 01:46.674
-I do!

01:46.707 --> 01:49.477
Your belly talk's a bunch
of malarkey and you know it.

01:49.510 --> 01:52.180
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy there, belly.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.881
Now, that's disgusting.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.483
Disgusting?

01:55.516 --> 01:59.287
Don't you call that proud
round mound disgusting.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.889
Greetings, Cyborg's
and Beast Boy's midsections.

02:01.922 --> 02:04.192
I have nine of the stomachs

02:04.225 --> 02:05.726
but none of them speak.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.428
They're just squishing
their fat around

02:07.461 --> 02:08.896
to make them seem
like they're talking, Star.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.798
Who you calling fat, Shorty?

02:10.831 --> 02:13.401
I'm the average height
for a male of my age!

02:13.434 --> 02:15.936
And be warned, you might be
speaking for your belly now,

02:15.969 --> 02:19.407
but if you're not careful,
one day it will speak for you.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.443
-Sounds like more
malarkey, buster.
-Enough!

02:22.476 --> 02:24.578
I want you two
to take small bites.

02:24.612 --> 02:25.679
Enjoy your food.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.282
And most importantly,
use your teeth when you eat.

02:28.316 --> 02:30.784
They are called
smile bones, okay?

02:30.818 --> 02:33.921
And we're not the ones
who need to learn how to eat.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.389
Not us.

02:35.423 --> 02:38.426
But go ahead...

02:38.459 --> 02:41.795
Try to enjoy your food
if you can, friend.

03:14.027 --> 03:17.965
Oh, look at these
big old bellies.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.867
So round and shiny.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.836
You fellows
sure do take good care of us.

03:22.870 --> 03:26.940
Yes, we won't forget this
when we take over the world.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.545
-Take over the world,
good one!
-Oh, man.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.484
We need food.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.752
-Please!

03:38.786 --> 03:40.854
Here you go.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.424
That looks delicious.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.626
I can't wait to sink
my teeth into it.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.761
I'm going to enjoy
this so much.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.801
You see where you went wrong?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.503
You were savoring your food

03:55.536 --> 03:56.904
before you even took a bite.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.407
Y'all eat too slow!

03:59.440 --> 04:02.310
Cyborg, Beast Boy,
I was wrong to doubt you.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.044
I'm ready to learn
how to eat the right way.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.480
Wait, Raven!
Remember my belly warning.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.015
I am ready as well.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.917
Let's not make
any hasty decisions.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.519
Consider the consequences.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.521
Are you ready to give up
control to your bellies

04:13.554 --> 04:15.055
-just because
of a little... Ow.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.724
Okay, what do we need to do?

04:18.559 --> 04:20.728
Okay, let me see
what we're working with.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.032
You call those bellies!
It's shameful.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.335
What do you have
to say for yourself?

04:27.368 --> 04:30.371
-Well, I for one...
-Not you! Your belly.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.039
Oh.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.975
I want to learn
how to eat the right way.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.644
What about you, six

04:36.677 --> 04:40.013
I'm up for the challenge, sir.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.082
You ready to get juicy,
tangerine?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.818
The belly still cannot speak.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.556
We have a lot of work
ahead of us.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.492
Well, first things first.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.861
Turn in your
smile bones, please.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.529
Just put them in the bucket.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.901
-You want to learn
how to eat or not?

05:02.470 --> 05:04.672
Will those be stored
in a sanitary manner?

05:04.705 --> 05:06.907
Yeah, I put them
in the bucket.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.308
Now, let's eat!

05:34.768 --> 05:37.438
Those bellies
are looking ripe.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.408
Here's your
smile bones back, y'all.
You earned it.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.746
Oh, that's not right.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.481
-This belongs to...
-This isn't mine.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.949
-And that goes to you.
-Thank you.

05:48.982 --> 05:52.420
Robin, have you considered
eating less of the fish?

05:52.453 --> 05:53.721
Noted.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.123
So what do you bellies
have to say now?

05:56.156 --> 05:58.392
Fill me with food.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.494
It's tummy time.

06:01.662 --> 06:05.032
Oh, your belly's
still not speaking, huh?

06:05.065 --> 06:07.601
No, the belly can speak.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.837
I'm loving this belly talk.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.739
Now get me more food!

06:11.772 --> 06:14.475
Why do we have to
get you more food

06:14.508 --> 06:16.143
In the world of the belly,

06:16.176 --> 06:18.546
biggest belly is in charge!

06:18.579 --> 06:21.615
And that is us.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.452
Fat chance, belly boys,

06:24.485 --> 06:26.554
I'm the biggest,
I should be in charge.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.922
It should be the majority rule

06:28.956 --> 06:30.458
and we are the many.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.993
-ROBIN: I'm the biggest belly.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.495
Enough, bellies!

06:34.528 --> 06:37.130
There's only one way
to settle this thing.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.767
That's right.
Time to belly up!

06:54.815 --> 06:57.851
Oh, I cannot do
the inhaling anymore.

06:57.885 --> 07:01.021
Our bellies weren't meant
to hold this much food.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.723
Ugh.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.825
I am an abomination.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.796
Ah. Thanks
for the belly laugh.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.198
Your tiny bellies
are amusing to me.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.701
Yes, brother,
their pathetic bellies

07:13.734 --> 07:16.069
only exist to serve us now.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.204
Whatever.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.741
Um... I didn't say that.
My belly did!

07:20.774 --> 07:23.711
Oh, right we get it,
your "belly" said it.

07:23.744 --> 07:26.647
No, really,
my belly said that!

07:26.680 --> 07:29.082
That's enough malarkey
out of you non-bellies.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.851
Mine, too!

07:33.253 --> 07:34.387
It's happening!

07:38.258 --> 07:39.560
What's happening?

07:39.593 --> 07:40.894
I warned you about this.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.830
You've given your bellies
too much power

07:42.863 --> 07:44.565
and now they've taken control.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.667
CYBORG'S BELLY:
Indeed, we have!

07:46.700 --> 07:50.871
Yes, brother, now let us
seek out more food.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.976
While they were
consuming the food,

07:56.009 --> 07:58.912
their obsession with eating
was consuming them.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.247
So profound.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.015
There's only
one way to fix this.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.585
They have to learn
how to enjoy their food.

08:04.618 --> 08:06.720
But before we can
take care of those bellies...

08:06.754 --> 08:09.489
We have to
take care of these.

08:51.632 --> 08:55.135
So much delicious food,
brother.

08:55.168 --> 08:58.906
Yes, this world will be
very easy to conquer.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.810
Bro, this is out of control!

09:02.843 --> 09:04.678
If only we savored our meals

09:04.712 --> 09:06.814
we wouldn't be
in this situation.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.351
It's time to teach
those bellies how to eat.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.053
Starfire, Raven!

09:13.086 --> 09:14.554
You know what to do.

09:25.365 --> 09:26.767
Nice try,

09:26.800 --> 09:28.736
but how will they savor
these delicious treats

09:28.769 --> 09:30.337
without their smile bones.

09:35.843 --> 09:38.812
Oh. They took our
smile bones, bro.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.649
How are we going
to savor our food now?

09:41.682 --> 09:42.883
Take ours.

09:46.854 --> 09:47.955
Oh, man!

09:47.988 --> 09:49.757
Do you eat anything
other than fish?

09:49.790 --> 09:51.892
Quick, Raven, give Beast Boy
your smile bones.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.061
Ew, no way. You do it, Star.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.864
Very well.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.937
Hmm. Mmm.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.678
That is so good!

10:10.711 --> 10:12.880
What are they doing?

10:12.913 --> 10:16.149
They're enjoying their food!

10:23.056 --> 10:24.892
No!

10:28.829 --> 10:31.264
No, don't do it.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.033
Oh, what a world.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.805
Well, I sincerely hope
we all learned a little bit

10:37.838 --> 10:39.973
about the importance
of savoring your food.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.308
We sure did.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.710
Thanks, Robin.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.211
There's just one more thing.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.947
Biggest belly is in charge!
