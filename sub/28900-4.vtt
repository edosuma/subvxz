<i> Raven's Home was filmed</i>
<i> in front of a live</i>
<i> studio audience.</i>

00:06.974 --> 00:10.275
-Hi. Yes.
-Hey, sweetie.
Aw, you're all packed.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.545
This is empty.

00:13.547 --> 00:18.283
Mom, that is my
"I'll get Dad to take me
on a shopping spree" bag.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.620
Nia, Nia, Nia.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.089
Don't forget about me.

00:24.091 --> 00:28.293
Also, Mom, I can't wait
to talk to Dad about
climate change.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.796
Did you know that Dallas
will be one of the cities
most affected?

00:30.798 --> 00:33.232
Sweetheart, I love you so much,

00:33.234 --> 00:35.734
but you lost me at "also."

00:36.637 --> 00:38.170
Woop-woop!
Aw, man!

00:38.172 --> 00:40.239
I am so excited for
Dad's new apartment.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.141
He always has
the coolest new devices.

00:42.143 --> 00:45.577
You know, experts say
that Dallas is gonna be
the tech capital of Texas.

00:45.579 --> 00:50.282
Maybe they should call it
"Tech-sauce."

00:52.553 --> 00:54.153
-Boo.
-Not your best.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.220
Booker:
No...

00:55.222 --> 00:57.089
Howdy.

00:57.091 --> 01:00.559
Figured you might need
a cowboy hat for Tech-sas.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.661
See, I like it
when she says it.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.197
You kids ready?
I'm about to take you
to the airport

01:05.199 --> 01:07.332
so your mom can get
a jump on Raven Time.

01:07.334 --> 01:10.436
Yas! Raven Time.

01:10.438 --> 01:16.608
That magical time when
I get to do a dream board
or start a puzzle

01:16.610 --> 01:19.078
or finish those designs
that have just been
piling up in the corner

01:19.080 --> 01:21.513
or, nothing at all. Why?

01:21.515 --> 01:23.282
Because it's Raven Time.
My time!

01:23.284 --> 01:26.418
All right,
folks, according
to my calculations,

01:26.420 --> 01:29.021
if we leave now we should
get you to the airport early.

01:29.023 --> 01:31.023
-All right.
-Okay. Cool.

01:31.025 --> 01:33.192
"Thanks, Levi."

01:33.194 --> 01:35.294
You're welcome, family.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.429
Thank you, Levi.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.799
Thank you. I love you guys.
I'm gonna miss you, okay?

01:40.801 --> 01:43.769
All right, I love you.
Muah. Kisses, kisses!

Yep! That's us.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.547
(Booker grunting)

03:01.549 --> 03:03.448
I slayed the dragon.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.783
I won the race.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.351
I saved the whales!

03:07.354 --> 03:08.620
Woo!

03:08.622 --> 03:10.489
So, are you guys enjoying

03:10.491 --> 03:12.157
chillin' at the "Dad Pad"?

03:12.159 --> 03:13.859
Well, I love the pad

03:13.861 --> 03:15.360
not feeling the name.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.995
What do you guys think
about this?

03:16.997 --> 03:19.998
Hey, Jenna.
What do you think
about the "Dad Pad"?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Jenna:
<i> It's totally rad.</i>

03:22.002 --> 03:23.635
-You're right.
-I still can't believe

03:23.637 --> 03:26.038
-you have a Jenna.
-Hey, what's a Jenna?

03:26.040 --> 03:27.339
It's a voice-activated
smart hub

03:27.341 --> 03:28.674
that controls
the whole house.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.075
-Right.
-Here, look.

03:30.077 --> 03:33.712
Hey Jenna, am I the coolest,
most handsome guy around?

03:34.381 --> 03:36.248
Jenna:
<i> As of 2018,</i>

03:36.250 --> 03:38.417
<i> that title belongs</i>
<i> to Idris Elba.</i>

03:40.421 --> 03:41.987
Idris!

03:43.857 --> 03:45.324
Hey, Dad.
I've been reading

03:45.326 --> 03:47.092
all of those articles
that you've been sending me.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.061
Did you read the one
that says that Dallas--

03:49.063 --> 03:52.064
Is gonna be one of the cities
most affected by climate change.

03:52.066 --> 03:54.833
Yeah, she may have mentioned it
a few billion times.

03:54.835 --> 03:58.570
I love that you are following
in my weather-loving footsteps.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.606
Speaking of footsteps,

04:00.608 --> 04:03.242
you know there's this
climate change march
downtown tonight.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.444
Already made us signs.
You in?

04:05.446 --> 04:06.778
Am I in?

04:06.780 --> 04:08.747
Well, has the global average
of sea levels risen

04:08.749 --> 04:11.350
nearly seven inches over
the past hundred years?

04:13.053 --> 04:14.286
The answer is yes.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.623
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.158
(clicks, screeches)
Okay.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.228
Tonight's the online
Fork-Knife tournament.

04:23.230 --> 04:26.465
It's the best
cooking/street fighting
game ever made.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.300
And Dad and I are gonna
defend our title.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.102
Already made us snacks.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.638
Oh...
I doubled-booked.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.307
¶ ¶

04:36.243 --> 04:38.777
Corner piece,
corner piece...

04:38.779 --> 04:40.279
Corn... chip.

04:40.281 --> 04:42.047
Mm! Raven Time.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.551
Levi, honey. I was doing
the laundry,

04:46.553 --> 04:50.088
and, um, well, I...
found this.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.757
My "I Heart Public Radio"
sweatshirt?

04:51.759 --> 04:53.125
What about it?

04:53.127 --> 04:55.294
Levi, be honest with me, okay?

04:56.263 --> 04:58.196
Are you donating again?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.300
Mom, it's no big deal.

05:01.302 --> 05:02.768
It is a big deal!

05:02.770 --> 05:04.636
Donating is something
adults do

05:04.638 --> 05:07.372
to convince others
they're good people.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.375
Wow, Mom... bleak.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.580
-Hey, Rae. You got a sec?
-Nope. Raven Time.

05:15.582 --> 05:18.417
-I'm worried about Levi.
-Well, I guess we're doing it.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.485
Ever since I got back
from the ship,

05:20.487 --> 05:23.255
I'm worried he's growing up
too fast, you know?

05:23.257 --> 05:25.691
Do you think me being
away for so long
broke my baby boy?

05:25.693 --> 05:27.526
Oh my goodness,
I did. I did!
I broke my baby boy!

05:27.528 --> 05:29.027
Chels, Chels, Chels.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.280
Calm down.
You're overreacting.

05:31.281 --> 05:33.532
(sighs) I don't know, Rae.
Donating is a gateway
to adulthood.

05:33.534 --> 05:37.102
We need to think of some
like cool, fun kid activities,

05:37.104 --> 05:38.670
you know,
to keep him young.

05:38.672 --> 05:41.707
Otherwise he's gonna
start playing bingo
with Gertrude in 2B.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.542
Well, I'm off to Gertie's!

05:45.379 --> 05:47.546
-Rae!
-No. Chels, Chels.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.980
Don't worry about it.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.016
We will come up
with something, okay?

05:51.018 --> 05:53.018
-Booker: Fork-Knife, Fork-Knife.
-Nia: March, march!

05:53.020 --> 05:55.554
-Fork-Knife.
Fork-Knife. Fork-Knife.
-March. March. March.

05:55.556 --> 05:58.223
-Fork-Knife. Fork-Knife.
-March.

05:58.225 --> 05:59.925
(shrieks)

05:59.927 --> 06:02.994
<i> Couldn't you call me</i>
<i> like a normal person?</i>

06:02.996 --> 06:04.963
<i> I'm purifying.</i>
<i> Raven Time!</i>

06:06.066 --> 06:08.400
<i> Something happened</i>
<i> with my schedule and now--</i>

06:08.402 --> 06:10.068
<i> Are you trying to tell me</i>
<i> you messed up?</i>

06:10.070 --> 06:11.470
<i> I doubled-booked some things</i>

06:11.471 --> 06:12.871
<i> and now the kids are fighting</i>
<i> about what we should do.</i>

06:12.873 --> 06:14.239
<i> Devon, really?</i>

06:14.241 --> 06:16.808
<i> You're calling me because</i>
<i> the kids are arguing?</i>

06:16.810 --> 06:18.176
<i> You haven't even had them</i>
<i> a whole day.</i>

06:18.178 --> 06:20.078
<i> Well, to be fair,</i>
<i> you know time zones--</i>

06:20.080 --> 06:21.713
<i> We're in the same time zone.</i>

06:23.050 --> 06:26.151
Well, I'm off to the park
with all this kids' stuff.

06:26.153 --> 06:29.287
Oh, Rae. Rae,
I was gonna ask,
where's the park?

06:30.724 --> 06:32.724
Devon, I can only help
one parent at a time.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.526
Oh! Oh!

06:34.528 --> 06:36.661
-(Chelsea chattering)
<i> -If you please</i>
<i> just figure it out.</i>

06:36.663 --> 06:39.564
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i> Have them take turns</i>
<i> or something.</i>

06:39.566 --> 06:41.099
<i> I gotta go, Raven Time!</i>

06:42.236 --> 06:43.869
-Fork-Knife. Fork-Knife.
-Sorry, can't hear you.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.104
-March. March--
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:46.106 --> 06:48.173
Here's what's gonna happen.

06:48.175 --> 06:51.243
We're gonna alternate
activities, that way
everyone is happy.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.778
Can I be happy first?

06:52.780 --> 06:54.413
How about we flip a coin?

06:54.415 --> 06:56.348
Jenna, flip a coin.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.116
-I call heads.
-Jenna: <i> Tails.</i>

06:58.118 --> 07:00.018
I like her.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.453
Idris!

07:11.231 --> 07:12.831
Puzzle, check.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.002
Pedicure, check.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.238
Oh! Oh, oh.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.809

07:25.145 --> 07:29.247
What? No.
No, not during
Raven Time! No!

07:29.249 --> 07:32.584
-'Sup, Ms. B?
-Hey, Tess. What do you need?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.252
My Internet is down,
so I was wondering--

07:34.254 --> 07:36.021
No, my pedi! My pedi! My pedi!

07:36.023 --> 07:39.558
...if I could binge
my favorite show
<i> Froth</i> over here.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.593
Um,<i> Froth?</i>
It sounds messy.

07:41.595 --> 07:45.630
No, no. F-R-O-T-H
stands for Fabulous
Rappers of the Hardwood.

07:45.632 --> 07:49.167
See, it's a show
about aspiring rapping
basketball players,

07:49.169 --> 07:50.969
just trying to have it all.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.238
Okay. All right,
all right, Tess.
You can watch your show.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.107
-Just don't distract me.
-Okay. Thanks, Ms. B.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.243
-(music playing on TV)
-Oh man, I love this theme song.

07:58.245 --> 08:01.346
Oh, you love it?
That means you've heard it,

-Anyway...

09:27.434 --> 09:31.336
Reminding you that you
can be hot but the Earth
shouldn't be.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.573
-Hashtag: Global warming.
-Global warming.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.274
(cell phone ringing)

09:37.177 --> 09:39.611
You know, I hope
you're happy, Nia.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.513
Now Dad and I won't be
able to defend our title.

09:41.515 --> 09:44.282
Oh. I can live with that.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.119
Bad news, honey.
There's a storm
headed this way

09:48.121 --> 09:49.220
and they need me
to cover it.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.256
But, Dad, what about the march?

09:51.258 --> 09:53.291
It's canceled.
I'm sorry, sweetie.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.093
The storm's so bad that
they're looking for volunteers,

09:55.095 --> 09:57.362
and there's a 60% chance
of high winds.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.202
There's a 90% chance
that I'm gonna cry tonight.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.973
Awkward.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.547
Booker:
Look, Nia, tonight doesn't
have to be a total bust.

10:15.549 --> 10:18.283
All that I wanted
to do in Dallas

10:18.285 --> 10:19.985
was to spend time with Dad,

10:19.987 --> 10:22.287
and show him how much
I care about the environment.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.089
You know? It's our
special thing together.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.490
Now it's ruined.

10:25.492 --> 10:28.159
Look, this is supposed
to be a vacation.

10:28.161 --> 10:31.062
So let's get vacating
and play this game.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.600
Booker, what exactly
do you need a vacation from?

10:35.602 --> 10:37.135
I mean, you're so...

10:38.672 --> 10:40.605
-vacuous.
-(gasps)

10:40.607 --> 10:43.842
Vacuous? How dare you.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.910
-Vacuous?
-Yeah.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.514
I don't know what
vacuous means...

10:49.516 --> 10:51.850
but I know it makes me tired.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.985
Like you and all your "causes."

10:55.288 --> 10:56.488
What are you talking about?

10:56.490 --> 10:59.157
Look, Nia,
I love you and all,

10:59.159 --> 11:01.292
but every week you're posting
about some new cause.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.528
Last week was recycling,

11:03.530 --> 11:05.196
this week is Climate Change.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.898
I mean, pick a lane.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.268
Activism is important to me!

11:10.270 --> 11:13.038
Yeah. The problem is you
don't actually do anything.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.040
I mean, you never get
your pretty little hands dirty.

11:15.042 --> 11:18.877
Activists act, Nia.
It's the first part
of the word.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.879
And all you do is post.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.048
(snapping)
You're a "post-avist."

11:23.850 --> 11:26.551
Well, at least I care
about something.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.286
You don't even care
about anything!

11:28.288 --> 11:30.221
Hello? Fork-Knife!

11:30.223 --> 11:32.290
¶ ¶

11:33.393 --> 11:35.293
Rapper (on TV):
<i> I'm just tryin' to have it all.</i>

11:35.295 --> 11:38.296
<i> Is it possible to ball</i>
<i> and hip and hop?</i>

11:38.298 --> 11:39.831
Whoa. This show is so good!

11:39.833 --> 11:41.900
I know. I know.
It's so good. Hey, listen.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.968
Come, come pay attention.
We only got a couple more
questions

11:43.970 --> 11:46.204
before we can get that
Sew-What 8000, okay?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.406
All right.
"In the season two finale,

11:48.408 --> 11:51.342
"what team did
The Fabulous Rappers
of the Hardwood defeat,

11:51.344 --> 11:52.944
to make it to the semi-finals?"

11:54.014 --> 11:55.513
(sighs)

11:55.515 --> 11:57.248
-That's a tough one.
-Tess, Tess...

11:57.250 --> 11:58.683
J.K. The answer's "B."

11:58.685 --> 12:00.985
-(phone chimes)
-(screaming, giggling)

12:00.987 --> 12:04.189
I love that you are
so into this show
because of me.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.558
I've never had anyone
to watch it with.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.259
Oh yeah, girl.
I love this show.
Pay attention.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.797
It's okay, sweetie.
No one's even gonna notice.

12:14.735 --> 12:18.103
Hey, guys. How was the--
Welt!

12:20.073 --> 12:22.107
If anyone needs me,
I'll be in the kitchen

12:22.109 --> 12:23.808
icing my head.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.277
Well, that's it for baseball.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.879
I just made things worse.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.948
I hurt my baby boy.

12:29.949 --> 12:32.016
Chels, you have to stop
forcing these kid activities
on him.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.952
-Just sit Levi down...
-Yeah.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.253
...and talk about your feelings.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.923
What? Talk with him
about my feels? No!

12:38.925 --> 12:41.392
No, Rae, that's way
too adult, you know?

12:41.394 --> 12:45.630
I just, I just need
to find the right
kid activity, you know?

12:45.632 --> 12:48.032
There's gotta be
something in here.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.268
Aha! Ha-ha!

12:50.270 --> 12:53.171
I'll go play fishing
with my son.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.476
How do you play fishing?

12:58.478 --> 13:00.545
¶ ¶

13:00.547 --> 13:04.249
Oh, you think you--
Oh, no! No.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.684
Come on, Nia.
Help a brother out.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.654
Actually, help
your brother out.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.725
Aw, are you over there
posting sad emojis

13:13.727 --> 13:15.660
'cause I dropped a major
truth bomb on you?

13:15.662 --> 13:17.295
You want a major
truth bomb, yeah?

13:17.297 --> 13:19.764
Well, you're gonna live with
Mom and Aunt Chelsea, forever.

13:19.766 --> 13:23.334
Ha! Joke's on you.
That sounds awesome.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.972
Dad, aren't you ruining
the ozone with that hair spray?

13:27.974 --> 13:33.278
Maybe, but I need my waves
to lay flat on camera.
(chuckles)

13:33.280 --> 13:34.813
According to
<i> Weatherman Weekly,</i>

13:34.815 --> 13:37.348
I'm the eighth hottest
weatherman in Dallas.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.150
(chuckling)

13:39.152 --> 13:43.154
Okay, Booker. I am not
gonna sit her and watch you
play video games all night.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.456
I'm going with Dad.
Dad, I want to help.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.125
Well, I don't know
if that's a good idea, honey.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.261
-I mean, it can get
serious out there.
-Dad.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.431
Please, please, okay?
I don't want to be
a "post-avist" anymore.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.334
Fine. But you have
to promise me
you'll stay in the truck.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.770
-Okay, yeah.
-Yeah, Nia. Good idea.

13:58.772 --> 14:00.972
Be a trucktivist.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.307
But just like
Dad's hair waves,

14:02.309 --> 14:03.942
you won't last
two seconds out there.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.877
Look here, son.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.213
I programmed all the details
of where I'm gonna be

14:08.215 --> 14:10.381
and the emergency
numbers in the Jenna
if you need anything.

14:10.383 --> 14:14.185
-Right, Jenna?
-Jenna: <i> I know all the numbers.</i>
<i> One, two...</i>

14:14.187 --> 14:17.121
<i> Three, four, five, six...</i>

14:17.123 --> 14:19.157
¶ ¶

14:19.159 --> 14:20.959
-(phone chimes)
-(gasping)

14:20.961 --> 14:22.160
Another question right.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.696
Ooh-ee!
The adrenaline!

14:24.698 --> 14:26.197
Score. Okay.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.633
Quick bathroom break.
Holla at me if they start
the last question.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.535
Yeah, I'll holla. I'll holla.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.410
I fell into the water.

14:41.147 --> 14:44.148
Yeah, uh, the bait was
heavier than he was.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.152
At least the cold water
reduced...

14:48.154 --> 14:49.587
(shouts): the welt!

14:51.157 --> 14:52.357
Rae, come on.
I need your help.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.692
No. I can't help.
I got one more question.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.228
Tess is gonna help me
get this machine,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.097
then she can go home,

14:59.099 --> 15:01.399
and then I can get back
to Raven Time.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.035
What?

15:06.206 --> 15:07.639
You're just using me?

15:08.441 --> 15:11.109
No, no, Tess.
I'm not using you.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.311
I'm choosing you...

15:14.948 --> 15:17.015
to help me...

15:17.017 --> 15:19.784
win the Sew-What 8000.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.855
Come on, Levi.
Just one more activity, huh?

15:23.857 --> 15:25.857
Uh, I'm a little tied up.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.693
This hurts, Ms. B.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.862
I'm out.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.166
I'm never playing
fishing again.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.712
¶ ¶

15:47.714 --> 15:51.215
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Ah!

15:53.320 --> 15:54.886
Too bad nobody's here
to see it.

15:56.222 --> 15:58.056
(thunder cracking)

15:58.058 --> 16:00.458
Hey, Jenna.
How far away is that storm?

16:00.460 --> 16:04.028
Jenna:
<i> The storm is currently</i>
<i> 50 miles away,</i>

16:04.030 --> 16:06.998
<i> 49 miles, 48 miles,</i>

16:07.000 --> 16:08.399
<i> 47 miles,</i>

16:08.401 --> 16:10.134
<i> 46 miles...</i>

16:10.136 --> 16:12.303

16:12.305 --> 16:14.339
(whimpers)

16:14.341 --> 16:16.007
(whooshing)

16:16.009 --> 16:19.110
<i> ...45 miles, 44 miles,</i>

16:19.112 --> 16:21.746
<i> -43 miles...</i>
-Oh no, my sister's
in danger.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.155
Tess... No, no, no, Tess!

16:31.157 --> 16:33.257
Listen. The quiz is over.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.059
I'm here because I want to be.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.263
I'm listening.

16:39.265 --> 16:43.368
So I was really caught up
with trying to win
that sewing machine

16:43.370 --> 16:46.037
and I used you...
that was wrong.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.174
And since my sewing machine
was broken, I, uh,

16:50.176 --> 16:51.476
I made you this by hand.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.211
No way. No way!

16:53.213 --> 16:56.047
A custom-made
Froth shirt? But...

16:56.049 --> 16:57.849
What about Raven Time?

16:57.851 --> 16:59.684
You're much more
important, Tess.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.120
And chillin' with you today
really helped me

17:02.122 --> 17:04.288
get my mind off of
how much I miss my kids.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.589
Let's go watch our show.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.925
We... have a show?

17:13.165 --> 17:15.532
And you have this.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.068
(panting)
Is that what I think it is?

17:17.069 --> 17:18.736
Is that the Sew-What 8000?

17:18.738 --> 17:21.506
Whoo! Raven's Time just got
a super upgrade.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.074
-Yeah, boy!
-(both giggling)

17:23.076 --> 17:25.209
Yeah, well, my uncle knows
a guy, who knows a guy,
who knows a guy,

17:25.211 --> 17:26.978
who knows a guy
who gets a family discount.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.413
-I'm fam! I'm fam!
-You're fam! We're fam!

17:28.415 --> 17:30.481
-Let's go cloth the Froth.
-Okay.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.084
(thunder cracking)

17:38.892 --> 17:40.658
Okay, Nia.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.727
You'll be safe here
in the van.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.929
-Stay there.
-I will. I will, Dad.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.264
Nia, before I go...

17:46.266 --> 17:48.766
I know, I know.
You love me. Thanks.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.835
That, and check my wave.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.503
Oh. You're good.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.939
-You're good.
-Truck. You. In it.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.441
I got. Okay, okay.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.776
(shrieks)

18:00.213 --> 18:02.313
(panicked shouting)

18:04.918 --> 18:06.884
Maybe Booker was right.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.920
Maybe I'm not cut out
for this.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.792
-Mom, we need to talk.
-Yeah?

18:14.794 --> 18:16.194
About our feels.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.297
I'm sorry I blew up earlier.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.966
Oh, sweetie. Honey.

18:21.968 --> 18:25.303
I'm sorry I made you do
all those silly activities,
you know?

18:25.305 --> 18:29.740
I just felt so guilty
for being away for so long,
you know?

18:29.742 --> 18:31.909
I was afraid you were
growing up too fast.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.212
Mom, it's not your fault.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.080
-I've always been like this...
-Well, yeah.

18:36.082 --> 18:38.082
...long before you left.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.784
I like being precocious.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.985
(chuckles)

18:42.455 --> 18:44.222
Per-what-cious?

18:44.224 --> 18:47.291
We really have to bring back
our word of the day calendar.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.693
Yeah.

18:48.695 --> 18:52.330
How about this?
How about whenever
anything's bothering us,

18:52.332 --> 18:55.933
we just, you know,
sit around and talk
about our feels, huh?

18:55.935 --> 18:57.268
I love feels.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.804
Yeah, I know you love feels.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.190
I know what else you love.

19:02.191 --> 19:04.575
How about we go play
bingo with Gertrude in 2B?
Huh? What do you say?

19:04.577 --> 19:05.810
-Actually...
-Yeah?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.278
Do you still have
that boomerang?

19:07.280 --> 19:10.114
Oh! Do I still have
that boomerang?

19:10.116 --> 19:12.683
Do I still have
that boomerang?

19:12.685 --> 19:15.553
No, honey. I threw it
and it didn't come back.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.257
¶ ¶

19:20.827 --> 19:23.127
(whimpers)
Okay.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.429
Okay, this time I'm gonna
go out and...

19:25.431 --> 19:27.198
I'm gonna help.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.836
(whimpers)
Okay, maybe five more minutes.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.109
Booker, what are you
doing here?

19:38.111 --> 19:39.277
I had a vision.

19:39.279 --> 19:42.346
-What?
-Uh, your power went out
and I got bored.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.049
-Dad, where's Nia?
-She's in the van.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.018
-You should go there too.
-Okay.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.623
(grunting)

19:53.393 --> 19:55.993
We're here in downtown Dallas!

19:55.995 --> 19:58.095
-(bicycle bell chimes)
-Bike!

20:01.134 --> 20:03.234
As you can see, folks,

20:03.236 --> 20:06.137
this storm is worse than anyone
could have predicted.

20:06.139 --> 20:09.240
This is D. Carter
in D-Town,

20:09.242 --> 20:11.209
urging you to stay safe, Texas.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.196
Nia, you're safe!

20:15.197 --> 20:17.080
-Yeah.
-I had a vision of you
getting pummeled by this storm.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.750
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I've literally been in here
the whole time.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.986
Okay, good.
Listen, Nia.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.555
I didn't mean to push you
into a dangerous situation.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.158
I mean, you are so not
cut out for all this.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.461
Ooh! Okay.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.198
(grunts)

20:34.200 --> 20:36.100
Ooh, it's nice
and cozy in here.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.535
They need help!

20:37.537 --> 20:40.404
(indistinct shouting)

20:40.406 --> 20:42.073
I'm going in.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.375
-Who to the what now?
-Yeah.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.510
Yeah, you're right.
It's time for me to act.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.346
No, Nia! My vision!

20:49.582 --> 20:51.182
Hey, hey, hey!

20:56.189 --> 20:57.521
Stay safe.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.295
Oh! Let me help you, okay?

21:05.298 --> 21:06.197
Nia!

21:07.533 --> 21:09.200
I told you to stay
in the truck.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.103
Here you go.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.006
Okay.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.343
Hey! I got you, okay?

21:20.546 --> 21:22.813
You're good.
You're good, okay?

21:24.217 --> 21:26.284
(whimpering)

21:31.157 --> 21:32.490
Wow.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.293
That was my vision.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.728
Nia slays!

21:37.730 --> 21:39.163
You're like a super Nia.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.132
Hey, Nia. Nia!

21:41.134 --> 21:44.602
Nia! Nia! Nia! Nia! Nia! Nia!

21:44.604 --> 21:46.737
Nia, this twister
thinks I'm a snack!

21:46.739 --> 21:48.072
I got you!

21:48.074 --> 21:49.473
I have you! You're good.
I got you!

21:49.475 --> 21:52.143
-Aah!
-Hang on! I got you!

21:52.145 --> 21:54.312
-(Booker screaming)
-You're good!

21:54.314 --> 21:57.448
Newsman:
<i> Breaking news. We go to live</i>
<i> footage in Dallas, Texas,</i>

21:57.450 --> 21:59.350
<i> where a boy caught</i>
<i> in a mini twister</i>

21:59.352 --> 22:01.485
<i> is being rescued by</i>
<i> an unlikely hero.</i>

22:01.487 --> 22:02.687
What the what?

22:02.689 --> 22:04.288
Newsman:
<i> Let's go to the footage now.</i>

22:04.290 --> 22:06.857
-I got you! You're good.
Don't let go!
-(Booker screaming)

22:06.859 --> 22:09.293
(sputters)
Is that my baby?!

22:09.295 --> 22:11.929
Look at Nia, Ms. B.
She looks awesome.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.931
That's my best friend,
that's my best friend.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.500
Yeah, is she saving that child?

22:16.502 --> 22:17.935
(Booker screaming)

22:17.937 --> 22:20.304
Is that child Booker?

22:20.306 --> 22:24.442
Oh! Devon is gonna get it.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.211
¶ ¶

22:27.213 --> 22:29.046
Booker! Nia!

22:29.048 --> 22:31.816
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, Dad. We're fine.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.217
Thanks to Nia.

22:33.219 --> 22:35.853
You know, Nia,
I was wrong about you.

22:35.855 --> 22:38.022
You're more than
a post-avist.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.323
You act.

22:39.325 --> 22:41.025
I was wrong
about you too, Booker.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.127
I mean, you do care
about something.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.747
Me.

22:45.748 --> 22:47.932
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, I mean,
care is a strong word.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.136
"Afraid of mom if I came home
without you" is more like it.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.705
Yeah, I know that fear.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.374
I gotta finish my broadcast.

22:58.311 --> 23:01.078
Hey, Booker, look.
We're twins.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.847
You know, and we need
to start acting like it.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.249
From now on, we have to have
each other's backs.

23:05.251 --> 23:07.918
Yeah, me and you
against the world.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.820
Like it used to be
when we were kids.

23:11.324 --> 23:12.790
-Ah!
-(giggles)

23:12.792 --> 23:15.726
Well, it seems the storm
has passed,

23:15.728 --> 23:17.528
and everyone is safe.

23:17.530 --> 23:20.064
I'd like to thank all
the volunteers.

23:20.066 --> 23:24.769
Including my personal she-ro,
Nia Baxter-Carter.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.604
And my favorite son Booker.

23:27.707 --> 23:30.674
This is Devon Carter,
for KYBT weather,

23:30.676 --> 23:33.244
signing off as one lucky father.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.413
(cell phone ringing)

23:36.716 --> 23:38.783
-Who's that?
-Oh, it's your mom.

23:38.785 --> 23:42.086
Nia/Booker:
You gon' get it.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.088
¶ ¶

23:44.090 --> 23:45.890
-(chuckling)
-Whoo!

23:45.892 --> 23:48.426
-Nia, you are awesome
at Fork-Knife.
-Thank you.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.593
Even better than Dad.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.262
Yeah, I have a feeling

23:51.264 --> 23:53.431
that he is gonna be
tied up for a while.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.299
Devon. Devo-- No!
Devon.

23:55.301 --> 23:58.436
I will call you every week
if I need to.

23:58.438 --> 24:01.105
Yes, every week.
Why? Because I told you

24:01.107 --> 24:03.441
to call me if something
happened to these babies.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.876
And here I see Booker
on the news

24:05.878 --> 24:08.979
flailing like one of them
balloons at the car dealership.

24:08.981 --> 24:11.115
Nia? Oh, Nia was beautiful.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.317
Yeah, she was great.
She was-- That wasn't
the point, Devon!

24:16.255 --> 24:18.556
Wow. You're still going
at it, huh?

24:18.558 --> 24:20.291
Yeah, just like old times.

24:20.293 --> 24:24.628
No, no. I'ma call you again
and again and again

24:24.630 --> 24:26.297
and-- No. I'm gonna
call you again.

24:26.299 --> 24:27.898
-I'm gonna call you right now.
-(buttons beeping)

24:27.900 --> 24:29.633
See? I'm gonna call you.
