WEBVTT

01:34.093 --> 01:35.469
Morning.

01:35.469 --> 01:37.430
This would do wonders for tourism.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.975
Yes. Who called it in?

01:40.975 --> 01:43.769
Jogger from the Lowles found
the victims at 6:15.

01:43.769 --> 01:45.938
Victims?
I'm only seeing one victim.

01:45.938 --> 01:47.773
No, there was a girl down there.

01:47.773 --> 01:51.068
A Jane Renshaw. Age 24.
Here from Iowa.

01:51.068 --> 01:55.448
She was beat the hell, unconscious and
half drowned. She's over at St. Luke's.

01:58.242 --> 02:00.411
Well they made sure he was dead.

02:01.746 --> 02:02.496
Did you get an I.D.?

02:02.496 --> 02:05.625
No, and she was too
out of it to help.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.419
He was running away.

02:09.711 --> 02:12.381
Why kill a guy who's running
from the scene?

02:13.424 --> 02:17.178
Yes, there in lies the rub my friend.

02:17.178 --> 02:22.600
The evidence, as always,
will speak for itself.

03:18.012 --> 03:20.098
Why did you die so far
from the girl, huh?

03:21.140 --> 03:22.517
What's he telling you Alexx?

03:22.517 --> 03:25.645
Sustained blunt force
trauma to the head.

03:27.772 --> 03:33.111
Multiple blows based on the blood.
Liver temperature is 87.2.

03:33.111 --> 03:35.113
So he died around midnight.

03:35.321 --> 03:39.492
Juggular. Not a knife though.
Irregular object.

03:40.577 --> 03:41.619
Bled out.

03:44.998 --> 03:47.250
What's this mark on his
cheek right there?

03:49.335 --> 03:53.256
Burn mark. Little bit of ash.
Something brown.

03:53.464 --> 03:55.550
Smashing and slashing
aren't enough.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.554
Gotta burn him too huh.

04:00.638 --> 04:04.809
If I'm gonna mess somebody up like
this, I don't do it out in the open.

04:06.853 --> 04:08.938
Unless you're not worried about it.

04:16.696 --> 04:19.324
Male victim's hair is black.

04:20.366 --> 04:24.203
Got blond here.
Just like the female vic.

04:24.203 --> 04:28.708
So our guy and girl grab a blanket;
have a little fun in the moonlight.

04:29.584 --> 04:31.628
Until they are rudely interrupted.

04:34.756 --> 04:37.884
She's assaulted.
Tossed into the ocean left to die.

04:40.428 --> 04:41.971
Guy tries to escape.

04:44.682 --> 04:48.436
Half dead, scared out of his
mind, he runs.

04:48.436 --> 04:51.773
And someone catches up
to him over here.

04:51.773 --> 04:54.901
So that makes these the last
footsteps of his life.

04:54.984 --> 04:56.236
Megan Donner.

04:58.529 --> 04:59.781
I'll be right there.

05:00.615 --> 05:03.076
Sart nurse. They've completed their exam.
We can talk to her now.

05:03.076 --> 05:04.494
Keep me posted.

05:04.702 --> 05:05.745
Got it.

05:14.671 --> 05:16.756
Who wants to help me
search around the girl?

05:17.799 --> 05:21.135
We're working on the murder scene.
You ask for the girl?

05:21.135 --> 05:23.012
I like a challenge.

05:23.721 --> 05:25.390
Tide can come in at any moment.

05:27.767 --> 05:28.851
Too much.

05:28.851 --> 05:29.769
Hey check this out.

05:29.769 --> 05:30.603
What have you got?

05:30.603 --> 05:32.647
It's still sharp. No erosion.

05:32.647 --> 05:35.358
Damn good chance that could
be from last night.

05:38.695 --> 05:40.488
This is everything she had on.

05:40.572 --> 05:42.115
Any indication of rape?

05:42.115 --> 05:43.741
We recovered what
looks like semen.

05:43.741 --> 05:45.743
Tears on the lower part of her vagina.

05:45.743 --> 05:49.080
Six, seven and eight o'clock.
Also a grade three concussion.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.123
She give you a name?

05:50.123 --> 05:54.294
She suffered a pretty severe trauma.
She doesn't remember the last twelve hours.

05:56.796 --> 06:01.259
Oh listen. She got antsy when I tried
to administer an oral swab.

06:04.429 --> 06:06.556
Sense memory.
She's repressing.

06:06.556 --> 06:07.890
She's right there on the edge.

06:09.559 --> 06:10.602
I'll see what I can do.

06:10.602 --> 06:11.644
Thanks Megan.

06:18.943 --> 06:19.986
Hi Jane.

06:21.112 --> 06:24.449
My name is Megan Donner.
I'm a crime scene investigator.

06:31.998 --> 06:33.541
They said I was attacked.

06:35.627 --> 06:36.836
We don't know by whom.

06:37.879 --> 06:41.007
They won't tell me if my
boyfriend Paul's okay.

06:42.884 --> 06:44.135
Paul Vernet?

06:45.511 --> 06:48.640
We don't know yet.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.559
Right now, I'd like to
concentrate on you.

06:55.021 --> 06:57.523
We have evidence of
a sexual assault.

06:59.359 --> 07:02.612
If we're gonna find the
person who did this to you...

07:03.905 --> 07:05.073
I need your help.

07:07.158 --> 07:10.286
The more evidence we collect from you,
the better our chance of catching him.

07:14.249 --> 07:16.334
Would you let me complete
the exam?

07:27.971 --> 07:29.013
Thanks.

07:45.697 --> 07:46.739
Can you open?

07:48.616 --> 07:50.702
That's good.
That's good.

07:54.581 --> 07:56.040
Do you wear a retainer?

07:59.210 --> 08:01.296
Would it be ok if I removed it?

08:17.895 --> 08:21.649
I'm gonna, um, take
this for now, ok?

08:27.071 --> 08:29.699
Detective Fenwick will be
here in a few minutes.

08:30.909 --> 08:34.871
He needs to ask you some
questions about Paul.

08:39.458 --> 08:40.710
I'll be right outside.

08:49.802 --> 08:50.803
What are you up to?

08:51.512 --> 08:54.140
Sands from the hot area
around the male victim.

08:54.140 --> 08:56.267
Didn't you already sift
around that area?

08:56.267 --> 09:00.438
Yeah. But there was a struggle,
paramedics came through,

09:00.939 --> 09:03.441
sometimes things get buried.
So I dug a little deeper.

09:03.900 --> 09:06.402
Oh my gosh.
Aren't you ambitious.

09:08.488 --> 09:09.489
Yeah, look at this.

09:10.531 --> 09:12.951
Nose piece from eyeglasses.

09:13.284 --> 09:14.327
That's right.

09:20.541 --> 09:24.003
Proof of blood.
Pink always was my favorite color.

09:24.420 --> 09:25.755
I'll get this over to DNA.

09:25.755 --> 09:27.298
I'll take it. I'm going
that way anyways.

09:27.298 --> 09:30.009
You sure?
Great!

09:40.061 --> 09:42.146
Something in the neck wound.

09:45.858 --> 09:47.443
Looks like glass.

09:47.443 --> 09:49.946
We found a lot of broken
glass at the scene.

09:53.408 --> 09:57.870
Approximately five meters from the body.
Is your glass green in color?

09:57.870 --> 09:59.414
Copy that.

09:59.414 --> 10:03.334
So that means somebody jabbed our
guy with a broken bottle, doesn't it.

10:03.334 --> 10:07.338
Interesting. Because I'm thinking
he was a bartender.

10:07.630 --> 10:08.840
Based on?

10:08.840 --> 10:11.009
Lime peel on his fingernails.

10:12.051 --> 10:15.888
And these rashes.
Occupational dermatosis.

10:15.888 --> 10:20.059
You can get it from squeezing a lot of
lemons or limes in direct sunlight.

10:20.059 --> 10:25.023
Female victim stated that her
boyfriend was a CPA.

10:25.023 --> 10:26.858
Maybe he moonlights.

10:28.526 --> 10:31.362
Also said the boyfriend had
light brown hair.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.698
This guy's is black.

10:33.907 --> 10:35.366
Check his eye color please.

10:39.704 --> 10:40.580
Green.

10:40.580 --> 10:43.875
CPA has brown.
You know what that means.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.210
This ain't her boyfriend.

10:46.210 --> 10:50.381
This ain't her boyfriend but it might
be why he's on your table Alexx.

10:50.381 --> 10:51.466
Thank you.

10:52.300 --> 10:53.676
Detective Fenwick.

10:53.676 --> 10:54.636
This is Horatio Caine.

10:54.636 --> 10:58.473
Meet me at the female victim's hotel.
The Agramont.

10:58.473 --> 11:01.809
That's right the Agramont. I'm on
my way. Thank you Alexx.

11:10.318 --> 11:11.236
Who are you guys?

11:11.236 --> 11:12.487
Paul Varnette?

11:13.529 --> 11:14.864
What's going on?

11:16.950 --> 11:19.327
Well Paul, your girlfriend, Jane,
is in the hospital.

11:19.535 --> 11:22.789
The guy she was with
last night is dead...

11:22.789 --> 11:26.125
and you look like you've been up all
night, so why don't you tell me.

12:10.675 --> 12:12.677
Got here as fast as I could.

12:12.677 --> 12:14.471
Traffic on the causeway.

12:15.513 --> 12:17.474
I can't believe someone
did this to Jane.

12:17.682 --> 12:19.100
When's the last time
you saw her?

12:21.186 --> 12:24.648
Maybe eleven.
We were at a party and...

12:25.690 --> 12:30.487
I passed out. I woke up at the
guest house an hour ago.

12:30.695 --> 12:32.656
Cubanos.
These are illegal you know.

12:33.698 --> 12:36.243
I got them from a guy at the airport.

12:36.243 --> 12:38.203
I'm going to take them into
evidence, if you don't mind.

12:38.203 --> 12:39.162
I don't understand.

12:39.162 --> 12:40.789
It's not important that you do.

12:40.789 --> 12:42.749
How did you get those
cuts on your hands.

12:43.792 --> 12:49.005
I don't no. I was drunk.
Hamilton's throw a good party.

12:50.423 --> 12:54.302
THE Hamiltons? Governors, Senators,
war heroes Hamiltons?

12:54.302 --> 12:57.806
I went to business school with
Tyler Hamilton at Vanderbilt.

12:57.806 --> 13:01.226
You know, he said, if we were in Miami,
we had an open invitation.

13:01.226 --> 13:03.520
Pretty girl like Jane,
I don't doubt it.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.688
You know the family?

13:06.147 --> 13:07.190
I do.

13:09.609 --> 13:12.320
Have you, um, ever seen him before?

13:12.904 --> 13:16.241
No. Look I haven't DONE anything?

13:16.283 --> 13:18.868
I never saw this guy and
I never hurt Jane.

13:18.868 --> 13:22.330
Paul, did you teach Jane a lesso
for stepping out on you?

13:22.330 --> 13:24.040
NO! No way.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.168
Then, you won't mind giving us a
DNA sample. To rule you out.

13:29.421 --> 13:30.463
No problem.

13:31.423 --> 13:34.968
But listen, I uh, Jane and I
did have sex recently.

13:36.052 --> 13:37.345
How recently?

13:37.554 --> 13:39.264
Yesterday.
Before the party.

13:39.264 --> 13:40.307
Open up.

13:43.351 --> 13:43.977
Thank you.

13:43.977 --> 13:47.105
We were playing around and...things got...

13:47.981 --> 13:49.149
kinda rough.

13:50.567 --> 13:51.902
If you find anything...

13:51.902 --> 13:53.987
You'll be the first to know.

13:56.197 --> 13:58.825
Oh, this guy is a friend of the Hamiltons.

14:01.328 --> 14:03.413
Let's not let him out of our sight, ok?

14:17.093 --> 14:18.470
Horatio Caine.

14:18.470 --> 14:19.512
Come in.

14:19.512 --> 14:20.555
Thank you.

14:30.273 --> 14:31.399
Nice suit.

14:32.233 --> 14:34.569
I'm pulling out my fall stuff.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.279
I heard you got something
from the beach.

14:36.279 --> 14:39.824
A nosepiece with blood evidence.
Lab has it now.

14:39.824 --> 14:43.745
I'm surprised the Hamiltons are still here.
Usually they're in Vermont this time of year.

14:43.745 --> 14:46.039
All this peak foliage.

14:46.039 --> 14:50.126
Calleigh, you seem to know as much about
this family as you do about 9 millimeters.

14:50.460 --> 14:53.380
They're American royalty.
What can I say?

14:53.380 --> 14:56.216
Eric stay off the property
but take a look around.

14:56.508 --> 14:57.592
You got it H.

15:00.428 --> 15:01.513
Here we go.

15:05.600 --> 15:09.521
Horatio. Good to get your call.
I don't think you've been here since, huh...

15:09.521 --> 15:10.730
A while.

15:11.481 --> 15:13.566
Calleigh Duquesne,
Detective Fenwick.

15:14.109 --> 15:19.030
Nice to meet you all. Please come in.
I'm sorry about the circumstances.

15:19.030 --> 15:22.492
Any leads on that beach attack?
It's all over the news.

15:22.993 --> 15:25.996
Actually we think the victims...
we at your party last night.

15:26.830 --> 15:27.831
You're kidding.

15:27.831 --> 15:29.541
No, I'm not.

15:29.874 --> 15:33.628
Well, I wasn't my party.
It was my nephew, Tyler's.

15:33.628 --> 15:34.754
It was past my bedtime.

15:34.754 --> 15:36.089
We'd like to talk to him.

15:36.089 --> 15:38.341
Certainly. Right this way.

15:40.427 --> 15:43.013
Yeah, Paul's a buddy
of mine from school.

15:43.597 --> 15:45.098
His girlfriend is the woman
who got raped?

15:45.098 --> 15:46.308
That's right.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.603
Geez. So who's the guy
who got killed?

15:51.479 --> 15:53.773
We think he may have tended
bar at your party last night.

15:53.773 --> 15:57.903
I, I don't recognize him. But if she's
ok, can't she tell you who he is?

15:57.903 --> 15:59.070
Well, we're looking at that.

15:59.070 --> 16:01.323
Paul says he never went down
to the beach last night.

16:01.323 --> 16:02.449
That he slept in your
guest house.

16:02.449 --> 16:04.618
Yeah, he was pretty messed up.
I let him crash.

16:04.618 --> 16:06.870
Mind if I take a look at the guest
house to confirm his story?

16:06.870 --> 16:09.247
I'm afraid I wouldn't be comfortable
with that Horatio.

16:10.290 --> 16:13.251
We are merely trying to find evidence
that could exonerate your friend.

16:13.251 --> 16:16.421
And we're cooperating. Tyler will tell
you everything that he knows.

16:16.421 --> 16:19.257
But if you want to conduct a search,
legally you need a warrant.

16:19.257 --> 16:20.926
That's true.
Horatio.

16:21.426 --> 16:22.677
Interesting bottle.

16:23.595 --> 16:26.765
Green glass is similar to the glass
we found on the male victim.

16:26.765 --> 16:29.684
Every house on this beach serves
that kind of champagne.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.978
Every wine and liquor store
in the area sells it.

16:32.354 --> 16:36.024
Look if I let you take it then the
tabloids will be calling this a raid.

16:36.024 --> 16:37.901
And I won't put my family
through that.

16:37.943 --> 16:41.947
Mr. Hamilton, a terrible thing has happened
just outside your property line.

16:41.947 --> 16:44.199
Well, just like that attack
on Hobe beach.

16:44.741 --> 16:47.994
Horatio, you know what Miami
has turned into.

16:47.994 --> 16:51.331
Look at the gangs before you point
at my family or our friends.

16:52.249 --> 16:53.833
I'll keep that in mind.

16:56.962 --> 16:59.798
State's attorney says we might be able
to get a warrant to search this place.

16:59.798 --> 17:01.007
At least the guest house.

17:01.007 --> 17:03.134
We have one chance to get a
warrant against these people.

17:03.134 --> 17:06.262
The first judge who turns us down
we're dead, so let's motor on that.

17:06.262 --> 17:07.305
What have you got?

17:07.638 --> 17:10.224
Got the name of a bartender
who left early last night.

17:10.224 --> 17:12.894
Still hasn't shown up to collect his
share of the tips.

17:12.894 --> 17:16.481
It's, ah, Estebban Ordonez. Guatamalan.
Temporary visa, no relatives.

17:16.481 --> 17:17.941
Black hair, green eyes?

17:18.692 --> 17:19.733
I'll tell you later.

18:01.943 --> 18:05.238
Guess who's prints were on that busted bottle.
The one that we found on the beach.

18:05.238 --> 18:07.532
Paul Varnette.
The boyfriend.

18:08.116 --> 18:10.368
Paul touched the champagne bottle
that end up on the beach.

18:10.368 --> 18:13.705
Champagne bottle is the murder weapon.
I tested it.

18:17.334 --> 18:22.339
Identical float density to the glass
found in the dead guy's neck.

18:23.256 --> 18:26.092
So Paul catches his girl with Estebban.

18:26.092 --> 18:28.929
Tossed the guy.
Assaults the girl.

18:28.929 --> 18:30.555
It's gonna be hard to prove rape.

18:30.555 --> 18:33.391
Paul admitted he and Jane
had consensual sex yesterday.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.518
What's the microscope say.

18:35.727 --> 18:39.814
Ten spermatazoa per view.
Fifty percent still have their tails.

18:39.814 --> 18:43.360
Timeline fits his story but that still
doesn't explain the oral cop.

18:43.902 --> 18:48.156
Retainer from Jane's mouth. Found
skin on the inside of the scope.

18:51.201 --> 18:54.204
Take a look at this.
Can't be her tongue?

18:54.913 --> 18:56.039
Thin epidermis.

18:56.039 --> 19:01.461
Lots of blood vessels and the sebacious
glands are separate from the hair follicles

19:02.087 --> 19:04.172
We're talking penis tore off.

19:06.925 --> 19:08.677
You might want to get a
good hold of yourself.

19:09.219 --> 19:10.095
Why?

19:10.095 --> 19:13.014
Still have to chop it up.
Confirm it's Paul's.

19:55.098 --> 20:00.312
I compared the burn residue from the male
victim's face to the tobacco in Paul's cigar.

20:00.937 --> 20:05.108
High concentrations of lantinum
and uranium in both samples.

20:06.943 --> 20:08.361
Same brand, same soil?

20:08.361 --> 20:09.529
That's right.

20:09.529 --> 20:14.743
So Paul kills Estebban, puts the cigar out on
his face as a personal touch for stealing his girl.

20:17.662 --> 20:21.791
Staggers back to the guest house
and sleeps the whole thing off.

20:21.791 --> 20:25.629
One problem. I just ran the penile
tissue from Jane's retainer.

20:26.379 --> 20:28.882
Compared it to Paul's DNA.

20:29.466 --> 20:30.717
It's not a match.

20:31.384 --> 20:33.970
But his prints were on the
murder weapon.

20:33.970 --> 20:37.265
Maybe he didn't do this alone.
Maybe he did the killing..

20:37.265 --> 20:40.393
While somebody else sexually
assaulted his girlfriend.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.591
We know you didn't do this alone.

20:47.799 --> 20:49.259
I didn't DO anything.

20:49.259 --> 20:54.473
Paul, in all of your photographs you're
wearing a watch purchased at the airport.

20:54.931 --> 20:59.436
We found the receipt in your room.
49 bucks and water resistent down to 150 ft.

20:59.436 --> 21:01.438
And now you are sporting
that hunk of Switzerland.

21:01.438 --> 21:04.107
Huh, 13 thou worth of gold.

21:04.107 --> 21:08.904
Paul, I don't think you can afford a
watch that expensive. Do you?

21:12.949 --> 21:15.452
Good morning everyone.
Brian Coupler.

21:15.452 --> 21:20.165
I'm on retainer for the Hamiltons. They asked
me to represent you as a friend of the family.

21:20.165 --> 21:24.044
Paul, if you buy into this, the Hamiltons
will hang you out to dry in two seconds.

21:24.044 --> 21:25.587
Like you aren't?
Paul you don't..

21:25.587 --> 21:27.506
If you're innocent,
explain it to us.

21:27.506 --> 21:28.423
Stop goading him.

21:28.423 --> 21:31.551
Paul, this man is not your attorney.
You did not hire him.

21:31.551 --> 21:33.845
This is about you,
this is your life.

21:45.857 --> 21:47.150
It was kind of a gift.

21:48.193 --> 21:49.319
From?

21:53.281 --> 21:54.574
Just one kiss.

21:55.492 --> 21:57.577
Just one kiss.
That's all he kept saying.

21:57.577 --> 21:58.704
Who?

21:59.413 --> 22:00.914
Tyler Hamilton.

22:01.331 --> 22:04.334
Com'on. Just one kiss.
Trade you my watch.

22:04.334 --> 22:08.714
Com'on.  Just one kiss.
Trade you my watch.

22:14.386 --> 22:15.887
She was upset.

22:16.096 --> 22:19.641
Com'on. It's no big thing.
It's friends.

22:31.361 --> 22:35.115
I told her I was sorry. I grabbed a bottle
of champagne. I said let's go.

22:40.704 --> 22:45.917
She grabbed the bottle. She walked off.
I lost track of her. I figured she went down to the beach.

22:47.127 --> 22:49.421
I stayed and I got drunk.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.965
But you didn't follow her
out to the beach.

22:51.965 --> 22:53.008
No.

22:54.176 --> 22:55.510
But I should've.

22:58.096 --> 22:59.765
Look I screwed up.

23:00.682 --> 23:01.725
Yes you did.

23:01.892 --> 23:04.353
Yes you did.
Had you not traded her,

23:04.353 --> 23:06.438
none of this would've happened.
But that's the past.

23:07.481 --> 23:08.523
Paul let's go.

23:11.735 --> 23:13.528
I need to take a look at your watch.

23:14.404 --> 23:17.741
If you want me to buy your story,
I need to look at your watch.

24:03.245 --> 24:04.287
What have you got?

24:04.413 --> 24:08.166
Paul was telling the truth.
Found three sets of male DNA on this watch.

24:10.377 --> 24:13.630
Ok. Separate out Paul...

24:13.630 --> 24:16.842
and then cross-reference the unknowns with
the sample from the retainer. Let's do that.

24:17.050 --> 24:18.176
You got it.

24:37.946 --> 24:38.989
Drake.
Horatio.

24:39.072 --> 24:40.699
I'm here for DNA sample.

24:40.699 --> 24:42.284
Have you got a warrant?

24:42.284 --> 24:44.995
This is your opportunity to clear your name.
I suggest you take it.

24:44.995 --> 24:46.747
We have been through this Horatio.

24:46.747 --> 24:51.960
Yes we have. Back when I was a green CSI and
driver's side airbags weren't standard issue.

24:52.461 --> 24:56.131
Lucky for you though, huh. Not so lucky for
the young girl you had in your car.

24:57.215 --> 24:59.217
I have never forgotten your help.

24:59.217 --> 25:00.886
You know what I haven't forgotten?

25:00.886 --> 25:03.680
That chemical burn on your
arm on that airbag.

25:03.680 --> 25:06.308
And your watch imprint.
I haven't forgotten those things either.

25:07.517 --> 25:09.186
Well, you have some memory.

25:16.360 --> 25:17.486
Seen this before?

25:18.320 --> 25:21.073
Yeah, it's the watch I gave my
nephew a few months ago.

25:21.865 --> 25:22.908
Where did you find it?

25:23.158 --> 25:25.827
There are skin cells embedded
in the band.

25:25.827 --> 25:26.620
Skin cells.

25:26.620 --> 25:31.041
Did you know that our entire genetic
code is stored in a single cell.

25:31.041 --> 25:34.419
Now in this case, I have the
DNA of two males.

25:34.419 --> 25:37.714
One of which forced Jane Renshaw
to have oral sex.

25:37.714 --> 25:42.928
And the other one is a close relative.
Now. Which one are you?

25:52.896 --> 25:56.024
I was with her on the beach.
In a sexual way, you know?

25:56.024 --> 25:58.110
Why didn't you mention
this before?

25:58.110 --> 25:59.152
Paul's my friend.

26:00.988 --> 26:04.574
Besides, once I hit that mouse trap in
her jaw, I was pretty much over.

26:04.574 --> 26:05.993
That must have been
disappointing huh.

26:05.993 --> 26:07.035
Killed the mood.

26:08.370 --> 26:09.454
I'll tell you that much.

26:10.789 --> 26:13.750
I left her alone out there; I went
back to the guest house. I went to bed.

26:13.750 --> 26:16.128
You didn't see Estebban the
bartender out there.

26:16.128 --> 26:17.212
No.

26:17.295 --> 26:18.839
Do you have your clothes
from that night?

26:18.839 --> 26:19.673
In the guest house.

26:19.673 --> 26:20.924
I'm gonna need them.

26:20.924 --> 26:23.135
Sure if my uncle says it's okay.

26:23.427 --> 26:27.431
He's already admitted to a
consensual act, Horatio. Let it go.

26:27.431 --> 26:29.224
A man was murdered out here.

26:29.224 --> 26:34.146
Yes, but the girl is the one who will pay.
The press will eat her alive. To protect her...

26:34.146 --> 26:38.317
Are you suggesting that I protect a woman?
That's rich.

26:42.237 --> 26:43.864
More Hamilton hardball?

26:45.949 --> 26:50.120
I'm officially over them. Can you forgive
me for ever thinking that they were ever all that?

26:50.120 --> 26:52.748
Well, I made the same
mistake myself once.

26:53.123 --> 26:54.166
What do we have?

26:54.833 --> 26:56.460
Filed with the city.

26:56.460 --> 27:01.673
Public access.  So is the beach.
And the property line ends here.

27:01.923 --> 27:03.175
What's this right here?

27:03.800 --> 27:04.718
Boardwalk dock.

27:04.718 --> 27:07.846
That's also a public access.
We'll take that.

27:21.443 --> 27:22.486
Wait a minute.

27:24.655 --> 27:26.239
I've got blood drops right here.

27:27.491 --> 27:28.575
More over there.

27:30.452 --> 27:32.162
Pattern exclaimation points.

27:32.704 --> 27:34.539
Spots point the direction of the path.

27:34.539 --> 27:35.916
Yes they do.

27:36.667 --> 27:41.964
And this being a public access.
Ours for the taking.

27:47.344 --> 27:49.930
Blood you found belongs
to Estebban Ordonez.

27:50.555 --> 27:52.808
Of course we can't tell if it was from him
or someone with his blood on 'im.

27:52.808 --> 27:56.979
Ok but it doesn't matter because the murdered
man's blood leads up to the Hamilton's house.

27:57.479 --> 27:58.522
We got the warrant.

28:02.317 --> 28:04.820
HEY!
HEY!

28:36.375 --> 28:38.043
We're not even sure what
we're looking for.

28:38.460 --> 28:43.173
We never are. But be happy for
Tyler's clothes from that night.

28:43.173 --> 28:46.301
Shirt, shoes, anything.

28:48.178 --> 28:53.600
Unless of course he
already burned them.

28:54.268 --> 28:57.396
You know what that means.
Dig in.

29:00.065 --> 29:01.608
That's one way to bury your past.

29:01.608 --> 29:04.278
We've had plans to put in a tennis court
for months. Check our contract.

29:04.278 --> 29:05.571
Oh we are. Believe me.

29:05.571 --> 29:06.739
Horatio, if I had known.

29:06.739 --> 29:10.409
You knew. I want a DNA
sample from both of them.

29:10.409 --> 29:12.703
Just because we can.
Okay?

29:17.499 --> 29:18.542
Open wide.

29:19.835 --> 29:21.920
Relax. I won't jam it in too hard.

30:05.714 --> 30:07.758
I'm gonna head back to the lab guys.

30:09.218 --> 30:10.260
See you there.

30:15.641 --> 30:17.726
Hey guys.

30:22.106 --> 30:27.027
Hamilton men, try as they might,
cannot hide their zippers.

30:27.403 --> 30:28.821
Very carefully please.

30:31.824 --> 30:35.661
Zipper's from a guy's medium
size warm up jacket.

30:35.661 --> 30:37.746
Manufactured by Fubu.

30:37.746 --> 30:40.207
It's the same kind that Tyler
was wearing at the, uh,

30:40.207 --> 30:43.335
night of the party according
to the pictures from homicide.

30:44.336 --> 30:45.587
You look for trace?

30:45.587 --> 30:48.716
Isolated fragments of glass
in the zipper teeth.

30:49.842 --> 30:53.387
Glass melts at 2700
degree Fahrenheight.

30:53.804 --> 30:58.183
Yes but wood fire only gets up to one thousand
and the Hamiltons' couldn't have known that.

30:58.392 --> 31:00.602
Density matches the murder weapon.

31:00.602 --> 31:02.354
Tyler clobbers the guy.

31:04.314 --> 31:07.443
And glass rains down on his jacket.

31:11.405 --> 31:14.283
It's weird how one kiss can
turn into just a mess.

31:14.616 --> 31:17.536
Cigar you asked me to process
from the guest house.

31:17.536 --> 31:20.414
Same tobacco as the burn
on Estebban's face.

31:20.414 --> 31:25.127
Saliva. Tyler's.
And the material on the end, silica.

31:25.669 --> 31:27.796
Aka beach sand.

31:27.796 --> 31:31.425
Let's go talk to the young Mr. Hamilton.
Nice going.

31:39.099 --> 31:40.142
So Tyler.

31:41.560 --> 31:45.814
You pony up the 13 thousand
dollar watch for just one kiss.

31:45.814 --> 31:48.525
And the young lady runs off with
the bartender anyway.

31:55.032 --> 31:57.659
Bet that kiss is gonna cost you a
lot more than your watch.

31:59.845 --> 32:03.056
So what. The bartender changes
into his street clothes,

32:04.349 --> 32:05.893
and the girl walked off with him?

32:11.648 --> 32:14.776
You just went out there to razz
the guy for stealing your girl.

32:19.865 --> 32:24.453
But once you saw that lowly bartender
kissing the girl that blew you off,

32:24.995 --> 32:28.332
the old Hamilton arrogance
turned into rage.

32:37.883 --> 32:41.011
And you have what you claim
to be consensual sex.

32:49.603 --> 32:53.774
And then you leave the young
woman alone to die in the water.

32:56.819 --> 32:57.903
If you say so.

32:57.903 --> 33:02.908
But that wasn't enough. You go the
extra yard and you burn the man's face.

33:09.998 --> 33:11.458
He ran.

33:11.458 --> 33:16.171
You caught up and you cut his throat
with what was left of that champagne bottle.

33:21.176 --> 33:22.511
You're way off.

33:22.803 --> 33:24.680
Then why don't you educate us.

33:27.724 --> 33:28.767
Excuse me.

33:31.311 --> 33:34.648
I know this is gonna be good.
What's  going on.

33:34.815 --> 33:36.608
Tyler Hamilton doesn't
wear glasses.

33:38.694 --> 33:39.903
Excuse me?

33:39.903 --> 33:42.698
The nose piece from the
glasses at the crime scene.

33:42.698 --> 33:45.826
DNA tripled checked it and found
blood from our dead guy on it.

33:45.993 --> 33:47.369
Transfer spatter.

33:47.369 --> 33:49.163
Direct spatter, medium force.

33:49.705 --> 33:53.834
The only way you get spatter from a nose piece
is to be there when the murder's happening.

33:53.834 --> 33:58.297
I know but Tyler Hamilton doesn't wear
glasses so it can't be Tyler's nose piece.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.841
Drake wears glasses.
Bring him in.

34:00.841 --> 34:02.926
Ok.
Thank you.

34:06.597 --> 34:07.723
Drake.

34:08.891 --> 34:10.641
Yes, Horatio.

34:10.641 --> 34:12.186
I'm gonna need your glasses.

34:12.936 --> 34:14.271
For what?

34:14.480 --> 34:19.485
Either you take them off or I'm gonna
take them off you. You decide.

34:30.954 --> 34:33.331
Good decision.
Now sit down.

35:31.473 --> 35:32.516
You did this.

35:38.147 --> 35:43.026
In your attempt to wipe away the blood, Drake,
you merely pushed it to the corner of your lens.

35:46.321 --> 35:51.535
So slit the juggular. Wet blood.
You had to be inches away.

36:09.636 --> 36:14.433
I, um, I heard a scream.

36:19.521 --> 36:22.858
And by the time I got
down to the beach...

36:35.370 --> 36:40.584
Mr. Hamilton. Hamilton!
Mr. Hamilton?

36:42.878 --> 36:45.589
Somebody help me!
No no. Don't! Wait, Wait!

36:45.589 --> 36:48.717
Somebody! HELP!
There's been a murder! HELP!

37:09.988 --> 37:11.323
I'm sorry, uncle.

37:11.740 --> 37:12.783
Shut up.

37:14.535 --> 37:16.620
Get out of those clothes.

37:24.169 --> 37:27.089
Again, you have made this
statement against my counsel.

37:27.923 --> 37:29.216
Let is go, Coupler.

37:29.216 --> 37:30.300
We're looking at life.

37:31.426 --> 37:32.469
Are you aware of that.

37:32.594 --> 37:33.637
Without parole.

37:38.433 --> 37:39.476
What a waste.

37:40.269 --> 37:41.311
What a waste.

37:44.022 --> 37:45.065
You said ...

37:47.109 --> 37:51.697
our entire genetic makeup is in one cell.

37:54.575 --> 37:57.077
How do we escape that?

38:00.080 --> 38:01.123
Your family?

38:02.958 --> 38:05.043
You stop procreating.

38:33.822 --> 38:34.865
Thank you.

38:36.909 --> 38:38.035
Taxi's downstairs.

38:38.619 --> 38:39.661
I'll walk ya.

38:46.418 --> 38:47.419
Jane.

38:47.419 --> 38:49.463
Bad idea Paul.

38:50.506 --> 38:53.634
Can I talk to you?
Please.

38:56.136 --> 38:58.222
I'll meet you in the lobby.

39:06.730 --> 39:09.650
I had no idea that Tyler
was going to hurt her.

39:09.650 --> 39:13.195
She has to know that.
I love her.

39:13.904 --> 39:18.283
If you loved her, you wouldn't
have traded her for a watch.

39:41.473 --> 39:42.391
Mind if I join you?

39:42.391 --> 39:43.642
Not at all.

39:50.065 --> 39:51.525
Hamiltons are all over the TV too.

39:53.402 --> 39:55.404
Deja vu.

39:55.404 --> 39:56.905
The old case?

39:57.948 --> 39:59.491
Fifteen years ago.

40:01.577 --> 40:03.036
I wasn't on the job then.

40:11.336 --> 40:13.839
July 25, 1987.

40:14.047 --> 40:18.594
I found Drake Hamilton's car by the side
of the road after a terrible accident.

40:19.011 --> 40:24.224
Girl in the front seat, dead.
No Drake.

40:24.308 --> 40:28.353
I went up to the Hamilton residence where
I was received like a diplomat.

40:28.353 --> 40:30.981
Glad handing promises,
blah blah blah.

40:30.981 --> 40:36.195
Drake will be right down. Well, he did
come down, four hours later.

40:36.278 --> 40:41.492
With three attorneys in tow and a story
about how Drake lent the girl the car.

40:44.620 --> 40:47.664
So with no clothes at the scene,

40:47.664 --> 40:52.127
solid alibi and a  mysterious chemical
burn on his forearm,

40:53.253 --> 40:54.296
we had nothing.

40:55.088 --> 40:58.425
No charges were ever filed.
He walked.

40:58.425 --> 41:00.344
No investigation.

41:00.344 --> 41:02.805
At ME later told me...

41:02.805 --> 41:08.018
that the girl bled out and that all he had to do
was call 911 from the road ...

41:08.811 --> 41:10.479
and she would've lived.

41:12.022 --> 41:13.607
He didn't do that.

41:15.692 --> 41:16.819
Horatio.

41:17.945 --> 41:18.987
We got him.

41:20.155 --> 41:21.406
We got him now.

41:27.996 --> 41:30.499
If I had nailed him fifteen years ago...

41:33.293 --> 41:35.379
Let's hope for the next one.

41:39.883 --> 41:40.926
Let's do that.
