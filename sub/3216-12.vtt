NARRATOR:
Previously on Supernatural:

00:02.503 --> 00:03.587
Sammy.

00:03.796 --> 00:06.132
Take your brother outside
as fast as you can! Go!

00:09.969 --> 00:13.264
Dad's on a hunting trip.
And he hasn't been home in a few days.

00:16.934 --> 00:20.229
DEAN: This was Dad's book. I think he
wants us to pick up where he left off.

00:20.479 --> 00:23.190
Saving people. Hunting things.
The family business.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.401
I gotta find Dad.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.236
It's the only thing I can think about.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.034
(VEHICLE APPROACHING)

00:46.630 --> 00:49.508
-What do you got those amped up to?
-A hundred thousand volts.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.178
-Damn.
-I want this Rawhead extra crispy.

00:52.428 --> 00:55.264
Now remember, you only get one shot
with these things.

00:55.473 --> 00:57.892
So make it count.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.704
(CLATTERING)

01:29.924 --> 01:31.342
DEAN (WHISPERING):
On three.

01:32.134 --> 01:36.180
One, two, three.

(GIRL SCREAMS)

01:40.392 --> 01:42.144
Is it still here?

01:42.394 --> 01:45.940
Grab your sister's hand. We're gonna
get you out of here. Let's go.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.737
All right, go.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.240
(GIRL SCREAMING)

01:54.490 --> 01:56.200
DEAN:
Sam!

02:02.164 --> 02:05.000
-Sam, get them out of here.
-You take this.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.378
Go!

02:16.428 --> 02:18.973
DEAN:
Come on.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.583
(GRUNTING)

02:57.595 --> 03:00.139
Dean! Dean!

03:00.389 --> 03:02.975
Hey. Hey, hey.

03:13.777 --> 03:17.072
I'm so sorry to ask. There doesn't
seem to be any insurance on file.

03:17.156 --> 03:19.199
Right. Um....

03:21.285 --> 03:22.661
Okay.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.333
Okay, Mr. Burkowitz.

03:30.252 --> 03:33.255
-Look, we can finish this up later.
-No, no, it's okay.

03:33.505 --> 03:36.842
We were just taking a shortcut
through the neighborhood...

03:37.092 --> 03:40.054
...and our windows were down
and we heard some screaming.

03:40.638 --> 03:43.599
-And we stopped, ran in.
-You found the kids in the basement?

03:43.849 --> 03:45.809
-Yeah.
-Well, thank God you did.

03:47.353 --> 03:50.314
-Excuse me.
OFFICER: Sure. Thanks for your help.

03:50.522 --> 03:53.692
-Hey, doc. Is he--? And?
-He's resting.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.320
The electrocution triggered
a heart attack.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.113
Pretty massive, I'm afraid.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.865
His heart, it's damaged.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.369
-How damaged?
-We've done all we can.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.538
We can try and keep him comfortable
at this point...

04:06.747 --> 04:10.250
...but I give him a couple weeks at most,
maybe a month.

04:10.501 --> 04:14.463
No, no, there's gotta be something
you can do, some kind of treatment.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.340
We can't work miracles.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.301
I really am sorry.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.230
Have you ever actually watched
daytime TV?

04:31.480 --> 04:33.190
It's terrible.

04:34.733 --> 04:35.859
(SIGHS)

04:36.110 --> 04:37.444
I talked to your doctor.

04:37.695 --> 04:41.323
That fabric softener teddy bear. Ooh.
I'm gonna hunt that little bitch down.

04:41.573 --> 04:44.743
-Dean.
-Yeah.

04:45.411 --> 04:48.706
All right, well, looks like you're gonna
leave town without me.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.667
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna leave you here.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.920
You're gonna take care of that car
or I swear I'll haunt your ass.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.965
-I don't think that's funny.
-Ah, come on, it's a little funny.

05:05.889 --> 05:08.726
Look, Sam, what can I say, man?
It's a dangerous gig.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.353
I drew the short straw.
That's it, end of story.

05:11.437 --> 05:12.813
Don't talk like that,
all right?

05:14.064 --> 05:16.400
-We still have options.
-What options?

05:16.608 --> 05:18.360
You got burial or cremation.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.071
I know it's not easy...

05:23.532 --> 05:25.367
...but I'm gonna die.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.454
And you can't stop it.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.916
Watch me.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.586
JOHN (ON MACHINE): This is
John Winchester. I can't be reached.

05:35.794 --> 05:41.300
If this is an emergency,
call my son, Dean, 866-907-3235.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.551
He can help.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.802
(MACHINE BEEPS)

05:44.011 --> 05:46.263
Hey, Dad, it's Sam. Uh....

05:47.139 --> 05:51.393
You probably won't even get this,
but it's Dean.

05:51.477 --> 05:56.190
He's sick and the doctor said
there's nothing they can do.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.192
Um....

05:59.276 --> 06:03.197
But they don't know
the things we know, right?

06:03.572 --> 06:08.994
So don't worry, because I'm gonna do
whatever it takes to get him better.

06:10.496 --> 06:13.874
All right, just wanted you to know.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.587
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

06:28.847 --> 06:31.266
-What the hell are you doing here?
-I checked myself out.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.018
Are you crazy?

06:33.227 --> 06:36.688
I'm not gonna die in a hospital
where the nurses aren't even hot.

06:37.356 --> 06:41.360
You know, this whole
"I laugh in the face of death" thing...

06:41.568 --> 06:44.488
...it's crap. I can see right through it.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.365
Yeah, whatever, dude.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.826
Have you even slept?
You look worse than me.

06:49.034 --> 06:52.246
I've been scouring the Internet
for the last three days.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.916
Calling every contact
in Dad's journal.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.544
-For what?
-For a way to help you.

06:58.794 --> 07:02.005
One of Dad's friends, Joshua,
he called me back.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.925
Told me about a guy in Nebraska.
A specialist.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.219
You're not gonna let me die in peace,
are you?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.264
I'm not gonna let you die, period.
We're going.

07:24.862 --> 07:26.572
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

07:36.248 --> 07:39.543
-I got you.
-I got it.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.879
Man, you're a lying bastard.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.672
You said we're going to see
a doctor.

07:43.922 --> 07:45.757
I believe I said a specialist.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.968
This guy's supposed to be
the real deal.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.513
I can't believe you brought me to see
some guy who heals people out of a tent.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.515
WOMAN: Reverend Le Grange
is a great man.

07:53.599 --> 07:54.641
Yeah, that's nice.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.935
I have a right to protest.
This man's a fraud.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.396
He's bilking all these people
out of their money.

07:59.605 --> 08:02.524
SHERIFF: Sir, this is a place of worship.
Let's go, move it.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.860
I take it he's not part of the flock.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.446
When people see what
they can't explain, there's controversy.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.698
But come on, Sam, a faith healer?

08:09.907 --> 08:12.784
Maybe it's time to have
a little faith, Dean.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.996
You know what I got faith in? Reality.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.207
Knowing what's really going on.

08:18.415 --> 08:21.335
How can you be a skeptic
with the things we see every day?

08:21.543 --> 08:23.253
Exactly. We see them.
We know they're real.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.423
SAM: If you know evil's out there,
how can you not believe good's out there?

08:26.506 --> 08:29.968
-I've seen what evil does to good people.
-Maybe God works in mysterious ways.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.512
Maybe he does.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.515
I think you turned me around
on the subject.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.476
Yeah, I'm sure.

08:37.684 --> 08:40.562
-I'm Dean, this is Sam.
-Layla.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.566
So if you're not a believer,
then why are you here?

08:44.816 --> 08:48.320
Well, apparently my brother here
believes enough for the both of us.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.156
-Come on, Layla, it's about to start.
-All right.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.033
LAYLA:
Bye.

08:53.742 --> 08:57.204
Well, I bet you she can work
in some mysterious ways.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.044

09:04.628 --> 09:07.214
Yeah, peace, love and trust all over.

committing some immoral...

...unspeakable act.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.597
-But I say to you: God is watching.
ALL: Yes, he is.

haven't you?

11:02.162 --> 11:05.082
Well, yeah, but--

11:05.332 --> 11:07.834
Maybe you should
just pick someone else.

11:10.545 --> 11:14.591
No, I didn't pick you, Dean,

-What do you mean, strange?

-No, they don't.

Why can't we be thankful the guy
saved your life and move on?

Because I can't shake this feeling,
that's why.

I saw someone, this old man.

I'm telling you, it was a spirit.

If there was something there,
I would've seen it too.

an awful lot of things lately.

Oh, well, excuse me, psychic wonder.

You're gonna need
a little faith.

to trust a feeling like this.

Yeah, all right.
So, what do you want to do?

When did they start, the miracles?

14:30.620 --> 14:34.249
Doctors figured out I had cancer,
told me I had maybe a month.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.503
So we prayed for a miracle.

14:38.753 --> 14:43.842
I was weak, but I told Sue Ann,
"You just keep right on praying."

14:45.010 --> 14:46.761
I went into a coma.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.180
Doctors said I wouldn't wake up,
but I did...

14:49.389 --> 14:51.558
...and the cancer was gone.

14:52.601 --> 14:56.438
If it wasn't for these eyes,
no one would believe I'd ever had it.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.608
And suddenly you could heal people.

15:00.025 --> 15:02.611
I discovered it afterwards, yes.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.530
God's blessed me in many ways.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.407
And his flock just swelled overnight.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.618
And this is just the beginning.

-Of course you can.

Why? Why me?

Out of all the sick people,
why save me?

an important purpose, a job to do...

15:42.609 --> 15:44.402
...and it isn't finished.

15:47.197 --> 15:51.409
Telling you, he seemed healthy.
Swam every day, didn't smoke.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.496
You know, so a heart attack
just kind of seemed bizarre.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.123
You said he was running
right before he collapsed.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.875
Yeah, yeah, he was freaking out.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.336
Said that something was after him.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.630
-Did he say what?
-Well, thin air is what.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.882
I mean, there wasn't anything.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.635
All right, thanks.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.473
Hey, buddy, your clock's busted.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.142
Oh, yeah, we can't get it working.

16:16.351 --> 16:19.479
It just froze at 4:17.

16:19.688 --> 16:22.065
Is that the same time Marshall died?

16:22.273 --> 16:23.483
How'd you know?

16:27.487 --> 16:29.739
-Dean, hey.
-Hey.

16:30.448 --> 16:33.576
-How are you feeling?
-I feel good. Cured, I guess.

16:34.577 --> 16:37.330
-What are you doing here?
-You know, my mom...

16:37.580 --> 16:40.500
-...she wanted to talk to the Reverend.
-Layla.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.337
Yes, we're here again.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.297
Oh, I'm sorry, but Roy's resting.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.425
He won't be seeing
anyone else right now.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.968
ROURKE:
Sue Ann, please.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.471
This is our sixth time.
He's got to see us.

16:53.722 --> 16:57.142
Roy's well aware of Layla's situation
and he very much wants to help...

16:57.350 --> 17:00.228
...just as soon as the Lord allows.
Have faith, Mrs. Rourke.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.740
Why are you still even here?

17:11.990 --> 17:14.617
-You got what you wanted.
-Mom, stop.

17:15.744 --> 17:17.704
No, Layla, this is too much.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.665
We've been to every single service.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.585
If Roy would stop choosing
these strangers over you...

17:23.793 --> 17:25.795
...strangers who don't even believe.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.257
I just can't pray any harder.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.384
Layla, what's wrong?

17:35.013 --> 17:36.598
I have this thing.

17:36.681 --> 17:39.142
ROURKE:
It's a brain tumor.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.187
It's inoperable.

17:43.188 --> 17:46.024
In six months, the doctors say....

17:51.446 --> 17:52.822
I'm sorry.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.575
It's okay.

17:55.992 --> 17:59.704
ROURKE:
No, it isn't.

18:06.211 --> 18:08.630
Why do you deserve to live
more than my daughter?

18:38.952 --> 18:40.829
What did you find out?

18:42.205 --> 18:45.083
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry about what?

18:45.375 --> 18:48.670
Marshall Hall died at 4:17.

18:49.712 --> 18:50.839
(SAM SIGHS)

18:51.089 --> 18:53.716
-The exact time I was healed.
-Yeah.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.261
So I put together a list.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.721
Reverend Roy's healed six people
over the past year...

18:58.805 --> 19:00.682
...and I checked them
with the local obits.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.601
Every time someone was healed,
someone else died.

19:03.852 --> 19:07.772
And each time the victim died of the
same symptom Le Grange was healing.

19:07.856 --> 19:10.692
DEAN: Someone's healed of cancer,
someone else dies of cancer?

19:10.775 --> 19:16.406
SAM: Somehow Le Grange is trading
a life for another.

19:16.614 --> 19:18.032
Hello?

19:19.659 --> 19:24.122
Wait, wait, wait.
So Marshall Hall died to save me?

19:24.414 --> 19:27.917
Dean, the guy probably
would've died anyway...

19:28.209 --> 19:30.753
...and someone else
would've been healed.

19:33.464 --> 19:37.927
-You never should have brought me here.
-Dean, I was just trying to save your life.

19:38.219 --> 19:40.513
But, Sam, some guy is dead now
because of me.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.473
I didn't know.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.227
Pray with me, friends.

19:48.062 --> 19:51.441
SAM: The thing I don't understand is,
how is Roy doing it?

19:51.649 --> 19:53.943
How's he trading a life for a life?

19:54.235 --> 19:56.154
Roy is not doing it.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.157
Something else is doing it for him.

19:59.407 --> 20:02.911
SAM: What do you mean?
DEAN: The old man I saw on-stage.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.582
-I didn't want to believe it, but I knew it.
-What are you talking about?

20:08.082 --> 20:10.793
Only one thing can
give and take life like that.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.796
We're dealing with a reaper.

20:14.672 --> 20:15.715

20:24.349 --> 20:25.725
(SHRIEKS)

21:09.185 --> 21:10.937
(CHEERING)

21:17.694 --> 21:19.487
SAM: You really think it's
the Grim Reaper...

21:19.696 --> 21:22.490
...like, Angel of Death, collect your soul,
the whole deal?

21:22.699 --> 21:24.993
No, no, no, not the Reaper,
a reaper.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.453
There's reaper lore
in every culture on earth.

21:27.662 --> 21:30.957
Go by different names. It's possible
there's more than one of them.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.875
You said you saw a dude
in a suit.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.545
What, he should've been
working the black robe thing?

21:37.130 --> 21:39.090
You said it yourself
that the clock stopped.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.510
Reapers stop time.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.804
You can only see them
when they're coming at you...

21:45.013 --> 21:46.097
...which is why I could see it.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.683
-Maybe.
-There's nothing else it could be, Sam.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.935
The question is, how's Roy
controlling the thing?

21:51.728 --> 21:54.147
-That cross.
-What?

21:54.397 --> 21:57.108
There was this cross.
I noticed it in the church tent.

21:57.191 --> 21:58.651
I knew I'd seen it before.

22:01.738 --> 22:02.780
(CHUCKLES)

22:06.075 --> 22:07.827
Here.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.414
DEAN: A tarot?
-It makes sense.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.708
Tarot dates back to
the early Christian era...

22:13.958 --> 22:16.919
...when priests were using magic
and a few veered into the dark stuff:

22:17.128 --> 22:20.840
Necromancy and how to
push death away, how to cause it.

22:21.132 --> 22:23.760
So Roy's using black magic
to bind the reaper.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.095
If he is, he's riding the whirlwind.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.514
Like putting a dog leash
on a great white.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.565
Okay, then we stop Roy.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.984
-How?
-You know how.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.569
What the hell are you
talking about?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.112
We can't kill Roy.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.614
Sam, the guy's playing God.

22:44.822 --> 22:47.116
He's deciding who lives and dies.
That's a monster.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.327
No, we're not gonna kill
a human being, Dean.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.954
We do that,
we're no better than he is.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.665
Okay, so we can't kill Roy,
we can't kill death.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.459
Any bright ideas, college boy?

22:58.127 --> 23:02.048
Okay, if Roy's using some kind of
black spell on the reaper...

23:02.256 --> 23:05.718
...we gotta figure out what it is
and how to break it.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.485
If Roy's using a spell,
there might be a spell book.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.570
See if you can find it.
Hurry up too.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.031
Service starts in 15 minutes.
I'll try to stall Roy.

23:27.115 --> 23:30.201
-Roy Le Grange is a fraud. He's no healer.
-Amen, brother.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.245
-You keep up the good work.
-Thank you.

25:22.563 --> 25:24.190
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

25:26.567 --> 25:27.944
What do you got?

25:28.194 --> 25:30.154
Roy's choosing victims
he sees as immoral.

25:30.238 --> 25:33.157
And I think I know who's next
on his list. Remember that protestor?

25:33.366 --> 25:34.784
DEAN (ON PHONE): In the parking lot?
-Yeah.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.162
Yeah, I'll find him. But you can't let
Roy heal anyone, all right?

25:59.809 --> 26:02.520
Layla. Layla Rourke.
Come up here, child.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.188

-Mom. Thank you.
-I love you.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.283
Oh, man.

26:25.459 --> 26:28.004
Layla, listen to me.
You can't go up there.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.214
Why not? We've waited for months.

26:30.298 --> 26:31.841
You can't let Roy heal you.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.260
I don't understand.
Roy healed you, didn't he?

26:34.343 --> 26:35.970
Why won't you at least
let him try?

26:36.178 --> 26:38.222
If you do, something bad
is gonna happen.

26:38.431 --> 26:40.266
I can't explain.
I just need to you believe me.

26:40.474 --> 26:42.768
-Layla.
-Please.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.364
-I'm sorry.
-Layla. Layla!

26:55.614 --> 26:57.491
Dear child.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.036
You deserve this.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.495
ROY:
I knew the Lord was planning.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.456
I knew it was just a matter of time.

Help!

27:17.511 --> 27:19.221

27:39.909 --> 27:42.870
-Where is he?
-It's right there!

27:45.373 --> 27:47.166
Fine, come on.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.385
DEAN:
Fire!

27:57.468 --> 27:59.136
Hurry! Tent's on fire!

28:00.304 --> 28:02.473
Fire! Everybody get out of here!

28:02.723 --> 28:04.558

Please don't stop. Please?

28:09.480 --> 28:12.650
Please don't stop. Please!

in an orderly fashion...

28:17.405 --> 28:20.282
...and we'll figure out what's going on
out there and we'll come back--

28:20.491 --> 28:25.579
-I did it. I stopped Roy.
-David, I think it's okay.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.670
-No.
-Dean, it didn't work.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.922
The reaper's still coming.

28:38.801 --> 28:41.429
I'm telling you. I'm telling you,
it must not have worked.

28:41.512 --> 28:43.264
Roy must not be controlling
this thing.

28:43.556 --> 28:45.558
Well, then who the hell is?

28:46.475 --> 28:47.852

Thank God.

29:35.608 --> 29:38.402
I just don't understand.

29:38.861 --> 29:42.615
After everything we've done for you,
after Roy healed you.

29:44.617 --> 29:47.453
I'm just very, very disappointed, Dean.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.541
You can let him go.
I'm not gonna press charges.

29:52.625 --> 29:57.338
The Lord will deal with him
as he sees fit.

29:59.632 --> 30:03.928
We catch you around here again, we'll
put the fear of God in you, understand?

30:04.178 --> 30:07.556
Yes, sir, fear of God. Got it.

30:10.684 --> 30:12.436
Layla.

30:13.020 --> 30:16.732
Why would you do that, Dean?
And it could have been my only chance.

30:16.941 --> 30:20.277
-He's not a healer.
-He healed you.

30:22.571 --> 30:25.658
I know it doesn't seem fair
and I wish I could explain...

30:25.741 --> 30:27.826
...but Roy is not the answer,
I'm sorry.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.248
Goodbye, Dean.

30:38.254 --> 30:41.549
I wish you luck. I really do.

30:41.966 --> 30:44.385
Same to you.

30:48.681 --> 30:51.308
You deserved a lot more than me.

ROY: Private session tonight,
no interruptions.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.276
I give you my word,
I'll heal your daughter.

31:00.484 --> 31:03.696
Thank you, Reverend. God bless you.

31:08.284 --> 31:10.286
So Roy really believes.

31:11.745 --> 31:14.373
I don't think he has any idea
what his wife's doing.

31:14.582 --> 31:18.544
Well, I found this
hidden in their library.

31:18.627 --> 31:21.922
It's ancient. Written by a priest
who went dark side.

31:22.131 --> 31:25.259
There's a binding spell in here
for trapping a reaper.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.137
-Must be a hell of a spell.
-Yeah.

31:28.345 --> 31:31.557
You gotta build a black altar
with seriously dark stuff:

31:31.765 --> 31:33.726
Bones, human blood.

31:35.311 --> 31:37.980
To cross a line like that--
That preacher's wife....

31:38.647 --> 31:42.568
Black magic, murder. Evil.

31:43.152 --> 31:44.695
Desperate.

31:44.778 --> 31:47.656
Her husband was dying. She would've
done anything to save him.

31:47.740 --> 31:50.701
She was using the binding spell
to keep the reaper away from Roy.

31:51.619 --> 31:55.039
Cheating death, literally.

31:55.331 --> 31:57.750
Yeah, but Roy's alive,
so why's she still using the spell?

31:58.626 --> 32:01.837
Right. To force the reaper to kill people
she thinks are immoral.

32:05.007 --> 32:08.552
May God save us from half the people
who think they're doing God's work.

32:08.802 --> 32:10.304
We gotta break that spell, Dean.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.977
Sue Ann had a Coptic cross like this.
Once she dropped it...

32:17.186 --> 32:20.606
-...the reaper backed off.
-So you think we gotta find the cross...

32:20.814 --> 32:22.983
-...or destroy the altar?
-Maybe both?

32:24.985 --> 32:27.237
Whatever we do,
we'd better do it soon.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.448
Roy's healing Layla tonight.

32:42.211 --> 32:45.631
That's Layla's car.
She's already here.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.218
-Yeah.
-Dean....

32:49.468 --> 32:51.303
If Roy picked Layla
instead of me...

32:51.512 --> 32:53.514
-...she'd be healed right now.
-Dean, don't.

32:53.722 --> 32:57.643
And if she's not healed tonight,
she's gonna die in a couple months.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.521
What's happening to her is horrible...

33:00.729 --> 33:04.650
...but what are you gonna do?
Let somebody else die to save her?

33:04.733 --> 33:08.696
You said it yourself, Dean:
You can't play God.

33:23.419 --> 33:26.046
ROY: Gather around.
Please, everyone gather around.

33:26.255 --> 33:28.757
Come in closer, come on up.

33:28.841 --> 33:32.219
-Where's Sue Ann?
-House.

33:34.388 --> 33:35.806
Go find Sue Ann. I'll catch up.

33:35.889 --> 33:37.641
What are you--?

33:38.892 --> 33:42.896
Hey. Gonna put that
fear of God in me?

34:28.066 --> 34:31.945
-See him?
-No.

34:43.499 --> 34:45.000
(BARKING)

34:52.966 --> 34:55.344
Psycho mutt.

35:40.848 --> 35:43.684
I gave your brother life
and I can take it away.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.198
Sam, can't you see?

35:58.448 --> 36:02.911
The Lord chose me to reward the just
and punish the wicked...

36:02.995 --> 36:05.414
...and your brother is wicked...

36:05.664 --> 36:09.585
...and he deserves to die
just as Layla deserves to live.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.588
It's God's will.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.967
Goodbye, Sam.

36:21.263 --> 36:25.100
ROY:
Mrs. Rourke, pray with me now.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.185
Pray with me, friends.

37:00.594 --> 37:02.596
ROY:
All right now.

37:03.180 --> 37:05.390
All right now.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.101
(CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

37:14.024 --> 37:15.525
(GROANING)

37:47.140 --> 37:48.475
SUE ANN:
Oh!

37:59.528 --> 38:02.906
-I don't understand.
-I don't feel different.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.452
My God. What have you done?

38:08.245 --> 38:09.621
He's not your God.

38:10.330 --> 38:13.500
-Reverend?
-Sue Ann?

38:13.583 --> 38:15.836
(GASPING)

39:00.589 --> 39:02.507
You okay?

39:02.716 --> 39:04.593
Hell of a week.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.303
Yeah.

39:07.596 --> 39:11.058
All right, come on.
We should get going.

39:22.527 --> 39:25.989
-What is it?
-Nothing.

39:28.241 --> 39:29.534
What is it?

39:29.618 --> 39:32.704
-We did the right thing here, didn't we?
-Of course we did.

39:33.538 --> 39:34.998
It doesn't feel like it.

39:35.290 --> 39:36.625
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

39:37.084 --> 39:38.543
I got it.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.341
-Hey, Layla, come on in.
-Hey.

39:45.926 --> 39:50.597
Hey. How did you know
we were here?

39:50.680 --> 39:55.185
Sam called. He said you wanted
to say goodbye.

39:56.269 --> 39:57.687
SAM:
I'm gonna grab a soda.

40:04.111 --> 40:08.406
So where are you going?

40:08.990 --> 40:14.037
Oh, don't know yet. Our work
kind of takes us all over. So....

40:16.581 --> 40:21.962
-You know, I went back to see Roy.
-What happened?

40:25.006 --> 40:26.842
Nothing.

40:27.050 --> 40:31.346
I mean, he laid his hands on my forehead
but nothing happened.

40:33.390 --> 40:34.766
I'm sorry.

40:35.684 --> 40:38.061
I'm sorry it didn't work.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.605
And Sue Ann....

40:40.814 --> 40:44.067
She's dead, you know? Stroke.

40:44.484 --> 40:46.570
Yeah, I heard.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.407
You know, Roy's a good man.

40:51.241 --> 40:53.785
He doesn't deserve
what's happened.

40:57.497 --> 41:01.960
It must be rough
to believe in something so much...

41:02.169 --> 41:04.838
...and have it disappoint you like that.

41:09.759 --> 41:12.387
You wanna hear something weird?

41:12.846 --> 41:13.972
Hmm?

41:14.681 --> 41:17.350
I'm okay. Really.

41:18.727 --> 41:21.521
I guess if you're gonna have faith...

41:21.730 --> 41:24.608
...you can't just have it
when the miracles happen.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.860
You have to have it when they don't.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.244
So, what now?

41:40.665 --> 41:43.835
God works in mysterious ways.

41:49.216 --> 41:50.550
Goodbye, Dean.

41:53.094 --> 41:54.763
Hey....

42:00.101 --> 42:02.854
You know, I'm not much
of the praying type...

42:06.233 --> 42:08.068
...but I'm gonna pray for you.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.906
Well...

42:13.114 --> 42:15.700
...there's a miracle right there.
