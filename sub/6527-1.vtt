01:45.323 --> 01:46.745
Yae-bin, wake up!

01:47.868 --> 01:50.667
It's time to get ready.

02:12.768 --> 02:14.020
Can you get the news?

02:19.357 --> 02:20.984
You guys should go see grandma in hospital.

02:20.984 --> 02:22.406
I'm done.

02:22.694 --> 02:24.116
Aren't you going to finish?

02:26.573 --> 02:27.825
Did you hear me?

02:31.036 --> 02:35.132
Why don't you buy handbags for you and your mother?

02:44.549 --> 02:45.801
You want one too?

02:46.718 --> 02:48.186
Love you, Dad.

02:55.977 --> 02:58.230
Call your grandma, at least.

03:06.404 --> 03:13.162
This slimy thing here is very good for your husband...

03:17.791 --> 03:20.260
A terrible incident happened to a high school girl...

04:21.438 --> 04:22.940
- Hello. - Hi.

04:23.064 --> 04:25.283
- Here. - Oh, don't...

04:25.275 --> 04:27.198
- It's nothing. - Thank you.

04:28.236 --> 04:30.409
Why did you tempt me? Because I'm the boss's daughter?

04:30.405 --> 04:32.328
Of course I love it.

04:32.657 --> 04:34.250
It's Chanel.

04:38.622 --> 04:41.842
Don't worry. Go back to work.

04:45.795 --> 04:48.298
Hey, hey!

04:48.757 --> 04:50.759
My son-in-law bought me

04:51.009 --> 04:52.511
Chanel!

04:57.599 --> 05:00.352
I guess buying out companies is not easy.

05:01.978 --> 05:06.199
Who knew your husband would be so successful!

05:06.942 --> 05:09.161
And how your brother would turn out.

05:09.945 --> 05:14.075
In college he was all labor union, blah blah blah-

05:16.743 --> 05:19.417
Life is ironic.

05:19.663 --> 05:23.293
Using fancy words now?

05:24.876 --> 05:27.470
Guess I'm becoming a Seoulite.

05:28.880 --> 05:30.382
Please don't say they're siblings.

05:30.590 --> 05:31.933
We're siblings.

05:32.801 --> 05:35.554
- What? No way. - It doesn't make sense.

05:38.098 --> 05:41.102
See? I told you!

05:41.476 --> 05:42.568
Thank you.

05:46.439 --> 05:48.908
- When did this start? - She was OK this morning.

05:50.902 --> 05:51.903
Hang on a sec!

05:55.073 --> 05:57.075
HA CHUN-HWA

06:51.296 --> 06:53.298
- Do you need money? - Why are you there?

06:53.298 --> 06:56.302
- Dad gave you this morning. - Why are you there?

06:56.301 --> 06:58.895
If you need money, just ask. Don't sneak like that.

06:58.887 --> 07:01.811
Who says I'm sneaking? I thought you were sleeping!

07:01.973 --> 07:04.476
Is something wrong?

07:05.101 --> 07:07.149
I thought it was a real book!

07:07.270 --> 07:10.149
Is there something wrong?

07:11.316 --> 07:12.693
You're the only one.

07:13.234 --> 07:16.534
At that age, everything's turmoil and a passionate encounter.

07:16.529 --> 07:23.037
She has to sacrifice everything despite her feelings because

07:23.244 --> 07:24.416
she's a mother.

07:25.163 --> 07:27.837
It's just a drama.

07:28.333 --> 07:34.340
You think you grew up without any troubles?

07:34.881 --> 07:37.179
I wasn't a big troublemaker.

07:37.467 --> 07:41.392
No you weren't. You were a huge troublemaker.

07:42.388 --> 07:44.061
They're not gonna kill her, are they?

07:44.140 --> 07:45.562
I only have a month.

07:47.060 --> 07:56.117
- What the hell? - I knew it! I knew it!

08:12.001 --> 08:13.253
Is someone there?

08:19.050 --> 08:21.178
No one?

08:28.893 --> 08:33.990
I'm just looking at you.

08:39.611 --> 08:41.239
I'm just

08:42.115 --> 08:45.961
watching you.

08:53.543 --> 08:55.295
What do doctors say?

08:56.171 --> 09:00.301
Maybe two more months...?

09:02.218 --> 09:03.561
Does it hurt a lot?

09:05.513 --> 09:06.730
Well...

09:08.057 --> 09:10.901
it's like thousands of needles...

09:11.477 --> 09:12.945
drilling you

09:14.647 --> 09:16.274
at the same time.

09:25.617 --> 09:26.960
IM Na-mi!

09:28.119 --> 09:32.249
Why are you still so pretty?

09:33.625 --> 09:34.968
HA Chun-hwa!

09:37.754 --> 09:40.052
You're not bad either for a cancer patient.

09:51.559 --> 09:52.606
Hello?

09:54.020 --> 09:55.192
Tomorrow?

09:56.022 --> 09:57.569
For how long?

09:58.566 --> 10:00.318
Two months?

10:04.239 --> 10:06.367
Alright.

10:10.536 --> 10:14.336
My husband is going on a business trip.

10:14.666 --> 10:17.340
You should go.

10:18.169 --> 10:22.174
I'll visit often. Do you need any help?

10:23.132 --> 10:24.554
Don't worry.

10:32.392 --> 10:34.736
I thought of something!

10:35.061 --> 10:36.688
Tell me.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.528
I miss them.

10:44.904 --> 10:46.326
Who?

10:47.740 --> 10:49.117
Sunny.

10:51.202 --> 10:55.332
I want to see them before I die.

11:08.344 --> 11:11.268
When did you get your checkup?

11:12.682 --> 11:13.774
The other day...

11:15.893 --> 11:19.773
Didn't your uncle die of cancer?

11:20.648 --> 11:21.900
Or was it his wife?

11:23.026 --> 11:25.120
Did you get an insurance sales call?

11:30.408 --> 11:33.457
Bumped into an old friend at the hospital.

11:34.370 --> 11:37.840
Late-stage lung cancer.

11:39.417 --> 11:41.545
You have an old friend?

11:41.669 --> 11:43.171
From high school.

11:47.759 --> 11:50.137
Didn't I tell you that I belonged to a clique?

11:52.638 --> 11:53.981
Honey.

11:57.435 --> 11:58.778
Na-mi.

11:59.479 --> 12:00.651
What!

12:04.067 --> 12:06.536
Shall we try for another baby?

12:09.947 --> 12:11.915
My period has stopped.

12:22.877 --> 12:25.801
Take your pills everyday and be careful.

12:25.797 --> 12:28.641
Yae-bin has hers. This is yours.

12:31.469 --> 12:32.846
I have money.

12:33.388 --> 12:36.483
Spend some time with your friend. She doesn't have much left.

12:37.350 --> 12:39.648
I have to help Yae-bin with her exams.

12:43.147 --> 12:44.364
Take care.

12:47.318 --> 12:48.535
Take care, sir!

12:51.447 --> 12:53.791
Downtown is usually the best route around now.

12:56.994 --> 12:59.543
But today...

13:02.542 --> 13:04.260
Stop cutting in, you fool!

13:04.627 --> 13:05.844
Mr. Bong?

13:21.352 --> 13:22.353
Sorry.

13:26.399 --> 13:27.867
What the...?

14:13.571 --> 14:14.572
I'm sorry.

14:15.072 --> 14:17.200
Wanna get your ass kicked?

14:20.411 --> 14:21.412
Piss off.

14:22.413 --> 14:24.586
Hey guys, Su-mi's here!

14:33.424 --> 14:34.550
Attention!

14:36.677 --> 14:37.769
Bow.

14:37.929 --> 14:39.431
Good morning, teacher?

14:41.265 --> 14:42.482
Whose seat is that?

14:42.475 --> 14:44.318
Chun-hwa went to the toilet.

14:44.310 --> 14:46.733
Jang-mi, please don't talk while sleeping.

14:46.729 --> 14:47.901
You're scaring my baby.

14:48.064 --> 14:49.236
I'm not sleeping.

14:49.232 --> 14:51.030
Are you still bowing, then?

14:52.360 --> 14:56.410
This is a new transfer student, IM...

14:56.614 --> 14:59.709
Na-mi. She's from Beolgyo, Jeolla-do.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.998
It's her first time in Seoul. So be nice to her.

15:01.994 --> 15:04.417
- Okay, Jang-mi? - Yep.

15:05.915 --> 15:06.962
Introduce yourself.

15:10.962 --> 15:14.432
It's nice to meet y'all.

15:15.466 --> 15:16.683
You.

15:16.926 --> 15:21.853
I'm IM Na-mi from New Beolgyo High.

15:26.477 --> 15:28.104
Go sit over there.

15:31.649 --> 15:33.196
Let's see...

15:33.859 --> 15:38.865
The slogan of the month is "anti-communism".

15:39.156 --> 15:42.501
And why are there cigarette butts in girl's high school?

15:42.577 --> 15:45.000
You can't make pretty babies if you smoke.

15:45.288 --> 15:48.588
I trust we don't have smokers in out class.

15:48.833 --> 15:49.925
Attention!

15:51.627 --> 15:52.503
Bow.

15:52.503 --> 15:54.471
Thank you, teacher.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.933
Hey, y'all!

16:07.852 --> 16:12.153
Where's Beolgyo? Oh, the place with cookies?

16:12.356 --> 16:14.575
Let me see. Did you bring cookies for lunch?

16:15.234 --> 16:16.952
I didn't bring lunch.

16:17.028 --> 16:19.201
Give her a break.

16:19.739 --> 16:22.458
Hey, change your seat with that girl over there.

16:22.867 --> 16:24.915
She smells like menstruation.

16:25.745 --> 16:28.965
Teacher told me to sit here.

16:29.040 --> 16:33.887
Listen or you'll regret.

16:33.878 --> 16:34.879
Hey.

16:34.962 --> 16:36.054
Get lost.

16:36.213 --> 16:39.387
- You're gutsy today. - I always had big guts.

16:40.343 --> 16:42.186
Hey, chill out guys.

16:42.928 --> 16:46.603
Aren't you going? Some choices are important...

16:47.558 --> 16:49.731
- What the f--! - Get your ass off now!

16:52.063 --> 16:53.235
I'm sorry.

17:03.240 --> 17:04.162
Who's this?

17:04.367 --> 17:05.664
New kid.

17:06.868 --> 17:08.587
- Where's she from? - Beolgyo.

17:08.579 --> 17:11.583
The town of cockies. She didn't bring lunch.

17:12.583 --> 17:15.678
- What's her name? - IM Na-mi.

17:15.752 --> 17:19.132
- Na-mi? Just like the singer? - Yep.

17:19.256 --> 17:21.930
I'm Chun-hwa. Just like the singer, HA Chun-hwa.

17:22.801 --> 17:25.430
- Nice to meet you, Na-mi. - Nice to meet ya too!

17:31.769 --> 17:32.986
Do I look weird?

17:37.525 --> 17:39.198
Ok. it's weird.

17:56.419 --> 17:58.012
Stop staring.

18:14.979 --> 18:16.526
Let's go eat!

18:34.582 --> 18:38.587
Happy lunch time, Jinduk! I'm your DJ KIM,

18:38.669 --> 18:45.143
with perfect songs to assist your digestion.

18:46.594 --> 18:50.895
The first song is by Cyndi Lauper.

18:51.015 --> 18:53.894
Girls Just Want to Have Fun.

19:13.162 --> 19:15.039
Hey "singer" buddy, let's go have lunch.

19:18.793 --> 19:21.296
You're eating again, fatso?

19:21.295 --> 19:23.297
Just a bun.

19:23.422 --> 19:24.423
Who's that?

19:24.882 --> 19:28.432
New kid, Na-mi. This is HWANG Jin-hee.

19:28.427 --> 19:31.727
Her dad's a Korean Lit. prof, but she majors in swearwords.

19:32.056 --> 19:33.729
Bitch's sayin' shit.

19:34.099 --> 19:36.227
- Where you from? - Beolgyo, Jeolla-do.

19:36.685 --> 19:38.483
Do people there really swear a lot?

19:38.479 --> 19:39.776
Why, you wanna go study?

19:39.772 --> 19:40.989
- Yup. - Bye.

19:41.065 --> 19:43.909
Hey, Geum-ok! Four more salad buns!

19:44.068 --> 19:45.911
Ok, four more!

19:46.070 --> 19:49.324
Geum-ok is the only child of Dentist Seo.

19:49.740 --> 19:53.711
She's a bookworm with a "big stick."

19:55.663 --> 19:57.540
What's a "big stick"?

20:00.918 --> 20:02.795
It's healthy to let out anger.

20:02.795 --> 20:04.889
Chun-hwa!

20:07.424 --> 20:09.722
Look at that. A walking poodle.

20:09.969 --> 20:10.891
Let's go.

20:12.555 --> 20:15.058
How many bottles of perm lotion did you use?

20:15.057 --> 20:16.559
Guess you don't want double eyelid tapes?

20:16.559 --> 20:17.685
You're so pretty!

20:19.395 --> 20:21.818
Are you new? Nice to meet you!

20:21.981 --> 20:24.951
I'm the future Miss Korea.

20:25.109 --> 20:27.282
Go read a book, airhead.

20:27.278 --> 20:29.246
- Stop being bitchy. - Whatever.

20:29.238 --> 20:32.162
When you're a Miss Korea, double eyelids at your salon, huh?

20:32.157 --> 20:33.500
Of course.

20:33.659 --> 20:35.582
Where's that Su-ji bitch?

20:35.786 --> 20:38.505
Smoking for diet.

20:38.497 --> 20:39.794
This.

20:41.292 --> 20:42.965
Remember the pretty girl in our class?

20:42.960 --> 20:45.804
- She's our possy, too. - Salad buns are here!

20:45.921 --> 20:46.888
Yeah!

20:47.047 --> 20:48.640
What's up with that ribbon?

20:49.466 --> 20:51.468
Are you the new kid? Hi, I'm Geum-ok.

20:54.513 --> 20:57.562
Wow, what are those shoes?

20:57.641 --> 21:00.815
- They're "Specs"! - What's "Specs"'?

21:05.149 --> 21:08.619
Why's my daughter so quiet?

21:12.781 --> 21:19.460
You're in good school thanks to dad's boss.

21:19.663 --> 21:21.711
Did you make many pals?

21:22.333 --> 21:26.429
Stop talkin' to me. I needn't use the dialect.

21:27.087 --> 21:30.341
You don't use dialect. You sound like a Seoul kid.

21:31.383 --> 21:39.859
Mom, nobody wears "Specs". Only Nike or Pro-specs.

21:40.434 --> 21:42.232
And Jordache jeans...

21:43.687 --> 21:46.657
You know how many hours some kids have to work in factories

21:46.649 --> 21:48.617
to buy a pair of shoes?

21:48.734 --> 21:50.577
Of course she doesn't know.

21:50.653 --> 21:53.623
That's the problem, Ma.

21:53.948 --> 21:59.296
As the new ruling class, we workers need to stand up

21:59.828 --> 22:01.830
against the Fascist hegemony, and the Yankee capitalist.

22:02.998 --> 22:11.975
Dad, you need to stop workin' for the dictator like a slave.

22:12.049 --> 22:13.301
Slave?

22:16.220 --> 22:17.392
Employee.

22:17.721 --> 22:18.938
You asshole.

22:19.306 --> 22:26.064
Make your own money if you don't want mine.

22:26.563 --> 22:30.409
But if you want my money,

22:31.485 --> 22:34.739
shut up and just go to school.

22:35.447 --> 22:37.165
Don't do anything stupid.

22:37.157 --> 22:39.501
- Dad! - Shut up.

22:39.868 --> 22:42.747
Life is short and revolution ls forever.

22:42.830 --> 22:46.676
Fuckin' sap sucker! Who's sayin' life's short?

22:46.750 --> 22:51.750
Fuck that filthy mouth filled with whistledickin' shit.

22:57.428 --> 23:03.276
No blamin' the bitches for playin' the game.

23:03.392 --> 23:09.274
It doesn't matter. Y'all's gotta make babes when y'all's 18.

23:13.444 --> 23:17.119
Sis, give me more soup.

23:28.125 --> 23:29.126
Duty student?

23:30.627 --> 23:31.799
Duty student?

23:33.547 --> 23:34.514
Read it.

23:35.090 --> 23:37.559
- Excuse me... - You can go to the toilet after.

23:37.634 --> 23:40.979
I think it's unfair to always pick on the duty student.

23:40.971 --> 23:42.598
Okay. Sit.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.062
Then how about student #12?

23:45.559 --> 23:48.608
I think your double eyelids are unfair.

23:48.687 --> 23:51.031
It's not good for my baby.

23:51.190 --> 23:52.157
Sit.

23:52.816 --> 23:53.942
Na-mi.

23:58.697 --> 24:00.870
Deung Hwa Ga Chin.

24:01.325 --> 24:04.249
It's good to have a candlelight near

24:04.995 --> 24:10.843
It means good time to study.

24:11.835 --> 24:16.682
Na-mi, you were a top student in your old school.

24:17.508 --> 24:19.602
And won many awards in art contests.

24:21.804 --> 24:23.181
Be quiet!

24:25.057 --> 24:26.525
Do you want to go to an art school?

24:26.725 --> 24:28.898
I'm not sure.

24:28.894 --> 24:32.524
Come and get the art contest application form after class.

24:32.689 --> 24:33.690
Okay.

24:34.358 --> 24:36.281
Jang-mi should come too.

24:36.527 --> 24:38.529
I'll make you triple eyelids.

24:59.091 --> 25:00.263
Ma'am?

25:06.515 --> 25:10.236
How come you didn't age?

25:11.061 --> 25:12.483
Did you get a plastic surgery?

25:14.940 --> 25:16.908
You look the same too.

25:16.900 --> 25:19.619
I'm going to be a grandma next month.

25:20.696 --> 25:24.917
Got pregnant before marriage. It's a new trend.

25:27.286 --> 25:30.165
Hey, you come here. You changed your eyes!

25:30.414 --> 25:32.087
Let me see. Close your eyes.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.752
They look nice. Go on.

25:34.751 --> 25:36.799
- Thank you. - Ah, right.

25:38.755 --> 25:41.929
Jang-mi also came to visit.

25:42.009 --> 25:43.761
She left her name card with me...

25:44.928 --> 25:46.851
WOORI LIFE INSURANCE

25:46.847 --> 25:49.942
Look at this.

25:51.268 --> 25:54.738
Looks good, huh?

25:54.813 --> 25:58.613
Mrs. Kwak, much better than the last month.

25:58.817 --> 26:02.993
And Mrs. Kim, you need to try harder than this.

26:03.447 --> 26:09.454
Everybody applause. Mrs. Koh is the sales queen of the month!

26:09.995 --> 26:12.123
Mrs. Kim...

26:14.458 --> 26:16.711
- Mrs. Kim Jang-mi? - Yes.

26:16.877 --> 26:19.255
- You know what I'll say. - Yes.

26:19.796 --> 26:21.469
Try harder.

26:21.715 --> 26:22.967
I will.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.519
You put too much effort into your eyelids.

26:25.969 --> 26:29.348
It's unfair to pick on me like that.

26:29.348 --> 26:34.650
I think this is unfair.

26:35.437 --> 26:38.486
Stop laughing. This isn't funny.

26:38.607 --> 26:40.826
Next is Mrs...

26:50.494 --> 26:53.213
This is KIM Jang-mi speaking.

26:56.083 --> 27:01.931
Haven't seen you for 25 years and you're already dying.

27:03.173 --> 27:05.221
You bitch.

27:12.140 --> 27:13.938
Do you have life insurance?

27:14.351 --> 27:17.605
Who would've guessed that I'd end up selling insurance?

27:17.771 --> 27:21.196
My husband lost all our money on business.

27:21.525 --> 27:23.778
Good thing you got divorced.

27:25.404 --> 27:28.374
Still, how can he not show up? Your husband.

27:30.075 --> 27:34.376
With no kids, we're as good as strangers.

27:35.497 --> 27:37.124
Aren't you lonely, though?

27:39.459 --> 27:41.757
I was completely consumed with work.

27:43.130 --> 27:46.225
Now I look back, I guess I was.

27:47.801 --> 27:53.058
Hey, insurance lady, don't have a hot guy for me?

27:53.265 --> 27:56.860
I could use some scorching love affair before I pass.

27:56.935 --> 27:59.939
I'm loaded and terminal. Not a bad deal, huh?

28:03.942 --> 28:06.866
Right back atcha, bitch!

28:08.071 --> 28:14.545
Let's find them. Chun-hwa's paying for the fee.

28:15.245 --> 28:17.748
Don't you miss them?

28:17.956 --> 28:19.833
I need to take care of my family.

28:19.833 --> 28:22.552
What, they can't take care of themselves?

28:23.253 --> 28:26.257
Don't bother. I'll find them alone.

28:26.715 --> 28:28.467
How?

28:29.301 --> 28:31.269
It takes about a month to find

28:31.261 --> 28:34.014
four people, no matter where they live.

28:34.431 --> 28:38.527
And you already know the price.

28:41.563 --> 28:43.611
My wife shrunk my shirt.

28:45.108 --> 28:47.110
We also accept credit cards...

28:51.365 --> 28:52.366
Excuse me.

28:53.617 --> 28:55.369
I told you to stay inside!

28:55.369 --> 29:00.000
He found me and my husband

29:00.374 --> 29:02.877
when we were hiding from our creditors.

29:03.794 --> 29:06.263
Oh, the memories...

29:06.671 --> 29:07.923
You like that?

29:09.299 --> 29:12.678
Anyway, he's good at finding people.

29:14.137 --> 29:19.314
Some acting's necessary in order to make it look

29:19.393 --> 29:23.899
more "natural" because...

29:23.897 --> 29:24.989
Excuse me.

29:30.070 --> 29:33.540
So that was planned acting too?

29:34.574 --> 29:35.871
That's on the back.

29:38.370 --> 29:40.919
- Why didn't you wake me'?! - Eat this. One bite.

29:40.914 --> 29:41.961
Socks!

29:42.791 --> 29:44.964
Get up when I wake you! Here.

29:46.294 --> 29:48.717
Why don't you give me panties too?

29:52.134 --> 29:56.105
You've got diabetes. You gotta eat, Na-mi!

29:56.096 --> 29:59.771
I know! Why didn't you wake me up?

29:59.766 --> 30:01.393
Don't feed her.

30:01.393 --> 30:04.192
The revolutionaries are starving in jail.

30:04.187 --> 30:06.986
Shut up. You're the one who's eating.

30:07.065 --> 30:10.865
Fuck! I don't want to eat.

30:10.861 --> 30:13.159
Mom, grow up!

30:13.155 --> 30:16.079
- Where's my jacket? - Laundry!

30:16.074 --> 30:17.246
Oh gosh.

30:18.201 --> 30:19.874
Move Dad!

30:21.580 --> 30:23.708
She's late again.

30:25.041 --> 30:27.385
Yum, that looks good.

30:28.211 --> 30:30.384
Where's my tool bag?

30:30.380 --> 30:32.257
I'm late!

30:33.175 --> 30:33.596
TOOL BAG

30:33.592 --> 30:35.686
Study this for your exam.

30:35.677 --> 30:37.224
Study this for your exam.

30:38.388 --> 30:39.731
We're done for the day.

30:42.142 --> 30:45.271
Your teacher's having a baby today.

30:45.479 --> 30:48.824
Have a safe weekend. Don't play too hard.

30:48.815 --> 30:50.237
Okay.

30:59.034 --> 31:01.628
Thank you, Jang-mi.

31:04.789 --> 31:07.133
The day has come!

31:07.125 --> 31:08.627
You guys all brought "tools"'?

31:08.877 --> 31:09.753
I only brought this.

31:09.753 --> 31:11.755
You go fight with that, crazy.

31:11.755 --> 31:13.223
What the hell are you doing?

31:13.215 --> 31:15.058
Sorry. I forgot, too.

31:15.759 --> 31:17.432
Shit, this isn't good.

31:18.094 --> 31:21.064
Do we need seven of us to fight with seven of them?

31:21.056 --> 31:24.310
They changed their name to a suckier one.

31:24.309 --> 31:27.108
- Let's get changed first! - Okay, okay! What's that?

31:27.103 --> 31:30.323
- Isn't this so pretty? - Oh my god, that's perfect!

31:45.580 --> 31:47.298
Why are we taking her?

31:49.459 --> 31:51.507
Just to show them we also have seven.

31:51.795 --> 31:58.178
We usually don't fight for real but you can hide at the back.

31:59.344 --> 32:03.224
Let's fight for real! We have many tools!

32:05.433 --> 32:11.486
Do you have anything to eat?

32:11.815 --> 32:12.987
Not really.

32:13.900 --> 32:17.279
Hey, do I look like a walking lunch box to you?

32:18.989 --> 32:22.710
Don't go without returning your shoes, ma'am.

32:24.828 --> 32:26.501
Fuck. They're already here.

32:26.830 --> 32:29.003
Girls' Generation!

32:43.722 --> 32:45.816
HA Chun-hwa.

32:46.099 --> 32:52.402
Why do we have to fight like the tigers of Serengeti?

32:52.689 --> 32:54.441
Learn to share.

32:54.524 --> 32:58.199
Not before you stop stealing from our kids.

32:58.612 --> 33:04.870
Besides it's lions, not tigers, you idiot.

33:04.951 --> 33:06.749
There must be some tigers in Serengeti.

33:09.539 --> 33:12.258
Who's that?

33:13.543 --> 33:15.887
You brought a kid to scare us?

33:16.212 --> 33:19.386
Looks like she wants to pee!

33:19.716 --> 33:22.219
I wasn't gonna bring her, but...

33:22.927 --> 33:27.182
Have you heard of "possession"'?

33:28.558 --> 33:34.406
Of course. Sitting, lying, squatting...

33:34.397 --> 33:36.570
Not position, you fool. "Possession."

33:36.566 --> 33:38.239
What the fuck is that?

33:38.568 --> 33:40.536
Possessed by spirits.

33:41.279 --> 33:43.031
Spirit possession.

33:43.573 --> 33:47.669
She's actually quite famous in her old town.

33:47.869 --> 33:51.089
Look how she's shaking? That's preparing.

33:51.915 --> 33:54.088
Preparing for what?

33:54.584 --> 33:55.585
Ghost.

33:56.002 --> 33:59.302
She doesn't weer socks because she walks on knife every morning.

33:59.547 --> 34:00.924
Don't look her in the eyes.

34:02.467 --> 34:03.514
You'll get possessed.

34:06.471 --> 34:08.098
Yeah, right.

34:24.572 --> 34:27.871
Do you know you always look like a pasta plate?

34:28.326 --> 34:30.078
Why don't you take off your helmet?

34:30.954 --> 34:33.581
Why don't you spit out those ping pong balls first?

34:33.915 --> 34:36.293
Your cheekbones can kill people.

34:41.339 --> 34:43.262
Wow, you crazy bitch.

34:43.757 --> 34:45.760
You have a very filthy mouth.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.889
Not more than your face.

34:49.304 --> 34:50.931
What a special haybag you are.

34:50.931 --> 34:53.435
And you're extra special.

34:54.686 --> 34:55.938
You fucking mother fucker.

34:55.937 --> 34:57.985
You fucking mother fucker sucker!

35:00.692 --> 35:04.572
You horn dog, I'll eat you alive!

35:04.738 --> 35:06.411
Right back atcha!

35:07.991 --> 35:12.667
Go away if you're gonna shake like that.

35:12.662 --> 35:13.834
- You shitface. - You shitface.

35:13.830 --> 35:17.505
Jinx! I'm getting bored.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.002
- You... - What?

35:19.794 --> 35:22.673
- Sh... - Shiznit?

35:23.006 --> 35:24.303
You skanky shiznit twat!

35:24.299 --> 35:27.473
Bitch! That was mine!

35:27.886 --> 35:30.014
Fucking bitches.

35:30.096 --> 35:36.775
You bunch of sap sucking lard buckets!

35:36.770 --> 35:41.697
Fuck that filthy mouth filled with whistledickin' shit.

35:41.775 --> 35:47.202
No blamin' the bitches for playin' the game.

35:47.197 --> 35:50.201
It doesn't matter. Y'all's gotta make babes when y'all's 18.

35:50.200 --> 35:54.706
I should've eaten somthing. Mom, I ain't gonna sleep late.

35:54.829 --> 35:58.550
Granny snorin's too loud, I sleeped no more!

35:58.541 --> 36:00.134
You peckerheads!

36:08.510 --> 36:11.059
Wow, it's already time to watch MTV.

36:21.064 --> 36:22.281
I'm hungry.

36:38.248 --> 36:43.129
I'm just looking at you

36:44.546 --> 36:49.302
I'm just watching you

36:50.635 --> 36:55.635
I can never say I love you

37:03.106 --> 37:07.486
I'm just looking at you

37:11.781 --> 37:14.330
What should I do?

37:14.325 --> 37:18.205
I just go round and round

37:20.373 --> 37:24.674
I want to get a private lesson from your granny too!

37:25.712 --> 37:29.012
I feel so old!

37:32.802 --> 37:34.975
Hey girls!

37:35.138 --> 37:38.267
I think it's time to accept our seventh member.

37:38.266 --> 37:41.190
- Who? - Na-mi.

37:41.269 --> 37:44.364
- Seven's better than six. - Lucky!

37:46.149 --> 37:49.995
Everybody agree to accept Na-mi as our new member?

37:49.986 --> 37:53.707
- Agreed! - Seconded!

37:53.698 --> 37:55.541
Positive, ma'am!

37:59.871 --> 38:00.997
Whatever.

38:03.082 --> 38:06.928
Now that we're seven, let's make a fucking name.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.888
- Cool. - Stop swearing, crazy bitch.

38:09.172 --> 38:11.266
I like "crazy bitch".

38:11.257 --> 38:13.510
Crazy Bitches?

38:13.801 --> 38:15.724
Hey, how's "Wonder Girls?"

38:15.720 --> 38:18.269
Like "Wonder Woman". Never mind.

38:18.514 --> 38:21.017
That's so cheesy.

38:21.017 --> 38:23.691
- And "Crazy Bitches" is creative? - Eat this.

38:30.193 --> 38:31.194
Oh my god.

38:32.028 --> 38:34.531
You scare me, little sis.

38:35.073 --> 38:38.998
- Come in, my parents aren't here. - Hello, Jang-mi.

38:39.243 --> 38:41.041
Wow, Jang-mi.

38:41.746 --> 38:42.713
Hey cutie!

38:43.373 --> 38:46.092
Looking good, my future bride.

38:47.210 --> 38:52.512
When are you gonna study? You don't want to go to college?

38:52.674 --> 38:54.722
Shut up and move.

38:55.718 --> 39:01.066
Su-ji! Keep being pretty like that!

39:01.057 --> 39:02.684
- When I get into a top college... - Top college?

39:02.684 --> 39:05.688
Go memorize the multiplication tables first.

39:05.687 --> 39:08.941
- Do we have noodles? - Make it yourself, you hog.

39:18.574 --> 39:22.295
- Would you like some noodles? - Without egg.

39:22.412 --> 39:25.086
Hello, Jun-ho!

39:25.164 --> 39:27.132
- Hi. - Hi!

39:27.917 --> 39:29.919
- Good to see you! - He said "good to see you!"

39:31.045 --> 39:32.137
New face?

39:32.130 --> 39:33.347
Our newest member.

39:34.549 --> 39:35.801
She's pretty.

39:42.432 --> 39:44.685
- Did you hear that? - Must be your goddamn birthday.

39:51.107 --> 39:52.529
Thank you, Jang-mi.

39:55.445 --> 39:59.291
- I'll smack you in the face. - Back atcha, girlfriend!

39:59.824 --> 40:01.622
Gimme that.

40:13.254 --> 40:14.801
Wow, it's a picture.

40:14.881 --> 40:17.179
- You forgot the eyelid. - No!

40:27.143 --> 40:28.690
This is too pretty.

40:28.686 --> 40:32.736
It's not "potatoes," "potatos."

40:32.732 --> 40:34.405
- It's "potatoes." - It's correct.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.700
- Shut up, idiot. - You hit me?

40:40.782 --> 40:44.503
One day there will be pro video game player.

40:44.952 --> 40:47.375
And portable phones.

40:47.997 --> 40:50.716
- Wouldn't they be heavy? - They'll make small ones.

40:52.835 --> 40:55.588
And portable computers!

40:56.255 --> 40:59.509
You'll write letters and watch radio shows on them.

40:59.634 --> 41:02.513
Watching radio shows?

41:02.887 --> 41:05.481
Of course. It's future.

41:06.015 --> 41:08.017
If I can make that, I'll be rich.

41:08.017 --> 41:12.523
Why, you should say that we'll have to buy water in the future.

41:12.522 --> 41:13.990
Go to your house!

41:14.232 --> 41:16.826
Why would we buy water?

41:16.818 --> 41:21.164
She said we'll have phones that'll take pictures!

41:21.155 --> 41:23.032
- It's on! - Listen, listen!

41:25.535 --> 41:28.038
- I'll remember my friends... - Granny!

41:31.332 --> 41:38.136
Chun-hwa, Su-ji, Jin-hee, Jang-mi, Bok-hee, and Na-mi.

41:39.215 --> 41:41.889
If you could make a name

41:42.552 --> 41:47.433
for our group, we will be good friends.

41:48.182 --> 41:49.559
Forever.

41:51.060 --> 41:56.567
Geum-ok, how about S-U-N-N-Y, "Sunny?"

41:57.108 --> 41:59.281
I hope you like it.

41:59.610 --> 42:02.864
Here 's a song for you girls who are having the

42:02.864 --> 42:04.707
best moments of your lives.

42:05.074 --> 42:07.418
Jo Deok-bae's "In My Dream."

42:11.664 --> 42:16.761
Yesterday I saw you in my dream

42:18.296 --> 42:23.052
I don't even know you

42:24.760 --> 42:30.017
but I can't forget you

42:31.934 --> 42:36.405
Maybe we've met somewhere

42:38.441 --> 42:43.868
Maybe I've forgotten

42:45.907 --> 42:50.788
But I've met you somewhere

42:52.872 --> 42:57.628
I've met you in the fall

42:59.128 --> 43:05.135
I'm afraid I'll wake up

43:06.093 --> 43:08.471
from this dream...

43:08.638 --> 43:09.981
Buy your own.

43:16.312 --> 43:17.814
Hi, Jang-mi.

43:20.274 --> 43:23.244
Jin-hee? The swear queen?

43:23.569 --> 43:29.827
Kids these days are so vulgar.

43:30.243 --> 43:33.668
We were different when we were young.

43:33.663 --> 43:36.166
Reading books and listening to classical music...

43:36.249 --> 43:40.504
You must have been such a cultured kid.

43:42.964 --> 43:47.970
- I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry.

43:48.219 --> 43:50.847
It's alright. Be careful.

43:51.389 --> 43:55.940
Are you Jin-hee?

43:57.270 --> 43:59.864
Na-mi? IM Na-mi?

44:02.525 --> 44:04.448
And you're Jang-mi?

44:05.027 --> 44:06.700
Of course.

44:07.238 --> 44:10.412
Sorry, my voice was too big.

44:11.659 --> 44:15.539
Na-mi, you didn't change a bit.

44:16.372 --> 44:17.965
And Jang-mi, you...

44:18.332 --> 44:19.709
didn't change either.

44:19.709 --> 44:21.427
You changed a lot.

44:21.502 --> 44:23.345
You changed your entire face except the mouth.

44:23.337 --> 44:27.387
I did not! I did my nose because of allergies.

44:30.553 --> 44:34.308
And tiny bit on the eye.

44:34.390 --> 44:36.734
Here you are, my cutie pie!

44:36.726 --> 44:39.730
Have a good time while I go for one more round.

44:41.564 --> 44:43.066
Were you good friends with my wife?

44:43.274 --> 44:46.198
Yeah, we were in the same study group.

44:46.402 --> 44:49.281
How was she in high school? Popular?

44:49.280 --> 44:54.252
Yeah, she was very... elegant.

44:55.077 --> 44:56.420
Elegant curser.

44:57.455 --> 45:00.800
Whenever there was a fight, her mouth was a weapon...

45:00.791 --> 45:05.388
Let us have girls' talk. You should go.

45:05.379 --> 45:07.222
Ok, ok. I'll see you later.

45:07.548 --> 45:08.970
Cutie muffin!

45:14.388 --> 45:17.767
Jang-mi, is there something wrong?

45:19.852 --> 45:22.321
So how are you? How old is your kid?

45:22.313 --> 45:23.940
Seventeen.

45:23.939 --> 45:26.442
You did your breasts? They're watermelons now!

45:26.442 --> 45:28.570
That's so rude.

45:30.571 --> 45:33.495
- Na-mi, what does your husban... - We were never a study group.

45:33.491 --> 45:35.118
Fuck this shit!

45:38.579 --> 45:40.331
Stop it, ok?

45:40.539 --> 45:41.631
Jin-hee.

45:41.999 --> 45:44.093
Don't you wanna meet Chun-hwa?

45:47.171 --> 45:51.972
I can't believe you found me through a detective.

45:51.967 --> 45:55.471
What's wrong with that?

45:55.763 --> 45:58.812
It feels wrong to be followed by a stranger.

45:59.141 --> 46:03.487
We had to find you fast and that was the only way.

46:03.604 --> 46:06.153
You should've found something else.

46:09.485 --> 46:11.362
Do you have their card?

46:11.862 --> 46:16.208
I can't sleep at night if they have my information.

46:18.452 --> 46:20.830
Talk to you later then.

46:22.123 --> 46:25.093
This will Work.

46:25.751 --> 46:28.880
I'll let you know when I find other two.

46:29.505 --> 46:34.557
Can you find one more person, separately?

46:34.844 --> 46:36.687
I only know his name and age.

46:36.971 --> 46:40.350
Well of course... Excuse me.

46:40.724 --> 46:46.151
Oh, you're still here?

46:46.439 --> 46:47.907
Of course I won't tell anyone.

46:48.357 --> 46:50.655
I Will kill you!

46:50.818 --> 46:55.244
Here you are! I think you wrote the plate number wrong.

46:55.239 --> 46:56.832
It's a necessity to find out if he's having an affair.

46:58.492 --> 46:59.744
What are you doing here?

47:12.965 --> 47:14.057
Hurry up.

47:15.384 --> 47:16.556
I'm going.

47:20.723 --> 47:23.101
You're not gonna tell Jang-mi, right?

47:23.684 --> 47:25.527
We'll see.

47:26.479 --> 47:31.576
- I'm doing it just in case. - Did I say anything?

47:36.739 --> 47:37.911
Who is it?

47:41.535 --> 47:46.632
We're here to spread the message from God.

47:47.124 --> 47:49.001
I already go to church.

47:49.752 --> 47:51.550
Say it nicer.

47:53.839 --> 47:57.309
God loves you a lot.

48:03.015 --> 48:04.858
Which church are you from?

48:15.861 --> 48:16.987
Please have some.

48:17.947 --> 48:22.578
It's tiny, right? We're only staying for a while.

48:22.701 --> 48:24.078
No, it's fine.

48:24.745 --> 48:27.168
- Good to see you. - I know.

48:27.873 --> 48:31.377
Na-mi, you look so young.

48:32.419 --> 48:33.887
And Jin-hee...

48:36.131 --> 48:37.724
I barely recognized you.

48:40.094 --> 48:43.644
Why are you babysitting your nephew?

48:43.639 --> 48:45.983
My sister-in-law is pregnant. So for a while...

48:45.975 --> 48:47.272
Geum-ok!

48:48.477 --> 48:49.478
Excuse me.

48:52.648 --> 48:57.996
Aren't you ashamed? Your husband and sister-in-law

48:58.153 --> 49:00.576
are doing all the hard work while you hang out with your friends.

49:01.073 --> 49:03.201
WANTED: EDUCATORS & PROFESSIONALS

49:03.576 --> 49:04.668
Sorry.

49:07.329 --> 49:09.206
- Have some coffee. - Right.

49:11.792 --> 49:13.044
Why did you close the door?!

49:13.168 --> 49:14.795
Did I say anything wrong?

49:15.796 --> 49:19.846
My god, she's locking me up!

49:20.467 --> 49:25.189
Baby's crying. Go get him.

49:28.267 --> 49:29.519
Hey guys.

49:32.688 --> 49:34.816
Can you please leave?

49:35.608 --> 49:40.608
That's not her. Not the denist's daughter we knew.

49:47.536 --> 49:52.042
All is fucking vanity in life, isn't it?

49:53.542 --> 49:55.670
Now you sound like my friend.

49:57.421 --> 50:02.052
It's all coming back to me after meeting you girls.

50:03.552 --> 50:04.474
Hey,

50:06.347 --> 50:07.564
wait!

50:13.312 --> 50:16.907
I can't find time to visit her.

50:17.608 --> 50:19.531
Can you give this to her for me?

50:20.152 --> 50:21.244
Please?

50:22.363 --> 50:24.741
Can't you stop by briefly?

50:25.282 --> 50:29.458
Perhaps if I didn't stay home...

50:30.204 --> 50:32.832
I'll give her a call, OK?

50:33.248 --> 50:36.878
And, I'll see guys again. Take care.

50:39.755 --> 50:42.759
CHUN-HWA, SORRY I COULDN'T GO SEE YOU. GEUM-OK.

50:49.056 --> 50:51.605
TO MY LOVING WIFE

51:01.026 --> 51:02.118
I'm not eating.

51:02.945 --> 51:04.447
- What happened? - Nothing.

51:04.530 --> 51:07.033
- Your face is bruised! - It's nothing.

51:07.032 --> 51:08.830
It's not nothing! What happened?

51:08.826 --> 51:10.123
I fell down!

51:12.121 --> 51:16.797
Yae-bin, what's wrong? What happened?

52:37.080 --> 52:40.300
YOUNG STAR MUSIC ROOM

52:55.265 --> 52:56.482
Come on, yeah!

53:20.582 --> 53:23.005
Middle school kids are not allowed here.

53:23.544 --> 53:25.421
I'm not in middle school.

53:27.130 --> 53:28.347
What do you want?

53:30.634 --> 53:33.308
Coffee please. Black.

53:34.930 --> 53:36.102
You pay first.

53:38.308 --> 53:39.651
1000 won.

53:45.607 --> 53:47.484
Backdoor's that way if the cops come.

54:32.029 --> 54:34.407
We saw before, right? You're Jang-mi's friend.

54:36.408 --> 54:39.457
Do you like music? Do you come here often?

54:43.665 --> 54:44.882
Do you have high pressure?

54:45.375 --> 54:49.130
- Diabetes... - Huh? What?

54:55.761 --> 54:57.513
Diabetes!

55:05.103 --> 55:06.320
Where are you going?

55:09.524 --> 55:10.696
Restroom.

55:13.570 --> 55:15.038
To wash my hands.

55:22.955 --> 55:27.677
Fuck, fuck, shit, shit!

55:29.378 --> 55:30.379
Hey!

55:31.964 --> 55:33.090
Hey.

55:50.232 --> 55:53.031
Long time no see, spirit master.

55:53.235 --> 55:54.236
Who are you?

55:54.903 --> 55:59.329
Didn't Chun-hwa tell you this is our area?

55:59.408 --> 56:01.627
- You fuckin'... - You little fuck!

56:01.910 --> 56:05.005
I know everything now! You little liar.

56:05.080 --> 56:07.583
I fucking thought it was real, bitch!

56:07.582 --> 56:08.925
Damn bitch.

56:09.209 --> 56:12.304
Heard you guys have a name now.

56:13.213 --> 56:14.089
Sunny?

56:16.133 --> 56:18.010
You sent a letter to a radio?

56:18.260 --> 56:23.437
We're gonna change our name to English, too.

56:24.266 --> 56:25.518
FINKLE.

56:26.601 --> 56:31.277
Lend us some money so we can go perm our hair.

56:31.398 --> 56:33.116
- I don't have any. - Right!

56:33.108 --> 56:35.156
Damn liar.

56:43.660 --> 56:44.912
Search her.

56:48.331 --> 56:50.459
Stop it! Stop!

56:57.257 --> 56:58.804
Hold her!

57:04.890 --> 57:07.063
Hold her legs!

57:09.478 --> 57:11.776
Stop staring!

57:13.190 --> 57:14.487
Stop staring like that!

57:15.942 --> 57:19.537
I guess you don't realize the situation.

57:19.529 --> 57:22.499
- No one will come to... - Hey!

57:22.491 --> 57:23.834
...rescue you.

57:38.006 --> 57:44.434
This is too predictable, don't you think?

57:44.596 --> 57:48.567
Come back when I'm the one in trouble.

57:48.767 --> 57:50.019
Shinchang Girl's Vocational High?

57:50.018 --> 57:53.238
Yeah. So what?

57:53.230 --> 57:56.029
You know SONG Jeong-ok?

57:57.859 --> 58:00.658
The one with a 20cm scar on her face?

58:01.029 --> 58:02.702
I did that.

58:03.824 --> 58:06.452
She still can't drink without spilling through her face.

58:07.661 --> 58:09.083
Bullshit.

58:10.580 --> 58:12.048
Give me that.

58:13.041 --> 58:14.213
I'll make yours pretty.

58:27.222 --> 58:28.895
It's time to watch Young Eleven.

58:35.355 --> 58:37.073
Wait for us!

58:39.025 --> 58:40.242
Are you ok?

58:42.529 --> 58:44.497
Why are kids so scary these days?

58:46.575 --> 58:47.872
Let's go that way.

58:55.542 --> 59:00.389
If I go to the army, I want to join the military band.

59:02.215 --> 59:03.808
Are you going to the army?

59:04.176 --> 59:06.144
Nah, I don't have to. I'm the only son for three generations.

59:07.095 --> 59:08.597
Oh, right.

59:12.684 --> 59:15.028
My name's HAN Jun-ho.

59:15.478 --> 59:17.606
I forgot to introduce my...

59:37.083 --> 59:38.460
There's a gum on your hair.

59:41.630 --> 59:44.304
I think it got on when you were being bullied.

59:46.676 --> 59:49.976
You'll need acetone to remove it.

59:52.974 --> 59:54.396
Diabetes again?

59:56.311 --> 59:57.984
I'm here.

59:58.772 --> 01:00:00.194
There's my house.

01:00:01.358 --> 01:00:02.575
Good night then.

01:00:06.529 --> 01:00:07.826
Oh and...

01:00:08.448 --> 01:00:11.167
if you meet them again, tell them I'm your boyfriend.

01:00:43.692 --> 01:00:45.820
No, you don't understand.

01:00:45.819 --> 01:00:49.323
That bitch tempted my son to...

01:00:49.531 --> 01:00:53.877
If you see your son, call us.

01:00:53.868 --> 01:00:56.747
Making a propaganda leaflet is a serious felony.

01:00:56.746 --> 01:00:59.215
Your son could go to jail.

01:01:00.542 --> 01:01:02.670
Oh Shit! What's this?!

01:01:02.752 --> 01:01:05.881
You motherfucker. Come in and eat dinner.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.099
I think it's too late for that.

01:01:08.174 --> 01:01:10.927
Mother, please go in!

01:01:10.927 --> 01:01:11.974
Do something!

01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:14.894
- If you take it you go to jail. - Give it back!

01:01:15.098 --> 01:01:17.726
- Take it then! - Mom!

01:01:17.851 --> 01:01:19.228
Take it!

01:01:19.311 --> 01:01:21.609
If you see your son call us immediately, okay?

01:01:21.855 --> 01:01:23.528
- I'm so sorry. - Let's go.

01:01:24.232 --> 01:01:26.234
It's not a joke.

01:01:26.318 --> 01:01:28.821
- Sorry, I'm so sorry. - Shit, that was scary.

01:01:28.903 --> 01:01:31.076
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:01:31.156 --> 01:01:37.914
Why did he meet this crazy girl and started labor movement?

01:01:37.996 --> 01:01:39.669
He's gonna shame us all!

01:01:39.664 --> 01:01:43.259
STEP DOWN! MURDEROUS DICTATOR!

01:01:52.302 --> 01:01:55.727
Step down, military government!

01:01:55.722 --> 01:01:58.771
It's good that school's not on. When is Su-ji coming?

01:01:59.017 --> 01:02:03.818
- She's gonna become a star. - Pretty girls...

01:02:04.272 --> 01:02:08.948
Where are those hobags?

01:02:09.361 --> 01:02:11.409
It's really ok.

01:02:11.488 --> 01:02:16.585
If they bully one of us, we pay back together.

01:02:19.412 --> 01:02:23.963
Hello everyone. I'm Miss Ryu, the mascot of peace.

01:02:23.958 --> 01:02:25.505
- Stop it, silly! - Body size 34...

01:02:25.502 --> 01:02:28.130
Shit, Shit, Shit...

01:02:28.463 --> 01:02:30.807
- Shield up! - Shield up!

01:02:32.967 --> 01:02:35.311
Step down, dictator! We want freedom!

01:02:35.428 --> 01:02:38.056
Step down, military government!

01:02:43.311 --> 01:02:46.565
Hey hobags! What a great day to...

01:03:39.451 --> 01:03:40.748
- Shitface! - Shitface! Jinx!

01:03:40.743 --> 01:03:44.919
Jinx my ass you goddamn uncreative numskull!

01:03:44.914 --> 01:03:46.211
Bloody barnacle biter!

01:03:46.207 --> 01:03:51.589
Screw your mouth from hell you pissy little nincompoop twat!

01:03:51.588 --> 01:03:54.387
Come and suck my socks, skanky snatchin' windbag!

01:03:54.382 --> 01:03:55.759
You bloody druggie hoe!

01:03:55.758 --> 01:03:57.385
Nitwit ninny noodle!

01:03:57.385 --> 01:03:58.728
- Right back atcha! - Right back and forth atcha!

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.724
- Come here you bitch! - No touching my hair!

01:04:01.723 --> 01:04:02.815
No touching!

01:04:18.823 --> 01:04:19.790
Come here!

01:04:44.766 --> 01:04:46.268
Have you seen anything like this?

01:06:28.161 --> 01:06:29.834
What ya lookin' at?

01:06:30.955 --> 01:06:32.377
At you, dummy.

01:06:34.334 --> 01:06:38.510
Let's go to the police. I've explained everything

01:06:38.504 --> 01:06:41.178
that my good son was tempted by the wrong croud.

01:06:41.174 --> 01:06:47.227
Stop it, mom! Nobody tempted me into anything.

01:06:47.221 --> 01:06:50.065
I'm coming with you, son.

01:06:54.562 --> 01:06:57.532
- Don't be ridiculous! - Jong-gi!

01:07:04.906 --> 01:07:05.998
Jong-gi?

01:07:17.543 --> 01:07:20.012
Take care of grandma while I'm gone.

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.597
And, be good. OK?

01:07:22.423 --> 01:07:23.925
Where are you going?

01:07:25.426 --> 01:07:31.183
I decided to devote my life to democracy and workers' right.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:36.901
You must never be tinged with bourgeois ideas.

01:07:39.941 --> 01:07:41.158
Take mom inside.

01:07:52.203 --> 01:08:00.054
The defendant was found guilty of deliberate failure to pay his employees,

01:08:00.169 --> 01:08:06.347
Hasan and 8 other plaintiffs, for a prolonged period of time.

01:08:06.634 --> 01:08:09.763
The court hereby orders the defendant

01:08:10.346 --> 01:08:16.524
to immediately pay the entire amount of wage arrears

01:08:16.602 --> 01:08:18.946
up to the termination of employment.

01:08:19.397 --> 01:08:20.488
Next, case...

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:25.327
number two thousand...

01:08:30.783 --> 01:08:33.081
Thank you.

01:08:34.162 --> 01:08:35.287
Jong-gi,

01:08:39.332 --> 01:08:40.505
What about mom?

01:08:41.419 --> 01:08:44.423
She's at home. I gave her a call.

01:08:47.091 --> 01:08:48.513
You okay?

01:08:51.095 --> 01:08:53.518
Not the way to live your life, is it?

01:09:04.442 --> 01:09:07.742
I'm sorry, Hasan.

01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:11.703
Go to hell.

01:09:21.751 --> 01:09:25.471
Geum-ok gave me a thousand bucks.

01:09:26.671 --> 01:09:29.801
She did what she could for a friend.

01:09:31.719 --> 01:09:33.470
You'll draw different clothes, right?

01:09:34.555 --> 01:09:38.856
Don't move. I haven't done this for a long time.

01:09:39.894 --> 01:09:41.567
Na-mi.

01:09:42.063 --> 01:09:43.029
Yep?

01:09:45.733 --> 01:09:49.613
Is there something you want to do in life?

01:09:50.822 --> 01:09:54.702
I'm too old to have dreams.

01:09:58.955 --> 01:10:00.707
Don't live without dreams.

01:10:03.835 --> 01:10:07.214
Life is too short to live without them.

01:10:09.215 --> 01:10:10.967
Told you not to move.

01:10:20.434 --> 01:10:22.061
Chun-hwa...

01:10:23.312 --> 01:10:24.814
Na-mi...

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.659
This fucking bastard is having an affair.

01:10:29.235 --> 01:10:31.158
- Who? - Fuck!

01:10:32.363 --> 01:10:34.115
What are you going to do?

01:10:36.742 --> 01:10:38.619
I'm sorry, Chun-hwa.

01:10:38.953 --> 01:10:41.581
I really didn't want to say stuff like this on our reunion.

01:10:41.581 --> 01:10:45.336
Don't worry. We're all friends.

01:10:46.252 --> 01:10:48.801
You go have an affair too!

01:10:50.423 --> 01:10:52.391
Who wants to join?

01:10:52.925 --> 01:10:55.394
Na-mi? Jang-mi?

01:10:55.469 --> 01:10:57.312
I kinda want it.

01:10:58.681 --> 01:11:01.776
But if you do it, will you still get alimony?

01:11:01.976 --> 01:11:04.229
Shit, that's right.

01:11:04.645 --> 01:11:08.445
How am I going to pay back this whistle dick?

01:11:08.608 --> 01:11:10.576
Should we go and pay back together?

01:11:11.527 --> 01:11:14.576
If they bully one of us, we pay back together, right?

01:11:14.655 --> 01:11:17.158
That's right, Na-mi!

01:11:17.241 --> 01:11:20.871
How do you want it done?

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:23.839
Like this?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.502
Or like this?!

01:11:27.627 --> 01:11:31.131
I'm not scared of anything. Tell me and I'll do it.

01:11:31.255 --> 01:11:33.257
It won't hurt like that.

01:11:33.716 --> 01:11:37.562
You have to twist it like this. Like this!

01:11:38.512 --> 01:11:41.231
Stop mutilating my hubby's dick!

01:11:41.223 --> 01:11:45.820
Korean girls always protect their husbands at the last moment.

01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:50.908
You bitches, my bitches!

01:11:51.317 --> 01:11:52.694
Your call wasn't connected...

01:11:58.074 --> 01:11:59.951
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

01:12:00.534 --> 01:12:04.710
I'll park at the back. Call me.

01:12:16.467 --> 01:12:17.559
Why do you not have it?

01:12:27.895 --> 01:12:30.239
- Are you nuts? - Fuck off!

01:12:32.316 --> 01:12:33.989
- Bring me money, ok? - Hey!

01:12:39.991 --> 01:12:41.709
Yae-bin, are you ok?

01:12:42.201 --> 01:12:45.626
Why did you do this? Come here!

01:12:45.705 --> 01:12:48.083
- The fuck... - Why are you doing this?

01:12:51.585 --> 01:12:54.259
Who are they?

01:12:54.255 --> 01:12:55.928
What do you care?

01:12:55.923 --> 01:12:57.891
What's this? Who are they?

01:12:57.883 --> 01:13:00.306
If I tell you who they are, what can you do?

01:13:00.594 --> 01:13:02.437
Kill them?

01:13:04.056 --> 01:13:05.774
Just go away.

01:13:07.059 --> 01:13:08.185
Yae-bin!

01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:17.953
Hey, insurance lady.

01:13:29.498 --> 01:13:32.468
What's a noble personage like you doing here?

01:13:32.793 --> 01:13:35.387
It's a good day to shed blood.

01:13:35.921 --> 01:13:37.468
You're dressed inappropriately

01:13:37.465 --> 01:13:40.469
Shut up! We'll do it the old way.

01:13:40.634 --> 01:13:41.476
How?

01:13:41.552 --> 01:13:43.680
I'll forstall them with my words.

01:13:44.805 --> 01:13:48.776
That's my girl!

01:13:49.643 --> 01:13:51.645
By the way, those aren't real, are they?

01:13:51.979 --> 01:13:53.981
Shut your pie hole!

01:13:56.025 --> 01:13:59.279
Anyway, where are the others?

01:14:18.547 --> 01:14:19.890
What the fuck?

01:14:20.382 --> 01:14:22.680
Thought they might recognize me.

01:14:23.719 --> 01:14:28.976
Saucy! Your husband is a lucky guy.

01:14:30.059 --> 01:14:31.106
Hello, my bitches!

01:14:35.356 --> 01:14:38.906
God, you're killing me!

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.362
Look at you!

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:45.954
You're a goddamn schoolgirl.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.579
Kinda cute, though. You can still pull it off.

01:14:49.578 --> 01:14:52.878
She said she was bored. Besides, we can't leave out the leader.

01:14:52.998 --> 01:14:53.999
Sure.

01:14:53.999 --> 01:14:55.046
She got her boobs done.

01:14:55.042 --> 01:14:57.010
- No kidding! - So what?

01:14:57.002 --> 01:15:02.224
- Let me see. - Guys, it's them!

01:15:03.259 --> 01:15:06.559
- That's them? - Stay in the back, Chun-hwa.

01:15:07.721 --> 01:15:11.897
Lose the prejudice that cancer patients can't fight.

01:15:16.397 --> 01:15:17.273
It's show time.

01:15:20.442 --> 01:15:23.696
It's a non-smoking area, bitches!

01:15:53.684 --> 01:15:56.358
- You fucking motherfucker! - Fuck!

01:15:56.437 --> 01:15:58.610
- You skanky shiznit twat! - STFU!

01:15:59.273 --> 01:16:00.775
What the hell is this bitch saying?

01:16:20.794 --> 01:16:24.469
I just came to wash the car and got called.

01:16:26.675 --> 01:16:35.026
I don't think they're crazy, but one's wearing a uniform.

01:16:37.144 --> 01:16:40.990
Maybe it's a costume play.

01:16:42.650 --> 01:16:46.621
Anyways, I'll be there soon.

01:16:55.079 --> 01:16:57.298
Designer bags are awesome.

01:16:58.666 --> 01:17:00.668
Cracks open the brain at once.

01:17:02.503 --> 01:17:03.720
Is it funny?

01:17:06.674 --> 01:17:10.395
Officer, this doesn't get covered by insurance, right?

01:17:10.386 --> 01:17:13.686
How can you expect that? This is an act of violence.

01:17:14.348 --> 01:17:18.774
Some insurance can cover injuries...

01:17:20.813 --> 01:17:22.861
Do you have insurance?

01:17:23.190 --> 01:17:27.821
How can you do your business in this situation?

01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:30.949
If I perform poorly again, I'm out this month.

01:17:31.907 --> 01:17:34.410
You should buy some. You're rich.

01:17:34.493 --> 01:17:38.214
Did you see her fly today?

01:17:38.664 --> 01:17:41.087
She's got some iron fists!

01:17:41.166 --> 01:17:44.045
Revenge and justice.

01:17:45.713 --> 01:17:48.762
Anyone else need our help?

01:17:48.841 --> 01:17:51.390
We should start a business in this.

01:17:51.677 --> 01:17:55.477
Let's make uniforms!

01:17:55.848 --> 01:17:57.691
This school uniform's actually quite comfy.

01:17:58.809 --> 01:18:00.402
Let's make flyers, too!

01:18:00.686 --> 01:18:03.906
Minimum fee, maximum satisfaction

01:18:04.106 --> 01:18:07.326
- "Sunny is back!" - Sunny!

01:18:09.445 --> 01:18:10.822
Be quiet!

01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:23.049
- Officer. - What?

01:18:23.625 --> 01:18:25.252
Can you turn up the volume?

01:18:25.252 --> 01:18:26.629
Yeah? Right.

01:19:31.485 --> 01:19:32.486
Attack!

01:19:38.784 --> 01:19:42.334
Na-mi sucks at dancing. Will she survive at the festival?

01:19:42.413 --> 01:19:45.292
Dang! I really suck my ass!

01:19:45.666 --> 01:19:48.169
Then get the fuck out.

01:19:48.544 --> 01:19:51.218
We're better off without a clown.

01:19:51.213 --> 01:19:52.339
Hey!

01:19:52.965 --> 01:19:54.387
That was bit mean.

01:19:56.176 --> 01:19:59.350
Chun-hwa, do you love her?

01:19:59.555 --> 01:20:02.183
- Are you a lesbian? - What?

01:20:02.307 --> 01:20:04.480
How do you do it with a woman?

01:20:21.869 --> 01:20:24.543
Sunny or shitty, I don't care any more.

01:20:25.038 --> 01:20:26.881
I'm out of here.

01:20:48.061 --> 01:20:48.937
What do you want?

01:20:48.937 --> 01:20:51.781
I don't understand why you hate me.

01:20:51.773 --> 01:20:54.652
But I can't let you leave us like that.

01:20:54.651 --> 01:20:56.745
- Us? - Yes, us!

01:20:56.820 --> 01:21:01.496
You've grown ballsy. When were we ever "us?"

01:21:03.076 --> 01:21:06.000
I want to know why you hate me.

01:21:05.996 --> 01:21:09.921
There's no reason. I just hate your everything.

01:21:10.042 --> 01:21:11.134
Get lost.

01:21:12.961 --> 01:21:14.508
You're not going anywhere!

01:21:15.923 --> 01:21:17.300
Get off.

01:21:22.387 --> 01:21:24.230
Are you Su-ji's friend?

01:21:24.431 --> 01:21:25.603
Good evening.

01:21:25.682 --> 01:21:28.777
Nice meetin' ya. Have ya eaten yet?

01:21:28.769 --> 01:21:29.895
Fuck off.

01:21:29.895 --> 01:21:34.275
She never brings a friend. Come eat somethin' with us.

01:21:34.274 --> 01:21:36.276
I ate somethin' already.

01:21:36.276 --> 01:21:39.120
You from Jeolla-do too?

01:21:39.112 --> 01:21:40.580
I said fuck off.

01:21:40.906 --> 01:21:44.456
Bring her in, Mommy'll make something...

01:21:44.451 --> 01:21:46.829
Who says you're my mom? You're a stepmom!

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.227
Good night!

01:22:11.603 --> 01:22:16.484
It's not fair to hate me because

01:22:17.651 --> 01:22:20.871
your stelomom's from Jeolla-do.

01:22:23.615 --> 01:22:24.912
That's against...

01:22:25.617 --> 01:22:29.588
democracy and it encourages regional...

01:22:32.791 --> 01:22:34.509
You can't even drink alcohol?

01:22:49.099 --> 01:22:54.572
It's hard for me too. My brother's a democratic activist.

01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:57.074
He might go to jail.

01:22:58.609 --> 01:23:01.283
And my granny calls me "sis".

01:23:01.278 --> 01:23:04.782
What I'm sayin' is that "us" is important.

01:23:05.032 --> 01:23:09.879
You know why "us" is important?

01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:12.714
Still... I don't like you.

01:23:14.041 --> 01:23:16.885
But I still like you.

01:23:17.544 --> 01:23:18.796
Why?

01:23:19.963 --> 01:23:21.556
Cuz you're pretty.

01:23:24.009 --> 01:23:28.936
Honestly, I was so shocked when I saw you.

01:23:29.765 --> 01:23:32.314
I was actually the prettiest in my old school.

01:23:32.809 --> 01:23:37.064
But in Seoul all the girls are pretty.

01:23:37.397 --> 01:23:42.528
But you're the prettiest.

01:23:53.497 --> 01:24:00.096
I like you. You're the prettiest girl in the world!

01:24:08.512 --> 01:24:13.814
I'm sorry that I'm so pretty. It's all my fault.

01:24:13.809 --> 01:24:18.360
What are you saying? I'm the one who's sorry.

01:24:19.147 --> 01:24:23.778
I'll stop being so pretty. You can be pretty now.

01:24:23.777 --> 01:24:27.372
I'm pretty, too. I'm sorry.

01:24:27.656 --> 01:24:32.253
I'll become a Seoul girl for you.

01:24:34.621 --> 01:24:36.840
Wait, let me drink more.

01:24:37.124 --> 01:24:39.627
One more soju please!

01:24:47.384 --> 01:24:49.227
Did Bok-hee become a Miss Korea?

01:24:50.178 --> 01:24:51.475
Let's go soon.

01:24:52.806 --> 01:24:55.104
Yeah, I miss her.

01:24:55.475 --> 01:24:58.820
No, I'm seeing Chun-hwa. I've something to give her.

01:24:59.187 --> 01:25:01.315
Should I ask if she wants to come tomorrow?

01:25:02.399 --> 01:25:04.197
Ok.

01:25:14.911 --> 01:25:16.208
Help me...

01:25:21.126 --> 01:25:24.756
Her mom took out loans to save her salon.

01:25:24.963 --> 01:25:31.312
But she couldn't pay back, so she started working at bars...

01:25:32.512 --> 01:25:35.641
...and ended up here.

01:25:36.057 --> 01:25:39.857
- What about her daughter? - She's in a facility.

01:25:42.022 --> 01:25:46.072
Poor Bok-hee...

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.864
Let's just go.

01:25:52.699 --> 01:25:54.417
I can't see this any more.

01:25:56.745 --> 01:25:58.873
Friends are for hard times.

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.302
Bok-hee.

01:26:34.199 --> 01:26:37.578
Sorry. I like coffee too much.

01:26:38.662 --> 01:26:41.757
Let's go see Chun-hwa. Shall we leave right now?

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:46.466
I can leave early. I left school early, too.

01:26:51.925 --> 01:26:57.932
If you don't bring a guy, you don't get a free time.

01:26:58.014 --> 01:27:01.644
If you have nothing else to do, go clean the toilet!

01:27:03.311 --> 01:27:06.281
Sorry. She's usually nice.

01:27:06.815 --> 01:27:09.568
I'll be back soon. Drink your coffee.

01:27:10.443 --> 01:27:12.821
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

01:27:13.113 --> 01:27:17.664
- I'm sorry. - Shut up!

01:27:17.826 --> 01:27:18.952
Hey!

01:27:23.290 --> 01:27:26.635
Give me the most expensive bottle here.

01:27:26.626 --> 01:27:27.377
Pardon me?

01:27:27.377 --> 01:27:31.757
The most expensive and overpriced one.

01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:34.138
Also bring the most expensive food here.

01:27:34.885 --> 01:27:37.809
And I'll pay for her fee. You serve today.

01:27:42.475 --> 01:27:45.445
Is one million won enough? I'll pay more if you want.

01:27:47.731 --> 01:27:48.983
Here.

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.537
Sit here.

01:27:54.779 --> 01:27:57.248
You're my hero, Na-mi!

01:27:59.534 --> 01:28:02.834
Bring real liquor, not the fake one!

01:28:02.954 --> 01:28:04.001
Alright.

01:28:07.417 --> 01:28:10.011
Bok-hee, let's find you another job.

01:28:10.086 --> 01:28:14.011
Why? I don't need to. Do you want beef jerky?

01:28:14.007 --> 01:28:17.637
I'll help you find other job.

01:28:18.261 --> 01:28:20.639
But I don't have any skills.

01:28:20.931 --> 01:28:26.062
I can do some hairdreesing. Remember my mom's hair salon?

01:28:26.519 --> 01:28:30.114
I gave you all the double eyelid tapes, right?

01:28:30.398 --> 01:28:32.992
Yes, let's do something like that.

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.364
You have a daughter. You have to live with her.

01:28:56.174 --> 01:28:59.553
I want to live with Bo-mi.

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:04.600
Without me, she can't even...

01:29:04.891 --> 01:29:08.236
...turn on the heater... - Bok-hee.

01:29:08.228 --> 01:29:11.858
We'll help you.

01:29:12.232 --> 01:29:15.236
How can you help me?

01:29:16.319 --> 01:29:18.697
And why is Chun-hwa dying?

01:29:18.697 --> 01:29:21.576
Isn't she supposed to take care of us all? Huh?

01:29:44.514 --> 01:29:45.731
Na-mi.

01:29:48.768 --> 01:29:55.947
Why are you... just looking?

01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:58.783
You weren't sleeping?

01:30:01.156 --> 01:30:02.453
Come here.

01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:14.094
- Chun-hwa. - What?

01:30:15.462 --> 01:30:16.839
Thank you.

01:30:17.547 --> 01:30:18.719
For What?

01:30:20.717 --> 01:30:26.724
For a long time, I lived as a wife and a mother of someone...

01:30:28.975 --> 01:30:34.778
and forgot how I was my own being.

01:30:36.524 --> 01:30:42.827
Now I realize that I'm the protagonist of my life.

01:30:46.159 --> 01:30:50.835
You have a face of a protagonist.

01:30:57.337 --> 01:31:01.808
Su-ji also had a face of a protagonist...

01:31:05.345 --> 01:31:07.018
I'll find her for you.

01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:26.867
What's this?

01:31:33.081 --> 01:31:35.049
SUNNY

01:31:45.135 --> 01:31:47.183
HUSBAND

01:31:48.596 --> 01:31:52.021
Na-mi! Hold it straight.

01:31:52.725 --> 01:31:54.773
Chun-hwa

01:31:55.478 --> 01:31:59.278
you've done a great job in a man 's world.

01:31:59.566 --> 01:32:02.069
I can't believe you're still taking care of these guys!

01:32:02.610 --> 01:32:05.113
I think you're the best.

01:32:06.072 --> 01:32:10.919
Jang-mi, I think you'll be the best plastic surgery patient.

01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:13.083
You'll turn so beautiful after the double eyelid surgery.

01:32:14.247 --> 01:32:19.094
Jin - hee! I know you'll make a swearword dictionary and

01:32:19.169 --> 01:32:21.467
with a man you fall in love... Fuck!

01:32:21.588 --> 01:32:23.386
You're gonna do what with a man...?

01:32:26.426 --> 01:32:27.598
I wanna do it foo!

01:32:28.386 --> 01:32:35.270
Hello Geum-ok! I know you'll become a very famous writer.

01:32:35.268 --> 01:32:38.021
I also read your book and it was awesome...

01:32:49.115 --> 01:32:49.991
Bok-hee!

01:32:50.116 --> 01:32:55.088
Hi, Bok-hee. I believe you're a Miss Korea by now.

01:32:56.289 --> 01:33:00.465
And you probably have a loving husband and children.

01:33:00.627 --> 01:33:02.880
That's so awesome!

01:33:03.796 --> 01:33:09.303
Bok-hee, you'll be loved by everyone.

01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:12.059
I love you so much!

01:33:17.018 --> 01:33:21.194
- Su-ji! - Our magazine model!

01:33:21.314 --> 01:33:24.409
- Show us some pose! - Yeah, show us!

01:33:24.651 --> 01:33:30.658
- Show us! - Show us!

01:33:35.286 --> 01:33:38.460
It's your turn, Na-mi.

01:33:48.258 --> 01:33:50.681
Hello, Na-mi of the future.

01:33:50.843 --> 01:33:54.768
I'm the high school Na-mi.

01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:59.361
I think you'd be an artist by now.

01:33:59.352 --> 01:34:04.279
And once you're in college you'd be a DJ.

01:34:04.357 --> 01:34:08.407
And I also want to become an owner of a comic bookstore.

01:34:08.403 --> 01:34:10.872
I won't charge late fee. Also...

01:34:10.863 --> 01:34:16.370
I think you really look like Sophie Marceau.

01:34:19.038 --> 01:34:20.039
What?

01:34:21.165 --> 01:34:26.262
I'll be in movies like La Boum.

01:34:26.254 --> 01:34:27.927
And I also wanna become a dancer...

01:34:27.922 --> 01:34:29.765
You can't even dance!

01:34:32.302 --> 01:34:34.555
Chun-hwa, come here!

01:35:00.663 --> 01:35:02.210
Where're you going?

01:35:02.415 --> 01:35:03.382
To drink water!

01:35:03.374 --> 01:35:05.297
Buy me a salad bun!

01:35:06.210 --> 01:35:07.302
No money!

01:35:16.095 --> 01:35:17.688
Hey, farm girl!

01:35:24.604 --> 01:35:28.905
You drink water like a true farm girl.

01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:31.235
What do you want?

01:35:31.235 --> 01:35:33.454
I have something to ask.

01:35:35.198 --> 01:35:36.791
I heard that in the countryside...

01:35:36.783 --> 01:35:39.957
...people group fuck behind hay stacks.

01:35:40.119 --> 01:35:41.871
- Have you done that? - LEE Sang-mi!

01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:45.463
Shut the fuck up!

01:35:48.961 --> 01:35:50.679
Wow, I'm impressed.

01:35:51.464 --> 01:35:58.439
Don't expect Chun-hwa and her pals to stick around forever.

01:35:58.679 --> 01:36:02.650
- They'll dump you as soon as... - Stop fucking with me!

01:36:08.815 --> 01:36:11.284
I'm letting you go this once.

01:36:12.485 --> 01:36:13.702
Be careful!

01:36:37.009 --> 01:36:38.636
MEET ME AT THE GARBAGE DUMP.

01:36:40.346 --> 01:36:42.144
Hey, farm girl!

01:36:57.363 --> 01:36:59.036
You didn't say I have to come alone.

01:36:59.407 --> 01:37:00.533
Say sorry.

01:37:00.533 --> 01:37:01.409
What?

01:37:01.617 --> 01:37:05.372
If you say sorry, I'll forgive everything.

01:37:06.414 --> 01:37:07.836
I won't.

01:37:08.291 --> 01:37:11.340
I'll say it first, then. I'm sorry I used swearwords.

01:37:12.378 --> 01:37:15.507
I heard you were friends with Chun-hwa but you had a fight

01:37:15.506 --> 01:37:17.383
because Chun-hwa didn't like you sniffing glue...

01:37:20.887 --> 01:37:23.140
I can't listen to this bullshit any more.

01:37:23.431 --> 01:37:28.232
You guys call yourself what? Sunny?

01:37:29.103 --> 01:37:31.731
You guys don't realize this is the end of yours.

01:37:31.898 --> 01:37:35.243
I'm going to kill all of you, one by one...

01:37:36.402 --> 01:37:37.904
...starting from today.

01:37:41.741 --> 01:37:42.867
Give me the camera.

01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:44.957
Take them off.

01:37:52.043 --> 01:37:53.716
What a fucking mess.

01:38:24.951 --> 01:38:28.205
Say that again. You're gonna do what?

01:38:28.287 --> 01:38:30.415
Fucking bitch!

01:38:31.415 --> 01:38:33.463
Do you want your pretty face to get ruined?

01:38:33.751 --> 01:38:34.877
I'll scratch your...

01:38:46.556 --> 01:38:50.527
You'll have to take her to the hospital.

01:38:54.772 --> 01:38:57.150
Don't do it, Su-ji!

01:38:57.984 --> 01:38:59.452
Don't do it!

01:39:08.578 --> 01:39:09.830
If I were you

01:39:10.204 --> 01:39:12.502
I'd be too shamed to come to school.

01:39:26.679 --> 01:39:28.852
We're going on a travel with my bro's friends.

01:39:28.848 --> 01:39:32.569
Two days. You should join.

01:39:32.643 --> 01:39:34.896
Jun-ho is coming too!

01:39:39.734 --> 01:39:40.860
What happened?

01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:44.034
Gosh, what's wrong?

01:39:44.113 --> 01:39:45.114
Did you fight?

01:39:45.448 --> 01:39:47.871
- I fell down. - You did not!

01:39:47.867 --> 01:39:48.868
It's quite serious.

01:39:52.872 --> 01:39:55.716
Who the fuck smokes in school?

01:39:57.293 --> 01:39:58.840
And American cigarette?

01:39:59.295 --> 01:40:04.267
Didn't I tell you I'll rip you off if I find you smoking?

01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:13.394
Put everything in your bag and pocket on the desk.

01:40:13.601 --> 01:40:14.602
Now!

01:40:28.366 --> 01:40:29.868
Are you crazy?

01:40:31.661 --> 01:40:32.787
Get up.

01:40:33.579 --> 01:40:34.626
Get up.

01:40:36.916 --> 01:40:40.671
Get up. Get up!

01:40:41.712 --> 01:40:45.933
You're not getting up? Huh? Get up!

01:40:45.925 --> 01:40:47.598
Get the fuck up!

01:40:49.845 --> 01:40:54.442
Ok. You're a dead meat.

01:40:55.768 --> 01:40:58.567
You're making me real angry.

01:40:58.646 --> 01:41:01.775
I'll show you how a Marine beats bitches like you.

01:41:01.941 --> 01:41:06.117
Go back to the army and fuck yourself, motherfucker!

01:41:31.637 --> 01:41:35.813
We still can't find JUNG Su-ji.

01:41:36.684 --> 01:41:43.818
This isn't the best solution, but we could publish an obituary.

01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:47.653
But of course, we'll try again.

01:41:51.991 --> 01:41:54.995
And the person you asked me to find separately...

01:41:55.619 --> 01:41:58.338
HAN JUN-HO

01:42:25.524 --> 01:42:26.867
Don't hit her without me!

01:42:29.695 --> 01:42:30.867
Wassup?

01:42:31.447 --> 01:42:33.040
Nothing.

01:42:33.532 --> 01:42:34.875
Come and play with us.

01:43:23.374 --> 01:43:24.591
Come on in!

01:43:32.758 --> 01:43:34.305
- Coffee, please. - Sure.

01:43:46.438 --> 01:43:48.816
Dad! You're late.

01:44:23.642 --> 01:44:25.360
You haven't been here for a long time.

01:44:30.691 --> 01:44:31.738
No?

01:44:34.486 --> 01:44:36.238
It's been a while.

01:45:33.879 --> 01:45:35.256
I can finally give this to you.

01:47:47.513 --> 01:47:50.813
JINDEOK SCHOOL FESTIVAL

01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:53.569
I LOVE SU-JI

01:47:53.769 --> 01:47:55.487
SU-JI IS MY LIFE

01:47:59.191 --> 01:48:01.614
The power of mass media!

01:48:01.693 --> 01:48:05.539
After Su-ji got on the magazine, her fans have tripled!

01:48:05.989 --> 01:48:08.708
What if she becomes a real movie star?

01:48:10.410 --> 01:48:11.957
Not a big deal.

01:48:12.871 --> 01:48:15.966
If you become a movie star, let's do the eyelid surgery together!

01:48:15.958 --> 01:48:17.926
I was gonna do that for you!

01:48:23.757 --> 01:48:25.054
Why are you acting weird?

01:48:25.884 --> 01:48:27.056
Nothing.

01:48:28.637 --> 01:48:31.186
Go get something to eat. We have enough time.

01:48:54.371 --> 01:48:55.873
Na-mi!

01:49:07.593 --> 01:49:09.345
I thought of you a lot.

01:49:10.762 --> 01:49:12.059
I'm sorry.

01:49:15.434 --> 01:49:20.611
I should have been nicer to a new kid.

01:49:23.066 --> 01:49:24.318
Forgive me.

01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:27.739
No, I'm sorry.

01:49:27.738 --> 01:49:28.864
Really?

01:49:30.282 --> 01:49:33.912
Then let's eat together to celebrate our friendship.

01:49:36.538 --> 01:49:38.461
You smell like glue.

01:49:42.377 --> 01:49:43.754
I smell?

01:49:44.588 --> 01:49:45.635
Do I smell?!

01:49:45.631 --> 01:49:46.803
No.

01:49:48.175 --> 01:49:50.974
- You smell like glue... - For fuck's sake!

01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:57.393
Of course I smell!

01:50:01.563 --> 01:50:05.238
You drink "Sunny 10", so you smell like Sunny.

01:50:14.243 --> 01:50:15.460
You want some?

01:50:19.122 --> 01:50:22.251
You should try it. Come on.

01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:24.007
Come on.

01:50:27.839 --> 01:50:29.182
Go on, drink.

01:50:30.759 --> 01:50:31.601
Go on!

01:50:37.724 --> 01:50:43.197
Next is our proud drum and fife band,

01:50:43.397 --> 01:50:46.867
who came back from the successful Africa tour!

01:50:57.286 --> 01:50:58.458
Ooh, sexy

01:51:01.039 --> 01:51:02.131
Chun-hwa.

01:51:14.219 --> 01:51:15.766
I'm buying you this.

01:51:16.096 --> 01:51:18.394
You gotta drink something.

01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:19.766
That's ok.

01:51:19.850 --> 01:51:21.898
Why? You think I'm dirty?

01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:25.569
Drink it for our friendship!

01:51:32.321 --> 01:51:36.997
I'm Sunny from now on. Sunny smell, Sunny...

01:51:39.286 --> 01:51:44.167
I told you I'll kill you if you come sniffin' glue!

01:51:47.836 --> 01:51:48.962
Get her up.

01:52:16.573 --> 01:52:18.291
Why am I not allowed?

01:52:19.951 --> 01:52:22.795
What's so special about her?

01:52:28.668 --> 01:52:30.341
Hey, pretty face.

01:53:09.209 --> 01:53:11.337
- Su-ji! - Su-ji!

01:53:37.237 --> 01:53:39.456
Get out of here!

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:55.847
Su-ji...

01:53:58.049 --> 01:53:59.266
You're all expelled.

01:54:02.888 --> 01:54:05.562
Fantastic job in front of the inspector!

01:54:06.433 --> 01:54:09.061
Where is the other one? Hey, you!

01:54:09.394 --> 01:54:12.648
Come here, little piece of shit!

01:54:15.901 --> 01:54:17.949
Come here!

01:54:18.737 --> 01:54:23.334
Is that how you were taught in your old school?

01:54:27.412 --> 01:54:31.258
I sold everything to move here. For your education!

01:54:31.249 --> 01:54:33.547
Don't hit her!

01:54:33.543 --> 01:54:38.174
One goes of jail, the other gets suspended!

01:54:38.423 --> 01:54:42.178
Get the fuck out of my house. All of you!

01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:45.514
Why did you hang out...

01:54:45.514 --> 01:54:49.269
...with bad girls? - Please don't hit her, papa.

01:54:49.476 --> 01:54:50.602
Father.

01:54:57.359 --> 01:55:00.158
I sold out my comrades to save my skin.

01:55:01.613 --> 01:55:03.331
I'm a goddamn dog.

01:55:07.035 --> 01:55:09.413
I'll live like a dog from now.

01:55:09.538 --> 01:55:13.509
Oh, my baby. My son!

01:55:13.792 --> 01:55:15.669
My boy!

01:56:00.171 --> 01:56:01.468
How is she?

01:56:03.258 --> 01:56:05.010
She tried to kill herself.

01:56:15.061 --> 01:56:17.814
It's ok. She's not dead.

01:56:19.232 --> 01:56:20.028
It's ok.

01:56:20.025 --> 01:56:23.120
We're not going to see each other again?

01:56:24.529 --> 01:56:25.701
IM Na-mi!

01:56:26.489 --> 01:56:31.916
Getting expelled from school isn't the end of Sunny.

01:56:34.914 --> 01:56:38.589
We'll meet again, bring Su-ji with us

01:56:39.878 --> 01:56:41.880
and dance what we couldn't dance today.

01:56:43.548 --> 01:56:44.765
Understand?

01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:48.762
Do you understand?

01:56:52.932 --> 01:56:56.106
We'll meet again.

01:56:58.355 --> 01:57:00.528
If you ignore us because your life is too good,

01:57:00.857 --> 01:57:02.325
we'll go and punish you.

01:57:03.401 --> 01:57:05.403
If you hide because your life sucks,

01:57:06.237 --> 01:57:08.490
we'll go and make it better.

01:57:10.492 --> 01:57:13.462
I don't know who will die first among us,

01:57:15.413 --> 01:57:16.915
but until that day...

01:57:18.333 --> 01:57:22.759
No, even beyond that day... We, Sunny, will never break up.

01:58:13.304 --> 01:58:15.853
- Why did you come? - I missed you.

01:58:17.976 --> 01:58:19.228
Everything okay?

01:58:22.105 --> 01:58:23.482
Yeah, everything's ok.

01:58:29.195 --> 01:58:33.450
Downtown is usually the best route...

01:58:34.659 --> 01:58:36.457
- Mr. Bong? - Yes?

01:58:37.704 --> 01:58:39.877
Downtown is never the best route.

01:58:41.541 --> 01:58:42.542
Ok...

01:58:45.336 --> 01:58:46.462
What?

01:58:48.506 --> 01:58:49.632
What?

01:59:21.372 --> 01:59:22.373
Mom!

01:59:23.208 --> 01:59:24.209
Your phone.

01:59:29.589 --> 01:59:31.136
Jang-mi?

01:59:55.698 --> 01:59:59.953
This is the problem of dying single. No family.

02:00:00.328 --> 02:00:03.252
Is that why you won't get a divorce?

02:00:04.332 --> 02:00:07.802
He gave me a building.

02:00:08.169 --> 02:00:10.217
Also he said he won't again.

02:00:10.588 --> 02:00:13.011
Did you have an affair too?

02:00:14.926 --> 02:00:15.927
You did?

02:00:16.761 --> 02:00:17.933
You did!

02:00:18.429 --> 02:00:20.932
You said we should do it together!

02:00:21.432 --> 02:00:23.275
Who said I did?

02:00:23.685 --> 02:00:27.235
And you said you'd think about it, you indecisive bitch.

02:00:27.981 --> 02:00:30.609
Stop swearing in the funeral.

02:00:31.651 --> 02:00:32.948
Crazy bitches.

02:00:36.114 --> 02:00:37.286
Na-mi.

02:00:40.285 --> 02:00:41.457
Geum-ok?

02:00:42.579 --> 02:00:44.547
How did you make it?

02:00:44.831 --> 02:00:47.584
I don't care any more.

02:00:47.667 --> 02:00:49.544
You go girl!

02:00:49.627 --> 02:00:53.382
Geum-ok the dentist's girl!

02:00:53.631 --> 02:00:55.304
Long time no see!

02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:57.974
- How have you been? - Good.

02:00:57.969 --> 02:00:59.516
You haven't changed a bit.

02:00:59.512 --> 02:01:00.764
- Really? - Yeah.

02:01:00.930 --> 02:01:02.307
It's so nice to see you!

02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:04.859
Wait a sec, I want to say hi to Chun-hwa.

02:01:04.851 --> 02:01:08.151
You can wait. We'll do it together when everybody comes.

02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:12.700
Who else is coming? Su-ji? Is she ok?

02:01:12.984 --> 02:01:15.407
What about Bok-hee? Did she become a Miss Korea?

02:01:15.486 --> 02:01:17.784
The prize money was too small.

02:01:19.616 --> 02:01:21.960
It's good to see you guys!

02:01:28.291 --> 02:01:31.465
How come nobody's here?

02:01:31.461 --> 02:01:33.179
The actual funeral was yesterday.

02:01:33.171 --> 02:01:35.390
Today she just wanted us.

02:01:35.381 --> 02:01:38.726
Chun-hwa's always special. Let's wait for Su-ji together.

02:01:38.718 --> 02:01:41.346
Su-ji is coming? Is her face ok?

02:01:41.471 --> 02:01:46.193
We didn't actually find her, but we did put an ad.

02:01:46.184 --> 02:01:48.152
SU-JI, PLEASE ATTEND CHUN-HWA'S LAST CONCERT!

02:01:48.144 --> 02:01:49.737
Let's sit down and talk.

02:01:49.979 --> 02:01:53.028
Let's wait till 12. Everybody ok with that?

02:01:53.024 --> 02:01:54.116
Geum-ok?

02:01:54.359 --> 02:01:58.865
I'm fine. Not going back there tonight.

02:01:59.197 --> 02:02:01.575
Bok-hee, what do you do?

02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:07.331
This and that... I'm looking for a new job.

02:02:07.747 --> 02:02:11.172
You're so lucky. Every women should have a job.

02:02:11.167 --> 02:02:13.716
I'm tired of being ignored by my husband and his family.

02:02:13.711 --> 02:02:16.464
I don't think it's a bad thing to have a husband.

02:02:16.547 --> 02:02:19.471
- What? Do they bully you? - Uh-huh.

02:02:19.467 --> 02:02:21.185
- Should we punish them? - Yeah!

02:02:21.386 --> 02:02:25.016
Didn't I tell you about when we beat up Na-mi's daughter's bully?

02:02:25.014 --> 02:02:27.563
- No, never! - Tell me, tell me!

02:02:27.725 --> 02:02:30.854
It's a bit complicated...

02:02:32.605 --> 02:02:34.573
I guess Su-ji can't make it.

02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:37.823
- Should we greet now? - Alright.

02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:48.037
Did you come for HA Chun-hwa's funeral?

02:02:48.496 --> 02:02:50.498
I'm the lawyer of Mrs. HA.

02:02:52.041 --> 02:02:53.793
Are you the members of "Sunny?"

02:02:58.339 --> 02:03:02.970
I'm here to execute the will of Mrs. HA.

02:03:04.095 --> 02:03:08.771
She especially ordered me to read it realistically.

02:03:09.434 --> 02:03:14.110
So please bear with me.

02:03:15.648 --> 02:03:16.945
Hey bitches!

02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:24.533
I just read it like...

02:03:25.074 --> 02:03:26.621
Sorry, I'll read it again.

02:03:26.784 --> 02:03:29.037
Hey b... b... I'll skip that.

02:03:30.705 --> 02:03:32.002
Is everyone here?

02:03:33.291 --> 02:03:35.714
If you didn't make it, I understand.

02:03:36.335 --> 02:03:40.761
I'm sorry we didn't keep the promise we made

02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:43.934
in front of Su-ji's house 25 years ago.

02:03:44.635 --> 02:03:49.607
I know I'm a bad leader for dying so early.

02:03:51.142 --> 02:03:55.272
Na-mi, thanks for finding our friends.

02:03:56.397 --> 02:03:58.320
My life wasn't long, but...

02:03:58.483 --> 02:04:04.365
as you've said, I was the protagonist of my life.

02:04:05.114 --> 02:04:07.663
Thank you for that.

02:04:08.534 --> 02:04:12.960
Na-mi will be the next leader of Sunny.

02:04:13.831 --> 02:04:19.554
Please enjoy the life together for me,

02:04:20.046 --> 02:04:21.138
all of you.

02:04:21.798 --> 02:04:22.845
Take care.

02:04:26.844 --> 02:04:28.096
Congrats, Na-mi.

02:04:34.268 --> 02:04:35.315
Thanks.

02:04:37.230 --> 02:04:43.237
Mrs. HA left presents for all of you.

02:04:45.154 --> 02:04:46.406
KIM Jang-mi.

02:04:47.532 --> 02:04:48.454
Yes?

02:04:49.283 --> 02:04:51.536
Are you an insurance agent?

02:04:51.536 --> 02:04:52.412
Yes.

02:04:52.787 --> 02:05:00.387
Everyone here is going to buy every insurance you sell.

02:05:00.670 --> 02:05:06.723
All the fees will be paid in full.

02:05:08.886 --> 02:05:09.978
I'm so happy for you!

02:05:10.054 --> 02:05:11.397
How...?

02:05:12.098 --> 02:05:15.352
She left a large sum of money behind.

02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:21.317
She donated the rest to charity and...

02:05:28.990 --> 02:05:31.493
You're the insurance queen of the month, bitch!

02:05:32.577 --> 02:05:37.174
I've never been a queen before!

02:05:38.541 --> 02:05:39.758
HWANG Jin-hee.

02:05:40.293 --> 02:05:41.419
Yes?

02:05:42.086 --> 02:05:43.759
You can be the vice-leader.

02:05:44.589 --> 02:05:45.932
That's it.

02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:49.644
But I was always the vice-leader.

02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:52.434
Don't lie. The vice-leader was me.

02:05:52.763 --> 02:05:54.982
What are you talking about?

02:05:55.057 --> 02:05:57.606
Su-ji and I were always the vice-leader.

02:05:57.602 --> 02:05:58.819
Are you disappointed?

02:06:00.563 --> 02:06:02.236
Not exactly...

02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:05.819
She told me to read here if you're disappointed.

02:06:06.652 --> 02:06:08.279
I'm not.

02:06:10.364 --> 02:06:11.240
What does it say?

02:06:11.240 --> 02:06:13.242
Bitch! You're rich!

02:06:15.453 --> 02:06:16.921
You are rich!

02:06:16.913 --> 02:06:19.257
- You even have a building! - Okay, okay.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.843
- SEO Geum-ok. - Yes?

02:06:23.711 --> 02:06:25.839
You majored in Korean Literature?

02:06:25.838 --> 02:06:27.090
Yes I did.

02:06:28.549 --> 02:06:31.348
There's a small publishing company under Mrs. HA.

02:06:31.636 --> 02:06:33.309
You'll start there as an intern,

02:06:33.387 --> 02:06:35.060
hired after six months,

02:06:35.139 --> 02:06:40.145
and if you maintain the 150% sales rate for two years,

02:06:40.436 --> 02:06:42.609
you'll be hired as the executive manager.

02:06:43.606 --> 02:06:44.698
Really?

02:06:44.982 --> 02:06:48.077
- Good for you! - Congrats!

02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:49.946
She also left these words.

02:06:51.405 --> 02:06:53.658
I'll kill you if you screw up.

02:06:55.993 --> 02:06:57.961
That's so Chun-hwa!

02:07:03.918 --> 02:07:05.170
RYU Bok-hee.

02:07:06.754 --> 02:07:07.846
Yes.

02:07:09.715 --> 02:07:12.685
She left you an apartment to live with your daughter.

02:07:14.929 --> 02:07:19.184
All the living expenses, tuition, and marriage expenses

02:07:19.475 --> 02:07:22.024
will be provided by the company fund.

02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:25.740
She also booked a hospital for your rehab.

02:07:25.731 --> 02:07:28.860
When you get better, you'll go through a vocational training

02:07:28.943 --> 02:07:32.664
and open up your own business on the 1st floor

02:07:34.699 --> 02:07:36.292
of Geum-ok's company.

02:07:38.869 --> 02:07:40.291
Thank you!

02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:43.082
- Thank you! - Bok-hee...

02:07:51.841 --> 02:07:53.309
There's one thing you need to do.

02:07:54.760 --> 02:07:59.391
Did all of you receive registered mail?

02:08:00.891 --> 02:08:02.313
The dance video.

02:08:03.436 --> 02:08:05.780
This is Chun-hwa's last wish. Let's make it awesome.

02:08:05.771 --> 02:08:06.818
Did you practice?

02:08:06.814 --> 02:08:08.566
I tried few times for diet.

02:08:08.566 --> 02:08:10.614
Are we allowed to do this in a funeral?

02:08:10.609 --> 02:08:12.282
The leader wants it.

02:08:12.361 --> 02:08:14.534
If someone complains, I'll take the responsibility.

02:08:14.613 --> 02:08:16.741
You the leader!

02:08:16.949 --> 02:08:18.917
The vice-leader's got your back!

02:08:19.285 --> 02:08:21.208
Ok. Let's do this!

02:11:13.130 --> 02:15:25.130
