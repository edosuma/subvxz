00:06.006 --> 00:07.090
[thunder rumbling]

00:22.772 --> 00:25.984
[Billy]  I'm sorry,
I did not quite catch your name.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.361
[distorted screaming]

00:28.862 --> 00:29.696
[Max]  What happened?

00:30.572 --> 00:31.531
Help me.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.575
[screaming] No!

00:35.910 --> 00:37.120
[thunderclap]

00:37.203 --> 00:38.204
Which one?

00:38.955 --> 00:39.914
I don't know.

00:43.626 --> 00:47.088
Hey, there's nothing to worry about
anymore, okay?

00:49.466 --> 00:51.051
It doesn't make sense.

00:51.801 --> 00:52.969
What doesn't make sense?

00:54.512 --> 00:55.430
Heather.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.433
The blood.

00:59.476 --> 01:00.310
The ice.

01:00.393 --> 01:04.355
Heather had a fever, so she took
a cold bath, but she's better now.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.357
That has to be it.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.318
I don't know where that blood
came from, but...

01:08.860 --> 01:09.986
we saw her.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.947
We both saw her. She's totally fine.

01:15.075 --> 01:15.992
What about Billy?

01:17.368 --> 01:18.286
What about him?

01:19.829 --> 01:21.915
He seemed wrong.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.542
[chuckles] Wrong is kind of like
his default.

01:24.709 --> 01:28.296
But it's nice to know he's not a murderer,
because that would've totally sucked.

01:28.379 --> 01:29.547
[chuckles]

01:34.761 --> 01:36.763
Who... is that?

01:37.889 --> 01:41.142
See, this is why you can't just
hang out with Mike all the time.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.477
This is Wonder Woman.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.145
AKA Princess Diana.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.482
She's from Paradise Island,
which is, like, this hidden island

01:47.565 --> 01:49.651
where there are only
women Amazon warriors.

01:50.151 --> 01:52.153
[thunder rumbling]

01:53.655 --> 01:57.033
[Mrs. Driscoll screaming]
Let me go! Let me go!

01:57.117 --> 01:59.410
Doris, we need you to stay calm for us,
okay?

01:59.494 --> 02:01.287
-Stay calm.
-I have to go back!

02:01.371 --> 02:04.165
I have to go back!

02:04.833 --> 02:06.459
I have to go back!

02:06.543 --> 02:08.586
I have to go back!

02:10.672 --> 02:11.923
Okay, so,

02:12.298 --> 02:15.552
you two want to explain to me
what in the name of Jesus

02:15.635 --> 02:16.886
just happened here?

02:17.345 --> 02:18.555
[ambulance doors closing]

02:18.638 --> 02:19.764
[siren wailing]

02:22.976 --> 02:24.519

[panting]

02:42.328 --> 02:44.247
[straining]

02:45.373 --> 02:46.291
[muffled] Tom!

02:46.583 --> 02:48.459

02:48.543 --> 02:49.586
[Tom sobs]

02:49.669 --> 02:51.796

-[gasps]

02:53.673 --> 02:55.175
[Tom whimpers]

02:55.842 --> 02:56.926
Hi, Daddy.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.308
Heather...

03:04.851 --> 03:05.810
sweetie...

03:07.145 --> 03:09.397
whatever this is,
whatever he's got you into,

03:09.981 --> 03:11.357
you don't have to do this.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.069
You can stop this.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.739
There is no stopping it, Daddy.

03:17.822 --> 03:18.823
[gasps]

03:19.657 --> 03:20.658
You'll see.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.660
[Janet sobbing]

03:22.744 --> 03:23.578
No.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.542
[whimpering]

03:29.626 --> 03:31.085
[sobbing]

03:31.794 --> 03:33.046
[whimpering]

03:33.129 --> 03:35.006
Heather, please! Heather!

03:36.799 --> 03:38.218
Try not to move.

03:41.679 --> 03:42.513
No.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.473
No.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.600
-[gasps]
-[grunts]

03:45.683 --> 03:47.143
Heather!

03:47.227 --> 03:48.144
Heather!

03:48.978 --> 03:51.231
[creature snarling]

03:52.899 --> 03:54.442
[roaring]

03:55.235 --> 03:56.361
Jesus Christ.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.988

03:59.781 --> 04:02.158
[snarling and roaring]

04:02.242 --> 04:03.243
[Tom wails]

04:05.203 --> 04:06.079
[Tom] No.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.206
[snarling]

04:08.289 --> 04:09.123
[Tom] No--

04:09.707 --> 04:11.709
[screaming]

04:16.589 --> 04:18.758
[muffled grunts]

04:18.841 --> 04:20.593

[birdsong]

05:30.621 --> 05:31.706
[groans]

05:36.294 --> 05:37.503
[coughs]

05:37.670 --> 05:39.255
[Joyce] Hey, careful.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.382
-[voice echoing] Careful.
-[Hopper coughs]

05:42.050 --> 05:43.092
Here.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.470
Hey.

05:46.971 --> 05:47.805
Joyce.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.266
[Hopper sighs]

05:51.726 --> 05:52.560
[retching]

05:52.643 --> 05:53.644
Oh.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.564
Here, here, here.

05:56.647 --> 05:57.857
[coughing, vomiting]

05:57.940 --> 05:58.941
It's okay.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.193
[loud vomiting]

06:00.276 --> 06:02.570
That's it. Got it?

06:02.653 --> 06:03.905
[groans]

06:06.074 --> 06:08.201
-Here.
-How long have I been out?

06:08.284 --> 06:09.202
A while.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.245
You've been drifting in and out.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.247
Yeah, but how did I get here?

06:13.331 --> 06:14.290
Slowly.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.960
-What's the last thing you remember?
-Some thug attacked me.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.046
-Hey, you need to rest.
-No, I'm fine.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.131
-No, you're not fine, Hop--
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.341
[exclaims]

06:23.424 --> 06:24.550
Um...

06:24.634 --> 06:26.219
-Where are my clothes?
-Uh...

06:26.886 --> 06:27.970
Uh...

06:34.352 --> 06:35.395
[sharp exhale]

06:36.145 --> 06:37.647
They were soaked.

06:39.607 --> 06:41.692
I mean, did you recognize him?

06:41.776 --> 06:43.152
-Who?
-The thug.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.154
[Hopper] Well, I didn't get a good look.

06:45.446 --> 06:48.157
Well, I mean,
he's gotta be government, right?

06:48.616 --> 06:51.911
Yeah, but if he's government,
what's he doing slinking around?

06:51.994 --> 06:53.621
W-Why is he running?

06:53.704 --> 06:55.581
You know,
why didn't we find anything down there?

06:55.665 --> 06:56.791
Let's ask him.

06:58.376 --> 06:59.377
What is that?

06:59.460 --> 07:00.878
His license plate.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.798
-What are the dashes?
-Well, they're blanks.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.426
There was...
I think it was either an H or a P

07:06.509 --> 07:08.052
with the part rubbed off.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.138
And there was definitely a Y.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.389
For sure.

07:11.472 --> 07:14.600
And that, I think, was a B,
but it could've been an eight.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.726
And that-- Wait--

07:15.810 --> 07:17.562
I think you should stick to sales.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.898
Can't you run a search or something?

07:21.482 --> 07:24.318
I just think you have to lower
your expectations.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.988
I mean, this is a state government agency.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.739
Gonna take weeks
before they find a match.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.741
-Weeks?
-If we're lucky.

07:30.825 --> 07:31.659
And, I mean,

07:31.742 --> 07:33.953
what are the odds that this guy

07:34.036 --> 07:36.289
registers a car in his own name?

07:36.372 --> 07:37.665
It wasn't a car.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.501
[clears throat] Uh, what are you wearing?

07:40.585 --> 07:42.670
What do you mean it wasn't a car?

07:44.964 --> 07:46.215
[Lucas over radio]  Do you copy?

07:46.757 --> 07:48.676
This is a code red.

07:48.759 --> 07:49.760
[radio static pops]

07:49.844 --> 07:52.805
I repeat, this is a code red.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.892
Max. Do you copy?

07:56.184 --> 07:58.603
-This is a code red.
-[Max scoffs]

07:58.686 --> 07:59.562
Shut...

07:59.645 --> 08:00.480
up.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.695
She turned it off.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.616
[phone ringing]

08:11.699 --> 08:14.243
[scoffs] You've got to be kidding me.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.873
I'm sleeping. Go away.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.791
[Mike]  This is Mike. Do not hang up.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.627
Something happened, something bad.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.837
Our very lives can be at stake.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.215
-What are you talking about?
-Just come over to my house.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.633
We'll explain everything.

08:28.716 --> 08:29.842
-[Max]  What?
-Hurry.

08:30.843 --> 08:31.844
[click, dial tone drones]

08:33.137 --> 08:34.347
What did he say?

08:36.098 --> 08:37.183
Try Dustin again.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.184
He's not answering.

08:38.267 --> 08:40.061
So, try him again.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.189
Dustin, do you copy?

08:43.773 --> 08:46.859
I repeat, this is a code red.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.414
[Dustin]  That keycard opens the door,
but unfortunately,

09:00.498 --> 09:03.459
the Russian with this keycard
also has a massive gun.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.545
Whatever's in this room,
whatever's in those boxes,

09:05.628 --> 09:07.338
they really don't want anybody finding it.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.839
But there's gotta be a way in.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.925
Well, you know...

09:13.219 --> 09:14.262
I could just take him out.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.472
-Take who out?
-The Russian guard.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.474
What? I sneak up behind him,

09:18.558 --> 09:20.601
I knock him out, and I take his keycard.
It's easy.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.895
Did you not hear the part
about the massive gun?

09:22.979 --> 09:24.397
Yes, Dustin, I did.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.316
And that's why I would be sneaking.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.234
Ah.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.111
Well, please, tell me this,
and be honest,

09:30.194 --> 09:32.572
have you ever actually... won a fight?

09:32.655 --> 09:33.948
Okay, that was one time--

09:34.031 --> 09:35.533
Twice. Jonathan. Year prior?

09:35.616 --> 09:36.826
Listen, that doesn't count.

09:36.909 --> 09:39.537
Why wouldn't it? Because it looks
like he beat the shit out of you.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.414
-It was...
-You got a fat lip, crooked nose,

09:41.497 --> 09:43.958
-swollen eye, a lot of blood...
-...things that all added up...

09:44.041 --> 09:45.376
That just might work.

09:47.795 --> 09:48.713
[Steve] Robin.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.965
Hey, Robin!
Hey, what-- what are you doing?

09:51.048 --> 09:52.675
-I need cash.
-Well, half of that's mine.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.719
-Where're you going?
-To find a way into that room,

09:54.802 --> 09:55.761
a safe way.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.763
And, in the meantime,
sling ice cream,

09:57.847 --> 10:00.141
behave, and don't get beat up.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.517
I'll be back in a jiff.

10:03.686 --> 10:04.937
Oh, dude.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.440
Come on, man, not my scooper.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.279
[phone ringing]

10:14.530 --> 10:15.865
[drawer opens, closes]

10:16.866 --> 10:18.659
[man] If he gets us
the layout by noon, we can.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.036
[woman] Okay, I'll let him know.

10:20.745 --> 10:21.704
[makes choking noise]

10:22.413 --> 10:23.914
[laughs]

10:25.833 --> 10:28.586
Dunno if they'll go through with it,
but I just thought you should know.

10:33.007 --> 10:34.842
[suspenseful music playing]

10:35.801 --> 10:36.719
Nancy.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.222
Jonathan.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.893
[Tom]  I've worked at this paper
for twenty-five years.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.728
Twenty-five...

10:46.520 --> 10:47.563
years.

10:48.564 --> 10:49.732
Now, we're a small-town paper,

10:49.815 --> 10:51.692
but we have something
the big papers don't have:

10:52.193 --> 10:53.069
trust.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.197
-The trust of our community.
-Tom, if you just--

10:56.280 --> 10:59.408
Do you know how I built that trust?
By placing my faith in something

10:59.492 --> 11:01.619
the two of you don't seem to value
a whole lot:

11:02.995 --> 11:03.829
facts.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.290
Facts.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.377
So, while we're here,
let's go over the facts.

11:09.460 --> 11:13.798
Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order
to stop pursuing this story.

11:13.881 --> 11:17.051
Two: you falsely identified yourselves
as reporters,

11:17.134 --> 11:19.470
repeatedly lying to an elderly woman.

11:19.553 --> 11:23.432
Three: you broke into her home,
committing trespass.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.476
Four: she almost died en route
to the hospital.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.478
She would've died if we hadn't shown up!

11:27.561 --> 11:30.064
Whatever disease that rat had
clearly passed to her--

11:30.147 --> 11:33.526
Five!
Mrs. Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.196
You didn't know that, did you?

11:38.322 --> 11:39.156
Now...

11:40.199 --> 11:41.492
disease-carrying rats?

11:41.575 --> 11:44.578
The second coming of the plague?
Does this sound credible to you,

11:44.662 --> 11:47.540
or perhaps does this sound more like
the delusions of a very sick old lady?

11:47.623 --> 11:50.334
-I didn't know that.
-Her family's furious.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.420
So furious, in fact,
they've threatened litigation.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.672
-Litigation?
-That's crazy.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.006
For once, we agree.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.717
This is crazy.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.427
In fact, in my entire professional career,

11:59.510 --> 12:01.387
I've never dealt with anything
quite like it.

12:02.638 --> 12:03.472
But hopefully,

12:04.056 --> 12:06.726
hopefully, you've learned
something valuable here.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.019
You've learned...

12:09.770 --> 12:11.021
how in the workplace,

12:11.522 --> 12:12.732
in the real world,

12:12.815 --> 12:15.025
there are consequences to your actions.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.236
Which brings me to my sixth and final...

12:18.362 --> 12:19.280
fact.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.240
You're fired.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.493
Both of you.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.169
[Will]  I didn't think it was anything
at first.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.380
I mean, I think I just didn't want
to believe it.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.718
The first time I felt it
was at  Day of the Dead.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.887
[fluttering sound]

12:42.970 --> 12:45.598
-Power went out that night, too.
-And then I felt it again

12:45.681 --> 12:47.600
at the field near the Nelson farm
the next day.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.684
[gasps]

12:49.143 --> 12:51.729
Then again yesterday outside Castle Byers.

12:51.812 --> 12:52.897
[fluttering sound]

12:52.980 --> 12:54.106
[Lucas] Will!

12:54.190 --> 12:55.566
What does it feel like?

12:56.358 --> 12:57.401
It's almost like...

12:58.319 --> 13:00.279
You know when you drop
on a roller coaster?

13:00.362 --> 13:01.405
-Sure.
-Yeah.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.491
-No.
-It's like...

13:04.158 --> 13:05.826
everything inside your body

13:05.910 --> 13:08.412
is just sinking all at once, but...

13:08.913 --> 13:10.414
this is worse.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.457
Your body...

13:11.957 --> 13:14.668
it goes cold and-- and you can't breathe.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.755
I've felt it before,

13:18.506 --> 13:19.882
whenever he was close.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.801
-[thunderclap]
-[snarling]

13:22.551 --> 13:23.928
Whenever who was close?

13:24.595 --> 13:25.513
The Mind Flayer.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.140
Go away!

13:28.224 --> 13:30.476
Go away!

13:30.976 --> 13:32.812
I closed the gate.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.146
I know, but...

13:35.606 --> 13:36.857
what if he never left?

13:39.693 --> 13:41.612
What if we locked him out here with us?

13:45.533 --> 13:46.784
This is him.

13:46.867 --> 13:47.701
All of him.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.495
But, that day on the field,

13:49.954 --> 13:52.164
a part of him attached itself to me.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.374
[hyperventilating]

13:55.751 --> 13:56.961
My mom got it out of me...

13:57.044 --> 13:59.588
Get the hell out of my son!

14:00.923 --> 14:02.258
...and Eleven closed the gate.

14:02.341 --> 14:06.011
[screaming]

14:06.095 --> 14:09.640
But the part that was still in me,
what if it's still in our world?

14:14.562 --> 14:15.771
In Hawkins.

14:15.855 --> 14:19.191
I don't understand.
The Demodogs died when El closed the gate.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.068
[Max] If the brain dies, the body dies.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.486
We can't take any chances.

14:22.570 --> 14:23.821
We need to assume the worst.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.447
The Mind Flayer's back.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.242
[Will] Yeah. And if he is,

14:28.325 --> 14:30.452
he'd want to attach himself
to someone again.

14:30.661 --> 14:31.579
A new me.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.705
A new host.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.375
How can you tell if someone is a host?

14:48.345 --> 14:49.847
[Hopper grumbles]

14:52.808 --> 14:53.934
Hey, is he in?

14:54.018 --> 14:55.811
-Yes, he's busy at the moment, but--
-Great.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.187
Excuse me.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.564
You should sit down.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.232
...wouldn't listen--

15:01.400 --> 15:02.276
Uh...

15:02.443 --> 15:03.652
Tony, hold on.

15:04.612 --> 15:05.905
Let me, uh...

15:06.030 --> 15:08.657
I might have to--
Let me call you back. Okay.

15:08.949 --> 15:09.950
Thanks.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.286
-Jim.
-I know, I know.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.455
You're busy.
I'm gonna make this fast, I promise.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.165
Is there...

15:16.624 --> 15:17.833
some kind of problem?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.960
Yeah. You might say that.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.254
Um, I'm looking for the name of a guy.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.672
The name of a guy.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.382
Yeah, I think you might know this guy.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.176
-Okay.
-He was here the other day.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.427
Rides a motorcycle.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.682
Big build, square jaw, dark hair.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.935
He's probably military, maybe ex-military?

15:36.644 --> 15:39.271
Is this ringing... any bells?

15:39.355 --> 15:41.023
Uh... [chuckles]

15:41.106 --> 15:42.316
I don't think so.

15:42.399 --> 15:43.484
Really?

15:43.567 --> 15:45.486
'Cause it was just two days ago.

15:45.569 --> 15:46.820
This was right before I saw you.

15:46.904 --> 15:47.738
Oh!

15:47.988 --> 15:49.198
-You know what?
-What?

15:49.281 --> 15:50.616
Could be the maintenance guy.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.701
-Maintenance.
-Yeah. I can't remember his name.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.328
Oh, God... Uh...

15:54.411 --> 15:56.330
Gary or John or something.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.165
Candice will have his name on file.

15:59.416 --> 16:02.044
We've had trouble with the plumbing.
Clogged toilets and...

16:02.503 --> 16:05.297
sinks with minds of their own. [chuckles]

16:05.756 --> 16:08.092
You meeting with a lot of plumbers, Larry?

16:09.301 --> 16:10.135
Excuse me?

16:10.219 --> 16:13.847
This guy, when I saw him,
he was coming out of your office.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.393
Okay, well, I don't remember that.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.895
I shake a lot of hands, you know?

16:24.149 --> 16:27.361
Do you remember when I caught you
passed out in the hideaway

16:27.444 --> 16:29.113
with all that powder all over your nose?

16:29.196 --> 16:31.198
-You remember?
-Jim, come on, now.

16:31.281 --> 16:34.952
Do you remember when my boys
found you and Candice going at it

16:35.035 --> 16:37.246
like a couple of bunnies
in the back of your Cadillac?

16:37.329 --> 16:39.540
Do you remember that?

16:39.623 --> 16:42.543
Does your wife remember that?

16:42.626 --> 16:43.919
You, uh... [clears throat]

16:44.003 --> 16:45.254
You really wanna play this game?

16:45.337 --> 16:46.171
Huh?

16:46.463 --> 16:47.923
Not a game, Lar.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.133
Okay.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.593
Those pills you used to swallow
like candy.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.388
I can't recall,
did you have a prescription for those?

16:54.471 --> 16:56.473
Or how about drinking on duty?

16:57.266 --> 16:58.350
[chuckling]

16:58.434 --> 16:59.351
Yeah.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.938
We have some real fun stories about that.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.774
[chuckles]

17:06.442 --> 17:08.444
One call to Tom at the  Post...

17:09.611 --> 17:10.654
and you're done, buddy.

17:11.697 --> 17:12.614
You're gone.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.616
Oh, and, please,

17:15.325 --> 17:18.245
don't give me that dead daughter
sob story,

17:18.829 --> 17:20.372
'cause I just don't care.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.332
Now, if you don't mind,

17:22.875 --> 17:24.168
I really am rather busy.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.753
Operating directors--

17:25.836 --> 17:28.047
[Larry grunts] Damn it!

17:28.130 --> 17:29.381
[wailing]

17:29.465 --> 17:31.967
My nose! You broke my goddamn nose!

17:32.051 --> 17:33.802
And your friend almost killed me
last night,

17:33.886 --> 17:35.596
so I'd say we're still not even.

17:35.679 --> 17:36.722
Larry?

17:36.847 --> 17:38.766
-[Hopper] Let's cut the crap, Larry!
-Larry!

17:38.849 --> 17:41.477
-Who is this guy? Government? Military?
-You're making a big mistake.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.519
Who is he?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.146
It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.190
-[Candice] Larry!
-[Larry groans]

17:47.816 --> 17:49.610
Who you calling? The police?

17:53.864 --> 17:57.076
That is a nice ring you got there, Larry.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.577
Are you insane?

17:58.660 --> 17:59.620
I don't know.

18:00.079 --> 18:00.996
Let's find out.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.874
[grunts] Okay, okay, okay.
Be cool, be cool.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.503
I don't know his name, I swear.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.464
-[sighs]
-[screams] Ah, ah, ah!

18:10.547 --> 18:11.882
But you know him.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.094
He... He gives me things sometimes.

18:15.177 --> 18:16.261
What kind of things?

18:16.345 --> 18:18.889
Money. Presents. Aah! Gifts.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.224
Who is this guy, Santa Claus?

18:20.307 --> 18:22.351
Starcourt. Starcourt.
He works for Starcourt.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.728
-The mall?
-Yes, yes.

18:24.812 --> 18:25.979
Yeah, right.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.982
Aah! I swear! I swear! I swear! Starcourt.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.067
They-- They own the mall.

18:30.150 --> 18:33.612
They want to expand to East Hawkins.
They needed property, some land.

18:33.695 --> 18:37.366
Some people didn't want to sell,
so I leaned on them a little. That's all.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.451
I swear, that's all.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.079
[sighs, groans]

18:42.788 --> 18:43.664
[groans]

18:44.331 --> 18:46.959
-Why do they want this land?
-I don't know!

18:47.042 --> 18:48.961
You have records of these purchases,
these, uh...

18:49.545 --> 18:50.921
these land purchases?

18:52.214 --> 18:54.216
[breathing rapidly]

18:54.716 --> 18:56.468
You don't want to mess with these people,
Jim.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.888
I think you should worry about yourself
right now, Larry, not about me.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.349
The records.

19:03.142 --> 19:03.976
Where are they?

19:04.059 --> 19:06.019
-[Larry groans]
-Larry?

19:06.103 --> 19:07.437
[Hopper] He just bumped his head.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.773
-Just a little boo-boo, right, Lar?
-[grunts]

19:10.524 --> 19:11.733
Have a nice day.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.026
Larry!

19:14.736 --> 19:15.904
[Nancy] It's bullshit.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.408
So, according to Tom,
Driscoll's just a schizophrenic?

19:19.700 --> 19:21.618
And that rat is just a rat?

19:21.702 --> 19:23.829
And it's all, what, some big coincidence?

19:24.413 --> 19:25.372
You know what I think?

19:25.873 --> 19:27.082
I think Tom was on drugs.

19:27.666 --> 19:28.584
-What?
-Did you see him?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.335
He was sweating like crazy.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.503
And his palms were clammy.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.130
-He looked awful.
-[chuckles]

19:33.213 --> 19:35.549
-Oh, is this funny to you?
-No.

19:35.632 --> 19:37.384
No, it's just kind of incredible.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.635
Incredible?

19:38.719 --> 19:41.513
Yeah, incredible how you just continue
to convince yourself.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.848
What's that supposed to mean?

19:42.931 --> 19:45.851
I told you over and over
to drop this story.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.978
-That it was a bad idea.
-[scoffs]

19:48.061 --> 19:50.355
But you refused, and now, I'm screwed.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.691
It's a summer job.
Your life is hardly over.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.985
I don't live in a two-story house
on Maple Street.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.570
My dad doesn't earn six figures.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.071
Hell, he isn't even around.

19:58.155 --> 19:59.740
God, here comes the Oliver Twist routine.

19:59.823 --> 20:01.825
Mortgage, college tuition.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.869
You know, they're real things, Nancy.

20:03.952 --> 20:06.538
Things that you don't care about,
only because you don't have to.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.208
-I didn't realize I lived in a bubble!
-Well, you do!

20:09.291 --> 20:11.668
You want everything handed to you
on a silver platter.

20:11.752 --> 20:14.129
I mean, we were interns, Nancy!

20:14.213 --> 20:15.631
Interns!

20:16.381 --> 20:19.384
What did you expect, that you would make
star reporter in a month?

20:19.468 --> 20:20.802
Crack the big case?

20:20.886 --> 20:23.347
You sound just like them.
You realize that, right?

20:23.430 --> 20:24.932
Just like Bruce and those assholes--

20:25.015 --> 20:27.100
Yeah, yeah, those assholes gave us jobs.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.978
Is that what that was?
That was humiliating.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.396
Humiliating.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.023
Yeah, the real world sucks.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.400
Deal with it like the rest of us.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.571
You don't know what it's like.

20:41.615 --> 20:42.616
Neither do you.

20:43.116 --> 20:44.034
[scoffs]

20:44.493 --> 20:48.580
Well, then, I guess we just don't
understand each other anymore.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.124
Yeah, I guess not.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.511
Hey, you're home early.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.721
Yeah. Light day.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.139
[Nancy sniffles]

21:14.398 --> 21:16.483
[Robin]  It is fascinating
what 20 bucks will get you

21:16.566 --> 21:18.110
at the County Recorder's Office.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.696
Starcourt Mall.

21:20.779 --> 21:21.822
The complete blueprints.

21:21.905 --> 21:23.115
Not bad.

21:23.198 --> 21:24.825
So, this is us, Scoops,

21:24.908 --> 21:26.743
and this is where we want to get.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.287
I mean, I don't really see a way in.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.288
There's not,

21:29.371 --> 21:33.166
if you're talking exclusively about doors.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.002
Air ducts.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.128
Exactly.

21:36.211 --> 21:40.007
Turns out, this secret room needs air
just like any old room.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.718
And these air ducts

21:43.302 --> 21:45.053
lead all the way...

21:48.890 --> 21:49.725
here.

21:58.525 --> 21:59.526
Flashlight.

22:00.610 --> 22:01.653
Thank you.

22:05.073 --> 22:08.118
Yeah, I don't know, man. I don't know
if you can fit in here. It's, like...

22:08.452 --> 22:09.661
super tight.

22:09.745 --> 22:10.620
I'll fit.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.622
Trust me. No collar bones, remember?

22:12.706 --> 22:13.790
Uh, excuse me?

22:15.625 --> 22:17.961
Oh, he's, uh...
Yeah, he's got some disease.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.047
Chry, uh... It's chrydo, um...

22:20.839 --> 22:21.965
Something. Yeah, I dunno.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.051
He's missing bones and stuff.
He can bend like Gumbo.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.677
You mean Gumby.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.304
I'm pretty sure it's Gumbo.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.348
-Steve, just shut up and push me!
-Okay.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.225
I'll push ya.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.645
-Not my feet, dumbass. Push my ass.
-[Steve] What?

22:35.729 --> 22:37.314
Touch my butt! I don't care!

22:37.397 --> 22:39.691
-Come on! Harder! Push harder!
-I'm pushing!

22:39.775 --> 22:43.403
-You're playing with my legs.
-I'm not playing, I have terrible footing.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.405
-Come on!
-I'm gonna just shove you, ready?

22:45.489 --> 22:47.282
-[Dustin] Just shove me?
-One, two...

22:47.366 --> 22:49.117
-Shit.
-[Steve] That work?

22:49.201 --> 22:51.870
-[Dustin] One more time.
-Ahoy, sailors! All hands on deck!

22:51.953 --> 22:52.913
Ahoy!

22:52.996 --> 22:54.414
-[bell dinging]
-[Erica] Come on.

22:54.498 --> 22:56.750
Get over here
and serve me some samples.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.630
I don't know.
He looks pretty normal to me.

23:01.963 --> 23:05.425
Normal? How many times
have you seen him with a shirt on?

23:06.093 --> 23:07.677
I mean, it's a little weird.

23:07.761 --> 23:08.762
More than a little.

23:08.845 --> 23:11.723
He was in a tub with ice.
The Mind Flayer likes it cold.

23:12.307 --> 23:15.143
-Plus everything else--
-But he's lounging at the pool,

23:15.227 --> 23:17.437
which is, like,
the least Mind Flayer thing ever.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.022
Not necessarily.

23:20.315 --> 23:22.567
The Mind Flayer likes to hide.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.319
He only used me when he needed me.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.489
It's like... like you're dormant.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.492
And then, when he needs you,

23:31.785 --> 23:32.744
you're activated.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.955
Okay, so we just...

23:35.038 --> 23:36.498
wait until he gets activated.

23:36.665 --> 23:37.999
No. What if he hurts someone?

23:38.083 --> 23:39.084
Or kills someone.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.627
We can't take that chance.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.712
We need to find out if he's the host.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.466
-Where are you going?
-I have an idea. Boys only.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.468
-Seriously?
-Just trust me on this one.

23:55.183 --> 23:58.270
Okay, so we wait until the pool closes,
until everyone leaves,

23:58.353 --> 24:01.356
and we somehow get him
to come from here and...

24:03.733 --> 24:04.943
get him into here.

24:07.362 --> 24:10.198
-Hey, shut the door!
-[man] Hey, come on, kid, shut it!

24:12.492 --> 24:14.494
I think I just threw up in my mouth.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.038
And look, the controls are right here.
It's perfect.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.124
-Will it get hot enough?
-220 degrees.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.543
We just have to figure out
how to get him in here.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.211
-Then we lock him in...
-Heat him up...

24:23.295 --> 24:25.589
No matter what happens, we'll know.

24:26.131 --> 24:26.965
We'll know for sure.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.389
Hmm...

24:36.057 --> 24:38.977
-Yeah, I don't know.
-You don't know if you can fit?

24:39.060 --> 24:41.771
Oh, I can fit.
I just don't know if I want to.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.106
Are you claustrophobic?

24:43.190 --> 24:45.150
[snickers] I don't have phobias.

24:45.817 --> 24:48.612
-Okay, well, what's the problem?
-The problem is,

24:48.695 --> 24:50.697
I still haven't heard what's in this

24:51.072 --> 24:52.449
for Erica.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.369
[nautical tune playing]

25:00.665 --> 25:01.958
More fudge, please.

25:03.919 --> 25:04.920
Go on.

25:10.425 --> 25:11.301
[Robin] All right.

25:12.969 --> 25:16.014
You see this?
This is the route you're gonna take.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.808
Then we just wait till the last delivery
goes out tonight.

25:18.892 --> 25:21.603
Then you knock out the grate,
jump down, open the door.

25:21.686 --> 25:24.564
-Then you find out what's in those boxes?
-Exactly.

25:24.648 --> 25:25.565
[Erica] Mm-hmm.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.359
And you say this guard is armed.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.027
Yes, but he won't be there.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.071
-And booby traps?
-Booby traps?

25:31.154 --> 25:33.490
-Lasers, spikes in the wall?
-What?

25:33.573 --> 25:36.785
You know what this half-baked plan
of yours sounds like to me?

25:37.327 --> 25:38.954
Child endangerment.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.997
We'll be in radio contact with you
the whole time--

25:41.081 --> 25:42.415
Ah, ah, ah!

25:42.499 --> 25:44.918
Child endangerment.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.879
Erica? Hi. Uh...

25:47.963 --> 25:51.675
We think these Russians
want to do harm to our country.

25:51.758 --> 25:54.386
Great harm. Don't you love your country?

25:54.469 --> 25:57.097
You can't spell "America" without "Erica."

25:57.806 --> 25:59.849
[slurping loudly]

25:59.933 --> 26:01.601
Uh, yeah, yeah.

26:02.310 --> 26:04.312
Oddly, that's, uh, totally true.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.314
So, so, don't do this for us.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.774
Do it for your country.

26:07.857 --> 26:10.151
Do it for your fellow man.

26:10.235 --> 26:13.780
-[slurping continues]
-Do this for America... Erica.

26:15.490 --> 26:16.449
Ooh!

26:16.533 --> 26:18.118
I just got the chills.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.078
Oh, yeah, from this float,

26:20.161 --> 26:21.371
not your speech.

26:21.871 --> 26:24.416
Know what I love most about this country?

26:24.499 --> 26:25.542
Capitalism.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.544
-Do you know what capitalism is?
-Yeah.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.964
-Yeah.
-It means this is a free market system.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.216
Which means people get paid
for their services,

26:33.300 --> 26:36.011
depending on how valuable
their contributions are.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.512
And it seems to me,

26:37.596 --> 26:40.557
my ability to fit into that little vent

26:40.640 --> 26:43.226
is very, very valuable to you all.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.604
So, you want my help?

26:45.687 --> 26:47.439
This USS  Butterscotch

26:47.522 --> 26:49.566
better be the first of many.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.860
And I'm talking free ice cream

26:52.402 --> 26:54.321
for life.

27:02.579 --> 27:03.622
[Hopper whistles]

27:03.705 --> 27:05.415
Wow, I love the place, Lar.

27:05.498 --> 27:07.876
Hey, you shoot that fella yourself?

27:07.959 --> 27:10.420
[Larry winces] That's-- That's not real.

27:10.503 --> 27:12.714
No shit!

27:27.270 --> 27:28.188
All right, so...

27:28.855 --> 27:30.774
what exactly are we looking at?

27:30.857 --> 27:33.193
Land deeds, transfers of property.

27:33.276 --> 27:34.694
So your buddies at Starcourt,

27:34.778 --> 27:37.238
they suddenly start buying up
all this property.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.116
-They tell you why?
-I already told you,

27:40.200 --> 27:41.368
they don't tell me anything.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.078
They're just using you, I get it.

27:43.161 --> 27:44.371
What I don't get

27:44.454 --> 27:47.874
is why you have a bunch of land deeds

27:47.957 --> 27:50.460
in a safe in your bedroom.

27:50.543 --> 27:51.878
These people, Jim,

27:53.254 --> 27:54.547
they're bad news.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.216
So, what, this is blackmail?

27:56.299 --> 27:58.468
-Protection.
-Protection.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.345
Hold on a second.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.349
Hey, what is it?

28:04.599 --> 28:06.726
Hess Farm, Henry's place,

28:06.810 --> 28:07.936
Bullocks...

28:08.103 --> 28:09.354
Look, they're all here.

28:09.437 --> 28:12.607
They're all in Southeast Hawkins,
right near Jordan Lake.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.526
And what else is near Jordan Lake?

28:15.110 --> 28:16.152
The power plant.

28:16.236 --> 28:19.239
Four nights ago,
there was a huge power outage,

28:19.322 --> 28:21.366
-and the next day--
-Your magnets fell.

28:21.449 --> 28:24.285
Yeah, I mean, Scott says that this machine

28:24.369 --> 28:26.955
would take a massive amount of power
to run.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.165
-Yeah.
-So, what if this machine

28:29.249 --> 28:32.001
that we've been talking about
really does exist,

28:32.085 --> 28:33.920
and the reason that we didn't find it
at the lab

28:34.003 --> 28:37.215
is because it isn't at the lab,
it's at one of these properties.

28:38.341 --> 28:39.259
Um...

28:39.634 --> 28:42.429
I want you to...   forget about sales.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.597
I want you to come work for me
at the Hawkins PD.

28:44.681 --> 28:47.517
And have to look at your face every day?
I don't think so.

28:48.184 --> 28:49.144
[clattering]

28:51.020 --> 28:52.105
Larry!

28:52.188 --> 28:53.231
Hey!

28:54.733 --> 28:57.193
Hey, where do you think you're going, pal?

28:57.444 --> 28:58.278
[Larry screams]

29:01.489 --> 29:03.658
-[knocking]
-[Karen] Nancy?

29:05.702 --> 29:06.786
Nance?

29:19.424 --> 29:20.467
[sniffles]

29:25.138 --> 29:27.015
[Nancy]  Maybe Jonathan's right.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.351
To be honest, I wasn't thinking about him.

29:31.227 --> 29:33.229
I wasn't thinking about anyone, really.

29:34.397 --> 29:35.315
I just...

29:36.274 --> 29:37.525
I wanted to be right.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.905
-I wanted to be right so badly.
-And were you?

29:41.988 --> 29:43.698
I thought so.

29:45.658 --> 29:46.951
But maybe I just...

29:48.077 --> 29:49.662
don't want to admit that I'm wrong,

29:49.746 --> 29:53.166
-because if I'm wrong, then--
-You're what everyone thinks you are.

29:53.249 --> 29:55.960
Just a kid who has no idea
what she's doing.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.091
[sighs]

30:02.717 --> 30:04.594
It's not easy out there, Nance.

30:04.677 --> 30:05.678
I know.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.141
People are always saying you can't.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.435
That you shouldn't.

30:14.813 --> 30:15.814
That you're not...

30:16.314 --> 30:18.525
smart enough, not good enough.

30:20.026 --> 30:21.152
[sighs]

30:22.070 --> 30:23.488
This world, it...

30:24.864 --> 30:28.284
it beats you up again and again
until eventually, I...

30:30.453 --> 30:31.955
Most people, they just...

30:32.956 --> 30:34.290
they just stop trying.

30:40.755 --> 30:42.215
But you're not like that.

30:43.633 --> 30:44.843
You're a fighter.

30:45.593 --> 30:46.970
You always have been.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.723
I honestly don't know
where you get it from. [chuckles]

30:51.224 --> 30:52.225
Dad.

30:54.435 --> 30:55.937
[both laugh]

30:57.564 --> 31:01.150
I think you were swapped in the hospital,
to tell you the truth.

31:01.776 --> 31:02.652
No.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.532
I get it from you, Mom.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.203
I get it from you.

31:17.667 --> 31:19.460
Well, wherever you get it from,

31:21.337 --> 31:22.297
I'm proud of you.

31:23.339 --> 31:25.008
Proud of me for getting fired?

31:25.967 --> 31:28.344
That you stood up for yourself.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.430
That you stood up to those...

31:30.513 --> 31:31.472
shitheads.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.433
Mom!

31:33.516 --> 31:35.268
Yes, those shitheads.

31:35.351 --> 31:36.853
[chuckles, sniffles]

31:36.936 --> 31:38.938
And if you believe in this story...

31:39.606 --> 31:40.732
Look at me, Nancy.

31:42.650 --> 31:43.610
...finish it.

31:45.945 --> 31:49.949
Then go sell it to  The Indianapolis Star
or whatever and...

31:50.783 --> 31:52.160
I mean, can you imagine their faces

31:52.243 --> 31:54.078
when they read a story
about their own town

31:54.162 --> 31:55.997
in a big paper like that?

31:56.539 --> 31:57.999
That would be...

31:59.584 --> 32:00.793
pretty amazing.

32:02.378 --> 32:03.671
So, why not?

32:07.091 --> 32:08.301
Why not?

32:09.719 --> 32:10.720
Finish it.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.689
[suspenseful music playing]

32:25.193 --> 32:26.152
[lighter clicks]

32:35.286 --> 32:36.245
Uh, Will?

32:37.246 --> 32:38.957
Um, you know, about yesterday...

32:39.791 --> 32:41.042
It's fine, Lucas.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.627
You don't have to say anything.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.712
I know, but it's just...

32:46.714 --> 32:48.216
It was a really cool campaign.

32:48.299 --> 32:51.219
-And Mike and I, we should've never--
-I don't care anymore, Lucas.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.345
I really don't.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.306
We have bigger things to worry about now.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.437
This should hold him.

33:08.528 --> 33:09.404
[Mike sighs]

33:09.487 --> 33:10.822
Hey, I found the breakers.

33:11.906 --> 33:14.826
Whoa, that thing is super creepy.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.035
Let me see it.

33:16.911 --> 33:19.080
I think this'll work. Right, buddy?

33:19.163 --> 33:20.373
[in squeaky voice] Right, Mike.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.583
[Mike chuckles]

33:26.212 --> 33:27.255
Hey, El...

33:29.090 --> 33:31.092
I just wanted to say...

33:32.343 --> 33:34.095
You know when I said Nana was sick?

-I know.
-Right, right, right.  No, I just...

Hopper, he went all crazy on me,

33:43.730 --> 33:45.690
telling me I'm spending
way too much time with you.

33:45.773 --> 33:47.608
