WEBVTT

00:03.352 --> 00:04.168
Oh!

00:04.196 --> 00:05.751
Touchdown!

00:05.776 --> 00:08.265
- You mean "home run," Spidey.
- I knew that.

00:14.302 --> 00:15.898
Water and electricity?

00:15.923 --> 00:18.239
I'd say you're coming up
short, Shocker.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.887
Get it? That's electricity
comedy, kids.

00:20.922 --> 00:23.381
Web-Warriors rule!

00:23.406 --> 00:27.977
Me and Spidey, like, the best
buds of all time, ever!

00:28.012 --> 00:31.151
Awesome bros before evil foes.

00:31.282 --> 00:34.134
Nothing says BFFs like
Spidey and Agent Venom

00:34.159 --> 00:36.283
taking down a series
of super-villains together.

00:36.308 --> 00:39.312
<i>Since we learned Doc Ock is
staffing up a new Sinister Six,</i>

00:39.337 --> 00:42.054
<i>the Web-Warriors have been on
a baddie-busting spree,</i>

00:42.079 --> 00:45.715
<i>trying to catch all of his possible
recruits before Ock can get to them first.</i>

00:45.873 --> 00:48.693
There are more subtle
ways to steal a truck, Beetle!

00:57.550 --> 00:59.948
I call
that a "Flash landing."

00:59.973 --> 01:01.437
That's what I call it.

01:01.449 --> 01:03.650
Beetle. Beat-en.

01:15.315 --> 01:16.215
Whoa!

01:18.113 --> 01:19.536
Someone's updated his wardrobe.

01:19.572 --> 01:21.587
Ock must have gotten to Beetle first.

01:27.831 --> 01:28.883
Huh?

01:30.744 --> 01:32.593
Wait! What's the rush?

01:32.618 --> 01:36.086
Don't you have anything to say first?
Maybe some puns, victorious gloating?

01:36.570 --> 01:38.504
So I'll take that as a no?

01:39.285 --> 01:42.485
Sync and corrections by <font color="#808040">masaca</font>
- addic7ed.com -

01:52.169 --> 01:55.200
Spidey sense says,
"This is gonna hurt!"

01:58.456 --> 02:00.330
I got your back, Spider-Man.

02:00.355 --> 02:03.363
The Patrioteer? AKA Harry Osborn.

02:03.388 --> 02:05.279
When I'm Peter Parker,
he's my best friend.

02:05.304 --> 02:07.362
But he doesn't know that I'm Spider-Man.

02:23.309 --> 02:27.154
Nice armor. Prepare to be hacked.

02:31.991 --> 02:33.569
O...kay.

02:35.474 --> 02:37.355
The back of his helmet!
It's unprotected!

02:37.378 --> 02:39.371
Read you loud and clear, Spidey.

02:43.209 --> 02:45.662
Okay, I... I've got
control of his armor.

02:45.687 --> 02:48.798
Let's see how those little
wings hold up at 10,000 feet.

02:55.612 --> 02:57.384
Only your second time in that armor?

02:57.409 --> 02:59.008
Have you been practicing
in front of the mirror?

02:59.033 --> 03:02.565
Uh, hello! Beetle totally got away!

03:02.590 --> 03:03.733
Wait for it.

03:07.184 --> 03:09.113
You're like a superhero prodigy!

03:09.138 --> 03:13.259
I hope "prodigy" is an insult,
because he stole our win.

03:13.982 --> 03:16.322
Uh-oh. Beetle's
trying to get control back.

03:16.347 --> 03:17.718
He's deleting a file.

03:20.359 --> 03:21.425
Nice try, Beets.

03:21.461 --> 03:24.123
What information was so important
that he had to dump it?

03:24.462 --> 03:26.010
I'm guessing once we decrypt it,

03:26.035 --> 03:28.320
it'll finally give us
Doc Ock's secret location.

03:28.345 --> 03:30.022
Code-breaking's
not my strong suit.

03:30.047 --> 03:32.176
But it is S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.
Come back with us.

03:32.630 --> 03:35.636
Really? I've always
wanted to see the Triskelion.

03:35.661 --> 03:36.807
Meet you there!

03:38.129 --> 03:41.224
Are you sure we should
give that amateur access?

03:41.249 --> 03:42.495
He'll see everything.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.059
All of our secret agent stuff.

03:45.084 --> 03:46.622
He showed some serious skill.

03:46.647 --> 03:48.777
Maybe we could recruit him
into S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.

03:48.802 --> 03:50.154
Wouldn't that be awesome?

03:52.197 --> 03:54.966
I'm supposed to be Spidey's best bud,

03:54.991 --> 03:56.975
not Newbie McNewsome.

03:57.659 --> 04:01.244
Steal my symbiote
back, will you, Spider-Man?

04:01.269 --> 04:04.243
But you left behind the tiniest sample.

04:04.268 --> 04:06.055
All I need...

04:06.086 --> 04:10.048
<i>Dr. Octavius, Shocker and Boomerang were
captured before Hydra could make contact.</i>

04:10.073 --> 04:11.982
<i>And we've lost communication
with Beetle.</i>

04:12.007 --> 04:14.234
I knew Beetle was useless.

04:14.259 --> 04:18.535
I'm losing all viable recruits
for the Six, thanks to my most hated foe!

04:18.824 --> 04:23.704
But this, the web-crawler
will be unable to stop.

04:23.740 --> 04:27.117
It's "wall-crawler," is it not?

04:27.915 --> 04:30.259
Here to berate me again, Zola?

04:30.352 --> 04:32.343
Not at all.

04:32.368 --> 04:36.081
Hydra greatly values our partnership.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.747
Forgive me if I'm skeptical.

04:38.772 --> 04:44.455
Last I recall, I was wasting your time
and resources by chasing Spider-Man.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.836
We disagree only about priorities.

04:47.930 --> 04:51.945
But to show our support, I'm
assigning you a new lab assistant.

04:51.970 --> 04:54.001
Dr. Michael Morbius.

04:54.026 --> 04:57.346
It's such an honor to be working
with the great Otto Octavius.

04:57.371 --> 05:00.894
- I've studied all your work.
- Hmph! Yes, as well you should.

05:00.919 --> 05:03.759
Tell me, Doctor, how do you
keep neural pathways stable

05:03.784 --> 05:06.811
while a symbiote's genetic
code is being rewritten?

05:06.991 --> 05:12.061
Well! That question is not nearly as
ignorant as I would have expected.

05:12.158 --> 05:13.784
Temperature serves as...

05:14.214 --> 05:16.408
But why tell you my secrets?

05:16.433 --> 05:19.031
I work alone. Remove
yourself from my lab.

05:19.056 --> 05:20.823
Hydra's lab.

05:20.848 --> 05:27.534
My eight-armed friend, you
must accept our complete support.

05:28.589 --> 05:31.654
Put on some gloves, Dr. Morbius.

05:31.679 --> 05:34.485
If you are going to remain
here, spying for Zola,

05:34.510 --> 05:36.380
you may as well make yourself useful.

05:37.057 --> 05:40.090
I was right. Ock was
tracking Beetle's location.

05:40.342 --> 05:42.516
Now let's see if we can
turn that right back on him.

05:42.628 --> 05:45.183
Huh. This mainframe's impressive.

05:45.208 --> 05:47.088
Nothing but the best
at S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy.

05:47.113 --> 05:49.225
While this routine's
breaking Ock's encryption,

05:49.250 --> 05:50.850
let me be your campus tour guide.

05:52.406 --> 05:54.113
I never got a tour.

05:54.382 --> 05:57.901
Holographic AV and group
interfaces in every classroom.

05:57.926 --> 05:58.942
Just sayin'.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.501
Not bad!

06:00.526 --> 06:04.618
Cool classrooms do not make the teachers
here any less boring. Trust me.

06:06.721 --> 06:09.840
Our training courses challenge
the mind and the body!

06:13.515 --> 06:16.955
Yes! Beat my best time
by two-tenths. Nailed it!

06:16.980 --> 06:19.101
- That's so cool!
- It's okay,

06:19.126 --> 06:22.052
assuming the robots don't
malfunction and try to kill you.

06:22.077 --> 06:26.393
That only happened, like, one time.
Or a dozen. Let's check out the labs.

06:28.418 --> 06:32.529
Told ya. These science labs are
dinky compared to Oscorp, I bet.

06:32.554 --> 06:35.201
Venom. Why are you showing
Harry the storage closet?

06:35.254 --> 06:36.378
Come into the main lab.

06:36.414 --> 06:38.469
Whoa! Awesome!

06:38.494 --> 06:41.214
Good joke, Venom.
I thought you were serious.

06:42.439 --> 06:44.949
An exo-planetary
atmospheric analyzer?

06:44.974 --> 06:47.416
I thought these were years
away from being ready.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.761
It's a prototype. Seen enough?

06:49.786 --> 06:52.952
Yeah. Who do I have to talk
to about joining? Nick Fury?

06:52.977 --> 06:57.217
Fury's not around right now. He's
on an undercover mission, we hope.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.059
Then who's in charge of the Academy?

06:59.084 --> 07:03.208
- Well, I guess me, so, you're in!
- Hooray.

07:04.407 --> 07:07.092
Does that alarm go off every
time you get a new recruit?

07:07.128 --> 07:09.433
No! It must be an intruder!

07:13.108 --> 07:15.159
Okay. Be prepared for anything.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.624
This could be Doc Ock,
or Arnim Zola, or...

07:18.735 --> 07:19.688
Ahhh!

07:22.768 --> 07:24.919
Norman Osborn, the Iron Patriot?

07:24.944 --> 07:26.784
Dad, what are you doing here?

07:26.809 --> 07:29.532
I checked the GPS tag
on the Patrioteer armor.

07:29.551 --> 07:33.124
Imagine my surprise to find you
at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters.

07:33.149 --> 07:36.213
You're tracking me? So much for
treating me like an adult.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.685
Busted, dude. Guess you gotta go.

07:38.710 --> 07:42.017
Oh, well. It's been fun.
Not.

07:42.042 --> 07:44.295
Wait. Harry found a file
on Beetle's armor

07:44.320 --> 07:46.388
that could lead us to
Doc Ock's secret location.

07:46.413 --> 07:48.171
Beetle? The super-villain?

07:48.210 --> 07:50.434
I gave you that armor to protect you,

07:50.459 --> 07:53.247
not to fly into dangerous situations.

07:53.272 --> 07:55.776
Oh, your dad's got a really good point.

07:55.801 --> 07:58.353
Norman, if you could quit
stormin' for a second,

07:58.393 --> 08:01.695
weren't you the one who decided to
give Harry the limit to become a hero?

08:01.815 --> 08:02.999
I did.

08:03.244 --> 08:06.759
But remember, I lost Harry before.
To the Venom symbiote.

08:06.784 --> 08:08.990
You couldn't know what that's like.

08:09.015 --> 08:12.085
You can't give Harry heavy ordnance
and expect him to sit out a fight.

08:12.427 --> 08:13.921
Not the way he looks up to you.

08:13.998 --> 08:15.324
He's just a boy.

08:15.349 --> 08:17.837
And this is a school.
So let him train here.

08:17.862 --> 08:19.269
I'll personally look after him.

08:19.294 --> 08:21.166
If you really want to do this, Harry,

08:21.309 --> 08:23.525
promise me you'll be safe.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.884
Wait! What? You're lettin' him join?

08:26.948 --> 08:29.016
Dad, not in front of the guys.

08:29.202 --> 08:33.440
Spider-Man, you're accountable
if anything happens.

08:33.465 --> 08:36.610
Taking care of my son is
a great responsibility.

08:36.770 --> 08:38.029
I'm good at those.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.373
Boom! A potential location.

08:47.398 --> 08:49.358
I'm thinking a small team
of, oh, I don't know

08:49.383 --> 08:51.248
three handsome young heroes
should go scout it out.

08:51.273 --> 08:54.826
Agreed. It's time for Doc
Ock to get a delivery of,

08:54.851 --> 08:58.510
uh, from us, of, of justice...

08:59.342 --> 09:01.498
How was that for hero-talk?
Was it lame?

09:02.084 --> 09:03.802
- Yes.
- Don't worry.

09:03.827 --> 09:05.615
Captain America teaches
a unit about it.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.780
Now let's go and knock some Ock!

09:08.805 --> 09:10.868
Yeah, Venom skipped that class.

09:11.727 --> 09:12.724
All right, guys.

09:13.479 --> 09:15.962
Ock prides himself on
being one step ahead of us.

09:15.987 --> 09:18.477
Let's show him what it feels
like to be outsmarted.

09:18.661 --> 09:20.562
Web-Warriors, assemble.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.592
Hello, fellow bad guys.
I, I mean, hail.

09:29.628 --> 09:30.901
Hail Hydra!

09:32.188 --> 09:34.816
You know, cut off one thing,
then you have two things?

09:35.158 --> 09:36.158
Hydra!

09:40.439 --> 09:42.613
Come on. Ock's
around here somewhere.

09:42.693 --> 09:44.899
Yeah, I'm not sure this
is a mission for a newbie.

09:44.924 --> 09:47.114
We could be uncovering
a whole Hydra base.

09:54.325 --> 09:56.517
Hello, secret entrance to Hydra lair.

09:57.135 --> 09:57.896
See?

09:57.921 --> 10:01.928
If Doc Ock finds out we're comin',
it could get messy, real quick.

10:01.953 --> 10:04.094
You're right, Venom.
We just came to scout.

10:04.119 --> 10:05.827
Let's call reinforcements before...

10:06.159 --> 10:07.101
Harry?

10:07.635 --> 10:09.116
We're not done scouting yet.

10:09.148 --> 10:11.029
There goes your responsibility.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.702
You know, if I remember right,

10:12.738 --> 10:15.622
one of us said he was too
green to go on this mission.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.360
Hint, it was me.

10:17.385 --> 10:19.038
Harry can handle more than you realize.

10:19.063 --> 10:21.940
I used to think someone else
on this team was too green.

10:22.221 --> 10:25.199
Oh, really? Who was it? Cho?

10:27.158 --> 10:28.123
Halt!

10:35.724 --> 10:37.803
You still think he can handle this?

10:37.828 --> 10:39.462
- Stealthiness is an acquired skill.
- Yeah!

10:39.487 --> 10:41.329
You're always stickin' up for him.

10:41.354 --> 10:45.608
All of your mainframes and computers,
you guys are two peas in a pot.

10:46.116 --> 10:48.775
You mean "pod."
But how cool is this?

10:48.800 --> 10:50.371
I'm on a spy mission
with my best friend.

10:50.396 --> 10:53.231
Even though he doesn't know
it's me, still kinda counts.

10:54.059 --> 10:57.732
Must be great to have your best
bud of all time around.

10:59.309 --> 11:00.707
Uh, Venom?

11:03.766 --> 11:08.092
Oh, bah! This is infuriating!
I must succeed!

11:08.117 --> 11:11.958
Um, I'm sure you've considered
a ten-nanosecond intron pulse

11:11.983 --> 11:14.181
- rather than a steady stream?
- Of course.

11:14.206 --> 11:17.962
That would induce a refractory phase
in the cells and better absorb the energy.

11:18.412 --> 11:21.714
- It seems upset.
- Hmm. They always do.

11:21.739 --> 11:24.766
The change can be unsettling.

11:24.802 --> 11:26.684
Doctor, we did it!

11:26.720 --> 11:28.895
At last. Success!

11:28.920 --> 11:32.155
Morbius, your very minor
contribution has been noted.

11:32.180 --> 11:33.340
You're too kind.

11:33.365 --> 11:38.026
But we didn't do it.
The great Otto Octavius did.

11:38.051 --> 11:39.784
Oh, uh, of course, Doctor.

11:39.809 --> 11:41.613
You say jump, I'll ask how...

11:41.849 --> 11:43.676
Did you see that?

11:44.233 --> 11:46.298
Jump. Go flat.

11:46.503 --> 11:48.815
It's responding to commands.

11:48.851 --> 11:51.467
Flip. Fight.

11:53.916 --> 11:59.230
This newly enhanced symbiote will finally
bring about Spider-Man's downfall.

11:59.255 --> 12:01.719
Sounds like that thing's
designed to target you, Spidey.

12:01.744 --> 12:03.801
- Better let me take the lead.
- Shh!

12:03.826 --> 12:07.105
If anybody's protecting
Spidey, it's me.

12:07.130 --> 12:10.550
You're both really good, guys,
but stop talking before...

12:10.575 --> 12:11.437
Ahhh!

12:12.035 --> 12:14.976
Remember the good old days, when
this was just a scouting trip?

12:15.968 --> 12:17.682
Guards! Guards!

12:17.707 --> 12:22.114
Remain calm, Morbius. This is
not altogether unforeseen.

12:22.793 --> 12:24.322
Attack, my pet!

12:28.023 --> 12:29.914
Get back, Spidey.
I'll protect you.

12:30.577 --> 12:32.523
No chance, Osborn!

12:32.786 --> 12:34.712
What sweet irony.

12:34.737 --> 12:37.728
You feel you must
defend Spider-Man?

12:39.697 --> 12:42.884
The new symbiote isn't targeting him.

12:43.126 --> 12:44.599
Huh? It isn't?

12:45.586 --> 12:47.261
It attacks other symbiotes!

12:55.036 --> 12:56.321
What's it doing to him?

12:56.346 --> 12:57.771
It is purging him.

12:57.789 --> 13:00.883
How does it feel to watch
your dear friend suffer?

13:02.087 --> 13:03.367
You hear that?

13:03.786 --> 13:06.163
He called me "Spidey's dear friend."

13:08.087 --> 13:09.995
Patrioteer, a little help here?

13:10.591 --> 13:13.514
But... I can't. The symbiote...

13:13.539 --> 13:15.857
It once took me over.

13:19.449 --> 13:20.997
Keep, keep it away from me!

13:22.729 --> 13:26.522
Oh, I see. Norman's brat son.

13:26.547 --> 13:30.262
Yes, you would be good
fodder for the symbiote.

13:33.052 --> 13:34.644
No! Enough, Ock!

13:36.456 --> 13:39.701
My father, my friends,
leave us all alone!

13:46.509 --> 13:48.573
This thing's as strong as the original!

13:49.315 --> 13:51.677
And toxic to the first symbiote.

13:51.702 --> 13:53.985
Behold, the Anti-Venom.

13:54.011 --> 13:57.463
Take a hint, Anti-Venom. Agent Venom
doesn't want to be your friend.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.210
It might have something
to do with your name.

13:59.235 --> 14:01.061
You won't let it have Venom?

14:01.086 --> 14:03.273
Then I'll give it something else!

14:03.989 --> 14:07.127
Every symbiote needs
a perfect bonding partner.

14:07.152 --> 14:09.678
Who better than the original host?

14:10.509 --> 14:12.882
Not again!

14:12.907 --> 14:15.418
Fight back, Harry! You're a hero now!

14:16.877 --> 14:19.081
That's right! Not gonna happen!

14:20.598 --> 14:21.401
No!

14:21.993 --> 14:24.663
Spider-Man! Help me!

14:29.570 --> 14:31.807
Harry! Harry, are you okay?

14:33.683 --> 14:35.791
Not the answer I was hoping for.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.297
Harry, stop!

14:45.033 --> 14:47.390
You've got to fight off
the Anti-Venom!

14:50.056 --> 14:51.126
Ahhh!

15:01.012 --> 15:02.982
It's going for the parent symbiote.

15:11.010 --> 15:14.629
Venom, Harry! You're both my friends!
You've gotta get control!

15:15.138 --> 15:18.182
Don't tell me! Tell him!

15:18.384 --> 15:22.408
Anti-Venom's physical being
is violently opposed to that of Venom.

15:22.433 --> 15:26.182
A perfect tool, specifically
designed to annihilate him.

15:26.207 --> 15:27.850
So he probably can't hurt me.

15:27.996 --> 15:29.230
Thanks for the tip, Ock.

15:38.637 --> 15:41.236
Okay. I guess he can
still hurt me a little.

15:45.094 --> 15:47.807
Get off my bro!

15:48.824 --> 15:51.576
Let my creations battle for supremacy.

15:51.601 --> 15:56.098
And when Anti-Venom wins,
he shall join my Sinister Six!

15:56.123 --> 15:57.551
Enough with the pestering, Ock.

15:57.576 --> 15:59.064
Can't you see I'm busy here?

16:18.066 --> 16:19.826
Venom, buddy! Talk to me!

16:20.846 --> 16:22.202
Behind you!

16:25.956 --> 16:28.155
Now am I pestering you, Spider?

16:31.753 --> 16:33.209
What about now?

16:56.857 --> 16:57.851
Ahhh!

17:00.923 --> 17:03.190
Venom, we got to get you out of here.

17:08.511 --> 17:09.511
Whoa!

17:19.435 --> 17:20.787
Oh, come on!

17:26.339 --> 17:27.281
Harry!

17:28.890 --> 17:30.177
Hold him, my pet.

17:30.223 --> 17:34.035
Spider-Man, your precious
Agent Venom is done for.

17:34.070 --> 17:36.563
Now I can dispose of you.

17:40.003 --> 17:42.653
You let me go. I knew
there was still good in...

17:43.781 --> 17:45.779
Never mind. Huh?

17:50.582 --> 17:53.288
Thanks for joining us, Norman.
And not a minute too soon.

17:53.313 --> 17:57.631
The auto-distress alarm in Patrioteer's
armor signaled a catastrophic failure.

17:57.656 --> 17:59.234
Where's my son?

17:59.259 --> 18:02.370
Uh, he's kind of inside
one of Ock's symbiotes.

18:02.386 --> 18:03.271
I'm sorry?

18:05.140 --> 18:07.785
We'll discuss this
when the situation is stable.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.596
Maybe one of Anti-Venom's
creators can pull Harry out.

18:10.621 --> 18:13.394
You keep him from hurting anyone else.
I'll get Morbius.

18:20.100 --> 18:24.427
Listen to me, son. You must try
to control it. Do you hear me?

18:28.837 --> 18:31.344
Oh, Norman. Do you see?

18:31.369 --> 18:34.489
In the end, I got your son after all.

18:35.574 --> 18:38.572
Octavius, it's always you!

18:41.840 --> 18:43.696
Hey, I just remembered
something I gotta do.

18:43.720 --> 18:44.999
Stay alive!

18:58.327 --> 18:59.619
Morbius! I'm gonna...

18:59.644 --> 19:01.111
Wait, wait, wait.
I'll tell you everything!

19:01.136 --> 19:02.720
Jeez. Let me finish the threat.

19:02.745 --> 19:04.839
The Anti-Venom can't
be stopped or altered,

19:04.864 --> 19:06.947
only inhibited in
a level 4 or 5 cadmium device

19:06.972 --> 19:08.807
with positive ion flow.
Don't hurt me!

19:08.832 --> 19:10.625
Specialized inhibitor, huh?

19:10.991 --> 19:12.533
Time to make a trip to the lab.

19:18.171 --> 19:20.758
One Anti-Venom inhibitor unit
coming right up.

19:24.568 --> 19:25.627
Ahhh!

19:26.692 --> 19:28.967
Tell me you have a way to fix this.

19:28.992 --> 19:30.990
Well, that depends on
how you define "fix."

19:31.015 --> 19:32.920
Charge this up with positive ions.

19:36.730 --> 19:37.477
Harry,

19:37.502 --> 19:40.520
you are the worst friend.

19:42.940 --> 19:45.524
I'm sorry, Harry, but this
is for your own good.

19:53.035 --> 19:55.170
- Venom?
- Spidey.

19:55.195 --> 19:59.088
Awesome bros before evil foes.

19:59.693 --> 20:01.705
Venom! Flash!

20:02.211 --> 20:03.075
Come on.

20:03.100 --> 20:05.260
We'll get you out of here.
Follow me, Norman.

20:06.886 --> 20:07.892
Harry.

20:16.899 --> 20:20.643
It wasn't my fault, sir. Spider-Man
threatened me. He's vicious.

20:20.899 --> 20:23.853
No need to apologize,
Dr. Morbius.

20:23.878 --> 20:26.281
All has fallen into place.

20:26.337 --> 20:31.274
Otto Octavius will
always be one step ahead.

20:33.892 --> 20:37.079
Agent Venom is stable, but
that's all I can do for now.

20:37.329 --> 20:39.280
It might be weeks before he'll recover.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.736
I know you'll wake up soon.

20:40.761 --> 20:44.507
My best bud wouldn't leave me hanging,
not with Doc Ock still out there.

20:48.261 --> 20:50.264
What are the odds of his recovery?

20:50.289 --> 20:53.178
We don't know.
But he has strong life signs.

20:53.278 --> 20:54.715
There's reason to hope.

20:55.992 --> 20:58.055
I'm the one that let
Harry go on the mission,

20:58.313 --> 21:00.521
after I promised to keep him safe.

21:00.853 --> 21:02.810
My two best friends are paying for it.

21:03.329 --> 21:04.364
I'll fix this.

21:04.956 --> 21:07.106
You'd better.

21:14.416 --> 21:17.414
Ugh. I've never seen
Norman that intense.

21:17.439 --> 21:19.495
And remember, he was once the Goblin.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.908
But I don't blame him for being upset.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.489
Attacking me through my friends?

21:25.313 --> 21:27.130
Not the greatest idea, Ock.

21:27.448 --> 21:29.495
The Web-Warriors
have to take you down,

21:29.956 --> 21:31.911
before it's too late.
