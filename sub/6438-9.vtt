WEBVTT

00:03.239 --> 00:05.140
You would have us march
to our end?

00:05.208 --> 00:06.608
I would have us free.

00:06.676 --> 00:08.777
With or without you

00:08.845 --> 00:11.548
I shall march upon Rome.

00:11.615 --> 00:14.083
You were slave
to Marcus Crassus himself?

00:14.151 --> 00:15.285
I was.

00:15.352 --> 00:16.786
Why would she risk all

00:16.854 --> 00:18.656
to fly from loving arms?

00:20.324 --> 00:21.892
Tomorrow we move
for Rome with Crixus.

00:21.959 --> 00:23.627
Yet I would have
you take with Spartacus.

00:23.694 --> 00:25.362
My place is forever with you.

00:25.429 --> 00:27.330
Not in this.

00:27.398 --> 00:29.278
The whore Canthara tells
of how she saw you come

00:29.334 --> 00:30.701
from Kore's tent.

00:30.768 --> 00:32.067
Game is over boy.

00:35.706 --> 00:37.172
Take it like a woman.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.309
Rome at last
lies within our grasp!

01:12.611 --> 01:15.212
One fucking hare between us?

01:18.249 --> 01:19.649
Lower voice.

01:19.717 --> 01:21.351
I do not tremble
in the dark

01:21.419 --> 01:23.820
as frightened child,

01:35.365 --> 01:37.232
Carry torch forward!

02:00.178 --> 02:02.312
Time next, you carry bow.

02:02.380 --> 02:04.114
Too far from fucking blood.

02:04.182 --> 02:05.749
Strip them of weapons and armor

02:05.817 --> 02:07.951
and what supplies
they yet carry.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.088
These men travel
from the north.

02:12.156 --> 02:14.389
What purpose would
Crassus have there?

02:16.892 --> 02:19.760
Those who follow him are
known by mark of the bull.

02:22.628 --> 02:26.062
These are not his men.

02:26.130 --> 02:28.264
The Eagle and the Dolphin.

02:31.435 --> 02:34.503
I have laid eyes
upon crest before.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.905
The mark of Gnaeus
Pompeius Magnus.

02:36.973 --> 02:38.040
Pompey?

02:38.108 --> 02:40.208
A master of both land and sea.

02:40.276 --> 02:42.844
My husband spoke with deep
admiration of the man.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.033
Bending tongue to welcome him

02:44.079 --> 02:45.079
as Rome's greatest
warrior--

02:45.146 --> 02:48.848
I have heard tale
of his conquests.

02:48.916 --> 02:50.984
And name of Adolescent
Butcher given him.

02:51.051 --> 02:53.285
We shall butcher bird and fish!

02:53.353 --> 02:54.820
I thought Pompey
mired in Hispania

02:54.888 --> 02:56.788
against the renegade Sertorius.

02:56.856 --> 02:59.323
His absence the reason Crassus
took arms against us.

02:59.391 --> 03:02.460
If Pompey's scouts
return to the Republic,

03:02.528 --> 03:04.262
as night follows day,

03:04.330 --> 03:08.232
the man and his legions
will trail their shadow.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.434
Spartacus.

03:10.502 --> 03:13.604
A rider approaches.

03:15.706 --> 03:17.941
This may hold but distraction!

03:18.008 --> 03:21.311
Give voice if eyes fall
upon movement upon flanks!

03:26.884 --> 03:29.519
They wear cloak
of the fucking legion.

03:33.891 --> 03:35.892
That is no Roman.

04:09.325 --> 04:10.492
Drink.

04:10.559 --> 04:12.427
Do not waste such on the dead.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.136
You yet live.

04:21.202 --> 04:24.940
I a but pale shade,

04:25.008 --> 04:28.110
haunting a world fallen
from meaning.

04:28.177 --> 04:31.013
Then we must nourish specter,

04:31.081 --> 04:32.715
so that it may reclaim flesh

04:32.782 --> 04:36.218
and promise of better days.

04:36.286 --> 04:38.987
There stand none upon horizon.

04:54.437 --> 04:57.640
Was his end as
he had always dreamed?

04:57.707 --> 04:59.641
In glorious battle?

04:59.709 --> 05:02.678
In battle, yes.

05:02.745 --> 05:07.149
Though robbed of glory.

05:07.217 --> 05:09.585
Tell of it.

05:09.652 --> 05:11.787
That we may share
in the burden of grief.

05:17.795 --> 05:21.532
The days after we parted were
filled with victory.

05:28.841 --> 05:31.543
The blood of our enemies
turning fields

05:31.611 --> 05:34.780
to crimson mud,
thick with the dead.

05:38.284 --> 05:40.619
Rome lay within our grasp.

05:44.424 --> 05:46.659
Only to have it snatched
from us by Crassus

05:46.727 --> 05:50.501
and his legions.

05:53.038 --> 05:55.073
It was the man himself

05:55.141 --> 06:00.212
that robbed Crixus' life?

06:00.280 --> 06:01.747
Crixus!

06:05.252 --> 06:09.155
Crixus was engaged
by the traitor Caesar.

06:09.222 --> 06:12.425
When boy of scant years

06:17.865 --> 06:20.199
pierced back with spear.

06:29.813 --> 06:33.716
A fucking boy.

06:33.784 --> 06:35.284
<i>What o Agron?</i>

06:37.354 --> 06:39.455
Does he share fate with Crixus?

06:39.523 --> 06:40.656
Or is he yet of this world?

06:55.240 --> 06:56.273
<i>There is but single reason</i>

06:56.341 --> 06:59.777
<i>Crassus spare my life.</i>

06:59.845 --> 07:03.114
To taunt Spartacus
with vision of his end.

07:13.026 --> 07:14.459
Crassus tempts
to goad you

07:14.527 --> 07:16.227
into foolish action.

07:16.295 --> 07:19.431
If I stood only
for my own life,

07:19.498 --> 07:22.133
perhaps I would stand so moved.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.435
Yet we must turn
from such thoughts,

07:24.503 --> 07:27.371
and set purpose towards
more pressing concern.

07:27.439 --> 07:28.773
Pompey.

07:28.841 --> 07:31.243
His scouts were headed south,
towards Crassus' legions.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.879
He will send more,
when they do not return.

07:33.947 --> 07:36.315
We cannot afford to be caught
between two armies,

07:36.383 --> 07:37.550
fighting as one.

07:37.617 --> 07:40.152
No. We cannot.

07:45.324 --> 07:47.693
None among the Gaul's men
form words of note?

07:47.760 --> 07:49.194
We have set lash
and heated iron

07:49.262 --> 07:50.896
towards the loosening
of tongues.

07:50.963 --> 07:53.966
I shall press until one
unmoors from stubborn tether.

07:54.033 --> 07:55.468
Or command all torn
from rebellious root.

07:55.535 --> 07:56.602
I have time nor
patience to pause

07:56.670 --> 07:58.905
for such distraction.

07:58.973 --> 08:00.006
Give word to break encampment

08:00.073 --> 08:02.108
as Apollo approaches
eastern sky.

08:02.176 --> 08:03.676
I would quicken pace.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.511
There is a matter
of some small concern

08:05.579 --> 08:07.480
within the followers' camp.

08:07.548 --> 08:09.215
A whore
by the name of Canthara,

08:09.283 --> 08:11.251
discovered beaten
and slitas pig

08:11.318 --> 08:12.986
from womanhood to throat.

08:14.722 --> 08:17.790
Canthara? What do you
know of this, Caesar?

08:17.858 --> 08:21.126
News only now falls upon ear.

08:21.194 --> 08:23.128
I have been seeking the woman
for several days.

08:23.196 --> 08:26.165
Whoever she angered, his wrath
is a thing to be feared.

08:26.232 --> 08:27.699
<i>Followers' camp</i>
<i>is but brief step</i>

08:27.767 --> 08:29.034
from our very ranks.

08:29.102 --> 08:31.904
I would not have it
fall to chaos and murder.

08:31.971 --> 08:33.772
I shall personally
attend to matter.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.376
May those responsible
suffer equal fate.

08:37.443 --> 08:38.544
Imperator.

08:38.611 --> 08:40.480
Two soldiers approach
on horseback,

08:40.548 --> 08:43.515
bearing crest of Pompey.

08:43.583 --> 08:47.454
The butcher at
last reveals himself.

08:47.521 --> 08:49.255
See them to my praetorium.

08:55.596 --> 08:57.697
Proconsul Gnaeu
Pompeius Magnus...

08:57.764 --> 08:59.165
...offers support in campaign

08:59.233 --> 09:00.733
against the rebel Spartacus.

09:04.405 --> 09:06.873
Offer greeted with
wondrous surprise.

09:06.941 --> 09:08.074
I've never known Pompey

09:08.142 --> 09:10.810
to support any cause
but his own interests.

09:10.878 --> 09:11.811
Apologies.

09:11.879 --> 09:13.480
I but carry message.

09:13.548 --> 09:15.582
Hmmm, see remainder fall
from tongue.

09:15.650 --> 09:18.985
Pompey requests meeting.

09:19.053 --> 09:21.321
Why does he not appear
before us himself,

09:21.388 --> 09:23.223
if taken by such desire?

09:23.291 --> 09:25.792
Because he does
not stand the fool.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.627
Does he?

09:27.695 --> 09:30.830
I will not risk journey.

09:30.898 --> 09:33.733
Nor will I break from
my charge to bow and scrap

09:33.801 --> 09:35.969
before imagined titan.

09:36.037 --> 09:39.039
Pompey seeks
but neutral ground.

09:39.107 --> 09:41.975
Twenty men attending him,
to be met in kind.

09:47.949 --> 09:50.518
I will consider terms.

09:50.586 --> 09:52.019
See them to food and wine.

09:52.087 --> 09:53.654
Imperator.

09:57.926 --> 10:00.561
You cannot seriously be
turning offer upon mind?

10:00.628 --> 10:02.162
Pompey but seeks your
knowledge of Spartacus

10:02.230 --> 10:05.432
so that he may snatch victory
from deserving hands.

10:05.500 --> 10:09.603
Caesar, you agree, do you not?

10:09.671 --> 10:11.639
I share your concerns.

10:11.706 --> 10:14.842
Yet Pompey returns the hero
against Sertorius,

10:14.910 --> 10:16.177
ripe with laurels.

10:16.245 --> 10:19.147
To refuse offer would be
considered insult.

10:19.215 --> 10:22.450
One that could be set against
you within the Senate.

10:22.518 --> 10:23.584
To shit with the Senate.

10:23.652 --> 10:25.920
There is practical
reason as well

10:25.988 --> 10:27.322
to accept terms.

10:29.725 --> 10:32.059
We could press attack
from the south,

10:32.127 --> 10:33.360
Pompey could stay Spartacus

10:33.428 --> 10:35.996
from gaining the mountains
and slipping from grasp.

10:36.063 --> 10:38.198
With all who follow him.

10:40.568 --> 10:42.202
A thing I would not see
come to pass.

10:42.270 --> 10:44.404
Father, you cannot go.

10:44.472 --> 10:45.705
It would appear
Pompey commands you.

10:45.773 --> 10:48.108
Again, I share concern.

10:48.176 --> 10:50.544
You should give no impression
that you are beneath him.

10:50.612 --> 10:53.147
Instead send honored
name in your place

10:53.215 --> 10:54.548
to broach negotiation.

10:54.616 --> 10:57.285
And I suppose such name holds
letters forming "Caesar"?

10:57.352 --> 10:59.620
No. Only
the Imperator's Word

10:59.688 --> 11:03.557
and Will holds such
lofty position.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.526
Pompey stands shrewd opponent.

11:05.593 --> 11:07.160
I would have one
of more seasoned years

11:07.228 --> 11:08.728
to set against him.

11:08.796 --> 11:11.931
Tiberius has proven himself
worthy advisory.

11:11.999 --> 11:14.968
His youth will but cause
Pompey to lower his guard,

11:15.036 --> 11:18.338
to deepest regret.

11:18.406 --> 11:24.812
Caesar at last breaks words
that I am moved to embrace.

11:24.879 --> 11:28.215
We shall pause advance
until your return.

11:28.283 --> 11:31.318
Weigh Pompey's true intent yet
give upon no issue.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.654
I shall stand as my father,

11:33.721 --> 11:35.522
unforgiving in command.

11:40.862 --> 11:45.399
Was it so short a span,
when he stood uncertain boy?

11:45.467 --> 11:48.235
Such days have
faded from memory.

11:48.303 --> 11:51.272
He stands a man now.

11:51.339 --> 11:53.820
And I wish for him
all that he deserves.

12:17.132 --> 12:19.067
You were slave
to Marcus Crassus?

12:22.238 --> 12:27.142
The one that slipped
from him upon Melia Ridge?

12:27.210 --> 12:28.610
I have heard rumor.

12:28.678 --> 12:32.114
That he was of a favor
towards you.

12:32.181 --> 12:34.483
There stood such a time.

12:34.551 --> 12:37.920
Then you were of a
closeness to him.

12:37.988 --> 12:39.589
Before you fled.

12:39.657 --> 12:42.993
I shared his tent that night.

12:43.060 --> 12:47.464
I took knife and slipped from
presence while he slept.

12:47.531 --> 12:51.968
Why did you not
seize opportunity?

12:52.036 --> 12:53.636
And end his life?

12:55.473 --> 12:59.175
If Crassus had
fallen that night,

12:59.243 --> 13:04.080
Then Crixus would
yet be of this world.

13:04.148 --> 13:06.349
I am moved by your loss.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.351
Yet I cannot be held for it.

13:08.419 --> 13:11.754
We are all held
for our actions.

13:11.822 --> 13:13.723
The choices we make.

13:13.790 --> 13:17.293
The things that we do.

13:17.361 --> 13:20.095
And those that we should have.

13:20.163 --> 13:22.864
We cannot reverse the sun.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.599
Nor relive days past.

13:24.667 --> 13:30.472
No. We can but brace
against uncertain future.

13:33.476 --> 13:36.846
And when moment presents,

13:36.913 --> 13:39.181
balance scale against those

13:39.249 --> 13:41.850
who have most deeply
wounded heart.

14:12.415 --> 14:14.182
Inform Pompey of my arrival.

14:29.332 --> 14:31.600
Stay at my side.

14:31.668 --> 14:35.604
If the man makes but slightest
move, unleash sword.

14:35.672 --> 14:37.539
Let us break words
with your commander.

14:37.607 --> 14:39.908
And divine his intent.

14:39.976 --> 14:42.277
He stands most eager
to greet you.

14:50.052 --> 14:52.754
Honored Pompey.
My father sends regret

14:52.822 --> 14:53.755
that he could not --

14:53.823 --> 14:54.890
The regret is mine.

15:00.363 --> 15:03.699
I had hoped to embrace
the Imperator himself.

15:03.766 --> 15:06.868
Yet fate delivers mere shadow
of the name Crassus.

15:33.227 --> 15:36.430
Is this the blade?

15:36.498 --> 15:42.235
The one that robbed
Crixus of his life?

15:42.303 --> 15:46.172
See the boy's men bound
and readied for march.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.208
<i>Get up!</i>

15:48.275 --> 15:50.577
You would keep them alive?

15:50.645 --> 15:53.213
I would see them give
honor to the dead.

15:53.281 --> 15:56.148
In advance of
joining their ranks.

16:06.493 --> 16:08.694
You will have no need of that.

16:08.762 --> 16:13.399
I had no hand
in Canthara's fate.

16:13.467 --> 16:17.203
The one who commanded
her so rudely from this world

16:17.271 --> 16:19.505
will never again cause harm.

16:19.573 --> 16:24.510
<i>You know the animal</i>
<i>that took her life?</i>

16:24.578 --> 16:26.913
A bleating sheep
who mistook himself

16:26.981 --> 16:29.649
as fearsome wolf.

16:29.717 --> 16:31.518
Maneuvered towards
deserved slaughter.

16:33.754 --> 16:35.621
<i>I would give all</i>
<i>to lay eyes upon</i>

16:35.689 --> 16:42.261
his suffering.

16:42.328 --> 16:45.831
Let us take comfort
in thoughts of blood.

16:45.898 --> 16:49.467
And the warmth of flesh,
yet among the living...

17:47.760 --> 17:49.094
What of Crassus?

17:49.161 --> 17:51.396
Plan to lure him to his
doom falls short of mark.

17:57.771 --> 17:59.004
Stay your hand!

18:02.909 --> 18:05.611
I would not have the boy and his
men fall to errant wrath!

18:07.647 --> 18:11.317
Their blood is to serve
higher purpose!

18:13.687 --> 18:14.820
Games?

18:14.888 --> 18:16.789
To honor the fallen.

18:16.857 --> 18:19.725
And give comfort to those
left in death's wake.

18:30.003 --> 18:32.405
I have seen this before.

18:32.472 --> 18:38.945
In Crixus' hands. And the boy's
upon field of battle as it...

18:39.013 --> 18:45.618
His name is Tiberius.
He is the son of Marcus Crassus.

18:45.686 --> 18:48.655
He stands prisoner with
a clutch of his soldiers.

18:58.867 --> 19:00.901
I will have his fucking life.

19:00.969 --> 19:04.705
The reason he yet clings to it.

19:04.773 --> 19:08.510
Let us build pyre and gather
around imagined sands

19:08.578 --> 19:11.247
of storied arena.

19:11.314 --> 19:15.385
To bear solemn witness to
the clash of sword and shield.

19:19.223 --> 19:25.027
And pay final tribute
to the Undefeated Gaul.

19:25.095 --> 19:31.100
Who shall forever stand
so in my eyes.

19:31.168 --> 19:37.407
There was a time not along
ago when he turned from you.

19:37.475 --> 19:39.609
A thing I moved him towards.

19:39.677 --> 19:43.313
The past is seldom
as we would have it.

19:43.381 --> 19:47.284
The future yet to be known.

19:47.352 --> 19:50.287
Embrace the present,

19:50.355 --> 19:53.157
and strike all
else from concern.

20:02.167 --> 20:05.837
Let us have your games.

20:05.905 --> 20:10.809
Each drop of Roman
blood spilled in honor

20:10.876 --> 20:14.812
of those taken from us.

20:17.115 --> 20:19.796
<i>Die Roman dog!</i>

20:39.639 --> 20:45.244
I know this one.

20:45.311 --> 20:48.982
Agron. From the lands
east of the Rhine.

20:49.049 --> 20:51.017
A savage people,
holding no trust

20:51.085 --> 20:52.485
even among their own kind.

20:52.553 --> 20:54.320
<i>This one is of a difference.</i>

20:54.388 --> 20:56.356
A gladiator standing
beside Spartacus

20:56.424 --> 20:58.124
in valued position,

20:58.192 --> 21:00.860
the Celt Gannicus
and the fallen Gaul

21:00.928 --> 21:02.229
his only equals.

21:02.297 --> 21:04.031
Has he given voice?

21:04.099 --> 21:05.699
Only to rude curse, Imperator.

21:05.767 --> 21:08.101
There is yet more upon tongue,

21:08.169 --> 21:10.203
you fucking cunts...

21:11.773 --> 21:13.941
More dead than living,

21:14.008 --> 21:16.810
yet still conjures
breath toward insult.

21:16.878 --> 21:19.479
I would care to
own gladiators such as this,

21:19.547 --> 21:23.850
and turn hard men toward harder
purpose.

21:23.918 --> 21:28.588
As I would see
this one softened.

21:28.656 --> 21:31.057
Nail him to cross...

21:31.125 --> 21:32.726
...stand warning
to all who refuse

21:32.793 --> 21:36.397
to break proper word.

21:43.672 --> 21:45.807
I shall yet... have
your fucking head.

21:54.316 --> 21:56.417
An impressive feat,

21:56.485 --> 21:59.453
For one who will never
again grasp sword...

22:50.771 --> 22:52.238
Would that all
who follow Spartacus

22:52.306 --> 22:54.374
shared like fate.

22:58.112 --> 22:59.646
<i>Imperator.</i>

22:59.714 --> 23:02.849
An envoy from Pompey
has arrived.

23:02.917 --> 23:04.785
What of Tiberius?

23:04.852 --> 23:06.553
He does not stand among them.

23:08.222 --> 23:10.223
Imperator Crassus.

23:10.291 --> 23:11.991
I carry message
from Proconsul Pompeius--

23:12.059 --> 23:14.293
Where is my son?

23:14.361 --> 23:15.528
Your son...?

23:15.596 --> 23:17.076
Dispatched with two
of your reflection

23:17.131 --> 23:19.132
to break word with
your commander.

23:19.199 --> 23:22.035
Apologies,
I know nothing of your son,

23:22.102 --> 23:24.471
nor others sent to you
in my place.

23:24.538 --> 23:25.872
I am sole envoy--

23:25.940 --> 23:28.341
They stood before me bearing
fucking mark of Pompey!

23:28.409 --> 23:29.775
Other messengers
were dispatched.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.444
Yet not to you.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.617
Have any failed to report?

23:38.685 --> 23:41.754
A clutch of men, heading
south towards Latium.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.430
Leave us.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.700
They were Spartacus' men,
posing as Pompey's.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.168
You can not know this --

23:56.236 --> 23:59.838
You should have! You stood
among the rebels in Sinuessa!

23:59.906 --> 24:02.707
There were thousands
within the city.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.409
Fortune would be most kind
for me to know

24:04.477 --> 24:05.811
the one that presented himself.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.046
Gods rain shit upon us.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.151
Yet is it not blessing,
that they stayed you

24:13.219 --> 24:16.155
from being ensnared
in clever plot?

24:16.222 --> 24:17.757
If the Imperator were
to fall to Spartacus --

24:17.824 --> 24:20.693
We do not know that
Tiberius has fallen.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.295
He carries the name of Crassus.

24:23.363 --> 24:29.033
And with him the worth
of the world towards bargain.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.234
You believe him alive?

24:30.302 --> 24:31.602
As any father would,

24:31.670 --> 24:36.673
absent eyes laid upon
lifeless form.

24:36.741 --> 24:39.108
Then we must pray
towards proper outcome,

24:39.176 --> 24:40.497
and wait for Spartacus
to return--

24:40.511 --> 24:42.512
I will not stand idle
while my son's life

24:42.580 --> 24:44.614
dangles by fraying thread.

24:48.685 --> 24:51.321
We know which direction
Spartacus heads.

24:51.388 --> 24:52.956
A few men fleet upon horse
could overtake him

24:53.023 --> 24:54.057
and broach trade.

24:54.125 --> 24:56.326
Spartacus will kill
you upon sight,

24:56.394 --> 24:57.928
regardless of cost.

25:01.399 --> 25:04.067
I shall set Rufus towards task.

25:05.402 --> 25:06.636
I would place trust in someone

25:06.703 --> 25:09.772
with greater knowledge
of Spartacus and his horde.

25:12.843 --> 25:15.144
Someone who's lived among them,

25:15.211 --> 25:18.046
and knows of their
treacherous ways.

25:22.752 --> 25:24.353
You would send me to my death.

25:24.420 --> 25:26.888
They will not lay hand
upon you.

25:26.956 --> 25:29.624
We hold something I'm certain
Spartacus desires.

25:29.692 --> 25:30.759
And if you are in error?

25:32.028 --> 25:34.662
Then I shall mourn your passing
as well.

25:50.948 --> 25:53.650
Fucking shits.

25:53.717 --> 25:55.686
I hold share of blame.

25:55.753 --> 26:00.924
I latched upon bait lured with
praise and paternal pride.

26:00.992 --> 26:04.194
He must have known they
stood Spartacus' men,

26:04.262 --> 26:06.497
draped in false mantle.

26:07.966 --> 26:10.569
Do not raise weapon
when called upon.

26:10.636 --> 26:13.805
We will not give
entertainment in our deaths.

26:13.873 --> 26:16.342
Remember that we are Romans,

26:16.409 --> 26:18.944
and they nothing but slaves.

26:19.012 --> 26:21.046
<i>Yet you are the one in chains.</i>

26:22.315 --> 26:24.750
A heavy thing, is it not?

26:24.818 --> 26:27.252
To be so condemned
to the whims of a master?

26:29.189 --> 26:30.789
You were never
placed in chains.

26:30.857 --> 26:33.692
You forged them
with your own hands.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.362
Each unseen link binding heart

26:36.429 --> 26:39.465
forcing me from the arms
of your father.

26:39.533 --> 26:41.000
See me from these chains,

26:41.068 --> 26:42.835
and I shall return you to them.

26:42.903 --> 26:45.971
His heart still beats
for you, Kore.

26:46.039 --> 26:50.543
Despite all that has happened.

26:50.611 --> 26:52.812
He still hold love for me?

26:52.880 --> 26:57.483
And would move
the heavens to regain you.

26:57.550 --> 27:03.021
I have not dared to hope
such a thing.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.691
Gratitude.

27:12.098 --> 27:15.868
Know that I shall
return at night fall.

27:15.936 --> 27:18.671
When it is your time to die.

27:18.739 --> 27:21.641
A thing I long
to lay eyes upon.

28:56.303 --> 29:01.307
It's been a lifetime
since I last stood gladiator.

29:01.375 --> 29:06.380
Title and purpose
I never desired.

29:06.447 --> 29:13.154
Rome forced such upon me
and many of my brothers.

29:13.221 --> 29:14.655
And this night...

29:14.723 --> 29:17.425
we shall return favor!

29:22.932 --> 29:26.802
Let us show the son
of Crassus and his men

29:26.870 --> 29:29.371
what we have learned
beneath the heel

29:29.439 --> 29:33.343
of their mighty Republic.

29:33.410 --> 29:35.745
And in such lesson,

29:35.813 --> 29:37.814
honor the dead

29:37.881 --> 29:39.916
with Roman blood!

30:15.285 --> 30:18.387
I would know
what challenge you present.

30:18.455 --> 30:22.324
Absent legions to give aid,

30:22.392 --> 30:26.461
as they did against
Crixus and Agron.

30:35.071 --> 30:36.338
Begin!

30:48.484 --> 30:50.118
I am a Roman!

30:54.457 --> 30:58.341
I will not fight for your
fucking entertainment --

31:09.139 --> 31:14.076
You will fight,
or fall where you stand!

31:16.746 --> 31:19.081
If a single Roman lacks
courage enough to face me...

31:19.149 --> 31:21.116
send two to brace nerve!

32:22.610 --> 32:25.011
I have never laid eyes
upon the games.

32:28.049 --> 32:33.387
They are but dim reflection
of their glory.

32:33.455 --> 32:36.124
You speak as if heart
yearns for such days.

32:45.668 --> 32:48.837
To return to shackle
and lash, no.

32:48.905 --> 32:50.806
<i>To stand upon</i>
<i>the sands again...</i>

32:54.144 --> 32:56.345
<i>To know a clear</i>
<i>purpose of who you</i>

32:56.412 --> 33:02.518
<i>are and what must be done...</i>

33:02.585 --> 33:05.187
That is a thing that calls
to all of my kind.

35:23.291 --> 35:24.859
I would have more blood,

35:24.927 --> 35:26.761
to honor my brother Crixus

35:26.829 --> 35:29.831
and all who have followed him
to the afterlife!

35:31.067 --> 35:32.300
Gannicus!

35:32.368 --> 35:33.969
Take position!

35:36.272 --> 35:39.208
Two Romans seem to
deliver no contest!

35:41.212 --> 35:46.616
Send three, so that I may
deliver proper tribute!

36:02.033 --> 36:03.500
<i>Gannicus seeks to best you?</i>

36:03.568 --> 36:06.403
Gladiators seek to best all.

36:06.470 --> 36:08.150
It is the only way
to survive in the arena.

36:31.260 --> 36:34.028
Gannicus stands
the only among us

36:34.096 --> 36:36.764
to win his freedom
upon the sands.

36:39.502 --> 36:41.343
If free, why does he raise
arms with the slaves

36:41.404 --> 36:43.205
against the Republic?

36:46.309 --> 36:49.745
He took up cause
to honor a fallen brother.

36:49.813 --> 36:52.515
One that taught us
the ways of battle

36:52.582 --> 36:55.451
and the bond that joins
all men in such pursuit.

37:13.571 --> 37:15.305
It holds difficulty?

37:15.372 --> 37:17.874
To see one of your people fall?

37:22.947 --> 37:28.051
They no longer stand as such.

37:28.119 --> 37:30.287
I have been cast
from the Republic,

37:30.354 --> 37:33.824
thought towards loss
or suffering.

37:33.891 --> 37:38.095
I may flinch from gory sight...

37:38.162 --> 37:41.498
...yet know that I revel
in its meaning.

38:52.335 --> 38:54.836
Would that you stood
a thousand men.

38:54.904 --> 38:57.739
Your deaths by my hand worthy
of Agron's memory.

39:17.194 --> 39:19.161
You stand prepared
for final contest?

39:20.897 --> 39:24.867
Crixus once boasted
of his prowess as a gladiator,

39:24.935 --> 39:27.404
in first words he ever
broke with me.

39:27.471 --> 39:31.708
I said I did not favor
the games...

39:31.776 --> 39:33.743
Now they are
all that I long for.

39:35.580 --> 39:37.147
You're certain that's him?

39:39.417 --> 39:41.418
Do not lower guard.

39:46.557 --> 39:48.191
Who do you speak of?

39:48.258 --> 39:50.359
One I long to greet.

40:00.436 --> 40:04.173
I offer fair trade!
Five hundred of your men

40:04.240 --> 40:08.845
taken in battle against Crixus
for Tiberius' life --

40:09.580 --> 40:11.281
Hold!

40:11.349 --> 40:15.753
I would hear of this--

40:15.820 --> 40:17.221
He lives then?

40:17.289 --> 40:18.289
The boy?

40:18.357 --> 40:21.259
Perhaps. For yet a moment.

40:21.326 --> 40:23.828
Tell me you do not fall prey
to this viper's tongue?

40:23.896 --> 40:26.498
The words they form
are not my own.

40:26.566 --> 40:29.701
Do not think me
the fool to greet you

40:29.769 --> 40:32.738
with willful fucking intent.

40:32.806 --> 40:34.773
Crassus would offer
such a bargain?

40:34.841 --> 40:37.276
He would offer Jupiter's
throne in return

40:37.343 --> 40:41.213
for festering disease that
sprung from noble loins.

40:41.281 --> 40:43.015
He but attempts to draw
us into another plot

40:43.082 --> 40:44.382
turning upon itself.

40:44.450 --> 40:45.484
He attempts nothing!

40:45.551 --> 40:46.985
The man is of singular mind.

40:47.053 --> 40:48.921
One I do not fucking share,

40:53.126 --> 40:54.627
Five hundred?

40:54.695 --> 41:00.500
Take my life as
I know you desire...

41:00.567 --> 41:03.035
And end theirs as well.

41:13.880 --> 41:21.252
Fuck the gods.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.954
You honored Agron well.

41:23.022 --> 41:25.023
As you shall honor Crixus.

41:45.479 --> 41:47.714
For you!

42:12.975 --> 42:17.580
I would have my sword
returned to me, slave.

42:17.647 --> 42:20.183
You claim the sword
as your own?

42:24.087 --> 42:25.855
The way it fits hand,

42:25.923 --> 42:32.495
I thought it forged for
woman or sickly child.

42:59.723 --> 43:02.558
Do you yet consider me
sickly child?

43:10.968 --> 43:14.170
I find you more than expected.

43:52.744 --> 43:57.448
Gratitude. I held worries
you would die to quickly.

44:03.890 --> 44:08.126
I will have your life...

44:08.194 --> 44:10.996
As I took
the fucking Gaul's --

44:56.706 --> 45:00.843
I would see blade
returned to you now.

45:09.720 --> 45:12.923
<i>Naevia!</i>

45:21.067 --> 45:22.567
Take pause.

45:29.075 --> 45:31.810
Crassus offers trade!

45:31.878 --> 45:33.979
His son's life for five hundred

45:34.047 --> 45:38.283
captured in battle with Crixus!

45:47.426 --> 45:52.196
Another Roman lie!

45:52.263 --> 45:58.135
I do not believe it so.

45:58.202 --> 46:02.572
Yet I lay choice with the one
most wronged by the boy.

46:47.550 --> 46:51.019
I held your life in my hands.

46:51.087 --> 46:56.659
Live each moment
knowing that one day soon

46:56.727 --> 46:58.928
I shall reclaim it.

47:16.847 --> 47:20.182
<i>Kill them!</i>
<i>Fucking kill him!</i>

47:22.018 --> 47:24.132
Fucking kill him!

47:36.200 --> 47:38.901
Delivered into hands,
as agreed upon.

47:38.969 --> 47:41.136
I would break words.

47:41.204 --> 47:43.605
He has been too long
from embrace.

47:54.451 --> 47:57.120
It lifts heart.
To see you yet of this world.

47:57.187 --> 47:59.722
Do not ply me
with silver tongue.

47:59.789 --> 48:00.989
You knew them
to be Spartacus' men,

48:01.057 --> 48:03.426
under guise of Pompey's.

48:03.493 --> 48:04.694
A bold claim.

48:04.761 --> 48:07.963
Well one my father will
surely take interest in.

48:08.031 --> 48:12.635
The journey to return you to his
arms is fraught with peril.

48:12.703 --> 48:14.504
For one needing to be
taught severest lesson

48:14.571 --> 48:18.775
in who towers above you...

48:28.486 --> 48:31.122
No!

48:58.718 --> 49:01.553
You mad bitch.
Do you know what you have done?

49:01.620 --> 49:08.092
I have balanced fucking scale.

49:08.160 --> 49:11.629
Five hundred of our people
will suffer for this.

49:11.697 --> 49:13.431
The boy holds no value now.

49:13.499 --> 49:15.099
Nor does life of Caesar.

49:15.167 --> 49:21.205
Wait! Crassus will
yet honor trade!

49:21.273 --> 49:24.642
If you give him something
else his heart desires.

49:40.660 --> 49:44.964
He was struck down
by hand of rebel slave,

49:45.031 --> 49:49.769
as we attempted to withdraw
from Spartacus' camp.

49:49.837 --> 49:53.273
A man long of years,
the scars of his master

49:53.341 --> 49:57.010
etched deep upon flesh.

49:57.078 --> 50:01.382
And yet you held
to fucking bargain?

50:01.450 --> 50:04.285
I knew wound
such loss would cause.

50:04.352 --> 50:07.525
I sought only to balm it with
opportunity presented...

50:18.233 --> 50:21.668
Gratitude, Gaius.

50:21.736 --> 50:24.305
You now stand
my Word and my Will.

50:24.372 --> 50:25.806
You honor me.

50:25.874 --> 50:29.177
Prepare the men for march.

50:29.245 --> 50:33.182
I would press towards Spartacus

50:33.250 --> 50:36.852
and see him to deserved end.

50:36.920 --> 50:38.954
Imperator.

51:05.682 --> 51:06.749
Raise eyes.

51:12.055 --> 51:14.457
Marcus--

51:21.398 --> 51:29.072
From this day forth...
you shall address me as Dominus.

51:51.997 --> 51:58.570
Would that those we held
to heart stood among them.

51:58.637 --> 52:00.171
Nasir...

52:26.098 --> 52:28.533
The gods return you to my arms.

52:28.601 --> 52:31.068
I was fool to ever leave them.

53:25.023 --> 53:28.792
This night hearts lift
in joyous reunion

53:28.860 --> 53:32.829
with those thought lost to us.

53:32.897 --> 53:35.699
Fathers.

53:35.766 --> 53:39.136
<i>Brothers and sisters.</i>

53:39.203 --> 53:44.308
Sons and lovers.

53:44.375 --> 53:48.878
Hold them close for
the shadow of Rome is upon us.

53:48.946 --> 53:52.015
We hall seek our
destiny together.

53:52.083 --> 53:57.221
Whatever the cost.

53:57.289 --> 53:59.557
Yet let us not pass from memory

53:59.625 --> 54:03.127
those left
absent from our arms.

54:03.195 --> 54:05.864
Those who sacrificed
their lives

54:05.932 --> 54:08.867
so that all may live free.

54:24.050 --> 54:25.984
For Crixus!

54:49.776 --> 54:52.044
For Sura.

54:52.112 --> 54:56.381
For Varro and Mira!

54:56.449 --> 54:59.418
For Oenomaus!

54:59.486 --> 55:01.153
For Diotimus!

55:01.221 --> 55:03.689
For Rhaskos.

55:03.757 --> 55:06.057
<i>For Sanus!</i>

55:06.125 --> 55:07.793
Donar!

55:07.861 --> 55:09.362
For Duro!

55:09.429 --> 55:10.796
For Aca.

55:10.864 --> 55:12.264
<i>Fortis!</i>

55:12.332 --> 55:13.531
<i>Varca!</i>

55:13.599 --> 55:15.166
Nemetes!

55:15.234 --> 55:16.701
Liscus!

55:21.540 --> 55:25.643
<i>For Crixus!</i>
<i>Crixus! Crixus...</i>

55:43.127 --> 55:45.662
Split heavens
with the sound of his name!

55:48.366 --> 55:51.601
Let it carry
to Crassus and Pompey

55:51.669 --> 55:56.139
as distant thunder promising
storm and blood!

55:56.207 --> 55:58.308
<i>All those who are able</i>

55:58.376 --> 56:02.446
<i>shall make final</i>
<i>stand against Rome.</i>

56:02.513 --> 56:04.648
And this I promise you.

56:08.520 --> 56:11.589
We will live free...

56:11.656 --> 56:14.458
or join our brothers in death!
