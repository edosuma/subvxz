07:23.860 --> 07:25.362
Just a question.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.371
What would you pay a guy?

07:28.907 --> 07:31.251
Cora, how much we pay last guy?

Well, okay. If we still got it.

And, uh, ahem, I'll send you some
money in any case, for the breakfast.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.416

09:02.500 --> 09:05.299
Here's change, 20 cents.
Thank you very much.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.465
What you need is more coverage.

09:08.631 --> 09:12.602
- Ah, I had it last year.
- No, you had fire, theft, no liability.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.981
- So, what I need it now for?
- You should have had it then.

09:16.139 --> 09:19.234
Suppose a customer comes in here
and there's grease on the floor?

09:19.434 --> 09:21.257
No, sorry,
there's no grease on the floor.

09:21.283 --> 09:22.554

09:22.687 --> 09:25.987
No. You suppose something else.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.153

09:35.533 --> 09:39.288

- I come looking for some hand soap.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.048
I don't have any hand soap here.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.130
You got anything in the kitchen
I could use?

09:45.293 --> 09:47.671
Go use the station john.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.515
I'd just get it dirty.

09:56.137 --> 09:59.266
I'll tell him to get you some
next time he goes in.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.986
Sorry to bother you.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.154
You want a cup of coffee?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.079

10:37.303 --> 10:39.601
What, do I look Greek to you?

10:41.808 --> 10:43.060
No.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.071
Thanks.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.912
So, uh...

10:56.614 --> 10:57.911
...what do I call you?

11:02.871 --> 11:05.215
I guess you can call me Cora.

11:07.458 --> 11:11.884
Every man need to have home.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.851
You travel, huh?

11:27.395 --> 11:29.773
The time come...

11:32.483 --> 11:35.362

11:38.781 --> 11:43.582

11:43.828 --> 11:48.459

You know what that is?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.671
What?

12:30.833 --> 12:33.302
You know what it means, that?

12:35.129 --> 12:36.506
No.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.938
You know, you never make fun
a man talk funny.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.020
I talk English better

12:49.102 --> 12:51.946
You know, Frank, this a country...

13:09.706 --> 13:12.710
But there is no happiness.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.907
Nick, it's late.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.869
Frank! Frank, come here!
Hurry up, quick!

14:47.512 --> 14:49.514
Push, push, push.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.777
You know what I'd do, Nick?

15:00.149 --> 15:01.241

Oh, I'm get new one. Sure. That son

15:05.405 --> 15:08.454
Neon. Something flashy.
You know what I mean?

15:08.699 --> 15:11.327
- Bring some business in.
- Neon? What's a neon?

15:11.494 --> 15:15.169
Huh? Neon. You know, uh...

16:01.502 --> 16:03.004
He didn't tell me.

16:03.171 --> 16:06.345
He said he was going into town
to get some parts.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.889
Smells good in here today.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.817
Is that door locked?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.904
Mm. I must have locked it.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.377
That's money down the
drain, isn't it?

16:40.166 --> 16:43.796
I suppose you could look at it
that way if you wanted to.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.600
It's not your money either, is it?

16:50.510 --> 16:51.762
No.

17:07.734 --> 17:08.906
Open it.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.493
Did you hear me?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.029
Wait a minute.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.783
Wait, get off. Wait.

Let's see it.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.601

21:49.767 --> 21:51.940

Okay.

22:06.909 --> 22:08.627
Shh.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.626
How'd you get that way?

22:54.748 --> 22:57.251
How are you feeling tonight, Cora?

22:58.002 --> 22:59.675
Lousy.

23:13.017 --> 23:15.145
Yeah, you missed me.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.739
Cora!

24:04.234 --> 24:07.488
Stupid, stupid. I almost forgot.

24:09.990 --> 24:11.537
My design, huh?

24:12.660 --> 24:15.209
I see they make it the way I say.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.669
See you tomorrow, huh?

24:21.627 --> 24:23.345
See you later, Nick!

24:43.148 --> 24:44.650
Yeah?

24:57.579 --> 24:59.456
Feel like doing something?

25:02.001 --> 25:03.253

Do you want some company?

25:36.827 --> 25:38.955

Go pack a bag.
We're going to Chicago.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.411
Go pack a bag.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.747
We're going to Chicago. Now.

Put your purse away.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.781
Wait a minute.
You left your suitcase.

26:55.948 --> 27:00.704
<i>Bus leaving from

28:36.506 --> 28:37.803
Come on.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.556
No, I'm not giving it to you.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.938
Hey, what? No, no.
You don't understand.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.148
I gotta cover a bet.
I can't talk to you now.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.360
- Frank, I can't go out there broke.
- What?

28:49.311 --> 28:51.689
What are you doing
out there anyway?

28:52.481 --> 28:55.530
Will you, for chrissake,
just give me some money?

29:03.158 --> 29:05.252
I saved that money.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.725
Two for San Francisco.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.643
- What are you doing?
- I'm trading these in.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.232
- San Francisco.
- We're going to Chicago.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.772
- Not anymore. You wanna give me money?
- No.

29:30.018 --> 29:33.397
- That's $37 change for you folks.
- I appreciate that.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.691
Wait, you told me your friends
were in Chicago.

29:35.857 --> 29:40.158
Hey. Hey. I got friends in Chicago.
I got friends in Duluth.

29:40.654 --> 29:43.828
I'm gonna show you something.
Sit down.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.877
Sit down.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.613
You got it. You got it.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.701
Oh, I must have skipped you.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.116
- You destroyed me.
- I sure got lucky.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.870
Wait a minute.
You're leaving with the money?

30:25.824 --> 30:26.871
Well, I won it.

30:27.075 --> 30:30.079
Hey, mate.
I want a shot to get it back.

30:30.912 --> 30:33.085
Fuck you, commodore.
I'm taking it.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.921
I won this money.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.219
All right?

30:41.089 --> 30:43.137
It's all right with me, pal.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.020
Good meeting with you.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.849
Let's go, Jim. Come on.

30:59.066 --> 31:03.572
Hey, did you see that good-looking girl
I was talking to leave with anyone?

31:03.820 --> 31:05.868
No, I don't know where she went.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.231
Turn it on.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.772
We shouldn't have
hooked this up in the rain.

31:37.938 --> 31:39.485
Finish up already!

31:39.648 --> 31:41.742
- You check the connection?
- I checked it.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.493
- You check the switch?
- I did.

31:43.652 --> 31:44.824
Check the hookup.

31:44.986 --> 31:48.661
You both say sign work day and night.
I want lights on.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.872
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Turn them on!

31:51.118 --> 31:54.588
- He's checking the hookup.
- Hurry. I want to see lights on.

31:55.747 --> 31:56.964
Come on!

31:57.457 --> 31:59.004
Where the hell is it?

31:59.167 --> 32:02.842
Go around there.
He said it's around to the left.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.975
Yeah, I think I found it.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.038
He would have found us anyway.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.541
You don't know him.

32:40.125 --> 32:42.469
He would have followed us
and found us.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.762
It was no sleepover, Cora.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.720
I'm just disappointed.
I thought we had something.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.099
You just don't know
what it's like.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.732
Be a woman trapped
in this kind of--

32:59.102 --> 33:00.649
You don't know.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.569
There's always a way, Cora...

33:07.569 --> 33:09.697
...if we stick together.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.923
I didn't know what to do.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.804
Cora?

33:27.547 --> 33:28.969
Cora.

33:31.801 --> 33:33.678
I gotta have you, Frank.

33:35.889 --> 33:37.687
If it was just us...

33:40.977 --> 33:43.230
If it was just you and me...

33:45.398 --> 33:47.150
What are you talking about?

33:49.528 --> 33:52.907
I'm tired of what's
right and wrong.

33:55.784 --> 33:58.708
They hang people for that, Cora.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.498
Cora!

34:09.505 --> 34:10.882
Cora!

34:11.049 --> 34:13.143
How many times I gotta call you?

34:13.301 --> 34:15.099
Come here.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.266
Hey, come here.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.801
Hey, Frank, it look good from here.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.712
Yeah, it's a hell
of an idea you had.

34:48.878 --> 34:50.094
Yeah, ha, ha.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.634
Neon, huh? Neon!

36:12.879 --> 36:14.381
All right?

36:17.092 --> 36:19.766
I'll honk the horn.
Twice for danger.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.021
And the door?

36:23.515 --> 36:25.517
Locked from the inside.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.986
- Then down the ladder and that's it.
- Yeah.

36:36.903 --> 36:39.247
Do you love me, Frank?

36:41.991 --> 36:43.459
Sure.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.082
You know I do.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.717
Don't worry about anything.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.684
Don't tell me that.

40:42.565 --> 40:43.942
Evening.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.786
You knew I had to stop
here, didn't you.

40:49.656 --> 40:51.078
She's beautiful.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.786
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?

40:54.953 --> 40:56.500
Uh, just today.

40:56.704 --> 40:58.331
That had to be.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.835
What's that?

41:03.586 --> 41:05.213
There's a damn cat up there.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.553
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.398
Hey, they sound a lot like
babies crying sometimes, don't they?

41:16.432 --> 41:18.059
Yes, they do.

41:24.357 --> 41:26.576
Well, I ought to get back to work.

41:26.734 --> 41:30.784
Yeah, well. We all got to sometime,
that's for sure.

41:30.947 --> 41:32.449
That's for sure.

41:32.615 --> 41:35.459
- Take care now.
- Okay, I'll do that.

41:47.630 --> 41:50.008
Aah! Frank!

41:52.176 --> 41:54.224
Frank, get over here!

41:55.054 --> 41:57.273
Oh, my God!

41:58.808 --> 42:02.563
Frank!
What happened to the lights?

42:04.522 --> 42:07.992
- I hit him. I hit him!
- Huh?

42:09.235 --> 42:11.954
I hit him, and all
the lights went out!

42:12.155 --> 42:15.329
Call an ambulance.
The cop came by. He saw everything.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.001
The cop? What cop?

42:17.243 --> 42:20.087
Get on the phone!
Get on the phone!

42:20.329 --> 42:23.424
I'm gonna die for this!
I know I am!

42:32.133 --> 42:33.635
Hello, Nick.

42:34.469 --> 42:37.973
Ugh. Nick, wake up. Nick.

42:49.150 --> 42:50.493
Come on, Nick.

42:50.693 --> 42:53.492
Come on, Nick! Wake up!

42:53.654 --> 42:58.330
Come on, Nick! Come on, Nick!
Nick, wake up! God.

43:00.536 --> 43:03.130
We'll know for sure
after we see the tests.

43:03.289 --> 43:06.384
It'll be about a week.
Only a week.

43:11.464 --> 43:12.636
Thank you.

43:12.799 --> 43:14.642
Can I have the book, please?

43:21.349 --> 43:22.441
Thanks.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.364
All he knows, it went dark.

43:37.073 --> 43:41.169
If he'd have turned around,
they'd have hanged us for it.

43:48.376 --> 43:50.344
And something...

43:50.503 --> 43:53.097
Something put that cop there.

43:55.466 --> 43:58.310
It's an act of God
those lights went out.

44:04.225 --> 44:05.397
Don't look back.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.689
- What?
- Don't look back. It's a cop.

44:09.856 --> 44:11.324
His red light's on.

44:11.482 --> 44:12.859
Oh, God.

44:13.943 --> 44:16.037
No, no, leave them on.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.455
Bathroom upstairs?

44:22.368 --> 44:23.540
Uh, yeah.

44:26.914 --> 44:29.167
What's that ladder doing there?

44:30.376 --> 44:31.969
I don't know.

44:34.463 --> 44:36.306
Come here.

44:37.383 --> 44:39.477
All right, sure.

44:57.361 --> 44:58.613
Hey.

45:02.283 --> 45:04.285
Cover's off this fuse box up here.

45:04.994 --> 45:08.589
That sucker stuck a paw in it,
fried him deader than hell.

45:08.956 --> 45:10.754
Yeah, how about that?

45:10.917 --> 45:14.763
It must have been those guys that,
uh, were working on the sign today.

45:15.171 --> 45:16.423
Well...

45:17.298 --> 45:19.642
Well, sounds like that.

45:25.681 --> 45:27.809
Sorry about your husband,
ma'am.

45:28.392 --> 45:29.814
Thank you.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.403
Thanks a lot.

45:45.785 --> 45:49.460
I'll, uh, get a flashlight.

46:42.591 --> 46:44.685
I know it's tough...

46:45.303 --> 46:47.351
...to go down and see him.

46:54.603 --> 46:57.072
You're sure you don't
want me to drive?

47:04.280 --> 47:05.782
Hurry back.

47:34.101 --> 47:36.320
Riders, to the right!

48:04.298 --> 48:06.426
Take it easy, guys,
there's enough for everyone.

48:12.807 --> 48:14.150
Cut pie.

48:14.308 --> 48:16.402
Little portions.

48:26.237 --> 48:27.534
Happy to help you.

49:10.656 --> 49:13.125
John Philip Sousa.

49:45.566 --> 49:47.739
I don't want to make love tonight.

50:03.417 --> 50:05.590
It's our last night.

50:05.753 --> 50:07.426
I know.

50:08.339 --> 50:10.558
I don't want to make love.

50:20.351 --> 50:22.103
You're right.

50:25.147 --> 50:26.694
Me neither.

50:47.294 --> 50:49.422
Oh, Christ, Cora.

51:44.393 --> 51:47.522
It's all in the feet.
You must watch the feet.

51:47.813 --> 51:49.315
Can I talk to you?

51:49.481 --> 51:52.109
- Just watch the feet...
- Can I talk to you?

51:52.359 --> 51:54.077
...how I dance and you'll learn--

51:54.278 --> 51:55.825
Excuse me.

52:02.328 --> 52:04.672
I can't talk about it now.

52:04.830 --> 52:06.878
What do you mean
you can't talk about it?

52:07.041 --> 52:10.295
Four days already,
you can't talk about it.

52:12.296 --> 52:14.469
Yeah, you don't understand.

52:16.300 --> 52:19.270
I can't do it anymore, Frank.
You understand?

52:19.428 --> 52:21.681
What can't you do?
What does that mean?

52:21.847 --> 52:24.020
You can't do it anymore?

52:43.035 --> 52:45.254
- It's over.
- Cora, come dance.

52:45.496 --> 52:48.170
What? What are you talking about?

53:39.425 --> 53:40.847
Bravo, Nicko!

54:16.754 --> 54:18.051
Frank, come here!

54:37.316 --> 54:39.910
This man save my life.
I found this man.

55:02.257 --> 55:04.225
Cora, my feets, you know?

55:10.057 --> 55:12.105
My feets.
My feets.

55:12.351 --> 55:13.978
They're beautiful.

55:14.812 --> 55:17.281
- Beautiful.
- You say it.

55:17.439 --> 55:20.067
You say it in Greek.

55:20.984 --> 55:23.237
Nick, I can't say it in Greek.

55:30.577 --> 55:32.579
Ah, come on,
you say it.

55:48.345 --> 55:49.642
Yes!

56:08.615 --> 56:12.245
Come here. Now you say it.
It's beautiful.

56:16.164 --> 56:18.087
Tonight.
Tonight.

56:18.250 --> 56:19.672
What?

56:19.835 --> 56:21.553
What?

56:59.875 --> 57:01.548
What are you doing?

57:03.003 --> 57:05.847
You're the guy's wife, Cora.
You told me that.

57:08.675 --> 57:10.052
You were gonna leave me.

57:13.805 --> 57:17.400
- I was writing you a note--
- What, a thank-you note?

57:17.559 --> 57:18.856
Huh?

57:19.019 --> 57:23.570
- Is that what you were doing?
- Cora, look, live here.

57:23.732 --> 57:25.655
Live with the guy.

57:26.526 --> 57:28.745
We took a chance.
We didn't make it.

57:29.279 --> 57:30.952
Live with the man.

57:32.407 --> 57:34.375
He wants to have a baby.

57:34.660 --> 57:36.128
You understand?

57:37.704 --> 57:39.422
He's changed.

57:39.665 --> 57:44.262
He says the accident changed him,
and now I'm supposed to have his kid.

57:48.840 --> 57:51.013
How am I gonna do that?

58:02.729 --> 58:05.608
How am I supposed to
have his baby?

58:06.149 --> 58:08.698
I can't have his baby.

58:10.737 --> 58:14.583
The only one I could have
a baby by is you.

58:17.703 --> 58:19.797
Okay. Shh.

58:28.171 --> 58:31.516
Say you won't leave me.
Please.

58:32.050 --> 58:34.348
Just stall him, baby.

58:35.429 --> 58:37.306
Just stall him.

58:55.866 --> 58:58.915
- You going far?
- We go to Ventura.

58:59.077 --> 59:02.126
A trip.
A change of scenery.

59:03.331 --> 59:07.052
- Much farther?
- it's a couple hours.

59:09.421 --> 59:10.513
That's it.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.470
What do I owe you?

59:12.632 --> 59:15.135
Uh, $1.44.

59:17.888 --> 59:20.562
- Here you go.
- Be right back.

59:37.365 --> 59:38.742
Here's your change.

59:38.950 --> 59:40.952
I'm gonna drive now.

59:41.119 --> 59:43.372
- You're not going to drive.
- What?

59:43.538 --> 59:47.293
You can't even walk. What are you
talking about? Get in the back.

59:47.459 --> 59:49.211
- What?
- Get in the back.

59:49.419 --> 59:51.763
What are you, nutty?
I wanna drive home.

59:52.005 --> 59:54.849
- Come on, Frank.
- You don't want to drive tonight.

59:55.092 --> 59:58.471
What, do you own this car, big fella?
Huh?

59:58.637 --> 01:00:01.015
- Frank.
- Just get in the back.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.567
All right.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.444
That's it.

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:17.323
You drive safely now, okay?
Good night.

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:30.635
How about some wine?

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:32.554
- Come on, Nick.
- Ha, ha.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:36.300
Hey, Frank...

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:39.140
ls nothing like to have wife.

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.356
Cut it out!

01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:50.321
Is drunk.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:02.875
Shit!

01:01:03.034 --> 01:01:05.628
Cora, don't talk like that.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:08.490
It's boiling over, Nick.
I gotta pull over.

01:01:08.516 --> 01:01:09.191
What?

01:01:26.892 --> 01:01:29.771
Wake him up, huh?

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:32.447
Wake him up. Fix it.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.192
Frank?

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:37.903
Frank!

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:49.130
Frank, wake up.
The car's stopped.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.884
Come on, wake up.
You gotta fix it.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:57.597
Frank, get out of the car.

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:02.010
Nick?

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:11.607
Shit.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:16.321
I'll fix it myself.

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:20.870
What's the matter...

01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:22.576
...with door?

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:24.912
Handle no open.

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:28.624
There, I got it.

01:02:30.705 --> 01:02:32.002
Oh.

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:38.596
Is he dead?

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:50.275
Get in.

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:54.981
Come on, Cora.
Get in. Get in!

01:02:55.146 --> 01:02:56.568
No!

01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:59.113
No.

01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:04.952
Drive.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.597
Put it in neutral.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.023
Push.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.146
Wait.

01:04:53.848 --> 01:04:56.146
Come on, Cora.
Come on.

01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:02.273
Do it.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:04.783
Do it.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:06.870
Come on.

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:08.955
Do it!

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:20.174
You hurt me.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:35.106
You got this on the dash.

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.485
And you don't know
where you got this.

01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:12.306
What?

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.545
Frank!

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:05.999
Frank!

01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:10.128
Oh, no-- Oh, God!

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:16.759
God.

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:23.015
Oh, God! Aah!

01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:25.149
Stop!

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:26.352
Stop!

01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:32.826
There's been an accident!
You have to help me!

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:34.577
Oh, God!

01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:38.490
Thank you.

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.711
How are you today?

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.348
Fine.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:08:59.176
Have you ever been
in San Francisco?

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:02.147
- Yeah.
- In Buffalo?

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:05.979
Who are you, mister?

01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:08.234
You know who I am.

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:10.567
You did time in Buffalo.

01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:14.151
In Wichita, armed robbery,
reduced to--

01:09:14.317 --> 01:09:17.491
- Can we talk about this later?
- Saying you held up a card game.

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:21.908
Moline, Illinois, 13 months,
assault on a rail road investigator.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.705
They gave me something.

01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:28.211
If you plead innocent and make me try you
for homicide, I'm gonna see that you hang.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:32.423
What're you saying? This have
something to do with this accident?

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:36.301
- I wasn't even driving.
- Oh, you weren't driving.

01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:39.013
You were too drunk to drive,
you were too drunk to walk.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:42.304
You have a witness at the station.
Yes, yes, yes.

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:45.019
Who do you think you're dealing with?
I know you killed him.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.478
Come on.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.984
Why would I want to kill him?

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:52.779
Oh, buddy, I saw her.
I might kill for her.

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:54.816
Why would I kill for that?

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.028
Forget the girl.
They'll hang you for the money.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:03.033
What money?

01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:05.914
The $10,000 life
insurance policy...

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:08.830
...issued on Nick Papadakis
by Pacific Reliance.

01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:14.135
His wife, the sole beneficiary.
Does that look familiar, Frank? Huh?

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:19.765
Don't play with the insurance company.
They don't like to lose.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:24.847
I swear I don't know nothing
about no insurance policy.

01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:26.810
Oh, come on, Frank.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:29.396
Either she did it, or you did
it together. Which is it?

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:32.028
- I didn't kill him.
- Prove it to me, Frank.

01:10:32.437 --> 01:10:35.657
- How am I gonna prove it to you?
- Sign this.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:39.736
What is this?

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:43.907
It's the only thing that will convince
me and the jury you're innocent.

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:45.495
All right, Frank?

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.332
Let's get out of here.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.605
It's all right.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.367
My name is Katz.

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:30.628
I'm representing you
and Mrs. Papadakis.

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:33.627
You two will be
arraigned tomorrow.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:38.421
Until then, anybody ask you anything,
you say, "Talk to the lawyer."

01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:40.384
You understand that, Frank?

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:44.008
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:52.191
Did you sign this?

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.693
Don't sign anything else.

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:02.285
Okay.

01:12:02.944 --> 01:12:05.117
You got yourself pretty banged up.

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:08.374
Good.
It'll look good in court.

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.083
Hey.

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:12.499
Are you gonna see Cora?

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:15.502
Yeah.

01:12:17.208 --> 01:12:19.302
Tell her I didn't mean it.

01:12:37.228 --> 01:12:38.696
It was broken in the act.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:42.985
It was used to strike the victim
on the head, which caused his death.

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:47.200
Could the victim's injuries have
been caused by an overturning car?

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:49.115
- No.
- I object, Your Honor.

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:50.704
This man is not a doctor.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:53.620
This man, Your Honor,
is an acknowledged expert...

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:55.538
...in the field of insurance fraud.

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:59.175
This man is an interested party.
If my clients are convicted...

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:02.303
...his company, Pacific Reliance,
stands to save $10,000.

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:03.553
Mr. Katz.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:06.717
I object and request that
his testimony be stricken.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.180
Overruled.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:12.054
Thank you, I'm finished.

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:19.321
Your Honor, at this time, I will submit
a complaint and request for damages...

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:22.072
...sworn by Frank Chambers
against Mrs. Cora Papadakis...

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.357
What?

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:26.027
...for injuries sustained in a car
under her control.

01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:29.538
- Your Honor, I object to this complaint.
- What? What complaint?

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:31.415
Did you sign something, Frank?

01:13:32.283 --> 01:13:35.082
Tell me. Did you sign
something against me?

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:38.714
- Sit down, Cora.
- You wouldn't do that to me, would you?

01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:42.343
- He wouldn't do that!
- Your Honor, that is exactly--

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:45.300
What did he sign?
What complaint are you talk--?

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:48.140
- What complaint?
- Absent adjudication on--

01:13:48.299 --> 01:13:50.643
Show it to me!
Show it to me!

01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:54.431
- I want to see it! I don't believe it!
- Overruled.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:57.100
- Enter the complaint.
- I don't believe it!

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.609
You cannot enter the complaint.

01:13:58.809 --> 01:14:02.780
It was extorted from a seriously injured
man under the influence of drugs...

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.862
...and pain,
without the benefit of counsel.

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:07.777
I've ruled on this.
Will you proceed?

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:36.431
Under the circumstances
of this ruling...

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:41.728
...I have no alternative but to plead
Mrs. Papadakis guilty as charged.

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:44.647
- State accepts the plea.
- Your Honor, move to adjourn.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:45.940
Accepted.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.157
You're working for the state!

01:14:55.366 --> 01:14:58.415
- Let go of me!
- Don't say anything to them.

01:15:24.311 --> 01:15:27.941
- You're making a terrible mistake.
- Just shut up.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:39.956
Okay, ready?

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.005
Okay, this is my statement.

01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:56.143
We did it all.

01:15:58.137 --> 01:16:01.562
Frank Chambers and I planned it...

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:03.818
...and he killed my husband.

01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:54.819
- I'll just be a few minutes, all right?
- Fine.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:08.212
- I appreciate you seeing me.
- What is it? They're guilty.

01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:11.344
- Yeah, that's yet to be decided.
- They're guilty.

01:17:11.585 --> 01:17:14.509
Now I can plead them
innocent in 48 hours.

01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:18.176
Yeah, yeah. Look, they tried
to kill him once before.

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:21.846
Oh, that's very interesting
you should think that. Huh.

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:25.100
On March 5, there was a party.
I got a fucking Greek army...

01:17:25.266 --> 01:17:27.564
...that'll swear Papadakis
said of Chambers:

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:30.605
"That is the man
who saved my life."

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:35.072
- I think you got it backwards.
- Off the record?

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:39.289
- Sure.
- You don't mean to say they're innocent.

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:43.618
That's precisely what I'm telling you.
And that's what I'll tell the jury.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:48.002
The prosecution's got no case.
No evidence, no witnesses, nothing!

01:17:48.205 --> 01:17:49.878
All they've got is you.

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:51.967
And what are you doing, huh?

01:17:52.418 --> 01:17:56.343
Don't forget, I am talking
to poor people out there.

01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:59.926
Now, that jury, they have
got a very attractive...

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:02.887
...grief-stricken young woman
on that stand on the one hand.

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:05.890
And on the other hand,
they got you, pal.

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:10.945
You and your, uh, big insurance
company, trying to save 10 grand.

01:18:13.063 --> 01:18:14.440
We'll see.

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.364
What do you think?

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:21.664
I still think they're
gonna burn them.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:23.908
And if they don't...

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:27.119
...you've cost your
company 10 grand.

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:30.172
There goes your Christmas bonus.

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:32.087
You wanna take that chance?

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:37.968
I'm gonna show you a way that you
don't have to take a chance.

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:39.340
Now what?

01:18:43.302 --> 01:18:44.724
Okay.

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.683
This is Art Beeman, Claims Department,
Western Equitable.

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:50.192
Hello, Beeman.

01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:52.482
- Glad to meet you.
- Tell him.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:58.242
Well, uh, my company issued
a $25,000 liability policy...

01:18:58.484 --> 01:19:00.236
...home, business, auto...

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:03.914
...to Mr. Nick Papadakis,
just slightly before his death--

01:19:05.157 --> 01:19:07.285
Frank Chambers was
a passenger in the car.

01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:10.838
He sustained various lacerations,
a concussion and back trauma...

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:13.882
...which will impair
his ability to walk.

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:18.550
If she was trying to kill her husband
and in the process, made my man...

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:22.554
...an employee and passenger
in her car, a cripple for life...

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.522
...I'm gonna go into court and sue Western
Equitable for 25 grand, and I'm gonna win.

01:19:29.056 --> 01:19:32.230
So here's what he's prepared to do.

01:19:32.393 --> 01:19:34.737
Would you excuse us, please?

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:37.026
I would.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:49.201
Western's in an
unprotected posture here.

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.504
You're saying you'd reimburse?

01:19:52.997 --> 01:19:54.123
Precisely.

01:19:54.832 --> 01:19:59.679
Now, if you were prepared,
we'd pay the $10,000 death benefit.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:03.140
- Cleared this with your people?
- Absolutely.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:06.093
Well,
I think we can do business.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:25.864
Here you go, Frank.
I already signed for them.

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.664
Go ahead.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.413
Come on, take it.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:37.675
No, we got 27 up here already.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.380
Make that 26.

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:41.045
They never had a thing.

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:43.263
They bluffed you.
Sackett bluffed you.

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:45.390
Gets you to sign a complaint
against the woman...

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:49.270
...uses it to get her to confess,
and you both walk the plank.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:51.142
Get it?

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:55.525
Come on, my boy.
You're going home.

01:20:55.809 --> 01:20:58.653
- Come on, we'll get you changed.
- You're kidding.

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:01.569
You're kidding me!

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.109
Here you are.

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:07.200
She's free?

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:09.073
That is correct.

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:11.450
- But, uh...
- But what?

01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:12.784
She confessed.

01:21:12.993 --> 01:21:15.746
Luckily, she confessed
to my assistant, Kennedy.

01:21:15.996 --> 01:21:18.715
Red-headed guy?
Bet you thought he was a cop, huh?

01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:20.004
Yeah, I did.

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:22.670
- Uh-uh. He wasn't. Works for me.
- Really?

01:21:22.836 --> 01:21:24.008
Mm-hm.

01:21:25.172 --> 01:21:28.096
Thought it might be a good idea
to get it off her chest.

01:21:28.342 --> 01:21:30.140
She seemed very upset.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.012
Frank, uh...

01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:34.974
Let's go out the back way,
avoid the press, okay? Come on.

01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:37.105
Where are they going?
Where's the girl?

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:42.155
The best part was the insurance.

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:46.319
Mr. Barlow, their expert, stands up
in court, says he made a great mistake.

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:49.204
The whole thing was
an auto accident.

01:21:49.363 --> 01:21:51.411
Hell of a world, huh, Frank?

01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:53.750
Yeah.

01:21:54.827 --> 01:21:56.204
Where's Cora?

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:58.130
Outside in a cab,
waiting with Kennedy.

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.924
I knew I'd find you here,
sneaking out.

01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:03.753
- Yeah, that's right.
- You'd best sneak out.

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:07.097
The file stays open on you.
On you and the woman both.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:09.216
You put yourselves above the law.
You killed.

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:12.637
You can't talk to me that way.
I been inside a court of law!

01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:15.056
You'll be back, my friend.
I know your type.

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:16.644
Yeah, I'll see you again.

01:22:17.891 --> 01:22:20.110
Spit on the sidewalk,
you'll die in jail.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:23.318
Hey, hey.
Learn to lose, huh?

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:39.125
Well, uh...

01:22:41.039 --> 01:22:42.461
Thanks a lot.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:44.922
That's okay.

01:22:45.085 --> 01:22:47.087
You took our part, eh?

01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:50.349
And you made me $10,000.

01:22:51.008 --> 01:22:52.510
Kennedy.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.305
It's been swell.

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:37.684
I had to pay him the
insurance money, the lawyer.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.812
Yeah, I know.

01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:44.444
I didn't even know
he had an insurance policy.

01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:53.329
Can't leave this state for six months.
I gotta call them every week.

01:23:55.155 --> 01:23:57.249
I'm gonna have a record.

01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:07.168
Cora?

01:24:15.592 --> 01:24:17.811
I didn't mean to turn on you.

01:25:24.995 --> 01:25:26.588
That's mine.

01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:14.587
- She doesn't look that old.
- That's her. I saw her picture.

01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:19.892
- She is acting exactly as I expected.
- She'll hear you.

01:26:21.134 --> 01:26:22.852
Wonderful pie.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.479
Miss?

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:27.061
Keep the change.

01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:30.860
Thanks. Come again, huh?

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:32.562
- Miss?
- Yeah.

01:26:32.813 --> 01:26:34.531
What about that chicken?

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:36.442
I'll have it in two minutes.

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:40.279
You think you could
get in and help out?

01:26:47.953 --> 01:26:49.125
You're doing fine.

01:26:49.329 --> 01:26:52.959
I'm doing fine. I'd do better
if you'd do some work around here.

01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:57.968
What are you killing yourself for?
We're leaving in two months.

01:26:58.338 --> 01:27:01.342
It's what you said. Soon as your
probation's up, we're leaving.

01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:03.639
You want to leave, Frank?

01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:07.397
You can go now.

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:12.895
You want to stay,
then do some work around here.

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:19.451
And will you use a glass?

01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:22.700
What are you, an animal?

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:32.373
What are you
gonna do with the money?

01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:39.379
I'm gonna buy a new car.

01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:49.856
What the hell do you care
what I'm gonna do?

01:28:00.609 --> 01:28:02.202
Move!

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:06.198
Move over. Come on!

01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:09.251
Bastard, get out of there.

01:28:09.451 --> 01:28:12.830
Get out.
Come on, move.

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:18.127
Damn it, you bastard!

01:29:04.965 --> 01:29:06.888
You folks need something?

01:29:20.397 --> 01:29:22.240
There you go, gentlemen.

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.068
I've been looking for you.

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:28.076
Well, you found me.

01:29:28.613 --> 01:29:31.036
I saw your picture in the paper.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.917
Join the club.

01:29:36.538 --> 01:29:38.461
Here's a menu.
I'll be right back.

01:29:38.623 --> 01:29:41.251
You know, I knew you
since you were a little girl.

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:44.838
I knew it was you.

01:29:45.922 --> 01:29:48.095
But I didn't want to call.

01:29:49.676 --> 01:29:51.974
I knew they'd lost track of you.

01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:56.433
I get the Courier still...

01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:58.147
...from home.

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:03.110
And I read about your mother.

01:30:04.357 --> 01:30:06.610
I was pretty sure
you didn't know.

01:30:10.322 --> 01:30:12.541
Oh, you don't remember me...

01:30:13.783 --> 01:30:15.785
...but I remember you.

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:38.400
- Want me to call the probation people?
- Don't call them.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:41.319
I'll be back next week,
the latest.

01:30:45.565 --> 01:30:47.784
I'm sure she'll be all right.

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.737
Let me know, huh?

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:53.615
Yeah, I will.

01:32:11.317 --> 01:32:13.285
So, what is this, a holiday?

01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:16.282
Closed.

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:18.666
Come on, give me a break, huh?

01:32:18.908 --> 01:32:20.956
What will it take you, a minute?

01:32:22.829 --> 01:32:23.830
Where you heading?

01:32:24.414 --> 01:32:25.791
San Diego.

01:32:42.766 --> 01:32:46.646
What have you got in the back there,
if you don't mind my asking?

01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:49.735
Cats.

01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:13.551
What is this?

01:33:14.172 --> 01:33:15.674
It's three cats.

01:33:15.882 --> 01:33:18.010
What are they, drugged?

01:33:19.552 --> 01:33:21.054
No, they're tired.

01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:24.148
They're very tired.

01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:26.105
These cats are drugged!

01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:28.524
I tell you they will not perform!

01:33:28.686 --> 01:33:31.314
I won't get in the ring with them.
Take them out of here.

01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:34.030
All right, all right.
What is it you need?

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:36.911
I told you. I need performers.

01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:38.447
I need wild animals.

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:41.207
- Where do you get them?
- Gutierrez.

01:33:41.366 --> 01:33:43.744
- Where are they?
- Mexico.

01:33:44.786 --> 01:33:46.754
All right, you get the cats.

01:33:46.913 --> 01:33:49.632
Join back up in Tucson on the 12th.
You do it.

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:51.293
- Okay. Okay.
- Good?

01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:54.095
Anything else you need?

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:56.923
Of course. A driver.

01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:01.720
Excuse me, that lady...
I just want you to put--

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:04.439
Take the cats away.
I'm sorry.

01:34:04.597 --> 01:34:07.350
You're right about that,
you know, miss.

01:34:07.517 --> 01:34:08.689
What's that?

01:34:08.852 --> 01:34:12.402
I just rode 100 miles with these cats,
and, uh, they didn't peep once.

01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:14.152
Is that so?

01:34:15.942 --> 01:34:17.990
Here's a fine little animal.

01:34:18.194 --> 01:34:20.697
Peep.
What about that?

01:34:21.948 --> 01:34:24.827
And who,
might I ask, are you?

01:34:26.161 --> 01:34:27.788
Frank Chambers, miss.

01:34:29.205 --> 01:34:31.458
Pleased to meet you, Frank.

01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:43.937
You know what I'd do for you?

01:34:46.222 --> 01:34:48.020
Buy you a hat.

01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:49.935
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:34:50.101 --> 01:34:53.071
Big white one.
You'd like that?

01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:55.072
Sure.

01:35:10.622 --> 01:35:12.249
Caress.

01:36:12.976 --> 01:36:15.946
Sorry about your mother,
Cora.

01:36:16.104 --> 01:36:17.572
She was old.

01:36:20.483 --> 01:36:22.451
Let's get a drink.

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:25.705
No, I quit it.
I'm not drinking anymore.

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:30.960
I've been thinking
about a lot of things, Frank.

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:34.713
Let's just go home.

01:36:58.604 --> 01:37:00.698
I'm gonna have a baby.

01:37:05.862 --> 01:37:08.240
I'm gonna have your baby, Frank.

01:37:12.035 --> 01:37:13.833
You want it?

01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:20.255
Yeah, I do.

01:37:24.297 --> 01:37:26.516
- Tell me you want it.
- I do.

01:37:26.716 --> 01:37:28.309
- You do?
- I do want it, yeah.

01:37:30.303 --> 01:37:32.647
- You do!
- Sure.

01:37:32.805 --> 01:37:34.227
Whoa!

01:37:36.934 --> 01:37:38.561
Jeez.

01:37:39.854 --> 01:37:42.152
We're gonna have a baby, huh?

01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:44.867
Think about that.

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:49.038
Yeah.

01:38:02.877 --> 01:38:05.505
We lost some business, Cora.

01:38:06.339 --> 01:38:07.841
I don't care.

01:38:10.927 --> 01:38:16.980
Ahem. I closed the place for a week.
Went to San Francisco.

01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:20.938
I don't care, Frank.

01:38:28.277 --> 01:38:30.075
I've been wrong,
haven't I?

01:38:31.656 --> 01:38:33.124
No.

01:38:35.284 --> 01:38:36.877
Yes, I have.

01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:39.580
I know I have.

01:38:45.628 --> 01:38:48.472
I've been making
our life hell here.

01:38:53.928 --> 01:38:55.430
But...

01:38:56.889 --> 01:38:59.438
I'm gonna change now.

01:39:03.563 --> 01:39:08.535
Because if we got
each other, Frank...

01:39:10.236 --> 01:39:12.705
...then we got everything.

01:39:17.493 --> 01:39:21.589
I want you to forgive me.
Please, God. Oh, God.

01:39:24.542 --> 01:39:27.671
Hey. Come on.

01:39:33.176 --> 01:39:36.305
So you wanna know what
I learned about babies?

01:39:39.557 --> 01:39:42.151
What the most important thing is?

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.937
Yeah.

01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:48.950
Is that you always gotta
be natural with them.

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:52.954
I'm always natural.

01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:58.660
Because they can tell, you know.
Young as they are, they know.

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:02.296
- Yeah, I believe that.
- So what you gotta do is two things.

01:40:02.455 --> 01:40:04.253
First one...

01:40:05.374 --> 01:40:08.628
First one is you gotta
follow your instincts.

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:11.047
What is it?

01:40:11.881 --> 01:40:13.303
The second thing--

01:40:15.259 --> 01:40:16.852
Tell them to go away.

01:40:18.638 --> 01:40:20.140
I'll get rid of them.

01:40:26.354 --> 01:40:27.571
Closed.

01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:29.607
Can I bother you for a minute?

01:40:29.815 --> 01:40:33.570
- We're closed.
- It won't take but a minute. Please.

01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:35.663
Just a minute.

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:48.589
Mr. Kennedy.
Remember me?

01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:51.300
Yeah, sure.
How's Mr. Katz?

01:40:51.462 --> 01:40:52.759
Yeah, right.

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:56.638
But, uh,
I don't work for him anymore.

01:40:57.218 --> 01:40:58.891
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

01:41:01.556 --> 01:41:03.183
What are you doing now?

01:41:03.349 --> 01:41:07.775
Uh, well, as a matter of fact,
I'm not doing anything.

01:41:09.313 --> 01:41:11.736
That's why I thought I'd drop by.

01:41:12.441 --> 01:41:15.945
You know, I thought maybe
you could help me out.

01:41:16.112 --> 01:41:18.615
Oh, yeah? In what way?

01:41:19.031 --> 01:41:21.250
What do you need,
a couple of bucks or something?

01:41:22.118 --> 01:41:24.712
I mean,
I know you're out of a job--

01:41:27.206 --> 01:41:29.129
You remember that...

01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:32.262
...that confession
that I typed up that time?

01:41:33.504 --> 01:41:36.974
Yeah, that phony thing
you and Katz dreamed up?

01:41:37.258 --> 01:41:38.805
Yeah, right.

01:41:38.968 --> 01:41:42.188
Yeah, well, you know,
when I left Katz...

01:41:44.890 --> 01:41:49.896
...l, uh, took the liberty of
taking it with me from his files.

01:41:50.896 --> 01:41:54.821
You know, I thought
the two of you might like it.

01:41:55.693 --> 01:41:57.070
Uh-huh.

01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:02.367
Nice place here.

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.082
You want $100?

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:11.633
I want 10 grand.

01:42:13.961 --> 01:42:18.307
Ten grand? What are you, crazy, bozo?
What are you, insane?

01:42:18.466 --> 01:42:20.434
- We gave the money to Katz.
- Who cares?

01:42:20.593 --> 01:42:23.096
I just want the money.
Get it for me.

01:42:23.888 --> 01:42:25.765
- Hey.
- Sell the place.

01:42:25.931 --> 01:42:29.435
Bring me 10 or I mail the confession
to Sackett, and you die.

01:43:02.551 --> 01:43:06.681
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you kidding me? Huh?

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:08.770
Fuck with my family!

01:43:09.475 --> 01:43:12.604
Huh? Huh?
Where's the paper?

01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:16.195
- I can't tell you.
- Where's the paper?

01:43:18.818 --> 01:43:21.037
- I got it in the bank.
- In the bank?

01:43:21.278 --> 01:43:23.030
- Which one?
- I can't tell you.

01:43:23.197 --> 01:43:24.574
Which one?

01:43:25.908 --> 01:43:27.535
Which one?

01:43:30.913 --> 01:43:33.257
Glendale Trust.

01:43:51.559 --> 01:43:53.061
Get the gun.

01:44:00.818 --> 01:44:02.365
How do you feel?

01:44:02.528 --> 01:44:03.871
I feel great.

01:44:04.029 --> 01:44:07.499
I'll get back as soon as I can.
You want anything from town?

01:44:10.536 --> 01:44:12.379
Let's go, Kennedy.

01:44:17.418 --> 01:44:19.045
You folks open?

01:44:21.756 --> 01:44:23.258
Sure.

01:45:19.897 --> 01:45:21.365
Cora?

01:45:28.405 --> 01:45:29.907
Cora?

01:46:24.295 --> 01:46:26.548
Your friend came by.

01:46:32.553 --> 01:46:34.726
You bastard!

01:46:40.019 --> 01:46:42.738
Don't come near me.

01:46:46.817 --> 01:46:49.320
You're scum, Frank.

01:46:51.614 --> 01:46:54.117
I knew that when I met you.

01:46:54.783 --> 01:46:57.081
You'll never change.

01:47:04.919 --> 01:47:06.671
Your confession.

01:47:17.348 --> 01:47:19.021
I don't even need it.

01:47:19.224 --> 01:47:21.067
I never did.

01:47:21.977 --> 01:47:24.400
They tried me for it once, Frank.

01:47:24.563 --> 01:47:27.191
They can't touch me now.

01:47:27.650 --> 01:47:29.323
You understand?

01:47:29.818 --> 01:47:32.162
It's in the Constitution.

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:36.955
Didn't you know that, Frank?

01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:43.924
But they can try you.

01:47:48.462 --> 01:47:51.090
They can still try you.

01:48:10.025 --> 01:48:11.868
Who are you calling?

01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:46.793
I'm cold.

01:49:47.831 --> 01:49:49.504
I'm cold.

01:50:09.645 --> 01:50:11.272
You sure about that?

01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:11.457
I want to marry you.

01:51:25.971 --> 01:51:28.770
You just want to shut me up.

01:51:32.019 --> 01:51:35.364
If I wanted to shut you up,
I'd have shut you up.

01:51:38.609 --> 01:51:40.452
I want to marry you.

01:51:50.245 --> 01:51:51.997
That what you want?

01:51:53.248 --> 01:51:54.670
Yeah.

01:51:58.503 --> 01:52:00.005
Today.

01:52:42.214 --> 01:52:43.841
Do you want to wait
till the weekend?

01:53:12.411 --> 01:53:15.085
You know, I've been thinking.

01:53:16.164 --> 01:53:18.542
Maybe we ought to
sell that place.

01:53:19.584 --> 01:53:22.554
Ah, it ain't bad out
here for kids.

01:53:22.796 --> 01:53:24.469
Keep pets.

01:53:39.313 --> 01:53:42.533
- Don't walk in there.
- Why not?

01:53:49.823 --> 01:53:52.793
You got a beer there? Huh?

01:53:58.332 --> 01:54:00.710
- There you go.
- Get the opener?

01:54:00.876 --> 01:54:02.344
Yep.

01:54:05.088 --> 01:54:07.056
That's it.
That's it.

01:54:16.266 --> 01:54:17.438
What's wrong?

01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:19.319
- It's okay.
- What's wrong?

01:54:19.478 --> 01:54:21.196
- You all right?
- Hurt for a minute.

01:54:21.355 --> 01:54:22.982
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:54:23.857 --> 01:54:27.737
- It's okay.
- No, no. Come on, get in. Take it easy.

01:54:30.238 --> 01:54:32.536
Yeah, it was just a minute.

01:54:32.699 --> 01:54:34.326
Kind of scared me.

01:54:35.285 --> 01:54:37.162
We'll get somebody
to take a look at you.

01:54:37.412 --> 01:54:40.382
- No, I'm fine.
- Hey, you listen to me.

01:54:56.515 --> 01:54:59.268
I just want to go home,
really, Frank.

01:55:00.936 --> 01:55:02.904
I'll have you looked at.

01:55:03.939 --> 01:55:06.283
I just felt a little funny.

01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:08.827
Like I strained something.

01:55:09.194 --> 01:55:10.912
That's what I mean.

01:55:45.939 --> 01:55:47.987
Feeling a little better?

01:55:49.359 --> 01:55:50.576
I feel great.

01:55:50.735 --> 01:55:52.453
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:55:52.612 --> 01:55:55.411
- Good. You look good.
- Yeah.

01:55:55.949 --> 01:55:57.371
You do.

01:55:57.534 --> 01:55:59.707
Why shouldn't I?
