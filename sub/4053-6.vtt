WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.093
(HARVEY READING)

00:02.461 --> 00:04.054
Avery McKernon
was the first client

00:04.129 --> 00:05.301
lever brought
into the firm.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.474
I have stacked my engines
up against Bronson

00:07.549 --> 00:09.426
and everyone else's
in the world, and mine win.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.854
Because I make sure they're
designed better than anyone else's.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.522
Then that's the speech
you're going to give.

00:13.597 --> 00:15.395
I said I was giving you
50% of McKernon.

00:15.474 --> 00:17.476
I didn't say I was keeping
the other 50%.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.362
You finally realized they need
an upgrade in representation.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.609
JESSICA:
It's up to you, Jack.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.782
Stand by
provision C-35

00:23.941 --> 00:25.238
or pack up your shit.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.819
I want you to tell me
the worst mistake

00:26.902 --> 00:28.119
you ever made
as a therapist.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.447
That wasn't
part of the deal.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.622
I killed someone.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.962
What? A client needed someone to

00:37.037 --> 00:40.792
get his son out of rehab so that he
could attend his mother's funeral.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.093
I knew deep down
inside he wasn't ready,

00:43.168 --> 00:44.886
but I gave
the go-ahead anyway.

00:44.962 --> 00:47.932
And the night
of the funeral,

00:48.799 --> 00:50.472
he overdosed and died.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.725
I'm surprised you called
for another appointment.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.515
What can I say? You telling
me that story got to me.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.941
So, you're ready
to tell the truth.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.485
lam. The woman in
my dream was Donna.

01:03.855 --> 01:05.698
<i>You wanna know</i>

01:06.358 --> 01:08.235
<i>Know where the heat is</i>

01:08.318 --> 01:10.992
<i>It's in our blood</i>

01:13.865 --> 01:16.709
<i>DR. AGARD: I don't think the woman
in your dream was actually Donna.</i>

01:17.160 --> 01:18.878
<i>I think it was
your mother.</i>

01:19.121 --> 01:20.247
<i>HARVEY: I don't believe it.</i>

01:20.330 --> 01:22.424
<i>I tell you the thing that's
been eating at me for days,</i>

01:22.499 --> 01:23.751
<i>and you call me a liar?</i>

01:23.834 --> 01:25.256
No, I'm not
calling you a liar.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.259
Your dream was a representation
of unresolved issues.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.558
The only unresolved issue
is I told you the truth,

01:31.633 --> 01:32.725
and you're turning on me.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.228
<i>DR. AGARD: Bringing up your
mother isn't turning on you.</i>

01:35.304 --> 01:37.227
<i>HARVEY: You have no idea what
bringing up my mother is to me.</i>

01:37.306 --> 01:39.729
<i>DR. AGARD: No, I don't. That's the
whole point of what we're doing here.</i>

01:39.808 --> 01:41.230
HARVEY: <i>Well, it doesn't
matter what we're doing here,</i>

01:41.310 --> 01:42.812
<i>'cause I'm not staying.</i>

01:42.894 --> 01:45.443
DR. AGARD: Harvey, I don't
care how much money you make

01:45.522 --> 01:47.616
or how many women
you sleep with.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.284
You have issues
in your life

01:49.359 --> 01:52.078
that are going to keep you from
having real relationships.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.864
<i>Now, you can tell yourself
it has nothing to do</i>

01:53.947 --> 01:56.120
<i>with your mother all you
want, but it's a lie,</i>

01:56.199 --> 01:57.701
<i>and you know it.</i>

01:59.369 --> 02:00.871
HARVEY: <i>And I said</i>
we're done.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.128
<i>We're following
the summer cold</i>

02:04.207 --> 02:07.802
<i>We're chasing shadows
of a feeling</i>

02:09.211 --> 02:10.508
<i>Into the wild</i>

02:14.926 --> 02:16.394
Louis, we need to talk.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.146
Oh, if it's about the
summer associate with B.O.,

02:18.221 --> 02:19.222
that is out of my control.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.857
It's about Jack Soloff.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.434
What? So help me,
if that asshole

02:22.517 --> 02:23.643
is backing out
of his agreement, I...

02:23.727 --> 02:25.274
No one's backing out
of anything.

02:25.354 --> 02:26.526
Well, then what's
the problem?

02:26.605 --> 02:27.822
Right now there is
no problem.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.866
We beat him.
He's been neutralized.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.319
But that's not where
I want him to stay.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.496
What do you mean?
I mean we won,

02:34.571 --> 02:36.323
but the man's shown
himself to be a force.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.955
And if he's ever gonna come
around to being on our side,

02:39.242 --> 02:41.119
we have to give him
time to lick his wounds.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.329
I don't care
what you say,

02:42.412 --> 02:44.756
but that weasel is never
gonna be on our side.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.674
And that's exactly
the kind of petty thinking

02:46.750 --> 02:49.845
that led to your feuds
with Scottie, Hardman,

02:49.920 --> 02:52.673
Harvey, me,
just to name a few.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.133
Jessica, this is different,
and you know it.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.388
Jack started
this whole thing.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.561
Louis, last night
you asked,

02:57.636 --> 03:00.105
"When were you going
to learn to listen to me?"

03:01.348 --> 03:02.975
The time is now.
And you said...

03:03.058 --> 03:04.105
I don't care what I said.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.112
If you let your pettiness
get the better of you

03:07.187 --> 03:08.939
with Jack,
so help me God,

03:09.398 --> 03:11.150
you will not be
the one left standing.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.446
You have my word.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:25.205 --> 03:26.457
Louis, I need
to talk to you,

03:26.540 --> 03:27.666
and I don't want
you to get upset.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.171
What is it?
Dominic Barone called.

03:29.251 --> 03:30.343
He wants to come in
for a meeting.

03:30.419 --> 03:31.671
Now, I know
he called me...

03:31.753 --> 03:33.380
Excellent.
Pick a time.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.306
But you're not mad that he
called me instead of you?

03:35.966 --> 03:37.263
Why would I be mad?

03:38.427 --> 03:39.428
Am I in the right office?

03:39.511 --> 03:41.434
Mike, you're thinking
of the old Louis.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.057
The new Louis
is not petty,

03:43.140 --> 03:44.767
and he definitely
does not get upset

03:44.850 --> 03:46.318
about things like
who called who.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.020
And may I ask where
the new Louis came from?

03:49.104 --> 03:50.105
From inside.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.527
I took a look at
the man in the mirror,

03:51.606 --> 03:52.983
and I decided it was
time to make a change.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.488
Well, I'm glad you did.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.328
And I don't know
what Dominic wants,

03:56.403 --> 03:57.655
but whatever it is,

03:58.155 --> 03:59.498
I'm looking forward to
working with you on it.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.537
Did you just hear that?
Yes.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.372
Then you know once Mike and
Dominic agree to a time,

04:07.456 --> 04:08.799
you need to reschedule it.
Louis.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.002
Dominic needs to learn
that I'm the man in charge.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.256
But you're not
the man in charge,

04:12.335 --> 04:14.713
because Harvey gave you and
Mike McKernon Motors to share.

04:14.796 --> 04:15.843
But Dominic
doesn't know that,

04:15.922 --> 04:17.673
and Mike and I gave him
a card at the same time.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.101
And Mike's
says "Associate,"

04:19.176 --> 04:20.928
and mine says
"Pearson Specter Litt,"

04:21.011 --> 04:22.979
and I crossed out the "Pearson
Specter" like I always do.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.727
Louis, did you not hear
what Jessica said

04:24.806 --> 04:26.103
about stopping
all the pettiness?

04:26.183 --> 04:28.231
Yeah, that was about Jack Soloff.
No, it was about pettiness.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.482
Donna, I'm sorry,
but I only have

04:29.561 --> 04:30.813
a certain amount
of non-pettiness in me,

04:30.896 --> 04:32.694
and the real Louis Litt
needs to come out somewhere.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.946
Okay, Louis, you want Dominic
to think you're the man?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.823
Mmm-hmm. Then you
need to stop worrying

04:36.902 --> 04:39.701
about who he called and start
worrying about what he needs,

04:40.489 --> 04:42.036
which is for you to
be a great lawyer.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.168
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

04:45.869 --> 04:46.995
Good, you're here.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.375
Did you file
the Johnson brief?

04:48.455 --> 04:49.957
Not yet.
Then do it this morning.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.134
I want to drop the hammer on
those guys this afternoon.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.758
Well, before you do, there's a
Sam Tull waiting to see you.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.133
Who the hell is Sam Tull?

04:56.213 --> 04:58.181
Tall, handsome,
steely blue eyes?

04:58.256 --> 04:59.382
Not ringing any bells.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.139
Well, maybe this will
knock the cobwebs out.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.720
He said the last time
you saw him, he was

05:02.803 --> 05:04.430
with Morello
Asset Management

05:04.513 --> 05:06.060
and you threatened
to kick his ass.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.474
You let him in my office?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.400
Do I look like
I was born yesterday?

05:09.476 --> 05:10.523
He's in the
conference room

05:10.602 --> 05:12.730
under the supervision
of one Rachel Zane.

05:12.896 --> 05:14.648
I told him if he didn't
behave himself,

05:14.731 --> 05:15.983
I'd kick his
ass myself.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.615
You'd do that, wouldn't you?
I sure as hell would.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.742
And if you don't get in there
this second, I'll kick yours.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.996
Don't tell me
you're here

05:29.079 --> 05:31.548
to take me up on that
offer to step outside.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.875
I'm not. Good, then
we've established

05:33.959 --> 05:35.552
that you're smarter than
the last time I saw you.

05:35.627 --> 05:36.844
Now get the hell
out of our offices.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.012
Harvey, the man
came to see us.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.135
Rachel, this man
is an asshole,

05:39.214 --> 05:41.262
and he was willing to let an
innocent person go to jail.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.686
And now I'm an innocent
person who could go to jail.

05:44.761 --> 05:45.933
What?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.181
I'm being accused of making
unauthorized trades.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.142
By Morello?
I don't work there anymore.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.397
I work at Butler Trading.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.194
Good for you. Were they
authorized or not?

05:53.270 --> 05:55.819
I swear to God
I didn't do one thing

05:55.897 --> 05:57.069
they don't know about.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.446
And let me guess,
you don't have any proof?

05:59.818 --> 06:01.570
No, I don't.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.288
Because that's
the way things work.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.786
Uh, what does
that mean?

06:05.866 --> 06:08.244
It means he's saying
they checked his trades

06:08.326 --> 06:10.044
enough to decide it was
okay with the risk,

06:10.120 --> 06:11.372
but not enough
to put it in writing.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.706
Okay, but why wouldn't
they put it in writing?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.757
Because they would rather
say I went rogue

06:14.833 --> 06:16.710
than pay a two
million dollar fine.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.170
HARVEY: Here's the
problem, Sam.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.302
Why should I believe you,
when the last time we met

06:21.464 --> 06:23.307
you were the one
who was willing to put

06:23.383 --> 06:24.635
an innocent person away?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.311
Because I didn't know
she was innocent.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.057
And the truth is
I didn't care.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.104
But you did.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.483
I'm telling you.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.782
I didn’t do this.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.736
Please, I need your help.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.905
If I find out
you're lying to me,

06:44.988 --> 06:46.581
this time I won't
just threaten you.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.374
I will beat the shit
out of you.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.334
<i>See the money, wanna stay
for your meal</i>

06:57.417 --> 07:00.762
<i>Get another piece of pie
for your wife</i>

07:00.837 --> 07:04.137
<i>Everybody wanna know
how it feel</i>

07:04.215 --> 07:07.469
<i>Everybody wanna see
what it's like</i>

07:07.552 --> 07:10.647
<i>I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind</i>

07:10.722 --> 07:12.440
<i>Me and missy is so early</i>

07:12.515 --> 07:14.108
<i>Busy, busy making money</i>

07:14.851 --> 07:16.068
<i>All right!</i>

07:16.144 --> 07:20.490
<i>All step back
I'm 'bout to dance</i>

07:21.858 --> 07:23.701
<i>The greenback boogie</i>

07:27.447 --> 07:28.949
Donna, could I talk
to you for a minute?

07:29.032 --> 07:31.126
Yeah, if you can tell me
where the honey is hiding.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.375
Hey. hey, hey, hey-

07:35.038 --> 07:37.382
(SIGHS)
Oh, sneaky little bear.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.756
So what's on your mind?
Okay, so I'm trying to plan

07:40.835 --> 07:42.052
something special
for our wedding.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.550
What? We're
getting married?

07:43.630 --> 07:44.802
Mike, this is so sudden.

07:44.881 --> 07:45.882
I'm gonna have to
think about it.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.593
And what about Rachel?
Oh, who cares about Rachel?

07:47.676 --> 07:48.848
I love you.
Are you finished?

07:48.927 --> 07:50.895
Do I have to be?
Donna, I'm serious.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.144
Okay, what do you need?

07:53.223 --> 07:54.475
Rachel told me
it was her fantasy

07:54.557 --> 07:56.730
to get married on her
birthday at The Plaza Hotel.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.812
So I called to
arrange it, but then...

07:58.895 --> 08:00.488
They're booked
for the next five years.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.023
How did you know that?

08:02.273 --> 08:04.150
Same reason you came to me for
help, I know what I know.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.611
Well, I need someplace
just as good.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.905
There is no place
just as good.

08:07.988 --> 08:08.989
So what am
I supposed to do?

08:09.072 --> 08:10.619
You already did what
you're supposed to do.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.625
You came to me.

08:13.451 --> 08:17.046
Now, put Brody back and
don't hide him this time.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.505
You named the bear?

08:18.581 --> 08:20.083
You want me to
help you or not?

08:27.048 --> 08:28.265
Paul Gilroy.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.558
Yes. And you are?

08:29.634 --> 08:32.477
I'm the guy who's gonna
keep Sam Tull out of jail.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.847
And how are you
gonna do that, Mister...

08:34.931 --> 08:36.183
Specter.

08:36.640 --> 08:37.984
Harvey Specter.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.775
You're gonna pay that fine
and admit what you did.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.950
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Mr.
Specter,

08:45.358 --> 08:47.827
but there's no way I'm admitting
to something I didn't do.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.028
Whether you
admit it or not,

08:49.112 --> 08:51.160
you're gonna write
a check either way.

08:51.489 --> 08:54.038
It's up to you whether it's for
two million or 30 million.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.585
My associate seems
to be running late,

08:55.660 --> 08:58.288
so go ahead, take me for
a walk down bullshit lane.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.373
We're suing you
for $30 million.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.676
Well, I must have fired
five other people,

09:02.751 --> 09:05.300
because wrongful termination's
capped at 5 million.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.263
We're not suing you
for wrongful termination.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.056
We're suing you for
malicious prosecution.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.100
You can't do that.
I'm not a prosecutor.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.391
No, you're not, but
you're framing my client

09:13.470 --> 09:14.847
for a crime
he didn't commit.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.307
So it's up to you, Paul.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.517
Write the little check
or the big check.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.477
Ball's in your court.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.528
Dominic, you're here
early. How are you?

09:29.611 --> 09:30.703
Good.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.622
In fact, I was just thinking
about the last time I was here.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.040
You were helping
me become CEO.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.083
Oh, come on, you pretty much
became CEO all on your own.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.832
Well, it doesn't matter
how I got there.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.500
You're gonna
help me stay there.

09:40.663 --> 09:41.755
What's that?

09:42.499 --> 09:44.501
The future of battery
powered engines.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.011
We need it,
or we don't survive.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.922
I'm guessing
there's a catch.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.427
The catch is
it costs a fortune.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.807
But I have a handshake deal
with the CEO of Range Tech.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.596
We started as
mechanics together,

09:55.678 --> 09:56.770
and if I can close
in two weeks,

09:56.846 --> 10:00.646
he'll sell me the whole company
at a price I can afford.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.851
If I can't,

10:02.477 --> 10:04.024
he puts it
on the market.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.734
We'll be out of
business in 10 years.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.448
LOUIS: What's going on?

10:07.524 --> 10:08.525
You guys starting
the meeting without me?

10:08.608 --> 10:09.985
No, Dominic just
got here early,

10:10.068 --> 10:11.445
but the headline
is he wants us

10:11.528 --> 10:13.371
to close a handshake deal
to buy Range Tech

10:13.446 --> 10:16.040
within the next two weeks, and I was
about to tell him that we could.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.160
Well, I'm sorry,
but we can't.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.290
What do you mean
you can't?

10:19.369 --> 10:21.622
I mean there's no way that we
can close a deal like this

10:21.704 --> 10:22.956
in two weeks without
skipping due diligence.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.633
No, Louis, he's known
the CEO for 30 years.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.834
So we don't
have to skip it,

10:26.918 --> 10:28.966
but we can do
a streamlined version.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.801
Okay, well, then we might
as well not do it at all.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.341
We don't get it
done in that time,

10:32.423 --> 10:34.596
I can lose this deal.
They put a clock on it.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.019
And why would
they do that?

10:36.344 --> 10:37.516
I'll tell you why.

10:37.595 --> 10:38.847
Because they know
you won't pay attention

10:38.930 --> 10:40.807
to whatever it is that they're
trying to slide by you.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.016
Slide something by me?

10:42.559 --> 10:44.732
This is my friend.
We have a handshake deal.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.279
A handshake deal
doesn't mean shit.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.401
MIKE: Louis!
It's okay, Mike.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.695
Obviously Louis
doesn't get me.

10:50.525 --> 10:53.904
Because to me, a handshake
deal means everything.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.500
So you do whatever due diligence
you can in the next week,

10:58.575 --> 11:00.452
because if you
mess up my deal,

11:00.869 --> 11:02.587
I'll be looking
for a new law firm.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.461
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

11:10.461 --> 11:11.883
Paul Gilroy's
lawyer called.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.681
That was fast. Want the bad
news or the worse news?

11:13.756 --> 11:15.929
Why don't you give me both and let
me decide what kind of news it is.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.511
Not only are they not
paying the fine,

11:17.594 --> 11:20.097
they also filed a motion
to have our suit dismissed.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.981
Man, I should've known.
Should've known what?

11:26.060 --> 11:28.358
That you were full of shit when
you said Dominic calling me

11:28.438 --> 11:29.860
to set up that meeting
didn't bother you.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.031
I don't care
who he called.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.654
I did what I did in there
because the client comes first.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.702
Bullshit, you antagonized
me and then Dominic.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.903
Oh, what meeting
were you in?

11:35.987 --> 11:37.739
I wasn't antagonizing him.
I was protecting him.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.496
Oh, really? By shitting all over
his idea and then pissing him off?

11:40.575 --> 11:41.952
I don't care if
we pissed him off.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.503
He doesn't need
a friend.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.376
What he needs is for us
to be great lawyers.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.378
Louis, you have 
a history of getting 
bent out of shape

11:47.457 --> 11:48.754
over hierarchy,
so don't tell me

11:48.833 --> 11:50.085
that has nothing
to do with this.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.385
Okay, fine, Mike. You
Know what, you're right.

11:51.461 --> 11:52.678
I did get bent
out of shape.

11:52.754 --> 11:53.846
Did.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.217
But then I got over it, because as
I said, the client comes first.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.552
You really expect me
to believe that?

11:58.635 --> 12:02.060
Mike, a few years ago, Dominic spent
90% of his time under the hood.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.185
He is rushing into this

12:03.306 --> 12:05.308
because he feels it's his
only chance, and you know it.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.985
You think Harvey would sign off
on this without due diligence?

12:10.271 --> 12:11.898
And let me guess, you expect
me to do all the work?

12:11.981 --> 12:13.904
No, you take half,
I take half.

12:13.983 --> 12:14.984
We do the work together.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.250
<i>DONNA: Oh, you're
not hearing me.</i>

12:26.329 --> 12:28.206
WEDDING PLANNER: Oh, I'm hearing you.
No, you're not.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.132
<i>I'm calling on behalf
of Michael Jordan.</i>

12:30.208 --> 12:32.210
I don't care who
you're calling for.

12:32.335 --> 12:33.632
We're booked
on that date.

12:33.711 --> 12:37.090
Oh, but your assistant,
Ginny, said that the Smiths

12:37.173 --> 12:38.925
might be
willing to, um...

12:39.175 --> 12:41.428
First of all, it's
Patricia, not Ginny.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.354
And it's the McMillans,
not the Smiths.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.931
<i>So, if you don't have
anything else, then...</i>

12:45.014 --> 12:47.016
You know what? That was
a legitimate quesfion,

12:47.100 --> 12:48.693
and it would be nice
if you weren't so rude.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.279
<i>So the least you can do is
messenger over a brochure,</i>

12:51.354 --> 12:54.608
because if you don't, Mr. Jordan is
gonna call the manager of The Plaza

12:54.691 --> 12:56.693
and get your ass fired.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.082
Louis, I need
to talk to you.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.250
LOUIS: I was just on
my way to see you.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.919
About the pending
EPA investigation?

13:07.036 --> 13:08.333
Shit. I thought
you'd be gloating.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.964
You're the one who wanted this.
I didn't want this.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.134
I feared this. If Dominic buys
Range Tech, he's in huge trouble.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.303
And if we tell him that without
having a solution, he'll fire us.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.880
That's the thing.
I have a solution.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.512
I found a company that has a
battery division that we can buy.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.887
Now, we just have
to approach them and...

13:20.967 --> 13:22.139
No. Did you not just
hear what I said?

13:22.218 --> 13:23.310
We cannot jeopardize
his deal.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.433
We won't be
jeopardizing it

13:24.512 --> 13:26.230
if we can get them to sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.774
And the only way we'll be
able to get them to do that

13:27.890 --> 13:30.063
is if they're our client. Well,
then it's a good thing they are.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.566
You found one
of our own clients?

13:32.603 --> 13:34.355
You're a genius. Yeah,
there's only one problem.

13:34.564 --> 13:35.690
They're Jack
Soloff's client.

13:35.773 --> 13:36.990
Forget it, we need to
find another company.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.318
There is no
other company.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.493
Mike, there is
no way that Soloff

13:39.569 --> 13:41.196
will work with us
on this. He hates me.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.122
Then we have to find a way
to make him un-hate you,

13:43.197 --> 13:45.325
because I'm telling you,
this deal is good for Jack,

13:45.408 --> 13:47.581
and it is good for us.
There has to be a way.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.371
Well, then you
talk to him.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.340
Are you... Are you
saying you want me

13:53.416 --> 13:55.168
to negotiate with
Soloff on my own?

13:55.251 --> 13:56.753
I'm saying we're a team,
and there's a better chance

13:56.836 --> 13:58.588
of Soloff saying yes
to you than to me.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.557
Oh, hey.
Hey.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.431
What are you doing here? I was just
getting an NDA. What are you doing here?

14:08.598 --> 14:10.600
I am actually
here for you.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.106
I'm making copies of a
brochure from The Plaza Hotel.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.530
Wait, so you
got it done?

14:15.605 --> 14:17.733
No, I called them,
and they were dicks,

14:17.815 --> 14:19.067
and they got
pissed at me.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.114
So you failed?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.405
Okay.

14:23.946 --> 14:27.200
If by "failed," you mean
I got the name

14:27.283 --> 14:28.535
of the wedding planner,
her assistant,

14:28.618 --> 14:30.165
the couple getting
married, and a brochure

14:30.244 --> 14:33.623
with their letterhead on it, then,
yeah, Mike, yeah, I failed.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.004
Whoa, Donna, are you sure
you can handle this?

14:36.084 --> 14:37.461
Do you ask a chef
who's cooking

14:37.543 --> 14:39.136
if the meal's gonna
turn out okay?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.014
No, you sit back,
you behave yourself

14:42.256 --> 14:46.102
until you get the best Duck a
I'Orange you've ever tasted.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.096
Yeah, I don't really like
duck with orange stuff.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.522
Get out.
Gone.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.185
(SIGHS)

14:55.853 --> 14:57.571
GRETCHEN: I like
the way you operate.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.490
Excuse me?

14:59.982 --> 15:01.484
Never let them
see you sweat.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.907
What makes you
think I'm sweating?

15:03.986 --> 15:05.238
MY eyes.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.115
You may have fooled Opie
with that metaphor,

15:07.198 --> 15:08.950
but we both know you
got duck a la shit.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.956
Okay, new girl, I don't
know who you think

15:11.035 --> 15:13.788
you're talking to,
but this is what I do.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.499
What you do.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.716
I've been doing
shit like this

15:17.792 --> 15:20.341
since you was an itch
in your daddy's pants.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.759
Hang on, did you just
quote <i>Lethal</i> Weapon to me?

15:26.509 --> 15:27.852
You got that?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.180
Maybe you do
have something.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.767
Good luck
with your duck, Red.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.777
Mr. Tull, how long have you
been working at Butler Trading?

15:39.856 --> 15:41.028
Almost three years.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.324
And how much money
have you made

15:42.400 --> 15:43.743
for their clients
over that time?

15:43.818 --> 15:46.321
Approximately $150 million.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.077
HARVEY: So let me get this straight.
You made a trade,

15:48.156 --> 15:49.578
lost money,
they did nothing.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.251
But the day they find out
that they have to pay a fine,

15:52.326 --> 15:53.953
they said you
were acting alone

15:54.036 --> 15:55.379
and they're letting
you go to jail?

15:55.455 --> 15:56.627
Exactly.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.299
And how do you know they
signed off on your trade?

15:58.374 --> 16:01.878
Because everyone knows that
they sign off on every trade.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.297
HARVEY: And, ultimately,
who would be responsible

16:04.547 --> 16:06.925
for stopping a trade
that violated regulations?

16:07.133 --> 16:09.135
Paul Gilroy.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.937
So it couldn't possibly be that
you knew what you were doing,

16:12.013 --> 16:14.766
you kept it secret, and that
all of this is your fault?

16:14.849 --> 16:16.522
It could be,
but it isn't.

16:16.601 --> 16:19.525
Well, that's interesting, because
we have somebody who says it is.

16:19.604 --> 16:20.651
And who
the hell is that?

16:20.730 --> 16:21.982
Mr. Tull's therapist.
SAM: What?

16:22.064 --> 16:24.158
A therapist can't testify
against their own patient.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.110
She can if we paid for it
and he signed a waiver,

16:26.194 --> 16:27.741
which he did.

16:30.239 --> 16:33.368
LAWYER: Mr. Tull, your
therapist's testimony is coming,

16:33.451 --> 16:36.250
and when it does, your ability
to cut a deal goes away.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.338
Drop this matter,

16:38.414 --> 16:40.883
and no one ever knows
you saw a therapist at all.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.094
You went to see a company
provided therapist,

16:47.173 --> 16:48.516
and you never told me?

16:48.591 --> 16:51.435
I didn't think it mattered.
Well, it goddamn does.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.513
Did you tell this
woman you did this?

16:53.596 --> 16:55.143
No, because
I didn't do this.

16:55.223 --> 16:57.351
Well, they're not bringing
her in to testify to that.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.060
I told her that
I felt guilty,

16:59.143 --> 17:00.736
<i>as</i> if the whole thing
was my fault.

17:00.811 --> 17:01.858
I never said it was.

17:01.938 --> 17:02.985
Well, you might
<i>as</i> well have,

17:03.064 --> 17:04.236
because that's what
it's gonna sound like.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.067
Harvey. How could
you be so stupid

17:06.150 --> 17:08.152
to confide your feelings
to a stranger?

17:08.236 --> 17:09.453
Because I needed help.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.748
And if you're not gonna
talk about your feelings,

17:11.989 --> 17:13.912
you might as well not
see a therapist at all.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.584
You better hope there
are therapists in prison,

17:15.660 --> 17:17.333
because if I can't
stop her from testifying,

17:17.411 --> 17:19.084
that's where
you're gonna end up.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.138
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

17:33.344 --> 17:36.188
Mike Ross, what brings
you down to my office?

17:36.264 --> 17:37.982
I'm here with
a proposal from Louis.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.775
You're here because Louis
wants something from me,

17:39.850 --> 17:41.397
but he's too
afraid to ask.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.151
He's not afraid. He just sent
me here because he figured

17:44.313 --> 17:46.190
you might hear it
better coming from me.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.407
Well...

17:47.483 --> 17:49.030
McKernon Motors wants
to make an investment

17:49.318 --> 17:50.820
in battery technology.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.991
We'd like to quietly
negotiate with Tanaka,

17:54.073 --> 17:56.075
and we need your help
getting them to sign this.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.044
And why would
I do that?

17:59.120 --> 18:00.292
Because it's huge money,

18:00.371 --> 18:02.089
and now that contingent
compensation

18:02.164 --> 18:04.258
is back at the firm,
it's huge money for you.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.753
And the last time Louis came
to me with an offer like this,

18:06.836 --> 18:10.090
it was bullshit. Well, I'm not
Louis, and this isn't bullshit.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.174
Then I guess I just
have one question.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.309
How much of the deal are you
authorized to give away?

18:14.385 --> 18:16.262
50%, and
that's more than fair.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.849
Maybe it is,
but I want all of it.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.442
You know this helps
your client, right?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.565
I don't give a shit.
All of it or none of it.

18:23.644 --> 18:24.691
It's gonna be
none of it,

18:24.770 --> 18:26.568
and you're just taking money
out of your own pocket.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.570
I don't care, because
this isn't about money.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.743
It's about getting even,
so, you run along.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.786
Go tell Louis I'm not
lifting a finger to help him

18:32.862 --> 18:34.284
unless I get everything.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.365
Wow, you really
are a dick.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.876
I take it that means
you know where I stand.

18:54.717 --> 18:57.015
Jessica, hi.
What can I do for you?

18:57.219 --> 18:58.436
How's the wedding
planning going?

18:58.512 --> 19:00.856
Oh, well, we're still
looking for a venue,

19:00.931 --> 19:03.059
but things are
moving along.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.611
I hear a lot of couples
fight during this time.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.313
Well, I happen
to have a fiancé

19:07.396 --> 19:09.273
who's smart enough
to leave everything to me.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.865
But that is not
why you're here.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.071
I want to know
how Harvey's doing.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.740
With our case?
No.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.913
I just want to know
how he's doing.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.079
He's doing fine.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.169
Keep an eye on him.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.758
I will.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.972
(KEYS CLACKING)

19:34.048 --> 19:35.049
(DOOR OPENS)

19:35.800 --> 19:36.972
What are you
doing here?

19:37.051 --> 19:38.553
You're coming to
my offices tomorrow

19:38.636 --> 19:40.559
to testify against my client
and you didn't tell me?

19:40.638 --> 19:43.232
I didn't tell you because this is
the first I'm hearing about it.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.775
Bullshit. I saw it.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.111
You got subpoenaed to
testify against Sam Tull.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.529
And until you just
burst in here,

19:48.604 --> 19:50.322
I had no idea
he was your client.

19:50.398 --> 19:52.116
Well, it doesn't matter because
you're not showing up.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.034
And you're going to stop them
from arresting me, are you?

19:54.110 --> 19:55.657
Because that's what
will happen if I don't.

19:55.736 --> 19:58.034
Then get yourself someone
like me and get out of it.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.708
For your information, I have been
to three different men like you,

20:00.783 --> 20:02.205
because I care
about Sam,

20:02.576 --> 20:03.577
and you know
better than I do

20:03.661 --> 20:05.538
that once he signed that
release, I have no choice.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.339
Well, I have a way
to get you out of it,

20:07.415 --> 20:08.541
and you're gonna do it.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.922
They ask you something that's
gonna send him to jail,

20:11.001 --> 20:12.423
you lie.
I can't do that.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.549
You can, and you will, and
they'll never know. I'll know.

20:15.631 --> 20:16.928
And even if I didn't,
I have notes,

20:17.007 --> 20:19.226
and if they found those,
I'd be going to jail.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.178
Then destroy them,
because he's innocent,

20:21.262 --> 20:22.935
and he trusted you
with everything.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.515
And if that doesn't
mean something to you,

20:24.598 --> 20:27.021
then why the hell should anyone
ever trust you with anything?

20:28.728 --> 20:31.151
Harvey, this
isn't about us.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.153
No one can ever
make me do that to you.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.198
I'm sure Sam Tull
thought the same thing.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.492
LOUIS: Well?

20:44.326 --> 20:45.373
It's not gonna work.

20:45.453 --> 20:46.500
He said no?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.172
He said he wants
100% of the deal.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.045
Piece of shit.
I know.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.550
So...

20:52.126 --> 20:54.345
I don't know. We're gonna have
to think of something else.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.308
(SIGHS)
Give it to him.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.512
What?
I said give it to him.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.056
Louis, hey, I know
we're under the gun

21:06.140 --> 21:07.687
with this Dominic thing,
but I really don't think

21:07.767 --> 21:09.519
it's a good idea to let him
push you around like that.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.104
I'm not letting him
push me around.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.981
I'm listening
to my leader.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.448
What are you
talking about?

21:15.524 --> 21:17.947
Remember when you asked me where
the new Louis was coming from

21:18.027 --> 21:19.950
and I told you from me?
It wasn't from me.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.826
It was from Jessica.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.667
She asked me to stop the
pettiness once and for all.

21:24.742 --> 21:27.291
And if I can't do that now,
I'll never be able to do it.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.711
Okay, then I guess
all we have to do

21:31.791 --> 21:34.214
is figure out a way to
sell the idea to Tanaka.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.340
Oh, trust me.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.088
If I can do this,
I definitely can do that.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.903
Louis, what the hell
have you done?

21:53.395 --> 21:55.693
What? I'm setting up
for our meeting with Tanaka.

21:55.773 --> 21:56.820
Are you kidding me?

21:56.899 --> 21:58.071
<i>This isn't Gung Ho.</i>

21:58.150 --> 21:59.527
Louis, they're gonna
take one look at you,

21:59.652 --> 22:01.529
they're gonna run out the door.
No, they're not.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.456
Mike, Tanaka's a Japanese
company steeped in tradition.

22:04.532 --> 22:05.749
I don't care what
you think they are.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.167
This is offensive.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.495
There's absolutely
nothing offensive

22:08.577 --> 22:10.079
about showing respect
for another culture.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.414
And what do you know
about their culture?

22:11.497 --> 22:12.749
Mike, trust me.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.918
When I was in junior high, we had
an exchange student stay with us.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.921
(EXHALES) Suki.
Here we go.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.132
She was far from home
and proud of her culture,

22:21.215 --> 22:22.341
and she set up
everything in this room

22:22.424 --> 22:23.425
to make herself
feel comfortable,

22:23.509 --> 22:25.807
right down to giving
my father this very kimono

22:25.886 --> 22:27.354
and laying out a map
of her hometown.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.521
Louis, I want you
to listen to me.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.349
They are gonna be here
in 45 minutes,

22:30.432 --> 22:31.979
and if you are still
dressed like that

22:32.059 --> 22:33.527
and this room still
looks like this,

22:33.602 --> 22:35.525
Dominic is going
to fire us.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.696
They're not going to be
here in 45 minutes,

22:36.772 --> 22:37.898
'cause they're here
right now.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.447
Mr. Tanaka-san.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.080
TANAKA: Who did this?
LOUIS: I did.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.083
That is a map
of Shikoku.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.130
My family is from there.
I know.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.376
How?

22:57.459 --> 22:58.961
Because we do
our homework, sir,

22:59.587 --> 23:01.715
just like we did our
homework on this deal.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.801
I think we are going
to get along very nicely.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.103
Please.

23:09.513 --> 23:10.730
What are you doing?

23:11.640 --> 23:12.937
Get the tea.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.069
You want me to get the...
Yeah, get the tea.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.361
Okay.

23:28.157 --> 23:30.580
(IN FAKE FRENCH ACCENT) Oh, you
must be the future McMillans.

23:30.993 --> 23:33.542
I would say sorry I'm late,
but I am not sorry.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.378
So let us begin
discussing the details

23:36.457 --> 23:37.674
of your first wedding.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.252
I'm sorry.
You are?

23:39.335 --> 23:40.837
Oh, my name
is of no consequence.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.173
What is, is that my
company has taken over

23:43.255 --> 23:45.633
the planning service
of The Plaza Hotel.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.305
Here's our brochure.

23:47.843 --> 23:50.847
Mmm, I can see by
the look on your faces

23:50.930 --> 23:53.900
that bitch Patricia,
she did not tell you.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.146
Bitch? (SIGHS)

23:55.392 --> 23:56.644
We love Patricia.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.149
Well, she's no
longer with us.

23:58.228 --> 24:01.107
As I was saying, the menu
will no longer be optional.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.942
We'll be serving
Duck a I'Orange,

24:03.025 --> 24:04.698
escargot,
<i>et</i> foie gras.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.282
But we're vegan.

24:06.362 --> 24:07.488
What is that?

24:07.696 --> 24:08.948
It's...
It doesn't matter.

24:09.031 --> 24:10.157
We are French.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.958
You eat what we serve,
or you do not eat.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.252
Can we taste it?

24:14.328 --> 24:17.002
Oh, would you like me to
just show you my naked body

24:17.081 --> 24:20.506
before we go out to dinner and
you want to sleep with me?

24:21.001 --> 24:22.719
I need to go
to the restroom.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.096
Okay, so here's
what's gonna happen.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.301
She's gonna
want to drop me,

24:29.385 --> 24:30.807
and you're gonna drop
The Plaza Hotel.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.350
What?
Cut the shit, John.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.602
I did that so you
could have some cover.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.350
I did some checking,

24:36.433 --> 24:39.482
and you either need to change
the location of your wedding,

24:39.561 --> 24:41.404
or I'm gonna tell her
about your mistress.

24:42.773 --> 24:43.774
Yeah.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.367
Dr. Agard, when did Sam Tull
start seeing you as a patient?

24:52.449 --> 24:54.076
Approximately
six months ago.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.502
And why did he
start seeing you?

24:55.869 --> 24:58.543
He said his job
involved taking risks,

24:58.622 --> 25:00.124
and it was causing
him stress.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.384
LAWYER: So he wanted
to stop taking risks?

25:02.584 --> 25:03.756
No, he wanted
to continue.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.716
Oh, I get it.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.469
He wanted to continue
with the risks,

25:07.548 --> 25:09.016
he just wanted
to feel better about it.

25:09.091 --> 25:10.092
Yes.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.848
And were you able
to help him feel better

25:11.927 --> 25:13.270
about taking
these risks?

25:13.554 --> 25:15.101
Um, uh, we
made progress.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.274
Yes or no?
Yes.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.986
And after you helped him feel
good about taking risks,

25:21.186 --> 25:25.157
did he reveal that he then
lost $50 million on one trade?

25:27.443 --> 25:28.865
Dr. Agard,
you are under oath.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.241
And if you
will not answer,

25:30.404 --> 25:32.372
I will have a judge
compel you to answer.

25:32.740 --> 25:33.787
Yes.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.619
And how did he say he felt
about losing $50 million

25:36.702 --> 25:37.874
on one trade?

25:37.953 --> 25:39.751
He said he felt
guilty about it.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.379
So he came to you
to continue taking risks

25:42.458 --> 25:44.506
until he finally
lost $50 million

25:44.585 --> 25:45.711
and then admitted
to being guilty.

25:45.794 --> 25:46.920
That is not
what she said.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.802
I'm sorry,
he just felt guilty.

25:49.757 --> 25:50.849
You want to
drop this now,

25:50.924 --> 25:53.473
or do you want us to hand
this tape over to the SEC?

25:58.974 --> 26:01.568
Dr. Agard, did you want to give
the testimony you just gave?

26:01.643 --> 26:03.270
Of course not.
And why is that?

26:03.479 --> 26:04.731
Because I care
about my clients.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.190
HARVEY: ls it possible that
you didn't want to give it

26:06.315 --> 26:07.567
because it's not true?

26:07.858 --> 26:09.155
No, it's not possible.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.702
You couldn't possibly
have been pressured

26:10.778 --> 26:12.621
to give false testimony
against your wishes?

26:14.281 --> 26:15.658
No, I couldn't have.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.413
Have you ever been
pressured to do something

26:17.493 --> 26:19.336
you didn't want to do
by a client before?

26:20.996 --> 26:22.122
Let me rephrase.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.880
Isn't it true that you released
a client that you cared about

26:24.958 --> 26:26.835
from rehab
for no reason

26:26.919 --> 26:29.718
other than you felt pressure
from a different client,

26:29.797 --> 26:31.595
who was actually
paying the bills?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.638
Dr. Agard,
you're under oath,

26:33.717 --> 26:34.889
and if you will
not answer,

26:35.010 --> 26:37.183
I will have a judge
compel you to answer.

26:38.263 --> 26:39.264
Yes.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.982
And did this person
die of an overdose

26:41.058 --> 26:42.401
less than 24 hours later?

26:43.310 --> 26:44.402
Yes.

26:44.478 --> 26:45.946
HARVEY: So if you let
yourself be pressured

26:46.021 --> 26:47.147
when someone's
life is at risk,

26:47.231 --> 26:48.448
what's to make us think
you're not doing

26:48.524 --> 26:50.367
the exact same
thing right now'?

27:03.539 --> 27:05.416
You arrogant
piece of shit.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.217
Watch yourself.
This is my office.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.589
Well, I don't care
what it is.

27:08.669 --> 27:09.966
How dare you
betray me like that?

27:10.045 --> 27:12.047
I tried to warn you.
You didn't warn me.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.849
You asked me to lie for you,
and I told you I wouldn't.

27:13.924 --> 27:15.801
I asked you to lie
for Sam Tull...

27:15.884 --> 27:18.103
This isn't about Sam Tull,
and you know it.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.350
What the hell are
you talking about?

27:19.429 --> 27:22.148
I opened up to you so that
we could build trust,

27:22.224 --> 27:23.817
not so that you
could humiliate me.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.485
I humiliated you
to help a man

27:25.561 --> 27:26.858
you say you
care about.

27:26.937 --> 27:28.814
And our fighting about your mother
had nothing to do with that?

27:28.939 --> 27:30.657
Excuse me? You walked
out of our session,

27:30.732 --> 27:32.609
because you didn't want
to talk about your mother.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.411
And the second
you had the chance

27:34.528 --> 27:36.781
to permanently damage our
relationship, you took it.

27:36.864 --> 27:37.865
You're insane.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.499
And you're a
self-serving narcissist,

27:39.575 --> 27:41.543
who will do or say anything
to get what he wants.

27:41.618 --> 27:44.371
I did what I did in there
to protect my client. Oh.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.673
And I don't give a shit if it
hurt your feelings or not,

27:46.748 --> 27:47.965
because you
betrayed him

27:48.041 --> 27:49.543
just as much
as I'm betraying you.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.799
And you may be the one
who's crying about it,

27:51.879 --> 27:54.428
but he's the one who's been
accused of committing a crime.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.177
If you're lucky, someday
you're gonna realize

27:58.260 --> 28:00.888
what's really going on here,
and when that day comes,

28:00.971 --> 28:02.348
I hope you find
someone to help you,

28:02.431 --> 28:03.853
because it isn't
going to be me.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.779
Mike, put that coffee
down and check this out.

28:15.068 --> 28:17.321
It's a map of Scarsdale,
where I grew up.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.781
Tanaka returned
the favor.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.283
Actually, Louis,
I got that for you.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.627
You did? Why?

28:23.744 --> 28:25.712
Because you were right
and I was wrong,

28:25.787 --> 28:27.789
and as crazy
as it seems,

28:28.624 --> 28:30.501
you and I actually make
a pretty good team.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.387
Now all that's left is calling
Dominic to set up a meeting.

28:35.297 --> 28:37.425
Why don't you do it?
I can't.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.884
I got to go
hang my map-

28:44.514 --> 28:46.312
Dominic, what are
you doing here?

28:46.808 --> 28:48.025
I was just about
to call you.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.318
To say what, that you
blew up my deal?

28:49.394 --> 28:50.862
Because I already know.
What?

28:50.938 --> 28:52.861
That's right. Range Tech
called me after they heard

28:52.940 --> 28:54.533
that I was negotiating
with another company.

28:54.608 --> 28:57.452
Problem is, I wasn't negotiating
with another company.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.996
My lawyers were,
without my consent.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.289
Okay, calm down,
Dominic.

29:01.365 --> 29:02.662
There was a problem
with Range Tech.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.836
I told you that I didn't want
there to be any problems!

29:05.911 --> 29:07.083
Well, if you'd
bought them,

29:07.162 --> 29:08.914
their problems were gonna
become your problems.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.920
But just calm down
and take a second,

29:10.999 --> 29:12.421
because we brought
you a solution.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.753
Which is what?

29:13.835 --> 29:15.508
Mike, don't call Dominic.
Tanaka pulled out.

29:16.004 --> 29:17.221
DOMINIC: Pulled
out of what?

29:19.383 --> 29:20.635
It doesn't matter.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.014
You're both fired.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.689
Harvey, I need to talk to you.
Not now, Rachel.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.566
Sam Tull's been arrested. What?

29:31.645 --> 29:34.023
Gilroy's lawyer gave
formal notice to the SEC.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.571
They won't pay the fine under
any circumstance. God damn it.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.618
Gretchen, get Paul Gilroy
on the phone.

29:38.694 --> 29:39.695
Harvey, what are
you gonna do?

29:39.820 --> 29:41.572
Tull can't go to prison for this.
No one's going to prison.

29:41.655 --> 29:44.283
But how do you now that? We didn't think
he'd be arrested in the first place.

29:44.366 --> 29:45.367
I don't care
what we thought.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.202
It's not gonna happen because
I'm not letting it happen.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.459
I've got Mr. Gilroy
on line one.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.875
Are you out of your mind?
You contacted the SEC?

29:52.958 --> 29:54.255
<i>PAUL: They contacted me.</i>

29:54.376 --> 29:56.925
And I'm not the one who filed a
malicious prosecution lawsuit.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.467
No, you're the one
who got his ass kicked

29:58.547 --> 30:00.925
in a deposition then turned
around and asked for more.

30:01.008 --> 30:03.181
<i>I didn't get my ass
kicked, Mr. Specter.</i>

30:03.260 --> 30:05.809
That idiot therapist did, and
she no longer works for us.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.314
<i>But you still
don't have any proof</i>

30:07.389 --> 30:09.858
<i>that I authorized those
trades, and you never will.</i>

30:09.933 --> 30:11.776
So I suggest
you stop harassing me

30:11.852 --> 30:14.275
and focus on getting
your client out of jail.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.574
You heard the man.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.526
We're dropping
the lawsuit?

30:19.609 --> 30:20.952
No, we're doubling
the damages.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.245
Get it done.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.035
You son of a bitch.
You set us up.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.583
I'm sorry, Louis, I have no
idea what you're talking about.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.999
Oh, bullshit. You told
Tanaka not to make a deal.

30:33.081 --> 30:34.082
Yes, I did.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.505
At first, it looked
like a good idea,

30:36.585 --> 30:37.882
but then I did
my due diligence,

30:37.961 --> 30:39.838
and Io and behold,
it didn't.

30:39.921 --> 30:42.549
Was that before or after you
leaked our meeting to Range Tech?

30:42.632 --> 30:43.884
I have to say,
I'm appalled.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.810
I mean, after you've
been so aboveboard

30:45.886 --> 30:47.308
in all your
dealings with me,

30:47.387 --> 30:49.014
to think that I would
go behind your back

30:49.097 --> 30:51.566
and leak news of that meeting
with no possible chance

30:51.641 --> 30:53.234
of it being linked
back to me,

30:53.310 --> 30:54.357
that's really offensive.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.063
It is linked back
to you, plain as day.

30:56.146 --> 30:58.114
Then I guess you two must
have some sort of proof,

30:58.190 --> 31:01.945
because if you don't, you can walk
yourselves the hell out of my office.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.907
It's one thing for you
to have your feud with me,

31:06.365 --> 31:09.289
but you just cost your firm
a huge piece of business.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.667
Let me explain to you
what I already told him.

31:12.954 --> 31:15.707
This isn't about business.
It's about getting even.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.648
Harvey, do you
have a minute?

31:32.015 --> 31:33.858
If you're here to tell me
to drop that countersuit...

31:33.934 --> 31:35.311
I'm not telling you
to drop anything.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.488
I'm just saying in addition
to attacking Gilroy,

31:37.562 --> 31:39.781
we should be getting proof
that Sam got the authorization

31:39.856 --> 31:41.574
for those trades.
We don't have any proof.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.323
We can if we get some
of the other traders

31:43.402 --> 31:44.574
to come forward
and say how it went.

31:44.653 --> 31:45.905
They'll never
testify to that.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.410
Harvey, that therapist
was the company therapist.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.208
Those traders saw her
on a regular basis

31:50.283 --> 31:51.660
to keep their
shit together.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.336
So, if Sam opened up
to her about work,

31:53.495 --> 31:55.247
then some of the other
traders must have too.

31:55.330 --> 31:56.422
She can't speak to that.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.132
Of course she can.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.461
If Tull waived privilege, then
they all did. You know that.

32:00.544 --> 32:02.091
It doesn't matter.
You saw what I did to her.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.217
She's not gonna
want to help us.

32:03.296 --> 32:04.297
It's not about
helping us.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.470
It's about helping
her client.

32:05.549 --> 32:06.675
I can't ask her
to do that.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.601
Why not?
Because I can't.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.348
Harvey, what's going on?
Nothing's going on.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.523
How did you know those things
about her in that deposition?

32:17.811 --> 32:18.812
Because I did.

32:18.895 --> 32:19.942
Does it have something
to do with the fact

32:20.021 --> 32:22.194
that you've been having panic attacks
and that she's your therapist?

32:22.274 --> 32:24.493
Because if it does... Okay.
This conversation is over.

32:24.568 --> 32:26.445
Look, I am not trying
to butt into things

32:26.528 --> 32:29.281
that don't concern me,
but this isn't about you.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.625
This is about keeping
Sam Tull out of prison.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.012
What the hell
are you doing here?

32:53.597 --> 32:54.644
You two don't work
for me anymore.

32:54.723 --> 32:55.815
Just give us
a minute to explain.

32:55.891 --> 32:57.017
There's nothing
to explain.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.977
You blew up my deal
and ruined a friendship,

32:59.060 --> 33:00.277
because you thought
you knew better than me.

33:00.353 --> 33:01.400
We do know better
than you.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.857
You're an arrogant
son of a bitch.

33:02.939 --> 33:05.488
Dominic, this is a draft
of a class-action lawsuit

33:05.567 --> 33:06.784
headed Range Tech's way

33:06.902 --> 33:08.779
the second the EPA's
report comes out.

33:09.196 --> 33:11.824
That's the same report that
your friend kept buried.

33:11.907 --> 33:14.160
And if you'd bought them, that suit
would have been headed your way.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.334
So, yes, we
blew up the deal,

33:15.410 --> 33:16.457
but that man was
never your friend.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.504
You lied to me,
and worse than that,

33:18.580 --> 33:19.672
you didn't respect me.

33:19.748 --> 33:21.921
lam sorry. I shouldn't
have antagonized you.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.798
And I shouldn't have said that
rushing through this deal

33:23.877 --> 33:25.424
without doing due
diligence was feasible.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.177
You see, the bottom line is,
is that we were both right

33:27.255 --> 33:28.677
when we tried to do
this deal with Tanaka.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.555
And now that we've got
nothing to hide from you,

33:30.634 --> 33:33.137
there is nothing to stop us
from finding you someone else.

33:36.431 --> 33:38.308
So, instead of standing
here kissing my ass,

33:38.391 --> 33:40.268
why don't you get
to work doing that?

33:50.278 --> 33:52.030
If you're here to apologize,
I'm not interested.

33:52.113 --> 33:53.285
I'm not here
to apologize.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.538
I'm here because I need
to look at your files.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.585
There really is no end
to your arrogance.

33:57.661 --> 33:59.038
I wouldn't ask
if this wasn't

33:59.120 --> 34:00.667
the only way to keep
Sam out of prison.

34:00.914 --> 34:02.416
I'm not giving you
Sam Tull's file.

34:02.499 --> 34:03.671
And I'm not
asking for it.

34:03.750 --> 34:06.378
I want to see all the files
of the other traders you saw.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.553
Are you out
of your mind?

34:07.629 --> 34:10.929
No, I'm not. They all signed
the same waiver Sam did.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.886
Some of them must have admitted
the way it works at Butler,

34:13.969 --> 34:15.471
and it's in your notes.

34:16.638 --> 34:18.106
Let me see if I have
my facts straight.

34:18.181 --> 34:21.560
You eviscerate me,
justify it,

34:21.685 --> 34:23.232
and then waltz back here
as if nothing happened.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.734
I know something happened,
but now is not the time.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.942
You mean now is not the time
as long as you need a favor.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.822
Oh, God damn it, you're
not doing me a favor.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.824
You're helping your
patient, the one you said

34:31.902 --> 34:34.076
you went to see three different
lawyers to keep from betraying.

34:34.155 --> 34:35.748
And if you hadn't
betrayed me,

34:35.824 --> 34:37.621
you wouldn't be in this
position right now.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.078
What do you want me
to say'? I'm sorry?

34:39.159 --> 34:40.411
As a matter of fact, I do.

34:40.495 --> 34:42.246
You think I wanted
to depose you like that?

34:42.330 --> 34:43.422
It made me sick.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.250
I hated every
goddamn second of it,

34:45.333 --> 34:48.553
because I know all you've
been trying to do is help me,

34:48.628 --> 34:50.596
and the only reason
I didn't apologize before

34:50.672 --> 34:53.425
is because if I knew
it kept Sam out of prison,

34:53.507 --> 34:54.885
I'd do it all again.

35:00.181 --> 35:01.728
Now, are you
gonna help me?

35:03.893 --> 35:05.861
Harvey, even if
I wanted to help you,

35:05.937 --> 35:08.031
it doesn't say those
things in my files.

35:08.398 --> 35:09.570
I need them anyway.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.113
I just told you they
don't have what you need.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.865
I know that,
and you know that,

35:12.986 --> 35:14.238
but they don't
know that.

35:14.321 --> 35:15.994
You're gonna try
and bluff them?

35:16.197 --> 35:17.198
It won't work.

35:17.324 --> 35:18.746
You saw what I did
in there to you,

35:19.200 --> 35:21.294
and that was something
I didn't want to do.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.872
Trust me, they won't
know what hit 'em.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.339
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

35:31.338 --> 35:32.681
We get fired by
McKernon Motors,

35:32.756 --> 35:34.599
and you didn't tell me
and you didn't tell Harvey?

35:34.674 --> 35:35.971
Wait, Jessica...
God damn it.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.145
We didn't tell anyone
because we were fired

35:38.219 --> 35:39.892
for less than a day,
and then we fixed it.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.188
Oh, you fixed it?

35:41.264 --> 35:42.481
Yes, it was all
a misunderstanding.

35:42.557 --> 35:43.524
Now Dominic's
back on board.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.977
I don't give a shit that
Dominic is back on board

35:45.060 --> 35:46.687
and neither does
Fletcher Engines.

35:46.770 --> 35:47.817
Fletcher Engines?
That's right.

35:47.896 --> 35:50.149
In the "less than a day" that
you were fired by McKernon,

35:50.231 --> 35:52.233
Jack Soloff signed
Fletcher <i>as</i> a client,

35:52.317 --> 35:53.660
and now I have
to let McKernon go.

35:53.735 --> 35:54.736
That son of a bitch.

35:54.819 --> 35:55.991
Jessica, he set
this whole thing up.

35:56.071 --> 35:57.573
Oh, and I'm sure you did
nothing to antagonize him.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.159
I did do nothing.
I swear, I wasn't petty.

36:00.241 --> 36:01.834
I trusted him, and then
he used that trust

36:01.910 --> 36:03.036
to stab us in the back.

36:03.119 --> 36:05.998
Jessica, you have no idea. Louis has
never been more right in his life.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.833
You can't dump McKernon.
It'll kill Harvey.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.714
Well, we can't goddamn
represent them now,

36:09.793 --> 36:12.342
and you know it. We can if you
tell Jack he has to drop Fletcher.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.047
JESSICA: Do you realize the
position you're putting me in?

36:14.214 --> 36:16.967
Fletcher is worth three
times what McKernon is.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.848
LOUIS: I'm sorry you're in
this position right now,

36:18.927 --> 36:21.350
but for once, I'm not
the one who put you in it.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.102
Jack Soloff is.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.322
DONNA: Dinner is served.

36:40.407 --> 36:44.628
I guess that means you got Opie
his bridal gift after all.

36:44.703 --> 36:45.875
I did.

36:46.204 --> 36:49.174
And I shouldn't have been so
standoffish with you in the file room.

36:50.125 --> 36:53.470
Well, maybe I shouldn't have had
that be our first interaction.

36:53.795 --> 36:56.218
No, that's not on you.
That's on me.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.013
I never welcomed you to the
firm, and I should have.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.230
You know, when I was
a young mother,

37:04.431 --> 37:06.604
first week of school, every clay
I dropped my little girl off.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.526
When I left,
she cried.

37:10.103 --> 37:13.323
Friday came, I left,
she didn't cry.

37:14.149 --> 37:15.150
So I did.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.701
What are you saying?

37:18.778 --> 37:20.621
You didn't welcome
me to the firm

37:20.697 --> 37:23.667
because you weren't ready to
see your little girl move on.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.787
Are you saying Harvey
is my little girl?

37:27.162 --> 37:29.381
I'm saying you weren't
ready to move on.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.627
You're all right,
Gretchen.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.764
Hope you like French.

37:43.470 --> 37:44.562
Harvey.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.103
You know, you didn't have
to schedule an appointment

37:48.183 --> 37:49.605
just to tell me
how it turned out.

37:49.809 --> 37:52.278
I scheduled an appointment
to give you these.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.191
Thank you very much.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.160
They're from Sam Tull.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.037
Did you get me anything?

38:02.739 --> 38:03.911
I did.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.077
I'm ready to talk
about my mother.

38:14.167 --> 38:15.669
(SIGHS)

38:16.002 --> 38:17.595
<i>I want to hold her</i>

38:18.004 --> 38:19.551
<i>I want to kiss her</i>

38:19.881 --> 38:21.053
RACHEL: This is beautiful.

38:21.257 --> 38:24.010
Why did... I wanted to
celebrate a special occasion.

38:24.219 --> 38:25.892
What's the special
occasion?

38:29.432 --> 38:32.686
I got us
The Plaza Hotel

38:32.977 --> 38:34.604
on your birthday.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.069
For our wedding?

38:37.440 --> 38:38.566
Yeah.

38:40.777 --> 38:42.074
(LAUGHS)

38:42.904 --> 38:45.327
Oh, that is the sweetest
thing you've done

38:45.406 --> 38:46.498
since you asked me
to marry you.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.700
No, it's the sweetest
thing I've done

38:47.784 --> 38:49.377
until the next thing I do.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.705
Oh, Mike.
Mmm.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.961
I mean, how
did you do it?

38:54.040 --> 38:55.041
That must have
been impossible.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.501
No, it was
a piece of cake.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.511
You went to Donna,
didn't you?

38:58.586 --> 39:00.259
That's why it was
a piece of cake.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.174
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

39:02.257 --> 39:06.103
<i>I want to take her for a ride

39:08.513 --> 39:09.514
<i>Yeah, hey</i>

39:16.229 --> 39:17.731
(CLEARS THROAT)

39:18.064 --> 39:19.486
Jessica, what are you
doing here so late?

39:19.566 --> 39:21.034
I didn't get a chance
to congratulate you

39:21.109 --> 39:22.486
on signing Fletcher Engines.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.529
Hey, good news
travels fast.

39:24.612 --> 39:27.536
Yes, it does, and you're going
to drop them even faster.

39:27.949 --> 39:29.371
I take it this has
something to do

39:29.450 --> 39:31.373
with our long-standing
relationship

39:31.452 --> 39:32.453
with McKernon Motors.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.631
You know damn well
what this has to do with.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.423
I know that my client

39:36.499 --> 39:39.594
is the fourth-largest engine
manufacturer in the country.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.262
And if you had
landed them like a man,

39:41.504 --> 39:43.598
I'd be the first one in here
with a bottle of champagne.

39:43.673 --> 39:46.392
But you did it by putting a
shiv in your fellow attorneys.

39:46.467 --> 39:48.390
So this, it's how
it's going to be.

39:48.469 --> 39:49.686
And by
"fellow attorneys,"

39:49.804 --> 39:51.397
don't you really
mean "Harvey?"

39:51.472 --> 39:52.473
Watch yourself, Jack,

39:52.640 --> 39:54.859
and drop Fletcher Engines
by morning.

39:55.310 --> 39:57.108
If you don't, I will.

39:57.270 --> 39:58.647
By morning it is.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.693
And by afternoon, the
entire firm's gonna know

40:02.775 --> 40:05.028
that you chose a mid-size
client over Fletcher,

40:05.111 --> 40:08.285
because Harvey Specter
has an attachment to them

40:10.241 --> 40:12.118
and you have
an attachment to him.

40:13.786 --> 40:16.289
I admire people
who challenge me, Jack.

40:18.041 --> 40:21.887
But there's a limit to that,
and you are on the very edge.

40:22.462 --> 40:23.884
So let me be clear.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.842
This is your last chance
to work with me.

40:28.343 --> 40:30.516
Take it, and you
have a future.

40:30.678 --> 40:34.683
Don't, and you can go ask
Daniel Hardman for a job,

40:34.766 --> 40:36.313
because we both know that's
how you got the idea

40:36.392 --> 40:37.985
for Fletcher Engines
in the first place.
