I can't believe
I finally got you
to a family shoot.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.120
You're going to love it.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.760
Hmm, yeah,
although, I think
I've got food poisoning.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.200
I might have had
a dodgy prawn.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.400
Royals don't have
dodgy prawns.

00:31.480 --> 00:32.920
That's what
the tasters are for.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.960
Well, all right.
The truth is,
I think shooting is wrong.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.960
But before we got married,
you said you hunted
the whole time.

00:40.040 --> 00:44.000
Yes, as a young Gypsy,
I enjoyed nothing more than
dragging hedgehogs.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.160
But that was to eat.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.480
We eat everything we shoot.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.000
A thousand pheasants?

00:48.080 --> 00:49.480
I'm certainly going to have
at least one.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.880
Anyway, what's so wrong
with one family killing
a 1,000 birds in a day

00:51.960 --> 00:54.040
-for no reason whatsoever?
-You should know,

00:54.120 --> 00:56.440
you're the co-founder
of United for Wildlife.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.280
Don't you think that's a bit
inconsistent?

00:58.360 --> 00:59.800
I hope you're not suggesting
that in my head,

00:59.880 --> 01:01.800
animals have some sort of
minimum height requirement

01:01.880 --> 01:03.480
below which
they're all right to shoot?

01:03.760 --> 01:04.720
Of course not.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.200
And I will come
on the shoot,
but I'll just watch.

01:07.280 --> 01:11.320
Look, Kate, I love you,
but if you're going to fit
into this family,

01:11.400 --> 01:12.400
you better kill something.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.640
What's with
the shepherd's crook?

01:18.720 --> 01:20.000
It's a symbol.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.200
I'm shepherd
to the people of Britain

01:22.280 --> 01:25.720
and you ever by my side,
are my trusty dog.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.440
You really need
to see someone.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.400
I'm not seeing
another psychiatrist.

01:29.480 --> 01:33.160
A stylist or someone who can
drag you into the 1950s.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.680
I'm more modern than you.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.240
At least I can
operate a toaster.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.520
The main reason
I married you

01:37.600 --> 01:39.320
is so I wouldn't have to
operate a toaster.

01:41.080 --> 01:43.920
You're late! I'm not running
a hotel here.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.520
I know, that would involve
turning on the heating.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.960
It's not my fault you
haven't taken the precaution
of sewing yourself

01:49.040 --> 01:50.440
into your winter underwear.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.400
Hessian.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.320
I bid you good morning.
I have...

01:57.400 --> 01:59.720
Things to attend to.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.960
-Be the best you you can be.
-Stop talking, start doing.

02:06.040 --> 02:07.280
With the fig
are you on about?

02:07.360 --> 02:09.000
Sorry, can't stay.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.639
We just got jobs.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.440
We're motivational speakers.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.800
Motivating people
to do what, top themselves?

02:14.880 --> 02:16.720
No, no, no, no,
I think it's admirable.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.120
I've always tried to inspire
Britain's youth.

02:19.200 --> 02:22.680
It was after hearing me that
Tim Peake decided to become
an astronaut.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.360
-Really?
-Well, I can't be sure,

02:24.440 --> 02:25.760
but why else
would he have done it?

02:25.840 --> 02:27.560
We're addressing
workers in management

02:27.640 --> 02:30.360
at South Wales'
last remaining steel works.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.880
Which is so great because
we've always wanted Britain

02:32.960 --> 02:35.520
to have a wider
manufacturing base.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.120
I've always thought
the Royal skill set
waving from balconies,

02:39.200 --> 02:40.760
cutting ribbons and so forth

02:40.840 --> 02:43.920
perfectly qualifies us
to give advice to everybody.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.680
Especially heavy industry.

02:45.760 --> 02:46.760
BOTH: Exactly.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.680
Kate! You're here
for the shoot.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.400
I thought it was
against your principles.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.000
I'm here to support
my husband.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.520
You're a bit touchy today.

03:15.600 --> 03:19.200
Sounds like someone's
in a tizz about the prospect
of fucking up small animals.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.520
Shut up, Pippa.
Shut up!

03:22.560 --> 03:25.040
Harry, I've been looking
for you.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.480
I found this the other day.
You must have left it
when we were...

03:27.560 --> 03:28.960
Bonking each other's
brains out.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.600
In a relationship.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.480
Queen Mother gave me this
for my eighth birthday.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.680
Harry, do you ever
think about
our time together?

03:37.760 --> 03:40.640
Sometimes. It's always good
to have something
in the spank bank.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.560
Ah, Harry.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.120
Got any more nightclubs
that I can turn into
office blocks?

03:46.200 --> 03:47.960
You cheated me
out of that nightclub.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.160
You knew I couldn't read
when you gave me
that contract.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.200
I saw a weakness
and I exploited it.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.240
It wasn't just me
you cheated,
it was a whole community.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.560
Because of you,
there's now just

03:56.680 --> 03:58.960
eight members-only
nightclubs
in South Kensington.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.600
They're just
statistics to me.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.680
Necessary stepping stones
to get what I really want.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.680
A shitload of money.

04:05.760 --> 04:06.840
Right.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.160
Let's take this outside.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.520
Wait. Strike him with this.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.280
Ah! Thanks, Auntie Anne.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.200
It's like that, is it?

04:17.279 --> 04:18.519
Name the time and place.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.560
Round the back, after tea.

04:20.640 --> 04:21.920
All right, but you do
realize I was

04:22.000 --> 04:24.640
small ball pistol champ
at Uppingham
four years in a row?

04:24.720 --> 04:25.760
What's that got
to do with anything?

04:25.840 --> 04:29.480
You just challenged him
to a duel.

04:29.560 --> 04:34.200
-What?
-Pistols, live ammunition,
death.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.120
I've got to be honest, Anne,
that sounds a bit dangerous.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.120
Well, you can't back out
now, the family honor
is at stake.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.640
Yeah, but couldn't he just
buy me a pint?

04:43.720 --> 04:46.040
Johnny, call it off.
This is madness.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.240
I'm sorry Pippa,
but you knew
I was a psychopath

04:48.320 --> 04:49.480
when you agreed to marry me.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.760
Do think I do all those
Iron Man runs
because I'm normal?

04:52.840 --> 04:54.240
Yeah, look,
I hate to do this

04:54.320 --> 04:57.480
because I was really looking
forward to being shot at
by a marksman

04:57.560 --> 05:00.840
but I've got to go.
I've got a thing.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.520
You're not going anywhere,
Harry.

05:21.880 --> 05:25.680
-Oh, it opens that way?
-Dad?

05:25.760 --> 05:29.920
No, Wills, I'm your father's
identical twin brother,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.360
imprisoned here
at Sandringham
for 68 years.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.360
So you've been in here
your whole life?

05:40.440 --> 05:41.840
How did you learn
to speak English?

05:41.920 --> 05:46.080
From Radio Four.
Dogger, Fisher,
German Bight.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.600
Gosh, that's amazing. The answer to your
next question is

05:50.680 --> 05:52.920
I am the elder twin
by two minutes.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.640
And thus the rightful heir.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.200
How did you know
I was thinking that?

05:56.280 --> 05:59.640
Locked away alone,
all my senses
became highly acute.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.720
Most of all
my emotional sense.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.640
I've evolved into
what I believe is known
as a super empath.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.320
The exact opposite
of my father.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.600
Emotionally, Dad's
a bit fucked up.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.840
Sorry, you wouldn't have
heard swear words
on Radio Four.

06:12.920 --> 06:16.400
Ha, you'd be surprised
what they let go
on the Today program.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.600
Anyway, he was the one who
was meant to be locked up.

06:19.800 --> 06:23.160
Even as a baby,
he was considered
a social embarrassment.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.400
So there was a mistake,
then?

06:24.480 --> 06:26.920
Yes, Princess Margaret
was in charge that day

06:27.000 --> 06:29.200
and she'd been drinking
rather heavily.

06:29.280 --> 06:32.600
Sorry, I still can't believe
that bloody door.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.840
So all I had to do was pull?

06:34.920 --> 06:35.960
Yeah.

06:36.440 --> 06:39.720
-Could you wait here?
-You're going to see
your father, aren't you?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.040
Damn right.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.400
And the answer to
your other question is, no,

06:44.480 --> 06:46.800
I've never had sex
with a lady.

06:46.880 --> 06:48.640
Sorry, that was rude.

06:58.440 --> 06:59.440
Fuck.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.800
As you know, we were hoping
to have Richard Branson
speak to us,

07:07.880 --> 07:10.760
but as it turns out,
he's too expensive,

07:10.840 --> 07:13.480
but as a more-than-adequate
replacement,

07:13.560 --> 07:18.560
we have Princesses Beatrice
and Eugenie who are here
to talk to us about...

07:19.800 --> 07:21.280
Sorry, what's your speech
about again, love?

07:21.360 --> 07:23.800
Making it happen
in the Internet age.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.120
You know
this is a steelworks, right?

07:26.200 --> 07:28.360
-Yes.
-Right.

07:30.040 --> 07:34.960
Um... So, uh, please welcome
Beatrice and Eugenie.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.680
Hello, Port Talbot!

07:39.760 --> 07:41.560
Make some noise!

07:41.920 --> 07:43.280

07:44.720 --> 07:46.120
So where are y'all from?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.360

Amazing.

07:50.960 --> 07:55.200
Here's our top ten tips for
"insert nature
of business here".

07:55.280 --> 07:56.200
Making steel.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.720
So you're in the coffee shop
with your BFFs

07:59.800 --> 08:03.120
having a Thai bubble tea
and you're spitballing,

08:03.200 --> 08:06.960
"How can we use the Internet
to make steel?"

08:07.040 --> 08:08.160
Am I right?

08:08.440 --> 08:10.800
Well, mainly you need
heat and iron ore.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.720
The Internet
doesn't really come into it.

08:12.800 --> 08:13.960
Yes, but with the Internet,

08:14.040 --> 08:16.520
you could turn the machines
on from your smartphones

08:16.600 --> 08:18.320
so you wouldn't
need workers.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.560
Also, you could use an app
to outsource your admin,

08:23.640 --> 08:25.640
so you wouldn't
need managers.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.000
So, top tip number two.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.558
[suspenseful music playing]

08:42.320 --> 08:43.360

08:45.480 --> 08:46.600

08:47.280 --> 08:48.600
He got out!

08:51.400 --> 08:52.560
Charles!

08:53.000 --> 08:54.520
Have you done something
to your hair?

08:54.600 --> 08:57.480
Oh, yeah,
it's a new shampoo.

08:57.560 --> 08:58.640
You're Kate, aren't you?

08:58.720 --> 09:01.360
-Of course I am.
-I sense pain.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.400
You're worried about killing
all those small birds

09:04.480 --> 09:08.640
and also you've got a crush
on Ryan Gosling
from <i>La La Land.</i>

09:08.720 --> 09:10.920
Oh, he was just
so passionate about jazz.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.200
Oh, it's all right, Kate.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.560
I don't like
killing birds either.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.600
Unless one's flown down
the chimney and I can have
an extra snack.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.520
-What?
-Nothing.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.920
We should cancel the shoot.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.240
Oh, that's wonderful.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.320
Do you know, I don't think
we've ever had a hug.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.600
I always thought
you were rather cold.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.440
Oh, quite the opposite.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.520
I ought to be going.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.440
Feeding time!

09:44.520 --> 09:45.520
Who want a biccie?

09:50.120 --> 09:51.360
Feeding time!

09:52.280 --> 09:54.760
Charles, what have you done
to your hair?

09:54.840 --> 09:57.760
Oh, erm,
it's this new shampoo.

09:57.840 --> 09:58.840
What are you wearing?

10:00.080 --> 10:02.680
You've taken my advice,
haven't you?

10:02.760 --> 10:03.760
Yes.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.960
You're in the mood for sex,
aren't you?

10:07.920 --> 10:10.320
I've got ten minutes before
the pubs open, why not?

10:10.400 --> 10:13.120
Look, there is something
I should tell you, I...

10:15.080 --> 10:16.760
-What?
-Nothing!

10:18.240 --> 10:20.400
It's been great
talking to you, Meghan,

10:20.480 --> 10:22.800
and if I never
see you again,

10:22.880 --> 10:24.880
remember
I'll always love you.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.440
Harry, I've got
a car outside.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.200
We can sneak down
the back staircase.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.600
No, I'm staying.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.080
Auntie Anne
explained it all to me,

10:34.160 --> 10:36.720
how it's better to die
with honor
than live with shame.

10:36.800 --> 10:39.720
You can't fight a duel
for the honor
of the House of Windsor,

10:39.800 --> 10:41.240
not when
<i>It's A Royal Knockout</i>

10:41.360 --> 10:43.560
is still available
on YouTube, and besides,

10:43.640 --> 10:45.160
you weren't worried about
all that honor stuff

10:45.240 --> 10:47.760
when you were
photographed in Vegas
with your knackers out.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.160
That was different,
that was a party.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.360
This is just my life.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.040
Well, you won't be
able to go to any parties
if you're dead.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.480
Even if that were true,
it still wouldn't
change my mind.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.760
-But that's insane.
Johnny will kill you.
-Don't be so sure.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.400
I'm a pretty good shot
myself.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.440
See?

11:08.520 --> 11:10.040
Getting closer.

11:10.120 --> 11:15.600
And that's how you can use
Instagram to really boost
your...

11:15.680 --> 11:17.280
Steel productivity.

11:17.360 --> 11:21.720
Okay, that's all from us.
Later, guys.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.760
Wow. What a rush!

11:24.960 --> 11:26.280
How are we going to
come down from that?

11:26.360 --> 11:28.400
Yeah, it's like a drug.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.600
As I say, Richard Branson
was too expensive.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.680
Dad!

11:35.760 --> 11:37.200
Daddy?

11:37.360 --> 11:38.480
Where are you?

11:40.080 --> 11:43.120
Now is the winter
of our discontent.

11:43.240 --> 11:44.240
Richard, the third.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.240
You do realize if you reveal
the existence
of your father's twin,

11:47.320 --> 11:50.600
he will become king
and that will destroy
your father?

11:50.680 --> 11:53.280
I hadn't thought about that.
What should I do?

11:53.360 --> 11:55.720
Keep your uncle locked up
in the tower.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.600
-But that's illegal.
-It was illegal when
I locked up the princes.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.240
It wasn't the Middle Ages.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.080
It was the Middle Ages.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.840
Well, it's not when
you're in it, is it?

12:04.920 --> 12:06.080
It's the present.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.280
Thank you,
Richard the third. You've made
my mind up for me.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.840
Oh, so you are going to lock
your uncle up? No, I'm going to
make him king.

12:13.240 --> 12:15.040
Wills, there you are!

12:15.120 --> 12:17.920
I just ran into your dad,
who said we should cancel
the shoot,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.320
then he gave me the longest,
warmest hug ever.

12:21.880 --> 12:22.880
That wasn't Dad!

12:22.960 --> 12:25.000
That was his
identical twin brother
who the family have kept locked up
for the last 68 years.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.480
-Of course!
-Come on!

12:33.400 --> 12:36.280
That was so urgent.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.040
Almost as if you hadn't had
sex for years.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.320
Yes.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.280
And you knew
everything I wanted
before I knew myself,

12:43.360 --> 12:45.200
and you weren't reading
a gardening book.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.320
That's right, Camilla.
I'm not your husband.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.360
I thought an identical twin
was merely a legend...

12:54.480 --> 12:56.680
And there were just
big squirrels in the loft.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.840
I'm sorry,
I should have told you,

12:58.920 --> 13:01.200
but when I saw how
alluring you were, I...

since offering one of my
kidneys to a small girl,

You must have realized
you were having sex
with a different man.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.240
It was odd at the end

13:41.320 --> 13:43.520
when you didn't shout,
"Alternative medicine!"

13:43.600 --> 13:46.560
And you must have known...
Everyone knows
I'm married to Camilla.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.920
We're Charmilla. Come on. Come on!

13:49.360 --> 13:50.600
Let's get you back
to the attic.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.960
-Who wants a biccy?
-Have you been
feeding him dog biscuits? -Well, that's what I eat.
-Yes, back in the attic
with you.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.320
No. He's the rightful heir.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.560
You little bastard.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.760
Calm, darling.
We've all had a drink.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.640
I've trained all my life
to be King.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.080
But he'd be so much better
than you. How can that be possible?

14:05.600 --> 14:06.960
Think of all the fetes
I've opened.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.480
Because who could be
more sensitive

14:08.560 --> 14:10.280
to the peoples' needs
than a super empath?

14:10.360 --> 14:12.600
Plus, you like shooting,
but you believe
in reincarnation.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.040
What if you come back
as a pheasant?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.280
Pheasant? The worst
I'd get is leopard.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.960
Camilla, where do you stand
on all this?

14:18.040 --> 14:20.520
Well, I stand with you,
of course.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.080
Exactly. And besides,

14:22.160 --> 14:25.440
if he was made king
and people found out we kept
him locked in an attic,

14:25.520 --> 14:27.080
they'd think
we were all insane.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.400
-Which we're not.
-Look, why don't we discuss
this later, after the shoot?

14:30.480 --> 14:32.840
Right, back to the
attic while we decide
what to do with you.

14:32.920 --> 14:36.320
No, Anne. He should come
with us and see nature
for the first time,

14:36.400 --> 14:37.520
and us killing it.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.520
Just a moment.
There's something you
don't know about Charles.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.840
His health is... failing.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.120
It seems very unlikely
he'll meet the predicted
Windsor's life span of 150.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.400
Oh, no. How long's he got?

14:54.520 --> 14:55.600
Months.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.480
Days.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.680
So, when the sad moment
finally comes,

15:00.760 --> 15:03.360
you could simply...
fill his boots.

15:03.440 --> 15:04.920
The public need never know.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.400
That was absolute shite.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.880
Ugh... How can they be
motivational speakers

15:10.960 --> 15:13.200
when they've never done
a day's work in their lives?

15:13.280 --> 15:15.840
Telling us
how to manufacture steel.

15:15.920 --> 15:16.600
Eh...

15:17.640 --> 15:19.360
We're actually agreeing
on something.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.720
[Welsh choir sings]

15:21.040 --> 15:22.880
How about we put
our differences behind us

compete with the Chinese?

15:25.960 --> 15:27.160
Huh?

15:27.240 --> 15:28.360
Deal.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.520
They think we're twats.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.080
The only thing
they could agree on
is how terrible we are.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.040
But that's great!

15:40.120 --> 15:42.080
We've got them

We're not absolute shite.

-That's why we're all here.

Oh, the shoot.
Yah, I've got to
sort something out first,

16:05.320 --> 16:07.440

twin brother.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.640
Ah, but isn't that exactly
what a robot would say?

16:27.880 --> 16:32.640
No. A robot would say,
"What is this emotion
called love?"

But that's what Dad says
all the time.

about escaping.

this time together.

22:12.480 --> 22:13.720
No!

22:13.800 --> 22:15.680
But we'd only just
got to know him.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.800
It's not just
a tragedy for us.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.040
It's a tragedy
for Great Britain
and Northern Ireland.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.640
No, Wills.
We can learn from him.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.120
Bring his sensitivity
and wisdom
to our reigns,

22:26.360 --> 22:28.880
so that he can live on
through us...

22:28.960 --> 22:31.000
Through me,
and then through you...

22:31.960 --> 22:33.120
But me first!

22:33.480 --> 22:38.160
Together we could've been
the British Ferdinand
and Imelda Marcos.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.320
Don't worry, Camilla.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.120
Something will come along
soon to put a smile
back on that face.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.360
Yes.

22:44.680 --> 22:45.680
Yes.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.280
Like a new Magna Carta.

22:49.305 --> 22:55.309
