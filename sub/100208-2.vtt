BESS:
Oh, and steal his phone.

10:43.251 --> 10:44.469
You steal his phone,
I can break into it. NANCY: Hmm.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.210
Noted. Why can't you do it?

10:46.254 --> 10:48.430
Because I'm gonna be getting
the tool to break into the car.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.388
And you're the one
who knows where to find him.Fine.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.304

10:54.479 --> 10:57.395

10:57.439 --> 10:59.659

11:05.360 --> 11:07.710
NANCY:
My mom's car.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.234
Nick said he could get it up
and running again.

11:10.278 --> 11:11.975
But if that's all he's up to...

11:15.544 --> 11:17.198
NICK:
Whoa. Stop. [chuckles]

11:17.241 --> 11:19.069
It's not ready yet.

11:21.419 --> 11:23.900
What brings you by?
Not that I'm complaining.

11:23.944 --> 11:27.121
I need something
to break into a locked car.

11:27.164 --> 11:30.733
Because I'm trying to figure out
exactly how Tiffany died.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.430
I can help.

11:37.784 --> 11:41.048
So, uh, you feel like
telling me more?

11:41.091 --> 11:42.614
I don't want
to get you in trouble.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.665
Don't tell me you plan on doing
something dangerous again.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.840
I won't.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.887
Tell you.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.113
[birds chirping]

12:17.040 --> 12:17.737
RYAN:
George?

12:20.261 --> 12:21.436
Hey.

12:21.479 --> 12:22.437
Hey.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.700
I've been looking for you.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.269
Is this about
why you ghosted me?

12:28.312 --> 12:31.185
I need to know why you're
moving Tiffany's body.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.448
Word travels fast, huh?

12:36.277 --> 12:37.582
[sighs]

12:39.933 --> 12:42.413
Look, people like to come
after families like mine,

12:42.457 --> 12:45.155
you know, sell a story.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.288
Tiffany was...

12:47.331 --> 12:49.551
[exhales]
She was heavily medicated.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.032
I didn't need that
showing up on Page Six.

12:52.075 --> 12:53.250
So...

12:55.078 --> 12:56.732
[exhales]

12:56.776 --> 12:58.342
This way,

12:58.386 --> 13:00.344
the autopsy's done in
a bigger jurisdiction

13:00.388 --> 13:02.346
with more discretion,

13:02.390 --> 13:04.479
so my family's
privacy is protected.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.089
That's it.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.743
Really?

13:09.571 --> 13:11.834
'Cause everyone thinks
that you're hiding something.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.315
What do you mean,
everybody? You?

13:15.838 --> 13:18.014
No.George, come on.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.799
You know that I would
never do anything like that.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.496
Look,

13:21.539 --> 13:23.977
why don't we, um...

13:24.020 --> 13:25.848
why don't we reschedule
for tonight.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.547
Yeah.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.158
Hey.

13:32.463 --> 13:33.769
Dropped your phone.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.470
I got to get back to work.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.520
Hey, what else
is everybody saying about me?

13:46.782 --> 13:49.176
You really want me
to answer that?

14:03.930 --> 14:05.235
RYAN:
Hey, Carson!

14:05.279 --> 14:07.368
- Hey.
- WOMAN: Hill-topper.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.022
MAN: That's Hudson. WOMAN: Yes.

14:09.065 --> 14:11.894
I didn't know the townies
still used that term.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.157
If you came to talk to me
about your image problem,

14:14.201 --> 14:16.420
you might start by not
calling them "townies."

14:16.464 --> 14:19.641
See, that's exactly
the advice that I need.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.295
I'm sure your parents
have a publicist.

14:21.338 --> 14:23.079
Well, they do,
but I want a lawyer.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.689
I decline.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.256
You really think
that I had something to do

14:26.300 --> 14:28.084
with my wife's death?

14:29.956 --> 14:32.219
Carson, I'm innocent.

14:32.262 --> 14:33.742
Then your legal
needs are minimal.

14:33.785 --> 14:35.613
People here in this town,

14:35.657 --> 14:38.834
they... they trust you.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.097
So you can buy me a little
goodwill with the locals.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.751
Their opinions aren't for sale.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.535
But you know that.

14:44.579 --> 14:45.928
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have come to find me.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.364
Well, now, give yourself
a little bit more credit

14:47.408 --> 14:48.931
than that.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.585
'Cause I know that my parents
had you on retainer

14:50.628 --> 14:51.629
back in the day.

14:51.673 --> 14:55.111
Here's my pro bono advice:

14:55.155 --> 14:57.113
Stop acting like
you have no connection

14:57.157 --> 14:59.115
to the town you summer in.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.508
If you ever did stand trial
for you wife's death,

15:00.551 --> 15:04.251
these people are your
jurors, and to them,

15:04.294 --> 15:06.079
you're still just a rich
teen cruising Main Street

15:06.122 --> 15:07.732
in your Porsche,
making fun of them.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.865
[chuckles] Well, come on,
I was just a stupid kid.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.822
I remember.

15:14.174 --> 15:15.697
So what do I got to do
to change your mind?

15:15.740 --> 15:17.351
Nothing.

15:19.005 --> 15:22.138
Promised my wife I'd never work
for another Hudson.

15:23.313 --> 15:24.749
[engine starting]

15:27.665 --> 15:30.103
[bell jingles]No dice.

15:30.146 --> 15:32.496
He took his phone jogging.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.977
I saw you take it out of his car
and then hand it back to him.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.154
You were spying on me?

15:38.198 --> 15:39.373
You were helping him.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.289
Best case scenario,

15:42.332 --> 15:44.769
you were covering for a killer;

15:44.813 --> 15:46.771
worst case scenario,
you arethe killer.

15:46.815 --> 15:47.772
Whoa, what?

15:47.816 --> 15:49.296
Why would I kill Tiffany?

15:49.339 --> 15:50.340
You handled her food that night.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.602
So did you.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.736
But... I'm not sleeping
with her husband.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.216
[scoffs]

15:56.259 --> 15:58.522
Come on, George.

15:58.566 --> 16:01.699
It's obvious. He asked you
to "reschedule" for tonight.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.440
So now you have super hearing?

16:03.484 --> 16:06.008
I can read lips...
I learned how to online.

16:06.052 --> 16:08.010
Yeah, and everyone thought
I was the weirdo in high school.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.838
Nothing's changed.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.274
You're still judging me
and jumping to conclusions.

16:11.318 --> 16:12.972
I'm not jumping...
that is real evidence...

16:13.015 --> 16:14.060
You know what's real?

16:14.103 --> 16:15.626
Being called a slut
by your friends.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.280
When I sat down
at a lunch table,

16:17.324 --> 16:18.934
your friends
would wipe the seat off.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.023
My friends were idiots. Yeah, but they were
your friends.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.372
Were they not?

16:22.416 --> 16:25.027
Although where are they now?

16:25.071 --> 16:27.247
From what I remember,
they lost interest in you

16:27.290 --> 16:29.292
the second you became
the girl with the dying mom.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.556
[door opens]

16:34.297 --> 16:36.430
All that's left is for you
to tell my secret

16:36.473 --> 16:37.997
and laugh at me.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.261
Just like old times,
right, Drew?

16:41.304 --> 16:43.263
Get out of my way.

16:43.306 --> 16:45.700
Why are you guys so mad?

16:47.702 --> 16:50.879
The plan's off. ACE: What happened
to Ryan's cell phone?

16:50.922 --> 16:53.838
NANCY:
He took it with him.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.102
The medical examiner's van is
on its way here as we speak.

Coroner's meeting up
with it at 8:00, right?

16:57.668 --> 16:59.714
What if we found a way
to delay the van?

16:59.757 --> 17:01.672
Enough to get what we need
from the morgue?

17:01.716 --> 17:03.500
NANCY:
Yeah, there's only that one road
that leads into the morgue.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.328
Right? You have
a working car?

17:05.372 --> 17:07.417
On it. Take Bess.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.158
On it. NANCY: I'll get
the key card.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.377
We'll be done by 8:30,

and you'll be
home by 9:00.

17:12.422 --> 17:13.771
Cool.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.643
Bye.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.079
NANCY:
