00:30.730 --> 00:33.098
Hey!

00:33.100 --> 00:36.134
You piece of shit. We were having
some fun for just one moment,

00:36.136 --> 00:37.869
and then you had to go
and fuck it up.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.871
- I'm done listening to you.
- Well, I'll tell you something,

00:39.873 --> 00:41.206
- you're nothin' without me.
- For the love of god,

00:41.208 --> 00:42.908
- go away, stop!
- I've tried.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.776
I have tried and I am out
of Patience with you.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.945
I'm sick and tired
of being the one inside

00:46.947 --> 00:49.548
trying to get out all the time.

00:52.518 --> 00:54.052
Hey, I got tired
of waiting for you and...

00:54.054 --> 00:55.520
- Ashley.
- Nick.

00:55.522 --> 00:57.189
What are you doing here?

00:57.191 --> 00:59.458
I thought you were
going to school today.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.626
What's going on here?

01:01.628 --> 01:03.028
What's he doing in your room?!

01:03.030 --> 01:04.763
Hey man, I'm Elliot.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.631
Actually Nick,
that's "fuckjerry,"

01:06.633 --> 01:08.800
- he's just being modest.
- Okay, but what's "fuckjerry"

01:08.802 --> 01:10.802
- doing in your bed?
- Are you calling me a slut?

01:10.804 --> 01:12.971
- What're you doing?
- What is this?

01:12.973 --> 01:15.073
- Your face is priceless.
- Did you take a picture of me?

01:15.075 --> 01:16.842
- Delete it. -Elliot, could
you just give us a minute?

01:16.844 --> 01:18.510
Yeah Elliot, can you give
us a moment, please?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.545
That'd be great, thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.214
Why do you always do this

01:22.216 --> 01:23.982
whenever I hang out
with a guy friend?

01:23.984 --> 01:26.251
- You are ruining us.
- Hey, she's obviously

01:26.253 --> 01:28.520
she's fucking this dude, okay?

01:28.522 --> 01:30.489
She fucked Jerry
because she needs validation.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.158
Lot of girls with low self-esteem
and daddy issues do that.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.659
Hello?
Here's the deal.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.528
We're done.
I'm out of your league.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.497
And you're sad and pathetic
and I need someone

01:38.499 --> 01:40.532
- who's better than you.
- Let me just hold you.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.033
- Maybe if we held each other,
- okay, ew, ew, gross.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.869
We would understand,
we would remember how it feels

01:43.871 --> 01:46.204
- to be in each other's arms.
- Don't touch me.

01:46.206 --> 01:48.006
Please, please, don't go, Ashley...
Fuck, man.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.844
- Oh, come on.
- Sorry bro.

01:58.251 --> 02:02.053
Hey ginger, sweet tits,

02:02.055 --> 02:04.556
can you bring me
another beer please?

02:04.558 --> 02:06.958
- Ginger...
- Love you.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.660
It's me.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.995
- Hey.
- Here you go.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.831
Well, hello there,
Nicholas, thank you.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.166
What's wrong?

02:15.168 --> 02:17.669
Why... why so down?

02:17.671 --> 02:20.605
Ashley and I kinda had
a fight today.

02:20.607 --> 02:21.773
So what?
Big deal.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.708
Done.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.043
Look, here's the thing.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.578
You're going to college, right?

02:26.580 --> 02:28.613
Tomorrow you're gonna join
a fraternity,

02:28.615 --> 02:29.981
you're gonna be like
your old man.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.850
You're gonna meet
some other women there,

02:31.852 --> 02:33.318
some other hot asses.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.020
You are gonna have
truffle butter

02:35.022 --> 02:37.556
out the wazoo, my friend.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.190
That and PJ cocktails.

02:39.192 --> 02:41.626
Every hour is gonna be
PJ cocktail hour.

02:41.628 --> 02:42.861
- I don't know.
- Anything you want,

02:42.863 --> 02:44.262
you're going to live
like a king.

02:44.264 --> 02:45.964
- That's not me.
- I don't want to hear that.

02:45.966 --> 02:49.134
You are a frat man

02:49.136 --> 02:50.769
just like me.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.203
- Trust me on this.
- Okay.

02:52.205 --> 02:54.773
As long as you don't say
"PJ cocktail" ever again.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.007
Oh, my god.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.809
I could go for
one of those right now.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.244
- Stop it.
- Oh, come on,

02:59.246 --> 03:01.012
- I'm just joshin' with ya.
- It's weird, though.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.682
- No, you're not.
- Ohh!

03:14.760 --> 03:18.730
Oh! Look at this room.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.066
Oh my gosh, are you Nick?

03:21.068 --> 03:22.968
- No, I'm Nick's dad.
- Okay.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.669
- My name's Eugene.
- Eugene.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.338
You may have
heard of me on campus,

03:26.340 --> 03:29.608
- they knew me as Euey.
- Euey! Yes, man!

03:29.610 --> 03:30.842
- Billy Hawkins.
- Billy. Hi, how are you?

03:30.844 --> 03:32.110
Nice to meet you.
I'm great.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.012
Firm handshake
you got there, Billy.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.348
Let me, uh, introduce
you to the, uh,

03:36.350 --> 03:38.683
the real roommate, if I may.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.685
- Nick.
- Hey.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.754
Nick.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.923
Handshake.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.858
Hmm, look at you.

03:49.228 --> 03:52.931
Don't need those.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.934
Ah, look at that.
That's bonding Nick.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.003
That's bonding, Nick.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.738
Welcome to the first day
of the rest of your life.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.906
Just what
we've been telling him.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.042
That is what we have been
telling him the whole drive up.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.377
- Wow.
- How are you?

04:05.379 --> 04:07.078
- Oh, gosh.
- Hi.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.215
I'm sorry, that's ginger.
She's my lovely wife.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.750
- Billy Hawkins.
- What a pleasure.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.318
- An honor.
- What a pleasure.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.320
Kisses on both sides,
very European.

04:15.322 --> 04:16.855
You know what I'm talking about.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.923
- Oh, sure.
- Mr. Nick.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.058
- Yes, sir.
- I gotta ask you.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.093
- Go.
- Are you a Whitehallian?

04:22.095 --> 04:25.096
- Uh, delta kappa '89.
- God, I knew it.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.965
- Oh, no. Stop. No.
- I knew it, dude.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.967
- Oh, come on.
- I saw it in your bones,

04:28.969 --> 04:30.969
- you were radiating it.
- Oh, stop it.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.303
- Come on.
- That's not true.

04:32.305 --> 04:34.072
You were the class
that did the thing

04:34.074 --> 04:35.407
with the pigs
and the lead paint.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.408
That's the pig pit.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.942
- You...
- With the...

04:37.944 --> 04:39.878
Whoop, bom-bing.
- And then the...

04:39.880 --> 04:41.246
- Bop... okay...
- And then we go...

04:41.248 --> 04:42.781
- We go that and then we...
- And then you...

04:42.783 --> 04:44.282
- Oh!
- Oh!

04:44.284 --> 04:46.818
- And then it goes on the...
- Boh! Boh!

04:46.820 --> 04:47.986
- And then it's...
- Ooo-ooo-ah.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.355
- God! Oh!

04:50.357 --> 04:51.856
- Man! You gotta stay.
- Here?

04:51.858 --> 04:53.191
We're having orientation

04:53.193 --> 04:55.060
and then Phidelt
is throwing this party

04:55.062 --> 04:56.294
and it's gonna be insane.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.096
- Wait, today?
- Yeah, 5:30.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.798
- No, no, no. -Well, I
can do that, it's 5:30,

04:59.800 --> 05:02.000
that's not a big deal,
I can stay for 5:30.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.002
Please, Mrs. Nick!

05:04.004 --> 05:05.870
It's at 5:30, I can stay...

05:05.872 --> 05:07.038
- And just...
- Dad, dad.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.373
What, dad, what?
It would be fun,

05:08.375 --> 05:10.375
- it would...
- It's his day, honey.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.911
- Please?
- All right, she's spoken.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.245
The law!

05:14.247 --> 05:16.247
The great and powerful ginger.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.883
- Ah.
- So, uh, next time then.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.351
- One month.
- Get another bed in here.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.020
Next time I'll spend the night.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.155
- Work on him for me, will ya?
- Gotcha.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.857
- Okay.
- We're going to shape him.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.192
Okay, just bring him
out of his shell.

05:27.194 --> 05:28.793
- He's getting out!
- All right.

05:28.795 --> 05:31.096
- Thank you, Billy.
- God bless you, Mr. Nick.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.931
God loves you.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.365
All right, thank you.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.901
Aw. Mwah.

05:36.903 --> 05:39.237
Listen, I got you
a little something.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.239
Uh, you know this is college,

05:41.241 --> 05:43.742
and so I figured you need these.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.744
Uh, you wanna wear 'em
all the time.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.245
No, I don't want to
wear them all the time.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.780
No, you do. I'm wearing
one right now.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.281
- What?
No, you're not.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.983
Well, you never know.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.151
Don't tell me that,
that's disgusting, dad.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.486
It's a joke.
Take 'em.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.355
Take 'em from me, with my love.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.057
All right, look, seriously,

05:59.059 --> 06:01.326
you're gonna be okay here,
all right?

06:01.328 --> 06:03.328
Just follow Billy's lead.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.130
He'll show you the ropes, okay?

06:05.132 --> 06:06.865
All right, dad.
Thanks.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.032
You're welcome.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.034
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.836
See you, dad.

06:17.343 --> 06:19.511
- Welcome back, Roomie.
- Hey.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.212
You say goodbye
to mommy and daddy?

06:21.214 --> 06:23.281
- Yeah, they're gone.
- Good.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.784
Okay, what's your
pregame preference?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.285
Uh, I was gonna
go to orientation.

06:27.287 --> 06:29.788
Orientation, my friend,
we know our gender, all right?

06:29.790 --> 06:32.791
Not needed. What're you
already working on?

06:32.793 --> 06:35.460
Um, it's just
the financial aid form.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.162
There's a meeting
this afternoon.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.863
There's nothing on it right now.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.532
It's, uh, it's blank.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.201
There's nothing on it right now.

06:52.845 --> 06:55.013
Okay, Nick, um,

06:55.015 --> 06:56.514
this is gonna sound crazy.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.049
You're not gonna
understand this,

06:58.051 --> 07:00.151
but, uh, no one can
know about this.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.519
Why?

07:01.521 --> 07:03.822
The people in this world,
they're insane.

07:03.824 --> 07:07.292
And if they find out
that you are on financial aid,

07:07.294 --> 07:09.160
they're gonna rip
your fucking face off.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.495
Uh, that doesn't make any sense.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.030
And I know,
I know it's crazy, dude.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.965
My dad doesn't make
any money, either, okay?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.301
He's on some fucking boat
in the middle of nowhere

07:16.303 --> 07:18.970
with his next ex-wife,
but nobody knows about that,

07:18.972 --> 07:20.872
and nobody
can know about this either,

07:20.874 --> 07:22.507
because if they do,
there's no hope for you.

07:22.509 --> 07:25.076
You understand?

07:25.078 --> 07:28.613
Uh, not really,
but, uh, okay, um,

07:28.615 --> 07:32.283
yeah, I'll keep between us,
not tell anybody..

07:32.285 --> 07:34.118
- Okay, okay.
- Okay?

07:34.120 --> 07:35.386
Okay. Okay.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.188
Wow, that was intense.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.190
- Oh, man.
- Okay.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.626
Oh, my god.
Hi, ladies.

07:41.628 --> 07:45.063
- Do you like fireball?
- -Yeah.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.931
- Wow, I'm Billy.
- Olivia.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.466
I like that name.
Do you know my friend Nick?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.869
- No. Hello.
- Hi.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.403
- Nicholas Cooper.
- Hey.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.539
- Hi. I like your glasses.
- What's your guys' major?

07:54.541 --> 07:56.574
- Art.
- Me, too.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.276
- His is, too!
- Aw!

07:58.278 --> 07:59.978
We'll probably have
a class together maybe.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.412
- No, we're just visiting.
- What is this?

08:01.414 --> 08:03.181
You drink that up, man.
It's America in a bottle.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.916
- You never had fireball before?
- Smells like cinnamon gum.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.351
- Oh, this is so cute
- oh, that's so cute.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.953
- Ah! What is wrong with you?!
- Are you kidding me?!

08:08.955 --> 08:08.953
I'm sorry.

08:08.955 --> 08:12.323
- Jesus Christ, get out! -You know
what, ladies, thank you for coming.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.158
We're gonna clean this up,
and we're gonna be with you

08:14.160 --> 08:15.960
- outside in just one minute. -Good
luck getting into any house,

08:15.962 --> 08:17.295
- you fucking pussies.
- Such losers!

08:17.297 --> 08:20.164
All right, bye-bye.
Wow. That went well.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.532
I want you to practice
sipping that,

08:21.534 --> 08:23.234
and, uh, you're gonna...
No, it's gonna be fine.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.069
No, that's... that's...
It's... it's not me, okay.

08:25.071 --> 08:27.105
That's, that's obviously
not my thing.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.240
Nick, come on, man, you had one
little bump, we're gonna rebound.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.541
We're gonna go to this party
and everything's

08:30.543 --> 08:32.076
gonna be awesome, okay?

08:32.078 --> 08:34.078
I don't wanna go to a party.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.413
You go.
Have fun.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.347
I'm gonna get some work done.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.119
All right, bro.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.188
But I tried, and I'll be
there if you need me.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.926
And I'm...
I'm gonna miss you.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.594
I'm gonna be okay,
but I'm gonna miss you.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.129
And if you need me,

08:51.131 --> 08:52.397
I'll be at that party.

08:54.099 --> 08:55.400
Here we go!

09:00.339 --> 09:02.307
He's texting me again.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.108
- Let me see.
- Look.

09:05.577 --> 09:08.279
Oh, my god, this kid is so sad.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.214
Ugh, he needs help.

09:11.583 --> 09:13.418
I have an idea.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.286
Wanna help fix this kid?

09:15.288 --> 09:16.521
How?

09:20.592 --> 09:22.126
What're you doing?

09:22.128 --> 09:25.063
Gotta break him down
to build him up.

09:27.366 --> 09:28.700
Let me see.

09:30.235 --> 09:33.104
"Hashtag Nick Cooper is sad."

09:33.106 --> 09:34.539
Ouch.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.174
Do it!

09:57.229 --> 09:59.664
Hi. I applaud
your work ethic,

09:59.666 --> 10:02.200
considering school
hasn't even started yet,

10:02.202 --> 10:04.435
but you're coming
to this Rager, okay?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.604
I was there, and I was trying
to have a really good time,

10:06.606 --> 10:08.139
but all I could think of was you

10:08.141 --> 10:09.507
and it was really fucking gay,

10:09.509 --> 10:12.310
so let's fucking go.
Let's fucking go!

10:30.396 --> 10:32.730
How's it going, guys?

10:32.732 --> 10:34.265
Can I borrow these for a minute?

10:34.267 --> 10:35.566
Thank you.
Hold this.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.635
Whoa!
Man, what's going on?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.637
- What the fuck is that?
- What?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.040
- It's a cup.
- A blue cup.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.541
How dare you bring these
blue liberal bullshit colors

10:43.543 --> 10:45.043
- into this house.
- I'm not a liberal.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.744
I mean, you're
wearing blue, man.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.780
Trump!

10:48.782 --> 10:50.648
Wow, don't worry, man.
It's cool.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.417
Hey guys, I see you
guys, uh, met Benjamin.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.751
Hi, I'm Billy.

10:53.753 --> 10:55.286
Hi, how are you?
I'm Joshua.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.687
- My friend Nick.
- I'm Adam.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.556
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad you guys stopped by.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.091
You have a good time, all right?

11:00.093 --> 11:01.559
All right.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.261
What the hell
was that all about?

11:03.263 --> 11:05.663
That my friend,

11:05.665 --> 11:07.198
that's our future.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.067
That's our future?
Those guys?

11:09.069 --> 11:11.069
- Which girl you want?
- Uh, none.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.570
- That one.
- No.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.272
She's an antelope, you're a lion

11:14.274 --> 11:16.240
- on the planes of Africa.
- Like an anteater, more

11:16.242 --> 11:18.709
- and she... she's...
- Shh shh shh shh... go.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.711
I'll be here.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.480
- You can do it, Nick.
- Okay.

11:25.317 --> 11:27.285
Um, hi.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.719
What's your name?

11:28.721 --> 11:31.322
Hey. The ultimate
Frisbee competition

11:31.324 --> 11:33.157
isn't till tomorrow, faggot.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.493
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.662
What the fuck was that?

11:37.664 --> 11:39.530
Ah, hey, hey.
No, it's cool, it's cool.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.532
That was a lay up man,
you gotta dunk that shit.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.234
That went about as well
as a Shaq free throw.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.735
Yeah, tell her that.

11:44.737 --> 11:47.438
No. You do it.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.474
- You want me to do it?
- Sure.

11:50.509 --> 11:51.843
Hi, there.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.545
- How's it going?
- Hi.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.215
That went about as well
as a Shaq free throw.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.483
That was a good one.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.817
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.385
Segregation kinda made
some sense.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.887
Oil-water situation.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.890
I just think we really need
to focus on, you know,

12:05.892 --> 12:07.758
the reasons why we haven't had

12:07.760 --> 12:09.293
African-Americans here.

12:09.295 --> 12:10.461
Black, you can say black,
they're not here.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.263
All right, Mr. PC.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.532
I'm gonna put this in terms
so that you can understand.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.400
Go to any high school
in this country

12:16.402 --> 12:18.903
and look at how kids choose
to sit at the lunch tables.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.738
People like their own kind.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.440
All right, we're not forcing
anybody into a situation

12:22.442 --> 12:25.309
that they don't already
choose for themselves.

12:25.311 --> 12:26.911
Natural selection.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.779
- In scientific terms.
- But let's not, like,

12:28.781 --> 12:32.183
shove it in someone's face
that we all own s-classes.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.685
I would never,
'cause I drive a g-wagon.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.521
Listen, I don't wear the same
pair of underwear every day,

12:36.523 --> 12:37.922
why am I gonna drive
the same color range rover

12:37.924 --> 12:39.690
- every month?
- That's true.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.526
I just think that we need
to have like, you know,

12:41.528 --> 12:43.828
not like black
celebrity kids but like,

12:43.830 --> 12:45.429
like real black people, ya know?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.798
What do you mean black,
'real black people'?

12:47.800 --> 12:50.835
You know, like... like,
like real, like... like...

12:50.837 --> 12:53.304
Hey Amanda, is your
sorority diverse?

12:53.306 --> 12:56.174
Yeah, I mean we have a lot
of different colored uggs.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.575
- See.
- Just some color,

12:57.577 --> 12:59.177
I just want some color, man,
color scheme,

12:59.179 --> 13:00.578
change it up a little
bit, you know?

13:00.580 --> 13:02.680
- So get in the sun.
- How about a mulatto?

13:02.682 --> 13:04.482
- You wanna go sit down?
- Yeah.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.185
- You happy now?
- Yeah, guess so.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.353
Tell him, not to do
this ever again.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.688
Come on dude,
you know like, like, uh...

13:10.690 --> 13:11.856
Dah, dah, dah!

13:14.627 --> 13:15.860
Hey.

13:17.629 --> 13:20.198
You look like
you're having a blast.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.366
Yeah? Well, what gave that away?

13:22.368 --> 13:25.236
Don't worry, this is not
really for me, either.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.470
I'm... I'm Nick.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.805
I'm Rosanna.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.507
Nice to meet you, Rosanna.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.809
I really like your outfit.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.511
Thanks, we all had to wear them.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.646
I think you wore yours best.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.815
You're sweet.

13:37.817 --> 13:41.819
So, uh, what do you
want to major in?

13:41.821 --> 13:44.222
- Probably music.
- Yeah?

13:44.224 --> 13:46.290
I like art history.

13:46.292 --> 13:49.260
Actually here on
a scholarship for it.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.395
Is it the Watson
fellowship program?

13:51.397 --> 13:52.730
Yeah.
How'd you know that?

13:52.732 --> 13:55.733
My dad is actually
a professor here

13:55.735 --> 13:57.602
in the art history department.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.004
Yeah, I'd love
to meet him sometime.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.472
Rosanna?
Thank god.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.774
The ZB babes
are looking for you.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.309
The real party
is going on inside.

14:05.311 --> 14:06.544
I gotta take you with me.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.712
Hey, Adam.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.247
- Yeah, for sure.
- Right this way.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.514
- I'll see you around.
- Um...

14:10.516 --> 14:12.683
You having a good time,
little buddy?

14:48.553 --> 14:50.054
Welcome to my humble abode.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.323
Is your roommate here?

14:52.325 --> 14:55.960
I don't want your name
to be Melissa tonight.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.495
I want it to be fucking Megan.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.562
- Megan?
- Yeah.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.731
Get on there.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.800
Okay, Megan, come here.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.502
- Motherfuck...
- Melissa.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.671
- Here I come. Ugh!
- Oh, god, oh!

15:06.673 --> 15:08.005
Holy fuck, Megan.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.507
Okay, I got a plan.
I got a plan.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.908
Let me get up here,
let me get up here,

15:10.910 --> 15:12.443
let me get up here.
Let me get up...

15:12.445 --> 15:14.645
Put your finger... put your
finger in my asshole.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.981
Put your finger in my ass.
Put it in.

15:16.983 --> 15:18.316
Go.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.321
Ah!
Oh, my god!

15:23.323 --> 15:25.990
Oh, my god!
Yeah...

15:25.992 --> 15:27.491
It's Melissa.

15:27.493 --> 15:28.826
Just get the hell out
of here, okay?

15:28.828 --> 15:31.028
But you're welcome back
any time!

15:31.030 --> 15:33.631
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

15:34.766 --> 15:36.767
Morning, bro.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.469
That was horrifying, Billy.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.706
That was incredible.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.040
What'd you think of her?

15:43.042 --> 15:44.742
Well, got nothing on
my girlfriend.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.744
Oh, yeah?

15:46.746 --> 15:48.079
Does your girlfriend
have beautiful breasts

15:48.081 --> 15:49.780
- like that?
- I tried not to look,

15:49.782 --> 15:51.782
but my girlfriend
has a beautiful body, yes.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.951
Well, if she's got
a body like that,

15:53.953 --> 15:57.121
then you can get with any
body in this campus.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.656
No comment.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.658
Too bad I still love
my girlfriend. Okay?

16:00.660 --> 16:03.060
What is this girlfriend
you're talking about?

16:03.062 --> 16:05.129
Let's see.
Is this her?

16:05.131 --> 16:06.664
Yeah.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.833
Who's "fuckjerry"?

16:08.835 --> 16:10.034
He's a friend.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.635
Doesn't really look like
her friend.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.671
- What the hell...
- Just... just listen, man.

16:13.673 --> 16:17.074
"When the bf is like
'we need to talk, '

16:17.076 --> 16:20.778
and the GF says
'who are you again?'"

16:20.780 --> 16:23.647
"hashtag Nick Cooper is sad."

16:23.649 --> 16:26.650
- We are not broken up.
- I think you are, man.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.619
But you know what?
It's okay.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.020
Because you are here
for a reason.

16:30.022 --> 16:31.122
The parties, the women,

16:31.124 --> 16:33.457
- everything.
- See, see,

16:33.459 --> 16:36.060
you talk about women. I don't want
to get with random college girls.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.595
- No. No.
- That's not for me, okay?

16:37.597 --> 16:39.930
No, no, Nick.
Not random, my friend. No.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.932
Carefully sought out,

16:41.934 --> 16:44.702
vetted, and FDA approved.

16:44.704 --> 16:48.072
I love Ashley,
and Ashley loves me.

16:49.474 --> 16:51.409
Okay?

16:52.711 --> 16:54.745
So, think about it.

16:58.884 --> 17:00.584
Think about it.

17:00.586 --> 17:03.754
I'll be in my dressing room.

17:21.506 --> 17:23.174
You did not tell him
that I'm coming to campus.

17:23.175 --> 17:26.176
- Why?
- I was bored.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.045
I also asked him
to give you money.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.581
Ooh. That's good.
How much?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.516
- 300.
- Hmm.

17:36.621 --> 17:38.889
So does this mean that
we're going to campus?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.224
I guess.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.827
Ha, he's gonna lose his shit.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.169
Hey, guys.

17:52.171 --> 17:53.704
- Hey, bud.
- How's it going?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.005
- Good.
- Good.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.540
Hey, what's that kid's deal?

17:56.542 --> 17:57.908
- Oh, Nick?
- Yeah.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.910
That's my roommate.
He's the coolest guy.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.712
Coolest guy ever.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.214
Why's he sitting alone?

18:03.216 --> 18:05.082
Ah, he's hard to get to know.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.786
He, he comes from
this really old money in Ohio.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.120
- Cooper tire.
- Nice.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.489
Yeah.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.890
He could use our company.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.593
Yeah? Yeah, for sure. Uh, Nick!

18:15.595 --> 18:17.528
Come here.

18:20.198 --> 18:23.200
He's shy, you know,
but couple of shots in him,

18:23.202 --> 18:24.835
he's great.

18:24.837 --> 18:27.171
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, boys.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.706
Haven't seen you around
in a while.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.875
Just lots of work, you know?

18:30.877 --> 18:32.510
Let me give you
some unsolicited advice.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.111
You don't actually
have to do work.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.514
- What does that mean?
- If you know the right people,

18:36.516 --> 18:37.848
things are made easier.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.850
And a hell of a lot more fun.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.719
- Do you do work?
- No.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.522
- See.
- See what?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.223
- Benjamin's always right.
- That's retarded.

18:46.225 --> 18:48.292
Benjamin's definitely
always right.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.528
Correct. We're having
another party this weekend.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.130
Boys would love
to see you there.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.201
See you, guys.

18:57.203 --> 18:58.869
The "boys would love
to see you there."

18:58.871 --> 19:00.604
I don't know, man.

19:00.606 --> 19:03.040
I was gonna reread the "series
of unfortunate events."

19:03.042 --> 19:04.575
No, listen to me.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.577
There is a hot young
lit major out there

19:06.579 --> 19:08.546
who's dying
to nibble on your balls

19:08.548 --> 19:09.880
and tell you everything
you need to know

19:09.882 --> 19:11.181
about that book, okay?

19:11.183 --> 19:13.884
- Books. It's a series...
- Never heard of it.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.719
Of unfortunate...
Okay.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.766
Ay, Yi, Yi,
I guess this is the place.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.334
Okay, let's do it.

19:30.336 --> 19:32.870
I made them think that thetas
were asking for you.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.205
I'm a genius.

19:35.207 --> 19:36.574
You good?

19:36.576 --> 19:37.975
All right.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.310
Let's get back in there.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.178
- Boot and rally.
- Boot and rally

19:44.215 --> 19:47.284
Ashley. Oh, my god,
it's great to see you.

19:47.286 --> 19:49.286
- You look amazing.
- Okay, yes, I'm here.

19:49.288 --> 19:50.788
Do you have my money?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.022
Hey Ashley,
not... not like this.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.591
I... I thought,
I thought we...

19:53.593 --> 19:54.825
Then, like, what, Nick?
You thought what?

19:54.827 --> 19:56.060
This is your
ex-girlfriend Ashley?

19:56.062 --> 19:58.362
- Yes.
- How are you here?

19:58.364 --> 20:00.731
How am I here?
He texts me, everywhere.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.734
- Don't text her, Nick.
- Nick, we're over.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.302
Okay, we just wanted
to tell you together

20:05.304 --> 20:06.737
since his posts weren't enough.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.138
Yeah, sorry buddy,
things happen.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.774
Things happen?
Like you steal my girlfriend!

20:10.776 --> 20:12.242
If you would
just explain to me why,

20:12.244 --> 20:13.777
- them maybe I'd understand.
- You know why, Nick.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.279
Everyone knows why.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.981
Listen, I'll retire
the "Nick Cooper is sad" tag,

20:16.983 --> 20:18.682
although everyone loves it.

20:18.684 --> 20:21.185
Wait, are you the Nick Cooper of

20:21.187 --> 20:23.887
"hashtag Nick Cooper is sad"?

20:23.889 --> 20:25.990
Holy shit!

20:25.992 --> 20:28.258
Yeah, he's my ex,
but, um, now I'm with Elliot.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.327
He's fuckjerry.

20:30.329 --> 20:31.862
Really?

20:31.864 --> 20:33.364
Will you do a shot off my tits?

20:33.366 --> 20:35.966
Sure.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.135
- I mean, it's all I'm asking.
- Just don't cry again, please.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.670
I'm so glad
I'm breaking up with you.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.372
- We don't have to.
- Bye.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.040
- Thank you, Ashley.
- Doesn't have to be this way.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.408
- Please, Ashley!
- Nick,

20:44.410 --> 20:46.043
- you're stronger than this.
- I love you...

20:46.045 --> 20:47.745
You don't love her,
you're an asshole.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.179
- Stow and go.
- That's not me.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.881
- Say it to me, stow and go.
- That's not me.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.383
- Stow and go.
- Boot and rally.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.917
- Boot and rally.
- Let's do this shit.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.352
Boot and rally.

20:57.122 --> 21:00.157
The "fuckjerry" nonsense
ends right now.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.359
Remember that this is a sport

21:02.361 --> 21:04.662
and confidence is everything.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.331
- You do soulcycle?
- Yeah, why?

21:07.333 --> 21:09.333
I, uh, thought I recognized
you from somewhere.

21:09.335 --> 21:10.868
See, man.
That's how you do it.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.937
You spit some game
and you give her some e.

21:15.874 --> 21:17.408
Okay, dude,

21:17.410 --> 21:20.044
this is the only way
to get back at your ex, okay?

21:20.046 --> 21:21.779
And because I'm the man,
we're gonna get you

21:21.781 --> 21:23.247
some sweet, sweet redemption.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.282
- So you hold these.
- Please don't give her both.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.984
And you remember
what I told you.

21:26.986 --> 21:29.153
You act like you know
she wants to fuck you,

21:29.155 --> 21:30.387
because she does.

21:30.389 --> 21:33.157
And you watch Ashley
lose her mind.

21:34.893 --> 21:37.895
Balls, it's gonna
take some balls.

21:39.064 --> 21:40.364
Make us proud.

21:40.366 --> 21:43.133
So, uh, decided to drop
ultimate Frisbee.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.269
- Just wasn't for me.
- Oh, really?

21:45.271 --> 21:48.005
- You look like you need this.
- Nick, right?

21:48.007 --> 21:50.441
- Very good.
- Well, I'm very good.

21:52.377 --> 21:55.379
What does he hold your hand
when you pee, too?

21:55.381 --> 21:57.081
That means she likes
golden showers.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.750
- Oh my god, shut up.
- Oh, yeah?

22:18.137 --> 22:19.937
No tootsie pop, no lap dog.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.939
You have 20 seconds
to prove your worth.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.273
I had a girlfriend
for three years.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.875
That don't mean shit, freshman.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.878
Ah! Okay, freshman.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.915
Shit... Oh, oh.

22:31.917 --> 22:34.885
Oh, my god.
Okay, fuck.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.921
Oh, my god.

22:47.766 --> 22:50.768
Nick.
It's me.

22:50.770 --> 22:53.103
Oh hi, good morning.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.072
Good morning.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.874
- Are you okay?
- Billy.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.009
What's going on?
Are you pregnant?

22:59.011 --> 23:00.144
No.
I'm not pregnant.

23:00.146 --> 23:01.378
- What happened?
- I hooked up.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.447
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

23:03.449 --> 23:05.783
- Yeah.
- Oh. Good morning!

23:05.785 --> 23:08.085
Wow!
With Nicolette?

23:08.087 --> 23:10.988
Yes. So um,
she gave me a hand job,

23:10.990 --> 23:13.991
and then I went down on her.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.827
No, what? No.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.328
Your dick's out
and she's not sucking it, why?

23:18.330 --> 23:20.964
My dick wasn't out
actually. Um...

23:20.966 --> 23:25.102
No! She gave you a OTPHJ,
that's so embarrassing.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.104
- She cried.
- What? You hit her?

23:27.106 --> 23:29.106
No, no, I didn't hit her.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.440
No, I can do this thing
with my tongue.

23:30.442 --> 23:32.442
I learned it with my ex, Ashley.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.144
Made Nicolette cry.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.814
But there was no
connection, and that's...

23:36.816 --> 23:40.150
Connection?! You made a ZB cry,
you mean, like... like tears?

23:40.152 --> 23:42.486
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, Nick!

23:42.488 --> 23:46.023
The next four years are looking
very up right now, my friend.

23:46.025 --> 23:49.593
You're gonna be the man
all over frat row, dude.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.595
That girl is telling
all the other girls

23:51.597 --> 23:53.297
about what you did.

23:53.299 --> 23:56.300
We're gonna sell posters
of your fucking face.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.335
Girls all over town and beyond
are gonna fucking...

23:58.337 --> 24:01.405
- "Ah!" They're gonna "ah..."
- Stop it.

24:01.407 --> 24:04.942
To your fucking face bro, yes!

24:04.944 --> 24:07.411
- I guess.
- No, you know, man.

24:07.413 --> 24:10.013
Is it romantic?
Doesn't sound very romantic.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.883
Romantic! This is not a
"pride and prejudice" novel,

24:12.885 --> 24:15.352
not that I read it,
I just know the plot,

24:15.354 --> 24:16.887
- this is college.
- Right.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.423
College!
Yes, Mr. Cooper.

24:19.425 --> 24:20.958
Yes!

24:20.960 --> 24:23.460
Oh, Mr. Cooper.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.329
Mr., Mr. Cooper.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.327
Do you need something, Billy?

24:57.329 --> 25:00.030
- Yeah, this has to stop.
- What does?

25:00.032 --> 25:01.431
This. You.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.433
Where have you been?
I miss my friend.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.535
- Billy, I've got work to do.
- No, Nick! No!

25:05.537 --> 25:07.170
You have life

25:07.172 --> 25:09.907
and you have parties
and you have girls to do.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.541
This will always be there,

25:11.543 --> 25:15.012
that, that will not.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.513
This is your moment.
What is this?

25:16.515 --> 25:18.682
Walt, who's Walt Whitman?

25:18.684 --> 25:20.183
Don't throw Whitman.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.219
It's homework, okay?

25:22.221 --> 25:24.388
Which I don't think I've ever
seen you consider doing.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.423
- Of course not. -Look,
I've gotta maintain a 3.4

25:26.425 --> 25:28.959
for my financial aid.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.461
Nick, hey, we talked about that.

25:31.463 --> 25:33.263
You do not bring that up.

25:33.265 --> 25:36.300
We have to build up
our connections.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.001
- No. No, we don't.
- You know that thing

25:38.003 --> 25:40.137
you did with Nicolette.
Good shit, right?

25:40.139 --> 25:41.638
Well, it has
a short half-life

25:41.640 --> 25:43.173
and you're letting it
fucking decay.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.342
Girls forget, and they move on.

25:45.344 --> 25:46.677
You gotta get 'em
while you're hot.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.445
Billy, I told you,
it felt hollow.

25:48.447 --> 25:49.713
- Okay?
- -Oh.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.481
It's not the time for love.

25:51.483 --> 25:53.350
The more girls that you slay,

25:53.352 --> 25:55.485
the more those bros will play.

25:55.487 --> 25:58.021
And then the more options
that we'll have.

25:58.023 --> 25:59.990
But I don't want to get
with random girls,

25:59.992 --> 26:01.525
just so I can get in
a house that I don't...

26:01.527 --> 26:03.226
Balls!

26:03.228 --> 26:04.561
You're killing me, Nick.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.263
- Stop.
- -Hey.

26:06.265 --> 26:09.266
People are trying to study.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.134
- Sorry.
- Look at them go, Nick.

26:11.136 --> 26:13.136
There they go.
Never to be seen again

26:13.138 --> 26:15.973
if you don't pick up your
motherfucking game.

26:18.276 --> 26:20.277
Billy, I've got work to do.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.312
You've got a shot at greatness

26:22.314 --> 26:24.081
and you're throwing it all away,

26:24.083 --> 26:26.249
and Mr. Nick's
gonna be fucking pissed.

26:26.251 --> 26:29.052
Just go, just... just...
Just go away, please.

26:29.054 --> 26:32.055
- Slither... slither out of here.
- I'm going.

26:32.057 --> 26:35.359
But I'm going
with hope in my heart,

26:35.361 --> 26:38.161
hope, and it's right here,

26:38.163 --> 26:40.097
that you're gonna turn around.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.198
Okay.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.001
Arrivederci!

26:47.171 --> 26:49.239
Hey buddy,
how about the next time

26:49.241 --> 26:51.375
you and, uh, your
boyfriend get in a tiff,

26:51.377 --> 26:53.543
you don't do it in a library.

26:53.545 --> 26:55.245
He's... he's not my...
My boyfriend.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.581
Hey man, no judgment here, okay?

26:57.583 --> 26:59.182
Okay.

27:00.685 --> 27:04.688
There are books on the floor.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.757
Why don't you clean up
after yourself, chief?

27:06.759 --> 27:09.192
- Yeah, sorry.
- Were you raised in a barn?

27:14.699 --> 27:16.333
Bro...

27:16.335 --> 27:19.669
Look at you whining
like a little bitch.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.204
Get out there.

27:21.206 --> 27:23.073
Come on, Billy's right, okay?

27:23.075 --> 27:24.608
These things do
have a half life,

27:24.610 --> 27:26.209
and these girls
are gonna be moving on.

27:26.211 --> 27:27.544
You gotta keep it up.

27:29.081 --> 27:32.082
By the way, uh, I gotta say,

27:32.084 --> 27:34.051
some good moves the other day.

28:05.350 --> 28:09.553
All right, huddle up, freshmen.

28:09.555 --> 28:12.355
Welcome to Phidelt, everybody.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.757
I'm Adam Welker, president.

28:13.759 --> 28:16.460
Whoo!

28:16.462 --> 28:18.361
Now many of you guys are here,

28:18.363 --> 28:20.864
because you want to join
our fraternity,

28:20.866 --> 28:23.300
and truth be told,
why wouldn't you?

28:23.302 --> 28:25.635
Whoo! Whoo!

28:25.637 --> 28:28.839
If you guys go on
with the pledging process,

28:28.841 --> 28:31.842
you're in for a very interesting
next couple of months.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.544
At the end of which,
we will choose

28:34.546 --> 28:37.848
the very best of you to join
our prestigious fraternity.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.684
Now, the pledging process
is no walk in the park,

28:40.686 --> 28:43.520
but I promise, if you succeed,

28:43.522 --> 28:45.422
Phidelt will be
the best time of your life.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.759
- To Phidelt!
- -To Phidelt!

28:52.231 --> 28:53.730
- To Phidelt!
- Drink that shit!

28:53.732 --> 28:55.465
So Nick, where else
did you apply to college?

28:55.467 --> 28:57.734
Williams was my first choice.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.470
If you'd gone to Williams, Nick,
you'd be working all day.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.239
You would have had to put
your life on hiatus.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.573
Dude, that's why
I didn't go to Williams.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.542
- Super gay.
- Yeah, fuck those schools.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.310
They're all work and no fun.

29:07.312 --> 29:08.845
But, I mean, don't you need
to work hard in college,

29:08.847 --> 29:10.480
- I mean, to get a good job?
- Oh, this guy!

29:10.482 --> 29:12.916
- Come on, man, no!
- That's what dads are for.

29:14.519 --> 29:16.686
Do not utter one more word

29:16.688 --> 29:19.756
from that goddamn
fucking nerd brain of yours.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.559
You tell them exactly what I
tell you to from here on out,

29:22.561 --> 29:25.562
because when you don't
concentrate on my voice,

29:25.564 --> 29:28.798
you say the absolute
worst fucking thing.

29:28.800 --> 29:33.270
You fucking lost Ashley, man.
Fucking gone.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.205
When you don't say
what I tell you to,

29:35.207 --> 29:39.176
they'll want nothing to do with you.
You'll see.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.178
Hey guys, then you
should've gone to brown

29:41.180 --> 29:43.513
and taken intro
to dicksucking pass/fail.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.482
All right.

29:45.484 --> 29:46.850
Actually, I prefer their
course, I think it's called

29:46.852 --> 29:49.319
tossing salad in Arabia?
Pass/fail, of course.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.321
I've also heard
that their gender crisis

29:51.323 --> 29:54.791
during the Cuban missile crisis
class is phenomenal.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.661
- He's funny.
- He's a funny man!

29:57.663 --> 29:58.962
No socialists in my house!

29:58.964 --> 30:01.464
I'm not socialist.
I'm from San Francisco.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.732
Outta the way.
Outta the way.

30:02.734 --> 30:05.302
- Outta the way.
- I'm from San Francisco.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.703
Outta the way.
Outta the way.

30:06.705 --> 30:08.638
I'm gonna get you,
San Francisco.

30:24.923 --> 30:26.957
Hey.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.259
- Hey.
- Thought you disappeared.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.261
I was just talking to Adam.

30:31.263 --> 30:33.930
Adam, right.

30:33.932 --> 30:35.232
So you guys like,

30:35.234 --> 30:36.900
you guys like know each other?

30:36.902 --> 30:38.501
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.770
I've been spending
a lot of time with the ZBS

30:40.772 --> 30:42.606
and they are very close
to Phidelts.

30:42.608 --> 30:44.674
- So...
- You know, uh,

30:44.676 --> 30:46.509
I'm actually
considering pledging.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.979
- Phidelt?
- Yeah.

30:48.981 --> 30:50.647
You're joking.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.649
They say it looks
great on a resume,

30:52.651 --> 30:55.518
so we'll see.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.254
You know, Nick,

30:57.256 --> 30:59.656
the girls
were talking about you.

30:59.658 --> 31:02.759
Uh, hey, uh,

31:02.761 --> 31:05.629
that was, uh, I'm not like that.

31:05.631 --> 31:07.864
Really? Because that's
not what I heard.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.799
No, I just got out of like,
a three-year relationship.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.836
I'm seriously not into
random hookups.

31:12.838 --> 31:15.272
I promise.

31:18.476 --> 31:20.043
Good.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.746
Chong! Chong! Chong!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

31:22.748 --> 31:24.481
Hold it, hold it.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.616
One must earn the right

31:26.618 --> 31:28.618
- to use the word "nigger."
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.520
You can't say that shit,
man, only I can say that.

31:30.522 --> 31:31.855
- All right?
- Birthright!

31:31.857 --> 31:33.356
How do you earn the
right to say it?

31:33.358 --> 31:34.758
Only when you're
our kind of brother,

31:34.760 --> 31:37.460
- will we let you know.
- That is correct.

31:37.462 --> 31:40.563
Now let's carb up,
chitlins, and Xbox.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.899
- Scooch.
- Oh Rosanna, let's go.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.769
This party's dead,
and pike's having a Rager!

31:45.771 --> 31:46.771
Uh...

31:51.676 --> 31:54.010
This is Ashley. And Ashley
goes off with fuckjerry.

31:54.012 --> 31:55.879
That... that's, that's over and
done with, we've had that happen.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.547
Then there's Rosanna,
but, but then, you know what?

31:57.549 --> 31:59.416
Maybe... may...

31:59.418 --> 32:02.585
No, stop.
Shh... please.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.087
Shut up.
Shut up.

32:04.089 --> 32:07.490
Please. Oh, no,
that is not funny.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.392
That is not...
I'm not gonna do that.

32:09.394 --> 32:10.727
Because that's not me, man.

32:10.729 --> 32:13.563
- Nick!
- Billy.

32:13.565 --> 32:14.898
Hi.

32:14.900 --> 32:16.066
Who are you talking to?

32:16.068 --> 32:17.067
Huh.

32:17.069 --> 32:19.069
Oh. Myself.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.770
Look, Billy, I need your help.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.772
- Okay, man.
- All right, okay.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.541
So Rosanna, you know the girl

32:24.543 --> 32:27.544
- I've been telling you about.
- Who?

32:27.546 --> 32:29.412
Rosanna, you know she
plays the piano and...

32:29.414 --> 32:31.414
- No.
- She plays the piano

32:31.416 --> 32:33.583
and... and she's an amazing,
beautiful girl,

32:33.585 --> 32:36.353
and we've had, we've had two
incredible conversations.

32:36.355 --> 32:37.687
Like every time I get so close,

32:37.689 --> 32:39.389
someone comes up
and interrupts it.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.124
Okay, tonight was Amanda,
and then Adam,

32:41.126 --> 32:43.793
Adam walked in the other day,
and he took her off.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.428
I just can't seem
to get a break.

32:45.430 --> 32:46.863
Well man, I told you, bro,
that's what you get

32:46.865 --> 32:48.398
when you're the head
of fucking Phidelt.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.400
- Everything.
- Apparently.

32:50.402 --> 32:53.570
Let me break this down to you, Mr.
Cooper.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.739
Your nice little girl

32:55.741 --> 32:58.441
is pledging to be a ZB.

32:58.443 --> 33:01.010
Now she cuddled up to you
and was really charming

33:01.012 --> 33:02.712
and made you feel
all warm inside.

33:02.714 --> 33:05.548
And then she moved on
to the head of Phidelt

33:05.550 --> 33:07.884
where she did
the exact same thing.

33:07.886 --> 33:10.754
Now, when you weren't looking,

33:10.756 --> 33:13.890
she turned back to see if her little
game she played on you worked.

33:13.892 --> 33:16.426
And guess what? It did.
Look at you, you're a mess.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.762
Yeah, I know I'm a mess, Billy.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.463
You don't have to tell me,
because I know it.

33:20.465 --> 33:22.632
But I just feel like,
for the first time since,

33:22.634 --> 33:25.034
like, way before I even met
Ashley, and it feels like

33:25.036 --> 33:27.070
- it could be real, you know?
- Dude! Listen to you.

33:27.072 --> 33:29.072
You're talking about
butterflies and electricity.

33:29.074 --> 33:31.174
You sound like an insane person.

33:31.176 --> 33:34.444
That woman is just like
all the others, okay?

33:34.446 --> 33:35.879
And you're gonna see.

33:35.881 --> 33:37.781
You're gonna walk into
this fucking room

33:37.783 --> 33:40.417
and she's gonna have
three fingers in my ass.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.419
And she's gonna be
sucking on Adam's dick,

33:42.421 --> 33:43.753
and Benjamin, the old guy,
is gonna be filming

33:43.755 --> 33:45.021
- the whole thing.
- She's not like that.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.556
Stop talking about her
like you think

33:46.558 --> 33:48.091
you know her, Billy!

33:48.093 --> 33:50.493
- She's not like that!
- You're living in a dreamland!

33:50.495 --> 33:53.196
But, actually,
it's not time for that.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.898
This is college, bro.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.433
And you wanna be a Phidelt,

33:56.435 --> 33:58.668
and you wanna be a BMOC.

33:58.670 --> 34:01.004
You are young,
you are in college,

34:01.006 --> 34:04.741
and you should be fucking
as many girls as possible.

34:04.743 --> 34:07.710
Oh my god, I'm upset,
Jesus Christ.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.045
All right.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.715
Okay. Okay.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.885
Will you please
just be cool and fuck girls

34:15.887 --> 34:17.219
and go to parties

34:17.222 --> 34:19.922
and rock on like you born to do?

34:19.925 --> 34:23.560
If you do that,
I will give you this drink.

34:25.663 --> 34:27.530
I'm gonna try.
I'll try to be cool.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.466
Give me more than that.

34:30.868 --> 34:32.569
- I promise.
- Ah!

34:32.571 --> 34:33.969
Take that.

34:33.972 --> 34:36.672
- Cheers.
- I promise.

34:36.675 --> 34:39.074
- To your calm body.
- Okay.

34:41.011 --> 34:42.946
- This is terrible
- sit down here.

34:42.947 --> 34:45.482
I know I'm a mess, but you don't
have to kill me for it, okay?

34:45.484 --> 34:47.150
I think you're killing me,

34:47.152 --> 34:48.851
and I gotta go to the bathroom.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.253
I'm sorry.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.255
He's crazy.

34:52.257 --> 34:55.925
Rosanna, I know you have
a crush on someone.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.894
Come on, just tell us.

34:57.896 --> 35:01.664
Okay, I think that Nick is cute,

35:01.666 --> 35:02.999
and he seems different.

35:03.001 --> 35:04.534
- So...
- He's not.

35:04.536 --> 35:06.569
That tongue is different.

35:06.571 --> 35:09.539
- Is he pledging Phidelt?
- I think he's considering it.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.975
Well, then, he's definitely not.

35:11.977 --> 35:14.077
No guys, I had a conversation
with him the other night.

35:14.079 --> 35:15.712
And he just got out of a
really long relationship,

35:15.714 --> 35:17.080
and I think that he's
having a tough time.

35:17.082 --> 35:18.948
- He's lying.
- Which is stupid,

35:18.950 --> 35:20.750
'cause it's not like
we actually give a shit.

35:20.752 --> 35:21.985
Exactly.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.086
It's about keeping your number

35:23.088 --> 35:25.655
- above his.
- My number?

35:25.657 --> 35:26.789
Power of the pussy, Rosanna.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.726
- Trust us.
- I'm sorry, what?

35:29.728 --> 35:32.061
Pregame, party, sex, soul,

35:32.063 --> 35:34.564
pregame, party, different sex,

35:34.566 --> 35:36.900
- still drunk!

35:36.902 --> 35:39.235
And once you've seen every
Phidelt, Alphadelt,

35:39.237 --> 35:41.838
and Sigep's rope face,
you own them.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.306
They think this is their sport.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.742
- Trust us.
- It's not.

35:47.745 --> 35:50.079
So, Auggie.
Who are you liking?

35:50.081 --> 35:52.081
It's Billy Hawkins comes from
a Virginian line

35:52.083 --> 35:53.783
- with deep confederate roots.
- How deep?

35:53.785 --> 35:55.184
His great-great-granddad
is Jefferson Davis.

35:55.186 --> 35:56.819
- Deep.
- His family bought

35:56.821 --> 35:58.922
a ton of land from the
Choctaw in Mississippi.

35:58.924 --> 36:00.723
Now his roommate, Cooper,
interesting case.

36:00.725 --> 36:02.258
Billy's bringing out
a lot out in him,

36:02.260 --> 36:03.993
but the whole fuckjerry
thing, I mean,

36:03.995 --> 36:05.828
"hashtag Nick Cooper is sad,"
it's just depressing.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.830
Benjamin, how does
this make you feel?

36:07.832 --> 36:09.866
- Fuck fuckjerry.
- It's press.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.801
- He's a Jew.
- It's good press.

36:11.803 --> 36:13.670
- It's Jew press.
- What press isn't?

36:13.672 --> 36:15.338
But keep in mind that his family

36:15.340 --> 36:16.839
is the Cooper tire family.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.808
- Nationals would love that.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:18.810 --> 36:21.678
- I'm not sure about this kid.
- I'm with Auggie on this one.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.580
Hey, I like
the Cooper tire connection.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.248
I think it says a lot.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.916
What're we planning
for the pledges?

36:26.918 --> 36:29.619
Brothers,

36:29.621 --> 36:31.154
I have deep concerns.

36:31.156 --> 36:32.989
Over the past few years,

36:32.991 --> 36:35.959
we've gone soft on pledges,
and as a result,

36:35.961 --> 36:38.962
our house has become
a gaping receptacle.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.965
Our front door,
it's loose, sloppy.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.833
- Flabby.
- That's why I want

36:43.835 --> 36:45.935
our next pledge class

36:45.937 --> 36:48.705
to be the white hot
cream of the crop.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.608
I want that white hot cream
all over this house.

36:51.610 --> 36:52.942
- All over us.
- Yeah.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.011
I want to ride
these pledges hard.

36:55.013 --> 36:57.146
I want to ride 'em harder
during hell week,

36:57.148 --> 37:00.717
and I want the hunt
to be kinkier, riskier,

37:00.719 --> 37:02.852
- and I want to see more paddlings.
- Yeah.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.021
I wanna ride
those pledges so hard,

37:05.023 --> 37:06.889
they're on all fours,

37:06.891 --> 37:10.326
begging us, in the name of
Phidelt, "please stop."

37:10.328 --> 37:13.763
And that, my brothers,

37:13.765 --> 37:14.964
is how you get the most

37:14.966 --> 37:18.334
premium, exquisite pledge class,

37:18.336 --> 37:21.237
molded in our bare hands

37:21.239 --> 37:22.939
like supple Clay.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.341
From a gentile fountain.

37:26.844 --> 37:29.012
All right, now listen up,
you candyasses.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.647
You guys made it this far

37:30.649 --> 37:34.150
and to that I say
congratufuckinglations, huh?

37:34.152 --> 37:37.687
That just means
from here on out,

37:37.689 --> 37:40.289
everything you have
is yours to lose.

37:40.291 --> 37:41.758
For the next few weeks,

37:41.760 --> 37:43.426
you guys are going
to have to prove

37:43.428 --> 37:45.228
every bit of your worth.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.930
You guys have
a golden opportunity

37:47.932 --> 37:51.167
to become members of the group
of the most influential people

37:51.169 --> 37:53.169
ever birthed by
our great nation.

37:53.171 --> 37:54.871
Chester a. Arthur.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.873
Nelson a. Rockefeller.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.708
Leona Helmsley's dog.

37:58.710 --> 37:59.942
- Woof.
- Yeah.

37:59.944 --> 38:04.781
Michael bay,
and of course, my dad.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.949
- Let's go.
- A-ho!

38:06.951 --> 38:09.285
- Chong Chang.
- Chong has the potential

38:09.287 --> 38:12.155
to be the next Len fang.
He got a five on every AP.

38:12.157 --> 38:13.990
One of two kids
in the world to do it,

38:13.992 --> 38:16.059
the other being Spencer
Reid from "criminal minds."

38:18.697 --> 38:20.897
Jamarcus Johnson,
St. Paul's.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.198
All hail token.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.367
- Oh, yes!
- Token? Cute.

38:24.369 --> 38:26.936
Chad Grazier.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.871
Now Chad here is a specimen.

38:28.873 --> 38:33.176
6'4", 220, 210. Hell,
once we've all moved on,

38:33.178 --> 38:36.279
Chad might have a chance at
being the face of the house.

38:36.281 --> 38:38.414
Oh, my god.

38:39.917 --> 38:44.253
Whoa!
Mind the wing tips, bro!

38:44.255 --> 38:45.922
JT.

38:45.924 --> 38:48.791
JT's dad got a beej
from Cindy Crawford once.

38:48.793 --> 38:51.194
In that case, I'll let it slide.

38:52.963 --> 38:55.164
Uh, Jake.

38:55.166 --> 38:58.735
His dad owns the 54th largest yacht
in the world, named "très Riche."

38:58.737 --> 39:02.371
I know what
we're doing for spring break.

39:02.373 --> 39:04.040
Zachary Rockefeller.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.908
Greenwich country day,
then Brunswick,

39:05.910 --> 39:07.910
then transferred to deerfield,

39:07.912 --> 39:10.780
- then PGED at Taft.
- Whoa, calm down sailor,

39:10.782 --> 39:12.115
that's a hell of a resume.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.984
You guys could take
a note or two.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.987
Billy Hawkins,
the Whitehall university,

39:17.989 --> 39:20.857
honor to be here, sir!

39:20.859 --> 39:23.092
What're you gonna bring
to the Phidelts.

39:23.094 --> 39:25.762
Ya know, other than Cooper.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.131
Nick Cooper.

39:28.133 --> 39:31.000
How much interaction do you have
with the family business?

39:31.002 --> 39:33.536
I work at dad's plant
in the summer, why?

39:33.538 --> 39:36.072
Ah, start at the bottom,
learn the business,

39:36.074 --> 39:37.774
working your way to the top.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.041
I like that.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.249
This is my favorite party.

39:46.251 --> 39:48.117
We had so much fun last year.

39:48.119 --> 39:49.852
You spent four hours
throwing up off the front porch.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.788
I know!

39:51.790 --> 39:53.456
So who are you gonna hook
up with tonight, Courtney?

39:53.458 --> 39:55.458
- Anyone who's fresh meat.
- That's my girl.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.326
I think the real question is,

39:57.328 --> 39:59.862
who's our little Princess
Rosanna gonna hook up with?

39:59.864 --> 40:01.364
Nobody!

40:01.366 --> 40:03.366
- She's so judgmental.
- She's super prudish.

40:03.368 --> 40:05.468
I know. I feel like she
was really mean to me.

40:05.470 --> 40:07.370
She doesn't have
any ZB qualities.

40:07.372 --> 40:08.905
Well, we'll just have to see

40:08.907 --> 40:12.475
if she can become
a beautiful ZB swan.

40:12.477 --> 40:14.510
Mm, so...

40:16.914 --> 40:19.315
- That's a nice top.
- Why, thank you.

40:27.224 --> 40:30.493
I just wanted you to know
that tonight,

40:30.495 --> 40:32.428
I slay Nick Cooper.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.409
Oh, Rosie, Rosie, Rosie,
what's the matter?

40:46.411 --> 40:48.044
I just don't get it.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.112
You guys begged me
to tell you who I like

40:50.114 --> 40:53.449
and the one guy I say I'm
interested in is the one guy

40:53.451 --> 40:55.318
that Courtney has to go after.

40:55.320 --> 40:58.020
Yeah, Rosanna.
This isn't about Nick.

40:58.022 --> 41:00.356
It's about the ZB way of life.

41:00.358 --> 41:02.291
And if you can't handle it,

41:02.293 --> 41:04.961
I'm sure the kappas
would be happy to have you.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.035
All right,
Mr. Cooper!

41:13.037 --> 41:15.905
We have seven parties
this upcoming fortnight.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.241
You are to get laid
no matter what.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.976
I don't wanna hear
that she was crying

41:19.978 --> 41:22.144
or that she was sad
or that she was asleep.

41:22.146 --> 41:24.313
- Do you understand me?
- Aye aye, captain.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.983
Operation fortnight commence.

41:33.991 --> 41:37.159
Mr. Cooper,
consider an offering.

41:37.161 --> 41:39.328
You've done it.

42:06.056 --> 42:07.390
How you doing?

42:07.392 --> 42:08.991
I'm doing fine.

42:08.993 --> 42:10.359
You look like a cat.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.995
Jungle kitty cat.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.571
Do me, fucking jungle cat.

42:22.573 --> 42:24.006
Meow.

42:37.221 --> 42:39.088
I'm not ordained, though.

42:39.090 --> 42:40.690
Oh my gosh,
Mr. Nick!

42:40.692 --> 42:42.058
What?

42:42.060 --> 42:44.627
- Oh my god!
- Ahh!

42:44.629 --> 42:47.363
Ahh!

42:47.365 --> 42:48.698
Get me some bangers!

42:48.700 --> 42:50.599
Boom and boom and boom.

42:50.601 --> 42:52.501
- How are ya, Billy?
- Good.

42:52.503 --> 42:54.236
It's good to see you.

42:54.238 --> 42:55.738
I have been thinking about you

42:55.740 --> 42:58.341
- ever since you left, man.
- Oh, stop it.

42:58.343 --> 43:00.042
This is who I've been
talking about!

43:00.044 --> 43:01.644
Oh, stop it.
Stop it.

43:01.646 --> 43:03.245
Oh, man.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.014
- Hey listen, Nick.
- Yeah.

43:05.016 --> 43:07.616
Do me a favor. Um, can
you fetch me a cocktail?

43:07.618 --> 43:09.151
Anything, anything
they got over there.

43:09.153 --> 43:10.486
- Yeah.
- Whatever they got.

43:10.488 --> 43:11.554
How's the kid doing?

43:11.556 --> 43:13.122
- Nick?
- Yeah.

43:13.124 --> 43:14.457
Oh my god.
The best.

43:14.459 --> 43:16.659
- Yeah.
- Every day, every day.

43:16.661 --> 43:18.160
- Every day.
- That's because of you.

43:18.162 --> 43:20.029
- No, it's us.
- No, it's you.

43:20.031 --> 43:22.031
- What're you guys talking about?
- There he is.

43:22.033 --> 43:23.699
There he is.
Here's to the new Nick.

43:23.701 --> 43:25.368
- To the new Nick.
- Hey, to the transformation!

43:25.370 --> 43:26.435
Okay!

43:49.193 --> 43:50.526
Adam, hello.

43:50.528 --> 43:52.061
- Billy, how's it going?
- Mr. president.

43:52.063 --> 43:53.662
You don't have a jacket
or anything more formal?

43:53.664 --> 43:55.164
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey Adam, Mr. president.

43:55.166 --> 43:56.799
How're you doing, Nick?
Good to see you.

43:56.801 --> 43:58.501
This is Mr. Nick.

43:58.503 --> 44:00.036
- My dad.
- I'm the dad.

44:00.038 --> 44:01.337
Nice to meet you, I'm Adam.

44:01.339 --> 44:03.105
- Augustus.
- Augustus.

44:03.107 --> 44:04.440
- You having a good time?
- What a pleasure.

44:04.442 --> 44:05.775
I'm having a lovely time.

44:05.777 --> 44:07.777
It's really fun to be back here.

44:07.779 --> 44:09.779
I'm not sure if you can tell,
Adam, but Mr. Nick here

44:09.781 --> 44:12.148
- is an alum.
- An alum?

44:12.150 --> 44:13.482
- Well, yes.
- He's being humble.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.484
Was kind of...
Kind of kicked out in '89.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.787
You're not fucking talking about
the Halloween of '89!?

44:17.789 --> 44:19.789
- Well, I didn't want to say it!
- That was you!

44:19.791 --> 44:21.657
I told you about that year.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.459
Do you remember when I was
fucking telling you about that?

44:23.461 --> 44:25.327
Tell that story.
You gotta tell the story.

44:25.329 --> 44:27.329
It's no big deal. The school,
I think, overreacted

44:27.331 --> 44:29.665
just a little bit. Um, we had
some pledges and, uh, you know,

44:29.667 --> 44:31.534
we hollowed out some pumpkins.

44:31.536 --> 44:33.436
- It was Halloween!
- Come on, what'd you do?

44:33.438 --> 44:35.304
We put 'em on their heads.

44:35.306 --> 44:37.807
You know, we carved some
faces into the pumpkins.

44:37.809 --> 44:39.442
The only problem was that,

44:39.444 --> 44:42.344
you know, some of the
kids lost some eyes.

44:42.346 --> 44:45.247
One of the kids was missing one
when he went into the thing, so.

44:45.249 --> 44:47.416
You enhanced all four
of his other senses,

44:47.418 --> 44:48.751
- by yourself!
- Exactly.

44:48.753 --> 44:50.719
Thank you very much
for saying that.

44:50.721 --> 44:52.755
We can't even hold kids under
water for like two minutes.

44:52.757 --> 44:54.757
I am like fully erect right now.

44:54.759 --> 44:56.258
Yes!

44:56.260 --> 44:57.760
Listen.
I, um,

44:57.762 --> 45:00.696
- noticed here, a table.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.531
- For an alum.
- Yeah.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.300
Whoa!

45:04.302 --> 45:06.302
Mr. Nick wants to play some
pong, ladies and gentleman!

45:06.304 --> 45:09.271
I... I don't want to,
you know, screw up

45:09.273 --> 45:11.273
- somebody else's game.
- No, no, no.

45:11.275 --> 45:13.275
Here we go...

45:13.277 --> 45:14.610
Come on, come on, come on.

45:14.612 --> 45:15.878
And bangers!

45:20.450 --> 45:22.251
Now, it's time
to see if your bodies

45:22.253 --> 45:24.153
are up to the ZB standard.

45:24.155 --> 45:26.555
- Let's go robot pussies!
- Let's go robots!

45:26.557 --> 45:27.857
Pussy!

45:27.859 --> 45:30.559
If you gain weight, you're out.

45:30.561 --> 45:33.295
What is pain?

45:33.297 --> 45:35.631
If you get acne, you're out.

45:38.835 --> 45:40.736
And if you
don't survive tonight,

45:40.738 --> 45:42.338
you'll never be in.

45:42.340 --> 45:45.808
I feel no pain, sir!

45:45.810 --> 45:48.544
I am Phidelt's reckoning!

45:48.546 --> 45:51.547
- Look at this robot.
- Good job, team! Good job!

45:51.549 --> 45:54.250
- Good job!
- Yes, sir!

45:54.252 --> 45:56.552
As you'll kindly note,

45:56.554 --> 45:58.654
in this short film,
no men appear.

45:58.656 --> 46:01.223
You're to sit on a roll,
and in 20 minutes,

46:01.225 --> 46:04.226
we're gonna judge
which roll is the wettest.

46:04.228 --> 46:05.895
Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink!

46:05.897 --> 46:07.696
Drink!

46:07.698 --> 46:09.231
Drink! Drink!

46:20.243 --> 46:22.244
Open up wide.

46:22.246 --> 46:24.647
Here comes the airplane,
here comes the airplane!

46:24.649 --> 46:25.915
Onward!

46:28.552 --> 46:29.818
Yes!

46:31.721 --> 46:34.323
Phidelt!

46:41.364 --> 46:44.400
So I don't think I've asked you yet.
Where do you summer?

46:44.402 --> 46:47.303
The Hamptons.

46:47.305 --> 46:48.470
Yeah, but which one?

46:48.472 --> 46:49.872
I dabble.

46:49.874 --> 46:51.874
Oh token,
Hampton bay is having a sale.

46:51.876 --> 46:53.943
You should get on that.

47:18.635 --> 47:21.570
Hey Nick, take a
break, get some air.

47:22.906 --> 47:25.274
I want to tell you

47:25.276 --> 47:27.943
what a good job you've been doing.
Splendid.

47:27.945 --> 47:30.946
I'm pleasantly surprised,
and I don't say that.

47:30.948 --> 47:33.816
I mean, when I met your father,

47:33.818 --> 47:36.719
the Cooper of Cooper tires...

47:38.455 --> 47:40.456
I'm glad you're
one of the good ones,

47:40.458 --> 47:42.625
a pureblood.

47:42.627 --> 47:44.827
And, uh,

47:44.829 --> 47:48.530
there's a lot of eyes on you,

47:48.532 --> 47:51.567
so don't fuck this up.

47:51.569 --> 47:53.936
That's all.

47:58.542 --> 48:01.644
So what're you guys
talking about?

48:01.646 --> 48:03.012
Auggie fucked a pregnant woman.

48:03.014 --> 48:04.980
- Again?
- Yeah.

48:04.982 --> 48:07.316
The best part
about pregnant chicks:

48:07.318 --> 48:09.952
They can't get pregnant.

48:09.954 --> 48:12.488
Hey Auggie, you still have
that lactation fetish?

48:12.490 --> 48:13.822
Yeah.

48:13.824 --> 48:14.990
- Yes!
- Yeah!

48:16.994 --> 48:18.527
- It feels good.
- Yeah.

48:18.529 --> 48:19.695
- Does that feel good?
- Yeah.

48:19.697 --> 48:22.564
- Feels so fucking good.
- Yeah. Yeah.

48:36.546 --> 48:39.882
- I gotta go.
- What? Nick.

48:39.884 --> 48:42.751
What?

48:42.753 --> 48:45.387
I want you to show me
that thing you can do.

48:45.389 --> 48:48.023
I'm tired, baby.

48:48.025 --> 48:49.491
Come on.

48:49.493 --> 48:51.493
I want you to make me come.

48:51.495 --> 48:53.662
What's in it for me, huh?

48:53.664 --> 48:56.865
I'll tell you what our little
whore Rosanna has been up to.

48:58.768 --> 49:01.704
What's Rosanna been up to?

49:01.706 --> 49:03.939
Lots of bad things.

49:05.642 --> 49:06.975
Tell me.

49:06.977 --> 49:08.510
I will.

49:08.512 --> 49:10.379
But you first.

49:17.721 --> 49:21.423
- Really, what's Rosanna...
- No, no, shh. Shh. Shh. Shh.

49:23.960 --> 49:25.828
- Tonight is the night.
- Fuck yeah, it's the night.

49:25.830 --> 49:27.363
- Are you ready?
- I'm fucking ready.

49:27.365 --> 49:28.831
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

49:28.833 --> 49:31.367
This...
We're done with this.

49:31.369 --> 49:32.668
We're done with that!

50:44.942 --> 50:46.942
Ah! Beer for you, my friend.

50:46.944 --> 50:48.477
Come here and give me that shit.

50:48.479 --> 50:50.145
My broski.

50:50.147 --> 50:52.981
- Ugh! Dude. -That was
fucking nuts last night.

50:52.983 --> 50:54.683
That was incredible.

50:54.685 --> 50:57.019
You were incredible.

50:57.021 --> 50:58.554
- Cheers to you.
- Cheers to you, Mr. Hawkins.

50:58.556 --> 51:00.022
To Mr. Cooper!

51:00.024 --> 51:02.624
Boys, freshmen first orgy.

51:02.626 --> 51:04.159
Time-honored
Phidelt tradition.

51:04.161 --> 51:06.028
That's right. Hey, not
my first orgy though.

51:06.030 --> 51:07.563
No, but it's your first
with a pregnant chick.

51:07.565 --> 51:09.097
Let's hope.

51:09.099 --> 51:11.066
I was on my yacht once and this
pregnant chick went into labor.

51:11.068 --> 51:13.602
Ooh, still gets me hard
thinking about it.

51:13.604 --> 51:15.471
I can top that.
So one time,

51:15.473 --> 51:16.972
I was having an orgy
on a private jet,

51:16.974 --> 51:20.142
- with my dad.
- Mr. Nick.

51:20.144 --> 51:21.844
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Shush up.

51:21.846 --> 51:23.045
We're here on official business.

51:23.047 --> 51:25.948
We see what you all are doing,

51:25.950 --> 51:28.016
and we like what we see.

51:30.820 --> 51:33.789
Winners get to choose
the room that they want,

51:33.791 --> 51:35.824
way over the underclassmen.

51:39.529 --> 51:41.530
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

51:41.532 --> 51:42.865
- Don't thank him.
- Boys, let's go.

51:42.867 --> 51:45.133
- Hell, yeah.
- Not you.

51:48.705 --> 51:51.907
All right, line up, boners.

51:51.909 --> 51:53.809
Let's go.

51:57.046 --> 51:58.814
Ariel, what is the location

51:58.816 --> 52:01.049
of the famous phi delta chapter

52:01.051 --> 52:03.785
that threw
the Nazi-Negroes party?

52:03.787 --> 52:05.120
New York?

52:05.122 --> 52:06.655
Wrong!

52:06.657 --> 52:08.223
Token,

52:08.225 --> 52:09.925
what is best flavor of Gatorade

52:09.927 --> 52:12.528
scientifically proven
to cure hangovers?

52:12.530 --> 52:14.730
- Lemon-lime?
- Blue!

52:16.232 --> 52:19.801
JT, what scent of
Cologne am I wearing?

52:19.803 --> 52:23.539
Is it Davidoff cool water
or axe instinct?

52:23.541 --> 52:25.874
- Cool water. -It's
fucking Dior Fahrenheit

52:25.876 --> 52:27.910
you olfactory retard!

52:33.283 --> 52:36.285
What's the best TV show
of all time?

52:36.287 --> 52:37.753
Um, "gossip girl."

52:37.755 --> 52:40.088
"Entourage"!

52:40.090 --> 52:41.857
What is the best band
of all time?

52:41.859 --> 52:44.259
- Coldplay!
- Mumford and sons!

52:46.095 --> 52:49.631
What is the best adjective of
all time, ching Chang Chong?

52:49.633 --> 52:51.633
Rovingry.

52:51.635 --> 52:53.135
What?

52:53.137 --> 52:54.303
Rovingry.

52:54.305 --> 52:56.271
What are you saying?

52:56.273 --> 52:58.340
- I think it's lovingly.
- Wrong!

52:58.342 --> 53:00.208
It's "epic"!

53:00.210 --> 53:03.011
As in you epically don't
know how to talk right.

53:03.013 --> 53:05.147
What is the best movie
of all time?

53:05.149 --> 53:06.682
"Eyes wide shut," sir.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.917
"Boondock saints," trebeck.

53:08.919 --> 53:10.218
Fuck!

53:10.220 --> 53:15.791
"There was a fire fight!"

53:15.793 --> 53:19.294
Nick, I swear to god,
if you miss this question,

53:19.296 --> 53:21.196
I'm gonna buy you a little puppy

53:21.198 --> 53:23.932
and make sure you two form
an inseparable bond.

53:23.934 --> 53:25.634
And then I'm gonna murder him,

53:25.636 --> 53:27.970
right in front of your face!

53:27.972 --> 53:29.972
What is the name
of the Phidelt alum

53:29.974 --> 53:32.908
who invented the flesh light?

53:32.910 --> 53:36.078
Mmm.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.913
Shit. It's on the
tip of my tongue.

53:37.915 --> 53:39.781
- Uh, uh, uh.
- Uh! Uh! Uh!

53:39.783 --> 53:41.283
Uh uh duh!
Duh duh.

53:41.285 --> 53:43.018
- Anthony, Anthony something.
- Anthony!

53:43.020 --> 53:45.954
It's a softball Nick.
It's a softball!

53:52.129 --> 53:54.129
Seriously?

53:54.131 --> 53:55.664
Seriously?!

53:55.666 --> 53:57.966
You fucks!

53:57.968 --> 54:01.737
Did nobody read fucking
page one of the handbook?

54:01.739 --> 54:03.839
All of these answers and more

54:03.841 --> 54:05.907
are in the fucking handbook,
Nick!

54:05.909 --> 54:08.310
Because they are integral
to being the kind of man

54:08.312 --> 54:10.045
that a Phidelt needs to be!

54:10.047 --> 54:11.680
Seriously?

54:11.682 --> 54:13.215
Why the fuck are you
smirking at me, Billy?

54:13.217 --> 54:14.950
I will rip your lips off

54:14.952 --> 54:18.887
and I will staple them
right to the pledge banner!

54:18.889 --> 54:22.257
You guys think being a Phidelt's
all about having fun.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.793
Look at me.
I'm Rockefeller.

54:24.795 --> 54:28.430
I have a fucking
sacagawea coin tie clip.

54:28.432 --> 54:31.133
Fuck Greenwich and fuck you!

54:31.135 --> 54:34.670
All of you idiots
think this is fun and games?

54:34.672 --> 54:38.140
You think it's all snorting
coke and banging hussies?

54:38.142 --> 54:40.842
It's about smarts!

54:40.844 --> 54:42.878
Oh, my god, you are so dumb.

54:42.880 --> 54:44.880
I bet you got held back
in kindergarten,

54:44.882 --> 54:46.748
'cause you couldn't
bounce a ball!

54:46.750 --> 54:48.750
You think you belong
in the Phidelts?

54:48.752 --> 54:50.085
What's that smell?

54:50.087 --> 54:52.087
Do I smell ozone burning?

54:52.089 --> 54:55.090
Oh, I guess you must be
trying to think,

54:55.092 --> 54:57.693
you fucking small ears,
inbred fuck!

54:57.695 --> 54:59.194
If I were an asshole,

54:59.196 --> 55:01.763
I'd lock every single one
of you in the basement

55:01.765 --> 55:04.266
and have you beaten with
an oar every 15 minutes

55:04.268 --> 55:06.968
until you were in shape!

55:06.970 --> 55:08.470
But JT down there
is hooking up with

55:08.472 --> 55:10.338
Stephanie's little tonight,

55:10.340 --> 55:12.140
and I'm not a cock block,

55:12.142 --> 55:16.011
because I read rule 246
in the handbook

55:16.013 --> 55:18.213
and I know how to be a man!

55:18.215 --> 55:20.916
Ben, I cannot fucking
do this anymore,

55:20.918 --> 55:22.784
I'm going to burst
a blood vessel in my eye,

55:22.786 --> 55:24.119
and I'm gonna fucking go blind.

55:24.121 --> 55:26.088
I got it, Prez, you did good.

55:26.090 --> 55:27.789
"Gentilemen."

55:27.791 --> 55:30.859
There will be an exam
at 5:00 A.M.

55:32.195 --> 55:33.829
If you score under 89 percent...

55:33.831 --> 55:35.330
98.

55:35.332 --> 55:37.866
98 percent...

55:37.868 --> 55:39.367
You're done.

55:39.369 --> 55:41.403
Will this be graded on a curve?

55:43.506 --> 55:46.041
No, it won't be graded
on a curve.

55:46.043 --> 55:49.778
It'll be graded on a slant.

55:49.780 --> 55:53.115
Try some scope, Nick.

55:53.117 --> 55:55.450
'Cause you're breath
smells like dicks!

55:59.922 --> 56:01.323
Never have I ever,

56:01.325 --> 56:03.825
tried to suck
my own fucking dick.

56:03.827 --> 56:06.194
- Come on, dude. -Everyone's
tried at least once.

56:06.196 --> 56:08.196
- Gotta try it once.
- All right, all right.

56:08.198 --> 56:10.065
Never have I ever,

56:10.067 --> 56:12.400
fucked a girl over 200 pounds.

56:12.402 --> 56:15.470
Oh, what about two 100-pound
girls, at the same time?

56:15.472 --> 56:17.592
Nah, nah, bro, that doesn't count.
That doesn't count.

56:19.475 --> 56:21.476
Hey, don't stop on
account of me.

56:21.478 --> 56:23.178
You wouldn't happen to be
talking about how the mugs

56:23.180 --> 56:25.981
aren't frosted, would you?

56:25.983 --> 56:27.315
'Cause, Chad, I'm pretty sure
somebody told you

56:27.317 --> 56:29.017
to throw the mugs
in the freezer.

56:29.019 --> 56:31.019
All right, why don't you
step up your game?

56:31.021 --> 56:34.289
- Get a little self-respect.
- Self-respect!

56:34.291 --> 56:36.258
Anyway, unpleasantries aside,

56:36.260 --> 56:40.128
tonight is a very
important event, the hunt.

56:40.130 --> 56:42.430
I "rove" me a scavenger
hunt, so exciting!

56:42.432 --> 56:45.200
Hey, hey. This isn't like
those pansy-ass scavenger hunts

56:45.202 --> 56:47.202
you used to do over
at greylock, okay?

56:47.204 --> 56:48.537
Where you'd make snow angels,

56:48.539 --> 56:50.071
roll around in the grass,
find a Twix bar

56:50.073 --> 56:51.506
and think about shoving it
up your own ass.

56:51.508 --> 56:53.108
Nah.

56:53.110 --> 56:55.110
This is the real deal.

56:55.112 --> 56:58.446
This is more like putting
a Twix bar in a twat.

56:58.448 --> 57:00.515
There are 12 tasks tonight

57:00.517 --> 57:03.552
and each one becomes more
difficult than the last.

57:03.554 --> 57:06.521
The final task,

57:06.523 --> 57:10.292
that's what really separates
the geeds from the Greeks.

57:10.294 --> 57:12.460
The truffle butter.

57:12.462 --> 57:15.063
Oh, a little tartufo Nero.

57:15.065 --> 57:17.399
Well, you know what
that means, gentlemen.

57:24.273 --> 57:27.075
We must protect this house!

57:30.414 --> 57:32.447
To the moon!

57:35.351 --> 57:37.352
All right, boys, task six.

57:37.354 --> 57:39.154
One of us has to go
down on a black sister.

57:39.156 --> 57:41.389
- Yes!
- I can do this.

57:41.391 --> 57:43.091
Chong, what the fuck
is your plan?

57:43.093 --> 57:45.427
- Because this is important.
- Okay, I go to door,

57:45.429 --> 57:47.562
- yeah. -I tell her my
name Ryan gosling...

57:47.564 --> 57:50.332
- Oh, that's good.
- And I eat her pussy.

57:50.334 --> 57:53.034
Okay, go do it.

57:58.307 --> 58:01.076
I'm gonna fuck your hand!

58:04.247 --> 58:05.947
Give me a leaf!
Give me a leaf!

58:05.949 --> 58:07.549
- Go, go!
- Just do it.

58:21.430 --> 58:23.965
Hey, Courtney.

58:23.967 --> 58:25.634
It's Nick.

58:25.636 --> 58:27.202
Hey.

58:35.945 --> 58:38.613
Ugh! Uh.

58:38.615 --> 58:40.548
Oh.

58:43.252 --> 58:44.586
Hey.

58:44.588 --> 58:46.121
Can you like open your legs

58:46.123 --> 58:47.622
just like a little bit
or something?

58:47.624 --> 58:49.491
What're you doing?

58:49.493 --> 58:51.359
I'm on a mission.

58:51.361 --> 58:54.229
I'm gonna fuck you in the ass.

58:54.231 --> 58:57.098
- Oh, god.
- What?

58:59.102 --> 59:01.503
You've never done this
before, have you?

59:01.505 --> 59:03.505
There's a first time
for everything.

59:03.507 --> 59:05.473
Hold on.

59:20.056 --> 59:21.723
Oh, my...

59:23.193 --> 59:25.026
Wanna join us?

59:25.028 --> 59:27.095
I'm good.

59:29.231 --> 59:30.732
Ugh.

59:30.734 --> 59:34.402
This is a mission, isn't it?

59:34.404 --> 59:36.271
If you don't complete,

59:36.273 --> 59:39.007
you don't get in, pwief.

59:43.679 --> 59:46.381
And I believe you just
broke into my room

59:46.383 --> 59:48.550
and stuck your dick in me,

59:48.552 --> 59:51.086
which is kind of grounds
for getting expelled,

59:51.088 --> 59:52.554
don't you think?

59:52.556 --> 59:55.090
- Courtney...

59:55.092 --> 59:57.425
You're a nasty whore.

59:57.427 --> 59:59.761
Hmm, I know.

59:59.763 --> 01:00:02.297
Fuck me or get expelled.

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:04.466
Your choice.

01:01:14.136 --> 01:01:15.670
Welcome back.

01:01:17.406 --> 01:01:19.274
Something wrong, Cooper?

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:21.609
Yeah, Cooper, you're
looking a little pale.

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:24.145
You don't look too well.
You look peaked.

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:25.480
Is everything all right?

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:26.815
What's, what's going on?

01:01:30.419 --> 01:01:33.288
Holy shit.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.623
You failed the hunt.

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:38.259
You didn't do the last
task of the hunt, did you?

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:39.427
I did it.

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:41.696
God damn it, Cooper!

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.565
You better not lie to me, Nick!

01:01:43.567 --> 01:01:45.100
- I did it.
- You're a liar.

01:01:45.102 --> 01:01:47.802
You're lying
because you're a liar.

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:50.705
How many times did I tell you
how important this was?

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:52.674
- A lot.
- A lot?

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:54.676
Please, for the love of all
that is good and holy,

01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:56.744
- give me a ballpark, token.
- A thousand. A thousand.

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:59.881
A thousand times, Cooper!

01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:03.818
This matters,
doesn't this matter to you?

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.254
Don't you... aren't you
taking this seriously?

01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:09.124
You were supposed to be
the chosen one!

01:02:09.126 --> 01:02:12.360
I was ready to be your brother.

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:15.463
I would've flown with you, Nick,

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:18.466
like a bald eagle
on the wings of a dream,

01:02:18.468 --> 01:02:21.569
land on a rainbow
and slide down the side

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.571
till we found the pot of gold.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:26.508
I would've traveled back
in time with you, Cooper,

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:27.842
dressed you like a redskin

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:30.378
and put a buckle hat on
and sat down next to you

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.547
at the first Thanksgiving feast!

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:36.851
I can't believe you.

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:42.323
You suck balls.

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:44.259
And I wanna hear you say it.

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:47.428
Say it!

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:50.665
I suck balls.

01:02:50.667 --> 01:02:52.433
Say it again.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:56.371
I suck balls.

01:02:56.373 --> 01:02:58.373
No, you don't.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:04.512
You suck big salty balls.

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:09.284
- Say it.
- I suck big salty balls.

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:11.853
Say it to me
while I'm over here.

01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:14.389
I suck big salty balls.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.424
Say it like you mean it!

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:18.526
I suck big salty balls!

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:20.828
Yeah you do, and you like it,

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.430
'cause you're weird.

01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:24.899
You know what?

01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:27.835
You're a failure,

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:31.372
and sometimes
when people are failures,

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:34.542
it can be really help
for them to just accept it,

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.311
and admit it

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.479
to themselves and to the
people around them.

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:39.814
That's biblical.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:42.350
So why don't you tell me

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:44.986
that you're a failure, Nick.

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.521
Just tell me.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:48.523
Just right here, you and me.

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:50.225
Just look in my eyes

01:03:50.227 --> 01:03:53.228
and tell me
that you're a failure.

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:55.496
- I'm a failure.
- A what?

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.599
What, what was that?
Just a little bit louder.

01:03:57.601 --> 01:03:58.933
I'm a failure.

01:03:58.935 --> 01:04:00.835
- Louder!
- I'm a failure!

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.503
- Say it again!
- I'm a failure!

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:04.439
I'm just kidding dude,
I'm just kidding, bro.

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:07.408
No, this is a joke.
His face!

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:08.910
No, because you, you
couldn't see your face.

01:04:08.912 --> 01:04:10.612
That was a good face.

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:13.014
- Dude.
- Oh, relax, Cooper.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.316
- It couldn't have been that bad.
- Yeah, man.

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:17.819
The crinkled star's ruined many
a better dude than you, douche.

01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:21.656
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to
get into the brown star.

01:04:21.658 --> 01:04:23.358
- I understand.
- But do you though?

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.926
'Cause he's not yelling at you
like he's yelling at me.

01:04:24.928 --> 01:04:26.794
Yeah, but they do it
just to get in your head, man,

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:28.663
- that's what it's about.
- No, it's some kind of game.

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:30.365
It's something that I'm
just not getting, you know.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.567
Like...
You know what I think.

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:35.603
I think what it is it's
him giving me more shit,

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:36.838
'cause I'm number one pledge.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.473
And I think
I gotta take the shit

01:04:38.475 --> 01:04:40.008
that everybody else
is fucking...

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:41.376
Yeah, no, I don't
think that's true.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:42.577
I think you're overreacting.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:43.978
I think we just all need
to just calm down.

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.980
I think he's giving
everyone shit

01:04:45.982 --> 01:04:47.982
and you're taking it all on yourself
and you just need to relax.

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:50.551
- Everything's gonna be fine, Nick.
- I'm not overreacting.

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:51.786
There's no time to be chill

01:04:51.788 --> 01:04:53.421
and "everything's
gonna be fine."

01:04:53.423 --> 01:04:54.956
We gotta move quick,
they're making decisions.

01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:56.524
We're running out of time.

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:57.792
Who's making decisions
about anything, man?

01:04:57.794 --> 01:04:59.460
Look at Rockefeller.

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:00.995
All he does
is sit on those steps

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:02.730
and he puts his hair there
and he goes like this,

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.565
and he's gonna
get in no problem.

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:05.933
Yeah, because it's Rockefeller.

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:05.933
He doesn't have to try.

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:08.803
No, I'm talking about the guys
who do have to try,

01:05:08.805 --> 01:05:10.305
like Chong, and JT,

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:12.707
- and Jake, and you.
- You think I try?

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:14.642
Let me give you some advice,
all right?

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:17.378
Nobody wants to hang out
with the desperate guy.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.082
- I'm the desperate guy?
- I'm not calling you anything.

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:23.084
I'm simply acknowledging
what I'm seeing

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:25.086
and asking you just to relax.

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:26.921
You know what I think?

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.724
I think you need to
step it up to my level.

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:33.361
What?

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:37.799
I'm going out.

01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:39.334
Okay.

01:05:39.336 --> 01:05:41.569
Well, you text me
if you need anything.

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:45.940
Jesus Christ.

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:48.109
- I'm so fucking tired.
- Oh, is that shit pure?

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:49.877
I'm not snorting any more
of your Adderall.

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:51.879
Yeah, I got it from my fucking driver.
He's Dominican.

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:54.882
- Can you lay off, okay?
- I want that.

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:57.418
What's the difference
between a man's man

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.753
and a ladies' man?

01:05:58.755 --> 01:06:00.988
A man's man trumps ladies' man.

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:03.358
All right,
well, if you're wrong.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.792
Rockefeller,
why're you even studying?

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.661
You could kill someone here,
they'd let you in.

01:06:06.663 --> 01:06:09.497
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You know exactly what it means.

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:11.599
If it were Chong's family,
it'd be fucking nepotism.

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.134
Oh, shut up!

01:06:13.136 --> 01:06:15.670
You're guaranteed a spot,
you fucking porch monkey.

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:17.538
Read between the lines, ass.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.707
- Guys.
- What up, baby?

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:21.042
If one of us fails,

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:22.744
should we all drop it together?

01:06:22.746 --> 01:06:26.447
Shut the fuck up, Chad.
Go dream of dudes, fag.

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:28.116
Amanda's fat.

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:30.818
Um, yeah.
She's out.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.488
What did she think she was doing
bingeing like a kappa?

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:35.156
I know, right?

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:38.159
Thank god we don't have to
be seen with her anymore.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:40.161
Ah, Melissa, Rosie,
what's good, ladies?

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:42.530
- Hey.
- Hi, Rosanna.

01:06:42.532 --> 01:06:44.532
Nick says hi.
We were talking about you.

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:46.667
Totally wish
you'd stayed and joined.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:49.137
Have you finally gotten the full
Nick Cooper experience?

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:52.106
- Oh, yeah.
- That's my girl.

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:54.642
What're you trying to do?

01:06:54.644 --> 01:06:58.045
I'm trying to teach you
a lesson, girl.

01:06:58.047 --> 01:07:00.982
Nick Cooper
isn't who you think he is.

01:07:00.984 --> 01:07:03.684
- I'm saving you.
- Court's right, Rosie.

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:06.020
We're just trying to
help you find yourself.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:07.688
We all really want you
to be one of us.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.525
We want you to be a ZB.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.193
You know who I think is mad hot

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:15.496
and would be all about
treating you like a Princess?

01:07:15.498 --> 01:07:16.764
Who?

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.099
Billy.

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:20.468
He's a total prince charming,

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:24.539
and I've heard
he's got a great cock.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:26.541
Nick's roommate, Billy?

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:29.877
If you really want Nick,
Billy's the way to go.

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.546
You get naked in his room,

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.047
because you're slaying
his roommate.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:35.716
It'll drive him crazy,
"Jessie's girl" -style.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:38.953
Is Nick really that good?

01:07:38.955 --> 01:07:41.656
Yes! Nick Cooper's
got skills for days.

01:07:41.658 --> 01:07:44.659
Now let's come up with a plan
to get you in that room.

01:07:44.661 --> 01:07:46.494
All right.

01:07:47.596 --> 01:07:48.763
Check this out.

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:51.833
- Yo, Chad. Catch.

01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:53.701
You're scared?
Didn't want to catch it?

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:55.870
No. I'm just,
I'm just wasted.

01:07:55.872 --> 01:07:58.005
I really respect you.

01:07:58.007 --> 01:08:00.975
- Whoa.

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:05.780
Whoa. Anybody
fucked her yet?

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:08.649
I hope not. Apparently she
doesn't shave down there.

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:11.018
Ugh! Disgusting.
That is punishable by death.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.753
That shit was hot in the '90s.

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.255
I'm sure you wouldn't have
had a problem with that

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.057
- three months ago.
- What?

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:18.693
I'm just saying, you've come
a long way remarkably fast.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.761
- Whatever, dude.
- What's up, guys?

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.263
- What's up?
- Hey Billy, do a line.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:26.033
No, no, I'm good.
You okay, man?

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:27.734
You went and calmed down
a little bit, huh?

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:29.937
- I didn't ask you, faggot.
- Whoa, fag...

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.939
I don't that's quite
the right terminology, is it?

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.942
Megan, right?
Nice to meet you.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.944
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
She's mine, bro, okay?

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.779
- I'm just playing, man.
- I found her first.

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:40.948
You gotta go find your own.
You know what you should do?

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.818
Your family is in the slave
business, right? Down south?

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.720
Why don't you go back
to that, be the slave,

01:08:46.723 --> 01:08:49.689
- and fetch me a Whisky.
- I'll fetch you a drink, okay?

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:51.058
I just want you to calm down

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.527
and try to remember
where you came from,

01:08:52.529 --> 01:08:53.861
- all right?
- No, I know.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:56.631
I know where I came from.

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.866
Do you know where you came from?

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.935
- Billy.
- It's okay.

01:09:00.937 --> 01:09:04.238
Billy, fucking roommate,
this is a nice cardigan.

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.241
You always dress so nice, Billy.

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:09.243
We're roommates,

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:12.113
and we made a good team, Billy.

01:09:12.115 --> 01:09:14.814
Really good team, Roomie.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.783
You know what, uh,

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:18.219
you should do?

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.956
You should go help your
family make some money

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:24.091
for the first time in
maybe 100 years.

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:30.197
Maybe you'll have enough
money to buy more cardigans

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:33.568
and keep up this nice trim look

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.636
you got going on,
'cause you rock it.

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:37.138
You really, you really do.

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:40.041
It... it looks good.
You do it so well.

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:41.742
You do.

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:47.048
Now.

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:48.749
Wow.

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:50.618
You're a douche.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.752
You're a douche.

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:54.154
You're a douche.

01:09:55.657 --> 01:09:58.993
Billy, Billy. Wait.
What was that?

01:10:00.228 --> 01:10:02.763
That, my dear,
might have been the end

01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:06.100
of a beautiful,
beautiful friendship,

01:10:06.102 --> 01:10:08.603
but...

01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:11.772
It was the beginning
of a pretty fantastic evening.

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.611
Now let's get the fuck
out of here!

01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:18.613
- Ah!
- Come on! Come on!

01:10:18.615 --> 01:10:22.116
Nick.
I am impressed.

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:25.853
Anyway, people,

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:27.188
there's still a party happening.

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:28.889
- Megan!
- -Yeah.

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:30.291
I fucking love that name.

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:31.826
- You say your name.
- Megan.

01:10:31.828 --> 01:10:33.160
- Megan.
- It's Megan.

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:34.328
- Megan.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:35.863
- Somebody's here!
- What?

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:38.199
- Someone's at the door.
- Oh, go away!

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:40.735
I'm getting to know Megan!

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.372
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:45.906
- Oh!
- Yeah!

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.808
- Oh, Billy.

01:10:50.145 --> 01:10:52.847
Hi. What're you doing here?

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:55.216
Megan, I'm gonna
need you to leave.

01:10:55.218 --> 01:10:57.118
- No, no, no, no, Megan.
- Goodbye, Billy.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.086
No, no, Megan. Megan,
don't, don't leave, Megan.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:01.288
- Darling.
- No. Why is she going?

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:02.823
Where is she going?

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:04.825
Billy.

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:07.828
I think you're gonna want to
listen to what I have to say.

01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:12.166
Is this what I think it is?

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:17.171
Chad, you've been pretty quiet.

01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:19.340
Which of these ladies
have you had your eye on?

01:11:19.342 --> 01:11:22.243
Fucking all of them.

01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:24.211
Gigi, right? Why don't
you do a little dance

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:25.680
for, uh, Chad,

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:28.349
who's apparently
had his eye on you.

01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:31.185
- All right.
- Uh oh.

01:11:31.187 --> 01:11:35.389
Oh, oh, shit.

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:37.892
Mr. palm beach.

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:39.226
Relax.

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:51.872
Can I help you?

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:53.207
I was just leaving.

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:55.209
What the hell you doing here?

01:11:55.211 --> 01:11:57.078
I was with Billy.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.779
What the fuck
you doing with Billy?

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.848
I don't need
to explain myself to you.

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:03.017
You're a fucking slut.

01:12:03.019 --> 01:12:05.019
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, that's what you are.

01:12:05.021 --> 01:12:06.887
I'm just calling it
like I see it.

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:08.923
I'm sorry, Nick,
have you looked in

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:10.291
- the mirror recently?
- What does that mean?

01:12:10.293 --> 01:12:11.992
God, I'm actually embarrassed

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.994
- I ever liked you.
- You didn't fucking like me.

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.396
You didn't give me time of day.

01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:17.264
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick,
that I didn't give you

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:18.933
what you wanted
when you wanted it,

01:12:18.935 --> 01:12:20.267
but by the time I turned around

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:22.236
I didn't even
recognize you anymore.

01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:25.005
You're disgusting.

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.994
Fuck you.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:57.772
Welcome to hell week,
spermchuggers.

01:12:57.774 --> 01:12:59.440
Happy Chinese new year, Chong.

01:12:59.442 --> 01:13:01.142
Goddamn, would you eat a horse?

01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:03.811
You look like a fucking
Asian Ally Mcbeal.

01:13:03.813 --> 01:13:05.980
Now, the first rule of hell week

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:07.481
is no pledges
are allowed to leave the house

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.183
unless you're fucking a chick.

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:10.985
The only way you get back in

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:13.788
is if your fingers smell
like a stench trench.

01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:17.124
Our first event
is pledge Olympics.

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:19.994
We got a couple circles
of hell for you.

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:21.862
Yeah?
You excited?

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:24.465
The first circle
is mystery shots.

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:26.000
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:27.501
Take that shot.

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.069
Oh, oh!

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.404
Nick, go again!
Go again!

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:33.073
And if you fail to reach
the final circle,

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:36.210
I'm gonna make sure
that you toss Benjamin's salad.

01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:39.213
- Go! Go! Go, bitches
- drink that bitches!

01:13:39.215 --> 01:13:40.548
And the guy hasn't
changed his underwear

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.082
or showered in three weeks.

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.584
He's training
for a fucking marathon!

01:13:48.824 --> 01:13:50.825
And I will
personally hold your nose

01:13:50.827 --> 01:13:52.359
right to his gooch.

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:00.301
- You're not a freak!

01:14:02.103 --> 01:14:04.371
Keep in mind, after hell week,

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:07.174
we're only a couple of
days away from initiation.

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.843
The end is in sight.

01:14:08.845 --> 01:14:10.945
Give him more.

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:12.279
Let's go, Cooper.
Come on.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:14.315
Let's hear you bawk
like a chicken.

01:14:18.186 --> 01:14:20.888
And you're that much closer
to joining us in brotherhood.

01:14:25.228 --> 01:14:27.528
So let's make this count.

01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:29.597
Some more fun for you.

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:34.201
Give it to him.

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:39.607
Ugh! Ugh!

01:14:39.609 --> 01:14:41.475
Ugh!

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.179
What the fuck is that?

01:14:46.515 --> 01:14:48.215
Let me squeeze a little more.

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:49.950
Ugh!

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:51.952
Fuck you doing, man!

01:14:51.954 --> 01:14:55.189
Be careful
who you fuck with, plebe.

01:15:15.176 --> 01:15:16.577
Benjamin.

01:15:16.579 --> 01:15:18.979
Bow to the elders!

01:15:20.081 --> 01:15:22.416
Welcome my children.

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:24.952
I am St. Peter.

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:27.955
Standing at the gates
of paradise,

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:29.957
here to tell you whether or not

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:32.660
your name is written
in the book of life.

01:15:32.662 --> 01:15:36.664
Today you will discover
if your lives forever

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:40.200
will be linked to the
Phidelt brotherhood.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:44.204
Today, you will discover

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:47.708
if you are one of us.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:51.312
Billy Hawkins, arise.

01:15:53.381 --> 01:15:58.252
The great-great-great-grandson
of Jefferson Davis.

01:15:58.254 --> 01:16:01.255
Pureblood.

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:05.225
Your name is written
in the book of life.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:07.328
Light your candle.

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:15.235
Zachary Rockefeller, arise.

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:19.406
Your name has always been
written in the book of life.

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:22.643
Light your candle.

01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:26.013
Jake Roudabega, arise.

01:16:26.015 --> 01:16:30.184
It must be assuring to you
to know your name is written

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:31.652
in the book of life.

01:16:31.654 --> 01:16:34.989
Jamarcus Desean Johnson,

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:38.192
the name "token"

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:41.195
is written in the book of life,

01:16:41.197 --> 01:16:44.331
and may we ride your
swift legs to victory.

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:47.401
Chad, arise.

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:53.007
How do you not know you are gay?

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:57.311
Everyone here can tell.
Like, everybody.

01:16:57.313 --> 01:17:00.114
Did you not think
we would notice?

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.682
- What?
- And that's okay,

01:17:01.684 --> 01:17:05.452
but know thyself, Chad.

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:09.056
Know thyself.

01:17:09.058 --> 01:17:11.425
Until you know yourself,

01:17:11.427 --> 01:17:14.261
you cannot be a Phidelt.

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:16.130
I can't tell
if you're joking or not.

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:18.432
- Exit!
- Mr. president, please.

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:22.036
- You are dismissed.
- I...

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:29.476
Ching Chang Chong, arise.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:33.414
Your name is written
in the book of life,

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:35.749
in over 20 languages.

01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:40.287
JT Hartung, arise.

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:44.224
Your name is written
in the book of life.

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:47.394
And lastly,

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:50.431
Nicholas Cooper, arise.

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:55.636
Nick.
I like you.

01:17:55.638 --> 01:17:57.438
I've always liked you.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.207
You try hard.

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:02.643
Try to impress.

01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:05.646
You're a monster, Nick.

01:18:05.648 --> 01:18:07.448
In fact, I don't even recognize

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:11.085
the thing that stands before me.

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:12.586
Cruel.

01:18:12.588 --> 01:18:17.391
Heartless.
I like it.

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:19.259
The problem is

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:23.597
we don't try hard.

01:18:23.599 --> 01:18:27.301
We don't try to impress.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:32.673
And we don't
lie about who we are.

01:18:32.675 --> 01:18:36.276
Mr. Cooper.

01:18:36.278 --> 01:18:38.212
I believe Billy

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:40.581
is the one that vouched for you.

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:42.583
Billy Hawkins,

01:18:42.585 --> 01:18:45.652
step forward
and defend yourself.

01:18:49.691 --> 01:18:54.695
Why did you lie
on behalf of Mr. Cooper?

01:18:54.697 --> 01:18:57.831
- I felt sorry for him.

01:18:57.833 --> 01:19:01.668
Billy lied once or twice,
but you, Nick,

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.437
you really fooled us.

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:06.306
Luckily, Benjamin
misses nothing.

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:07.641
And why would we need you,

01:19:07.643 --> 01:19:09.610
you poor piece of shit?

01:19:09.612 --> 01:19:13.313
Billy was wrong.

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:15.649
He made a fool of himself.

01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:18.619
He tried to make a
fool out of us.

01:19:18.621 --> 01:19:21.555
Now tell your roommate
that he won't be your brother.

01:19:21.557 --> 01:19:24.258
Sorry, Nick.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:27.594
You're not gonna be a Phidelt.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:31.532
And why won't he be a Phidelt?

01:19:31.534 --> 01:19:34.868
Because you're not one of us.

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:38.805
You're not one of us.

01:19:38.807 --> 01:19:41.208
And you are dismissed.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.876
Billy.

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:46.440
Hey, honey.

01:20:46.442 --> 01:20:48.275
Phidelt rejected me, mom.

01:20:48.277 --> 01:20:50.777
Dad's gonna be so disappointed.

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:52.746
It's not the end of the world.

01:20:52.748 --> 01:20:55.882
I think you're gonna need to come
home and tell your father...

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:58.285
In person.

01:21:00.989 --> 01:21:03.390
We love you.

01:21:04.692 --> 01:21:06.426
Bye.

01:21:32.687 --> 01:21:35.689
I gotta tell you, kid,
I am so proud of you.

01:21:35.691 --> 01:21:37.491
You did it!
You joined!

01:21:37.493 --> 01:21:38.825
- Thanks, dad.
- You know.

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:41.361
When I met that Billy
guy, I thought,

01:21:41.363 --> 01:21:43.697
"that's who I want
for a son."

01:21:43.699 --> 01:21:45.332
And you are
even better than Billy.

01:21:45.334 --> 01:21:47.034
That means a lot.
Really.

01:21:47.036 --> 01:21:49.036
Cheers.
I wish I had a PJ cocktail

01:21:49.038 --> 01:21:50.904
- to cheers you with.
- Hey, hey.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:52.773
Maybe we can get five.

01:21:52.775 --> 01:21:54.308
You know, a PJ cocktail...

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:57.477
You can have one
or two or three...

01:22:03.885 --> 01:22:06.553
What'd you think
was gonna happen?

01:22:06.555 --> 01:22:08.822
I'd let you tell him
you didn't get in?

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:13.627
It'd fucking kill him.

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:15.796
Go away.

01:22:15.798 --> 01:22:18.632
I've got work to do, Nicholas.
