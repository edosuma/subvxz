even know we were out here?

04:21.583 --> 04:24.333
-Terry texted me.
-NATHAN: What the fuck?

04:24.333 --> 04:26.458
It's her car, and you weren't
answering the phone,

04:26.458 --> 04:28.166
so I just...

04:28.166 --> 04:29.583

Keep a lookout, babe.

06:54.291 --> 06:56.000
Come on.

06:57.958 --> 07:00.125
Aah.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.750
Oi, oi, she's going to behave,
right?

07:01.750 --> 07:03.083
She ain't going to
fuck off in our wheels?

07:03.083 --> 07:04.958
Yeah, she's not going
anywhere, man.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.875
-Sweet, that.
-Yeah.

07:08.958 --> 07:10.625
TERRY: Wait up.

07:10.625 --> 07:12.375
-NATHAN: Fucking Terry.
-GAZ: Spaz.

07:18.375 --> 07:20.125
-Gaz.
-Mate.

07:27.666 --> 07:33.416
What did you do that for?

07:33.416 --> 07:34.916
Look, we said there was
going to be no --

07:34.916 --> 07:36.166
Shut up, Terry.

07:36.166 --> 07:38.375
Open fucking sesame.

07:39.541 --> 07:41.500
After you, mate.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.208
Yeah.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.666
Hmm, very nice.

07:50.666 --> 07:52.541
So where is it?

07:52.541 --> 07:54.458
Terry, where's the safe?

07:54.458 --> 07:56.833
-I don't know.
-What?

07:56.833 --> 07:58.791
Alright, sweet tooth.

07:58.791 --> 08:00.416
So we're in the park,

08:00.416 --> 08:03.208
and big man Terry
tells us a story.

08:03.208 --> 08:05.333
Tells us there's a nice
big, old house

08:05.333 --> 08:08.333
and the nice old owners
are going to be out, right?

08:08.333 --> 08:10.458
-Right.
-Tells us there's a safe

08:10.458 --> 08:13.125
with a nice, fat stash of cash
just sitting in it,

08:13.125 --> 08:16.041
and now he tells us he don't
know where the fuck it is?

08:16.041 --> 08:17.666
Well, it could be
in -- in the bedroom

08:17.666 --> 08:19.000
or -- or the doctor's room.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.500
Oh, yeah, or the fucking
broom cupboard.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.708
What's all this, your mom's?

08:22.708 --> 08:25.791
Should tell her a good skivvy
takes better care of her kid.

08:25.791 --> 08:27.833
That's it, Mrs. Mop.

08:41.541 --> 08:43.208
He needs to show some respect.

08:43.208 --> 08:45.375
We can't just wreck --
We said that we wouldn't --

08:45.375 --> 08:48.708
Terry, it is what they
pay you monthly, no?

08:48.708 --> 08:50.041
Well, look at it. It's --

08:50.041 --> 08:51.208
-What's happened to your ear?
-What?

08:51.208 --> 08:53.000
Other ear, Terry, the gay one.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.083
Oh, fuck. I must have lost it.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.250
Oi.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.416
For fuck's sake, mate.

09:04.416 --> 09:06.166
What the --

09:17.416 --> 09:19.625
NATHAN: Shit.

09:19.625 --> 09:22.958
I really fucking hated
this place.

09:22.958 --> 09:26.625
Oi.

09:26.625 --> 09:28.291
She's let herself go, eh?

09:28.291 --> 09:30.416
Yeah, well, I'd like to see you
deal with being ill.

09:32.250 --> 09:35.625
NATHAN: Terry, get your ass
in here, mate.

09:35.625 --> 09:39.916
Ah.

09:39.916 --> 09:41.375
What?

09:41.375 --> 09:42.875
What's down there?

09:42.875 --> 09:44.625
I don't know. What?

09:44.625 --> 09:45.958
Should we have a look?

09:45.958 --> 09:48.916
-A bit of exercise.
-I-I can't. My ankle is --

09:48.916 --> 09:51.000
Alright, it's not going
to fucking fall off. Relax.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.958
-What's he doing up there?

09:53.958 --> 09:55.250
I don't know.
But it doesn't matter.

09:55.250 --> 09:56.375
It's not your fucking house,
Terry.

09:56.375 --> 09:58.208
Do whatever you like.

09:58.208 --> 09:59.500
Move on.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.291
Get down there.

10:19.958 --> 10:22.250
TERRY: Why do I always
get the shit jobs?

10:49.875 --> 10:51.833
Here goes the neighborhood.

11:12.958 --> 11:14.958
Nathan.

11:14.958 --> 11:16.916
Nathan, I found it.

11:21.083 --> 11:24.291
MARY: Come on,
what are you doing?

11:24.291 --> 11:29.041
NATHAN: Oh, can you imagine
how much they've got stashed?

11:29.041 --> 11:30.708
It's there!

11:30.708 --> 11:35.041
Oh, you are going to be able
to buy your own kebab van, mate.

11:35.041 --> 11:36.750
The Huggins are fucking loaded.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.458
-Can you imagine?
-Okeydokey.

11:38.458 --> 11:41.500
What the fuck?

11:41.500 --> 11:43.208
What?

11:45.208 --> 11:46.833
You said it was
an electronic code.

11:46.833 --> 11:48.166
TERRY: Yeah.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.791
Uh, yeah, uh,
that's what my mom said.

11:49.791 --> 11:51.625
-So?
-Really?

11:51.625 --> 11:55.375
Did she tell you what the fuck
I'm supposed to do with this?

11:55.375 --> 11:57.416
What do you mean?

11:57.416 --> 11:58.750
It's a dial lock.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.541
Can you crack a combination?

12:00.541 --> 12:02.541
Of course not.

12:02.541 --> 12:04.833
That makes two of us.

12:04.833 --> 12:06.333
-You can't open it?
-Oh, yeah.

12:06.333 --> 12:09.791
-Top marks, fat boy.
-It can't be that hard.

12:09.791 --> 12:12.250
It's -- It's probably just
a birthday, something like that.

12:25.708 --> 12:28.125
-Piece of shit.

12:28.125 --> 12:29.625
It weren't a Christmas present.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.458
That guy that lent it to me
ain't Santa Claus.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.333
He don't fuck around
when it comes to debts, mate.

12:42.541 --> 12:45.166
I should have known any plan
I had with you in it

12:45.166 --> 12:47.250
was fucked from the start.

12:47.250 --> 12:50.708
It was your idea to come here,
you and him.

12:50.708 --> 12:51.833
-I never wanted --
-Move.

13:01.416 --> 13:04.333
Fuck!

13:12.041 --> 13:14.083
What?

13:14.083 --> 13:17.000
MARY: This is bullshit, Nathan.
I want to go now.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.708
Hold on.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.625
You're the boss.

13:22.625 --> 13:24.333
What's the plan, boss?

13:24.333 --> 13:25.583
TERRY: Look, we've already
been here too long.

13:25.583 --> 13:27.500
We should go.
Anyways, Mary's --

13:27.500 --> 13:30.083
Don't even think about telling
me what to do with my mis--

13:30.083 --> 13:31.333
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

13:31.333 --> 13:34.791
Let's keep it civil, ladies.

13:34.791 --> 13:36.625
Mate, you want the tosh, right?

13:36.625 --> 13:38.625
-Yeah.
-Really want it?

13:38.625 --> 13:40.000
Of course I fucking want it.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.541
And these two
withered old cunts

13:41.541 --> 13:44.125
are the ones with
the magic code, right?

13:44.125 --> 13:46.125
Why don't we screw it
out of them?

13:50.375 --> 13:53.291
Yeah, we wait
till they get back.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.208
We scare the shit out of them.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.708
They give us what we want.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.000
Right.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.833
They'll piss
the fucking code out.

14:03.833 --> 14:05.416
-Nice one, mate.

14:05.416 --> 14:08.083
Plenty of time for
the little lady later, right?

14:13.583 --> 14:16.291
MARY: Hello? Nathan?

14:16.291 --> 14:19.000
Hello?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.583
Wanker.

14:33.833 --> 14:36.041
Look, they're going to be
back any minute.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.333
Piece of shit.

14:38.333 --> 14:39.958
The TV doesn't work.

14:39.958 --> 14:41.708
It's for video.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.791
What the fuck is this?

14:56.208 --> 14:58.958
-Oh, bingo.
-Rich cunts.

14:58.958 --> 15:00.916
GAZ: Yeah, disgusting, ain't it?

15:00.916 --> 15:03.000
Fucking fake.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.708
I'm not joking, mate.

15:06.500 --> 15:10.666
How I've spent my whole life
with fuck all.

15:10.666 --> 15:14.458
Watched my dad rot away
with fuck all,

15:14.458 --> 15:16.541
never anything to give my mom.

15:18.625 --> 15:20.375
I know you're not
joking there, mate.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.166
I know.

15:22.166 --> 15:23.791
It's what we're doing.

15:23.791 --> 15:25.958
It's why we're here.
We're taking it back.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.458
It's yours, mate, all yours.

15:28.458 --> 15:31.750
Yeah.

15:31.750 --> 15:35.583
Fuck it, yeah.

15:35.583 --> 15:37.125
Now, don't just stand there,
Benson.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.208
Get us something to eat.

15:39.208 --> 15:40.458
Quality snacks, yeah?

15:40.458 --> 15:42.666
Chip sticks, salami, nuts.

15:44.416 --> 15:46.666
Cunt.

15:46.666 --> 15:49.041
MARY: Nathan!

15:49.041 --> 15:53.791
Nathan!

15:55.916 --> 15:57.791
Nathan!

15:57.791 --> 16:01.000
-MARY: Nathan!

16:01.000 --> 16:03.750
Might need to sort that, mate.
She's getting a bit mouthy.

16:06.291 --> 16:08.333
She's just worried
about her job.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.958
I could drive her and then
bring the car back.

16:09.958 --> 16:11.833
Drive her?

16:11.833 --> 16:15.125
He wants to have a go, eh?
Hey, you dirty pig.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.375
You want to get stuck right in,
pump some of that lard out?

16:17.375 --> 16:19.333
NATHAN: She is going
absolutely nowhere.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.375
We all stay right here
till this is finished.

16:21.375 --> 16:23.166
Too fucking right, mate.

16:23.166 --> 16:24.250
She's not just
going to let us --

16:24.250 --> 16:26.500
-Let us?
-MARY: Nathan!

16:26.500 --> 16:28.500
Terry, she'll do whatever
the fuck I want.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.000
MARY: Nathan!

16:30.000 --> 16:33.208
Nathan!

16:33.208 --> 16:35.166
NATHAN: She's not her sister.

16:35.166 --> 16:36.583
MARY: Nathan!

16:36.583 --> 16:38.791
Nathan!

16:41.166 --> 16:43.791
Babe!

16:43.791 --> 16:45.166
MARY: Can we please go now?

16:45.166 --> 16:46.958
Oh, come in.
You've got to see this.

16:46.958 --> 16:49.708
I have to be at work, Nathan.

16:49.708 --> 16:50.750
Won't take long.

16:50.750 --> 16:53.708
Stop messing with me.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.166
Five minutes,
then we're out of here,

16:55.166 --> 16:56.333
but you've got to see this.

16:56.333 --> 16:58.333
You'll love it.
I promise.

16:58.333 --> 17:01.208
-Come over.
-Five minutes.

17:01.208 --> 17:04.416
Come over.

17:04.416 --> 17:06.125
Come on.

17:23.791 --> 17:26.625
What are you waiting for, babe?
Come on in.

17:34.541 --> 17:37.625
Well, what am I looking at?

17:37.625 --> 17:40.291
NATHAN: Come here, babe.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.541
Nathan, stop.

17:42.541 --> 17:46.000
It's not fucking half bad,
is it?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.916
Nathan, stop.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.958
Yeah.

17:50.958 --> 17:52.583
You won't be needing that shit
for much longer.

17:52.583 --> 17:55.208
We're almost there, babe.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.083
Nathan.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.416
Stop it.

18:00.416 --> 18:02.583
Terry's watching.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.875
NATHAN: Let him.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.416
Come on, perv, work to do.

18:07.416 --> 18:09.958
These lovebirds have got
some sorting out to do.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.666
Have fun, sweethearts.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.250
Fuck's sake.

18:36.375 --> 18:37.750
Oh, yeah.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.166
This the mop?

18:39.166 --> 18:40.833
Forget that slag downstairs.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.958
This one is more your style.
You'd make a lovely couple.

18:43.958 --> 18:46.166
That's Kate.
She was the Huggins' daughter.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.916
She died a long time ago.

18:48.916 --> 18:51.000
Mop.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.708
Definitely here.

18:56.416 --> 18:59.125
No, fuck off, Nathan.

18:59.125 --> 19:00.375
What's wrong?

19:00.375 --> 19:03.666
Is this 'cause of last night?

19:03.666 --> 19:06.000
Hmm?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.708
I'm pregnant.

19:11.125 --> 19:13.875
Pregnant.

19:13.875 --> 19:16.291
Know what that means?

19:16.291 --> 19:19.625
No worries, babe.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.791
We're going to be
fucking loaded.

19:24.291 --> 19:27.166
Plenty to go around, right?

19:27.166 --> 19:28.291
No.

19:28.291 --> 19:30.250
Yeah.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.625
Yeah, I just need
to finish this.

19:34.416 --> 19:36.375
That's right.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.958
Shit.

19:43.541 --> 19:44.875
What the fuck are you doing?

19:44.875 --> 19:46.458
No worries, babe.
Alright?

19:46.458 --> 19:49.500
I've got everything
under control.

19:49.500 --> 19:52.333
-TERRY: Wait.
-GAZ: Shut up, retard.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.833
Right. Put these on.

19:55.833 --> 19:57.375
No way.

19:57.375 --> 19:59.708
GAZ: Yes way, darling.

19:59.708 --> 20:01.375
NATHAN: Come on.

20:01.375 --> 20:05.041
Hey, come on.

20:05.041 --> 20:06.750
Put it on.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.375
Put the stocking on, Mary.

20:14.791 --> 20:16.458
GAZ: No names.

20:34.708 --> 20:36.333
Richard.

20:36.333 --> 20:38.208
GAZ: Go, go, go, go, go, go!

20:38.208 --> 20:41.000
Go, go, go, go, go!

20:43.416 --> 20:44.583
GAZ: Easy, easy. Alright.

20:44.583 --> 20:49.500
Ellen, Ellen, Ellen!

20:49.500 --> 20:53.250
GAZ: Give me your hands
or I'll break your arms.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.500
Move. Just move.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.500
Sit down.

21:03.541 --> 21:05.083
I'm right here, darling.

21:05.083 --> 21:06.708
-NATHAN: Give me your hands.
-RICHARD: Please.

21:06.708 --> 21:10.416
-Give me your hands.
-She's injured. Please.

21:10.416 --> 21:11.666
Please.

21:11.666 --> 21:13.416
Take everything you want,

21:13.416 --> 21:15.750
but you can't leave her
like this.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.416
I mean, look at her.

21:17.416 --> 21:20.791
She's -- She's injured.

21:20.791 --> 21:22.416
You'll find everything
out there.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.541
Quickly.

21:24.541 --> 21:26.041
GAZ: Granddad takes charge, eh?

21:26.041 --> 21:27.791
Exactly, you don't get to ask
for fuck all.

21:27.791 --> 21:30.125
-Alright?
-I'll sort it out.

21:30.125 --> 21:32.583
-What?
-Yes, you'll find disinfectant

21:32.583 --> 21:34.708
and the bandages are in
the cupboard at the back --

21:34.708 --> 21:38.125
Hey, she's not a fucking retard.
Alright? Shut it.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Fucking who do you
think you are?

21:49.333 --> 21:52.416
What...

21:52.416 --> 21:53.458
Ah.

22:01.833 --> 22:05.250
Here you go.
Drink this.

22:05.250 --> 22:08.416
That's it.

22:08.416 --> 22:10.125
RICHARD: Thank you.

22:10.125 --> 22:14.000
Now, please make sure there are
no splinters in the cut.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.083
MARY: That's it. Hold still.

22:22.791 --> 22:26.458
RICHARD: Good. Now some
disinfectant on the cut.

22:29.625 --> 22:31.333
-This will sting.
-Sting?

22:31.333 --> 22:32.916
Yes, darling.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.291
Like a bee?

22:34.291 --> 22:36.333
Yes, a bit like a bee.

22:36.333 --> 22:38.666
Oh, I like bees.

22:38.666 --> 22:40.750
We keep them in the garden.

22:44.750 --> 22:46.041
MARY: That's it.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.750
NATHAN: Can you hurry up?

22:54.750 --> 22:56.958
We're not spending
the fucking night.

23:09.541 --> 23:11.291
Now tie her up.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.833
NATHAN: Come on.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.250
Sorry.

23:27.333 --> 23:29.500
Alright. Fine. Done.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.333
Okay, so now
we've taken care of her.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.041
Give us what we came for.

23:34.041 --> 23:37.166
There are £300 and a credit card
in my wallet.

23:37.166 --> 23:39.291
Alright.

23:39.291 --> 23:41.083
What else?

23:41.083 --> 23:44.125
In the kitchen there's £1,000
or so in a biscuit tin

23:44.125 --> 23:45.791
-on top of the fridge.
-Alright.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.750
Go and get the money
and put it in a bag.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.833
What's the fucking PIN number?

23:50.833 --> 23:53.625
6193.

23:53.625 --> 23:55.625
NATHAN: 6193.

23:55.625 --> 23:58.833
Alright.

23:58.833 --> 24:01.875
93. Very good.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.416
Hey.

24:05.708 --> 24:07.791
It was locked. Alright?
We can get Gaz's mate --

24:07.791 --> 24:09.708
No fucking names, asshole.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.333
-Sorry, it's just --
-MARY: You've got it.

24:11.333 --> 24:13.041
Right, let's go.

24:16.166 --> 24:18.333
-Is that it?
-Less than 2 grand

24:18.333 --> 24:20.666
You're having a laugh.

24:20.666 --> 24:23.458
You taking a piss,
you horrible old fucker?

24:23.458 --> 24:25.458
Mate, I said, "Is that it?"
This is all you've got?

24:25.458 --> 24:28.041
A doctor, nice big house
like this?

24:28.041 --> 24:29.875
I think someone
is telling porkies.

24:29.875 --> 24:31.375
NATHAN: What about the safe?

24:31.375 --> 24:33.125
Huh?
What about the fucking safe, eh?

24:33.125 --> 24:34.666
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:34.666 --> 24:36.458
GAZ: He's talking about
the safe, you cunt.

24:36.458 --> 24:39.166
We don't have a safe.

24:39.166 --> 24:41.500
Are you sure?

24:41.500 --> 24:43.166
Of course I'm sure.

24:43.166 --> 24:45.250
There is no safe.

24:45.250 --> 24:46.958
NATHAN: Really?

24:50.291 --> 24:52.666
So what about that nice,
big shiny metal door

24:52.666 --> 24:54.458
down in your basement?
What's that, then?

24:54.458 --> 24:56.041
Fucking doll's house?

24:56.041 --> 24:58.166
What are you talking about?

24:58.166 --> 25:01.041
More fucking money.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.750
A lot more.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.041
GAZ: Fuck's sake.

25:11.041 --> 25:14.291
MAN:

25:14.291 --> 25:17.958
RICHARD: You'll regret this.

25:17.958 --> 25:20.666
GAZ: Shut up, you old cunt.

25:24.750 --> 25:25.958
I'm going to get out of here,
Nathan.

25:25.958 --> 25:28.041
-This is fucked.
-I know.

25:28.041 --> 25:31.666
Listen, there is a ton of cash
in that safe.

25:31.666 --> 25:33.625
Okay? You can forget about
working at the home.

25:33.625 --> 25:35.625
Life is going to be changing.

25:35.625 --> 25:37.000
Are you listening to me?

25:37.000 --> 25:41.208
I'm doing this for you, me,
the baby.

25:41.208 --> 25:43.083
This is bullshit, okay?

25:43.083 --> 25:44.916
It's totally fucked.

25:44.916 --> 25:49.500
GAZ: Shit, better than
"EastEnders," this.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.916
Let's do this.

25:50.916 --> 25:52.416
Yeah, business first, yeah?

25:52.416 --> 25:54.166
Sort domestics later.

25:59.250 --> 26:00.666
Give me the combination.

26:00.666 --> 26:02.166
Richard, no.

26:02.166 --> 26:05.375
This won't get you
anywhere but prison.

26:05.375 --> 26:09.208
Go home before things
really get out of hand,

26:09.208 --> 26:11.291
and we'll forget all about it.

26:11.291 --> 26:13.833
Give me the fucking
combination now.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.416
I can't.

26:15.416 --> 26:17.791
Who the fuck do you think
you're dealing with, here?

26:17.791 --> 26:19.208
Eh?

26:19.208 --> 26:21.750
From what I can see,
an ill-mannered lout

26:21.750 --> 26:25.458
on the verge of making
a catastrophic error.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.791
I think somebody didn't get
enough spankings

26:28.791 --> 26:29.958
when he was little.

26:29.958 --> 26:31.583
I'm tempted to agree, darling.

26:31.583 --> 26:33.625
-Ah!
-Oh!

26:33.625 --> 26:36.291
ELLEN: Don't hurt Richard,
my Richard.

26:36.291 --> 26:37.458
Shh, darling.

26:37.458 --> 26:41.833
Shh, do-do-do-don't upset
yourself.

26:41.833 --> 26:44.125
Everything will be fine.

26:44.125 --> 26:46.458
Don't worry, Mrs. Robinson.

26:46.458 --> 26:47.958
We're not animals.

26:47.958 --> 26:49.666
No one is going to hurt
your precious hubby.

26:49.666 --> 26:52.333
Your darling Richard
is safe with us.

26:52.333 --> 26:54.166
To be honest,

26:54.166 --> 26:55.916
it's you I'm more worried about.

26:55.916 --> 26:57.541
My wife doesn't know
the combination.

26:57.541 --> 26:58.958
GAZ: Of course she doesn't,
Richard.

26:58.958 --> 27:00.416
Of course she doesn't.

27:00.416 --> 27:02.125
But I'm asking you.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.666
Leave her alone.
Don't hurt her.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.333
Nathan, fucking stop him.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.000
Hey.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.333
The fuck are you doing?

27:10.333 --> 27:11.750
You can't just...

27:11.750 --> 27:13.541
Alright, mate.

27:13.541 --> 27:15.250
You're the boss.

27:30.791 --> 27:32.500
There we go, mate.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.166
What the fuck am I
supposed to do with that?

27:41.166 --> 27:43.875
You want him to give us
the combination, right?

27:49.875 --> 27:52.791
This is fucking bullshit.

27:52.791 --> 27:54.416
Where are you going?

27:54.416 --> 27:56.541
Hey, hey, come back.

27:56.541 --> 27:57.791
Nice one, mate.

27:57.791 --> 28:00.083
Don't worry, mate.
Daddy's on it.

28:01.833 --> 28:03.500
Mary.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.750
You hiding from Gaz?

28:05.750 --> 28:09.583
Mary, Mary.

28:09.583 --> 28:12.291
Mary, Mary.

28:12.291 --> 28:16.208
Mary.

28:16.208 --> 28:19.333
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.

28:19.333 --> 28:21.125
Ahh.

28:28.125 --> 28:29.916
A-ha.

28:31.208 --> 28:34.083
Where are you, darling?
You hiding from Gaz?

28:58.916 --> 29:01.083
WOMAN: Emergency services?

29:01.083 --> 29:02.083
-Help.

29:04.166 --> 29:06.541
GAZ: Got you!

29:06.541 --> 29:10.333
-MARY: Leave me alone!

29:10.333 --> 29:13.000
What the fuck?
Nathan, help me!

29:13.000 --> 29:16.250
Don't let him manipulate you.

29:16.250 --> 29:19.541
It's not too late.

29:19.541 --> 29:21.208
You're young.

29:21.208 --> 29:24.791
Don't destroy your futures
for the sake of some thug.

29:24.791 --> 29:27.875
-Listen.

29:27.875 --> 29:30.541
He's an animal.

29:30.541 --> 29:32.083
What's he doing to her?

29:32.083 --> 29:34.000
I think he's doing bad things.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.625
Yes, dear, very bad things.

29:36.625 --> 29:38.958
Hey, shut up. Alright?

29:38.958 --> 29:40.625
Just shut up.

29:40.625 --> 29:44.166
How did you get mixed up
in something like this, Terry?

29:44.166 --> 29:47.833
It's not like you,
all this violence.

29:47.833 --> 29:51.958
Your poor mom, she'll be
so upset, so disappointed.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.125
Terry?

29:53.125 --> 29:55.916
You two were always inseparable.

29:55.916 --> 29:58.916
I can't believe that's changed.

29:58.916 --> 30:02.458
It hasn't changed,
has it, Nathan?

30:05.166 --> 30:08.791
Nathan?

30:08.791 --> 30:11.166
Lover boy not up to keeping you
in line, eh?

30:11.166 --> 30:12.750
You worried about your Nathan
getting mixed up

30:12.750 --> 30:16.666
-in all this shit?
-Fuck off.

30:16.666 --> 30:18.250
He's a big boy, princess.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.000
He don't need no one
to make his decision for him.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.333
Especially
not some fucking psycho.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.333
What, you going to trap him
with a kid

30:25.333 --> 30:26.958
and a quick tumble
every Saturday night?

30:26.958 --> 30:29.458
He's so over you, darling,
it ain't even funny.

30:29.458 --> 30:33.166
We're going to crack that safe
wide-open, nick all their money,

30:33.166 --> 30:35.250
then Nathan is going to leave
you and your shit little brat

30:35.250 --> 30:37.833
to your shit little life
in this shit fucking shithole.

30:37.833 --> 30:39.708
-Nathan!
-No!

30:39.708 --> 30:43.041
Let's keep it down, eh?

30:43.041 --> 30:46.041
RICHARD: I watched you grow up.

30:46.041 --> 30:48.666
I knew your families.

30:48.666 --> 30:50.916
I know what hardships
you've been through.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.791
Things haven't been easy,

30:53.791 --> 30:57.333
but you're good lads,
strong lads,

30:57.333 --> 31:00.041
and you hung in there.

31:00.041 --> 31:01.500
I know what made you.

31:01.500 --> 31:05.875
I know what you're made of,
what you are.

31:05.875 --> 31:07.375
You're not responsible for this.

31:07.375 --> 31:10.333
I can see that clear as day.

31:10.333 --> 31:15.000
It's the other one,
that beast up there.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.625
He's not from here, is he?

31:18.625 --> 31:20.541
A stranger.

31:20.541 --> 31:23.458
Don't let him ruin everything,

31:23.458 --> 31:25.333
your friendship,

31:25.333 --> 31:28.208
your life.

31:28.208 --> 31:31.083
You're worth so much more.

31:31.083 --> 31:32.166
Trust me.

31:32.166 --> 31:33.666
Hey. Shut up.

31:33.666 --> 31:35.208
You're only saying this
because you want to keep

31:35.208 --> 31:36.791
all of your fucking money,
don't you?

31:36.791 --> 31:39.000
He's right, Nathan.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.916
We should just stop it.

31:40.916 --> 31:42.916
Afterwards, it'll be too late.

31:42.916 --> 31:44.500
It just doesn't feel right!

31:44.500 --> 31:49.375
Shut your mouth, or I will
cut your fucking tongue out.

31:49.375 --> 31:54.083
We stick to the plan.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.416
What were you doing up there?

31:55.416 --> 31:56.916
Little miss bitch here
was making a call,

31:56.916 --> 31:58.708
couldn't wait to fuck you over.

32:03.958 --> 32:06.208
-It can't be, Richard.
-Shh.

32:06.208 --> 32:07.791
Shifting up a gear, eh?

32:07.791 --> 32:10.250
About fucking time, people!

32:13.000 --> 32:16.958
-NATHAN: Right.
-Nathan, don't do this.

32:16.958 --> 32:18.666
No more fucking about.

32:22.666 --> 32:24.416
The code.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.500
GAZ: Hey.

32:34.208 --> 32:35.583
What?

32:40.500 --> 32:43.041
Give me the code,

32:43.041 --> 32:46.041
or I cut her finger off.

32:46.041 --> 32:48.166
-The code.
-Don't! Nathan!

32:48.166 --> 32:49.708
Shut it, window licker.
The man's working.

32:49.708 --> 32:52.916
Give me the fucking code,
Richard!

32:52.916 --> 32:54.666
Don't do it.

32:54.666 --> 32:58.291
Think of Mary, the baby.

33:04.708 --> 33:06.250
NATHAN: What the fuck?

33:06.250 --> 33:07.833
GAZ: Don't worry about
my little friend, mate.

33:07.833 --> 33:10.250
You just show these cunts here
what you're made of.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.625
Last chance.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.125
Give it a little twist
when you hit the bone.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.208
Whip it off of the knuckle,
nice and clean.

33:27.500 --> 33:31.291
Do it.

33:31.291 --> 33:33.791
Alright. If it's so easy, yeah,
you fucking do it!

33:33.791 --> 33:37.041
Good, Nathan.

33:37.041 --> 33:39.541
What the fuck?

33:39.541 --> 33:41.000
Oh.

33:41.000 --> 33:45.750
You're mates now,

33:45.750 --> 33:47.916
you and the doctor
and his good lady wife?

33:47.916 --> 33:49.708
-NATHAN: Don't.
-You've got responsibilities.

33:49.708 --> 33:52.541
-NATHAN: Stop it!
-You fucking lollipop.

33:52.541 --> 33:55.250
Who knew you were such
a delicate little bunny?

33:55.250 --> 33:56.958
What's wrong with him, Doc?

33:56.958 --> 33:59.083
Him and special needs
and that silly slag over there?

33:59.083 --> 34:01.083
Something in the water
around here?

34:01.083 --> 34:03.500
Couldn't do nothing for him.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.791
Should have been
put down at birth.

34:06.791 --> 34:08.833
Pitiful.

34:08.833 --> 34:10.583
Cut it off.

34:19.750 --> 34:20.916
-No.

34:20.916 --> 34:22.000
Do it.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.333
Please.

34:23.333 --> 34:28.333
Cut her fucking finger off,
wanker!

34:42.458 --> 34:46.625
Give me the code, please.

34:55.375 --> 34:57.291
Fuck.

35:03.083 --> 35:04.958
What you go and do that for?

35:10.833 --> 35:12.458
Nathan!

35:21.625 --> 35:23.666
MARY: Nathan.

35:48.083 --> 35:53.916
Ah!

35:53.916 --> 35:58.000
Ah, you silly cunt!

35:58.000 --> 36:00.791
Fuck!

36:00.791 --> 36:03.166
Nathan!

36:03.166 --> 36:04.500
GAZ: We could have had
a lot of fun.

36:04.500 --> 36:05.791
Nathan!
Oh, my God!

36:05.791 --> 36:07.166
He's going to bleed to death!

36:07.166 --> 36:09.041
We need to get him upstairs!
Untie me.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.041
Yeah.
I'd like to untie you, Doc.

36:11.041 --> 36:13.625
I'd like you to save lover boy
on the floor over there.

36:13.625 --> 36:15.083
I'd like to walk out of here

36:15.083 --> 36:17.208
leaving you and the missus
tucked up tight in bed

36:17.208 --> 36:18.791
ready for whatever it is
a pair of old skates

36:18.791 --> 36:20.333
like you get up to.

36:20.333 --> 36:22.833
No harm done,
everything forgiven.

36:22.833 --> 36:26.833
Believe me, I'd love that,
really, oi,

36:26.833 --> 36:30.333
drive out of this shithole back
to my penthouse in the big city,

36:30.333 --> 36:34.250
get my cock sucked right through
my asshole before beddy-byes,

36:34.250 --> 36:35.916
put me feet up,
get me head down,

36:35.916 --> 36:37.375
forget all about it over
a nice cup of tea

36:37.375 --> 36:40.375
and a bed full of £50s.

36:42.416 --> 36:46.041
Fucking mint, that'd be.

36:46.041 --> 36:47.208
Get my vote.

36:47.208 --> 36:49.625
But that ain't up to me.

36:49.625 --> 36:51.291
Oh, for fuck's sake, untie him!

36:51.291 --> 36:53.458
GAZ: Okay! Here's how
we're going to play it.

36:53.458 --> 36:54.791
You ready?

36:54.791 --> 36:56.291
You give me the magic numbers,

36:56.291 --> 36:57.750
I'll let you be doctors.

36:57.750 --> 36:59.416
Richard!

36:59.416 --> 37:01.000
MARY: Oh, give him
the fucking numbers.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.916
She's right, you know.
Give me the fucking numbers.

37:02.916 --> 37:04.666
ELLEN: You can't!

37:04.666 --> 37:06.583
Clock's ticking, mate.

37:10.666 --> 37:13.041
-Alright.
-ELLEN: Richard, no.

37:13.041 --> 37:16.166
Everything is going to be fine,
my darling.

37:16.166 --> 37:22.208
The numbers are 17, 1, 19, 22.

37:22.208 --> 37:23.375
There we go!

37:23.375 --> 37:24.750
How hard was it?

37:24.750 --> 37:26.375
Amazing what some greedy
bastards will do

37:26.375 --> 37:28.500
to keep their paws
on a few quid.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.500
GAZ: 17...

37:41.708 --> 37:43.666
-GAZ: ...1...

37:45.541 --> 37:50.541
GAZ: ...19, 22.

37:54.500 --> 38:00.875
Yes.
Um, it's 21, yes, not 22.

38:00.875 --> 38:02.291
21?

38:02.291 --> 38:04.125
Yes. 21.

38:04.125 --> 38:07.666
17, 1, 19, 21.

38:07.666 --> 38:13.083
17, 1, 19, 21?

38:13.083 --> 38:14.875
You sure?

38:14.875 --> 38:17.208
Don't want to change your mind,
confer with the missus?

38:17.208 --> 38:18.416
RICHARD: No. I'm sure.

38:18.416 --> 38:20.833
It was the year
that my Ellen was born.

38:22.833 --> 38:24.500
Okay.

38:28.333 --> 38:30.333
17...

38:35.541 --> 38:37.750
...1...

38:42.708 --> 38:45.000
...19...

38:48.541 --> 38:49.583
21.

38:57.458 --> 38:59.875
Oh, dear.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear,

39:04.000 --> 39:05.458
oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear.

39:05.458 --> 39:08.416
Wait a minute.
What -- What are you doing?

39:08.416 --> 39:09.833
No. No, please.

39:09.833 --> 39:11.166
Please, please, don't tie her.
I beg you.

39:11.166 --> 39:12.791
Don't tie her.

39:12.791 --> 39:14.625
-Too late, darling.
-RICHARD: Ellen, don't worry.

39:14.625 --> 39:16.916
Just don't -- don't worry.

39:16.916 --> 39:19.041
No, please!

39:19.041 --> 39:20.708
No, please!

39:20.708 --> 39:22.791
I beg of you.

39:22.791 --> 39:25.750
Ellen, don't worry.

39:25.750 --> 39:29.166
No, you can't! Please!

39:31.708 --> 39:33.625
Oh, no, please!

39:33.625 --> 39:35.333
Please, don't!

39:35.333 --> 39:38.916
No! Ellen!

39:38.916 --> 39:40.833
No! No, not my Ellen!

39:42.708 --> 39:45.000
No!

39:45.000 --> 39:46.416
No!

39:46.416 --> 39:48.125
Fuck's sake!

39:50.625 --> 39:53.083
Who did your electrics,
granddad?

39:53.083 --> 39:54.791
Fucking criminal.

39:58.833 --> 40:00.583
No.

40:00.583 --> 40:01.625
No.

40:01.625 --> 40:04.583
No!

40:04.583 --> 40:06.708
-Now...
-RICHARD: No!

40:06.708 --> 40:08.333
...where were we?

40:08.333 --> 40:10.583
-RICHARD: No!
-No!

40:32.833 --> 40:35.875
Mary, cut me loose, please.

40:41.041 --> 40:42.333
Oh.

40:42.333 --> 40:44.291
You did the right thing, Mary.

40:44.291 --> 40:46.083
You did what you had to do.

40:48.625 --> 40:50.166
MARY: We have to get him
to the hospital.

40:50.166 --> 40:53.333
Terry, help me.

40:53.333 --> 40:55.125
Terry, help me! Come on!

40:55.125 --> 40:58.625
Oh, no.

40:58.625 --> 41:00.583
No one's leaving.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.541
The hospital is 30 miles away.

41:04.541 --> 41:06.083
You know that.

41:06.083 --> 41:08.333
I seriously doubt he could
survive the journey.

41:08.333 --> 41:10.500
I'll treat him while
we wait for help.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.416
But look at him.

41:12.416 --> 41:14.125
Trust me.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.166
I'll take good care of him.

41:23.166 --> 41:24.833
Don't worry.

41:24.833 --> 41:28.166
Terry, I need you to help Mary
take Nathan upstairs.

41:28.166 --> 41:30.375
Can you manage that?

41:30.375 --> 41:32.083
Thank you, Terry.

42:01.583 --> 42:02.958
RICHARD: Come on, darling.

42:09.500 --> 42:10.541
Don't worry.

42:10.541 --> 42:12.416
We'll clean that up later.

42:16.541 --> 42:18.291
One second.

42:35.458 --> 42:38.625
That's it. Nearly there.

42:38.625 --> 42:39.750
Okay, lie back.

42:39.750 --> 42:41.625
-Watch it there.
-Get his legs.

42:41.625 --> 42:43.416
Get his legs.

42:47.708 --> 42:53.208
It's okay. It's okay.

42:53.208 --> 42:55.583
-No stitches.
-I'm sorry.

42:55.583 --> 42:57.416
RICHARD: No, darling,
not this time.

42:57.416 --> 42:59.125
Don't speak. Don't speak.

43:04.291 --> 43:05.916
ELLEN: Treats, Richard?

43:05.916 --> 43:06.958
Of course.

43:06.958 --> 43:11.791
Treats for my brave girl.

43:11.791 --> 43:13.916
Dr. Huggins, please!

43:16.375 --> 43:19.708
Until every sin is reckoned.

43:19.708 --> 43:21.541
You got what you deserve!

43:21.541 --> 43:23.958
-I hope you rot!
-Ellen!

43:23.958 --> 43:25.458
RICHARD: Come, come, dear.

43:25.458 --> 43:27.208
Please forgive my wife.

43:27.208 --> 43:30.333
She's not entirely herself
anymore, and don't worry.

43:30.333 --> 43:34.291
I fully intend
to keep my promise.

43:34.291 --> 43:36.208
Thank you, Dr. Huggins.

43:36.208 --> 43:39.916
Really, what did you expect me
to do, Terry, Mary?

43:50.333 --> 43:52.625
TERRY: It's alright.
He's just getting his things.

43:52.625 --> 43:54.291
It's alright.

43:57.250 --> 43:59.250
Right-o.

44:01.541 --> 44:03.583
No! No!

44:03.583 --> 44:05.875
MARY: Just breathe.

44:05.875 --> 44:08.041
-You're hurting him!
-Be quiet!

44:08.041 --> 44:10.791
MARY: It's okay.

44:10.791 --> 44:12.583
He's just taking it out.

44:12.583 --> 44:14.458
RICHARD: Compression.

44:14.458 --> 44:17.208
MARY: Oh! Oh, Jesus.

44:17.208 --> 44:18.625
Oh, God!

44:18.625 --> 44:20.083
It's okay. It's okay.

44:20.083 --> 44:21.625
RICHARD: The blade snapped off
inside.

44:21.625 --> 44:24.291
MARY: Just look at me.
Look at...

44:24.291 --> 44:25.875
You're hurting him!

44:25.875 --> 44:27.958
It's going to be okay.

44:34.083 --> 44:38.416
RICHARD: Compression.

44:38.416 --> 44:40.166
He's a lucky young man.

44:40.166 --> 44:42.666
The blade has missed
his vital organs.

44:42.666 --> 44:43.708
Yes.

44:43.708 --> 44:45.666
A little work,

44:45.666 --> 44:47.500
he'll make it.

44:47.500 --> 44:49.041
MARY: You hear that?

44:49.041 --> 44:50.833
You're going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

44:50.833 --> 44:52.875
RICHARD: Now, I want you all
to wait outside

44:52.875 --> 44:56.708
because I need space to work.

44:56.708 --> 44:57.875
-Don't -- Don't leave me.
-No, no.

44:57.875 --> 44:58.833
-It's okay.
-Don't leave me.

44:58.833 --> 45:00.333
I'm not going anywhere.

45:00.333 --> 45:02.541
-I'm staying.
-I must insist.

45:02.541 --> 45:04.541
I need peace and quiet

45:04.541 --> 45:06.541
if I'm going to look
after him properly.

45:06.541 --> 45:07.916
TERRY: We should go, yeah?

45:07.916 --> 45:09.666
Let Dr. Huggins
do his work, yeah?

45:09.666 --> 45:11.708
You're going to be okay.

45:11.708 --> 45:14.416
-NATHAN: Don't do it.
-Shh.

45:14.416 --> 45:16.000
TERRY: Come on, Mary.

45:20.416 --> 45:23.375
RICHARD: These are for Ellen,
and, please,

45:23.375 --> 45:29.458
watch over Mrs. Huggins
while I take care of Nathan.

45:29.458 --> 45:31.041
TERRY: Come on, Mrs. Huggins.

45:31.041 --> 45:32.416
-Come on.
-RICHARD: Now don't worry.

45:32.416 --> 45:34.875
I'll patch him up,
call the ambulance.

45:34.875 --> 45:36.583
Go away, then.

45:36.583 --> 45:38.291
Shoo, shoo.

45:41.083 --> 45:43.125
TERRY: Careful.
Watch the glass.

45:47.333 --> 45:49.958
Can I get you anything,
Mrs. Huggins?

46:15.291 --> 46:17.916
Mary, it's okay.
I'm here.

46:17.916 --> 46:21.958
He risked his wife's life
for a fucking security code.

46:23.958 --> 46:26.291
It's going to be okay.

46:26.291 --> 46:29.125
We just got to be strong, yeah?

47:02.041 --> 47:03.583
Come here.

47:03.583 --> 47:04.916
It's alright.

47:04.916 --> 47:07.250
Yeah, Mary? Shh.

47:07.250 --> 47:09.333
Please don't cry.

47:09.333 --> 47:10.916
Shh. It's going to be alright.

47:10.916 --> 47:12.083
You know Dr. Huggins.

47:12.083 --> 47:15.208
It's going to be okay, yeah?

47:15.208 --> 47:18.333
You're beautiful, yeah?

47:21.875 --> 47:23.875
What the fuck are you doing?

47:23.875 --> 47:24.916
Well, we're safe now.

47:24.916 --> 47:27.125
Safe?

47:27.125 --> 47:29.375
What the fuck are you
talking about?

47:29.375 --> 47:31.125
What do you think just happened
in the basement?

47:31.125 --> 47:33.041
Nathan is dying!

47:36.125 --> 47:37.583
How could you drag him
into this shit?

47:37.583 --> 47:39.666
It wasn't me.

47:39.666 --> 47:41.083
It was -- It was Nathan!

47:41.083 --> 47:43.041
And who gave him the idea?

47:43.041 --> 47:46.666
Whose fucking mom works here?

47:46.666 --> 47:48.750
You've always followed Nathan
around like a lost dog,

47:48.750 --> 47:49.916
but you could
never touch him.

47:49.916 --> 47:51.958
You're pathetic.

47:51.958 --> 47:54.291
We should go.

47:54.291 --> 47:56.041
I'm supposed to be
looking after Dr. Huggins --

47:56.041 --> 47:58.750
You'd have just let him die
if I hadn't done what I did.

47:58.750 --> 47:59.875
Don't say that!

47:59.875 --> 48:01.416
It's the truth.

48:01.416 --> 48:03.041
It's what you do, Terry.

48:03.041 --> 48:06.083
You fuck up, and everything
around you turns to shit!

48:06.083 --> 48:07.500
Why else do you think Jane left?

48:07.500 --> 48:09.250
She didn't!

48:13.000 --> 48:14.458
She didn't leave.

48:14.458 --> 48:16.666
Jane left because
you're a fucking nothing.

48:16.666 --> 48:18.250
You're a joke!

48:18.250 --> 48:20.083
She never loved you!

48:20.083 --> 48:22.791
She pitied you,
and then she despised you,

48:22.791 --> 48:24.833
and you drove her away!

48:24.833 --> 48:27.833
You're a fucking retard
who drove my sister away.

48:27.833 --> 48:30.208
We all lost her because of you.

48:57.916 --> 48:59.625
-That's mine!

49:02.166 --> 49:04.458
Dirty.

49:09.458 --> 49:11.041
Mrs. Huggins, I'll do that.

49:11.041 --> 49:12.000
Oh!

49:12.000 --> 49:13.875
Poor Terry.

49:13.875 --> 49:15.583
Come and sit down.

49:19.208 --> 49:20.916
Let me take care of you.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.666
Yeah.

49:36.791 --> 49:38.541
Dr. Huggins!

49:41.833 --> 49:43.083
Yes?

49:43.083 --> 49:44.500
I want to see Nathan.

49:44.500 --> 49:47.583
The wound was much more
serious than I thought.

49:47.583 --> 49:51.083
He should pull through,
but it will take some --

49:54.500 --> 49:56.708
I just gave him something.

49:56.708 --> 49:58.791
The pain was...

49:58.791 --> 50:00.541
He's sleeping like a baby now.

50:00.541 --> 50:02.750
He's going to need
a lot of rest.

50:09.541 --> 50:11.333
Are you sure he's...

50:11.333 --> 50:13.500
RICHARD:
If you just stand back...

50:27.666 --> 50:29.375
Right.

50:31.708 --> 50:33.041
There. Normal.

50:33.041 --> 50:34.541
I assure you,

50:34.541 --> 50:36.708
there's nothing to worry about.

50:36.708 --> 50:39.750
Then why couldn't
I feel anything?

50:39.750 --> 50:41.041
Why is he so cold?

50:41.041 --> 50:42.541
Where's the fucking ambulance?

50:42.541 --> 50:44.625
Oh, it shouldn't be long now,
I expect,

50:44.625 --> 50:48.791
but I'm happy to call them
if this puts your mind at rest.

50:49.875 --> 50:51.583
You stay with him.

51:12.250 --> 51:13.291
RICHARD: Hello!

51:13.291 --> 51:15.375
Richard Huggins. Yes, yes.

51:15.375 --> 51:19.708
I called for an ambulance
a few minutes ago.

51:19.708 --> 51:20.708
Yes.

51:20.708 --> 51:24.083
Can you tell me
how long it will be?

51:24.083 --> 51:26.875
Right you are.

51:26.875 --> 51:28.625
Thank you so very much.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.291
It's on its way.

51:32.291 --> 51:34.125
Shouldn't be long now.

51:34.125 --> 51:35.250
Oh, goodness.

51:35.250 --> 51:37.833
You don't look at all well.

51:44.291 --> 51:45.958
Quite normal to feel this way

51:45.958 --> 51:48.375
after what you've been through

51:48.375 --> 51:50.625
and in your condition.

51:50.625 --> 51:53.125
-I'm okay.
-Oh, no, you're not, my dear.

51:53.125 --> 51:57.291
You're not okay, but never fear.

51:57.291 --> 52:00.875
I've just the thing somewhere.

52:06.708 --> 52:09.125
Got you.
These should buck you up.

52:09.125 --> 52:10.833
Two of these should
do the trick.

52:10.833 --> 52:12.375
Trust me, my dear.

52:12.375 --> 52:15.000
I've dealt with many cases
just like yours --

52:15.000 --> 52:18.583
shock, anxiety, PTSD.

52:18.583 --> 52:22.625
These chaps are most effective.

52:34.166 --> 52:35.166
ELLEN: There.

52:35.166 --> 52:36.375
That didn't hurt, did it?

52:36.375 --> 52:38.333
I told you so.

52:38.333 --> 52:40.708
You're a big brave boy.

52:48.291 --> 52:50.000
Your shoes.

52:53.666 --> 52:56.833
Soon, you won't feel
anything nasty at all.

53:01.750 --> 53:04.666
ELLEN: I've had just about
enough of this, Kate,

53:04.666 --> 53:07.291
dragging goodness knows what
into our house.

53:07.291 --> 53:11.000
I've told you a thousand times,

53:11.000 --> 53:13.791
shoes off at the door!

53:16.000 --> 53:18.500
RICHARD: Ellen!

53:18.500 --> 53:21.083
Come, my dear.

53:21.083 --> 53:22.875
This isn't Kate.

53:22.875 --> 53:26.916
This is Mary,
one of our young guests.

53:26.916 --> 53:30.041
You remember Mary,
Mary and Jane Voller,

53:30.041 --> 53:32.791
the twins from the village.

53:32.791 --> 53:34.708
ELLEN: Mary?

53:34.708 --> 53:38.666
Mary Voller, how she's grown!

53:38.666 --> 53:40.250
What did you give him?

53:40.250 --> 53:43.250
Oh, a perfectly standard
analgesic.

53:43.250 --> 53:45.291
Ellen was my nurse
for many years,

53:45.291 --> 53:47.041
a very efficient nurse,

53:47.041 --> 53:50.916
and a most lovely one, too,
I might add.

53:50.916 --> 53:52.500
Come, my dear.

53:52.500 --> 53:54.750
Let's make our guests
a nice cup of tea.

53:54.750 --> 53:59.916
Oh, haven't we forgotten
something?

53:59.916 --> 54:03.166
Behind you.

54:03.166 --> 54:05.333
Warmer.

54:05.333 --> 54:08.333
Warmer.

54:08.333 --> 54:09.958
Hot.

54:09.958 --> 54:12.500
Red-hot.

54:12.500 --> 54:14.458
On the left.

54:16.541 --> 54:18.541
Oh!

54:18.541 --> 54:19.875
The needles.

54:19.875 --> 54:21.708
I have to put the needles away.

54:21.708 --> 54:24.750
Good girl. And why do we have
to put the needles away?

54:24.750 --> 54:28.583
Because needles are sharp,
and someone could get hurt.

54:28.583 --> 54:30.583
Someone could get hurt.

54:30.583 --> 54:33.500
Bravo, darling.

54:33.500 --> 54:36.291
We can't let
the bloody disease win.

54:36.291 --> 54:38.583
I constantly jog her memory,

54:38.583 --> 54:41.500
give her little challenges,

54:41.500 --> 54:44.500
little goals,
make a game of life.

54:44.500 --> 54:46.041
It's vital.

54:46.041 --> 54:50.083
Whatever it takes
to keep my Ellen with me.

54:54.875 --> 54:59.000
♪ Sweeping with this
great big broom ♪

55:00.458 --> 55:02.875
♪ Sweeping till
it's nice and clean ♪

55:02.875 --> 55:06.791
♪ You would never know it's me ♪

55:11.000 --> 55:13.708
♪ Washing, washing, washing up ♪

55:13.708 --> 55:16.500
We have to get out.

55:16.500 --> 55:18.333
Give me your phone.

55:18.333 --> 55:19.708
What?

55:19.708 --> 55:21.916
Your phone, quick.

55:21.916 --> 55:22.916
Use your own phone.

55:22.916 --> 55:24.791
I-I haven't got it.

55:28.041 --> 55:29.500
Terry!

55:29.500 --> 55:31.333
-What?
-The fucking phone!

55:31.333 --> 55:32.666
We have to call for help!

55:32.666 --> 55:35.583
RICHARD: Are we alright, Terry?

55:35.583 --> 55:38.750
Lovely, Dr. Huggins!

55:38.750 --> 55:41.416
Look, I told you,
I haven't got it.

55:41.416 --> 55:43.333
Yeah?

55:46.250 --> 55:48.041
Hey! What?

55:48.041 --> 55:49.541
MARY: Where is it?

55:49.541 --> 55:51.708
I gave it to Mrs. Huggins.

55:51.708 --> 55:54.416
You can't expect her
to trust us.

55:54.416 --> 55:56.250
And you trust them?

55:56.250 --> 55:57.541
We need to get out of here now!

55:57.541 --> 56:00.875
-Nathan's d--

56:00.875 --> 56:02.333
Tea time!

56:06.833 --> 56:08.208
RICHARD: There we are.

56:08.208 --> 56:09.375
TERRY: Thanks, Dr. Huggins.

56:09.375 --> 56:12.708
RICHARD: There's a good boy.

56:12.708 --> 56:13.875
ELLEN: I'll sit over here.

56:13.875 --> 56:16.666
RICHARD: Lead the way.

56:16.666 --> 56:17.791
ELLEN: Terry?

56:20.250 --> 56:22.250
ELLEN: Tea for Mary.

56:22.250 --> 56:24.000
RICHARD: There.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.708
How is that ankle doing, Terry?

56:26.708 --> 56:28.708
M-Much better.
Thanks, Dr. Huggins.

56:28.708 --> 56:30.750
The injection really helped.

56:30.750 --> 56:33.041
I can hardly feel a thing.

56:33.041 --> 56:34.708
Glad to hear it.

56:34.708 --> 56:36.500
It's a pity you refused my help.

56:36.500 --> 56:38.750
You'd be feeling
much better, too.

56:38.750 --> 56:41.666
Don't you think she looks
a bit peaky?

56:41.666 --> 56:44.541
Not well at all.

56:50.166 --> 56:51.916
No. No, no.

56:51.916 --> 56:53.875
Filthy!

56:53.875 --> 56:55.791
I'll smoke it outside.

57:01.250 --> 57:02.833
RICHARD: I'm sorry,

57:02.833 --> 57:05.708
but I'm sure you understand
I can't allow that.

57:05.708 --> 57:07.458
Please sit here.

57:07.458 --> 57:11.333
Drink your tea and wait
for the ambulance to arrive.

57:11.333 --> 57:15.875
Besides, you must think
about your unborn child.

57:15.875 --> 57:19.916
Smoking can cause
any number of problems,

57:19.916 --> 57:22.000
appalling birth defects,

57:22.000 --> 57:25.500
carcinomas, teratomas,

57:25.500 --> 57:30.333
babies born with their brains
on the outside of their skulls.

57:30.333 --> 57:35.458
I'd like to commend you once
again for your courage, my dear.

57:35.458 --> 57:39.458
What you did wasn't easy,
taking a human life,

57:39.458 --> 57:42.791
and we survived thanks to you.

57:48.125 --> 57:49.875
RICHARD: Oh.

57:52.291 --> 57:56.416
Oh, we really must fumigate
this place again soon.

57:56.416 --> 57:58.750
We're plagued by vermin --

57:58.750 --> 58:02.166
moths, silverfish,

58:02.166 --> 58:04.500
cockroaches,

58:04.500 --> 58:08.416
every sort of pest.

58:08.416 --> 58:10.916
Sit down, Mary.
Drink your tea.

58:10.916 --> 58:15.666
Under the circumstances,
it's hardly polite to refuse.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.625
Come on.

58:19.625 --> 58:21.333
Mary!

58:46.041 --> 58:49.208
When Kate was born
the way she was,

58:49.208 --> 58:52.166
it took everything we had
not to believe that she was,

58:52.166 --> 58:55.958
in some way,
a punishment from God.

59:00.166 --> 59:03.166
Yes, we loved her
and tended her,

59:03.166 --> 59:05.958
and she grew up
into a wonderful girl,

59:05.958 --> 59:10.291
beautiful, sensitive,
a wonderful girl.

59:13.166 --> 59:15.500
We tried to protect her
and educate her

59:15.500 --> 59:17.791
and make sure
she minded her manners

59:17.791 --> 59:21.541
and did what was right.

59:21.541 --> 59:24.125
There were times
when she resisted,

59:24.125 --> 59:26.375
and sometimes
she turned on us,

59:26.375 --> 59:30.750
but we stood firm
and never faltered.

59:30.750 --> 59:36.750
Ellen and I never once
resented the task,

59:36.750 --> 59:39.125
never once despaired.

59:43.583 --> 59:46.791
Come, come, darling.

59:46.791 --> 59:50.333
I -- I am --
I'm such a scatterbrain.

59:50.333 --> 59:52.791
Such a silly, ditzy thing.

59:52.791 --> 59:56.833
Ah, you're my silly,
ditzy thing.

59:56.833 --> 59:58.583
Of course.

59:58.583 --> 1:00:00.500
The biscuit is for Mary.

1:00:07.750 --> 1:00:09.375
Here you go, Mrs. Huggins.

1:00:25.708 --> 1:00:28.250
The scrapbook was Ellen's idea.

1:00:28.250 --> 1:00:33.166
She keeps it going,
and it's good for her memory.

1:00:33.166 --> 1:00:37.000
Such detail, all Ellen's work.

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:42.041
Her very own tribute
to all those lost little souls.

1:00:42.041 --> 1:00:45.333
Isn't it extraordinary?

1:00:45.333 --> 1:00:48.416
Oh.

1:00:48.416 --> 1:00:50.333
Such a terrible loss.

1:00:53.541 --> 1:00:56.041
Of course, you both understand.

1:01:01.250 --> 1:01:04.833
Ellen, love.

1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:10.000
It's hot.

1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:13.333
You have to let tea stand
when it's too hot.

1:01:13.333 --> 1:01:15.041
Yeah.

1:01:21.625 --> 1:01:23.666
Could I have my phone back?

1:01:23.666 --> 1:01:25.416
I need to call Nathan's mother.

1:01:25.416 --> 1:01:27.541
I'm sorry, my dear.
I don't understand.

1:01:27.541 --> 1:01:29.458
Nathan had my phone.

1:01:29.458 --> 1:01:33.208
It's not in his pocket.
I know you have it.

1:01:33.208 --> 1:01:36.541
If it wasn't for Nathan,
you'd both be dead!

1:01:36.541 --> 1:01:37.875
You lied about the ambulance.

1:01:37.875 --> 1:01:40.541
You never called.
The phone is broken.

1:01:40.541 --> 1:01:42.166
What did you do to him?

1:01:42.166 --> 1:01:44.291
Tell me what the fuck
is going on!

1:01:44.291 --> 1:01:47.583
Come now, pull yourself
together, Mary.

1:01:47.583 --> 1:01:50.875
You're upset.
That's perfectly understandable,

1:01:50.875 --> 1:01:52.375
but letting your emotions

1:01:52.375 --> 1:01:55.916
get the better of you
won't help anyone.

1:01:55.916 --> 1:01:58.791
Drink your tea like a good girl!

1:02:00.166 --> 1:02:02.583
Ah!

1:02:02.583 --> 1:02:04.166
Open the door!

1:02:04.166 --> 1:02:07.500
Mary, come, you're exhausted,
probably in shock.

1:02:07.500 --> 1:02:10.125
-Open the door!
-Your hormones are raging.

1:02:10.125 --> 1:02:13.375
You can't see the wood
for the trees.

1:02:13.375 --> 1:02:14.916
Come now, let's not be silly.

1:02:14.916 --> 1:02:16.791
This is not helping anyone.

1:02:16.791 --> 1:02:18.291
MARY: Open the fucking door!

1:02:18.291 --> 1:02:19.750
Ah, ah!

1:02:19.750 --> 1:02:24.708
I don't like to cause you pain,
but you give me no choice!

1:02:24.708 --> 1:02:27.083
Someone like that wants
to become a mother.

1:02:27.083 --> 1:02:29.583
RICHARD: This behavior
is simply unacceptable!

1:02:29.583 --> 1:02:32.333
Children need a proper mommy
and daddy,

1:02:32.333 --> 1:02:35.250
not a nasty tramp
like this one!

1:02:35.250 --> 1:02:37.875
-MARY: Ah!
-She will soon calm down.

1:02:37.875 --> 1:02:40.916
The cupboard always works.

1:02:40.916 --> 1:02:42.958
MARY: Ah, let me out!

1:02:42.958 --> 1:02:44.708
Let me out!
What the fuck?!

1:02:44.708 --> 1:02:46.583
I don't know what's wrong
with her.

1:02:46.583 --> 1:02:48.166
-I've never seen her like this.
-MARY: Open the fucking door!

1:02:48.166 --> 1:02:50.083
You should be very careful,
Terry.

1:02:50.083 --> 1:02:51.375
A girl like that...

1:02:51.375 --> 1:02:52.666
MARY: Terry,
don't listen to them!

1:02:52.666 --> 1:02:54.000
-...she's a liar...
-MARY: Terry!

1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.916
...a nasty, dirty parasite,
poison!

1:02:56.916 --> 1:02:58.125
MARY: What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1:02:58.125 --> 1:03:00.500
-You deserve so much better.

1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:03.250
RICHARD: Now, dear, this has all
been a bit too much for you.

1:03:03.250 --> 1:03:04.750
-MARY: Let me out!
-Terry will watch her.

1:03:04.750 --> 1:03:08.000
Won't you, Terry,
until the ambulance arrives?

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:09.583
-Terry?
-Yes, dear.

1:03:09.583 --> 1:03:12.083
I'll be down as soon as Ellen
is in bed.

1:03:12.083 --> 1:03:13.375
MARY: Terry, Terry, please!

1:03:13.375 --> 1:03:15.666
TERRY: You can trust me,
Mrs. Huggins.

1:03:15.666 --> 1:03:18.083
MARY: Terry, let me out, please!

1:03:22.125 --> 1:03:26.291
MARY: Terry, don't listen
to them, please!

1:03:26.291 --> 1:03:28.125
Let me out!

1:03:41.958 --> 1:03:46.625
Terry, let me out!

1:03:46.625 --> 1:03:47.708
You're not well.

1:03:47.708 --> 1:03:49.083
Dr. Huggins is right,

1:03:49.083 --> 1:03:51.208
it's your hormones
or whatever he said.

1:03:51.208 --> 1:03:53.000
Oh, just get over it
and let me out!

1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.666
Don't speak to me like that!

1:03:55.666 --> 1:03:59.166
You never speak to Nathan
like that.

1:03:59.166 --> 1:04:00.625
He treats you like shit.

1:04:00.625 --> 1:04:03.541
I don't even understand
why you're with him.

1:04:03.541 --> 1:04:08.291
He just uses you,
and he slags you off.

1:04:08.291 --> 1:04:10.791
He doesn't love you.

1:04:10.791 --> 1:04:12.541
He's never loved you.

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.708
He's dead.

1:05:01.583 --> 1:05:07.333
Darling, no, please, stay calm,
please, stay calm.

1:05:07.333 --> 1:05:09.750
She needs to be punished.

1:05:09.750 --> 1:05:12.125
Of course, darling.
I'll take care of it.

1:05:12.125 --> 1:05:14.625
No, no.

1:05:14.625 --> 1:05:16.833
I want to take care of it.

1:05:16.833 --> 1:05:18.333
Shh, you're retired.

1:05:18.333 --> 1:05:21.041
No, she needs
to be punished now.

1:05:21.041 --> 1:05:22.250
Shh.

1:05:22.250 --> 1:05:25.250
She's been so bad.

1:05:25.250 --> 1:05:28.375
She'll ruin everything.

1:05:28.375 --> 1:05:30.916
Now I want us to punish her now.

1:05:30.916 --> 1:05:33.625
Are you sure, darling?

1:05:33.625 --> 1:05:36.541
Yes, yes, yes!

1:05:36.541 --> 1:05:40.083
Very well,
if that's what you want.

1:05:47.125 --> 1:05:49.083
TERRY: 10 minutes ago, he said
it was going to be okay.

1:05:49.083 --> 1:05:50.708
Dr. Huggins killed him!

1:05:50.708 --> 1:05:52.250
We've known the Huggins
our whole lives.

1:05:52.250 --> 1:05:55.208
-They never --
-Open this fucking door!

1:05:55.208 --> 1:05:57.041
MARY: What is wrong with you?

1:05:58.708 --> 1:06:00.458
Hurry up!

1:06:03.583 --> 1:06:05.333
-Shit.
-MARY: What is it?

1:06:05.333 --> 1:06:07.083
She must have given me
a bit too much of the --

1:06:07.083 --> 1:06:08.666
MARY: Terry,
what the fuck are you --

1:06:08.666 --> 1:06:11.833
The injection, Mrs. Huggins
must have given --

1:06:11.833 --> 1:06:14.375
My leg has gone numb!

1:06:14.375 --> 1:06:17.041
MARY: Don't you understand?

1:06:17.041 --> 1:06:20.416
Terry, get it open!

1:06:20.416 --> 1:06:23.833
What the fuck are you doing?

1:06:23.833 --> 1:06:26.583
-Terry!

1:06:26.583 --> 1:06:29.208
MARY: Terry!

1:06:29.208 --> 1:06:30.875
D-Dr. Huggins?

1:06:30.875 --> 1:06:32.041
MARY: What the fuck
are you doing?

1:06:32.041 --> 1:06:35.375
Stop. D-Dr. Huggins?

1:06:35.375 --> 1:06:38.541
MARY: Terry, shut up,
you dumb fuck!

1:06:40.708 --> 1:06:42.041
Dr. Huggins?

1:06:42.041 --> 1:06:43.666
Don't you fucking get it?

1:06:43.666 --> 1:06:45.458
Shut up!

1:06:45.458 --> 1:06:50.041
Shut the fuck up,
speaking to me like that!

1:06:52.666 --> 1:06:54.500
I'm not shit!

1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:56.916
Shit!

1:06:56.916 --> 1:07:00.375
I'm not shit.

1:07:05.166 --> 1:07:07.375
MARY: I'm sorry.

1:07:07.375 --> 1:07:13.083
Listen, we can still
get out of this,

1:07:13.083 --> 1:07:15.250
but we've got to be together.

1:07:18.208 --> 1:07:21.791
What do you mean, "Together"?

1:07:23.458 --> 1:07:27.416
-MARY: I can't do it on my own.
-No, no, no, no, what --

1:07:27.416 --> 1:07:30.208
w-w-what do you mean by,
"Together"?

1:07:30.208 --> 1:07:32.916
Listen, Terry, now is not
really the time.

1:07:32.916 --> 1:07:34.750
It is!

1:07:34.750 --> 1:07:37.250
It is the time.

1:07:37.250 --> 1:07:40.416
Answer me, please.

1:07:40.416 --> 1:07:42.625
What do you mean by, "Together"?

1:07:42.625 --> 1:07:45.166
I don't know what...

1:07:45.166 --> 1:07:46.791
You mean...

1:07:46.791 --> 1:07:50.500
You mean like before,

1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:53.041
how we were before?

1:07:53.041 --> 1:07:54.041
What?

1:07:54.041 --> 1:07:57.000
Before,

1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.166
when we loved each other.

1:08:00.166 --> 1:08:04.500
But -- But you were with --

1:08:04.500 --> 1:08:07.250
You.

1:08:07.250 --> 1:08:11.250
Only you came, just you.

1:08:11.250 --> 1:08:12.916
What are you talking about?

1:08:12.916 --> 1:08:18.666
I'm talking about us,

1:08:18.666 --> 1:08:23.208
house that we were going to get,

1:08:23.208 --> 1:08:24.375
remember?

1:08:24.375 --> 1:08:27.416
Stop it. Please, don't. It's...

1:08:28.791 --> 1:08:31.750
We were good together.

1:08:31.750 --> 1:08:33.291
You know it.

1:08:33.291 --> 1:08:35.458
You're scaring me.

1:08:35.458 --> 1:08:37.958
Everybody said so.

1:08:37.958 --> 1:08:39.541
MARY: Don't do this.

1:08:39.541 --> 1:08:41.375
Don't leave me here.

1:08:41.375 --> 1:08:44.125
Leave you?

1:08:44.125 --> 1:08:47.875
Hold on,
why would I leave you?

1:08:51.375 --> 1:08:56.333
Jane, where are you going?

1:08:56.333 --> 1:08:59.083
Jane!

1:09:05.791 --> 1:09:07.041
Jane, where are you going?

1:09:07.041 --> 1:09:08.708
We --

1:09:08.708 --> 1:09:12.166
We have to get the keys.
Wait here.

1:09:12.166 --> 1:09:15.083
Jane!

1:10:12.583 --> 1:10:14.666
He's just fucking asleep.

1:10:14.666 --> 1:10:16.458
He's asleep, she said.

1:10:22.625 --> 1:10:24.541
She's a fucking liar.

1:10:24.541 --> 1:10:27.000
Where is she?

1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:28.333
Jane?

1:10:30.250 --> 1:10:32.791
She never liked me.

1:10:47.041 --> 1:10:49.333
-Jane.

1:10:49.333 --> 1:10:52.083
TERRY: What are you doing?

1:10:52.083 --> 1:10:54.583
I was going to go and get you.

1:10:54.583 --> 1:10:56.250
TERRY: You were leaving me.

1:10:56.250 --> 1:10:58.041
No, no, no.

1:10:58.041 --> 1:11:01.083
I could have, but I didn't,
but we have to hurry.

1:11:01.083 --> 1:11:03.916
We have to go quickly
because they could be anywhere.

1:11:06.583 --> 1:11:09.875
Don't lie.

1:11:09.875 --> 1:11:11.208
You were leaving me.

1:11:11.208 --> 1:11:12.541
MARY: No, no,
I-I wouldn't do that.

1:11:12.541 --> 1:11:14.458
I wouldn't do that.

1:11:14.458 --> 1:11:16.625
Now we can go together.

1:11:16.625 --> 1:11:18.250
-Okay?
-Huh?

1:11:18.250 --> 1:11:20.291
Get out of here together.

1:11:25.166 --> 1:11:30.666
MARY: Terry, Terry, Terry,
get off!

1:11:52.208 --> 1:11:55.583
MARY: Fuck!

1:11:57.583 --> 1:11:59.625
Where the fuck are you?

1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:03.833
Fuck!

1:12:03.833 --> 1:12:06.458
Come on!

1:12:12.458 --> 1:12:15.625
Fucking -- Come on, come on.

1:12:20.291 --> 1:12:23.375
-MARY: Terry!
-TERRY: Ah!

1:12:23.375 --> 1:12:26.375
Terry, get up.

1:12:26.375 --> 1:12:28.375
-TERRY: Jane?
-MARY: Get up, get up.

1:12:33.875 --> 1:12:36.708
We have to save the Huggins.

1:12:36.708 --> 1:12:39.125
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1:12:39.125 --> 1:12:40.583
Cover your mouth.

1:12:58.916 --> 1:13:00.583
ELLEN: Mary!

1:13:03.958 --> 1:13:05.375
Ah!

1:13:05.375 --> 1:13:08.500
ELLEN: Mary!

1:13:12.250 --> 1:13:15.666
Where are you?

1:13:19.458 --> 1:13:21.500
Terry!

1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.166
-Ah!

1:13:57.875 --> 1:13:59.083
TERRY: Help!

1:14:00.791 --> 1:14:02.708
MARY: Terry!

1:14:10.375 --> 1:14:13.041
What was that, you old bitch?

1:14:13.041 --> 1:14:15.083
What was that?

1:14:34.500 --> 1:14:37.916
What did you just give me?

1:14:37.916 --> 1:14:39.916
What was in the fucking syringe?

1:14:39.916 --> 1:14:42.250
Ah!

1:14:46.583 --> 1:14:50.666
RICHARD: This is no way
to behave, young lady!

1:14:58.083 --> 1:14:59.333
Yeah!

1:15:12.541 --> 1:15:14.583
RICHARD: Put this on,
my darling.

1:16:16.583 --> 1:16:19.583
RICHARD: Just fine, darling,
I'm right here.

1:16:19.583 --> 1:16:23.583
She's about one minute away from
getting her fucking throat slit!

1:16:23.583 --> 1:16:25.500
Give me the keys, now!

1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:26.750
RICHARD: Don't hurt her.

1:16:26.750 --> 1:16:27.958
I'm not joking!
I'll kill her!

1:16:27.958 --> 1:16:29.416
RICHARD: Alright, alright!

1:16:29.416 --> 1:16:30.583
I'll -- I'll --
I'll give you the keys.

1:16:30.583 --> 1:16:33.791
Just give me a moment.

1:16:33.791 --> 1:16:35.500
I just need to find them.

1:16:46.500 --> 1:16:48.916
What did she give me?

1:16:48.916 --> 1:16:50.791
RICHARD: A relaxant.

1:16:50.791 --> 1:16:53.291
The effect is rapid
but temporary.

1:16:53.291 --> 1:16:56.041
It'll wear off
after a few hours.

1:16:56.041 --> 1:16:57.958
Give me the keys!

1:16:57.958 --> 1:17:01.208
RICHARD: The drug will paralyze
your limbs one after the other,

1:17:01.208 --> 1:17:03.708
one arm, then the other,

1:17:03.708 --> 1:17:06.375
one leg, then the other.

1:17:06.375 --> 1:17:10.291
I should think you have about
30 minutes' mobility left...

1:17:10.291 --> 1:17:12.250
-Give me the keys, now!
-RICHARD: ...more or less.

1:17:12.250 --> 1:17:14.583
-I'm going to give you the keys!
-Now!

1:17:14.583 --> 1:17:16.291
RICHARD: Of course. Alright.

1:17:16.291 --> 1:17:19.000
Right now, yes, but -- but --
but your friend!

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.333
Don't you want Terry?

1:17:21.333 --> 1:17:23.833
Of course I want Terry!
I want Terry and the keys!

1:17:23.833 --> 1:17:27.125
RICHARD: Very good.

1:17:27.125 --> 1:17:29.833
Listen, Terry, if you help me,
I can take you --

1:17:29.833 --> 1:17:32.833
-MARY: What are you doing?
-RICHARD: I just need to think!

1:17:32.833 --> 1:17:35.000
About what?
Now, or I gut her!

1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:36.625
RICHARD: I know where she is.

1:17:36.625 --> 1:17:39.541
Terry, all you have to do
is just...

1:17:39.541 --> 1:17:41.791
-Richard.
-RICHARD: Don't worry, darling.

1:17:41.791 --> 1:17:43.166
Everything's fine.

1:17:43.166 --> 1:17:45.541
No, darling,
everything's fucked!

1:17:45.541 --> 1:17:47.916
Bring Terry over to the door
with the keys!

1:17:47.916 --> 1:17:50.000
RICHARD: Of course,
and in exchange?

1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:52.166
No, I'm not fucking negotiating!

1:17:52.166 --> 1:17:54.333
You get her back when
I've got Terry and the keys!

1:17:54.333 --> 1:17:56.958
RICHARD: You must give me
your assurance that --

1:17:56.958 --> 1:18:00.541
that she won't be hurt,
or we don't have a deal!

1:18:00.541 --> 1:18:02.041
Okay, then she'll talk.

1:18:02.041 --> 1:18:05.541
She'll talk to you all the time.

1:18:05.541 --> 1:18:06.750
Do you hear me?

1:18:06.750 --> 1:18:09.541
RICHARD: Ellen, darling?

1:18:12.500 --> 1:18:14.208
Fucking say something!

1:18:14.208 --> 1:18:17.500
-RICHARD: Darling, are you hurt?
-Oh, she's -- she's losing it!

1:18:17.500 --> 1:18:20.125
-RICHARD: Darling?
-Say something!

Fucking freaks.

1:22:49.458 --> 1:22:51.541
RICHARD: Oh.

1:22:51.541 --> 1:22:57.791
Oh, that's doesn't look good,
Mary.

1:22:57.791 --> 1:22:59.583
Not good at all.

1:23:01.458 --> 1:23:05.875
Young Terry is no mean marksman,
it seems.

1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:11.333
Shouldn't be long now.

1:23:11.333 --> 1:23:12.875
And there's also the chance

1:23:12.875 --> 1:23:14.833
that the effects of
the drugs with which

1:23:14.833 --> 1:23:16.958
my Ellen injected you,

1:23:16.958 --> 1:23:21.333
one of my racier
little concoctions,

1:23:21.333 --> 1:23:23.458
won't help with the pain.

1:23:26.208 --> 1:23:27.750
It's almost a pity.

1:23:27.750 --> 1:23:31.958
We even considered whether or
not you could somehow stay

1:23:31.958 --> 1:23:35.291
as an occasional stand-in.

1:23:35.291 --> 1:23:36.708
Yes.

1:23:36.708 --> 1:23:41.708
She's grown a bit worn,
rather damaged.

1:23:41.708 --> 1:23:43.000
We thought about it,
Ellen and I.

1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:44.791
We really did.

1:23:44.791 --> 1:23:49.500
And your spirit certainly made
an impression on us both.

1:23:49.500 --> 1:23:52.208
That business with the hammer.

1:23:52.208 --> 1:23:54.666
Yes, we discussed it,

1:23:54.666 --> 1:23:59.416
but in the end, we decided
best stick with what you know.

1:24:03.875 --> 1:24:07.708
Just a few minutes more,

1:24:07.708 --> 1:24:12.875
and then a lovely long sleep.

1:24:12.875 --> 1:24:14.583
Goodbye, Mary.

1:24:22.041 --> 1:24:26.000
I knew we could trust you.

1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:27.833
ELLEN: Terry has been
a very good boy,

1:24:27.833 --> 1:24:31.166
and good children
get their just desserts.

1:24:48.083 --> 1:24:52.333
RICHARD:
Our lovely special star,

1:24:52.333 --> 1:24:55.083
so very bright,

1:24:55.083 --> 1:25:00.125
but too fragile
for this world.

1:25:00.125 --> 1:25:01.541
Ah!

1:25:09.416 --> 1:25:11.250
ELLEN: Look.

1:25:27.375 --> 1:25:30.625
After she was taken,
Ellen was inconsolable.

1:25:30.625 --> 1:25:33.791
She needed another another child
to fill the void.

1:25:33.791 --> 1:25:38.208
We tried a number,
quite a number of girls,

1:25:38.208 --> 1:25:41.083
but none of them
were quite right enough.

1:25:41.083 --> 1:25:42.541
ELLEN: Not right at all.

1:25:42.541 --> 1:25:45.333
RICHARD: And then one lovely
summer's evening,

1:25:45.333 --> 1:25:47.833
on a station platform...

1:25:47.833 --> 1:25:50.333
Here we are, Terry,
as I promised.

1:25:50.333 --> 1:25:53.500
My beautiful darling Kate.

1:25:59.250 --> 1:26:01.166
RICHARD: We brought someone
to see you.

1:26:01.166 --> 1:26:03.250
ELLEN: It's a surprise.

1:26:03.250 --> 1:26:05.541
We'll take good care of you.

1:26:05.541 --> 1:26:07.916
RICHARD: And we'll be a family.

1:27:21.791 --> 1:27:23.250
RICHARD: When, darling?

1:27:23.250 --> 1:27:25.000
ELLEN: In the spring.

1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:26.750
RICHARD: Lovely idea.

1:27:29.916 --> 1:27:34.750
Farming, Mrs. Huggins,
at this time of year?

1:27:34.750 --> 1:27:37.291
A bit late, isn't it?

1:27:37.291 --> 1:27:42.208
Oh, no. Three new bushes.
They make such delicious jam.

1:27:42.208 --> 1:27:45.541
The children love it so.

1:27:45.541 --> 1:27:47.416
Have you finished?

1:27:47.416 --> 1:27:50.541
Yes, Mrs. Huggins.

1:27:50.541 --> 1:27:52.291
What happened to the door?

1:27:52.291 --> 1:27:54.625
Another infestation, yes.

1:27:54.625 --> 1:27:57.416
I've had to spray everything.

1:27:57.416 --> 1:27:59.458
Bloody silverfish.

1:27:59.458 --> 1:28:01.458
ELLEN: Is --
Is everything alright?

1:28:01.458 --> 1:28:05.125
You -- You seem a-a-a little,
um...

1:28:05.125 --> 1:28:06.958
Preoccupied?

1:28:06.958 --> 1:28:11.166
Oh, ah, no, I don't want
to trouble --

1:28:11.166 --> 1:28:14.000
trouble you with my problems.

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:15.958
Oh, but you must!

1:28:15.958 --> 1:28:17.500
What is it?

1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:18.916
Oh, I'm --
I'm sure it's nothing.

1:28:18.916 --> 1:28:20.666
I just haven't heard
from my Terry

1:28:20.666 --> 1:28:23.583
for nearly a week,
and it's not like him.

1:28:23.583 --> 1:28:24.791
Oh, you know what they say.

1:28:24.791 --> 1:28:27.208
Youth must have its fling.

1:28:27.208 --> 1:28:29.333
But the world has changed
since we were young.

1:28:29.333 --> 1:28:31.708
It's a much more
dangerous place,

1:28:31.708 --> 1:28:34.875
and my Terry, well,
he's so easily led.

1:28:34.875 --> 1:28:38.583
Ah, he's a splendid chap,
a credit to you.

1:28:38.583 --> 1:28:41.041
Everything will be just fine.

1:28:45.750 --> 1:28:49.083
Thank you, Mrs. Huggins.

1:28:49.083 --> 1:28:54.000
Yes, I am sure you're right,
Dr. Huggins.

1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.541
Always such a worry,
being a parent.

1:28:56.541 --> 1:28:57.875
Never stops.

1:29:01.625 --> 1:29:03.750
Anyway, must be off,

1:29:03.750 --> 1:29:07.125
and I will see you next week.

1:29:07.125 --> 1:29:08.458
Thank you.

1:29:08.458 --> 1:29:12.916
Have a lovely evening,
and don't worry!

1:29:12.916 --> 1:29:16.000
I'm sure you'll see him soon.

1:29:18.375 --> 1:29:22.041
That woman really is a treasure.

1:29:26.791 --> 1:29:29.250
And you are my treasure.
