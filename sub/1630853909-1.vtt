00:18.252 --> 00:20.788
- Nothing beats a good steak,

00:21.355 --> 00:23.190
unless you're a vegetarian
and you found out

00:23.290 --> 00:26.561
that you ate steak because
someone lied to you.

00:27.094 --> 00:30.030
In that case, the steak didn't hurt you,

00:30.130 --> 00:31.498
the truth did.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.902
But this story isn't about the truth.

00:34.002 --> 00:35.737
It's about a man.

00:35.837 --> 00:37.739
A man who dreamed about buying a home

00:37.839 --> 00:39.641
with the girl he loved.

00:39.741 --> 00:41.943
But if he was gonna do all that,

00:42.042 --> 00:45.379
he sure started off in the wrong spot.

- Um, hi, it's Rob, Rob Smart.

01:28.056 --> 01:29.389
I'm here to see an apartment.

01:29.489 --> 01:31.124
- Why you ain't say that, man?

01:34.829 --> 01:35.930
- Hey, DQ.

01:36.030 --> 01:38.533
Are the countertops in there marble?

01:39.567 --> 01:42.436
- Nah, they're the next best thing thoug

01:42.537 --> 01:46.040
- Well, the kitchen's really nice.

01:46.139 --> 01:49.010
You got tons of space for $1,200 a month

01:49.109 --> 01:50.410
- Yes, sir.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.446
You get a lot of bang for
your buck here in Beekstead.

01:52.547 --> 01:55.984
Speaking of which, the guy
upstairs on the second floor,

01:56.084 --> 01:56.985
he's in a rock band.

01:57.085 --> 01:58.452
So it gets a little loud sometimes,

01:58.553 --> 02:00.622
but they're pretty good, so...

02:04.191 --> 02:06.460
- It's my girlfriend. Do
you mind if I take this?

02:06.561 --> 02:08.428
- Motherfucker.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.898
She is way out of your league, bro.

02:10.999 --> 02:12.199
No disrespect.

02:13.735 --> 02:17.505
Well, look, if you need
anything, just give me a shout.

02:17.605 --> 02:18.539
Alright?

02:22.610 --> 02:23.377
- Hey.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.579
- Hey.

02:24.679 --> 02:27.314
So do you maybe want to meet
my parents another night?

02:27.414 --> 02:30.585
- Uh, why would I want to do that?

02:30.685 --> 02:32.854
- My parents are a little intimidating

02:32.954 --> 02:34.689
and I don't want to scare you off.

02:34.789 --> 02:37.625
- I appreciate you giving me
the out, but I don't need it.

02:37.725 --> 02:41.529
And I'm excited that I finally
get to meet your parents.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.398
And I have a feeling they're
really gonna like me.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.200
- Alright. Well, thanks for being brave.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.903
So, are you on your way?

02:52.740 --> 02:53.941
What is that?

02:54.042 --> 02:55.242
Did you walk into a concert?

02:55.342 --> 02:58.245
- Oh, Katie, it's just
the neighbors. I love you.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.180
I'll talk to you soon.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.217
- Would you like some more wine, Rob?

03:04.317 --> 03:05.119
- Absolutely.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.286
- Dear, would you do the honors?

03:06.386 --> 03:08.656
You're a tad bit more accessible to him.

03:08.756 --> 03:09.524
- You got it. Say when.

03:09.624 --> 03:12.492
- Oh, not too much though. I'm driving.

03:13.326 --> 03:14.662
- So, Rob,

03:14.762 --> 03:18.700
Katie says there's an interesting
story on how you two met.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.935
I would love to hear it.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.036
- Okay.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.539
Well, my friend Toby hits me up and says

03:24.639 --> 03:26.339
"I know this great girl named Katie.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.542
You're going on a blind date with her

03:27.642 --> 03:29.177
and I'm not taking no for an answer."

03:29.276 --> 03:31.045
So our blind date starts, we're talking,

03:31.145 --> 03:33.114
I am having the time of my life

03:33.213 --> 03:34.481
and Katie's laughing like a crazy person

03:34.582 --> 03:36.684
so I'm going to assume she
was having a good time.

03:36.784 --> 03:40.454
And then Katie notices
this guy staring at us.

03:40.555 --> 03:41.889
So he comes over and says,

03:41.989 --> 03:46.226
"Hey, I think you're supposed
to be on a date with me."

03:46.326 --> 03:47.528
And then at that moment,

03:47.628 --> 03:49.897
I realized that Katie wasn't the Katie

03:49.997 --> 03:51.199
I was supposed to meet.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.701
I wasn't the Rob that
she was supposed to meet.

03:53.801 --> 03:54.769
My Katie stood me up.

03:54.869 --> 03:57.437
And the thing is, I
think it had to be fate

03:57.538 --> 03:59.741
because what are the chances

03:59.841 --> 04:03.010
of me meeting a Katie that
was supposed to meet a Rob?

04:03.111 --> 04:07.414
- Wow. That is really some story.

04:07.515 --> 04:10.818
- Well, whoever that other
Katie was, she messed up.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.153
Rob's been great.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.554
- You snooze, you lose.

04:13.654 --> 04:17.058
Now that we're moving in
together, things are just perfect.

04:17.158 --> 04:18.291
- Hmm.

04:20.128 --> 04:21.328
- Yeah, I meant to tell you,

04:21.428 --> 04:24.264
we've been looking at apartments.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.600
- So where are you looking?

04:25.700 --> 04:28.368
- Oh, we saw some really
nice places in Beekstead.

04:33.908 --> 04:35.109
Beekstead?

04:35.209 --> 04:37.945
Oh, that's a great place.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.113
To get shot!

04:39.213 --> 04:40.815
- Dad, it's not.

04:40.915 --> 04:43.918
- I get it, Mr. Reynolds,
Beekstead has its rough spots,

04:44.018 --> 04:44.652
I'll admit it.

04:44.752 --> 04:45.887
But if it makes any better,

04:45.987 --> 04:47.922
Katie and I spend so
much time in the bedroom,

04:48.022 --> 04:49.957
that we barely go out anyway.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.593
- Excuse me?

04:53.861 --> 04:56.329
- Oh. Oh.

04:56.931 --> 04:58.266
That was a terrible joke.

04:58.365 --> 04:59.901
I'm just saying, we don't go out much.

05:00.001 --> 05:02.904
Not that I can afford to anyway.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.715
Mr. Reynolds?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.687
- Call me Julius, please.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.023
- Julius. Sure.

05:22.890 --> 05:26.359
I just wanted to say how
sorry I am for those jokes

05:26.459 --> 05:27.460
in there.

05:27.562 --> 05:28.863
They were insensitive, clearly not funny

05:28.963 --> 05:30.631
and definitely not the first
impression I want to make.

05:30.731 --> 05:34.467
- It's okay, Rob. I understand
and I accept your apology.

05:34.569 --> 05:36.537
You can relax with me.

05:36.637 --> 05:37.605
- Wow.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.440
Wave of relief.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.311
It's so hard meeting the
parents for the first time.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.513
- Oh, I hear ya, kid and don't sweat it,

05:45.613 --> 05:46.714
we're just people.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.482
And besides, I know
you're a very nice guy.

05:49.584 --> 05:50.450
- Thank you, Julius.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.552
- Don't mention it.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.821
I just need you to do me a small favor.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.089
- Sure, anything.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.891
- This whole thing with Katie,

05:56.991 --> 05:58.726
I'm going to need you
to find a way to end it

05:58.826 --> 06:02.096
without hurting her too badly.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.297
- Excuse me?

06:03.998 --> 06:07.034
- This whole thing with
my daughter and you,

06:07.134 --> 06:09.070
it's not going to work out.

06:09.170 --> 06:10.338
- Oh God. It's the jokes.

06:10.437 --> 06:13.007
- No, it's not the jokes, Rob, it's you.

06:13.107 --> 06:14.242
You're the joke.

06:14.342 --> 06:16.443
Take a look at Katie and look at yoursel

06:16.544 --> 06:18.346
Do you think you're
anywhere near her league?

06:18.445 --> 06:22.283
You're as far below her
station as one can be.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.851
I don't know what she sees in you.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.888
I know what I see in
you, and I see a peasant.

06:26.988 --> 06:30.992
You like to tell stories? Write a book.

06:31.092 --> 06:33.127
Nice guy? Make a friend.

06:33.227 --> 06:36.998
But my daughter doesn't
deserve a life lacking in worth

06:37.098 --> 06:40.368
in a disgusting apartment
in a dangerous neighborhood.

06:40.467 --> 06:41.736
By the time I was your age,

06:41.836 --> 06:43.436
I had already paid off this whole house

06:43.537 --> 06:44.906
and I was looking to buy a yacht.

06:45.006 --> 06:50.011
Do you think you'll ever be
able to buy a house like this?

06:50.111 --> 06:51.245
Never in a million years.

06:51.345 --> 06:54.447
Now that's the life for Katie.

06:54.548 --> 06:58.886
End it with grace, but end it, you must.

seconds, two seconds.

07:59.714 --> 08:01.248
We're moving in together.

08:01.349 --> 08:03.617
- What are you talking about?

08:04.185 --> 08:05.252
- I bought us a mansion, baby.

08:05.353 --> 08:07.888
- Rob, we've been looking
at places in Beekstead.

08:07.989 --> 08:10.891
You're going to tell me
you bought a mansion?

08:11.525 --> 08:12.426
- Damn right, I did.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.095
- How is that even possible?

08:14.195 --> 08:15.229
- Well,

08:15.329 --> 08:17.231
you know how I had that
conversation with your dad?

08:17.331 --> 08:19.266
- I told you that wasn't a big deal.

08:19.367 --> 08:23.337
- I know, but he said some
things that I needed to hear.

08:23.437 --> 08:24.672
I went into work the next day.

08:24.772 --> 08:27.575
- Rob, I just feel like
this was a huge decision

08:27.675 --> 08:30.011
and it kind of bothers me
that I wasn't a part of it.

08:30.111 --> 08:32.580
- I just really wanted to surprise you.

08:35.850 --> 08:37.218
- Wow.

08:38.052 --> 08:39.086
- Oh, yeah.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.357
And it came fully furnished.

08:44.358 --> 08:47.328
- I think I just
found my favorite part

08:47.428 --> 08:48.863
of the house.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.368
- So, I wanted to ask,

08:54.468 --> 08:57.271
That thing you said outside
about me not involving you,

08:57.371 --> 08:58.873
was that a fight?

08:58.973 --> 09:00.875
- I didn't think it was a fight.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.310
- I don't know. It was tense.

09:03.411 --> 09:08.282
Might've technically been a
fight and if it was a fight,

09:08.382 --> 09:12.253
we should, you know, make up.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.091
- Well, maybe it was a fight.

09:35.076 --> 09:36.377
- Howdy, neighbor.

09:36.477 --> 09:40.281
- Hi, I'm Rob, Rob Smart.

09:40.381 --> 09:41.115
Just moved in.

09:41.215 --> 09:41.982
- Yeah, I see that.

09:42.083 --> 09:43.584
I'm Sydney. Welcome to the neighborhood.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.853
- Thank you. It is a beautiful place.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.823
- Oh, it is, it is. A great
place to raise a family.

09:48.923 --> 09:49.723
- My thoughts exactly.

09:49.824 --> 09:51.692
- How big's your litter?

09:52.493 --> 09:53.360
- Excuse me?

09:53.461 --> 09:54.929
- How many kids are you at?

09:55.029 --> 09:57.298
- Oh, no, we're not up to that,

09:57.398 --> 09:58.699
just me and my girlfriend.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.769
- Oh, well, hot diggity dog.
I'm sure she's a keeper.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.205
You know, I got to tell
Ginnie you guys just moved in.

10:04.305 --> 10:06.273
She makes a mean casserole.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.542
- Well, all right then.

10:07.641 --> 10:08.809
- Yeah.

10:10.811 --> 10:15.182
- Um, oh, I should probably
get back to the lady.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.351
- Yeah, yeah. Listen,
I hear you, I hear you.

10:17.451 --> 10:20.221
I should be on my way too. Alright?

10:20.321 --> 10:21.523
Hey.

10:21.622 --> 10:23.624
Good luck finding it.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.092
- Huh?

10:25.192 --> 10:29.598
- I said, "Good luck finding it." (laugh

10:29.697 --> 10:31.432
- Finding what?

10:31.533 --> 10:32.700
- The treasure.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.368
- The treasure?

10:35.469 --> 10:37.572
- Hidden in the house.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.140
- What are you talking about?

10:39.240 --> 10:40.141
- There's a,

10:40.241 --> 10:41.142
you don't know?

10:41.242 --> 10:43.277
- I don't know what you're talking about

10:43.377 --> 10:44.411
- Shh, shh.

10:45.346 --> 10:48.716
Now look, the last fella
that lived in that house

10:48.816 --> 10:51.118
was into some sketchy business.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.555
I mean, he came to me to
try to hide some money

10:53.654 --> 10:55.022
from the IRS.

10:55.122 --> 10:58.259
I said "No way, Jose, I run a
legitimate accounting firm."

10:58.359 --> 11:02.631
He started hiding
the money in his mattress.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.064
And when it started hurting his back,

11:04.165 --> 11:05.900
he started hiding it in the walls.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.935
I mean, you could hear him
knocking all night long and

11:08.035 --> 11:10.838
not in the carnal sense,
if you get my drift.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.073
- Wow. What happened to him?

11:13.174 --> 11:15.610
- Oh, that guy's deader than rock music.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.913
Had a coronary the size of a Mack truck.

11:19.013 --> 11:21.849
Hey, listen, I will bet you a million

11:21.949 --> 11:25.119
that the walls are still
loaded with that cash.

11:25.219 --> 11:27.454
I mean, it might be worth taking a peek.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.857
- Well, I appreciate the heads up,

11:29.957 --> 11:31.725
but I just dropped 4 mil on this place.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.662
I don't think I'm knocking down any wall

11:33.761 --> 11:34.629
- 4 million?

11:34.728 --> 11:36.197
That's a steal,

11:36.297 --> 11:39.568
knowing that you could double
it with what's in there.

11:39.668 --> 11:40.502
- Okay.

11:40.602 --> 11:42.836
Okay. Well, I gotta get going.

11:42.937 --> 11:44.371
So, it was a pleasure.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.973
- Alright, son. See ya.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.708
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.009
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.478
You know, the local
watering hole is called the

11:51.580 --> 11:52.846
Lighthouse Inn.

11:52.947 --> 11:54.415
And if you really want to know the truth

11:54.516 --> 11:56.585
that's where I really live.

11:56.685 --> 11:58.118
So find me there

11:58.219 --> 12:01.789
and I'll find you a nice
bourbon with your name on it.

12:02.356 --> 12:03.857
You got it.

12:06.961 --> 12:10.431
- ♪ Oh, my pretty baby. ♪

12:10.532 --> 12:14.401
♪ Oh my sweetie, baby. ♪

12:14.502 --> 12:18.939
♪ I just can't believe I'm yours ♪

12:35.557 --> 12:36.524
- Hey Matt.

12:39.493 --> 12:40.427
- It's Rob.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.064
- Right. Sorry.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.067
- Oh, I was just um

12:47.167 --> 12:50.170
testing the acoustics of the room.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.476
- I have Janet on hold on line one.

12:55.577 --> 12:56.810
- Great. Put her through.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.412
- You just press one.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.814
You were out for three
weeks and already forgot

13:00.914 --> 13:02.283
how to use the phone?

13:06.120 --> 13:07.722
- This is Rob speaking.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.856
- Hey Rob. Welcome back.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.357
You sound better.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.893
- Well, it's great to be back
and I am feeling much better,

13:12.993 --> 13:14.261
Janet, let me tell you.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.797
- Good, because that was a
lot of time you took off.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.466
- Well, it's going to pay
you back tenfold, Janet.

13:19.567 --> 13:20.502
- Great to hear.

13:20.602 --> 13:22.737
Listen, I got to ask you something.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.038
- Shoot.

13:24.138 --> 13:26.708
- Where the fuck were you this morning?

13:26.807 --> 13:28.108
- Excuse me?

13:28.208 --> 13:30.311
- Tenfold? You missed
today's fucking meeting.

13:30.878 --> 13:33.947
- Oh, that was today. I'm sorry, Janet.

13:34.048 --> 13:35.316
I've just been so overwhelmed.

13:35.416 --> 13:36.884
- I don't want to hear
you took three weeks off

13:36.984 --> 13:37.851
to not be overwhelmed.

13:37.951 --> 13:38.952
You can't be doing this, Rob.

13:39.053 --> 13:39.920
- You're right, Janet.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.723
You're right. It won't happen again.

13:41.822 --> 13:42.657
I promise.

13:42.757 --> 13:43.957
- It better not happen again,

13:44.058 --> 13:45.159
because this waterfront
redevelopment is giving me

13:45.259 --> 13:46.193
a fucking ulcer.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.729
Everyone's working really hard.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.129
I need you plugged in.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.465
- Well, Janet, your electric
bill's about to skyrocket,

13:51.566 --> 13:55.135
because I am plugged in
and I am running hot.

13:56.370 --> 13:58.640
- Whatever. Listen, go
down to Jason's office.

13:58.740 --> 13:59.840
He'll fill you in.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.041
I need you to put your
heads together and poke

14:01.141 --> 14:02.677
as many holes as you can, okay?

14:02.777 --> 14:04.612
Your presentation needs to be ready to g

14:04.713 --> 14:06.681
first thing tomorrow morning.

14:06.781 --> 14:07.615
- Absolutely.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.517
- First thing tomorrow morning,

14:09.617 --> 14:13.588
you need to be in the conference
room, presentation in hand.

14:13.688 --> 14:14.488
- I'll be there, Janet.

14:14.589 --> 14:15.456
This will be the -

14:15.557 --> 14:17.424
Ahem.

14:17.525 --> 14:19.226
- Hi. Didn't see you there.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.697
- I have a Paulie Gatto on
hold. He says it's urgent.

14:22.797 --> 14:23.897
- Oh, shit.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.601
Ah, can you tell him
that I'm in a meeting?

14:27.468 --> 14:28.435
- Okay.

14:39.947 --> 14:40.682
- Yes?

14:40.782 --> 14:41.949
- Hi. Yes.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.651
Mr. Gatto says that he
insists that you step out

14:43.752 --> 14:44.686
of your fake meeting.

14:44.786 --> 14:46.987
- You told him it was a fake meeting?

14:47.087 --> 14:50.057
- No, I'm
telling you what he said.

14:50.157 --> 14:54.529
- Oh, well tell him that
it's a real meeting.

14:55.496 --> 14:56.463
- Sure.

15:10.978 --> 15:14.381
- Amanda, I told you to tell Paulie -

15:14.481 --> 15:15.449
- Hey Rob.

15:17.819 --> 15:19.119
Tell Paulie what?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.791
- To tell Paulie that my
meeting just finished.

15:22.891 --> 15:24.091
Hold all my calls.

15:24.191 --> 15:27.595
Paulie, you really shouldn't -
- Sit down.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.129
- Now, look, Rob.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.865
I'm not going to waste your time.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.299
Circumstances have changed.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.168
The boss wanted me to come
down and let you know that we

15:34.268 --> 15:37.070
need the money back by
the end of the week.

15:37.739 --> 15:38.773
- What?

15:38.873 --> 15:40.508
No, we had it.

15:40.608 --> 15:41.408
Big Sally-

15:41.509 --> 15:43.477
- Mrs. Salerno.

15:44.512 --> 15:45.647
- Huh?

15:45.747 --> 15:47.916
- Mrs. Salerno. She doesn't
like to be called Big Sally,

15:48.015 --> 15:51.385
finds it infantilizing and condescending

15:51.485 --> 15:53.855
- I'll make sure it doesn't happen again

15:53.954 --> 15:56.290
I was just saying, she
gave me the year and -

15:56.390 --> 15:59.928
- Yeah. Unfortunately
that's not gonna work.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.262
See the boss's daughter
just got accepted to the

16:02.362 --> 16:03.964
prestigious Paris Academy of Art.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.432
Problem is, it ain't cheap.

16:05.533 --> 16:10.103
Paris Academy of Art charges
$500,000 a semester.

16:10.204 --> 16:13.373
And we're the criminals.

16:14.676 --> 16:16.176
So long and short,

16:16.276 --> 16:19.714
boss needs 4 million for
four years of tuition,

16:19.814 --> 16:20.949
room and board.

16:21.048 --> 16:23.450
We go through the books,
and what do you know?

16:23.551 --> 16:25.620
We just gave you 4 million last week.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.622
So let's even things out.

16:27.722 --> 16:28.523
You give us some money back.

16:28.623 --> 16:31.024
We'll make it up to you in some other wa

16:31.124 --> 16:31.893
Want a drink?

16:31.992 --> 16:33.795
- No, I'm okay.

16:33.895 --> 16:38.600
- Oh, you should have one.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.635
So, how's that sound?

16:40.735 --> 16:43.070
- See, the thing is,

16:43.170 --> 16:44.839
I kinda spent the money.

16:44.939 --> 16:49.343
- Oh, I was really hoping you
weren't going to say that.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.378
On the other hand, your firm here,

16:51.478 --> 16:52.747
they're going to be
submitting the bid to be

16:52.847 --> 16:55.115
the lead contractor on the
waterfront redevelopment.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.585
- Oh, I don't know. See, I've been out.

16:57.685 --> 16:59.621
So I haven't really been
brought up to speed.

16:59.721 --> 17:00.889
- I'm bringing you up to speed.

17:00.989 --> 17:05.158
Salerno Construction LLC is
going to bid on those contracts

17:05.259 --> 17:08.462
and Salerno Construction
LLC will be awarded

17:08.563 --> 17:09.597
those contracts.

17:09.697 --> 17:11.566
Everything's supposed to
be finalized on Thursday.

17:11.666 --> 17:13.935
So either we get the
contracts on Thursday,

17:14.034 --> 17:16.203
or the 4 million on Friday.

17:16.771 --> 17:17.705
- I, I don't know.

17:17.805 --> 17:20.173
I don't have that kind
of firepower here, so-

17:20.274 --> 17:21.910
- Don't bullshit me, Rob!

17:22.010 --> 17:23.343
You'll figure it out,

17:23.443 --> 17:28.382
because if you don't, it actually
becomes much more simple.

17:28.482 --> 17:29.182
- Does it?

17:29.283 --> 17:30.652
- Yeah, because I'm gonna kill you.

17:30.752 --> 17:33.755
I'm gonna pull your fucking
teeth out of your mouth,

17:33.855 --> 17:35.723
slice you up in little tiny pieces,

17:35.823 --> 17:37.892
and when they finally
find your carcass floating

17:37.992 --> 17:39.192
in the fucking river,

17:39.293 --> 17:41.663
you'll be so disfigured,
they won't even be able

17:41.763 --> 17:43.598
to tell who you were.

17:43.698 --> 17:44.832
You got that?

17:46.266 --> 17:49.704
Who's she? Wife?

17:49.804 --> 17:50.772
- Girlfriend.

17:51.973 --> 17:54.943
- She's pretty.

17:55.543 --> 17:58.546
See you real soon, Rob.
Have a nice fucking day.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.317
- Hedge fund guy would scoop it up,

18:03.417 --> 18:05.319
but never in a million
years would I have thought

18:05.419 --> 18:06.854
it could have been you.

18:06.955 --> 18:09.591
You really proved me wrong, Rob.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.526
- Huh?

18:11.626 --> 18:14.862
- It pains me to admit it,
but I was wrong about you.

18:16.030 --> 18:19.867
And I apologize for everything I said.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.134
- Oh, it's okay.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.103
- No, it's not okay.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.238
The thought that I could
have driven you away

18:25.339 --> 18:28.843
from my daughter, oh, it eats me up.

18:28.943 --> 18:32.446
My wife says this is Roman marble. Bam!

18:33.014 --> 18:36.283
Sturdy, solid, outstanding.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.653
I'm damn proud of you, son.

18:39.621 --> 18:40.855
Damn proud.

18:40.955 --> 18:42.924
- Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

18:43.024 --> 18:44.626
- Julius, please.

18:45.927 --> 18:48.362
My daughter is in great hands.

18:48.462 --> 18:51.566
- Look at you two, hitting it off.

18:51.666 --> 18:52.900
- Honey,

18:53.001 --> 18:55.235
your man is a keeper.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.704
No doubt about it.

18:56.804 --> 18:57.739
- Dad.

18:57.839 --> 18:59.574
- Well, I'll leave you
two love birds to it.

18:59.674 --> 19:01.241
Why don't you help me find your mother?

19:01.341 --> 19:03.343
- Yeah, she couldn't
have kind of gone far.

19:03.443 --> 19:06.614
- Mona! We're leaving.

19:06.714 --> 19:09.751
- Looks like we had our first
successful dinner party.

19:09.851 --> 19:12.120
I'm going to go see them
out, but I just wanted to -

19:13.320 --> 19:14.555
- Oh my God.

19:19.326 --> 19:23.296
♪ You got my attention, baby ♪

19:23.397 --> 19:27.135
♪ And I can't make a move ♪

19:27.234 --> 19:31.371

19:45.452 --> 19:47.922
- Good morning, sweetheart.

19:48.022 --> 19:49.590
Are you feeling better?

19:49.691 --> 19:51.025
- Yeah. I'm great.

19:51.125 --> 19:53.895
I'm just gonna take a shower
and I'll be as good as new.

19:58.032 --> 19:59.433
- A little fog to start off our day.

19:59.534 --> 20:00.735
We may get some hints of sun yet.

20:00.835 --> 20:04.371
- There's my handsome
man, looking much better.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.540
- And now,
over to our local news.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.041
- I'm feeling much better, too.

20:07.141 --> 20:09.409
- In other news, three bodies
were found dismembered at the

20:09.510 --> 20:13.480
site of the upcoming Sandy
Shores waterfront redevelopment.

20:13.581 --> 20:14.716
WHIC News is on the scene,
bringing you the latest.

20:14.816 --> 20:16.517
- Isn't that the project
your firm is working on?

20:16.617 --> 20:17.952
- The police at the moment
are not saying anything,

20:18.052 --> 20:21.723
but with five more bodies
found and rumors they are tied

20:21.823 --> 20:22.957
to organized crime,

20:23.057 --> 20:26.094
residents worry that carnage
might just be the new normal

20:26.194 --> 20:27.360
in this waterfront community.

20:27.461 --> 20:29.564
While we don't know
much, one thing is clear,

20:29.664 --> 20:32.033
and that is that Rob
Smart is going to die.

20:32.133 --> 20:35.503
The only way out of this certain
and violent death is going

20:35.603 --> 20:38.338
to work and sabotaging that proposal,

20:38.438 --> 20:40.842
but the stress is on
because if Katie finds out,

20:40.942 --> 20:45.012
she is certain to leave him
and never talk to him again.

20:45.113 --> 20:46.313
With tensions running high,

20:46.413 --> 20:47.582
the police commissioner
will be releasing a formal

20:47.682 --> 20:49.349
statement later this afternoon.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.954
Until then, citizens are
urged to remain vigilant.

20:53.054 --> 20:54.989
Chuck Charles, WHIC News.

20:55.089 --> 20:57.491
- Rob, what's going on?

21:04.932 --> 21:06.333
- I can explain.

21:07.001 --> 21:08.503
- You're sick.

21:08.603 --> 21:09.537
Aw.

21:10.838 --> 21:11.806
- I'm sick?

21:13.040 --> 21:16.476
I'm sick. I'm sick.

21:17.111 --> 21:20.413
Oh, I'm so sorry, baby.

21:20.515 --> 21:21.883
Must've caught a stomach bug.

21:21.983 --> 21:23.851
- Of course. It's fine.

21:24.952 --> 21:28.055
Just take a sick day
and I'll take one too.

21:28.923 --> 21:30.357
- I'm going to kill you.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.727
- Oh no, actually,

21:33.293 --> 21:35.328
I got to go to work.

21:35.428 --> 21:39.801
- No. You don't. And I'm
canceling tonight's reservation.

21:39.901 --> 21:42.435
- Don't cancel the reservation.
It's our anniversary.

21:42.537 --> 21:46.874
And really, really I'm not sick.

21:46.974 --> 21:48.543
It was a one-time thing.

21:48.643 --> 21:50.443
- You threw up last night.

21:50.545 --> 21:52.947
- Who's keeping track? Two time thing.

21:53.047 --> 21:55.482
Really, I'm great.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.084
I just got to go to work and -

21:57.185 --> 21:59.854
- Rob. I'm not having this conversation.

21:59.954 --> 22:02.023
You're sick and if you're
not gonna take care

22:02.123 --> 22:03.524
of yourself, then I am.

22:03.624 --> 22:06.661
So stop being a workaholic,
get back into bed,

22:06.761 --> 22:09.197
and if I see you doing any work at all,

22:09.297 --> 22:11.766
you and I are going to have a big proble

22:12.300 --> 22:13.668
- I don't understand.

22:13.768 --> 22:15.102
You take one week off for a
death in the family, I get it,

22:15.203 --> 22:17.972
another week, because your
girlfriend took you on vacation

22:18.072 --> 22:19.574
to make you feel better, okay.

22:19.674 --> 22:23.077
And then another week to move
into a house you recently

22:23.177 --> 22:24.011
inherited.

22:24.111 --> 22:25.445
You promised that would be it.

22:25.546 --> 22:28.348
And now you come in late
on your first day back,

22:28.448 --> 22:30.318
you miss a meeting that we
scheduled to work around

22:30.417 --> 22:32.687
your schedule, and now
you're calling in sick?

22:32.787 --> 22:34.155
Are you fucking kidding me?

22:34.255 --> 22:35.488
- Janet, I'm sorry.

22:35.590 --> 22:36.958
I'm honestly feeling under the weather.

22:37.058 --> 22:39.060
- I don't care if you have
Ebola and you're bleeding

22:39.160 --> 22:40.427
out your face,

22:40.528 --> 22:42.563
I'm here with Jason and he
says you didn't even go to

22:42.663 --> 22:43.865
his office yesterday,

22:43.965 --> 22:45.833
so, what the fuck were
you doing for eight hours,

22:45.933 --> 22:47.367
playing solitaire?

22:47.467 --> 22:49.303
- I was so busy that day, Janet,

22:49.402 --> 22:50.705
it completely slipped past me.

22:50.805 --> 22:54.041
- I really tried to give you
an opportunity here, Rob.

22:54.141 --> 22:55.408
I really did.

22:55.509 --> 22:57.044
You know how important this
waterfront redevelopment

22:57.144 --> 22:57.979
plan is.

22:58.079 --> 22:59.213
- It is very important, Janet.

22:59.313 --> 23:00.248
It is very important.

23:00.348 --> 23:01.983
- It's very important, Rob.

23:02.083 --> 23:05.586
It's too important to be
messing this up, I'm sorry.

23:05.686 --> 23:07.722
You give me no choice. I
gonna have to let you go.

23:07.822 --> 23:10.725
- Janet. Please no, I have so many ideas

23:10.825 --> 23:12.660
They will, they will knock your socks of

23:12.760 --> 23:13.694
I promise.

23:13.794 --> 23:14.862
- Hm, well maybe if you
weren't such a fuck up,

23:14.962 --> 23:16.097
you'd have the opportunity
to express them.

23:16.197 --> 23:18.232
- Oh shit. Oh shit.

23:18.332 --> 23:20.467
Janet, please, I need this job.

23:20.568 --> 23:21.669
I need this job, Janet, please.

23:21.769 --> 23:23.271
I have worked my whole life for this.

23:23.371 --> 23:24.305
I have earned this.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.007
You know that I'm a kick-ass salesman.

23:26.107 --> 23:26.874
I slipped up. I'm sorry.

23:26.974 --> 23:28.776
You want me to break down crying again?

23:28.876 --> 23:30.878
You know how much I loved my uncle

23:30.978 --> 23:31.779
and now I'm sick.

23:31.879 --> 23:33.413
I've been vomiting all over the place.

23:33.514 --> 23:36.284
The carpets at the office
are gorgeous, Janet.

23:36.384 --> 23:37.484
You don't want me ruining them.

23:37.585 --> 23:40.922
- Honey? Are you working?

23:41.022 --> 23:42.356
- No. I'm not working.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.058
I'm just talking to some friends.

23:44.158 --> 23:45.126
- Who are you talking to?

23:45.226 --> 23:46.694
- Oh, it's um,

23:47.795 --> 23:48.362
Toby.

23:48.461 --> 23:50.463
- Oh, how's he doing?

23:50.564 --> 23:52.133
- He's great.

23:52.233 --> 23:53.301
- Hi Toby.

23:53.401 --> 23:54.735
When am I going to meet you already?

23:54.835 --> 23:58.105
I'm starting to think you're
avoiding me, you big flake!

23:59.941 --> 24:00.942
- He says, "Hi."

24:01.509 --> 24:03.044
Anyway, love you.

24:05.947 --> 24:06.747
- Wow.

24:06.847 --> 24:08.716
Well, I don't know what the fuck that wa

24:08.816 --> 24:11.484
but obviously your second
chance went out the window.

24:11.585 --> 24:13.955
So if you're not too overwhelmed,

24:14.055 --> 24:16.724
you can come into the
office at your leisure,

24:16.824 --> 24:18.559
pack up your things, and turn in your ke

24:18.659 --> 24:20.127
because you're fucking fired.

24:22.530 --> 24:24.098
- Oh, fuck.

24:36.210 --> 24:37.211
- Hey, neighbor.

24:39.213 --> 24:41.248
- Hey. Sydney, right?

24:41.349 --> 24:43.084
- Righto, brother.

24:44.151 --> 24:45.953
Get home from work early?

24:46.053 --> 24:48.189
- No, took a sick day.

24:48.289 --> 24:50.891
- Well, you don't look too sick to me.

24:50.992 --> 24:52.293
- Yeah.

24:52.393 --> 24:54.695
It's because I'm lying to you, Sydney.

24:55.529 --> 24:57.064
I was fired.

24:57.164 --> 24:59.600
And I told my girlfriend I
was going to the doctor, but

24:59.700 --> 25:02.870
I'm not, because I'm lying to her too.

25:02.970 --> 25:07.575
- Oh, brother. The
truth will set you free.

25:07.675 --> 25:09.677
And heck, if that fails,

25:09.777 --> 25:12.279
maybe a little bourbon might do the tric

25:12.380 --> 25:13.547
Hey, hey, hey, Jo Jo,

25:13.647 --> 25:15.449
two more, if you don't mind.

25:15.549 --> 25:19.153
Don't look so sad, son.
You'll get a new job.

25:19.253 --> 25:21.222
- It's not just the job.

25:21.322 --> 25:25.893
I owe a lot of money to
some really bad people.

25:27.595 --> 25:28.996
I don't know what to do.

25:29.096 --> 25:31.032
- If you're that hard pressed for cash.

25:31.132 --> 25:34.201
I'm telling you there's a
fortune hidden somewhere

25:34.301 --> 25:36.003
in that house of yours.

25:38.806 --> 25:39.907
- You were serious about that.

25:40.007 --> 25:40.841
- Darn serious.

25:40.941 --> 25:42.843
Look, your house is like an ocean

25:42.943 --> 25:45.279
and that money is lost at sea.

25:45.379 --> 25:46.714
All you have to do is look.

25:46.814 --> 25:49.583
- I'm not going to tear
apart my dream house

25:49.683 --> 25:51.185
on a wild goose chase.

25:51.285 --> 25:52.820
- Nay, nay, nay.

25:52.920 --> 25:56.724
If thy wits run the wild
goose chase, I have done,

25:56.824 --> 25:59.927
but thou hast more of the
wild goose in one of thy wits

26:00.027 --> 26:02.897
than I am sure I have in my whole five.

26:03.798 --> 26:06.734
It's there, kiddo. I'm sure of it.

26:06.834 --> 26:08.569
You just need to look.

26:10.438 --> 26:12.673
- Can I have another, please?

26:15.843 --> 26:20.214
- Now this one, the zuppa
di pesce alla veneziana,

26:20.314 --> 26:21.482
what's in that one?

26:21.582 --> 26:22.983
- Ah, yes.

26:23.084 --> 26:25.352
That is a choice assortment of
fish in a light tomato broth,

26:25.453 --> 26:26.454
highly recommended.

26:26.555 --> 26:28.422
However, since it is your first time her

26:28.523 --> 26:31.092
I do suggest you try the branzino,

26:31.192 --> 26:33.427
it is our award-winning house specialty,

26:33.528 --> 26:35.129
- The branzino?

26:35.229 --> 26:36.464
- Absolutely to die for.

26:38.399 --> 26:40.234
- Alright. That sounds great.

26:40.868 --> 26:42.303
- And your order, sir.

26:47.908 --> 26:51.078
- Oh, I'll have what she's having.

26:51.178 --> 26:54.415
- The branzino, excellent
choice. I can take your menus.

26:54.516 --> 26:56.784
- Honey. You're allergic to fish.

26:58.352 --> 27:00.054
- I am allergic to fish.

27:02.957 --> 27:04.992
- Would you like to
change your order, sir?

27:05.092 --> 27:09.930
- Oh, um, I will have the chicken.

27:11.699 --> 27:12.833
- As previously mentioned,

27:12.933 --> 27:15.236
we have two chicken options this evening

27:15.336 --> 27:16.670
We have a roasted chicken -

27:16.770 --> 27:18.405
- The roasted chicken's fine.

27:21.475 --> 27:23.644
- Very well. Your menus.

27:28.583 --> 27:29.884
- Honey, I,

27:29.984 --> 27:33.354
I want to talk about something
that's been on my mind.

27:33.454 --> 27:34.755
- Shoot.

27:34.855 --> 27:36.757
- I know you've had a big
week and maybe it's nothing,

27:36.857 --> 27:40.761
but I can't help but feel
that something is off.

27:40.861 --> 27:44.566
- Off? I don't think so.

27:44.665 --> 27:46.635
- It's just that since you met my parent

27:46.734 --> 27:48.202
and you had that
conversation with my dad -

27:48.302 --> 27:52.139
- I promise, everything's
good with your dad.

27:52.239 --> 27:54.008
Great guy, seriously.

27:54.108 --> 27:56.877
- Well, if there's anything
else that's going on,

27:56.977 --> 28:00.214
that's too much for you, you can tell me

28:00.314 --> 28:01.516
You know that, right?

28:01.616 --> 28:03.918
I love you and I want to be here for you

28:04.018 --> 28:05.853
in any way that I can be.

28:06.555 --> 28:09.723
- Katie, I want to tell you everything.

28:12.326 --> 28:13.327
And I already have.

28:15.930 --> 28:17.965
- Okay. I trust you.

28:21.202 --> 28:23.370
- I have to go to the bathroom real quic

28:23.470 --> 28:25.039
I'll be right back.

28:29.143 --> 28:31.845
Why didn't you tell her the truth, Rob?

28:31.946 --> 28:34.882
Because then she would leave you, asshol

28:35.617 --> 28:38.285
But you owe her the truth.

28:38.953 --> 28:41.255
You gotta tell her the truth, man.

28:46.561 --> 28:47.728
Okay.

28:48.729 --> 28:50.764
Let's do it.

28:51.666 --> 28:54.802
- Hey Rob, is there room for one more?

28:54.902 --> 28:57.404
What are the chances we end
up in the same restaurant

28:57.505 --> 28:58.839
on the same night?

28:58.939 --> 29:02.409
That's a rhetorical question,
Rob. The chances are high.

29:02.510 --> 29:04.745
This is Mrs. Salerno's place.

29:05.913 --> 29:08.449
- Mrs. Salerno owns this restaurant?

29:08.550 --> 29:11.218
- Mrs. Salerno owns this town.

29:11.318 --> 29:13.688
So, if could spare a moment of your time

29:13.821 --> 29:15.990
Mrs. Salerno is having dinner in the bac

29:16.090 --> 29:18.926
and it'd be quite rude of
you not to say, "Hello."

29:19.026 --> 29:23.397
- Oh, I really wouldn't want
to interrupt her dinner.

29:23.497 --> 29:25.933
- Please, Rob. I insist.

29:32.540 --> 29:35.309
Mrs. Salerno, you remember Rob?

29:35.409 --> 29:37.612
- Oh yeah. Oh wow, Rob.

29:37.712 --> 29:39.480
Oh, Robert, welcome.

29:39.581 --> 29:41.448
This is my daughter, Tori.

29:41.549 --> 29:43.384
Tori, say, "Hello" to Robert.

29:44.785 --> 29:46.086
- Can I be excused?

29:46.755 --> 29:48.122
- Of course.

29:48.922 --> 29:51.760
So now listen, Robert, how are you?

29:51.859 --> 29:53.628
Do you have the food here yet?

29:53.728 --> 29:55.530
- No, I just ordered.

29:55.630 --> 29:58.365
- Ah, everything here is delicious.

29:58.465 --> 29:59.466
What did you order?

29:59.567 --> 30:01.001
- I got the roasted chicken.

30:01.101 --> 30:03.003
- Oh, the roasted chicken is shit.

30:03.103 --> 30:05.339
He's going to have the branzino.

30:05.439 --> 30:09.577
You're going to love it.
I promise. I promise.

30:09.678 --> 30:13.847
You're going to eat every bite.

30:16.183 --> 30:20.954
Well, come on, sit down, take a load off

30:21.055 --> 30:24.158
So you know, we just
wanted to check in, yeah,

30:24.258 --> 30:27.494
take a moment of your time and make sure

30:28.162 --> 30:33.167
that we're all set for
tomorrow's delicate negotiations

30:33.267 --> 30:36.837
for the waterfront
redevelopment contracts.

30:39.006 --> 30:42.744
- We're on track. Everything's
as good as handled.

30:42.843 --> 30:46.280
- Oh, look at that. Aye, aye.

30:46.380 --> 30:48.583
Good as handled.

30:50.785 --> 30:52.486
- Oh, shit!

30:52.587 --> 30:56.691
- This was a test and you
failed because you're stupid.

30:56.791 --> 31:01.195
I have your balls in a vice
and you chose to lie to me.

31:01.295 --> 31:06.400
I know that you were fired
from your job this afternoon,

31:06.500 --> 31:07.836
because...

31:07.935 --> 31:12.906
I have ears, eyes everywhere, you fuck.

31:13.006 --> 31:14.942
You stupid motherfucker.

31:15.042 --> 31:17.579
So now the vice tightens.

31:20.515 --> 31:23.917
What is that sharp feeling you got there

31:24.017 --> 31:26.788
Motivation! That's what it is.

31:26.887 --> 31:28.790
- I was already motivated!

31:28.889 --> 31:31.291
- Yeah, well, a little more never hurt.

31:31.392 --> 31:33.894
- Maybe in your case it
does. Doesn't it, Rob?

31:33.994 --> 31:37.331
- You're going to get a
phone call in two days.

31:37.431 --> 31:38.767
You are not gonna want to miss that call

31:38.867 --> 31:43.070
and you're gonna want to have
my money when you answer.

31:43.937 --> 31:45.874
Great.

31:47.509 --> 31:48.710
- Oh, God.

31:48.810 --> 31:49.943
- Great.

31:51.813 --> 31:53.247
All right.

31:53.347 --> 31:54.516
Aaaah!

32:05.359 --> 32:07.629
- Hey, you were in there for awhile.

32:07.729 --> 32:09.363
Are you still feeling sick?

32:09.997 --> 32:11.331
- Really long line.

32:11.432 --> 32:14.034
- At the men's room? That's crazy.

32:14.134 --> 32:15.302
- The branzini.

32:15.936 --> 32:17.772
- Oh, there's been a mistake.

32:18.372 --> 32:20.708
- But this is compliments of Mrs. -

32:20.809 --> 32:21.776
- Oh,

32:21.876 --> 32:24.712
no, no, I wanted this.

32:24.813 --> 32:26.046
I really wanted to try it.

32:26.146 --> 32:28.716
- But you're violently allergic to fish.

32:28.817 --> 32:29.851
- I don't think that I am.

32:29.950 --> 32:31.653
I'm good. Trust me.

32:31.753 --> 32:32.953
- Enjoy your meal.

32:34.254 --> 32:35.422
- Look, look at this.

32:39.761 --> 32:40.728
Mmm.

32:41.796 --> 32:42.564
Mmm.

32:42.664 --> 32:46.033
See? I'm totally fine.

32:46.133 --> 32:49.470
- Well, the good news is the
anaphylaxis has responded

32:49.571 --> 32:53.140
to the medication and is
calming down quite a bit,

32:53.240 --> 32:56.778
but you really should not
be eating fish, Mr. Smart.

32:56.878 --> 32:57.779
I don't know if you know this,

32:57.879 --> 33:00.548
but you are deathly allergic to it.

33:00.648 --> 33:05.118
- He does know this. Rob,
what were you thinking?

33:05.820 --> 33:08.088
- Gotta live dangerously, sometimes.

33:08.188 --> 33:12.326
- In my professional
opinion, you should not.

33:12.961 --> 33:14.696
- Thank you, doctor.

33:14.796 --> 33:15.697
- You're welcome.

33:16.230 --> 33:20.234
I also looked at that
a dog bite on your leg

33:20.334 --> 33:24.506
and I must say it is highly irregular.

33:24.606 --> 33:25.740
- You got bit by a dog?

33:25.840 --> 33:28.643
- Dog bites usually present
as multiple puncture wounds,

33:28.743 --> 33:32.079
but this looked more like
someone stuck a steak knife

33:32.179 --> 33:34.481
in his leg and twisted it.

33:34.582 --> 33:38.018
- Yeah, Doc. That's
exactly what it felt like.

33:38.118 --> 33:41.188
That dog's teeth, they were sharp.

33:41.288 --> 33:44.291
- Like I said, unusual,

33:44.391 --> 33:46.594
but no matter. We cleaned it up.

33:46.694 --> 33:50.297
We gave you a rabies and
tetanus shot, antibiotics,

33:50.397 --> 33:54.201
CT, and MRI, with and
without contrast, the works.

33:54.301 --> 33:56.136
- Well, it's a good thing
your job has such great

33:56.236 --> 33:57.437
health insurance.

33:57.539 --> 33:59.139
I can't even imagine what
all of this would cost.

33:59.239 --> 34:00.508
- Yeah, big time.

34:00.608 --> 34:02.376
But if the insurance company is paying,

34:02.476 --> 34:05.613
why pinch pennies, right?

34:05.713 --> 34:08.616
It is your life on the line,

34:08.716 --> 34:10.117
but I'm sure you'll be fine.

34:10.217 --> 34:12.219
You'll be discharged in just a few days.

34:12.319 --> 34:16.691
- Oh no, Doc, I need to check out tonigh

34:18.993 --> 34:21.228
- I will let you two discuss.

34:22.597 --> 34:27.234
- Baby, I just want to go
home to our beautiful house.

34:27.334 --> 34:28.570
- You're not going anywhere.

34:28.670 --> 34:30.838
The doctor just said that you shouldn't

34:30.939 --> 34:32.574
- This is totally ridiculous.

34:32.674 --> 34:35.043
Look at me. I'm fine.

34:35.142 --> 34:36.744
- You don't look fine at all.

34:36.844 --> 34:38.312
You look like a pufferfish

34:38.412 --> 34:41.315
and you didn't tell me that a dog bit yo

34:41.415 --> 34:43.952
- I always look like a pufferfish.

34:44.052 --> 34:46.020
Let's just get out of here.

34:46.119 --> 34:49.724
- We're not going anywhere.
You could've died.

34:49.824 --> 34:50.925
- Okay.

34:51.025 --> 34:53.761
You want to stay? We'll stay.

35:25.994 --> 35:28.830
- Whoa, Nelly! What happened to you?

35:28.930 --> 35:30.230
- I know. It was an allergic reaction.

35:30.330 --> 35:32.066
But I need to talk to you

35:32.165 --> 35:33.735
about the money that's
hidden in the house.

35:33.835 --> 35:36.303
If you help me find it,
I'll give you a piece of it.

35:36.403 --> 35:38.006
- Oh, it's not necessary, friend.

35:38.106 --> 35:41.009
I have all the riches a man needs,

35:41.109 --> 35:43.044
but I appreciate the offer.

35:43.143 --> 35:44.879
Now, first order of business,

35:44.979 --> 35:46.948
I'd start by taking down those walls.

35:47.048 --> 35:48.382
- Any idea which rooms?

35:48.482 --> 35:51.552
- Oh, geez, the amount of sheet
rocking this guy was doing

35:51.653 --> 35:57.091
over the span of years, I
mean, best bet, all of them.

35:57.190 --> 35:59.226
This cat had a lot of cash.

35:59.326 --> 36:01.863
You better get yourself some tools.

36:02.830 --> 36:03.731
- Okay.

36:04.464 --> 36:09.604
Where am I supposed to get
tools at two in the morning?

36:19.279 --> 36:20.213
- Hey, excuse me.

36:20.313 --> 36:23.685
Any chance you know where the tool -

36:35.830 --> 36:36.631
Hey, excuse me.

36:36.731 --> 36:37.832
Any chance?

36:58.519 --> 36:59.921
- Hey, how's it going?

37:01.889 --> 37:03.390
- Benadryl's aisle two.

37:03.958 --> 37:05.126
- Thanks.

37:05.225 --> 37:08.462
Any chance, do you guys carry power tool

37:08.563 --> 37:09.564
- No.

37:09.664 --> 37:12.166
- Uh, do you know anywhere
I can get some tools?

37:12.265 --> 37:13.433
- Hardware store.

37:13.534 --> 37:14.602
- Are any open now?

37:14.702 --> 37:15.870
- No.

37:15.970 --> 37:19.774
- Look, you gotta have like
a sledgehammer or a power saw

37:19.874 --> 37:21.175
or something somewhere.

37:21.274 --> 37:23.611
- Um. This is a pharmacy.

37:28.616 --> 37:29.550
Please.

37:29.650 --> 37:32.452
You're the only place
that's open for miles.

37:33.688 --> 37:37.625
If I don't get my hand on
some tools, I'm gonna die.

37:58.146 --> 38:01.916
- My boss has some in the
back. I'll sell them to you.

38:02.016 --> 38:04.752
- Really? That'd be amazing.

38:04.852 --> 38:07.387
- All right. 500 bucks.

38:08.890 --> 38:10.258
- You got it.

38:10.357 --> 38:11.692
- Show me the money.

38:21.702 --> 38:22.804
- Oh shit.

38:24.772 --> 38:26.741
I don't have my wallet on me right now,

38:26.841 --> 38:30.945
but could you spot me and
I'll come back tomorrow.

38:31.045 --> 38:32.246
- No,

38:32.345 --> 38:35.650
- I know this is strange, but
please, this is an emergency.

38:41.088 --> 38:42.056
All right.

38:43.658 --> 38:46.459
You want to play this
game? I'll play this game.

38:46.561 --> 38:47.929
I want to speak to your manager.

38:48.029 --> 38:49.831
- I'm the manager.

38:49.931 --> 38:50.865
- Really?

38:50.965 --> 38:51.866
- Yeah.

38:52.700 --> 38:56.070
- Is there anything I can do
to get you to change your mind?

38:56.170 --> 38:57.437
- Yeah.

38:57.538 --> 39:00.541
Take your fucked up face
and leave my fucking store.

39:22.964 --> 39:27.101
- Hey guys, can I speak
to you for a second?

39:28.169 --> 39:30.571
- Look, man, look, I don't
know what you think you saw

39:30.671 --> 39:33.574
back there but we definitely
wasn't doing whippets.

39:33.674 --> 39:36.510
- Yeah.

39:36.611 --> 39:40.014
- I mean, it's medicinal
purposes for the both of us.

39:40.114 --> 39:41.148
We got cards.

39:41.916 --> 39:43.317
- I need your help.

39:43.416 --> 39:46.220
- Yo, what's wrong with your face?

39:46.320 --> 39:47.655
Benadryl is in aisle two.

39:47.755 --> 39:48.656
- I forgot my wallet and -

39:48.756 --> 39:50.625
- Let me stop you right there, G.

39:50.725 --> 39:52.026
We ain't got no cash.

39:52.126 --> 39:54.295
- Okay. I wasn't asking for any,

39:54.394 --> 39:56.163
but before I saw you shoplifting -

39:56.264 --> 39:58.933
- Whoa, that's mad accusatory, man.

39:59.499 --> 40:00.301
Let me stop you right there, chief.

40:00.400 --> 40:01.501
We ain't steal shit.

40:01.602 --> 40:03.337
- I just need you to
steal some tools from me

40:03.436 --> 40:04.238
that are in the back.

40:04.338 --> 40:05.539
- Yo, are you a cop?

40:06.107 --> 40:08.209
Are you trying to set us up?

40:08.309 --> 40:10.011
- No, I'm not a cop.

40:10.611 --> 40:13.080
- Prove it. Show us
you're not wearing a wire.

40:14.414 --> 40:16.150
- I'm not wearing a wire.

40:16.250 --> 40:18.786
- Oh? Yeah, you prove it, bitch.

40:27.261 --> 40:28.461
- Are you happy?

40:30.131 --> 40:31.799
- Drop your drawers.

40:35.870 --> 40:38.873
- What? Are you guys insane?

40:38.973 --> 40:41.208
- You could have a wire on your dick.

40:41.842 --> 40:45.046
Show us or we won't trust you.

40:45.146 --> 40:45.947
- Fuck you.

40:46.047 --> 40:49.850
You know, I don't have a wire on my dick

40:49.951 --> 40:52.219
- That sounds like exactly
what somebody with a wire

40:52.320 --> 40:53.788
on their dick would say.

40:54.487 --> 40:56.724
- Fine. Fine.

41:02.096 --> 41:03.130
- Trust me now?

41:04.765 --> 41:06.133
- It's a nice dick.

41:12.940 --> 41:15.409
- Yo, man. We just fucking with you.

41:15.509 --> 41:17.912
Cops don't wear wires on their dick.

41:18.779 --> 41:20.181
- Wave your dick.

41:20.281 --> 41:23.150
- He pulled his dick out.

41:23.250 --> 41:25.419
- In the middle of a
friggin' pharmacy

41:25.519 --> 41:26.320
- He pulled his dick out

41:26.420 --> 41:28.022
- In a pharmacy!

41:28.122 --> 41:29.056
- Whoa!

41:30.024 --> 41:33.461
Yo, yo. We gonna help
you, we gonna help you.

41:33.561 --> 41:34.996
Oh, shit!

41:35.096 --> 41:35.896
He pulled his dick out.

41:35.997 --> 41:38.265
Alright, look, I'm fucking with you, man

41:38.366 --> 41:39.266
Yeah, I'm Clyde. This is Brick.

41:39.367 --> 41:41.202
We get paid to steal shit quick.

41:41.836 --> 41:43.270
What's in it for us, B?

41:43.371 --> 41:46.674
- Steal the tools and then
we will go back to my place

41:46.774 --> 41:48.642
and I will pay you.

41:51.345 --> 41:52.847
- All right. Yeah. Go pull your car up.

41:52.947 --> 41:54.882
We'll be out in 10 minutes.

41:54.982 --> 41:57.918
I ain't gonna lie, this
house is fucking lit.

41:58.519 --> 41:59.820
- That's a nice painting.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.822
- I like the texture on the
background for the trees.

42:01.922 --> 42:03.991
- Yeah, that's Bob Ross shit.

42:04.759 --> 42:08.095
- Yo, not for nothing, yo,
this is a dope ass spot.

42:08.195 --> 42:12.633
- Yo, my cousin Marlon used
to rob hella places like this.

42:12.733 --> 42:13.834
- What happened to that dude?

42:13.934 --> 42:15.770
- He's doing 10 to 15 in Oswald.

42:15.870 --> 42:18.172
- Damn, B. Shit always
happens to the good ones.

42:18.272 --> 42:20.408
- No, you know, he made a lot
of great friends up there.

42:20.509 --> 42:21.342
- Oh word?

42:21.442 --> 42:22.243
- Yeah, he's doing really well.

42:22.343 --> 42:23.110
- Oh, shit.

42:23.210 --> 42:24.045
- He's got a social scene.

42:24.145 --> 42:25.446
- Hey guys.

42:26.113 --> 42:29.950
You said your names were
Clyde and Brick, right?

42:31.619 --> 42:34.155
Which one of you should
I write the check to?

42:37.058 --> 42:39.693
Okay. I will just make it to cash.

42:39.794 --> 42:41.095
How does 200 sound?

42:41.195 --> 42:45.433
- Mm. Yeah. We was thinking
10,000 sounds about right.

42:45.534 --> 42:46.434
- Os.

42:46.535 --> 42:47.802
- Yeah.
- $10,000?

42:47.902 --> 42:48.537
- Yeah.

42:48.636 --> 42:49.470
- Are you guys nuts?

42:49.570 --> 42:50.438
I don't have that kind of money.

42:50.539 --> 42:51.772
Honestly, I don't have any money.

42:51.872 --> 42:54.408
- Yeah, because I could
see you slumming it in this

42:54.509 --> 42:56.243
Taj Mahal looking motherfucker, right?

42:56.343 --> 42:57.778
Hey, quit the bullshit, man!

42:57.878 --> 42:59.413
We know you got it. You loaded.

42:59.514 --> 43:01.115
- Guys. It's really not like that.

43:01.215 --> 43:04.819
You think I want to destroy
my house for the fun of it?

43:04.919 --> 43:08.422
- What are you up to? Huh?

43:14.862 --> 43:15.830
Yo.

43:17.498 --> 43:19.033
He's hiding shit in the walls.

43:19.133 --> 43:20.301
- Mmm.

43:20.401 --> 43:21.202
- No, I'm not.

43:22.803 --> 43:24.472
Yo, he's hiding stuff.

43:24.573 --> 43:25.406
- I didn't even think of that.

43:25.507 --> 43:26.474
- In the walls.

43:26.575 --> 43:28.976
- I didn't even think of that.

43:29.076 --> 43:30.377
- This wall?

43:30.478 --> 43:31.445
- There's nothing in the walls.

43:31.546 --> 43:32.514
- There's something in the walls.

43:32.613 --> 43:33.848
- I'm not hiding anything in the walls.

43:33.948 --> 43:39.320
- I know it's in the walls. (sniffs wall

43:40.955 --> 43:43.357
- There are drugs in the walls.

43:45.025 --> 43:46.861
- These walls are not filled with drugs.

43:46.961 --> 43:47.761
- Yeah.

43:47.862 --> 43:48.863
- Do you know how much yayo is probably

43:48.963 --> 43:50.865
Yo, we could probably be like Tony Monta

43:50.965 --> 43:51.799
in this motherfucker, yo.

43:51.899 --> 43:54.068
- Say hello to my little friend.

43:54.168 --> 43:55.169
- Hey, hey, hey!

43:55.269 --> 43:56.538
I'm going to call the cops
if you guys don't leave

43:56.637 --> 43:57.972
right now.

43:58.072 --> 44:01.108
So how about I finish writing
this check and we can just

44:01.208 --> 44:02.776
be on our -

44:17.691 --> 44:20.761
Hey, hey! Stop, please! Please!

44:20.861 --> 44:22.564
Please don't do this!

44:26.601 --> 44:27.768
- Did you?

44:28.603 --> 44:29.604
Did you hear something?

44:29.703 --> 44:30.505
- No, I did not.

44:30.605 --> 44:31.839
- Did you understand that?

44:31.939 --> 44:33.307
- No. It was in snitch. I
don't understand snitch.

44:33.407 --> 44:36.377
- Ooh. Yeah. We don't have no
Rosetta Stone for that shit.

44:36.477 --> 44:37.845
- Guys, please.

44:37.945 --> 44:39.648
- And we trusted you, dog. We
went out on a limb for you.

44:39.747 --> 44:42.183
This is how you repay us? Hm?

44:42.283 --> 44:47.021
Calling the cops on us and
holding the drugs out from us?

44:47.121 --> 44:48.355
Where your loyalty at, man?

44:48.455 --> 44:51.058
- I promise you. There
are no drugs hidden here.

44:51.158 --> 44:54.795
- Oh yeah. I'll put a hole in this wall.

44:54.895 --> 44:56.330
What am I gonna find?

44:56.430 --> 44:57.831
- Millions of dollars in cash.

45:01.268 --> 45:02.069
- You for real?

45:02.169 --> 45:03.204
- Yes.

45:03.304 --> 45:05.472
Supposedly, there's a
fortune hidden in the house

45:05.574 --> 45:10.044
and if I don't find it, Big
Sally's going to kill me.

45:10.612 --> 45:13.047
- Wait. No, no, no, no, no, no.

45:14.014 --> 45:15.584
You talking about Big Sally?

45:16.585 --> 45:17.552
No. Hell no.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.120
I don't do Big Sally.

45:20.221 --> 45:23.490
- I have to pay her $4 million by Friday

45:23.592 --> 45:25.192
But, according to my neighbor,

45:25.292 --> 45:28.162
there's at least double
that, hidden in the walls.

45:28.262 --> 45:32.066
- Clyde, may I sidebar
with you for a moment?

45:32.166 --> 45:32.800
- Absolutely.

45:32.900 --> 45:34.435
- Okay.
- Give us a second.

45:41.442 --> 45:43.010
- I want a mansion,
I want a fucking house.

45:43.110 --> 45:45.680
I want a pool. I want
a pool. I want a pool.

45:45.779 --> 45:47.915
I want a pool. I want
a pool so fucking bad.

45:52.621 --> 45:54.221
- We talked about it.

45:54.922 --> 45:56.490
We gonna help you, under one condition.

45:56.591 --> 46:01.563
You can't say shit about
me and Brick helping you.

46:01.663 --> 46:04.064
Not to Big Sally, not to your mama,

46:04.164 --> 46:06.333
not to your grand mama's mama.

46:06.433 --> 46:07.134
Nobody.

46:07.234 --> 46:09.537
You can take enough to pay Big Sally

46:09.638 --> 46:11.539
and we gonna keep the rest.

46:11.640 --> 46:13.974
- Absolutely. I think that's very fair.

46:14.709 --> 46:15.876
- Alright.

46:20.682 --> 46:23.851
Now, look, I'm going to untie you.

46:23.951 --> 46:25.185
Don't you attack me, alright?

46:25.286 --> 46:28.188
All that shit, tying you
up, hitting you in the head,

46:28.289 --> 46:29.758
"Fog of War" shit.

46:29.890 --> 46:31.559
I was, I was in the moment.

46:31.660 --> 46:32.560
- It's fine.
- Okay.

46:32.661 --> 46:33.628
- It's fine.

46:34.194 --> 46:36.030
- I was in ROTC program, bro.

46:36.130 --> 46:38.065
- It's cool. All is forgiven.

46:41.268 --> 46:42.671
- Yippee ki yay, motherfuckers!

46:42.771 --> 46:46.807
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait!

46:46.907 --> 46:51.879
- Yo, I am trying to get started.

46:51.979 --> 46:56.584
- Maybe we can do it without
destroying the house.

46:56.685 --> 46:59.654
In fact, we can't damage the house.

46:59.754 --> 47:01.388
It needs to be pristine.

47:01.488 --> 47:04.592
- Why did we get the tools,
if it's gotta be pristine?

47:04.693 --> 47:05.527
Yo, you want this money or not, man,

47:05.627 --> 47:07.394
cause you fucking around.

47:07.928 --> 47:09.129
- I need the money,

47:09.229 --> 47:13.367
but we gotta find it
without damaging the house.

47:13.467 --> 47:17.871
- So you want us to do
demolition work, neat?

47:17.971 --> 47:21.275
- No, no, no demolition work. Pristine.

47:21.375 --> 47:23.977
- This is some stupid fucking shit.

47:24.912 --> 47:27.114
- Good morning, beautiful.

47:27.214 --> 47:30.618
Got you breakfast, eggs
Benedict, fresh croissant,

47:30.719 --> 47:33.387
and a black passion tea lemonade.

47:33.487 --> 47:34.589
- Rob.

47:34.689 --> 47:36.924
- It's okay. I woke up feeling great.

47:37.024 --> 47:39.761
I'm sorry. How's my face looking?

47:39.860 --> 47:41.663
- Your face does look better.

47:41.763 --> 47:43.130
- See?

47:43.230 --> 47:44.932
I was even able to run home
and get you a change of clothes

47:45.032 --> 47:46.668
so you don't have to
rush back to the house.

47:46.768 --> 47:48.001
- Did the doctor sign off on this?

47:48.102 --> 47:49.403
- It was her idea.

47:49.504 --> 47:51.872
So how about you take a fancy shower her

47:51.972 --> 47:53.608
I brought you everything that you need

47:53.708 --> 47:55.876
and then I'll drive you to
the train so we can get back

47:55.976 --> 48:00.548
to work and have a boring old workday.

48:02.082 --> 48:03.917
What the fuck?

48:07.454 --> 48:08.422
What the fuck?

48:08.523 --> 48:12.059
Hey, hey, guys? Guys?

48:12.159 --> 48:15.496
you seriously took old
antibiotics and flu medicine?

48:17.030 --> 48:19.868
- Yo, those drugs are fucking me up.

48:19.967 --> 48:20.869
- Mmm hmm.

48:20.968 --> 48:23.003
- Oh my God. Did you find the money?

48:23.103 --> 48:25.439
- Yo, we was getting ready
to start figuring things out,

48:25.540 --> 48:28.610
and then, you know, I-I
guess the drugs kicked in.

48:29.209 --> 48:30.578
- So you did nothing?

48:31.813 --> 48:33.147
- We did drugs.

48:33.247 --> 48:36.718
- Bro, you try looking in
the wall without breaking it.

48:36.818 --> 48:37.985
It can't be done.

48:38.787 --> 48:41.021
- I am going to run out of time.

48:41.121 --> 48:44.425
- Look, unless you rethink
this whole pristine thing,

48:44.526 --> 48:45.593
it ain't gonna happen.

48:45.693 --> 48:48.429
- Yo, man, we'll be super careful.

48:48.530 --> 48:50.899
And we'll only knock out the
things we have to knock out.

48:50.998 --> 48:52.132
Okay?

48:52.232 --> 48:53.535
We'll be very...we won't
do a bunch of damage.

48:53.635 --> 48:56.003
- Yeah, we'll do it real
conservatively, yo. Like for real.

48:56.103 --> 48:58.405
And we'll break a little
piece, a little piece,

48:58.506 --> 49:00.374
that way, it's easy to patch up later.

49:00.474 --> 49:01.843
- Word.

49:01.942 --> 49:04.579
- Okay, please just do it.

49:05.112 --> 49:07.582
Whatever you need to do, just do it.

49:07.682 --> 49:08.583
I got to get going.

49:08.683 --> 49:10.951
- Wait, wait, where the
fuck you off to now?

49:13.287 --> 49:14.656
- I am going to call my
girlfriend and tell her

49:14.756 --> 49:17.057
that there's a serious and
dangerous gas leak in the house.

49:17.157 --> 49:18.593
Then, I'm gonna book us
a really nice hotel room,

49:18.693 --> 49:21.228
tell her the gas company's
paying for it indefinitely.

49:21.328 --> 49:23.363
Then, and hopefully relatively soon,

49:23.464 --> 49:24.599
you're going to call
me and tell me that you

49:24.699 --> 49:26.400
found the money, so I
can pay Big Sally back,

49:26.500 --> 49:27.968
hire a contractor to fix the place,

49:28.068 --> 49:29.871
and then take Katie on a
lovely vacation to Thailand,

49:29.970 --> 49:31.138
so that the time that we get back,

49:31.238 --> 49:33.708
she'll never know that anything was wron

49:34.742 --> 49:36.176
- That is some pathological shit.

49:36.276 --> 49:38.278
- Yeah, you a fucked up
indivisible for that, yo.

49:38.378 --> 49:42.416
- Guys, please, I am
holding on for dear life.

49:43.217 --> 49:46.119
Please just find the fucking money.

50:11.211 --> 50:12.312
- Is it done?

50:12.412 --> 50:14.983
- Yeah, man,
we're done. Every room.

50:15.082 --> 50:16.951
- I could kiss you on the lips.

50:17.050 --> 50:18.051
How much was there?

50:18.151 --> 50:19.854
- You're gonna want to come here

50:40.975 --> 50:42.476
- Gimme.

50:48.348 --> 50:51.318
- You destroyed my house!

50:53.487 --> 50:56.991
- You're at a 10, I
need you at 6. Alright?

50:57.124 --> 50:58.191
Now you gotta understand,

50:58.292 --> 51:00.528
we wasn't gonna find
this money any other way

51:00.628 --> 51:03.330
and you was going to be dead
if we didn't find it, right?

51:03.430 --> 51:06.466
You know, so, what's a house
if you can't live in it?

51:06.568 --> 51:07.167
- A coffin, yo.

51:07.267 --> 51:08.335
- Word. A coffin.

51:08.435 --> 51:11.138
A coffin with high property tax

51:11.238 --> 51:13.173
in a fly ass school district.

51:13.273 --> 51:15.710
- You said you were going
to do it conservatively.

51:15.810 --> 51:17.645
- Yo, conservatively
wasn't working for you.

51:17.745 --> 51:19.714
- Well you see, like on paper,
like conservatively sounds

51:19.814 --> 51:23.083
real good, but in like
practical practicality practice,

51:23.183 --> 51:25.085
it was real impractical, my G.

51:27.789 --> 51:28.890
- So what'd you find?

51:28.990 --> 51:30.190
- Well, we found that there
are some structural issues

51:30.290 --> 51:31.358
in the bedroom.

51:31.458 --> 51:32.492
- Yes.

51:32.594 --> 51:33.493
- And some termites between
the dining room and the

51:33.595 --> 51:34.696
kitchen.

51:34.796 --> 51:35.863
Now if you get that shit
inspected in the next 10 years,

51:35.964 --> 51:36.898
get those termites out of there,

51:36.998 --> 51:37.765
you gonna have a really nice house.

51:37.865 --> 51:38.866
It's got great bones.

51:38.967 --> 51:40.267
You just got to fix up all these walls,

51:40.367 --> 51:41.869
you're gonna have wonderful place to liv

51:41.970 --> 51:42.870
- Mmm hmm.

51:42.971 --> 51:45.707
- The money! Did you find the money?

51:47.775 --> 51:48.743
- No.

51:50.645 --> 51:53.146
- All of this and you found nothing?

51:53.246 --> 51:54.983
- No, we found out about
the structural problems

51:55.083 --> 51:55.883
in the bedroom.

51:55.984 --> 51:57.217
- Yes.

51:57.317 --> 51:57.986
- We found out about the
termites between the kitchen

51:58.086 --> 51:59.286
and the dining room.

51:59.386 --> 52:00.755
I don't know
who inspected this place,

52:00.855 --> 52:02.056
but they must've been smoking
a lot of crack because man,

52:02.155 --> 52:03.691
I'm just a guy, I don't know shit,

52:03.791 --> 52:05.560
but I can tell you that
and I can tell you that.

52:05.660 --> 52:07.829
And I can also tell you you
should have the beams checked,

52:07.929 --> 52:08.730
cause they're kind of wobbly.

52:08.830 --> 52:10.497
- Yeah, creaks a lot.

52:11.799 --> 52:13.333
- I am dead!

52:13.433 --> 52:16.269
I am completely dead!

52:16.370 --> 52:19.272
You guys fucked me! Both of you!

52:19.373 --> 52:22.944
You destroyed my house for nothing!

52:23.911 --> 52:27.048
I bet you did find it.
I bet you two robbed me.

52:27.147 --> 52:28.181
- Okay, now I'm going
to stop you right there.

52:28.281 --> 52:30.183
We ain't steal shit, man.

52:30.283 --> 52:31.953
Yo, there wasn't shit in this house.

52:32.053 --> 52:33.420
Shit, if you don't believe me,

52:33.521 --> 52:34.856
watch my life for the next 10
years to see if the quality

52:34.956 --> 52:37.659
of my life improves or see
if my spending habits change.

52:37.759 --> 52:39.060
- Yo, you would never find me that way,

52:39.159 --> 52:41.696
cause I got like mad,
modest habits, right?

52:41.796 --> 52:44.932
I take the bus, I go to
Taco Tuesdays, but yo,

52:45.033 --> 52:45.900
we didn't find any money.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.267
- No, we didn't find nothing.

52:47.367 --> 52:48.870
Yo, and look, I know we had
a deal to keep the rest,

52:48.970 --> 52:51.304
but like yo, there ain't no rest, B.

52:51.405 --> 52:53.741
So, uh, yo, we was thinking like,

52:53.841 --> 52:55.743
you still break us off with
the 10 Gs for like, you know,

52:55.843 --> 52:57.945
stealing the tools and
the work we did and shit.

52:58.046 --> 52:59.047
- That's not happening.

52:59.147 --> 53:00.447
- Yo, come on, man. All that work we did

53:00.548 --> 53:05.720
- Yeah, and you failed. Your
job was to find the money.

53:06.120 --> 53:08.156
And you did not find the money.

53:08.255 --> 53:10.357
So what the fuck am I
going to pay you for?

53:10.457 --> 53:13.728
- Dawg? We took apart
every inch of this place.

53:13.828 --> 53:14.896
- Every inch.

53:14.996 --> 53:18.833
- The money's not here. So
your issue isn't with us.

53:18.933 --> 53:21.736
It's with whoever the
fuck lied to you about it.

53:21.836 --> 53:25.873
So why don't you slow your
roll and take it up with them?

53:37.484 --> 53:41.756
- Hi. Ma'am, I'm really sorry
to bother you at this hour.

53:41.856 --> 53:43.524
- Is everything all right?

53:43.624 --> 53:45.425
Are you with the fire department?

53:45.526 --> 53:49.396
- No. No. I'm Rob, your new
neighbor from next door.

53:49.496 --> 53:52.133
- Oh, you're new neighbor.

53:52.232 --> 53:54.635
I was going to bake you a casserole.

53:57.437 --> 54:00.041
Why are you making all that racket?

54:00.141 --> 54:02.176
It's the middle of the night.

54:02.275 --> 54:03.611
- Yeah, I'm really sorry about that.

54:03.711 --> 54:06.547
And that's actually why I'm here.

54:06.647 --> 54:09.117
I really need to speak with your husband

54:09.650 --> 54:12.486
- He finally just got to sleep.

54:12.587 --> 54:14.989
You're lucky we didn't call the police.

54:15.089 --> 54:16.858
You better come back in the morning.

54:16.958 --> 54:18.458
- Ma'am, ma'am.

54:18.559 --> 54:21.461
I'm sorry, but I'm not
taking no for an answer.

54:21.562 --> 54:23.131
Your husband put me up to this

54:23.231 --> 54:26.134
and I'm not leaving
without talking to him.

54:26.234 --> 54:28.803
- He's always up to something, isn't he?

54:29.704 --> 54:31.038
I'll go get him.

54:39.247 --> 54:41.516
- Who the fuck are you?

54:42.216 --> 54:43.383
- Um,

54:45.019 --> 54:46.821
is Sydney home?

54:46.921 --> 54:48.990
I'm looking for Sydney.

54:49.090 --> 54:50.892
- No, there's no Sydney here.

54:50.992 --> 54:53.694
I'm Dick. Margie's my wife.

54:53.795 --> 54:54.796
What do you want?

54:55.495 --> 54:59.167
- There's no Sydney? Are you sure?

54:59.267 --> 55:00.568
- Son, I've been living here for 45 year

55:00.668 --> 55:03.237
If there was a Sydney, I'd know.

55:03.336 --> 55:04.605
- I'm so sorry.

55:04.705 --> 55:06.874
I must have gotten the wrong house.

55:07.742 --> 55:08.943
Do you know which one's his?

55:09.043 --> 55:10.745
- I'm telling you kid,
there's no Sydney's in the

55:10.845 --> 55:11.746
neighborhood.

55:11.846 --> 55:14.182
- There has to be. There
has to be a Sydney.

55:14.282 --> 55:16.651
- You want a Sydney, you fly to Australi

55:16.751 --> 55:18.986
Everybody on the street has
lived here for at least the past

55:19.086 --> 55:21.454
five years or so, except you.

55:21.556 --> 55:25.593
Unless your name is Sydney,
then there are no Sydney's here.

55:25.693 --> 55:28.796
Now, it's 3 o'clock in the
morning and I got to go to work.

55:29.496 --> 55:32.465
Oh, and if you turn on that
saw again, one more time,

55:32.567 --> 55:34.869
I'll fucking kill you with it!

55:49.550 --> 55:51.919
♪ Hellfire ♪

55:52.019 --> 55:53.486
♪ Hellfire ♪

55:53.588 --> 55:58.659
♪ Hellfire, that's where I'm bound ♪

55:58.759 --> 56:01.428
- Rob, me boy, how are we?

56:03.965 --> 56:05.132
- Confused.

56:05.233 --> 56:07.201
- Confused? How?

56:07.301 --> 56:09.637
- Well, we gutted and destroyed my house

56:09.737 --> 56:11.806
The house, I might add,
I did everything for

56:11.906 --> 56:13.040
in the first place.

56:13.140 --> 56:17.044
And wouldn't you know
it? There was no money.

56:17.144 --> 56:19.379
- That's peculiar.

56:20.014 --> 56:23.150
- And then I went to
your house to tell you,

56:23.251 --> 56:28.522
only you weren't there,
because you don't live there.

56:28.623 --> 56:31.726
Apparently, you're not my neighbor.

56:31.826 --> 56:35.462
- No, now son, that's not
true. We're all neighbors.

56:35.563 --> 56:38.032
- None of what you told me is true, is i

56:39.300 --> 56:40.868
Why would you do that to me?

56:40.968 --> 56:44.572
Everything I've been through,
has been for that house.

56:44.672 --> 56:47.608
And now the house is
destroyed, because of you!

56:47.708 --> 56:51.679
- No, you destroyed
the house, Rob, not I.

56:51.779 --> 56:55.249
I'm the audience, I'm here to watch.

56:55.349 --> 56:57.618
I was hope and now hope is lost.

56:57.718 --> 57:01.689
And now your life will be torn
asunder by your thoughtless

57:01.789 --> 57:03.991
grabbing beyond your means

57:04.091 --> 57:09.196
and your endless, endless,
endless trail of deceit!

57:09.297 --> 57:14.969
No, your lies and your
shortcuts were your undoing.

57:15.269 --> 57:17.338
Not I.

57:17.437 --> 57:19.740
- You want a piece of me, old man?

57:22.376 --> 57:25.746
" 'Twas brillig and the slithy toves

57:25.846 --> 57:29.684
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe

57:29.784 --> 57:32.119
All mimsy were the borogoves

57:32.219 --> 57:36.257
And the mome raths outgrabe.

57:36.357 --> 57:38.759
Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

57:38.859 --> 57:42.129
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch

57:42.229 --> 57:45.132
'Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun,

57:45.232 --> 57:47.535
The frumious Bandersnatch!'

57:47.635 --> 57:50.304
And as in uffish thought he stood,

57:50.404 --> 57:52.940
The Jabberwock with eyes of flame

57:53.040 --> 57:57.111
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood

57:57.211 --> 57:58.946
and burbled as it came.

57:59.046 --> 58:02.316
One, two! One, two! Through and through

58:02.416 --> 58:05.453
The vorpal blade did sniker-snack!

58:05.553 --> 58:08.189
He left it dead, and with his head

58:08.289 --> 58:09.190
He went galumphing-

58:09.290 --> 58:12.560
- Aaaah!

58:22.903 --> 58:26.107
I think I should have a lawyer.

58:26.207 --> 58:27.708
- No, no, no, no, no.

58:27.808 --> 58:30.311
You assaulted a homeless mental patient.

58:30.411 --> 58:31.245
- What?

58:31.345 --> 58:32.980
No, he said he was my neighbor--

58:33.080 --> 58:35.216
- Yeah, we know.

58:35.316 --> 58:36.617
- He has a lot of those.

58:36.717 --> 58:37.852
You know, one of his personalities,

58:37.952 --> 58:39.286
he thinks he's John Lennon.

58:39.387 --> 58:43.190
- Not a John Lennon impersonator,
but actually John Lennon.

58:43.290 --> 58:44.658
- Gotta admire a guy that nuts.

58:44.759 --> 58:47.194
We spoke to our eccentric
friend and believe it or not,

58:47.294 --> 58:49.263
he doesn't have to press charges.

58:49.363 --> 58:51.399
- Doesn't have to, but could.

58:51.499 --> 58:53.834
- Depends on what we ask him to do.

58:53.934 --> 58:56.537
Big Sally is a clever operator

58:56.637 --> 58:58.372
and we haven't been able to touch her.

58:58.472 --> 59:00.541
- You ever hear of a rat, Rob?

59:01.075 --> 59:04.078
Not vermin, like your
new drug addled friends,

59:04.178 --> 59:05.179
Clyde and Brick,

59:05.279 --> 59:08.883
but a more traditional
"wearing-a-wire" type rat.

59:08.983 --> 59:10.551
- You want me to wear a wire?

59:10.651 --> 59:13.554
- Well, it's not wire nowadays.

59:13.654 --> 59:16.090
Technology has advanced so much.

59:16.624 --> 59:19.326
We just install an app
on your phone and boom,

59:19.427 --> 59:21.462
we hear everything.

59:21.562 --> 59:23.164
- Incredible, right?

59:23.798 --> 59:26.167
- We'll also give you full immunity, too

59:26.267 --> 59:28.135
- Full immunity,
Rob, say whatever you want.

59:28.235 --> 59:30.871
- As long as Big Sally's
implicated in a major criminal

59:30.971 --> 59:34.008
activity in front of you,
we don't care what you say.

59:34.108 --> 59:34.909
- Or what you do.

59:35.009 --> 59:35.976
- Kill somebody.

59:36.077 --> 59:36.811
- Steal things.

59:36.911 --> 59:38.513
- Maybe some tools at the BargainMart.

59:38.612 --> 59:39.680
- Or you can pull your dick out.

59:39.780 --> 59:41.248
- It's all kosher.

59:41.348 --> 59:42.116
- We got your back.

59:42.216 --> 59:43.050
- Meaning the government.

59:43.150 --> 59:45.486
- And it's all contingent on your abilit

59:45.586 --> 59:47.688
to capture Big Sally in the commission

59:47.788 --> 59:50.324
of a preferably violent crime.

59:50.891 --> 59:55.496
- So, what do you say, Rob?
Want to help your country?

59:56.263 --> 59:58.599
- You know, I think before
he helps his country,

59:58.699 --> 1:00:01.602
he ought to get back to
his girlfriend, don't you?

1:00:01.702 --> 1:00:03.804
- Oh, that's right.

1:00:03.904 --> 1:00:06.640
You left her in the city, at a hotel.

1:00:06.740 --> 1:00:08.075
- Mm, he sooner he gets out of here,

1:00:08.175 --> 1:00:11.779
the sooner he can get back
to spinning that web of lies.

1:00:13.681 --> 1:00:16.817
- Hey, baby! You up?

1:00:16.917 --> 1:00:20.955
I tried calling and your
phone kept going to voicemail,

1:00:21.055 --> 1:00:21.989
and-

1:00:23.791 --> 1:00:25.793
- Oh, shit.

1:00:30.297 --> 1:00:34.902
Hey, I got us breakfast.
Hope you're hungry.

1:00:37.271 --> 1:00:39.673
Gotta say, I don't like the
way you're looking at me

1:00:39.773 --> 1:00:40.941
right now.

1:00:45.412 --> 1:00:47.448
What was that for?

1:00:47.549 --> 1:00:48.682
- Yeah?

1:00:51.785 --> 1:00:52.953
- Jesus, Katie!

1:00:54.488 --> 1:00:57.091
Okay, all right.

1:00:58.159 --> 1:00:58.726
I can explain.

1:00:58.826 --> 1:01:00.961
- No, it's my turn to talk

1:01:01.061 --> 1:01:02.897
about how I woke up in a hotel room

1:01:02.997 --> 1:01:04.265
and my boyfriend was gone.

1:01:04.365 --> 1:01:07.334
And how, after I tried to
call you a thousand times,

1:01:07.434 --> 1:01:10.237
I went down to the front desk
and they told me you left

1:01:10.337 --> 1:01:11.640
in the middle of the night.

1:01:11.739 --> 1:01:13.608
And then when I panicked
and called the police

1:01:13.707 --> 1:01:15.109
to report you were missing,

1:01:15.209 --> 1:01:17.011
they told me they didn't even need to lo

1:01:17.111 --> 1:01:21.516
because you were in custody
for assaulting an old man.

1:01:21.616 --> 1:01:22.783
- He's not going to press charges--

1:01:22.883 --> 1:01:24.351
- No I'm talking.

1:01:24.451 --> 1:01:27.221
So then I called your job

1:01:27.321 --> 1:01:29.823
to let them know you were
gonna miss another day of work.

1:01:29.924 --> 1:01:32.259
And they told me you got fired.

1:01:32.359 --> 1:01:34.795
And then I had my dad go
check on the gas leak.

1:01:34.895 --> 1:01:36.830
And not only did he
tell me that was a lie,

1:01:36.931 --> 1:01:39.033
but that the house was
absolutely destroyed.

1:01:39.133 --> 1:01:41.636
And there's two crackheads
eating peanuts by the pool,

1:01:41.735 --> 1:01:43.871
who say that they're your friends.

1:01:44.738 --> 1:01:45.873
- They are not my friends.

1:01:45.973 --> 1:01:47.741
- If the next thing that
comes out of your mouth,

1:01:47.841 --> 1:01:49.710
isn't the truth,

1:01:49.810 --> 1:01:51.946
I don't know what I'm going to do.

1:01:55.216 --> 1:01:56.183
- Okay.

1:01:58.587 --> 1:01:59.588
I'll tell you the truth.

1:02:03.791 --> 1:02:06.126
My name isn't Rob.

1:02:06.227 --> 1:02:07.728
It's Matt.

1:02:10.030 --> 1:02:11.031
- What?

1:02:11.131 --> 1:02:13.434
- I didn't have a blind
date that night. You did.

1:02:13.535 --> 1:02:15.135
I was just sitting at the bar alone,

1:02:15.236 --> 1:02:18.906
having a shitty day, because
every day was a shitty day.

1:02:19.006 --> 1:02:21.509
And then you come over thinking
that you're being set up

1:02:21.610 --> 1:02:22.843
with me?

1:02:23.444 --> 1:02:24.878
With me!

1:02:24.979 --> 1:02:27.948
Like that would ever
happen in a million years.

1:02:28.849 --> 1:02:31.385
You called me Rob and I went with it.

1:02:31.485 --> 1:02:34.488
I don't have a friend
named Toby. I made him up.

1:02:34.589 --> 1:02:36.457
He doesn't exist.

1:02:36.558 --> 1:02:38.325
- Your name isn't Rob?

1:02:39.026 --> 1:02:42.597
- Well, it is now. I changed it legally.

1:02:42.697 --> 1:02:46.568
But time went on and at every
turn I just pictured you

1:02:46.668 --> 1:02:47.569
leaving me,

1:02:47.669 --> 1:02:50.104
because I'm shit and you're amazing.

1:02:50.705 --> 1:02:52.806
And then when I met your parents,

1:02:53.374 --> 1:02:57.612
your dad saw me for what I
really am: a fucking loser.

1:02:57.712 --> 1:02:58.912
And I thought,

1:02:59.013 --> 1:03:01.849
if I buy this house, it
would solve everything,

1:03:01.949 --> 1:03:05.386
that I could prove that I
was good enough for you.

1:03:07.087 --> 1:03:08.389
I didn't get some job promotion.

1:03:08.489 --> 1:03:11.191
I borrowed millions of
dollars from some really

1:03:11.292 --> 1:03:12.326
dangerous people.

1:03:12.426 --> 1:03:13.762
And I did it all,

1:03:14.529 --> 1:03:18.499
because if I could prove that
I was good enough for you,

1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:23.103
then I wouldn't have to worry
about losing you anymore.

1:03:25.205 --> 1:03:27.509
- You know what the worst part is?

1:03:28.777 --> 1:03:29.977
You had me.

1:03:30.878 --> 1:03:32.246
You always did.

1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:34.783
And it wasn't because of some story

1:03:34.882 --> 1:03:37.284
or because of some house, but because

1:03:37.851 --> 1:03:41.422
you were good to me and I loved you.

1:03:43.924 --> 1:03:46.260
And everything was just a lie.

1:03:46.360 --> 1:03:47.629
- Not everything.

1:03:48.295 --> 1:03:51.165
I love you. More than you'll ever know.

1:03:51.265 --> 1:03:52.634
- I can't.

1:03:52.734 --> 1:03:54.234
- Katie, please.

1:03:54.335 --> 1:03:57.706
- I think it would be best if
I went to my parents' house.

1:03:57.806 --> 1:03:59.774
- You know what? You're right.

1:03:59.873 --> 1:04:01.909
It's not safe for you with me.

1:04:02.744 --> 1:04:05.112
- No, I need to leave you.

1:04:05.212 --> 1:04:07.582
- Exactly, because I'm in danger,

1:04:07.682 --> 1:04:09.149
you shouldn't be in danger, too.

1:04:09.249 --> 1:04:12.052
- No, Rob. I mean that I
think we should split up.

1:04:12.152 --> 1:04:14.823
- Exactly, because being
together right now,

1:04:14.922 --> 1:04:18.660
until this resolves
itself, is very dangerous.

1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:20.861
- No, Rob. I mean that we're done.

1:04:20.961 --> 1:04:23.531
Me and you, it's over.

1:04:47.555 --> 1:04:52.192
♪ Somewhere on the scene ♪

1:04:52.292 --> 1:04:53.160

- Oh, I should've caught that one, yo.

1:04:56.865 --> 1:04:57.998
Dammit.

1:04:59.166 --> 1:05:01.034
You know lobsters don't die?

1:05:02.035 --> 1:05:05.005
- Bullshit. If I eat a
lobster, that shit stays dead.

1:05:05.105 --> 1:05:08.942
- No, no, no, like if
left to his own devices,

1:05:09.042 --> 1:05:10.879
he can live forever.

1:05:10.978 --> 1:05:11.912
- Yeah?

1:05:12.012 --> 1:05:13.247
- They just keep growing and growing.

1:05:13.981 --> 1:05:17.151
- Yo! Yo, we should get a lobster.

1:05:17.251 --> 1:05:19.754
We could put it in this pool
and we could keep that shit

1:05:19.854 --> 1:05:22.289
alive for like a hundred years.

1:05:22.389 --> 1:05:23.658
- 200.

1:05:23.758 --> 1:05:24.526
- Word.

1:05:24.626 --> 1:05:25.593
- Yeah.

1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:30.464
Hey, yo, Rob, you want
to get some lobsters?

1:05:32.933 --> 1:05:35.068
Rob, I said, we want to
get some lobsters, man!

1:05:36.069 --> 1:05:38.405
Well fuck you too, motherfucker!

1:05:39.607 --> 1:05:42.109
He's always acting like
he's better than us, man.

1:05:45.747 --> 1:05:47.114
You know, not for nothing,

1:05:47.214 --> 1:05:47.849
I don't think you supposed to
be diving in the shallow end

1:05:47.948 --> 1:05:48.982
like that, man.

1:05:49.082 --> 1:05:51.686
I think that's how you get CTE.

1:05:52.520 --> 1:05:54.923
That's the shit that football players go

1:05:55.022 --> 1:05:57.625
You start going crazy,
they'll figure it out.

1:05:57.725 --> 1:05:59.126
- Does he have a pipe?

1:05:59.727 --> 1:06:00.562
- A what?

1:06:00.662 --> 1:06:02.463
- A pipe, like a diving pipe.

1:06:03.997 --> 1:06:05.399
Snorkel!

1:06:05.499 --> 1:06:07.902
- Nah, nah, he ain't got no, I
don't think he got a snorkel.

1:06:08.001 --> 1:06:09.203
- Yo, he's fit.

1:06:09.303 --> 1:06:10.572
- Yeah, he is. That's, he
can hold his breath for

1:06:10.672 --> 1:06:11.271
a long time.

1:06:11.371 --> 1:06:12.973
Man, I'd have been gave up.

1:06:13.073 --> 1:06:15.342
He'll be all right.

1:06:15.442 --> 1:06:16.143
- Is that you?

1:06:16.243 --> 1:06:17.612
- Me? Oh, yeah, that is probably me.

1:06:17.712 --> 1:06:19.012
Let me go and check that.

1:06:19.714 --> 1:06:22.817
My mom didn't take her
dialysis this morning.

1:06:22.917 --> 1:06:23.685
- Oh.

1:06:23.785 --> 1:06:24.519
- Yeah.

1:06:24.619 --> 1:06:25.620
- How's she doing?

1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:26.453
- Huh?

1:06:26.554 --> 1:06:27.187
- How's she doing?

1:06:27.287 --> 1:06:28.021
- Oh, she'll be all right, man.

1:06:28.121 --> 1:06:29.223
- All right.

1:06:29.323 --> 1:06:30.290
- She acting like a
bitch sometimes though.

1:06:33.393 --> 1:06:34.328
- Fuck.

1:06:34.428 --> 1:06:34.963
Fuck.

1:06:45.540 --> 1:06:50.612
I had the best girl in the
world and now she hates me.

1:06:51.345 --> 1:06:53.447
She hates me and I'm gonna die.

1:06:55.984 --> 1:06:57.117
And even with all that,

1:06:57.217 --> 1:07:00.120
I still don't have the
balls to kill myself.

1:07:04.024 --> 1:07:05.058
- Shit got deep.

1:07:05.158 --> 1:07:05.927
- That shit got sad.

1:07:06.026 --> 1:07:06.995
- Yeah, I didn't like that.

1:07:07.094 --> 1:07:07.862
- Mm mm.

1:07:07.962 --> 1:07:09.797
- Yeah, that was dramatic.

1:07:11.198 --> 1:07:12.734
Yo, is that your phone?

1:07:12.834 --> 1:07:15.269
Yo, that shit's fucked.

1:07:15.369 --> 1:07:17.137
You might wanna put that
in some rice or something.

1:07:17.237 --> 1:07:19.406
Not brown rice because
they don't absorb the same.

1:07:19.507 --> 1:07:20.440
- No.

1:07:20.542 --> 1:07:22.342
- I don't care about anything anymore.

1:07:22.442 --> 1:07:25.780
- Well, that's just a matter
of having the wrong attitude.

1:07:26.380 --> 1:07:29.584
Interesting bathing suit,
little over dressed,

1:07:29.684 --> 1:07:30.652
if you ask me.

1:07:31.218 --> 1:07:32.252
- What do you want?

1:07:32.352 --> 1:07:33.688
- You missed our phone calls.

1:07:33.788 --> 1:07:36.724
Me and the boss, we were getting
really worried about you.

1:07:36.824 --> 1:07:39.727
- Well, I appreciate the concern,

1:07:39.827 --> 1:07:41.094
but you can go fuck off.

1:07:41.194 --> 1:07:44.364
And you can tell Big Sally
that she can fuck off too.

1:07:48.670 --> 1:07:49.202
- Excuse me?

1:07:49.303 --> 1:07:50.939
- I knew you were dumb,

1:07:51.039 --> 1:07:52.874
but I didn't realize you were deaf.

1:07:52.974 --> 1:07:54.141
So there's the door.

1:07:54.241 --> 1:07:56.511
Don't let it hit you on
the way out, you wannabe

1:07:56.611 --> 1:07:59.814
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson
looking piece of shit.

1:07:59.914 --> 1:08:01.148
- Oh, shit!

1:08:02.684 --> 1:08:03.851
- Oh, shit.

1:08:03.952 --> 1:08:06.386
- Oh, yeah? Yeah?

1:08:07.187 --> 1:08:10.424
Do it. Do it, you fucking pussy.

1:08:10.525 --> 1:08:13.293
Pull the fucking trigger.
You took everything from me.

1:08:13.393 --> 1:08:16.864
Fucking do it! Come on,
put me out of my misery!

1:08:16.965 --> 1:08:19.601
You fucking did this to me! Come on!

1:08:29.644 --> 1:08:32.346
- Jesus, kid. You lost your fucking mind

1:08:37.518 --> 1:08:38.118
Hey.

1:08:38.218 --> 1:08:40.688
Yeah, he's being difficult.

1:08:43.024 --> 1:08:43.791
It's for you.

1:08:43.891 --> 1:08:44.659
- I don't give a -

1:08:44.759 --> 1:08:45.893
- Rob? Rob?

1:08:46.661 --> 1:08:47.361
- Katie?

1:08:47.461 --> 1:08:48.930
- Rob, who are these people?

1:08:49.030 --> 1:08:50.163
What the fuck did you do?

1:08:50.263 --> 1:08:51.131
- That's enough of that.

1:08:51.231 --> 1:08:52.232
- If you hurt her, I swear to God.

1:08:52.332 --> 1:08:56.004
- Oh, look at the change in the attitude

1:08:56.104 --> 1:08:57.939
You have a lot of Mrs. Salerno's money.

1:08:58.039 --> 1:09:01.042
So you got one more shot to
save your girlfriend's life.

1:09:01.141 --> 1:09:02.409
- What do you want me to do?

1:09:02.510 --> 1:09:05.613
- Remember those waterfront
redevelopment contracts?

1:09:05.713 --> 1:09:07.782
- I was fired! Remember?

1:09:07.882 --> 1:09:09.216
I can't do anything.

1:09:09.851 --> 1:09:12.152
- Well, we're going to need
you to go burn your old

1:09:12.252 --> 1:09:13.420
office down.

1:09:14.622 --> 1:09:15.757
- Why?

1:09:15.857 --> 1:09:17.290
- Because, good luck starting
a construction when you're

1:09:17.391 --> 1:09:20.160
trying to pick up the pieces
after a horrible fire.

1:09:20.260 --> 1:09:21.495
Then, hey you fuck up.

1:09:21.596 --> 1:09:23.998
You get caught, it's a
fired, disgruntled employee.

1:09:24.098 --> 1:09:26.400
Not us. Call when it's done.

1:09:33.306 --> 1:09:36.243
- Okay
guys, I need your help.

1:09:37.779 --> 1:09:41.481
- No way. You still owe
us from the last time.

1:09:42.116 --> 1:09:44.284
It's always drama with you, dawg.

1:09:44.384 --> 1:09:46.854
We don't need the aggravation.

1:09:46.954 --> 1:09:48.122
We out.

1:09:48.221 --> 1:09:50.792
- Dawg, I don't need the headache, yo.

1:09:51.358 --> 1:09:53.795
- Well, what the fuck am I supposed to d

1:09:55.863 --> 1:09:56.864
- Get burning.

1:10:05.173 --> 1:10:07.340
- Hello? Anyone here?

1:10:10.578 --> 1:10:14.314
It's Rob. Just here to get my stuff.

1:10:50.818 --> 1:10:51.986
Hey!

1:10:52.086 --> 1:10:53.755

1:10:58.425 --> 1:11:00.094
- Turn the fucking music off!

1:11:00.194 --> 1:11:01.162
- What?

1:11:01.261 --> 1:11:02.830
- I said, "Turn the fucking music off!"

1:11:02.930 --> 1:11:03.564
- I can't hear you.

1:11:03.664 --> 1:11:05.365
- Turn the fucking music off!

1:11:05.465 --> 1:11:07.367
- Why the fuck you yelling, man?

1:11:07.467 --> 1:11:10.772
Trying to get the cops
called on us? Tripping.

1:11:11.438 --> 1:11:13.306
- Where'd you get this car?

1:11:14.075 --> 1:11:16.476
- This? Got this from Big Sally.

1:11:17.779 --> 1:11:20.615
- You stole this car from Big Sally?

1:11:21.314 --> 1:11:22.617
- Listen, man.

1:11:22.717 --> 1:11:23.851
I ain't worried about that shit, man.

1:11:23.951 --> 1:11:25.253
She got like 50 other cars.

1:11:25.352 --> 1:11:26.687
- Yo, that's not all we stole, B.

1:11:26.788 --> 1:11:29.991
We hit the medicine cabinet.
We hit the jewelry cabinet.

1:11:30.091 --> 1:11:31.859
Yo, we are set for life, son.

1:11:32.492 --> 1:11:33.728
- Are you guys fucking crazy?

1:11:33.828 --> 1:11:36.463
My girlfriend's life is on the line.

1:11:36.564 --> 1:11:40.735
- Hey, yo, the Rock and her,
man. They all fucking talk.

1:11:40.835 --> 1:11:42.270
Yo, think about it.

1:11:42.369 --> 1:11:45.740
When you bitched out
the Rock, did you die?

1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:47.675
No. You didn't.

1:11:47.775 --> 1:11:49.010
You still alive.

1:11:49.110 --> 1:11:50.545
He all talk.

1:11:50.645 --> 1:11:53.247
And besides I know for a fact,

1:11:53.346 --> 1:11:55.448
your girl ain't gonna get touched.

1:11:56.083 --> 1:11:57.350
- And why is that?

1:11:59.153 --> 1:12:00.655
- We rescued her, dawg!

1:12:00.755 --> 1:12:03.191
- Yo, she's in the trunk, dawg!

1:12:03.291 --> 1:12:04.559
- Yeah.
- She's in the trunk?

1:12:04.659 --> 1:12:05.660
- Yeah, she in the back.

1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:06.326
- What the fuck?

1:12:06.426 --> 1:12:07.562
- Yo, yo, yo!

1:12:07.662 --> 1:12:09.530

- Yo, yo, yo. Don't go on there man.

1:12:10.932 --> 1:12:13.067
Yo, I'm telling you she'd
been a bitch ever since

1:12:13.167 --> 1:12:14.068
we put her in there.

1:12:14.168 --> 1:12:15.002
- She been scratching me in the eye.

1:12:15.102 --> 1:12:16.336
She tried to bite me in the arm.

1:12:16.436 --> 1:12:18.371
- She's like a fucking honey
badger, like a raccoon.

1:12:18.471 --> 1:12:19.472
- Shut the fuck up!
- She got me in the nuts!

1:12:19.574 --> 1:12:20.775
- Open the fucking trunk.

1:12:20.875 --> 1:12:23.376
- All right. Look, I'm
gonna be honest with you.

1:12:23.476 --> 1:12:25.478
We had to knock the bitch out.

1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:27.181
Look, she's a fighter.

1:12:27.281 --> 1:12:28.448
She got a left like a motherfucker.

1:12:28.549 --> 1:12:29.851
- Open the trunk.

1:12:29.951 --> 1:12:30.918
- All right.

1:12:31.953 --> 1:12:32.587
- I said what I said.

1:12:32.687 --> 1:12:33.688
- Take it into your own hands.

1:12:33.788 --> 1:12:34.354
- Yeah.

1:12:38.726 --> 1:12:42.362
- You two are the most
inept people I have ever met

1:12:42.462 --> 1:12:43.998
in my entire life.

1:12:44.665 --> 1:12:46.734
- Yo, what's inept mean?

1:12:47.668 --> 1:12:49.136
- So, Brick, you like eggs?

1:12:49.237 --> 1:12:50.370
- I like eating them.

1:12:50.470 --> 1:12:51.706
- I'll trade you this
egg for those earrings.

1:12:51.806 --> 1:12:52.874
- What the fuck am I
going to do with an egg,

1:12:52.974 --> 1:12:54.008
shove it up my ass?

1:12:54.108 --> 1:12:55.710
- It's your favorite
breakfast food, right?

1:12:55.810 --> 1:12:57.612
- Yeah, but I plan on
selling my cut, not eating it.

1:12:57.712 --> 1:12:58.946
- Trade you
this cat and these eggs

1:12:59.046 --> 1:12:59.847
for them earrings.

1:12:59.947 --> 1:13:00.781
- Word.

1:13:03.517 --> 1:13:05.052
- It's like shark tank.

1:13:06.854 --> 1:13:11.491
- Oh, Oh! Look at the
diamonds on that ring.

1:13:11.592 --> 1:13:13.995
Oh my God. Oh, that is nice.

1:13:14.095 --> 1:13:16.163
You walk up in the club with
that and they know it's a real

1:13:16.264 --> 1:13:17.765
OG in the house.

1:13:17.865 --> 1:13:18.566
Oh my God!

1:13:18.666 --> 1:13:22.136
- Oh, oh, oh, yo my man got a Rolex.

1:13:22.236 --> 1:13:23.104
- Yo.

1:13:25.206 --> 1:13:26.574
- What the fuck is this?

1:13:27.541 --> 1:13:29.744
"May your memory bless us in death,

1:13:29.844 --> 1:13:32.346
as your smile blessed us in life."

1:13:32.445 --> 1:13:33.781
Whatever that means.

1:13:35.850 --> 1:13:36.817
Oh, shit.

1:13:37.385 --> 1:13:38.886
This is Big Sally's husband.

1:13:38.986 --> 1:13:40.187
- No, it is not.

1:13:42.422 --> 1:13:43.357
- I don't want it anymore.

1:13:43.456 --> 1:13:44.457
- Yeah, fuck that. I'm good. I'm good.

1:13:44.558 --> 1:13:45.693
- Nope. Mm mm. I don't want that no more

1:13:45.793 --> 1:13:46.928
- I don't want none of
this shit. Fuck that.

1:13:47.028 --> 1:13:48.529
Nah, man, I don't want
that shit neither, man.

1:13:48.629 --> 1:13:51.666
I don't need anybody haunting
me from beyond the grave.

1:13:52.366 --> 1:13:53.701
- Yo!

1:13:53.801 --> 1:13:54.802
- What?

1:13:54.902 --> 1:13:58.272
- It should haunt Rob.

1:13:58.372 --> 1:14:01.909
- Oh, shit, that's diabolical as fuck.

1:14:10.450 --> 1:14:11.919
- Hey.
- I ain't do nothing.

1:14:12.019 --> 1:14:13.754
- What if we bring her back and just say

1:14:13.854 --> 1:14:16.090
it was a big misunderstanding.

1:14:16.924 --> 1:14:18.059
- Nah, man, stop bitching, dude.

1:14:18.159 --> 1:14:19.593
Look, I used to be
scared of Big Sally, too,

1:14:19.694 --> 1:14:20.861
like an hour ago.

1:14:20.962 --> 1:14:23.698
Then I realized yo, she
ain't going to do shit

1:14:23.798 --> 1:14:26.200
and we got the leverage.

1:14:26.300 --> 1:14:27.702
- Yo, what's leverage?

1:14:28.569 --> 1:14:31.505
- Look, the way I see
it, she got a hostage,

1:14:31.605 --> 1:14:32.873
now we got a hostage.

1:14:32.974 --> 1:14:35.142
Look, I done watched
enough movies to know,

1:14:35.242 --> 1:14:37.778
we gotta do like a hostage exchange.

1:14:37.878 --> 1:14:39.613
Everything gonna be cool.

1:14:40.414 --> 1:14:41.615
I know you feel weak,

1:14:41.716 --> 1:14:43.617
but you ain't never been
stronger than this moment.

1:14:43.718 --> 1:14:45.186
Yo, it might be the fumes
and the pills we took,

1:14:45.286 --> 1:14:48.189
but yo bro, I see a
tunnel out of this bitch.

1:14:50.291 --> 1:14:52.059
Yo, we gotta unlock this shit.

1:14:53.427 --> 1:14:55.296
Brick, wake her up.

1:14:55.396 --> 1:14:56.530
- Yeah. Okay.

1:14:56.630 --> 1:14:59.767
- Yo, girl. Girl, hey,
wake up.

1:15:02.236 --> 1:15:04.538
Hey, girl. Yo, come on.

1:15:05.606 --> 1:15:07.208
Yo, come on. Wake up, wake up.

1:15:07.308 --> 1:15:08.309
Hello. Hello.

1:15:08.409 --> 1:15:09.443
What did you do to her?

1:15:09.543 --> 1:15:11.245
Hello. Hello.

1:15:11.345 --> 1:15:12.046
- Hey.

1:15:12.146 --> 1:15:13.314
- Aaah!
- Aah, geez!

1:15:16.417 --> 1:15:19.687
Ah, I hope you guys are having fun,

1:15:19.787 --> 1:15:22.423
because you're going to be
looking over your shoulders

1:15:22.523 --> 1:15:27.161
for the rest of your
pathetic little lives.

1:15:27.995 --> 1:15:29.430
You're dead.

1:15:29.530 --> 1:15:31.432
You're all dead.

1:15:32.199 --> 1:15:35.069
- Yeah? Well your mom's
already gonna kill me.

1:15:35.169 --> 1:15:37.471
So if you don't give me
the passcode to your phone,

1:15:37.571 --> 1:15:39.673
I'm going to bring you to hell with me.

1:15:39.774 --> 1:15:41.909
- That shit's intense.

1:15:42.009 --> 1:15:43.878
Shit, that's that alpha male shit, man.

1:15:43.978 --> 1:15:44.779
That's what I'm talking about.

1:15:44.879 --> 1:15:47.148
- I need to call your mom.

1:15:47.248 --> 1:15:50.651
Just give me the passcode
so I can end this, please.

1:15:51.685 --> 1:15:54.488
- I don't have a password.

1:15:54.588 --> 1:15:57.191
- You don't have a passcode?

1:16:01.962 --> 1:16:04.398
- Fucking idiots.

1:16:04.498 --> 1:16:05.433
Tori

1:16:05.534 --> 1:16:07.301
- Mrs. Salerno, it's Rob.

1:16:07.401 --> 1:16:09.670
First off, I just want to apologize-

1:16:09.770 --> 1:16:12.907
- You motherless fuck.
You stupid motherfucker.

1:16:13.007 --> 1:16:14.108
I should've known it was you,

1:16:14.208 --> 1:16:16.077
because you're the only
person stupid enough

1:16:16.177 --> 1:16:19.647
to come into my place, kidnap my daughte

1:16:19.747 --> 1:16:22.616
and leave your fucking
girlfriend behind with me.

1:16:22.716 --> 1:16:24.819
I'd almost respect the balls on you,

1:16:24.919 --> 1:16:26.720
if I didn't know I was
about to chop them off

1:16:26.821 --> 1:16:29.023
and shove them down your throat.

1:16:29.123 --> 1:16:31.759
If you don't bring my daughter back,

1:16:32.760 --> 1:16:34.662
I'm going to kill your girlfriend.

1:16:35.229 --> 1:16:37.665
And it's going to take
me a month to do it.

1:16:37.765 --> 1:16:41.235
- Please, no. Mrs. Salerno, I'm sorry.

1:16:41.335 --> 1:16:42.002
Please let me talk -

1:16:42.103 --> 1:16:43.771
- Yo dawg! You are doing it wrong.

1:16:43.871 --> 1:16:44.939
- You're going to get her killed!

1:16:45.039 --> 1:16:46.874
- Yo, bitch.
- Relax, man.

1:16:46.974 --> 1:16:49.009
- You are talking to
Rob's representative, now.

1:16:49.110 --> 1:16:51.078
We're going to do things a
little different, you heard?

1:16:51.178 --> 1:16:52.113
- Oh, really?

1:16:52.213 --> 1:16:53.582
- Yeah, but first off,
we're not negotiating.

1:16:53.681 --> 1:16:55.816
We're starting with,
we're going to murder your

1:16:55.916 --> 1:16:59.019
bitch ass daughter, bitch.

1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:00.354
- Are you insane?
- Yo, dawg.

1:17:00.454 --> 1:17:03.124
- Give me the phone!
- Yo dawg, she will call back.

1:17:03.224 --> 1:17:06.127
- She won't!
- She will call back.

1:17:06.227 --> 1:17:06.794
Dawg.

1:17:06.894 --> 1:17:08.062
- Word.
- Holler.

1:17:08.162 --> 1:17:09.296
- You motherfucker.

1:17:09.396 --> 1:17:12.567
You are on my list now, you
piece of shit motherfucker!

1:17:12.666 --> 1:17:14.201
Do you understand me?

1:17:14.802 --> 1:17:16.670
- Doop.

1:17:16.770 --> 1:17:18.005
- You can't.

1:17:18.105 --> 1:17:20.374
- I have her right where I want her, daw

1:17:20.474 --> 1:17:21.408
- She's not going to call.

1:17:21.510 --> 1:17:22.276
- She will.

1:17:23.444 --> 1:17:24.645
- Word.
- Holler.

1:17:24.745 --> 1:17:28.315
- You hang on me again
and I will turn your balls

1:17:28.415 --> 1:17:29.717
into chopped meat!

1:17:29.817 --> 1:17:33.988
And I will feed it to the
pigeons in the fucking park!

1:17:34.556 --> 1:17:35.590
You understand me?

1:17:35.689 --> 1:17:38.792
- Oh yeah. I could do that all night.

1:17:40.562 --> 1:17:41.328
- Word.

1:17:47.401 --> 1:17:51.640
Big Sally, before you
say anything else stupid

1:17:51.739 --> 1:17:54.808
and I hang up again, get this.

1:17:55.376 --> 1:17:58.112
We got bolt cutters and
your daughter's got fingers.

1:17:58.212 --> 1:17:59.648
So you better start taking us seriously,

1:17:59.747 --> 1:18:01.215
before we got to act seriously.

1:18:01.315 --> 1:18:02.517
Understood?

1:18:02.617 --> 1:18:03.951
- I want to talk to my daughter.

1:18:04.051 --> 1:18:08.322
- You're talking to me, now, motherfucke

1:18:10.691 --> 1:18:13.027
We're going to do a hostage exchange, yo

1:18:13.127 --> 1:18:16.797
We're going to meet at the parking garag

1:18:16.897 --> 1:18:19.166
Yanktown Boulevard, in two hours,

1:18:19.266 --> 1:18:24.104
or you are going to start
planning one fucking funeral.

1:18:25.674 --> 1:18:28.042
- I want to talk to my daughter.

1:18:28.142 --> 1:18:29.276
- Oh, okay.

1:18:29.376 --> 1:18:30.411
Is there anything you would
like to say to your mother,

1:18:30.512 --> 1:18:31.245
right now?

1:18:31.345 --> 1:18:32.614
Please talk.

1:18:32.713 --> 1:18:34.215
- Mom.
- Psych!

1:18:34.315 --> 1:18:35.950
- That's what
I'm talking about, B!

1:18:36.050 --> 1:18:37.151
That's what I'm talking about!

1:18:37.251 --> 1:18:37.918
- Yeah.

1:18:38.018 --> 1:18:38.786
- That's the intention, leverage!

1:18:38.886 --> 1:18:40.087
- Leverage, motherfucker!

1:18:40.187 --> 1:18:41.322
- That's what I'm talking about, man!

1:18:42.156 --> 1:18:43.224
That's what I'm talking about!

1:18:43.324 --> 1:18:43.958
Whoa!
- Woo!

1:18:44.058 --> 1:18:45.627
- See that? Leverage.

1:18:45.726 --> 1:18:47.094
- You guys really had my back.

1:18:47.194 --> 1:18:48.195
- Hell yeah.

1:18:48.295 --> 1:18:49.897
Listen, man, we understand
that you're the nice guy

1:18:49.997 --> 1:18:51.232
and it's okay to be the nice guy.

1:18:51.332 --> 1:18:52.466
- Totally, get it.

1:18:52.567 --> 1:18:54.368
- That's why you call Clyde
and Brick and we do the shit

1:18:54.468 --> 1:18:55.202
that you can't do.

1:18:55.302 --> 1:18:56.671
- Better than you would do it, bitch.

1:18:56.770 --> 1:18:57.639
- Word.

1:18:57.738 --> 1:18:59.840
- All right. Well, let's go.

1:18:59.940 --> 1:19:02.743
- Alright yeah, man.

1:19:03.744 --> 1:19:04.945
Oh, shit.

1:19:06.213 --> 1:19:07.147
- What?

1:19:08.382 --> 1:19:09.149
- That anti-anxiety pill,

1:19:09.250 --> 1:19:10.951
that just kicked in to like level two.

1:19:11.051 --> 1:19:12.621
- No, no, that's funny,
cause I don't feel -

1:19:12.721 --> 1:19:13.854
Oh.

1:19:14.589 --> 1:19:15.590
Oh, yeah, level two.

1:19:15.690 --> 1:19:16.824
- Yeah.

1:19:17.925 --> 1:19:19.193
Yeah, man. I ain't gonna lie.

1:19:19.293 --> 1:19:21.462
You on your own man, with
everything we taught you.

1:19:21.563 --> 1:19:22.631
- What?
- Yeah.

1:19:22.731 --> 1:19:23.831
- You can't do this to me.

1:19:23.931 --> 1:19:25.065
- Oh, it's done.

1:19:25.165 --> 1:19:26.467
- That's what
level three feels like.

1:19:26.568 --> 1:19:28.536
- Y'all got a bed in here?

1:19:28.637 --> 1:19:30.371
No, that desk looks comfy.

1:19:30.938 --> 1:19:32.406
- Do, do, do...

1:19:39.980 --> 1:19:41.583
Oh, God. Ow, my nuts.

1:19:41.683 --> 1:19:43.551
Oh, my nuts. Oh, God.

1:19:44.619 --> 1:19:45.520
- Hey Rob?

1:19:46.353 --> 1:19:49.023
Do me a favor and turn all
the lights off when you leave.

1:19:49.123 --> 1:19:49.691
Thanks.

1:19:49.790 --> 1:19:50.958
- Aah.

1:19:52.627 --> 1:19:54.361
- Oh, yes.

1:19:54.962 --> 1:19:59.366
- La, la, la.

1:20:08.108 --> 1:20:12.647
- Hey, I just want to say how
sorry I am for everything.

1:20:12.747 --> 1:20:14.982
And I really, really didn't intend

1:20:15.082 --> 1:20:16.884
for any of this to happen.

1:20:18.419 --> 1:20:19.353
So,

1:20:20.454 --> 1:20:21.955
I hear you're into art.

1:20:23.991 --> 1:20:25.359
- What are you doing?

1:20:27.061 --> 1:20:29.363
- Just making conversation.

1:20:31.566 --> 1:20:32.534
- No.

1:20:40.742 --> 1:20:42.777
- So what kind of bands are you into?

1:20:43.410 --> 1:20:47.281
- Just close the fucking trunk, please.

1:20:56.791 --> 1:20:57.958
- Hm.

1:21:27.388 --> 1:21:31.659
- You know Rob, you really
are a stupid motherfucker.

1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:32.594
- Where's Katie?

1:21:32.694 --> 1:21:33.862
- Get the girl.

1:21:34.562 --> 1:21:35.362
Where's my daughter?

1:21:35.462 --> 1:21:38.600
- I need to know that once we do this,

1:21:38.700 --> 1:21:39.834
you're not going to kill us.

1:21:39.933 --> 1:21:40.968
- Let me be clear.

1:21:41.536 --> 1:21:46.574
The only person who has been
dishonest this entire time

1:21:46.674 --> 1:21:48.075
is you.

1:21:48.175 --> 1:21:51.211
So yeah, our word is good.

1:21:51.311 --> 1:21:54.148
Where the fuck is my daughter?

1:22:02.657 --> 1:22:04.559
Oh my God. Oh my baby.

1:22:04.659 --> 1:22:06.260
Oh, oh, oh, my baby.

1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:09.029
Oh, did he hurt you? Oh, baby.

1:22:09.129 --> 1:22:12.032
- I'm so sorry for everything.

1:22:13.167 --> 1:22:14.803
- You fucking see this?

1:22:14.903 --> 1:22:16.403
- Let's get of here.

1:22:17.070 --> 1:22:20.708
- Wait. There's one more thing.

1:22:20.809 --> 1:22:21.975
I forgot.

1:22:22.777 --> 1:22:24.178
I lied.

1:22:26.113 --> 1:22:29.617
- What? Forgot to bring your guns?

1:22:29.717 --> 1:22:30.951
- You're a tornado, Rob.

1:22:31.051 --> 1:22:33.521
I mean, look how much
damage you caused just

1:22:33.621 --> 1:22:34.689
from buying a house.

1:22:34.789 --> 1:22:39.026

1:24:04.478 --> 1:24:07.381
- Strange things
happen around here, boss.

1:24:07.481 --> 1:24:10.919
- All right, let's kill
these motherfuckers.

1:24:17.725 --> 1:24:20.360
- Drop the gun now!

1:24:26.300 --> 1:24:29.403
- Just one second.

1:24:31.338 --> 1:24:33.206
- Good to see you again, Mrs. Salerno.

1:24:33.307 --> 1:24:35.810
- I trust that the local
PD read you your rights.

1:24:35.910 --> 1:24:38.646
We wouldn't want you skating
off on a technicality.

1:24:38.746 --> 1:24:39.814
You're a hard fish to catch.

1:24:39.914 --> 1:24:42.449
- You must have swapped
three cars alone coming here,

1:24:42.550 --> 1:24:44.619
but he is much easier to follow.

1:24:44.719 --> 1:24:47.855
- We have a nice video of
you pulling the trigger.

1:24:47.956 --> 1:24:49.289
- And I've got one of your goons,

1:24:49.389 --> 1:24:51.224
who'll make a deal and tell us some othe

1:24:51.325 --> 1:24:52.426
interesting things.

1:24:52.527 --> 1:24:54.896
Man, do we have some
good deals to go around.

1:24:54.996 --> 1:24:57.599
- You know, it's kind of
funny, if you think about it.

1:24:57.699 --> 1:25:01.035
After all that you've done,
how careful you've been,

1:25:01.134 --> 1:25:02.402
the murder she goes down for,

1:25:02.502 --> 1:25:04.371
is some guy she's never even met.

1:25:04.471 --> 1:25:06.239
- I'm not complaining.

1:25:06.340 --> 1:25:08.042
- So enjoy prison, Big Sally.

1:25:08.141 --> 1:25:11.244
- I think you're going
to enjoy it a whole lot.

1:25:11.345 --> 1:25:14.214
- All right. Get her the fuck outta here

1:25:37.337 --> 1:25:40.440
- Hey, is it cool if I
talk to you for a minute?

1:25:44.012 --> 1:25:45.345
- Rob, you saved my life,

1:25:45.445 --> 1:25:47.481
but you're the reason why
I'm here in the first place,

1:25:47.582 --> 1:25:50.283
so if you're about to
beg me to take you back,

1:25:50.384 --> 1:25:51.853
then I just can't do it.

1:25:51.953 --> 1:25:52.920
- I'm not.

1:25:54.756 --> 1:25:55.657
Look.

1:25:56.323 --> 1:25:59.127
This whole mess was me
trying to control everything.

1:26:00.561 --> 1:26:03.731
I tried so hard to win you over.

1:26:05.399 --> 1:26:07.769
And all I had to do is be myself.

1:26:08.936 --> 1:26:10.805
So I have to accept what's what.

1:26:11.673 --> 1:26:13.508
And if that means you
never want to see me again,

1:26:13.608 --> 1:26:16.778
then I, I have to accept that too.

1:26:16.878 --> 1:26:17.845
I hate it.

1:26:19.346 --> 1:26:20.915
But I accept it.

1:26:22.282 --> 1:26:25.218
I'm not going to ask you to take me back

1:26:26.754 --> 1:26:32.225
I just want you to know how
truly sorry I am for everything.

1:26:36.430 --> 1:26:39.199
Would it be okay if I
gave you a ride home?

1:26:39.801 --> 1:26:40.768
- Sure.

1:26:51.979 --> 1:26:53.213
Is that a -

1:26:58.052 --> 1:26:59.620
- Katie Reynolds,

1:27:03.423 --> 1:27:05.225
Will you marry me?

1:27:06.961 --> 1:27:07.929
- No.

1:27:16.003 --> 1:27:19.774
But maybe I can be okay
with trying to actually

1:27:19.874 --> 1:27:21.341
get to know you.

1:27:23.644 --> 1:27:24.311
- Really?

1:27:24.411 --> 1:27:28.983
- Yeah. Let's start over, Matt.

1:27:30.184 --> 1:27:34.589
- It's Rob. It's legally Rob.

1:27:37.792 --> 1:27:38.760
- Come here.

1:27:41.294 --> 1:27:45.199
- And that's the story of Matt Davies,

1:27:45.298 --> 1:27:47.267
a man who bit off more than he could che

1:27:47.367 --> 1:27:49.402
and swallowed it whole.

1:27:49.503 --> 1:27:51.806
Bought a house he couldn't
afford and made it

1:27:51.906 --> 1:27:54.142
into the home he earned.

1:27:54.242 --> 1:27:57.011
And finally became an honest man.

1:27:57.578 --> 1:28:01.414
Oh, and in the end, he found
the treasure after all,

1:28:01.516 --> 1:28:04.619
happiness and peace of mind.

1:28:07.889 --> 1:28:08.890
And as for me,

1:28:13.027 --> 1:28:14.996
well I'm dead, all right.

1:28:15.096 --> 1:28:18.766
I mean, hell I was going to
die sometime anyway, wasn't I?

1:28:18.866 --> 1:28:22.335
It was just a matter of time
with all the drinking I did.

1:28:22.435 --> 1:28:25.840
Well, I'd best be on my way.

1:28:25.940 --> 1:28:30.978
I'm headed to a spot up
north I hear is just heaven.

1:28:31.913 --> 1:28:33.548
So be true.

1:28:33.648 --> 1:28:34.282
Be good.

1:28:34.882 --> 1:28:39.554
