Dong is the name of
the Vietnamese guy in my class.

- He's good at math.
- That's racist.

Well, there goes
the neighborhood,

03:36.341 --> 03:38.177
they covered that open manhole.

an old oar to keep

We can't let them find my
husband's bones.

03:57.488 --> 04:00.616

violated the infidelity clause.

04:13.337 --> 04:14.713
But Julian did.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.632
Unfortunately, it only
pertained to you.

that funny.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.782

04:41.907 --> 04:43.492
Don't say that.

04:43.575 --> 04:46.245
You're stronger than you think.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.372
Look, the only thing
that matters is your freedom.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.541
You've been trapped
in this marriage for years.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.669
But now the hatch is open,
and you can climb out

04:53.752 --> 04:55.629
into the sunlight.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.089
So just go already!

04:57.173 --> 04:58.716
No, I won't!
It's a trick!

04:58.799 --> 05:01.260

05:07.058 --> 05:08.851
There must be some kind
of loophole.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.729
I don't think so,
but who knows?

05:11.812 --> 05:14.148
Your prenuptial agreement
requires that you be represented

05:14.232 --> 05:16.275
by a worser lawyer
than your husband.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.776
He gets my brother, David.

05:17.860 --> 05:20.404
David's so cool.
And he's, like, really fast.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.406
Ow.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.284
So just sign this,
and we'll initiate the proceedings.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.827
I think.

05:26.911 --> 05:29.080
I'll check with David
when I watch him work out later.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.043

05:34.126 --> 05:35.627
It's Kimmy from GED class.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.504
Shh!
I don't have papers,

05:37.588 --> 05:39.006
so at work I go
by American name.

05:39.090 --> 05:40.424
Richard Pennsylvania.

05:40.507 --> 05:44.178
Well, Richard,
I need a math tutor, big time.

05:44.262 --> 05:45.763
So far all I've learned
is that the Olsen twins

05:45.846 --> 05:46.889
are actually four people.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.390
Of course.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.893
It took two of them to play
one baby on the Full House.

05:50.976 --> 05:54.063
So if we see two of them now,
there must be four.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.981
Look, Kimmy, you seem
like a street girl--

05:56.065 --> 05:57.983
Street girl?
Hey!

05:58.067 --> 06:00.069
Oh, sorry, I meant sweet girl.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.613
I get confused because
in Vietnam, the word "duong"

06:02.696 --> 06:04.615
can mean "sweet" or "street."

06:04.698 --> 06:06.742
Or "sugar" or "road."

06:06.825 --> 06:08.827
The number one cause of death
there is when a diabetic

06:08.911 --> 06:10.788

06:10.871 --> 06:12.748

- Oh!

06:12.831 --> 06:14.833

to tutor anybody.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.127
I barely have time
to study at home

06:16.210 --> 06:17.920
because I work three shifts.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.546
My boss is so cheap.

06:19.630 --> 06:22.300
- How... cheap... is he?
- Very.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.260
He won't hire
any more delivery guys.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.594
It's a real problem for me.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.263
[laughs]

06:27.346 --> 06:28.806
It's funny 'cause it's true.

06:28.889 --> 06:29.932
Okay, I get it.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.976
You don't have any time
because of work.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.477
But I could help you.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.728
If I take
some of your deliveries,

06:34.812 --> 06:35.854
maybe you'd have some free time

06:35.938 --> 06:37.564
and we could study together.

06:37.648 --> 06:39.358
It would be nice
to have some help.

Delivering Chinese food all day

this is going to be great!

07:00.338 --> 07:01.380
Fingers crossed.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.008

to stress eat.

07:28.199 --> 07:31.369

while I watch,

07:31.451 --> 07:33.871

07:33.954 --> 07:35.247

Look, I'm happy to come
over here whenever you want,

07:54.141 --> 07:57.102

me to dinner on Thursday.

08:01.565 --> 08:02.607
Wait, huh?

08:02.691 --> 08:04.193
Kimmy, I'm so happy for you.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.987
If you play this right,
you could end up exactly like me,

08:07.071 --> 08:09.531
with a kitchen like this
and an ass that won't quit,

08:09.614 --> 08:11.491
even though it's never worked
a day in its life.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.743
What do you mean
"exactly like you?"

08:12.826 --> 08:14.578
You and Mr. Voorhees
are getting...

08:14.661 --> 08:16.330
rhymes with "shmavorced."

08:16.414 --> 08:19.583
Actually, great news:
we're not.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.419
Julian and I
are staying together.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.254
What?
No.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.297
What about your freedom,
sunlight, birds,

08:25.381 --> 08:27.216
free cocoa
at the police station.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.550
I don't expect you
to understand,

08:28.633 --> 08:30.635
but I'm used to
a certain lifestyle.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.012
He cheated on you.

08:32.096 --> 08:34.306
You can't put a price tag
on your self-respect.

08:34.390 --> 08:37.017
3,400, the amount
the Olsen quadruplets paid me

08:37.101 --> 08:38.310
to keep my mouth shut.

08:38.394 --> 08:40.979
- Mrs. Voorhees
- I've made my decision, Kimmy.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.026
Now,
where did I leave my phone?

08:54.410 --> 08:57.162
Oof,
do not go in there.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.206
Where?
Outside?

08:59.290 --> 09:01.041
You heard me.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.751
So how was your day?

09:02.834 --> 09:04.753
Walking around New York
dressed like a werewolf

09:04.836 --> 09:06.464
got... weird.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.923
Wait!

09:08.006 --> 09:09.758
Mr. Bus!

09:11.093 --> 09:12.136
[tires screech]

09:12.219 --> 09:14.263
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I don't need a cab.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.639
I was just waving.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.183
I didn't do anything.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.851
Nice day, huh, sir?

09:21.395 --> 09:23.272
Can you hold my baby?

09:26.566 --> 09:27.609
[Titus]
I got treated better

09:27.692 --> 09:29.320
as a werewolf
than I ever did as a black man.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.529
That's messed up.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.072
I'm gonna tell you
what's messed up.

09:32.156 --> 09:34.908
Our bodega started selling
Greek yogurt

09:34.992 --> 09:38.370
and bottled water
and unexpired meats.

09:38.454 --> 09:39.704
Who's that for?

09:39.788 --> 09:42.541
They're coming,
those white sons of bitches.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.209
How do you like your tea,
Dong?

09:44.293 --> 09:45.961
Milk and two roads.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.087
I think you mean two sugars.

09:47.171 --> 09:48.213
[sighs]

09:48.297 --> 09:49.798
What you got cooking
over there,

09:49.881 --> 09:52.217
a little General Tso's Revenge?

09:52.301 --> 09:53.885
What?

09:53.969 --> 09:55.929
For some reason,
that Asian fetish thing

09:56.013 --> 09:59.016
tends to go one way:
white guys into Asian women.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.686
But swim upstream,
and a lady can clean up.

10:03.395 --> 10:06.231
Trust me.
[laughs]

10:06.315 --> 10:08.192
[Kimmy] Oh, no.
It's not like that.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.152
I've actually got a date
with this guy Logan.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.862
He's super fancy, like...

10:11.945 --> 10:13.947
"Kimberly, don't eat that
spaghetti with your hands.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.825
I'm quite serious.
It's awful."

10:17.535 --> 10:19.537
Mm, be wary
of a rich man's interest.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.829
Odds are it's a prank.

10:20.912 --> 10:24.208
That's how I was duped
on the unaired VH3 reality program

10:24.291 --> 10:25.709
Joe Invisible Millionaire.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.839
Oh, you're not invisible,
Joe.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.592
Because I can see your heart.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.015
Whatever.
I got to the final round.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.017
Let's see a black man do that
on The Bachelorette.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.270
Well, Logan is very real,
and Dong is a friend.

10:45.354 --> 10:46.438
How dare you.

10:46.522 --> 10:47.814
He's not just "dong."

10:47.898 --> 10:50.275
He's also a mouth and a butt.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.281
Oh, thank you.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.283
Okay, Kimmy, try this one:

10:58.367 --> 10:59.910
"Instead of paying
his credit card,

10:59.993 --> 11:03.121
César spends his last $30
on Powerball tickets.

11:03.205 --> 11:06.542
When he wins, should he take
the lump sum now or the annuity?"

11:06.625 --> 11:07.751
I don't know.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.628
Lump sum.
Money makes money.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.046
Wait, how?

11:11.129 --> 11:13.048
Like... sex?

11:13.131 --> 11:16.510
No, it's just
the compounding interest.

11:16.594 --> 11:17.844
Here.

11:17.928 --> 11:18.970
Eh.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.390
Ms. Jacqueline,
there's a lady here to see you,

11:21.473 --> 11:24.268
but she won't sign
the reality show appearance waiver.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.562
Oh, that's okay.
I gave up on that idea.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.522
It was only gonna be
the bathrooms anyway.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.610
Mimi Kanassis?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.945
What a lovely surprise.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.197
Well, you're certainly
keeping it tight.

11:37.281 --> 11:39.116
I'm doing this new workout
where I carry furniture

11:39.199 --> 11:40.618
up and down stairs.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.162
My trainer is an Israeli guy
who owns a truck--

11:44.246 --> 11:45.705
Wait a minute.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.207
It's a moving company.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.333
Well, sorry to drop in
unannounced,

11:48.417 --> 11:50.294
but I got a message from someone
named Kimmy.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.671
She sounded simple,
like she was born near a river.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.173
A river?
Thank you.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.301
- Wait. You called Mimi?
- I did.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.177
You mentioned how great
Ms. Kanassis has been doing

11:59.261 --> 12:02.180
since she got divorced,
so if you won't listen to me,

12:02.264 --> 12:04.182
maybe you'll listen to someone
who's been through it.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.977
Jacqueline, my divorce
was the best thing

12:07.060 --> 12:08.437
that's ever happened to me.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.563
I'm in a book club.

12:09.647 --> 12:11.940
I-- I can't do this.

12:12.023 --> 12:14.151
I came over here to convince you
to get a divorce,

12:14.234 --> 12:15.860
just so I could seduce Julian.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.696
And then if you didn't go
for it,

12:17.779 --> 12:19.657
I was gonna kill you both.

12:19.739 --> 12:23.160
Oh,
I want all this back so bad.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.538
Oh, Carrara marble.

12:26.622 --> 12:28.039
[panting]

12:28.123 --> 12:30.501
Oh, I want to feel it
against my skin.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.085
I don't understand.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.421
You just went to Italy
with your boyfriend.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.507
Italy?
I was in Naples, Florida.

12:36.590 --> 12:40.135
And "boyfriend" is the name
of my loneliness therapy dog.

12:40.218 --> 12:43.347
You have no idea how hard it is
to completely change your life.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.764
Do you know what the difference
between a million

12:44.848 --> 12:45.932
and a billion is?

12:46.016 --> 12:47.976
Well, M is 13,
and B is 2,

12:48.059 --> 12:50.270
so M minus B is...
11?

12:50.354 --> 12:51.396
What?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.524
All I got in the settlement
was the Hamptons house

12:53.607 --> 12:55.734
and friendship custody
of the Olsen octuplets.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.235
All I'll get is $1 million...

12:57.319 --> 12:58.445
What?

12:58.529 --> 12:59.571
For every year
we were married.

12:59.655 --> 13:00.989
You said you'd get peanuts.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.367
That's 12 million peanuts.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.784
You'd pay a dollar a peanut?

13:04.868 --> 13:06.620
Oh, go home to your boyfriend,
Mimi.

13:06.704 --> 13:07.871
I can't.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.498
When we were in Florida,
he jumped into a shark...

13:09.581 --> 13:10.957
on purpose.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.835
12 million is less than
Julian had when we got married.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.379
I can't go back to living
like that.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.673
Our racehorse was so ugly.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.007
- Now, come on, Mimi.
- Oh, no.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.175
Let's get you the hell out
of my house.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.301
Oh,
your hands are so soft.

13:21.385 --> 13:22.678
Yeah, thank you, honey.

13:22.761 --> 13:25.055
Okay, all right.
Oh, wait. Okay.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.265
Here we go,
back to the door.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.851
Vera,
there's a package here for you.

13:30.018 --> 13:31.811
"All of LeBronda's dreams
have come true

13:31.895 --> 13:33.188
after winning the lottery."

13:33.271 --> 13:35.482
Who is writing
these questions?

13:35.566 --> 13:38.193
"The Pick Six Institute
for Lottery Advancement,

13:38.276 --> 13:40.028
a Division of the CIA"?

13:40.111 --> 13:41.946
It doesn't matter.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.407
I'll never get algebra.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.283
No, Kimmy, it'll click.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.202
I'm sorry.
I'm having a bad day.

13:47.285 --> 13:51.164
My boss is being a real B-I-T
of a J-E-R-K.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.083
I'm sorry.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.002
But you're not allowed to be sad
in Central Park.

13:56.086 --> 13:59.256
I came to New York because
of movies like Wall Sugar...

13:59.339 --> 14:00.382
Wall Street.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.550
Home By Myself Again...

14:01.633 --> 14:02.676
Home Alone 2.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.429
and The Puppet Frog
and Pig Wife Take Manhattan.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.431
When Harry Met Sally?

14:07.514 --> 14:09.558
And all of my favorite scenes

14:09.641 --> 14:11.184
were always right here
in this park.

14:11.268 --> 14:12.352
Like the restaurant
in Ghostbusters,

14:12.436 --> 14:14.938
where Rick Moranis gets turned
into the Keymaster?

14:15.021 --> 14:16.481
That place is right near here.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.858
The only place I can't find
is the opening

14:18.942 --> 14:21.445
for my favorite show:
Six White Complainers.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.365
Oh, I believe in America
it's called Friends.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.409
[gasps]
The fountain?

14:27.492 --> 14:28.952
I know where it is.

14:29.035 --> 14:33.707
[upbeat music]

14:33.873 --> 14:35.500
[in Korean]
♪ So no one told you ♪

14:35.584 --> 14:39.003
♪ That adults

14:39.087 --> 14:43.467

14:43.550 --> 14:45.636
Hey, you two, that ain't
the Friends fountain.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.887
- It's not?
- I'm Richard Pennsylvania from Epcot.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.556
People think it is,
but the real one

14:49.640 --> 14:50.974
is in a studio lot in Burbank.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.559
It looks totally different.

14:52.643 --> 14:54.144
Are we in trouble,
Coppicer?

14:54.227 --> 14:56.396
Nah, I'll give
you two lovebirds a break.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.815
Oh, no, it's not like that.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.274
Yeah, I just like Dong.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.568
Me, too.
Don't tell the guys.

15:07.783 --> 15:09.660
Did I not offer Mimi a water?

15:09.743 --> 15:11.995
Well,
Dong just cheered me up.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.330
- I bet it did.
- Enough.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.790
"Dong" is a common
Vietnamese name.

15:14.873 --> 15:15.791
No more jokes.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.794
And I'm not giving up on you
doing the right thing.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.378
You're coming with me right now.

15:20.462 --> 15:23.465
Will I be back in time
to move a two-bedroom apartment?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.930
What happened here?
Did Hurricane Katrina come back?

15:31.014 --> 15:33.475
Kimmy, no.
She's one of them.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.603
You,
go back to Amagansett.

15:36.687 --> 15:39.105
Ahh!

15:39.189 --> 15:41.024
Lillian!

15:43.985 --> 15:46.613
Mrs. Voorhees, I know
you don't think you can live

15:46.697 --> 15:48.365
on your divorce settlement,
but you're tough.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.618
You survived Julian's cheating
and Buckley breastfeeding

15:51.702 --> 15:53.036
long after his teeth came in.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.830
Oh,
he was born with a full set.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.916
So if my roommate and I
can live here on nothing,

15:57.999 --> 16:00.126
you're definitely strong enough
to get by on 12--

16:00.210 --> 16:02.128
Wait, you live here?

16:02.212 --> 16:04.255
Certainly this can't be
all of it.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.257
I know,
I'll go upstairs.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.721
Mrs. Voorhees,
you're not listening to me.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.222
This is about you.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.348
No, it's not.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.183
When are you seeing Logan,
tomorrow?

16:15.266 --> 16:17.143
- What?
- This is unacceptable.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.020
You have to lock him down now.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.731
You'll need a condom and a pin.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.983
And I need to get out of here
before I get airborne diabetes.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.362
No.
Mrs. Voorhees...

16:28.196 --> 16:31.282
And this is for what
you crackers did to Tribeca.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.493
And this is for the M&M store.

16:33.577 --> 16:36.329
And this is for
non-ethnic mustaches, and--

16:36.413 --> 16:38.331
Uh-oh.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.208
- Kimmy.
- Ahh!

16:40.291 --> 16:41.418
Titus,
why are you dressed like that?

16:41.501 --> 16:42.544
You didn't even go
to work today.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.504
I've decided to live
as a werewolf.

16:44.588 --> 16:45.630
Wha--?

16:45.714 --> 16:47.716
It's so much easier than being
an African-American man.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.134
Security guards don't follow me
around in stores,

16:50.218 --> 16:51.970
dogs have stopped barking at me,

16:52.053 --> 16:55.306
and no one mistook me
for Samuel L. Jackson all day.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.433
I'll kill you, Kimmy.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.394
You need to change your life.

16:59.477 --> 17:00.562
Logan.
Lock it down.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.856
I just came from work,

17:02.940 --> 17:04.649
and Hu Zha Qi docked my pay
because of you.

17:04.733 --> 17:05.776
What did I do?

17:05.859 --> 17:07.151
All your orders came up short.

17:07.235 --> 17:08.653
Do you not know how
to make change?

17:09.738 --> 17:13.450
Okay, it's $25.43,
and you gave me $41,

17:13.533 --> 17:17.454
so 100 minus 43,
take the 1 from the zero...

17:17.537 --> 17:20.832
wait... wait.

17:20.916 --> 17:22.375
I'm not good at math.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.043
So unbelievable.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.546
I'm trying to save money
to hire an immigration lawyer,

17:26.630 --> 17:27.839
and you lost $200.

17:27.923 --> 17:30.091
Why not just kick me
in the tooths?

17:30.174 --> 17:31.217
It's "teeth."

17:31.301 --> 17:32.343
That's insane.

17:32.427 --> 17:33.887
And I never should
have agreed to help you.

17:33.971 --> 17:35.680
Out of all the persons
in the world,

17:35.764 --> 17:38.976
all the mans and all the womans,
you're the most bad.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.270
It's people, men, women,
and worstest.

17:42.353 --> 17:43.438
And this is your fault.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.564
You're supposed to be
teaching me math,

17:44.648 --> 17:45.983
and I haven't learned anything.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.151
What a waste of time.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.528
Tell me about it!

17:50.612 --> 17:53.615
Oh, nice.
Real classy.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.333
Well, Kimmy,
Julian's coming home tonight

18:03.416 --> 18:06.377
so, fingers crossed,
this will all be behind us.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.630
Ugh, now I see it.
That's gross.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.842
But, Mrs. Voorhees,
you can't stay with him.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.301
Do the math, Kimmy.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.719
It's not enough money.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.554
I spend 100 grand a month.

18:16.638 --> 18:17.973
I'll be broke in ten years.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.432
[Dong]
Money makes money.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.559
It's just
the compounding interest.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.561
Ten years?

18:23.645 --> 18:25.647
No, that's wrong.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.862
So $100,000 times 12 months.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.572
That's 1.2 million a year.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.533
Those are not
erasable markers.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.327
Divide that into 12 million,
and yes,

18:39.410 --> 18:40.996
you'd be broke in 10 years.

18:41.079 --> 18:46.209
But if you invest some of it,
assuming a 7% rate of return,

18:46.292 --> 18:48.545
using the compound interest formula,

18:48.628 --> 18:51.464
where P equals 6 million...

18:56.135 --> 18:58.722
Your money would almost double.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.432
That's why you take the lump sum
when you win the lottery.

19:01.516 --> 19:04.895
Mrs. Voorhees, I mathed,
and you can get divorced.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.730
U-S-A.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.065
U-S-A.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.441
It's not really
about the money.

19:10.525 --> 19:11.735
Exsqueeze me?

19:11.818 --> 19:13.737
It's not really
about the money.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.866
I'm scared, Kimmy.

19:17.949 --> 19:19.868
I don't have a family
to go back to.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.995
All my friends are people I pay:

19:22.079 --> 19:23.914
trainers and stylists
and beauticians.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.750
And I doubt they say,
"Wow, your anus really responds

19:26.833 --> 19:28.919
to the laser"
because they want to.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.546
I'm afraid of starting over.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.965
You don't understand
how hard the world can be.

19:34.049 --> 19:37.010
Mrs. Voor-- Jacqueline,

19:37.094 --> 19:40.346
I need to tell you something.

19:40.430 --> 19:41.514
I'm a Mole Woman.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.725
Oh, don't say that, dear.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.810
Yes, you have beady little
rodent eyes,

19:45.894 --> 19:47.311
and your hands are rough
and claw-like,

19:47.395 --> 19:48.271
and when you eat--

19:48.354 --> 19:49.606
No, listen to me.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.524
My name is not
Kimmy Smith.

19:51.608 --> 19:54.652
I'm Kimmy Schmidt
from Indiana,

19:54.736 --> 19:56.613
as in the Indiana Mole Women.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.741
I was kept in a bunker
for 15 years

19:59.824 --> 20:01.118
by an insane preacher.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.535
I thought the world had ended.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.245
I thought I would die there.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.957
But I survived,
because that's what women do.

20:07.040 --> 20:10.668
We eat a bag of dirt, pass it
in a kiddie pool, and move on.

20:10.752 --> 20:11.962
I hope that's a metaphor.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.671
It's not.
We needed the iron.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.924
I came to New York with nothing.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.927
But I found Titus and Lillian
and you.

20:19.010 --> 20:22.055
I got a room and a job
and a temporary tattoo

20:22.139 --> 20:23.848
that says "You're Grape."

20:23.932 --> 20:25.642
And tonight I'm going
to dinner with a guy

20:25.725 --> 20:30.147
who wears hats with brims
that go all the way around.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.941
I do understand the world,
Mrs. Voorhees.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.777
It's tough,
but so are we.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.155
Oh, Kimmy.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.282
Why didn't I do a background
check before hiring you?

20:43.576 --> 20:46.037
I'd be your friend
even if you didn't pay me.

20:46.121 --> 20:49.499
And I'm saying this
because I want to:

20:49.582 --> 20:52.293
your anus is really responding
to the laser.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.053
U-S-A.

21:02.137 --> 21:05.765
[both] U-S-A.
U-S-A. U-S-A.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.266
[knock at door]

21:08.893 --> 21:10.145
Dong, finally.

21:10.228 --> 21:12.271
I'm here purely
on food business.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.696
Look, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry,

21:19.779 --> 21:21.614
and I promise
I'll pay you back somehow.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.659
Also, for what it's worth,
you did teach me math.

21:24.742 --> 21:28.872
That's worth zero,
which is a number, by the way.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.249
I work so hard just trying
to get on my feet,

21:31.332 --> 21:34.585
so someday men will look up
to me and say, "Nice teeth.

21:34.669 --> 21:36.129
You must own many oxen

21:36.213 --> 21:38.631
and have to pick women
off you like lice."

21:38.715 --> 21:40.008
But thanks to you,

21:40.091 --> 21:42.552
I'm this close to being out
on the street.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.845
Wait a minute.

21:43.928 --> 21:46.848
Feet, men, teeth, oxen,

21:46.931 --> 21:49.142
women, lice, street?

21:49.226 --> 21:51.144
And did you say "cacti"?

21:51.228 --> 21:52.729
No, but I could.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.397
Ow,
so many cacti.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.108
Dong, your English,
it's amazing.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.693
From hanging out with you,
Kimmy.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.195
You make my English better.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.906
So... study buddies?

22:04.657 --> 22:05.825
Oh, sorry.

22:05.909 --> 22:07.160
I forgot you don't touch.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.138
They keep coming.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.938
Excuse me.
Hey, I'm looking for Kimmy.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.065
Oh, yeah.
Oh, welcome.

22:37.148 --> 22:38.691
Hey, I love your hat,

22:38.775 --> 22:41.111
all the way around
and everything, it's...

22:41.194 --> 22:45.073
Kimberly, wow,
you look simply divine.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.742
I could listen to you
English guys talk all day.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.493
Oh, my word.
No, no, I'm from Connecticut.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.538
Yeah, my parents just insisted
all the children learn British.

22:52.622 --> 22:53.664
I didn't speak a word
of American

22:53.748 --> 22:55.750
until I arrived at college, bro.

22:55.833 --> 22:59.212
I told you this neighborhood
was about to blow up, Todd.

23:00.004 --> 23:02.506
[Titus]
Help me! Please!

23:02.590 --> 23:03.841
Honey,
that werewolf needs help.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.218
It's the glue.

23:05.302 --> 23:07.971
It's losing
its adhesive properties.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.431
I'm transforming.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.849
[howls]

23:11.933 --> 23:14.769
...long did I think
I could stay in this costume?

23:14.852 --> 23:17.814
Oh, God, the werewolf.
It turned into Samuel L. Jackson.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.232
[screams]

23:19.316 --> 23:20.399
[dogs barking]

23:20.483 --> 23:22.986
Oh, Titus, oh, come here.

23:23.069 --> 23:26.948
You just saved the neighborhood,
you glorious bastard.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.326
All right, then.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.910
Have you decided where you want
to go to dinner?

23:32.287 --> 23:35.123
I can't believe I'm at
the Ghostbusters restaurant.

23:35.206 --> 23:36.916
I haven't been here since
I was about six,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.709
when I and had to get
all dressed up with Daddy.

23:38.793 --> 23:41.420
You know, they've remodeled
since the movie.

23:41.504 --> 23:42.713
Interesting factoid:

23:42.797 --> 23:44.799
Bill Murray only agreed
to do the film

23:44.882 --> 23:47.218
so that the studio would let him
make Razor's Edge.

23:49.512 --> 23:50.763
Wow.

24:03.985 --> 24:05.569
[laughs]

24:07.030 --> 24:08.365
[speaks indistinctly]

25:21.687 --> 25:23.064
Good night, everybody!
