WEBVTT

00:19.480 --> 00:23.320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:33.600 --> 00:36.080
Hello, welcome to Top Gear,

00:36.080 --> 00:39.040
where we've got a proper treat of
a show lined up for you.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.920
Tonight, each of us gets to do

00:40.920 --> 00:43.080
something truly extraordinary

00:43.080 --> 00:45.960
and I'm talking
proper bucket-list stuff.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.560
I drive the world's rarest supercar.

00:48.560 --> 00:51.160
Chris drives an actual time machine

00:51.160 --> 00:53.440
and Fred drives to Lincolnshire.
LAUGHTER

00:53.440 --> 00:55.120
Living the dream.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.200
But we kick off with a review.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.800
Isn't that right, Christopher?

00:58.800 --> 01:00.080
Yes.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.320
There's a new supercar out
there from Aston Martin

01:02.320 --> 01:04.560
and it's like no supercar
seen before,

01:04.560 --> 01:06.400
and, rather, irritatingly,

01:06.400 --> 01:10.040
they sent Patrick McGuinness
to drive it.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.840
LAUGHTER

01:16.480 --> 01:18.040
Meet Victor.

01:20.400 --> 01:25.200
A hulking, brooding brute
of a machine...

01:25.200 --> 01:26.960
ENGINE REVS

01:26.960 --> 01:29.880
..that's part '80s muscle car,

01:29.880 --> 01:31.640
part futuristic racer.

01:33.400 --> 01:34.800
It is seriously powerful.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
It's seriously rare.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.800
It's everything you could possibly
want from a supercar.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.080
Just look at it.

01:48.080 --> 01:52.040
This might be the best-looking
car I've ever seen.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.040
In fact, I think it might be
the best-looking thing

01:55.040 --> 01:56.600
I've ever seen.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.280
And when I said it was powerful,
I wasn't lying -

01:59.280 --> 02:02.400
836 horsepower.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.560
And when I said it was rare,

02:04.560 --> 02:07.760
this is the only one
that will ever be built.

02:07.760 --> 02:11.120
And the man who owns it has kindly
lent it to us.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.680
OK.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.040
I'd better be careful...

02:27.200 --> 02:28.440
..ish.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.840
ENGINE REVS

02:31.840 --> 02:34.160
Ho-ho-ho!

02:34.160 --> 02:36.080
ENGINE REVS LOUDER

02:43.200 --> 02:46.320
CAR SCREECHES

02:50.760 --> 02:53.280
Oh, my word!

02:56.680 --> 02:58.360
This is not right!

03:00.600 --> 03:02.680
He's gone mad.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.000
He's gone absolutely mad!

03:05.000 --> 03:10.080
Upfront, the Victor's packing
a stonking great V12.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.920
Weighing in at a massive 7.3
litres...

03:16.160 --> 03:18.360
Four turbos for efficiency.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.640
No hybrid for economy.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.800
..Victor is an absolute old-school
monster.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.400
As for how fast this monster
will run, though,

03:30.400 --> 03:32.120
because it's a one-off,

03:32.120 --> 03:34.520
nobody quite knows.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.200
But what I can tell you is this.

03:39.640 --> 03:43.000
I'll get my 60 in first gear...

03:43.000 --> 03:46.400
..90 in second...

03:46.400 --> 03:49.680
..120 in third...

03:49.680 --> 03:51.880
..and I've still got three gears
to go!

03:55.320 --> 03:57.080
Please, Louise!

03:58.440 --> 04:03.880
So, in conclusion, nought to 60,
very, very small number,

04:03.880 --> 04:06.600
max speed, very, very big number.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.000
Right.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.200
Enough of that now.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.040
Time to give the old ticker a rest.

04:17.160 --> 04:20.400
So, what on earth is this
Victor, then?

04:21.720 --> 04:24.640
The wild performance is pure
21st century...

04:26.600 --> 04:30.200
..but the way it goes about it
is savagely primitive.

04:31.640 --> 04:36.320
Take the interior, a steering wheel
from the Millennium Falcon,

04:36.320 --> 04:38.920
but a gear nob from an old
walnut tree.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.920
None of it makes sense.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.480
Until, that is, you understand
the decades of Aston history

04:48.480 --> 04:50.920
that have been poured into it.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.880
Think of the Victor as
Aston Martin's greatest ace.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.400
This is the ultimate compilation,

05:01.400 --> 05:05.320
the looks are pure old-school
muscle.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.880
In fact, the designers took
inspiration

05:07.880 --> 05:12.080
from this - the 1970s race car
nicknamed The Muncher.

05:12.080 --> 05:16.600
Then we went to the 1980s
and the V8 Vantage road car.

05:16.600 --> 05:20.320
And, looking at this, you can
already see the family resemblance.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.600
Then, underneath, we go all
21st-century Aston

05:23.600 --> 05:26.680
with the One-77 supercar,

05:26.680 --> 05:30.880
same chassis, same engine,
but with extra power.

05:30.880 --> 05:35.160
And to finish it all off,
same steering wheel and suspension

05:35.160 --> 05:37.560
as the Vulcan racer.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.160
Of course, to put it another way,
you might say the Victor

05:44.160 --> 05:48.440
is just a big mashup of reheated
Aston leftovers.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.640
But trust me.

05:53.680 --> 05:58.440
Get properly stuck in, and you soon
find that as leftovers go,

05:58.440 --> 06:02.120
these are very, very tasty.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.080
Oh!

06:09.080 --> 06:10.640
Man!

06:12.280 --> 06:14.480
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

06:16.520 --> 06:18.080
Woo!

06:20.400 --> 06:22.840
Woohoo!

06:22.840 --> 06:24.720
Yeah!

06:24.720 --> 06:26.240
That's what we're talking about.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.760
Oh!

06:31.520 --> 06:33.880
The steering, the ride,

06:33.880 --> 06:35.920
the way it puts its power down,

06:35.920 --> 06:38.120
this doesn't feel like a mashup.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.320
This thing is proper!

06:47.840 --> 06:50.000
CAR SCREECHES

06:51.120 --> 06:53.600
Woo-hoo-hoo!

06:53.600 --> 06:55.280
Yeah, ha-ha-ha! Hey!

06:56.720 --> 07:00.000
That is mad!

07:00.000 --> 07:05.320
But it isn't half as mad as
what the thing costs.

07:05.320 --> 07:09.080
Now, let's be honest, you're not
going to be disappointed

07:09.080 --> 07:11.960
if this thing is very expensive.

07:11.960 --> 07:16.280
Oh, trust me, you're not
going to be disappointed.

07:16.280 --> 07:19.120
Because the Victor costs...

07:19.120 --> 07:21.280
..Â£4 million.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.240
And who cares?
They've only made one!

07:26.640 --> 07:28.000
All right.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.200
If you're going to be all boring
and rational,

07:30.200 --> 07:32.600
you could, for the price of one
Victor,

07:32.600 --> 07:37.040
have 20 new McLarens
and go just as fast.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.160
But forget boring and rational,

07:42.160 --> 07:44.560
it's a supercar!

07:44.560 --> 07:47.000
It's not supposed to make sense.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.960
Come on!

07:48.960 --> 07:52.480
Oh, my word!

07:52.480 --> 07:57.960
Let's face it, these bonkers, crazy,
expensive supercars

07:57.960 --> 08:00.720
are meant to be ridiculous.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.440
They're meant to be daft.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.440
I absolutely love this car!

08:07.520 --> 08:09.400
And the Victor,

08:09.400 --> 08:13.520
well, it's the daftest of the lot.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.720
Do you know, I love that stuff
like this exists,

08:16.720 --> 08:20.680
and I love that I got
the chance to drive it.

08:20.680 --> 08:24.160
But most of all, I love
that it's still in one piece.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.000
Victor, it's been a pleasure.

08:35.040 --> 08:36.760
HE EXHALES

08:36.760 --> 08:38.400
Absolute work of art.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

08:50.840 --> 08:53.440
Wow. Wow.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.680
That, for me, is what an
Aston Martin should look like.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.120
It's a muscle car.

09:00.120 --> 09:04.120
It does look amazing, but even
for a one-off, four million quid -

09:04.120 --> 09:06.000
that's bonkers, Pad.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.720
Yeah, but the price literally
doesn't matter.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.040
They're only making this one.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.200
And it's already sold,
so you can't even buy it.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.800
Just enjoy it.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.520
I'm not comfortable saying this,

09:17.520 --> 09:19.720
but I agree with McGuinness.
LAUGHTER

09:19.720 --> 09:21.440
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

09:21.440 --> 09:23.760
It may be a load of old
Aston bits underneath,

09:23.760 --> 09:25.080
when it looks like this,

09:25.080 --> 09:27.320
it's brilliant.  Exactly.

09:27.320 --> 09:30.280
And now we must move on
because Freddie Flintoff

09:30.280 --> 09:31.680
has as an itch to scratch.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.080
I thought that had cleared up.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.240
I do feel the need to explain now,
Paddy,

09:35.240 --> 09:37.360
because ever since I started
Top Gear,

09:37.360 --> 09:39.320
there's one thing I've wanted to do.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.160
I've wanted to learn to race
properly,

09:41.160 --> 09:43.040
to become a qualified racing driver.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.440
Kind of like what Chris does.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.680
Oh, so you're saying
that I'm your idol?

09:46.680 --> 09:48.360
I am not saying that AT ALL.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.600
Get that straight out of your head.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.000
What I wanted to know was,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.640
can you turn a middle-aged
ex-cricketer with a dodgy knee

09:55.640 --> 09:58.000
into a proper, serious racing
driver?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.640
So I went to find out.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.800
I've had a fascination with speed
ever since I can remember,

10:11.800 --> 10:13.840
whether it's cars or cricket balls,

10:13.840 --> 10:16.280
I want everything to be fast.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.720
It's dangerous.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.240
You feel vulnerable,
you feel alive.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.320
Rather than say, why do you want to
drive fast?

10:23.320 --> 10:26.880
Why would anybody not want to?

10:26.880 --> 10:29.680
To become a racing driver,

10:29.680 --> 10:32.040
first, you need a licence,

10:32.040 --> 10:34.600
and that means you have
to take a test.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.960
Mine would be in just two days'
time.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.560
So to get up to speed,

10:39.560 --> 10:43.560
I'd be getting a crash course
in racing from the experts.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.520
Ginetta is a British road
and race car manufacturer,

10:48.520 --> 10:51.040
one whose
Driver Development Programme

10:51.040 --> 10:55.000
has produced the likes of W Series
champion Jamie Chadwick

10:55.000 --> 10:57.320
and McLaren F1 star Lando Norris.

10:58.960 --> 11:02.000
This is a company with a serious
reputation.

11:03.880 --> 11:06.160
One that I'd be trying my best
not to ruin

11:06.160 --> 11:08.840
as I arrived at the Blyton Park
test track

11:08.840 --> 11:11.480
to meet top trainer Mike Simpson.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.080
Wow.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.360
Hi, Mike. This is proper, isn't it?

11:18.360 --> 11:20.040
It is, morning, Fred.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.720
How are you doing?  All right?

11:21.720 --> 11:23.120
Welcome.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.800
I've done a few track days
and you turn up

11:24.800 --> 11:27.400
and there are some nice cars out,

11:27.400 --> 11:29.680
but these are proper
racing cars.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.360
This is what we do for a living.

11:31.360 --> 11:32.720
We start off 14-year-old kids

11:32.720 --> 11:35.480
actually straight from karting,
in our school in the G40.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.560
I'm not going in that, am I?
You're not going in that.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.720
We're going to skip a step

11:38.720 --> 11:41.040
and go straight into
the GT4 level G55,

11:41.040 --> 11:43.680
which is a thoroughbred race car.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.360
Have you seen this show before,
Mike?

11:45.360 --> 11:46.480
I have. Yeah, yeah.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.920
Have you seen me in a car?  I have.

11:47.920 --> 11:50.520
Yeah, that's why I'm here.
Oh, good.  Yeah.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.320
I just thought we should clear
that up.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.720
No, it was fine. I trust you.
I trust you, Fred.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.440
It's not often I hear them
words near a car.

11:59.560 --> 12:03.640
The G55 is designed to give
drivers like me

12:03.640 --> 12:06.480
the first taste of a proper race
car.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.000
Its 3.7 litre V6 produces 270
horsepower,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.800
which doesn't sound like a lot.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.440
But coupled to a full race-spec
gearbox

12:17.440 --> 12:20.240
in a car that weighs just 1,100
kilos,

12:20.240 --> 12:23.560
it gives you plenty to think about.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.400
Oh, my word.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.520
Go for it!

12:33.800 --> 12:36.000
I'm looking for my racing licence.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.360
When I started this job,
this is one thing I wanted to do.

12:39.360 --> 12:42.440
I don't know why I didn't
expect it to be so fast.

12:42.440 --> 12:45.600
But I've got two days before I go
for my test.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.800
It's brilliant, but at the same
time,

12:48.800 --> 12:53.280
I'm aware that I've put myself
under quite a bit of pressure here.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.080
Down to third.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.680
The other thing for me is
I want to be decent at it,

12:57.680 --> 12:59.880
so I'm going to have a real go
at this.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.320
Nose in.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.200
Your line discipline is very good.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.920
Don't be fooled, I'm not
a complete muppet.

13:07.920 --> 13:12.440
Getting to grips with the car
on a damp and slippery track,

13:12.440 --> 13:15.840
Mike needed to see what he was
really working with,

13:15.840 --> 13:18.480
and that meant going solo

13:18.480 --> 13:20.160
to lay down my first lap time.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.160
Rome wasn't built in a day.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.400
Preston might have been.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.720
Three, two, one, go!

13:31.960 --> 13:33.520
Whoa.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.880
That was a messy start.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.520
We're on the gas, don't chase
it now

13:39.520 --> 13:41.480
because you've had a bad start.

13:41.480 --> 13:43.440
Now get braking.
Get off the brakes.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.520
I'm in... Can he hold it?

13:45.520 --> 13:46.840
Oh, I've held it, I've held it!

13:46.840 --> 13:50.200
I felt like I was going too fast,
but we're all right.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.360
Yes, there we go!

13:52.880 --> 13:55.120
We've got the nose of the car.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.680
1:24.7.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.560
We can work with that for sure.

14:04.560 --> 14:08.960
Baseline established, it was time
for the real training to begin.

14:10.640 --> 14:13.040
Second, off the brake.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.520
Feed it in.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.720
Go. Hard now, in a straight line.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.200
Now we're talking.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.000
Want to be braking about now.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.040
Starting to come away from the
brake.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.640
On the power.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.400
Woohoo!  Go on, then!

14:27.400 --> 14:29.960
I did feel a bit twitchy at some
times

14:29.960 --> 14:32.680
and I got out of it, but...
Where is he?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.200
Not 100% sure how I got out of it.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.280
Control the throttle.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.280
Now.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.000
Yes, no, brilliant!

14:41.000 --> 14:43.240
"It's going well, isn't it?"
I go, "Cheers, mate!"

14:43.240 --> 14:44.880
Not a clue.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.120
Squeeze the power, start to wind
the steering off.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.120
Go, go, go.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.680
Off the brake, second.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.920
Feed it in. Catch it
if you need to, catch it!  Argh!

14:54.920 --> 14:56.360
So close!

15:00.160 --> 15:02.280
It's starting to look quite
aggressive,

15:02.280 --> 15:04.440
where, before, you sort of had
a lift,

15:04.440 --> 15:06.560
then braked a bit and then
braked a bit more,

15:06.560 --> 15:08.360
where, now, you're flat out.

15:08.360 --> 15:09.560
Bang!

15:09.560 --> 15:11.920
And that's how a racing driver acts.

15:14.240 --> 15:18.640
I think I need to get faster,
but in a controlled manner.

15:18.640 --> 15:21.360
And I know I've only been doing
it for a morning,

15:21.360 --> 15:24.200
but now I've only got
a day and a half left.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.720
And just to add to the pressure,

15:28.720 --> 15:31.440
the afternoon session would be
soaking.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.360
You wouldn't be on the pitch
at Lords, would you, like this?

15:36.360 --> 15:37.800
Oh, I'd be well gone by now.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.480
I'm a cricketer. We don't do rain.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.280
A little bit aggressive on
the turning,

15:45.280 --> 15:47.680
just turned it a little sharp there.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.880
That was a kerb, wasn't it?
Yeah, a bit of kerb.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.920
The biggest challenge for Fred
is going to be

15:53.920 --> 15:56.640
to understand how much
he can ask of the car.

15:59.720 --> 16:02.040
He'll need to go through a little
bit of pain out there

16:02.040 --> 16:04.120
and make some mistakes for him to
feel it

16:04.120 --> 16:07.240
and figure out where he needs to be.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.280
Nearly the barrier.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.160
Ah!

16:15.160 --> 16:18.440
He will be a racing driver
at the end of this.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.640
Day two of training,

16:21.640 --> 16:25.760
and with just 24 hours to go
until the licence test,

16:25.760 --> 16:29.240
Harris wanted to check in
on my progress.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.360
I was so pleased when I saw
the sun this morning

16:31.360 --> 16:34.280
when I opened my curtains.  Yeah.
I don't want more rain.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.200
Here he is.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.000
Look at it, boy racer.
Popping and banging.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.400
Hi. How are you?  Good. How are you?
Really good, actually.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.760
Really good.  Enjoyed it?

16:43.760 --> 16:45.680
I enjoyed it more than I thought
I was going to.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.960
I thought I'd like it,
but I've really liked it.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.040
OK, weather today's balmy,
yesterday?

16:50.040 --> 16:52.200
Oh, it was dreadful.
Just dreadful.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.280
Excuse, you work on the excuse.
I like it, Mike.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.360
I'm just giving you the facts,
giving you the facts.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.480
He did a great job.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.680
We put him through his paces.
It was a test of my skills.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.000
Did you find yourself having to take
it quite seriously,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.600
or more seriously than you expected?
I was really focused.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.360
There's no messing about, really.

17:06.360 --> 17:09.200
What I didn't do, I didn't just go
gung-ho at the start.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.040
I started...  Normally, what you do
is you go 110%

17:12.040 --> 17:13.440
and then ramp it back.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.360
Back, yeah. I went the other way
this time.

17:15.360 --> 17:17.840
OK, well, I'm loving this.
Well, Fred, at the end of this,

17:17.840 --> 17:19.720
and I can't believe I'm saying it...
Say it.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.800
You're going to be a racing driver.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.880
Well, you know, cricketer,
boxer...  Yeah.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.120
..musical theatre, actor...  Yeah.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.440
..philanthropist.
What's that...?

17:29.440 --> 17:30.560
What's that word for...?

17:30.560 --> 17:32.560
Philanthropist.  That's the one,
charity.  Yeah.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.640
What's the one...? What's the...?

17:34.640 --> 17:37.040
What's the word where he does
businesses?

17:37.040 --> 17:39.200
Entrepreneur.  Entrepreneur.
Yeah.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.000
Right. I'm going to leave you to it.
No, no, no, no, no. No, you're not.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.640
Why?  You're going to put a lap down
so I've got something to aim at.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.800
OK, so what lap time did you manage
yesterday in the wet?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.080
He did a 1:24.7.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.520
Go and get ready.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.640
I was going to have a cup of coffee,
but now I'm... OK.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.080
Want me to warm the car up for you,
Chris?  Yes, please, Fred.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.200
That's what us racing drivers do,
isn't it?

17:58.200 --> 17:59.200
Come on, Fred.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.840
Three, two, one, go!

18:05.840 --> 18:07.320
CAR SCREECHES

18:09.680 --> 18:12.200
Oh, he's having a right go at
it, look at him!

18:16.200 --> 18:17.880
This is fast, isn't it?

18:17.880 --> 18:21.080
Second gear at the chicane,
so he got a good exit.

18:21.080 --> 18:24.560
This is the technical little
bit. Got to get an apex.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.800
Sacrifice a bit in the middle.

18:25.800 --> 18:29.160
Then go wide open...

18:29.160 --> 18:30.400
I'm standing back.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.720
I don't want to be anywhere near
this.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.720
Oh.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.720
I've always had a respect
for Chris Harris, of course I have.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.160
Probably even more so now.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.680
I've been doing a bit of this.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.840
He bangs on about it, doesn't he?

18:44.840 --> 18:46.960
Me and Paddy just humour him.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.080
Well, now, I'm starting to think,
"Fair play, Chris.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.800
"You're actually really good
at this, aren't you?"

18:53.800 --> 18:55.240
Hazard a guess?

18:55.240 --> 18:56.360
13, 14. Somewhere there.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.880
No, you're quicker than that.

18:57.880 --> 19:00.600
What?  1:11.78.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.760
I think we've given you something
to aim for.

19:02.760 --> 19:05.080
If I get anywhere near that,
I'll be over the moon.  I know.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.720
That's a serious challenge, is that.
He's saying it's quick.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.920
No. No, you'll get in there.
Well, we've got some work to do.

19:10.920 --> 19:14.200
Harris had just gone round 13
seconds faster

19:14.200 --> 19:16.760
than anything I've managed so far.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.400
But now, with a dry track to play
with,

19:20.400 --> 19:23.320
it was time to see how close Mike
could get me

19:23.320 --> 19:25.080
to that 1:11 benchmark.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.880
So hell of a lot for grip.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.040
Power, power.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.880
The hardest bit is I've got to put
it all together in one lap

19:35.880 --> 19:39.240
and then do it again and again
and again.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.360
That was a 15:0.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.600
A little quick.
Catch it, catch it, catch it.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.040
CAR SCREECHES

19:47.040 --> 19:48.960
Racing requires consistency.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.360
And with training time almost up,

19:53.360 --> 19:58.160
the only way to get that would be to
head out on my own and focus.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.680
Three, two, one, go!

20:08.880 --> 20:11.800
A little bit of a touch on the
brake. Bring it round.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.240
One of the things I've found
is if I talk through it...

20:14.240 --> 20:17.160
Mind that kerb, it's a big one!

20:17.160 --> 20:20.240
..almost commentate to me own
driving, it helps me concentrate.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.560
Into fifth. Now on the brake.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.000
I'm thinking about what gear I'm in,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.600
my speed going into corners, my
lines - if I talk through it,

20:28.600 --> 20:30.560
I'm almost planning it.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.200
Don't go chasing Harris -
just drive.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.640
This is a very different
Andrew Flintoff.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.440
It's measured and controlled.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.720
Now out.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.280
Go, go, go!

20:45.400 --> 20:47.480
What did he get?  1:13.08.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.600
That's not bad.  It's not bad at all.

20:49.600 --> 20:50.800
Go!

20:52.440 --> 20:54.400
Better start.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.960
I've got to correct...
Keep concentrating.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.760
This looks nice!  This is quick.
Go on, Freddie!

21:05.200 --> 21:06.520
13.09.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.680
Go!

21:09.960 --> 21:12.640
I think that was really good.
Yeah.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.640
Not too shabby.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.320
Nice.  I think there was less messing
about there.  Yeah.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.840
Don't back off.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.440
I think that was a better lap.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.920
13.07.  So that's where he's at.

21:26.920 --> 21:29.320
Yeah.  That's where he's at, 13.07.

21:29.320 --> 21:32.640
Three laps within a tenth and a
half. That's impressive, actually.

21:35.040 --> 21:38.080
So, that's it, training's over.
Top job, as far as I'm concerned.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.960
The fact that you were consistent is
everything.  That's right, that's

21:40.960 --> 21:43.600
what a racing driver's job is -
consistency is how you win a race.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.520
The next stage now is to get
the licence.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.920
You've got to be official.
Exam time.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.760
I'm going to swot up tonight, Chris.

21:58.480 --> 22:03.080
My test would take place the next
afternoon at Donington Park.

22:06.320 --> 22:09.800
The exam itself is split into two
parts -

22:09.800 --> 22:12.960
practical and, first up, theory.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.440
Hello.  Hello.

22:19.440 --> 22:24.160
My name is Stuart Jones,
I'm your examining instructor today.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.920
OK, Stuart, I'm Fred.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.720
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
a little bit nervous.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.520
I've learnt all the flags. I hope.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.840
First section, second
section, third section,

22:33.840 --> 22:35.720
you have to get 100%.  Yeah.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.680
Fourth section, you've got to get

22:37.680 --> 22:40.600
five out of the eight questions
right, OK?

22:50.200 --> 22:53.520
I've been looking to find out
what else I can revise

22:53.520 --> 22:55.200
for the other questions.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.080
And it seems you can't.

22:57.080 --> 23:00.360
It's the first time I've been
in a forum, trying to find out

23:00.360 --> 23:04.440
but, no, they just say it's common
sense and things you should know.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.200
The things that I SHOULD know...

23:08.520 --> 23:10.560
..aren't quite right sometimes!

23:10.560 --> 23:12.800
HE READS QUIETLY

23:20.520 --> 23:22.320
Are you confident?

23:22.320 --> 23:23.720
Relatively.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.800
All right, well, we'll put that in
for marking now, and then we'll go

23:26.800 --> 23:30.200
get suited up,
and we'll go do our practical.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.760
OK. Thank you.

23:33.160 --> 23:36.600
I was banking on that being the
easy bit.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.560
This is the hard bit now,
on the track.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.720
And look at the weather -
the clouds are coming in.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.520
We don't need none of that. It looks
like the end of the world

23:43.520 --> 23:45.080
down there. We need to get out.

23:45.080 --> 23:48.280
Um, yeah, this is the bit
I'm more nervous about.

23:51.880 --> 23:55.240
The practical test plays out
over three laps.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.600
Stuart will be assessing every
aspect of my driving,

23:58.600 --> 24:02.400
looking to make sure I had the
control not to pose a risk to myself

24:02.400 --> 24:03.960
or other racers.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.600
Things that will fail you
instantly is

24:07.600 --> 24:09.680
if I have to take control
of the car,

24:09.680 --> 24:11.840
if you run off the circuit,

24:11.840 --> 24:14.440
if you miss a flag or a light

24:14.440 --> 24:16.960
and I have to tell you about it,

24:16.960 --> 24:18.720
or if you kill me.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.760
FREDDIE CHUCKLES
OK?

24:20.760 --> 24:22.840
That's an instant failure,

24:22.840 --> 24:24.920
and I will haunt you afterwards.

24:27.880 --> 24:31.080
OK. Green light tells us
that the track is live.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.720
OK, make sure you check
for other people on the circuit.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.160
We're all good.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.760
Stuart would give me a couple
of laps to get to know the track.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.400
And then...

24:48.400 --> 24:49.960
..we begin!

24:51.040 --> 24:53.440
Right, you're on, go, go, go, go!

24:53.440 --> 24:55.280
Three good laps, Fred.

24:55.280 --> 24:58.160
Coming in... I've got this one,
coming round.

24:59.440 --> 25:03.360
A little bit... And break...
Drop gear.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.840
Onto the brake, drop down,

25:04.840 --> 25:07.640
look for the apex, seen it,
going in.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.680
Onto the accelerator.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.920
Braking, looking out there,

25:11.920 --> 25:14.480
I'm going to clip this kerb.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.960
Bit of a lift...

25:15.960 --> 25:18.840
Coming out, coming out, feeding it.
One more lap, Fred.

25:20.280 --> 25:21.960
Onto the brake.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.280
Now I'm turning in. Down into third,

25:25.280 --> 25:27.480
coming round, coming round.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.920
Now I'm out of it.
Get on, get on, get on!

25:29.920 --> 25:32.000
I can see the apex, I'm coming in.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.720
Middle of the track.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.480
I'm on it.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.560
Get in the pit lane this time, pit
lane this time.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.640
Nice and easy into pit lane.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.640
OK, so from a practical
point of view, um,

25:53.640 --> 25:55.920
you were definitely consistent.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.160
I was watching you,

25:57.160 --> 25:59.800
your head's moving all the time,
which is superb.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.720
You're looking through the corner,
you're looking at your mirrors,

26:02.720 --> 26:04.360
you're very aware
of what's going on.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.360
You ticked all the boxes for you to
pass your practical test.  Amazing.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.200
We just need to see whether we've
got you through your theory now.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.640
OK.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.680
Right. All right.

26:16.680 --> 26:19.400
So, section one.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.520
Yeah.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.880
Uh, there was... You got 15 right.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.200
Yes.
And you needed to get 15 right.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.640
So that was a pass.

26:26.640 --> 26:29.240
Section two, you got three right,
and you needed to get

26:29.240 --> 26:31.040
three right.  Oh, thank God for that.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.880
I didn't sound many, three, did it?!

26:32.880 --> 26:37.280
Section three, again, you got
all the questions right on that.

26:37.280 --> 26:40.480
On your last one, which was sort of
your general knowledge....

26:42.280 --> 26:44.240
..I'm pleased to say you passed.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.640
Oh, get in! High five it,
high five it, Stu!

26:46.640 --> 26:48.720
Get in! I can race!

26:48.720 --> 26:51.920
Come on! I didn't pass me driving
test till t'third time.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.280
Oh, he tells me that now! Brew time.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.080
Oh, of course, I'll make them.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.600
Did anybody ask for a racing driver?

27:00.600 --> 27:03.440
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.  Well done!

27:03.440 --> 27:06.280
APPLAUSE
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm so relieved.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.640
Yeah, I actually drove all right
there as well.

27:10.640 --> 27:14.560
But to get a racing licence is one
thing.

27:14.560 --> 27:18.880
To call yourself a racing driver
is a whole new game.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.280
INDISTINCT COMMENTARY

27:34.200 --> 27:39.680
This is the GT Cup Championship -
a Pro-Am series that sees grids

27:39.680 --> 27:43.120
of over 30 cars racing side-by-side.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.840
For my first ever race,

27:46.840 --> 27:51.280
I'd be sharing a track with Lambos,
Porsches, McLarens and Astons.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.360
And raising the stakes even higher,

27:55.360 --> 27:58.680
the car I'D be driving had gone up
a level too.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.200
It's called the GT4.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.080
It looks a lot like the old GTA,

28:06.080 --> 28:09.640
but this one has
100 more horsepower,

28:09.640 --> 28:13.760
bigger brakes, more aero
and slick tyres.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.240
What all that meant was

28:17.240 --> 28:19.920
free practice was an eye-opener.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.640
Cars everywhere!

28:24.000 --> 28:25.880
come on, off you go.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.880
Oh, you  BLEEP!

28:27.880 --> 28:30.480
He was giving me nothing, that lad!

28:34.040 --> 28:37.240
I was battling it. I really was -
myself, the car,

28:37.240 --> 28:38.720
everything that's going on.

28:40.600 --> 28:41.960
I see YOU!

28:43.840 --> 28:45.560
BLEEP!

28:48.760 --> 28:50.880
Come on, Fred, you're better
than this.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.120
I expected it to be hard.

28:55.600 --> 28:56.880
Not this hard.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.600
Jesus!

29:01.560 --> 29:03.640
Feeling way out of my depth,

29:03.640 --> 29:07.640
and about as far from competitive
as I'd been since we started,

29:07.640 --> 29:11.880
Mike was doing his best to find
some good in my performance.

29:11.880 --> 29:15.800
So you did a 14:05. It's good.
Good progress.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.040
You started on a 23,
so good progress.

29:20.240 --> 29:24.320
A 2 minute 14 second
lap time was all well and good,

29:24.320 --> 29:26.640
but it didn't take a genius
to work out

29:26.640 --> 29:29.160
that to even get up to the back
of the pack,

29:29.160 --> 29:31.880
I'd need to find nearly ten seconds.

29:33.200 --> 29:36.040
I'm in the deep end, aren't I?
I need to start swimming.

29:36.040 --> 29:38.280
At the minute,
I'm treading water, I think.

29:39.800 --> 29:43.680
But, with qualifying up next,
which would decide where in the pack

29:43.680 --> 29:45.520
I'd be startin the race,

29:45.520 --> 29:49.800
in all honesty, I was just fighting
to keep my head ABOVE water.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.880
Too much speed.

29:55.880 --> 29:57.520
Calm yourself down.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.960
You're driving like a road car,
you don't like that.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.040
Think like a driver.

30:03.040 --> 30:06.200
You're no longer a cricketer,
that ship has sailed, son.

30:08.480 --> 30:11.640
One's off. He's got his bonnet open
as well.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.600
Oh, you absolute  BLEEP!

30:21.640 --> 30:24.560
Making it through
just about unscathed...

30:24.560 --> 30:26.680
BLEEP!

30:26.680 --> 30:30.560
I had qualified two places
off the back of the grid.

30:32.160 --> 30:35.840
For the race itself, me and Harris
would be driving as a team,

30:35.840 --> 30:38.920
each getting a 25-minute stint
at the wheel.

30:40.600 --> 30:43.880
As I would be heading out first,
while the pit crews were

30:43.880 --> 30:46.880
hard at work, prepping the cars for
the main event,

30:46.880 --> 30:49.320
I went to compare notes
with my team-mate.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.520
It's just a bit of a sensory
overload.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.000
You know, you've got all
these people, all these cars,

30:56.000 --> 30:58.920
all these noises. I don't know if
embarrassed is the right word,

30:58.920 --> 31:01.160
but you've got all these people here
for you.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.800
And then you're thinking,
"Am I doing all right here?"

31:03.800 --> 31:07.200
Let's face it, normally
in your other life,

31:07.200 --> 31:09.600
you just rock up, smash it,

31:09.600 --> 31:12.240
it's easy cos you can just deploy

31:12.240 --> 31:14.200
ball skills, coordination,

31:14.200 --> 31:16.520
bit of confidence. This is a
bit more involved,

31:16.520 --> 31:17.960
there's a lot more going on.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.760
You can't just... It's inconceivable

31:19.760 --> 31:21.440
that you just rock up and smash
this.

31:21.440 --> 31:25.560
If your noggin isn't quite engaged
and you're a reasonable driver,

31:25.560 --> 31:29.040
that can be the difference between
ten positions on a race day.

31:30.800 --> 31:34.000
What's your trademark?
Follow the person that's fast.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.360
Yeah? Is that it?  Yeah!

31:37.960 --> 31:40.280
You're like the lad who copied
homework, aren't you?!

31:40.280 --> 31:41.680
Oh, absolutely.

31:49.920 --> 31:53.720
What I REALLY wanted was to see
how close I could get

31:53.720 --> 31:55.920
to a competitive time.

31:55.920 --> 31:58.400
One minute, boys, till we can
start queuing up.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.920
Ready?

32:00.880 --> 32:02.520
Yeah. All good.

32:03.600 --> 32:07.880
Maybe if I could somehow stay
in touch, I might even give Harris

32:07.880 --> 32:10.120
the chance to fight for places.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.280
But that was just the wish list.

32:16.280 --> 32:20.520
The only REAL question was, would
all the training and the testing

32:20.520 --> 32:24.280
and the practice count for anything
when it mattered?

32:25.600 --> 32:29.280
You can see just how warm it is
here at Snetterton, as the cars

32:29.280 --> 32:31.400
are heading out onto the grid.

32:34.120 --> 32:38.240
Lot of cars for little Snetterton.
Lots of very, very, very fast cars!

32:43.600 --> 32:46.320
Here they come, the big boys
are coming through.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.440
WHISTLE BLOWS

32:55.440 --> 32:57.600
This is bonkers.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.200
How do I get myself into these
situations?

33:01.600 --> 33:03.200
I need a wee.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.600
OK, Fred, all looking good?

33:06.600 --> 33:08.120
Yeah, all good, thanks, mate.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.200
Stay out of trouble on that first
lap. Let them all go off around you.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.440
Just stay out of trouble
on that first lap.  Will do, boss.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.200
Come on, Freddie, lad,
time to shine.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.760
See what you've got.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.400
So off they head on their final
formation lap, let's guide you

33:25.400 --> 33:27.240
through the grid and the starting
drivers.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.360
Don't stall it, don't stall it.
He's rolling,

33:29.360 --> 33:30.800
he's rolling, he's rolling.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.480
He's away!

33:32.480 --> 33:35.840
Go on, Frederick!
Number three, Charlotte Gilbert

33:35.840 --> 33:38.000
starts alongside car number 19,

33:38.000 --> 33:39.840
which is James Hilary. The 17th row

33:39.840 --> 33:42.120
of the grid is number six,
Alex Stevenson,

33:42.120 --> 33:43.520
alongside car number ten,

33:43.520 --> 33:45.720
it's a new entry for
the team HARD Ginetta,

33:45.720 --> 33:47.640
in the hands of Freddie Flintoff.

33:49.280 --> 33:53.040
Oh, there's a bit of traffic out on
this course, look at all the cars!

33:54.680 --> 33:58.320
Ooh, nerves!  I'd love if there was a
heart rate monitor on,

33:58.320 --> 34:00.760
this is a man who famously
is ice cool,

34:00.760 --> 34:04.520
but I suspect he's up in the 150s
now!  Oh, dripping with sweat.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.040
When we come round these corners

34:08.040 --> 34:10.040
for the next time,
we're going to be off.

34:12.240 --> 34:15.280
They start to get themselves into
neat two by two order.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.720
Red, red, red, red,
red, red, red, red.

34:20.200 --> 34:22.360
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

34:23.920 --> 34:27.160
Round eight of the 2021 GT Cup
Championship gets under way.

34:27.160 --> 34:29.120
There's two come in besides.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.160
Contact, and that's John Seale,

34:31.160 --> 34:34.360
who's gone into the back
of John Dillon.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.040
They're all at it, these lads!

34:37.200 --> 34:40.160
Braking, braking! Let's stay
in that pack, Freddie boy!

34:47.720 --> 34:48.960
Come on, Fred!

34:52.280 --> 34:56.440
I'd survived the first lap,
but with that 2:14 practice run

34:56.440 --> 34:59.880
still ringing in my ears,
it was time to get my head down

34:59.880 --> 35:04.200
and use the rest of my stint
to see how much faster I could go.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.480
Get in your rhythm.

35:08.480 --> 35:11.240
Hanging on there, Jeez!

35:11.240 --> 35:13.400
That is the fastest I've taken that.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.320
Whoa!  Come on!

35:15.320 --> 35:17.640
40.6, first sector.
That's his quickest first sector.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.320
You have the weekend already.  Yeah.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.520
That's as quick as some
of these up here, look.  Yeah.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.760
You little get!

35:25.040 --> 35:28.360
Oh, another one.
Stay there, you, stay there.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.640
Come on!

35:31.440 --> 35:33.960
2:08.5.  Wow!

35:35.600 --> 35:37.160
Oh, well done, lads.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.440
Power, come on.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.360
He's just been overtaken by a couple
of cars,

35:48.360 --> 35:50.960
but, crucially for Fred,
he can see what's ahead of him.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.840
He starts to follow stuff,

35:52.840 --> 35:55.720
and when he's got something
to follow, he goes quicker.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.360
If we could just have a car in front
of us

35:58.360 --> 36:00.920
with an Australian batsman
on the back of it...

36:00.920 --> 36:02.720
He'd have that record, wouldn't he?

36:02.720 --> 36:04.440
..he'd be at it like a rat.
He would.

36:04.440 --> 36:07.040
RADIO:  OK, Fred, there's about
15 minutes remaining.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.360
Thanks, mate.

36:09.360 --> 36:12.600
The clock was ticking
down to my handover to Harris,

36:12.600 --> 36:15.320
and I was starting to find
my stride.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.920
Wow. Mega.

36:19.920 --> 36:23.320
39.4...  Look up here!
..in the first sector.

36:23.320 --> 36:24.960
39's up here, look.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.240
This is a mega lap, this.

36:27.680 --> 36:28.960
Come on...

36:31.640 --> 36:32.920
He's hanging on here, isn't he?

36:40.680 --> 36:43.040
2:05!  That's amazing.
That's perfect.

36:43.040 --> 36:46.440
That's his best lap by two seconds.
Two seconds, yeah.

36:46.440 --> 36:51.920
Come on, Fred, 2:05.7. So, fastest
lap - well, your fastest lap ever.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.720
Freddie Flintoff has done
a fantastic job

36:56.720 --> 36:58.600
over the course of this weekend,

36:58.600 --> 37:00.880
and picked up
more and more and more pace.

37:02.720 --> 37:06.560
But this is racing, and I was about
to be reminded

37:06.560 --> 37:10.320
that your luck can change
in an instant.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.560
ENGINE SPLUTTERS

37:17.960 --> 37:19.600
Car's playing up.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.200
RADIO:  OK, mate. We've got about
six turns until your stop.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.080
Just hold out till then.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.600
Just getting into it.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.200
Agh!

37:41.480 --> 37:43.280
And into the pit lane
they start to pour.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.560
Well, he's just done a 2:08,

37:46.560 --> 37:48.720
but the car went past didn't
sound so good.

37:57.440 --> 38:00.560
Box this lap, Fred, box this lap.
Box, box, box.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.280
Into the pit lane comes
Freddie Flintoff.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.080
How bad's the engine, Fred?

38:16.080 --> 38:17.760
Is it dead?
As soon as you get in fifth

38:17.760 --> 38:20.400
and you get your foot to the floor
when it gets to the top end,

38:20.400 --> 38:21.680
it just starts misfiring.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.480
Just see how you think, Chris.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.000
Agh!

38:33.280 --> 38:35.240
Chris Harris at the wheel
of the GTA Ginetta

38:35.240 --> 38:36.840
can make his way into the race.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.720
ENGINE RATTLES
Oh, I've got a big old misfire.

38:44.720 --> 38:48.120
This is going to be a fairly torrid
few laps, I think.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.000
Yeah, this is not drivable now.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.320
So sorry, but that is not drivable.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.400
Just two laps into Harris's stint...

39:08.400 --> 39:09.600
ENGINE WHINES

39:10.880 --> 39:12.320
Got nothing.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.120
It's just died.

39:16.440 --> 39:19.440
..our race was over.

39:21.320 --> 39:22.520
Here he is, he's gone!

39:24.440 --> 39:26.800
Oh, what a disappointment!

39:26.800 --> 39:28.000
Sorry, Fred.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.800
Retirement for the number 10
Ginetta.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.760
a sorry end to the weekend

39:33.760 --> 39:35.600
for Freddie Flintoff
and Chris Harris.

39:37.120 --> 39:41.720
So, that is the other side
of racing for Andrew Flintoff.

39:41.720 --> 39:44.680
Sometimes it happens like that -

39:44.680 --> 39:47.240
but Fred did so well,

39:47.240 --> 39:49.760
actually, it is what it is,
isn't it?

39:49.760 --> 39:52.120
And I'm really pleased for him.
I don't feel that sad at all.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.200
Strange feeling.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.920
Normally I'd be throwing
my helmet around, but I'm not.

40:04.080 --> 40:07.240
So, that was disappointing,
but, selfishly...

40:08.480 --> 40:10.240
..I'm actually quite pleased.

40:12.720 --> 40:15.680
All my career, I've struggled
with debuts.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.640
I've never thought I've done
myself justice

40:17.640 --> 40:19.600
when I've done something
for the first time.

40:19.600 --> 40:22.440
I reckon this is my best debut
I've ever had -

40:22.440 --> 40:23.760
and we didn't finish.

40:23.760 --> 40:26.440
Whether that's a reflection of how
bad the other ones are

40:26.440 --> 40:29.080
or how this one went, I don't care.

40:31.160 --> 40:34.520
From where I was, so nervous,
not wanting to put my foot down

40:34.520 --> 40:37.200
and worrying about
the limits of the car,

40:37.200 --> 40:39.680
I was hoping that summat
would happen at some point

40:39.680 --> 40:41.760
where it'd all be put together,

40:41.760 --> 40:43.080
and it seemed to.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.880
I can race! Come on!

40:45.880 --> 40:47.400
You know, I'm still not
the fastest -

40:47.400 --> 40:49.000
I'm probably still one of
the slowest -

40:49.000 --> 40:51.400
but from where I started,
for me, that was an achievement,

40:51.400 --> 40:55.160
and, for a moment, probably two
or three laps out there,

40:55.160 --> 40:56.960
I did feel like a driver.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.800
I'm not going to spray
any champagne,

41:06.800 --> 41:08.320
but what a weekend.

41:15.520 --> 41:17.840
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

41:17.840 --> 41:19.560
Gutted.  Me too.  Gutted.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.360
So much fun.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.080
So much fun.  That is racing.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.080
Gutted.

41:25.760 --> 41:29.040
I'm gutted for you.
Look, you didn't finish the race,

41:29.040 --> 41:30.840
but look how happy you both are -

41:30.840 --> 41:33.080
Fred, how did it feel
to be a racing driver?

41:33.080 --> 41:35.160
I tell you what, Pad, I loved it.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.600
I didn't think it'd be that hard,

41:36.600 --> 41:39.600
I've got a new-found respect
for racing drivers...  Yeah.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.320
..and although this lad's
not me idle,

41:41.320 --> 41:43.520
I've got more of a respect
for what this lad does.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.640
He can drive.
Oh, he can do a little bit.

41:45.640 --> 41:49.360
Now, listen, is there any chance
you two will ever finish a race?

41:49.360 --> 41:50.960
We had it in Baja,
we had it in this one.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.720
You've got to be able
to finish a race.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.520
Oh, you had to!  You've got to be
able to do it.

41:54.520 --> 41:56.960
I hate to say it, I'm behind the
wheel when it breaks, always.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.400
Yeah, there you go. Do you want
to do the next one with me, Pad?

41:59.400 --> 42:00.800
Yes!  Yes!

42:02.640 --> 42:03.760
Unbelievable.

42:03.760 --> 42:07.040
You just said you break the cars!
Flipping turncoat, you are.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.400
Chris, what do you make
of Fred's performance?

42:09.400 --> 42:10.880
He did a great job -
but most of all,

42:10.880 --> 42:12.880
we finally saw
the professional sportsman.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.920
The eyes changed.  Yeah.
They changed.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.440
Dangerous, he was.

42:16.440 --> 42:20.880
And now we must move on, because
this year marks the 40th anniversary

42:20.880 --> 42:24.320
of one of the most famous
and strangest cars ever made.

42:28.240 --> 42:31.000
The superstar celebrating
the big four-oh...

42:33.800 --> 42:37.720
..is the unmistakable,
the timeless,

42:37.720 --> 42:39.680
DMC DeLorean.

42:43.200 --> 42:46.880
Yes, it was four decades ago,
back in 1981,

42:46.880 --> 42:52.360
that this stainless steel wedge
arrived back from the future.

42:57.800 --> 43:03.120
It would, of course, become
the greatest movie car of all time -

43:03.120 --> 43:06.320
but not even Hollywood could
have dreamed up the story

43:06.320 --> 43:11.720
of its creation, a story
of supermodels and drug deals,

43:11.720 --> 43:15.120
the story of a man who would
stop at nothing

43:15.120 --> 43:17.640
to change the course of history.

43:19.640 --> 43:23.320
That man was John Zachary DeLorean.

43:23.320 --> 43:26.520
A genius engineer
born and raised in Detroit,

43:26.520 --> 43:30.120
working at General Motors
in the 1950s,

43:30.120 --> 43:33.800
he would go on to develop
Pontiac's legendary GTO.

43:36.160 --> 43:39.840
This was the man that arguably
invented the muscle car...

43:41.720 --> 43:43.840
..and in a world of grey suits,

43:43.840 --> 43:47.360
DeLorean was a sharp dressing,
swaggering playboy.

43:48.480 --> 43:50.160
He hung out with the stars.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.800
He married models.

43:51.800 --> 43:56.120
He even treated himself
to a brand-new chin.

43:56.120 --> 43:58.400
Probably, to be successful
as an executive,

43:58.400 --> 44:00.720
you have to have a certain
amount of ego.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.840
That ego, though, didn't sit well

44:02.840 --> 44:06.120
with the buttoned up world
of boardroom bureaucracy.

44:06.120 --> 44:08.200
DeLorean wanted more.

44:12.560 --> 44:17.680
So, in the '70s, he stomped
off to form his own car company -

44:17.680 --> 44:19.840
one with a grand vision

44:19.840 --> 44:25.760
to create an affordable, exciting
and ethical sports car,

44:25.760 --> 44:28.880
one that he said would live forever.

44:30.440 --> 44:32.440
Not lacking confidence, our John.

44:37.120 --> 44:39.240
He wanted a car that was striking.

44:39.240 --> 44:41.560
I remember him saying to me
very early on in the programme

44:41.560 --> 44:44.520
that there were three things
that were absolutely sacrosanct.

44:44.520 --> 44:47.400
One was the stainless steel body,

44:47.400 --> 44:49.200
the other was the rear engine

44:49.200 --> 44:51.200
and the third
were the gull-wing doors.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.840
To sort the styling, in 1975,

44:54.840 --> 44:57.880
DeLorean turned to the legendary
designer

44:57.880 --> 45:02.880
behind some of the most beautiful
Ferraris and Maseratis ever made -

45:02.880 --> 45:04.960
Giorgetto Giugiaro.

45:07.000 --> 45:11.840
DeLorean wanted his car to look
like nothing that had gone before.

45:11.840 --> 45:15.520
Suffice to say, Giugiaro obliged,

45:15.520 --> 45:18.720
and all DeLorean needed now
was somewhere to build it.

45:21.560 --> 45:24.640
Scouring the globe
for juicy tax breaks,

45:24.640 --> 45:27.720
he almost did a deal in Puerto Rico,

45:27.720 --> 45:31.080
but he ended up on the other side
of the Atlantic, here...

45:32.880 --> 45:34.000
..in Belfast.

45:38.480 --> 45:43.080
In the late '70s, Belfast was in the
grip of sectarian violence.

45:44.160 --> 45:46.360
The Labour government of the day

45:46.360 --> 45:49.400
reckoned that creating jobs
was key to peace.

45:49.400 --> 45:52.240
So, DeLorean was welcomed
with open arms.

45:53.640 --> 45:56.440
You know, there's complete
euphoria about this factory.

45:56.440 --> 45:57.880
In nearly every household

45:57.880 --> 45:59.520
there's an application form.

46:00.840 --> 46:03.600
Ever the optimist,
DeLorean told them

46:03.600 --> 46:06.080
he'd build a factory from scratch

46:06.080 --> 46:09.120
in a muddy bog
on the outskirts of the city,

46:09.120 --> 46:14.080
and that he'd deliver the car
to market in just two years.

46:16.040 --> 46:17.840
It was an insane timeframe -

46:17.840 --> 46:20.160
getting a car from concept
to the road

46:20.160 --> 46:21.720
normally takes about five years,

46:21.720 --> 46:24.160
and that's assuming you've got
a functioning factory

46:24.160 --> 46:25.440
and a trained workforce.

46:25.440 --> 46:27.240
DeLorean had neither.

46:29.280 --> 46:31.160
What's more, that muddy bog

46:31.160 --> 46:34.560
that the factory was to be built on
was in Dunmurry,

46:34.560 --> 46:39.760
a site sandwiched between Protestant
and Republican neighbourhoods.

46:41.160 --> 46:44.160
We adopted a positive
discrimination policy

46:44.160 --> 46:47.400
to make sure that we've got
a 50/50 workforce,

46:47.400 --> 46:51.640
and we had a workforce that worked
together alongside each other.

46:51.640 --> 46:54.760
There was not one iota of problem
inside the plant.

46:58.080 --> 47:01.440
So, improbably, the factory,
which is still here,

47:01.440 --> 47:03.880
came together with barely a hitch.

47:03.880 --> 47:07.880
The problem was, the car was nowhere
near ready to be built -

47:07.880 --> 47:10.360
but DeLorean
had a solution for that too,

47:10.360 --> 47:13.240
and it took him to the very other
side of the UK

47:13.240 --> 47:15.840
to Norfolk, the home of Lotus.

47:18.080 --> 47:21.720
Wanting his car to be as sharp
to drive as it was to look at,

47:21.720 --> 47:24.960
DeLorean turned to the best
in the business.

47:24.960 --> 47:29.160
Lotus boss, seven-time Formula 1
Constructors' Champion

47:29.160 --> 47:30.640
Colin Chapman.

47:33.880 --> 47:35.920
Colin Chapman had built up Lotus.

47:35.920 --> 47:38.520
it was selling cars
in every country in the world.

47:38.520 --> 47:41.160
There were high performance
sports cars

47:41.160 --> 47:43.480
which were acclaimed worldwide,

47:43.480 --> 47:47.080
and Colin had achieved everything
that John DeLorean wanted to be.

47:47.080 --> 47:51.040
So, he knew that if Colin Chapman
took on the job

47:51.040 --> 47:54.600
and said that he could do it,
he would do it.

47:54.600 --> 47:56.640
Chapman was soon to learn, though,

47:56.640 --> 47:58.800
that while DeLorean had been busy

47:58.800 --> 48:01.520
selling his cutting edge
sports car dream,

48:01.520 --> 48:06.400
the actual prototype
was woefully underdeveloped.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.000
It turned out

48:08.000 --> 48:09.960
it had no space
for a fuel tank,

48:09.960 --> 48:12.720
it had no space for a spare wheel.

48:12.720 --> 48:14.680
There were a number
of different things

48:14.680 --> 48:16.480
the basic packaging had to address.

48:20.120 --> 48:21.760
As luck would have it, though,

48:21.760 --> 48:24.680
Chapman already had a car
to base the DeLorean on.

48:26.080 --> 48:28.880
His world-class Lotus Esprit...

48:30.560 --> 48:34.120
..and using its chassis and a
modified fibreglass body,

48:34.120 --> 48:36.720
the new car began to take shape...

48:37.880 --> 48:40.600
..but in order to achieve
that all-essential

48:40.600 --> 48:42.800
car of the future look,

48:42.800 --> 48:46.640
DeLorean wanted that body clad
in stainless steel.

48:47.960 --> 48:50.640
In essence, it was building the same
type of car

48:50.640 --> 48:52.400
that we were used to at Lotus,

48:52.400 --> 48:54.440
but you had to finish up
with a set of panels

48:54.440 --> 48:56.280
that were all beautifully matched.

48:56.280 --> 48:59.280
That presented a huge problem
in itself.

49:03.880 --> 49:08.920
But, against all the odds, John
DeLorean and his team delivered -

49:08.920 --> 49:13.560
in January, 1981, 40 years ago,
the DeLorean landed.

49:16.640 --> 49:18.280
Sleek and sharp edged

49:18.280 --> 49:22.400
and clothed in that beautiful,
bare stainless steel,

49:22.400 --> 49:24.960
the DeLorean looked truly space age.

49:29.840 --> 49:32.680
It was an extraordinary
achievement.

49:32.680 --> 49:36.600
To this day, no car has ever reached
production faster.

49:37.920 --> 49:41.600
John DeLorean had realised
his sports car dream...

49:43.960 --> 49:46.440
..but there was just one problem.

49:48.160 --> 49:49.800
It was terrible.

49:53.280 --> 49:58.320
So bad that sitting here right now,
I don't quite know where to begin -

49:58.320 --> 50:00.600
but let's begin with the engine.

50:02.280 --> 50:06.040
DeLorean was going to use the rotary
engine from the Mazda RX-7.

50:06.040 --> 50:08.880
Cost an expediency meant he didn't.

50:08.880 --> 50:10.280
Bad decision.

50:12.120 --> 50:14.120
What he ended up with was a V6

50:14.120 --> 50:18.400
that had been jointly developed
by Renault, Peugeot and Volvo,

50:18.400 --> 50:22.880
producing a not very exotic
130 horsepower.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.160
The thing weighed quite a lot

50:26.160 --> 50:28.400
because of the
stainless steel panels,

50:28.400 --> 50:30.480
so performance was terrible.

50:30.480 --> 50:32.800
With this manual gearbox,

50:32.800 --> 50:35.280
it would do 0-60
in nine and a half seconds,

50:35.280 --> 50:37.400
but it was slower with the
three-speed automatic

50:37.400 --> 50:39.560
than most Americans wanted.

50:39.560 --> 50:42.520
So, it wasn't a performance
car at all.

50:45.200 --> 50:46.400
GRINDING

50:46.400 --> 50:47.680
Good Lord.

50:49.720 --> 50:52.200
It wasn't a very refined car,
either.

50:52.200 --> 50:54.240
In throwing it together so fast,

50:54.240 --> 50:56.920
the engineers had had to build
the DeLorean

50:56.920 --> 50:59.080
with whatever they could
lay their hands on.

51:00.280 --> 51:02.840
The brakes come from a Ford Cortina,

51:02.840 --> 51:06.000
the glove box from a Volkswagen.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.440
The door locks, Austin Allegro.

51:09.440 --> 51:12.320
Gear knob, Renault Fuego.

51:13.400 --> 51:15.600
You're not really robbing
from royalty, are you?

51:16.640 --> 51:18.760
And then there's the handling.

51:21.280 --> 51:22.560
Oh, my God.

51:24.360 --> 51:25.840
It's terrible!

51:29.400 --> 51:31.000
Halfway through the corner!

51:31.000 --> 51:33.760
If you just back off,
it wants to oversteer immediately.

51:35.240 --> 51:36.640
Wow.

51:36.640 --> 51:38.920
I mean, it's relatively
controllable,

51:38.920 --> 51:42.800
but on the public road, good God,
it's an accident waiting to happen.

51:46.200 --> 51:49.640
And it would be an expensive
accident, at that.

51:52.680 --> 51:55.840
In 1981, when this was launched
in the US,

51:55.840 --> 51:59.160
it was the same price
as a Porsche 911!

52:00.280 --> 52:03.440
DeLorean's dream of this affordable
sports car,

52:03.440 --> 52:07.120
it was over before
it had even begun.

52:07.120 --> 52:08.640
It was too expensive.

52:09.960 --> 52:13.400
But instead of stopping to work
on the car's flaws,

52:13.400 --> 52:16.760
in a move designed to show the world
that all was well,

52:16.760 --> 52:19.360
DeLorean ramped up production.

52:20.840 --> 52:23.720
This was to prove a poor decision.

52:25.560 --> 52:28.200
It was a bad time
to be launching a new car.

52:28.200 --> 52:32.800
World markets, they'd gone
to hell in a handbasket in '81.

52:32.800 --> 52:35.160
There was a massive oil crisis.

52:35.160 --> 52:39.160
There were people knifing each other
in the gas queues in Los Angeles.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.960
ARCHIVE: DeLorean sales
are falling faster than most

52:41.960 --> 52:44.720
in a thoroughly depressed
US car market.

52:44.720 --> 52:47.720
It meant, of course, that we needed
financial help again.

52:47.720 --> 52:51.240
But the political landscape
in the UK had changed.

52:51.240 --> 52:54.320
The DeLorean backing Labour
government was out,

52:54.320 --> 52:55.920
and the Conservatives were in -

52:55.920 --> 52:58.400
led by Margaret Thatcher.

52:58.400 --> 53:01.680
To say that she was unenthusiastic

53:01.680 --> 53:05.320
about putting more money in
would be an understatement.

53:05.320 --> 53:08.760
There was no way that any more money
was coming from government,

53:08.760 --> 53:12.280
so it was really down to John,
in the main,

53:12.280 --> 53:14.800
to find ways to raise investment.

53:17.480 --> 53:20.160
And things were about to get worse.

53:20.160 --> 53:23.320
In a last ditch attempt to keep
the business afloat,

53:23.320 --> 53:25.920
DeLorean started to do deals
with people

53:25.920 --> 53:28.520
you really don't want
to do deals with.

53:41.240 --> 53:43.320
In October, 1982,

53:43.320 --> 53:46.040
in a Los Angeles hotel room,

53:46.040 --> 53:49.280
John DeLorean was arrested
in an FBI drug sting...

53:50.480 --> 53:56.600
..apparently doing a deal to shift
25 kilos of cocaine.

54:07.680 --> 54:10.360
In the factory, there was a mix
of disillusionment

54:10.360 --> 54:12.840
that he could possibly have done
such a thing,

54:12.840 --> 54:16.000
but there was also this
secondary element

54:16.000 --> 54:19.640
of many of them considering John
to be the equivalent of Robin Hood,

54:19.640 --> 54:23.400
the saviour who was prepared to do
anything to salvage their job.

54:27.680 --> 54:29.640
ARCHIVE: ..the American
John DeLorean.

54:29.640 --> 54:31.360
In court this morning,
John DeLorean...

54:31.360 --> 54:33.240
At his trial two years later,

54:33.240 --> 54:36.840
DeLorean pleaded that he was
a victim of FBI entrapment.

54:36.840 --> 54:39.320
He was found not guilty.

54:40.600 --> 54:44.040
Carmaker John DeLorean has been
cleared of all charges against him

54:44.040 --> 54:46.800
at the end of his drug trafficking
trial in Los Angeles.

54:47.880 --> 54:49.600
But the damage had been done.

54:49.600 --> 54:52.760
Having built just 9,000 cars,

54:52.760 --> 54:55.720
the DeLorean Motor Company was dead.

54:57.120 --> 54:59.240
John DeLorean's dream...

55:00.440 --> 55:01.800
..was over.

55:05.640 --> 55:08.880
And that might have been that
for the DeLorean story,

55:08.880 --> 55:15.520
the car and its creator destined to
fade into obscurity -

55:15.520 --> 55:18.760
and then, a year after
DeLorean's trial...

55:20.000 --> 55:21.320
..this happened.

55:23.920 --> 55:25.680
Watch this, watch this!

55:25.680 --> 55:29.440
Back To The Future
was a global blockbuster.

55:31.120 --> 55:35.520
The time travelling DeLorean's flux
capacitor and flaming tyre trails

55:35.520 --> 55:38.800
made it an instant
Hollywood superstar.

55:41.720 --> 55:45.680
Ah! 88 miles per hour!

55:53.280 --> 55:55.400
I'm a Back To The Future obsessive.

55:55.400 --> 55:58.720
I must watch them every other
week with one of my kids.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.720
This is, for me,
the ultimate film star car.

56:05.760 --> 56:08.080
88 miles an hour was the number

56:08.080 --> 56:10.800
that just lodged
in all of our heads -

56:10.800 --> 56:12.960
and there's that famous speedometer.

56:12.960 --> 56:14.680
And, of course, it only goes to 85.

56:14.680 --> 56:17.480
I've never understood
why they did that.

56:19.040 --> 56:21.760
So, why choose the DeLorean?

56:23.320 --> 56:26.440
Well, to use the immortal
words of Dr Emmett Brown,

56:26.440 --> 56:29.480
if you're going to make a time
machine out of a car,

56:29.480 --> 56:32.680
why not do it with some style?

56:32.680 --> 56:33.840
What a line.

56:38.880 --> 56:42.920
Ironically, had Back To The Future
arrived a bit sooner

56:42.920 --> 56:45.160
in the space time continuum,

56:45.160 --> 56:48.840
it might actually have saved
the DeLorean.

56:48.840 --> 56:54.120
As it was, this most famous of cars
will go down in history

56:54.120 --> 56:59.480
as a victim of bad luck,
bad timing and a bad boy boss.

57:03.400 --> 57:06.080
But you know what?
When you're driving this car,

57:06.080 --> 57:07.640
none of it really matters,

57:07.640 --> 57:10.240
because it's instantly recognisable.

57:10.240 --> 57:12.640
Even 40 years after it was launched,

57:12.640 --> 57:15.400
people know exactly what it is -

57:15.400 --> 57:20.360
and 40 years from now, they'll still
know exactly what it is,

57:20.360 --> 57:23.760
because it's the time machine.

57:30.800 --> 57:34.680
In fact, perhaps John DeLorean
did build a car

57:34.680 --> 57:37.400
that would live forever -

57:37.400 --> 57:40.480
just not quite the way he imagined.

57:47.640 --> 57:49.400
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

57:53.200 --> 57:55.720
The most recognisable
film car of all.

57:58.960 --> 58:00.240
Amazing story.

58:01.600 --> 58:03.640
Amazing eyebrows.  Oh, yeah.

58:03.640 --> 58:05.240
And what a chin!

58:05.240 --> 58:08.120
I can't believe how futuristic
it looks, even now.  Yeah.

58:08.120 --> 58:09.440
I don't know they did it!

58:09.440 --> 58:12.480
I reckon they shaved a bit
round here and then reshaped it.

58:14.960 --> 58:17.000
It's the car, not the chin.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.400
Oh! Sorry, sorry.

58:18.400 --> 58:21.320
All right, then, I suppose if you
want attention outside Harrods,

58:21.320 --> 58:24.120
forget your Bugattis
and your Paganis -

58:24.120 --> 58:28.000
get yourself a failure from Belfast
made out of old Lotus bits.

58:28.000 --> 58:31.760
And no question, the second
greatest movie car of all time.

58:31.760 --> 58:33.400
Oh, don't even go there!

58:33.400 --> 58:35.040
It's the greatest.  Excuse me.  Yeah?

58:35.040 --> 58:37.240
James Bond, DB5.

58:37.240 --> 58:39.040
Oh, relax, lads, relax.

58:39.040 --> 58:40.840
What about Herbie?

58:40.840 --> 58:43.280
Ooh, Herbie!  Show a bit of love
for the Bug!  Herbie!

58:43.280 --> 58:44.880
Does the DB5 have a flux capacitor?

58:44.880 --> 58:46.520
Does Herbie have a flux capacitor?

58:46.520 --> 58:47.840
No. Game over.

58:47.840 --> 58:50.920
Listen, you go back in time
every time you open your wardrobe

58:50.920 --> 58:53.040
to the '70s, by the looks of things!

58:53.040 --> 58:55.680
You should go back in time
and visit your hair.

58:55.680 --> 58:57.560
It comes back!

58:57.560 --> 58:59.320
No need for that.

58:59.320 --> 59:01.840
We must leave it there,
because we're out of time.

59:01.840 --> 59:04.520
Next week, it's all about the youth

59:04.520 --> 59:08.240
as we try to find the best first
cars for brand-new drivers.

59:08.240 --> 59:09.920
We're going to need
a TikTok account.

59:09.920 --> 59:12.000
Thanks so much for watching.
Goodnight.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.240
How dare you?
