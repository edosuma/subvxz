00:01.080 --> 00:02.081
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.160 --> 00:05.960
Your daughter has drawn a
very unusual combination of symbols-

00:08.080 --> 00:09.923
Can you tell me where
the tunnel is? No.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.445
Something is starting.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.329
It's something
that's not real yet.

00:13.400 --> 00:14.845
Something that's
going to happen?

00:14.920 --> 00:17.160
Do you know where? DIANA:
Through the hole in the mirror.

00:17.440 --> 00:20.444
I don't think we have a lot of
time left before it gets here.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.162
You think it's all mirrors
Eve can't look into,

00:32.240 --> 00:33.651
or just certain mirrors?

00:33.760 --> 00:36.240
Well, she saw this skull guy
in the hand mirror at the shop

00:36.320 --> 00:37.924
and the mirror in Nick's loft.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.083
So if it's trying to kill Eve,
we're not taking any chances.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.256
So what is she supposed to do?

00:42.280 --> 00:43.884
Avoid mirrors for
the rest of her life?

00:43.960 --> 00:46.440
For right now, yes.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.160
And what if it's
not just mirrors?

00:49.280 --> 00:50.441
What are you talking about?

00:50.520 --> 00:52.727
Well, what if she catches
her reflection in a window,

00:52.800 --> 00:54.370
or, like, a china cabinet?

00:54.440 --> 00:57.250
Is this skull freak going to
pull her through those, too?

00:57.320 --> 00:58.656
Let's just stick to
mirrors right now.

00:58.680 --> 00:59.760
All right, we got this one,

00:59.800 --> 01:02.121
the one in the guest room,
the one in the bathroom.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.611
Am I missing any?

01:03.680 --> 01:06.001
I gotta be honest, I'm nervous.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.925
Yeah. Me, too.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.296
I know we're doing the right thing
by letting Eve stay here...

01:10.320 --> 01:11.890
She has nowhere else to go.
I know.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.327
And I'm not saying I don't
want to help Eve, okay?

01:14.400 --> 01:17.563
I'm just saying I'm worried about
bringing this into our home.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.256
What if it does something
to hurt our babies?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.850
Like pull you
through the mirror.

01:21.320 --> 01:24.847
It's a threat to all of us. We have
to do everything we can to stop it.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.845
But if it messes with my family,

01:27.920 --> 01:30.605
I will rip its green,
ugly eyeballs out.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.322
I know one thing's for sure.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.606
What?

01:40.680 --> 01:44.241
I'm gonna have some seriously
bad hair days for a while.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.244
I hope this is
still an okay time.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.056
Yeah, the kids are asleep.
Do you want some wine?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.127
No, thanks.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.804
So what did you
need my help with?

01:55.960 --> 01:58.440
I need to understand
how these mirrors work.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.522
You mean about
what you saw in them?

02:01.240 --> 02:02.730
I mean how to go through them.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.444
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.484
This skull thing
tried to grab me

02:08.560 --> 02:10.402
and pull me into
wherever it was.

02:10.479 --> 02:11.845
And it almost killed you.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.696
I think it will kill me if I
don't do anything about it.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.882
So maybe you should
stay away from it.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.483
Nick saw it, too.
What if it comes after him?

02:18.560 --> 02:19.856
I thought it went
away when Nick saw it.

02:19.880 --> 02:20.881
Mmm-mmm. No.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.816
We don't really know
for sure what it was doing.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.649
Have you talked
to Nick about this?

02:24.720 --> 02:26.404
No, I don't wanna
talk to him about it

02:26.480 --> 02:28.680
until I have a better handle
on what we're dealing with.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.722
You can't do this by yourself.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.006
That's why I'm here.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.447
Your mother had more
knowledge than either of us.

02:35.520 --> 02:36.931
Yeah, and look where it got her.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.490
She ever mention anything to you

02:38.560 --> 02:43.646
about portals to another world
or moving through mirrors?

02:44.600 --> 02:48.605
Uh, no, but, I mean, there was
a lot we didn't talk about.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.250
For the record,
not a great mother.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.731
Do you still have
any of her books?

02:53.080 --> 02:54.969
I do.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.485
But... Please.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.891
There might be something in them

02:58.960 --> 03:00.360
that could help us
fight this thing.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.721
Those books could
be just as dangerous.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.691
Waiting for this thing to come after
me, or us, would be more dangerous.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.809
And, Adalind, I think one of the
reasons it is connecting to me

03:09.880 --> 03:11.848
is because I can
see those symbols.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.249
Diana can see the symbols, too.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.049
I know. That's why
we can't wait.

03:17.120 --> 03:20.090
We have to find
this thing and kill it.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.129
I'll get the books.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.486
Guess we'll start with you.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.484
You haven't been opened
in a while, have you?

03:55.920 --> 03:57.285
Mirrors.

04:02.760 --> 04:03.960
You said you liked this place.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Idol.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.168
But I always end up
eating way too much.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.163
The crème brûlée
was not my idea.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.402
Yeah, but how good was that?

04:11.520 --> 04:13.761
You stay here. You've been
in those heels all day.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.080
I'll get the car.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.288
Oh! My swollen feet salute you.

04:37.480 --> 04:38.720
Hey. Hi.

04:38.840 --> 04:39.921
What are you doing up?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.126
Waiting for you.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.567
You hungry?
I can make you something.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.162
No, I had a sandwich earlier.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.685
Eve came by.

04:49.360 --> 04:50.441
Eve? What did she want?

04:51.200 --> 04:53.567
For me to help her
find a Hexenbiest way

04:53.640 --> 04:55.927
to go through the mirror
into the other place.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.206
Is that even possible?

04:57.520 --> 05:00.490
I don't know. She wanted to
borrow my mom's spell books.

05:00.560 --> 05:01.800
And you gave them to her?

05:01.880 --> 05:02.927
Yes.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.696
But I'm worried she's gonna
try to do this on her own.

05:04.720 --> 05:05.926
Is that what she said?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.365
Not exactly,

05:07.440 --> 05:10.842
but she's really worried that this
skull thing is gonna come after her,

05:10.920 --> 05:14.163
after you, even Diana,
not to mention the rest of us.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.323
I think Eve's looking
for a little redemption.

05:17.560 --> 05:18.607
Aren't we all?

05:19.240 --> 05:21.163
Do you think there's
anything in those books

05:21.240 --> 05:23.288
that could get her
into the other place?

05:23.360 --> 05:24.521
They're my mom's books.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.170
I haven't read
through all of them,

05:26.240 --> 05:28.481
and I've never
crossed through a mirror,

05:28.560 --> 05:31.006
but I know enough to know
that anything is possible.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.206
I need to talk to her.

05:32.280 --> 05:33.964
I was hoping you'd say that.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.767
Hank.

05:37.840 --> 05:38.841
Nick, we got a body.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.843
Okay, I'll pick you up.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.841
I'm sorry.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.136
Just make sure you talk to Eve.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.321
Yes, I will.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.607
Victim is Maddie Simms.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.808
No bullet wounds,
no knife wounds.

05:49.880 --> 05:50.961
Wesen?

05:51.040 --> 05:52.963
That's where I was going.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.206
That's Maddie's car.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.408
Her friend was waiting for her
to take said car around

05:56.480 --> 05:59.086
to Cafe Nell's down on Kearney
where they had dined alone.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.606
FYI, Nell's does an amazing
Linguini and clams.

06:01.680 --> 06:02.681
We know.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.364
Afraid there were no witnesses.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.010
When Maddie didn't
return with the car,

06:06.080 --> 06:07.136
her friend went looking for her.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.207
Found her like this.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.884
I assume that's her
friend in your car?

06:09.960 --> 06:11.200
You assume correctly.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.442
Her wallet's here.
Credit cards, cash.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.688
And the car's still here,
so it wasn't a robbery,

06:15.760 --> 06:18.127
unless there was 30 pounds
of cocaine in the trunk.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.202
But it is definitely Wesen.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.442
Let's go see if
her friend is Wesen.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.522
Her name's Allie Stevens.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.601
Allie.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.967
I'm Detective Griffin.
My partner, Nick Burkhardt.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.801
She was just getting the car.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.281
Who would do a thing like this?

06:36.800 --> 06:38.856
Do you know of anybody who
might want to hurt Maddie?

06:38.880 --> 06:41.360
No. Maddie got
along with everybody.

06:41.440 --> 06:42.965
No problems at home, work?

06:43.040 --> 06:44.405
Not at all.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.968
She was in a great mood.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.168
I can't believe this is happening.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.686
Did you see anybody follow
her out of the restaurant?

06:52.720 --> 06:54.688
What they did to her...

06:54.760 --> 06:56.524
I can't believe it.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.247
I can't believe it.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.650
She can go. Yeah.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.769
Is there somebody
who can come get you?

07:04.840 --> 07:06.205
No Woge?

07:06.320 --> 07:07.970
And there's no
blood on her clothes.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.044
So this line of questioning
is getting us no place.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.760
Her sister's coming to get her.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.176
All right,
see if there's surveillance

07:15.200 --> 07:16.576
that covers
the route that Maddie took

07:16.600 --> 07:18.443
between the restaurant
and her car.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.763
There's a bank on the corner,
might show something.

07:25.240 --> 07:29.131
I used to run so fast when
I was younger. Mmm-hmm.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.531
So fast.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.160
So fast.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.646
I know, Mrs. Cutler,
you sure did.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.290
And I want to run again.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.646
On.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.166
Well, we can't go run now,
it's too dark outside.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.083
Oh, through the woods,

07:42.160 --> 07:43.491
I remember the trees.

07:43.560 --> 07:44.971
There were so many trees.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.485
So many trees.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.562
Here we go.
Let's get you inside.

07:48.680 --> 07:51.570
And they could never run
faster than us. Uh-huh.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.925
There you go.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.524
Nurse Barton will be in to
help you get in bed, okay?

07:58.600 --> 08:02.082
Anything else you need?
Maybe some water?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.002
Who are you?

08:07.080 --> 08:09.080
I'm your friend, Mason,
who helps take care of you.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.167
Remember?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.206
On.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.921
I remember the sweet taste
of blood in my mouth.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.843
Well, that's a new one.

08:17.920 --> 08:20.241
Let's not get too worked up now, Mrs.
Cutler.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.688
I'll be back tomorrow, okay?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.889
We always caught them.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.411
I'm sure you did.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.806
I'll get you an extra blanket.
It's cold out tonight.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.801
Mason!

08:45.920 --> 08:47.524
What are you doing?

08:47.640 --> 08:49.404
- What the hell was that? What was it?
- Oh!

08:49.480 --> 08:51.209
Get out! Did you see it?

08:51.280 --> 08:52.645
Did you see it? Get out!

08:52.760 --> 08:53.761
Mason, I'm hurt.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.887
Stay away from me!

08:54.960 --> 08:56.405
I need help in here now!

09:10.160 --> 09:12.731
Maddie Simms has
no criminal record.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.051
She's been working at the same advertising
agency for the last four years.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.296
And none of the prints from the
scene match anything in the system.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.401
So we've got nothing.

09:21.480 --> 09:22.891
Well, I got something.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.850
Similar attack in
North Precinct 10 days ago.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.689
A guy walking home
from the grocery store

09:27.800 --> 09:29.564
was torn up just
like Maddie Simms.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.291
Happened at night, on a
dark street, no witnesses.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.771
No evidence left behind.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.842
Listed as a mauling, turned
over to Animal Control.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.967
We know differently.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.121
Yes, we do.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.296
Surveillance from
the bank camera.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.721
Not much, but it's all we got.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.524
There she is.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.726
And she's gone.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.849
Her car was around the
corner two blocks up,

09:50.920 --> 09:53.161
which, I'm sure you've noted,
cannot be seen from here.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.882
And nobody walks by for the next
two minutes and 32 seconds.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.247
If she was being followed, it
wasn't from the restaurant.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.656
Let's see if they
have any surveillance

10:02.680 --> 10:04.409
from the North Precinct case.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.686
What North Precinct case?

10:05.760 --> 10:08.331
Ten days ago. Body found
in the same condition.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.131
Case number A91432.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.361
Check everything they've got.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.640
See if we're missing anything.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.047
Yeah, like the murderer.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.205
So, whatever Wesen is doing this

10:18.280 --> 10:19.964
isn't taking
the money or the meat.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.565
Maybe it's doing it for sport.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.929
Then it'll do it again.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.201
Eve?

10:46.160 --> 10:48.083
Nick, yeah, I'm here.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.011
Everything okay? Yeah.

10:50.080 --> 10:52.003
Adalind told me you took
some of her mom's books.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.050
You think there's a Hexenbiest
way into this other world?

10:55.120 --> 10:56.485
I think we have
to try to find out.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.848
Yes, "we" is a very good idea.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.536
Look, I don't even know
if I'm going to find anything.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.891
I just started on
the second book,

11:02.960 --> 11:06.646
and so far nothing
about mirrors as portals

11:06.720 --> 11:08.882
or gateways to anywhere.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.496
So if you're worried
about me, don't be.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.727
Yes, I'm very worried about you.

11:13.440 --> 11:17.490
Nick, we're the only two people
who have seen this thing.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.289
If we don't find
a way to get to it,

11:19.360 --> 11:21.089
it will find a way to get to us.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.611
Just don't do it alone.

11:22.680 --> 11:23.761
Okay?

11:24.800 --> 11:28.282
Believe me, this is not
something I want to do alone.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.405
Okay-

11:32.040 --> 11:33.530
Well, I, uh...

11:35.280 --> 11:37.009
I think you ought
to get some sleep.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.048
Thanks for checking up on me.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.645
I hope I don't
have to bleed on this.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.807
Maybe if I just...

12:01.680 --> 12:03.205
That's better.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.931
"Hexes, curses, charms."

12:07.000 --> 12:09.810
"Merseburg incantations."

12:43.360 --> 12:45.283
As if we don't have
enough on our plate,

12:45.360 --> 12:47.886
Mrs. Margaret Cutler,
91 years young,

12:47.960 --> 12:49.644
died in her sleep last night.

12:49.720 --> 12:51.165
And we're here because“.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.176
Because although technically
she died in her sleep,

12:53.200 --> 12:54.770
according to Nurse Barton,

12:54.840 --> 12:57.366
she was assaulted by an
orderly named Mason Wilcox.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.886
Mr. Wilcox was
arrested about an hour later.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.806
Bruises on her neck,
I assume from the attack.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.120
Yeah. That's what I was told.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.248
Any witnesses?
Just Nurse Barton.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.163
She found Mrs. Cutler
deceased this morning.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.480
We need to talk with the nurse.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.376
And let's find out where
the orderly's being held.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.561
Yeah.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.245
Nurse Barton.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.976
I'm Detective Burkhardt. This is
my partner, Detective Griffin.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.200
Can you tell us what happened?

13:21.680 --> 13:24.729
Mason Wilcox killed her,
that's what happened.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.850
You saw him attack her? Yes.

13:26.920 --> 13:27.921
When I walked in,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.571
he had her up against the wall
with his hands around her neck.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.644
Do you have any idea
why he would do this?

13:33.720 --> 13:36.371
There's no reason to attack
any of our patients,

13:36.440 --> 13:38.169
especially Mrs. Cutler.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.881
I mean, she was 91 years old. She could
barely get out of bed by herself.

13:41.960 --> 13:43.644
How long has Mr. Wilcox
been working here?

13:45.040 --> 13:47.691
Uh, three, four years.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.127
Have you had any problems
with this orderly before?

13:50.200 --> 13:51.200
Never

13:51.240 --> 13:53.686
I mean, it's not an easy job,

13:53.760 --> 13:56.843
but there is no excuse
for what he did.

13:56.920 --> 14:00.129
My first thought was maybe
he was high on something.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.521
When he was being arrested,
he was yelling that,

14:02.600 --> 14:04.887
"Mrs. Cutler was a monster,"
and that she attacked him.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.450
I mean, that's absurd.

14:08.600 --> 14:11.683
Who examined Mrs. Cutler
just after the attack?

14:11.760 --> 14:13.888
Dr. Landeaux was on call.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.850
He said that her
injuries were superficial,

14:16.960 --> 14:19.531
but I know they were
more emotional than physical.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.206
Mason Wilcox scared
that poor woman to death

14:22.280 --> 14:23.600
and he's not
getting away with it.

14:23.640 --> 14:24.846
Where's Dr. Landeaux now?

14:24.920 --> 14:26.960
He's here. He had to continue
on his morning rounds.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.136
He said to page him
when you want him.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.241
We want him.

14:29.320 --> 14:32.449
Mrs. Cutler was suffering
from severe dementia.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.921
She was becoming
restless in recent weeks.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.002
I changed her meds to try
to make her comfortable,

14:37.080 --> 14:39.176
but there's only so much
we can do at a certain point.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.124
Has she ever exhibited
any violent behavior?

14:42.240 --> 14:44.607
Aggressive
behavior is not uncommon

14:44.680 --> 14:47.331
in later stages of
Alzheimer's or dementia,

14:47.400 --> 14:49.562
and it can be very
frustrating for caregivers.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.728
So she might have attacked him?
Possible.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.325
Could Mrs. Cutler have sustained

14:53.400 --> 14:55.846
any internal injuries as
a result of the attack?

14:55.920 --> 14:57.524
When I examined her
after the incident,

14:57.600 --> 15:00.410
her vital signs were good and she
said she wasn't in any pain.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.800
Do you think the orderly had
anything to do with her death?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.002
Personally, I don't.

15:08.080 --> 15:11.846
Given her age and condition, I
think she died of natural causes.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.360
Thanks, Doctor.
That's all we need for now.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.887
Of course. Let me know if
you need anything else.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.490
The orderly attacks a 90-year-old
woman claiming she's a monster.

15:22.560 --> 15:23.607
Do we think she's Wesen?

15:23.680 --> 15:26.296
It would explain why she attacked the
orderly and why he attacked her.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.924
Well, it puts
the orderly in a bad spot.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.416
No way he can
prove what he's saying.

15:29.440 --> 15:30.487
We order an autopsy.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.166
If she sustained any internal
damage, then it's manslaughter.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.608
Well, best-case scenario, he's
still facing assault charges.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.841
Let's talk to the orderly.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.680
You want to tell me about the stuff
our daughter has been drawing?

15:41.400 --> 15:43.243
I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.606
Oh, no?

15:44.680 --> 15:46.091
Then I'm on my way over.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.976
We could sit Diana down and we
can talk about those symbols-

15:48.000 --> 15:49.843
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.336
We don't have to put
her through all of that.

15:51.360 --> 15:52.486
What do the symbols mean?

15:53.360 --> 15:54.441
I don't know.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.601
And I think you're lying.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.842
I don't care what you
think, Sean-I don't know.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.085
I wanna see the tunnel.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.005
Damn it, Adalind, our daughter is
in the center of something big.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.491
You think I don't know that?

16:07.560 --> 16:09.120
Then I need to know
everything you know.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.089
Now tell me
where that tunnel is.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.131
You're gonna have to
take that up with Nick.

16:16.520 --> 16:17.726
Good-bye.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.166
Mason Wilcox?

16:30.040 --> 16:31.166
Portland PD.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.606
Really?

16:45.480 --> 16:47.164
Cool it, man. Cool it.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.167
Don't move, Mason.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.844
I didn't kill her.
Then Why'd you run?

16:51.920 --> 16:53.016
Don't you know we hate that?

16:53.040 --> 16:54.485
I didn't kill her!

16:59.120 --> 17:01.361
You heard Mrs. Cutler
died last night.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.680
Guessing that's why you ran.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.046
It's not what you think.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.359
Then tell us.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.441
I want a lawyer.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.523
If the autopsy proves she died
from anything you did to her,

17:09.599 --> 17:11.045
you will go to jail, Mason.

17:11.119 --> 17:12.884
Now, we talked to Dr. Landeaux.

17:12.960 --> 17:17.249
He told us she was suffering from
dementia and she could become violent.

17:17.319 --> 17:19.367
And your record

17:19.440 --> 17:21.016
doesn't suggest you like
assaulting people.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.040
I don't.

17:22.119 --> 17:23.281
Then tell us what happened.

17:23.800 --> 17:24.881
You wouldn't believe me.

17:24.960 --> 17:28.885
You said she was a monster,

17:28.960 --> 17:30.803
and she attacked you, right?

17:31.480 --> 17:34.563
Look, I was helping
her back to her room.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.130
She was telling
me some crazy story

17:36.240 --> 17:37.336
about running through the woods

17:37.360 --> 17:39.442
and tasting blood in her mouth.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.602
I never took her seriously.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.091
I was getting her a blanket

17:43.160 --> 17:44.616
and the next thing
I knew, I was being

17:44.640 --> 17:46.483
attacked by some
kind of monster.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.927
I don't use drugs.
I never used steroids.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.240
I know what I saw.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.606
Then tell us what you saw.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.241
Fine.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.845
You wanna hear?

17:55.360 --> 17:59.649
It had yellow eyes,
hair everywhere,

17:59.720 --> 18:02.803
and came at me with teeth
like some kind of wild dog.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.006
Then what happened?

18:04.440 --> 18:05.965
I fought back.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.927
I pushed it up against the wall,

18:10.000 --> 18:12.241
and then it turned
back into Mrs. Cutler.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.805
And that's when
the nurse showed up?

18:13.880 --> 18:17.646
Look, I know it sounds insane,
but I'm telling you the truth.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.366
I've taken care of Mrs.
Cutler for three years.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.565
She was my friend.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.846
Why would I hurt her?

18:26.880 --> 18:28.370
I believe you, Mason.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.600
We'll see what we can do.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.321
What?

18:33.720 --> 18:34.960
Really?

18:40.840 --> 18:43.047
She Woged and he freaked.
It was self-defense.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.696
Well, our testimony
is not gonna help him.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.136
We're gonna have to
help him make a case

18:46.160 --> 18:48.766
that Mrs. Cutler's attack was
so unexpected and so violent

18:48.880 --> 18:50.166
that his response could have
been

18:50.240 --> 18:51.685
nothing but self-defense.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.091
Burkhardt.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.804
Be there in 10.

18:55.880 --> 18:57.723
M.E. wants to show us something.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.764
You're gonna
make me work for it.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.642
Okay, Diana, make sure your
brother doesn't fall off the bed-

19:50.760 --> 19:53.491
Oh, and no making him float, either!

19:57.480 --> 19:59.164
Eve. Did you find something?

19:59.240 --> 20:00.536
Could you tell me
more about Blood Magic?

20:00.560 --> 20:02.096
'Cause it says
in one of your mother's books

20:02.120 --> 20:05.681
that blood is associated with
crossing over in death,

20:05.760 --> 20:07.364
like slain warriors
on the battlefield,

20:07.440 --> 20:10.091
or a hunter's prey
in its final state,

20:10.160 --> 20:11.400
human sacrifice on the altar.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.205
And sometimes blood
is used as currency.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.520
Eve, slow down.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.841
Or what if blood could be
used as a form of payment

20:17.920 --> 20:19.331
to pass into the other world?

20:19.920 --> 20:22.127
Blood Magic is very dangerous.

20:22.240 --> 20:24.971
We would only need to use it
to get to the other side.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.850
Okay, say you get to the other side.
What if you can't get back?

20:28.240 --> 20:29.730
Would it work?

20:29.960 --> 20:31.485
I don't know.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.124
Okay, thanks. I'll keep looking.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.246
Some localized bruising,

20:55.320 --> 20:57.368
consistent with what was
detailed in the report.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.816
There was a contusion
on the back of her head,

20:58.840 --> 21:00.171
but no bleeding in the brain.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.936
Mrs. Cutler had a healthy
heart in spite of her age.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.440
So no indication of
physical confrontation

21:04.520 --> 21:05.776
with the orderly
could have caused her death.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.768
Not based on the physical
evidence I have.

21:07.840 --> 21:08.921
Okay. Thank you.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.286
However,

21:12.240 --> 21:15.961
I found an extraordinarily high level
of hyaluronidase in her system.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.041
What's that?

21:17.120 --> 21:18.531
Something found in bug saliva.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.568
I had to look it up,
having never seen it before.

21:20.640 --> 21:24.008
It's from an insect commonly
known as the assassin bug.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.811
They use hyaluronidase
along with other enzymes

21:26.880 --> 21:29.884
to create a lethal saliva-cocktail
that kills its victims.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.610
And by victims,
you mean other bugs.

21:32.720 --> 21:33.767
Of course.

21:33.880 --> 21:36.008
How did it get into her system?
No idea.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.640
Could someone have
injected her with it?

21:37.920 --> 21:40.376
I'm not sure how many assassin
bugs you'd have to have access to,

21:40.400 --> 21:41.520
but I suppose it's possible.

21:41.560 --> 21:42.561
Is that what killed her?

21:42.640 --> 21:44.608
It's not normally
toxic to humans,

21:44.680 --> 21:46.728
but with this amount, who knows?

21:46.800 --> 21:48.056
I suppose if any
place was gonna have

21:48.080 --> 21:49.576
a giant assassin bug,
it'd be Portland.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.761
Hmm.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.126
No way.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.007
Hi, Mrs. Stanton.
How've you been?

22:22.200 --> 22:23.850
Oh, you know, okay.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.968
I guess the melatonin
is helping you sleep?

22:27.640 --> 22:29.369
That's kind of a lot.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.560
You sure you need this much?

22:30.600 --> 22:33.524
Oh, you don't wanna take too
much melatonin, Mrs. Stanton.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.125
Trust me.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.525
No more than two
milligrams a night

22:37.600 --> 22:38.840
without talking to your doctor.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.405
I know, Rosalee. It's just...

22:40.480 --> 22:43.290
It's a little hard
to get out these days.

22:43.360 --> 22:44.930
I understand. Yeah.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.968
Be sure and say hi
to Mr. Stanton from us.

22:49.400 --> 22:51.120
Is there something
else I can help you with?

22:51.240 --> 22:52.730
No. Thanks.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.245
Can you put that on my bill?

22:54.320 --> 22:55.321
Of course.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.731
And remember, we do deliver.

22:56.800 --> 22:57.961
I know.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.803
Getting old is no fun.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.843
Then I guess we're
not having any fun

23:08.920 --> 23:11.082
'cause we're
gettin' old together.

23:12.640 --> 23:16.247
"But one man loved
the pilgrim soul in you."

23:16.320 --> 23:19.130
"And loved the sorrows
of your changing face."

23:19.680 --> 23:20.727
You just make that up?

23:20.800 --> 23:21.800
Yep-

23:21.840 --> 23:23.171
No, it's Yeats.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.485
It's beautiful.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.125
My face is changing?

23:30.200 --> 23:31.406
What? No, not at all.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.926
Hmm. It's just a poem.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.610
Hey, guys. What's up? Hey.

23:35.680 --> 23:36.920
Just got back from the M.E.'s.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.049
We got a dead body full of an
enzyme called "hyaluronidase."

23:40.120 --> 23:41.724
It's something
found in bug saliva.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.536
Hoping you might know
of a Wesen that uses it

23:43.560 --> 23:45.847
to kill its victims.

23:47.520 --> 23:48.851
Did we catch you at a bad time?

23:49.360 --> 23:51.203
No. No, not at all.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.210
Then what's up?

23:53.840 --> 23:55.490
Well, it's...

23:57.600 --> 23:59.160
It sounds like you
could be dealing with

23:59.200 --> 24:01.601
something called a Gevatter Tod.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.125
A Godfather of Death.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.964
That does not sound good.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.811
Anything else?

24:09.880 --> 24:12.406
I think you gotta
let this one go, Nick.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.801
Trust me, this is not
a police matter.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.120
What are you talking about?

24:16.200 --> 24:19.204
We've got a dead 91-year-old
lady filled with bug saliva.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.691
The victim was Wesen, right?

24:20.760 --> 24:22.000
Suffering from dementia?

24:23.760 --> 24:25.046
All right, what's going on here?

24:28.200 --> 24:29.611
Let's go back here.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.810
Listen, dementia in
the Wesen community

24:40.880 --> 24:43.042
can be even more
difficult than normal.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.920
Some Wesen who suffer from it
experience uncontrolled Woges.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.968
Bad for them, bad for us.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.405
Bad for everybody.

24:50.480 --> 24:54.246
To protect the Wesen community,
a Gevatter Tod is called.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.810
And they...

24:55.880 --> 24:59.851
Well, they inject the Wesen suffering
from dementia with their saliva...

25:00.680 --> 25:02.967
Ending their life painlessly
and more peacefully

25:03.040 --> 25:04.451
than might otherwise happen.

25:04.520 --> 25:07.171
Considering how throughout
history we've been stoned,

25:07.240 --> 25:09.686
beheaded, bludgeoned,
what, drawn and quartered?

25:09.760 --> 25:10.886
Am I forgetting anything?

25:10.960 --> 25:12.007
They get the picture.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.523
So, who contacts
this Godfather of Death?

25:16.600 --> 25:18.284
Usually it's the family.

25:18.360 --> 25:21.409
If they don't have family, then often
it's a Wesen who cares for them.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.324
This isn't exactly something
you put in a living will.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.801
Monroe and I made
an agreement that

25:26.920 --> 25:28.490
if one of us is
suffering from dementia,

25:28.560 --> 25:30.642
the other will
contact the Gevatter Tod.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.370
You serious? Oh, yeah.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.046
It's a commitment we
made to each other.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.964
It's how Wesen have stayed
in secret for so long.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.361
I know it sounds callous, but
it's how our community works.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.647
And you know this Gevatter Tod?

25:43.960 --> 25:45.007
No.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.531
Do you know how to make contact?

25:46.600 --> 25:47.965
Yeah, we do.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.407
But, and this is a really...

25:52.480 --> 25:54.130
This is a big but,

25:54.240 --> 25:56.527
we cannot tell you who it is

25:56.600 --> 25:58.887
unless you promise not
to arrest him, or her.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.691
Monroe, we have
a nursing home orderly

26:01.760 --> 26:05.003
who could go to jail
for murder of this old woman.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.366
We need to talk to this person.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.329
Then give us your word.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.842
Yeah, yes, you have our word.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.889
Every Wesen apothecary
has this contact number.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.816
Are you sure you
want me to do this?

26:29.840 --> 26:30.921
Yes.

26:39.520 --> 26:40.931
Stay by your phone.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.890
I will return your
call within a few hours.

26:44.280 --> 26:45.805
That's how it works.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.640
It's Wu.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.407
Yeah, what've you got?

26:51.480 --> 26:53.130
Something you and
Hank need to see.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.362
We'll be right there. Yep.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.291
We've gotta go,

26:57.360 --> 26:59.010
but call us as soon
as you hear back.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.688
I hope we're
doing the right thing.

27:06.760 --> 27:10.048
A Gevatter Tod and a
Grimm in the same room?

27:10.120 --> 27:11.724
I mean, that could
get ugly fast.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.724
Take a look at this.

27:20.720 --> 27:24.566
Here's the surveillance footage from
the night Maddie Simms was killed.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.688
Here's Maddie Simms
walking to her car.

27:26.760 --> 27:27.856
We've already been through this.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.087
Well, yeah, you might
want to take another look.

27:30.160 --> 27:33.926
Once I show you this footage
from the North Precinct.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.056
Guy with the groceries
was killed 10 days ago,

27:37.080 --> 27:39.128
body torn up just
like Maddie Simms.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.202
All right. What am I missing?

27:50.920 --> 27:53.002
Coincidence? I think not.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.924
The old man was within one
block of both crime scenes.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.525
Hope we can ID this guy.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.807
Hey, Nick. I need to
see you in my office.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.162
Keep working on it. Yeah.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.521
What now?

28:11.440 --> 28:13.488
I want to see the tunnel
where these symbols are.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.056
I want to know what
the hell is going on,

28:19.080 --> 28:20.736
and why my daughter is involved
in something dangerous.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.171
Who told you it was dangerous?

28:22.240 --> 28:23.696
You show me the tunnel
and I'll tell you.

28:23.720 --> 28:25.529
No. It's not
gonna happen that way.

28:25.640 --> 28:28.041
This is my daughter
we're talking about.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.565
And you're putting her at risk.

28:29.640 --> 28:33.770
Share what you know,
I'll do the same.

28:44.080 --> 28:47.562
Maybe this guy won't call back and
we won't have to deal with any of this.

28:47.640 --> 28:51.690
I remember my father calling the
Gevatter Tod for my grandfather.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.490
Are you serious?

28:53.640 --> 28:55.404
Mmm-hmm. How old were you?

28:55.640 --> 28:58.086
Mmm, five, six maybe?

28:58.160 --> 28:59.161
Wow.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.416
I was supposed to be in bed, but
I heard the front door open,

29:01.440 --> 29:04.171
so I snuck downstairs

29:04.240 --> 29:08.211
and saw this strange man
come into our home

29:08.280 --> 29:11.682
and go into my grandfather's
room, open the window...

29:12.680 --> 29:14.205
To let the spirit out.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.609
Then he shut the door.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.685
My parents
stayed in the hallway,

29:20.760 --> 29:23.047
and my mother started bawling.

29:23.920 --> 29:25.729
And then they hugged.

29:25.800 --> 29:27.848
That's a lot for
a little kid to digest.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.490
Yeah.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.010
This could be it.

29:36.240 --> 29:37.480
I'm gonna put it on speaker.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.401
Hello?

29:40.480 --> 29:41.925
With whom am I speaking?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.445
Rosalee Calvert.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.205
Is it a parent or
a loved one in need?

29:46.880 --> 29:47.961
It's my husband.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.176
His dementia is getting worse,

29:49.200 --> 29:50.696
and he's Woged when he
shouldn't be Woging,

29:50.720 --> 29:51.816
and we really need your help.

29:51.840 --> 29:52.921
What's your address?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.321
418 Ravens View Drive.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.084
He didn't say when
he was coming over.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.536
Do you think he's
coming over right now?

30:05.560 --> 30:07.847
I don't know, it sounds like it.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.410
We gotta get Nick over here!

30:11.520 --> 30:12.601
Still can't see his face.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.166
That is the best we got.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.526
Then we got nothing.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.720
Hey, we know we're looking
for an old guy with a cane.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.370
Which is basically nothing.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.404
We may have to wait for another attack.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.160
Monroe, you hear anything back?

30:28.200 --> 30:29.645
Nick, you gotta
get over here quick.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.688
We think the Gevatter Tod
is on his way.

30:31.760 --> 30:34.730
And Rosalee kind of told him that it
was me that she was worried about,

30:34.800 --> 30:35.936
which means he's
coming over to kill me.

30:35.960 --> 30:36.961
On our way.

30:37.840 --> 30:38.920
We have to get to Monroe's.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.165
It's going to be okay.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.649
Hello. Please come in.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.080
Rosalee Calvert?

30:56.160 --> 30:57.241
Yes.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.687
Are you prepared
for what I have to do?

31:00.840 --> 31:01.887
Uh...

31:04.480 --> 31:05.776
Why don't I have
a look at your husband?

31:05.800 --> 31:07.040
That would be me.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.488
Actually, uh, the truth is we called
you because we need to talk to you

31:13.600 --> 31:14.931
about something else.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.924
Well, we don't need to
talk to you, they do.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.285
Dr. Landeaux?

31:22.400 --> 31:24.641
What's going on?
Why are the police here?

31:25.320 --> 31:27.641
Sorry to do this
under false pretenses.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.240
I'm a Grimm.

31:32.960 --> 31:33.961
It's okay!

31:34.040 --> 31:36.122
He's a Grimm, but he's a friend!

31:36.200 --> 31:37.440
A Grimm?

31:38.200 --> 31:39.201
Hmm?

31:44.920 --> 31:46.251
That's better.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.527
He just wants to talk to you.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.644
About what? About what you do.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.970
Did you help Mrs. Cutler die?

31:55.040 --> 31:56.136
We're not here to arrest you.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.456
We just need to
confirm you did it.

31:57.480 --> 31:58.527
Why?

31:58.600 --> 32:00.640
Because the orderly she
attacked while she was Woged

32:00.680 --> 32:03.081
could go to prison
for defending himself.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.521
Yes.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.488
I helped Mrs. Cutler pass.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.845
Unfortunately,
I waited too long to act.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.840
I regret what happened,

32:15.920 --> 32:19.163
but my responsibility is to
protect the Wesen community.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.447
And my responsibility
is to protect Mason Wilcox.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.284
I can't do anything to help him.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.124
I mean, how can we
explain all this?

32:25.200 --> 32:27.726
We've gotten pretty good at it.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.808
You need to convince
Nurse Barton

32:29.880 --> 32:32.884
that Mason Wilcox had nothing
to do with Mrs. Cutler's death.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.122
And you need to testify in
court if it goes to trial.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.123
You're her primary physician.
People will listen.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.248
Yes, but it won't help Mason
explain what he saw.

32:39.360 --> 32:41.488
No, but it'll give him his freedom.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.724
Excuse me, I have to take this.

32:44.800 --> 32:45.881
Yes?

32:46.120 --> 32:47.167
No.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.324
No, you can't.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.323
No, stay away from him.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.565
I'm on my way.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.608
A man suffering
from severe dementia,

32:56.680 --> 32:58.728
a Drang-Zorn,
is threatening his wife.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.485
Then we're going, too.
What's the address?

33:01.560 --> 33:02.891
It's okay.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.566
6931 Northwest McClellen.

33:07.640 --> 33:10.086
Wait! 6931 McClellen?

33:10.160 --> 33:12.083
I think I know that address.
What?

33:12.160 --> 33:14.049
Were you talking
to Mrs. Stanton?

33:14.120 --> 33:16.043
Yes. Do you know her?

33:16.120 --> 33:17.565
She's been a customer forever.

33:17.680 --> 33:18.920
We should go with you.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.240
Right.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.925
Stay here, sir.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.601
Dr. Landeaux.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.170
Mrs. Stanton.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.205
Where's your husband?

33:49.280 --> 33:50.520
He left.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.291
Mrs. Stanton.

33:57.280 --> 33:59.487
Why did you bring
all these people?

33:59.560 --> 34:00.721
We're here to help.

34:00.800 --> 34:01.961
Are you hurt?

34:02.040 --> 34:03.041
No!

34:03.120 --> 34:05.726
He has never attacked me before.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.200
Do you know where
your husband went?

34:07.240 --> 34:09.481
No.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.960
But I'm afraid
he's doing bad things.

34:13.199 --> 34:18.809
I tried to get him not to leave
again, but he was just so...

34:21.440 --> 34:23.886
He doesn't know what he's doing.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.643
How long ago did he leave?

34:25.719 --> 34:26.960
Fifteen, 20 minutes.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.326
Does he drive?

34:28.400 --> 34:31.085
No, not anymore.
We got rid of the car.

34:31.159 --> 34:34.801
I tried calling him,
but he's not picking up.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.376
Well, if he has his
phone, we can track him.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.447
Do you have his number?

34:37.520 --> 34:39.806
It's the last number I called.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.199
All right.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.656
This neighborhood isn't far from
the other two Wesen attacks.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.920
Mr. Stanton should be our guy.

34:48.639 --> 34:51.324
Wu, I need you to write down a number.
We need a location, quick.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.245
I'm going with you.

34:53.360 --> 34:54.771
They'll find him.

34:54.840 --> 34:59.448
I was just trying to keep him
from wandering away at night.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.000
I know the melatonin
wasn't for you.

35:02.120 --> 35:05.169
I couldn't get
him to stay asleep.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.322
I would wake up
and he'd be gone.

35:09.360 --> 35:10.805
Rosalee.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.690
Elizabeth!

35:25.760 --> 35:29.242
I'm sorry, I think you're
mistaking me for someone else.

35:30.720 --> 35:31.767
Hey!

35:31.840 --> 35:34.525
You can't do that!

35:34.600 --> 35:36.409
Leave me alone.

35:37.080 --> 35:38.525
Elizabeth!

35:43.680 --> 35:44.966
Mr. Stanton?

35:45.400 --> 35:48.324
Do you know where my wife is?

35:48.400 --> 35:51.370
I can't find her anywhere.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.521
She's at home.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.045
We can take you there.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.167
I don't know who you are!

35:58.240 --> 36:01.323
I want my wife!

36:01.400 --> 36:03.136
Sir, we're your friends.
We're here to help you.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.286
What'd you do with her?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.843
What'd you do with Elizabeth?

36:06.920 --> 36:08.046
Calm down!

36:08.360 --> 36:10.124
Sir!

36:11.040 --> 36:12.096
- I got him.
- Get him in the car.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.202
I got him. Get his cane.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.406
Get his cane.

36:15.480 --> 36:16.896
It's okay.
Hey, don't... Don't hurt me!

36:16.920 --> 36:18.684
- Don't hurt me!
- It's okay. It's okay.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.762
Nick. Elizabeth!

36:20.840 --> 36:22.729
Help me! Help me!

36:23.360 --> 36:25.283
They're here.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.080
Norm!

36:33.960 --> 36:35.166
Thank God.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.124
Do I know you?

36:38.200 --> 36:39.531
It's me.

36:39.600 --> 36:42.080
Elizabeth. I'm your wife.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.083
Where am I?

36:44.160 --> 36:47.084
You're home, darling.
You're home.

36:47.160 --> 36:49.208
You live here with me.

36:49.280 --> 36:50.361
What...

36:50.440 --> 36:51.771
What are you all doing here?

36:51.840 --> 36:53.649
It's all right, Norm.

36:53.960 --> 36:55.610
You're home. They're
here to help.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.207
Honey, here.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.561
Here, this is your
favorite chair.

37:00.640 --> 37:03.803
Come. Come, sit down.
You need to rest.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.764
It's okay.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.289
I'm right here, sweetheart.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.247
Hey.

37:13.320 --> 37:16.051
All right,
just sit back and relax now.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.561
Everything okay?

37:17.640 --> 37:19.210
Yeah. You have it?

37:19.600 --> 37:20.840
Yeah.

37:56.680 --> 37:57.966
What's with the cane?

37:58.040 --> 38:00.281
Ties Mr. Stanton
to two Wesen kills.

38:00.360 --> 38:01.566
Oh, no.

38:01.880 --> 38:04.611
I'm sure he had
no idea what he was doing.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.250
Maybe that's a good thing.

38:06.320 --> 38:08.209
If he goes to jail,
he could Woge in custody.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.001
He could kill somebody else.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.969
And no way you could
ever take it to trial.

38:17.440 --> 38:19.283
All right,
let's just let him rest.

38:24.120 --> 38:26.043
Do what you have to do.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.407
We're not gonna interfere.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.241
Okay-

38:39.120 --> 38:40.963
Do you want us to stay with you?

38:41.040 --> 38:43.407
Yes, I'd like that.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.366
Are you ready?

38:48.800 --> 38:49.881
Yes.

38:58.640 --> 39:02.087
You sleep now, sweetheart.

39:02.160 --> 39:03.571
I love you.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.045
I'm gonna miss you.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.049
I'll see you soon, Norm.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.088
Okay?

39:15.520 --> 39:17.045
Okay, Elizabeth.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.646
Monroe?

39:55.720 --> 39:56.960
Rosalee?

39:57.560 --> 39:59.608
I found something
I think you guys should see.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.366
I know you're in there.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.364
What did I do wrong?
