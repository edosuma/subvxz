Stop making

As King and Queen...

00:40.875 --> 00:42.875
- Hello.

00:56.583 --> 00:59.291
- Ah, the Ren Faire,

00:59.333 --> 01:02.417
scratch whatever itches,

00:59.333 --> 01:02.417

Dawn, you be will.

You guys are gonna ruin

01:12.875 --> 01:14.750
Why can't I just go

01:12.875 --> 01:14.750
with somebody more mature?

01:14.792 --> 01:16.208
- [gasps]

01:16.250 --> 01:18.625
Who could possibly be

01:16.250 --> 01:18.625
more mature than us?

01:22.667 --> 01:24.375
- Someone like Mack.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.041
- That's pretty mature.

01:26.083 --> 01:28.291
- In fact,

01:26.083 --> 01:28.291
I'm gonna go ask Mack

01:28.333 --> 01:30.792
to go to the Ren Faire with me,

01:28.333 --> 01:30.792
and show you guys

how mature people

01:30.834 --> 01:33.333

- A date, huh?

01:33.375 --> 01:35.583
[both scream]

01:35.625 --> 01:37.250

01:35.625 --> 01:37.250

01:37.291 --> 01:40.208
Say, a new outfit,

01:37.291 --> 01:40.208
some lip gloss...

01:40.250 --> 01:41.417
- It's not a date, Dooley.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.792
Mack and I hang out together

01:41.458 --> 01:43.792
all the time.

01:43.834 --> 01:48.041
We've been to the movies,

01:43.834 --> 01:48.041

We're talking

01:53.208 --> 01:57.750
an all-day commitment.

01:57.792 --> 02:02.041
- What's wrong, Dawn?

01:57.792 --> 02:02.041
Not mature enough for a date?

02:02.083 --> 02:04.667
- Please.

02:02.083 --> 02:04.667
"Mature" is my middle name.

02:04.709 --> 02:06.709
- I'm pretty sure it's Abigail.

02:06.750 --> 02:08.000
- It is?

02:08.041 --> 02:09.500
Wait, then whose middle name

02:08.041 --> 02:09.500
is Steven?

02:09.542 --> 02:10.709
- Yours.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.375
- Uh, pretty sure mine's

Abigail.

02:12.417 --> 02:14.417
- Steven!

02:14.458 --> 02:16.000

02:16.041 --> 02:19.667
the mature Quad has

02:16.041 --> 02:19.667

02:21.500 --> 02:25.083

- Hey, Mack, do you wanna go

02:25.125 --> 02:26.917
on a date with me

02:26.959 --> 02:28.166

02:28.208 --> 02:31.834

02:43.291 --> 02:45.667
she's going on a date.

- I can't believe

02:45.709 --> 02:48.333
I'm going on a date.

02:48.375 --> 02:50.375
- She's not mature enough

02:48.375 --> 02:50.375
for a date.

02:50.417 --> 02:52.500
- I'm not mature enough

02:50.417 --> 02:52.500
for a date.

02:52.542 --> 02:54.959
- As much as I'd hate

02:52.542 --> 02:54.959
to admit it,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.542
maybe Dawn is

02:55.000 --> 02:57.542
more mature than us.

02:57.583 --> 02:58.917
- But we're Quads.

everything together.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.000
learning to ride bikes;

03:03.041 --> 03:04.917
learning long division.

03:04.959 --> 03:08.917
- Yeah, long division.

03:08.959 --> 03:12.083
- Yeah, riding bikes.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.625
- You have to come with me.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.625
- [scoffs]

03:13.667 --> 03:16.291
I don't wanna be

03:13.667 --> 03:16.291

- Oh, hey, Miles.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.500
May wants to know

03:18.542 --> 03:20.917
if you wanna go on a date with

03:18.542 --> 03:20.917
her to the Renaissance Faire.

03:20.959 --> 03:22.458
- Really? You do?

03:22.500 --> 03:25.333
- I do?

03:22.500 --> 03:25.333
- You do.

03:25.375 --> 03:27.875
- I do!

03:25.375 --> 03:27.875
I--I mean, only if you want--

03:27.917 --> 03:29.542
- I do.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.542
- Oh, cool.

03:29.583 --> 03:31.375
- Cool.

03:31.417 --> 03:33.166
- Cool.

03:33.208 --> 03:35.625
Hey, guys. Dawn just got me

03:33.208 --> 03:35.625
a date with Mae.

03:35.667 --> 03:38.417
Yes!

03:38.458 --> 03:40.875
- Now she's getting dates

03:38.458 --> 03:40.875
for other people?

03:40.917 --> 03:42.375
We gotta get dates.

03:42.417 --> 03:44.625
- Maybe we should get Dawn

03:42.417 --> 03:44.625
to get us dates.

03:44.667 --> 03:47.583
- No, we've gotta get

03:44.667 --> 03:47.583
our own dates.

03:47.625 --> 03:51.542
- I don't know,

03:47.625 --> 03:51.542
she seems pretty good at it.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.166
- Yeah, and I'm sure

03:51.583 --> 03:53.166
she wouldn't mind helping us.

03:53.208 --> 03:56.625
I mean, she holds me up

03:53.208 --> 03:56.625
when I ride a bike...

03:56.667 --> 03:58.709
for some reason.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.667
- We are getting our own dates!

04:00.709 --> 04:05.125
And you're learning

04:00.709 --> 04:05.125
how to ride a bike!

04:05.166 --> 04:07.959
- I know how to ride a bike.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.875
Will you hold me like Dawn?

04:36.375 --> 04:38.166
how to ride a bike

04:38.208 --> 04:40.041
before we asked the girls out?

04:40.083 --> 04:42.291
- I thought it would give us

04:40.083 --> 04:42.291
confidence heading into this.

04:42.417 --> 04:46.917
- And it worked.

- Hello, ladies.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.041
- What's the haps?

04:58.083 --> 04:59.834
- Would you girls wanna

04:58.083 --> 04:59.834
go on a date with us

04:59.875 --> 05:02.667
to the Ren Faire?

05:02.709 --> 05:04.000
all: Why not?

05:04.041 --> 05:06.166
- What are those boys up to?

05:06.208 --> 05:11.250
- I don't know,

05:06.208 --> 05:11.250
but it doesn't look cool.

05:11.291 --> 05:13.375
- Guess who just boarded

05:11.291 --> 05:13.375
the next boat to mature island?

05:13.417 --> 05:15.959
- We just asked

05:13.417 --> 05:15.959
Olivia, Avery, and June

05:16.000 --> 05:18.583
to go to the Faire as our dates.

05:18.625 --> 05:22.041
- And they said, "Why not?"

05:22.083 --> 05:23.375
- I know what you're up to.

05:23.417 --> 05:25.917
- Up to?

05:23.417 --> 05:25.917
We're just being mature.

05:25.959 --> 05:29.125
- It sounds like your slow boat

05:25.959 --> 05:29.125
is following my jet plane.

05:29.166 --> 05:30.583
But I guess that makes sense,

05:30.625 --> 05:33.291
because girls do mature

05:30.625 --> 05:33.291
faster than boys.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.625
- Oh, yeah?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.625
Care to prove it?

05:35.667 --> 05:37.333
- I don't have anything

05:35.667 --> 05:37.333
to prove to you.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.834
- Oh, yeah?

05:37.375 --> 05:39.834
Prove that.

05:39.875 --> 05:43.166
- Nothing is getting proven,

05:39.875 --> 05:43.166
except how immature you all are.

05:43.208 --> 05:45.208
- Since we maturely disagree,

05:45.250 --> 05:47.834
why don't we settle this

05:45.250 --> 05:47.834
with a little mature-off?

05:47.875 --> 05:50.542
- Yeah.

05:47.875 --> 05:50.542
both: A mature-off!

05:50.583 --> 05:53.000
- I'd accept your challenge,

05:50.583 --> 05:53.000
and I'd win,

05:53.041 --> 05:56.250
but lucky for you, there's

05:53.041 --> 05:56.250
no such thing as a mature-off.

05:56.291 --> 05:58.250
- A mature-off, huh?

05:56.291 --> 05:58.250
[all scream]

05:58.291 --> 05:59.792
- Oh, there's such a thing.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.709
- This should be good.

06:01.750 --> 06:03.750
- Getting a date is easy,

06:03.792 --> 06:07.417
but the mark of true maturity

06:03.792 --> 06:07.417
is making a connection.

06:07.458 --> 06:08.875
- What kind of connection?

06:09.291 --> 06:12.166
- Mind, body, soul.

06:12.208 --> 06:15.625
The triangle of romance.

06:12.208 --> 06:15.625
all: Whoa.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.458
- No.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.166
- Hey,

06:17.500 --> 06:19.166
I don't make this stuff up.

06:19.208 --> 06:21.333
- I think you do.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.250
- First,

06:21.375 --> 06:23.250
you must connect the mind,

06:23.291 --> 06:25.250
which you'll do

06:23.291 --> 06:25.250
through simple conversation.

06:25.291 --> 06:27.458
- Mack and I talk all the time.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.667
- Next, the body, a connection

06:27.500 --> 06:30.667
by holding hands,

06:30.709 --> 06:32.417
fingers intertwined.

06:32.458 --> 06:36.500
- We have hands.

06:32.458 --> 06:36.500
- [whispers] Whoo.

06:36.542 --> 06:38.583
- And third,

06:36.542 --> 06:38.583
while holding hands,

06:38.625 --> 06:41.166
you must look deeply

06:38.625 --> 06:41.166
into each other's eyes,

06:41.208 --> 06:43.834
thus connecting your souls.

06:43.875 --> 06:44.959
- We have souls.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
- On both feet.

06:48.959 --> 06:50.625
- But how do you know so much

06:48.959 --> 06:50.625
about romance?

06:50.667 --> 06:51.750
- He doesn't.

06:52.542 --> 06:53.875
- She's right.

06:52.542 --> 06:53.875
I don't.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.875
But my sister does.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.709
She's in high school.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.083
all: Oh!

07:01.125 --> 07:03.083
- So?

07:03.125 --> 07:04.750
- And she has a boyfriend.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.709
all: Whoa.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.583
- No.

07:09.625 --> 07:10.667
- And he drives.

07:10.709 --> 07:12.041
all: What?

07:12.083 --> 07:15.000
- Ever.

07:15.041 --> 07:17.667
- So now that we know the rules,

07:17.709 --> 07:19.375
do any of you boys think

07:17.709 --> 07:19.375
you have what it takes

07:19.417 --> 07:22.792
to complete

07:19.417 --> 07:22.792
the triangle of romance?

07:22.834 --> 07:25.125
I know I do.
