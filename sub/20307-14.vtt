WEBVTT

00:02.502 --> 00:05.296
(indistinct conversations)

00:20.645 --> 00:22.564
(clears throat)
Did you see anything, ma'am?

00:23.273 --> 00:25.191
Wish all the junkies would be dead.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.445
Listen, what's that foam on her mouth?

00:28.528 --> 00:29.821
Some kind of seizure.

00:29.904 --> 00:32.198
Tell the lab I want
to see a tox scan ASAP.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.450
Hey, hey, come here.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.869
Hey, what's the beef? I'm going to work.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.079
-A couple of OD's
-Got a gimmick on you, gypsy?

00:38.163 --> 00:39.289
Aw, man!

00:41.207 --> 00:44.169
Hey, that's a brand-clean binky.
That's how I keep from infection.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.754
What's that crap on their mouths?

00:45.837 --> 00:47.172
The cats did themselves.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.298
Hey, man, let me go.

00:48.381 --> 00:49.466
I just got a job.

00:49.549 --> 00:52.510
Yeah, right. Well, you write
when you get a promotion, huh?

00:53.219 --> 00:56.097
-(exhales) Get that lab work.
-Right.

00:57.974 --> 00:59.100
STAN: Item five.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.519
Ongoings and undercovers.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.855
Oller and Echeveria are countermen

01:03.938 --> 01:08.193
at Black Frank's Sandwich Oasis,
116 and Jefferson.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.236
LaRue and Washington continue theirs

01:10.320 --> 01:12.989
at Sylvestri's Emporium of Tattoo.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.033
Six: pairings.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.451
Breem's got the flu.

01:16.534 --> 01:19.370
Yo, Renko, what do you hear from Bobby?

01:19.454 --> 01:22.582
He's still down home.
His daddy's funeral is this morning.

01:22.665 --> 01:26.086
Seven, a hooker's sweep, Dekker and 136.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.088
-(jeering)
-Oh, come on, Sarge.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.758
Move them again. Division wants them
back off the major thoroughfare.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.636
Then they move right back Van Buren
where they were last month.

01:34.719 --> 01:36.179
Musical whores.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.806
(laughter)

01:37.889 --> 01:43.061
Eight, as regards
yesterday's city council interpretation

01:43.144 --> 01:46.606
of reg 333-C.

01:46.689 --> 01:47.816
Ah.

01:48.775 --> 01:52.028
"The council has decided
that all precincts,

01:52.112 --> 01:55.198
as well as fire, sanitation,
human services,

01:55.281 --> 01:56.991
and other city-government facilities,

01:57.075 --> 02:00.078
are to be considered public places."

02:00.161 --> 02:01.454
Now, that means...

02:02.205 --> 02:05.959
That means that there's gonna be
no smoking in this building

02:06.042 --> 02:10.338
except in sanctioned areas
specifically designated.

02:10.421 --> 02:13.007
Oh, gee, I hope Dad doesn't catch me.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.717
I won't get the car this weekend.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.596
Violators are subject to a $50 fine.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.391
-Hmm.
-STAN: Now, look,

02:21.474 --> 02:23.768
I'm gonna allow it in the lavatories,

02:23.852 --> 02:26.938
and we're gonna cordon off
a special smoking section

02:27.021 --> 02:28.356
over by the canteen.

02:28.439 --> 02:29.941
Now speaking personal,

02:30.024 --> 02:33.153
I'm for anything
that helps people to cut down.

02:33.236 --> 02:36.447
And that comes from a former
pack-and-a-half- a-day man.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.701
Last, on a happier note,

02:40.201 --> 02:42.203
Mick Belker and bride phoned.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.830
They asked me to thank everybody

02:43.913 --> 02:45.832
for the flowers
that we had delivered to them

02:45.915 --> 02:47.000
up at the lodge.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.127
-(cheering)
-Okay, okay, that's it.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.087
Let's roll.
They're getting away out there.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.964
-(chattering)
-Oh, wait a minute!

02:53.047 --> 02:54.382
Wait a minute. One more thing.

02:54.465 --> 02:58.136
Uh, Section C, this AM's <i>Tribune.</i>

02:58.219 --> 03:02.390
the captain's picture addressing
the Monsignor Keller dinner last night.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.767
-(chattering)
-Okay, that's it. Let's roll.

03:04.851 --> 03:09.397
(indistinct conversations)

03:09.480 --> 03:11.900
(telephone rings)

03:13.943 --> 03:16.946
A nice-looking fella addressing
the local power structure last night.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.157
(chuckles) Yeah, well, I told them,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.618
"more cops on the beat,
less crime in the streets."

03:21.701 --> 03:24.412
-Catchy.
-Then I launched into real clichÃ©s.

03:24.495 --> 03:27.415
Frank, if you got a moment, could you
witness my mortgage signatures?

03:27.498 --> 03:29.459
-Sure. I'll be in the office.
-Great, thanks.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.837
Progress on the tattoo undercover fellas?

03:32.921 --> 03:35.381
Oh, yeah, we're all caught up
on our <i>National Geographics.</i>

03:35.465 --> 03:38.051
-So far the creep's a no-show, Lieutenant.
-What's the idea?

03:38.134 --> 03:39.886
He does a robbery, then he gets a tattoo?

03:39.969 --> 03:41.638
Knocks over a drugstore, gets high,

03:41.721 --> 03:43.848
comes in to get a tattoo.
That was our information.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.476
We're gonna give it two more months,
then we're out of there.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.771
-Uh, Sergeant?
-Yeah.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.565
Can I talk to you
about this no smoking thing?

03:52.649 --> 03:53.983
What is it, Ms. Patterson?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.902
It's just the fact
that I don't ask for much.

03:55.985 --> 03:58.154
-I just do my work, right?
-Right.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.657
But I really resent
being persecuted, all right?

04:00.740 --> 04:05.245
It's like Russia. I smoke cigarettes.
That makes me a second-class citizen.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.706
I don't know whether they got no smoking
in Russia or not.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.667
Sarge, I'm taking
an hour of personal time.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.543
Right. You could smoke in the jane,

04:12.627 --> 04:14.837
or you could go over there
in the smoking section.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.261
Oh, great, the ghetto.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.057
(sighs)

04:28.434 --> 04:31.688
(coughing)

04:31.771 --> 04:34.399
Oh, you guys are disgusting.
You know that?

04:34.482 --> 04:36.818
-So go to bat for us, Lieutenant.
-Why?

04:36.901 --> 04:39.362
So you can secondary-smoke
years off my life?

04:39.445 --> 04:41.406
(coughs)
You know what's in those things, huh?

04:41.489 --> 04:44.701
Nicotine. I'm an addict,
and I deeply love it.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.120
You ain't gonna deeply,
deeply love it so much

04:47.203 --> 04:49.998
when you cough up something,
and you realize it's your lung.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.917
-Hey, give us a break, Lieutenant.
-A break, huh?

04:53.001 --> 04:56.379
You wanna hear about the break
the guy next to me in the hospital wanted?

04:56.462 --> 04:57.922
Terminal emphysema.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.507
He used to lie there going,

04:59.590 --> 05:03.094
(panting) "Please, Lord, kill me.
Please, Lord, kill me."

05:03.177 --> 05:05.596
I know kicking's hard, but it's worth it.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.224
Believe me. I did it.
I got the lungs of a Sherpa now.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.184
But, hey, you want to kill yourselves--

05:10.268 --> 05:13.479
-I'll tell you what'll kill you, fire!
-Run away from the truth.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.524
-(shouting)
-Oh, sure. That's the easy way, yeah.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.026
You smoke in bed, you fall asleep,

05:18.109 --> 05:20.236
and, all of a sudden,
you're a barbecued sparerib.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.156
Hey, hey, fire!
Hey, there's a fire in there!

05:23.239 --> 05:25.783
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:25.867 --> 05:27.952
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

05:28.036 --> 05:31.914
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:31.998 --> 05:33.416
(theme music playing)

06:39.023 --> 06:40.691
(cheerful music playing)

06:58.084 --> 07:03.881
(siren wailing)

07:32.660 --> 07:34.203
I'm pretty good at science.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.372
In biology this year I cut up a frog.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.208
Some people got sick, but I like
studying about organs and things.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.419
Did you make the frog's leg twitch?

07:41.502 --> 07:43.004
With electric current.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.797
Your science laboratory's good.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.175
-Lucy and me looked around--
-Lucy and I.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.429
I've enjoyed meeting you, Fabian.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.389
But I think that Lucy and I

07:53.890 --> 07:55.850
should have a few minutes together.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.060
-Okay, it was nice meeting you.
-Thank you.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.940
I hope I come to school here.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.567
You're a very nice young man.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.902
Thank you.

08:06.861 --> 08:07.820
I'll be right out, Fab.

08:08.905 --> 08:09.989
Okay.

08:14.869 --> 08:19.081
-He really is a good kid, Sister.
-What is your connection with him?

08:19.957 --> 08:22.251
Uh, well, his father's dead

08:22.335 --> 08:24.337
and his mother's not responsible.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.839
She's a streetwalker and a drug addict.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.090
Are you his legal guardian?

08:28.799 --> 08:30.468
I'm acting as his guardian, right.

08:31.719 --> 08:35.306
-I don't understand.
-Yes, I am acting as his guardian.

08:35.389 --> 08:38.601
I don't mean to provoke you,
but are you saying that you have legal--

08:38.684 --> 08:42.188
I thought I told you, Sister,
his father is dead,

08:42.271 --> 08:44.357
his mother is a junkie whore.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.108
His grandmother can't keep up with him.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.611
He wants to stay with me
and I'm keeping him.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.821
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
under the circumstances

08:50.905 --> 08:53.241
we can't even consider
Fabian's application.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.159
Application must be made
by the parent or--

08:55.243 --> 08:57.537
-It's always been the same.
-I'm sorry.

08:59.121 --> 09:02.166
St. Mary's always had too many rules.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.126
I could never breathe here.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.504
Lucille, I think
you're getting overwrought--

09:06.587 --> 09:09.507
I'm not overwrought, Sister.
I'm trying to get the kid in school.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.300
That's not gonna happen here.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.262
We're out of here.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.937
-Don't forget to have lunch.
-I won't.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.691
Maybe we can get Joe to come over
and have dinner tonight, huh?

09:28.109 --> 09:29.652
She didn't think I was smart enough?

09:29.735 --> 09:31.654
Malarkey. She thought you were great.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.031
It's just some problems

09:34.115 --> 09:35.866
about transferring mid-semester.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.998
You got to handle this careful, Norm.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.499
I don't even know if I'm gonna be--

09:43.583 --> 09:45.459
I was upstate with this kid.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.420
He misunderstood an event up there.

09:47.503 --> 09:50.006
I think he's got
certain suspicions about me.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.674
What do you got?

09:51.757 --> 09:54.302
It just so happens he was incorrect
about what happened.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.761
Come on, huh?

09:55.845 --> 09:58.264
So he approaches me
on the street yesterday.

09:58.347 --> 10:01.475
He dropped in from Seattle with a pal.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.687
They're talking
about moving six lids of junk.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.690
They want five large.
A hundred if it makes, all right?

10:07.773 --> 10:10.026
No, listen, Norman.
Wait. I examined the stuff.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.154
I wanted to give you a full evaluation.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.488
It's synthetic.

10:15.573 --> 10:18.034
I think the partner took a lab down
and didn't tell Bobby.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.870
Bobby's telling me,
"Oh, it's righteous, Sidney.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.580
It's easy four-step."

10:23.122 --> 10:25.791
Norman, you want to step on
this stuff four times,

10:25.875 --> 10:28.377
anybody who looks at it
is gonna fall over.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.463
Is it possible any's on the street?

10:31.380 --> 10:33.966
Yeah, he might be moving some
for walking-around money.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.926
Stay here. I want to see my captain.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.720
Norman, it's synthetics.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.639
It's now. It's trendy.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.849
Is there any possibility
we can go more than a yard?

10:43.517 --> 10:45.186
-A deuce.
-Oh.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.731
Always ask.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.567
In regards
to this no-smoking reg, Captain,

10:51.651 --> 10:54.070
-just to bring you up to speed--
-It's a pan.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.697
It's causing a lot of civil disturbance
amidst the men,

10:56.781 --> 10:58.783
pitting man against man, etcetera.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.869
Plus I understand that on the street
we're getting a lot of calls on this.

11:01.952 --> 11:05.331
-We catch them, Stan. We don't cook them.
-In other words, the reg gets enforced.

11:05.414 --> 11:06.707
It's an ordinance, a law.

11:06.791 --> 11:10.836
-What about in-house violations?
-Try three warnings per individual.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.214
-Yeah, okay.
-Norm.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.383
Yeah, can I get to our flash money,
Captain?

11:15.466 --> 11:17.301
I got a line on some designer dope.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.178
We only have about 650 bucks.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.138
That's okay. That'll make it.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.933
-What are they asking?
-Five grand.

11:24.642 --> 11:26.769
Hey, I'll give them the Buntz showcase.

11:26.852 --> 11:30.398
-Which would be?
-A Mexican bankroll. A newsprint sandwich.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.483
Captain, if we have
to go through Division,

11:32.566 --> 11:34.276
they're gonna yank our chains for a week.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.404
I think the stuff's
maybe already circulating.

11:36.487 --> 11:39.198
-This morning's ODs?
-That's a strong possibility.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.117
The sellers don't know what they got.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.702
They're talking four steps here.

11:42.785 --> 11:46.122
The junk could be heroin times 60 or 80.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.542
-Backups.
-Lots of them.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.086
(telephone rings)

11:52.545 --> 11:54.463
So, how did Fabe's interview go?

11:54.547 --> 11:56.132
I got to pull myself together.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.466
What's the matter?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.719
I guess I think
it's gonna be like last time.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.262
Go through all that bureaucratic mess,

12:01.345 --> 12:03.431
and then find out
I'm not gonna be able to keep him.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.392
I've just been pretending
like I don't have to do anything.

12:06.475 --> 12:07.560
Just take it easy.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.814
Hey, Stan, can I have
a clarification if you will?

12:11.897 --> 12:15.234
Now, would a pipe
and/or any other non-inhaled instrument

12:15.317 --> 12:18.320
be included in this--
in this no-smoking business?

12:18.404 --> 12:19.739
Pipes are included.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.074
Oh, Judas,

12:22.158 --> 12:24.118
next it'll be gun control.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.204
(telephone rings)

12:27.288 --> 12:28.622
Busting me for dating?

12:28.706 --> 12:30.791
You ought to be busting her
for kidnapping!

12:30.875 --> 12:32.460
-Shut up.
-I talked to my mother

12:32.543 --> 12:34.295
last night in Raleigh.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.255
Said Fabian come to stay with you.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.048
-Come on.
-She got my son!

12:38.132 --> 12:39.842
-Come on.
-She got my son! Ask her if she--

12:39.925 --> 12:43.053
Okay, I want to talk to her for a minute.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.598
(indistinct chattering)

12:45.681 --> 12:48.142
(telephone ringing)

12:53.939 --> 12:55.733
Now, nobody kidnapped Fabian.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.860
He came to see me.

12:57.943 --> 12:59.612
And now you're keeping him.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.909
What do you care, Mrs. Dewitt?
You could have stayed with him.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.911
You could have stayed clean.
You picked junk.

13:06.994 --> 13:10.206
You don't think I care about him?
Why do you think I call there?

13:10.289 --> 13:13.542
Fabian says you call his grandmother,
ask for bus fare to come back.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.503
She wires it to you,
then you spend it on dope.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.004
Maybe that's what you were doing.

13:17.087 --> 13:20.966
-What do you want to do with him?
-Well, he's gonna live with me.

13:21.050 --> 13:24.053
-He's gonna go to school.
-Ain't! Unless I say so.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.849
Miss Dewitt, I'm not backing down
like last time.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.519
I'll have him go and stay
with his grandmother.

13:32.228 --> 13:36.190
-The court won't give him to you.
-Why are you doing this? What do you want?

13:38.108 --> 13:39.610
You want Fabian?

13:39.693 --> 13:41.320
You better take care of me.

13:41.403 --> 13:44.073
You take care of me, I'll let him go.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.999
You gonna take care of me?

14:02.049 --> 14:03.342
Thanks.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.427
Hey, what's the story?

14:05.511 --> 14:07.680
Lucy, you got backup on a 211.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.724
Are you all right?

14:11.392 --> 14:12.351
Let's go.

14:12.434 --> 14:15.020
(telephone ringing)

14:15.729 --> 14:17.106
So, what did she want?

14:17.189 --> 14:18.524
She wants to sell him to me.

14:29.201 --> 14:34.123
(indistinct conversations)

14:35.082 --> 14:37.084
Reggie was your dad?

14:37.167 --> 14:38.669
Yeah. Yeah, he was.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.298
He used to go with you
and buy candy in the store?

14:42.381 --> 14:45.759
(chuckles) When he had money, sure.

14:45.843 --> 14:50.389
Um, some days, Mikey,
he didn't have money.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.682
I liked your dad.

14:52.766 --> 14:55.019
Hey, champ, how about grabbing
some of those cold cuts

14:55.102 --> 14:56.604
before they're all gone, all right?

14:57.855 --> 14:59.982
Come say goodbye to Mr. Birdwell.

15:00.065 --> 15:03.110
Oh, Mr. Birdwell. Mighty fine ham, sir.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.153
Thank you.

15:04.236 --> 15:07.656
Oh, Bobby, you got a second?
There's somebody I want you to meet.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.159
Mrs. Bethel,
couldn't it just wait one second?

15:10.242 --> 15:13.329
It won't take long.
Otherwise, she's leaving.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.081
Renee!

15:16.874 --> 15:18.500
Come here, sweetheart.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.085
You remember Bobby Hill, don't you?

15:20.628 --> 15:22.546
Bobby, this is my daughter Renee.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.923
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:25.674 --> 15:28.260
No, not Becky's sister!

15:28.344 --> 15:33.182
You mean the little fireplug, Renee Bethel
from across the street? Wow.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.100
(chuckles)
You know, the last time I saw you

15:35.184 --> 15:37.186
was at some all-city basketball game.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.188
You scored so many points.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.106
I remember
you got a big trophy at the end.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.400
And then you went out
with my big sister, Becky.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.527
-How is she?
-Becky?

15:45.611 --> 15:48.614
-Mm-hmm.
-Married, two kids.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.700
-And you?
-(laughs) No, I'm still in school.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.827
(sighs) This is unbelievable.

15:53.911 --> 15:57.414
The last time I saw you,
you were seven years old.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.666
(chuckles)

15:58.749 --> 16:00.918
The kitchen is stacked up with trash.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.711
Could you make a run to the dump?

16:02.795 --> 16:04.421
Oh, sure. In a minute.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.257
It's all right. I was just leaving.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.469
You look great.

16:11.512 --> 16:15.057
-Would you like some company?
-Yeah, sure.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.101
Come on.

16:18.435 --> 16:24.149
(siren wailing)

16:24.233 --> 16:25.359
I don't believe it.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.569
She wants money to make you his guardian?

16:27.653 --> 16:29.905
(exhales)
That's got to help your case, Lucy.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.740
If anything, it proves she is unfit.

16:32.741 --> 16:33.993
What do you think?

16:34.076 --> 16:36.328
-Maybe.
-All you got to do is

16:36.412 --> 16:38.789
go to the foster authorities
and tell them what she said,

16:38.872 --> 16:41.250
and it's got to strengthen your case
for getting Fabian.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.418
It might.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.878
When are you gonna do it?

16:44.962 --> 16:46.714
When are you gonna tell them what she did?

16:47.339 --> 16:48.549
I don't know.

16:48.632 --> 16:50.843
(siren wailing)

16:50.926 --> 16:53.095
(horn honks)

16:58.600 --> 17:00.561
(indistinct conversation)

17:00.644 --> 17:03.022
WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
back away, please.

17:03.897 --> 17:06.859
He hit him with no reason.
We had already given him the money.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.777
He hit him like this
with the butt of the gun.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.571
-You got the primary covered?
-Yeah.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.823
-We're gonna take perimeter.
-Good.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.034
-You're starting to worry me now.
-About what?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.953
Because I think you're thinking
about doing what his mother wants.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.914
Excuse me, ma'am. Did you see
what happened down there?

17:20.998 --> 17:24.168
-Yes, I saw the man run away.
-Well, can you give me a description?

17:24.251 --> 17:25.210
-How about that?
-Yes.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.378
-Am I wrong?
-He was--

17:26.462 --> 17:29.882
Just a second. Joe, why don't you take
care of this gentlemen right here?

17:29.965 --> 17:31.967
Just tell me if I'm wrong.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.428
-So how well did you see?
-I saw his face.

17:34.511 --> 17:37.765
He was a white guy with scraggly hair,

17:37.848 --> 17:39.975
and, um, tall.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.685
A leather jacket.

17:42.811 --> 17:43.854
I'll check the wire.

17:43.937 --> 17:45.981
Yeah, yell up what I'm saying
if it's working.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.357
-Coffee?
-Thanks.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.442
Be right back.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.236
Oh, cream, please.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.406
Oh, I don't know.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.367
Somebody's mama spoiled him.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.495
I was her favorite little boy.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.748
-You feel it, don't you, Terr?
-Feel what?

18:02.831 --> 18:05.042
This tremendous sexual buzz between us.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.169
(chuckles) You got a head injury.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.171
We can't till the undercover's over.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.756
-Can't what?
-Make it.

18:10.839 --> 18:14.343
No matter how much we both want to,
not till we pop this dude and close down.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.385
Company rules.

18:18.138 --> 18:22.434
What happens when the girl says yes?
Do you head south?

18:23.435 --> 18:25.646
Mm-mm. Definitely not.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.901
I wish your friend weren't here.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.862
Yeah, Neal hasn't said anything.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.823
I hope the batteries ain't dead.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.575
If you need them,
I got some in a vibrator.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.830
Shame on me for what I'm thinking.

18:44.206 --> 18:47.918
NEAL: Shame on me for what I'm thinking!
(laughs)

18:52.089 --> 18:54.091
It hasn't changed that much.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.843
Dossier's changed totally.

18:55.926 --> 19:00.305
The ice cream isn't homemade anymore,
and singles cost 35 cents.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.809
-I don't remember singles.
-They didn't have singles

19:03.892 --> 19:06.728
when you were growing up?
(laughs) You are a lot older than me.

19:06.812 --> 19:07.688
(laughs) Oh.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.482
Dossier's singles
with the licorice inside?

19:10.566 --> 19:12.401
(laughing) No.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.823
So, where are you nursing now?

19:17.906 --> 19:18.991
Mt. Hope.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.077
But I have applications
in for schools up north.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.329
Sure wish you'd come
to my neck of the woods.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.707
-I applied to Mercy General.
-No kidding.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.584
It's, like, second on my list.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.543
(laughs)

19:30.252 --> 19:31.336
(chuckles)

19:34.089 --> 19:35.507
Renee, um...

19:36.091 --> 19:36.925
What?

19:38.260 --> 19:39.553
I really like you.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.347
I like you, Bobby.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.602
What?

19:47.352 --> 19:49.146
Now if you're gonna say that I'm so young.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.982
I'm too young, the little girl
who was your fire hydrant,

19:52.065 --> 19:55.319
-or whatever that was that you said.
-(chuckles) Fireplug.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.529
Well, whatever it was.

19:57.613 --> 19:58.530
Uh-huh.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.991
This is unbelievable,

20:01.533 --> 20:03.535
and on the day of Reggie's funeral.

20:16.798 --> 20:18.634
Plus the girl next door.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.428
Across the street.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.849
The description coming in
on this liquor store 211

20:25.933 --> 20:27.768
are matching our pharmacy thief, Captain.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.394
Maybe he's branching out.

20:29.478 --> 20:32.397
Better notify Neal and J.D.
They may be getting some business.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.067
-How are we doing on the smoking?
-Pretty good on compliance,

20:35.150 --> 20:38.987
but I wouldn't say
the working atmosphere was so great.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.281
Back in an hour.
I'll be at division chief's office.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.616
Right.

20:42.699 --> 20:46.119
Oh, Lucy, there's a pross
waiting to see you.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.704
Dewitt?

20:47.788 --> 20:48.914
Garden level.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.760
-That is completely illegible.
-What?

21:01.843 --> 21:04.054
Under "purpose of disbursement."

21:05.514 --> 21:07.057
"Drug buy." You can't read that?

21:08.642 --> 21:10.435
I'm not paid to be a translator.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.479
Hey, how about signing out the flash money

21:12.562 --> 21:14.731
and save the stone crushing,
huh, Miss Patterson?

21:14.815 --> 21:18.068
You are just what I need today.
Exactly what the doctor ordered.

21:18.151 --> 21:21.071
First these moron smoking regulations.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.448
That's a violation.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.909
I don't care.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.788
(clears throat)
Just give me the buy money.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.832
-Aren't you gonna bust me, Lieutenant?
-Give me the dough.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.003
Come on, Mr. Big shot.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.505
Come on, Mr. Never-Calls-Back.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.592
You're lucky I'm busy.

21:45.929 --> 21:47.723
Oh, Frank, come in, come in.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.266
Chief.

21:52.227 --> 21:54.229
You're a gifted man, Frank.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.106
Let's sit over there.

21:57.607 --> 22:00.068
You know, if I help a senior citizen
across the street,

22:00.152 --> 22:01.236
sit, sit,

22:02.404 --> 22:05.490
the next day the papers say,
"Daniels elbows old people."

22:06.658 --> 22:09.077
Whereas you make an openly
partisan speech--

22:09.161 --> 22:11.246
We're talking about the Keller dinner?

22:12.998 --> 22:16.168
I've gotten a very attractive offer
from the private sector, Frank.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.920
I wonder if you'd consider
shutting up long enough

22:19.004 --> 22:21.173
for my recommendation that you succeed me

22:21.256 --> 22:23.008
not to look like a cave-in.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.344
Surprised?

22:26.970 --> 22:29.765
Well, I didn't exactly walk in here
expecting this.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.810
I think the combined support of Daniels

22:33.894 --> 22:35.479
and the reformist dilettantes

22:35.562 --> 22:39.191
would come pretty close
to foreclosing Ozzie's options.

22:39.274 --> 22:40.525
Certainly food for thought.

22:40.609 --> 22:41.985
Food for thought?

22:42.652 --> 22:46.239
Frank, I'm offering
to endorse you for chief of police.

22:46.323 --> 22:49.368
I wouldn't think that two weeks
of radio silence is too stiff a price.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.496
I'm very grateful, Chief,
but I don't know if I want the job.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.289
My God. They got to you.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.958
Nobody got to me. I'm just not--

22:57.042 --> 22:59.795
It's all there in black and white,
isn't it, Frank?

22:59.878 --> 23:02.130
Graham Wells behind you on the dais,

23:03.173 --> 23:06.343
-Ozzie behind the eight ball downtown.
-Whatever that's supposed to mean?

23:06.426 --> 23:08.595
I'm making the decisions about my future.

23:08.678 --> 23:10.430
Meaning Wells hasn't talked to you
about the mayoralty?

23:12.099 --> 23:14.559
What are you choosing
between at the moment, Frank?

23:14.643 --> 23:16.228
Evasion and a straight-out lie?

23:16.311 --> 23:19.523
Yes, I've spoken to him. That doesn't mean
he wants me to run for mayor

23:19.606 --> 23:20.649
or that I would if he did.

23:20.732 --> 23:24.069
It doesn't mean I'm not interested
in being chief of police.

23:24.152 --> 23:25.946
I just have a lot to think about.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.032
Think about it, Frank.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.576
Choose what's best for you.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.788
Give me a couple of days,
that's what I'd like to do.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.374
It's just with all your speechifying

23:37.457 --> 23:39.543
about the needs of the department,

23:39.626 --> 23:41.545
I'd have thought your choice
would be a little easier.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.256
Is the weekend time enough?

23:44.339 --> 23:45.799
The weekend's fine.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.969
Tell Joyce it's a lovely likeness.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.604
Creep, stink.

23:59.688 --> 24:00.897
Got it.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.985
Three white guys on the street, fellas.

24:05.068 --> 24:06.611
Move out. Stuff looks good.

24:06.695 --> 24:09.406
Uniform's on a 3-block circuit.
Give us a little lead time.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.241
Fine.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.327
Remember, the money's short.

24:14.411 --> 24:15.829
You really got to sell the bust.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.205
Did you hear what I said?

24:17.289 --> 24:20.208
Yeah, I heard. The money's short.
I'm not gonna let him make a count.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.960
-Did you hear what I said?
-Don't worry.

24:22.043 --> 24:25.088
We'll bang you around a little bit, Sid.
They'll believe the bust.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.591
Hey, listen.
This kid, I used to snitch upstate.

24:27.674 --> 24:29.468
I really don't want to get made.

24:29.926 --> 24:31.261
Here come the fellas.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.272
Back door.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.191
Yeah, right.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.155
Hey, fellas.

24:50.697 --> 24:51.990
Bobby.

24:52.073 --> 24:52.908
Sid.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.453
What's happening, man?

24:56.536 --> 24:58.705
Bobby, this is my friend Norman.

24:59.372 --> 25:03.126
And this gentleman I do not know.

25:03.960 --> 25:04.794
This is Darnell.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.922
Darnell. Darnell, how you doing?

25:09.966 --> 25:11.009
Okay.

25:12.928 --> 25:13.762
Okay.

25:15.597 --> 25:16.932
Norman's my bank at the moment.

25:17.557 --> 25:19.142
Your bank, huh, Sid?

25:19.226 --> 25:20.477
What's he paying you for?

25:21.811 --> 25:23.772
Look, let's straighten this out right now.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.774
You contacted me.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.527
I told you I was a little bit short.
I might have to bring in a bank.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.028
If you don't trust me, Bobby,

25:30.111 --> 25:31.571
maybe we should forget
about the whole thing?

25:31.655 --> 25:34.783
Oh, I trust you,
about as much as I trust anybody.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.118
Look, Sid said $5,000 for six ounces.

25:37.202 --> 25:40.288
Yeah, powerful stuff.
Take a false step easy.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.831
Let's do business.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.792
DARNELL: Why don't you show us some money?

25:43.875 --> 25:45.168
No problem.

25:46.586 --> 25:47.754
(clears throat)

25:50.966 --> 25:53.593
Put that right back in your pocket, Norm.

25:56.012 --> 25:58.515
Bobby, don't insult our relationship.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.602
You count the bread
when he sees the stuff.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.314
We stashed across the street. Come on.

26:07.649 --> 26:08.608
What's this now?

26:08.692 --> 26:10.735
-Where's the dope at?
-Who you talking to, blood?

26:10.819 --> 26:12.612
You sold dope to my brother last night.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.115
Hey, bartender,
you got a problem customer.

26:15.198 --> 26:18.034
Garbage put my brother in the hospital.
Give up the junk you sold him.

26:18.118 --> 26:21.037
-What are you talking about, fool?
-Come on, blood, what are you doing?

26:21.746 --> 26:23.123
What's going on?

26:23.206 --> 26:24.416
It's going wrong.

26:24.499 --> 26:26.293
-Should we go in?
-No. Wait.

26:26.835 --> 26:27.836
(glass shatters)

26:28.461 --> 26:30.088
Oh, jeez.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.340
You guys here to do business with him?

26:32.424 --> 26:34.134
We don't have the slightest idea
what you're--

26:34.217 --> 26:36.094
Because I'm staying and following you.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.971
When I find out where you hid the stash,

26:38.054 --> 26:40.890
-I'm taking care of the dope.
-Look, you say the stuff's good.

26:40.974 --> 26:42.684
That's the "go" word. Come on.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.645
Norm, I'm sorry about the commotion.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.397
I don't care how good the stuff is

26:47.480 --> 26:50.150
because this here
is strictly amateur hour.

26:51.693 --> 26:52.611
T's, fella.

26:52.694 --> 26:55.447
Look, you don't have to follow us
anywhere, country,

26:55.530 --> 26:57.699
because the only place
we're going is home.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.951
Why don't you straighten this out
with your friend?

27:00.035 --> 27:01.161
I'll get back to you later.

27:01.661 --> 27:04.080
I'll try to keep him onboard.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.457
Hold on, Norm.

27:06.207 --> 27:09.044
Got some very professional friends
here, Sid.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.378
(exhales)

27:14.341 --> 27:16.092
No uniforms till he calls you in.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.552
Big guy's in there lousing it up.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.971
Say you're from the liquor authority.
Bust them on a disorderly.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.097
Can we take the dealers, too?

27:21.181 --> 27:23.391
No, they're not holding.
We'll lose the dope.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.185
-Hey, angry citizen.
-Shut up.

27:25.268 --> 27:26.645
I'm silent. I'm mute.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.356
I'm only pointing out
you make this careful plan--

27:29.439 --> 27:32.651
-That's not mute, Sidney.
-I'm expressing nervous energy.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.821
TERRY: <i>Pussycats don't wear underwear.</i>

27:36.905 --> 27:39.282
You know who I think's
getting the embroidery, Neal?

27:39.366 --> 27:42.327
I think it's that Darla
that works Dekker on 122.

27:42.410 --> 27:43.370
(chuckles)

27:43.453 --> 27:45.538
WOMAN: <i>Next time I want a mouse.</i>

27:45.622 --> 27:48.208
It is. That's Darla.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.210
TERRY:
<i>Okay, we'll put the mousy right there.</i>

27:50.293 --> 27:53.046
<i>-Have him running away and looking scared.</i>
-(chuckles)

27:53.129 --> 27:54.923
<i>-That's a good idea.</i>
-Careful, babe.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.258
What is it, Dr. Ruth?

27:57.342 --> 27:59.386
-Look, I dig Terry.
-You think she's trouble.

27:59.469 --> 28:02.138
She's a fence.
She's only a part-time fence.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.307
She's different kind of folks, J.D.,
you know it.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.059
I'm not falling for her, Neal.

28:06.142 --> 28:07.352
We're just gonna make it.

28:07.435 --> 28:09.396
We're gonna have
an incredibly fast and hot,

28:09.479 --> 28:12.482
tremendously satisfying,
meaningless experience.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.484
-Mm-hmm.
-I mean it.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.611
If that guy would ever show up.

28:19.114 --> 28:19.948
Fellas.

28:21.241 --> 28:24.411
(chuckling) Oh, great. The snake.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.079
I was afraid he might be lost.

28:26.162 --> 28:30.750
-Ah, come on. She's a sweet little snake.
-Uh-huh.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.085
Did I interrupt something?

28:32.168 --> 28:34.629
No, no. I was just lying to Neal.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.092
(knocking)

28:43.304 --> 28:45.849
Excuse me. No parking here, sir.

28:45.932 --> 28:47.350
Oh, um...

28:49.269 --> 28:50.562
I'm a cop.

28:53.440 --> 28:54.774
Hey, no kidding.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.818
I know guys in your department.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.987
Phil Ramsey, he's in Polk Street precinct.

28:59.779 --> 29:03.116
Uh, Polk Avenue. I don't know the man.

29:03.199 --> 29:05.118
Oh. Tommy Bridges?

29:05.201 --> 29:06.953
I think he's Highway Patrol.

29:07.036 --> 29:09.956
(chuckles) I met him at a convention
in Richmond last year.

29:10.039 --> 29:14.085
Is that right? No, I don't know
Tommy Bridges either.

29:16.963 --> 29:19.048
Well, look, you want to park...

29:19.132 --> 29:23.845
(chuckles) You got to be more private
up the road a couple of hundred yards.

29:23.928 --> 29:24.888
Road off to the dump.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.556
Yeah, well, we were going that way.

29:26.639 --> 29:28.725
Well, I hope you get there.

29:29.684 --> 29:30.935
(chuckles)

29:33.396 --> 29:36.524
(both laugh)

29:36.608 --> 29:40.361
I guess I ought to be getting back
to my aunt's pretty soon anyway.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.992
What? What's the matter?

29:47.410 --> 29:48.912
You're going back tonight.

29:54.375 --> 29:57.504
-(telephone ringing)
-(indistinct chattering)

30:08.932 --> 30:10.975
What's this here, Miss Patterson?

30:11.559 --> 30:13.645
This is what you bureaucrats
force people into.

30:13.728 --> 30:17.357
Very ingenious fire hazard.
Now, take it down.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.651
I can't stay in the smoking area

30:19.734 --> 30:21.236
because I have to work over here.

30:21.319 --> 30:23.655
Now, the cigarette is actually over there.

30:23.738 --> 30:26.241
-It's only brought over here for one puff.
-Second warning.

30:26.324 --> 30:29.327
-One puff.
-Miss Patterson. Second warning.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.459
People selling poison
put my brother in the hospital,

30:36.543 --> 30:38.628
and you're here hassling me?

30:38.711 --> 30:41.422
This isn't a hassle, Otis.
You're a parolee.

30:41.506 --> 30:44.509
If I sign this disorderly conduct
complaint, you're going away.

30:44.592 --> 30:47.679
The other two guys in that bar
sold my brother dope last night.

30:47.762 --> 30:49.806
-It nearly killed him.
-Did you see the sale?

30:49.889 --> 30:52.058
-Want to make the charge?
-I know they sold it to him.

30:52.141 --> 30:54.227
-In other words, you didn't see it.
-I was a junkie 11 years.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.729
I don't have to be in the bathroom
to know they moved to him.

30:56.813 --> 31:00.066
But we have to be there in order to arrest
them and get something to use in court.

31:00.149 --> 31:01.985
So you're saying
you're trying to arrest them two?

31:02.861 --> 31:05.864
That's police business. I'm not allowed
to discuss that with you.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.828
I don't want to sign this complaint, Otis,

31:12.412 --> 31:14.289
but I need to know you're not going back

31:14.372 --> 31:16.165
to the Pine Tree Inn
and make more trouble.

31:16.249 --> 31:19.669
I cleaned my life up. I'm trying to help
my brother keep himself clean.

31:20.211 --> 31:22.130
He's still sick
with that stuff they sold him.

31:23.339 --> 31:25.091
(telephone rings)

31:30.221 --> 31:32.390
Go back to the hospital.
Be with your brother.

31:32.473 --> 31:33.975
Let us do our jobs.

31:37.604 --> 31:40.023
I can't find Buntz.
You working with him today?

31:40.106 --> 31:42.692
-Yeah, he's not available right now.
-Lab report.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.070
-Stan, you have to know.
-Yeah?

31:46.154 --> 31:48.448
I'm helping a hooker make
her bail arrangements.

31:48.531 --> 31:49.657
Okay.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.285
Miss Davenport,
you have Vivian Dewitt, right?

31:52.368 --> 31:54.120
One of my most loyal customers.

31:54.203 --> 31:56.414
Will you do this for me? Give this to her.

31:56.497 --> 32:00.752
It's for her bail.
I need to help her get out.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.170
I'm gonna have to talk to her.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.132
(telephone rings)

32:10.345 --> 32:12.680
-Big guy's gone?
-He pretty much agreed to cooperate.

32:12.764 --> 32:15.850
Wait. What did you tell him? You
didn't tell him it was a police operation?

32:17.060 --> 32:18.311
No, I didn't.

32:20.104 --> 32:23.024
Otis isn't gonna see these dealers
before we move on them anyway.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.485
Hey, look, I got
a certain amount of exposure here.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.820
I'd just as soon we weren't advertising
to the public.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.697
The workup on those junkies.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.450
This stuff's about
as healthy as an H-bomb.

32:32.533 --> 32:34.953
"Immediate and long-term toxicity,

32:35.036 --> 32:36.871
seizures, Parkinsonism."

32:36.955 --> 32:38.706
Nobody said addiction is a picnic.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.625
(applauds) Tick-tock, guys.

32:40.708 --> 32:43.169
-We said we'd get back to them by 4:00.
-Alright, calm down.

32:43.252 --> 32:45.046
Sure. No problem.

32:46.965 --> 32:51.386
Okay, this is the associational part
of your sexometer chart.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.721
You say the first word
that pops into your mind

32:53.805 --> 32:55.807
when I say, "carrot."

32:56.349 --> 32:57.266
Celery.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.644
Fire hydrant.

32:59.727 --> 33:00.603
Dog.

33:01.187 --> 33:02.313
Chrysler Building.

33:02.855 --> 33:04.023
DeSoto.

33:04.107 --> 33:05.441
All of the above.

33:07.902 --> 33:10.279
John LaRue's shorts.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.490
Oh, God, Terry.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.325
(bell rings)

33:14.409 --> 33:17.745
Hey, baby. Leo's back.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.747
And ain't he lookin' good?

33:19.831 --> 33:23.126
Oh, yeah. Looking so nice.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.461
And who's the dude?

33:26.462 --> 33:28.965
Just somebody I'm buying
some equipment from.

33:29.048 --> 33:31.467
Hey, you mind waiting downstairs?
I won't be long.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.469
No problem.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.889
Real good sportsmanship.

33:47.775 --> 33:50.319
-TERRY: <i>You feeling right?</i>
-LEO:<i> Oh, yeah.</i>

33:51.571 --> 33:54.741
And I'm gonna need
a very special 'too today

33:54.824 --> 33:58.161
because I'm celebrating Mardi Gras
going on in my head.

33:58.244 --> 34:01.873
Is that right?
Were you a little wild today?

34:01.956 --> 34:04.751
Uh-huh. Very wild.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.628
Check this out.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.923
Leo, that is a cannon you got there.

34:11.799 --> 34:13.634
<i>Will you show that to some people today?</i>

34:13.718 --> 34:16.554
Maybe just to see the look in their eyes.

34:17.513 --> 34:20.183
Hey, lay back.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.143
-(sighs)
-Relax.

34:22.727 --> 34:27.148
Maybe I give you a... mermaid

34:27.231 --> 34:28.983
with a nice, long tail today.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.152
Oh, I deserve a mermaid

34:31.235 --> 34:33.571
because I've been a big boy.

34:33.654 --> 34:36.032
Big boy with a big score.

34:36.991 --> 34:39.911
Go for it. Come on, baby. Time and place.

34:39.994 --> 34:41.037
TERRY: <i>You do somebody?</i>

34:41.662 --> 34:43.372
Man, Leo, you gotta be careful.

34:46.459 --> 34:49.170
Who said that I did somebody?

34:51.005 --> 34:52.965
What's all these questions?

34:53.049 --> 34:54.759
I just don't want you in any trouble.

34:55.593 --> 34:58.429
You wouldn't be thinking
about dropping the dime

34:58.513 --> 35:00.139
on a lead, would you, terry?

35:00.223 --> 35:02.517
(chuckling)
Oh, what are you talking about?

35:02.600 --> 35:06.354
I'm talking about a whole lot
of questions, woman.

35:06.437 --> 35:10.274
-(pants) Hey.
-Maybe you're gonna turn me in, huh?

35:10.358 --> 35:11.776
TERRY:<i> Stop it. That hurts.</i>

35:11.859 --> 35:14.487
<i>Okay, look. Forget it.</i>
<i>I was just trying to be friendly.</i>

35:14.570 --> 35:15.530
The hell with it.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.157
That ain't friendly.

35:18.825 --> 35:21.953
When are they gonna
make a yard out of me, huh, bitch?

35:22.036 --> 35:23.996
Freeze! Police! You're under arrest!

35:24.580 --> 35:25.790
(shot)

35:35.967 --> 35:36.801
He's dead, baby.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.345
Oh. Oh!

35:39.428 --> 35:42.682
Oh! You jerks!

35:42.765 --> 35:44.684
You shot Salome!

35:44.767 --> 35:47.562
Are you all right? Come on, baby, come on.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.147
Come on, Ter. We'll take him to a vet.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.107
Get away from me! You shot her!

35:52.692 --> 35:55.236
We didn't mean to.
We were trying to protect you.

35:56.737 --> 36:00.366
Uh, I don't think it was John's fault,
Terry. I think it was my bullet got it.

36:00.449 --> 36:03.327
Both of you cops, you killed my snake!

36:03.411 --> 36:04.996
Salome's dead!

36:05.079 --> 36:08.541
(sobbing)

36:11.711 --> 36:14.297
I'm getting a real bad feeling.

36:14.380 --> 36:15.506
Calm down.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.216
(sighs)

36:19.760 --> 36:21.387
These guys want to move their product.

36:21.470 --> 36:24.098
If they don't show,
there's only one reason.

36:30.438 --> 36:33.232
How did Bobby sound on the phone
when you went to reconnect?

36:33.316 --> 36:34.609
Fine. So what?

36:36.319 --> 36:39.822
They make me for a snitch,
they ain't exactly gonna advertise.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.283
-Take it easy.
-Will you quit saying that?

36:43.117 --> 36:45.161
You ain't the one
who's gonna need surgery.

36:54.128 --> 36:56.172
All right, we're shutting down in here.

36:56.255 --> 36:58.257
Go out the back. I'll meet you in the car.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.885
We got that, 2202. We got a wrap here.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.558
-Right there, Otis!
-My brother's dead.

37:09.268 --> 37:11.729
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, he seized up and died.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.022
It was some kind of poison.

37:13.105 --> 37:16.192
Synthetic heroin. Look, Otis.
What are you doing here?

37:16.275 --> 37:19.362
-I live up here, man. Let me go.
-Hey. Look, there's nobody in there, okay?

37:19.445 --> 37:21.197
-I say I live up here.
-I don't believe you!

37:21.280 --> 37:23.908
-I don't believe that nobody's in there!
-Otis, damn it!

37:23.991 --> 37:25.284
BOTH: (grunting)

37:28.287 --> 37:30.706
Otis, you jerk. Now I gotta bust you!

37:30.790 --> 37:32.291
I gotta bust your parole!

37:36.879 --> 37:38.673
Hey! What is this?

37:38.756 --> 37:40.383
What's the problem here, Lieutenant?

37:41.050 --> 37:41.884
Ex-con with a gun.

37:41.968 --> 37:44.470
My brother died
because those people killed him!

37:44.553 --> 37:47.265
Look, those guys said their stash
is across the street.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.517
See if the bartender knows
where they were staying?

37:49.600 --> 37:50.851
I'll take care of this guy.

37:51.602 --> 37:54.146
-He hasn't been read his rights, Norm.
-All right, I got him.

37:56.691 --> 37:59.110
Boy, you're a slow learner,
aren't you, pal?

37:59.193 --> 38:00.903
Come on, get up. Come on!

38:02.780 --> 38:03.948
Let's go.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.957
Hey! Hey! Hey!

38:15.960 --> 38:19.088
Oh, this is wonderful. Now I gotta ride
shotgun to the paddy wagon?

38:19.171 --> 38:21.215
You don't understand.
I'm in trouble, Norm!

38:21.299 --> 38:22.800
Calm down. Shut up, huh?

38:24.051 --> 38:25.469
You're gonna hit me in the eye.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.187
(action music playing)

38:46.615 --> 38:49.076
That's your third warning here,
Miss Patterson.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.912
What's that supposed to mean,
third warning?

38:51.996 --> 38:53.581
You know, you got an attitude problem

38:53.664 --> 38:55.541
as well as a health problem,
Miss Patterson.

38:55.624 --> 39:00.254
So string me up, okay? Hang me. Gas me.
I'm a smoker. It's part of who I am.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.424
So is a $50 fine
and a mark on your jacket.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.509
I'm crucified. I'm bleeding.

39:05.593 --> 39:07.678
Let's not be getting blasphemous.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.764
It's a rule of law, Miss Patterson.

39:09.847 --> 39:13.017
We all gotta live by it. Plus, long-term,
it might do you some good.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.978
No, I don't have to live with it. You do.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.439
I'm sick of this fascist cesspool.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.816
I'm leaving, quit, gone.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.195
(telephone rings)

39:24.278 --> 39:25.654
White-haired old lady.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.156
(exhales)

39:27.239 --> 39:29.950
-(indistinct chatter)
-(telephone rings)

39:30.034 --> 39:32.745
Jablonski. Yes, Norman.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.915
What? Yeah, but you're okay?

39:37.208 --> 39:38.834
I'll get out an APB.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.962
Presumed armed and dangerous. Right.

39:42.046 --> 39:44.965
Miss Patterson. Oh, damn it. Melvin!

39:46.050 --> 39:49.011
Melvin, Lieutenant Buntz
just had a prisoner escape on him.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.055
The guy was here in custody earlier.

39:51.138 --> 39:53.724
Get his paper so we can get his name
and get out an APB.

39:53.808 --> 39:56.811
Perp's name is Otis Foster,

39:56.894 --> 39:59.688
-36-8-245.
-(telephone rings)

40:00.272 --> 40:01.941
Presumed armed and dangerous.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.777
-(telephone rings)
-Jablonski.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.988
Yeah. No kidding?

40:08.906 --> 40:11.826
-Yeah, well, thanks for the word, pal.
-Sarge.

40:11.909 --> 40:15.413
City Council just reinterpreted reg 333-C.

40:15.496 --> 40:17.456
We're not included.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.834
Do you want me to go get Celeste back?

40:20.835 --> 40:23.337
No. No, let her go.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.798
She wasn't that happy here anyway.

40:26.674 --> 40:30.719
(action music playing)

40:49.822 --> 40:53.325
Looks like this dealer's
from your undercover, Lieutenant.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.161
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.413
It's a pleasant sight, ain't it?

40:58.789 --> 41:00.166
Is your eye okay?

41:00.791 --> 41:03.752
Yeah. The guy, he hit me when he escaped.

41:12.511 --> 41:14.889
-Very delicious.
-Okay.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.558
You know, Joe,

41:17.641 --> 41:20.644
I'll probably like public
school better anyway.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.063
I don't think I can get used
to wearing no uniform.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.524
I think you'd look very cute in a uniform.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.568
A uniform don't help your looks.

41:27.651 --> 41:30.446
-Hey, watch that.
-(laughs)

41:32.448 --> 41:33.407
Where are you going?

41:33.491 --> 41:35.910
Uh, ice cream. I'll be right back.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.204
Luce, I just brought ice cream.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.331
Yeah, but not strawberry, okay?

41:40.414 --> 41:42.041
That's Fabian's favorite kind.

41:42.124 --> 41:44.668
So, it's his party.
I'll be back in a minute.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.128
Don't wreck the place, huh?

41:56.931 --> 42:01.018
-Thanks for making my bail.
-How much?

42:01.769 --> 42:05.231
You don't have to come on so hard.
I'm thinking about what's best

42:05.314 --> 42:08.317
-for everybody, same as you.
-You're just thinking about staying high.

42:10.152 --> 42:12.696
I need $2,000 cash.

42:14.281 --> 42:17.326
-Then you can have Fabian.
-I don't know if I can get that much cash.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.286
I ain't about to argue with you.

42:19.828 --> 42:21.956
That's what I need to take care of myself.

42:22.998 --> 42:25.501
Even if I can find that much,
how am I gonna know

42:25.584 --> 42:27.670
that you're not gonna come back
looking for more?

42:27.753 --> 42:30.965
I'll sign papers. You'd be his guardian.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.717
Then you will never see me no more.

42:34.969 --> 42:36.762
It better go that way,

42:36.845 --> 42:38.722
because if you try to hit
on me for more money,

42:38.806 --> 42:42.268
I'll make trouble for you
like you won't believe. You hear me?

42:43.185 --> 42:44.436
I ain't deaf.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.190
I gotta call my credit union.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.319
I gotta think about this.

42:52.987 --> 42:55.072
You can call me up tomorrow.
I'll let you know.

43:08.127 --> 43:09.795
(sighs)

43:12.214 --> 43:13.382
Let's hear it, Furillo.

43:17.303 --> 43:20.222
There was a time
what Daniels offered me today

43:20.306 --> 43:22.266
would have capped
every ambition I ever had.

43:24.476 --> 43:26.145
I'm wondering if it shouldn't still.

43:26.228 --> 43:29.315
(telephone rings)

43:31.817 --> 43:34.528
Hello? Yeah. Oh, hi, Graham.

43:36.697 --> 43:39.908
It was very gratifying. I didn't know
that many people still read the papers.

43:41.744 --> 43:44.246
No, Joyce is right here.
I'll check with her.

43:45.998 --> 43:47.708
Are we free on the 15th?

43:48.500 --> 43:49.960
Of which month?

43:51.086 --> 43:52.588
15th's fine, Graham.

43:53.422 --> 43:54.965
No, she's looking forward.

43:57.176 --> 43:58.844
Well, sure. Yeah.

43:58.927 --> 44:02.097
Yeah. Of course. We'll talk beforehand.

44:02.181 --> 44:03.098
Of course not.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.141
(chuckles)

44:05.726 --> 44:06.644
Good night.

44:08.729 --> 44:10.981
The illustrious Mr. Wells.

44:11.065 --> 44:13.192
The thing about Graham
is everything's "we."

44:13.275 --> 44:16.445
"We have to start thinking about this."
We have to cultivate that."

44:17.154 --> 44:19.239
Where are we going on the 15th?

44:19.323 --> 44:22.201
-He wants us for dinner.
-(laughs)

44:22.284 --> 44:23.494
What?

44:24.244 --> 44:27.331
Nothing. It's just,
it was just the way you said it.

44:27.414 --> 44:29.958
It sounds like he wants to eat us.

44:30.042 --> 44:31.293
(laughing)

44:31.377 --> 44:34.213
I have lost women
by drinking, by lying, by cheating.

44:34.296 --> 44:37.341
I have never lost a woman
because I shot her snake.

44:37.424 --> 44:39.468
That's the excitement of cop work, lover.

44:39.551 --> 44:41.303
Shoot something new every day of the week.

44:41.387 --> 44:43.097
You got an inappropriate sense of humor.

44:43.180 --> 44:46.058
There was a deep, sensual attraction
between me and that woman.

44:46.141 --> 44:48.519
(chuckles)
All I know is I never liked that snake.

44:49.770 --> 44:54.566
-(indistinct chatter)
-(rock music playing on the stereo)

45:00.698 --> 45:02.282
Well, Phantom of the Opera.

45:02.366 --> 45:03.617
(laughs)

45:03.701 --> 45:06.412
Oh, funny, huh? I got this silly hang-up

45:06.495 --> 45:08.956
with trying to keep my face
attached to the rest of my body.

45:10.582 --> 45:12.000
Quit worrying, Sid.

45:12.084 --> 45:13.836
Your two pals are off the roster.

45:13.919 --> 45:15.838
Bobby and Darnell? What happened?

45:16.296 --> 45:17.589
Somebody croaked them.

45:19.466 --> 45:23.512
Would I be wrong in guessing that it was
a certain large, colored person?

45:23.595 --> 45:25.055
Still being investigated.

45:25.639 --> 45:27.850
Here. There's only $50 there.

45:27.933 --> 45:30.769
Yeah, and I bet the other buck and a half

45:30.853 --> 45:32.229
went for plane fare, am I right?

45:32.312 --> 45:35.482
-What, are you writing a book?
-No. Lieutenant.

45:36.233 --> 45:37.443
Lieutenant.

45:37.526 --> 45:38.986
Excuse us, Sid.

45:39.069 --> 45:40.404
I was just leaving.

45:40.487 --> 45:42.614
This is a stand-up individual.

45:42.698 --> 45:44.575
-Take off.
-Good night.

45:46.869 --> 45:49.496
So, what's doing, Lieutenant?

45:49.580 --> 45:51.498
Protect your man, Norm?

45:51.582 --> 45:54.626
-What do you mean?
-All we could do was bust him.

45:55.753 --> 45:57.546
Sid gets made, that's not good enough.

45:58.881 --> 46:01.258
-I'm not following you.
-Don't insult me, Norm.

46:02.217 --> 46:03.385
You let Otis escape.

46:05.012 --> 46:07.389
D'you tell him where he could look
for Bobby and Darnell,

46:07.473 --> 46:09.558
-or did you just hope he'd find them?
-Look.

46:09.641 --> 46:11.852
The man hit me in the eye. He got away.

46:11.935 --> 46:14.188
If you're asking am I sorry
these two guys are dead

46:14.271 --> 46:16.982
and my informant's protected,
the answer is no.

46:18.650 --> 46:20.319
-Don't do that.
-I don't care what you do

46:20.402 --> 46:21.612
when I'm not around.

46:21.695 --> 46:23.822
If I'm part of it,
I want to know the play.

46:26.992 --> 46:28.702
-My mistake.
-Your mistake.

46:36.418 --> 46:37.461
(clears throat)

46:42.591 --> 46:44.092
If I don't get into Mercy,

46:44.176 --> 46:47.805
I'm gonna apply to every nursing school
within 100 miles of you.

46:47.888 --> 46:48.931
You better.

46:59.608 --> 47:01.652
I feel like we kissed
inside a church today.

47:02.444 --> 47:04.947
Do you know what the best thing
about Reggie Hill was?

47:06.657 --> 47:08.992
He had a lot of faults, but...

47:09.076 --> 47:11.286
I think he would have been happy
for me today.

47:12.204 --> 47:13.747
(laughs)

47:13.831 --> 47:17.960
