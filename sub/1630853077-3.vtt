WEBVTT

01:08.569 --> 01:09.570
Thank you.

01:09.653 --> 01:10.988
It looks great on you.

01:12.364 --> 01:15.158
- Here is your onboarding packet.
- Okay.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.286
- Your directory.
- Okay.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.705
Here is this.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.875
And remember,
the staff meeting is at 7:00 p.m. tonight.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.334
The "Thank God It's Monday" meeting?

01:24.418 --> 01:27.921
Girl, they're epic.
Literally the best part of my week.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.339
How long have you worked here?

01:30.382 --> 01:31.508
Four weeks?

01:31.592 --> 01:32.759
No, five.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.514
- Welcome to WeWork.
- Thank you.

01:40.017 --> 01:43.103
Welcome! Welcome!
Thank you! Thank you for being here.

01:43.187 --> 01:45.814
Yes. Welcome!

01:45.898 --> 01:48.150
Do you see that sign back there?
What does it say?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.903
- Hustle harder!
- Hustle harder!

01:50.986 --> 01:52.613
Now, for all the new faces,

01:52.696 --> 01:55.908
let the rest of the world
give thanks on Friday.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.618
Here at WeWork, we say…

01:57.701 --> 01:59.786
"Thank God it's Monday!"

01:59.870 --> 02:02.581
Yes! Thank God it's Monday!

02:02.664 --> 02:05.501
I say "we," you say "work."

02:05.584 --> 02:06.877
- We!
- Work!

02:06.960 --> 02:08.002
- We!
- Work!

02:08.086 --> 02:09.128
- We!
- Work!

02:09.213 --> 02:10.380
- We!
- Work!

02:10.464 --> 02:11.423
- We!
- Work!

02:11.507 --> 02:12.716
- We!
- Work!

02:12.799 --> 02:14.301
- Come on!
- Work!

02:14.384 --> 02:16.845
Hey!

02:33.487 --> 02:35.489
I say "we," you say "work!"

02:35.572 --> 02:36.573
- We!
- Work!

02:36.657 --> 02:37.783
- We!
- Work!

03:08.730 --> 03:09.857
- We!
- Work!

03:09.940 --> 03:10.941
- We!
- Work!

03:11.024 --> 03:12.067
- We!
- Work!

03:12.150 --> 03:13.318
- We!
- Work!

03:13.402 --> 03:14.820
- We!
- Work!

03:14.903 --> 03:16.113
- We!
- Work!

03:16.196 --> 03:17.406
- We!
- Work!

03:17.489 --> 03:18.657
- We!
- Work!

04:27.309 --> 04:29.937
Her last poopie was a little solid,

04:30.020 --> 04:32.481
so maybe a counter-clockwise
stomach massage.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.358
Gentle. Okay.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.319
Mommy loves you. Mommy loves you.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.780
- Hey, Adam. Adam. Adam.
- I love you so-- Bye.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.658
Adam, I'm so sorry,
but we are three hours late

04:42.741 --> 04:44.284
and the crowd is getting restless.

04:44.368 --> 04:46.828
The flower always blooms in the spring.
Let's go!

04:46.912 --> 04:48.205
Let's go! Come on!

04:50.374 --> 04:52.292
- Is everything okay?
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.253
- My dad just keeps calling. It's fine.
- Your dad?

04:54.336 --> 04:55.712
So, this is Damian Saito.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.924
- He is the reporter doing that piece.
- Hi.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.008
- Hi.
- Damian!

05:00.092 --> 05:03.136
Damian, my brother. This will be
the best piece you ever wrote!

05:03.220 --> 05:05.013
You'll win the Pulitzer. Okay?

05:05.097 --> 05:06.306
You just tell me what you need.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.684
- Vanessa! Whatever he needs.
- Yes. Whatever you need.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.310
- Thank you.
- The New York Times.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.354
The Times canceled.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.523
Maybe we can meet tonight.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.776
- Baby. Hey, hey.
- We need to embrace each other.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.152
You're a supernova.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.114
- My love.
- My love.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.116
Okay.

05:24.199 --> 05:27.870
Welcome to the stage the main attraction,

05:27.953 --> 05:28.954
Adam Neumann!

05:29.037 --> 05:30.956
Yes, yes, yes!

05:31.039 --> 05:33.292
Yes! Welcome!

05:34.293 --> 05:37.921
Welcome to Summer Camp!

05:40.340 --> 05:41.383
Daddy?

05:41.466 --> 05:43.760
- Look around you.
- I have to call you back.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.470
The most amazing thing is happeni--

05:45.554 --> 05:47.222
This is what tomorrow looks like.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.766
No more TGIF.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.226
- When you do what you love…
- What?

05:51.310 --> 05:53.103
…work is play.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.523
And we say…

05:56.607 --> 05:59.985
Thank God it's Monday!

06:01.153 --> 06:02.654
We love you!

06:03.947 --> 06:06.116
We love you too. We do.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.786
It's been an amazing year.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.289
Can I call you
when I get back to the city?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.124
Okay, but I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna…

06:14.917 --> 06:16.418
I will write it as soon as I ge--

06:17.252 --> 06:22.174
…and very smart, investments from our
committed partners at Benchmark Capital,

06:22.257 --> 06:28.388
we now have over 1.5 million square feet

06:28.472 --> 06:31.642
of WeWork space!

06:33.227 --> 06:36.688
And over 10,000 members.

06:38.232 --> 06:41.318
So I think we deserve
to celebrate a little bit, huh?

06:42.778 --> 06:44.404
Or maybe a lot!

06:45.364 --> 06:46.740
Maybe a lot!

06:47.658 --> 06:50.202
Maybe a lot!

06:50.994 --> 06:53.956
Daddy, we're gonna fix this.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.416
Okay?
We're gonna get through this. I promise.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.210
Speaking of partners,

06:59.169 --> 07:04.091
this amazing setting is my beautiful wife,
Rebekah's, family's property,

07:04.174 --> 07:06.051
so let's all thank her.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.261
Rebekah!

07:07.803 --> 07:10.472
Rebekah! Come, come!

07:11.056 --> 07:13.350
She's going to make me come get her.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.477
- No. Adam.
- Rebekah, come, come, come!

07:15.561 --> 07:18.105
- Daddy, I have to call you back, okay?
- Come.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.398
Here she is.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.775
Say something. Say something!

07:21.859 --> 07:22.860
No, it's yours.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.572
Hi!

07:28.574 --> 07:33.912
Welcome to this beautiful s--

07:34.621 --> 07:36.373
I mean, this actually is a summer camp.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.837
It's owned by my cousin Mark's family.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.797
Mark!

07:43.881 --> 07:44.882
Is Mark here?

07:45.591 --> 07:46.925
Mark, are you…

07:48.302 --> 07:50.637
Is-- Oh, well…

07:51.513 --> 07:54.016
Adi? Adi!

07:54.099 --> 07:57.144
Adi! Adam's sister is here, everyone.

07:58.770 --> 08:02.566
Adi, thank you so much for helping Adam

08:02.649 --> 08:04.276
when he first got here.

08:05.277 --> 08:09.281
I'm so grateful that you took care of him.

08:09.990 --> 08:14.036
You helped him build
the biggest family in the world.

08:16.288 --> 08:17.915
All right!

08:20.751 --> 08:24.421
A big part of being a woman
is to help men.

08:24.505 --> 08:25.881
What?

08:25.964 --> 08:30.594
A big part of being a woman is
to help men manifest their calling.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.846
- That's what I've tried to do with Adam.
- Fuck.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.097
And you have.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.892
So, anyway, I made a lot of memories here…

08:36.975 --> 08:37.976
Come on.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.062
"Founder's wife says
a woman's role is to help men,

08:40.145 --> 08:41.897
quote, 'manifest their calling in life.'"

08:41.980 --> 08:43.148
Thank you.

08:44.733 --> 08:48.153
Give me a break. She is a new mother.
She's barely sleeping.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.655
- Don't be a dick.
- She said it.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.323
Yeah, and that's not the story here.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.159
- What is the story?
- The story is-- Look at this!

08:54.243 --> 08:57.371
Thousands of employees
and members celebrating together.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.998
There is something so special happening
at WeWork.

09:00.082 --> 09:02.793
I mean, you pitched me
on covering Summer Camp, so cover it.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.336
- We!
- Work!

09:04.419 --> 09:06.630
I say "we," you say "work"!

09:06.713 --> 09:08.048
- We!
- Work!

09:08.131 --> 09:09.132
- We!
- Work!

09:09.216 --> 09:10.133
- We!
- Work!

09:10.217 --> 09:11.343
- We!
- Work!

09:11.426 --> 09:12.469
- We!
- Work!

09:12.553 --> 09:13.637
Everybody scream!

09:18.016 --> 09:19.601
That thing you said

09:19.685 --> 09:23.230
about how a woman's role is
to help a man manifest his own destiny.

09:23.313 --> 09:27.776
- Yeah.
- We might want to clarify that.

09:27.860 --> 09:31.029
I don't understand what was wrong with it.
I thought it was sweet.

09:31.113 --> 09:34.241
Well, it might be perceived
as anti-feminist.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.410
Anti-- No, no.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.204
I brought The Vagina Monologues
to Cornell my senior year.

09:39.288 --> 09:41.999
I can't even remember what Rebekah said.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.294
Okay, well, the reporter
is gonna remember.

09:45.377 --> 09:46.879
Well, he's a style reporter.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.715
I know, but it doesn't matter.
You have to set the record straight.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.967
No, no. Vanessa.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.887
My wife doesn't have to do a thing, okay?

09:55.596 --> 09:59.141
You're the head of comms.
You're the genius.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.101
Fix it.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.355
We love you, Adam!

10:05.439 --> 10:07.774
Hey!

10:08.275 --> 10:11.320
I love you more! I love you more!

10:11.403 --> 10:13.655
Hey!

10:13.739 --> 10:16.825
Wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

10:16.909 --> 10:18.869
Is that the bounce house?

10:22.497 --> 10:25.542
- Can we just go to the cabin?
- Yeah, we should just go.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.420
- The bounce house!
- Okay.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.854
Nice little cabin.

10:46.563 --> 10:47.564
Thank you.

10:47.648 --> 10:51.360
You can put the small bag in the nursery
and the two large bags in the master.

10:58.867 --> 10:59.993
Keith!

11:02.788 --> 11:07.000
Rebekah! Don't bother your brother!
Let him rest!

11:07.084 --> 11:08.961
Keith! Keith!

11:09.044 --> 11:12.047
Keith, Keith!
I got to the eighth level in Zelda!

11:12.130 --> 11:14.049
- I learned all eight spells.
- Bullshit.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.717
No, it's true! I saved the game!

11:15.801 --> 11:17.052
RebiRules is now top score.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.638
But if I erase it, no one will know.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.057
Keith, don't. No.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.226
- Hey.
- No!

12:50.145 --> 12:53.690
You know, it's okay to cry.

12:58.946 --> 12:59.947
Rivka!

13:01.240 --> 13:03.575
- You up there?
- I'm up here. Yeah. I'm up here.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.289
Shalom, baba ghanoush!

13:09.373 --> 13:12.209
They're going crazy out there.
Like a pack of wolves.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.920
Oh, my God. Where's-- There it is.

13:16.588 --> 13:17.589
Perfect.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.550
Perfect. Come on, get dressed.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.469
We have a big night.

13:22.553 --> 13:23.887
Honey, I'm not gonna go tonight.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.764
- You're coming.
- No, I really can't.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.015
- You're coming.
- No.

13:27.099 --> 13:29.184
We have a night nurse, a day nurse…

13:29.268 --> 13:30.936
- I can't.
- …a fridge full of boob milk.

13:31.019 --> 13:34.398
- You're coming.
- No. Honey. I can't.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.941
You're coming.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.609
I'm not taking no for an answer.

13:42.281 --> 13:43.657
How could you resist?

13:45.576 --> 13:47.828
What? Too much?

13:48.704 --> 13:52.583
Dance with me under the stars
until the sun rises.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.757
Come, come, come. Dance with me.
Dance with me!

14:03.844 --> 14:05.012
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.555
And guess what I have here.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.266
Your magic glasses.

14:13.228 --> 14:15.022
Can you hear them out there?

14:15.105 --> 14:17.649
Like wolves. We can howl at the moon.

15:14.206 --> 15:15.541
I'm gonna go!

15:17.125 --> 15:18.293
I'm gonna go.

15:19.503 --> 15:21.213
- I'm gonna head back.
- No, no.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.715
You can't leave a silent disco.
It's bad luck.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.260
- No. Stay, stay.
- Can you stop? Please, stop.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.511
- Stay, stay!
- Stop, stop.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.347
- Hey, wait. What's wrong?
- Honey.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.015
It's no--

15:32.099 --> 15:35.561
What's wrong? Talk to me. Talk to me.

15:35.644 --> 15:37.604
I talked to my dad. He's in trouble.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.941
- What? What kind of trouble?
- He's in some…

15:41.984 --> 15:43.610
- Legal trouble.
- Legal--

15:43.694 --> 15:44.903
- It's just--
- What did he do?

15:47.281 --> 15:49.324
He didn't do anything.

15:49.408 --> 15:51.493
It was a mistake. It was a mix-up.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.495
- Jesus Christ. This is fucking…
- Okay.

15:53.579 --> 15:56.373
Okay, okay. Tell me--
Tell me what happened.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.001
Some stupid accountant
fucked up something on his tax returns,

15:59.084 --> 16:00.878
they've charged him
with some bullshit tax thing,

16:00.961 --> 16:02.462
and he said he could go to prison.

16:02.546 --> 16:06.425
And he wants me to write him some kind
of character reference in a letter.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.177
- I don't really know. Anyway--
- Wait.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.762
- I need to go to sleep.
- No. I'm coming with you.

16:10.846 --> 16:11.847
No, no.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.141
- I'm coming with you. We'll go together.
- You're gonna stay.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.059
I'll make some cocoa.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.604
You are gonna stay.
You are gonna have fun.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.815
You have planned this for months.
All right?

16:21.899 --> 16:23.275
And they want you to stay.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.153
Okay?

16:29.031 --> 16:30.032
There you go.

16:33.327 --> 16:35.913
I gotta go.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.415
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you.

16:40.626 --> 16:41.960
We'll figure this out.

16:43.879 --> 16:46.798
I'll be thinking about you.
Not a big deal.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.759
Oh, yeah!

16:48.842 --> 16:52.012
Go, Adam! Go, Adam! Go, Adam!

16:52.095 --> 16:55.015
Go, Adam! Go, Adam! Go, Adam!

16:55.098 --> 16:59.353
Go, Adam! Go, Adam! Go, Adam!

16:59.436 --> 17:01.438
She's doing all women a disservice.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.815
Oh, my God, that's it. I mean--

17:03.899 --> 17:06.276
She isn't going to apologize.
She never does.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.361
It's just--

17:12.449 --> 17:13.492
Bye!

17:14.576 --> 17:15.868
Got the picture.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.496
Oh, my God!

17:31.927 --> 17:35.013
Aaron, I'm just saying
just think about it. Okay?

17:35.097 --> 17:39.101
We just accept
whatever society tells us is normal.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.519
I eat bacon 'cause it's delicious.

17:40.602 --> 17:43.146
- Not because society tells me to.
- You think suffering is delicious?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.816
'Cause that's what you're eating.
Suffering. And it's everywhere.

17:45.899 --> 17:49.027
- McDonald's cooks its fries in beef--
- Jesus! Not everything is some big thing.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.529
Where are you going?

17:51.113 --> 17:52.281
I'm gonna take off.

17:52.364 --> 17:55.909
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We don't have to talk about that stuff.

17:55.993 --> 17:57.202
I gotta get going.

17:57.286 --> 18:00.038
No, stay the night. You can tell
your parents you're at Jonah's.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.623
No more gross stuff.

18:01.707 --> 18:04.543
No more gross stuff.
We could do fun stuff.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.253
Yeah? What would Bob and Evelyn say?

18:06.336 --> 18:07.880
They don't get home till next week.

18:08.964 --> 18:12.301
They're still gone? My parents
won't leave me alone for a night.

18:12.384 --> 18:13.635
I'm not alone.

18:16.013 --> 18:17.014
Yes?

18:17.097 --> 18:18.974
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

19:41.849 --> 19:43.892
- Hi, Rebekah.
- Vanessa. Thank goodness.

19:43.976 --> 19:46.770
We need more vegan options
at the food station. I don't eat meat.

19:46.854 --> 19:49.022
- I will have some--
- It's not a choice. It's a lifestyle.

19:49.106 --> 19:50.816
Just smelling meat makes me very upset.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.901
Of course. That's not my job, but--

19:55.195 --> 19:57.990
I don't-- What happened?
The sign-up sheet was full.

19:58.073 --> 20:01.577
Right, this is what I was trying
to tell you. No one is coming.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.161
Why?

20:03.245 --> 20:04.788
Because there's been a boycott.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.416
Of yoga?

20:07.499 --> 20:10.127
No, of, "A big part of being a woman is

20:10.210 --> 20:12.379
to help men manifest
their calling in life."

20:13.714 --> 20:16.633
So legal has called a meeting.
We have to head back up to the house.

20:19.887 --> 20:22.389
I tried to text you. I-- Okay.

20:22.472 --> 20:25.184
I said I support my husband. Sue me.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.394
Lawsuits are nothing to joke about.

20:28.979 --> 20:30.856
This is very serious, Rebekah.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.276
Who are you?

20:34.860 --> 20:36.570
Jen's out. I'm deputy in-house counsel.

20:36.653 --> 20:40.032
Okay. I think we should wait for Adam.
When's he getting here?

20:40.115 --> 20:41.742
No. They sent me instead.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.119
I'm here.

20:44.203 --> 20:46.914
- He's Jet Ski jousting.
- Someone challenged him.

20:47.748 --> 20:50.667
Okay, so, you pissed off the millennials.

20:50.751 --> 20:52.503
Well, they're sensitive about everything.

20:52.586 --> 20:55.297
Call 'em microaggressions now.
They find them triggering.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.883
- Bunch of babies.
- With social media accounts. So…

20:57.966 --> 21:00.886
I wouldn't say that. I think
they're trying to make space at the table

21:00.969 --> 21:03.722
for people who don't look
just like them. So…

21:03.805 --> 21:04.848
They value empathy.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.225
Empathy? Empathy?

21:06.308 --> 21:08.894
- This is empathy? Are you seriou--
- You see, Rebekah,

21:08.977 --> 21:10.562
as the wife of the founder,

21:10.646 --> 21:13.774
you have to choose your words
very carefully.

21:13.857 --> 21:17.861
The millennials are very online.
This sort of thing can spread.

21:17.945 --> 21:18.946
It will go viral.

21:19.029 --> 21:21.740
Yep, we gotta keep it 100.
Otherwise, it's "Bye, Felicia."

21:23.450 --> 21:24.660
They're teaching me things.

21:27.037 --> 21:30.541
It could be very damaging to our brand.

21:30.624 --> 21:33.544
I mean, do you understand?
We can't lose the millennials.

21:33.627 --> 21:35.838
- We need them.
- Why?

21:35.921 --> 21:39.299
Because they work 80 hours a week
for free beer and T-shirts.

21:39.383 --> 21:40.968
No, that's--

21:41.051 --> 21:42.886
I-- I'm sorry.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.930
This whole thing is ridiculous. I don't…

21:45.013 --> 21:48.183
Ridiculous or not,
this sort of thing can gain momentum.

21:48.267 --> 21:51.228
A few playful comments here,
a few lapses in judgment there,

21:51.311 --> 21:53.939
and all of a sudden, they're making
a mountain out of a molehill.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.400
Next thing you know,
you've got gender discrimination,

21:56.483 --> 21:58.485
you've got hostile work environment,

21:58.569 --> 22:00.654
you've got sexual harassment.

22:03.615 --> 22:05.993
We need to squash this. Now.

22:06.076 --> 22:07.911
Did you take care of that story?

22:07.995 --> 22:09.037
I tried.

22:12.040 --> 22:16.170
So, we want you to put out a statement.

22:17.713 --> 22:18.714
"We"?

22:20.007 --> 22:21.216
Yes.

22:22.259 --> 22:24.761
Adam wants me to put out a statement?

22:27.764 --> 22:28.765
Yeah.

22:29.558 --> 22:31.768
Guys, we talked about this
at the pre-meeting.

22:35.063 --> 22:36.064
No.

22:36.148 --> 22:38.317
- Oh, come on. Please.
- The statement's already written.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.568
No! Listen--

22:39.651 --> 22:40.944
No, I don't wanna talk.

22:41.028 --> 22:43.572
I wanna listen.
I wanna hear their truth, okay?

22:43.655 --> 22:45.073
Can you set that up? Can you?

22:45.157 --> 22:48.202
If you don't mind, I have to go
deal with something that actually matters.

22:50.287 --> 22:51.955
She wants to "hear their truth."

22:52.456 --> 22:53.874
That went very well.

23:17.689 --> 23:20.150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:20.234 --> 23:21.235
Hey.

23:22.236 --> 23:24.446
It's just--
It seemed like the thing to do.

23:24.530 --> 23:28.992
All of my friends were getting jobs
on Wall Street. And…

23:29.076 --> 23:31.286
- I thought--
- Hey. Hey.

23:31.370 --> 23:34.456
Some people waste their entire lives
doing something they hate.

23:36.667 --> 23:37.668
Come on.

23:39.711 --> 23:42.130
So, what do you wanna do next?

23:42.214 --> 23:43.966
What's gonna make you happy?

23:52.266 --> 23:53.559
I wanna act.

23:58.397 --> 23:59.398
Like Gwynnie?

24:03.235 --> 24:04.528
I know. It's stupid, right?

24:04.611 --> 24:07.281
Says who? No. Hey, you were terrific
in your school plays.

24:07.364 --> 24:09.825
You always had talent. More than Gwynnie.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.451
- Lie.
- Truth.

24:11.535 --> 24:14.079
I never really believed
her head was in that box.

24:17.791 --> 24:21.837
The thing is, I'd have to move to LA.

24:23.589 --> 24:29.052
And I'd need headshots,
and there's this amazing acting teacher.

24:29.136 --> 24:30.137
But--

24:31.430 --> 24:33.432
- But it's expensive, so--
- So?

24:35.976 --> 24:38.145
I know things have been tight
since the divorce.

24:38.228 --> 24:39.980
Have I ever not provided for you?

24:40.063 --> 24:43.567
- I just don't want--
- Have I ever not provided for you?

24:43.650 --> 24:44.902
I'm sorry I brought it up.

24:44.985 --> 24:47.362
Who took you and all your friends
to Amsterdam for your birthday?

24:47.446 --> 24:48.655
Who else's father did that?

24:48.739 --> 24:49.907
I said I'm sorry!

24:57.456 --> 24:58.665
- Hey, Fran?
- Dad…

25:01.251 --> 25:02.628
Go pick up some champagne.

25:03.921 --> 25:05.839
My daughter's gonna win an Oscar.

25:18.977 --> 25:19.978
Aaron?

25:21.104 --> 25:23.023
Aaron! Aaron, I don't understand wha--

25:23.106 --> 25:26.109
I told you, I can't take the pressure
of all of this. The weight is too much!

25:26.193 --> 25:27.611
- What pressure? What weight?
- Of you!

25:27.694 --> 25:29.154
- I love you!
- No.

25:29.238 --> 25:31.240
- No, no, no.
- Stop, stop.

25:31.323 --> 25:33.784
Just stay! No! No! N--

25:35.369 --> 25:36.578
Shit.

25:39.289 --> 25:40.457
Are you okay?

25:43.252 --> 25:45.921
Please don't leave me.
Please don't leave me. Please don't!

25:46.004 --> 25:47.714
No, I can't be alone anymore! Aaron, no.

25:47.798 --> 25:50.008
No, no, no. No! Aaron! No!

25:50.092 --> 25:51.969
Please. No. No. I--

26:28.922 --> 26:31.675
A proper pot of coffee
in a copper coffee pot.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.928
A proper pot of coffee
in a copper coffee pot.

26:35.721 --> 26:39.892
A proper pot of coffee
in a copper coffee pot.

26:40.434 --> 26:41.852
Take your own cue.

26:52.905 --> 26:54.740
Let's put on some music.

26:55.324 --> 26:56.325
I gotta go.

26:56.408 --> 26:59.328
Aaron! Why? What happened?

26:59.411 --> 27:02.789
I told you,
I can't take the pressure of all this.

27:02.873 --> 27:04.499
- The weight--
- Wh--

27:04.583 --> 27:06.293
What pressure? What weight?

27:06.376 --> 27:07.669
Of you.

27:09.296 --> 27:10.464
I love you!

27:11.215 --> 27:13.592
It doesn't feel like love.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.677
Let's stop for a moment.

27:22.851 --> 27:24.269
Why do you think I stopped you?

27:24.353 --> 27:26.021
Because it was bad.

27:26.104 --> 27:27.606
Correct. Yes.

27:28.148 --> 27:29.566
And why was it bad?

27:31.276 --> 27:36.156
Because Chris's performance felt pushed?

27:40.035 --> 27:42.204
What is the point of this exercise?

27:42.287 --> 27:43.664
To revisit a trauma from our past.

27:43.747 --> 27:49.378
No, to reframe a trauma from our past
so that we can make it work for us.

27:49.461 --> 27:50.754
What is the trauma here?

27:51.505 --> 27:53.507
Aaron broke up with me.

27:53.590 --> 27:56.301
- Was he the love of your life?
- An-- No.

27:56.385 --> 27:58.011
Let's find another trauma.

28:08.564 --> 28:11.775
I've had a very fortunate life.

28:13.026 --> 28:16.989
How was your relationship
with your parents? Your family?

28:17.072 --> 28:20.033
They've given me everything I ever wanted.

28:21.201 --> 28:23.662
So, what happened
after you broke up with Aaron?

28:24.788 --> 28:25.914
Not much. We--

28:27.374 --> 28:32.212
We didn't really talk because
he started dating a friend of mine…

28:32.296 --> 28:34.506
- Wait. He dated your friend?
- …so it was like--

28:34.590 --> 28:37.092
Was she a close friend?

28:39.011 --> 28:40.262
Yes.

28:40.345 --> 28:41.430
Was she your best friend?

28:44.558 --> 28:48.729
- Yes.
- That had to feel like a betrayal.

28:48.812 --> 28:49.813
I…

28:50.981 --> 28:53.066
I guess, a li-- a little bit.

28:53.150 --> 28:55.611
Okay, so let's reframe this experience!

28:55.694 --> 28:59.948
Aaron is the love of your life.
He cheated on you with your best friend.

29:00.032 --> 29:01.408
They both betrayed you!

29:01.491 --> 29:04.995
Now, tell me how it felt
when Aaron broke up with you.

29:06.330 --> 29:11.001
I felt sad, and…

29:14.213 --> 29:15.923
and alone.

29:16.006 --> 29:18.300
Why are you holding back?
I want you to feel it!

29:18.383 --> 29:19.384
I…

29:20.928 --> 29:23.055
It hurt.

29:25.724 --> 29:28.101
In my chest. It was so tight!

29:31.522 --> 29:36.568
But I didn't cry, because I was too angry
at them for leaving me,

29:36.652 --> 29:38.654
and-- and-- and for the betrayal,

29:38.737 --> 29:41.573
and for the lies,
for all the goddamn lies!

29:41.657 --> 29:44.993
Now!
Now, make that your truth. Live in it.

29:48.789 --> 29:50.874
You fucked my best friend!

29:52.709 --> 29:55.754
You think I wouldn't find out?
Do you think I'm an idiot?

29:55.838 --> 29:58.465
Rebekah, I'm sorry I did that!

29:59.842 --> 30:01.051
Oh, G--

30:03.136 --> 30:06.306
Why are men so fucking disappointing?

30:10.018 --> 30:12.187
Now, that is the truth.

30:18.902 --> 30:21.864
So, you don't see how
what you said was anti-feminist?

30:22.489 --> 30:24.741
No. You misinterpreted the mean--

30:24.825 --> 30:28.787
If we misinterpreted what you said,
then why are you apologizing?

30:28.871 --> 30:31.665
I'm not apologizing. I'm contextualizing.

30:31.748 --> 30:32.833
You're not?

30:32.916 --> 30:35.085
I know everyone has a lot to say,

30:35.169 --> 30:37.421
but let's give Rebekah a chance
to speak too.

30:37.504 --> 30:39.673
I thought this was a listening session.

30:39.756 --> 30:41.633
Absolutely. And the listening,
it goes both ways.

30:41.717 --> 30:44.803
You know what?
It doesn't matter what I intended, what--

30:44.887 --> 30:48.348
We're a family, and in a family,
what matters is how I made you feel.

30:48.432 --> 30:50.684
So, I'd like to focus on that.

30:52.644 --> 30:58.567
I know something that has always helped me
is choosing what truth I live in.

30:58.650 --> 31:04.072
Right? I am responsible for my anger,
my sadness.

31:04.156 --> 31:08.952
You can't let yourself be defined
by negative emotions.

31:09.036 --> 31:13.207
Wait, so are you saying that if you said
something that makes us feel bad,

31:13.290 --> 31:15.250
then it's our fault?

31:16.251 --> 31:18.253
- Yes. Tha--
- What?

31:18.337 --> 31:20.297
Oh, my God.

31:20.380 --> 31:22.716
Do you not see how fucked up that is?

31:22.799 --> 31:24.384
It's-- No, I think--

31:24.468 --> 31:26.470
I-- Okay, I think you misinterpreted
what I was--

31:26.553 --> 31:28.388
No, no. Everyone, please, please.

31:28.472 --> 31:30.182
Okay. Excus-- Why are you leaving?

31:30.265 --> 31:31.934
Because this is not helpful.

31:32.017 --> 31:35.521
Okay. Okay, you talk, I'll listen.

31:35.604 --> 31:37.397
Look, I'm not afraid to lose my job,

31:37.481 --> 31:40.609
so I'm gonna say
what everyone else here is thinking.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.736
WeWork is a really bad place to work.

31:42.819 --> 31:44.821
- Yeah.
- Especially for women.

31:45.989 --> 31:47.574
So, why-- Why would…

31:47.658 --> 31:48.951
Why would you say that?

31:49.535 --> 31:52.162
Well, we have to stay up until
three o'clock in the morning, drinking,

31:52.246 --> 31:53.705
just so we can be a part of the team.

31:53.789 --> 31:54.915
Well, I'm sure that's--

31:54.998 --> 31:58.293
And we're paid like it's a start-up,
but it's not a start-up anymore.

31:58.377 --> 32:00.003
You flew here in a helicopter.

32:00.754 --> 32:03.715
We want real wages.

32:03.799 --> 32:07.261
It's always met with stock options.
Like, "stock options this, stock"--

32:07.344 --> 32:10.973
Yeah, and stock options mean
that you're an owner in the company.

32:12.015 --> 32:13.767
You get to choose your own destiny.

32:13.851 --> 32:17.521
If I own the company,
I pay people overtime.

32:17.604 --> 32:20.023
My friend said that she was asked
if she planned on getting pregnant

32:20.107 --> 32:21.358
during her interview here.

32:21.441 --> 32:23.318
- I heard that too.
- Seriou--

32:23.402 --> 32:24.945
Okay, well, look, that is horrible.

32:25.028 --> 32:27.281
You should've immediately gone to HR,
and I'm sure--

32:27.364 --> 32:29.658
For the longest time,
there was literally no HR.

32:29.741 --> 32:32.452
Yes, and now there is
an entire department, all right?

32:32.536 --> 32:35.038
That is what I mean
about focusing on the negative.

32:35.122 --> 32:37.082
WeWork is a young company,

32:37.165 --> 32:42.129
and we are always growing and evolving
and striving to do better.

32:42.212 --> 32:44.506
But you don't seem to want to see that.

32:44.590 --> 32:45.591
Okay, look, look.

32:45.674 --> 32:46.800
I heard someone say

32:46.884 --> 32:50.345
that they can't meet anyone because
they're stuck at work all the time.

32:50.429 --> 32:54.433
Well, you are surrounded
by all of these amazing people,

32:54.516 --> 32:57.102
so meet someone at work.

32:57.186 --> 32:59.521
We've had two WeWork engagements!

32:59.605 --> 33:02.774
Yeah, okay,
we've all met a bunch of people.

33:02.858 --> 33:05.277
Me personally,
I've "met" four people at work.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.196
Everyone's fucking everyone.

33:07.279 --> 33:08.572
Thank you all so much--

33:08.655 --> 33:11.074
You know, I found a used condom
under my desk.

33:11.158 --> 33:12.951
Rebekah, there's a closet

33:13.035 --> 33:15.829
called the "the fuck closet."
Wanna guess what happens in there?

33:15.913 --> 33:19.541
Okay, I think we can all agree
that there should not be a fuck closet.

33:20.834 --> 33:23.712
All right, and I think you should tell
your boss. And I will tell--

33:23.795 --> 33:25.088
Who do you think we're fucking?

33:27.382 --> 33:29.968
You keep saying we're a family
and that this is our company,

33:30.052 --> 33:31.512
but none of that is true.

33:32.095 --> 33:33.722
So please just stop saying it.

33:33.805 --> 33:35.057
- Yeah!
- Yes!

33:35.891 --> 33:37.267
- Yeah.
- Stop.

33:41.897 --> 33:43.732
Thank you all so much!

33:43.815 --> 33:45.651
Who else gets a helicopter?

33:50.697 --> 33:52.449
How could you let that happen to me?

33:53.617 --> 33:56.453
- How could you let that happen?
- I didn't let anything happen.

33:56.537 --> 33:58.997
We just have to contain this.
What are we gonna do?

33:59.081 --> 34:01.458
How would we contain it?
We can't shut down Twitter.

34:01.542 --> 34:03.335
- Are you kidding me?
- No, it's--

34:03.418 --> 34:04.503
So bad!

34:04.586 --> 34:06.797
And I say one thing wrong,
and then, all of a sudden,

34:06.880 --> 34:09.007
I'm being blamed
for a fucking fuck closet!

34:11.592 --> 34:14.137
Great. Fuck closet. That won't go viral.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.225
Where's the fuck closet?

34:25.524 --> 34:28.235
- Vanessa's drafting a statement for you--
- I don't need a statement.

34:28.318 --> 34:30.195
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
- I don't. I--

34:30.279 --> 34:32.531
Yes, you do. You do.

34:33.031 --> 34:34.491
And we've hired outside counsel.

34:36.869 --> 34:40.246
Rivka, it's okay. It's okay.
It's just words.

34:48.589 --> 34:50.047
Can you just come say hello?

34:59.892 --> 35:01.101
Hi, honey!

35:02.728 --> 35:03.729
Hi, Daddy.

35:07.691 --> 35:09.109
Bought it at an auction.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.862
Wasn't exactly Sotheby's.

35:12.905 --> 35:14.573
Haven't had it appraised.

35:15.866 --> 35:17.284
And?

35:19.953 --> 35:20.954
To your nose.

35:21.038 --> 35:22.039
To your cheeks.

35:31.173 --> 35:32.674
It seems like the real deal.

35:33.342 --> 35:34.801
Then we're gonna finish it.

35:35.636 --> 35:36.637
My last supper.

35:39.765 --> 35:41.934
How long have you been dealing with this?

35:44.436 --> 35:45.437
Two years.

35:47.689 --> 35:48.690
Okay.

35:51.818 --> 35:53.570
I didn't want to worry you.

35:53.654 --> 35:56.406
The lawyers insisted the whole time
that it was gonna be dropped.

35:57.533 --> 35:58.784
"The lawyers."

36:05.165 --> 36:07.167
Do you know where you're going
or for how long?

36:08.043 --> 36:11.255
There's one place called Allenwood.

36:12.130 --> 36:14.758
Six months, maybe a year.

36:15.300 --> 36:18.387
All comes down to the judge.
That's why I need your letter.

36:18.470 --> 36:20.722
I need him to know
who I really, really am.

36:20.806 --> 36:24.101
I promise I'm gonna do it tonight.
I'm gonna write it tonight.

36:24.184 --> 36:25.185
Okay.

36:28.856 --> 36:30.482
Let's talk about something nice.

36:32.234 --> 36:33.485
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:34.111 --> 36:35.445
How is Harlow?

36:36.446 --> 36:37.823
She is all joy.

36:37.906 --> 36:39.700
I mean, she's such a daddy's girl.

36:39.783 --> 36:41.159
Loves Adam.

36:41.994 --> 36:44.705
Well, everybody does.

36:44.788 --> 36:46.039
It's like his superpower.

36:49.293 --> 36:52.254
That wine would go perfectly
with a New York strip

36:52.337 --> 36:54.381
and shrimp cocktail from Peter Luger's.

36:54.464 --> 36:57.217
That's where I want you to take me
for my last supper.

36:59.845 --> 37:01.638
I haven't eaten red meat since Keith.

37:04.683 --> 37:07.060
Great sides. Great sides.

37:07.644 --> 37:10.647
You used to love their creamed spinach.

37:15.736 --> 37:20.199
Probably shouldn't get a DUI
a week before sentencing.

37:20.282 --> 37:22.159
Mind if I take the guest room for tonight?

37:23.452 --> 37:24.870
Sure. Of course.

37:24.953 --> 37:28.207
That way I can help you with the letter,
if you need it.

37:28.290 --> 37:29.875
- Daddy…
- And it's really--

37:29.958 --> 37:33.504
I know what to do. It's okay.
He needs to know who you really are.

37:33.587 --> 37:37.716
He just needs to know who you really are.
I just need to write what you mean to me.

37:42.387 --> 37:44.014
That's your superpower.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.934
- I don't have a superpower.
- You sure do.

37:47.601 --> 37:51.522
You always, always know
exactly what people need to hear.

37:58.695 --> 38:00.072
I gotta go make some calls.

38:28.225 --> 38:31.019
As you know, this is not the first time

38:31.103 --> 38:32.980
my father has made a mistake.

38:35.232 --> 38:36.984
My father had started a charity.

38:37.067 --> 38:39.111
American Cancer Research Fund?

38:39.194 --> 38:41.071
I lost my mother to breast cancer.

38:41.154 --> 38:42.489
I'm so sorry.

38:42.573 --> 38:43.949
Your dad is a saint.

38:54.877 --> 38:58.755
The unsuspecting victims,
defrauded of over a million dollars

38:58.839 --> 39:01.800
by your company,
the American Cancer Research Fund.

39:03.302 --> 39:07.264
Mr. Paltrow,
you are not being prosecuted personally.

39:07.347 --> 39:10.184
But ACRF is pleading guilty to fraud.

39:10.934 --> 39:14.104
And in the eyes of this court,
you bear responsibility

39:14.188 --> 39:15.772
for the actions of your company.

39:17.024 --> 39:19.860
You ran a company that engaged in fraud.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.778
So, what does that make you?

39:26.450 --> 39:27.576
I don't know, sir.

39:28.785 --> 39:30.746
It makes you a fraud.

39:33.123 --> 39:34.416
Yes, Your Honor.

39:35.375 --> 39:36.502
Say it.

39:40.964 --> 39:42.216
I'm a fraud.

39:45.719 --> 39:46.887
Case dismissed.

39:48.931 --> 39:51.308
Tragically, a few years later,

39:52.100 --> 39:54.603
my brother was diagnosed with cancer

39:54.686 --> 39:56.355
and died.

39:58.315 --> 39:59.858
Let's go get some steaks.

40:01.318 --> 40:03.862
Keith's death broke my father.

40:05.781 --> 40:06.990
He's a good man.

40:07.074 --> 40:09.368
He's just numb sometimes
to his own actions

40:09.451 --> 40:12.120
because he's in so much pain.

40:13.163 --> 40:16.375
He laughs less. He worries more.

40:16.458 --> 40:19.920
He can't enjoy the small moments
that make a life.

40:21.171 --> 40:23.841
I stopped eating meat
the day my brother died.

40:25.384 --> 40:27.386
My father stopped living.

40:29.137 --> 40:31.390
He's not the man you think he is.

40:31.473 --> 40:35.894
He's the man that taught me
that family comes first.

40:35.978 --> 40:38.021
Taught me to fight for what I believe in.

40:38.105 --> 40:42.359
And that is what I am doing right now.
Fighting to keep my family together.

40:45.362 --> 40:49.032
Sincerely, Rebekah Paltrow Neumann.

41:43.629 --> 41:45.130
So pretty.

42:00.854 --> 42:02.105
What the f--

42:03.607 --> 42:05.275
- I am so sorry.
- Hey, Rebekah.

42:05.359 --> 42:07.653
I'm s-- I'm-- I'm so sorry.

42:07.736 --> 42:09.488
I'm so sorry. Where is Adam?

42:11.990 --> 42:15.160
Oh, he's not he-- I don't think he's here.

42:16.537 --> 42:18.372
I'm so-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:34.888 --> 42:36.014
It's okay.

42:38.225 --> 42:39.560
Hey, it's okay.

43:06.461 --> 43:08.172
You're not gonna run the article.

43:09.756 --> 43:12.718
- But it's such a good one.
- Is it?

43:12.801 --> 43:16.388
I don't know, it feels like
you're picking on a young company

43:16.471 --> 43:20.309
that only wants to do good
and is going to do better. I just--

43:20.392 --> 43:22.978
Well, I mean,
the article will cover all of that.

43:25.147 --> 43:28.108
I just--
I wonder if there was another way.

43:35.115 --> 43:36.575
You have something to offer?

43:37.951 --> 43:40.621
I hear Gwyneth and Chris
have an open marriage.

43:40.704 --> 43:42.706
That might make an interesting story.

43:47.586 --> 43:50.047
The statement
that we've put together is just--

43:50.130 --> 43:52.925
If you follow it exactly,
we can just move forward from this.

43:53.008 --> 43:54.551
And we really appreciate your help.

43:54.635 --> 43:55.636
- And like--
- How did it go?

43:59.556 --> 44:01.350
She handled it.

44:02.559 --> 44:05.354
Because you couldn't.

44:06.855 --> 44:09.608
Come on, man. That's not fair.

44:11.652 --> 44:12.653
Let's talk.

44:13.612 --> 44:15.322
Who here is having a great time?

44:17.241 --> 44:20.869
All right, so am I.
So am I. I'm having a great time.

44:21.703 --> 44:25.082
- How many people here are drunk right now?
- Yes. Miguel!

44:27.501 --> 44:29.920
Right. Okay. So am I.

44:31.797 --> 44:33.549
Remember, they said not to deviate.

44:34.132 --> 44:35.133
Thanks.

44:37.177 --> 44:40.097
Our lawyers went over every word
with outside counsel.

44:41.723 --> 44:44.184
They just want to hear you apologize.

44:45.727 --> 44:46.937
I know what to say.

44:49.898 --> 44:51.233
Yeah, yeah…

44:53.443 --> 44:57.698
Please welcome to the stage Adam Neumann!

45:02.536 --> 45:03.871
Thank you!

45:05.747 --> 45:09.042
Thank you to everyone
who helped make this weekend possible!

45:09.126 --> 45:10.460
Yes!

45:10.544 --> 45:13.422
To the bartenders
who kept the drinks flowing!

45:14.923 --> 45:19.845
To the taco guys who made chimichangas
till 5:00 in the morning!

45:19.928 --> 45:21.805
Thank you!

45:21.889 --> 45:23.682
My ass is still burning, by the way.

45:29.438 --> 45:33.358
This is community,
this feeling that we all have.

45:34.026 --> 45:37.946
This feeling, that… happiness.

45:38.614 --> 45:40.240
That feeling is WeWork.

45:42.201 --> 45:45.329
So let's take that feeling,
and let's take that energy.

45:45.412 --> 45:47.831
Let's take it all back into our jobs

45:47.915 --> 45:52.878
and keep kicking ass!

45:56.798 --> 45:59.968
Now, before we go,

46:00.636 --> 46:03.680
Rebekah has something
she would love to say to you all.

46:04.473 --> 46:06.225
Rebekah. Make some noise.

46:08.769 --> 46:09.770
Thank you.

46:21.532 --> 46:24.117
There's been a lot of talk
about roles this weekend.

46:27.120 --> 46:31.458
The roles we play for each other,

46:32.125 --> 46:35.045
the roles we play for ourselves.

46:39.883 --> 46:43.804
I said that women had to support men,
and I meant it.

46:44.429 --> 46:46.598
It's the truth.

46:47.474 --> 46:50.894
But it's not the whole truth.

46:51.812 --> 46:55.774
This is your base and bonus range,
but the real value is in the shares.

46:55.858 --> 46:59.528
You get 2,000 after year one.
You get 2,500 after year two.

46:59.611 --> 47:04.449
The whole truth is that
we need to support each other.

47:04.533 --> 47:05.534
Yes!

47:05.617 --> 47:07.411
Now, that can be a man.

47:08.453 --> 47:12.165
It could be a woman. It can be a friend.
It doesn't matter.

47:12.249 --> 47:15.586
What matters is that we empower others.

47:16.211 --> 47:18.839
Just need you to sign this NDA.

47:23.260 --> 47:24.303
Welcome to WeWork.

47:26.597 --> 47:31.143
That's why Adam and Miguel started WeWork:
to empower all of you.

47:31.727 --> 47:35.522
To empower our members
to innovate, to create.

47:35.606 --> 47:38.692
To empower our employees
to build community

47:38.775 --> 47:42.738
and be a part
of something larger than themselves.

47:48.160 --> 47:52.331
So if our role,

47:52.998 --> 47:55.375
our responsibility,

47:55.918 --> 47:57.544
is to empower each other,

47:58.212 --> 48:02.674
then… what's the role of the company?

48:02.758 --> 48:07.137
What's WeWork's role in the world?

48:09.389 --> 48:15.687
WeWork's role is nothing less than
to elevate the world's consciousness.

48:18.273 --> 48:23.445
And by doing that,
we will make a better world together!

48:23.529 --> 48:26.782
All of us! Together!

48:26.865 --> 48:28.450
- We!
- Work!

48:28.534 --> 48:29.743
- We!
- Work!

48:29.826 --> 48:30.911
- We!
- Work!

48:30.994 --> 48:31.995
- We!
- Work!

48:32.079 --> 48:33.080
- We!
- Work!

48:33.163 --> 48:34.164
- We!
- Work!

48:34.248 --> 48:35.207
- We!
- Work!

48:35.290 --> 48:36.708
- We!
- Work!

48:36.792 --> 48:38.377
Beautiful.

48:49.346 --> 48:50.889
Okay.

48:50.973 --> 48:52.474
Thank you.

48:52.558 --> 48:55.769
Goodbye. We'll see you soon. See you soon!
