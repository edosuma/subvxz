00:00.093 --> 00:02.257
Previously on <i>Dominion...</i>

00:02.292 --> 00:04.189
You can bring back
a souvenir,

00:04.225 --> 00:06.442
the head of Claire Riesen.

00:08.479 --> 00:10.182
The only thing that
spared your life

00:10.217 --> 00:11.363
is your service
to this city.

00:11.399 --> 00:12.531
You think you're gonna
get away with this?

00:12.566 --> 00:13.899
You won't get away with this.

00:13.951 --> 00:15.784
Gates, I need you to
find someone for me.

00:15.820 --> 00:16.401
Zoe Holloway.

00:16.436 --> 00:18.358
She's a V-1, wants to
overthrow my government.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.322
Give me an hour,
and I'll see what I can do.

00:22.126 --> 00:23.926
A few days ago an angel stole
a key from me,

00:23.961 --> 00:26.128
and I'd like you
to bring it to me.

00:26.163 --> 00:29.715
That is General Edward Riesen
of Vega,

00:29.750 --> 00:34.670
part of the pact between our two
cities, which you now owe me.

00:34.672 --> 00:36.866
I banish your spirit
to the outer sphere.

00:36.901 --> 00:38.200
Aah!

00:51.856 --> 00:53.155
Oh!

00:53.190 --> 00:54.440
Aah!

00:55.993 --> 00:58.744
No, no.
No!

00:58.779 --> 01:00.496
No!

01:00.531 --> 01:01.780
Aah!

01:04.200 --> 01:05.801
Aah!

01:06.195 --> 01:09.082
_

01:11.509 --> 01:14.676
Ooh, that's pretty.

01:14.712 --> 01:16.128
Come to daddy.

01:20.050 --> 01:22.666
- How many?
- A cache of 20.

01:22.701 --> 01:25.604
100 credits,
find more.

01:25.639 --> 01:27.689
See, this is the key, Alex.

01:27.725 --> 01:29.558
This is the key
to winning this war.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.848
A few guns
won't stop Gabriel.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.445
No, no, no.

01:33.481 --> 01:35.864
Angels and humans
working together will.

01:35.900 --> 01:37.816
I mean, look at
the big picture, Alex.

01:37.868 --> 01:40.452
Huh?
After Gabriel, then what?

01:40.488 --> 01:41.931
I mean, there are millions
of angels on earth.

01:41.966 --> 01:43.356
You're never gonna
kill them all.

01:43.391 --> 01:46.625
You mean eight-balls living in
human bodies they stole.

01:46.660 --> 01:47.960
There'll be no future
for anyone

01:47.995 --> 01:49.545
if we don't stop Gabriel.

01:49.580 --> 01:51.296
And he will come for me.

01:51.332 --> 01:53.597
You promised me
an alliance,

01:53.632 --> 01:54.583
an army.

01:54.585 --> 01:56.418
But all I see
as I look around

01:56.470 --> 01:59.671
is a scared city
preparing for a siege.

01:59.723 --> 02:02.630
Well, Alex, you know,
I'm gonna protect my city first.

02:02.665 --> 02:03.734
What about Vega?

02:03.769 --> 02:06.428
You sent my message.
Did you hear anything back?

02:06.430 --> 02:07.357
Oh, it's gonna take
at least a week

02:07.392 --> 02:09.398
for our trucks
to cross the wasteland.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.266
When we walked
into this city,

02:11.268 --> 02:13.018
there were five trucks
out front.

02:13.070 --> 02:15.270
There are still five there.

02:15.272 --> 02:20.025
Mm, well, that's not
our only convoy, Alex.

02:20.077 --> 02:22.277
I did what you asked.

02:22.279 --> 02:24.029
I got your key.

02:24.081 --> 02:26.114
When are you gonna honor
your side of the bargain

02:26.116 --> 02:27.533
and give me the alliance?

02:27.585 --> 02:29.251
Hell, the army
that you promised?

02:29.286 --> 02:30.919
Now, we will help each other

02:30.955 --> 02:34.506
because that's our way
here in New Delphi.

02:34.542 --> 02:36.008
Okay?

02:36.043 --> 02:38.627
Excuse me.

02:41.848 --> 02:44.466
He's stalling.
He's hiding something.

02:44.468 --> 02:47.219
We need to know why.

02:47.271 --> 02:48.937
Help me!
Please!

02:50.399 --> 02:52.948
Dirty Davey,
you banged an eight-ball.

02:52.983 --> 02:55.193
We should've hanged you.

02:55.229 --> 02:57.026
You banged an eight-ball.

02:57.061 --> 03:00.899
We should have hanged you.

03:00.951 --> 03:03.235
- Aah!
- We should have hanged you.

03:06.290 --> 03:08.839
- Aah!
- Here he is. Come on!

03:13.382 --> 03:14.797
Go, come on!

03:14.832 --> 03:15.829
Oh!

03:15.864 --> 03:17.651
Nice and cozy down here,
isn't it?

03:17.686 --> 03:19.384
Of course you're here.

03:19.420 --> 03:21.670
Where else would I be?

03:21.672 --> 03:25.606
I mean, after all, Claire
and Arika took our tower,

03:25.641 --> 03:28.691
froze your assets,
hijacked your allies,

03:28.726 --> 03:30.812
ruined our family name.

03:30.848 --> 03:32.397
Oh, you did enough to that.

03:32.433 --> 03:34.716
Admit it, Dad,
they got you good.

03:34.751 --> 03:38.570
No. You don't have the blood
of a survivor, but I do.

03:38.606 --> 03:41.011
If the angels weren't
the death of me,

03:41.046 --> 03:43.318
then Claire Riesen
certainly won't be.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.443
Aah!

03:53.704 --> 03:55.666
Claire, I wasn't expecting
company today.

03:55.701 --> 03:58.340
Or ever, really.

03:58.375 --> 04:00.568
I've been standing out there
for five minutes.

04:00.603 --> 04:02.174
You could see me.

04:02.209 --> 04:05.631
Yeah, hoping you'd go away.

04:05.683 --> 04:08.156
2004 ALCS.

04:08.191 --> 04:11.053
Red Sox, Yankees.

04:11.055 --> 04:12.437
Down three games to zip.

04:12.473 --> 04:16.355
At this point,
we had a 4.9% chance

04:16.390 --> 04:18.678
to come back and win it all,
which is impossible.

04:18.713 --> 04:21.272
Until a homer
turned it all around,

04:21.307 --> 04:23.982
thanks to this guy,

04:24.034 --> 04:25.117
"Big Papi."

04:25.152 --> 04:27.221
She got this for me.
I was there.

04:27.256 --> 04:29.432
My ma took me and we were
up in the nosebleeds

04:29.467 --> 04:31.476
above Pesky's pole,
and at the end of the game,

04:31.511 --> 04:35.127
she elbowed her way down to
the field to get this signed.

04:35.162 --> 04:37.379
I mean, there was
no stopping that woman.

04:37.414 --> 04:40.882
It's one of the last things
Ma gave me.

04:40.918 --> 04:42.384
What does it matter
now anyway?

04:42.419 --> 04:44.419
They're all dead.

04:47.841 --> 04:50.258
You know, I watch this game
when I can't fix a problem,

04:50.260 --> 04:51.893
and Zoe is a problem
that I can't solve.

04:51.929 --> 04:53.895
I don't know
what is in that crate.

04:53.931 --> 04:55.931
I've checked the armories.
Nothing's missing.

04:55.933 --> 04:57.899
Okay, I need
a list from you.

04:57.935 --> 04:59.651
All the condemned
structures in this city,

04:59.687 --> 05:00.986
I want soldiers
to search them.

05:01.021 --> 05:02.521
Rebels have got
to be somewhere.

05:02.573 --> 05:05.342
Okay, well, sure.
I'll get right on it.

05:05.377 --> 05:06.942
Things were bad enough
with the angels,

05:06.944 --> 05:08.827
and now we have an enemy
in our own walls.

05:08.862 --> 05:10.829
I'll deal with the rebels.
If you want to help, great.

05:10.864 --> 05:14.866
And if you don't, well,
enjoy the rest of the game.

05:17.421 --> 05:18.954
Did you bring someone
with you?

05:18.956 --> 05:21.623
No! I followed the protocol
you established with my dad.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.542
I just snuck right out.
That is what you wanted.

05:23.594 --> 05:24.676
Nobody knows I'm here.

05:24.712 --> 05:26.628
Okay, then who is that?

05:26.630 --> 05:29.325
Shit.
It must be one of Zoe's people.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.265
He's followed me here.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.301
Oh, that's really cute.
Hold up. I got this.

05:56.627 --> 05:59.795
Enjoying yourself,
Janeck, hmm?

05:59.830 --> 06:02.552
A little music,
little bourbon.

06:02.587 --> 06:03.999
Whiskey.

06:04.001 --> 06:06.885
I was waiting at the gates
of New Delphi

06:06.920 --> 06:09.329
for an army
that never arrived,

06:09.364 --> 06:12.557
an army my herald
was ordered to call.

06:12.593 --> 06:14.810
Tell me, Janeck,

06:14.845 --> 06:17.062
why was that?

06:17.097 --> 06:18.647
'Cause I never summoned them.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.505
You failed with a human.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.100
You couldn't unlock
his markings.

06:22.152 --> 06:24.853
The aerie was bombed,
good soldiers died.

06:24.855 --> 06:26.496
And for what?

06:26.531 --> 06:31.359
Father hasn't come back,
maybe he never will.

06:31.361 --> 06:33.862
Ragh!

06:33.864 --> 06:37.415
He will, and I'll be the one
to bring him home.

06:37.451 --> 06:40.585
But if you doubt me, Janeck,

06:40.621 --> 06:42.587
you won't get to see it.

06:42.623 --> 06:44.506
Like Uriel?

06:44.541 --> 06:46.842
We found her body, Gabriel.

06:46.877 --> 06:49.845
She was killed
in the bombing.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.320
Bourbon is whiskey.

07:28.418 --> 07:32.420
I am still alive.

07:35.058 --> 07:38.009
I'll gather the army.

07:53.294 --> 07:58.294

www.addic7ed.com

08:00.417 --> 08:03.368
Dad, you don't want to sleep
through your own death.

08:03.420 --> 08:07.923
Trust me, that last burst
of adrenaline is killer.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.300
Aren't you excited?

08:20.288 --> 08:21.887
Excited about what?

08:21.939 --> 08:23.463
To die.

08:23.498 --> 08:26.441
You finally get to be
face-to-face with your maker.

08:26.476 --> 08:28.057
Oh, wait, that's right,

08:28.092 --> 08:30.645
you lost your faith.

08:32.173 --> 08:35.871
It's ironic that when
angels descend from heaven

08:35.907 --> 08:38.236
with concrete proof
of God's existence,

08:38.288 --> 08:40.871
you lose your faith.

08:40.908 --> 08:44.546
I won't believe in a God whose
angels slaughtered my family.

08:44.581 --> 08:46.799
You helped
in that slaughter.

08:46.834 --> 08:50.248
I must say, I can't wait
to see how it all ends.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.417
I don't think
I'll have to wait long.

08:52.469 --> 08:54.886
These people won't kill me.

08:57.870 --> 09:01.259
That's all you have left
to offer, Dad.

09:01.311 --> 09:03.478
Just your life.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.849
- Come on, get up.
- Wait.

09:12.322 --> 09:13.989
Let's shoot him
in the head

09:14.024 --> 09:15.824
and throw his body
in the streets.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.006
No. No, I'm not gonna waste
this opportunity.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.277
Zoe, right?

09:19.329 --> 09:21.558
You're Zoe.
I know all about you.

09:21.593 --> 09:22.747
We can make a deal,
come on.

09:22.783 --> 09:24.833
We could... we could
come to an agreement.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.362
We don't have time
for this.

09:26.397 --> 09:29.170
We need to keep moving.
They found our safe house, Zoe.

09:29.206 --> 09:30.922
We need a new place to hide.

09:30.958 --> 09:33.541
This will just take
a few minutes.

09:33.543 --> 09:36.845
The death of David Whele
needs to be recorded.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.681
With that and this,

09:39.716 --> 09:42.343
the V-1s will be lining up
to join us.

09:42.378 --> 09:44.135
Please, I can help you.

09:46.523 --> 09:49.224
Don't think they're really
in the mood to talk.

09:50.978 --> 09:52.644
Dude's gotta have more
than five trucks

09:52.696 --> 09:53.694
in all of New Delphi, Alex.

09:53.729 --> 09:56.314
Maybe, but I know
he's lying.

09:56.366 --> 09:58.218
He never sent that message
to Vega.

09:58.253 --> 09:59.985
But Julian gave you that
New Delphi alliance thing.

10:00.037 --> 10:02.037
No, he gave us a promise.

10:02.072 --> 10:04.823
Well, a promise isn't
much help to my daughter,

10:04.875 --> 10:06.803
or your baby she's carrying.

10:06.838 --> 10:08.026
What?
You knocked up his daughter?

10:08.061 --> 10:09.090
Pete, sit down.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.913
Listen, listen, this is
our chance to end all of this,

10:11.915 --> 10:14.249
but we can't do it on our own.

10:14.251 --> 10:18.257
Julian promised us an army.
So where is it?

10:18.292 --> 10:20.055
Maybe he lied,
he doesn't have one.

10:20.090 --> 10:21.589
No.

10:21.591 --> 10:24.726
Oh, he may be lying
about the message to Vega,

10:24.761 --> 10:27.552
but he's telling the truth
about the power of New Delphi.

10:27.587 --> 10:31.649
Somehow this city has defied
Gabriel for 25 years.

10:31.685 --> 10:35.353
Something Vega couldn't do
and we had Michael on our side.

10:35.405 --> 10:40.075
He has something formidable
enough to keep them safe.

10:40.110 --> 10:42.410
Then I'm gonna find it.

10:42.446 --> 10:45.523
General, I need you to buy me
some time with Julian.

10:45.558 --> 10:47.115
Noma, you're coming with me.

10:47.117 --> 10:48.533
You're not gonna leave me here,
are you?

10:48.585 --> 10:50.835
You don't leave this room.

10:50.871 --> 10:52.370
We're lucky we made it
this far.

10:52.422 --> 10:54.994
But if anyone figures out
you were possessed,

10:55.029 --> 10:56.174
they're gonna ask how.

10:56.209 --> 10:58.510
No one here can know
what I can do.

10:58.545 --> 10:59.711
You got it?

10:59.763 --> 11:01.763
Yeah.

11:04.768 --> 11:06.518
It doesn't seem like
Zoe's style

11:06.553 --> 11:09.471
to send someone
to do her dirty work.

11:13.443 --> 11:15.527
Here comes the cavalry.

11:18.482 --> 11:20.448
Holy shit.

11:20.484 --> 11:21.983
He's an angel.

11:32.329 --> 11:34.663
Gabriel must still be alive.

11:34.698 --> 11:36.798
He is the only one
who would send an angel.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.416
Why?
Why here?

11:38.468 --> 11:42.470
To kill me.

11:46.309 --> 11:48.022
Vega security, go ahead.

11:48.057 --> 11:49.909
This is an emergency.

11:49.944 --> 11:54.015
We need you to send more so...

12:38.623 --> 12:40.444
Hello, brother.

12:41.651 --> 12:43.740
Why are you here?

12:43.742 --> 12:46.292
Noma called to me.

12:46.328 --> 12:48.077
Where's Alex?

12:48.079 --> 12:51.297
Your friends in Vega
bombed my aerie.

12:51.333 --> 12:54.584
Noma escaped,
but Alex died there.

12:54.586 --> 12:57.420
Uriel was there, too.

12:57.422 --> 13:00.507
Our little sister,

13:00.559 --> 13:04.427
she's dead.

13:04.429 --> 13:08.681
Uriel.

13:08.733 --> 13:10.733
Don't.

13:14.773 --> 13:16.560
You're lying about Uriel.

13:16.595 --> 13:17.524
I'm not.

13:17.576 --> 13:18.858
And you're lying
about Alex.

13:18.910 --> 13:19.875
He's alive!

13:19.910 --> 13:21.861
Lying?

13:21.913 --> 13:23.830
You think a human could
survive something

13:23.865 --> 13:26.866
that killed one of our own?

13:37.796 --> 13:39.448
Are you really going
to do this?

13:51.977 --> 13:55.111
Feeling better?

14:00.235 --> 14:01.188
He can't cut this power.

14:01.223 --> 14:05.989
The generator's lines
run inside.

14:09.828 --> 14:11.494
Is that safe?

14:11.496 --> 14:15.298
No, but in a world
filled with abominations,

14:15.333 --> 14:19.302
death by immolation
seems almost a comfort.

14:19.337 --> 14:21.721
He didn't cut the feed.

14:21.756 --> 14:23.173
He wants us to watch.

14:23.208 --> 14:25.308
Is there any other way
to reach outside?

14:25.343 --> 14:26.809
No.

14:26.845 --> 14:28.953
So tell me, Gates,

14:28.988 --> 14:30.912
is this place gonna hold
against an angel?

14:30.947 --> 14:33.650
That's nine inches of reinforced
concrete and steel.

14:33.685 --> 14:35.852
Even a higher angel
can't get through that.

14:39.241 --> 14:42.025
You sure about that?

14:42.077 --> 14:44.360
You mutilated V-1s,

14:44.362 --> 14:46.171
amputated their hands for
stealing food,

14:46.206 --> 14:49.592
You're a deviant who kept
an eight-ball as a sex toy.

14:49.627 --> 14:52.368
You killed our children.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.069
They know you well, Dad.

14:54.104 --> 14:55.618
Murdered one with
your bare hands.

14:55.653 --> 14:58.258
What was that
little girl's name?

14:59.878 --> 15:01.987
Bixby.

15:02.022 --> 15:05.214
All right, Jasper, I know it
feels good, but we got enough.

15:05.216 --> 15:06.382
Thank God.

15:06.434 --> 15:08.268
Seems a little late
for that.

15:08.303 --> 15:10.562
They'll sweep this area soon.
We gotta go.

15:10.597 --> 15:11.658
Shoot him.

15:11.693 --> 15:14.219
No.
Please... please, God, no.

15:14.254 --> 15:16.226
Better, but dig deeper, Dad.

15:16.261 --> 15:17.906
Can you find a spark
of that faith

15:17.941 --> 15:20.113
that once burned in your heart?

15:20.148 --> 15:22.949
Wait!
I can help you!

15:22.984 --> 15:25.038
How... how long do you think
you're gonna last

15:25.073 --> 15:26.286
in a walled city?

15:26.321 --> 15:27.481
Longer than you.

15:27.516 --> 15:31.040
No, I can show you
a place to hide.

15:31.076 --> 15:33.242
You can't stage a revolution

15:33.244 --> 15:35.244
running from tunnel
to warehouse.

15:35.297 --> 15:39.082
It's only a matter of time.

15:39.134 --> 15:40.249
Hold up, Jasper.

15:43.505 --> 15:46.556
You have ten seconds, Whele.

15:46.591 --> 15:50.259
I used to be a preacher

15:50.261 --> 15:54.097
in a public access station
in old Las Vegas.

15:54.099 --> 15:56.441
It's safe,

15:56.476 --> 16:00.236
and there's a generator.

16:00.271 --> 16:02.488
Zoe, he's just spinning.

16:02.524 --> 16:06.159
Of course he is.

16:06.194 --> 16:10.246
But we can kill him now
or in 30 minutes.

16:10.281 --> 16:14.450
Either way,
he's still dead.

16:14.452 --> 16:17.120
Take us there.

16:17.172 --> 16:19.756
Under the sheetrock, this place
is lined floor to ceiling

16:19.791 --> 16:22.180
with steel that was scavenged
from old casino vaults.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.554
He's searching for a seam,
looking for a flaw.

16:24.589 --> 16:25.878
Are there any?

16:25.930 --> 16:27.296
Of course there are.
Everything has a weakness.

16:27.298 --> 16:28.464
Well, that's not helpful,
is it?

16:28.516 --> 16:29.632
Well, it's reality.

16:29.634 --> 16:31.718
And this is reality
come to life.

16:31.770 --> 16:33.636
You know, you were born
inside these walls.

16:33.638 --> 16:35.805
You don't know war.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.475
That's the basement.

16:39.527 --> 16:42.812
He's headed down there.

16:42.814 --> 16:44.564
It's too dark for the cameras
and him.

16:44.616 --> 16:45.982
The dark's not gonna
slow him down anyway.

16:46.034 --> 16:47.230
Angel eyes are more sensitive
than ours.

16:47.265 --> 16:49.348
They are?

16:49.383 --> 16:54.193
Oh, so there's something the
genius doesn't know after all.

16:54.228 --> 16:58.995
I bet I have something
to fix those cameras.

17:00.131 --> 17:01.319
What the hell is that?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.666
He's trying to break through.

17:05.220 --> 17:06.636
Gates!

17:06.671 --> 17:08.337
Claire!

17:08.390 --> 17:10.973
Okay, listen, Gates,
when I move this,

17:11.009 --> 17:13.175
- pull your leg out, okay? Fast.
- Okay.

17:13.228 --> 17:14.594
Go! Go!

17:19.401 --> 17:21.184
Get up.

17:21.185 --> 17:23.526
Whoa, Gates!

17:23.560 --> 17:25.738
Shit.

17:29.414 --> 17:32.495
- Julian.
- Hey, General.

17:32.530 --> 17:34.588
Or is it Edward now?

17:34.623 --> 17:37.454
'Cause when you left your post,
you left your rank.

17:37.489 --> 17:38.918
I did.

17:38.953 --> 17:40.690
All these years as leaders
of the Cradle,

17:40.725 --> 17:43.089
and we've never had
the pleasure of meeting.

17:43.124 --> 17:45.758
Well, now you understand why.

17:45.794 --> 17:50.179
We don't share philosophies
on the possessed.

17:50.215 --> 17:54.050
How well do you know
Gabriel?

17:54.102 --> 17:57.099
Ooh, better than you,
I'd wager.

17:57.134 --> 17:59.255
I managed to keep him out
of Vega for 25 years,

17:59.290 --> 18:01.390
as have you.

18:01.392 --> 18:03.559
But now, thanks to Alex,
he's coming here.

18:03.611 --> 18:05.728
We have to prepare
for battle.

18:05.780 --> 18:08.898
I have defenses in place.

18:08.950 --> 18:12.618
You don't win wars with defense.

18:12.654 --> 18:14.403
No.
You do it with a trap.

18:14.405 --> 18:16.405
What trap?

18:18.576 --> 18:20.243
Let us help you.

18:20.295 --> 18:23.079
Gabriel's been at the top
of the food chain

18:23.131 --> 18:24.464
for thousands of years.

18:24.499 --> 18:26.048
Well, hundreds of thousands.

18:26.084 --> 18:28.751
Which is precisely his flaw.

18:28.753 --> 18:32.588
He sees us as mites
to be swatted.

18:32.590 --> 18:35.424
If we were to
kill an angel,

18:35.477 --> 18:39.428
we had better
think like one.

18:43.268 --> 18:46.068
Get General Riesen a drink.

18:46.104 --> 18:48.445
- Some of the good stuff.
- Yes, sir.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.440
Come on, let's talk.

18:51.493 --> 18:53.769
I saw Julian come down here
yesterday.

18:53.804 --> 18:58.114
He would want to keep anything
important as close as possible.

18:58.116 --> 19:00.449
Like that?

19:00.502 --> 19:02.952
Exactly.

19:08.209 --> 19:09.625
Move.

19:12.130 --> 19:13.713
Nice.

19:19.020 --> 19:21.020
Here.

19:22.857 --> 19:25.141
Need a little leverage.

19:25.143 --> 19:28.534
Wait, Alex.
Something feels wrong here.

19:28.569 --> 19:32.565
We need to find what
Julian is hiding.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.798
Very nice.

19:41.116 --> 19:42.691
Shit.

19:46.117 --> 19:48.117
Alex.

20:06.351 --> 20:08.401
This isn't a city
of merchants.

20:08.436 --> 20:10.702
It's a city of monsters.

20:14.136 --> 20:16.360
Alex is alive.

20:17.117 --> 20:18.770
And Uriel?

20:18.805 --> 20:20.919
She was at the aerie
when the bomb hit.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.954
You were with her when
the bomb hit and you're alive.

20:22.956 --> 20:25.790
- Maybe she...
- No, no, no.

20:25.825 --> 20:29.160
I was closer to the surface.
I heard the plane in time.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.179
I got out.

20:31.214 --> 20:33.014
She didn't.

20:33.049 --> 20:36.801
Michael, we found her body.

20:36.853 --> 20:40.021
We're losing our family.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.961
Am I still alive?

20:45.996 --> 20:47.312
Yes, just.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.697
- Oh.
- Welcome back.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.619
Okay.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.057
- Come on.
- Oh!

20:56.092 --> 20:57.789
You need to see this.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.747
Here.
Use this.

21:02.212 --> 21:03.828
Oh!

21:18.178 --> 21:22.180
He's cutting
through the door.

21:28.238 --> 21:30.353
Where's Pete, huh?

21:30.388 --> 21:32.857
I don't know.
He wasn't here when I got back.

21:32.909 --> 21:35.811
What the hell did you see?

21:35.846 --> 21:39.530
Yeah, what did you see, Alex?

21:39.532 --> 21:41.249
Your army.

21:41.284 --> 21:43.572
That's what that was,
wasn't it?

21:43.607 --> 21:45.586
All eight-balls, sleeping.

21:45.622 --> 21:47.102
Well, no, it's called stasis,
actually.

21:47.137 --> 21:49.674
They're preserving energy.
I hope you didn't disturb them.

21:49.709 --> 21:50.869
Why did you take Pete?

21:50.904 --> 21:52.020
Well, Pete was here,
you weren't.

21:52.055 --> 21:55.880
You were prying.
You broke my trust.

21:55.932 --> 21:58.549
Noma!
Noma, don't.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.218
Come on,
let's go see Pete.

22:02.889 --> 22:08.059
No, not the general.
I need his mind.

22:08.061 --> 22:11.229
Take a load off.

22:21.791 --> 22:24.208
Not bad, preacher man.

22:24.244 --> 22:26.411
Not bad.

22:26.463 --> 22:29.580
You've fallen so far, V-1s
don't think you're a threat.

22:31.918 --> 22:35.253
Broken-down old man.

22:35.255 --> 22:38.756
I see your plan.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.808
But is it part
of God's plan?

22:40.844 --> 22:43.728
God isn't here.

22:43.763 --> 22:48.266
Neither is your gun.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.272
What we have here is
an amped-up version

22:54.324 --> 22:56.607
of a prank we used at MIT,

22:56.659 --> 22:58.776
electrifying
our dorm doorknobs.

22:58.828 --> 23:00.451
Way amped up.

23:00.486 --> 23:02.877
This would kill a human
twice over

23:02.912 --> 23:04.263
who touches that steel door.

23:04.298 --> 23:09.120
You'll be okay, but just do not
step off that rubber mat.

23:12.831 --> 23:16.961
It's connected.

23:32.195 --> 23:33.478
Good.

23:34.531 --> 23:36.981
- Okay?
- Yeah.

23:44.073 --> 23:47.074
Claire, we did it.

23:51.831 --> 23:56.167
No.
We just pissed him off.

23:58.888 --> 24:00.972
Thanks for the tip
on this place.

24:01.007 --> 24:04.509
Love the decor, but it's
a little cramped, so...

24:04.511 --> 24:07.061
Wait.

24:07.096 --> 24:09.981
Did you really think
we weren't gonna kill you?

24:10.016 --> 24:11.159
Actually, no.

24:11.194 --> 24:13.518
He thought he was gonna find
a 35-year-old gun

24:13.520 --> 24:14.986
and shoot you both
in the face.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.687
Shut up!

24:16.689 --> 24:18.906
Who the hell
are you talking to?

24:18.942 --> 24:20.739
Wait, wait.
I can still help you.

24:20.774 --> 24:22.674
You are, David.
Your life was a waste,

24:22.709 --> 24:24.862
but your death will give
our people hope,

24:24.864 --> 24:26.262
strength.

24:26.297 --> 24:29.417
Strength?
Starving people can't fight.

24:29.452 --> 24:30.952
But I can get you food.

24:30.987 --> 24:35.006
I have the access codes to
the storage warehouses.

24:35.041 --> 24:38.176
You can slip in and out
unnoticed.

24:38.211 --> 24:39.897
And if they change my codes,

24:39.932 --> 24:41.424
I know all the other V-6s'.

24:41.459 --> 24:45.049
You can feed your people,
Zoe.

24:45.101 --> 24:48.018
Send someone to check it out.

24:48.053 --> 24:51.942
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

24:52.273 --> 24:55.226
You just bought yourself
another 30 minutes.

24:55.278 --> 24:59.280
The anticipation
is killing me.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.458
See, here's your Petey.

25:02.493 --> 25:05.526
Safe and sound.

25:05.561 --> 25:07.712
Early in our occupation
of this facility,

25:07.747 --> 25:10.791
we were attacked by Rhais,
a higher angel,

25:10.827 --> 25:12.293
one of Gabriel's lieutenants.

25:12.328 --> 25:13.911
And she would have
wiped us out

25:13.913 --> 25:17.748
but for a nest of what
you call eight-balls

25:17.800 --> 25:20.084
hiding in these tunnels.

25:20.086 --> 25:23.421
They saved us.

25:23.473 --> 25:26.424
And together we founded
New Delphi.

25:26.476 --> 25:29.066
And what I learned from
these angels

25:29.101 --> 25:31.596
was something that no one knew.

25:31.598 --> 25:36.142
That 25 years ago every lower
angel that was powerful enough

25:36.177 --> 25:38.603
to possess and inhabit
a human, did.

25:38.605 --> 25:41.113
But that still left millions
of lower angels

25:41.148 --> 25:42.942
lost in the darkness.

25:42.977 --> 25:46.994
And that's where they were
damned to remain,

25:47.030 --> 25:52.450
unless someone helped them
find a human home.

25:52.502 --> 25:54.162
Rhais was special.

25:54.197 --> 25:56.343
Catching her was
invaluable

25:56.378 --> 26:00.615
because she knew exactly
how to use this,

26:00.650 --> 26:04.247
the very thing that has made
New Delphi great

26:04.282 --> 26:09.850
and something that could still
make Vega great as well.

26:09.886 --> 26:11.519
Thanks to you, Alex.

26:11.554 --> 26:15.806
Not a sword, or a gun,

26:15.808 --> 26:20.027
but an amphora made of
empyrean steel

26:20.063 --> 26:23.698
was the first weapon
of New Delphi.

26:25.318 --> 26:27.318
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

26:31.935 --> 26:35.626
Now, we had a weak
and untrained people,

26:35.662 --> 26:38.503
but we needed an army.

26:38.538 --> 26:41.716
And Rhais taught us
how to create that army

26:41.751 --> 26:45.469
by pulling lower angels down
from the ether.

27:26.625 --> 27:30.715
Welcome, Menathas.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.054
Skin.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.879
Who's next?

27:49.348 --> 27:51.653
I'm not leaving you here to die
while I run to safety.

27:51.688 --> 27:53.126
Vega needs both of us,
so both of us

27:53.161 --> 27:54.775
are gonna figure out a way
to survive this.

27:54.811 --> 27:56.110
- Claire.
- No, not negotiable.

27:56.145 --> 27:59.864
You listen to me.

27:59.899 --> 28:03.284
You need to start using that
incredible brain of yours.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.447
Sorry, I don't know why
I did that.

28:15.482 --> 28:19.417
Maybe the possibility
of dying or something.

28:23.139 --> 28:27.391
I was holed up like this the day
that your dad found me

28:27.427 --> 28:29.268
in the library at MIT.

28:29.303 --> 28:31.556
I was hiding among
a stack of books,

28:31.591 --> 28:34.098
living off Coke
and Baby Ruths.

28:34.150 --> 28:35.733
And I was light years
from being qualified

28:35.768 --> 28:37.401
for the job that
he wanted me to do,

28:37.437 --> 28:40.104
but there was no one else.

28:40.156 --> 28:42.273
And you did it.

28:42.325 --> 28:46.744
Because of you,
Vega has food and energy.

28:46.779 --> 28:50.114
All because of me.

28:50.116 --> 28:52.917
Yeah, that simple thought
keeps me up at night.

28:59.625 --> 29:01.509
He's found the air intake.

29:01.544 --> 29:03.294
He's probably gonna set fire
to the building

29:03.296 --> 29:04.962
with us trapped inside,
smoke us out.

29:05.014 --> 29:06.797
That's what I'd do.

29:09.469 --> 29:13.471
Gates, you're a genius.

29:34.577 --> 29:36.627
Get off me!

29:36.662 --> 29:39.630
Aah! Get off me!

29:42.752 --> 29:46.003
Get off! Get off!

29:46.055 --> 29:49.390
Aah! Aah!

30:11.065 --> 30:11.830
What about Pete?

30:11.865 --> 30:13.942
It's too late, but if we
can get to the main gate...

30:13.977 --> 30:15.745
No, this city's
the best chance we have

30:15.780 --> 30:18.035
of taking Gabriel out.
We need Julian's help.

30:18.087 --> 30:19.665
How are we gonna
make him do that?

30:19.700 --> 30:21.088
I don't know, but I know
a place that's safe

30:21.124 --> 30:23.207
until we figure it out.

30:23.209 --> 30:27.511
And I'm not sure how
all this ends anymore.

30:27.547 --> 30:30.403
Not with the extinction
of the human race.

30:30.438 --> 30:32.767
Father's house was infested.

30:32.802 --> 30:35.331
When it's clean,
he'll come back.

30:35.366 --> 30:37.190
You're a fool, Gabriel.

30:37.225 --> 30:39.140
We are his children,
but so are they.

30:39.175 --> 30:41.392
Father made that very clear.

30:41.444 --> 30:42.791
The Chosen One is human.

30:42.826 --> 30:44.895
No.

30:44.897 --> 30:47.731
Father gave the markings
to you.

30:47.733 --> 30:49.233
You went against his will

30:49.285 --> 30:50.650
and gave them to Jeep.

30:50.685 --> 30:52.620
Then they went to Alex.

30:52.655 --> 30:54.151
You chose Alex.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.610
You made him the Chosen One.

30:55.645 --> 30:58.576
The markings were
meant for Alex.

30:58.578 --> 31:00.411
That was Father's will.

31:00.413 --> 31:02.934
You keep saying that,
Michael,

31:02.969 --> 31:06.250
but Father chose us
to leave his final message.

31:06.252 --> 31:10.254
Please, help me
bring him home.

31:13.676 --> 31:15.676
Where is Alex?

31:18.848 --> 31:21.398
I'll tell you,

31:21.434 --> 31:23.934
but you're not going to like
the answer.

31:23.936 --> 31:25.936
Go ahead.

31:25.938 --> 31:30.441
We're at the warehouse.

31:30.443 --> 31:34.161
We're in.
The code's good.

31:34.197 --> 31:36.119
Grab and dash, don't get greedy.

31:36.154 --> 31:38.666
- We can come back.
- Yeah, heard you clear.

31:38.701 --> 31:41.085
Drop the walkie.

31:41.120 --> 31:45.122
And... and the gun.

31:51.380 --> 31:53.964
You know, the TV show I did
from this studio

31:54.016 --> 31:56.269
was not very good,

31:56.304 --> 31:59.687
but some powerful moments that
shaped my life happened here.

32:03.976 --> 32:06.847
Every week I had an hour to
preach to an audience

32:06.882 --> 32:10.948
of maybe 50, all lonely
and late-night insomniacs.

32:10.983 --> 32:13.534
...I want you.

32:13.569 --> 32:16.370
Now, we know God
didn't give a damn

32:16.405 --> 32:18.024
about my TV audience.

32:18.059 --> 32:19.918
He didn't care about
who won the Super Bowl.

32:19.953 --> 32:22.508
He didn't care about any of us.

32:22.543 --> 32:25.366
But at that time,
I believed he sent that boy

32:25.401 --> 32:26.576
to teach me a lesson.

32:26.611 --> 32:29.199
Chad, you don't want to die.
Please, let's pray.

32:29.234 --> 32:31.135
He wanted me to think big.

32:31.170 --> 32:32.631
So I listened,

32:32.666 --> 32:35.142
and I posted that clip of...
of Chad on the Internet

32:35.177 --> 32:38.475
and my audience grew from 50
to millions overnight.

32:38.511 --> 32:39.592
Minus one.

32:39.627 --> 32:41.340
Chad hung himself when you
kicked him out of church.

32:41.375 --> 32:43.686
He was weak.

32:43.721 --> 32:46.629
A few months ago, I-I dropped
my son off in a desert

32:46.664 --> 32:48.019
with a gun and six bullets.

32:48.054 --> 32:50.945
I'm assuming he killed himself,
'cause like Chad, he was weak.

32:50.980 --> 32:53.857
Weak? I broke you.

32:53.859 --> 32:55.935
I made you believe in something
again.

32:55.970 --> 32:57.695
No, William,
you distracted me.

32:57.747 --> 33:00.403
You made me blind to what Claire
was doing behind my back.

33:00.438 --> 33:01.327
My love for you allowed it,

33:01.362 --> 33:04.044
but now I know
what I have to do.

33:04.079 --> 33:06.870
Wait.
Wait! No!

33:12.428 --> 33:15.658
I need to think big again.

33:19.646 --> 33:21.209
Where is he, Eddie?

33:21.447 --> 33:22.861
How would I know?

33:22.896 --> 33:24.332
You took me prisoner first.

33:24.367 --> 33:25.827
You knew she was an angel.

33:25.862 --> 33:28.959
Practically, everyone here is
an angel, aren't they?

33:28.995 --> 33:31.128
Noma was a soldier of mine.

33:31.164 --> 33:32.780
I wouldn't tell you
if I knew.

33:32.815 --> 33:36.333
What will they do?

33:38.862 --> 33:41.055
Well, knowing Alex,

33:41.090 --> 33:42.427
he'll make a run for it.

33:42.462 --> 33:43.796
He'll leave New Delphi.

33:43.831 --> 33:45.342
Double the men on the gates.

33:45.394 --> 33:47.394
Search everywhere!

34:00.943 --> 34:03.778
Nomes.

34:03.830 --> 34:06.997
I could hear that angel

34:07.033 --> 34:10.583
whispering to me

34:10.620 --> 34:13.420
while she tried
to slither inside

34:13.456 --> 34:16.257
and take my body.

34:16.292 --> 34:19.210
What she tried to do
was vile.

34:19.212 --> 34:23.214
I've never felt
so contaminated.

34:25.051 --> 34:27.051
They've taken Pete's body.

34:27.085 --> 34:28.215
Twice.

34:28.250 --> 34:30.567
Hey, we'll find him,

34:30.601 --> 34:32.723
and I'll evict the angel
from him.

34:32.725 --> 34:34.692
Or I can open this,

34:34.726 --> 34:36.777
make them pay.
Make Julian pay.

34:36.813 --> 34:41.565
Destroy him and his entire
city right now.

34:41.567 --> 34:45.735
What the hell is it?

34:45.788 --> 34:47.621
Death.

34:49.242 --> 34:51.242
Don't you see, Zoe?

34:51.293 --> 34:53.077
I'm that man with a gun.

34:53.129 --> 34:56.246
I'm your opportunity
right here, right now.

34:56.248 --> 34:58.415
I will help you.
I will show you the way,

34:58.467 --> 34:59.583
but you need to listen.

34:59.635 --> 35:02.219
Help me?
With more food codes?

35:02.255 --> 35:04.972
Codes for everything.

35:05.007 --> 35:07.470
I know all
this city's secrets.

35:07.505 --> 35:09.410
How many rebels
do you have, a hundred?

35:09.445 --> 35:11.478
With my help,
you will have thousands.

35:11.514 --> 35:13.249
Thousands of people
to follow you,

35:13.284 --> 35:14.899
believe in you.

35:14.934 --> 35:16.600
God isn't here, Zoe,

35:16.602 --> 35:21.238
so you need to lead them.

35:24.827 --> 35:26.443
Choice is yours.

35:26.445 --> 35:28.779
You want to go on
thinking small,

35:28.831 --> 35:31.916
kill me now.

35:31.951 --> 35:34.001
'Cause you two are dead.

35:34.036 --> 35:36.287
And I will be, too.

35:36.289 --> 35:39.932
And you, what do you get
out of this?

35:39.967 --> 35:41.508
A new beginning

35:41.544 --> 35:44.929
and a chance to help you
destroy Claire Riesen.

35:49.719 --> 35:52.636
It's one of
the archangel's weapons,

35:52.688 --> 35:56.640
given to them by our Father.

35:56.642 --> 36:00.644
This is the fifth Amphora,
darkness.

36:00.696 --> 36:02.980
"And the fifth angel
poured its vial

36:02.982 --> 36:05.032
"and his kingdom was
full of darkness,

36:05.067 --> 36:07.651
and they gnawed their tongues
for pain."

36:07.703 --> 36:12.156
And Julian uses it
to possess humans.

36:12.208 --> 36:15.125
It doesn't work that way.

36:15.161 --> 36:19.526
I think that the lower angels
are drawn to it

36:19.561 --> 36:22.166
because it's the last remnants
of God's power.

36:22.218 --> 36:24.251
They find it,

36:24.303 --> 36:28.005
and Julian guides them
into a human body.

36:30.843 --> 36:32.810
What would happen
if I opened it?

36:32.845 --> 36:34.845
You can't.

36:34.847 --> 36:38.899
Only an angel can unseal one of
the seven Amphorae.

36:38.935 --> 36:42.319
I still have no idea how Julian
uses one of these.

36:42.355 --> 36:44.855
So what would happen

36:44.857 --> 36:47.491
if we just unleashed
this whole thing right now?

36:47.526 --> 36:49.193
It'll destroy the city

36:49.245 --> 36:53.530
and everything around it
within 100 miles.

36:53.532 --> 36:56.033
He's smoking us out.
What now, Gates?

36:56.085 --> 36:57.517
Put it in the tube.

36:57.552 --> 36:58.752
Shit.

36:58.788 --> 37:00.506
Okay, we don't have
a lot of time.

37:01.707 --> 37:03.257
When he gets through
that door

37:03.292 --> 37:05.042
and he's all blinded
and confused,

37:05.044 --> 37:06.927
you get out first, okay?

37:06.963 --> 37:09.430
I'm gonna be right behind you
right after I press that button.

37:09.465 --> 37:11.181
- Okay?
- All right.

37:11.217 --> 37:12.800
Shit.

37:14.079 --> 37:16.854
Okay, ready?

37:26.732 --> 37:28.232
Where is he?

37:29.235 --> 37:31.452
He's there!

37:41.080 --> 37:44.778
Game time.
Close that door.

38:06.323 --> 38:07.582
Gates, are you okay?

38:07.617 --> 38:09.626
Oh, yeah, golden.

38:09.661 --> 38:10.800
We did it.

38:10.835 --> 38:12.371
Nothing could survive that.

38:12.406 --> 38:14.510
Okay, we need to get you
medical attention,

38:14.545 --> 38:15.598
and I need to alert
my soldiers.

38:15.633 --> 38:19.117
Hold on a second.
I just need a moment to process that

38:19.169 --> 38:22.987
my life's possessions have
just been consumed by flames.

38:23.023 --> 38:25.123
Not all of them.

38:31.181 --> 38:33.131
I don't know what to say.

38:33.183 --> 38:36.184
I bet that's rare.

38:39.105 --> 38:42.390
New Delphi is a dangerous place
for you to go alone, Michael.

38:42.442 --> 38:44.654
You're strong, but...

38:44.689 --> 38:48.023
Will you go with me?

38:48.058 --> 38:51.816
As my brother?

38:51.868 --> 38:55.320
We want him for
very different reasons.

38:55.372 --> 38:57.197
But we both want him safely
out of New Delphi.

38:57.232 --> 38:59.257
Then it's our methods
unlocking those tattoos

38:59.292 --> 39:00.949
that'll differ.

39:00.984 --> 39:04.796
If you harm him, Gabriel,
I will kill you.

39:04.831 --> 39:07.832
Will that also be
as my brother?

39:07.834 --> 39:10.571
My aerie wasn't my only
stronghold, Michael.

39:10.606 --> 39:13.115
I have angels all over
the world to help me.

39:13.150 --> 39:16.674
And a year to gather them.

39:19.179 --> 39:21.846
Fine, Michael.

39:21.898 --> 39:24.104
If it'll bring Father back,
I'll do anything,

39:24.139 --> 39:27.183
even help you and Alex.

39:27.218 --> 39:28.853
Fighting on the same side?

39:28.905 --> 39:30.521
Oh, be careful.

39:30.573 --> 39:32.490
You might like it.

39:32.525 --> 39:33.870
Your intel was wrong,
General.

39:33.905 --> 39:35.319
I don't think
they've left New Delphi.

39:35.354 --> 39:37.362
Have you misled me?

39:37.364 --> 39:39.530
'Cause everyone lies.

39:39.532 --> 39:40.999
But I did hope that
you and me...

39:41.034 --> 39:43.534
Julian.

39:43.586 --> 39:45.536
Oh, now, come on, Alex.

39:45.588 --> 39:47.205
If you know what that is,
then you know

39:47.257 --> 39:49.620
that you can't use that.

39:49.655 --> 39:50.958
No.

39:51.011 --> 39:52.568
But she can.

39:52.603 --> 39:54.276
Alex, what is that?

39:54.311 --> 39:56.629
- It's like a nuclear bomb.
- Oh, it's worse.

39:56.664 --> 39:58.633
How do you have
one of the Amphorae?

39:58.685 --> 40:00.468
Where did Rhais get it?

40:00.520 --> 40:02.720
Where did Rhais get it?!

40:05.392 --> 40:08.359
You move again,
and I'll open it!

40:11.309 --> 40:14.455
You're an eight-ball.

40:14.490 --> 40:17.869
No.
He's a dyad.

40:17.904 --> 40:20.429
Half human,
half higher angel

40:20.464 --> 40:23.845
fused together,
living in a single body.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.045
I never thought
they existed.

40:25.080 --> 40:28.183
Well, they do.
Just be careful with that, Noma.

40:28.218 --> 40:30.915
Why do you have it?

40:30.917 --> 40:33.501
You saw it with your own eyes.

40:33.553 --> 40:35.987
It allows me to bring down
my brothers and sisters

40:36.022 --> 40:38.590
from the ether.

40:38.625 --> 40:40.812
Fitting that it's
the plague of darkness

40:40.847 --> 40:44.083
that helps the lower angels
who've suffered in darkness

40:44.118 --> 40:50.234
in a penal system
created by the archangels.

40:50.270 --> 40:52.403
But if necessary,

40:52.439 --> 40:55.705
I can use it to kill Gabriel

40:55.740 --> 40:57.089
and Michael

40:57.124 --> 40:58.756
and their whole family.

40:58.791 --> 41:01.746
Good, then we agree.

41:01.781 --> 41:04.615
You promised me a way
to kill Gabriel.

41:04.667 --> 41:06.751
Well, now it's time
to fulfill that promise.

41:06.786 --> 41:10.455
Or Noma will unleash
the Amphora,

41:10.457 --> 41:11.589
not only on Gabriel,

41:11.624 --> 41:13.374
but this entire city.

41:13.426 --> 41:16.127
He dies, or we all die.

41:16.129 --> 41:19.130
The choice is yours.
