<i> - Things are really [bleep] up</i>
<i> between Chris and I right now.</i>

16:50.377 --> 16:51.976
<i> And I'm kind of, like,</i>
<i> what the [bleep] do I do?</i>

16:52.045 --> 16:54.178
Like, this is a really
big decision to make

16:54.247 --> 16:55.913
if I'm gonna stay
or leave my marriage.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.949
- This is the time
to figure out,

16:58.018 --> 17:01.219
is together you're gonna grow
and change, or is it separate?

17:01.287 --> 17:02.887
So I think you have to
have, like, a deadline.

17:02.956 --> 17:04.422
- November, it's three months.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.891
- Are we gonna make this
an anniversary for our divorce?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.259
Or are we gonna make this
an anniversary they we want to

17:08.328 --> 17:10.495
celebrate
and continue another year?

17:10.563 --> 17:13.064
- That date is slowly
creeping up on me.

17:13.133 --> 17:18.770
Actually, no, it's fast
creeping up on me.

17:18.838 --> 17:21.939
He has no idea,
so don't tell anybody.

17:22.008 --> 17:24.509
- He doesn't want a divorce?
- I don't know what he wants.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.444
Like, I don't--like he tells me
he wants to be with me,

17:26.513 --> 17:28.379
but then, like, he says
a lot of hurtful things.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.214
Like, [bleep]
divorce me already.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.549
- Oh, my God.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.518
- Then he goes into no guy's
gonna [bleep] deal

17:33.586 --> 17:34.752
with what I deal with.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.354

[bleep] your dog [bleep].

17:36.423 --> 17:38.189
He acts like I don't do
anything in our home.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.957
<i> - It's very sad to me</i>
<i> to see people</i>

17:40.026 --> 17:42.260
if they're just staying
in a loveless marriage.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.796
Because, like,
I see my marriage with Chris,

17:44.864 --> 17:48.132
and every day we have
new excitements and new things

17:48.201 --> 17:50.435
<i> we're, like, celebrating,</i>
<i> and we just, like,</i>

17:50.503 --> 17:52.136
<i> we have such love</i>
<i> for each other.</i>

17:52.205 --> 17:55.239
Seeing, like, a relationship
not have that,

17:55.308 --> 17:57.842
then maybe, you know,
it is time for them to move on

17:57.911 --> 17:59.477
and find their person.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.012
You never talk to us like this.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.580
- Yeah, no, it's been hard.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.549
[sighs]
You know. It's a lot.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.517

18:06.586 --> 18:08.853
like, two years,
like, all of us.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.055
But I'm glad we are
where we are.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.190

18:12.258 --> 18:13.458
- No. Cheers.
