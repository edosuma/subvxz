00:00.287 --> 00:02.043
Previously on "Queen of the South"

00:02.067 --> 00:04.067
Hello son. What's your name?

00:04.073 --> 00:05.877
- Tony.
- You Teresa's son?

00:05.901 --> 00:08.045
It's time for you guys to go, I think.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.929
I keep having these nightmares.
This guy shoots me.

00:12.953 --> 00:14.663
It feels so real.

00:14.687 --> 00:16.430
- Raul.
- Flaca.

00:16.454 --> 00:18.947
Raul is introducing us
to a connection from Atlanta.

00:18.971 --> 00:20.357
If we make a deal with her,

00:20.381 --> 00:22.367
she can clear a path to the East Coast.

00:22.391 --> 00:24.559
We cannot trust Boaz.

00:24.561 --> 00:26.527
Are you sure we can trust his cousin?

00:26.551 --> 00:27.956
Javier is different.

00:27.980 --> 00:29.541
You putting it to that
boss lady of your...

00:35.304 --> 00:37.274
This is really bad.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.443
I called off the deal with Dumas.

00:39.467 --> 00:41.328
I didn't expect him to want to go to war.

00:41.352 --> 00:43.380
I can't get through to Javier or Boaz.

00:43.404 --> 00:45.297
- Where's Bobby?
- I'm not telling you shit.

00:45.321 --> 00:46.716
Bobby runs a poker game on Thursdays.

00:46.740 --> 00:48.452
I'm looking for Bourbon Street.

00:48.476 --> 00:49.836
You're on the wrong side of town.

00:49.860 --> 00:51.116
Oh, great.

00:51.140 --> 00:52.513
I don't know shit about no kidnapping.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:08.781 --> 01:09.958
Where were you?

01:14.318 --> 01:16.098
I was with Boaz, Patrona.

01:17.104 --> 01:18.125
We went out.

01:18.149 --> 01:20.417
Why was the surveillance tape
at the bar missing?

01:20.441 --> 01:22.027
And the bathroom bleached?

01:26.072 --> 01:28.375
Tell me what happened at the bar.

01:36.527 --> 01:39.265
Easy BrieZee.

01:39.290 --> 01:40.770
That's what the boys call you, right?

01:40.794 --> 01:45.416
I don't condone that
but the... the irony's not lost.

01:47.251 --> 01:49.302
You didn't make it easy to find you.

01:49.304 --> 01:50.522
What do you want with me?

01:50.546 --> 01:51.848
Just the truth.

01:53.432 --> 01:55.327
Where's Bobby?

01:57.278 --> 01:59.255
I don't know where Bob...

02:02.442 --> 02:03.825
Go.

02:09.365 --> 02:11.340
Ah, oh!

02:13.494 --> 02:15.497
Ah, how Shakespearian.

02:15.521 --> 02:19.643
Two lovers and only one thing
in between them.

02:19.667 --> 02:22.071
- And that is Bobby.
- Yo, man, it wasn't like that.

02:22.073 --> 02:24.647
- Shut up, dumb-ass!
- It was these two guys.

02:24.671 --> 02:27.358
Oh, you think that
they'll kill you if you talk?

02:33.256 --> 02:36.774
I will kill you if you don't.

02:39.528 --> 02:41.573
You asked me to watch Boaz.

02:42.017 --> 02:43.675
He got drunk,

02:43.699 --> 02:45.925
got into a fight with a guy at the bar.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.262
Patrona, you know how he gets.

02:50.481 --> 02:53.018
- I cleaned it up.
- Did you kill him?

02:55.886 --> 02:57.495
No.

02:59.290 --> 03:01.203
We killed an innocent man because of you.

03:02.017 --> 03:04.638
There's no way to make that right.

03:04.662 --> 03:06.807
You put everything
we've built here at risk.

03:06.831 --> 03:08.374
Do you understand that?

03:08.845 --> 03:09.896
Look at me.

03:12.154 --> 03:14.898
Bury Bobby. Send Boaz back to Mexico.

03:16.223 --> 03:18.679
If you want to behave like him,

03:19.143 --> 03:20.726
get on the plane with him.

03:23.339 --> 03:24.958
Si, Patrona.

03:46.713 --> 03:48.562
Those two are a liability.

03:50.424 --> 03:52.711
Okay!

03:54.479 --> 03:56.756
Two guys came looking
for Bobby yesterday.

03:56.781 --> 03:58.214
But I'd never seen them before.

04:02.770 --> 04:05.223
What did they look like?

04:05.247 --> 04:06.925
Hispanic, maybe. It was fast.

04:06.949 --> 04:08.693
Please, please.

04:08.717 --> 04:09.836
There.

04:11.508 --> 04:12.600
Go.

04:12.624 --> 04:15.448
I just told 'em
that Bobby was playing poker.

04:15.958 --> 04:17.661
Did you hear from Bobby after that?

04:17.685 --> 04:18.785
- No, no!
- No!

04:18.786 --> 04:20.454
- No, no.
- No, I swear to God, no.

04:23.932 --> 04:25.185
No, no, no, no, no!

04:28.462 --> 04:31.030
You're a crier, poor girl.

04:31.032 --> 04:32.233
It ain't even really loaded.

04:34.093 --> 04:36.527
But see, that... that's
the whole thing, uh,

04:36.529 --> 04:38.565
about infidelity, right? You know?

04:38.589 --> 04:40.458
It's like somebody always gets hurt.

04:42.976 --> 04:44.594
Hey, y'all go on and get out of here.

04:45.429 --> 04:46.812
Yeah, you're good to go. Go.

04:46.814 --> 04:48.255
Get out. Get.

04:52.053 --> 04:54.681
Clean up your goddamn mess!

04:54.705 --> 04:56.256
Yo, get your ass up, man.

04:57.891 --> 05:00.827
You find out what happened
at that poker game.

05:01.737 --> 05:03.146
Go, man.

05:04.915 --> 05:06.036
Go on, now.

05:12.506 --> 05:14.768
Let's go.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.028
What'd you tell her?

05:17.052 --> 05:18.770
What she needed to hear.

05:26.510 --> 05:28.302
You want me to keep an eye on them?

05:29.564 --> 05:32.709
No, we have to meet
Raul's Atlanta connect.

05:34.369 --> 05:35.455
Oksana.

05:35.479 --> 05:37.741
We need her or we'll lose the client

05:37.765 --> 05:39.592
and the rest of the East Coast.

06:09.613 --> 06:12.192
We got surveillance footage
on the poker game.

06:17.571 --> 06:19.549
That's Mendoza's man.

06:19.573 --> 06:21.793
Get our boys over here.

06:21.817 --> 06:23.561
Tell them to come strapped.

06:27.434 --> 06:34.239
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:34.253 --> 06:37.337
Okay. Thank you for letting me know.

06:38.252 --> 06:40.455
- The judge went to your house.
- What?

06:40.457 --> 06:41.748
He could tell Dumas.

06:41.772 --> 06:43.019
We need to move Tony and Kelly Anne.

06:43.043 --> 06:44.227
Where?

06:44.798 --> 06:46.678
The judge knows everything
that goes on in the city.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.572
That's true.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.841
I'll call Raul
and reschedule the meeting.

06:55.010 --> 06:57.555
No. Don't.

06:57.579 --> 06:59.640
I'll double Tony's security.

06:59.664 --> 07:01.517
It's not just about Tony.

07:01.541 --> 07:03.837
If Dumas attacks us anywhere,

07:03.861 --> 07:06.698
Oksana will think
we can't handle our business.

07:20.102 --> 07:21.829
You know, rumor has it it's, uh...

07:21.853 --> 07:23.782
more fun when you're not drinking alone.

07:25.614 --> 07:27.616
You know there's a
bachelorette party walking in,

07:27.618 --> 07:29.737
and I'd bet they would love
some male entertainment.

07:29.761 --> 07:33.507
Mmm, well, as much I like
to quench a lady's thirst,

07:33.531 --> 07:35.618
I might just sit this one out.

07:35.642 --> 07:38.070
Dipping out on a party? Damn.

07:38.094 --> 07:39.680
I thought you were more fun than that.

07:39.704 --> 07:40.840
I did.

07:40.864 --> 07:42.734
Oh, easy now, girlie.

07:42.758 --> 07:45.845
Mardi Gras 2004, me and Bilal
partied for four days straight.

07:45.869 --> 07:47.271
- Four days?
- Four days.

07:47.295 --> 07:48.388
Okay, four days. That's not bad.

07:48.412 --> 07:49.524
That's not bad.

07:49.548 --> 07:52.132
Is your friend coming back
for Mardi Gras this year?

07:53.986 --> 07:56.896
Uh, yeah, he's not gonna
make it down this year.

08:01.185 --> 08:03.727
Okay, well, there's a seat at the bar

08:03.729 --> 08:04.953
if you want some company

08:16.463 --> 08:17.644
I lost it, Primo.

08:17.668 --> 08:19.954
I shouldn't have killed that gringo.

08:19.978 --> 08:22.348
Besides, we don't know where he is now.

08:22.372 --> 08:24.525
_

08:26.188 --> 08:27.669
_

08:27.694 --> 08:30.581
Pinche racista got exactly
what he deserves.

08:30.605 --> 08:32.357
He's in the trunk of his own car.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.629
No way this even comes back to us.

08:36.453 --> 08:37.972
It's too much for Teresa, man.

08:37.996 --> 08:41.299
With Sinaloa, Dallas, Phoenix,
and now New Orleans.

08:41.323 --> 08:43.634
Andale, Primo. Pick it up.

08:43.658 --> 08:45.107
You don't wanna keep
the boss lady waiting.

08:45.131 --> 08:47.171
Eh, no. No. She can wait.

08:49.607 --> 08:52.086
I got you.

08:52.110 --> 08:54.987
You put up this front,
but you know she's weak.

08:56.614 --> 08:58.224
Sinaloa should have been ours.

08:59.977 --> 09:01.679
It still could be.

09:01.703 --> 09:03.264
You wanna move on Teresa's business?

09:03.288 --> 09:06.809
Teresa's only worried about
expanding into the East Coast.

09:06.833 --> 09:08.951
She's taken her eyes off
the rest of the business.

09:08.953 --> 09:10.978
We'll just be there
to pick up the pieces.

09:13.304 --> 09:14.730
Think about it, Primo.

09:16.186 --> 09:17.869
_

09:20.697 --> 09:22.617
Raul, please call me back.

09:22.641 --> 09:24.785
We need to talk about the Oksana meeting.

09:24.809 --> 09:26.887
Thank you. Bye.

09:26.911 --> 09:31.117
Yo, I got that Intel you asked
for on your Oksana connect.

09:31.141 --> 09:33.185
She escaped from the Graveyard.

09:33.209 --> 09:34.854
It's a women's prison in Chechnya.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.915
Started her Molly game out in Amsterdam

09:36.939 --> 09:38.958
before she set up a distro hub
in Atlanta.

09:38.982 --> 09:40.685
I mean, the woman is no joke.

09:40.709 --> 09:43.811
I'm canceling the meeting until
we settle things with Dumas.

09:44.679 --> 09:45.992
Ah.

09:46.347 --> 09:48.476
Guess that means you need
another man by your side.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.833
All hands on deck.

09:49.835 --> 09:51.854
You should get some rest, George.

09:52.499 --> 09:54.099
Rest?

09:54.123 --> 09:55.767
No, give me a job.

09:55.791 --> 09:57.716
Look, I can't just sit around here.

09:59.255 --> 10:01.422
Put me to work, please.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.234
Okay.

10:03.968 --> 10:05.124
Stay close.

10:09.362 --> 10:10.407
Okay.

10:40.318 --> 10:43.345
Check the area.
I want someone at every exit.

10:47.825 --> 10:48.911
Lock everything down.

10:48.935 --> 10:50.930
As much as... _

10:50.954 --> 10:52.873
I want it dead.

10:52.897 --> 10:54.223
Patron.

11:04.918 --> 11:07.071
Hey, POTE.

11:07.095 --> 11:08.389
We don't need this many guys, okay?

11:08.413 --> 11:09.841
You got bigger problems.

11:09.865 --> 11:12.328
We can't take any chances.

11:12.717 --> 11:14.935
Especially now that the judge
knows you're here.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.018
Well, hey.

11:20.149 --> 11:22.111
Manny and I can protect Tony.

11:22.672 --> 11:24.071
Teresa needs them more than we do so...

11:24.095 --> 11:27.758
Kelly Anne, I don't want
anything to happen to you.

11:27.782 --> 11:29.785
You're always protecting us.

11:29.809 --> 11:33.072
It's my job. Which I better get back to.

11:33.096 --> 11:36.759
Hey. You're a kind man.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.784
You just hide it real well.

11:53.041 --> 11:54.819
Hey, T.

11:54.843 --> 11:56.770
I talked to my contacts.

11:56.794 --> 11:58.772
Word on the street is
Dumas is coming for you.

11:58.796 --> 12:00.274
He knows about Bobby.

12:00.298 --> 12:02.360
We need to lock it down
and take you to safety.

12:02.384 --> 12:04.134
Okay.

12:08.690 --> 12:09.722
Raul.

12:12.361 --> 12:14.914
I need to reschedule our meeting.

12:14.938 --> 12:17.256
There's some business I need to handle.

12:18.762 --> 12:20.343
_

12:20.368 --> 12:22.288
You wanted to go big town.
Pushed for my connect.

12:22.312 --> 12:24.031
I vouched for you.

12:24.055 --> 12:25.253
I understand.

12:25.277 --> 12:26.800
Oksana's not a patient woman.

12:26.824 --> 12:28.841
If you don't show up tonight,

12:28.865 --> 12:31.011
hers won't be the only business you lose.

12:41.134 --> 12:42.778
Close the door!

12:44.739 --> 12:47.963
I'm on a tight schedule here,
Miss Mendoza.

12:47.965 --> 12:50.274
But you had time enough
to visit my friends.

12:52.168 --> 12:54.112
Now, what happened to

12:54.136 --> 12:56.626
all that "mi casa es su casa"
hospitality?

12:57.987 --> 12:59.865
I was just doing a little
background check on you.

12:59.889 --> 13:02.715
Same you did with me.
We're partners, right?

13:04.759 --> 13:06.522
Which is why I'm here.

13:06.927 --> 13:09.017
I'm having problems with Marcel Dumas.

13:09.041 --> 13:10.919
And I know he answers to you.

13:10.943 --> 13:12.637
He's hurting my business.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.895
I would like you to take care of it.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.647
Now, why is that my problem?

13:17.858 --> 13:20.611
No one makes money during a war.

13:20.635 --> 13:21.635
Including you.

13:23.421 --> 13:28.369
This, uh... this conflagration
didn't arise from Dumas

13:28.393 --> 13:31.940
stopping by your little, uh,
distillery, did it?

13:32.286 --> 13:35.539
I'm asking you to stop this
before it starts.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.428
To protect your money.

13:40.992 --> 13:42.626
I'll see what I can do.

13:45.043 --> 13:46.443
For the right price.

13:47.404 --> 13:49.215
I don't know where you got confused,

13:49.239 --> 13:51.358
but you don't come into my office

13:51.382 --> 13:53.265
and start barking orders.

13:55.059 --> 13:58.583
You think you know what
avoiding a war's worth to me?

13:58.607 --> 14:00.091
What's it worth to you?

14:02.294 --> 14:03.579
An extra 10,000.

14:06.606 --> 14:10.745
I reckon 10% is more
appropriate, don't you?

14:10.769 --> 14:12.747
You want me to get my hands dirty,

14:12.771 --> 14:15.032
I'm gonna need more skin in the game.

14:15.621 --> 14:18.419
Think it over. Take your time.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.001
But I wouldn't take too long.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.236
_

14:35.260 --> 14:37.035
You're my problem, cab...

14:39.730 --> 14:41.823
Thank you for your service.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.605
You screw up Teresa
with the little field trip

14:46.629 --> 14:48.282
with Boaz, cabron.

14:48.306 --> 14:50.084
And I'll answer to Teresa,
not you, cabron.

14:50.108 --> 14:52.178
No, pendejo, you answer to me.

14:52.202 --> 14:53.932
I brought you here from Mexico.

14:53.956 --> 14:55.899
I trusted you with her.

14:55.923 --> 14:58.117
Don't make me regret that.

15:01.820 --> 15:02.987
Boaz.

15:16.134 --> 15:19.268
Your Honor, to what do I owe the honor?

15:20.394 --> 15:23.140
I'm gonna need you to lay off
our Mexican friend.

15:24.768 --> 15:27.603
This the same friend who kept
knocking at your door today?

15:28.872 --> 15:32.668
Now, I'm betting these eyes
you got on her

15:32.692 --> 15:35.678
have something to do
with your missing boy.

15:36.654 --> 15:38.107
What do you know about Bobby?

15:38.131 --> 15:41.118
Word is Mendoza's sending you a message.

15:41.142 --> 15:42.803
I'm a God-fearing man,

15:42.827 --> 15:44.280
so here's how it's gonna go.

15:44.304 --> 15:47.424
You get one hit... an eye for an eye...

15:47.448 --> 15:49.685
to put that girl in her place.

15:49.709 --> 15:52.338
After that, we go back
to business as usual.

15:52.362 --> 15:56.112
It seems I always get
the short end of this business.

15:56.136 --> 15:59.051
I'd say you're doing better than most,

15:59.053 --> 16:01.297
thanks to my generosity.

16:04.611 --> 16:05.973
Fine.

16:05.997 --> 16:09.146
And of course I'll be expecting
a little inconvenience fee

16:09.170 --> 16:11.540
for turning a blind eye to this.

16:11.564 --> 16:13.029
Yeah.

16:20.231 --> 16:21.231
Come in.

16:23.986 --> 16:25.387
Hey.

16:25.835 --> 16:27.389
These came for you.

16:31.799 --> 16:34.380
Looks like the lessons are going well.

16:36.076 --> 16:37.867
You know, for what it's worth,

16:37.891 --> 16:39.284
Eddie's one of the good ones.

16:39.308 --> 16:42.536
But I know it's hard
mixing business with pleasure.

16:42.538 --> 16:44.398
Which would you have?

16:44.728 --> 16:46.392
Depends on the day, I guess.

16:46.416 --> 16:48.919
Like, right now I'm just
focusing on my career.

16:48.943 --> 16:52.296
I mean, I have to if I'm gonna
own my own place someday.

16:54.450 --> 16:55.619
Stick around.

16:55.644 --> 16:57.595
We'll see how we can make that happen.

16:58.795 --> 17:00.995
I see what you do here.

17:01.464 --> 17:02.583
I don't wanna lose you.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.425
What, are you kidding?

17:04.450 --> 17:05.665
No.

17:09.169 --> 17:10.731
I don't... I don't know what to say.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.367
Say yes.

17:14.049 --> 17:15.479
Sorry to interrupt.

17:16.010 --> 17:17.842
It's all set. Ready?

17:21.800 --> 17:25.489
Young blood, finally earned your stripes.

17:29.895 --> 17:30.978
Toc.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.507
Ain't no shame in sitting this one out...

17:37.276 --> 17:39.743
No, sir. I'm ready.

17:41.321 --> 17:44.351
Po, you put the word on the street.

17:44.375 --> 17:47.959
Soon as she pops her head up, we hit her.

17:57.945 --> 17:59.275
Here.

18:03.524 --> 18:05.657
_

18:05.682 --> 18:07.437
- Listen, about before...
- It's okay.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.729
I know the risk you took to arrange this.

18:10.347 --> 18:12.054
_

18:12.054 --> 18:13.562
_

18:13.587 --> 18:16.546
My favorite kind. Come on.

18:16.570 --> 18:18.448
Oksana's waiting.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.295
Teresa Mendoza, mi socia, Oksana Volkova.

18:42.690 --> 18:44.134
This is your girl, Raul?

18:45.782 --> 18:48.812
She is more than meets the eye, Oksana.

18:49.434 --> 18:51.637
A toast before we start.

18:53.390 --> 18:54.939
_

18:54.964 --> 18:56.823
_

18:56.848 --> 18:58.848
_

18:58.873 --> 19:00.069
Gracias.

19:00.070 --> 19:01.319
_

19:01.344 --> 19:02.742
Salut.

19:02.743 --> 19:04.743
_

19:21.026 --> 19:22.837
No. No, no, no!

19:25.050 --> 19:26.083
You okay?

19:26.107 --> 19:28.418
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

19:28.442 --> 19:30.903
Fine. Just bored out of my gourd.

19:30.927 --> 19:32.393
Me, too.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.558
We could watch that stupid show you like.

19:35.582 --> 19:38.111
I will have you know that my housewives

19:38.135 --> 19:40.276
lead very interesting lives.

19:41.647 --> 19:44.526
Bet they don't have cartel
soldiers on their couch.

19:44.550 --> 19:48.327
Yeah, well, I will say some
of them have been to prison.

19:51.287 --> 19:53.922
Whatever's going on, it must be bad

19:53.946 --> 19:55.585
if, well, they sent more guys.

19:56.483 --> 20:00.537
All this is... disorienting, huh?

20:01.692 --> 20:03.158
Yeah.

20:05.385 --> 20:09.597
The only certain thing in
Teresa's life is uncertainty.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.471
You know, my mom and I had to move a lot.

20:17.358 --> 20:19.440
She said, "Home isn't a place.

20:20.322 --> 20:21.448
It's a feeling."

20:23.597 --> 20:26.076
So the first thing she'd do in
a new town is find the bakery

20:26.100 --> 20:28.658
and buy tres leches like my abuela made.

20:31.077 --> 20:32.698
We'd eat and play Hearts.

20:33.079 --> 20:35.419
I used to play Hearts with my grandma.

20:35.443 --> 20:36.392
Yeah.

20:36.394 --> 20:38.396
And it won't be like your abuela's,

20:38.420 --> 20:41.188
but I make a pretty mean tres leches.

20:41.523 --> 20:43.208
Hey, I saw some cards in your room.

20:43.645 --> 20:45.438
Well, it's a date.

21:20.209 --> 21:23.471
Atlanta gives you
freeway access to Miami,

21:23.495 --> 21:26.248
New York, Boston, Memphis, Charlotte.

21:26.272 --> 21:28.152
My product lets you move
the highest purity

21:28.154 --> 21:29.739
in the smallest amounts.

21:29.763 --> 21:32.657
Half the risk, twice the money.

21:34.101 --> 21:36.994
Smaller needle in the haystack, huh?

21:37.977 --> 21:42.752
My product, your distribution,
his customers.

21:42.776 --> 21:44.654
We can run the East Coast.

21:50.834 --> 21:52.820
Hey, Tony, we ran out of condensed milk,

21:52.844 --> 21:54.796
so it's just dos leches.

21:57.324 --> 21:58.524
Tony?

22:02.020 --> 22:03.446
Oh, crap.

22:04.748 --> 22:07.560
The purity is 98%.

22:07.584 --> 22:09.003
Your demand will grow and you can...

22:09.027 --> 22:10.967
And I can raise the price.

22:10.969 --> 22:11.974
Exactly.

22:11.976 --> 22:13.089
Smart.

22:13.091 --> 22:14.473
Like I always say...

22:14.609 --> 22:16.018
_

22:20.981 --> 22:22.608
Take care of it.

22:24.610 --> 22:27.195
As I was saying, to our future.

22:27.219 --> 22:28.898
Exactly.

22:28.922 --> 22:32.224
If we do business, Teresa Mendoza,

22:32.226 --> 22:34.771
I need to know, is your house in order?

22:34.795 --> 22:36.244
Of course.

22:40.848 --> 22:42.182
Do we have a deal?

22:46.907 --> 22:49.335
Jasmine, are you sure it's her?

22:57.890 --> 22:59.053
I got men on the way.

22:59.077 --> 23:00.645
I'll be waiting.

23:10.970 --> 23:12.970
She is in the V.I.P. room.

23:13.715 --> 23:15.824
Tic-Toc, post up in the alley.

23:15.826 --> 23:18.446
The ball's gonna drop tonight,
Youngblood.

23:18.470 --> 23:20.364
Try not to shoot them off, all right?

23:37.558 --> 23:40.064
Yo, she got company.

23:41.226 --> 23:43.585
I got a better idea.

23:43.587 --> 23:44.823
Stay here.

23:44.825 --> 23:46.699
Come on.

23:53.613 --> 23:57.409
Mmm, your product is what you say it is.

23:59.785 --> 24:02.373
You know, they have a saying
in this country.

24:02.397 --> 24:04.675
If something is too good to be true,

24:04.699 --> 24:06.032
it usually is.

24:06.034 --> 24:07.188
They have one in Cuba.

24:09.570 --> 24:12.447
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

24:12.449 --> 24:13.692
Yes.

24:13.716 --> 24:17.114
But sometimes a gift horse
is a Trojan horse.

24:17.138 --> 24:19.655
So why should I trust you?

24:19.657 --> 24:21.830
Because I know we're both survivors.

24:21.832 --> 24:23.068
What did you survive?

24:23.070 --> 24:24.645
The streets of Culiacán.

24:24.669 --> 24:27.439
And every second I spent
earning my seat at this table.

24:27.463 --> 24:29.725
That's why she knows a woman
has to be twice as brutal

24:29.749 --> 24:30.982
as a man in this business.

24:30.984 --> 24:34.321
Not as brutal. Twice as smart.

24:40.393 --> 24:42.454
Do you know what this one means?

24:42.478 --> 24:44.540
I went to prison when I was 15.

24:44.564 --> 24:47.084
They claimed I stole some firewood.

24:47.108 --> 24:50.360
But it was really for my proclivities.

24:51.446 --> 24:55.009
I was beaten. Strip-searched.

24:58.511 --> 25:00.679
Kept in solitary.

25:00.681 --> 25:02.658
But it taught me a valuable lesson.

25:02.682 --> 25:03.951
The heart is soft,

25:03.975 --> 25:07.025
but if you're alone, nobody can hurt you.

25:08.944 --> 25:10.533
Where does that leave us?

25:10.557 --> 25:14.386
You made your case. That's enough work.

25:14.410 --> 25:15.721
It's time for pleasure.

25:15.745 --> 25:18.457
A taste of what's to come.

25:18.481 --> 25:20.393
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

25:20.417 --> 25:22.044
One for you.

25:23.436 --> 25:27.124
Ah. One for you.

25:43.940 --> 25:45.294
That was it?

25:45.318 --> 25:47.102
No, I didn't give him my number.

25:47.126 --> 25:49.818
- You didn't?
- Remember that?

25:50.563 --> 25:52.650
It was better than
the last place we went to.

25:52.674 --> 25:53.878
Yeah...

25:57.178 --> 25:58.679
Ah! Your turn, Flaca!

26:01.099 --> 26:03.202
Hey, hey. Hola, guapa.

26:03.226 --> 26:04.437
Ah.

26:04.461 --> 26:05.746
Excuse me.

26:07.688 --> 26:09.588
Nice puppy pile.

26:11.868 --> 26:13.359
Any word from POTE?

26:13.383 --> 26:15.156
Nada.

26:15.180 --> 26:17.606
Stay here. I need to freshen up.

26:19.807 --> 26:21.637
We just make that deal?

26:21.661 --> 26:23.128
Not yet.

26:29.669 --> 26:31.576
I mean he's barely left
the house since we got here.

26:31.600 --> 26:32.709
He doesn't know anybody.

26:32.733 --> 26:34.423
Where do you think he would have gone?

26:37.115 --> 26:38.700
Oh, to find Teresa.

26:39.688 --> 26:42.397
Call him again. Maybe he'll answer.

26:42.657 --> 26:43.833
Okay.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.058
_Shit!

27:05.046 --> 27:06.140
It's okay.

27:46.747 --> 27:48.799
- They're here.
- Go!

27:48.823 --> 27:49.976
Get out of here!

27:59.584 --> 28:01.351
Hey!

28:12.522 --> 28:13.872
God damn it.

28:30.915 --> 28:32.943
You go that way.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.290
You good? We gotta go.

29:36.072 --> 29:37.439
I'm sorry, brother.

29:58.119 --> 30:00.119
Is this at taken.

30:00.479 --> 30:01.871
What do you want??

30:06.176 --> 30:08.152
I want you to come home.

30:08.962 --> 30:10.390
That's not my home.

30:11.007 --> 30:12.616
Maybe not.

30:14.140 --> 30:16.302
But that's my gun you've got.

30:16.566 --> 30:18.734
Hand it over, cabron.

30:26.038 --> 30:28.149
I wanted to help Teresa.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.529
But you didn't know where to go.

30:33.659 --> 30:36.494
My dad started working
in the cartel when he was 14.

30:37.441 --> 30:38.529
I'm 15.

30:38.553 --> 30:41.329
Yeah, look how well
that turned out for him, hmm?

30:41.353 --> 30:43.113
I know he wouldn't want this for you.

30:47.176 --> 30:50.027
You knew him? My dad?

30:51.511 --> 30:53.007
Si.

30:53.031 --> 30:54.222
Were you there?

30:55.557 --> 30:57.018
When he was killed?

30:58.514 --> 30:59.514
No.

31:03.189 --> 31:05.837
But I know that he died like a man.

31:05.861 --> 31:07.610
You know, ever since he died,

31:08.570 --> 31:10.108
people have been trying to kill me too.

31:10.765 --> 31:12.533
And I'm tired of running.

31:13.684 --> 31:14.901
Being helpless.

31:16.814 --> 31:19.601
If someone comes for me again,
I wanna be ready.

31:24.637 --> 31:27.449
I know that Teresa taught you
how to shoot a gun.

31:27.473 --> 31:31.134
But I need to see that you
could handle it safely.

31:31.770 --> 31:35.422
If you do, you can take it.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.934
Are you serious?

31:37.958 --> 31:39.817
This is not a toy, Tony.

31:41.429 --> 31:42.795
This is a tool.

31:44.223 --> 31:48.334
It could protect you or it will kill you.

31:48.336 --> 31:50.881
I need to see that you can handle it.

31:50.905 --> 31:52.680
Then it's yours.

31:56.185 --> 31:57.285
Drop the magazine.

31:58.788 --> 32:00.957
Empty the chamber.

32:00.981 --> 32:02.275
Reload.

32:08.925 --> 32:10.759
This is our secret.

32:12.135 --> 32:13.493
Between men.

32:16.503 --> 32:17.748
Let's go home.

32:36.667 --> 32:38.751
My daddy always used to say

32:38.753 --> 32:41.621
God invented liquor for nights like this.

32:46.836 --> 32:48.862
You saved my life, George.

32:49.572 --> 32:51.825
No, you got that backwards.

32:51.849 --> 32:53.766
I've been off my game.

32:55.105 --> 32:56.575
But you didn't give up on me.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.334
I can't buy what you give me.

32:59.332 --> 33:00.807
Trust.

33:01.442 --> 33:03.910
That being said, I ain't exactly wired

33:03.912 --> 33:05.545
to be Costner to your Whitney.

33:08.858 --> 33:13.494
And tracking shipments ain't
exactly floating my boat.

33:15.490 --> 33:16.956
What are you saying?

33:18.984 --> 33:23.705
Ever since Bilal died, I...

33:24.633 --> 33:26.108
I've been out to sea.

33:29.887 --> 33:31.471
And then that kid tonight...

33:42.892 --> 33:47.372
If we lose this war,
we'll need a safe place.

33:47.396 --> 33:49.349
Maybe you can find one for us.

33:49.373 --> 33:51.468
I ain't leaving you while you're at war.

33:51.492 --> 33:53.159
You're the only one who can do this.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.469
We're in a very vulnerable place.

33:57.254 --> 33:59.105
We need to take precautions.

34:02.703 --> 34:06.016
I used to run guns through Belize.

34:06.040 --> 34:08.882
It's a couple hours away by plane.

34:08.885 --> 34:10.318
Business friendly.

34:12.346 --> 34:14.456
I want you to check it out.

34:25.993 --> 34:28.027
Let me know if you need more.

34:39.330 --> 34:42.081
I guess I should be saddling up.

34:42.668 --> 34:44.379
Be safe, George.

34:44.402 --> 34:45.954
You, too, principessa.

35:12.615 --> 35:14.592
Our men control the block.

35:17.912 --> 35:19.590
No one's getting anywhere near you.

35:20.047 --> 35:21.530
Let's go.

35:32.075 --> 35:33.418
Joint's still jumping.

35:33.443 --> 35:34.550
Yep.

35:34.575 --> 35:35.915
No rest for the wicked.

35:36.063 --> 35:38.241
Now, that's not true.

35:38.265 --> 35:40.266
Teresa's sending me down to the tropics.

35:40.268 --> 35:41.678
Research trip.

35:41.702 --> 35:42.887
What?

35:42.911 --> 35:44.681
How'd you score that?

35:44.705 --> 35:46.872
I've been burning the candle.

35:49.902 --> 35:51.629
Come with me.

35:51.653 --> 35:54.065
Sugar cane rum, fresh ceviche.

35:54.089 --> 35:56.001
- Oh!
- Oceans like bath water.

35:56.025 --> 35:57.336
- Come on now.
- Oh, I can't.

35:57.360 --> 35:58.795
I can't.

35:58.797 --> 36:00.988
Teresa still wants me to stick around.

36:01.012 --> 36:02.947
She said if I keep this up

36:02.971 --> 36:04.933
she'll stake me my own place so...

36:07.127 --> 36:08.605
Good on you, girl.

36:08.629 --> 36:10.347
- You earned it.
- Thanks.

36:10.371 --> 36:11.507
Yeah, I don't know.

36:11.531 --> 36:12.917
What do you think?

36:12.941 --> 36:15.999
How's "Birdie's" sound?

36:16.023 --> 36:18.406
Cold beer, hot owner.

36:20.508 --> 36:23.094
That sounds like a place I'd never leave.

36:24.679 --> 36:26.423
Hey, listen.

36:26.447 --> 36:30.112
Before I forget, I wanna say thanks.

36:30.114 --> 36:31.628
For what?

36:31.652 --> 36:33.194
I was drowning.

36:34.580 --> 36:35.805
You threw me a line.

36:39.576 --> 36:41.327
Oh.

36:41.329 --> 36:42.606
Gentleman George.

36:43.972 --> 36:46.749
Don't let that get out.
You'll ruin my reputation.

36:46.751 --> 36:47.944
- Okay.
- All right?

36:47.968 --> 36:49.746
Hey.

36:49.770 --> 36:50.878
One for the road.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.165
All right, that's more than one.

36:52.189 --> 36:54.632
It's a long-ass road.

37:10.883 --> 37:12.859
What'd you say to him?

37:12.861 --> 37:15.061
Oh, not much.

37:17.166 --> 37:19.394
I guess it's good for him
to have a man around the house

37:19.419 --> 37:21.091
since he lost his daddy so young.

37:22.257 --> 37:23.423
Come here.

37:23.448 --> 37:24.687
Oh.

37:24.780 --> 37:26.808
Oh, my gosh. You're just a giant knot.

37:26.832 --> 37:28.618
I'm fine.

37:28.642 --> 37:31.145
- No, you're not.
- Oh.

37:31.169 --> 37:33.147
It's all the weight you carry.

37:33.171 --> 37:36.090
Teresa and Tony and now me.

37:36.092 --> 37:38.960
It's just... it's a burden.

37:39.377 --> 37:41.054
A burden?

37:42.923 --> 37:44.424
You're not a burden.

37:48.370 --> 37:49.763
A blessing.

37:53.788 --> 37:58.843
Kelly Anne, without you,
I wouldn't be here.

38:02.017 --> 38:03.209
Likewise.

38:33.399 --> 38:34.725
Hello?

38:34.749 --> 38:37.045
You disappeared on us.

38:37.069 --> 38:38.796
Left without saying good-bye.

38:38.820 --> 38:39.957
I'm sorry.

38:39.959 --> 38:41.512
You missed the excitement.

38:41.536 --> 38:43.525
There was a shooting at the club.

38:44.773 --> 38:46.235
Did you make a decision?

38:48.848 --> 38:50.690
I talked to friends.

38:50.714 --> 38:54.994
In Phoenix, Culiacán, Bogotá.

38:56.539 --> 38:58.998
You have a good reputation,
Teresa Mendoza.

39:01.562 --> 39:03.430
I'd be happy to have a new partner.

39:05.037 --> 39:06.646
Me too.

39:07.783 --> 39:09.744
I'll be in touch.

39:19.527 --> 39:21.964
Boaz is back in Sinaloa.

39:25.410 --> 39:28.035
- Javier, I need to know.
- I'm with you.

39:30.432 --> 39:31.884
All in.

39:45.370 --> 39:46.988
An eye for an eye.

39:48.223 --> 39:49.890
Okay.

40:34.952 --> 40:37.040
Government work, huh?

40:37.064 --> 40:38.374
Must be nice.

40:45.755 --> 40:47.323
Get off of me!

40:48.776 --> 40:50.242
Get off!

40:53.547 --> 40:55.623
This is from Dumas.
