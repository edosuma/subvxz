and my husband.</i>

00:43.920 --> 00:46.309
<i>There is our lovely farm.</i>

00:47.400 --> 00:50.358
<i>It's been in my husband's family
for generations.</i>

00:54.120 --> 00:57.829
<i>The sad thing is,
my husband is away, fighting in a war,</i>

00:58.240 --> 00:59.912
<i>so we're on our own.</i>

01:00.240 --> 01:02.754
<i>We're all terribly worried
about him, of course,</i>

01:02.840 --> 01:06.958
<i>but on the whole, I'm coping well.</i>

01:07.920 --> 01:09.399
<i>Very well.</i>

01:09.480 --> 01:12.278
<i>Very well, indeed.</i>

01:12.840 --> 01:15.991

- Get off the furniture!

- You're on the furniture!

01:35.360 --> 01:36.395
<i>We're fine.</i>

01:36.480 --> 01:37.833
Then stop shouting!

01:37.920 --> 01:39.751
We're not shouting. You're shouting.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.191
We are supposed to be getting the farm
spic-and-span

01:43.280 --> 01:45.157
before the cousins arrive tomorrow.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.313
And instead, all you're doing
is fighting, fighting, fighting,

01:49.400 --> 01:54.793
when what I want to be seeing
is sharing, sharing, sharing.

01:55.120 --> 01:59.113
Imagine how sad you'd be
if you had to be taken away from home

01:59.200 --> 02:01.668
because of bombs dropping
all over the place.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.399
- We're not sharing the jam with them.
- What?

02:04.480 --> 02:06.630
We're not sharing Dad's jam
with the cousins.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.154
Oh, no, of course not.
That's for Dad when he comes home.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.152
I'm talking about your room and your toys.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.196
Why won't he reply to my letter?

02:14.280 --> 02:17.590
We're not talking about Dad, darling.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.150
But why won't he reply?
His last one came years ago.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.713
No, darling.

02:25.720 --> 02:26.789
Look.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.353
Three months ago, that's all.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.589
You see?

02:36.240 --> 02:40.552
(SIGHING) Dad's in the Army.
They move him about a lot, that's all it is.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.831
Now, I've got to run,

02:46.920 --> 02:49.036
but you've got to clean up the farm
for the cousins.

02:49.120 --> 02:50.997
What are they actually like, the cousins?

02:51.080 --> 02:54.709
They're city children,
and I imagine they're rather refined.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.756
And I am sure

02:56.840 --> 03:00.879
that they are very well-behaved.

He's vommed all over my shoes!

03:07.800 --> 03:10.633
It's all right, Blenkinsop. Stopped now.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.073
Where are my marshmallows?

03:12.160 --> 03:14.833
Master Cyril,
are them marshmallows a wise choice,

03:14.920 --> 03:16.433
given your recent evacuation?

03:16.520 --> 03:18.829
Marshmallows are always
a wise choice, thanks.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.955
You beast!

03:21.040 --> 03:23.600
You've ruined my brand-new
Fontarelli patent-leather pumps,

03:23.680 --> 03:25.955
and I've left the pale pink at home.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.553
You beast, beast, beast!

03:27.640 --> 03:28.834
Oh, look.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.474

No.

are getting sold tomorrow,

04:35.360 --> 04:38.352
and you said I could scratch them
before they went away.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.830
Dad left me in charge, and what I say goes.
Now, get off.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.388
But Dad built the Scratch-o-Matic for them.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.311
- I said, get off!
- I'm getting off. I'm getting off.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.631

I'm going to check the barley.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.758
- How is my gorgeous sister-in-law?
- No.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.037
Your coat's inside out.
Nylons you need with that skirt.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.189
- No.
- No? No what?

05:20.280 --> 05:22.953
You know perfectly well. "No what?"
I'm not selling.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.678
Isabel, look at me. Look at me.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.399
- Who am I? Who am I?
- You're my brother-in-law.

05:27.480 --> 05:30.995
I'm family, Iz, is all I'm pointing out,
and that's why you can trust me.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.833
All right, Phil. What's your point?

05:33.920 --> 05:35.273
Lz, we need to sell the farm, now.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.715
You haven't even got enough money
for tomorrow's payment on the tractor,

05:37.800 --> 05:39.279
and if there's no tractor,
there's no harvest.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.873
If there's no harvest, the farm will fail.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.359
I said no.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.556
And actually, Norman's thought of a way
to get some money,

05:44.640 --> 05:46.631
so I will make the payment on the tractor.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.359
- Has he, indeed? What way would that be?
- I'm in a hurry, Phil.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.716
Isabel, I can't point it out enough
that I need the money.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.836
I'm only human, but that farm is half...

05:54.920 --> 05:57.195
Half Rory's and half
yours. Yes, yes, I know.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.748
I know, because you tell me
every time I see you.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.035
But you can't sell it without my permission,

06:02.120 --> 06:04.156

Shoo!

These children require five lessons,
Mrs Green.

25:35.680 --> 25:39.195
Lesson one, to stop fighting, is complete.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.831
They've stopped fighting?

You should be able to have
a little time to yourself.

We're not fighting.

26:09.760 --> 26:13.036
I can see that, Vincent. Thank you.

26:13.120 --> 26:15.759
Look, I don't know
how all that happened downstairs,

26:15.840 --> 26:18.354
but I'm in charge here,
and I don't need some nanny to help.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.396
CYRIL: My sister and I
aren't even part of this family,

26:20.480 --> 26:23.711
so whomever you've come to look after,
it certainly isn't us.

26:24.520 --> 26:26.476
Listen to me very carefully.

26:27.120 --> 26:29.918
I am going to explain to you the way I work.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.396
When you need me but do not want me,

26:34.480 --> 26:36.038
then I must stay.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.712
When you want me but no longer need me,

26:40.680 --> 26:42.272
then I have to go.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.396
How could anyone possibly want you?

26:44.720 --> 26:48.110
Well, it's an odd thought, I grant you,
but there it is.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.440
Now, to business.
In the absence of any spare beds,

26:51.520 --> 26:54.034
Norman, I presume,
will be sharing with Cyril?

26:54.120 --> 26:56.429
(SCOFFING) I'd rather share with a goat.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.795
A goat wouldn't have
you, and neither will I.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.393
I see.

27:00.480 --> 27:03.711
Celia, Megsie,
would you be willing to share a bed?

27:03.800 --> 27:05.836
I'm not sharing anything
with that vicious harpy.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.753
- I'd rather share with Geraldine.
- She's our cow.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.832

I don't have to share.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.078
He's not weak-willed.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.878
It was him who saved the piglets

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.793
and him that thought of helping us
by coming here.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.836
And I know I'm right about my father.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.480
Please, can't you just inquire?

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.592
There are thousands of men
fighting in my army.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.672
Why should I give your father,
however worthy he may be,

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.478
my special attention?

01:07:58.720 --> 01:07:59.994
Because...

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.113
Because they love him,
and so does Auntie Isabel,

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.679
and they need him.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.395
And I know why you sent us away
to them, too.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.358
It had nothing to do with bombs.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.519
I know you and Mother are getting a divorce.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.512
- Enough!
- No, you will listen!

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.908
You've made your lives
and our lives a misery.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.911
Isn't that enough for you?

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:25.993
At least help Aunt Isabel and Uncle Rory
to be together.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:53.394

Are they really going to get a divorce,
your mum and dad?

01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.633
So who will you live with?

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.676
My mother, I suppose.
Won't make much difference.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:06.228
We hardly ever see him or her.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.912
We only ever get wheeled out for them
on special occasions.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:16.877
You can come live with us, you know.
You and Celia.

What does it say?

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.032
I'm afraid he's M.I.A.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.797
- What's that?
- Missing in action.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.152
I'm sorry, Norman.

"Missing in action," not "killed in action"?

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.909
Not killed.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.276
The telegram you received was incorrect.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:04.273
In fact, there's no record of any telegram
having been sent.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.916
Which is something we should look into...

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.036
NORMAN: I knew it. He's alive.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.599
Thank you, Uncle.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.274
He's my nephew. He's a country boy.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.550
"Rough diamond," as they say.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.556

I will, sir.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.275
Right-o.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.468
Norman, if the War Office
never sent that telegram,

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.755
it means the one you saw was forged,

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:18.116
but who would forge a telegram
saying someone was dead?

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:20.555
- Who would do something that awful?
- Uncle Phil.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.234
He's been trying to get Mum
to sell our half of the farm.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:26.039
He must have known she'd sell
if she thought Dad was dead.

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.109
We've got to hurry.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.353
He's not dead. He's only missing.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.793
That is good news.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.429
But we've got to get back quickly.
We'll explain on the way.

There is no mouse.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.836
I saw it. Must have escaped.

Right.

That's enough, Megsie.

- Another pen. Right.

my stick, please?

01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:14.318
Actually, better still,

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.790
could you just bang it down
on the road once, quite hard?

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.355
Go on.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.992
Don't drop it.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:27.392

simply doesn't bear thinking about.

Well done. Put it back.

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.951
- What did it do?
- What?

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.237
When Norman banged the stick,
what was it for?

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:50.915
Hello.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:04.354
Mum, please, don't. It's our farm.
Don't sign it.

Oh! So is this.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.879
