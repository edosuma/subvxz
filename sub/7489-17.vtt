WEBVTT

00:04.056 --> 00:08.159
Wow, Trish, you really went all out
for our team Austin and Ally meeting.

00:08.160 --> 00:10.021
Yeah, you've never had
it catered before.

00:10.022 --> 00:12.762
Nothing but the best
for my clients.

00:12.763 --> 00:18.555
Why does the cake say "Mazel Tov on
your Bar Mitzvah, Danny Shapiro".

00:18.556 --> 00:23.116
Okay fine. You got me.
They're leftovers.

00:23.758 --> 00:26.800
Guess who got a job at
High Class Catering.

00:26.801 --> 00:31.076
Well, thank you, Danny Shapiro, for
not eating your cocktail weenies.

00:31.077 --> 00:33.178
Yeah, these things are awesome.

00:33.179 --> 00:37.215
All right, let's start the meeting.
Austin's up first.

00:37.216 --> 00:40.204
Okay, next week you have
a gig at the beach club,

00:40.205 --> 00:42.903
rehearsals with your dancers
and two days in the studio.

00:42.904 --> 00:44.306
- Yes!
- I know.

00:44.307 --> 00:46.805
You got a lot of exciting
stuff next week.

00:46.806 --> 00:51.062
No, "yes" because I don't
have anything this week.

00:51.063 --> 00:53.685
I can have my first
vacation all year.

00:53.686 --> 00:56.538
This calls for a
cocktail weenie.

00:56.539 --> 00:58.036
Woo, vacation!

00:58.037 --> 01:01.976
I say we go to the beach every day, play
video games and sleep in until noon.

01:01.977 --> 01:03.863
What up?

01:03.864 --> 01:06.660
You realize you still
have school, right?

01:06.661 --> 01:08.013
Aw.

01:08.014 --> 01:10.555
Thanks for ruining my vacation.

01:10.556 --> 01:12.404
Moving on to Ally.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.152
I have some great
news for you too.

01:14.153 --> 01:17.355
You've been nominated as one of
"Miami Music" magazine's future five.

01:17.356 --> 01:19.814
No way, that's awesome.

01:19.815 --> 01:21.226
What does that mean?!

01:21.227 --> 01:24.555
Ever year, "Miami Music" picks
five up-and-coming singers

01:24.556 --> 01:26.684
that they think are gonna
be the next big thing.

01:26.685 --> 01:29.820
People vote online and choose one
future star out of the five.

01:29.821 --> 01:31.971
This is so great, Trish.

01:31.972 --> 01:35.068
Do you know how many cool
singers have won that contest?

01:35.069 --> 01:37.042
Ah, 17?

01:37.043 --> 01:38.985
4? 112?

01:38.986 --> 01:42.351
17! Oh, I already guessed that.

01:42.352 --> 01:46.117
The future five is a big deal, Ally. It
could really take you to the next level.

01:46.118 --> 01:48.748
The magazine editor
Jean Paul Paul-Jean,

01:48.749 --> 01:51.626
is throwing a party at his loft
tomorrow night for the nominees.

01:51.627 --> 01:53.817
Tomorrow night? I
have so much to do.

01:53.818 --> 01:57.461
I have to buy a new outfit, get
my hair done and pick up a gift.

01:57.462 --> 02:00.098
I don't think you have to bring
a gift to the nominee party.

02:00.099 --> 02:02.277
No, it's for Danny Shapiro.

02:02.278 --> 02:06.838
To thank him for his
Bar Mitzvah weenies.

02:09.276 --> 02:12.276
Hello. Oh hey, boss.

02:12.353 --> 02:13.611
What?!

02:13.612 --> 02:16.350
Uh, I'm on my way to
the Bar Mitzvah now.

02:16.351 --> 02:18.658
I'm just stuck in traffic.

02:18.659 --> 02:22.319
Guys, those weren't leftovers!

02:28.074 --> 02:31.176
<i>♪ When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:31.177 --> 02:34.311

03:10.217 --> 03:14.657
<i>♪ Do it without ya,

03:21.513 --> 03:27.393
Wow. "Miami Music" magazine sure
knows how to throw a party.

03:27.686 --> 03:30.291
Hey, Trish. You look nice.

03:30.292 --> 03:32.231
And you're here early.

03:32.232 --> 03:34.677
Actually, I'm
catering this party.

03:34.678 --> 03:37.378
And I was late.

03:38.166 --> 03:41.768
Hey, there's the editor
Jean Paul Paul-Jean.

03:41.769 --> 03:46.647
Welcome, beautiful people to
Miami Music's future five...

03:46.648 --> 03:49.048
Extravaganza!

03:49.067 --> 03:51.765
Or as the Italians
like to say...

03:51.766 --> 03:54.166
Extravaganza!

03:54.660 --> 03:58.716
And you wouldn't let me wear my cape
because you said I'd look stupid.

03:58.717 --> 04:04.617
I'd like to introduce our five
nominees, each of which is so panda.

04:05.557 --> 04:09.157
The means beautiful and rare.

04:10.294 --> 04:13.714
Hip-hop artist Lil' Jumpy!

04:13.859 --> 04:17.939
Future country star
Billy Joe Burns!

04:18.087 --> 04:20.036
R&B phenom...

04:20.036 --> 04:22.737
Chandelier Baker!

04:23.085 --> 04:24.095
Pop diva Uniqua!

04:24.096 --> 04:26.796
Pop diva Uniqua!

04:26.804 --> 04:29.058
And multitalented
singer-hyphen-songwriter...

04:29.059 --> 04:31.916
And multitalented
singer-hyphen-songwriter...

04:31.917 --> 04:34.317
Ally Dawson!

04:34.368 --> 04:37.755
Now let's hear some applause.

04:37.756 --> 04:40.657
Or as the French like to say...

04:40.658 --> 04:42.818
Applause!

04:43.528 --> 04:45.533
- Go Ally!
- We're so proud of you.

04:45.534 --> 04:47.631
You're so panda.

04:47.632 --> 04:52.618
This year all of our nominees will be
posting a new music video on our website...

04:52.619 --> 04:57.466
So the fans can vote for
our winning future star.

04:57.467 --> 04:59.972
Cool, we get to make a video.

04:59.973 --> 05:01.718
Now!

05:01.719 --> 05:05.416
Let's celebrate with our feet.

05:05.417 --> 05:07.697
Woo! Yeah!

05:08.323 --> 05:10.231
That means dance.

05:10.232 --> 05:12.006
Oh.

05:12.007 --> 05:13.927
Yeah.

05:17.980 --> 05:21.832
Thank you so much for nominating
me, Jean Paul Paul-Jean.

05:21.833 --> 05:25.239
I would shake your hand, but then I would
have to shake everyone else's hand.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.194
And, ooh, who has time for that?

05:28.195 --> 05:31.199
Hello, Jean Paul Paul-Jean.
I don't believe we've met.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.171
Well, I usually don't mingle
with the catering staff.

05:34.172 --> 05:36.047
Well, I'm also Ally's manager.

05:36.048 --> 05:40.885
- Crab cake?
- Oh, pleasure to meet you, crab cake.

05:40.886 --> 05:42.623
Hey! And Austin Moon!

05:42.624 --> 05:44.655
Hey! And Austin Moon!

05:44.656 --> 05:45.756
What a thrill!

05:45.757 --> 05:47.582
You are more than panda.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.760
You are albino panda.

05:49.761 --> 05:52.298
There is only one in the world.

05:52.299 --> 05:54.082
Thanks, Mr. Paul-Jean.

05:54.083 --> 05:57.568
Oh, Mr. Paul-Jean is my Father.

05:57.569 --> 06:01.349
Call me... Jean Paul Paul-Jean.

06:02.223 --> 06:04.823
Jean Paul Paul-Jean, I'm Dez.

06:04.824 --> 06:07.128
Thank you so much for
inviting us to your party.

06:07.129 --> 06:12.480
You're so generous to give us
gift bags, gum, lip gloss...

06:12.481 --> 06:14.461
Cash?!

06:15.206 --> 06:18.446
That's someone's purse.

06:19.167 --> 06:21.027
Hey!

06:21.726 --> 06:24.779
So what do you think Ally's chances
are of winning this contest?

06:24.780 --> 06:27.033
Oh! I don't see
how she can lose.

06:27.034 --> 06:31.702
She's a fabulous singer, sensational
musician, brilliant songwriter.

06:31.703 --> 06:34.321
There's nothing she can't do...

06:34.322 --> 06:36.122
Oh.

06:37.263 --> 06:41.478
It appears there's one
thing she can't do.

06:41.479 --> 06:44.599
That is so not panda.

06:52.524 --> 06:54.291
Aah.

06:54.292 --> 06:56.359
I love being on vacation.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.594
Too bad it's been raining.

06:57.595 --> 07:01.121
Would have been nice to go to a real
beach with some real beach babes.

07:01.122 --> 07:04.742
Don't worry. I made some calls.

07:04.743 --> 07:06.993
Hello, ladies.

07:06.994 --> 07:10.151
Woo-hoo. I love my life.

07:10.152 --> 07:13.272
I love your life too.

07:13.380 --> 07:16.379
Can, uh, one of you
put sunblock on me?

07:16.380 --> 07:19.320
I'll do it, buddy.

07:20.008 --> 07:22.842
Dez, I wanted the
beach babes to do it.

07:22.843 --> 07:28.483
With their tiny little girl hands?
It would take forever.

07:28.526 --> 07:30.706
Sorry to interrupt your
little fake vacation,

07:30.707 --> 07:33.033
but I just spoke to
Jean Paul Paul-Jean.

07:33.034 --> 07:36.981
And he doesn't think Ally can win the
future five contest with her bad dancing.

07:36.982 --> 07:39.479
She's not that bad.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.079
And it's not like anybody
voting is gonna see her dance.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.928
Maybe you're right.

07:43.929 --> 07:46.623
There's probably nothing
to worry about.

07:46.624 --> 07:50.119
Guys, I know what I'm gonna
do for my future five video.

07:50.120 --> 07:56.020
I'm gonna write a dance song and show
the world my awesome dance moves.

07:56.387 --> 08:01.487
Okay, there's definitely
something to worry about.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:14.474 --> 08:15.893
What are you doing?

08:15.894 --> 08:18.350
Working on some more
cool dance moves.

08:18.351 --> 08:22.164
Wash the window.
Wash the window.

08:22.165 --> 08:25.705
Dry my hands. Dry my hands.

08:25.916 --> 08:28.985
Listen, Ally. We wanted to
talk to you about your video.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.779
My dance video?

08:30.780 --> 08:33.416
Let's just call it
a video for now.

08:33.417 --> 08:36.601
We really want you to win the
future five competition.

08:36.602 --> 08:40.638
So we thought we should talk about what
we actually want to see in the video.

08:40.639 --> 08:44.479
And what we don't want to see.

08:45.487 --> 08:48.680
We thought we would make a list of
your strengths and your weaknesses.

08:48.681 --> 08:51.132
Let's start with strengths.

08:51.133 --> 08:53.195
You're an amazing songwriter.

08:53.196 --> 08:55.232
You're a fantastic singer.

08:55.233 --> 08:57.027
Incredible musician.

08:57.028 --> 08:59.728
You're adorable.

09:01.830 --> 09:05.051
This is fun. Great idea, guys.

09:05.052 --> 09:07.648
That's a lot of strengths.

09:07.649 --> 09:09.401
Oh, look.

09:09.402 --> 09:13.346
Here's something else
you do, dancing.

09:13.347 --> 09:15.207
Hmm.

09:15.708 --> 09:18.780
Where do you think we
should put this card?

09:18.781 --> 09:21.446
Strength? Weakness?

09:21.447 --> 09:24.267
Strength? Weakness?

09:25.618 --> 09:26.886
Uh...

09:26.887 --> 09:29.047
Strength.

09:30.556 --> 09:32.956
Guess again.

09:35.293 --> 09:39.431
Weakness? But my dancing's
really improved this year.

09:39.432 --> 09:42.768
People couldn't take their
eyes off me last night.

09:42.769 --> 09:46.330
People can't take their eyes off me
when I have spinach in my teeth but,

09:46.331 --> 09:50.478
I'm not making a spinach
in my teeth video.

09:50.479 --> 09:55.654
Look. I like an organized
chart as much as anyone.

09:55.655 --> 09:59.957
But I love my dancing. I don't
care what anyone else thinks.

09:59.958 --> 10:03.388
Ha, wash the window.
Wash the window.

10:03.389 --> 10:04.814
Dry my hands.

10:04.815 --> 10:07.335
Dry my hands.

10:09.595 --> 10:14.840
If she won't listen to us, we need
to show her how bad a dancer she is.

10:14.841 --> 10:18.108
I know. We'll get her to
dance and video tape it.

10:18.109 --> 10:21.079
Great idea. I know
just how to do it.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.864
We'll rinse out the gym, throw
a fake Homecoming Dance,

10:23.865 --> 10:28.083
hire 500 actors to play students, tell
them to vote Ally Homecoming Queen,

10:28.084 --> 10:30.021
and when she comes out
for the first dance...

10:30.022 --> 10:31.616
Bam!

10:31.617 --> 10:34.857
We'll film her dancing.

10:37.457 --> 10:41.303
Or we could just follow her around, wait
for her to dance and then film her.

10:41.304 --> 10:43.524
Uh, fine.

10:43.562 --> 10:48.499
But just so you know, I was gonna
make you fake Homecoming King.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.660
Aw, man.

10:57.432 --> 11:01.163
We've been following her for three
hours and she hasn't danced yet.

11:01.164 --> 11:03.864
I have an idea.

11:04.168 --> 11:06.618
Hey, Ally. How'd you
do on your test?

11:06.619 --> 11:08.853
- I got an "A".
- Yay, victory dance.

11:08.854 --> 11:10.348
- Woo-oo!
- Woo!

11:10.349 --> 11:12.624
Come on, why aren't you dancing?

11:12.625 --> 11:14.826
I always get "A" s.

11:14.827 --> 11:20.727
If I danced every time I got a good
grade, my feet would fall off. Bam.

11:20.766 --> 11:22.891
I got this.

11:22.892 --> 11:24.313
Check it out.

11:24.314 --> 11:27.918
Flash mob! Everybody join me.
Come on, Ally.

11:27.919 --> 11:30.739
Six, seven, eight.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.717
Guess I got the time wrong.

11:39.718 --> 11:41.951
We're never gonna
get Ally to dance.

11:41.952 --> 11:46.558
I still have one last idea,
but it's kind of a long shot.

11:46.559 --> 11:49.694
Hey, Ally, can you do your
dance so Dez can film it?

11:49.695 --> 11:51.615
Sure.

11:58.488 --> 12:01.488
Well, that was easy.

12:05.543 --> 12:08.423
Best vacation ever.

12:10.798 --> 12:14.578
Oh, I think I caught something.

12:19.192 --> 12:21.777
I got it. I got it.
He's struggling.

12:21.778 --> 12:24.478
He's struggling.

12:27.055 --> 12:30.955
- Woo!
- Put it with the others.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.466
Ally's coming.

12:33.467 --> 12:38.867
Great, now we can show her
the video of her dancing.

12:38.875 --> 12:41.716
Hey, Ally, we're gonna watch a movie.
Come join us.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.707
Oh, cool. What kind of
movie are we watching?

12:43.708 --> 12:49.608
It's kind of a horror film
slash-comedy-slash-disaster film.

12:49.638 --> 12:54.318
We're gonna go right
to the disaster part.

12:58.797 --> 13:01.437
Oh, the horror.

13:02.735 --> 13:05.125
Very funny. That's not a movie.

13:05.126 --> 13:09.266
That's just me
dancing in the Mall.

13:09.405 --> 13:12.628
Wow, I've never really
seen myself dance before.

13:12.629 --> 13:15.507
Speaks for itself, right?

13:15.508 --> 13:16.846
Yeah.

13:16.847 --> 13:22.276
I knew my dancing was getting better,
but I didn't know it was that good.

13:22.277 --> 13:24.497
Seriously?

13:25.174 --> 13:28.842
Look, Ally, I don't know
how to say this but,

13:28.843 --> 13:33.676
you look like a chimp trying
to climb an invisible rope.

13:33.677 --> 13:35.460
No one thinks that.

13:35.461 --> 13:39.121
Silly monkey, climb that rope.

13:39.703 --> 13:43.758
Look, Ally, Jean Paul Paul-Jean
doesn't think you'll win the contest,

13:43.759 --> 13:45.495
if people see you
dance like that.

13:45.496 --> 13:48.793
So Jean Paul Paul-Jean
doesn't like my dancing.

13:48.794 --> 13:51.788
That doesn't mean other
people won't love it.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.274
I'll prove it to you. I'll
put it online myself.

13:54.275 --> 13:55.952
What are you doing?!

13:55.953 --> 14:00.402
Showing you that not
everybody hates my dancing.

14:00.403 --> 14:03.364
Wow. Look at all the
comments already.

14:03.365 --> 14:05.765
"You stink".

14:06.538 --> 14:11.666
"You look like a chimp trying
to climb an invisible rope".

14:11.667 --> 14:16.826
The Fire Department wants to
know if I need assistance.

14:16.827 --> 14:20.368
Okay, so maybe everybody
does hate my dancing.

14:20.369 --> 14:22.122
Oh, hey, there's positive one.

14:22.123 --> 14:27.103
Oh. "I hate your dancing,
but you're adorable".

14:27.430 --> 14:28.759
Thanks, Dez.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.400
You're welcome.

14:40.423 --> 14:44.015
Look on the bright side, Ally.
Your video has 30 likes.

14:44.016 --> 14:46.997
But I got 3,000 dislikes.

14:46.998 --> 14:50.958
I said "look on
the bright side".

14:52.655 --> 14:54.984
I don't care about
these comments.

14:54.985 --> 14:57.135
I'm still making my video.

14:57.136 --> 14:59.726
Ally, if people are
making fun of you now,

14:59.727 --> 15:03.148
think what'll happen if you actually
make an entire dance video.

15:03.149 --> 15:08.969
They're only making fun of me
because they have no vision.

15:08.987 --> 15:13.787
No, I think the problem
is they have vision.

15:15.524 --> 15:19.476
Jean Paul Paul-Jean?
What are you doing here?

15:19.477 --> 15:21.558
No time for small talk.

15:21.559 --> 15:26.087
I don't know if you can
tell, but I am very upset.

15:26.088 --> 15:28.498
All right. Fine, you caught me.

15:28.499 --> 15:33.676
I'm the guy who went into your closet and
tried on all your capes at the party.

15:33.677 --> 15:36.207
That's not why I'm here.

15:36.208 --> 15:40.322
Then I'm not the
guy who did that.

15:40.323 --> 15:43.648
I am upset because I saw this...

15:43.649 --> 15:46.349
On the Internet!

15:48.921 --> 15:52.041
That is so not panda.

15:53.024 --> 15:58.792
People are questioning my decision
to include Ally in the future five.

15:58.793 --> 16:00.683
We're sorry about
that video clip.

16:00.684 --> 16:06.345
We promise that you won't be disappointed
when Ally's real music video comes out.

16:06.346 --> 16:08.028
I hope not.

16:08.029 --> 16:11.111
I do not do well with...

16:11.112 --> 16:13.065
Disappointment.

16:13.066 --> 16:16.130
Or as the Germans say...

16:16.131 --> 16:18.651
Disappointment.

16:23.077 --> 16:24.688
Wow.

16:24.689 --> 16:28.769
That guy speaks a
lot of languages.

16:35.105 --> 16:37.004
Working on some new moves?

16:37.005 --> 16:40.045
No, I'm trying to catch a fly.

16:40.046 --> 16:41.671
Oh.

16:41.672 --> 16:44.765
It's kind of hard
to tell with you.

16:44.766 --> 16:48.083
Listen, Ally, we really want
you to win that contest.

16:48.084 --> 16:50.447
Are you sure you still want
to make a dance video?

16:50.448 --> 16:51.975
Yes, Austin.

16:51.976 --> 16:54.551
I don't care if everybody
doesn't like my dancing.

16:54.552 --> 16:55.986
I like it.

16:55.987 --> 17:00.229
And that's why I'm gonna make
and awesome dance video.

17:00.230 --> 17:02.392
Wow, you really
believe in yourself.

17:02.393 --> 17:05.781
If I didn't believe in myself, I
wouldn't be in the future five.

17:05.781 --> 17:08.393
Or the believe-in-yourself club.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.016
You know what?

17:10.017 --> 17:13.723
I'm gonna help you make your video.
I'll cancel the rest of my vacation.

17:13.723 --> 17:18.464
You know, you were never
really on vacation.

17:19.132 --> 17:23.131
Okay, you can help, but
you got to do it my way.

17:23.132 --> 17:25.523
The Ally way.

17:25.525 --> 17:28.258
The Ally way! That's a
great name for the song.

17:28.259 --> 17:30.465
Way ahead of you.

17:30.466 --> 17:33.477
I'm also in the
great-song-namers club.

17:33.478 --> 17:36.015
How do you have time
for all these clubs?

17:36.016 --> 17:40.696
Well, I'm in the
time-management club too.

17:51.850 --> 17:53.645
Hey, that's not funny.

17:53.646 --> 17:55.375
You want me to say something?

17:55.376 --> 17:57.864
No. They're just jealous.

17:57.865 --> 17:59.602
Why is that?

17:59.603 --> 18:02.083
Because I'm doing it my way...

19:29.440 --> 19:31.747
Ally Dawson!

19:31.748 --> 19:33.113
Ally Dawson!

19:33.114 --> 19:36.867
The fact that she made her dance
move into something cool...

19:36.868 --> 19:38.902
Is more than albino panda.

19:38.903 --> 19:43.223
It's albino panda
wearing a turtleneck.

19:43.353 --> 19:47.673
Rare and almost
impossible to pull off.

19:47.811 --> 19:50.219
- Congrats, Ally.
- You rock.

19:50.220 --> 19:54.103
I take back everything I ever said about
that stupid believe-in-yourself club.

19:54.104 --> 19:55.880
I never doubted you, Ally.

19:55.881 --> 19:57.146
Yeah, you did.

19:57.147 --> 19:59.865
Oh, yeah. I did, didn't I?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.544
Speech! Speech!

20:01.545 --> 20:05.087
Or as they say in Pig Latin, "eech-spay!
Eech-spay!"

20:05.088 --> 20:08.612
Jean Paul isn't the only one
who knows foreign languages.

20:08.613 --> 20:11.373
Hat-way up-way!

20:11.682 --> 20:14.938
I just want to thank my friends
for helping me make the video.

20:14.939 --> 20:17.487
And everyone who voted for me.

20:17.488 --> 20:20.410
I only have two pieces of
advice for everyone here.

20:20.411 --> 20:24.214
Stay true to yourself and don't
forget to tip your caterer.

20:24.215 --> 20:26.260
Oh, thanks, Ally.

20:26.261 --> 20:29.215
By the way, nobody touch the
"Happy Birthday Clarissa" cake.

20:29.216 --> 20:31.762
There's a four-year-old girl
that's about to have a fit.

20:31.763 --> 20:34.883
I'm on my way, boss.

20:36.290 --> 20:38.210

This is relaxing.

21:05.674 --> 21:09.113
Told you. Want to go
instrument fishing?

21:09.114 --> 21:12.408
Nah, zero times is enough.

21:12.409 --> 21:15.712
