05:58.091 --> 05:59.956
that he won't be chill.

06:00.226 --> 06:01.693

Oh, my God, of course.
Everyone's on so much medication now

09:53.859 --> 09:55.326
that nobody wants to have sex anyway.

09:55.394 --> 09:57.658
Yeah, I guess it's true what they say.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.130
"It's better to have said
a quick what's up and lost

10:00.199 --> 10:02.167
"than to have never said a quick what's up."

10:12.345 --> 10:14.939
Dating apps. Mark is very familiar.

10:15.014 --> 10:16.914
- Yeah.
- Mark, what, um...

10:17.383 --> 10:19.749
Who have you said no to?
Like, what was the situation

10:19.819 --> 10:21.150
where you said no to sex with a woman?

10:21.287 --> 10:24.381
We had sex and it was bad,
then I said no to the second one.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.693
- How did you say no?
- I didn't answer the phone.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.694
- That's a clear no.
- I gotta tell you this "no" story.

10:29.862 --> 10:32.626
I told this woman no,
I couldn't have sex with her

10:32.698 --> 10:35.724
because she started
telling me about her son,

10:36.102 --> 10:37.831
- and how sick he was.
- Ooh, that's hot.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.734
And how he had, like, eight surgeries.

10:39.872 --> 10:42.033
- Ugh.
- This is in the middle of us trying to hook up,

10:42.108 --> 10:43.598
- she starts telling me that.
- Ugh.

10:43.676 --> 10:45.439
And I was just like, yeah, I can't.

10:45.511 --> 10:46.535
I can't do it.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.944
And I'm sorry, but all I kept thinking was,

10:49.015 --> 10:51.347
is that gonna happen to me
if I have sex with her?

10:51.417 --> 10:53.851
- Like, you're gonna catch her son's thing?
- That's what I kept thinking.

10:53.919 --> 10:56.786
I know it's totally irrational,
but that's what I kept thinking.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.255
Like, it's her vagina's fault

10:58.324 --> 11:00.383
and I'm not going anywhere near that vagina.

11:00.459 --> 11:03.155
What's the oldest woman
you would have sex with?

11:03.229 --> 11:05.356
The oldest I've had sex with is 48.

11:05.431 --> 11:07.592
- How old were you?
- 17.

11:08.134 --> 11:09.328
- Was that your virginity?
- Yes.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.391
- Oh, my God.
- Really?

11:10.469 --> 11:12.096
- You lost your virginity to an older woman.
- Oh, yeah.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.036
You must be...
You should be great in bed, then.

11:14.106 --> 11:15.573
- No...
- No, there's no way.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.336
- She was a real pro.
- Really?

11:17.410 --> 11:18.741
I couldn't keep up, yeah,
and I think it scarred me.

11:18.811 --> 11:21.177
- That's why I would assume you were great.
- Was she a real pro, like...

11:21.247 --> 11:22.737
I think she was a prostitute,
but she didn't charge me.

11:22.815 --> 11:23.804
Okay.

11:27.053 --> 11:28.577
My name's Tanya Chambers.

11:28.654 --> 11:31.316
I'm a normal,
sexually aggressive woman by day,

11:31.390 --> 11:34.120
but I have a very special gift, also by day.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.622
I'm a snake doctor.

11:39.098 --> 11:40.895
This snake is sick. I fixed your snake!

11:43.469 --> 11:45.460
This snake is sick. I fixed your snake!

11:47.707 --> 11:50.107
This snake is sick. I fixed your snake!

11:54.480 --> 11:57.278
Everywhere I go, there are sick snakes
that I have to help,

11:57.349 --> 11:59.010
because if I don't,

11:59.118 --> 12:00.483
all the snakes will die.

12:02.688 --> 12:04.747
I would have rather just brought
him to a vet, to be honest,

12:04.824 --> 12:06.189
- but she's supposed to be the best.
- Hooroo!

12:06.258 --> 12:07.589
I'm here to fix your snake!

12:07.660 --> 12:10.493
Here, I brought Scandal with me
to keep your snake calm,

12:10.563 --> 12:12.622
'cause snakes like other snakes. Whoa!

12:12.698 --> 12:14.188
Did it die already?

12:14.266 --> 12:15.961
Oh, no, she's just resting.

12:16.035 --> 12:18.731
Thank you so much for coming,
we're really worried about her.

12:18.804 --> 12:22.865
Lizzie is the last gift
that my mother got me before...

12:24.110 --> 12:25.099
I'm sorry.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.202
I just think if she died,
it would be like losing my mom

12:27.613 --> 12:28.944
all over again.

12:29.014 --> 12:30.481
We really appreciate you being here.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.073
Cool, do you guys have any food?

12:32.151 --> 12:33.516
I feel like something hot.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.645
Um, we have some soup left over.

12:35.821 --> 12:37.584
Does it have any meat or sausage in it?

12:37.823 --> 12:39.154
- No.
- I don't want it, then.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.691
Uh, Lizzie means a great deal
to Amy and I, so...

12:44.663 --> 12:46.130
Bloody hell.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.132
No one told me you were Australian.

12:48.534 --> 12:49.660
Is that a problem?

12:49.902 --> 12:52.234
Only if being horny as hell is a problem.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.835
Uh, okay, well, Lizzie has not been herself.

12:55.908 --> 12:58.934
She's not moving very much
and she's getting night sweats.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.611
Just take a look at her. Oh!

13:02.782 --> 13:04.147
(SCREAMING)

13:04.216 --> 13:06.446
- What is it? I hate it!
- Lizzie!

13:06.652 --> 13:07.949
- Lizzie?
- Lizzie!

13:08.020 --> 13:09.510
Lizzie is a lizard!

13:09.622 --> 13:12.557
I love snakes, but I absolutely hate lizards.

13:12.858 --> 13:14.587
Lizards are a myth.

13:15.261 --> 13:16.592
And she's been very weak.

13:16.662 --> 13:18.425
She hasn't been moving very much lately.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.158
Ugh, you should have gotten a snake.

13:20.232 --> 13:22.029
They wriggle all over the place.

13:22.401 --> 13:24.335
Do you think I should enter
more crickets into her diet?

13:24.403 --> 13:26.530
Oh, look, you're
clearly flipping out about this!

13:26.605 --> 13:28.698
I need to talk to him on his own.

13:28.774 --> 13:30.833
Is there a master bedroom we could go to?

13:31.343 --> 13:34.039
- Uh, the kitchen's right over here.
- Yeah, we could go to the kitchen.

13:34.346 --> 13:36.473
No, you stay here, mind the leg snake!

13:38.617 --> 13:40.312
<i>I could tell Trevor had a thing for me,</i>

13:40.519 --> 13:42.714
plus, I needed to tell him
what I was gonna do.

13:42.888 --> 13:44.150
Listen.

13:44.223 --> 13:48.091
Your snake's clearly gonna die
unless I do surgery on it.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.132
I don't find you attractive.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.034
You'll come 'round.

13:56.101 --> 13:57.830
- No, I won't.
- Yes, you will!

13:57.903 --> 13:59.495
Wait till you see me in the surgery!

14:03.142 --> 14:05.440
This room needs to be sterile.
You should get out.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.106
- Just me?
- Yeah, just you, Willie Nelson.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.673
- It's all right, hon.
- Quickly!

14:12.918 --> 14:14.317
Maybe I shouldn't be here either.

14:14.386 --> 14:15.444
I haven't washed my hands.

14:15.654 --> 14:16.848
Oh, neither have I.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.116
It's cool.

14:18.224 --> 14:19.350
We're hanging out.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.653
We're losing him!

14:24.630 --> 14:27.758
That snake was going to die,
so I did the only thing I could.

14:32.671 --> 14:33.763
I fixed your snake.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.007
- Lizard!
- Oh, well, actually,

14:36.075 --> 14:37.940
it's a snake now, 'cause I cut off his legs,

14:38.010 --> 14:40.342
so now he's just head, tummy, tail, snake!

I like Australian.

14:57.162 --> 14:58.220
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

14:58.297 --> 15:00.060
- That's your favorite?
- Yeah, I'm going to Australia.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.327

was when Rita Moreno was on

19:51.390 --> 19:52.755
<i>The night</i>

19:53.325 --> 19:56.021
<i>Sun lights up the morning</i>

19:56.995 --> 19:59.657
<i>Moon lights up the night</i>

20:00.566 --> 20:03.558
<i>I light up when you call my name</i>

20:03.635 --> 20:06.229
<i>'Cause you know</i>
<i>you gonna treat me right</i>

20:06.305 --> 20:07.567
<i>You give me fever</i>

20:10.108 --> 20:11.234
(MUMBLING)

20:11.577 --> 20:14.068
<i>Fevering through the night</i>

20:15.147 --> 20:16.341
<i>Fever</i>

20:17.282 --> 20:18.681
<i>How you kiss me</i>

20:18.750 --> 20:21.844
<i>Fever all through the night</i>

20:21.920 --> 20:24.821
<i>Fever all through the night</i>

20:25.757 --> 20:29.193
<i>Fever all through the night</i>

20:29.261 --> 20:32.560
<i>Fever all through the night</i>

20:32.631 --> 20:34.098
<i>Fever all...</i>

20:57.189 --> 20:58.520
She coming back?

20:58.590 --> 21:00.182
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

21:02.160 --> 21:03.525
WOMAN: <i>So easy.</i>

21:03.629 --> 21:04.755
MAN: <i>Mmm, magic.</i>

21:07.866 --> 21:09.595
You see <i>Inside Out?</i>

21:09.668 --> 21:10.794
Dude, is that the cartoon?

21:10.869 --> 21:12.894
- Dude, yes.
- So good, I cried.

21:12.971 --> 21:15.201
Cried every second of that movie.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.071
- I don't know what was up with me.
- What was the...

21:17.142 --> 21:19.406
When the dude saved himself to save her?

21:19.478 --> 21:21.139
Dude, I fucking wept.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.510
Ugh!
