WEBVTT

00:14.520 --> 00:16.760
You see this house here?

00:16.800 --> 00:18.160
There?

00:18.200 --> 00:20.600
The bloke that used to live in there,
right,

00:20.640 --> 00:23.480
kept hearing strange noises
coming out of his attic at night.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.840
And he'd go to the fridge

00:24.880 --> 00:27.000
and find that food was missing
from the fridge.

00:27.040 --> 00:30.080
So he thought, "I'm just going to go up to
the attic and check this out."

00:30.120 --> 00:32.480
And he found an entire family
of Peruvian panpipe buskers

00:32.520 --> 00:33.880
just living up there.

00:33.920 --> 00:36.120
And he thought,
"I'm just going to leave them to it,

00:36.160 --> 00:37.920
"cos they're not really
doing me any harm."

00:37.960 --> 00:40.160
And then, a few years later,
he thought,

00:40.200 --> 00:42.520
"Well, I'll just go up to the attic
to check on them.

00:42.560 --> 00:44.400
"See if they're all right."

00:44.440 --> 00:46.880
And it turned out they'd all died
of asbestos poisoning.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.080
Yeah, he doesn't live
here any more.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.560
He lives in Stroud,
cos it's closer to his work.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.400
- Loads has happened

01:04.440 --> 01:06.520
- since you've last been here.
- You missed so much.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.560
- You missed the duck race.
- The duck race.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.800
- Absolutely fucked it.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.080
Fucking hell.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.960
Kurtan's got a new girlfriend,
ain't you?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.400
Yeah, I have, actually.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.440
Called Sophie Elizabeth Huxley.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.160
But I call her Soph.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.520
Yeah, and she also lets me call her Soph
as well, doesn't she?

01:21.560 --> 01:22.800
Yeah, she does.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.600
Well, I was on Tinder for a bit.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.680
But I wasn't getting any matches, so...

01:29.720 --> 01:31.040
You didn't get one match.

01:31.080 --> 01:32.520
- Yeah.
- Not one match.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.760
That's only cos no-one
round here is on Tinder,

01:34.800 --> 01:38.520
so, you know, I had to keep setting
my radius further and further and further,

01:38.560 --> 01:40.160
then the radius got to France,

01:40.200 --> 01:42.440
and it just got silly by the end,
you know?

01:42.480 --> 01:44.840
I can't afford to be going back
and forth on the Chunnel

01:44.880 --> 01:47.400
every other weekend to take
some French frog out bowling.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.120
- No way.

01:49.160 --> 01:53.480
So, then, one evening,
I was on Facebook and it popped up,

01:53.520 --> 01:55.000
"People you might know."

01:55.040 --> 01:57.400
Yeah, so he messaged every girl on there,
saying,

01:57.440 --> 01:59.600
"Hey, what is your spirit animal?"

01:59.640 --> 02:01.080
Icebreaker.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.600
Icebreaker.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.000
And then Soph was actually
the first one to reply,

02:05.040 --> 02:07.080
saying, "Giraffe. What about you?"

02:07.120 --> 02:11.280
And I said, "Whatever animal
has sex with a giraffe."

02:11.320 --> 02:13.600
- And she found it a laugh.
- Yeah.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.120
A lot of girls don't find that a laugh,
though,

02:16.160 --> 02:17.800
especially if their spirit animal

02:17.840 --> 02:19.920
- was a hamster or their dead nan.
- Yeah.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.240
KURTAN: I just decided to sack off college
altogether in the end,

02:25.280 --> 02:28.640
especially now I got Soph.
To be honest,

02:28.680 --> 02:30.160
didn't really want to go
in the first place,

02:30.200 --> 02:32.000
but the vicar was just trying
to push me into it.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.560
Basically, just trying
to live his dream through me.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.800
Anyway, he's latched onto Kerry now,

02:36.840 --> 02:38.520
and he's leeching the life out of her.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.280
She can't see how toxic he is.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.560
So, the trick is to just
get the trowel in like that.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.000
It's been an interesting few months,
actually.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.160
I've been spending a lot more time
with Kerry,

02:47.200 --> 02:48.720
which is great.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.920
She's come on leaps and bounds,
with regard to her outlook on life.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.920
Oh, who been nicking
after them runners?

02:56.480 --> 02:58.280
They're absolutely fucked.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.120
- Sorry for saying...
- Kerry...

03:00.160 --> 03:02.960
Cos I've changed massively
since you've been here last.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.920
Cos I've reformed myself.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.280
Cos I've been hanging out
with the vicar, and that,

03:07.320 --> 03:09.160
and he's sort of taught me
the way of the world.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.800
Like, how to be kind to others

03:11.840 --> 03:14.960
and treat people
the way I always want to be treated.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.080
- This is marvellous.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.840
Some people will always
be scared of me,

03:19.880 --> 03:22.720
and I can't change that,
no matter how nice I am.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.480
But there's a balance to be had between
being nice and being feared.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.840
Like, Dr Barnardo, he was
just too nice and not feared,

03:29.880 --> 03:34.080
so he just got overrun by orphans,
and everyone just took the piss.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.280
BOTH: Yes! Yes!

03:37.320 --> 03:39.120
- VICAR: That's what I'm talking about!
- Ohh!

03:39.160 --> 03:41.640
- Just a bit less power now.
- Well, exactly.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.320
If I meet it in the middle,
then I'll get there.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.760
- VICAR: Yes.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.240
Oh, all right?

03:48.280 --> 03:50.440
- I was just playing a bit of golf.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.120
Cos it's fun.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.600
That was very good indeed.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.560
Kurtan, it's so good to see you!

04:00.680 --> 04:02.760
Erm, Vicar, Sophie. Sophie, Vicar.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.080
Hi, Sophie,
lovely to meet you at last.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.680
It's lovely to meet you, too, Vicar.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.880
- SOPHIE: Good.

04:08.920 --> 04:12.120
Yeah, pretty good. Probably the best
I've been in a long time...

04:12.160 --> 04:15.240
- Look at that! Look at that!
- That's brilliant.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.880
I'm so happy for you both.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.720
SOPHIE: Kurtan's all was going on
about you, Vicar.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.080
Is he?
- Yeah.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.400
That's not...

04:21.440 --> 04:23.120
You know, Kurtan,
you can pop in any time

04:23.160 --> 04:25.440
to see me for a cup of tea
and a catch-up.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.080
Don't really like tea.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.120
Well, just a catch up, then.

04:30.240 --> 04:32.640
Don't really like catching up.
It's not my thing.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.080
Well, I'm running Secret Cinema Club
on Thursday,

04:36.120 --> 04:38.200
if you two wanted to come.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.080
We're doing Grease. It should be fun.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.280
Oh, I love Grease.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.120
- Oh, so do I.
- That's my favourite... We'd love to.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.160
Oh, would you? That would be great.
Well, you should definitely come.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.680
- Yeah, we will.
- Yeah, fine. Whatever.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.080
- VICAR: Great!
- All right. Yeah.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.200
- So nice to meet you.
- And you, Sophie. That's great.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.400
But if you want to pop in before then,

04:54.440 --> 04:56.040
- Kurtan, you know where I am.
- Yeah.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.400
KURTAN: Sticking your nose
in everyone's business...

04:58.440 --> 05:00.160
Yeah, but he seems really nice!

05:00.200 --> 05:03.240
Yeah, cos he's a sociopath.
That's what they all want you to think.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.960
It's all just an act.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.080
KERRY: I just watched this video

05:12.120 --> 05:14.600
of this girl doing a random
act of kindness on YouTube.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.640
She basically paid for this
old man's shopping at the till.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.520
And this old man was, like,
about 90 years old.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.600
And he's so fucking old, like,
you could see through his skin.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.760
And he just starts
bawling his eyes out.

05:26.800 --> 05:30.800
He's like, "You're fucking joking me,
this ain't fucking real life."

05:30.840 --> 05:34.560
I just thought...I want to
make someone feel like that.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.520
Cos that's...I really...
That's what I want to do.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.120
What?

05:39.160 --> 05:40.560
What?!

05:44.120 --> 05:45.840
As a random act of kindness.

05:46.920 --> 05:49.400
As a random act of kindness!

06:00.080 --> 06:03.360
I don't know what she's talking about,
cos I do wipe my arse properly.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.560
OK?

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
No, listen. Right, if I turn my phone off,
right, Soph,

06:16.040 --> 06:19.160
that means I don't want to talk to anyone,
not just you.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.360
Yeah, I just want a bit
of Kurtan time.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.200
You know

06:25.640 --> 06:28.200
Oh! Yeah, OK, fine, then.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.840
Whatever.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.400
Yeah. Bye.

06:31.440 --> 06:32.840
Fucking hell.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.560
Cannot believe that.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.440
So I turned my phone off, right,
for literally, like, two days.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.720
She's going absolutely
mental about it,

06:40.760 --> 06:43.760
going, "Oh, I thought you were dead.
I was going to call the police."

06:43.800 --> 06:46.920
I'm not dead. Just can't be arsed to
text her sometimes.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.600
You know

06:50.640 --> 06:54.080
Problem is, when we first started
dating, I set the bar too high,

06:54.120 --> 06:56.120
cos I was just texting her
the whole time,

06:56.160 --> 06:58.040
but that was because I wanted
to reel her in.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.400
But now the fish is in the net,

06:59.440 --> 07:01.320
I ain't going to keep throwing
worms at it.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.080
Cos that's a waste of worms.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.080
You know, correct me if I'm wrong,

07:05.120 --> 07:07.760
but four texts a day
is complete madness.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.280
No-one can keep up with that.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.760
Not even Giffgaff.

07:15.040 --> 07:17.680
So, Slugs updated his Facebook
status this morning,

07:17.720 --> 07:21.000
saying how his PlayStation broke
and how gutted he was, and that.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.480
So I thought I'd do my very own
random act of kindness for him,

07:24.520 --> 07:29.080
because perhaps I have been quite
harsh to him in the past, you know?

07:29.120 --> 07:31.480
I mean, he's not that annoying,
it's just...

07:31.520 --> 07:34.440
He just needs to learn not
to breathe out of his mouth,

07:34.480 --> 07:37.040
cos that just winds everyone up.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.360
Hello!

07:45.400 --> 07:46.880
Oh. Erm...

07:46.920 --> 07:48.560
Sorry, is Slugs in?

07:49.760 --> 07:50.840
Michael.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.520
Me and Michael have been going out
for nearly a year.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.120
It's going well.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.480
Really well.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.240
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.640
- So, I heard your PlayStation broke.
- Yeah.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.520
- It's really sad.
- It sucks, man.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.400
Really sucks.

08:09.440 --> 08:11.880
But I've got a little surprise for you,

08:11.920 --> 08:14.560
because I know how harsh life
has been to you.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.680
Cos it has been really harsh,
you know,

08:16.720 --> 08:19.320
and you deserve happiness just as much as
the next man, don't you?

08:19.360 --> 08:21.040
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.480
Which is why, as a random
act of kindness,

08:23.520 --> 08:26.800
I am giving you my PlayStation.

08:29.520 --> 08:30.920
Thanks.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.840
Hello. You happy with that

08:46.880 --> 08:48.040
- Yeah.

08:48.080 --> 08:49.600
- Yeah, thanks.

08:49.640 --> 08:50.760
Yeah?

09:04.760 --> 09:06.200
Hello. Oh...

09:06.240 --> 09:07.880
Sorry, Slugs...

09:07.920 --> 09:10.080
Can I speak to Slugs, please?

09:10.120 --> 09:11.400
Michael?

09:28.400 --> 09:29.560
Is he coming?

09:29.600 --> 09:30.600
- Yeah.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.000
He is coming? Right. OK.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.280
Hello?

09:40.560 --> 09:42.040
Hello.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.520
Is there a problem here?

09:45.560 --> 09:46.680
With what?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.720
Well, I've just given you a PlayStation

09:48.760 --> 09:51.600
and it just doesn't feel like
you're that grateful for it.

09:51.640 --> 09:52.960
- I am.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.120
- Yeah.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.960
Because it doesn't really feel like that,
that's the thing. At all.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.400
It's a PS3.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.320
Yeah. Because... I get...

10:00.360 --> 10:03.240
That's way I've given you my PS3,
because it was broke,

10:03.280 --> 10:05.160
that's the whole point
of this whole thing.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.360
No...

10:06.400 --> 10:08.120
My PS4 is broken.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.960
My PS3 is in the garage.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.000
Oh... I just... I'll just have it back.

10:15.040 --> 10:18.280
Sorry, Kayleigh, can you just pass me
my PlayStation back?

10:18.320 --> 10:20.640
That would be absolutely great.
Thank you very much.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.160
- No, you can't keep the controllers,

10:23.200 --> 10:25.320
because, you know,
it was a whole thing...

10:25.360 --> 10:27.440
- That's the whole point in...

10:27.480 --> 10:29.240
Yeah, whatever. Fine.

10:29.280 --> 10:32.200
Just eat your toast and breathe
at the same time,

10:32.240 --> 10:34.600
like you usually do,
because that is disgusting,

10:34.640 --> 10:37.360
and, you know, you have no manners. Fine.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.320
The fact is, you did
something nice for someone.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.160
Am I doing something nice
for someone?

10:45.200 --> 10:46.520
Because it doesn't really feel like it,

10:46.560 --> 10:48.720
because I'm not getting
great feedback from it.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.240
But, Kerry, look, doing kind
gestures for people

10:51.280 --> 10:53.120
is not about getting recognition.

10:53.160 --> 10:55.360
It's about doing
kind things selflessly.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.480
- I am doing kind things selfishly.
- No - self-less-ly.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.840
What does "selflessly" mean?

11:03.880 --> 11:07.120
Well, it means you don't need
people to be grateful

11:07.160 --> 11:09.080
for the kind things you do -

11:09.120 --> 11:11.920
you do it anyway,
because it's the right thing to do.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.960
Right...

11:17.000 --> 11:21.120
So, like, when you're at Tesco's
and using the self-service checkouts,

11:21.160 --> 11:23.240
and the machine gives
you your change,

11:23.280 --> 11:25.400
and it says,
"Please take your change,"

11:25.440 --> 11:26.800
and you say, "Thank you,"

11:26.840 --> 11:30.200
and you know it can't hear you
say thank you, cos it's a robot,

11:30.240 --> 11:33.640
but you say thank you anyway,
because it's the nice thing to do...

11:35.160 --> 11:36.640
Um... Yes, well, sort of.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.400
- Yeah.
- Yep.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.000
I get it. I get it,
I get it, I get it, I get it.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.840
Cheers, thanks for that, Vics.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.040
- No problem.
- Thank you.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.240
Thank you, Kerry, bye.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.400
That will be £4, please. There we go.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.480
KERRY: Talking to the vicar really helped,

12:04.520 --> 12:07.360
so, I decided,
as a random act of kindness,

12:07.400 --> 12:10.880
I'm going to do security
for him at his Grease cinema night.

12:13.320 --> 12:14.720
OK. You're all good.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.360
If you'd like to go on through,
just up and on the right, OK?

12:17.400 --> 12:19.920
- Checking for knives and shit.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.680
I really don't think
that's necessary.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.640
It is, if my enemies know I'm here.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.560
I was at midnight Mass one year,
right,

12:25.600 --> 12:26.920
someone got tipped off I was there.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.200
As I was coming out the church,

12:28.240 --> 12:30.400
someone tries to shoot
me with a crossbow.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.160
OK, Kerry. Right.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.000
- Oh, another thing.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.040
Just to let you know,

12:40.080 --> 12:42.040
I changed all the light bulbs
in the toilet to UV,

12:42.080 --> 12:44.440
so if we get any smack-heads
tonight,

12:44.480 --> 12:47.480
they won't be able to see their veins
when they're shooting up.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.040
Super. Right, um...

12:49.080 --> 12:51.720
Just... Sorry about that.
Just the one ticket?

12:51.760 --> 12:53.360
All right?

12:55.200 --> 12:57.200
Why are you not dressed up?

12:57.240 --> 12:59.000
- I thought you were joking.
- No.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.120
That's the whole point
of Grease cinema night -

13:01.160 --> 13:03.120
you dress up as, like,
the people from the film.

13:03.160 --> 13:04.720
Well, I haven't seen the film, have I?

13:04.760 --> 13:06.720
That's why I came here -
to watch the fucking film

13:06.760 --> 13:09.240
- like a normal human being.
- All right! Just go inside, then.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.640
Come on.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.160
KURTAN: Oh, my God. Is that Slugs?

13:17.200 --> 13:20.120
- She looks great.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.360
KURTAN: She can't walk in those shoes!
Fucking 'ell.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.560
- Bambi on ice.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.840
- Hey, guys.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.160
Doing good.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.080
- Yeah.

14:04.440 --> 14:06.200
- Am I glad to see you!

14:06.240 --> 14:07.280
Why?

14:07.320 --> 14:08.760
This

14:08.800 --> 14:10.800
- This whole...

14:10.840 --> 14:12.400
It's embarrassing.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.400
- Yeah.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.280
KERRY: Don't know what party you're at,
this one's banging, mate.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.840
Look at everyone, look at them.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.440
- You ain't dressed up.
- You ain't dressed up.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.480
Yeah, I am. I'm security.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.760
You look like Andy Fordham.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.400
Who's that?

14:27.440 --> 14:29.320
Fat darts player, basically.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.280
Well, I don't care,
cos I'm enjoying myself.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.240
I do miss spending time
with Kurtan, actually.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.440
I suppose that's a bit selfish of me,
really,

14:39.480 --> 14:42.400
cos he's got his own life to live, but...

14:42.440 --> 14:47.080
..you know, it's just so good
to see him so happy with Sophie.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.280
I don't even know
why you're getting so upset.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.640
I di...

15:07.640 --> 15:11.000
I've made an effort by coming here
tonight. I didn't want to come.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.680
Do you understand that?
But I still did.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.480
- You don't give a shit about me.
- Oh...

15:15.520 --> 15:18.480
I make such an effort,
and now you don't give a shit.

15:18.520 --> 15:21.600
When I look at Slugs and Kayleigh,
I think that's all that I want.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.000
That is insane.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.600
It's not. He was dancing,
he was making an effort.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.960
- Yeah, like a fucking Boohbah.
- And you still haven't let me know

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
if you're coming to my parents'
barbecue on Sunday.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.840
- Oh...
- I've asked you, like, three times...

15:32.880 --> 15:35.200
Hey, hey, hey!
This is Mr Belding.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.760
What have I told you kids
about loitering in the corridors?

15:37.800 --> 15:39.840
Sorry, mate, who are you?

15:39.880 --> 15:41.200
Ian.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.680
Ian, right, I'm just having
a very serious chat

15:43.720 --> 15:45.400
with my girlfriend right here,

15:45.440 --> 15:48.360
and what you've just done is really
inappropriate, mate, all right?

15:48.400 --> 15:50.280
- Sorry, mate.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.080
Fuck!

15:53.640 --> 15:55.200
Do you not wanna be with me?

15:57.400 --> 16:01.240
Mr Belding, that... That's
Saved By The Bell, that's not Grease.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.120
He's got that totally wrong.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.240
Sorry...

16:06.280 --> 16:07.400
What did you say?

16:08.560 --> 16:10.120
Fucking prick.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.480
Oh, fuck.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.160
Mr Belding!

16:25.200 --> 16:27.080
Pfft.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.080
He's... He's gonna be embarrassed
about that in the morning.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.000
Sophie dumped Kurtan last night,
so he's in a bit of a state.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.520
I had to wheel him here
from his house in an Asda trolley,

16:45.560 --> 16:48.320
cos he was just too
heartbroken to move.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.440
It's a shame, cos I'd just finished
writing my best man speech.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.840
But...

16:58.960 --> 17:00.640
"When I first saw Sophie

17:00.680 --> 17:03.800
"I thought, 'Wow, Kurtan's really
punching above his weight.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.360
" 'He'll never be able
to hang on to her!'

17:06.400 --> 17:09.400
"But he has,
and I've never seen him happier."

17:30.640 --> 17:31.640
You all right?

17:34.200 --> 17:35.480
Kurtan?

17:37.880 --> 17:39.120
Kurtan, mate?

17:39.160 --> 17:40.440
Yeah, I...

17:40.480 --> 17:43.040
Oh, I just need to sort my shit out.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.000
And try and fix things.

17:50.680 --> 17:53.120
KERRY: Yeah, it is hard seeing
Kurtan like this,

17:53.160 --> 17:56.120
but when someone's down,
there's nothing better

17:56.160 --> 17:57.840
than a little random
act of kindness,

17:57.880 --> 18:00.200
and I know exactly
how to fix things.

18:05.120 --> 18:09.040
Sometimes you don't know what you got
until you ain't got it any more.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.680
Like Blockbuster's.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.560
I just took 'em for granted -
and then, one day, gone,

18:17.600 --> 18:20.520
and you spend ages trying to figure out
what went wrong,

18:20.560 --> 18:24.320
and then you realise
it was your fault all along.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.680
It's all right, Kurtan.

18:25.720 --> 18:29.520
Not Blockbuster's,
that...that was online piracy,

18:29.560 --> 18:33.160
and lack of vision upstairs,
in the boardroom.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.840
It's just...like...

18:34.880 --> 18:38.880
..after not going to
Swindon College and that...

18:40.360 --> 18:44.240
...when I ducked out, I just thought
that I'd let you down.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.320
Of course you didn't.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.800
Is...

18:50.840 --> 18:53.640
Is that why you've not
been coming to see me?

18:53.680 --> 18:55.320
- Yeah.
- Oh, Kurtan.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.600
Well, that and...

19:01.320 --> 19:05.800
...the cress that we sowed together
in the village hall kitchen,

19:05.840 --> 19:08.560
I've actually been having
nightmares about it,

19:08.600 --> 19:10.640
because I haven't watered it in so long,

19:10.680 --> 19:13.520
and in my dreams,
the cress is so thirsty,

19:13.560 --> 19:16.640
it's dying like a starving dog,
and it's just going,

19:16.680 --> 19:18.560
"Kurtan just left me to die."

19:18.600 --> 19:21.480
Kurtan, don't... Don't worry, it's fine.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.760
I've been watering it.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.360
- Yes.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.800
- Yes.

19:25.840 --> 19:26.840
Oh...

19:28.240 --> 19:29.600
That's...

19:29.640 --> 19:31.200
That's amazing.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.480
I'm sorry you've been worrying so much
about it.

19:34.520 --> 19:35.880
- I really am.
- I have.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.160
It's just so stupid.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.520
- I just know it's so stupid...
- Oh, you mustn't feel stupid.

19:40.560 --> 19:42.840
I wish you'd come and told me
all this earlier.

19:44.360 --> 19:49.040
Yeah, just had a great chat
with the vicar and, honestly,

19:49.080 --> 19:52.040
I feel so much better now
everything's sorted.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.480
I feel bad for slagging him off,
because that was bang out of order...

19:57.560 --> 20:01.160
...and for posting a picture of him
on that German porn site, but...

20:01.200 --> 20:03.320
I can probably take that down, I think.

20:04.440 --> 20:07.120
I feel like a prat about the cress,
as well, but...

20:07.160 --> 20:09.320
You don't need to feel
silly about that.

20:09.360 --> 20:11.360
You don't believe how much I stress...

20:11.400 --> 20:13.440
I've been stressing
about it so much.

20:13.480 --> 20:18.520
Yes, it's great having Kurtan back,
I've really missed him. Um...

20:19.680 --> 20:24.040
...but just between you and me,
his cress...  ...did die, um,

20:24.080 --> 20:27.640
but I don't think he's quite
ready to hear that just yet.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.160
I just think I was in denial about
a lot of shit, even Soph,

20:40.200 --> 20:43.960
and I was taking it out on the vicar,
even though it weren't his fault.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.280
Thinking about it now, me and Soph
just weren't right for each other.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.960
I'm just going round Kerry's house.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.120
She really wants me to come over.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.720
Yeah, probably be nice to hang out
with her again, just us two.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.680
Like the old days, really.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.040
- SOPHIE: Hi.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.600
What are you...doing here?

21:07.640 --> 21:10.320
- Well, Ker called me...
- I called her.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.640
Oh, right.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.120
OK.

21:14.160 --> 21:17.640
So, do you wanna talk? Cos this is just...
This is so silly.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.640
- KERRY: It is so silly.
- Yeah, it's just...

21:20.680 --> 21:23.040
It is what it is, though, really.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.280
So...

21:24.320 --> 21:26.480
Do you wanna go outside?

21:26.520 --> 21:28.800
- Give her a kiss!

21:30.000 --> 21:31.280
What for?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.760
I thought you said you wanted
to fix things.

21:34.800 --> 21:38.720
- I...don't...remember saying that.
- You did.

21:38.760 --> 21:41.200
You told me you wanted to fix things.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.560
He did.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.320
I did, yeah, but...

21:44.360 --> 21:46.640
...with...with the vicar.

21:54.920 --> 21:59.040
So, you definitely don't wanna
fix things with...her?

21:59.080 --> 22:00.600
Nah.

22:00.640 --> 22:01.840
Sorry.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.200
Um...

22:05.920 --> 22:07.080
Yeah.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.520
Probably should go now.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.080
OK, see ya.

22:14.120 --> 22:16.280
Sorry, can I just get round you?

22:16.320 --> 22:17.760
Thanks.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.800
I'm so sorry...

22:33.920 --> 22:35.280
...but...

22:35.320 --> 22:37.560
...is it all right if you leave my house?

22:39.000 --> 22:42.440
It's just I only kind of know you
through Kurtan.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.520
Is that OK?

22:46.560 --> 22:47.960
Yeah?

22:48.000 --> 22:49.560
So sorry about that.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.040
Ooh...

22:58.080 --> 23:00.520
- See ya.
- Bye.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.160
I'm not quite sure what...

23:12.680 --> 23:15.800
Cos I must have read that
completely wrong there.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.800
It's her own fault, actually,

23:21.840 --> 23:24.000
cos she led me down this path.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.960
You know?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.280
I...

23:29.920 --> 23:32.840
She was sort of doing it to me,
that's the thing.

23:32.880 --> 23:36.640
She was going to me, "Oh," you know,
"you get us back together."

23:36.680 --> 23:38.640
It is not really my fault, is it?

23:40.000 --> 23:42.520
I think she's just
living in a dream world.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.440
She wanted it to go that way,

23:44.480 --> 23:46.680
and it just wasn't gonna
go that way.

23:46.720 --> 23:50.080
She even got me thinking
that they'd get back together...

23:51.160 --> 23:55.240
..but that's manipula....
manipulative people...do that.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.200
And he's better off without her.

24:01.360 --> 24:02.960
- VICAR: Yeah.

24:04.680 --> 24:07.440
- Kurtan, not bad. Bit more power.
- Yeah.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.440
Your go, Kerry.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.920
- KURTAN: Rubbish.
- Er, Kurtan, please.

24:11.960 --> 24:14.960
That wasn't rubbish,
that was a good effort.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.400
Ah, see?

24:18.440 --> 24:21.240
- That wasn't much to write home about.

24:21.280 --> 24:23.640
- She just kicked it!
- No, I didn't.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.400
- Kerry...
- I saw you kick it!

24:25.440 --> 24:27.120
- Just a minute. Kerry...
- You can't kick...!

24:27.160 --> 24:28.480
Kerry, don't be silly, look.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.200
- Play fair, or you can sit out.
- No, honestly, cos...

24:30.240 --> 24:32.160
- Come on.
- KURTAN: Don't...

24:32.200 --> 24:33.440
I'll just tell him about the cress, then,
shall I?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.160
Kerry, please.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.200
What about the cress?

24:40.240 --> 24:42.040
Nothing, Kurtan. It's fine.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.440
- I'm just gonna take this shot.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.600
It's fucking dead, isn't it?
