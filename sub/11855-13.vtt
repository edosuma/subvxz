WEBVTT

00:11.375 --> 00:12.583
Higher, Mom! Higher!

00:12.667 --> 00:13.834
(man)
'Give it up.
Give me
that.'

00:13.917 --> 00:15.166
'What you got?
What you got?'

00:15.250 --> 00:17.375
You ready for me, right?
You ready for me?

00:17.917 --> 00:18.917
Uh-oh.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.417
Alright.
Alright.

00:21.917 --> 00:24.458
'Boom!
Give me that!'

00:24.542 --> 00:26.000
(man #1)
Oh, give me
that.

00:28.792 --> 00:29.917
You ready for it?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.333
Where I'm going?
Where I'm going?

00:31.417 --> 00:32.500
Come on, now.

00:34.709 --> 00:36.709
Ain't said nothing.

00:36.792 --> 00:37.750
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

00:37.834 --> 00:39.291
(girl)
Do an "underdog," Mom.

00:39.375 --> 00:41.917
Alright, Miss Fish.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.166
One underdog coming up.

00:45.375 --> 00:48.208
(man #1)
Ah, nothing but
net.

01:03.625 --> 01:05.291
(woman #1)
No!

01:05.375 --> 01:08.333
Kayla!

01:08.417 --> 01:10.417
Baby, wake up.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.583
Wake up for mommy.

01:12.667 --> 01:15.834
[sobbing]
Please.

01:15.917 --> 01:17.291
'Kayla!'

02:09.917 --> 02:10.875
Nick.

02:10.959 --> 02:12.917
Record lows
out there,
Scotty.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.208
Yeah.

02:14.291 --> 02:16.417
Hey, Lil.

02:18.041 --> 02:19.875
Kind of chilly
in here, too.

02:19.959 --> 02:21.000
I, um..

02:21.083 --> 02:23.417
...hear you went to
Christina's bar.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.750
- Yeah? From who?
- From her.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.166
Me and Nicky went
for a couple beers.

02:31.250 --> 02:34.166
Not like we knew
she was working there.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.375
Ain't that right?

02:35.458 --> 02:37.583
Gospel.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.458
Uh-huh.

02:40.959 --> 02:42.667
I ain't interested
in your sister, Lil.

02:42.750 --> 02:43.625
Good.

02:43.709 --> 02:45.041
'Cause she's a train wreck.

02:45.125 --> 02:46.208
Okay.

02:49.792 --> 02:52.625
- And she didn't hit on you--
- No.

02:54.333 --> 02:56.166
You know the mayor's
gun recovery program?

02:56.250 --> 02:58.417
Turn in a weapon,
get a pair of sneakers?

02:58.500 --> 02:59.500
This kid
from Strawberry Mansion

02:59.583 --> 03:00.667
turned that in
a month ago

03:00.750 --> 03:02.500
'for a pair of
"Allen Iversons".'

03:02.583 --> 03:04.166
And FIU finally
got around to it?

03:04.250 --> 03:05.959
Turns out the gun's
got a body on it.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.583
Drive-by shooting, 1987.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.792
- The job ever come in?
- Unsolved.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.458
Victim was a six-year-old girl.

03:11.542 --> 03:12.917
And this is what killed her?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.583
Rifling matched a projectile
found at the scene.

03:15.667 --> 03:16.917
This is Jason James

03:17.000 --> 03:19.083
and his
son,
Jason Jr.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.417
Stupid here's
the one who took

03:20.500 --> 03:22.083
my gun without permission,
turned it in.

03:22.166 --> 03:23.458
How was I supposed
to know it was hot?

03:23.542 --> 03:25.000
Sayin' I did?

03:25.083 --> 03:26.917
Mr. James, how long did you
own this gun?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.625
Five years.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.166
Bought it at a gun show...
Bare Arms Bonanza.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.125
- You got proof of that?
- Nah.

03:33.208 --> 03:34.792
But I remember the guy
I bought it from.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.041
"Uncle Sam" Murray.

03:36.125 --> 03:37.500
'Wears the crazy hat
and everything.'

03:37.583 --> 03:39.458
Gun's got a history, Mr. James.

03:39.542 --> 03:41.792
It killed a little girl.

03:44.834 --> 03:46.291
So maybe it was
a good thing I turned it in?

03:46.375 --> 03:47.625
Take off those shoes.

03:47.709 --> 03:49.458
- Dad, it's snowing outside.
- Get 'em off!

03:49.542 --> 03:52.291
You ain't profiting
off of someone getting
killed.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.625
How much you pay for this,
back in 2000?

03:56.709 --> 03:58.250
89 bucks.

03:58.333 --> 04:00.125
That's cheap.

04:00.208 --> 04:01.792
Well, it was used.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.709
(Valens)
Drive-by
at Langston Hughes Park.

04:37.792 --> 04:40.500
(Stillman)
Theory at the time was
a drug war over turf.

04:40.583 --> 04:42.583
Kayla Odoms was hit
when a bullet ricocheted

04:42.667 --> 04:43.917
off the basketball pole.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.583
Yeah, got her
in the chest.

04:45.667 --> 04:46.917
'Cops in '87 figured
the real target'

04:47.000 --> 04:49.333
was one of the players
or onlookers.

04:49.417 --> 04:51.208
Two of the spectators
were ex-cons.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.917
One was a known drug dealer.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.917
Six others with petty records
at the scene.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.709
That's a big
suspect pool.

04:56.792 --> 04:59.125
A 911 caller,
Rodney Johnson

04:59.208 --> 05:02.166
calls it in from a pay-phone
three blocks away.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.625
Three blocks?

05:03.709 --> 05:05.250
Cell phones were
science fiction

05:05.333 --> 05:06.375
in '87, Scotty.

05:06.458 --> 05:07.667
Got anything on the car?

05:07.750 --> 05:09.959
Beige, two-door sedan.

05:10.041 --> 05:11.333
No I.D. on the make
or plates.

05:11.417 --> 05:12.458
(Stillman)
'I'll send Vera
and Jeffries'

05:12.542 --> 05:13.625
to talk to the family.

05:13.709 --> 05:14.792
We'll go see
the gun dealer

05:14.875 --> 05:16.125
who sold the MAC
to Jason James.

05:16.208 --> 05:19.542
Yeah, this, uh,
Uncle Sam character.

05:19.625 --> 05:21.375
What do you guess the
"time to crime" was

05:21.458 --> 05:22.417
on this weapon?

05:22.500 --> 05:23.542
Less than a week?

05:23.625 --> 05:25.583
What, for a Mac 10?

05:25.667 --> 05:27.166
I bet someone bought
that bad boy

05:27.250 --> 05:29.417
and used it in a crime
that very day.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.000
We lost Kayla 18 years ago.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.125
Why we got to relive it now?

05:38.208 --> 05:40.291
Mom, they got a good lead
with this gun.

05:40.375 --> 05:41.917
Let's start with
you, Mr. Odoms.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.917
Where were you
when Kayla got shot?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.500
I was driving
a cab till 1:30.

05:47.583 --> 05:48.875
And you Darnell?

05:48.959 --> 05:50.667
Home watching TV.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.667
The man you see here...
he was just a pup

05:52.750 --> 05:53.667
back then.

05:53.750 --> 05:54.875
Turned 12 that day.

05:54.959 --> 05:57.083
Kayla was killed
on your birthday?

05:57.166 --> 06:00.166
Do you know
she'd be 24 now?

06:00.250 --> 06:03.583
Can you remember who was at the
park that night, Mrs. Odoms?

06:03.667 --> 06:07.000
I just remember Kayla talking
a blue streak on those swings.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.083
Mm, that girl,
she could talk.

06:09.166 --> 06:13.458
So I wasn't paying much
attention to anyone else.

06:13.542 --> 06:16.083
Till after..

06:16.166 --> 06:17.917
You think Darnell
liked the fishes I got him?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.333
I know he did.

06:19.417 --> 06:21.667
You don't think he
minded
I named them for him?

06:21.750 --> 06:22.792
He can change them
if he wants to.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.041
No, he can't.

06:24.125 --> 06:26.333
Guaramis got to be called
Kissy-face

06:26.417 --> 06:28.375
'cause the way
their mouths go.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.959
You know what Darnell
wants to be when he grows up?

06:31.041 --> 06:33.125
- What?
- An ichthyologist.

06:33.208 --> 06:34.291
Ichthyologist?

06:34.375 --> 06:36.291
Yeah, fish doctor.

06:36.375 --> 06:37.709
Where do you get
these words?

06:37.792 --> 06:39.291
From Darnell.
He's real smart.

06:39.375 --> 06:40.917
(man #1)
'This show ain't
over yet, B.'

06:41.000 --> 06:43.333
- We're just getting
started.
- 'Higher, Mom, higher!'

06:44.125 --> 06:45.333
Do an "underdog," Mom.

06:45.417 --> 06:47.542
Alright, Miss Fish.

06:47.625 --> 06:49.834
One underdog coming up.

07:02.709 --> 07:04.083
No!

07:04.166 --> 07:06.834
Kayla!

07:11.417 --> 07:12.875
'Baby, wake up.'

07:12.959 --> 07:14.417
Oh, my God.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.041
Don't touch me!

07:16.125 --> 07:17.667
[weeping]
Don't nobody touch me.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.208
Hey, someone call
an ambulance.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.166
(man)
Ain't no phones
working around here.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.291
Besides, ain't
no use anyway.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.333
Girl's dead.

07:23.417 --> 07:25.166
She's not dead.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.166
She's gonna wake up.

07:26.250 --> 07:27.208
I'll find a phone, alright.

07:27.291 --> 07:28.458
Just don't worry.

07:32.417 --> 07:33.834
Please.

07:33.917 --> 07:36.458
Kayla!

07:36.542 --> 07:39.000
I didn't let her out of my
arms
till the paramedics got there

07:39.083 --> 07:42.709
30 minutes later.

07:42.792 --> 07:44.333
What were you doing
at the park

07:44.417 --> 07:45.709
at 10:00 p.m.?

07:45.792 --> 07:47.000
It was stifling
that night.

07:47.083 --> 07:49.375
Me and Kayla
couldn't
sleep.

07:49.458 --> 07:50.834
We went out
for a walk.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.625
If we'd just stayed home,
Kayla would be alive.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.208
You couldn't have known what
was going to happen that
night.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.500
'I've been telling her that'

07:59.583 --> 08:00.792
for 18 years.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.083
We both have.

08:03.166 --> 08:05.250
Don't matter.

08:05.333 --> 08:07.583
It's still my fault.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.917
And always will be.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.250
Well, here's
a handsome couple.

08:27.333 --> 08:28.750
Uncle Sam Murray?

08:28.834 --> 08:29.750
Let me guess.

08:29.834 --> 08:31.083
Firearm for the missus.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.375
Strictly self-defense.

08:32.458 --> 08:33.750
Am I right?

08:33.834 --> 08:36.583
You sold a MAC-10 to a man
named Jason James

08:36.667 --> 08:37.875
'five years ago?'

08:37.959 --> 08:39.583
I've been selling
quality firearms

08:39.667 --> 08:41.250
for close to 20 years.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.625
Can't expect me
to remember one sale.

08:43.709 --> 08:46.125
That's why we brought this.

08:46.208 --> 08:48.583
You recognize him?

08:48.667 --> 08:50.333
He do something wrong?

08:50.417 --> 08:52.083
Gun did
something wrong.

08:52.166 --> 08:53.583
Little girl was
killed with it.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.709
Hey, that ain't my fault.

08:55.792 --> 08:57.083
I'm a dealer,
I don't got to

08:57.166 --> 08:58.166
do background checks--

08:58.250 --> 08:59.583
Where'd you get the gun?

08:59.667 --> 09:01.917
You sayin' I had something to
do
with a shooting?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.417
Maybe, if you owned it in '87.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.750
That is a wild accusation.

09:06.834 --> 09:08.625
I resent it, I abhor it

09:08.709 --> 09:10.625
- I deny it.
- Hey, Uncle Sam, listen up.

09:10.709 --> 09:11.917
You had the gun in 2000.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.333
We've got to
trace it to '87.

09:13.417 --> 09:16.041
So where and when did
you get the MAC-10?

09:17.500 --> 09:20.000
I got it in '99.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.625
Keep going.

09:22.709 --> 09:23.959
I was visiting my dad

09:24.041 --> 09:26.709
at the Delaware Downs
Housing Projects.

09:28.041 --> 09:30.166
- You missed, fool.
- Missed, my ass.

09:30.250 --> 09:32.291
'I busted a cap in you,
missed my ass.'

09:36.583 --> 09:38.959
Don't shoot, players.
I'm unarmed.

09:39.041 --> 09:41.291
You with the Housing
Authority, mister?

09:41.375 --> 09:43.125
Can't say that I am.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.500
Well you ain't
no gangster, so..

09:45.583 --> 09:47.208
Put that thing down, son.

09:47.792 --> 09:49.166
Now!

09:58.917 --> 10:03.834
Are you crazy, boy?
This is a real gun.

10:03.917 --> 10:06.000
Ain't no bullets in it.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.375
What do you call those?

10:10.458 --> 10:11.750
Where the hell
did you get this?

10:11.834 --> 10:14.000
- I ain't telling.
- Give it back!

10:14.083 --> 10:16.458
You're lucky
to be alive, you know that?

10:16.542 --> 10:17.834
Now get!

10:17.917 --> 10:20.625
Before I really bust a cap
in your scrawny asses.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.375
Those boys came
this close

10:27.458 --> 10:28.709
to meeting their maker.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.542
This close.

10:30.625 --> 10:31.959
You didn't tell
their parents?

10:32.041 --> 10:33.208
No.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.083
Kids ran in the apartment
across the hall

10:35.166 --> 10:37.417
and slammed the door.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.750
Slammed it, huh?

10:38.834 --> 10:39.834
(Rush)
'So you just..'

10:39.917 --> 10:41.792
...walked on
out of there?

10:41.875 --> 10:44.583
Those kids were lucky
I showed up when I did.

10:44.667 --> 10:45.917
Oh, lucky for you, too.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.291
Free gun and all.

10:47.375 --> 10:48.959
Hey, I saved their lives.

10:49.041 --> 10:51.000
And made 89 bucks
to boot.

10:55.083 --> 10:56.542
(Kayla on tape)
'They're Guaramis.'

10:56.625 --> 10:58.458
You don't
have them yet.

10:58.542 --> 11:00.333
(Darnell)
'I know. Thanks.'

11:00.417 --> 11:02.041
(Kayla)
Dad helped me
pick them out.

11:02.125 --> 11:03.834
(Mike)
'Are they gonna be alright
in this heat?'

11:03.917 --> 11:05.542
For a while, sure.

11:05.625 --> 11:06.709
(Kayla)
'If they're not'

11:06.792 --> 11:08.041
Darnell can fix 'em.

11:08.125 --> 11:10.583
He's gonna be
a fish doctor.

11:17.166 --> 11:18.709
There was something going down.

11:18.792 --> 11:20.125
Now we gotta enhance this.

11:20.208 --> 11:22.125
Huh. The Philly PD way.

11:22.208 --> 11:23.417
You know, any other city

11:23.500 --> 11:25.750
they'd have one of
them zoomer sticks.

11:25.834 --> 11:29.083
Ah, quit griping. Your
eyes
are better than mine.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.375
'See the guy in red shorts?'

11:30.458 --> 11:32.667
- Yeah.
- Cedric Browning.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.667
I arrested him
a couple years ago.

11:34.750 --> 11:36.083
Maybe this
hustle
heated up

11:36.166 --> 11:38.917
a little bit
later that
night?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.417
(Rush)
"Girls Gone Wild?"

11:41.917 --> 11:44.417
Videotape the, uh,
Odoms family made

11:44.500 --> 11:45.875
day of the murder.

11:45.959 --> 11:48.417
- It was the brother's
birthday.
- You get anything?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.542
(Vera)
'Well, there's some kind of
scuffle going on here.'

11:50.625 --> 11:51.917
(Jeffries)
'Yeah, well,
check it out.'

11:52.000 --> 11:53.625
Might be connected
to the shooting.

11:53.709 --> 11:55.792
Oh, boss hit a
snafu with the
gun.

11:55.875 --> 11:57.333
What's that?

11:57.417 --> 11:59.125
Well, the serial number showed
it was manufactured

11:59.208 --> 12:01.041
at Barkin Industries.
They have a record of it

12:01.125 --> 12:03.458
leaving the factory
in August '87.

12:03.542 --> 12:04.458
Bound for where?

12:04.542 --> 12:05.750
The Second Amendment.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.125
The gun shop in West Philly.

12:07.208 --> 12:08.625
So what do
their
records say?

12:08.709 --> 12:11.000
That's just it. Second
Amendment
says they never received

12:11.083 --> 12:13.291
the crate of guns
that included our Mac 10.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.125
So that baby was
born,
left the hospital

12:15.208 --> 12:16.709
'and never
made it home.'

12:16.792 --> 12:18.959
Well, maybe it was delivered
to the wrong store?

12:19.041 --> 12:21.542
Or maybe someone kidnapped it.

12:26.417 --> 12:28.000
The owner
of Barkin Industries says

12:28.083 --> 12:29.458
you can sift
through his records.

12:29.542 --> 12:31.917
- No warrant necessary.
- What a guy.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.667
Now we got to find out
where that gun went,
Nick.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.250
If it was delivered
to the wrong store.

12:35.333 --> 12:37.750
Or if it was stolen
before it got to one.

12:37.834 --> 12:39.875
(Valens)
Sounds like fun.
Wish we can help, but..

12:39.959 --> 12:41.917
- We're on the street, boss.
- Delaware Downs?

12:42.000 --> 12:43.166
Uncle Sam said these kids

12:43.250 --> 12:45.083
with the MAC
ran back into an apartment

12:45.166 --> 12:46.417
catty-corner to his dad's.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.166
Well, hopefully,
the buck stops there.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.750
Well, one gun can pass through
a
lot of hands in 18 years.

12:50.834 --> 12:53.250
All we need to know is
who was holding it in '87.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.291
Hey.

12:59.917 --> 13:02.375
So, Christina
didn't come on to
you?

13:02.458 --> 13:03.333
Nah.

13:03.417 --> 13:04.709
Not how I saw it.

13:04.792 --> 13:05.834
(Valens)
'Well, you left, man.'

13:05.917 --> 13:07.291
You didn't see anything.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.333
- You got to call it off.
- Don't worry about it.

13:09.417 --> 13:13.208
Serious. It's what you call
ill-advised.

13:13.291 --> 13:15.000
Hey, I'm on it, okay?

13:38.583 --> 13:39.875
Yes?

13:39.959 --> 13:41.333
Philly Homicide, ma'am.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.583
We're tracking
a murder weapon.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.625
It was last seen in
this apartment in
'99.

13:49.709 --> 13:50.709
'99, you say?

13:50.792 --> 13:52.041
I was here in '99.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.417
Hell, I was here '89.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.041
Feel like I been here
since '09.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.417
Man saw two boys

13:57.500 --> 13:58.917
out in the stairwell

13:59.000 --> 13:59.959
playing with a gun.

14:00.041 --> 14:00.917
'MAC-10.'

14:01.000 --> 14:02.083
Then they ran
into your place.

14:02.166 --> 14:04.792
- Well, that
figures.
- Ma'am?

14:04.875 --> 14:07.750
Those boys are my grandsons.

14:07.834 --> 14:09.041
Where'd they get the gun?

14:09.125 --> 14:10.750
Where I kept it...
under a floorboard.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.125
Thinking they'd never find it.

14:12.208 --> 14:14.125
So, that gun was yours?

14:14.208 --> 14:15.125
Not exactly.

14:15.208 --> 14:16.417
I stole it.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.000
Mind telling us from who?

14:18.083 --> 14:19.583
I gonna catch trouble?

14:19.667 --> 14:21.500
Nah.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.083
From the family
I was working for.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.959
This was, what, back in '93?

14:28.583 --> 14:30.208
(young guy)
'Truly..'

14:30.291 --> 14:33.208
...could I have a word, please?

14:39.917 --> 14:43.417
Would you shut the door, please?

14:45.875 --> 14:48.041
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

14:48.125 --> 14:49.750
I don't think so, Eric.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.166
I think there is.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.458
I think you found something
under my mattress.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.250
No.

14:57.542 --> 15:00.083
- You're lying.
- I got vacuuming to do.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.417
You're the only one
who comes in here.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.625
I know you took it.

15:03.709 --> 15:05.375
- Now, give it back.
- Or what?

15:05.458 --> 15:07.125
Give it back to me, Truly,
or I swear to God..

15:07.208 --> 15:08.667
I seen those pictures
you draw.

15:08.750 --> 15:11.041
List of all those
people
with skulls by their
name.

15:11.125 --> 15:12.625
Ever hear of
of the word privacy?

15:12.709 --> 15:14.333
I ain't gonna let you
shoot up yourself

15:14.417 --> 15:16.667
this house, or anyone else,
for that matter.

15:16.750 --> 15:20.500
Then I'll just get another
gun
and hunt you down with it.

15:20.583 --> 15:23.208
You can try, Eric.

15:23.291 --> 15:26.583
Just remember, you ain't
the only one gonna be armed.

15:31.875 --> 15:34.083
I took that kid's gun
for his own good.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.750
Then my grandkids
nearly got killed with it.

15:36.834 --> 15:39.125
Any idea where Eric got hold
of that MAC-10?

15:39.208 --> 15:41.625
Nope. Never had a chance
to find out, neither.

15:41.709 --> 15:44.291
Got fired the next day.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.333
No good deed goes unpunished.

15:46.417 --> 15:49.500
Sounds like you might've
saved some lives there, Truly.

15:49.583 --> 15:52.208
Maybe, maybe not.
Who's to say?

15:56.083 --> 15:57.542
Just finished retooling.

15:57.625 --> 16:00.083
On account of the assault
weapons ban being lifted.

16:00.166 --> 16:03.041
About time they stopped
meddling
with the second amendment.

16:03.125 --> 16:04.917
You sell many MACs
back in '87?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.208
MACs were the weapon
of choice

16:06.291 --> 16:09.458
among certain...
populations back then.

16:09.542 --> 16:10.709
You got the invoices?

16:10.792 --> 16:12.417
Which stores
the guns were shipped to?

16:12.500 --> 16:15.208
All our records post-'92
are computerized.

16:15.291 --> 16:19.375
Pre-'92, however, is, uh,
is a different story.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.375
That's unfortunate.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.375
If a case of my MACs
was delivered

16:23.458 --> 16:27.709
to the wrong store by
accident,
I'm not liable, right?

16:27.792 --> 16:29.667
We're just looking
for the shooter, Mr. Barkin.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.709
Yeah, unless you pulled
a drive-by in '87

16:31.792 --> 16:32.834
you got nothing to worry about.

16:32.917 --> 16:35.458
[chuckling]
Good, good.

16:35.542 --> 16:36.750
I just make them.

16:36.834 --> 16:39.417
Can't control who buys them.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.125
Take all the time you need.

16:44.083 --> 16:46.000
Nice guy.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.375
Eric Morrison?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.750
Yeah, I'm Eric.
Did I do something?

16:58.834 --> 17:01.208
You remember a woman
used to work for your family?

17:01.291 --> 17:03.291
- Truly Sinclair?
- Yeah, sure. Why?

17:03.375 --> 17:06.667
Well, she says she took a gun
from you in 1993.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.250
- Yeah.
- MAC-10?

17:09.333 --> 17:10.166
Yeah.

17:10.250 --> 17:11.417
How long did you own it?

17:11.500 --> 17:12.917
Six, seven months.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.083
Why? Is Truly in trouble?

17:14.166 --> 17:16.458
'Cause she kind of
saved my life.

17:16.542 --> 17:18.083
Yeah, how?

17:18.166 --> 17:19.959
I told my parents
Truly stole money from me

17:20.041 --> 17:23.500
but she told them the truth
about the gun.

17:23.583 --> 17:25.625
- But they believed you.
- No.

17:25.709 --> 17:27.250
They believed her.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.917
Came down on me
like a ton of bricks.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.917
But Truly said she was fired
the next day.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.125
Yeah, she was.
For stealing.

17:33.208 --> 17:34.834
My parents were jerks.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.291
So, you're 16 years old.

17:36.375 --> 17:38.166
How do you get your hands
on a MAC-10?

17:38.250 --> 17:40.125
Hmm, that's kind of
a funny story.

17:41.542 --> 17:42.875
Well, maybe not that funny.

17:42.959 --> 17:45.542
See, we lived near this...
this riding club

17:45.625 --> 17:48.667
where I used to draw
pictures of Satan and stuff.

17:48.750 --> 17:49.959
Freak out the riders.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.125
This is gonna be
so cool!

18:04.208 --> 18:06.000
(boy)
It's judgment day,
Chipster.

18:06.083 --> 18:08.333
Hasta la vista,

18:12.375 --> 18:14.125
[laughing]
Sweet!

18:14.208 --> 18:15.333
Okay, let me try.

18:15.417 --> 18:16.959
Wait, I want to see what I hit.

18:19.709 --> 18:21.166
'Whoo!'

18:21.250 --> 18:24.208
Dude, check this out!

18:24.291 --> 18:26.083
Terminated!

18:28.750 --> 18:30.041
What is that?

18:34.583 --> 18:36.542
Holy crap.

18:41.458 --> 18:43.583
'Damn it, Pate!
You shot a horse!'

18:43.667 --> 18:45.959
Gross!
Its guts are spilling out!

18:46.041 --> 18:47.458
I didn't mean
to shoot that!

18:47.542 --> 18:48.667
Let's get the
hell
out of here.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.375
We can't just leave him
like this.

18:50.458 --> 18:51.875
What are we supposed to
do,
call a vet?

18:51.959 --> 18:53.917
You got to put it
out of its misery.

18:57.834 --> 19:00.041
- You shoot it.
- I'm not shooting a horse!

19:00.125 --> 19:01.500
Let's just get out of here.

19:06.583 --> 19:09.041
- They just left it there?
- He didn't suffer long.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.875
'Cause you found the gun
in those bushes?

19:10.959 --> 19:13.208
And I did what Chip 'n' Dale
couldn't.

19:13.291 --> 19:14.583
You ever get your hands
on another gun?

19:14.667 --> 19:17.542
My parents started watching me
like a hawk.

19:17.625 --> 19:21.375
Then I graduated high school,
got away from guys like Pate.

19:21.458 --> 19:23.583
Anger kind of just dissipated.

19:24.875 --> 19:27.792
So, how'd Pate come
into that MAC-10?

19:27.875 --> 19:29.667
Main Line Yacht Club.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.000
Bought it from some guy
named Witherspoon.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.125
Least that's what I heard them
bragging about.

19:35.750 --> 19:36.875
Okay, Eric.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.417
Hey,
i-if you see Truly again

19:41.500 --> 19:43.000
will you apologize to her
for me?

19:44.542 --> 19:47.250
You know, for being
such a demented kid.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.041
Why don't you tell her yourself?

19:49.125 --> 19:51.083
Ain't like she lives
in Antarctica.

19:56.834 --> 19:58.291
(Jeffries)
'Our Mac 10
was not delivered'

19:58.375 --> 20:01.083
to any gun store in the
greater
Philadelphia area.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.125
And I got the paper cuts
to prove it.

20:03.208 --> 20:04.250
So, it was stolen.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.542
'Got us thinking
about who was'

20:05.625 --> 20:07.333
delivering those guns
for Barkin.

20:07.417 --> 20:09.542
So, we checked the employment
rolls...Philly-Haul, '87.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.458
That's the company
transported the guns?

20:11.542 --> 20:13.959
Interesting name
on their list of drivers.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.667
Rodney Johnson.

20:15.750 --> 20:17.166
The 911 caller.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.625
And maybe a target
of the drive-by

20:18.709 --> 20:21.291
since he was out on the court
that night.

20:21.375 --> 20:23.875
- Oh, that's some coincidence.
- Or not.

20:23.959 --> 20:26.458
This guy transported the gun
that almost killed him?

20:26.542 --> 20:29.083
Clincher is, the guy
fighting
with Cedric Browning

20:29.166 --> 20:30.208
on that videotape?

20:30.291 --> 20:31.500
Rodney again?

20:31.583 --> 20:33.500
One and the same.

20:33.583 --> 20:35.917
A lot of roads
all leading in one
direction..

20:36.000 --> 20:37.542
...right to Rodney Johnson.

20:46.917 --> 20:49.083
(Vera)
'Talked to your old boss
at Philly-Haul, Rodney.'

20:49.166 --> 20:51.458
(Jeffries)
'Said you were fired because
your cargo had a habit'

20:51.542 --> 20:53.417
of coming in late and light.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.166
Those accusations
were
unsubstantial.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.792
Well, one of the MAC-10s
you were hauling

20:57.875 --> 20:59.333
turned out to be
a murder weapon.

20:59.417 --> 21:02.000
Killed a six-year-old...
Kayla Odoms.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.291
(Vera)
'You remember Kayla.'

21:03.375 --> 21:07.000
- You called in the 911.
- Yeah, I remember.

21:07.083 --> 21:09.375
So, who do you figure
the shooter was that night?

21:09.458 --> 21:10.542
How do I know?

21:10.625 --> 21:12.041
Because you sold them the gun.

21:12.125 --> 21:13.333
- Me?
- 'You.'

21:17.542 --> 21:22.083
"Statue" of limitations on
"theftery" is up, right?

21:22.166 --> 21:25.667
Then I admit...
I moved a lot of guns.

21:25.750 --> 21:28.166
So, who'd you sell one to
that might want to see you
dead?

21:28.250 --> 21:32.250
Look here, my AKA back then
was Big Mac

21:32.333 --> 21:34.625
on account of how many guns
I flipped.

21:34.709 --> 21:36.834
- How many?
- Hundreds.

21:36.917 --> 21:38.291
And I made it a point

21:38.375 --> 21:41.083
of not getting to
know
my clientele.

21:41.166 --> 21:43.834
Let's talk about
Cedric Browning, Rodney.

21:43.917 --> 21:45.041
What was your fight
with him about?

21:45.125 --> 21:46.208
Excuse?

21:46.291 --> 21:47.542
At the park,
night of the murder

21:47.625 --> 21:48.792
you were
hassling each other.

21:50.166 --> 21:51.750
That was a personal dispute.

21:51.834 --> 21:53.291
He was in my face
'cause his woman

21:53.375 --> 21:55.250
was casting them
"pherachromes" my way.

21:55.333 --> 21:57.000
And you weren't waving them off.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.500
- Maybe it was him.
- Cedric wasn't the shooter.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.417
He was selling peanuts
at the Phillies game that
night.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.875
You get in a lot
of domestic disputes, Rodney?

22:03.959 --> 22:05.709
With boyfriends, husbands maybe?

22:05.792 --> 22:08.291
I tried not to...mess
with the married
ladies.

22:08.375 --> 22:11.667
- Tried?
- I failed on occasion.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.750
One in particular.

22:13.834 --> 22:16.083
Guess it don't make
no difference now.

22:16.166 --> 22:17.000
Who?

22:17.083 --> 22:19.542
Dead girl's mom? Jessie.

22:47.792 --> 22:49.709
Mr. Witherspoon?

22:49.792 --> 22:51.917
(male #??)
'I'm Witherspoon.'

22:53.625 --> 22:55.625
Who wants to know?

22:55.709 --> 22:57.291
Philly PD.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.083
Philly PD, huh?

22:59.166 --> 23:02.166
Whatever it is,
I didn't do it.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.291
Hear you sold a weapon
to a kid named Pate.

23:04.375 --> 23:05.792
Back in '93.

23:05.875 --> 23:07.709
'93, uh..

23:07.792 --> 23:09.458
Possible.

23:09.542 --> 23:12.834
I had a small problem with
the grain industry back then.

23:12.917 --> 23:14.125
How's that?

23:14.208 --> 23:16.583
I needed whatever...cash
I could muster.

23:16.667 --> 23:18.792
So you sold a MAC-10
to a teenager?

23:18.875 --> 23:22.125
My judgment was impaired.

23:22.208 --> 23:23.375
So where'd you get the Mac?

23:23.458 --> 23:25.792
You ever heard
of Chicken Little?

23:25.875 --> 23:28.458
'Cause that night,
I was Chicken Little.

23:28.542 --> 23:30.041
What night would that be?

23:30.125 --> 23:31.959
The night my
better half kicked me

23:32.041 --> 23:33.834
out of the house.

23:33.917 --> 23:36.000
I slept by the river.

24:03.583 --> 24:05.834
Bitch!

24:11.542 --> 24:13.208
I was sure it was my wife

24:13.291 --> 24:15.041
sending me a
not-so-subtle message

24:15.125 --> 24:16.667
to blow my brains out.

24:16.750 --> 24:19.125
- When was this?
- August, '87.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.750
I remember because

24:20.834 --> 24:24.750
I swore off the hard stuff
right then and there.

24:24.834 --> 24:26.041
The hard stuff, mind you.

24:26.125 --> 24:29.041
Not the entire family
of alcoholic beverages.

24:29.125 --> 24:30.875
That look at the car you got.

24:30.959 --> 24:32.208
You sure you were
seein' it straight?

24:32.291 --> 24:33.875
(Witherspoon)
'Yeah.'

24:33.959 --> 24:36.583
It was a Plymouth. Volare.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.500
Like, like the song.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.250
Before your time.

24:45.333 --> 24:47.834
Can you remember
anything about the
driver?

24:47.917 --> 24:50.125
- Anything at all.
- No.

24:50.208 --> 24:52.208
Just the car.
And that it wasn't my wife's.

24:52.291 --> 24:55.583
''Cause she was on a one-way
train to Augusta that night.'

24:57.458 --> 24:59.875
Last time I ever saw her.

25:06.834 --> 25:08.875
Rodney Johnson?

25:10.500 --> 25:12.417
Worst mistake of my life.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.000
Who knew?

25:14.083 --> 25:15.792
- No one.
- You sure?

25:17.250 --> 25:19.041
If you're thinking
about my husband, don't.

25:19.125 --> 25:20.583
'Cause he didn't know.

25:20.667 --> 25:22.208
How can you be so sure?

25:22.291 --> 25:24.083
Because I've been with him
for the last 18 years.

25:24.166 --> 25:25.917
Don't you think he would have
mentioned it by now?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.375
Unless he had a reason not to.

25:27.458 --> 25:30.500
He didn't know. And you can't
tell him. Promise me.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.250
Sorry, Jessie, I can't do that.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.083
Why? Why should he suffer now

25:36.166 --> 25:38.917
because I was a fool
18 years ago?

25:39.000 --> 25:42.041
'Cause I was lonely and selfish.

25:42.125 --> 25:43.917
Did you know Rodney
had other women?

25:45.709 --> 25:48.291
I was stupid. Not blind.

25:48.375 --> 25:50.458
You saw him with someone else.

25:50.542 --> 25:52.208
That day.

25:52.291 --> 25:54.375
At Darnell's birthday party.

25:56.041 --> 25:57.792
You think
Mr. and Mrs. Kissy-face

25:57.875 --> 25:59.709
will have babies, Darnell?

25:59.792 --> 26:02.375
No, gouramis don't
mate in captivity.

26:02.458 --> 26:05.792
- Oh.
- It's a good cake, baby.

26:05.875 --> 26:07.458
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

26:07.542 --> 26:09.583
Ah, no problem.

26:13.375 --> 26:16.125
You like the mitt
more than the fish?

26:16.208 --> 26:17.792
No, I like 'em
both the same.

26:19.125 --> 26:21.709
- You all right?
- Yeah. Sure, I'm good.

26:24.667 --> 26:26.875
Well, I got
a double shift tonight.

26:26.959 --> 26:29.000
You got to go?

26:30.208 --> 26:31.834
12 years old.

26:31.917 --> 26:35.000
You the man now.

26:35.083 --> 26:36.667
(Mike)
'Happy birthday, son.'

26:36.750 --> 26:38.667
(Kayla)
'My birthday's coming up,
too.'

26:38.750 --> 26:40.875
[laughs]
Yeah, we know.

26:48.917 --> 26:50.208
Mom.

26:50.291 --> 26:52.083
'Dad's leaving.'

26:52.166 --> 26:54.291
'Don't you want
to say goodbye?'

27:00.750 --> 27:03.333
I was such a fool.

27:03.417 --> 27:05.583
Thought my heart was
actually breakin'.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.375
Crazy, right?

27:10.458 --> 27:12.417
Considering what God
was about to teach me

27:12.500 --> 27:14.041
about real heartbreak.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.542
It wasn't chance, was it?

27:15.625 --> 27:17.750
You going back
to that park that night?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.250
Now you know why
Kayla's dying is my fault.

27:23.166 --> 27:24.458
Did you go to confront Rodney?

27:25.875 --> 27:28.041
More like to kick
his worthless ass.

27:29.667 --> 27:32.291
But by the time I got there,
he was already playin' ball.

27:32.375 --> 27:33.709
So you waited.

27:33.792 --> 27:35.875
Took Kayla to the swings.

27:37.750 --> 27:42.375
Any justice in the world,
that bullet would have hit me.

27:42.458 --> 27:44.458
not her.

27:52.834 --> 27:55.000
Scotty.

27:55.083 --> 27:56.291
Come in. It's freezing.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.333
Uh, nah.

27:58.417 --> 28:00.291
Can't.

28:00.375 --> 28:02.083
Why not?

28:02.166 --> 28:04.208
Chris, uh..

28:05.500 --> 28:06.792
...that night.

28:08.625 --> 28:10.083
It was a mistake.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.083
It was?

28:11.166 --> 28:12.417
Because..

28:12.500 --> 28:15.250
- You know.
- No, I don't know.

28:15.333 --> 28:17.041
Your sister.

28:17.125 --> 28:19.500
It's..

28:19.583 --> 28:21.333
It's ill-advised.

28:23.709 --> 28:26.041
Scotty, I know what this is.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.375
You're thinking about Elisa.

28:31.458 --> 28:33.625
I can't be anything
to anyone right now.

28:36.542 --> 28:38.625
- I'm sorry.
- Well..

28:39.667 --> 28:40.917
For the record..

28:41.000 --> 28:43.458
- I'm not.
- Look.

28:43.542 --> 28:45.375
I don't plan on telling Lil.

28:45.458 --> 28:48.125
Me neither.

28:48.208 --> 28:50.250
It's better that way.

28:54.375 --> 28:57.208
If you change your mind..

28:57.291 --> 28:59.333
I'm right here.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.583
Yeah.

29:04.667 --> 29:06.667
Okay.

29:26.375 --> 29:27.834
Uh, we sure
Mike Odoms didn't know

29:27.917 --> 29:30.500
about his wife's
affair
with Rodney Johnson?

29:30.583 --> 29:31.834
Jessie says no.

29:31.917 --> 29:34.208
'Cause Lil just got
a DMV report from '87.

29:34.291 --> 29:36.250
And the car that was
seen
dumping our MAC-10

29:36.333 --> 29:38.166
off the bridge
was a Plymouth
Volare.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.667
And guess who owned
a Volare back then?

29:40.750 --> 29:42.917
Please don't say Mike Odoms.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.333
Maybe he didn't
confront
Rodney face-to-face.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.125
Maybe it was at a distance.

29:47.208 --> 29:49.458
So we're saying if Mike
found out about Rodney..

29:49.542 --> 29:51.333
Maybe he set out
to get rid of the man

29:51.417 --> 29:53.000
coming between him and his wife.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.875
(Rush)
'And trying to kill Rodney'

29:54.959 --> 29:57.041
he shot his own daughter.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.375
My wife is a good woman.

30:03.458 --> 30:05.000
Don't try and tell me otherwise.

30:05.083 --> 30:06.917
We're not saying that, Mike.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.875
But we are saying
Jessie had an affair

30:08.959 --> 30:11.333
with Rodney Johnson in '87.

30:11.417 --> 30:14.667
And Rodney Johnson was
the target of that drive-by.

30:14.750 --> 30:15.875
So what?

30:15.959 --> 30:17.458
You think I tried to kill him?

30:17.542 --> 30:20.208
My wife stepped out on me
with a lowlife like Rodney..

30:20.291 --> 30:22.834
Think about what
you're saying to me,
detectives.

30:22.917 --> 30:25.375
We're saying you had a motive
to shoot Rodney Johnson.

30:25.458 --> 30:27.583
The oldest reason
in the book.

30:27.667 --> 30:29.542
- Revenge.
- No.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.792
You're sayin'
I killed my own daughter.

30:31.875 --> 30:32.959
I'm not gonna sit here

30:33.041 --> 30:35.542
and take that kind
of disrespect.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.083
All right, Mike.

30:37.166 --> 30:40.125
How do you explain that your
car
was ID'd as the shooter's?

30:40.208 --> 30:41.375
I can't.

30:41.458 --> 30:43.667
I was workin'.
It don't make no sense.

30:43.750 --> 30:45.917
Could someone
have borrowed your car?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.250
I know I didn't
let no one use
it.

30:47.333 --> 30:49.667
And Jessie would
have said if she did.

30:49.750 --> 30:51.125
So, who else
could have taken it?

30:51.208 --> 30:53.250
There wasn't nobody
else home to take
it.

30:56.333 --> 30:57.792
Except Darnell.

30:59.333 --> 31:01.041
Darnell was 12 years old!

31:01.125 --> 31:02.792
I knew how to drive
when I was 12.

31:02.875 --> 31:04.917
Well, Darnell didn't.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.750
Now I know that for a fact.

31:06.834 --> 31:08.125
'An absolute fact.'

31:08.208 --> 31:10.583
My boy did not know
how to drive.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.959
You don't recognize him?

31:20.041 --> 31:21.792
Looks awful young
for one of my customers.

31:21.875 --> 31:23.125
(Vera)
'Come off it, Rodney.'

31:23.208 --> 31:25.959
You'd sell to a toddler
if they had the cash.

31:26.041 --> 31:28.083
Look again.

31:30.875 --> 31:32.792
Yeah, it's possible
I did business

31:32.875 --> 31:34.000
with a boy looked like this.

31:34.083 --> 31:35.792
- Possible?
- Now keep in mind.

31:35.875 --> 31:39.333
I wasn't selling out of K-Mart
with them fluorescent lights.

31:39.417 --> 31:40.917
Semi or full?

31:41.000 --> 31:43.125
The Big Mac
don't inventory semis.

31:43.208 --> 31:45.458
Bad boys I sell
all

31:45.542 --> 31:47.625
We'll take six.

31:53.041 --> 31:55.333
- You're the man, Big Mac.
- Hey.

31:55.417 --> 31:57.291
Hey. Been a pleasure
mercantiling with you.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.500
- All right.
- Right.

32:06.041 --> 32:08.083
I wanna buy a gun.

32:13.041 --> 32:14.291
That's good.

32:14.375 --> 32:17.542
'Cause I'm fresh out of milk
and cookies, young blood.

32:17.625 --> 32:19.083
<i>Miami Vice?</i>

32:19.166 --> 32:21.834
Crocket and Tubbs?
Them's my boys.

32:21.917 --> 32:24.458
'Cause the guns they use,
that's the kind I want.

32:24.542 --> 32:26.750
Choice of professional
gangsters everywhere.

32:27.959 --> 32:29.834
Converted MAC-10.

32:29.917 --> 32:32.417
Fully automatic assault weapon.

32:32.500 --> 32:35.750
30 rounds per second.

32:35.834 --> 32:37.166
How much?

32:37.250 --> 32:41.000
For a beginner banger like
yourself out to make his
bones?

32:41.083 --> 32:43.583
A Benjamin.

32:43.667 --> 32:45.166
Is that including the bullets?

32:45.250 --> 32:46.333
One clip.

32:46.417 --> 32:48.542
You need more,
you come back and see me.

32:57.458 --> 32:59.166
This your lunch money or what?

32:59.250 --> 33:01.291
Can I have my gun?

33:17.625 --> 33:18.917
wry laugh

33:19.000 --> 33:21.083
You bad now, boy.

33:24.375 --> 33:25.417
So, who is this boy?

33:25.500 --> 33:28.250
Jessie's son. Darnell.

33:29.583 --> 33:31.083
Damn.

33:31.166 --> 33:33.333
I ain't know Jessie had a son.

33:33.417 --> 33:34.583
Why would you?

33:34.667 --> 33:37.583
Considering your interest
in the woman?

33:37.667 --> 33:40.125
You know, Kayla would be alive
today if it weren't for you.

33:40.208 --> 33:41.417
How you figure?

33:41.500 --> 33:42.959
You provided the motive
and the weapon.

33:43.041 --> 33:44.917
And there ain't no
statue

33:45.000 --> 33:46.041
on aiding and abetting.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.041
Now, come on, now!

33:47.125 --> 33:48.083
Maybe the DA can bump it up

33:48.166 --> 33:49.792
to conspiracy to commit murder.

33:49.875 --> 33:51.208
Conspiracy?

33:51.291 --> 33:53.583
I didn't pull no triggers.

33:53.667 --> 33:54.583
Don't need to.

33:54.667 --> 33:56.792
Just got to give the assist.

34:05.959 --> 34:07.083
Mr. and Mrs. Odoms.

34:08.208 --> 34:09.458
Figured you'd be comin'.

34:09.542 --> 34:11.583
And we knew why,
so we got something to say.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.709
You don't need to say anything.

34:13.792 --> 34:16.542
I fired that gun. killed Kayla.

34:18.458 --> 34:20.291
Mr. Odoms.

34:20.375 --> 34:21.375
It's too late for that.

34:21.458 --> 34:22.959
I went home in my cab..

34:23.041 --> 34:25.709
...got in my car
and drove by the
park.

34:25.792 --> 34:26.792
Shot it up.

34:26.875 --> 34:27.792
It's true.

34:27.875 --> 34:29.375
'I saw him.'

34:29.458 --> 34:34.375
I ??don't want to say
anything
'cause...I love the man.

34:34.458 --> 34:36.542
That true, Darnell?

34:38.542 --> 34:41.458
You don't got
to confess for me, Dad.

34:41.542 --> 34:43.792
- They know.
- They don't know nothin'.

34:43.875 --> 34:46.667
- 'Do you?'
- I wish I didn't.

34:48.542 --> 34:50.583
I really do.

34:58.458 --> 35:00.000
We've already lost one child.

35:00.083 --> 35:02.625
You can't take away
the only one we got left.

35:02.709 --> 35:04.375
[crying]
Oh, please..

35:04.458 --> 35:06.333
- I'm sorry.
- He was 12.

35:06.417 --> 35:08.583
Courts will take that
into consideration.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.583
Why'd you do it, Darnell?

35:13.750 --> 35:16.125
To keep 'em together.

35:16.208 --> 35:18.417
So how'd you know it was Rodney
coming between 'em?

35:20.875 --> 35:23.041
(Darnell)
'Heard my mom on the phone.'

35:24.750 --> 35:26.667
And then at the birthday party

35:26.750 --> 35:29.041
I saw the way
she was lookin' at him.

35:29.125 --> 35:31.375
And I just knew.

35:31.458 --> 35:36.417
Then I thought
about my dad in his cab..

35:36.500 --> 35:38.625
...working his ass off.

35:38.709 --> 35:41.875
And when my mom told me
she was going...to take Kayla

35:41.959 --> 35:43.375
out for a walk that night..

35:43.458 --> 35:44.834
You knew you could take the car

35:44.917 --> 35:47.000
and no one would know.

35:48.917 --> 35:51.375
If only I would've known
you were going to that park!

35:51.458 --> 35:54.375
'I would've never
pulled that trigger.'

35:54.458 --> 35:56.542
But I didn't know.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.792
I didn't see you..

36:00.875 --> 36:02.917
Or Kayla..

36:06.959 --> 36:08.709
...till it was too late.

36:29.959 --> 36:31.917
Let me get that. Watchya got?

36:39.166 --> 36:41.208
You're bad now, boy.

36:54.583 --> 36:56.583
(Jessie)
'No!'

36:56.667 --> 36:58.208
'Kayla!'

37:08.625 --> 37:11.625
[crying]
Wake up! Wake up for Mommy!
