01:15.367 --> 01:18.787
This girl living in a tent
outside of this big old house?

01:18.787 --> 01:19.955
Something is wrong with her.

01:19.955 --> 01:22.291
Since I'm pretty much solving
this case by myself,

01:22.291 --> 01:24.042
I'm gonna take the lead
interviewing Hannah.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.712
- You guys can back me up.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.714
She's obviously obsessed with her brother.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.717
She didn't want him to get married.
That is what we call motive.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.720
I mean, it's a pretty plausible idea.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.222
Okay. We'll do it your way.

01:37.222 --> 01:41.518
But just remember,
we actually need Hannah to talk to us.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.730
Oh, come on. I found the murder weapon.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.025
Plus, her typewriter key
was in Edgar's pocket.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.694
Now we just gotta catch her in a lie.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.659
Shalom. Welcome to my home.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.119
Please excuse the untidiness.

01:59.828 --> 02:03.665
Okay,
enough with the being a gracious host.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.293
We are here to talk to you about this.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.544
The devil's trumpet.

02:08.544 --> 02:09.545
Yes.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.633
So you think that's what killed Edgar.
And because it's from my garden,

02:12.633 --> 02:14.593
- you think that I killed him.
- Exactly.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.595
Well, should I procure a lawyer,

02:16.595 --> 02:18.764
or should we just head
straight to my execution?

02:18.764 --> 02:21.725
Hannah, we just wanna hear
your side of the story.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.479
- No one's here to accuse you of anything.
- I am.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.523
Why do you have Edgar's dead lizard?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.525
I'm sorry. Do you want her?

02:30.108 --> 02:31.151
No.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.654
Well, she's my niece,
so please don't talk about her like that.

02:33.654 --> 02:37.157
Look, we're here because Travis said
that you wanted to stop the wedding.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.910
I did.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.329
Very much so.

02:42.329 --> 02:45.499
Your own brother's wedding?
Why did you wanna stop it?

02:48.627 --> 02:49.628
Very well.

02:51.880 --> 02:52.881
Please.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.432
Do you like music?

03:03.141 --> 03:04.810
I think everybody likes music.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.355
I know.

03:21.577 --> 03:24.204
My story begins
with this precocious young girl.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.207
Hannah Cornelia Minnows
was the adopted child

03:27.207 --> 03:29.084
of Alexander and Isabel Minnows.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.504
<i>When she came of age, 11 to be exact,</i>

03:32.504 --> 03:35.507
<i>she built herself a yurt
fashioned after the Mongolian Ger.</i>

03:39.178 --> 03:41.638
<i>It was one of her many hobbies.</i>

03:42.514 --> 03:44.808
<i>Hannah was denied
proper affection as a child.</i>

03:45.976 --> 03:48.604
<i>So she found herself
engaging in unique activities</i>

03:48.604 --> 03:50.105
<i>that would help pass the time.</i>

03:57.988 --> 03:59.573
<i>Often Edgar would join her.</i>

04:00.157 --> 04:03.452
<i>Having a frigid mother and an absent
father brought them together.</i>

04:06.455 --> 04:08.540
<i>Sebastian would often join as well.</i>

04:08.540 --> 04:11.502
<i>Despite presumably having his own family
in England,</i>

04:11.502 --> 04:13.629
<i>he was a regular fixture
at the Minnows home.</i>

04:13.629 --> 04:15.881
<i>Though Edgar never liked an audience.</i>

04:28.727 --> 04:32.814
<i>As they grew older, Edgar became
more dogged about his business endeavors.</i>

04:33.607 --> 04:35.609
<i>He lost interest in their mutual hobbies.</i>

04:36.735 --> 04:39.613
<i>But Hannah's love for her brother
remained steadfast and true.</i>

04:41.323 --> 04:42.991
Happy Birthday!

04:43.492 --> 04:46.495
It's actually my adoption day.
I don't know when I was born.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.971
Hannah, this is Grace.

05:04.471 --> 05:08.642
She sold me this typewriter
so that I could give it to you.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.895
So, I guess one could say
that it's from both of us.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.233
I'm really thrilled it's going to someone
who will really appreciate it

05:16.233 --> 05:17.943
for all of its quirks and charms.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.279
It's perfect.

05:24.867 --> 05:27.035
It's my telephone. Excuse me.

05:27.536 --> 05:29.162
Bartholomew, you ne'er-do-well.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.752
Edgar told me
the theme of your party is "Francophile."

05:35.752 --> 05:37.171
Are you French?

05:37.171 --> 05:38.463
I don't know.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.008
But I'm turned on by their culture.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.218
They're an unkind and beautiful people.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.887
I'd like to live there someday.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.099
In a really rundown building
with charming fixtures.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.979
Edgar tells me you share my penchant
for antique oddities.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.273
Yes, the odder the better.

05:56.857 --> 06:00.235
I get really caught up
imagining the life it's had.

06:00.235 --> 06:04.198
- The places it's traveled to.
- I'd like to show you something.

06:04.823 --> 06:05.657
Okay.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.998
Is that a Blickensderfer No. 7?

06:12.998 --> 06:14.583
It is a Blickensderfer No. 7.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.169
She's beautiful.

06:18.670 --> 06:19.671
She really is.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.674
<i>Hannah and Grace were immediately friends.</i>

06:22.674 --> 06:25.177
<i>And soon, Grace and Edgar
were engaged to be married.</i>

06:25.677 --> 06:29.431
<i>Hannah felt a kinship with her,
and the two spent more time together.</i>

06:29.431 --> 06:31.683
<i>Wait, you were in Amsterdam with Grace?</i>

06:31.683 --> 06:34.102
Wasn't that supposed to be
a lunch date with Edgar?

06:34.102 --> 06:36.522
He was very busy with work,
so I took his place.

06:36.522 --> 06:38.190
Grace didn't tell me that.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.403
<i>On an overcast Saturday afternoon,</i>

06:43.403 --> 06:45.822
<i>exactly 37 days before the wedding,</i>

06:45.822 --> 06:49.076
<i>Grace and her bachelorette party
congregated by Lake Swellgood.</i>

06:49.868 --> 06:53.539
<i>The lake is forested with maple,
redwood and orange blossom trees.</i>

06:53.539 --> 06:57.543
<i>There were spa treatments, arts and crafts
and a mime who was also a stripper.</i>

06:57.543 --> 06:59.086
<i>It was your perfect bachelorette.</i>

06:59.086 --> 07:00.963
<i>Except that Grace was fighting with Zoë.</i>

07:00.963 --> 07:03.215
You think marriage will fix your problems?

07:03.215 --> 07:05.259
The guy can't even bring you chicken--

07:05.259 --> 07:06.385
"...soup!"

07:06.385 --> 07:09.304
Okay, I just wanna say again,
I was not yelling.

07:09.304 --> 07:12.975
And we were not fighting.
I was just worried about my sister,

07:13.475 --> 07:15.853
and that is what older sisters
are supposed to do.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.605
If you want, I could just say that
you were intensely whispering.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.066
You think a marriage
will fix all your problems?

07:21.066 --> 07:22.860
This guy can't even bring you soup.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.529
I mean, that wasn't what happened either.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.448
Why don't we just skip ahead
to what happened next?

07:28.448 --> 07:29.741
We shall.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.953
Can I get you anything?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.288
Jamón ibérico?

07:34.830 --> 07:36.039
Courtesan au chocolat?

07:37.499 --> 07:38.750
Swig of whiskey?

07:40.335 --> 07:42.296
No, thank you. I'm too upset.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.507
Also, I really think whiskey
tastes like drinking a catcher's mitt.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.134
I agree.

07:49.178 --> 07:53.265
So, are you upset because your sister
is right or because she's wrong?

07:54.057 --> 07:55.267
I'm not sure.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.688
You know better than anyone
how busy Edgar's been lately.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.233
But I know he wants to be with me.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.943
Well, what do you want?

08:04.943 --> 08:06.570
Well, I want love.

08:08.113 --> 08:12.534
Heart-bursting, mind-exploding,
nipple-chilling love.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.119
You know?

08:15.162 --> 08:17.206
All I know is that Edgar is so lucky

08:17.206 --> 08:19.124
to be marrying
someone as wonderful as you.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.052
I'm so sorry, I shouldn't have done that.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.640
<i>No fucking way.</i>

08:35.640 --> 08:37.518
You kissed my sister?

08:37.518 --> 08:41.063
Technically, she kissed me, but I was
very willing and very consensual.

08:41.980 --> 08:45.817
Bachelorette parties are so juicy.
Good stuff come out of them.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.737
If this really happened,
why wouldn't Grace tell me?

08:48.737 --> 08:51.740
Maybe 'cause you wouldn't stop
whisper-shouting at her.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.243
Or maybe
because it makes her look very guilty.

08:56.286 --> 08:59.039
Well, I don't believe it.
I need to go talk to Grace.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.207
Tell her I say hi.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.751
Whoa. Hey, hold up.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.503
Now, if we wanna solve this,

09:04.503 --> 09:06.672
we have to finish hearing
what Hannah has to say.

09:06.672 --> 09:09.007
Why? She is obviously lying.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.010
Zoë, Danner's right.
We should hear her out.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.097
You know what?

09:15.097 --> 09:19.309
I think it might be better for all of us
if we conduct separate investigations.

09:20.686 --> 09:21.645
Zoë.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.814
I should go with her, right?

09:23.814 --> 09:28.986
Nuh-uh. Look, I know you love her,
but that is some sister shit.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.243
Okay, so y'all was kissing.

09:42.541 --> 09:45.502
You are not gonna believe
what Hannah is saying about you.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.087
Would you stop whisper-shouting?

09:47.671 --> 09:48.714
I'm not.

09:55.846 --> 09:58.223
Can we please not do this here?

09:58.223 --> 09:59.975
Oh, my God, is it true?

09:59.975 --> 10:03.937
There are things that are true, yes.
But this is not the time--

10:03.937 --> 10:05.564
Girls, everything all right?

10:06.231 --> 10:08.609
Yeah. Everything's fine.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.194
Is it though?

10:12.946 --> 10:16.366
Well, obviously
other than the big thing that's not fine.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.369
Feng, can I borrow you?

10:19.369 --> 10:20.621
It's business.

10:20.621 --> 10:25.918
Business? Yeah, absolutely.
It's like they say, "Money never--"

10:25.918 --> 10:27.586
- Now, please.
- Yep, coming.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.924
You know, do you wanna talk outside?

10:31.924 --> 10:34.218
- Yeah, I'd love that.
- How wonderful for both of us.

10:34.218 --> 10:35.844
Cute. Sister time.

10:38.388 --> 10:43.519
Feng, do you mind if I ask, what are you?

10:43.519 --> 10:47.356
Wow. Great question. So many things.

10:47.356 --> 10:50.567
I'm a businessman. A father. A dreamer.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.735
Ethnically.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.531
Well, my mother was Korean,
but my father w--

10:55.531 --> 10:56.823
Thank God. Do you speak it?

10:56.823 --> 10:59.284
- Korean? Yeah, but--
- Fantastic.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.204
I have a very important deal out of Busan,

11:02.204 --> 11:04.331
and I was hoping that,
as a fellow businessman,

11:04.331 --> 11:06.291
you might be able to help me close it.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.920
Be the Rosetta to my stone.
What do you say?

11:10.504 --> 11:14.216
I say you came to the right guy.
I'm an ace negotiator.

11:14.216 --> 11:17.553
- You'll see. This will be a bowl of bing.
- A what?

11:17.553 --> 11:20.722
Like "piece of cake," but "bing."
It doesn't matter. I would l--

11:21.849 --> 11:23.642
There we are. Careful.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.310
This guy's a real knacker cracker.

11:27.813 --> 11:31.358
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, how are you?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.610
My name is Feng Zhu.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.655
I'm a... top business partner of--

11:36.655 --> 11:41.869
<i>Tell Sebastian I'm in.
I'll take five million.</i>

11:46.748 --> 11:48.125
This guy's playing hardball.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.002
What? Really?

11:50.586 --> 11:51.587
Damn it.

11:51.587 --> 11:56.300
<i>Hello? Are you saying something?
What are you saying?</i>

11:56.300 --> 11:59.803
Tell him I will go 5% percent lower,
but that's my basement.

11:59.803 --> 12:00.888
Okay.

12:01.471 --> 12:06.518
How's the weather in Busan?

12:06.518 --> 12:09.938
- By now it's around bedtime I guess!
- <i>What?</i>

12:09.938 --> 12:13.066
I'm just saying words so it sounds
like we're negotiating!

12:13.775 --> 12:17.738
<i>I don't understand.
Are you in or are you out?</i>

12:17.738 --> 12:20.532
- What's he saying?
- He's furious.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.659
- I'm gonna have to sweet-talk him.
- Don't lose this.

12:22.659 --> 12:28.040
All right, all right. Let's proceed
as originally negotiated then, okay?

12:28.040 --> 12:31.960
<i>As originally negotiated?
What is all this nonsense?</i>

12:32.878 --> 12:38.300
That's nice. Thank you.
Sure, I'll contact you soon again.

12:38.967 --> 12:39.843
Bye.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.094
<i>Whatever.</i>

12:41.803 --> 12:44.640
That's it? What happened?

12:44.640 --> 12:48.602
He's in and at the original price.

12:49.811 --> 12:50.812
No discount?

12:50.812 --> 12:51.980
No discount!

12:51.980 --> 12:54.775
I've gotta say, you have really
come through on this one, mate.

12:54.775 --> 12:55.859
Thank you, Feng.

12:56.735 --> 13:00.364
Hey. Like I told you, "bowl of bing."

13:00.364 --> 13:02.241
Whatever that is.

13:02.241 --> 13:05.369
So, now that we're working together,

13:05.369 --> 13:07.996
and Edgar is technically
unavailable forever,

13:07.996 --> 13:10.832
I would love to discuss
a business opportunity with you.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.795
Absolutely. No, yeah, I'd love to do that.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.088
Great.

13:16.088 --> 13:19.007
We'll set a time and then,
you know, knock it around.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.092
All right.

13:20.092 --> 13:22.970
Imagine ribbons of ice shaved so fine,

13:22.970 --> 13:26.306
it melts the second it hits your tongue.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.768
But it's-- And you-- Where are you?

13:30.978 --> 13:33.146
So, this kiss.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.441
If Grace didn't tell us about it,
why are you?

13:36.441 --> 13:38.944
Well, probably because it was
just a onetime mistake,

13:38.944 --> 13:41.655
and both of you realized that
and decided to pretend it never happened

13:41.655 --> 13:42.781
and move on with your lives?

13:42.781 --> 13:44.533
No, it happened many, many times.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.245
And it was the most thrilling month
of my entire life.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.085
We can't keep doing this.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.670
Okay.

14:05.596 --> 14:07.389
We can't keep doing this.

14:07.890 --> 14:08.807
Okay.

14:16.148 --> 14:17.566
We can't keep doing this.

14:18.984 --> 14:19.818
Okay.

14:21.195 --> 14:22.946
Dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.

14:27.201 --> 14:30.287
<i>Hannah and Grace both knew
it wasn't fair to Edgar.</i>

14:30.996 --> 14:35.083
<i>But they were so drawn to each other,
and Edgar was never around.</i>

14:36.376 --> 14:40.589
We should go on a trip to Paris, finally.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.176
Maybe Spain.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.887
The Florida Panhandle?

14:49.306 --> 14:51.058
I marry your brother in a week.

14:52.351 --> 14:53.977
Then we'll go the week after.

14:56.522 --> 14:57.856
Hannah...

14:59.942 --> 15:01.276
we have to stop.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.111
Okay.

15:03.111 --> 15:06.114
No. Like, I really mean it this time.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.453
I just feel
like I've been really awful to Edgar.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.163
Yeah, we both have.

15:14.581 --> 15:15.874
I'm sorry.

15:20.504 --> 15:21.713
But I'm in love with you.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.512
<i>And so Hannah entered a state of mourning.</i>

15:30.389 --> 15:31.306
Who is it?

15:31.306 --> 15:32.391
It's your mother.

15:33.392 --> 15:34.643
But I don't know my mother.

15:36.228 --> 15:37.229
It's you.

15:38.272 --> 15:39.898
Did you order a suit of armor?

15:39.898 --> 15:41.400
I don't think so.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.526
I guess I did.

15:43.735 --> 15:44.736
I like it.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.115
You look upset.

15:49.741 --> 15:50.742
I am upset.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.122
Well, get over it.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.293
<i>It was good advice,
and despite her sadness,</i>

15:59.293 --> 16:00.794
<i>Hannah decided to take it.</i>

16:02.546 --> 16:03.547
Get over it.

16:05.716 --> 16:06.717
Okay.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.803
<i>After all,
she had agreed to officiate the wedding.</i>

16:12.806 --> 16:14.183
<i>But at the rehearsal,</i>

16:14.183 --> 16:17.060
<i>when Hannah saw Grace
make her way towards the altar,</i>

16:17.644 --> 16:19.646
<i>she realized she would never get over it.</i>

16:33.410 --> 16:34.661
<i>She had to tell her.</i>

16:35.370 --> 16:36.413
I have to tell her.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.832
I'd like to tell everyone
about my flowers.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.752
They're from my Garden of the Bizarre.

16:42.586 --> 16:45.714
So first we have the Venus flytrap,
or Dionaea muscipula.

16:45.714 --> 16:48.509
Then we have the devil's trumpet,
Datura stramonium.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.303
And then some very lush Cannabis sativa

16:51.303 --> 16:53.305
that will take us
straight into outer space.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.642
<i>But to tell her,
Hannah needed a distraction.</i>

16:56.642 --> 16:58.227
Aniq knows what I'm talking about.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.187
He does drugs.

17:02.231 --> 17:04.525
There seems to be
a very big misunderstanding here.

17:04.525 --> 17:09.905
The only drugs I enjoy are life, family,
friends, ducks, in general...

17:09.905 --> 17:11.365
- When?
- ...babies and adults...

17:11.365 --> 17:15.536
...leather goods, such as belts,
Toblerone, a violin.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.290
What do you want?

17:20.290 --> 17:22.251
I want you to call off the wedding.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.127
Well, I can't do that.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.297
But I'm in love with you.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.216
I told you, I'm marrying your brother.

17:30.342 --> 17:31.426
But do you love him?

17:33.095 --> 17:34.137
Yeah. Of course I do.

17:37.850 --> 17:39.101
I have to go.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.061
Wait. Come to my yurt tonight.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.483
I'm sad.

17:48.694 --> 17:49.862
Hey, take my picture.

17:52.948 --> 17:53.949
Are you talking to me?

17:53.949 --> 17:55.325
You're the videographer, right?

17:55.909 --> 17:58.996
Kind of. I'm supposed to be invisible.

17:59.997 --> 18:00.998
I can relate.

18:13.385 --> 18:15.637
<i>When Hannah witnessed
that disturbing display of affection,</i>

18:15.637 --> 18:18.473
<i>she realized Grace was playing
some sort of game.</i>

18:18.473 --> 18:19.766
<i>So she thought to herself...</i>

18:19.766 --> 18:20.976
Okay, I'll play.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.189
Can I have this? I'm gonna have it.

18:27.733 --> 18:28.734
Who are you again?

18:29.776 --> 18:30.777
Grace's ex?

18:31.320 --> 18:32.321
Perfect.

18:34.865 --> 18:35.741
Just so you know,

18:36.700 --> 18:38.368
I'm here to take this wedding down.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.129
You're so funny. You're fun.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.674
You're full of adventure.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.094
Kiss me.

18:56.595 --> 18:57.596
What?

19:03.977 --> 19:06.563
Oh, my God. I'm wet.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.024
You should probably know,
I have a girlfriend.

19:09.024 --> 19:12.528
Her name is Weronika.
She's a nautical crane operator.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.245
<i>Hannah could see
the flash of jealousy in Grace's eyes.</i>

19:21.245 --> 19:24.039
<i>Now she was certain Grace would come
to her yurt that night.</i>

19:24.623 --> 19:26.917
<i>She decided to type Grace a letter.</i>

19:26.917 --> 19:29.127
<i>One that would
convey her feelings properly.</i>

19:29.127 --> 19:31.880
<i>Forged from the typewriter
that had brought them all together.</i>

19:46.895 --> 19:47.813
Grace?

19:50.983 --> 19:52.192
It's you.

19:52.693 --> 19:54.653
I couldn't sleep. Saw your light on.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.613
Thought you might need some company.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.449
- You look upset.
- I am upset.

19:59.950 --> 20:02.202
- Would you like to talk about it?
- Not really.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.205
I'm upset too.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.291
Tomorrow's a big day for both of us.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.627
You're losing a brother.
I'm losing a business partner.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.172
I think it's time for you to leave.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.301
You actually want me to go.

20:17.301 --> 20:18.677
- Right now.
- Cheerio.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.012
Bye.

20:23.682 --> 20:24.683
Please don't even...

20:28.645 --> 20:29.646
Oh, tits.

20:30.814 --> 20:31.815
Sorry.

20:31.815 --> 20:36.320
Hold up. Sebastian showed up here
Friday night looking to get busy?

20:37.112 --> 20:38.322
You hitting that too?

20:38.322 --> 20:41.283
Sebastian? Oh, no.
I don't find him attractive.

20:41.283 --> 20:45.871
Right. I mean, his face is,
like, so weird. And that accent.

20:45.871 --> 20:47.206
No, his accent's very charming.

20:47.206 --> 20:48.707
It's hot.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.049
I knew you weren't happy with Edgar.

20:57.049 --> 20:59.384
I knew it. Why didn't you just tell me?

20:59.384 --> 21:02.763
I didn't know how to.
I was cheating on Edgar.

21:03.972 --> 21:07.768
And Brett cheated on you,
and I know how much that hurt you.

21:07.768 --> 21:10.395
Right, I-- Well,

21:11.396 --> 21:13.315
do you have real feelings for her?

21:13.315 --> 21:17.402
No, it was just a fling.
I mean, I think I was confused.

21:17.402 --> 21:18.654
Are you sure?

21:19.238 --> 21:20.239
Yes.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.115
Okay.

21:22.741 --> 21:24.910
Then it's all gonna be fine.

21:24.910 --> 21:27.287
Just no more secrets.

21:27.287 --> 21:30.082
Because when you hide things,
it makes you look more guilty.

21:33.502 --> 21:36.922
Hey. I really don't think
Hannah could have killed him though.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.465
Yeah, well, someone did.

21:38.966 --> 21:41.844
And maybe
she was hoping it wasn't just a fling.

21:43.929 --> 21:46.932
Okay, so you sat up all night.

21:47.724 --> 21:48.892
Did Grace ever come?

21:48.892 --> 21:52.020
No. I was confused and frustrated,

21:52.020 --> 21:54.815
and so I needed to meditate
and just let off some steam.

22:04.783 --> 22:05.909
Sorry!

22:05.909 --> 22:07.077
First time?

22:07.703 --> 22:10.581
No, really bad at it.

22:14.668 --> 22:15.669
Welsh longbow.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.673
- Fifteenth century?
- I bought it from The Louvre.

22:21.049 --> 22:22.050
May I?

22:43.405 --> 22:44.615
Clearly done this before.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.409
I spent some time among the Apache.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.787
Well, among one Apache.

22:51.747 --> 22:53.957
Really nice guy.
He's actually a data analyst now.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.042
But he used to say,

22:55.042 --> 22:59.087
"Ulysses, your aim is off
because you're not shooting from here."

23:00.172 --> 23:01.298
And the Apache say,

23:01.298 --> 23:04.426
"Don't aim with your eyes,
aim with your heart."

23:06.094 --> 23:08.514
Of course, the Chippewa say,
"Aim with your eyes."

23:08.514 --> 23:10.182
And they won the war, so...

23:10.682 --> 23:13.560
Thank you
for that strange piece of wisdom.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.645
Don't give up.

23:15.521 --> 23:16.688
In archery or in love?

23:17.189 --> 23:18.440
Dealer's choice.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.824
Last night you told me
you wanted to stop the wedding.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.536
- Your brother is a criminal. I have proof.
- Great.

23:30.536 --> 23:32.204
So we'll stop this wedding together.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.164
Here's how we're gonna do it.

23:35.958 --> 23:37.543
<i>I'm going to officiate the wedding.</i>

23:38.752 --> 23:42.881
If anyone objects to this marriage,
speak now or forever hold your peace.

23:42.881 --> 23:44.758
<i>And then, you're gonna jump up and say...</i>

23:45.259 --> 23:47.386
I do! I object!

23:49.805 --> 23:54.184
As the officiant, I have no choice
but to allow this objection to be heard.

23:54.184 --> 23:56.061
What is your objection, sir?

23:56.061 --> 23:58.355
Edgar's a criminal! I have proof!

24:01.900 --> 24:03.527
You'll never take me alive!

24:05.195 --> 24:07.489
Citizen's arrest! Don't let him get away!

24:14.371 --> 24:16.999
You don't have to marry him now.
We can be together.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.126
I love you.

24:25.382 --> 24:28.594
"Citizens' arrest?"
I would never say that.

24:28.594 --> 24:30.804
Do you really think
your brother's a criminal?

24:30.804 --> 24:34.057
No. I-- He's just a capitalist.

24:34.057 --> 24:36.894
And why do you think he would run
if he hadn't done anything wrong?

24:36.894 --> 24:40.105
I'll admit
it wasn't a very well-thought-out scheme,

24:40.105 --> 24:42.649
but I thought I was the one
that truly loved Grace.

24:44.151 --> 24:45.694
Until I heard Edgar's vows.

24:46.195 --> 24:50.073
- Oh, damn it!
- Aniq, that was incredibly loud.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.201
Ladies and gentlemen, the vow box.
My apologies.

24:55.454 --> 24:58.665
I know I'm stuck in my ways,
but Grace, when I look at you,

24:59.708 --> 25:05.005
my dopamine levels go from 16% to 37%.

25:05.797 --> 25:10.219
Norepinephrine from 12% to 26%.

25:10.928 --> 25:14.348
And the oxytocin rises to levels
I've never known before,

25:14.973 --> 25:17.809
23.2%.

25:17.809 --> 25:20.896
These are unprecedented moves.

25:20.896 --> 25:24.691
<i>It was the most raw emotion
her brother had shown in his entire life.</i>

25:25.192 --> 25:26.902
<i>She knew there was no denying it.</i>

25:26.902 --> 25:28.987
<i>Edgar was deeply in love with Grace.</i>

25:30.531 --> 25:32.157
<i>And that meant they both loved her.</i>

25:33.075 --> 25:34.701
<i>But they couldn't both be with her.</i>

25:34.701 --> 25:36.328
<i>One of them would have to be alone.</i>

25:37.204 --> 25:38.830
<i>Hannah decided it would be her.</i>

25:39.623 --> 25:41.291
It's a glandular typhoon.

25:42.543 --> 25:45.838
Okay, folks, now let's
get one that's just the wedding party.

25:52.928 --> 25:54.346
My brother really loves you.

25:55.097 --> 25:56.098
I know.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.141
Good.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.769
I'm really happy for you.

26:06.942 --> 26:09.194
<i>Hannah decided it would be far too painful</i>

26:09.194 --> 26:10.737
<i>to see them together every day.</i>

26:10.737 --> 26:13.115
<i>So, she booked passage on an ocean liner.</i>

26:18.120 --> 26:20.080
<i>Hannah would spend a year at sea.</i>

26:24.168 --> 26:26.545
<i>But there was one more thing
she needed to do.</i>

26:51.236 --> 26:54.406
I see Sebastian is throwing back
an entire bottle of Shackleton.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.079
He's having a rough day.

27:01.663 --> 27:02.497
A toast.

27:06.585 --> 27:07.586
To you...

27:09.129 --> 27:09.963
and Grace.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.054
I have something for you.

27:30.067 --> 27:31.777
Well, it's very thoughtful,

27:31.777 --> 27:34.821
but won't this
make your typewriter unusable?

27:36.114 --> 27:39.451
There'll be hundreds of thousands of words
you'll never be able to spell.

27:40.786 --> 27:41.912
Dungarees.

27:42.788 --> 27:44.122
Frigate.

27:44.122 --> 27:45.290
Gigolo.

27:45.290 --> 27:48.085
If you wanna write about
a gargantuan gigolo,

27:48.085 --> 27:49.711
you're gonna be in a real fix.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.129
You've been very kind to me.

27:51.880 --> 27:55.175
Treating me like a sister
even when I'm not.

27:56.176 --> 27:57.553
I'm returning the kindness.

27:58.971 --> 28:01.765
And also, I'm moving out.

28:02.266 --> 28:03.517
Effective immediately.

28:03.517 --> 28:09.106
So... goodbye, Edgar.

28:11.358 --> 28:13.819
Well, it would be, "Oodbye, Edar."

28:19.950 --> 28:22.870
Oopsie-daisy. Be careful.
Someone's a little bit drunk.

28:29.168 --> 28:30.169
Bye.

28:33.755 --> 28:34.590
Fin.

28:34.590 --> 28:37.092
Wha-- Really? That's the end?

28:37.676 --> 28:42.222
Most people, when they tell their stories,
they try to refute their motives.

28:42.222 --> 28:44.516
Yours is just all motive.

28:44.516 --> 28:46.768
Okay. Well, I didn't kill my brother.

28:46.768 --> 28:49.813
Yeah, well, he was poisoned
with flowers from your garden

28:50.314 --> 28:51.565
and the last thing you did--

28:51.565 --> 28:53.775
Was run into Sebastian,
who was sad and drunk.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.069
But why would Sebastian be sad?

28:56.069 --> 28:59.489
Well, when he came here on Friday
just wanting me so bad,

28:59.489 --> 29:02.743
he said,
"You're losing a brother. I'm losing a--"

29:02.743 --> 29:04.786
"...a business partner."
Yeah, no, I remember.

29:05.287 --> 29:07.873
But you don't lose a business partner
because of a marriage. Y--

29:09.416 --> 29:11.502
Holy shit!

29:12.002 --> 29:13.212
Wait! Where are you going?

29:13.212 --> 29:15.088
Damn! I gotta follow him.

29:15.088 --> 29:18.300
Hold up. Now that your brother's at rest,

29:19.134 --> 29:20.636
at peace if you will,

29:21.512 --> 29:24.014
you think
you're gonna try to get Grace back?

29:25.641 --> 29:28.644
I don't know.
We're both very upset right now.

29:29.520 --> 29:30.896
I feel like you do know.

29:32.189 --> 29:33.398
Wait a minute, fool!

29:39.279 --> 29:42.491
You're really gonna make me chase you
all over this damn estate?

29:43.033 --> 29:44.243
I'm looking for something.

29:45.285 --> 29:48.497
Does it have anything to do
with this SEC4 thing?

29:48.497 --> 29:50.207
No. I still don't know
what to make of that.

29:50.207 --> 29:51.750
And it's all just making me nuts.

29:59.424 --> 30:00.425
I knew it.

30:02.010 --> 30:03.887
These aren't cover identities.

30:03.887 --> 30:06.265
They're candidates
from an executive headhunter.

30:06.265 --> 30:08.350
Edgar was looking
for a new business partner.

30:08.350 --> 30:10.310
Because he fired Sebastian.

30:10.310 --> 30:12.062
Damn, you good.

30:12.062 --> 30:13.730
Well, thank you. It's--

30:13.730 --> 30:16.817
But wait, if Edgar fired Sebastian,

30:16.817 --> 30:20.112
why is he on the phone making calls
like he still works for the company?

30:20.112 --> 30:21.405
Because no one knew.

30:23.490 --> 30:25.409
Yes, things are moving very quickly.

30:26.076 --> 30:27.911
That's why Edgar and I
wanna get this done.

30:29.705 --> 30:31.957
Of course. I'll just go get him.

30:36.962 --> 30:39.298
Hello. This is Edgar Minnows.

30:41.049 --> 30:42.050
Yes.

30:42.551 --> 30:45.929
Sebastian Drapewood has my full authority.
