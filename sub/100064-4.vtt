17:34.240 --> 17:36.220
blood before she was locked up.

17:36.230 --> 17:37.230
My blood?

17:37.240 --> 17:38.230
It's ok.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.000
I trust her.

17:40.009 --> 17:43.180
I got a feeling whatever she

17:40.009 --> 17:43.180
found out is why she's in here.

17:43.190 --> 17:45.200
Oh, look. This is it.

17:45.210 --> 17:47.170
Oh no.

17:49.220 --> 17:50.259
Where is she?

17:50.269 --> 17:53.059
Not your concern.

17:53.069 --> 17:55.039
Take my daughter

17:53.069 --> 17:55.039
to her quarters.

17:55.049 --> 17:56.269
Dad, Julius didn't do

17:55.049 --> 17:56.269
anything wrong.

17:56.279 --> 17:58.279
We'll talk about that later.

18:02.259 --> 18:04.210
Where the hell is Doc?

18:04.220 --> 18:07.009
Where troublemakers go

18:04.220 --> 18:07.009
to learn their place.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.259
I swear to god, if you hurt her

18:07.019 --> 18:08.259
I will rip your-

18:08.269 --> 18:12.259
You'll do nothing.

18:12.269 --> 18:16.000
Violet's taken to you and you

18:12.269 --> 18:16.000
care for her and I see that.

18:16.009 --> 18:18.059
It's what I hoped for.

18:18.069 --> 18:20.019
But I can't have you

18:18.069 --> 18:20.019
filling her head

18:20.029 --> 18:22.099
with mythical stories

18:20.029 --> 18:22.099
and nonsense.

18:22.109 --> 18:25.019
We both know who she really is.

18:27.269 --> 18:29.079
What happened to my daughter?

18:29.089 --> 18:30.170
Ask her.

18:30.180 --> 18:32.039
I'm asking you.

18:32.230 --> 18:33.240
Nothing.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.210
Is that why my men found

18:33.250 --> 18:35.210
the bodies of two vampires

18:35.220 --> 18:37.009
in a dumpster?

18:37.019 --> 18:39.059
What happened?!

18:41.029 --> 18:43.019
They attacked us.

18:43.029 --> 18:44.210
And we handled it.

18:44.220 --> 18:47.180
Isn't that what you wanted?

18:47.190 --> 18:50.250
You said we both knew

18:47.190 --> 18:50.250
who she is.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.190
What'd you mean by that?

18:52.200 --> 18:53.220
[laughs]

18:53.230 --> 18:54.200
Come on.

18:54.210 --> 18:57.000
Now look who's playing dumb.

18:57.279 --> 18:59.089
Hmm.

18:59.099 --> 19:03.109
[choking]

19:23.119 --> 19:25.230
[door closes]

19:33.079 --> 19:34.200
Can I come in, Vi?

19:34.210 --> 19:37.240
It's not like I can stop you,

19:34.210 --> 19:37.240
anyway.

19:37.250 --> 19:39.250
Alright, then I'll cut

19:37.250 --> 19:39.250
right to it.

19:39.259 --> 19:42.069
What were you and Julius doing

19:39.259 --> 19:42.069
in the detention area?

19:42.079 --> 19:43.269
He wanted to see his friend.

19:43.279 --> 19:45.240
And you thought you could

19:43.279 --> 19:45.240
help him with that?

19:45.250 --> 19:47.220
Well, why was she there

19:45.250 --> 19:47.220
in the first place?

19:47.230 --> 19:49.220
You know, this whole Julius

19:47.230 --> 19:49.220
thing was a mistake.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.250
I brought him in because I

19:49.230 --> 19:51.250
thought he'd make you stronger,

19:51.259 --> 19:55.000
but instead I hear about the two

19:51.259 --> 19:55.000
of you sneaking into Low Town,

19:55.009 --> 19:56.269
putting yourselves at risk.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.279
It's not his fault.

20:00.250 --> 20:06.039
Ever since the rising my primary

20:00.250 --> 20:06.039
goal is to protect you.

20:06.049 --> 20:07.079
Keeping me locked

20:06.049 --> 20:07.079
in this compound.

20:07.089 --> 20:08.079
Yes.

20:08.089 --> 20:09.099
That's for my protection?

20:09.109 --> 20:10.150
Yes!

20:10.160 --> 20:12.039
Because I wasn't gonna let

20:10.160 --> 20:12.039
what happened to your sister

20:12.049 --> 20:13.269
happen to you!

20:21.119 --> 20:23.000
You know what?

20:26.069 --> 20:32.000
Yes, I've probably been

20:26.069 --> 20:32.000
a little... overprotective.

20:32.009 --> 20:34.079
That's why I had you train,

20:32.009 --> 20:34.079
so you'd be ready.

20:34.089 --> 20:36.130
Ready for what, exactly?

20:36.140 --> 20:38.059
For anything.

20:38.069 --> 20:41.039
For everything.

20:41.049 --> 20:42.269
Look, I've made some mistakes

20:41.049 --> 20:42.269
and there are things

20:42.279 --> 20:47.210
that I wish had gone differently

20:42.279 --> 20:47.210
but you, Violet,

20:47.220 --> 20:53.059
I wish I could tell you

20:47.220 --> 20:53.059
how important you are to me.

21:23.039 --> 21:25.240
Tell me about my parents.

21:26.289 --> 21:28.079
What's that?

21:28.089 --> 21:31.109
Tell me about my parents.

21:31.119 --> 21:33.150
Oh, come on Violet.

21:33.160 --> 21:38.069
I've told you that

21:33.160 --> 21:38.069
a thousand times.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.289
Make it a thousand and one.

21:43.099 --> 21:45.279
[laughs]

21:47.170 --> 21:49.000
Ok.

21:54.019 --> 21:57.160
They both had brilliant minds

21:57.170 --> 22:02.119
with this desire to make

21:57.170 --> 22:02.119
the world a better place.

22:02.130 --> 22:06.029
We became such close friends.

22:06.039 --> 22:10.170
So much so that they

22:06.039 --> 22:10.170
made me your guardian,

22:10.180 --> 22:17.049
just in case something terrible

22:10.180 --> 22:17.049
happened and it did.

22:17.059 --> 22:20.029
After the accident

22:20.039 --> 22:23.140
the doctors did everything

22:20.039 --> 22:23.140
they could to save them.

22:26.049 --> 22:29.049
I made them a promise.

22:29.059 --> 22:33.250
That I would take care of you.

22:33.259 --> 22:37.140
I failed with your sister.

22:37.150 --> 22:41.029
I am not going to fail with you.

22:55.170 --> 22:58.039
You trust me, right?

22:59.200 --> 23:01.250
Good.

23:01.259 --> 23:04.019
Something you wanna tell me?

23:05.109 --> 23:07.000
No.

23:08.069 --> 23:09.190
Ok.

24:04.089 --> 24:06.190
I know you're there.

24:09.119 --> 24:12.049
It doesn't have to be

24:09.119 --> 24:12.049
this way.

24:13.140 --> 24:18.170
[gun shots]

24:32.180 --> 24:35.150
Ain't no other way it can be.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.200
Go on then.

24:44.210 --> 24:48.230
I told you the next time

24:44.210 --> 24:48.230
I saw you I'd kill you.

24:49.180 --> 24:53.019
Axel, listen.

24:55.150 --> 24:58.069
[groans]

25:11.039 --> 25:12.230
Shit.

25:14.109 --> 25:16.109
I don't want to hurt you,

25:14.109 --> 25:16.109
Axel.

25:16.119 --> 25:19.079
A little late for that now,

25:16.119 --> 25:19.079
Sleeping Beauty.

25:21.119 --> 25:23.200
Why hide now, huh?

25:23.210 --> 25:25.150
What's the matter,

25:23.210 --> 25:25.150
you lose your edge?

25:25.160 --> 25:27.130
What happened to that

25:25.160 --> 25:27.130
blood lust?

25:27.140 --> 25:29.180
I've changed, Axel.

25:29.190 --> 25:31.140
Yeah, me too.

25:31.150 --> 25:34.049
The second you put that blade

25:31.150 --> 25:34.049
in her heart.

25:34.059 --> 25:36.140
You're supposed to be the answer

25:34.059 --> 25:36.140
to all this, you know.

25:36.150 --> 25:38.109
An end to all the misery

25:36.150 --> 25:38.109
and the pain.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.119
I still can be.

25:40.130 --> 25:41.170
How're you gonna do that?

25:41.180 --> 25:43.059
You gonna bring her back?

25:43.069 --> 25:44.029
Huh?

25:44.039 --> 25:47.140
You gonna bring

25:44.039 --> 25:47.140
all of them back?

25:47.150 --> 25:49.259
No, this is the way

25:47.150 --> 25:49.259
it's gotta be.

25:49.269 --> 25:53.039
Killing me won't stop

25:49.269 --> 25:53.039
the pain.

25:53.049 --> 25:54.160
Let's give it a shot.

25:54.170 --> 25:58.140
[gun fire]

26:05.150 --> 26:08.039
Can't hide from me forever.

26:08.049 --> 26:10.049
Only one of us is gonna

26:08.049 --> 26:10.049
walk away from here.

26:10.059 --> 26:11.220
[gun fire]

26:12.220 --> 26:14.079
[gun fire]

26:14.089 --> 26:15.210
[click]

26:20.279 --> 26:22.230
You ready to talk?

26:22.240 --> 26:25.109
Yeah, sure.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.109
Come on.

26:25.119 --> 26:26.250
Let's talk.

26:27.140 --> 26:29.079
I'm sorry, Axel.

26:29.089 --> 26:30.140
Save it.

26:32.160 --> 26:36.049
[fighting grunts]

26:40.220 --> 26:42.150
[groans]

26:53.140 --> 26:55.039
You finished?

26:55.049 --> 27:00.140
[panting]

27:00.150 --> 27:01.210
You're gonna have

27:00.150 --> 27:01.210
to kill me.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.210
I won't do that.

27:03.220 --> 27:05.220
You're not the only one

27:03.220 --> 27:05.220
who lost her, Axel.

27:05.230 --> 27:07.220
Lost her? You took her!

27:07.230 --> 27:09.220
Scarlett knew the choice

27:07.230 --> 27:09.220
she was making.

27:09.230 --> 27:11.259
Don't you say her name.

27:19.140 --> 27:22.180
She thought she was making

27:19.140 --> 27:22.180
the right choice.

27:22.190 --> 27:27.049
She was your sister.

27:27.059 --> 27:28.180
You're supposed to protect her.

27:28.190 --> 27:30.069
I tried.

27:30.079 --> 27:31.289
I left her on that island

27:30.079 --> 27:31.289
for a reason.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.230
She was never supposed to be

27:32.000 --> 27:33.230
in that maze!

27:33.240 --> 27:35.119
You could have talked her

27:33.240 --> 27:35.119
out of it!

27:35.130 --> 27:37.170
I tried, you know I did!

27:38.250 --> 27:41.130
[fighting grunts]

27:43.130 --> 27:46.069
I'm not gonna hurt you.

27:46.079 --> 27:48.130
You kill everyone

27:46.079 --> 27:48.130
you get close to.

27:48.140 --> 27:50.210
Why should I be any different?

27:50.220 --> 27:52.099
[groans]

27:52.109 --> 27:54.289
All I ever tried to do

27:52.109 --> 27:54.289
was to protect her.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.059
To protect Dylan.

27:58.069 --> 27:59.250
I've lost everything.

27:59.259 --> 28:01.109
Yeah, well-

28:01.119 --> 28:02.259
Including you!

28:02.269 --> 28:04.130
The one person in this

28:02.269 --> 28:04.130
up world

28:04.140 --> 28:06.220
that was supposed to have

28:04.140 --> 28:06.220
my back!

28:09.069 --> 28:15.069
I've accepted the losses, and

28:09.069 --> 28:15.069
what it gave me was purpose.

28:17.190 --> 28:20.130
[groans]

28:20.140 --> 28:22.220
Axel! Axel!

28:23.230 --> 28:26.289
[groans]

28:27.000 --> 28:28.170
No, no, no! Don't do that!

28:28.180 --> 28:30.000
[groaning]

28:30.009 --> 28:31.140
Axel.

28:38.130 --> 28:40.150
Another curse, thanks to you.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.109
[grunting]

28:46.000 --> 28:48.109
So this is it, huh?

28:48.119 --> 28:51.000
How this all ends?

28:51.009 --> 28:52.240
I guess so.

28:55.130 --> 28:58.000
You're gonna cut off my head?

28:59.220 --> 29:03.269
Killing me would be killing

28:59.220 --> 29:03.269
what she sacrificed herself for.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.019
you.

29:18.279 --> 29:20.099
you, too.

29:20.109 --> 29:23.019
[sobbing]

29:41.210 --> 29:44.240
You know, I can't ever really

29:41.210 --> 29:44.240
forgive you for her death.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.289
You know that.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.259
I do.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.289
So what now?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.160
Keep moving forward.

29:55.170 --> 29:56.289
Find a purpose.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.019
I can't come with you this time,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.019
you know that.

29:59.029 --> 30:01.009
I need to do this on my own,

29:59.029 --> 30:01.009
anyway.

30:01.019 --> 30:06.160
Destiny or fate, or whatever

30:01.019 --> 30:06.160
your crazy family calls it?

30:06.170 --> 30:09.000
You really believe

30:06.170 --> 30:09.000
all that crap?

30:09.009 --> 30:11.160
This is all some

30:09.009 --> 30:11.160
preordained plan?

30:11.170 --> 30:13.009
I didn't used to.

30:13.019 --> 30:15.160
Now it's all I have.

30:15.170 --> 30:18.069
Well, I ain't gonna be

30:15.170 --> 30:18.069
destiny's pawn.

30:19.220 --> 30:22.000
I'm gonna choose my own path.

30:23.210 --> 30:26.000
Where does that take you?

30:26.009 --> 30:29.220
Back to something I should

30:26.009 --> 30:29.220
have done right the first time.

30:34.230 --> 30:37.170
So this is it?

30:37.180 --> 30:40.089
This the end?

30:40.099 --> 30:42.269
It doesn't have to be.

30:50.170 --> 30:51.140
What's this?

30:51.150 --> 30:53.240
If you ever need me,

30:51.150 --> 30:53.240
follow it.

30:53.250 --> 30:55.269
You'll find me.

31:11.210 --> 31:14.099
Vanessa, what I did-

31:14.109 --> 31:17.039
I know.

31:17.049 --> 31:20.079
Take care of yourself.

31:20.089 --> 31:23.069
You too, Sleeping Beauty.

31:36.049 --> 31:38.190
Since there's nobody here

31:36.049 --> 31:38.190
to card shark,

31:38.200 --> 31:41.039
you gonna tell me what

31:38.200 --> 31:41.039
you're doing here now?

31:41.049 --> 31:45.190
Okay, so you remember how

31:41.049 --> 31:45.190
we always talked about

31:45.200 --> 31:48.190
getting out of here

31:45.200 --> 31:48.190
and finding that coyote?

31:48.200 --> 31:51.230
Ah, the one that's supposed

31:48.200 --> 31:51.230
to get people to Hawaii?

31:51.240 --> 31:54.210
Well, pipe dreams are better

31:51.240 --> 31:54.210
than no dreams, right?

31:54.220 --> 31:56.000
[clink]

31:58.000 --> 31:58.250
Mmm.

32:02.069 --> 32:04.079
What if it wasn't just

32:02.069 --> 32:04.079
a pipe dream?

32:04.089 --> 32:05.210
What do you mean?

32:05.220 --> 32:07.180
I mean let's go.

32:07.190 --> 32:09.230
Tonight, you know?

32:09.240 --> 32:11.000
I need out, Lee.

32:11.009 --> 32:12.200
Beyond these goddamn walls.

32:12.210 --> 32:14.079
You have no idea what

32:12.210 --> 32:14.079
it's really like out there.

32:14.089 --> 32:17.019
But we always talked about

32:14.089 --> 32:17.019
an escape.

32:17.029 --> 32:18.089
An adventure.

32:18.099 --> 32:20.240
Why?

32:20.250 --> 32:22.230
What's going on?

32:24.079 --> 32:26.029
[sighs]

32:27.049 --> 32:30.210
I'm not who you think

32:27.049 --> 32:30.210
I am anymore, Lee.

32:30.220 --> 32:33.190
Something's happened.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.089
I've changed.

32:35.099 --> 32:37.049
You've changed how?

32:41.230 --> 32:44.289
I've been having these dreams.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.019
A place, a woman.

32:49.029 --> 32:50.269
It's like she's drawing

32:49.029 --> 32:50.269
me somewhere.

32:50.279 --> 32:55.000
It's like she's-

32:50.279 --> 32:55.000
she's tugging at me.

32:55.009 --> 33:00.210
I know it sounds crazy

32:55.009 --> 33:00.210
but I need to find her.

33:00.220 --> 33:03.009
And I want you to come

33:00.220 --> 33:03.009
with me.

33:03.019 --> 33:08.099
Uh... Violet, it's not

33:03.019 --> 33:08.099
that simple.

33:08.109 --> 33:13.019
I can't just up and leave for

33:08.109 --> 33:13.019
some dreams you've been having.

33:17.009 --> 33:18.259
Then I guess this is goodbye.

33:18.269 --> 33:20.109
Wait, seriously?

33:22.109 --> 33:24.029
Violet!

33:38.230 --> 33:42.130
[weak cries]

33:58.009 --> 34:01.089
Ivory, my sister.

34:01.099 --> 34:03.109
How I've missed you.

34:03.119 --> 34:05.279
And I you, mother.

34:05.289 --> 34:08.030
Rise my child.

34:13.159 --> 34:16.219
Where are the others?

34:16.230 --> 34:18.230
This is all, mother.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.280
This is all?

34:25.099 --> 34:26.230
[slap]

34:28.110 --> 34:30.130
I left you with an army

34:28.110 --> 34:30.130
and you are telling me

34:30.139 --> 34:33.030
this is all that is left?

34:33.039 --> 34:36.280
I'm sorry, mother, but a lot

34:33.039 --> 34:36.280
has transpired since you-

34:36.289 --> 34:38.130
Silence.

34:42.099 --> 34:45.030
Hmm.

34:45.039 --> 34:47.159
I knew I smelled

34:45.039 --> 34:47.159
something rotten.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.280
We have no time

34:47.170 --> 34:49.280
for petty grudges.

34:49.289 --> 34:51.079
Petty?

34:51.090 --> 34:56.139
Your lies and deception

34:51.090 --> 34:56.139
had me locked away.

34:56.150 --> 34:59.019
Over two centuries,

34:56.150 --> 34:59.019
mother.

35:00.150 --> 35:03.150
I will relish placing your head

35:00.150 --> 35:03.150
upon a pike.

35:03.159 --> 35:05.269
You should be thanking me.

35:05.280 --> 35:10.219
Our kind was nearly hunted

35:05.280 --> 35:10.219
to extinction during your rest.

35:10.230 --> 35:12.030
Oh.

35:12.039 --> 35:14.289
I am in your debt, Bathory.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.030
Oh, I like her.

35:22.150 --> 35:24.039
Where is the Dark One?

35:24.050 --> 35:26.260
Still exiled by the Van Helsing.

35:26.269 --> 35:28.099
[laughs]

35:28.110 --> 35:29.269
Of course.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.239
You freed me

35:29.280 --> 35:31.239
because you need me.

35:31.250 --> 35:34.039
Our beloved needs all of us.

35:34.050 --> 35:36.010
Our beloved?

35:45.030 --> 35:47.130
And who is this?

35:47.139 --> 35:52.000
This is the fourth.

36:04.010 --> 36:08.070
He is not worthy to breathe

36:04.010 --> 36:08.070
the same air as the Dark One.

36:09.059 --> 36:11.010
[gasps]

36:12.070 --> 36:17.179
[sing-songy]

36:12.070 --> 36:17.179
Sam I am.

36:17.190 --> 36:22.070
You will learn to love me.

36:25.000 --> 36:30.059
There is no measure to the depth

36:25.000 --> 36:30.059
of his darkness.

36:30.070 --> 36:33.019
Or his stupidity.

36:58.139 --> 37:03.119
You killed innocents

36:58.139 --> 37:03.119
for pleasure.

37:03.130 --> 37:06.079
Is anyone truly innocent?

37:09.190 --> 37:14.139
A creator of so much pain

37:09.190 --> 37:14.139
and anguish.

37:14.150 --> 37:16.289
I've only just begun.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.190
Oh...

37:20.090 --> 37:23.210
The days of games are over.

37:23.219 --> 37:30.139
The mouse is dead and love

37:23.219 --> 37:30.139
died at your hand.

37:32.050 --> 37:41.010
Yes. I killed love to embrace

37:32.050 --> 37:41.010
the darkness.

37:41.019 --> 37:45.150
You know less of darkness

37:41.019 --> 37:45.150
than you realize,

37:45.159 --> 37:51.000
but you will understand

37:45.159 --> 37:51.000
soon enough.

38:08.179 --> 38:10.110
Wonderful.

38:10.119 --> 38:13.059
You will do just fine.

38:13.070 --> 38:15.110
Simply wonderful.

38:19.099 --> 38:21.179
We leave tonight.

38:21.190 --> 38:25.019
It is time to unite the brides.

38:27.059 --> 38:34.219
[hysterical laughing]

38:54.260 --> 38:55.250
Let's go.

38:55.260 --> 38:56.260
Turn around, on your knees.

38:56.269 --> 38:57.239
What's this?

38:57.250 --> 38:59.000
You're being moved.

38:59.010 --> 39:00.000
To where?

39:00.010 --> 39:02.099
To none of your goddamn

39:00.010 --> 39:02.099
business, that's where.

39:02.110 --> 39:04.179
Now turn around

39:02.110 --> 39:04.179
and get on your knees.

39:04.190 --> 39:06.150
Sure.

There's a group at the gate

What am I, the welcome

that happened

I've had this feeling

42:12.019 --> 42:14.150
of something like...

42:14.159 --> 42:17.050
pulling me towards...
