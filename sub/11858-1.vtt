00:03.417 --> 00:04.959
<i>Family massacre, the Jacobis.</i>

00:05.041 --> 00:07.750
<i>Mom, dad and son</i>

00:07.834 --> 00:10.083
<i>The daughter survived</i>
<i>a bullet to the head.</i>

00:10.166 --> 00:11.667
- I remember.
- Who is he?

00:11.750 --> 00:13.166
(male #1)
'You're not gonna
take her from me.'

00:13.250 --> 00:14.417
'Not again.'

00:14.500 --> 00:16.125
- Hey!
- I'll kill all of you.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.208
'You're coming too.'

00:20.291 --> 00:22.291
<i>(Rush)</i>
<i>I'm going.</i>

00:22.375 --> 00:24.500
- You're gonna die.
- Shoot me! Do it now!

00:36.834 --> 00:37.917
Pop says we're
not supposed to go

00:38.000 --> 00:39.375
past Mrs. Mortenson's house.

00:39.458 --> 00:41.542
- Who cares what your pop says?
- No, serious.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.291
He'll blow a gasket
if we go to the pool again.

00:43.375 --> 00:46.625
So what are we gonna do?
Hang out here in Snoozerville?

00:46.709 --> 00:49.041
He said a kid just got
beat up really bad in
Fishtown.

00:51.792 --> 00:53.875
Jackie's gonna go
wee-wee in his diaper.

00:53.959 --> 00:55.375
- Scaredy cat.
- Shut up, man.

00:55.458 --> 00:56.792
I ain't scared.

00:58.375 --> 01:00.458
So what are you
waiting for, wusses?

01:00.542 --> 01:03.959
- Alright.
- To the pool.

01:47.333 --> 01:50.500
(female on TV)
'Fishtown teenagers
Dylan Noakes and Teddy Nimmo'

01:50.583 --> 01:52.458
'were convicted today
in the brutal deaths'

01:52.542 --> 01:54.333
'of three local
fifth-grade boys.'

01:54.417 --> 01:56.917
'Nimmo was the only one
to confess to the crime'

01:57.000 --> 02:00.166
'calling it a "Thrill Kill."'

03:06.083 --> 03:08.291
Look who bothered
coming to work.

03:10.250 --> 03:11.208
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.000
- Hey.
- What's going on?

03:13.083 --> 03:14.333
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

03:14.417 --> 03:16.750
They...they just
took the stitches
out.

03:16.834 --> 03:18.917
- Ah.
- It's nothing. I'm fine.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.583
- You look good, Lil.
- You do.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.750
- The city's going all out,
huh?
- Yeah.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.166
(Miller)
'Take a bullet, think
they'd give you more'

03:26.250 --> 03:27.625
than a Mickey Mouse band-aid.

03:27.709 --> 03:31.125
I didn't stop them from
siccing IAD on our asses.

03:31.208 --> 03:33.333
(Jeffries)
'Protocol said
he's got to dot the "I's"'

03:33.417 --> 03:36.458
cross the "T's,"
prove it was a good shooting.

03:36.542 --> 03:38.792
So, uh, you ready to jump back
in the saddle here or what?

03:43.750 --> 03:45.375
(Vera)
'Bunch of nervous nellies.'

03:46.709 --> 03:49.709
- Need a refill.
- Second that.

03:49.792 --> 03:52.875
- Uh, get you anything, Lil?
- No, no, I'm good. Thanks.

03:52.959 --> 03:54.583
(female #1)
'Are you detectives?'

03:54.667 --> 03:58.583
- You need something?
- You people killed my son.

03:58.667 --> 03:59.917
Teddy.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.709
Teddy Nimmo.

04:01.792 --> 04:04.625
Welcome back, Lil.

04:04.709 --> 04:06.000
I heard about that job.

04:06.083 --> 04:08.041
(Rush)
'Your son and his buddy
did a triple back'

04:08.125 --> 04:09.792
'in '93, '94.'

04:09.875 --> 04:11.750
We put him away,
lady, we didn't kill him.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.667
Might as well have. Teddy hung
himself.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.959
They gave me
his stuff from the
cell.

04:18.041 --> 04:19.667
I found this letter.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.125
"I tape their eyes shut

04:27.208 --> 04:29.458
'"so they stay in
the dark forever.'

04:29.542 --> 04:31.125
"Just like me.

04:31.208 --> 04:33.291
"Stop me. I am the monster."

04:33.375 --> 04:35.500
Must have been the real
killer that sent him that
letter

04:35.583 --> 04:36.709
when they first locked him up.

04:36.792 --> 04:39.041
Oh, should've
given it to his lawyer.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.959
Yeah? Teddy
tried.
Again and again.

04:42.041 --> 04:44.792
I just talked to that
jackass.
He never listened.

04:44.875 --> 04:45.959
Maybe 'cause your son wrote it.

04:46.041 --> 04:48.083
Ain't
possible.
Believe me.

04:48.166 --> 04:49.875
We're not gonna
just take your word.

04:49.959 --> 04:53.500
My boy, uh, he couldn't write.

04:54.333 --> 04:55.500
'He could barely read.'

04:55.583 --> 04:56.917
They said he was a monster

04:57.000 --> 04:59.208
because he used
to smile at the
trial.

04:59.291 --> 05:01.583
'That's what Teddy
does when he's scared.'

05:01.667 --> 05:03.542
He smiles.

05:03.625 --> 05:06.834
My son, he wouldn't hurt a soul.

05:09.125 --> 05:12.250
We'll look into it, Mrs. Nimmo.

05:12.333 --> 05:13.875
No, you won't.

05:13.959 --> 05:16.625
We're just
Fishtown trash,
right?

05:18.083 --> 05:20.041
People like us..

05:20.125 --> 05:21.750
...we don't matter.

05:23.041 --> 05:25.667
(Valens)
'It's a real class act
there.'

05:25.750 --> 05:28.834
No, cops never
released
that detail to the
public.

05:28.917 --> 05:31.375
Doer taping
the dead kids' eyes
shut.

05:31.458 --> 05:32.709
Well, he had
an accomplice, right?

05:32.792 --> 05:33.875
Maybe that guy wrote it.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.917
Well, then who mailed it?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.875
Postmark's from Philly.

05:37.959 --> 05:41.250
His buddy's doing
life up in Graterford.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.208
Could be worth another look.

05:43.291 --> 05:46.291
Could be a wild-goose chase.

05:46.375 --> 05:47.709
And it's closed.

05:47.792 --> 05:49.667
Well, if the killer's
still out there..

05:49.750 --> 05:52.291
...it's not.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.500
(Valens)
'The victims were
last seen on their bikes'

06:31.583 --> 06:33.083
'outside the Raymes residence.'

06:33.166 --> 06:35.041
Bodies found a day later.

06:35.125 --> 06:37.709
(Rush)
Ran into the doers
at the abandoned
pool.

06:37.792 --> 06:39.041
Dylan and Teddy's "hangout."

06:39.125 --> 06:40.792
Cause of death,
blunt force trauma.

06:40.875 --> 06:44.000
Multiple blows
to the skull, the face.

06:44.083 --> 06:46.375
Murder weapon never found.

06:46.458 --> 06:48.333
Criminal
psychologist
said the scene

06:48.417 --> 06:50.667
"Reflected the
frenzied,
explosive rage

06:50.750 --> 06:53.166
"of a severely
disturbed
and abused child."

06:53.250 --> 06:55.792
Or two of them.

06:55.875 --> 06:59.166
Teddy, raised by
a crack head single mom.

06:59.250 --> 07:03.291
Dylan, bumped around the foster
care system since age five.

07:03.375 --> 07:04.667
History of abuse

07:04.750 --> 07:06.208
petty crime,
setting fires.

07:06.291 --> 07:09.291
(Stillman)
On the stand, Dylan
called himself a
"Nihilist."

07:09.375 --> 07:10.667
No beliefs,
no loyalties

07:10.750 --> 07:12.709
no purpose in
life
but destruction.

07:12.792 --> 07:13.875
I didn't know you
worked this job.

07:13.959 --> 07:14.834
'I didn't.'

07:14.917 --> 07:15.834
This kind of massacre

07:15.917 --> 07:16.834
everyone knew about it

07:16.917 --> 07:20.083
wanted answers, blood.

07:20.166 --> 07:21.917
Glad to have you back.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.625
Good to be back, boss.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.500
Start counseling yet?

07:27.583 --> 07:30.542
Not yet. I...will.

07:30.625 --> 07:32.333
Joe Connelly

07:32.417 --> 07:34.291
was the assigned, back in '94.

07:34.375 --> 07:37.166
Thinking we'd have
a talk with Dylan
too.

07:37.250 --> 07:38.333
Teddy confessed

07:38.417 --> 07:40.208
witness at the boys'
school overheard them

07:40.291 --> 07:42.041
bragging about the murders,
what's there to talk about?

07:42.125 --> 07:44.709
The letter, who sent it?
Question Documents has
it.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.875
Maybe they give us some answers.

07:46.959 --> 07:49.458
Joe Connelly was a good cop.

07:49.542 --> 07:51.458
Job's closed.

07:52.834 --> 07:56.166
You got any open
jobs for me,
boss?

07:56.250 --> 07:59.458
Counseling's not
optional here,
Rush.

07:59.542 --> 08:02.333
Get that done first.

08:02.417 --> 08:03.834
Yeah.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.000
I will.

08:08.959 --> 08:12.750
Gotta put in my shrink
hours after that
shooting.

08:12.834 --> 08:14.834
Make sure I'm not nuts.

08:14.917 --> 08:17.709
Gotta be,
to come back to this job.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.291
You know, I, um..

08:23.375 --> 08:25.625
...I never got to say, uh..

08:25.709 --> 08:27.583
...thanks.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.834
For what you did.

08:29.917 --> 08:32.959
I told that IAD jerk
what a hero you were.

08:33.041 --> 08:35.250
As long as you don't
make me do it again.

08:35.333 --> 08:38.583
Okay.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.000
Take a ride up to Graterford?

08:41.083 --> 08:43.875
- Wasting our time.
- Got nothing but, right?

08:43.959 --> 08:45.750
So you comin'?

08:49.750 --> 08:53.041
(Valens)
Found this in your, uh,
buddy's belongings, Dylan.

08:55.125 --> 08:56.458
Nice try.

08:56.542 --> 08:59.000
I didn't write that drivel.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.542
Barely looked at it.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.417
Would you prefer
a handwriting sample?

09:03.500 --> 09:06.125
Save us all this face-to-face?

09:06.208 --> 09:08.709
Heard about what
happened to Teddy yet?

09:11.709 --> 09:13.083
Oh, shocking people

09:13.166 --> 09:14.750
that get you off?

09:14.834 --> 09:17.458
You sure you wanna know
what gets me off, lady?

09:17.542 --> 09:19.291
We're out.
Forget this ass clown.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.625
Locked in a dark room for hours

09:21.709 --> 09:24.542
'your letter writer.'

09:24.625 --> 09:27.792
Little boy blue. Boo-hoo.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.542
You ever locked in
a dark room, Dylan?

09:29.625 --> 09:30.667
I am now.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.250
(Rush)
'All those halfway homes'

09:32.333 --> 09:33.750
'mean foster mommies.'

09:33.834 --> 09:35.709
You must hate the world.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.542
Killing those boys your payback?

09:37.625 --> 09:40.125
Sure.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.542
I'm the fire-breathing dragon

09:41.625 --> 09:44.208
from "Happily Ever After Land."

09:44.291 --> 09:46.166
Nice tat.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.875
I just got it.

09:48.959 --> 09:50.000
You want one?

09:50.083 --> 09:51.750
You didn't answer the question.

09:51.834 --> 09:52.792
You'll believe what you want.

09:52.875 --> 09:54.083
The truth's irrelevant.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.709
Truth being you're
a murdering son of a bitch.

09:55.792 --> 09:58.709
Truth being
we were 17 and
stupid.

09:58.792 --> 10:01.000
- We still believed.
- Believed what?

10:01.083 --> 10:04.041
That they wouldn't put you away
for a crime you didn't commit.

10:07.375 --> 10:08.375
- Here they come.
- Here they are.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.125
How could they
give us life,
Dyl?

10:15.208 --> 10:16.792
We didn't do anything.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.667
Where's my mom?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.542
Mom?

10:27.625 --> 10:29.750
Mom?

10:29.834 --> 10:31.000
(male #2)
'You let my son die!'

10:31.083 --> 10:32.667
I hope they kill you in prison!

10:32.750 --> 10:36.458
Jack!
I want my son back!

10:36.542 --> 10:38.458
Let's give them
what they want then.

10:53.959 --> 10:57.709
Land of the free,
home of the brave.

10:57.792 --> 10:59.792
Guilty for..

10:59.875 --> 11:01.750
...being a freak.

11:01.834 --> 11:04.458
Welcome to the US of A, right?

11:04.542 --> 11:06.000
You're breaking me
up here, homes.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.709
<i>guapo.'</i>

11:07.792 --> 11:10.834
- I'll break you in for
real.
- You promise?

11:12.500 --> 11:14.875
I'm done here.

11:14.959 --> 11:17.583
Attitude like that helped
put you here in the first
place.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.250
Being poor is what put us away.

11:19.333 --> 11:21.834
Not to mention
your buddy's confession.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.959
He was a kid, okay?
Mama's boy.

11:24.041 --> 11:25.250
'No match for that cop.'

11:25.333 --> 11:28.125
Are you saying Connelly
forced Teddy to lie?

11:28.208 --> 11:30.959
Cop forcing a false confession?

11:31.041 --> 11:34.458
No...that never happens.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.166
(Connelly)
That letter is pure BS.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.291
Dylan's a con artist.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.083
Primo sociopath.

11:46.166 --> 11:48.542
Got an IQ of 190.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.792
He's playin' you.

11:51.875 --> 11:53.333
(Jeffries)
'Well, maybe he is.'

11:53.417 --> 11:57.333
- Just doing due diligence,
Joe.
- You saying I blew the job?

11:57.417 --> 11:59.625
I'm just saying
I'm doing mine.

12:02.542 --> 12:06.166
(Connelly)
Takes a while,
beating a person to
death.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.875
(Vera)
The kind of job
that gets to you.

12:07.959 --> 12:09.583
Cost me my marriage.

12:11.375 --> 12:13.041
I hear that.

12:13.125 --> 12:16.917
We searched all night,
and then I found them.

13:16.291 --> 13:20.083
It rained the night
before they were killed.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.709
'There was mud everywhere.'

13:22.792 --> 13:26.166
Think of anything else,
you know where to find
us.

13:26.250 --> 13:29.500
Appreciate your time, Joe.

13:29.583 --> 13:32.041
The night I go to
arrest that punk,
Dylan

13:32.125 --> 13:33.583
'you know what he says?'

13:33.667 --> 13:34.792
What's that?

13:34.875 --> 13:38.000
"Think I'll be on
the news tonight?"

13:38.083 --> 13:41.208
Now you tell me
they didn't do
it.

13:47.208 --> 13:49.375
The guy did his job.
What the hell are we
doing?

13:49.458 --> 13:51.208
Spinning our wheels.

13:51.291 --> 13:53.917
Dylan's handwriting
wasn't a match to the letter.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.625
Ain't what you
call exact
science.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.041
Could have faked it.

13:57.125 --> 13:59.917
Could've got some
prison groupie to write it.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.583
The kid's a genius, right?

14:01.667 --> 14:04.458
No forensics connecting him
to that kind of crime scene?

14:04.542 --> 14:06.792
Come on. And what happened
to the murder weapon?

14:06.875 --> 14:08.041
They dumped it.

14:08.125 --> 14:09.417
Bodies were left where
they're sure to be found

14:09.500 --> 14:11.417
sure to be connected
to Dylan and Teddy

14:11.500 --> 14:13.250
'so why hide the weapon?'

14:13.333 --> 14:14.500
You're reaching, Lil.

14:14.583 --> 14:17.291
And you're reaching
for my kung pao chicken.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.375
It's family style. So what?

14:20.458 --> 14:23.917
Do I look like your family?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.125
Connelly said there was a
storm
the night before the murders.

14:27.208 --> 14:28.333
Mud all over the scene, right?

14:28.417 --> 14:29.417
(Vera)
'Yeah, so what?'

14:29.500 --> 14:30.583
And the kids supposedly

14:30.667 --> 14:33.333
rode their bikes to the pool.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.834
So why no mud in their wheels?

14:38.458 --> 14:41.041
(Miller)
'Squeaky clean,
every one of them.'

14:41.125 --> 14:45.041
When Connelly was tracking,
mud all over the damn place.

14:45.125 --> 14:48.083
Pool wasn't the death scene,
just the dump site.

14:48.166 --> 14:52.083
Somebody carried the boys
there and their bikes.

14:53.041 --> 14:54.959
So where were they killed?

15:04.625 --> 15:06.792
(Stillman)
Thought I told you
this job was closed.

15:06.875 --> 15:09.375
(Rush)
Well, the kids weren't
murdered at the pool.

15:09.458 --> 15:10.667
So?

15:10.750 --> 15:13.375
How'd Dylan and Teddy
transport the bodies?

15:13.458 --> 15:15.834
Didn't own a car,
didn't even have licenses.

15:15.917 --> 15:17.500
They could've stolen
a car to get them.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.667
No vehicle thefts reported
in the vicinity of the pool.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.750
Well, could've carried
them there at night.

15:22.834 --> 15:24.041
No one would have seen 'em.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.500
Okay, sure, so why
go to all that trouble

15:26.583 --> 15:29.959
of putting bodies in
the one spot connected to you?

15:30.041 --> 15:31.917
You're saying
the dump site was a
setup?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.166
Well, bodies were
supposed to be found

15:34.250 --> 15:36.917
pinned on the bad kids
who hung there 24/7.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.375
So where were they killed?

15:39.458 --> 15:41.083
That's what we gotta find out.

15:42.333 --> 15:43.750
You talk to any
of the parents
yet?

15:43.834 --> 15:45.000
Probably knew
their kids'
haunts.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.667
Sean's folks left
the state years ago.

15:46.750 --> 15:47.834
Moved to Oregon.

15:47.917 --> 15:50.208
We reached out
to George's family.

15:50.291 --> 15:51.500
Got shut down.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.834
Oh, that's
understandable.
Job's closed.

15:53.917 --> 15:55.500
Why dig up the worst
memory of your life?

15:55.583 --> 15:58.291
Jack's parents are
still in Fairmont.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.834
His mom was the last to see.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.041
Jeffries and Miller
are having a talk.

16:04.291 --> 16:07.709
Alright, Scotty,
you're the assigned on this
one.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.291
Yeah, sure.

16:18.458 --> 16:20.875
They put those monsters away
and you want to let them go.

16:20.959 --> 16:23.250
That's not what
we're doing, Mr.
Raymes.

16:23.333 --> 16:26.500
We wanted to ask
about some other places

16:26.583 --> 16:28.709
Jack and his friends
might have played.

16:28.792 --> 16:29.834
Why?

16:29.917 --> 16:31.291
We think your
son
and his friends

16:31.375 --> 16:33.583
were killed
elsewhere,
moved to the pool.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.375
Moved?

16:35.458 --> 16:36.542
Oh, my God.

16:36.625 --> 16:38.000
Is this really necessary?

16:38.083 --> 16:40.291
'We just barely got
our lives back together.'

16:40.375 --> 16:42.917
I'm not really sure that my
wife
can go through this again.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.583
I've noticed a lot of empty
factories in the
neighborhood.

16:46.667 --> 16:47.875
Maybe the boys play there?

16:47.959 --> 16:51.250
No. I told Jack to
stay away from those
places.

16:51.333 --> 16:54.625
- Boys will be boys.
- Not Jack, he was a good kid.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.250
He always minded his mom and me

16:56.333 --> 16:59.583
'and he would never've done
anything without telling us.'

16:59.667 --> 17:02.834
Got anything
to add, Mrs. Raymes?

17:05.542 --> 17:07.583
I should have
stopped him from going?

17:07.667 --> 17:09.750
(Jeffries)
'Going where?'

17:09.834 --> 17:11.834
Off the block that day.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.250
(Jack)
'To the pool!'

17:14.333 --> 17:16.125
Jack, where do you think
you're going?

17:18.709 --> 17:21.500
- Nowhere.
- Get over here, mister.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.542
I'm working
the late shift
tonight

17:25.625 --> 17:29.125
so the last thing I need
is you running all over
town.

17:29.208 --> 17:32.625
Oh, Jack, not again
with the wipeouts.

17:32.709 --> 17:34.875
Taking that bike away
if you can't be more
careful.

17:34.959 --> 17:36.083
I am careful, mom.

17:36.166 --> 17:38.125
You've been to that
pool again, haven't
you?

17:38.208 --> 17:40.667
We can do wheelies
and cool stuff there.

17:40.750 --> 17:41.792
'Sean and George will go home'

17:41.875 --> 17:43.625
if we have to
stay in Snoozerville.

17:43.709 --> 17:46.750
And I'll be all alone!

17:46.834 --> 17:48.625
Okay, look, you can
go past Mrs. Mortensen's

17:48.709 --> 17:50.709
if you promise
to stay away from the pool.

17:50.792 --> 17:51.709
Really, mom?

17:51.792 --> 17:52.875
Go on, get out of here

17:52.959 --> 17:55.208
before I change my mind.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.959
You might wanna
zip up your
backpack

17:57.041 --> 17:58.959
'before your buddies
see Little Duke.'

18:01.291 --> 18:03.375
Why are you carrying
him around anyway?

18:05.917 --> 18:08.959
'Cause Little Duke
keeps the dragon away.

18:09.041 --> 18:10.709
The dragon?

18:19.291 --> 18:21.875
Oh, I thought he'd be safe.

18:21.959 --> 18:24.834
I never should have
let him off the block.

18:24.917 --> 18:28.083
Jack mentioned
something about a dragon?

18:28.166 --> 18:30.917
I didn't think anything of it.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.750
Kids imaginations and all.

18:32.834 --> 18:35.667
Jack had that stuffed
animal the day he died?

18:35.750 --> 18:39.166
Police said they never found
it.
Maybe you will?

18:39.250 --> 18:40.750
It was his favorite toy when
he
was a little kid.

18:40.834 --> 18:43.875
He slept with it
curled up in a little ball.

18:43.959 --> 18:46.041
He said it, uh,
"Kept the monsters away."

18:49.000 --> 18:52.458
I mean, not that
he'd ever admit
it.

18:52.542 --> 18:55.917
'He was just
a little boy, okay?'

18:56.000 --> 18:57.875
He was the victim.

18:57.959 --> 18:59.667
Not them.

19:02.458 --> 19:03.834
The dragon.

19:03.917 --> 19:06.875
- Those boys were scared of
you.
- Do you mind?

19:06.959 --> 19:09.458
This ball and chain kind
of makes it hard to converse.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.875
You push them off
their bikes at the
pool?

19:11.959 --> 19:14.041
- Bruise them?
- I scared them.

19:14.125 --> 19:15.583
I never touched them.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.417
Never came up in
the first investigation..

19:17.500 --> 19:18.583
..you bullying them.

19:18.667 --> 19:19.834
If I had told,
it'd give Connelly

19:19.917 --> 19:21.500
more rope to hang me with.

19:21.583 --> 19:22.500
You know that.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.375
You think Connelly set you up?

19:33.208 --> 19:36.417
Three little boys died.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.750
Someone's got to pay.

19:37.834 --> 19:39.375
Like the trash

19:39.458 --> 19:40.917
from the wrong side
of the tracks.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.667
So the whole neighborhood lies?

19:42.750 --> 19:43.709
Just the ones that matter.

19:43.792 --> 19:45.709
The cop,
the wannabe cheerleader.

19:45.792 --> 19:49.375
The star witness who heard
you
take credit for the murders?

19:49.458 --> 19:51.417
- Come on.
- You mean the attention whore?

19:51.500 --> 19:53.417
Year before the trial,
she's running around school

19:53.500 --> 19:55.250
saying that she's got
terminal cancer, right?

19:55.333 --> 19:56.959
And your lawyer
never brought this
up?

19:57.041 --> 19:58.917
I guess it slipped his mind.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.125
'Cause you're nothing but trash.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.417
Did you kill those boys, Dylan?

20:04.500 --> 20:07.583
"Evil triumphs."

20:07.667 --> 20:08.667
You wrote that.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.625
"When good men do nothing."

20:11.709 --> 20:14.166
That's the quote.

20:14.250 --> 20:15.959
"Evil triumphs

20:16.041 --> 20:18.083
"when good men do nothing."

20:20.250 --> 20:21.750
Edmund Burke.

20:24.041 --> 20:26.000
Guess you're not familiar.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.291
'We'll check out that witness.'

20:35.375 --> 20:37.125
But if this is
some kind of
con..

20:37.208 --> 20:38.875
Spent half my life in here.

20:38.959 --> 20:40.959
I'm probably gonna
die in here too.

20:41.041 --> 20:43.041
I'm all out of cons.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.166
I didn't kill those boys.

21:01.834 --> 21:04.333
In court,
you testified Dylan said

21:04.417 --> 21:05.917
quote

21:06.000 --> 21:09.250
"We killed those brats,
bashed
their heads in. It was
fun."

21:09.333 --> 21:11.834
That was a long time ago.

21:11.917 --> 21:13.792
Why does it matter now?

21:13.875 --> 21:15.083
He said you made it up.

21:15.166 --> 21:18.500
And you believe that weirdo?

21:18.583 --> 21:20.917
I found this in
the court records
too.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.500
Restraining order you filed
against your homeroom
teacher.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.709
- Claimed he was stalking you.
- What is this?

21:26.792 --> 21:29.542
Stalking, cancer...I
mean,
help me out here, Heidi

21:29.625 --> 21:30.959
'cause from where I'm sitting

21:31.041 --> 21:33.000
you got a real problem
with fact and fiction.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.542
Everyone said they did it,
even our principal.

21:35.625 --> 21:37.834
Oh, so they must've, right?

21:37.917 --> 21:40.750
Dylan and Teddy
poured pig's blood

21:40.834 --> 21:43.166
in assembly to protest
the Rwandan genocide

21:43.250 --> 21:44.625
or whatever it was called, okay?

21:44.709 --> 21:46.500
They were freaks.

21:47.792 --> 21:48.917
Guess what I heard?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.458
When they found
those little boys

21:50.542 --> 21:53.125
their heads were
like smushed pumpkins.

21:53.208 --> 21:54.834
(in unison)
Eww.

21:54.917 --> 21:58.041
Oh, my God,
freak alert, 12 o'clock.

21:59.125 --> 22:00.000
I thought you'd be dead

22:00.083 --> 22:01.375
from cancer by now, Heidi.

22:01.458 --> 22:03.875
Um, do I even know you?

22:04.917 --> 22:06.875
From second grade, remember?

22:06.959 --> 22:09.542
I popped you
under the jungle gym.

22:12.041 --> 22:14.166
I bet you killed those kids.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.667
Maybe we bash
your head in, bitch.

22:21.041 --> 22:25.166
So, Dylan never actually said

22:25.250 --> 22:26.500
"We killed those brats

22:26.583 --> 22:28.041
"bashed their heads in?"

22:28.125 --> 22:30.875
Teddy confessed
to that cop, right?

22:30.959 --> 22:32.625
What else do you want?

22:35.917 --> 22:39.166
Homegirl basically made it up.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.792
No one questioned her story.

22:41.875 --> 22:43.417
Someone had to pay.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.458
Why not the Fishtown freaks?

22:45.542 --> 22:47.417
House of cards coming down.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.417
- We go back to Connelly?
- And say what?

22:49.500 --> 22:50.750
That your case sucked?

22:50.834 --> 22:52.500
How about
"It's looking like a
cover-up?"

22:52.583 --> 22:54.291
Checked out abandoned
factories in Fairmont.

22:54.375 --> 22:56.375
Complaint came in
the night of the murders.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.959
"Six-foot-five homeless man

22:58.041 --> 23:00.125
'"Caucasian,
spotted in empty lot'

23:00.208 --> 23:02.166
"at the corner of
Fifth and Allen."

23:02.250 --> 23:04.250
That's five
blocks
from the pool.

23:04.333 --> 23:05.458
And get this

23:05.542 --> 23:06.792
the guy was
agitated, freaked out

23:06.875 --> 23:07.875
and covered in blood.

23:07.959 --> 23:09.125
Unis pick him up?

23:09.208 --> 23:11.000
No, complaint gets
lost in the system.

23:11.083 --> 23:12.959
By the time
it surfaces the next morning

23:13.041 --> 23:14.792
'our homeless man's long gone.'

23:14.875 --> 23:16.458
- Unbelievable.
- 'Gets better.'

23:16.542 --> 23:18.083
Questioned Documents found

23:18.166 --> 23:20.125
what looks like a partial number

23:20.208 --> 23:22.125
in the upper
right hand corner.

23:22.208 --> 23:23.875
Same kind of number
evidence control uses

23:23.959 --> 23:26.166
in our investigations.

23:26.250 --> 23:27.500
You're saying
the letter was
mailed

23:27.583 --> 23:30.542
to Teddy from
inside
Homicide?

23:30.625 --> 23:32.834
Like I said, cover-up.

23:39.750 --> 23:42.500
Vera's canvassing shelters,
soup kitchens in the area

23:42.583 --> 23:44.250
for a six-foot-five male.

23:44.333 --> 23:46.000
Needle in a haystack.

23:46.083 --> 23:48.291
Worth checking with
the cops on homeless shuttle

23:48.375 --> 23:51.917
see if they picked up any
Jolly
Green Giants on their sweeps.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.333
What about the letter?

23:53.417 --> 23:55.333
Well, evidence
custodian back in '94

23:55.417 --> 23:57.333
was a uni name of Jade Diaz.

23:57.417 --> 23:59.667
Only one who
could've signed it out.

23:59.750 --> 24:01.250
Funny thing is,
she transferred

24:01.333 --> 24:04.375
out of evidence control
two weeks before the trial.

24:04.458 --> 24:05.875
You having a talk?

24:05.959 --> 24:07.000
Miller is.

24:07.083 --> 24:09.667
You realize
this is a cop's career?

24:09.750 --> 24:11.333
A cover-up too.

24:11.417 --> 24:12.333
Maybe.

24:12.417 --> 24:13.500
That's a big maybe.

24:13.583 --> 24:15.667
Step lightly.

24:15.750 --> 24:17.875
Always do, boss.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.875
You don't think
she's ready to be
back.

24:27.875 --> 24:30.667
Doer had to write it.

24:30.750 --> 24:34.250
Public never knew
he taped up their eyes.

24:34.333 --> 24:36.500
Seen lots of
evidence over the
years.

24:36.583 --> 24:38.500
I don't recall that letter.

24:38.583 --> 24:41.125
- Sorry.
- Oh.

24:41.208 --> 24:43.208
Well, according to your log

24:43.291 --> 24:47.041
letter came in after
Teddy's confession.

24:47.125 --> 24:48.834
Connelly must've seen it.

24:48.917 --> 24:52.083
'But he had his doers,
so he buries it.'

24:52.166 --> 24:54.542
I'm due at roll call in 20.
Wanna speed this up?

24:54.625 --> 24:57.208
But you know the letter exists

24:57.291 --> 24:58.875
and you got access.

24:58.959 --> 25:02.041
'So you mailed it to Teddy.'

25:02.125 --> 25:03.917
You like being a cop?

25:04.000 --> 25:06.083
'The job?'

25:06.166 --> 25:07.917
- Yeah.
- Me too.

25:11.709 --> 25:14.166
Teddy hung himself.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.750
'Few days ago.'

25:16.834 --> 25:20.250
Oh...I thought you knew.

25:20.333 --> 25:23.417
Just turned 30 years old.

25:23.500 --> 25:27.333
What a waste.

25:27.417 --> 25:29.834
Wonder how he felt..

25:29.917 --> 25:31.750
...when he got that letter?

25:31.834 --> 25:33.500
'Knowing you believed in him.'

25:33.583 --> 25:37.083
Only one in the world who did.

25:37.166 --> 25:38.667
Connelly interviewed the kid.

25:38.750 --> 25:40.208
Twelve hours.

25:40.291 --> 25:43.000
He had me set up
the tape for the
confession.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.583
Tape?

25:46.667 --> 25:49.917
There was never a taped
confession at the trial.

25:51.417 --> 25:53.542
You don't say.

26:03.166 --> 26:06.041
We know about
the tape, Connelly.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.834
One that never made it to court.

26:08.917 --> 26:11.166
Don't you have
open jobs to
work?

26:11.250 --> 26:13.500
Bad guys to catch?

26:13.583 --> 26:16.083
Six-foot-five,
homeless guy, bloody

26:16.166 --> 26:17.959
agitated,
five blocks from the pool.

26:18.041 --> 26:20.125
He bad enough for you?

26:21.583 --> 26:24.291
You saying I'm out of line?

26:24.375 --> 26:27.250
Pot calling
the kettle black,
bro.

26:27.333 --> 26:28.667
Excuse me?

26:28.750 --> 26:32.208
IAD's got it hard for
you
and everyone knows
it.

26:33.917 --> 26:36.959
That was a good shooting, bro.

26:37.041 --> 26:38.834
Someone's gonna take a fall.

26:38.917 --> 26:40.500
From what I hear..

26:40.583 --> 26:42.417
...you're their butt boy.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.041
- Oh, yeah?
- Alright, talk about the
tape.

26:49.583 --> 26:52.500
You got no idea the kind
of pressure we were
under.

26:52.583 --> 26:54.458
Kid killers out there..

26:54.542 --> 26:56.041
...must've been tough.

26:56.125 --> 26:57.834
They did it.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.417
But the little
bastards
won't own up.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.417
So what do you do?
Let them walk?

27:01.500 --> 27:03.041
(Rush)
'Not a chance.'

27:03.125 --> 27:05.667
So you brought in Teddy,
the weak one.

27:05.750 --> 27:08.041
'Crying about how he's innocent'

27:08.125 --> 27:09.458
how he wants his rights.

27:09.542 --> 27:10.834
Where were those
dead kids' rights

27:10.917 --> 27:13.083
when they were
being beaten to death?

27:15.291 --> 27:18.125
They didn't have any rights.

27:26.959 --> 27:29.250
I already told you,
we didn't do nothing.

27:29.333 --> 27:31.917
You saw those kids at
the pool, though, didn't you?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.667
No. Not that day, we didn't.

27:33.750 --> 27:35.750
And you got mad at them
'cause they called you

27:35.834 --> 27:38.375
freaks, weirdoes, didn't they?

27:38.458 --> 27:40.709
No, just you do that.

27:49.333 --> 27:51.667
You hit them over and over

27:51.750 --> 27:55.250
till they stopped moving.

27:55.333 --> 27:56.917
Just say it

27:57.000 --> 27:59.709
and you can go home.

27:59.792 --> 28:02.417
And this nightmare is over.

28:07.166 --> 28:11.250
Don't you wanna go home, Teddy?

28:11.333 --> 28:12.542
Yeah.

28:27.709 --> 28:29.792
Then just say it.

28:31.917 --> 28:34.375
We saw them at the pool.

28:36.291 --> 28:38.083
Then what happened?

28:40.041 --> 28:41.291
We stabbed them.

28:41.375 --> 28:44.125
You hit them,
you mean,
right?

28:44.208 --> 28:46.125
Thrill kill.

28:46.208 --> 28:48.250
Yeah...okay.

28:48.333 --> 28:49.458
We hit them.

28:49.542 --> 28:52.291
Over and over until
they stopped moving.

28:55.917 --> 28:57.917
I want my mom.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.625
'I wanna go home.'

29:05.709 --> 29:09.125
You got no right to judge me.

29:09.208 --> 29:11.750
Those boys did it.

29:11.834 --> 29:14.917
You sure about that...Connelly?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.041
Absolutely.

29:17.125 --> 29:19.250
Then why'd you bury the tape?

29:25.250 --> 29:28.625
My snitch swears he saw Big
Foot
here a couple hours ago.

29:28.709 --> 29:32.166
Yeah, your snitch's a money
grubbing pain in the ass.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.667
Yo!

29:33.750 --> 29:36.959
You seen a six-foot-five
<i>mamacitas?</i>

29:38.417 --> 29:41.000
Or I could just take you
in for loitering.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.333
Been to every shelter,
soup kitchen in the city.

29:43.417 --> 29:45.166
We're not gonna find him.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.792
Well, it's time to
shut down Hooker Mart.

29:52.041 --> 29:54.291
No pay or play

29:54.375 --> 29:56.417
till you give me
sasquatch, ladies.

29:57.500 --> 29:58.625
It's a fool's errand.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.542
They're not gonna talk to you.

30:00.625 --> 30:02.875
Look..

30:02.959 --> 30:05.917
...you fly, I'll buy.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.291
- Get me a couple of cold
ones.
- Alright.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.834
You wanna find someone?

30:11.917 --> 30:14.375
All you had to do
was ask the right
way

30:14.458 --> 30:16.250
'big boy.'

30:19.250 --> 30:20.792
Where'd you get
the dog, big man?

30:20.875 --> 30:23.291
We found it in your cart.

30:23.375 --> 30:25.000
From the devil.

30:25.083 --> 30:28.458
You mean from
the little boy, in the pool.

30:28.542 --> 30:30.625
How'd you know about that?

30:30.709 --> 30:32.834
'Cause he's God, jackass.

30:34.959 --> 30:35.875
That's right.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.250
'I see everything.'

30:37.333 --> 30:39.417
I saw what you did
to those little boys.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.834
- I didn't mean to.
- Prove it.

30:41.917 --> 30:43.583
Tell me what happened.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.834
It was him..

30:47.917 --> 30:50.250
...the devil.

30:50.333 --> 30:53.333
He made me do it.

31:15.583 --> 31:19.625
All the evil in
the world in those eyes.

31:19.709 --> 31:21.458
He ran..

31:21.542 --> 31:23.458
...he dropped it.

31:23.542 --> 31:26.000
I took it..

31:26.083 --> 31:28.417
...to show the world..

31:28.500 --> 31:31.792
...what he did
to those children.

31:31.875 --> 31:34.875
Looks like we got played.

31:34.959 --> 31:37.083
By the devil himself.

31:41.542 --> 31:42.458
Put his cuffs on.

31:42.542 --> 31:44.250
- What?
- Do it.

31:44.333 --> 31:45.792
[groans]
'You're pretty good.'

31:45.875 --> 31:48.417
You had me going there.
This how you get your kicks?

31:48.500 --> 31:49.875
Hey, I didn't lie to you.

31:49.959 --> 31:52.333
You were at the pool,
standing over the bodies.

31:52.417 --> 31:54.875
- We got a witness.
- You wouldn't understand.

31:54.959 --> 31:55.792
You're right.

31:55.875 --> 31:57.125
I got no idea what it's like

31:57.208 --> 31:58.792
to look into
three little kids' eyes

31:58.875 --> 31:59.834
and beat them to death.

31:59.917 --> 32:00.959
Yeah, well, neither do I.

32:01.041 --> 32:02.625
You were standing
over their bodies!

32:02.709 --> 32:05.959
You were holding Jack's
bloody toy in your hand!

32:06.041 --> 32:07.125
You wanna believe I did it?

32:07.208 --> 32:09.166
Then fine!
Okay, I did
it!

32:09.250 --> 32:12.667
- I killed them!
- You're a monster.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.333
You've got no
idea
what that means.

32:14.417 --> 32:15.834
Why'd you tape their eyes shut?

32:15.917 --> 32:18.500
I thought I knew, how
cruel
and ugly the world was.

32:18.583 --> 32:20.333
I was wrong.

32:22.417 --> 32:25.500
They were just kids.

32:25.583 --> 32:29.041
You know?

32:29.125 --> 32:30.625
We all were.

33:19.166 --> 33:22.250
Um..

33:22.333 --> 33:24.291
...sometimes I dream that, um..

33:29.208 --> 33:32.125
...they're still alive.

33:32.208 --> 33:35.709
And we all get to
start over again.

33:38.625 --> 33:42.208
You saw Jack curled up
with that stuffed dog?

33:43.166 --> 33:44.125
Are you sure?

33:45.166 --> 33:47.041
Like he was asleep.

33:49.834 --> 33:52.041
It was keeping him safe.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.875
Stooping pretty low
bringing me in like
this.

34:05.959 --> 34:08.458
Well, found your son's
stuffed dog, Henry.

34:08.542 --> 34:09.500
Little Duke.

34:09.583 --> 34:12.208
It was left with him.

34:12.291 --> 34:15.291
Your son was,
uh, afraid at nights.

34:15.375 --> 34:17.166
And your wife worked
the graveyard shift.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.542
What's your point?

34:21.667 --> 34:24.583
Leaving him home alone with you.

34:24.667 --> 34:26.125
Night he died.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.625
You people are unbelievable.

34:29.709 --> 34:31.959
'Those bruises Jack had'

34:32.041 --> 34:34.750
Dylan didn't give them
to him, did he?

34:36.709 --> 34:39.959
I loved him.

34:40.041 --> 34:42.375
'Ask anyone, ask my wife.'

34:42.458 --> 34:43.625
'She's here.'

34:49.583 --> 34:50.417
Look..

34:50.500 --> 34:51.458
you got the animals

34:51.542 --> 34:52.750
who murdered my child.

34:52.834 --> 34:55.000
Now why don't you just
leave well enough
alone?

34:55.083 --> 34:58.583
- Doesn't work like that.
- Hey, got to step out.

35:21.250 --> 35:23.250
Why are you
doing this to us?

35:30.333 --> 35:33.125
I think you know why, Tanya.

35:33.208 --> 35:34.875
We lost our son.

35:34.959 --> 35:38.375
We're the victims here.
You have no right.

35:38.458 --> 35:40.583
What's it like?

35:40.667 --> 35:44.333
Cooking his meals,
sleeping in the same bed

35:44.417 --> 35:45.959
'making love..'

35:46.041 --> 35:49.375
...with the man
who killed your child?

35:49.458 --> 35:51.250
How dare you?

35:51.333 --> 35:54.959
My husband is
a good man, decent kind.

35:55.041 --> 35:58.375
It's so much easier to
believe
monsters do these things..

35:59.709 --> 36:01.875
...not men.

36:01.959 --> 36:03.542
I don't have to
listen to this garbage.

36:03.625 --> 36:06.875
We found Jack's stuffed animal.

36:06.959 --> 36:09.083
'Little Duke.'

36:09.166 --> 36:11.792
It was in the pool.

36:11.875 --> 36:13.250
He was holding it

36:13.333 --> 36:15.709
'just like he did at night
when he was sleeping.'

36:18.291 --> 36:19.583
I don't understand.

36:19.667 --> 36:23.041
Whoever hurt him, loved him too.

36:26.583 --> 36:28.166
I have to find my husband.

36:28.250 --> 36:30.417
If Jack was alive today..

36:30.500 --> 36:33.291
...he'd be 24.

36:34.667 --> 36:36.125
A man.

36:36.208 --> 36:38.750
Able to protect himself.

36:38.834 --> 36:41.542
But he couldn't back then.

36:41.625 --> 36:42.959
He was just a little boy.

36:43.041 --> 36:44.959
Please, stop this.

36:45.041 --> 36:47.125
But you can protect him, Tanya.

36:47.208 --> 36:48.792
'You can help him now.'

36:51.041 --> 36:52.667
What'd you see, Tanya?

36:52.750 --> 36:55.625
I don't know what I saw.

36:55.709 --> 36:59.667
You tried to
forget,
but you can't.

37:03.750 --> 37:06.458
It was the day
we buried our son..

37:08.875 --> 37:10.792
...that I saw..

37:35.208 --> 37:38.000
(Henry)
'Honey.'

37:38.083 --> 37:39.375
You found that.

37:39.458 --> 37:42.834
'I've been looking
everywhere for this thing.'

37:46.583 --> 37:49.125
You must have dropped it.

37:52.750 --> 37:54.458
I miss him, honey.

37:55.917 --> 37:57.667
I miss him too.

38:18.875 --> 38:21.792
He has flashlights
in every room, you see.

38:21.875 --> 38:23.083
Why?

38:23.166 --> 38:25.917
Henry's always been
terrified of the dark.

38:27.709 --> 38:30.125
He sleeps with the lights on.

38:31.917 --> 38:33.166
(Stillman)
'You wanted to get caught.'

38:33.250 --> 38:35.792
You were screaming
to get caught.

38:35.875 --> 38:36.792
But no one listened.

38:36.875 --> 38:38.417
They already had
Dylan and Teddy

38:38.500 --> 38:39.917
the perfect scapegoats.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.250
But what gets you in the
end is the people you
love.

38:42.333 --> 38:44.625
Like what happened
to you as a boy.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.667
I'm not following.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.917
Who locked you in a..

38:58.000 --> 39:01.250
'...dark room, Henry?'

39:01.333 --> 39:03.583
Your wife isn't
protecting you anymore.

39:03.667 --> 39:06.125
'Enough with the act.'

39:08.750 --> 39:10.250
I want a lawyer.

39:10.333 --> 39:13.083
I'm not talking to you.

39:13.166 --> 39:14.375
Fine.

39:14.458 --> 39:17.291
Maybe you should spend
some time alone then.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.959
In the dark.

39:24.750 --> 39:26.500
'No.'

39:32.500 --> 39:34.709
If you lock me in here,
I'll kill you!

39:34.792 --> 39:37.083
'I will kill you!'

39:37.166 --> 39:39.667
- You hear me?
- Sit down, Henry.

39:41.875 --> 39:43.959
Sit down.

39:52.709 --> 39:54.959
Don't leave me in here.

39:55.041 --> 39:56.917
Please, don't leave me in here.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.250
And you promised yourself

39:58.333 --> 39:59.750
you would never
let it happen again.

39:59.834 --> 40:02.750
No one would ever
put you in the dark.

40:02.834 --> 40:05.083
Or they would pay.

40:05.166 --> 40:07.667
(Stillman)
'And that's why you
taped their eyes shut.'

40:07.750 --> 40:10.041
Make them pay forever.

40:10.125 --> 40:13.667
He was...he was
a bad boy, that Jack.

40:14.667 --> 40:18.041
Sneaking off.

40:18.125 --> 40:20.417
(Henry)
'So many..'

40:20.500 --> 40:22.333
so many dirty bad things

40:22.417 --> 40:25.959
in the dark...waiting for you.

40:26.041 --> 40:28.500
(Stillman)
'You told Jack to play
inside..'

40:28.583 --> 40:31.583
...where it was safe.

40:31.667 --> 40:34.667
Nowhere is safe.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.959
It's darkness everywhere.

40:39.750 --> 40:41.667
Inside the house,
inside the basement.

40:41.750 --> 40:44.542
Inside..

40:44.625 --> 40:47.750
...inside of me.

40:47.834 --> 40:49.291
<i>(Henry)</i>
<i>Jack!</i>

40:49.375 --> 40:52.041
How many times I got to tell
you
to put those damn bikes away?

40:56.709 --> 40:59.542
Don't.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.667
No.

41:01.750 --> 41:05.083
Please, daddy.

41:05.166 --> 41:07.709
Don't leave me here.

41:07.792 --> 41:09.458
No, not the dark!

41:09.542 --> 41:12.625
Please don't!

41:29.959 --> 41:31.583
Daddy?

43:59.458 --> 44:00.625
