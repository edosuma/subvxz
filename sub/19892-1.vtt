03:14.651 --> 03:19.120
<i>Blue smoke goes drifting by</i>

03:19.198 --> 03:24.006
<i>Into the deep blue sky</i>

03:24.075 --> 03:27.356
<i>When I think of home</i>

03:27.427 --> 03:29.248
<i>I sadly sigh</i>

03:29.318 --> 03:30.709
Hello, Tim.

03:32.172 --> 03:36.177
<i>Oh, I can see you there...</i>

03:36.254 --> 03:38.211
I salute the flag...

03:39.273 --> 03:41.354
...in my liberty and justice.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.980
Shut up!

03:43.056 --> 03:45.013
Ah, you old bastard.

03:45.081 --> 03:48.158
<i>Get out of bed, you lazy
bugger-on Braithwaite.</i>

03:48.233 --> 03:49.918
Never done a tap in your life.

03:53.808 --> 03:58.412
<i>...with a longing to stay</i>

03:58.487 --> 04:02.300
<i>I promise to be true</i>

04:02.370 --> 04:06.646
<i>And to love only you</i>

04:06.717 --> 04:11.186
<i>Blue smoke goes drifting by</i>

04:11.262 --> 04:15.766
<i>Into the deep blue skies</i>

04:15.841 --> 04:19.915
<i>My memories of home</i>

04:19.988 --> 04:22.467
<i>Will never die</i>

04:28.518 --> 04:29.672
Come on, boy.

04:31.935 --> 04:33.055
Dad.

04:34.226 --> 04:35.379
I'm going without you, Jasmine.

04:35.453 --> 04:36.539
I don't want to come.

04:36.615 --> 04:37.836
Come on. I'll race you.

04:37.908 --> 04:39.130
I'll beat you.

04:57.652 --> 04:58.738
<i>...times 19.</i>

04:58.814 --> 04:59.900
<i>In Wellington,</i>

04:59.976 --> 05:01.491
<i>rain with strong southerlies at 17.</i>

05:01.569 --> 05:02.790
<i>Christchurch, cloud clearing,</i>

05:02.863 --> 05:04.446
<i>moderate southerlies at 18,</i>

05:04.522 --> 05:06.173
<i>and Dunedin fine with light winds</i>

05:06.247 --> 05:07.796
<i>and a high of 17.</i>

05:07.873 --> 05:11.222
<i>Radio New Zealand News,
it's 8 minutes past 7.</i>

05:13.415 --> 05:15.101
Hmm.

05:15.174 --> 05:16.792
Mm. Mmm.

05:17.961 --> 05:20.813
I'll change your sheets
and put them through.

05:20.881 --> 05:22.001
Did you put your towel out?

05:22.076 --> 05:24.395
I'll do it, Mum.

05:24.465 --> 05:26.581
Did you put your towel out?

05:26.655 --> 05:28.171
Your towel, Jimmy.

05:28.249 --> 05:30.138
Mmm. Hmm?

05:32.562 --> 05:35.108
I wish you wouldn't feed
that dog while you're eating.

05:35.183 --> 05:37.661
You just don't like him.
Does she?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.458
Dogs have to have breakfast, too.

05:39.530 --> 05:41.985
<i>Otherwise, how would they look after
Mum when I'm away?</i>

05:42.052 --> 05:44.100
<i>Oh ho ho ho ho!</i>

07:16.759 --> 07:18.739
Do you mind
if I have a look around?

07:29.070 --> 07:31.151
There's been washing missing.

07:31.226 --> 07:33.013
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.438
<i>Underwear. Off clotheslines.</i>

08:22.130 --> 08:23.420
Come on, sweetheart.

08:23.491 --> 08:24.972
<i>Can I have a bowl of fizzie?</i>

08:25.050 --> 08:26.973
<i>You don't drink fizzie.</i>

08:28.535 --> 08:29.825
Dad lets me.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.399
Hey, Jasmine.
Good morning, Chiquita.

08:35.469 --> 08:36.395
Good morning.

08:36.465 --> 08:37.551
Where's your dad?

08:37.626 --> 08:39.018
He's on his way.

08:43.235 --> 08:45.215
What's the matter?

08:45.292 --> 08:46.978
<i>Mum says fizzie's poison.</i>

08:47.051 --> 08:48.204
Will you take these in?

08:48.279 --> 08:50.168
If it was poison,
I'd be dead already.

08:50.236 --> 08:51.491
Hi there.

08:52.924 --> 08:53.886
Hey.

08:53.953 --> 08:55.243
Grr!

09:03.941 --> 09:06.555
Mmm.

09:08.321 --> 09:09.340
Ecch!

09:09.416 --> 09:10.570
Come on.

09:10.644 --> 09:12.002
<i>Oy. Oy, oy.</i>

09:12.072 --> 09:13.429
Lunches.

09:13.498 --> 09:15.421
Come on, you guys.

09:19.106 --> 09:20.067
Five clients today.

09:20.135 --> 09:22.646
Four bods and my mum.

09:22.723 --> 09:24.804
Going to tell her?

09:24.880 --> 09:28.590
Yeah. Yeah. She'll...

09:28.663 --> 09:29.987
Did you tell Rewa?

09:32.081 --> 09:33.201
Not yet.

09:33.275 --> 09:34.995
How about the girls?

09:41.572 --> 09:43.190
You tell them, Julie-Anne.

09:45.288 --> 09:46.646
Why?

09:55.973 --> 09:57.228
<i>Okay.</i>

09:59.690 --> 10:02.835
And all here together
for dinner, shall we?

10:02.908 --> 10:04.457
Goose dinner.

10:21.192 --> 10:22.979
Jason's birthday present.

10:23.051 --> 10:23.978
<i>Oh.</i>

10:24.046 --> 10:25.936
Got your keys?

10:26.005 --> 10:27.463
Got my keys.

10:27.531 --> 10:28.719
Glasses?

10:30.417 --> 10:31.775
Got your head?

10:31.844 --> 10:33.496
My head? I think.

10:33.570 --> 10:36.081
Well, don't forget to tell
Heather I want to see her...

10:36.158 --> 10:37.448
I won't forget.

10:38.979 --> 10:40.133
<i>Oh.</i>

10:47.241 --> 10:48.463
Tina!

10:48.536 --> 10:49.622
Hurry up, you two!

12:51.846 --> 12:52.773
Good morning, Stu.

12:52.841 --> 12:53.825
Morning, Nick.

12:55.761 --> 12:57.548
Two sugars.

12:57.620 --> 12:58.910
Stirred.

13:01.602 --> 13:02.926
Stirred.

13:06.944 --> 13:08.596
<i>Ohh...</i>

13:08.670 --> 13:11.216
<i>Okay, I'll take care of these.</i>

13:15.340 --> 13:16.856
They're linked?

13:16.932 --> 13:18.889
Not... No, no.
Don't think so.

13:21.512 --> 13:23.095
Dogs.

13:23.171 --> 13:25.060
Father lost another five ewes.

13:25.129 --> 13:26.453
Two dogs.

13:26.522 --> 13:28.004
Very timely.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.802
I'll head up there this afternoon.

13:29.874 --> 13:31.627
Yeah, you probably aren't
going to find them.

13:31.700 --> 13:32.990
Take a rifle up with you.

13:33.060 --> 13:34.418
It will look like we mean action.

13:35.516 --> 13:37.031
There.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.363
Here we go.

13:39.896 --> 13:41.445
Reports.

13:52.970 --> 13:55.946
Barbecue at the crib Sunday
if the weather holds?

13:56.023 --> 13:59.133
Mate, if the weather holds,
I'll be on the bloody roof.

14:00.702 --> 14:02.851
I'll tell Fiona.

14:03.887 --> 14:05.346
I'll bring Jordan out.

14:05.414 --> 14:07.665
I'll give you a hand
with the roof Saturday morning.

14:07.737 --> 14:09.524
All right. You're on.

14:09.595 --> 14:12.242
<i>Oh, hey, Stu,
keys to the gun, please.</i>

15:07.932 --> 15:11.473
Banker's check made out to
Frontier Guns and Ammunition.

15:11.549 --> 15:13.902
That it, Mr. Gray?

15:13.971 --> 15:17.410
There's a banking fee
of $2.00 on that check.

15:20.840 --> 15:21.801
$2.00.

15:21.869 --> 15:23.090
It's the standard fee

15:23.163 --> 15:25.583
for a bank check, Mr. Gray.

15:29.401 --> 15:31.449
You've never charged me before.

15:31.526 --> 15:34.139
No way.

15:34.213 --> 15:35.672
There's no way.

15:37.996 --> 15:40.214
I've banked here all my life.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.332
My father used to bank here.

15:46.258 --> 15:48.374
<i>No wayl</i>

15:50.506 --> 15:52.429
<i>I've banked here all my lifel</i>

15:52.497 --> 15:54.477
<i>My father banked herel</i>

15:54.554 --> 15:56.013
<i>Am I not his son?</i>

15:57.807 --> 15:58.960
<i>Well?</i>

16:00.195 --> 16:01.450
<i>All right?</i>

16:01.523 --> 16:03.876
<i>It's my moneyl</i>

16:06.069 --> 16:07.324
<i>I've got a rightl</i>

16:07.397 --> 16:09.082
<i>It's my moneyl</i>

16:48.545 --> 16:51.792
It's been giving me gyp, Gar.

16:51.862 --> 16:55.076
If I want to see behind me,
I have to turn my whole body.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.075
<i>Ow.</i>

16:56.144 --> 16:57.965
Relax, Mum.

16:58.034 --> 17:00.353
You're tight as a drum.

17:03.012 --> 17:04.992
Pain is just a symptom.

17:05.069 --> 17:06.755
You've got to ask yourself why.

17:06.829 --> 17:07.881
It's a mother chakra.

17:07.955 --> 17:10.434
Smoking buggers her up.
Don't smoke.

17:10.511 --> 17:14.585
Gar, no lecture.
Just the massage.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.480
Quietly.

17:26.241 --> 17:29.318
Julie-Anne and I,
we're going to move in together.

17:30.721 --> 17:33.538
<i>We get on, you know?
Our energies.</i>

17:35.167 --> 17:36.491
What do you think?

17:36.561 --> 17:38.020
What do the kids think?

17:39.415 --> 17:40.998
When?

17:41.074 --> 17:43.494
We'll tell them tonight.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.112
I wanted you to...

17:46.416 --> 17:49.267
Well, I'm happy for you.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.051
<i>I wish you both well.
Of course I do.</i>

17:52.124 --> 17:54.635
The kids will be okay.

17:54.712 --> 17:55.731
They tell me...

17:56.803 --> 17:57.889
<i>Oh, bloody David.</i>

18:02.444 --> 18:05.193
Leave those bloody dogs alone!
So help me I'll...

18:06.492 --> 18:07.476
David!

18:16.348 --> 18:19.324
He gets worse and worse.

18:19.401 --> 18:22.444
Like here goes.
He's got a pile of rocks out there.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.907
He just sits there and...

18:24.975 --> 18:26.796
You and he used to be...

18:26.867 --> 18:28.722
And then he helped you
build this place.

18:28.791 --> 18:30.115
Baby-sat your kids.

18:30.186 --> 18:31.373
Years ago, Ma.

18:31.447 --> 18:32.872
Lately he's...

18:32.939 --> 18:35.225
Guy's eccentric, Gar.

18:35.295 --> 18:36.914
No crime in being eccentric,

18:36.988 --> 18:39.941
or they'd lock up half the Spit.

18:40.007 --> 18:41.626
They'd lock you up.

19:05.725 --> 19:06.708
Help you?

19:08.977 --> 19:10.458
I called you about a Papoose.

19:10.537 --> 19:11.996
Gray. David Gray.

19:12.063 --> 19:14.110
<i>Oh, yeah. I put it away for you, mate.</i>

19:15.779 --> 19:16.933
Best balanced sporting rifle about,

19:17.007 --> 19:18.693
from what I read and what I hear.

19:18.766 --> 19:21.413
Yeah, probably, for the price,

19:21.488 --> 19:23.207
Winchester or Remington

19:23.279 --> 19:24.432
probably best of the range, but...

19:24.507 --> 19:25.989
Tough fellow, too, eh?

19:31.808 --> 19:33.391
Thanks.

19:33.466 --> 19:34.824
See.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.606
Nice.

19:39.705 --> 19:41.685
But not too heavy.

19:42.990 --> 19:44.506
Good in the hand.

19:46.872 --> 19:48.128
Good weight.

19:51.187 --> 19:52.408
Nice action.

19:52.481 --> 19:53.770
All-weather.

19:53.841 --> 19:57.088
Probably best all-weather
at that price.

19:57.160 --> 20:01.074
Nice. Nice.

20:01.142 --> 20:02.827
Take a silencer?

20:02.900 --> 20:05.751
Not much call for a silencer
on a. 22 like this one.

20:05.820 --> 20:06.940
No. You could, right?

20:07.015 --> 20:09.402
We can get a thread
put on it for you.

20:09.471 --> 20:11.451
You want to look at a silencer?

20:13.619 --> 20:15.700
No.

20:15.775 --> 20:17.257
Tell you what.

20:18.828 --> 20:19.755
Put the thread on.

20:19.824 --> 20:21.905
I'll put a deposit on it.

20:21.981 --> 20:23.700
I'll come back and pay the balance.

20:23.773 --> 20:24.791
<i>Okay.</i>

20:24.868 --> 20:26.882
Friday, okay? Next Friday.

20:26.958 --> 20:28.078
100 deposit.

20:28.153 --> 20:30.472
Suits me.

20:30.543 --> 20:32.500
Appreciate your professional approach.

20:32.566 --> 20:33.754
You don't get it everywhere.

20:33.827 --> 20:35.785
A bad day?

20:35.851 --> 20:38.069
Town's full of idiots and incompetents.

20:38.142 --> 20:39.929
I know what you mean, mate.

22:12.184 --> 22:13.541
I'm not a Peeping Tom, Stu.

22:13.610 --> 22:16.924
No? Well, people see you
sneaking around at night.

22:29.207 --> 22:30.926
You got a girlfriend?

23:18.650 --> 23:21.467
David! The mail came for you.

25:20.965 --> 25:22.289
Mum, we're home!

25:22.358 --> 25:23.410
Hi!

25:23.487 --> 25:25.070
Hi. Julie-Anne, it's Friday!

25:25.146 --> 25:28.755
Come on. Mind what's happening
to you, or you won't get any.

25:28.829 --> 25:30.221
<i>Oh.</i>

25:30.289 --> 25:31.748
All homemade.
There was no poison.

25:31.816 --> 25:32.778
- Mm.
- Mm.

25:32.844 --> 25:34.824
I've got something to tell you.

25:34.902 --> 25:36.485
Can we go down to the beach?

25:36.561 --> 25:37.918
Quiet, you kids, all of you.

25:37.988 --> 25:40.069
Shh! Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!

25:40.145 --> 25:42.691
All right, what I want to say...

25:42.767 --> 25:44.950
<i>Oh, look, you get on so well together.</i>

25:45.022 --> 25:47.409
We all do. And, um...

25:47.479 --> 25:48.870
here you all are.

25:48.939 --> 25:51.586
I love you all. I really do.

25:51.659 --> 25:55.574
Garry and I, we love
each other very much,

25:55.642 --> 25:59.024
and we want for us all to be together.

25:59.092 --> 26:00.574
What do you think of that?

26:00.652 --> 26:02.134
Hmm?

26:05.165 --> 26:06.352
Which house?

26:06.426 --> 26:08.316
Which one?

26:08.384 --> 26:09.436
That's not fair.

26:09.512 --> 26:11.095
I want to live at my house

26:11.171 --> 26:13.852
with my mum and my dad.

26:13.926 --> 26:15.509
I don't want to live with Garry.

26:15.584 --> 26:16.942
I want to live with you.

26:17.012 --> 26:18.131
<i>Yeah, it's all right, kikabhai.</i>

26:18.206 --> 26:19.292
I'll always be here.

26:19.368 --> 26:20.951
Your dad will still be your dad.

26:21.026 --> 26:23.108
Garry will just be Garry.

26:24.578 --> 26:26.127
I'm staying with Dad.

26:30.385 --> 26:32.500
It's not fair.

26:32.575 --> 26:33.932
<i>Okay, nobody has to do anything</i>

26:34.002 --> 26:35.189
they don't want to do.

26:37.585 --> 26:38.773
I'm going to the beach.

26:38.846 --> 26:39.966
I'm going where my dad is.

26:40.041 --> 26:41.861
I've got one photo
left in the camera.

26:41.932 --> 26:43.018
<i>Come on, you guys. Outside.</i>

26:43.094 --> 26:46.137
<i>Come on. Outside, you lot.</i>

26:46.213 --> 26:47.299
Chop-chop.

27:07.385 --> 27:09.432
You're going to go down
to the beach with your dad?

27:14.652 --> 27:15.771
Race you!

27:15.846 --> 27:17.464
I'll beat you!

27:21.421 --> 27:25.800
<i>Ya ya ya ya ya</i>

27:25.868 --> 27:27.722
What are you going to do with this?

27:27.792 --> 27:29.150
Going to get the party started.

27:29.219 --> 27:30.146
<i>Oh.</i>

27:30.215 --> 27:31.198
<i>Ya ya</i>

27:31.277 --> 27:32.792
All right.

27:36.354 --> 27:39.103
Turn that bloody thing down,

27:39.174 --> 27:40.260
you selfish bugger!

27:53.111 --> 27:54.038
Hello, Ma.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.090
Hi.

27:55.169 --> 27:57.024
Hey, hey, what have I got for you?

27:57.093 --> 27:58.677
Look at that.

27:58.752 --> 28:02.067
<i>Oh, yum. Oh, yum.
It's good to see you.</i>

28:02.137 --> 28:03.223
I did the washing.

28:03.298 --> 28:04.881
You didn't get around to the lawn.

28:04.958 --> 28:06.644
You're slipping, Mum.

28:06.716 --> 28:08.266
Get out now.

28:08.342 --> 28:11.691
You'll catch the last of the sun.

28:11.760 --> 28:13.548
Slave driver.

28:13.618 --> 28:14.908
Come on, come on, come on.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.653
All right.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.610
Would you like to bless
our food, Chiquita?

28:24.569 --> 28:26.051
Jasmine? Rewa?

28:28.717 --> 28:30.007
<i>Okay.</i>

28:30.077 --> 28:31.864
<i>E te Atua.</i>

28:31.936 --> 28:33.361
<i>Bless this food, O Lord,</i>

28:33.429 --> 28:36.211
<i>and your tamariki
Jasmine, Rewa, Chiquita,</i>

28:36.283 --> 28:37.573
and Garry and me,

28:37.644 --> 28:40.754
so that by eating well
we will live well

28:40.829 --> 28:42.548
and be happy together.

28:42.621 --> 28:45.042
<i>Ake, ake, ake.</i>

28:45.109 --> 28:46.297
Amen.

28:49.191 --> 28:50.174
Dig in.

28:50.253 --> 28:51.508
Yum.

28:53.107 --> 28:55.155
I just wanted to say...

28:57.852 --> 28:59.832
I'm very, very happy.

29:19.621 --> 29:21.103
After you?

29:25.494 --> 29:26.953
Useless.

29:53.899 --> 29:55.324
Patch!

29:56.355 --> 29:58.075
Patch?

29:58.146 --> 29:59.967
Patch! Here, boy!

30:02.294 --> 30:04.444
Garry said he'd fix your bike, Rewa.

30:04.518 --> 30:05.909
Why don't you help him?

30:07.339 --> 30:08.696
Can I be excused, too, Julie-Anne?

30:08.766 --> 30:09.749
Yeah. Away you go.

30:17.128 --> 30:18.553
Have you seen Patch, Mum?

30:18.621 --> 30:21.008
<i>Oh, he'll be down
in the ditch, son.</i>

30:21.077 --> 30:22.932
That's where he goes.

30:24.163 --> 30:25.350
Come on, Patch!

30:26.917 --> 30:29.168
I think I'll go and help Dad, too.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.138
Get off my property!

30:42.214 --> 30:43.572
You think you own the place!

30:43.641 --> 30:45.225
Get out of there,
you trespassing horror!

30:45.300 --> 30:47.314
Don't talk to my kids like that.

30:47.392 --> 30:49.315
Calm down, David. Go on.

30:49.383 --> 30:51.894
Don't you tell me what to do.

30:51.970 --> 30:53.225
Think you're king of Aramoana.

30:53.298 --> 30:54.655
This is my property, and I'll...

30:54.725 --> 30:56.807
Yeah, you got something,
you sort it with me.

30:56.881 --> 30:58.136
Why are they yelling?

30:58.209 --> 30:59.668
Fuck you, Garry!

31:01.329 --> 31:04.836
You stay away from my girls!

31:04.912 --> 31:05.930
Shit.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.523
Inside!

31:27.610 --> 31:29.590
Fireworks?

31:29.667 --> 31:32.620
Too late for fireworks, Vic.

31:32.687 --> 31:34.474
I'll take a look.

32:47.980 --> 32:49.405
What happened?

32:49.474 --> 32:51.261
Did you cut yourself?

32:55.247 --> 32:57.962
Julie-Anne! Julie-Anne!

33:02.282 --> 33:03.707
<i>Oh, little dear.</i>

33:03.776 --> 33:05.066
David shot me!

33:05.136 --> 33:06.426
He shot me!

33:06.497 --> 33:09.077
And he shot Dad!
Dad's lying on the grass!

33:09.151 --> 33:10.203
My God!

33:11.806 --> 33:12.733
<i>Oh, God.</i>

33:12.801 --> 33:15.087
- He's dead, he...
- Wait there.

33:15.157 --> 33:16.740
Bullet to the head.

33:16.817 --> 33:18.141
Sweetheart, hold this to you.

33:18.210 --> 33:20.190
And Rewa and Jasmine,
they were in the house.

33:20.268 --> 33:22.021
<i>Take this. Oh, God.</i>

33:22.093 --> 33:23.020
And David...

33:23.088 --> 33:24.446
Get in there.

33:24.515 --> 33:26.597
I'm going to take you
in the van, darling.

33:26.673 --> 33:28.154
I'm going to put you in.

33:30.886 --> 33:31.813
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

33:31.882 --> 33:33.568
Come on, get in there.

33:33.641 --> 33:34.568
In the van.

33:35.632 --> 33:36.820
It'll be all right.

33:36.892 --> 33:38.816
<i>Oh, God.</i>

33:59.723 --> 34:01.805
Rewa!

34:01.880 --> 34:03.204
- I'm scared, Julie-Anne.
- Rewa!

34:03.274 --> 34:05.525
Julie-Anne, I'm scared.

34:05.597 --> 34:07.780
I'm scared!

34:07.853 --> 34:11.134
I'm coming back, sweetheart!

34:11.205 --> 34:12.630
Get down!

34:12.697 --> 34:14.417
I'm coming back!

34:20.130 --> 34:22.054
Get down! Get down, Chiquita!

34:33.404 --> 34:34.659
Is that a backfire?

34:42.032 --> 34:43.014
Shit.

34:45.848 --> 34:47.737
It's on fire!
Garry's place is on fire!

34:47.806 --> 34:49.389
I'll get Tim!

34:52.551 --> 34:55.027
Tim, wake up!
Holden's place is on fire!

34:55.107 --> 34:57.222
Wake up, Tim!
We're going to need your room!

35:09.806 --> 35:11.356
Never, I tell ya.

35:13.756 --> 35:14.683
Jesus Christ.

35:14.751 --> 35:16.505
What the hell's going on?

35:18.334 --> 35:19.624
Get out! Get out!

35:19.695 --> 35:20.815
David's got a gun!

35:20.890 --> 35:22.848
I think he's gone bloody!
Now get out!

35:22.914 --> 35:24.464
Go! Get out!

35:25.933 --> 35:27.449
<i>Okay, put them...</i>

35:27.527 --> 35:30.106
Jesus Christ.
Leave the goat!

35:30.181 --> 35:31.301
Come on!

35:42.957 --> 35:44.280
The key.

36:42.986 --> 36:44.740
Chiquita's dad is dead.

36:44.811 --> 36:47.991
Hold on. Hold on, love.

36:48.063 --> 36:49.149
You all right?

37:06.447 --> 37:08.924
Look! It's on fire!

37:10.960 --> 37:13.279
Stanley, look!

37:13.349 --> 37:14.932
What in the bloody
hell's going on?

37:15.009 --> 37:16.592
Stanley, whatever can we do?

37:16.667 --> 37:19.281
How about getting
into the bloody fire?

37:20.848 --> 37:22.568
- Kids, stay down!
- Don't move!

37:22.640 --> 37:24.122
Stay down, kids!

37:24.200 --> 37:26.654
No! Stay down!

37:51.800 --> 37:53.384
There's a man with a gun!

37:53.460 --> 37:54.943
Get out of the way!

38:00.763 --> 38:02.088
What's going on?

38:02.158 --> 38:03.742
The man in the car said something...

38:03.818 --> 38:04.745
Said a gun.

38:04.814 --> 38:05.833
A gun.

38:05.909 --> 38:08.196
Hey, that's a fire.

38:08.266 --> 38:10.485
By golly, it is, too.

38:41.133 --> 38:42.354
Gee... Gee...

38:42.428 --> 38:43.355
Run!

38:43.424 --> 38:44.351
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

38:44.420 --> 38:45.710
Run! Run!

38:45.781 --> 38:46.708
I can't!

38:46.777 --> 38:47.761
Aah!

38:50.461 --> 38:51.819
Aah! Aah!

39:17.120 --> 39:18.411
<i>Oh...</i>

39:18.481 --> 39:20.768
<i>Oh, God.</i>

39:26.913 --> 39:28.373
Are you all right?

39:30.333 --> 39:32.189
I... I'll come over there.

39:32.258 --> 39:33.775
Don't. Don't.

39:33.852 --> 39:36.602
I need an ambulance.

39:36.674 --> 39:38.858
I'll get... I'll get Jimmy.

39:47.364 --> 39:49.219
I've just had my hips done.

39:51.480 --> 39:52.939
Well...

39:53.007 --> 39:55.191
hang on.

39:55.265 --> 39:57.517
It might take me a bit.

40:06.088 --> 40:07.740
Ah, shit.

40:25.442 --> 40:26.800
<i>Ohh!</i>

40:35.534 --> 40:37.289
Mum, wait!

40:50.174 --> 40:52.755
You're all right, sweetie.

40:52.831 --> 40:54.789
What happened to her?

40:54.855 --> 40:56.474
Have you seen Rewa or Jasmine?

40:56.549 --> 40:57.839
Have you seen Rewa?

40:57.910 --> 41:00.264
Rewa, Rewa, Rewa!

41:00.334 --> 41:01.986
Rewa!

41:17.431 --> 41:18.947
<i>Oh!</i>

42:12.540 --> 42:13.931
Jimmy.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.653
Jimmy!

42:15.726 --> 42:17.741
Are you here, son?

42:31.430 --> 42:34.350
There's a johnny out here
shooting people.

43:02.835 --> 43:05.019
Nick? Phone.

43:07.948 --> 43:09.068
Thank you.

43:09.142 --> 43:10.501
Yeah.

43:43.735 --> 43:45.455
<i>Gray is the offender.</i>

43:45.528 --> 43:49.002
<i>Yeah. Roger. David Gray, 37 years,</i>

43:49.080 --> 43:51.762
<i>uh, he's certainly eccentric.</i>

43:55.156 --> 43:56.514
Is that you?

43:58.542 --> 44:01.428
The... The man said
the ambulance is on its way.

44:01.497 --> 44:02.979
<i>Oh, good idea.</i>

44:03.057 --> 44:06.441
And the police are on their way, too,

44:06.510 --> 44:08.524
so you'll soon be out of it.

44:10.925 --> 44:12.351
I don't think I know you.

44:12.419 --> 44:13.471
Yes, you do.

44:13.548 --> 44:16.729
I'm Jimmy Dickson's mother.

44:16.801 --> 44:18.692
Jimmy, with the little dog.

44:18.759 --> 44:20.118
<i>Oh, yeah. Patch.</i>

44:20.187 --> 44:21.647
Yeah.

44:23.274 --> 44:26.251
He hasn't come home.

44:26.329 --> 44:29.510
I'm worried about him.

44:29.583 --> 44:31.597
How old is he?

44:31.674 --> 44:33.066
45.

44:33.134 --> 44:37.175
<i>Oh. Well, he'll be lying low.</i>

44:39.044 --> 44:41.262
<i>Oh, have you got a wife?</i>

44:41.335 --> 44:42.489
I should be ringing her.

44:42.563 --> 44:45.811
I'm divorced. Twice.

44:45.883 --> 44:49.527
Ha. Made a bit of a mess of my... ha...

44:50.696 --> 44:52.088
Any children?

44:52.157 --> 44:54.635
Don't see them very much.

44:57.236 --> 44:58.889
Well, they're busy these days.

44:58.963 --> 44:59.981
Yeah.

45:01.784 --> 45:03.606
I see Jimmy all the time.

45:03.677 --> 45:04.604
<i>Oh.</i>

45:04.673 --> 45:06.460
And Heather keeps an eye on me.

45:06.532 --> 45:07.856
Huh?

45:07.926 --> 45:09.816
She's my daughter-in-law, really,

45:09.885 --> 45:10.847
but we're very close.

45:10.914 --> 45:12.996
Right.

45:13.072 --> 45:15.358
How are you going?

45:15.429 --> 45:18.315
Not so good.

45:18.384 --> 45:20.365
Is that a siren?

45:27.746 --> 45:30.893
I'll give that ambulance
another call, shall I?

45:30.966 --> 45:31.894
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

45:31.962 --> 45:36.141
Yeah.

45:40.328 --> 45:42.444
<i>Approaching?</i>

45:42.519 --> 45:44.477
<i>Go ahead.</i>

45:44.544 --> 45:46.163
<i>Approaching Whataroa Bay,</i>

45:46.237 --> 45:49.384
<i>which would mean 3 or 4
minutes away from the scene.</i>

45:49.590 --> 45:51.774
Just approaching
the roadblock now.

46:01.807 --> 46:04.319
<i>History, the man was shot a short time ago.</i>

46:04.397 --> 46:05.822
<i>About a minute ago.</i>

46:09.011 --> 46:11.490
Confirming I've got Constable
Russell Anderson with me.

46:13.393 --> 46:15.249
Save a bit of the fire for me, Sid.

46:15.319 --> 46:17.040
Sorry, mate.
Didn't know you were coming.

46:18.506 --> 46:19.797
What have you got?

46:19.867 --> 46:21.554
38.

46:21.626 --> 46:23.879
<i>Armed Offenders is on its way.</i>

46:37.030 --> 46:38.117
Hey, Nick.

46:38.192 --> 46:39.176
Gents.

46:40.616 --> 46:41.940
Locked the station keys

46:42.010 --> 46:44.591
in the safe, left it wide open.

46:44.666 --> 46:47.281
You guys got any spare radios?
Mine's bust.

46:47.355 --> 46:48.871
Just the car radio.

47:02.793 --> 47:05.147
Darren.
I could've taken you out.

47:05.216 --> 47:06.574
It's David Gray.
I've seen him.

47:06.643 --> 47:07.763
Dirty Bird automatic.

47:07.839 --> 47:08.766
Up here.

47:08.835 --> 47:10.690
Can I shoot him if I see him?

47:10.760 --> 47:12.118
Give your. 22 to Russell, Darren.

47:12.188 --> 47:13.115
It's Dad's.

47:13.184 --> 47:14.734
How many rounds you got?

47:14.811 --> 47:15.897
About 15.

47:15.973 --> 47:17.863
Good man.
You look after the car for me.

47:21.517 --> 47:22.841
Shit. Hold up, Stu.

48:26.485 --> 48:28.205
<i>Officer Guthrie here.</i>

48:30.104 --> 48:31.496
Get full staff at Aramoana.

48:31.564 --> 48:33.817
<i>General fire order.</i>

48:33.889 --> 48:35.744
<i>If you're approached
by this person</i>

48:35.814 --> 48:37.433
<i>with an automatic weapon,</i>

48:37.507 --> 48:39.023
<i>you are to identify him.</i>

48:39.101 --> 48:40.357
<i>Call on him to surrender.</i>

48:40.428 --> 48:43.382
<i>If he doesn't, he has to be shot.</i>

48:43.450 --> 48:46.766
Repeat. He can be shot.

49:41.315 --> 49:42.242
Psst!

49:42.311 --> 49:45.423
Shit. Scared the living
shit out of me.

49:53.763 --> 49:55.019
Jesus.

49:57.116 --> 49:58.667
Where's the offender?

50:00.901 --> 50:02.157
I think he's in there.

50:02.230 --> 50:03.157
You think?

50:03.225 --> 50:05.081
I can hear him banging about.

50:05.151 --> 50:06.373
Where's Stu?

50:06.445 --> 50:08.595
He's around the back.

50:08.670 --> 50:10.820
Should we just peel off?

50:10.894 --> 50:12.376
Bugger off.

50:12.455 --> 50:13.710
You got a radio?

50:13.782 --> 50:15.072
No.

50:20.721 --> 50:22.973
Russ, you go around
the south side.

50:23.045 --> 50:24.369
Hook up with Paul, okay?

50:24.439 --> 50:25.366
<i>Okay.</i>

50:25.435 --> 50:26.555
I'll take this position here.

50:26.630 --> 50:27.557
- Darren.
- Yeah?

50:27.626 --> 50:28.984
Go back to the car radio.

50:29.053 --> 50:30.774
Tell Stu we're in position.

50:30.846 --> 50:33.800
Relay any orders from Stu
back here to me, okay?

50:33.867 --> 50:35.327
Yeah. Good as gold.

50:55.413 --> 50:56.839
<i>Officer Guthrie.</i>

50:56.907 --> 50:58.198
<i>We're receiving, sir.</i>

50:58.268 --> 51:00.124
<i>We do not know
where the offender is,</i>

51:00.194 --> 51:02.977
<i>but we are assuming
he is in his house.</i>

51:05.705 --> 51:07.029
What are you doing?

51:07.099 --> 51:08.457
Want to see what's going on.

51:08.526 --> 51:09.454
Fuck off.

51:09.522 --> 51:12.001
Do you hear me? Fuck off.

51:12.078 --> 51:14.693
If the madman doesn't shoot you,
I fucking will.

51:14.768 --> 51:16.092
Now fuck off.

51:36.015 --> 51:38.493
Jesus Christ.

51:53.245 --> 51:54.535
Nick.

51:58.291 --> 51:59.377
Nick.

52:00.415 --> 52:02.599
Vanessa.

52:05.628 --> 52:07.416
Is that you, Vanessa?

52:07.486 --> 52:10.440
Nick. Nick, help me.

52:10.508 --> 52:12.058
Help me.

52:14.691 --> 52:15.777
Can you move?

52:15.853 --> 52:16.780
I...

52:16.849 --> 52:18.535
Can you move to me?

52:22.060 --> 52:25.739
I... I can't.

52:25.812 --> 52:29.695
I can't... Legs can't move.

52:29.762 --> 52:31.053
Nick.

52:40.817 --> 52:42.073
Nicky,

52:42.146 --> 52:45.224
can you see the kids, Nick?

52:45.300 --> 52:47.382
Can you see Stacey?

52:53.533 --> 52:55.388
I'll be with you soon, Vanessa.

52:55.458 --> 52:57.439
Nick, just find my babies.

52:58.679 --> 53:01.860
Just find the kids, Nick.

53:18.265 --> 53:20.721
Jimmy.

53:20.789 --> 53:22.305
Jimmy?

53:29.918 --> 53:31.106
<i>Police emergency.</i>

53:31.180 --> 53:33.228
I rang you before.

53:33.304 --> 53:35.523
The ambulance hasn't come.

53:35.594 --> 53:37.813
Poor devil's very bad.

53:37.886 --> 53:39.006
<i>He'll be okay.</i>

53:39.081 --> 53:41.039
<i>We want you to secure your house.</i>

53:41.106 --> 53:42.792
He's by himself out there.

53:42.866 --> 53:44.450
<i>I want you to shut the windows.</i>

53:44.525 --> 53:46.381
I should go back.

53:46.450 --> 53:49.099
<i>No. Shut your windows, lock the doors,</i>

53:49.173 --> 53:51.720
<i>and keep out of sight.
Can you do that for me?</i>

53:51.795 --> 53:52.814
Lock the door.

53:52.891 --> 53:55.041
Shut the window.

53:55.115 --> 53:56.598
Keep out of sight.

54:04.211 --> 54:05.761
Poor beggar.

54:42.290 --> 54:43.218
Halt! Police!

54:43.286 --> 54:45.867
Stop and put your firearms down!

54:57.163 --> 54:58.215
I can see him.

54:58.292 --> 54:59.616
The offender is on foot, can confirm.

54:59.686 --> 55:01.406
He's got a backpack.
His face looks blackened.

55:01.479 --> 55:03.698
Walking in a northerly direction.

55:06.724 --> 55:08.082
Shall we to the others?

55:12.832 --> 55:14.654
Shit.

55:14.725 --> 55:16.083
I've lost sight of the offender.

55:16.152 --> 55:17.873
Lost sight of him.

55:17.945 --> 55:19.066
We're heading across the road

55:19.140 --> 55:20.124
towards Harvey's position.

55:24.883 --> 55:25.936
Nick.

55:36.802 --> 55:38.352
You all right, mate?

55:38.429 --> 55:40.976
I need to find my boy
and his friend on bikes.

55:41.051 --> 55:41.979
Have you seen them?

55:42.047 --> 55:42.974
No.

55:43.043 --> 55:43.970
He's got fair hair.

55:44.039 --> 55:45.159
Will you be all right?

55:45.234 --> 55:46.694
We'll be back soon. I'm sorry.

56:22.317 --> 56:23.799
Guthrie, ops.

56:23.877 --> 56:26.231
I have eyeball on the back
of the offender's crib.

56:39.812 --> 56:42.132
Stop, David!
Stop or I'll shoot!

56:42.202 --> 56:44.848
Don't shoot!

56:48.178 --> 56:49.660
Fuck.

57:14.139 --> 57:16.323
<i>Oh, shit, shit, shit.</i>

57:16.397 --> 57:19.181
I just got one shot at him,
and he's gone for cover.

57:21.011 --> 57:23.830
Jesus. Something
exploded in the house,

57:23.900 --> 57:25.858
which is making me very nervous.

59:10.533 --> 59:11.755
<i>Knox, copy?</i>

59:13.221 --> 59:14.840
<i>Copy.</i>

59:14.915 --> 59:18.265
<i>Sergeant Guthrie's been shot dead.</i>

59:18.334 --> 59:21.583
<i>Repeat: Sergeant Guthrie
has been shot dead.</i>

59:21.653 --> 59:25.094
<i>We require dogs
in the area immediately.</i>

59:25.173 --> 59:26.927
<i>We've lost sight of the offender.</i>

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:15.164
The phone's very loud, Heather.

01:00:15.236 --> 01:00:16.628
<i>I've rung the police.</i>

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:18.949
<i>They say there's nothing
to worry about, Gran.</i>

01:00:19.021 --> 01:00:21.804
But the man down by the phone box
is very bad.

01:00:21.876 --> 01:00:23.958
<i>Well, no one can get in or out, Gran,</i>

01:00:24.033 --> 01:00:25.617
<i>not even the ambulance.</i>

01:00:25.694 --> 01:00:28.014
<i>They've sealed the village off
for an hour or so.</i>

01:00:28.084 --> 01:00:30.732
<i>Look, just stay where you are.</i>

01:00:37.147 --> 01:00:38.074
<i>Ohh...</i>

01:00:38.143 --> 01:00:39.467
<i>Are you all right, Gran?</i>

01:00:40.899 --> 01:00:42.189
<i>Gran?</i>

01:00:44.948 --> 01:00:46.668
Yes.

01:00:52.385 --> 01:00:54.807
I want to go
to the toilet, Heather.

01:00:54.875 --> 01:00:56.595
<i>I'm sure it's okay.</i>

01:00:56.668 --> 01:00:58.784
The toilet's outside.

01:00:58.858 --> 01:01:00.941
<i>Oh.</i>

01:01:01.017 --> 01:01:03.472
<i>Use the shower.</i>

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:06.958
I couldn't.
It's... It's unhygienic.

01:01:07.025 --> 01:01:08.644
<i>I'll clean it for you.</i>

01:01:08.718 --> 01:01:11.140
<i>I'll scrub it, Gran, if you like.</i>

01:01:11.208 --> 01:01:13.392
Next time I'll ring you.

01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:14.857
It's quieter.

01:01:14.927 --> 01:01:16.580
<i>Okay, love.</i>

01:01:16.653 --> 01:01:18.770
<i>Uh, 20 minutes, see.</i>

01:01:18.844 --> 01:01:19.771
Right.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.527
<i>- On the dot.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

01:01:41.021 --> 01:01:43.002
<i>What is the situation there?</i>

01:01:43.078 --> 01:01:45.161
<i>Is there any member
of the public there</i>

01:01:45.236 --> 01:01:47.624
<i>we can safely evacuate?</i>

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.519
<i>You reckon he's in there?</i>

01:02:10.766 --> 01:02:12.248
We could clear it.

01:02:30.784 --> 01:02:34.757
Nick, we don't have
the training for this.

01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:24.338
I could have shot him.

01:05:28.063 --> 01:05:30.610
He was square in my sights.

01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:35.025
I waited...

01:05:35.102 --> 01:05:36.957
hesitated.

01:05:40.347 --> 01:05:42.305
Fucking gone.

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:52.421
Come on.
Let's get rid of these guns.

01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:52.016
Shh.

01:07:37.238 --> 01:07:38.494
Ness.

01:07:38.566 --> 01:07:39.550
Vivian?

01:07:39.628 --> 01:07:41.178
You hold on, girl. Hold on.

01:07:41.255 --> 01:07:42.182
Stop.

01:07:42.251 --> 01:07:43.235
I'll be back.

01:08:08.445 --> 01:08:10.731
Please don't shoot me. Please.

01:08:10.802 --> 01:08:12.692
Please don't.

01:08:18.902 --> 01:08:21.051
I'm not going
to shoot you, sweetie.

01:08:24.679 --> 01:08:25.662
Stacey?

01:08:30.221 --> 01:08:33.901
I'm Paul. We're policemen.
We're here to help.

01:08:33.974 --> 01:08:35.162
<i>Okay?</i>

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:36.662
Stacey, you know me.

01:08:38.189 --> 01:08:40.805
I'm Jordan's dad, Nick.
You remember?

01:08:41.843 --> 01:08:43.529
Yeah.

01:08:43.602 --> 01:08:46.816
Do you know
Leo and Dion, too?

01:08:46.888 --> 01:08:49.310
They're asleep.

01:09:05.745 --> 01:09:07.261
<i>Okay, look, sweetie,</i>

01:09:07.337 --> 01:09:09.692
everything's going to be
all right, okay?

01:09:09.761 --> 01:09:12.977
Sweetheart, okay?
We're here to help.

01:09:14.642 --> 01:09:17.562
I'm just going to be down here.
I'll be right back.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.933
We got to get them out of here.

01:09:24.004 --> 01:09:25.158
Use your ute.

01:09:25.232 --> 01:09:27.484
I may have lost my keys.

01:09:27.557 --> 01:09:28.982
Fuck.

01:09:30.444 --> 01:09:32.265
<i>One of us has to go for help.</i>

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.044
You go.

01:09:40.769 --> 01:09:44.187
If you see him, you shoot him.

01:09:44.255 --> 01:09:46.337
Don't hesitate.

01:09:55.178 --> 01:09:57.826
Ness, I got Stacey.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:59.258
Huh?

01:09:59.327 --> 01:10:00.719
You hang on, girl.

01:10:00.788 --> 01:10:02.010
You hang on. Stay awake.

01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:04.437
We're going to get you
out of here, okay?

01:10:04.506 --> 01:10:06.464
<i>Okay? Hang on.</i>

01:10:09.718 --> 01:10:11.642
Whereabouts do you live, Stacey?

01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:13.758
Mercury's Bay.

01:10:13.835 --> 01:10:17.151
My tummy hurts.

01:10:18.515 --> 01:10:20.269
Do you want me to lift you down?

01:10:20.342 --> 01:10:24.519
I want to stay with Dion and Leo.

01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:27.171
<i>Okay.
Are you cold, sweetie?</i>

01:10:48.858 --> 01:10:49.911
It's okay.

01:10:53.075 --> 01:10:55.622
It's okay. It's okay.

01:10:55.698 --> 01:10:57.553
We're safe here.

01:11:42.341 --> 01:11:43.632
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:11:50.542 --> 01:11:52.692
Knox, it's Harvey.

01:11:52.765 --> 01:11:54.191
It's cleared.

01:12:01.264 --> 01:12:02.747
<i>Okay. you're on.</i>

01:12:02.824 --> 01:12:04.680
We're going to get you out of here.

01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:06.901
<i>Okay, it's time to go.</i>

01:12:08.635 --> 01:12:10.117
Ness.

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.491
Here you go.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.609
Yeah. They all right?

01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:56.936
It's okay.

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:38.495
Hey, Stace.

01:13:40.062 --> 01:13:41.646
Do you remember

01:13:41.723 --> 01:13:43.941
when I came to your kindie?

01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:49.148
And you and Jordan were
playing on the jungle gym.

01:13:49.226 --> 01:13:51.840
Do you remember that? Yeah?

01:13:51.914 --> 01:13:54.959
And you had
the big wooden truck,

01:13:55.035 --> 01:13:56.722
and Jordan was in the back,

01:13:56.794 --> 01:13:58.616
and I pushed you guys.

01:13:58.687 --> 01:14:00.146
Yeah.

01:14:00.214 --> 01:14:04.062
And then your teacher, Mrs., uh...

01:14:04.131 --> 01:14:06.780
What's her name?

01:14:06.853 --> 01:14:08.472
What was the teacher's name?

01:14:08.547 --> 01:14:09.768
Mrs. Ivey.

01:14:09.841 --> 01:14:11.629
Ah, Mrs. Ivey.

01:14:11.701 --> 01:14:13.591
She read us that story.

01:14:13.659 --> 01:14:15.911
<i>Hairy McClary.</i>

01:14:15.983 --> 01:14:20.223
From Donaldson's Dairy.

01:14:20.299 --> 01:14:22.415
Hercules Morse,

01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:25.568
as big as a horse.

01:14:25.644 --> 01:14:28.360
<i>Bitzer Maloney.</i>

01:14:28.433 --> 01:14:30.288
All?

01:14:30.358 --> 01:14:32.045
Skinny and bony?

01:14:32.117 --> 01:14:33.044
Yeah.

01:14:33.113 --> 01:14:35.625
And Muffin McLay...

01:14:35.703 --> 01:14:36.665
like...

01:14:36.732 --> 01:14:38.882
A bundle of hay.

01:14:38.956 --> 01:14:41.537
And Scarface Claws.

01:14:41.612 --> 01:14:45.031
The toughest tom in town.

01:14:45.098 --> 01:14:46.615
That's it, that's it.

01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:50.767
And he raced them,
and he chased them

01:14:50.841 --> 01:14:54.622
all the way home.

01:14:54.693 --> 01:14:56.583
Stace, hey, look at me.

01:14:56.651 --> 01:14:59.106
That's it, that's it.
You can stay awake.

01:14:59.174 --> 01:15:02.185
And he raced them,
and he chased them

01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:06.733
all the way home.

01:15:06.809 --> 01:15:08.597
Yeah. Good.

01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:10.751
That's a girl.

01:16:42.919 --> 01:16:46.368
Patch?

01:16:49.658 --> 01:16:52.974
Hang on. Hang on, Patch. Hang on.

01:16:55.568 --> 01:16:57.288
<i>Oh, you little horror.</i>

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:08.477
<i>Ohh...</i>

01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:14.782
Where does it hurt, Patch?

01:17:14.856 --> 01:17:16.644
Where does it hurt?

01:20:07.088 --> 01:20:08.672
<i>...Wales and the New Zealand
Governor General...</i>

01:20:38.328 --> 01:20:40.286
<i>...doesn't sound too rosy.</i>

01:20:42.013 --> 01:20:43.767
<i>...because David loved...</i>

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.888
<i>She did talk
to her son himself.</i>

01:20:45.963 --> 01:20:48.385
<i>She sort of feels
that maybe one or two...</i>

01:20:58.845 --> 01:21:01.267
<i>...his family is staying</i>

01:21:01.334 --> 01:21:03.655
<i>with his sister's
family in Johannesburg.</i>

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:05.378
<i>But he says having
everyone together</i>

01:21:05.451 --> 01:21:07.307
<i>has been a great boost
for his mother.</i>

01:21:07.377 --> 01:21:09.301
<i>He says she's been
completely overwhelmed...</i>

01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:45.574
I heard a policeman
had been shot.

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:50.784
I thought it was you.

01:23:00.948 --> 01:23:03.132
It was Stu.

01:23:04.765 --> 01:23:06.452
It was Stu.

01:23:28.037 --> 01:23:30.924
Those kids...

01:23:30.992 --> 01:23:33.245
and Vanessa.

01:23:48.952 --> 01:23:50.378
There.

01:23:50.447 --> 01:23:52.031
<i>Oh...</i>

01:23:59.875 --> 01:24:01.425
<i>Oh, Nick.</i>

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:23.100
<i>Shots firedl He fired shots at usl</i>

01:26:41.186 --> 01:26:43.144
People in Aramoana,
near Dunedin,

01:26:43.210 --> 01:26:44.794
are waking this morning to a tragedy

01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:47.190
which hit the tiny township last night,

01:26:47.261 --> 01:26:49.445
leaving at least two dead,
several missing...

01:26:49.518 --> 01:26:50.571
...feared dead.

01:26:50.647 --> 01:26:51.574
...might meet again

01:26:51.643 --> 01:26:53.431
outside David Gray's house.

01:26:53.502 --> 01:26:55.427
<i>...have told New Zealand News</i>

01:26:55.494 --> 01:26:57.713
as many as eight people
have been slaughtered

01:26:57.785 --> 01:26:59.040
in the Utakura Harbor town.

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:00.233
<i>Others have been told</i>

01:27:00.308 --> 01:27:02.232
to pull their blinds
and stay inside.

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.847
If they venture outside,
there is a possibility...

01:27:04.922 --> 01:27:07.005
<i>They may have
to shoot the crazed gunman</i>

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:08.664
on the loose in
Aramoana near Dunedin.

01:27:11.130 --> 01:27:13.642
<i>Just a revised death toll
from the police</i>

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.146
<i>on the Aramoana shooting.</i>

01:27:15.214 --> 01:27:18.293
<i>There are now 11 people
dead from the shooting.</i>

01:27:18.367 --> 01:27:21.186
<i>Uh, they include three children...</i>

01:27:21.256 --> 01:27:22.738
<i>two boys and a girl...</i>

01:27:22.816 --> 01:27:24.241
<i>a number of women...</i>

01:28:25.262 --> 01:28:26.484
<i>Gran?</i>

01:28:26.556 --> 01:28:28.209
I... I went to sleep, Heather.

01:28:28.284 --> 01:28:29.868
<i>I was worried.</i>

01:28:29.943 --> 01:28:32.659
<i>It's been on for an hour.</i>

01:28:32.732 --> 01:28:36.547
What about Jimmy, yeah?

01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:41.854
I think of him lying
out there somewhere.

01:28:41.927 --> 01:28:43.614
<i>You mustn't, Gran.</i>

01:28:45.646 --> 01:28:49.189
Cold and hurt.

01:28:49.264 --> 01:28:52.547
<i>We're all here together, Gran,</i>

01:28:52.617 --> 01:28:54.801
<i>waiting for you.</i>

01:28:54.875 --> 01:28:56.957
<i>Phillip has come over</i>

01:28:57.033 --> 01:29:02.172
<i>and Honey and Jason.</i>

01:29:02.245 --> 01:29:04.667
<i>You're doing so well, darling.</i>

01:29:04.735 --> 01:29:06.625
<i>We're so proud of you.</i>

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:56.932
Down there, down there.

01:32:45.172 --> 01:32:48.024
Drop your weapons
or be fired upon.

01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:52.946
<i>Oh, good. Good.</i>

01:40:29.185 --> 01:40:32.366
<i>There's a tear</i>

01:40:32.438 --> 01:40:35.653
<i>In my eye</i>

01:40:35.724 --> 01:40:41.362
<i>And an ocean of swallowed pride</i>

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:43.755
<i>There's a heart here</i>

01:40:43.824 --> 01:40:47.934
<i>That beats like a drum</i>

01:40:48.008 --> 01:40:53.849
<i>As I sing the waters by</i>

01:40:53.917 --> 01:40:57.098
<i>Ties that comfort</i>

01:40:57.171 --> 01:41:00.419
<i>Ties that bind</i>

01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:06.296
<i>There's a temple in my mind</i>

01:41:06.366 --> 01:41:09.286
<i>With an altar</i>

01:41:09.354 --> 01:41:12.794
<i>Set for you</i>

01:41:12.873 --> 01:41:17.548
<i>So you know my word is true</i>

01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:25.312
<i>And I will not let you down</i>

01:41:27.215 --> 01:41:32.626
<i>I will not let you down</i>

01:41:32.693 --> 01:41:35.476
<i>That's for sure</i>

01:41:36.710 --> 01:41:40.819
<i>I will not let you down</i>

01:41:42.719 --> 01:41:47.959
<i>I will not let you down</i>

01:41:48.031 --> 01:41:50.578
<i>That's for sure</i>

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:56.653
<i>I will not let you down</i>

01:41:58.189 --> 01:42:03.724
<i>I will not let you down</i>

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:06.720
<i>Anymore</i>
