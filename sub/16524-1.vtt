00:36.200 --> 00:38.793
The late fourth century A.D. the
Roman Empire began to crumble.

00:38.930 --> 00:41.523
Alexandria, in the province of Egypt,
still retained some of its luster,...

00:41.659 --> 00:44.253
...possessed one of the Seven
Wonders of the ancient world:...

00:44.389 --> 00:47.801
...the legendary lighthouse,
and the biggest library known.

00:47.938 --> 00:51.213
The library was a not only
cultural but a religious symbol,...

00:51.350 --> 00:54.079
a place where the pagans worshiped
their ancestral gods.

00:55.581 --> 00:58.856
The traditional pagan worship
in the city now coexisted...

00:58.993 --> 01:02.269
...with the Jews, and an unstoppable
religion up to now banned,...

01:02.405 --> 01:04.221
...Christianity.

01:24.393 --> 01:27.101
How many fools do you think
have asked themselves?

01:27.518 --> 01:30.018
why don't the stars fall
from the sky

01:30.331 --> 01:33.247
But you,
who've had the teachings of the wise,

01:33.768 --> 01:36.998
You know that the stars
move neither up nor down.

01:37.102 --> 01:39.706
they merely revolve
from east to west,

01:39.914 --> 01:43.352
following the most perfect
course ever conceived,

01:43.977 --> 01:45.123
The circle.

01:52.102 --> 01:54.186
Because the circle reigns
in the heavens,

01:54.290 --> 01:57.519
the stars have never fallen
and they never will.

01:57.832 --> 02:01.582
But, what about here on Earth?

02:06.478 --> 02:07.728
Here, bodies do fall.

02:08.561 --> 02:12.103
But their movements
are not circular but linear.

02:12.624 --> 02:13.822
Watch again.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.447
No, leave it.

02:20.436 --> 02:21.895
So,

02:22.103 --> 02:25.489
What mysterious wonder
do you all think might be

02:25.749 --> 02:30.385
lurking beneath the Earth that would
make every single person and animal

02:30.645 --> 02:33.510
and object and slaves circular?

02:35.020 --> 02:36.739
What might it be?

02:37.520 --> 02:39.135
The heaviness, lady.

02:39.395 --> 02:40.333
No.

02:43.770 --> 02:45.073
Synesius.

02:49.604 --> 02:50.385
The weightiness.

02:50.437 --> 02:55.385
No, you're both speaking about the same thing,
but you're not talking about the primary course.

02:58.042 --> 03:01.219
Have any of you ever wondered that your..

03:01.792 --> 03:03.458
that your feet...

03:03.667 --> 03:04.813
your feet

03:05.021 --> 03:08.407
are standing on the very center of the cosmos

03:08.875 --> 03:13.719
that holds all things together
and pulls them together

03:15.646 --> 03:17.469
If there were no center,
then the universe would be

03:18.251 --> 03:20.594
shapeless, infinite, formless,

03:20.855 --> 03:22.261
chaotic.

03:22.522 --> 03:25.022
Will it make a little difference if
we were here or there or anywhere?

03:25.334 --> 03:27.626
And we'd all be better off
never have been born.

03:27.834 --> 03:34.084
Library of Alexandria 391 AD

03:47.106 --> 03:48.824
God, Our Father,

03:49.085 --> 03:50.804
Lord of the universe,

03:51.064 --> 03:53.200
origin of all things,

03:53.460 --> 03:55.231
eternal force of the cosmos,

03:55.335 --> 03:59.346
where everything has
its beginning and everything its end.

03:59.919 --> 04:03.200
Almighty Serapis,
Isis, Horus,

04:03.460 --> 04:07.992
Anubis and all the other gods
we ask for your protection.

04:08.252 --> 04:10.648
both in heaven
and on earth...

04:14.398 --> 04:16.690
I don't know what's happening in the market.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.827
I know you also feel something.
I've seen.

05:06.275 --> 05:08.202
Tell the master we're leaving.

05:22.942 --> 05:27.161
Can you believe? He was courting me
as if I'm one of his conquests.

05:27.838 --> 05:31.119
This Orestes is as foolish
as his father.

05:31.796 --> 05:35.078
I already suggested that he devote
his heart to another muse

05:35.338 --> 05:38.099
one more beautiful than I.

05:38.776 --> 05:40.755
- Who?
- Music.

05:41.276 --> 05:42.838
Music?

05:47.526 --> 05:49.401
He didn't find his music.

06:00.026 --> 06:03.464
What happen?
227 ever become 16.

06:04.818 --> 06:06.485
Look at this, it's 14.

06:53.778 --> 06:59.611
They behave like humans!
They eat, drink and fornicate!

07:02.945 --> 07:07.008
If my gods eat, drink
and fornicate, good for them.

07:07.737 --> 07:10.653
Know this,

07:10.862 --> 07:13.987
you who console yourself
with pagan images.

07:14.195 --> 07:17.008
Men, women,
birds, reptiles!

07:17.633 --> 07:18.883
Serapis!

07:18.987 --> 07:23.779
Serapis! Who could trust
the God, need a flower pot

07:23.987 --> 07:25.758
for a crown?

07:26.279 --> 07:29.196
Hey you, Christians, how arrogant
you'd become now that the

07:29.404 --> 07:31.800
Empire allows you to exist.

07:32.008 --> 07:34.821
My father's father saw them

07:35.029 --> 07:37.008
slaughtered in the circus

07:37.217 --> 07:38.779
and fed to the lions.

07:41.488 --> 07:43.571
Enough! Watch.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.550
Watch.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.467
I shall now walk across the fire.

07:51.592 --> 07:53.155
If my God...

07:55.863 --> 07:59.509
If my God is the true god,
I shall suffer no harm.

07:59.717 --> 08:01.384
If however, your gods exist

08:02.218 --> 08:04.301
they will roast me like a pig.

08:05.343 --> 08:06.488
You...

08:08.259 --> 08:09.822
You're a lie!

08:12.322 --> 08:13.885
You'll get what you deserve.

08:34.717 --> 08:38.052
Now, let's see if you can
walk cross the fire.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.010
What are you doing?

08:42.635 --> 08:44.927
Stop, you can't do that!
Let the man go.

08:45.656 --> 08:47.531
Be quiet pagan or we'd
call you in as well.

09:02.844 --> 09:05.032
Whose is this?

09:06.074 --> 09:07.324
Whose is this?

09:10.136 --> 09:12.115
How many times must
I repeat myself?

09:14.095 --> 09:15.345
Today,

09:16.282 --> 09:19.095
the Christians burned a man.

09:19.616 --> 09:22.220
Right in the middle of the Agora!

09:22.741 --> 09:24.720
I will not have this in my house!

09:24.756 --> 09:26.283
Not in the house of Theon!

09:32.116 --> 09:34.199
Give it to me.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.429
Give it to me!

09:40.658 --> 09:42.637
Master, I beg mercy
for your slave girl.

09:42.950 --> 09:43.991
- Davus!
Get up.

09:44.825 --> 09:46.075
You have nothing to do
with this.

09:46.179 --> 09:47.742
I too, am a Christian.

09:51.075 --> 09:52.429
What did you say?

09:52.638 --> 09:55.346
I too, am a Christian.
Punish me for the both of us.

09:56.908 --> 10:00.346
So, now they presume
to teach us mercy.

10:02.325 --> 10:04.409
Get a whip.
- Father!

10:07.221 --> 10:09.201
Please wait until
you calm before you...

10:11.909 --> 10:13.992
Father, I beg of you.
I beg of you

10:20.763 --> 10:23.888
wrapped in a blazing brightness.

10:23.925 --> 10:25.764
It was the flames, stupid.

10:25.868 --> 10:29.201
Then why didn't he burn
like the pagan? Tell me.

10:35.347 --> 10:36.493
Leave us...

10:45.972 --> 10:47.118
Come here.

10:50.973 --> 10:52.327
Kneel.

11:15.453 --> 11:17.432
Tell me, is it true that
you're a Christian?

11:18.161 --> 11:20.557
I don't know what to say, Mistress.
- Why not?

11:21.286 --> 11:23.890
If I said yes, that would be a lie.

11:25.349 --> 11:28.890
If I said no, that'd mean I lied to
my master. I don't know which one's worst.

11:29.411 --> 11:31.182
Then you should say nothing at all.

11:36.807 --> 11:37.953
There.

11:40.766 --> 11:41.912
Thank you.

11:44.724 --> 11:48.266
I want you to know that the Master
is upset with himself about this.

11:54.829 --> 11:56.183
What is that?

11:58.475 --> 12:00.141
Something I made, Mistress.

12:00.975 --> 12:02.433
But it looks like a...

12:05.037 --> 12:06.183
What is it?

12:07.746 --> 12:09.412
It's Ptolemaic System.

12:10.038 --> 12:11.183
It is.

12:13.475 --> 12:15.038
Did you do this?

12:16.704 --> 12:17.954
Earth

12:19.621 --> 12:21.392
is the center of the cosmos

12:23.163 --> 12:24.934
and revolving around it

12:25.559 --> 12:26.705
the Sun

12:26.913 --> 12:30.455
and the five wanderers: Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

12:30.767 --> 12:33.267
Obstinately disobeying
the law of the circle.

12:33.788 --> 12:37.226
Nevertheless, Ptolemy shows
us that they do obey.

12:37.434 --> 12:38.684
The fact that we see them move

12:38.893 --> 12:40.143
in a loop

12:40.768 --> 12:43.580
is due to the joint
effect of two circles.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.106
One that...

12:45.143 --> 12:47.643
travels around the Earth

12:49.414 --> 12:51.289
and another lesser circle

12:52.122 --> 12:53.685
prophet to each wanderer.

12:53.997 --> 12:57.331
Look, the epicycles.
- See, it's not heaven or earth.

12:58.268 --> 13:00.247
But our eyes
that deceive us.

13:00.977 --> 13:02.294
Well said, Davus.

13:02.331 --> 13:04.414
I'd like you to know that
your exposition shows me

13:04.415 --> 13:06.810
that you've been paying
closer attention than...

13:08.685 --> 13:11.498
One or two.. others here.

13:15.039 --> 13:17.019
I tell you, the gods
should have consulted me

13:17.332 --> 13:18.581
before they created anything.

13:19.935 --> 13:21.498
Why do you say that, Orestes?

13:22.019 --> 13:24.102
It all seem so whimsical!

13:24.936 --> 13:26.811
Why the joint effect
of two circles?

13:27.227 --> 13:32.436
Wouldn't it be more perfect,
if the wanderers didn't wander...

13:32.472 --> 13:35.629
and a single circle
gave sense to everything?

13:35.665 --> 13:38.582
Orestes, by what authority
do you judge the work of God?

13:41.082 --> 13:43.061
What is wrong with you, Christians?

13:44.311 --> 13:46.462
Can a man no longer open
his mouth in this city?

13:46.499 --> 13:50.145
If you criticize creation, you criticize
our Lord and you offend us.

13:50.181 --> 13:51.775
You should move out to the desert.

13:51.811 --> 13:54.103
You won't hear anything
to offend you out there.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.541
You know nothing of what you speak.
None of you.

14:02.437 --> 14:04.728
Synesius, what is Euclid's first rule?

14:06.395 --> 14:07.541
Why the question?

14:07.854 --> 14:09.416
Just.. answer me.

14:13.479 --> 14:14.625
If...

14:15.250 --> 14:18.479
if two things are equal
to a third thing...

14:18.583 --> 14:20.666
then they are all equal to each other.

14:20.771 --> 14:21.708
Good.

14:22.854 --> 14:25.042
Now, are you both not similar to me?

14:29.521 --> 14:30.354
Yes.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.125
And you, Orestes?

14:33.271 --> 14:34.521
Yes.

14:36.084 --> 14:39.938
Now, I'm actually saying this to
everybody here in this room.

14:40.042 --> 14:41.500
More things unite us...

14:41.709 --> 14:43.375
than divide us.

14:43.480 --> 14:47.230
Now, whatever maybe going
on in the streets. We are brothers.

14:47.646 --> 14:49.209
We are brothers.

14:50.147 --> 14:53.376
I want you to remember that brawls
are for slaves and periphera.

14:56.084 --> 15:00.251
Now I think we should all honor Davus
with some very well earned applause.

15:06.918 --> 15:09.730
He'll judge us all
alive and dead.

15:10.147 --> 15:12.335
And then it will be too late,

15:12.439 --> 15:16.189
because only those who believed in Jesus

15:16.501 --> 15:18.481
will be saved.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.772
What are you waiting for?

15:20.981 --> 15:22.856
What are you waiting for?

15:23.793 --> 15:26.189
The Kingdom of God is upon us.

15:27.023 --> 15:29.314
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

15:29.419 --> 15:30.564
Yes.

15:30.877 --> 15:33.794
Yeah but do you
understand like men do?

15:34.002 --> 15:36.398
Do you, not your head, a sheep?

15:40.981 --> 15:42.127
What are you looking at?

15:43.377 --> 15:44.419
Yes, you.

15:44.627 --> 15:46.294
What are you looking here?

15:47.544 --> 15:48.273
Are you Ammonius?

15:49.419 --> 15:51.607
The man who performed the miracle?

15:51.711 --> 15:53.898
Do you want to see a miracle?

15:54.523 --> 15:55.669
Are you the one?

15:56.086 --> 15:57.232
I am.

15:58.586 --> 16:00.149
Come with me.

16:03.586 --> 16:06.399
Jesus went throughout Galilee

16:07.024 --> 16:09.211
teaching in their synagogues.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.024
Preaching the good news
for you

16:12.128 --> 16:16.087
and healing the diseases of sick.

16:17.232 --> 16:20.045
News about him spread
going to Syria

16:21.191 --> 16:23.899
and people came from
all over the world.

16:24.004 --> 16:25.774
That is Theophilus.

16:27.233 --> 16:28.483
Bishop.

16:30.670 --> 16:33.275
For theirs is the Kingdom
of Heaven.

16:33.379 --> 16:35.775
Blessed are those who mourn

16:36.296 --> 16:38.483
for they will be comforted.

16:40.254 --> 16:42.650
Blessed are the meek

16:43.796 --> 16:46.400
for they will inherit the earth.

16:47.546 --> 16:51.088
Blessed are they which do hunger
and thirst for righteousness

16:52.025 --> 16:54.109
for they will be filled.

16:54.213 --> 16:55.359
The word of God!

16:55.567 --> 16:57.442
Blessed are
the merciful

16:57.859 --> 16:59.630
for they will be shown mercy.

17:00.359 --> 17:03.380
Blessed are
the pure in heart,

17:03.692 --> 17:05.358
for they will see God.

17:08.588 --> 17:10.358
The Lord be with you.

17:11.817 --> 17:13.797
So how are you able
to escape the flames?

17:14.005 --> 17:16.608
The Lord be with you.
- And with you.

17:16.922 --> 17:19.422
What do you think I did?
I prayed.

17:20.151 --> 17:23.693
You probable do not even know how.

17:26.714 --> 17:27.964
What do you have in that sack?

17:28.068 --> 17:31.506
Do you have any food here?
- It's for my Master.

17:31.610 --> 17:33.276
What's wrong with you?

17:33.381 --> 17:36.402
I have to pay for that
with my own money!

17:36.714 --> 17:39.214
What do you need money for?

17:39.631 --> 17:41.610
Look at their faces.

17:45.985 --> 17:47.131
Here.

17:47.339 --> 17:49.527
I want you to try it yourself.

17:49.631 --> 17:53.173
And afterwards I will
teach you how to pray.

17:53.381 --> 17:54.527
Go on.

17:58.173 --> 18:00.881
The Lord be with you.
- Bless you.

18:02.027 --> 18:02.861
See?

18:03.069 --> 18:04.840
That is a miracle!

18:04.944 --> 18:07.757
Go on, keep doing it.

18:13.694 --> 18:15.049
The Lord be with you.

18:15.674 --> 18:16.819
Please.

18:18.382 --> 18:20.153
Thank you.

18:25.986 --> 18:27.966
Bless you,

18:28.002 --> 18:29.945
God bless you.

18:30.882 --> 18:33.174
Bless you.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.050
Hey, slave!

18:50.570 --> 18:51.820
What is your name?

18:57.446 --> 18:58.487
Davus.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.196
Davus the slave!

19:01.612 --> 19:04.217
Now, you look like
a true parabolani.

19:04.842 --> 19:07.238
A true soldier of Christ.

19:16.509 --> 19:18.280
What are they saying now?

19:19.217 --> 19:20.780
Telling them to dance.

19:21.196 --> 19:23.696
The men are now heavy with wine.

19:26.092 --> 19:27.134
All aboard!

19:27.342 --> 19:29.322
Oh what an unfortunate wreck.

19:29.426 --> 19:31.197
Save your servants!

19:31.509 --> 19:33.072
End of Part Two!

19:42.864 --> 19:44.739
Thank you, audience, thank you.

19:44.843 --> 19:47.030
Now, excuse the delay
while we move things around

19:47.135 --> 19:49.531
and change our costumes.

19:59.010 --> 20:00.260
Good evening

20:00.677 --> 20:02.760
Forgive my boldness.

20:03.177 --> 20:04.114
I am Orestes,

20:04.218 --> 20:05.885
son of Orestes.

20:06.510 --> 20:09.531
I'm here to...

20:12.135 --> 20:15.677
I'm here to declare my love
for Hypatia, the philosopher.

20:15.781 --> 20:18.281
I mean, you all no doubt know

20:19.011 --> 20:20.990
for some time now,
following her counseling.

20:21.927 --> 20:24.011
I have devoted myself to music.

20:24.323 --> 20:27.657
In the hope of seeking solace
in the harmony of its sounds.

20:28.907 --> 20:30.053
But for me,

20:31.198 --> 20:32.032
such harmony

20:32.449 --> 20:34.844
resides only in my lady.

20:36.407 --> 20:37.553
So,

20:38.699 --> 20:40.990
My purpose here is merely to...

20:41.824 --> 20:43.386
offer my melody

20:44.324 --> 20:46.095
in the hopes of...

20:49.637 --> 20:50.782
Stop talking.

22:47.036 --> 22:49.848
That man will go far, I tell you.

22:50.369 --> 22:55.578
He's my preferred fruit for the banana
not the fig, I would have already fallen

22:55.682 --> 22:57.140
at his feet.

23:00.057 --> 23:02.141
Wouldn't it be best to please him?

23:02.870 --> 23:04.016
Me?

23:05.161 --> 23:06.063
How?

23:06.099 --> 23:09.953
Granting him your daughter's hand.
Why don't you ever plan to marry her off?

23:10.370 --> 23:14.745
Hypatia subject to a man?
Without freedom to teach?

23:15.787 --> 23:18.079
Or even to speak her mind.

23:19.016 --> 23:23.912
The most brilliant philosopher
I know, having to give up her science.

23:24.745 --> 23:27.037
No, that could be death to her.

23:30.891 --> 23:34.954
It's true.
Her work is admirable.

23:35.058 --> 23:37.767
That she's brilliant and virtuous.

23:39.537 --> 23:41.308
But Theon,

23:41.621 --> 23:44.017
She has not found her gift.

23:44.746 --> 23:46.517
Being a woman, I mean.

23:50.371 --> 23:53.496
Our Father
who art in heaven...

24:00.476 --> 24:02.455
Don't let anyone have her.

24:04.851 --> 24:08.184
Please, don't anyone else have her.

24:08.705 --> 24:13.705
Don't let anyone else have her.

24:18.705 --> 24:19.643
Amen.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.310
Good day, lady.

24:26.414 --> 24:27.768
Good day, lady.

24:28.393 --> 24:29.956
Good day, lady.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.227
Good day lady.

24:43.081 --> 24:45.112
Yesterday, many of you would
have seen one of your colleagues

24:45.322 --> 24:47.144
present me an ollos

24:48.602 --> 24:50.373
I accepted the gift.

24:50.685 --> 24:54.436
And today I wish to make him
earn a gift of my own in return.

25:06.103 --> 25:07.457
This is for you.

25:18.499 --> 25:20.686
It is the blood of my cycle.

25:24.645 --> 25:26.416
Orestes you...

25:26.937 --> 25:29.749
You say that you have
found harmony in me.

25:30.583 --> 25:32.822
Well, I am suggesting
that you look elsewhere

25:32.823 --> 25:35.895
because I think that there
is little harmony or...

25:37.145 --> 25:38.916
beauty in that.

25:41.416 --> 25:43.291
Don't you agree?

25:53.396 --> 25:56.833
Yesterday we were discussing
the Apollonian cone.

25:57.042 --> 26:00.583
We discussed the circle,
the ellipse, the parabola.

26:01.104 --> 26:03.604
Today we will discuss the hyperbola.
- Lady!

26:04.959 --> 26:06.521
Forgive me, Lady.

26:06.625 --> 26:08.084
Olympius requires your presence

26:08.188 --> 26:10.167
urgently in the Serapeum.

26:11.834 --> 26:13.188
You as well.

26:27.876 --> 26:31.105
Thank you, Lord.
Thank you, Lord.

26:31.939 --> 26:33.501
Thank you, Lord.

26:34.751 --> 26:38.189
How are we to enjoy them
force feeding us the faith

26:38.293 --> 26:42.564
and customs to people who
until recently becoming outlaws?

26:42.668 --> 26:45.376
- What's happening?
- It's despicable. A sacrilege.

26:45.413 --> 26:47.668
Christians
have gathered in the Agora.

26:47.705 --> 26:49.439
They are mocking the gods.

26:49.752 --> 26:51.835
We must put an end
these insults!

26:52.147 --> 26:53.502
They may not fear him,

26:54.127 --> 26:56.939
but they will fear our swords.

27:00.898 --> 27:01.731
Wait!

27:01.835 --> 27:02.877
Wait!

27:03.189 --> 27:05.065
Now, what is it you are going to do?

27:05.481 --> 27:07.565
Are you going to attack them?

27:07.773 --> 27:11.315
Are you going to stain your hands
with blood for an insult?

27:12.356 --> 27:15.586
To the gods!
An insult to the gods!

27:15.690 --> 27:17.409
Well, if you think it
is so outrageous then go

27:17.410 --> 27:19.544
and announce their
acts before the prefect.

27:19.648 --> 27:21.628
One might think that
you're protecting them.

27:21.836 --> 27:24.440
I am trying to protect our disciples.

27:24.857 --> 27:27.149
You, are inciting them
to be violent murderers.

27:28.294 --> 27:32.149
Theon, as director,
you have the last word.

27:37.774 --> 27:40.899
The insult must be answered.

27:41.524 --> 27:44.337
Those Jews amongst you do as
you please. This is not your battle.

27:44.441 --> 27:48.087
As for you Christians, you would
do well to join those of your own fate.

27:48.191 --> 27:51.733
You will not caused my disciples
out of this house!

27:51.837 --> 27:55.170
- Glory be to Serapis!
- And all the gods!

27:55.899 --> 27:57.670
Wait for my command!

27:57.774 --> 28:00.483
No one must suspect us
until we have them surrounded.

28:00.519 --> 28:04.441
The clubs are for the slaves.
Slaves!

28:06.004 --> 28:07.671
Slaves are all for summon!

28:10.587 --> 28:12.358
Davus, back.

28:12.462 --> 28:13.608
No. Go back.

28:14.129 --> 28:15.900
Death to Christians!

28:23.817 --> 28:25.692
Glory be to Serapis!

28:44.651 --> 28:47.672
Let's listen to her now!

28:51.109 --> 28:52.672
Do you hear any complaint?

28:52.984 --> 28:54.339
No!

28:55.276 --> 28:57.776
This one has lost her voice too!

29:02.151 --> 29:04.026
Their mouths do not speak,

29:04.235 --> 29:06.006
their eyes do not see,

29:06.214 --> 29:07.985
their nose doesn't smell.

29:09.235 --> 29:13.506
Yet still, pagans come here
and kneel before them.

29:17.777 --> 29:19.548
What madness is this?

29:26.631 --> 29:27.777
For the gods!

30:28.612 --> 30:30.071
Medorus!

30:30.175 --> 30:32.571
Take care of your master!
Protect it..!

30:35.800 --> 30:37.467
God is one!

30:46.009 --> 30:47.884
Death to the pagans!

30:52.051 --> 30:54.238
You! What are you looking at?
Get there and fight!

31:05.072 --> 31:06.218
Fight!

31:07.780 --> 31:09.759
Are you deaf?
I said fight!

31:23.927 --> 31:25.281
I'm a Christian!

31:28.406 --> 31:30.281
I am a Christian!

31:32.677 --> 31:35.177
I am a Christian!

31:42.781 --> 31:45.490
- What is Christ?
- Christ is one!

31:45.526 --> 31:47.573
Death to the pagans!

31:48.198 --> 31:49.969
God is one!

31:54.344 --> 31:56.532
No! No!

31:57.678 --> 32:01.115
The entrance!
We must defend the entrance!

32:01.532 --> 32:03.199
What's happening?

32:03.303 --> 32:05.803
Our men are being sent
back by the Christians!

32:23.512 --> 32:24.762
Father!

32:25.387 --> 32:28.512
It's alright. It's alright.

32:30.804 --> 32:32.054
What happened?

32:32.991 --> 32:34.762
It was his slave.

32:37.262 --> 32:40.075
Davus, get me some cloth
some water, quickly.

32:41.325 --> 32:42.262
Father...

32:46.221 --> 32:48.825
Synesius, we must get out of here.

32:49.033 --> 32:50.283
Hold him still.

33:04.971 --> 33:06.534
Parabolani are coming!

33:19.243 --> 33:23.201
God is with us!

33:24.034 --> 33:26.743
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

33:27.264 --> 33:29.243
- Close the gates!
- You know our men are still out there!

33:29.868 --> 33:31.847
May the gods protect them.

33:31.951 --> 33:33.722
Close the gates.. I said!

33:59.348 --> 34:04.661
Don't kill him! He'll be our hostage
like the others. Did you hear it everyone?

34:04.765 --> 34:06.952
Any Christian you
catch is now a hostage.

34:08.723 --> 34:11.639
Take our wounded to the temple
and the Christians down into the cellars.

34:12.161 --> 34:16.328
And anyone with a good eye
and a good aim up on the walls.

34:16.848 --> 34:17.786
Olympius.

34:17.994 --> 34:19.556
This one is a Christian.

34:19.661 --> 34:21.744
Yes, and those three as well.

34:22.056 --> 34:25.389
If they are Christians,
they will go down to the cellars.

34:25.495 --> 34:27.474
Olympius, if you are going
to imprison my brothers

34:27.527 --> 34:29.556
then you are going to have
to imprison me with them.

34:29.870 --> 34:32.474
If it is necessary,
I will do that.

34:33.724 --> 34:35.286
If anyone,

34:37.370 --> 34:38.411
anyone,

34:40.703 --> 34:43.411
dare lay a finger on
one of my brothers

34:44.974 --> 34:47.161
I swear I'll run in for you.

34:49.974 --> 34:51.120
Look!

34:51.954 --> 34:53.411
Look at this!

35:01.121 --> 35:02.162
Orestes.

35:03.829 --> 35:05.287
Thank you.

35:23.100 --> 35:25.288
Since when were there
so many Christians?

35:26.434 --> 35:28.205
We'll talk to them to negotiate.

35:59.872 --> 36:02.789
What are we waiting for?
What can we expect from a Christian emperor?

36:02.997 --> 36:04.768
Except we'll be put in a sword.

36:04.977 --> 36:08.935
Our sense of positive being
the life when his verdict arrives.

36:08.972 --> 36:09.768
Here will do.

36:11.123 --> 36:13.414
No one should
leave the group, please.

36:15.081 --> 36:16.956
Are they going to pray all night?

36:22.686 --> 36:24.248
Davus.

36:24.456 --> 36:25.915
Stay here.

36:26.123 --> 36:27.477
It's safer here.

36:32.998 --> 36:34.665
Just stay with him first.

37:16.958 --> 37:18.937
Synesius! What are you doing?

37:23.833 --> 37:25.604
Lady, sister and mother,

37:26.021 --> 37:28.521
May God bless you and protect you.

38:50.815 --> 38:51.857
Move back!

38:51.961 --> 38:54.253
Slaves take it to the back.

38:54.773 --> 38:56.440
Slaves get to the back!

38:58.211 --> 38:59.461
If this three one come out.

39:00.399 --> 39:02.170
It's a disaster.

39:02.274 --> 39:04.045
Father, why don't you leave the dice?

39:05.295 --> 39:07.170
Have you been seen today?

39:07.274 --> 39:09.045
- No.
- No?

39:10.607 --> 39:12.482
Let's have a look.

39:14.670 --> 39:16.128
Promise me, my child, that...

39:16.545 --> 39:20.399
when I'm gone, you won't
remember this foolish old man.

39:20.608 --> 39:21.753
I promise.

39:23.941 --> 39:26.545
Remember me as I was before.

39:28.733 --> 39:31.545
Before when I could still think and...

39:32.379 --> 39:33.837
I...

39:34.045 --> 39:36.441
work with you and...

39:37.796 --> 39:39.879
I listen to you.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.837
How could I have been so wrong?

39:45.608 --> 39:47.692
Seeing you here locked
up because of my...

39:48.004 --> 39:49.463
Father, please.

39:50.296 --> 39:52.171
I wanted you to be free.

40:00.505 --> 40:01.963
I am free.

40:05.817 --> 40:06.859
Hey, Christians.

40:07.797 --> 40:08.942
Christians!

40:09.567 --> 40:12.692
What's that confident God
of yours doing now?

40:12.797 --> 40:15.193
Maybe coffins for you, scums!

40:36.027 --> 40:37.797
So tell me.

40:37.902 --> 40:39.672
Where are the gods now?

40:41.548 --> 40:43.006
Where are they?

40:44.673 --> 40:46.964
Might as well look for others.
- Others?

40:47.381 --> 40:50.298
Which one? The God of the Christians perhaps?

40:50.714 --> 40:52.485
Such boldness!

40:56.444 --> 40:59.673
What do you think, Lady?
You are so bold.

41:04.777 --> 41:06.340
Put the fire out.

41:23.424 --> 41:24.674
You are indeed bold.

41:26.653 --> 41:27.903
Very bold.

41:28.528 --> 41:30.612
I've been thinking about
something you said to me.

41:30.716 --> 41:31.862
Me?

41:31.966 --> 41:35.612
That day that you criticize
the heavenly mechanism

41:35.716 --> 41:37.695
and you called it

41:38.841 --> 41:41.654
whimsical.
- Yes, although...

41:41.862 --> 41:43.008
Actually...

41:43.424 --> 41:44.987
I was criticizing Ptolemy.

41:45.612 --> 41:48.008
For complicating everything
with his epicycles.

41:49.466 --> 41:51.654
I don't know perhaps
I'm just simple-minded.

41:52.175 --> 41:53.112
No.

41:54.883 --> 41:56.237
No, the heavens

41:56.758 --> 41:58.112
should be simple.

42:00.404 --> 42:02.800
So am I right or..?

42:06.967 --> 42:08.321
What if...

42:11.134 --> 42:14.050
What if there were simpler
explanations for the wanderers?

42:15.717 --> 42:16.967
There is.

42:18.321 --> 42:21.446
But it is so absurd, so old.

42:21.967 --> 42:24.051
That no one gives it any credit.

42:24.155 --> 42:25.822
What theory is that?

42:26.030 --> 42:27.384
Do you think of Aristarchus?

42:27.801 --> 42:30.197
Aristarchus maintained

42:30.301 --> 42:31.863
that the earth moves.

42:32.801 --> 42:36.134
The strange behavior of the wanderers

42:36.238 --> 42:39.468
was nothing more than an optical illusion

42:39.572 --> 42:42.385
caused by our movement

42:42.489 --> 42:45.510
in combination with Earth
around the sun.

42:46.551 --> 42:49.260
- Heliocentric model.
That's right.

42:49.468 --> 42:51.239
The sun would be in the center

42:51.343 --> 42:54.572
acting as speaking of it as
"King of the Stars".

42:55.197 --> 42:59.156
It would make Earth just.. another wanderer.
- His work was lost

42:59.260 --> 43:01.448
in the fire that destroyed
the mother library.

43:02.177 --> 43:06.344
This is why we have to
take great care of this place.

43:06.864 --> 43:08.114
Our library

43:08.219 --> 43:12.385
is all that remains of
the wisdom of men.

43:12.802 --> 43:14.781
But everytime you drop an object here.

43:17.281 --> 43:18.323
Who speaks?

43:19.781 --> 43:20.927
Forgive me, Mistress.

43:24.469 --> 43:25.719
I was listening.

43:26.553 --> 43:27.907
Speak up, Davus.

43:28.532 --> 43:30.094
If the earth is moving,

43:31.657 --> 43:33.949
every time dropping
an object it would...

43:34.574 --> 43:36.032
fall further behind.

43:38.011 --> 43:40.303
And the wind would always
blow against us.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.532
And the birds would
lose their way in flight.

43:43.636 --> 43:44.886
I told you

43:44.991 --> 43:48.428
Aristarchus' hypothesis
makes no sense at all.

43:51.866 --> 43:54.678
I feel that what you just
said can be refuted.

44:01.554 --> 44:03.949
But right now I don't know how.

44:25.408 --> 44:27.492
Make way for the prefect!

44:27.804 --> 44:28.950
Make way!

44:30.200 --> 44:32.388
Make way for the prefect!

44:32.909 --> 44:34.055
Make way!

44:49.055 --> 44:50.826
Listen one and all!

44:51.972 --> 44:55.618
Prepare to hear and obey
the verdict of our Emperor.

44:59.368 --> 45:01.972
I, Flavius Theodosius Augustus

45:02.076 --> 45:06.035
Emperor and Supreme Head
of the provinces of the Orient,

45:06.139 --> 45:07.910
having been informed
of the events...

45:08.014 --> 45:11.868
which recently took place
in the City of Alexandria...

45:11.972 --> 45:13.952
do hereby declare and command

45:14.056 --> 45:16.868
that the insurgents shall
be pardoned and freed.

45:26.764 --> 45:28.952
In exchange for my generosity,

45:29.369 --> 45:34.369
the insurgents will abandon the
Serapeum and the Library immediately

45:35.098 --> 45:37.702
allowing the Christians to enter

45:37.806 --> 45:39.473
and dispose off the premises

45:41.557 --> 45:42.702
as they see fit.

45:49.890 --> 45:52.807
What are we to expect?
They'll destroy everything!

45:54.786 --> 45:56.453
Pagans will
leave by the stable.

45:56.557 --> 45:57.495
The Books.

45:57.599 --> 46:00.411
And they will be escorted
to their homes.

46:01.036 --> 46:03.224
Obey this, instant!

46:08.016 --> 46:09.474
Keep it together!

46:12.078 --> 46:14.370
Send half of the regiment
to the other side.

46:14.891 --> 46:16.453
and send the rest later.

46:16.558 --> 46:17.808
Yes, sir.

46:19.579 --> 46:20.308
Prefect.

46:20.412 --> 46:23.016
We won't be able to
contain this, not for long.

46:25.725 --> 46:27.704
On the cross! On the cross!

46:27.912 --> 46:29.683
Keep yourself together!

46:38.121 --> 46:39.788
Leave the lesser works.

46:40.308 --> 46:43.121
- Which are the lesser works?
- Just take the important ones. The important ones.

46:48.642 --> 46:50.100
The soldiers are withdrawing!

47:14.059 --> 47:14.893
Slave!

47:14.997 --> 47:17.184
- Have you seen my mistress?
- Just get over here and help!

47:25.310 --> 47:28.539
- They're not carrying so many.
We need more help.

47:32.497 --> 47:35.414
Please go and get my father
out of here. Get him out of here now.

47:43.331 --> 47:44.373
Slave!

47:45.310 --> 47:47.081
Go! Go! Go! Go!

47:48.331 --> 47:49.894
Come on, quickly!

47:52.602 --> 47:55.623
Hypatia and her students
are still in the atrium.

47:55.727 --> 47:57.082
Are they out of their minds?

47:58.644 --> 48:01.144
If that's what they want, let them burn.

48:01.873 --> 48:02.811
Come on!

48:03.228 --> 48:04.478
Quickly!

48:16.561 --> 48:17.603
Lady.

48:18.749 --> 48:20.728
Where have you been?
Pick up that sack.

48:20.832 --> 48:23.541
Lady We have to go.
- Pick up the sack!

48:26.457 --> 48:28.853
Why are slaves never around
when you needed them?

48:31.041 --> 48:33.541
I was...
- Move!, move your feet, move!

48:34.687 --> 48:35.624
Idiot!

48:54.479 --> 48:55.521
Run!

48:57.917 --> 49:00.104
There is no time!

49:02.917 --> 49:03.959
Lady!

49:05.938 --> 49:06.875
Leave them.

49:15.209 --> 49:16.667
God is one!

49:29.063 --> 49:30.105
Run!

49:40.210 --> 49:41.356
Davus!

49:42.189 --> 49:43.856
Where are you going?

49:43.960 --> 49:46.251
- We have to go!
- Davus, where are you going?

49:46.288 --> 49:48.960
If he wants to die
for our gods, let him.

49:48.996 --> 49:50.106
Please, no.
Please don't do this.

49:50.142 --> 49:51.668
- Come on!
- Davus!

49:52.189 --> 49:53.439
- Davus, no!
- Come on!

50:21.044 --> 50:22.607
God is one!

51:19.067 --> 51:23.234
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

51:39.588 --> 51:41.151
Slave!

51:45.526 --> 51:46.776
Davus!

51:48.026 --> 51:49.276
Davus!

51:51.047 --> 51:52.922
Davus the slave!

51:54.172 --> 51:55.839
Help me with this!

51:56.880 --> 51:58.026
Help me!

51:58.755 --> 52:02.714
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!

53:06.778 --> 53:07.924
Pagan sinners!

54:56.886 --> 54:59.282
The Master's wound is festering.

55:02.719 --> 55:03.865
I know.

55:07.720 --> 55:08.761
I know.

55:41.158 --> 55:42.200
Davus.

56:08.555 --> 56:09.596
Davus!

57:31.474 --> 57:32.516
You're free.

57:34.391 --> 57:35.536
Go.

57:59.704 --> 58:01.996
Hence forth, in Alexandria

58:02.621 --> 58:06.267
only Christian and Jewish
worship shall be permitted.

58:06.996 --> 58:08.246
Pagan sacrifices,

58:09.183 --> 58:10.954
worshipping pagan symbols

58:11.058 --> 58:14.809
and visiting pagan temples
shall no longer be allowed.

58:15.225 --> 58:18.871
Should anyone commit such an act or
dare raise his eyes on the statues

58:19.704 --> 58:24.184
of former gods. He shall
be punished without penance.

01:01:32.523 --> 01:01:34.294
Damn Jews!

01:01:34.398 --> 01:01:35.440
Damn Jews!

01:01:41.273 --> 01:01:44.502
They're just a bunch of good for
nothing thugs, packed animals!

01:01:45.127 --> 01:01:47.836
Joran, my dear friend, calm down.

01:01:48.982 --> 01:01:51.378
Let Bishop Cyril
speak in his own defense.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.190
Prefect

01:01:54.398 --> 01:01:56.169
our blessed parabolani,

01:01:57.107 --> 01:01:59.503
Whom he has just called

01:01:59.815 --> 01:02:01.378
the Beast of Burden.

01:02:02.003 --> 01:02:04.920
Devote themselves true
enough to carrying burdens.

01:02:05.232 --> 01:02:08.253
crippled, the sick,
the lepers...

01:02:08.461 --> 01:02:09.711
And stones!

01:02:09.816 --> 01:02:11.378
Prefect, they carry stones.

01:02:11.482 --> 01:02:12.941
And now, they burst into the theatre

01:02:13.045 --> 01:02:16.899
and stone us knowing we will
do nothing to defend ourselves.

01:02:16.936 --> 01:02:18.983
Because it is the Sabbath!

01:02:19.295 --> 01:02:21.170
On the Sabbath you
should honor God

01:02:21.274 --> 01:02:23.983
in your synagogues
instead stuffing yourselves

01:02:24.087 --> 01:02:25.649
with sweet set of theater.

01:02:26.587 --> 01:02:28.462
That is why the stones
fell upon you.

01:02:29.608 --> 01:02:33.566
Prefect, do you hear that?
Now, he's threatening us. This is too much.

01:02:33.671 --> 01:02:37.421
Friends, there are more things that unite
us than divide us.

01:02:37.525 --> 01:02:39.608
We are brothers!
We're all brothers.

01:02:40.337 --> 01:02:42.108
Where would you Christians be

01:02:42.212 --> 01:02:45.129
without the Jews?
Jesus was a Jew!

01:02:45.338 --> 01:02:47.629
Jesus was a Jew!

01:03:18.984 --> 01:03:20.859
There is.. something I find

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:22.943
disturbing in what you've told me.

01:03:23.255 --> 01:03:25.339
- What?
Well,

01:03:26.901 --> 01:03:29.818
Why does Cyril speak
of cleaning up the city?

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:32.526
Is he not satisfied with
what he already has?

01:03:32.735 --> 01:03:34.818
I think he's just trying
to frighten the Jews.

01:03:35.027 --> 01:03:36.797
But why say it in front of you?

01:03:37.318 --> 01:03:41.277
What if really he was
addressing you and not them?

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:42.214
Me?

01:03:42.423 --> 01:03:45.131
Why?
I'm as much as Christian as he is.

01:03:45.167 --> 01:03:45.912
Yes, but you forget

01:03:45.964 --> 01:03:49.506
that many of us from
your circle are not.

01:03:49.543 --> 01:03:50.965
And a full sail, prefect.

01:03:53.152 --> 01:03:54.194
Let's go.

01:03:57.423 --> 01:04:00.027
- Aspasius, you ready?
Yes, mistress.

01:04:00.131 --> 01:04:04.298
I would like you to take the sack
and climb to the top of the mast.

01:04:18.257 --> 01:04:20.549
And now, Lady,

01:04:20.653 --> 01:04:23.465
Will you finally tell me what
the point of all this is?

01:04:25.132 --> 01:04:26.382
When Aspasius

01:04:26.591 --> 01:04:29.507
drops the sack, the boat
will be moving forward.

01:04:29.716 --> 01:04:31.070
Therefore, the sack

01:04:31.174 --> 01:04:32.945
won't fall at the foot of the mast,

01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:38.153
but will fall further back.
I would say about...

01:04:42.216 --> 01:04:43.570
about here.

01:04:43.674 --> 01:04:45.445
And what is so special about that?

01:05:00.758 --> 01:05:02.529
- Yes!
- But you were wrong!

01:05:02.738 --> 01:05:04.717
Yes, but this is definite proof!

01:05:04.821 --> 01:05:06.383
It's definitive. The sack.

01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:10.446
The sack behaved as
if the boat was stationary.

01:05:10.759 --> 01:05:12.529
What does that mean?

01:05:13.884 --> 01:05:15.342
I don't know.

01:05:16.592 --> 01:05:19.092
But the same principle could
be applied to the Earth.

01:05:19.926 --> 01:05:24.092
It could be moving around
the Sun without us realizing.

01:05:25.759 --> 01:05:28.155
- Aristarchus.
Exactly.

01:05:29.613 --> 01:05:32.530
Why do you torment
yourself with that, Lady?

01:05:33.259 --> 01:05:35.655
Ptolemy's not perfect but...

01:05:35.864 --> 01:05:36.801
it works.

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:39.614
Orestes, but you are the one who...

01:05:40.759 --> 01:05:43.989
A few years ago, you weren't
so pragmatic, prefect.

01:05:44.926 --> 01:05:47.426
Well, a few years ago,
I talked first and thought later.

01:06:06.906 --> 01:06:08.677
I have Cepheus third.

01:06:11.594 --> 01:06:12.740
37.

01:06:13.573 --> 01:06:14.823
48.

01:06:18.365 --> 01:06:19.198
Venus and Mars

01:06:19.302 --> 01:06:21.386
share house in Aquarius.

01:06:25.969 --> 01:06:29.823
My father would have celebrated
such a conjunction with a good wine.

01:06:31.594 --> 01:06:33.782
The stars will not fall.
- Oh really?

01:06:34.094 --> 01:06:36.490
No, because they're fixed
to the lid of their chests.

01:06:36.907 --> 01:06:40.240
The lid will open in two hearts
and then Jesus will appear.

01:06:41.178 --> 01:06:43.053
What chest are you talking about?

01:06:44.199 --> 01:06:48.053
Don't you know that the
universe is a gigantic chest?

01:06:48.157 --> 01:06:52.116
Heaven is the lid on top
and the Earth, the ground...

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:56.699
They haven't told this fool
that the Earth is round.

01:06:57.845 --> 01:06:59.304
The Earth is flat.

01:06:59.512 --> 01:07:01.179
Your head is flat.

01:07:01.595 --> 01:07:02.741
Read the Scriptures!

01:07:02.949 --> 01:07:04.616
If the earth is round,

01:07:04.825 --> 01:07:07.741
Why don't the people at
the bottom fall off?

01:07:10.762 --> 01:07:12.741
What about the ones on the sides?

01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:14.616
Why don't they slide off?

01:07:16.804 --> 01:07:18.367
Think about that.

01:07:19.929 --> 01:07:21.179
Davus knows.

01:07:22.013 --> 01:07:23.054
Hey, brother.

01:07:23.263 --> 01:07:24.200
What do you say?

01:07:24.304 --> 01:07:27.638
Is the earth is flat or round?

01:07:30.867 --> 01:07:32.950
Only God knows those things.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.826
Leave them on the ground!

01:07:40.034 --> 01:07:42.117
Leave them on the ground!
That's where they belong.

01:07:42.534 --> 01:07:44.409
Lady, you must not lose heart.

01:07:45.034 --> 01:07:47.117
Today on the boat you made
great progress.

01:07:47.847 --> 01:07:51.493
Why do the wanderers
bury their brightness?

01:07:51.597 --> 01:07:53.993
So unexpectedly.

01:07:55.347 --> 01:07:56.909
And what is worse,

01:07:57.847 --> 01:07:59.410
Why does the sun?

01:08:00.347 --> 01:08:03.576
Why does it change size
from summer to winter?

01:08:04.201 --> 01:08:05.556
Perhaps because...

01:08:06.389 --> 01:08:08.160
sometimes it is nearer...

01:08:08.264 --> 01:08:10.035
and other times it is farther away.

01:08:11.597 --> 01:08:12.535
But Aspasius

01:08:13.681 --> 01:08:14.618
Watch.

01:08:14.931 --> 01:08:18.889
According Aristarchus, the sun must be

01:08:18.993 --> 01:08:20.868
at the center of everything.

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:23.785
With us, the Earth,

01:08:24.305 --> 01:08:27.327
traveling in a circle around it.

01:08:29.202 --> 01:08:30.243
Therefore,

01:08:30.555 --> 01:08:32.223
and this is the key.

01:08:33.786 --> 01:08:37.223
We're always at exactly...

01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:39.932
the same...

01:08:41.702 --> 01:08:42.952
distance.

01:08:43.473 --> 01:08:45.973
Now, if as you just said,
we accept the changes in distance

01:08:46.598 --> 01:08:48.368
then we are forced to add

01:08:49.411 --> 01:08:51.493
and epicycle to the Earth's orbit.

01:08:51.599 --> 01:08:55.974
So it's going to be nearer
and then it's going to be farther away.

01:08:56.807 --> 01:08:59.099
But now we fall into
the same trap as Ptolemy.

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:00.661
Circle upon circles.
- Exactly!

01:09:02.224 --> 01:09:06.182
So I just do not know
how to resolve this conflict.

01:09:10.974 --> 01:09:12.953
I mean, the only thing
we could do is...

01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:19.099
displace the sun from the
center and well...

01:09:19.203 --> 01:09:21.599
not to have a center.

01:09:21.703 --> 01:09:23.370
It breaks my heart, Aspasius.

01:09:26.183 --> 01:09:27.328
So tell me,
what do I do?

01:09:30.975 --> 01:09:32.746
Rest, lady.

01:09:45.453 --> 01:09:47.328
Parabolani!

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.142
- Parabolani!
- What is happening?

01:09:50.246 --> 01:09:53.162
Parabolani, quick!
Help!

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.246
St. Alexander's on fire!

01:09:55.663 --> 01:09:56.809
It is a fire.

01:09:58.892 --> 01:10:00.038
Come on!

01:10:03.059 --> 01:10:07.122
Gather water! Get the water!
Quick! Take this!

01:10:09.934 --> 01:10:10.663
Hurry!

01:10:12.018 --> 01:10:13.476
Quick!

01:10:16.601 --> 01:10:18.476
Come on, come on!

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:26.810
Parabolani!

01:10:27.018 --> 01:10:29.518
Parabolani!

01:10:29.727 --> 01:10:31.393
Parabolani, quick!

01:10:33.998 --> 01:10:35.560
Where's the fire?

01:10:37.435 --> 01:10:39.727
Where's the fire?

01:10:48.477 --> 01:10:49.727
Jews! It's a trap.

01:10:49.935 --> 01:10:51.394
It's a trap!

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:15.459
Christians, all.

01:12:16.605 --> 01:12:19.001
Last night was a night to deplore.

01:12:21.084 --> 01:12:22.751
Now I say to you.

01:12:24.730 --> 01:12:27.334
Grieve no longer
for our dead brothers.

01:12:28.793 --> 01:12:30.355
Weep not.

01:12:33.689 --> 01:12:35.876
Shed your tears for the others,

01:12:36.814 --> 01:12:39.001
for they are executioners.

01:12:47.647 --> 01:12:50.772
Yes, yes.

01:12:50.877 --> 01:12:53.898
Weep for them.
For those who have done this,

01:12:54.418 --> 01:12:55.981
Know not of God,

01:12:56.710 --> 01:12:59.002
nor of love nor of parity.

01:12:59.835 --> 01:13:01.466
They know not

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:03.169
because it is they

01:13:05.356 --> 01:13:08.898
who repeat the words of the Scriptures
with no understanding at all.

01:13:10.461 --> 01:13:13.481
It is they who saw
only a man

01:13:13.586 --> 01:13:16.502
when the Son of God was
standing in front of them.

01:13:16.711 --> 01:13:18.169
And it is they who in

01:13:18.273 --> 01:13:22.336
their blindness, mocked him
and crucified him.

01:13:26.815 --> 01:13:27.961
Yes

01:13:28.274 --> 01:13:31.815
Weep!
Weep for the Jews,

01:13:32.024 --> 01:13:34.732
those evil butchers
of our Lord.

01:13:37.232 --> 01:13:38.691
Because God...

01:13:40.357 --> 01:13:44.003
because God, God, God
has already condemned them.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.149
It is God's will..

01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:47.545
that they live
as slaves

01:13:48.274 --> 01:13:51.816
cursed and exiled
until the end of time.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:54.004
Cursed and exiled!

01:13:55.983 --> 01:13:57.337
Cursed and exiled!

01:14:00.254 --> 01:14:02.754
Cursed and exiled!

01:14:26.296 --> 01:14:28.380
Lady, do not stop, Lady.

01:15:17.548 --> 01:15:19.944
Now all the Jews
will want to retaliate.

01:15:20.152 --> 01:15:22.444
I'm afraid you don't understand
what's really happening.

01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:27.652
When this is all over,
there will be no more Jews in Alexandria.

01:15:34.632 --> 01:15:36.715
I'm sorry for busting in like this.

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:39.840
Lady, you should the
risk of coming here.

01:15:40.361 --> 01:15:42.028
Where are the troops?

01:15:43.382 --> 01:15:45.257
Why are there no more
soldiers on the streets?

01:15:45.361 --> 01:15:48.799
No army could contain that mob.
The entire city is in a frenzy.

01:15:51.611 --> 01:15:55.153
Calling to the annihilation
of women and children.

01:15:55.882 --> 01:15:57.028
A bishop!

01:15:57.132 --> 01:15:59.424
- A Christian!
Then lock him up.

01:16:02.966 --> 01:16:04.007
Prefect.

01:16:04.945 --> 01:16:06.612
You should have him arrested.

01:16:10.883 --> 01:16:11.924
It's not so easy.

01:16:12.445 --> 01:16:13.591
Lady,

01:16:14.112 --> 01:16:17.654
Cyril knows they both
share the same faith.

01:16:19.216 --> 01:16:21.716
That places our prefect in a very...

01:16:22.341 --> 01:16:23.591
awkward position.

01:16:24.008 --> 01:16:27.029
If he defends the Jews,
half the city will rise up

01:16:27.133 --> 01:16:28.383
against his government.

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:31.092
I see.

01:16:33.383 --> 01:16:35.779
But if you choose to do nothing now,

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:38.696
I believe Cyril will

01:16:39.113 --> 01:16:43.280
continue to do the same thing
over and over again and until...

01:16:43.696 --> 01:16:46.144
until there is no one left in this city.

01:16:46.145 --> 01:16:48.592
No people for this
government to govern.

01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:03.697
How naive of me.

01:17:06.718 --> 01:17:09.739
How naive of me to think
we have finally chose.

01:17:52.969 --> 01:17:54.532
Jews out!

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:17.762
First, they kill them

01:18:18.282 --> 01:18:19.949
then they bury them.

01:18:32.137 --> 01:18:33.908
The Bishop of Cyrene.

01:18:34.325 --> 01:18:37.033
- What is he doing here?
I'll find out.

01:18:39.429 --> 01:18:41.929
It's my little library
of Alexandria.

01:18:46.825 --> 01:18:48.700
This is where I teach the children.

01:18:51.408 --> 01:18:52.971
An Apollonian cone.

01:18:53.388 --> 01:18:56.617
Yes, I built it to teach them
about the four curves.

01:18:56.721 --> 01:18:57.867
The Circle.

01:18:59.742 --> 01:19:01.200
The ellipse.

01:19:04.013 --> 01:19:05.680
Orestes should really
be here by now.

01:19:05.784 --> 01:19:07.242
Parabola.

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:09.638
And hyperbola.

01:19:11.409 --> 01:19:12.972
It's truly beautiful.

01:19:13.909 --> 01:19:16.722
You know, I often look at it
and I always wonder

01:19:17.034 --> 01:19:19.013
why does the circle coexist with such

01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:20.993
impure shapes?

01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:26.514
When I get to sit here
and listen to you again.

01:19:26.826 --> 01:19:28.284
I bore you.

01:19:28.701 --> 01:19:30.420
It's been a long time since
I've done anything but...

01:19:30.421 --> 01:19:32.139
beat my head against a stone.

01:19:33.389 --> 01:19:36.097
Anyhow, there are more
important matters at hand.

01:19:36.514 --> 01:19:37.451
Forgive me.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.452
Two Christians in the hands
of a heathen.

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:53.910
It's an outrage!

01:20:01.619 --> 01:20:02.973
It's an outrage!

01:20:24.328 --> 01:20:27.974
- How many left?
I don't know but it smells.

01:20:34.536 --> 01:20:35.787
Ammonius.

01:20:37.245 --> 01:20:38.807
Does God speak with you?

01:20:40.787 --> 01:20:41.828
All the time.

01:20:43.078 --> 01:20:46.412
Ammonius this, Ammonius that.
Ammonius, Ammonius, Ammonius.

01:20:47.454 --> 01:20:48.912
Today, he spoke to me

01:20:49.016 --> 01:20:52.350
so quickly, I had to
ask him slow down.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.308
Tell me something.

01:20:57.975 --> 01:20:59.433
Do you ever think
we're mistaken?

01:21:02.454 --> 01:21:03.392
Why?

01:21:09.225 --> 01:21:10.788
I always forgive and...

01:21:14.017 --> 01:21:16.413
but now,
I can't forgive.

01:21:17.663 --> 01:21:18.809
Forgive?

01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:20.996
Who?

01:21:22.559 --> 01:21:23.705
The Jews?

01:21:27.351 --> 01:21:29.434
Well, Jesus pardon them on the cross.

01:21:32.247 --> 01:21:33.705
Jesus was God

01:21:34.434 --> 01:21:37.038
and only He can show
such clemency.

01:21:37.768 --> 01:21:40.684
How dare you
compare yourself to God?

01:21:44.851 --> 01:21:45.893
Brother.

01:21:49.539 --> 01:21:51.310
We are still alive.

01:21:52.456 --> 01:21:53.706
Why?

01:21:54.435 --> 01:21:55.372
Because it was

01:21:55.476 --> 01:21:58.081
His will to save us
from the stones.

01:22:00.581 --> 01:22:03.185
God wants us here,
doing what we do.

01:22:04.435 --> 01:22:06.414
Don't you believe in that anymore?

01:22:23.498 --> 01:22:24.436
My Lord...

01:22:31.415 --> 01:22:32.978
Cyril is a very proud man.

01:22:33.707 --> 01:22:37.874
He'll agree to meet, but he wouldn't
discuss the Jews, only discuss peace.

01:22:40.374 --> 01:22:41.207
Peace?

01:22:41.311 --> 01:22:45.165
My suggestion, as your
humble adviser in this affair,

01:22:45.478 --> 01:22:47.249
is for you to accept.

01:22:48.186 --> 01:22:49.541
Let peace be foremost.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.916
Lady, what do you think?
- Well.. I...

01:22:54.957 --> 01:22:56.937
I don't think it's very encouraging.

01:22:57.457 --> 01:22:59.437
Why would he want
to come and see Orestes

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:02.666
without any concrete proposals?
- And there's something else.

01:23:04.333 --> 01:23:05.791
He won't come to you.

01:23:06.624 --> 01:23:08.395
Demands he meet you in the Library,

01:23:08.916 --> 01:23:10.375
during the Sunday service.

01:23:10.687 --> 01:23:13.083
In the Library?
Why?

01:23:13.395 --> 01:23:17.250
Only Christians are being permitted
to enter the Library since it was stoned.

01:23:17.354 --> 01:23:19.437
It is a provocation!

01:23:22.458 --> 01:23:24.021
Allow me to suggest.

01:23:25.271 --> 01:23:27.250
If you consider your presence

01:23:27.354 --> 01:23:28.813
so essential

01:23:29.438 --> 01:23:31.417
why not let yourself be baptized?

01:23:34.334 --> 01:23:35.688
The majority of us here,

01:23:35.792 --> 01:23:39.021
beginning with our prefect,
have accepted Christ.

01:23:39.438 --> 01:23:41.209
Why not the rest of you?

01:23:41.730 --> 01:23:44.438
It's only a matter of
time and you know it!

01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:45.792
Really?

01:23:47.042 --> 01:23:49.334
It is just a matter of time?

01:23:49.647 --> 01:23:51.522
Well, excuse me...

01:23:51.730 --> 01:23:54.126
honored member but
as far as I'm aware

01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:56.209
your God has not yet proved himself

01:23:56.313 --> 01:23:59.543
to be more just or more merciful
than his predecessors.

01:23:59.564 --> 01:23:59.959
Lady.

01:24:00.064 --> 01:24:04.230
Is it really just a question
of time before I accept your faith?

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:06.939
Why, then,

01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:08.918
should this assembly

01:24:09.439 --> 01:24:12.876
accept the counsel of
someone who admittedly

01:24:13.606 --> 01:24:16.418
believes in absolutely nothing?

01:24:18.502 --> 01:24:20.272
I believe in philosophy.

01:24:23.398 --> 01:24:24.752
Philosophy.

01:24:25.481 --> 01:24:27.252
Just what we need

01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:29.335
in times like this.

01:24:30.377 --> 01:24:31.731
Enough!

01:24:42.773 --> 01:24:45.169
All these years, I've been studying.

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:49.440
With absolutely no life of my own.

01:24:50.065 --> 01:24:54.649
And I wonder,
what was the point?

01:24:54.753 --> 01:24:58.190
Whoa, forget about
what was said today.

01:25:01.107 --> 01:25:03.295
Is this all life holds for me?

01:25:05.378 --> 01:25:06.628
What else?

01:25:08.086 --> 01:25:10.482
I doubt anyone could see as a...

01:25:10.586 --> 01:25:11.941
devoted wife

01:25:12.045 --> 01:25:13.191
and mother.

01:25:14.232 --> 01:25:15.378
I think...

01:25:15.899 --> 01:25:19.337
I think everyone in the city
knows the story of the handkerchief.

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:24.962
So...

01:25:29.545 --> 01:25:31.316
My father loved a woman.

01:25:32.254 --> 01:25:33.504
Even he...

01:25:35.066 --> 01:25:36.629
Who have I ever loved?

01:25:40.379 --> 01:25:41.317
Except you,

01:25:41.421 --> 01:25:42.775
Libanius.

01:25:54.234 --> 01:25:55.796
If I could just...

01:25:59.546 --> 01:26:01.526
just unravel this...

01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:03.817
just a little bit more.

01:26:07.984 --> 01:26:11.630
And just get a little close
to the answer then...

01:26:11.734 --> 01:26:13.818
then I would...

01:26:15.484 --> 01:26:18.089
then I would go to my
grave a happy woman.

01:26:20.484 --> 01:26:21.630
Why?

01:26:22.255 --> 01:26:24.339
Why does that mean so much to you?

01:26:27.151 --> 01:26:28.610
Right now,

01:26:29.547 --> 01:26:33.610
this very second, the whole
Earth could be moving

01:26:33.714 --> 01:26:36.006
and no one realizes it.

01:26:36.214 --> 01:26:38.193
Except you and me.

01:26:38.297 --> 01:26:41.214
Believe me Lady, it's best
no one does.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.798
Do you really not think it important?

01:26:45.902 --> 01:26:48.610
I don't understand why you
insist on moving the ground we walk on.

01:26:49.131 --> 01:26:50.798
Well, you saw for yourself
what happened on the boat.

01:26:50.902 --> 01:26:54.652
Yes, I did. But that does not
necessarily mean the Earth moves.

01:26:55.173 --> 01:26:56.736
What if it does?

01:26:57.048 --> 01:26:59.444
Hypatia, look around you.

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:01.006
Death,

01:27:01.111 --> 01:27:02.257
horror

01:27:02.361 --> 01:27:03.819
destruction.

01:27:03.923 --> 01:27:06.944
If the stars move in a circle

01:27:07.361 --> 01:27:10.069
why would they share
their perfection with us?

01:27:12.778 --> 01:27:14.549
So we do not move...

01:27:14.653 --> 01:27:16.319
In a circle.

01:27:16.356 --> 01:27:17.986
We don't move...

01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:22.986
Circle.

01:27:24.132 --> 01:27:26.528
We do not move in a circle.

01:27:35.591 --> 01:27:37.153
Ever since Plato,

01:27:37.258 --> 01:27:41.320
all of them: Aristarchus
Hipparchus, Ptolemy,

01:27:41.633 --> 01:27:44.758
they have all tried to
reconcile their observations

01:27:44.862 --> 01:27:47.154
with circular orbits but...

01:27:47.258 --> 01:27:50.070
What if another shape
is hiding in the heavens?

01:27:50.175 --> 01:27:50.904
Another shape?

01:27:51.112 --> 01:27:55.383
Lady, there is no shape purer
than the circle. You taught us that.

01:27:55.487 --> 01:27:58.612
I know, but suppose
just suppose the...

01:27:58.821 --> 01:28:00.279
purity of the circle

01:28:00.383 --> 01:28:03.925
has blinded us from seeing
anything beyond it.

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:07.675
The same way that the glare of the sun
blind us from actually seeing the stars.

01:28:08.092 --> 01:28:10.175
I must begin all over with...

01:28:10.384 --> 01:28:12.779
with new eyes.

01:28:13.509 --> 01:28:16.634
I must rethink everything.
I have to rethink everything.

01:28:31.426 --> 01:28:34.863
Reading from the first
letter of Paul to Timothy.

01:28:35.072 --> 01:28:39.239
I desire therefore,
that everywhere

01:28:39.551 --> 01:28:42.780
men should lift up
holy hands in prayer

01:28:42.885 --> 01:28:46.531
without anger or disputing.

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:49.239
In like manner,

01:28:49.864 --> 01:28:51.947
I desire women

01:28:52.677 --> 01:28:54.552
to dress modestly,

01:28:55.281 --> 01:28:57.260
with decency and propriety

01:28:57.364 --> 01:28:59.968
not with braided hair

01:29:01.114 --> 01:29:03.198
or gold or pearls

01:29:03.302 --> 01:29:06.635
or expensive clothes,

01:29:07.989 --> 01:29:10.385
but with good deeds.
- Why is he reading this passage?

01:29:10.490 --> 01:29:15.177
I don't know, prefect.
I assure you it is not the one we agreed on.

01:29:15.802 --> 01:29:17.886
That a woman learn

01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:21.636
in quietness and in full submission.
I do not permit a woman...

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:25.490
to teach or to have authority
over a man,

01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:29.657
but to be

01:29:30.178 --> 01:29:31.949
in silence.

01:29:38.303 --> 01:29:40.595
This is the word of God!

01:29:40.803 --> 01:29:42.157
Amen.

01:29:42.782 --> 01:29:43.824
Amen.

01:29:45.907 --> 01:29:47.366
Jesus himself

01:29:47.887 --> 01:29:49.970
knew this when he

01:29:50.074 --> 01:29:53.512
entrusted his holy legacy
to twelve men

01:29:54.345 --> 01:29:55.595
Men.

01:29:56.012 --> 01:29:57.991
Not a woman among them.

01:29:59.137 --> 01:30:00.595
And yet,

01:30:01.845 --> 01:30:04.658
I know of some in Alexandria

01:30:04.762 --> 01:30:07.470
who admire and even
trust in the word of a woman.

01:30:09.241 --> 01:30:11.325
The philosopher Hypatia.

01:30:12.471 --> 01:30:14.934
A woman who declared,

01:30:14.971 --> 01:30:18.096
in public, her ungodliness.

01:30:22.367 --> 01:30:23.408
A witch!

01:30:26.846 --> 01:30:28.200
Dignitaries,

01:30:28.721 --> 01:30:33.617
it is time for you all to
reconcile yourselves with Christ.

01:30:44.242 --> 01:30:46.326
This is the word of God.

01:30:48.826 --> 01:30:51.951
Kneel before it
and embrace its truth.

01:31:34.452 --> 01:31:35.702
Kneel.

01:31:37.056 --> 01:31:39.036
Is he not going to kneel?

01:31:42.161 --> 01:31:44.557
Is he not going to kneel?

01:31:52.994 --> 01:31:54.245
Kneel!

01:31:54.349 --> 01:31:56.328
Kneel!

01:32:11.953 --> 01:32:13.933
Sinner!

01:32:15.599 --> 01:32:17.266
I am a Christian!

01:32:18.308 --> 01:32:19.870
- I am a Christian!
- You're not a Christian!

01:32:20.079 --> 01:32:22.370
I'm as Christian as you are.

01:32:22.891 --> 01:32:25.391
Make way for the prefect!

01:32:26.225 --> 01:32:27.371
Make way!

01:32:38.621 --> 01:32:40.704
I am a baptized Christian!

01:32:41.121 --> 01:32:43.309
I am a baptized Christian!

01:32:47.371 --> 01:32:49.455
I'll kill you.

01:32:54.559 --> 01:32:56.121
I am as Christian as you.

01:32:57.059 --> 01:32:59.038
I am as Christian as you are.

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:46.748
I mean, how could such
a thing be possible?

01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:49.248
The culprit has been executed.

01:33:49.769 --> 01:33:51.696
I would like you to take me
to the prefect immediately.

01:33:51.697 --> 01:33:53.623
Lady, he himself gave the order

01:33:53.727 --> 01:33:56.748
for you to be confined to
the house until further notice.

01:33:57.165 --> 01:34:00.186
At the moment your presence
on the streets is not advisable.

01:34:01.644 --> 01:34:02.790
For what reason?

01:34:05.915 --> 01:34:09.040
Cyril has made some serious
accusations against you.

01:34:11.436 --> 01:34:12.686
And um...

01:34:13.311 --> 01:34:15.499
What does he accused me of?

01:34:16.228 --> 01:34:17.686
Ungodliness...

01:34:18.416 --> 01:34:20.082
And witchcraft.

01:34:25.812 --> 01:34:27.166
I see.

01:34:38.624 --> 01:34:40.812
Is something bothering you, Lady?

01:34:41.645 --> 01:34:43.000
No.

01:34:46.541 --> 01:34:49.041
Why don't you tell me
what's worrying you?

01:35:12.063 --> 01:35:14.042
Prefect, why don't you bite on it?

01:35:16.334 --> 01:35:17.376
Speak.

01:35:17.584 --> 01:35:19.876
The Bishop of Cyrene wishes to see you.

01:35:22.688 --> 01:35:23.730
All of you...

01:35:23.834 --> 01:35:25.501
Prefect, the wound is not yet closed.

01:35:25.605 --> 01:35:28.105
Get out.
Get out!

01:35:32.584 --> 01:35:34.772
All of you out!
Out!

01:35:44.147 --> 01:35:45.918
Well, that went well.

01:35:47.481 --> 01:35:50.293
You think I had a part on this?

01:35:50.502 --> 01:35:52.273
Would I show my face here
if I wanted to betray you?

01:35:52.481 --> 01:35:56.439
- Are you blind?
I was, yes, I was blind.

01:35:57.481 --> 01:35:58.627
Well, it's my head.

01:35:58.731 --> 01:36:01.335
He's wanted all along, it's me...

01:36:01.439 --> 01:36:03.523
that snake is after.

01:36:04.252 --> 01:36:06.752
This government!

01:36:07.065 --> 01:36:08.731
This city!

01:36:10.398 --> 01:36:11.752
Now, listen.

01:36:13.627 --> 01:36:15.398
- War is brewing.
I know.

01:36:16.232 --> 01:36:17.690
I know.

01:36:20.190 --> 01:36:23.003
Do you swear your loyalty to me?

01:36:24.982 --> 01:36:26.961
To the Empire?
Do it.

01:36:30.086 --> 01:36:32.170
Condemn him or get out.

01:36:38.836 --> 01:36:40.503
I will do it.

01:36:41.337 --> 01:36:44.149
On my knees, if necessary.

01:36:44.774 --> 01:36:46.545
And not only that.

01:36:46.962 --> 01:36:49.670
In a few days, I can gather
other bishops from the province

01:36:49.671 --> 01:36:52.379
and amongst from the
desert all against Cyril.

01:37:03.525 --> 01:37:05.608
First, I must ask you a question.

01:37:06.858 --> 01:37:09.150
Orestes, do you believe in Jesus?

01:37:09.983 --> 01:37:10.712
Do I what?

01:37:10.817 --> 01:37:12.587
- Do you believe in Jesus?
- Do I what!?

01:37:12.692 --> 01:37:14.879
Are you a true Christian?

01:37:14.983 --> 01:37:18.004
Or did you like so many
others, only convert

01:37:18.108 --> 01:37:20.504
- to prosper in politics?
- Synesius.

01:37:20.609 --> 01:37:21.859
Why didn't you kneel?

01:37:21.963 --> 01:37:23.838
- What choice did I have?
- Why didn't you kneel?

01:37:23.942 --> 01:37:25.609
What choice did I have?

01:37:26.755 --> 01:37:28.734
Betray Hypatia?

01:37:29.463 --> 01:37:31.338
Condemn her?

01:37:31.442 --> 01:37:32.588
Would you have done that?

01:37:32.692 --> 01:37:34.463
I would never offend God.

01:37:34.567 --> 01:37:37.797
It's he, he is offending God.
He is offending him.

01:37:38.005 --> 01:37:41.963
He's twisting his words,
he's using the Scriptures.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.422
He read

01:37:44.151 --> 01:37:46.130
what is written.

01:37:48.109 --> 01:37:50.089
How many women do you obey?

01:37:51.234 --> 01:37:52.589
How many?

01:37:53.005 --> 01:37:55.714
How many do you
admire and listen to?

01:37:58.006 --> 01:37:59.256
Only

01:37:59.672 --> 01:38:00.818
One.

01:38:04.881 --> 01:38:06.198
Only one.

01:38:06.235 --> 01:38:08.006
The Scripture...

01:38:08.318 --> 01:38:10.818
The Scripture is correct...

01:38:12.589 --> 01:38:15.089
and it was in His hands.

01:38:17.069 --> 01:38:19.152
Brother, don't you see?

01:38:19.256 --> 01:38:21.652
Don't you see the insult to God?

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.715
In front of everyone.

01:38:29.673 --> 01:38:31.757
I don't know...

01:38:34.777 --> 01:38:36.444
I don't know what...
what I believe.

01:38:36.548 --> 01:38:38.111
You have to tell him.

01:38:38.215 --> 01:38:41.340
Go tell him now, Orestes.
Tell him you believe in what is written.

01:38:42.174 --> 01:38:44.882
Don't tell me.
Tell Him.

01:38:46.653 --> 01:38:48.424
Tell God.

01:38:48.528 --> 01:38:50.195
Kneel!

01:38:52.486 --> 01:38:54.153
Kneel!

01:39:16.445 --> 01:39:18.685
Many are those who
remember today the miracles

01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:20.925
our beloved brother
performed in life.

01:39:23.633 --> 01:39:25.925
Like the time he commended
himself to the Father

01:39:26.029 --> 01:39:29.779
and threw himself into fire
and was not even singe.

01:39:31.029 --> 01:39:32.383
Ammonius,

01:39:33.529 --> 01:39:37.071
dead of bravely defending
your faith in Christ.

01:39:39.467 --> 01:39:41.967
I proclaim you a martyr.

01:39:43.530 --> 01:39:45.196
A saint.

01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:52.592
From now on,
you shall be known as...

01:39:52.696 --> 01:39:55.197
Saint Taumasius.

01:40:08.114 --> 01:40:09.572
We want justice!

01:40:09.676 --> 01:40:12.385
Justice!

01:40:16.864 --> 01:40:18.114
May God show us the way,

01:40:18.218 --> 01:40:21.447
my dear parabolani.
Little else can I say to you.

01:40:28.427 --> 01:40:30.093
What about the monks of Nitria?

01:40:30.198 --> 01:40:32.385
We can win at least 500 of them.

01:40:32.489 --> 01:40:35.094
plus 500 of our own men...

01:40:35.198 --> 01:40:38.219
Do you think that's enough?
- He's the prefect...

01:40:38.427 --> 01:40:40.094
He has a whole army to protect him.

01:40:40.198 --> 01:40:41.552
Listen!

01:40:42.177 --> 01:40:44.573
Why don't we do something
much more simple and effective?

01:40:44.677 --> 01:40:46.344
What are you talking about?

01:40:47.073 --> 01:40:49.469
We can hurt him
where it hurts most...

01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:52.282
How?

01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:54.573
That whore.
- Who?

01:40:55.719 --> 01:40:59.886
What if we dared to look
at the world just as it is?

01:41:00.511 --> 01:41:04.261
Let us share for a moment
every preconceived idea.

01:41:04.365 --> 01:41:07.178
What shape would it show us?
What shape?

01:41:07.282 --> 01:41:11.136
You once said that the problem
lies in the inconsistency of the sun.

01:41:11.345 --> 01:41:13.220
Yes I did, good.. good
Put it into words.

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:18.949
The sun must be at the center,
since we revolve around it.

01:41:19.053 --> 01:41:20.303
And at the same time,

01:41:20.407 --> 01:41:23.949
in another position since our
distance from it varies.

01:41:24.053 --> 01:41:26.137
Yes, exactly.
- How?

01:41:33.741 --> 01:41:36.554
How could it occupy
two positions?

01:41:37.387 --> 01:41:39.783
How could I occupy
two positions at once?

01:41:41.554 --> 01:41:44.158
How could I occupy
two positions at once?

01:42:01.138 --> 01:42:02.700
Aspasius...

01:42:18.326 --> 01:42:21.034
Yes, yes. There.
And then the other one here.

01:42:21.138 --> 01:42:23.430
Keeping the same proportion.

01:42:26.764 --> 01:42:29.576
Good. Very good.
Now, tie this end to that torch.

01:42:36.868 --> 01:42:38.014
Aspasius.

01:42:38.535 --> 01:42:40.931
I want you to imagine
that this is the Earth.

01:42:41.139 --> 01:42:42.702
And that each of these flames represent

01:42:42.807 --> 01:42:45.410
the two extreme positions
of the sun in relation to it.

01:42:45.514 --> 01:42:47.285
In winter and in summer.

01:42:48.014 --> 01:42:52.285
What would happen if both
these positions with the two centers

01:42:52.598 --> 01:42:54.160
of one and the same circle?

01:42:54.994 --> 01:42:56.765
But it is impossible, mistress.

01:42:56.869 --> 01:42:59.577
Wait. What do we know about a circle?
We know that the center of a circle

01:42:59.681 --> 01:43:02.702
is always the same distance
from any point along its perimeter.

01:43:02.806 --> 01:43:03.640
- Exactly.
Yes, so...

01:43:03.744 --> 01:43:05.723
What if I divide the center into two...

01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:11.140
but what I keep constant is the sum
of their two distances to the perimeter.

01:43:12.911 --> 01:43:16.557
Alright, look. I'll show you.
Watch. As I move this rod along

01:43:16.661 --> 01:43:19.161
the cord,
as one segment increases

01:43:19.265 --> 01:43:21.557
the other segment decreases,
and vice versa.

01:43:22.494 --> 01:43:25.411
Therefore the sum of the two
is always going to be constant.

01:43:25.515 --> 01:43:26.974
Do you see that?

01:43:27.078 --> 01:43:33.849
Now, what if we apply this
to the movement of the Earth?

01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:49.474
What...

01:43:52.495 --> 01:43:53.954
figure...

01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:56.454
will be obtained?

01:43:59.891 --> 01:44:01.454
An ellipse!

01:44:01.975 --> 01:44:05.829
With the sun at one of its foci.

01:44:07.287 --> 01:44:08.954
Because,

01:44:09.371 --> 01:44:11.142
what is a circle except

01:44:11.246 --> 01:44:13.434
a very special ellipse

01:44:13.538 --> 01:44:17.392
whose foci have joined so close
together that they appear to be one.

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.371
Perhaps, I'm completely raving, Aspasius.

01:44:24.476 --> 01:44:28.226
I mean, why should this be so?
Maybe I'm just...

01:44:28.746 --> 01:44:30.205
Maybe I'm...

01:44:40.518 --> 01:44:41.976
What do you think?

01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:49.893
It could well be solved, mistress.

01:44:59.789 --> 01:45:02.706
Well done, we'll continue
with this tomorrow.

01:45:03.331 --> 01:45:04.893
Get some sleep.

01:45:04.998 --> 01:45:06.456
Good night, mistress.
Good night.

01:45:08.748 --> 01:45:09.894
Thank you.

01:46:21.979 --> 01:46:23.229
Davus!

01:46:26.563 --> 01:46:27.917
Davus!

01:46:32.084 --> 01:46:33.646
What are you doing?

01:46:56.876 --> 01:46:58.230
Lady.

01:46:59.689 --> 01:47:01.459
Let me see.

01:47:02.501 --> 01:47:04.168
Why don't you sit down?

01:47:07.605 --> 01:47:09.168
Where is everybody?

01:47:09.272 --> 01:47:11.043
Please sit down.

01:47:11.876 --> 01:47:13.126
I have..

01:47:13.231 --> 01:47:15.001
I have news for you too.

01:47:22.918 --> 01:47:24.585
All dignitaries

01:47:24.689 --> 01:47:27.085
who have yet to embrace
the Christian faith

01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:29.481
are to be baptized

01:47:30.627 --> 01:47:31.981
in public.

01:47:36.565 --> 01:47:38.023
The aim very clear:

01:47:38.127 --> 01:47:42.815
It's to add to our cause,
all the Christians in the city

01:47:45.002 --> 01:47:47.502
decent folk, better

01:47:47.711 --> 01:47:50.003
to fight for me.

01:47:52.190 --> 01:47:54.378
You speak of battling faith.

01:48:03.857 --> 01:48:05.107
Very well.

01:48:07.086 --> 01:48:09.430
It seems everything seems to
have been decided already.

01:48:09.431 --> 01:48:12.399
I don't understand why you
required my presence here.

01:48:28.025 --> 01:48:29.900
I am not a member of government.

01:48:30.004 --> 01:48:33.754
No, you are more than that.
You are the person I trust most

01:48:33.858 --> 01:48:35.525
and everyone knows it.

01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:37.608
What can I say?

01:48:46.150 --> 01:48:47.192
Lady.

01:48:50.317 --> 01:48:52.088
Many years ago,

01:48:54.379 --> 01:48:56.567
years ago, you taught us something.

01:48:57.505 --> 01:48:58.859
If...

01:48:59.067 --> 01:49:01.359
If two are...

01:49:01.567 --> 01:49:03.338
equal to a third they are...

01:49:03.546 --> 01:49:05.630
all are equal to each other.
Do you remember?

01:49:05.734 --> 01:49:06.463
Yes

01:49:06.567 --> 01:49:09.484
The three of us,
we are all good people.

01:49:09.588 --> 01:49:13.234
And you, you are as
Christian as we are!

01:49:17.818 --> 01:49:20.943
Synesius, you don't question
what you believe.

01:49:22.922 --> 01:49:24.693
You cannot.

01:49:28.131 --> 01:49:29.589
I must.

01:49:38.235 --> 01:49:39.277
Well...

01:49:41.985 --> 01:49:43.548
That's a pity,

01:49:43.756 --> 01:49:44.694
Lady.

01:49:44.798 --> 01:49:46.777
A great pity.

01:49:48.339 --> 01:49:50.215
Our revered teacher

01:49:50.319 --> 01:49:53.548
taken away from what
she herself taught us.

01:49:54.798 --> 01:49:57.194
Or do you think I'm not aware
of the insane things you invoke.

01:49:57.298 --> 01:50:00.632
- Synesius!
With Earth moving around the Sun.

01:50:01.882 --> 01:50:03.757
What next, Lady, what next?

01:50:05.215 --> 01:50:06.882
You must let me go.

01:50:07.507 --> 01:50:09.137
Let me in!

01:50:09.173 --> 01:50:11.778
- I'll go straight to her.
- Why does she wanna see a parabolani?

01:50:11.882 --> 01:50:15.007
- Lady!
Go away before we arrest you.

01:50:15.632 --> 01:50:17.715
- Leave!
- Aspasius!

01:50:18.028 --> 01:50:20.840
It's me, Davus.
Get off me.

01:50:21.153 --> 01:50:22.924
- Tell them who I am
- I know this man, please.

01:50:23.132 --> 01:50:24.278
What do you want?

01:50:24.382 --> 01:50:27.195
I need to speak to her. I need to
speak to the mistress. Where is she?

01:50:27.299 --> 01:50:30.007
Mistress is not here.
- It's urgent! Where is she?

01:50:30.737 --> 01:50:31.987
She's at the prefect's palace.

01:50:32.091 --> 01:50:33.758
- Where?
- The prefect palace!

01:50:33.862 --> 01:50:36.883
Prefect's palace. Thank you.
- Get out of here.

01:50:38.445 --> 01:50:39.487
Who was that?

01:50:40.945 --> 01:50:42.716
He was a slave once.

01:50:48.862 --> 01:50:51.883
Wait, please!
Wait! I beg you.

01:51:01.154 --> 01:51:05.946
If you don't agree, I won't be
able to protect you any longer.

01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:10.529
I won't be able to
have dealings with you

01:51:11.779 --> 01:51:13.759
neither greet you.

01:51:16.467 --> 01:51:17.821
Hypatia.

01:51:19.176 --> 01:51:20.738
Don't you see?

01:51:21.467 --> 01:51:23.863
I can't go on without you.

01:51:25.009 --> 01:51:26.363
I cannot.

01:51:32.405 --> 01:51:34.489
Without you, I can't
defeat Cyril.

01:51:36.155 --> 01:51:37.614
Orestes.

01:51:44.072 --> 01:51:46.051
Cyril has already won.

01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:05.010
Thank you.

01:52:05.219 --> 01:52:06.989
I do not need you.

01:52:35.532 --> 01:52:36.574
Davus!

01:52:39.178 --> 01:52:41.574
Brother! Where are you going?

01:52:41.886 --> 01:52:43.241
We found her!

01:53:27.409 --> 01:53:28.971
Come on, walk!

01:53:29.179 --> 01:53:30.742
Move it, sinner!

01:53:34.284 --> 01:53:36.159
Whore!

01:53:46.888 --> 01:53:47.722
Witch!

01:53:50.118 --> 01:53:51.263
Pagan sinner!

01:54:04.806 --> 01:54:08.139
Move! Come on!

01:54:10.431 --> 01:54:11.577
Witch!

01:54:34.702 --> 01:54:36.265
Strip her naked!

01:54:45.536 --> 01:54:46.578
Get up.

01:54:48.974 --> 01:54:53.140
That's it. So that God can behold
in all your filth, whore.

01:54:53.245 --> 01:54:55.328
The way you knock
the prefect so hard.

01:54:55.432 --> 01:54:56.786
Heathen!

01:54:57.515 --> 01:54:58.557
Whore.

01:54:58.661 --> 01:54:59.391
Look,

01:54:59.495 --> 01:55:01.057
she's not reacting.

01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:04.599
She will scream all right
when we skin her alive.

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:07.203
How many of you have knives?
- None.

01:55:11.266 --> 01:55:13.558
Don't stain your hands
with impure blood.

01:55:15.954 --> 01:55:17.412
Let's stone her!

01:55:17.829 --> 01:55:20.745
Let's stone this witch!
- Get some stones.

01:55:21.787 --> 01:55:23.558
- Quickly!
The ones we throw at Orestes.

01:55:23.662 --> 01:55:24.704
they are still here.

01:55:24.808 --> 01:55:27.100
I'll stay with her.

01:57:33.041 --> 01:57:33.917
She fainted.

01:58:08.649 --> 01:58:10.572
The body of Hypatia was mutilated
and the remains...

01:58:10.673 --> 01:58:12.596
...were dragged through the streets
and burned in a fire.

01:58:12.697 --> 01:58:14.620
Orestes was outlawed forever
and Cyril...

01:58:14.721 --> 01:58:16.904
...took control of the power
in Alexandria.

01:58:20.322 --> 01:58:24.405
Later, Cyril was declared a Saint
and Doctor of the Church.

01:58:28.484 --> 01:58:32.835
Although not any of Hypatia works
remains,

01:58:32.936 --> 01:58:34.859
it is known that she was an
exceptional astronomer,

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:36.758
well-known for the mathematical
study of conical curves.

01:58:41.681 --> 01:58:44.979
One thousand, two hundred years later,

01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:47.003
in the 17th century, astronomer
Johannes Kepler...

01:58:47.104 --> 01:58:49.027
...described that one of those curves,...

01:58:49.128 --> 01:58:50.615
...the ellipse, governs the movement
of the planets.
