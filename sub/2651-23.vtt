WEBVTT

00:03.113 --> 00:05.672
Family fun meeting
by the front door, stat!

00:06.991 --> 00:09.903
- "Stat" means right now!
- What is it?

00:09.990 --> 00:13.186
Ignore her. She's been in a bad mood
all day, and Luke isn't home yet.

00:13.267 --> 00:16.065
- I'm right here.
- Where were you?

00:16.146 --> 00:17.818
This house still holds
its secrets.

00:17.905 --> 00:20.215
You're probably wondering
why I called you all here.

00:20.305 --> 00:22.215
- Nope.
- Well, stop your wondering-

00:22.304 --> 00:25.181
- We're not wondering.
...and behold this wonder!

00:25.263 --> 00:26.776
- Oh, my God!
- Wow.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.374
Seriously?

00:28.461 --> 00:30.690
I sold a home to the one
and only Pete Johnson.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.259
There's only one Pete Johnson?

00:32.338 --> 00:35.171
Only one who's
California's top R.V. dealer.

00:35.257 --> 00:38.250
There's 835 others.
Nightmare of a deal to paper.

00:38.337 --> 00:39.974
Well, and this
was his way of saying-

00:40.096 --> 00:41.528
- Thank you.
- Of course.

00:41.614 --> 00:43.129
He paid a commission
too, right?

00:43.214 --> 00:45.852
Yes. And he told me
I could take Jolene out anytime.

00:45.972 --> 00:47.407
Yeah, I named her.

00:47.493 --> 00:49.926
Let's take this dirty girl
for a spin up the coast.

00:50.011 --> 00:51.210
Yes!

00:51.290 --> 00:52.849
Awesome!
Pretty sweet, huh?

00:52.969 --> 00:54.449
Yeah! Huh.

00:54.528 --> 00:56.248
Oh, I can see where
this is going.

00:56.329 --> 00:59.160
This summer,
you, me, the kids-

00:59.286 --> 01:01.242
Yellowstone National Park.
Mmm.

01:01.326 --> 01:03.964
And that's just a Verona.
He offered me an Amalfi.

01:04.045 --> 01:05.557
An Amalfi, Claire.

01:05.643 --> 01:07.760
That makes the Umbria
look like a Portofino.

01:07.842 --> 01:09.356
Well, they should've
called it the Roman,

01:09.443 --> 01:11.673
'cause that's what
we're about to be doin'.

01:11.762 --> 01:14.115
I'm really not following you.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.832
Ten days on the road
with those kids?

01:15.919 --> 01:17.433
Winnebag-no.

01:17.518 --> 01:20.238
I hate it when Phil does this,
and I have to be the bad guy...

01:20.318 --> 01:22.956
who comes in and squelches
his brilliant idea.

01:23.075 --> 01:25.384
I said no.
Get it out of my house.

01:25.475 --> 01:27.068
Fine.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.633
Come on, Jolene.

01:30.072 --> 01:33.224
Fortunately, this time,
I don't have to be the wet blanket,

01:33.312 --> 01:35.746
because even on just
a short spin up the coast,

01:35.830 --> 01:38.548
Phil will see what I see
every day-

01:38.669 --> 01:40.103
the transformation
that happens...

01:40.188 --> 01:42.701
when our kids are locked
in a moving metal box.

01:42.786 --> 01:46.063
The kraken that is unleashed.

01:46.146 --> 01:47.818
I love my kids very, very much.

01:48.784 --> 01:49.531
♪ Hey, hey ♪

01:56.861 --> 01:58.179
♪ Hey♪
♪

02:00.618 --> 02:02.450
You're poking me. Yeah,
well, I know, sweetie,

02:02.537 --> 02:04.138
but if I don't get
these pins just right,

02:04.177 --> 02:06.936
your bun could fall out during your
routine, and it could mess you up.

02:07.016 --> 02:10.086
Okay, let's test it out.
All right.

02:10.174 --> 02:13.133
Jump. Good. Spin.

02:13.213 --> 02:16.204
Now give me Beyoncé.

02:16.292 --> 02:18.407
Okay, I've done everything
I can do. It's up to you now.

02:18.490 --> 02:20.004
We have a gymnast
in our family.

02:20.089 --> 02:21.603
Yeah, Lily goes
to gymnastics class.

02:21.690 --> 02:23.441
In one short year,
I've seen her blossom...

02:23.569 --> 02:25.878
from a little girl who
couldn't do a somersault-

02:25.968 --> 02:27.959
Into one who...
kind of can.

02:28.046 --> 02:30.037
Yeah, and by that standard,
we also have a black belt,

02:30.126 --> 02:32.594
art prodigy and prima ballerina
in our family.

02:32.685 --> 02:35.356
You know what we don't have in our family
is two loving, supportive fathers.

02:35.443 --> 02:36.882
I'm just saying she's five,
you know?

02:37.003 --> 02:39.039
And you never let her forget it.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.840
Excuse me. Is that your
little girl out there? It is.

02:41.919 --> 02:43.717
- And you did her hair?
- I did.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.471
Do you mind helping my Julie
with hers?

02:46.558 --> 02:48.434
Oh. Oh, do you guys own
a convertible?

02:48.557 --> 02:50.434
No.
Oh, no judgment.

02:50.515 --> 02:53.508
Yeah, I'll get to work
right when Lily's done.

02:59.233 --> 03:01.700
Not bad. That little leap
at the end-that's new.

03:01.791 --> 03:03.701
Wow. She's getting
really good.

03:03.790 --> 03:05.667
You better bring
your "A" game.

03:05.749 --> 03:09.424
Oh, my God. Cam, look.
Lily's in second place-9.2.

03:09.508 --> 03:11.976
I told you she's a gymnast. With scores
like that, she's gonna make pre-team.

03:12.107 --> 03:13.381
Are you serious?
Mm-hmm.

03:13.465 --> 03:15.501
Pre-team? She could make pre-
What's pre-team?

03:17.104 --> 03:18.583
Claire!

03:18.664 --> 03:19.983
Phil!

03:20.062 --> 03:21.290
Haley!

03:21.382 --> 03:22.657
Luke!

03:22.741 --> 03:24.221
Alex!

03:24.300 --> 03:25.939
Gloria, we've been through
the roster three times.

03:26.059 --> 03:27.619
They're not home.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.338
But their cars are here.
Where could they be?

03:29.419 --> 03:30.932
Who knows what these people do?

03:31.017 --> 03:32.417
Well, my backpack
is in there, Jay.

03:32.537 --> 03:34.097
My poem for my poetry reading.
Calm down.

03:34.136 --> 03:35.694
Didn't you back it up
on your computer?

03:35.816 --> 03:37.646
What kind of man writes
poetry on a computer?

03:37.775 --> 03:39.969
You could've ended that sentence
after "poetry."

03:41.933 --> 03:45.243
Come in. And no questions.

03:46.931 --> 03:49.410
My backpack wasn't upstairs.

03:49.489 --> 03:52.400
What's that? Postcard from a
friend of Claire's-Rachel.

03:52.487 --> 03:55.320
"Living it up
in Club Med Cozumel."

03:55.407 --> 03:57.443
Looks like that marriage
went down the drain.

03:57.526 --> 03:58.959
In other shocking news,

03:59.044 --> 04:01.684
Phil subscribes
to a trampoline magazine.

04:01.764 --> 04:04.960
Going through other people's mail.
Keeping it classy, Jay.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.994
Mom, my backpack
isn't in Luke's room.

04:07.082 --> 04:09.197
I don't
see it in here, either.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.760
I don't think it would fit
in there.

04:10.839 --> 04:13.229
Ay, this was open
when I came in.

04:13.318 --> 04:15.468
I was just looking
for an aspirin.

04:15.557 --> 04:17.548
I thought that I heard
some noises.

04:17.676 --> 04:19.985
So you were snooping. Oh,
so now it's snooping-

04:20.076 --> 04:21.952
wanting to know more
about your family...

04:22.034 --> 04:24.105
by looking through
their personal things?

04:24.194 --> 04:26.832
Not just now.
Since the invention of things.

04:26.912 --> 04:28.630
Is that
one of Claire's brownies?

04:28.711 --> 04:30.304
No. They're delicious.
Must be Cam's.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.426
Oh, no. Don't worry.
There's more.

04:32.510 --> 04:34.944
No! That's where
my backpack is.

04:35.028 --> 04:38.338
Cam drove me and Luke home.
I must've left it in his car.

04:38.427 --> 04:39.906
Why are you
so scattered lately?

04:39.987 --> 04:43.820
Aw, he's just nervous
because of his poetry reading tonight.

04:43.904 --> 04:45.417
But don't worry, papi.

04:45.504 --> 04:48.301
I am going to be there
to support you.

04:48.383 --> 04:50.180
I don't want my mom there.

04:50.261 --> 04:53.492
I'm exploring some darker themes
I'm not sure she's ready for.

04:53.579 --> 04:56.299
Poems like
"The Umbilical Noose,"

04:56.379 --> 04:57.858
"A Jail Called Mom,"

04:57.938 --> 04:59.815
"Smother Nature."

04:59.897 --> 05:02.536
She'll just find some way
to make it all about her.

05:04.215 --> 05:07.844
And a toasty 75 degrees
for daughter Haley.

05:09.533 --> 05:12.888
You see, the Verona boasts
individualized climate zones, Claire.

05:12.972 --> 05:16.646
- Mmm. - I could literally transport
a polar bear and an orchid...

05:16.769 --> 05:19.284
- and not make two trips.
- Mmm!

05:19.369 --> 05:21.927
Dad, I'm freezing.
It's like one degree back here.

05:23.206 --> 05:26.482
Six minutes in and it begins.

05:26.564 --> 05:28.283
Here. Take the blanket
from the bed.

05:28.365 --> 05:31.480
- Thanks, kitten.
- Dad, can you change the music?

05:31.562 --> 05:33.633
Can I?

05:33.722 --> 05:35.401
Oh, no. Oh, no,
that's just getting louder.

05:35.481 --> 05:38.040
This isn't good.
It's not good at all.

05:38.119 --> 05:39.553
Actually,
it's kind of perfect.

05:39.638 --> 05:42.790
Right? The big windows,
the classical music.

05:42.877 --> 05:44.630
It's like we're in a movie.

05:44.756 --> 05:47.031
Turn it up, handsome.
You got it.

05:50.633 --> 05:53.785
Obviously, the novelty of the situation
was delaying the inevitable.

05:53.872 --> 05:56.386
But I didn't want to get halfway
into a trip to Yellowstone...

05:56.472 --> 06:00.304
before Phil discovered what malevolent
hell spawn we have for children-

06:00.390 --> 06:02.425
whom I love very much.

06:04.307 --> 06:05.979
Alex, honey,
that's a cute sweater.

06:06.106 --> 06:08.545
- Doesn't Haley have one like that?
- Oh, it actually is hers.

06:08.586 --> 06:10.224
I took it from her closet
before we left. Really?

06:10.304 --> 06:13.137
Oh. Sorry, girls. Didn't
mean to start a whole thing.

06:13.223 --> 06:17.375
I am so sick of you always
looking better in my clothes.

06:17.462 --> 06:20.100
- When did that happen?
- You're okay with this?

06:20.180 --> 06:23.140
Oh, yeah. She can wear whatever she
wants after I've had it for six months.

06:23.179 --> 06:24.692
- Oh.
- Or I get it automatically...

06:24.778 --> 06:26.212
if you buy anything
that looks like it.

06:26.297 --> 06:29.050
This just feels right.
Huh, team?

06:29.137 --> 06:31.128
Matter of fact,
I was thinking...

06:31.215 --> 06:33.411
we could all drive up
to Yellowstone this summer,

06:33.494 --> 06:37.965
but I say let's take
this beeyotch ocean to ocean.

06:38.092 --> 06:39.764
That'd be cool.
Awesome.

06:39.851 --> 06:41.410
We're doing it.

06:41.490 --> 06:43.243
Phil, the road!

06:46.648 --> 06:50.925
I don't know what button I just
pressed, but that was amazing.

06:55.644 --> 06:57.283
My backpack's definitely
not in there.

06:57.364 --> 06:58.876
Well, they're not picking up
their phone.

06:58.962 --> 07:00.634
He must've brought it inside.

07:00.761 --> 07:02.912
Sorry, kid. Looks like
you're out of luck.

07:03.001 --> 07:05.993
- Come.
- Don't they have a burglar alarm?

07:06.079 --> 07:07.354
Ay, please.

07:08.479 --> 07:10.435
Okay, everybody,
split up and search.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.667
Jay, you look in the bedroom. I'm
not looking in their bedroom.

07:12.756 --> 07:16.065
Fine. Mom, I don't think
my backpack is in Cam's bag.

07:16.154 --> 07:19.066
I was just closing it for him.
I heard a noise.

07:19.153 --> 07:21.110
Looks like the guys
threw a little party.

07:21.192 --> 07:23.831
I noticed. They brought
out the guest soaps.

07:23.912 --> 07:25.789
How long have you been in here?

07:25.871 --> 07:29.067
Hey. This is that bottle
of wine I bought Phil...

07:29.148 --> 07:30.583
when he started his company.

07:30.669 --> 07:33.660
And Claire's lipstick is on
many of these wine glasses.

07:33.746 --> 07:35.261
Pictionary.
They had game night?

07:35.347 --> 07:37.781
But we always go to game night.

07:37.905 --> 07:40.816
Son of a bitch.
They snubbed us.

07:40.904 --> 07:42.099
Found it!

07:42.183 --> 07:44.777
There must've been
a dozen players.

07:44.862 --> 07:46.342
Pepper was here.

07:47.421 --> 07:49.376
But Pepper loves me.

07:49.459 --> 07:50.939
Okay, she's all set.

07:51.020 --> 07:53.056
I defy you to find a tighter bun
in this gymnasium.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.288
Lot of different ways
you could've said that.

07:55.417 --> 07:58.216
Oh, and good luck on your floor routine, sweetie.
Not that you need it.

07:59.934 --> 08:01.891
That's Abby.
She's the best in class.

08:02.014 --> 08:03.527
Oh.
She's our competition.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.213
I've never wanted
to beat a kid so badly.

08:05.333 --> 08:07.767
- Are you not hearing these? No.
- Okay.

08:07.852 --> 08:09.569
Oh, Lily's on the beam.

08:09.651 --> 08:12.290
I'm nervous about her dismount. You said
that she could stick the landing, right?

08:12.369 --> 08:15.917
Yeah, as long as she breathes, relies
on her training and stays in the zone.

08:16.008 --> 08:17.964
We are talking about her
stepping off a six-inch beam.

08:18.046 --> 08:20.605
And not falling. Right.

08:20.685 --> 08:24.598
I have to admit seeing Lily do so
well brought out something in me.

08:24.723 --> 08:26.441
The pride of being a parent
of a child...

08:26.523 --> 08:29.481
who wasn't just participating
but thriving.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.830
- Okay, here comes her dismount.
- Stick it, Lily. Stick it!

08:37.878 --> 08:39.515
She stuck it!

08:39.597 --> 08:41.236
Mmm!
She stuck it.

08:41.357 --> 08:42.583
Whoo!

08:42.674 --> 08:44.073
9.4.

08:44.154 --> 08:46.066
If no one beat
my daughter's score on the beam,

08:46.193 --> 08:48.388
she would make pre-team.

08:48.473 --> 08:50.589
She'd be one of the elites.

08:50.671 --> 08:53.310
Funny thing, pride.

08:53.391 --> 08:56.144
They say it goeth
before the-

08:56.230 --> 08:58.220
Fall. Fall. Fall.

08:58.308 --> 09:00.902
Mitchell, I can hear you rooting
for a little girl to fall.

09:00.988 --> 09:03.058
If I can hear you,
other people can hear you.

09:03.146 --> 09:04.626
Yes!

09:04.746 --> 09:06.497
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.

09:06.585 --> 09:08.063
Yeah. He didn't mean it.

09:08.183 --> 09:10.253
I didn't mean it. No, um,
he just got caught up.

09:10.343 --> 09:14.573
And, uh, you know-We all know competition
makes people do crazy things, so-

09:14.660 --> 09:17.129
Look at this! Her bun fell apart
during the floor exercise.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.494
Her hair got in her eyes, and
she couldn't even finish.

09:19.579 --> 09:21.376
You did it on purpose!

09:21.498 --> 09:22.567
No!
Daddies!

09:22.657 --> 09:24.250
I'm in first place.

09:24.377 --> 09:26.935
Yay.
That's great.

09:30.254 --> 09:33.212
- Did you offend them?
- Me? They love me.

09:33.292 --> 09:36.362
Can we go now?
I have a poetry reading tonight.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.918
And speaking of that, are you
sure you guys really want-

09:39.009 --> 09:42.604
It makes no sense. We're always
the life of every party.

09:42.689 --> 09:45.281
Maybe they didn't invite you
because you're a couple of snoops?

09:45.367 --> 09:47.562
Okay, Mr. Goody Two-shoes.

09:47.686 --> 09:49.404
A trait normal parents
would value.

09:51.763 --> 09:53.436
Jay, I think you're
right about him.

09:53.564 --> 09:56.077
He's been too good lately
for a teenager.

09:56.161 --> 09:57.675
It's not normal.

09:57.761 --> 09:59.399
I am afraid that the world
is going to-

09:59.520 --> 10:01.671
Oh, hell, no. This is too far.
Ay.

10:01.759 --> 10:03.239
Look at this.

10:04.479 --> 10:07.116
Is that supposed to be-
That's us.

10:07.237 --> 10:08.751
Not only do we get blown off,

10:08.837 --> 10:10.509
now they're making fun of us.

10:10.596 --> 10:13.553
Well, I'm just gonna leave them
a little message.

10:15.273 --> 10:19.903
As far as I'm concerned,
they can all-

10:19.991 --> 10:21.345
Ha!

10:23.109 --> 10:25.021
Horse mouth!
That's a good one!

10:25.108 --> 10:26.939
Horse mouth
is not an expression.

10:27.027 --> 10:30.303
You can't get this?
Look. Donkey.

10:30.427 --> 10:32.657
That's not a donkey.
Look at the ears.

10:32.745 --> 10:34.542
Okay. Donkey mouth.

10:34.624 --> 10:36.183
That's a terrible guess.

10:36.263 --> 10:37.822
That's a terrible drawing!

10:37.943 --> 10:40.298
Hello? We weren't invited
because you stink at this game.

10:40.422 --> 10:41.856
At least I can draw.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.455
Excuse me.
Just need a signature.

10:43.541 --> 10:45.179
Yeah, sure.

10:48.098 --> 10:50.248
Okay.

10:50.338 --> 10:51.851
Here we go.

10:51.976 --> 10:53.888
There. Thank you.
Yep.

10:55.295 --> 10:57.172
That's not a signature.
You drew a cat.

10:57.254 --> 10:58.733
Thank you.

11:06.969 --> 11:09.279
Perfect freaking harmony.

11:09.368 --> 11:10.881
That's when it hit me.

11:10.967 --> 11:13.640
Maybe it's not the cold confines
of a moving vehicle...

11:13.726 --> 11:15.398
that brings out
the worst in my kids.

11:15.526 --> 11:18.597
Maybe I bring out
the worst in them...

11:18.685 --> 11:22.472
when there's no fun-lovin' Phil around
to neutralize my toxins.

11:22.563 --> 11:24.440
I was in a full shame spiral.

11:24.522 --> 11:26.000
Oh! A bee!

11:26.080 --> 11:28.753
And then something
wonderful happened.

11:28.839 --> 11:30.955
I got it!
Ow! You idiot!

11:31.039 --> 11:33.029
Kill it!
No, don't!

11:33.158 --> 11:35.625
Haven't you heard of colony collapse?
Bees are endangered.

11:35.716 --> 11:38.470
Okay, guys, stand still. It can't
see you if you're not moving.

11:38.595 --> 11:40.392
It's coming near me! ♪
♪

11:40.474 --> 11:43.386
Do I look like a bee?
No! It was an accident!

11:43.473 --> 11:44.986
Well, so is this!

11:47.272 --> 11:51.025
Everyone remain calm. I'll just open
up the double-tilt Swiss skylight,

11:51.150 --> 11:53.823
and the airflow will pull the bee out of-Aaah!
There's another bee now!

11:53.948 --> 11:57.065
We must be near its cave! Oh, my God!
There's so much stupid in here!

11:57.147 --> 11:58.667
All right, I'm pulling
this thing over.

11:58.746 --> 12:00.225
Those are the wipers.

12:00.306 --> 12:01.785
Claire, say something.

12:01.905 --> 12:04.578
Kids, stop, please.

12:04.664 --> 12:07.576
Hey, there are daily flights
to Yellowstone.

12:09.422 --> 12:12.253
You ripped my sweater! My sweater,
which you shouldn't even be wearing.

12:12.380 --> 12:15.337
Get off of my sweater!
Short layover in Salt Lake.

12:15.419 --> 12:17.136
Are you really not
gonna do anything?

12:17.217 --> 12:19.731
Oh, Phil, you must have known
this was gonna happen.

12:19.816 --> 12:21.694
I know that tone.
You're making a point.

12:21.776 --> 12:24.084
It's better that you find out
who they are now...

12:24.175 --> 12:25.894
than when you're halfway
across the country.

12:27.653 --> 12:29.961
I guess I'm just a naive boob
who thought we liked each other.

12:30.091 --> 12:32.047
Obviously, it was too much to
ask-

12:32.131 --> 12:34.405
To think that we could
take one magnificent trip...

12:34.490 --> 12:36.765
in a tricked-out,
state-of-the-art R.V...

12:36.848 --> 12:38.884
to see the sun
dancing off the Pacific.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.681
What a huge ask!

12:45.365 --> 12:47.832
Ow!

12:52.961 --> 12:55.031
I can't stand the way
everyone's staring at us.

12:55.161 --> 12:58.436
Yeah, I know. It's the way we look at
people who walk with their pet birds.

12:58.519 --> 13:00.033
There she is!

13:00.119 --> 13:02.197
Hey, good luck on your
balance beam routine, sweetie.

13:02.238 --> 13:04.194
- You're gonna do great.
- I'll never beat Lily.

13:04.277 --> 13:06.995
Of course you will,
because you're a superstar.

13:07.074 --> 13:08.668
And your daughter's a genius.
I am such a fan.

13:08.834 --> 13:10.790
Now you're overcompensating.
I have to.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.512
You saw what a monster
I was out there.

13:12.593 --> 13:15.742
This-This is the exact thing
I always hated in my dad-

13:15.830 --> 13:19.505
that ugly, macho,
testosterone drive to win.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.148
And today
it has flowered in me.

13:21.269 --> 13:23.702
Well-
No. This ends today, Cam.

13:23.787 --> 13:25.540
I am not passing this on
to Lily.

13:25.627 --> 13:27.583
It's not all on you. You know,
I'm beginning to think...

13:27.665 --> 13:29.816
maybe I did sabotage
Abby's hair.

13:29.904 --> 13:32.259
I didn't spray.
I didn't Beyoncé.

13:32.344 --> 13:34.175
I basically built
a ticking time bun.

13:34.263 --> 13:35.980
Well-

13:39.660 --> 13:42.298
Are you okay?

13:42.379 --> 13:43.573
No.

13:44.738 --> 13:45.648
Oh!

13:45.777 --> 13:48.769
My hair hurts.
I'll fix it.

13:48.856 --> 13:50.448
Aww!

13:51.615 --> 13:53.128
We should find Lily.

13:53.214 --> 13:56.523
Did you see what
your daughter just did?

13:56.652 --> 13:59.610
Uh, Lily, did you pull the
pins out of Julie's hair?

13:59.690 --> 14:00.966
Yeah. She fell.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.922
Oh.
Okay, um-

14:03.009 --> 14:05.000
I- Could I get everyone's attention
for just a moment?

14:05.089 --> 14:06.840
We consider
what our daughter just did...

14:06.927 --> 14:09.601
to be an embarrassment
to the sport of gymnastics.

14:09.686 --> 14:11.678
I assure you, she
did not learn this from us.

14:11.765 --> 14:14.046
And as far as we are concerned,
that is a sign of weakness.

14:14.085 --> 14:16.440
Not the way a winner
behaves, but the way-

14:16.564 --> 14:18.633
A loser behaves.
...a loser behaves.

14:18.723 --> 14:20.633
Come on, Lily. Let's get
your grips and tiger paws.

14:20.722 --> 14:24.395
You're going to a time-out.
Yeah. A nice long one.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.835
I made pre-team, and my daddies
get to watch from outside.

14:27.959 --> 14:30.159
No closer than 100 feet.
But we're appealing.

14:30.276 --> 14:33.394
Yay! Yay, Lily!

14:34.794 --> 14:37.513
Kill the chicken!
Chicken fingers!

14:37.673 --> 14:40.426
Pigeon man!
Pigeon man. Pigeon man.

14:40.553 --> 14:41.952
You see, Tony, it's not me.

14:42.072 --> 14:44.187
Would you invite her to game night?
I'm gonna go now.

14:44.270 --> 14:47.069
They're kinda sticklers
about the next-day delivery thing.

14:48.069 --> 14:50.184
Bird in the hand!
There you go.

14:50.308 --> 14:52.377
Any slower, she'd be the U.S.
mail. Am I right?

14:52.467 --> 14:54.185
That's gonna kill
at the warehouse.

14:54.266 --> 14:56.575
You see?
You are the problem.

14:56.664 --> 14:58.894
Except you cheated. I saw
you look at the paper.

14:58.983 --> 15:01.703
- I knew it.
- You're no better.

15:01.782 --> 15:03.454
All the screaming and bullying.

15:03.542 --> 15:05.736
The question isn't
why you two weren't invited.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.652
It's why you're ever invited.

15:07.739 --> 15:11.016
And by the way, this
isn't even about you.

15:11.099 --> 15:12.817
Treasure chest.

15:12.897 --> 15:15.014
Now can we clean
this place up and go?

15:18.854 --> 15:20.129
Funny story.

15:20.215 --> 15:22.012
My mom and Jay were invited.

15:22.094 --> 15:25.323
Cam gave me the invitation at
school, and I forgot about it.

15:25.452 --> 15:27.571
But how could I tell them
right after I'd shamed them?

15:27.610 --> 15:29.330
I had to cover my tracks.

15:29.411 --> 15:31.765
It's true, Jay.
I cheated.

15:31.848 --> 15:35.318
I cheat a little bit every time
that we come to the game night.

15:35.408 --> 15:37.159
I think Mitch saw me
the last time,

15:37.246 --> 15:38.965
and that's why they don't
want to play with us anymore.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.764
But why would you do that?
I don't know.

15:41.844 --> 15:45.358
Maybe because I don't want you
to think that I am not smart.

15:45.443 --> 15:46.923
I would never think that.

15:47.002 --> 15:48.880
Besides, it's my fault anyway.

15:48.961 --> 15:51.271
The kid is right.
I'm too competitive.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.873
Lost a game of Yahtzee once.
The dice are still in the wall.

15:53.958 --> 15:55.712
Yeah, but at least
you're not a cheater.

15:55.798 --> 15:58.187
I feel like
such a donkey mouth.

15:58.277 --> 16:01.393
Guys, there's something
you should know.

16:01.475 --> 16:04.195
It's Trivial Pursuit night
at Mom's church.

16:04.275 --> 16:06.266
I hate for you to miss
my poetry reading,

16:06.353 --> 16:07.866
but maybe you could
head down there,

16:07.952 --> 16:09.432
work on your sportsmanship,

16:09.512 --> 16:11.628
and you will feel
better about yourselves.

16:11.710 --> 16:13.940
Are you sure you're going
to be okay without me there?

16:14.030 --> 16:17.227
Yes, Smother. Mother.
I'll be in the car.

16:17.348 --> 16:20.578
I get this damn
competitive streak from my old man.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.585
It's a miracle I didn't
pass it down to Mitchell.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.536
I love that we can blame
our parents.

16:24.624 --> 16:27.616
My mother was the biggest
cheater I've ever known,

16:27.703 --> 16:30.298
and she used to snoop
on everything that we did.

16:30.383 --> 16:33.373
Ay. Jay, look at this.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.099
Our invitation.

16:35.181 --> 16:37.011
They must have forgot
to give it to us.

16:37.099 --> 16:40.135
No. I checked this bag when we
got here, and it wasn't there.

16:40.217 --> 16:43.176
- Why do you always-
- Because you know I have a problem.

16:43.257 --> 16:46.134
This was Manny. He
forgot to give it to us,

16:46.215 --> 16:49.126
and then he came
and tried to sneak it in there.

16:49.213 --> 16:51.682
Why wouldn't he just tell us?

16:51.773 --> 16:54.287
Maybe because he doesn't want
us to go to the reading.

16:54.372 --> 16:58.410
That's why he was talking about
the church and the game.

16:58.490 --> 16:59.923
He was working us.

17:00.009 --> 17:01.768
Guess he's not too much
of a Goody Two-shoes.

17:01.847 --> 17:07.046
No. He's a lying,
scheming little sneak.

17:07.125 --> 17:08.558
That's my son.

17:08.644 --> 17:09.680
Our son.

17:11.243 --> 17:13.359
I've never seen Dad
freak out like that before.

17:13.443 --> 17:14.922
I feel terrible.

17:15.002 --> 17:16.482
Oh, it's partly my fault.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.076
I goaded you guys into a
fight to prove a point.

17:19.159 --> 17:20.913
Why do I always have to win?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.990
How did I get this way?

17:25.156 --> 17:26.715
That you?

17:26.836 --> 17:28.269
Yeah.

17:28.435 --> 17:30.028
You?
Yep.

17:30.154 --> 17:33.066
How many kids in yours?
Felt like 30.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.745
I got four.

17:34.832 --> 17:37.426
But I'm thinking of emancipating
two of them early.

17:37.512 --> 17:39.742
Tell me one of you
has cigarettes or a flask.

17:39.830 --> 17:41.025
Sorry, buddy.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.384
I've
been through every state-

17:43.469 --> 17:46.585
depressed, catatonic, Arkansas.

17:46.668 --> 17:50.262
I considered faking my own death
in Bryce Canyon National Park.

17:50.345 --> 17:52.575
Have you been?
Not to be missed.

17:52.665 --> 17:55.053
I'm gonna miss it. I'm
missing every bit of it.

17:55.143 --> 17:58.101
Not spending another second
in that rolling asylum.

17:58.183 --> 18:02.095
Poor guy. How long you been on the road?
Couple weeks?

18:02.181 --> 18:04.011
Couple days?

18:06.818 --> 18:09.889
Dad's in the middle
of a super-sad dude hug.

18:09.977 --> 18:12.535
We really disappointed him.

18:12.615 --> 18:15.926
Yeah, maybe we should just suck it
up and go to Jellystone this summer.

18:16.015 --> 18:18.447
Wait. That's why Dad
got this thing?

18:18.532 --> 18:20.762
I-I can't go on a trip
this summer.

18:20.851 --> 18:23.241
- Why?
- I've...

18:23.330 --> 18:27.209
I've got stuff.
Huh? No. What stuff?

18:27.328 --> 18:29.286
I don't want to talk about it.
Luke.

18:29.367 --> 18:32.200
Summer school.
I'm failing pre-algebra.

18:32.326 --> 18:35.955
Why didn't you say something? I don't know.
I feel stupid.

18:36.044 --> 18:37.524
You know what it's like
to follow her?

18:37.564 --> 18:39.396
All the teachers look at me...

18:39.484 --> 18:42.156
and think that I'm some kind
of irrational remainder.

18:42.243 --> 18:44.437
- Did I use that right?
- No.

18:44.561 --> 18:46.040
Dang it.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.240
Why didn't you ask me?
I would've tutored you.

18:48.279 --> 18:51.395
I tried, but you were
always off in your room...

18:51.478 --> 18:53.276
or some corner of the house
on the phone.

18:53.398 --> 18:56.115
Yeah, who have you been talking
to so much lately? Aaron?

18:56.275 --> 18:58.391
Who's Aaron? Actually, it's
two boys-Aaron and Alex.

18:58.514 --> 19:00.551
Oh, two boys. A boy
named Alex likes you?

19:00.634 --> 19:02.908
Yeah, I know. It's weird. But
my friend Andi with an "I"-

19:03.032 --> 19:05.262
she's a girl-also liked Alex.
The boy?

19:05.351 --> 19:07.387
Yes, the boy. I don't refer to
myself in the third person.

19:07.471 --> 19:09.701
I thought Aaron was
the third person. No.

19:09.789 --> 19:12.258
Anyway, I thought I was cool
juggling two boys at once, but-

19:12.348 --> 19:14.863
they both ended up
dumping me on the same day.

19:14.948 --> 19:16.506
Sweetie, that's awful.

19:16.586 --> 19:18.497
How did I not know
this was happening?

19:18.585 --> 19:20.338
You've been really busy lately.

19:20.425 --> 19:22.255
Like with flipping that house.

19:22.343 --> 19:24.184
And plus I didn't really
want to talk about it,

19:24.262 --> 19:26.696
because it's kind of embarrassing.
Oh.

19:26.781 --> 19:29.932
Not as embarrassing as failing a
class that starts with "pre."

19:30.020 --> 19:32.091
Baby.
You guys wanna feel better?

19:32.180 --> 19:34.899
I auditioned to be
a Laker Girl this morning.

19:35.018 --> 19:36.532
What? You did? No way.

19:36.618 --> 19:39.529
I took all those dance classes when
I was younger, and I don't know.

19:39.616 --> 19:42.334
I've been trying to figure out
what I want to do with my life.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.849
So I saw online that
there were open tryouts,

19:44.934 --> 19:46.446
so I went down there.
And?

19:46.532 --> 19:48.762
I'm the new
head Laker Girl, Mom.

19:48.852 --> 19:51.570
It was a disaster.
I was the worst one there.

19:51.651 --> 19:53.527
I couldn't even
get through my routine.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.440
Oh.
You have a routine?

19:56.689 --> 19:58.883
Pat, Heath,
you guys have given me...

19:58.968 --> 20:00.447
the courage to go back
in there,

20:00.526 --> 20:03.199
stand up to my wife and tell
her she was right all along.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.196
Happy trails, Phil.

20:05.284 --> 20:06.479
Heath?

20:06.604 --> 20:08.913
I might just stay here a while.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.642
Phil? Phil, I have to
show you something.

20:12.681 --> 20:15.639
Don't gloat. I get it. I keep trying
to push this family closer together,

20:15.759 --> 20:18.199
but they need their space. No, no, no.
We have too much space.

20:18.278 --> 20:21.314
Being trapped in one room has forced
us to actually talk to one another,

20:21.397 --> 20:23.715
and I have found out some
incredible things about our kids.

20:23.755 --> 20:25.871
Wait. Incredible good?

20:25.955 --> 20:27.787
You tell me.

20:29.834 --> 20:31.586
Oh, my God.

20:31.673 --> 20:34.630
- Dream come true. I don't even need context.
- Yeah!

20:34.710 --> 20:36.383
What is this?

20:36.510 --> 20:39.421
So our trip's back on?
We're in if Jolene's in.

20:39.548 --> 20:42.346
Come on. Do it!
Yeah!

20:47.106 --> 20:48.585
Oh! Why can't I get this?

20:48.665 --> 20:50.895
You just gotta focus.
Clear your mind.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.735
Loosen up. Get in the zone.
You know this.

20:52.823 --> 20:55.103
Okay, we're gonna walk through
this together, step-by-step.

20:55.142 --> 20:57.450
Five, six, seven, eight.

20:57.540 --> 21:00.259
One, two, three, four,

21:00.340 --> 21:03.057
five and six, seven and eight.
56.1 plus or minus 8.25.

21:03.217 --> 21:04.970
That's the first one.
One, two, three, four, five, six-

21:05.057 --> 21:06.854
Number two. "X" plus two over
four equals three plus three-

21:06.937 --> 21:10.166
Two, five minus-
Damn it, Alex, do you mind?

21:10.254 --> 21:12.973
We're doing something
important here.

21:13.053 --> 21:16.249
Okay, once more from the tippy,
like nobody's watching.

21:16.332 --> 21:18.130
The quantity of "X" plus two,
uh, plus six.

21:18.211 --> 21:20.407
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two-
