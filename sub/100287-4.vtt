Damn, where's...

00:13.360 --> 00:15.420
[sigh]

00:15.520 --> 00:17.520
Shit.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.380
[clattering]

00:22.480 --> 00:24.560
-Oh, Ivy...
-What's that?

00:25.560 --> 00:28.440
It's just... Oh, shit! Shit!

00:31.520 --> 00:32.900
Is that the Indian?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.660
From the other night?

00:34.760 --> 00:36.540
No. No, we finished all that.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.640
-Did we?

00:39.320 --> 00:42.080
'Cause I'm pretty sure there was
enough for me to take to lunch.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.900
Unless that's what you're doing
and you just don't want to admit it.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Don't be ridiculous. This...

00:49.840 --> 00:52.180
This is coffee. I'm taking it to work.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.740
To drink.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.840
At work.

01:04.360 --> 01:08.520

01:18.920 --> 01:21.100

[door knob clinks]
-[Lloyd] Eadie? You in there?

01:24.160 --> 01:25.620
Yeah, just a minute.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.420
-[Lloyd] Ah. How come it's locked?

01:28.520 --> 01:30.300
I'll just be two minutes.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.400
-[Lloyd] OK.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.080
[pills rattle]

02:05.400 --> 02:07.400
Shit.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.640
[mysterious, erratic
orchestral music]

02:34.520 --> 02:37.880
The eggs had a bit of a fall
but I applied the three-second rule.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.400
So, you, Lloyd Green,
are going to eat, get dressed...

02:42.480 --> 02:44.660
get back into the lab
and sort out your problem.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.580
Is that what I'm gonna do?

02:46.680 --> 02:48.680
Well, what's the alternative?

02:49.840 --> 02:52.940
[sighs] For ten years
I've woken up every day

02:53.040 --> 02:55.480
and I've known exactly what it is
that I'm meant to do.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.540
I don't know, maybe I'm not the guy,
maybe I'm not the one to solve it.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.940
Maybe I just...

03:02.040 --> 03:04.040
need to give it up.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.060
Postal work.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.500
Ordered, meditative. I can see you there.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.100
Little hat. Scanner that goes beep.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.740
-[electronic voice] Lloyd,
meeting request, with Lindriquil eight a.m.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.060
- Who's Lindriquil? Is that a person?
Sounds like a kid from drama class.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.580
It's a private company. Big!

03:21.680 --> 03:23.340
Maybe they want to headhunt you.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.260
Yes, because of my extraordinary success,
Ivy.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.220
Ah! Ow!

03:28.320 --> 03:30.400
You'll solve this thing.
You know you will.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.540
It's not public news yet
that you crashed and burned.

03:34.640 --> 03:35.980
Had a setback.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.860
No, it's not public yet.

03:37.960 --> 03:42.020
So, then, go negotiate a big fat deal
before everyone finds out.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.300
That's my daughter. There she is.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.400
That's me! Gotta go. See ya.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.080
-You OK?
-Yeah.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.760
Bit flat, that's all.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.800
No biggie.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.020
-[Lloyd] I appreciate the offer,
I really do. But we are not ready.

04:20.120 --> 04:23.220
We have some troubles
that we need to iron out.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.900
-You want to keep control of the data,
that's fine.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.300
It's more than that I'm afraid. It's uh...

04:28.400 --> 04:30.020
There are some issues
that we need to resolve

04:30.120 --> 04:32.820
before we can move forward with anyone.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.900
I uh... I thought Herman might have told
you that just to save you the trouble.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.020
-He did. That's why we want to
get behind the project now.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.180
Help you push on,
not let the project collapse.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.280
I mean, after all your hard work...

04:46.840 --> 04:48.580
You'll also need to partner up
with a vax team.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.940
And we have a delivery team here
ready to go.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.400
Perfect for a public-private partnership.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.640
We have an immunology team at the NIS,
so...

05:07.280 --> 05:10.060
You think we're some evil corporation
come to corrupt you?

05:10.160 --> 05:12.100
I didn't say that.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.140
I'm not gonna pretend
I'm not interested in

05:14.240 --> 05:16.440
the full commercialisation
of your work, Lloyd.

05:17.960 --> 05:21.140
I just see it as a chance
to harness that drive,

05:21.240 --> 05:24.020
get the process right and get it
out to the people who need it most.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.180
And... I'm not sure who loses there.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.780
I appreciate that. I do.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.300
But, uh... this is not
my decision to make alone.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.860
This work is co-authored.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.540
I hear you're the brains of the outfit.

05:36.640 --> 05:41.660
Well, Lloyd's really the only one
who can take it beyond the theoretical.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.980
You know that's true.

05:44.080 --> 05:48.440
Lloyd... you know the kind of resources
we have.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.280
I appreciate it. I do. Uh...

05:57.560 --> 05:59.560
But I think we're good.

06:01.440 --> 06:05.520
[solemn atmospheric music]

06:14.360 --> 06:16.360
[crowd murmuring]

06:19.640 --> 06:22.400
-[Abel] Emergency Services
were overrun the night of the storm.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.640
A tonne of the calls were redirected
to the automated system.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.400
One of the calls they tracked back
was from Rachel's kid.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.360
She said she wanted you here
when she heard it.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.840
I just think she's withdrawing too hard.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.560
[beep]

06:45.800 --> 06:52.280
-[Louisa]<i> I, um... I don't know what</i>

06:54.560 --> 06:58.540

07:25.800 --> 07:29.380
Rachel, this is good news.
It means she's still alive.

07:29.480 --> 07:33.240
But... I'm sorry, I just don't...

07:35.400 --> 07:37.400
That's my daughter?

07:42.080 --> 07:44.080
How can I not know something like that?

07:45.800 --> 07:47.900
[bugs chittering]

07:48.000 --> 07:50.540
-[Shay] My thinking overnight,

07:50.640 --> 07:52.940
we get Herm to allocate us
some data crunchers.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.540
We run the numbers again,

07:54.640 --> 07:58.700
try and definitively isolate where
the off-target mutation points are

07:58.800 --> 08:00.460
and we double down there.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.660
No?

08:01.760 --> 08:03.220
-[Lloyd] You're bandaiding it.

08:03.320 --> 08:06.140
Um, yeah, I'm trying to stop the bleed
long enough

08:06.240 --> 08:08.060
for us to figure out a workaround.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.060
-There is no workaround.
-Really?

08:10.160 --> 08:12.300
-When did you run the data on that?
-I didn't need to.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.400
I'm telling you I already know, OK.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.620
Well, I'll just sit here quietly
until you work out

08:19.720 --> 08:21.740
where I can humbly put my efforts...

08:21.840 --> 08:23.840
-That's not what I'm saying, Shay.
-No worries.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.440
[door clicks]

08:28.440 --> 08:31.540
I suspect this decision is one worth
taking a long, hard second look at.

08:31.640 --> 08:32.620
What decision?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.140
You know, Herman, if you had told me

08:35.240 --> 08:38.020
that you were organising meetings already,
I might have been...

08:38.120 --> 08:39.780
What meetings? You two.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.140
She'll give you until close of business
for a change of heart.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.940
[phone chimes]
-[Herman] Yep?

08:45.040 --> 08:47.640
OK, be up in a sec.
[door clicks]

08:48.680 --> 08:50.800
-[Lloyd] It'd be a disaster.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.300
That will bury every problem
in the race to bring out a vaccine.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.740
We could do our own quality control.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.980
Mate, we'd be gone.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.020
They'll rush out a vaccine,
make it stupid expensive,

09:02.120 --> 09:04.180
which is great for the shareholders.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.280
Not so good for the people
who actually need it.

09:09.720 --> 09:13.420
Are you saying this whole
corporate greed thing is real?

09:13.520 --> 09:15.520
Herm's pimping himself out.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.360
He's already bought the penthouse.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.380
He'll be pissed if we say no.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.480
I've already shut it down.

09:27.560 --> 09:29.560
OK.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.620
I'm gonna assume that
you stepped out of that meeting

09:32.720 --> 09:35.540
and made some frantic phone calls to me

09:35.640 --> 09:38.480
to get my two cents
before making this decision on our behalf.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.220
You want to get in bed with Lindriquil?

09:41.320 --> 09:43.320
No, I don't.

09:44.240 --> 09:48.860
I just wouldn't mind being asked
occasionally so I'm not, you know...

09:48.960 --> 09:51.100
[rustling]

09:51.200 --> 09:53.200
...actually the sherpa.

09:56.840 --> 10:00.300

10:09.920 --> 10:12.400

10:15.480 --> 10:16.940
We'll come get you now.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.260
-[Eadie] Rachel.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.560
We were gonna pick up Gianni's mum.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.020
From the nursing home in town.

10:23.120 --> 10:26.740
We were gonna get her and then wait out
the storm at the show... grounds.

10:26.840 --> 10:30.480
You got into trouble between your house
and the nursing home, yes?

10:31.480 --> 10:33.540
OK, well, let me put a call in
to the Emergency Services.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.540
At least it will help bring down
the search area.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.860
To 100 miles of bush instead of 200.
I can't just sit here.

10:38.960 --> 10:42.260
You are in no fit state to travel.
How would you even get there?

10:42.360 --> 10:44.780
I'll steal a car. I'll hitch...

10:44.880 --> 10:46.860
Uhhh! [groans]

10:46.960 --> 10:48.460
Sit back down. Take a deep breath.

10:48.560 --> 10:51.540
Oh, god, I can't do this. I can't...

10:51.640 --> 10:53.580
-Take some breaths.
-I can't do it.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.440
It's OK. It's OK. It's gonna be OK.

11:54.160 --> 11:56.100
Smack bang in the middle
of the disaster zone.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.040
I know some of the crew
who are running operations out there.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.060
I could get in touch with them, you know,

12:02.160 --> 12:04.300
see if they've got an update on
your little girl and her father.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.740
That would be great.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.800
But I was hoping for something
a bit more hands-on.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.340
It's what you do, isn't it?

12:12.440 --> 12:15.180
Find damsels in distress,
bring them home safe?

12:15.280 --> 12:17.180
There'll be a ground crew out there
searching already.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.660
They're overstretched, you know that.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.820

There's still a chance.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.820
I'm not going and neither are you.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.260
What, so we just give up on them?

12:38.360 --> 12:40.360
With those odds.

You've no idea what it's like out there,
Ead.

I think I can handle it.

you'd be out there in a heartbeat.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.160
[thunder rumbling loudly]

30:35.520 --> 30:37.460
[tense music]

30:37.560 --> 30:39.720
We only got halfway to Gianni's mum's.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.420
We turned back for home.

30:43.520 --> 30:45.520
[thunder rumbling, wind rattling]

30:47.960 --> 30:49.900
We turned around to go back home...

30:50.000 --> 30:51.580
[thunderclap]

30:51.680 --> 30:52.980
..to get the Fentanyl.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.140
[slams glovebox shut]
Oh, shit.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.580
No, just forget it, OK. I'll be fine.

30:57.680 --> 31:00.760
No, OK. Now is not the time to detox.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.360
Then what happened?

31:11.040 --> 31:13.820
We took a shortcut along the river.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.380
What could you see?

31:15.480 --> 31:17.480
We pass a tree...

31:19.600 --> 31:21.920
split by lightning.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.480
[thunder rumbles]

31:33.320 --> 31:35.620
It's OK. It's OK, baby.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.720
It's OK.

31:40.040 --> 31:42.080
[thunderclap]

31:45.200 --> 31:47.200
[thunder rumbles]

31:50.560 --> 31:52.600
We took a left down Creek Road.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.780
We took a left down Creek Road.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.880
We run off the road.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.880
Ok, Ok. It's coming up.
Creek Road, Creek Road.

32:14.680 --> 32:17.560
No... Yeah, this is it.
This is it! Stop, stop!

32:23.520 --> 32:25.520
-Eadie wait!
-Rachel wait, wait!

32:31.720 --> 32:34.140
No, no, no, no...

32:34.240 --> 32:36.060
No, no, no.

32:36.160 --> 32:38.560
No! No! No! [whimpers]

32:42.480 --> 32:45.720
[hysterical whimpering]

32:58.240 --> 33:00.680
I'm so... I'm so...

33:04.000 --> 33:07.080
[Rachel whimpers, cries]

33:15.680 --> 33:17.660
[Rachel whimpers]

33:17.760 --> 33:21.880
[sombre orchestral music]

33:29.520 --> 33:33.240
[indistinct radio chatter]

33:36.080 --> 33:40.160
[sombre orchestral music]

33:56.120 --> 33:59.200
[sombre music continues]

34:10.680 --> 34:12.680
[beeping]

34:19.080 --> 34:21.080
Supposed to have my injection.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.600
Do you want me to pull over?

34:25.280 --> 34:27.300
-No.
-It's fine. I can just pull over here.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.380
-You don't have to.
-I don't want you to miss and stab me...

34:29.480 --> 34:31.480
I said don't pull over, Dom!

34:37.880 --> 34:40.880
I'm sorry. What the hell am I doing?
I don't know what I'm doing.

34:43.440 --> 34:44.900
Maybe it's too late.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.660
What do you mean "It's too late"?

34:46.760 --> 34:48.180
I don't know, too late for this.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.600
Too... Too late for everything. Maybe...

34:51.600 --> 34:54.660
All my looking on the bright side
and seeing the good,

34:54.760 --> 34:56.260
maybe I'm just dreaming and...

34:56.360 --> 35:00.400
It's not gonna get better. It's just gonna
get more and more like that. And...

35:01.960 --> 35:04.380
I'm struggling to remember why
I thought having a baby,

35:04.480 --> 35:06.600
when it's like this, was a good idea.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.160
Hey.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.280
Come on, let's get you home.

35:28.080 --> 35:30.080
[sombre music]

35:57.640 --> 36:02.960
[sombre music continues]

36:17.680 --> 36:19.680
Do you need anything?

36:22.680 --> 36:24.460
[quietly] I'll get you a water.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.560
[Eadie] Lloyd...

36:42.280 --> 36:44.280
[sombre music]

36:45.880 --> 36:47.880
Did you have any luck?

36:48.680 --> 36:50.060
With the bugs?

36:50.160 --> 36:52.160
No.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.180
But I'm back there trying.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.280
Thanks to you.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.680
What else can you do?

37:02.320 --> 37:04.320
[sombre music]

37:18.280 --> 37:20.280
[sombre music continues]

37:33.640 --> 37:40.640
[muffled helicopter whirring]

37:55.680 --> 37:57.680
Out you get.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.320
Is this is ours?

38:02.680 --> 38:04.460
-[Francesca] Not too far, girls!
-[girl] How cool is this?

38:04.560 --> 38:07.340
-[Dom] It's a bit rough around the edges,
I know, but it's all here.

38:07.440 --> 38:10.180
Six K solar set-up, battery backup,

38:10.280 --> 38:13.140
inverter, diesel generator -
everything we need.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.340
Even got a nice, cool breeze
coming up the valley.

38:15.440 --> 38:18.660
-[Francesca] You bought this? Seriously?
Without even a word?

38:18.760 --> 38:21.560
Well, we talked about finding
a bolthole in the bush.

38:22.560 --> 38:25.220
Look, the opportunity came up
and I just had to jump on it.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.320
Come on, there's something
I want to show you.

38:31.800 --> 38:37.760
[tense music]

38:41.880 --> 38:44.520
Spring fed - never gonna run dry.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.140
[slurps]

38:48.240 --> 38:50.920
Oh! It's beautiful. Check it out.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.400
Trust me, you'll never taste
anything like it.

38:58.480 --> 38:59.660
Go on, Arch.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.420
Don't force him if he doesn't want to.

39:01.520 --> 39:06.420
Cryptosporidium, giardia,
microplastics,

39:06.520 --> 39:09.380
glyphosates and faecal matter.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.980
Faecal matter...
This is national park catchment.

39:12.080 --> 39:16.660
Sandstone filtered, pure, unadulterated,
pollution-free, Arch.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.060
Trust me, I promise you.

39:18.160 --> 39:21.380
-[Cosmo] No such thing.
Nowhere in the world.

39:21.480 --> 39:24.460
-Dom...
-Come on, buddy, trust me. Drink.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.300
-Dom, you're being a dick.
-Drink.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.940
Put the water down, honey.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.060
For Christ's sake, you don't understand.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.740
-This spring is gonna save us.
-From what, exactly?

39:32.840 --> 39:35.140
-[Cosmo] Yeah, Dad,
what's it gonna save us from?

39:35.240 --> 39:37.240
Fine, forget it. Don't drink.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.460
One more. One more.

39:45.560 --> 39:47.180
There we go. There we go.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.580
See?

39:48.680 --> 39:50.760
Have you considered the merits of
a succulent garden?

39:52.360 --> 39:55.160
There's no challenge in that, OK?

39:59.480 --> 40:01.480
[sombre music]

40:15.680 --> 40:17.760
[sombre music continues]

40:28.680 --> 40:30.680
[gunshot]

40:32.080 --> 40:37.100
[gunshots]

40:37.200 --> 40:42.220
[gunshots]

40:42.320 --> 40:44.400
[sombre music]

41:11.320 --> 41:13.400
[sombre music continues]

41:19.120 --> 41:23.420

41:23.520 --> 41:27.620
[gunshots]

41:27.720 --> 41:34.640
[sombre orchestral music builds]

41:37.560 --> 41:39.560
[gunshot]

41:51.520 --> 41:54.520
[tense music]
