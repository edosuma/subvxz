WEBVTT

00:03.041 --> 00:04.417
Well, Charlie,

00:04.500 --> 00:05.542
as you can see

00:05.625 --> 00:08.041
we are all still living
in this hotel room.

00:08.125 --> 00:10.625
And we are here because someone

00:10.709 --> 00:12.041
let termites eat our house.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.041
It was not my fault.

00:15.125 --> 00:16.709
Oh, of course not, Dad.

00:19.709 --> 00:22.250
Totally his fault.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.125
Anyway, it's a little crowded

00:24.208 --> 00:26.500
with everyone here, but we're doing okay.

00:26.583 --> 00:28.000
Would you keep it down over there?

00:30.583 --> 00:31.625
Just okay.

00:31.709 --> 00:33.583
Just barely okay.

00:35.583 --> 00:36.917
Gabe, what is your problem?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.333
I am on the phone.

00:38.417 --> 00:39.333
With who?

00:39.417 --> 00:41.000
No one. It's just a friend.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.083
I’ll have the rib-eye steak,

00:43.166 --> 00:44.792
medium-rare.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.458
Gabe, I told you.

00:46.542 --> 00:47.667
No room service.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.250
Mom, I’m hungry.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.875
Well, then have a peanut butter sandwich.

00:50.959 --> 00:52.166
I’m sick of those.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.500
Me too.

00:54.250 --> 00:55.250
Look.

00:55.333 --> 00:57.542
We're meeting with the contractor
later on today,

00:57.625 --> 00:59.667
but until we find out
how much we need to spend

00:59.750 --> 01:00.792
to fix the house,

01:00.875 --> 01:02.792
we are in money-saving mode.

01:02.875 --> 01:04.083
Yeah, that sounds fair.

01:04.166 --> 01:07.625
You destroy the house,
and we don't get to eat.

01:08.625 --> 01:10.208
It was not my fault!

01:10.291 --> 01:11.875
All: Right.

01:11.959 --> 01:14.667
I can't believe I went
from having my own room

01:14.750 --> 01:16.041
to being stuck here with you people.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.458
Aww.

01:17.542 --> 01:21.375
Poor baby doesn't have
his own room anymore.

01:21.458 --> 01:22.542
Too bad.

01:22.625 --> 01:23.875
Aw.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.375
It's too bad you don't
have a boyfriend anymore.

01:26.458 --> 01:27.542
Gabe.

01:27.625 --> 01:29.208
No, Mom. It's okay.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.000
We're all a little stressed out.

01:31.083 --> 01:32.625
Gabe's dealing with it his way.

01:32.709 --> 01:35.709
Now I’m gonna deal with it my way.

01:35.792 --> 01:38.333

Uh, how we looking, Kevin?

02:41.542 --> 02:43.458
Hey, before we talk about the house,

02:43.542 --> 02:45.208
I want to give you these.

02:45.709 --> 02:47.667
One free pass to the giggle hut.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.125
Oh, you're a stand-up comedian too?

02:50.208 --> 02:52.792
Teah, everyone's always
telling me how funny I am.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.792
My niche is construction-related humor.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.709
Is that a popular niche?

03:00.792 --> 03:01.792
You tell me.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.792
Did you hear about the singing plumber?

03:06.875 --> 03:08.792
He had great pipes.

03:10.667 --> 03:13.166
Because singer's sometimes
refer to their voices as--

03:13.250 --> 03:15.750
- Pipes.
- Yeah, no. We got that.

03:16.959 --> 03:18.583
So, about the house?

03:18.667 --> 03:20.291
Okay.

03:20.375 --> 03:22.667
Well, the first problem...

03:22.750 --> 03:24.667
That's the sky up there,

03:24.750 --> 03:27.375
and you're not supposed
to be able to see it from here.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.583
Is that a comedy observation

03:31.667 --> 03:33.250
or a construction observation?

03:33.333 --> 03:35.458
Construction. Unless it was funny.

03:35.542 --> 03:37.417
I mean, was it? I can never tell.

03:40.542 --> 03:42.125
So I guess you're looking at two options.

03:42.208 --> 03:43.625
Rebuild the house the way it was,

03:43.709 --> 03:45.250
or given the amount of damage here,

03:45.375 --> 03:47.083
you could tear it down
and build a brand new one.

03:47.166 --> 03:48.333
A dream house if you will.

03:48.417 --> 03:50.125
A dream house?

03:50.208 --> 03:51.834
- That sounds interesting.
- That sure does.

03:51.917 --> 03:53.625
You could have anything
your heart desires.

03:53.709 --> 03:56.542
Bob, I can finally get the dining room
I've always wanted.

03:57.041 --> 03:58.709
I could get my own bathroom

03:58.792 --> 04:00.375
with one of those Japanese toilets.

04:00.458 --> 04:02.208
You know, the ones
with the silent flushing system

04:02.291 --> 04:03.917
and the temperature-controlled
heated seat.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.917
We all have different dreams.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.291
Emmett, great news.

04:13.375 --> 04:15.667
You know how we've been talking
about moving to a bigger apartment

04:15.750 --> 04:18.792
before things get really bad
and we start hating each other forever?

04:18.875 --> 04:20.500
We've never talked about that.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.500
Oh, right.

04:22.875 --> 04:24.917
Remind me, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.083
Anyway, I just found out
about this apartment.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.083
Check this out.

04:29.166 --> 04:31.000
- Oh, this is great.
- Right?

04:31.083 --> 04:33.667
- It has two bedrooms.
- That's two more than we have now.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.375
We've got to get this apartment.

04:35.458 --> 04:37.166
Okay. There's one little problem.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.917
We have this thing called a lease.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.500
The thing Bernie the
landlord made us sign?

04:41.583 --> 04:43.583
It says we have to live here
for at least a year.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.375
It also says that we have to keep it clean

04:45.458 --> 04:46.792
and pay our rent on time.

04:47.792 --> 04:48.959
Well, let's read it.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.583
Maybe there's some way
we can get out of it.

04:50.667 --> 04:51.875
Okay. I keep it over here

04:52.000 --> 04:53.834
with the rest of our important documents.

04:53.917 --> 04:55.750
Okay, Indian.

04:55.834 --> 04:57.625
Chinese. Thai.

04:57.709 --> 04:58.709
Lease. Here we go.

05:01.709 --> 05:03.417
Oh, here it is.

05:03.875 --> 05:06.250
"This lease may not be broken
under penalty of law."

05:06.500 --> 05:08.125
Never should have signed this thing.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.625
Yeah, but you did.

05:10.083 --> 05:11.625
With a smiley face.

05:11.709 --> 05:14.625
Well, I think the signature
should express an emotion.

05:14.709 --> 05:16.041
Mmm.

05:16.125 --> 05:18.709
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hang on.

05:18.792 --> 05:20.083
We can't leave,

05:20.166 --> 05:21.500
but we can get kicked out.

05:21.583 --> 05:22.709
Well, how do we do that?

05:22.792 --> 05:24.291
"Landlord may evict tenant from premises

05:24.375 --> 05:26.500
if "a" the tenant brings
a pet on the premises,

05:26.583 --> 05:28.125
- Or "b"--
- Who cares about "b"?

05:28.208 --> 05:29.125
"A" is perfect.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.000
Your family have any pets we can borrow?

05:31.083 --> 05:32.834
No. We just have babies.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.500
We can dress one of them up like a pet.

05:36.583 --> 05:39.041
I promised I wouldn't do that anymore.

05:43.166 --> 05:46.667
Okay. Here is a rough sketch I made
of the new house.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.458
I think everybody
is going to be very happy.

05:49.542 --> 05:51.750
Now Gabe, you get your bedroom
above the garage.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.458
- Oh, yes.
- And teddy

05:53.542 --> 05:55.083
gets a mountain view.

05:55.166 --> 05:56.375
Yes!

05:56.458 --> 05:58.583
Oh, I’m finally out of the basement.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.959
Hey wait, what's happening to my old room?

06:01.041 --> 06:02.041
Oh!

06:02.125 --> 06:04.834
That becomes daddy's man cave.

06:04.917 --> 06:06.917
Or mommy's yoga room.

06:10.125 --> 06:11.667
You know what? Well call it a--

06:11.750 --> 06:12.834
A multi-purpose room.

06:12.917 --> 06:13.834
It can have a lot of uses.

06:13.917 --> 06:15.750
Okay. We'll talk about it later.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.750
Honey, when you say,

06:17.834 --> 06:19.542
"We'll talk about it later," I never win.

06:19.625 --> 06:21.250
Well, would you like to talk about it now?

06:21.375 --> 06:24.583
Hey, now is not
usually good for you.

06:25.875 --> 06:28.500
Bob, honey, I am not unreasonable, okay?

06:28.583 --> 06:31.000
You want a man cave, I want a yoga room.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.417
We'll just compromise,

06:32.500 --> 06:34.709
call it a... Yoga room.

06:36.709 --> 06:38.083
Told ya.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.667
Charlie, you excited about your new house?

06:44.166 --> 06:45.375
What do you think, Circle?

06:47.792 --> 06:49.375
We don't want a new house.

06:50.709 --> 06:51.709
Of course you do.

06:51.792 --> 06:53.583
Circle said, "no."

06:56.291 --> 06:57.750
Charlie, dolls can't talk.

06:57.834 --> 06:58.959
Hey.

06:59.041 --> 07:00.458
Gabe, don't say that.

07:00.542 --> 07:01.834
When I was Charlie's age,

07:01.917 --> 07:03.834
I used to talk to my dolls too.

07:03.917 --> 07:05.542
I think it's adorable.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.667
Yeah well, I think it's disturbing.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.834
Circle doesn't like you.

07:12.125 --> 07:13.458
Yeah well, listen up, blue boy,

07:13.542 --> 07:14.750
I don't like you either.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.709
Who's talking to dolls now?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.500
Hi. Derek Newly.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.000
Ed Johnson.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.792
Why does it say "Ted Johnson"?

07:44.667 --> 07:46.583
Oh, because...

07:46.667 --> 07:47.917
The "T" is silent.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.083
That's how we do it in allahassee.

07:53.792 --> 07:55.709
You look awfully young
to be an accountant.

07:56.166 --> 07:57.166
I get that a lot.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.500
If you don't mind me asking,
how old are you?

07:59.583 --> 08:01.000
I’m 14.

08:01.083 --> 08:03.375
You know, I don't like to brag,

08:03.458 --> 08:05.083
but I’m kind of a genius.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.083
Graduated high school at nine,

08:07.166 --> 08:09.458
college at 11,
and went straight into accounting.

08:09.542 --> 08:11.667
Oh, that's odd.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.792
It's just that most people
who are geniuses

08:13.875 --> 08:14.875
don't go into Accounting.

08:14.959 --> 08:17.041
I was 11. What did I know?

08:24.750 --> 08:25.750
What is that?

08:25.834 --> 08:27.625
I went out and got us a pet.

08:27.709 --> 08:29.250
I think he's a myna bird.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.250
Well, I don't myna what he is

08:31.333 --> 08:32.792
as long as he gets us thrown out of here.

08:34.333 --> 08:35.917
Yeah, let the bird do the talking.

08:36.625 --> 08:37.834
It talks?

08:37.917 --> 08:40.333
I taught it a few things
before you got home.

08:40.417 --> 08:43.000
Wait till Bernie the landlord hears this.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.959
Okay, bird. Go ahead. Say it.

08:45.041 --> 08:47.834
Bernie's a dope. Bernie's a dope.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.583
I love it.

08:50.667 --> 08:51.875
Landlord.

08:53.709 --> 08:55.625
No, no, no, no. No, no.

08:55.709 --> 08:57.125
No.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.500
You taught it to fly?

09:00.583 --> 09:02.625
It came with that skill.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.583
Well maybe you should have
closed the window.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.458
I have to be in charge of everything?

09:07.792 --> 09:09.166
- Landlord.
- Answer the door.

09:13.750 --> 09:14.667
You wanted to see me?

09:14.750 --> 09:16.250
Hey, Bernie.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.458
Just wanted to let you know,

09:18.542 --> 09:19.667
we got a pet bird.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.083
I don't see a bird.

09:21.166 --> 09:22.875
I see a perch.

09:24.083 --> 09:25.375
That's where the bird was.

09:25.458 --> 09:27.041
He's not there now.

09:28.125 --> 09:30.667
He stepped out for a bit.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.125
He'll be right back.

09:34.125 --> 09:34.959
Well.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.041
When he gets here,

09:37.125 --> 09:38.333
give me a holler.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.083
Hey, Charlie.

09:49.166 --> 09:51.166
You're gonna love the new house.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.417
No.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.625
Charlie.

09:54.709 --> 09:56.000
Hey.

09:56.083 --> 09:58.709
It's gonna be right here
where our old house is.

09:58.792 --> 10:00.709
Just new and better.

10:01.709 --> 10:03.625
Okay, I’m gonna get some more boxes.

10:03.709 --> 10:05.500
I will be right back.

10:07.792 --> 10:08.917
Charlie.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.542
We need to talk.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.166
Okay.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.709
But Gabe said you can't talk.

10:17.792 --> 10:19.709
Then what am I doing right now?

10:19.792 --> 10:21.208
Good point.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.083
Of course Gabe thinks I can't talk.

10:24.417 --> 10:26.083
Wish he couldn't talk.

10:26.458 --> 10:31.166
- What do you want?
- Charlie, you gotta save this house.

10:31.250 --> 10:32.542
What can I do?

10:32.625 --> 10:35.000
Do what little kids do.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.875
Make a mess.

10:36.959 --> 10:38.125
Okay.

10:42.458 --> 10:44.625
There you go. Good job.

10:50.667 --> 10:51.834
Charlie.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.291
Hey.

10:53.625 --> 10:54.917
What are you doing?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.458
We don't want to go.

10:56.542 --> 10:57.542
We?

10:57.625 --> 10:59.834
Me and Circle like this house.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.333
Oh, Charlie.

11:02.542 --> 11:06.125
Hey. What is going on in here?

11:06.208 --> 11:08.208
Charlie doesn't want a new house.

11:08.291 --> 11:09.542
Oh, great.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.208
That's the last thing we need.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.792
You know what? Don't worry about it.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.709
I think I know how I can handle this.

11:16.792 --> 11:17.792
Good.

11:17.875 --> 11:20.166
Because this new house is happening.

11:20.875 --> 11:22.500
I already ordered the gong
for my yoga room.

11:25.583 --> 11:26.709
Charlie.

11:26.792 --> 11:28.792
I think the other gurgles
might have something to say.

11:28.875 --> 11:30.875
We should ask them.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.041
Hey, Charlie.

11:34.125 --> 11:37.625
The rest of us gurgles
think a new house would be fun.

11:37.709 --> 11:39.333
Isn't that right, Star?

11:39.417 --> 11:40.792
That's right, Square.

11:40.875 --> 11:43.875
Circle doesn't know
what he's talking about.

11:43.959 --> 11:45.500
This is insulting.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.083
We should get out of here.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.250
Charlie.

11:51.333 --> 11:52.834
I said "We."

12:04.917 --> 12:06.458
Hey, Charlie.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.625
So we have to talk about the new house.

12:08.709 --> 12:10.458
Shh.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.709
Hello there, miss piggy.
You're looking very beautiful today.

12:12.792 --> 12:14.625
Aw, that's so sweet...

12:14.709 --> 12:16.709
- Aw.
- ...Even if it is obvious.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.625
- Kermit: okay, I can't wait--
- Can you turn that down please?

12:25.125 --> 12:26.333
Hello?

12:26.417 --> 12:28.208
No, that's good to know,

12:28.291 --> 12:30.458
but there's no Ed Johnson here.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.667
Okay.

12:34.709 --> 12:36.125
Stupid wrong numbers.

12:36.208 --> 12:38.500
Hey, just out of curiosity,

12:38.583 --> 12:40.166
what did they want?

12:40.250 --> 12:42.667
I don't know.
Something about a banquet starting.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.083
Weird.

12:46.333 --> 12:47.583
You know...

12:47.667 --> 12:49.500
It's a nice night.

12:50.458 --> 12:52.583
I think I’m gonna go take a walk.

12:54.667 --> 12:57.166
Gabe, why are you wearing a blazer?

12:57.250 --> 12:59.208
Oh, I’m, uh,

12:59.291 --> 13:02.250
just taking a little more interest
in my appearance.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.500
Hey, it had to happen sometime, huh?

13:05.750 --> 13:07.166
Okay. I’ll see you guys later.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.291
He's up to something, isn't he?

13:12.417 --> 13:13.750
Yep.

13:13.834 --> 13:17.250
But he's hotel security's problem now.

13:22.709 --> 13:24.041
Teddy.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.792
- Oh.
- Try this.

13:26.959 --> 13:28.041
Mm.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.917
Mom, that's delicious.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.208
It's what I do.

13:42.709 --> 13:44.166
Hi-ho, Teddy.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.291
- Kermit?
- Mm-hmm.

13:47.375 --> 13:48.417
Is it really you?

13:48.500 --> 13:51.000
Uh, yes. It's really me.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.542
Wow.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.709
You look just like you do on tv.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.417
Only, um...

13:59.333 --> 14:00.458
Better?

14:00.542 --> 14:01.750
Well, thank you.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.959
I was hoping for greener, but that'll do.

14:04.041 --> 14:06.458
Um... Kermit,

14:06.542 --> 14:08.083
what are you doing here?

14:08.166 --> 14:09.458
Ah, well actually,

14:09.542 --> 14:11.667
I heard that you were
tearing your whole house down

14:11.750 --> 14:13.583
and gonna make it all new.

14:14.083 --> 14:15.250
How'd you hear that?

14:15.333 --> 14:17.250
Oh, fozzie bear ran into your contractor

14:17.333 --> 14:18.583
at a comedy club.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.250
Not funny, by the way.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.041
Fozzie bear or the contractor?

14:23.125 --> 14:24.458
Uh-huh.

14:24.542 --> 14:25.750
Yeah.

14:25.834 --> 14:27.041
Well listen, Teddy,

14:27.125 --> 14:28.667
I’m here to ask you a question.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.041

Charlie, you were right.

17:37.041 --> 17:38.875
We have to save our house.

17:38.959 --> 17:40.375
Yay!

17:41.458 --> 17:43.041
Let's go find Mom and Dad.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.667
I should have known it was a dream.

17:46.959 --> 17:48.458
It all started with Mom

17:48.542 --> 17:50.125
cooking something delicious.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.500
Tou want to tell me what's going on...

18:14.583 --> 18:16.000
Ted?

18:16.083 --> 18:17.417
It's Ed.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.709
The "T" is silent.

18:19.709 --> 18:20.834
All right.

18:20.917 --> 18:22.000
Whatever your name is,

18:22.083 --> 18:23.250
start talking.

18:24.709 --> 18:26.709
Dad, I just couldn't eat anymore

18:26.792 --> 18:28.417
peanut butter sandwiches.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.959
Then I found this room,
and they were giving out free food,

18:31.041 --> 18:32.792
so I just pretended to be an accountant.

18:32.875 --> 18:34.291
Hey, Ed. Who's this?

18:37.792 --> 18:39.500
Frank Johnson.

18:39.583 --> 18:40.709
Ed's Dad.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.417
Oh, so you must be an accountant too.

18:42.542 --> 18:44.834
Yeah. Taught him everything he knows.
Could you pass me the salt?

18:54.959 --> 18:57.458
Line dancing and cabbage eating.

18:57.542 --> 19:00.250
Man, I've been wanting to bring those two
together for years.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.875
We are so getting kicked out of here.

19:02.959 --> 19:04.166
Okay, everybody.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.875
Make sure you dance really hard.

19:05.959 --> 19:08.250
Extra cabbage for the loudest stomper.

19:11.041 --> 19:12.625
Five, six, seven, eight.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.917
Come in.

19:23.709 --> 19:24.959
What is going on in here?

19:25.041 --> 19:26.417
Line dancing.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.333
And what is that smell?

19:29.375 --> 19:30.500
Cabbage.

19:32.583 --> 19:34.083
Line dancing and cabbage eating?

19:34.166 --> 19:35.208
Both: mm-hmm.

19:35.250 --> 19:38.417
I've been wanting to
bring those two together for years.

19:38.500 --> 19:39.583
What?

19:39.667 --> 19:40.917
Pump up the volume,

19:41.000 --> 19:42.583
and somebody cabbage me!

19:42.667 --> 19:44.583
Yee-haw!

19:49.667 --> 19:51.500
We're never getting out of this place,
are we?

19:51.583 --> 19:53.000
Nope.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.500
Guess there's only one thing left to do.

19:55.583 --> 19:56.959
We dance!

20:12.834 --> 20:14.166
You gonna get seconds?

20:14.250 --> 20:16.041
Well, I gotta get something before thirds.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.250
And now, let's welcome

20:19.333 --> 20:20.625
this year's keynote speaker,

20:20.709 --> 20:22.041
Ed Johnson.

20:25.542 --> 20:27.041
What?

20:27.125 --> 20:29.041
Sounds like you're giving a speech.

20:29.125 --> 20:30.834
Good thing you wore the blazer.

20:31.542 --> 20:32.834
Go get 'em, Ed!

20:32.917 --> 20:34.709
Whoo!

20:36.709 --> 20:38.375
Thank you...

20:39.709 --> 20:41.000
Number lovers.

20:42.917 --> 20:45.041
I think you should hear

20:45.125 --> 20:47.083
from the man who taught me

20:47.166 --> 20:50.458
everything I know
about our beloved profession.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.375
My dad,

20:52.709 --> 20:53.709
Frank Johnson.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.083
Frank's not very happy.

21:02.166 --> 21:03.166
Yeah. What accountant is?

21:11.083 --> 21:12.667
Certified public accounting.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.166
Pluses and minuses.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.458
Addition and subtraction.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.750
What else can you say about accounting?

21:28.750 --> 21:30.750
I've got someone I'd like you to meet.

21:30.834 --> 21:32.500
Oh yeah? Who?

21:32.583 --> 21:34.625
Ted Johnson.

21:35.625 --> 21:37.041
Hi. Very nice to--

21:37.125 --> 21:38.709
Dad, the jig's up!

21:38.792 --> 21:39.709
Good night, everybody!

21:49.709 --> 21:51.625
So I got the final cost
on your dream house.

21:51.709 --> 21:52.834
Sorry it took so long,

21:52.917 --> 21:54.834
I was having some trouble
with my calculator.

21:54.917 --> 21:56.333
Oh, that's okay.

21:56.417 --> 21:59.500
Turns out it needed a new battery.

21:59.583 --> 22:00.792
The good news is,

22:00.875 --> 22:02.125
I have a terrific new joke

22:02.208 --> 22:05.500
about battery replacement.
Want to hear it?

22:05.583 --> 22:07.500
Both: No.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.375
It's no charge.

22:10.709 --> 22:11.792
Is that it?

22:16.667 --> 22:17.792
Yeah.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.875
Oh, there you guys are.

22:21.959 --> 22:23.333
Um, Mom, Dad...

22:24.542 --> 22:26.667
So Charlie was right.

22:26.750 --> 22:28.875
We can't build a new house.

22:28.959 --> 22:31.625
Let me guess, did the gurgles
talk to you too?

22:32.875 --> 22:33.792
No.

22:33.875 --> 22:34.959
The muppets did.

22:35.291 --> 22:37.583
Kermit and miss piggy
appeared in my dream.

22:37.667 --> 22:38.875
They were very persuasive

22:38.959 --> 22:40.834
and made some excellent points...

22:41.125 --> 22:42.750
musically.

22:44.750 --> 22:46.208
Guys, come on.

22:46.291 --> 22:50.041
We are not changing our plans
based on a talking doll

22:50.125 --> 22:51.667
and a dream.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.667
So with everything you said you wanted,

22:53.750 --> 22:55.750
this is how much your new house
is gonna cost.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.834
Whoa.

23:02.709 --> 23:04.083
Um...

23:05.208 --> 23:06.709
So what did Kermit say?

23:12.709 --> 23:14.625
Well-- ah.

23:14.709 --> 23:15.917
Great news, Charlie,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
we're rebuilding our old house.

23:18.083 --> 23:20.625
And we couldn't have done it without you

23:20.709 --> 23:22.500
and your imaginary friend,

23:22.583 --> 23:24.500
and me, and the muppets,

23:24.583 --> 23:25.583
and...

23:29.166 --> 23:30.583
Can I help you?

23:31.792 --> 23:33.083
I saw the camera.

23:33.166 --> 23:35.750
I thought maybe
it's my chance to get discovered.

23:35.834 --> 23:37.542
Oh, um...

23:37.625 --> 23:40.166
I’m just making a video
for my little sister.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.667
Does she like jokes?

23:42.917 --> 23:44.083
I guess.

23:45.250 --> 23:46.583
Knock knock.

23:47.125 --> 23:48.458
Who's there?

23:48.542 --> 23:49.667
Doorbell delivery.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.667
Doorbell delivery who?

23:51.750 --> 23:52.917
No, that's the whole joke.

23:54.125 --> 23:55.834
I’m-- I’m not sure you understand

23:55.917 --> 23:57.458
how knock knock jokes work.

23:57.542 --> 23:58.625
Well, who's the comedian here?

24:00.625 --> 24:02.542
I’m not sure there is one.

24:04.709 --> 24:06.542
The thing is, is I’m knocking

24:06.625 --> 24:08.041
because there is no doorbell.

24:08.125 --> 24:09.333
You see...

24:09.417 --> 24:11.125
- I’m delivering it.
- Good luck, Charlie.

24:14.709 --> 24:16.417
Miss piggy: Oh, Charlie.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.542
Can we ask you a question?

24:18.625 --> 24:19.875
Okay.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.125
Which do you like better?

24:21.208 --> 24:23.792
A frog or a pig?

24:23.875 --> 24:25.375
- Oh.
- Uh...

24:25.458 --> 24:26.583
Charlie, I'd be very careful

24:26.667 --> 24:28.166
about how I answered that.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.208
I like them both.

24:31.250 --> 24:34.083
But if you had to choose just one,

24:34.166 --> 24:35.583
and you have to.

24:37.917 --> 24:39.583
I like bears.

24:40.667 --> 24:41.792
Aah!

24:41.875 --> 24:43.792
That's a beary good answer.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.083
Bears over pigs?

24:47.166 --> 24:48.291
What?

24:48.375 --> 24:50.875
Oh, I'd get moving if I were you.

24:50.959 --> 24:53.875
Come back here,
you little bear lover, you!

24:53.959 --> 24:54.875
Miss Piggy: Come back!

24:56.375 --> 24:57.959
Hey, good luck, Charlie.
