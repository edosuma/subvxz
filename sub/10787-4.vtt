WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:04.750
I'M BORED.

00:04.750 --> 00:05.792
GOOD.

00:05.792 --> 00:07.041
GOOD?
MM-MMM.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.333
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT ME

00:08.333 --> 00:10.875
IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT
TRAGEDY I'VE SUFFERED.

00:10.875 --> 00:11.917
PACEY,
IT'S PRECISELY

00:11.917 --> 00:13.500
BECAUSE OF THE RECENT
TRAGEDY YOU SUFFERED

00:13.500 --> 00:14.083
THAT YOU COULD USE
A LITTLE BOREDOM.

00:14.083 --> 00:15.625
NOW KEEP READING.

00:15.625 --> 00:16.834
I'M SERIOUS HERE, JO.

00:16.834 --> 00:17.959
WHAT'S THE POINT OF READING
A BOOK ABOUT THE FUTURE

00:17.959 --> 00:19.542
WHEN THE FUTURE IN THE BOOK
IS ALREADY THE PAST?

00:19.542 --> 00:23.041
EVERYBODY'S FUTURE
EVENTUALLY BECOMES
THE PAST, PACEY.

00:23.041 --> 00:23.834
YEAH, BUT 1984?

00:23.834 --> 00:25.834
BIG WHOOP. IT HAPPENED.

00:25.834 --> 00:27.166
IT'S OVER.
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

00:27.166 --> 00:28.667
AND HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
YOU WERE IN DIAPERS
AT THE TIME.

00:28.667 --> 00:30.291
VH1 BEHIND THE MUSIC,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.875
THE POINT IS,
THESE PEOPLE
IN THE FIFTIES,

00:32.875 --> 00:34.500
THEY SPEND
THEIR WHOLE LIVES
WORRYING ABOUT

00:34.500 --> 00:35.583
WHAT THE FUTURE'S
GONNA BE LIKE,

00:35.583 --> 00:37.542
AND WHEN IT GETS HERE,
TURNS OUT IT'S OK.

00:37.542 --> 00:38.792
EXCEPT FOR THAT
WHOLE BOY GEORGE THING,

00:38.792 --> 00:40.542
BUT WHO COULD HAVE
PREDICTED THAT, HUH?

00:42.333 --> 00:43.917
WHAT'S THIS STUFF?

00:44.792 --> 00:46.667
OH, NOTHING.
IT'S JUST JUNK MAIL.

00:46.667 --> 00:47.792
JUNK MAIL?

00:47.792 --> 00:49.959
IT'S JUST
COLLEGE MAIL

00:49.959 --> 00:51.041
THAT CAME OVER
THE SUMMER.

00:51.041 --> 00:54.208
YOU GET JUNK MAIL
FROM PRINCETON UNIVERSITY?

00:54.208 --> 00:55.834
IT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

00:55.834 --> 00:56.583
IT COMES
FROM EVERYWHERE.

00:56.583 --> 00:58.542
I MEAN,
LIKE FOR INSTANCE,

00:58.542 --> 01:00.542
LIKE I'M GONNA GO
TO ST. OLAF COLLEGE?

01:00.542 --> 01:02.083
OR, UH, UNIVERSITY
OF HAWAII.

01:02.083 --> 01:05.041
OR, UH, VALPARAISO
UNIVERSITY.

01:05.041 --> 01:06.000
WHERE IS THAT?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.667
IT'S LIKE IN BRAZIL
OR SOMETHING.

01:08.792 --> 01:10.250
BUT YOU ARE
GONNA GO SOMEWHERE?

01:13.875 --> 01:17.125
WELL, NOT
RIGHT THIS SECOND.

01:18.792 --> 01:19.875
I MEAN, IT'S
EARLY YET ANYWAY,

01:19.875 --> 01:23.083
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I'LL JUST...

01:23.083 --> 01:25.417
MAYBE I'LL JUST
GO TO ONE OF THOSE
FICTIONAL COLLEGES.

01:25.417 --> 01:29.917
YOU KNOW,
LIKE ON THOSE LAME
HIGH SCHOOL TV SHOWS

01:29.917 --> 01:31.542
THAT GO ON
FOR WAY TOO LONG.

01:31.542 --> 01:32.959
AND THEN, JUST
IN TIME TO SAVE
THE FRANCHISE,

01:32.959 --> 01:35.291
ALL OF THE SUDDEN
IT TURNS OUT

01:35.291 --> 01:37.625
THAT THERE'S
THIS AMAZING
WORLD CLASS COLLEGE

01:37.625 --> 01:38.834
THAT'S RIGHT AROUND
THE CORNER

01:38.834 --> 01:40.375
WHERE ALL THE
PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS
ARE ACCEPTED.

01:43.208 --> 01:45.542
JUST TO BE SAFE,
WE SHOULD
PROBABLY START

01:45.542 --> 01:46.917
THE APPLICATION
PROCESS.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.583
Advisor: SO,
MS. LINDLEY, IT SAYS HERE
YOU WANNA GO TO COLLEGE?

02:37.583 --> 02:39.458
WELL, I DID,
UNTIL I REALIZED

02:39.458 --> 02:41.250
HOW MANY LITTLE FORMS
I WAS GONNA HAVE
TO FILL OUT.

02:41.250 --> 02:42.333
BUT I--I--I--I INTEND
TO GET STARTED,

02:42.333 --> 02:44.875
I--I DO. I'VE JUST
BEEN REALLY BUSY WITH...

02:44.875 --> 02:45.708
FOOTBALL.

02:45.708 --> 02:46.834
I KNOW IT'S
NOT GONNA HELP ME

02:46.834 --> 02:47.667
GET INTO COLLEGE.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.625
BUT I DID
START THIS THING,

02:48.625 --> 02:50.083
AND I DON'T WANNA
QUIT UNTIL IT'S...

02:50.083 --> 02:51.041
DONE.

02:51.041 --> 02:52.375
I AM SO GLAD

02:52.375 --> 02:53.875
THAT I DID
THIS EARLY ACTION THING.

02:53.875 --> 02:56.083
OH, IT'S JUST LIKE
THIS GIANT WEIGHT
HAS BEEN...

02:56.083 --> 02:57.125
PLACED FIRMLY
AROUND MY NECK,

02:57.125 --> 02:58.125
I MEAN,
IT'S A BIG DECISION.

02:58.125 --> 02:59.125
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
I CAN AFFORD

02:59.125 --> 03:00.667
TO APPLY
TO A ZILLION PLACES.

03:00.667 --> 03:02.000
EVERYONE JUST ASSUMES
I'M GOING TO FILM SCHOOL.

03:02.000 --> 03:02.875
Advisor:
AND YOU'RE NOT?

03:02.875 --> 03:03.875
WELL, I'M NOT
RULING ANYTHING OUT.

03:03.875 --> 03:05.166
I MEAN, MAYBE I WILL,
AND MAYBE I WON'T.

03:05.166 --> 03:06.333
IF THE APTITUDE TEST
SAYS

03:06.333 --> 03:08.375
I'M WELL-SUITED
FOR A CAREER
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT,

03:08.375 --> 03:10.750
IT'S OBVIOUSLY
IN SOME SERIOUS NEED
OF RETOOLING.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.542
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
TALKING TO MY BROTHER,
HAVE YOU?

03:12.542 --> 03:14.792
HA HA HA! SHE SAID WHAT?

03:14.792 --> 03:17.000
Advisor: YOUR SISTER
TELLS ME YOU'RE NOT
QUITE AS FAR ALONG

03:17.000 --> 03:19.959
IN THE COLLEGE APPLICATION
PROCESS AS YOU COULD BE.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.458
DO YOU KNOW MY SISTER?

03:21.458 --> 03:24.208
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE I SHOULD
BE DOING AT THIS POINT?

03:24.208 --> 03:27.375
I MEAN COULDN'T WE
CALL OR SOMETHING?

03:27.375 --> 03:28.041
HOW CAN ANYBODY BE SURE

03:28.041 --> 03:29.875
WHERE THEY WANT TO SPEND

03:29.875 --> 03:30.875
THE NEXT 4 YEARS
OF THEIR LIFE?

03:30.875 --> 03:31.875
AND I'M SO SICK
OF ANSWERING

03:31.875 --> 03:32.875
THESE LAME
QUESTIONS LIKE...

03:32.875 --> 03:34.333
WHERE DO I SEE MYSELF
IN 5 YEARS?

03:34.333 --> 03:36.625
JUST WISH ME LUCK, LADY.
I'LL PROBABLY STILL BE HERE.

03:36.625 --> 03:38.542
I'M ACTUALLY THE FIRST
PERSON IN MY FAMILY

03:38.542 --> 03:39.542
TO EVEN APPLY
TO COLLEGE.

03:39.542 --> 03:41.500
THAT CAN WORK
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.708
ELITE SCHOOLS
ARE GENERALLY LOOKING

03:42.708 --> 03:44.375
FOR PEOPLE
WITH DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS.

03:44.375 --> 03:45.708
YOU'RE AT THE TOP
OF YOUR CLASS, JOEY.

03:45.708 --> 03:46.834
THE TOP TOP?

03:46.834 --> 03:50.041
NUMBER 4, AND YOUR
BOARD SCORES ARE PHENOMENAL.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.917
I THINK THAT
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE

03:51.917 --> 03:53.625
TO GET INTO PRACTICALLY
ANY PLACE IN THE COUNTRY.

03:55.708 --> 03:57.542
AND THIS MUST BE WHERE
THE "BUT" COMES IN.

03:57.542 --> 04:01.375
WELL, THE IVYS,
GEORGETOWN, DUKE, STANFORD,

04:01.375 --> 04:03.041
I MEAN,
THESE SCHOOLS ACCEPT

04:03.041 --> 04:05.542
ONLY A MINISCULE AMOUNT
OF THE PEOPLE THAT APPLY.

04:05.542 --> 04:08.041
AND HARDLY ANYBODY
EVER GETS A FREE RIDE.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.917
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
I'VE SET MY SIGHTS TOO HIGH?

04:12.917 --> 04:14.792
IT'S A CRAPSHOOT.

04:14.792 --> 04:16.708
NOW, DO I THINK THAT YOU'RE
SMART AND TALENTED ENOUGH

04:16.708 --> 04:17.834
TO BE ONE OF
THOSE PEOPLE THAT GETS IN?

04:17.834 --> 04:21.583
YES. DO I THINK THAT
YOU SHOULD PREPARE YOURSELF

04:21.583 --> 04:26.250
FOR THE POSSIBILITY
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE?

04:26.250 --> 04:26.583
THAT COULDN'T HURT.

04:31.166 --> 04:34.291
Drue: JENNY! JENNY!
WHAT, YOU NO LONGER
ANSWER TO JENNY?

04:34.291 --> 04:36.708
NOT SINCE I LEFT
THE 212 AREA CODE.

04:36.708 --> 04:40.417
NOT SO FAST.
CAN I WALK YOU HOME?
CARRY YOUR BOOKS?

04:40.417 --> 04:42.000
BUY YOU A SODA
AT THE MALT SHOP?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.125
THAT'S WHAT
PEOPLE DO FOR FUN
AROUND HERE

04:43.125 --> 04:44.083
IN PLEASANTVILLE,
RIGHT?

04:44.083 --> 04:45.041
DRUE, I'M GOING
TO SAY THIS

04:45.041 --> 04:47.583
IN THE NICEST WAY
POSSIBLE--GO AWAY.

04:47.583 --> 04:48.708
IF I DIDN'T KNOW
BETTER, I'D THINK

04:48.708 --> 04:51.208
MAYBE YOU WEREN'T
EXACTLY HAPPY
TO SEE ME.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.333
NO! REALLY?

04:52.333 --> 04:53.375
HERE I AM,
YOUR OLD CHUM
FROM THE BIG CITY

04:53.375 --> 04:55.792
CAST ADRIFT
IN A ONE-HORSE TOWN

04:55.792 --> 04:57.208
WITH NO
DECENT CHINESE FOOD,

04:57.208 --> 04:59.375
AND YOU
DON'T ROLL OUT
THE RED CARPET,

04:59.375 --> 05:01.333
YOU DON'T SIT
WITH ME AT LUNCH,

05:01.333 --> 05:02.667
YOU DON'T
INTRODUCE ME
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.542
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU ALREADY SEEM
TO KNOW MY FRIENDS.

05:04.542 --> 05:05.708
THEY KNEW THAT YOU
WERE HERE BEFORE I DID,

05:05.708 --> 05:07.792
AND THEY DIDN'T WARN ME.
I WONDER WHY THAT IS, HUH?

05:07.792 --> 05:11.834
OK. BUSTED.

05:11.834 --> 05:13.083
I DIDN'T TELL THEM
I KNEW YOU.

05:13.083 --> 05:14.291
I WANTED TO LAY LOW,

05:14.291 --> 05:16.125
SOAK UP SOME
SECONDHAND IMPRESSIONS

05:16.125 --> 05:17.625
OF JEN LINDLEY,
VERSION 2.0.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.500
SO, WHAT
DO YOU SAY?

05:19.500 --> 05:22.625
YOU AND ME,
ONE MILKSHAKE,
2 STRAWS.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.875
CATCH UP
ON OLD TIMES.

05:24.875 --> 05:25.792
I'VE MISSED YOU
THESE PAST 2 YEARS.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.458
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
YOU DIDN'T MISS ME.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.250
YOU MISSED MY
IDIOTIC WILLINGNESS

05:30.250 --> 05:31.458
TO TRY OUT ANY
AND ALL ILLEGAL
SUBSTANCES

05:31.458 --> 05:32.417
THAT YOU HAPPENED
TO PURCHASE

05:32.417 --> 05:33.291
IN WASHINGTON SQUARE
PARK. REMEMBER?

05:33.291 --> 05:36.291
HEY, COME ON.
NOT ALL THAT ECSTASY

05:36.291 --> 05:37.750
TURNED OUT TO BE
SINUS HEADACHE MEDICATION.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.000
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE WE NEVER
HAD ANY FUN.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.834
DRUE, THE KIND OF
FUN THAT WE HAD, I
DON'T HAVE ANYMORE.

05:41.834 --> 05:43.125
SO I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE
HOPING TO GAIN

05:43.125 --> 05:44.333
BY THIS LITTLE TRIP
DOWN MEMORY LANE,

05:44.333 --> 05:45.542
BUT IT WON'T
GET YOU ANYWHERE.

05:45.542 --> 05:46.792
HEY, IT'S NOT
THAT I DON'T DIG

05:46.792 --> 05:48.375
THIS WHOLE
HIP-TO-BE-SQUARE
THING YOU GOT GOING ON,

05:48.375 --> 05:51.000
BECAUSE I DO.
I JUST THINK
WE SHOULD HANG OUT.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.125
HANG OUT?

05:52.125 --> 05:54.792
THAT'S ALL.
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

05:54.792 --> 05:56.458
NO WAY. NOT EVER.
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.542
UH, THEY'RE CLOSED.

06:00.542 --> 06:03.291
UH, IT'S OK.
I KNOW THE OWNER.

06:04.208 --> 06:05.834
OH, HEY.

06:05.834 --> 06:08.792
YOUR MOM'S
IN THE BACK. SOME
FISH-RELATED CRISIS.

06:08.792 --> 06:10.542
THAT'S THE ONLY KIND
THERE IS AROUND HERE.

06:10.542 --> 06:11.625
SO ARE YOU
STAKING OUT

06:11.625 --> 06:12.375
A SEAT FOR THE EARLY-BIRD
SPECIAL OR WHAT?

06:12.375 --> 06:15.834
NO. INTERVIEWING
FOR A JOB.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.583
THE BARTENDING JOB?

06:17.583 --> 06:19.542
HEY, I MAY NOT
BE COYOTE UGLY
MATERIAL,

06:19.542 --> 06:21.917
BUT I CAN MAKE
A SEVEN & SEVEN WITH
THE BEST OF THEM.

06:21.917 --> 06:23.667
I...BELIEVE YOU.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.583
SO, UH,
HOW'S IT GOING,

06:25.583 --> 06:26.583
THE INTERVIEW?

06:26.583 --> 06:28.208
OK, I GUESS.

06:28.208 --> 06:29.542
OR AT LEAST
I HOPE SO.

06:29.542 --> 06:30.875
I REALLY NEED
THIS JOB.

06:30.875 --> 06:32.291
I WAS TENDING
BAR ALL SUMMER

06:32.291 --> 06:33.250
UP IN
PROVINCETOWN.

06:33.250 --> 06:33.959
AND NOW THAT
THE TOURISTS
ARE GONE,

06:33.959 --> 06:36.000
BYE-BYE, JOB.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.250
Gale: HEY,
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

06:38.250 --> 06:39.583
TONIGHT'S SPECIAL
JUST CHANGED

06:39.583 --> 06:42.166
FROM RED SNAPPER
TO AHI TUNA. HI, HONEY.

06:45.542 --> 06:48.375
YOU KNOW, GRETCHEN,
EVERYTHING CERTAINLY
LOOKS GREAT ON PAPER,

06:48.375 --> 06:50.542
BUT I DO HAVE
ONE MORE QUESTION.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.000
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR SCHOOL?

06:52.000 --> 06:53.917
SCHOOL?

06:53.917 --> 06:56.041
COLLEGE. ARE YOU GOING
BACK ANY TIME SOON?

06:56.041 --> 06:57.125
BECAUSE
I WAS REALLY HOPING

06:57.125 --> 06:58.208
TO FIND SOMEBODY
WHO WAS WILLING

06:58.208 --> 06:59.333
TO STICK AROUND
FOR A WHILE.

06:59.333 --> 07:02.333
NO, I, UM,
I'M ON BREAK,

07:02.333 --> 07:04.792
YOU KNOW,
INDEFINITELY.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.250
IS THERE A REASON
FOR THAT?

07:06.250 --> 07:09.333
NOT A VERY
INTERESTING ONE.

07:09.333 --> 07:13.166
Dawson: SO, MOM,
YOU WANT ME TO, UH,
SET TABLES OR WHAT?

07:13.166 --> 07:15.083
UH, YEAH, HONEY,
IT IS GETTING LATE.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.333
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT,
GRETCHEN?

07:16.333 --> 07:19.875
INSTANT
DECISION TIME HERE.
CAN YOU START TOMORROW?

07:19.875 --> 07:22.125
YES. TOMORROW,
TODAY, YESTERDAY.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.208
THAT'S GREAT.

07:27.291 --> 07:31.125
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.
GENTLEMEN.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.917
[BLOWS WHISTLE]

07:32.917 --> 07:35.417
YOU GOT JACK INSIDE.

07:35.417 --> 07:37.750
GOOD CATCH, JACK.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.208
TAKE FIVE, MEN.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.959
NOT TOO MUCH WATER.

07:41.959 --> 07:43.667
DON'T WANT YOU CRAMPING UP
OUT THERE.

07:43.667 --> 07:44.792
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

07:44.792 --> 07:48.959
YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE
WHAT HAPPENED.

07:48.959 --> 07:49.500
SOMETHING GOOD,
SOMETHING BAD, WHAT?

07:49.500 --> 07:51.125
SOMETHING GOOD.

07:51.125 --> 07:54.583
OK, YOU KNOW
MISS WATSON,
THE COLLEGE ADVISOR?

07:54.583 --> 07:57.917
SHE ACTUALLY
CALLED HARVARD FOR ME.

07:57.917 --> 07:59.834
AND?

07:59.834 --> 08:01.792
AND THE WOMAN
SHE SPOKE TO

08:01.792 --> 08:04.792
NOT ONLY SAID
THAT EVERYTHING
LOOKED GOOD,

08:04.792 --> 08:05.667
BUT SHE REMEMBERED
MY ESSAY.

08:05.667 --> 08:09.125
MY ESSAY! OUT
OF THOUSANDS! MINE!

08:09.125 --> 08:11.000
THAT'S GREAT, ANDIE.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.959
Mitch: McPHEE!

08:12.959 --> 08:14.125
BREAK'S OVER.
LET'S GO.

08:14.125 --> 08:16.291
DUTY CALLS.

08:16.291 --> 08:17.500
OK.

08:18.291 --> 08:19.250
GO, TEAM!

08:19.250 --> 08:19.625
[BLOWS WHISTLE]

08:27.333 --> 08:30.875
YEOW! OH, OW!

08:30.875 --> 08:31.917
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
GOT IT?

08:31.917 --> 08:33.332
OK, OH!
OH, I'M SORRY.

08:33.332 --> 08:34.707
I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY.

08:34.707 --> 08:36.417
JACK, JACK, THAT--THAT
LOOKS A LOT WORSE

08:36.417 --> 08:37.457
THAN WHAT YOU
LED ME TO BELIEVE.

08:37.457 --> 08:38.457
YEAH. MY DAD
SAID YOU WEREN'T

08:38.457 --> 08:39.457
EVEN GONNA BE
IN SCHOOL TODAY.

08:39.457 --> 08:41.833
IT'S FINE.
IT'S NOTHING.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.792
THE WORST PART
ABOUT IT WAS
THE SOUND THAT IT MADE

08:43.792 --> 08:44.375
WHEN THEY
POPPED IT BACK IN.

08:44.375 --> 08:47.667
OH, IT WAS SO GROSS.

08:47.667 --> 08:48.417
YOU GUYS, ER  DOES
NOT PREPARE YOU

08:48.417 --> 08:50.458
FOR THAT KIND
OF STUFF.

08:50.458 --> 08:53.083
HEY, McPHEE.
SORRY ABOUT
THE SHOULDER.

08:53.083 --> 08:53.792
OH. YEAH.
THANKS.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.500
ANYTHING ELSE
WE CAN HELP
YOU WITH?

08:59.500 --> 09:00.667
YEAH. A BUNCH
OF US WERE JUST
KINDA WONDERING

09:00.667 --> 09:01.708
IF THE PARTY
WAS STILL ON.

09:01.708 --> 09:02.667
WHAT PARTY?

09:02.667 --> 09:03.959
WAS IT LIKE A SURPRISE
OR SOMETHING?

09:03.959 --> 09:05.208
IS WHAT
A SURPRISE?

09:05.208 --> 09:06.041
THE BIRTHDAY PARTY.

09:06.041 --> 09:08.875
HEY, LINDLEY.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

09:08.875 --> 09:10.834
PARTY TONIGHT, DUDE?
YOU KNOW IT, DUDE.

09:10.834 --> 09:13.208
OK, JEN. YOU
DID NOT TELL ME IT
WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY.

09:13.208 --> 09:14.000
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

09:14.000 --> 09:14.959
NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT.

09:14.959 --> 09:16.500
YEAH, IT'S NOT.
HER BIRTHDAY'S IN MAY.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.041
SO IT'S NOT
YOUR BIRTHDAY,

09:19.041 --> 09:20.041
AND YET PEOPLE
WHO CALL EACH OTHER DUDE

09:20.041 --> 09:22.000
SEEM TO BE ATTENDING
YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.708
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO LOOK INTO THAT.

09:23.708 --> 09:25.708
YEAH. HA HA.

09:35.166 --> 09:36.542
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

09:36.542 --> 09:38.041
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
WHEN YOU DREAM

09:38.041 --> 09:42.375
THAT YOUR TEETH
ARE SLOWLY RECEDING
BACK INTO YOUR HEAD

09:42.375 --> 09:45.750
AND THE WORLD'S
LEADING EXPERTS
ARE POWERLESS TO STOP IT?

09:45.750 --> 09:49.125
IT MEANS YOU SHOULDN'T
STAY UP ALL NIGHT
STRESSING ABOUT COLLEGE.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.708
YOU'LL GET IN
SOME PLACE GREAT,

09:50.708 --> 09:53.041
THEY'LL GIVE YOU
TONS OF FINANCIAL AID,

09:53.041 --> 09:54.208
AND EVERYTHING
WILL BE PERFECT.

09:54.208 --> 09:58.083
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT,
TOO, UNTIL YESTERDAY.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.125
WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY?

09:59.125 --> 10:01.417
[SIGHS]

10:01.417 --> 10:03.000
I HAD A MEETING
WITH A NEW
COLLEGE ADVISOR.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.750
SO?

10:05.750 --> 10:06.625
I'M FOURTH.

10:06.625 --> 10:10.625
FOURTH? FOUR--FOURTH
IN YOUR CLASS?

10:10.625 --> 10:13.875
[GASPS]
JOEY, THAT'S AMAZING.

10:13.875 --> 10:17.750
YEAH.
IT'S AMAZING, BUT...

10:17.750 --> 10:21.834
[SIGHS]
BESSIE, ALL OF THE PLACES

10:21.834 --> 10:23.375
THAT I THOUGHT
I WANTED TO APPLY TO,

10:23.375 --> 10:24.792
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE
WHO ARE NUMBER 4,

10:24.792 --> 10:27.917
AND THEY'RE, YOU KNOW,
CONCERT VIOLINISTS,

10:27.917 --> 10:30.083
OR THEY WON THE
WESTINGHOUSE SCIENCE PRIZE,

10:30.083 --> 10:33.208
OR THEY'RE LEGACIES
LIKE ANDIE. I MEAN...

10:34.708 --> 10:37.333
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
EVEN BOTHER, I MEAN...

10:37.333 --> 10:40.375
I--I'D PROBABLY
JUST BE WASTING
THE APPLICATION FEES.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.291
YOUR
DEFEATIST ATTITUDE
HAS GOT TO GO.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.625
WHAT DOES PACEY SAY?

10:44.625 --> 10:46.708
PACEY'S BARELY
GONNA GRADUATE.

10:46.708 --> 10:48.083
I CAN'T EXACTLY
CRY ON HIS SHOULDER

10:48.083 --> 10:51.667
ABOUT MY TRAGIC LACK
OF EXTRACURRICULAR
ACTIVITIES.

10:51.667 --> 10:53.583
IF I TELL PACEY
HOW STRESSED I AM,

10:53.583 --> 10:58.208
HE'S JUST GONNA THINK
THAT I'M THIS PATHETIC,
WHINY CRYBABY, YOU KNOW?

10:58.208 --> 11:01.125
LOOK, GOING TO ONE
OF THESE SCHOOLS

11:01.125 --> 11:02.333
COULD OPEN UP
OPPORTUNITIES

11:02.333 --> 11:04.959
YOU'VE
ALWAYS DREAMED
ABOUT, RIGHT?

11:04.959 --> 11:06.083
YES.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.500
SO YOUR DREAMS
ARE YOUR DREAMS, JOEY.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.500
YOU CAN'T APOLOGIZE
FOR THEM.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.792
JUST TALK TO HIM.
YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND OUT
THEY'RE HIS DREAMS, TOO.

11:24.041 --> 11:24.500
UNACCEPTABLE.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.291
EXCUSE ME?

11:26.291 --> 11:28.667
YOU THROWING ME
A BIRTHDAY PARTY.
UNACCEPTABLE.

11:28.667 --> 11:29.625
SO YOU FOUND OUT
ABOUT THAT.

11:29.625 --> 11:32.792
YEAH, WELL,
HOW COULD I NOT?

11:32.792 --> 11:34.000
I SPENT
THE ENTIRE MORNING

11:34.000 --> 11:35.708
FIELDING
BIRTHDAY WISHES FROM
COMPLETE STRANGERS.

11:35.708 --> 11:37.625
MY FRENCH CLASS
SANG TO ME
IN FRENCH.

11:37.625 --> 11:39.917
OH, BUMMER.
HEY, PALMER.

11:39.917 --> 11:40.917
HEY, DRUE.

11:40.917 --> 11:41.959
JASON, I'LL SEE YOU
THERE, RIGHT, DUDE?

11:41.959 --> 11:43.166
OH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW IT, MAN.

11:43.166 --> 11:44.500
EXCELLENT.
ISN'T THIS GREAT?

11:44.500 --> 11:45.500
YESTERDAY, I DIDN'T
EVEN KNOW THAT GUY

11:45.500 --> 11:47.625
FROM A HOLE IN THE WALL.
TODAY, PAESANS.

11:47.625 --> 11:49.166
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS PARTY'S REALLY
BEEN A GREAT WAY

11:49.166 --> 11:50.375
FOR ME TO GET
TO KNOW PEOPLE.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.708
GOOD, BUT THE FACT THAT
IT'S NOT MY BIRTHDAY,

11:52.708 --> 11:54.667
THAT--THAT
PUTS NO DAMPER
ON THE FESTIVITIES, HUH?

11:54.667 --> 11:56.041
I LIKE
TO THINK OF TONIGHT

11:56.041 --> 11:58.708
AS AN OMNIBUS RETROACTIVE
BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION,
YOU KNOW?

11:58.708 --> 11:59.667
IT COVERS ALL THOSE
PARTIES WE MISSED
WHEN WE WERE APART,

11:59.667 --> 12:02.041
PLUS I'M DOING
A PUBLIC SERVICE.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.500
WE NEED TO GET YOU
OUT OF THIS FUNK
YOU'VE BEEN IN

12:04.500 --> 12:05.834
SINCE PHANTOM FRESHMAN
DUMPED YOU.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.959
OK, FIRST OF ALL,
HE DIDN'T DUMP ME.
I DUMPED HIM.

12:07.959 --> 12:09.375
TECHNICALITY.
SECOND,

12:09.375 --> 12:10.875
THIS ISN'T A FUNK.
IT'S MY PERSONALITY.

12:10.875 --> 12:12.708
HARSH.
THIRD, IT'S NOT
MY BIRTHDAY.

12:12.708 --> 12:13.875
ANOTHER TECHNICALITY.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.041
LOOK, I WANT TO LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET, OK?

12:16.041 --> 12:17.959
SOMETHING THE OLD
JEN LINDLEY USED TO KNOW.

12:17.959 --> 12:20.083
PEOPLE ARE SHEEP.
THEY NEED A REASON
TO CELEBRATE,

12:20.083 --> 12:21.583
OK, AND THAT'S
WHERE I COME IN.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.583
I GIVE THEM SOMETHING
TO CELEBRATE. YOU.

12:23.583 --> 12:24.834
ANSWER ME ONE THING:
WHY ON EARTH

12:24.834 --> 12:25.792
WOULD I ACTUALLY ATTEND
THIS LITTLE SHINDIG?

12:25.792 --> 12:28.959
WELL, YOU CAN'T MISS
YOUR OWN BIRTHDAY.

12:28.959 --> 12:30.458
BUT IT'S NOT
MY BIRTHDAY.
I KNOW, I KNOW,

12:30.458 --> 12:31.500
BUT EVERYONE HERE
THINKS IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY,

12:31.500 --> 12:33.625
SO WORK WITH ME, OK?

12:33.625 --> 12:35.041
IF IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY
AND YOU DON'T SHOW UP,

12:35.041 --> 12:36.417
I GUESS THAT MAKES YOU
SORT OF A STUCK-UP.

12:36.417 --> 12:37.708
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T SAY IT, DRUE.

12:37.708 --> 12:38.959
I'D HATE FOR ENDANGERED
TURTLES TO DIE

12:38.959 --> 12:40.417
WHILE THEY'RE DRAGGING
THE CREEK FOR YOUR BODY.

12:40.417 --> 12:44.834
MMM. STARTS AT 8:00,
DRESS IS CASUAL,
BUT, UH, NOT THAT CASUAL.

12:44.834 --> 12:45.959
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GO HOME FIRST.

12:45.959 --> 12:47.667
SPIFF YOURSELF
UP A LITTLE, OK?

12:47.667 --> 12:47.917
SEE YOU LATER.

12:51.250 --> 12:55.000
YOU KNOW, JACK,
THINGS AREN'T AS BAD
AS YOU THINK THEY ARE.

12:55.000 --> 12:55.792
IN FACT,
THIS WHOLE INJURY

12:55.792 --> 12:57.834
COULD BE
A REALLY GOOD THING.

12:57.834 --> 12:59.333
OH, YEAH.
LET ME GUESS.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.750
IT'LL GIVE ME
MORE TIME TO WORK
ON MY APPLICATIONS?

13:01.750 --> 13:04.583
EXACTLY, 'CAUSE YOU DON'T
WANT TO GET BEHIND.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.000
NOT LIKE
YOU ALREADY AREN'T.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.250
[SIGHS]
LOOK, ANDIE,

13:07.250 --> 13:09.083
I AM IN SOME
SERIOUS PAIN HERE.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.917
CAN YOU JUST
LAY OFF THE LECTURES
FOR A LITTLE BIT,

13:10.917 --> 13:13.834
JUST UNTIL I GET
SOME PILLS IN ME?

13:13.834 --> 13:15.041
SURE THING.

13:15.041 --> 13:15.500
THANKS.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.708
ALTHOUGH...

13:17.708 --> 13:20.291
YOU MIGHT
WANT TO CONSIDER

13:20.291 --> 13:22.291
THAT THIS
WHOLE EXPERIENCE

13:22.291 --> 13:23.542
COULD MAKE A REALLY
GREAT ESSAY TOPIC.

13:23.542 --> 13:27.208
YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

13:27.208 --> 13:29.834
I'M GONNA
GET WORKING ON THAT
AS SOON AS I GET HOME.

13:29.834 --> 13:32.291
ARE WE DONE WITH
THIS LITTLE SHOPPING
EXCURSION OF OURS?

13:32.291 --> 13:34.041
ALMOST. I JUST WANT
TO GO IN THE BOOKSTORE

13:34.041 --> 13:36.375
AND GET A PRESENT
FOR JEN FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

13:36.375 --> 13:37.875
[SIGHS]
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT
ACTUALLY HER BIRTHDAY?

13:37.875 --> 13:40.375
I KNOW. IT JUST
SEEMS KIND OF RUDE

13:40.375 --> 13:41.083
TO SHOW UP EMPTY-HANDED.

13:50.291 --> 13:51.625
MM-HMM.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.959
I AM NEVER EATING
A HOME-COOKED MEAL
AGAIN, AM I?

13:53.959 --> 13:54.750
YEAH. LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE STUCK YET AGAIN

13:54.750 --> 13:57.000
WITH 4-STAR
GOURMET CUISINE.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.583
SO, UH, GRETCHEN
SEEMS TO BE WORKING OUT.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.500
UH, YEAH, SO FAR.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.291
I JUST WISH I KNEW

14:03.291 --> 14:04.083
THAT SHE WAS
GONNA BE AROUND

14:04.083 --> 14:05.083
FOR MORE THAN
A FEW MONTHS.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.834
NOW, WHY WOULD THIS
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL

14:06.834 --> 14:09.375
AND BRIGHT AND
TALENTED YOUNG WOMAN

14:09.375 --> 14:11.458
WHO COULD BE OFF AT COLLEGE
FURTHERING HER EDUCATION

14:11.458 --> 14:13.917
CHOOSE TO BE BACK
IN CAPESIDE TENDING BAR?

14:13.917 --> 14:15.750
BECAUSE MAYBE COLLEGE
ISN'T THE BE-ALL
AND END-ALL

14:15.750 --> 14:17.208
THAT PARENTS
MAKE IT OUT TO BE.

14:17.208 --> 14:18.542
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
MAYBE ONCE YOU GET PAST

14:18.542 --> 14:21.083
THE RHETORIC OF
ALL THESE GREAT BOOKS
THAT NOBODY READS,

14:21.083 --> 14:25.166
COLLEGE IS BASICALLY
JUST A HOLDING PEN
FOR 18- TO 22-YEAR-OLDS.

14:25.166 --> 14:27.000
LIKE ONE OF
THOSE AIRPORTS THAT
EVERYBODY HAS TO STOP AT

14:27.000 --> 14:28.208
ON THEIR WAY
TO SOMEPLACE ELSE?

14:28.208 --> 14:29.291
KIND OF LIKE PRISON
WITH A BETTER MEAL PLAN.

14:29.291 --> 14:30.750
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU'RE SAYING
THESE THINGS

14:30.750 --> 14:33.625
FOR THE ADOLESCENT THRILL
OF GETTING A RISE
OUT OF YOUR MOTHER.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.542
IT'S TRUE, MOM.
MOST PEOPLE AREN'T
IN COLLEGE TO LEARN.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.708
THEY'RE THERE
TO KILL BRAIN CELLS

14:36.708 --> 14:38.291
AND CO-MINGLE WITH
THE OPPOSITE SEX.

14:38.291 --> 14:39.708
WELL, NOT THAT
I'M COMPLAINING,

14:39.708 --> 14:42.542
BUT HOW DID I END UP
WITH THE ONLY 17-YEAR-OLD
IN THE COUNTRY

14:42.542 --> 14:44.208
WHO THINKS THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A BAD IDEA?

14:44.208 --> 14:46.458
WELL, I'M NOT OPPOSED
TO THOSE THINGS.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.542
I'M JUST SAYING
I THINK THE WHOLE IDEA
OF HIGHER EDUCATION

14:48.542 --> 14:50.083
IS A LITTLE BIT
OF A MISNOMER.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.291
YOU KNOW, I THINK
PEOPLE SHOULD CALL
THINGS WHAT THEY ARE.

14:52.291 --> 14:55.333
LIKE WHEN PEOPLE ARE RUNNING
AWAY FROM THEIR PROBLEMS,

14:55.333 --> 14:58.000
THEY SHOULD ADMIT
THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY
FROM THEIR PROBLEMS?

15:00.417 --> 15:02.500
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
SOMEBODY I KNOW?

15:02.500 --> 15:06.166
WELL, HONEY, YOUR FATHER AND I
COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

15:06.166 --> 15:08.458
THAT ALL OF
THE COLLEGE APPLICATIONS
ARRIVING IN THE MAILBOX

15:08.458 --> 15:12.500
SEEM TO BE
COMING FROM ZIP CODES
MORE THAN 1,000 MILES AWAY.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.375
RIGHT, AND YOU AND DAD
NEVER SUSPECTED

15:15.375 --> 15:16.417
THAT YOUR
MOVIE-OBSESSED SON

15:16.417 --> 15:18.333
MIGHT WANT TO GO
TO SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA?

15:18.333 --> 15:19.667
WELL, HONEY,
WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM

15:19.667 --> 15:22.417
IF YOU WANT
TO GO TO CALIFORNIA
OR NEW MEXICO OR ALASKA

15:22.417 --> 15:23.417
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT.

15:23.417 --> 15:25.959
WE JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO MAKE A DECISION

15:25.959 --> 15:27.375
THAT'S GONNA AFFECT
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

15:27.375 --> 15:28.542
BASED ON
THE WRONG CRITERIA.

15:28.542 --> 15:33.834
[SIGHS] LIKE?

15:33.834 --> 15:35.125
LIKE THE DESIRE
TO PUT AN ENTIRE CONTINENT

15:35.125 --> 15:38.083
BETWEEN YOU AND A CERTAIN GIRL
WE BOTH KNOW?

15:41.250 --> 15:42.125
Joey: IF I TELL YOU
WHAT'S BOTHERING ME,

15:42.125 --> 15:44.375
WILL YOU PROMISE
NOT TO LAUGH AT ME

15:44.375 --> 15:46.041
OR TELL ME I'M INSANE

15:46.041 --> 15:47.166
OR INSIST THAT I SHOULD
JUST GET OVER MYSELF?

15:47.166 --> 15:49.583
I THINK I CAN
PROBABLY DO THAT, YEAH.

15:49.583 --> 15:55.834
[SIGHS]
I FOUND OUT YESTERDAY
THAT I'M FOURTH.

15:55.834 --> 16:00.125
MY CLASS RANK.
I'M FOURTH.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.834
[LAUGHS]
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

16:02.834 --> 16:04.375
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.917
IF ANYTHING,
THAT'S A REASON
TO QUIT STUDYING.

16:05.917 --> 16:09.542
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I BOTHER.

16:09.542 --> 16:10.333
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
UNDERSTAND.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.792
OK, I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS BAD.

16:11.792 --> 16:15.250
CAN WE TRY THAT AGAIN?
YEAH? BUT THIS TIME,
YOU'VE GOTTA CUT OUT

16:15.250 --> 16:17.000
ALL THAT STUFF
ABOUT BEING NUMBER 4,

16:17.000 --> 16:18.708
'CAUSE I KNOW
THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY

16:18.708 --> 16:19.583
BE THE REASON
YOU'RE SO BOTHERED.

16:19.583 --> 16:23.500
WELL, NO, IT'S...

16:23.500 --> 16:24.291
IT'S JUST THAT
I ALWAYS THOUGHT

16:24.291 --> 16:25.375
THAT IF I DID WELL
IN SCHOOL,

16:25.375 --> 16:29.625
THAT THESE DOORS WOULD
OPEN FOR ME, YOU KNOW,

16:29.625 --> 16:32.083
AND--AND MAYBE
I WAS JUST BEING NAIVE.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.625
MAYBE I'VE JUST
SET THESE GOALS

16:33.625 --> 16:34.834
THAT ARE
REALLY UNREALISTIC,

16:34.834 --> 16:37.792
AND YOU KNOW, CERTAIN PEOPLE
GET INTO CERTAIN PLACES

16:37.792 --> 16:39.834
BECAUSE OF WHO
THEIR PARENTS ARE, HOW--

16:42.166 --> 16:42.834
YOU'RE NOT
EVEN LISTENING.

16:42.834 --> 16:45.792
UH, NO, I WAS LISTENING.

16:45.792 --> 16:49.792
LOOK, WE SHOULD JUST
ALL HAVE YOUR PROBLEMS,
YOU KNOW?

16:49.792 --> 16:51.917
YOU'RE SITTING HERE
AS A GIRL WITH ONE
OF THE BRIGHTEST FUTURES

16:51.917 --> 16:53.166
ON THE FACE
OF THE PLANET,

16:53.166 --> 16:55.000
TALKING TO A GUY
WHO'S NOT GONNA
GET INTO ANY SCHOOL

16:55.000 --> 16:56.917
WHERE THEY DON'T
GIVE HIM HIS OWN TOOLS.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.208
PUT YOUR SHOES ON.
LET'S GO OUT.

17:04.208 --> 17:05.125
OUT?

17:05.125 --> 17:06.083
WE CAN'T GO OUT.
YEAH.

17:06.083 --> 17:08.625
YOU KNOW, JUST WHEN
THIS CONVERSATION

17:08.625 --> 17:10.959
STARTS TO GET
EMOTIONALLY COMPLEX,
YOU WANT TO BAIL.

17:10.959 --> 17:12.666
WHO'S THE GUY IN
THIS RELATIONSHIP?

17:12.666 --> 17:14.125
YOU ARE, AND AS THE GUY,
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.165
YOU CAN EITHER STAY HERE

17:15.165 --> 17:16.500
AND PROVE HOW SENSITIVE
YOU AREN'T,

17:16.500 --> 17:19.125
OR WE CAN GO TO
JEN'S UN-BIRTHDAY PARTY.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.500
RIGHT.
I'LL GET MY SHOES.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.541
[ALL SCREAMING, LAUGHING]

17:42.208 --> 17:45.583
OOH. LOOK AT THAT.
THERE HE IS, OUR HOST.

17:45.583 --> 17:48.708
YOU KNOW, ON A GOOD DAY,
HE'LL RUIN YOUR CHANCES

17:48.708 --> 17:49.875
OF GETTING
INTO THE COLLEGE
OF YOUR CHOICE,

17:49.875 --> 17:51.917
CONVINCE YOU
HE'S THE SAUSAGE KING
OF CHICAGO,

17:51.917 --> 17:53.000
AND WRECK
YOUR FATHER'S CAR,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.500
BUT SOMEHOW,
YOU'LL END UP
THANKING HIM.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.250
CAN I ASK
THE INEVITABLE QUESTION?

18:00.125 --> 18:02.208
WAS HE MY BOYFRIEND? NO.

18:02.208 --> 18:05.417
WAS HE AN INDISCRETION?
YES.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.000
AH. HA HA HA.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.917
BUT TO BE QUITE HONEST,
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
WHAT HE REMEMBERS.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.291
WE WERE BOTH
CHEMICALLY ALTERED
AT THE TIME.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.417
I DON'T
THINK I NEED TO GO
ANY FURTHER THAN THAT.

18:22.333 --> 18:25.250
Pacey:
IT'S EXCITING.
CAN'T GET ENOUGH.

18:25.250 --> 18:29.208
WITTER.
I KNEW YOU COULDN'T
RESIST A PARTY.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.542
I SEE YOU'VE BROUGHT
THE PRIM REAPER.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.000
WE CAME FOR YOUR
IMMORTAL SOUL.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.667
THAT IS,
IF YOU GOT ONE.

18:34.667 --> 18:35.291
ACTUALLY,

18:35.291 --> 18:36.917
I'D JUST LIKE A DRINK.

18:36.917 --> 18:40.583
MM-HMM.
HERE'S ONE FOR YOU
AND FOR YOU.

18:40.583 --> 18:42.291
THANKS.
OH, NO, NO, NO.

18:42.291 --> 18:43.667
I DON'T THINK SO.

18:43.667 --> 18:45.333
IT IS A PROVEN FACT
THAT YOU, MADAM,

18:45.333 --> 18:46.417
CANNOT HOLD
YOUR ALCOHOL.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.417
SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.750
YOU CAN DRINK AT PARTIES
AND I CAN'T?

18:48.750 --> 18:51.500
YES, BECAUSE AS YOU
SO RIGHTLY POINTED OUT,
I AM A GUY,

18:51.500 --> 18:54.333
AND IF I'M GOING
TO GET IN TROUBLE
FOR BEING A GUY,

18:54.333 --> 18:55.959
I THINK
I SHOULD AT LEAST
GET TO ACT LIKE ONE

18:55.959 --> 18:57.625
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE...

18:57.625 --> 19:04.041
YOU KNOW, WITH YOUR
ADVANCE PERMISSION
AND APPROVAL.

19:04.041 --> 19:08.083
OF COURSE, I WOULDN'T,
YOU KNOW, DO IT
WITHOUT ASKING FIRST.

19:08.083 --> 19:12.083
THAT'S FINE.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.458
THAT'S FINE?

19:13.458 --> 19:18.125
YEAH. WE'LL BOTH
BE GUYS TONIGHT. CHEERS.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.500
Jen: DRUE.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.250
SO, THE GUEST OF HONOR
FINALLY DECIDES

19:33.250 --> 19:34.959
TO HONOR ME
WITH HER PRESENCE.

19:34.959 --> 19:37.834
MMM. UNAVOIDABLE.

19:37.834 --> 19:40.333
LISTEN, I'M WORKING
ON A LITTLE THEORY.

19:40.333 --> 19:40.917
THIS ISN'T
YOUR HOUSE, IS IT?

19:40.917 --> 19:44.333
[GASPS] I'M SHOCKED.

19:44.333 --> 19:47.834
HERE I WELCOME YOU
AND 65 OF YOUR CLOSEST
FRIENDS INTO MY HOME,

19:47.834 --> 19:51.375
AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME,
BY, UH, ACCUSING ME
OF WHAT EXACTLY?

19:51.375 --> 19:54.500
MISREPRESENTING
MY PLACE OF RESIDENCE?

19:54.500 --> 19:56.667
WHAT COULD I POSSIBLY GAIN
BY SUCH A TACTIC?

19:56.667 --> 19:59.333
WELL, PLAUSIBLE
DENIABILITY. I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

19:59.333 --> 20:02.125
SEE, IF YOU THROW
A WILD, RAUCOUS PARTY
AT YOUR OWN HOUSE,

20:02.125 --> 20:03.208
CHANCES ARE
YOU WILL GET CAUGHT.

20:03.208 --> 20:06.291
BUT IF YOU THROW
THE SAME PARTY

20:06.291 --> 20:07.750
AT SOME STRANGER'S
SUMMER HOUSE,

20:07.750 --> 20:09.333
THERE'S NOTHING
TO LINK YOU TO
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME,

20:09.333 --> 20:10.500
AND VOILA--

20:10.500 --> 20:12.583
PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY.

20:12.583 --> 20:14.959
HEY, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A PRETTY
SOPHISTICATED THEORY

20:14.959 --> 20:16.041
YOU GOT
GOING ON THERE.

20:16.041 --> 20:17.708
WELL, I'M A PRETTY
SOPHISTICATED KIND OF GIRL.

20:17.708 --> 20:21.458
YEAH.
OH, AND I ALMOST
FORGOT THE BEST PART.

20:21.458 --> 20:22.792
THE THING
THAT REALLY ELEVATES

20:22.792 --> 20:24.583
THIS WHOLE
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
JEN" THING

20:24.583 --> 20:26.208
FROM A MILDLY
AMUSING RUNNER

20:26.208 --> 20:28.041
TO A POTENTIALLY
INGENIOUS LITTLE
PLOT TWIST.

20:28.041 --> 20:29.792
UH, AND
THAT WOULD BE?

20:29.792 --> 20:31.417
SHOULD THE COPS
HAPPEN TO SHOW UP

20:31.417 --> 20:32.458
AND ASK
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS MESS,

20:32.458 --> 20:34.708
ALL THE DRUNKEN MASSES
ARE GONNA REMEMBER

20:34.708 --> 20:36.875
IS THAT
IT WAS JEN LINDLEY'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY.

20:36.875 --> 20:39.667
SO IT'S JUST
ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE
THAT MY INTENTIONS ARE PURE,

20:39.667 --> 20:42.041
THAT ALL I WANTED
TONIGHT WAS FOR YOU
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.792
[SIGHS]
WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY

20:43.792 --> 20:45.208
THAT IT'S
ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE,

20:45.208 --> 20:47.041
BUT I'D PUT THE CHANCES
SOMEWHERE AROUND 3%.

20:47.041 --> 20:48.250
[LAUGHS]
YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:48.250 --> 20:50.708
I HAVE A THEORY
ABOUT YOUR THEORY.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.208
I THINK
THE FIRST HALF IS RIGHT.

20:52.208 --> 20:53.667
I THINK
THIS ISN'T MY HOUSE.

20:53.667 --> 20:55.750
BECAUSE MAYBE MY HOUSE
ISN'T THE TYPE OF HOUSE

20:55.750 --> 20:57.333
THAT WOULD IMPRESS
ANYONE IN THIS TOWN,
LEAST OF ALL, YOU.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.667
MAYBE MY HOUSE
ISN'T EVEN A HOUSE.

21:00.667 --> 21:01.917
AND WHAT'S THIS,
SOME SORT OF RIDDLE?

21:01.917 --> 21:05.458
MMM. THE PARTY CALLS.
SEE YOU LATER,
BIRTHDAY GIRL.

21:15.083 --> 21:16.375
SO, UH, NUMBER 4
WITH A BULLET, HUH?

21:19.417 --> 21:21.083
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT,
DAWSON?

21:21.083 --> 21:24.000
KENNY REILING AND FRIENDS
HAVE ALREADY ESTABLISHED
A BETTING POOL.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.166
[SIGHS]
KIND OF PATHETIC,
ISN'T IT?

21:27.166 --> 21:30.291
I MEAN, 12 YEARS OF BEING
A TOTAL CONTROL FREAK
ABOUT SCHOOL,

21:30.291 --> 21:33.000
PRACTICALLY
GIVING MYSELF
AN ULCER

21:33.000 --> 21:35.208
HUNTING SNAILS
AND BUILDING
BALSA WOOD BRIDGES

21:35.208 --> 21:36.208
FOR EXTRA CREDIT,

21:36.208 --> 21:39.417
AND WHERE
DOES THAT GET ME?
FOURTH.

21:42.834 --> 21:46.125
JOEY, FOURTH IS AMAZING.

21:46.125 --> 21:47.500
I MEAN, THE RACE
ISN'T EVEN OVER YET.

21:47.500 --> 21:51.000
THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING
TONIGHT? CELEBRATING?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.041
[LAUGHS] YEAH.

21:53.041 --> 21:56.333
THE FUTURE. WHOOPEE!

21:56.333 --> 21:58.792
JOEY, EVERYTHING'S
WORKING OUT

21:58.792 --> 22:01.375
EXACTLY THE WAY
YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

22:01.375 --> 22:03.500
BETWEEN YOUR GRADES
AND YOUR SAT SCORES,
YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.000
NOT YOU, TOO, DAWSON.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.750
I MEAN, CAN'T 2 PEOPLE
SIT DOWN AND MAKE SMALL TALK

22:08.750 --> 22:10.750
WITHOUT THE SUBJECT
OF COLLEGE COMING UP?

22:10.750 --> 22:12.333
I MEAN,
ISN'T THAT POSSIBLE?

22:12.333 --> 22:14.291
I MEAN, WHAT'S NEXT?
ARE YOU GONNA ASK ME,

22:14.291 --> 22:17.166
UH, WHERE I SEE MYSELF
IN 5 YEARS?

22:17.166 --> 22:19.208
I DON'T HAVE TO.
AREN'T YOU
THE SAME GIRL

22:19.208 --> 22:21.500
WHO WANTED TO BE
AN ANTHROPOLOGIST
OR AN OCEANOGRAPHER?

22:21.500 --> 22:26.417
[LAUGHS] YEAH.

22:26.417 --> 22:29.667
DAWSON, DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA HOW MUCH MONEY
ANTHROPOLOGISTS MAKE?

22:29.667 --> 22:34.000
AND BESIDES,
I WAS JUST SAYING THAT
TO GET YOUR GOAT.

22:34.000 --> 22:38.250
I MEAN, YOUR BUTTONS
ARE SO EASY TO PUSH.
WELL, WERE SO EASY.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.583
SO YOU NEVER REALLY
HAD ANY DESIRE

22:40.583 --> 22:42.333
TO DO GREAT
AND HEROIC THINGS
WITH YOUR LIFE?

22:42.333 --> 22:44.792
SEE FARAWAY PLACES,
UNCOVER LOST
CIVILIZATIONS.

22:44.792 --> 22:47.417
WHEN IT COMES RIGHT
DOWN TO IT, YOU'D
BE JUST AS HAPPY

22:47.417 --> 22:48.750
HANGING AROUND HERE
IN CAPESIDE?

22:48.750 --> 22:54.166
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
DON'T PUT WORDS IN MY MOUTH.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.333
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

22:55.333 --> 22:56.500
WHY SOMEONE
WHO'S ABOUT TO
REAP THE BENEFITS

22:56.500 --> 22:59.708
OF SOMETHING
SHE'S WORKED FOR
HER ENTIRE LIFE,

22:59.708 --> 23:00.917
SHE'S TRYING
TO DROWN HERSELF

23:00.917 --> 23:02.375
IN SOME 80-PROOF
FRUIT PUNCH.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.834
LOOK,
DON'T DO THIS, DAWSON.

23:06.041 --> 23:08.708
OK. CHEERS.

23:13.875 --> 23:18.667
OK, THAT LOOKS GOOD.
POKER TIME, GENTLEMEN.
WHO'S PLAYING?

23:18.667 --> 23:21.083
HEY, HOW ABOUT YOU,
WITTER? YOU UP FOR
A LITTLE GAME OF CARDS,

23:21.083 --> 23:22.458
OR, UH, YOU HAVE
TO ASK PERMISSION FROM
THE OLD BALL AND CHAIN?

23:22.458 --> 23:24.792
YEAH, I'D BE HAPPY
TO JUST FIND

23:24.792 --> 23:26.291
THE OLD BALL
AND CHAIN RIGHT NOW.

23:26.291 --> 23:28.041
UH, YEAH,
I THINK I SAW HER
TALKING TO DAWSON.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.542
OH, NO, WAIT.
THAT'S WRONG.

23:29.542 --> 23:32.083
SHE TOOK A WALK
WITH THE BIRTHDAY GIRL,

23:32.083 --> 23:34.583
WHICH IS WHY
YOU SHOULD STAY HERE
AND PLAY CARDS WITH US.

23:34.583 --> 23:36.708
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
5-CARD DRAW.
YOU IN OR OUT?

23:36.708 --> 23:40.000
WELL,
IT'S YOUR MONEY.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.041
ALL RIGHT, JOEY.
I THINK THAT WE'VE
WALKED FAR ENOUGH.

23:44.041 --> 23:46.125
NOW, WHAT DID
YOU NEED TO TELL ME?

23:46.125 --> 23:48.417
IS HERE GOOD?

23:48.417 --> 23:49.458
YES, HERE IS GOOD.

23:49.458 --> 23:52.166
GOOD, BECAUSE I...

23:53.750 --> 23:55.208
WOULD LIKE
TO MAKE A TOAST.

23:55.208 --> 23:58.291
ALL THE LOVE
AND HAPPINESS
IN THE WORLD

23:58.291 --> 24:02.917
TO MY FRIEND,
JEN LINDLEY,
ON HER BIRTHDAY.

24:02.917 --> 24:07.250
WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, JOEY,
BUT, UM...

24:07.250 --> 24:08.375
YOU DO KNOW IT'S--IT'S
REALLY NOT MY BIRTHDAY.

24:08.375 --> 24:11.083
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
[LAUGHS]

24:11.083 --> 24:12.750
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT
REALLY FRIENDS.

24:12.750 --> 24:13.959
[BOTH LAUGH]

24:13.959 --> 24:18.041
I'M JUST KIDDING.
I'M KIDDING,
I'M--I'M KIDDING.

24:18.041 --> 24:23.542
WE ARE. I THINK WE ARE.
DO YOU THINK WE ARE?

24:23.542 --> 24:24.500
I CAN'T REALLY
EVEN PINPOINT

24:24.500 --> 24:25.792
EXACTLY WHEN
WE BECAME FRIENDS--

24:25.792 --> 24:27.417
YOU KNOW WHAT, JOEY?
LET'S NOT DELVE
TOO FAR INTO IT,

24:27.417 --> 24:28.458
'CAUSE THEN
WE'LL JUST REMEMBER

24:28.458 --> 24:30.625
WHY WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO HATE EACH OTHER.

24:30.625 --> 24:33.500
I DON'T HATE YOU.

24:33.500 --> 24:36.125
OH--
I LOVE YOU.

24:36.125 --> 24:38.458
[LAUGHS]
I KNOW--
I DO.

24:38.458 --> 24:43.166
NO, JOEY, JOEY,
YOU LOVE EVERYBODY
TONIGHT.

24:43.166 --> 24:43.875
JOEY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

24:43.875 --> 24:45.792
MMM?

24:45.792 --> 24:46.792
DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU CAN

24:46.792 --> 24:47.792
SUMMON UP
ENOUGH BRAIN POWER

24:47.792 --> 24:48.792
TO ANSWER
ONE LITTLE QUESTION?

24:48.792 --> 24:50.750
IS IT ABOUT OUR FUTURE?

24:50.750 --> 24:53.166
NO. NO, IT'S PURELY
ABOUT THE PRESENT.

24:53.166 --> 24:54.542
SHOOT.

24:54.542 --> 24:57.834
DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHERE DRUE LIVES?

24:57.834 --> 25:03.500
DING, DING, DING.
I DO KNOW THE ANSWER
TO THAT ONE.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.583
DRUE LIVES
IN AN APARTMENT

25:05.583 --> 25:07.458
AT THE YACHT CLUB
WITH HIS MOTHER.

25:10.041 --> 25:13.000
OK, AND WHAT--WHAT
ABOUT HIS FATHER?

25:15.333 --> 25:17.000
TAOS, NEW MEXICO,
I THINK.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.166
I GUESS HE RAN OFF
WITH SOME NEW AGE
CHIPPIE. NICE, HUH?

25:22.166 --> 25:23.834
LEFT THEM
HIGH AND DRY.

25:23.834 --> 25:27.250
"YOU, TOO, CAN GET
INTO THE COLLEGE
OF YOUR CHOICE."

25:27.250 --> 25:29.750
PLEASE TELL ME
THAT'S A PRIVATE JOKE
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

25:29.750 --> 25:33.542
IT'S NOT A JOKE.
IT'S A VERY HELPFUL BOOK.

25:33.542 --> 25:34.750
MAYBE SO, BUT AS
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT

25:34.750 --> 25:39.000
OR AN UN-BIRTHDAY
PRESENT, IT PRETTY
MUCH SUCKS.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.458
OK, WHAT'S
YOUR PROBLEM?

25:42.458 --> 25:45.500
MY PROBLEM IS THAT...

25:45.500 --> 25:47.708
NOT EVERYONE
WANTS TO SPEND

25:47.708 --> 25:50.333
EVERY WAKING
MOMENT OF LIFE
THINKING ABOUT COLLEGE,

25:50.333 --> 25:52.041
AND SOME OF US
WANT TO ACTUALLY ENJOY

25:52.041 --> 25:53.917
THE REMAINDER OF
OUR SENIOR YEAR, ANDIE.

25:53.917 --> 25:55.500
AND I DON'T?

25:55.500 --> 25:59.083
NO, YOU DON'T, 'CAUSE
EVER SINCE YOU FINISHED
YOUR APPLICATIONS,

25:59.083 --> 26:01.708
ALL YOU'VE BEEN DOING
IS GETTING ON MY CASE
ABOUT MINE, ANDIE.

26:01.708 --> 26:02.375
LOOK, DON'T
GET ME WRONG, OK?

26:02.375 --> 26:04.417
I'M--I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

26:04.417 --> 26:06.041
I'M GLAD
THAT EVERYTHING'S
GOING SO WELL,

26:06.041 --> 26:11.250
AND YOU'VE
GOT EVERYTHING...
UNDER CONTROL...

26:11.250 --> 26:13.875
BUT I DON'T NEED YOU
TO CONTROL MY LIFE...

26:13.875 --> 26:16.291
AND YOU CERTAINLY
DON'T NEED TO BRANCH
OUT INTO JEN'S.

26:16.291 --> 26:17.500
OH, SO YOU WANT ME
TO JUST STAND THERE
AND WATCH

26:17.500 --> 26:19.792
AS YOU BACK YOURSELF
INTO A CORNER

26:19.792 --> 26:21.667
AND TOTALLY RUIN
YOUR ENTIRE FUTURE?

26:21.667 --> 26:23.166
ANDIE, IT IS
NOT MY FUTURE

26:23.166 --> 26:24.542
THAT I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT AT THE MOMENT,
IT'S THE PRESENT.

26:24.542 --> 26:27.291
LOOK, 24 HOURS AGO,
MY SENIOR YEAR

26:27.291 --> 26:29.000
OFFICIALLY
BEGAN TO SUCK.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.458
THE ONLY THING I WAS
LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS YEAR,

26:30.458 --> 26:32.291
THE ONLY REASON
I FIT INTO THIS
DAMN HIGH SCHOOL

26:32.291 --> 26:33.250
WAS 'CAUSE
OF FOOTBALL.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.583
I DON'T EVEN
HAVE THAT ANYMORE.

26:34.583 --> 26:37.000
SO CAN WE PLEASE
JUST FORGET ABOUT
THE FUTURE FOR NOW?

26:37.000 --> 26:41.458
JUST FOR TONIGHT?
OK?

26:55.250 --> 26:56.208
Andie: OH,
THERE YOU GUYS ARE.

26:56.208 --> 26:57.417
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

26:57.417 --> 26:59.375
WELL, EXCEPT HERE,

26:59.375 --> 27:00.458
'CAUSE IF YOU WOULD
HAVE LOOKED HERE,

27:00.458 --> 27:01.417
YOU WOULD HAVE
FOUND US,

27:01.417 --> 27:03.542
'CAUSE THIS, ANDIE,
IS WHERE WE ARE.

27:03.542 --> 27:06.375
[WHISPERING]
Ignore her.

27:06.375 --> 27:07.417
SO, WHERE'S JACK?

27:07.417 --> 27:10.166
HE'S AVOIDING ME.
AM I TOO CONTROLLING?

27:10.166 --> 27:11.291
Both: YES.

27:11.291 --> 27:13.041
THANKS FOR THE VOTE
OF CONFIDENCE.

27:13.041 --> 27:14.166
Jen: ANDIE,
IT'S NOT A JUDGMENT.

27:14.166 --> 27:17.625
SOME PEOPLE LIKE
SALAD DRESSING
ON THE SALAD,

27:17.625 --> 27:20.041
AND SOME PEOPLE
LIKE IT ON THE SIDE.

27:22.667 --> 27:25.625
OK. WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST

27:25.625 --> 27:27.750
I WANT EVERYONE
THAT I KNOW

27:27.750 --> 27:29.959
TO BE ABLE TO LIVE UP
TO HIS OR HER POTENTIAL.

27:29.959 --> 27:35.166
WELL, I HAVE
GREAT POTENTIAL
AS A WAITRESS.

27:35.166 --> 27:37.625
[LAUGHS]
THAT'S GREAT, JOEY.

27:37.625 --> 27:39.750
WHAT DO YOU SAY
THAT WE GET OUT
OF HERE, ALL RIGHT?

27:39.750 --> 27:41.875
I'VE GOT SOMEBODY
THAT I OWE AN APOLOGY TO.

27:41.875 --> 27:46.417
NO, NO, NO.
STAY HERE.

27:46.417 --> 27:47.917
BEFORE ANYONE
LEAVES THIS SPOT,

27:47.917 --> 27:53.583
WE HAVE A VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION
TO ANSWER.

27:53.583 --> 27:55.500
WHERE DO WE REALLY
SEE OURSELVES
IN 5 YEARS?

27:55.500 --> 27:56.708
AND NOT THE VERSION

27:56.708 --> 27:59.959
THAT YOU ANSWER
TO YOUR COLLEGE
ADVISOR. COME ON.

27:59.959 --> 28:02.417
ALL RIGHT. UM, I PLAN
TO BE STARTING WORK

28:02.417 --> 28:04.959
ON MY MASTER'S THESIS,
"ARE MEN NECESSARY?"

28:04.959 --> 28:05.750
[ALL LAUGH]

28:05.750 --> 28:08.291
AND I GUESS
I'LL BE IN P.R.

28:08.291 --> 28:11.500
'CAUSE I MEAN,
THAT'S ALL I'VE REALLY
EVER BEEN GOOD AT IN LIFE

28:11.500 --> 28:13.542
IS PAINTING A HAPPY FACE
ON DISASTER.

28:13.542 --> 28:14.417
ANDIE.

28:14.417 --> 28:16.834
WELL, YOU KNOW.
THINK ABOUT IT.

28:16.834 --> 28:18.208
[LAUGHS]
OK, YOU'RE UP.

28:18.208 --> 28:22.208
UM...

28:25.792 --> 28:26.834
YOU TELL ME.

28:26.834 --> 28:28.959
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S AN EASY ONE.

28:28.959 --> 28:31.208
UM, YOU WILL
HAVE GRADUATED

28:31.208 --> 28:34.792
FROM A RIDICULOUSLY
EXPENSIVE
IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL,

28:34.792 --> 28:37.625
MOVED TO NEW YORK,
WHERE YOU WILL HAVE
TAKEN A JOB

28:37.625 --> 28:39.708
IN A FUNKY
SOHO ART GALLERY

28:39.708 --> 28:40.708
WHERE
YOUR STARTING SALARY

28:40.708 --> 28:41.625
IS ACTUALLY LESS
THAN A YEAR'S TUITION.

28:41.625 --> 28:47.291
[LAUGHS]
NOW, WHY NEW YORK?

28:47.291 --> 28:51.959
BECAUSE NEW YORK
IS FINISHING SCHOOL
FOR CYNICS LIKE US.

28:51.959 --> 28:53.208
I'M NOT A CYNIC.

28:53.208 --> 28:56.125
[LAUGHS]
OK, YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY

28:56.125 --> 28:57.333
SUNSHINE PERSONIFIED, JOEY.

28:57.333 --> 28:59.542
[LAUGHS]

28:59.542 --> 29:00.542
Andie: OK, OK,
YOU GUYS, COME ON.

29:00.542 --> 29:01.708
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW,
LET'S MAKE A DEAL.

29:01.708 --> 29:04.208
IN 5 YEARS,
WE'LL GET BACK TOGETHER,

29:04.208 --> 29:06.208
AND WE'LL SEE IF ANY
OF THESE PREDICTIONS
ACTUALLY CAME TRUE.

29:06.208 --> 29:07.333
DEAL.

29:07.333 --> 29:10.041
DEAL.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.041
OK.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.917
SHALL WE?

29:12.917 --> 29:14.041
WE SHALL.

29:21.875 --> 29:23.875
OH, WAIT. YOU GUYS,

29:23.875 --> 29:25.417
HOW ARE WE GONNA
REMEMBER THE DATE?

29:25.417 --> 29:27.333
IT'S NOT REALLY
JEN'S BIRTHDAY.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.458
I'LL REMEMBER.

29:28.458 --> 29:29.917
DO YOU PROMISE?

29:29.917 --> 29:32.917
SO, YOU THINK WE'RE
THE ONLY 2 PEOPLE

29:32.917 --> 29:34.250
NOT HAVING FUN
AT THIS THING?

29:34.250 --> 29:36.417
IT'S HARD TO TELL.
EVERYBODY ELSE
COULD BE HAVING FUN,

29:36.417 --> 29:37.333
OR THEY COULD JUST
BE IMITATING THE FUN

29:37.333 --> 29:38.875
THEY'VE SEEN PEOPLE
HAVE IN MOVIES.

29:38.875 --> 29:40.583
[LAUGHS]
YEAH.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.708
SHOULD WE, UH--

29:46.708 --> 29:48.166
NO, THEY'RE GUARDS.
THEY'RE SLOW AS HELL.

29:48.166 --> 29:49.667
THEY'LL NEVER CATCH HIM.

29:49.667 --> 29:50.667
I FORGET YOU ACTUALLY
KNOW THESE PEOPLE.

29:50.667 --> 29:53.375
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S ALL PART

29:53.375 --> 29:54.542
OF BEING ON A TEAM,
I GUESS,

29:54.542 --> 29:57.166
OR SITTING ON THE SIDELINES
AS IT MAY BE.

29:57.166 --> 29:58.125
RIGHT.

29:58.125 --> 29:59.834
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

29:59.834 --> 30:01.750
YOU THINK SOMETHING'S MAKING
YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL,

30:01.750 --> 30:04.500
AND THEN WHEN
IT'S GONE, IT'S...

30:04.500 --> 30:04.917
YOU REALLY MISS IT.

30:11.917 --> 30:16.625
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I GUESS YOU PROBABLY
KNOW THAT FEELING.

30:16.625 --> 30:19.500
[LAUGHS] YEAH.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.083
YEAH.

30:21.083 --> 30:23.625
Drue: EXCELLENT.
I LOVE THIS GIRL.

30:23.625 --> 30:25.000
IT'S LIKE
SHE'S TRYING TO LOSE.

30:31.125 --> 30:32.000
STRIP POKER.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
I LEAVE YOU ALONE
FOR 2 SECONDS,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
AND YOU END UP
PLAYING STRIP POKER?

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
ORIGINALLY THIS WAS
JUST POKER-POKER,

30:39.000 --> 30:40.250
UNTIL I STARTED
KICKING HIS ASS.

30:40.250 --> 30:41.834
THEN YOUR FRIENDLY
NEIGHBORHOOD
CO-WORKER

30:41.834 --> 30:43.667
DECIDES TO CHANGE
THE STAKES ON ME,

30:43.667 --> 30:47.333
BUT I'M FINISHED
NOW, AND, UH,
WE CAN JUST LEAVE.

30:47.333 --> 30:50.792
WHY LEAVE?
THERE'S A HALF-NAKED
CHICK IN THE ROOM.

30:50.792 --> 30:52.625
IT'S JUST A GAME.
UP UNTIL NOW,

30:52.625 --> 30:54.333
NOBODY'S
TAKEN OFF ANYTHING
OTHER THAN SOCKS.

30:54.333 --> 30:57.125
SO, IT'S JUST
ALL GOOD, CLEAN FUN?

30:57.125 --> 31:00.500
YEAH, EXACTLY.
JUST GOOD, CLEAN,
AMERICAN GUY FUN.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.542
MMM.

31:02.542 --> 31:05.333
DEAL ME IN.

31:05.333 --> 31:06.500
EXCUSE ME?

31:06.500 --> 31:08.375
Joey: YOU HEARD ME.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.125
NOW, WHAT DOES A GIRL
HAVE TO TAKE OFF

31:10.125 --> 31:11.250
IN ORDER
TO PLAY THIS GAME?

31:11.250 --> 31:13.417
OK, THAT'S ENOUGH.
[CLAPS]

31:13.417 --> 31:14.834
IT'S TIME FOR US
TO LEAVE NOW,

31:14.834 --> 31:16.000
'CAUSE YOU SEE,
YOU'RE DRUNK,

31:16.000 --> 31:16.834
YOU'RE BORDERING
ON DISORDERLY,

31:16.834 --> 31:18.750
AND YOU ARE
DEFINITELY INSANE.

31:18.750 --> 31:21.125
SO GET UP. LET'S GO.
SHALL WE?

31:21.125 --> 31:25.500
FINISHED? STAND UP.
LET'S GO.

31:25.500 --> 31:26.583
YOU WANT ME
TO STAND UP?

31:26.583 --> 31:30.500
Pacey: YES, I'D LIKE
FOR YOU TO STAND UP NOW.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.291
AND WHY
WOULD I DO THAT?

31:33.291 --> 31:38.792
BECAUSE YOU ARE
FORCING ME TO MAKE
THE ULTIMATE GUY MANEUVER.

31:38.792 --> 31:41.875
PACEY, UH, YOU CAN
PUT ME DOWN NOW, PACEY.
I'M FINE.

31:41.875 --> 31:43.708
Pacey: SHH. SHH.
I'M FINE.

31:49.166 --> 31:52.041
Jen: I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,
BUT THANK YOU.

31:52.041 --> 31:53.792
FOR THE PARTY.

31:53.792 --> 31:56.208
TURNED OUT TO NOT
BE SO HORRIBLE.

31:56.208 --> 31:58.708
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR COMING.

31:58.708 --> 32:01.458
UH, I HOPE
I GOT THE NUMBER
OF CANDLES RIGHT.

32:01.458 --> 32:04.542
[GIGGLES]
IT'LL DO.

32:04.542 --> 32:06.291
SO SHOULD I
MAKE MY WISH?

32:06.291 --> 32:07.708
NO, FIRST
YOUR PRESENT.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.000
I'D HATE FOR YOU
TO SQUANDER IT
ON SOMETHING

32:09.000 --> 32:11.542
THAT MAY ACTUALLY
BE IN THIS BOX.

32:11.542 --> 32:14.542
[SIGHS]

32:14.542 --> 32:17.083
LISTEN.

32:17.083 --> 32:18.250
DRUE, I'M SORRY.

32:18.250 --> 32:20.458
ABOUT
YOUR PARENTS.
JOEY TOLD ME.

32:20.458 --> 32:22.667
AND...

32:22.667 --> 32:24.083
AND I'M SORRY
I--I JUST
ASSUMED

32:24.083 --> 32:24.792
EVERYTHING WOULD
BE THE SAME.

32:24.792 --> 32:26.875
THAT WAS
STUPID OF ME.

32:26.875 --> 32:29.959
IT WAS. WHAT ARE
YOU WAITING FOR?
OPEN YOUR PRESENT.

32:29.959 --> 32:32.000
ALL RIGHT.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.250
BUT YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

32:33.250 --> 32:35.166
I KNOW. I KNOW
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

32:35.166 --> 32:37.458
I WANTED TO.

32:37.458 --> 32:40.083
[BOTH GIGGLE]

32:40.792 --> 32:42.792
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

32:42.792 --> 32:44.500
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

32:47.208 --> 32:48.291
ECSTASY.

32:48.291 --> 32:50.291
DRUE, I THOUGHT
THAT I MADE
MY FEELINGS

32:50.291 --> 32:51.625
PERFECTLY CLEAR
ON THIS SUBJECT.

32:51.625 --> 32:54.834
YOU DID. TOO CLEAR.

32:54.834 --> 32:57.875
WHICH LED ME
TO SUSPECT THE LADY
WAS PROTESTING TOO MUCH.

32:57.875 --> 33:00.625
GOD! I AM
REALLY AN IDIOT.

33:00.625 --> 33:01.750
YOU HAVEN'T
CHANGED A BIT.

33:01.750 --> 33:02.792
OH, AND YOU HAVE?
PLEASE.

33:02.792 --> 33:06.291
YOUR HAIRSTYLE, MAYBE,

33:06.291 --> 33:06.792
BUT PEOPLE DON'T CHANGE.

33:06.792 --> 33:09.125
NOT THAT MUCH.

33:09.125 --> 33:11.083
YES, THEY DO.

33:11.083 --> 33:13.083
THEY GROW UP,
THEY ACCEPT
RESPONSIBILITY.

33:13.083 --> 33:14.458
THEY REALIZE
THAT "DIE YOUNG

33:14.458 --> 33:15.625
AND LEAVE A
GOOD-LOOKING CORPSE"

33:15.625 --> 33:18.041
IS NOT ALL IT'S
CRACKED UP TO BE.

33:18.041 --> 33:18.583
I DON'T WANT
YOUR PRESENT, DRUE.

33:18.583 --> 33:20.375
FINE.

33:20.375 --> 33:23.834
BUT SINCE YOU'VE BECOME SUCH
A PARAGON OF RESPONSIBILITY,

33:23.834 --> 33:24.667
I GUESS
IT WON'T BOTHER YOU

33:24.667 --> 33:28.291
IF I JUST LEAVE IT
RIGHT HERE.

33:28.291 --> 33:30.375
FOR SAFEKEEPING.

33:41.834 --> 33:43.166
HEY.

33:43.166 --> 33:44.500
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE

33:44.500 --> 33:46.375
THAT YOU
GOT HOME OK.

33:46.375 --> 33:47.667
YEAH, I--I
HITCHED A RIDE

33:47.667 --> 33:50.291
WITH MY, UH,
MY ONE GOOD ARM.

33:50.291 --> 33:52.375
OH. I THOUGHT
MAYBE, UH,

33:52.375 --> 33:53.583
DAWSON GAVE YOU
A LIFT.

33:53.583 --> 33:56.166
NOT THAT
I CARE ONE WAY
OR THE OTHER.

33:56.166 --> 33:57.625
I'M NOT
GOING TO GET
TOO INVOLVED

33:57.625 --> 33:58.500
IN YOUR LIFE
OR ANYTHING.

33:58.500 --> 34:01.208
YOU KNOW, THIS
IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

34:01.208 --> 34:04.250
I KNOW. THAT'S
WHY I'M HERE
APOLOGIZING.

34:04.250 --> 34:07.708
I'M NOT, UH, COPYING
THE APOLOGY PART.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.542
I'M SORRY.

34:09.542 --> 34:11.625
I REALLY AM.
I'M SORRY I WASN'T

34:11.625 --> 34:13.041
MORE
UNDERSTANDING
WITH FOOTBALL.

34:13.041 --> 34:15.166
AND I'M REALLY
SORRY THAT I GOT

34:15.166 --> 34:17.291
ALL OVER
YOUR CASE
ON COLLEGE.

34:17.291 --> 34:18.291
KEEP GOING.

34:18.291 --> 34:19.667
YOU WANT ME
TO ABASE MYSELF
FURTHER?

34:19.667 --> 34:22.166
ABASICALLY, YEAH.

34:22.166 --> 34:25.750
OK, JACK, YOU SEEM
TO THINK THAT I AM,

34:25.750 --> 34:28.166
LIKE,
REALLY OBSESSED
WITH THE FUTURE,

34:28.166 --> 34:29.375
AND I'M NOT.

34:29.375 --> 34:30.917
I MEAN, REALLY,
I DON'T WANT IT
TO GET HERE

34:30.917 --> 34:32.083
ANY QUICKER
THAN YOU DO.

34:32.083 --> 34:36.500
YEAH, WELL,
YOU HAVE A FUNNY WAY
OF SHOWING IT.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.917
LOOK, IN LESS
THAN A YEAR,

34:38.917 --> 34:41.375
MY LIFE
IS GOING TO BE
COMPLETELY CHANGED.

34:41.375 --> 34:43.291
I MEAN,
EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE DIFFERENT.

34:43.291 --> 34:44.417
I'M GONNA LIVE
SOMEWHERE DIFFERENT,

34:44.417 --> 34:46.417
I'M GONNA HAVE
DIFFERENT FRIENDS.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.958
I MEAN,
EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO BE DIFFERENT,

34:47.958 --> 34:49.083
AND YOU KNOW
IN TIMES
OF UNCERTAINTY,

34:49.083 --> 34:51.833
I LOOK FOR THINGS
THAT I CAN FIX.

34:51.833 --> 34:54.625
YOU CAN'T FIX ME, ANDIE.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.291
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA LET ME
MAKE MY OWN MISTAKES

34:56.291 --> 34:59.375
IN MY OWN WAY
IN MY OWN TIME.

34:59.375 --> 35:00.542
AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR ME.

35:00.542 --> 35:01.333
I MEAN, YOU GOTTA WORK
ON LETTING GO

35:01.333 --> 35:03.583
OF THINGS
YOU CAN'T CONTROL.

35:03.583 --> 35:05.750
LIKE WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA
GO TO COLLEGE.

35:05.750 --> 35:08.291
OR WHERE
I'M  GONNA
GO TO COLLEGE.

35:08.291 --> 35:09.917
AGREED.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.458
BUT DO YOU REALIZE
THAT NEXT YEAR

35:12.458 --> 35:14.208
IS GONNA BE
THE FIRST YEAR EVER

35:14.208 --> 35:16.250
THAT WE'RE NOT
GONNA BE IN THE SAME
SCHOOL TOGETHER?

35:16.250 --> 35:18.333
[CHUCKLES] HEY.

35:18.333 --> 35:21.792
I TRIED TO START
KINDERGARTEN
WITHOUT YOU.

35:21.792 --> 35:23.250
WHAT?! THAT
IS SUCH A STORY

35:23.250 --> 35:24.959
THAT MOM AND DAD
TOLD YOU.

35:24.959 --> 35:26.166
AND BESIDES,
HOW COULD YOUR
VERSION OF THE STORY

35:26.166 --> 35:28.458
POSSIBLY BE TRUE
WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS

35:28.458 --> 35:32.125
IT'S A FACT
THAT I, THE MORE
RESPONSIBLE ONE,

35:32.125 --> 35:33.250
AM DEFINITELY
THE OLDER SIBLING

35:33.250 --> 35:34.542
IN THIS
RELATIONSHIP.

35:34.542 --> 35:36.917
HEH! YEAH!

35:36.917 --> 35:38.750
ALL RIGHT, YOU.

35:38.750 --> 35:41.458
Joey: I CAN'T
WALK, PACEY.

35:41.458 --> 35:45.000
BEFORE, I HAD
TO DRAG YOU KICKING
AND SCREAMING,

35:45.000 --> 35:47.834
BUT NOW YOU
WANNA BE CARRIED?

35:47.834 --> 35:49.542
NO.

35:52.208 --> 35:54.708
IT'S A WOMAN'S
PREROGATIVE
TO CHANGE HER MIND.

35:54.708 --> 35:55.875
AH, BUT TONIGHT

35:55.875 --> 35:56.708
YOU'RE ONE
OF THE GUYS,
REMEMBER?

35:56.708 --> 35:58.333
AND GUYS WALK.

35:58.333 --> 35:59.125
SO COME ON,
NUMBER 4.

35:59.125 --> 36:02.166
OUT YOU GET,
WATCH YOUR HEAD.

36:03.166 --> 36:05.083
UH...

36:05.083 --> 36:06.208
I DON'T REALLY
FEEL SO GOOD.

36:06.208 --> 36:08.291
WELL, GUESS WHAT?
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL

36:08.291 --> 36:09.250
EVEN WORSE
TOMORROW MORNING.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.458
AND YOU STILL
WON'T BE ANY CLOSER

36:11.458 --> 36:13.375
TO GETTING INTO
THE IVY-COVERED
INSTITUTION

36:13.375 --> 36:13.792
OF YOUR CHOICE.

36:13.792 --> 36:16.333
PACEY.

36:20.917 --> 36:22.875
I'VE BEEN
DOING SOME THINKING.

36:22.875 --> 36:25.166
YEAH.
DRUNK THINKING.

36:28.792 --> 36:31.166
MAYBE...

36:31.166 --> 36:33.667
MAYBE THAT'S NOT
WHAT I REALLY WANT.

36:33.667 --> 36:36.667
MAYBE I JUST
WANNA STAY HERE.

36:38.250 --> 36:40.542
YOU KNOW, I MEAN--

36:40.542 --> 36:44.250
I MEAN, LOOK,
IT'S--IT'S REALLY
BEAUTIFUL HERE AND...

36:44.834 --> 36:45.834
AND I COULD JUST--

36:45.834 --> 36:47.875
JUST WHAT?

36:47.875 --> 36:48.583
STAY HERE AND WORK
AS A WAITRESS

36:48.583 --> 36:49.875
ALL YOUR LIFE?
COME ON.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.208
FORGIVE ME IF YOU'RE
LOSING ME HERE, JO,

36:52.208 --> 36:53.333
BUT TO BE
PERFECTLY HONEST,
YOU HAVEN'T MADE

36:53.333 --> 36:54.667
THE SLIGHTEST BIT
OF SENSE ALL NIGHT,

36:54.667 --> 36:55.875
EVEN BEFORE
YOU WERE DRUNK--

36:55.875 --> 36:56.834
I WANNA BE
WITH YOU, PACEY.

36:56.834 --> 37:00.041
I WANNA STAY
AND BE WITH YOU.

37:00.834 --> 37:01.667
[SIGHS]

37:01.667 --> 37:03.417
HON, IF YOU
WANNA BE WITH ME,

37:03.417 --> 37:06.708
THEN STAYING HERE
WOULD BE A REALLY
STUPID IDEA,

37:06.708 --> 37:09.041
CONSIDERING I DON'T
PLAN TO BE HERE.

37:09.041 --> 37:11.917
I PLAN TO BE
WHEREVER YOU  ARE.

37:16.250 --> 37:17.375
REALLY?

37:17.375 --> 37:18.333
YES, REALLY.

37:20.875 --> 37:23.750
NOT THAT YOU DESERVE
TO HEAR SUCH THINGS
RIGHT NOW.

37:25.542 --> 37:28.166
I KNOW, I KNOW.

37:28.166 --> 37:29.875
IT WAS A VERY
STUPID THING
TO GET DRUNK.

37:29.875 --> 37:32.792
YES, IT WAS.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.667
I MEAN, LET'S
FACE IT HERE, JO.

37:34.667 --> 37:37.041
YOU ARE DESTINED
FOR ACADEMIC GLORY,

37:37.041 --> 37:39.667
AND YOUR BOYFRIEND
IS CIRCLING THE DRAIN,
WHICH IS A PROBLEM.

37:39.667 --> 37:42.583
IN FACT, THAT IS
A VERY BIG PROBLEM,

37:42.583 --> 37:44.083
BUT YOU COULDN'T
POSSIBLY HAVE THOUGHT

37:44.083 --> 37:46.542
THAT YOU COULD SOLVE
ALL OF YOUR PROBLEMS
IN ONE NIGHT,

37:46.542 --> 37:48.500
WITH ALCOHOL
OF ALL THINGS.

37:52.125 --> 37:53.166
NO.

37:53.166 --> 37:54.834
NO.

37:54.834 --> 37:57.166
BECAUSE ALCOHOL, YOU KNOW,
IT HAS THAT EFFECT
ON PROBLEMS.

37:57.166 --> 37:59.375
IT JUST NEVER
SOLVED THEM, EVER.

37:59.375 --> 38:00.333
AND I WOULD
HATE TO THINK

38:00.333 --> 38:02.750
THAT I FELL IN LOVE
WITH A MORON.

38:10.959 --> 38:13.125
SO YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH ME, HUH?

38:13.125 --> 38:14.458
WELL,
NOT CURRENTLY, NO.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.375
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE JUST
SOME CRAZY DRUNK GIRL

38:16.375 --> 38:17.500
I GOTTA GET
IN THAT DOOR

38:17.500 --> 38:19.125
WITHOUT WAKING UP
ALL THE PAYING CUSTOMERS

38:19.125 --> 38:20.625
AT HER SISTER'S B & B,

38:20.625 --> 38:23.750
BUT GENERALLY
SPEAKING...YES.

38:26.250 --> 38:28.125
MAY I KISS YOU
RIGHT NOW?

38:28.125 --> 38:30.291
YES, PLEASE.

38:31.166 --> 38:32.834
MMM!

38:34.750 --> 38:37.625
MMM-MMM-MMM!

38:37.625 --> 38:39.166
MMM-MMM-MMM!

38:39.166 --> 38:41.458
BUT I'M STILL
NOT CARRYING YOU.

38:49.208 --> 38:50.750
[WHISPERING] Please.

38:50.750 --> 38:52.708
NOPE.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.000
[LAUGHS] YOU CAN
GIVE ME THE EYES,

38:56.000 --> 38:57.625
IT'S JUST
NOT GONNA WORK.

38:57.625 --> 39:01.166
OH, COME ON, HONESTLY,
YOU DON'T--[MUMBLING]

39:01.166 --> 39:03.166
JO, WHAT, I LOOK LIKE

39:03.166 --> 39:06.083
I JUST FELL OFF
THE TURNIP TRUCK?

39:06.083 --> 39:09.000
YOU THINK I'M
GONNA FALL FOR THIS?

39:09.000 --> 39:10.291
JO...

39:10.291 --> 39:13.000
HALFWAY,
THAT'S IT, I SWEAR.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.667
I'M NOT KIDDING.
MY BACK'S KILLING ME HERE.

39:18.083 --> 39:20.500
WELL, I GUESS
SINCE YOU'RE UP HERE--

39:27.875 --> 39:30.750
Dawson: OH.

39:30.750 --> 39:31.500
I'M SORRY.
I SAW THE LIGHTS ON.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.500
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE MY MOM.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.667
IT'S OK.
SHE WENT HOME EARLY.

39:35.667 --> 39:37.583
OH, SO, UH...

39:39.708 --> 39:41.041
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE JOB.

39:41.041 --> 39:42.750
THANKS. I FEEL LIKE
I OWE YOU ONE.

39:42.750 --> 39:44.542
OH.

39:55.458 --> 39:57.166
HUH!

39:57.166 --> 39:59.917
CAN I TAKE
A RAIN CHECK?

39:59.917 --> 40:01.583
OH, WE'RE NOT
GONNA DRINK.

40:01.583 --> 40:02.417
BUT FOR
EVERY QUARTER

40:02.417 --> 40:05.041
THAT I BOUNCE
INTO THAT GLASS,

40:05.041 --> 40:07.917
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
ONE THING THAT'S
BOTHERING YOU.

40:07.917 --> 40:10.417
HOW DO YOU KNOW
SOMETHING'S BOTHERING ME?

40:10.417 --> 40:12.208
PLEASE.

40:13.375 --> 40:15.834
[LAUGHING]
OH, THERE!
SEE? PERFECT.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.667
SO SPILL.

40:22.458 --> 40:25.041
ALL RIGHT.

40:25.041 --> 40:28.542
EARLIER THIS EVENING--
AHEM.

40:28.542 --> 40:29.708
MY MOTHER ACCUSED ME
OF WANTING

40:29.708 --> 40:30.792
TO GO TO SCHOOL
IN CALIFORNIA

40:30.792 --> 40:33.375
SO THAT I COULD RUN AWAY
FROM MY PROBLEMS.

40:33.375 --> 40:35.875
AND YOU THINK
SHE'S RIGHT.

40:38.208 --> 40:40.083
I DON'T KNOW.

40:40.083 --> 40:43.458
I MEAN...

40:43.458 --> 40:44.750
PAST FEW WEEKS,
I'VE SEEN PLENTY OF THINGS

40:44.750 --> 40:45.375
THAT WOULD MAKE ME
WANNA RUN SCREAMING

40:45.375 --> 40:47.125
TO THE OPPOSITE COAST.

40:47.125 --> 40:49.291
LIKE?

40:49.291 --> 40:51.041
[QUARTER LANDS IN GLASS]

40:54.041 --> 40:55.750
DON'T MAKE ME
ANSWER THIS.

40:55.750 --> 40:56.917
COME ON.

40:56.917 --> 40:59.291
THIS IS MUCH
MORE THERAPEUTIC
THAN DRINKING.

41:01.083 --> 41:03.041
[SIGHS]

41:04.542 --> 41:07.291
I'VE SEEN HOW MUCH
SHE LOVES HIM.

41:09.333 --> 41:12.291
I'VE SEEN IT
IN HER FACE.

41:12.291 --> 41:15.291
I'VE SEEN THEM HOLD HANDS,
I'VE SEEN THEM KISS,

41:15.291 --> 41:17.083
AND TONIGHT,
I SAW THEM FIGHT,

41:17.083 --> 41:18.208
WHICH IS SOMETHING
I'VE BASICALLY
SEEN THEM DO

41:18.208 --> 41:20.542
EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE
SINCE THE FIRST GRADE, BUT--

41:20.542 --> 41:23.166
BUT NOT LIKE THIS.

41:23.166 --> 41:25.125
[SIGHS]

41:25.125 --> 41:28.250
I THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY
WORSE THAN THE KISSING.

41:36.208 --> 41:37.583
YOU KNOW, DAWSON,

41:37.583 --> 41:39.250
IT MIGHT
INTEREST YOU TO KNOW

41:39.250 --> 41:41.750
THAT I DID TAKE
ONE FILM CLASS
IN COLLEGE.

41:41.750 --> 41:42.500
WAS IT A MONUMENTAL
WASTE OF TIME?

41:42.500 --> 41:45.917
NO. IT WAS
GREAT, ACTUALLY.

41:45.917 --> 41:47.041
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT MY TEACHER SAID

41:47.041 --> 41:49.041
WAS THE
MOST BOGUS LINE
IN HOLLYWOOD CINEMA?

41:49.041 --> 41:51.000
WHAT?

41:51.000 --> 41:52.291
"THERE'S NO PLACE
LIKE HOME."

41:52.291 --> 41:54.000
THE WIZARD OF OZ.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.208
EXACTLY. IT'S WHAT
EVERYBODY REMEMBERS
ABOUT THE MOVIE,

41:57.208 --> 41:58.291
BUT IT
DOESN'T RESONATE

41:58.291 --> 41:59.291
WITH THE REST
OF THE STORY.

41:59.291 --> 42:00.250
THINK ABOUT IT.

42:00.250 --> 42:03.667
YOU KNOW, HOME IS
THIS DESOLATE, GRAY

42:03.667 --> 42:04.834
DUST BOWL
OF A PLACE

42:04.834 --> 42:05.959
WHERE SOME
NASTY OLD LADY

42:05.959 --> 42:07.166
IS TRYING
TO KILL YOUR DOG.

42:07.166 --> 42:08.667
AND OZ IS--

42:08.667 --> 42:09.750
TECHNICOLOR.

42:09.750 --> 42:11.083
AND SURE IT HAS
ITS PROBLEMS.

42:11.083 --> 42:13.041
YOU KNOW,
POPPY FIELDS,
FLYING MONKEYS--

42:13.041 --> 42:14.834
TALKING TREES.

42:14.834 --> 42:17.583
BUT ALONG THE WAY,
YOU MAKE FRIENDS.

42:17.583 --> 42:19.041
GOOD FRIENDS.

42:19.041 --> 42:21.125
WITH PEOPLE
THAT YOU NEVER
EVEN KNEW EXISTED

42:21.125 --> 42:22.458
WHEN YOU WERE
GROWING UP.

42:22.458 --> 42:25.166
STRAW PEOPLE,
TIN PEOPLE--

42:25.166 --> 42:26.166
AND LIONS.

42:26.166 --> 42:27.875
EXACTLY.

42:27.875 --> 42:29.375
AND YOU HELP
EACH OTHER REALIZE

42:29.375 --> 42:31.333
THAT ALL THE THINGS
YOU WANNA BE

42:31.333 --> 42:33.542
YOU ALREADY ARE.

42:35.917 --> 42:37.417
AND IT'S FUN.

42:38.542 --> 42:42.792
WELL, IF IT'S
SO MUCH FUN...

42:42.792 --> 42:44.959
THEN WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

42:44.959 --> 42:47.375
I DON'T RECALL
YOU GETTING TO
ASK ANY QUESTIONS

42:47.375 --> 42:49.542
AS PART OF OUR DEAL.

42:49.542 --> 42:52.625
WELL, WHAT IF I CAN
BOUNCE A QUARTER
IN THAT GLASS?

42:52.625 --> 42:53.875
NEVER HAPPEN.

42:53.875 --> 42:55.041
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GONNA LET ME TRY?

42:55.041 --> 42:56.333
YOU CAN TRY,

42:56.333 --> 42:59.583
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO USE YOUR OWN
MONEY,

42:59.583 --> 43:00.708
BECAUSE I WORKED
VERY HARD TO EARN
THESE QUARTERS.

43:00.708 --> 43:02.667
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LOAN ME
ONE LOUSY QUARTER?

43:02.667 --> 43:05.375
NO.
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S FAIR.

43:05.375 --> 43:06.708
[LAUGHS] WELL,
THAT'S TOO BAD.
