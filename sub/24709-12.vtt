WEBVTT

00:19.102 --> 00:20.729
[SIREN WHOOPS]

00:25.275 --> 00:27.485
WE'LL CHECK THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE STREET.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.363
WHAT'S THE STORY?

00:30.613 --> 00:33.158
THIS GUY'S WALKING
BY THE TRASH HEAP,

00:33.283 --> 00:34.242
SEES THE BOX.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.286
LIKES THE WORKMANSHIP,
HE WANTS TO TAKE IT,

00:36.411 --> 00:37.579
BUT IT'S TOO HEAVY.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.664
THEN HE SEES
THE LIQUID COMING
OUT OF THE BOTTOM,

00:39.831 --> 00:41.624
NOTICES
THAT PUTRID SMELL.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.419
CALLS US,
WE PRY IT OPEN,
THIS IS WHAT WE FIND.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.795
NO I.D. ON HER.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.255
GOOD-LOOKING LADY.

00:47.338 --> 00:48.381
FORMERLY.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.340
WHAT'S THIS GUY'S NAME?

00:49.466 --> 00:50.508
ED PETERSON.

00:52.886 --> 00:53.928
MR. PETERSON,

00:54.012 --> 00:55.013
I'M DETECTIVE SIMONE,

00:55.138 --> 00:56.222
THIS IS
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.724
THIS IS THE MOST
UNBELIEVABLE THING

00:57.807 --> 00:58.683
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED
TO ME.

00:58.767 --> 00:59.768
TELL US
ABOUT IT.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.311
I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.188
I HAVE NO CONNECTION
TO THE BOX.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.314
YOU WERE JUST
WALKING BY?

01:04.439 --> 01:05.732
I WAS A PASSERBY, YEAH.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.484
I SAW THE BOX,
I ADMIRED IT.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.403
I THOUGHT I COULD USE IT
FOR STORAGE OR MAKE
SHELVES, YOU KNOW?

01:10.487 --> 01:12.030
SURE.
UH...WHO KNOWS?

01:12.155 --> 01:14.324
IT SEEMED
LIKE FREE GAME,
BEING BY THE TRASH.

01:14.407 --> 01:15.909
I WASN'T STEALING
I DIDN'T THINK.

01:15.992 --> 01:16.993
NOBODY SAID THAT.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.870
I WAS PICKING IT UP,
AND, UH,

01:18.953 --> 01:20.914
I NOTED THIS LIQUID
OOZING OUT.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.917
MY INSTINCT
WAS FOUL PLAY,
AND I REPORTED IT.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.251
YOU LIVE IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

01:25.376 --> 01:27.545
I WORK AT THIS PIANO RENTAL
STORE DOWN THE BLOCK.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.214
I SWEAR THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.590
OK, DON'T GET
SO WORKED UP.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.760
THERE'S, UH,
2 GUYS WITH DIANE
WE SHOULD TALK TO.

01:33.843 --> 01:34.886
THANKS.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.847
NOW I WISH I NEVER
SAW THAT DAMN BOX.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.731
CLYDE JONES, MARCO ARNEZ.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.650
TELL THEM WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.194
WE WORK AT THIS BUILDING.
MONDAY'S TRASH DAY.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.947
LAST WEEK SOMEONE PUT THAT BOX
OUT THERE FOR DUMPING.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.406
THAT'S A NICE BOX.
GOOD WOOD.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.866
AND IT'S MADE REALLY GOOD.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.952
SO WE TOOK IT TO THE BASEMENT,
FIGURED WE'D GET IT LATER.

01:59.035 --> 01:59.994
AND DID YOU?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.454
WE CAME BACK THE END
OF THE WEEK,

02:01.538 --> 02:03.581
BUT YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW HEAVY THE THING WAS.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.583
STUNK, TOO. WE JUST PUT IT
BACK OUT FOR TRASH.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.377
THAT WAS...LAST FRIDAY.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.045
IT'S BEEN SITTING OUT THERE
EVER SINCE.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.588
YOU DIDN'T WONDER
WHY IT STUNK?

02:10.713 --> 02:12.090
NOT REALLY.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.176
THANKS FOR COOPERATING.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.722
WHICH ONE WAS GONNA
GET THE BOX,

02:19.889 --> 02:21.015
BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU?

02:22.892 --> 02:26.312
Clyde: I GUESS EVENTUALLY
THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
A BONE OF CONTENTION.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.654
WOMAN STRANGLED
AND BLUDGEONED,

03:57.737 --> 03:59.822
BOARDED-UP IN
THIS HOMEMADE BOX.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.742
NO LESS THAN 10 PEOPLE
WANTED TO MAKE OFF
WITH THAT THING,

04:02.825 --> 04:04.744
THE HANDIWORK MADE
SUCH AN IMPRESSION.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.913
TOOK A WEEK FOR ANYBODY
TO REPORT IT.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.248
NO I.D.?

04:08.331 --> 04:09.916
Simone: SHE'S GOT THESE
NICE DESIGNER CLOTHES ON,

04:09.999 --> 04:12.252
AND ALL THE LABELS
WERE FROM GOOD WILL,
SO WE'RE GONNA GO OVER THERE

04:12.335 --> 04:14.254
AND SEE IF
WE CAN GET HER NAME
OFF SOME OF THE RECEIPTS.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.755
YOU CHECKED WITH
MISSING PERSONS?

04:15.838 --> 04:17.465
YEAH. NOBODY FITS
HER DESCRIPTION.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.385
HEY, ANDY, I THOUGHT
OF A FITTING NAME
FOR YOUR CASE.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.595
FOX IN A BOX.

04:22.679 --> 04:23.763
CATCHY.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.771
DIANE.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.649
YOU'VE GOT AN INVESTIGATE-AIDED
AT BELLEVUE:

04:34.732 --> 04:36.943
6-YEAR-OLD BOY,
SERIOUSLY INJURED.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.111
OK.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.320
YOU UP TO IT?

04:39.529 --> 04:40.905
SURE. I JUST...
NEED A MINUTE.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.532
OK.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.768
MORNING.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.812
Kirkendall:
MORNING. WHAT DO WE GOT?

05:12.895 --> 05:13.771
RICKY POWELL,
DISPATCHER.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.273
CAUGHT ONE
IN THE CHEST.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.607
THESE GUYS
WERE WITNESSES.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.526
THEY'RE DRIVERS
WORKING THE SHIFT.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.948
THAT LOOK LIKE
THE PERP GOT HIT?

05:24.198 --> 05:25.283
AH, GOOD POSSIBILITY.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.534
MORNING.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.287
HOW YOU DOIN'?

05:29.370 --> 05:31.414
I'M BUGGIN' OUT,
YOU KNOW?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.624
Medavoy:
CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

05:33.708 --> 05:35.793
UM, MAN, BUSINESS IS SLOW.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.128
RICKY'S TAKING A TURN
AT PINBALL,

05:37.378 --> 05:39.130
AND THIS PUERTO RICAN DUDE
COMES IN.

05:39.213 --> 05:40.965
HE'S ALL PISSED OFF,
SHOUTING AND EVERYTHING.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.425
YEAH, AND DRUNK.
STINKING DRUNK.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.093
YEAH, AND HE'S TALKING
ABOUT HOW HE WANTS A CAR,

05:44.385 --> 05:46.054
SO RICKY SAYS,
"GIVE ME A MINUTE,"
YOU KNOW?

05:46.304 --> 05:47.347
"I'M FINISHING MY GAME."

05:47.430 --> 05:48.431
YEAH, HE WAS ONLY
ON HIS FIRST BALL.

05:48.514 --> 05:49.849
YEAH, HE DIDN'T
WANT TO WASTE IT.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.352
BUT THE DUDE'S INSISTING,
SO FINALLY HE GOTTA
GIVE IT UP.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.187
AND THEN RICKY TOLD
THE PUERTO RICAN DUDE,

05:54.270 --> 05:56.647
"YOU GOTTA SHOW ME THE MONEY
BEFORE I GIVE YOU THE CAR."

05:56.939 --> 05:58.983
AND THAT'S WHEN MY MAN
PULLS OUT THE GUN.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.860
I SAW THAT,
I HIT THE DECK.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.695
YEAH, WE...
WE GOT INTO THE BOOTH,

06:03.029 --> 06:04.447
COVERED OURSELVES,
YOU KNOW?

06:04.572 --> 06:06.908
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
BLAU! BLAU!

06:06.991 --> 06:08.034
DUDE SHOOTS RICKY.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.243
THEN WE COME OUT.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.496
RICKY'S DEAD,
AND WE CAN'T HELP HIM.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.623
CAN YOU, UH, DESCRIBE
THE SHOOTER ANY MORE?

06:13.915 --> 06:16.918
MAYBE 30. SHORT HAIR.
HE HAD A BLUE FLANNEL SHIRT.

06:17.001 --> 06:20.046
AND AN EARRING.
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THEM
BLACK-AND-WHITE SYMBOLS.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.422
WHAT? YIN-YANG?

06:21.506 --> 06:22.882
YEAH, THAT.

06:22.965 --> 06:26.177
ANY CHANCE RICKY
PULLED A GUN, TOO.
SHOT AT THIS GUY?

06:26.260 --> 06:28.888
NAH. RICKY'S MAMA
WOULDN'T LET HIM
HAVE NO GUN.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.891
I CALLED HER,
TOLD HER.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.726
YOU SHOULD'VE
LEFT THAT TO US.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.395
SHE GONNA HAVE
A REAL BAD TIME, MAN,

06:35.478 --> 06:36.896
'CAUSE RICKY STILL
LIVED WITH HER.

06:36.979 --> 06:40.108
I DON'T THINK HE WAS EVER
PLANNING ON MOVING EITHER.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.860
OK. WE MAY BE
BACK IN TOUCH.

06:48.866 --> 06:50.576
HEY.
YEAH?

06:50.660 --> 06:53.788
MAYBE THE BLOOD TRAIL
IS RICKY'S.

06:53.871 --> 06:56.290
YOU KNOW, TRIED TO
FOLLOW THE GUY OUT

06:56.374 --> 06:57.792
BEFORE COMING BACK
AND KEELING OVER.

06:57.875 --> 06:58.793
MAYBE.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.836
MILLER.

07:00.002 --> 07:00.878
YEAH.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.505
NOTIFY CRIME SCENE.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.757
GET THESE 2 GUYS OUTTA HERE
AND GET THEIR INFORMATION.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.592
OK. WILL DO.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.266
EXCUSE ME, SWEETIE.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.934
I HAVE TO TALK
TO A DETECTIVE.

07:15.017 --> 07:16.018
DETECTIVE SIMONE.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.606
HEY.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.275
I'M TIM JONES.

07:22.358 --> 07:25.069
I NEED TO REPORT
MY DEAREST FRIEND IN
THE WHOLE WORLD MISSING.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.074
HAVE A SEAT.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.292
HER NAME IS,
UH, WENDY SHATZI.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.127
SHE'S A PURE ANGEL,

07:41.210 --> 07:44.088
AND I THINK
SOMETHING HORRIBLE
HAS HAPPENED TO HER.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.298
WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK THAT?

07:45.381 --> 07:47.300
SHE'S ON A VERY
REGULAR SCHEDULE.

07:47.383 --> 07:51.137
START OF THE WEEK, SHE TAKES
CARE OF HER ELDERLY INVALID
MOTHER HERE IN NEW YORK.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.640
ON WEDNESDAYS, SHE GOES
TO FLORIDA, TAKES CARE OF
HER ELDERLY INVALID AUNT.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.642
COMES BACK SATURDAY.
SAME EVERY WEEK.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.227
AND THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE
IN THOSE PATTERNS?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.354
I'VE HEARD NOTHING FOR A WEEK.
WE TALK EVERY DAY.

08:00.438 --> 08:01.564
COULD SHE HAVE STAYED
IN FLORIDA

08:01.647 --> 08:03.232
A LITTLE BIT LONGER
THAN USUAL THIS TIME?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.567
SHE CALLS FROM FLORIDA.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.194
WE TALK EVERY DAY.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.237
WELL, THE THING IS, TIM,

08:08.321 --> 08:10.490
WE CAN'T TAKE
MISSING-PERSON REPORTS

08:10.573 --> 08:12.074
FROM PEOPLE WHO AREN'T
FAMILY MEMBERS.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.743
OHH, DEAR.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.162
WHERE'S WENDY
BUY HER CLOTHES?

08:16.245 --> 08:18.039
HOW'S THAT APPLY?

08:18.122 --> 08:19.624
IT'S JUST A QUESTION.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.584
SHE'S A THRIFT SHOPPER.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.835
SECONDHAND, YOU KNOW?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.337
LIKE THE GOODWILL?

08:24.420 --> 08:26.380
YEAH.

08:26.464 --> 08:30.760
TIM, WOULD YOU BE
WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK
AT A PICTURE FOR US?

08:30.843 --> 08:32.386
OF WHAT?

08:32.470 --> 08:37.350
WE'RE, UH, WORKING
ON A CASE RIGHT NOW
OF AN UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.351
DEAD?

08:38.434 --> 08:40.728
YEAH, SHE WAS FOUND DEAD.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.355
OH, IT'S WENDY,
I KNOW IT.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.981
COULD YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS PHOTO?

08:44.065 --> 08:45.399
OH, NO,
IT'S TOO TERRIBLE.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.776
IT'S GONNA BE HER,
I KNOW.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.194
TIM, IT WOULD
REALLY HELP US--

08:48.277 --> 08:50.363
NO, I CAN'T, I CAN'T.
IT'S GONNA BE HER,
I KNOW IT.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.989
TAKE A LOOK
AT THE PHOTO, TIM.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.242
JUST LOOK
AT THE PICTURE.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.712
[GASPS]

09:06.796 --> 09:10.049
OH, DAMN IT.
[SOBBING]

09:10.132 --> 09:11.133
IS THAT WENDY?

09:11.217 --> 09:13.803
WHY DID YOU MAKE ME
LOOK AT IT?

09:13.886 --> 09:16.180
I TOLD YOU
IT WAS GONNA BE HER.

09:16.264 --> 09:20.393
ANY IDEAS WHO'D DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
TO HER?

09:20.476 --> 09:22.228
YOU BET I DO.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.522
HER BROTHER.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.148
HER BEADY-EYED
BROTHER WILLY.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.400
THANK YOU.

09:27.483 --> 09:28.901
[SOBBING]

09:28.985 --> 09:31.362
WENDY AND HIM
FOUGHT ALL THE TIME.

09:31.445 --> 09:32.446
[SOBBING]

09:32.530 --> 09:33.531
ABOUT WHAT?

09:34.657 --> 09:36.242
MONEY.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.827
WENDY'S RICH.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.078
SHE HAS A TRUST FUND,

09:39.161 --> 09:41.747
PLUS WHAT SHE MADE
AS AN ACTRESS.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.749
SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE
ACTRESS.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.970
WHAT DOES THIS WILLY
DO FOR A LIVING?

09:57.346 --> 09:58.431
TIM.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.934
NOTHING.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.438
SO YOU THINK HE'D BE
WILLING TO PITCH IN
CARING FOR THE MOTHER,

10:05.521 --> 10:08.774
BUT, NO, HE'S NO HELP.

10:08.858 --> 10:13.279
HE JUST SPENDS FROM THE TRUST
AND DOES SQUAT WITH HIS LIFE.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.239
DID HE AND WENDY
HAVE A RECENT FLARE-UP?

10:17.366 --> 10:19.035
AUNT FRIEDA IN FLORIDA--

10:19.118 --> 10:23.164
LAST WEEK SHE GIVES
THE MAN WHO DOES HER HAIR
AN ORIGINAL PICASSO SKETCH.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.291
AS A TOKEN OF APPRECIATION,
YOU KNOW?

10:25.374 --> 10:27.627
ONLY IT'S A FAMILY TREASURE.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.503
IN HER RIGHT MIND,
SHE'D NEVER PART WITH IT.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.465
SO THE HAIRDRESSER
CALLS WENDY AND TELLS HER.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.800
THANK GOD HE'S HONEST.
HE GIVES IT BACK.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.053
MY POINT IS,
FRIEDA'S LOSING HER WITS.

10:37.136 --> 10:40.806
SO WENDY CALLS HER
AND TALKS TO HER
ABOUT IT VERY FRANKLY.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.976
AND GOD LOVE THE OLD GIRL,
SHE SAYS TO WENDY,

10:44.060 --> 10:47.146
"I BETTER PUT YOU IN CHARGE,
OTHERWISE I MIGHT GIVE AWAY
THE WHOLE STORE."

10:47.229 --> 10:48.773
SHE WAS GONNA GIVE
WENDY POWER OF ATTORNEY.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.692
AND THE FIRST THING
SHE WAS GONNA DO
WAS CUT WILLY OFF.

10:51.776 --> 10:52.818
YOU KNOW WHERE HE LIVES?

10:52.902 --> 10:54.987
WITH THE INVALID MOTHER.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.989
2 FLOORS UP FROM WENDY.

10:57.073 --> 11:00.201
I KNOW HE DID THIS TO HER!

11:00.284 --> 11:01.702
OK, TIM.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.039
YOU WANT A GLASS
OF WATER?

11:06.374 --> 11:08.292
NO.

11:08.376 --> 11:12.213
I JUST NEED A MINUTE
TO REASSEMBLE MYSELF.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.236
EXCUSE ME. YOU HAVE
A 6-YEAR-OLD BOY HERE?

11:36.570 --> 11:37.988
I'M DR. SHANE.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.156
DETECTIVE RUSSELL.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.825
THE BOY'S NAME
IS JOSH WALKER.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.243
WE JUST PRONOUNCED HIM
10 MINUTES AGO.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.244
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:43.327 --> 11:44.954
BROKE HIS NECK
IN A FALL.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.832
I COULD BE WRONG,
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
A HISTORY OF ABUSE THERE.

11:47.915 --> 11:48.958
OHH. SEXUAL?

11:49.041 --> 11:51.001
NO. M.E.'d BE ABLE
TO TELL YOU BETTER,

11:51.085 --> 11:52.211
BUT I THINK IT'S
WORTH LOOKING INTO.

11:52.294 --> 11:53.713
ARE THE PARENTS HERE?

11:53.796 --> 11:55.423
LINDA WALKER'S
THE MOTHER.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.675
STEPDAD'S HERE, TOO.

11:57.758 --> 11:58.843
THANKS.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.724
EXCUSE ME.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.934
I'M DETECTIVE RUSSELL.

12:07.017 --> 12:10.604
I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU AND YOUR WIFE
ABOUT JOSH'S DEATH.

12:20.698 --> 12:21.782
HE, UH...

12:21.866 --> 12:23.784
HE TUMBLED
DOWN THE STAIRS.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.619
BACK OF OUR BUILDING.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.456
HE, UH, HIT HIS HEAD
FLAT ON THE PAVEMENT.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.874
HE WAS
A KLUTZY KID.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.041
DID YOU SEE IT,
LINDA?

12:31.125 --> 12:32.126
WHAT?

12:32.209 --> 12:33.127
JOSH FALLING.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.463
NO, I WAS INSIDE.

12:35.546 --> 12:36.714
Stepfather:
I SAW IT.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.090
IT WAS A HELLUVA FALL.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.925
YOU WERE THERE
WITH JOSH.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.802
YEAH. I WAS TRYING TO
GET HIM TO GO OUTSIDE.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.472
THE KID NEEDS FRESH AIR
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

12:44.555 --> 12:45.806
WAS HE GOING
WILLINGLY?

12:45.890 --> 12:47.975
WELL, HE DON'T DO
NOTHIN' WILLINGLY.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.352
HE WAS MOANIN' AND GROANIN'
IT WAS COLD.

12:50.436 --> 12:54.440
THAT'S WHEN HE STUMBLED,
AND HE TOOK THE DIVE.

12:54.523 --> 12:55.357
WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
SIR?

12:55.441 --> 12:57.651
GARY WALKER.
I'M HER HUSBAND.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.780
MR. WALKER, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ASK YOU AND
YOUR WIFE TO COME DOWN

13:00.863 --> 13:02.782
TO THE STATION HOUSE,
TALK SOME MORE
ABOUT THIS.

13:02.865 --> 13:06.118
I CAN'T DO IT. I'M ALREADY
LOSING ENOUGH TIME AS IT IS
JUST BEING HERE.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.745
JOSH IS DEAD.
YOU CAN MISS WORK.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.789
I'M LOSING HOURS, TOO.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.457
DON'T TAKE A TONE WITH ME.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.751
GARY, YOUR WIFE'S
BEEN THROUGH
A TRAGEDY HERE.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.127
YEAH. ME, TOO.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.462
WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD?

13:16.545 --> 13:18.339
YOU WANT A MINUTE
WITH YOUR SON, LINDA?

13:19.840 --> 13:22.218
YES. PLEASE.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.706
DO YOU LIKE
THIS FRUIT TIM?

13:52.790 --> 13:55.251
HE WAS QUICK
POINTING TO THE BROTHER.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.502
[CLEARING THROAT]

13:56.585 --> 13:58.170
YOU WONDER WHAT'S
IN WENDY'S WILL FOR HIM.

13:58.254 --> 13:59.296
MMM.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.381

14:04.385 --> 14:05.469
[LATCH TURNS]

14:05.553 --> 14:06.470

14:06.554 --> 14:08.305

14:08.389 --> 14:09.807
I'M DETECTIVE SIMONE,
THIS IS DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.
CAN WE COME IN, PLEASE?

14:09.890 --> 14:11.350
NO.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.227
MY MOTHER'S ILL.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.896
WOULD YOU TAKE THE CHAIN
OFF THE DOOR SO WE CAN
TALK TO YOU, PLEASE?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.398
[SULLEN]
OK.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.946
WE'RE LOOKING
INTO THE WHEREABOUTS
OF YOUR SISTER WENDY.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.823
SHE'S IN FLORIDA.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.825
WE HEARD SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE BACK LAST WEEK.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.994
NO, SHE'S LOOKING AFTER
MY AUNT IN FLORIDA.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.954
I JUST SPOKE WITH HER
THIS MORNING.

14:33.581 --> 14:36.292
WELL, WE'D REALLY
LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
SOME MORE, MR. SHATZI.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.585
CAN WE COME IN
AND SIT DOWN?

14:37.668 --> 14:38.586
NO.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.004
MM-HMM.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.172
THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
YOU DOWN TO THE STATION HOUSE.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.924
ALL RIGHT.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.227
YOU DON'T NEED ANYBODY
TO SIT WITH YOUR MOM?

14:55.311 --> 14:57.855
OH, SHE'S ASLEEP.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.168
HEY, JILL.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.377
YEAH?

15:20.461 --> 15:21.962
A GUY MATCHING
YOUR PERP'S
DESCRIPTION

15:22.046 --> 15:24.048
CAME INTO BELLEVUE
WITH A BULLET WOUND.

15:24.131 --> 15:25.841
A RICO PEREZ.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.676
MAYBE HE'S A GROUNDER.

15:37.686 --> 15:38.938
WHO'S THIS?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.439
BROTHER OF OUR DOA.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.358
CLAIMS HE SPOKE WITH HER
THIS MORNING.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.735
WE'RE GONNA TRY GET
A SEARCH WARRANT
FOR HIS APARTMENT.

15:44.818 --> 15:46.278
HE WOULDN'T
LET US IN.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.281
Lt. Fancy: OK. HARD
TO BELIEVE HE LIVES
IN NEW YORK.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.991
MORE LIKE HE SHOULD BE
IN A PAINTING, RIGHT?

15:51.075 --> 15:53.160
THE GUY WITH THE PITCHFORK
AND HIS WIFE.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.129
HAVE A SEAT.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.255
OH. OK.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.516
CAN I HAVE A COKE?

16:15.599 --> 16:17.184
IN A FEW MINUTES.

16:17.267 --> 16:20.145
THERE'S BAD NEWS,
WILLY.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.480
WHAT'S THAT?

16:21.563 --> 16:23.607
YOUR SISTER WENDY
IS DEAD.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.777
DEAD? NO.
SHE'S IN FLORIDA.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.871
AW, JIMINY.

16:40.457 --> 16:43.544
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT HER BEING
IN THIS BOX?

16:44.795 --> 16:46.130
NOTHING.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.507
YOU SAID
YOU SPOKE TO HER
JUST THIS MORNING.

16:48.590 --> 16:52.678
YEAH. I, UH,
MUST HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN.

16:52.761 --> 16:53.971
HOW LONG HAS SHE
BEEN MISSING, WILLY?

16:54.054 --> 16:56.682
WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY.

16:56.765 --> 16:59.560
SHE GOES TO FLORIDA
SO MUCH.

16:59.643 --> 17:03.522
I FIGURE, SHE'S NOT HERE,
SHE MUST BE THERE.

17:03.605 --> 17:06.233
YOU KNOW, SHE'S AN ACTRESS,

17:06.316 --> 17:09.194
AND HER SCHEDULE
IS VERY HAPHAZARD.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.245
I'D LIKE A MOMENT
TO MYSELF.

17:18.328 --> 17:21.415
YEAH, SURE. WE'LL STEP OUT
FOR A MINUTE.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.666
THANK YOU.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.918
WE'LL HAVE SOMEONE COME IN
AND BRING YOU A SODA.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.260
BE RIGHT
WITH YOU.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.349
WHAT'S THIS?

17:39.433 --> 17:42.728
PARENTS OF A KID
WHO DIED IN A FALL.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.438
YOU WENT ON IT ALONE?

17:44.521 --> 17:47.066
TO BELLEVUE. WASN'T
EXACTLY DANGEROUS.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.902
NO. JUST SAYING.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.529
I GO TO THE BATHROOM
BY MYSELF, TOO, BOBBY.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.577
LINDA, WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH ME.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.246
WHAT AM I DOING?

18:01.330 --> 18:02.206
JUST SIT TIGHT.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.249
I DON'T THINK SO.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.752
GARY, YOU SIT
AND WAIT,

18:06.835 --> 18:08.462
OR I'LL HAVE
ONE OF THESE GUYS
PUT YOU IN A ROOM.

18:08.545 --> 18:09.671
YOUR CHOICE.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.177
UNBELIEVABLE.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.014
COME ON.

18:22.309 --> 18:25.020
WHAT KIND OF HITLERS
YOU GOT WORKING HERE?

18:28.398 --> 18:29.650
IN HERE.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.652
WHY CAN'T GARY COME?
I DON'T MIND.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.612
I GOTTA TALK TO YOU
SEPARATELY.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.781
IT'S STANDARD
PROCEDURE.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.366
HERE YOU GO.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.162
I DIDN'T SAY SO
AT THE HOSPITAL,
LINDA.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.455
I'M SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.040
THANKS.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.254
SO, WHAT'S YOUR WORK?

18:50.337 --> 18:51.839
BARTENDER.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.424
I CAN'T STAY
MUCH LONGER, THOUGH.

18:54.508 --> 18:55.926
DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT--

18:56.009 --> 18:58.470
BEING PREGNANT
AND SERVING BOOZE.

18:58.554 --> 18:59.847
THIS IS GARY'S BABY?

18:59.930 --> 19:00.931
YEAH.

19:02.724 --> 19:05.144
DO YOU BELIEVE
WHAT HE SAID, LINDA,

19:05.227 --> 19:07.437
THAT JOSH FELL DOWN
THOSE STAIRS?

19:07.521 --> 19:08.605
SURE.

19:08.689 --> 19:09.940
OR DO YOU THINK
HE MIGHT HAVE HIT HIM

19:10.023 --> 19:11.775
AND KNOCKED HIM
DOWN THE STEPS?

19:11.859 --> 19:13.318
HE IS A HITTER.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.988
I WASN'T A WITNESS, BUT..

19:16.071 --> 19:18.157
YOUR SCENARIO
WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.409
SO HE'D HIT JOSH
BEFORE.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.660
OH, YEAH.

19:21.743 --> 19:22.703
AND YOU, TOO?

19:22.786 --> 19:24.454
I'VE BEEN HIT
ALL MY LIFE.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.331
I DON'T HAVE
A VICTIMY THING ABOUT IT.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.042
BUT I GOTTA SAY,

19:29.126 --> 19:31.879
JOSH WASN'T
NO BUNDLE OF JOY.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.046
NO, HUH?

19:33.130 --> 19:34.464
CRIED ALL THE TIME.

19:34.548 --> 19:38.343
WOKE US UP CRYING
ABOUT MONSTERS
IN HIS NIGHTMARES.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.095
WIPED HIS BOOGERS
ON THE SOFA.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.681
HE JUST COULDN'T
BE RIGHT.

19:42.764 --> 19:43.765
[SIGH]

19:43.849 --> 19:45.184
SCHOOL KIDS
NEVER LIKED HIM.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.352
NEITHER DID THE TEACHER.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.855
HE WAS JUST...

19:49.938 --> 19:51.315
LIKE, A MISFIT.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.193
DID YOU
HIT JOSH, TOO?

19:54.276 --> 19:55.861
NO.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.032
AND YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND,
GARY DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.700
HE'D BE ROUGH WITH JOSH,

20:01.783 --> 20:04.620
BUT JOSH...
DIDN'T SEEM TO LEARN.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.788
PLUS HE'D MAKE UP FOR IT--
BUY HIM A TOY THE NEXT DAY,

20:06.872 --> 20:09.249
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.001
I'M GONNA ASK YOU
AGAIN, LINDA.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.337
DID YOU SEE JOSH
GO DOWN THE STAIRS?

20:13.420 --> 20:14.671
NO.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.465
DID GARY TELL YOU
HE PUSHED HIM?

20:16.548 --> 20:18.258
NO...

20:18.342 --> 20:20.928
BUT HE LIES.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.184
OK. I'M GONNA
TALK TO HIM.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.478
WHY DON'T I GET YOU
A RIDE HOME.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.205
HOW'S JAMES DOING,
ANYWAY?

20:48.288 --> 20:50.207
OH, HIS BACK'S
IN BAD SHAPE, I GUESS.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.250
FIRST BED.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.876
HE AND GINA DOING
BED REST TOGETHER?

20:52.960 --> 20:54.836
YEAH. WONDERING WHO'S
GONNA CRACK UP FIRST.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.714
RICO PEREZ?

20:59.341 --> 21:00.384
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

21:00.467 --> 21:02.844
DETECTIVE MEDAVOY
AND KIRKENDALL.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.263
WE HEARD YOU GOT SHOT.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.848
UH-HUH, RIGHT
IN MY HIP.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.433
HOW'D IT HAPPEN?

21:08.517 --> 21:09.935
SOME BUDDY OF MINE.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.771
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I AIN'T CHARGING HIM.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.314
CHARGING'S WHAT
WE DO, RICO.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.774
WHAT'S
YOUR FRIEND'S NAME?

21:15.857 --> 21:18.110
I DON'T KNOW.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.404
ARE YOU INTOXICATED?

21:20.487 --> 21:22.614
LOOK, I AIN'T TALKING
TO YOU NO MORE, OK?

21:22.698 --> 21:24.449
I KNOW IT JUST
PUTS YOU IN JAIL.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.910
WHY WOULD WE ARREST YOU
FOR GETTING SHOT?

21:26.994 --> 21:29.663
HA HA. YOU'D COME UP
WITH SOMETHING.

21:29.746 --> 21:32.249
WERE YOU AT
AVENUE CAR SERVICE
THIS MORNING, RICO?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.376
NO.

21:34.459 --> 21:35.794
'CAUSE YOU MATCH
THE DESCRIPTION
OF A GUY

21:35.877 --> 21:36.962
WHO PULLED
A SHOOTING THERE.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.213
WASN'T ME.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.590
THE DISPATCHER
WAS KILLED.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.342
NOW, IF YOU HAD
A PART IN THAT,

21:42.426 --> 21:44.261
YOU WANNA SAY SO
UP FRONT.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.805
NO. NO, UH-UH.

21:46.888 --> 21:48.724
I KNOW HOW YOU TRICK PEOPLE
INTO SAYING STUFF,

21:48.807 --> 21:50.142
AND THEN YOU LOCK THEM UP.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.810
I AIN'T TAKING
ANY CHANCES.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.396
WHERE'S THE GUN THAT
GOES WITH THIS HOLSTER?

21:56.398 --> 21:57.733
IS THAT THE GUN
YOU GOT SHOT WITH?

22:03.071 --> 22:04.156
WHAT'S THE DOC SAY?

22:04.239 --> 22:05.532
THEY ADMITTING

22:05.615 --> 22:06.700
NO. TREATED AND RELEASED.

22:06.783 --> 22:09.745
BRING HIM INTO THE HOUSE
AFTER HE'S DONE.

22:12.914 --> 22:14.041
SEE YA, RICO.

22:25.260 --> 22:30.474
UH, ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES
BROUGHT IN A GINGER ALE.

22:30.557 --> 22:33.060
I ASKED FOR A COKE.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.895
YEAH. IN A MINUTE.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.522
YOU GOT SOME
EXPLAINING
TO DO, WILLY.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.024
YES?

22:39.107 --> 22:41.234
SOME DETECTIVES
TALKED TO THE PEOPLE
IN YOUR BUILDING,

22:41.318 --> 22:43.695
ASKED ABOUT YOUR
COMINGS AND GOINGS
AND SO FORTH.

22:43.779 --> 22:44.863
SO?

22:44.946 --> 22:46.740
SO MEL ARNOLD,
YOUR DOORMAN,

22:46.823 --> 22:49.326
HE SAYS YOU LEFT
THE BUILDING
LAST MONDAY

22:49.409 --> 22:52.287
HAULING A BIG
WOODEN BOX
ON A DOLLY.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.872
YOU ROLLED IT
RIGHT THROUGH
THE LOBBY.

22:53.955 --> 22:56.041
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.417
WE GOT 3 OTHER TENANTS
IN THE BUILDING

22:57.501 --> 22:59.002
SAYING THE SAME THING.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.337
WELL, THAT'S
VERY MYSTERIOUS,

23:00.420 --> 23:01.546
BUT IT ISN'T SO.

23:01.630 --> 23:04.091
WILLY, WE KNOW
ABOUT THE MONEY.

23:04.174 --> 23:05.842
MONEY?

23:05.926 --> 23:07.344
THE TRUST FUND
YOU BEEN SPONGING OFF.

23:07.427 --> 23:08.845
WE KNOW THAT
YOUR SISTER WENDY

23:08.929 --> 23:10.305
WAS GONNA PUT
A STOP TO THAT.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.766
WENDY WOULDN'T HAVE
THAT AUTHORITY.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.226
ARE YOU TELLING ME
WHEN WE SEARCH
YOUR PLACE,

23:14.309 --> 23:15.727
WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE
SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE

23:15.811 --> 23:17.104
BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR SISTER--

23:17.187 --> 23:18.605
EVIDENCE THAT
YOU KILLED HER,

23:18.688 --> 23:20.273
THEN BOXED HER UP
AND GOT RID OF HER?

23:20.357 --> 23:22.901
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ,

23:22.984 --> 23:24.236
THAT'S QUITE A TALE.

23:24.319 --> 23:26.279
YOU'RE THE ONE
DREAMED IT UP.

23:26.363 --> 23:29.574
NO. THIS IS A GREAT
MISUNDERSTANDING.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.618
YOU'RE A GEM.

23:31.701 --> 23:34.538
LOOK, WHILE YOU GUYS
ARE SORTING OUT THIS MESS,

23:34.621 --> 23:38.250
MAY I PLEASE
HAVE A SANDWICH...

23:38.333 --> 23:40.544
AND MY DRINK?

23:40.627 --> 23:41.962
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

23:43.463 --> 23:45.382
UH, WE NEED THE ROOM
FOR A LINEUP.

23:45.465 --> 23:46.591
SURE.

23:46.675 --> 23:50.011
WILLY COULD
USE SOME TIME
IN THE CAGE.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.181
GET UP.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.266
Willy: WHAT?

23:56.852 --> 23:57.894
HEY.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.354
COME ON, GET INSIDE.

24:03.233 --> 24:06.528
ARE--ARE YOU GOING
TO GET MY DRINK?

24:22.711 --> 24:24.129
YOU'RE GONNA
SEE 6 GUYS, ROGER,

24:24.212 --> 24:25.380
BUT THEY WON'T
BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.381
UH-HUH.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.883
IF YOU RECOGNIZE
ANYONE,

24:27.966 --> 24:30.093
SAY WHICH NUMBER
AND WHERE YOU
KNOW HIM FROM, OK?

24:30.177 --> 24:31.470
OK. GOT IT.

24:35.223 --> 24:38.268
Medavoy: UH, DISREGARD
THE CAGE CREATURE.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.606
I SEE HIM.
NUMBER 2.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.024
THAT'S THE DUDE
THAT SHOT RICKY.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.359
THIS WAS AT
AVENUE CAR SERVICE
THIS MORNING?

24:46.443 --> 24:47.611
MM-HMM, THAT'S RIGHT.

24:47.694 --> 24:48.695
HE STILL
LOOKS DRUNK, TOO.

24:48.778 --> 24:49.946
HOLD NUMBER 2.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.784
DID ANTHONY
PICK HIM OUT, TOO?

24:54.868 --> 24:56.578
UH, WE GOT
WHAT WE NEED, ROGER.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.955
YEAH. GOT THAT GUY.

25:11.384 --> 25:13.345
MRS. SHATZI?

25:13.428 --> 25:15.889
Woman: I'M SOILED!

25:15.972 --> 25:17.474
I'M SOILED!

25:17.557 --> 25:18.475
MA'AM?

25:18.558 --> 25:21.478
OK, MA'AM.
OK.

25:21.561 --> 25:22.854
I'LL CALL E.M.S.

25:24.147 --> 25:26.566
WE'RE POLICE
DETECTIVES, MA'AM.

25:26.650 --> 25:27.817
WHERE'S WENDY?

25:27.901 --> 25:29.152
SHE CHANGES ME.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.862
WENDY'S NOT HERE.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.364
STILL NOT HERE.

25:32.447 --> 25:33.823
15th SQUAD...

25:33.907 --> 25:35.784
WHEN DID YOU
SEE HER LAST?

25:35.867 --> 25:38.578
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.914
MY MEMORY'S BAD.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.999
HAS WILLY BEEN
CARING FOR YOU?

25:43.083 --> 25:49.172
NO. BLANCA CARES FOR ME
TILL WENDY GETS BACK.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.925
BUT WENDY HASN'T
BEEN BACK.

25:52.008 --> 25:55.762
MRS. SHATZI, I HAVE
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

25:55.845 --> 25:57.597
I WANT YOU TO THINK
REALLY HARD.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.684
HAVE YOU HEARD OR SEEN
ANYTHING UNUSUAL
IN THE APARTMENT

26:00.767 --> 26:01.977
THE PAST WEEK OR SO?

26:02.060 --> 26:04.020
I DON'T THINK SO....

26:04.104 --> 26:05.605
BUT I SLEEP A LOT.

26:05.689 --> 26:09.776
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT
WILLY HAS BEEN MAD
AT WENDY RECENTLY?

26:09.859 --> 26:12.404
HE'S ALWAYS MAD. THEY
HAVE SIBLING RIVALRY.

26:12.487 --> 26:15.448
DID HE EVER GET SO MAD
THAT HE WAS VIOLENT?

26:15.532 --> 26:18.660
WILLY'S HAD A HARD TIME.

26:20.120 --> 26:21.538
WENDY'S MORE ADAPTED.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.081
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"A HARD TIME"?

26:23.164 --> 26:27.043
WENDY WAS JUST A BABY,
SO SHE HARDLY REMEMBERS,

26:27.127 --> 26:28.628
BUT WILLY...

26:28.712 --> 26:33.133
WITNESSED HIS DEAR
LITTLE BROTHER'S DEATH.

26:33.216 --> 26:35.635
TO THIS DAY,
HE'S STILL...

26:35.719 --> 26:39.306
FINDING HIS WAY BACK.

26:42.058 --> 26:43.810
I NEED A BATH.

26:43.893 --> 26:44.978
YES, MA'AM.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.980
WE'VE GOT SOMEONE
COMING ON THE WAY

26:47.063 --> 26:49.274
THAT'S GONNA
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.332
[DOOR OPENS]

27:05.415 --> 27:07.500
HAVE A SEAT, GARY.

27:07.584 --> 27:10.837
I THINK I'D LIKE
TO GET OUT OF HERE
SOMETIME THIS YEAR.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.422
HAVE A SEAT.

27:15.258 --> 27:17.177
CAN I SEE THAT?

27:18.595 --> 27:19.721
YEAH.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.807
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

27:25.602 --> 27:28.688
SO, UH, LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOU AND JOSH

27:28.772 --> 27:30.523
OUT ON THE STAIRS
OF YOUR BUILDING.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.025
HE SLIPPED AND FELL.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.526
HOW MANY TIMES
I GOTTA SAY IT?

27:33.610 --> 27:35.487
YEAH, I KNOW THAT'S
WHAT YOU WERE
GOING WITH, GARY,

27:35.570 --> 27:37.030
BUT WE GOT
A DEAD KID HERE.

27:37.113 --> 27:38.073
YEAH.

27:38.156 --> 27:39.199
SO WE GOTTA
GET SERIOUS.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.326
I KNOW HOW FRUSTRATING
A 6-YEAR-OLD CAN BE,

27:41.409 --> 27:42.994
AND, AS LINDA TELLS IT,

27:43.078 --> 27:44.287
JOSH WAS
KIND OF A HANDFUL.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.705
HE WASN'T
FRUSTRATING ME.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.624
MAYBE YOU TWO WERE
PLAYING AROUND
ON THE STAIRS--

27:47.707 --> 27:48.833
SPARRING, SOMETHING
LIKE THAT?

27:48.917 --> 27:50.293
NO.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.295
'CAUSE SOMEHOW, YOU
ENDED UP PUNCHING HIM
IN THE FACE.

27:52.379 --> 27:53.797
I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE
HOW THAT HAPPENED.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.006
I DIDN'T PUNCH HIM.

27:58.927 --> 28:01.554
THAT'S THE INSIDE
OF JOSH'S SKIN
FROM HIS FOREHEAD.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.014
YOU SEE THAT MARK--

28:03.098 --> 28:04.683
THE DIAMOND SHAPE,
THE "X" THROUGH IT?

28:04.766 --> 28:06.893
THAT REMIND YOU
OF ANYTHING?

28:06.976 --> 28:08.103
HMM?

28:09.604 --> 28:11.231
LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT HIM.

28:11.314 --> 28:12.857
YEAH, I BELIEVE THAT.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.985
AND THAT TAKES IT
DOWN FROM MURDER
TO MANSLAUGHTER.

28:23.493 --> 28:24.911
I TOOK JOSH OUTSIDE.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.914
I TOLD HIM, AMUSE YOURSELF
A LITTLE WHILE

28:27.997 --> 28:30.375
SO LINDA AND I COULD
GET SOME TIME TOGETHER.

28:30.458 --> 28:33.545
HE STARTS CRYING.
HE-HE'S COLD.

28:33.628 --> 28:36.256
HE...HE WOULDN'T
OBEY ME.

28:36.339 --> 28:38.842
I DID GET FRUSTRATED.
I...

28:39.467 --> 28:41.094
I GAVE HIM A SHOVE.

28:41.177 --> 28:42.053
THE RING, GARY.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.388
THE MARK
ON HIS HEAD.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.514
ALL RIGHT.

28:44.597 --> 28:47.058
I GAVE HIM A SMACK,
A PUNCH.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.227
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
HOW HE WENT FLYING.

28:53.189 --> 28:54.566
WRITE DOWN
WHAT YOU TOLD ME

28:54.649 --> 28:56.985
AND SHOW YOUR SORROW
ABOUT LOSING JOSH.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.361
THAT'LL BE THE BEST
ANGLE FOR YOU.

28:58.445 --> 28:59.863
I CAN'T GO TO JAIL.

28:59.946 --> 29:03.283
IF I GO TO JAIL,
MY LIFE IS OVER.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.469
HOW'D IT GO
AT YOUR GUY'S
APARTMENT?

29:22.552 --> 29:25.013
FIRST THING WE FIND'S
AN 80-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
IN DIRTY DIAPERS.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.015
NO FOOD ANYWHERE,

29:27.098 --> 29:28.516
JUST SOME SODAS
IN THE FRIDGE.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.185
THAT'S HOW THIS GUY
TAKES CARE OF HIS MOM.

29:30.268 --> 29:31.728
YOU SEND SOMEONE
TO TEND TO HER?

29:31.811 --> 29:33.146
E.M.S. TOOK HER IN.

29:33.229 --> 29:34.647
AND THE SEARCH?

29:34.731 --> 29:35.982
CAME UP WITH ENOUGH
TO KNOW THAT THIS
IS OUR GUY.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.525
BEEN LYING
LIKE A SON OF A BITCH.

29:37.609 --> 29:38.902
THAT'S GONNA STOP.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.078
THE SANDWICH
WAS VERY GOOD.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.622
WE'RE SURE GLAD.

29:50.705 --> 29:52.832
BUT THEY GAVE ME
A PEPSI.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.168
I THINK I MADE MYSELF
DULY CLEAR TWICE

29:55.251 --> 29:57.086
WHAT KIND OF SODA
I WANTED.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.088
WE'VE BEEN AT
YOUR APARTMENT, WILLY.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.508
WE FOUND YOUR MOTHER
HELPLESS IN BED.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.218
YEAH. SHE'S VERY ILL.

30:03.301 --> 30:06.179
BUT YOU DON'T SEE FIT
TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

30:06.262 --> 30:07.680
MY SISTER WENDY
DOES THAT.

30:07.764 --> 30:10.183
WELL, WENDY'S DEAD.
WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT.

30:10.266 --> 30:11.184
YEAH.

30:11.267 --> 30:12.852
LET'S RUN DOWN
THE LIST OF THINGS

30:12.936 --> 30:16.064
THAT WE FOUND AT YOUR PLACE
THAT WE CONSIDER RELEVANT,
SHALL WE?

30:16.147 --> 30:19.901
NUMBER ONE--SPLATTERED BLOOD
AROUND THE BOTTOM
OF YOUR DOOR.

30:19.984 --> 30:20.902
STRANGE.

30:20.985 --> 30:21.986
NUMBER 2--

30:22.070 --> 30:24.072
LUMBER,
A HAMMER, SAW.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.115
CARPENTRY'S A HOBBY.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.951
A DAY CALENDAR
ON YOUR DESK.

30:28.034 --> 30:29.786
SHALL WE READ IT ALOUD?

30:29.869 --> 30:30.870
HERE.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.374
WEDNESDAY--

30:34.457 --> 30:37.377
"THIS IS IT.
MAKE A DECISION."

30:37.460 --> 30:38.378
THURSDAY--

30:38.461 --> 30:40.046
"BUY NAILS AND DOLLY."

30:40.129 --> 30:41.714
FRIDAY--YOU GOT NOTHING
ON FRIDAY.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.259
I GUESS YOU WERE
BUSY ALL DAY
BUILDING THAT BOX.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.885
I DIDN'T MAKE A BOX.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.387
SATURDAY--
"MISSION COMPLETE."

30:47.470 --> 30:49.472
MONDAY--
"GARBAGE PICKUP, 8:15."

30:49.556 --> 30:50.849
DO I NEED TO GO ON HERE?

30:50.932 --> 30:52.350
THIS IS NOT MY CALENDAR.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.143
OH, NO?
MAYBE IT'S YOUR MOTHER'S.

30:54.227 --> 30:57.230
HAS SHE ALSO GOT AN INTEREST
IN CARPENTRY?

30:57.313 --> 30:59.232
SOMEONE MUST BE
SETTING ME UP.

30:59.315 --> 31:01.234
WE FOUND EVERYTHING
AT YOUR PLACE

31:01.317 --> 31:03.236
EXCEPT FOR THAT T-SHIRT
YOU HAD MADE UP--

31:03.319 --> 31:04.696
"I KILLED MY SISTER."

31:04.779 --> 31:05.905
NONSENSE.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.073
WILLY,
YOU'RE CAUGHT!

31:07.156 --> 31:09.075
HOW CAN YOU SIT THERE
AND DENY THIS?

31:09.158 --> 31:11.661
I SIMPLY DIDN'T DO IT.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.000
MAY I HAVE
MY REFRESHMENT NOW?

31:17.083 --> 31:18.501
YOU ARE NOT LEAVING HERE

31:18.585 --> 31:20.169
UNTIL YOU TELL
THE TRUTH, WILLY.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.588
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

31:21.671 --> 31:24.591
NOW, WE THREE
WILL SIT HERE ALL NIGHT
IF WE GOT TO,

31:24.674 --> 31:28.303
UNTIL YOU SAY
WHAT YOU DID WITH WENDY.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.456
YOU GO AHEAD
AND HAVE A SEAT.

31:56.539 --> 31:58.958
CAN I OFFER YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

31:59.042 --> 32:01.461
UH, LET ME
GET TO THE POINT
WHY WE'RE HERE.

32:01.544 --> 32:03.087
SURE.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.298
WE UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE
A PUERTO RICAN MAN
IN CUSTODY

32:05.381 --> 32:06.925
FOR MY NEPHEW'S DEATH.

32:07.008 --> 32:10.011
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE WAS IDENTIFIED BY 2 MEN
AS HAVING SHOT RICKY.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.014
HE DIDN'T.

32:14.223 --> 32:16.142
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

32:16.225 --> 32:19.979
THE MAN WHO SHOT RICKY
HAS CONFESSED TO DARLENE.

32:20.063 --> 32:23.149
HE CAME TO HER
ASKING FORGIVENESS.

32:23.232 --> 32:25.360
WE DON'T WANT TO SAY
WHO IT IS.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.028
IT'S JUST THAT YOU GOT
THE WRONG MAN HERE.

32:27.111 --> 32:29.614
THIS PUERTO RICAN
SHOULDN'T GO TO JAIL
FOR THIS SHOOTING.

32:29.697 --> 32:33.034
WE'RE GONNA NEED
MORE OF AN EXPLANATION
THAN THAT.

32:33.117 --> 32:34.494
I DON'T WANT
TROUBLE.

32:34.577 --> 32:36.996
MRS. POWELL,
YOU GIVING US INFORMATION
ON THE HOMICIDE

32:37.080 --> 32:38.331
WITHOUT BACKING IT UP,

32:38.414 --> 32:40.208
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
NOT HAVE COME IN HERE AT ALL.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.503
WE CAN'T LET SOMEONE GO
JUST BECAUSE YOU SAY TO.

32:43.586 --> 32:46.214
BUT I'VE FORGIVEN
WHO KILLED MY BOY.

32:46.297 --> 32:47.674
CAN'T THAT BE ENOUGH?

32:47.757 --> 32:50.426
NO. I'M--I'M SORRY.
IT CAN'T.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.640
WELL, I PERSONALLY BELIEVE
HE SHOULD BE PUNISHED.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.519
WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
