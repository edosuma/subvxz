11:09.625 --> 11:12.802
NO, NO. WE TELL NO ONE
ABOUT THE LIST. NO ONE.

11:12.802 --> 11:14.978
WELL, IF RED JOHN KNOWS
ABOUT THE LIST ALREADY--

11:14.978 --> 11:16.545
ANYONE ELSE THAT KNOWS
ABOUT THE LIST

11:16.545 --> 11:18.155
WILL BE IN DANGER.

11:18.155 --> 11:20.592
WE TELL NO ONE.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.986
I SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN
TOLD YOU.

11:22.986 --> 11:26.033
[inhales and exhales]

11:26.033 --> 11:28.992
[indistinct conversations,
police radio chatter]

11:37.958 --> 11:40.482
[flies buzzing]

11:49.099 --> 11:51.754
KIND OF BEAUTIFUL
AND WEIRD, HUH?

11:51.754 --> 11:54.409
ALL THE FLOWERS.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.324
HEY, PARTRIDGE.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.023
HOW LONG'S THE BODY
BEEN HERE?

12:00.023 --> 12:02.156
ABOUT 18 MONTHS, PROBABLY.
UH...

12:02.156 --> 12:04.636
WE THINK HE WAS A LARGE MALE,
EARLY 40s, MAYBE.

12:04.636 --> 12:06.856
NO TEETH, NO FINGERS.
PROBABLY REMOVED

12:06.856 --> 12:08.640
BY WHOEVER BROUGHT HIM HERE
TO PREVENT IDENTIFICATION.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.512
BUT I BET IF YOU
CROSS-REFERENCE THAT FRAT RING--

12:10.512 --> 12:11.818
THAT'S WHAT SHE'S DOING.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.385
GOT YOU. YEAH.

12:14.385 --> 12:17.693
[Van Pelt] Hey, boss.
Brooke Yardley.

12:17.693 --> 12:21.175
HE WAS A LOS ANGELES
REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER, 46.

12:21.175 --> 12:24.004
HIS WIFE REPORTED HIM MISSING
IN AUGUST OF 2011.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.702
I-I WANT YOU TO RUN
A FULL PROFILE ON THIS GUY ASAP.

12:26.702 --> 12:27.703
WILL DO.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.532
HELLO, MR. YARDLEY.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.664
[buzzing continues]

12:32.664 --> 12:35.363
WHO DID THIS TO YA? HMM?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.018
HOW LONG UNTIL YOU'RE DONE
WITH FORENSICS

12:38.018 --> 12:39.889
AND YOU PULL THIS GUY
OUT OF HERE?

12:39.889 --> 12:41.673
DELICATE JOB.

12:41.673 --> 12:44.111
OH, WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE BY
TOMORROW MORNING, PROBABLY.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.027
[buzzing continues]

12:47.027 --> 12:48.158
SOMETHING WRONG?

12:48.158 --> 12:49.725
WRONG?

12:49.725 --> 12:51.292
YOU'VE BEEN REALLY SULLEN
WITH ME RECENTLY,

12:51.292 --> 12:53.120
AND NOW YOU'RE STARING
AT ME STRANGELY,

12:53.120 --> 12:55.383
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.173
YOU TRULY DON'T KNOW?

13:03.173 --> 13:07.090
[scoffs] NO.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.833
HMM.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.888
YARDLEY WAS A WHEELER-DEALER
SALESMAN TYPE.[mouse clicking]

13:21.888 --> 13:23.759
NO CRIMINAL RECORD,
BUT HE HAD HIS SHARE

13:23.759 --> 13:25.239
OF LAW AND TAX PROBLEMS.

13:25.239 --> 13:26.544
BANKRUPT TWICE.

13:26.544 --> 13:28.633
His car was found
abandoned in Los Angeles

13:28.633 --> 13:30.766
a couple weeks
after his disappearance.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.246
ANY STANDOUT ENEMIES?

13:32.246 --> 13:33.900
Not off his paper trail.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.640
CHO AND RIGSBY ARE DRIVING
TO L.A. IN THE MORNING

13:35.640 --> 13:37.251
TO TALK TO THE WIFE
AND SON.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.992
ALL RIGHT. JANE AND I NEED
TO STAY OUT HERE

13:38.992 --> 13:41.342
NEAR THE CRIME SCENE
TILL THE BODY'S DUG UP.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.257
WE'LL GIVE YOU A CALL
WHEN WE FIND SOMEPLACE TO STAY.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.955
Sure.[sighs]

13:45.955 --> 13:48.001
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE
ON PARTRIDGE?

13:48.001 --> 13:50.742
IF HE IS RED JOHN,
HE'S A VERY GOOD ACTOR.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.309
HE WOULD HAVE TO BE,
WOULDN'T HE?

13:56.487 --> 13:58.315
OH, LET--LET'S TURN HERE.

13:58.315 --> 14:00.187
THIS LOOKS INTERESTING.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.731
[grill sizzling][woman] THANKS, HON.

14:22.731 --> 14:24.646

14:24.646 --> 14:26.996
HEY, FOLKS.HEY.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.925
OKAY.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.361
COFFEE AND MUFFIN.

14:44.361 --> 14:47.190
OKAY. COMING RIGHT UP.[tears paper]

14:47.190 --> 14:49.758
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT
THE DEAD GUY, I GUESS.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.368
[clicks pen]

14:51.368 --> 14:54.502
YEAH, SURE.
EVERYBODY HAS.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.721
WE'RE WITH THE CBI.
WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE CASE.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.854
YEAH. SORRY, I--
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.204
OH, NO, NO. I--
I'M NOT SCARED.

15:01.204 --> 15:04.729
I JUST... I'VE HAD
A BAD FEELING FOREVER,

15:04.729 --> 15:06.427
LIKE I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING EVIL OUT THERE.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.994
I KNEW IT.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.473
DIDN'T I, HEC?

15:09.473 --> 15:11.171
UH-HUH.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.650
HUH.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.523
[grill sizzling]HMM, COME TO THINK

15:15.523 --> 15:17.829
THAT I'M RIGHT?
MY GOSH.

15:17.829 --> 15:20.223
[pouring coffee]I MEAN, I ALWAYS KNEW
I HAD A PSYCHIC GIFT,

15:20.223 --> 15:22.356
BUT THIS IS DAMN SPOOKY.

15:22.356 --> 15:24.967
PSYCHIC GIFT?
EXCELLENT.

15:26.316 --> 15:29.406
TELL ME, UH,
WILL I ENJOY YOUR EGGS?

15:29.406 --> 15:32.366
[clicks tongue]
YOU BETCHA. [giggles]

15:34.107 --> 15:35.499
WE'LL SEE.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.895
MMM.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.505
YOU'RE RIGHT, SONYA.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.551
THESE ARE ENJOYABLE EGGS.

15:43.551 --> 15:46.162
[chuckles]ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT,
BUT VERY ENJOYABLE.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.555
GOOD.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.602
WHAT ARE WE DOING, JANE?

15:51.602 --> 15:53.604
I'M EATING EGGS. YOU'RE
STARING AT A DRY MUFFIN.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.084
WE NEED A PLAN.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.651
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT.

15:56.651 --> 15:59.088
IN THE MEANTIME, RED JOHN
IS GONNA KILL AGAIN.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.743
YEAH, PROBABLY.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.745
JANE, I'M SCARED.

16:03.745 --> 16:05.094
HE'S NOT PSYCHIC.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.704
WELL, THAT'S NOT
WHAT SCARES ME.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.228
WELL, NO,
THAT SCARES ME, TOO.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.186
THERE'S NO SUCH THING.

16:10.186 --> 16:13.102
I'M SCARED BECAUSE I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU LIKE THIS BEFORE.

16:13.102 --> 16:14.886
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.324
[clicks tongue] NEXT?
WELL, PECAN PIE.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.804
FUNNY. FUNNY.
I'M SERIOUS.SO AM I.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.502
WE NEED HELP.NO.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.290

[cell phone buzzes]

16:51.053 --> 16:52.402
HEY, BOSS.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.970
Hey, we need to talk.
Are you alone?

16:54.970 --> 16:58.365
Y-YEAH. WELL, I MEAN,
WAYNE'S WITH ME.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.280
CALL ME BACK AS SOON
AS YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.979
HELLO? HELLO?

17:05.589 --> 17:06.982
LOST HER.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.418
BAD SIGNAL
IN THE DESERT.

17:08.418 --> 17:11.987
SHE'LL CALL RIGHT BACK.YEP.

17:11.987 --> 17:14.598
[paper in file rustles]

17:14.598 --> 17:16.644
GIVE ME A MOMENT, HUH?

17:16.644 --> 17:18.515
SURE.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.778
YOU OKAY?I'M FINE.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.875
[door closes]

17:30.875 --> 17:34.183
You cannot tell anyone
what I'm about to tell you.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.011
OKAY.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.883
JANE HAS WORKED OUT THAT
RED JOHN IS ONE OF SEVEN MEN.

17:38.883 --> 17:41.060
But Red John also knows

17:41.060 --> 17:42.713
THE SEVEN NAMES
ON JANE'S LIST.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.976
HOW?We don't know.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.848
IT'S LIKE HE'S READ
JANE'S MIND,

17:46.848 --> 17:49.372
WHICH HAS MADE JANE
PARANOID, UNDERSTANDABLY.

17:49.372 --> 17:53.072
He doesn't want anyone
to know about the list of names.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.422
He doesn't know I'm talking
to you right now.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.206
HE THINKS WHOEVER KNOWS ABOUT
THE NAMES IS IN DANGER,

17:57.206 --> 17:58.816
AND HE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.

17:58.816 --> 18:02.037
BUT I HAVE A STRONG FEELING
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING,

18:02.037 --> 18:03.517
AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.259
Do you want me to continue?YES.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.912
Thank you.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.827
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
THE SEVEN NAMES,

18:09.827 --> 18:11.916
AND I NEED YOU TO PUT
A G.P.S. BUG

18:11.916 --> 18:13.570
ON EACH OF THEIR CELL PHONES.

18:13.570 --> 18:16.312
BUT YOU NEED TO DO IT SECRETLY.
TELL NO ONE.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.271
Can you do that?YES, I CAN,

18:18.271 --> 18:20.011
BUT WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA TELL JANE?

18:20.011 --> 18:21.752
WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT.

18:21.752 --> 18:24.712
OKAY, I GUESS. UM...

18:24.712 --> 18:26.409
LET ME GET A PEN AND PAPER.

18:26.409 --> 18:28.585
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WRITE ANYTHING DOWN.

18:30.239 --> 18:32.241
[exhales]

18:34.548 --> 18:37.855
[sighs] EVERYTHING OKAY?

18:37.855 --> 18:40.597
SURE, OF COURSE.
I, UM...

18:40.597 --> 18:42.208
SPOKE TO LISBON.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.861
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

18:43.861 --> 18:46.037
WORK? NOW?

18:46.037 --> 18:47.430
WHAT'S SO URGENT?

18:47.430 --> 18:51.869
OH... YOU KNOW LISBON.
NO SENSE OF TIME.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.654
YOU GO ON HOME.
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

18:55.438 --> 18:56.744
WHAT'S GOING ON, GRACE?

18:56.744 --> 18:58.789
NOTHING.

19:20.855 --> 19:23.466
[inhales and exhales]

19:23.466 --> 19:24.946
SOMETHING WRONG?

19:24.946 --> 19:26.643
NO.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.255
[sighs]

19:29.255 --> 19:30.865
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:30.865 --> 19:33.389
YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD,

19:33.389 --> 19:34.912
LIKE YOU'RE KEEPING
SOMETHING FROM ME.

19:34.912 --> 19:37.524
[scoffs] WHAT?
NO, DUDE.

19:37.524 --> 19:40.440
WHAT WOULD I BE KEEPING
FROM YOU?[exhales]

19:40.440 --> 19:42.485
YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD.

19:42.485 --> 19:43.834
WEIRD, LIKE HOW?

19:45.619 --> 19:47.882
LIKE YOU CAN'T LOOK ME
IN THE EYE.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.927
YES, I CAN.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.277
YOU HAPPY NOW?

19:51.277 --> 19:52.887
NO. WHAT'S GOING ON,
WAYNE?

19:56.412 --> 19:58.022
AM I INTRUDING?

19:58.022 --> 19:59.981
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S MY HUSBAND?

19:59.981 --> 20:01.461
MRS. YARDLEY, WE--

20:01.461 --> 20:02.505
MADISON.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.594
MADISON. I'M SORRY.

20:04.594 --> 20:06.335
WE'RE DEALING
WITH A SKELETON HERE,

20:06.335 --> 20:07.684
SO WE CAN'T BE SURE OF I.D.

20:07.684 --> 20:09.164
UNTIL D.N.A. TEST RESULTS
ARE DONE.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.861
BUT WE THINK SO, YES.

20:10.861 --> 20:14.387
OH, THANK GOD.
[sighs] MM!

20:14.387 --> 20:16.171
[inhales sharply]
WELL, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

20:16.171 --> 20:19.218
I LOVED BROOKE VERY MUCH,
BUT I'VE KNOWN IN MY HEART

20:19.218 --> 20:21.045
HE'S BEEN DEAD
FOR SOME TIME NOW.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.047
HE WOULD NEVER HAVE RUN AWAY
WITHOUT A WORD.

20:23.047 --> 20:25.398
[breathes deeply] IT'S JUST GOOD
TO FINALLY KNOW THE TRUTH.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.965
I'VE BEEN IN THEMOST
HELLISH LIMBO.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.490
RECORDS INDICATE HE HAD
STARTED DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS.

20:30.490 --> 20:33.493
YES. IT WAS
A MUTUAL DECISION.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.538
YOU CAN LOVE SOMEONE
VERY MUCH

20:35.538 --> 20:38.062
AND NOT BE ABLE
TO LIVE WITH THEM.WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?

20:38.062 --> 20:41.065
OH, BROOKE WAS A DOG.
PATHOLOGICAL WOMANIZER.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.719
I KNEW IT
WHEN I MARRIED HIM.

20:42.719 --> 20:44.460
I'M HIS THIRD WIFE. DUH.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.636
BUT HE WAS SO CHARMING
AND WITTY AND HANDSOME.

20:46.636 --> 20:48.377
HE CHEATED ON YOU.

20:48.377 --> 20:51.206
CHEATING WOULD INVOLVE
DECEPTION.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.816
HE NEVER TRIED
TO DECEIVE ME.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.514
SOME WOULD CALL THAT
GOOD MOTIVE FOR KILLING HIM.

20:54.514 --> 20:55.819
WELL, I DIDN'T.

20:57.386 --> 20:59.693
BUT I KNOW WHO DID
KILL HIM,

20:59.693 --> 21:01.477
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.218
I TOLD THE POLICE TWO YEARS AGO,
BUT THEY WEREN'T INTERESTED.

21:03.218 --> 21:04.741
"NO BODY, NO CRIME,"
THEY SAID.

21:04.741 --> 21:07.309
SO YOU KNOW
WHO KILLED HIM.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.746
A MAN CALLED AREK GREEN.

21:09.746 --> 21:12.227
HE OWNS NIGHTCLUBS
ACROSS THE BORDER.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.273
BROOKE WENT TO A MEETING
WITH AREK IN MEXICALI,

21:14.273 --> 21:16.362
AND THAT WAS THE LAST
ANYONE EVER SAW BROOKE.

21:16.362 --> 21:19.190
AND WHY WOULD MR. GREEN HAVE
REASON TO KILL YOUR HUSBAND?

21:19.190 --> 21:21.932
AREK OWED BROOKE SOMETHING
AROUND $100,000

21:21.932 --> 21:23.630
ON A PROPERTY DEAL
AND DIDN'T WANT TO PAY.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.501
BROOKE WAS GOING TO SUE HIM.

21:25.501 --> 21:28.025
THAT'S MOTIVE, ISN'T IT?[door opens]

21:31.986 --> 21:36.599
THIS IS MY STEPSON GAVIN.
HE LIVES HERE ALSO.

21:36.599 --> 21:39.080
THESE ARE POLICE
OF SOME KIND.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.690
THEY FOUND
YOUR FATHER'S BODY.

21:42.431 --> 21:44.955
[Gavin] OH.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.262
REALLY? WHERE?

21:47.262 --> 21:48.350

21:52.267 --> 21:53.529

21:55.226 --> 21:57.968
WELL, I'D TAKE A GOOD, LONG
LOOK AT THIS ONE.

21:57.968 --> 22:00.928
SHE'S PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF MURDER.

22:00.928 --> 22:04.148
TOO LAZY, PERHAPS, BUT SHE COULD
HAVE SUMMONED A BURST OF ENERGY.

22:04.148 --> 22:07.282
SHE DID SO DESPISE
MY POOR, DEAR FATHER.

22:07.282 --> 22:10.503
YOU ARE A BITTER, TWISTED
LITTLE FANTASIST.

22:10.503 --> 22:13.027
WE HAD OUR BATTLES,
BUT I LOVED THAT MAN.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.507
OH! DISHONEST CRAP.

JULY 10, TWO YEARS AGO.
I APOLOGIZE FOR MY STEPSON.

22:27.302 --> 22:29.957
WHEN BROOKE IS OFFICIALLY DEAD,
HIS WILL IS ENFORCEABLE,

22:29.957 --> 22:32.307
AND GAVIN WILL HAVE TO LEAVE
MY HOUSE.

22:32.307 --> 22:33.961
[whispers] FINALLY.

22:33.961 --> 22:35.789

22:47.322 --> 22:50.194
I BLAME HIS MOTHER.
NOW SHE WAS A PIECE OF WORK.

DON'T YOU SAY A WORD
ABOUT MY MOTHER,

22:51.848 --> 22:53.850

22:53.850 --> 22:55.809
I WILL TALK ABOUT

22:55.809 --> 22:58.115
YOUR MOTHER WAS
A COLD-HEARTED BITCH!

22:58.115 --> 22:59.508

23:41.507 --> 23:43.160

23:49.558 --> 23:51.821
SO BOTH YARDLEY'S SON
AND WIFE

23:51.821 --> 23:53.519
ARE STILL POSSIBLE SUSPECTS.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.956

SHE SAW YARDLEY,

23:55.956 --> 23:57.479

24:21.808 --> 24:23.940

24:23.940 --> 24:25.551
DON'T TRUST ME ALONE, HUH?

24:25.551 --> 24:27.988

32:37.912 --> 32:40.306
"K"...

32:40.306 --> 32:41.785
"E"...

32:43.744 --> 32:45.093
"12"...

32:45.093 --> 32:46.921
"27."

32:48.879 --> 32:50.185
LUKE 12:27?

32:53.188 --> 32:56.191
IS THERE ANYONE CONNECTED
TO THE CASE NAMED LUKE?

32:56.191 --> 32:58.193
MAYBE IT'S THE, UH,
BIBLE VERSE?

32:58.193 --> 33:02.284
LUKE12:27. WH--WHAT DOES--
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?

33:02.284 --> 33:05.505
"CONSIDER THE LILIES,
HOW THEY GROW.

33:05.505 --> 33:08.421
"THEY TOIL NOT...""NEITHER DO THEY SPIN."

33:10.031 --> 33:12.120
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

33:12.120 --> 33:13.382
I DON'T KNOW.

33:15.254 --> 33:17.691
WAIT A MINUTE.
"HOW THEY GROW."

33:17.691 --> 33:21.129
YARDLEY HAD LILIES ON HIS GRAVE.
WELL, FLOWERS, ANYWAY.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.957
UH, NOT--NOT THE NORMAL KIND
OF FLOWERS

33:22.957 --> 33:26.482
YOU'D SEE IN THE DESERT.
AND GRASS, FOR THAT MATTER.

33:26.482 --> 33:28.223
THAT'S WHAT HE'S TRYING
TO TELL US.

33:28.223 --> 33:31.357
HOW DID THOSE FLOWERS
END UP THERE?

33:31.357 --> 33:33.707
AND--AND HOW DID THEY
GET WATER?

33:35.404 --> 33:37.363
WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE
LOGICAL EXPLANATION.

33:37.363 --> 33:39.408
THE BODY WAS IN A BLOCK OF ICE.

33:39.408 --> 33:44.892
A BLOCK OF ICE THAT WAS
CARRIED IN A FLAT-BED TRUCK

33:44.892 --> 33:47.851
THAT NORMALLY CARRIES
GARDEN SUPPLIES,

33:47.851 --> 33:51.333
LIKE FLOWER AND GRASS SEEDS.

33:51.333 --> 33:55.163
SEEDS THAT STUCK
TO A BLOCK OF ICE.

33:55.163 --> 33:57.209
CLEVER.YES, BUT...

33:57.209 --> 33:59.341
BUT ICE MELTS VERY FAST
IN THE DESERT,

33:59.341 --> 34:02.736
SO THAT BLOCK COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MOVED VERY FAR FROM THE START.

34:02.736 --> 34:05.043
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
IS SOMEPLACE

34:05.043 --> 34:06.914
CLOSE TO THE CRIME SCENE

34:06.914 --> 34:10.178
WHERE THEY HAVE A LARGE
COMMERCIAL FREEZER.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.397
LIKE IN A DINER.

34:11.397 --> 34:12.833
YES.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.575
BUT WHY WOULD ANYONE
AT THE DINER

34:15.575 --> 34:17.925
WANT TO KILL BROOKE YARDLEY?

34:17.925 --> 34:20.754
YEAH, I... [chuckles]
HELLO.

34:20.754 --> 34:23.017
WELL, UNLESS, OF COURSE,
HE WAS...

34:23.017 --> 34:26.020
FLASHING ALL THAT MONEY
HE HAD.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.501
AND HE WAS THAT KIND OF GUY.

34:28.501 --> 34:31.504
YOU KNOW, A SHOWOFF
AND A LADIES' MAN, RIGHT?

34:31.504 --> 34:32.809
YES.

34:34.246 --> 34:36.378
I BET HE HIT ON YOU, SONYA.
YEAH?

34:36.378 --> 34:38.989
WELL, YOU SAID NO, OF COURSE.

34:38.989 --> 34:40.730
THEN HE OFFERED YOU MONEY.

34:42.732 --> 34:44.082
[Patrick]
AND YOU'RE A GOOD WOMAN,

34:44.082 --> 34:46.910
BUT EVERYONE HAS
THEIR PRICE.

34:46.910 --> 34:48.608
[laughs]

34:48.608 --> 34:51.524
YOUR BOYFRIEND HECTOR
IS THE JEALOUS TYPE.

34:51.524 --> 34:53.003
BUT BROOKE WAS A BIG MAN,

34:53.003 --> 34:55.310
SO PROBABLY HE GOT MAC
TO HELP OUT.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.834
[shouts]

35:00.315 --> 35:03.710
THEN THE THREE OF YOU
ARGUED OVER WHAT TO DO NEXT.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.755
DO YOU LET YARDLEY GO,
OR DO YOU KILL HIM

35:05.755 --> 35:07.322
AND TAKE THE MONEY?

35:07.322 --> 35:10.717
YOUR BIGGEST MISTAKE--
YOU LET HIM HEAR YOU.

35:10.717 --> 35:13.502
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?WE HAVE TO KILL HIM.

35:14.808 --> 35:16.505
[Patrick]
HE KNEW HE WAS GONNA DIE,

35:16.505 --> 35:19.117
SO HE MADE SURE
HIS BODY WAS IDENTIFIABLE

35:19.117 --> 35:20.640
BY SWALLOWING HIS RING.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.468
MAC'S RIGHT.
WE GOTTA KILL HIM!

35:22.468 --> 35:24.513
NO! MAC! NO!

35:24.513 --> 35:25.732
[thud]

35:27.386 --> 35:28.865
[scoffs]

35:28.865 --> 35:30.302
THIS IS GARBAGE.

35:30.302 --> 35:32.304
FANTASY.
YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE.

35:32.304 --> 35:34.654
THIS FROM A MAN
WEARING A HAT

35:34.654 --> 35:38.397
THAT SAYS "LANDSCAPING
AND GARDENING SUPPLIES."

35:38.397 --> 35:39.746
THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER GUYS

35:39.746 --> 35:41.487
THAT WORK AT GARDEN SUPPLY
STORES.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.837
AND PLENTY OF OTHER DINERS
THAT GOT FREEZERS.

35:43.837 --> 35:46.883
YES, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY ONE
WITH A FANCY NEW SIGN

35:46.883 --> 35:48.755
ON THE HIGHWAY.
HOW MUCH DID THAT COST YOU?

35:57.155 --> 35:58.634
I-IT WAS THEM!

35:58.634 --> 36:01.550
THEY KILLED HIM.
THEY TRIED TO KEEP ME QUIET.

36:01.550 --> 36:02.856
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

36:02.856 --> 36:04.292
[Sonya gasping]

36:04.292 --> 36:06.338
BOOK 'EM, GUYS.

36:11.169 --> 36:15.216
