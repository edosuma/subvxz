So are you gonna dance
with me or not, Turtle?

01:21.271 --> 01:23.006
Not. I told you
I don't dance.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.475
None of them do.

01:25.509 --> 01:28.011
- Sorry, Drama.
- I move so good, Alex,

01:28.045 --> 01:30.046
I should be on
"Dancing with the Stars."

01:30.080 --> 01:32.181
And if he were a star,
he probably would be.

01:32.216 --> 01:33.716
You hear that,
Mr. Manager?

01:33.751 --> 01:36.419
I found you a show, Drama,
you just have to be open to it.

01:36.453 --> 01:37.820
I will not be a cartoon monkey.

01:37.855 --> 01:41.290
And nobody better even say the
word "monkey" in my presence.

01:41.325 --> 01:44.060
- I like monkeys.
- So do I.

01:45.696 --> 01:47.530
- Yo, Turtle! - Yo, Yori, what up?
Is Vince in there?

01:47.564 --> 01:49.732
- Just like you said he was, bro.
- Told you.

01:49.767 --> 01:52.268
Tipping off the paparazzi
to Vince's whereabouts now?

01:52.302 --> 01:54.037
Traded an Avion shoutout
for a tip.

01:54.071 --> 01:56.305
- Vince was cool with it.
- Awesome.

01:56.340 --> 01:57.840
All right, peace out.

02:12.690 --> 02:15.091
Oh. Are they
getting serious?

02:15.125 --> 02:17.026
- Naw. - They look
pretty serious to me.

02:17.061 --> 02:19.462
<i>Naw, Vince don't get serious.
They're trashed.</i>

02:19.496 --> 02:21.698
Hey, what's up, guys?
I didn't want to bug Vince,

02:21.732 --> 02:24.667
- but I got your table ready.
You're over there. - Thanks, Brent.

02:24.702 --> 02:27.270
- Let's go sit.
- Thank you.

02:32.309 --> 02:34.677
- They're kinda making me sick.
- Yeah.

02:34.712 --> 02:37.246
<i>- You wanna go?
- Do you mind?</i>

02:37.281 --> 02:40.983
- I wanna go too.
- All right, let's get out of here.

02:41.018 --> 02:44.587
- Hey, Vince, Sasha, we'll see you guys later.
- Bye, Sasha.

02:44.621 --> 02:46.789
- Where are you guys going?
- Seriously.

02:46.824 --> 02:49.125
The night's young. I was going to
order another bottle of tequila.

02:49.159 --> 02:51.961
- No more ordering my competition, vin.
- Right, sorry.

02:51.995 --> 02:53.763
I'll switch it to vodka.

02:53.797 --> 02:56.733
I don't think you want to mix
tequila and vodka, Vince.

02:56.767 --> 02:58.534
Jesus, relax, whatever.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.837
- Let's all hang.
- We gotta work tomorrow.

03:00.871 --> 03:03.306
- I got a Carlos meeting.
- Johnny?

03:03.340 --> 03:06.209
No, bro, I'm gonna hit
the gym early,

03:06.243 --> 03:08.211
take out my frustrations
on the heavy bag.

03:08.245 --> 03:11.814
- Hey!
- Maybe one more dance.

03:11.849 --> 03:13.116
All right, later.

03:13.150 --> 03:14.517
- See you.
- See you.

03:14.551 --> 03:16.486
- Bye.
- Pussies.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.987
We don't need them.

03:18.021 --> 03:20.189
No we don't.

03:20.224 --> 03:22.325
Do we need these?

03:22.359 --> 03:25.495
- No.
- But do you want 'em?

03:34.271 --> 03:35.838
His vibe is just off.

03:35.873 --> 03:37.707
He has been drinking
a ton all week.

03:37.741 --> 03:40.443
- He needs to get back to work.
- What's he doing next?

03:40.477 --> 03:42.845
- A big superhero movie.
- Yeah, hopefully.

03:45.015 --> 03:47.350
Yo, what's up, Phil?

03:47.384 --> 03:50.419
Yo, Eric. I just ran into our
studio head at a screening.

03:50.454 --> 03:52.155
<i>- Yeah?
- You ready for this?</i>

03:52.189 --> 03:54.123
- Yeah.
- He went bananas for Johnny.

03:54.158 --> 03:56.192
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

03:56.226 --> 03:58.861
He wants to know who's animating
but he thinks it's a go.

03:58.896 --> 04:01.764
- Phil, that's great. - I wanted to let
you know so you could tell your boy.

04:01.799 --> 04:03.966
<i>- All right, thanks a lot.
- We'll talk tomorrow.</i>

04:04.001 --> 04:05.968
I'll talk to you
tomorrow, Phil.

04:06.003 --> 04:08.538
- What happened?
- They want to make Drama's cartoon.

04:08.572 --> 04:10.540
That's amazing.
You want to tell him?

04:10.574 --> 04:13.176
Just don't call him monkey.

04:13.210 --> 04:15.478
You know what?
Maybe I'll wait till the morning.

04:15.512 --> 04:18.079
Let's get out of here.

04:27.724 --> 04:29.826
- Baby, you sleeping?
- Nope.

04:29.860 --> 04:33.229
Me neither. The guest bed is not
designed for an athletically-built man.

04:33.763 --> 04:36.365
- I didn't tell you to sleep in there.
- Yeah, you kinda did.

04:36.399 --> 04:38.701
I said I didn't want to have sex
and that's how you took it.

04:38.735 --> 04:40.569
And you said that you didn't
want to talk either.

04:40.603 --> 04:42.805
If you don't want to talk
and you don't want to have sex,

04:42.839 --> 04:44.640
what else is there
to do in here?

04:44.674 --> 04:47.743
- Do you want to talk?
- I'd rather have sex.

04:47.777 --> 04:49.778
Yeah well, let's talk.

04:49.813 --> 04:54.216
I am so embarrassed
and so humiliated.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.618
As am I.
Horrible things

04:56.653 --> 04:58.754
were written about me
and my workplace.

04:58.788 --> 05:01.857
- Horrible things that you said.
- Just because someone prints it

05:01.891 --> 05:05.494
- doesn't make it true.
- Page seven, second paragraph... is that true?

05:05.528 --> 05:07.896
<i>- You printed it out?
- Read it to me.</i>

05:07.931 --> 05:10.833
- Come on.
- Fine, I'll read it.

05:13.970 --> 05:16.839
"After a staff meeting Ari
threw a stapler at the wall"

05:16.873 --> 05:19.575
and screamed at a fellow Agent
that he needed to 'climb

05:19.609 --> 05:22.244
back inside his mother's vagina
and cook a little longer'"?

05:22.278 --> 05:24.446
That's funny.

05:24.481 --> 05:27.549
Was it also funny that you asked
Lizzie Grant if she signed a client

05:27.584 --> 05:29.151
with a pen or with his cock?

05:29.185 --> 05:31.820
Oh, and to another: "You should blow
me for what I've done for you."

05:31.855 --> 05:35.157
No no no, I remem... I said
that to a man, not to a woman.

05:35.191 --> 05:38.360
I would never say that to a woman.
It is an expression.

05:38.395 --> 05:40.095
But you said these things!

05:40.130 --> 05:42.331
I don't know if I said
all of them.

05:42.365 --> 05:45.801
- You knew the man you married.
- And now the whole world does!

05:45.835 --> 05:48.771
The kids at school, their
parents... my mother!

05:48.805 --> 05:52.007
- So wait, this is about everyone else?
- No, actually. It's about us.

05:52.041 --> 05:55.377
I'd like to ask you how many calls did you
take before mine when all this blew up?

05:55.412 --> 05:58.847
- What? - I held for 10 minutes
and you never called me back!

05:58.882 --> 06:01.717
- I came home.
- Three hours later.

06:01.751 --> 06:04.987
I had to try to do
some damage control.

06:05.021 --> 06:08.056
That's what I can't get over... that you
put more importance on the business

06:08.091 --> 06:09.892
than the people in your family.

06:09.926 --> 06:11.894
Baby, you and the kids
mean everything to me.

06:11.928 --> 06:15.764
Nothing else matters.
You tell me what you want me to do.

06:15.799 --> 06:17.800
Honestly I don't know.

06:27.744 --> 06:30.546
You okay?

06:30.580 --> 06:33.482
- Small headache.
- Told you to slow down last night.

06:33.516 --> 06:35.451
I was trying
to keep up with you.

06:35.485 --> 06:37.453
Well, that's not
going to happen.

06:37.487 --> 06:38.854
I'll be fine.

06:38.888 --> 06:41.457
Vince, I need to talk
to you about something.

06:41.491 --> 06:43.892
Uh-oh.

06:43.927 --> 06:46.361
I got a really big offer.

06:46.396 --> 06:48.630
- For what?
- A film.

06:48.665 --> 06:51.233
- That's great.
- An adult film.

06:53.169 --> 06:55.370
Uh, I thought you weren't
doing that anymore.

06:55.405 --> 06:58.407
No, I haven't been doing it because
I've been getting legit stuff.

06:58.441 --> 07:00.776
And until now I haven't
gotten a good enough offer.

07:00.810 --> 07:03.512
- Well, what are they offering you?
- 200 grand.

07:05.815 --> 07:07.649
Well, you're not gonna do it.

07:07.684 --> 07:09.852
I'm sorry, that sounded like
a demand, not a question.

07:09.886 --> 07:12.521
You're surprised that I don't want
you to fuck another dude on camera?

07:12.555 --> 07:14.389
Are you gonna fuck me on camera?

07:14.424 --> 07:16.258
- Sash...
- Vince, don't worry about it.

07:16.292 --> 07:19.495
It's a five-guy gangbang so nobody
gets any one-on-one time with me.

07:19.529 --> 07:22.064
- You think this is funny?
- Not at all.

07:22.098 --> 07:25.400
- It's the absolute truth.
- All right, I'll give you the money not to do it.

07:25.435 --> 07:28.370
- What?
- Yeah, it's not that big a deal.

07:28.404 --> 07:31.306
- Don't treat me like a whore, Vince.
- I wasn't. I...

07:31.341 --> 07:34.543
- and don't be so aggressive in
telling me what to do. - Calm down.

07:34.577 --> 07:37.145
- I'm just saying.
- I know what you were saying.

07:37.180 --> 07:40.649
But I wasn't asking for your permission.
I was just letting you know.

07:44.153 --> 07:47.089
<i>I thought getting the word out about
Avion would be a good thing.</i>

07:47.123 --> 07:50.626
It would be, if we could
provide the tequila, Turtle.

07:50.660 --> 07:52.995
But we're a small company
that's trying to grow.

07:53.029 --> 07:55.364
And we've gotten an order
for 20,000 cases ever since

07:55.398 --> 07:58.600
- Vince posted on this Twitter two days ago.
- We gotta fill them.

07:58.635 --> 08:02.237
We don't have the capacity.
Our factory can't handle it.

08:02.272 --> 08:05.340
Well, could we expand
the factory maybe?

08:05.375 --> 08:08.544
- Or get a new one.
- Get a new one... we don't have the money.

08:08.578 --> 08:12.147
The plan is to grow starting with Vince's
ad campaign which is still months away.

08:12.181 --> 08:15.083
- How much do you need?
- Whew, our new factory we hope to open

08:15.118 --> 08:17.986
in 2013 will cost
around $5 million.

08:18.021 --> 08:19.955
Carlos, I've seen your house.

08:19.989 --> 08:22.190
You probably have that
hiding under your mattress.

08:22.225 --> 08:24.593
I've barely been able to hold
onto that house, Turtle.

08:24.627 --> 08:26.428
The recession has
hit us all... hard.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.530
But if you can get the money,
you'd expand now?

08:28.565 --> 08:31.066
<i>We would have expanded already
if not for the economy.</i>

08:31.100 --> 08:33.635
Maybe I can get you the money.

08:37.674 --> 08:40.741
Sure, Turtle, but how?
Are you gonna ask Vince for that too?

08:43.413 --> 08:46.315
I can't believe you sent it to the studio
when I told you how much I hate it!

08:46.349 --> 08:48.150
I can't believe you don't
appreciate the fact

08:48.184 --> 08:50.485
that they love it and you
basically have a greenlit show.

08:50.520 --> 08:53.455
Yeah, playing a cartoon monkey!
I want to be seen and not heard.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.757
Hey, would you get off the phone
and come over here and focus?

08:55.792 --> 08:58.360
- Hang on, hang on.
- Drama, this is a job.

08:58.394 --> 09:00.762
<i>- A real job!
- I'm not that desperate, Lloyd.</i>

09:00.797 --> 09:04.399
- What about your mortgage payments?
- I could cover six more.

09:04.434 --> 09:07.135
<i>- Johnny. - Lloyd, I'm working
on my body right now.</i>

09:07.170 --> 09:10.372
My real body. So you two go find
someone who wants to use it.

09:10.406 --> 09:12.474
<i>- Drama!
I'm honestly questioning</i>

09:12.508 --> 09:14.776
whether I'm going to ever work
with either of you guys again.

09:14.811 --> 09:16.745
<i>- Come on, come on.
- Goodbye.</i>

09:16.779 --> 09:19.615
I always imagined that double-teaming
would be more fun than that.

09:19.649 --> 09:21.516
Ew. Talk to you
later, Lloyd.

09:21.551 --> 09:24.753
What, he still don't
want to be a monkey?

09:24.787 --> 09:26.221
It's a gorilla and no.

09:26.255 --> 09:27.956
- What's up?
- We need to talk.

09:27.991 --> 09:30.459
To me?
About what?

09:30.493 --> 09:33.362
About tequila and money.

09:35.665 --> 09:38.634
- It's time for the staff meeting.
- Oh joy.

09:38.668 --> 09:40.869
And what are we
working on today?

09:40.903 --> 09:42.838
Kissing our employees' asses

09:42.872 --> 09:44.873
so no work gets done
and we don't get sued.

09:44.907 --> 09:47.309
- Are you being sarcastic?
- Don't question my tone.

09:47.343 --> 09:50.545
This is coming from a lawyer,
Ari, who we pay a lot money to.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.214
Now be careful or else!

09:52.248 --> 09:54.383
- Sounds like you're threatening me.
- Somebody has to.

09:54.417 --> 09:56.051
You're doing a fine job
today, Jake.

09:56.085 --> 09:58.920
If Dana Gordon calls I'd appreciate
it if you got me immediately.

09:58.955 --> 10:01.390
<i>- Please and thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

10:01.424 --> 10:03.325
Good morning, everyone.

10:03.359 --> 10:05.894
First staff meeting
of the new softer, quieter,

10:05.928 --> 10:08.330
gentler regime.
How is everyone feeling?

10:09.732 --> 10:11.533
Why don't we start the day off
with some hugs and kisses?

10:11.567 --> 10:14.202
Everyone except for you and me, Lloyd.
That ain't happening.

10:14.237 --> 10:17.372
- Ari. - What?
I thought it was very courteous of me

10:17.407 --> 10:19.074
to not want to get him excited.

10:19.108 --> 10:22.644
- Don't make me retain counsel, Ari.
- Anyway...

10:22.679 --> 10:24.913
- Ari, I've got Dana Gordon.
- I must take that.

10:24.947 --> 10:27.683
The good news is everyone knows
how much I hate staff meetings,

10:27.717 --> 10:29.584
so thankfully
there is no chance

10:29.619 --> 10:32.587
of me getting irritated
and saying something bad.

10:32.622 --> 10:34.523
Take it away, babs.

10:36.626 --> 10:39.861
I have to say I'm impressed that I could
get you with everything that's going on.

10:39.896 --> 10:41.797
Dana, you've known me
longer than my wife.

10:41.831 --> 10:43.799
You should know that
I care about my clients,

10:43.833 --> 10:45.701
despite the picture
that is painted of me.

10:45.735 --> 10:48.403
<i>- How is your wife?
- She's not happy.</i>

10:48.438 --> 10:51.173
- Well, she married you.
- Thank you. You would've.

10:51.207 --> 10:53.909
<i>- Oh, don't be absurd.
- Dana, "Deadline Hollywood"</i>

10:53.943 --> 10:56.244
has rendered me no longer able
to flirt, so let's get to it.

10:56.279 --> 10:58.714
Are we sorted out where
Vince is concerned?

10:58.748 --> 11:00.549
- We will be.
- Don't piss me off.

11:00.583 --> 11:03.919
There's no reason to.
I've been assured that Vince doesn't do drugs.

11:03.953 --> 11:06.788
So there'll be no problem
if he submits to a drug test.

11:06.823 --> 11:10.425
That way Wallace and the studio will be
happy and we can move ahead as planned.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.794
- You're joking?
- No, I'm not.

11:12.829 --> 11:14.763
In the history
of asinine requests,

11:14.797 --> 11:16.898
I have never heard one
this asinine, Dana.

11:16.933 --> 11:19.401
It's not asinine.
It's necessary.

11:19.435 --> 11:22.471
So this isn't even a request;
It's a necessity?!

11:22.505 --> 11:25.707
- I'm afraid so. - Wow, you think that
I'm beaten and weak or something?

11:25.742 --> 11:27.876
You know, look, I'd hoped
that you would be reasonable.

11:27.910 --> 11:31.146
<i>Listen, sweetheart, you want to call
and butter me up with sympathy,</i>

11:31.180 --> 11:32.981
and then drop this on me
because you think

11:33.015 --> 11:34.816
that I'm down and will
kowtow to anything,

11:34.851 --> 11:37.953
let me explain this to you in
a metaphor you will understand,

11:37.987 --> 11:41.323
I am sure there are guys who
have fingered you in the ass

11:41.357 --> 11:43.592
long enough that eventually
you let them fuck it.

11:43.626 --> 11:46.261
<i>And now you think you got me bent
over with your finger in my ass,</i>

11:46.295 --> 11:48.163
<i>thinking I'm gonna
let you do the same.</i>

11:48.197 --> 11:50.265
I am not like you, Dana.

11:50.299 --> 11:52.634
You will not fuck me
in the ass!

11:52.668 --> 11:56.471
Vince will not piss in a cup
for you or anyone else!

12:06.349 --> 12:08.150
- She's a porn star.
- She was.

12:08.184 --> 12:11.019
- No, she is. - I think she's
a little bit more than that.

12:11.053 --> 12:14.055
Okay, Vince, these
porn girls, all right,

12:14.090 --> 12:17.793
even if they seem like they're
okay, they're actually broken.

12:17.827 --> 12:19.494
All of them, you know?
And I don't think

12:19.529 --> 12:21.429
you can give her money
in order to control her.

12:21.464 --> 12:24.666
You probably sent her off on an anal
bang bender just to prove you wrong.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.701
No, she's stronger than that.

12:26.736 --> 12:28.336
What does E say?

12:28.371 --> 12:31.973
I don't think Eric Murphy's rules
of dating apply to a porn star.

12:32.008 --> 12:34.743
- What do you say?
- I say lose her.

12:34.777 --> 12:37.946
You're Vinnie chase.
You don't need to be dealing with this shit.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.784
You're right.
You're right.

12:42.819 --> 12:45.053
I'm just trying
to be nice anyway.

12:45.087 --> 12:47.322
Yeah, it's only been a couple weeks, right?
No big deal.

12:47.356 --> 12:50.091
- I mean, less than that.
- That's all.

12:51.994 --> 12:54.830
- But you like her.
- Yeah.

12:54.864 --> 12:57.399
- Jesus, Vince.
- Kinda nuts, right?

12:58.601 --> 13:01.469
- No.
- I just seriously can't handle

13:01.504 --> 13:03.605
a bunch of dudes passing
around my girlfriend.

13:03.639 --> 13:06.641
Yeah, I can imagine.
She really your girlfriend?

13:06.676 --> 13:09.010
Yeah, I guess she is.

13:09.045 --> 13:12.547
Listen, can you get some more of
that stuff from the other night?

13:12.582 --> 13:15.183
I don't want to be the one
getting you drugs, Vince.

13:15.218 --> 13:16.551
Yeah no, of course.

13:16.586 --> 13:18.553
I'll call my weed guy.

13:18.588 --> 13:20.989
First I'm gonna call Sasha.

13:22.525 --> 13:25.393
I'd still like to date one
of her friends. I mean...

13:27.296 --> 13:30.098
- I am not asking for Vince's money.
- So what are you asking for?

13:30.132 --> 13:32.434
I'm asking for you to intro
me to people who have money.

13:32.468 --> 13:34.970
- Who do I know that you don't know?
- What about your boss?

13:35.004 --> 13:37.706
My boss?! I don't want
to get Vince involved in this,

13:37.740 --> 13:39.774
now you're asking me
to get my boss who's also

13:39.809 --> 13:41.977
my fiancee's godfather
to risk his money as well?

13:42.011 --> 13:44.079
There's no risk.
The orders are there.

13:44.113 --> 13:47.115
We need the money to fill the
orders and then everyone gets paid.

13:47.149 --> 13:48.884
Dana Gordon's on the phone.

13:48.918 --> 13:50.986
<i>Can we
finish this up later?</i>

13:51.020 --> 13:53.154
Finish what?
You blowing me off?

13:53.189 --> 13:56.358
I went to Ari last year
for the limo business.

13:56.392 --> 13:58.593
He told me I had no plan
and he wouldn't help.

13:58.628 --> 14:00.929
Now I come to you, my friend,
with a real plan

14:00.963 --> 14:03.431
- and you blow me off.
- I'm not blowing you off, Turtle.

14:03.466 --> 14:06.134
I gotta take this call.
It's about Vince.

14:06.168 --> 14:08.503
Turtle!

14:14.076 --> 14:15.543
- How'd it go?
- Shitty.

14:15.578 --> 14:17.646
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, fuck it.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.548
Last year I went at this half-assed,
but now I got something real,

14:20.583 --> 14:22.450
something people
will thank me for.

14:22.485 --> 14:25.086
- So what are you going to do?
- I'm gonna go back to Ari.

14:25.121 --> 14:27.389
You think
he'll thank you for it?

14:27.423 --> 14:30.191
Eventually.

14:31.093 --> 14:32.661
Alison brod.

14:32.695 --> 14:34.896
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- Name does not sound familiar.

14:34.931 --> 14:36.831
She worked in your lit
department four years ago,

14:36.866 --> 14:38.833
alleges you suggested
she have her cunt removed

14:38.868 --> 14:41.569
- so as to decrease her cuntiness.
- That sounds familiar.

14:41.604 --> 14:44.272
So what, people are just gonna
keep coming out of the woodwork?

14:44.307 --> 14:46.908
Of course, they see a weakness.
It's a chance to make a quick payday

14:46.943 --> 14:49.477
- because they think y don't want to deal.
- I don't want to deal.

14:49.512 --> 14:52.314
The only person who could
successfully sue me is Lloyd,

14:52.348 --> 14:55.250
and he never would.
Now I have bigger problems.

14:55.284 --> 14:57.352
Like my wife.

14:59.355 --> 15:02.290
- Your therapy appointment is in 10 minutes.
- I'm moving as fast as I can.

15:02.325 --> 15:04.125
- Jeffrey Tambor's here.
- I am not here.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.561
- Ari, I need to talk to you.
- I am not here, Jeff.

15:06.595 --> 15:09.664
- Who am I looking at, Ari?
- You picked a real bad day.

15:09.699 --> 15:11.666
I know!
That's why I'm here.

15:11.701 --> 15:14.235
- You're here for me?
- Yes, when a friend is in need...

15:14.270 --> 15:16.037
- listen, I'm not in need.
- How are you?

15:16.072 --> 15:17.672
- I'm fine.
- Really?

15:17.707 --> 15:20.008
- Really I'm fine.
- See, that can't be true.

15:20.042 --> 15:22.844
Because even if you think you're
fine, trust me, you are not.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.613
- Jesus! - Mr. Tambor, I'm sorry,
but Ari's late for an appointment.

15:25.648 --> 15:27.215
- Push it.
- I can't.

15:27.249 --> 15:29.517
Wha-why... what do you mean?
Who are you meeting with?

15:29.552 --> 15:31.119
No one.
None of your business.

15:31.153 --> 15:33.655
- Hey, this is me.
You can tell me. - Jesus.

15:33.689 --> 15:36.358
- Ari! - All right, look, I'm
meeting with my wife, okay?

15:36.392 --> 15:38.326
Therapy... it's an emergency session.

15:38.361 --> 15:41.229
If this was a week ago, I would
flog you with an extension cord!

15:41.263 --> 15:43.665
Oh, you're really hurting.
He doesn't mean that, young man.

15:43.699 --> 15:44.933
- How's your wife, Ari?
- She's fine.

15:44.967 --> 15:46.668
- How is your wife, Ari?
- Jeffrey.

15:46.702 --> 15:48.903
Come on, I am
no stranger to scandal.

15:48.938 --> 15:50.705
What scandal have you
been involved with?

15:50.740 --> 15:53.041
There was that little incident
on "Arrested Development."

15:53.075 --> 15:55.543
If you haven't heard about it,
there's no reason to hear about it.

15:55.578 --> 15:57.679
- I have to go.
- Go, but, you know,

15:57.713 --> 15:59.914
this is a time to be
cautious and caring.

15:59.949 --> 16:03.284
Don't react to your wife.
Remember, you're the one who's done evil.

16:05.287 --> 16:08.023
I don't know what got into me.
I was being an idiot.

16:08.057 --> 16:11.126
- I appreciate the apology.
- I appreciate you accepting.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.395
I'm sorry too.
I snapped,

16:13.429 --> 16:16.031
but the last boyfriend I
had was very controlling.

16:16.065 --> 16:17.699
Well, I'm not controlling.

16:17.733 --> 16:19.868
I got jealous,
but I had no right.

16:19.902 --> 16:22.437
But if you were my boyfriend
you think you would?

16:23.973 --> 16:26.374
How about I promise to prove to
you that I'm your girlfriend

16:26.409 --> 16:29.177
and only care about you,
no matter what I end up doing,

16:29.211 --> 16:31.446
- and you can trust me?
- We can try.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.148
That's a start.

16:33.182 --> 16:35.150
What is all this?

16:35.184 --> 16:37.952
You said you liked
oysters, I got oysters.

16:37.987 --> 16:40.188
- And other stuff.
- Lots of other stuff.

16:40.222 --> 16:41.890
- Thanks, Chris.
- Of course.

16:41.924 --> 16:43.625
I hope you're not trying
to bribe me with all this.

16:43.659 --> 16:45.493
- It isn't going to work.
- We'll see.

16:49.565 --> 16:51.433
- It's E.
- Take it.

16:51.467 --> 16:53.101
I'm going to go wash up.

16:55.471 --> 16:57.072
<i>Vince...</i>

16:57.106 --> 17:00.675
- Hold on, E. - Thanks.
I'm not used to getting apologies.

17:00.709 --> 17:03.178
I'm not used to giving them.

17:03.212 --> 17:05.847
Yo, E, what's up?

17:05.881 --> 17:09.117
Dana Gordon just called me and we
got a little issue.

17:09.151 --> 17:11.886
- What kind of issue?
- The studio wants you to take a drug test.

17:11.921 --> 17:15.423
- Oh, come on. - I think you should
just do it so we can move on.

17:15.458 --> 17:18.358
<i>- What did Ari say?
- He told them to go fuck themselves,</i>

17:18.394 --> 17:20.028
<i>but he's dealing
with his own shit.</i>

17:20.061 --> 17:21.563
This is not a precedent
I want set.

17:21.597 --> 17:24.499
- What if they don't give you a choice?
- I don't know.

17:24.532 --> 17:27.234
<i>- I can't believe this.
- They're not gonna care about weed,</i>

17:27.269 --> 17:29.804
<i>- only the harder stuff.
- Why are you pushing so hard?</i>

17:29.839 --> 17:32.373
I'm not pushing at all.
I just want you to go back to work.

17:32.408 --> 17:34.309
<i>- Well, I'm not doing it.
- Vince.</i>

17:34.343 --> 17:36.778
- E, it's not gonna happen.
- What do you propose I tell them?

17:36.812 --> 17:39.481
<i>- Don't worry about it.
I'll go talk to Dana myself. - Don't...</i>

17:39.515 --> 17:41.616
Hello?

17:41.650 --> 17:43.218
What happened?

17:43.252 --> 17:44.819
Vince is losing his mind.

17:44.854 --> 17:46.855
- He doesn't want to take the test?
- No.

17:46.889 --> 17:49.124
And he said he's
going to see Dana Gordon.

17:49.158 --> 17:51.359
- Well, you have to go too.
- Yeah.

17:52.761 --> 17:55.563
Hey, guys. Hey, bay cities!
Yum yum yum yum.

17:55.598 --> 17:57.432
Well, I gotta take off,
so enjoy.

17:57.466 --> 17:59.634
- What do you hear from Drama?
- He won't budge. I'll work on him.

17:59.668 --> 18:02.737
- I gotta take care of something with Vince first.
- What's wrong with Vince?

18:02.771 --> 18:04.873
The studio thinks
he's on drugs.

18:04.907 --> 18:07.142
Oh.

18:07.176 --> 18:09.177
Oh what?

18:10.913 --> 18:13.047
- Hello?
- I don't want to be a rat.

18:13.082 --> 18:15.650
Speak, Billy!

18:18.888 --> 18:20.889
Vince and your body double
down the hall there

18:20.923 --> 18:23.491
were doing a little sniffle sniffle
at the party the other night.

18:23.526 --> 18:26.094
- Come on, you're lying.
- Just don't let it get back to me.

18:26.128 --> 18:29.230
All I do is try
to avoid conflict.

18:32.935 --> 18:34.602

18:47.716 --> 18:49.851

- Sorry. Nice to meet you.

18:49.885 --> 18:52.587
Hey, it sounds like you guys got
some business to take care of.

18:52.621 --> 18:54.455
No no no, we're good.
Big dog, sit down.

Sit... U.C.L.A. legend, that's all.

18:56.725 --> 18:58.526
I don't give a shit.
Are you fucking kidding me?!

18:58.561 --> 19:01.196
Vince has never done coke a day in his life.
Suddenly you come around,

19:01.230 --> 19:04.666
he's hopping out of planes and showing up
to important meetings out of his mind?

19:04.700 --> 19:07.669
- Wait, that was not my fault. - Really?
Then whose fucking fault was it, Scott?

19:07.703 --> 19:09.771
We've worked way too hard to
bring Vince back from the dead

19:09.805 --> 19:11.639
and you're trying to fuck it up.
Stay away from him!

- Put him through to my cell.

19:26.322 --> 19:28.556
Hey, what's up, Phil?

19:28.591 --> 19:30.458
You tell me...
I've been waiting all day

19:30.492 --> 19:32.594
to hear how excited
John is about the cartoon.

19:32.628 --> 19:35.263
<i>- He's not excited.
- What are you talking about?</i>

19:35.297 --> 19:38.900
<i>- He thinks his real face is being undervalued.
- Are you joking?</i>

19:38.934 --> 19:42.704
- I'm working on him. - And I've been
working for him, Eric, for like six months,

reading every piece of shit
that has come in here.

19:45.507 --> 19:47.709
I know, Phil.
I said I was working on him.

19:47.743 --> 19:51.879
I have fought tooth and nail with
the network to get him his own show

19:51.914 --> 19:54.249
and he needs to be
worked on... really?

19:54.283 --> 19:57.051
<i>- Look, that's just the way Drama is.
- The President of the network</i>

19:57.086 --> 19:59.854
<i>called today. He thinks that this
could be the next "Simpsons."</i>

19:59.888 --> 20:02.624
I've done everything I can for John.
If he's not in, then-then-then...

20:02.658 --> 20:05.793
<i>we have to get someone else.
I have to get someone else.</i>

20:05.828 --> 20:08.696
Uh no, Phil, you won't because
it's my thing. I own it.

20:08.731 --> 20:11.633
And like I said, I'm working on him.
I suggest you do the same.

20:11.667 --> 20:14.502
And don't ever threaten me again!

20:19.742 --> 20:21.776
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:21.810 --> 20:24.245
- Is Ari here?
- Um...

20:24.280 --> 20:27.048
- Who are you?
- I'm Turtle.

20:27.082 --> 20:29.350
- Vince's guy.
- I'm Alex.

20:29.385 --> 20:31.352
- Hi.
- You must be new.

20:31.387 --> 20:33.221
Sort of. But Ari's
not here right now

20:33.255 --> 20:35.523
and I'm not sure how soon
he'll be back, so...

20:35.557 --> 20:37.659
We'll wait.

20:41.597 --> 20:44.699
It just came to me... I
should look at this as a blessing.

20:44.733 --> 20:47.135
"What can I do?" He asks.
So what are all the things

20:47.169 --> 20:49.470
that I have wanted him to do
that I have never said?

20:49.505 --> 20:51.272
It's nice to see you
find your voice.

20:51.307 --> 20:53.641
When has she not had her voice?

20:53.676 --> 20:57.011
I haven't heard this kind of
proactive conviction from her side.

20:57.046 --> 20:59.914
She's always had conviction.
That's why I love her.

20:59.948 --> 21:01.716
- Ha.
- What, do you doubt that?

21:01.750 --> 21:05.620
- Since the merger you've been elsewhere.
- I was very stressed.

21:05.654 --> 21:08.289
- Do you not think he loves you?
- Don't be ridiculous!

21:08.324 --> 21:11.492
- Would you let her answer, please?
- Thank you.

21:11.527 --> 21:14.228
- Yes, I know he loves me, but...
- Wait,

21:14.263 --> 21:16.764
is this about what happened
or about other things?

21:16.799 --> 21:18.866
Sounds like both,
but let her speak.

21:18.901 --> 21:20.368
- Please let me speak!
- Speak.

21:20.402 --> 21:23.471
I know he loves me...

21:23.505 --> 21:26.341
I'm sorry, I thought I had it on vibrate.
I'm sorry.

21:26.375 --> 21:29.911
I know he loves me,
but it's always on his terms.

21:29.945 --> 21:31.979
I'd like to lay out mine.

21:32.014 --> 21:33.981
What are they?

21:34.016 --> 21:37.385
Well, first off,
no blackberries in the house.

21:37.419 --> 21:39.620
Don't be ridiculous.

21:39.655 --> 21:43.124
I knew you'd say that. So my solution
is that people contact your assistant

21:43.158 --> 21:45.660
and then he and only he
may call at the house.

21:45.694 --> 21:47.929
- Will you try that?
- I will try that

21:47.963 --> 21:50.198
if she lets me check
this message right now.

21:50.232 --> 21:52.967
<i>- It must be important.</i>

21:54.837 --> 21:56.404
We can try that.

21:56.438 --> 21:58.005
Fantastic.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.408
And no more promises
you don't keep.

22:00.442 --> 22:03.444
<i>- Let's stay away from the abstract.
- Okay,</i>

22:03.479 --> 22:06.214
if you break another promise
or lie to me, I'll have to...

22:07.850 --> 22:10.518
Seriously reevaluate
our relationship.

22:11.687 --> 22:13.588
<i>Do you hear
what she's saying?</i>

22:13.622 --> 22:16.224
Do you really feel that way?

22:16.258 --> 22:19.127
I do.

22:19.161 --> 22:21.629
I'm sorry, we're going
to have to stop soon. Ari?

22:21.663 --> 22:24.198
Can you respond
to this request?

22:24.233 --> 22:26.834
No, who could?
And fuck you with your fucking clock!

22:26.869 --> 22:28.636
And I want you to work
on your anger too.

22:28.670 --> 22:32.240
- Have you ever tried Lexapro?
- I have begged him to try Zoloft.

22:32.274 --> 22:34.142
Baby, I am who I am,
but I love you.

22:34.176 --> 22:36.744
I don't want to break anymore
promises, so I won't make them.

22:36.779 --> 22:38.946
<i>- Let's think about this.</i>

22:38.981 --> 22:41.182
- Do I get any requests?
- Such as?

22:41.216 --> 22:43.885
- No more therapy!
- I don't think that's wise.

22:43.919 --> 22:46.888
- Will you let her speak?
- Actually,

22:46.922 --> 22:49.424
I think more therapy.
I think twice a week.

22:49.458 --> 22:51.726
<i>- You are not getting off the hook now.
- Okay fine.</i>

22:51.760 --> 22:54.729
Therapy every day if you want.
Hell4 let's have doc move in with us,

22:54.763 --> 22:57.031
but please, let me
check this message.

22:57.065 --> 22:59.033
- Please.
- Fine.

22:59.067 --> 23:02.270
Oh my God, I got mark Cuban in five minutes.
I totally forgot.

23:02.304 --> 23:03.538
I-I-I... I need to go.

23:03.572 --> 23:06.174
- Can I please go?
- Go.

23:07.309 --> 23:08.876
Go.

23:12.815 --> 23:15.016
We'll talk
about this next week.

23:15.050 --> 23:18.085
Vince, we ask lots of our
actors to take drug tests.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.121
Actors with no history
of drug use?

23:20.155 --> 23:21.622
No arrests?

23:21.657 --> 23:23.991
What's the deal here?
I thought we had a good relationship.

23:24.026 --> 23:26.694
We do, Vince. And you're going to
make a ton of money for the studio.

23:26.728 --> 23:28.596
So just take the drug test.
You'll pass it

23:28.630 --> 23:30.598
and then we can put the
whole thing behind us.

23:30.632 --> 23:34.302
I've never missed a day of work, never
caused any production problems.

23:34.336 --> 23:37.538
- That should be good enough.
- For me it is.

23:37.573 --> 23:41.242
- But our director wants more.
- No offense, but that's his problem.

23:41.276 --> 23:44.245
Dana, I appreciate all you've
done for me in the past,

23:44.279 --> 23:47.915
but I'm not taking a drug test and I
don't want to be asked again about it.

23:47.950 --> 23:50.418
If my word isn't good enough
for you guys,

23:50.452 --> 23:52.720
find someone else
whose word is.

23:52.754 --> 23:55.890
- Hey, how are you, mark?
- I'm good. Is Ari ready?

23:55.924 --> 23:58.326
- Ari's not here right now.
- You're kidding, right?

23:58.360 --> 24:01.162
No, but he'll be back
in less than five.

24:01.196 --> 24:03.264
We're wheels up in 90 minutes.

24:03.298 --> 24:05.199
We'll wait five minutes,
no longer.

24:05.234 --> 24:07.869
Okay, just have a seat.
Do you want anything to drink, or...

24:07.903 --> 24:09.871
- No thanks.
- I'll have a water.

24:09.905 --> 24:12.240
- You got it.
- What?

24:12.274 --> 24:14.408
- What the hell?
- Hey, mark, Turtle.

24:14.443 --> 24:16.644
I met you at the all-star game
last year with Vincent chase.

24:16.678 --> 24:20.147
Oh yeah. I saw what you posted on
Vince's Twitter account, dude.

24:20.182 --> 24:22.250
Oh, you did?
I didn't mean to upload that.

24:22.284 --> 24:24.685
Actually I liked it.
It wasn't bad.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.454
Is this a real business
Vince has got?

24:26.488 --> 24:28.155
It could be
with a little push.

24:28.190 --> 24:30.458
We're just starting to put
the funding together now.

24:30.492 --> 24:32.159
This is my business
partner Ken austin...

24:32.194 --> 24:33.895
he's in charge of funding.

24:33.929 --> 24:37.398
- Do you like tequila, Ken?
- I'd have to hear more about it.

24:37.432 --> 24:41.035
- And taste it.
- Mark, mark, I'm so sorry.

24:41.069 --> 24:43.471
Traffic, flat tire, shooting.
Hey, Ken.

24:43.505 --> 24:45.373
- How are you?
- It's all right, Ari.

24:45.407 --> 24:47.475
I'm actually glad I got
to meet these two.

24:47.509 --> 24:50.344
I'm flying up to Sacramento.
I'm doing a trade with the kings.

24:50.379 --> 24:52.747
Why don't you guys come along?
You can tell me more about it.

24:52.781 --> 24:55.883
- Anyone want to tell me more about it?
- If you're needed, Ari.

24:55.918 --> 24:57.752
Be at Van Nuys in 90.

24:57.786 --> 25:00.855
It's the big 757... Just look for
the Dallas Mavericks logo. Cool?

25:00.889 --> 25:02.990
- All right, can't miss that.
- Absolutely.

25:03.025 --> 25:04.825
And thank you, Ari.

25:04.860 --> 25:07.028
- Bring a couple bottles, Turtle.
- Will do.

25:07.062 --> 25:09.163
- Bottles of what?
- This could be good.

25:09.197 --> 25:11.032
Don't say I never
take you anywhere.

25:11.066 --> 25:13.701
- What's going on?
- Don't worry about it, Ari.

25:13.735 --> 25:15.836
Let's talk content partners.

25:21.543 --> 25:23.377
- Dana.
- Oh, Eric.

25:23.412 --> 25:25.780
- You just missed Vince.
- Shit. Really? How'd it go?

25:25.814 --> 25:29.350
- He was very aggressive.
- Yeah well, he doesn't want to take the test.

25:29.384 --> 25:31.352
- That's what he said.
- Dana, he's fine.

25:31.386 --> 25:33.654
Don't worry.
I'm gonna go to bat for him.

25:33.689 --> 25:36.223
But our director isn't.
He's quitting.

25:36.258 --> 25:38.459
- Randall?
- Yep.

25:40.095 --> 25:42.797
- So what now?
- Maybe Vince can call James Cameron.

25:42.831 --> 25:44.832
'Cause we need someone big.

25:46.868 --> 25:49.437
There's a couple of parts in this
movie I think you'd be good for.

25:49.471 --> 25:51.639
- What did the studio lady say?
- I haven't asked her yet

25:51.673 --> 25:53.541
'cause I wanted to see
if it was okay with you.

25:53.575 --> 25:56.243
- I don't want any favors.
- No favors.

25:56.278 --> 25:58.212
I think you're great.

25:58.246 --> 26:00.581
And you think this will stop
me from doing the other thing.

26:00.616 --> 26:03.384
- No no, I... - Vince, if I
don't do this 'cause of you,

26:03.418 --> 26:07.121
it's... I just don't want any
anger or regrets towards you.

26:07.155 --> 26:10.791
- Then you'll do it.
- You're supportive?

26:10.826 --> 26:12.960
- I'm trying.
- You'll come to set with me?

26:12.995 --> 26:15.763
I don't think so.

26:15.797 --> 26:18.366
Get me a part
with really cool superpowers

26:18.400 --> 26:19.867
and maybe I won't do it.

26:19.901 --> 26:22.003
Oh yeah? What kind of
superpowers would you want?

26:22.037 --> 26:24.171
I want to be able
to swallow anything.

26:24.206 --> 26:26.574
Pfft! You're nuts.

26:26.608 --> 26:29.110
You like it.

26:30.979 --> 26:32.947
- Yo, e!
- Yo.

26:32.981 --> 26:35.483
- Why didn't you call me back?
- Uh, 'cause I'm swimming

26:35.517 --> 26:37.551
and Turtle broke
the waterproof phone.

26:37.586 --> 26:40.221
- Are you pissed at me about something?
- Yeah, I spoke to Lavin.

26:40.255 --> 26:42.023
- He said you screamed at him.
- Fuck Lavin.

26:42.057 --> 26:43.724
Are you gonna come out
of the pool so we can talk?

26:43.759 --> 26:45.459
- Are you gonna calm down?
- I'm calm.

26:45.494 --> 26:47.795
- Well, then I'll meet you inside.
- Inside?

26:49.331 --> 26:50.898
I'm naked.

26:52.167 --> 26:54.235
- It wasn't Scott's coke.
- I don't give a fuck.

26:54.269 --> 26:56.604
He works for you, he shouldn't
be doing blow with you.

26:56.638 --> 26:58.906
Oh, now he works for me.
You keep telling me he doesn't.

26:58.940 --> 27:00.675
- Are you serious?
- Are you?

27:00.709 --> 27:04.011
- Who's coke was it then, Vince?
Sasha's? - Don't go there.

27:04.046 --> 27:06.113
Go where?
You're in a free fall.

27:06.148 --> 27:09.150
You're showing up at meetings high.
You're dating a porn star.

27:09.184 --> 27:11.786
You know, I was waiting for this
little naive judgment to come out.

27:11.820 --> 27:13.387
Naive?
She's not a porn star?

27:13.422 --> 27:16.057
- E. - Does she not have
sex on camera for money?

27:16.091 --> 27:17.992
All of us in this town
do on some level,

27:18.026 --> 27:19.593
but I'm telling you get off it.

27:19.628 --> 27:21.362
It wasn't her coke, all right?

27:21.396 --> 27:23.164
It was some girl
and she was here

27:23.198 --> 27:24.965
and she had it and I did it.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.635
- And honestly, I've done it before.
- Really?

27:27.669 --> 27:29.303
Really.
Just not around you

27:29.337 --> 27:31.005
because I don't want
to hear this shit.

27:31.039 --> 27:34.175
Oh, Vince, gimme a break.
You showed up to a meeting high on cocaine.

27:34.209 --> 27:36.210
So don't try to act
like I'm some nag.

27:36.244 --> 27:38.612
<i>- That was stupid.
- Oh really? You think so?</i>

27:38.647 --> 27:40.915
I was exhausted and Billy
got me all insecure.

27:40.949 --> 27:42.983
Yeah well, now you got
the studio insecure.

27:43.018 --> 27:45.086
No, I talked to Dana.
She's fine.

27:45.120 --> 27:47.221
- I spoke to her also.
- And?

27:47.255 --> 27:50.725
She is fine.
But Randall quit.

27:50.759 --> 27:52.493
Come on.

27:54.262 --> 27:56.564
Well, he's a fucking asshole
for telling them that.

27:56.598 --> 28:00.067
Look, E, I will deliver on this
movie and it will be great.

28:00.102 --> 28:03.003
- Okay.
- I'm serious... I am fine.

28:03.038 --> 28:05.439
I said okay.

28:05.474 --> 28:08.809
- I think you owe Lavin an apology.
- That's never gonna happen.

28:08.844 --> 28:11.412
- And Sasha.
- She didn't hear any of this.

28:11.446 --> 28:13.781
And as my manager I want
you to call the studio

28:13.815 --> 28:16.484
and find out if there's a
role in "Air-walker" for her.

28:16.518 --> 28:18.586
- Are you serious?
- Oh, I'm serious.

28:19.921 --> 28:22.256
Get it done.
