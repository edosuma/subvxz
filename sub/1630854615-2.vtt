WEBVTT

00:56.389 --> 00:58.641
If you're alive, make some noise!

01:00.602 --> 01:01.728
You're alive!

01:51.861 --> 01:53.279
Uh…

01:55.990 --> 01:57.909
What was our, uh, score today?

01:58.743 --> 02:00.078
Five hundred points.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.663
-Five hundred? That's high.
-Whoa.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.623
Maki only earned three.

02:03.706 --> 02:07.001
-I'm worth at least five.
-That's hilarious.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.002
Brutal.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.464
Hell of a show though, huh? We crushed it.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.883
-The crowd was really into it.
-Yeah.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.178
Okay, listen up.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.848
-Listening.
-We need today's driver, yeah?

02:20.431 --> 02:22.725
-We'll point at them on three.
-Yeah?

02:22.809 --> 02:23.852
-You point.
-Point?

02:23.935 --> 02:25.436
-Yeah, on three. Shit.
-Okay.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.272
-Whoever did the worst today.
-Yeah.

02:27.355 --> 02:28.815
-Right?
-Okay.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.151
-On three.
-I know who I'm picking.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.652
-You ready?
-Sure.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.446
-Let's…
-Okay!

02:35.530 --> 02:37.240
One, two--

02:50.336 --> 02:52.505
We're the citizens of this country.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.467
Citizens?

02:56.551 --> 02:58.136
Sure. Citizens.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.138
What do you mean?

03:00.221 --> 03:01.723
We're all living here, right?

03:02.307 --> 03:03.391
Who can say?

03:05.977 --> 03:07.687
In this place, I'm the leader.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.773
We created this game.

03:10.857 --> 03:14.277
That man, Shitara? All his idea.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.072
Well, to be fair,
this is a brand-new experience for us.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.617
We haven't played a game of it yet
as a team.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.914
What does that mean?
We're competing against citizens now?

03:25.997 --> 03:27.540
Us against the five of you?

03:27.624 --> 03:28.583
Yeah.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.211
When you play a face card game,

03:31.294 --> 03:34.214
you're competing against citizens
fighting for their lives.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.591
Anyone who loses is killed.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.092
So…

03:39.469 --> 03:43.139
these are games of life or death
for us citizens as well.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.019
It's time to begin.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.773
The game we'll be playing is…

03:53.691 --> 03:56.069
<i>Difficulty, King of Clubs.</i>

03:56.778 --> 03:57.779
<i>Game…</i>

03:58.947 --> 04:00.114
<i>Osmosis.</i>

04:02.116 --> 04:04.118
Osmosis…

05:21.654 --> 05:23.323
Now, the rules are simple.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.577
The game lasts two hours.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.829
Both teams try to collect points.

05:29.912 --> 05:33.124
The team with the highest total
at the end of the game wins.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.462
Each team begins with 10,000 points.

05:37.545 --> 05:41.382
Players divide these points
amongst themselves before the game begins.

05:42.967 --> 05:45.428
The minimum amount is 100 points.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.056
You're free to divide them up
any way you want.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.266
Talk it over as a team and decide.

05:51.392 --> 05:55.396
Points distribution is a key element
of strategy in this game.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.944
How does one earn points?

06:02.820 --> 06:05.823
There are three ways
you can do so in this game.

06:06.574 --> 06:10.787
Battle, items, and base.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.163
Hold on!

06:12.663 --> 06:13.915
Yeah, you got a question?

06:14.582 --> 06:16.501
How do we remember all this?

06:16.584 --> 06:18.294
Right.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.339
I guess it's easier once you do it, huh?

06:21.422 --> 06:24.592
A demonstration.
You've got random points for now.

06:25.676 --> 06:28.763
Your bracelet shows
your individual points.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.058
Let's try a battle.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.227
ARISU

06:34.310 --> 06:38.147
A battle's outcome depends entirely
on your current points.

06:38.731 --> 06:42.485
To initiate one,
all you need to do is touch your opponent.

06:42.568 --> 06:43.694
Hey!

06:47.323 --> 06:50.535
NIRAGI 2,000
KYUMA 3,500

06:50.618 --> 06:52.829
Whoever has more points wins.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.832
The winner steals 500 points
from the loser.

07:02.380 --> 07:05.716
<i>The scores have been updated.</i>

07:10.179 --> 07:13.891
The King of Clubs team
is now leading by 1,000 points.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.359
ARISU

07:23.443 --> 07:26.362
So you don't know
your opponent's score until you battle.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.906
No. You know what that means, right?

07:28.990 --> 07:31.200
It means these battles are a huge gamble,

07:31.284 --> 07:33.828
where you're unable
to see your opponent's strength.

07:33.911 --> 07:37.331
Something else you can try
is to pair up with a teammate.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.417
For example…

07:40.585 --> 07:43.045
You two. Try holding hands.

07:47.884 --> 07:51.053
Oh wow, what's this?
A bit nervous, are ya?

08:03.399 --> 08:05.401
Would you look at that? Cute couple.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.990
All right.
If teammates hold hands like this,

08:11.073 --> 08:13.618
they're able to battle
using their combined points,

08:13.701 --> 08:16.871
allowing them to beat an opponent
they couldn't defeat on their own.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.711
The winners get the 500
divided between them.

08:27.924 --> 08:28.925
Cuties.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.302
On to items!

08:31.886 --> 08:33.763
ITEM

08:34.347 --> 08:38.935
There are items for you to find, six
of them, hidden amongst the containers.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.563
Ugh, this area's huge!

08:42.647 --> 08:45.816
There are only six items
in all these shipping containers?

08:45.900 --> 08:49.153
Touching an item
will earn your team some points.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.739
And finally, we come to these poles.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.991
Bases are a big part of the game.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.952
They can turn the tide.

08:59.997 --> 09:04.252
This pole is your base.
Ours is on the other side.

09:04.335 --> 09:05.378
BASE

09:06.796 --> 09:09.590
If you manage to touch
your opponents' base,

09:10.716 --> 09:12.301
10,000 points are yours.

09:12.385 --> 09:16.305
10,000 points?
Don't both teams start with that?

09:16.389 --> 09:20.226
Exactly why you need to keep someone back
to protect your base.

09:20.309 --> 09:25.189
But while a player is touching
their own base, they have infinite points.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.191
Infinite?

09:28.526 --> 09:31.070
How do you battle someone
with infinite points?

09:34.657 --> 09:35.783
Come here.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.427
ARISU 2,250
KYUMA INFINITE

09:54.510 --> 09:58.180
I was touching my base,
so you lose 10,000 points.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.557
ARISU -7,750
KYUMA 3,500

09:59.640 --> 10:01.267
And I gain 10,000.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.396
ARISU -7,750
KYUMA 13,500

10:05.980 --> 10:07.106
Hang on…

10:08.149 --> 10:09.859
So what would happen to him?

10:09.942 --> 10:12.028
His score would have dropped below zero.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.863
Pyeeow.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.406
Shot down.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.870
If you try to touch the other team's base

10:21.454 --> 10:25.875
and their goalie manages to touch you,
you lose 10,000 points.

10:27.043 --> 10:31.505
You die, and the opposing team
gains 10,000 points?

10:32.840 --> 10:34.050
That's way too risky.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.802
If you pull it off,
you can change everything.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.766
Something else.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.519
After completing a battle
or touching the other team's base,

10:45.603 --> 10:47.271
players are temporarily out of commission.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.272
INACTIVE

10:48.356 --> 10:51.192
During this time, their points are frozen.
They're immune.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.070
If you touch an opponent
while they're out of commission…

10:55.863 --> 10:58.532
…your wristband will give you
an electric shock.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.702
Enough to knock you out, so be careful.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.121
Once you touch your own base,

11:04.205 --> 11:07.166
your status is reset
and you can resume play.

11:10.461 --> 11:15.341
So, you know the rules. Split up
your points now, then the game begins.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.348
Hold on.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.104
I'm Arisu.

11:30.064 --> 11:30.981
Kyuma…

11:32.775 --> 11:35.820
tell me something, before we fight.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.658
If we beat all the games here,

11:43.035 --> 11:44.745
will we go back to our world?

11:48.791 --> 11:51.502
Your world? What is your world?

11:53.629 --> 11:55.673
The way that you're speaking about it,

11:57.299 --> 12:00.636
you're making it sound
like your world must be the real one.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.432
What are you talking about?

12:05.808 --> 12:06.976
Tell me something.

12:07.476 --> 12:10.563
How many real conversations did you have?

12:10.646 --> 12:12.857
How many heart-to-hearts did you have?

12:14.233 --> 12:16.402
Our flaws, our pride.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.156
Those are exposed here, in this world.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.076
When we look death in the eye,

12:24.910 --> 12:27.705
we face true human nature and reality.

12:32.918 --> 12:36.046
This world is more real
than any you left behind.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.883
These games are conversations.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.802
Let's really talk, you and I.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.430
Let us expose our true hearts.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.431
Arisu.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.018
You want the truth, yeah?

12:50.102 --> 12:52.271
Face me with everything you have.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.701
All right, then.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.497
I'll play your game.

13:19.423 --> 13:23.010
Is it just me,
or was Kyuma being nice to us?

13:23.093 --> 13:24.553
Just like a normal guy.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.681
Buck naked and crazy. Yeah, real normal.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.184
This game'll be a bloodbath,
just like all the others.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.145
Okay.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.606
Let's distribute the points.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.859
How many do we each get? Got any ideas?

13:41.362 --> 13:42.363
Split 'em five ways, no?

13:42.446 --> 13:45.115
We're not going to win
splitting them evenly between us.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.119
Usagi's right.

13:49.787 --> 13:53.332
It's like Kyuma said.
It's an important decision for the game.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.125
The initial point split is crucial.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.378
You got a plan or what?

14:05.761 --> 14:07.721
<i>Game start.</i>

14:25.614 --> 14:27.741
Whooooo!

14:41.046 --> 14:42.464
<i>Here's the plan.</i>

14:42.548 --> 14:44.925
<i>The faster runners get fewer points.</i>

14:45.593 --> 14:47.720
<i>Slower runners get more.</i>

14:49.972 --> 14:53.350
<i>The guard at the base</i>
<i>gets the least number of points possible.</i>

14:54.935 --> 14:58.772
<i>We go out in pairs,</i>
<i>one fast runner with one slower runner.</i>

14:59.773 --> 15:01.901
Why'd you pair up with me, anyway?

15:02.401 --> 15:03.986
You like me that much, huh?

15:04.069 --> 15:06.864
Please. Because I won't care
if you die in front of me.

15:08.824 --> 15:11.118
<i>Pairing up for battles</i>
<i>has many advantages,</i>

15:11.201 --> 15:14.830
<i>but one of the biggest</i>
<i>is they can only see your combined points.</i>

15:14.914 --> 15:17.499
<i>They won't know</i>
<i>how many points you each have.</i>

15:31.847 --> 15:33.891
We've got 5,000 between us.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.559
He won't have more than that.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.937
They'd be crazy
to give one person half their points.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.565
-Let's get him.
-Yeah, let's get it done.

15:49.448 --> 15:50.824
Uh-oh…

15:54.453 --> 15:55.412
Huh?

15:57.331 --> 15:59.375
Guess he didn't have that many after all.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.013
Nothing here either.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.643
No. Come on.

16:24.775 --> 16:28.570
Hey. Why'd you pair up Usagi with Niragi?

16:28.654 --> 16:29.571
Strategy.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.324
What's going on with you two?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.076
What do you mean?

16:35.160 --> 16:36.245
Arisu…

16:37.830 --> 16:40.457
If something's changed
between you and Usagi,

16:40.541 --> 16:41.959
shouldn't you tell us?

16:42.960 --> 16:45.129
No, we're fine. It's fine, okay?

16:46.755 --> 16:48.007
If you say so.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.637
Oh!

16:53.721 --> 16:55.055
Is that an item?

17:13.741 --> 17:16.160
KUINA
ITEM

17:21.457 --> 17:22.499
2,000 points!

17:23.375 --> 17:24.251
Awesome!

17:25.794 --> 17:26.962
-Yes!
-Yes!

17:27.046 --> 17:30.174
<i>The player team</i>
<i>has secured an item.</i>

17:30.257 --> 17:34.428
<i>The player team is now leading</i>
<i>by 2,000 points.</i>

17:34.511 --> 17:37.097
-We're winning!
-Yeah, that's pretty cool!

17:40.142 --> 17:41.310
Congratulations.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.484
Look, we can't avoid each other forever.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.777
You wanna battle or what?

17:52.446 --> 17:53.864
ARISU

17:53.947 --> 17:55.866
KUINA

18:09.922 --> 18:11.590
Stay close, Arisu.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.718
It's two on one. We'll take it slow.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.553
Yeah.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.642
I couldn't help but overhear.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.644
Sounds like there's an issue.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.313
You're fighting
with one of your teammates.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.113
Arisu,

18:36.031 --> 18:37.866
you have a certain strength about you.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.161
The look of someone who has faced death.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.789
A man will do whatever it takes.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.333
That's why it's so strange.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.670
Your confidence…
Why on earth would it be shaken now?

18:54.675 --> 18:56.760
The five of us were in a band before.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.763
Sometimes we would disagree,

19:00.430 --> 19:02.683
and yet they'd be behind me
at the end of the day.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.812
And so…
I learned something about being a leader.

19:07.896 --> 19:10.649
You can't push people
into following you for no reason.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.777
You have to be ready to listen.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.571
Wait for them to come to you.

19:17.197 --> 19:20.909
Do that,
and they'll know they can depend on you.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.250
Now,

19:29.459 --> 19:30.544
let's go.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.678
Don't hesitate! Not today!

19:40.179 --> 19:43.223
We could die. We all could.
Me, my friends, and you.

19:43.307 --> 19:44.224
Arisu.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.728
Let's not end our lives with regret.

19:47.811 --> 19:48.896
If you're gonna die,

19:49.771 --> 19:52.232
wouldn't you rather give it
everything you've got?

20:06.246 --> 20:07.289
Arisu?

20:09.666 --> 20:10.667
Kyuma.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.253
You said that

20:14.129 --> 20:18.300
to learn the truth, I have to face you
with everything I've got.

20:19.426 --> 20:20.302
Yeah.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.681
I wanna learn more about who you are.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.434
So battle me alone, Kyuma.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.816
Arisu?

20:39.321 --> 20:40.530
You've got it.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.964
ARISU 4,600
KYUMA 2,000

20:57.047 --> 20:58.882
Gah!

20:58.966 --> 21:01.593
-<i>The scores have been updated.</i>
-I lost!

21:01.677 --> 21:03.470
2,000 points?

21:03.553 --> 21:06.265
<i>The player team is now leading</i>
<i>by 3,000 points.</i>

21:06.348 --> 21:07.849
ARISU INACTIVE

21:10.852 --> 21:11.979
Wait a sec.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.314
Did you give everyone equal points?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.734
Yeah, everyone got 2,000.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.696
I thought this was
a game of life or death.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.117
Here's what I think.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.744
My four teammates and I are equals.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.913
We live or die together.

21:33.875 --> 21:37.587
So, Arisu,
did you learn something just now?

22:06.241 --> 22:07.159
Oh!

22:14.708 --> 22:16.043
Ha!

22:16.126 --> 22:17.794
Ah! You got me!

22:17.878 --> 22:18.795
Gah!

22:18.879 --> 22:22.382
-Yeah!
-<i>The scores have been updated.</i>

22:22.466 --> 22:27.220
<i>The player team is now leading</i>
<i>by 4,000 points.</i>

22:28.680 --> 22:29.639
Okay.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.161
<i>The scores have been updated.</i>

22:51.244 --> 22:53.413
-Yes!
-<i>The player team is leading…</i>

22:53.497 --> 22:54.956
I'm sorry.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.213
All right, you guys!

23:01.922 --> 23:03.548
Things are going great so far.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.676
This is a King game? Don't make me laugh.

23:06.760 --> 23:07.928
-Yeah!
-Hah!

23:08.011 --> 23:09.388
Yeah! Yeah!

23:09.471 --> 23:10.931
Pretty crazy to think…

23:11.014 --> 23:13.809
But I almost forgot
you're one of the bad guys, Niragi.

23:13.892 --> 23:14.726
Huh.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.702
ARISU

23:32.786 --> 23:34.371
Well, what'd you learn?

23:35.080 --> 23:37.874
-They split the points evenly.
-Evenly? Are you sure?

23:37.958 --> 23:40.419
2,000 each, yup.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.839
We need to keep the pressure on.
And find more items if we can.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.424
-Right.
-Yeah.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.509
Tatta, you got this, buddy.

23:48.802 --> 23:49.845
Thanks.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.652
They're up by 5,000. I can't believe it.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.946
This is absolute bullshit!

24:08.738 --> 24:10.991
So, what do we do, o leader? Huh?

24:12.742 --> 24:14.077
They're certainly not bad.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.745
Huh? Oh, this is funny to you?

24:16.413 --> 24:20.208
Splitting the points up evenly
was your plan, Kyuma. You figure it out!

24:20.292 --> 24:21.877
Hey, chill out, dude.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.380
This isn't some dictatorship.
He didn't decide for us.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.300
We did it together.

24:28.383 --> 24:31.803
Just like we've always done,
and just like we're going to keep doing.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.930
Absolutely!

24:34.014 --> 24:35.098
So what do we do?

24:35.849 --> 24:36.808
Yo, Maki!

24:38.143 --> 24:39.436
Yeah, man, we all heard you.

24:39.519 --> 24:40.979
So why don't you say something?

24:43.064 --> 24:44.816
I do have one idea.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.861
Me too. I've got an idea,

24:47.944 --> 24:49.863
if you don't mind something crazy.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.993
How funny would it be
if it was the same idea?

24:55.869 --> 24:58.205
Well, how about if we say it on three?

24:58.288 --> 24:59.331
Let's go.

25:01.082 --> 25:02.334
One, two…

25:06.546 --> 25:09.674
<i>The player team has secured an item.</i>

25:10.425 --> 25:15.013
<i>The player team is now leading</i>
<i>by 6,000 points.</i>

25:15.931 --> 25:16.973
Yes!

25:33.031 --> 25:34.157
Hey.

26:03.478 --> 26:04.813
Why are you all here?

26:04.896 --> 26:07.107
We're here so we can win, man.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.669
TATTA
INFINITE

26:30.839 --> 26:31.715
You…

26:32.632 --> 26:33.633
I've got…

26:34.217 --> 26:35.510
I've got infinite points!

26:40.473 --> 26:41.975
You get tagged here…

26:43.977 --> 26:44.936
and you'll die!

26:50.108 --> 26:51.192
You're right.

26:52.027 --> 26:54.321
And since it's a game of life or death,

26:55.363 --> 26:57.574
why don't you tell us
who dies by your hand?

26:59.034 --> 27:02.245
What? But you'll be killed!

27:04.122 --> 27:05.040
You'll die!

27:06.708 --> 27:07.792
Stay back!

27:11.171 --> 27:12.047
No! Don't!

27:17.761 --> 27:18.970
Ah! Ah!

27:22.223 --> 27:24.851
<i>The scores have been updated.</i>

<i>The King of Club team</i>

27:33.360 --> 27:34.611
They overtook us.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.405
What the hell?

27:39.032 --> 27:41.534
<i>One player</i>
<i>on the King of Clubs team</i>

27:41.618 --> 27:44.120
<i>has had their score fall below zero.</i>

27:53.797 --> 27:55.006
You picked me?

28:06.476 --> 28:08.103
You better use this to win.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.648
If I die in vain, I'm…

28:12.524 --> 28:16.361
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you
in the afterlife, man.

28:16.444 --> 28:19.197
<i>It is game over for the player.</i>

28:25.328 --> 28:26.371
Shitara.

28:27.664 --> 28:28.957
You were my good friend.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.668
I'll never forget what you did for us.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.550
Later, man.

29:08.538 --> 29:09.789
Shitara.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.202
Shitara.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.642
They sacrificed a member of their team.

30:12.227 --> 30:14.896
Now three of them have 10,000 points each.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.024
Couldn't even guard one pole, huh?

30:18.107 --> 30:19.651
Fucking useless.

30:19.734 --> 30:22.195
Trash is always gonna be trash.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.863
You piece of shit!

30:23.947 --> 30:27.492
-Lay off of him. He did the best he could.
-The best he could?

30:28.076 --> 30:31.079
You get a chance to kill one of them,
obviously you kill Kyuma!

30:31.162 --> 30:33.122
It's not that. We underestimated them.

30:33.623 --> 30:37.710
He was nice and we got sucked in,
so we forgot the most important thing.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.712
Kyuma is the King of Clubs.

30:39.796 --> 30:42.507
We forgot
that we're gambling with our lives.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.552
They're prepared to die.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.637
They've just shown us that.

30:48.721 --> 30:51.099
If we don't do something,
we're all finished.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.691
Only one hour left on the clock.

31:02.777 --> 31:05.113
We can turn this around
if we attack their base.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.407
We can't get to their base
if they're defending it.

31:07.490 --> 31:10.785
-Yeah, Niragi's right.
-Then how do we win this thing?

31:11.494 --> 31:16.207
Split up again.
Forget battling. Items are the key.

31:16.791 --> 31:19.127
That's the only way
we're getting out of this alive.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.337
Come on. Hurry!

31:44.611 --> 31:48.114

You alone?

32:57.100 --> 32:59.143
Let's do this, you and me.

33:00.853 --> 33:02.313
You ought to know

33:02.397 --> 33:03.898
I'm making you work for this.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.240
All I need is one punch.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.742
You win this battle,

Sorry!

34:12.592 --> 34:14.343
Snooze, you lose.

34:19.682 --> 34:21.267
Yes! 3,000!

34:21.768 --> 34:23.770
The most valuable item.

34:26.564 --> 34:27.982
What the hell?

34:28.066 --> 34:29.442
If you're both here, then…

34:30.860 --> 34:31.778
Wait.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.781
There's no one guarding your base?

34:34.864 --> 34:35.740
Nope.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.077
We figured that you wouldn't have
the guts to invade ours.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.870
And we were right, weren't we?

34:43.122 --> 34:44.707
I can't believe this.

34:48.836 --> 34:51.297
You told me
you wanted answers, Arisu.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.719
The games are cruel. You know that.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.556
The value of a single life
is meaningless here.

35:01.432 --> 35:02.266
Look at me.

35:03.309 --> 35:04.936
I just lost my best friend.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.940
His name was Shitara.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.275
He was my bandmate.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.654
We used to live in this dirty apartment.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.699
The venues we played at were small.

35:19.867 --> 35:21.744
Certainly not the stuff of legends.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.163
But we had fun.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.131
By choosing to join this game,

35:34.632 --> 35:37.426
you get to know
who the other players truly are.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.471
It bares their souls.

35:42.515 --> 35:43.724
Like music does.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.186
Maybe I…

35:48.771 --> 35:51.983
just wanted to expose
people's true humanity.

35:56.904 --> 35:59.782

-We've got to find more items.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.485
It's not worth it.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.612
There's only a few left.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.739
We have to do something!

37:22.240 --> 37:24.700
I'm not sitting here waiting to die.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.953
Tatta still has
over 10,000 points.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.997
-We could pair up and battle--
-Fuck that!

37:31.040 --> 37:33.251
Whose fault is it
we're in this position now?

37:33.793 --> 37:37.171

37:38.631 --> 37:40.758
Ah, it doesn't matter anyway.

37:41.384 --> 37:45.221
We can't make up 12,000 points
with little 500-point battles.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.842
Show me what you're made of, Arisu.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.766
We have to attack their base.

38:32.768 --> 38:33.769
What?

38:34.770 --> 38:38.232
Two of us get 20,000 points
from their base.

38:38.941 --> 38:41.527
-We can still win.
-We can't, man, no!

38:42.069 --> 38:44.280
I was there when they attacked us.

38:44.363 --> 38:45.573
It's impossible.

38:45.656 --> 38:48.826
-What makes you think we can pull it off?
-That's just it.

38:49.785 --> 38:51.620
We have to stop being afraid.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.622
Believe in the plan.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.625
What are you talking about?

38:56.709 --> 38:58.836
The difference between us and them

38:59.378 --> 39:01.339
is whether we let our fear stop us.

39:02.131 --> 39:05.343
We break free, and we push the fear out!

39:07.261 --> 39:09.221
It's too risky. I can't do it.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.850
I won't throw our lives away like that.

39:13.684 --> 39:17.063
But if we don't go,
then we're dead, and that's it.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.982
If we want to win, we have to take a risk.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.568
You're my teammates.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.445
And my friends.

39:25.154 --> 39:27.156
I don't want any of us to die.

39:27.239 --> 39:29.867
But I would risk my life

39:30.993 --> 39:32.661
to be able to save yours.

39:34.622 --> 39:35.831
Well, I'm in.

39:41.337 --> 39:43.672
Not because of all this mushy shit.

39:44.298 --> 39:45.216
It's more.

39:46.008 --> 39:49.512
I'm not the kind of guy
to ever let fear get in my way.

39:55.184 --> 39:56.227
I wanna win.

39:59.063 --> 40:01.107
I can't stand aside. I want to win this.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.153
Then it's settled.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.533
I can't let you take all the glory.

40:13.619 --> 40:14.578
I…

40:18.833 --> 40:19.708
Tatta.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.336
You protect the base.

40:25.381 --> 40:26.382
Okay.

40:41.147 --> 40:44.608
If we guard this piece of metal,
then we're gonna win.

40:50.489 --> 40:51.490
Huh?

40:53.701 --> 40:55.369
Bet you can't catch me again!

40:59.039 --> 41:01.542
She's got 50 points left, max.

41:02.376 --> 41:04.503
One more hit and you're a goner!

41:08.591 --> 41:10.050
Goken, wait!

41:10.134 --> 41:12.011
Don't let her provoke you like that.

41:13.095 --> 41:15.723
Come on, victory's ours either way!

41:22.563 --> 41:23.647
Aah!

41:30.654 --> 41:31.655
Yes, I'm alive!

41:34.867 --> 41:36.785
Let's party!

41:52.760 --> 41:54.094
There's another one.

42:25.209 --> 42:26.585
You bored yet?

42:27.545 --> 42:31.423
You must be craving some fun.
You're looking for a rush, aren't you?

42:34.510 --> 42:36.011
You know us so well!

42:36.095 --> 42:37.930
Isn't that right, Arisu?

42:47.273 --> 42:48.190
KYUMA
INFINITE

42:48.691 --> 42:49.525
MAKI
INFINITE

42:50.109 --> 42:51.360
UTA
INFINITE

42:52.486 --> 42:53.779
It'll never work.

43:20.806 --> 43:21.724
Huh?

43:54.465 --> 43:56.091
Whooo!

44:08.729 --> 44:09.855
All set?

44:11.398 --> 44:12.358
Uh-huh.

44:41.011 --> 44:42.054
Yaah!

45:08.706 --> 45:10.124
ARISU
INACTIVE

45:13.711 --> 45:15.129
You were out of commission!

45:29.518 --> 45:32.521
<i>The scores have been updated.</i>

45:33.939 --> 45:35.691
<i>-The King of Clubs team…</i>
-Yes!

45:35.774 --> 45:36.608
Yes! Come on!!

45:36.692 --> 45:38.026
NIRAGI
INACTIVE

45:38.110 --> 45:39.319
Niragi!

45:45.325 --> 45:46.368
Kuina!

45:48.120 --> 45:49.037
Go!

46:00.716 --> 46:03.719
<i>The scores have been updated.</i>

46:05.888 --> 46:09.892
<i>The King of Clubs team is now leading</i>
<i>by 3,000 points.</i>

46:20.319 --> 46:23.030
Congrats on 10,000!
Too bad it's not enough!

46:24.239 --> 46:25.866
Well done, Arisu.

46:25.949 --> 46:27.743
Your team had a good go.

46:28.410 --> 46:30.078
But your plan has failed you.

46:31.121 --> 46:33.457
You could get
the remaining items, of course,

46:33.957 --> 46:35.542
but it won't be enough.

46:37.836 --> 46:40.631
And we're not giving you
a chance to win now.

46:41.173 --> 46:44.593
We're guarding the base with
everything we've got till time runs out.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.638
Better accept it.

46:47.721 --> 46:49.973
<i>Twenty minutes remain.</i>

46:50.891 --> 46:55.229
<i>The King of Clubs team</i>
<i>is currently leading by 3,000 points.</i>

47:13.205 --> 47:15.290
I'm sorry.

47:17.793 --> 47:19.127
This is my fault.

47:22.798 --> 47:23.924
No.

47:25.425 --> 47:27.010
We gave it all we had.

47:29.555 --> 47:31.807
My plan just wasn't good enough.

47:32.558 --> 47:33.559
I'm sorry.

47:35.143 --> 47:37.688
So… So, what? That's it?

47:42.025 --> 47:44.945
Because of you,
we're all gonna fuckin' die, asshole.

47:56.999 --> 47:58.458
I'll look for items.

47:59.376 --> 48:00.752
There's no point.

48:01.879 --> 48:03.755
Maybe not, but I have to do it.

48:05.841 --> 48:06.758
For me.

48:10.679 --> 48:11.889
I have to fight.

48:13.473 --> 48:14.933
See it through to the end.

48:26.528 --> 48:27.863
She's strong.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.700
I sure couldn't do that.

49:07.194 --> 49:09.821
"You're my teammates. You're my friends."

49:14.368 --> 49:16.203
What a crock of bullshit.

49:18.872 --> 49:20.040
Fuck!

49:30.884 --> 49:32.594
I was so stupid.

49:44.356 --> 49:45.941
Well, either way,

49:46.775 --> 49:48.443
I don't have much time left.

50:43.206 --> 50:45.000
Isn't there anything we can do?

50:59.848 --> 51:00.849
I got it!

51:11.777 --> 51:14.863
<i>The player team has secured an item.</i>

51:17.365 --> 51:21.328
<i>The King of Clubs team is now leading</i>
<i>by 500 points.</i>

51:22.329 --> 51:23.955
Usagi found the final item!

51:26.708 --> 51:28.251
Just 500 to go.

51:29.044 --> 51:30.295
Think! Come on!

51:31.171 --> 51:32.672
We gotta do something!

51:35.842 --> 51:37.803
Kyuma's base… I have to go.

51:37.886 --> 51:39.137
Why?

51:39.221 --> 51:41.807
Five hundred.
That's nothing! We can do this!

51:43.266 --> 51:44.184
It's all over.

51:44.267 --> 51:47.604
If I'm going to die,
I'll do everything I can.

51:48.396 --> 51:49.439
Arisu.

51:52.484 --> 51:53.401
Huh.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.195
I have to say,

51:55.779 --> 51:57.739
before I go to at least try…

52:00.659 --> 52:01.660
Tatta.

52:03.411 --> 52:05.163
I love your positive attitude.

52:06.039 --> 52:07.999
You've always cheered me up, Tatta.

52:12.504 --> 52:13.713
Thank you, friend.

52:26.726 --> 52:28.395
<i>Ten minutes remain.</i>

52:28.478 --> 52:32.274
<i>The King of Clubs team</i>
<i>is currently leading by 500 points.</i>

52:32.357 --> 52:33.775
There's still a chance.

52:42.242 --> 52:43.243
Niragi?

52:54.379 --> 52:56.089
Yeah, poor Niragi.

52:57.299 --> 53:01.553
-I found the last item. We just need 500--
-It's a waste of time.

53:02.804 --> 53:04.306
Well, I'm not giving up.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.731
We're all gonna die.

53:13.523 --> 53:15.025
Me, you.

53:17.652 --> 53:20.197
Everyone's gonna die.

53:25.619 --> 53:27.370
You're better than all of us.

53:27.913 --> 53:30.874
That's what you think, isn't it,
that you're better than us, huh?

53:35.670 --> 53:37.631
Am I really so unclean?

53:38.506 --> 53:39.466
Huh?

53:41.343 --> 53:43.553
Everyone looks at me like that now.

53:53.230 --> 53:55.899
<i>I don't know if they hated me</i>
<i>because I was twisted,</i>

53:56.608 --> 53:59.277
<i>or if I became twisted</i>
<i>because they hated me.</i>

54:06.201 --> 54:07.744
I guess Kyuma was right.

54:09.996 --> 54:12.916
Only by facing death
can you learn who you are.

54:15.001 --> 54:16.878
I get it now.

54:17.796 --> 54:19.130
I know who I am.

54:20.966 --> 54:23.927
I'm not the kind of person
with friends to rely on.

54:25.553 --> 54:28.431
I'm not the kind of person
with hopes and dreams.

54:30.850 --> 54:31.893
I'm garbage.

54:56.710 --> 54:59.212
Me and you can finally finish
what we started!

55:01.589 --> 55:04.301
We can have one last screw,
right here, you and me,

55:04.384 --> 55:06.469
before we go out with a bang!

55:14.144 --> 55:16.146
Usagi!

55:20.275 --> 55:21.109
Arisu!

55:21.693 --> 55:23.111
Shut the fuck up!

55:36.958 --> 55:39.502
<i>Nine minutes remain.</i>

55:40.170 --> 55:43.631

56:00.148 --> 56:02.525
Whooo!
