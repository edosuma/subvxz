00:47.281 --> 00:49.381
- KIND OF HARD TO MISS.
- SO GROSS.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.087
- I THINK IT'S COOL.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.560
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
ACTUALLY DOING THIS...FOR HIM.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.758
- IT'S NOT FOR HIM.
- I MEAN,

00:55.789 --> 00:57.429
JUST BECAUSE HE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO--

00:57.458 --> 01:01.298
- HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND.
I DON'T DO BOYFRIENDS.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.129
BESIDES, HALF THE KIDS
IN SCHOOL

01:03.164 --> 01:04.504
HAVE THEIR NOSES
OR THEIR EARS PIERCED.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.572
ERICA JACOBSON EVEN HAS
HER BELLY BUTTON PIERCED.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.300
- ERICA JACOBSON IS A WHORE.
A-AND IT'S DANGEROUS.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.438
THIS GIRL IN TEXAS,
HER BOYFRIEND WENT TO KISS HER,

01:12.473 --> 01:14.313
HIS BRACES GOT CAUGHT
IN HER TONGUE RING,

01:14.342 --> 01:15.482
RIPPED IT CLEAR
OUT OF HER MOUTH.

01:15.509 --> 01:16.679
- THINGS LIKE THAT
ALWAYS HAPPEN IN TEXAS.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.180
- WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY WITH
THE STUD IN HIS NOSTRIL, HMM?

01:19.213 --> 01:21.183
GANGRENE SET IN. HE HAD TO HAVE
HIS ENTIRE NOSE AMPUTATED.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.315
- URBAN LEGEND.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.850
- WHO'S NEXT?

01:24.885 --> 01:28.785
TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT, HONEY.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.722
SO WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT,
RIGHT OR LEFT?

01:30.758 --> 01:32.458
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:32.493 --> 01:36.733

02:18.472 --> 02:20.512
- NOTICE THAT PRACTICALLY EVERY
GUY IN HERE'S BEEN CRUISING US?

02:20.541 --> 02:22.841
- I SHOULD'VE WARNED YOU.
THE...CLIENTELE

02:22.876 --> 02:25.446
DOESN'T EXACTLY COME HERE
FOR THE FIVE-STAR CUISINE.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.519
EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS WISHING
THEY HAD A BOYFRIEND.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.818
WE ALL PICTURE HOW HE'D LOOK,
HOW HE'D SOUND,

02:29.850 --> 02:31.950
HOW NICE IT'D BE TO HAVE
SOMEONE TO SHARE YOUR LIFE,

02:31.985 --> 02:33.815
YOUR DREAMS,
YOUR DENTAL FLOSS.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.794
- A LITTLE DISCONCERTING
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO EAT.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.293
- SO HOW COME
SO FEW OF US HAVE ONE?

02:37.325 --> 02:38.525
THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE LYING.

02:38.559 --> 02:39.959
MOST OF US COULDN'T COMMIT
TO A HOUSEPLANT.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.263
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO COMMIT
TO HAVING A BOYFRIEND?

02:42.296 --> 02:45.196
YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE
WHEN BRIAN COMES HERE.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.535
I'M SO SORRY, I PROMISED
I WOULD NOT MENTION HIS NAME

02:49.570 --> 02:53.240
FOR TEN MINUTES.
- I'D SETTLE FOR FIVE.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.644
AND YOU'VE GOT TO STOP SMILING
LIKE THAT.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.306
- LIKE WHAT?
- LIKE THAT.

02:57.345 --> 02:58.675
IT MAKES ME WANT
TO COME ACROSS THE TABLE

02:58.712 --> 03:00.752
AND EAT YOU
LIKE A DESSERT.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.821
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME
WHIPPED CREAM WITH THAT, SIR?

03:03.851 --> 03:05.491
- I'D STAY AWAY
FROM THAT ONION, HONEY,

03:05.519 --> 03:06.689
ESPECIALLY IF YOU TWO
ARE PLANNING ON GOING

03:06.720 --> 03:07.690
AT IT ALL NIGHT.

03:07.721 --> 03:08.961
- MA, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

03:08.989 --> 03:09.959
- TRYING TO PAY MY BILLS.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.930
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

03:12.960 --> 03:16.330
- THIS IS--THIS IS YOUR, UH...
- MOTHER.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.904
- I'M DEBBIE, AND YOU'RE...

03:17.931 --> 03:20.731
GODDAMN GORGEOUS
IS WHAT YOU ARE.

03:20.768 --> 03:21.638
- MA, THIS IS DAVID.
AND I--

03:21.669 --> 03:23.969
I THOUGHT TONIGHT
WAS YOUR NIGHT OFF.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.474
- OH, YEAH, LORRAINE GOT
FOOD POISONING.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.976
I THINK IT WAS THE SHISH KABOB.
[laughs]

03:28.008 --> 03:30.238
I'M JUST KIDDING.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.778
OKAY, GOT TO GET CRANKING.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.783
GOT A LOT OF HUNGRY BOYS
TO FEED.

03:34.815 --> 03:38.415
JESUS, MY BACK
IS KILLING ME.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.992
- HEY.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.620
IF YOU LIFT FROM YOUR KNEES,

03:42.656 --> 03:44.326
TAKES THE PRESSURE OFF
YOUR BACK.

03:44.358 --> 03:47.658
YOU FEEL THAT?
- YEAH, I'LL REMEMBER THAT.

03:47.695 --> 03:51.625
YOU'RE AN ANGEL.
- NO, I'M A CHIROPRACTOR.

03:51.665 --> 03:52.665
- YOU'RE A DOCTOR?

03:52.700 --> 03:55.900
- YEAH.
- YOU'RE DATING A DOCTOR?

03:55.936 --> 03:58.466
HOW LONG WERE YOU PLANNING
ON HIDING HIM FROM ME?

03:58.506 --> 03:59.866
- AS LONG AS I COULD.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.337
- YOU'RE COMING FOR DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.336
- HE CAN'T.
- I CAN'T?

04:03.377 --> 04:05.647
- YOU GOT PLANS.
HE'S GOT PLANS. HE'S VERY BUSY.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.349
- DEBBIE, I'D LOVE TO.
- GOOD FOR YOU.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.551
I'LL SEE YOU THERE, 7:30.
- OKAY.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.893
[chuckles]

04:11.919 --> 04:15.689
- CRAIG?

04:15.723 --> 04:18.762
AREN'T YOU GOING TO SAY
ANYTHING?

04:21.362 --> 04:22.762
- JUSTIN'S NOT GAY.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.526
THOSE NUDE DRAWINGS YOU FOUND,

04:25.566 --> 04:27.636
THEY'RE PROBABLY JUST
AN ASSIGNMENT FOR ART CLASS.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.798
AND THE UNDERWEAR, I'M SURE
HE JUST BOUGHT IT FOR HIMSELF.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.537
- IT'S NOT HIS SIZE.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.782
- STILL, THAT'S NO REASON
TO SUSPECT THAT HE'S...

04:34.808 --> 04:36.878
- HE TOLD ME HIMSELF.
- SO WHAT?

04:36.910 --> 04:40.780
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
A LOT OF KIDS THINK THAT.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.854
THEY'RE CONFUSED,
THEY'RE SCARED.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.853
- HE'S NOT CONFUSED.
HE'S NOT SCARED.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.415
HE KNOWS.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.655
THE SAME WAY
WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.019
- NO, NO, I HAVE NOT
ALWAYS KNOWN.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.058
- AT LEAST SUSPECTED.
- NO, YOU'VE SUSPECTED.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.934
HE'S NOT GAY.
HE'S...

04:55.963 --> 04:57.803
- WHAT, SENSITIVE?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.731
DIFFERENT?
ARTISTIC?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.067
- HE'S HIS OWN PERSON.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.801
YOU KNOW, NOT EVERY KID
IS THE QUARTERBACK

05:02.836 --> 05:03.936
ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.711
- I THINK YOU BETTER TALK
TO HIM.

05:05.739 --> 05:08.509
- [chuckles]
AND SAY WHAT?

05:08.542 --> 05:10.442
"YOUR MOTHER THINKS
YOU'RE A HOMOSEXUAL"?

05:10.478 --> 05:12.048
- BEFORE HE GETS HIMSELF
INTO TROUBLE.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.979
BEFORE HE EXPOSES HIMSELF
TO GOD KNOWS WHAT.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.515
IF HE HASN'T ALREADY.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.790
- WAIT.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.420
YOU'RE SAYING
HE'S DOING THINGS?

05:21.455 --> 05:24.855
- HE'S...17.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.562
HOW NAIVE CAN YOU BE?

05:26.594 --> 05:27.804
- SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

05:27.828 --> 05:30.458
- I PROMISED HIM
I WOULDN'T.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.498
- OH, THAT'S TERRIFIC.

05:33.534 --> 05:36.944
DON'T I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE?

05:36.970 --> 05:40.110
HEY, JUSTIN!
- HE'S NOT HERE.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.880
HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DAPHNE'S,
BUT I KNOW HE'S NOT.

05:42.910 --> 05:46.050
- SO WHERE IS HE?

05:46.079 --> 05:49.419
- THE OTHER NIGHT, I FOUND HIM
IN A GAY BAR.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.850
- I DON'T FUCKING BELIEVE THIS,
JEN.

05:50.884 --> 05:54.664
YOU LET HIM GO TO THESE PLACES?
- I HAD NO IDEA.

05:54.688 --> 05:58.558
- WELL, I'M PUTTING A STOP
TO THIS RIGHT NOW.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.932
- THERE'S MORE.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.001
HE'S SEEING SOMEONE.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.741
- SO WHO IS THIS KID?
I'LL CALL HIS PARENTS.

06:07.768 --> 06:11.068
- HE'S NOT A KID.
HE'S A MAN.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.614
HIS NAME IS BRIAN KINNEY.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.445
- I SAY, IF IT WALKS
LIKE A BOYFRIEND...

06:19.480 --> 06:20.610
- TALKS LIKE
A BOYFRIEND...

06:20.648 --> 06:23.048
both: THEN IT MUST BE
A BOYFRIEND.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.893
- WOULD YOU TWO PLEASE
SHUT THE FUCK UP?

06:24.918 --> 06:26.888
- I THINK IT'S GREAT
THAT MIKEY'S GOT A STEADY.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.860
- HE'S NOT A STEADY.
WE WENT OUT TWICE.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.160
- AROUND HERE, THAT'S
A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.992
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
YOU'LL BE EXCHANGING RINGS.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.657
- MM, AND THEN THERE'LL BE ONE
OF THOSE COMMITMENT CEREMONIES

06:36.697 --> 06:38.197
WHERE, LIKE,
ALL 200 OF THE GUESTS

06:38.231 --> 06:41.101
HAVE SLEPT WITH ONE, IF NOT
BOTH, OF THE HAPPY COUPLE.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.644
- JUST, UM, PROMISE ME

06:42.670 --> 06:44.040
YOU WON'T WEAR
MATCHING WHITE SUITS.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.841
- THERE'S NO WAY THAT IS
EVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

06:46.874 --> 06:50.644
- WELL, THEN I SUGGEST YOU
WATCH OUT FOR THE WARNING SIGNS.

06:50.678 --> 06:51.808
- WHAT WARNING SIGNS?

06:51.845 --> 06:53.575
- LIKE WHEN
HE BRINGS YOU FLOWERS.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.654
- OR INVITES YOU AWAY FOR A
ROMANTIC WEEKEND IN THE COUNTRY.

06:56.684 --> 07:00.524
- NOT THAT YOU'LL SEE MUCH
BESIDE THE BEDROOM CEILING.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.064
- YOUR SHOT, MIKEY.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.159
- OH, OR THE MOST TELLTALE SIGN
OF ALL,

07:05.192 --> 07:06.862
WHEN HE MEETS
YOUR MOTHER,

07:06.894 --> 07:10.104
AND SHE INVITES HIM OVER
FOR DINNER.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.729
- SOMETHING THE MATTER?

07:13.767 --> 07:14.967
- I LOST MY GRIP.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.902
- GUESS WHAT I GOT TODAY.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.067
- A NEW BELL
FOR YOUR BICYCLE?

07:19.106 --> 07:22.106
- A NIPPLE RING.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.912
- EVERY PIECE OF TRASH
HAS SOMETHING

07:23.944 --> 07:25.554
STUCK THROUGH THEIR EAR
OR THEIR NOSE

07:25.579 --> 07:28.119
OR THEIR BELLY BUTTON
OR THEIR COCK.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.578
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M EVEN REMOTELY INTERESTED

07:30.618 --> 07:32.588
THAT YOU HAVE A RING
THROUGH YOUR TIT?

07:32.620 --> 07:35.560
- IT'S LATE.
I GOT WORK.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.189
- DON'T FORGET
ABOUT THIS FRIDAY.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.964
- WHAT'S THIS FRIDAY?
- YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.563
- TELL ME.

07:41.595 --> 07:44.665
- JUST SOME HEATHEN RITUAL
CALLED "STUDS IN SUDS."

07:44.698 --> 07:47.668

WHAT'S THAT?

07:47.701 --> 07:49.571
- WELL...

FIRST THEY FLOOD THE DANCE FLOOR
AT BABYLON WITH SOAPSUDS.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.512
- AND THEN EVERYONE STRIPS
DOWN TO THEIR UNDIES...

07:53.541 --> 07:56.811
- OR LESS, AND DANCES...
CHEEK TO CHEEK.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.114

08:06.720 --> 08:09.020
- GUESS WHO'S
HEAD OVER HEELS?

08:09.056 --> 08:10.716

"HEELS OVER HEAD."

08:10.758 --> 08:12.058
[laughter]

08:12.092 --> 08:13.532
- DOES MICHAEL HAVE
A BOYFRIEND?

08:13.561 --> 08:14.801
- THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.728
- I JUST WANT TO KNOW.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.804
- WELL, DON'T STICK YOUR TIT IN
WHERE IT DOESN'T BELONG.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.803

* TRAPPED INSIDE
A UNIVERSE *

09:57.765 --> 10:00.695
* ALL ALONE

10:00.734 --> 10:04.344
* ALONE IN THIS PARTY
OF ONE *

10:04.371 --> 10:07.911
* ALL ALONE

10:07.941 --> 10:11.211
* ALONE IN THIS PARTY
OF ONE *

10:11.244 --> 10:14.684
* TRULY AM
MY FATHER'S SON *

10:14.715 --> 10:18.045
* TRULY AM MY FATHER'S SON

10:18.085 --> 10:24.015
* TRULY AM
MY FATHER'S SON *

10:25.392 --> 10:27.392
[knock on door]
- OOH.

10:27.427 --> 10:31.157
THAT MUST BE
PRINCE CHARMING.

10:31.198 --> 10:34.738
MAKE THAT
THE WICKED WITCH.

10:34.768 --> 10:35.998
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

10:36.036 --> 10:37.706
- I'M HUNGRY.
LET'S GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.038
- I'M GOING TO MY MOM'S,
REMEMBER?

10:39.072 --> 10:42.082
- OH, RIGHT, DIN-DIN WITH DOC.
I FORGOT.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.309
- HE'S GOING TO BE HERE
ANY MINUTE, SO YOU BETTER GO.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.753
- WHAT'S THIS?

10:44.778 --> 10:46.278
- CHOCOLATE ECLAIRS
FROM THE BIG Q BAKERY.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.853
I BOUGHT THEM FOR DESSE...

10:47.881 --> 10:48.881
- WOW. IT'S TAKES YEARS
OF PRACTICE

10:48.916 --> 10:51.886
TO DEVELOP TECHNIQUE
LIKE THAT.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.289
- LOOK, I KNOW
YOU DON'T LIKE HIM...

10:53.320 --> 10:55.020
- WHO SAID
I DON'T LIKE HIM?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.815
AND WHY DO YOU GIVE A FUCK
WHAT I THINK?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.227
- I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT
FOR YEARS.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.158
- WHAT MATTERS IS
WHAT YOU THINK.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.763
IF YOU LIKE HIM,
THAT'S ALL THAT'S IMPORTANT.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.097
EVEN THOUGH HE IS QUITE A BIT
OLDER THAN YOU...

11:06.133 --> 11:07.943
AND LIVES IN A WORLD
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.368
- SHUT UP.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.402
- ARE YOU SAYING
HE'S TOO GOOD FOR ME?

11:11.438 --> 11:12.808
- NOBODY'S TOO GOOD
FOR YOU, MIKEY.

11:12.840 --> 11:13.970
YOU'RE BETTER THAN ANYONE.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.737
- BECAUSE HE HAPPENS
TO THINK I'M HOT.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.306
YOU KNOW,
SOME PEOPLE DO.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.454
- HAVEN'T I ALWAYS
TOLD YOU THAT?

11:19.479 --> 11:22.019
[knock on door]
- I'LL GET IT.

11:24.484 --> 11:28.194
- DAVE, BUDDY.
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.191
- REALLY? HI, EMMETT.
- HI.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.863
- HI.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.464
THESE ARE GREAT.
MY MOM'LL LOVE THESE.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.495
- HERS ARE IN THE CAR.
THOSE ARE FOR YOU.

11:38.531 --> 11:42.901
- THE SECOND SIGN--
FLOWERS.

11:42.936 --> 11:47.336
I'LL JUST PUT THESE
IN SOME WATER.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.084
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

11:49.109 --> 11:54.509
- HE'S ALLERGIC TO BOYFRIENDS
BRINGING BOUQUETS.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.347
- WELL, WE BETTER GO.
[clears throat]

11:56.383 --> 11:59.153
DON'T WANT TO BE LATE.

12:02.122 --> 12:05.362
- DON'T FORGET THIS.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.032
HAVE FUN, YOU TWO.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.201
- YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T TELL.
YOU PROMISED.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.836
- JUSTIN, I HAD NO CHOICE.
I HAD TO TELL DADDY.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.271
- YOU LIED TO ME.
YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.877
- IT WAS
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.039
WHEN I SAW YOU
WITH THIS BRIAN...

12:24.077 --> 12:26.377
- YOU KEEP CALLING HIM
"THIS BRIAN,"

12:26.413 --> 12:28.923
LIKE THAT'S HIS NAME.
IT'S JUST BRIAN.

12:28.949 --> 12:34.519
- WHEN I SAW YOU
WITH BRIAN...

12:34.554 --> 12:36.424
HIS ARMS AROUND YOU,
KISSING YOU--

12:36.456 --> 12:38.226
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.258
NOT FOR THE REASON
YOU THINK.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.234
IT'S NOT RIGHT
FOR A MAN HIS AGE

12:44.264 --> 12:46.874
TO BE TOUCHING YOU.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.470
TO BE HAVING SEX
WITH YOU.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.542
AND...

12:52.572 --> 12:57.482
EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY THINK
YOU LOVE HIM...

12:57.510 --> 12:59.910
I'M SURE
HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.147
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- HE'S AN ADULT.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.952
IT'S ILLEGAL FOR AN ADULT
TO HAVE SEX WITH A MINOR.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.915
- HONEY, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
WE DON'T BLAME YOU.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.894
WE UNDERSTAND
THIS MAN ENTICED YOU.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.522
- HE DIDN'T ENTICE ME.
I WANTED HIM.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.028
- JUSTIN...GOD!

13:14.061 --> 13:16.501
Y-YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.099
- CRAIG, PLEASE.
YOU PROMISED YOU'D STAY CALM.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.072
- I--I AM CALM.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.602
WHAT ABOUT AIDS?

13:23.636 --> 13:26.436
- HE WORE A CONDOM.
I PUT IT ON HIM MYSELF.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.413
- OH, GOD!
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.412
- YOU'RE NOT
CALLING ANYBODY.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.953
THAT'S ALL WE NEED IS
FOR EVERYBODY TO KNOW.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.109
- WHAT,
YOU WANT THIS MONSTER,

13:34.147 --> 13:36.217
THIS CHILD MOLESTER
TO GO FREE?

13:36.249 --> 13:41.189
- HE DIDN'T MOLEST ME,
AND I'M NOT A CHILD.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.621
I LOVE HIM...

13:43.656 --> 13:46.356
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
IN MY LIFE.

13:46.393 --> 13:49.503
IT'S ALL I WANT,

13:49.529 --> 13:51.969
IS TO BE WITH HIM.

13:51.999 --> 13:55.939
- I DON'T EVER WANT TO HEAR YOU
SAY THAT AGAIN.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.939
AND YOU ARE NOT
TO SEE HIM.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.411
- I'M GOING TO SEE HIM.
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.480
- I DON'T THINK SO.
NO, YOU'RE NOT, JUSTIN.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.950
HEY, JUSTIN!

14:05.979 --> 14:09.419
- HAVE SOME MORE CARBONARA,
DAVID.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.889
- I'M STUFFED, THANKS.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.419
- OH, COME ON. WITH THAT BODY,
YOU CAN AFFORD TO CARBO-LOAD.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.464
- YEAH, YOU MUST WORK OUT
ALL THE TIME.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.289
- WELL, WHEN I CAN.
- FEEL THOSE BICEPS.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.556
I NEVER COULD RESIST
A HARD BODY.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.234
LIKE MOTHER, LIKE SON.
- LIKE UNCLE.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.965
- LIKE, WILL YOU TWO
PLEASE LEAVE HIM ALONE?

14:28.001 --> 14:29.671
NEXT YOU'LL BE ASKING
WHAT KIND OF CAR HE DRIVES

14:29.702 --> 14:34.642
AND HOW MUCH HE MAKES.
- [laughs]

14:34.674 --> 14:38.054
I DRIVE A JAG,
AND I'M COMFORTABLE.

14:39.712 --> 14:43.152
- MICHAEL, IF YOU DON'T MARRY
THIS MAN IMMEDIATELY, I WILL.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.693
- I THINK I WILL HAVE
A LITTLE MORE.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.688
- ME TOO.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.121
- [laughs]
IT'S LIKE LADY AND THE TRAMP.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.687
- LADY AND THE TRAMP?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.264
- IT'S MICHAEL'S
FAVORITE MOVIE.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.163
- WHEN I WAS NINE.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.225
- SEE, LADY AND TRAMP
GO ON THIS DATE

14:56.263 --> 14:59.233
TO AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT,
AND THEN THE WAITER...

14:59.266 --> 15:02.266
- TONY.
- WHAT ELSE WOULD HIS NAME BE?

15:02.302 --> 15:05.012
BRINGS OVER THIS BIG BOWL
OF SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS.

15:05.038 --> 15:09.238
AND, UM--AND THEY PUT
THEIR HEAD IN THE BOWL...

15:09.276 --> 15:12.246
THEY'RE DOGS.
[laughter]

15:12.279 --> 15:16.549
AND THEY COME UP WITH THIS
ONE SINGLE STRAND OF SPAGHETTI.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.023
AND THEN THEY CHEW,
AND THEY CHEW AND...

15:19.052 --> 15:21.592
- THEY GET CLOSER
AND CLOSER...

15:21.621 --> 15:23.961
- UNTIL FINALLY,
THEIR LIPS MEET.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.161
[chuckles]

15:26.193 --> 15:29.503
- IT IS, IN MY ESTIMATION,
THE GREATEST SCREEN KISS EVER.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.129
- I--I REMEMBER IT.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.704
LIKE THIS.

15:38.405 --> 15:41.365
[romantic Italian music]

15:41.408 --> 15:49.348
*

15:56.523 --> 15:59.263
- THAT'S EVEN BETTER
THAN THE MOVIE.

15:59.292 --> 16:07.302
*

16:17.144 --> 16:18.254
- YOU WANT TO SEE
MY OLD ROOM?

16:18.278 --> 16:20.308
- I'D LOVE TO SEE
YOUR OLD ROOM.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.519
- AND BE GENTLE.
[laughter]

16:33.593 --> 16:35.463
- I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL WEEK
TO DO THIS.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.325
- ME TOO.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.125
- JUST HASN'T BEEN ANY TIME.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.367
- I KNOW.
IT'S HARD.

16:42.402 --> 16:45.472
FINDING THE TIME.
[laughter]

16:45.505 --> 16:47.235
- I GOT A SOLUTION.
- MM-HMM.

16:47.274 --> 16:48.314
- I GOT A SOLUTION.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.411
HOW'D YOU LIKE TO GO AWAY
WITH ME FOR THE WEEKEND?

16:51.444 --> 16:52.784
- HUH?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.552
- I GOT A CABIN
UP IN THE WOODS.

16:54.581 --> 16:58.251
- WILL I GET TO SEE ANYTHING
BESIDES THE BEDROOM CEILING?

16:58.285 --> 17:01.785
- WORD OF HONOR.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

17:06.425 --> 17:09.556
- SAY "YES," YOU LITTLE ASSHOLE,
OR I'LL DISOWN YOU.

17:09.596 --> 17:12.396
[laughter]

17:12.432 --> 17:15.402
- LIKE I SAID,
IT'S A VERY SMALL HOUSE.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.405

[typing]

17:25.545 --> 17:29.475

17:29.516 --> 17:31.416
- 6 FULLER,
CORNER OF TREMONT.

17:31.451 --> 17:36.221
IT SHOULD TAKE YOU TEN MINUTES--
ONE FOR EVERY INCH.

17:39.592 --> 17:44.062
[knock on door]

17:50.403 --> 17:52.873
YOU GOT LAID.
- I DID NOT.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.605
- YES, YOU DID.
I CAN ALWAYS TELL.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.853
I THOUGHT YOU AND DAVE
WERE HAVING DINNER AT DEB'S.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.448
- DINNER'S OVER.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.250
- [scoffs]
WHAT, DID SHE SCARE HIM OFF?

18:02.282 --> 18:05.252
- ACTUALLY, SHE AND VIC
WERE ON THEIR BEST BEHAVIOR.

18:05.285 --> 18:09.415
- THAT'S EVEN SCARIER.
LISTEN, YOU CAN'T STAY.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.216
I'VE GOT SOMEONE COMING OVER
IN APPROXIMATELY

18:11.258 --> 18:13.788
7 1/2 INCHES, SO...

18:13.826 --> 18:19.166
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
AT STUDS IN SUDS.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.299
- I CAN'T GO.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.874
THAT'S WHAT I CAME OVER HERE
TO TELL YOU.

18:24.904 --> 18:25.874
[sighs]

18:25.905 --> 18:29.475
DAVID INVITED ME AWAY WITH HIM
FOR THE WEEKEND.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.211
HE HAS A CABIN.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.576
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW,
JUST LIKE THE BOY SAID--

18:35.615 --> 18:38.515
FLOWERS,
DINNER AT MOM'S,

18:38.551 --> 18:40.751
AND NOW AN INVITATION
TO THE COUNTRY.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.387
- YOU'RE MAD.
- WHY WOULD I BE MAD?

18:43.423 --> 18:45.233
I MEAN, WHO WANTS TO BE
ON A CROWDED DANCE FLOOR

18:45.258 --> 18:47.358
SURROUNDED BY NAKED MEN
COVERED IN SOAPSUDS

18:47.394 --> 18:49.834
WHEN YOU CAN BE BREATHING
ALL THAT FRESH, COUNTRY AIR?

18:49.862 --> 18:53.502
[telephone rings]

18:53.533 --> 18:55.373
JUST DON'T FORGET TO TAKE
YOUR INHALER,

18:55.402 --> 18:57.572
IN CASE
YOUR ASTHMA ATTACKS.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.214
[telephone ringing]

18:59.239 --> 19:02.209
MUST HAVE GOTTEN LOST.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.242
I TOLD YOU, 6 FULLER,
CORNER OF TREMONT.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.907
NOW GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.645
I'VE GOT THIS NEW DILDO--

19:07.680 --> 19:11.250
9 INCHES LONG,
7 INCHES ROUND.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.924
I'M GOING TO OPEN UP
YOUR HOLE WITH IT,

19:12.952 --> 19:14.552
AND THEN I'M GOING
TO FUCK YOU SO HARD,

19:14.587 --> 19:18.557
YOUR EYES ROLL BACK
IN YOUR HEAD.

19:18.591 --> 19:22.531
- YOU EVER CONSIDERED A CAREER
IN PHONE SALES?

19:22.562 --> 19:24.932
- GET OUT OF HERE.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.841
[telephone rings]

19:29.869 --> 19:32.439
NOW WHAT?

19:35.475 --> 19:39.375
DIDN'T YOU JUST CALL?

19:39.412 --> 19:41.352
THAT WASN'T YOU?

19:48.255 --> 19:50.555
- IT'S MY NECK AGAIN.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.960
I CAN BARELY MOVE IT.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.961
- DO YOU WANT THE PERIWINKLE
OR THE APRICOT?

19:53.993 --> 19:54.793
- SHH.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.327
- [whispering]
I THINK THE APRICOT

19:56.363 --> 19:59.533
GOES BETTER WITH YOUR EYES.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.966
- UH, YEAH, I--I THINK IT'LL BE
BETTER IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

20:03.002 --> 20:06.942
OH, DON'T WORRY, I DEFINITELY
PLAN ON SEEING MY CHIROPRACTOR.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.013

- THANKS.

20:09.041 --> 20:13.281
THANKS.
BYE.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.653
- YOU KNOW WHAT GROWS
WHEN YOU LIE.

20:15.682 --> 20:16.982
- TOO BAD
IT'S YOUR NOSE.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.346
- I'M ENTITLED TO A COUPLE
OF PERSONAL DAYS.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.286
- MICHAEL, YOU'RE ENTITLED
TO A PERSONAL LIFE.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.291

ONE CHANGE OF UNDIES.
A PACK OF CONDOMS.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.835
TUBE OF LUBE.
THERE, YOU'RE ALL SET.

20:40.873 --> 20:42.483
- [chuckles]

20:46.713 --> 20:48.683
- REMEMBER WHEN MY MOM TOOK ME
TO ATLANTIC CITY,

20:48.715 --> 20:51.345
AND I GOT SICK
ON ALL THAT SALTWATER TAFFY?

20:51.384 --> 20:54.054
- LISTEN TO HIM.
HE'S GOT COLD FEET ALREADY.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.886
- I'M NOT GETTING
COLD FEET.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.962
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO
FOR A WHOLE WEEKEND.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.531
- WELL, LET'S SEE.
FIRST YOU ARRIVE...

21:00.560 --> 21:01.760

- THEN YOU GO BERRY PICKING.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.899
- THEN YOU FUCK.

21:03.930 --> 21:04.830
- I MEAN,
AFTER YOU FUCK.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.004
- YOU TALK.
YOU GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.373
- WHAT IF I RUN
OUT OF THINGS TO SAY?

21:09.402 --> 21:11.802
WHAT IF I SAY
SOME STUPID REMARK, AND HE SAYS,

21:11.838 --> 21:14.738
"WHY AM I UP HERE
WITH THIS JERK?"

21:14.774 --> 21:17.044
OR WHAT IF--
- HEY, HEY.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.576
WOULD YOU PLEASE
STOP WORRYING?

21:21.881 --> 21:24.651
- I JUST WANT HIM
TO LIKE ME.

21:24.684 --> 21:28.054
- HE ALREADY DOES.

21:30.590 --> 21:33.830
HE MORE THAN LIKES YOU.

21:38.431 --> 21:41.801
- SO YOU GO,
AND YOU HAVE A FABULOUS TIME.

21:41.834 --> 21:46.474
AND BRING US BACK
SOME BERRIES.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.910
- THAT'S--
NOT MY BERRIES.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.679
- HOW MUCH?
- 2,000.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.075
WHO KNEW IT WOULD BE
SO EXPENSIVE HAVING A KID?

21:58.117 --> 22:00.117
- OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.362
- CAN I TELL YOU
THAT I LOVE YOU TO DEATH?

22:03.390 --> 22:06.060
- HMM. YOU AND MELANIE REALLY
ARE AFTER MY LIFE INSURANCE.

22:06.092 --> 22:10.432
- AND THAT YOU ARE
EXCEEDINGLY GENEROUS?

22:10.463 --> 22:13.833
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I BARELY HAVE
ENOUGH LEFT FOR STUDS IN SUDS.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.666
- OH, IS THAT THIS WEEKEND?
YOU GOING WITH MICHAEL?

22:16.703 --> 22:19.013
- MICHAEL WENT TO THE COUNTRY
WITH THE PROCTOLOGIST.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.838
- CHIROPRACTOR.
- WHATEVER.

22:20.873 --> 22:21.973
- OH, SOUNDS ROMANTIC.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.508
PEACEFUL WALKS,
COZY FIRES...

22:24.544 --> 22:28.684
- STEPPING IN BEAR SHIT,
BEING STUNG BY MOSQUITOES.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.015
I GUARANTEE YOU,
AFTER TWO DAYS,

22:30.049 --> 22:32.649
HE'LL WISH HE WAS BACK HERE
WITH ME IN BABYLON.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.115
- I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.893
HE MIGHT ACTUALLY LIKE
A CHANGE OF SCENE,

22:35.922 --> 22:37.962
NOT TO MENTION SOMEONE WHO
ACTUALLY WANTS TO BE WITH HIM.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.590
- YOU KNOW,
I TOLD HIM,

22:39.626 --> 22:41.126
"I'M GLAD YOU'RE GOING OUT
WITH DAVE."

22:41.160 --> 22:42.700
HE CAN'T SPEND
THE REST OF HIS LIFE

22:42.729 --> 22:44.859
TRICKING AND GOING TO CLUBS.

22:44.897 --> 22:47.767
IT'S TIME
HE SETTLED DOWN...

22:47.800 --> 22:49.040
AND GREW UP.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.538
- [laughs]
YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.171
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
WHY TWO PEOPLE

22:53.205 --> 22:54.735
WOULD WANT TO BE TOGETHER,
CAN YOU?

22:54.774 --> 22:56.614
- THE DESIRE TO FALL ASLEEP
IN FRONT OF JAY LENO

22:56.643 --> 22:59.053
AND ARGUE OVER WHOSE TURN IT IS
TO PICK UP THE DRY CLEANING?

22:59.078 --> 23:01.608
- IT'S CALLED NOT WANTING
TO BE ALONE,

23:01.648 --> 23:03.148
KNOWING THAT YOU'RE LOVED.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.722
APPARENTLY,
A LOT OF US NEED THAT,

23:04.751 --> 23:07.151
INCLUDING MICHAEL.

23:07.186 --> 23:10.516
SO PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
FUCK IT UP FOR HIM.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.031
- YOU RAN INTO MY LANE,
YOU STUPID ASS.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.033
- I COULDN'T SEE YOU.
I FORGOT MY CONTACTS.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.995
- FAG.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.542
HEY, TAYLOR. AREN'T YOU GONNA
TAKE A SHOWER?

23:25.572 --> 23:27.442
- I HAVE TO FINISH A PAPER
FOR NESSLER.

23:27.474 --> 23:28.784
YOU KNOW
WHAT A BITCH SHE IS.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.638
- DON'T YOU WANNA CHECK OUT
ALL THE GUYS' DICKS?

23:31.678 --> 23:34.578
I KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU LIKE THAT.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.224
HEY, WHAT'S THAT?
- NOTHING.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.788
- LET'S SEE.
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

23:38.818 --> 23:41.788
- A PIERCING PARLOR
ON LIBERTY AVENUE.

23:41.821 --> 23:45.591
- SHIT, YOU REALLY ARE A QUEER.
- AM NOT.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.685
- YEAH? THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE
A NIPPLE RING?

23:47.727 --> 23:48.997
- I WANTED IT.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.758
- YEAH,
SO YOUR FUDGE-PACKING FRIENDS

23:50.797 --> 23:52.727
CAN PULL ON IT
WHILE THEY'RE BUTT-FUCKING YOU?

23:52.765 --> 23:54.965
- HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT WHAT FAGGOTS DO

23:55.001 --> 23:57.841
UNLESS YOU ARE ONE?

23:59.138 --> 24:00.668
- FIGHT!

24:00.707 --> 24:02.837
- BREAK IT UP.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.845
- COME ON, GET UP!
- BITCH!

24:05.878 --> 24:08.208
YOU FUCKING SON OF A BITCH.
- COME ON, CHILL OUT.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.817
- AH!

24:09.849 --> 24:12.049
- YOU FUCKING--
I'LL KILL YOU, YOU FUCKING...

24:32.572 --> 24:35.142
- WOW.

24:37.176 --> 24:41.246
YOU REALLY BUILT THIS PLACE
YOURSELF?

24:41.280 --> 24:43.950
- MOST OF IT.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.183
I'M GOOD WITH MY HANDS.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.517
[both chuckle]

24:46.553 --> 24:48.053
- YEAH, I'VE NOTICED.

24:48.087 --> 24:48.917
[breathes deep]

24:48.955 --> 24:51.185
I FORGOT HOW GOOD
FRESH AIR SMELLS.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.993
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE IN THE COUNTRY?

24:53.025 --> 24:55.625
- WE VISITED A DAIRY
IN THE THIRD GRADE.

24:55.662 --> 24:59.132
- THAT'S A LONG TIME.
[laughs]

24:59.165 --> 25:01.095
[horse neighs]

25:07.206 --> 25:12.136
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

25:12.178 --> 25:15.048
I'M JUST GOING TO THROW
THIS BAG UPSTAIRS.

25:23.322 --> 25:27.762
- SO DID YOU CATCH THAT FISH
OR CHALLENGE IT TO A DUEL?

25:27.794 --> 25:29.634
- I--I CAUGHT THAT
WITH SOME FRIENDS

25:29.662 --> 25:32.602
DOWN IN THE FLORIDA KEYS.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.640
- WHO'S THIS?

25:39.672 --> 25:40.842
- MY EX.

25:40.873 --> 25:44.843
- EX-SCUBA-DIVING INSTRUCTOR?
EX-FIGURE-SKATING PARTNER?

25:44.877 --> 25:46.947
- EX-WIFE.

25:50.216 --> 25:53.686
- SHE'S PRETTY.

25:53.720 --> 25:57.860
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE MARRIED.

25:57.890 --> 26:02.830
- YEAH, SEVEN YEARS.

26:02.862 --> 26:05.262
AND THAT IS MY SON HANK.

26:05.297 --> 26:09.867
HE'S 12 NOW.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.812
HE'S, UH, LIVING
WITH HIS MOM

26:12.839 --> 26:15.979
DOWN IN OREGON.

26:18.044 --> 26:21.784
I DON'T GET TO SEE HIM
TOO MUCH ANYMORE.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.184
- SO YOU WEREN'T
ALWAYS GAY?

26:24.216 --> 26:29.356
- NO, I WAS ALWAYS GAY.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.618
JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO ADMIT IT.

26:31.658 --> 26:35.228
AND BEING THE OVERACHIEVER
THAT I AM,

26:35.261 --> 26:38.261
I FIGURED THAT,
IF I WORKED HARD ENOUGH,

26:38.297 --> 26:40.367
I COULD BECOME ANYTHING
I WANTED,

26:40.399 --> 26:43.139
INCLUDING STRAIGHT.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.039
SO I MARRIED LORI.

26:45.071 --> 26:48.111
AND FOR A LONG TIME,
WE WERE HAPPY.

26:48.140 --> 26:52.380
BUILT THIS PLACE TOGETHER.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.111
BUT EVENTUALLY,
IT BECAME HARDER TO--

26:55.147 --> 26:58.377
TO DENY WHO I REALLY WAS.

26:58.417 --> 27:01.287
WHO I AM.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.289
SO I TOLD HER.

27:13.432 --> 27:17.872
I-IT WAS
THE ONLY FAIR THING TO DO.

27:17.904 --> 27:20.114
FOR EITHER OF US.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.379
- SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
REALLY UPSET.

27:29.048 --> 27:33.418
- AFTER WE SPLIT UP...
[clears throat]

27:33.452 --> 27:37.892
AFTER WE SPLIT UP, I PROMISED
MYSELF THAT I WOULD...

27:37.924 --> 27:41.934
WELL, THAT I WOULD BE HONEST
WITH ME...

27:41.961 --> 27:43.361
AND THAT I WOULD
ALWAYS BE HONEST

27:43.395 --> 27:46.325
WITH ANYONE ELSE
THAT I LOVED.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.270
WHICH, I GUESS,
IS WHY I'M TELLING YOU.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.186
WHOA.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.864
YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:17.329 --> 28:20.099
- MUST BE
ALL THIS FRESH AIR.

28:27.173 --> 28:30.143
[dance music]

28:30.176 --> 28:33.776
*

28:33.813 --> 28:35.953
- * WAKE UP

28:35.982 --> 28:37.882
* SHAKE YOURSELF AWAKE

28:37.917 --> 28:42.347
* YOU'RE REALLY HERE,
SO SHAKE YOURSELF AWAKE *

28:42.388 --> 28:45.418
* ARE YOU WITH ME?
ARE YOU WITH ME? *

28:45.457 --> 28:48.427
* ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

28:48.460 --> 28:51.230
- AREN'T YOU GOING TO DIVE IN,
JOIN THE FUN?

28:51.263 --> 28:53.033
- I ALREADY TOOK A BATH,
BUT IF YOU WANT TO JUMP IN,

28:53.065 --> 28:54.425
I PROMISE I WON'T LOOK.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.236
- YOU AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

28:56.268 --> 28:59.968
- HEY,
YOU TWO WALLFLOWERS.

29:00.006 --> 29:03.206
COME ON IN,
THE SUDS ARE GREAT.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.382
OH, HEY.
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.111
MY RUBBER DUCKY.

29:07.146 --> 29:10.476
QUACK, QUACK!

29:10.516 --> 29:13.016
- [laughs]

29:13.052 --> 29:14.852
THAT'S PATHETIC.

29:14.887 --> 29:17.317
- I THOUGHT STUDS IN SUDS WAS
YOUR FAVORITE CONTACT SPORT.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.556
- WHAT, A BUNCH OF FAGS SLIDING
AROUND IN THEIR SHORTS?

29:19.591 --> 29:22.361
- YOU ALWAYS SEEM TO ENJOY
YOURSELF WHEN MICHAEL'S HERE.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.834
BUT I GUESS IT'S NOT
AS MUCH FUN SCORING

29:24.864 --> 29:27.204
WITHOUT YOUR LITTLE AUDIENCE
OF ONE, IS IT?

29:27.233 --> 29:30.543
YOU KNOW, AS THE GREAT
FRENCH PHILOSOPHER ROQUEFORT,

29:30.569 --> 29:33.009
OR WHAT WAS IT CAMEMBERT,
ONCE SAID,

29:33.039 --> 29:34.869
"IT IS NOT ENOUGH
TO TRICK.

29:34.907 --> 29:38.847
YOUR BEST FRIEND
MUST ALSO GO HOME ALONE."

29:38.878 --> 29:41.408
- FUCK YOU.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.547
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT MICHAEL
ONCE TONIGHT.

29:43.582 --> 29:47.892
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
JUST LIKE WHEN HE'S HERE.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.360
- * ARE YOU LISTENING
TO ME? *

29:50.389 --> 29:53.989
- UH, UH, UH.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.486
- WASH MY BACK.

30:02.501 --> 30:06.171
- HEY.
REMEMBER ME?

30:06.205 --> 30:07.135
- WHY? SHOULD I?

30:07.173 --> 30:10.083
- WE DID IT AT THE BATHS
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

30:10.109 --> 30:13.409
- I MUST HAVE BEEN
VERY DESPERATE.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.275
- FUCK YOU.

30:15.314 --> 30:20.124
[chatter, laughter]

30:20.152 --> 30:23.522
WHO THE FUCK
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

30:28.494 --> 30:32.304
FUCK YOU!

31:25.684 --> 31:28.094

31:37.363 --> 31:38.973

THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.968
- [chuckles]

31:41.000 --> 31:42.940
AND THEY SAID I'D NEVER BE
ANY GOOD AT OUTDOOR SPORTS.

31:42.969 --> 31:45.939

31:45.972 --> 31:49.542

- OH, DON'T GO,
DON'T GO.

31:52.511 --> 31:55.581
- OKAY, BUT I HAVE TO WARN YOU,
A GIRL SCOUT TROOP

31:55.614 --> 31:57.684
COMES THROUGH HERE EVERY DAY.
- HOLY SHIT.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.286
- I'M KIDDING.

31:59.318 --> 32:00.688
I'M KIDDING.
I'M KIDDING.

32:00.719 --> 32:05.289
WE CAN STAY HERE FOREVER,
IF YOU LIKE.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.594
- I'D LIKE.

32:11.397 --> 32:12.457
YOU KNOW,
I WAS REALLY NERVOUS

32:12.498 --> 32:14.628
ABOUT COMING UP HERE
THIS WEEKEND.

32:14.666 --> 32:17.266
- OH?

32:17.303 --> 32:20.373
- BUT IT TURNS OUT
I HAD NO REASON TO BE.

32:20.406 --> 32:23.136
- GOOD.

32:23.175 --> 32:27.545
SO WE CAN GO AWAY TOGETHER
AGAIN SOMETIME.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.179
- MAYBE.

32:29.215 --> 32:31.515
- YOU EVER BEEN SKIING?
- NOT REALLY.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.520
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE IN NEW YORK?

32:33.552 --> 32:34.992
- LIKE, NEVER.

32:35.021 --> 32:37.291
- LONDON? PARIS?
THE AMALFI COAST?

32:37.323 --> 32:41.633
- TRY ATLANTIC CITY, 1983.
- MICHAEL. MICHAEL.

32:41.660 --> 32:46.200
THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD
OUTSIDE LIBERTY AVENUE.

32:46.232 --> 32:51.672
I'D LIKE TO SHOW IT TO YOU,
IF YOU'D LET ME.

32:51.703 --> 32:56.083
BUT FIRST...

32:56.108 --> 32:58.678
WE SWIM.

33:29.141 --> 33:31.481
WHEN THAT BEAR CHASED YOU
THROUGH THE WOODS.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.250
- BASKING IN THE AFTERGLOW
OF HAVING JUST MADE LOVE

33:34.280 --> 33:37.050
TO DAVID UNDER A TREE,
ASSHOLE.

33:37.083 --> 33:39.793
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
FALCON VIDEO PAC 77:

33:39.818 --> 33:42.118
MAN'S COUNTRY.

33:42.154 --> 33:43.624
- IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.415
I'VE NEVER HAD SEX OUTDOORS
BEFORE.

33:45.457 --> 33:46.527
- SURE, YOU DID.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.658
IN THE BACK ALLEY
BEHIND BABYLON.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.404
- I DON'T MEAN THE KIND
THAT TAKES FIVE MINUTES

33:50.429 --> 33:51.729
WITH YOUR PANTS
AROUND YOUR KNEES

33:51.763 --> 33:53.533
AND YOUR BUTT

- DANDY.
- YEAH?

33:59.771 --> 34:02.271
HOW WAS STUDS IN SUDS?
- BUBBLY.

34:02.308 --> 34:03.808
TOO BAD
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.442
- OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:05.477 --> 34:07.547
- NOTHING.
- YOU CAN'T FOOL ME.

34:07.579 --> 34:08.579
OUT WITH IT.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.284
- [sighs]
ONLY IF YOU PROMISE

34:10.315 --> 34:11.676
YOU WON'T LET IT
SPOIL YOUR WEEKEND.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.487
- MICHAEL, HURRY UP.
COME ON, IT'S WARM.

34:13.518 --> 34:16.159
- RIGHT THERE!
WHAT?

34:16.188 --> 34:18.158
- I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT,
THAT'S ALL.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.560
- WHAT KIND OF ACCIDENT?

34:20.592 --> 34:24.601
- I WOULDN'T FUCK THIS SCUMBAG,
SO HE RAMMED MY JEEP...

34:24.630 --> 34:26.170
TWICE.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.498
- CHRIST!
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:27.533 --> 34:30.172
- I HAVE A MINOR HEAD WOUND
AND A CONCUSSION.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.141
- OH, MY GOD!
- NOW, YOU PROMISED

34:32.170 --> 34:33.271
YOU WOULDN'T LET IT
SPOIL YOUR WEEKEND,

34:33.304 --> 34:35.405
SO DON'T YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT CUTTING YOUR TRIP SHORT

34:35.440 --> 34:37.181
AND COMING BACK HERE.

34:37.208 --> 34:41.149
YOU AND DOC JUST ENJOY
YOUR POKE IN THE PINES.

34:41.179 --> 34:44.420
BYE, MIKEY.

34:46.885 --> 34:49.355
- ARE YOU COMING IN?

34:49.388 --> 34:51.618
WHAT--
WHAT'S UP?

34:51.657 --> 34:54.087
- I HAVE TO GO BACK.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.266
[door opens, shuts]

35:06.372 --> 35:09.282
- MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE CAR?

35:09.308 --> 35:11.478
- SOME ASSHOLE IN A JEEP
BACKED INTO ME.

35:11.510 --> 35:15.380
- DID--DID YOU GET
HIS INFORMATION?

35:15.414 --> 35:16.224
IT WAS DARK, HONEY.

35:16.248 --> 35:19.848
HE DROVE OFF
BEFORE I COULD SEE HIM.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.785
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

35:21.820 --> 35:22.920
- OUT.

35:22.954 --> 35:25.624
- NO, YOU'RE NOT LEAVING
THIS HOUSE.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.527
- WHAT, SO NOW
I'M A PRISONER?

35:27.559 --> 35:28.759
- I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED
AT SCHOOL,

35:28.794 --> 35:30.934
JUSTIN, YESTERDAY.
YOUR PRINCIPAL CALLED.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.762
- SO?

35:32.798 --> 35:35.668
- SO? SO NOW YOU'RE FLAUNTING
YOURSELF IN FRONT OF EVERYONE?

35:35.701 --> 35:38.641
- I WAS NOT "FLAUNTING" MYSELF,
DAD.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.510
- BESIDES, CHRIS HOBBS
IS THE ONE WHO STARTED IT.

35:40.539 --> 35:43.339
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T CARE WHO STARTED IT.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.605
YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK THERE.

35:45.644 --> 35:46.784
- WHAT?

35:46.812 --> 35:49.882
- WE'RE SENDING HIM AWAY
TO SCHOOL.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.645
IT'S TIME YOU LEARNED
SOME DISCIPLINE.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.824
HOW TO BE A MAN.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.263
- I KNOW
ALL ABOUT DISCIPLINE.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.929
AND YOU SHOULD SEE ME
TAKE IT LIKE A MAN.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.558
- [gasps]
CRAIG!

36:01.593 --> 36:03.733
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, MOM.
IT DIDN'T HURT.

36:03.762 --> 36:06.472
IF YOU WANT TO HIT ME,
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

36:06.498 --> 36:09.368
ONLY I'M NOT GOING TO CRY
LIKE SOME LITTLE FAGGOT.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.671
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEND ME AWAY,
THAT'S ALL RIGHT TOO.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.613
'CAUSE I BET MORE BUTT-FUCKING
GOES ON IN BOARDING SCHOOL

36:14.640 --> 36:16.740
THAN IN THE BACK ROOM
OF BABYLON.

36:16.775 --> 36:20.805
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO,
IT'S NOT GOING TO MATTER

36:20.846 --> 36:25.446
'CAUSE I'LL STILL BE
YOUR QUEER SON.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.557
- [sighs]

36:38.864 --> 36:41.404
- HAVE SOME TEA.

36:41.433 --> 36:43.273
- AH, IT'S TOO HOT.

36:43.302 --> 36:44.972
- HERE, PUT THIS ICE BAG
ON YOUR HEAD.

36:45.003 --> 36:46.843
- THAT'S TOO COLD.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.442
- WHAT ARE YOU,
GOLDILOCKS?

36:49.475 --> 36:52.835
- TIME FOR YOUR TEMPERATURE.
ROLL OVER!

36:52.878 --> 36:54.848
[laughter]
[grunts]

36:54.880 --> 36:57.450
- YOU'RE NOT STICKING
THAT THING UP MY ASS.

36:57.483 --> 36:58.923
- JEEZ, THAT ACCIDENT MUST HAVE
REALLY JARRED YOUR BRAIN.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.720
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.
THAT ASSHOLE KEPT RAMMING ME.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.263
- DID YOU GET HIS LICENSE?
- IT WAS DARK.

37:04.290 --> 37:05.720
- WHAT KIND OF CAR WAS IT?

37:05.757 --> 37:06.887
- I DON'T KNOW,
SOME SILVER THING.

37:06.925 --> 37:09.995
- OH, MY GOD,
IT WAS MY DAD.

37:10.028 --> 37:10.858
I KNOW IT.
- WHAT?

37:10.896 --> 37:12.896
- I SAW HIS CAR.
IT WAS TOTALLY SMASHED.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.601
- HMM, NOW WHY WOULD YOUR FATHER
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

37:15.634 --> 37:17.744
- BECAUSE MY MOM
TOLD HIM EVERYTHING.

37:17.769 --> 37:20.539
HE WANTS TO HAVE YOU ARRESTED
AND SEND ME AWAY.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.272
- DON'T BE
A DRAMA PRINCESS.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.678
- YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL,
JUST IN CASE.

37:23.709 --> 37:27.349
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME,
I'M INVINCIBLE.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.349
- YEAH, YOU ALSO GOT
A CONCUSSION.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.881
- WELL, FUCK IT.
IT'S PARTY TIME.

- HEY, GUYS.
JOIN THE PARTY.

37:54.373 --> 37:57.083
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE REALLY HURT.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.348
- I AM.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.048
- MICHAEL INSISTED
WE COME RIGHT BACK.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.649
- I TOLD YOU NOT TO.

38:02.681 --> 38:05.981
- I KNOW, BUT...

38:06.017 --> 38:09.387
*

38:09.421 --> 38:13.361
- DON'T GO
AFTER HIM, MIKEY.

38:13.392 --> 38:16.662
DON'T EVER GO
AFTER ANYONE.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.100
- SORRY.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.837
- FOR WHAT?
- BRIAN.

38:28.874 --> 38:32.714
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE,
HIS MANIPULATIONS.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.414
- HE GETS A REAL KICK
OUT OF THAT, DOESN'T HE?

38:35.447 --> 38:38.947
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD JUST TURN,
WALK AWAY, AND NEVER COME BACK.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.654
- WELL, THAT'S ONE OPTION.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.686
UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU THINK
MICHAEL'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.921
WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DO.

38:44.956 --> 38:47.556
- THANKS FOR THE ADVICE.

38:47.593 --> 38:50.933
- I LIKE DOING PRO BONO WORK.
REMINDS ME I HAVE A HEART.

38:50.962 --> 38:54.532
- WHAT IS IT
WITH BRIAN KINNEY?

38:54.566 --> 38:55.926
I MEAN, SURE,
HE'S GOOD-LOOKING,

38:55.967 --> 38:56.997
BUT A LOT OF GUYS
ARE GOOD-LOOKING.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.395
AND HE'S GOT
HIS FUCKING CHARM,

38:58.437 --> 38:59.507
BUT WE ALL HAVE THAT
WHEN WE WANT IT.

38:59.538 --> 39:00.668
BUT WHAT IS IT WITH HIM?

39:00.706 --> 39:01.906
- I DON'T KNOW.
LINDSAY SAYS IT'S THAT

39:01.940 --> 39:03.580
HE'LL DO ANYTHING,
SAY ANYTHING,

39:03.609 --> 39:04.939
FUCK ANYTHING.

39:04.976 --> 39:07.776
NO EXCUSES, NO APOLOGIES,
NO REGRETS.

39:07.813 --> 39:10.753
- IN OTHER WORDS,
HE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT.

39:14.920 --> 39:18.690
[dance music]

39:18.724 --> 39:20.864

IS THERE SOME ROOM
ON YOUR DANCE CARD FOR ME?

39:51.723 --> 39:54.493
- SURE.
- NOT YOU.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.026
YOU.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.201

39:58.229 --> 40:00.599

YOU'D NEVER ASK.

40:00.632 --> 40:08.572
*

40:13.579 --> 40:17.919
- MAN, DAVID LOOKS HOT.

40:17.949 --> 40:22.649
- WHY IS HE DANCING
WITH BRIAN?

40:22.688 --> 40:30.828
*

40:32.898 --> 40:34.528
- YOU DON'T DANCE HALF BAD.

40:34.566 --> 40:38.196
- I DANCE DAMN GOOD.
HAVEN'T DONE IT FOR A WHILE.

40:38.236 --> 40:39.336
- YOU SHOULD GO OUT
MORE OFTEN.

40:39.370 --> 40:42.510
- YEAH, WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
HERE THAT INTERESTS ME.

40:42.541 --> 40:43.841
- THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

40:43.875 --> 40:46.575
- I CAME TO SEE YOU.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.650
YOU KNOW, FOR A GUY
THAT WAS ON DEATH'S DOORSTEP,

40:50.682 --> 40:52.052
YOU MADE
A REMARKABLE RECOVERY.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.823
- WELL, I BELIEVE
IN THE POWER OF PRAYER

40:53.852 --> 40:56.122
AND DRUGS.

40:56.154 --> 40:57.264
- I TOLD MIKEY
YOU'D BE ALL RIGHT,

40:57.288 --> 40:58.588
BUT HE HAD
TO COME RUNNING BACK.

40:58.624 --> 41:00.694
- WHAT CAN I SAY?
HE'S A SWEETHEART.

41:00.726 --> 41:02.656
- THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL
THAT MATTERS TO HIM.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.634
YOU'RE HIS WORLD,
HIS LIFE.

41:04.663 --> 41:06.773
EVERYTHING HE THINKS ABOUT,
EVERYTHING HE DREAMS OF,

41:06.798 --> 41:08.798
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.

41:08.834 --> 41:12.044
- HE'S MY BEST FRIEND,
SINCE WE WERE 14.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.870
- THAT'S 16 YEARS
OF WAITING.

41:13.905 --> 41:16.135
HE'S BEEN WAITING SO LONG,
HE ACTUALLY THINKS HE'S HAPPY.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.984
BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT HE'S NEVER GOING TO GET

41:18.009 --> 41:21.809
WHAT HE REALLY WANTS,
IS HE?

41:21.847 --> 41:24.047
- AND WHAT IS THAT, DOC?

41:24.082 --> 41:27.852
- FOR YOU TO FUCK HIM.

41:27.886 --> 41:29.186
AND DON'T TELL ME
YOU DON'T KNOW IT,

41:29.220 --> 41:31.120
AND YOU LOVE KNOWING IT,
DON'T YOU?

41:31.156 --> 41:32.856
- YOU'VE BEEN AROUND FOR WHAT,
A WEEK?

41:32.891 --> 41:36.261
YOU THINK YOU KNOW HIM?

41:38.630 --> 41:42.870
YOU DON'T.

41:42.901 --> 41:45.301
- I'D LIKE TO.

41:45.336 --> 41:48.806
BUT I NEVER WILL,
AS LONG AS YOU'RE AROUND.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.080
MAYBE I SHOULD
JUST DISAPPEAR.

41:52.110 --> 41:54.080
YOU'D PROBABLY LIKE THAT,

41:54.112 --> 41:56.882
AND HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T THINK
TWICE ABOUT IT.

41:56.915 --> 41:59.315
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.890
I'M NOT GOING TO DISAPPEAR.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.990
BECAUSE I WANT HIM...

42:05.023 --> 42:09.163
EVEN MORE THAN YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO HAVE HIM.

42:09.194 --> 42:11.834
SO IF YOU'RE REALLY
HIS BEST FRIEND,

42:11.863 --> 42:14.903
GIVE HIM A CHANCE
TO BE HAPPY.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.803
TO HAVE A LIFE.

42:16.835 --> 42:19.805
HIS OWN LIFE.

42:21.206 --> 42:24.776
LET HIM GO.
