00:00.083 --> 00:02.875
Hi. I'm comedian Tom Green
with a special one-time offer.

00:03.000 --> 00:04.325
Say yes now and receive a case

00:04.450 --> 00:06.812
of premium Canadian sausage
for only $39.99.

00:06.937 --> 00:08.247
Daddy, would you like some sausage?

00:08.372 --> 00:10.093
- Yes.
- [Beep] Magnificent.

00:10.259 --> 00:11.884
Now please enter
your credit card info

00:12.009 --> 00:13.096
using your touch-tone phone.

00:13.262 --> 00:14.887
- [Beep]
- And there you have it.

00:15.012 --> 00:17.923
Telecom intelligence
negotiating algorithm,

00:18.048 --> 00:19.102
or "Tina,"

00:19.268 --> 00:20.896
gives callers two offers

00:21.062 --> 00:22.661
in a variety of celebrity voices,

00:22.786 --> 00:24.232
as you just heard.

00:24.398 --> 00:26.899
Tom Green? You should have
got Scott Caan.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.100
Shut up, he's a huge celebrity.

00:28.225 --> 00:29.435
- Whoa, yeah.
- Watch it.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.198
Someone needs to put a muzzle on him,

00:31.364 --> 00:33.200
- 'cause I hate you.
- Uh, real question.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.745
If Tina is making the calls,
why are we here?

00:36.911 --> 00:38.277
Well, if Tina doesn't make the sale

00:38.402 --> 00:39.878
within the first two offers, then...

00:40.003 --> 00:40.999
Oh, I get it.

00:41.165 --> 00:42.751
Then we come in and clean bat up.

00:43.106 --> 00:46.852
'Cause this cold machine lacks
the soft touch of a human...

00:46.977 --> 00:50.175
touching a machine.

00:50.341 --> 00:51.635
It lacks human error.

00:51.801 --> 00:55.347
And Tina persists
where you would feel intrusive.

00:55.586 --> 00:57.933
Okay, so what's the catch?

00:58.099 --> 01:00.999
Well, if Tina does make the sale

01:01.124 --> 01:03.202
before your assistance is needed,

01:03.327 --> 01:04.815
you don't get the commission.

01:04.980 --> 01:06.338
- Just your hourly.
- What?

01:06.463 --> 01:07.776
Is this a joke?

01:07.942 --> 01:09.486
Uh, you know, I-I get it.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.071
Gonna be less work for us,

01:11.237 --> 01:12.572
and we're still getting paid hourly.

01:12.803 --> 01:13.912
Exactly, thank you, stretch.

01:14.037 --> 01:16.515
No, you don't get it!

01:16.640 --> 01:18.484
This is just the beginning, guys.

01:18.609 --> 01:21.487
All right, if we let
these machines take our jobs,

01:21.612 --> 01:24.623
next... next, they're
gonna take everything.

01:24.748 --> 01:26.725
Okay, Blake, you're overreacting.

01:26.850 --> 01:28.494
Overreacting?

01:28.619 --> 01:31.717
I'm pretty sure that
I'm <i>underreacting</i> right now.

01:31.883 --> 01:34.333
[Intensely]
Just imagine a future...

01:34.458 --> 01:36.802
Where robots replace humans,

01:36.927 --> 01:38.571
evolving to be faster, smarter,

01:38.696 --> 01:40.872
and just way more freaking doper.

01:40.997 --> 01:42.144
[Helicopters buzzing]

01:42.310 --> 01:43.909
Where humans become obsolete,

01:44.034 --> 01:46.312
and they're forced
by their ruler, Tina,

01:46.437 --> 01:50.816
to undergo a cyborg surgery
known as orientation.

01:50.941 --> 01:53.419
And it'll only be a matter of time

01:53.544 --> 01:55.551
before they come for us all.

Congrats, your bum will soon be

02:10.420 --> 02:11.882
on your very own

- Wow.

02:15.799 --> 02:16.908
Cool.

02:17.033 --> 02:18.930
Another sale stolen by Tina.

02:19.096 --> 02:20.557
And another one
of our commission checks

02:20.723 --> 02:21.530
stuffed into the pockets

02:21.655 --> 02:24.686
of Tina's real comfortable

02:24.852 --> 02:25.951
Oh, yeah, just face it.

Tom Green is Freddy-got-
finger-raping us all day.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.389
- Yeah.
- Oh, dude, check this out.

02:30.514 --> 02:32.861
Look what I snuck past
the last merry maids sweep.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.404
- Thank God.
- [Laughs]

02:34.570 --> 02:37.282
That huff, huff...
Huffy white heat.

02:37.448 --> 02:39.159
- Huff! Huff!
- Except for it's not hot.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.634
- It's actually very cold, so...
- It's cold.

02:41.759 --> 02:43.402
Just be careful with it, all right?

02:43.527 --> 02:45.165
- [Can sprays]
- Pretty cool, I guess.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.201
- [Phone ringing, Tina answering]
- Ooh!

02:46.326 --> 02:47.739
- [Coughs]
- That's crispy.

02:47.864 --> 02:49.275
[Stammers]
That's a nimbus cloud in there.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.043
I've actually done so much
of this stuff,

02:51.168 --> 02:52.923
I don't even think it really
affects my brain anymore.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.746
Is that right?
[Can sprays, stops]

02:54.871 --> 02:56.817
- [Incoherent mumbling]
- Hey, but don't hog it all.

02:56.942 --> 02:58.804
I know it's
gonna sizzle-fry my brain,

02:58.970 --> 03:00.722
but, I'm sorry,
this whole impending doom thing

03:00.888 --> 03:01.953
is really getting to me,
so if I could just have

03:02.078 --> 03:03.656
a huff of the hot...
uh... The heat?

03:03.781 --> 03:05.977
Well, you know, it's...

03:06.143 --> 03:07.479
Just abandon all hope here.
[Buzzers sounding]

03:07.645 --> 03:08.860
What the heck?
What'd you do, man?

03:08.985 --> 03:10.190
I didn't do anything.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.430
Mm.

03:11.555 --> 03:13.932
[Stammers]
We didn't do anything!

03:14.057 --> 03:16.488
Good. That's the way I like it.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.073
But that's all about to change.

03:18.362 --> 03:21.451
So, you've finally come

03:21.617 --> 03:23.703
to have me slave away in your vagina,

03:23.869 --> 03:25.477
as your sex slave.

03:25.746 --> 03:26.778
That's fine.

03:26.903 --> 03:28.314
I'll have sex with you.

03:28.439 --> 03:30.683
But I will never love you, Alice.

03:30.808 --> 03:32.504
I will never love you!

03:32.670 --> 03:34.520
Step aside, you troll.

03:34.645 --> 03:36.054
Oh, good one: Troll.

03:36.179 --> 03:38.257
- Yeah, right.
- I'm here for Blake.

03:38.382 --> 03:40.266
Oh, 'cause of his hair?
'Cause you're into trolls?

03:40.391 --> 03:42.729
No. Because it's time
for his orientation.

03:42.854 --> 03:43.974
Oh, fuck, sorry.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.851
Alice, please, I haven't
even lived yet, all right?

03:46.017 --> 03:48.478
I didn't even get to try
Carl's Jr.'s CrissCut fries.

03:48.644 --> 03:50.063
- Seriously?
- Yeah, you know.

03:50.229 --> 03:51.314
I'm an onion ring guy.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.692
Montez, Waymond, no! Don't!

03:53.858 --> 03:56.403
- Take me instead!
- Yeah, take him instead.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.244
I understand that Tina's
what's best for T.A.C.

03:58.369 --> 03:59.511
and I'm ready.

03:59.636 --> 04:01.780
I'm ready to become...

04:01.905 --> 04:03.785
an Oriental.

04:03.951 --> 04:06.619
[Intense electrical music]

04:06.744 --> 04:09.040
[Grunting]

04:11.208 --> 04:12.308
No!

04:14.050 --> 04:15.750
Sorry.

04:16.119 --> 04:18.091
Strap him to the table.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.759
I can't be a cyborg, man.

04:19.990 --> 04:21.803
They don't even have any cool...
they're just idiots.

04:21.969 --> 04:24.436
[Stammers]
They just have metal in their brains.

04:24.561 --> 04:26.772
If you had, like, a laser dick,
then, yeah, I'd be a cyborg.

04:26.897 --> 04:28.268
But there's nothing enticing me.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.587
Look, this is what we gotta do.

04:29.712 --> 04:30.709
We gotta go save Ders

04:30.834 --> 04:32.043
and get the hell outta
this hell, all right?

04:32.168 --> 04:33.203
Yeah, where are we gonna go, Blake?

04:33.328 --> 04:34.716
I don't know.
Let's freaking feivel it.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.151
- Let's go west.
- To the ocean?

04:36.317 --> 04:37.416
Sh-yeah, right.

04:37.541 --> 04:39.050
I'm not an ocean dog, okay?

04:39.175 --> 04:41.573
I'm a city cat.
[Meows]

04:41.739 --> 04:42.621
All right, fine.

04:42.746 --> 04:45.577
Let me think of another direction.

04:45.743 --> 04:46.661
- East.
- Yes.

04:46.827 --> 04:48.294
Let's head east, to the heartland!

04:48.419 --> 04:49.539
- Yeah.
- Vegas.

04:49.705 --> 04:51.249
- Vegas, I love it there!
- Right?

04:51.415 --> 04:52.498
- There we go.
- [Laughs]

04:52.623 --> 04:53.799
Now, let's ice our brains down,

04:53.924 --> 04:55.301
and formulate
a well-thought-out plan.

04:55.426 --> 04:56.546
- [Can sprays]
- Wait a minute.

04:56.712 --> 04:59.070
- What did you just say?
- [Mumbling] Hmm?

04:59.195 --> 05:00.383
Yes, that's it.

05:00.549 --> 05:01.635
The freeze part,
that's what I was thinking.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.475
The freeze part.
Dude, you're a genius!

05:03.600 --> 05:05.096
[Puffs]
I don't know.

05:05.262 --> 05:06.412
[Over speaker]
...using your touch-tone phone.

05:06.537 --> 05:09.448
[Can spraying]

05:09.573 --> 05:10.894
Both: Yeah.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.217
- There we go.
- [Grunts]

05:12.342 --> 05:13.438
Whoo! Oh! Oh!

05:13.604 --> 05:14.687
- Oh, sorry.
- That's okay.

05:14.812 --> 05:16.355
Hey, Adam, what comes after "l"?

05:16.480 --> 05:18.860
- I don't... I...
- Bow!

05:19.026 --> 05:20.528
[Both laughing]

05:20.694 --> 05:22.093
- Both: Oh.
- Shiz-off!

05:22.218 --> 05:23.729
- Dude!
- Oh, my God!

05:23.854 --> 05:25.698
I'm so excited about this.
We could... okay.

05:25.823 --> 05:27.285
- We could die doing this.
- Great, let's save Ders.

05:27.451 --> 05:30.101
We could die, this is exciting.

05:30.226 --> 05:31.770
I think we're good now. Ooh!

05:31.895 --> 05:33.583
- [Softly] Blake! Adam!
- Shut up.

05:33.749 --> 05:34.840
- Shh, shh.
- We're getting out of here.

05:34.965 --> 05:36.044
Take us with you!
Take us with you, man!

05:36.210 --> 05:38.338
- Yeah, save us.
- No, sorry, we can't.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.846
Yeah, but, um,
we're always gonna remember you,

05:40.971 --> 05:42.133
and we'll never forget you, so...

05:42.299 --> 05:43.415
Take this yo-yo.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.054
It belonged to my father.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.387
Television set.

05:48.512 --> 05:49.933
Give it to your sons.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.189
Very cool.
Cool yo-yo.

05:51.314 --> 05:52.624
Thank you, I'm gonna treasure this.

05:52.749 --> 05:54.437
- Don't go.
- Yep.

05:54.603 --> 05:55.826
Guys, please don't leave us, okay?

05:55.951 --> 05:57.607
I cannot survive in here.

05:57.773 --> 05:59.398
All right, I-I love you, Jet Set.

05:59.523 --> 06:01.600
But he shit all over the walls.

06:01.725 --> 06:03.535
- And I can't... this smell...
- You pooped on the walls?

06:03.660 --> 06:06.238
- I couldn't hold it no more.
- I can smell it now.

06:06.363 --> 06:08.451
- [Mechanical buzzing]
- I smell poo.

06:08.617 --> 06:09.703
I'm sorry, guys,
we'll come back for you.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.496
We gotta go.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.580
- [Grunting]
- Oh.

06:14.705 --> 06:16.882
It's okay.

06:17.007 --> 06:19.485
Relax, Holmvik.

06:19.610 --> 06:21.923
Once you've been oriented,

06:22.089 --> 06:24.790
all the fear, the emotions,

06:24.915 --> 06:26.425
they just disappear.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.460
Then why don't you try it?

06:28.585 --> 06:30.629
Because I run Telamericorp,

06:30.754 --> 06:33.499
and Tina answers to me.

06:33.624 --> 06:35.634
Prep the patient.

06:35.759 --> 06:36.855
What?

06:37.021 --> 06:38.136
What are you doing?

06:38.261 --> 06:40.358
What? No!
Oh, no!

06:40.524 --> 06:42.641
You're changing the molecular
structure of my flesh!

06:42.766 --> 06:44.321
Please don't!

06:44.487 --> 06:46.011
No, we're just shaving your body.

06:46.136 --> 06:47.212
Oh.

06:47.337 --> 06:48.450
[Laughs nervously]
Okay.

06:48.672 --> 06:49.748
Been there, done that.

06:49.873 --> 06:51.316
[Sing-song]
Spa day.

06:51.441 --> 06:52.537
[Laughs nervously]

07:01.420 --> 07:03.069
{pub}So, once we get to Vegas,

07:03.194 --> 07:04.723
thinking about doing
a Cirque Du Soleil show

07:04.848 --> 07:05.606
based on the music of Nelly.

07:05.731 --> 07:07.941
- Wait a minute.
- What?

07:08.066 --> 07:10.341
I mean, if Murphy Lee
and the St. Lunatics

07:10.466 --> 07:11.624
want to be involved, that's fine.

07:11.749 --> 07:13.886
But it's really...
it's Nelly's show.

07:14.011 --> 07:15.518
Tina's mainframe.

07:15.684 --> 07:17.818
That's where
the lifeblood's generated.

07:17.943 --> 07:19.019
Destroying the mainframe

07:19.144 --> 07:20.387
would wipe out the mind control

07:20.512 --> 07:21.655
of everybody who's been
oriented-tated.

07:21.780 --> 07:22.942
Very cool.

07:23.108 --> 07:24.458
We can't get in there, though,

07:24.583 --> 07:26.284
because we don't have
Alice's collar key.

07:26.409 --> 07:27.728
So let's just focus
on what I'm saying, okay?

07:27.853 --> 07:29.629
Let's go get Ders.

07:29.754 --> 07:30.992
Do you have air force ones?
'Cause you're gonna need those.

07:31.158 --> 07:33.661
Um, I have G Unit sneakers.

07:33.827 --> 07:36.164
Once ingested,
this probe will map your body,

07:36.428 --> 07:38.372
and we can begin the implant process,

07:38.497 --> 07:42.003
orienting you to Tina's mainframe.

07:42.169 --> 07:43.510
[Groaning]

07:43.635 --> 07:45.340
[Stifled screaming]

07:45.904 --> 07:47.008
[Gurgles]

07:47.174 --> 07:48.674
Yeah.

07:48.799 --> 07:50.762
Don't worry, you'll pass it soon.

07:50.928 --> 07:52.180
TMI.

07:52.346 --> 07:55.022
Position
the optical excavation device.

07:55.147 --> 07:57.457
Time to scoop out
them eyeballs, stretch.

07:57.582 --> 07:59.894
[Coughing]

08:00.019 --> 08:02.565
[Sobbing]
No!

08:02.731 --> 08:05.766
[Device beeps]
No! No, no, no!

08:05.891 --> 08:07.902
Watch eyes! Watch eyes!
Waymond, please, please!

08:08.027 --> 08:09.572
I know you can hear me!
Tell her to stop!

08:09.738 --> 08:11.658
[Device buzzing]
Don't let her do this!

08:11.824 --> 08:12.992
[Grunts savagely]

08:13.232 --> 08:15.703
Good thing yo-yo strings
are long as hell in the future.

08:15.869 --> 08:16.871
- [Grunting]
- Whoop!

08:17.037 --> 08:18.623
Just what do you think you're doing?

08:18.789 --> 08:19.999
We're escaping to Vegas.

08:20.165 --> 08:21.581
Unless you want me
to be your sex puppet.

08:21.706 --> 08:23.711
Put your hand up my ass,
make me talk.

08:23.877 --> 08:24.879
Come on, let's get out
of here! Let's go!

08:25.344 --> 08:26.423
Let's move! Let's move!
Let's move!

08:26.945 --> 08:29.056
Oh, yeah, and, Alice...

08:29.181 --> 08:31.392
We quit.
Both: Yeah.

08:31.517 --> 08:32.636
Yeah, we quit.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.306
Come on! Hup!

08:35.472 --> 08:37.558
After them now!

08:37.789 --> 08:40.067
[Edgy electronic music]

08:40.192 --> 08:41.479
Damn it.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.203
I am not running after them
in these heels.

08:43.328 --> 08:44.972
Let's head back to the office.

08:45.097 --> 08:46.573
We'll activate
the probe's tracking signal,

08:46.698 --> 08:47.942
and then we'll trigger
the defense mech,

08:48.067 --> 08:49.576
in case they try to discharge.

08:49.701 --> 08:51.239
Damn it.

08:51.405 --> 08:52.782
What are they talking about?

08:52.948 --> 08:55.349
They fed me this probe thing.

08:55.474 --> 08:57.051
Oh, my God.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.290
[Burbling]
I can feel it. Oh.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.914
Oh, God!

09:02.039 --> 09:03.390
It's too late to abort it,

09:03.515 --> 09:04.858
which is exactly what my mom used

09:04.983 --> 09:06.793
to say about me.

09:06.918 --> 09:08.333
I'm gonna have to murder you.
I'm gonna have to murder him.

09:08.458 --> 09:10.008
- No, Adam, no...
- Wait, wait...

09:10.133 --> 09:11.199
He's not Oriental ot Orient.

09:11.324 --> 09:12.135
Look at his eyes.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.345
You could tell he's Oriental
by his eyes.

09:14.511 --> 09:16.181
But we do got
to get that probe out of him.

09:16.347 --> 09:20.059
[Stomach burbling]

09:20.225 --> 09:21.603
- Oh.
- Oh, God. Ooh.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.021
I think I know how to get it out.

09:23.187 --> 09:24.397
Huh? What?
Both: How?

09:24.563 --> 09:26.613
- What are you...
- What are you doing?

09:26.738 --> 09:27.817
Yeah.

09:27.983 --> 09:29.736
Tracker on.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.071
Get to the supply closet now!

09:32.237 --> 09:33.487
[Beeps]

09:33.612 --> 09:36.034
Defense mech armed.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.161
- [Probe beeping]
- You hear that? I'm beeping.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.659
- Yeah, get it out, Ders.
- Get it out.

09:39.784 --> 09:40.747
- Can you hear it?
- Stop playing.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.373
I could kill him,
I could still kill him.

09:42.539 --> 09:45.210
- Yeah, man, this is an option.
- [Groaning]

09:45.376 --> 09:46.500
Oh, look.

09:46.625 --> 09:48.421
[Both screaming]

09:48.587 --> 09:50.471
Oh, my God, it's a tapeworm!

09:50.596 --> 09:52.606
I've had one of those.
17 feet long.

09:52.731 --> 09:54.541
Doctor told me I had
to quit eating raw ground beef.

09:54.666 --> 09:55.845
Which I did.

09:56.011 --> 09:57.111
For a while.

09:57.236 --> 09:58.312
It's not a tapeworm!

09:58.437 --> 10:00.114
It's the thing!
Obviously.

10:00.239 --> 10:01.882
- Yes, obviously.
- Right, totally.

10:02.007 --> 10:03.350
Come over here,
and help me get it out.

10:03.852 --> 10:06.239
- Keep pulling it out of your ass.
- All right, you're okay.

10:06.364 --> 10:08.441
- I think you... you got this.
- All right, uh...

10:08.607 --> 10:09.923
[Laughs nervously]

10:10.048 --> 10:12.237
All right, here we go.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.860
- Okay.
- Oh, wait, no, no, no.

10:13.985 --> 10:15.162
- Not a pretty view.
- Slow down, slow down.

10:15.781 --> 10:16.796
I think something's coming.

10:16.921 --> 10:18.595
Oh, yeah, no, that's it.
That's the probe.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.833
I see something.

10:19.958 --> 10:21.935
Yep, yep.
Oh, here we go!

10:22.060 --> 10:23.706
- [Groaning]
- We got some lights.

10:23.872 --> 10:25.239
[Squish]
All: Oh!

10:25.364 --> 10:26.473
- Oh!
- Ooh!

10:26.598 --> 10:28.521
We got it!
Destroy it, Adam!

10:28.646 --> 10:29.976
- Destroy it.
- Yep.

10:30.101 --> 10:31.512
[Grunting]
Okay.

10:31.637 --> 10:32.779
- You get it?
- Yeah.

10:32.904 --> 10:34.081
No, I hear it.

10:34.206 --> 10:35.649
It's still beeping inside of me.

10:35.774 --> 10:37.178
We're not done, guys,
it's still in there!

10:37.344 --> 10:38.919
[Over headsets]
To the left, hurry!

10:39.044 --> 10:40.454
And bring them back alive.

10:40.579 --> 10:41.975
Barely.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.690
- Both: Yep.
- It's still in there.

10:43.815 --> 10:45.159
It's still in there.
Okay, okay.

10:45.284 --> 10:46.521
Round two, here we go.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.231
- [Moaning]
- Yeah, no.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.896
You got it.
[Stammers] Keep it up.

10:50.021 --> 10:51.276
Good work.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.944
Yep, I got it snagged.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.404
[Screaming]

10:54.570 --> 10:57.490
[Skin ripping]
[All screaming]

10:57.656 --> 10:59.659
- Oh!
- Boy! Yikes!

10:59.825 --> 11:01.108
Yes, you're gonna have
a case of "the hemmies"

11:01.233 --> 11:02.370
after this one.

11:02.536 --> 11:03.544
Fissures and hemmies.

11:03.669 --> 11:05.081
You might never poop again, dude.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.580
Which would suck for me,
I love pooping.

11:06.705 --> 11:08.626
It's, like, where I get most
of my reading done.

11:08.792 --> 11:11.671
[Over headsets]
Great. You've got them cornered.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.423
You know what?

11:13.589 --> 11:14.721
Kill 'em.
[Laughs]

11:15.299 --> 11:16.328
No, guys...
guys, stop!

11:16.453 --> 11:17.302
Stop, okay?

11:17.716 --> 11:19.326
I'll just be a cyborg.
Forget it, all right?

11:19.451 --> 11:21.889
Just stop pulling things out
of my ass!

11:22.055 --> 11:23.433
Okay, I'll help.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.560
[Both grunting savagely]

11:25.726 --> 11:27.234
- Oh!
- There it is! There it is!

11:27.359 --> 11:29.035
Oh! Oh!

11:29.313 --> 11:30.471
Break it!
Hurry.

11:30.596 --> 11:31.838
Break it and destroy it!

11:32.107 --> 11:33.860
- Come on!
- [Screaming]

11:34.026 --> 11:35.121
Okay, it's indestructible.

11:35.246 --> 11:36.643
Don't we have, like, a steamroller

11:36.768 --> 11:38.178
or, like, lava or...

11:38.447 --> 11:39.480
[Door banging]
What do we do?

11:39.605 --> 11:42.382
[Probe beeping]

11:42.659 --> 11:44.184
Wait, what are you doing, you idiots?

11:44.309 --> 11:45.685
Finish them!
[Device beeping]

11:45.954 --> 11:48.388
They're heading down
the South hallway.

11:48.665 --> 11:50.324
[Beeping faster] They're
heading towards my office!

11:50.449 --> 11:51.628
Wait, they're coming for me!

11:51.794 --> 11:54.005
Get here now!

11:54.171 --> 11:57.671
[Probe beeping]

12:19.196 --> 12:20.155
{pub}Damn it!
It's Bill.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.857
We're not getting past him.

12:21.982 --> 12:22.867
He's so deadly.
Look at him.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.383
Ow!

12:26.519 --> 12:28.063
Um, mirrors.

12:29.389 --> 12:30.416
If we can find several mirrors...

12:30.582 --> 12:31.959
Shh, Adam.
Trying to come up

12:32.125 --> 12:33.294
- with an idea here.
- Dude!

12:33.460 --> 12:35.922
Hey, have you guys seen <i>Kill Bill?</i>

12:36.088 --> 12:37.632
Volume one or two?

12:37.798 --> 12:39.759
Volume now.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.345
[Shrieking]

12:44.938 --> 12:46.238
Aah!

12:47.558 --> 12:50.058
[Grunting]

12:50.811 --> 12:51.938
[Screaming]

12:52.104 --> 12:53.189
I got him!

12:53.355 --> 12:55.108
Bill!
Both: No!

12:55.274 --> 12:56.651
- Oh, sheesh.
- Ugh.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.319
All right.

12:58.485 --> 13:00.129
Bill! No!

13:00.254 --> 13:01.572
[Overlapping shouting]

13:01.738 --> 13:03.098
Adam, you can't kill them!

13:03.223 --> 13:04.325
Bill, he's still in there.

13:04.491 --> 13:05.567
He's just under mind control.

13:05.692 --> 13:06.902
- Yeah.
- Oh, I thought he...

13:07.027 --> 13:08.329
I thought he was like an evil robot.

13:08.495 --> 13:09.471
No! Oh!

13:09.596 --> 13:11.106
You didn't know.
He didn't know.

13:11.231 --> 13:13.375
Cyborgs are totally different
than evil robots, okay?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.477
- Think of <i>Robocop,</i> right?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:15.602 --> 13:17.255
He would have those flashbacks
to when he was a man.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.481
Oh, so he's actually...
he's half-human.

13:19.606 --> 13:21.092
- Yes, he's still human.
- I killed a human!

13:21.258 --> 13:22.552
- You killed a human, dude.
- Oh, my gosh.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.721
- Oh, sorry, Bill.
- Yeah.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.655
Okay, we hop over the fence.

13:26.780 --> 13:28.356
Hop on a plane, if they still exist,

13:28.481 --> 13:31.026
and be the kings
of the Las Vegas strap.

13:31.151 --> 13:32.594
Attention, Jillian and Jet Set,

13:32.719 --> 13:34.720
prepare for orientation.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.431
Your time is now.

13:36.556 --> 13:37.566
Jet and Jill.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.101
You guys, we got to do something.

13:39.226 --> 13:40.402
I know what they're about
to go through.

13:40.527 --> 13:41.603
Uh-uh, no.

13:41.728 --> 13:42.938
This is a trap.
This is trickery!

13:43.063 --> 13:44.206
This is Tomfoolery!

13:44.331 --> 13:45.440
Let's go to Vegas!

13:45.565 --> 13:46.742
[Helicopter blades whirring]

13:46.867 --> 13:47.943
Vegas!

13:48.068 --> 13:49.411
No, don't you see?

13:49.536 --> 13:51.346
This isn't
just about saving those guys.

13:51.471 --> 13:54.116
It's about taking back Telamericorp.

13:54.241 --> 13:56.919
Reclaiming the company
that gave us nothing.

13:57.044 --> 14:00.622
It's a dirty job, but...
Somebody's gotta Mike Rowe it.

14:00.747 --> 14:01.957
Hey, Blake?

14:02.082 --> 14:02.717
Huh?

14:02.883 --> 14:04.760
Fuck yo speech! Whoo!

14:04.885 --> 14:06.637
- You had to say that.
- Vegas!

14:06.803 --> 14:08.903
No! Aah!

14:09.348 --> 14:10.433
Help!

14:10.599 --> 14:12.101
Adam, I got you!

14:12.267 --> 14:16.438
[Both screaming shakily]

14:16.605 --> 14:19.007
Oh, I gotta...
I gotta get a gif of this!

14:19.132 --> 14:20.818
- [Screaming]
- Ders... Get... Us... Off!

14:20.984 --> 14:23.112
[Laughs]
Okay, all right.

14:23.278 --> 14:26.448
Ders, get me off!

14:26.573 --> 14:29.218
[Both screaming shakily]

14:29.343 --> 14:31.153
- Oh, my God!
- You think that was funny?

14:31.278 --> 14:32.454
- I'm sorry.
- You think that was...

14:32.579 --> 14:33.622
- let me see it!
- I'm...

14:33.747 --> 14:35.081
- let me see it!
- Sorry.

14:35.457 --> 14:36.191
Aah!

14:36.316 --> 14:37.626
Oh, this is funny.

14:37.751 --> 14:39.128
- Huh? [Laughs]
- This is actually really funny.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.671
- It's pretty funny, right?
- That was good.

14:40.837 --> 14:41.930
- Thank you.
- Okay, all right.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.331
Let's go back and save the day!

14:43.456 --> 14:44.926
End tyranny!

14:45.092 --> 14:46.268
Find the switch for the fence!

14:46.393 --> 14:48.304
Oh, I got a boner for some reason.

14:48.470 --> 14:49.872
All right, now we find Alice,

14:49.997 --> 14:51.173
and we force her to free the people.

14:51.298 --> 14:52.683
- Yep.
- Or...

14:52.849 --> 14:56.646
She forces me to fuck her
or whatever, huh?

14:56.812 --> 14:57.946
No, Adam, we have to stop her, okay?

14:58.071 --> 14:58.940
This ends now.
Come on, let's do this.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.649
Yes, that's a better plan than mine.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.610
Oh, damn.
Jillian's a fembot.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.552
- Really?
- Oh, they all are.

15:04.820 --> 15:05.988
Knuckle up, motherfuggers.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.289
- Mm, yeah.
- Why do you have that?

15:07.414 --> 15:08.699
- Yeah.
- Huh? 'Cause.

15:08.865 --> 15:10.192
- 'Cause why?
- Why?

15:10.317 --> 15:11.410
- It was in my butt, dude.
- That was in his anus.

15:11.576 --> 15:13.829
To study...
Because the, um...

15:13.954 --> 15:16.331
Just go fight your one,
already, please.

15:16.456 --> 15:18.533
- Yeah, go, you got him.
- All right, wish me luck.

15:18.658 --> 15:20.253
- Good luck.
- Whoo!

15:20.419 --> 15:21.379
[Screams]

15:21.929 --> 15:23.047
[Grunts]

15:23.213 --> 15:24.940
Whoa.
Whoo!

15:25.065 --> 15:26.641
You are a bitch, cyborg Montez!

15:26.766 --> 15:27.969
You are a bitch!

15:28.135 --> 15:29.470
[Screams]

15:29.636 --> 15:30.471
Sorry, Jet Set!

15:30.637 --> 15:31.889
- Yeah!
- Oh!

15:32.439 --> 15:34.939
[Grunting]

15:35.642 --> 15:37.752
- Oh, was that a roundhouse?
- You know it.

15:37.877 --> 15:39.387
Whatever happened
to roundhouses, dude?

15:39.512 --> 15:40.789
[Screams]

15:40.914 --> 15:42.859
I don't wanna do this, Jillian.

15:43.025 --> 15:43.860
[Grunts]

15:44.026 --> 15:45.027
- Oh!
- Whoa.

15:45.193 --> 15:47.613
- Oh!
- Blake, stop messing around!

15:47.779 --> 15:48.864
[Tight voice]
I'm not messing around.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.783
She's crushing my testicles.

15:50.949 --> 15:53.327
Ow!
Oh, oh.

15:53.493 --> 15:57.123
Let's see if I can crush
her testicles.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.389
[Grunts]

16:02.794 --> 16:06.094
Oh!
[Choking]

16:06.631 --> 16:08.593
Oh!
Oh, ow.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.011
Swim dive!

16:10.177 --> 16:11.387
Yeah... oh!

16:11.553 --> 16:12.988
[All grunting]

16:13.113 --> 16:15.600
Guys!
The xerox machine.

16:15.766 --> 16:16.851
Copy that.

16:17.517 --> 16:18.793
[Grunts]

16:18.918 --> 16:21.439
Attack!
Now! Eww, oh!

16:21.605 --> 16:24.032
[Grunts]
Come on, Demamp!

16:24.157 --> 16:25.901
Triple dude attack!
[Grunts]

16:26.026 --> 16:28.237
[Squish]
All: Oh!

16:28.362 --> 16:30.038
Oh, nice.
Come on, let's go!

16:30.163 --> 16:32.074
- All right.
- Oh.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.870
[All panting, grunting]

16:36.036 --> 16:38.713
[Mouth full]
Oh, hi.

16:38.838 --> 16:40.415
Sorry, I was just...

16:40.540 --> 16:41.584
I was just eating.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.091
{pub}All you had to do was
go through orientation.

16:49.257 --> 16:52.043
But no, you had to cause problems.

16:52.168 --> 16:55.973
Yeah, 'cause "cause problems"
is my middle name.

16:56.139 --> 16:57.849
Yeah!
And being a cyborg?

16:58.016 --> 16:59.385
Well, that's overrated.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.219
And that's something
I never thought I'd say.

17:01.344 --> 17:04.106
And we're here to put an end
to the reign of Tina.

17:04.271 --> 17:06.608
Good luck with that, stretch.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.328
[Beep]
[Energy shimmering]

17:09.453 --> 17:11.446
- All: Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

17:11.613 --> 17:13.398
Tom Green!
Wow, really big fan.

17:13.523 --> 17:14.742
- Really big fan.
- I'm a huge fan.

17:14.907 --> 17:17.569
[Metallic voice]
My bum is on the cheese.

17:17.694 --> 17:19.538
- My bum is on the cheese.
- Cyber Tom Green,

17:19.704 --> 17:22.083
that's... that's awesome,
but you need to shut it down.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.584
- Yeah.
- Because soon enough,

17:23.750 --> 17:24.876
the cyborgs,
they're gonna come for you.

17:25.001 --> 17:26.779
These machines would die for me,

17:26.904 --> 17:30.582
because they need me to survive.

17:30.707 --> 17:32.884
Oh, what, do you have
a problem with that?

17:33.009 --> 17:35.179
[Scoffs]
Kill them already.

17:36.980 --> 17:39.558
[Energy humming]

17:39.724 --> 17:41.824
All: Oh!

17:43.608 --> 17:45.494
- Swedish?
- Something happened.

17:45.619 --> 17:47.775
The machines!
They're taking over!

17:47.941 --> 17:49.485
- Now what are you doing?
- The key card!

17:49.651 --> 17:51.237
We've gotta get to the mainframe!

17:51.403 --> 17:53.364
[Grunts]
Screw it!

17:53.530 --> 17:54.981
Poor Alice,
she's never gonna bang me.

17:57.868 --> 17:59.044
Daddy, would you like some sausage?

17:59.703 --> 18:01.205
Daddy, would you like some sausages?

18:01.371 --> 18:03.207
Sausages! Sausages!

18:03.373 --> 18:05.084
Get in and barricade the door!
Barricade the door!

18:05.250 --> 18:07.820
[All shouting, panting]

18:07.945 --> 18:11.523
'sup, Tina?
You naughty little computer.

18:11.648 --> 18:13.384
Oh, I'm gonna drain you.

18:13.550 --> 18:16.220
I'm gonna drain you good.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.889
- [Screams]
- Come on!

18:19.055 --> 18:20.266
- Shut her down, Demamp!
- There it is!

18:20.491 --> 18:22.018
We can't hold him much longer!

18:22.184 --> 18:24.102
I'm trying!
It's much harder than it looks!

18:24.227 --> 18:26.981
All right, well...
try a "come hither" motion.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.074
Oh, I'm "hithering."
Oh, I'm "hithering," baby!

18:29.199 --> 18:30.275
"Hither" harder!

18:30.442 --> 18:34.112
Come on!
You come for me!

18:34.237 --> 18:35.364
[Energy hisses]
Both: Oh!

18:35.530 --> 18:36.682
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

18:36.807 --> 18:38.370
Please, not my face!

18:38.495 --> 18:40.327
- Uh, something's happening.
- Something good?

18:40.493 --> 18:44.189
Something... Beautiful!

18:44.314 --> 18:45.374
[Screams]

18:45.540 --> 18:47.209
[Epic music]

18:47.375 --> 18:48.475
Oh!

18:48.919 --> 18:50.880
[Screams]

18:51.046 --> 18:55.384
Oh, come on!
Oh, oh, oh.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.428
[Panting]

18:57.594 --> 19:01.098
Hey, uh, it's...
it's way over.

19:01.264 --> 19:02.340
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's...

19:02.465 --> 19:03.517
- yeah, we did it?
- Yeah.

19:03.683 --> 19:05.310
- You got him.
- [Laughs]

19:05.435 --> 19:07.946
Oh, no!
Oh, my God!

19:08.071 --> 19:10.315
We killed my hero.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.484
[Screams]
[All screaming]

19:11.742 --> 19:12.943
Jeez!

19:13.176 --> 19:15.487
Where am I?

19:15.612 --> 19:18.115
- I don't remember anything.
- Well, uh...

19:18.281 --> 19:19.591
- Well, you were a robot...
- Yeah.

19:19.716 --> 19:20.859
And then now you're...

19:20.984 --> 19:22.328
you're just normal-ass Tom Green,

19:22.494 --> 19:23.729
- which is pretty cool.
- Cyborg.

19:23.854 --> 19:24.955
Yeah, and actually...

19:25.188 --> 19:26.532
We are your childhood friends.

19:26.657 --> 19:27.900
- So...
- Yep.

19:28.025 --> 19:29.234
- Like, your best friends.
- Welcome back.

19:29.359 --> 19:31.069
- Yeah.
- What's up, buddy?

19:31.194 --> 19:33.380
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah, we do what we have to.

19:33.546 --> 19:35.372
- Thanks, guys.
- Hey! They're okay!

19:35.610 --> 19:38.811
- Uh-huh.
- [Laughs]

19:38.936 --> 19:40.221
Oh, my God.
We're heroes!

19:40.387 --> 19:42.414
Well, uh, I don't know about that.

19:42.539 --> 19:44.450
- We... we killed Bill, actually.
- Yes.

19:44.575 --> 19:46.418
Very sorry about that.
I did kill Bill.

19:46.543 --> 19:47.645
- Murdered.
- That was my bad.

19:47.811 --> 19:48.938
I murdered him.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.557
I actually hope he's banging
Alice's dead body in the afterlife.

19:51.682 --> 19:54.182
[Laughter]

19:57.120 --> 20:00.065
"Bang dead Alice"?

20:00.190 --> 20:03.369
- Oh, um... I meant...
- You know what?

20:03.535 --> 20:05.371
Shut up, okay?
Honestly, I think that was

20:05.537 --> 20:07.540
the dumbest story I have ever heard.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.500
I can't believe you let him
tell it for so long.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.477
This is just a prototype
for a pilot program.

20:11.602 --> 20:12.678
We're not gonna
be implementing anything

20:12.803 --> 20:14.947
for, like, another year.
All: Oh!

20:15.072 --> 20:16.348
Well, you should have
said that right away.

20:16.473 --> 20:17.583
Yeah, we're gonna quit by then.

20:17.708 --> 20:18.968
We'll probably be dead by then.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.986
Please, let's just get back
to the phones, now.

20:21.111 --> 20:22.888
- All right.
- All right, I swear to God...

20:23.113 --> 20:24.356
- Dude, I gotta try that!
- Right? That's got to...

20:24.481 --> 20:27.149
[Coughing, choking]

20:27.434 --> 20:28.594
Do not know.

20:28.719 --> 20:30.437
Jillian, are you okay?

20:30.603 --> 20:33.098
- Somebody call 911!
- Are you choking?

20:33.223 --> 20:35.033
- Get out of the way!
- [Coughing]

20:35.317 --> 20:37.528
- Blake!
- [Choking]

20:37.694 --> 20:39.237
- Help her!
- I don't know what to do!

20:39.362 --> 20:41.907
- Somebody help!
- Oh! Oh, God!

20:42.032 --> 20:43.701
- [Screams]
- Aah! Aah!

20:44.001 --> 20:46.702
[All screaming]

20:50.607 --> 20:52.209
All right, enough!

20:52.375 --> 20:54.712
God, Blake, do you ever shut up?
