00:04.062 --> 00:06.580
Hi, I'm Vanessa Baxter.

00:06.582 --> 00:07.915
Uh...

00:07.917 --> 00:09.508
Hello, my name

00:09.510 --> 00:10.993
is Vanessa Baxter.

00:10.995 --> 00:12.236
(VANESSA CLEARS THROAT)

00:12.238 --> 00:15.239
Hey! I'm Vanessa Baxter!

00:15.241 --> 00:17.908
Didn't we cover this on our first date?

00:17.910 --> 00:20.411
No, I'm working on my speech.

00:20.413 --> 00:22.188
All the candidates for state assembly

00:22.190 --> 00:24.673
have to make a formal
announcement by Thursday.

00:24.675 --> 00:26.250
- Okay, um...
- Yeah.

00:26.252 --> 00:27.526
Tell me what you got.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.420
Okay... (CLEARS THROAT)

00:29.422 --> 00:31.088
Hello.

00:31.090 --> 00:33.699
I'm Vanessa Baxter.

00:36.687 --> 00:37.934
Yeah.

00:37.936 --> 00:39.866
You know, that's the truth.

00:39.868 --> 00:41.766
Are you sure you want
to be a politician?

00:41.768 --> 00:43.692
You know, I just...

00:43.694 --> 00:45.452
I can't figure out what to say.

00:45.454 --> 00:47.605
I... I really need a campaign
manager, you know?

00:47.607 --> 00:50.274
Somebody who's smart,
organized, knows me really well.

00:50.276 --> 00:52.593
Well, I'm not gonna let you beg, okay?

00:54.781 --> 00:55.963
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Carol.

00:55.965 --> 00:57.205
So?

00:57.207 --> 00:58.756
I accept... I thought about it,

00:58.758 --> 01:00.977
and, yes, I will be your
campaign manager, yes!

01:03.623 --> 01:07.215
Oh, Carol, sure, Carol.

01:07.217 --> 01:08.459
Isn't this great?

01:08.461 --> 01:09.927
You know, maybe it's a sign.

01:09.929 --> 01:11.962
I mean, my first and
only choice said yes.

01:11.964 --> 01:13.114
Oh!

01:14.467 --> 01:16.391
Yeah, whatever, whatever.

01:16.393 --> 01:17.985
What?

01:17.987 --> 01:19.637
I don't know, got a little dizzy.

01:19.639 --> 01:21.622
Must be 'cause I got
knocked off my high horse.

01:30.149 --> 01:32.908
I am so excited to be
a part of your campaign.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.151
I can't wait to see you kick

01:34.153 --> 01:36.078
that old Ken Slattery to the curb.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.145
Yeah, well, old Ken is actually

01:38.147 --> 01:41.083
three years younger than
I am, so, yeah, okay.

01:41.085 --> 01:43.510
Vanessa, if we do this right,

01:43.512 --> 01:46.330
Slashin' Slattery would
have cut his last budget.

01:46.332 --> 01:49.108
Yeah, I'm gonna get some sugar.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.519
Speaking of sugar, you know,

01:52.521 --> 01:54.262
Vanessa's really sweet.

01:54.264 --> 01:56.765
Maybe her voters would respond to that.

01:56.767 --> 01:58.266
You know, f-food for thought.

01:58.268 --> 02:00.177
You know, honey, honey,

02:00.179 --> 02:02.179
you can stay and listen.

02:02.181 --> 02:04.515
I mean, you're gonna do that anyway.

02:04.517 --> 02:05.624
Well, great.

02:05.626 --> 02:06.867
You won't even know I'm here.

02:06.869 --> 02:10.277
I'll just roll my eyes quietly.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.538
Didn't you want some sugar?

02:11.540 --> 02:13.858
Never use it.

02:13.860 --> 02:16.360
Okay, so I think our tactic

02:16.362 --> 02:19.036
is to focus on the mess
that Slattery created

02:19.038 --> 02:20.698
and then just rub his nose in it.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.725
(GROANS)

02:28.416 --> 02:31.590
Uh, Mike, I-I think your eyes groan

02:31.592 --> 02:33.210
when they roll.

02:33.212 --> 02:35.654
You might want to have that looked at.

02:35.656 --> 02:39.141
I just don't think we can
sell Vanessa as a killer.

02:39.143 --> 02:41.143
I mean, she-she won't
even kill spiders, right?

02:41.145 --> 02:42.310
She catches them and puts them

02:42.312 --> 02:44.830
in the arachnid relocation program.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.315
(BOTH LAUGH)

02:47.317 --> 02:48.951
Oh, that's, that's good to know.

02:48.953 --> 02:52.062
Listen, is there a tennis
ball or something around here

02:52.064 --> 02:53.898
he could chase into the other room?

02:53.900 --> 02:55.416
(STAMMERS) You know what, though, I...

02:55.418 --> 02:57.492
I-I think Mike might be right.

02:57.494 --> 02:59.661
I'm just, I'm not that
comfortable with mudslinging.

02:59.663 --> 03:02.014
Um, but... that's not what
you're not talking about, right?

03:02.016 --> 03:04.332
Um, kinda am.

03:04.334 --> 03:05.926
If the mud fits, let him wear it.

03:05.928 --> 03:07.912
What, Mike?

03:07.914 --> 03:09.430
(MIKE SIGHS)

03:09.432 --> 03:10.931
This is Vanessa we're talking about.

03:10.933 --> 03:12.822
Vanessa, not some sharp-elbowed broad

03:12.824 --> 03:15.252
- from the roller derby.
- No, no, no, no.

03:15.254 --> 03:16.695
No, honey, nobody's trying to make me

03:16.697 --> 03:18.013
into something I'm not.

03:18.015 --> 03:20.925
Mm, kind of am.

03:20.927 --> 03:23.110
Vanessa, politics is a tough game.

03:23.112 --> 03:24.945
People need to believe you can play it.

03:24.947 --> 03:26.688
I don't know.

03:26.690 --> 03:28.282
- Hmm.
- Okay, why don't we just

03:28.284 --> 03:30.117
move this over to my house?

03:30.119 --> 03:32.027
And, oh, thank you, Mike.

03:32.029 --> 03:33.604
What for?

03:33.606 --> 03:35.131
Uh, staying here.

03:40.463 --> 03:41.870
Good morning, all.

03:41.872 --> 03:43.630
Good morning, Ed.

03:43.632 --> 03:45.132
"World's Best Boss".

03:45.134 --> 03:46.541
What a great hat.

03:46.543 --> 03:49.136
Thank you, thank you. A gift from Kyle.

03:49.138 --> 03:50.971
And I love it!

03:50.973 --> 03:52.139
It warms my heart to know

03:52.141 --> 03:53.586
that he was thinking
of me while he was...

03:53.588 --> 03:55.443
Waiting in line at the car wash.

03:57.956 --> 04:01.549
Well, I brought a little
something for you, Kyle.

04:02.651 --> 04:05.174
You, too, there you are.

04:05.176 --> 04:07.108
Wow.

04:07.110 --> 04:09.156
This looks really expensive.

04:09.158 --> 04:12.476
Makes me wonder where
you get your car washed.

04:12.478 --> 04:15.496
It's a special edition Krogen-Hauer.

04:15.498 --> 04:17.124
Oh, my God!

04:17.125 --> 04:18.832
Cardi B's husband gave her one of those

04:18.834 --> 04:21.168
when he slept with another woman.

04:21.170 --> 04:22.987
God, this is "I'm sorry

04:22.989 --> 04:25.914
I cheated on you" expensive!

04:25.916 --> 04:27.508
Come on, just-just put it on, Kyle.

04:27.510 --> 04:28.659
All right.

04:28.661 --> 04:30.494
Oh, wow, it's really...

04:30.496 --> 04:32.329
heavy.

04:32.331 --> 04:34.089
Well, that's because of the gold.

04:34.091 --> 04:36.066
And the rubies.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.354
You know, I-I don't think
I can accept this, sir.

04:40.356 --> 04:42.022
(LAUGHS) But you must.

04:42.024 --> 04:43.355
It's a Basque tradition.

04:43.357 --> 04:45.267
You see, you receive a
gift, you give a gift.

04:45.269 --> 04:47.511
What a wonderful tradition.

04:47.513 --> 04:50.364
I got this pen for you, Ed.

04:50.366 --> 04:52.625
(LAUGHING): Thank you.

04:54.870 --> 04:58.022
I'm sorry, Mr. Alzate, I-I can't.

04:58.024 --> 05:00.040
I see.

05:00.042 --> 05:02.815
So, you refuse?

05:02.817 --> 05:05.287
Mm-hmm, all right.

05:05.289 --> 05:09.291
Okay, you know, they say, uh,

05:09.293 --> 05:12.052
in 1793 a French general

05:12.054 --> 05:14.629
refused the gift of a flute

05:14.631 --> 05:17.465
from a Basque countess.

05:17.467 --> 05:20.044
And they all lived happily ever after?

05:20.046 --> 05:21.879
No, no, no.

05:21.881 --> 05:23.564
It was the start of the Pyrenees War.

05:23.566 --> 05:26.733
Thousands died.

05:26.735 --> 05:28.569
Then I guess, uh...

05:28.571 --> 05:31.247
I've got a new watch.

05:34.060 --> 05:36.410
- Hey, Baxter.
- What's up?

05:36.412 --> 05:39.487
Since Vanessa's officially
running for assembly,

05:39.489 --> 05:41.565
there's something important
I needed to show you.

05:41.567 --> 05:44.260
Yeah?

05:49.241 --> 05:51.925
(STAMMERS) What are you, a bobblehead?

05:51.927 --> 05:54.001
- No.
- Oh, I got it.

05:54.003 --> 05:55.579
We're playing charades...
you're an employee.

05:55.581 --> 05:57.339
An ex-employee!

05:57.341 --> 05:58.673
No, no.

05:58.675 --> 06:00.761
I'm a husband standing behind his wife,

06:00.763 --> 06:02.419
being supportive.

06:02.421 --> 06:06.014
You suck at being nice, so I
figured you needed a visual.

06:06.016 --> 06:07.941
So, Carol told you about

06:07.943 --> 06:09.443
the little brainstorming session we had?

06:09.445 --> 06:10.777
Mm-hmm, she mentioned a storm.

06:10.779 --> 06:12.596
Not so much the brains.

06:12.598 --> 06:15.599
I still don't agree
with Carol's tactics.

06:15.601 --> 06:18.102
But... Vanessa picked her.

06:18.104 --> 06:19.361
So I've got to...

06:19.363 --> 06:21.380
- do more of this.
- Oh.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.074

06:32.876 --> 06:34.635
What are you doing?

06:34.637 --> 06:37.045
I'm supporting you, girlfriend.

06:37.047 --> 06:39.957
(MUTTERING)

06:39.959 --> 06:42.359
Well, stop, it's creepy.

06:44.388 --> 06:45.963
Uh, Chuck, will you give me a minute?

06:45.965 --> 06:47.464
I just want to talk to Mike.

06:47.466 --> 06:49.992
He's all yours, future assemblyperson.

06:51.766 --> 06:53.789
So, how did the meeting with Carol go?

06:53.791 --> 06:56.140
Let me say this first...
I was thinking about it,

06:56.142 --> 06:57.491
I think you're right to pick her.

06:57.493 --> 06:58.900
I fired her.

06:58.902 --> 07:02.104
Ah, good, 'cause she was dead weight.

07:02.106 --> 07:03.756
Yeah, she was.

07:09.655 --> 07:11.413
Great, great. I'm glad you fired her.

07:11.415 --> 07:12.839
You know, I didn't want to say anything,

07:12.841 --> 07:14.508
but that brainstorming session...

07:14.510 --> 07:17.327
way too much storm, not enough brain.

07:17.329 --> 07:20.330
Well, I just didn't like the
direction she wanted me to go.

07:20.332 --> 07:22.799
Hmm, well, you know what I'm hearing?

07:22.801 --> 07:23.825
I'm hearing,

07:23.827 --> 07:25.836
"Mike, would you be
my campaign manager?"

07:25.838 --> 07:27.762
And once again, I'm
not gonna make you beg.

07:27.764 --> 07:31.283
Well, you know, you do know
me better than anybody else.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.285
And-and you are a marketing guy.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.862
Marketing genius... words matter.

07:35.864 --> 07:38.048
Okay, genius.

07:38.050 --> 07:40.766
Uh, so how-how would you sell me, Mike?

07:40.768 --> 07:42.202
What would your strategy be?

07:42.204 --> 07:45.439
All right, first off, I
wouldn't go with bulldog.

07:45.441 --> 07:46.496
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm, okay.

07:46.498 --> 07:48.300
If we're going that way, how about

07:48.302 --> 07:49.890
a beautiful Irish setter,

07:49.892 --> 07:52.196
and not the kind that
slobbers all the time.

07:52.198 --> 07:55.048
I'm not hearing the genius part.

07:55.050 --> 07:56.366
Give me a chance. I'm gonna come up

07:56.368 --> 07:57.701
with some great ideas for your speech.

07:57.703 --> 07:59.627
Okay, all right, um...

07:59.629 --> 08:02.206
Uh, look, just no, no
references to Reagan.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.631
- Okay?
- Okay.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.709
- Or Elway.
- Ooh...

08:05.711 --> 08:08.636
O-Or that orangutan from
the, the Clint Eastwood movie.

08:08.638 --> 08:11.532
You're taking all the
colors off my palette.

08:13.711 --> 08:16.660
Alexa, how many soldiers died

08:16.662 --> 08:18.646
in the War of the Pyrenees?

08:18.648 --> 08:22.484
<i>ALEXA: There were
27,374 combatants killed.</i>

08:22.486 --> 08:25.579
<i>With 20,844 killed from the side</i>

08:25.581 --> 08:28.749
<i>of the Kingdom of France,
Portugal and Spain.</i>

08:28.751 --> 08:32.594
<i>And 6,530 killed from the
French First Republic.</i>

08:35.424 --> 08:38.091
How many of them were wearing watches?

08:38.092 --> 08:39.743
Hi, babe.

08:39.745 --> 08:40.760
You're making dinner.

08:40.763 --> 08:42.169
I thought we were gonna order a pizza.

08:42.172 --> 08:43.914
Yeah, not a chance.

08:43.916 --> 08:45.932
Oh, hello, strange delivery man.

08:45.934 --> 08:47.476
Let me take that pizza from you.

08:47.478 --> 08:49.086
Why, yes, this is a Krogen-Hauer.

08:49.088 --> 08:51.922
Stabbed... you're a widow.

08:51.924 --> 08:54.199
Okay, this watch is making you crazy.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.109
Maybe you should take it
off for a little while.

08:56.111 --> 08:57.261
What, and put it where?

08:57.263 --> 08:58.612
On the windowsill like a pie,

08:58.614 --> 08:59.687
where any hobo could see it?

08:59.689 --> 09:01.689
Stabbed... you're a widow!

09:01.691 --> 09:04.151
Is there any version
of owning this watch

09:04.153 --> 09:05.193
where you don't get stabbed?

09:05.195 --> 09:07.271
Oh, sure, yeah, and unicorns are real.

09:07.273 --> 09:08.939
Wake up.

09:08.941 --> 09:10.624
Okay, you need to settle down, honey.

09:10.626 --> 09:11.792
Come on.

09:11.794 --> 09:13.293
It's just too much stress.

09:13.295 --> 09:15.112
I don't know how rich people do it.

09:15.114 --> 09:17.264
Well, a lot of them wear replicas

09:17.266 --> 09:19.707
when they're out and about,
or they hire a look-alike

09:19.709 --> 09:22.877
to wear the expensive one,
and <i> they</i> get stabbed.

09:22.879 --> 09:24.805
Where can I get a replica?

09:24.807 --> 09:27.457
Uh, of the watch, not of myself.

09:27.459 --> 09:29.975
Uh, downtown... they
sell cheesy knockoffs

09:29.977 --> 09:31.628
that look just like the real thing.

09:31.630 --> 09:33.297
I can't go down there wearing this.

09:33.299 --> 09:35.982
I'll end up like Batman's parents.

09:35.984 --> 09:38.635
Let me guess... they were stabbed?

09:38.637 --> 09:39.803
No, shot.

09:39.805 --> 09:42.806
He's an orphan.

09:42.808 --> 09:44.398
MIKE: <i>All right.</i>

09:44.400 --> 09:46.952
I got the strategy all
worked out for your campaign.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.979
You follow this road
map and you'll go right

09:48.981 --> 09:50.664
to the State House.

09:50.666 --> 09:51.832
This is so exciting.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.817
A real American election.

09:53.819 --> 09:56.911
When do we start colluding?

09:56.913 --> 09:59.747
(LAUGHS) Uh, let's see what you have.

09:59.749 --> 10:02.434
All right, this is your campaign
declaration speech, all right?

10:02.436 --> 10:04.828
And then, this is at the
Gettysburg Address level,

10:04.830 --> 10:06.754
but a few tweaks, we're right to

10:06.756 --> 10:08.832
"We can tear down that wall".

10:08.834 --> 10:09.834
(CHUCKLES): Okay.

10:10.836 --> 10:12.002
Oh, huh.

10:12.004 --> 10:13.478
Yeah, I got her hooked.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.355
Huh.

10:15.357 --> 10:16.673
What's that one "huh" for?

10:16.675 --> 10:17.932
Why do you need a pen?

10:17.934 --> 10:19.451
You don't need a pen there.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.027
Better. May I?

10:21.029 --> 10:23.864
No, you may not.

10:23.866 --> 10:25.607
- Ladies?
- Oh, yeah, closer, closer.

10:25.609 --> 10:27.517
- Closer to what?
- Yeah, but what about this here?

10:27.519 --> 10:29.019
Yeah. Oh, okay.

10:29.021 --> 10:32.873
Oh, my God, now it makes sense.

10:32.875 --> 10:34.858
What, what the hell's going on here?

10:34.860 --> 10:36.693
Well, you said it needed tweaks.

10:36.695 --> 10:38.637
I was being modest.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.431
Like when you compared it
to the Gettysburg Address?

10:42.701 --> 10:44.701
Look, I'm sorry, Mike.
I'm just trying to find

10:44.703 --> 10:46.127
a tone that feels right for me.

10:46.129 --> 10:48.630
I mean, you had me say
"care" an awful lot.

10:48.632 --> 10:50.874
Let's put a pin in the
speech for a minute.

10:50.876 --> 10:52.091
I can make some adjustments.

10:52.093 --> 10:53.894
Moving on, I think we need a slogan.

10:53.896 --> 10:55.379
Right? On a bumper sticker.

10:55.381 --> 10:56.638
Real simple. I've got some here.

10:56.640 --> 11:00.475
"Baxter... Better Schools
for a Better Tomorrow".

11:00.477 --> 11:01.493
Mm.

11:01.495 --> 11:04.538
All right. "Baxter...
Putting Students First".

11:04.540 --> 11:05.629
But you got the right finger up.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.391
Make sure you got the
right finger, right?

11:07.393 --> 11:09.226
"Baxter..."

11:09.228 --> 11:11.040
Nah, you... No, no, no. They're great,

11:11.042 --> 11:12.579
they're all great, but, you
know, I'm-I'm just starting

11:12.581 --> 11:14.468
to feel like I don't
really want a slogan.

11:14.470 --> 11:16.082
You got to have a
slogan. Everybody had one.

11:16.084 --> 11:17.901
Clinton had a famous
one: "I'd like to touch

11:17.903 --> 11:20.070
each and every one of you".

11:20.072 --> 11:21.405
All right, look, you know what,

11:21.407 --> 11:22.906
I mean, if-i-if I did have a slogan,

11:22.908 --> 11:24.349
it would be something like, uh,

11:24.351 --> 11:25.592
uh, "Baxter..."

11:25.594 --> 11:26.760
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Okay.

11:26.762 --> 11:28.503
"Uh, she understands...

11:28.505 --> 11:29.930
the-the real needs

11:29.932 --> 11:32.766
of-of-of Colorado's teachers...

11:32.768 --> 11:34.676
oh, and students, uh,

11:34.678 --> 11:36.177
um, uh, many of which

11:36.179 --> 11:38.755
are the result of-of
chronic underfunding".

11:38.757 --> 11:39.923
Wow.

11:39.925 --> 11:41.091
I liked it.

11:41.093 --> 11:42.759
(VANESSA MUTTERS)

11:42.761 --> 11:44.928
- Okay, l-let's forget about the slogan.
- Okay,

11:44.930 --> 11:47.280
look, honey, the issues
are just way more complex,

11:47.282 --> 11:50.434
and my ideas are too
nuanced to fit onto a bumper.

11:50.436 --> 11:53.787
"Mr. Baxter... Back
to the Drawing Board".

11:53.789 --> 11:55.952
Listen, marketing is what I
do. If you don't like the way

11:55.954 --> 11:58.726
I'm doing it, maybe... maybe we
shouldn't be working together.

11:58.728 --> 12:00.643
- Okay. Yeah, you're right.
- All right.

12:00.645 --> 12:01.945
- You're right.
- Thanks, baby, thanks.

12:01.947 --> 12:03.046
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

12:03.048 --> 12:04.539
Yeah, you know what? (CHUCKLES)

12:04.541 --> 12:06.642
We shouldn't work
together. You're fired.

12:11.123 --> 12:12.973
Don't feel bad, Mr. Baxter.

12:12.975 --> 12:15.809
I thought what you
wrote was a good start.

12:15.811 --> 12:17.297
Oh, look at this bumper sticker...

12:17.299 --> 12:18.478
I thought this was a great one.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.198
"Honk if you can exchange
my exchange student".

12:31.055 --> 12:32.527
Thanks for coming over for coffee.

12:32.529 --> 12:34.902
I've even given you my favorite mug.

12:34.904 --> 12:35.979
Aw.

12:35.981 --> 12:37.998
I'm busy. Why am I here?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.922
So, the principal gets
right to it, doesn't she?

12:40.924 --> 12:43.077
My day is an assembly line of jackasses.

12:43.079 --> 12:46.323
It's just your turn
on the conveyor belt.

12:46.325 --> 12:49.042
I just think it's weird
that she fired both of us.

12:49.044 --> 12:51.217
Oh, come on, you didn't <i>
really</i> think it was weird

12:51.219 --> 12:52.800
until she fired you.

12:52.802 --> 12:54.831
Correct.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.424
Because you're perfect.

12:56.426 --> 12:58.184
Correct.

12:58.186 --> 13:01.312
But isn't it odd that we both
came from different perspectives

13:01.314 --> 13:02.856
and she didn't like either one of them?

13:02.858 --> 13:03.931
Yeah, that is kind of weird.

13:03.933 --> 13:05.525
And why is that?

13:05.527 --> 13:08.194
Well, maybe Vanessa doesn't
really know what she wants.

13:08.196 --> 13:09.679
Does that really sound like Vanessa?

13:09.681 --> 13:10.772
- Oh.
- Hey.

13:10.774 --> 13:12.365
Hey, Carol.

13:12.367 --> 13:14.108
Mike.

13:14.110 --> 13:17.020
- Gee, isn't this fun.
- MIKE: Uh-huh.

13:17.022 --> 13:19.189
What... what are you guys doing?

13:19.191 --> 13:21.041
Well, we're having a little reunion.

13:21.043 --> 13:24.094
- Did you fire anybody else, or can we get started?
- All right.

13:26.381 --> 13:28.865
Uh, look, I-I can understand
why you're upset,

13:28.867 --> 13:30.792
but-but I had my reasons.

13:30.794 --> 13:32.126
Which are?

13:32.128 --> 13:34.871
Neither of you were
saying what I want to say.

13:34.873 --> 13:36.706
Which is?

13:36.708 --> 13:38.039
I know what I want to say.

13:38.041 --> 13:40.377
I just don't know how to say it.

13:40.379 --> 13:42.546
Do what I do... just open your mouth,

13:42.548 --> 13:44.714
and stuff comes out.

13:44.716 --> 13:46.140
I don't get it, Vanessa.

13:46.142 --> 13:47.888
You were a high-powered executive.

13:47.890 --> 13:50.387
You run your own
successful tutoring company.

13:50.389 --> 13:53.056
You've never been afraid
to speak your mind before.

13:53.058 --> 13:54.708
- Well, this is different.
- Why?

13:55.850 --> 13:58.372
Because if I say it
wrong the first time,

13:58.374 --> 13:59.563
by the time I say it right,

13:59.565 --> 14:01.823
I-I'm afraid no one will be listening.

14:01.825 --> 14:05.493
Wow. You just turned this into
the most important speech ever.

14:05.495 --> 14:07.495
Good luck with that.

14:07.497 --> 14:09.573
Look, don't think of it as a speech.

14:09.575 --> 14:12.075
Whenever you talked about
why you wanted to do this,

14:12.077 --> 14:14.094
it just made sense... so just talk.

14:14.096 --> 14:17.039
Or, like I said, just
talk until it comes to you.

14:17.041 --> 14:19.325
And when the jackass on
the conveyor belt is right,

14:19.327 --> 14:20.327
he is right.

14:26.091 --> 14:28.758
Hey, guys. Fire drill today at 4:00.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.686
And then a review at 4:30.

14:31.688 --> 14:33.930
Wow. Nice watch, Kyle.

14:33.932 --> 14:35.599
Thanks, Chuck.

14:35.601 --> 14:37.951
This is a gift from the
World's Greatest Boss.

14:37.953 --> 14:41.845
Oh, wait, Ed got you a-a Krogen-Hauer?

14:41.847 --> 14:43.625
You're damn right. I'm glad to see

14:43.627 --> 14:45.108
you're getting used to wearing it, Kyle.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.943
Yeah, yeah, I decided to wear the watch

14:46.945 --> 14:48.470
and not let the watch wear me.

14:49.781 --> 14:51.080
That is a handsome watch.

14:51.082 --> 14:52.115
Let me get a closer look.

14:52.117 --> 14:54.618
- Yeah, here you go.
- Yeah. Wait.

14:54.620 --> 14:56.956
Okay, okay, let me see it
a little bit closer, Kyle.

14:56.958 --> 14:58.163
You know, it's better from a distance.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.956
You know, in fact, I
wish my arm was longer.

14:59.958 --> 15:01.958
Come on, show the man
the goods. Come on...

15:01.960 --> 15:05.462
So, yeah, this is what it would
look like if I was swimming.

15:05.464 --> 15:07.638
Ah, it's pretty standard.
Just, you know, numbers,

15:07.640 --> 15:08.890
hands, solid gold.

15:08.892 --> 15:09.983
Uh...

15:09.985 --> 15:12.560
this says "Krappen-Haller".

15:12.562 --> 15:14.562
This is a fake, Ed.

15:14.564 --> 15:16.047
Let me see that.

15:17.567 --> 15:21.327
Braised brisket à la mode,
I've been swindled.

15:21.329 --> 15:24.497
Are you sure? I mean, even
watchmakers make typos.

15:24.499 --> 15:26.499
- I'll put that jeweler out of business.
- No.

15:26.501 --> 15:28.151
Don't. Don't.

15:28.153 --> 15:30.987
I got this downtown for $20.

15:30.989 --> 15:33.974
Mm. I could've got you a Crolex for ten.

15:35.327 --> 15:37.251
Did you pawn the watch, Kyle?

15:37.253 --> 15:39.162
What's got you, son?

15:39.164 --> 15:41.231
The ponies? The pills? Come on.

15:42.517 --> 15:44.334
No, it's-it's hidden away at home.

15:44.336 --> 15:46.002
It made me too nervous to wear.

15:46.004 --> 15:48.095
I'm not a fancy watch kinda guy.

15:48.097 --> 15:51.265
Ketchup? Yeah.

15:51.267 --> 15:53.898
All right, I'll-I'll take it back.

15:53.900 --> 15:56.346
I'll keep it until such time
that you want to wear it again.

15:56.348 --> 15:58.181
I just wanted you to know how...

15:58.183 --> 16:00.107
how much you mean to me, that's all.

16:00.109 --> 16:02.502
I don't need a watch to know that, sir.

16:04.039 --> 16:06.039
You know,<i> I</i> would have no trouble at all

16:06.041 --> 16:07.716
wearing a fancy watch.

16:08.839 --> 16:11.285
Well, can I interest you
in a, uh, Krappen-Haller?

16:11.287 --> 16:12.746
- Hmm.
- Just a word of warning,

16:12.748 --> 16:14.789
it will turn your wrist green.

16:14.791 --> 16:16.032
(SIGHS)

16:16.034 --> 16:17.534
I'll take it.

16:17.536 --> 16:19.961
My brother-in-law is
retiring next month.

16:19.963 --> 16:21.387
(CHUCKLES)

16:21.389 --> 16:24.983
He's the cheap S.O.B.
who gave me the Crolex.

16:29.639 --> 16:32.215
Mike. Mike.

16:32.217 --> 16:35.051
Do you think we inspired
her or crushed her spirit?

16:35.053 --> 16:36.553
- Vanessa?
- Yeah.

16:36.555 --> 16:39.072
I've never seen her this confident.

16:39.074 --> 16:41.057
What was I thinking
in writing this myself?

16:41.059 --> 16:43.059
It doesn't make sense.

16:43.061 --> 16:44.227
Do-do you, do you still have

16:44.229 --> 16:45.754
that crappy speech you wrote for me?

16:46.987 --> 16:48.843
Honey, you're gonna be
fine. You got plenty...

16:48.845 --> 16:51.251
Yeah, no, no, what do you
know? Carol, Carol, uh, um,

16:51.253 --> 16:53.494
g-give me some mud to sling at Slattery.

16:53.496 --> 16:55.496
Something like, uh,

16:55.498 --> 16:58.908
"His mama is so fat", and
then you, "How fat is she?"

16:58.910 --> 17:01.335
N-No, baby, that's not your brand.

17:01.337 --> 17:04.005
(GROANS) See, this is
why I fired you two.

17:04.007 --> 17:05.644
- Vanessa?
- What? What?

17:05.646 --> 17:07.319
What-what is it? What do you want?

17:07.320 --> 17:10.103
I just wanted to say
I'm so proud of you.

17:10.105 --> 17:12.179
Because where I come from,

17:12.181 --> 17:15.425
what you're about to do is a dream.

17:15.426 --> 17:17.260
Thanks.

17:17.262 --> 17:18.944
Thanks, Jen. (CHUCKLES)

17:18.946 --> 17:20.372
Okay, uh...

17:25.771 --> 17:27.794
Uh...

17:27.796 --> 17:30.360
uh, uh, so, uh, thank you so much

17:30.362 --> 17:31.866
for joining me today.

17:31.868 --> 17:33.443
Uh...

17:33.445 --> 17:37.463
people ask why I am
running for state assembly,

17:37.465 --> 17:39.874
and I want to run

17:39.876 --> 17:42.209
because I understand...

17:42.211 --> 17:44.788
the real needs...

17:44.790 --> 17:46.982
o-of Colorado's teachers.

17:48.217 --> 17:49.985
Oh, and students.

17:51.220 --> 17:52.962
(CLENCHED): This is not a good start.

17:52.964 --> 17:55.315
(QUIETLY): Honey, no bumper stickers.

17:55.317 --> 17:57.391
(SIGHS)

17:57.393 --> 17:59.244
(MUTTERING)

18:02.127 --> 18:04.742
You know... let me, let me start over.

18:04.744 --> 18:05.927
Um...

18:09.164 --> 18:10.663
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

18:10.665 --> 18:12.348
You know, I-I...

18:12.350 --> 18:15.168
I have so many memories
of being at this school.

18:15.170 --> 18:18.531
I mean, my three girls
graduated from this school,

18:18.533 --> 18:20.523
and-and I have another one

18:20.525 --> 18:24.160
who's about to do the
same thing this year.

18:24.162 --> 18:26.663
Look, I-I-I recognize a lot of you.

18:26.665 --> 18:28.940
You-you have all been
here for your kids, too.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.591
Because...

18:30.593 --> 18:33.427
because that's what we do
for our children, right?

18:33.429 --> 18:34.929
I mean, we want to help them.

18:34.931 --> 18:37.602
We-we want to encourage them.
We... we want to tell them

18:37.604 --> 18:39.266
we believe in them.

18:39.268 --> 18:41.435
And-and that's what I want

18:41.437 --> 18:43.863
from the people in the
state assembly, too.

18:43.865 --> 18:47.125
And i-if they're not gonna
do that, then you know what?

18:47.127 --> 18:49.777
It's time to make way
for someone who will.

18:49.779 --> 18:52.355
Look, do I have all the answers?

18:52.357 --> 18:54.632
I can't promise you that, but...

18:54.634 --> 18:56.709
but I will listen to you

18:56.711 --> 18:58.452
and I will work with you

18:58.454 --> 19:02.048
and I-I will do everything
I can to find those answers.

19:02.050 --> 19:04.217
That I can promise you.

19:04.219 --> 19:06.536
So I am here today

19:06.538 --> 19:10.297
to ask you to please help
me start this process.

19:10.299 --> 19:12.892
Because our kids...

19:12.894 --> 19:15.378
are worth it.

19:15.380 --> 19:18.806
And that's why I want to
run for state assembly.

19:18.808 --> 19:20.675
So, hello.

19:20.677 --> 19:23.286
My name is Vanessa Baxter.

19:24.313 --> 19:26.331
Damn. It <i> did</i> come to her.

19:27.984 --> 19:30.627
For a jackass, you are pretty smart.

19:38.236 --> 19:40.161
Hey, Mike Baxter for Outdoor Man,

19:40.163 --> 19:42.163
and a word about Gestalt theory.

19:42.165 --> 19:43.573
Or, as it's summarized,

19:43.575 --> 19:46.518
"The whole is more than
the sum of its parts".

19:46.520 --> 19:49.078
Like chocolate and peanut butter. Mmm.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.264
Or... peanut butter and jelly.

19:51.266 --> 19:54.434
Uh, or peanut butter and
marshmallow. (CHUCKLES)

19:54.436 --> 19:58.748
Damn, peanut butter's
got range, doesn't it?

19:58.750 --> 20:00.607
History is filled with combinations

20:00.609 --> 20:02.091
that made each other better.

20:02.093 --> 20:05.390
Alexander Hamilton,
James Madison and John Jay

20:05.392 --> 20:07.931
were all decent solo artists,
but when they got together,

20:07.933 --> 20:10.132
they created <i>The Federalist Papers.</i>

20:10.134 --> 20:12.526
Now, that's an album that holds up, boy.

20:12.528 --> 20:15.121
Speaking of sweet
sounds, Reginald Dwight...

20:15.123 --> 20:16.864
good piano player.

20:16.866 --> 20:18.866
Bernie Taupin... quite a wordsmith.

20:18.868 --> 20:20.293
Each part was pretty good,

20:20.295 --> 20:23.304
but together, Elton freakin' John.

20:25.116 --> 20:27.450
Sadly, sometimes it goes the other way.

20:27.452 --> 20:29.469
The whole is less than
the sum of its parts.

20:29.471 --> 20:31.896
In sports, this has come to be known

20:31.898 --> 20:34.190
by the term "Cleveland Browns".

20:37.887 --> 20:40.146
Yeah, some combos just don't work.

20:40.148 --> 20:43.633
And in a political campaign,
the team has to add up

20:43.635 --> 20:45.755
to more than what
each individual brings.

20:45.757 --> 20:47.804
Because if all you can come up with

20:47.806 --> 20:51.324
is putting an exclamation
point after the word "Jeb",

20:51.326 --> 20:54.919
well, those parts will add
up to a crushing defeat...

20:54.921 --> 20:57.313
exclamation point. (CHUCKLES)

20:57.315 --> 20:59.649
But if you can make your candidate

20:59.651 --> 21:01.408
as likable, say, as...

21:01.410 --> 21:04.245
our protein peanut butter bars...

21:04.247 --> 21:06.322
(CHUCKLES) the result
is a delicious victory.

21:06.324 --> 21:08.174
One of these can sustain you

21:08.176 --> 21:10.518
during a long sit in a deer stand.

21:12.998 --> 21:15.607
But, damn, you got to
bring along some milk.

21:26.602 --> 21:28.244
(MUFFLED): Ba...

21:29.514 --> 21:31.206
Baxter out!

21:33.674 --> 21:35.330
