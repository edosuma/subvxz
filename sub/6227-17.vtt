WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.378
Previously on Grimm...

00:04.880 --> 00:05.881
You all right?

00:10.886 --> 00:12.103
That's not right.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.681
Today,
lam formally announcing

00:13.764 --> 00:15.732
my candidacy for
mayor of Portland.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.150
We need to know what he knows.

00:17.226 --> 00:18.986
You're thinking
about smoking that hat again?

00:22.898 --> 00:24.775
It's been a brutal day.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.361
I really need this.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.322
Um, If I win...

00:29.613 --> 00:31.115
When you win.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.500
I want to know
who's behind all of this.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.920
This has never
happened to me before.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.418
We're not gonna
kill anyone, are we?

01:24.501 --> 01:26.299
'Cause I'd like to
know that up front.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.923
Renard is cooperating
with Black Claw.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.388
Did he know that Dixon
was gonna be assassinated?

01:32.467 --> 01:34.185
Not at the time,
but he does now.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.854
How do you know that?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.476
Rachel told me.

01:38.432 --> 01:42.357
Rachel just flat out told you that
Renard is involved with Black Claw?

01:42.603 --> 01:44.480
Why would she do that?

01:46.398 --> 01:47.820
I slept with her.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.025
I'm serious.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.156
So am I.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.452
I was Sean Renard at the time,

01:51.528 --> 01:54.407
I didn't know how personal
their relationship was.

01:57.993 --> 02:01.714
So, Rachel was sleeping with the
captain and talking to you?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.045
Yes.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.710
That's a lot to unpack.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.793
Black Claw wants to take
control of the government,

02:08.836 --> 02:10.597
and they're starting
in Portland with Renard.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.885
Have you noticed any
changes in Adalind?

02:16.720 --> 02:18.063
What are you talking about?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.524
The suppressant you
gave her won't last.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.735
And if she becomes
a Hexenbiest again,

02:23.852 --> 02:25.820
she will not be
who you know now.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.659
Kind of been there, done that.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.237
Then you should be prepared.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.834
Did you give him the number
of where we're going to be?

02:47.918 --> 02:49.295
He's got our cells.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.255
He needs to know where we are.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.682
Then tell him.
I'll go start the car.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.519
Hello?

02:58.595 --> 03:00.017
Hi, Mrs. Johnson.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.440
Uh... It's Roger.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.401
Roger? Are you okay?

03:04.851 --> 03:08.651
Yeah, I'm good.
Is Brian there?

03:08.730 --> 03:10.698
He's not picking up
any of his phone calls.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.276
Just a second.

03:14.403 --> 03:16.371
Brian, Roger's on the phone!

03:16.446 --> 03:17.948
I'm not here.

03:21.076 --> 03:24.000
I'm sorry, Roger. I guess
he's just not in the mood.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.791
Yeah, okay.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.676
Uh... Thank you.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.310
You can at least call
your best friend back.

03:38.385 --> 03:41.184
He has been
trying to call you.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.641
He needs to talk to you.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.068
Maybe your dad and I
should stay home tonight.

03:47.144 --> 03:48.737
Come on,
Mom, I'm fine.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.322
It'd be good for
you to talk to Roger.

03:52.816 --> 03:55.160
Okay.
I'll call him, all right?

03:56.611 --> 03:58.079
As soon as you leave.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.543
Okay.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.257
Goodbye, Brian.

04:17.339 --> 04:19.512
Call us if you need anything.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.276
Brian, open up!

04:36.985 --> 04:39.329
I know you're in there, man!
Open up the door!

04:39.404 --> 04:40.621
I don't wanna talk!

04:40.697 --> 04:42.665
Come on, man! I've
been calling you all day!

04:42.741 --> 04:44.334
Yeah, so stop!

04:44.409 --> 04:45.535
Brian, come on, man!

04:45.702 --> 04:46.828
Goodbye.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.584
Brian!

05:39.756 --> 05:42.384
No, no, no, please, don't hurt me!
Don't hurt me!

05:43.635 --> 05:45.353
Please! No!

06:01.611 --> 06:04.455
Eve knows Renard
is working with Black Claw.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.374
How can she
know that for sure?

06:06.658 --> 06:08.251
Because Rachel,
the woman who's working

06:08.326 --> 06:10.545
for Dixon's campaign,
told her.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.588
Why admit any of this to Eve?

06:13.456 --> 06:14.673
She slept with her.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.126
Whoa, whoa.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.633
Eve slept with Rachel?

06:18.712 --> 06:21.181
Well, she wasn't Eve,
she was the captain.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.641
But Eve didn't
know that Rachel was

06:23.717 --> 06:25.970
already sleeping
with the captain.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.556
So, she really had no choice
but to go through with it

06:28.638 --> 06:31.357
by the time things
started getting personal.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.732
Well,
I wonder what that was like.

06:35.145 --> 06:38.240
I didn't ask.
But that isn't all.

06:38.315 --> 06:43.367
Eve warned me that Adalind is going
to become a Hexenbiest again.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.205
I don't know what I'm gonna do
when that happens.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.841
Well, you should
probably start thinking

06:47.908 --> 06:49.080
about how you're
gonna handle that.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.959
Do you have any idea
when that's gonna happen?

06:52.287 --> 06:54.585
She didn't say
anything to you?

06:57.292 --> 06:58.384
No. Why?

06:58.460 --> 07:00.929
Nick, she was
supposed to tell you.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.340
What?
What?

07:03.798 --> 07:06.142
I told her she
had to tell you.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.938
It was while you were in Germany,
she was there, Tony was there.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.310
If Adalind hadn't
have been there...

07:11.389 --> 07:13.517
Wait a minute.
Tony was in town?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.840
I didn't want to
say anything...

07:14.851 --> 07:16.569
I swear to God,
I will kill that guy.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.022
Because of that.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.614
He asked me for money and
when I said no, he got angry.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.493
He was gonna hurt me
and then Adalind came in.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.280
She told him she was
gonna call the cops,

07:27.364 --> 07:29.833
and then he went after her
and it just...

07:29.908 --> 07:31.751
It just happened.

07:34.829 --> 07:39.380
She broke every finger on
his hand without even touching him.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.753
And then he ran away.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.094
She didn't want it
to happen, but it did.

07:45.173 --> 07:47.016
She was scared of
what you'd do to her.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.888
I told her she had
to tell you, Nick.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.390
Well, she didn't.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.564
That's probably
not a great sign.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.114
I'm so sorry, Nick.
But she's afraid.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.993
You know, maybe it's best we let
her keep her secret for now.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.661
She's got to be
the one to tell you,

08:06.736 --> 08:09.080
otherwise there won't
be any trust at all.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.084
Just be careful, dude.
Seriously.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.473
Well, that more than makes
up for last time.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.387
Wait, what?

08:29.092 --> 08:30.765
Exactly. Never even happened.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.437
Time for you to start thinking
about settling down.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.894
When are you gonna pop
the question? Hmm.

08:40.602 --> 08:43.277
Voters need a married man
with a happy family.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.118
I don't have a family,
happy or otherwise.

08:48.403 --> 08:51.703
Don't worry. You will.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.190
Nick?

09:26.357 --> 09:27.404
Yeah?

09:28.651 --> 09:30.119
Are you okay?

09:30.445 --> 09:32.072
Just getting some water.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.629
Sorry. I was trying
not to wake you up.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.507
That's okay.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.009
I forgot to
tell you something.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.765
Yeah?

09:57.138 --> 10:00.142
I have an interview
at my old law firm tomorrow.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.771
Oh, Well,

10:04.813 --> 10:06.440
you ready to get back to work?

10:07.023 --> 10:09.025
Yeah, lam.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.327
As long as they'll let
me bring Kelly with me.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.154
You okay with that?

10:14.030 --> 10:16.624
Yeah. If that's what you want.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.210
I think it's time.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.352
No, no.

12:07.310 --> 12:10.735
You need to climb down into
the first part of the tunnel.

12:10.813 --> 12:15.159
There's an old steel door when
you get about 20 yards in.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.362
It took me
a long time to open it

12:17.445 --> 12:19.743
'cause I don't think it had
been opened in 50 years.

12:19.822 --> 12:20.869
What's on the other side?

12:20.949 --> 12:21.996
More tunnel.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.919
I know it goes down,
but that's all I know.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.587
I haven't been able
to go into it yet.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.841
I've checked city plans,
there's nothing.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.302
I think it was built
sometime during Prohibition.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.630
It might even hook up
with the Shanghai Tunnels.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.259
Does Adalind know about this?

12:36.339 --> 12:37.619
Yeah, she knows
there's a tunnel,

12:37.674 --> 12:40.052
but now that I know that
she's a Hexenbiest again,

12:40.426 --> 12:42.895
I don't want her knowing any
more than she already does.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.643
Probably a good idea.

12:44.722 --> 12:47.350
I'm thinking you should find
out where this tunnel goes,

12:47.433 --> 12:49.435
just in case, you know,

12:49.519 --> 12:51.487
what if someone else has
access you don't know about?

12:51.562 --> 12:55.283
I know, but it's hard to
explore with Adalind there.

12:55.358 --> 12:56.610
Right.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.571
But she's gonna be gone all
day at a job interview.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.654
She's going back to work?

13:00.697 --> 13:02.699
Yeah. Her old law
firm wants her back.

13:02.782 --> 13:03.874
You want me to take a look?

13:03.950 --> 13:05.668
You mean us?
Us.

13:05.743 --> 13:06.995
That's what I was thinking.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.678
You get enough sleep?
Not really.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.005
Why not?

13:17.714 --> 13:22.311
Rosalee told me that Adalind
is a Hexenbiest again.

13:22.385 --> 13:23.385
What?

13:23.428 --> 13:26.056
It happened when I was
in Germany with Monroe.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.439
Rosalee told Adalind to
tell me, but she did not.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.895
Well, now I know why you're
not getting enough sleep.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.069
And that's not all.

13:37.442 --> 13:41.492
Eve told me that the captain is
knowingly working with Black Claw.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.291
He knew Dixon
was gonna be shot?

13:45.408 --> 13:46.876
If he didn't then,

13:47.785 --> 13:48.911
he does now.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.129
How do we handle this?

13:51.039 --> 13:52.666
Like we don't
know what we know.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.967
Griffin.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.425
Yeah? Where?

13:59.505 --> 14:00.757
Be there in 15.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.932
We got a body?

14:02.050 --> 14:03.097
Not entirely.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.478
- Wu!
- Down here.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.522
You got a body yet?
Still looking.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.728
Fisherman called it in.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.309
He's right down over here,
found the head.

14:11.392 --> 14:14.271
Actually, to be more accurate,
his dog found the head.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.278
I'm sure the pooch thought he
found one hell of a chew toy.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.069
We're searching the area
all around where the dog was,

14:21.152 --> 14:22.432
but without
the rest of the body,

14:22.445 --> 14:24.368
gonna be a challenge
to establish identity.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.706
Male, young. Under 20.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.084
Hasn't been dead that long.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.373
Any vehicles in the area?

14:33.456 --> 14:34.456
No.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.843
Well,
somebody brought him here.

14:36.918 --> 14:38.465
Or just his head.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.841
What about a blood trail?

14:39.921 --> 14:43.425
No, not that we've found, and there
is no surveillance in this area.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.931
Let's start with
missing persons.

14:51.015 --> 14:54.440
Adalind. So glad you are here.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.238
Harrison, thank you for being
interested in having me back.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.408
Well, I won't lie. You were
always a favorite around here.

15:00.483 --> 15:04.533
It was quite a blow when you decided
to take that job in Austria.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.540
It was what I
needed to do at the time.

15:07.615 --> 15:10.835
Hmm. Well, this must be Kelly.

15:11.661 --> 15:17.293
Well, Kelly, we are so glad that your
mother decided to come back to work.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.544
But don't expect
to make partner

15:19.669 --> 15:22.172
until you're at least out
of kindergarten.

15:22.547 --> 15:26.393
Well, why don't you sit down? We'll
talk about when you two can start.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.686
I can start pretty much
any time you're ready.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.513
Oh, we're ready.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.359
It'll be nice to have
a Hexenbiest back in the firm.

15:34.851 --> 15:38.196
Assuming you are still
available in that capacity.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.242
Same as ever.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.167
According to the ME,

15:59.250 --> 16:02.379
our victim's head was severed
by a surgically sharp blade.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.305
So, we're probably talking
some kind of sword.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.472
Probably.

16:05.548 --> 16:08.222
Don't get too comfortable.
Got a possible ID on your vic.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.975
Brian Johnson, 18 years old.
Parents reported him missing.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.147
It is the only
report we got last night.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.475
Let's talk to the parents,
see if he's still missing.

16:15.558 --> 16:18.277
Yeah, let's keep
the details to ourselves.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.236
Why did you
report him missing?

16:22.315 --> 16:23.612
Did you think
something happened to him?

16:23.691 --> 16:27.286
No. Not at first. We got home late
last night and he wasn't here.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.826
We hoped he'd just gone out.

16:30.198 --> 16:33.122
I called all of his friends
and no one had heard from him.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.498
Did he have a cell?

16:34.577 --> 16:36.750
We tried calling,
but he left his phone here.

16:36.913 --> 16:39.291
When we didn't hear from him,
we reported it.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.167
When was the last
time you saw him?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.127
In the basement,
playing video games.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.674
Can you show us?

16:44.795 --> 16:46.092
Yeah, right this way.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.057
All right, where was he
when you talked to him?

16:56.140 --> 16:58.188
He was sitting on the couch.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.940
What did you talk about?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.238
His friend Roger
had called and...

17:02.730 --> 17:06.030
But Brian didn't want
to talk to him or anyone.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.617
Was there a problem?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.912
He had been
having a tough time.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.286
Brian and his friend Roger
had been found guilty

17:12.365 --> 17:15.289
of criminally negligent
homicide about three weeks ago.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.119
They both got five
years' probation.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.250
It was an accident.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.329
What happened?

17:19.579 --> 17:22.128
Last January,
they were all drinking.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.925
One of them had a gun.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.299
They were showing off,
it was loaded.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.093
And their friend,
Kuma, was shot.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.300
And he died.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.471
Brian couldn't handle it.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.552
We put him in therapy,

17:32.635 --> 17:35.514
but all he did was sit on the
couch and play his video games.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.065
He wouldn't talk to
us or his friends.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.189
We shouldn't have gone out last night.
We should have stayed home.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.404
Did he have
access to a vehicle?

17:43.479 --> 17:45.948
Yes.
But it's still in the garage.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.492
Tell us what
happened to our son.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.614
We believe your
son was murdered.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.995
What? on, my God.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.832
Oh, my God, Brian, baby.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.325
Now, were there any signs
of a break-in or a struggle?

18:03.374 --> 18:06.344
No, but we found his cell phone
on the floor over there.

18:17.305 --> 18:18.852
- Your son make this?
- No.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.184
I know who did this.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.149
What?
Jin Akagi.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.356
He never believed
the shooting was an accident.

18:27.815 --> 18:28.941
Who's Jin Akagi?

18:29.025 --> 18:31.699
Kuma's dad, the father
of the boy who died.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.905
That son of a bitch threatened
Brian and Roger

18:33.988 --> 18:35.285
in the courtroom.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.786
He said that they
deserved to die.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.334
Everyone heard it.

18:38.576 --> 18:39.828
Griffin.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.167
Yeah, where?

18:43.289 --> 18:44.415
In the same area?

18:45.708 --> 18:47.631
We'll be there
as soon as we can.

18:48.544 --> 18:49.796
Was that about our son?

18:50.296 --> 18:51.673
We don't know yet.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.633
We'll call you as soon
as we know something.

18:54.091 --> 18:55.263
So, what do we know?

18:55.343 --> 18:57.766
They found a body
and it doesn't have a head.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.399
Kind of dark.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.071
Kind Of?

19:12.943 --> 19:15.162
God,
I hope there aren't any rats.

19:28.626 --> 19:29.752
Well,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.673
this must be
the door Nick told us about.

19:35.466 --> 19:37.935
Looks like the locking mechanism
for a watertight door,

19:38.010 --> 19:40.138
like a bulkhead
on a submarine.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.190
So, maybe there's
water on the other side?

19:44.767 --> 19:46.314
Like what, the ocean?

19:53.109 --> 19:54.486
Maybe you shouldn't open it.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.288
But Nick told us he
already opened it.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.456
Well, maybe it was low tide.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.628
Maybe hold your breath,
just in case.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.527
That's kind of pungent.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.693
How far down do
you think this goes?

20:31.772 --> 20:33.524
One way
to find out.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.452
I'll go first.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.417
- Where is it?
- Over here by the river,

20:51.500 --> 20:53.252
buried up to the neck.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.679
That's why it took
us so long to find it.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.218
How'd you do with the parents?

20:57.339 --> 20:59.216
We're pretty
sure it's their son.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.264
Sorry.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.435
You feeling okay?

21:03.512 --> 21:05.514
Yeah,
it's just a little headache.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.819
But not as bad as Brian's,
so I'm not complaining.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.659
He was buried
standing up.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.624
Don't you generally bury
somebody lying down?

21:23.824 --> 21:25.246
Usually.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.623
Now, assuming this is Brian,

21:26.702 --> 21:29.330
then our killer must have
abducted him from home,

21:29.413 --> 21:30.505
brought him all
the way out here,

21:30.581 --> 21:34.461
buried him, beheaded him, and
thrown his head under a bridge.

21:35.211 --> 21:38.306
Somebody went through a lot of
trouble to dig a hole this deep.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.540
There must be some reason
why they buried him this way.

21:40.549 --> 21:43.268
Burkhardt.
Detective, it's Teri Johnson.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.221
He's gone.
What's wrong?

21:45.763 --> 21:48.141
Dennis is on his way
to Jin Akagi's house.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.851
He thinks that
Jin killed Brian.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.254
I'm afraid he's
going to hurt him.

21:51.268 --> 21:52.645
What's Akagi's address?

22:06.075 --> 22:07.827
Where's your husband?
What's wrong?

22:07.910 --> 22:09.253
Jin!

22:09.495 --> 22:10.917
What are you doing?
Jin!

22:10.996 --> 22:13.249
He's not here.
His car is in the driveway.

22:13.749 --> 22:17.879
Jin! I know you're here, you son
of a bitch! You killed my son!

22:17.962 --> 22:19.009
I'm calling the police!

22:19.129 --> 22:20.176
Jin!

22:26.929 --> 22:28.806
Johnson's already here.

22:32.476 --> 22:33.477
Police.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.862
He came into our house
and attacked my husband.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.986
He assaulted me.
All I did was defend myself.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.385
You must have hit
him pretty hard.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.244
He came in here screaming
about how I murdered his son.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.788
It was his son
that killed our son.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.241
Can you hear me?
Yeah.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.723
Dennis Johnson
needs to be locked up

22:47.783 --> 22:48.955
the way his son
should have been.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.752
His son was
murdered last night.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.835
Oh, my God, no.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.470
Something attacked me.
I don't know what it was.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.468
Can you walk?
Yeah.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.800
Yeah, just get me out of here.
All right.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.973
Can you tell me where
you were last night?

23:11.056 --> 23:12.603
We were assaulted
in our own home,

23:12.683 --> 23:14.606
and you're questioning us
as if we're murderers?

23:14.727 --> 23:16.650
Anything you tell me could help.
Here's what I'll tell you.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.231
I want him
arrested for assault,

23:18.314 --> 23:20.988
and we're not answering any questions
without our lawyer present.

23:21.150 --> 23:23.073
Then you're gonna
wanna talk to your lawyer.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.780
I don't know
what it was.

23:26.238 --> 23:30.835
I can't really describe it. It was
like some kind of animal or a mask.

23:31.619 --> 23:34.088
Just do your best to
describe what you saw.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.165
It happened pretty fast.

23:36.790 --> 23:40.920
It was kind of white and had
these really blue eyes.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.549
Look,

23:46.008 --> 23:50.058
my son just died. I'm obviously
not thinking straight.

23:50.512 --> 23:53.231
I know I shouldn't
have gone over there,

23:54.224 --> 23:55.851
but I just want my son back.

24:05.903 --> 24:08.622
Mr. Akagi's here with his attorney.
Where do you want him?

24:08.697 --> 24:10.370
Put him in Two.
Yeah.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.044
Mr. Akagi's here.

24:17.539 --> 24:20.759
I'm gonna hold you until we find
out if he wants to press charges.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.882
I just want to
get back to my wife.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.398
This is my lawyer,
Takeshi Himura.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.403
This is a very unfortunate set
of circumstances.

24:43.482 --> 24:47.988
Jin and Madoka were saddened
to learn of Brian's death,

24:48.737 --> 24:51.536
and are more than willing to
cooperate with your investigation.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.834
Are you going to press charges
against Mr. Johnson?

24:53.909 --> 24:57.004
They do not wish to add
to Mr. Johnson's suffering.

24:57.079 --> 25:00.174
However, if Mr. Johnson attempts
to contact my clients again,

25:00.249 --> 25:02.126
we'll be forced to
take legal action.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.256
Understood.

25:03.419 --> 25:05.342
We need to ask you
where you were last night.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.347
They were
at a fundraiser.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.262
Doernbecher
Children's Hospital.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.515
I have names if you
wish to corroborate.

25:14.972 --> 25:16.770
I believe 25 should be enough.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.360
That ought to do it.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.109
We're conducting
a murder investigation

25:22.187 --> 25:24.406
into the death
of Brian Johnson,

25:24.815 --> 25:26.192
and we'd like to
ask you some questions

25:26.316 --> 25:27.659
about the accident
that killed your son.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.112
It wasn't an accident.

25:29.194 --> 25:33.119
Jin's son, Kuma, went to his
friend Roger Voorhees' home.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.917
Roger and Brian
were both drinking.

25:35.993 --> 25:38.087
Roger brought out a gun
that was owned by his mother.

25:38.162 --> 25:40.039
Kuma was shot and killed.

25:40.122 --> 25:44.127
Roger and Brian were convicted of
criminally negligent homicide.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.086
All they got was probation.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.764
They killed my son and
they got away with it.

25:48.839 --> 25:51.137
Mr. Johnson told us you
threatened his son in court.

25:51.216 --> 25:54.220
I'm sure you can understand the
emotional state of Jin at that time.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.772
Just as you understand
Dennis Johnson's state today.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.018
We still need to follow up.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.733
Now, one of the boys you
threatened was murdered.

26:03.812 --> 26:07.157
Okay. This is crazy.
I didn't kill anyone.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.823
Losing our son
destroyed our life.

26:10.903 --> 26:13.702
You don't feel the same after that.
Nothing does.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.831
If you had any real evidence,
you would charge my client.

26:20.162 --> 26:21.334
This conversation is over.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.414
One more question.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.334
When Dennis Johnson
entered your home,

26:25.417 --> 26:27.715
was there anyone there
besides you or your wife?

26:29.296 --> 26:30.297
No.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.179
I don't follow this
line of questioning.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.970
We're just trying to establish
if there are any witnesses.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.101
No, there were none.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.182
Now, if you'll excuse us.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.656
With 25 people willing to vouch for
him, he's probably not our guy.

26:51.735 --> 26:52.952
No, probably not.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.531
But I believe he's
connected to this somehow.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.493
There's motive out there, we just
don't know who it belongs to.

26:58.575 --> 27:00.373
Let's talk to the other kid.

27:00.452 --> 27:03.752
He's the only one still alive who
was actually there when Kuma died.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.360
Here,
hand me the lantern.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.046
Wow.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.932
It's bigger than I thought.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.805
We must be under the city.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.387
Yeah. Nick was right.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.731
I think this is part
of the old Shanghai Tunnels.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.571
Where do you think
that goes?

27:29.898 --> 27:31.366
So,

27:32.484 --> 27:33.986
how far are we gonna go here?

27:34.069 --> 27:35.787
I guess we'll find out.

27:37.447 --> 27:38.494
Oh, my!

27:39.575 --> 27:41.327
I think this is far enough.

27:45.873 --> 27:47.841
What do you mean,
"Brian's dead"?

27:48.208 --> 27:50.256
I just talked to
him last night.

27:50.460 --> 27:51.928
How did he die?

27:52.004 --> 27:53.130
He was murdered.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.261
Oh, my God.

27:55.465 --> 27:57.012
Is my son in danger?

27:57.342 --> 27:58.685
We're not sure.

27:59.428 --> 28:02.398
We need to know what happened
to Kuma Akagi that night.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.141
It was an accident.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.147
That all came
out in the trial.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.815
We'd like to
hear it firsthand.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.866
There might be something that you
remember that could help us.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.193
- Do I need to get a lawyer again?
- No.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.368
Roger's not a suspect.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.787
It's okay.

28:19.698 --> 28:23.498
My mom was gone for the
weekend and Brian came over,

28:23.577 --> 28:26.797
and we were drinking
and smoking some weed.

28:27.789 --> 28:30.042
And what happened
when Kuma came over?

28:30.500 --> 28:31.877
Nothing, at first.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.304
Whoo!

28:34.630 --> 28:37.133
Oh! It's like you never
chugged a beer before, man.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.718
- I have.
- Hey, where you guys at?

28:38.800 --> 28:40.518
Once.
Still counts.

28:40.594 --> 28:41.971
Yo, it's Kuma. What's up, bro?

28:42.054 --> 28:43.306
You guys got to
check this out.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.689
What is that?

28:44.806 --> 28:47.605
Oh! That's awesome.
Chill. It's my dad's.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.146
But I thought we could
slice and dice some things.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.829
This is seriously
the coolest thing ever.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.694
I'm gonna be like Jackie Chan.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.408
Jackie Chan
doesn't need a weapon.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.452
He is the weapon.
You know what I mean.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.493
I've got something
way cooler than this.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.199
This way, hold on.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.703
I went upstairs and
I got my dad's gun.

29:05.786 --> 29:09.211
It was his grandfather's when
he was a policeman in Chicago.

29:09.498 --> 29:11.171
I kept it under my bed.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.920
After my husband died,
I don't know,

29:15.587 --> 29:17.009
never even used it.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.762
I'm here alone with my son.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.299
I should have got rid of that damn thing.
I don't...

29:22.386 --> 29:23.729
I don't know why I kept it.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.400
What happened
when you brought it back down?

29:28.517 --> 29:29.564
Yo.

29:30.352 --> 29:33.105
If my mom found out about
this, she'd kill me.

29:34.856 --> 29:37.905
My great-grandfather used it in a
shootout against Al Capone's mob.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.157
Seriously?

29:39.236 --> 29:40.488
That thing is so old.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.173
Do you think it still works?

29:44.741 --> 29:46.493
The bullet hit
Kuma and he died.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.838
That's it.

29:51.832 --> 29:54.176
The police report said
there were two shots fired.

29:54.376 --> 29:57.880
You don't pull a trigger after it goes
off the first time unless you mean to.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.934
I wanna tell them
what really happened.

30:03.010 --> 30:04.762
Don't. They won't believe you.

30:04.845 --> 30:07.894
Roger, if we're going to catch who
killed Brian, we need the truth.

30:12.769 --> 30:14.612
Brian grabbed
the gun from the case.

30:15.897 --> 30:16.898
Do you think it still...

30:18.817 --> 30:20.490
What's going on?
No.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.383
Kuma.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.642
And maybe it was because we
were so messed up, but I swear

30:48.638 --> 30:50.936
Kuma turned into some...
Some kind of animal.

30:51.141 --> 30:54.566
And I know it sounds crazy,
but I know what I saw.

30:54.644 --> 30:56.191
You didn't tell anybody that?
No.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.363
Just my mom.

30:57.647 --> 31:00.992
I couldn't let him say that in court.
Obviously, it was the drugs.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.536
It wasn't the drugs, Mom.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.908
Did Brian see it too?

31:05.030 --> 31:06.998
Yes. Yeah, we both saw it.

31:10.952 --> 31:13.546
If Kuma Akagi is a Wesen
and his dad is Wesen,

31:13.622 --> 31:15.124
you're gonna have
to go Grimm on him.

31:15.207 --> 31:16.675
Yeah, but if
the killer is Wesen,

31:16.792 --> 31:18.214
then why bury
Brian in the ground,

31:18.293 --> 31:20.716
cut off his head,
and leave a paper dog behind?

31:20.796 --> 31:24.050
I mean, why not just tear him to
pieces like every other Wesen does?

31:24.132 --> 31:25.850
I don't know,
maybe it's a ritual.

31:25.926 --> 31:27.599
All right, Akagi does
have a sword collection.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.304
I think we're gonna have
to talk to him off record.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.390
And let's put a unit
outside the Voorhees' house.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.190
Was I not clear?
We're not answering

31:40.273 --> 31:41.633
any questions
without our attorney.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.573
What's wrong? Nothing,
they were just leaving.

31:43.652 --> 31:45.825
Well, we'd like to talk
to you off the record.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.372
What is that supposed to mean?

31:47.447 --> 31:48.994
Well, we just
talked to Roger Voorhees

31:49.074 --> 31:51.122
about what really happened
the night your son was shot.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.453
Whatever he told you is a lie.

31:52.536 --> 31:54.334
He said he saw Kuma Woge.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.650
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah, you do.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.467
And this is where
it gets interesting.

32:00.585 --> 32:03.759
You're Wesen, I'm a Grimm, and
we have a lot to talk about.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.347
Oh, my God, he'll kill us.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.898
We're not here to hurt you
unless you give us an excuse.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.185
I did not kill that boy.
We had nothing to do with it.

32:17.561 --> 32:19.154
We need to know
about these swords.

32:19.396 --> 32:20.443
Why?

32:20.522 --> 32:23.116
'Cause someone buried Brian
underground and cut off his head.

32:23.191 --> 32:24.363
What?

32:25.819 --> 32:27.321
They cut off his head?

32:28.071 --> 32:29.368
It can't be.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.207
What can't be what?

32:31.741 --> 32:33.118
Inugami.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.418
Hope you can explain that.

32:35.537 --> 32:38.211
It's a ghost dog, a guardian.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.213
What kind of guardian?

32:40.542 --> 32:41.885
Like a samurai.

32:43.378 --> 32:46.427
So, you're saying that Brian
was killed by a ghost dog?

32:46.506 --> 32:48.179
No. Inugami are Wesen.

32:48.258 --> 32:50.306
They're bound in
servitude to a family,

32:50.385 --> 32:52.808
and they're only called upon
to protect or avenge.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.357
And when they kill, they
follow a very specific ritual.

32:55.432 --> 32:56.524
Which is?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.398
They bury their
victim up to the neck

32:58.518 --> 33:00.316
facing northeast
towards a river,

33:00.395 --> 33:02.147
and they cut off
their head with a katana

33:02.230 --> 33:04.107
and throw
the head under a bridge.

33:04.191 --> 33:05.283
Why would they do that?

33:07.402 --> 33:10.201
To leave the victim's
soul in eternal peril,

33:10.530 --> 33:12.578
never allowing it to
pass into the afterlife.

33:13.241 --> 33:17.291
So, if this Inugami ghost dog
is your guardian,

33:17.704 --> 33:18.956
then you must know who it is.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.666
No, we don't have one.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.251
The only way to
bind an Inugami

33:22.334 --> 33:24.507
to your family is to
save that Inugami's life.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.805
I've never saved anyone's life.
Neither have I.

33:27.214 --> 33:28.386
Well, somebody has.

33:30.759 --> 33:31.760
Oh!

33:35.889 --> 33:36.889
What?

33:36.932 --> 33:39.105
My... My father
saved the life of a...

33:39.226 --> 33:41.320
Of a friend of his
when they were both boys.

33:42.604 --> 33:43.651
Who was it?

33:45.106 --> 33:47.325
If you know anything,
you have to tell them.

33:49.402 --> 33:50.403
Takeshi.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.451
Your attorney?

33:52.572 --> 33:53.744
No, no, no. It can't be.

33:53.823 --> 33:56.372
It has to be. He was
my father's best friend,

33:56.451 --> 33:59.625
and when my father passed away,
he always looked after me.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.672
But I never
thought he was Inugami.

34:04.793 --> 34:08.138
He's trying to get you the justice
he couldn't get you in court.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.849
Call Takeshi. We need to
find out where he is.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.175
What do I tell him?

34:12.259 --> 34:14.887
Tell him you're
being harassed by cops.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.561
Would Takeshi kill Roger
to avenge your son?

34:20.641 --> 34:22.393
I don't know, maybe.

34:23.018 --> 34:24.646
This would be
about honor.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.534
He would feel it was his duty

34:29.609 --> 34:31.156
if he is the Inugami.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.492
He's not answering.

34:33.947 --> 34:35.665
We need to get
to Roger's house.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.291
Take me with you. I can help.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.543
It's his ghost dog.

34:42.621 --> 34:43.793
Will he listen to you?

34:45.333 --> 34:46.926
He's doing this for us.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.255
If I tell him to stop,
he should stop.

34:49.504 --> 34:52.178
If he doesn't,
he will be shot.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.952
What are you doing?

35:21.036 --> 35:22.083
It's Adalind.

35:22.162 --> 35:23.505
She's back?

35:23.747 --> 35:25.044
Apparently, yeah.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.250
Well, how are we
supposed to get out?

35:28.627 --> 35:30.846
I don't know.
I guess we'll have to wait.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.676
I'm coming down.

35:56.446 --> 35:58.699
Where's the officer?
He's not in the car.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.368
Takeshi's
already inside.

36:09.584 --> 36:10.585
He's alive.

36:10.710 --> 36:11.830
She's still breathing.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.050
Call this in.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.012
Where would Takeshi go?

36:20.095 --> 36:22.348
He's gotta perform the
sacrifice near a bridge.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.182
Call him,
maybe we can track his phone.

36:28.645 --> 36:30.325
He's not answering.
We can still track him.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.357
We'll just have to start with the
bridge he's already been to.

36:32.440 --> 36:35.614
I need paramedics. Two injured,
517 North West Hamilton.

36:44.494 --> 36:45.541
Wu.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.060
Hey, we got a hit on Takeshi's
cell at the Sandy River Bridge.

36:48.081 --> 36:50.334
He's going back to
where he killed Brian.

36:50.417 --> 36:53.591
Block up the highway both directions.
We're on our way.

36:53.878 --> 36:58.133
I'm not spending the night down here.
And I have to pee.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.479
Maybe she's leaving.

37:04.097 --> 37:05.098
Go find out.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.255
Are you here to kill me?

37:33.626 --> 37:35.469
Juliette might have. I'm not.

37:37.756 --> 37:38.848
Is it Nick?

37:40.759 --> 37:42.352
Can you get his attention?

37:42.427 --> 37:43.428
It's Eve.

37:43.511 --> 37:45.479
- What?
- What do you want?

37:45.555 --> 37:47.182
We haven't had a chance
to talk face to face,

37:47.307 --> 37:48.854
and I thought now
would be a good time.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.273
I'm not sure we have
a lot to talk about.

37:51.352 --> 37:53.525
We don't, but things
are happening very fast

37:53.646 --> 37:55.819
and there is
something you do need to know.

37:55.899 --> 37:57.651
You will be
approached by Black Claw.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.953
They will try to draw you in.

38:00.695 --> 38:01.992
Why do they want me?

38:02.071 --> 38:03.539
Hexenbiests are valuable.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.575
I'm not a Hexenbiest anymore.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.207
You're lying.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.580
I don't blame you,
you're scared.

38:10.663 --> 38:13.007
You should be. With a
child, you're vulnerable.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.462
But if you hurt Nick,

38:19.005 --> 38:20.598
I will come for you.

38:26.179 --> 38:27.726
I like the new place.

38:46.074 --> 38:49.203
That's his car. He'll be
somewhere down by the river.

38:52.539 --> 38:53.540
Split up.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.355
No, please.

39:10.431 --> 39:11.978
Please. Please.

39:14.102 --> 39:15.604
Takeshi, no!

39:22.944 --> 39:24.446
Don't do this.

39:26.823 --> 39:29.747
Please, don't do this.

39:29.993 --> 39:35.090
I am bound by tradition and
honor to avenge your family.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.964
They're just boys.

39:43.631 --> 39:47.852
I release you from whatever
tradition you think you must do.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.724
You may be weak,

39:53.558 --> 39:54.650
but I am not!

39:57.520 --> 39:58.521
No!
No!

40:06.988 --> 40:08.285
By honor,

40:09.324 --> 40:12.168
I cannot harm
you or your family.

40:20.543 --> 40:22.261
But you will not stop me!

40:25.423 --> 40:26.766
No!

40:31.763 --> 40:33.185
You.

40:55.536 --> 40:56.958
We also have a tradition.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.008
You have the right
to remain silent.

41:05.254 --> 41:08.758
I didn't kill Kuma.
I swear, it was an accident.

41:13.388 --> 41:14.560
I know.

41:32.615 --> 41:33.741
Sean.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.708
I was going to call,

41:39.080 --> 41:40.878
but I thought
the surprise would be better.

41:41.290 --> 41:42.712
And what surprise is that?

41:52.010 --> 41:53.227
Daddy.

41:54.262 --> 41:55.479
Diana?

42:08.276 --> 42:09.778
You're such a big girl now.
