00:14.347 --> 00:16.099
What would Frank do?

00:17.809 --> 00:20.145
Given that she's carrying his child.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.918
I've always promised
to tell you the truth.

02:07.377 --> 02:11.214
Transparency is the cornerstone
of my presidency.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.592
And in that spirit, I feel compelled

02:14.676 --> 02:16.177
to share the following.

02:18.346 --> 02:19.931
For some weeks now,

02:20.014 --> 02:22.809
the Justice Department has been
investigating allegations

02:22.892 --> 02:25.728
that the former president, my husband,

02:26.146 --> 02:31.234
falsely inflated 2016 election day dangers
in several states

02:31.693 --> 02:34.445
that may have played a role
in tipping the results.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.074
This news, as you can imagine,

02:38.158 --> 02:41.244
has caused a widow's dark night
of the soul.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.767
Madam President!

02:48.334 --> 02:50.128
This used to be my office.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.466
That was my desk.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.847
The couch is different, but I slept here
more nights than I care to remember.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.059
Congressman Underwood's desk
was right through there.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.146
He never slept.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.578
Never button the bottom.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.085
- Madam President!
- Sarah, yes.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.045
Ma'am, to follow up.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.088
What specific action, if any,

03:34.172 --> 03:36.216
are you planning to take,
since your husband is...

03:37.300 --> 03:38.300
Dead.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.970
Well, everything is on the table.

03:41.429 --> 03:44.098
Up to and including
a posthumous indictment.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.727
- Larry.
- But, Madam President,

03:47.810 --> 03:49.890
if you're calling the election results
into question,

03:50.188 --> 03:51.856
what does that mean for your presidency?

03:51.940 --> 03:53.691
This is the highest office in the land.

03:54.317 --> 03:58.738
Public service is a sacred privilege,
and no one is above the law.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.033
Not the father of my child, not me.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.409
Marcus.

04:04.285 --> 04:07.372
Were you given any warning
about this article that just came out?

04:07.455 --> 04:09.123
By Janine Skorsky?

04:09.666 --> 04:12.961
- I don't know what you're referring to.
- It was posted as you were speaking.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.545
The headline reads,

04:14.629 --> 04:18.632
"Former President Underwood
excluded his wife from his will."

04:19.216 --> 04:20.635
Would you care to comment?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.013
Well, I can't comment
on what I haven't seen. Thank you.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.850
The source named in the piece
is Douglas Stamper.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.815
I have known Douglas

04:33.898 --> 04:37.860
since he became my husband's
right hand man over 20 years ago.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.612
And it is no secret

04:39.696 --> 04:42.907
that he's been having
a difficult time lately.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.618
Emotionally, above all else.

04:50.164 --> 04:54.085
And when I pardoned him months ago,
it was based on compassion.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.879
I feel for the man, I do.

04:57.547 --> 05:01.592
But Doug Stamper will never be the one
to lead us to the truth.

05:02.051 --> 05:05.346
"The former president
apparently handwrote an 11th hour will,

05:05.430 --> 05:08.850
technically known as a holographic will,
with instructions that his estate

05:08.933 --> 05:11.602
be left to his former Chief of Staff
Douglas Stamper."

05:12.645 --> 05:14.439
Does it say anything about what's in it?

05:14.522 --> 05:16.441
"The specifics of the will
are not yet public,

05:16.524 --> 05:18.860
but in an exclusive interview
with Mr. Stamper,

05:18.943 --> 05:21.571
he promised
to reveal the contents 'soon.'"

05:21.654 --> 05:22.905
That'll be all for now.

05:23.197 --> 05:24.240
Get White House counsel.

05:25.116 --> 05:28.161
No, no, actually get my personal lawyer
on the phone now.

05:28.244 --> 05:31.748
Yes, ma'am. And Assistant Director Green
is here, but he insisted that his...

05:33.166 --> 05:34.166
Madam President.

05:34.542 --> 05:38.588
Let me introduce you to my wife Abby
and this is our son Jackson.

05:38.671 --> 05:39.671
Hello.

05:39.839 --> 05:42.800
Abby's such a fan,
we were hoping to take a picture.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.551
Of course.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.555
I wanted my family here with me
when I let you know,

05:48.348 --> 05:49.432
I'm leaving the Bureau.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.644
I already submitted my letter
of resignation.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.149
Nathan, we can't possibly accept that.

05:58.232 --> 06:01.736
Please, President Hale. I'm begging you.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.650
Lynn, can you come in here, please?

06:11.204 --> 06:14.374
Nathan, I insist
we speak about this one-on-one.

06:15.958 --> 06:17.251
Can you give us a moment?

06:26.177 --> 06:28.721
I'm sorry I failed you
as far as the desert,

06:28.805 --> 06:30.306
but I can't do this anymore.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.016
- Nathan...
- I've made up my mind.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.770
It's better for both of us
if I go quietly.

06:37.939 --> 06:41.901
I'm sure you're looking forward to walking
Jackson to his first day of school.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.403
I am, ma'am.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.488
Well, my feelings haven't changed.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.700
I want Doug to finally,
finally get the help

06:49.784 --> 06:51.494
he so desperately needs.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.538
You're right to be concerned.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.041
There are some crazy people out there.

06:58.334 --> 07:02.713
In my last conversation with Doug,
he told me entities had approached him,

07:03.423 --> 07:05.883
hoping to recruit him. Abby.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.472
You should cancel your upcoming
public appearances.

07:20.898 --> 07:23.377
- Here to see an old friend.
- The president said,"Doug Stamper

07:23.401 --> 07:26.081
will never be the one to lead us
to the truth." You care to comment?

07:27.321 --> 07:30.575
It must serve the president to paint me
as some sort of crazy man.

07:31.075 --> 07:36.115
Bu I'm sorry to disappoint her, I am of right mind, and she knows it.
In terms of a revised will, who knows about its contents?

07:37.123 --> 07:40.418
- Why don't you ask her that question?
- Sir, how did you become aware of it?

07:43.546 --> 07:45.506
I was with him the night he died.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.299
He asked me to his suite at the Hay-Adams.
He told me he no longer had faith

07:49.343 --> 07:51.429
in his wife's ability
to serve as president.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.264
And President Underwood,

07:53.347 --> 07:57.226
the <i>real</i> President Underwood,
kept an audio diary.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.480
Pieces of which I've heard.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.063
Then let's find a court
that will rule in our favor.

08:04.108 --> 08:07.278
<i>...Stamper, former Chief
of Staff to President Francis Underwood,</i>

08:07.361 --> 08:08.988
<i>recorded earlier today.</i>

08:09.071 --> 08:11.991
<i>Let's turn to our panel for their take
on the claim that the leak...</i>

08:12.074 --> 08:14.202
<i>...remember, this is a troubled man.</i>

08:14.285 --> 08:16.913
<i>We can't take everything he says
at face value, right?</i>

08:16.996 --> 08:19.540
<i>The question is,
what is Stamper's endgame here?</i>

08:19.624 --> 08:22.084
- <i>Why the whole attack on President Hale...</i>
- What?

08:22.168 --> 08:25.046
- He was supposed to provoke her.
- <i>He walked away from murder charges.</i>

08:25.129 --> 08:26.369
<i>- Don't forget that...</i>
- Mark...

08:26.839 --> 08:29.509
- I don't have time to read your mind.
- I tried to warn you.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.345
I've worked with this guy.
We could be exposed.

08:32.428 --> 08:35.056
- Do you trust me, my instincts...
- Yes, of course I do.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.602
That has nothing to do
with evaluating the risk he is becoming.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.355
He's unhinged, Annette.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.440
Unhinged is what's called for.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.734
Contain him. That's your job.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.654
Hey.

08:52.907 --> 08:53.908
Annette!

09:00.790 --> 09:01.958
What's going on?

09:03.626 --> 09:06.837
If my son were anyone else
in this country, he'd be out by now.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.173
No, what's going on here?

09:09.840 --> 09:10.883
Between us?

09:12.009 --> 09:13.928
We're having sex again.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.223
Until it seems like a bad idea, again.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.849
- Hey, listen to me...
- That bitch

09:18.933 --> 09:20.733
is tipping the scales
when it comes to Duncan.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.062
And there's no way
he can get a fair hearing,

09:23.145 --> 09:24.564
until she's gone.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.441
Okay, hold on. Just, um...

09:27.525 --> 09:29.860
Can you back up a few words?

09:31.445 --> 09:32.530
How far back?

09:32.613 --> 09:35.199
Uh, "Moments like this require..."

09:36.033 --> 09:37.201
What is it?

09:37.285 --> 09:40.413
"Someone who will act.
Who will do the unpleasant thing."

09:40.705 --> 09:42.832
You know what?
Can you just let me hear it?

09:42.915 --> 09:43.915
No.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.002
Why not?

09:47.378 --> 09:50.047
I can't. It's...

09:54.844 --> 09:56.178
What are you doing?

09:59.974 --> 10:02.685
Nothing, I... Nothing.

10:09.525 --> 10:12.403
Look, we don't have
to go ahead with this. Okay?

10:13.613 --> 10:16.991
And whatever you need
to figure out, you should.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.703
Like, can't you just leave him alone?

10:20.786 --> 10:23.998
- What do you think I am?
- Look, I know exactly what you are.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.843
She's gonna come after you.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.141
"Requires someone who will act.

10:42.224 --> 10:45.186
Who will do the unpleasant thing,
the necessary thing.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.400
Don't be fooled by her beautiful face.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.861
My wife is ruthless."

10:53.944 --> 10:57.990
"The most ruthless woman
I've ever met. If people only knew."

10:58.991 --> 11:00.493
We've filed an injunction.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.546
But Skorsky's saying her source believes
the material belongs to him.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.455
This is insane.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.916
Unless someone produces evidence
of a will, there's no...

11:06.999 --> 11:08.876
Why are we even taking this seriously?

11:08.959 --> 11:11.379
I am confident I can silence her
with a gag order.

11:11.462 --> 11:12.880
But once a thing is in print,

11:12.963 --> 11:17.051
- any other news outlet has the right to...
- Print? This isn't print, Geraldine.

11:17.843 --> 11:21.472
- Can't we just shut down the site?
- No, ma'am. I don't think we can.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.308
My advice, let's depose.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.356
Get Mr. Stamper under oath.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.876
- If he perjures himself...
- No. That's exactly what he wants.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.694
He wants a public forum.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.407
And he's been through enough already.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.410
Madam President, I have to ask.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.995
And I will ask you this
in front of your attorney.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.164
Is it your position

11:47.248 --> 11:49.226
that you were entirely unaware
of your husband's...

11:49.250 --> 11:51.752
- You don't have to answer that.
- No, no, I want to.

11:52.837 --> 11:56.799
I don't know
if he did it for his sake or mine,

11:57.633 --> 11:59.719
but he never told me a thing.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.847
Ma'am, in <i>United States v. Nixon...</i>

12:02.930 --> 12:05.641
I swear on his unborn child.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.981
Well, there's no doubt
that there's areas of the company

12:12.064 --> 12:14.567
she's not quite as well versed in.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.360
Partly my fault, our...

12:16.736 --> 12:19.363
Our father didn't believe in succession.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.032
Are you saying you don't think
your sister deserves...

12:22.116 --> 12:24.618
No. That's not what I'm saying.

12:24.702 --> 12:28.581
If anything, when I talk about succession,
I'm talking about this presidency.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.751
Let's face it, our Commander In Chief,

12:31.834 --> 12:35.337
who basically inherited the job
from her husband,

12:35.421 --> 12:37.339
is acting like a goddamn monarch.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.258
When...

12:39.508 --> 12:43.471
When a tyrant pretends to be transparent,

12:43.554 --> 12:45.055
nation beware.

12:45.639 --> 12:46.932
And these...

12:47.224 --> 12:48.225
These comments,

12:48.309 --> 12:52.688
these public comments from Doug Stamper
make nothing but sense.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.024
I mean, follow the complicity.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.319
So, do you have any advice
for President Hale? Yes. Abdicate.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.408
- Oh. Come on now, Bill.
- No, no. Listen

13:04.492 --> 13:07.119
it wouldn't be the worst thing
for this country

13:07.203 --> 13:09.872
if she didn't finish out her term.

13:09.955 --> 13:10.998
Wow.

13:11.081 --> 13:15.002
If that's what was fated for her.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.754
- Mr. Shepard...
- Listen,

13:16.837 --> 13:19.089
I was flipping around the channels
last night,

13:19.173 --> 13:20.883
and I came across <i>The Alamo.</i>

13:20.966 --> 13:22.885
<i>I know it's not a great movie,</i>

13:22.968 --> 13:26.806
<i>but when John Wayne
chokes up saying "Republic...</i>

13:30.810 --> 13:35.064
Bill Shepherd, shut the fuck up.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.989
Reach out to the others.

13:44.073 --> 13:48.369
Remind them of the perils
of loose lips.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.711
Nathan Green was in a meeting
hosted by Annette Shepherd.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.674
I don't get rattled easily,

14:02.341 --> 14:06.053
but the secrecy around this one,
who was there and why,

14:06.136 --> 14:08.055
is more than I have ever come across.

14:08.931 --> 14:12.309
I suspect there were some
very powerful people in that room.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.144
Douglas Stamper?

14:14.812 --> 14:16.272
I don't know yet.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.108
Anything else?

14:23.112 --> 14:27.157
Walter, you have worked with us
from the beginning.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.913
Yes. I liked Frank.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.082
So, I'm curious.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.878
How did you pull it off?

14:40.045 --> 14:41.422
Oh, Claire,

14:42.047 --> 14:45.134
my calling is a practical one.

14:45.509 --> 14:50.097
I don't judge. I don't question.
I simply work for the highest bidder.

14:50.514 --> 14:54.727
I'm agnostic,
but this virtual landscape is new to me.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.353
And someone out there

14:56.437 --> 14:59.607
is working very hard
to make Frank look very bad.

14:59.690 --> 15:03.152
Listen,
it's just a lot of noise at the moment.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.946
It's not only about him.

15:08.824 --> 15:13.037
How will you manage to separate yourself
from all this shit?

15:14.830 --> 15:16.832
All that's left is Doug to connect me.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.256
Be careful, Claire.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.303
Oh, you guys.

15:29.386 --> 15:32.014
I really didn't wanna
have to have to do this, but...

15:34.016 --> 15:37.269
An extreme faction
of the ICO terrorist group

15:37.353 --> 15:41.273
made an attempt to purchase
a nuclear device in Pakistan.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.816
That's a fact.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.153
- Madam President, all due respect...
- Maria, I know you're new to this,

15:46.236 --> 15:50.116
but please don't ever use that expression with me.
"All due respect" means precisely the opposite.

15:51.742 --> 15:56.455
Ma'am, it's just that this threat remains
squarely in the category of a potential...

15:56.538 --> 15:58.082
The intent is there.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.976
Until we have confirmation
that the deal has...

16:00.000 --> 16:03.921
Our intelligence has told us
that they will regroup and try again.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.633
This goes back to the warning
from Rafiq Nasser two months ago.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.635
Now acting Secretary Gallagher and I

16:09.718 --> 16:13.138
have been keeping a close watch
on this threat ever since Nancy took over

16:13.222 --> 16:14.515
for Nora at Homeland.

16:14.974 --> 16:19.395
And in the spirit of the full transparency
this administration is embracing,

16:19.478 --> 16:20.729
we're going to take it public.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.984
Ma'am. Frankly, I'm concerned.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.277
From a strategic perspective,

16:27.361 --> 16:30.781
if ICO doesn't act,
we appear to be crying wolf.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.135
But on the other hand,
are we putting ourselves in a position

16:34.159 --> 16:36.120
where we're daring them to act?

16:37.663 --> 16:40.143
We don't want to appear reckless.
I couldn't sleep last night.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.384
For obvious national security reasons,
of course,

16:50.467 --> 16:51.467
but...

16:52.094 --> 16:54.304
also because the baby kept me awake.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.099
And for some reason...

16:58.392 --> 17:01.353
the word "misogynist" popped into my mind.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.856
And I was trying to think
of the word for the opposite.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.818
You know, the word for
when a person hates men.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.319
Does anyone around this table
know that word is?

17:11.070 --> 17:13.156
The word for when a person hates men?

17:13.656 --> 17:14.700
Anybody?

17:17.703 --> 17:19.496
I had to go and look it up.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.330
"Misandrist."

17:22.624 --> 17:26.753
And no one really knows that word
because it's not used in our culture.

17:27.212 --> 17:31.633
So what I'm getting at, is maybe we all,
regardless of our gender,

17:32.342 --> 17:36.180
would do well to examine
the pre-conceived notions that we have

17:36.263 --> 17:41.018
about who can and cannot act
as Commander In Chief.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.562
There you go.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.067
They're from a place
called the Federalist Pig.

17:48.650 --> 17:49.651
I don't know it.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.362
Well, I've been told it is
the next best thing to Freddy's.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.865
I'm good. You want some?

17:55.282 --> 17:56.533
No, they're for you.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.789
Doyle has been asking around about you.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.459
Now we can shut him down.

18:06.877 --> 18:07.877
But...

18:10.047 --> 18:12.800
Yeah, come on, give me one.
I mean...

18:12.883 --> 18:14.843
What kind of man says no to ribs, right?

18:22.017 --> 18:25.104
The articles and the press conferences.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.856
A little goes a long way, Doug.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.783
A lot of people,

18:38.867 --> 18:41.954
in a way, the whole country,

18:43.831 --> 18:44.911
we're relying on you. Seth,

18:47.501 --> 18:48.794
I can take care of myself.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.550
Can you pass that sauce?

19:43.640 --> 19:45.350
You must be so alone.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.314
Do you even have anyone around anymore
that you can trust?

19:50.397 --> 19:51.815
What are you playing at?

19:51.899 --> 19:54.443
<i>"Surely, she saw it all. The killing.</i>

19:54.526 --> 19:56.737
The lying," says Frank at minute six.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.281
<i>Doug, you and me have to have
a come to Jesus.</i>

19:59.364 --> 20:02.784
Agreed. Stop publicly accusing him
or it's all gonna come down.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.621
All I'm trying to do
is seek the truth these days.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.749
<i>Minute 76...
"Before I ever made any big moves,</i>

20:08.832 --> 20:10.709
I always ran them by my wife."

20:10.792 --> 20:14.463
I like the sound of your voice, Doug.
It's so soothing.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.882
<i>I never really thought about it before,</i>

20:16.965 --> 20:20.552
<i>but in just this way,
you remind me of Francis.</i>

20:21.303 --> 20:25.140
<i>The one thing I really miss is his voice.</i>

20:25.224 --> 20:27.601
It was always my favorite thing about him.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.103
No matter what he would say,

20:30.896 --> 20:35.275
the sound of his voice made me feel
like everything was going to be all right.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.443
<i>It's not.</i>

20:40.447 --> 20:42.783
<i>Besides Annette, who else was there?</i>

20:45.327 --> 20:48.455
I'm the only one who can save you, Doug.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.791
<i>"And then he asked
if I had no faith in God.</i>

20:51.375 --> 20:52.709
I said, 'You have it wrong.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.711
It's God who has no faith in us.'"

20:54.795 --> 20:57.381
<i>Minute 14.
Would you like me to play it for you?</i>

20:57.923 --> 21:00.592
Drop the investigation and apologize
for what you're doing to him

21:00.676 --> 21:02.386
<i>or more of this is gonna come out.</i>

21:02.803 --> 21:05.639
<i>I'm gonna press play.
I want you to hear it.</i>

21:38.297 --> 21:42.301
My security team just informed me
that Russian soldiers are firing

21:42.384 --> 21:45.679
- at American Special Forces, Viktor.
- They invaded the coast,

21:45.762 --> 21:47.639
which violates agreements you and I made.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.976
<i>- Preventing a nuclear device from...</i>
- Did you orchestrate this, Claire?

21:51.768 --> 21:54.688
<i>For what?
To distract from your husband's diary?</i>

21:54.771 --> 21:56.857
<i>And don't act like that
would be beneath you.</i>

21:56.940 --> 22:00.694
I don't believe motherhood
automatically makes a woman a saint.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.113
- Rafiq Nasser...
<i>- Is dead.</i>

22:04.406 --> 22:06.616
<i>We hit him with a drone strike
an hour ago.</i>

22:10.620 --> 22:13.373
He was providing us
with necessary intelligence.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.375
That you provided him with first.

22:15.459 --> 22:16.960
<i>The threat is real.</i>

22:17.044 --> 22:19.504
I'll have my people, the GRU,
take it from here.

22:19.588 --> 22:20.630
No, you won't.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.341
Look, Claire, just...

22:23.592 --> 22:26.178
worry about having your baby now.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.683
I've always been entertained
by your arrogance.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.812
It's like watching some movie,
just out of date.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.443
<i>If a rogue element gets their hands
on a nuclear device, Viktor,</i>

22:41.526 --> 22:43.070
<i>I will strike first.</i>

22:49.034 --> 22:51.453
What time is it there now?

22:52.120 --> 22:53.914
Must be close to sunrise, huh?

22:57.042 --> 22:58.042
Just about.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.717
If you drop an atom bomb,

23:07.219 --> 23:09.388
<i>our world, your daughter's world...</i>

23:15.811 --> 23:18.814
That sun will never
look the same again, Claire.

23:23.318 --> 23:24.444
What time is it there?

23:28.323 --> 23:29.324
Uh...

23:32.828 --> 23:34.287
I'm about to have lunch.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.872
And what are you having?

23:36.832 --> 23:38.792
<i>Oh, a salad.</i>

23:38.875 --> 23:41.711
<i>Cucumbers and tomatoes, a bit of feta.</i>

23:41.795 --> 23:45.382
Some Spanish olive oil
and herbs from Tangiers.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.300
I don't eat bread anymore, you know.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.138
We never had a proper meal, you and I.

23:52.222 --> 23:53.098
Not really.

23:53.181 --> 23:56.393
<i>I'll have to oppose you now,
openly at the UN.</i>

23:56.935 --> 23:58.520
<i>And at every turn.</i>

24:00.939 --> 24:03.024
Privately, I...

24:09.573 --> 24:11.950
I will miss you.

24:19.082 --> 24:21.293
As I made clear to President Petrov,

24:21.376 --> 24:24.754
I will not have terrorists
waltzing out of the desert

24:24.838 --> 24:26.214
with an atomic bomb.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.968
It's time for me to treat you all
like the adults you are.

24:30.719 --> 24:31.719
The truth is...

24:32.929 --> 24:35.098
I'm not the only one who's in danger.

24:35.182 --> 24:38.226
No one's safe. Not really.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.979
Not ever.

24:41.563 --> 24:45.066
Does that mean a nuclear strike?
The first one since Nagasaki?

24:45.317 --> 24:48.153
If need be, yes.

24:50.363 --> 24:51.490
<i>Terry.</i>

24:51.573 --> 24:53.742
<i>You've become a vocal critic
of the president.</i>

24:53.825 --> 24:55.577
<i>Even before your arrest.</i>

24:55.660 --> 24:59.456
<i>Actually, the first time you went public
was to support legislation</i>

24:59.539 --> 25:00.707
<i>limiting her powers.</i>

25:00.790 --> 25:03.335
Which is now more urgent than ever.

25:03.418 --> 25:04.878
<i>And recently, as you await trial,</i>

25:04.961 --> 25:07.255
<i>you got into some more hot water
with your comments.</i>

25:07.339 --> 25:09.674
<i>Yes, I misspoke.</i>

25:09.966 --> 25:13.178
<i>But let's face it.
This president is fatal.</i>

25:13.261 --> 25:16.556
<i>I mean, she's out there
evoking end of days.</i>

25:17.182 --> 25:20.810
<i>And with her in office, that is exactly
where this country is headed.</i>

25:20.894 --> 25:22.312
<i>And what am I?</i>

25:22.395 --> 25:27.359
Some antiquated soul
because I still believe in family?

25:28.026 --> 25:31.363
Listen, if you want to do something
in this country about poverty,

25:31.446 --> 25:32.489
family.

25:32.864 --> 25:35.200
Crime, family.

25:35.784 --> 25:38.870
Education, family. It's family.

25:39.246 --> 25:42.832
My parents had dinner at six o'clock.
Every single night.

25:42.916 --> 25:46.586
They didn't care where you were,
what the hell you were doing.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.880
<i>Dinner was at six, goddamnit.</i>

25:49.297 --> 25:52.509
<i>And when's the last time
you and your sister had dinner?</i>

25:57.389 --> 26:00.308
That is a fair question.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.311
And it has been some time

26:03.395 --> 26:06.648
since we sat across from each other.

27:00.535 --> 27:01.661
How you doing, Bill?

27:04.080 --> 27:05.415
Depends on the day. And the dose.

27:14.549 --> 27:18.511
I brought you some pastries,
from Poupon, Georgetown.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.014
I know you have a soft spot for those.

27:21.848 --> 27:23.767
Well, I don't do sugar anymore.

27:24.434 --> 27:27.520
It's... fuel for the tumor.

27:28.688 --> 27:29.888
You can have one, if you want.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.524
No, I'm good.

27:34.944 --> 27:36.571
Twenty years ago,

27:37.238 --> 27:39.157
I probably would have sat down...

27:40.742 --> 27:42.786
and written out my memoirs,

27:44.204 --> 27:45.330
instead of...

27:46.748 --> 27:49.959
trying to just get it out there
any way I can.

27:54.631 --> 27:56.591
I thought she would have come out.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.889
I'm sorry. She sent me.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.520
Does she want me to stop?

28:10.438 --> 28:11.648
The opposite.

28:12.649 --> 28:15.193
She wants you to keep
hitting the president hard...

28:16.945 --> 28:20.407
so that she can come out against you.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.786
Is this gonna be a mess?

28:29.416 --> 28:30.458
Could be.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.130
When did it happen?

28:36.589 --> 28:38.925
That we were the ones catching up.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.722
Were we not paying attention?

28:45.181 --> 28:46.307
Not enough.

28:47.684 --> 28:50.145
Francis was a son of a bitch.

28:52.522 --> 28:55.608
But he was a talented son of a bitch.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.070
He saw her coming.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.449
He just couldn't stop himself.

29:03.491 --> 29:04.617
Or her.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.914
Where do you think we're gonna be
in ten years, Mark?

29:12.959 --> 29:16.719
Huh? Come on. I'm asking everybody. - For obvious reasons.
- You think about it more than I do.

29:20.884 --> 29:23.219
Fat, wasted and distracted.

29:24.137 --> 29:27.182
Might be a good night out,
but it's no way to live a life.

29:39.652 --> 29:42.322
Come on, ten years?

29:44.282 --> 29:45.282
I don't know.

29:46.826 --> 29:48.953
Things don't really change, Bill.

29:49.829 --> 29:50.830
They just...

29:52.165 --> 29:53.917
They just fade away, man.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.303
God, I'm angry.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.771
I heard your husband's voice.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.649
Douglas Stamper came to us.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.360
Offered up Francis' diaries,

30:21.194 --> 30:24.322
snippets of which Doug played for me.

30:26.616 --> 30:29.869
And to tell you the truth,
I considered using it against you.

30:29.953 --> 30:34.207
But I don't think it should ever
find its way into the public sphere.

30:35.166 --> 30:38.086
- Forgive my surprise.
- I'm not my brother.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.421
Bill's become bad for democracy.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.215
Like Francis was.

30:42.757 --> 30:45.176
The world loves a cat fight,

30:45.260 --> 30:48.721
but I say
let's deny them the satisfaction.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.890
It's not too late for us.

30:53.142 --> 30:57.689
You know, you're right.
Let's not give them what they want.

30:58.439 --> 30:59.691
Fuck them all.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.527
Oh. Sorry, Angel.

31:03.987 --> 31:06.865
They hear things, you know.
There have been studies.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.533
Is it amazing?

31:09.117 --> 31:10.159
It is.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.037
She's an active little thing.

31:14.539 --> 31:15.707
May I?

31:16.541 --> 31:17.584
Sure.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.134
Oh, she's kicking.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.309
We'll take care of Doug.

31:34.684 --> 31:37.604
I don't believe your support.

31:37.937 --> 31:39.731
You're a bad liar, Annie.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.358
And you tried to kill her.

31:42.442 --> 31:44.193
You have my son.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.695
How are you gonna do it?

31:46.654 --> 31:48.489
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.534
Tell me who the others are
and I will let Duncan go.

31:51.618 --> 31:54.996
- He's innocent, as am I.
- God, please.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.582
This so-called nuclear crisis.

31:57.665 --> 31:59.417
You're worse than Frank.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.088
Oh. She's kicking again.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.762
It's like she senses
we're nearing the end.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.519
The only question, Doug,

32:18.603 --> 32:21.814
is if you're their plan A,
what's their plan B?

32:22.273 --> 32:24.275
<i>If Francis were here, we'd know.</i>

32:24.525 --> 32:26.152
Yes. Well, if he was going to kill me,

32:26.235 --> 32:28.821
<i>- how would he do it?</i>
- He'd find an opportunity you provided.

32:28.905 --> 32:31.115
He was always
three steps ahead, wasn't he?

32:31.616 --> 32:33.016
<i>Francis Underwood...</i>

32:33.076 --> 32:34.243
<i>Maybe he still is.</i>

32:36.913 --> 32:38.790
<i>Have I been keeping him alive?</i>

32:43.127 --> 32:45.505
<i>Just how far am I willing to go?</i>

32:49.425 --> 32:51.135
I'm having second thoughts.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.722
Am I sure this is a good idea?

32:55.139 --> 32:56.265
Yes.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.726
What if I'm carrying
a demon seed or something?

32:59.185 --> 33:00.812
The odds are 50-50.

33:01.896 --> 33:04.357
So tired of talking about Francis.

33:04.941 --> 33:07.068
I miss my boyfriend Reed.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.823
- I do too, sometimes, but...
- Reed wanted too much.

33:13.032 --> 33:15.868
Francis gave me permission to hunger.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.704
Because he felt it himself.

33:18.079 --> 33:20.248
All the time. Insatiable.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.667
Everyone thinks I should feel sated.

33:22.750 --> 33:26.963
Then he said,
"No, Claire, be as hungry as me."

33:27.046 --> 33:28.256
And so I ate him?

33:29.882 --> 33:31.509
He ate himself.

33:33.052 --> 33:34.387
Doug Stamper?

33:36.222 --> 33:37.765
Am I going to eat him?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.897
- Herr God.
- Herr Lucifer.

33:44.981 --> 33:46.190
Beware.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.704
You know, I always thought...

34:00.163 --> 34:03.124
- maybe one day, you know, but...
- Put it back.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.376
What?

34:05.460 --> 34:07.628
The picture. It belongs on the fridge.

34:09.338 --> 34:11.382
Okay, sorry.

34:14.635 --> 34:18.264
You know,
if there is anything that I can do.

34:19.223 --> 34:22.351
- I mean, in case it doesn't go as planned.
- Can you please stop moving?

34:22.435 --> 34:24.187
I'm a little worked up, all right?

34:25.271 --> 34:28.608
Claire Hale Underwood lived
and then she died.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.110
- She's no different from anyone else.
- Yeah.

34:31.527 --> 34:35.697
Well, I'm not sure the world's
gonna see it the way you do.

34:39.159 --> 34:42.330
If this breaks right, you can be a hero.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.126
Don't spin me, Seth.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.217
How do they plan to do me in?

35:01.557 --> 35:02.558
Seth?

35:03.434 --> 35:04.977
Look.

35:06.270 --> 35:07.897
I'm gonna say this to you.

35:09.565 --> 35:10.608
Not because we're friends.

35:12.401 --> 35:15.404
But because of everything
that we've been through together.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.582
You're an asshole.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.840
You don't have to be a part of this,
if you don't want to.

35:34.298 --> 35:36.342
You saying that for me or for you?

35:38.719 --> 35:39.971
Maybe both.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.022
I don't know who it is...

35:53.651 --> 35:56.571
but they have someone
inside the White House.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.995
Military always hated her.

36:04.078 --> 36:05.872
Hmm? That's one thing.

36:14.088 --> 36:15.131
Fuck 'em all.

36:17.466 --> 36:20.386
What about the two of us? We just leave.

36:21.637 --> 36:22.972
Where do you wanna go?

36:23.347 --> 36:24.724
Hello.

36:26.058 --> 36:27.058
How does he look?

36:27.518 --> 36:30.479
He's fine.
He's sure that she'll invite him in.

36:30.855 --> 36:31.855
Put him on.

36:36.694 --> 36:37.694
<i>Doug.</i>

36:38.487 --> 36:39.322
Yeah.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.824
What extraordinary times these are.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.701
<i>I wish I could be there
to shake your hand.</i>

36:43.784 --> 36:45.786
Annette,
I want to make something very clear.

36:46.412 --> 36:47.788
I'm not doing this for you.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.584
We'll be sure to move him
from Gaffney to Arlington.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.502
And help fund the Library.

36:53.836 --> 36:57.798
And, Doug, given your recent struggles,

36:58.633 --> 37:01.302
nine or ten years from now,
you could be out.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.512
<i>And I want to thank you.</i>

37:04.263 --> 37:05.348
<i>Seth.</i>

37:07.600 --> 37:08.434
Yes.

37:08.517 --> 37:11.687
Everything is set from our side.
The quarterback is standing by.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.439
And Duncan?

37:15.566 --> 37:17.401
Is going to have to wait.

37:23.324 --> 37:24.700
What else did she say?

37:25.243 --> 37:26.327
Nothing.

37:27.119 --> 37:28.204
Just...

37:29.163 --> 37:30.581
everything's in place.

37:36.545 --> 37:37.588
Later.

37:40.383 --> 37:41.384
Seth.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.430
It's not going to go like you think.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.362
No.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.199
I never liked talking to you
in the first place.

38:09.787 --> 38:13.165
<i>From what I hear, you were right
to cancel your public appearances.</i>

38:13.249 --> 38:15.334
- You think so?
<i>- I do, ma'am.</i>

38:15.418 --> 38:18.462
<i>I think the White House is
the safest place for you to be right now.</i>

38:18.546 --> 38:21.716
Nathan, you're a liar.

38:22.717 --> 38:26.679
Do me a favor.
Kiss your sweet baby's forehead for me.

38:35.646 --> 38:39.483
Our intelligence confirms the hand off
is on the verge of taking place.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.570
<i>And our intelligence says that's not so.</i>

38:42.653 --> 38:45.614
We're talking about
a 20-mile radius of sand.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.325
Unreachable by conventional means.

38:47.408 --> 38:50.036
<i>I'll have my forces coordinate
with yours, okay?</i>

38:50.119 --> 38:53.205
I'm not asking
for your permission, Viktor.

38:53.664 --> 38:57.877
<i>Look, Claire. I can see how eager you are
to show your enemies</i>

38:57.960 --> 39:00.129
<i>just how powerful you are.</i>

39:00.546 --> 39:02.173
<i>But, please,</i>

39:03.382 --> 39:05.343
<i>please don't do this.</i>

39:08.637 --> 39:09.972
<i>I know you,</i>

39:10.598 --> 39:11.932
<i>the things you've done.</i>

39:13.476 --> 39:16.020
<i>Think how the world will judge you.</i>

39:16.103 --> 39:18.981
As if you have any credibility
with the world stage.

39:19.732 --> 39:20.983
Prepare a statement.

39:21.067 --> 39:23.069
Ma'am, I need to object.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.236
Pardon me?

39:24.945 --> 39:27.406
The public is aware we're prepared
to strike.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.116
We don't need to alarm them further.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.371
I will not be a part of this...
this fabrication.

39:33.746 --> 39:36.916
Alert the military aide. I want him ready
and waiting with the briefcase.

39:42.671 --> 39:45.549
A targeted strike
will destabilize the region

39:45.633 --> 39:47.259
for decades to come...

39:47.927 --> 39:51.639
and it will create a distrust that will
ripple through Europe and much of Asia.

39:51.722 --> 39:55.601
Markets will be rocked.
Yes, the consequences will be grave.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.022
But it has come to my attention...

40:01.941 --> 40:03.567
that there is a plot against me.

40:04.985 --> 40:08.447
Someone in my White House is planning
to betray me.

40:08.989 --> 40:10.741
And until I find out who that is,

40:10.825 --> 40:13.619
I will not reconsider my position here.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.585
Ma'am? Something arrived for you
from Doug Stamper.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.087
It was passed through security.

40:24.004 --> 40:25.004
Thank you.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.206
<i>Yes.</i>

41:40.289 --> 41:42.333
The men in uniform don't support you.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.512
I want the White House emptied out.

41:54.595 --> 41:57.097
Other than yourselves,
minimal and essential staff only.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.433
- All visitors need to be cleared by me.
- Yes, ma'am.

42:20.746 --> 42:23.749
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you standing me up?

42:24.792 --> 42:27.419
God bless you, man.

42:27.503 --> 42:29.713
But this is not what you promised me.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.257
And you can tell the president

42:31.340 --> 42:34.343
that she can send
an army of lawyers at me,

42:34.426 --> 42:36.679
but I won't be buried.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.639
I am not going to stop.

42:38.722 --> 42:41.100
And I don't know when it will be or how.

42:41.183 --> 42:44.562
But I am going to finish
this godforsaken story, okay?

42:57.533 --> 43:00.995
See, the Harry Brooker painting,
that's my very favorite.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.331
And then there's the Hogarth.

43:04.623 --> 43:07.376
That's 1700's, English.

43:08.210 --> 43:12.423
And from France, the Chardin, same period.

43:13.007 --> 43:14.466
<i>Maison des Cartes.</i>

43:15.968 --> 43:17.094
There's...

43:18.012 --> 43:20.180
one from the 1800s from Germany

43:20.264 --> 43:22.308
that's very interesting in here.

43:23.559 --> 43:24.852
There, see?

43:26.061 --> 43:28.147
They all have one thing in common.

43:30.149 --> 43:31.775
Children watching,

43:32.484 --> 43:34.987
waiting for the cards to fall.

43:43.412 --> 43:44.538
Seth Grayson.

43:50.711 --> 43:51.754
Annette.

43:55.507 --> 43:56.925
I won't be here for this.

43:58.010 --> 43:59.303
Where would you rather be?

43:59.386 --> 44:00.596
I don't know.

44:01.013 --> 44:02.389
1999.

44:03.641 --> 44:05.851
Tenants Advocacy Group,
south side of Chicago.

44:05.934 --> 44:07.454
But I can't be there, so I don't know.

44:12.816 --> 44:15.402
If you're leaving, leave.

44:46.600 --> 44:47.601
Ma'am.

44:51.522 --> 44:52.940
Thank you, Colonel Flora.

44:55.901 --> 44:57.528
What did they promise you?

44:59.488 --> 45:01.407
- Ma'am, I didn't...
- Quiet.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.420
What took you so long?

46:02.134 --> 46:03.844
May we have the room, please?

46:05.345 --> 46:07.545
- Are you sure, ma'am?
- Yes. It's all right. Thank you.

46:15.898 --> 46:16.898
Doug.

46:18.150 --> 46:19.568
Do we need a drink?

46:19.651 --> 46:20.694
You can't.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.157
Well, desperate times, right?

46:34.458 --> 46:36.084
Here's who wants you dead.

46:38.587 --> 46:40.297
Annette Shepherd had me waiting.

46:40.839 --> 46:42.132
I know who was there.

46:44.343 --> 46:45.343
Thank you.

46:48.430 --> 46:50.015
Whatever happens here...

46:51.225 --> 46:52.601
It's between us.

47:05.823 --> 47:08.992
Doug, I know you.
You've never really had anyone else.

47:10.202 --> 47:11.912
Rachel Posner, but...

47:12.538 --> 47:15.457
How long do you think
you're going to get away with that?

47:19.837 --> 47:20.837
I don't.

47:24.424 --> 47:26.009
What are you going to call her?

47:27.970 --> 47:29.721
I haven't decided yet.

47:30.597 --> 47:32.850
- What do you think?
- Frances Underwood.

47:33.433 --> 47:35.060
Frances with an "e."

47:35.435 --> 47:36.770
That belongs to her.

47:39.898 --> 47:42.276
She ever gonna get to hear his voice?
His words?

47:42.359 --> 47:43.359
No.

47:44.027 --> 47:45.362
And neither is anyone else.

47:45.445 --> 47:47.239
- Her father was a great man, Claire.
- Doug.

47:49.616 --> 47:53.078
How many times
did he even mention your name

47:53.161 --> 47:54.705
in those recordings?

47:57.749 --> 47:59.877
- He was protecting me.
- No.

48:00.544 --> 48:02.671
I'm so sorry you need to believe that.

48:09.845 --> 48:10.762
Do you want it?

48:10.846 --> 48:13.181
I'm the only one left
who knows you, Claire.

48:14.600 --> 48:17.453
You're using that child out there,
acting like the mother of this nation.

48:17.477 --> 48:19.677
I know the truth. Doug, I'm happy.

48:21.732 --> 48:24.026
Believe me. I'm good.

48:28.655 --> 48:31.158
I want you to know that I forgive you.

48:32.951 --> 48:34.369
It was you, right?

48:47.716 --> 48:49.343
He was coming here to kill you.

48:51.053 --> 48:53.180
And then he was going to go to you next.

48:53.263 --> 48:55.182
I couldn't let you destroy him.

48:57.434 --> 49:01.021
Did you want him to die in my bed?
Was that your plan?

49:01.396 --> 49:03.106
I didn't have a plan.

49:05.525 --> 49:07.110
I didn't know.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.863
I didn't... I didn't know.

49:15.786 --> 49:17.329
I used his meds.

49:21.458 --> 49:23.877
I didn't know how long
it would take, but I...

49:25.170 --> 49:26.296
I knew.

49:29.383 --> 49:31.843
I couldn't let him destroy
everything we built.

49:34.012 --> 49:37.057
I had to protect the legacy from the man.

49:37.140 --> 49:38.850
He got weak, Doug.

49:39.267 --> 49:40.519
That wasn't your fault.

49:40.602 --> 49:42.312
He made you!

49:43.939 --> 49:45.732
Say it. Say it.

49:48.443 --> 49:49.653
Say it.

49:50.445 --> 49:52.322
I'm not going to give you what you want.

49:59.454 --> 50:02.916
Damn it, Claire. Just say it. Please.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.419
You're happy he's dead, too.

50:08.130 --> 50:10.215
Then say it! Say it!

50:10.298 --> 50:11.466
Say it!

50:11.550 --> 50:12.926
Say it right now.

50:13.677 --> 50:15.178
Let him go, Doug.

50:15.804 --> 50:17.389
I can't!

50:22.936 --> 50:24.187
I'm sorry.

50:25.897 --> 50:27.357
I'm sor...

50:29.317 --> 50:30.444
It's okay.

50:32.779 --> 50:35.407
It's okay. It's okay.

50:38.452 --> 50:39.703
It's okay.

50:40.078 --> 50:41.621
I'm sorry.

51:16.531 --> 51:18.075
It's all right, Doug.

51:19.284 --> 51:21.536
Everything is gonna be all right.
