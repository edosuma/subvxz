01:58.368 --> 02:00.078
Could Logan just get five?

02:03.998 --> 02:06.000
Welcome. How's your dad?

02:06.084 --> 02:07.168
Oh, pretty good.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.379
He hopes to make it
in person to the next one.

02:09.462 --> 02:11.548
- Oh, sure. Send him my best.
- I will.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.884
But still, you're here,
and that's nice.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.804
Thanks. I feel the same way.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.348
Great. We're all over
the fucking moon. What is this?

02:20.431 --> 02:25.520
Yeah, so, we are in discussions
to acquire GoJo.

02:25.603 --> 02:28.022
Oh!
- Okay.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.525
- How advanced?
- Oh, not that advanced.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.027
Just getting to outline terms.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.571
So pretty fucking advanced!

02:34.654 --> 02:37.699
Well, we didn't wanna bother you
until we have some protein.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.993
But we didn't wanna ambush you
in the boardroom.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.494
We wanted to
let you know in here.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.954
But you are still ambushing us.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.497
No, no, no.
We are not ambushing.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.541
Well, no, I mean,

02:46.624 --> 02:48.334
if you jump out
on someone on the road

02:48.418 --> 02:50.795
in the middle of the night,
hit them on the head and shout,

02:50.879 --> 02:53.423
"I'm not ambushing you,"
it's still a fucking ambush.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.466
I love my business.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.428
But we've had our throats slit
on ads for 20 years.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.096
We're bleeding out.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.973
Another five of cord-cutting

03:02.056 --> 03:05.602
and we'll be dead
on the fucking carpet.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.438
This is a transformative deal.

03:08.521 --> 03:12.317
Yeah, but, uh, just obviously...
this is not okay.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.652
We were supposed to be
inside deal-making.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.654
Well, you know,
we're moving very fast,

03:16.738 --> 03:17.822
and it's all very sensitive,

03:17.906 --> 03:18.990
- but I assure--
- I think they're assembling.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.074
Right. Shall we?

03:20.158 --> 03:23.202
Okay. How-- How will you feel if
Matsson starts

03:23.286 --> 03:25.747
micro-dosing and tweeting
about angels again?

03:25.830 --> 03:28.291
Matsson's a visionary.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.126
Sure?
'Cause he's trippin' balls.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.086
No, and he has a team
we can do business with.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.839
This is bigger than anything
you've ever contemplated.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.800
It will reshape
the company entirely.

03:37.884 --> 03:43.431
Well, if you guys really,
really don't like it...

03:43.514 --> 03:46.184
Sure. Kill it.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.062
Well, we didn't say that.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.941
So, shall we? Finally!

03:53.024 --> 03:55.276
Wh-- Where is Shiv on this?
Why isn't Shiv here?

03:55.360 --> 03:58.404
Oh, because this is
just inner circle.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.614
That's a joke, I'm kidding.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.616
I think the president will be
joining us, so...

04:10.875 --> 04:12.835
- Yeah?
<i>Hey.</i>

04:12.919 --> 04:16.172
So, I think
they're gonna eat it.

04:16.255 --> 04:19.467
Sandi is processing,
Stewy loves it,

04:19.550 --> 04:21.427
Roman led. No Karl, no Frank.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.012
Um... Sandi wants your take,

04:23.096 --> 04:24.180
Gerri's trying
to fill your boots,

04:24.263 --> 04:25.431
but I don't think
Sandi's buying it,

04:25.515 --> 04:27.684
and I'm just following them
now to the boardroom.

04:27.767 --> 04:28.977
Are you in the car?

04:30.436 --> 04:31.729
No. I'm gonna call in.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.400
Well, that works.
Is everything okay, honey?

04:35.483 --> 04:36.651
Yeah, I just...

04:36.734 --> 04:39.445
I'm feeling the way
I was feeling still, so...

04:41.239 --> 04:42.699
What about your mom's wedding?

04:43.574 --> 04:45.201
I'm not feeling great,

04:45.284 --> 04:47.537
so there's nothing really
to say.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.080
Right. Right.

04:49.163 --> 04:52.750
Well, maybe you don't even
really need to go.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.794
To Mom's wedding?

04:55.253 --> 04:56.254
Oh yeah!

04:56.337 --> 04:57.880
Fuck that,
I'd never hear the end of it.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.215
Can you imagine?

04:59.298 --> 05:02.176
So, the board members
not physically available

05:02.260 --> 05:03.594
will be joining by phone,

05:03.678 --> 05:06.305
including Siobhan Roy,
who sends her apologies.

05:06.389 --> 05:07.807
She's working on strategy.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.225
- And Kendall Roy--
<i>Hey.</i>

05:09.308 --> 05:13.479
Hey. And Kendall Roy who's not
attending due to illness.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.982
- And we're gonna lead off--
<i>That's not actually true.</i>

05:17.734 --> 05:19.068
And we're gonna
lead off with an update

05:19.152 --> 05:22.947
on the promising developments
in the ongoing investigation

05:23.031 --> 05:25.074
from which portion
of the meeting

05:25.158 --> 05:28.202
Kendall and Logan Roy
are recused.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.370
Hence...

05:29.454 --> 05:32.248
And then we'll move on
to discuss acquisitions.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.751
Is he gonna watch?

05:34.834 --> 05:37.420
I feel like I'm taking a shit
in the Guggenheim, y'all.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.882
Could we make a note in the
minutes that he's watching us?

05:50.933 --> 05:52.351
Hey, I know you.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.854
Didn't you used to be
Siobhan Roy?

05:54.937 --> 05:57.231
You sounded dumb
at the board meeting.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.692
At least, I showed up.
What were you doing?

05:59.776 --> 06:04.030
Brunching with some other sock
puppet girl-boss presidents?

06:04.113 --> 06:06.074
You haven't got a date?
Did no one on Raya

06:06.157 --> 06:08.576
wanna come to Italy
and sit on your Ricotta dick?

06:11.287 --> 06:16.209
So, just to say, I had, uh,
Peter Onions rat-fucked.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.002
Oh, what a lovely
wedding present!

06:18.086 --> 06:21.464
The guy's a fucking
slime badger.

06:21.547 --> 06:25.134
Um... Three bankruptcies,
two marriages, four children,

06:25.218 --> 06:26.928
and five shell companies.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.597
He's a big investor
in shitty nursing homes,

06:29.680 --> 06:31.057
tipping applesauce
down their gullets

06:31.140 --> 06:32.975
and telling them
they had a four-course dinner.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.310
- All the hits.
Yup.

06:34.393 --> 06:38.397
So, I've asked Mom
if we can talk to her,

06:38.481 --> 06:40.441
and I think
we should do it together.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.111
Do what?

06:44.487 --> 06:46.114
"Do what?" Uh-- Like,

06:46.197 --> 06:48.491
ask her if she should be
doing this, you know?

06:48.574 --> 06:51.619
It's like, five months since
Rory was supposed to move in.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.496
Whatever.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.748
Or we can at least...

06:55.832 --> 06:57.750
...check that she's getting
a prenup.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.419
You know, there's a lot of shit
in there from the divorce,

07:00.503 --> 07:01.629
the holding company
and everything.

07:01.712 --> 07:04.715
And the guy is clearly
on the make, so, yeah?

07:05.758 --> 07:06.759
Fuck it.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.846
Ser-- Fuck it?

07:09.929 --> 07:12.098
Yeah.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.392
Hm. She's probably
in sexual thrall to him.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.394
Hm.
- He's driving her wild
with his sugar dick.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.771
Nice.
- So there's nothing
that we can do.

07:18.855 --> 07:19.856
Uh-huh. All right, fine.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.899
Let him kill her
for her emeralds and...

07:21.983 --> 07:24.360
screw us out
of the fucking firm.
See if I care.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.070
Hey, Rome! About the deal!
- Oh.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.697
I was talking
to Karl and Frank.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.992
Yeah, no, but you're not really
a part of that, either of you.

07:31.075 --> 07:32.076
Well, I am.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.163
Well, I can't quite
fire you yet, Shiv,

07:35.246 --> 07:36.789
because I'm still
a little bit scared of you.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.666
But my thinking is,
when I take over,

07:38.749 --> 07:40.710
I'm gonna put you
in the office next to mine,

07:40.793 --> 07:42.753
and you're gonna be
my sexy secretary.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.047
The fuck is
wrong with you?

07:45.131 --> 07:46.966
I dunno.
We're working on it.

07:48.467 --> 07:49.552
Ongoing process.

08:07.403 --> 08:10.031
Welcome. Follow me.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.424
Oh! Uh-- Just a minute.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.301
- Hello!
Hey, Mom.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.094
Hello, welcome all!

08:32.178 --> 08:33.554
Goodness me!

08:33.638 --> 08:35.389
Did you just come back
from the front?

08:36.182 --> 08:38.601
Yeah. Just felt like it.

08:38.684 --> 08:39.977
- Hmm!
- I'm stripping down.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.354
It's nice.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.399
Hello, darlings! How are you?

08:45.483 --> 08:48.402
How lovely to see you!

08:48.486 --> 08:49.946
Don't you look lovely!

08:50.029 --> 08:53.407
So, um, you're all going to be
taken up to the house.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.995
I'll be there in a minute, guys.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.541
You look rather tired.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.460
Thanks.
You wanted a word?

09:04.543 --> 09:06.337
Right. Yes. Um...

09:06.420 --> 09:08.130
So, listen.
What I wanted to ask you--

09:08.214 --> 09:09.715
You'll see when you go up
to the house

09:09.799 --> 09:11.592
that Peter has printed out

09:11.676 --> 09:14.512
this awful sort of itinerary
of events.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.807
You know, all the welcoming
and then the rehearsals,

09:17.890 --> 09:19.225
and the ceremonies, and--

09:19.308 --> 09:21.102
- Mm.
And, um,

09:21.185 --> 09:24.397
I wondered if we couldn't
slightly divvy them up?

09:26.774 --> 09:28.567
- As in?
- As in...

09:30.569 --> 09:33.614
your father would rather not,
as I understand it,

09:33.698 --> 09:36.534
be together with you, uh,
as far as possible.

09:36.617 --> 09:37.743
And so, what-- what--

09:37.827 --> 09:40.621
what is your son getting?

09:40.705 --> 09:44.000
And what is your ex-husband,
who you hate, getting?

09:44.083 --> 09:46.794
Oh. Please don't get
on your high horse.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.921
It's not me,
I don't mind. It's...

09:49.588 --> 09:51.173
Bridezilla.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.300
He's got his heart set

09:52.383 --> 09:54.010
on having
all the important people

09:54.093 --> 09:55.803
at his wedding.
He's such a little tart.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.513
Well, I don't know
if that works.

09:57.596 --> 09:59.140
Please, have a think.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.058
You know,
I'll still see you tons.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.395
Yeah?

10:07.106 --> 10:08.107
Peter!

10:08.190 --> 10:09.525
Come and say hello to Kendall!

10:09.608 --> 10:11.235
Ah!

10:14.196 --> 10:16.032
Kendall, like the mint cake.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.035
- Yeah. Pleased to meet you.
Absolutely.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.871
Okay. Mom, I'll check
the schedule, uh,

10:21.954 --> 10:23.164
maybe see you next month.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.416
- Come on, don't be so dramatic.
- Nice to meet you.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.835
It's gonna be
about four hours, Kendall.

10:57.865 --> 10:58.824
Hello.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.619
Hello. I am Gerri Kellman.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.496
- Viola. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

11:03.579 --> 11:04.705
This is very nice.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.754
What a place!

11:11.837 --> 11:14.799
Italy! Pizza, pasta, and popes!

11:16.175 --> 11:18.052
You ever met the pope, Con?

11:18.135 --> 11:19.428
- Yeah, uh-huh.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.596
I met one.

11:20.679 --> 11:23.140
Couple of popes back, with Dad.

11:23.224 --> 11:27.269
- He was a real full-fat pope.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.562
Complete pope.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.231
Very religious.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.024
I guess he really drank
the Kool-Aid, huh?

11:32.733 --> 11:33.734
Wow.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.153
It's pretty.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.907
Everything okay, Con?

11:39.990 --> 11:41.575
Yup. Yeah.

11:42.827 --> 11:43.869
Just, uh...

11:45.162 --> 11:49.083
the guy from Politico, uh,
asking regarding his piece.

11:49.166 --> 11:52.795
Your full name and,
like, your employment history,

11:52.878 --> 11:54.380
- and whatnot.
- Oh, right.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.632
- You think he's digging?
- Might be friendly.

11:57.299 --> 11:58.801
But, you know,

11:58.884 --> 12:00.469
probably not. What do you think?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.304
Yeah, it's probably friendly.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.140
'Cause journalists are
so fucking friendly

12:04.223 --> 12:05.766
in my experience.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.903
- Okay.

12:17.987 --> 12:18.988
Hey!

12:19.071 --> 12:20.406
- Going to the welcome drinks?

12:20.489 --> 12:23.451
Sure. Uh-- Let me just, um,
check on Laurie, and then

12:23.534 --> 12:26.120
you and I can put our heads
together on the GoJo price.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.038
- Mm. Okay.
It's ticking up,
but nothing scary.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.081
Laurie, Laurie, Laurie.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.958
You just will not stop
going on about him.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.043
I think you're obsessed,
and frankly, it's disgusting.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.337
Um-- Laurie,
we're gonna walk down.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.839
- Can you catch up?
- Yeah. Okay.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.507
Okay, cool.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.468
- Okay. So, look,

12:40.551 --> 12:42.636
- I need to talk to you.
- Hi.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.347
- I-- I need
to ask you something.
- Okay.

12:45.764 --> 12:46.765
Um...

12:48.184 --> 12:52.563
I need you to stop sending me
the, um, items.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.107
The which?

12:56.358 --> 12:58.152
The dick pics?

12:59.445 --> 13:01.989
You... don't want
pictures of my dick?

13:02.072 --> 13:03.616
- No.
- Okay.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.035
Kind of offended. Are you sure?

13:06.118 --> 13:07.286
- Yes, I'm sure.
- Okay.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.454
I'm fucking serious, Roman!

13:08.537 --> 13:11.165
I'm not so sure, I feel like
you do want them,

13:11.248 --> 13:13.083
but you're being kind
of typically minxy.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.504
I think this happens when
you're under pressure or...

13:16.587 --> 13:19.006
But you need to find
some other outlet, Roman.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.510
Look at you,
trying to get inside my head.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.136
Don't open Pandora's Box.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.222
There's just more
dicks in there.

13:37.816 --> 13:39.818
No, she has
a lovely house, quite.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.737
- Hey, Mother. Sorry.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.155
- Roman!
Hi.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.491
- Hello!

13:45.574 --> 13:47.159
Roman, you know Peter.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.452
- Yep. Oh.
- Yeah.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.372
Peter, Roman's worried in case
I'm throwing myself away.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.416
- He thinks I'm in thrall to you.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.751
Other way around.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.712
Well, how you doin'?

13:58.796 --> 14:00.422
Very excited about all this.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.591
Yeah, yeah. Of course. Me too.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.260
And, uh, how's, uh, business?

14:04.343 --> 14:07.221
I hear you're big
in the old silvery gulags!

14:07.304 --> 14:09.765
Yes. Helping to, uh,

14:09.848 --> 14:11.433
turn around
a nursing home group.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.768
We, uh-- It's very rewarding.

14:12.851 --> 14:13.978
Come in...

14:14.061 --> 14:15.771
...look at the operations,
trim the fat.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.773
Yeah.
He means the nurses.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.151
She's very rude. I don't know
why I put up with it.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.070
And I'm very rude to you!

14:26.073 --> 14:28.617
He is awful,
I can obviously see that.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.412
No. No, no, no, not at all.
He's actually just your type.

14:31.495 --> 14:35.040
Another in the line of post-dad,
posh, English phonies.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.626
He's not posh.
His father's a doctor.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.962
Bought all his own furniture.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.922
Yeah, he's a grasping little
scholarship boy.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.799
Well, take it easy there,
Mother.

14:43.882 --> 14:45.926
That's my stepfather
you're talking about.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.136
Oh...

14:47.219 --> 14:50.764
he's forcing me into
all of this, this Toscana bit.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.017
But he is tremendous fun.
I mean, look at him,

14:53.100 --> 14:56.061
fizzing away over there like
a bottle of cheap prosecco.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.896
- Hmm. Very cheap.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.860
Uh... Mom? Um...

15:02.943 --> 15:07.656
Well, you know that I'm not
a big one for saying things...

15:07.740 --> 15:11.785
but I'm just gonna say,
are you...

15:11.869 --> 15:14.330
are you sure?
The guy has, like, four kids.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.415
He's got a lot more
than that, my darling.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.292
Oh, great. That's fantastic.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.002
There's a prenup though, right?

15:20.085 --> 15:22.171
Oh, come on.
Don't be so unromantic.

15:22.254 --> 15:26.050
Mom, just-- I'm concerned
that maybe you're rushing this.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.010
So what do you
expect me to survive on?

15:28.093 --> 15:30.638
Macaroni and memorial services?

15:43.400 --> 15:44.485
So?

15:44.568 --> 15:46.570
Uh-- Yeah, she says
she can't live off...

15:46.654 --> 15:48.739
...macaroni
and memorial services.

15:48.822 --> 15:50.324
Oh, wow!

15:50.407 --> 15:52.076
Poor old Eleanor Rigby
wants to eat dick

15:52.159 --> 15:54.244
and drink champagne for
the rest of her life instead?

15:54.328 --> 15:56.872
Yeah, apparently,
we're meant to hate Peter

15:56.955 --> 15:59.124
because he was smart enough
to get a scholarship

15:59.208 --> 16:01.460
and bought his own furniture.

16:01.543 --> 16:04.672
What else do we got?
Any-- Any requests?

16:04.755 --> 16:07.007
- Any offers?
- No, not really.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.218
Uh... There's a sit-down.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.178
Like a podcast...

16:11.261 --> 16:12.638
-...uh, that's basically...
- Okay.

16:12.721 --> 16:16.058
...like ex-Globe journalists
who are doing sort of like a--

16:16.141 --> 16:17.726
Kinda like the Kennedys.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.770
"Curse of the Roys," deep dive.

16:19.853 --> 16:22.272
Uh-- They're doing
Connor's mom, and...

16:22.356 --> 16:24.483
uh, your dad
and someone named Rose

16:24.566 --> 16:26.819
and then the tabloid suicides.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.320
There's like a kid
who was bullied,

16:28.404 --> 16:30.698
and was it an accident
or did he kill himself?

16:30.781 --> 16:33.450
He was the caterer at your
sister's wedding, I guess.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.910
Do you know about this?

16:35.953 --> 16:36.870
Uh-huh. Sure.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.205
Right, so they're
spraying requests

16:38.288 --> 16:39.373
around the whole family.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.711
Maybe...

16:43.794 --> 16:46.296
- keep tabs on that one, okay?
Okay.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.257
Fucking bottom feeders.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.093
Um... So unless it's weird,
I might fuck off?

16:51.176 --> 16:52.261
Yeah. Whatever.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.804
- Clock the fuck off.
Okay.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.686
Hey.
- Hey!

17:02.104 --> 17:03.063
Okay!

17:03.147 --> 17:05.858
- Very nice. How-- How we doin'?

17:05.941 --> 17:07.901
- Good, great. Yeah.
Yeah.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.028
I'm great--

17:09.820 --> 17:10.821
Oh, shit.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.322
- Phone stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Sorry.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.782
No, no, uh, go for it.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.457
- Thank you.
- Well, congratulations, Greg.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.542
Yeah. Punching above
your weight?

17:24.501 --> 17:26.003
- Oh, Comfry?
- Mm-hmm.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.129
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.798
Yeah, I like her, I like her.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.342
I do wonder...

17:32.426 --> 17:34.470
Can you hold this?
-...is there depth there?

17:34.553 --> 17:37.556
Sure.
- Like, is-- I don't--
is there substance?

17:37.639 --> 17:38.974
Depth?

17:39.057 --> 17:40.809
Oh my God!

17:40.893 --> 17:42.102
The man dying of thirst

17:42.186 --> 17:44.521
is suddenly
a mineral water critic?

17:44.605 --> 17:47.608
Does Comfry not sate
your lust for wisdom, Greg?

17:47.691 --> 17:49.651
It's such a shame Sontag's
not still alive.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.320
You could take her
to the drive-though.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.530
Maybe, I wonder,

17:53.614 --> 17:57.159
when she gets to know
the quote-unquote "real me,"

17:57.242 --> 17:58.410
uh, will she stick around?

17:58.494 --> 18:00.537
Well, I guess either way,
if doesn't work out,

18:00.621 --> 18:02.456
she's a great date ladder.

18:02.539 --> 18:04.625
Wh-- Excuse me?
As-- As in?

18:04.708 --> 18:07.169
Well, you know,
people will see her with you.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.213
And no offense, but they'll say,

18:09.296 --> 18:11.673
"What the fuck's
going on there?"

18:11.757 --> 18:13.008
"Why is he with her?"

18:13.091 --> 18:15.135
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I'm aware
of what you're saying.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.221
Okay.
It still could work
for you.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.973
Date ladder!
Play the date ladder game!

18:21.934 --> 18:22.851
What-- What about her?

18:22.935 --> 18:24.102
- She looks nice.
Well, yeah.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.270
Hmm. Yeah.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.439
- I mean, yeah, why not?

18:27.523 --> 18:28.816
- She's pretty.
- She is very pretty.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.109
She's also a princess
or a duchess or something.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.444
- Yeah.
- But sure. Yeah.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.821
- Why-- Why not?
- Why not?

18:33.904 --> 18:34.988
We put a man on the moon.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.326
Oh.

18:39.409 --> 18:40.661
Oh...
Oh...

18:40.744 --> 18:42.579
Okay.
Okay. Wow.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.248
Poor woman, she probably...

18:45.374 --> 18:47.209
She thinks she met
a fun guy at a wedding.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.795
He should be colored red
like a dangerous lizard.

18:49.878 --> 18:52.464
Oh, no. Scary Poppins
is on maneuvers.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.549
Can you, no, just--

18:53.632 --> 18:54.967
- just block me from her?
Blocking you.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.844
You know, she knows
that I'm not in a good place

18:56.927 --> 18:58.220
and then it's all...

18:58.303 --> 18:59.930
<i>...House of Flying Daggers,</i>
you know?

19:00.013 --> 19:01.390
Sure.
-"How's your marriage going?

19:01.473 --> 19:02.558
Are you gonna have children?"

19:02.641 --> 19:03.725
How is your marriage going?

19:03.809 --> 19:04.852
- Oh.
- Are you gonna have children?

19:04.935 --> 19:06.979
- Okay. Ha-ha.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.648
Mm. Karolina.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.195
Uh-- Tom. Matsson.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.824
- What? Going to Macao?
- The fuck!

19:18.907 --> 19:20.200
Feeling lucky?
What the fuck is that?

19:20.284 --> 19:21.785
You see this thing
from Karolina?

19:21.869 --> 19:24.830
It's off the radar and now this?
Is it-- Is this a move?

19:24.913 --> 19:27.207
It, um, could be...

19:27.291 --> 19:28.542
It could be nothing, you know?

19:28.625 --> 19:30.085
Fucking social media fireworks!

19:30.168 --> 19:31.795
"Going to Macao, feeling lucky."

19:31.879 --> 19:33.422
Is he trying
to boost his price?

19:33.505 --> 19:34.673
Is he just
rocking the boat

19:34.756 --> 19:36.508
or trying to blow up the deal?
I mean, has he got good

19:36.592 --> 19:38.760
- subscriber numbers coming in?
- Maybe he's just going to Macao

19:38.844 --> 19:40.345
and he's feeling lucky.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.388
Maybe...

19:41.471 --> 19:43.473
Hey, Lukas! Call me!
Are you high?

19:43.557 --> 19:46.935
I think you should put down
the venti ayahuasca Big Gulp.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.605
Uh-- We need to be inside track
on these tweets, man, okay?

19:49.688 --> 19:50.731
Call me.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.149
I don't know,
it's like it's his thing.

19:52.232 --> 19:53.275
He's a--
He's a trickster.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.110
Okay. Well, sounds cool.
Is he gonna, like,

19:55.193 --> 19:57.613
steal our watches and saw
the fucking deal in half?

19:58.196 --> 19:59.156
Maybe.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.741
You're supposed to be
inside this, Rome.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.743
I am inside this. Leave it.

20:02.826 --> 20:04.161
Hey, nice work, Rome.

20:04.661 --> 20:05.537
Hey.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.247
- Matsson going nut-nut.
Mm-hmm.

20:07.331 --> 20:08.540
Keep hold
of that shit, bro.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.250
It's all under control,
motherfucker.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.127
Yeah?
- Yeah. Where are you off to?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.378
Naples, score some junk?

20:13.462 --> 20:15.797
No, just our mother
throwing me out of her party.

20:15.881 --> 20:16.840
Oh, nice!

20:16.924 --> 20:18.967
- Good. Well, so long.
- Where are my kids?

20:19.051 --> 20:21.762
Hey, hey, guys!
Where the fuck are my kids?

20:21.845 --> 20:24.806
What a surprise!
Ken doesn't know
where his kids are.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.893
- So look, um,
I've been thinking.
- Mm.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.436
Who knows what'll happen?

20:30.145 --> 20:31.355
Maybe I won't ignite?

20:31.438 --> 20:36.818
Uh... Maybe the two-party system
isn't as rotten as it looks.

20:36.902 --> 20:40.530
- But I have to plan
for success. So, Willa...

20:40.614 --> 20:43.075
this is a difficult
conversation to have.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.453
Oh, okay.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.288
- So, you're okay?

20:48.372 --> 20:52.292
Yeah, I don't-- Just, uh, no,
go on and just...

20:52.376 --> 20:55.087
We can go back underground.

20:55.170 --> 20:58.590
Me in my apartment in the city.
You come visit. It's...

20:58.674 --> 21:00.092
kind of romantic!

21:00.175 --> 21:01.677
That doesn't work for me. No.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.971
- Okay.
- Maxim had an idea...

21:06.264 --> 21:07.474
which is...

21:09.518 --> 21:10.477
Ooh!

21:10.560 --> 21:12.562
Will you make me...

21:12.646 --> 21:15.273
the most happiest man...

21:16.358 --> 21:20.112
slash most bulletproof candidate
in the world?

21:20.195 --> 21:21.446
Oh...

21:21.530 --> 21:23.115
Oh... okay.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.826
- Okay?
Oh, no. I-- No, I mean--

21:27.577 --> 21:28.620
Baby.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.747
Baby.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.416
People are looking, Willa.

21:35.293 --> 21:38.296
Well, then
I'd be pleased to say...

21:39.464 --> 21:41.883
Yes, yes, yes. Can I...

21:42.926 --> 21:45.178
Can I have a little think on it?

21:45.804 --> 21:47.764
If it's okay...

21:47.848 --> 21:50.434
- I'm smiling now...
Right.

21:50.517 --> 21:52.227
...like you said yes.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.603
Okay.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.022
So, take your time.
Right.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.568
- Wow!
- So, GoJo's price

21:59.651 --> 22:01.111
is moving up and fucking up.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.529
Yeah. I think
he played you, Rome.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.032
Mm.
- SEC's gonna be all over this.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.825
Ooh, yeah!
Oh, my goodness!

22:06.908 --> 22:09.119
Gummy love bite
from the fucking toddlers.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.705
I think he likes us, I do.
I can feel that in my gut.

22:11.788 --> 22:14.624
Okay. Uh... another one.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.586
controller,
fingers crossed, eggplant.

22:17.669 --> 22:21.757
Maybe he's trying to fuck
a gaming site something with...

22:21.840 --> 22:23.759
Look, Rome.
This is bad.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.969
I... I think we're good.

22:26.053 --> 22:29.514
Oh, yeah? If he blows this deal,
then who is left for us exactly?

22:29.598 --> 22:30.766
We could become the fucking

22:30.849 --> 22:34.644
Pan-American Waystar-Blockbuster
Video dial-up Corporation.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.021
Okay.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.481
Here he comes.

22:37.564 --> 22:39.232
And here she comes.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.401
He does not give a single...

22:41.485 --> 22:43.236
- No.
-...solitary fuck.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.613
- No.
Maybe it's all fine.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.573
Maybe they just share
a big bed together

22:46.656 --> 22:49.868
and they watch <i>Friends</i> reruns
and drink milkshakes-- Oh.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.245
Well, your father made it,
it would appear.

22:52.329 --> 22:53.413
And you know the story?

22:53.497 --> 22:56.291
What? The skunk, the porcupine,
and the concubine?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.794
It's probably the best wedding
present I'll ever get.

22:58.877 --> 23:01.213
But... so disgusting.

23:01.296 --> 23:03.465
Is he still fucking Marcia,
do we think?

23:03.548 --> 23:06.468
- Uh-- I think not, is the word.
Hope not.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.637
Poor old fellow would probably
keel over with the effort.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.640
Oh, well, I gotta go around
telling everybody

23:11.723 --> 23:14.309
to be very discreet.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.644
- Oh, and Shiv.
Uh-huh?

23:15.727 --> 23:17.604
You know about this
awful thing later on?

23:17.687 --> 23:19.147
Oh, uh...

23:19.231 --> 23:21.775
Yeah, uh, Rome and I
have got a big--

23:21.858 --> 23:22.818
We're working on a big deal,

23:22.901 --> 23:24.402
and so, um-- We just got hit
by a torpedo

23:24.486 --> 23:26.696
- and it's not a thing
that I can--
- Oh, Shiv. Don't be silly.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.365
Go have fun with Mom.
I can manage.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.825
It's-- She's not even
that involved.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.202
Yeah?

23:32.285 --> 23:35.288
- See you later.
Hmm. You're welcome.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.124
- Fuck you.
- Logan, you came.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.208
How you doing?

23:38.291 --> 23:40.001
Staying ahead
of the Inland Revenue?

23:40.085 --> 23:42.462
Welcome to Toscana.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.839
Oh, glad to be here.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.299
Anything I can do,
just let me know.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.676
Very kind.

23:47.759 --> 23:51.555
When we get the chance, I wanted
a discreet word with you about,

23:51.638 --> 23:54.099
uh, your-- your contacts
in the UK government.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.892
- Uh-huh?
It's just, I'd...

23:55.976 --> 23:59.104
like to give something back,
you know, the chance to serve.

23:59.187 --> 24:01.231
Hmm.
Logan?

24:01.314 --> 24:02.607
Ah.

24:06.862 --> 24:07.946
Hmm.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.240
And what did he want?

24:10.323 --> 24:12.951
He wants me to get
the dipshits in Downing Street

24:13.034 --> 24:17.122
to make him Lord Fucking
Seat Sniffer Pantyhose.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.333
- Did you read the tweet?
- Yup.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.085
- Have you spoken?
- Uh-- I tried, but--

24:22.169 --> 24:25.213
Well, I'm not used
to negotiating via eggplant.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.716
I'm not sure he wants the deal.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.509
He might just run
a fucking moussaka.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.052
You want to try
calling him again?

24:31.136 --> 24:32.304
Hmm.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.016
Um... Okay.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.684
As long as he doesn't come here.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.395
Uh-- No. Hey, hey, you okay?

24:40.478 --> 24:41.897
Yeah, I'm okay. Hey, Dad?

24:41.980 --> 24:43.773
Um-- Ken, he doesn't wanna
see you. He doesn't wanna
talk to you.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.442
Yeah, well, this
is all total horseshit.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.943
We had a deal. Jesus Christ.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.070
Let's just
have it out, okay?

24:49.154 --> 24:51.656
I wanna see you, Dad.
I wanna see you for dinner,

24:51.740 --> 24:54.284
and let's just nail this, okay?

24:54.826 --> 24:56.077
Eight.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.121
On your own. Yeah?

24:59.122 --> 25:00.498
He's busy.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.668
Sure.
- We'll get back to him.

25:03.752 --> 25:07.756
- We'll get back to you.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.300
Oh, you'll--
you'll get back to me?
Mm-hmm.

25:10.675 --> 25:11.718
You prick.

25:14.262 --> 25:15.597
Should I go?

25:15.680 --> 25:17.265
I don't know,
maybe wear a stab vest.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.644
I mean, it'll be okay,
maybe you should go.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.062
Get him out of the firm.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.233
- You want me to come with you?
Oh, fuck off.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.777
I'm not scared.
Get me some rooms.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.196
I wanna get Matsson
on the phone.

25:41.998 --> 25:45.293
Hello!
Welcome, welcome!

25:53.885 --> 25:55.637
We're almost there.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.419
Hey.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.837
- Sorry, just--
Oh, hi.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.255
Hey, just busy.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.716
Managed to tear yourself away?

26:33.925 --> 26:36.344
What do you think
of Peter's daughters?

26:36.428 --> 26:38.972
They're both in interior design.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.307
They're unemployed.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.142
Yeah. They...
...offered to take photos

26:42.225 --> 26:44.728
and I think they exported
my address book.

26:44.811 --> 26:45.895
No.
- Yeah.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.105
God.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.941
The bachelorette party!

26:50.025 --> 26:52.110
My mother would
turn in her grave.

26:54.654 --> 26:57.782
Uh... Hey,
Rome is kinda concerned.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.826
You do have
a watertight prenup, right?

26:59.909 --> 27:03.538
Do you think he's gonna do me in
for Granny's fake Rubens?

27:03.621 --> 27:04.998
You've got a good lawyer,
at least?

27:05.081 --> 27:08.543
Yeah, sure. I'm actually having
to open up the divorce agreement

27:08.626 --> 27:12.213
with your father because Peter
loves the Eaton Square flat.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.382
Has he not got one of his own?

27:14.466 --> 27:15.800
He had a bit of bad luck

27:15.884 --> 27:17.886
with a salmon-smoking business

27:17.969 --> 27:20.930
and he lost
his place in Pimlico.

27:21.473 --> 27:22.557
Ooh.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.476
Quite the business brain.

27:24.559 --> 27:26.061
Got a very big heart.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.438
Well, I suppose
opposites attract.

27:31.107 --> 27:32.901
Should we just enjoy a fag?

27:33.818 --> 27:36.029
And not do any sniping
for a bit?

27:36.112 --> 27:38.031
Or have you come
to get some attention?

27:38.114 --> 27:40.700
Me? Attention from you? Oh, no.

27:40.784 --> 27:41.868
That ship sailed long ago.

27:41.951 --> 27:43.620
Yeah. I might have been
a bit of a spotty mother,

27:43.703 --> 27:45.789
but you've been
a shitty daughter, so...

27:47.624 --> 27:49.459
You weren't a spotty mother,
you were just...

27:51.086 --> 27:54.005
an absence. But I'm fine.

27:54.089 --> 27:56.966
I moved back to bloody New York
so I could be near you,

27:57.050 --> 27:58.802
and I never fucking saw you!

27:58.885 --> 28:00.261
Mom, it's okay.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.429
It's fine.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.432
You let Dad take us
and it was probably best.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.102
I gave him custody
so you could keep your shares

28:07.185 --> 28:09.229
and I could protect
your interests.

28:09.312 --> 28:10.397
You chose.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.942
"I'll have the carbonara
and Daddy, please."

28:14.025 --> 28:15.443
I didn't choose anything.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.445
You tend to get
what you want anyway.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.155
And you don't?

28:19.239 --> 28:20.824
I don't think I've ever won

28:20.907 --> 28:23.576
a single battle
in my whole life.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.161
Hmm.

28:25.745 --> 28:26.955
I was ten, Mom.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.289
I was a fucking kid.

28:29.999 --> 28:31.251
You were 13.

28:32.460 --> 28:33.962
And you knew
how to twist the knife.

28:34.045 --> 28:36.589
You knew then,
and you know now.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.050
And I might cry.

28:40.718 --> 28:42.095
Oh, yeah, where's the onion?

28:43.555 --> 28:45.723
You were quite a piece of work.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.394
You were my onion.

28:51.646 --> 28:54.274
- You are my onion.
Yeah, well,

28:54.357 --> 28:55.775
you're my fucking onion.

29:05.535 --> 29:08.079
Truth is, I probably should
never have had children.

29:12.625 --> 29:15.170
You made the right decision.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.922
Some people just aren't made
to be mothers.

29:21.384 --> 29:22.760
I should've had dogs.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.182
Well, you could've had dogs.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.684
No,
not with your father.

29:29.767 --> 29:32.562
He never saw anything he loved
that he didn't wanna kick it

29:32.645 --> 29:34.606
just to see if it
would still come back.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.449
Okay, what's this?

29:45.492 --> 29:47.368
Okay, so your dad called a bunch

29:47.452 --> 29:48.870
and Matsson won't
take the calls.

29:48.953 --> 29:50.622
Matsson hates the phone.

29:50.705 --> 29:52.040
That's nothing. I told Dad that.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.167
- He left me a voice memo.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.710
The tweets were just
fucking around.

29:55.793 --> 29:58.838
His lawyers have given him
the Reg FD scares.

29:58.922 --> 30:00.215
He's flying back
to his Swiss place.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.549
There's clarification coming.

30:01.633 --> 30:02.926
Yeah. Well, your dad thinks

30:03.009 --> 30:05.094
Matsson's trying
to humiliate him.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.763
Well, he's not.

30:06.846 --> 30:08.681
So, Dad just needs
to ride it out.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.517
I don't think we
need to panic, Gerri. Okay?

30:10.600 --> 30:12.477
- I'm not panicking!
- I think you are!

30:12.560 --> 30:14.521
Because you're interrupting
a great night.

30:14.604 --> 30:16.314
I'm getting very pally
with Laurie.

30:16.397 --> 30:17.815
I might try to fuck him,
see how that...

30:17.899 --> 30:19.359
fits into our disgusting mess.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.236
Do not try
to fuck Laurie.

30:21.319 --> 30:23.279
What do you think
about going to see Matsson?

30:24.197 --> 30:26.032
Yeah. Sure.
Does Dad want me to?

30:26.115 --> 30:27.951
Yes. Your dad wants the deal.

30:28.034 --> 30:30.537
But, you know,
they need a translator.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.331
Logan needs reassurance
before the banker meet.

30:33.414 --> 30:35.667
Okay, so you want me
to save the deal?

30:35.750 --> 30:37.585
Why didn't you say so?
Piece of cake.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.921
Save the deal, fuck Laurie,

30:40.004 --> 30:41.965
lead the company
into the promised land,

30:42.048 --> 30:43.174
fuck Gerri...

30:44.175 --> 30:45.593
It's gonna be a great week.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.493
Hey.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.328
I-- I thought this
was gonna be private.

31:12.412 --> 31:15.248
I'm across
a lot of shit and, uh,

31:15.331 --> 31:16.791
she's monitoring.

31:16.874 --> 31:19.752
Hang out wherever.
You-- You guys can wait inside.

31:29.554 --> 31:33.141
So I hear you were asking
all about the menu and my chef.

31:33.224 --> 31:36.144
Some things are off the menu
for me health-wise.

31:36.227 --> 31:39.439
You scared I'm gonna try
and Jim Jones you with an olive?

31:39.522 --> 31:42.400
Well, I-- I think they've
brought some food

31:42.483 --> 31:43.943
that's good for me.

31:44.027 --> 31:46.988
Yeah. It seems a shame.
You know, Marco's a great chef.

31:47.071 --> 31:51.367
So, we checked in with your doc
and got the requirements.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.745
So, what is all this?

31:53.828 --> 31:55.663
You know,
I-- I got a lot to do.

31:56.122 --> 31:57.123
As ever.

31:57.206 --> 32:00.918
GoJo price is spiking
and your pal, Matsson,

32:01.002 --> 32:02.795
has got a screw loose.

32:02.879 --> 32:03.963
So,

32:04.047 --> 32:06.341
I just wanted to talk to you,
I suppose.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.468
Look, I don't wanna
get into it all right now

32:08.551 --> 32:11.346
because if it's bullshit,
I'll just leave.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.514
Can we be civil
and not pull our guts out

32:13.598 --> 32:14.807
all over the table?

32:16.017 --> 32:17.685
Sure.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.271
Uh-- That-- That--
That one's for him.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.208
- Where are the kids?
- They're inside.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.626
Iverson!

32:41.709 --> 32:43.086
I'd like to say hello.

32:44.003 --> 32:45.129
Sure.

32:45.963 --> 32:47.674
Hey, kiddo!

32:48.174 --> 32:49.300
How you doing?

32:49.842 --> 32:50.843
Good.

32:51.636 --> 32:52.762
You like mozzarella?

32:53.346 --> 32:54.847
Um... Not much.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.100
Try this.

32:59.519 --> 33:00.812
There you go, try it.

33:08.611 --> 33:10.697
Yeah. It's okay.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.908
Off you go, go on.

33:13.991 --> 33:16.452
Kerry has got something
for you in there, I think.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.747
Good night, buddy.
Night.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.793
Who do you think I am?

33:25.336 --> 33:27.213
You think I want you dead?

33:27.296 --> 33:28.840
I'll be broken when you die.

33:30.508 --> 33:31.509
Mm-hmm.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.137
How's the boy doing?

33:34.220 --> 33:35.555
Is he getting better?

33:35.638 --> 33:36.931
He's-- He's fine.

33:39.517 --> 33:40.518
So, look...

33:42.729 --> 33:43.855
my thing is...

33:44.814 --> 33:45.815
I want out.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.944
I think I thought I was
a knight on horseback,

33:50.027 --> 33:51.904
but, yeah,
that isn't panning out.

33:51.988 --> 33:54.657
Life's not knights on horseback.

33:54.741 --> 33:56.617
It's a number
on a piece of paper.

33:57.785 --> 34:00.913
It's a fight
for a knife in the mud.

34:04.250 --> 34:07.378
Like,
I don't really know...

34:07.462 --> 34:09.380
where my life goes from here.

34:10.131 --> 34:11.132
Uh...

34:12.925 --> 34:14.010
Maybe, I...

34:14.719 --> 34:15.720
could...

34:16.554 --> 34:17.597
I don't know.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.348
But I can't do jack shit.

34:20.892 --> 34:21.976
So, here it is,

34:22.059 --> 34:24.479
I wanna get a premium payout
from the holding.

34:24.562 --> 34:27.398
Two-bill and a chunky asset.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.609
Something you can realize
without shareholder input.

34:29.692 --> 34:31.277
Maybe...

34:31.360 --> 34:33.654
I don't know, outdoor
advertising, podcasts.

34:33.738 --> 34:36.866
I keep Fikret, Jess,
and I'm gone.

34:36.949 --> 34:39.702
I'm a ghost, divested,
off the board,

34:39.786 --> 34:41.162
complete disinheritance.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.998
Won't even speak
at your memorial.

34:44.582 --> 34:45.625
We're done.

34:47.126 --> 34:49.754
Well, I need to think about it.

34:51.464 --> 34:52.632
Well, you--
you already--

34:52.715 --> 34:54.300
You offered at my birthday.

34:54.383 --> 34:57.428
- That was, uh, for fun.
- Dad...

34:57.512 --> 35:00.264
...we can't do
this bullshit forever.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.682
Maybe I want you close.

35:02.767 --> 35:06.270
You can do the mail,
keep you rattling around.

35:06.354 --> 35:07.730
I can't.

35:07.814 --> 35:11.567
I tried, but I-- I thought
that I could change things.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.694
But I'm not as...

35:16.072 --> 35:18.950
There's things you're able to do
that I can't.

35:19.575 --> 35:20.618
Maybe.

35:22.745 --> 35:23.746
Maybe.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.165
You've won...

35:27.750 --> 35:30.294
because you're corrupt
and so is the world.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.047
Hmm. Well...

35:33.130 --> 35:35.216
I'm better than you.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.885
You're-- You know,
I-- I-- I hate to say this,

35:37.969 --> 35:40.137
'cause I love you,
but you're kind of...

35:41.430 --> 35:42.390
evil.

35:42.473 --> 35:45.143
Don't talk about things
you don't understand.

35:45.226 --> 35:46.602
Well, you're smart,

35:46.686 --> 35:49.230
but what you've done is you--
you've-- you've...

35:49.313 --> 35:53.860
monetized all the fucking--
the-- the...

35:53.943 --> 35:56.529
American resentments
of class and race...

35:56.612 --> 35:58.614
And I thought I was just
telling folks the weather.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.367
You've turned
black bile into silver dollars.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.994
Oh, you just noticed, did you?

36:05.621 --> 36:06.956
Yeah, maybe I did.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.666
Oh, fuck off.

36:08.749 --> 36:10.877
Fine, you know what?

36:13.170 --> 36:14.380
I don't give a fuck.

36:15.172 --> 36:17.383
Not everyone can live this life.

36:19.927 --> 36:23.055
I'm a great revolutionary.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.641
A bit of fucking spice.

36:26.517 --> 36:27.643
Bit of fun.

36:27.727 --> 36:28.728
Fun?

36:29.186 --> 36:30.271
A bit of truth.

36:31.814 --> 36:33.357
Okay. Truth, okay.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.401
I fucking know things
about the world,

36:35.484 --> 36:37.820
or I wouldn't turn a buck.

36:37.904 --> 36:41.741
Maybe.
- Not necessarily nice things.

36:41.824 --> 36:43.159
Look, whatever.

36:43.618 --> 36:44.660
Let me out.

36:45.494 --> 36:46.913
Okay?

36:46.996 --> 36:48.581
Pay up and let me out.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.584
I don't wanna be you.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.669
I'm a good guy.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.637
How long was that kid alive...

37:02.720 --> 37:04.805
before he started
sucking in water?

37:07.141 --> 37:08.267
Couple of minutes?

37:08.976 --> 37:10.519
Three, four, five?

37:11.187 --> 37:13.397
Long time? Two minutes?

37:15.316 --> 37:18.486
What were you even doing, huh?
Chasing a bit of tail?

37:20.947 --> 37:22.615
Hey, are you queer?

37:23.991 --> 37:25.451
Did you try to fuck him?

37:27.495 --> 37:29.038
Or was it just the drugs?

37:31.791 --> 37:33.084
I'm better than you.

37:33.709 --> 37:34.794
Sure.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.004
You're my son.

37:39.298 --> 37:41.342
I did my best...

37:42.760 --> 37:45.346
and whenever you fucked up...

37:46.263 --> 37:48.683
I cleaned up your shit.

37:52.269 --> 37:53.896
And I'm a bad person?

37:56.941 --> 37:58.359
Fuck off, kiddo.

37:59.527 --> 38:00.569
Good night.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.698
We're out of here.

38:22.633 --> 38:23.884
Hey!

38:23.968 --> 38:25.094
Hey.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.387
How was your night?

38:26.470 --> 38:28.055
Awful, you?

38:28.139 --> 38:31.559
Yeah. Roman implied that Peter
might have killed his first wife

38:31.642 --> 38:33.227
and then he tried to goad Laurie

38:33.310 --> 38:35.479
into talking indelicately
about Gerri.

38:35.563 --> 38:39.525
(MOANS, KISSES) Hmm.

38:39.608 --> 38:40.860
Let's have a baby.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.070
- Yeah?
Uh-huh.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.864
Yeah.

38:44.947 --> 38:47.533
- I'm gonna fucking fight, Tom.
- Okay.

38:47.616 --> 38:50.036
Yeah. You don't
just get given these things

38:50.119 --> 38:51.537
in a house in
the fucking Hamptons.

38:51.620 --> 38:52.621
- Right. Right.
- No.

38:52.705 --> 38:55.875
You don't just get given
the top job, or ATN.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.918
I'm gonna have to fight for it.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.004
Gotta fight Gerri
and Roman and Ken.

39:00.087 --> 39:01.756
But I can 'cause
I'm smarter than them.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.257
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
Yeah!

39:03.340 --> 39:04.550
I'm gonna fucking do it!

39:04.633 --> 39:06.552
And fuck Dad, he can kick me
as many times as he wants.

39:06.635 --> 39:09.889
Like, ten or five years.

39:09.972 --> 39:12.099
Get rid of Cyd, remake ATN.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.476
Yeah.
- And destroy it.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.061
- Yes.
- Raze it to the ground, yeah?

39:15.144 --> 39:16.771
Right. I mean, except me.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.355
- Yeah! Yeah, except you!
- Yeah.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.066
You know, and Matsson's
got Dad spooked,

39:20.149 --> 39:22.401
so I'm gonna have to find him
a better deal, a bigger one.

39:22.485 --> 39:24.528
I'm gonna do it, and I'm gonna
fucking nail it, too!

39:24.612 --> 39:27.114
And what--
Uh-- What about me?

39:27.198 --> 39:28.449
- Wh--
- Uh-- And the--

39:28.532 --> 39:29.742
- Together! Yeah!
- Uh-huh.

39:29.825 --> 39:32.244
Because we can't let
the dirty little pixie
become king.

39:32.328 --> 39:34.246
- No.
- Yeah? Blow up Roman,

39:34.330 --> 39:36.499
and I'm the only candidate
left in the field.

39:38.417 --> 39:41.087
Let's do anything, yeah?
What do you...

39:41.170 --> 39:42.630
- Yeah. Uh...

39:42.713 --> 39:44.465
- What do you wanna do to me?

39:44.548 --> 39:46.467
- You're so fucking hot.
- Just tell-- tell me anything.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.094
Do anything to me.

39:48.177 --> 39:49.887
Um-- You-- You...

39:49.970 --> 39:51.514
You say anything to me.

39:52.264 --> 39:53.265
Go on...

39:53.933 --> 39:54.975
Mistress...

39:55.601 --> 39:56.769
Siobhan Roy.

39:58.187 --> 39:59.188
Go on.

40:02.316 --> 40:03.692
You're not good enough for me.

40:04.443 --> 40:06.112
Oh, right.

40:07.029 --> 40:08.656
Oh. I see.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.282
- Well, let's see about that.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

40:10.366 --> 40:11.617
No, I'm way out
of your fucking league.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.828
- Oh, you think so? Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.249
That's why you want me.

40:19.416 --> 40:21.669
- That's why...
Maybe.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.087
...you love me.

40:24.839 --> 40:26.006
Fuck you.

40:27.424 --> 40:29.301
Even though I don't love you.

40:31.345 --> 40:32.471
Uh-huh.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.932
But you want me anyway.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.511
- Hey!
- Hmm.

41:12.595 --> 41:14.638
- You crept out!
- Yeah.

41:15.472 --> 41:18.809
Sleep well?

41:18.893 --> 41:22.271
Oh, yeah. Really good.
Lots of sleep.

41:23.772 --> 41:26.817
I'm sorry for waking
you to ask, but I'm curious...

41:26.901 --> 41:28.402
-...obviously.

41:28.485 --> 41:30.237
Yeah. No worries. Yeah.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.742
Yeah, s-- still thinking.

41:34.825 --> 41:36.160
- Still thinking?
Yeah.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.037
Big decision.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.539
Real-- Real life decision.

41:40.623 --> 41:42.958
Yeah.
- So, just...

41:43.042 --> 41:44.960
- Right. Right.
-...thinking away.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.755
Just, this much thinking
could start to get unromantic.

41:47.838 --> 41:49.757
- Yeah. No.
- Just sayin'.

41:50.382 --> 41:51.675
Hey.

41:51.759 --> 41:53.344
- Oh, wow.
- Hey.

41:53.969 --> 41:55.387
Is that the time?

41:55.471 --> 41:56.722
Excuse me?

41:56.805 --> 41:59.683
Oh, just-- just checking
the old watch there.

41:59.767 --> 42:02.019
- Oh.
- I can't believe it, um...

42:02.102 --> 42:03.729
What are you--
What are you up to today?

42:03.812 --> 42:06.482
Um... I don't know. Work shit?

42:06.565 --> 42:07.608
Work?

42:08.400 --> 42:09.652
- Yeah.
- Or--

42:10.152 --> 42:11.695
Okay, because...

42:11.779 --> 42:15.366
I thought, or I've overheard,
actually, that-- that you, uh,

42:15.449 --> 42:16.742
not to-- not to intrude, or--

42:16.825 --> 42:19.578
But-- But I thought
maybe you were part of the...

42:19.662 --> 42:20.704
the whole-- the--

42:20.788 --> 42:22.748
- the titled monarchical, uh...

42:22.831 --> 42:25.000
...sort of situation, if--
if that's not too--

42:25.084 --> 42:26.043
too bold to say?

42:26.126 --> 42:28.587
No, sure,
but I do a bit of, uh--

42:28.671 --> 42:30.631
I'm an online brand ambassador.

42:30.714 --> 42:32.675
A fermented yogurt drink.

42:32.758 --> 42:34.260
Fermented yogurt?

42:34.343 --> 42:36.053
Yeah.
- Well, I've-- I've had that.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.972
Yeah. It's good. It's really g--
It's, uh--

42:38.055 --> 42:39.682
It's a--
It's a gut-cleansing treat.

42:39.765 --> 42:41.100
Really?
- Hey, dipshit? Hands off.

42:41.183 --> 42:42.393
Hi.
- Hey.

42:42.476 --> 42:43.978
I'm just off to save the world.
Should be back for dinner.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.229
- Greg!
Oh!

42:45.312 --> 42:48.107
Would you please keep
the contessa company? Um...

42:48.190 --> 42:50.067
But don't look at her.
Everyone knows
what you're thinking,

42:50.150 --> 42:51.777
and it's disgusting. Bye-ya!

42:52.236 --> 42:53.445
Sorry about him.

42:53.529 --> 42:54.822
Laurie, how the hell are you?

42:54.905 --> 42:55.948
- I'm good.
Yeah!

42:56.031 --> 42:57.199
Good to see you.
Yeah! My cousin!

42:57.283 --> 42:58.951
- A very rude man.

42:59.034 --> 43:00.119
Mm-hmm.

43:00.202 --> 43:02.871
GoJo price has lurched.
And held.

43:04.039 --> 43:05.332
Uh-huh. Power of the tweet.

43:05.416 --> 43:09.920
Yeah. By midweek, their market
cap is gonna be close to ours.

43:10.004 --> 43:12.464
I don't think that Rome can find
a landing zone for this.

43:15.342 --> 43:17.761
- You okay?

43:18.262 --> 43:19.763
Uh-huh.

43:19.847 --> 43:23.017
That was pretty-- pretty
spicy pillow talk last night.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.727
Yeah.

43:25.644 --> 43:28.188
- Yeah. You ready?
Yeah.

43:30.899 --> 43:32.401
Thank you.

43:32.484 --> 43:34.987
But it did, uh--
It got pretty, um...

43:36.447 --> 43:39.074
It got pretty-- You know,
when you-- when you said,

43:39.158 --> 43:41.410
"Say something filthy"

43:41.493 --> 43:42.870
or "Do something dirty."

43:42.953 --> 43:44.163
Mm-hmm?

43:44.246 --> 43:46.540
Yeah. I was just being horrible
for fun, you know, dirty fun.

43:46.623 --> 43:48.751
No, it was--
it was dirty, but...

43:50.252 --> 43:52.880
this morning, you know,
I feel a little, um...

43:55.132 --> 43:56.800
a little afterburn, you know?

43:58.302 --> 43:59.303
Like...

44:00.012 --> 44:01.722
I was thinking...

44:01.805 --> 44:04.224
more like love beads,
or, you know,

44:04.308 --> 44:06.477
- I'd be a sexy fireman, and...
- Oh.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.812
...it was--
kind of got into the realms

44:08.896 --> 44:10.522
of that you don't love me.

44:10.606 --> 44:13.108
Okay. Well,
what happens in Sex Vegas...

44:13.192 --> 44:15.027
Right, right, yeah.

44:15.110 --> 44:17.488
No, I know, but then
sometimes I think, um...

44:18.906 --> 44:20.282
sometimes I think,
"Should I maybe listen

44:20.366 --> 44:23.035
to the things you say
directly in my face

44:23.118 --> 44:24.870
when we're
at our most intimate?"

44:25.871 --> 44:27.539
Tom!

44:27.623 --> 44:29.458
You can't... Oh, my God!

44:29.541 --> 44:31.377
You can't ask someone
to say terrible things

44:31.460 --> 44:32.961
and then get all...

44:33.045 --> 44:34.338
That's a bit manipulative.

44:36.507 --> 44:37.883
Right.
Yeah?

44:39.843 --> 44:41.678
But did you mean it
about the baby?

44:42.221 --> 44:43.222
Yes.

44:43.806 --> 44:44.807
Yeah, I...

44:45.891 --> 44:47.434
Yeah, I think so.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.644
One way or another.

44:49.686 --> 44:51.063
You know,
we should freeze at least.

44:51.146 --> 44:52.231
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:54.441 --> 44:57.945
You know, embryos survive
way better than eggs. So...

44:59.029 --> 45:00.280
we should...

45:01.323 --> 45:03.450
put it together
and then see where we are.

45:06.912 --> 45:11.500
Okay. And-- And when do you--
when do you think that might be?

45:12.751 --> 45:14.253
Well, I don't...

45:14.336 --> 45:15.796
...know, Tom. It--

45:15.879 --> 45:17.840
It's important
that the-- the-- the--

45:17.923 --> 45:19.633
the host chamber is willing.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.054
Well, they keep them
for ten years and then,

45:24.138 --> 45:26.306
you know, you can do what...
...you want,

45:26.390 --> 45:28.142
but it-- it-- it--
it's different if one of us dies

45:28.225 --> 45:29.643
or is in a long-term coma.

45:29.726 --> 45:31.311
- And-- No, it's-- That's what--

45:31.395 --> 45:32.730
It's true, you d--
you decide beforehand

45:32.813 --> 45:34.773
what you would want
to happen, and...

45:34.857 --> 45:36.233
You know, I don't just
automatically get them

45:36.316 --> 45:38.193
if we divorce...
...or something like that,

45:38.277 --> 45:40.988
if that's the thing
that concerns you.

45:41.071 --> 45:42.281
No, I just-- I wo--

45:42.364 --> 45:44.700
I wouldn't have necessarily
thought about all of that.

45:46.368 --> 45:48.620
Oh. Uh-- Well,
I just think it's smart

45:48.704 --> 45:50.664
- to bank some embryos.
- Uh-huh.

45:50.747 --> 45:52.207
And then, you know,
we can see where we are.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.877
So we could be looking at,
like, ten years?

45:54.960 --> 45:56.086
- That's-- That's like--
- Oh, well...

45:56.170 --> 45:59.047
Ten years is like
two-and-a-half Olympics.

45:59.131 --> 46:01.675
Actually, when you put it
like that, it's...

46:01.759 --> 46:03.010
No.

46:03.093 --> 46:05.846
It'll get clearer.
I just think it's a good option.

46:05.929 --> 46:07.764
And then if something
happens or, you know,

46:07.848 --> 46:09.850
you change your mind,
they destroy them,

46:09.933 --> 46:11.268
it doesn't bind you.

46:13.353 --> 46:16.023
I would want you to have
my babies if I died.

46:18.484 --> 46:19.485
Oh.

46:20.777 --> 46:21.778
Oh.

46:23.155 --> 46:24.198
Aw, thank you.

46:24.823 --> 46:25.949
And if you died?

46:27.618 --> 46:28.994
Would I want-- Um...

46:31.830 --> 46:33.207
Yeah, I think so.

46:34.583 --> 46:36.168
- Can I think about it?
- Sure.

46:39.213 --> 46:41.924
You know, Tom...
I do--

46:42.007 --> 46:44.426
I may not love you,
but I do love you.

46:45.928 --> 46:46.887
You know.

46:46.970 --> 46:49.973
I know. I do know.
I do know.

46:50.474 --> 46:51.391
Well...

46:51.475 --> 46:53.602
...baby popsicles.

46:53.685 --> 46:55.270
- Baby...
- Baby popsicles.

46:55.354 --> 46:56.855
Uh-huh.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.190
- Don't fall in!

47:38.897 --> 47:40.065
Nope!

47:40.148 --> 47:41.817
Do you
want me to hold your hand?

47:41.900 --> 47:43.569
Hey!

47:43.652 --> 47:44.820
Come on,
I'll hold your hand.

47:44.903 --> 47:45.946
Piss off!

47:50.576 --> 47:51.618
Amazing place!

47:52.411 --> 47:53.412
Yeah.

47:54.329 --> 47:56.832
No?
- I don't-- I don't know.

47:56.915 --> 47:58.792
It kind of freaks me out,
to be honest.

47:59.626 --> 48:00.961
Oh, yeah?

48:01.044 --> 48:02.629
When I got it,
I wanted everything

48:02.713 --> 48:04.923
to be absolutely perfect.

48:05.007 --> 48:06.967
Now, I'm sleeping
on a camping mat

48:07.050 --> 48:08.552
on the floor
until I get a deep dive

48:08.635 --> 48:10.512
on the best mattress
in the world.

48:11.346 --> 48:12.931
So...

48:13.015 --> 48:16.143
Ah, it's-- it's great.
It's great, but...

48:17.227 --> 48:18.645
I'm just not feeling great.

48:20.731 --> 48:22.357
I mean, I'm f-- I'm fine.

48:24.192 --> 48:26.236
- Well-- But not really.
- Okay.

48:26.320 --> 48:29.948
Maybe let's leave the little
feely-feelings out of it, uh,

48:30.032 --> 48:31.742
'cause I'm gonna
give you nothing.

48:31.825 --> 48:33.368
- All right.
Nothing!

48:33.452 --> 48:36.997
So, you got a view here...

48:37.080 --> 48:38.290
- of the lake.
- Sure.

48:38.373 --> 48:39.708
Water and boats.
- Yeah.

48:39.791 --> 48:41.501
Have a gander.
- Right. A lot of water.

48:44.379 --> 48:46.214
Hey, what are you worst at?

48:46.923 --> 48:48.342
Uh... Me?

48:48.425 --> 48:49.635
- Yeah.
- Worst?

48:49.718 --> 48:51.595
Success doesn't really
interest me anymore.

48:51.678 --> 48:53.555
- It's too easy.
- Uh-huh?

48:53.639 --> 48:54.640
Like...

48:54.723 --> 48:57.225
analysis plus capital
plus execution. It's--

48:57.309 --> 48:59.269
- It's fucking...
Mm-hmm.

48:59.353 --> 49:00.687
Anyone can do that.

49:01.271 --> 49:02.272
But failure...

49:03.398 --> 49:05.275
- Oh.
- That's a secret.

49:05.359 --> 49:07.653
Just as much failure
as possible

49:07.736 --> 49:09.071
as fast as possible...

49:10.530 --> 49:11.740
Just burn that shit out.

49:11.823 --> 49:14.618
- Mm-hmm. Well, I...
- That's interesting.

49:14.701 --> 49:17.746
...am not telling you...

49:17.829 --> 49:20.248
a single one
of my weaknesses, ever.

49:20.332 --> 49:22.000
Ever, ever, ever.

49:22.084 --> 49:24.044
- Never ever.
- That's smart.

49:24.127 --> 49:25.212
I know. I'm smart.

49:25.295 --> 49:26.713
'Cause I ream people.

49:27.422 --> 49:29.091
Juice them like oranges.

49:32.302 --> 49:33.720
No, look, seriously, I...

49:34.596 --> 49:36.682
I get way too into people,
and...

49:38.308 --> 49:39.851
and then, they disappoint me.

49:44.648 --> 49:46.692
Hey, I'm, uh...

49:46.775 --> 49:48.610
I'm thinking of doing like a...

49:48.694 --> 49:51.113
quarterly up-or-outs
at the company.

49:51.196 --> 49:52.572
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

49:52.656 --> 49:56.243
Firing people is like 85%
of why I get up in the morning.

49:58.704 --> 49:59.705
But, uh...

50:00.831 --> 50:03.375
do wanna ask you
about that tweet,

50:03.458 --> 50:04.835
if you don't mind.

50:04.918 --> 50:06.586
Oh, the...

50:06.670 --> 50:08.130
- That one?
Yeah. Seriously. Yes.

50:08.213 --> 50:10.841
You got, like,
big shit coming your way?

50:15.178 --> 50:17.681
Dude...
...are you, uh--

50:17.764 --> 50:20.809
Are you asking me for material
non-public information?

50:20.892 --> 50:21.935
I mean, I don't know.

50:22.018 --> 50:23.603
Were you trying to give
your share price a pop

50:23.687 --> 50:25.188
by tweeting
unverifiable information

50:25.272 --> 50:26.982
outside normal
disclosure channels?

50:27.065 --> 50:30.110
No.
You're not allowed to do that.

50:33.155 --> 50:35.198
- Yup. Yup.
So mean.

50:35.282 --> 50:37.075
The thing
I need to know...

50:37.159 --> 50:40.328
do you want this deal?
Are you into it at all?

50:43.331 --> 50:46.168
- Yeah, I am.
Okay.

50:46.251 --> 50:48.628
I'm just a little Swedish,
you know?

50:48.712 --> 50:51.298
- I'm, uh, into equality.
Okay.

50:51.381 --> 50:53.467
I like getting into bed
with people,

50:53.550 --> 50:55.802
but I also like
sharing it equally.

50:57.262 --> 50:58.889
Okay.

50:58.972 --> 51:01.725
Okay. It's just, um,
I'm heading to Milan

51:01.808 --> 51:03.977
to lock things down
with Dad and the bankers.

51:04.060 --> 51:05.061
And...

51:06.062 --> 51:07.647
the tweet just
didn't feel great.

51:07.731 --> 51:09.733
And if you're hoping to just
blow this whole thing up,

51:09.816 --> 51:11.109
just tell me, okay?

51:14.279 --> 51:16.573
I just wanna get myself
the best of everything.

51:18.658 --> 51:20.202
Okay.

51:20.285 --> 51:22.412
Fuck, yeah. I get that.
Definitely.

52:14.297 --> 52:15.507
- Hey.
Hey!

52:15.590 --> 52:16.466
So?

52:16.550 --> 52:18.593
So, I think it's over.
- What?

52:18.677 --> 52:21.137
Yeah, I don't think Matsson's
interested in getting acquired.

52:21.221 --> 52:24.391
I think he's angling
for a merger of equals.

52:24.474 --> 52:26.685
Okay. Fuck!
- Mm-hmm.

52:26.768 --> 52:29.896
So, it's dead, right?
Well?

52:29.980 --> 52:31.356
- Are you sure?
- Well--

52:31.439 --> 52:34.317
I mean, I don't wanna pile
on the pressure, Roman,

52:34.401 --> 52:36.862
and obviously there are always
multiple ways forward

52:36.945 --> 52:39.072
- and I don't wanna
overcook this, but...
Mm-hmm.

52:39.155 --> 52:41.032
...in terms of deals
that make sense,

52:41.116 --> 52:43.994
if we don't beef up soon,
I think we end up
someone's lunch.

52:44.452 --> 52:45.871
Mm-hmm.

52:45.954 --> 52:47.831
Well, thanks, Ger.

52:47.914 --> 52:50.584
I'm already so stressed
I'm jerking dust.

52:51.835 --> 52:53.628
You want
to tell him together?

52:53.712 --> 52:55.839
I'm not really inside
the details, so...

52:56.464 --> 52:58.508
Okay. Sure.

52:58.592 --> 53:00.260
Well, it was nice
knowing you, then.

53:00.343 --> 53:01.511
Yep.

53:01.595 --> 53:05.432
So, before we get the whole
three-ring circus in here,

53:05.515 --> 53:07.100
just among friends,

53:07.183 --> 53:10.562
I wanna get a sense
of what's going on.

53:11.646 --> 53:14.232
Is he a Twitter panty-flasher?

53:14.316 --> 53:16.067
Or is he a serious person?

53:16.151 --> 53:18.486
Uh-- Well, he is
a serious person.

53:19.195 --> 53:20.238
You're certain?

53:20.322 --> 53:22.240
Yes, Shiv, he is serious.

53:22.908 --> 53:24.826
But, Dad, he, um,

53:24.910 --> 53:28.038
he thinks there's value
that hasn't been priced in yet.

53:28.121 --> 53:30.332
Matsson's gunning
for a merger of equals.

53:30.415 --> 53:32.667
So, I guess, you know,
that probably...

53:34.628 --> 53:37.005
Uh-- Merger of equals?

53:37.088 --> 53:40.300
Yeah. Like, he's got 12
of the prime Asian
sports leagues

53:40.383 --> 53:42.802
signed up for GoJo,
and he's gonna fold it all
into the platform.

53:42.886 --> 53:46.014
Live sports, games, betting.
It's a fucking growth bomb.

53:46.097 --> 53:49.267
Okay, but...
Full 50-50 board, all stock,

53:49.351 --> 53:51.478
Dad, what, splits control?

53:51.561 --> 53:53.146
Yes, Siobhan.

53:53.229 --> 53:54.773
Well, I don't--
- I know.

53:54.856 --> 53:56.650
I don't think-- Dad?

54:01.029 --> 54:02.781
But the guy isn't a fuckhead?

54:03.990 --> 54:06.368
No. The--
The tweeting was a move.

54:06.451 --> 54:09.496
Well, he's not some big baby
who shits for clicks?

54:09.579 --> 54:11.790
No. No. He's a--
He's on the snake.

54:11.873 --> 54:14.751
You know, I know people, Dad.
I'm-- I'm a people-sniffer.

54:14.834 --> 54:16.836
Because I can win any bout
with a boxer fuck,

54:16.920 --> 54:19.005
but I don't know
how to knock out a clown.

54:19.089 --> 54:20.674
He's not a clown.
He's a motherfucker.

54:20.757 --> 54:22.133
It's what you
would have done, right?

54:22.217 --> 54:23.802
He just maximized his leverage.

54:23.885 --> 54:26.137
Yeah, but merger of equals?
Like...

54:26.221 --> 54:28.223
- No such thing.
- Always a top dog, right?

54:28.306 --> 54:31.851
Sure.
And, I mean, he wants the label,

54:31.935 --> 54:34.854
but I think we could still be
the puppy fuckers here!

54:34.938 --> 54:37.315
<i>Uh-- The family stake will be...</i>

54:37.399 --> 54:39.275
<i>-seriously diluted.</i>
- Hmm.

54:39.359 --> 54:42.362
I think he'd let us
craft it so that we keep
balance of the board.

54:42.445 --> 54:45.407
I think he just wants
the freedom and the status.

54:45.490 --> 54:47.242
GoJo Royco.
I mean, who gives a fuck?

54:47.325 --> 54:49.160
Let him have the logo,
we take the wheel.

54:49.244 --> 54:52.956
Yeah, I mean,
it would be real scale.

54:53.039 --> 54:57.711
It's a legitimate way
of staying relevant.

54:57.794 --> 55:00.672
<i>It's a... big upheaval.</i>

55:00.755 --> 55:02.924
Yeah, I mean the top team,
they'll--

55:03.008 --> 55:05.510
You know, you'll be obviously
be fighting for your lives.

55:05.593 --> 55:07.512
But I'm sure
you can trust Dad, guys.

55:07.595 --> 55:08.972
<i>Obviously.</i>

55:09.055 --> 55:11.725
Merger's really
a state of mind, right?

55:11.808 --> 55:15.603
Dad, Gerri, you stay
with your hands on the tiller.

55:15.687 --> 55:17.856
I mean, their--
their price rise? It's real.

55:17.939 --> 55:19.274
It's a proper fucking streamer!

55:19.357 --> 55:21.026
And the future is...

55:21.109 --> 55:24.779
movies, TV, music, games,
sports, eSports,

55:24.863 --> 55:27.532
VR, AR, betting,
fucking everything,

55:27.615 --> 55:30.160
for everyone, and Matsson knows
how to get there.

55:33.955 --> 55:34.956
Logan?

55:35.040 --> 55:37.500
We can't afford
to walk away right now.

55:37.584 --> 55:39.502
Must be worth
a conversation, son.

55:39.586 --> 55:41.755
Uh-huh!
Bring them in!

55:41.838 --> 55:44.507
Let's get the banker fucks
in here on this.

55:45.383 --> 55:46.468
Okay.

55:46.843 --> 55:48.011
Fuckin' A.

55:53.975 --> 55:55.018
Hmm.

56:00.607 --> 56:01.733
Right this way.

56:01.816 --> 56:04.736
This is Tom Wambsgans.
He's the Chairman of ATN News.

56:04.819 --> 56:06.237
Hi.
Hi.

56:06.321 --> 56:08.573
Tom. How are you?
Good.

56:08.656 --> 56:11.451
Shiv Roy, President
of Domestic Operations.

56:11.534 --> 56:12.911
Glad to meet you.
Gerri Kellman.

56:12.994 --> 56:14.537
Sit wherever you're comfortable.

56:48.822 --> 56:49.864
I need five.

56:53.493 --> 56:54.494
Dad?

57:01.918 --> 57:03.545
Uh-- Jesus. Fuck.

57:03.628 --> 57:07.423
Um-- Yeah, that's his dick.
He's...

57:07.507 --> 57:10.677
sent you a picture
of his dick by mistake.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.387
Well, it's pretty obvious.

57:14.055 --> 57:16.766
Uh... Yeah, he meant
to send it to Gerri.

57:19.060 --> 57:21.020
- I don't get it.

57:21.104 --> 57:24.357
Uh-- Well, he--
Honestly, he's, uh, he's--

57:24.440 --> 57:27.318
he's weird about Gerri.

57:27.402 --> 57:29.863
Everyone knows it, and...

57:29.946 --> 57:32.073
and frankly, I think
it's fucking disgusting.

57:32.949 --> 57:34.117
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

57:34.200 --> 57:36.828
Yeah. Yeah, Gerri
is probably just...

57:36.911 --> 57:38.955
not stopping it for leverage.

57:39.038 --> 57:40.498
You know, banking it as ammo.

57:42.083 --> 57:44.127
Isn't he just Roman being Roman?

57:45.628 --> 57:47.839
Uh... No.

57:49.382 --> 57:52.135
No, I mean--
No, I think it's a...

57:53.136 --> 57:54.721
potential problem.

57:54.804 --> 57:55.889
There's issues, you know?

57:55.972 --> 57:57.432
Everyone says that he
used to get jerked off

57:57.515 --> 57:59.100
by his personal trainer.

57:59.184 --> 58:01.019
And now,
there's this Gerri thing.

58:01.102 --> 58:02.562
- It's a...

58:02.645 --> 58:03.730
It's a track record, you know?

58:03.813 --> 58:05.648
So, I think, you know,
moving forward,

58:05.732 --> 58:07.358
- perhaps we should--
- Oh, ho-- Okay. Okay. Okay.

58:07.442 --> 58:10.486
Well, thank you.
Uh... Thank you, Pinkie.

58:10.570 --> 58:12.530
- Uh... Go on.
- Okay.

58:12.614 --> 58:14.616
Roman!
- Jesus, fu...

58:18.578 --> 58:20.371
Hey, put in a good word for you.

58:20.872 --> 58:22.040
Thanks.

58:36.387 --> 58:38.056
Are you a sicko?

58:38.139 --> 58:39.390
- What is this?
- Oh, Jesus.

58:39.474 --> 58:41.643
Why do you send them?
- God, it's just, you know,

58:41.726 --> 58:42.894
it's like...

58:43.519 --> 58:44.729
"Here's my dick."

58:45.647 --> 58:47.941
Oh, what? Like a-- a "fuck you"?

58:48.024 --> 58:50.568
People just send each other
pics of their dicks.

58:50.652 --> 58:52.862
People send each other
pics of their dicks?

58:52.946 --> 58:54.239
Yeah. Have you heard
of dick pics, Dad?

58:54.322 --> 58:57.242
Well, we do publish a number
of popular newspapers,

58:57.325 --> 58:58.743
so yes, son.

58:58.826 --> 59:01.996
Uh... We probably invented
the fucking words.

59:03.414 --> 59:04.582
But why?

59:07.168 --> 59:08.127
Why-- Why? I don't know.

59:08.211 --> 59:10.088
It's just like,
"Here's my dick," I guess.

59:13.424 --> 59:14.759
You got a problem?

59:16.427 --> 59:19.013
What happened to that nice
piece of tail you were with?

59:19.097 --> 59:21.891
Uh... Tabitha?
Yeah, she's amazing.

59:21.975 --> 59:23.393
We're having some issues.

59:23.810 --> 59:25.645
And, um...

59:25.728 --> 59:27.772
What interests you
in Gerri exactly?

59:27.855 --> 59:30.483
Jesus, Dad. I'm fucking--
I'm screwing around!

59:30.566 --> 59:33.861
I don't like things going on
I don't know about.

59:33.945 --> 59:35.863
She's a million years old.

59:35.947 --> 59:37.615
It's fucking disgusting.

59:38.241 --> 59:39.909
You're a laughingstock.

59:40.368 --> 59:41.536
Oh, go on.

59:41.619 --> 59:43.079
Oh, go on, fuck off.

59:43.871 --> 59:45.290
- Um...

59:48.418 --> 59:51.337
So, like,
what happens now?

59:51.421 --> 59:54.716
I don't want her hanging around
like frozen fucking piss.

59:55.758 --> 59:57.593
Gerri?

59:57.677 --> 1:00:01.306
Uh-- I'm not a radical feminist,
Dad, but I think

1:00:01.389 --> 1:00:02.932
perhaps we should not fire her

1:00:03.016 --> 1:00:04.934
for receiving pictures
of my dick.

1:00:07.937 --> 1:00:09.272
Are you gonna come back?

1:00:18.823 --> 1:00:19.949
Sorry about all this, Gerri.

1:00:20.033 --> 1:00:21.451
It's just something
I wanna get...

1:00:21.534 --> 1:00:24.662
...you know, really clear
about what's going on, you know?

1:00:24.746 --> 1:00:26.831
And most importantly,
to see if you're okay.

1:00:26.914 --> 1:00:28.833
Uh-huh.
It's-- It's not a big deal.

1:00:28.916 --> 1:00:30.877
Okay. Yeah, I just wanna get
things clear to--

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:32.128
For my dad, you know?

1:00:32.211 --> 1:00:34.213
God, this must be
so hard for you.

1:00:34.297 --> 1:00:35.840
- It's fine.
- Do you wanna...

1:00:37.425 --> 1:00:39.052
No? Okay.

1:00:39.135 --> 1:00:43.014
Uh-- So, has this or something
like this happened before?

1:00:43.890 --> 1:00:45.183
I can't recall.

1:00:45.266 --> 1:00:50.229
Mm-hmm? And if it did,
uh, did you ask him to stop?

1:00:50.313 --> 1:00:52.815
Let's talk about this,
uh, tomorrow, okay?

1:00:52.899 --> 1:00:54.609
Uh-- I just need to check in
with some people.

1:00:54.692 --> 1:00:56.444
Okay. Well, sure.
I mean, it's not...

1:00:57.403 --> 1:00:59.697
not as if you were
welcoming these,

1:00:59.781 --> 1:01:01.449
- uh, items.

1:01:01.532 --> 1:01:02.784
Were you, Gerri?

1:01:02.867 --> 1:01:04.702
Shiv.

1:01:04.786 --> 1:01:05.953
Look, it's just something
for your well-being

1:01:06.037 --> 1:01:08.206
we need to get
really clear about, because...

1:01:08.706 --> 1:01:09.707
you know.

1:01:09.791 --> 1:01:11.000
With all this potential
upheaval,

1:01:11.084 --> 1:01:13.586
and you being in such a delicate
position as interim CEO,

1:01:13.669 --> 1:01:15.588
if you can't deal with your own
sexual harassment,

1:01:15.671 --> 1:01:16.964
then it's not a good look.

1:01:17.673 --> 1:01:19.384
I can cope.

1:01:19.467 --> 1:01:21.260
Okay. So, do you wanna
make a formal complaint

1:01:21.344 --> 1:01:22.762
against him regarding this?

1:01:22.845 --> 1:01:24.764
Well, that's for me to decide.

1:01:24.847 --> 1:01:26.766
Mm-hmm. I just think,
Gerri, that...

1:01:26.849 --> 1:01:29.811
you should report him to HR,
because if you don't,

1:01:29.894 --> 1:01:32.980
it could be argued that you
welcomed these photos...

1:01:33.064 --> 1:01:34.857
and that just undermines
your position.

1:01:34.941 --> 1:01:37.902
It's just-- That's my concern
for you here.

1:01:37.985 --> 1:01:40.738
I wonder if we shouldn't
just kick this
all the way up to the board.

1:01:42.824 --> 1:01:45.159
Well, thank you for giving this
so much thought,

1:01:45.243 --> 1:01:47.995
and, uh,
I'll think it over, okay?

1:01:48.079 --> 1:01:50.706
- So, I'll see you back inside.
- Mm-hmm. Let me know.

1:02:32.957 --> 1:02:35.835
Hey, Dad? I think I'm gonna
head inside with Soph.

1:02:35.918 --> 1:02:37.044
Okay, buddy.
