Please don't think

that we reconnected?

20:04.871 --> 20:08.372

It's that you didn't
tell me that she does.

20:08.474 --> 20:11.742
- Please. She just wants
a relationship with me, OK?

20:11.844 --> 20:14.645

about herself, more about me.

in the last 10 years.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.906
When I first met her,
she was, uh,

37:23.008 --> 37:25.075
hard, kind of tough.

37:25.177 --> 37:27.143
She'd anger really easily.

37:27.246 --> 37:29.379
You couldn't really get
through those walls, but...

37:29.481 --> 37:32.148
Trevor brought
the best out in her.

37:32.251 --> 37:35.418
- Amy thinks Sara could have had
something to do with it.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.654
She told me at the funeral.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.657
- Well, Amy, uh,

37:40.759 --> 37:42.859
never really liked
or accepted Sara, so you're

37:42.961 --> 37:45.228
gonna have to take what she says
with a grain of salt.

37:47.232 --> 37:48.898
- Sara said that you and Trevor

37:49.001 --> 37:50.800
were involved
in an investigation.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.969
Do you know anything
about that?

37:53.071 --> 37:55.071
(ominous music)
- What makes her think that?

37:55.173 --> 37:58.875
- I don't know. Overheard Trevor
talking about it, I guess.

38:00.846 --> 38:02.545
- No. Uh...

38:02.648 --> 38:06.449
yeah, we have clients, but
nothing ever happened with them.

38:06.551 --> 38:08.685
- What about other clients.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.755
Sara said that Trevor
could be ruthless at times.

38:13.191 --> 38:15.725
- Well, she's right
about that.

38:15.827 --> 38:18.728
You never wanted
to get on Trevor's bad side.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.534
you're
jumping to conclusions.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.604
- Mom! OK, think about it
like this.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.007
Someone tries to rob Trevor
after leaving a restaurant -

38:31.109 --> 38:32.842
not successfully but still -

38:32.944 --> 38:35.879
and then someone almost breaks
into Michael's apartment,

38:35.981 --> 38:38.948
And then Trevor's murdered
in his own home, but they don't

38:39.051 --> 38:41.418
do anything to Sara.
I mean, if that doesn't sound

38:41.520 --> 38:43.386
like a hit,
I have no idea what does.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.456
- Yeah, but aren't the police
looking into all this?

38:46.558 --> 38:48.858

You hired a private

There's a lot

with you, I was an escort,

49:13.418 --> 49:17.420

49:27.799 --> 49:29.665
and I just figured...

49:29.767 --> 49:31.400
I figured if you knew
any of that,

49:31.502 --> 49:33.369
you would have walked away
and never contacted me again.

49:33.471 --> 49:36.439
- So you basically made up
a person that didn't exist.

49:36.541 --> 49:40.676
- No. I let you into my life
the way it is now.

49:40.745 --> 49:42.812
I went to rehab
and I met a guy there,

49:42.914 --> 49:44.847
and he helped me
turn my life around.

49:44.949 --> 49:47.650
And a year later,
I met Trevor.

49:47.752 --> 49:51.020
- That is such a load of crap!
- Hey, you know what?

49:51.122 --> 49:52.822

49:56.060 --> 49:58.394
You wanna know
the truth about me?

49:58.496 --> 50:00.930
I'll tell you the truth.

50:01.032 --> 50:03.699

50:03.801 --> 50:05.534

50:05.636 --> 50:07.737

that was given to me.

50:07.839 --> 50:09.705
I drank a lot and I did

50:09.807 --> 50:12.041
a lot of drugs.

50:12.143 --> 50:14.643
But you know what?

50:14.746 --> 50:16.379
I am not that person anymore.

50:16.481 --> 50:20.883
I am a completely
different person.

50:23.921 --> 50:26.022

50:26.124 --> 50:29.558
I need you to be honest
with me, for once.

50:29.660 --> 50:32.862
Did you kill Trevor?

50:34.465 --> 50:35.731
- No.

50:35.833 --> 50:38.367
- Then why would you throw away
a nightgown with blood on it?

50:38.469 --> 50:40.603
- I don't know! I didn't!

50:40.705 --> 50:41.904
I didn't!

50:42.006 --> 50:43.973

the house at night!

I'm not so sure anymore.

And just lied

52:22.006 --> 52:24.673

gonna sound crazy,

Someone's trying to frame her.

- Why would you say that?
- The knife they found,

52:35.052 --> 52:38.053
it was in a hidden cupboard.
- OK...

52:38.156 --> 52:40.623
- I don't think that Sara even
knows that cupboard exists.

52:40.725 --> 52:42.591
But more importantly,

52:42.693 --> 52:44.360
the knife was not there
two days ago.

52:44.462 --> 52:47.163
- And how do you know this?

52:47.265 --> 52:49.565

up there at the same time,

52:51.736 --> 52:54.270

52:54.372 --> 52:57.039

the following day.

52:57.141 --> 52:59.808
- Why were you
looking in there?

52:59.911 --> 53:01.710
- I was looking for something

53:01.812 --> 53:03.812
that my dad would have wanted
to keep hidden from Sara:

53:03.915 --> 53:06.448
threatening letters,
legal papers,

53:06.551 --> 53:08.617
I don't know.

53:08.719 --> 53:10.686
My dad used to hide gifts
for my mom there

53:10.788 --> 53:12.488
when she was still alive.

53:12.590 --> 53:14.857
I didn't really expect
to find anything but I...

53:14.959 --> 53:16.692
I figured it was
worth a shot.

53:16.794 --> 53:19.828
- And is there anyone else
who knows about it?
- Not sure,

53:19.931 --> 53:22.865
but the killer obviously knew
the layout of the house.

53:22.967 --> 53:24.934
- Amy, you have to go
to the police with this.

53:25.036 --> 53:26.435
- I don't know
how receptive they'll be.

53:26.537 --> 53:28.537
They think they have
their person.

53:28.639 --> 53:33.275
We need something concrete.
- OK. Let's start by making

53:33.377 --> 53:35.544
a list of everyone that went
in and out of the house.

53:36.981 --> 53:40.416
- The housekeeper, she wouldn't
have anything to do with this.

53:40.518 --> 53:42.685
The police,
although I don't know

53:42.787 --> 53:44.787
why they would want
to frame your mother.

53:44.889 --> 53:45.754
- Michael?

53:45.856 --> 53:48.023
- Possibly.

53:48.125 --> 53:50.993
He did use to house sit for them
from time to time.

53:51.095 --> 53:52.962
- You...

53:54.031 --> 53:55.764
- You think I could have
killed my father?!

53:55.866 --> 53:58.934
- No. I'm just saying
you had access.
- I loved my father!

53:59.036 --> 54:00.869
He wasn't always
a good person,

54:00.972 --> 54:03.305
but he was always good to me
and he did not deserve

54:03.407 --> 54:05.908
what happened to him! Look,

54:06.010 --> 54:08.644
I know it's no secret
that I don't like Sara,

54:08.746 --> 54:10.946
but I do not wanna see

54:11.048 --> 54:12.848
an innocent person
go to prison

54:12.950 --> 54:15.851
while the person who murdered
my father is still out there!

54:17.888 --> 54:20.389

needs to pay.

54:20.491 --> 54:24.093
- I'm sorry.
I-I believe you. I...

54:24.195 --> 54:26.395

that you do.

54:26.497 --> 54:28.831

54:28.933 --> 54:30.699
- There is another possibility.

54:30.801 --> 54:32.201
- Who?

54:32.303 --> 54:34.770
- I'm pretty sure my father
was having an affair.

54:34.872 --> 54:37.439
I don't know who it was with,

54:37.541 --> 54:39.742
but one day we were
at a restaurant,

54:39.844 --> 54:42.244
and he got a text from her
while he was in the restroom.

54:42.346 --> 54:45.547
I saw it come up
on his phone.

54:45.650 --> 54:47.950
- So maybe her husband found out

54:48.052 --> 54:51.553
or Trevor broke it off with her
and she got jealous?

54:51.656 --> 54:53.922
- It's worth looking into.

54:55.359 --> 54:57.493
- How do we start?

54:59.463 --> 55:01.463
So, basically, we're looking

55:01.565 --> 55:03.232
for any hotel receipts

55:03.334 --> 55:06.001
or any restaurant receipts
where two people ate.

a million of them, but yes.

55:11.976 --> 55:13.809

they were pretty close.

- Given that Kelsie
was cheating on Michael,

55:16.247 --> 55:18.347
I doubt my dad would have
been likely to tell Michael

55:18.449 --> 55:20.449
he was doing
the same thing to Sara.

1:01:30.754 --> 1:01:32.888
One of the first reasons
I started seeing him alone

1:01:32.990 --> 1:01:34.523
was to get advice
on how to deal with his brother.

1:01:34.625 --> 1:01:37.159
- How could you come
between two brothers like that?

1:01:37.261 --> 1:01:39.594
Dad and Michael were so close.

Michael despised Trevor.

1:01:42.933 --> 1:01:46.301
Trevor brought him down
every chance he got,

1:01:46.403 --> 1:01:49.004

No. I've caused Michael

But if the police find evidence

it won't be because of me.

against my husband!

She refuses to go to the police.

Besides, what he said

that Sara is innocent and if
they keep digging around--

1:05:23.353 --> 1:05:25.987

That she thinks
Michael hired someone

1:06:38.028 --> 1:06:41.596

were sleeping together?

1:06:41.698 --> 1:06:43.465

1:06:50.307 --> 1:06:53.174
obviously Michael is
trying to frame you.

1:06:53.276 --> 1:06:56.111
We think that if we can
go to the police

1:06:56.213 --> 1:06:58.413
with proof of the affair,
then maybe they can

1:06:58.515 --> 1:07:01.116
convince Kelsie to talk.
- Or at the very least,

1:07:01.218 --> 1:07:03.218
just dig a little deeper
into his finances

1:07:03.320 --> 1:07:05.120
and see if he could have
hired someone.

1:07:05.222 --> 1:07:07.722
- I always wondered
if Trevor was being unfaithful.

1:07:10.127 --> 1:07:12.027
I used to call his hotel room
late at night

1:07:12.129 --> 1:07:14.129
and he wouldn't
pick up the phone.

1:07:14.231 --> 1:07:15.930
He always made it seem

1:07:16.033 --> 1:07:18.199
like the pills
were making me paranoid.

1:07:18.301 --> 1:07:21.302
Makes sense it was Kelsie.

1:07:21.405 --> 1:07:24.506
- Is there anything
you can think that could help us

1:07:24.608 --> 1:07:26.474
prove to the cops that they were
sleeping together?

1:07:26.576 --> 1:07:29.177
- No.

1:07:29.279 --> 1:07:31.146
I think he was
quite successful

1:07:31.248 --> 1:07:33.615
at hiding his affair.
- Maybe going

1:07:33.717 --> 1:07:37.519
through Dad's credit cards
could yield something:

1:07:37.621 --> 1:07:41.356
hotel stays, gifts.
- Listen to me.

1:07:41.458 --> 1:07:44.459

1:07:44.561 --> 1:07:46.928

1:12:28.812 --> 1:12:30.778
on the loan.
- Remember when she said

1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:33.614
Michael would disappear for days
at a time. Maybe this is

1:12:33.717 --> 1:12:35.950

- Did your dad know about it?

1:12:36.052 --> 1:12:38.753
- I doubt it.
He would have mentioned it.

1:12:38.855 --> 1:12:40.688

of the murder,

1:12:42.759 --> 1:12:44.625
