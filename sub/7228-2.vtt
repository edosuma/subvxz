there is someone I owe
a good show to.

Hey, Doc, I'm done with dinner,

the world famous

win another race.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.081
Donny, we haven't even started.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.083
How do you know
Ricardo's going to win?

12:31.625 --> 12:33.919
Because he's the best
race car ever.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.504
And he always wins.

12:35.588 --> 12:41.177
I raced him at least
a bajillion times last night,
and he never lost, ever.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.220
After he beats your car,

12:43.304 --> 12:47.600
he's gonna be ready
for the championship
Best Race Car Ever race.

12:47.683 --> 12:50.978
What's the championship

12:51.061 --> 12:53.898
Luca's coming over
with his fastest race car,

12:53.981 --> 12:55.441
and they're gonna
race each other.

12:55.816 --> 12:59.737
But I'm not worried,
'cause Ricardo
is totally gonna win.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.697
Let's get
this race going.

13:01.780 --> 13:04.200
Okay. Just remember...

I know, I know.

"Be prepared to lose."

before Ricardo
wins the race!

Come on! You can do it.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.072
[Donny]
Whoa! Wait! What's wrong?

13:43.739 --> 13:46.534
The great Ricardo Racecar
is slowing down.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.702
He's losing.

13:49.620 --> 13:53.082
Okay, Donny, stop kidding around
and just pass me already.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.708
I'm not kidding.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.002
He won't go any faster.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.129
You won?

13:59.588 --> 14:02.508
That's just--
That's just not possible.

14:02.925 --> 14:06.053
Oh, I'm sorry, Donny.
I didn't mean to win.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.722
Just forget this race
ever happened.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.183
I can't forget it.
You won.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.352
Let's race again.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.647
No. I'm never gonna
race again.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.733
Hey, gang, what's
going on out here?

14:19.817 --> 14:22.611
It's Ricardo.
He lost the race.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.656
Donny, I'm sure there's just
something wrong with him.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.324
Why don't I see
if I can fix it?

14:27.408 --> 14:30.327
Good idea, Doc.
And while you're doing that,

14:30.411 --> 14:34.915
I think today might be
one of those days
that Donny needs a little nap.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.834
I'm not tired!

14:37.376 --> 14:40.296
Donny, you stayed
up late last night
racing your cars.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.047
I don't think you
got enough sleep.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.300
This way to Sleepytown.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.926
But, Dad!

14:46.010 --> 14:49.013
If you get some sleep now,
it'll recharge your batteries,

14:49.096 --> 14:51.557
and you'll have much more energy
when Luca gets here.

14:51.640 --> 14:55.102
And don't worry.
I'll fix Ricardo
before the big race.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.197
[revving]

15:08.365 --> 15:11.702
I'd know that vroom anywhere.
Where is he?

15:11.785 --> 15:13.746
Where's Ricardo Racecar?

15:13.829 --> 15:15.122
[chuckling]
Stuffy!

15:15.497 --> 15:16.707
Sorry, Doc, but...

15:16.790 --> 15:21.003
Do you know
that you are holding
Ricardo Racecar?

15:21.086 --> 15:23.672
[laughing]
Of course I do, Stuffy.

15:24.214 --> 15:29.762
Hello! Ricardo, just wanted
to say I'm a big fan.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.805
A big, big fan!

15:31.889 --> 15:34.558
And, uh, who are you again?

15:34.642 --> 15:38.854
Oh, I'm Stuffy
the dragon! Roar!

15:39.438 --> 15:41.732
We met last week
in the toy box.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.612
It's okay if you
don't remember.

15:46.695 --> 15:47.821
After all,

15:47.905 --> 15:49.949
you're the greatest
race car there is.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.701
[laughing] This is true. I am.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.912
So why am I being carried?

15:54.995 --> 15:58.040
Ricardo, you haven't
been going as fast as usual.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.209
I'm worried something
might be wrong with you.

16:00.292 --> 16:05.172
Doc, I only go one speed--
the fastest.
[motor revs]

16:05.464 --> 16:07.341
But what about the race?

16:07.424 --> 16:08.884
So I lost a race.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.552
It was obviously
a mistake.

and I'll show you that
I still have plenty of zip.

Great. And I can observe
what's happening to you.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.484
You were right.
I, uh, I can't go on.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.153
I have no more to give.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.824
Whatever's wrong with you,
it seems to be
getting worse.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.909
I think I know the problem.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.620
Donny always
cheers for me.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.956
Maybe Ricardo Racecar needs

someone cheering
to make me go fast.

Oh! I'll do it! Can I do it?

when even a great champion

for Ricardo Racecar
to hang up his tires

and then we're gonna
make it better.

why you would have slowed down?

No, I cannot.

I have been racing
well all week.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.277

a look at your engine?

19:13.360 --> 19:14.820

is wearing you out.

What's it, Doc?

Ricardo, you raced,
like, a bajillion times
last night, right?

19:47.311 --> 19:49.980
Yes. A bajillion. Exactly.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.649
And when was the last time
you recharged?

19:53.066 --> 19:54.735

Oh. I don't remember.

this morning.

20:15.964 --> 20:19.092
Oh, my! What is it, Doc?

20:19.468 --> 20:22.137
It's when you don't have
any vroom, or energy.

[Ricardo] No-vroom-vroom-atosis?

20:23.847 --> 20:25.349
Can I win a race with that?

20:25.432 --> 20:27.851
No. But after you recharge,

20:27.935 --> 20:30.145
you'll have plenty
of energy to race.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.315
I am so happy.
I could kiss you.

Hey, Dad.
Shh, shh, shh.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.490
Your brother's
still sleeping.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.534
Oh. Okay. Could you plug
Ricardo in for me?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.912
I think he wasn't working
because he was run-down.

20:46.995 --> 20:48.455
So he needs to recharge.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.123
Sure thing, sweetie.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.173
-[beep]
-There you go, kiddo.

20:58.465 --> 20:59.466
Thanks, Dad.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.011
Ahh. Vroom,
vroom, vroom.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.054
[snores]

21:04.137 --> 21:06.807
I am so fast. Eat my dust.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.016
[Doc chuckles]

21:08.558 --> 21:10.686
I guess recharging
really is like napping.

means Ricardo's all recharged.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.777
Ooh! Ho, ho! Wow!
[motor revs]

22:00.861 --> 22:02.487
Oh, I feel great.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.823
I have so much energy.

22:04.906 --> 22:05.991
I'll be the judge of that.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.577
Let's hear that engine.
[motor revs loudly]

22:08.660 --> 22:10.412
Waah! Aah!
[laughs]

22:10.495 --> 22:12.706
[mechanical heartbeat]

22:12.998 --> 22:16.126
You sound all better.
Now let's see how you drive.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.463
Why don't you take a really fast
lap around the room for me?

22:19.546 --> 22:22.215
Hah! I thought you'd never ask.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.092
[Lambie] Whoa!

22:24.468 --> 22:26.511
That's one fast car.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.727
Do you see?
Do you see how fast I am?

22:33.810 --> 22:36.104
Now I can race for Donny!

22:36.188 --> 22:37.439
[door opens]

22:37.522 --> 22:39.232
Toys, go stuffed!

22:39.983 --> 22:41.526
Doc, how is he?

22:41.818 --> 22:44.279
Luca's gonna have
a pretty tough race.

22:44.362 --> 22:46.698
You haven't seen Mario.
He's fast.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.326
Awesome! Thanks, Doc!

22:50.285 --> 22:52.996
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:53.080 --> 22:56.958

22:57.250 --> 22:58.919
And go!

23:00.212 --> 23:01.254
Go, Mario!
Go! Go...

23:01.338 --> 23:02.798
[Donny] Go! Go!
[Luca] You can do it!

23:02.881 --> 23:04.049
[Donny] Come on!
You can beat him!

23:04.132 --> 23:06.009
[Luca]
You're the best race car ever!

23:06.676 --> 23:08.595
Go, Ricardo! Go!

23:12.641 --> 23:14.267
They're coming
to the loop-de-loop.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.107
Ricardo wins!

23:20.190 --> 23:22.317
All right! Whoo!

23:22.400 --> 23:23.819
Oh! That was awesome!

23:23.902 --> 23:25.237
Best race car ever!

23:25.320 --> 23:26.613
That was a good race,

23:26.696 --> 23:28.657
but I don't remember
your car being that fast.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.618
[laughing] You win again, Doc.

23:32.869 --> 23:34.830
Hey, everybody, it's Doc here.
