WEBVTT

00:07.832 --> 00:10.402
Anyone watching thinking we know fuck all

00:10.506 --> 00:14.119
about knowing fuck all about owt needs to watch their backs--

00:14.223 --> 00:15.335
oof!

00:15.440 --> 00:17.628
So you've had your Labour reclassifying skunk,

00:17.733 --> 00:22.005
sending prices sky high, literally-- literally-- taking

00:22.109 --> 00:24.126
the grass from it's own roots.

00:24.229 --> 00:26.696
Now you've got your condemnation.

00:26.801 --> 00:30.622
Liberals noshing Tories like altar boys picking dimps up.

00:30.727 --> 00:34.548
Have we had a national fucking stroke, or what?

00:34.653 --> 00:38.613
Is revolution a word, or was it never?

00:38.717 --> 00:42.331
Anybody watching needs to know we cope better than average

00:42.435 --> 00:44.589
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:44.693 --> 00:48.271
Well, for fuck's sake, we live in Manchester,

00:48.377 --> 00:51.225
and they charge us for water!

00:51.330 --> 00:56.193
I wandered lonely as a cloud, necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:56.298 --> 01:00.397
This green and pleasant land in ancient times--

01:00.502 --> 01:02.864
yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak!

01:02.969 --> 01:06.234
It's not theirs anymore.

01:06.338 --> 01:09.118
This is our England now.

01:09.222 --> 01:10.230
Party!

01:17.143 --> 01:19.263
FRANK (VOICEOVER): You're always aware of when you're doing

01:19.367 --> 01:20.895
something for the first time.

01:27.602 --> 01:30.623
Swim a length, ride a bike, hit the ball

01:30.729 --> 01:32.152
without shutting your eyes.

01:39.239 --> 01:46.709
Drink a man-sized pint, stick your neck out for a mate.

01:52.929 --> 01:54.318
Smoke a cigarette.

02:00.537 --> 02:05.575
Dream of a woman, other than your wife.

02:05.679 --> 02:09.084
Pop your cherry, get pissed, get high,

02:09.187 --> 02:10.786
get sucked off in chemistry class

02:10.889 --> 02:12.871
by Mrs. O'Neil, who's sworn to secrecy.

02:19.784 --> 02:23.364
But you are never aware of the moment when you're doing

02:23.468 --> 02:25.483
something for the last time.

02:28.923 --> 02:29.756
Last meal.

02:35.142 --> 02:35.975
Last fuck.

02:40.735 --> 02:41.673
Last fight.

02:46.294 --> 02:47.406
Last breath.

02:54.076 --> 02:56.057
Sneaks up on you.

02:56.161 --> 02:56.994
You just never know.

03:04.465 --> 03:07.174
DOMINIC: I might not be around for a few days.

03:07.279 --> 03:08.912
You don't have to answer to me.

03:09.016 --> 03:10.545
Yeah, I know that.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.664
Well, it's a big job.

03:12.768 --> 03:15.200
I want you to know these things, that's all.

03:15.304 --> 03:16.972
Keep talking, I'm listening.

03:17.076 --> 03:19.855
50 feet underground.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.358
I'll pick up the shopping on the way back home from Mass.

03:25.485 --> 03:27.221
I know where they are Dominic.

03:27.325 --> 03:28.159
What?

03:31.252 --> 03:33.093
I think I know where they are, I think.

03:33.197 --> 03:34.552
You think?

03:34.655 --> 03:35.837
Well you better think harder, Gloria, because it's

03:35.942 --> 03:38.339
five days since he's been gone.

03:38.443 --> 03:40.459
He told me after we'd--

03:40.563 --> 03:42.403
I wasn't really listening.

03:42.508 --> 03:45.948
Oh, had you all going, did he?

03:46.052 --> 03:48.693
The opposite.

03:48.797 --> 03:49.769
I was pissed off with him.

03:49.873 --> 03:50.846
DOMINIC: Why?

03:50.950 --> 03:51.992
Because I could.

03:52.097 --> 03:53.244
No, why have you waited till now?

03:53.349 --> 03:55.016
Well what do you want me to say, eh?

03:55.120 --> 03:57.587
Oh, by the way, Karen, Jamie did mention where he was going

03:57.692 --> 04:00.609
after we had a fuck, but I can't quite remember all the details.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.786
So where did you fuck him?

04:05.890 --> 04:06.966
That's disgusting.

04:07.072 --> 04:09.503
Gloria, listen, retrace your steps, all right?

04:09.607 --> 04:12.283
Just think about it, it might just jog your memory.

04:12.387 --> 04:13.708
[rat squeaking]

04:13.812 --> 04:15.897
Leave it.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.606
That's the third time I've seen it this hour.

04:18.709 --> 04:20.793
It's getting more confident.

04:20.899 --> 04:23.331
Let it think we're not bothered, and when it least expects it,

04:23.436 --> 04:25.000
I'll jump the little fucker, eh?

04:25.104 --> 04:27.501
Give it a chance to fatten up then, eh?

04:27.605 --> 04:30.175
Best we keep that as long as we can.

04:30.279 --> 04:31.149
Once it's gone, it's gone.

04:31.253 --> 04:32.191
Rather have my share now.

04:32.295 --> 04:33.129
No.

04:33.234 --> 04:34.554
Please.

04:34.657 --> 04:35.527
Fuck me.

04:35.631 --> 04:37.890
No need, Jamie.

04:37.993 --> 04:39.383
You'll thank me for it later.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.883
I'm dying of thirst and I'm fucking starving in here.

04:41.988 --> 04:43.065
Yeah, we all are.

04:43.170 --> 04:44.525
I could eat a scabby horse.

04:44.628 --> 04:46.505
I could eat Frank.

04:46.609 --> 04:48.208
[frank laughs]

04:50.883 --> 04:54.566
Take one prime beef Mancunian, marinate it

04:54.669 --> 04:59.081
overnight with human detritus, then

04:59.186 --> 05:02.174
roast gently over a low light for about, what,

05:02.278 --> 05:09.157
five fucking days until fucking dead?

05:09.261 --> 05:12.423
Oh, there's not much on these bones, you know.

05:12.527 --> 05:14.091
You'd be much better off with Ruby.

05:14.195 --> 05:16.488
She'll taste a lot sweeter.

05:16.592 --> 05:20.033
Not if you value your testicles.

05:20.137 --> 05:21.838
Frank.

05:21.943 --> 05:26.424
It's the only way I can keep the old love plums cool.

05:26.529 --> 05:30.420
Avert your eyes if you're offended.

05:30.525 --> 05:35.875
Oh, I just need something to take me mind off the heat,

05:35.979 --> 05:37.055
if I can do it.

05:43.518 --> 05:44.699
Every last detail.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.583
I mean, give yourself time to remember.

05:47.688 --> 05:49.494
What music you were listening to, what you were doing,

05:49.598 --> 05:51.370
don't leave nothing out.

05:51.474 --> 05:52.691
Are you sure?

05:52.795 --> 05:55.957
Gloria, Gloria, five days they've been gone.

05:56.061 --> 05:57.520
[MUSIC - JOURNEY, "DON'T STOP BELIEVIN'"]

05:57.624 --> 05:58.910
His guilty pleasure.

05:59.013 --> 06:02.210
He's a big Journey fan.

06:02.315 --> 06:07.631
So started out in missionary then--

06:10.514 --> 06:11.695
Doggy style.

06:15.587 --> 06:16.767
Self-explanatory.

06:20.763 --> 06:21.771
What's that?

06:21.874 --> 06:22.917
Finger job.

06:27.817 --> 06:30.839
Reverse cowgirl.

06:30.943 --> 06:33.966
And then back to missionary.

06:34.069 --> 06:37.370
So he's quite an athletic lad?

06:37.475 --> 06:41.956
Shot his load, started to get dressed.

06:42.060 --> 06:43.277
JAMIE: Well, it's a big job.

06:43.381 --> 06:45.118
Want you to know these things, that's all.

06:45.223 --> 06:48.836
And that's when he said--

06:48.940 --> 06:51.024
said something about a job.

06:51.129 --> 06:52.553
Scratchcards?

06:52.657 --> 06:55.228
Cabinet War Rooms, converted for secure storage.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.374
It's full of them.

06:56.478 --> 06:57.487
And how come you know about it?

06:57.591 --> 06:58.807
Your Jamie told me.

06:58.911 --> 06:59.954
When?

07:00.058 --> 07:01.690
When was it?

07:01.794 --> 07:03.046
I think it was Friday.

07:03.150 --> 07:03.880
Does it matter?

07:03.983 --> 07:05.339
Yes, it fucking matters.

07:05.443 --> 07:08.013
He's told a fucking stranger and not his wife.

07:08.118 --> 07:09.333
Well, at least we know where they are.

07:09.438 --> 07:10.723
And why have you just remembered now?

07:10.828 --> 07:11.974
[sighing] - Come on, Karen.

07:12.078 --> 07:14.024
I was bladdered.

07:14.128 --> 07:15.275
Something must have gone wrong.

07:15.379 --> 07:17.046
Oh, Poirot has nothing on you.

07:17.151 --> 07:19.374
Well, how the fuck are we going to find them?

07:19.479 --> 07:21.077
A needle in a haystack!

07:21.181 --> 07:22.641
Retrace the footsteps.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.969
I better give them a hand.

07:25.073 --> 07:27.783
20 quid says Frank doesn't make it back.

07:27.886 --> 07:30.354
I'll give you three to one.

07:30.458 --> 07:31.395
Will you fucking leave that?

07:31.500 --> 07:32.508
It was bricked up.

07:32.612 --> 07:34.556
I'll do what I want.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.156
Saw this documentary once.

07:36.259 --> 07:42.827
It takes 14 days to die from dehydration and starvation.

07:42.931 --> 07:44.632
How long have we been here now?

07:44.737 --> 07:45.884
Five.

07:45.988 --> 07:47.795
- Three. - Four.

07:47.898 --> 07:48.802
That's a fact.

07:48.907 --> 07:52.694
Yeah, skin cracks, lips and tongue.

07:52.798 --> 07:55.543
Stomach lining drying out makes you vomit.

07:55.646 --> 07:59.675
Nose bleeds, seizures, organs shrink.

07:59.780 --> 08:03.602
This really isn't helping.

08:03.707 --> 08:04.644
Here you are.

08:04.748 --> 08:05.965
Get some of that down you, lad.

08:06.070 --> 08:09.647
I'd rather have the nosebleeds and seizures.

08:09.752 --> 08:10.587
Ruby?

08:14.478 --> 08:15.346
JAMIE: Oi, scrote!

08:15.450 --> 08:16.284
Pack it in!

08:16.388 --> 08:18.507
Shut up!

08:18.611 --> 08:20.800
It's hollow.

08:20.904 --> 08:22.781
This fucking vent, it's hollow behind the bricks.

08:22.884 --> 08:23.893
SHANE: Here, mind out.

08:31.848 --> 08:32.717
Do you mind?

08:36.400 --> 08:37.581
Nothing.

08:37.686 --> 08:39.909
Oh, why is it men never change the sheets?

08:40.014 --> 08:42.131
It's like sleeping in a fucking jockstrap.

08:42.236 --> 08:43.870
There's got to be something.

08:43.972 --> 08:45.606
We need to get into his head.

08:45.711 --> 08:47.379
Billy, think like Shane.

08:50.436 --> 08:51.687
[sobbing]

08:51.790 --> 08:54.988
(IMITATING SHANE) Kelly, please don't leave me, Kelly.

08:55.091 --> 08:57.836
I love you.

08:57.940 --> 09:00.789
Look, what is it exactly we're looking for here?

09:00.893 --> 09:04.611
Clues, pictures, anything that can help us retrace the steps.

09:08.641 --> 09:11.247
What about this?

09:11.351 --> 09:12.464
KAREN: What the fuck?

09:12.568 --> 09:14.374
BILLY: It's a schematic of the lottery building.

09:17.049 --> 09:18.648
There's posters all over the wall.

09:18.752 --> 09:23.060
He's told your brother, but he's not told his wife.

09:23.165 --> 09:25.006
[door opens then slams shut]

09:27.924 --> 09:33.344
It's a gas escape for another sewage channel or summat.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.629
Fucking rank!

09:34.733 --> 09:36.471
It gets narrower the further you get in.

09:36.575 --> 09:37.652
Oh, fuck's sake.

09:37.756 --> 09:38.729
Do you think you'd fit in there?

09:38.834 --> 09:40.118
No.

09:40.224 --> 09:41.578
But funny enough, it's about your fucking size.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.593
If I thought I'd fit, I wouldn't hesitate.

09:43.697 --> 09:44.669
Oh, yeah?

09:44.775 --> 09:46.337
Someone's gotta go in there.

09:46.442 --> 09:49.326
We don't know where it goes, if it goes anywhere at all.

09:49.430 --> 09:50.473
Shimmy back the way.

09:50.577 --> 09:52.557
It's a-- it's a maze of fucking

09:52.662 --> 09:54.851
tunnels and vents and pipes.

09:54.955 --> 09:57.246
Nobody knows where half of it goes.

09:57.351 --> 09:58.880
Well, someone does.

09:58.984 --> 10:01.381
Yes, but he's conspicuous by his fucking absence, isn't it?

10:01.486 --> 10:03.327
So we just stay down here fucking permanently, do we?

10:03.430 --> 10:06.107
Oh, that's fucking optimistic, isn't it?

10:06.211 --> 10:08.573
[shouting and arguing]

10:08.678 --> 10:09.442
Aidan!

10:09.545 --> 10:11.352
Don't be so fucking stupid!

10:11.457 --> 10:12.951
AIDAN: I'd rather risk this than stay

10:13.055 --> 10:15.314
with you moaning bastards a minute longer than I have to.

10:15.418 --> 10:17.433
If you die we're not coming for your body,

10:17.537 --> 10:18.544
you fucking asshole!

10:21.602 --> 10:24.589
Love you, kid.

10:24.694 --> 10:26.257
Aye, carrot and stick.

10:35.013 --> 10:36.367
The fuck are you doing?

10:36.472 --> 10:38.314
Making sure we're covered.

10:38.418 --> 10:40.329
You're writing him off already?

10:40.433 --> 10:41.822
What if he's dead?

10:41.926 --> 10:43.838
What if he's found shit loads of money and fucked off?

10:43.941 --> 10:45.262
What if he's got another woman?

10:45.367 --> 10:46.824
What if he's shot or in jail?

10:49.465 --> 10:50.334
Oh, don't be soft.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.141
I'm being practical.

10:52.246 --> 10:54.991
Look, if something happens me and Connor are on our own,

10:55.095 --> 10:57.109
and I need to know that we're going to be OK.

11:00.375 --> 11:05.100
You do what you need to do for your son, Mimi,

11:05.204 --> 11:06.698
and I will do the same for mine.

12:00.307 --> 12:01.835
[box pops open]

12:20.597 --> 12:23.341
You got a secret s

12:23.446 --> 12:26.086
Nothing that'd interest you.

12:26.190 --> 12:28.344
I'll just ask the lads what they think about that.

12:28.449 --> 12:30.326
Oh, fuck it, all right.

12:30.430 --> 12:33.521
All right, all right.

12:33.626 --> 12:41.199
Something that I left down here last time I came down.

12:41.304 --> 12:42.520
Wow.

12:42.625 --> 12:46.966
It's sentimental value.

12:47.071 --> 12:53.498
You know, it's trophies of an unspoiled life.

12:53.602 --> 12:56.383
Spliff, copy of "Shoot."

12:56.487 --> 12:57.807
Porn mag?

12:57.911 --> 12:59.857
Football, you dummy.

12:59.961 --> 13:02.706
Remember, something pure.

13:08.195 --> 13:09.550
Picture of the family.

13:13.545 --> 13:16.915
Oh, fuck off.

13:17.020 --> 13:19.139
It's a statement of intent.

13:27.269 --> 13:29.214
What's going on?

13:29.318 --> 13:30.570
Disaster relief.

13:30.674 --> 13:32.272
We're getting prepared in case we find them.

13:32.377 --> 13:34.322
We'll find them.

13:34.425 --> 13:37.935
Thermal blankets, cereal bars, water, vits.

13:38.039 --> 13:39.916
We need blood.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.452
Violence isn't the answer.

13:42.556 --> 13:45.301
For a blood transfusion, dopey.

13:45.405 --> 13:47.281
What if they've been in a shootout and one of them

13:47.386 --> 13:48.566
needs blood?

13:48.671 --> 13:51.623
Patty always kept a fridge-full, every blood group,

13:51.728 --> 13:53.049
just in case.

13:53.153 --> 13:55.515
AVRIL: Well, I'm not arguing with her.

13:55.619 --> 13:58.815
And that lot can volunteer.

13:58.920 --> 14:02.081
And any complaints, fuck off to another pub.

14:07.779 --> 14:09.551
Your Tish has locked herself in our bathroom

14:09.655 --> 14:12.782
and won't come out.

14:12.887 --> 14:14.729
[knocking on door]

14:14.833 --> 14:19.314
Tish, what's going on?

14:19.417 --> 14:21.050
I'll kick this door in, you know I will.

14:24.874 --> 14:26.158
I wanted something of Aidan's.

14:32.690 --> 14:34.184
Then I saw this.

14:34.288 --> 14:36.060
For God's sake.

14:36.164 --> 14:38.076
That might be all that's left of him.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.674
How do you know it's his?

14:39.779 --> 14:40.716
It could be--

14:40.820 --> 14:42.662
I do my business at Lillian's.

14:42.765 --> 14:44.851
There's no way my buttocks are sharing

14:44.955 --> 14:46.135
porcelain with Frank Gallagher.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.699
Or it could be Frank's.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.375
Frank's missing, and Mrs. Croker can't go up the stairs.

14:50.478 --> 14:51.417
It's not mine.

14:51.521 --> 14:53.432
I only go on Sundays.

14:53.536 --> 14:57.045
You only take a dump once a week?

14:57.149 --> 14:57.983
Regular.

15:03.924 --> 15:05.105
Come on.

15:05.210 --> 15:09.797
I'm not moving until Aidan comes home.

15:09.900 --> 15:13.999
"Truth is beauty and beauty is truth.

15:14.103 --> 15:18.551
Liberty, fraternity, and equality, a life worth living."

15:18.655 --> 15:19.558
Making a mark?

15:19.663 --> 15:20.531
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:20.635 --> 15:21.573
We get the picture.

15:21.677 --> 15:22.998
I was a dick when I was a lad.

15:23.103 --> 15:26.750
No, you had ambition and dreams.

15:26.854 --> 15:28.140
What's wrong with that?

15:28.243 --> 15:30.606
Ambition, dreams, principles.

15:30.711 --> 15:33.734
Life soon kicked the living shit out of that.

15:33.837 --> 15:37.521
Frank, it's not too late to turn your life around.

15:37.625 --> 15:40.717
Oh, don't dare pity me, you cheeky bint.

15:40.821 --> 15:43.983
I am happy with my lot.

15:44.087 --> 15:46.485
Ambition's a scam, designed to make

15:46.588 --> 15:49.889
sure you keep your head down, be an obedient little consumer.

15:54.023 --> 15:55.865
I'm just being supportive.

15:55.970 --> 15:58.401
Well, don't.

15:58.506 --> 16:00.486
Sort your own house out.

16:00.590 --> 16:02.536
Trying to wheedle your way into a family

16:02.640 --> 16:05.106
most people would try and wheedle their way out of.

16:05.212 --> 16:06.427
I'm not trying to wheedle my--

16:06.531 --> 16:08.581
You don't count as blood to the Maguires

16:08.685 --> 16:12.056
unless you slithered out of Mimi's scally muff.

16:12.160 --> 16:16.710
And you didn't, so you don't.

16:16.815 --> 16:18.448
Fuck knows why you'd want to.

16:22.479 --> 16:25.015
B positive, yeah nurse?

16:25.119 --> 16:26.439
[groaning]

16:26.543 --> 16:28.663
That hurts.

16:28.766 --> 16:29.530
Oh.

16:29.636 --> 16:31.789
Will you stop fucking whining?

16:31.893 --> 16:33.630
It's a good deal--

16:33.736 --> 16:35.785
pint for a pint.

16:35.889 --> 16:37.905
Which ridiculously overvalues you lot.

16:40.406 --> 16:43.498
Do 25 and we'll let you go free.

16:46.972 --> 16:48.050
Clear.

16:48.154 --> 16:50.446
Do it in block capitals!

16:50.550 --> 16:53.434
Oh, right.

16:53.539 --> 16:54.859
Right.

16:54.963 --> 16:57.986
I'm off to see a man about a shit.

17:00.661 --> 17:03.649
I thought she only did all her business at Lillian's

17:03.752 --> 17:05.664
[donor groaning loudly]

17:13.690 --> 17:19.108
Please, God, or whoever the fuck's up there,

17:19.214 --> 17:21.575
bring Shane back.

17:21.680 --> 17:22.653
I'll do anything.

17:22.758 --> 17:24.459
I'll devote my life to you.

17:29.288 --> 17:31.270
[sizzling]

17:59.098 --> 18:00.906
It's fucking warm.

18:01.010 --> 18:02.991
It's a body fluid.

18:03.095 --> 18:04.449
It's good for you.

18:04.553 --> 18:07.437
Probably bits of jizz and god-knows-what

18:07.542 --> 18:09.070
washed out in his sample.

18:09.174 --> 18:10.703
You might as well have given him a nosh, put

18:10.807 --> 18:12.302
the poor lad out of his misery.

18:17.305 --> 18:17.965
Ruby?

18:18.069 --> 18:19.562
[groaning]

18:19.668 --> 18:21.126
Mm-mm.

18:21.230 --> 18:26.928
Look, you can't live off of toothpaste alone, you know?

18:27.032 --> 18:29.394
I know, I know.

18:29.498 --> 18:32.035
Come here.

18:32.139 --> 18:33.494
We're gonna be all right.

18:33.599 --> 18:35.162
All right?

18:35.267 --> 18:36.134
Yeah?

18:36.239 --> 18:37.073
Mm-hm.

18:41.763 --> 18:43.292
The fuck are you doing?

18:43.396 --> 18:44.578
[chuckles]

18:44.683 --> 18:46.627
- I don't know, I just think-- - Well then don't think.

18:46.731 --> 18:47.669
We're family!

18:47.774 --> 18:48.608
Fuck off!

18:48.711 --> 18:50.518
You were all over me!

18:50.623 --> 18:52.395
Was I the fuck all over you?

18:52.499 --> 18:53.784
Cut it out, Ruby!

18:53.888 --> 18:55.765
Uh, a bit of consideration wouldn't go amiss.

18:55.870 --> 18:58.162
You're the twat that brought the fucking shaft down!

18:58.266 --> 19:01.741
Oh, yeah, it's my fault for trying to escape my captors,

19:01.845 --> 19:03.825
my kidnappers, innit?

19:03.929 --> 19:05.006
How selfish am I.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.397
You weren't kidnapped!

19:06.500 --> 19:09.001
Well, blackmailed at the very fucking least,

19:09.106 --> 19:10.670
over the life of an innocent.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.928
Tight bastard, you said he was missing.

19:13.033 --> 19:15.673
You are not fucking eating him!

19:15.777 --> 19:18.000
BILLY: That's the building, and that's the shaft there.

19:18.105 --> 19:18.868
SHANE: You don't know what you're on about.

19:18.972 --> 19:19.565
No, look.

19:19.669 --> 19:20.885
That padlock's off it.

19:20.988 --> 19:22.344
Open it up.

19:22.448 --> 19:23.664
There's rubble down there.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.435
It must have collapsed.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.353
Shit.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.430
[indistinct arguing from below]

19:29.536 --> 19:32.559
Shh, I can hear voices.

19:32.662 --> 19:33.878
Shh, let's go.

19:33.982 --> 19:35.927
Jamie?

19:36.032 --> 19:39.089
I can hear voices, it's coming from here.

19:39.194 --> 19:40.374
Shh, Jamie?

19:40.478 --> 19:42.043
(ANGRILY) I'm warning you, Frank.

19:42.147 --> 19:43.085
MIMI: Jamie? Are you all right?

19:43.189 --> 19:43.744
Are you alive? Are you OK?

19:43.849 --> 19:44.544
Mum!

19:44.648 --> 19:46.177
Mum, we're down here.

19:46.281 --> 19:47.220
Mum, we're alive!

19:47.324 --> 19:48.262
[cheering]

19:48.366 --> 19:49.199
Yes!

19:49.303 --> 19:50.589
We're OK.

19:50.693 --> 19:52.292
Where the fuck have you been?

19:52.396 --> 19:53.959
Aidan, nice one mate.

19:54.064 --> 19:55.384
I knew you'd do it.

19:55.488 --> 19:57.747
What the fuck's Aidan got to do with it?

19:57.851 --> 20:00.004
Jamie, we haven't seen Aidan, lad.

20:00.110 --> 20:02.089
So who told you we were down here?

20:02.194 --> 20:04.591
MIMI: Someone only broke the golden rule.

20:04.696 --> 20:06.641
Who's been a naughty boy, Jamie?

20:09.489 --> 20:10.983
The fuck have you done?

20:11.087 --> 20:16.681
Only went and told Dom all about the job-- how, where, when.

20:16.786 --> 20:19.740
Best mistake you ever made, son.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.996
Yeah, well I fucking forgot, didn't I?

20:26.652 --> 20:29.362
I drank his fucking piss, Jamie.

20:29.466 --> 20:32.038
[nauseated groaning]

20:32.143 --> 20:34.399
Because you said that nobody knew.

20:34.504 --> 20:35.860
MIMI: Don't worry about a thing.

20:35.963 --> 20:38.083
We'll rob a tent off the tram extension,

20:38.187 --> 20:39.438
nobody will think twice.

20:39.543 --> 20:42.669
And this place is fucking deserted over the bank holiday.

20:42.774 --> 20:43.920
Go on, get going.

20:44.024 --> 20:46.387
We'll all have to do it the other way.

20:51.076 --> 20:53.300
Look, we can't stay too long, OK?

20:53.405 --> 20:55.177
Her husband could be dead, for fuck's sake.

20:55.282 --> 20:57.296
What have you got on more pressing than that?

20:57.401 --> 20:59.172
There's loads of folk who'll cover, you know.

20:59.276 --> 21:00.874
Go upstairs, rest.

21:00.978 --> 21:04.383
I'm all right.

21:04.487 --> 21:06.086
Sweep.

21:06.190 --> 21:07.372
What?

21:07.477 --> 21:09.491
For them underground-- who croaks first, and when.

21:09.596 --> 21:12.132
It's times like this when folk need a distraction.

21:12.236 --> 21:15.605
What if he's not on a job, and he's on the fucking job?

21:15.710 --> 21:17.169
Oh, it's a chuffing orgy, is it?

21:17.274 --> 21:18.524
With his own brother and Frank Gallagher?

21:18.628 --> 21:20.504
Well, he's acting weird.

21:20.609 --> 21:23.110
Get out from behind that fucking bar, I'll do a shift.

21:23.214 --> 21:25.126
[cell phone vibrates]

21:33.324 --> 21:34.227
Oh my God.

21:34.331 --> 21:36.416
They found him.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.355
They're alive.

21:41.142 --> 21:44.302
Except Aidan is missing.

21:44.407 --> 21:46.284
I wonder if anyone's picked him?

21:46.388 --> 21:48.508
[coughing]

22:08.276 --> 22:09.283
Oh, shit.

22:25.334 --> 22:26.169
Fuck.

22:34.473 --> 22:35.305
Here you are.

22:35.411 --> 22:37.600
Sound, bro.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.024
When can I get this back?

22:39.128 --> 22:40.830
You'll get it when you fucking get it, all right?

22:40.934 --> 22:42.325
Fuck off!

22:42.430 --> 22:43.297
Let's go.

22:45.938 --> 22:46.806
Are you ready?

22:46.910 --> 22:48.196
Here's the first one.

22:52.331 --> 22:53.720
There'll be plenty to go around.

22:53.824 --> 22:55.631
Little sips, yeah?

22:55.735 --> 22:56.569
Water.

22:59.800 --> 23:00.669
Water.

23:03.656 --> 23:04.596
Here you are, Frank.

23:04.700 --> 23:05.776
Here's a bevvy.

23:08.798 --> 23:10.292
[can cracks open]

23:13.420 --> 23:14.287
Shane!

23:18.109 --> 23:19.639
Give us one of those, Frank.

23:28.671 --> 23:29.611
The fuck's that?

23:29.714 --> 23:32.181
It's a webcam, Shane.

23:32.286 --> 23:33.709
Thank fuck.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.308
Back in the 21st century.

23:38.851 --> 23:39.824
Sorted, yeah!

23:39.928 --> 23:41.040
[cheering]

23:41.144 --> 23:42.326
Gentlemen, we've got eyes and ears.

23:42.431 --> 23:43.298
And ears.

23:43.403 --> 23:44.445
- No way, can you see us? - Yeah!

23:44.550 --> 23:45.417
Yeah.

23:45.523 --> 23:46.183
Ha, ha.

23:46.287 --> 23:47.884
Is-- is, uh, mum up there?

23:47.990 --> 23:50.420
You look terrible.

23:50.525 --> 23:51.392
How you holding up?

23:51.498 --> 23:52.819
OK?

23:52.923 --> 23:54.938
Yeah, we're fine now we've got the provisions.

23:55.042 --> 23:57.752
Um, listen, have you heard from Aidan?

24:00.774 --> 24:03.310
Hello?

24:03.414 --> 24:04.387
Nothing.

24:04.493 --> 24:07.097
No word.

24:07.202 --> 24:09.355
Here are some batteries. Watch your heads.

24:12.449 --> 24:14.254
When you're running low, send the old ones up

24:14.358 --> 24:16.200
and we'll recharge them.

24:16.304 --> 24:17.208
Hiya, baby.

24:17.312 --> 24:19.187
How are you, son?

24:19.292 --> 24:20.577
Hi, mum.

24:20.683 --> 24:23.009
Um, cheers for helping out, mum.

24:23.113 --> 24:25.788
That's what your mum's for, son.

24:25.893 --> 24:27.109
Love ya.

24:27.215 --> 24:31.070
Oh, I love you too, and I miss you so much.

24:31.174 --> 24:33.780
- Hey, Ches? - Yes, Jamie?

24:33.884 --> 24:35.864
Great spliff, mate.

24:35.969 --> 24:37.950
[coughing]

24:41.597 --> 24:43.751
[rattling in ducts]

24:58.239 --> 24:59.768
[aidan screams]

25:01.609 --> 25:02.443
Shh.

25:13.457 --> 25:14.325
AIDAN: Wait.

25:21.690 --> 25:23.670
[grunting]

25:35.623 --> 25:37.534
It's fucking horrible down here.

25:37.638 --> 25:39.305
I know, I feel sick.

25:39.410 --> 25:41.251
Right.

25:41.355 --> 25:43.578
We'll go in through the top, so long

25:43.683 --> 25:44.934
as we shore it up as we go.

25:45.039 --> 25:46.984
All right, well we'll do it in shifts, yeah?

25:47.089 --> 25:50.111
There's no space to dig side-by-side.

25:50.214 --> 25:51.952
Do a time and motion study, did you?

25:52.057 --> 25:53.098
No.

25:53.203 --> 25:54.558
No one's done them since the '70s.

25:54.661 --> 25:57.129
Just physics-- mass, space, and time.

25:57.234 --> 26:00.187
Anyway, you do first shift, and I'll rest up.

26:06.996 --> 26:08.003
Mum?

26:11.026 --> 26:14.639
Mum, you there?

26:14.743 --> 26:15.751
Mum?

26:15.855 --> 26:19.921
She's got them going on the dig, Jamie.

26:20.025 --> 26:21.241
Who's that?

26:21.344 --> 26:22.179
It's Dom.

26:33.818 --> 26:36.285
JAMIE: Thank fuck you remembered where we were, eh?

26:43.754 --> 26:46.881
Well, as you know, I was pissed

26:46.986 --> 26:49.869
as a newt when you told me.

26:49.973 --> 26:52.614
Difficulty was putting together all the little things

26:52.718 --> 26:54.455
that I thought I knew.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.330
I can imagine.

26:56.434 --> 26:59.041
Ah, Gloria was a great help, though.

26:59.144 --> 27:02.863
You know, she managed to make sense of it all for me.

27:02.966 --> 27:04.182
Is she there?

27:04.286 --> 27:06.719
I believe she's at the pub with your Karen.

27:10.958 --> 27:12.314
Was she upset?

27:17.003 --> 27:19.052
Now which she are we talking about here?

27:22.492 --> 27:23.362
My wife.

27:27.358 --> 27:28.955
I let her know you were OK.

27:32.533 --> 27:34.653
But she didn't come down?

27:39.690 --> 27:42.644
Dominic?

27:42.748 --> 27:44.451
Give Karen a call, yeah?

27:44.555 --> 27:45.667
Tell her I'm all right.

27:45.770 --> 27:48.446
Tell her I said--

27:48.549 --> 27:49.454
tell her I said--

27:53.692 --> 27:54.526
Dom?

27:58.069 --> 27:58.938
Dom?

28:38.857 --> 28:40.838
[metallic rumbling]

28:49.245 --> 28:51.227
[crash]

28:58.661 --> 28:59.496
Help.

29:10.023 --> 29:11.169
You all right now?

29:11.272 --> 29:12.385
Comfortable? - No, man.

29:12.489 --> 29:13.775
My legs are falling asleep.

29:17.353 --> 29:18.812
We're making good progress.

29:18.916 --> 29:20.654
Must've had 40 buckets out.

29:20.757 --> 29:23.537
1,696 cubic inches a bucket.

29:23.641 --> 29:26.108
That's 480 kilos.

29:26.213 --> 29:27.567
You've just fucking made that up.

29:27.672 --> 29:29.896
Fair enough, but it can't be that far.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.119
You're doing a good job anyway.

29:32.223 --> 29:34.029
My shift in 40 minutes, yeah?

29:37.990 --> 29:40.075
We need to get rid of the scratchcards.

29:40.179 --> 29:41.847
If we get pulled, they're evidence.

29:41.951 --> 29:43.237
It's the whole reason we're here.

29:43.341 --> 29:44.836
And where are we going to cash them?

29:44.940 --> 29:46.572
As soon as people find out the tunnel's collapsed,

29:46.676 --> 29:49.072
they're gonna be looking for them.

29:49.177 --> 29:51.922
Small prizes, multiple locations.

29:52.027 --> 29:53.382
Always stay one step ahead.

29:53.485 --> 29:57.830
So why did you let it slip to Dom?

29:57.933 --> 30:00.920
Well, just be glad I did, or we'd be stuck here permanently.

30:01.025 --> 30:04.673
Besides you were hardly a model of self-control.

30:04.778 --> 30:05.889
What the fuck does that mean?

30:05.993 --> 30:07.557
Means you led him on with his knob.

30:07.661 --> 30:08.529
Did I?

30:08.634 --> 30:10.511
Well, who'd of though it?

30:10.615 --> 30:12.768
I've got the moral high ground.

30:12.872 --> 30:14.402
[crash]

30:14.507 --> 30:15.234
Ahh!

30:15.340 --> 30:18.918
JAMIE: Oh, fucking hell, Frank!

30:19.021 --> 30:20.377
What have you done, Frank?

30:20.482 --> 30:23.468
I didn't touch it!

30:23.573 --> 30:25.171
[police sirens]

30:34.065 --> 30:35.420
Fuck!

30:35.526 --> 30:36.462
Hurry up!

30:36.568 --> 30:38.512
This will definitely work.

30:38.617 --> 30:40.563
What are you guys doing?

30:40.667 --> 30:42.196
A fucking tampon?

30:48.866 --> 30:49.979
What?

30:50.082 --> 30:54.392
You think that would expand and block the pipe?

30:54.496 --> 30:56.058
Oh, you've got another one, have you?

30:56.162 --> 30:57.240
Oh, great.

30:57.344 --> 30:59.499
Maybe that one will blow up to a five-man dinghy,

30:59.602 --> 31:00.748
and we can sail on out.

31:00.853 --> 31:02.381
Ah, fucking funny.

31:02.486 --> 31:03.771
Oh, for fuck's sake.

31:03.876 --> 31:06.169
Right, let's get all this lot off the floor and in here

31:06.272 --> 31:07.315
before it starts flooding.

31:09.956 --> 31:11.032
MARTY: It doesn't look right.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.805
Because it's fucking pasta sauce.

31:12.908 --> 31:14.611
Let's just hope they don't need it.

31:18.294 --> 31:19.893
Don't fucking ask.

31:19.997 --> 31:24.340
Let's just accept life is weird and move on.

31:24.444 --> 31:25.486
Tish still upstairs?

31:25.590 --> 31:27.362
[scoffs]

31:33.060 --> 31:34.693
Tish, you still with us?

31:38.202 --> 31:41.224
Tell me you are fucking joking.

31:41.328 --> 31:42.197
Show some respect.

31:45.289 --> 31:46.818
[door slams]

31:47.756 --> 31:49.214
[police sirens in distance]

31:50.118 --> 31:51.890
We've got trouble.

31:51.995 --> 31:54.148
[rumbling]

31:55.086 --> 31:57.658
[water gushing]

32:01.305 --> 32:04.294
Shit.

32:04.398 --> 32:05.301
Jamie?

32:05.405 --> 32:07.560
[sparks flying]

32:13.500 --> 32:15.968
What if he doesn't come out, G, and my last memory's

32:16.072 --> 32:17.253
us two arguing?

32:17.357 --> 32:18.816
Oh, he'll come back and you'll be fine.

32:18.921 --> 32:20.554
You've had a tiff, so what?

32:20.657 --> 32:23.924
If ever there were a couple made for each other, it's you two.

32:24.027 --> 32:26.285
At least I can look good for him when he comes out.

32:26.390 --> 32:27.815
That's my girl.

32:27.919 --> 32:29.379
In my experience, there's not much a fellow won't risk

32:29.482 --> 32:30.628
for the sake of a good ride.

32:36.848 --> 32:38.029
How are we getting on?

32:42.060 --> 32:43.832
What's wrong? Is Jamie OK?

32:43.935 --> 32:45.221
Can

32:45.325 --> 32:47.063
We've had a setback.

32:47.167 --> 32:48.765
There's been a second collapse.

32:48.869 --> 32:51.058
- But is he OK? - Camera feed's down.

32:51.161 --> 32:52.621
We don't know.

32:52.726 --> 32:54.671
Billy's down there, too.

32:54.775 --> 32:56.026
What if I lost my boys?

33:01.446 --> 33:06.275
If she finds out, Mimi will quite literally

33:06.379 --> 33:09.019
gargle with your testicles.

33:09.124 --> 33:10.514
You won't be in the room, but she'll

33:10.617 --> 33:11.870
gargle with them nonetheless.

33:11.974 --> 33:14.126
It's your fault.

33:14.231 --> 33:16.246
Well, it usually is.

33:16.350 --> 33:19.060
We expand, just to humor me.

33:21.736 --> 33:23.056
You still love Shane.

33:27.886 --> 33:29.241
Bring Shane back.

33:29.345 --> 33:32.263
I'll devote my life. - And the rest.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.961
It's superstition-- rabbit's foot,

33:38.065 --> 33:39.489
Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny.

33:39.594 --> 33:41.922
It's any old port in a storm.

33:42.027 --> 33:46.091
I prayed for Shane to come back, and I got this for Jamie.

33:46.195 --> 33:49.669
I'm fasting for Frank, rosary for Aidan,

33:49.774 --> 33:52.865
and I'm wearing this for the cranky Scotch one.

33:52.969 --> 33:54.777
You promised you'd devote your life.

33:54.881 --> 33:56.827
I didn't mean it.

33:56.931 --> 33:58.112
It's a crisis.

33:58.217 --> 34:00.613
People promise any old shite in a crisis.

34:08.569 --> 34:11.453
Billy and Jackson are all right.

34:11.556 --> 34:12.773
They're coming up.

34:12.877 --> 34:14.996
[police sirens]

34:16.143 --> 34:17.498
You OK?

34:17.603 --> 34:19.271
Look at them.

34:19.375 --> 34:21.737
We're over here, all Great Escape and that.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.717
But they're just totally oblivious.

34:23.822 --> 34:25.351
Fuck this.

34:25.455 --> 34:26.775
Where are you going?

34:26.879 --> 34:29.831
They could be near their last breath down there.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.255
We need help.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.958
Not the police.

34:33.063 --> 34:34.627
It's your son that's down there.

34:34.731 --> 34:37.650
You know, the one that you care so much about.

34:37.754 --> 34:38.762
[chuckles]

34:38.866 --> 34:40.045
It's funny, innit?

34:40.150 --> 34:42.062
It's all been about Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

34:42.167 --> 34:43.277
Not even a mention of Shane.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.431
Hey, we're here for Shane all right?

34:45.536 --> 34:47.170
Look, we're all here for everyone.

34:47.273 --> 34:48.697
Give us one more go.

34:48.803 --> 34:50.920
If we can't get through, then call the police.

34:51.025 --> 34:51.929
Yeah. We're close, Karen.

34:52.034 --> 34:54.047
We can do it.

34:54.152 --> 34:55.402
Come on.

34:55.507 --> 34:57.002
Let's get a shift on.

34:57.106 --> 34:58.738
JACKSON: Yeah, and two hands are better than one this time.

34:58.843 --> 35:01.553
BILLY: You mean four hands are better than two.

35:01.656 --> 35:02.943
[sparking]

35:03.047 --> 35:05.305
Fucking had it with this place!

35:05.410 --> 35:08.084
FRANK: No, no!

35:08.189 --> 35:09.509
What, it's not dangerous, is it?

35:09.613 --> 35:10.759
Fucking lethal, I think.

35:10.863 --> 35:12.740
Well, that's how they kill people on films, innit?

35:12.844 --> 35:15.381
They throw a toaster in the bath and that.

35:15.485 --> 35:18.021
No, I think you'll find that salt water conducts.

35:18.125 --> 35:19.828
Fresh water's safe enough.

35:19.932 --> 35:20.591
[frank yells]

35:20.696 --> 35:21.947
Oh, well, be my guest.

35:22.051 --> 35:22.989
[rumbling]

35:23.093 --> 35:24.901
Whoa!

35:25.004 --> 35:27.888
You know as well as I do, prison would kill him.

35:27.992 --> 35:29.348
He could be All already.

35:29.452 --> 35:30.771
Don't say that.

35:30.876 --> 35:33.655
And if he isn't, I don't care if he goes down.

35:33.760 --> 35:38.241
I just want him back in one piece.

35:38.345 --> 35:42.342
If he don't make it, this is on your head.

35:42.446 --> 35:43.766
May God forgive you.

35:43.869 --> 35:46.754
Move.

35:46.858 --> 35:49.081
No, Mimi.

35:49.186 --> 35:52.591
Get off.

35:52.695 --> 35:55.127
Oh my God, the whole place is coming down.

35:55.231 --> 35:57.489
We need to get the cable out of the water,

35:57.594 --> 35:58.948
or we'll all fucking dead.

35:59.052 --> 36:00.615
Volunteers?

36:00.720 --> 36:02.423
[sparking]

36:02.528 --> 36:06.418
I've been a certified coward all my life, mate.

36:06.522 --> 36:07.425
How about you, big man?

36:07.530 --> 36:09.302
Want to show us how it's done?

36:09.406 --> 36:10.796
No chance.

36:10.900 --> 36:11.734
Fuck it.

36:11.838 --> 36:12.533
Whoa!

36:12.637 --> 36:13.956
You'll kill yourself, mate.

36:14.061 --> 36:15.763
Not if I get the cable out of the water before I

36:15.868 --> 36:16.737
hit the surface.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.196
Oh, yeah?

36:18.299 --> 36:19.899
And what about the leccy that's already in the water?

36:20.002 --> 36:21.045
Well, I don't know, do I?

36:21.148 --> 36:22.644
Fucking-- - Oh, for fuck's sake!

36:22.747 --> 36:24.588
If you want to stand around discussing the finer points--

36:24.694 --> 36:25.735
[sparking]

36:25.840 --> 36:28.619
On my count of three, let me go.

36:33.934 --> 36:36.331
One.

36:36.436 --> 36:37.374
[sparking]

36:37.479 --> 36:39.111
Oh!

36:39.216 --> 36:40.050
Two.

36:45.782 --> 36:46.720
[sparking]

36:46.824 --> 36:48.249
Oh!

36:48.352 --> 36:51.167
Would it be any easier if you went on a count of four?

36:51.271 --> 36:54.433
I want to do it, but my legs aren't cooperating.

36:58.359 --> 36:59.228
We're through.

36:59.332 --> 37:00.479
Buzzing!

37:00.582 --> 37:01.416
JACKSON: Hello?

37:01.520 --> 37:02.529
Can you hear us?

37:02.633 --> 37:03.952
Oi, Jackson!

37:04.056 --> 37:05.968
Jackson, stay where you are, mate!

37:06.071 --> 37:08.574
We've got a huge problem in here!

37:08.678 --> 37:09.998
[billy laughs]

37:10.102 --> 37:11.318
How unpopular are you?

37:11.422 --> 37:14.027
Even buried people don't wanna see you.

37:14.133 --> 37:15.314
Well, go on.

37:15.418 --> 37:16.808
I thought you were seedless, not impotent.

37:16.913 --> 37:18.892
How about you go in, Frank?

37:18.996 --> 37:20.977
[yelling and arguing]

37:36.333 --> 37:37.202
Ruby!

37:37.306 --> 37:38.140
No!

37:49.606 --> 37:50.716
(IN SLOW MOTION) Go!

37:54.365 --> 37:57.388
JAMIE: Go!

37:57.492 --> 37:59.472
Get out!

37:59.577 --> 38:01.557
[rumbling]

38:02.703 --> 38:04.684
[sparking]

38:13.855 --> 38:15.488
Hello, partner.

38:15.593 --> 38:17.156
I'll kiss you when I taste fresh air, mate.

38:20.353 --> 38:22.299
[grunting]

38:37.829 --> 38:39.774
[coughing]

38:47.522 --> 38:49.295
You're not coming?

38:49.398 --> 38:50.683
You can't stay here.

38:50.787 --> 38:51.657
Come on.

39:13.023 --> 39:15.247
Fuck's sake, hurry up.

39:15.352 --> 39:17.054
How many more?

39:17.158 --> 39:18.165
BILLY: Two, plus Ches.

39:18.268 --> 39:19.485
Well, what about Aidan?

39:19.589 --> 39:20.841
JACKSON: Nobody knows where he is.

39:20.945 --> 39:22.057
He's been gone for hours.

39:22.161 --> 39:23.202
The collapse happened awhile ago.

39:23.307 --> 39:24.211
He could be anywhere.
