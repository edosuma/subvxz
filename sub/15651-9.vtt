12:11.605 --> 12:14.358
but experienced collectors
know better.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.819
Just look at that

12:16.902 --> 12:18.320
That's a wigged bird, all right.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.115
He's not fooling anybody.

12:21.198 --> 12:22.575
Here he comes.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.897
I DON'T KNOW, FILBURT.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.316
BIRD WIGGING IS SO INHUMANE.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.484
INHUMANE?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.819
IT'S NOT INHUMANE.

12:58.903 --> 12:59.904
IT'S FUN.

I HEAR THE LADIES
REALLY DIG BALD HEADS.

21:41.299 --> 21:43.135
YEAH.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.554
YOU COULD BE A STAR

21:45.637 --> 21:47.431
A MASCOT

21:47.514 --> 21:50.183
A SYMBOL EMBOSSED ON A COIN

21:50.267 --> 21:52.811
OR EVEN A NATIONAL BIRD.

21:54.604 --> 21:55.814
YEAH.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.065
YES!

21:57.149 --> 21:58.734
(<i> growling</i> )

21:58.817 --> 22:00.444
HERE.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.529
I WON'T NEED THIS ANYMORE.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.239
GEE, THANK YOU.

22:04.322 --> 22:07.117
I GOT A DATE WITH A RAZOR.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.201
(<i> screams</i> )

22:08.285 --> 22:10.328
HEY, FILBURT, I GOT YOUR...

22:10.412 --> 22:11.455
(<i> crashing</i> )

22:11.538 --> 22:12.622
OH, DEAR.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.876
OH, THE HUMILIATION.

22:15.959 --> 22:17.878
YOU OKAY, FILBURT?

22:17.961 --> 22:19.963
I HOPE YOU BROUGHT TAPE.

22:20.047 --> 22:22.382
NO, BUT I BROUGHT
THE EAGLE'S WIG.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.426
GET THAT THING
AWAY FROM ME.

22:24.509 --> 22:28.597
{\an1}YOU'RE NOT STICKING ME
WITH STOLEN MERCHANDISE.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.057
THAT WIG IS HOT.

22:31.224 --> 22:32.893
LOOK, IT'S RAINING WIGS!

22:32.976 --> 22:35.103
GOOD-BYE, HEAD TURF.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.773
I'M A FREE EAGLE NOW.

22:39.191 --> 22:42.444
{\an1}BUT IT'S NOT STEALING
IF SOMEONE THREW THEM AWAY.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.446
{\an1}QUIT TRYING TO CONFUSE ME
WITH THE TRUTH.

22:44.529 --> 22:48.742
{\an1}THEY'RE NOT PINNING
NO WIG STEALING RAP ON ME.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.080
THERE.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.415
JUST LIKE WE FOUND IT.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.632
WOW, THESE ARE GREAT.
