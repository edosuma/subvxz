00:31.920 --> 00:38.100
[sporadic laughter]

00:39.100 --> 00:41.520
Wait, can you say that again?
I can’t hear you.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.400
And have you heard from him,
any better?

00:44.800 --> 00:47.700
Ok… yeah.
Don’t worry.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.860
Yeah, I’ll talk to you tomorrow.
Love you.

00:50.860 --> 00:51.660
Sorry!

00:53.020 --> 00:53.820
Pardon?

00:53.820 --> 00:53.824
Pardon?
Sorry for being loud whilst
you were on the phone.

00:53.824 --> 00:56.500
Sorry for being loud whilst
you were on the phone.

00:56.600 --> 00:57.860
Oh… it’s ok.

00:59.740 --> 01:01.020
See you inside!

01:01.490 --> 01:04.120
[rhythmic guitar continues playing]

01:06.100 --> 01:09.250
She walked in hand and continued
on the same street light.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.940
“I left my gloves”,
she finally confesses.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.760
“I’m not going back”, I said.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.200
Anybody else?

01:20.960 --> 01:23.760
This is my poem, it’s called...

01:23.980 --> 01:25.820
‘Rage in Minor B,'

01:26.360 --> 01:28.380
'my fight with the Undemented'.

01:29.730 --> 01:30.980
[background chatter]

01:31.620 --> 01:33.780
Sorry Nathan, I’ve gotta go.

01:33.820 --> 01:35.530
No, there’s still so much
drinking to be done-

01:35.530 --> 01:37.150
I drove so I can’t really
have any more.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.780
Thanks, it’s been great though.

01:40.380 --> 01:41.180
Actually-

01:42.280 --> 01:43.400
Where are you going?

01:43.520 --> 01:44.260
What?

01:44.500 --> 01:45.400
What direction
are you driving?

01:45.410 --> 01:46.620
Oh, erh... east.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.240
Yeah, me too. I’m–

01:48.260 --> 01:50.040
Do you mind if
I grab a lift?

01:50.080 --> 01:51.960
No that’s fine,
but I’m going now.

01:51.960 --> 01:52.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
me too.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.900
I’m just gonna
finish this drink.

01:55.180 --> 01:55.920
Do you mind, or…

01:56.460 --> 01:57.620
No, that’s fine, yeah.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.180
Do you want me
to plate yours?

02:07.700 --> 02:09.419
Plate,
you mean plaite?

02:09.900 --> 02:11.720
Plate, plait…

02:12.260 --> 02:13.070
Whatever.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.840
Probably not
the best moment.

02:17.140 --> 02:18.520
Pull over then!

02:18.520 --> 02:20.520
[rhythmic guitar playing continues]

[wind rushing in tunnel]

02:37.670 --> 02:38.760
[music fades out]

02:38.980 --> 02:41.960
You know I don’t have to leave you here,
I can take you home.

02:42.380 --> 02:43.720
What’s your number?

02:44.080 --> 02:46.080
We can hang out again
if you want.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.040
Thanks for the lift.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.040
I’ll let you know
if I go out.

02:51.540 --> 02:52.190
Sure.

02:54.330 --> 02:54.800
Bye!

02:54.870 --> 02:55.110
Bye.

02:57.615 --> 02:58.908

03:07.120 --> 03:13.290
[slow, somber music with humming vocals]

03:59.260 --> 04:01.130
[speaking French]
Donne-moi de l'eau.

04:09.470 --> 04:11.100
[speaking French]
Au revoir!

04:11.100 --> 04:12.730
[speaking French]
Au revoir, Charlie.

07:07.980 --> 07:09.280

Excusez-moi,

07:09.280 --> 07:11.320
[speaking French]
C'est une propriétée privée içi.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.700
[speaking French]
Tu comprends?

07:14.980 --> 07:16.080
I don't speak French.

07:18.360 --> 07:19.300
You can't be here.

07:20.510 --> 07:21.300
Do you understand?

07:23.320 --> 07:24.180
Where can I be then?

07:27.340 --> 07:27.930
You live here?

07:28.840 --> 07:29.500
My dad–

07:30.210 --> 07:31.020
My family…

07:31.770 --> 07:32.310
I'm just...

07:33.080 --> 07:33.970
Looking after it.

07:37.860 --> 07:38.390
Thanks.

07:39.420 --> 07:40.070
It’s fine.

07:44.710 --> 07:45.550
So...

07:46.600 --> 07:48.730
What’s the name of this town?

07:49.380 --> 07:51.820
Saint-Léger-en-Charnie.

07:52.030 --> 07:54.780
Saint-Léger-en… Rahgie…

07:54.920 --> 07:56.660
That last word
didn’t even–

07:57.260 --> 07:58.170
Wasn’t even close.

07:58.280 --> 08:03.750
Saint-Léger-en-Charnie.

08:05.640 --> 08:06.150
Yap. Pretty good.

08:06.680 --> 08:07.540
En Charnie…

08:07.740 --> 08:10.450
Yeah, without the
neck, but yeah.

08:10.830 --> 08:11.560
En Charnie.

08:11.590 --> 08:13.450
I’m really bad
at French.

08:13.910 --> 08:14.240
Yeah.

08:16.850 --> 08:18.680
[chatter, glasses clinking,
music on radio]

08:24.240 --> 08:25.890
So where are you
staying tonight?

08:28.920 --> 08:29.590
I don’t know.

08:36.890 --> 08:37.530
Let’s walk.

08:38.200 --> 08:38.650
Why?

08:44.795 --> 08:46.421
[car boot closing]

08:47.330 --> 08:48.290
Yeah, that way.

08:56.700 --> 08:57.560
Oh god!

08:59.490 --> 09:00.090
Jesus.

09:02.050 --> 09:04.180
I could have done without
that, you know.

09:13.140 --> 09:13.870
Oh, sorry!

09:13.870 --> 09:15.870
[Mia laughing]

09:21.500 --> 09:22.040
Who’s home?

09:25.110 --> 09:25.820
It’s my home.

09:27.180 --> 09:28.470
No, who is home?

09:29.810 --> 09:31.000
Oh. Nobody.

09:42.350 --> 09:44.810
[glass clinking]

09:48.210 --> 09:49.650
What do you think?

09:53.970 --> 09:55.390
I have to see it all first.

10:02.140 --> 10:04.200
I’ll show you where
you can sleep.

10:08.830 --> 10:13.710

[door shuts]

10:39.150 --> 10:42.620
[birds chirping]

11:06.320 --> 11:06.800
Morning!

11:08.590 --> 11:09.120
Morning.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.360
Ready?

11:15.770 --> 11:16.980
[slow guitar playing]

11:17.070 --> 11:17.560
Really?

11:19.320 --> 11:20.560
Do you want to sit
on the back?

11:20.590 --> 11:20.890
Yeah.

11:37.790 --> 11:38.800
Someone’s heavy.

11:44.150 --> 11:45.410
I hate this bike.

11:47.110 --> 11:49.460
You’ve been on it
like three seconds.

11:49.470 --> 11:50.140
Ouch!

11:53.750 --> 11:54.470
Get off the bike.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.140
Please.

11:58.620 --> 11:59.820
I’m leaving
your jacket.

11:59.850 --> 12:00.120
No.

12:00.380 --> 12:00.960
I’m leaving it.

12:07.490 --> 12:10.000
[music becoming more intense]

12:29.140 --> 12:32.310
[church bells ringing]

12:38.070 --> 12:38.770
Oh shit!

12:53.490 --> 12:57.170
I’ll ask the bar if they
can hang on to it.

13:06.590 --> 13:09.140
[slow guitar and electronic music]

13:19.180 --> 13:20.900
What are you doing in Vaiges?

13:24.650 --> 13:25.680
You’re such a pisshead.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.030
I told you last night.

13:34.490 --> 13:36.380
If you can’t be bothered
to listen, then…

13:36.570 --> 13:39.140
Or you could just
make something up.

13:45.550 --> 13:46.340
I...

13:47.600 --> 13:48.880
I came here
with someone.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.620
Then they dumped me.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.060
I’ve been trying to hitchhike
back to Paris since.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.810
How come you’re struggling?

13:59.470 --> 14:00.700
With all of…
that.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.640
I wasn’t struggling
for offers.

14:05.240 --> 14:05.800
Just...

14:06.300 --> 14:08.320
Ones that were
worth taking.

14:09.900 --> 14:12.030
What do you wanna
do tonight?

14:13.450 --> 14:14.820
I’ve bought a lot of wine.

14:16.380 --> 14:16.890
Jeez.

14:18.450 --> 14:19.290
What?

14:21.620 --> 14:22.880
You’re relentless.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.960
Nothing else to do.

14:27.020 --> 14:28.930
There’s plenty left to do.

14:29.990 --> 14:30.480
Yeah?

14:32.010 --> 14:33.760
What did you do before?

14:34.840 --> 14:37.180
You really don’t do
anything, do you.

14:39.020 --> 14:40.090
What would you do?

14:40.220 --> 14:42.420
I don’t live in a
fuck off house, do I?

14:44.920 --> 14:46.820
What did you do
back home?

14:47.850 --> 14:48.920
I sing mostly.

14:49.240 --> 14:49.990
And I...

14:50.980 --> 14:53.350
I wrote my songs.

14:55.170 --> 14:56.830
Singer, songwriter.

14:57.160 --> 14:57.880
Player.

14:59.710 --> 14:59.970
Yeah.

15:00.560 --> 15:01.610
I play some guitar.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.200
But I’m the lead singer
in the band.

15:07.650 --> 15:08.340
Do you play?

15:08.920 --> 15:09.160
No.

15:11.180 --> 15:11.730
Nothing?

15:11.910 --> 15:12.180
No.

15:15.280 --> 15:15.970
It’s easy.

15:18.810 --> 15:19.680
If you say so.

15:20.830 --> 15:22.060
Sing something!

15:23.500 --> 15:23.810
Here?

15:25.270 --> 15:25.700
Yeah.

15:28.960 --> 15:29.610
Fuck off.

15:29.610 --> 15:30.742
[laughing]

15:44.670 --> 15:46.170
[music fades out]

16:17.870 --> 16:20.120
In Rwanda, all the Doctors
Without Borders claimed

16:20.140 --> 16:22.080
that the intervention
was a necessity.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.170
But in Sudan,

16:23.620 --> 16:25.830
all the various
aid organizations

16:25.890 --> 16:28.610
were thanked by the
ICC for helping-

16:28.630 --> 16:30.590
Ok hang on, so wait,
you’re saying, ok,

16:30.590 --> 16:32.380
that you’re doing your
humanitarian work,

16:32.420 --> 16:34.340
you’re going into prisons,
helping POWs,

16:34.380 --> 16:38.680
you witness the abuse of
people’s human rights,

16:38.680 --> 16:41.900
and you’re not going to report it or
tell the press about it, what – because

16:41.950 --> 16:43.390
it isn’t the result of a conflict.

16:43.390 --> 16:46.460
Yes, but they would argue that you’d
jeopardise your aid organization’s work

16:46.484 --> 16:46.985
in that country, and probably other countries.

16:46.985 --> 16:47.986
But no, hang on, how can you walk away,
in that country, and probably other countries.

16:47.986 --> 16:48.510
But no, hang on, how can you walk away,

16:48.510 --> 16:48.528
how can you just ignore screams of torture
But no, hang on, how can you walk away,

16:48.528 --> 16:50.070
how can you just ignore screams of torture

16:50.070 --> 16:51.630
and be able to help other people?

16:52.430 --> 16:53.060
I know.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.860
I’m just saying what the
opposition would say.

16:57.030 --> 16:57.530
Sorry.

16:58.900 --> 17:01.030
Sorry, I forget that we’re
on the same team.

17:04.000 --> 17:04.910
[footsteps]

17:05.240 --> 17:06.369
I tried calling!

17:06.420 --> 17:07.290
Hey!

17:13.890 --> 17:14.829
Shall we…

17:15.300 --> 17:15.760
Where?

17:15.859 --> 17:16.900
Just this way.

17:29.030 --> 17:30.140
Just you and mom here?

17:30.730 --> 17:31.860
Mh-hm.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.410
Fucking hell.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.180
Who’s that?

17:55.250 --> 17:57.850
That’s my fiancé,
Charlie.

17:59.470 --> 18:00.590
You’re engaged?

18:02.260 --> 18:03.010
Mh-hm.

18:07.940 --> 18:08.610
You’re old.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.690
What are you
doing tomorrow?

18:15.480 --> 18:16.310
Studying?

18:17.850 --> 18:18.620
All day?

18:23.600 --> 18:24.330
Sit there.

18:29.330 --> 18:31.760
Ok, we mainly do
weddings, so...

18:32.820 --> 18:34.280
Don’t expect too much.

18:34.340 --> 18:36.340
Hold on Sam, just
putting the cymbal on.

18:36.370 --> 18:37.300
Wait one second.

18:38.130 --> 18:39.720
Just do one with
you and me.

18:45.620 --> 18:46.210
Can you sing?

18:46.210 --> 18:48.180
[Mia singing Sale of Sorrow
by Samuel Ford]

18:48.180 --> 18:52.650
[Mia singing]
Forty-three

18:52.710 --> 18:55.890
[Mia singing]
times I lied.

18:57.390 --> 18:59.010
I can’t entertain
you all day.

18:59.250 --> 19:01.320
Well I might not be staying here all day.

19:01.470 --> 19:03.280
Well then you better make the most of it.

19:03.640 --> 19:07.540
[Mia singing]
Crying eyes,

19:08.830 --> 19:10.410
Ok, we’ll do something really easy.

19:10.420 --> 19:12.080
Shall we do B minor, A, E minor?

19:12.080 --> 19:12.920
It’s really heavy.
Shall we do B minor, A, E minor?

19:12.920 --> 19:13.050
Shall we do B minor, A, E minor?

19:13.810 --> 19:14.970
Ok, so you need–

19:14.970 --> 19:16.750
We need three notes,
right?

19:16.880 --> 19:18.170
So put your first finger there.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.380
That’s it.

19:19.500 --> 19:19.860
Nearly.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.016
Yeah, and then the
next note is here,

19:23.040 --> 19:24.180
so that’s an A, so move your finger down.

19:25.110 --> 19:25.890
Aah, so I just move it up?

19:28.060 --> 19:29.060
Oh I just do one.

19:29.350 --> 19:31.060
Yeah just one, open.

19:31.900 --> 19:36.570

Hi, Cynthia.

21:25.930 --> 21:26.800
Mia.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.340
Is Charlie coming?

21:28.470 --> 21:30.930
No, he thinks he might
have to go back,

21:30.930 --> 21:32.180
he says his dad’s worse.

21:32.180 --> 21:33.060

It’s Mia, right?

21:35.730 --> 21:36.190
Yeah.

21:36.230 --> 21:37.520
Would you like a drink?

21:37.980 --> 21:41.190
Yeah, do you want me to
go out and get some wine, or…

21:41.190 --> 21:41.770
No.

21:43.070 --> 21:45.030
Courtesy of work.

from that place.

Ella. Ella.

21:54.540 --> 21:58.170
So he said “Yeah, I wouldn’t mind”,
I figured I’d give it a go.

21:58.460 --> 22:02.420
See if I could use some of
my old, old contacts.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.460
So now you’re
managing him?

22:04.670 --> 22:05.800

Do you like him?

22:07.090 --> 22:08.260

No Mia’s in a band
and they’re really good!

22:22.980 --> 22:26.030
Yeah well. You sold your opinion
on music when you said

22:26.900 --> 22:28.490
“what do I know”.

22:28.490 --> 22:32.740
Well Mia, when I make it
as a music manager,

22:32.740 --> 22:35.120
I’ll sign you to my label.

Do you find yourself
worrying about men, Mia?

23:04.110 --> 23:04.940
No.

23:04.940 --> 23:07.860
I think I should give up
worrying about them.

23:10.740 --> 23:16.080
Ella, you found Charlie and
everything you need.

23:18.700 --> 23:24.460
Security, money, family.
It’s all I want for you.

It’s all I ever wanted.

23:28.510 --> 23:32.470
He’s–
Charlie, he’s just so…

23:33.720 --> 23:36.010
You know Mia, you
know what I mean.

23:36.010 --> 23:40.480
You should share the responsibility
to look after yourself with someone else.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.190
Which is what I
should have done.

23:43.310 --> 23:46.400
But Mia, you’re free.

23:46.400 --> 23:50.400
You can do what you want.
Ella, me, we can’t.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.660
You don’t have the consequences.

23:55.370 --> 24:01.250
You don’t have the weight of
consequences following you around.

24:01.250 --> 24:02.920
That’s freedom!

24:07.090 --> 24:10.380

So now Charlie’s here I think my
mum thinks everything’s sorted.

24:25.610 --> 24:26.770
Why?

24:29.610 --> 24:31.780

I got back late.

what you can’t.

of someone she barely knew.

Did you want her here?

I can wait here
until you tell her.

I don’t know if I can.

46:25.670 --> 46:30.180
even sure grows tired

46:32.680 --> 46:38.900
They won't be forever glad

46:39.230 --> 46:45.990
serving beggars course

46:46.530 --> 46:53.030
You can't be lost forever and

46:57.000 --> 46:58.040
Wait here.

47:02.790 --> 47:04.420
[speaking French]
Alors, la chambre est libre?

47:04.420 --> 47:06.670
[speaking French]
Oui, mais Pierre veut que tu payes maintenant.

47:06.670 --> 47:08.720
[speaking French]
Bien sûr, il sait que c'est moi.

47:09.050 --> 47:10.340
[speaking French]
Ça, c'est l'argent.

47:10.510 --> 47:11.680
[speaking French]
Tu viens quand?

47:11.680 --> 47:13.260
[speaking French]
Ce n'est pas pour moi.

47:17.140 --> 47:18.270
Right, it’s all arranged.

47:19.020 --> 47:20.060
This is your plan?

47:20.230 --> 47:22.270
Yeah, just don’t come by
the house for a few days.

47:30.320 --> 47:31.910
[speaking French[
Bonjour.

47:37.040 --> 47:40.080
I don't know where you are.

47:44.130 --> 47:46.840
I don't know where you are.

47:51.130 --> 47:55.350
I don't know where you are.

47:58.220 --> 48:00.560
I don't know where you are.

48:00.850 --> 48:01.770
Hi!

48:01.770 --> 48:03.770
I’ll just park up by the barn.

48:04.520 --> 48:05.610
Do you want a hand?

48:35.970 --> 48:37.310
Did you want a…

49:20.640 --> 49:22.350
You’re confusing me.

49:23.940 --> 49:26.400
[guitar starts playing]

49:28.820 --> 49:31.480
Since you’ve arrived,
you’ve been confusing me.

49:34.490 --> 49:35.700
No I haven't.

49:36.160 --> 49:37.410
You’ve been quiet.

49:40.790 --> 49:42.450
I buried my father.

49:43.330 --> 49:44.870
You weren’t here.

49:51.670 --> 49:52.710
There’s more.

49:54.630 --> 49:56.590
It’s as if you’re trying
to keep quiet.

49:59.300 --> 50:00.930
Quiet over what?

50:04.310 --> 50:05.520
What’s happened.

50:11.190 --> 50:12.480
To who?

50:14.400 --> 50:15.570
You, me.

50:16.820 --> 50:17.530
Us.

50:27.460 --> 50:29.080
[Ella crying]

50:30.710 --> 50:32.130
[music fades out]

50:33.710 --> 50:34.630
Ella!

50:36.800 --> 50:37.550
Ella!

50:38.970 --> 50:41.760
Tell me why you’re crying!
What’s wrong?

50:42.810 --> 50:46.930
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I just-
I’m sorry, Charlie.

50:46.930 --> 50:48.140
Sorry for what?

50:52.860 --> 50:54.570
Ella, what’s–
Just...

50:55.530 --> 50:56.490
Tell me why. What-

50:57.860 --> 50:59.860
Why are you crying?
Just calm down.

50:59.860 --> 51:03.280
I’m sorry I never–
I never kissed you when I got here.

51:04.870 --> 51:06.450
[Ella crying]

51:08.000 --> 51:11.290
Tell me I’m a good person.

51:11.420 --> 51:15.880
Tell me I’m a good person,
I need to hear you say it.

51:17.220 --> 51:19.380
You are. You are. Shh.

51:19.380 --> 51:21.890
I’m so sorry.
I’m sorry I left you here.

51:25.560 --> 51:26.930
You know you are.

51:46.740 --> 51:48.410
Do you think you could live here?

51:52.920 --> 51:54.630
I have been thinking.

51:56.670 --> 51:57.590
I could see it.

52:06.890 --> 52:07.970
What else?

52:09.180 --> 52:10.230
Me, maybe?

52:12.940 --> 52:13.730
Maybe.

52:16.440 --> 52:17.480
If you wanted.

52:21.820 --> 52:23.110
Would you work?

52:27.160 --> 52:28.660
What would you do?

52:30.750 --> 52:32.080
We’ll grow bored.

52:33.500 --> 52:37.300
If we haven’t had a family by then,
we’ll probably start thinking of having one.

52:38.630 --> 52:40.970
That’s what happened to your dad.

52:43.470 --> 52:44.090
Probably.

52:46.470 --> 52:51.020
What did you talk about,
that last time?

52:53.850 --> 52:54.850
Nothing.

52:58.980 --> 53:00.320
Nothing at all.

54:02.760 --> 54:04.300
Do you want to go on the bed?

54:30.740 --> 54:31.870
Come on top.

56:03.920 --> 56:06.880
[suspenseful music starts]

57:33.888 --> 57:35.389
[phone notification sound]

57:53.030 --> 57:55.030
[gate slams shut, music ends]

57:55.320 --> 57:57.030
[phone notification sound]

58:32.360 --> 58:33.820
[phone text delivery sound]

58:37.530 --> 58:39.110
What have you done
with your hair?

58:39.110 --> 58:40.450
Does it look-

58:44.330 --> 58:45.330
Ow!

58:51.920 --> 58:54.050
Do you mind if I
invite someone over?

58:55.210 --> 58:56.550
Oh I thought we could…

58:58.470 --> 58:59.640
Yeah it’s fine.

59:00.590 --> 59:01.390
You’ll like him.

59:02.760 --> 59:03.680
He's nice.

59:07.890 --> 59:10.350
So how do you guys
know each other?

59:10.980 --> 59:13.520
Oh well, ehm…
well how did you guys meet?

59:13.820 --> 59:17.280
Well it was some…
poetry dinner party.

59:18.450 --> 59:19.950
So like an open mic kinda thing?

59:19.950 --> 59:20.700
Yeah.

59:20.910 --> 59:23.950
And at the end I just told
Ella I was coming with her.

59:39.130 --> 59:41.010
Hey! Where are you going?

59:41.680 --> 59:42.930
Don’t you want to stay?

59:43.930 --> 59:44.760
Stay?

59:52.860 --> 59:54.650
What’s-
What’s going on?

59:55.730 --> 59:57.280
Mia, this isn’t what you promised.

59:57.280 --> 59:58.490
Just the two of us then.

59:58.490 --> 01:00:00.070
I’ve been there before.

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:03.530
Fuck off.

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:05.280
Fuck you!

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:07.160
[slapping sound]
Fuck-

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:07.910
Don’t do that!

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.710
[speaking Swedish]
Ut! Jävla fitta, ut!

01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:11.620
Mia!

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.460
Are you mad?
Who are you trying to impress?

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.500
Me?

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:17.340
Look at yourself.

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:19.340
Face.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.510
Hair.

01:00:21.550 --> 01:00:23.680
It’s a night in with me,
for fuck’s sake.

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:28.470
What were you doing tonight?

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.110
Okay.

01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:42.610
I wasn’t sure what you wanted.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.030
I’m sorry.

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.700
[door closes]

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.140
Get off.

01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:10.890
Have you done it?

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.480
I can come with you.

01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:18.020
We’re not going there.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:19.570
What’s the point in waiting?

01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:20.900
Have you even missed me?

01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:25.990
How can you spend time
with someone like that?

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:27.660
How can you do that?

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:31.290
Am I now allowed to see
you until I tell her?

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:36.580
Mia!

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.210
Fuck!

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.010
Argh!

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:50.140
[engine starts]

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.390
Fucking gearstick!

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.520
Fucker.

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.520
[guitar starts playing]

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:17.620
Fuck!

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.580
You’re actually here.

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.750
I didn’t think you’d actually do it.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.000
Figured you would just hide away.

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.000
I’m here now, for Charlie.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.920
He told me.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.300
You’re not sleeping together.

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:09.010
There’s more to us than that.

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:10.090
Truth?

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.350
Honesty?

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:16.520
Actually knowing the other person
rather than pretending to? Do you have-

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.940
You’re hardly being honest.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.440
To show you what it’s like!

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.560
Living in your own lie! Can’t you see
what you have, isn’t that what we-

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.560
You don’t know what
you’re talking about!

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:29.450
How many times do you ask him
to tell you you’re a good person?

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:33.530
You can’t… You can’t even tell
me what you’ve done with him.

01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:35.120
Go on.

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:37.290
What are you waiting for. Say it.

01:03:37.790 --> 01:03:38.500
Tell me.

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:39.750
Get off!

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.170
[music intensifies]

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:18.660
Mia!

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.000
Mia!

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.080
Mia!

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:21.790
What?

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:23.790
What do you want?

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:24.670
Just wait!

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:26.300
For what?

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:32.550
It’s not easy.

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:37.140
I can’t just say it like you.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.930
What have I said?

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.070
No wait. Look.
I’m not sure! Mia!

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:49.230
You know, I don’t even know
how to look at you!

01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:51.230
Just the way you look
at me right now!

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:57.450
Just the way you look at me
right now is what I want.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.290
Get off! Go and ask him!

01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:01.500
No I’m asking you.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:05.210
Which is it, Mia, did you come
here to ruin his life or mine?

01:05:06.290 --> 01:05:07.460
What about mine?

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:10.420
What about it?
What do you lose in all of this?

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:14.050
What do you lose, Mia?

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:26.900
Where have you been?

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.900
You slept with her, right?

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:32.360
Here, in this house in France,
with me in London.

01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:38.370
Blame it on your dad, blame it on me not being here,
but just tell me. Somebody has to tell me!

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:40.370
Did you sleep with her?

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:46.170
No...

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.760
Oh no...

01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:59.260
I'm sorry.

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.100
Sorry, Ella.

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.810
No. No, Charlie!

01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:03.850
I wanted to tell you-

01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:05.270
You know she’s still here.

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.524
I know. But I wanted to tell you.

01:06:05.524 --> 01:06:06.441
In the village. Oh fuck!
I know. But I wanted to tell you.

01:06:06.441 --> 01:06:07.560
In the village. Oh fuck!

01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:09.060
Ella!

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:10.860
I'm sorry!

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:14.500
Been here a few hours now.

01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:16.170
It's weird.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.560
Being able to think about
everything for that long.

01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:27.680
I never should have stayed there.

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:29.680
Should have...

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:32.610
Been here for you, not for him.

01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:36.780
My mum isn’t talking
to me because of it.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.570
It doesn’t mean that I should-

01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:41.490
I forgive you.

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:45.620
That easily?

01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:51.250
It’s not easy.

01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:57.010
But I can forgive you.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.220
Can love you like I did.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.440
What if I can’t forgive myself, Ella?

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.529
Then I’ll help you.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Did you dad ever talk about us?

01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:41.470
At all?

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.510
Not really.

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:53.729
When my mum first met you,

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:56.189
she called you Prince Charles.

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.319
That is disgusting.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.370
She needs to see you.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.590
Why don’t we go out there?

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.840
What did you say?

01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:24.090
I said why don’t
we go out there?

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.470
Maybe.

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:34.390
Can you shut the door?

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:57.130
Just the way you look at me
right now is what I want.

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:30.400
What about all this bit?

01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:32.320
Just sit still.

01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:34.870
You are a bit bossy.

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:38.500
Do you want a plait or not?

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.750
You’re gonna watch me
cook or help cook?

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:47.500
Well, I can help you,
a little bit.

01:12:48.676 --> 01:12:49.710
Is this your...

01:12:50.170 --> 01:12:51.130
special...

01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:53.640
Your favourite meal?

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.180
Yeah.

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:55.970
No.

01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:00.430
[Ella singing] Take it slow...

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.150
[laughter]

01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:15.660
Say it.

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:16.530
Milla.

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:18.790
[laughter]

01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:19.790
Mizza.

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:20.540
Mitha.

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:21.500
No wait.

01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:23.420
Mizza.

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:24.790
Mizza.

01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:26.790
No, you can’t do it.

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:29.050
It's Mia.

01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:38.390
Tell me I’m a good person.

01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:41.600
Why?

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.060
Just...

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:47.860
You don’t need me
to tell you that.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.950
Tell me that I’m honest.

01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:58.740
You are.

01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:03.580
You’re beautiful, kind,

01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:05.250
Honest.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.090
Say we can be happy.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.800
I’ll stay if you can say that.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:23.770
Get out!
Close the door, get out!

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.220
[plates smash]

01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:16.530
It’s my dad.

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:19.570
I’m not sure if I should be
saying this over voicemail.

01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:21.620
[phone rings]

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:25.500
We’re talking one minute,
and, and then…

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.290
Then we weren’t.

01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:29.210
He’s gone.

01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:33.800
He’s gone.

01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:46.160
Do you want me to help you?

01:16:46.330 --> 01:16:47.740
Yeah, can you take that?

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:49.200
Thanks.

01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:54.540
Have you got your passport?

01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:55.130
Yeah.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:17.440
Charlie.

01:17:24.070 --> 01:17:25.410
No, wait. Wait.

01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:30.290
Tell me.

01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:33.790
What did he last say to you?

01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:36.710
Your dad.

01:17:37.170 --> 01:17:41.510
We never said an honest or sincere
word to one another our entire lives.

01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:46.010
I didn’t think he was
even capable.

01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:54.850
Just before he passed…

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.320
He finally had to admit something.

01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:02.070
Did you?

01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:05.200
He said he never loved
anyone entirely.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.280
Not my mother.

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:10.200
His father.

01:18:10.450 --> 01:18:11.540
Not even me.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.250
I’m so sorry.

01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:14.910
He couldn't.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:15.870
You made me-

01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:17.870
I couldn’t let her carry on a lie!

01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:20.040
Why did you have
to fuck me, huh?

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:22.170
Why did you make me
into something like you?

01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:24.840
I don’t know, I came
here to make sure!

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:29.180
I’m so sorry, Charlie.
Charlie. Charlie, I’m so sorry.

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:31.180
He’d seen me with my grandad.

01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:32.770
With Ella.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:36.100
It didn’t take much, did it.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.810
For you to forgive me.

01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:38.150
I do.

01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:40.400
You’re not in a position to
forgive anyone. You-

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:42.150
How caring I was.

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:42.690
Charlie.

01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:46.110
You begged! You begged me to tell
you that you’re a good person!

01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:46.530
I know!

01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:47.660
You begged!

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.200
She is.

01:18:53.370 --> 01:18:55.580
He didn’t understand
where I’d got it from.

01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:01.170
Unlike him, he realized that I
was capable of showing love.

01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:03.590
I did it for us!

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.550
No! Do not!
Why?

01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:08.220
You have destroyed our lives.

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:09.050
We can still be.

01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:10.720
Why would I, with
somebody like you.

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.180
And that gave him great relief.

01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:17.020
And happiness.

01:19:19.650 --> 01:19:20.560
Ella!

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.120
Ella!

01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:40.040
He was proud.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:43.960
I wonder if he’d take
it all back now.

01:19:46.670 --> 01:19:49.380
[inaudible]

01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:54.720
[inaudible]

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:56.720
[music fades]
