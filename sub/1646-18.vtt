00:01.084 --> 00:02.669
Previously on Prison Break:

00:02.752 --> 00:04.045
I had a deal with the General.

00:04.129 --> 00:05.422
You couldn't just
let me handle this?

00:05.839 --> 00:07.841
If by handle, you mean
give Scylla back to the General,

00:07.924 --> 00:08.925
then no.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.260
I should warn you
I'm going to do everything

00:10.343 --> 00:11.761
in my power to stop you.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.221
I want my life back.

00:13.304 --> 00:14.889
Linc, Mom is alive.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.058
What?

00:17.142 --> 00:18.351
I guess I'll
see you in Miami.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.519
If I give Scylla
back to the General,

00:19.602 --> 00:20.687
he leaves me
and Michael alone,

00:20.770 --> 00:23.690
and I get to spend time
with my son in peace.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.443
What if General Krantz were
no longer in the picture?

00:27.485 --> 00:29.779
What's going on?
Good-bye, Jonathan.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.532
Where are you, Christina?

00:32.615 --> 00:34.701
I don't like your
tone, Jonathan.

00:34.784 --> 00:35.869
Excuse me,

00:35.952 --> 00:38.997
but it's been a while
since anyone's tried to kill me.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.211
The General should know by now

00:45.295 --> 00:46.421
not to mess with us.

00:46.504 --> 00:49.883
The General didn't send me.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.843
Christina is going
to change the Company.

00:51.926 --> 00:52.802
She said after two days

00:52.886 --> 00:54.429
-she would make the change?
-Yeah.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.432
Look at the date on that
laminate. Two days away.

00:57.515 --> 00:58.683
I need to talk to her.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.727
Lincoln's back at the plaza.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.437
I told him to stay away.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.481
We have a clean shot.

01:04.856 --> 01:05.815
Take it.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.069
Take it.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.445
Roger that.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.006
Stevenson rooftop, twelve o'clock.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.777
Where's Christina?!

02:32.861 --> 02:33.820
Where's Christina?!

02:35.029 --> 02:36.072
Somebody call the police!

02:47.750 --> 02:49.961
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.129
Stay in the car.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.135
Where is she?

02:57.927 --> 02:59.304
Where is she?

02:59.387 --> 03:00.513
Where is she?!

03:00.597 --> 03:02.056
We got his phone.
Let's get out of here.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.892
We got to go.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.310
We got to go.
Let's go.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.819
She only uses the place
in the winter, so...

03:16.613 --> 03:18.531
we should be fine
for a while here.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.952
And that's Deb.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.372
Were you guys in college
together, too?

03:28.124 --> 03:30.335
Uh, no,
just medical school.

03:30.418 --> 03:31.878
She's got a practice...

03:34.130 --> 03:35.048
in New York

03:35.131 --> 03:36.466
and she comes down here

03:36.549 --> 03:38.009
once a year
to teach a seminar.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.556
God, good for her.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.691
Nice family photos.

03:54.484 --> 03:58.488
Sand, sun,
cheesy matching outfits.

04:00.698 --> 04:03.785
We could have that
if we wanted... someday.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.595
Stuart, take a seat.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.353
Scylla is in Miami.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.938
Our people are
combing the city as we speak.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.190
Yes, I've heard.

05:57.273 --> 06:00.485
Someone's attempting
a hostile takeover.

06:01.027 --> 06:01.944
Whoever has Scylla

06:02.028 --> 06:04.405
is trying to turn
the cardholders against me.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.157
Oren tried to kill me...

06:06.240 --> 06:07.450
Jonathan...

06:07.533 --> 06:09.535
We're dumping
your cell phone.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.579
We've already found
several phone calls

06:11.662 --> 06:14.332
between you
and an unknown party.

06:16.876 --> 06:21.047
Stuart... who has Scylla?

06:21.130 --> 06:22.465
I don't know.

06:23.966 --> 06:25.009
Think, buddy.

06:26.594 --> 06:27.428
Think.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.806
I swear I don't
know anything.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.100
This can be
as painless

06:32.183 --> 06:33.643
as you want it to be.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.814
Who has Scylla?

06:40.525 --> 06:43.611
You have gone
around the bend on this.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.447
I haven't even started yet.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.332
Come on, Linc, this guy
wasn't trying to hurt you.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.792
He just didn't
like your tattoo.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.086
You're a funny guy, Self.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.254
There's a lot of calls

07:01.337 --> 07:02.922
on the sniper's cell
from a blocked number.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.425
We'll need the Company
to help identify it.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.552
What if it's your
mom's cell phone, Linc,

07:07.635 --> 07:08.928
and we have to
pay a visit?

07:09.011 --> 07:09.971
You got the gumption?

07:17.979 --> 07:19.063
Yeah.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.400
Lincoln, I don't like having
to initiate these calls.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.694
Well don't. We'll call you
when we get it.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.071
Who has Scylla?

07:27.864 --> 07:28.823
We don't know,

07:28.906 --> 07:30.825
but we tangled
with a sniper.

07:30.908 --> 07:34.370
Whom you're interrogating
right now, right?

07:35.663 --> 07:36.706
He's dead.

07:36.789 --> 07:37.915
Lincoln,
the point of this action

07:37.999 --> 07:40.960
is not to kill
as many of them as you can!

07:42.336 --> 07:44.130
Your methods make me question

07:44.213 --> 07:45.840
whether you are capable
of playing

07:45.923 --> 07:47.675
on a field of this size.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.302
We'll get Scylla.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.388
I want answers today.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.477
Aren't you leaving
something out,

07:57.560 --> 07:59.812
something a tad critical,
like it's your mom

07:59.896 --> 08:01.647
who has Scylla, hmm?

08:01.731 --> 08:03.357
Don't think too much.
Let's talk about that.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.067
Let's talk about thinking
too much, okay?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.652
Are you stonewalling
the General 'cause it's good

08:06.736 --> 08:08.321
for the team here,
or are you protecting the woman

08:08.404 --> 08:11.657
who popped you out
lo these many years ago, huh?

08:11.741 --> 08:14.952
If Krantz didn't put
you here, I'd kill you.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.704
All right,
all right!

08:17.371 --> 08:18.289
There's my answer.

08:18.372 --> 08:19.707
If we tell Krantz

08:19.790 --> 08:21.876
that Christina has it, he may
know things that'll help us

08:21.959 --> 08:24.378
or he may determine
that we're no longer useful.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.339
Everybody
understand that?

08:26.422 --> 08:28.341
We're here to get Scylla,
we need Scylla,

08:28.424 --> 08:31.177
and the way to do that
is to stick to the plan

08:31.260 --> 08:32.428
and to keep our mouths shut.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.147
Hey, look at this.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.067
Yesterday he found
us on Interstate 10,

08:46.150 --> 08:49.320
near Route 4, in Arizona.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.822
And "MS" are
your initials.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.825
Yeah, but the rest of this
could mean anything.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.370
I'll do a search on Rockwell
and we'll figure it out.

08:57.453 --> 08:59.413
Assuming Lincoln hasn't already.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.791
He's been here three days

09:01.874 --> 09:03.793
and he's got access
to Company resources.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.212
And once he puts

09:06.295 --> 09:08.089
his mind to something,
that's it,

09:08.172 --> 09:10.383
even if he figures
out he's wrong.

09:12.426 --> 09:13.469
Well, and from
what I've gathered,

09:13.553 --> 09:14.971
he doesn't think he is wrong.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.396
Well, if I'm MS...

09:25.314 --> 09:27.817
who's VS?

09:47.253 --> 09:50.381
Bengali has fourteen
different vowels.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.882
It's a bitch
to pronounce.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.009
Lincoln got away.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.772
Have you ever seen a picture
of a supernova?

10:09.942 --> 10:11.277
I have.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.904
They're quite beautiful,
aren't they?

10:15.031 --> 10:16.782
They're very rare.
They only occur

10:16.866 --> 10:19.076
about once
every fifty years.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.789
We're a day away
from a kind of supernova.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.881
A moment so powerful
it'll eclipse everything.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.926
And nobody's going
to stop me.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.525
No?
They haven't got it yet.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.110
All right, I've sent it twice
already. Either they...

10:53.194 --> 10:54.362
They got it.
They got it. Okay.

10:54.445 --> 10:56.906
We need you to trace
who called the sniper's cell

10:56.989 --> 10:58.658
and tell us
where he is in Miami.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.826
Well, when?

11:00.910 --> 11:03.079
No.
Hell, no. We need it now. We...

11:05.956 --> 11:06.916
Hour earliest.

11:06.999 --> 11:07.958
What do you
mean, hour?

11:08.042 --> 11:09.377
We get him, we
get to Christina.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.962
Damn well almost got our asses
handed to us getting these.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.631
You want to know
what your mama's up to?

11:13.714 --> 11:14.715
let's start there.

11:14.799 --> 11:15.841
These things are
for tomorrow.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.468
I want Scylla today!

11:17.551 --> 11:19.053
Oh, sorry there, Sink.

11:19.136 --> 11:21.097
There I go thinking again.
My bad.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.948
Why?

11:39.156 --> 11:40.825
I'm getting you out of here.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.958
-What is it?
-It's Michael.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.293
He's in Miami, wants to meet.

11:52.336 --> 11:53.379
When?

11:55.464 --> 11:56.757
Never.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.468
I warned him not to come.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.264
Yeah.

12:22.533 --> 12:23.534
Hello, Alex.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.161
Glad to see
you're both in one piece.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.495
Where's my brother?

12:26.579 --> 12:28.038
He's not coming.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.832
So you're working
with him now?

12:29.915 --> 12:31.375
You work for the Company?

12:33.711 --> 12:34.837
Sure. Fine.

12:35.796 --> 12:36.797
Why are you here?

12:36.881 --> 12:37.882
Partly to warn you.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.300
I could have
saved you the trip.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.093
'Cause we're seeing
this thing through.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.636
What do you know?

12:42.720 --> 12:43.888
What do you think
you've walked into?

12:43.971 --> 12:45.222
You tell me.

12:48.559 --> 12:49.685
Your mother.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.896
She has Scylla.

12:51.979 --> 12:52.897
Whoever's going
to get it

12:52.980 --> 12:54.148
has to go through her.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.150
I need to talk to my brother.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.151
He's not coming.

12:57.234 --> 12:58.235
He's a little
too busy trying

12:58.319 --> 13:00.321
to stay alive because your...

13:00.404 --> 13:01.906
because your mother tried
to kill him.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.741
And if you stay here
with some half-baked plan,

13:03.824 --> 13:06.118
she's gonna try
and kill you.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.661
What are you
doing here, Alex?

13:07.745 --> 13:10.456
I'm trying to get some information,
anything that can help.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.333
You need to trust me.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.794
So that you can run back
to the General with it?

13:14.877 --> 13:16.045
Everybody can get

13:16.128 --> 13:17.338
what they want here.
We don't have to chose between

13:17.421 --> 13:18.839
saving our families and
taking down the Company.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.090
We can do both.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.635
How?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.138
I'll know when we get there.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.349
That's why I'm
asking you, please,

13:28.432 --> 13:29.558
trust me.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.646
Now, do you
know anything?

13:33.729 --> 13:34.688
Do you have
anything?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.107
The only thing
I can tell you is

13:37.191 --> 13:39.151
that we're gonna burn
the Company down to the ground,

13:39.235 --> 13:40.820
and that's with
or without you, Alex.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.577
I'm sorry, Michael.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.745
About your mother.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.254
So, the guy
who was posing as a cop

13:58.337 --> 14:01.799
yesterday must have been
working for my mother.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.554
Yeah. Yeah,
I think you're right.

14:06.637 --> 14:07.721
And if he was
following

14:07.805 --> 14:09.598
her instructions,
that means...

14:09.682 --> 14:10.558
Guess that means

14:10.641 --> 14:12.810
she wanted the two of us
transported somewhere.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.773
At least she didn't
want us killed.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.108
I guess I should be grateful.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.320
Does this change anything?

14:24.405 --> 14:25.489
No.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.283
The fact that
she thrived

14:27.366 --> 14:29.326
within the Company,
at the expense of...

14:30.619 --> 14:31.745
everyone else...

14:35.666 --> 14:38.043
makes me want
to take them down even more.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.089
Okay.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.258
Rockwell Avenue, South Miami.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.553
Let's go.

14:54.852 --> 14:57.354
All right, the SIM card
information the Company gave us

14:57.438 --> 14:59.899
said this guy should be
a couple of blocks over.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.109
That'd be the guy who
ordered the hit on you, Linc,

15:02.192 --> 15:03.861
not some pizza delivery boy.

15:03.944 --> 15:04.945
Why don't you just shut up?

15:05.029 --> 15:06.155
All right, listen,
he's stopping.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.323
Lincoln,
you're gonna make a right

15:07.406 --> 15:08.490
about a quarter of a mile up.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.617
What's the location?

15:09.700 --> 15:10.701
I don't know, but it's big.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.810
Whose seal is that?

15:36.894 --> 15:39.313
India. This is the embassy.

15:39.396 --> 15:40.731
All right, there he is.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.486
And look who he's with.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.821
She's got Scylla.
We need to get in there.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.114
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.783
Okay, if she's going in,
she's gonna come back out.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.701
And when she does,
we take our shot.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.370
One thing I learned
at Fox River- just 'cause

15:54.453 --> 15:56.956
something goes in, don't mean
it always comes back out.

15:57.039 --> 15:57.998
You're right.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.166
Hark, what was that?
One more time?

15:59.249 --> 16:00.501
Look, she's got
that thing on her.

16:00.584 --> 16:01.585
We need to move now.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.379
We need to
create a distraction.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.516
Ready to go, T-Bag?

16:15.599 --> 16:19.103
No, no, no, no, no!
What do you, what do you want me to say?

16:19.186 --> 16:20.354
Just run your mouth.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.981
You know how
to do that, right?

16:22.064 --> 16:23.148
Look, when we get in,
we'll let you know.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.608
Until then,
you keep 'em busy.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.485
Figure it out, okay?

16:27.152 --> 16:28.112
Come on, Donnie.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.279
I don't know
about that.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.614
You'll be fine.
Just figure it out.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.119
Excuse me?

16:35.202 --> 16:36.704
Excuse me. I'd like a meeting
with your president, sir.

16:36.787 --> 16:39.289
Uh... could you notify him
I'm here? Thank you.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.458
The president doesn't live
in America, sir.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.543
She lives in Kashmir.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.294
She? Oh, well.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.422
That explains a lot, don't it? Listen,

16:46.505 --> 16:48.382
Haji, I got no beefs
with you, okay?

16:48.465 --> 16:50.843
It's just, there comes a point
when a thinking man

16:50.926 --> 16:52.219
has to take a stand.

16:52.302 --> 16:54.888
You know who else
thinks? Elephants.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.349
That's right. Elephants.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.143
You know, they have
the largest brain

16:59.226 --> 17:00.728
in the whole animal kingdom?

17:00.811 --> 17:01.687
Did you know that?

17:09.445 --> 17:10.904
Come on, Bagwell.

17:10.988 --> 17:12.865
Sir...
You folks have a history

17:12.948 --> 17:15.075
of mistreating
these mighty creatures,

17:15.159 --> 17:16.994
and up till now, no one's
been lifting a finger.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.162
Up till now.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.246
This is private property, sir.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.873
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

17:20.956 --> 17:22.332
Well, I'm not
going anywhere.

17:24.084 --> 17:27.337
Ha!
Unlock those now!

17:27.421 --> 17:29.590
This is station four.
I have a code eleven.

17:29.673 --> 17:31.300
Bring it!

17:31.383 --> 17:33.052
Security camera's looking good.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.636
All right, here we go.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.514
Let's move.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.575
All available guards to the front gate.

18:04.792 --> 18:08.962
Sir? Sir? America's on
the other end of that sidewalk.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.298
You're on international soil.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.300
For your sake, I hope
you brought the keys for that.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.886
I have no-no gripes
with you at all, okay?

18:15.969 --> 18:17.763
I've been calling
my congressman.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.515
I've been writing
United Nations.

18:19.598 --> 18:20.641
I don't care.

18:20.724 --> 18:22.184
Did you know
that elephants eat

18:22.267 --> 18:25.312
over five hundred pounds
of food per day?

18:25.395 --> 18:26.271
And their dung,

18:26.355 --> 18:28.440
it can be... it
can be processed

18:28.524 --> 18:29.650
into parchment.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.735
You're about to be
in a big heap of that, sir.

18:31.819 --> 18:32.820
Elephant!
Front gate now.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.154
Elephant!

18:35.572 --> 18:36.615
Let's go.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.374
All right, let's go.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.626
I'm gonna text Bagwell
and let him know we're in.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.504
All right. After 9/11,
DHS implemented some new

18:50.587 --> 18:52.256
protocol regarding...
Just hurry up.

18:52.339 --> 18:53.841
It's an abomination.

18:53.924 --> 18:54.967
That's what it is.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.844
It's an abomination.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.221
Why, the elephants,
next to the chimps,

18:59.304 --> 19:02.808
have the closest DNA sequence
as us human beings.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.351
Sir, I don't think
that's true.

19:04.434 --> 19:07.146
Excuse me just a second.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.112
Sorry to inconvenience
you guys.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.659
Your ride's here, pal.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.873
Boys... boys, just... just
a little misunderstanding.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.207
They're going to
take you down

19:27.291 --> 19:28.458
to visit your
buddies at the zoo.

19:28.542 --> 19:29.626
Bagwell's in trouble.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.003
Are we made?

19:31.086 --> 19:33.505
We're not waiting around
to find out. Let's go.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.506
We got about ten seconds

19:34.590 --> 19:36.550
before we go live all over
this place. Come on.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.597
All right, here we go.
Let's go.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.612
All right,
it looks good over here.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.696
Clear here.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.783
We got to hurry.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.164
Have you ever seen
the Taj Mahal?

20:08.332 --> 20:10.500
Only in photographs.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.336
You?

20:13.503 --> 20:15.130
Several times.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.300
It was built by the Shah Jahan
for his favorite wife.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.719
I remember telling that
to my ex-husband.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.387
Do you know what his reply was?

20:27.017 --> 20:28.435
That's very sweet,
Christina.

20:28.518 --> 20:29.770
I'm fine, thank you.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.855
Please.
Thank you.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.690
I'm sorry for all
the extra security,

20:33.774 --> 20:35.567
but as I'm sure
you realize,

20:35.651 --> 20:36.610
there's a lot of people

20:36.693 --> 20:38.320
who would like
to get their hands on this.

20:43.075 --> 20:47.204
This is an overview of
the solar cell prototype.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.581
That's just the beginning
of what's on here.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.208
A desalination technique

20:51.291 --> 20:53.335
that can yield
potable water

20:54.503 --> 20:55.921
within seconds.

20:57.547 --> 20:58.882
Bioengineered crops

20:58.966 --> 21:02.552
that will subsist
in the harshest of climates.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.348
Revolutionary vaccines.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.687
Well, you know that there's
a rumor floating about

21:11.770 --> 21:14.940
that this belongs
to General Krantz.

21:17.651 --> 21:20.070
That eight-carat
purple diamond

21:20.153 --> 21:22.906
your lovely wife wears
on her hand.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.449
Did you worry about

21:24.533 --> 21:26.576
which South African country
it was taken from?

21:27.995 --> 21:30.998
The profit margin would
be split fifty fifty.

21:31.081 --> 21:35.002
Your country would handle the
manufacturing and distribution.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.713
I would act as your
silent partner.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.303
Please.
Have a seat.

21:56.189 --> 21:57.983
Last resort. We clear?

21:59.693 --> 22:01.486
No, he's not clear.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.322
We fire off a shot in here,

22:03.405 --> 22:04.656
we're not getting out.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.491
Are we clear?

22:06.575 --> 22:08.118
We're clear.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.454
I sense there's something
that you're not telling me.

22:10.537 --> 22:11.913
All you have to do

22:11.997 --> 22:15.208
is show up at the Progressive
Energies conference tomorrow,

22:15.292 --> 22:16.835
go up on the dais,

22:16.918 --> 22:19.129
and present this
technology as your own.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.130
So, I'm the one

22:20.213 --> 22:22.424
who looks like the fool
if this venture fails.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.843
The leading minds
of this world

22:24.926 --> 22:26.803
will be at that conference
tomorrow,

22:26.887 --> 22:28.805
working on
the crisis

22:28.889 --> 22:31.683
that we are facing
with our planet.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.769
You will have
the solution.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.022
You will be a visionary.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.608
Dr. Vincent Sandinsky

22:39.858 --> 22:41.401
has done extensive research

22:41.485 --> 22:42.652
on the bargain theory.

22:42.736 --> 22:45.489
Says that proof of its
practical application

22:45.572 --> 22:47.657
is pretty shaky.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.993
He's giving a lecture tomorrow
at the conference

22:50.077 --> 22:52.579
and I'd like to make sure
that his findings

22:52.662 --> 22:55.499
don't debunk the foundation
of our project

22:55.582 --> 22:57.709
before we even get
off the ground.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.169
Naveen,

22:59.252 --> 23:01.797
the technology that
I am offering you

23:01.880 --> 23:03.465
will catapult
your country

23:03.548 --> 23:07.052
Fifty years ahead of its time.

23:07.135 --> 23:10.597
Naturally, a few other countries have
expressed some interest.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.182
I'm sure that
they would be happy

23:12.265 --> 23:13.809
to sell you this information

23:13.892 --> 23:16.269
at three times the
price in a few years.

23:16.353 --> 23:17.479
This is all very sudden.

23:17.562 --> 23:18.730
Well, as I
said, I only

23:18.814 --> 23:20.941
acquired this recently.

23:21.942 --> 23:25.278
But I assure you,
it is going to sell.

23:25.362 --> 23:28.782
I came to you first
out of respect to your father.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.791
I will just say
one more thing...

23:37.874 --> 23:41.336
then I will let you
do what you like.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.339
What do you think your father
would have done with this offer?

23:58.562 --> 23:59.771
I need a minute.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.151
And don't worry
about Sandinsky.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.112
He won't be a problem.

24:14.494 --> 24:15.912
This is forty eight Rockwell.

24:17.372 --> 24:19.374
Uh,
we need B23.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.917
Row D.

24:22.043 --> 24:22.919
B.

24:24.629 --> 24:26.339
B23.
This is it.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.361
Fernando was a great influence
on you, huh?

24:48.445 --> 24:50.363
And vice versa.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.049
Here we go.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.015
Car keys.

25:21.394 --> 25:22.687
So, there's
no itinerary,

25:22.771 --> 25:25.607
but we do have a map to
the Everglade Memorial Airport.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.235
And we have a gun.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.114
I've been thinking about this.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.825
"V" and "S"
are someone's initials.

25:35.909 --> 25:38.828
16:30 is 4:30 pm.
military time.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.039
What if our guy wasn't
flying out,

25:41.122 --> 25:43.792
but someone named VS
was flying in.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.262
I found one of our guys.

25:55.345 --> 25:56.638
Good. He'll take us to Christina.

25:56.721 --> 25:58.265
Where are you?
Second floor.

25:58.348 --> 25:59.724
Near the atrium.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.782
Don't move!

26:15.865 --> 26:17.325
Freeze!

26:17.409 --> 26:18.493
Twenty Three,
I have Lincoln Burrows

26:18.577 --> 26:19.953
and two male suspects

26:20.036 --> 26:21.162
in custody.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.965
We need to clear out.

26:33.133 --> 26:34.551
Excuse me?

26:34.634 --> 26:36.469
Lincoln's in the building.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.179
I need to close
this deal.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.890
Preferably without looking
like an amateur.

26:40.974 --> 26:42.017
Handle it.

26:46.187 --> 26:47.188
Get in there.

26:47.272 --> 26:48.648
Move!

26:49.774 --> 26:50.609
Get on your knees,

26:50.692 --> 26:52.027
put your hands
on your head.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.153
Get down.

26:56.364 --> 26:58.283
318.

26:58.366 --> 26:59.784
Understood.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.579
Move an inch

27:02.662 --> 27:04.623
and I won't hesitate
to kill any of you.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.757
I think we've come
to a decision.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.091
You honor your side
of the agreement

27:15.175 --> 27:17.093
and I will do the unveiling
at the conference tomorrow.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.262
That's great news, Naveen.
Great news.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.890
Thank you.
Thank you.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.810
Let's go.

27:36.112 --> 27:37.739
Is there another way
out of here?

27:39.866 --> 27:40.992
Huh?

27:41.076 --> 27:42.786
He just said don't go
near the door.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.079
This is an embassy.

27:44.162 --> 27:44.996
Christina can't risk

27:45.080 --> 27:46.665
an incident,
just like we couldn't.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.793
Nobody's going to kill us.

27:51.378 --> 27:52.712
Let's go.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.759
I don't know how
the hell they found us.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.220
All I care about is Sandinsky.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.305
Is Morris on
his way?

28:02.389 --> 28:03.556
We haven't heard
from him yet.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.141
I'll check his status.

28:07.477 --> 28:08.895
Here, give me that.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.903
Who are you gentlemen with?

28:20.281 --> 28:21.574
Christina.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.202
Here.
She dropped this.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.086
We're about a mile away.

28:36.589 --> 28:37.716
Is that you?

28:37.799 --> 28:39.259
I think it's coming from
inside the briefcase.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.223
Private caller.

28:45.306 --> 28:46.933
Can they track us
on this thing?

28:48.143 --> 28:49.936
Put it on speaker phone.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.023
Hello?

28:56.860 --> 28:58.027
Michael?

29:09.414 --> 29:10.874
Was that your mom?

29:18.423 --> 29:19.924
Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.096
I don't even know
what to say.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.140
There's nothing to say.

29:31.269 --> 29:32.979
Nothing at all.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.242
Jesus, what
happened to you?

29:46.326 --> 29:47.660
Where's Scylla, huh?

29:49.370 --> 29:50.872
They left before
we could get it.

29:52.707 --> 29:54.918
I got the ass kicking
of a lifetime

29:55.001 --> 29:57.045
and you come back
empty-handed?

29:57.128 --> 29:58.213
We got this.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.423
A Post-it note?!

30:00.507 --> 30:02.717
That's what you got?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.135
How about some Elmer's Glue?

30:04.219 --> 30:05.220
Did you get any
of that?

30:05.303 --> 30:06.262
Why don't you calm down.

30:06.346 --> 30:08.014
This is important to us.

30:08.097 --> 30:10.266
If we had just told
the General...

30:10.350 --> 30:11.309
just told the General...

30:11.392 --> 30:13.102
One more time.

30:13.186 --> 30:15.897
Hey, if this guy's
important to Christina,

30:17.524 --> 30:18.900
he's important to us.

30:18.983 --> 30:20.944
Hey, let's call the Company,
get a read on it.

30:21.027 --> 30:21.903
I'll do it.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.973
You all right?

30:50.056 --> 30:52.058
Yeah, I'm good.
I'll be right out.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.867
Whoever VS is,

31:08.950 --> 31:11.828
their plane gets in in
less than thirty minutes.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.372
We need to get our hands
on that flight log.

31:15.164 --> 31:16.249
Okay.

31:23.965 --> 31:24.883
Hi.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.176
Um, sorry,
I notice you have

31:27.260 --> 31:29.846
a sign up there that says
I can learn to fly here.

31:29.929 --> 31:31.514
Do you have a brochure
I could take a look at?

31:31.598 --> 31:33.099
Let me call you back.

31:33.182 --> 31:35.310
Sure, I should have one
around here somewhere.

31:35.393 --> 31:36.811
Thank you.
Sorry.

31:42.525 --> 31:43.568
There you go.

31:43.651 --> 31:44.694
Okay.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.863
"Learn how to fly."
It's perfect!

31:58.666 --> 31:59.667
Michael.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.467
There was an exit
by the bathrooms.

32:07.550 --> 32:08.551
I need thirty seconds.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.969
They will kill us
if they find us.

32:10.053 --> 32:13.806
Vincent Sandinsky.
VS... N727MG.

32:15.350 --> 32:16.643
Let's go.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.149
Got it.

32:23.232 --> 32:25.151
Vincent Sandinsky's
on a plane right now.

32:25.234 --> 32:27.487
He's heading into
Everglade Memorial Airport.

32:27.570 --> 32:28.780
We got fifteen minutes

32:28.863 --> 32:30.156
to get to Fort Lauderdale.

32:30.239 --> 32:32.200
With traffic, there's no
way we're going to make it.

32:32.867 --> 32:33.868
Then stay.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.167
Excuse me, can I help you?

32:41.250 --> 32:42.627
Funny you should ask.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.087
I need you to call up
to the tower

32:44.170 --> 32:46.839
with a message for N727MG.

32:49.509 --> 32:50.843
N727MG.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.261
This is Everglade Memorial
tower.

32:52.345 --> 32:54.013
We just got word
from another craft

32:54.097 --> 32:56.265
that your port side turbine's
trailing black.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.646
Tower, I'm clear across
the board here.

33:01.771 --> 33:02.855
Am I still good for landing?

33:02.939 --> 33:04.607
Now tell them he
needs to land

33:04.691 --> 33:05.733
at the north end
of the tarmac

33:05.817 --> 33:07.193
and follow emergency
protocol.

33:07.276 --> 33:08.611
-But that'll--
-Tell them.

33:09.862 --> 33:11.364
Do you copy?

33:13.700 --> 33:15.743
Tower, this is operations.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.954
Have November-Seven-

33:18.037 --> 33:21.666
Two-Seven-Michael-Golf approach
from the southwest.

33:21.749 --> 33:23.167
We're not gonna
take any chances.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.586
We're gonna send
a crew out to them.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.505
Have the passengers evac
as soon as they hit the ground.

33:27.588 --> 33:29.173
Roger that.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.842
Now call down to security.

33:30.925 --> 33:34.262
Tell them Dr. Sara Tancredi
needs to be let on the tarmac.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.724
One of your passengers has had
a heart attack.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.892
He needs immediate assistance.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.480
Security, this is operations.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.047
Okay.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.298
One more minute,

34:10.381 --> 34:11.591
and I'll be out
of your hair.

34:12.008 --> 34:13.342
Hey.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.595
You could be getting
in big trouble

34:15.678 --> 34:17.055
for this, guy.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.098
You could go to prison.

34:19.182 --> 34:20.349
Which one?

34:45.500 --> 34:46.876
Something's going on here.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.725
Vincent Sandinsky?

35:03.559 --> 35:04.560
Yes?

35:04.644 --> 35:05.770
Hi. Dr. Tancredi.

35:05.853 --> 35:07.605
-Sir, I need you to come with me.
-Is there something wrong?

35:07.688 --> 35:10.191
Uh, we have some concerns
about some health exposure

35:10.274 --> 35:12.527
you may have experienced
during the flight.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.487
I'm sorry, I don't--
Let's go.

35:14.570 --> 35:15.947
Michael Scofield,
Vincent Sandinsky.

35:16.030 --> 35:18.491
Get in the car.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.077
Why...
Back seat.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.453
Get in!

35:32.255 --> 35:33.214
Please...

35:33.297 --> 35:34.632
don't hurt me.

35:34.715 --> 35:35.716
I won't.

35:37.760 --> 35:38.719
But they will.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.396
You can take
everything I have.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.273
Just... please let me go.

35:54.610 --> 35:56.737
Do you know who Christina Scofield is?

35:56.821 --> 35:57.864
Who?

35:57.947 --> 35:58.823
No.

36:04.036 --> 36:05.371
Michael, I'm running out of road.

36:05.454 --> 36:06.747
Head for those hangars.

36:17.466 --> 36:20.094
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.846
What's going
on here?

36:21.929 --> 36:23.055
Get out of the car!

36:23.139 --> 36:24.432
Now!

36:25.016 --> 36:26.559
Michael?

36:26.642 --> 36:28.686
-Oh, my God, oh, my God.
-Move it!

36:28.769 --> 36:29.896
Move it!

36:29.979 --> 36:31.731
Before they kill us,
let's just do what they want.

36:31.814 --> 36:34.942
Let's just do what they want
before they kill us, please.

36:37.486 --> 36:38.905
Get down.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.573
Get down now!

36:41.157 --> 36:42.491
Now.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.369
Put him in
the car.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.582
What do we do
with these two?

36:49.665 --> 36:50.541
Kill them.

37:17.568 --> 37:18.694
You okay?

37:18.778 --> 37:19.862
Yeah.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.572
Thanks to you,
I guess. Hey.

37:22.156 --> 37:23.115
Get out.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.283
Here, move it.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.035
Where are you taking me?

37:26.118 --> 37:27.119
What's going on?

37:27.203 --> 37:29.455
Wh-Wh-Where are you
taking me?

37:29.538 --> 37:30.790
What do you want
to do with me?

37:30.873 --> 37:32.792
Come on, stop talking
and start walking.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.126
This is a mistake.

37:34.210 --> 37:36.379
Lincoln, have you
lost your mind?

37:38.381 --> 37:39.757
Just get in the car, Now!

37:40.758 --> 37:41.884
What are you gonna do?

37:42.885 --> 37:44.595
Shoot me?

37:44.679 --> 37:46.681
I warned you not to come,
Michael.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.225
I'm doing this for us,
our family.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.352
Well, it's not over.

37:52.395 --> 37:53.729
Not by a long shot.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.029
What?

38:43.112 --> 38:46.198
I... got some information
for you.

38:46.282 --> 38:47.700
Now, I want to make sure
that everything

38:47.783 --> 38:50.786
we talked about
is still heading my way.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.872
The car, the office

38:52.955 --> 38:53.998
and the house.

38:54.081 --> 38:55.791
Bagwell, if you're
jerking me around...

38:56.709 --> 38:58.961
You trying to
talk me out of it?

38:59.587 --> 39:00.796
Just tell me.

39:08.846 --> 39:10.598
Linc and Michael's mother.

39:11.974 --> 39:13.476
She's got Scylla.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.686
Here in Miami.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.646
And, General--

39:18.064 --> 39:19.398
Fuel the jet.

39:20.149 --> 39:21.525
We're going to Miami.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.445
Christina Rose Scofield.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.364
That name mean anything
to you?

39:27.114 --> 39:28.407
No.

39:28.491 --> 39:30.242
Then why was she holding on
to your flight information?

39:31.911 --> 39:33.079
I have no idea.

39:33.162 --> 39:35.164
-You ever heard of the Company?
-No.

39:35.247 --> 39:36.332
-The Company!
-You never heard of the Company?

39:36.415 --> 39:37.666
You ever heard of Scylla?

39:40.044 --> 39:41.504
What do you do for a living?

39:43.005 --> 39:44.507
I'm a professor at Dartmouth.

39:45.341 --> 39:46.717
What are you doing in Miami?

39:47.968 --> 39:50.971
I, uh... I just wanted
to get out of New Hampshire

39:51.055 --> 39:52.431
for a few days.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.266
To be honest, right now...

39:54.892 --> 39:56.268
I wish I hadn't.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.271
Just relax.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.607
I got a call from the
organizing committee

40:01.690 --> 40:03.567
of the Progressive Energies
conference that's here tomorrow.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.945
They said they
would fly me out

40:06.028 --> 40:07.571
and put me up in a hotel

40:07.655 --> 40:10.408
if I gave a
short presentation.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.743
Where's your cell?

40:15.579 --> 40:18.374
Uh... it's-it's in my jacket.

40:27.049 --> 40:28.342
Why are you lying to me?

40:28.426 --> 40:29.510
I had it
when I got off the plane.

40:29.593 --> 40:30.719
I swear to God.

40:34.807 --> 40:35.933
Yeah, Michael,
he said he doesn't

40:36.016 --> 40:37.560
know your mom,
but there's got to be

40:37.643 --> 40:40.646
twenty e-mails back and
forth between them.

40:41.897 --> 40:42.898
They don't just
know each other.

40:42.982 --> 40:45.192
They're working
together.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.694
The question is, on what?

40:52.032 --> 40:53.033
Linc.

40:59.665 --> 41:01.041
Vincent Sandinsky.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.216
What about the last number
dialed there?

41:09.300 --> 41:11.260
There's a lot of calls
from that number.

41:14.346 --> 41:15.389
I'll be right back.

42:10.277 --> 42:11.278
Anything?

42:11.362 --> 42:12.655
Not yet.

42:14.406 --> 42:17.826
Good, good, good, good, good.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.831
Yes?

42:22.915 --> 42:25.084
How badly do you
want him, Mom?

42:27.336 --> 42:29.505
Michael, listen to me.

42:29.588 --> 42:31.006
That's not an answer.

42:31.757 --> 42:33.092
I'll be in touch.

42:41.267 --> 42:43.686
His story checks out.

42:43.769 --> 42:44.979
Listen, there are still
some things

42:45.062 --> 42:46.855
we need to figure out,
but as soon as we do,

42:47.398 --> 42:48.899
we'll let you go.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.067
Thank you.
