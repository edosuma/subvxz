00:08.268 --> 00:10.719
<i>My name
is melinda gordon.</i>

00:10.777 --> 00:16.226
<i>I'm married, I live in a small town,
and I own an antique shop.</i>

00:16.318 --> 00:18.318
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

00:18.329 --> 00:22.404
<i>Except that from the time I was a little
girl, I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

00:23.486 --> 00:26.374
<i>Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.</i>

00:26.810 --> 00:29.277
<i>They're stuck here because they
have unfinished business with the living</i>

00:29.313 --> 00:31.801
<i>and they come to me
for help.</i>

00:34.755 --> 00:40.037
<i>In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.</i>

00:48.552 --> 00:50.416
H- help me.

00:50.416 --> 00:54.761
Can you get me out of here?
Can anybody hear me?

00:54.763 --> 00:56.813
I can hear you.

00:57.334 --> 00:59.181
And I know
your secret.

00:59.902 --> 01:01.317
What secret?

01:01.515 --> 01:05.391
That you are seriously in touch
with your inner child.

01:05.425 --> 01:07.303
What can I say?
Easily amused.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.173
No, I love that
about you.

01:09.176 --> 01:12.440
You know, large shoes,
big, red nose, and I'm all set.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.591
- Where did ned go?
- Hey, houdini.

01:14.635 --> 01:16.483
How about making
an appearance?

01:16.517 --> 01:18.321
You said I wouldn't
have to stay.

01:18.326 --> 01:19.970
Yeah. I also said...

01:20.246 --> 01:22.801
that you would
have to explain why.

01:22.836 --> 01:25.103
I have a really important
math project due tomorrow.

01:25.106 --> 01:28.801
I was actually counting on another
pair of hands today.

01:29.195 --> 01:31.923
Will these do?
I'll stay.

01:32.027 --> 01:33.813
I hope you're
not upset.

01:33.816 --> 01:35.490
As long as you're
ok with it.

01:35.497 --> 01:37.621
Cool. Thanks, mom.
Thanks, melinda.

01:37.935 --> 01:41.001
If he even cracks a "c"
on this project,

01:41.055 --> 01:44.131
I can live with getting
a "c" on my parenting.

01:44.135 --> 01:46.271
So, what do you
need me to do?

01:46.278 --> 01:49.591
Close up.
We're going shopping.

01:51.000 --> 01:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:02.006 --> 02:05.372
...This place for the last 20 years
I never thought I'd have to leave.

02:05.386 --> 02:06.893
Business is that slow?

02:06.897 --> 02:09.550
Ever since eba
dead as a doornail.

02:09.565 --> 02:12.771
Well, you could sell
your stuff online, too, or...

02:13.578 --> 02:15.861
get somebody else to do it
and sell your stuff

02:15.868 --> 02:17.491
from the comfort
of your own home.

02:17.498 --> 02:21.070
Aw, nah. I'm too much of a people
person. I'd miss talking to folks.

02:21.077 --> 02:23.233
Melinda, you have
to look at these.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.730
See what I mean?

02:26.567 --> 02:29.560
Oh. I didn't know
that I had put those out.

02:29.567 --> 02:30.861
Are these not for sale?

02:30.865 --> 02:33.913
Uh, n-no. No, they're for sale.
Everything must go.

02:33.917 --> 02:36.690
I can understand why you
wouldn't want to part with them.

02:36.698 --> 02:37.800
They're gorgeous.

02:37.816 --> 02:39.650
Wow. Hand-painted
on the front.

02:39.658 --> 02:40.852
Are they
christmas ornaments?

02:40.856 --> 02:42.401
Oh, well, could be,
or whatever you like.

02:42.407 --> 02:44.872
If you don't get these, I'm gonna
get them for the store myself.

02:44.877 --> 02:46.293
Ok, I'll take them.

02:47.058 --> 02:49.813
You have a good eye, delia. You can go
shopping with me anytime you want.

02:49.818 --> 02:52.230
Oh, you're gonna be
sorry you said that.

03:54.045 --> 03:55.890
So where do you
want me to put these?

03:55.928 --> 03:57.740
Oh, we don't
have to do that now.

03:58.085 --> 03:59.131
Are you kidding?

03:59.166 --> 04:01.510
I haven't been this jazzed
since I sold my first house.

04:01.556 --> 04:03.990
Seems like
a thousand years ago.

04:10.368 --> 04:12.472
And please don't tell ned.

04:12.476 --> 04:16.680
I want him to think that covering his
hours was a huge sacrifice for me.

04:30.716 --> 04:33.102
you know what?
I think this shelf isn't level.

04:33.136 --> 04:35.500
You wanna put a piece of
wood right underneath this leg.

04:35.545 --> 04:38.900
You know, maybe we could just keep
the ornament in the box for now.

04:38.906 --> 04:40.753
P.O.P.- "Point of purchase. "

04:41.286 --> 04:46.881
You always wanna put some out front
where everyone can see them.

04:47.666 --> 04:49.720
- I'll think about that.
- That's the point.

04:49.966 --> 04:51.833
You don't wanna think.
You just wanna buy.

04:51.865 --> 04:54.041
Can you just
put them back, please?

04:55.476 --> 04:56.561
S- sure.

04:56.578 --> 04:58.161
I didn't mean to-

04:58.205 --> 05:00.311
it's just sometimes
when I have new things,

05:00.318 --> 05:03.790
I like to hold off on putting them out
until I'm really sure where they're going.

05:03.796 --> 05:05.320
I understand.

05:22.976 --> 05:25.590
Melinda, I am so sorry.
I just...

05:25.927 --> 05:27.561
get carried away
sometimes.

05:27.565 --> 05:30.582
Me, too. I guess I'm
just a little on edge.

05:30.867 --> 05:33.023
I know it's not easy
being your own boss.

05:33.027 --> 05:35.751
I used to think that I was
gonna open up my own place,

05:35.787 --> 05:37.680
have a little store
like this one.

05:38.077 --> 05:43.461
I was either gonna call it delia's
decorations or the curbside curator.

05:43.465 --> 05:45.521
And why didn't you?

05:45.936 --> 05:49.602
I got married, I had ned,
and then the concept

05:49.605 --> 05:52.903
of someday just becomes
a little more abstract.

05:53.446 --> 05:55.821
Uh, how did you
get into real estate?

05:57.716 --> 05:59.420
When my husband died.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.442
I had to think of
a plan "b" in a hurry.

06:02.447 --> 06:04.950
There's no time to grow
a small business.

06:04.967 --> 06:07.320
I had to get out there
and make some money, so...

06:07.326 --> 06:08.681
got my real estate license.

06:08.685 --> 06:13.171
Could you grab some newspapers
and maybe check for estate sales?

06:13.178 --> 06:14.812
Sure. No problem.

06:15.385 --> 06:18.021
As soon as you can,
before they run out.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.552
On my way.
Want anything else?

06:20.566 --> 06:22.950
- No. Thanks.
- Ok.

06:43.556 --> 06:45.470
Who are you?

06:47.976 --> 06:49.843
What's going on?

06:50.516 --> 06:54.133
What's happening?
Talk to me. I can help.

06:56.718 --> 07:00.042
Stop it.
Don't do that.

07:00.046 --> 07:02.923
Just please stop it.

07:08.627 --> 07:13.802
Please. Stop it!
Aah! Stop! Please.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.163
Can you see me?

07:54.015 --> 07:58.140
So you can see and hear this ghost,
but he can't see or hear you?

07:58.155 --> 08:00.591
Yeah. How's that for
a cruel twist of fate?

08:00.605 --> 08:03.131
Maybe this ghost
is deaf and blind.

08:03.138 --> 08:05.461
It's like
he's trapped here,

08:05.467 --> 08:07.631
being tormented by these
christmas ornaments.

08:07.638 --> 08:09.382
Not everybody likes
the holidays.

08:09.385 --> 08:12.860
He's definitely trying to get rid of
them. It's like they're alive, breathing.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.733
I've never seen
anything like it.

08:15.185 --> 08:16.841
Where are they now?

08:19.586 --> 08:21.733
Well, I was hoping
the answer was hidden,

08:21.737 --> 08:24.370
you know, deeply away
somewhere in the store.

08:26.115 --> 08:29.541
- Well, they're pretty.
- I wish you could see this.

08:36.438 --> 08:37.799
<i>Let me hold you.</i>

08:38.316 --> 08:40.373
<i>- Can't I touch you?
- No!</i>

08:40.416 --> 08:42.441
<i>Don't do that.
No. Stop it!</i>

08:42.466 --> 08:44.971
<i>Leave me alone!
No. Stop it!</i>

08:47.548 --> 08:50.250
Come on.
Keep breathing.

08:50.286 --> 08:53.212
- Stand up. You're all right.
- What happened?

08:53.218 --> 08:55.981
You tell me. You just
blacked out there for a while.

08:55.988 --> 09:01.352
I- I felt scared and really angry.
It was overwhelming.

09:01.397 --> 09:03.351
- Maybe you should sit down.
- No, I don't think I can.

09:03.358 --> 09:05.191
I should walk it off.

09:06.926 --> 09:10.933
- Did you see anything?
- Yeah, I did. 2 people hitting each other

09:10.937 --> 09:12.702
and some kind
of fight.

09:24.577 --> 09:27.451
Ok, I want this ghost
out of here.

09:35.447 --> 09:37.883
If the ghost wants
to destroy these ornaments,

09:37.966 --> 09:40.791
he can't do it himself,
fire is the best way

09:40.797 --> 09:42.880
that I know to destroy
something made of wood.

09:42.887 --> 09:45.033
If I do it for him,
he can cross over.

10:04.176 --> 10:07.912
- Is he gone?
- Yes.

10:09.336 --> 10:10.870
Come on.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.961
Oh, I am so hungry.

10:22.646 --> 10:24.262
Ey're back.

10:39.497 --> 10:41.002
So is he.

10:58.286 --> 10:59.782
Professor payne?

10:59.825 --> 11:05.751
- Professor payne.
- Go away!

11:05.757 --> 11:08.650
I changed my mind!
No student office hours today!

11:08.655 --> 11:11.761
I'm not a student. It's melinda
gordon. You helped me before.

11:11.765 --> 11:13.810
Ow! Note to self-

11:14.108 --> 11:16.023
stop helping people.

11:16.036 --> 11:17.381
What are you looking for?

11:17.386 --> 11:19.482
Well, before I hit my head, I was
looking for my lunch.

11:19.483 --> 11:20.863
It's in a paper bag.

11:20.864 --> 11:23.801
Oh. Brown-bagging lunch.
That doesn't sound like you.

11:23.802 --> 11:27.465
Ms. Gordon. All right.
What do you have for me, huh?

11:27.465 --> 11:29.083
Bunch of ambiguous
questions that you probably

11:29.086 --> 11:31.482
- already know the answers to?
- You give me too much credit.

11:31.486 --> 11:33.641
Maybe not enough credit. Hmm?

11:33.645 --> 11:35.410
In your studies,
have you ever come across

11:35.415 --> 11:38.600
a situation where a spirit can
make an object appear in our world?

11:38.607 --> 11:40.930
- Materialization?
- I guess.

11:40.935 --> 11:43.410
What I'm talking about is an
object that the spirit can see

11:43.427 --> 11:45.342
and touch and that we
can see and touch, too.

11:45.345 --> 11:47.523
Let's hope it's jewelry
and cash then, huh?

11:47.536 --> 11:48.971
Yes or no?

11:48.977 --> 11:52.201
Look, I've heard of it,
but I don't believe it.

11:52.205 --> 11:55.172
- And why not?
- Because I don't believe in ghosts!

11:55.176 --> 11:57.411
How can you study this stuff
and not believe in it?

11:57.416 --> 11:59.222
I don't study the stuff,
ms. Gordon.

11:59.225 --> 12:02.613
I- I study people's need
to believe in the stuff,

12:02.615 --> 12:05.342
people like you standing
in front of me, looking...

12:05.837 --> 12:09.910
Looking beautiful. And smelling delicious
is what- that perfume, is that french?

12:09.917 --> 12:11.281
Let me smell it.

12:11.285 --> 12:16.262
Ok, let's just assume for a minute that
spirits exist and they can move objects.

12:16.268 --> 12:18.450
Yeah. They called apports.

12:18.455 --> 12:20.821
It's from the french word
apporter. It means "to bring. "

12:20.827 --> 12:21.801
Bring what?

12:21.817 --> 12:25.593
More of that perfume you're wearing,
'cause seriously, it's making me bananas.

12:25.596 --> 12:27.801
I'm kidding.
Unless I'm not.

12:30.597 --> 12:33.461
Ok, I'm kidding.
Um, it brings clarity,

12:33.468 --> 12:35.370
deeper understanding,
aside from the literal,

12:35.377 --> 12:37.341
you know, interpretation
that an apport

12:37.345 --> 12:39.460
is sent from beyond
to the living,

12:39.466 --> 12:42.813
maybe it's a manifestation
of something that's so important,

12:42.815 --> 12:44.591
you know, something
really symbolic.

12:44.595 --> 12:47.162
So if a ghost couldn't talk,

12:47.167 --> 12:50.553
they would maybe make an object
appear as a way of communicating.

12:50.557 --> 12:54.103
- And can these apports move on their own?
- Yeah, and cats can water-ski.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.372
- Is that why they glow?
- Cats don't glow!

12:56.385 --> 12:58.381
- Apports.
- I know you're talking about apports!

12:58.388 --> 12:59.780
- Why are you yelling?!
- I'm not yelling.

12:59.787 --> 13:02.230
I'm yelling, right?!
I make that mistake.

13:02.237 --> 13:04.720
I'm sorry.
I tend to disassociate.

13:04.725 --> 13:07.403
- That's an understatement.
- Wh-what do you want?

13:07.405 --> 13:09.870
Why are you here?
Do you have an apport at home,

13:09.878 --> 13:12.550
and it's just glowing
with ghostly energy? Whoo!

13:12.557 --> 13:15.753
Well, if that's true, why don't you
bring it in so we can test it?

13:18.118 --> 13:19.900
Why would I have
an apport?

13:19.908 --> 13:22.562
I mean, there's no such thing.
It's make-believe, right?

13:29.066 --> 13:35.210
Ah. You... you baffle me!
You little minx.

13:42.396 --> 13:44.470
Aw, I had a feeling
you'd be back.

13:44.476 --> 13:48.293
- Really?
- I know a repeat customer when I see one.

13:48.296 --> 13:51.233
- Still got a few things left.
- Any more ornaments?

13:51.248 --> 13:53.601
No, don't worry.
You've got the only ones.

13:53.606 --> 13:55.880
I was hoping you could tell me
where you got them.

13:55.896 --> 13:58.433
- Why?
- In case they have any more.

13:58.437 --> 14:00.650
Well, I doubt
that there are.

14:00.657 --> 14:02.671
Yeah. Pretty unique.

14:02.678 --> 14:04.502
Well, I don't know
where they came from.

14:04.506 --> 14:08.233
If I did, I'd let you know. Now, if you
excuse me, I gotta get back to my packing.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.653
Maybe the ornaments just
appeared out of nowhere.

14:14.987 --> 14:18.401
How do you mean
"just appeared"?

14:18.828 --> 14:21.033
Last night, a set of ornaments
just like the ones

14:21.036 --> 14:25.002
that you sold me just appeared
on my kitchen table.

14:26.156 --> 14:29.032
- I thought I was going crazy.
- You're not.

14:29.037 --> 14:31.882
I racked my brain
trying to remember

14:31.885 --> 14:34.641
if I picked 'em up
from someone yesterday

14:34.646 --> 14:37.130
or if I saw someone
drop 'em here at the stall.

14:37.145 --> 14:39.652
What about a man
in his mid-thirties,

14:39.658 --> 14:43.353
um, short, brown hair,
stubble, pale skin,

14:43.356 --> 14:46.242
a little disheveled,
doesn't like to look you in the eye?

14:46.247 --> 14:50.162
Shifty I tend to remember,
but no, no, he's not ringing a bell.

14:50.168 --> 14:52.652
If I see anybody like that,
I'll let you know.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.152
Please.

14:57.347 --> 15:00.772
Melinda...
Wait.

15:04.388 --> 15:06.383
I just found this.

15:09.956 --> 15:11.700
- I'll buy it from you.
- Uh, no, no, no.

15:11.708 --> 15:14.670
Y- you take it.
I- I think you should have it.

15:35.808 --> 15:37.101
Ok.

16:46.166 --> 16:48.833
I need your real-estate
expertise to find this house.

16:48.838 --> 16:50.702
It sounds like
an amazing house,

16:50.705 --> 16:52.180
but you don't remember
where it is?

16:52.186 --> 16:54.542
Uh, I've never been.
A client of mine told me about it.

16:54.557 --> 16:56.491
He can't remember
the address?

16:56.738 --> 16:59.522
He's not from around here.
Is he looking to buy?

16:59.525 --> 17:00.886
Do I have a shot?

17:00.886 --> 17:03.800
Uh, I'm not so sure
he could swing a mortgage,

17:03.805 --> 17:06.213
but he's got me curious.
I'd love to see it.

17:06.214 --> 17:08.301
This is the website
that tracks

17:08.305 --> 17:10.643
all of the residential
properties in the area.

17:10.646 --> 17:12.680
You can go ahead and
use my account number

17:12.685 --> 17:14.362
and just put in as many
details as you can

17:14.367 --> 17:16.922
and then search the database
and see if you find the house.

17:17.026 --> 17:20.031
If you convince him to buy,
will you steer him my way?

17:20.127 --> 17:21.532
Thank you.

17:27.477 --> 17:30.683
Well, at least now the ghost
is, uh, communicating with you.

17:30.688 --> 17:32.310
Oh, yeah.
We're like this.

17:32.315 --> 17:35.670
He won't talk to me, look at me,
or even acknowledge my presence.

17:35.678 --> 17:38.872
Well, you did say it takes some
longer than others to adjust to death.

17:38.877 --> 17:41.113
Yeah. Everybody deals
with death differently.

17:41.116 --> 17:43.871
I think delia's having
a hard time with it.

17:44.076 --> 17:45.820
Oh, yeah?
Did you talk to her?

17:45.827 --> 17:49.713
I've been meaning to, but I
haven't really had the chance. Oh.

17:50.658 --> 17:53.982
That's it.
That's the house.

18:40.216 --> 18:44.003
Hello?
Is anybody home?

18:45.927 --> 18:47.592
Hello.

18:57.798 --> 18:59.481
Hello.

19:10.287 --> 19:11.863
Miss.

19:43.278 --> 19:44.873
Give me a minute.

19:45.605 --> 19:48.261
- She ok?
- Physically, she's fine.

19:48.268 --> 19:50.921
She's just completely withdrawn.
She won't talk.

19:50.956 --> 19:52.822
Sounds like
somebody else I know.

19:54.477 --> 19:56.343
The woman's
christine nelson.

19:56.345 --> 19:58.630
Found her picture I.D. Inside.
And he's, um-

19:58.636 --> 20:01.920
well, he was dennis hightower.
I don't know if that does you any good.

20:01.966 --> 20:03.900
Something terrible must have
happened in this house.

20:03.946 --> 20:05.693
I mean, do you remember
the first vision I had?

20:05.697 --> 20:08.462
- 2 people fighting.
- I have to get him to talk to me.

20:08.466 --> 20:09.810
Look, you found his body.

20:09.817 --> 20:12.571
Maybe that's all he needed to
resolve before he could cross over.

20:12.577 --> 20:14.522
But he's still here.

20:14.538 --> 20:17.341
Yeah, well, the police
will be, too, so...

20:31.657 --> 20:33.623
Dennis Hightower.

20:34.965 --> 20:37.900
Are you surprised that
I found out your name?

20:37.905 --> 20:40.780
- Your name?
- Melinda.

20:40.915 --> 20:43.102
It's really nice
to meet you.

20:43.656 --> 20:45.802
Everything's
gonna be ok now.

20:45.807 --> 20:48.183
We found your body.
You can cross over.

20:48.246 --> 20:51.062
All you have to do
is go into the light.

20:54.506 --> 20:56.661
Dennis, can you
see the light?

20:57.795 --> 21:01.991
- You see the light?
- No. I can'T. Only you can.

21:05.378 --> 21:07.490
Is there something else
that you need?

21:08.585 --> 21:11.682
Something that
I can help you with?

21:11.686 --> 21:13.771
Tell me
what happened to you.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.832
What happened to you.

21:16.788 --> 21:18.970
You know that
you're dead, right?

21:19.237 --> 21:21.072
- Right.
- Who did this to you?

21:21.076 --> 21:25.450
- You. You.
- Why don't you understand me?

21:25.458 --> 21:27.223
Understand me.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.872
Coroner's report says it looks
like dennis was poisoned.

21:32.877 --> 21:35.031
Why didn't he
tell me about that?

21:35.035 --> 21:37.041
Maybe I'd be better off if I
talked to christine.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.192
Let the police do that.

21:38.196 --> 21:40.102
I mean, he obviously
led me to her for a reason.

21:40.107 --> 21:41.911
She might be
an important part of his life.

21:41.916 --> 21:43.922
She might be an
important part of his death.

21:44.425 --> 21:45.863
No. You think?

21:46.877 --> 21:49.141
Dennis and christine
might be the 2 people you saw

21:49.148 --> 21:50.542
fighting in your vision.

21:50.546 --> 21:53.211
Why would she poison dennis
and then stay with the body?

21:53.217 --> 21:54.593
Guilty don't always
run and hide.

21:54.596 --> 21:56.333
Maybe dennis led
you to the house

21:56.337 --> 21:59.063
not to help christine, but
to help you find his killer.

21:59.067 --> 22:01.221
Why didn't he
cross over?

22:02.166 --> 22:04.680
You're right. You should
try and talk to christine.

22:09.738 --> 22:11.062
Do you have
an appointment?

22:11.066 --> 22:14.980
No. I'm, uh, looking for a patient,
christine nelson.

22:14.988 --> 22:17.980
The emergency room at mercy hospital
told me that she was taken here.

22:17.986 --> 22:20.111
- This morning.
- And why was she moved?

22:20.117 --> 22:21.882
Too many heads,
not enough beds.

22:21.886 --> 22:24.640
If your condition isn't serious,
life-threatening, or fatal,

22:24.645 --> 22:26.660
you get turfed out.
Follow me.

22:28.226 --> 22:30.762
Christine,
you have a visitor.

22:30.977 --> 22:33.132
We met yesterday
at your house.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.183
I'm melinda gordon.

22:37.428 --> 22:39.590
I should get back
to my desk.

22:43.456 --> 22:47.202
I know that the police were here
and you wouldn't talk to them.

22:47.588 --> 22:51.422
I'm not the police,
and I need you to talk to me.

22:52.016 --> 22:53.800
I knew dennis.

22:54.015 --> 22:58.430
I think I know how he died,
but it would help to know why.

23:01.397 --> 23:03.653
Christine,
can you hear me?

23:03.655 --> 23:05.643
It's gonna take some time
before christine's

23:05.645 --> 23:08.483
communicatmmn skills
are back to where they were.

23:08.486 --> 23:12.012
Ms. Gordon,
dr. Hillary sloan.

23:12.025 --> 23:15.183
I thought that she didn't suffer
any physical damage.

23:15.188 --> 23:16.302
She didn'T.

23:16.506 --> 23:20.222
But this kind of change is a lot
for a person with autism to process.

23:22.186 --> 23:25.310
Wait. Did you just
say that christine is autistic?

23:27.488 --> 23:29.462
Do you have a minute?

23:46.196 --> 23:50.690
As you can see,
they like puzzles and games.

23:51.147 --> 23:55.343
Pacing, hand flapping,
rocking back and forth-

23:55.347 --> 23:59.260
they are all coping mechanisms
for people with autism.

23:59.265 --> 24:01.370
You know, there are
high-functioning

24:01.378 --> 24:05.730
people with autism who've learned to
behave in a more socially acceptable way.

24:05.736 --> 24:07.733
A lot of them are loners.

24:07.737 --> 24:10.761
They relate better to objects
than they do to people.

24:10.767 --> 24:12.693
They don't like to talk.

24:12.695 --> 24:14.833
Or look you in the eye.

24:15.187 --> 24:18.371
They don't follow
a lot of our social rules.

24:18.378 --> 24:20.210
Dennis is autistic.

24:20.216 --> 24:23.462
Christine and dennis had lived
together since their twenties.

24:23.466 --> 24:24.592
They were a couple.

24:24.597 --> 24:27.881
Yes. They had a home-care worker
who came over once a week.

24:27.888 --> 24:31.302
Other than that,
dennis took care of her.

24:41.337 --> 24:46.352
- Where did she get this?
- Oh. Um, that's mine.

24:47.098 --> 24:50.400
I sell those in my store. She must
have taken it from my purse.

24:50.768 --> 24:52.541
It's beautiful.

27:12.998 --> 27:15.193
- It was the oven.
- I'm sorry?

27:16.677 --> 27:19.100
I know how dennis died.

27:26.545 --> 27:28.782
Wait, if it was
carbon monoxide poisoning,

27:28.787 --> 27:30.403
how come christine
wasn't affected?

27:30.408 --> 27:33.102
Because it's her ritual every time she
comes home to open up all the windows.

27:33.105 --> 27:36.481
- I saw it in a vision.
- She's not a murderer.

27:36.486 --> 27:38.550
- Murderess.
- Touche.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.170
Question is why is
Dennis still here?

27:42.176 --> 27:44.453
I found christine.
She's safe. What more is there?

27:44.455 --> 27:46.771
What I wanna know is
why is dennis still autistic.

27:46.778 --> 27:48.410
If he's dead,
he should be cured, right?

27:48.417 --> 27:50.470
Mmm, technically, yes.
Every soul is perfect.

27:50.475 --> 27:53.251
When they cross over, the handicaps
they had in life no longer affect them,

27:53.257 --> 27:56.071
but if they're earthbound,
sometimes they cling to the familiar.

27:56.076 --> 27:57.363
They can't let go
of who they were.

27:57.378 --> 27:59.482
He did answer your questions
at some point, didn't he?

27:59.485 --> 28:01.372
He's been mimicking me.
It's called echolalia.

28:01.378 --> 28:03.330
It's when they echo whatever
you say so you know

28:03.348 --> 28:05.643
that they can hear you,
even if they can't respond.

28:05.648 --> 28:08.640
Ok, so all this time, he has
been communicating with you,

28:08.647 --> 28:10.562
- ... just in his own way.
- Yes, through the ornaments.

28:10.567 --> 28:12.443
The last one that I touched
showed me how he died.

28:12.446 --> 28:15.521
Let's hope the answer to why
he's still here is in one of those.

28:18.345 --> 28:22.163
These objects, they don't vibrate any
more or less than your average object.

28:22.166 --> 28:25.573
And you can't see or hear anything
coming from inside them?

28:25.576 --> 28:27.012
Like what?
What, a movie?

28:27.015 --> 28:30.420
What am I gonna see, a movie? Listen to,
show tunes? It's wood. It's like my head.

28:30.427 --> 28:31.940
Lady, it's normal.

28:31.946 --> 28:34.260
There's nothing normal
about them.

28:34.266 --> 28:40.573
So your "friend" said she felt transported
after she held these ornaments?

28:40.695 --> 28:43.331
- Yes.
- Ok. Well, I held these ornaments.

28:43.338 --> 28:44.790
I'm still here.

28:45.525 --> 28:49.150
What time of day did your friend
say she had these visions?

28:49.156 --> 28:51.050
Why is the time of day
important?

28:51.057 --> 28:53.100
Well, yeah. If she did it
right after happy hour,

28:53.107 --> 28:55.413
- I'd say it's very important.
- Yeah, that's real funny.

28:55.448 --> 28:57.951
I thought you would at least
have a professional curiosity about this.

28:57.957 --> 28:59.070
Oh, I'm curious.

28:59.076 --> 29:02.533
I have a lot of curiosity about you,
about what you're doing here.

29:02.538 --> 29:05.463
I just wanna know if you can
see anything in these ornaments.

29:05.466 --> 29:07.233
Melinda, you haven't touched
any of these ornaments

29:07.236 --> 29:09.150
since you've been here,
not directly, not one.

29:09.156 --> 29:12.142
I wanna know what happens when
you touch these ornaments.

29:12.355 --> 29:15.441
- I don't know.
- Yeah, well, I'd like to find out.

29:15.447 --> 29:20.251
This one, the bunny, had a higher
energy rating than the other ornaments.

29:20.256 --> 29:22.490
What happens when you
touch that guy?

29:30.348 --> 29:31.840
You know, I thought you
were a man of science,

29:31.848 --> 29:33.801
and there's nothing
scientific about this.

29:33.816 --> 29:37.072
What's more scientific than
collecting my own empirical data?

29:59.808 --> 30:04.203
No! Stop it!
Mami... Don't leave me!

30:05.836 --> 30:07.332
What? What happened?

30:08.088 --> 30:09.733
What did you see?

30:10.277 --> 30:13.612
I saw a child being taken
from her mother.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.911
Are you telling me
the truth?

30:15.918 --> 30:18.360
All I can say, professor,
if I could walk out of here

30:18.367 --> 30:20.623
knowing that everything
we've talked about was made up,

30:20.627 --> 30:24.371
- I would be the happiest girl on earth.
- Wait. Psychometry.

30:24.686 --> 30:28.071
What you're talking about
is called psychometry.

30:28.078 --> 30:31.781
It's when you get visions or flashes of
the past from touching these objects.

30:33.308 --> 30:36.013
- That makes sense.
- Easy for you to say.

30:37.145 --> 30:39.463
Maybe if you did some more
tests on the ornaments.

30:39.465 --> 30:41.632
I'd like to actually
do some tests on you, melinda.

30:41.636 --> 30:42.621
Thanks for your time.

30:42.627 --> 30:44.402
Melinda, I'm not talking
about root canal here.

30:44.406 --> 30:47.370
I'm talking about
very scientific, controlled tests.

30:47.376 --> 30:49.072
They could-
they can help us.

30:49.075 --> 30:52.771
- I'm not an experiment.
- Melinda, listen.

30:55.795 --> 30:58.343
When you get a chance,
just come by.

30:58.356 --> 31:00.312
Come by and talk to me
some more.

31:00.317 --> 31:02.190
This is important.

31:12.655 --> 31:15.123
I don't think it's about him.
I think it's about both of them.

31:15.127 --> 31:16.940
Oh, that's on sale,
by the way.

31:16.945 --> 31:18.792
It's like it's his memories
of their life together,

31:18.795 --> 31:20.441
you know, how he died,
when he first saw her.

31:20.456 --> 31:21.771
- That makes sense.
- Well, whatever dennis wants,

31:21.778 --> 31:23.501
it has something to do
with christine somehow.

31:23.507 --> 31:24.882
It's too bad
she won't talk to you.

31:24.887 --> 31:26.543
Maybe she'll respond
to the ornaments.

31:26.887 --> 31:30.292
I thought that I would take them down to
the hospital and see if it could spark anything

31:30.297 --> 31:32.841
Besides, if I leave now,
I can still make visiting hours.

31:32.847 --> 31:35.430
Well, I'd offer to
mind the store, but...

31:35.436 --> 31:38.851
it's ok. I know that you're busy
saving lives while I'm saving the dead.

31:40.187 --> 31:41.810
- Bye.
- See ya.

32:01.057 --> 32:03.852
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:04.295 --> 32:06.482
How'd, uh,
ned do today?

32:06.486 --> 32:08.903
- Oh, I sent him home early.
- Really?

32:08.905 --> 32:10.730
- What did he do now?
- Oh, no. Nothing.

32:10.737 --> 32:13.122
It's fine.
It's just I had to close up.

32:13.125 --> 32:14.153
I have an errand to run.

32:14.728 --> 32:17.141
Well, don't let me
keep you.

32:17.157 --> 32:19.440
You just let me know
if he causes you any trouble, ok?

32:19.446 --> 32:21.443
You know, what I hate
is when people ask if you're ok

32:21.457 --> 32:23.750
when you're so obviously not.

32:27.187 --> 32:29.890
Yeah. I hate that, too.

32:30.396 --> 32:33.260
So, are you ok?

32:34.655 --> 32:37.340
I-
no. It's just...

32:37.956 --> 32:40.561
I don't know.
It's just been one of those days.

32:40.678 --> 32:43.302
I am so sick
of selling houses.

32:43.926 --> 32:45.313
Every time
I turn around,

32:45.318 --> 32:48.590
there's this new couple buying
their house for the first time.

32:48.656 --> 32:52.222
They're arguing about where
to put the office or the guest room.

32:53.027 --> 32:56.052
And if it's not newlyweds,
then it's new parents, and...

32:57.486 --> 32:59.961
they're trying to figure out
where the baby room goes.

32:59.968 --> 33:02.972
Everybody has
their whole life ahead of them.

33:03.908 --> 33:06.300
How long were you
and charlie married?

33:08.576 --> 33:11.211
Sometimes it feels like
we're still married.

33:12.577 --> 33:14.680
He's been dead
for 3 years now.

33:15.828 --> 33:19.281
I've just been having
such a hard time moving on.

33:19.288 --> 33:21.312
And ned's
been acting out.

33:21.818 --> 33:26.901
I know he needs me, and I am doing
everything I can to be there for him.

33:28.137 --> 33:29.872
I understand.

33:32.047 --> 33:33.720
Anyway-heh.

33:34.447 --> 33:37.151
Why don't you tell me
your secret?

33:37.155 --> 33:40.262
Oh, well, having work that you love
takes your mind off things.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.301
Ah. Well, my work
does just the opposite.

33:43.306 --> 33:45.642
Well, maybe you should
try something new.

33:45.645 --> 33:48.703
Like what? Brain surgeon?
Fighter pilot?

33:48.705 --> 33:52.350
Heh. I was thinking of something
even more challenging, like...

33:53.177 --> 33:55.580
why don't you come
and work with me?

33:56.316 --> 33:59.620
- What?
- I need the help really bad,

33:59.637 --> 34:01.403
and I can't pay
as much as one of your

34:01.416 --> 34:03.172
sales commissions,
but it's a steady check

34:03.177 --> 34:06.302
every week, and I think
you'd really like it.

34:06.866 --> 34:09.141
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

34:12.338 --> 34:15.492
- What?
- I just can't figure you out.

34:15.496 --> 34:17.203
You're like
some kind of...

34:17.208 --> 34:19.491
guardian angel
or something.

34:22.146 --> 34:25.172
Promise me that you'll
at least think about it.

34:34.016 --> 34:35.502
Bunny.

34:37.135 --> 34:38.639
Tree.

34:41.536 --> 34:43.333
Butterfly.

34:45.728 --> 34:47.101
Cake.

34:48.206 --> 34:49.771
House.

34:50.475 --> 34:50.570
Bike.

34:53.617 --> 34:55.612
Rocking chair.

34:57.135 --> 34:59.190
What do these mean
to you, christine?

35:00.025 --> 35:02.322
Bunny took me to school.

35:03.177 --> 35:06.251
She wore a butterfly
around her neck.

35:06.257 --> 35:09.632
She taught me
how to ride a bike.

35:10.347 --> 35:12.860
We sat under the tree
in front of the house.

35:13.828 --> 35:15.430
Who is bunny?

35:16.198 --> 35:19.360
Who wore a butterfly necklace
and took you to school?

35:19.365 --> 35:22.513
- She did.
- who is she?

35:23.397 --> 35:26.872
Mommy.
Mommy is she.

35:30.346 --> 35:31.870
It's her mother.

35:31.875 --> 35:35.080
These ornaments
symbolize mommy to christine.

35:35.095 --> 35:37.472
Is that what you
wanted me to do...

35:38.115 --> 35:40.302
find christine's mother?

35:40.307 --> 35:42.993
F- find christine's mother.

35:43.925 --> 35:45.562
I did.

35:59.258 --> 36:03.221
Oh, no. No, no, no. They're faceup.
That's- that's the wrong way.

36:09.158 --> 36:12.091
- This is a puzzle?
- This is a puzzle.

36:20.327 --> 36:22.113
Bunny.

36:24.478 --> 36:26.730
That's her mother?

36:30.828 --> 36:33.963
I believe these
were meant for you.

36:43.458 --> 36:45.842
Why did you
give christine away?

36:46.217 --> 36:50.552
You have to understand that
back when christine was born,

36:50.555 --> 36:53.271
people didn't know
that much about autism.

36:54.247 --> 36:59.423
Can you imagine having a child
that won't look at you or smile,

37:00.216 --> 37:05.853
a child that starts to cry
every time you try to touch her?

37:06.347 --> 37:11.351
I took christine to a doctor,
and he told me it was my fault.

37:12.005 --> 37:17.212
He said the reason she was autistic
was because I was a bad mother.

37:17.215 --> 37:19.090
That's terrible.

37:19.097 --> 37:20.812
Well, I wasn't the only one.

37:20.817 --> 37:25.011
Said we were refrigerator
mothers because we were

37:25.016 --> 37:28.542
so cold and frigid
that our children had no one

37:28.546 --> 37:32.662
to turn to for comfort,
so they turned inside themselves.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.821
So you let them
take her.

37:36.826 --> 37:40.771
I tried to see her,
to visit, but they said I couldn't,

37:42.546 --> 37:46.343
said if she was ever gonna get
any better, I had to stay away.

37:47.195 --> 37:50.030
Didn't you see her
when she was a grown-up?

37:52.498 --> 37:54.120
Once.

37:57.547 --> 38:01.003
She was living
with a young man.

38:02.038 --> 38:04.492
He was autistic, too.

38:05.497 --> 38:07.303
But it ended up in a fight...

38:07.317 --> 38:08.812
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

38:10.218 --> 38:12.261
I saw that fight.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.922
- Wh-what?
- It's not important.

38:16.318 --> 38:20.601
What is important is that you
have to try again with christine.

38:21.917 --> 38:23.980
She needs you.

38:44.638 --> 38:48.700
It's my baby girl,
all grown up.

38:49.635 --> 38:52.162
She's still in her
own little world.

38:52.167 --> 38:55.702
Christine, your mother's
here to see you.

39:02.408 --> 39:04.952
C- christine,
it's-it's mommy.

39:09.527 --> 39:13.332
- I am so sorry.
- I am so sorry.

39:16.625 --> 39:21.603
It's ok. She hears you.
Just tell her how you feel.

39:22.388 --> 39:25.992
She's not holding a grudge,
and I promise that she

39:25.996 --> 39:27.870
is not angry with you.

39:27.876 --> 39:32.160
Doesn't make one bit of difference
to her whether I'm here or not.

39:34.215 --> 39:36.431
That-
that is not true.

39:37.166 --> 39:41.181
S- say, "love is patient. "
Say, "love is patient. "

39:41.185 --> 39:43.301
You just have to
be patient.

39:54.616 --> 39:56.911
Sweetheart...

40:20.175 --> 40:22.583
liz, liz, wait.

40:25.165 --> 40:28.350
- This was a mistake.
- She needs you now more than ever.

40:28.356 --> 40:31.531
My child doesn't need me.
She never has.

40:31.536 --> 40:33.463
Everyone
needs their mother.

40:33.468 --> 40:37.151
But she will never
be able to love me, melinda.

40:37.156 --> 40:39.560
She doesn't even know
what love is.

40:39.568 --> 40:43.083
That's not true. Christine loves.
She just doesn't know how to show it.

40:43.118 --> 40:45.013
Her boyfriend,
he was teaching her how.

40:45.016 --> 40:48.801
You can't teach somebody how to love.
They either feel it, or they don'T.

40:48.807 --> 40:52.231
- Ask her.
- Do you love christine?

40:52.905 --> 40:54.771
I want to, but...

40:56.067 --> 40:58.991
I don't know how
if she can't love me back.

40:59.475 --> 41:01.252
Well, then you have to
show her love first,

41:01.258 --> 41:03.813
even if it means
she doesn't know how to love you.

41:04.498 --> 41:08.490
I think all dennis wants is just for
you to be in christine's life again.

41:15.435 --> 41:18.413
That's what I want, too.

41:24.645 --> 41:26.550
Thank you.

41:30.117 --> 41:33.041
I hope this is what you wanted.
This is what you wanted, right?

41:33.046 --> 41:35.680
- Right.
- Are you ready to go?

41:35.685 --> 41:39.162
- Where?
- Into the light. Can't you still see it?

41:41.425 --> 41:45.450
- Mm-hmm. I see the sun.
- No, not the sun. The light.

41:45.455 --> 41:47.350
The sun is the light.

41:47.478 --> 41:50.091
I thought you could
see the light.

41:50.425 --> 41:53.263
Is there something else
than I can help you with?

41:54.178 --> 41:59.080
You know what love is.
What is love?

42:01.257 --> 42:03.411
What does it feel like?

42:07.116 --> 42:11.352
Dennis, what you did to bring
liz and christine together,

42:12.398 --> 42:14.910
that's what love is.

42:15.448 --> 42:19.003
It's not about what we say.
It's about what we do.
