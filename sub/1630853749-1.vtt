WEBVTT

01:33.226 --> 01:34.494
<i>L'Afrique.</i>

02:12.265 --> 02:13.501
To Tangier.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.637
<i>-Tangier!</i>
<i>-Tangier!</i>

02:17.905 --> 02:19.641
How can it take this long
to sort out a car,

02:19.674 --> 02:20.875
for fuck's sake?

02:20.908 --> 02:23.678
It's Morocco, not Milton Keynes.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.546
-Hey!
-What's the matter?

02:27.715 --> 02:31.251
-Glad we aren't staying here.
-Mm.

02:31.284 --> 02:34.421
We'll stay on the way back.
Might be interesting.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.758
Interesting in a good way
or interesting in a bad way?

02:39.694 --> 02:41.763
It's 400 miles to Azna.

02:41.796 --> 02:42.797
Long way to go for a party,

02:42.830 --> 02:45.465
but then they're more
your friends than mine.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.701
That'll be news to Richard.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.487
Look at them.
Continental wildebeest.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.990
You'd think
they hadn't eaten in days.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.491
Maybe they don't give them
any sandwiches

04:17.524 --> 04:18.892
on those buses.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.265
Should you still be drinking?

04:26.634 --> 04:28.536
It's just a glass.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.303
You'll finish the bottle
like you always do.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.039
Why am I thinking harpy?

04:32.073 --> 04:34.008
Why am I thinking shrill?

04:34.041 --> 04:37.344
Why am I thinking
highly functioning alcoholic?

04:37.377 --> 04:38.880
I've always thought
the highly functioning part

04:38.913 --> 04:41.783
should cancel out
the alcoholic part.

04:41.816 --> 04:43.684
You know,
like a double negative.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.687
Besides, the roads are empty.

05:36.904 --> 05:39.874
It's not a military timetable.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.441
Do you want to stay here
a night?

05:43.077 --> 05:44.679
I want to get to Richard's.

05:48.049 --> 05:49.382
It's all right.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.686
They treat their women
like donkeys.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.754
To them, you're just
an escaped donkey.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.455
You know I hate it
when you say things like that.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.457
-Well, it's true, isn't it?
-It doesn't matter if it is.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.492
I'd say it matters.
I'd say it matters very much.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.928
You have no idea
how they treat their women.

06:00.962 --> 06:02.395
None.

06:02.864 --> 06:05.766
-Ah, Monsieur?
-Oui?

06:13.074 --> 06:14.075
Merci.

06:16.811 --> 06:17.912
Damn internet.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.848
- Face it, David, we're lost.
- We're not lost.

06:20.882 --> 06:23.483
We just have to find
the turn-off to Azna.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.687
-Is this the right road?
-There's only one road.

06:26.721 --> 06:29.422
We just passed through Midelt.
We should turn towards Tafnet.

06:29.456 --> 06:30.291
I didn't see any other road
that might fit--

06:30.324 --> 06:32.860
I didn't say anything
about Tafnet.

06:32.894 --> 06:33.327
Doesn't matter,
this is the right--

06:33.361 --> 06:34.729
We left too late.

06:34.762 --> 06:35.395
Yes, of course,
it's my fault.

06:35.428 --> 06:36.230
Because you insisted on us--

06:36.264 --> 06:37.632
Change the bloody record,
would you?

06:37.665 --> 06:38.498
I'm going to call Richard.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.034
No, we're not calling
bloody anyone.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.472
Must be one of the guests.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.575
-But what if they're not?
-They're white, aren't they?

07:22.977 --> 07:25.513
Strange, they didn't stop.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.082
What if we'd had a crash?
They didn't even slow down.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.186
-That's the turn.
-No, it's not.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.587
-This is the turn.
-No, David.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.856
Don't be so bloody stupid.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.804
Welcome.

08:13.060 --> 08:13.995
Cocktail, sir.

08:14.028 --> 08:16.897
- Shukran. Merci.
- Fuck it, whatever.

08:16.931 --> 08:19.300
All on your Pat Malone?

08:19.333 --> 08:22.003
My wife ran off
with the hedge fund manager.

08:22.036 --> 08:23.971
Oh, I did that once.

08:24.005 --> 08:25.940
How'd it work out?

08:25.973 --> 08:28.175
He let me keep the condo
in Cabo.

08:31.045 --> 08:34.582
You like the music?
It's very unique.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.784
No, it's not.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.184
They used to play it
on every floor

08:38.219 --> 08:40.154
of every Virgin Megastore.

08:41.856 --> 08:44.058
Oh, you're one of those people.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.227
Oh, maybe.

08:47.228 --> 08:49.196
Okay, bye-bye.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.338
Uh, thank you.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.640
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you. Shut up.

09:01.042 --> 09:03.978
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.780
Thank you all for attending

09:05.813 --> 09:08.315
our little soirée out here
in the desert.

09:08.349 --> 09:11.786
This magnificent edifice
in which you'll be staying

09:11.819 --> 09:13.788
is what's known as a Ksour.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.290
-That's Arab for castle.
-Thank you, Dally.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.193
The renovation proceeds at pace.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.729
Dally and I never thought
it would turn out so well.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.931
The renovation's
a complete farce.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.167
And we couldn't have done it
without the wonderful help

09:26.200 --> 09:28.702
of our little Moroccan friends.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.205
Baksheesh.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.975
So, look, we hope
you'll find this place

09:35.009 --> 09:36.343
a vision of paradise.

09:36.377 --> 09:40.381
A place in which to receive
the people we love.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.750
But enough waffling.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.018
Dinner will be served
promptly,

09:44.051 --> 09:45.252
at 11:00, at which point

09:45.286 --> 09:47.855
I encourage you
to try the pastry

09:47.888 --> 09:50.124
stuffed with sardines
created by our chef,

09:50.157 --> 09:52.093
monsieur Ben. Sensational.

09:52.126 --> 09:53.861
In the meantime,
please sample the honey.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.930
It's the best in the world,
and locally sourced.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.231
And don't forget the figs,

09:57.264 --> 09:59.767
traditionally representative
of a woman's vagina.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.836
Or so we've been told.

10:04.939 --> 10:07.241
<i>-Sláinte.</i>
<i>-Sláinte.</i>

10:11.912 --> 10:15.049
-Dicky.
-Hey, Tom.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.251
I didn't see you there.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.186
Did one of the boys
get you a drink?

10:19.220 --> 10:20.855
Can't be in a library
without a drink.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.056
Haven't seen anyone.

10:23.157 --> 10:25.226
Maybe they're sorting
out the quail.

10:25.259 --> 10:28.362
Speaking of quail,
did you bring a hotsy-totsy?

10:28.395 --> 10:30.297
Girls won't touch me these days.

10:30.331 --> 10:31.765
What about boys?

10:33.834 --> 10:36.070
Dally tells me
you have 1,000 girlfriends.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.272
I've got three
and they all hate me.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.741
You should get down to the pool.
Have you seen those Russians?

10:40.774 --> 10:41.775
Oh là l.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.878
David. It's Richard.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.981
Where the bloody hell
have you and Jo got to? Call me.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.717
-Who's that?
-Old friend.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.785
He's an alcoholic.
I shouldn't have let him drive.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.089
Do people get lost driving here?

10:55.122 --> 10:57.391
All the time.
We say it's part of the charm.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.294
You have an impressive house.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.763
I have an eye for Islamic art,
my time at Christie's.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.232
Why don't you live here
all year round?

11:06.300 --> 11:09.703
One has to get a little older
before moving to the desert.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.139
Dally's not ready yet. I am.

11:45.540 --> 11:46.373
I take it
you're not a friend of--

11:46.407 --> 11:49.243
I'm here on assignment
to do a profile.

11:49.276 --> 11:52.213
But I'm really only here
because of Leila Tarki.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.082
I have no idea who that is.

11:55.115 --> 11:59.119
You don't know Leila Tarki?
The Moroccan auteur?

11:59.153 --> 12:00.287
She's the coolest.

12:00.321 --> 12:02.189
She's only here
to raise financing

12:02.223 --> 12:04.792
-for a new movie.
-Oh, movie, huh?

12:04.825 --> 12:07.228
-What's it about?
-Nomads.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.397
Nomads. Right.

12:10.431 --> 12:12.199
At least
it's not about refugees.

12:12.233 --> 12:13.801
One thing to be thankful for.

12:13.834 --> 12:17.304
-Nomads are going to save us.
-Are they?

12:17.338 --> 12:20.174
They have the right
environmental ideas.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.376
Leila says I look like a nomad.

12:49.403 --> 12:51.105
We were driving along there...

12:51.138 --> 12:53.107
and we saw a couple
by the side of the road.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.342
Oh, we thought
they'd just had sex.

12:55.376 --> 12:57.579
This is the Henningers,
the English couple?

12:57.612 --> 12:59.847
Yes, I suppose.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.416
Could have been bandits
dressed as English people.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.984
Or English bandits.

13:04.018 --> 13:09.123
Plenty of those around
of the "ass" variety.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.526
Are you gay as well?

13:11.559 --> 13:14.228
No, I'm not.
But I fucked a man who is.

13:16.030 --> 13:17.131
Were they having an argument?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.600
I don't know.

13:18.633 --> 13:20.200
They're not here though,
are they?

13:25.372 --> 13:27.575
Thank you, Dally.
Friends.

13:27.609 --> 13:30.512
Life is but a sport
or a pastime,

13:30.545 --> 13:33.447
as the Qur'an tells us.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.983
And, because it is
a game and nothing more,

13:36.016 --> 13:39.286
we forget that the point
of life is death.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.456
So, eat, drink, be merry,
for tomorrow we die.

13:43.457 --> 13:45.392
A little hackneyed, my love.

13:54.602 --> 13:56.136
What do you think
of the outfits?

13:56.170 --> 13:58.105
I designed them myself.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.508
Completely authentic.

14:00.542 --> 14:03.010
-Are they?
-Yeah they are.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.546
They may as well be statues.

14:04.579 --> 14:05.547
What's that supposed to mean?

14:05.580 --> 14:09.883
-What kind of name is Dally?
-It's a nickname.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.453
An insult or an endearment?

14:12.486 --> 14:14.221
Take your fucking pick.

14:31.171 --> 14:32.206
What.

14:35.643 --> 14:36.477
Dicky.

14:59.133 --> 15:00.502
Good God.

15:00.535 --> 15:03.036
Hit him on the road.
It's very unclear.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.507
Unclear?
Why would it be unclear?

15:05.540 --> 15:07.408
They say he was selling fossils
by the side of the road.

15:07.441 --> 15:09.511
He stepped out
and they hit him by accident.

15:11.345 --> 15:12.946
But there has never been
a fossil seller on that road

15:12.980 --> 15:14.616
at night.

15:14.649 --> 15:17.017
Or during the day.
That's why it's unclear.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.153
Anyone recognize him?

15:19.186 --> 15:22.022
No, he's not from here.
He's from the South.

15:25.527 --> 15:27.494
- What about the tattoo?
- A diamond.

15:29.430 --> 15:30.964
Ouarida.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.066
It is for protection
against the evil eye.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.170
Didn't bloody work then, did it?

15:36.203 --> 15:38.272
Lay him out somewhere.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.275
-The garage?
-Yes, the garage. Good idea.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.376
We don't want the guests
getting wind

15:42.409 --> 15:43.444
there's a body on the premises.

15:43.477 --> 15:44.546
Last thing we need.

15:45.747 --> 15:47.715
Shall we clean out the car?

15:47.749 --> 15:50.951
No, we have to call
the police in Taza.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.329
Smashed headlights,
smashed bumper.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.666
Must have been going
at a fair clip.

16:04.699 --> 16:06.266
An accident, they said.

16:08.670 --> 16:10.471
Do you believe them?

16:10.505 --> 16:12.406
They are your guests.
How am I not to believe them?

16:12.439 --> 16:14.542
But do you in fact believe them?

16:14.576 --> 16:17.478
I think they're scared.
And I'm thinking of a proverb.

16:19.747 --> 16:22.750
Go ahead.
I like a good proverb.

16:22.784 --> 16:25.152
Open your door to a good day

16:25.185 --> 16:27.387
and prepare yourself
for a bad one.

16:58.686 --> 17:01.021
-David.
-Richard.

17:02.857 --> 17:04.290
How are you feeling?

17:05.792 --> 17:06.961
Bloody hot.

17:06.994 --> 17:10.196
-It's the Sahara, old boy.
-I know it's the fucking Sahara.

17:13.734 --> 17:15.167
Uh.

17:16.804 --> 17:18.238
You're dressed for dinner.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.241
So, the world's still normal.

17:22.544 --> 17:25.579
You should get changed.
Both of you. Get changed.

17:25.613 --> 17:28.115
Have a shower,
turn up for dinner.

17:28.147 --> 17:30.618
Police will be here in an hour.

17:30.652 --> 17:32.687
I know the officer in charge.
It will be a formality.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.388
Oh, a formality, okay.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.523
How did it happen?

17:36.758 --> 17:38.125
You should tell me
before we tell the police.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.093
Get everything ironed out.

17:40.127 --> 17:43.330
We were bowling along
looking for the sign for Azna.

17:45.499 --> 17:48.603
And there was a lot of sand
blowing across the road.

17:48.636 --> 17:50.070
I couldn't see.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.477
And he just stepped out
in front of us

17:57.512 --> 18:00.180
like he didn't understand
the speed of a car.

18:00.213 --> 18:04.117
The fact is we hit him.
We hit him and we killed him.

18:04.151 --> 18:07.454
Well, the main thing
is to come clean,

18:07.487 --> 18:09.389
cooperate with the police

18:09.423 --> 18:12.092
and seem
overwhelmingly contrite.

18:13.561 --> 18:15.897
-We can do that, can't we?
-Mmm.

18:15.930 --> 18:18.165
If it's absolutely necessary.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.367
David.

18:22.235 --> 18:26.139
Poor fucking kid.
When are the cops getting here?

18:26.173 --> 18:28.208
They arrive when they arrive.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.812
They arrive when they arrive.
What kind of fucking--?

18:30.845 --> 18:33.681
Hey, this is a fucking disaster.

18:33.715 --> 18:35.550
-Have you checked his pockets?
-Yeah, nothing in him.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.518
No ID, not a single dirham,
no nothing.

18:37.552 --> 18:38.753
It's highly unusual
for a Moroccan

18:38.786 --> 18:41.188
-not to be carrying ID.
-You're telling me.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.724
Hey, where are those
fuckers anyway?

18:42.757 --> 18:44.659
Dinner. Putting a brave face
on things.

18:44.692 --> 18:47.629
-Was he drunk?
-I don't know.

18:48.696 --> 18:49.897
They ran right over him.

18:49.931 --> 18:52.366
The kid wasn't just hit.
Am I right?

18:52.399 --> 18:53.400
Am I right?!

18:54.736 --> 18:58.205
What are we going to do?
I mean, you called the cops.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.808
Now, it's going to be
a fucking circus.

19:00.842 --> 19:03.176
What would you suggest we do?

19:03.210 --> 19:04.746
Get it settled tonight.
Pay him off.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.616
They'd have to find out
who he is.

19:08.650 --> 19:11.318
If they find that out,
things might change.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.756
Jesus.
Are you kidding?

19:14.789 --> 19:16.423
I don't think we have anything
to worry about.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.760
-It's clear what happened.
-Oh, it is, is it?

19:18.793 --> 19:20.227
Cause I don't think
it's clear at all.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.796
I think that limey
is hiding something.

19:21.829 --> 19:24.732
Any chance to fuck with us
and they will.

19:24.766 --> 19:26.634
-Who?
-The Moroccans!

19:26.668 --> 19:29.771
The family will show up
and they will fuck with us!

19:29.804 --> 19:32.239
They'll say the infidels
killed their boy.

19:33.508 --> 19:35.208
Which would be true.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.512
We were saying
you must have had an accident.

19:37.545 --> 19:38.546
A flat tire.

19:38.579 --> 19:41.549
People always get flat tires
out in the desert.

19:42.784 --> 19:45.318
We all felt sorry for you.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.387
A flat tire in the dark.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.290
What a drag. Was it?

19:50.323 --> 19:52.860
-Can't you see they want to eat?
-No, it's all right.

19:52.894 --> 19:54.529
We just need some time
to recover.

19:55.663 --> 19:59.967
People disappear here.
They just vanish.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.404
Did the Arabs molest you?

20:04.438 --> 20:06.273
I'm sorry,
I didn't get your...

20:07.575 --> 20:08.676
<i>Enchanté.</i>

20:10.377 --> 20:11.612
She's a nomad.

20:13.581 --> 20:15.950
Did you pass Beni Mellal?

20:15.983 --> 20:18.953
We came through Midelt.
It's a different road.

20:18.986 --> 20:20.387
Did you get lost?

20:20.420 --> 20:21.522
We didn't get lost.

20:21.556 --> 20:23.825
It was just a long
slog of a drive.

20:23.858 --> 20:24.926
It's the road
most of us came on.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.728
Yes, but we didn't know it.

20:26.761 --> 20:28.462
We didn't know
which turning it was.

20:28.495 --> 20:32.633
So, it wasn't a flat tire.
You were just lost.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.468
Not exactly.

20:34.502 --> 20:36.804
We hit a Moroccan on the road
and we killed him.

20:50.785 --> 20:54.287
It was an accident.
He stepped out in front of us.

21:01.562 --> 21:02.764
I think you're wanted.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.568
I can't understand
why you did that.

21:07.602 --> 21:09.504
Was it to humiliate me?

21:09.537 --> 21:11.672
You can't keep pretending
forever. Why lie to them?

21:11.706 --> 21:12.907
But it wasn't our fault, was it?

21:12.940 --> 21:14.341
I mean,
you don't seriously expect me

21:14.374 --> 21:15.176
to take the fault for this

21:15.209 --> 21:16.844
just because
some fucking carjacker

21:16.878 --> 21:17.879
-decided to shoot the two of--
-Carjacker.

21:17.912 --> 21:19.814
Carjacker, yes.

21:19.847 --> 21:22.349
You haven't been
following the news. I have.

21:23.885 --> 21:26.053
You have a practice in Chelsea,
monsieur Henninger.

21:26.087 --> 21:29.489
Uhm, yes, that's... Yes.

21:29.524 --> 21:30.591
And you, madam?

21:31.726 --> 21:34.061
You write children's books,
I believe?

21:34.095 --> 21:37.598
Not very successful ones,
I'm afraid, Captain.

21:37.632 --> 21:39.534
I'm sure
you're just being modest.

21:39.567 --> 21:41.669
May I have a title
I could look up for my children?

21:42.603 --> 21:45.907
The last one was called
<i>Balthazar's Nighttime.</i>

21:45.940 --> 21:47.407
It's a little pretentious.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.811
Ah, but it is charming.

21:49.844 --> 21:51.946
Do you not find,
monsieur Galloway?

21:51.979 --> 21:53.313
Charming.

21:55.116 --> 21:57.450
This man you killed.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.954
Boy, I should say.
He was a fossil seller.

21:59.987 --> 22:01.856
Yes, but I mean...

22:01.889 --> 22:03.356
It was clear
he wasn't interested

22:03.390 --> 22:05.059
in selling us fossils.

22:05.092 --> 22:07.862
How could he be?
This time of night.

22:07.895 --> 22:09.797
Middle of bloody nowhere.

22:09.831 --> 22:13.034
People here are desperate,
monsieur Henninger.

22:13.067 --> 22:15.703
They would do almost anything
to sell a single fossil.

22:15.736 --> 22:18.573
Forty Euros is a good sum
for them.

22:18.606 --> 22:21.642
I'm aware of that.
I know they're poor.

22:21.676 --> 22:23.476
We're really very sorry
about this, captain.

22:23.511 --> 22:23.978
I mean...

22:25.847 --> 22:27.447
We're devastated,
to be honest.

22:29.016 --> 22:30.117
Yeah, devastated.

22:33.187 --> 22:34.622
I'm sure you are.

22:37.058 --> 22:39.060
By the way, I was wondering.

22:39.093 --> 22:41.128
You are sure there was
only one boy?

22:41.162 --> 22:45.833
-They often travel in pairs.
-Uh, yes, one boy.

22:45.867 --> 22:46.868
You are sure.

22:46.901 --> 22:49.804
-Yes, we're sure.
-Good.

22:49.837 --> 22:51.471
We will record it
as an accidental death.

22:52.974 --> 22:54.876
You'll take the body
with you?

22:54.909 --> 22:56.010
No, we cannot do that.

22:56.043 --> 22:57.745
We do not have a morgue
at our post.

22:57.778 --> 22:59.814
There'll have to be arrangements
made tomorrow.

22:59.847 --> 23:01.515
hope you can enjoy the rest
of your weekend,

23:01.549 --> 23:03.117
monsieur Galloway.

23:03.150 --> 23:04.986
The fire-eaters from Taza
are arriving tomorrow.

23:05.653 --> 23:06.654
Splendid.

23:18.966 --> 23:20.968
What do we make
of the Henningers?

23:21.002 --> 23:24.171
She's all right.
Not sure about him.

23:25.472 --> 23:26.574
Typical bourgeois.

23:28.910 --> 23:31.078
-What are you doing?
-Stepping on diamonds.

23:32.079 --> 23:34.048
It's taboo.

23:34.081 --> 23:35.783
I hope the genies
get pissed off.

23:35.816 --> 23:36.884
God's sake, David.

23:36.918 --> 23:39.720
Oh, I hate all this ethnic
pretense and affectation.

23:39.754 --> 23:41.022
You can treat people decently

23:41.055 --> 23:43.057
without rolling their carpets
out everywhere.

23:43.090 --> 23:44.058
Bloody kitsch.

23:45.893 --> 23:47.494
A drink drink? Mm.

23:49.096 --> 23:51.198
Hot chocolate's good. Yum.

23:54.969 --> 23:56.971
I don't like the sound
of those dogs.

23:57.004 --> 23:58.205
They should drive them off.

23:58.239 --> 24:00.508
I think they're wild camels.
I heard one of the staff say--

24:00.541 --> 24:02.777
Staff? Servants, you mean?

24:02.810 --> 24:04.477
Oh, whatever.

24:04.512 --> 24:06.714
They should still
drive them off.

24:06.747 --> 24:07.682
Camels bite.

24:09.617 --> 24:11.519
I hear they do.

24:11.552 --> 24:13.187
They like to bite people
in the stomach.

24:13.220 --> 24:15.823
It's the leading cause
of death among the Arabs.

24:15.856 --> 24:17.858
The police will do nothing.

24:17.892 --> 24:19.827
And what do you expect them
to do?

24:19.860 --> 24:22.930
I heard one of the boys saying
his legs were pulped.

24:25.766 --> 24:27.101
The dead man.
Pulped?

24:28.169 --> 24:29.837
They didn't just hit him.

24:29.870 --> 24:32.640
They run over him.
Maybe more than once.

24:32.673 --> 24:34.508
Bullshit.

24:34.542 --> 24:36.510
What do they call it
in your country?

24:36.544 --> 24:38.846
-They have a word for it?
-Roadkill.

24:38.879 --> 24:40.648
I think we should
get some sleep.

24:40.681 --> 24:42.083
Why?

24:42.683 --> 24:44.952
I'm loosening up finally.

24:44.986 --> 24:46.187
The sun's gonna be up
in a few hours

24:46.220 --> 24:48.089
and I want to sleep it off.

24:48.122 --> 24:50.691
They won't come back.
The police.

24:54.028 --> 24:57.565
-Did Richard bribe them?
-Yeah, possibly.

24:57.598 --> 24:59.033
It's actually a huge
hassle for them.

24:59.066 --> 25:00.701
So much paperwork involved.

25:03.104 --> 25:05.206
-And, I hate to say it--
-No, you don't.

25:07.141 --> 25:09.610
I hate to say it,
but the kid is a nobody.

25:10.745 --> 25:13.714
He's from a village far away
and no one knows who he is.

25:16.851 --> 25:18.586
No ID, no witnesses.

25:22.790 --> 25:23.657
So, that's that.

25:25.659 --> 25:26.861
That's that.

25:44.712 --> 25:46.747
Where the fuck am I?

26:44.004 --> 26:44.905
Morning.

26:54.982 --> 26:57.818
-You forgot the honey.
-Madam?

26:59.854 --> 27:01.088
Nevermind.

27:01.422 --> 27:03.290
Do you have any idea
where my husband is?

27:03.324 --> 27:04.358
Horse riding.

27:08.796 --> 27:10.164
Horse riding.

27:10.197 --> 27:13.801
Have I told you how much
I admire your boots, ladies?

27:13.834 --> 27:15.936
They give one something
to grab hold of, don't they?

27:15.970 --> 27:17.738
Given half a chance.

27:17.771 --> 27:19.840
Have I told you
how loathsome I find you,

27:19.874 --> 27:22.343
-monsieur Henninger?
-You didn't mention it, no.

27:22.376 --> 27:24.845
And please call me David
if you're going to insult me.

27:24.879 --> 27:27.815
I'd slap your bottom for you,
but I know you'd just enjoy it.

27:27.848 --> 27:29.850
I certainly would.

27:29.884 --> 27:32.186
I must say I'm enjoying
this little threesome immensely.

27:44.899 --> 27:47.835
Very picturesque, I suppose,
in a banal sort of way.

27:49.870 --> 27:52.106
Why did Richard
and Dally come here?

27:52.139 --> 27:53.807
Gays have always come
to North Africa.

27:53.841 --> 27:56.143
Usually to bugger
little Arab boys.

27:56.177 --> 27:58.145
- It's an Edwardian tradition.
<i>- Mon dieu</i> .

27:58.179 --> 28:00.147
That is such
an offensive thing to say.

28:00.181 --> 28:01.715
Interesting.
You said it was offensive,

28:01.749 --> 28:02.917
not that it wasn't true.

28:04.418 --> 28:06.353
I thought Richard
was a friend of yours.

28:06.387 --> 28:09.123
He is.
I was speaking historically.

28:09.156 --> 28:11.158
Oscar Wilde, André Gide,

28:11.192 --> 28:14.128
Joe Orton, Allen Ginsberg,
William Burroughs...

28:14.161 --> 28:17.932
I mean, I could go on and on.
Pederasts. The lot of them.

28:21.402 --> 28:23.370
You're a real shit-stirrer,
aren't you, David?

28:23.404 --> 28:25.406
Well, it passes the time

28:25.439 --> 28:27.741
in an increasingly
tedious world.

28:27.775 --> 28:29.176
I was saying to Richard--

28:29.210 --> 28:31.845
Fuck! Little shit.

28:33.948 --> 28:36.283
Oh, my God.

28:54.134 --> 28:55.102
Nice hat.

28:57.037 --> 28:58.339
Got it in Casablanca.

29:00.174 --> 29:01.175
"Made in China."

29:02.243 --> 29:03.477
What were you doing
in Casablanca?

29:04.812 --> 29:06.380
I was playing ping-pong
with a hooker

29:06.413 --> 29:07.948
at the Tahiti hotel.

29:10.518 --> 29:12.520
I've heard about
that kind of ping-pong.

29:12.554 --> 29:15.022
Hookers find me irresistible.
Wanna know why?

29:15.055 --> 29:16.991
You smell of money?

29:17.525 --> 29:19.393
Did she do anal?

29:19.426 --> 29:22.062
What's the point of a hooker
if she doesn't do anal?

29:22.096 --> 29:23.764
I'm going to tell your mother
you said that.

29:24.832 --> 29:27.134
My mother would be fascinated.

29:27.167 --> 29:28.869
- Have you been here before?
- Mm-mm.

29:28.902 --> 29:32.306
We never get away.
David works all the time.

29:32.339 --> 29:34.375
His patients
are all rich old bags

29:34.408 --> 29:37.144
who harass him mercilessly
around the clock.

29:37.177 --> 29:40.047
This is a strange place
for a holiday home.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.982
It's like they're living out
some kind of fantasy,

29:42.016 --> 29:44.485
-I guess.
-I like it here.

29:44.519 --> 29:47.087
It feels like a country
where useless men can be happy.

29:47.121 --> 29:50.057
And are you a useless man?

29:50.424 --> 29:52.326
I follow the way of the Buddha.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.298
It's good to know that
there are other useless people

29:57.331 --> 29:58.232
in this world.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.901
Besides me.

30:05.372 --> 30:06.440
We should get out of the sun.

30:08.275 --> 30:11.912
-Before we start to bleed.
-I don't bleed very easily.

30:15.015 --> 30:17.951
We were riding the trail
and they were waiting for us.

30:17.985 --> 30:19.019
Could have been nasty.

30:19.053 --> 30:22.022
Could have been nasty?
It was nasty, little cunt.

30:22.056 --> 30:24.124
I've always said
they were an irrational people.

30:24.158 --> 30:25.259
Didn't like seeing me
on the horse,

30:25.292 --> 30:27.094
I expect.
Thought I was enjoying myself.

30:27.127 --> 30:29.997
-Mm-hm. Weren't you?
-That's not the point.

30:32.066 --> 30:33.367
Is it against the law
to unwind

30:33.400 --> 30:35.169
after a traumatic event?

30:36.370 --> 30:37.137
Here.

30:42.009 --> 30:44.945
Some kids from the other side
of the valley, apparently.

30:44.978 --> 30:46.146
Everyone's heard about it.

30:47.649 --> 30:48.916
Heard about what?

30:48.949 --> 30:50.618
The accident, what do you think?

30:50.652 --> 30:51.885
Give it here.

30:53.688 --> 30:55.422
They're insatiable gossips.

30:56.658 --> 30:58.959
It's a function
of being illiterate.

31:01.061 --> 31:03.130
What a nice little fascist
you've become

31:03.163 --> 31:05.466
since being hit by a stone.

31:05.499 --> 31:09.069
-Is that all it takes?
-They could have blinded me.

31:09.103 --> 31:10.337
I could have been
bloody disfigured.

31:13.508 --> 31:14.441
They're heading this way.

31:15.442 --> 31:18.445
- It's not the police.
- Haven't heard from them.

31:18.479 --> 31:19.614
Mint suppliers?

31:19.647 --> 31:21.915
They came this morning.

31:21.949 --> 31:24.318
-Maybe someone from the morgue.
-Do they even have morgues?

31:24.351 --> 31:26.320
Don't they just throw the body
in a pit or something?

31:26.353 --> 31:29.957
There's a morgue in Errachidia.
Might be a pick up from them.

31:29.990 --> 31:32.426
I wish you hasn't invited
the Henningers.

31:32.459 --> 31:34.361
What a bore they are
and what a mess they've made.

31:34.395 --> 31:36.163
-Did you see his shoes?
-Are they a bore?

31:36.196 --> 31:37.064
Oh, they're a horrible bore.

31:37.097 --> 31:37.732
I guarantee you
they're the only ones

31:37.766 --> 31:39.266
who don't dress up tonight.

31:39.299 --> 31:40.568
They'll claim
they have post traumatic

31:40.602 --> 31:42.570
-stress disorder or something.
-I'm sure it is what they have.

31:42.604 --> 31:44.539
Let's face it, babe. Pirates.

31:44.572 --> 31:46.608
A bit cheesy,
a bit fucking eighties.

31:46.641 --> 31:48.275
You always pooh-pooh my ideas.

31:48.308 --> 31:50.578
Hardly keeping
with the aesthetic though.

31:50.612 --> 31:53.347
You always pooh-pooh my ideas.
And they're not just pirates.

31:53.380 --> 31:56.383
They are buccaneers and wenches,
and sexy swashbucklers.

31:56.417 --> 31:57.451
All right.

31:57.484 --> 31:58.520
Just as long
as they don't end up

31:58.553 --> 32:00.187
plundering any of my paintings.

32:02.590 --> 32:03.991
You were right
about the Henningers.

32:04.024 --> 32:05.727
We should have invited
the Bainbridges instead.

32:05.760 --> 32:08.095
Yeah, they're generally wacko.

32:08.128 --> 32:09.697
And they don't kill people
on the way up.

33:06.386 --> 33:08.322
The father?

33:08.355 --> 33:09.990
You'll leave him
kneeling there all day?

33:10.792 --> 33:14.328
-They are Aït Kebash.
-So...

33:15.462 --> 33:17.397
They will try
to extort money from you.

33:18.065 --> 33:20.267
Where do the Aït Kebash live?

33:20.300 --> 33:22.336
Far. Far out.

33:22.369 --> 33:24.271
Then they've come a long way.
Open the gate.

33:24.304 --> 33:25.707
They will blackmail you.

33:25.740 --> 33:27.307
The men of the desert
know everything.

33:27.341 --> 33:28.810
No, they don't.
They just assume the worst,

33:28.843 --> 33:30.377
which makes them right
nine times out of ten.

34:56.630 --> 34:57.732
What.

34:58.700 --> 35:00.400
He said the Englishman must pay.

35:03.538 --> 35:04.606
Fuck that.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.475
Pay the old crow.
Make him go away.

35:08.509 --> 35:10.578
You don't pay someone for
an accident, for fuck's sake.

35:10.612 --> 35:12.245
You don't even know
how much he wants.

35:12.279 --> 35:13.313
Might just be 1,000 Euros.

35:13.347 --> 35:15.282
-Or a fuck of a lot more.
-That's nothing for us.

35:15.315 --> 35:17.484
- It's blackmail.
- So what if it is?

35:17.518 --> 35:19.621
What's the word for blackmail
in their language?

35:19.654 --> 35:21.188
If they even have one.

35:21.221 --> 35:23.256
You think villages in the Sahara
are living in shit

35:23.290 --> 35:23.958
in the same way we do?

35:23.992 --> 35:25.627
It's the principle of the thing.

35:25.660 --> 35:28.328
It's the principle of the thing
plus 1,000 Euros.

35:28.362 --> 35:29.831
That seems like
a pretty good deal

35:29.864 --> 35:31.164
for the cost of a life.

35:31.198 --> 35:32.634
Not when I'm being robbed.

35:32.667 --> 35:34.636
You're not being robbed.
You're being spared.

35:34.669 --> 35:36.771
Why? What are they going
to do to me?

35:36.804 --> 35:39.641
Lynch me?
Public castration?

35:39.674 --> 35:41.843
I wasn't thinking
about them lynching you.

35:41.876 --> 35:43.911
And I wasn't thinking about them
cutting off your cock.

35:43.945 --> 35:45.647
I was thinking about them
not going away.

35:45.680 --> 35:48.382
Of course,
your precious weekend.

35:48.415 --> 35:50.283
Must not forget
your bloody party.

35:50.317 --> 35:53.186
What about contacting
the consulate in Casablanca?

35:53.220 --> 35:54.187
I don't think
you're really considering

35:54.221 --> 35:55.757
your own best interests.

35:55.790 --> 35:57.725
If we contact the consulate,
there'd have to be

35:57.759 --> 35:58.826
a thorough look
at this whole thing.

35:58.860 --> 36:01.562
And I mean thorough.

36:01.596 --> 36:03.531
-I don't think you want that.
-I would welcome the consulate--

36:03.564 --> 36:06.466
- No, David.
- I don't think you would.

36:12.640 --> 36:13.941
-Fine, I'll go.
-No.

36:13.975 --> 36:14.909
I would like to pay
my respects anyway.

36:14.942 --> 36:17.979
No. That is absolutely
out of the question.

36:18.012 --> 36:19.814
You know how these people are.

36:19.847 --> 36:21.916
It'd make things
so much more awkward.

36:21.949 --> 36:24.418
Well, we wouldn't want
to make things awkward.

36:37.364 --> 36:40.233
I see Lord Swanthorne's arrived.

36:42.704 --> 36:45.673
-Do you know him?
-From the club.

36:45.707 --> 36:47.942
Perfect parasite,
but amusing in his way.

36:54.414 --> 36:55.516
So, how's the practice?

36:55.550 --> 36:57.685
-Not too good.
-Huh.

36:57.719 --> 37:00.555
Bit of a dearth of skin cancers
in London at the moment.

37:00.588 --> 37:04.625
I was sued by a patient.
Old woman in Chiswick.

37:04.659 --> 37:06.326
Cost me an arm and a leg.

37:06.359 --> 37:08.963
-Oh, dear. I didn't hear.
-No, you didn't.

37:09.997 --> 37:11.666
It's my life.
If it goes wrong,

37:11.699 --> 37:13.333
I'd rather it went wrong
in private.

37:14.102 --> 37:16.938
-What happened?
-Forensic fuck-up.

37:16.971 --> 37:18.906
Didn't spot the tumours
for what they were.

37:21.475 --> 37:22.844
Human error.

37:22.877 --> 37:26.013
-And the old woman...
-She's dying.

37:26.047 --> 37:28.448
Ah, sorry.

37:28.482 --> 37:29.951
So, it cost her an arm
and a leg too, then.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.668
The old boy probably
won't know any English.

37:47.702 --> 37:48.736
You speak French, don't you?

37:48.770 --> 37:50.738
Of course,
I speak fucking French.

37:59.346 --> 38:00.548
You sure you're ready for this?

38:10.124 --> 38:11.458
After you.

38:37.618 --> 38:39.352
He says he will speak to me.

38:39.386 --> 38:40.922
Perhaps because
you're not believers.

38:40.955 --> 38:43.390
-Oh, here we go.
-No, it's fine.

38:43.423 --> 38:44.491
Go ahead.

39:18.659 --> 39:20.695
He wants you to return with them
to bury the boy.

39:22.029 --> 39:24.098
What the fuck?

39:24.131 --> 39:26.100
And if you are a man of honour,
you will do it.

39:26.133 --> 39:27.668
It is customary in these parts.

39:27.702 --> 39:29.871
Is it customary in these parts?

39:29.904 --> 39:32.874
These are not the people I know.
They're Berber.

39:32.907 --> 39:35.676
If they say it is their custom,
I have to believe them.

39:35.710 --> 39:37.545
Did he did mention money?

39:37.578 --> 39:40.480
No, but it will be understood.
We don't speak of such things.

39:40.514 --> 39:44.018
-David has to know the amount.
-I cannot ask him that.

39:45.686 --> 39:46.888
Monsieur David just has to take
a certain amount with him.

39:46.921 --> 39:50.091
Monsieur David hasn't agreed
to this absurd plan.

39:50.124 --> 39:53.194
Go back with him to his village?
Are you bonkers?

39:53.227 --> 39:54.929
It may be
you don't have a choice.

39:56.496 --> 39:57.798
He's not entirely asking you.

39:57.832 --> 40:01.102
He's being polite,
but I think he will insist.

40:01.135 --> 40:02.536
Going back to their village
for a night

40:02.570 --> 40:03.638
and paying your respects

40:03.671 --> 40:05.806
would be a bloody sight
easier than anything else.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.074
You'll be back
in a couple of days.

40:07.108 --> 40:08.075
Has it occurred to you, Dicky,

40:08.109 --> 40:10.044
that he might actually
be planning something

40:10.077 --> 40:13.047
a lot nastier than anything
you can anticipate

40:13.080 --> 40:16.550
since he thinks I bunked off
his fucking kid and all that?

40:16.584 --> 40:19.153
-You're exaggerating, monsieur.
-Am I? Am I really?

40:19.186 --> 40:22.156
Yeah. Yeah, you are.
They won't pull any stunts.

40:22.189 --> 40:23.791
They're afraid
of the Moroccan police.

40:23.824 --> 40:26.060
Well they might be fucking ISIS
for all I know.

40:29.230 --> 40:30.932
Are you this paranoid
all the time?

40:32.833 --> 40:35.102
I don't hear
you volunteering, Yank.

40:35.136 --> 40:36.604
That's because
I didn't kill him.

40:36.637 --> 40:37.939
Well I didn't fucking kill him.

40:37.972 --> 40:39.106
He just stepped out
in front of me.

40:39.140 --> 40:42.076
-His name was Driss.
-Yes, I...

40:44.745 --> 40:48.149
Driss. Driss, right.

41:04.532 --> 41:07.601
- What does it matter?
- One way or the other,

41:07.635 --> 41:09.837
everyone thinks
I'm guilty anyway.

41:16.711 --> 41:18.913
What a jolly weekend
this has turned out to be.

41:48.909 --> 41:49.844
How'd it go?

41:52.279 --> 41:54.815
Dicky and the Arab servant

41:54.849 --> 41:58.119
have cooked up
a perfectly wonderful wease.

41:58.152 --> 42:00.621
I'm to go back
with the old geezer

42:00.654 --> 42:01.622
to his village

42:01.655 --> 42:04.725
in the middle of nowhere
and do some atonement.

42:04.759 --> 42:06.227
Fuck that. They could be ISIS
for all we know.

42:06.260 --> 42:10.064
That's what I said.
Didn't go down too well.

42:10.097 --> 42:12.767
-Had to smooth things over.
-What'd you say?

42:17.004 --> 42:18.539
I agreed to go.

42:22.243 --> 42:24.612
Everyone seems to think
it's the only thing to do.

42:25.946 --> 42:27.048
And I imagine
it might get nasty.

42:32.153 --> 42:36.123
-How was he, the father?
-Inscrutable.

42:36.157 --> 42:37.925
And it's just you
that has to go?

42:37.958 --> 42:39.226
Just me.

42:39.260 --> 42:40.094
They're probably worried

42:40.127 --> 42:42.029
you'll get your period
or something.

42:42.063 --> 42:43.898
The man just lost
his son, David.

42:43.931 --> 42:45.599
I'm sure
that they have their rituals

42:45.633 --> 42:47.234
just like everyone else.

42:47.268 --> 42:48.936
Maybe it's a good idea.

42:49.570 --> 42:51.806
We don't want the police
showing up again,

42:51.839 --> 42:53.274
poking their noses
into everything.

42:54.375 --> 42:56.710
No, I suppose we don't.

42:57.546 --> 43:00.681
May I remind you, Jo,
you got into a car with a drunk,

43:00.714 --> 43:03.350
which makes you an accessory
before and after the fact.

43:03.384 --> 43:04.952
Funny that.

43:04.985 --> 43:07.188
Like I've been an accessory
for a long time now.

43:15.996 --> 43:17.364
I'm sure
Richard wouldn't let you go

43:17.398 --> 43:18.632
if there was a risk.

43:19.867 --> 43:22.770
It'll be fine.
A little jolly in the desert.

43:22.803 --> 43:24.972
Might even enjoy myself,
who knows?

43:27.741 --> 43:29.376
Probably just wants closure,
that's all.

43:31.112 --> 43:32.880
That's what people
always want these days.

43:34.081 --> 43:35.950
It's like being
on fucking Oprah.

43:36.750 --> 43:38.219
A bit of an outdated
reference, Oprah.

43:38.252 --> 43:41.155
Was it? Oh, I'm sorry.
I do apologize.

43:41.188 --> 43:43.424
You know, that that's what
he wants, right? The father.

43:43.457 --> 43:46.760
He wants you to apologize,
to say that you're sorry.

43:46.794 --> 43:48.796
Well, I'll say I'm sorry.

43:48.829 --> 43:52.800
-Are you sorry?
-I will say I'm sorry.

44:11.819 --> 44:13.854
Oh, shit. I forgot about--

44:25.332 --> 44:26.767
Oops.

45:01.402 --> 45:03.170
What's in the bag?

45:03.204 --> 45:05.239
Clean shirt, clean socks,
clean underwear.

45:05.272 --> 45:07.908
I feel like I'm being packed off
to boarding school.

45:07.942 --> 45:10.177
Probably going to need
the clean underwear.

45:10.211 --> 45:12.446
Oh, the rent boy made a joke.

45:12.479 --> 45:16.450
-Now, now. Cash?
-A thousand Euros.

45:16.483 --> 45:17.918
That's all they're getting.

45:20.555 --> 45:22.489
Take care out there, stumblebum.

45:32.433 --> 45:36.303
Right. Remember, David,
you can't show fear

45:36.337 --> 45:38.038
or discomfort in front
of these people.

45:38.072 --> 45:39.406
You have to show indifference
to both.

45:39.440 --> 45:41.108
I'll try to bear that in mind.

45:41.141 --> 45:43.777
I expect one of them will
give you a ride back afterwards.

45:43.811 --> 45:46.013
If not, give us a call
and we'll figure something out.

45:46.046 --> 45:47.948
You've got your mobile?

45:47.982 --> 45:49.917
-Will it work out there?
-Of course it will.

46:04.599 --> 46:06.033
Let me know you're all right.

46:09.169 --> 46:10.337
Good luck, old man.

46:19.547 --> 46:21.482
Poor sod.

46:21.516 --> 46:23.150
It'll be a difficult
couple of days.

46:24.018 --> 46:25.819
It'll certainly be
an experience for him.

46:26.987 --> 46:29.023
I'll call in a couple of hours.

46:29.056 --> 46:30.924
Make sure
they haven't raped him.

46:30.958 --> 46:33.260
-Richard...
-Kidding.

46:35.929 --> 46:38.198
-What?
-You're terrible.

47:01.121 --> 47:02.323
Would you like a cigarette?

47:05.192 --> 47:09.163
-French. Not Moroccan shit.
-No, no. Thank you.

47:25.946 --> 47:27.181
Your wife is very pretty.

47:31.118 --> 47:33.087
I will have a gazelle
like that one day.

47:33.120 --> 47:33.954
InshaAllah!

48:11.358 --> 48:15.362
-You don't look like a pirate.
-I'm supposed to be Dionysus.

48:15.396 --> 48:17.431
None of these illiterates
even know who that is.

48:17.464 --> 48:19.466
God of drink and drugs
and madness.

48:21.001 --> 48:22.403
Then I've an audience of one.

48:24.204 --> 48:26.006
What else should I know?

48:26.039 --> 48:29.143
He was once kidnapped
by pirates, hence the reference.

48:29.176 --> 48:30.545
A cult grew up around him.

48:30.578 --> 48:32.680
His followers
were said to be cannibals.

48:32.714 --> 48:35.082
They symbolically ate his flesh
and drank his blood.

48:35.115 --> 48:35.949
No, I'm pretty sure
you're thinking

48:35.983 --> 48:37.317
of Roman Catholics.

48:40.020 --> 48:41.455
Shouldn't you be wearing a toga?

48:42.757 --> 48:44.391
There's getting
into the spirit of the thing

48:44.425 --> 48:46.226
and then there's going too far.

48:47.394 --> 48:49.296
The pirate costume
didn't suit me anyway.

48:49.329 --> 48:50.532
I looked like Johnny Depp.

48:52.634 --> 48:53.434
Much more handsome,

48:53.467 --> 48:56.604
less bloated Johnny Depp,
obviously.

48:56.638 --> 48:57.938
Obviously.

48:59.574 --> 49:01.576
You're a writer,
Dicky was saying?

49:01.609 --> 49:03.110
Not sure about that anymore.

49:03.143 --> 49:06.146
I haven't written a word
in eight years

49:06.180 --> 49:08.182
and all of my books
have been forgotten

49:08.215 --> 49:10.685
by the world's
feckless children.

49:10.718 --> 49:14.154
-And that doesn't bother you?
-It's a relief.

49:16.423 --> 49:19.126
I guess every artistic career

49:19.159 --> 49:20.528
has a few moments of visibility,

49:20.562 --> 49:22.229
followed by a long,
painful descent

49:22.262 --> 49:24.331
into total anonymity.

49:26.200 --> 49:28.502
I'm sure some feckless child
of the future will pick up

49:28.536 --> 49:31.472
one of your books
and rescue you from oblivion.

49:31.506 --> 49:32.674
No one's going to be
reading books in 50 years,

49:32.707 --> 49:34.475
let alone a thousand.

49:34.509 --> 49:37.545
And the children of the future
will all be empty headed clowns,

49:37.579 --> 49:40.180
just like the children
of the present.

49:40.214 --> 49:42.684
Oh, I'm going to go out
on a limb

49:42.717 --> 49:44.184
and assume
you don't have any kids.

49:52.527 --> 49:55.462
What about you,
not about kids, your work?

49:55.496 --> 49:56.731
Ugh.

49:58.666 --> 50:00.267
Financial analyst.

50:03.337 --> 50:07.307
What does a financial analyst
actually do

50:07.341 --> 50:08.776
if they actually do anything?

50:08.810 --> 50:10.778
We buy, we sell...

50:10.812 --> 50:12.479
And every 10 years or so,

50:12.514 --> 50:15.282
you get it all
catastrophically wrong.

50:18.185 --> 50:19.587
I guess that's right.

50:19.621 --> 50:21.589
-Sounds like fun.
-It is.

50:39.473 --> 50:41.241
We are nearing Erfoud,

50:41.275 --> 50:43.811
the largest oasis
in North Africa.

50:43.845 --> 50:46.313
From here come
the royal family of Morocco.

50:46.346 --> 50:49.182
I'm a big fan of royalty,
I always have been.

50:49.851 --> 50:52.319
Prince Andrew,
Mohammed bin Salman,

50:52.352 --> 50:54.054
wonderful people.

50:56.223 --> 50:58.726
He says we will go to the hotel.

50:58.760 --> 51:01.161
No one can drive
across to Alnif in the dark.

51:02.262 --> 51:03.698
I'll take your word for it.

51:19.847 --> 51:22.316
Come on, bunny.
Don't worry, he'll be alright.

51:22.349 --> 51:25.419
He's probably having a joint
with the Ait Kebash as we speak.

51:25.452 --> 51:27.755
They're incorrigible potheads.
He'll be stoned the whole time.

51:27.789 --> 51:29.156
Easy for you to say.

51:29.189 --> 51:30.825
You're not being driven
into the desert

51:30.858 --> 51:32.560
to a place
that you can't pronounce.

51:32.594 --> 51:34.261
Do you know where it is
on the map?

51:34.294 --> 51:36.396
I don't care
where it is on the map.

51:36.430 --> 51:39.099
Fuck him anyway,
ruined my night.

51:39.667 --> 51:41.468
Don't sulk, sweetie.

51:41.501 --> 51:42.904
We'll have a good ol'
fashioned blowout tomorrow

51:42.937 --> 51:44.471
to make up for it.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.742
You know the school
David and I went to,

51:47.775 --> 51:49.276
there was a story
that did the rounds,

51:49.309 --> 51:51.478
bedroom incident
on Parents' Day.

51:51.512 --> 51:53.681
One of the boys started
throwing mice

51:53.715 --> 51:56.383
off the roof top
of the masters down below.

51:56.416 --> 51:59.587
But each mouse was equipped
with a little parachute

51:59.621 --> 52:02.690
decorated with a swastika.

52:02.724 --> 52:06.159
Parachutes didn't work,
obviously.

52:06.193 --> 52:07.829
Poor mice hurtled
to their deaths

52:07.862 --> 52:08.896
against the flagstones

52:08.930 --> 52:10.698
with the swastikas
draped over them.

52:11.866 --> 52:14.167
That's terrible.

52:14.201 --> 52:15.903
Why would someone do
something like that?

52:15.937 --> 52:17.270
Children aren't really
that well-versed

52:17.304 --> 52:19.172
in the principles
of aerodynamics.

52:19.206 --> 52:20.808
No, I mean the swastikas.

52:21.909 --> 52:25.546
Kid was probably vilifying
the masters as Nazi types.

52:25.580 --> 52:27.247
Or he just liked swastikas.

52:28.850 --> 52:30.652
Story was it was David
who did it.

52:32.452 --> 52:36.891
-No, is that true?
-I couldn't say for sure.

52:36.924 --> 52:38.392
Before my time.

52:39.560 --> 52:41.529
But I heard they caned him
for it anyway.

52:41.562 --> 52:42.830
Beat him black and blue.

52:50.337 --> 52:52.372
Now, listen, are you going
to mope all weekend

52:52.406 --> 52:54.441
or are you going
to enjoy yourself?

52:54.474 --> 52:56.511
It's not a crime
to enjoy yourself, you know?

53:02.784 --> 53:04.686
I suppose I can make the effort.

53:04.719 --> 53:06.420
Attagirl!

54:11.786 --> 54:13.487
What are you doing?

54:13.521 --> 54:16.724
It is more fitting.
Please, I'm sure you understand.

54:19.392 --> 54:20.928
I will order your Coke.

54:20.962 --> 54:23.064
There is a room upstairs
where you can sleep.

54:23.097 --> 54:25.666
We rise again at five.
I will come for you.

55:13.881 --> 55:16.617
<i>The person you have dialled</i>
<i>cannot be reached.</i>

55:18.653 --> 55:19.887
Bloody knew it.

55:25.026 --> 55:26.761
<i>Everyone is alive right now.</i>

55:28.930 --> 55:30.865
<i>Everyone's made it this far.</i>

55:32.166 --> 55:34.001
<i>We've all done the worse</i>
<i>kinds of things...</i>

55:34.035 --> 55:35.002
<i>Liar.</i>

55:37.972 --> 55:39.740
Oh, Christ.

55:46.180 --> 55:48.683
Oh, I heard there was
an accident last night.

55:48.716 --> 55:50.117
Was somebody hurt?

55:50.151 --> 55:52.854
Friend of mine from London
got lost on the road,

55:52.887 --> 55:54.722
David Henninger.

55:54.755 --> 55:58.860
Oh, that's who that was.
Thought I recognized him.

55:58.893 --> 56:01.562
One of the Arabs
stepped out in front of him.

56:03.664 --> 56:05.132
Kaput.

56:05.166 --> 56:06.667
Where's Henninger now?

56:06.701 --> 56:08.736
Oh, he sent him
into the desert to die.

56:11.072 --> 56:13.841
-Did you sleep?
-Eventually.

56:13.875 --> 56:15.176
Did you dream?

56:15.209 --> 56:19.446
No. I mean, I...
I can't remember.

56:20.982 --> 56:23.851
-I had a very strange dream.
-Oh yeah?

56:23.885 --> 56:26.453
I dreamed I was...
I was a butterfly.

56:28.488 --> 56:30.925
How do you know
that you are not a butterfly...

56:32.560 --> 56:34.095
dreaming that you are a man?

56:35.830 --> 56:38.699
-Hmm I like that.
-Well, it's not one of mine.

56:38.733 --> 56:40.835
Chinese fellow said it.

57:19.173 --> 57:20.541
Yes?

57:20.574 --> 57:23.144
Madame. Monsieur Day
has sent you a card.

57:23.177 --> 57:25.046
You can leave it on the table.

57:25.079 --> 57:27.515
Monsieur Day says
I must wait for a reply.

57:29.517 --> 57:31.819
-You serious?
-Yes, madame.

57:34.689 --> 57:36.190
You can call me mademoiselle.

57:51.806 --> 57:55.977
Papayas for breakfast,
how the hell do they do it?

57:56.010 --> 57:58.079
No point in having contacts
in the Ministry of Interior

57:58.112 --> 57:59.947
if you can't get a fresh papaya.

58:01.315 --> 58:04.251
-What happened to the raw egg?
-Couldn't stomach it.

58:06.087 --> 58:07.221
Boosts your libido.

58:08.289 --> 58:10.725
My libido's fine,
Mrs. Henninger.

58:13.294 --> 58:16.731
There's a picnic today.
We should go.

58:19.734 --> 58:21.702
We should go?

58:21.736 --> 58:24.005
Heard your husband's gone AWOL.

58:24.038 --> 58:27.875
I'm just offering my services
as an... escort.

58:29.043 --> 58:31.112
How very gallant of you.

58:31.379 --> 58:33.047
It's an oasis somewhere.

58:33.080 --> 58:34.982
Maybe there'd be a waterfall.

58:35.016 --> 58:36.717
Everyone likes waterfalls.

58:36.751 --> 58:39.320
And this would involve swimming,
I assume?

58:39.353 --> 58:41.122
Hope so.

58:41.155 --> 58:43.657
The voyeurs among us
want to see you in a swimsuit.

58:45.760 --> 58:47.061
Not very subtle.

58:47.995 --> 58:50.297
I'm from New York,
subtly gets you fined there.

58:52.767 --> 58:56.170
I won't fine you, maybe a little
corporal punishment.

58:56.470 --> 58:57.905
Corporal punishment?

58:59.340 --> 59:04.245
Now I'm beginning to feel
a vague stirring of interest.

59:04.278 --> 59:06.614
Vague, stirring,
vague, stirring?

59:08.082 --> 59:09.183
I need something
a little more concrete

59:09.216 --> 59:10.351
than vague stirring.

59:10.384 --> 59:12.686
I'll talk to my people.
They'll talk to their people.

59:12.720 --> 59:14.889
We'll get back to you.

59:14.922 --> 59:18.125
And there I was hoping
for a hostile takeover.

01:00:53.721 --> 01:00:55.055
As-salamu alaykum!

01:01:07.401 --> 01:01:10.871
Oh. Orthoceras.

01:01:32.226 --> 01:01:35.362
He says you cannot drink
from the same cup.

01:01:35.863 --> 01:01:38.866
You cannot eat
from the same plate.

01:01:38.899 --> 01:01:40.801
He says your shadow
must not cross.

01:01:42.136 --> 01:01:46.340
-Is that a custom?
-No, just his way right now.

01:01:47.474 --> 01:01:50.311
-It will pass.
-Alright.

01:02:00.487 --> 01:02:02.156
It has been sent
all the way to Norway.

01:02:03.224 --> 01:02:04.925
Coffee table.

01:02:04.959 --> 01:02:06.493
It is incredible
that wealthy men

01:02:06.528 --> 01:02:07.995
collect such things.

01:02:08.028 --> 01:02:10.898
Wealthy men collect
a lot of stupid bullshit.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:14.468
The renovation
of a single bathroom

01:02:14.501 --> 01:02:16.937
can keep a Saharan village
alive for a year.

01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:22.009
The desert is what we fish,
and the fossils are our fish.

01:02:25.246 --> 01:02:28.849
It is a joke.
God has played a joke on us.

01:02:30.384 --> 01:02:33.320
-Does it make you laugh?
-No, not at all.

01:02:33.354 --> 01:02:34.989
-Makes you laugh?
-No.

01:02:35.022 --> 01:02:36.156
Makes me laugh.

01:02:37.525 --> 01:02:39.159
Soon there will be nothing here.

01:02:40.828 --> 01:02:43.264
No people, no trees.
We are the last ones.

01:02:44.064 --> 01:02:47.368
We have fossils
and our children.

01:02:48.536 --> 01:02:50.037
And nothing else.

01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:18.198
ISIS control this part
of the desert.

01:03:18.232 --> 01:03:21.168
That's very encouraging to hear.

01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:22.970
Marvellous.

01:03:23.003 --> 01:03:25.139
We will drive around Issomour
to arrive to Tafal'aalt.

01:03:25.172 --> 01:03:27.509
-It is the back way.
-Why the back way?

01:03:28.643 --> 01:03:30.944
It's the old man's choice.

01:03:30.978 --> 01:03:33.147
So, it'll add hours to the trip.

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.349
No, I wouldn't say so long.

01:03:35.382 --> 01:03:36.884
We should be there soon enough.

01:03:39.019 --> 01:03:40.555
Why are you looking
at your watch?

01:03:42.156 --> 01:03:43.924
I don't know.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.301
What?

01:03:55.537 --> 01:03:57.171
It was his only son.

01:03:58.238 --> 01:03:59.940
It was his only child.

01:04:03.043 --> 01:04:06.947
Well... the world
is a dreadful place,

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.349
my father used to say.

01:04:10.451 --> 01:04:14.455
And the best you can do
is make fun of it.

01:04:18.459 --> 01:04:21.529
Here's my best Buster Keaton.

01:04:21.563 --> 01:04:23.631
Here's when he's young...

01:04:23.665 --> 01:04:26.634
Here's when he's old.
See the difference?

01:04:27.702 --> 01:04:29.303
They say you throw
the best parties

01:04:29.336 --> 01:04:31.338
-east of Marrakesh.
-Correction.

01:04:31.372 --> 01:04:34.007
The best parties
in the whole North Africa.

01:04:34.041 --> 01:04:36.310
-Is that good?
-I got it.

01:04:36.343 --> 01:04:39.012
Dally. Could you get
everybody moving?

01:04:39.046 --> 01:04:41.448
Quicker we get there the better.
It's too bloody hot.

01:04:45.052 --> 01:04:46.521
- Oasis time.
- Dicky.

01:04:46.554 --> 01:04:47.388
Darling.

01:04:47.421 --> 01:04:48.656
As I live and breathe.

01:07:17.204 --> 01:07:19.273
You know, Dally and I
come down here

01:07:19.306 --> 01:07:21.609
nearly every day,
and every time I remember

01:07:21.643 --> 01:07:23.410
- why I'm not in London.
- Do you sing a song to Pan

01:07:23.443 --> 01:07:25.178
as you stroll along?

01:07:25.212 --> 01:07:28.282
-And other Gods too.
-Mammon, right? He was a god.

01:07:28.315 --> 01:07:31.285
The Phoenicians didn't make it
quite this far west, Tom.

01:07:31.318 --> 01:07:35.590
Oh, of course. The Phoenicians.
How stupid of me.

01:07:35.623 --> 01:07:38.392
Asshole.

01:07:38.425 --> 01:07:40.427
Did I tell you
I have a house in Bali?

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:42.329
And you own
a Kandinsky too, right?

01:07:43.363 --> 01:07:44.431
It does sound like a line.

01:07:45.633 --> 01:07:46.668
What is it you like about Bali?

01:07:48.836 --> 01:07:51.573
The hot weather
cheap restaurants.

01:07:52.874 --> 01:07:54.709
I thought Mick Jagger
lived there

01:07:54.742 --> 01:07:57.377
and then it turned out
he didn't.

01:07:57.411 --> 01:08:00.447
-Girlfriend?
-Not in Bali.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.517
I thought all white men
had a girlfriend in Asia.

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:03.350
Not me.

01:08:04.284 --> 01:08:07.855
Mmm, I'm sure you have
a few sluts on the side.

01:08:07.889 --> 01:08:11.224
A little judgmental,
of both me and the sluts.

01:08:11.258 --> 01:08:13.493
I'm not judging anyone.
I think men need sluts.

01:08:14.562 --> 01:08:16.162
I think women need to be sluts.

01:08:17.464 --> 01:08:19.332
They can't seem
to manage otherwise,

01:08:19.366 --> 01:08:21.234
except when they're drunk,
of course.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:25.807
Maybe you don't know
how to ask.

01:08:28.643 --> 01:08:32.279
-Me personally?
-Yeah, you personally.

01:08:45.225 --> 01:08:47.194
You've forgotten
about my husband.

01:08:47.227 --> 01:08:49.663
-Yes, I have.
-And so have you.

01:11:29.857 --> 01:11:31.358
Was that the mother?

01:11:31.391 --> 01:11:34.562
No, no.
She died many years ago.

01:11:34.595 --> 01:11:36.363
-Aunts and a cousin.
-Hmm.

01:11:48.109 --> 01:11:49.911
This is Driss' room.

01:11:51.779 --> 01:11:53.480
There is no other room
for you to sleep in.

01:11:54.615 --> 01:11:56.617
Abdellah want you
to feel his spirit here.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:00.387
He thinks it is more fitting.

01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:04.792
I'm going to the burial now.

01:12:04.826 --> 01:12:06.861
-Does Abdellah want me to--
-No, no, no.

01:12:07.895 --> 01:12:09.931
While I am away you should
keep your door bolted.

01:12:09.964 --> 01:12:11.132
What?

01:12:11.165 --> 01:12:13.634
The women. Grief.

01:14:59.166 --> 01:15:00.568
What have you done?

01:15:16.684 --> 01:15:17.952
What the fuck are you doing?

01:16:48.109 --> 01:16:49.076
Hungry?

01:16:55.116 --> 01:16:57.218
-What meat is this?
-Goat.

01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.989
-It's good.
-Fresh.

01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:05.025
Abdellah only killed
the animal an hour ago.

01:17:18.339 --> 01:17:21.108
The diggers are returning
from the mountain.

01:17:21.142 --> 01:17:22.877
They come back when it's dark,

01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:25.045
when they can no longer see
what they are doing.

01:17:25.079 --> 01:17:27.848
So, they work from dawn to dusk.

01:17:29.016 --> 01:17:30.751
It's a nice phrase
until you think

01:17:30.784 --> 01:17:32.153
what it actually means.

01:17:34.054 --> 01:17:35.990
Why did you agree
to come back here, David?

01:17:37.424 --> 01:17:40.027
I don't know, I suppose...

01:17:42.429 --> 01:17:44.932
I suppose I wanted
to cross the bridge

01:17:46.066 --> 01:17:47.768
and have done with things.

01:17:53.374 --> 01:17:55.776
Abdellah will come by soon
to have a talk with you.

01:17:58.812 --> 01:18:00.281
Is he coming with a knife?

01:18:10.124 --> 01:18:11.792
I haven't done this in years.

01:18:11.825 --> 01:18:13.494
This is A-force snow
from Marseilles.

01:18:13.528 --> 01:18:15.996
It's a rather boring drug
I find.

01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:18.799
I plowed through heaps of it
with John Paul Getty...

01:18:18.832 --> 01:18:22.436
or old one ear
as I liked to call him.

01:18:22.469 --> 01:18:25.339
I only do it now
because Maribel insists.

01:18:25.372 --> 01:18:27.074
You're such a liar.

01:18:28.242 --> 01:18:29.777
You look fucking hot tonight
by the way.

01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:31.912
That's just the coke talking.

01:18:31.946 --> 01:18:34.882
I think it's good you've got
some time to yourself, Jo.

01:18:34.915 --> 01:18:36.083
I think you needed it.

01:18:36.116 --> 01:18:38.085
It would be great
if I wasn't so worried.

01:18:43.057 --> 01:18:44.758
You know
you'll never be accepted here,

01:18:44.792 --> 01:18:46.093
don't you, Dicky?

01:18:46.126 --> 01:18:48.195
Being an infidel and all.

01:18:49.230 --> 01:18:51.031
Why should they accept them?

01:18:51.065 --> 01:18:53.000
They have every reason
to hate them.

01:18:53.033 --> 01:18:55.069
I'd have thought they'd have
more reason to hate you.

01:18:55.102 --> 01:18:57.838
France has excellent relations
with the Arabs.

01:18:57.871 --> 01:18:59.974
We share the Mediterranean
with them.

01:19:00.007 --> 01:19:02.476
-But you wouldn't understand.
-I understand.

01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:04.144
You mean you have them
in your ghettos...

01:19:04.178 --> 01:19:06.080
so you feel close to them,
but do you feel close to them...

01:19:06.113 --> 01:19:08.182
when they're burning cars
in the suburbs

01:19:08.215 --> 01:19:09.984
and ransacking your synagogues?

01:19:10.017 --> 01:19:12.920
That is just, how do you say,
a probleme social?

01:19:12.953 --> 01:19:14.421
No, they dislike you
for the same reason

01:19:14.455 --> 01:19:15.856
they dislike us.

01:19:15.889 --> 01:19:17.491
We're not Muslims
and we lord it over them.

01:19:17.525 --> 01:19:18.892
It's against what they regard

01:19:18.926 --> 01:19:20.094
as the natural order
of things

01:19:20.127 --> 01:19:22.463
which would be
them lording over us.

01:19:22.496 --> 01:19:24.532
I don't hold it
against them though.

01:19:24.566 --> 01:19:26.200
They're rival imperialists.

01:19:26.233 --> 01:19:28.802
But in America, Muslims
are peaceful and prosperous.

01:19:28.836 --> 01:19:29.903
They don't spend their time

01:19:29.937 --> 01:19:32.239
rioting and pelting police cars
with garbage cans.

01:19:32.273 --> 01:19:34.074
How come they only do that
in France?

01:19:34.108 --> 01:19:38.846
It must be,
how do you say, solidarité.

01:19:38.879 --> 01:19:41.382
You are killing
hundreds of thousands

01:19:41.415 --> 01:19:44.385
-in Iraq and Afghanistan...
-No, we're not, darling.

01:19:44.418 --> 01:19:46.987
-The Mujahideen are.
-Okay, okay, okay.

01:19:47.021 --> 01:19:48.889
Listen, honey, we understand...

01:19:48.922 --> 01:19:51.158
that when in doubt Americans
must be blamed.

01:19:51.191 --> 01:19:53.160
We would miss it
if you didn't blame us.

01:19:53.193 --> 01:19:54.295
We're masochists
is what you're saying.

01:19:54.328 --> 01:19:55.963
Yeah, we enjoy it.
It makes us feel

01:19:55.996 --> 01:19:57.565
more important
than we actually are.

01:19:57.599 --> 01:20:00.067
Blame us less and we'd be
a lot more humble.

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:00.934
We wouldn't think that

01:20:00.968 --> 01:20:03.137
we were actually
the centre of the world.

01:20:03.170 --> 01:20:04.872
I don't believe you.

01:20:04.905 --> 01:20:07.207
You always think
you're the centre of the world.

01:20:07.241 --> 01:20:09.009
You fucking Americans!

01:20:11.011 --> 01:20:12.179
What do you think, Hamid?

01:20:13.314 --> 01:20:17.384
The tongue has no bones, Sir,
but it crushes all the same.

01:21:42.737 --> 01:21:44.104
Is it good?

01:21:45.305 --> 01:21:46.641
It's an apple.

01:21:49.343 --> 01:21:50.678
You speak English.

01:21:55.416 --> 01:21:57.084
Well, I guess the joke's on me.

01:21:58.586 --> 01:22:01.188
There is something
I want to show you.

01:22:20.775 --> 01:22:24.512
The fossil Driss was carrying
when he was hit by your car.

01:22:31.418 --> 01:22:33.454
It was recovered by the police.

01:22:35.088 --> 01:22:38.959
They returned it to me
because it is so valuable.

01:22:40.194 --> 01:22:45.733
It is called an Elvis.
An Elvis?

01:22:45.767 --> 01:22:50.003
Only three specimens
have been found in the Sahara...

01:22:51.038 --> 01:22:54.609
and the dealers decided
to give it the name of Elvis...

01:22:55.209 --> 01:22:57.745
because it is a superstar.

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:01.982
Driss stole it from me.

01:23:04.051 --> 01:23:06.453
This happens all the time.

01:23:08.322 --> 01:23:12.259
The young boys are frustrated.

01:23:13.728 --> 01:23:16.664
They feel they're going nowhere.

01:23:17.732 --> 01:23:20.067
And have no hopes.

01:23:21.769 --> 01:23:24.506
They don't want to be diggers
all their lives.

01:23:25.773 --> 01:23:28.543
They don't want to live
like their fathers.

01:23:29.711 --> 01:23:31.546
They want to escape.

01:23:33.681 --> 01:23:35.517
So, they steal an Elvis...

01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:39.319
which they know will sell
for $10,000

01:23:39.353 --> 01:23:41.021
in the United States.

01:23:42.757 --> 01:23:44.726
If they can sell it
to a foreigner

01:23:44.759 --> 01:23:46.594
for 1,000 Euros...

01:23:48.195 --> 01:23:52.634
they can go to Casablanca,
start a new life...

01:23:58.806 --> 01:24:02.175
Casablanca is full
of loose women.

01:24:03.811 --> 01:24:08.348
And 1,000 Euros
will get you a long way

01:24:09.249 --> 01:24:10.484
with a loose woman.

01:24:15.823 --> 01:24:18.325
I didn't mind when I found out

01:24:18.358 --> 01:24:20.460
that Driss had stolen it
from me.

01:24:21.896 --> 01:24:23.497
I understood him.

01:24:25.399 --> 01:24:28.570
And in a way,
I wished them luck.

01:24:30.672 --> 01:24:32.740
It's only a fossil after all.

01:24:34.274 --> 01:24:37.311
A lump of rock. Literally.

01:24:40.648 --> 01:24:44.752
If he had sold it to you
for a few hundred Euros...

01:24:50.925 --> 01:24:53.427
I would have been happy
for him.

01:24:56.864 --> 01:24:58.398
Really happy.

01:25:00.868 --> 01:25:03.236
How much better
it would have been...

01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:05.640
if you had stopped
and bought the damn thing.

01:25:06.874 --> 01:25:08.610
You would now be in Azna...

01:25:08.643 --> 01:25:10.745
drinking cocktails
with your wife.

01:25:12.013 --> 01:25:15.717
And Driss would be in Casablanca
in the arms of a loose woman.

01:25:20.354 --> 01:25:22.724
I'm sorry about what happened.

01:25:27.762 --> 01:25:29.463
I'm very sorry.

01:25:32.967 --> 01:25:35.369
But it was a terrible accident.

01:26:00.595 --> 01:26:03.931
I have no idea why you people
have such a thirst

01:26:03.965 --> 01:26:06.333
for these stupid rocks.

01:26:08.002 --> 01:26:09.937
What do you see in them?

01:26:13.941 --> 01:26:16.243
All we know is that
you want them

01:26:16.276 --> 01:26:18.780
and are prepared
to pay money for them.

01:26:22.482 --> 01:26:24.451
Some of us believe...

01:26:25.285 --> 01:26:28.690
that these are the most
evil creatures

01:26:28.723 --> 01:26:30.525
that ever existed...

01:26:32.426 --> 01:26:36.296
that they are the forms
of dead demons.

01:26:38.833 --> 01:26:41.803
That is what they look like,
you must admit.

01:26:44.539 --> 01:26:48.609
They must have an influence
on our minds.

01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:53.548
An influence that is evil.

01:26:56.884 --> 01:26:59.453
And that's what attracts you
to them.

01:27:09.296 --> 01:27:10.732
It's all a mystery.

01:27:13.601 --> 01:27:17.304
Driss took my Elvis and ran...

01:27:18.973 --> 01:27:21.341
and the next person he saw

01:27:22.643 --> 01:27:23.978
was you.

01:28:10.825 --> 01:28:13.628
Hey, get this cunt
the fuck off me, will ya?

01:28:52.399 --> 01:28:54.068
This is how you open
a bottle of champagne.

01:28:54.101 --> 01:28:57.572
You hold it firmly
by the base...

01:28:57.605 --> 01:28:59.907
you turn the bottle,
not the cork.

01:28:59.941 --> 01:29:01.441
Red wine should be held
by the neck,

01:29:01.474 --> 01:29:02.643
a woman by the waist

01:29:02.677 --> 01:29:05.146
and a bottle of champagne
by the derriere.

01:29:05.179 --> 01:29:07.014
Mark Twain, very good.

01:29:07.048 --> 01:29:09.750
Of course, those priorities
can be rearranged later.

01:29:09.784 --> 01:29:10.985
Glad to hear it.

01:29:14.121 --> 01:29:15.590
I feel like
I've been a little phony

01:29:15.623 --> 01:29:16.591
with you in some way.

01:29:17.959 --> 01:29:19.760
Playing a part.
It's not me at all.

01:29:19.794 --> 01:29:21.028
This isn't me either.

01:29:22.763 --> 01:29:24.065
You know...

01:29:24.098 --> 01:29:26.067
I didn't want to meet
a married woman...

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.536
just 'cause I thought
she'd be quick and--

01:29:28.569 --> 01:29:30.437
We have our uses, don't we?

01:31:50.177 --> 01:31:53.614
Hello? Hello?

01:32:17.171 --> 01:32:18.072
Good morning.

01:32:31.986 --> 01:32:34.288
I'm sorry, I don't speak Arabic.

01:32:34.321 --> 01:32:36.123
Or Tamazight, I suppose,
is the dialect.

01:33:13.894 --> 01:33:15.729
I see you come out for a walk.

01:33:17.164 --> 01:33:21.235
Of course, you saw there's
nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

01:33:21.268 --> 01:33:24.672
I wasn't trying to run or hide.
My things are all back--

01:33:55.469 --> 01:33:57.338
Anouar will take you back
to Azna.

01:34:56.263 --> 01:34:57.298
There you are.

01:35:24.158 --> 01:35:25.926
Bit early in the day.

01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:28.996
I haven't been to bed yet.

01:35:29.029 --> 01:35:30.331
It's the gear for you.

01:35:31.432 --> 01:35:35.102
-Been for a swim?
-I feel rejuvenated.

01:35:35.135 --> 01:35:36.971
So awake I'm dangerous.

01:35:37.004 --> 01:35:38.906
Run with it.
It won't last forever.

01:35:40.841 --> 01:35:44.111
-What else have I missed?
-I got waylaid by a Greek god.

01:35:46.447 --> 01:35:49.083
And what does that mean exactly?

01:35:49.116 --> 01:35:50.851
It means,

01:35:50.884 --> 01:35:54.288
I've committed adultery
with a ridiculous man...

01:35:54.321 --> 01:35:55.389
as women always do.

01:35:55.422 --> 01:35:57.992
Yeah, well, such things
have been known to happen.

01:35:58.025 --> 01:35:59.493
Not to me.

01:35:59.527 --> 01:36:02.229
I'm glad.
Don't mean about Tom.

01:36:03.464 --> 01:36:05.799
I mean about you.
Knocked David of his perch.

01:36:05.833 --> 01:36:08.302
-That's a good thing, isn't it?
-I wasn't thinking about David.

01:36:08.335 --> 01:36:10.204
I was just thinking
about myself for once.

01:36:14.074 --> 01:36:18.178
-Are you going to divorce him?
-I think I have to.

01:36:20.247 --> 01:36:21.382
Might be for the best.

01:36:22.916 --> 01:36:26.253
You didn't seem very happy.
Didn't seem like you.

01:36:28.623 --> 01:36:31.025
Guess we were an obvious couple.

01:36:31.058 --> 01:36:33.427
All couples are rather
obvious in the end.

01:36:33.762 --> 01:36:37.097
-Twelve years after all.
-Twelve years.

01:36:38.132 --> 01:36:40.434
I guess it doesn't seem
that long when you say it fast.

01:36:45.507 --> 01:36:49.209
I was thinking none of this
would have happened...

01:36:49.243 --> 01:36:51.078
if we hadn't killed that boy.

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:55.583
-It would have just carried on.
-Driss?

01:36:57.251 --> 01:36:58.852
Boy's name was Driss.

01:37:03.157 --> 01:37:04.325
But you knew that already.

01:37:08.262 --> 01:37:09.564
Driss Taheri.

01:37:11.633 --> 01:37:13.334
What did you do with his ID,
bury it?

01:37:17.304 --> 01:37:19.340
- David, what the fuck?
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:37:19.373 --> 01:37:20.608
What the fuck are you doing?

01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:23.977
That's all in the past.

01:37:28.349 --> 01:37:30.250
The important thing is now,
isn't it?

01:38:46.126 --> 01:38:47.995
What cereal do you eat
in the morning?

01:38:48.028 --> 01:38:50.632
I don't eat breakfast.
I'm usually too hungover.

01:38:51.766 --> 01:38:54.101
I prefer cornflakes myself.

01:38:54.134 --> 01:38:56.470
It is one good thing
that you have given us,

01:38:56.503 --> 01:38:58.238
apart from ice.

01:38:58.673 --> 01:39:00.240
I'm glad you like ice.

01:39:01.108 --> 01:39:04.311
I like everything that is cool,
cold and fresh.

01:39:05.713 --> 01:39:07.347
You think I like to live
in this furnace?

01:39:09.216 --> 01:39:11.586
You think I like the camels,
the palm trees...

01:39:11.619 --> 01:39:14.656
and the 104 degrees
every morning? Huh?

01:39:15.557 --> 01:39:17.491
No, not at all.

01:39:19.326 --> 01:39:20.762
I dream of Sweden
most of the time.

01:39:20.795 --> 01:39:21.629
Sweden?

01:39:23.363 --> 01:39:25.999
Yeah. I've seen it
in a colour magazine.

01:39:27.234 --> 01:39:29.203
A fantastic place,
by the looks of it.

01:39:31.305 --> 01:39:33.106
It is the place
I would most like to live.

01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:36.376
Must be so deliciously
cold there.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.049
But the world does not promise
anything to anyone...

01:39:43.450 --> 01:39:45.587
and no man ever lived
the way he wished.

01:40:50.417 --> 01:40:53.821
-Goats in a tree.
-It's a fraud, David.

01:40:53.855 --> 01:40:55.790
They don't climb up there
on their own.

01:40:55.823 --> 01:40:57.324
The old man in the shop
will come out...

01:40:57.357 --> 01:40:59.326
and ask you if you'd like
your picture taken.

01:40:59.359 --> 01:41:01.629
For a very small fee, of course.

01:41:01.663 --> 01:41:03.565
Crooks, David.
Tricksters.

01:41:05.833 --> 01:41:08.268
- Breakfast!
- Where'd you get that?

01:41:15.242 --> 01:41:17.545
-It's good, huh?
-It's good.

01:41:46.306 --> 01:41:48.442
Do you think
Abdellah has forgiven me?

01:41:50.778 --> 01:41:52.412
He could tell
that you were sorry.

01:41:54.849 --> 01:41:56.183
He judged you to be sincere.

01:42:03.490 --> 01:42:07.361
-But does he forgive me?
-I'm sure of it.

01:42:08.696 --> 01:42:10.698
He must have forgiven you.

01:42:10.732 --> 01:42:13.568
Otherwise you and I would not
be drinking tea here in Alnif.

01:42:17.304 --> 01:42:18.338
Anouar...

01:42:19.707 --> 01:42:21.141
It was my fault.

01:42:22.577 --> 01:42:23.544
The accident.

01:42:24.846 --> 01:42:26.914
It was 100% my fault.

01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:31.753
I had been drinking all day.

01:42:33.888 --> 01:42:35.455
I was driving too fast.

01:42:37.659 --> 01:42:39.326
I was arguing with my wife.

01:42:41.763 --> 01:42:43.430
Driss did nothing wrong...

01:42:43.463 --> 01:42:46.634
except step into the road
to try to make us slow down.

01:42:55.009 --> 01:42:56.611
It was my fault.

01:43:04.819 --> 01:43:05.787
Anouar...

01:43:08.890 --> 01:43:10.257
It was my fault.

01:43:51.566 --> 01:43:53.400
Time to say goodbye, my friend.

01:43:54.969 --> 01:43:56.537
Goodbye.

01:44:25.332 --> 01:44:26.266
Why?

01:44:27.802 --> 01:44:28.870
No reason.

01:44:30.437 --> 01:44:31.438
Well, for Sweden.

01:44:36.878 --> 01:44:38.746
You're a decent man, Anouar.

01:44:40.581 --> 01:44:42.784
And you, David.
You are an honourable one.

01:45:16.684 --> 01:45:19.086
-Richard sent you?
-No, I saw the jeep.

01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:21.923
So much for the
welcoming committee.

01:45:24.391 --> 01:45:25.325
Mrs. Henninger.

01:45:26.627 --> 01:45:28.395
I believe
she's in her room, sir.

01:45:28.428 --> 01:45:29.597
David.

01:45:30.598 --> 01:45:31.732
I never did ask your name.

01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:35.402
-Hamid.
-Cheers, Hamid.

01:46:00.427 --> 01:46:02.897
I knew Henninger a while back.

01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:04.632
Never liked him much.

01:46:04.665 --> 01:46:05.900
We went to the same school.

01:46:06.767 --> 01:46:10.605
He was one of the old boys,
somewhat notorious.

01:46:10.638 --> 01:46:11.973
Really?

01:46:12.006 --> 01:46:14.675
Did he lark about?
Unnatural practices?

01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:17.645
No, nothing of that sort.

01:46:17.678 --> 01:46:19.580
More of an agitator apparently.

01:46:20.915 --> 01:46:22.783
I was told he once put out
a newspaper called

01:46:22.817 --> 01:46:24.852
England without Darkies.

01:46:26.486 --> 01:46:29.190
The spoofs about people
feeling ashamed of their

01:46:29.223 --> 01:46:30.791
thinly veiled racism.

01:46:30.825 --> 01:46:33.661
He should consider republishing.

01:46:33.694 --> 01:46:35.428
No thin veils anymore.

01:46:35.462 --> 01:46:37.765
-So he was a lefty then?
-I suppose so.

01:46:41.802 --> 01:46:44.504
Do you think they buried
the Arab boy, all right?

01:46:44.538 --> 01:46:45.139
Assume so.

01:46:46.741 --> 01:46:47.875
It's the way they do
things here.

01:46:47.909 --> 01:46:49.844
Brush them under the carpet.

01:46:49.877 --> 01:46:51.679
No one wants any trouble
in the end.

01:46:52.813 --> 01:46:54.115
I expect poor David...

01:46:54.148 --> 01:46:55.616
had to bribe them up
to the hilt.

01:46:55.650 --> 01:46:57.818
Silly bugger.
Cars do have brakes, you know?

01:46:59.253 --> 01:47:00.821
It's been my attitude all along.

01:47:12.733 --> 01:47:14.101
What?

01:47:20.141 --> 01:47:22.109
-What is this?
-A souvenir.

01:47:34.755 --> 01:47:35.723
What happened out there?

01:47:38.092 --> 01:47:39.927
The father wanted to talk to me,
that's all.

01:47:42.029 --> 01:47:43.664
- Did he ask for money?
- No.

01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.902
I gave it to them anyway.

01:47:50.938 --> 01:47:52.139
You find that hard to believe.

01:47:54.675 --> 01:47:57.477
I don't know.
Yeah, I'm a little surprised.

01:48:01.082 --> 01:48:02.482
Anyway.

01:48:07.288 --> 01:48:09.023
It's over.

01:48:12.727 --> 01:48:13.728
Bags in cars.

01:48:15.730 --> 01:48:17.198
Over here.

01:48:17.231 --> 01:48:20.067
Okay, that's it.
Cheese! Okay.

01:48:20.768 --> 01:48:21.769
Is that it?

01:48:21.802 --> 01:48:22.303
-That's it.
-Yeah.

01:48:22.336 --> 01:48:23.604
Ciao, bambina.

01:48:27.041 --> 01:48:28.609
Thank you, boys. Ciao.

01:48:33.714 --> 01:48:35.249
Flowers, please, Dally.

01:48:35.282 --> 01:48:37.785
Shame we didn't get
any alone time.

01:48:37.818 --> 01:48:39.720
Maybe just as well.

01:48:39.754 --> 01:48:41.689
Give my best to Jo for me,
will you?

01:48:41.722 --> 01:48:43.958
-You know how I hate goodbyes.
-Oh yeah, Tom. I know that.

01:48:45.826 --> 01:48:48.796
-What are you doing?
-I need a ride to Casablanca.

01:48:48.829 --> 01:48:49.830
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

01:48:49.864 --> 01:48:51.665
What have you done
for me lately?

01:48:51.699 --> 01:48:54.568
Mate, I can suck a golf ball
through a fucking garden hose.

01:48:54.602 --> 01:48:57.038
Yeah, that's what they all say.
Get in.

01:49:01.075 --> 01:49:03.878
-See you at Azrou for dinner.
-We'll order the trout.

01:49:05.746 --> 01:49:07.214
Maribel, get your pretty
little bottom moving.

01:49:07.248 --> 01:49:08.783
People are waiting.

01:49:10.084 --> 01:49:12.653
- And where are you two off to?
- Tinghir.

01:49:12.686 --> 01:49:15.256
The hotel de Sud
or whatever it's called.

01:49:15.289 --> 01:49:17.725
Maribel wants to experience
the desert,

01:49:17.758 --> 01:49:20.327
whatever the fuck that means.
It was a great party, Dicky.

01:49:20.361 --> 01:49:22.296
Delighted you could make it,
your lordship.

01:49:22.329 --> 01:49:24.632
I'd never throw
these kinds of parties myself...

01:49:24.665 --> 01:49:26.667
unless orgies could be arranged.

01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:29.770
Alas, the age of orgies
appears to have ended.

01:49:29.804 --> 01:49:32.106
Arrivederci.

01:49:32.139 --> 01:49:33.140
-Ciao.
-Ciao, ciao, bambino.

01:49:33.174 --> 01:49:35.242
Good to see ya!

01:49:53.194 --> 01:49:54.795
You were having a nightmare.

01:49:58.265 --> 01:49:59.066
Yes.

01:50:02.970 --> 01:50:04.605
So, why didn't you wake me?

01:50:05.439 --> 01:50:06.340
Oh, I thought...

01:50:06.373 --> 01:50:08.309
you're not supposed
to wake people up--

01:50:09.443 --> 01:50:11.679
That's sleepwalking, isn't it?

01:50:13.047 --> 01:50:13.881
Sorry.

01:50:16.083 --> 01:50:17.952
I was dreaming I was inside...

01:50:19.753 --> 01:50:21.689
a giant Boeing turbine.

01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:26.127
And I was supposed
to clean the blades.

01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:28.129
All I had was a toothbrush.

01:50:29.296 --> 01:50:31.832
Suddenly, the turbines
began to spin...

01:50:33.167 --> 01:50:35.136
and I was shredded.

01:50:36.871 --> 01:50:38.639
How do you know
it was a Boeing turbine?

01:50:40.941 --> 01:50:42.009
Good question.

01:50:44.411 --> 01:50:45.880
You inspired?

01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:49.850
Yeah, I have an idea
for a new book.

01:50:52.753 --> 01:50:53.988
Congratulations.

01:50:58.726 --> 01:51:00.761
You know, we're more than happy
for you to stay an extra night.

01:51:00.794 --> 01:51:03.797
Makes more sense for you
to start out early tomorrow.

01:51:03.831 --> 01:51:06.300
No, I slept all afternoon.
We'll drive through the night...

01:51:06.333 --> 01:51:09.003
and get back to Tangier
in a single leap I think.

01:51:09.036 --> 01:51:09.870
I know what you're thinking,

01:51:09.904 --> 01:51:12.039
but lightning
doesn't strike twice.

01:51:12.072 --> 01:51:14.175
Yeah, it does.

01:51:14.208 --> 01:51:16.877
Well, we fixed the car
as best we could.

01:51:16.911 --> 01:51:18.279
There's a picnic hamper
in the back seat.

01:51:18.312 --> 01:51:20.080
The booze is nonalcoholic.

01:51:23.284 --> 01:51:24.185
Anyway...

01:51:27.254 --> 01:51:28.923
It's all ended
peacefully enough.

01:51:30.257 --> 01:51:31.959
Not for the boy, I know, but...

01:51:32.893 --> 01:51:35.829
for everyone else
it could have been a lot worse.

01:51:35.863 --> 01:51:37.865
They have any interest
in carpets

01:51:37.898 --> 01:51:39.266
out there out in the desert?

01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:41.202
I've never seen anything
from that far out.

01:51:41.235 --> 01:51:43.270
I didn't notice the carpets.

01:51:43.304 --> 01:51:45.272
Did you see Tom
before he got off?

01:51:45.306 --> 01:51:46.106
No.

01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:47.875
He got off without us
seeing him.

01:51:47.908 --> 01:51:49.143
How'd he do that, Dicky?

01:51:50.311 --> 01:51:53.847
Don't know.
He's a slippery chap.

01:51:55.416 --> 01:51:57.785
See him once a year and I
never know who he is really.

01:51:57.818 --> 01:52:00.287
-Who's Tom?
-The American.

01:52:02.356 --> 01:52:03.857
The American?

01:52:10.898 --> 01:52:13.100
Oh, of course.

01:52:16.503 --> 01:52:18.472
Give us a call
when you get back.

01:52:18.505 --> 01:52:21.242
We always worry until we know
people are home safe.

01:52:21.275 --> 01:52:24.078
And treat yourself
to something nice in Tangier.

01:52:24.111 --> 01:52:26.413
It does wonders, you know,
a little retail therapy.

01:52:26.447 --> 01:52:27.881
Will do that. Bye.

01:52:28.849 --> 01:52:29.917
Bye.

01:52:35.022 --> 01:52:37.124
-Safe journey, David.
-Goodbye, Hamid.

01:52:48.469 --> 01:52:52.106
-What a ghastly weekend.
-That French bitch.

01:52:52.139 --> 01:52:54.576
Amazing people like that
actually exist, isn't it?

01:52:54.609 --> 01:52:57.278
Who was she with? Remind me.

01:52:57.311 --> 01:53:00.147
<i>The New York Times</i> ,
Style section.

01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:01.181
Thank God for that.

01:53:01.215 --> 01:53:03.083
I thought you were going
to say <i>The Guardian.</i>

01:53:03.117 --> 01:53:04.519
I told Hamid
to lock the place up,

01:53:04.552 --> 01:53:06.253
outer gates and everything.

01:53:07.254 --> 01:53:10.824
-Why'd you do that?
-Just to be on the safe side.

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:29.443
-We need to talk.
-No we don't.

01:53:32.346 --> 01:53:35.082
-Excuse me?
-We don't need to talk.

01:53:35.115 --> 01:53:36.450
Nobody needs to talk.

01:53:37.519 --> 01:53:39.587
We can choose to talk
or not talk.

01:53:39.621 --> 01:53:41.989
Which I can assume
you're choosing not to talk.

01:53:42.022 --> 01:53:43.357
Your assumption is correct.

01:53:47.961 --> 01:53:49.564
You don't even want
to talk about your shirt?

01:53:58.138 --> 01:54:01.408
-God, I hate Lou Reed.
-It's Velvet Underground.

01:54:01.442 --> 01:54:03.010
How can you hate Lou Reed?

01:54:07.348 --> 01:54:10.317
- I think we should stop.
- What? Why?

01:54:10.351 --> 01:54:13.220
It's where we hit him, Driss.

01:54:13.253 --> 01:54:15.489
I think we should stop
and pay our respects.

01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:20.494
There's someone in the road.

01:54:32.707 --> 01:54:34.208
No, don't get out of the car.

01:54:43.484 --> 01:54:44.619
David?

01:54:57.464 --> 01:54:58.566
David.

01:55:09.711 --> 01:55:11.011
Abdellah sent you.

01:55:17.084 --> 01:55:18.118
David!

01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:22.089
-It's all right. It's all right.
-It's not-- It's not all right.

01:55:22.122 --> 01:55:23.257
It's a fucking carjacking.

01:55:26.628 --> 01:55:28.095
It's not a carjacking.

01:55:33.066 --> 01:55:34.401
-Don't!
-Do it.

01:55:35.335 --> 01:55:37.337
No, David.

01:55:42.242 --> 01:55:44.546
-Do it.
-David!

01:55:47.114 --> 01:55:48.081
Do it!
