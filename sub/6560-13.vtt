It's Mario.

20:07.082 --> 20:11.669
And so you see, Mario is a descendant
of Doge Malvolio too...

20:11.836 --> 20:13.713
...from another branch of the family.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.174
He knew the legend
of the missing treasure...

...but didn't wanna share it
with the only other descendant, Antonio.

So he concealed his one distinctive
family trait to keep his search a secret.

Green eyes.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.732
That explains the red plastic
we found in the academy.

Right. A red contact lens
over green eyes makes them brown.

was restoring the old painting...

...he discovered the lost portrait
of the doge?

Right. He saw he needed
the four medallions to find the treasure.

20:47.831 --> 20:50.500
So he used the legend
of the Ghostly Gondolier...

were part of the supernatural curse.
