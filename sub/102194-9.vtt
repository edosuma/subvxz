10:09.565 --> 10:11.741
- I know it's hard,
but there's no doubt in my mind

10:11.785 --> 10:13.438
that you're the person
who should be making

10:13.482 --> 10:15.005
this incredibly
important decision

10:15.049 --> 10:16.485
to replace Dr. Kapoor.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.139
- Mm-hmm, and the decision
I'm making

10:18.182 --> 10:20.532
is that you should make it,
okay?

10:20.576 --> 10:21.838
- Uh, Dr. Frome?

10:21.882 --> 10:23.971
- Chance. Hi.

10:24.014 --> 10:26.147
Are you okay? What's going on?
- I--I hate to, uh--

10:26.190 --> 10:29.150
Well, you know that old job I
talked about in group earlier?

10:29.193 --> 10:31.369
- I do, yeah.
Did that not work out?

10:31.413 --> 10:33.545
- No, they're actually
closing down.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.678
- I see.
That's--that's a bummer.

10:35.722 --> 10:36.897
I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.290
But thanks to our class,
I got resourceful.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.336
I already found a new gig.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.120
I just need
a character reference,

10:43.164 --> 10:45.122
so would you mind?

10:45.166 --> 10:47.124
- Would I mind?
Here, give me that thing.

10:47.168 --> 10:48.430
- I truly appreciate it,
Dr. Frome.

10:48.473 --> 10:49.692
- Can I use your back?

10:49.736 --> 10:51.563
- Can I not be in charge
of the search committee?

10:56.525 --> 10:58.222
- Here we go.
Handled.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.529
And, Chance, congratulations.
I'm proud of you.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.226
Where's the--
where's the new gig?

11:02.270 --> 11:03.967
- Oh, you didn't see?
- No.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.187
- It's here.
At New Amsterdam.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.189
First paycheck, lunch is on me.

11:12.846 --> 11:15.152
- Doesn't the American
Psychiatric Association

11:15.196 --> 11:16.850
frown on being friends
with patients?

11:16.893 --> 11:20.418
- Mm-hmm, actively,
but we're not friends, so...

11:20.462 --> 11:21.768
- Does he know that?

11:23.944 --> 11:25.336
- Yeah.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.424
- And, girl,

11:26.468 --> 11:28.731
when they played them slow jams

11:28.775 --> 11:29.993
at the skating rink,

11:30.037 --> 11:31.603
here comes Thom,

11:31.647 --> 11:34.128
holding his hand out
like Billy Dee Williams.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.738
[laughs]

11:35.782 --> 11:37.653
[gruffly]
"You want my arm to fall off?"

11:37.697 --> 11:39.655
[laughter]
- I couldn't help it.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.963
- So when I saw his face pop up
on our school reunion page,

11:43.006 --> 11:44.704
I couldn't help myself neither.

11:44.747 --> 11:46.531
- Miss Juanita just had
to reach out.

11:46.575 --> 11:47.445
- Had to.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.273
I hadn't seen his face since

11:49.317 --> 11:51.362
he joined the army
right after high school.

11:51.406 --> 11:54.583
- Well, her father
had something to do with that.

11:54.626 --> 11:57.151
- I told you,
we ain't going there.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.282
- [chuckles]

11:58.326 --> 11:59.762
- But it's like
we just picked up

11:59.806 --> 12:02.765
where we left off.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.899
- So what's next
for you two lovebirds?

12:05.942 --> 12:07.683
- Gonna make up for lost time.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.945
Hit Route 66.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.860
The Gateway Arch,

12:10.904 --> 12:12.819
the Meramec Caverns,

12:12.862 --> 12:14.385
Petrified Forest.

12:14.429 --> 12:17.040
- He's been promising me
that trip since we been kids.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.521
- I'm gonna fulfill it too.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.001
- Thomas,

12:21.044 --> 12:23.090
uh, the bruising on your arm

12:23.133 --> 12:24.874
and underneath

12:24.918 --> 12:26.963
on your side here.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.183
- I know.

12:29.226 --> 12:32.316
We've just been busy
catching up and whatnot.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.101
- I'd like to run some tests.

12:34.144 --> 12:37.495
- Tests for what, Dr. Sharpe?

12:37.539 --> 12:40.934
- She thinks my cancer is back.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.377
- Lap pad.
- TS kit on the tray.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.337
- Okay, that should do it
for the bleeder.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.296
But if she has any hopes
of walking again,

12:55.339 --> 12:57.820
we'll have
to take the bullet out.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.604
- Nurse, can you call
Dr. Salaita?

12:59.648 --> 13:00.605
- Will do.

13:03.391 --> 13:04.827
- Do you want
to update her family?

13:04.871 --> 13:07.482
- Yeah, but before I do,
will you take a look at this?

13:07.525 --> 13:09.179
- Powder burns?
- Yeah.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.442
And you see
that stippling there?

13:11.486 --> 13:15.185
- Seems inconsistent
for a drive-by.

13:15.229 --> 13:18.493
- This was close range.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.582
I'm gonna call Social Services.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.241
- I can't believe I gotta go
to the hospital for this.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.851
You all got the vaccine.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.548
The rest of us
just do what we can.

13:30.592 --> 13:31.941
- We're gonna take good care
of you.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.638
I promise.
- [sighs]

13:36.076 --> 13:38.774
[siren wailing]

13:38.818 --> 13:40.080
- Whole building's
accounted for.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.603
We're taking 16 back with us,

13:41.646 --> 13:44.084
and housing bought back
46 unused treatments.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.346
- Of snake oil.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.217
It's like we're living
in the Wild West.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.784
- Well, these families
might as well be.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.699
This building's located in
the middle of a Wi-Fi desert.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.396
If you can't access
the Internet,

13:52.440 --> 13:53.702
you can't debunk the snake oil.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.704
And this is just
gonna keep happening.

13:55.747 --> 13:58.838
Fake news, fake cures,
unless...

13:58.881 --> 14:00.187
[sighs]

14:00.230 --> 14:02.276
Unless we do something
about it.

14:02.319 --> 14:03.364
- Something like what?

14:03.407 --> 14:06.323
[jazzy music]

14:06.367 --> 14:07.759
- We're gonna get
free broadband access

14:07.803 --> 14:09.631
for every household
in New York City.

14:13.330 --> 14:13.548
.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.898
- I mean, I've heard
of 4G and 5G but never no G.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.378
Not in New York.
That's crazy!

14:17.421 --> 14:19.467
- And imagine what it's like
for people in rural areas

14:19.510 --> 14:20.947
without broadband.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.818
I mean, no wonder the virus hit
the way that it did.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.298
- Yeah.
What you got in the bag there?

14:24.341 --> 14:27.170
- Oh, this?
This is, uh...

14:27.214 --> 14:29.216
this is my secret weapon
to fight injustice.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.347
- Oh, whoa.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.045
And a secret it shall remain,
I guess.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.569
- Order up, Dr. Frome!

14:34.612 --> 14:35.918
- Chance.
- Yeah.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.659
It's one filthy chai,
just the way you like it.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.008
Five pumps, coconut milk.
- No, no.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.880
I didn't--I didn't order this.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.969
- It's all good.
I got you.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.014
Hey, next in line, please.

14:46.798 --> 14:49.584
- Your résumé and references
are...

14:49.627 --> 14:51.281
impeccable.

14:51.325 --> 14:52.674
I never thought
we'd find someone

14:52.717 --> 14:54.502
to replace Dr. Kapoor, but I--

14:54.545 --> 14:55.938
- Thank you, Dr. Kao.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.767
I've devoted my entire life
to the nervous system.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.160
- I see.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.727
You were head of neurology
at Holy Cross in Houston

15:02.771 --> 15:05.078
for 12 years.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.862
Can I ask what brought you
to New York?

15:06.906 --> 15:09.125
- Simply put, regular
psychosocial stimulation

15:09.169 --> 15:10.953
is good for your brain.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.303
I believe it's essential.

15:13.347 --> 15:14.826
- I so agree!

15:14.870 --> 15:18.613
Our senses deliver information
that's key to survival.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.049
- Exactly.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.964
- So how would you describe
your leadership style?

15:22.008 --> 15:23.270
- I lead by example.
- Uh-huh.

15:23.313 --> 15:24.532
- Management should share
the same sacrifices

15:24.575 --> 15:25.837
as their team does.

15:25.881 --> 15:29.537
And I give each weekday
its own funky theme.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.237
- I'm sorry.
How do you mean?

15:34.281 --> 15:35.935
- Like Moon Tower Mondays,

15:35.978 --> 15:37.980
basically '70s garb.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.287
Tahiti Tuesdays.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.985
Waikiki Wednesdays have
to be reconceived because

15:43.029 --> 15:46.510
employees start recycling
their Tuesday outfits.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.036
You want to guess Thursday?

15:50.079 --> 15:52.386
- No. I'm good.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.519
- How are you feeling, Sydney?

15:55.563 --> 15:56.868
- Tired.

15:56.912 --> 15:59.610
So ridonkulous the Rona-Vaxx
made me this sick.

15:59.654 --> 16:01.134
- Actually, it's not,

16:01.177 --> 16:04.137
because Rona-Vaxx is not
a real treatment for COVID.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.052
- Well, I'm just lucky
that my silver pills

16:06.095 --> 16:08.141
didn't kick my butt like this.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.751
- You're taking silver pills
as well?

16:09.794 --> 16:12.101
- Yeah, only 'cause my dude
with the hydroxychloroquine

16:12.145 --> 16:14.016
bailed upstate.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.670
- Hydroxychloroquine.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.760
So you're taking all three of
these things at the same time?

16:18.803 --> 16:22.242
- And obvs it's working 'cause
I'm, like, COVID-free, right?

16:22.285 --> 16:24.244
- [sighs]

16:24.287 --> 16:26.942
[inhales deeply]
Okay.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.205
- [whistling]

16:29.249 --> 16:31.207
Evan Nashton,
board member extraordinaire.

16:31.251 --> 16:32.904
You here for the big meeting?
- Oh, God.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.863
Not the suit.
- What? This old thing?

16:34.906 --> 16:37.039
- You only wear a suit when
you're trying to shake us down.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.041
- Shakedown?
Evan, I'm offended.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.564
I mean, can't
the medical director

16:40.608 --> 16:42.088
of New York's
largest public hospital

16:42.131 --> 16:43.567
just have a friendly chat
with the CFO

16:43.611 --> 16:45.178
of New York's
largest telecom company?

16:45.221 --> 16:46.744
Just two old buddies gabbing,
huh?

16:46.788 --> 16:48.529
- Save it.
You have some idea.

16:48.572 --> 16:51.097
I'm sure it's inspiring
and financially ruinous.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.316
- Do you know how many
households in New York City

16:53.360 --> 16:54.926
don't have broadband?
- 500,000.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.972
- 5--oh.
That's exactly right.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.714
Now, wouldn't it be cool if you

16:59.757 --> 17:01.803
hooked them up?

17:01.846 --> 17:03.152
- "Hooked them up"?
- Yeah.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.763
Free Internet for everybody.

17:05.807 --> 17:08.288
- Take the thing that
my company sells for money--

17:08.331 --> 17:10.203
- Give it away for free.
Right.

17:10.246 --> 17:11.378
- [scoffs]
You know, when people

17:11.421 --> 17:12.944
can't afford
their power bill,

17:12.988 --> 17:15.121
Con Ed doesn't show up
with a new AC.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.949
Broadband is the same,
a utility to be paid for.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.082
- Right, and if broadband
is a utility,

17:20.126 --> 17:23.259
then it's like power
or clean water.

17:23.303 --> 17:26.088
And shouldn't everyone
have access to that?

17:26.132 --> 17:27.872
Think about it.
Telemedicine.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.091
Prescription refills.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.006
Our patients will be healthier!

17:31.050 --> 17:33.182
- Look, I applaud
your idealism--

17:33.226 --> 17:34.575
- No, no, I applaud yours,

17:34.618 --> 17:36.446
like when you donated
free Internet

17:36.490 --> 17:38.666
to impoverished areas
in sub-Saharan Africa.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.755
You helped people in a desert

17:40.798 --> 17:43.801
5,500 miles away.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.238
Now, surely, Evan,

17:45.281 --> 17:47.457
I think you can do
a little something

17:47.501 --> 17:50.112
for the broadband desert
right here

17:50.156 --> 17:53.246
in your own backyard.

17:53.289 --> 17:55.030
- I'll give you ten apartments.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.553
- 17 housing projects.
- [sighs]

17:56.597 --> 17:59.121
One building, and you
don't speak to me for a year.

17:59.165 --> 18:00.253
- Done.
It's always a pleasure

18:00.296 --> 18:01.645
to casually bump into you,
Evan.

18:06.824 --> 18:10.480
- Thomas, three years ago,
your leukemia was in remission.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.876
But now your cancer
has mutated

18:14.919 --> 18:18.097
into a new, aggressive form

18:18.140 --> 18:21.448
that won't respond
to any of our treatments.

18:21.491 --> 18:23.145
- And...

18:23.189 --> 18:25.930
if we tried another protocol?

18:25.974 --> 18:27.541
- I'm afraid there aren't any.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.808
- How much time does he have?

18:33.851 --> 18:37.681
- I may be able to get him
a couple of extra months.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.640
Good ones.
Good ones.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.990
You'll need to come
to the hospital every few days

18:42.033 --> 18:43.731
for blood transfusions
to stave off--

18:43.774 --> 18:46.821
- I can start all that
when we get back from our trip.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.388
- No, no.

18:48.431 --> 18:51.608
Thomas, in order to get
those extra couple of months,

18:51.652 --> 18:54.437
we need to start
the transfusions immediately.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.047
That means staying here
in New York.

18:56.091 --> 18:58.049
No Route 66.

18:59.399 --> 19:02.184
