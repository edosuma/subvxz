00:09.100 --> 00:12.684
Oh, Chelsea,
you are in for a rare treat tonight.

00:12.855 --> 00:17.400
Your first opera, and Ben Heppner
is singing the role of Tristan.

00:17.570 --> 00:20.441
Oh, this is gonna be
a whole new experience for me.

00:20.615 --> 00:23.701
Why?
You've never been bored before?

00:24.787 --> 00:26.033
[ENGINE STOPS]

00:26.206 --> 00:30.371
Oh, dear.
Car seems to have stalled.

00:30.545 --> 00:33.001
Oh, great. Now what?

00:33.173 --> 00:34.966
All right, let's not panic.

00:35.135 --> 00:38.089
Chelsea, if you would, please,
open the glove compartment.

00:38.264 --> 00:40.838
You will find a flashlight
and a small tool kit.

00:41.018 --> 00:42.049
Ah.

00:42.269 --> 00:45.106
Reach behind them
and hand me my cell phone.

00:46.608 --> 00:47.854
l'm gonna call the Auto Club.

00:48.027 --> 00:50.150
By the time they get here,
we'll miss the opera.

00:50.321 --> 00:52.445
You know, my ex-boyfriend
used to restore Corvettes.

00:52.616 --> 00:54.775
Maybe l can poke around
and take a look.

00:54.952 --> 00:57.908
l suppose l could give you a hand.
You don't grow up with eight brothers

00:58.082 --> 01:00.205
and not learn a thing or two
about engines.

01:00.376 --> 01:03.164
Or the importance
of being first in the shower.

01:03.338 --> 01:07.124
Now, now, ladies. Niles and l
are no strangers to the automobile.

01:07.302 --> 01:09.877
Niles, let's have a look.
l'll pop the hood.

01:10.056 --> 01:12.512
That won't void the warranty, will it?

01:13.352 --> 01:16.603
Ha-ha-ha. That's very funny, Niles.

01:16.773 --> 01:20.190
No cause for alarm, ladies.
Here we go.
