WEBVTT

01:01.208 --> 01:03.250
<i>Every journey has a beginning.</i>

01:13.250 --> 01:14.916
<i>But yours has no end.</i>

01:18.541 --> 01:20.333
<i>It goes on forever and ever.</i>

01:26.291 --> 01:30.125
I'm here to finally make your journey
come to an end.

01:35.625 --> 01:37.125
This is impossible.

01:40.791 --> 01:42.291
You're dead.

01:44.625 --> 01:46.416
I had you killed.

01:47.166 --> 01:50.541
You still have no idea
how this game is played.

01:51.833 --> 01:54.333
You want to destroy the knot,

01:55.291 --> 01:58.708
but every step you take keeps it intact.

02:00.125 --> 02:01.625
This can't be.

02:07.166 --> 02:08.791
I killed it.

02:11.041 --> 02:14.208
I killed Martha
and I killed the origin.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.291
Your world and Eva's world.

02:23.625 --> 02:26.083
They both should never have existed.

02:30.958 --> 02:32.583
You thought the origin

02:32.666 --> 02:35.041
lies in the connection
between both worlds.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.916
But in reality it lies
outside both of those worlds.

02:43.500 --> 02:46.166
Our thinking is shaped by dualities.

02:48.166 --> 02:49.791
Black, white.

02:50.583 --> 02:52.166
Light and shadow.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.291
Your world and Eva's world.

02:57.541 --> 02:59.125
But that's wrong.

03:01.333 --> 03:04.000
Nothing is complete
without a third dimension.

03:09.041 --> 03:10.541
The triquetra.

03:21.333 --> 03:22.625
There is...

03:25.083 --> 03:26.666
a third world?

03:30.666 --> 03:33.500
<i>The world that gave birth to the knot.</i>

03:34.416 --> 03:36.500
<i>Where everything originates.</i>

03:38.916 --> 03:41.291
<i>Where a single mistake was made.</i>

03:47.791 --> 03:50.750
<i>Tannhaus... in the origin world...</i>

03:51.625 --> 03:53.916
<i>like you, he lost someone.</i>

03:56.333 --> 03:59.916
<i>And like you, he tried</i>
<i>to bring someone back from the dead.</i>

04:09.041 --> 04:11.791
<i>But instead</i>
<i>he split and destroyed his world.</i>

04:13.791 --> 04:16.666
<i>Thus creating both our worlds.</i>

04:40.791 --> 04:43.833
But there's a way to destroy the knot.

04:45.666 --> 04:48.708
By preventing the invention of travel
through space and time

04:49.375 --> 04:52.791
in the origin world in the first place.

06:26.666 --> 06:31.000
PARADISE

07:04.416 --> 07:07.166
I'd have liked to have spared you
all of that.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.333
But your path had to remain unchanged.

07:13.375 --> 07:16.833
Every step had to be taken
exactly as before.

07:18.833 --> 07:20.583
Up until this moment.

07:28.875 --> 07:30.000
This...

07:32.625 --> 07:34.500
Has it happened before?

07:35.708 --> 07:38.375
You trying to destroy the origin,

07:38.458 --> 07:40.708
that has happened
an infinite number of times.

07:42.666 --> 07:44.333
But this here,

07:44.416 --> 07:46.083
you and I,

07:46.166 --> 07:47.833
is happening for the first time.

07:52.208 --> 07:56.125
It's time you understand
how everything is really connected.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.250
<i>Everything you have done,</i>

08:01.000 --> 08:03.125
<i>everything Eva has done,</i>

08:04.375 --> 08:09.000
<i>has upheld the knot for eternity,</i>
<i>in both worlds.</i>

08:10.375 --> 08:12.916
<i>You create yourself forever anew.</i>

08:14.083 --> 08:15.750
<i>And so does she.</i>

08:22.166 --> 08:23.666
They have to die.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.208
They must all die,

08:27.291 --> 08:29.458
so that they can be reborn.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.125
You carry both worlds inside you.

08:39.208 --> 08:40.333
What?

08:41.041 --> 08:42.291
Your son.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.333
He's the origin.

08:45.291 --> 08:50.083
He gives everyone their lives
alternately in each of the two worlds.

09:07.958 --> 09:09.875
He's waited a long time for you.

09:12.166 --> 09:13.625
And he'll do so time and time again.

09:26.875 --> 09:29.708
<i>You want to destroy your son,</i>

09:30.250 --> 09:32.291
<i>and the knot along with him.</i>

09:32.375 --> 09:34.416
<i>Eva wants him to live,</i>

09:35.000 --> 09:38.250
<i>and must therefore uphold the knot.</i>

09:40.083 --> 09:42.458
<i>She can't help it.</i>

09:42.541 --> 09:45.875
<i>Time and again she'll do all she can do</i>
<i>to ensure he lives.</i>

09:49.000 --> 09:53.125
<i>Everything you and Eva have done</i>
<i>in this knot,</i>

09:53.208 --> 09:55.083
<i>and will do over and over again,</i>

09:55.708 --> 09:57.416
<i>you did out of love.</i>

10:03.458 --> 10:06.958
<i>And yet you have brought nothing</i>
<i>but pain and suffering.</i>

10:22.166 --> 10:24.291
If you want Jonas to live,

10:24.875 --> 10:26.958
if you want all of them to live,

10:28.208 --> 10:31.125
then we must do what has always been done.

10:34.833 --> 10:36.041
You too.

10:46.791 --> 10:50.750
<i>Both of you have done</i>
<i>unimaginable things on your journey.</i>

10:53.208 --> 10:57.250
<i>Because you can't let go</i>
<i>of your deepest desires.</i>

11:05.791 --> 11:08.708
Yours ends here and now.

11:09.250 --> 11:10.541
What's that mean?

11:10.625 --> 11:15.083
You have accomplished
what you were sent to this world for.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.625
We've accomplished nothing.

11:18.166 --> 11:20.625
She said we had to stop the apocalypse.

11:20.708 --> 11:23.208
-The barrels in the power plant--
-You'll understand it all

11:23.916 --> 11:25.916
when it's time for you to understand.

11:33.416 --> 11:36.458
<i>You have been trying to escape</i>
<i>what you'll become.</i>

11:38.916 --> 11:40.666
<i>But that's impossible.</i>

11:42.875 --> 11:46.291
<i>In the end, you will always stand</i>
<i>face to face with yourselves.</i>

11:59.958 --> 12:01.458
Who are you?

12:02.875 --> 12:04.750
I'm sorry.

12:07.250 --> 12:10.916
Your two worlds should have never existed.

12:11.666 --> 12:13.791
You and Eva,

12:13.875 --> 12:17.000
the two of you should have never existed.

12:19.958 --> 12:21.833
How do you know all this?

12:22.166 --> 12:24.625
How do you know about the origin world?

12:26.958 --> 12:31.541
I've spent 33 years looking for answers
in your world and in hers.

12:32.375 --> 12:35.458
<i>I've tried to put together</i>
<i>the pieces of the puzzle.</i>

12:36.125 --> 12:40.125
<i>To understand how everything can be reborn</i>
<i>from the same family tree</i>

12:40.208 --> 12:42.583
<i>over and over again.</i>

12:44.416 --> 12:48.750
<i>Until I realized</i>
<i>that we're not all part of the knot.</i>

12:49.958 --> 12:51.708
<i>Both worlds are a cancer</i>

12:51.791 --> 12:54.125
<i>that must have grown from something else.</i>

12:55.875 --> 13:00.208
<i>If you remove it,</i>
<i>you destroy all that was born of it,</i>

13:00.291 --> 13:02.250
<i>but you keep everything alive</i>

13:02.333 --> 13:05.583
<i>that already existed in the origin world.</i>

13:06.458 --> 13:08.541
All these years, I thought

13:09.208 --> 13:11.166
that she was my daughter.

13:13.375 --> 13:16.166
For a long time,
I wished you were the father.

13:24.708 --> 13:26.208
But it's better this way.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.916
She isn't part of the knot.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.916
She will live.

13:34.875 --> 13:36.833
<i>But just like you and Eva,</i>

13:37.416 --> 13:40.125
<i>I had to preserve everything</i>

13:40.208 --> 13:42.541
<i>in order to become what I am today.</i>

13:45.750 --> 13:47.625
You know what you have to do.

13:49.583 --> 13:50.833
Do it quickly.

13:51.541 --> 13:52.791
Don't let her suffer.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.291
It's no life that's she's living.

13:57.916 --> 13:59.416
It has to happen,

14:00.541 --> 14:03.875
so I can move heaven and earth
to prevent it.

14:17.291 --> 14:20.916
<i>Just like you,</i>
<i>I've brought pain and suffering to others,</i>

14:21.000 --> 14:22.666
<i>again and again...</i>

14:23.250 --> 14:26.583
<i>so that my path</i>
<i>could lead me here to you today.</i>

14:38.541 --> 14:40.166
<i>Everything I did</i>

14:41.625 --> 14:43.583
<i>I did for Regina.</i>

14:46.041 --> 14:50.916
<i>All these years, I've been searching</i>
<i>in both worlds for a way for her to live.</i>

14:53.458 --> 14:57.916
<i>A way to break the chain</i>
<i>of cause and effect.</i>

15:19.375 --> 15:20.583
<i>Both in your world</i>

15:21.750 --> 15:23.541
<i>and in Eva's world,</i>

15:24.500 --> 15:27.416
<i>I've tried to understand</i>
<i>how everything is connected.</i>

15:28.833 --> 15:30.666
<i>Really connected.</i>

15:31.750 --> 15:36.791
<i>Until I finally understood</i>
<i>that our two worlds were borne of another.</i>

15:37.875 --> 15:41.041
<i>That Regina will always die</i>
<i>in both worlds.</i>

15:42.625 --> 15:46.041
<i>That she can only live in the world</i>
<i>from which everything was created;</i>

15:47.375 --> 15:49.000
<i>the origin world.</i>

15:50.625 --> 15:52.250
<i>I lied to you...</i>

15:53.875 --> 15:55.125
<i>and to Eva.</i>

15:57.041 --> 15:59.875
<i>But the knot had to be upheld.</i>

16:01.000 --> 16:04.333
<i>I had to ensure</i>
<i>that you both stayed in the dark.</i>

16:05.000 --> 16:07.875
<i>That everyone in this knot</i>
<i>stayed in the dark.</i>

16:10.125 --> 16:13.666
<i>First, everything had to happen</i>
<i>the way it always has...</i>

16:14.416 --> 16:17.333
<i>in your world and in her world.</i>

16:29.708 --> 16:31.625
<i>Every step in this labyrinth</i>

16:32.958 --> 16:35.583
<i>had to be taken as it had been before.</i>

16:42.583 --> 16:46.166
<i>An infinite chain of cause and effect</i>

16:46.708 --> 16:48.958
<i>that leads us all, in both worlds,</i>

16:50.000 --> 16:52.208
<i>to our same fate over and over again.</i>

16:57.083 --> 16:58.458
Excuse me.

16:59.708 --> 17:02.291
Did someone just pass by here?

17:02.791 --> 17:04.208
An old man?

17:05.875 --> 17:08.583
<i>We have no free will to act</i>
<i>in either world.</i>

17:09.708 --> 17:12.500
<i>We will forever do</i>
<i>what we have always done before.</i>

17:14.666 --> 17:15.666
Hey.

17:25.625 --> 17:27.250
You're Helge Doppler, aren't you?

17:28.791 --> 17:30.041
Helge.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.791
<i>No fate in one world</i>

17:33.833 --> 17:35.416
<i>is better than the other.</i>

17:35.500 --> 17:37.000
What's today's date?

17:39.083 --> 17:40.541
November 8.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.041
Which year?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.958
1986.

17:49.958 --> 17:51.541
1986...

17:57.791 --> 18:00.166
<i>I can change it, you know?</i>

18:00.833 --> 18:02.416
I can change the past.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.250
And the future.

18:05.291 --> 18:07.125
Help!

18:07.208 --> 18:09.166
If you don't exist,
none of this will happen.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.083
No!

18:15.583 --> 18:18.375
What's in there? Is he in there?

18:27.916 --> 18:29.875
-What did you do to him?
-Let go!

18:55.250 --> 18:57.333
<i>As long as the knot exists,</i>

18:57.916 --> 19:00.625
<i>in both worlds we are damned</i>

19:00.708 --> 19:04.250
<i>to feel and cause</i>
<i>every bit of suffering anew.</i>

19:08.500 --> 19:11.333
<i>There is no difference</i>
<i>between the two worlds.</i>

19:12.416 --> 19:15.750
<i>Things may not happen in the same way,</i>

19:16.500 --> 19:17.916
<i>or at the same time.</i>

19:18.666 --> 19:20.041
<i>But they do happen.</i>

19:29.125 --> 19:30.708
<i>No one in this knot</i>

19:31.083 --> 19:32.958
<i>can escape their fate.</i>

19:36.416 --> 19:38.000
It was you.

19:56.833 --> 19:58.375
<i>Every piece of the puzzle</i>

19:58.458 --> 20:00.791
<i>repeatedly finds its place.</i>

20:06.583 --> 20:09.708
<i>Just like you, I moved the pieces</i>
<i>around the chessboard,</i>

20:10.250 --> 20:13.875
<i>and had to look on as everything happened</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

20:25.666 --> 20:29.166
<i>But I finally know how to untie the knot.</i>

20:32.541 --> 20:35.791
I know where the loophole is
that you've searched for all this time.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.416
Time.

20:40.458 --> 20:44.875
During the apocalypse,
it stood still for a fraction of a second.

20:45.416 --> 20:48.083
And that threw everything out of balance.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.833
But when time stands still,

20:51.416 --> 20:55.250
the chain of cause and effect
is also momentarily broken.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.208
One can...

21:00.708 --> 21:02.750
change things.

21:04.833 --> 21:06.458
Eva knows that.

21:07.458 --> 21:09.208
She uses the loophole in your world

21:09.291 --> 21:12.666
to send her younger self off
in one direction or another,

21:13.708 --> 21:16.000
in order to preserve the cycle.

21:17.041 --> 21:21.583
And I used it to send myself
in another direction, too.

21:21.666 --> 21:23.083
To be here today.

21:24.125 --> 21:28.708
You must use it
to send Jonas on a different path...

21:30.041 --> 21:32.541
in order to break the cycle
once and for all.

21:33.583 --> 21:38.333
Jonas and Martha are to blame
for everything happening again and again.

21:38.875 --> 21:44.083
You must send them to the origin world,
so they can finally end all this.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.083
I promise you.

22:18.416 --> 22:20.000
I'll make this right.

22:35.333 --> 22:36.750
Why are you still here?

22:38.750 --> 22:40.041
She's dead!

22:44.333 --> 22:46.125
What more do you want from me?

22:46.875 --> 22:48.958
I can explain it. Everything.

22:49.958 --> 22:51.833
But first we have to get out of here.

22:54.875 --> 22:56.291
What's going on?

22:59.041 --> 23:00.333
What is that?

23:04.208 --> 23:05.500
What is that?

23:06.125 --> 23:08.166
That is our last hope.

23:25.666 --> 23:27.458
How did you do that?

23:27.541 --> 23:29.083
What time is this?

23:31.416 --> 23:33.416
The question isn't "what time?"

23:36.666 --> 23:38.333
But "which world?"

23:46.666 --> 23:48.166
What's that supposed to mean?

23:50.041 --> 23:51.250
There is a way

23:52.958 --> 23:55.208
that you can avoid becoming me,

23:55.833 --> 23:59.041
a way all of this never needs to happen.

23:59.958 --> 24:02.875
But for it to work, you have to trust me.

24:33.833 --> 24:35.791
You don't have much time left.

24:36.583 --> 24:38.166
The other Martha,

24:38.833 --> 24:40.500
you must save her.

24:43.291 --> 24:45.208
The other Martha?

24:46.083 --> 24:48.166
All these years I thought

24:49.958 --> 24:52.583
that I alone have to change it.

24:53.791 --> 24:55.875
But it is just as much her fault.

24:58.166 --> 25:00.208
You are two parts of a whole.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.333
Only together can you return
to the origin world.

25:05.708 --> 25:07.583
What we know is a drop.

25:08.791 --> 25:10.333
What we don't know...

25:12.000 --> 25:13.416
is an ocean.

25:16.666 --> 25:18.125
What does that mean?

25:26.458 --> 25:28.458
Tick, tock.

25:29.541 --> 25:31.083
Tick, tock.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.500
Tick, tock.

25:40.375 --> 25:42.791
Today is the day of the apocalypse...

25:43.041 --> 25:44.000
in her world.

25:48.041 --> 25:49.583
The loophole...

25:50.375 --> 25:52.250
it also exists here.

25:53.875 --> 25:57.458
For one moment, time will stand still.

26:01.708 --> 26:03.833
You must get Martha...

26:05.333 --> 26:07.791
before Magnus and Franziska get her.

26:11.083 --> 26:13.375
And before everything happens again.

26:21.041 --> 26:24.250
The two of you are our last hope.

26:28.041 --> 26:30.750
Adam will send Jonas on his way.

26:32.708 --> 26:37.916
He and Martha, they will stop
all this from ever happening.

26:54.583 --> 26:55.666
Dad.

26:59.583 --> 27:01.458
Tell him I'm sorry.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.291
If everything goes right...

27:25.416 --> 27:27.166
then Regina will live.

28:56.250 --> 28:57.583
Martha?

28:57.666 --> 28:59.625
What's going on?

29:03.083 --> 29:04.291
Martha?

29:08.291 --> 29:09.458
You have to come with us.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.708
Come where?

29:42.500 --> 29:44.000
This can't be.

29:57.208 --> 29:58.708
You're alive.

30:08.208 --> 30:09.958
You look like her.

30:29.583 --> 30:31.458
You don't know who I am.

30:43.541 --> 30:45.208
What time are we in?

30:53.500 --> 30:54.916
When are we?

30:56.125 --> 30:57.833
Why are we here?

31:04.375 --> 31:07.000
Today is June 21, 1986.

31:07.375 --> 31:09.916
The day our two worlds were created.

31:10.666 --> 31:12.833
Not here, but in his world.

31:14.916 --> 31:19.208
Tannhaus, the clockmaker, will open
the passage for the first time today.

31:19.708 --> 31:20.833
What?

31:25.291 --> 31:26.833
We don't have much time.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.250
We have to stop it from ever happening.

31:30.833 --> 31:31.666
Wait!

31:33.208 --> 31:34.791
What does that mean?

33:17.875 --> 33:19.250
Where are we going?

33:21.083 --> 33:23.333
We're bringing someone back from the dead.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.875
What's that supposed to mean?

33:27.958 --> 33:30.125
It's a bit complicated to explain.

33:31.291 --> 33:33.541
We have to get them before they die.

33:39.666 --> 33:41.041
What are you trying to do?

33:53.041 --> 33:54.458
You and I.

33:56.708 --> 33:59.541
We're the reason
everything happens the way it does.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.958
Why it happens again and again.

34:06.708 --> 34:09.125
Because you can't let go of what you want.

34:11.666 --> 34:13.833
And I can't let go of what I want.

34:15.791 --> 34:17.541
But we are the mistake.

34:21.375 --> 34:23.166
The glitch in the matrix.

34:31.291 --> 34:33.250
You want them to never exist.

34:36.750 --> 34:38.541
Your world and mine.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.625
That we never exist.

35:56.708 --> 35:58.583
I was expecting you.

36:04.333 --> 36:06.166
I know why you're here.

36:24.958 --> 36:26.458
But in the end...

36:27.916 --> 36:29.375
every death

36:30.000 --> 36:31.708
is just a new beginning.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.000
You can't win.

36:48.083 --> 36:49.416
My dying

36:49.500 --> 36:52.166
is only another step in the cycle.

36:53.375 --> 36:55.083
You're going to kill me today.

36:56.750 --> 36:58.416
Martha will find me.

37:00.375 --> 37:02.958
Just as I once found myself.

37:05.625 --> 37:08.041
It will turn her against you
once and for all.

37:11.083 --> 37:12.666
What are you waiting for?

37:42.083 --> 37:43.708
This isn't right.

37:45.541 --> 37:47.666
It didn't happen like this.

37:49.625 --> 37:50.666
It...

37:50.750 --> 37:52.833
it never happened this way.

37:55.208 --> 37:57.541
You killed me.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.041
Every time.

38:01.666 --> 38:03.416
You will die.

38:06.375 --> 38:08.375
I will die.

38:09.625 --> 38:11.958
And everything that has grown out of us.

38:15.208 --> 38:16.791
What have you done?

38:28.875 --> 38:30.833
Life is a labyrinth.

38:31.458 --> 38:34.750
Some wander around inside it
until their death,

38:34.833 --> 38:36.833
in search of a way out.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.458
<i>But there is only one path,</i>

38:44.333 --> 38:46.750
<i>and it leads ever deeper inside.</i>

38:48.708 --> 38:51.958
<i>Only when one reaches the center</i>

38:52.875 --> 38:54.375
<i>will one understand.</i>

38:57.958 --> 39:01.125
Death is incomprehensible.

39:03.750 --> 39:06.625
But one can reconcile oneself with it.

39:10.333 --> 39:12.375
All that we have done

39:14.708 --> 39:16.625
will ultimately be forgotten.

39:22.916 --> 39:28.291
<i>We are responsible</i>
<i>for this never-ending déjà vu.</i>

39:32.041 --> 39:34.625
<i>And we're the ones</i>

39:34.708 --> 39:36.333
<i>who have to end it.</i>

39:41.291 --> 39:42.500
We...

39:43.416 --> 39:45.125
are the mistake.

39:47.791 --> 39:49.416
You and I.

40:04.875 --> 40:09.625
<i>Both our fates are bound together</i>
<i>in eternal damnation.</i>

40:10.833 --> 40:12.541
<i>Across both worlds.</i>

40:14.125 --> 40:16.750
<i>Everything is cause and effect.</i>

40:18.000 --> 40:21.375
<i>Every pain entices us to act,</i>

40:21.958 --> 40:23.833
<i>shapes our will.</i>

40:25.041 --> 40:30.625
<i>Tannhaus lost all that ever meant</i>
<i>anything to him in the origin world.</i>

40:32.000 --> 40:37.541
<i>His son, daughter-in-law,</i>
<i>and granddaughter died in a car accident.</i>

40:38.250 --> 40:43.166
<i>They were forced off a bridge,</i>
<i>and drowned in the river.</i>

40:45.083 --> 40:47.583
<i>He never forgot that pain.</i>

40:52.541 --> 40:54.125
<i>Jonas and Martha,</i>

40:55.041 --> 40:57.625
<i>they have to take his pain away from him,</i>

40:59.166 --> 41:03.708
<i>so that he never looks</i>
<i>for a way to undo everything.</i>

41:07.541 --> 41:10.833
<i>They must go to the origin world</i>

41:12.208 --> 41:14.375
<i>and prevent our two worlds</i>

41:15.166 --> 41:18.666
<i>from ever being created.</i>

41:36.125 --> 41:39.750
This is the moment
the passage was first opened.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.166
Tannhaus tried to travel back to a world
in which his family was still alive.

41:57.083 --> 41:59.541
But instead, he split his own world.

42:01.750 --> 42:03.416
He created the knot.

42:06.541 --> 42:08.041
Created us.

42:14.375 --> 42:16.083
For a brief moment,

42:16.791 --> 42:18.541
there will be a bridge...

42:21.625 --> 42:23.375
between all three worlds.

42:28.208 --> 42:30.000
You want to go to his world?

42:32.750 --> 42:36.666
We have to travel back to the moment
when his pain began.

42:52.291 --> 42:53.666
Jonas...

42:55.833 --> 42:57.458
the one in your world...

43:01.041 --> 43:02.416
was he different?

43:52.708 --> 43:53.875
It's starting.

45:09.250 --> 45:10.375
Martha?

45:29.333 --> 45:30.833
Martha?

45:48.875 --> 45:50.041
Jonas?

46:01.625 --> 46:03.041
Jonas!

46:12.416 --> 46:13.625
Martha?

46:25.458 --> 46:26.458
Jonas!

47:03.333 --> 47:04.583
Martha?

47:05.250 --> 47:06.750
Oh, there you are.

47:10.041 --> 47:12.041
He looks sad.

47:13.125 --> 47:14.625
Who looks sad?

47:14.708 --> 47:16.666
The boy standing there.

47:18.083 --> 47:20.041
But there's no one there.

47:20.125 --> 47:22.041
It's only the back of your closet.

47:38.125 --> 47:39.250
Jonas?

47:40.625 --> 47:42.125
Is everything okay?

47:44.250 --> 47:46.166
What do you want in the basement?

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
What is it?

47:53.125 --> 47:55.041
There's a girl standing there.

47:56.708 --> 47:58.583
There's no girl there.

48:04.916 --> 48:06.916
Come on.
Let's go back to the others, okay?

48:20.958 --> 48:22.375
Come on.

50:18.583 --> 50:22.416
Do you always have to bring that up?
Can't you let it be for once?

50:24.791 --> 50:27.250
I thought you wanted the store.

50:28.833 --> 50:31.916
-Maybe not now, but sometime later.
-You never listen!

50:32.666 --> 50:34.916
No wonder Mom couldn't take it anymore.

50:35.541 --> 50:38.333
Your endless lecturing,
Big Bang, Big Crunch...

50:38.416 --> 50:40.833
Have you ever asked Sonja
if she's interested?

50:42.291 --> 50:45.291
In all these years,
have you ever asked if I'm interested?

50:45.375 --> 50:47.125
Or what I really want?

50:52.583 --> 50:54.083
It's raining outside.

50:59.333 --> 51:01.375
Is that all you have to say?

51:06.916 --> 51:08.000
Marek, come on.

51:08.083 --> 51:10.708
You told me
the world outside was full of secrets,

51:10.791 --> 51:13.958
and what we know
is a drop in an infinite ocean.

51:14.708 --> 51:16.625
At least you were right about that.

51:16.708 --> 51:19.833
You may know everything about
Einstein-Rosen bridges and black holes,

51:19.916 --> 51:24.041
but about me...
You know absolutely nothing about me.

51:38.958 --> 51:41.416
I... I thought you'd stay a few more days.

51:43.208 --> 51:44.500
He'll cool off.

52:10.833 --> 52:12.583
Was that really necessary?

52:13.916 --> 52:16.250
We could just as well have left tomorrow.

52:19.375 --> 52:20.916
You're ashamed of him.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.666
You have no idea what he's like.

52:24.750 --> 52:28.333
Growing up that way.
He lives in his head, in his big ideas.

52:28.416 --> 52:30.750
Have you ever seen what he does?

52:30.833 --> 52:33.708
I don't get why anyone watches that stuff.

52:33.791 --> 52:35.125
He only ever looked up.

52:35.208 --> 52:38.125
Stars, galaxies, stupid universes,
but me...

52:39.000 --> 52:40.500
He never saw me.

52:48.041 --> 52:49.916
You can't choose your family.

52:54.458 --> 52:55.541
Yeah.

52:57.916 --> 52:59.416
I chose you.

53:01.666 --> 53:02.833
Yes.

53:04.416 --> 53:06.166
You chose me.

53:13.625 --> 53:14.958
Look out!

53:23.708 --> 53:25.125
Are you okay?

53:25.208 --> 53:26.458
Yeah?

53:30.791 --> 53:33.750
-What are they doing there?
-I'll go and see.

53:35.708 --> 53:37.500
What the hell is this?

53:38.083 --> 53:41.291
You can't just stand around here!
I almost ran you over!

53:54.750 --> 53:56.166
Is everything okay?

54:01.083 --> 54:02.416
Do you need help?

54:05.500 --> 54:07.208
The bridge is closed.

54:09.541 --> 54:10.708
What?

54:11.833 --> 54:13.416
There was an accident.

54:13.875 --> 54:15.500
Do you think this is funny?

54:17.833 --> 54:19.333
Go on, go home.

54:20.583 --> 54:22.375
What we know is a drop.

54:23.958 --> 54:26.000
What we don't know is an ocean.

54:29.041 --> 54:30.500
Your father loves you.

54:33.208 --> 54:34.916
He would do anything for you.

54:44.375 --> 54:46.000
What did you just say?

54:46.916 --> 54:48.125
Marek?

54:49.291 --> 54:50.791
Is everything okay?

55:05.208 --> 55:06.708
The bridge is closed.

55:11.583 --> 55:13.500
Come on. Let's go.

55:14.333 --> 55:15.416
Marek!

55:28.791 --> 55:30.375
What was that?

55:35.666 --> 55:37.166
You were right.

55:39.083 --> 55:40.750
We should leave tomorrow.

56:22.291 --> 56:24.000
You're back?

56:24.083 --> 56:25.750
The bridge is closed.

56:27.375 --> 56:31.208
-Your son thinks he met a pair of angels.
-Don't mock me.

56:36.833 --> 56:38.458
I don't know why...

56:41.083 --> 56:42.791
but I suddenly just got this...

56:44.041 --> 56:45.458
this feeling.

57:10.333 --> 57:12.208
It's nice that you're back.

57:17.416 --> 57:19.583
I haven't even stripped the beds yet.

57:22.958 --> 57:25.291
I'll take the bags upstairs.

57:35.875 --> 57:37.125
Thanks.

57:43.375 --> 57:44.458
Want to hold her?

57:48.291 --> 57:50.166
Charlotte already missed you too.

57:53.541 --> 57:55.000
I'll help Marek.

58:36.583 --> 58:38.333
Do you think it worked?

59:06.625 --> 59:08.000
Inside the light...

59:11.833 --> 59:13.125
I saw you.

59:16.333 --> 59:17.583
As a child.

59:23.958 --> 59:25.666
You were looking towards me...

59:29.875 --> 59:31.916
as if you could see me too.

59:37.458 --> 59:38.833
In the closet?

59:45.166 --> 59:46.583
That was you?

59:51.916 --> 59:53.541
It wasn't a dream.

1:00:13.416 --> 1:00:15.833
Do you think anything of us will remain?

1:00:20.083 --> 1:00:21.875
Or is that what we are?

1:00:24.875 --> 1:00:26.125
A dream?

1:00:29.416 --> 1:00:31.333
And we never really existed?

1:00:36.250 --> 1:00:37.750
I don't know.

1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:16.375
We're a perfect match.

1:01:23.416 --> 1:01:25.208
Never believe anything else.

1:04:02.166 --> 1:04:05.250
-Shall we reheat the lasagna?
-Yes.

1:04:05.333 --> 1:04:07.833
-Let me help you.
-I'll open another bottle, okay?

1:04:07.916 --> 1:04:09.541
-Definitely.
-Yes.

1:04:09.625 --> 1:04:10.958
Can I get a sip too?

1:04:11.041 --> 1:04:13.583
-And now we'll toast to Regina.
-Yes.

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:17.958
-Here's to you.
-Here's to you.

1:04:19.250 --> 1:04:20.666
And thanks for the invite.

1:04:21.750 --> 1:04:23.000
-You're welcome.
-To you.

1:04:33.750 --> 1:04:35.000
Your eye.

1:04:35.583 --> 1:04:39.791
-It looks much better.
-You never actually told us what happened.

1:04:40.458 --> 1:04:43.541
-You never told me either.
-Come on, tell us.

1:04:44.708 --> 1:04:47.166
But you have to promise
not to tell anyone else.

1:04:49.541 --> 1:04:50.916
Last summer--

1:04:54.500 --> 1:04:56.250
Shit. That scared me.

1:04:57.958 --> 1:04:59.250
-Everything all right?
-Yes.

1:04:59.333 --> 1:05:01.541
Is this the apocalypse?

1:05:01.625 --> 1:05:03.333
-I'll light some candles.
-I'll help you.

1:05:03.416 --> 1:05:04.750
Got a light?

1:05:06.541 --> 1:05:08.166
Right, then.

1:05:08.791 --> 1:05:10.208
-Here.
-Hannah?

1:05:14.916 --> 1:05:15.958
Is everything okay?

1:05:22.416 --> 1:05:24.083
Hey, everything okay?

1:05:26.041 --> 1:05:29.041
I'm not sure.
I think I had déjà vu or something.

1:05:33.541 --> 1:05:36.666
This is going to sound
completely absurd, but...

1:05:38.250 --> 1:05:40.416
this is exactly

1:05:41.625 --> 1:05:43.333
what I dreamt last night.

1:05:44.958 --> 1:05:46.916
The light was flickering.

1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.708
There was a loud bang.

1:05:49.958 --> 1:05:52.958
And then suddenly everything was dark.

1:05:55.833 --> 1:05:57.166
And somehow...

1:05:58.625 --> 1:06:00.625
the world had ended.

1:06:01.916 --> 1:06:03.750
The world had ended?

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:06.708
Yeah, I don't know.

1:06:07.750 --> 1:06:10.333
It was just dark,
and it never became light again.

1:06:13.250 --> 1:06:15.500
I had this peculiar feeling...

1:06:19.708 --> 1:06:21.625
that it was a good thing...

1:06:23.375 --> 1:06:25.125
for everything to be over.

1:06:26.333 --> 1:06:29.541
Like suddenly being free of everything.

1:06:30.750 --> 1:06:32.291
No wanting.

1:06:33.625 --> 1:06:34.875
No having to.

1:06:39.416 --> 1:06:41.083
Infinite darkness.

1:06:44.666 --> 1:06:46.000
No yesterday.

1:06:46.833 --> 1:06:48.083
No today.

1:06:49.500 --> 1:06:50.750
No tomorrow.

1:06:54.833 --> 1:06:56.083
Nothing.

1:07:00.625 --> 1:07:03.166
You really need to get that looked into.

1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:10.666
Maybe it's the hormones.

1:07:12.416 --> 1:07:14.291
If the world were to end today,

1:07:14.791 --> 1:07:16.666
and you had one wish,

1:07:17.333 --> 1:07:19.041
what would you wish for?

1:07:24.041 --> 1:07:25.666
A world without Winden.

1:07:28.666 --> 1:07:29.750
Let's drink to that.

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:32.000
Yes.

1:07:32.083 --> 1:07:34.875
-A world without Winden.
-A world without Winden.

1:07:39.208 --> 1:07:41.750
Looks like Winden doesn't want
to just disappear.

1:07:43.583 --> 1:07:45.416
Maybe that's for the best.

1:07:49.291 --> 1:07:50.916
Do you already have a name?

1:07:55.958 --> 1:07:57.541
I don't know.

1:08:09.625 --> 1:08:11.708
I think Jonas is a beautiful name.

1:12:03.791 --> 1:12:07.083
