01:16.648 --> 01:17.915
Akaash!

01:28.915 --> 01:29.870
Vani!

01:42.870 --> 01:44.627
Why are you yelling
so early in the morning?

01:45.627 --> 01:47.292
When will he wake up?
When will he leave?

01:47.292 --> 01:48.844
Have you confirmed
the train timing?

01:49.844 --> 01:52.115
Yes, I checked. It's on time.

01:52.115 --> 01:53.578
I still say what's the need?

01:54.578 --> 01:56.758
Why go to Delhi?
She can get an education here.

01:56.758 --> 01:57.544
You will be going to drop him,
won't you?

01:58.544 --> 01:59.725
Why should I go?

01:59.725 --> 02:03.296
This is no time to discuss
this matter. Come to breakfast.

02:03.296 --> 02:04.908
I am ready.
Call the one who's going.

03:08.908 --> 03:09.700
Yes, Pinky. Tell me.

03:10.700 --> 03:10.603
What?

03:21.603 --> 03:22.415
Pinky's home is vacant.

03:24.415 --> 03:26.008
Her parents have gone to Himalaya.

03:27.008 --> 03:28.873
She asked me to come, mate.

04:59.873 --> 05:01.126
Kiddo!

05:07.126 --> 05:07.542
Hurry up!

05:12.542 --> 05:13.787
I love you.

05:16.787 --> 05:19.510
That's no proposal.
That was too stale.

05:20.510 --> 05:21.433
Do something interesting.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.683
Darling,
I'm crazy in love with you.

05:28.683 --> 05:31.642
My heart is crazy,
so I have these feelings.

05:32.642 --> 05:35.590
Please take the bride with you,
sweetheart.

05:37.590 --> 05:38.873
I love you too.

05:40.873 --> 05:42.912
Darling, I love you too.

05:42.912 --> 05:44.998
Although I never imagined
I would get so restless..

05:44.998 --> 05:46.440
..at the sight of you.
But this is no temporary love.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.366
I swear by Romeo and Juliet,
I love you too for posterity.

05:54.366 --> 05:55.767
That was good.

06:00.767 --> 06:03.859
Hi. Akaash.
English honors. - Vani. Me too.

06:04.859 --> 06:05.666
Me too.

06:06.666 --> 06:06.801
Class.

06:12.801 --> 06:13.426
Kiddo.

06:14.426 --> 06:15.452
Intro. - Akaash, Vani.

06:16.452 --> 06:19.162
I asked you your name,
not the radio station.

06:19.162 --> 06:20.888
Vani, Akaash.

06:20.888 --> 06:23.558
Whatever. Just do as you're told.

06:26.558 --> 06:27.424
Look at these two.

06:28.424 --> 06:31.926
Penny, dime, dollar.

06:32.926 --> 06:33.738
Got it?

06:34.738 --> 06:34.738
Start.

06:35.385 --> 06:37.409
Penny, dime, dollar.

06:38.409 --> 06:39.998
Penny, dime, dollar.

06:49.998 --> 06:51.399
Hi. Sumbodh.

06:51.399 --> 06:52.084
Shekhar.

06:53.084 --> 06:55.493
Hi. Let's have some introductions.

06:59.493 --> 07:01.176
Fool!
- Hey!

07:01.176 --> 07:03.054
It was good.

07:03.054 --> 07:04.066
It was good?

07:05.066 --> 07:05.780
Say thank you.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.905
What is this? - What is it?

07:10.905 --> 07:13.897
Crap! Dress code.

07:15.897 --> 07:16.527
What the hell!

07:18.527 --> 07:20.489
Guys, I look so hot.

07:22.489 --> 07:23.943
Very hot. Very hot.

07:24.943 --> 07:27.349
It's been my childhood fantasy.

07:27.349 --> 07:31.303
Pretty girls with two
braids and oil in the hair.

07:31.303 --> 07:34.061
Oil, oil! Oil, oil! Oil, oil!

07:42.061 --> 07:42.873
What's going on?

07:43.873 --> 07:46.169
We're watching Baywatch.

07:50.169 --> 07:52.791
You call that Baywatch.
With so much cover?

07:53.791 --> 07:55.602
Lazy woman!
You expect her to do everything?

07:56.602 --> 08:00.155
This is a college.
Use some imagination.

08:05.155 --> 08:07.967
Girls are no longer
interesting these days.

08:08.967 --> 08:10.792
You call that a figure?
Straight as a plank.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.012
There was a time when poets wrote..

08:14.012 --> 08:15.775
..rivers change their
path coming to your hip.

08:16.775 --> 08:18.496
What will they write now,
when there are no hips?

08:19.496 --> 08:21.626
My sight slipped this morning.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.914
How so? - Ask Vani.

08:25.914 --> 08:26.983
It's nothing.

08:27.983 --> 08:32.208
For the first time Vani fell
in love with me at first sight.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.731
She even said I love you.

08:38.731 --> 08:39.595
How do you know it's the first?

08:42.595 --> 08:44.442
It's her second or third love.

08:52.442 --> 08:54.379
So I can't get tea?

08:54.379 --> 08:56.059
Ask the first one to treat you.

09:04.059 --> 09:06.827
Hello. - Hi honey, what you doing?

09:07.827 --> 09:10.091
This is not the time
to call decent girls.

09:10.091 --> 09:16.240
Oh! Decent girls? Decent
girls are fast asleep by this time.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.187
Moreover decent girls
don't fall in love..

09:18.187 --> 09:19.692
..for the second and third time.

09:20.692 --> 09:23.135
I was going to launder
the clothes that's why I'm awake.

09:23.135 --> 09:26.087
Launder.
No problem. I'll see you there.

09:32.087 --> 09:34.514
Vani, I gave this a lot of thought..
and came to the decision..

09:34.514 --> 09:36.055
..I'm okay with being
the second or the third.

09:42.055 --> 09:43.588
And what if you're
the fourth or the fifth?

09:45.588 --> 09:49.197
Crap Vani. Seriously,
I didn't expect this of you.

09:50.197 --> 09:52.143
You are such a philanderer!

09:54.143 --> 09:56.718
Anyway, what good is angel
if I've fallen for a Jezebel?

09:57.718 --> 09:59.063
I'm Jezebel?

09:59.063 --> 10:02.332
You are.
But you're an awesome Jezebel.

10:03.332 --> 10:05.329
Everything seems yellow
to a jaundiced eye.

10:05.329 --> 10:09.319
That is true. Everyone
seems awesome for I am awesome.

10:49.319 --> 10:54.054
"One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven..

10:54.054 --> 10:56.836
..eight, nine, ten, eleven..

10:57.836 --> 10:59.759
A-B-C-D."

11:00.759 --> 11:02.158
What's your problem?

11:03.158 --> 11:06.832
To be or 32 B?
That is the question.

11:08.832 --> 11:10.338
I'll never do laundry with you.

11:10.338 --> 11:12.438
Even better.
Just give them to me, I'll do them.

11:13.438 --> 11:14.901
I love pink.

11:14.901 --> 11:17.024
Why do you say such crude things?

11:17.024 --> 11:18.962
You could say something cordial.

11:18.962 --> 11:22.632
Vani, Vani, Vani.
Cordiality is mere illusion.

11:23.632 --> 11:24.776
What did you bring to this world..

11:24.776 --> 11:26.346
..what will you take with you?

11:26.346 --> 11:28.615
You came bare skinned
and that's how you will depart.

11:29.615 --> 11:33.509
Vani, come out of all this talk,
rise up and move ahead.

11:35.509 --> 11:38.191
Bathe in the rivers
and defecate in the fields.

11:38.191 --> 11:40.975
Wake up, Vani. Wake up from..
- Shut up! -This false dream.

11:40.975 --> 11:41.774
Shut up!

11:41.774 --> 11:43.443
Wake up, Vani. - Shut up!

11:43.443 --> 11:43.478
Shut up!

12:13.478 --> 12:26.194
"Baby I, your crazy lover.
Baby I, your crazy lover."

12:39.194 --> 12:44.403
"Baby I, your crazy lover."

12:46.403 --> 12:51.832
"You smiling, me climbing tower."

12:53.832 --> 12:57.547
"Ho me climbing tower, tower.
Ho me climbing tower, tower."

12:57.547 --> 13:01.227
"Ho me climbing tower, tower.
Ho me climbing tower, tower."

13:01.227 --> 13:07.447
"Tower, baby, ta.
Oh my baby, ta. Oh my baby."

13:08.447 --> 13:13.842
"I cauli me cauliflower.

13:15.842 --> 13:20.851
"Baby I, your crazy lover."

13:26.851 --> 13:29.463
"Oh my baby, hug hug hurry."

13:30.463 --> 13:34.140
"I your teddy, warm n furry."

13:34.140 --> 13:37.847
"Let love be love.
Let not beat up."

13:37.847 --> 13:44.013
"I will glow you, don't you worry.
Sparkler."

13:45.013 --> 13:50.516
"I horse, you horse power."

13:52.516 --> 13:58.388
"Baby I, your crazy lover."

14:25.388 --> 14:29.111
"Listen lover, my honey."

14:29.111 --> 14:32.563
"Mister Playful, I no bunny."

14:32.563 --> 14:35.453
"Wherever I go, why you follow?"

14:36.453 --> 14:39.829
"Don't be cheap,
boy, and don't be funny."

14:39.829 --> 14:43.760
"Youth.."

14:43.760 --> 14:49.092
"I happy, you happy hour.

14:51.092 --> 14:56.472
"Wow o wow, my crazy lover."

14:58.472 --> 15:02.112
"Ho me climbing tower, tower.
Ho me climbing tower, tower."

15:02.112 --> 15:05.793
"Ho me climbing tower, tower.
Ho me climbing tower, tower."

15:05.793 --> 15:08.447
"Tower, baby, ta.
Oh my baby, ta. Oh my baby."

15:09.447 --> 15:13.114
"Tower, baby, ta.
Oh my baby, ta. Oh my baby."

15:13.114 --> 15:19.209
"Baby I, your crazy lover."

15:29.209 --> 15:32.639
Listen to me. - I don't
want to hear your crude talk.

15:32.639 --> 15:35.850
It's not crude.
I have changed. I'm a changed man.

15:36.850 --> 15:39.058
This is something very cordial.

15:40.058 --> 15:41.707
Listen to him, girl. Listen to him.

15:43.707 --> 15:44.439
Talk.

15:45.439 --> 15:47.514
That won't do.
Be a little more polite.

15:49.514 --> 15:50.933
Let's hear it.

15:50.933 --> 15:52.569
May I?

15:53.569 --> 15:55.309
Proceed.

15:56.309 --> 16:01.694
Seeing your face
surrounded by your hair..

16:02.694 --> 16:05.342
..the bulb felt the
moon appeared in the window.

16:10.342 --> 16:11.314
What?

16:11.314 --> 16:13.381
I want that bulb.
That particular one.

16:13.381 --> 16:14.563
I want to use only that one.

16:16.563 --> 16:19.679
Boy, your poetry lacks punch.

16:20.679 --> 16:21.828
Apparently you've
never been in love.

16:23.828 --> 16:24.588
Let me show you how it's done.

16:26.588 --> 16:29.376
Ladies? - Proceed.

16:31.376 --> 16:33.987
'My love exists even today.'

16:34.987 --> 16:37.900
'I long for your hair even today.'

16:38.900 --> 16:42.220
'Even today my nights
are spent thinking of you.'

16:42.220 --> 16:44.596
'My insane condition
exists even today.'

16:45.596 --> 16:48.059
'I don't like to see any other
My dishonest eyes..

16:48.059 --> 16:51.274
..have a modicum of decency
left in them even today.'

16:52.274 --> 16:54.615
'Love me once and then
leave me if you wish.'

16:55.615 --> 16:57.410
'Love me once and then
leave me if you wish.'

16:59.410 --> 17:02.894
'You have permission to break
my heart and leave even today.'

17:04.894 --> 17:05.742
Wonderful! - Wonderful!

17:06.742 --> 17:09.819
Wonderful! Absolutely wonderful!

17:10.819 --> 17:12.292
Did you learn anything?

17:13.292 --> 17:14.401
Learn from him.

17:16.401 --> 17:18.368
Are you guys done?

17:19.368 --> 17:20.823
Shall we go for a movie?

17:20.823 --> 17:24.258
Movie? No,
I have to go to my aunt's home.

17:24.258 --> 17:27.352
It will get very late.
Another time.

17:27.352 --> 17:30.217
Okay, bye. I got to go.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.571
She says "another time."

17:37.571 --> 17:39.022
Another time doesn't come.

17:42.022 --> 17:43.908
The heart is helpless without her.

17:44.908 --> 17:46.123
It refuses to lose
itself elsewhere.

17:48.123 --> 17:52.778
I ask for one breath,
one heartbeat, one look.

17:53.778 --> 17:55.045
She says, another time.

17:57.045 --> 17:59.121
But another time...

18:02.121 --> 18:03.179
..doesn't come.

18:09.179 --> 18:10.984
Are you going all by yourself?

18:11.984 --> 18:16.075
Of course. Who would
escort me so late at night?

18:17.075 --> 18:18.533
I'll do it. I'll drop you.

18:21.533 --> 18:23.763
Give me two minutes.
- Hold on, I'll join you.

18:24.763 --> 18:25.662
Bye, goodnight. - Goodnight.

18:28.662 --> 18:30.852
What the..! - What?

18:31.852 --> 18:34.867
Sheku, Sheku,
Shekhu, she is my Juliet.

18:35.867 --> 18:40.192
What now?
- Now go to bed and I'll drop her.

18:40.192 --> 18:40.782
Sure.

18:42.782 --> 18:43.435
Goodnight.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.594
Hi.

18:55.594 --> 18:56.897
Where is Shekhar?

18:56.897 --> 18:59.441
He's got diarrhoea.
So I told him not to worry.

18:59.441 --> 19:02.214
Take your time. I'll drop Vani.

19:04.214 --> 19:06.075
What? You don't believe me?

19:06.075 --> 19:07.456
The toilet is right here.
You want to hear?

19:08.456 --> 19:08.685
Shall we?

19:11.685 --> 19:12.900
Give me two minutes.

19:40.900 --> 19:41.757
Shall we?

19:52.757 --> 19:53.444
You look good.

19:56.444 --> 19:58.147
You realised it very soon.

19:59.147 --> 20:01.034
People who say
it quickly are liars.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.399
It takes time to get a good look.

20:07.399 --> 20:09.595
What's on your mind? - Nothing.

20:12.595 --> 20:14.910
I feel it takes the most
work thinking of nothing.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.073
That's what people
concentrate on the most.

20:20.073 --> 20:22.004
Incidentally if you're
thinking of me, I don't mind.

20:24.004 --> 20:25.747
You wish. - I do.

20:28.747 --> 20:29.804
Vani, I do!

20:30.804 --> 20:31.920
I do!

21:49.920 --> 21:50.641
We've arrived.

21:58.641 --> 22:00.267
Go on inside.

22:01.267 --> 22:02.419
We'll meet on Monday.

22:04.419 --> 22:06.436
Will you return on
Monday or tomorrow evening?

22:08.436 --> 22:09.830
Monday morning.

22:13.830 --> 22:14.704
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

22:36.704 --> 22:39.595
'I wonder what it is about
her that I don't see in others.'

22:41.595 --> 22:45.704
'Those eyes are so bewitching,
I can't look away.'

22:46.704 --> 22:49.916
'What is it that
perplexes me the most?'

22:50.916 --> 22:54.758
'What is it that I can't
get out of my senses?'

23:10.758 --> 23:11.798
Hi.

23:12.798 --> 23:14.486
Where were you?
The class is going to Manali.

23:15.486 --> 23:17.530
I hope we're going?
I love the hills.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.658
Of course. I love hills.

23:31.658 --> 23:32.409
You know what?

23:33.409 --> 23:33.559
What?

23:35.559 --> 23:37.281
I love hills.

23:39.281 --> 23:40.166
I do.

23:40.166 --> 23:44.428
I know. Listen, you won't
find a better opportunity.

23:45.428 --> 23:47.588
The hills, cold romantic weather.
What more could you ask for?

23:49.588 --> 23:49.775
Tell her.

23:52.775 --> 23:54.191
Yes.

24:36.191 --> 24:37.248
Goodnight.

24:38.248 --> 24:38.600
Goodnight.

24:56.600 --> 24:56.859
Vani.

24:59.859 --> 25:00.865
Vani.

25:01.865 --> 25:02.977
Hmm.

25:06.977 --> 25:07.783
Vani.

25:08.783 --> 25:10.794
Hmm.

25:14.794 --> 25:15.973
Vani.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.788
Hmm.

25:21.788 --> 25:22.704
Good morning.

25:23.704 --> 25:25.971
To hell with your good morning.

25:25.971 --> 25:27.692
Wake up, get ready.
It is eight o' clock.

25:28.692 --> 25:31.108
And you leave the room.
Let her get ready.

25:35.108 --> 25:37.283
Girls look so pretty early
in the morning, don't they?

25:38.283 --> 25:40.246
Oh lover boy!

25:41.246 --> 25:44.249
Listen. Tell her today.
First chance you get.

25:44.249 --> 25:46.444
I'll divert Sumbodh's attention.
You tell her.

25:47.444 --> 25:49.296
Cool? - Dermicool.

26:10.296 --> 26:12.297
Sorry. You got
delayed because of me.

26:13.297 --> 26:15.845
It's okay. There was no hurry.

26:16.845 --> 26:17.821
Shall we? - Let's go.

26:24.821 --> 26:26.465
What's the matter?
Is your tongue frozen in this cold?

26:27.465 --> 26:30.284
Listen. I'll call Sumbody
here and you tell her.

26:30.284 --> 26:32.855
It would inappropriate
here in public.

26:32.855 --> 26:34.879
If she gets upset people
will think I'm eve teasing her.

26:34.879 --> 26:36.532
That's fine. If she screams here..

26:36.532 --> 26:38.362
..people won't know
why she screamed.

26:39.362 --> 26:41.519
Yes, you're right.
They have such fine eyes.

26:42.519 --> 26:43.898
Nobody will hear.

26:44.898 --> 26:47.320
Sumbodh! Look at this.

27:10.320 --> 27:14.259
Vani, I have something to tell you.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.199
Yes, tell me.

27:18.199 --> 27:19.132
Tell me.

27:23.132 --> 27:25.397
This shawl looks good on you.

27:30.397 --> 27:34.361
So gift it to me. Go on. Gift it.

27:38.361 --> 27:40.086
Two thousand two hundred.

27:40.086 --> 27:40.567
Your eyes are open?

27:43.567 --> 27:47.198
You're back deflated?
What was her response?

27:47.198 --> 27:50.206
I bet she said,
you are such a big coward.

27:50.206 --> 27:51.506
I bet you couldn't say one word.

27:52.506 --> 27:55.492
I haven't seen a bigger
mouse than you in all my life.

27:56.492 --> 27:59.304
You are a good for nothing.

27:59.304 --> 28:03.894
You don't have guts.
Get out of my sight!

28:05.894 --> 28:07.669
Akash, Vani, next scene. Start.

28:12.669 --> 28:14.748
I've been meaning
to tell you something.

28:18.748 --> 28:19.746
Again.

28:26.746 --> 28:29.121
I want to tell you that I..

28:30.121 --> 28:30.463
Tell me.

28:33.463 --> 28:35.109
I want to tell you..

28:37.109 --> 28:37.642
that I..

28:38.642 --> 28:43.121
Crap! - I can't believe it.
I can't believe it!

28:44.121 --> 28:46.248
Come. Let's go to the roof.

28:51.248 --> 28:54.047
You proceed. I'll go get a candle.

29:42.047 --> 29:50.030
"I sold my soul for you."

29:53.030 --> 30:00.711
"I lost my heart and
found haven in your heart."

30:09.711 --> 30:17.955
"I sold my soul for you."

30:17.955 --> 30:25.737
"I lost my heart and
found haven in your heart."

30:26.737 --> 30:31.258
"This news was
published in the paper."

30:32.258 --> 30:36.886
"This news was
published in the paper."

30:37.886 --> 30:52.062
"I am.. I am..
Yes, I am in love with you."

30:53.062 --> 31:03.099
"In love with you.
In love with you."

31:05.099 --> 31:12.909
"I sought refuge in your breath."

31:15.909 --> 31:36.078
"It was morning by the
time I expressed it to you."

31:36.078 --> 31:50.237
"I am.. I am..
Yes, I am in love with you."

31:51.237 --> 32:01.877
"In love with you.
In love with you."

32:13.877 --> 32:19.371
"I've forfeited my
friendship with shame."

32:19.371 --> 32:23.464
"The whole class is envious of us."

32:30.464 --> 32:35.997
"I've forfeited my
friendship with shame."

32:35.997 --> 32:40.955
"The whole class is envious of us."

32:40.955 --> 32:46.628
"I've written your
name even on the walls."

32:46.628 --> 32:51.604
"I am openly staring at you."

32:53.604 --> 33:04.634
"Telling you publicly.
Telling you publicly."

33:04.634 --> 33:16.121
"I am.. I am..
Yes, I am in love with you."

33:17.121 --> 33:27.452
"In love with you.
In love with you."

34:21.452 --> 34:26.771
"I bloom in the
sunshine during summer."

34:26.771 --> 34:33.092
"When my fingers
play on your body."

34:38.092 --> 34:43.190
"I bloom in the
sunshine during summer."

34:43.190 --> 34:48.304
"When my fingers
play on your body."

34:48.304 --> 34:54.032
"Months and years
passing in your company."

34:54.032 --> 34:59.889
"My life I owned you."

35:00.889 --> 35:05.432
"The two paths meet."

35:06.432 --> 35:12.054
"The two paths meet."

35:12.054 --> 35:25.233
"I am.. I am..
Yes, I am in love with you."

35:27.233 --> 35:36.258
"In love with you.
In love with you."

35:38.258 --> 35:48.541
"In love with you.
In love with you."

36:07.541 --> 36:08.671
Akaash.

36:12.671 --> 36:16.804
Only two months left.
Then we'll be separated.

36:18.804 --> 36:20.764
I wish we could spend
life as we are now.

36:21.764 --> 36:25.363
No studies. No job..

36:29.363 --> 36:32.626
We have to work hard if
you want to spend life like this.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.523
How will you find
a job if you don't study?

36:38.523 --> 36:41.673
If you don't find a job..
How will you speak to my parents?

36:43.673 --> 36:46.689
And if you don't speak
to my parents, how can we marry?

36:48.689 --> 36:52.077
If we don't get married
how will we go on our honeymoon?

36:53.077 --> 36:56.269
Is that why you want to marry?
- Of course.

37:05.269 --> 37:07.282
By the way, where will we go?

37:07.282 --> 37:10.492
Anywhere.
I just want a good mattress.

37:16.492 --> 37:19.030
We'll go somewhere far.
On the hills.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.175
A place that's not too crowded.

37:24.175 --> 37:29.686
Somewhere very cold,
with snow and bright sun.

37:31.686 --> 37:33.561
A cottage on hills.

37:35.561 --> 37:40.269
Sunlight should filter into
my room first when the sun rises.

37:42.269 --> 37:44.903
First or last?

37:46.903 --> 37:47.490
Okay, okay.

37:51.490 --> 37:56.227
A dirt track on which we
go for a walk in the mornings.

37:58.227 --> 38:02.291
With a tiny tea stall
further up the dirt track.

38:02.291 --> 38:03.707
Tea? - Tea.

38:04.707 --> 38:05.934
Why?

38:06.934 --> 38:10.679
And after tea you will
prepare breakfast for me.

38:16.679 --> 38:19.410
A lake where we can go boating.

38:21.410 --> 38:22.441
Where I can touch the clouds.

38:23.441 --> 38:25.974
In school girls called me Badal.

38:26.974 --> 38:32.659
One girl touched me..
- And when we return..

38:33.659 --> 38:36.352
..in the evening there
will be sudden rainfall.

38:36.352 --> 38:38.358
And we'll get wet while
running to take cover..

38:38.358 --> 38:39.827
..under a small ledge.

38:40.827 --> 38:44.015
And from there.. - And from there?

38:45.015 --> 38:46.651
From there.

38:47.651 --> 38:48.677
Yes.

38:48.677 --> 38:52.376
From there we'll go to a
nice place for candlelight dinner.

38:52.376 --> 38:55.260
Then we'll return in leisure
and light up some firewood..

38:55.260 --> 38:57.827
..get under the blanket
together to warm our hands.

38:58.827 --> 38:59.861
And..?

39:02.861 --> 39:04.139
And..

39:05.139 --> 39:05.767
And..?

39:07.767 --> 39:09.334
And..

39:12.334 --> 39:13.974
we'll go to sleep.

39:15.974 --> 39:18.717
For you to think
so far is sufficient.

39:19.717 --> 39:21.709
Leave the rest
of the worries to me.

39:21.709 --> 39:25.077
Yes. You will do what
you want all on your own.

39:26.077 --> 39:27.289
So why should I worry.

39:29.289 --> 39:30.104
We shall see.

39:31.104 --> 39:32.238
What will you see?

39:36.238 --> 39:39.188
Sure.
You're being very brave right now.

39:40.188 --> 39:42.836
We'll see how you behave
when you tell your parents.

39:43.836 --> 39:44.919
I'd like to see you
speak this way then.

39:46.919 --> 39:48.564
You must say the wrong thing
at the wrong time, don't you?

39:59.564 --> 40:01.468
I wonder how my parents will react.

40:04.468 --> 40:07.338
I'm not worried about mummy,
but papa?

40:09.338 --> 40:11.113
When are you planning
on telling them?

40:13.113 --> 40:14.700
When you come to sister's wedding..

40:14.700 --> 40:16.771
..I'll introduce you to them then,
hopefully.

40:17.771 --> 40:19.894
Everyone will be happy so
the chances will be better then.

40:21.894 --> 40:25.150
And what if they refuse?

40:35.150 --> 40:35.673
I don't know.

40:41.673 --> 40:42.843
Okay listen..

40:43.843 --> 40:46.260
..do you want the honeymoon
to be exactly as you described it..

40:46.260 --> 40:47.802
..or will something similar do?

40:52.802 --> 40:54.137
Will do.

40:54.137 --> 40:56.490
Listen. We'll go to
a deserted ranch far away..

40:57.490 --> 40:59.943
..where there's nobody
but horses and us..

40:59.943 --> 41:02.919
..where we can brazenly
run amok naked.

41:02.919 --> 41:04.903
Where we can jump up
and down to break mangoes..

41:04.903 --> 41:05.461
..off a mango tree.

41:06.461 --> 41:07.997
And there should be a pond..

41:07.997 --> 41:09.784
..where the crocodile
would blush watching us kiss.

41:13.784 --> 41:14.793
You're coarse.

41:15.793 --> 41:16.776
What's coarse about it?

41:17.776 --> 41:19.963
What else do you expect
to do on the honeymoon?

41:21.963 --> 41:29.197
Darling, honeymoon is
a three letter word. S-E-X.

41:29.197 --> 41:29.914
Cheap!

41:32.914 --> 41:34.798
Okay baby, it's a four letter word.

41:38.798 --> 41:41.847
F-U-C..

43:10.847 --> 43:15.262
Put the remaining flowers
up on that corner. It'll fill up.

43:15.262 --> 43:18.470
Excuse me. Call Shivani
and find out where she is.

43:19.470 --> 43:21.073
She said she'd be
back in two hours..

43:21.073 --> 43:22.407
..and hasn't returned as yet.
It's almost eight.

43:23.407 --> 43:24.432
The henna artist
arrived so long ago.

43:25.432 --> 43:26.704
She's gone to see her friends.
She'll be here soon.

43:27.704 --> 43:29.938
Meanwhile get her to
apply henna on the others.

43:30.938 --> 43:32.758
It adds up to one
hundred twenty-five.

43:32.758 --> 43:33.977
How does it add up
to one hundred twenty-five?

43:33.977 --> 43:36.285
You know what I miss most?

43:36.285 --> 43:37.220
You know what I miss most? - What?

43:37.220 --> 43:40.586
Your stomach.
Soft, cushiony and ticklish.

43:41.586 --> 43:43.374
Is that all you're missing?

43:43.374 --> 43:47.950
I'm missing many things. But if
I mention them I'll think of them.

43:47.950 --> 43:51.704
If I think, it will be very hard.
Stay away.

43:52.704 --> 43:54.938
Then I'll have to come. To you.

43:55.938 --> 43:58.139
It's good. You're getting practice.

43:59.139 --> 44:02.291
That's exactly what you'll
have to do when you go to UK.

44:02.291 --> 44:03.271
Manage.

44:05.271 --> 44:08.398
Why don't you go too?
Prepare for an MBA.

44:08.398 --> 44:10.305
Go to a decent place.

44:10.305 --> 44:12.784
Sure, that's what you will say.

44:12.784 --> 44:14.682
After all your
departure is confirmed.

44:15.682 --> 44:18.021
When will you be leaving?
- After fifteen days.

44:19.021 --> 44:21.380
We shall romance
on skype hereafter.

44:23.380 --> 44:25.597
I have to introduce you
to my parents before you leave.

44:26.597 --> 44:30.756
I told sister about you.
Her reaction unsettled me further.

44:31.756 --> 44:33.347
Why? What did she say?

44:33.347 --> 44:37.338
Not much. But she thinks
it's impossible to convince papa.

44:38.338 --> 44:40.950
Anyway, you'll be arriving
the day after tomorrow, right?

44:40.950 --> 44:44.773
Vani! - Akash, mum is calling.
We'll talk later.

44:45.773 --> 44:46.537
Bye.

44:48.537 --> 44:50.619
Come here, sister.
Apply henna with me.

44:50.619 --> 44:52.396
I'll apply it when sister comes.

44:54.396 --> 44:54.586
Yes, mom?

45:43.586 --> 45:45.961
Were uncle and aunt
unaware or did they object?

45:48.961 --> 45:50.276
They knew.

45:51.276 --> 45:52.898
They objected to his caste.

45:52.898 --> 45:54.769
Whoever thinks about
the caste these days?

46:01.769 --> 46:07.287
I'll be leaving in two weeks.
The ticket has been booked.

46:11.287 --> 46:13.365
You won't be able to make it,
will you?

46:15.365 --> 46:16.644
It's entirely
impossible at this time.

46:19.644 --> 46:23.637
No problem. I'll try to
return during winter vacation.

46:25.637 --> 46:28.541
I'll hang up now, Akash.
I'll call you later.

46:31.541 --> 46:33.686
Okay. You take care.

46:48.686 --> 46:50.476
But I don't understand
how this happened.

46:51.476 --> 46:53.001
Such a good girl!

46:53.001 --> 46:56.184
For something like this
to happen to a girl like Shivani.

46:56.184 --> 46:56.573
I never imagined it.

46:57.573 --> 46:59.539
Every time I see Vani,
I feel she should have considered..

47:00.539 --> 47:04.079
..the fact she
has a sister at home.

47:04.079 --> 47:04.577
Let's go, mum.

47:06.577 --> 47:11.901
Why do you even listen to her?
This is all she knows to do.

47:12.901 --> 47:14.787
She's not saying
anything incorrect.

47:15.787 --> 47:18.191
Everything she said was true,
wasn't it?

47:36.191 --> 47:39.780
Sandip mentioned he saw
her with someone in the mall.

47:40.780 --> 47:42.068
One week back.

47:43.068 --> 47:46.342
But one can't guess
who it might be.

47:46.342 --> 47:47.930
He thought it must be a friend.

47:48.930 --> 47:53.506
The kids these get so friendly, one
can't tell if it is a friend or..

47:57.506 --> 47:59.901
We never expected anything
of this sort to happen.

48:00.901 --> 48:03.276
We thought that she
is getting married so..

48:04.276 --> 48:07.188
Parents put in so much
love to raise their children..

48:08.188 --> 48:12.646
..but the kids don't
give any thought to..

48:33.646 --> 48:35.655
Did you know beforehand
this was going to happen?

50:02.655 --> 50:05.358
5 year reputation..

50:11.358 --> 50:17.115
Children shouldn't shred their
parents' dignity in this manner.

50:23.115 --> 50:23.646
Shouldn't.

50:37.646 --> 50:39.784
She.. She loved him.

50:43.784 --> 50:44.820
And what of our love?

50:49.820 --> 51:02.017
This fresh love means
more than our 24 year old love.

51:22.017 --> 51:22.501
You tell me too..

51:24.501 --> 51:26.302
You tell me too..

51:30.302 --> 51:33.628
if you love someone..

52:37.628 --> 52:38.519
How's your preparation?

52:40.519 --> 52:42.655
I'm working on it.

52:43.655 --> 52:44.492
Have things improved at home?

52:45.492 --> 52:48.778
No. And even if I try to
change things nobody lets me do it.

52:50.778 --> 52:52.878
It's been six months but..

52:53.878 --> 52:56.095
Have you thought about
telling uncle and aunty about us?

52:57.095 --> 52:57.918
Not yet.

52:59.918 --> 53:01.709
I don't think they can take it yet.

53:02.709 --> 53:05.179
You have to tell them sometime.

53:06.179 --> 53:08.110
Yes, but there's no
particular hurry, is there?

53:09.110 --> 53:12.050
Right. I have a class.
I'll call you after.

53:12.050 --> 53:12.646
Listen..

53:15.646 --> 53:17.590
Love you. - Love you too.

53:27.590 --> 53:29.836
I discussed it at the
office just this morning.

53:29.836 --> 53:33.282
Mr. Vele has a brother in Kanpur.
It's his son.

53:33.282 --> 53:35.829
He's done IMA from IIT Kanpur.

53:36.829 --> 53:38.457
He's been offered a package
worth 1.6 million in Bangalore.

53:40.457 --> 53:44.760
But so early..
- They're good people. Good family.

53:45.760 --> 53:48.108
I don't want to
delay it any longer.

53:51.108 --> 53:55.930
She wishes to do MBA.
And she's so young.

53:58.930 --> 54:01.320
I've seen the outcome
of one's wishes.

54:02.320 --> 54:03.447
They're coming over on Sunday.
Let her know.

54:29.447 --> 54:29.789
Hi.

54:33.789 --> 54:35.396
Can we talk later?

54:37.396 --> 54:38.323
Okay.

54:41.323 --> 54:42.267
Me too.

57:08.267 --> 57:10.019
You're kidding, right?

57:11.019 --> 57:11.523
No Akash.

57:13.523 --> 57:14.436
Didn't you tell them.. - I can't.

57:17.436 --> 57:19.492
I can't tell them.
- What can't you do?

57:20.492 --> 57:23.117
If you can't tell them now..
then just buy some time.

57:23.117 --> 57:25.338
Tell them you don't
want to marry now.

57:25.338 --> 57:26.483
I'll come down during
the upcoming holidays.

57:27.483 --> 57:28.711
It's not that simple.

57:30.711 --> 57:32.994
My parents are happy
after a long time.

57:34.994 --> 57:37.577
You want even I should..
- You're being foolish, Vani?

57:38.577 --> 57:41.253
And us? Damn it! What about us?

57:42.253 --> 57:43.657
I'm coming. Somehow..
- No Akash..

57:45.657 --> 57:46.468
..you will do no such thing.

57:47.468 --> 57:49.780
You aren't the only one who's
entitled to make this decision.

57:49.780 --> 57:51.215
This involves my life too.

57:52.215 --> 57:53.160
I'm sorry.

57:56.160 --> 57:56.700
I love you..

58:00.700 --> 58:01.611
but not more than my parents.

58:02.611 --> 58:04.816
Bullshit Vani,
this is not a competition!

58:05.816 --> 58:07.363
Okay, let me come
and then we'll talk.

58:07.363 --> 58:08.247
No.

58:09.247 --> 58:10.425
I don't want you coming
here and creating a scene.

58:12.425 --> 58:13.599
I can't make my parents
go through it again.

58:15.599 --> 58:17.030
So this is it?

58:18.030 --> 58:21.077
A four year old relationship
ending with one phone call.

58:23.077 --> 58:24.749
Don't make it more
difficult for me.

58:26.749 --> 58:27.832
I wish you'd understand.

58:27.832 --> 58:29.945
What am I to understand, Vani?
What am I to understand?

58:29.945 --> 58:32.262
Four years of my life become
meaningless in one moment.

58:32.262 --> 58:33.934
I should forget everything..

58:33.934 --> 58:36.371
..I planned during the
past four years of my life?

58:36.371 --> 58:37.374
I should change it?

58:37.374 --> 58:40.900
Or am I to understand that
the relation I had visions about..

58:40.900 --> 58:43.651
..is merely a dream. I woke
up and my dream was shattered.

58:45.651 --> 58:47.240
Even my dream is shattered..

58:50.240 --> 58:51.642
but.. - But what, Vani? But what?

58:55.642 --> 58:56.707
Think of it this way.

58:58.707 --> 59:00.441
I can shatter our dream..

59:03.441 --> 59:04.599
..but I cannot break
my parents' hearts.

59:05.599 --> 59:07.657
Vani.. - Bye Akash.

59:07.657 --> 59:09.994
Va.. Vani..?

59:32.994 --> 59:34.724
Akash, no matter
what Vani says to you..

59:34.724 --> 59:36.180
..I think you should come down.

59:36.180 --> 59:39.622
No, I don't want any
relationship with a girl..

59:40.622 --> 59:42.939
..who doesn't have the
courage to say she loves me.

59:42.939 --> 59:44.896
Nonsense! You know that's not..

59:44.896 --> 59:49.354
No Sundari,
if she feels she should do this..

59:50.354 --> 59:51.510
..if she feels this is right..

59:53.510 --> 59:55.336
..if she wants to be a martyr..

59:59.349 --> 01:00:00.997
Then that is what she should do.

01:00:02.997 --> 01:00:07.249
If she can end this relationship
so easily without seeing me once..

01:00:09.249 --> 01:00:12.291
..even I won't try to
convince her not to leave me.

01:00:18.291 --> 01:00:21.070
I'm willing to fight
others for her..

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:24.887
..but I refuse to
fight her for her love.

01:00:30.887 --> 01:00:33.332
Tell her to send me an invite.

01:00:34.332 --> 01:00:36.972
Surely I deserve this
much for the four years.

01:01:02.972 --> 01:01:08.977
"That which I think
of and break into laughter."

01:01:09.977 --> 01:01:17.099
"That which I think
of and break into laughter."

01:01:17.099 --> 01:01:28.064
"It was a coincidence.
It was a joke between you and me."

01:01:28.064 --> 01:01:39.220
"It was a coincidence.
It was a joke between you and me."

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:45.581
"That which I think
of and break into laughter."

01:01:46.581 --> 01:01:52.688
"That which I think
of and break into laughter."

01:01:53.688 --> 01:02:02.682
"It was a coincidence.
It was a joke between you and me."

01:02:04.682 --> 01:02:13.811
"It was a coincidence.
It was a joke between you and me."

01:02:52.811 --> 01:03:05.624
"We got together all in fun.
I turned into a lane."

01:03:07.624 --> 01:03:21.284
"We got together all in fun.
I turned into a lane."

01:03:22.284 --> 01:03:34.459
"The lane broke off
after a little way."

01:03:36.459 --> 01:03:45.157
"A broken down house
was at the fork on that lane."

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:58.222
"It was a coincidence.
It was a joke between you and me."

01:03:58.222 --> 01:04:08.939
"It was a coincidence.
It was a joke between you and me."

01:04:09.939 --> 01:04:22.566
"It's in the light memories.
Written on musty old books."

01:04:24.566 --> 01:04:31.351
"It can't be forgettable."

01:06:36.351 --> 01:06:41.394
"Best wishes, dearest.
Best wishes."

01:06:41.394 --> 01:06:45.592
"Best wishes, dearest.
Best wishes."

01:06:46.592 --> 01:06:55.361
"Best wishes, dearest.
To all yours beloved, best wishes."

01:06:55.361 --> 01:07:00.389
"Best wishes, dearest.
Best wishes."

01:07:00.389 --> 01:07:04.608
"Best wishes, dearest.
Best wishes."

01:07:13.608 --> 01:07:14.898
I'll go change.

01:07:17.898 --> 01:07:19.258
You look good just as you are.

01:07:26.258 --> 01:07:27.184
Enough.

01:07:29.184 --> 01:07:31.329
I'm not ready yet.

01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.821
Nobody is.

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:43.406
You know,
Vani, I've been asking him..

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:46.775
..how he found a
pretty girl like you?

01:10:47.775 --> 01:10:48.890
Yeah, yeah. Pour the drinks.

01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:53.946
Okay. Vani, you'll have?
- No, I don't drink.

01:10:53.946 --> 01:10:56.031
Really? You're never had it before?

01:10:56.031 --> 01:10:58.515
Two or three times with my
friends from college. That's it.

01:11:00.515 --> 01:11:03.131
Rustle up some snacks. - Sure.

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:11.305
Have you made any headway?

01:11:12.305 --> 01:11:12.746
No, mate.

01:11:13.746 --> 01:11:14.903
I don't want to.

01:11:15.903 --> 01:11:18.217
In the beginning one
should spend time talking..

01:11:18.217 --> 01:11:21.146
..and getting comfortable
with each other.

01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:22.503
That's true.

01:11:36.503 --> 01:11:38.970
What else have you done? Tell me.

01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:45.840
Besides alcohol what else
did you try in college? Tell me.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.510
Nothing. Some friends..
- Don't you have any sense?

01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:53.767
You want to tell people
my wife drinks alcohol.

01:11:54.767 --> 01:11:57.140
Keep your mouth shut
if you don't have any sense.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.948
Will you get into bed now or
you need a peg to put you to sleep?

01:13:22.948 --> 01:13:23.643
Were you asleep?

01:13:24.643 --> 01:13:25.995
It took you so long
to open the door.

01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:34.053
You got very late today.

01:13:36.053 --> 01:13:38.648
Yes. It did get late;
I was hanging out with my friends..

01:13:40.648 --> 01:13:43.379
..next time I will take
your permission before leaving.

01:13:56.379 --> 01:13:57.452
Hello! Hi!

01:14:00.452 --> 01:14:01.992
Please make me some tea.

01:14:03.992 --> 01:14:04.909
Yeah.

01:14:19.909 --> 01:14:21.317
Should I serve dinner?

01:14:23.317 --> 01:14:25.068
Do you want to sleep?

01:14:26.068 --> 01:14:26.884
No.

01:14:26.884 --> 01:14:28.785
Then can't you see I am having tea.

01:14:32.785 --> 01:14:35.960
What have you done throughout
the day that you are so tired?

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.728
Did I complain to
you about anything?

01:14:39.728 --> 01:14:42.711
No. but it seems like you
are serving me two meals a day..

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:43.768
..as if doing some charity.

01:14:44.768 --> 01:14:46.858
Today I am little late and looks
like your sleep has been disturbed.

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:50.469
You go rest.
I will reheat the food myself.

01:14:51.469 --> 01:14:54.058
Don't be under this impression
that you are doing a lot of work.

01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:55.709
I can manage by myself.

01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:06.080
You have not even
added sugar to this tea.

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:10.124
I must have forgotten,
let me get it.

01:15:10.124 --> 01:15:11.018
Let it be.

01:15:12.018 --> 01:15:12.991
You can't even make
a simple tea properly.

01:15:24.991 --> 01:15:25.689
Serve the dinner.

01:15:30.689 --> 01:15:35.032
I am not feeling well,
can you please help yourself?

01:15:35.032 --> 01:15:36.344
What happened?

01:15:36.344 --> 01:15:41.110
My periods started today,
it's paining a little more.

01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:43.040
I have already prepared dinner.
Please reheat.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.195
No one told me after marriage
I will have to serve my own dinner.

01:16:05.195 --> 01:16:06.689
You leave, I will do it.

01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:08.528
Are you feeling better already?

01:16:10.528 --> 01:16:11.826
You sleep, I shall get it.

01:16:14.826 --> 01:16:15.451
I am feeling alright.

01:16:17.451 --> 01:16:19.000
Are you sure?

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.103
Else throughout lifetime
you will taunt me about this.

01:16:31.103 --> 01:16:31.606
Water.

01:16:38.606 --> 01:16:39.472
My parents had called today..

01:16:40.472 --> 01:16:43.631
..they were missing us and
invited us to visit them.

01:16:44.631 --> 01:16:45.702
We shall go next month.

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:47.887
They'll be happy.

01:16:56.887 --> 01:16:58.036
Today my mother had called..

01:17:00.036 --> 01:17:00.853
Said me to come for someday..

01:17:04.853 --> 01:17:07.192
..she told me she
had a word with you and..

01:17:08.192 --> 01:17:09.759
..that you agreed we will
celebrate Diwali there with them.

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:13.900
Why you do one thing,
take a long vacation..

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:16.611
..and stay there
properly for a long time.

01:17:18.611 --> 01:17:19.608
You..
- You don't like it here isn't it?

01:17:20.608 --> 01:17:22.634
Better you stay with
your parents only.

01:17:22.634 --> 01:17:25.103
Why do we continue
these charades everyday?

01:17:25.103 --> 01:17:26.737
But you yourself promised mom..
- What else could I say?

01:17:27.737 --> 01:17:29.394
You deliberately
made her invite me,

01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:31.947
Why should I say the truth and look
bad. You yourself must realise.

01:17:33.947 --> 01:17:35.129
Damn why did I married?

01:17:50.129 --> 01:17:51.339
Are there more bread?

01:17:55.339 --> 01:17:56.503
I will make them.

01:17:57.503 --> 01:17:58.540
Leave it.

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:02.906
Next time count more and make.

01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:16.295
Listen! Next week
I am going to Hyderabad.

01:18:17.295 --> 01:18:18.525
There is a course
in ISB for a week.

01:18:20.525 --> 01:18:22.054
Please pack my stuff accordingly.

01:18:35.054 --> 01:18:37.839
I was thinking now that
everything is settled..

01:18:39.839 --> 01:18:42.187
..and even you leave early
in the morning for work..

01:18:42.187 --> 01:18:43.615
Then there is nothing
to do throughout the day.

01:18:46.615 --> 01:18:49.326
I was thinking to look out for
a good college here and pursue MBA.

01:18:49.326 --> 01:18:50.318
What's the need?

01:18:51.318 --> 01:18:53.929
You are not going to take
up any job then what's the point?

01:18:54.929 --> 01:18:55.978
Still I'm..

01:18:55.978 --> 01:18:59.307
Anyways, we must start a
family at the end of this year...

01:18:59.307 --> 01:19:00.964
..in the middle of that..
- So soon?

01:19:00.964 --> 01:19:03.321
I had already made
it clear to your parents..

01:19:04.321 --> 01:19:06.012
..that I need a housewife..

01:19:08.012 --> 01:19:08.643
..and once we have a child..

01:19:09.643 --> 01:19:11.616
..all these useless things
won't come in your head.

01:19:19.616 --> 01:19:19.740
And yes..

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.902
Ashok was asking about
watching a film this Saturday.

01:19:23.902 --> 01:19:25.173
He has booked the tickets.

01:19:37.173 --> 01:19:37.714
Bye.
- Bye.

01:19:42.714 --> 01:19:43.723
Shall I serve you dinner?

01:19:46.723 --> 01:19:50.193
Don't you bother!
I will help myself.

01:19:50.193 --> 01:19:51.648
Why are you getting angry?

01:19:52.648 --> 01:19:54.888
I went only after
taking your permission.

01:19:54.888 --> 01:19:56.509
And after..
-Taking permission? Or informing?

01:19:57.509 --> 01:19:59.180
Permission was a drama.

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:02.981
You knew very well, I couldn't
say no in front of your friend.

01:20:03.981 --> 01:20:09.329
No problem, you have fun,
hang out with friends, enjoy..

01:20:12.329 --> 01:20:13.622
He was Kirti's friend not mine..

01:20:15.622 --> 01:20:17.756
And I didn't even know
he would be accompanying.

01:20:17.756 --> 01:20:24.067
Oh so, you are staying
out with strangers till 11pm.

01:20:31.067 --> 01:20:32.835
Ravi, what do you
expect from me after all?

01:20:34.835 --> 01:20:35.887
What do I want?

01:20:35.887 --> 01:20:38.177
You tell me what do you expect..

01:20:38.177 --> 01:20:40.942
..if you have any desires
like your sister.

01:20:41.942 --> 01:20:44.161
How come you are dragging
my sister into this?

01:20:47.161 --> 01:20:49.070
Both of you are made
of the same blood.

01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:51.532
Whose blood is how
can be clearly seen.

01:20:53.532 --> 01:20:55.055
Pack your bags and leave.

01:20:56.055 --> 01:20:56.553
This is my house.

01:20:57.553 --> 01:20:59.957
If you want to stay then
stay on my terms or get out.

01:21:08.957 --> 01:21:11.911
He misbehaves all the time.

01:21:12.911 --> 01:21:13.482
I can't stay with him.

01:21:16.482 --> 01:21:17.643
Did he hit you?

01:21:17.643 --> 01:21:18.826
No mother.

01:21:18.826 --> 01:21:19.112
Then?

01:21:21.112 --> 01:21:23.954
Fighting over small things.
He has problem with everything.

01:21:24.954 --> 01:21:27.117
It's not as if I don't try..

01:21:27.117 --> 01:21:29.679
..but no matter what I do, it's
like he is just fond of fighting.

01:21:30.679 --> 01:21:32.027
I feel suffocated being with him.

01:21:34.027 --> 01:21:35.460
You don't worry,
we will talk to him.

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:39.339
All this happens,
everything will be fine.

01:21:39.339 --> 01:21:42.642
Previously also you spoke to him and
that only resulted in more fights.

01:21:42.642 --> 01:21:44.634
He blamed me for defaming him,
I can't stay with him.

01:21:44.634 --> 01:21:46.738
If you fight over small
things and come to our home..

01:21:46.738 --> 01:21:48.097
He is bound to feel bad.

01:21:49.097 --> 01:21:50.857
You are taking his side only.

01:21:51.857 --> 01:21:53.321
We will talk to him.

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:07.192
Listen..

01:22:12.192 --> 01:22:17.019
..this time please talk properly,
this is third time in past 6 months.

01:22:18.019 --> 01:22:20.999
I met Mrs Goyal in the morning
and even she was asking me..

01:22:20.999 --> 01:22:23.192
..if everything is alright.

01:22:24.192 --> 01:22:26.173
I will talk to Ravi ji.

01:22:30.173 --> 01:22:33.036
Sometime brings your
parents also along.

01:22:33.036 --> 01:22:35.987
Sure, they too remember you.

01:22:37.987 --> 01:22:40.079
What is this?
You haven't eaten anything.

01:22:42.079 --> 01:22:43.222
Have this.
- Yes.

01:22:54.222 --> 01:22:55.933
I am really apologetic
Father-in-law.

01:22:57.933 --> 01:23:01.531
I was wondering all the way
here as to how will I face you.

01:23:04.531 --> 01:23:06.811
You are aware small
fights keep happening.

01:23:08.811 --> 01:23:11.430
One utters something sometimes..

01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:14.700
but I shouldn't be taken seriously.

01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:18.103
That's true,
you are absolutely right.

01:23:19.103 --> 01:23:19.893
We understand.

01:23:21.893 --> 01:23:26.392
We think you must plan
to extend your family.

01:23:26.392 --> 01:23:30.580
Vani will also be busy and
these small fights would also end.

01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:34.272
That decision I
have left it on Vani..

01:23:35.272 --> 01:23:37.927
..whenever she is
ready only at that time.

01:23:47.927 --> 01:23:48.929
Shall we leave Vani?

01:23:50.929 --> 01:23:53.826
At least have something
to eat then we will leave.

01:23:54.826 --> 01:23:57.052
Is it important to leave today?

01:23:57.052 --> 01:24:00.219
Now that you have come,
at least stay back for a few days.

01:24:00.219 --> 01:24:01.860
Mummy, now I had
no choice but to come.

01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:05.628
Next time when I have a few days off
both Vani and I will come together.

01:24:59.628 --> 01:25:00.911
Aunt,  you?

01:25:06.911 --> 01:25:07.903
You seem to have forgotten us.

01:25:08.903 --> 01:25:10.687
Your mama was coming
here for some work..

01:25:10.687 --> 01:25:13.665
I too joined him
so that I can meet you.

01:25:15.665 --> 01:25:17.745
She is lying.
I asked her to come along.

01:25:19.745 --> 01:25:21.223
How are you?
- Greetings, aunty. -Hello.

01:25:21.223 --> 01:25:22.211
Enough.

01:25:22.211 --> 01:25:24.077
Hello, uncle.
- Have a long life!

01:25:26.077 --> 01:25:27.082
How are you?

01:25:27.082 --> 01:25:27.500
Very well.

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:30.724
And how are you doing?

01:25:31.724 --> 01:25:33.848
Very good. What about you?

01:25:34.848 --> 01:25:35.840
What can happen to me..

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:39.491
..you tell me what
about your MBA plans?

01:25:42.491 --> 01:25:45.103
Hope you are not planning
to start a family so soon.

01:25:45.103 --> 01:25:48.616
No. Ravi doesn't
think I need a MBA.

01:25:50.616 --> 01:25:53.747
He says I am earning
you simply enjoy.

01:25:58.747 --> 01:26:00.952
I hope you are coming
to Delhi for your Alumini meet.

01:26:01.952 --> 01:26:02.890
Suman said she told you.

01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:04.468
Yes.

01:26:05.468 --> 01:26:05.820
She had called.

01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:08.628
I don't think I can make it.

01:26:10.628 --> 01:26:13.129
Why? You should visit.

01:26:15.129 --> 01:26:17.317
No he won't understand..

01:26:17.317 --> 01:26:20.004
..and join me and if I go alone,
he won't like that either.

01:26:24.004 --> 01:26:28.710
Ravi, we were thinking if we
take Vani with us for a few days.

01:26:28.710 --> 01:26:30.027
Hope you don't mind.

01:26:31.027 --> 01:26:34.107
She has not visited
us after college.

01:26:34.107 --> 01:26:35.683
Why would I have a problem?

01:26:35.683 --> 01:26:38.372
She is your daughter,
you can take her along.

01:26:43.372 --> 01:26:46.942
Aunty, some other time.
Now there things to do at home..

01:26:46.942 --> 01:26:50.224
No some other time. Ravi has agreed,
anyways he was just sharing..

01:26:50.224 --> 01:26:52.483
..that he is going to
Hyderabad for a week in..

01:26:52.483 --> 01:26:54.115
..that case what
will you do here alone?

01:26:54.115 --> 01:26:55.468
You are coming with us,
that's decided.

01:26:56.468 --> 01:26:58.955
When Ravi returns
you too can return.

01:26:58.955 --> 01:27:00.085
Is it ok?

01:27:00.085 --> 01:27:00.775
I am fine with anything.

01:27:01.775 --> 01:27:02.852
It's settled.

01:27:08.852 --> 01:27:15.446
I have been very miserable, I cook,
clean utensils, wash clothes and..

01:27:18.446 --> 01:27:21.135
..then get tired and
have to wait for him..

01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:23.135
..till he uses me physically
for his pleasure..

01:27:23.135 --> 01:27:26.210
..and I don't even get paid for it.

01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:30.102
Why don't you just
leave the bastard?

01:27:31.102 --> 01:27:35.813
Get a divorce, come here, study for
MBA and just move on with your life.

01:27:35.813 --> 01:27:37.188
One daughter ran away..

01:27:39.188 --> 01:27:41.330
..and one will get divorced.

01:28:01.330 --> 01:28:02.820
Shall we go for shopping?

01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:06.054
Shopping?

01:28:07.054 --> 01:28:09.217
I want take you along
in these clothes.

01:28:19.217 --> 01:28:24.037
Those whose houses are
bright complain of darknessâ¦

01:28:27.037 --> 01:28:29.321
Such a boring evening!

01:28:30.321 --> 01:28:32.165
We shouldn't have come at all.

01:28:32.165 --> 01:28:35.085
It would have been better
to stay at home and get drunk.

01:28:35.085 --> 01:28:36.640
Wonderful..let's
hear something from you.

01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:42.376
The love that I once had,
has still stayed..

01:28:43.376 --> 01:28:46.450
The desire to be in shadow
of your hair has still stayed..

01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:50.021
My nights are still
full of dreams about you..

01:28:52.021 --> 01:28:54.813
This guy..just knows this one..

01:28:55.813 --> 01:28:57.687
And I am still crazy about you.

01:28:59.687 --> 01:29:01.554
My eyes can't even
picture anyone else..

01:29:02.554 --> 01:29:06.146
There is still some innocence
left in these treacherous eyes.

01:29:07.146 --> 01:29:09.198
I want your appreciation
on the following lines..

01:29:12.198 --> 01:29:12.765
Got your appreciation?

01:29:14.765 --> 01:29:16.401
As you loved me once,
you can once again leave me..

01:29:20.401 --> 01:29:22.964
As you loved me once,
you can once again leave me...

01:29:26.964 --> 01:29:30.111
Even now you have the permission
to break make my heart.

01:29:56.111 --> 01:29:59.258
Today we met as strangers..

01:30:02.258 --> 01:30:05.000
In vain I kept waiting..

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.098
With every look you are
going even more away from me.

01:30:19.098 --> 01:30:22.111
Like a cheat,
you have been avoiding me.

01:30:26.111 --> 01:30:30.915
In vain I kept waiting like a fool.

01:30:44.915 --> 01:30:45.860
Vani wait.

01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:46.550
I want to leave.

01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:48.898
Vani I will accompany you.
- No, I'll go.

01:30:49.898 --> 01:30:50.814
What happened?

01:30:58.814 --> 01:30:59.473
You felt bad?
- Aakash!

01:31:03.473 --> 01:31:05.168
Shouldn't I have
called you a cheat?

01:31:06.168 --> 01:31:07.707
Should I have called
you a victim instead?

01:31:07.707 --> 01:31:08.974
Aaksh stop.

01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:21.275
I am sorry Aakash.

01:31:23.275 --> 01:31:24.187
You are sorry!

01:31:26.187 --> 01:31:27.358
She is sorry!

01:31:29.358 --> 01:31:32.259
It's so easy isn't it?
To say I am sorry

01:31:33.259 --> 01:31:34.812
I am sorry that I
married someone else.

01:31:36.812 --> 01:31:40.305
I am sorry that without even meeting,
just over the phone I conveyed...

01:31:40.305 --> 01:31:42.135
..that you aren't
part of my life anymore.

01:31:44.135 --> 01:31:45.670
What else are you sorry about?

01:31:46.670 --> 01:31:49.303
Are you sorry that you
didn't invite me to your wedding?

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:49.736
Aakash please.

01:31:50.736 --> 01:31:52.952
Or that you didn't introduce
me to your husband?

01:31:53.952 --> 01:31:56.592
Or are you sorry about
the fact that you cheated me?

01:31:59.592 --> 01:32:02.381
Aakash let's go.

01:32:03.381 --> 01:32:08.034
I am sorry Vani, that I never loved
anyone as bad and as spineless as you.

01:32:14.034 --> 01:32:15.781
Vani! Vani!

01:32:19.781 --> 01:32:21.543
Vani, what is this childishness?
Go in the morning.

01:32:21.543 --> 01:32:22.425
What will we say to uncle, aunty?
- Anything.

01:32:23.425 --> 01:32:24.550
Will tell them my father called
but I just want to leave now.

01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:27.131
Vani..
- It's only my fault.

01:32:28.131 --> 01:32:29.437
I wanted to re-live the past.

01:32:31.437 --> 01:32:35.415
I had forgotten that some moments
in life are not to be remembered.

01:32:37.415 --> 01:32:38.893
With time these moments,
their meaningfulness..

01:32:38.893 --> 01:32:40.967
and importance, everything changes.

01:32:42.967 --> 01:32:43.693
Vani!

01:32:47.693 --> 01:32:51.535
Two years, I didn't even
allow myself to cry properly.

01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:58.749
She just made one phone
call and said everything is over!

01:32:59.749 --> 01:33:01.152
In one moment everything ended.

01:33:03.152 --> 01:33:05.950
All the dreams, promises,
rights were snatched from me..

01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:08.670
..and given to someone
else and she didn't even object!

01:33:11.670 --> 01:33:12.661
I tried a lot.

01:33:14.661 --> 01:33:16.220
I really tried a lot.

01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:19.394
I engrossed myself with
so much that I forget her.

01:33:21.394 --> 01:33:22.647
I stopped looking
at calendar so that..

01:33:23.647 --> 01:33:26.263
I don't even realise the
date when she is getting married.

01:33:28.263 --> 01:33:29.562
You know what I thought
when she was getting married..

01:33:32.562 --> 01:33:33.793
..how she must be looking.

01:33:37.793 --> 01:33:39.758
After that evening,
all other the evenings.

01:33:39.758 --> 01:33:41.902
I have had just this one thought,
this one thought...

01:33:41.902 --> 01:33:45.379
That it will be night and she would be
with her husband and they must beâ¦

01:33:49.379 --> 01:33:52.754
That place was mine and
it was given to someone else.

01:34:02.754 --> 01:34:07.380
It's ok. Whatever is happening
with her, she has made that choice.

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:08.919
It's out of her own weakness.

01:34:11.919 --> 01:34:15.829
Listen, If what is happening
to her is due to her own weakness..

01:34:16.829 --> 01:34:19.784
then in a way even you are responsible
for whatever that has happened to you.

01:34:20.784 --> 01:34:21.921
When she was weak, what did you do?

01:34:22.921 --> 01:34:25.585
You left her all by herself
because of your mad ego.

01:34:26.585 --> 01:34:28.670
When she said very easily
that relationship is over..

01:34:28.670 --> 01:34:30.264
..even you believed her easily.

01:34:32.264 --> 01:34:33.625
If she is responsible
for her miseries..

01:34:34.625 --> 01:34:36.610
..you have no right
to blame her for yours.

01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:39.892
You lost her because
you did not fight..

01:34:39.892 --> 01:34:41.906
..her parents whoever
that you needed to.

01:34:46.906 --> 01:34:51.348
Listen, whatever she did,
there was a reason behind it.

01:34:53.348 --> 01:34:59.326
Reasons are easier
said than believed.

01:35:11.326 --> 01:35:11.509
Yes say.

01:35:13.509 --> 01:35:13.802
What?

01:35:17.802 --> 01:35:18.515
Wait we are coming.

01:35:22.515 --> 01:35:23.754
What happened?

01:39:46.754 --> 01:39:47.795
Good morning!

01:39:48.795 --> 01:39:49.961
Good morning!

01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:02.567
Since when have you
been getting up so early?

01:40:05.567 --> 01:40:08.116
Since the time sleep
has deprived me.

01:40:24.116 --> 01:40:25.548
Delhi feels so pleasant
in this cold weather.

01:40:27.548 --> 01:40:29.397
Isn't it cold in Bangalore?

01:40:32.397 --> 01:40:36.285
Yes, it is but
not as much as Delhi.

01:40:41.285 --> 01:40:41.964
Tea?

01:40:43.964 --> 01:40:44.875
I will get it.

01:40:44.875 --> 01:40:47.289
No wait.
I had already made it.

01:41:02.289 --> 01:41:04.198
It's a little less, is it ok?

01:41:05.198 --> 01:41:05.870
Certainly.

01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:25.452
Every time I see this
cigarette in your hand..

01:41:28.452 --> 01:41:29.483
I feel I am responsible for it.

01:41:32.483 --> 01:41:34.125
Yes, you are right.

01:41:44.125 --> 01:41:47.387
Here, I will drop it.
It's just the matter of 2-3 days.

01:41:49.387 --> 01:41:50.751
And then you will start again?

01:41:56.751 --> 01:42:00.296
Please don't smoke again,
it's a bad habit.

01:42:06.296 --> 01:42:08.662
Are you laughing thinking what
right do I have in stopping you?

01:42:15.662 --> 01:42:17.075
Please don't smoke.

01:42:26.075 --> 01:42:26.613
Vani!

01:44:03.613 --> 01:44:05.184
What are you doing here?

01:44:09.184 --> 01:44:12.211
I am looking for that bulb.

01:44:26.211 --> 01:44:27.910
You never mentioned
about it to your parents?

01:44:30.910 --> 01:44:34.241
Yes I did, several times..

01:44:36.241 --> 01:44:41.531
..but until they see scars
on body they don't believe.

01:44:47.531 --> 01:44:48.906
Will you have fried bread?

01:44:51.906 --> 01:44:52.629
Let's go.

01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:56.506
You have gained weight.

01:44:57.506 --> 01:44:59.410
Yes, I have become
fat like an aunty.

01:45:01.410 --> 01:45:02.754
Put off the TV,
I want to show you all something.

01:45:03.754 --> 01:45:06.878
Come here, quickly.

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:19.987
What you keep roaming
everywhere with your camera?

01:45:19.987 --> 01:45:20.728
Don't bored.

01:45:27.728 --> 01:45:28.173
What?

01:45:29.173 --> 01:45:33.731
He was sleeping and he got
up and said he is still tired.

01:45:42.731 --> 01:45:45.607
What are you doing? Wait. Hold on.

01:45:54.607 --> 01:45:56.062
You were practically
dying of that freezing cold.

01:46:23.062 --> 01:46:23.661
Come on I am feeling sleepy.

01:46:24.661 --> 01:46:25.839
You too must sleep.

01:46:26.839 --> 01:46:27.906
Get up Vani, come.

01:46:28.906 --> 01:46:29.709
Come.

01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:34.862
Good Night.

01:46:34.862 --> 01:46:35.545
Good Night.

01:47:11.545 --> 01:47:12.936
Where are we going?

01:47:13.936 --> 01:47:15.129
Towards heaven.

01:47:34.129 --> 01:47:35.442
Have you gone mad?
People are watching, come down.

01:47:36.442 --> 01:47:38.325
It's been 8 days,
she hasn't kissed me.

01:47:39.325 --> 01:47:39.525
Lie, absolute lie.

01:47:40.525 --> 01:47:43.254
I kissed you 4 days
back in the library.

01:47:43.254 --> 01:47:48.367
4 days back! And it was a 3
second kiss. Does that even count?

01:47:48.367 --> 01:47:49.820
You are counting seconds!

01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:54.010
Go jump right away
I am not going to save you.

01:47:54.010 --> 01:47:55.286
Just watch I am jumping.
- Jump!

01:47:55.286 --> 01:47:56.929
Now, leave me. Let me jump.

01:47:56.929 --> 01:47:57.500
Leave or I'll jump.

01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:01.394
Let him come down and
then teach him a lesson.

01:48:19.394 --> 01:48:23.294
He is so mean;
he keeps hogging her all the time.

01:48:23.294 --> 01:48:24.909
How many grades do you want?

01:48:24.909 --> 01:48:25.420
Let me give you.

01:48:28.420 --> 01:48:29.174
One..

01:48:30.174 --> 01:48:31.258
Two..

01:48:31.258 --> 01:48:33.256
Give me also a few grades.

01:49:08.256 --> 01:49:09.687
Yahoo!!

01:49:11.687 --> 01:49:12.597
Yahoo!!

01:49:14.597 --> 01:49:16.517
Hurry!  Get up.

01:49:16.517 --> 01:49:17.139
I can't.

01:49:18.139 --> 01:49:20.808
Why can't you get up.

01:49:20.808 --> 01:49:23.150
I am not wearing a bra!

01:49:23.150 --> 01:49:23.856
So?

01:49:23.856 --> 01:49:25.043
So it will show!

01:49:26.043 --> 01:49:26.903
What will show?

01:49:31.903 --> 01:49:33.147
Don't you dare!

01:49:35.147 --> 01:49:35.496
You also want one?

01:49:37.496 --> 01:49:38.497
Shekhu!

01:49:45.497 --> 01:49:47.152
Where are we going?

01:49:47.152 --> 01:49:47.461
What do I know.

01:49:48.461 --> 01:49:50.015
What do you mean
that you don't know!

01:49:50.015 --> 01:49:51.522
Means how do I know.

01:49:52.522 --> 01:49:52.590
Shekhar..

01:49:54.590 --> 01:49:56.602
What! don't look at me,
I don't know anything.

01:49:57.602 --> 01:49:59.700
How does it matter,
where we are going!

01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:00.660
We are going to Chandigarh.

01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:03.817
Chandigarh. No.

01:50:03.817 --> 01:50:04.697
Shut up, let's have fun!

01:50:05.697 --> 01:50:07.143
Don't be an aunty! Aunty!!

01:50:08.143 --> 01:50:09.173
Take turn back.

01:50:10.173 --> 01:50:12.219
I told you don't be like aunty.

01:50:13.219 --> 01:50:15.352
I want to go to the loo.

01:50:15.352 --> 01:50:16.750
Why do you have to
go home to go to the loo?

01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:18.789
C'mon find some bushes and do it.

01:50:21.789 --> 01:50:22.866
I want to do potty..

01:50:23.866 --> 01:50:26.934
Oh so say that way.

01:50:35.934 --> 01:50:36.964
What are we doing here?

01:50:38.964 --> 01:50:39.460
I want her back!

01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:42.816
Do you know what you are saying?

01:50:45.816 --> 01:50:47.217
Is she happy?

01:50:49.217 --> 01:50:51.599
If she would have been happy, I would
have been sad that she is not with me.

01:50:52.599 --> 01:50:54.655
But at least I would have
been relieved that she is happy.

01:50:56.655 --> 01:50:59.334
I feel she thinks,
she has no right to be happy.

01:51:00.334 --> 01:51:01.594
I just want her
to be happy for once.

01:51:02.594 --> 01:51:04.272
Ok. Then?

01:51:06.272 --> 01:51:09.089
Then when she returns,
she will miss this happiness..

01:51:10.089 --> 01:51:11.468
..and it will prick her..

01:51:12.468 --> 01:51:14.701
and with that she would
be able to stand up for herself.

01:51:15.701 --> 01:51:16.733
And what if this doesn't happen?

01:51:23.733 --> 01:51:24.504
Are you feeling light now?

01:51:26.504 --> 01:51:28.731
Do you want to go to
Chandigarh dressed like this?

01:51:28.731 --> 01:51:30.223
C'mon let's shop.

01:54:02.223 --> 01:54:06.277
"Somebody pushed me
at night and now it is day."

01:54:07.277 --> 01:54:11.345
"I have made the dew
drops also come my way."

01:54:12.345 --> 01:54:16.433
"Somebody pushed me
at night and now it is day."

01:54:17.433 --> 01:54:21.353
"I have made the dew
drops also come my way."

01:54:22.353 --> 01:54:26.558
"We have started that
which was left mid way."

01:54:27.558 --> 01:54:31.875
"And now the paths are
also smiling when we walk."

01:54:33.875 --> 01:54:35.880
"Just me and you."

01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:40.977
"Just me and you."

01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:46.366
"Just me and you."

01:55:11.366 --> 01:55:12.326
Tea?

01:55:13.326 --> 01:55:13.722
I'll make it.

01:55:14.722 --> 01:55:18.259
No let's have it someplace else.

01:55:21.259 --> 01:55:23.183
Just the both of us.

01:55:34.183 --> 01:55:35.678
This morning is
so beautiful isn't it?

01:55:36.678 --> 01:55:36.777
Yes.

01:55:38.777 --> 01:55:41.262
Every morning here
must be as beautiful.

01:55:42.262 --> 01:55:44.090
No..

01:55:45.090 --> 01:55:45.723
..it is only when you are awake..

01:55:47.723 --> 01:55:49.501
..and have someone special
to share that with you.

01:56:03.501 --> 01:56:04.732
Give us 2 cups tea and biscuits.

01:56:05.732 --> 01:56:06.914
Yes, sure.

01:56:08.914 --> 01:56:10.759
Are you both on your
honeymoon as well?

01:56:15.759 --> 01:56:16.713
No.

01:56:25.713 --> 01:56:35.040
"Let's not think about
the past or future."

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:45.125
"Let's enjoy without any
inhibitions this present moment."

01:56:46.125 --> 01:56:51.213
"Let's make most of this times,
steal drops from this rain."

01:56:51.213 --> 01:56:55.839
"Let's not think of
others and walk together."

01:56:57.839 --> 01:56:58.897
"Just you and me."

01:57:02.897 --> 01:57:03.921
"Just you and me."

01:57:07.921 --> 01:57:10.006
"Just you and me."

01:57:43.006 --> 01:57:47.988
"Let's fly kites on moon"

01:57:47.988 --> 01:57:51.977
"And snatch stars from the sky"

01:57:52.977 --> 01:57:58.062
"Let's fly kites on moon"

01:57:58.062 --> 01:58:02.177
"And snatch stars from the sky"

01:58:03.177 --> 01:58:05.780
"Hold the mouthful
of sky in your palm,"

01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:07.661
"And let fears escape you quickly."

01:58:07.661 --> 01:58:12.575
"Walk with me in the
way that you never left me."

01:58:14.575 --> 01:58:15.643
"Once again the both of us."

01:58:19.643 --> 01:58:20.612
"Just you and me."

01:58:24.612 --> 01:58:29.876
"Just you and me."

02:00:46.876 --> 02:00:50.780
"I do not wish for anything."

02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:56.004
"Nor will I listen to anyone."

02:00:57.004 --> 02:01:00.924
"You are happy and I am with you."

02:01:01.924 --> 02:01:05.401
"I just know this one thing."

02:01:07.401 --> 02:01:11.424
"Once you stretch your hand,
I will hold it with mine."

02:01:12.424 --> 02:01:15.827
"Come, lets go ahead together."

02:01:18.827 --> 02:01:19.805
"Now, Just me and you."

02:01:23.805 --> 02:01:25.865
"Now, Just me and you."

02:01:28.865 --> 02:01:31.009
"Now, Just me and you."

02:01:39.009 --> 02:01:40.296
"Now, Just me and you."

02:02:01.296 --> 02:02:02.418
I want to count.

02:02:03.418 --> 02:02:04.786
Let me count.
- No.

02:02:14.786 --> 02:02:19.321
You know no matter how dark the night
is there is always a bright morning.

02:02:20.321 --> 02:02:22.027
I don't know when
the sun would rise..

02:02:23.027 --> 02:02:23.991
but you can bring light..

02:02:26.991 --> 02:02:28.661
..with these fire flies as well.

02:02:39.661 --> 02:02:42.396
Hi! Look.

02:02:50.396 --> 02:02:51.531
Uncle has called..

02:02:55.531 --> 02:02:56.522
..and asked you
to come to Dehradun.

02:03:22.522 --> 02:03:22.889
Vani..

02:03:27.889 --> 02:03:30.068
..it was indeed very
beautiful this morning..

02:03:33.068 --> 02:03:37.387
..and if you wish every
morning can be like it.

02:03:49.387 --> 02:03:50.670
Some dreams are so beautiful..

02:03:52.670 --> 02:03:59.156
..that even after being
awake we wish to close our eyes..

02:04:00.156 --> 02:04:01.595
and start from where we left off.

02:04:04.595 --> 02:04:06.295
But does it happen that way?

02:07:27.295 --> 02:07:32.273
You had told me I had left
her alone, but not this time.

02:08:21.273 --> 02:08:24.637
Don't be too happy,
I haven't come here for you.

02:08:27.637 --> 02:08:30.558
Previously too I wanted
to come but couldn't.

02:08:32.558 --> 02:08:34.411
But this could be my only chance.

02:08:42.411 --> 02:08:42.555
Come.

02:08:54.555 --> 02:08:55.719
Child, do you want to sit and eat.

02:08:55.719 --> 02:08:57.089
No I am eating with aunty.

02:08:57.089 --> 02:08:57.741
Okay.

02:09:02.741 --> 02:09:03.482
I will check. - No you
remain seated, let me check.

02:09:10.482 --> 02:09:11.888
Oh Ravi ji.

02:09:12.888 --> 02:09:15.251
Hello!
- Hello! Long live!

02:09:15.251 --> 02:09:17.044
Weren't you going to come tomorrow?

02:09:17.044 --> 02:09:20.296
Yes, but my office work got completed
sooner so I decided to come early.

02:09:22.296 --> 02:09:24.320
Sudha! Ravi ji has come.

02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:31.018
You have come just at the right time.
- Greetings!

02:09:31.018 --> 02:09:32.235
Be happy.

02:09:32.235 --> 02:09:32.929
Please sit.

02:09:47.929 --> 02:09:49.463
These are Vani's college
friends Aakash and Shekhar.

02:09:54.463 --> 02:09:55.929
Vani, please get me some water.

02:09:57.929 --> 02:09:59.211
Here, grab a plate.
- Yes.

02:10:22.211 --> 02:10:23.866
Vani, serve it.

02:10:41.866 --> 02:10:42.558
Sleep now.

02:10:44.558 --> 02:10:45.867
Good night.

02:12:02.867 --> 02:12:04.839
Vani, Come here.

02:12:56.839 --> 02:12:57.563
Vani!

02:12:59.563 --> 02:13:01.226
Don't you want to sleep.

02:13:13.226 --> 02:13:14.068
Vani!

02:13:20.068 --> 02:13:21.232
What happened?

02:13:23.232 --> 02:13:24.036
What happened?

02:13:25.036 --> 02:13:25.856
Papa I..

02:13:27.856 --> 02:13:29.034
What happened?

02:13:32.034 --> 02:13:33.080
Ravi ji..

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:34.122
Papa..

02:13:38.122 --> 02:13:39.546
I can't stay with Ravi.

02:13:40.546 --> 02:13:42.133
What do you mean?

02:13:42.133 --> 02:13:42.485
I want a divorce.

02:13:45.485 --> 02:13:46.280
What!

02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:50.205
What rubbish are you talking about?

02:13:51.205 --> 02:13:52.674
What are you afraid of?

02:13:54.674 --> 02:13:55.457
That what will people say?

02:13:58.457 --> 02:13:59.781
What if this was
happening with sister?

02:14:01.781 --> 02:14:03.388
If her marriage was falling apart..

02:14:05.388 --> 02:14:07.335
You would have been happy..

02:14:08.335 --> 02:14:10.312
..and felt let her pay
for whatever she has done.

02:14:11.312 --> 02:14:12.880
As that mistake was made by her.

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:18.187
And this is your mistake, so
why do you want me to compromise?

02:14:20.187 --> 02:14:21.490
Only because this mistake
has been made by you..

02:14:22.490 --> 02:14:23.450
..do you want me to pay
for it throughout my life?

02:14:24.450 --> 02:14:26.976
But my dear, we have always
thought in your best interest.

02:14:26.976 --> 02:14:30.715
And even now we are doing the same.
- Lie, Absolute lie.

02:14:31.715 --> 02:14:33.870
You are not saying
this in my best interest..

02:14:33.870 --> 02:14:36.401
..but to protect your
pride in the society.

02:14:40.401 --> 02:14:42.205
I am not saying that
parents should have no right..

02:14:42.205 --> 02:14:43.464
..in choosing partner
for their children..

02:14:45.464 --> 02:14:49.799
But if children are unhappy, shouldn't
parents own up to the responsibility?

02:14:53.799 --> 02:14:56.210
Today, I just want to
ask this one thing to you..

02:14:56.210 --> 02:14:57.656
That why when a daughter
tells her father..

02:14:58.656 --> 02:15:01.366
...that the partner they
have chosen for her is not right.

02:15:02.366 --> 02:15:03.433
Why then is she told to compromise?

02:15:05.433 --> 02:15:07.646
And assured falsely that
everything will be fine.

02:15:07.646 --> 02:15:09.182
And when the same mistake...

02:15:09.182 --> 02:15:11.689
..is committed by a daughter
in choosing a wrong partner..

02:15:12.689 --> 02:15:15.255
She is mocked and asked
to pay for her own mistake.

02:15:18.255 --> 02:15:19.986
But what is that which
is lacking in your life?

02:15:21.986 --> 02:15:24.362
This is a common
thing in all households.

02:15:25.362 --> 02:15:26.959
Just once you start a family..

02:15:26.959 --> 02:15:32.253
Why can't you understand that starting
a family is not the solution?

02:15:33.253 --> 02:15:34.584
I would be even more trapped then.

02:15:37.584 --> 02:15:40.223
When I can't stand the person..

02:15:40.223 --> 02:15:43.178
..how can I even thinking
of starting a family with him?

02:15:47.178 --> 02:15:50.117
If in every house
the wife is raped..

02:15:52.117 --> 02:15:53.540
..then I don't want
to live in such a house.

02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:07.869
If more than my happiness,
you are bothered about..

02:16:08.869 --> 02:16:15.844
what the society would think and
how they would perceive, then No.

02:16:17.844 --> 02:16:20.023
I am not prepared to bear
the consequences of your mistake.

02:16:21.023 --> 02:16:25.851
No matter whose mistake
it is in life and however big..

02:16:25.851 --> 02:16:27.859
..one shouldn't be
stopped from living.

02:16:30.859 --> 02:16:31.501
Papa, why are you quiet?

02:16:32.501 --> 02:16:34.379
In your respect,
I am not saying anything.

02:16:34.379 --> 02:16:37.174
But my own wife, who is my pride..

02:16:37.174 --> 02:16:38.691
..is tarnishing my pride
in front of everyone.

02:16:38.691 --> 02:16:40.263
Which pride are you talking about?

02:16:40.263 --> 02:16:43.755
The one that you rape every night..
or the one that you can't even protect

02:16:43.755 --> 02:16:46.246
if someone tries to
molest during the day.

02:16:46.246 --> 02:16:48.565
I have been bearing this Papa,
only respecting you but you know..

02:16:49.565 --> 02:16:50.761
But it's too much.

02:16:50.761 --> 02:16:53.606
I didn't want to do this but
now only I have to set this right.

02:17:34.606 --> 02:17:37.303
Oh so this is the real reason!

02:17:38.303 --> 02:17:45.228
This is the real reason
and I am being blamed in vain.

02:17:46.228 --> 02:17:50.585
It's only my mistake that I associated
myself with such a disreputed family.

02:17:55.585 --> 02:18:00.320
Did you see, because of
you what did we have to hear?

02:18:09.320 --> 02:18:14.258
If only I could to tell you that
because of you what I had to bear!

02:18:27.258 --> 02:18:42.598
"Ours is a flock of sparrows,
dear father, We'll fly away"

02:18:45.598 --> 02:19:02.564
"On a long, long flight, We know
not to which land we shall go."

02:19:04.564 --> 02:19:14.585
"Ours is a flock of sparrows"

02:20:04.586 --> 02:20:06.062
What are you thinking?

02:20:09.062 --> 02:20:10.779
I wish at least my mother
would have understood me.

02:20:13.779 --> 02:20:17.588
She will understand
but it will take some time.

02:20:25.588 --> 02:20:26.949
I just wanted you to know..

02:20:28.949 --> 02:20:31.358
..that whatever I have done,
I have done it for myself.

02:20:34.358 --> 02:20:35.884
I don't want you to feelâ¦

02:20:38.884 --> 02:20:40.660
I am glad that you have
done this for yourself.

02:20:47.660 --> 02:20:49.727
That doesn't mean that
I am in love with you.

02:20:50.727 --> 02:20:52.258
I also don't love you..

02:20:58.258 --> 02:21:01.200
Akaash,
Vani the breakfast is ready.

02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:02.735
C'mon!

02:21:04.735 --> 02:21:06.022
Listen!

02:21:09.022 --> 02:21:10.290
I love you.

02:21:40.290 --> 02:21:47.339
C'mon go to your own house and from
next month start paying for groceries.

02:21:47.339 --> 02:21:49.595
Where will we go
in the middle of night?

02:21:49.595 --> 02:21:51.506
Go, go c'mon leave.

02:23:19.506 --> 02:23:24.510
"You are poetry of romantic eyes."

02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:32.590
"You are carefree,
pitiless and treacherous."

02:23:34.590 --> 02:23:40.502
"You are poetry of romantic eyes."

02:23:42.502 --> 02:23:48.635
"You are carefree,
pitiless and treacherous."

02:23:50.635 --> 02:23:58.655
"You are the one waving with
attitude from earth to the sky."

02:23:58.655 --> 02:24:08.490
"That is swimming across the clouds.
That is sharp and unabashed."

02:24:09.490 --> 02:24:15.349
You are the mad
and fun filled kite.

02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:25.575
"You are poetry of romantic eyes."

02:24:29.575 --> 02:24:32.761
"You are carefree,
pitiless and treacherous."

02:24:32.761 --> 02:24:40.760
"You are the one waving with
attitude from earth to the sky."

02:24:40.760 --> 02:24:48.484
"That is swimming across the clouds.
That is sharp and unabashed."

02:24:49.484 --> 02:24:54.734
You are the mad
and fun filled kite.

02:24:56.734 --> 02:25:03.125
"You are.. Yes, you are."

02:25:04.125 --> 02:25:07.400
"Yes, you are."
