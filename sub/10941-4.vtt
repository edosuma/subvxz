<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.800 --> 00:02.733
Ty.

00:04.870 --> 00:05.736
Why don't you get
your butt home

00:05.804 --> 00:07.038
where you belong?!

00:07.106 --> 00:08.872
Don't you tell me
where my butt belongs!

00:08.940 --> 00:10.107
Glad to hear that,
for the most part,

00:10.175 --> 00:12.809
<i>the kids were well-behaved.</i>

00:12.877 --> 00:14.511
<i>Her date is really cute
and really rich.</i>

00:14.579 --> 00:16.113
He goes to some private school.

00:16.213 --> 00:17.247
Frat boy.

00:17.315 --> 00:19.416
Are you ready to go?

00:21.186 --> 00:23.853
<i>It's already had
almost 3000 hits.</i>

00:23.921 --> 00:25.421
You're famous.

00:25.489 --> 00:27.223
I didn't ask
for this to happen.

00:27.291 --> 00:28.558
Of all the people I know,

00:28.625 --> 00:31.060
you're more than capable
of dealin'.

00:54.350 --> 00:56.183
I don't think you should go
in there.

00:56.251 --> 00:57.585
Mallory,
I just have to go

00:57.652 --> 00:59.320
take a look
at Mr. Hanley's horses.

00:59.387 --> 01:00.488
What about...

01:00.555 --> 01:01.855
You know, what they say
about this place?

01:01.923 --> 01:05.092
What, all those stupid
ghost stories?

01:05.160 --> 01:06.994
Don't worry about it, okay?
I'll be right back.

01:07.061 --> 01:09.597
Amy! Have you ever seen
a scary movie?

01:09.664 --> 01:11.765
You are never supposed to say
"I'll be right back."

01:11.833 --> 01:13.099
People who say
"I'll be right back"

01:13.167 --> 01:14.700
never come back.

01:14.768 --> 01:16.269
I'll be right back.

01:34.086 --> 01:35.053
Hello?

01:38.625 --> 01:40.359
Hello?

01:40.426 --> 01:41.760
Mr. Hanley?

01:41.827 --> 01:44.428
Miss Fleming,
I've been watching you.

01:44.496 --> 01:45.396
Oh.

01:45.464 --> 01:47.365
On the Internet.

01:47.432 --> 01:49.867
I saw you save that horse.

01:49.934 --> 01:51.135
Very impressive.

01:51.203 --> 01:52.102
Thank you.

01:52.171 --> 01:53.171
I'm glad you came.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.104
You see,
there's something very wrong

01:54.173 --> 01:57.275
with the horses.

01:57.342 --> 01:59.210
What seems to be
the problem?

02:03.981 --> 02:05.482
By morning the horses
are so worked up

02:05.550 --> 02:06.483
no one can ride 'em.

02:06.551 --> 02:08.050
I've already lost
four boarders,

02:08.118 --> 02:11.254
and I can't afford
to lose any more.

02:11.322 --> 02:12.922
Do you think
you can help me?

02:12.990 --> 02:14.391
Well, um...

02:15.759 --> 02:16.858
I'll see what I can do.

02:16.926 --> 02:18.561
But it could be
a range of issues.

02:18.628 --> 02:20.028
I'll leave you to it,
then.

02:21.565 --> 02:23.098
Uh, Mr. Hanley,
I...

02:27.770 --> 02:29.438
Um...

02:29.506 --> 02:32.773
I can't stay,
but I'll come back tomorrow.

02:38.847 --> 02:41.416
Um... Mr. Hanley?

02:42.784 --> 02:44.385
Is that you?

02:54.696 --> 02:56.930
Ahh! Mallory!

02:56.997 --> 02:57.897
You scared me!

02:57.965 --> 02:59.533
I scared you?!

02:59.601 --> 03:00.767
Can we go now?

03:00.835 --> 03:02.302
We were supposed to meet Ty
like 10 minutes ago.

03:02.370 --> 03:05.003
Plus, this place is giving me
the serious creeps.

03:05.071 --> 03:06.639
Yeah. Let's go.

03:07.841 --> 03:10.142
<i>I heard he lost his mind,</i>

03:10.210 --> 03:12.578
<i>so he murdered his wife.</i>

03:12.646 --> 03:16.782
And her body is hidden upstairs
in the loft.

03:16.850 --> 03:18.884
Okay, guys, Mr. Hanley
might be a bit eccentric,

03:18.952 --> 03:20.619
but he's definitely
not a murderer.

03:20.686 --> 03:22.420
Whoa. Who's Mr. Hanley?

03:22.488 --> 03:24.188
Who's Mr. Hanley?
Are you serious?

03:24.257 --> 03:25.357
Mr. Hanley's barn

03:25.424 --> 03:27.859
is Hudson's favourite
ghost story.

03:27.926 --> 03:30.462
It's practically campfire 101
in these parts.

03:30.529 --> 03:33.131
See, the original barn
burnt down in the 1940's.

03:33.198 --> 03:34.432
And there used to be
a stable hand

03:34.500 --> 03:35.600
that worked there.

03:35.668 --> 03:37.167
He was supposedly
homeless

03:37.235 --> 03:38.769
and drifted from town
to town...

03:38.836 --> 03:40.804
But this job
would be his last

03:40.872 --> 03:43.106
'cause one night
when he was fast asleep,

03:43.174 --> 03:44.575
the barn burnt
to the ground.

03:44.643 --> 03:47.778
And not only did
all the horses die,

03:47.845 --> 03:50.013
but so did
the stable hand.

03:50.081 --> 03:51.715
<i>And then a few years
after the fire,</i>

03:51.783 --> 03:53.983
Mr. Hanley's family
moved into the farm.

03:54.050 --> 03:55.851
And well,
they built a new barn

03:55.919 --> 03:58.788
on the exact same spot
where the old one stood.

03:58.855 --> 03:59.955
And let me guess,
it's now haunted

04:00.023 --> 04:01.457
by the ghost
of the stable hand.

04:01.525 --> 04:03.593
That's right.
They call him the drifter.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.161
He wears a long
black coat.

04:05.228 --> 04:06.696
But if you take
the hood down,

04:06.764 --> 04:09.564
he has no face
because it burnt right off.

04:09.632 --> 04:10.932
<i>Ok,  Mallory,</i>

04:11.000 --> 04:12.367
<i>no one really believes
that story, okay?</i>

04:12.435 --> 04:14.269
At least, no one
in their right mind.

04:22.111 --> 04:23.645
Woo!

04:23.713 --> 04:26.314
<i>That's some real bad weather
blowin' in.</i>

05:12.758 --> 05:13.958
I can't thank you enough

05:14.025 --> 05:16.060
for letting me use
your kitchen.

05:16.127 --> 05:18.595
It's no problem,
so long as we get a jar

05:18.663 --> 05:20.231
of that famous jam
of yours.

05:20.298 --> 05:22.933
I'll make sure you get
the best of the batch.

05:23.001 --> 05:23.934
Lou, here,
she'll be happy

05:24.002 --> 05:25.102
to help you out
with the canning.

05:25.170 --> 05:26.570
I will?

05:26.637 --> 05:28.739
That is so nice of you,
dear.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.673
It'll be so much fun

05:30.741 --> 05:32.608
to spend the whole day
together.

05:32.676 --> 05:33.676
The whole day?

05:33.744 --> 05:36.412
Aren't you coming inside,
Mrs. Bell?

05:36.480 --> 05:37.546
Oh, no,
I've gotta go

05:37.614 --> 05:39.282
get the rest
of the strawberries.

05:39.350 --> 05:40.250
There's more?

05:40.317 --> 05:41.517
Oh yes, dear.

05:41.585 --> 05:43.419
And by the time
the strawberries are done,

05:43.487 --> 05:45.754
the saskatoons will be ripe
for the picking.

05:45.821 --> 05:46.955
Come on.
Y'ah, y'ah.

05:47.023 --> 05:49.324
Thanks again, Jack!

05:49.392 --> 05:51.393
Yeah.
Thanks, Jack.

05:51.460 --> 05:52.427
Thanks.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.870
Hey, Ty.

06:02.938 --> 06:04.138
Badger?

06:04.206 --> 06:05.873
You know these apples
are rotten, right?

06:05.941 --> 06:06.807
That's because
they're for the horses.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.409
What're you doing here?

06:08.476 --> 06:09.743
What? No hug?

06:24.091 --> 06:25.892
Hey, boy.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.227
You're okay.

06:30.298 --> 06:32.965
It's all right.
It's probably just a squirrel.

06:38.371 --> 06:41.206
A really big squirrel...
wearing chains.

06:47.613 --> 06:50.581
It's okay.
It's just the wind.

06:51.883 --> 06:54.419
So, I arrive in Denver
at eleven.

06:55.821 --> 06:58.656
We'll just meet
at the gate, right?

06:58.723 --> 07:01.960
No, no plans this time.

07:03.528 --> 07:06.563
Yeah.
Just the whole day together.

07:06.630 --> 07:08.465
All right,
I can't wait to see you.

07:08.532 --> 07:09.499
Bye.

07:09.567 --> 07:10.667
Denver?

07:10.734 --> 07:11.634
Yeah.

07:11.702 --> 07:13.070
Colorado?

07:13.137 --> 07:16.773
Yes. Peter's been travelling
a lot lately for work,

07:16.841 --> 07:17.975
and he has a layover
in Denver,

07:18.042 --> 07:19.709
so we're going to spend
the day together

07:19.777 --> 07:21.677
before he flies off
to Louisiana.

07:21.744 --> 07:23.846
Doesn't that seem like
an awful long way to go

07:23.913 --> 07:25.214
just to spend the day.

07:25.282 --> 07:26.949
Actually,
I'm looking forward to it.

07:27.017 --> 07:29.852
Well... you be careful.

07:29.919 --> 07:31.954
"Be careful"
as in wear sunscreen?

07:32.022 --> 07:33.356
Or "be careful"
as in you don't approve

07:33.423 --> 07:34.823
of cross-border dating?

07:34.891 --> 07:38.360
I just mean that Denver's
an awful long way away

07:38.427 --> 07:41.162
and I want you
to be careful.

07:46.068 --> 07:47.702
Does Clint know you're here?

07:47.769 --> 07:50.505
Yeah, he dropped me off.
Told me to have a good time.

07:50.572 --> 07:52.807
So you ran away?

07:52.875 --> 07:54.708
Um...
More of a vacation.

07:54.775 --> 07:55.842
Do you have any idea

07:55.910 --> 07:56.676
what they do to kids
on probation

07:56.744 --> 07:58.045
who run away?

07:58.113 --> 08:00.614
Hey, I'm talking to you,
man!

08:00.681 --> 08:02.082
You think
your group home's bad?

08:02.150 --> 08:04.518
Wait 'til you see
what they lock you up in now.

08:04.585 --> 08:07.221
So call Clint.
What're you waiting for?

08:07.288 --> 08:08.355
If you don't drop
that attitude, man,

08:08.423 --> 08:10.123
that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

08:10.190 --> 08:13.393
You know, it must be nice...
Being all superior.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.562
Like you've got everything
figured out.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.431
I think I liked you better
when you didn't talk.

08:18.532 --> 08:19.765
Wait, Ty.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.136
I just need a place
to spend the night.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.971
After that,
if you want,

08:27.040 --> 08:29.341
you'll never hear from me
again.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.442
Just...

08:32.245 --> 08:34.645
Just please
don't tell anyone.

08:42.787 --> 08:44.321
It's okay... it's okay.

08:44.389 --> 08:45.589
Hey.

08:45.657 --> 08:48.292
I know, I wouldn't wanna go
in there either.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.927
<i>Come on, Levon.</i>

08:49.994 --> 08:51.194
<i>You know as well as I do,</i>

08:51.262 --> 08:52.962
<i>nobody's gonna make you
a better offer.</i>

08:53.030 --> 08:54.531
Why wait for the bank
to foreclose

08:54.598 --> 08:55.932
when you could sell it to me
right now?

08:55.999 --> 08:57.867
You get off my property.

08:57.935 --> 08:59.235
No need to get hostile.

08:59.303 --> 09:01.271
Just trying to be
a good neighbour.

09:01.338 --> 09:02.772
Leave.

09:02.839 --> 09:04.941
<i>You have yourself a good day.</i>

09:11.981 --> 09:13.982
Any luck with the horses?

09:14.050 --> 09:15.084
Um...

09:15.452 --> 09:18.387
Well, these things,
they do take time.

09:18.455 --> 09:20.021
The horses, they seem...

09:20.090 --> 09:22.257
I don't know,
spooked.

09:22.325 --> 09:23.724
Look, I know people talk
about this place.

09:23.792 --> 09:24.959
I've heard the stories.

09:25.026 --> 09:26.660
But this is my home.

09:26.728 --> 09:28.929
And I need people to board
their horses here

09:28.997 --> 09:30.965
<i>or I'm gonna lose it.</i>

09:31.032 --> 09:32.666
So I need you
to let me know

09:32.734 --> 09:34.034
there's some kind
of hope here.

09:34.103 --> 09:36.704
Some kind of rational
explanation for all this.

09:36.771 --> 09:38.406
I'm gonna do everything
I can.

09:38.474 --> 09:39.772
I promise.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.883
Badger,
is that you?

09:50.951 --> 09:52.419
Mallory?

09:52.487 --> 09:53.420
Hey.

09:55.655 --> 09:57.723
Wow. You look so...

09:59.426 --> 10:00.359
What're you doing?

10:00.427 --> 10:02.294
Oh, just messing around.

10:02.362 --> 10:03.529
You're an artist?

10:03.597 --> 10:04.530
No, I suck.

10:05.665 --> 10:06.932
Can I see?

10:09.503 --> 10:10.369
It's, ah...

10:12.338 --> 10:14.372
It's not very good.

10:16.242 --> 10:17.142
You're right,
it's not very good.

10:17.209 --> 10:18.510
It's incredible.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.078
You think so?

10:21.147 --> 10:22.580
Yeah, I do.

10:23.815 --> 10:25.683
So, how's Tara?

10:25.784 --> 10:27.551
Who?

10:27.619 --> 10:28.952
Tara, the girl you were...

10:29.020 --> 10:30.287
Oh. Uh...

10:31.389 --> 10:33.089
I don't know.

10:33.158 --> 10:35.459
I mean, I haven't seen her
for a little while.

10:36.561 --> 10:37.494
Oh.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.432
Great.

10:46.336 --> 10:48.103
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

10:49.105 --> 10:50.506
Ty ratted me out.

10:59.049 --> 11:01.783
Clint.
What brings you all the way up here?

11:01.850 --> 11:04.352
Hope you're not checking up
on me.

11:04.420 --> 11:05.920
Badger ran away
and I had a hunch

11:05.988 --> 11:07.955
he might be headed out
this way.

11:08.023 --> 11:09.691
Really?

11:09.758 --> 11:12.760
Ty, if he's here,
I gotta know.

11:12.828 --> 11:13.928
It's for his own good.

11:13.996 --> 11:14.929
I can't help the boy

11:14.997 --> 11:17.364
if I don't know
where he is.

11:18.233 --> 11:20.467
Um, he was here.

11:20.535 --> 11:21.935
He actually just left.

11:22.003 --> 11:25.739
Said something about hitchhiking
to the bus station.

11:26.908 --> 11:28.709
He couldn't have
gotten far.

11:28.776 --> 11:30.911
I'll come with you.

11:36.483 --> 11:37.617
<i>Oh, hey.</i>

11:37.685 --> 11:39.719
Mallory,
you're just in time.

11:39.786 --> 11:40.886
<i>Grab a ladle,</i>

11:40.954 --> 11:42.021
Mrs. Bell could really
use your help

11:42.089 --> 11:43.323
with this canning.

11:43.390 --> 11:44.424
No can do.

11:44.491 --> 11:47.026
I got places to go
and horses to ride.

11:47.094 --> 11:48.560
Hey, Mrs. Bell.

11:48.628 --> 11:50.161
Hello, dear.

11:50.230 --> 11:52.163
Mallory, come on,
help me out.

11:52.232 --> 11:53.599
If I have to hear
one more story about Sugarfoot,

11:53.666 --> 11:54.799
I'm gonna get diabetes.

11:54.867 --> 11:55.900
No.

11:55.968 --> 11:56.935
Mallory!

12:00.240 --> 12:03.374
Just like a teenager,
eat you out of house and home.

12:03.442 --> 12:04.609
Yeah.

12:04.676 --> 12:07.177
Reminds me of my Sugarfoot.

12:07.246 --> 12:08.479
<i>Did I ever tell you
about the time</i>

12:08.547 --> 12:10.748
he got his head caught
in the refrigerator?

12:10.815 --> 12:13.183
No. But I can't wait to hear
all about it.

12:13.252 --> 12:14.652
Mrs. Bell: It all started
when he found out...

12:14.720 --> 12:16.287
Every excruciating detail.

12:17.772 --> 12:18.706
Hey.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.008
I got you...

12:23.043 --> 12:23.977
water,

12:25.012 --> 12:26.345
yogurt,

12:26.413 --> 12:28.214
and a pack of...

12:29.316 --> 12:30.650
sour cream.

12:30.718 --> 12:33.319
Uh, sorry.
I guess I panicked.

12:33.387 --> 12:35.554
Thanks, Mallory.
You're awesome.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.993
So, where are you gonna go?

12:42.328 --> 12:44.262
I don't know yet.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.832
But...
wherever I end up?

12:47.634 --> 12:49.300
I hope there's a really big
baked potato.

12:53.438 --> 12:55.840
Am I ever gonna
see you again?

12:57.509 --> 12:58.976
Count on it.

13:21.265 --> 13:23.266
<i>Looking for something,
miss Fleming?</i>

13:23.333 --> 13:25.634
Um...

13:25.702 --> 13:27.469
Actually, I was just looking
for you.

13:27.537 --> 13:29.738
I was thinking...

13:29.806 --> 13:31.974
<i>You know, the horses
seem worked up at night,</i>

13:32.042 --> 13:34.176
it might be because they're
eating too many carbohydrates.

13:34.243 --> 13:35.510
I've already been through this
with the vet.

13:35.579 --> 13:38.513
It's not the feed.
It's something else.

13:38.582 --> 13:41.415
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, Mr. Hanley.

13:41.483 --> 13:43.484
I mean, yes, the horses
do seem a little antsy,

13:43.552 --> 13:45.720
but other than that
they're fine.

13:45.788 --> 13:47.288
Perhaps you should come back
here this evening

13:47.355 --> 13:50.191
and see for yourself
what I'm dealing with.

13:50.258 --> 13:51.659
H-here at night?

13:52.695 --> 13:54.762
Um... well, I don't know.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.763
I'd have to ask my grandpa.

13:56.831 --> 13:57.965
Do that.

13:58.032 --> 14:00.400
Oh, and one more thing.

14:02.804 --> 14:05.072
The loft is strictly
off limits.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.190
He's sitting
in your section.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.391
What am I supposed
to say?

14:19.459 --> 14:20.826
Tell him I'm cleaning
the bathroom.

14:21.143 --> 14:22.444
He's never gonna
believe that.

14:22.511 --> 14:23.679
Make something up.

14:23.746 --> 14:24.980
Tell him I have the flu
or jury duty.

14:25.048 --> 14:26.247
I don't care.

14:26.315 --> 14:28.784
<i>I can't deal with him
right now, okay?</i>

14:33.055 --> 14:35.489
Hey, Caleb.
What'll it be?

14:35.557 --> 14:36.591
No offence, Soraya,

14:36.658 --> 14:37.725
I was sort of hoping
somebody else

14:37.793 --> 14:39.226
would be serving me today.

14:39.294 --> 14:40.761
Right. Uh, Ashley.

14:40.829 --> 14:43.564
She would,
she's just, um...

14:44.800 --> 14:46.200
Cleaning the bathroom.

14:46.267 --> 14:48.469
Yeah. I bet.

14:48.536 --> 14:50.003
Whatever.

14:50.071 --> 14:51.938
Look, maybe you just need
to give Ashley some more time.

14:52.006 --> 14:54.407
I have given that girl
all the time in the world.

14:54.475 --> 14:55.642
And what do I get in return?

14:55.710 --> 14:58.144
She goes to the school dance
with some frat boy.

14:58.212 --> 14:59.646
Drove you crazy, huh?

14:59.714 --> 15:00.847
No.

15:00.915 --> 15:03.349
Well, come on admit it,
it did a little bit.

15:03.417 --> 15:04.817
'Kay, maybe a very little.

15:04.884 --> 15:05.918
So what're you waiting for?

15:05.986 --> 15:07.419
I mean, just tell her
how you feel.

15:07.487 --> 15:09.955
How am I supposed to do that?
She won't even talk to me.

15:10.023 --> 15:13.225
Well, you have to wait
for the right moment

15:13.292 --> 15:15.327
and then say something sweet,

15:15.394 --> 15:17.028
and smile that smile
of yours,

15:17.096 --> 15:18.330
and everything will be
okay again.

15:18.397 --> 15:19.364
You'll see.

15:24.337 --> 15:26.037
You know, the truth is,

15:26.105 --> 15:30.141
things between me and Ashley
have never really been okay.

15:30.208 --> 15:32.409
I'd be better off
forgetting the whole thing.

15:39.651 --> 15:41.152
I don't know, Amy.

15:41.919 --> 15:43.754
Spending the night
at the Hanley barn

15:43.821 --> 15:45.988
doesn't seem like
a very good idea.

15:46.056 --> 15:47.524
Well, I wouldn't have to spend
the whole night, Grampa.

15:47.591 --> 15:48.625
Just until I find out

15:48.692 --> 15:49.959
what's wrong
with the horses.

15:50.027 --> 15:52.262
If I said yes,

15:52.329 --> 15:54.197
and that's a mighty big if,

15:55.332 --> 15:57.267
I don't want you there
all alone.

15:57.334 --> 16:00.169
I'm sure Ty
would come with me.

16:00.236 --> 16:01.903
Exactly what
I was afraid of.

16:01.971 --> 16:04.306
Grampa,
I'm not a kid any more.

16:04.374 --> 16:05.744
Okay?
I'm 17-years-old

16:05.874 --> 16:08.644
and I think I'm responsible
enough to handle this.

16:08.711 --> 16:09.911
Mr. Hanley hired me

16:09.979 --> 16:11.280
to find out what's wrong
with his horses,

16:11.347 --> 16:12.947
and, well,
I can't do my job

16:13.015 --> 16:15.317
unless I can watch them
overnight.

16:15.385 --> 16:16.417
Please?

16:19.988 --> 16:21.289
So, let me get
this straight.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.491
You're allowed to spend
the whole night,

16:23.559 --> 16:25.959
unsupervised,
in a haunted barn

16:26.027 --> 16:27.061
with the ranch hand

16:27.128 --> 16:28.629
slash former
juvenile delinquent

16:28.697 --> 16:30.298
<i>slash your boyfriend.</i>

16:30.365 --> 16:32.799
Meanwhile, every time I so much
as mention Peter -

16:32.866 --> 16:34.634
my stable and gainfully
employed bf,

16:34.702 --> 16:36.102
I might add,
Mrs. Bell -

16:36.170 --> 16:37.370
grandpa basically reaches
for his shotgun.

16:38.506 --> 16:41.308
My father didn't approve
of my first beau either.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.709
Do you mean Mr. Bell?

16:42.776 --> 16:44.777
Oh no, dear,
I had many sweethearts

16:44.845 --> 16:46.713
before Mr. Bell came along.

16:47.848 --> 16:50.015
There was one boy
in particular.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.184
I gave him a jar of my jam.

16:52.252 --> 16:53.852
I think that's why
he fell in love with me.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.556
Must be some pretty good jam.

16:57.624 --> 16:59.858
He returned
the empty jar to me

16:59.926 --> 17:01.860
with a butterfly inside.

17:01.928 --> 17:04.329
Oh.
That is so romantic.

17:04.396 --> 17:05.863
So, what happened?

17:05.931 --> 17:07.665
It was quite the romance.

17:08.733 --> 17:10.335
We nearly got married,

17:11.470 --> 17:14.070
but it didn't work out
in the end.

17:14.138 --> 17:17.407
That was a very long time ago,

17:17.476 --> 17:19.977
but every year
around canning season

17:20.045 --> 17:22.945
I find myself thinking
'bout that boy

17:23.580 --> 17:25.549
and his silly butterfly.

17:29.053 --> 17:30.153
Here.
I got it, Jack.

17:30.255 --> 17:32.155
Where you been?

17:32.223 --> 17:33.923
Out.
I had some stuff to do.

17:33.991 --> 17:35.559
Well...

17:35.627 --> 17:37.960
I think I saw
that boy Badger

17:38.027 --> 17:39.094
down by the pond earlier.

17:39.162 --> 17:40.863
Is everything all right?

17:40.930 --> 17:42.097
He took off.

17:42.165 --> 17:43.198
I tried talking to him,
but he wouldn't listen.

17:43.300 --> 17:44.634
Here.

17:44.701 --> 17:47.870
A kid like that's got to be
dealing with a lot.

17:47.937 --> 17:50.506
Things a boy his age
shouldn't have to, I reckon.

17:50.574 --> 17:51.607
Yeah, well,
he's Clint's problem now,

17:51.675 --> 17:54.208
- not mine.
- Maybe so.

17:54.527 --> 17:57.161
But if he's here,
he came back for a reason.

17:57.229 --> 17:58.429
And I'm bettin'

17:58.497 --> 17:59.864
it's not because
he misses Lou's cooking.

17:59.932 --> 18:00.899
Look,
if he wanted my help,

18:00.966 --> 18:02.266
then why didn't he ask
for it?

18:02.334 --> 18:04.002
Well, maybe you were
too busy talking, were ya?

18:04.069 --> 18:05.169
You don't understand, Jack.
Okay?

18:05.237 --> 18:06.270
He's different now.

18:06.338 --> 18:07.505
He's got all this attitude
and...

18:07.573 --> 18:09.873
Oh.

18:09.941 --> 18:12.709
Reminds me of someone
I know.

18:15.713 --> 18:17.648
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

18:17.715 --> 18:19.249
Can you hear me now?

18:20.284 --> 18:21.985
Hello?

18:22.053 --> 18:23.020
Hello.

18:25.388 --> 18:27.122
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.624
Jake,
I can't talk right now.

18:28.692 --> 18:30.960
Hey, you didn't forget
about our plans, did you?

18:31.028 --> 18:32.394
No. Of course not.

18:32.462 --> 18:34.463
I just got sidetracked.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.800
Do you mind if we go riding
tomorrow instead?

18:37.868 --> 18:38.801
Okay.

18:39.970 --> 18:41.036
Okay, um...

18:41.103 --> 18:42.037
Great,
I'll see you then.

18:42.104 --> 18:43.471
Okay.
Two o'clock.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.440
Don't be late.

18:45.507 --> 18:46.474
I won't.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.284
Badger?

18:58.787 --> 19:00.420
I can barely hear you.

19:04.292 --> 19:06.159
Amy, you can't stay overnight
at the Hanley barn.

19:06.227 --> 19:07.494
I get it, Mallory.

19:07.562 --> 19:09.162
I'm just a little too old
to believe in ghost stories.

19:09.230 --> 19:10.931
No, you don't understand.

19:10.999 --> 19:13.399
My mom used to volunteer
at the town archives.

19:13.467 --> 19:15.367
There really was a stable hand
that died in the fire.

19:15.435 --> 19:16.936
Okay,
and even if it were true,

19:17.004 --> 19:18.370
it doesn't mean that the barn
is haunted.

19:18.438 --> 19:20.139
But there's official
city documents

19:20.207 --> 19:22.374
saying that the cause
of the fire was arson.

19:22.476 --> 19:23.676
So?

19:23.744 --> 19:25.945
So that means
the story's true -

19:26.013 --> 19:28.047
that the stable hand fell in love
with the farmer's daughter.

19:28.115 --> 19:29.648
But the farmer
didn't approve.

19:29.716 --> 19:32.317
So one night when the drifter
was fast asleep in the loft...

19:32.384 --> 19:33.986
He set fire to the barn.

19:34.053 --> 19:35.721
We've all heard it
a million times.

19:35.788 --> 19:36.888
A million times.

19:36.956 --> 19:38.556
They say the drifter
doesn't know he's dead,

19:38.625 --> 19:39.691
so he haunts the barn

19:39.759 --> 19:41.392
waiting for the farmer's daughter
to come back to him.

19:42.762 --> 19:44.662
What do you think,
Mrs. Bell?

19:44.730 --> 19:46.030
Do you believe
in ghosts?

19:46.098 --> 19:48.499
In my experience,

19:48.566 --> 19:50.768
it's not houses and barns
that are haunted.

19:50.836 --> 19:54.304
It's the people
who live inside them.

19:56.407 --> 19:57.875
- Hey, Ty.
- Hey.

19:57.943 --> 19:59.443
You know, Grandpa told me
what happened.

19:59.511 --> 20:02.045
It's not your fault
that Badger ran away.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.780
I just hope he's okay.

20:03.848 --> 20:06.049
Hey, um, I know this
is really bad timing,

20:06.117 --> 20:08.584
but I kind of have
a favour to ask of you.

20:08.653 --> 20:10.186
Yeah, sure.
Anything.

20:10.254 --> 20:11.554
Well, before you say that,

20:11.622 --> 20:14.223
you should probably know
it involves a haunted barn.

20:17.460 --> 20:19.227
How many flashlights
do you think we're gonna need?

20:19.295 --> 20:21.797
Well, I'd just rather be
safe than sorry.

20:21.865 --> 20:24.399
You sure you're not letting
Mallory's stories get to you?

20:24.467 --> 20:25.600
I can't believe you guys

20:25.669 --> 20:26.935
are actually going through
with this.

20:27.003 --> 20:29.471
Yeah, I mean it's not like
I believe in ghost stories or anything,

20:29.539 --> 20:31.206
but Mr. Hanley comes in here
a couple of times a month

20:31.274 --> 20:33.141
and he seems
a little bit crazy.

20:33.208 --> 20:34.575
Oh my God.
The last time he was in here,

20:34.643 --> 20:35.777
he bought an ax.

20:35.844 --> 20:37.545
Guys! Stop, okay?

20:37.612 --> 20:39.346
Mr. Hanley is not crazy

20:39.414 --> 20:41.482
and his barn is not haunted.

20:41.550 --> 20:42.516
Come on, Ty,
let's go.

20:42.584 --> 20:44.485
Oh! Help me!

20:44.553 --> 20:46.788
This is so
Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

20:46.855 --> 20:48.255
Man, I love that movie!

20:48.323 --> 20:49.690
<i>Me too!
I had to rent it twice</i>

20:49.757 --> 20:51.591
<i>'cause the first time
I watched it like this.</i>

20:53.127 --> 20:54.728
What time does your shift
end tonight?

20:54.796 --> 20:56.930
<i>Um, in about half an hour.
Why?</i>

20:56.998 --> 20:58.198
I'm thinking maybe
we should go check out

20:58.265 --> 21:00.366
just how "Amityville"
that barn really is.

21:00.434 --> 21:01.367
What do ya say?

21:01.435 --> 21:02.736
You're on.

21:04.572 --> 21:06.605
Mrs. Bell left something
for you there.

21:06.673 --> 21:09.274
Oh, I've been waiting
all day for this.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.777
And as far as I'm concerned,

21:11.845 --> 21:14.646
Mrs. Bell makes the best jam
in the whole darn country.

21:14.715 --> 21:15.981
Uh, correction.

21:16.049 --> 21:17.883
Mrs. Bell and Lou Fleming
make the best jam

21:17.951 --> 21:19.685
in the whole darn country.

21:19.753 --> 21:21.652
You know,
I know I was hesitant

21:21.721 --> 21:22.987
about this whole jam
making thing,

21:23.055 --> 21:24.488
but I'm starting to see

21:24.556 --> 21:26.191
some serious
business potential here.

21:26.258 --> 21:27.625
What? No.

21:27.693 --> 21:29.360
I mean it.
I mean Mrs. Bell's jam

21:29.428 --> 21:30.829
could be the first
in a whole line

21:30.896 --> 21:32.797
of Heartland country
products.

21:32.865 --> 21:34.565
I mean, tourists go crazy
for this stuff.

21:34.633 --> 21:38.001
Well, don't you already
have enough on your plate?

21:38.069 --> 21:39.937
What do you mean,
enough on my plate?

21:40.004 --> 21:41.438
Well, it's just that
you're so busy these days,

21:41.505 --> 21:42.572
what with the dude ranch

21:42.640 --> 21:45.408
and flying off
to God knows where.

21:45.476 --> 21:48.545
I am going away
with Peter for the day.

21:48.613 --> 21:50.413
What is the big deal?

21:50.481 --> 21:52.849
Well, it's a little unusual,
don't you think?

21:52.916 --> 21:55.218
Most folks tend to date
a little closer to home.

21:55.285 --> 21:56.685
No, you know what's unusual?

21:56.754 --> 21:58.387
You letting Amy
spend the night with Ty

21:58.455 --> 21:59.555
in the Hanley barn.

21:59.623 --> 22:02.759
Amy is a responsible girl.
I trust her.

22:02.826 --> 22:04.493
Oh, and I'm not?

22:09.966 --> 22:12.934
Well, no wonder people
think this place is haunted.

22:13.002 --> 22:14.369
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

22:14.436 --> 22:16.238
You're not afraid,
are ya?

22:16.305 --> 22:18.273
No way.

22:18.340 --> 22:20.008
Lions and tigers
and bears!

22:20.076 --> 22:22.010
You stop that,
or I'm gonna leave you here.

22:22.078 --> 22:25.345
Oh, I can see how someone
who's afraid might think that.

22:25.413 --> 22:26.613
You shut up.

22:26.681 --> 22:28.348
- I'm not going anywhere, okay?
- All right.

22:28.416 --> 22:29.549
Besides,
getting the chance

22:29.617 --> 22:30.818
to spend a whole night
alone with you

22:30.886 --> 22:33.154
is well worth a few ghosts.

22:41.453 --> 22:43.121
You know,
somehow I pictured

22:43.188 --> 22:44.288
spending the night
in a haunted barn

22:44.356 --> 22:45.656
to be a lot less...

22:45.724 --> 22:47.825
Boring? I know.

22:47.893 --> 22:51.028
It's kind of romantic
in theory.

22:51.095 --> 22:52.295
It is?

22:52.363 --> 22:55.399
Well, dark barn,
thunderstorm...

22:55.466 --> 22:57.834
Hidden dangers lurking
around every corner...

22:57.902 --> 22:58.968
The smell of manure.

22:59.037 --> 23:01.138
Oh God.
Just kiss me.

23:04.708 --> 23:06.076
Did you hear that?

23:06.144 --> 23:07.010
Yeah.

23:14.984 --> 23:16.385
Hello?

23:29.397 --> 23:31.132
Here's Johnny!

23:33.369 --> 23:34.669
Oh my God!

23:34.736 --> 23:36.204
Caleb, you are such a jerk!

23:36.272 --> 23:38.739
Oh man, you guys should've
seen your faces.

23:38.807 --> 23:39.839
Soraya?!

23:39.907 --> 23:41.341
I couldn't resist.

23:41.409 --> 23:43.577
Yeah, real funny, guys.

23:47.382 --> 23:49.883
Please tell me
that's Mr. Hanley.

23:53.288 --> 23:54.288
Uh...

23:57.091 --> 23:59.058
Should we run?

23:59.126 --> 24:00.893
Don't worry,
I got an ax.

24:00.961 --> 24:02.795
It's better than a hook.

24:08.001 --> 24:08.934
Boo!

24:12.405 --> 24:14.539
<i>You guys are so easy.</i>

24:19.612 --> 24:21.715
Mallory, it's late.
What're you doing here?

24:24.283 --> 24:25.984
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

24:27.752 --> 24:29.753
Yeah.
I guess I do.

24:30.355 --> 24:33.023
What about love
at second sight?

24:33.091 --> 24:36.126
Um, I don't know.

24:36.661 --> 24:37.595
Why?

24:37.662 --> 24:39.630
Because I have this "friend."

24:39.697 --> 24:40.697
And when I say "friend,"

24:40.765 --> 24:42.566
I'm actually talking
about a friend.

24:42.634 --> 24:43.766
Unlike when some people
say "friend"

24:43.834 --> 24:45.201
and they're really
talking about themselves.

24:45.269 --> 24:47.270
No,
this is a real "friend."

24:47.338 --> 24:49.139
Um, I could show you
a picture of her if you want.

24:49.206 --> 24:50.306
She's super pretty.

24:50.374 --> 24:51.874
Yeah, Mallory,
I, I get it.

24:51.942 --> 24:53.610
Okay, so, um...

24:53.677 --> 24:56.179
This friend just met this guy
for a second time

24:56.247 --> 24:59.548
and she can't stop
thinking about him,

24:59.616 --> 25:01.450
although he's totally
wrong for her

25:01.518 --> 25:02.451
and nobody would approve,

25:02.519 --> 25:04.620
especially not her parents.

25:04.687 --> 25:06.555
She can't help it.
It's like...

25:06.623 --> 25:08.524
Every time
she closes her eyes,

25:08.591 --> 25:10.492
he's there, so...

25:11.861 --> 25:13.962
What should she do?

25:14.030 --> 25:15.496
Um...

25:15.564 --> 25:19.500
Well, if this "friend"
really likes this guy,

25:19.568 --> 25:22.336
then maybe she shouldn't
worry so much

25:22.404 --> 25:23.737
about what other
people think,

25:23.805 --> 25:24.972
you know?

25:25.040 --> 25:26.541
I mean, you can change
someone's mind,

25:26.608 --> 25:29.644
but you can't change
your own heart.

25:29.711 --> 25:31.378
Thanks, Lou.

25:31.445 --> 25:33.480
Um, I have to go do
something important

25:33.548 --> 25:35.715
that's completely unrelated

25:35.783 --> 25:38.218
to what we were
just talking about.

25:38.286 --> 25:39.252
Right.

25:40.788 --> 25:41.821
<i>So...</i>

25:43.057 --> 25:45.225
<i>This is the famous
Hanley barn.</i>

25:45.293 --> 25:46.859
Let's check out the loft.

25:46.927 --> 25:48.294
<i>No, Ashley.
Ashley, please.</i>

25:48.361 --> 25:50.462
Look, guys, if Mr. Hanley comes
and finds you here,

25:50.530 --> 25:51.863
<i>he's gonna tell my grampa</i>

25:51.931 --> 25:53.666
and he'll never trust me again.
<i>Please, just go.</i>

25:53.733 --> 25:55.167
Yeah, come on, guys.
Party's over.

25:55.235 --> 25:56.535
<i>Okay.</i>

25:56.603 --> 26:00.005
Let's leave Ty and Amy alone
to horse watch.

26:00.073 --> 26:01.340
Oo-ooo-oo-ooh!

26:01.408 --> 26:03.374
<i>Boo!</i>

26:06.612 --> 26:08.045
Caleb! Caleb!

26:08.113 --> 26:11.683
Remember that "right moment"
I was talking to you about?

26:11.783 --> 26:12.750
Go!

26:14.353 --> 26:15.587
Go!

26:15.688 --> 26:16.688
Heh.

26:27.348 --> 26:28.748
Well, you haven't kicked me
out of the car yet.

26:28.816 --> 26:31.217
I'd say that's
a pretty good sign.

26:31.285 --> 26:34.087
So, did you have
a nice night with Soraya?

26:34.154 --> 26:36.088
Yeah.
That was awesome.

26:36.155 --> 26:37.089
Hmm.

26:38.124 --> 26:39.291
Wait a second.

26:39.359 --> 26:41.426
You followed me and Soraya
out here, didn't you?

26:41.495 --> 26:42.962
No.

26:43.029 --> 26:44.329
You're jealous.

26:44.397 --> 26:46.932
No.
Soraya's jealous of me.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.334
Right. Because you work
for her mom,

26:49.402 --> 26:51.870
you live in a trailer -
my trailer.

26:51.937 --> 26:54.472
She's definitely
the jealous one.

26:54.540 --> 26:56.908
So what,
now you're defending her?

26:56.976 --> 26:57.942
She's my friend.

26:58.010 --> 27:00.678
Yeah, I can see that.

27:00.779 --> 27:01.980
You're jealous.

27:02.047 --> 27:04.749
Okay, now I'm kicking you
out of my car.

27:06.552 --> 27:08.451
It's too late now.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.020
Looks like you're stuck
with me.

27:13.591 --> 27:15.526
Whoa! Whoa!
What?! What?!

27:17.228 --> 27:18.695
There's someone out there!

27:23.167 --> 27:24.600
I don't see anyone,
Ash.

27:24.668 --> 27:25.668
Just forget it.

27:25.736 --> 27:26.936
Let's just get out of here,
okay?

27:36.112 --> 27:37.346
<i>You know, I don't get it.</i>

27:37.414 --> 27:39.548
We've been here for what,
over three hours

27:39.615 --> 27:42.684
and the horses seem fine,
even in the storm.

27:42.752 --> 27:43.952
Maybe everyone's right.

27:44.020 --> 27:45.954
Maybe Mr. Hanley's
just a crazy old man.

27:51.694 --> 27:53.795
There's a breaker
box at the front.

27:53.863 --> 27:55.163
I'll be right back.

28:00.501 --> 28:01.769
All right.

28:25.859 --> 28:26.793
Caleb?

28:30.463 --> 28:31.463
Come on, man.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.453
<i>Anyone there?</i>

29:15.139 --> 29:16.071
Hello?

29:28.417 --> 29:29.351
Amy!

29:30.253 --> 29:31.219
Amy!

29:34.222 --> 29:36.323
Ungh!

29:43.532 --> 29:44.666
Amy!

29:44.733 --> 29:46.034
Amy!

29:46.101 --> 29:47.101
What?

29:48.469 --> 29:50.270
Uh, nothing.
I...

29:51.706 --> 29:54.307
Ty. Ty, look at this.
See this grave?

29:54.375 --> 29:55.441
This is the grave
of those horses

29:55.509 --> 29:56.677
<i>who died in the fire.</i>

29:56.744 --> 29:58.611
And look at the date.
1942.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.280
Check out this one.

30:00.347 --> 30:02.149
Thomas Ritter.

30:02.516 --> 30:03.816
<i>So?</i>

30:03.884 --> 30:06.485
So! He died the same year
the horses did in the fire.

30:06.553 --> 30:07.753
This must be the grave
of...

30:07.821 --> 30:08.921
- The drifter.
- Yes.

30:12.693 --> 30:15.061
You know,
maybe Mallory was right.

30:15.128 --> 30:18.030
Maybe those stories
are true.

30:18.098 --> 30:21.132
Or maybe it's just
a coincidence.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.300
Come on,
let's get inside

30:22.367 --> 30:24.435
before this storm
gets any worse.

30:29.742 --> 30:31.142
Hey, you okay?

30:32.211 --> 30:35.846
Yeah, I just...

30:35.914 --> 30:37.881
I feel kind of silly,
I don't know.

30:37.949 --> 30:39.750
I'm just letting this place
get to me.

30:47.859 --> 30:49.893
There is definitely
someone up there.

30:49.961 --> 30:51.061
Or something.

30:53.931 --> 30:54.864
Come on.

31:04.208 --> 31:05.041
Hello?

31:13.883 --> 31:14.850
<i>Look.</i>

31:18.820 --> 31:19.820
Be careful.

31:21.456 --> 31:22.389
Ahh!

31:24.793 --> 31:25.926
Mallory?!

31:26.728 --> 31:28.796
Hey, guys.
Pretty crazy weather, huh?

31:28.864 --> 31:30.064
What're you doing here?

31:42.342 --> 31:45.011
I think we found
our ghost.

31:45.079 --> 31:46.045
Badger!

31:48.848 --> 31:50.448
Ungh!

31:55.521 --> 31:56.388
Wait!

31:57.523 --> 31:58.757
Why, so you can call Clint
again?

31:58.825 --> 32:00.192
I didn't call him.
He just showed up.

32:00.260 --> 32:01.760
Yeah, right, Ty!

32:01.828 --> 32:03.561
Badger!

32:03.629 --> 32:04.561
Ahh!

32:14.323 --> 32:17.225
So you're the one who's been
messing with my horses.

32:17.292 --> 32:20.662
No, Mr. Hanley.
Look, these are my friends.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.731
They didn't touch your horses,
I swear.

32:22.798 --> 32:24.432
<i>I saw flashlights upstairs.</i>

32:24.500 --> 32:26.535
I thought I told you
the loft's off limits.

32:26.602 --> 32:29.670
There's dry rot.
The floor's not safe.

32:29.738 --> 32:31.471
And what is this,
a party?

32:31.540 --> 32:34.107
I'm really sorry.
They were just leaving.

32:34.175 --> 32:38.712
I hope I didn't make a mistake
hiring you, miss Fleming.

32:42.984 --> 32:44.717
Mallory, Badger,
get in the truck.

32:44.785 --> 32:46.085
I'm so sorry, Ty. I...

32:46.153 --> 32:47.153
I don't wanna hear it!
Now get in the truck!

32:50.524 --> 32:52.825
Badger, take Mallory and go.
Now!

32:55.696 --> 32:56.696
<i>There gonna kick
the walls down.</i>

32:56.764 --> 32:57.764
Amy!

32:57.831 --> 33:00.165
Ty, I have to let
the horses out.

33:00.266 --> 33:01.633
I'm going with you.

33:05.805 --> 33:07.005
Whoa. Easy, boy.

33:07.073 --> 33:08.473
Hold on, hold on.

33:11.744 --> 33:15.313
Come on, come on.
Steady now, steady.

33:52.048 --> 33:54.149
Who are you?!

33:54.217 --> 33:56.652
<i>You were here yesterday,
talking with Mr. Hanley.</i>

33:56.720 --> 33:58.186
Get your hands off of me!

33:58.254 --> 33:59.588
Not until you tell me
what you're doing here.

34:04.226 --> 34:05.860
It's a glycogen loader.

34:05.928 --> 34:07.128
What's that?

34:07.195 --> 34:08.362
It's like a sugar bomb
used for racehorses

34:08.429 --> 34:10.031
to energize them.

34:10.099 --> 34:11.599
<i>You have been putting this
in Mr. Hanley's horses feed.</i>

34:11.667 --> 34:13.167
It's why they've been so antsy.

34:13.235 --> 34:15.202
Get off of me!

34:15.270 --> 34:17.005
Mr. Hanley could've lost
his business because of you,

34:17.072 --> 34:18.339
his home!

34:18.406 --> 34:19.607
The sooner he
leaves the better.

34:21.609 --> 34:22.574
Brent!

34:24.779 --> 34:27.748
Have you got something
to tell me?

34:27.815 --> 34:28.748
<i>Why?</i>

34:35.089 --> 34:38.389
Well, I'm just glad
to hear you're okay.

34:38.458 --> 34:41.092
All right,
you come home soon now.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.494
Bye.

34:44.364 --> 34:46.264
Uh, that was Amy.

34:46.331 --> 34:48.333
Sounds like they had
quite the night,

34:48.400 --> 34:50.469
but... she's okay.

34:51.337 --> 34:52.937
You were up all night
worrying about her,

34:53.005 --> 34:53.938
weren't you?

34:54.005 --> 34:56.607
Well...
She's all right,

34:56.676 --> 34:59.277
and I guess that's
all that matters.

34:59.344 --> 35:02.180
Well, like you said,
she's a responsible girl.

35:04.717 --> 35:06.350
Uh, look.
Uh, Lou?

35:06.418 --> 35:07.385
<i>Lou?</i>

35:11.389 --> 35:14.391
I know it might seem
like sometimes

35:14.458 --> 35:16.326
I'm too easy on Amy.

35:17.428 --> 35:19.129
<i>It's just that...</i>

35:19.197 --> 35:23.000
She reminds me so damn much
of your mom.

35:23.068 --> 35:25.034
And if I'm too hard
on you,

35:25.102 --> 35:27.303
it's because you
remind me of...

35:27.370 --> 35:28.905
Great.
I remind you of dad.

35:28.972 --> 35:30.773
I get it.

35:31.091 --> 35:32.491
Actually...

35:34.361 --> 35:38.030
I was going to say that
you remind me of me.

35:43.669 --> 35:47.005
Well, you're sure stubborn
like me,

35:47.073 --> 35:49.174
<i>and independent,
and...</i>

35:51.077 --> 35:52.177
So independent

35:52.244 --> 35:54.579
that I wonder how long
it's gonna be

35:54.646 --> 35:56.913
before you go flying off
to New York

35:56.982 --> 35:57.914
<i>or Denver,</i>

35:57.983 --> 36:00.884
or, God forbid,
Toronto,

36:02.520 --> 36:04.488
and never come back.

36:06.091 --> 36:08.058
And as for Peter...

36:09.227 --> 36:12.095
It's not that
I don't approve.

36:13.130 --> 36:14.563
It's just...

36:19.036 --> 36:22.705
Well, I don't want him
to take you away,

36:23.640 --> 36:24.974
that's all.

36:26.843 --> 36:28.576
Grandpa...

36:29.979 --> 36:33.648
No one is taking me away.
Okay?

36:34.717 --> 36:36.651
Promise.

36:36.719 --> 36:40.688
Now don't you make promises
you can't keep.

36:42.691 --> 36:44.458
And that will be
the last time

36:44.526 --> 36:47.061
I ever tell you
what to do.

36:47.129 --> 36:48.829
Don't you make promises
you can't keep.

36:59.207 --> 37:00.773
Grandpa?

37:00.841 --> 37:01.807
Yeah?

37:03.344 --> 37:06.446
Can I get a ride
to the airport?

37:19.526 --> 37:22.094
Maybe you could put
a good word in for me with Clint.

37:23.829 --> 37:26.564
You know,
soften him up a bit.

37:27.566 --> 37:28.966
Well, that depends.

37:30.069 --> 37:32.004
Are you gonna tell me
what happened?

37:33.472 --> 37:36.307
This whole
running away thing...

37:37.809 --> 37:39.009
I didn't plan that.

37:43.414 --> 37:46.516
I just felt like
going home.

37:46.584 --> 37:48.585
My real home, I mean.

37:49.620 --> 37:51.254
Just to visit.

37:54.225 --> 37:57.526
Take it it didn't work out
so well?

37:57.594 --> 37:58.527
No.

38:02.299 --> 38:05.634
When I got there
the place was empty.

38:06.636 --> 38:08.437
My parents had moved.

38:10.207 --> 38:13.174
They didn't even bother
to send me a forwarding address.

38:14.243 --> 38:16.010
After that,

38:16.078 --> 38:19.414
I couldn't go back
to that group home.

38:19.482 --> 38:22.683
So... I came here.

38:26.188 --> 38:29.089
I know.
Stupid.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.460
No, it wasn't stupid.

38:37.765 --> 38:39.399
But next time things
get really bad,

38:39.467 --> 38:41.235
you come here,
cool off for a few days.

38:41.302 --> 38:42.736
No more running,
okay?

38:46.039 --> 38:47.640
'Kay.

38:47.707 --> 38:49.775
And no more hiding out
in haunted barns.

38:54.047 --> 38:56.649
Clint's gonna kill me,
isn't he?

38:56.716 --> 38:59.318
I wouldn't worry
about Clint.

38:59.386 --> 39:01.686
He's all about eye contact.

39:01.754 --> 39:04.689
Just look him in the eyes.

39:04.757 --> 39:07.759
Start with something like,
uh...

39:09.795 --> 39:11.530
"I'm truly sorry
for what I've done..."

39:11.597 --> 39:13.231
Recently I've made
some very bad choices

39:13.299 --> 39:15.667
and I realize there'll be
re...

39:19.871 --> 39:22.005
Repercussions.

39:23.975 --> 39:26.210
<i>But if you give me
a second chance,</i>

39:26.278 --> 39:28.879
I promise to make
better decisions

39:28.946 --> 39:31.848
<i>and work towards
improving my future.</i>

39:31.916 --> 39:34.184
Well, I'm glad you understand
the gravity of the situation.

39:34.251 --> 39:35.351
Running away,
I mean, as you know,

39:35.419 --> 39:38.154
that's a very serious
offence.

39:39.122 --> 39:41.491
However, I am impressed
by the mature attitude

39:41.559 --> 39:43.726
that you've demonstrated
here today.

39:44.044 --> 39:45.978
So, duly noted.

39:47.714 --> 39:49.147
Clearly, this experience

39:49.214 --> 39:51.616
has taught you
something important.

40:14.038 --> 40:15.973
I waited for you
at Clairdale Ridge.

40:16.074 --> 40:17.274
You never came.

40:18.309 --> 40:20.610
Ah, Jake, I'm so sorry.

40:21.545 --> 40:23.412
I totally forgot.
I'll make it up to you.

40:23.481 --> 40:24.914
Um...

40:24.982 --> 40:26.616
We can go get some ice cream
this afternoon.

40:26.684 --> 40:28.217
My treat.

40:28.285 --> 40:29.652
You know,
I don't think so.

40:29.720 --> 40:30.920
I actually have
a pretty busy afternoon.

40:30.988 --> 40:32.922
But you have
a good day now.

40:32.990 --> 40:34.357
Jake, wait.

40:35.192 --> 40:37.893
I don't have any more time left
to wait for you, Mallory.

40:44.300 --> 40:47.736
Mr. Hanley: Brent's been after
me to sell this place for years.

40:47.804 --> 40:50.372
Guess he got tired of waiting.

40:50.439 --> 40:55.409
Well, the good news is
the horses are gonna be fine.

40:55.477 --> 40:58.012
I wish I could say the same
about this place.

40:58.079 --> 40:59.680
Fact is,
I've been facing foreclosure

40:59.748 --> 41:02.884
long before Brent's
little schemes.

41:02.951 --> 41:04.952
He just sped things along.

41:05.020 --> 41:07.054
Mr. Hanley?

41:07.122 --> 41:08.989
I'm gonna recommend you
on our Heartland website.

41:09.056 --> 41:10.223
We get a ton of hits

41:10.290 --> 41:11.825
and I'm sure it'll fill up
your stable.

41:11.893 --> 41:13.627
Why would you do that
for me?

41:13.694 --> 41:15.428
'Cause you care about horses.

41:15.496 --> 41:17.397
That says a lot
about a person.

41:23.704 --> 41:24.603
Whoa.

41:24.671 --> 41:26.805
What's Mrs. Bell
doing here?

41:26.873 --> 41:29.775
She stops by this time
every year.

41:29.843 --> 41:31.076
<i>Her family used to own
this farm</i>

41:31.144 --> 41:33.211
<i>before my dad bought it.</i>

41:34.180 --> 41:38.116
Must be some loved ones
buried out there.

42:05.009 --> 42:06.409
<i>How did it go with Clint?</i>

42:07.478 --> 42:09.211
Well...

42:09.279 --> 42:11.313
I'm pretty much grounded.

42:13.016 --> 42:15.550
Could've been
a lot worse.

42:18.421 --> 42:19.621
Look, I, uh...

42:20.590 --> 42:22.658
I hope I didn't get you
into any trouble.

42:22.725 --> 42:24.026
No, I'm good,

42:24.094 --> 42:27.495
I can pretty much talk myself
out of anything.

42:27.562 --> 42:29.630
I have a confession.

42:31.333 --> 42:34.135
I looked through
your sketchbook

42:34.203 --> 42:35.569
and you drew me.

42:36.705 --> 42:38.239
I mean,
you could've drawn anyone,

42:38.307 --> 42:41.341
but... you drew me.

42:50.318 --> 42:51.618
That's Clint.

42:51.686 --> 42:53.120
I better go.

42:55.356 --> 42:56.323
Bye.

42:56.390 --> 42:57.389
Bye.

43:06.934 --> 43:09.135
Hey, you ready to go?

43:13.239 --> 43:14.472
<i>You're not gonna believe this,</i>

43:14.540 --> 43:18.877
but Mrs. Bell is the girl
in Mallory's ghost story.

43:18.945 --> 43:21.146
Thomas Ritter
is her first boyfriend;

43:21.214 --> 43:24.482
The one who gave her
the butterfly.

43:25.751 --> 43:26.751
You know,
all these years

43:26.819 --> 43:28.286
it wasn't the barn
that was haunted.

43:30.755 --> 43:33.090
<i>Come on,
let's get outta here.</i>

43:33.158 --> 43:34.791
