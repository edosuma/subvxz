02:06.327 --> 02:07.995
Any comments you wanted me

02:08.061 --> 02:09.562
to pass along to Mr. Stahr?

02:09.630 --> 02:12.065
Yes.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.402
Tell him I think
his director is a putz.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.505
I know you don't know
what that means,

02:17.571 --> 02:19.873
-but he will.
-I know what it means.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.041
Will that be all?

02:21.108 --> 02:23.544
Yes. Thank you, Felicity.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.623
Mr. Brady?

02:36.890 --> 02:38.326
Yes?

02:38.392 --> 02:40.127
Martin Ringler.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.329
Your board sent me

02:41.395 --> 02:43.063
to look at your books.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.565
Why would they do that?

02:44.632 --> 02:46.800
Well, not to put too fine
a point on it, sir,

02:46.867 --> 02:49.203
but they claim you've put
the studio in arrears.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.871
Is that right?

02:50.938 --> 02:52.540
A loan from Mr. Mayer,

02:52.606 --> 02:54.975
paid back with interest
pre-term.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.010
Salaries cut, then restored.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.212
How much do you weigh?

02:58.279 --> 03:00.248
Sir?

03:00.314 --> 03:01.882
You like numbers, give me one.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.585
140 pounds.

03:04.652 --> 03:07.488
Soaking wet. Now get out of here
before I snap you in two.

03:07.555 --> 03:10.624
Mr. Brady, I have a letter here
from your board

03:10.691 --> 03:12.025
ordering you to furnish
said investigator

03:12.092 --> 03:16.063
with any records or files
he might require.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.831
"Investigator"?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.066
Yes, sir.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.534
I'm a forensic accountant.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.403
I review your books,
then present the board

03:22.470 --> 03:23.704
with my recommendations.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.440
I don't need any
recommendations.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.342
We have a cash flow problem
at present.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.543
So we spend less.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.780
Where shall I set myself up,
sir?

03:36.183 --> 03:40.488
* *

03:52.800 --> 03:55.235
You know,
you can stop staring at it.

03:55.303 --> 03:58.372
-(chuckles)
-It won't disappear.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.173
Brought you some cheaters.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.575
Oh.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.911
You're going to be
bathed in jewels.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.679
Maybe a car, too.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.083
Oh, and, of course, your
luggage-hauling days are over.

04:10.150 --> 04:13.887
It's strictly porters and staff
from here on out.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.790
So I'm royalty now?

04:17.725 --> 04:19.493
At Brady-American, you are.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.630
A marriage contract?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.832
Of sorts.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.166
Your seven-picture deal.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.035
Pat's idea.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.970
Seven? Oh, my goodness.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.606
How sexy.
(chuckles)

04:34.342 --> 04:36.444
Which page do I sign?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.945
You might want to read it first.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.246
With your lawyer.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.982
-I don't have a lawyer.
-I'll get you one.

04:42.049 --> 04:45.152
And we shouldn't discuss this
again until he's weighed in.

04:45.218 --> 04:48.322
You and I are now adversaries
in a business negotiation.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.490
Technically.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.124
You saying I can't trust you?

04:51.191 --> 04:53.861
Look, it's my job
to exploit you.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.164
Okay, movie man...

04:57.230 --> 04:58.699
exploit me.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.771
(Kathleen moans softly)

05:03.837 --> 05:07.040
CHOIR:
* Christmas is here *

05:07.107 --> 05:08.642
(choir holds final note)

05:11.111 --> 05:13.381
What a picture.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.782
Wonderful.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.650
Charming.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.051
Leslie Reeves was
an inspired choice.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.420
What made you think of him?

05:19.487 --> 05:20.588
Well, ask Pat.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.889
This was his baby.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.191
-HOPPER: Is that so?
-It sure was.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.059
I didn't even see any rushes.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.929
We're glad you liked
the picture, Hedda.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.264
But it's an underdog,
like we are.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.802
The same three studios getting
all the nominations every year.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.303
Angels needs a champion.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.406
That's sweet.

05:38.472 --> 05:39.907
The little studio that could.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.909
So,

05:41.975 --> 05:43.944
I write a column
fawning all over it,

05:44.011 --> 05:46.079
saying that it's my favorite
picture of the year...

05:47.981 --> 05:52.420
...infuriating Louis Mayer,
Jack Warner, and Harry Cohn.

05:52.486 --> 05:55.556
And I get... what?

05:55.623 --> 05:57.124
Well, the satisfaction
of praising a picture

05:57.190 --> 05:58.291
that actually deserves it.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.793
Mm.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.397
Or, maybe,
the story behind the walkout

06:03.464 --> 06:04.798
that your employees just staged?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.334
That... that was no walkout.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.637
A payroll guy lost
some salary checks.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.272
It created a minor stir,
but we fixed it in a jiffy

06:12.339 --> 06:13.874
and everybody went back to work.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.843
Hmm.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.546
Except for the payroll guy,
I assume.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.381
(chuckles):
No, no, we kept him on, too.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.784
Everyone's entitled
to a mistake.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.118
Ah.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.488
Well, then you and I are...

06:27.555 --> 06:29.723
-one exclusive shy of a deal.
-BRADY: Oh...

06:34.562 --> 06:36.997
Monroe...

06:37.064 --> 06:38.532
what about your fiancÃ©e?

06:38.599 --> 06:41.201
An unknown offered a lead

06:41.268 --> 06:42.570
in your next picture?

06:42.636 --> 06:44.104
Who is she?
What was her childhood like?

06:44.171 --> 06:46.406
-Her family? -I'd kind of
like to know that, too.

06:46.474 --> 06:50.644
HOPPER: I want to profile her,
with pictures, of course.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.012
Go back to her hometown
in Ireland,

06:52.079 --> 06:54.181
the house she grew up in,
her parents.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.217
My readers love all that,
especially if it's... humble.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.719
Humble does sell.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.589
-HOPPER: Yes.
-Her father passed away.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.657
And her mother?

07:06.026 --> 07:07.427
Good.

07:07.495 --> 07:08.662
Can I count on the studio

07:08.729 --> 07:10.097
to arrange it all for me?

07:10.163 --> 07:12.666
And when I say "arrange,"
I do mean "pay for."

07:12.733 --> 07:14.367
(chuckles):
Yeah.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.303
Then consider Angels plugged.

07:16.369 --> 07:17.705
Hmm.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.673
(Brady clears throat)

07:22.275 --> 07:23.711
You know, new rule:

07:23.777 --> 07:25.679
let's stop with
the false humility bit.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.047
"It was Pat's baby."

07:27.114 --> 07:28.181
It's irritating as hell.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.117
My intention was to
give you the credit.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.652
See what it cost us,

07:31.719 --> 07:33.053
this little stunt your writers
pulled by walking out?

07:33.120 --> 07:34.588
An embarrassment
to the whole studio.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.490
It wasn't little,
and it wasn't a stunt.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.659
And then they blab it
all over town.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.061
I am happy to indulge this
as soon as you tell me

07:41.128 --> 07:43.697
how that'll get us
closer to an Oscar.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.999
You giving me
dialogue notes now?

07:50.804 --> 07:53.641
CELIA:
Where is Mr. Lang?

07:53.707 --> 07:56.910
Fritz, it's the speech
you asked for yesterday.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.380
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm,
mm, I asked you for life.

08:00.447 --> 08:01.815
You give me words.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.384
-CELIA: Fritz, is there...
-Don't interrupt me!

08:04.451 --> 08:07.187
This scheisse might be good
enough for Monroe,

08:07.254 --> 08:08.756
but it's not cinema!

08:08.822 --> 08:10.791
Is there a reason
our art director

08:10.858 --> 08:12.726
-just drove off our lot?
-Yes, there is a reason.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.227
Because I fired him

08:14.294 --> 08:17.264
after he defiled me
on the look for the staircase.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.566
It's "defied."

08:18.632 --> 08:20.467
And you can't,
he's under contract.

08:20.534 --> 08:23.036
Oh, I can't? I can't? Really?

08:23.103 --> 08:25.939
Then please, by all means,
please, bring him back.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.342
And I will just put a title card
in front of every scene

08:29.409 --> 08:34.081
in the picture saying,
"This offensive and lifeless set

08:34.147 --> 08:37.951
was not approved by
the picture's director."

08:38.018 --> 08:40.187
This is what I get
for having someone's daughter

08:40.253 --> 08:42.623
-as my producer. -If you tell me
when something's troubling you,

08:42.690 --> 08:43.991
I can fix it, but I can't...

08:44.057 --> 08:46.093
You know what
you can fix for me?

08:46.159 --> 08:49.296
Coffee, black, no sugar.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.670
* *

09:06.780 --> 09:08.982
WOMAN:
Yes sir, I'm on my way!

09:09.049 --> 09:10.718
How's the set looking, Celia?

09:11.785 --> 09:14.588
Hi, Monroe.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.290
Lang living up
to his reputation?

09:17.357 --> 09:18.892
He's all bark.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.493
You want me to talk to him?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.930
No, no, I'm taking care of it.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.564
Anything at all I can do?

09:25.633 --> 09:27.801
Yes.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.203
You can find a new art director.

09:30.270 --> 09:33.106
This one was subpar.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.943
Attagirl.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.714
(car engine idling)

09:40.781 --> 09:42.249
(car door closes)

09:42.315 --> 09:44.317
(car drives off)

09:52.059 --> 09:53.560
Rupert?

09:53.627 --> 09:54.962
VAJNA:
I'm up here.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.908
(scoffs)

10:07.975 --> 10:09.977
You said it was an emergency.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.312
It is. I got you something.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.748
I didn't want to die
without giving it to you.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.350
It's my apology.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.052
I don't want one.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.822
I don't want anything from you.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.256
You won't even open it?

10:23.323 --> 10:26.193
Rupert, you hit me.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.594
I know. I'm sorry.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.062
It'll never happen again.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.065
I got jealous, kiddo,
of you and him.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.801
Dumb, right?

10:35.402 --> 10:37.738
I guess...

10:37.805 --> 10:42.075
somewhere deep down
I always hoped we'd...

10:42.142 --> 10:44.077
I don't know.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.278
Please?

10:45.345 --> 10:47.380
Just open it?

10:57.157 --> 11:00.293
'Member? Your first week here?

11:00.360 --> 11:03.396
I pointed to that sign
and I said,

11:03.463 --> 11:04.932
"If you do like I ask,

11:04.998 --> 11:08.635
one day, you'll have
all Hollywood in your hands."

11:08.702 --> 11:12.139
And now you do.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.140
Seven pictures.

11:13.206 --> 11:17.277
I know, I know, you love him.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.547
I just don't want you
to hate me.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.282
This should be the fun part.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.855
* *

11:31.491 --> 11:33.226
Yeah.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.862
Fun.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.978
Right on time.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.882
Actually,
I need a few more weeks.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.383
Mister, we were robbed.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.952
That's rough,
but that's not my problem.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.354
Tramp jumped me,
took every penny.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.556
And I get stiffed?

12:03.623 --> 12:04.925
Swell?

12:07.394 --> 12:09.963
I'm prepared...

12:10.030 --> 12:14.234
for any consequences
that you want to give me.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.870
Give me a little credit.

12:16.937 --> 12:20.040
I'm a businessman,
I'm not an animal.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.475
I'll tell you what,
I give you a little more time,

12:22.542 --> 12:25.012
if you do me a favor.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.914
My brother-in-law,
big pictures fan.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.481
Maybe you sneak him on the lot,

12:28.548 --> 12:29.682
show him around a little bit,

12:29.749 --> 12:31.118
let him take some pictures.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.654
Uh... I don't know, uh...

12:34.721 --> 12:36.223
Th-They got rules about that.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.291
30 minutes, then he's gone,
and I'll give you a month

12:38.358 --> 12:41.328
to get back on your feet,
with interest, of course.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.797
Now, I ask you,

12:43.864 --> 12:45.765
would an animal make you
an offer that fair?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.203
Good evening, John.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.705
-I appreciated the extra day.
-That's fine, fine.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.508
-You keep working hard.
-Sure will.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.845
LANG: Wir zeigen wie echtes Bier
schmek, neh?

12:57.911 --> 13:02.549
Hier pissen sie in eine Flasche
und hangen eine Schleife drum!

13:02.615 --> 13:06.219
Oh. Heil, Fritz.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.587
Hi, Hannah.

13:07.654 --> 13:11.224
Aubrey, I just dropped by to see
how you were coming along

13:11.291 --> 13:12.893
with the notes I had given you.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.195
Swell. I understand
almost half of them.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.997
And then we found
this deck of cards,

13:17.064 --> 13:19.732
and one thing led to another.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.302
Another what?

13:22.369 --> 13:24.704
It's a wonderful game.
I can show you.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.140
Yeah, many tricks to it.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.676
It's very Bavarian in that way.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.644
It's called Schapfkopf.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.581
Why is it that every German word
winds up sounding like

13:34.647 --> 13:36.283
a new means of killing someone?

13:39.219 --> 13:41.454
Well, I will take my leave.

13:41.521 --> 13:45.859
Perhaps we will finish our game
another time, Hannah, yeah?

13:48.795 --> 13:51.398
(pop music playing on radio)

13:54.902 --> 13:57.070
(sighs)

13:58.538 --> 14:01.141
Maybe he didn't come here
to talk about notes after all.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.778
That was very embarrassing.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.115
Look, Hannah, you're beautiful.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.883
And I expect men
to flirt with you.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.351
But, please, anybody but him.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.853
He's just lonely.
I understand that.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.523
He's a monster.
And he's my boss.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.992
Is that why I came all this way?

14:19.059 --> 14:21.361
To be told who not to talk to?

14:21.428 --> 14:25.665
Look, this... this lot is
teeming with German Ã©migrÃ©s.

14:25.732 --> 14:26.866
Ju-Just pick another one.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.201
You're being ridiculous.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.402
Then let me be ridiculous,

14:29.469 --> 14:31.838
just about this one thing...
please.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.574
It was just
a friendly card game.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.511
Not the way he plays it.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.191
This is the back lot.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.525
Now, this New York Street,

14:52.592 --> 14:54.561
this used to be a, uh,
a Hooverville.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.830
-Homes everywhere.
-JAMEY: Huh. Whoa!

14:57.897 --> 15:01.434
Take your life in your hands
walking around this place.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.940
My... my.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.509
(exhales)

15:09.576 --> 15:12.279
-The don't make 'em
like that in Missouri. -Yeah.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.114
You a fan of Margo Taft?
She's shooting on Stage 6,

15:14.181 --> 15:15.815
and if you're lucky,
you might see her walking

15:15.882 --> 15:17.250
from the stage to her trailer.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.652
Sure.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.921
Say, is there a john nearby?

15:21.989 --> 15:23.456
Yes, it's right over there.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.825
Hey, listen,
if anybody stops you,

15:25.892 --> 15:27.527
asks what you're doing here,
just say

15:27.594 --> 15:30.030
you were making a delivery,
and you got lost

15:30.097 --> 15:31.664
on your way out, okay?

15:31.731 --> 15:34.701
Delivery.
Got lost.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.003
Check.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.638
-(bicycle bell ringing)
-BIRDY: Max!

15:40.540 --> 15:41.674
Where have you been?

15:41.741 --> 15:43.776
I've been looking
all over the lot for you.

15:43.843 --> 15:44.944
Mr. Brady wants to see you.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.580
Uh... yeah, I was just, uh...

15:47.647 --> 15:48.848
What was this about?

15:48.915 --> 15:50.583
What difference does it make?

15:50.650 --> 15:52.485
He wants to see you.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.486
Now.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.322
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be right along.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.957
I just, uh... uh, I had to
deliver a message

15:58.025 --> 16:00.593
for Mr. Stahr, so, uh...

16:00.660 --> 16:04.031
I'll get back to the office
as soon as it's done, okay?

16:05.532 --> 16:07.967
Make sure you do.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.307
Hey!

16:17.444 --> 16:21.281
MAN:
Slow it down. Turn now.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.518
What the hell is this?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.254
It's for Kitty.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.456
Hospital's releasing her
tomorrow.

16:29.522 --> 16:33.026
So she's staying here,
in our parlor?

16:33.093 --> 16:34.894
I want her
right outside the bedroom

16:34.961 --> 16:36.396
in case of an emergency.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.598
If there's an emergency,
she should be somewhere else.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.402
Pat, they were gonna send her
to the west side shelter.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.237
Because she's sick, isn't she?

16:44.304 --> 16:46.673
I want to take care of her.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.541
She needs looking after.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.711
But this is where
I do my crossword puzzle.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.213
(Rose sighs)

16:54.314 --> 16:55.448
Oh, the hell with it.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.749
I'll do my crossword
on the john.

16:56.816 --> 16:59.786
Mm. Thank you, darling.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.789
-That's heroic of you.
-Mm-hmm.

17:04.090 --> 17:06.126
(Rose humming)

17:06.193 --> 17:08.328
(waves crashing)

17:09.829 --> 17:11.864
Three, four. Uh-oh.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.233
-Getting closer to "Home."
-(Kathleen laughs)

17:15.702 --> 17:16.636
-Oh.
-What?

17:16.703 --> 17:17.970
-Sorry.
-Ah...

17:18.037 --> 17:19.306
(Kathleen chuckles)

17:19.372 --> 17:21.308
You don't look it.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.443
-Boop.
-No...

17:23.510 --> 17:25.178
Back to "Start."

17:27.579 --> 17:30.317
You know, I think you'd be
a wonderful actor.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.052
-Me?
-Yeah.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.954
They're all so afraid
of you on the lot.

17:35.021 --> 17:38.725
Here, you're like a lamb.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.427
One side must be pretend.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.463
A person can't be more
than one thing?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.432
I suppose.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.037
(sighs):
Sometimes, I'm afraid, too.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.606
Of what?

17:53.673 --> 17:55.942
The movie.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.844
Success.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.514
I'm worried that, uh,
something might come between us.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.417
That could never happen.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.256
I'm going to make some tea.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.158
Would you like some?

18:11.224 --> 18:14.093
No. Tea is the past.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.562
I want a hamburger.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.131
(laughs)

18:18.198 --> 18:19.766
I almost forgot.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.534
Hedda Hopper wants
an exclusive with you.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.570
-Oh...
-And your mother.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.405
She's flying a whole team
to Ireland

18:25.472 --> 18:28.141
for photos of your hometown,
all of it.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.809
Wait, you didn't say yes,
did you?

18:29.876 --> 18:31.411
We love the idea.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.814
No.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.549
No, you have to kill it.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.884
Why?

18:37.950 --> 18:39.752
Because it can't happen.

18:39.819 --> 18:40.887
They're my family.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.590
They don't belong to a bunch
of grubby-nosed

18:43.656 --> 18:45.124
movie fans.

18:45.192 --> 18:47.427
All stars have to
do this kind of thing.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.995
It's just part of the job.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.530
-It could be good for you.
-No. No.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.332
It would be terrible
for me, Monroe.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.767
You wouldn't like what you saw.

18:54.834 --> 18:58.104
What would I see?

18:58.171 --> 19:00.807
(sighs)

19:00.873 --> 19:02.409
I don't know how to...

19:02.475 --> 19:03.910
How ugly do you want it?

19:03.976 --> 19:06.846
The drunk mother?

19:06.913 --> 19:08.448
The hoodlum cousins?

19:08.515 --> 19:11.884
The uncle that's in jail?

19:11.951 --> 19:14.254
I mean, I don't talk to them.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.888
Any of them.

19:15.955 --> 19:19.759
It's part of the reason
I was running away.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.762
Please, Monroe,
don't make me do this.

19:22.829 --> 19:23.896
I'm begging you.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.732
Okay.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.302
I'll kill it.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.405
(sighs)

19:33.940 --> 19:36.943
Thank you.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.778
You could have told me all this.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.848
There shouldn't be
any secrets between us.

19:44.651 --> 19:49.889
I don't know,
I guess it was just shame,

19:49.956 --> 19:52.325
or something.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.626
(sniffles)

19:55.795 --> 19:57.964
I think I will take
that cup of tea now.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.333
Okay.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.906
(sighs)

20:52.385 --> 20:53.953
Thought this was your day off.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.388
It is.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.156
I've come to take her home.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.425
Where is she?

20:58.491 --> 21:00.427
Darned if I know.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.295
Desk said she left
last night.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.096
What do you mean left?

21:04.163 --> 21:06.566
Took her things and went.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.968
Well, how can they
let her do that?

21:09.035 --> 21:10.403
I don't know.

21:10.470 --> 21:13.039
I'll check her chart.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.992
If you need any more files,
please be sure

21:33.059 --> 21:34.527
to see me about it.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.295
When things don't go
through my desk,

21:36.363 --> 21:37.864
they often get fouled up.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.237
It's so interesting,
what you do.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.239
Most people don't think so.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.141
That's crazy.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.978
You're like King Solomon.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.946
Oh?

21:54.013 --> 21:58.150
You pore over every cost,
every dollar,

21:58.217 --> 22:01.454
and then you just decide

22:01.521 --> 22:05.525
who stays and who goes.

22:05.592 --> 22:10.463
I don't decide,
I just recommend.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.935
I have some
recommendations, too.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.170
You do?

22:18.237 --> 22:19.506
I hate to say it,

22:19.572 --> 22:23.910
but not everyone
pulls their weight on this ship.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.381
Why don't you get
another cup, Birdy?

22:28.448 --> 22:31.183
We'll talk.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.752
(choir holds final note)

22:32.819 --> 22:34.253
(applause)

22:34.320 --> 22:35.422
(projector clicking)

22:35.488 --> 22:36.823
Thank you.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.692
It's great, Monroe,
but why are we here?

22:39.759 --> 22:41.861
Well, you're here because
you're the five

22:41.928 --> 22:43.463
most important directors
in town.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.465
-(chuckles): Oh.
-And because you all know

22:45.532 --> 22:46.866
that it's not good
for the business

22:46.933 --> 22:49.001
to have the same three
companies gobbling up

22:49.068 --> 22:52.071
all the Oscars every year.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.040
The public loved this picture,

22:54.106 --> 22:56.443
but we can't compete
for votes with Metro,

22:56.509 --> 22:58.411
Columbia, and Warners.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.780
We're not the machine they are.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.082
But imagine a world
where we could.

23:03.149 --> 23:06.553
A world where
all movies were equal.

23:06.619 --> 23:09.088
It'd be better for all of us,
don't you think?

23:09.155 --> 23:10.857
Not bad for you either.

23:10.923 --> 23:11.791
(laughter)

23:11.858 --> 23:14.193
No... no, it wouldn't be.

23:14.260 --> 23:18.097
But one day you may want to
break from Columbia, Frank.

23:18.164 --> 23:21.033
Start your own studio.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.835
When that day comes,
wouldn't you want your films

23:22.902 --> 23:25.538
to compete with Louis Mayer's
films solely on merit?

23:25.605 --> 23:27.039
We're just five people, Monroe.

23:27.106 --> 23:30.843
But between you, you know
every member in the Academy.

23:30.910 --> 23:34.947
You might call them,
encourage them to support us.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.650
For the sake
of competitive balance.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.418
If you think the film is worthy.

23:39.486 --> 23:42.021
-My God, you are good.
-(laughter)

23:42.088 --> 23:43.723
If I were that good,
the five of you

23:43.790 --> 23:46.292
would all be
making pictures here.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.794
Will you help us?

23:49.228 --> 23:50.730
Please.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.232
(choir holds final note)

23:53.299 --> 23:55.134
(applause)

23:55.201 --> 23:56.603
Thank you.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.338
Thank you, gentlemen.

23:59.405 --> 24:00.773
You're here because
you're the five

24:00.840 --> 24:03.543
most important directors
in town.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.212
Hey, Sternberg!

24:07.814 --> 24:10.349
Hedda Hopper's column says
that her favorite picture

24:10.416 --> 24:11.684
of the year is Anthony Adverse.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.286
Anthony Adverse!

24:14.353 --> 24:15.922
Not one word about Angels.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.891
So I call her to lay into her
about welching on our deal.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.126
She says you're the one
who welched.

24:20.192 --> 24:21.494
Stopped her from going
to Ireland.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.830
That's true. I killed it.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.431
Why the hell would you do that?

24:25.498 --> 24:26.899
It would have caused
someone pain.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.068
Instead, I'm the one in pain.
Is that better?

24:29.135 --> 24:31.337
I love her, Pat.

24:31.403 --> 24:32.839
Fine.

24:32.905 --> 24:35.842
But I own her.
For seven pictures worth,

24:35.908 --> 24:37.777
and she's gonna do
whatever the hell I please!

24:37.844 --> 24:39.612
MARY:
Mr. Stahr,

24:39.679 --> 24:41.447
Miss Moore is here
to sign her contract.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.516
Thank you, Mary.
Send her in.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.353
Hedda Hopper isn't the only
arbiter of taste

24:47.419 --> 24:49.922
in this town, you know.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.458
We were just talking
about you.

24:52.525 --> 24:53.826
I heard.

24:53.893 --> 24:56.095
Mr. Brady, I don't know
whether to be flattered

24:56.162 --> 24:57.697
-or terrified.
-(chuckles): Well,

24:57.764 --> 24:58.998
you hang on to a bit of both,

24:59.065 --> 25:00.700
-we'll get along just fine.
-(laughs)

25:00.767 --> 25:02.501
Thought we might get a picture
of the big moment.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.170
Swell.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.775
-BRADY: Thank you, Mary.
-Mm-hmm.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.747
Allow me.

25:15.748 --> 25:17.584
There we are.

25:25.558 --> 25:27.159
There you are, sir.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.461
My promise to work hard
for Brady-American.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.863
Well, that's just fine.
(chuckles)

25:30.930 --> 25:35.134
Promises are precious things.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.969
-MAN: Over here, please.
-(Kathleen clears throat)

25:37.036 --> 25:39.305
Big smiles now.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.840
-Oh.
-(laughs)

25:40.907 --> 25:43.542
This lighting scheme
will be all wrong.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.044
Entirely.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.580
Since when are we making
a romantic comedy?

25:47.647 --> 25:49.816
You said you wanted shadows
and light.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.018
I said I wanted terror.

25:55.855 --> 25:57.690
CELIA:
It's lunchtime, Fritz.

25:57.757 --> 25:59.792
LANG: We will work
through lunch today.

25:59.859 --> 26:02.061
I will say
when it is time to eat.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.265
Thank you, everybody.
That's lunch.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.967
See you in an hour.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.739
(door opens)

26:15.174 --> 26:17.644
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

26:17.710 --> 26:20.747
Nobody gives orders
on my set but me.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.214
But this isn't your set.

26:22.281 --> 26:23.549
It's mine.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.417
Is that so?

26:25.484 --> 26:26.786
Mm-hmm.

26:26.853 --> 26:29.989
You're just angry at me,
aren't you,

26:30.056 --> 26:32.358
for my little presumption
with you.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.525
(laughs)

26:33.592 --> 26:34.727
That?

26:34.794 --> 26:36.829
That was a hundred years ago.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.365
I barely remember it.

26:41.467 --> 26:43.535
Would you come with me, please?

26:43.602 --> 26:44.871
What?

26:44.937 --> 26:47.940
Something I'd like to show you.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.089
LANG: You wanted to show me
a men's toilet?

27:03.155 --> 27:05.825
CELIA:
I grew up on this lot.

27:05.892 --> 27:08.294
Saw all kinds of things here.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.563
You know what used to happen
right behind that bathroom door?

27:11.630 --> 27:13.332
I can't imagine.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.134
It's where Fred Astaire would go

27:15.201 --> 27:17.670
before shooting
every dance number he ever did.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.471
To throw up.

27:19.538 --> 27:21.340
Yes. How charming.

27:21.407 --> 27:22.742
It was, actually.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.276
In its own way.

27:24.343 --> 27:27.646
See, he was terrified
that he would fail.

27:27.714 --> 27:30.082
Just like you're terrified.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.719
Only difference is, you tend
to throw up on other people,

27:32.785 --> 27:35.888
which seems ungenerous to me.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.024
He'd walk out of that bathroom,
and onto the stage,

27:38.090 --> 27:41.928
and give the world the finest
dance numbers it will ever see.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.896
Just like you're going to direct

27:43.963 --> 27:46.899
the best picture
this studio has ever made.

27:46.966 --> 27:51.237
Not despite your fear,
but because of it.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.507
Is it the language
that's unnerving you?

27:55.574 --> 27:59.979
I'd certainly hate to have to
direct a picture in German.

28:00.046 --> 28:03.449
-But Fritz, you...
-40 days.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.683
Hmm?

28:04.751 --> 28:07.619
He gave me 40 days
to direct a film

28:07.686 --> 28:11.557
that in Germany, I would have
got 80 days to make.

28:11.623 --> 28:14.026
How can I do it?

28:14.093 --> 28:16.328
You can.

28:16.395 --> 28:17.997
And you will.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.732
We'll do it together.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.735
You are a child.

28:22.802 --> 28:25.237
Maybe so.

28:25.304 --> 28:30.042
But you don't see me throwing
tantrums around the crew.

28:41.420 --> 28:44.156
(car door closes)

28:44.223 --> 28:46.225
Miner.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.765
I was just looking for you.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.466
Oh?

28:54.533 --> 28:56.769
You know this man?

28:56.836 --> 28:58.437
(muffled grunting)

28:58.504 --> 29:01.240
He stole a struck from us.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.342
No. No, I don't.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.643
He says you do.

29:04.710 --> 29:07.914
He says you let him on the lot.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.782
MINER:
Sir.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.650
You have to believe me,
I didn't...

29:11.717 --> 29:14.120
You didn't what?

29:18.457 --> 29:22.528
Think about the job
Mr. Brady had given you?

29:22.594 --> 29:23.863
Hmm?

29:23.930 --> 29:26.298
Think about your little brother
and sister,

29:26.365 --> 29:31.003
and where they might live if you
were sent off to some tiny cell?

29:33.973 --> 29:35.374
Please. Please,
I didn't... I didn't know...

29:35.441 --> 29:39.545
You let a stranger
inside our gate, did you not?

29:41.213 --> 29:42.882
(sniffles)
Yeah, I, uh...

29:42.949 --> 29:44.716
Stop it, Miner.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.785
Now, listen.

29:46.853 --> 29:49.021
I'm not gonna squeal.

29:49.088 --> 29:51.323
I'm just gonna put you to work.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.325
I mean, real work.

29:56.162 --> 29:58.097
W-What does that mean?

29:58.164 --> 30:02.401
It means
you're no longer an office boy.

30:06.873 --> 30:09.008
(exhales)

30:14.313 --> 30:15.882
Mm?

30:21.253 --> 30:22.721
Mary.

30:22.788 --> 30:24.356
What is it?

30:24.423 --> 30:26.692
Mr. Brady's on hold
with the Academy.

30:26.758 --> 30:28.527
The nominations.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.529
They don't announce until 4:00.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.731
It's Mr. Capra himself.

30:32.798 --> 30:34.300
All right.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.140
Uh-huh.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.845
Yes. Thanks.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.580
Capra?

30:51.683 --> 30:53.052
It was.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.620
(exhales sharply)

30:57.323 --> 30:59.191
Angels got six nominations.

30:59.258 --> 31:02.294
-Including Best Picture.
-(laughs)

31:02.361 --> 31:05.031
And Minna got one, too,
for Downing Street.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.832
Oh, my God.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.367
Pat.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.502
I can't decide who gets my first
"go fuck yourself" call,

31:10.569 --> 31:11.870
Mayer or Hedda Hopper.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.872
(Brady laughs)

31:13.940 --> 31:17.043
But it is momentous.

31:17.109 --> 31:18.777
One day,
when I'm less angry at you,

31:18.844 --> 31:21.613
we'll drink a toast
or something.

31:21.680 --> 31:24.516
We rise and fall together.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.452
There you go again:
false humility.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.120
You ever gonna stop
being Monroe Stahr?

31:28.187 --> 31:31.223
-You invented me, remember?
-How can I forget?

31:31.290 --> 31:33.159
It'll probably be
the first line in my obituary.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.693
Saved me from a life
in the circus.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.195
Okay, give me a second.

31:36.262 --> 31:39.598
I'm imagining you
being eaten by lions.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.234
I look forward to that drink.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.405
BIRDY:
Mr. Brady's office.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.107
(phones ringing)

31:48.174 --> 31:50.309
FELICITY:
Mr. Stahr's office.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.079
Mr. Brady's office.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.281
(phones continue ringing)

31:55.347 --> 31:57.016
MARY:
The whole world is calling

31:57.083 --> 31:58.951
to congratulate you, Mr. Stahr.

31:59.018 --> 32:00.152
(exhales)

32:00.219 --> 32:01.520
Send them through.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.722
Yes, sir.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.624
I was just...

32:07.093 --> 32:10.662
...thinking about
when I started here.

32:10.729 --> 32:14.033
Seven years ago.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.102
You sat me down and you told me

32:16.168 --> 32:17.636
what you wanted
this place to be.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.072
The kind of pictures
you wanted to make,

32:20.139 --> 32:22.674
what you wanted people
to say about them.

32:22.741 --> 32:25.044
And you did it.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.745
Everything that you planned.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.614
Not everything.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.781
Not yet.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.283
Mr. Stahr.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.885
There are too many bad days
in this business

32:33.952 --> 32:36.055
not to celebrate the good ones.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.523
You did it.

32:39.825 --> 32:42.028
Thank you, Mary.

32:51.937 --> 32:53.405
(knocking at door)

33:03.615 --> 33:05.451
Es tut mir leid.

33:05.517 --> 33:09.988
Is that German for
"I find jealousy unattractive"?

33:11.923 --> 33:14.593
It's German for "I am sorry."

33:15.827 --> 33:18.997
I should not have allowed that.

33:33.812 --> 33:36.715
Good night, you two.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.088
(door closes)

33:43.755 --> 33:46.592
And you?

33:46.658 --> 33:48.194
Where's my "es tut"?

33:48.260 --> 33:50.162
I don't apologize.

33:50.229 --> 33:51.730
It's not in my nature.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.801
Oh, Fritz.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.670
Now I'm going to have to learn
the German word for "asshole."

34:01.240 --> 34:05.344
By the way, I looked it up.

34:05.411 --> 34:08.813
Fred Astaire never shot
a picture on this lot.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.618
Hmm.

34:12.684 --> 34:15.587
(phone rings)

34:15.654 --> 34:19.091
This is Celia.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.627
I'll be right there, Daddy.

34:23.529 --> 34:27.599
(big band music playing)

34:27.666 --> 34:29.601
(laughs)

34:35.306 --> 34:36.608
(cork pops)
Ooh!

34:36.675 --> 34:39.210
(all cheering)

34:39.277 --> 34:41.913
I'd like to thank you,
all of you,

34:41.980 --> 34:47.518
for your loyalty, your hard work
and... your forgiveness.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.788
Last week, Hedda Hopper said

34:49.855 --> 34:52.524
that we were
the little studio that could.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.260
Well, we could.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.594
And today we did!

34:55.661 --> 34:57.463
-(whooping)
-Hear, hear!

34:57.529 --> 35:01.867
And here's to Monroe,
Master of the Reshoot.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.602
Thank God.

35:07.206 --> 35:09.608
* *

35:12.278 --> 35:13.945
Can I see you, Mr. Brady?

35:14.012 --> 35:15.781
Kind of busy, Ringler.

35:15.847 --> 35:16.948
Can it wait?

35:17.015 --> 35:19.318
No, I don't think so.

35:19.385 --> 35:21.687
The board is awaiting
my report, sir.

35:21.753 --> 35:27.393
* A little jitterbug
looking for a place to jive. *

35:31.697 --> 35:34.833
So, how does it feel
to be nominated?

35:34.900 --> 35:37.669
For a script I didn't write?
Wonderful.

35:37.736 --> 35:38.937
Now, George.

35:39.004 --> 35:42.040
I left a lot of what you wrote
in there. (laughs)

35:42.107 --> 35:44.843
And you know, Monroe never makes
a movie from start to finish

35:44.910 --> 35:46.445
with just one writer.

35:46.512 --> 35:49.014
Oh, God. That mean I have to
start looking over my shoulder?

35:49.080 --> 35:52.618
It is hell working for a guy
who's smarter than his writers.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.820
Monroe doesn't think
he's smarter than we are,

35:54.886 --> 35:57.256
he just thinks
our brains belong to him,

35:57.323 --> 35:59.558
because only he knows
how to use them.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.693
I would be lost without you.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.028
I know that.

36:03.094 --> 36:04.496
HACKETT:
Jesus.

36:04.563 --> 36:08.200
Maybe he will
start a revolution.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.704
"Ned.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.740
"George Boxley.

36:14.806 --> 36:15.774
Felicity."

36:15.841 --> 36:19.845
You don't think
this is a bit draconian?

36:19.911 --> 36:21.146
I think it's generous.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.249
You got me firing
over 300 people

36:23.315 --> 36:24.850
and selling off my back lot.

36:24.916 --> 36:27.853
Real estate in this city is
beginning to show actual value.

36:27.919 --> 36:30.188
It's not real estate, it's
my lot, where I make my movies.

36:30.256 --> 36:33.325
It's an asset,
and you're in debt.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.926
So you shoot everything
on stages.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.428
Some of the people on this list

36:36.495 --> 36:38.530
are in that very room,
celebrating.

36:38.597 --> 36:41.132
Didn't you slash their salaries
just last week?

36:41.199 --> 36:43.969
It's not the same thing
as firing them.

36:45.704 --> 36:49.908
Just leave your goddamn list and
get the hell out of my office.

36:51.877 --> 36:55.514
("King Conga"
by Dennis Farnon playing)

37:02.621 --> 37:05.657
(laughs)

37:05.724 --> 37:07.859
I almost forgot.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.728
I got you something today.

37:09.795 --> 37:11.297
(gasps)

37:11.363 --> 37:13.131
I should be
getting you something.

37:13.198 --> 37:15.567
No. Open it.

37:15.634 --> 37:16.702
Oh...

37:18.704 --> 37:20.306
Oh!

37:20.372 --> 37:23.309
Oh, it's beautiful.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.043
Next time you feel like all this

37:25.110 --> 37:27.546
is too much, or... you're scared

37:27.613 --> 37:30.849
about anything at all,
you just...

37:30.916 --> 37:33.585
-(laughs)
-...and I'll come running.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.562
Aw.

37:43.629 --> 37:47.299
KAY: I think I'm gonna go home
and sock my husband in the nose.

37:55.507 --> 37:59.177
(woman squeals, laughs)

37:59.244 --> 38:01.547
No, thanks, Felicity.
You have it.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.223
Still want me to find

38:12.290 --> 38:14.426
another business, Daddy?
(chuckles)

38:16.795 --> 38:18.764
Daddy?

38:18.830 --> 38:20.766
More than ever.

38:22.868 --> 38:23.969
* *

38:24.035 --> 38:24.970
Ah!

38:36.081 --> 38:37.616
Rose?

38:39.985 --> 38:42.421
I see our parlor
is almost a parlor again.

38:42.488 --> 38:44.856
Yep. Everything back to normal.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.558
Thank you.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.293
I appreciate you
coming around on this one.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.895
Hmm.

38:49.961 --> 38:54.099
I started thinking about
the sacrifice you'd be making,

38:54.165 --> 38:57.335
the, uh, crossword and all, and
I just couldn't do it to you.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.074
Got two huge
pieces of news today.

39:06.412 --> 39:09.180
She just left the hospital.

39:09.247 --> 39:11.617
Just... walked out.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.854
She's a grown woman;
it's her right.

39:18.624 --> 39:20.426
Don't you want to
hear about my day?

39:20.492 --> 39:21.927
It was a big one.

39:29.167 --> 39:32.671
God, you don't see me at all.

39:32.738 --> 39:33.672
Do you?

39:33.739 --> 39:36.675
I see you have all this.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.577
And it's still
not enough for you.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.415
Would it be enough for you?

39:43.482 --> 39:45.717
No, but I'm a man.

39:54.392 --> 39:59.030
Not that it matters, but I got
seven Oscar nominations today.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.433
And I was told I have to
fire 300 people

40:01.500 --> 40:02.968
and sell off my back lot.

40:03.034 --> 40:06.371
Congratulations.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.640
And I'm sorry.

40:08.707 --> 40:11.743
May you get all of the praise,
and none of the blame.

40:14.379 --> 40:15.781
That's it?

40:17.048 --> 40:18.584
(sighs)

40:18.650 --> 40:21.319
Do you need more?

40:21.386 --> 40:22.888
I thought you were a man.

40:22.954 --> 40:27.125
* *

40:56.988 --> 40:58.924
* *

41:06.464 --> 41:08.233
(sighs)

41:13.905 --> 41:16.508
(knocks)

41:16.575 --> 41:19.477
Congratulations, Monroe.

41:19.545 --> 41:21.446
Thanks, Tom.

41:21.513 --> 41:25.884
Off to celebrate
with your fiancÃ©e?

41:25.951 --> 41:28.353
Not that it's any
of your concern.

41:28.419 --> 41:31.657
Oh, it is my concern.

41:31.723 --> 41:33.391
Now that she belongs
to this studio,

41:33.458 --> 41:36.094
it's even very much my concern.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.296
Hmm.

41:38.363 --> 41:40.532
For instance, when she gets
a bruise on her face

41:40.599 --> 41:44.570
and I know it didn't come from

41:44.636 --> 41:46.605
a piece of falling luggage,

41:46.672 --> 41:49.074
I have to investigate, you know?

41:52.944 --> 41:55.113
Want a laugh?
(chuckles)

41:55.180 --> 41:57.215
For a second,
I thought maybe you hit her.

41:57.282 --> 41:59.050
Huh.

41:59.117 --> 42:02.688
But then I started
having her followed.

42:02.754 --> 42:05.591
Which turned out to be
a good idea. Know why?

42:06.692 --> 42:08.694
Maybe you should
just get to the point.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.629
'Cause she's with Rupert Vajna.

42:10.696 --> 42:13.464
In his house.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.602
My deputy just saw her go in.

42:16.668 --> 42:19.204
Well, your deputy is wrong.

42:19.270 --> 42:22.507
She doesn't even know Vajna.

42:22.574 --> 42:24.109
I'm afraid she does.

42:49.167 --> 42:52.137
I don't understand.

42:52.203 --> 42:55.340
I wanted to be
generous with you.

42:55.406 --> 42:56.507
It's...

42:56.574 --> 42:58.143
it's too generous.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.478
My commission on your first
month's salary should be...

43:00.545 --> 43:04.683
Rupert, it is
my first month's salary.

43:04.750 --> 43:07.152
I asked for an advance.

43:07.218 --> 43:08.553
It's also good-bye.

43:08.620 --> 43:12.423
If you want another month,
if you want another six months,

43:12.490 --> 43:14.225
you can have that, too.

43:14.292 --> 43:19.530
But you and I are never
going to see one another again.

43:19.597 --> 43:20.966
Do you understand?

43:23.368 --> 43:26.204
Good-bye, huh?

43:26.271 --> 43:27.906
I'm sorry.

43:31.509 --> 43:33.278
I love him.

43:36.081 --> 43:38.616
I can't continue to live a lie.

43:46.925 --> 43:49.895
You... had nothing.

43:49.961 --> 43:54.165
And I gave you... everything.

43:54.232 --> 43:56.935
I know.

43:57.002 --> 43:58.336
Just take the money.

43:58.403 --> 44:01.973
The money's not the point!

44:02.040 --> 44:04.575
Don't you have
any feelings at all?

44:04.642 --> 44:05.977
Of course I do.

44:06.044 --> 44:07.512
Or-or were you just conning me,

44:07.578 --> 44:08.947
-like you conned him?
-No, no...

44:09.014 --> 44:10.916
I was useful for a while,
then it's,

44:10.982 --> 44:13.451
-"So long, sucker."
-Rupert, please.

44:13.518 --> 44:15.453
-Please, try to understand...
-Oh, no, no.

44:15.520 --> 44:17.856
-Of course not!
-No, no, please!

44:17.923 --> 44:19.257
-(yells) Ow!
-Would you listen to me?

44:19.324 --> 44:21.359
-Aren't you listening to me?
-Get off me!

44:22.660 --> 44:24.529
VAJNA:
Where you going?

44:24.595 --> 44:25.931
(grunts)

44:30.001 --> 44:31.602
(necklace clatters)

44:31.669 --> 44:33.338
(Vajna grunts, Kathleen screams)

44:33.404 --> 44:36.107
(Kathleen groaning)

44:41.813 --> 44:44.415
-(choking) -What are you
so scared of, kiddo?

44:44.482 --> 44:47.152
I would never let you go.

44:47.218 --> 44:49.620
(chuckles)
But maybe I should.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.422
(Vajna groans)

44:51.489 --> 44:53.424
-(Kathleen yells)
-Ah!

44:53.491 --> 44:55.126
Oh.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.128
(panting)

45:03.134 --> 45:04.803
* *

45:26.491 --> 45:27.692
Kathleen!

45:27.759 --> 45:29.928
(with Irish accent):
Monroe?

45:29.995 --> 45:31.863
STAHR: What the hell
are you doing here?

45:31.930 --> 45:34.199
He attacked me.

45:34.265 --> 45:36.234
Monroe, I'm gonna
tell you everything.

45:36.301 --> 45:39.570
But first,
do you know that I love you?

45:39.637 --> 45:41.472
Do you know?

45:41.539 --> 45:42.673
Yes.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.710
Okay.
(panting and sniffling)

45:45.777 --> 45:48.513
Imagine a girl
getting off a bus.

45:48.579 --> 45:51.316
She wants to be an actress.

45:53.184 --> 45:57.688
She meets a guy, a manager.

45:57.755 --> 46:00.491
-What...? -He used to work
for Minna Davis, he says.

46:00.558 --> 46:02.427
-Why are you talking like that?
-He has an idea.

46:02.493 --> 46:04.095
He says if she can do it,

46:04.162 --> 46:07.232
says if she can
do an Irish accent...

46:07.298 --> 46:08.967
(with American accent):
...he'll find her a job

46:09.034 --> 46:10.836
near Brady-American Studios,
and...

46:10.902 --> 46:13.338
and she'll catch the ear
of the guy who runs it.

46:13.404 --> 46:14.539
And he'll cast her.

46:14.605 --> 46:15.773
(mumbles indistinctly)

46:15.841 --> 46:18.376
-And she'll survive. -I need you
to stop talking for a second.

46:18.443 --> 46:19.945
It wasn't a very good plan,
because...

46:20.011 --> 46:22.047
Enough! Enough.

46:25.650 --> 46:27.652
...I fell in love with you.

46:27.718 --> 46:29.454
It was all a lie.

46:29.520 --> 46:31.622
No! No, just the voice.

46:31.689 --> 46:34.525
Monroe, I came here tonight
to tell him good-bye!

46:34.592 --> 46:35.861
Oh, I'm sorry.

46:35.927 --> 46:39.664
-Don't. Don't.
-Sorry.

46:39.730 --> 46:41.199
Thank you for telling me.

46:41.266 --> 46:44.135
-I'll see you on the set.
-No, please.

46:44.202 --> 46:46.972
-Don't go. Monroe!
-What's there to stay for?

46:47.038 --> 46:48.273
I love you!

46:48.339 --> 46:49.908
-I love you.
-Let him go.

46:49.975 --> 46:52.677
-Monroe. Monroe.
-She's mine. See?

46:52.743 --> 46:54.179
Good.

46:54.245 --> 46:55.413
Good, you two
deserve each other.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.148
No, I don't want him,
I want you!

46:57.215 --> 47:00.986
You cost me Minna! You're not
gonna do it to me twice.

47:03.521 --> 47:06.524
Well, congratulations.

47:06.591 --> 47:08.159
Hell of a con.

47:08.226 --> 47:09.594
-No, no.
-(chuckles)

47:09.660 --> 47:11.062
It was easy.

47:11.129 --> 47:13.098
I just taught her an accent,
you did the rest,

47:13.164 --> 47:14.565
as I knew you would.

47:14.632 --> 47:18.169
I tried to warn you, honey,
he didn't love you.

47:18.236 --> 47:20.471
-He can't love anything.
-That's not true.

47:20.538 --> 47:23.574
The nearest he ever came to it
was Minna, and he killed her.

47:23.641 --> 47:25.510
You son of a bitch!

47:25.576 --> 47:27.012
(Kathleen gasps)

47:27.078 --> 47:28.513
(both grunting)

47:28.579 --> 47:29.948
Monroe, he's crazy!

47:42.560 --> 47:43.328
KATHLEEN:
No!

47:43.394 --> 47:44.829
-Oh!
-(Kathleen screams)

47:44.896 --> 47:46.297
STAHR:
No!

48:00.545 --> 48:02.480
(both panting)

48:20.131 --> 48:22.333
And you are actually from?

48:25.870 --> 48:28.139
(softly):
Wisconsin.

48:30.908 --> 48:33.111
I have to make a phone call.

48:33.178 --> 48:36.581
(Kathleen crying)

48:42.720 --> 48:44.189
(whimpers)

48:54.699 --> 48:59.604
(door opens, closes)

48:59.670 --> 49:02.073
(footfalls approaching)

49:14.585 --> 49:16.054
This never happened.

49:18.289 --> 49:20.691
Neither of you were ever here.

49:23.128 --> 49:25.130
Now let me do my work.

49:25.196 --> 49:27.665
(bag drops on floor)

49:27.732 --> 49:30.601
No one can know, Tom.

49:30.668 --> 49:31.969
No one.

49:34.005 --> 49:36.707
SZEP:
As I said, it never happened.

49:38.009 --> 49:40.045
He will disappear tonight.

49:46.351 --> 49:48.686
Now go, both of you.

49:48.753 --> 49:50.655
Separately.

50:20.751 --> 50:22.920
* *

50:22.987 --> 50:24.789
(door opens)

50:24.855 --> 50:26.591
(door closes)

50:29.026 --> 50:30.361
Go.

50:36.067 --> 50:39.237
(door opens, closes)

50:52.717 --> 50:54.152
