- Kind of.

No, you look great.
You know he got done for drink-driving?

Tell your smart-arse boyfriend it was
four pints of lager, 15 bloody years ago.

03:12.940 --> 03:15.408

Mmm. Classy.

Test me.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.616
This has gotta be a wind-up.

03:49.700 --> 03:52.214
- What's wrong?
- It's from the school.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.972
Cheeky bastards.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.009
So what do you reckon, Lip?

04:09.100 --> 04:13.139
We could say Dad's lost the plot
so a home visit's a bit awkward.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.212
We could say Dad's drank the plot.

04:16.300 --> 04:19.132
Oh, God.
Dad's gonna have to do the honours.

04:19.220 --> 04:21.858
What? Some of us
wanna go to sixth form, you know.

04:21.940 --> 04:24.773
And he's the one they wanna see,
to tick their boxes.

04:24.860 --> 04:27.693
So if you wanna go to sixth form,
make sure Dad goes.

04:27.780 --> 04:31.534
- Didn't know you cared.
- Course I care about your future.

04:31.620 --> 04:34.453
You're my pension!

So if you don't turn up at school,
some teacher turns up at your door?

04:38.380 --> 04:39.654
- Yep.
- Blimey.

04:39.740 --> 04:43.892
You've no chance then. You'll have to
stick some tape over Frank's gob

04:43.980 --> 04:47.609
- and make him play dad for the night.
- That's the plan.

04:47.700 --> 04:51.249
That place was a right shit heap
when we went. What's happened?

04:51.340 --> 04:54.810
Dunno. They reckon
there's too much parent apathy.

04:54.900 --> 04:59.496
- Hammersley's been promoted to head.
- Hammersley?

04:59.580 --> 05:01.935
- Christ on a bike.
- Don't.

05:02.020 --> 05:04.580
At least Lip's doing all right.

05:04.660 --> 05:06.616
He's a bloody genius, that kid.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.816
Oh, is it nearly time?

05:08.900 --> 05:11.368
Er, less than a minute.

05:11.460 --> 05:13.735

somewhere. Help her, Frank.

carrying on with each other,

09:19.180 --> 09:22.968

with their BA (Honours).

09:23.060 --> 09:25.096
BA? Bloody Arrogant.

09:25.180 --> 09:28.775

- If communism's so great

09:28.860 --> 09:33.012

jars of coffee, with their names on?

- When is it?
- A week Sunday, but it'll be sold out.

Yeah, and they'll be able to

- Yeah.

11:13.860 --> 11:15.816
Oh, shit.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.936
We've still got the stockroom.

11:19.020 --> 11:23.298

- It's the Emerald Isle.

12:05.620 --> 12:08.851

It's the most northerly part
of the mainland.

Smashing.

12:17.060 --> 12:18.778
Frank, l'd love us to go.

12:18.860 --> 12:21.454
Then go we shall.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.496
Me. You. Karen.

12:24.820 --> 12:26.538
She could share the driving.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.815
Yeah...

12:28.900 --> 12:31.733
That's the beauty of CCTV. Shoplifters...

12:31.820 --> 12:34.414
I'm such a tool. I didn't think about it.

12:34.500 --> 12:38.049
Save on groceries and condoms.
Do you get a discount?

12:38.140 --> 12:40.449
You think you're so funny. You're not.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.451
The thing is, Sheila, it's like...

12:45.540 --> 12:50.819
I'm allergic to school. We all have
our little phobias and school's mine.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.494
l just hoped
that you might do it for Karen.

12:55.780 --> 12:59.739
It's not like these things
are all about the kiddies, is it?

12:59.820 --> 13:03.699
These days, it's all league tables and PR,
spin and PR.

13:03.780 --> 13:06.613
l could really do with someone
to hold me hand.

13:06.700 --> 13:10.249
Hear that?
You've been like a father to her recently.

13:10.340 --> 13:15.016
You've earned the right
to go along tonight - in loco parentis -

13:15.100 --> 13:17.056
- for me and Eddie.
- Look.

13:17.140 --> 13:21.850
l've just told me own kids to go swivel.
For God's sake!

13:21.940 --> 13:25.296
(Sheila, sobbing) If I could go myself...

13:25.380 --> 13:27.769
You do know that, don't you, love?

13:31.580 --> 13:33.536
(Frank) Jesus wept.

13:33.620 --> 13:36.532
You are so coming tonight, Frank.

13:36.620 --> 13:39.054

for a couple of hours

13:39.140 --> 13:42.450

She's got this knack.

13:49.100 --> 13:51.694
Always getting the truth out of me.

13:56.940 --> 13:59.693
And we wouldn't want that, now,
would we?

14:12.380 --> 14:14.974
Yeah, just a bit... A little bit back...

14:15.060 --> 14:16.732
Yeah. Stop, stop, stop.

14:16.820 --> 14:18.492
Try that.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.536
'Check this.

14:24.620 --> 14:27.737
'Can you see Shag Valley?
Get down here now.'

14:28.820 --> 14:31.971
We are home and dry.

15:01.060 --> 15:03.938
And where did you two spring from?

15:04.020 --> 15:06.250
Oh, come on. We're gonna be late.

15:26.460 --> 15:29.816
Hiya. Here for your session
with agoraphobic Annie?

15:29.900 --> 15:32.573
- Are we ready for the off?
- Raring to go!

15:32.660 --> 15:35.333
- Don't let her spend too much.
- Come on!

15:35.420 --> 15:37.376
Good luck!

15:37.460 --> 15:40.975
- Parents' evening.
- Time for a little retail therapy.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.815
- Frank, you need to sign in.
- Eh?

15:52.900 --> 15:54.538
Oh. Righty-oh.

16:00.740 --> 16:02.696
Did you know about this?

16:03.740 --> 16:05.696
(Lip) What's he doing here?

16:08.660 --> 16:11.777
- What you brought him for?
- What the hell are you doin' here?

16:11.860 --> 16:15.250
I'm here for Karen - loco parentis.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.331
- Et tu, Brute?
- No offence, Karen.

16:17.420 --> 16:20.378
We said you couldn't come
because you were in hospital.

16:20.460 --> 16:23.372
- That's a fucking horrible thing to say!
- Shhh.

16:23.460 --> 16:26.258
Don't go tempting fate, you!

16:26.340 --> 16:28.979
- Hospital? With what?
- (lan) Liver dysfunction.

16:29.060 --> 16:31.016
We knew they'd buy that.

16:31.100 --> 16:33.455
No, look. They don't know him anyway.

16:33.540 --> 16:36.498
- Unless he'd been when you were here.
- (Fiona) Never.

16:36.580 --> 16:39.652
And he's never been
while me and lan have been here.

16:39.740 --> 16:44.894
Hey, I'm all she's got
cos her dad fucked... Remember?

16:44.980 --> 16:49.098
That's what gets me about you lot.
Generosity. Me, me, me.

16:49.180 --> 16:53.298
The show is on the road.
Point us at the first one, sweetheart.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.336
Erm, chemistry's free.

16:57.420 --> 16:59.570
I'm sorry. Am I... Am I early

16:59.660 --> 17:01.696
or late? Eh?

17:07.980 --> 17:13.179
- Oh! Dicky wheel on the trolley.
- Swap it for a new one by the doors.

17:13.260 --> 17:16.297
No, l... This one's fine, thanks.

17:16.380 --> 17:18.894
l'll be right beside you.

17:23.780 --> 17:25.816
- (Bleeping)
- I can't.

17:25.900 --> 17:28.050
- Sure?
- Sorry, I can't.

17:28.140 --> 17:31.098
OK, tell you what.
Let's start in the drinks aisle.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.330
Oh, a drink. Yes, please.

17:35.780 --> 17:38.738
(Sighing nervously)

17:38.820 --> 17:40.492
- (Bleeping)
- Oh!

17:40.580 --> 17:44.334
With respect, this is a parents' evening
and you're a sibling.

17:44.420 --> 17:48.777
- I'm a guardian while Dad's in hospital.
- l've made the rule.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.215
Home visit.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.768
What if Dad doesn't get out?
lt is possible.

17:53.860 --> 17:56.374
Oh, we're a doctor now, Phillip?

17:56.460 --> 17:58.132
No.

17:58.220 --> 18:00.051
But he is.

18:04.660 --> 18:07.777
Steven McBride. I'm Fiona's husband...

18:07.860 --> 18:11.057
to be. Mr Hammersley, I don't get it.

18:11.140 --> 18:15.019
If Lip... Phillip wants to sit history
and he's good at history,

18:15.100 --> 18:17.170
what's to gain from stopping him?

18:17.260 --> 18:22.175
Higher grades all round and a much
more pleasant teaching experience.

18:22.260 --> 18:26.094
- (Fiona) What did he get in his mocks?
- He was lucky. Above average.

18:26.180 --> 18:28.375
- 92%/%.
- While his grades spiral

18:28.460 --> 18:30.576
the others will plummet!

18:30.660 --> 18:32.412
- He's disruptive.
- I'm not.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.297
- Contradictory.
- I'm not!

18:34.380 --> 18:37.929
- Shurrup, Lip.
- (Steven) Can he and I have a moment?

18:38.020 --> 18:41.490
- If things are being said, I wanna hear.
- Fiona....

18:41.580 --> 18:43.536
Come on, you.

18:48.100 --> 18:51.979
- Look, I know what you're thinking.
- No, you don't.

18:52.060 --> 18:53.891
Smart-arsed little fucker?

18:54.980 --> 18:57.050
Much, much worse than that.

18:58.140 --> 19:00.210
Look, do you smoke?

19:06.700 --> 19:08.736
How long you got left in the job?

19:09.820 --> 19:13.051
72 and a half weeks.

19:15.140 --> 19:17.813
Phillip's a keen lad.

19:17.900 --> 19:21.495
- He wants to be an architect.
- He's a twat. They all are.

19:21.580 --> 19:24.253
Kids, staff, parents...

19:24.340 --> 19:26.615
- No offence.
- None taken.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.213
You're not having one?

19:29.300 --> 19:33.578
No, I try not to use that stuff
when I'm... when I'm working.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.172
Jesus Christ!

19:38.260 --> 19:40.216
Cos it was massive, this thing.

19:40.300 --> 19:44.293
See, I know for a fact that Pb is lead,
T is tin, Z is zinc.

19:44.380 --> 19:47.770
You had to know that
to work at Hanson's steelyard.

19:47.860 --> 19:52.092
I worked there till it shut down -
well, no, I left just before -

19:52.180 --> 19:55.411
but you had to be shit-hot at chemistry,
you know.

19:55.500 --> 19:59.937
Yeah. Never a truer word said.
lf you can read this, tell the teacher.

20:00.020 --> 20:03.217
- Thank your teacher.
- Thank your teacher.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.336
- A lottery ticket?
- Not today.

20:05.420 --> 20:08.969
- Packet of fags for Frank?
- No, l'd rather pay.

20:09.060 --> 20:13.975
Where's your sense of adventure,
Sheila? Come on, let's give it a try.

20:15.060 --> 20:18.609
Past the fruit and veg.
Past the carnations...

20:18.700 --> 20:21.737
- It's too near the doors.
- You're doing great.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.776
Through the doors!

20:24.860 --> 20:28.057
- You're fine. Look, we're here already.
- It's too near!

20:28.140 --> 20:31.576
Now, just the one ticket
or shall we get a scratchcard?

20:33.060 --> 20:36.370
The doors! I told you to turn at the doors.

20:38.780 --> 20:43.217
Year zero, Gallagher.
Clean sheet - no pun intended.

20:46.340 --> 20:49.298
- You mean he can do history?
- He can do what he wants.

20:49.380 --> 20:52.292
And you won't shaft me
with the course work?

20:52.380 --> 20:54.610
Me? Get us a gun, Tintin.

20:57.220 --> 21:00.178
(Hammersley giggles uncontrollably)

21:09.780 --> 21:12.852
- What's Steve said to him?
- How should I know?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.896
What's all that about?

21:17.140 --> 21:20.689
To gain strength,
you must sometimes show weakness.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.578
- What you on about?
- I told him he still wets the bed.

21:23.660 --> 21:25.730
He thinks he's got something on you.

21:25.820 --> 21:30.416
- Where's the bogs, by the way?
- Down there. Second right.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.776
ls he serious? Pissin' the bed at my age?

21:33.860 --> 21:36.818
Ahhhh. A lot of people do.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.055
Pssssss...

21:42.060 --> 21:45.370
(Low grunting)

21:47.500 --> 21:49.968
(Giggling)

22:15.420 --> 22:17.695
- Hey, we can't...
- Oh, we can!

22:21.060 --> 22:24.769
- Are you serious?
- Toilets are blocked, mate. Come on.

22:24.860 --> 22:27.693
Hammersley's gonna literally
take the piss.

22:27.780 --> 22:32.934
That's the only fact in life we really
need to get used to - people can and will.

22:41.140 --> 22:43.176
- Here y'are, Stevo.
- Cheers.

22:43.260 --> 22:46.775
- Pint, Kev.
- Frankie, you're gettin' later and later.

22:46.860 --> 22:49.135
lt must be all those home comforts.

22:50.460 --> 22:52.815
Yeah, Karen's had him up the school.

22:52.900 --> 22:54.970
And a packet of dry roasted, Kev.

22:55.060 --> 22:58.894
- He smells bad as well.
- Sticks and stones...

22:58.980 --> 23:01.574
How did you get on with the teachers,
Frank?

23:01.660 --> 23:05.130
Total waste of time.
Bits o' kids teaching bits o' kids.

23:05.220 --> 23:07.529
How long you been fucking Karen for?

23:08.620 --> 23:10.292
Eh?

23:10.380 --> 23:13.133
Sorry.
Mum always tells me off for mumbling.

23:13.220 --> 23:16.018
l said, ''How long
you been fucking Karen for?''

23:16.100 --> 23:19.251
l don't know
what you're bloody talking about.

23:19.340 --> 23:21.854
ln the toilets.

23:21.940 --> 23:24.613
Your son's girlfriend, Frank.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.850
Your girlfriend's daughter.

23:26.940 --> 23:30.535
You're one twisted little shit,
you know that?

23:31.820 --> 23:34.254
Call time on it or l'll blow the whistle.

23:38.300 --> 23:40.495
- What's that about?
- Kev, another.

23:40.580 --> 23:42.889
(Burping) And a whisky chaser.

23:48.300 --> 23:51.053
l don't know. Two baths in one night.

23:51.140 --> 23:53.813
Schools stink worse than hospitals.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.572
Or pubs.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.976
Tell me again, love.

24:01.060 --> 24:04.132
- What? God. How many more times?
- Please.

24:04.220 --> 24:06.654
If I could have gone myself...

24:06.740 --> 24:12.053
All right. He said she was developing
into a very poised young woman.

24:13.140 --> 24:14.812
''Very poised.''

24:15.900 --> 24:18.573
Quite the young lady.

24:18.660 --> 24:20.651
Yeah, she's a woman all right.

24:20.740 --> 24:23.254
The way they grow up these days.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.770
She'll always be a baby to me.

24:31.580 --> 24:33.696
My shopping didn't go very well.

24:34.780 --> 24:36.736
What? Forgot the milk?

24:39.140 --> 24:43.179
If I can't even get out the doors
of a pretend supermarket...

24:43.260 --> 24:45.535
how am I ever gonna get to Malin Head?

24:45.620 --> 24:47.815
Hey, come on, come on.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.730
We are going to Malin Head.

24:50.820 --> 24:53.334
Eh? End of story.

24:57.220 --> 25:01.099
Life's going on all around me, Frank,
and I'm missing out.

25:01.180 --> 25:03.569
Come on, Fi. Shh-shh.

25:03.660 --> 25:07.335
You'll get through those doors
any day now.

25:10.380 --> 25:12.336
And you'll never look back.

25:18.420 --> 25:22.538
If I could get tickets for Heaton Park,
Karen would be well impressed.

25:24.380 --> 25:27.133
Any chance you could lend us
80 of your pink pounds?

25:27.220 --> 25:28.938
(Screaming)

25:31.620 --> 25:34.930
- For God's sake, Debs, give it a rest.
- It's massive!

25:35.020 --> 25:39.138
- Like I can magic 80...quid.
- You could always liberate it from...

25:39.220 --> 25:42.530
- Till he scored...
- Good shot, man.

25:44.140 --> 25:45.175
Job done, Debs.

25:45.260 --> 25:47.455
Right, Debs, your starter for 10.

25:47.540 --> 25:51.089
''Which member of Atomic Kitten
is sporting a face full of moth?''

25:51.180 --> 25:52.852
Not Liz.

25:52.940 --> 25:54.339
Ah, Jenny.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.570
Hey-hey!

25:56.660 --> 25:59.094
l've got 80 quid.

26:01.100 --> 26:02.738
Listen, l'll pay you back.

26:02.820 --> 26:06.608
- I'm not bothered.
- l'm going to take Karen to a festival.

26:06.700 --> 26:10.170
- l'll be well in t'good books.
- Do you need extra, for snacks etc?

26:10.260 --> 26:12.615
No, l've got enough for that.

26:18.500 --> 26:22.209
Look, Debs. I do think
you're a bit weird sometimes,

26:22.300 --> 26:24.495
but...good weird.

26:24.580 --> 26:27.140
- All right?
- Whatever.

26:31.940 --> 26:34.056
Has she taken her sleeping pill?

26:34.140 --> 26:36.859
- No.
- Who's a bold boy?

26:36.940 --> 26:39.613
Listen,
there's no easy way to say this.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.372
It's my lad.

26:41.460 --> 26:45.009
- What about him?
- Look, something's gotta give here

26:45.100 --> 26:49.457
and, as usual, it's yours friggin' truly.
l can't do it to the lad.

26:49.540 --> 26:52.259
l mean, me and you. Massive.

26:52.340 --> 26:54.535
Are you dumping me?

26:54.620 --> 26:56.292
No way!

26:56.380 --> 26:58.894
Hey, driving lessons - I'm there.

26:59.740 --> 27:04.768
Help with your studies. Fix your hi-fi.
I'm there. Just no more...the other.

27:04.860 --> 27:07.249
You can't do this.

27:08.340 --> 27:11.650
A man has gotta look his son in the eye,

27:11.740 --> 27:13.412
hasn't he?

27:13.500 --> 27:16.856
I mean, I held him
the day after he was born.

27:18.860 --> 27:20.816
A dad. I held him.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.891
And everythin'.

27:25.220 --> 27:27.176
You're massive.

27:29.260 --> 27:31.091
Aye.

27:44.220 --> 27:46.654
- See you later. Good night.
- Night.

27:46.740 --> 27:50.176
- Can't half rabbit, my mam.
- Still, you fixed her shower.

27:50.260 --> 27:52.649
And your halo's never been brighter.

27:52.740 --> 27:54.776
You've got to see this.

27:57.780 --> 28:00.089
- Let's just go, eh?
- Wait a minute.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.136
It's a killer.

28:02.220 --> 28:04.415
- It's a Houdini jobby.
- Yeah?

28:04.500 --> 28:06.172
Right.

28:06.260 --> 28:08.216
There's lan, see?

28:08.300 --> 28:10.530
Disappears by the veg.

28:11.580 --> 28:13.855
And there's my husband.

28:13.940 --> 28:18.730
And what do you know? Disappears
into the same Bermuda Triangle.

28:18.820 --> 28:21.254
- Yvonne...
- Oh!

28:21.340 --> 28:23.376
But the grand finale.

28:25.020 --> 28:27.011
Here we go.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.056
Wait for it.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.449
Four and a half minutes later

28:31.540 --> 28:33.258
there's lan

28:33.340 --> 28:36.298
and there's the father of my children

28:36.380 --> 28:39.133
with his shirt...

28:39.220 --> 28:41.450
hanging out the back of his trousers.

28:41.540 --> 28:44.452
- Jesus.
- The original lifted shirt.

28:44.540 --> 28:46.451
- Yvonne...
- Keys.

28:49.940 --> 28:51.851
And the car keys.

28:55.380 --> 28:58.531
(Rock music on inside)

28:58.620 --> 29:00.611
(Music continuing)

29:03.820 --> 29:05.776
Karen? Karen?

29:05.860 --> 29:08.294
l'll leave your cuppa by the door, OK?

29:18.260 --> 29:21.252
Do you think she's angry with me?
Projecting?

29:21.340 --> 29:24.810
- I read it in my Dear Julie column.
- (Frank) Dear Julie?

29:24.900 --> 29:27.130
She knows the square root of fuck all.

29:28.220 --> 29:31.371
Maybe I clip her wings
in ways I didn't even realise.

29:31.460 --> 29:34.133
Would you like me
to have a word with her?

29:34.220 --> 29:37.451
- Oh, that'd be wonderful.
- Oh, the kid'll love that (!)

29:37.540 --> 29:40.816
There she is, having a lie-in -
happy as Larry.

29:40.900 --> 29:45.496
Next thing she knows, Nurse Looney
Tunes is sat at the end of her bed!

29:46.580 --> 29:48.650
No offence, like.

29:48.740 --> 29:50.412
(Footsteps on stairs)

29:52.260 --> 29:53.818
(Door slams)

29:56.420 --> 29:59.856
It's not hereditary, Frank.
I'm not catching.

30:02.180 --> 30:05.138
(Mimicking trombone)

30:10.260 --> 30:14.048
- Francisco?
- No chit-chat. Give us a large whisky.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.972
- What have you said to the kids?
- Oh, you know.

30:21.060 --> 30:24.735
''Daddy's going to hell in a handcart.
Daddy likes hot cock!''

30:25.820 --> 30:29.130
- Like I'm gonna tell the kids.
- And what about me mam?

30:30.220 --> 30:33.018
Oh, you bastard.

30:34.060 --> 30:35.778
Well, what about me?

30:36.860 --> 30:39.328
I'm sorry.

30:39.420 --> 30:43.129
New house rules.
We shag until I get pregnant.

30:43.220 --> 30:45.688
- What?
- I want another baby.

30:45.780 --> 30:47.452
Yvonne!

30:47.540 --> 30:51.692
From now on, you kip up there. You can
only come home to visit the kids,

30:51.780 --> 30:55.216
and once I'm pregnant,
shag who you like - front or back -

30:55.300 --> 30:59.009
but not here
and only after I'm up the duff.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.534
And what about him?

31:15.180 --> 31:17.978
- There's summat you should know.
- Me first.

31:22.900 --> 31:24.652
Da-da!

31:24.740 --> 31:26.810
Oh, my God.

31:26.900 --> 31:30.176
Heaton Park... Well, these cost a fortune.

31:30.260 --> 31:33.172
l had to flog one of my kidneys.
l'll be fine.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.216
You're mad.

31:37.300 --> 31:39.416
l love you, you clown.

32:00.940 --> 32:04.649
- Do you want to watch a vid?
- No, look.

32:04.740 --> 32:06.776
There's no easy way to say this.

32:07.820 --> 32:11.210
- We should stop seeing each other.
- What? Cos the sex is crap?

32:11.300 --> 32:14.212
l just think it'd be better
if we were mates.

32:14.300 --> 32:18.691
- If it's because I said "I love you"...
- It's not that.

32:19.780 --> 32:21.611
What was all that about?

32:21.700 --> 32:24.089
Payback for the fucking tickets?

32:24.180 --> 32:26.136
An 80 quid special?

32:28.340 --> 32:31.616
Great. Look...

32:32.700 --> 32:35.851
You don't have to dump me.
l don't love you, honest.

32:35.940 --> 32:38.295
- I'm sorry.
- Please don't do this.

32:38.380 --> 32:40.336
Look, I don't love ya.

32:40.420 --> 32:42.854
ls there somebody else?

32:48.260 --> 32:51.411
- What are you doing up here?
- I'm gone.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.651
Lip?

33:00.780 --> 33:02.975
Look, please don't say owt.

33:06.300 --> 33:08.256
Oh, Lip...

33:10.420 --> 33:12.376
Come on, sweetheart.

33:12.460 --> 33:14.291
Let's leave him alone.

33:28.860 --> 33:31.055
Who do you reckon it is, then, Lip?

33:32.300 --> 33:34.256
l'll twat him for you.

33:34.340 --> 33:36.296
She took both tickets.

33:36.380 --> 33:38.336
Nice.

33:39.740 --> 33:42.334
Blew you off then blew you out.

33:44.580 --> 33:46.536
You're about this funny.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.690
So why you laughing?

33:50.780 --> 33:54.170
Cos I'm 80 quid down
and my girlfriend's dumped me!

34:12.420 --> 34:15.014
- Heaton Park. Any takers?
- No chance.

34:15.100 --> 34:18.649
- She'd never know.
- I thought Lip was going with you.

34:18.739 --> 34:20.696
Lip's history.

34:20.780 --> 34:22.735
Go on, you.

34:22.820 --> 34:24.811
Me.

34:24.900 --> 34:27.494
Away from this place.

34:27.580 --> 34:29.536
K, you and me are finito, kid.

34:30.620 --> 34:32.576
Aye. Comprende?

34:32.659 --> 34:35.618
Well and truly finito.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.456
Get yourself an E or somethin'.

35:10.220 --> 35:12.176

35:19.220 --> 35:21.450
State of you!

35:21.540 --> 35:23.496
You're too kind.

35:24.580 --> 35:27.048
- Come on.
- Whorrr!

35:32.580 --> 35:36.334
Am I allowed to say
you're worth ten of her?

35:37.420 --> 35:40.218
Oh, the top's open. There's a surprise.

35:40.300 --> 35:42.814
l don't know what's got into Dad lately.

35:42.900 --> 35:45.095
Driving lessons for Karen.

35:45.180 --> 35:47.535
- Parents' evening.
- Yeah.

35:47.620 --> 35:50.339
More of a dad to her
than he's ever been to us.

35:50.420 --> 35:52.980
What's got into your daddy lately, eh?

36:04.700 --> 36:07.692
- How's your love life, lan?
- What love life?

36:07.780 --> 36:11.250
- No girlfriend keeping you up all night?
- ln my dreams.

36:11.340 --> 36:13.376
(Mouths)

36:14.700 --> 36:17.260
(Mouths)

36:17.340 --> 36:20.457
(Yvonne) She knows.

36:22.500 --> 36:25.094
He's trying to tell you that I know.

36:27.780 --> 36:32.058
The bad news is you've had your hands
in my husband's boxers.

36:32.140 --> 36:34.608
But it could have been worse.

36:34.700 --> 36:37.498
You could have had 'em in the till.

36:37.580 --> 36:40.856
- I'm not sacked?
- Take over here.

36:40.940 --> 36:44.330
Gaylord'll fill you in
on the terms and conditions.

36:49.620 --> 36:51.576
- Oh, and lan.
- Yeah?

36:51.660 --> 36:54.220
Lose the black hole of Calcutta.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.972
lan, come here.

36:58.660 --> 37:00.378
Don't ever...

37:00.460 --> 37:02.496
touch him again.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.496
My dad, isn't it?

37:33.380 --> 37:35.336
(Sobbing)

37:59.060 --> 38:00.732
Hey!

38:03.860 --> 38:05.976
For Christ's sake.

38:07.060 --> 38:09.016
You fucked her!

38:13.020 --> 38:14.976
Sounds like Frank.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.016
It's Lip!

38:17.100 --> 38:18.897
Oh, my God!

38:18.980 --> 38:21.494
You fucked her!

38:26.380 --> 38:28.655
- Help!
- Dial 999, Karen!

38:28.740 --> 38:30.696
I'm coming, Frank!

38:30.780 --> 38:32.338
Help!

38:38.100 --> 38:40.170
I'm coming, Frank!

38:51.620 --> 38:53.576
Get off me. Let me kill him!

38:53.660 --> 38:55.537
He fucked her. Get off me.

38:55.620 --> 39:00.774
I'm gonna kill him! Get off me.
He fucked her and I'm gonna fucking...

39:01.860 --> 39:04.249
Now, come on. Ease off. Stop it.

39:04.340 --> 39:06.535
You animal!

39:06.620 --> 39:08.417
Ow!

39:08.500 --> 39:11.572
(Frank) Look, Sheila...
(Lip) He fucked her.

39:12.460 --> 39:15.213
- Get yourself up, mate. Come on.
- Get off me.

39:15.300 --> 39:18.212
- Come on, get yourself up.
- Just get off me.

39:18.300 --> 39:21.053
- Get off me!
- Calm down, mate. All right?

39:24.140 --> 39:26.096
Oh, oh-oh, oh.

39:26.180 --> 39:28.136
Baby.

39:29.220 --> 39:31.973
Why, Frank?
Why would he do this to you?

39:33.060 --> 39:35.494
Because he's a bloody psycho.

39:36.580 --> 39:38.536
l told him straight -

39:38.620 --> 39:40.576
nice and reasonable,

39:41.660 --> 39:45.255
''You'll get your 20 quid
when me Giro comes.''

39:46.340 --> 39:49.889
Next thing I know,
he's beating me to death.

39:49.980 --> 39:52.050
What? All this over money?

39:52.140 --> 39:54.096
Yeah, bloody pin money.

39:56.180 --> 39:59.889
l wish you'd have asked me for it.
l'd give you anything.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.016
No, I don't want to take advantage...

40:02.100 --> 40:03.897
(Sheila) You're too soft, Frank.

40:03.980 --> 40:05.777
Ahh.

40:06.860 --> 40:09.328
Oh, Frank.

40:09.420 --> 40:11.376
Oh, baby.

40:28.660 --> 40:30.616
When did you find out?

40:32.180 --> 40:34.136
A few days ago.

40:35.220 --> 40:37.176
Exactly?

40:39.460 --> 40:40.939
Two.

40:42.100 --> 40:44.056
I'm sorry, Lip.

40:50.700 --> 40:52.770
Suppose I could do a ciggie.

41:12.740 --> 41:14.696
Some toast.

41:14.780 --> 41:17.931
- Do you want me...
- Peanut butter. Two slices.

41:18.020 --> 41:21.808
- Cut up in little triangles or something?
- Surprise me.

41:26.860 --> 41:29.374
- Think l'll have it in my room.
- Yeah?

41:53.460 --> 41:55.416
- (Tapping at window)
- (Frank) Lip?

41:59.660 --> 42:01.616
Open the window, Son.

42:11.540 --> 42:14.008
(Frank) I'm sorry, OK? I'm a twat.

42:14.100 --> 42:16.660
No, I am. Prize prick.

42:16.740 --> 42:20.130
If your grandad were here,
he'd be saying the same.

42:22.900 --> 42:24.856
It's totally...

42:24.940 --> 42:27.613
down to me. I know.
You know, we all do...

42:27.700 --> 42:30.772
Well, not totally, is it? She's completely...

42:31.860 --> 42:35.455
Well, it's like the moon
orbiting round the Earth.

42:35.540 --> 42:40.056
These things sometimes fly off
in your face, don't they?

42:40.140 --> 42:45.134
We can't hold that against her, Son,
can we? She's young, she's footloose.

42:45.220 --> 42:48.257
We're both victims in this -
you know, you and me.

42:48.340 --> 42:50.979
Both bloody victims, like...

42:53.700 --> 42:56.612
How can I ever say I'm sorry?

42:58.620 --> 43:00.895
Fuck's sake!

43:04.140 --> 43:06.734
Oh, OK. All right. Fair enough. ls it...

43:26.980 --> 43:31.656
(Lip) 'She moved into her grandma's
that night. l've seen her twice at school.

43:31.740 --> 43:35.779
'She didn't see me.
Honouring thy father - takes some doing.

43:35.860 --> 43:37.816
'They say give to receive,

43:37.900 --> 43:42.894
'which is impossible with somebody
who believes in share and share alike.'

43:42.980 --> 43:44.652
(Man) How do, Frank?

43:44.740 --> 43:47.254
- Yeah, not bad. OK. Good night.
- Good night.

44:09.900 --> 44:12.494
Who are you?
Who said you could come in?

44:12.580 --> 44:14.616
Two grand of debt, and mounting!

44:14.700 --> 44:17.533
Pay up or he does without.
We're talking legs.

44:17.620 --> 44:21.613
Where is he? Know what your new name
is, Frank? Dead Man Walking.

44:21.700 --> 44:24.658
l reckon he's used his full name
somewhere.

44:24.740 --> 44:28.779
Request from the Child Support Agency
for a domestic circumstances appraisal.

44:28.860 --> 44:30.976
What's this got to do with them?

44:31.060 --> 44:33.176
Your mum must have asked
for a summary.

44:33.260 --> 44:35.057
You know where she is?

44:35.140 --> 44:36.778
- You know where Mum is!
- No.

44:36.860 --> 44:39.613
- Liar.
- Think I'm going round chasing skirt?

44:39.700 --> 44:42.498
A bloke couldn't love anybody
more than I love you.

44:43.580 --> 44:45.571
Mum...

45:22.660 --> 45:25.538
Past the fruit and veg.

45:25.620 --> 45:28.771
- It's too near the doors.
- You're doing great.

45:28.860 --> 45:30.816
(Sheila) Hang on.

45:32.180 --> 45:37.095
They're charging 3.80 for panty liners.
How's that worth coming out for?
