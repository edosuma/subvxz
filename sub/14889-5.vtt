This is very exciting.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.422
An article
by Larry Appleton

01:29.455 --> 01:31.224
on the front page
of the Chronicle.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.393
Well, actually,
it’s by Marshall and Walpole

01:33.426 --> 01:34.861
but they’ll mention
that I worked on it.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.497
After all, without my research
there’d be no article.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.565
Well, here it is.

"Money Laundering In Chicago,
A Dirty Business."

01:44.370 --> 01:46.272
Nifty title, Larry.

01:46.306 --> 01:48.474
Well, actually, Marshall
thought of the title...

01:48.509 --> 01:50.376
...but I put in
the punctuation.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.681
Cousin, question,
when they launder money...

01:54.715 --> 01:57.851
...do they have to wash the tens
and the twenties separately?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.823
No, Balki, money laundering
is taking money

02:02.856 --> 02:04.891
that’s been made illegally
and funneling it

02:04.925 --> 02:07.493
through a legitimate business

02:07.528 --> 02:08.662

02:11.765 --> 02:14.501
So is, is static cling
a problem?

02:20.741 --> 02:22.743
Not if they use
a fabric softener.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.680
Larry, I don’t see
your name here.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.515
Well, it wouldn’t be
on the front page.

believe that?

04:07.413 --> 04:09.349
No, I can’t.

04:09.382 --> 04:13.353
That second‐hand smoke
can be pretty nauseating.

to talk to somebody.

get your eyes examined

every fact myself.

triple‐checked them

was filled with half‐truths

kind of acknowledgment

just being modest.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.737

08:23.770 --> 08:25.672
if it hadn’t
have been for Cousin Larry

08:25.706 --> 08:27.808
that article would never
have been printed.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.712

08:35.115 --> 08:36.549
That’s not too tight,
is it?

08:36.582 --> 08:38.619
No, it‐it’s quite comfortable.
Thank you.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.556
But you know, next time
you might want to think about

08:42.589 --> 08:44.157
using a sheep shank knot.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.194
It allows some freedom
of movement

08:48.228 --> 08:50.163
with a minimum of chafing.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.834
I can do a sheep shank.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.702

08:55.736 --> 08:57.003
Get out of the city!

a sheep shank knot?

08:59.706 --> 09:01.007
‐Balki!
‐Right over, yeah. Huh?

09:01.041 --> 09:04.611
He’s not going
for a merit badge.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.080
He’s threatening
to blow us up.

09:07.113 --> 09:10.116
Well, how would he
do that?

09:10.150 --> 09:13.286
He has 20 sticks
of dynamite strapped‐‐

09:13.319 --> 09:16.122
‐Twenty four.
‐24 sticks of dynamite.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.291
Strapped to his chest!

09:22.295 --> 09:24.865
They’re not
purely decorative?

09:28.835 --> 09:31.905
No, they’re not
purely decorative.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.677
Well, then...

09:36.710 --> 09:40.346
...uh, that would
constitute a‐a bomb.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.284
Yes, yes, it would.

09:47.353 --> 09:49.289
This man could blow us up.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.159
We should never
have let him

09:53.193 --> 09:55.128
tie us to this chair.

Why are you doing this?

‐Who am I?
‐And why are you doing this?

10:07.273 --> 10:08.975
And why am I
doing this?

you are.

who Marvin Berman is?

But then...

10:16.883 --> 10:18.785
...that’s the story
of my life.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.253
I do all the work
and someone else

10:20.286 --> 10:22.322
takes all the credit.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.725
Well, I need to be given
some credit, too.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.993
I need to be recognized.
I need to be acknowledged!

10:27.027 --> 10:28.995
I need my own place
in the sun!

10:29.029 --> 10:31.732

a Club Med vacation.

and Indians" on your own time.

even work here. Take a hike.

antagonize him.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.194
A‐a bomb.

11:01.227 --> 11:04.030

Yeah. Right.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.732
A bomb.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.169

A bomb.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.838
Oh, my God.
He’s got a bomb.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.309
Please, please,
you’ve got to let me go.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.145
I’ve got four kids
and a pregnant wife at home.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.783
Mr. Gorpley!

11:22.816 --> 11:25.852
This must have been
some whirlpool romance!

11:28.154 --> 11:30.223
Just this morning
you were single.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.795
Shouldn’t you
tape his mouth?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.162
Okay, okay.
How about this?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.064
Please, please!
I’m begging you! I’m young.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.399
I’ve got my whole life
ahead of me.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.201
It’s okay. It’s okay.
Look. Look. Look.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.169
‐I’ve already got hostages.
‐Oh.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.337
But you...

11:44.370 --> 11:46.006
...you can
tell the police

11:46.039 --> 11:47.207
and the news media.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.875
Oh, I can do that.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.211
Tell them that I’m holding
your two friends prisoner

11:51.244 --> 11:52.813
and if I don’t get
what I want

11:52.846 --> 11:54.948
I’m blowing this building
to kingdom come.

11:54.981 --> 11:56.917
[dramatic music]

11:58.251 --> 12:00.220
[police siren wailing]

12:03.256 --> 12:05.491
Alright, listen, lieutenant,
the next time this phone rings

12:05.526 --> 12:06.392
it better be
the publisher.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.128
Now, you’ve got
exactly ten minutes

12:08.161 --> 12:09.229
or I am blowing
this building up

12:09.262 --> 12:11.732
and I am setting
the timer...now.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.802
Oh, hey, uh, Marvin, Marvin,
uh, question here.

12:15.836 --> 12:16.903
What is it?

12:16.937 --> 12:18.238
What‐uh‐uh‐just out of, uh

12:18.271 --> 12:20.206
just out of idle curiosity, uh

12:20.240 --> 12:23.510
w‐w‐w‐what is it
that you want?

12:23.544 --> 12:25.178
What is it I want?

12:25.211 --> 12:27.514
[sighs]
Well, alright,
I’ll tell you exactly

12:27.548 --> 12:28.882
what it is
that I want.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.350
Excuse me,
excuse me, Marvin.

12:30.383 --> 12:33.453
Um, before you get
bogged down in the details

12:33.486 --> 12:35.188
aren’t you forgetting
something?

12:35.221 --> 12:36.089
No, I don’t think so.

12:36.122 --> 12:39.760
Yes. You were about
to set your timer.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.265
[sighs]

12:45.298 --> 12:47.868
Thanks. Where is my head?

12:50.303 --> 12:52.539
[beeping]

12:54.575 --> 12:57.177
Why did you tell him
to set the timer?

12:57.210 --> 13:00.313
Because if he doesn’t
set the timer...

13:00.346 --> 13:02.215
[gasping]

13:08.088 --> 13:09.923
Bad move, huh?

13:12.425 --> 13:15.128
Marvin, why are
you doing this

13:15.161 --> 13:17.297
over a‐a silly article?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.431
Because it gave
all the credit

13:18.464 --> 13:20.433
to that idiot boss
of mine.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.835
When the real mastermind

13:21.868 --> 13:23.937
behind the money
laundering scheme...

13:23.970 --> 13:25.238
...was me.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.440
‐You?
‐Yes.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.442
I set up
the dummy corporations.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.277
I set up
the fake bank accounts.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.346
I picked out
the office furniture.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.183
Why haven’t I
ever heard of you?

13:37.217 --> 13:38.418
I’ve been roommates
for three years.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.187
Not you!
Not you!

13:41.221 --> 13:45.491
Him! Why haven’t I
ever heard of him?

13:46.492 --> 13:48.461
Well, how
should I know?

13:48.494 --> 13:50.196
Marvin, could you
enlighten us?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.199
Because I’m just
the accountant.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.268
And no one pays attention
to the accountant

13:55.301 --> 13:57.103
but they will now.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.204
When I talk
to the publisher

13:58.238 --> 13:59.305
I’m gonna
demand recognition.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.075
I’m gonna make the Chronicle
print a retraction.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.877
A retraction!
A retraction!

14:03.910 --> 14:05.612
G‐good idea.
Now that’s constructive!

14:05.646 --> 14:07.113
But what kind of retraction?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.982
A complete retraction?
A partial retraction?

14:09.015 --> 14:10.450
Marvin! Marvin! Marvin!

14:12.252 --> 14:14.320
You should know
exactly what you want

14:14.354 --> 14:16.122
before the publisher
calls because

14:16.156 --> 14:18.191
[chuckling]
you know, we don’t
have a lot of...

14:18.224 --> 14:19.893
...time here.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.064
You know,
you’re absolutely right!

14:24.097 --> 14:26.032
I didn’t think
this far ahead.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.168
Well, I’ve been kind of busy.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.469
I had to go
all the way to Skokie

14:29.503 --> 14:31.337
to get the timer.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.573
Well, Marvin,
you should have gone

14:32.606 --> 14:34.608
to Sal’s Hardware
on Lincoln Avenue.

14:36.442 --> 14:37.477
They got everything.

14:37.511 --> 14:38.512
You know what they say

14:38.545 --> 14:41.081
"If Sal don’t have it,
you don’t need it."

14:43.116 --> 14:44.618
M‐Marvin, listen.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.220
You should write down
your demands.

14:47.253 --> 14:48.922
Why don’t you just take
a few moments

14:48.955 --> 14:51.057
you know, private moments
for yourself

14:51.091 --> 14:54.227
away from all this hustle
and this bustle.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.262
You‐you know, there’s
a private office back there.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.232
That’s a good idea.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.034
Alright, um,
I’ll be right back.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.206
Come on, Balki.
Let’s get out of here.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.908
Head for the loading dock.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.980
Hey, guys...

15:18.184 --> 15:20.220
Can I run this
by you?

15:20.253 --> 15:22.055
What do you think
I should call myself?

15:22.088 --> 15:24.525
Criminal mastermind
or diabolical genius?

15:25.759 --> 15:28.028
Diabolical genius.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.095
I don’t know.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.197
It‐it’s a little
too Batman.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.666
Hmm.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.500
Marvin, l‐listen.

15:34.535 --> 15:37.037
You know, I‐I think
this whole bomb thing

15:37.070 --> 15:38.705
is the wrong way to go.

15:38.739 --> 15:40.373
I mean, even if they
print a retraction

15:40.406 --> 15:42.576
I don’t see how
you can avoid going to jail.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.045
Well, he could turn
state’s evidence.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.347
‐State’s evidence?
‐Yes!

15:47.380 --> 15:49.616
That way you could tell
your side of the story

15:49.650 --> 15:52.318
get the recognition
you so richly deserve

15:52.352 --> 15:55.121
participate in the federal
witness protection program

15:55.155 --> 15:58.024
and avoid
a lengthy prison term.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.526
Balki, where did you learn
about state’s evidence?

15:59.560 --> 16:01.562
On the all new "Columbo".

16:04.330 --> 16:06.032
Marvin...

16:06.066 --> 16:07.133
Balki’s right.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.234
If you turn yourself in

16:08.268 --> 16:09.503
testify against
your boss

16:09.536 --> 16:12.405
you’ll not only get the credit
but you’ll also be a hero.

16:13.674 --> 16:15.441
‐Me?
‐’Yes.’

16:15.475 --> 16:18.111
‐A hero?
‐Absolutely.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.080
And you know
what happens to heroes.

16:23.517 --> 16:24.751
People magazine?

16:26.186 --> 16:29.155
And talk shows.
Maybe even a book.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.357
I’d help you write it!

16:31.391 --> 16:32.325
The sooner you untie us

16:32.358 --> 16:34.695
the sooner I can get
the wheels in motion.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.129
I’ll do it!

16:37.764 --> 16:40.767
Oh, and, uh, you know,
uh, Marvin

16:40.801 --> 16:42.536
uh, you also might want to

16:42.569 --> 16:44.437
turn off your bomb.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.406
Oh! Of course.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.109
You know, I never really meant
it to go this far anyway.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.514
[timer beeping]

16:53.547 --> 16:55.248
I hate these
digital clocks.

16:56.517 --> 16:57.751
[timer beeping]

16:57.784 --> 17:00.220
Guys...guys,
it won’t turn off.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.589
Oh.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.060
Well, you should have
gone to Sal’s.

17:07.093 --> 17:09.029
I’m not going
to say it again.

17:11.097 --> 17:13.098
Marvin! Do something!

17:13.133 --> 17:14.500
Don’t rush me!

17:14.535 --> 17:16.102
I’m not good
under pressure.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.238
Alright, now listen,
I just have to disconnect it.

17:18.271 --> 17:22.175
So I just pull the red wire.
Or is it the white one?

17:25.546 --> 17:26.512
I don’t know!

17:26.547 --> 17:30.517
Oh, oh, guys, guys,
I’m no good in the field.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.118
I’m just an idea man.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.620
Whoa!

17:33.654 --> 17:35.288
Oh, I‐I feel
kind of sick.

17:35.321 --> 17:36.757
I‐I think
I’d better sit down.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.324
I feel like
I’m gonna faint.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.526
‐No! No! No! No!
‐I am! I am!

17:39.560 --> 17:41.762
Marvin, Marvin!
You can’t faint now!

17:41.795 --> 17:44.464
Marvin? Marvin?
You alright, alright? Okay?

17:44.497 --> 17:45.666
Okay. Okay.

17:45.699 --> 17:47.400
Whoa, I’m okay.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.835
Oh.

17:50.671 --> 17:52.205
Oh, my God!

17:52.238 --> 17:53.306
He’s out cold.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.175
Balki, we’ve only
got a minute!

17:55.208 --> 17:56.743
Let’s get out of here!

17:59.546 --> 18:00.781
Balki!

18:00.814 --> 18:03.116
Cousin, I can’t leave him
like this.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.485
I’ve got to try to turn off
the bomb. Go ahead without me.

18:05.519 --> 18:08.755
[sighs]
I hate when you do this.

18:08.789 --> 18:09.690
Alright, alright,
let me try.

18:09.723 --> 18:10.924
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

18:10.957 --> 18:13.226
‐Cousin, Cousin, I think‐‐
‐Alright, red wire, white wire.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.628
Red wire, white wire,
uh, red light at night

18:14.661 --> 18:15.729
sailor’s delight.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.331
[mumbling]
Who cares about sailors?

18:18.364 --> 18:19.332
A green wire!

18:19.365 --> 18:21.668
He didn’t say anything
about a green wire!

18:21.702 --> 18:23.537
Marvin! Marvin!

18:23.570 --> 18:26.406
What about
the green wire, Marvin?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.542
Tell us about the green wire?

18:28.575 --> 18:30.544
Cousin.
Cousin! Cousin!

18:33.647 --> 18:35.415
I’m going to try
the red one.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.718
No, Balki, don’t.
What if we make a mistake?

18:37.751 --> 18:39.886
Well, Cousin, we’ve got
five seconds left!

18:39.920 --> 18:42.155
What’s the worst
that could happen?

18:42.188 --> 18:43.824
[beeping]

18:43.857 --> 18:45.859
Do it!

[dramatic music]

18:47.761 --> 18:49.462
Balki, you did it!

You did it!
We’re alive! We’re alive!

better get going.

at work by 7:00.

be at work until 10:00.

of the flight crew

19:57.297 --> 19:58.865
has to get in early.

Oh, throw it in my face,
why don’t you?

20:02.603 --> 20:04.437
What is your problem,
you acted the same way

20:04.470 --> 20:06.339
when I was elected
class treasurer?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.908
You were elected
class treasurer?

Another thing
you never told me!

20:11.612 --> 20:14.314
Mary Anne, you were
my campaign manager.

20:16.016 --> 20:17.751
Oh, right!

20:20.787 --> 20:22.623
Cousin, look at this.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.991
Here’s another article
about Marvin.

20:25.025 --> 20:26.993
Really?

20:27.027 --> 20:29.796
"Marvin Berman, self‐confessed
criminal mastermind‐‐"

on a roll or what?

20:47.313 --> 20:51.384

That book was my idea.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.519
When am I gonna get
a break?

20:52.553 --> 20:56.456
Cousin, wait a minute.
Are you listening to yourself?

20:57.724 --> 21:00.026
Well, Balki, all I want
is the credit I deserve.

21:00.060 --> 21:02.062
Well, so did
Marvin Berman.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.798
And look what
happened to him.

21:04.831 --> 21:08.468
Cousin, yesterday
all you wanted

21:08.502 --> 21:10.871
was your name
in little tiny letters

21:10.904 --> 21:13.774
at the end of a very
long article.

21:13.807 --> 21:18.879
And today you got your name
in big black letters...

21:18.912 --> 21:20.380
...on the front page

21:20.413 --> 21:23.617
and you’re
still not happy.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.952
If you ask me
you can’t see

21:25.986 --> 21:28.288
DeForest Kelley
for the trees.

21:33.527 --> 21:35.395
I guess things are going
pretty well, aren’t they?

21:35.428 --> 21:37.898
Well, isn’t that
the undergarment of the year?

21:43.069 --> 21:45.539
Balki, don’t you wanna
read my article?

21:45.572 --> 21:47.340
Why cousin?
You already read it to us.

21:47.373 --> 21:49.543
And very well,
I might add.

21:49.576 --> 21:52.579
Well, you might at least, uh,
take a look at the very end.

21:58.084 --> 22:01.622
"Balki Bartokomous contributed
to this article."

22:07.661 --> 22:10.597
My name
in the paper.

22:10.631 --> 22:12.566
Wait until
mama sees this.

22:15.936 --> 22:17.604
Thank you, cousin.

22:17.638 --> 22:19.072
You’re welcome.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.908
Listen, cousin,
maybe someday

22:21.942 --> 22:24.811
the team of Bartokomous
and Appleton

22:24.845 --> 22:26.613
will win
a Pulitzer prize.

22:31.985 --> 22:33.554
Appleton
and Bartokomous.

22:33.587 --> 22:35.088
Y‐you’re absolutely
right. Yeah.
