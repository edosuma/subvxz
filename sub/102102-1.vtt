00:00.691 --> 00:04.358
(fire roaring sound effect)

00:18.301 --> 00:20.718
(soft music)

01:55.670 --> 01:56.980
- Hey, look, here's a new guy.

01:56.980 --> 01:58.810
- I seen that. I ain't
never seen him before.

01:58.810 --> 02:00.930
- You take his shoes, I'll take his money.

02:00.930 --> 02:01.780
- I'm on it, man.

02:08.868 --> 02:13.035
(dramatic heartbeat sound effect)

02:16.907 --> 02:20.657
(dramatic thud sound effect)

02:23.681 --> 02:25.110
(man panting)

02:25.110 --> 02:28.230
Whoa man. I thought you was already dead.

02:28.230 --> 02:29.445
- Get outta here! Go!

02:29.445 --> 02:30.856
- It's all good. It's all good.

02:30.856 --> 02:32.773
- [Man] Get outta here.

02:34.877 --> 02:37.390
(man grunting)

02:37.390 --> 02:39.417
- Hey, hey mister.

02:39.417 --> 02:40.250
You okay?

02:41.267 --> 02:43.670
You don't look so good.

02:43.670 --> 02:44.920
I brought you some water.

02:47.810 --> 02:51.718
Here, I'll hold it. I'll
hold it. (woman whimpering)

02:52.700 --> 02:54.093
You was thirsty.

02:56.748 --> 02:58.920
(man grunts)

02:58.920 --> 02:59.870
- [Man] Where am I?

03:01.460 --> 03:03.700
- You're under the Second Street bridge.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.470
You don't remember how you got here?

03:05.470 --> 03:07.110
People like, dressed like you

03:07.110 --> 03:09.050
don't come and hang out down here.

03:09.050 --> 03:12.041
Here, let me help you.
Girlfriend, get over here.

03:12.041 --> 03:13.291
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

03:16.188 --> 03:18.593
Come on we help you.

03:18.593 --> 03:22.113
You okay? You can walk by yourself?

03:22.113 --> 03:24.065
(man panting)

03:24.065 --> 03:24.898
(man grunts)

03:24.898 --> 03:27.200
Hey cat, what's your name?

03:29.684 --> 03:31.431
- I don't know.

03:31.431 --> 03:34.514
(anticipatory music)

03:38.560 --> 03:41.040
Help me. Help me. Help me.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.620
- Get away from me you filthy beggar.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.532
Or I'll punch you in the face!

03:44.532 --> 03:47.115
(man grunting)

03:48.791 --> 03:51.054
(man crying)

03:51.054 --> 03:53.554
(man screams)

03:54.515 --> 03:58.098
(dramatic music continues)

04:02.435 --> 04:03.908
(man groans)
(woman screams)

04:03.908 --> 04:08.575
(dramatic anticipatory music continues)

04:20.863 --> 04:21.696
(woman screams)

04:21.696 --> 04:23.953
Can you help me?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:23.953 --> 04:25.114
What's going on here?

04:25.114 --> 04:27.180
Hey!
- Oh my!

04:27.180 --> 04:28.330
- Seems to be the problem.

04:28.330 --> 04:29.163
- This (indistinct)
just tried to attack me.

04:29.163 --> 04:31.325
- No, no, no, no. I was
asking you a question.

04:31.325 --> 04:33.790
- Hey, listen here, you need
to keep your filthy hands

04:33.790 --> 04:34.660
to yourself.

04:34.660 --> 04:35.493
You hear me?

04:35.493 --> 04:36.470
- Yeah. I hear you.

04:36.470 --> 04:39.880
- Yeah, we have ordinances in
this town against panhandling.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.730
- I don't even know what town I'm in.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.490
What town am I in?

04:44.490 --> 04:45.610
What town am I in?

04:45.610 --> 04:47.040
- You trying to be a funny guy?

04:47.040 --> 04:48.130
- I'm not trying to be funny.

04:48.130 --> 04:50.260
I just need to know where I'm at.

04:50.260 --> 04:51.390
- You know what?

04:51.390 --> 04:53.399
Welcome to the city of hard knocks.

04:53.399 --> 04:56.566
(loud thud and crash)

04:57.439 --> 04:59.167
- Thank you, officer.

04:59.167 --> 05:00.834
- My pleasure ma'am.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.940
- Yeah dispatch.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.550
10 50.

05:14.550 --> 05:16.650
Send a wagon over to second and main over.

05:17.870 --> 05:18.703
Roger that.

05:23.636 --> 05:26.719
(anticipatory music)

05:43.016 --> 05:44.209
(kissing sounds)

05:44.209 --> 05:45.400
(man whistles)

05:45.400 --> 05:46.690
- Good morning.

05:46.690 --> 05:48.560
Or should I say good afternoon?

05:48.560 --> 05:49.920
- Where am I at?

05:49.920 --> 05:51.380
- Doesn't matter where you're at.

05:51.380 --> 05:52.480
- Who put me here?

05:52.480 --> 05:53.313
Who's in charge?

05:54.500 --> 05:56.770
- I am. I rule.

05:56.770 --> 05:58.910
As long as you're in here, I rule.

05:58.910 --> 06:00.720
- Back away man. Back away.
- Hey man, no one tells me

06:00.720 --> 06:02.973
to back away, I rule this.

06:02.973 --> 06:03.806
- Guard!

06:03.806 --> 06:05.250
- You need to get back to Mexico.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.300
South to the border, this ain't East L.A.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.543
- Hey, you.
- Guard!

06:09.543 --> 06:11.920
- You. Do you even know
what you're doing in here

06:11.920 --> 06:14.033
and what you did to get in here?

06:15.062 --> 06:16.100
(loud thud)

06:16.100 --> 06:18.200
- Don't you ever put your hands on me.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.112
You know-

06:19.112 --> 06:24.112
(loud thuds)
(man coughing)

06:24.891 --> 06:26.602
- Go back where? Huh?

06:26.602 --> 06:30.585
Go back where? Huh?
- I'm gonna get you.

06:30.585 --> 06:32.035
(man choking)

06:32.035 --> 06:34.618
(upbeat music)

06:50.560 --> 06:53.573
- Hey, man, what happened to you?

06:53.573 --> 06:56.600
- I had an altercation with some inmates.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.820
- I'm sorry what'd you say?

06:57.820 --> 06:59.740
- I got beat up.

06:59.740 --> 07:01.370
- You got beat up, huh?

07:01.370 --> 07:04.690
- Yeah. My jaw is killing me too.

07:04.690 --> 07:05.940
Think it might be broken.

07:07.180 --> 07:08.820
- Well, that's not good,

07:08.820 --> 07:11.010
because we're gonna be talking
to the judge here in a minute

07:11.010 --> 07:13.710
and you're gonna have to
speak up so she can hear you.

07:15.010 --> 07:16.167
- Who are you?

07:16.167 --> 07:17.310
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:17.310 --> 07:18.350
I didn't introduce myself.

07:18.350 --> 07:21.060
I'm your designated public defender.

07:21.060 --> 07:22.200
- Your name?

07:22.200 --> 07:23.960
- That's not important.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.010
You just need some kind
of token representation

07:27.010 --> 07:29.940
because that's how this
whole justice system works.

07:29.940 --> 07:31.540
- Yeah. I don't have one either.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.930
- You don't what?

07:33.930 --> 07:35.430
- A name.

07:35.430 --> 07:36.630
I don't have one either.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.030
- A name?

07:40.030 --> 07:42.296
Yeah, you do. It's right here.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.129
- John.

07:44.022 --> 07:44.855
- [Man] John?

07:44.855 --> 07:46.310
- Yeah John.

07:46.310 --> 07:47.143
John Doe.

07:49.500 --> 07:50.590
- John Doe?

07:50.590 --> 07:52.750
- Well, that's obviously
not your real name.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.700
They probably booked you
under the name John Doe,

07:54.700 --> 07:57.000
because you were unresponsive.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.500
- Unresponsive? I was knocked out.

08:00.500 --> 08:01.670
- Right.

08:01.670 --> 08:03.360
So if I could just get your full name

08:03.360 --> 08:04.610
for the case file please.

08:06.807 --> 08:08.670
- What don't you understand?

08:08.670 --> 08:12.300
I got hit in the head.
I don't know my name.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.230
I don't know nothing.

08:13.230 --> 08:14.710
I don't even know why I'm here.

08:14.710 --> 08:15.940
Why am I here?

08:15.940 --> 08:18.150
- Listen, I don't have
time for games right now.

08:18.150 --> 08:19.920
- I'm not playing games here.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.113
I don't know.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.850
- That's not good,

08:25.850 --> 08:28.480
because the judge is gonna
wanna know who you are.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.630
- Don't you think I
wanna know who I am, huh?

08:31.630 --> 08:33.730
- You'd be surprised.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.530
Listen, we don't have that much time.

08:35.530 --> 08:37.700
We need to go over your charges. Okay?

08:37.700 --> 08:39.160
- Charges?

08:39.160 --> 08:41.160
What am I even being charged with?

08:41.160 --> 08:44.050
- What you did. Okay.

08:44.050 --> 08:46.720
Here are the charges from
the arresting officer,

08:46.720 --> 08:49.233
aggressive panhandling and assault.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.220
- I didn't do that.

08:52.220 --> 08:53.330
- And you probably didn't

08:53.330 --> 08:56.360
but this officer tends to
exaggerate a little bit

08:56.360 --> 08:58.720
when it comes to filing charges.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.610
- There you go. Right? That's good.

09:00.610 --> 09:01.630
I plead not guilty then.

09:01.630 --> 09:06.300
- Absolutely not. You
plead guilty as charged.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.100
- What?
- You heard me.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.760
You're going to plead guilty.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.370
I'm gonna tell the judge that
this is your first offense

09:12.370 --> 09:14.370
and she's gonna let you walk outta here.

09:15.940 --> 09:19.083
- So a defendant has to
prove that he's innocent?

09:20.070 --> 09:22.220
- You've been watching
too much TV, Mr. Doe.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.500
- Hey, look, I may not remember my name,

09:24.500 --> 09:26.740
but I do know the judicial system.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.983
- Not in this jurisdiction you don't.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.870
You see, if you plead not guilty,

09:31.870 --> 09:33.940
the judge is then gonna
have the arresting officer

09:33.940 --> 09:35.550
come in to testify.

09:35.550 --> 09:36.890
He's gonna be angry.

09:36.890 --> 09:38.940
He's gonna come up with
all these new charges

09:38.940 --> 09:40.873
and she's gonna believe every word of it.

09:44.270 --> 09:45.550
- So I plead guilty?

09:45.550 --> 09:48.903
- You'll plead guilty and apologize.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.653
- I'll plead guilty. And I'll apologize.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.070
Still don't know your name.

09:57.070 --> 09:58.430
- It's almost time for her.

09:58.430 --> 09:59.457
- But what about the-

09:59.457 --> 10:01.840
(man shushes defendant)

10:01.840 --> 10:02.883
- Please rise.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.143
The Honorable Judge
Patterson is now presiding.

10:09.590 --> 10:11.790
- All right, let's move
on to the next case.

10:13.497 --> 10:16.207
The City versus John Doe.

10:18.880 --> 10:19.770
John Doe?

10:19.770 --> 10:21.290
- Yes, your honor we're here.

10:21.290 --> 10:25.203
- Well, I can see that. What's
with this John Doe nonsense?

10:26.100 --> 10:27.230
- Yes, your honor.

10:27.230 --> 10:31.220
The defendant here is suffering
with some memory issues

10:31.220 --> 10:33.350
as a result of a head injury.

10:33.350 --> 10:34.680
- Is that right?

10:34.680 --> 10:35.980
- Yes, your honor.

10:35.980 --> 10:39.150
- I was directing the
question to the defendant.

10:39.150 --> 10:40.050
- Yes, your honor.

10:41.310 --> 10:43.080
- I can't hear you speak up.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.600
- Yes, your honor.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.850
- Oh my God, man. What
happened to your head?

10:48.401 --> 10:49.234
- I got beat up.

10:51.420 --> 10:54.070
- While in custody, I suppose?

10:54.070 --> 10:56.080
- Yeah in my cell. I got beat up.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.640
- And I suppose your head
injury and memory loss

10:58.640 --> 11:01.920
are being blamed on the arresting officer?

11:01.920 --> 11:03.580
- No, no, no. I never said that.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.413
I never said-

11:04.413 --> 11:05.700
- If I may interject your honor,

11:05.700 --> 11:08.690
at no time did the
defendant ever suggest to me

11:08.690 --> 11:12.083
that he was ever a victim of
any kind of police brutality.

11:12.930 --> 11:14.220
- Fine.

11:14.220 --> 11:16.630
So then, the defendant
would have no problem

11:16.630 --> 11:17.910
going on the record stating

11:17.910 --> 11:20.700
that he does not hold the city responsible

11:20.700 --> 11:23.570
for any injuries sustained
while in custody?

11:23.570 --> 11:24.460
- Correct your honor.

11:24.460 --> 11:25.810
- I wanna hear it from him.

11:27.210 --> 11:28.660
- Your honor,

11:28.660 --> 11:30.940
I don't hold the city,
the state responsible.

11:30.940 --> 11:31.940
- Speak up!

11:31.940 --> 11:34.433
- I do not hold the city
or state responsible.

11:35.650 --> 11:38.173
- Including the arresting officer.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.820
- Including the arresting officer.

11:42.740 --> 11:43.573
- Fine.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.453
Now, these charges against you.

11:49.430 --> 11:52.023
Aggressive panhandling and assault.

11:54.170 --> 11:57.840
Can the defendant explain
how he came to be arrested?

11:57.840 --> 12:00.323
- Guilty. I'm guilty. Guilty.

12:01.770 --> 12:03.993
- Did I ask you how you plead?

12:05.000 --> 12:05.833
- No.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.320
- Did I ask your defendant
how he pleads counselor?

12:12.320 --> 12:13.340
- No, your honor.

12:13.340 --> 12:15.163
- No, I did not.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.790
I simply asked the
defendant to explain to me

12:18.790 --> 12:21.166
how he came to be arrested.

12:21.166 --> 12:23.473
- I don't know.

12:23.473 --> 12:24.913
I don't remember.

12:26.190 --> 12:27.323
- Very well then.

12:28.670 --> 12:29.913
- I don't remember.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.223
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.130
- You don't remember?

12:40.040 --> 12:41.773
But you're ready to plead guilty.

12:43.850 --> 12:44.683
- Yeah.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.110
- That doesn't make any sense to me.

12:48.110 --> 12:50.860
Does that make any sense to you counselor?

12:50.860 --> 12:54.110
- Well, the defendant
has the utmost respect

12:54.110 --> 12:55.490
for the arresting officer

12:55.490 --> 12:57.780
and he is willing to accept the charges

12:57.780 --> 13:00.600
that were issued and witnessed by him.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.573
- Bull crap!

13:02.430 --> 13:04.240
You know, I now know

13:04.240 --> 13:07.700
what's going on with all
these memory loss shenanigans.

13:07.700 --> 13:08.580
- Your honor?

13:08.580 --> 13:11.370
- Yes, the defendant was homeless

13:11.370 --> 13:16.180
and yes he was out panhandling
when he saw a police officer

13:16.180 --> 13:18.093
and thought he'd get himself arrested.

13:18.980 --> 13:21.850
Oh and now he wants to
become a ward of the state

13:21.850 --> 13:24.090
so he can get some free mental health care

13:24.090 --> 13:27.126
for this so-called amnesia.

13:27.126 --> 13:28.870
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

13:28.870 --> 13:29.703
I need help.

13:29.703 --> 13:30.620
But no, no.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.470
I'm not gonna be a ward of anybody.

13:32.470 --> 13:34.100
I don't wanna be a ward of anybody.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.420
I don't wanna be a ward of anybody.

13:36.420 --> 13:38.713
- Well, you'll get no help from me.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.730
I'm prepared to accept your plea

13:41.730 --> 13:44.160
and sentence you to the one
night you've already spent

13:44.160 --> 13:45.740
in custody.

13:45.740 --> 13:46.970
- But your honor.

13:46.970 --> 13:47.903
- But nothing.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.713
You know, here's a thought,

13:53.030 --> 13:55.810
why don't you consider
cleaning yourself up,

13:55.810 --> 13:59.063
finding a job and supporting yourself.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.793
Huh? That's a novel
idea. What do you think?

14:05.740 --> 14:06.753
Next case.

14:08.854 --> 14:10.014
John Doe.

14:10.014 --> 14:12.431
(soft music)

15:02.213 --> 15:03.380
- Who are you?

15:06.156 --> 15:07.156
Who are you!

15:17.876 --> 15:20.076
- Hey, you need to wash
more than your face,

15:20.076 --> 15:21.585
you dirty bum!

15:21.585 --> 15:24.418
(water splashing)

15:42.084 --> 15:44.667
(man shouting)

15:46.621 --> 15:49.871
(soft music continues)

15:58.560 --> 16:01.953
- Hey swampy, you hungry?
Got some food left.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.240
Get outta here. Go dig it out the trash.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.729
You lazy bum.

16:07.729 --> 16:10.979
(soft music continues)

16:57.826 --> 17:00.576
(ducks quacking)

17:05.674 --> 17:08.257
(man laughing)

17:17.175 --> 17:18.508
- Anything else?

17:19.513 --> 17:20.680
Anything else?

17:25.645 --> 17:28.062
(soft music)

17:42.295 --> 17:44.878
(man grunting)

17:49.313 --> 17:52.164
(loud thud)
(man grunting)

17:52.164 --> 17:54.747
(man shouting)

17:58.565 --> 18:00.982
(man crying)

18:09.703 --> 18:13.120
(man continues shouting)

18:14.253 --> 18:16.602
(soft music continues in the background)

18:16.602 --> 18:21.102
(man continues grunting and shouting)

18:40.312 --> 18:41.145
- Help!

18:45.154 --> 18:48.404
(soft music continues)

19:04.205 --> 19:06.137
(knock at the door post)

19:06.137 --> 19:07.263
- [Man] Are you open?

19:09.070 --> 19:11.353
- Not for long, we close at five.

19:12.190 --> 19:13.583
- Look, I only need a couple minutes.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.050
- How can I help you?

19:15.050 --> 19:17.010
- I need some assistance.

19:17.010 --> 19:19.142
- How can I help you? With what?

19:19.142 --> 19:20.430
- With what?

19:20.430 --> 19:21.683
Isn't it obvious?

19:23.570 --> 19:26.200
- You'd be surprised how many people

19:26.200 --> 19:27.910
go to their local thrift store,

19:27.910 --> 19:30.600
they buy some rags, they dirty 'em up

19:30.600 --> 19:33.200
and they come in here to
try to scam the government.

19:35.954 --> 19:37.752
- I'm not trying to scam you lady.

19:37.752 --> 19:39.360
I'm not trying to scam you.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.360
I'm not riffraff off the street okay.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.710
- You're gonna have to be more specific.

19:44.710 --> 19:46.190
- Specific?

19:46.190 --> 19:48.750
I'm homeless. I'm hungry.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.973
I haven't eaten in I don't know how long.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.580
- I didn't hear anything at all

19:54.580 --> 19:57.493
about wanting to work, needing a job.

19:58.771 --> 20:00.580
- I'm not afraid to work lady.

20:00.580 --> 20:03.580
All right? I never said I wouldn't work.

20:03.580 --> 20:06.610
- All right, then the first
thing I need is your name.

20:06.610 --> 20:08.190
- I don't know.

20:08.190 --> 20:09.470
Ida-

20:09.470 --> 20:13.963
- First name Ida spelled I D A?

20:16.150 --> 20:17.403
- We're both adults.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.473
I don't play games.

20:22.150 --> 20:25.400
I'm coming in here, being honest with you.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.540
Just need help.

20:26.540 --> 20:28.480
- You're wanting public assistance

20:28.480 --> 20:32.090
without giving me any
kind of identification.

20:32.090 --> 20:34.320
- I have amnesia.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.080
I woke up under a bridge.

20:36.080 --> 20:39.430
I got robbed. I don't
know who did this to me.

20:39.430 --> 20:41.150
I don't know my name.

20:41.150 --> 20:42.650
I don't know who I am.

20:42.650 --> 20:45.660
I don't know if I have a family out there.

20:45.660 --> 20:46.943
I don't know!

20:46.943 --> 20:48.000
I don't know.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.780
I just need help.

20:49.780 --> 20:51.855
Please will you help me?

20:51.855 --> 20:52.810
(woman chuckles)

20:52.810 --> 20:55.980
- You've been walking,
wandering all over this town

20:55.980 --> 20:57.300
with a serious head injury.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.590
- Yes! Because nobody will help me.

20:59.590 --> 21:01.490
Everyone's being cold hearted like you.

21:01.490 --> 21:02.323
Everybody.

21:05.727 --> 21:06.560
Really?

21:09.330 --> 21:11.360
- Sir, it's five o'clock.

21:12.780 --> 21:15.026
Thank you for stopping by.

21:15.026 --> 21:16.546
(bangs table)
- I'm not gonna go.

21:16.546 --> 21:17.797
All right?

21:17.797 --> 21:21.927
How many time do I have to
tell you, I need help? Huh?

21:21.927 --> 21:22.760
Huh?

21:22.760 --> 21:24.343
- Sir.
- How many times?

21:25.194 --> 21:26.300
- All right sir.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.833
- What do you want me to do? Huh?

21:27.833 --> 21:29.100
What do you want me to do? Huh?

21:29.100 --> 21:30.650
Beg? Beg?

21:30.650 --> 21:31.890
Is that what you want?

21:31.890 --> 21:33.330
Is that what you want?

21:33.330 --> 21:35.650
Please help me. Please.

21:35.650 --> 21:37.581
- Sir.
- I need somebody,

21:37.581 --> 21:39.920
who can help me.
- All right. All right.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.805
Sir calm down.
- Please. Just help.

21:42.805 --> 21:44.243
Please. Please. Please.

21:44.243 --> 21:46.650
- Sir, okay, okay, I get it.

21:46.650 --> 21:47.483
- Please.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.090
Please I need help.

21:50.090 --> 21:53.030
- I see that you really need help

21:53.030 --> 21:55.010
but what you need is not my help.

21:55.010 --> 21:57.123
You need medical assistance.

21:58.631 --> 22:01.420
Now, there's a hospital
it has an emergency room,

22:01.420 --> 22:05.203
it's only five blocks away.
(woman sighs)

22:07.423 --> 22:09.590
I drive by on my way home.

22:10.990 --> 22:13.413
So if you're willing
to ride along with me.

22:14.253 --> 22:15.185
- Really?

22:15.185 --> 22:16.018
- Yeah.

22:20.463 --> 22:21.865
Come on.

22:21.865 --> 22:24.424
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

22:24.424 --> 22:25.380
I understand.

22:25.380 --> 22:26.550
That's okay. I'll get it tomorrow.

22:26.550 --> 22:27.873
Don't worry about it.

22:28.926 --> 22:31.343
You need help.

22:37.910 --> 22:41.508
- [Nurse] Sophia. We can see you now.

22:41.508 --> 22:42.341
- It's me.

22:47.890 --> 22:48.723
- I need to talk to you.

22:48.723 --> 22:51.177
- Just a second. I'll be right with you.

22:51.177 --> 22:53.677
(woman sighs)

23:00.055 --> 23:02.600
(soft background music)

23:02.600 --> 23:05.100
- I told the nurse in
charge about your situation.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.460
She said she'd have the doctor look at you

23:08.460 --> 23:10.233
just as soon as he can.

23:12.150 --> 23:16.210
I told her that you didn't know your name

23:17.396 --> 23:19.860
and that you don't have an ability to pay.

23:19.860 --> 23:24.087
So, she's opening up a
case file under John Doe.

23:25.185 --> 23:26.102
- John Doe.

23:30.115 --> 23:30.948
Thank you.

23:31.930 --> 23:32.953
You're an angel.

23:34.036 --> 23:36.590
- Well, you're gonna have
to be patient, you know,

23:36.590 --> 23:37.833
no pun intended.

23:39.850 --> 23:40.683
They're gonna work you in

23:40.683 --> 23:42.790
just as soon as the doctor can get you in.

23:42.790 --> 23:45.516
It might be awhile. Okay?

23:45.516 --> 23:46.485
- You're an angel.

23:46.485 --> 23:48.620
(woman chuckles)
- Good luck.

23:48.620 --> 23:49.670
- Thank you.
- Okay.

23:51.206 --> 23:54.456
(soft music continues)

23:57.745 --> 24:00.078
(man cries)

24:23.340 --> 24:24.240
- Open your mouth.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.130
(man sighs)

24:26.130 --> 24:26.963
Oh yeah. Okay.

24:28.790 --> 24:30.300
Okay.

24:30.300 --> 24:32.497
Put your chin down to your chest.

24:32.497 --> 24:33.330
Okay.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.130
(man cries out softly)
Oh yeah.

24:39.130 --> 24:39.963
Oh right there.

24:39.963 --> 24:41.510
Yeah. There's a pretty
big lump right there.

24:41.510 --> 24:43.420
That looks pretty painful.

24:43.420 --> 24:44.253
- Mh-mm it hurts.

24:44.253 --> 24:45.260
- Okay. Okay.

24:45.260 --> 24:47.060
Bring your head back up. Okay.

24:47.060 --> 24:49.800
Any dizziness at all? Any blurred vision?

24:49.800 --> 24:52.730
- I got blurred vision but I
don't know if I need glasses.

24:52.730 --> 24:53.810
I can't remember.

24:53.810 --> 24:54.643
- Okay.

24:54.643 --> 24:57.139
Any indigestion? You're
sick to your stomach at all?

24:57.139 --> 24:57.972
- I don't know.

24:57.972 --> 24:59.087
I haven't eaten.

24:59.087 --> 25:00.742
- But you still have an appetite?

25:00.742 --> 25:01.792
- Oh yeah I'm hungry.

25:03.570 --> 25:04.403
- Okay.

25:06.100 --> 25:09.950
Okay. Mr. Doe, I think
you've had a concussion.

25:09.950 --> 25:10.870
Okay.

25:10.870 --> 25:14.170
I'm going to order a CT scan for you,

25:14.170 --> 25:17.240
to see if you had any
more damage to your skull

25:17.240 --> 25:18.200
or your brain.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.130
- So I'll be staying here
at the hospital, right?

25:20.130 --> 25:20.990
- I don't know.

25:20.990 --> 25:22.630
I can't tell you that right now.

25:22.630 --> 25:24.990
It'll depend on what the CT scan shows.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.860
We'll be looking for
bleeding in the brain.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.333
We'll be looking for increased
intracranial pressure.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.950
- I thought anybody with
a head injury stays here.

25:32.950 --> 25:34.630
- Not necessarily. Okay.

25:34.630 --> 25:37.470
Let's see what, we'll take
it one step at a time.

25:37.470 --> 25:40.200
Let's see what the CT scan says. Okay?

25:40.200 --> 25:42.090
And then we'll take it from there.

25:42.090 --> 25:43.870
- So frustrating.

25:43.870 --> 25:45.600
I just wanna get my life back.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.350
I just wanna know who I am.

25:47.350 --> 25:48.680
I wanna go home.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.890
- [Doctor] Yeah.
- Frustrating.

25:50.890 --> 25:54.305
- Yeah. Well let's get the
CT scan one thing at a time.

25:54.305 --> 25:56.070
Okay. CT scan.

25:56.070 --> 25:57.710
We'll see what's going on there.

25:57.710 --> 25:59.710
And then-
- Thank you.

25:59.710 --> 26:02.100
- I'll be out to the waiting
room to see how you're doing.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.697
Okay.
- This is so frustrating.

26:03.697 --> 26:05.490
So frustrating.

26:05.490 --> 26:06.574
- I'll see you in a little bit.

26:06.574 --> 26:07.574
- All right.

26:12.410 --> 26:14.033
- Please lie down Mr Doe.

26:25.270 --> 26:26.980
- Mr. Doe? You're awake?

26:26.980 --> 26:27.813
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

26:27.813 --> 26:29.290
Good, good.

26:29.290 --> 26:31.100
I'm glad you're getting
some rest out here.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.470
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26:32.470 --> 26:34.760
Well, I got the results of the CT scan.

26:34.760 --> 26:38.920
You do have a little bit
of a skull fracture. Okay?

26:38.920 --> 26:40.890
That should heal up on its own.

26:40.890 --> 26:45.100
And happily there was no
damage to your brain. Okay?

26:45.100 --> 26:47.660
And the scratches and
the cuts on your head,

26:47.660 --> 26:50.113
I really don't think they require sutures.

26:51.620 --> 26:52.453
- Okay.

26:53.310 --> 26:56.070
So my memory? When is that coming back?

26:56.070 --> 26:57.913
- Okay. Well the amnesia.

27:00.290 --> 27:03.000
I'm not a brain surgeon or a psychiatrist.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.770
What I think you've got
is post-traumatic amnesia.

27:06.770 --> 27:10.100
Okay.
Now, post-traumatic amnesia,

27:10.100 --> 27:12.820
your memory'll probably come
back in a couple of weeks.

27:12.820 --> 27:16.740
But total memory, it may
take a couple of months.

27:16.740 --> 27:17.930
- Two months?

27:17.930 --> 27:19.297
- Possibly.
- Two months?

27:19.297 --> 27:21.600
- Possibly. Possibly.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.665
Now, I've got some ibuprofen here for you,

27:24.665 --> 27:29.470
for your headaches and your
pain you're having there.

27:29.470 --> 27:33.540
Plus I think we should get
a hold of social services

27:33.540 --> 27:35.910
to get you into a homeless shelter.

27:35.910 --> 27:40.617
You'll heal up a lot faster
if you're out of the elements.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.020
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:42.020 --> 27:44.030
Now I do have some good news.

27:44.030 --> 27:44.980
- Yeah?

27:44.980 --> 27:46.080
- Your jaw looks fine.

27:48.809 --> 27:50.900
- Yeah. Thank you.

27:50.900 --> 27:52.136
- Best wishes to you, sir.

27:52.136 --> 27:53.136
- Thank you.

27:59.668 --> 28:01.000
(man sighs)

28:01.000 --> 28:03.417
(soft music)

28:13.409 --> 28:16.208
- Dude, you're like a zombie.

28:16.208 --> 28:17.927
Man you need this.

28:17.927 --> 28:21.177
(soft music continues)

28:50.928 --> 28:53.261
(loud bang)

29:36.357 --> 29:38.690
(loud thud)

29:45.682 --> 29:49.432
(dramatic beat sound effect)

29:55.405 --> 29:57.822
(man crying)

30:00.856 --> 30:03.004
- Why don't you just
light that thing already?

30:03.004 --> 30:03.985
(indistinct)

30:03.985 --> 30:04.818
You're driving me nuts.

30:04.818 --> 30:07.216
(indistinct)

30:07.216 --> 30:08.049
I get it.

30:08.049 --> 30:09.357
(indistinct) Hey!

30:09.357 --> 30:11.774
The lid's open.

30:16.390 --> 30:18.441
- What are you doing in our dumpster?

30:18.441 --> 30:20.840
- Look, I'm just hungry.

30:20.840 --> 30:21.980
I'm just hungry. Okay.

30:21.980 --> 30:23.413
- You don't know who's dumpster this is?

30:23.413 --> 30:25.210
- This is ours.
- Ours.

30:25.210 --> 30:26.590
You don't belong here.

30:26.590 --> 30:27.460
- Mister, don't you know?

30:27.460 --> 30:29.410
- Everybody around here knows that.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.690
- [Man] I'm just hungry.

30:30.690 --> 30:32.680
- Uh-uh, you listen to me,
you get out of my dumpster.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.200
- Look look, there's
plenty for us to share.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.620
- No.
- That's our pizza man.

30:36.620 --> 30:37.453
- I'll bring it up.

30:37.453 --> 30:38.286
I'll bring up.
- No that's ours.

30:38.286 --> 30:39.840
- We don't share. It's our dumpster.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.014
- You're gonna have to
do something. Shut it.

30:42.014 --> 30:44.597
(man shouting)

30:45.448 --> 30:46.976
- Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

30:46.976 --> 30:48.608
- [Man] What are you doing?

30:48.608 --> 30:50.354
- We'll teach him a lesson (indistinct)

30:50.354 --> 30:51.276
- (indistinct) a lesson yeah.

30:51.276 --> 30:53.995
- What are you doing?
(indistinct)

30:53.995 --> 30:57.166
- [Man] Hey! Let me out.

30:57.166 --> 30:59.006
Let me out.

30:59.006 --> 31:01.459
(banging on bin)
Let me out.

31:01.459 --> 31:05.007
(thunder roaring)

31:05.007 --> 31:08.257
(truck engine revving)

31:10.260 --> 31:12.729
- Hold on. Somebody put a
pallet in front of the dumpster.

31:12.729 --> 31:15.979
(truck engine roaring)

31:23.707 --> 31:26.129
(man screaming)

31:26.129 --> 31:27.712
- [Man] Let me out.

31:30.450 --> 31:32.124
Let me out.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.041
Let me out.

31:34.486 --> 31:35.403
Let me out.

31:40.227 --> 31:44.894
- I see the problem, somebody
jammed the rod in the lid.

31:46.106 --> 31:47.273
What the heck?

31:48.446 --> 31:50.537
What are you doing in
there? Get outta there.

31:50.537 --> 31:52.257
- Somebody locked me in.

31:52.257 --> 31:53.396
- Well get outta there.

31:53.396 --> 31:55.615
- Oh, I can't get up.

31:55.615 --> 31:56.448
My leg.

31:56.448 --> 31:57.734
- I said get out of the dumpster now.

31:57.734 --> 31:58.901
- Aah, my leg.

32:00.054 --> 32:01.065
My leg.

32:01.065 --> 32:02.503
(man groaning)

32:02.503 --> 32:07.503
(loud thud)
(man shouting)

32:07.795 --> 32:10.385
(man shouting)

32:10.385 --> 32:12.475
(man crying)

32:12.475 --> 32:13.308
- Now get.

32:14.384 --> 32:16.801
(soft music)

32:36.806 --> 32:40.065
(man shouting)

32:40.065 --> 32:43.315
(soft music continues)

32:55.773 --> 32:58.862
- [Doctor] I've got some
Ibuprofen here for you.

32:58.862 --> 33:03.612
(soft music continues in the background)

33:31.790 --> 33:34.207
(indistinct)

34:13.870 --> 34:16.453
(man shouting)

34:20.102 --> 34:21.269
Somebody help!

34:23.780 --> 34:27.030
(soft music continues)

34:42.523 --> 34:46.283
(heart beat sound effect)

34:46.283 --> 34:48.200
Tired of nobody caring!

34:49.870 --> 34:51.603
Nobody cares.

34:54.950 --> 34:57.313
I don't even care who I am anymore.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.433
You win!

35:01.370 --> 35:03.283
I'm done, you win.

35:03.283 --> 35:05.741
(heart beat sound effect)

35:05.741 --> 35:08.658
(trumpet sounding)

35:11.611 --> 35:14.283
(man shouting)

35:14.283 --> 35:15.911
Who are you? Huh?

35:15.911 --> 35:16.911
Who are you?

35:17.873 --> 35:19.651
(man laughs)
Who are you?

35:19.651 --> 35:20.742
Who are you boy?

35:20.742 --> 35:22.770
Huh? What do you want? Huh?

35:22.770 --> 35:23.620
What do you want?

35:25.311 --> 35:27.170
(dog barking)

35:27.170 --> 35:28.244
What?

35:28.244 --> 35:31.744
(dog whining and barking)

35:34.250 --> 35:35.340
I'm leaving!

35:35.340 --> 35:36.422
(dog continues barking)

35:36.422 --> 35:37.255
I'm going.

35:38.142 --> 35:40.084
That's what you wanted.

35:40.084 --> 35:43.483
I know it's your bridge. I'll
throw myself off over here.

35:43.483 --> 35:46.484
Okay?
(dog barking)

35:46.484 --> 35:47.317
What?

35:48.284 --> 35:49.500
That way?

35:49.500 --> 35:51.341
Oh you want me to go with you?

35:51.341 --> 35:52.302
That's what you want?

35:52.302 --> 35:55.635
(dog continues barking)

35:56.921 --> 35:59.153
I'm listening to a dog.

35:59.153 --> 36:01.713
I'm talking to a dog now.

36:01.713 --> 36:02.796
I've lost it.

36:04.696 --> 36:07.613
(triumphant music)

36:19.750 --> 36:21.053
It says no pets.

36:22.890 --> 36:24.190
I didn't make these rules.

36:26.360 --> 36:27.193
I didn't.

36:28.306 --> 36:30.950
Looks like you're gonna
have to stay outside.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.423
You sit and stay, okay?

36:33.500 --> 36:35.010
Deal?

36:35.010 --> 36:35.843
Yeah?

36:36.696 --> 36:39.186
I'll be right back, okay?

36:39.186 --> 36:42.019
(classical music)

36:53.322 --> 36:55.655
(man sighs)

37:00.923 --> 37:03.506
(gentle music)

37:06.413 --> 37:07.246
Hello?

37:08.340 --> 37:09.173
- Sir.

37:10.070 --> 37:11.250
You look injured.

37:11.250 --> 37:12.760
Come on in.

37:12.760 --> 37:13.593
Have a seat.

37:14.475 --> 37:15.355
- Thank you.

37:15.355 --> 37:16.855
Thank you, Father.

37:18.750 --> 37:20.350
- So what brings you here today?

37:21.662 --> 37:22.495
(man chuckles)

37:22.495 --> 37:25.750
- Would you believe, a dog?

37:25.750 --> 37:26.770
- [Pastor] Excuse me.

37:26.770 --> 37:27.700
- Yeah.

37:27.700 --> 37:29.033
A dog brought me here.

37:30.090 --> 37:31.563
I was at my lowest point.

37:33.210 --> 37:34.623
I was ready to give up.

37:36.380 --> 37:37.683
I was ready to end it all.

37:39.904 --> 37:41.123
And a dog,

37:42.360 --> 37:43.963
brought me off those rails.

37:44.872 --> 37:47.160
A dog led me here.

37:47.160 --> 37:50.412
- So you're saying a dog saved your life?

37:50.412 --> 37:51.590
(man chuckles)

37:51.590 --> 37:53.020
- Yeah.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.180
It's not much of a life though.

37:55.180 --> 37:58.003
It's a life I wouldn't even
wish on my worst enemy.

37:58.980 --> 38:00.260
- Well, that's nonsense.

38:00.260 --> 38:02.030
God didn't put you into this life

38:02.030 --> 38:04.290
for you just to end it on your own.

38:04.290 --> 38:05.960
- Oh yeah?
- [Pastor] Yeah.

38:05.960 --> 38:09.070
- If I was so important
to God, explain this.

38:09.070 --> 38:12.830
Why would a God, let me
get injured in this way?

38:12.830 --> 38:14.770
Why would a God have
me walking the streets,

38:14.770 --> 38:16.420
not knowing my own name?

38:16.420 --> 38:19.070
Not knowing if I have a
family, if I have kids.

38:19.070 --> 38:22.560
Why would a God have me
living under a bridge?

38:22.560 --> 38:25.970
Why would God let people be so mean to me,

38:25.970 --> 38:27.160
that they won't even help me

38:27.160 --> 38:29.120
when I ask a question, huh?

38:29.120 --> 38:30.620
Explain that Pastor.

38:30.620 --> 38:32.700
- Well, I know this is not the time

38:32.700 --> 38:35.830
that you want me to say that
God works in mysterious ways,

38:35.830 --> 38:37.130
but He does.

38:37.130 --> 38:39.130
- Mysterious ways?

38:39.130 --> 38:39.963
- Yes.

38:39.963 --> 38:41.600
- You got that right Father.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.203
Mysterious ways.

38:46.150 --> 38:47.573
- Well, are you hungry?

38:49.518 --> 38:50.358
(gentle music)

38:50.358 --> 38:51.870
- Yeah.
- Mmh?

38:51.870 --> 38:53.640
- I'm really hungry.

38:53.640 --> 38:54.473
- Well you sit right there,

38:54.473 --> 38:56.430
'cause I'm going to get you some food

38:56.430 --> 38:58.040
and I'm also gonna take you down

38:58.040 --> 38:59.660
to the clothes donation room.

38:59.660 --> 39:01.960
And we're gon' get you
something nice to wear.

39:02.824 --> 39:06.241
(gentle music continues)

39:17.210 --> 39:19.563
Here you are. I hope
this is to your liking.

39:20.474 --> 39:21.915
- Thank you.
- Here's your spoon

39:21.915 --> 39:22.973
and a napkin.

39:22.973 --> 39:25.023
- Thank you. Thank you.

39:25.023 --> 39:26.013
- Well, you eat up.

39:26.013 --> 39:27.013
- All right.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.466
- [Pastor] And I'll be back.

39:34.666 --> 39:37.315
(soft music)
- Hey, I got you something.

39:37.315 --> 39:39.855
I brought you something.

39:39.855 --> 39:41.353
I told you, I wouldn't forget you.

39:41.353 --> 39:44.603
(soft music continues)

39:52.842 --> 39:53.973
That good?

39:53.973 --> 39:56.520
You eat that, okay?

39:56.520 --> 39:59.500
I got to go talk to this
preacher man, all right?

39:59.500 --> 40:03.823
When I get back, I'll play
with you some more okay?

40:07.600 --> 40:08.433
Father.

40:08.433 --> 40:10.720
- Oh, you've returned.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.373
Well, I thought we'd lost you for good.

40:13.373 --> 40:14.470
- No, I'm back.

40:14.470 --> 40:19.470
I told you I'd come back
and finish our conversation.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.650
So, I'm here.

40:20.650 --> 40:23.610
- This is a time when I usually ask,

40:23.610 --> 40:24.880
people what their name is,

40:24.880 --> 40:27.710
but I know you can't tell me that.

40:27.710 --> 40:30.403
- Nah, I went to the doctors recently.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.480
They said it could be possibly weeks,

40:34.480 --> 40:37.330
or months before I get my memory back.

40:37.330 --> 40:39.090
Months.

40:39.090 --> 40:41.760
- All right, so presently
you have no recollection

40:41.760 --> 40:45.530
of who you were prior to your injuries?

40:45.530 --> 40:47.840
- That's what makes me upset.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.790
That's what makes me question my faith.

40:50.790 --> 40:52.420
- Have you been born again?

40:52.420 --> 40:54.123
Have you been saved?

40:56.260 --> 40:58.700
- Like, Jesus Bible thumping saved?

40:58.700 --> 41:00.070
Is that what you're talking about?

41:00.070 --> 41:02.950
- No, just born again.

41:02.950 --> 41:04.690
Accepted Christ.

41:04.690 --> 41:05.523
- Nah.

41:08.112 --> 41:09.200
- But this is different.

41:09.200 --> 41:10.670
If you was born again,

41:10.670 --> 41:13.230
Jesus has entered your heart and soul

41:13.230 --> 41:15.053
and he still should be there.

41:16.230 --> 41:18.290
- I know what you want me to say.

41:18.290 --> 41:20.990
I know what you're leaning towards.

41:20.990 --> 41:24.050
You want me to validate your faith, right?

41:24.050 --> 41:26.830
- I remember the day
Christ entered my life.

41:26.830 --> 41:28.630
But even if I didn't,

41:28.630 --> 41:31.330
I would think I was still
know that he was there,

41:31.330 --> 41:34.690
guiding everything I do and say.

41:34.690 --> 41:36.363
- I'd like to think I was saved.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.783
I don't know.

41:40.783 --> 41:41.733
- Well do you pray?

41:42.840 --> 41:43.703
- Haven't prayed,

41:44.820 --> 41:46.033
since this happened.

41:46.970 --> 41:49.890
Maybe I prayed before this all happened.

41:49.890 --> 41:50.723
Maybe.

41:50.723 --> 41:52.093
I like to think I did.

41:53.170 --> 41:54.873
I think maybe in my heart I did.

41:55.910 --> 41:57.940
- Even with your recent loss of memory,

41:57.940 --> 42:01.810
I would have thought you would
have at least tried prayer.

42:01.810 --> 42:05.053
Especially if you had previously
been introduced to Christ.

42:05.970 --> 42:08.183
- Previously introduced to Christ.

42:09.310 --> 42:10.143
Look at me.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.473
Look at me, Father.

42:13.610 --> 42:16.290
Do I look like a Christian to you?

42:16.290 --> 42:17.123
Look at me.

42:17.123 --> 42:19.630
Take a good hard look.

42:19.630 --> 42:24.590
I am the image of someone
who doesn't follow God.

42:24.590 --> 42:25.900
Look at this.

42:25.900 --> 42:28.940
I woke up and look what's on my hands.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.583
Look, what's on my face.

42:31.480 --> 42:34.840
These are gang tattoos on my face.

42:34.840 --> 42:37.480
Is this a man who follows God?

42:37.480 --> 42:42.360
Is this a man who sits in here and prays?

42:42.360 --> 42:44.940
- Well, looks can be deceiving.

42:44.940 --> 42:49.540
You know, you seem like a
real kind and gentle man.

42:49.540 --> 42:52.810
A head injury doesn't
bring about sudden empathy.

42:52.810 --> 42:55.120
(man chuckles)

42:55.120 --> 42:56.503
- A thoughtful, gentleman.

42:57.580 --> 42:58.413
Hmm.

42:59.810 --> 43:01.910
Yeah, sure.

43:01.910 --> 43:03.253
Thoughtful, gentleman.

43:04.800 --> 43:06.340
Yeah.

43:06.340 --> 43:08.887
I wish no ill will towards anybody.

43:08.887 --> 43:11.083
And I have no malice in my heart.

43:12.680 --> 43:14.743
I even feel sorry for those that do.

43:16.490 --> 43:19.080
- As Christ was dying on the cross,

43:19.080 --> 43:21.850
he forgave them that tormented him.

43:21.850 --> 43:26.223
You have the same attribute
that Christ has, in you.

43:27.250 --> 43:29.290
- So what you're saying,

43:29.290 --> 43:32.530
is that if you don't
accept Christ in your heart

43:32.530 --> 43:36.500
you can't be a good person, a
kind person, a giving person?

43:36.500 --> 43:38.130
Is that what you're telling me?

43:38.130 --> 43:40.310
- No, I'm not saying that.

43:40.310 --> 43:42.860
There is plenty of agnostics people

43:42.860 --> 43:45.810
that are kind and good and loving.

43:45.810 --> 43:50.810
But your, your personality
seems more resident

43:51.490 --> 43:53.183
with Christian faith.

43:55.249 --> 43:56.733
- I'd like think I was saved.

43:57.850 --> 44:00.890
I'd like to think I'm that
person that you think I am.

44:00.890 --> 44:03.550
- [Pastor] Well, let's pray.

44:03.550 --> 44:05.700
(gentle music)

44:05.700 --> 44:07.360
Dear God,

44:07.360 --> 44:10.250
help this gentle and kind man,

44:10.250 --> 44:13.113
realize who he is in Christ.

44:14.200 --> 44:16.680
And bring his fond memories back

44:16.680 --> 44:19.550
of the life he lived before.

44:19.550 --> 44:24.023
And help him remember
those glorious times.

44:25.180 --> 44:27.300
In Christ Jesus name,

44:27.300 --> 44:28.480
I pray.

44:28.480 --> 44:29.782
Amen.

44:29.782 --> 44:31.932
(man crying)

44:31.932 --> 44:33.732
- I really have nowhere to stay.

44:35.140 --> 44:38.200
- Well, I assume you would
like a bed for the night.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.940
In the morning,

44:39.940 --> 44:42.290
I'd hope you would join us in a chapel,

44:42.290 --> 44:43.123
for a sermon.

44:44.170 --> 44:45.003
- All right.

44:46.040 --> 44:46.963
I'll be there.

44:48.272 --> 44:49.393
I'll be there.

44:49.393 --> 44:51.976
(gentle music)

45:23.012 --> 45:25.833
(gentle upbeat music)

45:25.833 --> 45:30.053
I don't know if I prayed
to you in the past.

45:32.220 --> 45:33.223
I hope I did.

45:34.500 --> 45:36.667
I see a bad man in the mirror,

45:38.534 --> 45:39.983
and I hope that's not me.

45:43.040 --> 45:45.083
I hope I haven't hurt others.

45:49.190 --> 45:50.603
I need to know who I am.

45:52.270 --> 45:55.573
I need to know what I've done.

45:58.030 --> 46:00.351
Why, I deserve this?

46:00.351 --> 46:04.351
(gentle upbeat music continues)

46:30.330 --> 46:32.450
- I'm sorry, we don't have any hymnals

46:32.450 --> 46:34.670
or musical accompaniment.

46:34.670 --> 46:38.110
But if you know the words to this hymn.

46:38.110 --> 46:39.493
I'd like you to sing along.

47:41.560 --> 47:45.040
- One of the miracles that
God gives us every day,

47:45.040 --> 47:46.353
is a birth of a child.

47:47.300 --> 47:49.690
Whether it be the birth of a son,

47:49.690 --> 47:50.583
or a daughter,

47:51.980 --> 47:53.523
or a grandchild,

47:54.700 --> 47:55.853
or our own birth,

47:56.780 --> 48:00.650
of course no one asked us
if we wanted to be born

48:00.650 --> 48:03.300
or to whom we wanted born.

48:03.300 --> 48:05.860
From the moment we left the womb,

48:05.860 --> 48:09.260
we were suddenly thrust
into an environment

48:09.260 --> 48:11.890
where we needed to learn to survive.

48:11.890 --> 48:15.010
We may have been born into a poor family

48:15.010 --> 48:16.830
or an abusive family,

48:16.830 --> 48:19.420
and wonder why did God place us there?

48:19.420 --> 48:23.170
Instead of a grand mansion,

48:23.170 --> 48:27.370
with nannies who would
feed us the best baby food

48:27.370 --> 48:30.700
from silver spoons and fine China.

48:30.700 --> 48:33.540
But the greatest of God's miracles,

48:33.540 --> 48:37.490
is not our physical birth
but our spiritual birth.

48:37.490 --> 48:41.020
Yes, I say the spiritual
birth of a lost sinner

48:41.020 --> 48:45.540
into a spiritual life is
the most miraculous gift

48:45.540 --> 48:47.910
that God can give to mankind.

48:47.910 --> 48:52.370
So why is spiritual birth more miraculous

48:52.370 --> 48:53.930
than physical birth?

48:53.930 --> 48:55.130
Huh?

48:55.130 --> 48:57.810
Because when we are born again,

48:57.810 --> 49:02.550
God allows us to escape the
pains of death in this life

49:02.550 --> 49:06.063
and grants us eternal life in heaven.

49:09.037 --> 49:10.320
(gentle music)

49:10.320 --> 49:12.810
You know, when I was in seminary,

49:12.810 --> 49:16.830
Father Daniels asked us
to describe the feeling

49:16.830 --> 49:19.220
of being born again.

49:19.220 --> 49:22.273
As students, well we
knew we were born again

49:22.273 --> 49:24.163
and had Christ in our hearts.

49:25.060 --> 49:29.902
But man, we had great difficulty
putting that into words.

49:29.902 --> 49:31.020
(Pastor chuckles)

49:31.020 --> 49:33.383
You know, I still have
my notes from that day.

49:35.700 --> 49:37.220
I still have them right here.

49:39.200 --> 49:44.200
And this is how father Daniels
explained the spiritual state

49:44.260 --> 49:46.043
of being born again.

49:47.087 --> 49:50.530
"To be born again doesn't
mean that a good person

49:50.530 --> 49:52.280
just becomes more of a good person.

49:53.512 --> 49:56.923
Or the immoral person just
becomes more of a moral person.

49:58.190 --> 49:59.290
Or that a church member

49:59.290 --> 50:01.733
becomes an even better church member.

50:02.890 --> 50:05.220
To be born again means,

50:05.220 --> 50:08.030
that a spiritually bankrupt person,

50:08.030 --> 50:11.983
gains all the promises and
blessings that God promises

50:13.000 --> 50:14.950
to those who are his.

50:14.950 --> 50:18.480
It means that a totally
depraved wicked person

50:18.480 --> 50:22.123
is completely cleansed
of all his or her sins.

50:23.070 --> 50:26.950
It means that a person who
has absolutely nothing to give

50:26.950 --> 50:30.620
to God, can receive the greatest gift

50:30.620 --> 50:32.660
that they possibly can receive.

50:32.660 --> 50:34.980
And that is eternal life.

50:34.980 --> 50:37.400
It means that someone who's completely

50:37.400 --> 50:40.230
and totally rotten to the core,

50:40.230 --> 50:41.833
can become a child of God.

50:43.180 --> 50:46.210
Who is that spiritually bankrupt person,

50:46.210 --> 50:47.773
that is rotten to the core,

50:47.773 --> 50:50.580
that has nothing to offer God?

50:50.580 --> 50:52.650
That person is you.

50:52.650 --> 50:54.323
And that person is me.

50:55.310 --> 51:00.310
Now I would like to read
from the book of John 3:1-8.

51:03.480 --> 51:06.513
Now there was a Pharisee,
a man named Nicodemus.

51:07.770 --> 51:10.583
Who's a member of the
Jewish ruling counsel.

51:11.590 --> 51:14.687
He came to Jesus at night and said,

51:14.687 --> 51:19.253
"Rabbi, I know you're a
teacher, a man from God.

51:20.420 --> 51:23.680
For no one could perform
the signs you are doing,

51:23.680 --> 51:25.630
if God were not with him".

51:25.630 --> 51:29.630
Jesus replied, "Very truly I tell you,

51:29.630 --> 51:31.600
no one can see the kingdom of God

51:32.570 --> 51:34.784
unless they are born again."

51:34.784 --> 51:37.860
"How can someone be born
again when they're old?"

51:37.860 --> 51:39.317
Nicodemus, says.

51:39.317 --> 51:42.110
"Surely they can not enter a second time,

51:42.110 --> 51:45.240
in their mother's womb to be born".

51:45.240 --> 51:46.357
Jesus answered,

51:46.357 --> 51:48.310
"Very truly, I tell you,

51:48.310 --> 51:51.080
no one can enter the kingdom of God,

51:51.080 --> 51:55.230
unless they are born of
water and the spirit.

51:55.230 --> 51:58.020
Flesh gives birth to flesh

51:58.020 --> 52:02.490
but the spirit gives birth to spirit.

52:02.490 --> 52:05.810
You should not be surprised by my saying,

52:05.810 --> 52:07.503
you must be born again.

52:08.500 --> 52:11.870
The wind blows wherever it pleases.

52:14.160 --> 52:15.760
You hear its sound,

52:15.760 --> 52:18.840
but you cannot tell where it comes from

52:18.840 --> 52:20.730
or where it's going.

52:20.730 --> 52:24.567
So it is with everyone
born of the spirit."

52:26.140 --> 52:27.730
Tell me brothers,

52:27.730 --> 52:29.460
is there anyone here,

52:29.460 --> 52:32.210
who wants to hear the sanctifying sound

52:32.210 --> 52:35.550
of God's breath blowing
through their soul?

52:37.017 --> 52:39.600
(gentle music)

53:14.988 --> 53:15.905
- Here boy!

53:18.929 --> 53:21.398
(man whistles)

53:21.398 --> 53:22.231
Here boy!

53:33.056 --> 53:33.889
Here boy!

53:36.066 --> 53:36.899
Here boy!

53:39.049 --> 53:39.882
Here boy!

53:41.918 --> 53:44.501
(gentle music)

53:51.438 --> 53:52.271
Here boy.

53:59.289 --> 54:00.628
There you are.

54:00.628 --> 54:01.958
There you are.

54:01.958 --> 54:02.817
There you are.

54:02.817 --> 54:04.129
Don't you leave me.

54:04.129 --> 54:05.848
Don't you leave me, okay?

54:05.848 --> 54:07.598
We're partners, okay?

54:08.856 --> 54:10.049
Okay?

54:10.049 --> 54:11.449
Don't leave me again.

54:11.449 --> 54:14.866
(gentle music continues)

54:56.417 --> 54:59.584
(gentle upbeat music)

55:42.817 --> 55:44.297
(man sobbing)

55:44.297 --> 55:46.598
I don't know how to do this.

55:46.598 --> 55:49.409
I don't know if I am doing this right.

55:49.409 --> 55:52.659
(man continues to sob)

55:55.033 --> 55:56.293
A dog brought me here.

55:58.340 --> 56:00.153
Dog brought me off the ledge.

56:03.370 --> 56:04.443
Dog saved my life.

56:05.585 --> 56:08.168
(gentle music)

56:13.348 --> 56:15.431
I don't understand a God,

56:17.400 --> 56:19.663
a God who would do this to me.

56:24.530 --> 56:26.760
A God who would leave me severely beaten

56:26.760 --> 56:28.633
that I don't even know who I am.

56:32.410 --> 56:35.003
Why are you doing this to me?

56:38.398 --> 56:39.565
What did I do?

56:45.017 --> 56:47.100
Do you hate me that much?

56:48.287 --> 56:49.870
Why do you hate me?

56:56.980 --> 56:57.813
Pastor asked me,

56:59.287 --> 57:00.987
if I've invited you into my heart?

57:03.720 --> 57:04.923
If I've been born again?

57:06.486 --> 57:07.986
I don't even know.

57:09.895 --> 57:11.423
I can't answer him.

57:17.160 --> 57:20.073
He says I should know even
if I don't have a memory.

57:25.916 --> 57:28.499
I wish I could but I can't lie,

57:29.990 --> 57:31.633
to validate his faith.

57:34.025 --> 57:36.175
I don't even know if
I've done this before.

57:41.145 --> 57:44.395
(man continues to sob)

57:47.025 --> 57:48.108
I'm here now.

57:49.960 --> 57:51.003
I'm here now.

57:54.434 --> 57:56.101
Make yourself known.

58:04.165 --> 58:05.630
Tell me you're there besides me,

58:05.630 --> 58:06.774
guiding me,

58:06.774 --> 58:08.971
walking next to me.

58:08.971 --> 58:11.380
It's hard and I don't wanna be alone.

58:11.380 --> 58:13.153
I don't wanna be alone.

58:17.252 --> 58:21.270
(indistinct) hard it is.

58:21.270 --> 58:23.187
I don't wanna be alone.

58:25.855 --> 58:28.438
(gentle music)

58:34.608 --> 58:36.275
Tell me you love me.

59:17.627 --> 59:20.044
(indistinct)

59:21.280 --> 59:23.235
Woo! Man.

59:23.235 --> 59:24.753
- Nice dog.

59:25.835 --> 59:28.170
All right man, where are you from man?

59:28.170 --> 59:30.675
- Here, there, everywhere.

59:30.675 --> 59:31.508
You know what I mean?

59:31.508 --> 59:32.673
Just tryna stay warm, bro.

59:33.670 --> 59:34.710
Find some food.

59:34.710 --> 59:35.750
- I hear you, man.

59:35.750 --> 59:37.860
- Yeah.
- What'd you do, man?

59:37.860 --> 59:39.180
- Man, I'm a groundskeeper man.

59:39.180 --> 59:41.750
I'm picking up trash and dog poop all day.

59:41.750 --> 59:43.303
In this huge big old park.

59:44.520 --> 59:46.460
Yeah.
- How is it, man?

59:46.460 --> 59:47.970
Is it as awesome as I think it is?

59:47.970 --> 59:49.450
- I don't know, man.

59:49.450 --> 59:53.420
I mean, (chuckles) it's
no fresh air really

59:53.420 --> 59:55.650
because you got a smelly bag of garbage

59:55.650 --> 59:56.870
you're carrying around all day,

59:56.870 --> 59:59.890
and putting strain on your arms and back.

59:59.890 --> 1:00:01.430
- I would die.
- Plus,

1:00:01.430 --> 1:00:05.370
the manager, pays me 30 bucks a day.

1:00:05.370 --> 1:00:06.490
- Cash?

1:00:06.490 --> 1:00:08.493
- Yeah, but it's under the table?

1:00:09.370 --> 1:00:12.893
She thinks that she's helping
out the underprivileged.

1:00:13.900 --> 1:00:16.810
People like me, who is doing her job,

1:00:16.810 --> 1:00:19.500
while she kicks back in
her air conditioned office.

1:00:19.500 --> 1:00:21.770
- Let me tell you something, brother.

1:00:21.770 --> 1:00:23.700
Look at the beauty out here.

1:00:23.700 --> 1:00:25.250
I don't care it's raining, bro.

1:00:26.820 --> 1:00:28.823
This is God's creation, man.

1:00:30.420 --> 1:00:31.550
I would die.

1:00:31.550 --> 1:00:34.750
I would die to have a job like yours.

1:00:34.750 --> 1:00:36.210
- Yeah.
- What you doing?

1:00:36.210 --> 1:00:37.830
Thinking of quitting?

1:00:37.830 --> 1:00:39.053
- Actually I have been.

1:00:41.900 --> 1:00:43.540
- What?

1:00:43.540 --> 1:00:44.690
- If you're interested,

1:00:46.540 --> 1:00:48.980
I'll hand my job over to you right now.

1:00:48.980 --> 1:00:51.590
I'll give you this rod and this bag.

1:00:51.590 --> 1:00:53.960
And I'll take you right over
to the supervisor's office.

1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:55.240
So you could check in with her.

1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:56.700
- You not jabbing me right?
- It's right over there.

1:00:56.700 --> 1:00:57.950
Nah, nah, man, nah.

1:00:57.950 --> 1:00:59.610
It's right over there
by the public restrooms.

1:00:59.610 --> 1:01:00.570
- You're not jabbing?

1:01:00.570 --> 1:01:01.750
- No.

1:01:01.750 --> 1:01:03.170
- Really?

1:01:03.170 --> 1:01:05.220
Dude, how about that vest?

1:01:05.220 --> 1:01:07.960
You gave me that vest
man, that's a deal maker.

1:01:07.960 --> 1:01:09.765
- The deal is made.

1:01:09.765 --> 1:01:10.598
- Oh man.

1:01:11.564 --> 1:01:13.110
Dude.

1:01:13.110 --> 1:01:14.720
You're kidding me.

1:01:14.720 --> 1:01:15.720
- I'm not kidding man.

1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:16.553
- Oh man.

1:01:16.553 --> 1:01:17.900
How do I look?
How do I look?

1:01:17.900 --> 1:01:19.650
- You look like a groundskeeper.

1:01:19.650 --> 1:01:23.550
Man, I have found own replacement

1:01:23.550 --> 1:01:26.580
and I didn't even leave the
supervisor high and dry.

1:01:26.580 --> 1:01:28.820
- Kelly did you received that message

1:01:28.820 --> 1:01:31.360
in regards to the event
that's coming up next week?

1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:33.210
We have to be out by 3:30.

1:01:33.210 --> 1:01:34.672
- Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.

1:01:34.672 --> 1:01:36.022
(knock on door)

1:01:36.022 --> 1:01:37.590
(gentle music)

1:01:37.590 --> 1:01:39.210
- Excuse me.

1:01:39.210 --> 1:01:41.710
- [Manager] Don't tell me,
another one quit again?

1:01:44.710 --> 1:01:45.840
- Yes ma'am,

1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:47.830
but if you give me a shot,

1:01:47.830 --> 1:01:50.130
these grounds out here will be immaculate.

1:01:50.130 --> 1:01:51.600
There'll be no trash out there

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:55.706
and I promise you you're
gon' be happy you hired me.

1:01:55.706 --> 1:01:57.406
- Are you down on your luck fella?

1:01:59.170 --> 1:02:01.883
- Truthfully, I am.

1:02:03.220 --> 1:02:04.563
Woke up under a bridge,

1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:08.760
head injury, can't remember nothing.

1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:11.046
- No family or friends to help out?

1:02:11.046 --> 1:02:11.989
(man scoffs)

1:02:11.989 --> 1:02:14.130
- I don't know if I have kids.

1:02:14.130 --> 1:02:15.660
Family, nothing.

1:02:15.660 --> 1:02:16.493
- Well, you know what?

1:02:16.493 --> 1:02:17.930
I'm gonna help you out.

1:02:17.930 --> 1:02:20.380
At least as far as a job goes.

1:02:20.380 --> 1:02:21.213
- Really?

1:02:22.098 --> 1:02:23.910
(indistinct)

1:02:23.910 --> 1:02:27.810
Ma'am, I noticed you have
a garage out back there.

1:02:27.810 --> 1:02:31.610
You think me and my dog
could possibly sleep there?

1:02:31.610 --> 1:02:33.180
Wait a minute though,

1:02:33.180 --> 1:02:36.260
just until I regain my
memory and get on my feet.

1:02:36.260 --> 1:02:37.093
I promise you.

1:02:37.093 --> 1:02:38.350
- You know what?

1:02:38.350 --> 1:02:39.460
I suppose so.

1:02:39.460 --> 1:02:42.020
As long as you take care of everything,

1:02:42.020 --> 1:02:43.360
you don't take anything.

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:45.270
Keep the place neat.

1:02:45.270 --> 1:02:46.708
Don't make a mess.

1:02:46.708 --> 1:02:47.860
- No, I promise.

1:02:47.860 --> 1:02:49.350
I promise you.

1:02:49.350 --> 1:02:50.760
We're gonna keep that place clean.

1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:52.970
You're not gonna be disappointed.

1:02:52.970 --> 1:02:54.080
- Now lemme ask you,

1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:56.520
did my ex employee,

1:02:56.520 --> 1:02:59.380
did he explain what the job entails?

1:02:59.380 --> 1:03:00.213
- Yes, ma'am.

1:03:00.213 --> 1:03:01.983
He said cleaning up stuff,

1:03:03.020 --> 1:03:04.403
cleaning up poop.

1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:08.390
Just making sure the place
is really spick and span.

1:03:08.390 --> 1:03:12.000
- Also disposing of the
trash in the dumpsters

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.380
behind the restrooms.

1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:15.768
- Wait, you said dumpster.

1:03:15.768 --> 1:03:16.601
- [Manager] Yes.

1:03:16.601 --> 1:03:18.470
- Does that dumpster have a lock on it?

1:03:18.470 --> 1:03:20.040
- Yes, why?

1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:22.290
- Has anyone ever fallen
in and gotten stuck?

1:03:23.350 --> 1:03:25.150
- Not that I have heard of.

1:03:25.150 --> 1:03:26.692
- You sure?

1:03:26.692 --> 1:03:28.372
- [Manager] Yes, nothing, no one-

1:03:28.372 --> 1:03:29.572
- All right no.

1:03:29.572 --> 1:03:31.080
No I'm good, I'm good.

1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:32.233
Just making sure.

1:03:33.270 --> 1:03:34.630
I can do this.

1:03:34.630 --> 1:03:36.300
You're not gonna be disappointed.

1:03:36.300 --> 1:03:39.110
- Now let me ask you in regards to salary,

1:03:39.110 --> 1:03:42.500
it pays $30 cash per day.

1:03:42.500 --> 1:03:44.100
Will that work out for you?

1:03:44.100 --> 1:03:45.020
- Say no further.

1:03:45.020 --> 1:03:46.320
Say no further.

1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:49.680
Is good as long as now me
and my dog are gonna eat.

1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:50.900
- Well, you know what?

1:03:50.900 --> 1:03:51.930
Welcome aboard.

1:03:51.930 --> 1:03:53.823
I'm happy to have you here.

1:03:53.823 --> 1:03:55.250
- [Man] I see you like dogs.

1:03:55.250 --> 1:03:57.530
- I do, I do, there we are.

1:03:57.530 --> 1:03:58.470
Well, welcome aboard.

1:03:58.470 --> 1:04:00.337
It's nice to have you.

1:04:00.337 --> 1:04:02.020
- Thank you so much.

1:04:02.020 --> 1:04:03.270
- I'm happy to help you out.

1:04:03.270 --> 1:04:05.138
Did I get your name?

1:04:05.138 --> 1:04:08.090
No, people call me John.

1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:10.290
- As in John Doe?

1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:15.040
- No, as in in John 3:16.

1:04:15.040 --> 1:04:16.780
- Ah for God so loved the world

1:04:16.780 --> 1:04:19.210
that he sent his one and only son.

1:04:19.210 --> 1:04:21.230
And those that shall believe in him

1:04:21.230 --> 1:04:22.726
shall not perish.

1:04:22.726 --> 1:04:24.860
- But have everlasting life.

1:04:24.860 --> 1:04:26.300
- I like it, like it a lot.

1:04:26.300 --> 1:04:27.170
Welcome.

1:04:27.170 --> 1:04:28.981
- Yup, your not gonna be disappointed.

1:04:28.981 --> 1:04:30.014
- Very good. I know, I trust you.

1:04:30.014 --> 1:04:31.136
- [Man] You are not gonna be disappointed.

1:04:31.136 --> 1:04:32.093
- I have faith in you.
- And I won't quit.

1:04:32.093 --> 1:04:33.450
I'll see you soon boss.

1:04:33.450 --> 1:04:34.396
- [Manager] Yes, sir.

1:04:34.396 --> 1:04:35.731
- All right.
- [Manager] Bye bye.

1:04:35.731 --> 1:04:38.314
(gentle music)

1:05:05.201 --> 1:05:06.628
- Ma'am, ma'am.

1:05:06.628 --> 1:05:07.540
Your phone.

1:05:07.540 --> 1:05:09.710
- Oh, thank you sir.
- Yeah no problem.

1:05:09.710 --> 1:05:12.070
- Yeah thanks, she's nothing
without her phone buddy.

1:05:12.070 --> 1:05:15.230
- Hey, thank you for
that meal the other day.

1:05:15.230 --> 1:05:16.760
That was much appreciated.

1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:18.480
- Oh man, was that you buddy?

1:05:18.480 --> 1:05:20.300
I'm so sorry.

1:05:20.300 --> 1:05:21.890
Me and my girl here, we're just,

1:05:21.890 --> 1:05:23.140
we were just having a bad day

1:05:23.140 --> 1:05:24.260
and I didn't mean to take it out on you.

1:05:24.260 --> 1:05:27.133
- Don't explain. Hey, I forgive you.

1:05:28.010 --> 1:05:28.843
God bless you.

1:05:28.843 --> 1:05:29.676
- You too buddy.

1:05:32.020 --> 1:05:34.959
Don't act so high and mighty to me.

1:05:34.959 --> 1:05:36.890
You were laughing too when I
threw that food in the trash.

1:05:36.890 --> 1:05:38.470
- Well, yeah, I laughed,

1:05:38.470 --> 1:05:41.560
but when I turned around and
saw that man in the garbage,

1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:42.763
I felt really bad.

1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:49.440
I even asked God if He would forgive us

1:05:50.330 --> 1:05:51.700
for how we treated him.

1:05:51.700 --> 1:05:52.750
I don't know, I just,

1:05:53.640 --> 1:05:55.160
I really hoped that meeting him today

1:05:55.160 --> 1:05:57.010
meant that he forgives us,

1:05:57.010 --> 1:05:59.810
and God forgives us too.

1:05:59.810 --> 1:06:01.610
- Honey I do think you may be right.

1:06:02.906 --> 1:06:05.989
(anticipatory music)

1:06:07.370 --> 1:06:10.110
- Hey, isn't that the guy we
pushed in the creek before?

1:06:10.110 --> 1:06:12.300
- What do you say we
help them get a big gulp

1:06:12.300 --> 1:06:13.210
from that creek?

1:06:13.210 --> 1:06:14.600
- That'd be funny as all out.

1:06:14.600 --> 1:06:15.976
- Let's go.

1:06:15.976 --> 1:06:17.117
(dramatic anticipatory music)

1:06:17.117 --> 1:06:19.617
(dog barking)

1:06:22.296 --> 1:06:25.379
(joyful light music)

1:06:33.996 --> 1:06:37.918
(dramatic anticipatory music)

1:06:37.918 --> 1:06:40.251
(loud thud)

1:06:43.780 --> 1:06:45.425
- [Boy] See anything?

1:06:45.425 --> 1:06:46.993
- [Boy] No. Grab the chainsaw.

1:06:48.688 --> 1:06:49.770
- Okay, let's get outta here.

1:06:49.770 --> 1:06:50.603
- Let's go.

1:06:52.957 --> 1:06:53.981
(dramatic sound effect)
- Hey,

1:06:53.981 --> 1:06:55.269
what are you guys doing?

1:06:55.269 --> 1:06:56.306
- Dang it.

1:06:56.306 --> 1:06:57.310
(heartbeat sound effect)
- Get out of our way.

1:06:57.310 --> 1:06:59.021
Or I swear I'll cut you in half.

1:06:59.021 --> 1:07:00.301
(chainsaw running)

1:07:00.301 --> 1:07:04.634
(heart beat sound effect continues)

1:07:06.009 --> 1:07:07.170
What? What?

1:07:07.170 --> 1:07:08.230
- What happened?

1:07:08.230 --> 1:07:09.140
Why'd you stop?
- I don't know,

1:07:09.140 --> 1:07:10.260
maybe it ran out of gas.

1:07:10.260 --> 1:07:15.260
- Or maybe my Lord and savior,
Jesus Christ protected me.

1:07:16.090 --> 1:07:16.923
- What?

1:07:16.923 --> 1:07:18.350
- Put it back.
- No, no.

1:07:18.350 --> 1:07:19.373
- Put it back!

1:07:20.243 --> 1:07:22.770
- Just do it brother put the saw back.

1:07:22.770 --> 1:07:23.603
- All right.

1:07:24.493 --> 1:07:25.343
I'll put it back.

1:07:27.750 --> 1:07:29.023
- When I got this job,

1:07:29.950 --> 1:07:33.200
I was made responsible for
every single tool in this place.

1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:37.510
And if one goes missing, I lose my job.

1:07:37.510 --> 1:07:41.790
So, these tools are more
important than your life?

1:07:41.790 --> 1:07:42.940
- Listen, Mr.,

1:07:42.940 --> 1:07:45.640
we learnt our lesson,
just let us leave, please.

1:07:45.640 --> 1:07:47.410
- A rusty chainsaw,

1:07:47.410 --> 1:07:49.583
that was worth taking another man's life?

1:07:49.583 --> 1:07:51.900
(boy stammering)

1:07:51.900 --> 1:07:53.930
You wanna go to jail for
the rest of your life?

1:07:53.930 --> 1:07:54.763
- [Boy] I don't.

1:07:54.763 --> 1:07:55.880
- Is that what you want?

1:07:55.880 --> 1:07:57.500
- [Boy] No sir.

1:07:57.500 --> 1:07:59.523
- Huh? Is it worth it?

1:08:00.610 --> 1:08:01.910
How much did you think you were gonna get

1:08:01.910 --> 1:08:02.873
from that chainsaw?

1:08:04.270 --> 1:08:05.423
- Maybe 20 bucks.

1:08:06.500 --> 1:08:08.210
- 20 bucks huh?

1:08:08.210 --> 1:08:09.313
- Maybe.
- Look,

1:08:12.180 --> 1:08:13.850
20 bucks.

1:08:13.850 --> 1:08:15.573
- [Boy] You gave us $20.

1:08:16.580 --> 1:08:17.860
- I just tried to kill you.

1:08:17.860 --> 1:08:21.530
- Yeah, but I'll stop you
from living this kinda life.

1:08:21.530 --> 1:08:23.230
- We could sure use the money sir.

1:08:24.396 --> 1:08:26.343
- We have a sister at home we gotta feed.

1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:28.273
- Yeah.

1:08:29.260 --> 1:08:30.310
How old are you guys?

1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:34.223
- 16.
- Yeah?

1:08:35.077 --> 1:08:37.210
You guys can get a job, right?

1:08:37.210 --> 1:08:38.520
Should be working for money.

1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:39.523
Not doing this.

1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:43.400
You wanna be away from
your mom and sister?

1:08:43.400 --> 1:08:44.960
Is that it?

1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:45.793
- No, sir.

1:08:46.740 --> 1:08:49.850
- Come down the mission tomorrow,
I know the pastor there.

1:08:49.850 --> 1:08:51.890
He'll help you guys get jobs.

1:08:51.890 --> 1:08:53.140
Earn money the right way.

1:08:55.620 --> 1:08:57.090
Yeah?
- [Boy] I can do that.

1:08:57.090 --> 1:08:58.230
- Thank you, sir.

1:08:58.230 --> 1:08:59.210
I can't repay you.

1:08:59.210 --> 1:09:00.650
- That's all right.

1:09:00.650 --> 1:09:01.483
Go.

1:09:07.700 --> 1:09:10.940
Heavenly Father, guide these boys

1:09:10.940 --> 1:09:13.870
in the way they're supposed
to go and protect them,

1:09:13.870 --> 1:09:15.190
Lord Jesus.

1:09:15.190 --> 1:09:16.023
Amen.

1:09:18.490 --> 1:09:21.180
Boy.
(man claps hands)

1:09:21.180 --> 1:09:22.883
Really? Hide in there.

1:09:25.131 --> 1:09:28.298
(bright joyful music)

1:09:32.010 --> 1:09:33.120
Father.
- Hey.

1:09:34.700 --> 1:09:36.640
- How are you doing?
- Oh good son,

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:38.340
where are you been staying my son?

1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:42.670
- You know what, I actually got a job.

1:09:42.670 --> 1:09:43.590
Can you believe that?

1:09:43.590 --> 1:09:45.120
- Oh wow.
- Working down

1:09:45.120 --> 1:09:47.780
at the city park as a maintenance worker.

1:09:47.780 --> 1:09:49.480
- Oh wow.
- Yeah, supervisor,

1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:51.833
she's letting me stay
in the adjacent garage.

1:09:52.950 --> 1:09:54.721
Things are looking up.

1:09:54.721 --> 1:09:57.870
If I can get this memory
right, think I'll be good.

1:09:57.870 --> 1:09:59.750
- Well, you know, you're
always welcome here.

1:09:59.750 --> 1:10:01.650
You do know that?

1:10:01.650 --> 1:10:02.907
- Yeah, I know that.

1:10:02.907 --> 1:10:06.910
And I appreciate that, but
I ain't gonna take a cot,

1:10:06.910 --> 1:10:09.801
from someone out there
that needs it more than me.

1:10:09.801 --> 1:10:12.973
- Well, I do appreciate you
stopping in now and again.

1:10:13.940 --> 1:10:14.773
- Yeah.

1:10:15.913 --> 1:10:17.407
I gotta tell you something though,

1:10:17.407 --> 1:10:22.220
I invited a couple of teens up
to no good down at the park,

1:10:22.220 --> 1:10:26.160
but invited them down, maybe
we can help them find a job.

1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:26.993
What do you say?

1:10:26.993 --> 1:10:28.680
- Sure, sure. Be glad to.

1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:29.690
- Thank you. Thank you.

1:10:29.690 --> 1:10:31.870
I can always depend on you.

1:10:31.870 --> 1:10:33.370
Thank you.
- Appreciate that.

1:10:33.370 --> 1:10:34.643
- Speaking of the devil,

1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:39.253
or should I say, ex devils, right boys?

1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:43.440
- Well, gentlemen, take a seat.

1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:45.470
- These are the young men
I was telling you about.

1:10:45.470 --> 1:10:46.361
- Oh, okay.

1:10:46.361 --> 1:10:48.691
- I hope we ain't delaying your servicing.

1:10:48.691 --> 1:10:50.340
- No the service can wait,

1:10:50.340 --> 1:10:53.313
the Lord has more pressing
work for me to do now.

1:10:56.800 --> 1:10:59.400
- Mom was, she was really grateful

1:10:59.400 --> 1:11:01.811
for the money you gave us last night.

1:11:01.811 --> 1:11:03.111
We really appreciate that.

1:11:04.595 --> 1:11:05.795
- I'm glad I could help.

1:11:07.295 --> 1:11:10.550
- You boys in school?

1:11:10.550 --> 1:11:12.640
- Not right now because of summer break.

1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:14.540
But this fall I'll be a sophomore

1:11:14.540 --> 1:11:17.070
and my brother here, will be a junior.

1:11:17.070 --> 1:11:18.523
- Hmm. Well that's great.

1:11:19.390 --> 1:11:22.410
So as far as working hours,

1:11:22.410 --> 1:11:26.413
you're pretty flexible
until school starts back up?

1:11:27.730 --> 1:11:30.270
- I don't think that'll matter much.

1:11:30.270 --> 1:11:32.310
- Why do you say that?

1:11:32.310 --> 1:11:36.490
- Because we don't think people
would want people like us

1:11:36.490 --> 1:11:37.907
working for them.

1:11:38.950 --> 1:11:40.053
- Nobody wants us.

1:11:41.030 --> 1:11:43.590
Not even our father wants
anything to do with us.

1:11:43.590 --> 1:11:45.500
- Listen, you can't concern yourself

1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:46.970
with what others think.

1:11:46.970 --> 1:11:49.220
- Before he left us,

1:11:49.220 --> 1:11:50.740
our dad said it was all worthless

1:11:50.740 --> 1:11:52.506
and didn't wanna see us no more.

1:11:52.506 --> 1:11:56.643
- Look, look, you don't say
that about yourself, all right.

1:11:56.643 --> 1:11:58.190
Look at me.

1:11:58.190 --> 1:11:59.973
I'm all covered in tattoos.

1:12:01.090 --> 1:12:02.610
You don't think I get judged?

1:12:02.610 --> 1:12:05.760
You don't think people out there judge me.

1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:06.840
I have to prove.

1:12:06.840 --> 1:12:09.350
I've been trying to prove
the last couple of days

1:12:09.350 --> 1:12:11.313
that I ain't that person that they see.

1:12:12.970 --> 1:12:16.460
- You both are good in
the eyes of the Lord.

1:12:16.460 --> 1:12:19.810
- Oh, I don't know why
anyone would wanna hire

1:12:19.810 --> 1:12:21.717
a couple of dummies like us.

1:12:21.717 --> 1:12:22.550
(man sighs)

1:12:22.550 --> 1:12:25.253
- Don't say, do you think
your brother's dumb?

1:12:26.370 --> 1:12:27.916
- [Man] Look at him.

1:12:27.916 --> 1:12:28.780
Is he dumb?

1:12:28.780 --> 1:12:29.613
- No.

1:12:29.613 --> 1:12:30.640
- [Man] Is he dumb?

1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:31.473
- Of course not.

1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:33.593
- Then?

1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:38.423
- Yeah, but other people
don't see it that way.

1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:40.880
Even the teachers in school say that

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:44.030
they're just pushing us
along from grade to grade.

1:12:44.030 --> 1:12:45.850
Just to get rid of us.

1:12:45.850 --> 1:12:47.973
- Don't worry about what others think.

1:12:47.973 --> 1:12:50.800
What you guys need to
concern yourself with

1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:53.850
is proving 'em wrong, right?

1:12:53.850 --> 1:12:55.350
Prove 'em wrong.

1:12:55.350 --> 1:12:57.880
Your mother, she needs you, right?

1:12:57.880 --> 1:13:00.480
I think she needs you more
than what you guys think.

1:13:01.370 --> 1:13:03.320
Right?
- That's why we decided

1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:05.470
to come here if you helped us out.

1:13:05.470 --> 1:13:06.303
- Exactly.

1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:09.670
I'm happy you did, man.

1:13:13.570 --> 1:13:16.343
- I'm so sorry for trying
to hurt you last night.

1:13:16.343 --> 1:13:17.963
I'm so sorry.

1:13:19.330 --> 1:13:20.753
I wish I was dead.

1:13:20.753 --> 1:13:24.203
- Hey nah, nah, nah you don't say that.

1:13:26.355 --> 1:13:27.820
- [Pastor] Yeah, don't say that.

1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:30.563
- Look at me. I forgive you.

1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:33.720
All right?

1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:36.613
Worry about being an example to him.

1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:41.000
Can we be excused for a moment?

1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:42.030
- Yeah, sure.

1:13:42.030 --> 1:13:44.833
Go ahead and have a seat in the chapel.

1:13:46.700 --> 1:13:48.370
- [Man] Okay, don't go anywhere right?

1:13:48.370 --> 1:13:49.270
We'll be right up.

1:13:52.781 --> 1:13:55.997
- You know, I don't know
what happened last night

1:13:55.997 --> 1:13:58.883
and I don't know if I wanna know.

1:13:59.750 --> 1:14:00.623
- Nah, you don't.

1:14:03.270 --> 1:14:04.103
But God,

1:14:06.230 --> 1:14:08.670
he works in mysterious ways.

1:14:08.670 --> 1:14:09.853
- You right about that.

1:14:10.890 --> 1:14:12.053
He sure does.

1:14:14.660 --> 1:14:16.600
Well, good morning, everyone.

1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:18.570
I'm really glad to see everybody here.

1:14:18.570 --> 1:14:20.880
Do you wanna hear about Jesus today?

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:24.980
Even though he had done many
good deeds and how many people,

1:14:24.980 --> 1:14:28.850
Jesus wasn't originally
regarded as the son of God.

1:14:28.850 --> 1:14:32.120
His fellow Jews ignored his righteous acts

1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:35.180
and tried to use his words against him.

1:14:35.180 --> 1:14:38.640
While attending the
celebration inside the temple,

1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:43.640
other Jews demanded that he
declare himself the son of God.

1:14:44.540 --> 1:14:49.470
Jesus answered, "The works that
I do, bear witness about me.

1:14:49.470 --> 1:14:53.770
But you do not believe because
you are not among my sheep.

1:14:53.770 --> 1:14:58.770
My sheep hear my voice and I
know them and they follow me.

1:14:58.860 --> 1:15:03.150
I give them eternal life
and they will never perish.

1:15:03.150 --> 1:15:08.150
And no one will snatch them from my hand.

1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:13.100
My father gave me the sheep
and no one is greater than Him.

1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:15.240
He and I are one."

1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:17.590
When Jesus left the temple,

1:15:17.590 --> 1:15:20.240
his detractors followed him outside.

1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:22.980
They had taken issue with Jesus' comment

1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:25.570
that he and the father are one.

1:15:25.570 --> 1:15:27.410
They began to collect rocks

1:15:27.410 --> 1:15:30.753
with the intention to
stone Jesus to death.

1:15:32.010 --> 1:15:35.697
Jesus faced the angry mob, and said,

1:15:35.697 --> 1:15:39.930
"I have done many good works,
for which do you stone me?"

1:15:39.930 --> 1:15:42.680
The men answered, "It's
not for your good works,

1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:45.340
it's because you called yourself God."

1:15:45.340 --> 1:15:47.087
Jesus replied,

1:15:47.087 --> 1:15:50.420
"Are you saying that I'm blaspheming

1:15:50.420 --> 1:15:53.830
because I said I was the son of God?

1:15:53.830 --> 1:15:58.830
The father is in me and
I am in the Father."

1:15:59.070 --> 1:16:00.890
The angry men realized

1:16:00.890 --> 1:16:03.800
no one wanted to cast the first stone.

1:16:03.800 --> 1:16:07.173
So they dropped their
rocks and left Jesus alone.

1:16:08.350 --> 1:16:11.013
That story is from John 10.

1:16:13.110 --> 1:16:15.863
Jesus had more to say in this chapter,

1:16:16.950 --> 1:16:19.847
which I would like to read for you now.

1:16:19.847 --> 1:16:22.610
"Truly, truly I say unto you,

1:16:22.610 --> 1:16:25.770
he who does not enter the
sheepfold by the door,

1:16:25.770 --> 1:16:27.650
but comes in another way,

1:16:27.650 --> 1:16:30.820
that man is a thief and a robber.

1:16:30.820 --> 1:16:35.410
But he who enters by the door
is the shepherd of the sheep.

1:16:35.410 --> 1:16:38.413
To him, the gatekeeper opens.

1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:41.260
The sheep hear his voice,

1:16:41.260 --> 1:16:44.897
and he calls them by name,
and he leads them out."

1:16:45.760 --> 1:16:49.370
Jesus said, "I am the door for the sheep.

1:16:49.370 --> 1:16:53.560
If anybody enters by me, he will be saved,

1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:54.963
and find pasture.

1:16:55.960 --> 1:17:00.570
The thief comes only to steal
and to kill, and destroy.

1:17:01.910 --> 1:17:05.950
I came that they may have
life and have it abundantly.

1:17:05.950 --> 1:17:08.090
I am the good shepherd

1:17:08.090 --> 1:17:12.940
and the good shepherd lays
down his life for his sheep.

1:17:12.940 --> 1:17:16.710
No one takes it from me, but I
lay it down of my own accord.

1:17:16.710 --> 1:17:18.660
I have authority to lay it down

1:17:18.660 --> 1:17:21.423
and I have authority to take it up again.

1:17:22.360 --> 1:17:26.300
This charge I have
received from my father."

1:17:26.300 --> 1:17:27.562
Amen.

1:17:27.562 --> 1:17:29.979
(soft music)

1:17:44.582 --> 1:17:47.332
(dramatic music)

1:17:48.543 --> 1:17:50.480
- Aye, you dropped something.

1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:51.838
(woman screams)
(indistinct)

1:17:51.838 --> 1:17:54.338
(dog barking)

1:17:57.313 --> 1:17:58.396
- I know you.

1:18:02.964 --> 1:18:03.797
Hey?

1:18:03.797 --> 1:18:05.740
Yeah. You took my whole life from me.

1:18:05.740 --> 1:18:06.573
- How do you know me?

1:18:06.573 --> 1:18:07.940
You don't know me.
- You took my whole life.

1:18:07.940 --> 1:18:09.440
- What are you talking about, man?

1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:11.400
- You robbed me. You hit me in the head.

1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:12.369
Hey, what do you want?

1:18:12.369 --> 1:18:13.603
(loud thud)

1:18:13.603 --> 1:18:15.063
- Come on guys, let's go.

1:18:16.798 --> 1:18:17.680
(man shouting)

1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:18.720
- [Man] Where's my ID?

1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:19.977
- We just took the cash.

1:18:19.977 --> 1:18:22.838
- And what street? What
street this happen on?

1:18:22.838 --> 1:18:24.350
(dog barking in the background)

1:18:24.350 --> 1:18:25.510
- Fifth street, yeah, yeah, by the market.

1:18:25.510 --> 1:18:28.050
- My car? What kinda car was I driving?

1:18:28.050 --> 1:18:30.093
- It was a red "Kia," I think.

1:18:30.093 --> 1:18:30.926
- [Man] Think!

1:18:30.926 --> 1:18:32.140
- It was dark, it was
really dark, I think.

1:18:32.140 --> 1:18:33.926
It was a red "Kia" man.

1:18:33.926 --> 1:18:35.253
(man crying)

1:18:35.253 --> 1:18:36.813
- Get outta here.
(dog barking)

1:18:36.813 --> 1:18:38.246
Go!

1:18:38.246 --> 1:18:39.079
Go!

1:18:40.214 --> 1:18:43.547
(dramatic sound effect)

1:18:47.212 --> 1:18:49.167
(soft music)

1:18:49.167 --> 1:18:50.450
Here's your purse ma'am.

1:18:50.450 --> 1:18:52.110
- Thank you kind sir.

1:18:52.110 --> 1:18:54.583
Wish there were more nice
men like you out there.

1:18:55.990 --> 1:18:57.420
Can I ever repay you?

1:18:57.420 --> 1:18:58.803
Do you need some cash?

1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:02.726
- You know when I really need your help?

1:19:02.726 --> 1:19:05.037
Was the bus stop.

1:19:05.037 --> 1:19:06.677
- The bus stop?

1:19:06.677 --> 1:19:07.986
He grabbed ahold of my arm officer,

1:19:07.986 --> 1:19:09.544
and he wouldn't let me go.

1:19:09.544 --> 1:19:11.961
(soft music)

1:19:29.770 --> 1:19:30.670
- Excuse me ma'am.

1:19:31.773 --> 1:19:35.050
There was a car that was broken
down on your parking lot.

1:19:35.050 --> 1:19:36.110
Probably got towed.

1:19:36.110 --> 1:19:39.147
Do you happen to know where
that tow truck took it?

1:19:39.147 --> 1:19:41.510
- Can you tell me why you abandoned it?

1:19:41.510 --> 1:19:44.430
- I didn't abandon my car,
ma'am, I wouldn't do that.

1:19:44.430 --> 1:19:48.000
I was changing out the
tire and a group of thugs

1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.020
attacked me, hit me with a tire iron.

1:19:50.020 --> 1:19:51.550
I barely even remember my own name.

1:19:51.550 --> 1:19:54.030
- Guess that explains all the blood.

1:19:54.030 --> 1:19:55.270
- Yes ma'am.

1:19:55.270 --> 1:19:57.000
Obviously though,

1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.747
thank God I was able
to walk away from that.

1:20:00.770 --> 1:20:02.520
But like I said, I don't remember nothing.

1:20:02.520 --> 1:20:03.980
I need to find my car.

1:20:03.980 --> 1:20:05.940
Maybe it has a clue to where I live.

1:20:05.940 --> 1:20:07.070
Who I am.
- I want you to know,

1:20:07.070 --> 1:20:09.840
that I did wait a while to
call the towing company.

1:20:09.840 --> 1:20:11.490
I was waiting for the owner to return.

1:20:11.490 --> 1:20:12.880
- And I appreciate that.

1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:13.713
I do appreciate that.

1:20:13.713 --> 1:20:15.647
- And you were in a no parking zone.

1:20:15.647 --> 1:20:16.977
- I did not know that,

1:20:16.977 --> 1:20:18.460
and I'm not questioning why you called

1:20:18.460 --> 1:20:19.860
the tow truck company ma'am.

1:20:20.830 --> 1:20:23.380
- Then why are you here? I doubt
it's for the fresh produce.

1:20:23.380 --> 1:20:26.840
- No, ma'am like I said, I
just need to find my car,

1:20:26.840 --> 1:20:29.590
I need to find those clues,
so I can find out who I am.

1:20:30.720 --> 1:20:31.553
Tow truck?

1:20:32.410 --> 1:20:35.767
- Towing company. "Monroe Towing."

1:20:35.767 --> 1:20:36.667
- "Monroe Towing".

1:20:38.068 --> 1:20:39.397
Oh thank you. Thank you.

1:20:39.397 --> 1:20:40.230
"Monroe Towing."

1:20:41.148 --> 1:20:43.700
Do you know where "Monroe Towing," is?

1:20:43.700 --> 1:20:45.240
- A couple of blocks up fifth,

1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:46.923
turn left on Monroe Avenue.

1:20:47.890 --> 1:20:49.320
- Fifth Avenue, Monroe Avenue.

1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:50.270
- It's called "Monroe Towing,"

1:20:50.270 --> 1:20:52.440
it's located on Monroe Avenue.

1:20:52.440 --> 1:20:53.343
- Obviously right.

1:20:54.217 --> 1:20:56.767
I thank you, and I know
this is gonna sound stupid.

1:20:57.840 --> 1:20:59.559
You might even get mad at me,

1:20:59.559 --> 1:21:01.810
but do you happen to know the make model

1:21:01.810 --> 1:21:02.913
and color of my car?

1:21:03.879 --> 1:21:06.767
- You don't know the make
and model of your own car?

1:21:06.767 --> 1:21:08.340
- Like I said I got hit in the head.

1:21:08.340 --> 1:21:10.297
I don't even know my own name.

1:21:10.297 --> 1:21:11.538
- Didn't think it was that bad.

1:21:11.538 --> 1:21:13.187
- Yeah it was pretty bad.

1:21:13.187 --> 1:21:15.287
- It was a red "Kia".

1:21:15.287 --> 1:21:18.157
- Red "Kia." I own a red "Kia"?

1:21:19.028 --> 1:21:22.136
- I'm not judging.
- Thank you for your help.

1:21:22.136 --> 1:21:23.880
- Why don't you take some
apples for your trip?

1:21:23.880 --> 1:21:25.510
- Can I get one for my dog?

1:21:25.510 --> 1:21:28.388
- Of course.
You're welcome.

1:21:28.388 --> 1:21:30.308
- God bless you, okay.

1:21:30.308 --> 1:21:31.198
Monroe Avenue, right?

1:21:31.198 --> 1:21:32.167
- Monroe Avenue.

1:21:32.167 --> 1:21:33.000
- [Man] Monroe Avenue.

1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:34.027
Thank you so much.

1:21:34.027 --> 1:21:34.890
- You're welcome.
- [Man] All right.

1:21:34.890 --> 1:21:36.640
Thank you. Thank you.

1:21:38.580 --> 1:21:40.997
(soft music)

1:21:48.569 --> 1:21:51.660
Stay. I got something to do.

1:21:51.660 --> 1:21:53.140
Stay!

1:21:53.140 --> 1:21:54.380
Stay!

1:21:54.380 --> 1:21:55.213
Sit.

1:21:59.560 --> 1:22:01.610
- Hey, can you go down
on eighth and Jefferson

1:22:01.610 --> 1:22:03.160
and take care of this lady on a tow?

1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:04.602
- Yeah. You know where
you wan' me to take it?

1:22:04.602 --> 1:22:06.200
You wanna take an impound or what?

1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:07.600
- Let's just bring it here

1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:09.833
but right now, take your
lunch before you go do that

1:22:09.833 --> 1:22:11.340
It'll be 'bout an hour or
so if you get down here.

1:22:11.340 --> 1:22:12.950
- [Man] All right then.
- [Man] Can I help you?

1:22:12.950 --> 1:22:13.783
- Yeah.

1:22:15.210 --> 1:22:17.340
Was there a car, a red "Kia,"

1:22:17.340 --> 1:22:20.320
that was towed from that little
market down there on fifth?

1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:21.600
- Yeah, we got that here.

1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:23.374
- All right. Thank you.

1:22:23.374 --> 1:22:24.207
Thank you.

1:22:24.207 --> 1:22:25.890
I need to get into that car.

1:22:25.890 --> 1:22:28.110
I need to get into that car.

1:22:28.110 --> 1:22:29.850
- You got any money?

1:22:29.850 --> 1:22:31.770
- I don't have money on me, no.

1:22:31.770 --> 1:22:32.637
- What's your name?

1:22:32.637 --> 1:22:33.700
- That's the problem?

1:22:33.700 --> 1:22:35.280
I don't know my name.

1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:36.780
- What? Wait a minute, hold on.

1:22:36.780 --> 1:22:37.770
You got no money.

1:22:37.770 --> 1:22:38.990
You don't know your name

1:22:38.990 --> 1:22:40.960
and you want me to
release a vehicle to you?

1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:42.080
Look, buddy.

1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:43.700
No money, no car.

1:22:43.700 --> 1:22:44.860
That's just the way it works around.

1:22:44.860 --> 1:22:46.320
That's the rules here, buddy.

1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:49.050
- If you knew my story, if you just,

1:22:49.050 --> 1:22:52.970
just hear me out, just
hear me out man, okay?

1:22:52.970 --> 1:22:54.070
- Look. All right, all right.
- You would understand.

1:22:54.070 --> 1:22:55.550
- Keep it short. I ain't got all day here.

1:22:55.550 --> 1:22:56.383
- All right.

1:22:56.383 --> 1:22:58.600
- I was down at that little market,

1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:00.540
had a flat tire, changing out the tires,

1:23:00.540 --> 1:23:03.080
some thugs hit me in the head.

1:23:03.080 --> 1:23:04.660
That's why I don't know my name.

1:23:04.660 --> 1:23:06.220
I've been wandering the streets.

1:23:06.220 --> 1:23:08.550
- Look man, I thought I
told you to keep it short.

1:23:08.550 --> 1:23:09.540
I ain't got all day here.

1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:11.240
I got work to do.
- You're not listening!

1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:13.820
You're not listening, all right?

1:23:13.820 --> 1:23:14.980
- Listen, buddy, I ain't got time-

1:23:14.980 --> 1:23:16.310
- This is my life.

1:23:16.310 --> 1:23:18.770
- Hey, no money, no car, no exceptions.

1:23:18.770 --> 1:23:19.603
You got it?

1:23:19.603 --> 1:23:21.890
Now, if you don't mind, kindly
see yourself out of here.

1:23:21.890 --> 1:23:23.500
I got work to do. Okay.

1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:24.430
I'm busy here.

1:23:24.430 --> 1:23:26.060
- You just can't give me the VIN?

1:23:26.060 --> 1:23:27.760
- No, I can't give you the VIN.

1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:29.910
Look, buddy, you want
me to get into the DMV,

1:23:29.910 --> 1:23:32.520
and get personal
information off the database

1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:33.700
and give you your car.

1:23:33.700 --> 1:23:36.840
Look, no money, no car, no exceptions.

1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:38.770
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm kinda busy today.

1:23:38.770 --> 1:23:40.860
Kindly see yourself out.

1:23:40.860 --> 1:23:42.370
All right?

1:23:42.370 --> 1:23:43.870
Before I call the cops on you.

1:23:45.130 --> 1:23:46.710
- Yeah, thanks for being nice.

1:23:46.710 --> 1:23:48.250
- Yeah, hopefully the cops come here,

1:23:48.250 --> 1:23:50.050
throw you in jail, where you belong.

1:23:52.978 --> 1:23:54.620
Can you believe that?

1:23:54.620 --> 1:23:57.668
Hey, before you go do that tow,

1:23:57.668 --> 1:23:58.896
before we take your lunch,

1:23:58.896 --> 1:24:00.420
you mind search around the building,

1:24:00.420 --> 1:24:01.800
make sure that guy's gone.

1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:03.405
- Good idea boss.

1:24:03.405 --> 1:24:05.822
(soft music)

1:24:17.225 --> 1:24:19.725
(dog barking)

1:24:22.660 --> 1:24:24.540
- Hey, he told you to get outta here,

1:24:24.540 --> 1:24:25.840
now, go!

1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:28.333
Get.
(dog barking)

1:24:31.384 --> 1:24:33.801
(soft music)

1:24:39.220 --> 1:24:40.738
- Are you Marvin?

1:24:40.738 --> 1:24:43.155
(soft music)

1:24:50.199 --> 1:24:54.456
Is this your home? Huh?

1:24:54.456 --> 1:24:56.028
Is this your home?

1:24:56.028 --> 1:24:58.445
(soft music)

1:25:07.215 --> 1:25:09.632
(man crying)

1:25:11.937 --> 1:25:12.770
Love you.

1:25:14.108 --> 1:25:15.207
I love you.

1:25:15.207 --> 1:25:17.957
(soft sad music)

1:25:32.134 --> 1:25:34.322
You better be a good.

1:25:34.322 --> 1:25:35.370
You better be good, okay?

1:25:35.370 --> 1:25:37.052
You better be a good boy.

1:25:37.052 --> 1:25:40.635
(soft sad music continues)

1:25:54.880 --> 1:25:57.880
(door bell ringing)

1:26:14.882 --> 1:26:17.715
- Mama. Marvin brought daddy home!

1:26:19.691 --> 1:26:21.502
I remember.
(girl crying)

1:26:21.502 --> 1:26:23.162
I remember.

1:26:23.162 --> 1:26:27.442
I remember who I am.
(man crying)

1:26:27.442 --> 1:26:28.359
I remember.

1:26:29.351 --> 1:26:30.268
I remember.

1:26:31.713 --> 1:26:33.223
I remember.
