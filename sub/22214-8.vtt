And then we're gonna go.
I'm not going anywhere.

33:47.901 --> 33:48.948
Just leave me alone.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.283
It wasn't your fault.

33:55.492 --> 33:56.618
Or hers.

33:57.994 --> 34:00.122
It was mine.
All of it.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.172
So don't blame her
or yourself.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.259
You can blame me.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.928
You know, you talk about
yourself a lot.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.775
And you're not allowed
to wear shoes here.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.085
I'm not gonna trip
when I put them back on.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.288
We'll see.

34:56.386 --> 34:59.185
Did you know I could be
President of the United States?

35:00.974 --> 35:04.103
Yeah?
My sister couldn't be.

35:05.437 --> 35:06.734
She wasn't born here.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.862
My mom and dad
couldn't, either.

35:12.193 --> 35:15.288
I'm the only person in my
family who could be President.

35:16.531 --> 35:17.623
Isn't that cool?

35:22.120 --> 35:23.372
If I were President...

35:26.458 --> 35:28.085
I would be able
to stay here.

35:28.835 --> 35:30.382
In the house we live in.

35:33.715 --> 35:36.138
I would find a way
to bring back my sister.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.138
I'd put the real
bad guys in jail.

35:42.015 --> 35:45.315
And... And I'd make everyone
eat Pop Tarts for dinner.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.105
And then make everyone
be nice to me.

35:52.192 --> 35:53.660
So you'd be a dictator.

35:56.196 --> 35:57.288
What's a dictator?

35:59.949 --> 36:01.917
It's like a really
bad President.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.418
Can you be President?
Probably not.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.760
So you're like my sister?
You weren't born here?

36:09.959 --> 36:11.176
No, I was.

36:12.712 --> 36:15.135
Where?
New Jersey.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.810
Really? Me too.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.687
What part?
Washington Township.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.858
Where were you born?
Trenton.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.124
Looks like your parents
still aren't home.

to the movies.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.276

Thanks, Elliot.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.752
Sorry I made you late.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.626
Hope you can still
do your important thing.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.421
Hey, Elliot?

37:38.673 --> 37:39.970
Can I see you again?

37:47.974 --> 37:49.021
Yeah.

37:49.142 --> 37:52.316
Before you go, I'll take
you to see The Martian-

37:54.856 --> 37:57.325

movies on the big screen.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.244
Yeah.
Thanks, Elliot.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.877
I think you'll like it.
Matt Damon is awesome.

do you want?

39:26.030 --> 39:27.782
You're gonna have a funeral
for your brother.

39:28.783 --> 39:31.127
A proper one.
Okay, dipshit.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.750
We're not having a funeral
for that waste of space.

39:33.830 --> 39:35.548
Your problem is
you never knew him.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.842
If you did, you'd know
he's not capable of that.

39:37.917 --> 39:41.012
Get the fuck off my property
before I call the cops.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.260
I'll go. But before I do,

39:43.423 --> 39:45.801
you should probably change
your corporate email password.

39:46.926 --> 39:50.146
Using your street address, even if
it's an old one, isn't the smartest.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.433
Don't feel special.
I hack everyone.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.981
From the emails I found,
you and your law firm

39:56.060 --> 39:59.485
swapped some shady memos that I don't
think the IRS would look too kindly on.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.654
What do you think
you found?

40:02.901 --> 40:04.278
If you don't want me
sending them out,

40:04.485 --> 40:06.203
make sure your brother
gets a funeral.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.079
A good one.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.167
I want an invite.

40:13.620 --> 40:15.167
I'll make sure
you get my email.

I was talking about.

40:26.007 --> 40:27.554
I won't be needing
them anymore.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.473
The money you make
selling them back to him

40:29.552 --> 40:31.099
will more than pay
for a funeral.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.394
Start writing a eulogy.

40:35.850 --> 40:36.897
A good one.

I'm worried about you.

I wish I could say something
that could snap you out of this.

42:22.957 --> 42:25.051
(MUSIC PLAYING)

42:32.258 --> 42:34.932
Remember when we used to do
our wishing game?

42:36.846 --> 42:41.101
We'd close our eyes,
and we'd wish for something.

42:43.519 --> 42:44.816
Whatever we wanted.

42:53.488 --> 42:56.788
We both wished we could
get bigger bedrooms.

42:58.451 --> 42:59.577
That was a big one.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.669
You would always wish
for more protractors,

43:03.831 --> 43:04.957
which was weird.

43:06.167 --> 43:09.296
I would wish
for a faster computer.

43:09.378 --> 43:12.131
Probably faster modem too.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.433
You would wish
for better clothes.

43:17.512 --> 43:20.561
I didn't really care
about that.

43:20.807 --> 43:21.854
We both...

43:23.017 --> 43:24.610
we both wished
we could drive.

43:27.105 --> 43:28.698
I just wanted to drive away.

43:30.942 --> 43:33.115
We wanted to go
on road trips.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.491
And eat lots
of Sour Patch Kids

43:38.032 --> 43:40.535
that we would buy
from gas stations.

43:42.370 --> 43:44.247
After we made
all our wishes...

43:46.707 --> 43:48.880
We'd close our eyes
really hard,

43:50.336 --> 43:52.213
hoping that when
we opened them,

43:52.380 --> 43:53.723
it'd all come true.

43:55.716 --> 43:57.810
And we thought the harder
we closed them,

43:59.303 --> 44:01.180
the stronger our wishes
would be.

44:05.393 --> 44:06.736
And even though
they never came true,

44:06.811 --> 44:08.233
we still liked doing it.

44:10.106 --> 44:12.529
Because the ending was never
our favorite part, anyway.

44:14.819 --> 44:15.866
It was the wishing.

44:20.241 --> 44:21.584
I didn't get that at first.

44:23.369 --> 44:25.542
You remember
what you used to say to me

44:26.330 --> 44:28.128
right before we opened
our eyes...

44:29.917 --> 44:31.419
