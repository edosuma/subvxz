WEBVTT

00:21.648 --> 00:25.151
<i>The sun 'll come out tomorrow</i>

00:25.318 --> 00:29.864
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

00:30.031 --> 00:32.867
There 'll be sun

00:33.034 --> 00:37.247
Just thinking about tomorrow

00:39.207 --> 00:41.501
Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow

00:41.668 --> 00:44.212
Till there's none

00:44.379 --> 00:49.884
When I'm stuck with a day
That's gray and lonely

00:50.051 --> 00:52.137
I just stick out my chin

00:52.303 --> 00:57.100
And grin and say

00:57.267 --> 01:02.939
Oh, the sun 'II come out tomorrow

01:03.106 --> 01:07.485
<i>So you gotta hang on till tomorrow</i>

01:07.652 --> 01:11.072
Come what may

01:11.239 --> 01:14.117
Tomorrow, tomorrow

01:14.284 --> 01:16.953
I love ya, tomorrow

01:17.120 --> 01:21.708
You're only a day away

01:21.875 --> 01:25.962
Tomorrow, tomorrow

01:26.129 --> 01:29.007
I love ya, tomorrow

01:29.174 --> 01:33.887
You're only a day

01:34.053 --> 01:38.975
A Way

02:22.519 --> 02:26.314
Maybe far away

02:26.481 --> 02:31.444
Or maybe real nearby

02:31.611 --> 02:35.865
He may be pouring her coffee

02:36.032 --> 02:40.703
She may be straightening his tie

02:40.870 --> 02:44.290
Maybe in a house

02:44.457 --> 02:49.087
All hidden by a hill

02:49.254 --> 02:53.591
She's sitting playing piano

02:53.758 --> 02:57.262
<i>He's sitting paying</i> a <i>bill</i>

02:57.846 --> 03:01.599
Betcha they're young
Betcha they're smart

03:01.766 --> 03:05.395
Bet they collect things
Like ashtrays and art

03:05.562 --> 03:10.316
Betcha they're good
Why shouldn't they be?

03:10.483 --> 03:16.406
Their one mistake was giving up me

03:18.491 --> 03:23.288
So maybe now it's time

03:23.454 --> 03:28.084
And maybe when I wake

03:28.251 --> 03:33.006
<i>They'll be there calling me baby</i>

03:33.172 --> 03:38.052
Maybe

03:59.824 --> 04:01.659
Annie!

04:02.452 --> 04:03.828
Annie!

04:15.214 --> 04:19.427
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.471
There, there.

04:22.263 --> 04:25.600
It was only a dream, Molly.
It's all right.

04:25.850 --> 04:28.269
How am I supposed to get any sleep?

04:28.519 --> 04:32.106
It was only a dream.
Everything's all right.

04:32.357 --> 04:34.817
Molly shouldn't be in this room.

04:35.193 --> 04:39.322
She's a baby.
She cries all the time.

04:39.572 --> 04:41.074
She wets the bed.

04:41.699 --> 04:42.992
I do not!

04:43.242 --> 04:45.870
You're the one who shouldn't
be in here!

04:46.079 --> 04:49.415
- Brat, stop!
- We're gonna get in trouble.

04:49.666 --> 04:50.875
Go, Duffy! Go!

04:51.125 --> 04:54.420
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

04:55.129 --> 04:56.923
Cut it out!

04:57.507 --> 05:01.302
I mean it! Do you want
Miss Hannigan to come in?

05:01.552 --> 05:04.013
Go back to bed.

05:06.265 --> 05:10.895
Now. Or you'll have me to deal with.

05:11.104 --> 05:14.065
Blow it out of your old Wazoo.

05:21.948 --> 05:24.867
Close your eyes.
Think about your folks.

05:25.076 --> 05:29.372
You're the only one who has folks.
Mine are dead.

05:29.706 --> 05:31.874
Think of folks
who want to adopt you...

05:32.125 --> 05:36.337
...because they want a little girl with
brown hair and brown eyes.

05:38.339 --> 05:42.093
Betcha he reads
Betcha she sews

05:42.301 --> 05:45.763
Maybe she's made me
A closet of clothes

05:46.556 --> 05:48.099
Maybe they're strict

05:48.266 --> 05:51.144
As straight as a line

05:51.310 --> 05:57.984
Don't really care
As long as they're mine

05:58.151 --> 05:59.944
Oh, my goodness.

06:00.153 --> 06:04.949
So maybe now this prayer's

06:05.116 --> 06:09.537
The last one of its kind

06:09.704 --> 06:14.625
Won't you please
Come get your baby?

06:35.980 --> 06:39.734
Did I hear singing in here?

06:46.908 --> 06:49.744
All right. Fine.

06:50.995 --> 06:53.498
Since we're all so wide awake!

06:53.706 --> 06:55.291
Get up! Get out of bed!

06:56.834 --> 07:00.505
Clean up this mess!
Get dressed!

07:00.755 --> 07:05.343
This room had better be regulation
before breakfast...

07:05.593 --> 07:09.680
...my little pig droppings.
Or kill, kill, kill!

07:09.931 --> 07:14.560
- It's in the middle of the night.
-"It's in the middle of the night."

07:15.394 --> 07:20.441
If this floor don't shine like
the top of the Chrysler Building...

07:20.691 --> 07:23.361
...your backsides will.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.612
Understand?

07:24.862 --> 07:28.116
Yes, Miss Hannigan.

07:29.659 --> 07:33.663
- What do we say, Annie?
- I love you, Miss Hannigan.

07:34.956 --> 07:38.751
Why any kid would want to be
an orphan is beyond me.

07:55.101 --> 08:00.565
It's the hard-knock life for us

08:00.731 --> 08:03.192
Instead of treated
We get tricked

08:03.359 --> 08:06.195
Instead of kisses
We get kicked

08:06.362 --> 08:08.865
It's the hard-knock life

08:24.839 --> 08:27.633
Got no folks to speak of

08:27.800 --> 08:30.469
So it's the hard-knock row we hoe

08:30.636 --> 08:33.306
Cotton blankets instead of wool

08:33.472 --> 08:36.100
Empty bellies instead of full

08:36.267 --> 08:38.394
It's the hard-knock life

08:52.533 --> 08:55.661
Don't it feel like the wind
Is always howling?

08:55.828 --> 08:58.539
Don't it seem like
There's never any light?

08:58.706 --> 09:01.542
Once a day, don't you want
To throw the towel in?

09:01.709 --> 09:04.921
It's easier than putting up a fight

09:10.092 --> 09:12.762
No one's there
When your dreams at night get creepy

09:12.929 --> 09:15.473
No one cares if you grow
Or if you shrink

09:15.640 --> 09:18.100
No one dries
When your eyes get red and weepy

09:18.267 --> 09:21.687
From the crying you would think
This place would sink

09:31.822 --> 09:33.866
Empty belly life

09:34.700 --> 09:36.994
Rotten smelly life

09:37.411 --> 09:39.997
Full of sorrow life

09:40.164 --> 09:41.540
No tomorrow life

09:41.707 --> 09:44.460
Santa Claus we never see

09:44.627 --> 09:47.421
Santa Claus, what's that?
Who's he?

09:47.588 --> 09:50.216
No one cares for you a smidge

09:50.383 --> 09:53.052
When you're in an orphanage

09:53.219 --> 09:55.471
It's the hard-knock life

10:06.482 --> 10:08.943
You'll stay up till this dump...

10:09.151 --> 10:13.281
...shines like the top
of the Chrysler Building.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.410
Kill, kill.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.245
Yank the whiskers from her chin

10:19.412 --> 10:20.579
Little pig droppings

10:20.746 --> 10:22.081
Jab her with a safety pin

10:22.248 --> 10:23.416
Rotten orphans.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.126
Make her drink a Mickey Finn

10:25.293 --> 10:28.713
- Nobody loves you.
- I love you, Miss Hannigan.

10:28.963 --> 10:30.798
Get to work!

10:31.590 --> 10:33.718
Strip that bed!

10:34.635 --> 10:36.846
Scrub that floor!

10:48.816 --> 10:51.235
Polish my shoes!

10:52.737 --> 10:54.363
And I mean...

10:54.613 --> 10:56.991
...start now!

10:57.658 --> 10:59.660
It's the hard-knock life for us

10:59.827 --> 11:00.870
Mud in your eye!

11:01.037 --> 11:03.205
It's the hard-knock life for us

11:03.372 --> 11:06.042
No one cares for you a smidge

11:06.208 --> 11:09.003
When you're in an orphanage

11:09.170 --> 11:13.591
It's the hard-knock life

11:13.758 --> 11:17.928
The hard-knock life

11:20.514 --> 11:23.059
We better get out of here
or we'll get killed.

11:23.309 --> 11:26.103
- Cover me up good.
- All you ever do is run away.

11:26.354 --> 11:28.439
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

11:28.647 --> 11:30.274
She'll put you in the cellar.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.819
- You'll get whipped again.
- You're gonna get us in trouble.

11:34.070 --> 11:35.446
Molly, shut up!

11:35.654 --> 11:40.451
- I'm gonna tell.
- And I'm gonna rearrange your teeth!

11:41.369 --> 11:42.536
Stomp on her foot!

11:42.745 --> 11:46.207
What are you all
just standing around here for?

11:46.415 --> 11:49.251
You're supposed to clean
the bathroom and kitchen...

11:49.502 --> 11:52.338
...before lunch,
my little pig droppings.

11:52.546 --> 11:56.717
And if you skip the corners,
there will be no lunch.

11:57.218 --> 12:01.097
And we're not having hot mush today.

12:04.934 --> 12:07.144
We're having cold mush.

12:08.145 --> 12:12.817
- What?
- We love you, Miss Hannigan.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.652
Wonderful.

12:15.945 --> 12:16.987
Where's Annie?

12:17.196 --> 12:20.533
- She had to go bathroom.
-"She had to go bathroom."

12:20.783 --> 12:22.993
Miss Hannigan.

12:25.496 --> 12:28.624
- Mr. Bundles.
- Mr. Bundles.

12:44.348 --> 12:48.060
It's time for a tumble with a bundle.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.980
Not today. I'm behind--

12:51.188 --> 12:53.441
My schedule, I mean.

12:53.732 --> 12:57.862
What are schedules in the storms
of passion, Mr. Bundles?

12:58.112 --> 13:01.407
Just so much flotsam and jetsam.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.242
Miss Hannigan, please!

13:06.036 --> 13:08.747
- What are you doing out here?
- Helping you.

13:08.998 --> 13:12.418
- It's heavy today.
- It's a lot heavier than usual.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.838
- It shouldn't be. What's in there?
- Miss Hannigan.

13:16.005 --> 13:17.423
Mr. Bundles.

13:17.590 --> 13:19.091
- Miss Hannigan.
- Yes?

13:19.258 --> 13:22.970
- You're my kind of woman.
- Oh, yes. Yes.

13:23.137 --> 13:25.347
Till next month, Miss Hannigan.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.560
I'll be right here.

13:52.583 --> 13:55.878
Mr. Bundles, I'm in here.

13:59.715 --> 14:02.885
- Thank you, Mr. Bundles.
- Good luck.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.088
Get his tail!

15:23.966 --> 15:25.009
Poor dog.

15:25.551 --> 15:28.429
Leave him alone.
What's he ever done to you?

15:29.221 --> 15:31.307
Amscray!

15:36.729 --> 15:39.440
All right, who's next?

15:45.404 --> 15:46.780
Anybody else?

15:47.031 --> 15:48.824
- Scram, man!
- Let's go!

15:49.033 --> 15:51.535
- Then get lost.
- Let's get a move on!

15:51.702 --> 15:55.122
- Let's hotfoot it!
- Shake a leg! Come on!

15:56.498 --> 15:59.043
Let's go! Come on!

16:05.674 --> 16:07.801
Hey, you're all right.

16:17.269 --> 16:20.939
I didn't do nothing any decent person
wouldn't have done.

16:22.066 --> 16:23.859
Dumb dog.

16:37.456 --> 16:42.503
Dumb dog, why are you following me?

16:42.670 --> 16:45.422
I ainâ€™t got a crumb, dog

16:45.589 --> 16:49.134
How about letting me be?

16:49.301 --> 16:52.054
I ain't gonna feed you

16:52.221 --> 16:55.432
Ain't got a scrap for you
Need you?

16:55.599 --> 16:58.727
Don't give a rap for you, dumb dog

17:00.145 --> 17:02.564
Dumber than they come, dog

17:02.731 --> 17:07.277
You're the most presuming dog

17:07.778 --> 17:13.157
That a human could know

17:24.086 --> 17:26.003
Hey, mister, that's my dog!

17:26.213 --> 17:29.383
Oh, yeah? Where's his license?
Where's his leash?

17:29.633 --> 17:32.261
He's no more your dog
than I am your father.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.471
I left his license at home.

17:34.680 --> 17:38.684
Please don't take him to the pound.
My father's blind.

17:38.892 --> 17:44.231
This dog leads him to work.
If he doesn't work, we'll starve.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.650
What's his name?

17:47.443 --> 17:49.570
My father's name?

17:49.737 --> 17:53.365
- The dog's name.
- Oh, the dog's name!

17:53.615 --> 17:55.492
His name's Sandy.

17:55.743 --> 17:57.077
That's it. Sandy.

17:57.286 --> 17:59.163
Call him.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.248
Call him?

18:02.374 --> 18:04.168
Go over there and call him.

18:04.543 --> 18:06.086
You mean by his name?

18:06.295 --> 18:09.423
By his name. The dog's name.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.976
Sandy! Come here, Sandy.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.605
Sandy! Come here, Sandy!

18:24.813 --> 18:27.024
Here, Rover. Come here, boy.

18:27.274 --> 18:30.068
Rin Tin Tin! Come here.
Come to Daddy.

18:30.277 --> 18:35.324
- Sandy, come here.
- Rin Tin Tin, come here.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.785
Sandy!

18:38.035 --> 18:40.662
Come here, Sandy. Come here, Sandy.
Come here.

18:42.790 --> 18:44.625
Good old Sandy!

18:45.042 --> 18:48.128
You've got yourself a dog.
Get him a collar and a leash.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.047
Yes, sir.

19:27.125 --> 19:30.420
Miss Hannigan! Miss Hannigan!

19:30.629 --> 19:32.172
What?!

19:33.006 --> 19:34.049
Annie!

19:34.258 --> 19:37.386
Look what I found
under a paving stone.

19:37.553 --> 19:39.096
Oh, Annie!

19:39.263 --> 19:43.684
Annie, my little peach fuzz,
are you all right?

19:43.851 --> 19:48.272
- I was worried sick.
- I knew you would be.

19:48.522 --> 19:51.066
A big-hearted woman like you.

19:51.316 --> 19:54.403
How can I ever thank you...

19:54.570 --> 19:55.779
."enough?

19:56.029 --> 19:59.825
I'm sure we can think of something
if we get our heads together.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.244
Kissy, kissy, kissy.

20:02.494 --> 20:05.205
Kill! Kill!

20:13.922 --> 20:19.011
- We love you, Miss Hannigan.
- Sure.

20:24.975 --> 20:28.437
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

20:33.025 --> 20:34.318
He smells.

20:34.526 --> 20:37.446
- What's his name, Annie?
- Guess.

20:38.155 --> 20:39.698
Fifi?

20:40.032 --> 20:42.451
That ain't a name for this mutt.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.371
So how about Champion

20:46.538 --> 20:48.832
Champion, you're anything but

20:50.208 --> 20:54.838
- We could call him Tiger
- But there's no bite in him

20:55.047 --> 20:58.342
Tiger
Kittens would frighten him

20:58.508 --> 21:03.972
Rover
When you think it over

21:04.181 --> 21:09.895
Rover is the perfect name
For this dumb-looking dog

21:10.103 --> 21:11.438
Rover!

21:27.245 --> 21:30.374
Sandy, Sandy's his name

21:30.540 --> 21:32.793
If you please

21:33.210 --> 21:36.296
If you don't believe me

21:36.463 --> 21:40.342
Ask any one of the fleas

21:40.634 --> 21:43.470
Residing on Sandy

21:43.637 --> 21:47.099
<i>True he ain't pedigreed, Sandy</i>

21:47.265 --> 21:49.184
There ain't no better breed

21:49.351 --> 21:55.774
And he really comes in handy

21:55.941 --> 21:59.903
Especially when you're all alone
In the night

22:00.070 --> 22:04.241
And you're small
And terribly frightened

22:04.408 --> 22:06.451
It's Sandy

22:06.618 --> 22:11.123
Sandy who'll always be

22:11.707 --> 22:16.920
There

22:17.379 --> 22:19.214
She's coming. She's coming.

22:19.715 --> 22:21.299
Hide him.

22:39.901 --> 22:43.196
I love you, Miss Hannigan.

22:43.447 --> 22:48.201
And you will love the paddle closet,
Annie!

22:48.910 --> 22:50.537
And this...

22:50.996 --> 22:53.707
...will love the sausage factory.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.334
- No, Miss--
- What?

22:57.377 --> 23:01.173
We love you, Miss Hannigan.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.507
Shut up.

23:04.634 --> 23:08.472
Apples, a nickel. Apples here.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.140
Yes, ma'am.

23:10.307 --> 23:13.185
Here you go. Thank you.
God bless you.

23:13.351 --> 23:15.479
Apples here.

23:15.729 --> 23:18.815
Big, delicious apples here.

23:49.554 --> 23:52.015
All right! All right!

23:53.850 --> 23:54.893
Yeah?

23:55.644 --> 23:57.854
Miss Hannigan, I'm Grace Farrell.

23:58.021 --> 24:00.107
The New York Board of Orphans
sent me.

24:02.275 --> 24:05.362
My goodness, won't you come in?

24:05.570 --> 24:07.864
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

24:08.657 --> 24:10.575
Well, welcome.

24:10.742 --> 24:13.245
- Welcome to our happy home.
- Off my foot, Molly!

24:13.411 --> 24:14.454
- Thank you.
- Ladies.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.039
Smell that perfume.

24:16.206 --> 24:18.041
- And your name was?
- Grace Farrell.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.961
- She wants a girl to clean her house.
- Aptly named.

24:21.128 --> 24:24.756
- I bet it's gonna be me!
- I'm here to inquire about an orphan.

24:25.340 --> 24:28.927
Grace, I can explain the whole thing.
What happened was...

24:29.136 --> 24:33.974
...the child bribed Mr. Bundles
to smuggle her out of here.

24:34.224 --> 24:37.519
I should've called Mr. Donatelli,
but the truth is...

24:37.727 --> 24:40.313
...I just saw red,
so I called the cops instead.

24:40.480 --> 24:44.359
Anyway she's back, everything's fine.
All's well that ends well.

24:44.609 --> 24:47.529
No harm, no foul,
my little scissors legs?

24:47.988 --> 24:50.866
What are you talking about?

24:53.285 --> 24:58.415
Are you peddling beauty products?
I don't need beauty products.

24:59.082 --> 25:03.962
If that's what you're doing,
peddle yourself right out of here.

25:04.171 --> 25:08.550
I am the private secretary
to Oliver Warbucks.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.927
The Oliver Warbucks?

25:12.387 --> 25:16.933
- Oliver Warbucks the millionaire?
- No, the billionaire.

25:18.310 --> 25:19.936
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

25:20.145 --> 25:24.816
Mr. Warbucks would like to invite
an orphan to spend a week with him.

25:25.609 --> 25:26.943
I'm here to select one.

25:27.194 --> 25:29.321
That's just wonderful.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.907
What kind of orphan did he
have in mind?

25:32.115 --> 25:33.950
Well...

25:34.117 --> 25:35.660
...friendly.

25:36.411 --> 25:37.454
Intelligent.

25:37.829 --> 25:41.958
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.002
And I'1aPPY-

25:58.808 --> 26:02.854
- How old?
- Well, age doesn't really matter.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.150
Seven.

26:08.318 --> 26:11.655
Eight. Nine.

26:12.239 --> 26:13.281
Ten?

26:13.490 --> 26:15.408
Yes, 10 is just fine.

26:15.659 --> 26:17.202
Ten?

26:17.369 --> 26:19.663
I'm sorry, I almost forgot.

26:19.829 --> 26:24.584
- Mr. Warbucks prefers red hair.
- A 10-year-old redhead?

26:24.834 --> 26:27.254
Nope. Sorry, ain't got it.

26:27.462 --> 26:29.798
What about this child?

26:30.048 --> 26:32.384
- Annie?
- Yes.

26:34.844 --> 26:36.805
You don't want Annie.

26:37.055 --> 26:38.807
Why not?

26:39.975 --> 26:41.643
She's...

26:41.935 --> 26:43.270
She's a drunk.

26:44.938 --> 26:46.815
Fiddle-faddle.

26:47.065 --> 26:50.568
How'd you like to spend a week
with Mr. Warbucks at his house?

26:51.152 --> 26:55.240
Oh, boy! I would love to.
I would really, really love to.

26:55.490 --> 26:58.118
Wait! Slow down!
Hold on there!

26:58.868 --> 27:02.205
You can have any orphan in the whole
orphanage except Annie.

27:02.372 --> 27:03.415
Why?

27:03.623 --> 27:08.128
She's got it coming to her,
and I don't mean a week of luxury.

27:08.378 --> 27:11.381
- She's got to learn to know her place.
- Her place?

27:11.631 --> 27:13.258
Annie is entirely too cheeky.

27:13.842 --> 27:17.512
- Mr. Warbucks likes cheeky orphans.
- Tough!

27:18.263 --> 27:22.726
I assume your resistance has to do with
Mr. Donatelli and the Board of Orphans.

27:22.976 --> 27:24.978
Don't assume nothing, sweetheart.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.063
Mr. Warbucks knows Mr. Donatelli.

27:27.314 --> 27:29.190
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, it is.

27:29.399 --> 27:34.362
It's also a fact that he said how many
people he had lined up for your job.

27:36.906 --> 27:38.408
- Is that a fact?
- Yes.

27:38.950 --> 27:42.287
It's awful to be out of work,
isn't it, Miss Hannigan?

27:45.248 --> 27:46.708
Just terrible.

27:47.083 --> 27:48.501
Leaping lizards!

27:48.752 --> 27:52.839
-"Leaping lizards."
- The limousine is waiting.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.011
- My dog.
- What?

27:58.803 --> 28:01.014
Here, Sandy. Come here.

28:01.306 --> 28:03.725
He's really nice. Really good.

28:03.933 --> 28:06.644
He never jumps up on people.

28:08.563 --> 28:13.526
He's a very sweet dog, but really,
I don't think Mr. Warbucks--

28:13.735 --> 28:16.237
- Then I'm not coming.
- What?

28:16.488 --> 28:19.157
She's going to send him to
the sausage factory.

28:19.449 --> 28:22.786
- She said so herself.
- I'm not zoned for dogs.

28:22.994 --> 28:26.873
- We'll take the dog.
- Oh, boy!

28:32.670 --> 28:34.214
Bye, Annie!

28:35.799 --> 28:39.177
I'll be back.
I'll bring everybody presents.

28:46.643 --> 28:51.189
Bye, Molly. See you soon.
Bye, Pepper. Bye, Duffy.

29:31.229 --> 29:34.858
Is this a train station?
Are we going on a train?

29:35.066 --> 29:37.819
No, this is Mr. Warbucks' house.

29:44.242 --> 29:45.994
Leaping lizards.

30:00.675 --> 30:05.180
This is Punjab. He and the Asp
are Mr. Warbucks' bodyguards.

30:07.223 --> 30:09.851
Come along. Let's get you settled.

31:17.085 --> 31:18.753
Been to the zoo, Miss Farrell?

31:18.962 --> 31:20.213
Not recently, Drake.

31:20.380 --> 31:22.340
- Has the organ been tuned?
- Yes, miss.

31:22.507 --> 31:23.550
- Pool heated?
- Yes.

31:23.716 --> 31:25.093
- Tennis net up?
- Yes.

31:25.260 --> 31:26.636
- French doors fixed?
- Yes.

31:26.803 --> 31:28.304
- Elevator oiled?
- Yes.

31:28.471 --> 31:29.847
- Typewriter repaired?
- Yes.

31:30.098 --> 31:31.766
- Second Teletype installed?
- Yes.

31:32.016 --> 31:35.812
- Are you allergic to dogs, Drake?
- No, filth.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.481
- Is dinner under way, Mrs. Pugh?
- Yes, miss.

31:38.648 --> 31:41.859
Preparing his favorite.
Texas grapefruit, Virginia ham...

31:42.026 --> 31:47.073
...Idaho potatoes, Wisconsin cheese,
Washington apples and baked Alaska.

31:47.407 --> 31:50.159
I have an announcement to make.

31:50.410 --> 31:54.372
This is Annie, and she'll
be staying with us for a week.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.791
This is her dog, Sandy.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.335
He'll be staying with me.

31:59.502 --> 32:01.504
May I take your sweater, miss?

32:01.713 --> 32:05.008
- Will I get it back?
- Of course, miss!

32:06.551 --> 32:09.554
What would you like to do first?

32:14.892 --> 32:19.814
The windows, then the floors,
that way if I drip--

32:21.399 --> 32:25.945
You don't understand. You don't
have to do any cleaning here.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.488
I won't?

32:27.655 --> 32:29.407
How am I gonna earn my keep?

32:29.574 --> 32:31.868
You're our guest, Annie.

32:32.535 --> 32:35.496
Cecilie will pick out all your clothes

32:35.663 --> 32:38.499
Blue is her best color.
No, red, I think.

32:38.666 --> 32:41.669
Your bath is drawn by Mrs. Greer

32:41.836 --> 32:44.672
Soap. No, bubbles, I think.

32:44.839 --> 32:47.717
Annette comes in to make your bed

32:47.884 --> 32:50.720
The silk? No, the satin sheets, I think.

32:50.887 --> 32:54.432
I think I'm gonna like it here

33:31.260 --> 33:34.263
The swimming pool is down the stairs

33:34.430 --> 33:37.100
Inside the house? Oh, boy!

33:37.266 --> 33:40.353
The tennis court is in the rear

33:40.520 --> 33:43.481
- I never even picked up a racket.
- What?

33:43.648 --> 33:46.234
Have an instructor here at noon

33:46.401 --> 33:49.278
And get that Don Budge fellow,
if he's available.

33:49.445 --> 33:53.741
I think I'm gonna like it here

34:10.800 --> 34:13.844
When you wake, ring for Drake

34:14.011 --> 34:17.056
Drake will bring your tray

34:17.223 --> 34:24.105
When you're through
Mrs. Pugh comes to take it away

34:27.190 --> 34:31.571
- Annie!
- Come on, Annie! Come on!

34:33.114 --> 34:36.409
No need to pick up any toys

34:36.576 --> 34:39.286
That's okay, I haven't got any anyway.

34:39.454 --> 34:45.208
No finger will you lift, my dear

34:45.376 --> 34:48.420
We have but one request

34:48.588 --> 34:51.507
Please put us to the test

34:51.674 --> 34:58.055
I know I'm gonna like it here

35:09.192 --> 35:15.156
Used to room in a tomb
Where I'd sit and freeze

35:15.323 --> 35:18.326
Get me now, holy cow

35:18.493 --> 35:22.705
Could someone pinch me, please?

35:23.456 --> 35:26.000
Hold still. Hold still!

35:26.167 --> 35:28.169
You mutt!

36:07.083 --> 36:08.334
Hi, Annie!

36:08.543 --> 36:10.878
Got something for you.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.557
Here you are, Annie.

36:26.811 --> 36:29.605
We've never had a little girl

36:29.772 --> 36:32.900
We've never had a little girl
We've never had a little girl

36:33.067 --> 36:35.903
I'm very, very, very glad to volunteer

36:36.070 --> 36:39.240
I'm glad she's glad to volunteer

36:39.407 --> 36:42.159
We hope you understand

36:42.326 --> 36:45.329
Your wish is our command

36:45.496 --> 36:51.043
- I know I'm gonna like it here
- We know you're gonna like it here

36:59.051 --> 37:01.971
It's Mr. Warbucks. Don't worry now.

37:09.270 --> 37:11.731
- Welcome home, sir.
- Did the painting arrive?

37:11.939 --> 37:14.567
They're just uncrating it, sir.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.789
I don't like it. Send it back.
Any messages?

37:29.040 --> 37:32.835
President Roosevelt called three
times. He said it was urgent.

37:33.044 --> 37:35.504
Everything's urgent to a Democrat.
What else?

37:35.713 --> 37:39.592
Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Vanderbilt,
Mr. DuPont, Mr. Carnegie.

37:39.842 --> 37:43.971
Wait! There's something interesting
in that woman's smile.

37:44.180 --> 37:48.142
I might learn to like her.
Hang her in my bathroom.

37:48.392 --> 37:52.188
No time for dinner tonight. Send out
for an American cheese sandwich.

37:52.396 --> 37:54.565
Come, let's get started.

37:58.027 --> 37:59.987
What the devil's going on here?

38:00.237 --> 38:04.116
This is the press representative.
Your image.

38:05.618 --> 38:07.244
Oh, yes.

38:08.746 --> 38:12.875
Pick him up, Punjab.
Get him another camera.

38:23.386 --> 38:26.847
Why do I smell wet dog'?

38:29.976 --> 38:32.478
Because we gave Sandy a bath.

38:32.728 --> 38:34.146
What's this?

38:34.355 --> 38:37.733
This is Annie, the orphan
who will be staying with us.

38:37.984 --> 38:39.485
What are you talking about?

38:40.695 --> 38:44.365
They wanted to take photos of you
sharing your home with an orphan.

38:44.532 --> 38:45.700
Only for a week.

38:45.950 --> 38:49.328
This doesn't look like a boy!
Orphans are boys.

38:49.578 --> 38:52.957
You didn't say a boy. You
just said an orphan, so I got a girl.

38:53.165 --> 38:54.417
I want a boy!

38:56.168 --> 38:59.005
I've got an interesting
smile too, sir.

38:59.255 --> 39:04.385
Couldn't you learn to like me, sir?
Hang me in the bathroom?

39:04.802 --> 39:08.681
- Take them back now.
- Sir, she just got here.

39:08.931 --> 39:11.892
That's okay, Miss Farrell.
We'll be okay.

39:12.393 --> 39:17.189
It was nice meeting you anyhow.
I sure do like your place.

39:17.440 --> 39:21.527
- Thank you, Annette.
- Annie. I've had a swell time.

39:21.777 --> 39:25.448
The Asp drove us here in
a car the size of a train.

39:25.698 --> 39:27.825
And Punjab put a spell on Sandy.

39:28.409 --> 39:31.620
We made Drake sneeze.
And I played your pipe organ.

39:31.829 --> 39:34.832
Sandy got a bubble bath.

39:35.082 --> 39:38.085
I've had enough fun
to last me for years.

39:38.335 --> 39:41.630
It's a really swell idea
to have an orphan for a week.

39:42.339 --> 39:44.383
A really terrific idea.

39:44.550 --> 39:48.054
Even if it is only for your image,
even if I'm not the orphan...

39:48.220 --> 39:51.932
-...I'm glad you're doing it.
- I'm glad you approve.

39:52.141 --> 39:53.809
Let's get to work!

39:54.060 --> 39:57.188
Are you sure you need a boy?
Couldn't she stay?

39:57.438 --> 40:00.608
Whatever, but just for the week.

40:04.612 --> 40:06.781
- You know what?
- What?

40:07.031 --> 40:10.284
- I love you.
- I know.

40:10.534 --> 40:14.955
- Kiss me as only you can.
- You devil.

40:20.544 --> 40:22.588
Get away!

40:33.182 --> 40:38.187
Little girls, little girls
Everywhere I turn

40:38.354 --> 40:41.148
I can see them

40:42.608 --> 40:44.819
Little girls, little girls

40:44.985 --> 40:50.241
Night and day
I eat, sleep and breathe them

40:50.407 --> 40:53.828
I'm an ordinary woman

40:53.994 --> 40:56.789
With feelings

40:56.956 --> 41:01.043
I'd like a man to nibble on my ear

41:01.210 --> 41:06.215
But I'll admit, no man has bit

41:06.382 --> 41:11.178
So how come
I'm the mother of the year?

41:11.345 --> 41:14.640
How I hate little shoes, little socks

41:14.807 --> 41:19.520
And each little bloomer

41:20.771 --> 41:23.023
I'd have cracked years ago

41:23.190 --> 41:29.446
If it weren't for my sense of humor

41:30.322 --> 41:34.785
Some women are dripping
With diamonds

41:34.952 --> 41:39.748
Some women are dripping with pearls

41:39.915 --> 41:45.421
Lucky me, lucky me
Look at what I'm dripping with

41:45.588 --> 41:48.591
Little girls

42:10.905 --> 42:16.702
Little cheeks, little teeth
Everything around me is

42:16.869 --> 42:18.871
Little

42:20.206 --> 42:22.416
<i>If I wring little necks</i>

42:22.583 --> 42:29.465
Surely I would get an acquittal

42:29.632 --> 42:34.303
Someday I'll step on their freckles

42:34.470 --> 42:39.183
Some night I'll straighten their curls

42:39.350 --> 42:41.685
Send a flood, send the flu

42:41.852 --> 42:46.815
Anything that you can do
To little, little, little

42:48.651 --> 42:51.737
Little, little, little

42:53.822 --> 42:58.410
Little girls

43:05.501 --> 43:10.214
Someday I'll /and in the nuthouse

43:10.381 --> 43:14.510
With all the nuts and the squirrels

43:14.677 --> 43:20.099
There I'll stay, tucked away
Till the prohibition of

43:20.266 --> 43:24.687
Little

43:24.853 --> 43:28.774
Girls

43:39.952 --> 43:42.579
- Rooster!
- Sis.

43:43.831 --> 43:46.292
You're supposed to be in jail.

43:46.500 --> 43:49.128
- They let me out early.
- For good behavior.

43:49.336 --> 43:53.716
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Lily St. Regis.

43:53.966 --> 43:57.928
- Named from the hotel.
- Room service.

43:58.178 --> 44:03.142
This afternoon, I put 10 on the nose
of a beautiful horse at 8-1.

44:03.392 --> 44:06.478
Sure enough, the scum-bum
took off and whipped the pack.

44:06.645 --> 44:07.855
No kidding?

44:08.105 --> 44:13.485
The thing is, I got delayed
and I didn't have time to cash in.

44:13.652 --> 44:18.907
Eighty bucks, sis, first thing
in the morning, guaranteed.

44:19.158 --> 44:23.329
All I need is 5 to tide me over.

44:23.954 --> 44:26.790
Not even a nickel for the subway.

44:26.999 --> 44:29.501
Come on, sis.

44:31.628 --> 44:36.759
I bet Miss Sticky-Fingers here
can loan you a lousy 5 bucks.

44:37.259 --> 44:39.303
I beg your pardon, I'm sure.

44:39.553 --> 44:43.932
But I don't stoop to what you're
incinerating.

44:44.767 --> 44:47.227
Give me back my goods, toots.

45:04.745 --> 45:06.455
Okay, Rooster.

45:06.663 --> 45:11.210
If I loan you 5 bucks, will you
take this dumb hotel out of here?

45:11.418 --> 45:13.462
I'm sorry, sis. Lily.

45:14.421 --> 45:17.299
Not even a nickel for the subway.

45:17.758 --> 45:20.177
You and her have the same mother?

45:38.821 --> 45:40.864
Rooster!

45:50.916 --> 45:55.254
Betcha he reads
Betcha she sews

45:55.421 --> 45:59.299
Maybe she's made me
A closet of clothes

45:59.466 --> 46:04.054
Maybe they're strict
As straight as a line

46:04.221 --> 46:10.102
Don't really care
As long as they're mine

46:11.520 --> 46:16.483
So maybe now this prayer's

46:16.650 --> 46:21.447
The last one of its kind

46:21.613 --> 46:26.910
Won't you please come get your baby?

46:27.077 --> 46:31.248
Maybe

46:42.718 --> 46:45.762
This room's bigger than Grant's tomb.

46:47.097 --> 46:48.682
Me too.

46:50.601 --> 46:53.061
Come on, Sandy. Come on!

46:57.357 --> 46:58.525
In conclusion...

46:58.734 --> 47:03.697
...because your country has raised its
voice loud and clear for democracy...

47:03.947 --> 47:07.034
...I will extend to you a credit line...

47:07.242 --> 47:09.828
...for 35 of my new fighter-bombers.

47:10.329 --> 47:15.000
That will come with a year's supply
of spare parts and ammunition--

47:15.250 --> 47:16.460
What's this?

47:16.668 --> 47:20.547
Sandy's not used to sleeping
by himself. He gets lonesome.

47:22.341 --> 47:23.425
Where were we?

47:24.426 --> 47:27.012
-"Ammunition," sir.
- Are you getting a lot done?

47:27.221 --> 47:30.641
I'd get a lot more done
if certain people...

47:31.808 --> 47:35.979
If Franklin Delano Roosevelt
would leave me alone.

47:36.230 --> 47:37.856
Six calls since I got home.

47:38.065 --> 47:41.652
- What's he want?
- My support for the New Deal.

47:41.902 --> 47:44.696
He is our president, sir.

47:45.113 --> 47:46.615
Punjab!

47:47.074 --> 47:51.578
Remove this animal and its young
mistress along with it.

47:52.120 --> 47:57.125
Dear Richie, this letter will serve
as confirmation of correspondence...

47:57.334 --> 48:02.172
...concerning the details
of your extended deferment.

48:03.799 --> 48:05.300
--On or before September 1.

48:05.551 --> 48:10.597
If you cannot meet that deadline,
you will be charged interest.

48:10.847 --> 48:13.976
Six percent. Cordially, et cetera.

48:16.979 --> 48:22.109
P.S. One of my companies
is developing bomb-proof glass.

48:22.484 --> 48:28.365
This may be of interest to you
if the global situation deteriorates.

48:31.660 --> 48:34.955
- What was that?
- Well done, Sandy.

48:35.163 --> 48:38.375
- Was that man trying to kill you?
- That will be all.

48:38.625 --> 48:40.836
Yes, sir. Come along, dear.

48:42.004 --> 48:44.798
- Who'd want to kill Mr. Warbucks?
- The Bolsheviks.

48:45.048 --> 48:47.509
He's proof that
the American system works...

48:47.718 --> 48:50.178
...and Bolsheviks don't
want anyone to know.

48:50.679 --> 48:53.849
The Bolsheviks? Leaping lizards!

49:04.526 --> 49:07.821
Get your dog out of my pool!

49:07.988 --> 49:11.450
He thought you were drowning.
He was trying to save your life.

49:11.617 --> 49:16.038
- Go on, you mutt. Get out of here.
- Come on.

49:26.715 --> 49:28.508
Like my suit?

49:28.842 --> 49:30.260
What? Oh, yes.

49:30.469 --> 49:32.095
Miss Farrell picked it out.

49:32.304 --> 49:37.017
- Never thought I'd get used to a girl.
- Girls are easier to get used to.

49:37.267 --> 49:41.396
Like Miss Farrell,
she does all the work around here.

49:41.647 --> 49:45.025
- You don't know her first name.
- I do. It's Grace.

49:45.233 --> 49:48.987
She thinks you're the greatest thing
since sliced bread.

49:49.196 --> 49:50.238
I beg your pardon.

49:50.447 --> 49:54.826
I know it's none of my business,
but you never notice anything.

49:58.789 --> 50:00.874
Sliced bread.

50:01.583 --> 50:06.713
Wilhelm, please offer your son my
congratulations on his engagement.

50:07.172 --> 50:11.134
Hold on. Buy copper.

50:11.385 --> 50:16.515
Tell the crown prince
that my yacht in Monte Carlo...

50:16.765 --> 50:21.728
...is entirely at his disposal.

50:21.937 --> 50:25.482
Hold on. More copper.

50:25.691 --> 50:29.486
- Don't encourage her, Punjab.
- Maybe I should take her out.

50:29.736 --> 50:34.950
- Where do you want to go?
- To meet President Roosevelt.

50:36.910 --> 50:42.040
- How about a movie?
- Pepper went to a movie once.

50:42.332 --> 50:46.503
She said it was swell,
and Miss Hannigan goes all the time.

50:46.753 --> 50:50.924
- Take her to the Radio City Music Hall.
- Aren't you going to take me?

50:51.174 --> 50:55.011
Me? Annie, you may think
that Miss Farrell does all the work...

50:55.262 --> 50:59.057
...but I'm a very busy man.

50:59.307 --> 51:02.185
I know. Didn't mean
to get in the way, Mr. Warbucks.

51:02.394 --> 51:06.356
Nobody has to take me.
I'll go practice my backhand.

51:10.902 --> 51:15.949
Pepper lies a lot. She probably
hasn't been to a movie either.

51:16.616 --> 51:20.746
Actually, I think it's better when
you don't know what you're missing.

51:23.707 --> 51:29.629
Punjab, buy out the 8:00 show.
Let's all go to the movies.

51:34.176 --> 51:39.765
- You should leave your hair down.
- No, I couldn't.

51:39.931 --> 51:42.601
Miss Hannigan says
a man don't look at your brains.

51:42.768 --> 51:44.644
Oh, really? My goodness.

51:44.811 --> 51:47.689
Come on, let's go to the movies.

51:47.939 --> 51:50.400
Let's go see the stars.

51:51.234 --> 51:53.445
Cowboy heroes

51:53.612 --> 51:55.405
Cops and robbers

51:55.572 --> 51:57.491
Glamour and strife

51:57.657 --> 52:00.118
Bigger than life

52:03.914 --> 52:08.043
Sitting in the darkness

52:08.210 --> 52:12.380
What a world to see

52:12.547 --> 52:16.551
Let's go to the movies, Annie

52:16.718 --> 52:21.598
Wait and see

52:23.058 --> 52:24.893
Bette Davis is probably lying

52:25.060 --> 52:27.145
And Greta Garbo is probably crying

52:27.312 --> 52:31.733
While Robert Taylor
Is locked in her dying embrace

52:31.900 --> 52:36.071
Chico and Groucho and Chaplin
And Lloyd are all super

52:36.238 --> 52:37.906
Sweet Mickey Mouse
Shirley Temple

52:38.073 --> 52:39.574
And dear Jackie Cooper

52:39.741 --> 52:43.328
Let's go to the movies

52:43.495 --> 52:47.916
Let's go see the stars

52:52.087 --> 52:54.297
Fred and Ginger

52:54.464 --> 52:56.842
Spinning madly

53:13.567 --> 53:18.488
Anything you can imagine

53:20.407 --> 53:22.576
Songs and romance

53:22.742 --> 53:25.161
Life is a dance

53:27.664 --> 53:32.002
Sitting in the darkness

53:32.168 --> 53:36.590
Popcorn on your knee

53:36.756 --> 53:40.886
Give the maid the night off

53:42.178 --> 53:45.223
Turn the kitchen light off.

53:45.640 --> 53:50.186
Let's go to the movies, Annie

53:50.353 --> 53:55.025
You and me

54:22.886 --> 54:26.348
Welcome to the movies

54:26.514 --> 54:30.143
Welcome to the stars

54:30.310 --> 54:33.855
Welcome to this
Grand illusion

54:34.022 --> 54:35.732
All of it's yours

54:35.899 --> 54:37.901
Right through these doors

54:39.778 --> 54:43.281
Every plot's a dilly

54:43.448 --> 54:46.785
This we guarantee

54:47.160 --> 54:50.789
Welcome to the movies

54:51.122 --> 54:54.084
Wait and see

55:12.352 --> 55:14.688
Let's go to the movies

55:16.564 --> 55:20.735
Let's go see the stars

55:20.902 --> 55:23.321
Headlines holler

55:23.488 --> 55:25.156
Big depression

55:25.323 --> 55:27.367
What do we care?

55:27.534 --> 55:29.911
Movies are there

55:30.286 --> 55:34.457
Only happy endings
Boy get's girl

55:34.624 --> 55:38.545
That's our recipe

55:38.712 --> 55:41.965
Welcome to our lovely

55:42.132 --> 55:45.844
M-O- V-I-E

56:18.585 --> 56:21.796
We love to go to RKO

56:21.963 --> 56:25.258
Columbia, Universal

56:25.425 --> 56:28.678
Jack Warner and Sam Goldwyn and

56:28.845 --> 56:32.432
MGM and Zanuck
Here's to

56:32.599 --> 56:35.018
Dreams of glory

56:35.185 --> 56:37.562
Cast of thousands

56:39.439 --> 56:41.649
Bigger than life

56:44.736 --> 56:47.489
Bigger than life

56:50.116 --> 56:55.413
Only happy endings

56:56.956 --> 57:01.252
That's our recipe

57:02.837 --> 57:04.756
So welcome

57:04.923 --> 57:08.676
To the movies

57:10.386 --> 57:12.847
Wait

57:13.014 --> 57:15.433
And

57:15.600 --> 57:17.519
See

57:36.162 --> 57:38.790
<i>For the "lady of the camellias</i>

57:41.251 --> 57:47.423
<i>- They're twice as large as usual.
- I'll have twice as many as usual</i>

57:47.715 --> 57:52.387
Twice as many?
I know what those things cost.

57:52.554 --> 57:55.682
And when she orders her hats
and dresses from you?

57:55.849 --> 57:57.225
They're an investment.

57:57.392 --> 58:02.188
You won't be young forever.
It's time you settled your future.

58:02.856 --> 58:05.733
I know the very man for you.

58:05.900 --> 58:08.361
- Really?
- Yes, really.

58:11.364 --> 58:16.161
- No one has ever loved you as I do.
- True, but what can I do about it?

58:18.121 --> 58:21.416
You should go away
and not see me anymore.

58:24.627 --> 58:30.091
Don't go in anger. Laugh at yourself
a little, as I laugh at myself.

58:30.258 --> 58:34.137
Come and talk to me once in a while
in a friendly way.

58:35.471 --> 58:37.390
That's too much and not enough.

58:37.557 --> 58:40.226
Believe in love, Marguerite.

58:40.476 --> 58:41.978
So you do love him.

58:44.439 --> 58:48.318
Dare to tell me that you love him,
and you're free of me forever.

58:50.486 --> 58:52.071
I love him.

58:57.535 --> 59:01.915
Come in here, all of you.
See this woman? You know her.

59:02.165 --> 59:04.459
Listen to what I'm going to say.

59:04.626 --> 59:07.086
I accepted her favors.
I thought she loved me.

59:07.337 --> 59:10.256
Let her make sacrifices
when others had more to give.

59:10.423 --> 59:13.718
But bear witness, I owe her nothing.

59:13.927 --> 59:15.553
Take it. Go on, take it.

59:15.803 --> 59:19.891
<i>Buy camellias. Buy diamonds
Buy carriages. Buy a grave.</i>

59:20.725 --> 59:26.272
You know how to treat a woman as she
deserves. Like the cheat this one is.

59:33.112 --> 59:34.822
Marguerite.

59:41.162 --> 59:42.914
Oh, it's you.

59:45.041 --> 59:47.543
I've been down in the street
half the night...

59:47.710 --> 59:49.754
walking under your window...

59:49.921 --> 59:54.550
...wanting to come up,
but not daring to. I felt so guilty.

59:55.343 --> 59:58.012
Don't think such things, Marguerite.

59:58.179 --> 01:00:00.515
Even if we can't
go to the country today...

01:00:00.765 --> 01:00:05.478
...think of how happy we were once
and how happy we'll be again.

01:00:05.728 --> 01:00:09.857
<i>Think of the day you found
the four-leaf clover.</i>

01:00:10.066 --> 01:00:15.113
Think of the vows that
we're going to make to each other.

01:00:15.989 --> 01:00:18.408
This is for life, Marguerite.

01:00:21.703 --> 01:00:22.996
Marguerite.

01:00:28.501 --> 01:00:30.086
Marguerite.

01:00:32.964 --> 01:00:36.968
No, don't leave me.
Marguerite, come back.

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:55.004
Get her nightgown
behind the bathroom door.

01:01:55.171 --> 01:01:57.590
Certainly.

01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:36.504
- Miss Farrell.
- It's all right.

01:02:38.131 --> 01:02:40.174
- How did you learn that?
- Learn what?

01:02:40.425 --> 01:02:42.176
- That.
- What?

01:02:42.385 --> 01:02:45.179
- You put her to bed.
- You put her to bed too.

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:47.265
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

01:02:47.515 --> 01:02:49.517
Good heavens.

01:03:12.081 --> 01:03:17.920
- That was a wonderful evening.
- I have to close a factory.

01:03:18.087 --> 01:03:20.840
- About Annie.
- What about Annie?

01:03:21.299 --> 01:03:23.092
Could we keep her?

01:03:24.552 --> 01:03:29.348
You haven't seen that orphanage.
I can't bear to send her back there.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.101
Get a hold of yourself.
What's come over you?

01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:36.564
I'd take care of her.
You have plenty of room here.

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:42.028
- We could take her on as your ward.
- Absolutely not.

01:03:42.195 --> 01:03:44.155
I love money. I love power.

01:03:44.405 --> 01:03:47.700
I do not now,
nor ever will, love children.

01:03:52.538 --> 01:03:56.667
Watching you with her last night,
I thought maybe...

01:03:58.169 --> 01:03:59.378
Yes?

01:04:07.637 --> 01:04:11.516
- I've just noticed something.
- Yes?

01:04:11.766 --> 01:04:15.228
You're awfully pretty
when you argue with me.

01:04:18.147 --> 01:04:20.441
- Thank you, sir.
- Oliver.

01:04:27.323 --> 01:04:32.328
Do you just love money and power
and capitalism?

01:04:33.663 --> 01:04:36.082
They'll never love you back.

01:04:36.332 --> 01:04:39.627
- Your teeth are crooked.
- I'll have them fixed.

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:43.965
- I like them crooked.
- I'll leave them.

01:04:44.632 --> 01:04:46.092
Thank you.

01:04:48.553 --> 01:04:51.305
I could have the papers signed
this morning.

01:04:54.850 --> 01:05:01.315
- It means a great deal to you.
- Yes, it means a great deal to me.

01:05:01.482 --> 01:05:04.235
I'll do it myself.

01:05:08.197 --> 01:05:10.283
I could just kiss you!

01:05:14.036 --> 01:05:16.831
Grace, get her a little gift.

01:05:17.081 --> 01:05:18.624
That's a good idea.

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:20.876
Something from Tiffany's. A locket.

01:05:22.795 --> 01:05:27.133
Be careful at that orphanage.
That woman's got claws and fangs.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:44.483
We got Annie.

01:05:49.155 --> 01:05:51.907
- We've got Annie?
- Yeah.

01:05:59.123 --> 01:06:01.751
She's like a shine on your shoes

01:06:01.917 --> 01:06:04.545
Or hearing a blues
That's great

01:06:10.092 --> 01:06:11.385
Makes you relax

01:06:11.552 --> 01:06:14.388
Like a big tax rebate

01:06:15.431 --> 01:06:17.058
We got Annie

01:06:20.227 --> 01:06:21.812
We got Annie

01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:24.565
And Benny Goodman's got swing

01:06:24.732 --> 01:06:27.902
Bing is the king, by far

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:33.407
Mutt has got Jeff
And Eleanor, FDR

01:06:39.872 --> 01:06:41.415
- We got Annie
- We got Annie

01:06:41.582 --> 01:06:43.042
We got Annie

01:06:54.136 --> 01:06:56.138
We got Annie

01:07:13.698 --> 01:07:15.825
We got Annie

01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:47.773
Annie

01:07:48.149 --> 01:07:52.403
It's a hard-knock life for us.

01:07:53.404 --> 01:07:58.159
It's a hard-knock life for us.

01:07:58.409 --> 01:08:03.038
No one cares for you a smidge...

01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:06.625
...when you're in an orphanage.

01:08:08.127 --> 01:08:11.881
What are you doing?

01:08:15.718 --> 01:08:20.221
Why aren't you marching in line
with the rest of them?

01:08:21.724 --> 01:08:26.812
Duffy, come here. Come on.

01:08:29.231 --> 01:08:35.488
You're hiding something
from Miss Hannigan behind your back.

01:08:35.654 --> 01:08:40.033
- No.
- Let me have it.

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:47.332
Get inside!

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:56.509
I've seen his picture in the paper
with President Roosevelt.

01:09:09.438 --> 01:09:12.649
- Hannigan, I presume?
- Yes.

01:09:12.858 --> 01:09:15.486
I want to talk to you about Annie.

01:09:16.487 --> 01:09:19.865
You want to return her and forget it,
or trade up?

01:09:20.366 --> 01:09:22.368
I want to adopt her.

01:09:23.035 --> 01:09:25.496
Would you excuse me for a moment?

01:09:34.546 --> 01:09:37.591
- Would you care to step into my office?
- Thank you.

01:09:44.014 --> 01:09:46.559
Hi, sweetie.

01:09:48.102 --> 01:09:50.104
Little cutie.

01:09:52.398 --> 01:09:54.066
This way.

01:09:58.946 --> 01:10:01.782
- Welcome.
- Miss Hannigan--

01:10:01.991 --> 01:10:07.162
Mr. Warbucks, for a Republican,
you are sinfully handsome.

01:10:07.329 --> 01:10:08.372
Thank you.

01:10:08.539 --> 01:10:13.460
I go absolutely weak in the knees
over men like you.

01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:18.299
- My God, is that thing real?
- Just sign the papers.

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:21.677
Would you like to see the bedroom,
my billiard ball?

01:10:23.554 --> 01:10:24.597
Sign.

01:10:24.763 --> 01:10:28.392
- I make a very dry martini.
- Right here.

01:10:28.642 --> 01:10:33.147
- I make a very wet soufflÃ©.
- Just your name.

01:10:33.397 --> 01:10:38.527
- Don't be so mean, you mean meanie.
- Come, my dear.

01:10:38.903 --> 01:10:43.824
<i>Let's you and</i> me <i>make
Why shouldn't we make hay?</i>

01:10:43.991 --> 01:10:48.162
- I have an appointment at 1.
- This way.

01:10:53.375 --> 01:10:56.629
- You ever been to Buenos Aires
- Where?

01:10:56.795 --> 01:11:00.591
- I hunger for the Argentine
- Argentine.

01:11:00.758 --> 01:11:04.261
- Let's me and you fill up our diaries
- What? Stop!

01:11:04.428 --> 01:11:06.055
- Buy me a ruby
- No!

01:11:06.221 --> 01:11:10.768
<i>Why shouldn't you be mine?</i>

01:11:15.022 --> 01:11:18.734
- Come close, madame
- I got your number, you like to rumba

01:11:18.901 --> 01:11:22.571
<i>- While we pry through this
- I'll call you Ollie, my hot tamale</i>

01:11:22.738 --> 01:11:28.494
- And now I gotcha, my cucaracha
- File from my private eye

01:11:30.079 --> 01:11:33.457
- You spend evenings in the shanties
- You had me followed?

01:11:33.624 --> 01:11:37.169
- Imbibing quarts of bathtub gin
- Bronchitis.

01:11:37.336 --> 01:11:40.923
- You're dancing in your scanties
- Great gams.

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:44.718
- With some old geezer, Little Caesar
- He's an uncle.

01:11:44.885 --> 01:11:48.180
- You lock the orphans in the closet
- They love it.

01:11:48.347 --> 01:11:51.934
- You hock their Christmas souvenirs
- Drink?

01:11:52.101 --> 01:11:55.562
- You steal funds you should deposit
- It's fresh.

01:11:55.729 --> 01:12:00.609
You make them grove!
While you buy lavalieres

01:12:02.653 --> 01:12:04.071
- You'll
- Must you upset me

01:12:04.238 --> 01:12:07.366
- Sit out this century
- Why don't you pet me?

01:12:07.533 --> 01:12:09.660
It's you I crave now
Let's misbehave now

01:12:09.827 --> 01:12:12.830
- In some deep, dark
- You wanna smoochie, my little poochie

01:12:12.997 --> 01:12:16.083
Penitentiary

01:12:16.458 --> 01:12:18.002
- Jail?
- Sign!

01:12:18.168 --> 01:12:21.338
- I guess I'll never know the feeling
- You'll rot in jail

01:12:21.505 --> 01:12:23.632
Of running fingers through your hair

01:12:23.799 --> 01:12:25.175
In Sing Sing

01:12:25.342 --> 01:12:27.428
I guess this means no Buenos Aires

01:12:27.594 --> 01:12:29.596
<i>- Will you sign?
- Well, I don't need you</i>

01:12:29.763 --> 01:12:31.515
- That's fine
- So just forget me

01:12:31.682 --> 01:12:33.600
- The dotted line
- Forget my sweetness

01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:36.353
- Don't whine, you can't decline
- Forget you met me

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.063
- Today is sorta-
- Just' sign

01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:41.316
My bread and Waterloo

01:12:41.483 --> 01:12:42.985
Sign

01:12:43.152 --> 01:12:47.364
Why didn't you say so
in the first place, swine?

01:12:52.327 --> 01:12:56.790
Women! Does it take this long
to get to Tiffany's and back?

01:12:57.041 --> 01:13:00.294
- I hear the car.
- It's probably not the right car.

01:13:00.502 --> 01:13:05.299
- It's the Duesenberg.
- What took you so long?

01:13:05.507 --> 01:13:07.134
What's happening here?

01:13:07.342 --> 01:13:11.263
- Where's Annie?
- She's taking her karate lesson.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:14.725
- Don't be nervous.
- I'm not. You give it to her.

01:13:14.975 --> 01:13:18.228
- It was your idea.
- She likes you more than me.

01:13:18.479 --> 01:13:21.607
Oliver, will you pull
yourself together!

01:13:27.696 --> 01:13:31.784
Want to see what the Asp
taught me today?

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:38.248
To the couch, Punjab, if you please.

01:13:38.457 --> 01:13:42.127
- I didn't think it would work.
- Now you know it does.

01:13:42.377 --> 01:13:46.757
- Shall I call a doctor?
- It'll be fine.

01:13:55.641 --> 01:13:57.101
Thank you.

01:14:00.646 --> 01:14:02.856
We'll leave you two alone.

01:14:14.493 --> 01:14:18.372
I want to talk to you
about something very serious.

01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:23.752
- You don't want me anymore.
- On the contrary, I do.

01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:25.754
Good Lord!

01:14:27.631 --> 01:14:31.218
- Can we have a man-to-man talk?
- Sure.

01:14:31.802 --> 01:14:36.098
What I'm proposing
would involve a long-term agreement.

01:14:36.765 --> 01:14:38.100
Actually...

01:14:38.267 --> 01:14:42.271
...maybe you ought to know more about
me before you make up your mind.

01:14:42.646 --> 01:14:46.859
- Okay.
- Let's go for a walk.

01:14:49.862 --> 01:14:53.031
I was born in Liverpool.

01:14:53.615 --> 01:14:58.745
My brother died of pneumonia because
we didn't have money for medicine.

01:15:00.414 --> 01:15:05.127
I decided then and there
that one day I would be very rich.

01:15:05.377 --> 01:15:09.715
- Good idea.
- America was the land of opportunity.

01:15:09.965 --> 01:15:13.343
I signed on a ship as cabin boy
when I was 12.

01:15:13.594 --> 01:15:17.556
By the time I was 21,
I'd made my first million.

01:15:17.806 --> 01:15:21.059
In the next 10 years,
I turned that into 100 million.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.440
In those days that was a lot
of money. I was ruthless.

01:15:27.191 --> 01:15:32.321
Making money was all I ever
gave a damn about, up to now.

01:15:34.364 --> 01:15:37.534
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

01:15:40.704 --> 01:15:44.374
It has occurred to me that no matter
how many houses I have...

01:15:44.541 --> 01:15:46.001
...how many Rembrandts...

01:15:46.168 --> 01:15:52.174
...unless I have someone to share it
with, I might as well be broke.

01:15:52.341 --> 01:15:56.845
- Understand what I'm trying to say?
- Sure.

01:15:57.054 --> 01:15:58.222
Kind of.

01:15:58.430 --> 01:16:00.766
- Kind of?
- I guess not.

01:16:00.933 --> 01:16:04.061
Damn! Oh, excuse me.

01:16:12.819 --> 01:16:17.241
- You've given me so much already.
- I have the papers. It's official.

01:16:17.824 --> 01:16:19.243
What is?

01:16:23.455 --> 01:16:24.581
It's so pretty but--

01:16:24.748 --> 01:16:27.584
- Let me put it on you.
- No.

01:16:28.293 --> 01:16:33.507
It's a swell locket, but if it's
all the same, I'll keep my old one.

01:16:33.674 --> 01:16:38.053
It isn't all the same. Your old one's
broken. This one is engraved.

01:16:38.303 --> 01:16:42.891
"To Annie.
With love from Daddy Warbucks."

01:16:44.059 --> 01:16:48.355
When my folks left me
at the orphanage 10 years ago...

01:16:48.605 --> 01:16:53.694
...they left a note saying
they'd come back to get me.

01:16:53.944 --> 01:16:58.573
They kept the other half of this locket
so I'd know them when they came.

01:16:58.824 --> 01:17:02.953
I'm going to find them someday and
have a regular mother and father...

01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:07.457
...like a regular kid. I am.

01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:14.214
I don't mean to hurt your feelings.
You've been nicer to me than anyone.

01:17:15.007 --> 01:17:19.136
But I've been dreaming of my folks
for as long as I can remember.

01:17:19.386 --> 01:17:22.431
I've just got to find them.

01:17:27.686 --> 01:17:29.730
And I'll help you.

01:17:32.482 --> 01:17:37.612
Grace, get me J. Edgar on the phone!

01:17:37.863 --> 01:17:40.615
Drake, get me the chief of police!

01:17:40.866 --> 01:17:44.536
Asp, get me Walter Winchell!

01:17:44.745 --> 01:17:46.830
Punjab...

01:17:46.997 --> 01:17:50.584
...get me William Randolph Hearst!

01:17:50.751 --> 01:17:54.546
And, Saunders, get me a drink!

01:17:56.256 --> 01:17:58.717
Six, seven, eight, you're on.

01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:05.265
I-O-D-E-N-T
Iodent

01:18:05.932 --> 01:18:09.478
Hey, hobo man
Hey, dapper Dan

01:18:09.644 --> 01:18:11.563
You both got your style

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:13.190
But, brother

01:18:13.357 --> 01:18:17.235
You're never fully dressed
Without a smile

01:18:20.197 --> 01:18:23.950
Your clothes may be Beau Brummelly

01:18:24.117 --> 01:18:27.204
They stand out a mile
But, brother

01:18:27.371 --> 01:18:31.541
You're never fully dressed
Without a smile

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:34.961
The lovely Boylan Sisters.

01:18:37.339 --> 01:18:40.884
Who cares what they're wearing

01:18:41.051 --> 01:18:44.388
On Main Street or Savile Row

01:18:44.554 --> 01:18:47.849
It's what you wear from ear to ear

01:18:48.016 --> 01:18:51.895
And not from head to toe

01:18:52.062 --> 01:18:55.607
That matters

01:18:56.900 --> 01:19:02.030
Tonight as a special treat
from yours truly, Bert Healy...

01:19:02.697 --> 01:19:07.536
...I'd like to introduce
a little orphan named Annie.

01:19:16.795 --> 01:19:22.175
Who's that who just walked into
our Red Network studios?

01:19:22.342 --> 01:19:26.138
It's none other than the Wall Street
tycoon, Oliver Warbucks!

01:19:31.309 --> 01:19:36.440
"Thank you, Bert Healy.
It's swell--" Do I say swell?

01:19:36.731 --> 01:19:39.484
"Swell to be on the lodenz' Hour."

01:19:39.818 --> 01:19:43.196
I understand you're conducting
a search for Annie's parents.

01:19:43.405 --> 01:19:47.492
I told you that before we
went on the air. Oh, yes!

01:19:47.742 --> 01:19:52.372
"I am now conducting a coast-to-coast,
nationwide search...

01:19:52.581 --> 01:19:57.669
...for Annie's parents. Drop page.
Warbucks continues.

01:19:57.919 --> 01:20:04.134
I am offering a cash reward to
Annie's parents of $50,000 cash. "

01:20:04.301 --> 01:20:06.511
Oh, Mr. Warbucks!

01:20:07.262 --> 01:20:11.349
Oh, boy! 50,000 smackers.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:15.520
Annie's parents, if you're listening,
contact Oliver Warbucks--

01:20:15.729 --> 01:20:17.397
"Warbucks interrupts.

01:20:17.647 --> 01:20:24.404
At my house, 987 Fifth Avenue,
New York City.

01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:29.534
Thank you, Bert Healy,
and thank you, all-new Iodent.

01:20:29.784 --> 01:20:34.706
The toothpaste with miracle K-64
to fight hali--"

01:20:34.956 --> 01:20:38.460
- Halitosis.
-"And for letting me talk to you.

01:20:38.710 --> 01:20:43.840
Good night, Bert Healy,
for the Red Network. Drop page."

01:20:44.841 --> 01:20:49.387
Did I just do a commercial?
Let's get out of here.

01:20:49.638 --> 01:20:54.518
I've never endorsed a product
in all of my career.

01:20:56.603 --> 01:21:00.649
For all of you, our smiles family,
this is Bert Healy saying...

01:21:00.857 --> 01:21:04.611
Hey, hobo man
Hey, dapper Dan

01:21:04.778 --> 01:21:06.363
You both got your style

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:10.116
But, brother
You're never fully dressed

01:21:10.283 --> 01:21:12.244
Without a smile

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.458
Your clothes may be Beau Brummelly

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:20.085
They stand out a mile

01:21:20.252 --> 01:21:23.922
But, brother
You're never fully dressed

01:21:24.089 --> 01:21:26.132
Without a smile

01:21:31.346 --> 01:21:34.349
Who cares what they're wearing

01:21:34.516 --> 01:21:37.477
On Main Street or Savile Row

01:21:37.644 --> 01:21:41.064
It's what you wear from ear to ear

01:21:41.231 --> 01:21:45.235
And not from head to toe

01:21:45.402 --> 01:21:49.531
That matters

01:21:50.824 --> 01:21:53.076
The lovely Boylan Sisters.

01:21:53.243 --> 01:21:57.122
I-O-D-E-N-T

01:22:00.125 --> 01:22:03.545
So, senator
So, janitor

01:22:03.712 --> 01:22:05.463
So long for a while

01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:08.842
Remember you're never fully dressed

01:22:09.009 --> 01:22:11.052
Without a smile

01:22:20.645 --> 01:22:24.482
You're never fully dressed
Without a smile

01:22:33.783 --> 01:22:36.202
You're never fully dressed
Without a smile

01:22:36.369 --> 01:22:39.205
Who cares what they're wearing

01:22:39.372 --> 01:22:42.542
On Main Street or Savile Row

01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:46.212
It's what you wear from ear to ear

01:22:46.379 --> 01:22:50.091
And not from head to toe

01:22:50.592 --> 01:22:55.221
That matters

01:22:56.931 --> 01:23:00.685
So, senator
So, janitor

01:23:00.852 --> 01:23:03.480
So long for a while

01:23:03.647 --> 01:23:06.733
Remember you're never fully dressed

01:23:06.900 --> 01:23:10.320
Though you may wear the best

01:23:10.487 --> 01:23:13.365
You're never fully dressed

01:23:13.531 --> 01:23:16.701
Without a smile

01:23:16.868 --> 01:23:23.083
You're never fully dressed
You're never fully dressed

01:23:23.249 --> 01:23:24.501
Without a--

01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:28.880
Do I hear happiness in here?

01:23:42.811 --> 01:23:44.521
They never miss.

01:23:47.357 --> 01:23:49.693
Everybody's
going to get their chance.

01:23:54.155 --> 01:23:56.783
Annie, it's your mother.

01:24:01.413 --> 01:24:04.749
We've got to get her out of here.
We can't expose her to this.

01:24:04.916 --> 01:24:06.751
Get the autocopter ready.

01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:33.069
Guess what. Mr. Warbucks is going
to take you to see the president.

01:24:33.903 --> 01:24:36.197
Oh, boy!

01:24:58.470 --> 01:25:02.140
Marvelous!
Aren't Republicans ostentatious?

01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:07.061
Franklin, behave.
It's astonishing he's here at all.

01:25:11.107 --> 01:25:16.237
- What do you call this, Oliver?
- An autocopter.

01:25:16.571 --> 01:25:21.701
You don't need an airport.
They say it can land on a dime.

01:25:21.951 --> 01:25:26.748
- Whatever that may be.
- You being here means a great deal.

01:25:26.915 --> 01:25:33.338
It means nothing. It means only
that Annie wanted to meet you.

01:25:35.632 --> 01:25:40.762
- Nice to meet you, Mr. President.
- It's my pleasure, Annie.

01:25:41.137 --> 01:25:44.808
Thank you for bringing the old goat.
Make a New Dealer of him yet.

01:25:45.058 --> 01:25:48.269
- Inconceivable.
- Don't mind him, Oliver.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.104
Come along, Annie.

01:25:50.313 --> 01:25:55.443
My Uncle Theodore used to teach
his children to walk on stilts.

01:25:55.819 --> 01:25:59.656
I can't teach you that, I can teach you
to roll in a chair with wheels.

01:25:59.823 --> 01:26:01.491
My own private roller coaster.

01:26:02.325 --> 01:26:06.746
The New Deal is badly planned,
badly organized and administered.

01:26:06.996 --> 01:26:09.874
You don't think your
programs through.

01:26:10.124 --> 01:26:13.044
Think what you're going to do
to the economy!

01:26:13.253 --> 01:26:17.131
- People don't eat in the long run.
- People can't feed their children.

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:19.551
The lucky ones are left in orphanages.

01:26:19.801 --> 01:26:22.178
The older ones steal, starve.

01:26:22.387 --> 01:26:25.056
This business
of this country is business--

01:26:25.306 --> 01:26:29.602
Take them off the dole and put
them to work. That's what I'll do.

01:26:29.811 --> 01:26:35.733
In the National Parks, clearing trails,
fighting fires, planting trees.

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:38.862
- Hold it.
- I want to feed them and house them...

01:26:39.028 --> 01:26:40.071
...and pay them.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.365
Enough to send home
to their parents...

01:26:42.532 --> 01:26:46.619
...so they can hold their heads up
and be proud to be Americans.

01:26:46.786 --> 01:26:50.039
- That's a swell idea.
- It isn't a swell idea, Annie...

01:26:50.206 --> 01:26:52.000
...it's mistaken foolishness.

01:26:52.166 --> 01:26:54.377
Big-hearted and empty-headed.

01:26:54.586 --> 01:26:58.464
Which parks? Which children?
What will it cost?

01:26:58.715 --> 01:27:01.467
Who's going to organize it?
Who's going to run it?

01:27:02.677 --> 01:27:06.389
- I was hoping you would.
- Me?

01:27:06.598 --> 01:27:10.435
- And Annie.
- Leaping lizards!

01:27:10.935 --> 01:27:13.897
- Out of the question.
- How can I help?

01:27:14.147 --> 01:27:15.523
Wait a minute!

01:27:15.732 --> 01:27:18.693
- You can help recruit young people.
- Hold everything!

01:27:18.943 --> 01:27:23.156
They think their government
doesn't care whether they live or die.

01:27:23.406 --> 01:27:26.492
With your help,
we could convince them otherwise-

01:27:26.743 --> 01:27:28.286
I want to say something.

01:27:28.536 --> 01:27:33.082
There's a song I used to sing
in the orphanage when I was sad.

01:27:33.333 --> 01:27:36.878
- It always cheered me up.
- Eleanor!

01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:41.925
Just thinking about tomorrow

01:27:42.091 --> 01:27:47.138
Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow

01:27:47.305 --> 01:27:49.807
Till there's none

01:27:49.974 --> 01:27:52.310
When I'm stuck with a day

01:27:52.477 --> 01:27:56.189
That's gray and lonely

01:27:56.356 --> 01:27:58.650
I just stick out my chin

01:27:58.816 --> 01:28:03.821
And grin and say

01:28:06.449 --> 01:28:09.702
<i>The sun 'll come out tomorrow</i>

01:28:09.869 --> 01:28:14.540
<i>So you gotta hang on till tomorrow</i>

01:28:14.707 --> 01:28:18.044
Come what may

01:28:18.211 --> 01:28:21.047
Tomorrow, tomorrow

01:28:21.214 --> 01:28:24.175
I love ya, tomorrow

01:28:24.342 --> 01:28:29.305
You're only a day away

01:28:32.183 --> 01:28:34.936
Oh, Franklin.

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:40.400
You'll help us too, won't you, Oliver?

01:28:40.817 --> 01:28:43.236
Think of the children.
Think of Annie.

01:28:45.029 --> 01:28:47.949
<i>The sun 'll come out tomorrow</i>

01:28:48.116 --> 01:28:52.328
Sing, Oliver, that's an order
from your commander in chief.

01:28:52.996 --> 01:28:55.289
There 'll be sun

01:28:55.456 --> 01:28:56.666
- Eleanor?
- I can't sing.

01:28:56.874 --> 01:28:58.251
Sing.

01:28:59.585 --> 01:29:03.840
Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow

01:29:04.007 --> 01:29:05.049
Till there's none

01:29:05.216 --> 01:29:06.551
Solo for the president.

01:29:06.718 --> 01:29:08.720
When I'm stuck with a day

01:29:08.886 --> 01:29:11.180
That's gray and lonely

01:29:11.764 --> 01:29:13.975
I just stick out my chin

01:29:14.142 --> 01:29:17.020
And grin and say

01:29:17.186 --> 01:29:20.523
Everybody! Republicans too, Oliver.
Sing!

01:29:20.898 --> 01:29:24.068
<i>The sun 'll come out tomorrow</i>

01:29:24.235 --> 01:29:28.322
So you've got to hang on till tomorrow

01:29:28.489 --> 01:29:30.408
Come what may

01:29:30.575 --> 01:29:31.617
Harmony!

01:29:31.784 --> 01:29:34.120
Tomorrow, tomorrow

01:29:34.287 --> 01:29:36.831
I love ya, tomorrow

01:29:36.998 --> 01:29:41.252
You're only a day away

01:29:41.419 --> 01:29:44.964
Tomorrow, tomorrow

01:29:45.131 --> 01:29:47.800
I love ya, tomorrow

01:29:47.967 --> 01:29:52.096
You're only a day

01:29:52.263 --> 01:29:59.062
A Way

01:30:03.274 --> 01:30:08.404
All right, everybody, step up.
I've got fresh fish here.

01:30:21.042 --> 01:30:25.505
- Do you run this establishment?
- Unfortunately.

01:30:25.713 --> 01:30:30.218
Ten years ago, we left our
little baby girl on the front steps.

01:30:30.468 --> 01:30:36.140
There was a job managing a hotel,
but only if we had no children.

01:30:36.349 --> 01:30:41.229
- Wrap it up.
- We never meant to leave Annie.

01:30:42.939 --> 01:30:46.776
Now we have a hardware store in
New Jersey. We can take care of her.

01:30:47.026 --> 01:30:48.528
We've always loved her.

01:30:49.862 --> 01:30:54.826
- You're Annie's parents?
- We live over the store.

01:30:55.618 --> 01:30:58.496
- There's a yard out back.
- With chickens.

01:30:58.746 --> 01:31:00.748
And a rooster.

01:31:05.503 --> 01:31:07.004
Rooster?

01:31:10.716 --> 01:31:15.346
My God! I never would
have recognized you.

01:31:19.934 --> 01:31:23.688
If we can fool you,
we can fool "Big Bucks."

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:27.859
- Fifty thousand smackers.
- You'll be the death of me.

01:31:28.067 --> 01:31:32.697
Sis, this is going to be
the best bunco job ever.

01:31:32.947 --> 01:31:38.077
- We need details.
- About Annie. Specifics.

01:31:38.703 --> 01:31:43.416
- What's in it for me'?
- A three-way split of the $50,000.

01:31:43.666 --> 01:31:46.210
- I want half.
- All right, half!

01:31:46.377 --> 01:31:48.713
- Rooster!
- All right!

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.718
Twenty-five grand for me and Lil,
25 grand for you.

01:31:56.512 --> 01:31:59.765
Why don't we wait
and see what she's got.

01:32:00.433 --> 01:32:03.936
See if it's worth 25 grand.

01:32:04.187 --> 01:32:07.398
You want details? I've got details.

01:32:07.565 --> 01:32:10.193
I've got specifics on every kid
in this dump.

01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:13.196
It's just finding the right box.

01:32:15.448 --> 01:32:19.577
Annie wears a locket around her neck.

01:32:20.453 --> 01:32:22.496
It's a broken locket.

01:32:22.705 --> 01:32:27.710
She says her parents saved the other
half to come and claim her with.

01:32:28.169 --> 01:32:33.007
Years ago,
her parents were killed in a fire.

01:32:33.633 --> 01:32:35.718
The cops brought me all their junk.

01:32:35.927 --> 01:32:38.137
Well, my darling baby brother...

01:32:38.304 --> 01:32:42.975
...if Annie's parents can claim her
with that locket, so can we.

01:32:43.768 --> 01:32:48.189
- Fifty thousand smackers.
- The kid we'll drop in the river.

01:32:48.439 --> 01:32:52.026
They're going to do
something bad to Annie!

01:32:52.235 --> 01:32:55.238
- Have you cleaned the can?
- Listen to me. I mean it.

01:32:55.446 --> 01:32:56.822
Clean the can!

01:32:57.031 --> 01:33:01.535
- Duffy, Tessie, somebody!
- Do you want a knuckle sandwich?

01:33:01.786 --> 01:33:04.205
- We've got to warn Annie!
- Scrub!

01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:07.875
It's in a sealed envelope.

01:33:08.042 --> 01:33:11.587
It ain't fair how we scrounge
For three or four bucks

01:33:11.754 --> 01:33:13.089
While she gets Warbucks

01:33:13.256 --> 01:33:15.508
The little brat. Look in those!

01:33:15.675 --> 01:33:18.636
It ain't fair
This here life is driving me nuts

01:33:18.803 --> 01:33:20.054
Make yourself useful!

01:33:20.221 --> 01:33:22.139
When we get peanuts

01:33:22.974 --> 01:33:24.392
She's living fat

01:33:24.809 --> 01:33:26.644
Maybe she holds the key

01:33:26.811 --> 01:33:29.438
- That little lady
- To getting more bucks

01:33:29.605 --> 01:33:32.483
- Right, instead of less.
- It'll have her name on it.

01:33:32.650 --> 01:33:37.655
Maybe we fix it again
With something shady

01:33:37.822 --> 01:33:40.866
Where does that put us?

01:33:44.578 --> 01:33:46.497
Give you one guess

01:33:50.835 --> 01:33:51.961
Open it.

01:33:55.298 --> 01:33:57.550
Hurry.

01:34:00.094 --> 01:34:02.138
Easy Street

01:34:04.515 --> 01:34:07.935
Easy Street

01:34:08.227 --> 01:34:14.817
- Annie is the key
- Yes, sirree

01:34:16.986 --> 01:34:20.239
<i>- Easy Street
- We'll live the plush life</i>

01:34:20.406 --> 01:34:23.784
- Easy Street
- The lazy, lush life

01:34:23.951 --> 01:34:27.330
Better get there

01:34:29.874 --> 01:34:31.917
The gravy's flowing there

01:34:33.836 --> 01:34:35.963
We'll soon be going there

01:34:36.130 --> 01:34:40.259
Where you sleep till noon

01:34:40.426 --> 01:34:42.303
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:34:44.513 --> 01:34:48.517
- Move them feet
- Move them ever-loving feet

01:34:48.684 --> 01:34:52.063
- To Easy Street
- Where living's sweet

01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:56.067
That's where we're gonna be

01:34:57.610 --> 01:35:00.571
Easy Street

01:35:01.655 --> 01:35:04.408
Easy Street

01:36:15.646 --> 01:36:20.192
Move them feet to Easy Street

01:36:21.235 --> 01:36:31.829
That's where we're gonna

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.469
Hit it, sis.

01:36:56.395 --> 01:37:01.442
That's where we're gonna

01:37:01.609 --> 01:37:03.819
Stay

01:37:08.699 --> 01:37:13.204
Easy Street

01:37:22.963 --> 01:37:25.341
Now do the other one.

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:38.479
Duffy, Tessie, somebody! They're
going to do something to Annie!

01:37:38.687 --> 01:37:40.397
- Who is?
- They are!

01:37:40.648 --> 01:37:42.441
- Who's they?
- Miss Hannigan.

01:37:42.691 --> 01:37:44.318
Oh, my goodness!

01:37:48.822 --> 01:37:50.783
Beautiful.

01:37:57.456 --> 01:38:01.627
- Where do you think you're going?
- Run, run, go tell Annie!

01:38:02.753 --> 01:38:04.338
Stop them.

01:38:13.264 --> 01:38:14.974
Get in that closet.

01:38:16.559 --> 01:38:18.727
Stop it!

01:38:23.816 --> 01:38:27.069
Whose rotten idea was this?

01:39:02.187 --> 01:39:04.189
Are they here?

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:08.402
A man who counts his chickens before
they hatch gets a scrambled egg.

01:39:08.569 --> 01:39:10.195
What?

01:39:14.033 --> 01:39:19.330
- Have my parents come for me?
- We haven't found them.

01:39:45.481 --> 01:39:50.611
I interviewed 865 couples.
None of them knew about the locket.

01:39:51.904 --> 01:39:55.908
I never realized how many dishonest
people there are in New York.

01:40:17.388 --> 01:40:23.060
They're dead. I guess I've known
that deep down for a long time.

01:40:23.227 --> 01:40:26.355
I'm not giving up, so don't you.

01:40:26.522 --> 01:40:31.151
I didn't want to be just another
orphan. I wanted to be special.

01:40:31.402 --> 01:40:35.948
You are special.
Never stop believing that.

01:40:36.782 --> 01:40:39.076
We're trapped.

01:40:44.289 --> 01:40:47.626
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

01:40:48.961 --> 01:40:52.423
- We'll never get out of here.
- I've got an idea.

01:40:54.258 --> 01:40:57.845
Great idea.

01:40:58.971 --> 01:41:01.807
- It's heavy.
- Don't drop it.

01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:08.897
- All right.
- Now what do you want to do?

01:41:11.108 --> 01:41:15.028
She'll be so mad if she catches us.

01:41:15.195 --> 01:41:19.575
I'm not so sure I want to do this.
We'll be in so much trouble.

01:41:19.825 --> 01:41:23.495
- Duffy, hand me something.
- Here.

01:41:32.045 --> 01:41:35.340
- There's space up here.
- Be careful.

01:41:36.049 --> 01:41:39.762
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

01:41:40.012 --> 01:41:42.055
Help me get UP-

01:41:51.607 --> 01:41:53.901
Give me your hand.

01:41:57.279 --> 01:42:00.824
It's a long way down.
Are you sure you want to do this?

01:42:05.162 --> 01:42:07.498
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

01:42:26.892 --> 01:42:32.523
We were starving. We needed the job
That's why we left our little girl.

01:42:32.689 --> 01:42:39.446
- Wrapped in a newspaper.
- On the steps of the orphanage.

01:42:47.579 --> 01:42:48.789
What's this?

01:42:49.039 --> 01:42:52.334
This is Ralph and Shirley Mudge
from Hoboken, New Jersey.

01:42:52.501 --> 01:42:53.794
Annie!

01:42:58.048 --> 01:43:03.178
Ralph, look!
She still has the locket.

01:43:17.901 --> 01:43:20.028
We finally found you.

01:43:20.279 --> 01:43:22.823
You heard about the reward
on the radio.

01:43:23.073 --> 01:43:25.534
- Reward?
- We don't have a radio.

01:43:25.784 --> 01:43:27.411
- In the paper.
- Paper?

01:43:27.661 --> 01:43:30.706
- What paper?
- How did you know Annie was here?

01:43:30.956 --> 01:43:35.669
- The lady at the orphanage told us.
- I have her birth certificate here.

01:43:37.337 --> 01:43:42.426
I've kept it close to my heart
all of these years.

01:43:46.805 --> 01:43:48.765
"Ann Marie Mudge.

01:43:49.016 --> 01:43:54.146
October 18, 1922."

01:44:00.068 --> 01:44:01.987
I'll go pack.

01:44:04.531 --> 01:44:07.618
Do you want me to help, baby?

01:44:08.952 --> 01:44:10.621
No, thanks...

01:44:11.371 --> 01:44:13.040
...Mom.

01:44:42.861 --> 01:44:44.613
Come on.

01:45:02.255 --> 01:45:04.549
A certified check!

01:45:05.592 --> 01:45:09.972
We're so glad to have found Annie.
We don't need this.

01:45:10.222 --> 01:45:16.103
- I'll take it back.
- Of course, we are poor people.

01:45:17.145 --> 01:45:19.398
It would help us a lot.

01:45:19.648 --> 01:45:24.611
We could buy her milk,
a warm blanket.

01:45:26.363 --> 01:45:31.243
Put it in your pocket, Mrs. Mudge.

01:45:36.123 --> 01:45:38.125
Come on, you guys.

01:45:40.085 --> 01:45:45.215
- Oh, my goodness!
- We're never going to make it.

01:45:45.465 --> 01:45:49.803
- We've found Fifth Avenue.
- Number one, Fifth Avenue.

01:45:50.012 --> 01:45:53.348
We've got to go to 987.

01:45:54.266 --> 01:45:58.145
- Molly, get on my back.
- Come on, you guys, help.

01:46:02.274 --> 01:46:07.112
- Will the stores take this back?
- All your new clothes?

01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:10.907
I guess so.
Don't you want to keep them?

01:46:11.158 --> 01:46:16.288
My folks are poor. All these clothes
are going to make them feel bad.

01:46:16.496 --> 01:46:22.377
- Take them to the orphanage.
- Certainly.

01:46:22.753 --> 01:46:25.464
This will look so cute on Molly.

01:46:28.008 --> 01:46:30.469
This will look good on Duffy.

01:46:44.024 --> 01:46:48.278
Betcha my life
Is gonna be swell

01:46:48.445 --> 01:46:49.905
Looking at them

01:46:50.072 --> 01:46:54.076
It's easy to tell

01:46:54.451 --> 01:46:58.371
And maybe I'll forget

01:46:58.538 --> 01:47:02.292
How nice he was to me

01:47:03.168 --> 01:47:09.549
And how I was almost his baby

01:47:32.489 --> 01:47:34.491
It'll be fine

01:47:34.658 --> 01:47:36.576
Nothing to fear

01:47:36.743 --> 01:47:40.455
She'll be as happy
As she was here

01:47:40.622 --> 01:47:44.126
Things have worked out
Much better than planned

01:47:44.292 --> 01:47:46.128
It makes you smile

01:47:46.294 --> 01:47:49.214
When fate takes a hand

01:47:51.550 --> 01:47:54.386
<i>And I know I'll forget</i>

01:47:54.553 --> 01:47:57.889
How much she meant to me

01:47:58.056 --> 01:48:04.187
And how she was almost my baby

01:48:05.230 --> 01:48:08.150
Maybe

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.512
- Did you get it?
- She has it.

01:48:37.679 --> 01:48:39.347
Let me see it.

01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:45.270
- I'd better keep it.
- Over my dead body.

01:48:45.478 --> 01:48:48.398
That's the brightest thing I've
ever heard you say.

01:48:48.565 --> 01:48:50.066
Ladies! Ladies!

01:48:50.233 --> 01:48:54.112
- Help, Mr. Warbucks! Help!
- Get on the road!

01:48:58.325 --> 01:49:01.077
We'll never find the house.

01:49:01.244 --> 01:49:04.998
I wish I'd been outside New York City.

01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:09.586
When I get my half!

01:49:14.674 --> 01:49:16.927
- I say we go back.
- We can't.

01:49:17.177 --> 01:49:19.221
We've been walking for 100 years!

01:49:19.471 --> 01:49:23.475
- We're never going to get there.
- But we have to.

01:49:23.725 --> 01:49:28.813
- Let's take a vote.
- All in favor of calling it quits?

01:49:31.316 --> 01:49:35.654
- I'll get a gold lamÃ© number.
- In Atlantic City.

01:49:35.904 --> 01:49:40.242
We aren't stopping
till we hit Atlantic City.

01:49:43.662 --> 01:49:47.749
- Help, Mr. Warbucks!
- Shut up, kid.

01:49:51.044 --> 01:49:54.005
Look, there's Sandy!

01:49:57.133 --> 01:49:59.761
Come here! Come here!

01:50:07.769 --> 01:50:10.689
Come on, let's go!

01:50:11.898 --> 01:50:14.234
- Hurry up_
- Hurry! Hurry!

01:50:17.195 --> 01:50:20.073
I can't run anymore.

01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:34.879
Quiet down, girls.

01:50:35.463 --> 01:50:39.676
You want to see Mr. Warbucks?
All right, come on.

01:51:10.915 --> 01:51:13.043
Oh, my goodness!

01:51:36.358 --> 01:51:39.361
- What now?
- Sir.

01:51:39.611 --> 01:51:42.572
- I think he's a highness.
- Your Highness.

01:51:42.822 --> 01:51:46.201
- We're friends of Annie's.
- Annie's gone.

01:51:46.451 --> 01:51:50.997
- Her parents took her away.
- But they wasn't her parents.

01:51:51.247 --> 01:51:55.585
- They was bad people.
- Leaping lizards!

01:52:00.048 --> 01:52:02.675
You take the autocopter,
I'll take the car.

01:52:02.884 --> 01:52:07.889
J. Edgar? Warbucks here.
Orphan Annie has been kidnapped.

01:52:08.098 --> 01:52:11.976
I want every G-man on this
in the next 20 minutes.

01:52:14.729 --> 01:52:17.065
Where's the fire, fellas?

01:53:23.214 --> 01:53:26.676
The truck is on Canal Street,
heading east.

01:53:27.051 --> 01:53:31.264
East on Canal.
Well done, Punjab. Don't lose them.

01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:39.439
Can we stop? I've got to go.

01:53:41.566 --> 01:53:44.027
I've really got to, Miss Hannigan.

01:53:45.904 --> 01:53:50.783
I mean it. When you've got to go,
you've got to go.

01:53:59.501 --> 01:54:01.544
Make it fast.

01:54:05.256 --> 01:54:08.218
Rooster, grab her!
She's got the check!

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:16.809
- Cut her off at the bridge.
- Goddamn it!

01:54:17.685 --> 01:54:20.104
Come back here, you goddamn kid!

01:54:42.710 --> 01:54:45.129
Mr. Warbucks will eat your livers.

01:54:45.338 --> 01:54:50.468
- I'll kill you.
- He's really going to kill her.

01:54:51.886 --> 01:54:56.975
Rooster! Rooster, stop!

01:54:58.268 --> 01:55:01.145
Rooster, she's a baby.

01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:05.024
Come back here.

01:55:10.572 --> 01:55:11.614
Rooster!

01:55:11.781 --> 01:55:15.118
- I'm gonna kill her!
- No, I'm not gonna let you!

01:55:15.285 --> 01:55:17.870
She may be a mean,
rotten, little orphan...

01:55:18.079 --> 01:55:22.166
-...but I'm not going to let you kill her.
- Let go of me, you boozer!

01:55:22.333 --> 01:55:24.335
Stop it!

01:56:11.424 --> 01:56:15.053
- They're at the bridge.
- Turn right.

01:56:15.303 --> 01:56:17.430
I know.

01:57:47.770 --> 01:57:52.525
Help, somebody! Help! Help!
Help, somebody!

01:57:53.192 --> 01:57:58.030
Leave me alone. Please help!
Please help!

01:58:02.118 --> 01:58:05.121
Let's go, get the ladders in there!

01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:19.844
Somebody help me!

01:58:23.181 --> 01:58:26.392
Come on, over here!
Hurry it up there!

01:58:27.435 --> 01:58:28.728
Bring it up this way!

01:58:31.063 --> 01:58:33.357
Help!

01:58:33.524 --> 01:58:35.359
Have we got two nets?

01:58:38.237 --> 01:58:42.116
Hurry up! You're too slow! Let's go!

01:58:42.283 --> 01:58:46.204
Please, Punjab, help me.

01:58:46.370 --> 01:58:48.790
Help me, Punjab! Help!

01:58:50.458 --> 01:58:52.460
Punjab, help.

01:58:54.879 --> 01:58:59.759
- You must hold on.
- I can't.

01:59:00.676 --> 01:59:07.058
Buddha says a child without courage
is like a night without stars. Come.

01:59:08.935 --> 01:59:10.228
Back it in here.

01:59:17.068 --> 01:59:19.946
Rooster, you reprobate.

01:59:25.284 --> 01:59:27.537
Okay, let's clear the area over here!

02:00:17.211 --> 02:00:20.047
Together at last

02:00:20.214 --> 02:00:22.800
Together forever

02:00:22.967 --> 02:00:24.844
We're tying a knot

02:00:25.803 --> 02:00:27.805
They never can sever

02:00:28.681 --> 02:00:31.058
I don't need sunshine now

02:00:31.225 --> 02:00:34.145
To turn my skies to blue

02:00:34.312 --> 02:00:38.316
I don't need anything but you

02:00:49.535 --> 02:00:51.996
You've wrapped me around

02:00:52.496 --> 02:00:55.249
That cute little finger

02:00:55.416 --> 02:00:57.335
You've made life a song

02:00:58.044 --> 02:01:00.755
You've made me the singer

02:01:00.922 --> 02:01:05.593
And what's that bathtub tune
You always

02:01:13.559 --> 02:01:16.646
Yesterday was plain awful

02:01:16.812 --> 02:01:19.148
You can say that again

02:01:19.315 --> 02:01:22.109
Yesterday was plain awful

02:01:22.276 --> 02:01:24.111
- But that's
- Not now

02:01:24.278 --> 02:01:26.197
That's then

02:01:42.463 --> 02:01:44.465
I'm poor as a mouse

02:01:45.675 --> 02:01:47.802
I'm richer than Midas

02:01:47.969 --> 02:01:50.137
- Oliver, marvelous!
- But nothing on earth

02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:53.766
Could ever divide us

02:01:53.933 --> 02:01:59.438
And if tomorrow I'm an apple seller too

02:01:59.605 --> 02:02:01.774
I don't need anything

02:02:01.941 --> 02:02:04.652
Anything, anything

02:02:04.819 --> 02:02:08.614
I don't need anything but

02:02:13.452 --> 02:02:15.955
She's like the fizz in a Coke

02:02:16.122 --> 02:02:19.625
A buck when you're broke
And more

02:02:19.792 --> 02:02:22.461
When woes and worries take hold

02:02:22.628 --> 02:02:26.382
Who gives them the old trap door

02:02:26.549 --> 02:02:29.301
I do not mind repeating
We got Annie

02:02:29.468 --> 02:02:31.637
That 4th of July kid!

02:02:31.804 --> 02:02:35.725
We got Annie
I wish she were my kid

02:02:35.891 --> 02:02:38.060
We got Annie

02:02:38.227 --> 02:02:40.771
And she's got it all

02:02:53.159 --> 02:02:54.660
Annie!

02:03:04.795 --> 02:03:07.965
"To Annie. With love."

02:03:08.132 --> 02:03:11.802
I love you, Daddy Warbucks.

02:03:11.969 --> 02:03:14.847
Tomorrow, tomorrow

02:03:15.014 --> 02:03:18.017
I love ya, tomorrow

02:03:18.184 --> 02:03:22.646
You're only a day away

02:03:29.653 --> 02:03:33.032
Tomorrow, tomorrow

02:03:33.199 --> 02:03:36.118
I love ya, tomorrow

02:03:36.285 --> 02:03:40.790
You're only a day

02:03:40.956 --> 02:03:47.505
A Way

02:04:05.314 --> 02:04:08.776
<i>The sun 'll come out tomorrow</i>

02:04:08.943 --> 02:04:13.447
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow

02:04:13.614 --> 02:04:16.784
There 'll be sun

02:04:16.951 --> 02:04:20.454
Just thinking about tomorrow

02:04:20.621 --> 02:04:25.251
Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow

02:04:25.417 --> 02:04:27.878
Till there's none

02:04:28.045 --> 02:04:33.425
When I'm stuck with a day
That's gray and lonely

02:04:33.592 --> 02:04:35.553
I just stick out my chin

02:04:35.719 --> 02:04:40.724
And grin and say

02:04:40.891 --> 02:04:46.689
Oh, the sun 'II come out tomorrow

02:04:46.856 --> 02:04:51.527
<i>So you gotta hang on till tomorrow</i>

02:04:51.694 --> 02:04:54.613
Come what may

02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:57.700
Tomorrow, tomorrow

02:04:57.867 --> 02:05:00.536
I love ya, tomorrow

02:05:00.703 --> 02:05:05.207
You're only a day away

02:05:05.374 --> 02:05:09.587
Tomorrow, tomorrow

02:05:09.753 --> 02:05:12.631
I love ya, tomorrow

02:05:12.798 --> 02:05:17.636
You're only a day

02:05:17.803 --> 02:05:24.310
Away
