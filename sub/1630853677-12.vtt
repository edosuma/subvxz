My 12:30 is here.

- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.071
Ohh.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.117
This chair feels lower.
Or maybe you got taller.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.786
Ah.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.330
So what brings you in today?

00:38.330 --> 00:40.040
I'm thinking of retiring.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.751
And I want to know if the time is right.

00:42.751 --> 00:43.669
Great.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.588
- Let's explore that.
- Okay.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.802
You alright?

00:52.761 --> 00:55.097
You look like me watching my adult son

00:55.097 --> 00:56.765
ride his unicycle.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.017
- You know what?
Let me try holding your planner.

00:59.017 --> 01:02.062
- Alright. But, uh, the woman
I drew in there is not you.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.522
- I hope not.
- No.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.989
I'm just confirming here.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.533
Should Zach retire?

01:15.450 --> 01:17.411
Ask again later? Huh.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.746
- Maybe I'm not the one
that's supposed to retire.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.375
- You know what? I'm not going
to charge you for today.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.919
How about you, uh, come back
next week and we try again?

01:25.919 --> 01:28.005
- Maggie, you know what happens
to a racehorse

01:28.005 --> 01:29.047
that breaks their leg?

01:29.047 --> 01:31.842
- Yes. They get better

01:46.064 --> 01:48.692
Honey, I wasn't worried at first,

01:48.692 --> 01:50.611
but your visions have been gone a while.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.487
How are you going to keep seeing clients?

01:52.487 --> 01:53.989
Well, I'm trying new things at work,

01:53.989 --> 01:55.991
like I'm asking everyone to reschedule,

01:55.991 --> 01:58.327
which is a really interesting way
to stop making money.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.245
I did make this, though.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.679
you are clearly grieving
your lost visions.

The Spice Girls of emotion.

Baby is denial.

Angel, I am not grieving my visions

02:27.564 --> 02:29.399
because I'm going to get them back.

Oh, that's Baby Spice talking.

No. You know what?

spiritual guidance for one day.

02:45.958 --> 02:48.085
Oh, anger. That's good.

You're moving on to the next stage.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.129
Sporty Spice.

03:04.768 --> 03:08.272
Do we go with the parsnip-wrapped
devils on horseback

03:08.272 --> 03:11.859
or the savory mushroom
and parmesan-crusted palmiers?

03:12.276 --> 03:13.068
Mm.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.612

03:15.612 --> 03:18.407
- Well, I wish I could tell you
if these were going to taste good,

03:18.407 --> 03:21.535
but without my visions,
there's simply no way to know.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.663
Or you could just taste them.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.748
- It's kind of what we're doing here.
- Oh.

03:29.835 --> 03:30.961
Well?

03:30.961 --> 03:32.880
- Well, I can't do it
with you looking at me.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.551
- Is she going to be
like this at the wedding?

03:37.551 --> 03:39.845
Oh, she'll be fine. I'll handle it.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.514
- Great. So Louise is on Maggie duty...

03:42.514 --> 03:44.933
and Maggie is working on herself.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.020
Amy, you can't keep
giving people jobs.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.022
This isn't like when we were younger
and we played Pharaohs,

03:50.022 --> 03:51.481
and only you got to be the pharaoh.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.692
That's exactly what this is, Ben.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.569
And you need to work
on your speech for the reception.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.488
You have to write a speech.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.615
So do you

03:59.615 --> 04:00.824
as my maid of honor.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.576
Wait, what?

04:02.576 --> 04:04.745
I'm not the maid of honor.
I'm just a bridesmaid.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.706
- Oh, well, unfortunately,
Mindy and I got into a huge fight

04:07.706 --> 04:09.416
because I said no kids
were allowed at the wedding,

04:09.416 --> 04:10.542
but pets are welcome.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.960
So you got promoted.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.711
Yay!

04:12.711 --> 04:15.214
Please just make sure
it's 250 words minimum

04:15.214 --> 04:16.590
and no metaphors.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.799
I don't understand them.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.635
- I wish I had seen this coming.
- Yeah.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.053
That was a dig, right?

04:22.638 --> 04:23.680
Good luck with her.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.488
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.618
- I can't believe your sister's
making me write this speech.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.537
I suck at public speaking.

04:46.537 --> 04:49.498
The last time I stood at a podium,
I introduced myself as Allison.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.084
- Hey, that was the biggest laugh
at my dad's funeral.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.418
It's going to be a disaster.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.003
I'm already sweating through my bra.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.880
Look, it's going to be fine. Okay?

04:57.422 --> 04:59.007
Your hair videos get a ton of views.

04:59.007 --> 05:02.052
Didn't Doja Cat stitch
one of your fishtail tutorials on Hairtok?

05:02.052 --> 05:03.804
Huh. You do listen.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.472
But that was prerecorded.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.391
I wish I could film myself ahead of time.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.600
You can if you want.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.771
Stay with me on this.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.815
Why don't you read one
of Shakespeare's sonnets

05:14.815 --> 05:16.984
but, like, in a hip-hop way?

05:17.401 --> 05:19.611
- Wow. You really are
a high school teacher.

05:20.112 --> 05:20.988
Okay.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.823
Less problematic,

05:22.823 --> 05:25.367
you can interview Amy and Dave's friends,

05:25.367 --> 05:26.994
like in <i>When Harry Met Sally.</i>

05:26.994 --> 05:28.453
Having those couples talk about love.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.705
I don't really get that movie.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.707
It shouldn't take ten years
to know you like someone.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.083
Well, well, well,

05:33.083 --> 05:34.960
not everyone can meet their person

05:34.960 --> 05:37.880
under a giant rainbow parachute
in gym class.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.340
Oh.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.719
Yeah. Yeah, maybe that works.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.262
You know, I can ask everyone else

05:45.262 --> 05:47.264
the questions I'm having trouble
answering myself.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.808
How do you know if someone is the one?

05:51.560 --> 05:54.021
Having trouble answering this?
Should I be worried?

05:54.021 --> 05:56.940
- Come on, we don't count.
We've been together forever.

05:56.940 --> 05:57.816
Hmm.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.068
You know, like in a hot way.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.780

dismissive to me. I like that.

06:11.413 --> 06:14.458
- Hi.
- Hey there, Miss Sexy Notebook Lady.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.461

through our vows together.

06:17.461 --> 06:18.879
- Before the wedding?
- Uh-huh.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.424
- Isn't that bad luck? Like breaking
a mirror or watching an evil videotape?

06:22.424 --> 06:24.843
- Well, I just think
that we need to be prepared.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.012

with that right out of the gate?

06:47.199 --> 06:48.325
Who is that? Maya Angelou?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.619
I know. This is never going to work.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.247
I spent $1,200 on a makeup artist.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.123
Oh, you went with the cheaper option.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.625
I appreciate that, babe.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.253
- I know we had a plan
to be romantic with our vows,

06:59.253 --> 07:00.712
but I think that we just need to write

07:00.712 --> 07:03.215
the driest version of our vows possible

07:03.215 --> 07:04.842
so we can just blow through them.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.802
For you, I can do that. Yeah.

07:07.511 --> 07:11.139
As long as I have you by my side,
I can do anything.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.642

- Oh my god, stop.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.522
- How many candles
and crystals do you need?

07:18.522 --> 07:21.108
- As many as it takes
to get my visions back.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.443
- I'm not really sure how
a yoni egg is supposed to help.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.654
- Look, Lou, I have
a very targeted approach.

07:25.654 --> 07:28.866
And that approach is
to try absolutely everything.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.659
- Mm-hmm.
- Except maybe ayahuasca.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.578
- Well, honestly,
if you're looking for visions,

07:32.578 --> 07:34.538
ayahuasca is probably your best bet.

07:34.538 --> 07:35.789
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.335
Add event to my calendar. Do ayahuasca.

07:40.335 --> 07:43.213
- Okay, Maggie, I'm starting to get
a little worried about you.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.798
You're acting desperate, okay,

07:44.798 --> 07:47.092
and people take advantage of desperation.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.761
That's why you never shop
at a store with a hot salesperson.

07:50.429 --> 07:53.849
- Okay, Lou, I don't think I'm in danger
of being manipulated.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.184
Okay?

07:55.184 --> 07:58.145
Smoothies for complete spiritual rebirth.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.855
Only $18.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.442
It's a waste of money, girl.

08:05.319 --> 08:08.322
Oh, that pet store
has crème brulée for dogs!

08:08.322 --> 08:10.532
Let's get one, Thelma.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.075
WOMAN:
Did you want to add a scoop

08:12.075 --> 08:14.578
of yellowjacket pollen or deep-sea fungus?

08:14.578 --> 08:16.246
DANIEL:
Which is better for getting in shape

08:16.246 --> 08:18.081
without having to move your body?

08:18.081 --> 08:19.750
- Neither.
Okay.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.460
Well, that will be $40.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.920
Top swipe right here.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.213
I will be right with you.

08:24.713 --> 08:25.797
Be right up.

08:26.924 --> 08:27.925
Maggie?

08:29.134 --> 08:30.427
-Daniel.
- Hi.

08:30.427 --> 08:31.887
- Hi.
Wow.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.222
This is a surprise.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.265
You have no idea.

08:42.814 --> 08:46.610
- Well, I never thought
I would see you in a place like this.

08:46.610 --> 08:47.819
Yeah. Yeah.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.739
Well, um, these days, I'm, uh,

08:50.739 --> 08:53.951
I'm trying to glow from the inside out.

08:53.951 --> 08:57.120
- Large chocolate maca reishi,
no maca, no reishi, extra chocolate?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.207
- That yours?
- Uh, no.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.125
For Daniel?

09:02.668 --> 09:03.126
Yes.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.046
Yes. Thank you.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.130
Ha, ha!

09:08.173 --> 09:09.383
It's really good to see you.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.677
Good to see you, too.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.053
I hope it's okay for me to say this,

09:13.053 --> 09:15.305
it's probably not,
but I'm going to say it anyway.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.141
I picked up my phone
a million times to call you.

09:18.141 --> 09:21.103
I just... I just, I just didn't think
that you'd answer it.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.729
Probably wouldn't have.

09:22.729 --> 09:23.856
Yeah.

09:23.856 --> 09:28.318
- Uh, but I think I might be
in a different place now.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.906
- Yeah, me too.
I mean, I'm in a wellness store.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.117
- Sir, your large cup
of whipped cream to go.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.662
Thank you. Thanks.

09:38.662 --> 09:41.248
I took the liberty of ordering you

09:41.248 --> 09:43.458
a large cup of whipped cream.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.505
So, kind of exciting news.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.299
I'm seeing Daniel tomorrow.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.261
- That had better be a play
where Harry Potter gets naked.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.429
Think about it, Angel.

09:55.429 --> 09:59.433
Maybe I lost my visions
because I'm supposed to be with him.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.852
And we're into the bargaining stage.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.896
We broke up because of my visions,

10:03.896 --> 10:06.607
and now he shows up
when I don't have them anymore?

10:07.482 --> 10:09.318
Getting back together
makes perfect sense to me.

10:09.318 --> 10:10.694
I haven't heard such a misread

10:10.694 --> 10:13.322
since my grandmama ordered
a "chile reyeno."

10:13.864 --> 10:16.533
- Well, give me another reason
why it didn't work out with Daniel then.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.536
- Knock, knock.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.205
-Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

10:21.205 --> 10:24.041
- Is this a bad time?
- Your timing is impeccable.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.460
They're here to interview me
for Amy and Dave's wedding.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.336
Oh my gosh.

10:27.336 --> 10:30.506
I'm so sorry I haven't gotten back
to you guys about doing mine yet.

10:30.506 --> 10:32.841
Oh, they asked you too?

10:32.841 --> 10:34.092
It won't take long.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.762
Unless, like Ben's cousin,
you have a very detailed story

10:36.762 --> 10:38.972
about your wife cheating on you
with her math tutor.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.682
Why would an adult have a math tutor?

10:40.682 --> 10:42.142
I assume to have an affair with.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.021
So, um, Angel,

10:46.021 --> 10:48.982
are you ready to talk about
the enduring power of romantic love?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.108
Why stop now?

10:52.778 --> 10:56.365
- Okay. Are you ready
for some dry, unemotional vows?

10:56.365 --> 10:58.242
- You betcha.
- Okay.

10:58.909 --> 11:01.870
Dave, you are such a good dude.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.623
One of the very best dudes.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.875
Dave rhymes with brave.

11:06.875 --> 11:10.087
- You know, I hate being negative,
so I won't be.

11:10.087 --> 11:10.921
They're great.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.674
- No, they're not. They're awful.
I don't know what to do.

11:13.674 --> 11:17.261
- Well, uh, we could film them
and show them to our guests.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.471
- No, that's the tackiest thing
I've ever heard.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.430
We're not doing that.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.849
- Yeah. Tacky. Ugh.
- No.

11:22.766 --> 11:25.978
- Okay, Louise, I want
your honest feedback about our vows.

11:27.938 --> 11:28.856
Okay.

11:29.982 --> 11:33.151
Dave, I wasn't sure
that this day would ever come.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.528
But you were.

11:35.404 --> 11:38.282
I wasn't sure that love could survive
everything we put it through.

11:39.032 --> 11:39.908
But you were.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.245
You were always strong and always sure.

11:43.245 --> 11:46.456
And now I know that I want you
to stand by me

11:47.165 --> 11:48.292
for the rest of my life.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.836
That I am sure of.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.087
Ever since I was young,

11:52.838 --> 11:54.756
I never understood anything
about the world.

11:55.841 --> 11:58.468
And I never really understood anything
that happened in my life.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.139
The only thing that ever made sense
to me was you

12:02.931 --> 12:04.558
and how I felt about you.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.727
That's all I've ever known,

12:06.727 --> 12:08.103
and that's enough for me.

12:09.188 --> 12:12.191
That's enough for me
for the rest of my life, Amy.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.653
Oh my god.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.323
I don't understand
how you guys aren't bawling right now.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.782
That was so beautiful.

12:23.619 --> 12:24.912
These aren't our vows.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.830
These are Cory and Topanga's
from <i>Boy Meets World.</i>

12:27.873 --> 12:30.125
- What?
- Yeah. We couldn't get
through ours without crying.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.587
- You guys can't steal
other people's vows.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.672
I mean, why don't you
just do the standard:

12:35.672 --> 12:39.343
"Love is patient, love is kind,
blah, blah, blah, I do."

12:39.343 --> 12:41.553
Yikes. Uh, standard?

12:41.553 --> 12:43.430
Oh, Louise.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.016
Um, people are flying in from Colorado

12:46.016 --> 12:47.643
to witness raw, visceral love

12:47.643 --> 12:49.770
and have passed apps
and a casual black tie feel.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.397
Standard is not going to cut it. Okay?

12:53.607 --> 12:55.901
What is casual black tie?

12:55.901 --> 12:57.528
- She is allowing her friend
who broke her arm

12:57.528 --> 12:58.570
to wear her cast.

12:59.613 --> 13:00.656
You want a drink?

13:01.198 --> 13:02.908
MAGGIE:
Thanks for meeting me here.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.078
I'm so glad you called.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.206
I wanted to. We have quite a history.

13:09.206 --> 13:10.374
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

13:10.874 --> 13:14.837
Well, if we are sitting here right now,

13:14.837 --> 13:17.798
I hope that means that you might
still see a future with me.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.007
Funny you mention that,

13:19.007 --> 13:22.469
because I actually can't see the future.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.012
Maggie, please don't do that.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.013
- No.
- No, listen to me.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.723
I feel terrible about
what I said that night.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.433
No, no, no. That's not what I mean.

13:30.686 --> 13:32.271
My visions stopped.

13:32.271 --> 13:35.691
So you don't have to worry
about them anymore.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.651
- What do you mean they stopped?
- They're gone.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.488
Oh, but I'm fine with it.
Isn't that great?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.198
- Is it?
- Yes.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.701
I mean, at first, I was mad,

13:45.701 --> 13:47.286
and then I went and I bought
a bunch of crystals,

13:47.286 --> 13:49.830
which apparently, like underwear,
you can't return.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.040
But then I ran into you and I thought,

13:52.040 --> 13:54.626
maybe I'm not supposed
to get my visions back.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.921
Maybe I'm actually supposed
to date him instead.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.343
Supposed to?

14:03.343 --> 14:05.846
- Yeah, well, I also have
to get a whole new career,

14:05.846 --> 14:08.390
but I have an English degree,
and they said we can do anything.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.434
So no worries there.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.229
But--

14:15.606 --> 14:16.732
Maggie, look.

14:17.608 --> 14:18.901
I meant what I said.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.237
I think about you all the time.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.322
Me too.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.699
- But I feel like
you're still looking for signs

14:25.699 --> 14:27.242
to dictate your future

14:28.452 --> 14:30.579
instead of listening
to what you really want.

14:31.538 --> 14:32.623
No.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.585
- No, I want, I want this.
- Do you?

14:38.378 --> 14:41.089
Or you're just here because you're trying
to make sense of something.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.013
I don't know.

14:49.515 --> 14:52.184
♪

15:17.793 --> 15:18.877
Ugh.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.425
- Yoo-hoo. Coming in.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.802
Oh no.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.388
<i>When Harry Met Sally?</i>

15:29.763 --> 15:32.140
- Really? How many times
have you seen this movie?

15:32.766 --> 15:35.185
Harry has now met Sally 200 times.

15:35.185 --> 15:36.770
Oh dear.

15:36.770 --> 15:37.646
What?

15:37.646 --> 15:39.982
It's the best free
anti-depressant there is.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.316
Oh, excuse me.

15:41.316 --> 15:43.193
That's not true,
because I don't cost anything,

15:43.193 --> 15:44.403
and I'm a total hoot.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.949
Hey... is this about Daniel?

15:50.409 --> 15:52.327
No. That was a misfire.

15:54.079 --> 15:56.957
I'm starting to think I might not get
my visions back.

15:58.000 --> 15:58.750
Ever.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.587
Oh, Mags, I'm so sorry.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.464
You want to know my bigger fear?

16:05.674 --> 16:09.094
That I complained about them
so much that they finally left,

16:09.094 --> 16:11.430
and now I don't know
who I am without them.

16:11.430 --> 16:13.682
Alright, well, I know who you are, okay.

16:13.682 --> 16:16.143
You're Maggie.
Your favorite color is terracotta.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.811
Your hall pass is Clive Owen.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.897
And you are not the type
of person to give up,

16:19.897 --> 16:22.357
even when you do feel like
crawling up into a tiny ball.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.610
- I already tried that,
and my pants ripped.

16:24.610 --> 16:26.403
They were sweat pants, Lou. It was bad.

16:26.403 --> 16:28.155
Oh dear.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.657
- That does sound like rock bottom.
- Yeah.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.659
- But, hey, you know what,
if you think about,

16:32.659 --> 16:34.953
rock bottom is actually
kind of a cool place to be,

16:34.953 --> 16:37.873
because it means
that the best is yet to come.

16:38.582 --> 16:39.291
Hmm.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.380
I love it when you do that.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.967
- Do what?
- Make my life better.

16:50.761 --> 16:52.012
So what should I do now?

16:52.888 --> 16:56.225
And then...
every single moment after that?

16:56.225 --> 16:59.394
- It's not about what you should do.
It's about what you want to do.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.772
- You get to choose what comes next.
- Ugh.

17:01.772 --> 17:03.857
I like to go places that make me happy

17:03.857 --> 17:05.317
and see people who make me laugh.

17:06.318 --> 17:07.986
It's kind of why I came here.

17:11.907 --> 17:14.868
♪

17:22.376 --> 17:23.544
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.922
I think I'm finally ready
to talk about things.

17:28.841 --> 17:31.885
- The interview.
- The interview, yes. Yeah, come in.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.476
Sorry for showing up unannounced.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.395
Is now a bad time to do the interview?

17:41.395 --> 17:43.063
- Not at all.
Jessie's actually out

17:43.063 --> 17:45.232
interviewing your mom and dad right now,
so it'll just be me.

17:45.232 --> 17:48.861
- Wow, how did you master the art
of avoiding my parents so quickly?

17:48.861 --> 17:52.072
- Honestly, I just couldn't find
a clean pair of pants in time.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.782
These actually used to be white.

17:53.782 --> 17:56.368
So, uh, how does this work?

17:56.952 --> 17:59.079
Uh, yeah, you, uh, sit here.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.456
- Okay.
- And, uh,

18:01.456 --> 18:06.295
I just hit record
with my little contraption,

18:06.295 --> 18:09.423
and you can say anything you want
to Amy and Dave about love.

18:09.423 --> 18:12.050
- Hmm.
It's like in <i>When Harry Met Sally.</i>

18:12.050 --> 18:14.219
- Exactly.
- I just watched it.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.096
Really? What are the chances of that?

18:16.096 --> 18:17.097
Actually, pretty high.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.349
I watch it all the time.

18:19.349 --> 18:20.893
- I never took you for a rom-com person.

18:20.893 --> 18:21.852
Oh, come on.

18:21.852 --> 18:24.313
Two people struggling
to get the timing right.

18:24.313 --> 18:25.939
What could be more relatable than that?

18:27.816 --> 18:28.567
Yeah.

18:29.443 --> 18:31.987
- One day after work,
my pal Marty and I went down

18:31.987 --> 18:34.198
to the strip to see a punk band.

18:34.198 --> 18:35.657
And guess who is on bass?

18:36.533 --> 18:38.160
I spotted him in the crowd right away.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.828
I couldn't take my eyes off of him.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.163
- Mm-hmm.

18:41.163 --> 18:44.875
Yeah. And that kind of direct eye contact
made me very uncomfortable.

18:44.875 --> 18:45.876
So I looked away.

18:46.502 --> 18:48.712
Which I found very hot.

18:48.712 --> 18:49.671
- Mm-hmm?

18:50.797 --> 18:53.342
- So should I set the camera up now or--

18:54.092 --> 18:55.177
Alright.

18:55.177 --> 18:58.263
So if you can tell Amy and Dave
one thing about love,

18:58.263 --> 18:59.598
what would you say?

18:59.598 --> 19:03.519
- Huh, honestly, I feel like
I should be taking advice from them

19:03.519 --> 19:05.521
- and not the other way around.
- Really?

19:05.521 --> 19:08.774
Don't almost all your clients come
to you for relationship advice?

19:08.774 --> 19:09.983
Not anymore.

19:11.443 --> 19:12.444
I'm sorry.

19:13.654 --> 19:17.616
I know what it's like
to lose something abruptly

19:17.616 --> 19:18.617
that's important to you.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.995
Or, you know, at least... someone.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.710
- Did everyone try to tell you
about the five stages of grief?

19:28.710 --> 19:30.879
Yes, and it was really annoying.

19:30.879 --> 19:34.007
But in retrospect, they were totally real.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.301
I went through an anger phase
where I created

19:36.301 --> 19:38.720
this whole Sims neighborhood,
just to starve them all.

19:39.847 --> 19:42.224
- You're telling me. I almost
got back together with Daniel.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.684
Oh, you totally should have.

19:43.684 --> 19:45.811
- Really?
- No, he sucked!

19:47.229 --> 19:48.397
Why go back to Daniel?

19:48.397 --> 19:50.399
I told you, I'm bad at love.

19:50.941 --> 19:54.570
I used to blame my visions
for ruining my relationships,

19:54.570 --> 19:58.615
but it turns out I'm just
as hopeless without them.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.033
How do you mean?

20:00.033 --> 20:03.620
- It was never my visions
preventing me from being happy.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.621
It was me.

20:04.621 --> 20:07.207
Even without them,
I still worry about the future

20:07.207 --> 20:09.710
and preventing mistakes
before they happen and--

20:11.879 --> 20:15.007
Honestly, losing them
has been really difficult.

20:15.883 --> 20:17.009
But...

20:19.261 --> 20:21.722
maybe I need to use this as an opportunity

20:21.722 --> 20:24.808
to open myself up
and figure out what I want

20:25.726 --> 20:26.602
and who.

20:28.437 --> 20:31.523
- You know, every generation's
love language is different.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.902
We were never raised
to talk about our feelings.

20:35.569 --> 20:38.405
- Like now, it's all the rage
to say, "I'm an empath.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.823
He's a narcissist."

20:41.200 --> 20:42.534
I am a narcissist.

20:43.327 --> 20:44.369
No idea what she is.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.538
I guess if I could, um,

20:47.706 --> 20:51.502
if I could tell Amy and Dave
one thing about love,

20:51.502 --> 20:52.628
it would be

20:56.173 --> 20:58.342
to keep doing what I'm learning to do now.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.929
Living in their hearts
and not their heads.

21:06.099 --> 21:06.975
That was really good.

21:08.060 --> 21:10.145
You know,
I never heard you talk like that.

21:11.271 --> 21:15.400
- Yeah. I, I guess you just...
caught me at the right moment.

21:17.528 --> 21:19.321
Timing's a funny thing, huh?

21:21.114 --> 21:22.074
Really is.

21:23.033 --> 21:23.992
Yeah.

21:24.576 --> 21:27.037
- You kids think
about your options too much.

21:27.037 --> 21:27.829
Hmm.

21:27.829 --> 21:30.207
- This game of musical chairs
isn't going to last forever.

21:30.207 --> 21:32.334
One day, the music is going to stop,

21:32.334 --> 21:34.002
and you're going to be standing all alone.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.964
But not you. You were smart.

21:36.964 --> 21:38.173
What do you mean?

21:38.173 --> 21:40.509
- Well, it couldn't have been easy
to move into the duplex with Ben

21:40.509 --> 21:43.136
after he and Maggie had that thing.

21:43.136 --> 21:46.348
But you picked your chair
and you're staying in it.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.683
That's nice.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.478
I'm sorry. What thing?

21:51.478 --> 21:52.896
You know, the thing.

21:54.857 --> 21:57.192
You do know, right?

22:00.779 --> 22:01.822
Yeah.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.032
Yeah, of course.
