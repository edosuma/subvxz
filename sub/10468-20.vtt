09:15.685 --> 09:17.034
WHAT?

09:17.034 --> 09:18.601
THAT GOOFY SMILE
ON YOUR FACE.

09:18.601 --> 09:19.907
WHAT'S GOING ON
OVER THERE?

09:19.907 --> 09:23.388
OH, I HAD THE MOST
AMAZING DREAM
LAST NIGHT, JULIA.

09:23.388 --> 09:24.955
IT'S BEEN WITH ME
ALL DAY LONG.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.740
OH, YEAH?
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?

09:26.740 --> 09:28.089
ME AND TODD...

09:29.133 --> 09:30.482
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:30.482 --> 09:32.484
WELL, WE WERE IN HIS CAR,

09:32.484 --> 09:35.879
WHICH HE LOVES MORE THAN
ANYONE SHOULD LOVE A CAR,
IN MY OPINION...

09:35.879 --> 09:38.229
AND HE WAS ACTUALLY
LETTING ME DRIVE IT.

09:38.229 --> 09:42.103
WHICH I NEVER HAVE,
BECAUSE HE NEVER LETS ME,
LIKE, EVER...

09:42.103 --> 09:44.409
SO I'M DRIVING...

09:44.409 --> 09:46.455
AND I'M HITTING
EVERY GREEN LIGHT.

09:46.455 --> 09:49.066
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
WE'RE NOT ON THE STREET ANYMORE.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.242
WE'RE ACTUALLY FLYING.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.158
SOUNDS SYMBOLIC.

09:54.158 --> 09:56.552
SO HE LOOKS AT ME, AND...

09:56.552 --> 09:59.076
HE SMILES AND SAYS,

09:59.076 --> 10:02.036
"YOU MADE THE CAR FLY."

10:02.036 --> 10:04.952
AND THEN HE, LIKE,
REACHES INTO HIS CHEST, BUT...

10:04.952 --> 10:08.695
I MEAN, IT'S NOT GROSS
OR ANYTHING,
AND HE PULLS OUT...

10:08.695 --> 10:10.827
THIS KEY IN THE SHAPE
OF A HEART.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.744
JULIA, THE KEY TO HIS HEART.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.311
UH-HUH.

10:16.311 --> 10:19.488
AND HE HANDS IT TO ME,
AND HE SAYS,

10:19.488 --> 10:21.925
"I LOVE YOU, CLAUDIA."

10:23.013 --> 10:24.406
[WHISPERING]
Just like that.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.626
JUST SO...

10:26.626 --> 10:29.324
SIMPLE AND REAL.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.154
ISN'T THAT INCREDIBLE?

10:34.938 --> 10:36.157
I GUESS.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.941
YOU GUESS.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

10:37.941 --> 10:40.204
WELL, IT'S JUST
A DREAM, CLAUD.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.729
YEAH, BUT IT WAS SO REAL
WHEN HE SAID IT.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.211
HMM.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.823
STILL I JUST DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD GET CAUGHT UP
IN SOMETHING

10:49.823 --> 10:51.085
YOU WISH HE'D SAID.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.224
SO IT'S NOT A DISASTER.
WE'LL HANDLE IT,
YOU KNOW?

11:00.224 --> 11:02.444
IT JUST MEANS DELIVERING
A WEEK OR TWO PAST DUE.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.402
THE--THE ONLY THING
THAT CONCERNS ME
IS IT'S GETTING WORSE.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.013
I KNOW.
LAST WEEK,
WE WERE AVERAGING

11:06.013 --> 11:07.841
6 DAYS LATE, AND
THIS WEEK, IT'S 8.
I KNOW.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.234
I KNOW. IT'S NOT GOOD.
LET'S JUST SEE
WHAT MITCH HAS TO SAY.

11:10.234 --> 11:11.975
HEY.
HEY...

11:11.975 --> 11:13.673
HOW'S IT GOING?

11:13.673 --> 11:14.804
WELL, WE'RE, UH...

11:14.804 --> 11:16.501
WE'RE UP TO
4 PIECES AN HOUR,

11:16.501 --> 11:19.200
AND I DON'T THINK
THE GUYS CAN DO IT
MUCH FASTER THAN THAT.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.767
WHY AREN'T THEY
PARTNERED UP?

11:20.767 --> 11:21.898
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
WE TALKED ABOUT

11:21.898 --> 11:23.900
PUTTIN' 2 GUYS ON
THESE BACK ASSEMBLIES.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.076
YEAH, I--I THOUGHT
ABOUT IT, BUT THAT
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

11:26.076 --> 11:29.166
I MEAN, TO PUT 2 GUYS
ON THE SAME PIECE,
THE MATH SAYS--

11:29.166 --> 11:31.821
MITCH...WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS. I MEAN...

11:31.821 --> 11:33.736
YOU CAN'T EVEN
GIVE IT A TRY?

11:33.736 --> 11:35.651
SURE, YOU WANT ME
TO SHUT DOWN THE LINE FOR A DAY

11:35.651 --> 11:37.566
WHILE THE GUYS
LEARN NEW JOBS

11:37.566 --> 11:39.350
WHEN IT'S 90% THAT
IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.135
YES. YES, I DO.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.266
I ASKED YOU
TO GIVE IT A SHOT.

11:42.266 --> 11:43.441
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU DECIDING

11:43.441 --> 11:44.965
THAT I'M WRONG
ALL ON YOUR OWN.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.227
OK. HOLD ON...

11:46.227 --> 11:47.750
MITCH, I THINK WHAT
WE'RE SAYING IS,
TRY AND LOOK

11:47.750 --> 11:49.012
AT THE BIG PICTURE
HERE...

11:49.012 --> 11:50.710
OK? A LITTLE TIME...

11:50.710 --> 11:53.190
LOST NOW, LEARNING
HOW TO BUILD THIS
STUFF RIGHT,

11:53.190 --> 11:54.322
THAT'S TIME
WELL SPENT.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.280
LOOK, YOU GUYS HIRED ME
OUT OF MY LAST JOB

11:56.280 --> 11:58.979
TO GET THIS PLACE MOVING.
AND YOU TOLD ME
WHEN WE SAT DOWN,

11:58.979 --> 12:01.895
YOU SAID
THAT WE'RE NOT ABOUT
MICROMANAGEMENT HERE,

12:01.895 --> 12:03.200
EVERYBODY GETS A PIECE
OF THE BUSINESS,

12:03.200 --> 12:04.680
YOU CAN BE
YOUR OWN BOSS.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.812
WELL,
THAT'S RIGHT...

12:05.812 --> 12:07.727
MITCH,
YOU OWN A PIECE
OF THE COMPANY,

12:07.727 --> 12:09.163
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN WE DON'T STILL

12:09.163 --> 12:10.425
HAVE A MANAGEMENT
STRUCTURE HERE, OR--

12:10.425 --> 12:12.079
LOOK, I WANT YOU
TO DOUBLE THEM UP.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.210
OK?

12:13.210 --> 12:14.690
IF IT DOESN'T WORK,

12:14.690 --> 12:17.040
THEN WE CAN ALWAYS
GO BACK TO YOUR WAY.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.086
ALL RIGHT?

12:21.871 --> 12:23.525
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.848
THE NATURE OF CRITICAL
EVALUATION IN 18th-
CENTURY ROMANTICISM.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.241
YIKES.
SIT DOWN.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.330
THIS HAS GOTTA BE
FOR MS. SHAW.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.767
READING
IS HARD ENOUGH,
BUT WRITING ABOUT

12:47.767 --> 12:49.420
HOW OTHER PEOPLE
WROTE ABOUT WRITING?

12:49.420 --> 12:51.118
JUST SEEMS LIKE
SO MUCH WRITING.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.772
SO...

12:52.772 --> 12:53.860
DON'T DO IT.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.078
YEAH, RIGHT.
I MEAN IT.

12:55.078 --> 12:56.253
ADAM--
COME WITH ME

12:56.253 --> 12:57.646
TO MEXICO INSTEAD.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.909
YOU'RE KIDDING,
RIGHT?

12:59.909 --> 13:01.258
I MEAN IT.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.477
I MEAN, I WAS
THINKING ABOUT IT,

13:02.477 --> 13:05.045
AND, JULIA,
YOU WOULD LOVE SAN MIGUEL.

13:05.045 --> 13:08.570
I MEAN, IT'S GOT
COBBLESTONE STREETS
AND GOTHIC CATHEDRALS.

13:08.570 --> 13:11.791
THERE'S 2 ART INSTITUTES
THERE, THERE'S WEIRD
CREATIVE TYPES EVERYWHERE,

13:11.791 --> 13:14.097
AND IT'S GOT THE COFFEE
THAT YOU CAN'T GET HERE,

13:14.097 --> 13:16.230
THE KIND THAT'S LIKE MUD.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.927
ADAM...HA.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.581
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.
NOT, UH...

13:19.581 --> 13:21.017
RIGHT NOW.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.019
I CAN'T JUST PACK UP
AND MOVE TO MEXICO.

13:23.019 --> 13:25.979
OF COURSE YOU CAN.
WHY CAN'T YOU?

13:25.979 --> 13:28.677
WELL, 'CAUSE
I'VE GOT SCHOOL,
FOR ONE THING.

13:28.677 --> 13:29.678
SO?

13:29.678 --> 13:31.462
YOU TAKE A LEAVE OF ABSENCE.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.813
I CAN GET YOU
INTO MY WORKSHOP
AT THE INSTITUTE,

13:33.813 --> 13:34.901
AND YOU'LL GET
FULL CREDIT HERE.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.119
IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.382
UM, I'VE GOT OTHER
RESPONSIBILITIES.

13:38.382 --> 13:39.383
LIKE?

13:39.383 --> 13:40.471
LIKE MY FAMILY.

13:40.471 --> 13:41.516
SO COME FOR A MONTH.

13:41.516 --> 13:44.084
COME FOR A WEEK EVEN.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.085
BUT I WARN YOU...

13:45.085 --> 13:46.434
WHEN YOU GET DOWN THERE,

13:46.434 --> 13:48.610
YOU ARE NOT GONNA
WANT TO LEAVE.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.307
OH...

13:51.526 --> 13:53.223
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE PARADISE.

13:53.223 --> 13:54.398
IT WOULD BE...

13:54.398 --> 13:56.705
IF YOU WERE THERE.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.893
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN',
WILL?

14:10.893 --> 14:12.460
BAY, I GOTTA KNOW
THIS STUFF:

14:12.460 --> 14:15.028
WHAT COLOR
HER TOOTHBRUSH IS,
WHAT BRAND OF...

14:15.028 --> 14:16.551
THIS SHE USES.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.945
WILL, I DON'T KNOW
HALF THAT STUFF.
I DON'T REALLY--

14:18.945 --> 14:20.642
DOES SHE USE
PINS OR BARRETTES?
DOES SHE FLOSS?

14:20.642 --> 14:23.166
DOES SHE USE--OW!

14:23.166 --> 14:24.298
BLOOD.
IT'S GOT YOUR FINGER...

14:24.298 --> 14:25.299
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:25.299 --> 14:26.300
I CUT MYSELF.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.823
OHH. I HAVE BANDAGES.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.346
YEAH, DON'T WORRY.
HE KNOWS.

14:29.346 --> 14:30.826
WOULD YOU PLEASE TELL HIM

14:30.826 --> 14:32.219
HE DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW EVERY SINGLE

14:32.219 --> 14:34.003
INTIMATE DETAIL
OF YOUR LIFE.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.048
I MEAN, NEXT THING,
HE'S GONNA BE

14:35.048 --> 14:37.528
HUNTING THROUGH
YOUR UNDERWEAR DRAWER.

14:37.528 --> 14:38.529
UNDERWEAR
DRAWER.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.748
PUT IT ON THE LIST.

14:39.748 --> 14:42.055
COME ON.

14:43.665 --> 14:45.188
HERE YOU ARE.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.494
GIVE ME YOUR FINGER.

14:46.494 --> 14:47.538
I'M SORRY.

14:47.538 --> 14:48.539
I WAS GOING THROUGH THINGS.

14:48.539 --> 14:49.540
I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

14:49.540 --> 14:50.846
WILL, PLEASE,
DON'T APOLOGIZE.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.979
YOUR APOLOGIZING
SEEMS KINDA
BACKWARDS.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.198
WHAT?

14:55.198 --> 14:58.027
EVERY TIME
I LOOK AT YOU,
I FEEL SO GUILTY.

14:58.027 --> 15:01.509
ALL THIS STRESS
AND ANXIETY FROM
A STUPID GREEN CARD.

15:01.509 --> 15:02.510
WAIT--WAIT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:02.510 --> 15:04.033
DON'T FEEL BAD.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.340
IF I WEREN'T SUCH A COWARD,
I MEAN, THIS WOULDN'T
BE ANYTHING.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.994
COWARD?

15:07.994 --> 15:10.257
WILL,
ARE YOU KIDDING?

15:10.257 --> 15:12.041
YOU GIVE YOURSELF
SO LITTLE CREDIT
SOMETIMES.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.435
IF ONLY I COULD TELL
YOU HOW COMPLETELY
IN AWE I AM OF YOU.

15:14.435 --> 15:17.046
NO...YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE IN AWE.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.266
OH, REALLY IT'S...

15:19.266 --> 15:21.268
IT'S VERY HUMBLING.

15:21.268 --> 15:24.184
I DON'T KNOW IF
I COULD DO WHAT
YOU'RE DOING. IT'S...

15:26.012 --> 15:27.361
VERY UNSELFISH.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.028
UM...YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:42.028 --> 15:43.464
I THINK I CAN FINISH THAT.

15:43.464 --> 15:44.900
OK.

15:44.900 --> 15:48.295
THANKS.

15:48.295 --> 15:52.255
BECAUSE BRONT BELIEVED
THAT IN ORDER TO CREATE
A TRUE ROMANTIC HEROINE,

15:52.255 --> 15:55.606
SHE HERSELF
HAD TO BE CARRIED AWAY
BY HER CHARACTERS,

15:55.606 --> 15:58.435
HER WORK,
BY HER OWN LIFE.

15:58.435 --> 16:02.700
AND SO,
SHE CREATED JANE--

16:02.700 --> 16:06.182
JANE, WHO REJECTS
PURITAN CONVENTION

16:06.182 --> 16:08.010
AND LIVES BY HER HEART,

16:08.010 --> 16:12.362
WHO IS BROUGHT BACK
TO HER LOVER
BY A PASSIONATE DREAM.

16:12.362 --> 16:17.715
MESSAGE?
DON'T GET BOGGED DOWN
BY RULES AND MORES.

16:17.715 --> 16:22.198
FLY. FOLLOW YOUR URGES.
LISTEN TO YOUR HEARTS.

16:22.198 --> 16:25.071
THAT'S THE WAY
TO TRUE PROLIFIC FREEDOM

16:25.071 --> 16:26.550
AND CREATIVE FULFILLMENT.

16:26.550 --> 16:30.076
NOT TO MENTION
A VERY HOT LOVE LIFE.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.691
WHO WAS ON THE PHONE
JUST NOW?

16:36.691 --> 16:38.301
THE TRAVEL AGENT.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.608
THEY WANTED
TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE WERE, UM,

16:40.608 --> 16:42.827
WE KNEW WE WERE
GONNA BE PAYING
A CANCELLATION FEE.

16:42.827 --> 16:45.308
MMM, THAT'S RIGHT.
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

16:45.308 --> 16:46.962
I WAS GONNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT,

16:46.962 --> 16:48.268
BUT THEN YOU GOT HOME
SO LATE.

16:48.268 --> 16:49.747
YOU CANCELLED
THE WEEKEND?

16:49.747 --> 16:51.619
I MEAN, I WAS
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO DOING THAT WITH YOU.

16:51.619 --> 16:52.968
I KNOW. I KNOW.
ME, TOO.

16:52.968 --> 16:54.404
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE NICE

16:54.404 --> 16:56.580
IF WE STAYED HOME
AND JUST RELAXED.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.627
[SIGHS] KIRSTEN,
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

16:59.627 --> 17:00.932
I MEAN, THEY CAN
FIND ME AT HOME.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.108
THEY CAN DRAG ME
INTO WORK.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.066
THEY CAN'T DRAG ME
INTO WORK IN CARMEL.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.589
I KNOW.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

17:05.589 --> 17:07.678
I MEAN...WE JUST
FINISHED SAYING

17:07.678 --> 17:08.853
THAT WE WERE GONNA
MAKE TIME FOR EACH OTHER.

17:08.853 --> 17:11.334
THAT'S WHY WE PLANNED
THE WHOLE WEEKEND.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.902
OK, DON'T BE MAD
AT ME.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.992
BUT I THOUGHT
ABOUT GOING SO FAR,

17:16.992 --> 17:18.515
YOU KNOW, ALL
THE WAY TO CARMEL,

17:18.515 --> 17:20.648
AND I JUST FELT LIKE
I DON'T WANT TO BE

17:20.648 --> 17:22.476
THAT FAR AWAY
FROM MY DOCTOR.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.478
KIRSTEN...

17:24.478 --> 17:25.957
COME ON.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.569
I MEAN, IT'S ONE THING
TO NOT WANT TO PUT A CRIB
IN YOUR HOUSE,

17:28.569 --> 17:30.353
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA GO
SHUTTING YOURSELF IN--

17:30.353 --> 17:32.051
I'M NOT SHUTTING
MYSELF IN.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.575
I'M JUST--WE CAN GO
TO THE MOVIES.

17:34.575 --> 17:35.793
WE CAN GO FOR
SOMETHING TO EAT.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.839
IF THERE'S NOT
SOME BIG CRISIS AT WORK,

17:37.839 --> 17:38.753
WHICH THERE WILL BE.

17:38.753 --> 17:40.450
LOOK, CHARLIE,

17:40.450 --> 17:43.279
I HAVE WAITED LONGER
FOR THIS.

17:43.279 --> 17:46.456
I HAVE WORKED
HARDER FOR THIS
THAN FOR ANYTHING.

17:46.456 --> 17:50.243
I MEAN, HONESTLY,
WHY WOULD I TAKE
ANY CHANCES?

17:56.379 --> 17:58.512
THIS IS NICE, HUH?

17:59.643 --> 18:03.082
JUST US SITTING HERE
READING,

18:03.082 --> 18:05.388
DOING OUR HOMEWORK,
YOU KNOW?

18:05.388 --> 18:07.434
JUST BEING TOGETHER,

18:07.434 --> 18:11.264
NOT HAVING
TO SAY A WORD.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.529
YOU WANT TO TAKE A DRIVE?

18:15.529 --> 18:17.748
WHAT? WHERE?

18:17.748 --> 18:19.533
I DON'T KNOW, ANYWHERE.

18:19.533 --> 18:22.710
I MEAN,
JUST HOP IN THE CAR
AND JUST FLY.

18:22.710 --> 18:23.841
YOU KNOW?

18:23.841 --> 18:25.756
SURE,
IF YOU WANT TO.

18:25.756 --> 18:29.282
JUST, UM,
LET ME FINISH
THIS CHAPTER FIRST.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.110
OK.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.982
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.987
DO YOU THINK
I COULD MAYBE DRIVE?

18:38.987 --> 18:40.597
WOULD YOU MIND?

18:40.597 --> 18:44.427
UM, WELL, I--I WOULD,

18:44.427 --> 18:49.215
EXCEPT...YOU REMEMBER?
THE--THE LEASE THING.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.043
IT'S A KIND OF INSURANCE,
WON'T LET ANYONE
DRIVE BUT ME, SO...

18:52.043 --> 18:53.871
OH.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.134
OK.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.529
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M A VERY GOOD DRIVER,
DO YOU?

18:59.529 --> 19:00.965
WHAT?

19:00.965 --> 19:02.619
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

19:02.619 --> 19:04.143
YOU JUST DON'T TRUST ME.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.405
NO. CLAUDIA, I DO.

19:05.405 --> 19:08.277
BECAUSE, TODD,
I TRUST YOU COMPLETELY.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.801
I MEAN,
YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND,

19:10.801 --> 19:14.196
AND I TRUST YOU AND...

19:14.196 --> 19:16.459
LOVE YOU, AND...

19:16.459 --> 19:19.767
I WOULD LET YOU
DRIVE MY CAR IF I HAD ONE.

19:25.033 --> 19:28.167
BUT, UM...

19:28.167 --> 19:31.866
OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T
FEEL THE SAME WAY.

19:33.215 --> 19:36.044
UM, I'LL JUST...

19:37.654 --> 19:40.179
CLAUD, WAIT.

19:46.663 --> 19:49.666
HEY. I GOT SOME CHECKS
I NEED YOU TO SIGN HERE.

19:49.666 --> 19:52.191
ALSO A COUPLE OF CONTRACTS
YOU OUGHT TO LOOK OVER--

19:52.191 --> 19:53.453
NOT NOW.
LOOK, I NEED YOU

19:53.453 --> 19:55.672
TO DRAW UP
A SEVERANCE PACKAGE
FOR MITCH.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.544
I'M LETTING HIM GO.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.546
WHAT?

20:01.025 --> 20:02.549
CHARLIE, WHY?

20:02.549 --> 20:04.507
I TOLD HIM TO TRY
RUNNING THE LINE MY WAY,

20:04.507 --> 20:07.336
AND HE COMPLETELY
IGNORED ME.

20:07.336 --> 20:08.424
HE DID?

20:08.424 --> 20:10.383
YEAH. I WAS
JUST DOWN THERE.

20:10.383 --> 20:11.688
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.212
[SIGHS]

20:13.212 --> 20:14.778
OK, LOOK.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.607
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

20:17.607 --> 20:20.262
BUT BEFORE WE START
THROWING MONEY AWAY
ON A SEVERANCE DEAL,

20:20.262 --> 20:21.611
LET ME GO DOWN THERE
AND TRY AND
TALK TO HIM.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.613
BAILEY, NO OFFENSE, MAN,
BUT HOW?

20:23.613 --> 20:25.920
I MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW
A DOWEL FROM A SPINDLE.

20:25.920 --> 20:30.446
OK, BUT I KNOW
A PAYCHECK
FROM A PINK SLIP.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.448
LOOK, IF THE GUY
CAN'T RUN THE LINE
ANY FASTER,

20:32.448 --> 20:35.059
HE'S NOT WORTH IT.
HE CAN'T DO THE JOB.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.279
LOOK AT THE SITUATION HERE.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.150
IF I START TO LOSE ORDERS

20:39.150 --> 20:42.066
AND I CAN'T PAY BACK
THE MONEY THAT I BORROWED
TO EXPAND THIS PLACE

20:42.066 --> 20:43.764
AND THIS BUSINESS
GOES UNDER...

20:43.764 --> 20:45.592
SO WHO'S GONNA
RUN THE LINE
IF MITCH GOES?

20:45.592 --> 20:47.507
NOT ME, OBVIOUSLY.

20:48.725 --> 20:49.813
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.119
WHEN?

20:51.119 --> 20:53.687
WE'VE GOT CHAIRS DUE
MORE THAN A WEEK AGO,
CHARLIE,

20:53.687 --> 20:55.341
AND PEOPLE ARE GONNA
START CANCELLING
THEIR ORDERS.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.691
FINE, I'LL DO IT.
I'LL RUN THE LINE.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.301
YOU WILL?

20:59.301 --> 21:01.216
WHO'S GONNA DO
YOUR JOB?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.001
YOU CAN'T
DO IT ALL.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.221
CHARLIE, THAT'S WHY
YOU HIRED MITCH.

21:06.221 --> 21:08.528
AND ME.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.837
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

21:13.837 --> 21:15.839
IT'S OPEN.

21:16.710 --> 21:17.711
HI.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.278
HEY.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.889
I WASN'T EXPECTING
TO SEE YOU.

21:21.889 --> 21:23.673
DID YOU FINISH
YOUR ESSAY?

21:23.673 --> 21:25.632
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

21:25.632 --> 21:26.981
WHAT?!

21:26.981 --> 21:28.983
FOR A MONTH,
6 WEEKS MAYBE,

21:28.983 --> 21:30.158
AND THEN
I COME HOME.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.725
YOU ARE NOT
GONNA WANT TO LEAVE.

21:31.725 --> 21:34.336
WE WILL SEE.
WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

21:34.336 --> 21:35.772
I WANT SOMETHING
TO WRITE ABOUT

21:35.772 --> 21:37.252
THAT'S NOT OTHER
WRITERS WRITING

21:37.252 --> 21:39.080
ABOUT OTHER
WRITERS WRITING.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.516
HA HA HA HA HA!
YES!

21:42.823 --> 21:44.172
WELL, WHEN CAN YOU LEAVE?

21:44.172 --> 21:47.044
WELL, I CLEARED IT
WITH DEAN DiSTEFANO
THIS AFTERNOON,

21:47.044 --> 21:48.524
SO I GUESS ALL
I HAVE TO DO NOW

21:48.524 --> 21:50.874
IS...TELL MY FAMILY.

22:06.107 --> 22:08.327
AND THEN,
IF BILL AND MARTY HAVE
THE JOINTS PEGGED,

22:08.327 --> 22:10.677
THEN WE'LL HAVE
2 PIECES PREPPED
AT THE SAME TIME, OK?

22:10.677 --> 22:12.505
LET'S TRY THAT.

22:13.897 --> 22:16.639
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:16.639 --> 22:18.641
I THOUGHT THAT
4 HANDS ON THE JOB

22:18.641 --> 22:20.251
MIGHT SAVE US ENOUGH TIME
TO JUSTIFY MOVING THE--

22:20.251 --> 22:23.124
CHARLIE,
I'VE HEARD THE PLAN
PLENTY OF TIMES.

22:23.124 --> 22:25.082
BUT WE HAVEN'T
TRIED IT YET.

22:25.082 --> 22:27.258
LOOK, IF I'M
IN YOUR WAY HERE,

22:27.258 --> 22:28.782
JUST COME OUT
AND SAY IT.

22:28.782 --> 22:29.913
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

22:29.913 --> 22:30.958
DO YOU WANT ME
OUT OF HERE?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.742
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WANT, MITCH.

22:32.742 --> 22:35.136
THEN WHY ARE YOU
DOING MY JOB HERE?

22:35.136 --> 22:37.051
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF THIS MIGHT WORK BETTER.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.966
MITCH, GIVE ME
A BREAK HERE.

22:38.966 --> 22:42.186
IF I'M WRONG,
WE CAN ALWAYS GO BACK
TO YOUR IDEA.

22:42.186 --> 22:44.667
IF NOT, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH GIVING IT A TRY?

22:44.667 --> 22:46.103
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT'S WRONG.

22:46.103 --> 22:48.628
YOU DON'T TRUST ME
TO KNOW MY JOB.
ADMIT IT.

WHAT I'M DOING DOWN HERE.

I--I TELL YOU WHAT.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.762
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING
THERE WAITING FOR ME

22:52.762 --> 22:54.285
TO CRAP OUT
SINCE DAY ONE.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.331
SO I'M GONNA SAVE
YOU THE TROUBLE.

22:56.331 --> 22:57.811
I QUIT.

23:09.039 --> 23:12.260
HEY. GOT YOUR
OWN KEY NOW, HUH?

23:12.260 --> 23:15.350
YEAH. YOU GONNA BE
STUDYING HERE?

23:15.350 --> 23:18.005
YEAH, THAT WAS
THE PLAN. WHY?

23:18.005 --> 23:20.529
WELL, 'CAUSE HOLLY
AND I HAVE SOME
WORK TO DO LATER,

AS LONG
AS YOU'RE HERE,

SOME QUESTIONS
FOR YOU TO ANSWER.

LIKE, UH, WHICH
SIDE OF THE BED
DOES SHE SLEEP ON?

LEFT.

23:35.544 --> 23:39.374
OH. WHICH PUTS ME
ON THE RIGHT.

23:39.374 --> 23:41.681
ACTUALLY,
PUTS ME ON THE RIGHT.

23:41.681 --> 23:42.856
RIGHT.

UH,
WHAT'S HER FAVORITE
SEXUAL POSITION?

23:47.295 --> 23:48.339
WHAT?!

23:48.339 --> 23:49.384

23:49.384 --> 23:50.516

THESE QUESTIONS

FROM A GIRLFRIEND

WHO WENT THROUGH
THE SAME THING

THIS STUFF, BAILEY.

SHE MADE THE LIST.

23:56.130 --> 23:59.960
WHICH IS...
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.614
SOME OF THIS STUFF.

NOTHING. NEVER MIND.

OK, ONE
OF THE QUESTIONS

24:09.926 --> 24:12.146
THEY ASKED
THE GIRLFRIEND WAS,

24:12.146 --> 24:14.061
"WHAT WAS
YOUR WORST FIGHT?"

24:14.061 --> 24:16.759
AND SHE PUT DOWN

THE POINT.

YOU'D DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW,

24:41.131 --> 24:43.046

ABOUT THIS WITH YOU.

TO BREAK UP.

YOU WERE RIGHT, JULIA,

WANTED TO HAPPEN.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.595
OH, YES.

25:53.595 --> 25:56.250
I GUESS I JUST, YOU KNOW,
HAD TO GO TO HIM

25:56.250 --> 25:58.252
AND ASK HIM IF
I COULD DRIVE HIS CAR.

25:58.252 --> 25:59.993
AND HE SAID NO?

25:59.993 --> 26:01.951
OF COURSE HE SAID NO.

26:01.951 --> 26:03.605
AND THEN I HAD TO TEST
THE REST OF THE DREAM

26:03.605 --> 26:05.041
BY TELLING HIM
THAT I LOVED HIM.

26:05.041 --> 26:07.000

DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY.

TO HEAR HIM SAY IT BACK?

MAKE SOMETHING UP

ON MY BRAIN.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.427
YES, SO LET IT GO,
PLEASE.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.473
YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW MUCH THIS MATTERS
TO ME, BAILEY.

28:12.473 --> 28:13.866
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.737
I UNDERSTAND THAT
IT MATTERS TO YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

28:15.737 --> 28:16.738
MEANING WHAT? YOU?

28:16.738 --> 28:18.131
YEAH, THAT'S
HOW IT FEELS.

28:18.131 --> 28:19.654
WELL, THEN,
MAYBE IT'S TRUE.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.663
LOOK--
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?

28:29.664 --> 28:31.318
YOU SHOULD
GET READY.

28:32.188 --> 28:35.061
NO. BAILEY...

28:35.061 --> 28:37.846
PLEASE LET ME SAY THIS.

28:37.846 --> 28:41.284
YOU KNOW WHAT MY LIFE
HAS BEEN LIKE,

28:41.284 --> 28:43.634
WITH MUM AND DAD
MOVING US AROUND,

28:43.634 --> 28:45.462
ALL THE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS
AND THE TRAVELING.

28:45.462 --> 28:47.290
WELL, THROUGH ALL THAT,
THE ONE THING THAT I'VE HAD,

28:47.290 --> 28:48.857
THE ONE THING THAT
I'VE BEEN SURE OF

28:48.857 --> 28:51.773
IS I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR.

28:53.427 --> 28:56.822
NOW, YOU KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.

28:56.822 --> 29:01.957
BUT THIS...FOR CERTAIN,
IS MY FUTURE,

29:01.957 --> 29:03.524
AND I KNOW THAT.

29:04.830 --> 29:08.834
AS FOR US...

29:08.834 --> 29:12.838
I JUST CAN'T KNOW THAT
IN THE SAME WAY.

29:16.015 --> 29:17.538
I CAN'T.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.763
[SOBBING]

29:33.293 --> 29:34.511
KIRSTEN?

29:34.511 --> 29:35.512
[SOBS]

29:35.512 --> 29:37.732
ARE YOU OK?

29:37.732 --> 29:40.169
NO. I...

29:40.169 --> 29:43.216
KIRSTEN,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:45.784 --> 29:47.481
ARE YOU PREGNANT?

29:47.481 --> 29:49.222
I CAME BY
TO PICK UP THE BOOKS

29:49.222 --> 29:52.007
THAT CHARLIE HAD
FOR WHEN DAPHNE
WAS PREGNANT.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.836
[SOBBING]

29:54.836 --> 29:57.186
SOMETHING FELT WRONG,
AND I--I CHECKED,

29:57.186 --> 29:58.840
AND I'M BLEEDING.

29:58.840 --> 30:02.322
OH, GOD.
OK. DON'T PANIC.

30:02.322 --> 30:05.151
UM, COME HERE.

30:05.151 --> 30:06.848
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?
ARE YOU HAVING CRAMPS?

30:06.848 --> 30:08.589
ARE YOU...

30:08.589 --> 30:09.764
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.200
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.115
OH, KIRSTEN, IT'S OK.

30:13.115 --> 30:16.379
IT'S OK.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OK.

30:16.379 --> 30:17.467
YOU KNOW WHAT?

30:17.467 --> 30:18.555
[SOBS]

30:18.555 --> 30:19.730
I WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.602
I'M GONNA GET YOU
TO A DOCTOR, OK?

30:22.472 --> 30:24.605
GENTLY, GENTLY. OK.

30:33.614 --> 30:34.876
HEY.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.573
HI.
WHERE'S KIRSTEN?

30:36.573 --> 30:37.792
SHE'S IN WITH THE DOCTOR,

30:37.792 --> 30:39.228
AND THEY SAID SHE'D BE OUT
IN A MINUTE.

30:39.228 --> 30:40.229
IS SHE OK?

30:40.229 --> 30:41.230
I DON'T KNOW.

30:41.230 --> 30:42.362
I MEAN, SHE WASN'T
FEELING ANY PAIN,

30:42.362 --> 30:43.406
BUT, UH...

30:43.406 --> 30:45.104
I'M GONNA GO IN
AND SEE.

30:46.757 --> 30:47.628
IT'S OK.

30:47.628 --> 30:48.934
OHH.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.153
THE BABY'S OK.
WE'RE BOTH FINE.

30:51.153 --> 30:52.938
THANK GOD.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.287
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:55.505 --> 30:57.768
I STARTED BLEEDING,

30:57.768 --> 31:00.032
AND JULIA FOUND ME
AND BROUGHT ME HERE.

31:00.032 --> 31:02.773
THANK GOD SHE WAS THERE,
BECAUSE...

31:02.773 --> 31:05.298
I COULDN'T MOVE.
I WAS SO FREAKED OUT.

31:05.298 --> 31:07.039
WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY?

31:07.039 --> 31:09.780
SHE DID, UH, SOME TESTS
AND A SONOGRAM.

31:09.780 --> 31:13.784
AND IT TURNS OUT I JUST--
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
PROGESTERONE IN MY SYSTEM.

31:13.784 --> 31:15.090
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

31:15.090 --> 31:18.354
THE BLOOD, IT CAME
FROM THE ENDOMETRIUM,

31:18.354 --> 31:21.401
NOT THE BABY
OR THE PLACENTA.

31:21.401 --> 31:23.316
IT'S PRETTY COMMON,
SHE SAYS.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.231
I JUST NEED TO TAKE
SOME HORMONES.

31:28.321 --> 31:30.497
WELL, I GUESS YOU
WEREN'T WRONG

31:30.497 --> 31:32.020
ABOUT NOT
GOING AWAY, HUH?

31:32.020 --> 31:35.023
NO, BUT...

31:35.023 --> 31:37.634
I TOLD DR. ADAMS
HOW ANXIOUS I'VE BEEN,

31:37.634 --> 31:42.161
AND SHE SAID
THAT PANICKY MOTHERS
EXPECTING THE WORST,

31:42.161 --> 31:45.207
THEY CAN ACTUALLY
MAKE IT MORE LIKELY.

31:45.207 --> 31:48.558
SO SHE TOLD ME TO JUST
TRUST WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN
WILL HAPPEN,

31:48.558 --> 31:52.736
YOU KNOW,
JUST HAVE SOME FAITH.

32:04.052 --> 32:05.880
I WISH HE WOULD
GET IN HERE.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.013
I FEEL LIKE
I'M ON DEATH ROW.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.058
DON'T WORRY, WILL.

32:10.058 --> 32:12.104
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.764
SO...

32:20.764 --> 32:23.898
LET'S GET TO IT.

32:23.898 --> 32:26.727
I ALWAYS START MY INTERVIEWS
WITH THE SAME QUESTION.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.947
IT'S KIND OF A NICE WAY
TO EASE IN.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.690
HOW DID YOU TWO
FALL IN LOVE?

32:37.303 --> 32:40.697
THAT'S, UH...WOW.

32:42.612 --> 32:45.050
UH, QUITE A QUESTION.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.225
WELL, EH...

32:46.225 --> 32:47.356
UM...

32:47.356 --> 32:50.577
IT WAS, UH...

32:50.577 --> 32:53.493
HERE. LET ME.

32:55.190 --> 32:58.280
WELL, IT'S KIND OF
A WEIRD SITUATION.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.934
WE WERE SORT OF SET UP.

32:59.934 --> 33:03.982
IN FACT, SHE WAS
SEEING SOMEONE
WHEN WE MET.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.809
BUT, UH,
THE MORE WE HUNG OUT,

33:05.809 --> 33:09.117
THE HARDER IT WAS
NOT TO REALIZE THAT...

33:10.814 --> 33:14.166
THIS WOMAN IS AMAZING.

33:14.166 --> 33:19.301
NO, SHE'S BRILLIANT
AND BEAUTIFUL,

33:19.301 --> 33:21.434
SWEET AND ROMANTIC.

33:27.527 --> 33:30.138
ANYWAY, THERE WAS THIS...

33:30.138 --> 33:31.748
THING THAT I WAS
NERVOUS ABOUT.

33:31.748 --> 33:34.142
THIS TEST,
YOU MIGHT CALL IT,

33:34.142 --> 33:35.361
AT WORK.

33:35.361 --> 33:39.756
AND I WAS--I WAS
SO SHAKY THIS ONE TIME

33:39.756 --> 33:43.195
THAT I CUT MY HAND.

33:43.195 --> 33:46.154
AND THE WHOLE TIME
THAT SHE WORKED ON ME,

33:46.154 --> 33:48.765
YOU KNOW, FIXING ME UP,

33:48.765 --> 33:51.725
SHE KEPT TELLING ME
THAT SHE WASN'T WORRIED.

33:53.553 --> 33:55.250
THAT SHE BELIEVED IN ME.

33:58.558 --> 34:00.603
AND THE WAY
THAT SHE SAID IT,

34:00.603 --> 34:03.563
YOU KNOW,
THE LOOK IN HER EYES,

34:05.782 --> 34:09.351
I COULD--I COULD
SEE MYSELF THERE.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.570
YOU KNOW?

34:12.093 --> 34:17.142
AND THE ME THAT
I SAW IN HER EYES...

34:18.708 --> 34:21.320
I NEVER SAW MYSELF
THAT WAY BEFORE.

34:23.017 --> 34:26.890
I MEAN, SHE MADE ME
FEEL LIKE THIS GUY,

34:26.890 --> 34:31.069
YOU KNOW,
IT WAS THIS GUY THAT
I SO WANT TO BE.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.261
HEY.

34:49.261 --> 34:50.523
HEY.

34:50.523 --> 34:51.959
WAIT, DON'T.

34:54.570 --> 34:57.138
TODD, I JUST, UM,

34:57.138 --> 34:59.880
I CAME HERE
TO APOLOGIZE.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.969
ABOUT BEFORE.

35:01.969 --> 35:04.754
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
REALLY.

35:04.754 --> 35:06.408
IT WAS MY FAULT.
I MEAN, I SHOULD'VE--

35:06.408 --> 35:08.018
NO, YOU
SHOULDN'T'VE.

35:09.455 --> 35:11.283
I SHOULDN'T'VE.

35:12.980 --> 35:15.461
IT'S JUST...

35:15.461 --> 35:19.291
UM, SEE,
MY PARENTS USED TO
SAY IT ALL THE TIME,

35:19.291 --> 35:22.032
UM, TO US
AND TO EACH OTHER.

35:22.032 --> 35:25.123
JUST "I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU."

35:25.123 --> 35:27.516
RIGHT UP UNTIL
THE TIME I FOUND OUT

35:27.516 --> 35:30.128
THEY WERE BOTH HAVING AFFAIRS
AND GOT A DIVORCE.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.131
SO, I JUST DIDN'T
SAY IT MUCH AFTER THAT.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.569
I FIGURED IT REALLY
DIDN'T MEAN MUCH.

35:36.569 --> 35:39.137
BUT I FEEL IT.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.274
THIS IS FOR YOU.

35:46.274 --> 35:49.799
HERE. I HAD A COPY
MADE THIS MORNING.

35:54.935 --> 35:56.806
LET'S GO FOR A RIDE.

35:57.894 --> 35:59.505
YOU'RE DRIVING.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.647
I GOT YOUR CALL.

36:11.647 --> 36:14.650
UM, I WANTED TO PICK UP
MY LAST CHECK,

36:14.650 --> 36:16.478
AND THEN I NEED TO
GET HOME FOR DINNER.

36:16.478 --> 36:19.829
YEAH, YEAH, WE CAN
GET THAT FOR YOU.

36:19.829 --> 36:22.180
BUT, UH...

36:24.007 --> 36:26.184
I WANTED TO SAY
SOMETHING FIRST.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.143
I'LL GET OUT
OF YOUR WAY.

36:29.143 --> 36:30.797
NO, NO, IT'S OK.

36:30.797 --> 36:32.842
YOU CAN STAY.

36:32.842 --> 36:35.018
I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW
HOW THINGS WENT TODAY.

36:35.018 --> 36:38.761
UH, THEY TRIED
DOUBLING UP LIKE
I TOLD THEM TO,

36:38.761 --> 36:42.809
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

36:42.809 --> 36:44.114
WELL, HALFWAY.

36:44.114 --> 36:45.812
THEY WERE FASTER
AT SOME STATIONS

36:45.812 --> 36:50.208
AND SLOWER AT OTHERS,
SO WE GOT ALL MIXED UP.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.296
YEAH?

36:51.296 --> 36:54.255
I LET SID RUN THE LINE
FOR THE DAY.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.562
SID'S GOOD.
YEAH.

36:56.562 --> 37:00.218
BUT HE'S NOT
AS GOOD AS YOU.

37:00.218 --> 37:04.483
AND THE PROCESS,
IT STILL NEEDS
A LOT OF WORK.

37:04.483 --> 37:06.659
LISTEN, CHARLIE,
I'M SORRY THAT

37:06.659 --> 37:08.051
I SOUNDED OFF
LIKE I DID.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.706
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW,

37:10.706 --> 37:13.187
IF YOU'RE ASKING ME
NOT TO QUIT,
I STILL--

37:13.187 --> 37:16.625
LOOK, I'M NEW
AT THIS, TOO.

37:16.625 --> 37:19.454
AND THE TRUTH IS,
IF I PUSHED YOU TO QUIT
WITH WHATEVER I DID,

37:19.454 --> 37:21.369
THEN I MADE A MISTAKE.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.635
I MEAN, I'LL--I MIGHT
GIVE YOU SOME BAD IDEAS,

37:26.635 --> 37:27.984
BUT I MIGHT GIVE YOU
SOME GOOD ONES, TOO.

37:27.984 --> 37:32.380
SO...JUST TRY
TRUSTING ME A LITTLE.

37:32.380 --> 37:36.732
AND, UH, I'LL TRY
TRUSTING YOU, TOO.

THERE YOU ARE.

37:53.053 --> 37:54.054
I WAS GETTING WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

37:54.054 --> 37:55.229
I GOT
AN AIRPORT SHUTTLE

37:55.229 --> 37:56.709
MEETING US HERE
ANY MINUTE.

37:56.709 --> 37:58.580

WHERE'S YOUR BAG?

37:58.580 --> 37:59.929
OH, YOU DIDN'T LEAVE IT
DOWNSTAIRS, DID YOU?

37:59.929 --> 38:02.062
'CAUSE THE NEIGHBORHOOD
LOVES AN UNATTENDED BAG.

38:02.062 --> 38:04.151

GOING WITH YOU.

38:11.114 --> 38:12.420
NO, JULIA--

38:12.420 --> 38:15.597
I WANT TO.
I REALLY DO.

38:15.597 --> 38:18.557
AND SAN MIGUEL
SOUNDS SO PERFECT.

38:18.557 --> 38:21.037
YOU KNOW, THE CITY
AND THE INSTITUTE

38:21.037 --> 38:24.476
AND--AND YOU.

38:26.826 --> 38:28.088
I WOULD LOVE
TO BE ABLE

38:28.088 --> 38:30.438
TO JUST PACK UP
MY BAGS AND GO,
BUT MY FAMILY--

38:30.438 --> 38:31.657
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

38:31.657 --> 38:33.223
THEY'RE GOING
THROUGH ALL THIS
STUFF RIGHT NOW.

38:33.223 --> 38:34.834
AND THEY WILL BE.

38:34.834 --> 38:38.751

OWE IT TO THEM
NEVER TO LEAVE.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.970
NO, I KNOW THAT.
UM...

38:43.103 --> 38:45.540
ACTUALLY, THIS
ISN'T ABOUT THEM
NEEDING ME.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.326
THIS IS--
THIS IS ABOUT ME
NEEDING THEM.

38:52.460 --> 38:55.071
THEY'RE SO AMAZING,
ADAM, MY FAMILY.

38:55.071 --> 38:58.336
I MEAN, THEY ARE
ALL SO BRAVE.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.773
AND I GET STUFF
FROM THEM

39:00.773 --> 39:03.297
THAT I DON'T
EVEN REALIZE
HALF THE TIME.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.301
LIKE BEING ABLE
TO SAY THIS TO YOU

39:07.301 --> 39:09.564
WHEN I KNOW THAT
YOU THINK I'M TAKING

39:09.564 --> 39:11.087
A HUGE STEP
BACKWARDS.

39:11.087 --> 39:14.961
NO. NO, I DON'T.

39:17.529 --> 39:20.227
WELL, AS LONG AS IT'S
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.230
I'M SORRY.

39:25.537 --> 39:26.842
IT'S OK.

39:37.766 --> 39:40.378
GONNA MISS YOU SO MUCH.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.425
I'M GONNA MISS YOU,
TOO.

Holly: HEY, BAILEY.

39:59.614 --> 40:02.312
HEY.
HOW'D IT GO?

40:02.312 --> 40:04.445
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

40:04.445 --> 40:05.664
WASN'T IT, WILL?

40:05.664 --> 40:06.665
YEAH.

40:06.665 --> 40:08.101
I WAS SO PROUD
OF HIM.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.537
HE ACTUALLY MADE
THIS GUY BELIEVE

40:09.537 --> 40:11.321
THAT HE WAS MADLY
IN LOVE WITH ME.

40:11.321 --> 40:13.846
KIND OF HAD ME
GOING, TOO.

40:13.846 --> 40:16.065
GO ON, TELL HIM.

40:16.065 --> 40:18.285
I THINK
HE BOUGHT IT, YEAH.

40:18.285 --> 40:20.592
YEAH,
HE'S BEING BASHFUL.

40:20.592 --> 40:22.985
TRULY BRILLIANT.

40:22.985 --> 40:25.205
UM, YOU KNOW,
I'M KIND OF THIRSTY.

40:25.205 --> 40:26.946
UM, BE RIGHT BACK.

40:34.823 --> 40:36.999
SO WHAT NOW?

40:36.999 --> 40:41.221
I'M...NOT SURE.

40:41.221 --> 40:43.528
