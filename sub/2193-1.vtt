were gonna get away.

01:55.116 --> 01:59.854
You know I want to. I can't.
Maybe in a couple years.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.690
You're not gonna be
thankful when you're 50

02:01.790 --> 02:03.616
and wasting your life in a cubicle.

(LAUGHS) All right, badass.

02:16.104 --> 02:18.456
Come on, you're the only
thing keeping me here.

losing the rat race.

03:20.869 --> 03:23.605
And what about the mortgage?

03:23.705 --> 03:25.899
I just refinanced.

03:25.999 --> 03:27.817
And I have my student loans.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.278
You know how important this job is.

INTERVIEWER: Our first question...

03:34.340 --> 03:37.919
Look it. Your real love's here.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.455
You can box with him.

03:40.555 --> 03:42.791
And we want jobs here in America.

03:42.891 --> 03:46.002
You know he's the 38th
richest man in the world?

03:46.102 --> 03:49.297
Yeah, well, if that's rich,
then I don't want to be rich.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.465
Will you stop?

03:50.565 --> 03:52.091
...really hard to get it down,

03:52.191 --> 03:55.845
but our companies are
making huge profits.

03:55.945 --> 03:59.065
And which have you become,
ignorant or apathetic?

04:06.623 --> 04:08.233
but maybe even a three quarter...

04:08.333 --> 04:10.318
Oh, come on.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.703
It was a joke.

04:14.589 --> 04:16.574
A good one.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.992
(SIGHS)

04:18.091 --> 04:20.577
People trust our company
and what we do.

04:20.678 --> 04:23.623
And I just hope that I
can always live up to it.

04:23.723 --> 04:26.417
I believe I can because,
not knowingly,

04:26.517 --> 04:30.138
I have never, ever done
anything that's been dishonest.

04:54.879 --> 04:57.165
Left your key card on
your desk again, huh?

04:58.633 --> 05:00.493
I got you.

05:00.593 --> 05:02.078
Thanks.

05:02.178 --> 05:04.038
So, any plans for the 4th?

05:04.138 --> 05:06.875
No plans. I'm just gonna
enjoy the holiday weekend.

05:06.975 --> 05:08.877
Bet you can't wait
to get out of here.

05:08.977 --> 05:12.096
No, working the double shift.
I can use the holiday pay.

(BEEPS)

05:15.483 --> 05:16.885
Your kids all right?

05:16.985 --> 05:19.512
Yeah, they're fine.

05:19.612 --> 05:21.981
What's with the long face, then?

05:23.157 --> 05:25.359
- (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
- This is you.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.108
- There you go.
- Okay.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.493
If you need to talk, I'm here.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.886
What's wrong?

05:54.522 --> 05:56.807
Jane.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.264
Something terrible's happened.

06:03.364 --> 06:04.849
What?

06:04.949 --> 06:06.851
This can't be easy to hear,

06:06.951 --> 06:10.438
but they found Mike dead
this morning out front.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.323
What?

06:13.958 --> 06:15.743
How?

06:17.545 --> 06:19.747
Apparently suicide.

06:25.094 --> 06:27.421
He threw himself from
the top of the building.

06:28.473 --> 06:31.217
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.881
You okay? I'm so sorry, Jane.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.634
They already packed
all of Mike's stuff.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.922
I can't believe they moved so fast.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.016
What do you expect?

08:08.322 --> 08:10.516
Everyone.

08:10.616 --> 08:13.903
Can you gather around?

08:22.795 --> 08:25.907
As soon as I heard the
very distressing news,

08:26.007 --> 08:30.244
I wanted to be here in
person with you all

08:30.344 --> 08:32.455
at this very difficult time.

08:32.554 --> 08:37.085
We all have a huge hole
in our heart this morning.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.921
Especially me.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.890
Because not only was
Mike my employee...

08:45.651 --> 08:49.230
he was also my friend.

08:50.781 --> 08:53.101
We are like a family here

08:53.201 --> 08:55.937
and we must all stick together.

08:56.037 --> 08:59.482
As Winston Churchill said,

08:59.582 --> 09:02.985
"Success is not final.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.905
Failure is not fatal.

09:06.005 --> 09:10.751
It's the courage to
continue that counts."

09:11.802 --> 09:17.166
We will continue Mike's great work.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.218
God bless you all.

09:20.478 --> 09:23.506
God bless Mike.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.758
Jane, a word.

09:25.858 --> 09:28.102
Oh, of course.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.479
God.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.314
(SIGHS)

09:40.414 --> 09:43.075
How could a man...

09:46.420 --> 09:48.447
It's interesting, isn't it?

09:48.547 --> 09:51.325
This must have been the
last view that he had

09:51.425 --> 09:53.202
before he jumped off the building.

09:53.302 --> 09:55.496
Poor Mike.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.166
You knew him well, didn't you?

09:58.266 --> 10:00.376
Yes, sir.

10:00.476 --> 10:02.761
What was his mindset?

10:04.272 --> 10:06.507
That's just the thing.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.677
I never thought Mike would be
capable of something like this.

10:09.777 --> 10:13.272
Well, we never know
what we're capable of.

10:15.116 --> 10:18.352
You know, it seems to me, Jane,

10:18.452 --> 10:21.189
you are the ideal candidate

10:21.289 --> 10:23.816
to take over Mike's position.

10:23.916 --> 10:26.277
That hadn't even occurred to me.

10:26.377 --> 10:29.155
Oh, please, don't be coy with me.

10:29.255 --> 10:32.200
This is one great opportunity.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.077
Does that excite you?

10:35.177 --> 10:37.330
With all due respect, sir,

10:37.430 --> 10:40.666
it's difficult to be excited
about anything right now.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.710
Very well.

10:42.810 --> 10:47.014
Remember, time waits for no man.

Mike would have never...

12:13.067 --> 12:15.136
What can I do for you?

12:15.236 --> 12:20.107
Mike has some photos on his
desk of him and the kids.

12:21.033 --> 12:23.644
I just can't come to the
office and face everyone.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.272
Do you mind getting
them for me, please?

12:26.372 --> 12:28.316
I will grab every photo I see

12:28.416 --> 12:30.276
and make sure you get
them right away.

12:30.376 --> 12:33.787
I can bring them over to you,
too, if you want some company.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.784
Pam, if there's anything
else that we can do,

12:38.884 --> 12:41.454
me or Ray, please don't
hesitate to ask us.

12:41.554 --> 12:43.497

in here like that.

16:05.424 --> 16:08.702
I know, I'm sorry. I come in peace.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.463
You've got to eat, babe.

16:13.474 --> 16:16.001
- Jane.
- Thank you.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.053
I'll eat it.

16:24.193 --> 16:26.395
We have secrets between us now?

16:28.989 --> 16:30.816
You're learning the game.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.627
I didn't think he even liked Mike.

17:34.722 --> 17:36.707
If you think Taft or anybody here

17:36.807 --> 17:39.418
cares about anything but
their own job, you're nuts.

17:39.518 --> 17:42.346
I want his job and he
wants Gault's job.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.634
Did you know what
Mike was working on?

17:46.734 --> 17:49.470
- What he was into?
- Into?

17:49.570 --> 17:51.180
- Yeah.
- What was he into?

17:51.280 --> 17:54.107
What is it you think we
do here, cure cancer?

17:55.784 --> 17:59.071
I'm not quite sure what
you're getting at.

18:01.373 --> 18:02.908
What is he doing?

18:04.543 --> 18:07.821
Let me give you the same advice
I got when I started here.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.699
The only way a woman is gonna
get ahead in this boys' club

18:10.799 --> 18:14.578
is to keep her head down and be the
biggest bitch on the block, period.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.164
God, who said that?

18:17.264 --> 18:19.299
You did.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.433
My Lord.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.027
This doesn't make sense.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.246
Of all people...

18:52.132 --> 18:54.702
You don't think Mike
was the suicidal type?

18:54.802 --> 18:57.579
I don't know what
the suicidal type is,

18:57.679 --> 18:59.339
but it wasn't Mike.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.845
Then why'd he do it?

19:10.943 --> 19:14.021
I found this taped to the
bottom of Mike's desk.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.645
What is that?

19:21.745 --> 19:23.480
Financial data

19:23.580 --> 19:27.534
that implicates someone in this
company of major embezzlement.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.448
The large pension securities accounts
have been completely depleted.

19:32.548 --> 19:35.076
- The amount missing is staggering.
- Stop.

19:37.094 --> 19:39.621
I need you to double-check the files

19:39.721 --> 19:42.082
and be absolutely certain before
you make any accusations.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.751
I already have.

19:43.851 --> 19:46.178
But I'll do it again if you want.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.340
Jane, let's keep this between us.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.885
I don't need to tell you
how serious this is.

19:52.985 --> 19:55.103
What are we gonna do if it's true?

19:56.905 --> 20:00.142
If you have actually have something,

20:00.242 --> 20:02.694
there are procedures.

20:03.871 --> 20:07.324
We'll wait until the office is
empty and we'll call the SEC.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.243
Together.

20:11.879 --> 20:14.490
But I need the proof.

20:14.590 --> 20:15.791
Okay.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.795
I'll go get your proof.

21:11.146 --> 21:13.715
You're not bailing out on
happy hour again, are you?

21:13.815 --> 21:15.801
Oh.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.681
- Couple more hours.
- You need a drink.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.724
We all do.

21:22.824 --> 21:24.852
I can't.

21:24.952 --> 21:27.312
Can you babysit Ray
for me until I get there?

21:27.412 --> 21:30.691
Are you sure?
You've seen me when I drink.

21:30.791 --> 21:32.192

21:36.463 --> 21:39.116
I really can't come. I'm sorry.

21:39.216 --> 21:41.243
Okay, just call me

- You know, illegal.

24:30.011 --> 24:32.247
I'm always proud of you.

24:32.347 --> 24:34.708
I want to take care of you.

24:34.808 --> 24:37.594
I'm gonna be fine. I promise.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.547
Colleen's on her way over.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.974
Oh.

24:43.942 --> 24:45.969
Okay.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.263
I love you, Ray.

24:48.363 --> 24:50.148
RAY: I love you.

25:39.164 --> 25:40.907
- (COUGHS)
- Let's get this over with.

25:45.086 --> 25:48.156
- We need to see the surveillance room.
- Surveillance room?

25:48.256 --> 25:50.250
Anybody on duty besides you tonight?

25:51.343 --> 25:52.661
It's okay, Lamont. He's with me.

25:52.761 --> 25:55.004
Come on, Frank, let's go upstairs.
Let's not waste time here.

25:57.390 --> 25:58.917
Anybody else on duty tonight?

25:59.017 --> 26:01.253
No. Why do you ask?

26:01.353 --> 26:04.013
Let's go to the surveillance room.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.225
Thank you, Lamont.

26:12.447 --> 26:13.807
Right through here.

26:13.907 --> 26:17.227
Wow, look at this place. How long
you been with the company, Lamont?

26:17.327 --> 26:19.521
- Five years.
- Wow, five years.

26:19.621 --> 26:22.031
- All the latest gear, huh?
- Yup.

26:22.832 --> 26:25.735
- You got a family?
- Yeah, wife and two girls.

26:25.835 --> 26:29.322
Oh. Which ones are
the main video drives?

26:29.422 --> 26:31.158
These two.

26:31.258 --> 26:32.826
This one and this one?

26:32.926 --> 26:34.536
- Yes.
- How old are your girls?

26:34.636 --> 26:36.163
Four and six.

26:36.263 --> 26:39.082
- You got life insurance?
- Life insurance?

26:39.182 --> 26:42.427
I'm gonna need to pull these drives.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.404
Jane, this is Frank.

27:09.504 --> 27:13.033
He's one of our crisis managers
here to get us started internally.

27:13.133 --> 27:15.952
A pleasure. We need to
get out in front of this.

27:16.052 --> 27:17.954
These things tend to
accelerate if we don't.

27:18.054 --> 27:20.540
Just a brief interview until
the legal team gets here.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.842
Of course.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.353
Thank you.

27:35.613 --> 27:38.558
- What a view.
- Yeah.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.644
That's what the corner
office gets you.

27:40.744 --> 27:41.978
Yeah.

27:42.078 --> 27:44.013
I'll try to make this as
painless as possible.

27:44.113 --> 27:46.441
I need to get a very
clear understanding

27:46.541 --> 27:49.719
- of what it is you've observed.
- Of course.

27:49.919 --> 27:52.989
- Regulations, you understand.
- Okay.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.741
How long have you been
with the company?

27:54.841 --> 27:56.910
- Three years.
- Three years?

27:57.010 --> 28:00.789
And was Mike your
supervisor the entire time?

28:00.889 --> 28:04.376
Yes, but he was more
than a supervisor.

28:04.476 --> 28:07.420
He was a mentor.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.714
Kind of like a big brother.

28:09.814 --> 28:13.009
I can only imagine how
difficult this is for you.

28:13.109 --> 28:15.345
I'm so sorry.

28:15.445 --> 28:16.846
Okay, well, tell me
now what you found.

28:16.946 --> 28:19.349
Bullet points. We'll get
to the specifics later.

28:19.449 --> 28:21.401
Of course.

28:23.036 --> 28:24.271
It's not good.

28:24.371 --> 28:27.107
The transfers were made
to overseas accounts

28:27.207 --> 28:29.150
which were practically untraceable.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.777
Wow, those accounts
should have been under

28:30.877 --> 28:31.987
the direct governance
and control of...

28:32.087 --> 28:35.573
Someone who has full
access and authorization.

28:35.673 --> 28:38.576
Well, there can't be many
people on that list.

28:38.676 --> 28:40.837
Did you have a name?

28:41.971 --> 28:43.756
I do.

28:44.933 --> 28:47.093
Who is it?

28:48.728 --> 28:52.265
I can't say with absolute certainty.

28:53.942 --> 28:56.102
Who is it?

29:00.532 --> 29:02.108
It's Gault.

29:06.955 --> 29:08.281
Here.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.985
I've checked all the data thoroughly.

29:12.085 --> 29:14.321
He's the only one.

29:14.421 --> 29:16.039
Thaddeus Gault?

29:17.757 --> 29:19.876
The man who built the company?

29:20.927 --> 29:23.371
Yes.

29:23.471 --> 29:25.623
This is quite explosive, Jane.

29:25.723 --> 29:27.375
I know.

29:27.475 --> 29:29.169
I don't want to take
on a man like that.

29:29.269 --> 29:31.713
That's why you're here.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.256
That's right. That is why I'm here.

29:33.356 --> 29:35.342
But I need to know,
have you discussed this

29:35.442 --> 29:37.510
with anyone else since
making the report?

29:37.610 --> 29:40.305
Phoned anyone?
Received any phone calls?

29:40.405 --> 29:43.892
- Besides Taft, no.
- Are you sure?

29:43.992 --> 29:47.153
Yeah, I'm sure.

29:49.998 --> 29:53.860
Do you think that this may
have had something to do with

29:53.960 --> 29:59.123
your recently departed
colleague's demise?

30:00.300 --> 30:03.336
Yes, I think he's who uncovered it.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.177
Interesting.

30:16.983 --> 30:19.010
- I'm gonna use the restroom.
- Out of the question.

30:19.110 --> 30:20.512

30:20.612 --> 30:21.971
Well, I really need to go.

01:04:48.386 --> 01:04:49.704
and that's an actual fact.

01:04:49.804 --> 01:04:52.999
But that doesn't mean they won't
squish you real good if you get unlucky.

01:04:53.099 --> 01:04:56.169
Believe me, too many people do.
I have seen some things.

01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:59.005
Anyway, in the future when you
have a problem with an elevator,

01:04:59.105 --> 01:05:01.340
call a professional.
You might live longer, you know?

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.427
That's good advice, thanks.

01:05:04.527 --> 01:05:06.471
- Hello.
- Help!

01:05:06.571 --> 01:05:08.181
Hey, you know what?
Don't get her stirred up again.

01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:11.058
I finally got her calmed down.
She as kind of flipping out.

01:05:11.158 --> 01:05:13.186
You know, she got it in her
head I was trying to hurt her.

01:05:13.286 --> 01:05:15.855
- Can you believe that?
- I've seen it before. No problem.

01:05:15.955 --> 01:05:17.607
People, when they get
into closed spaces,

01:05:17.707 --> 01:05:20.242
sometimes they get a little crazy.
I'll just get her out.

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:26.199
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:05:26.299 --> 01:05:28.159
- What are you doing?
- I'm just gonna help you.

01:05:28.259 --> 01:05:31.704
Uh, yeah, don't.
This is what I do, Frank.

01:05:31.804 --> 01:05:33.539
When you get a license
to fix elevators,

01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:35.333
you can play around in
the shaft all you like.

01:05:35.433 --> 01:05:37.968
But until then, just,
you know, give me a break.

01:05:40.313 --> 01:05:43.382
Help! Please, get me out of here!

01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:45.343
Please, you've got to
get me out of here fast.

01:05:45.443 --> 01:05:47.520
- I'm going to go crazy.
- She's totally lost it.

01:05:49.155 --> 01:05:51.849
Uh, just take it easy, lady.
It's okay.

01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:53.643
We'll have you out in
just a second, all right?

01:05:53.743 --> 01:05:55.895
No, get me out of here now, please!

01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:58.064
I'm gonna go crazy in here.
Please, please.

01:05:58.164 --> 01:06:00.816
Get me out of here. This guy shot me.

01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:02.818
Shot you, ma'am?

01:06:02.918 --> 01:06:06.572
Yes, he shot me.
I have the gun in here.

01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:10.576
Okay, just relax, ma'am.
Nobody's trying to kill you.

01:06:10.676 --> 01:06:14.080
I promise I'm gonna have you
out of there in just a second.

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.590
If you just...

01:06:19.352 --> 01:06:20.795
Something wrong?

01:06:20.895 --> 01:06:22.630
Robert?

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:24.924
Uh, yeah.

01:06:25.024 --> 01:06:27.635
Looks like there's...
there's, like, a bunch of...

01:06:27.735 --> 01:06:30.312
dirt or something caked in here.

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:33.599
Get me out now!

01:06:33.699 --> 01:06:35.851
Oh, uh, yeah.

01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:37.311
I'll have you out in a second.

01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:41.282
Actually, I'm gonna have to grab
a screwdriver or something.

01:06:42.208 --> 01:06:43.492
No.

01:06:45.294 --> 01:06:46.988
No.

01:06:47.088 --> 01:06:48.489
No! No!

01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:51.041

- Huh?

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:19.830
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.548
Yeah.

01:08:22.975 --> 01:08:25.211
I'm assuming since
I'm still breathing

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:28.171
- that that gun is not loaded.
- No.

01:08:28.272 --> 01:08:29.881
Is he still out there?

01:08:29.982 --> 01:08:32.051
Yeah. What the hell is going on?

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:34.720
He's still out there. Did I call you?

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:36.180
No, no, no.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.974
He just did what everybody does when
someone is stuck in an elevator.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:42.019
They call a repairman.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.196
(EXHALES)

01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:49.868
Oh, wait. Wait, you are shot.

01:08:50.669 --> 01:08:51.779
Yeah, but I'm okay.

01:08:51.879 --> 01:08:53.613
Listen, we need to get out of
here before he comes back.

01:08:53.714 --> 01:08:56.075
Listen to me.
Where does that ladder go?

01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:58.202
It goes to the roof, but just relax.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:01.247
I closed the outer doors.
He can't even get into the shaft.

01:09:01.346 --> 01:09:02.540
He did before.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.917
Yeah, but before he had this.

01:09:05.017 --> 01:09:07.002
It's the building's elevator key.

01:09:07.102 --> 01:09:09.921
He can't get into the
elevators without it.

01:09:10.022 --> 01:09:12.591
This is the safest place.

01:09:12.691 --> 01:09:15.928

to wonder what's happened,

01:09:16.028 --> 01:09:17.263
she'll call someone.

01:09:17.363 --> 01:09:18.930
Can't he just get another key?

01:09:19.031 --> 01:09:21.267
There is no other key.
Not in this building anyway.

01:09:21.367 --> 01:09:24.854
How can you be sure of that?

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:26.988

Jane Porter,

01:09:48.978 --> 01:09:51.721

(EXHALES)

01:10:03.868 --> 01:10:06.312

01:10:06.412 --> 01:10:08.481
No.

01:10:08.581 --> 01:10:10.908

01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:13.619

01:10:15.796 --> 01:10:17.706
Okay.

01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:21.877
You pack a mean wallop, by the way.

01:10:23.095 --> 01:10:25.130
Sorry.

(EXHALES)

01:10:29.184 --> 01:10:31.504
Couldn't he just get a key
from another building?

01:10:31.604 --> 01:10:34.715
Uh-uh. Not all buildings
have the same elevator key.

01:10:34.815 --> 01:10:37.510
What's he gonna do,
break into every one on the block

01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:39.553
and risk more witnesses?

01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:41.230
I don't think so.

01:10:43.198 --> 01:10:45.651
Drink up.

01:10:52.583 --> 01:10:54.819
She'll be here.

01:10:54.919 --> 01:10:56.946
It's getting pretty late.

01:10:57.046 --> 01:10:58.705
I better go get her.

01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:29.562
Oh, hey, Jane. I will
bet you a million bucks

01:11:29.662 --> 01:11:31.864
that we are both gonna be fine.

01:11:33.207 --> 01:11:34.733

must be booming.

It's pretty good.

01:11:40.881 --> 01:11:43.033
It's honest work and it's steady.

for our kid to go to college.

You're right. You really are.

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:58.424
Yeah, I see people just
chasing more, you know?

01:11:58.524 --> 01:12:01.343
More stuff, more money, more power.

01:12:01.443 --> 01:12:04.096
Never satisfied.

01:12:04.196 --> 01:12:07.733

than we are right now.

Thank you, Mr. Robert Brown, Jr.

01:12:14.373 --> 01:12:16.491
What for?

01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:20.195
For rescuing me, of course.

01:12:20.295 --> 01:12:22.656
Well, we're not out of this box yet,

01:12:22.756 --> 01:12:25.701
but, yeah, we're gonna be fine.

01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:29.079
In fact, I will bet that guy is
probably a million miles away by now.

line of work.

01:18:33.668 --> 01:18:35.579
Are you okay?

01:18:45.263 --> 01:18:47.048
(THUDS)

01:18:52.729 --> 01:18:54.589
Are you okay?

01:18:54.689 --> 01:18:58.176
Yes. Take the elevator
down to the garage.

01:18:58.276 --> 01:18:59.845
What? Why?

01:18:59.945 --> 01:19:01.596
Ray!

01:19:01.696 --> 01:19:04.975
It's been a long night.
I just want to go home.

01:19:05.075 --> 01:19:07.694
RAY: Going down.

01:19:17.337 --> 01:19:19.247
No.

01:20:05.594 --> 01:20:07.837
Jane!

01:20:10.307 --> 01:20:12.125
Oh, my God! Baby!

01:20:12.225 --> 01:20:14.419
Baby, are you okay, huh?

01:20:14.519 --> 01:20:16.421
- Yeah.
- What's happening?

01:20:16.521 --> 01:20:18.757
- What...
- Don't worry, I'm okay.

01:20:18.857 --> 01:20:20.884
My God, what happened to you?

01:20:20.984 --> 01:20:22.886
What...

01:20:22.986 --> 01:20:24.930
what happened to you, baby?

01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:26.431
Oh, my God.

01:20:26.531 --> 01:20:28.850
I'll tell you everything.
Could we go home, please?

01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:30.894
Yes. Yeah.

01:20:30.994 --> 01:20:32.771
Okay.

01:20:32.871 --> 01:20:34.606
Oh, baby.

01:20:34.706 --> 01:20:36.700
JANE: I love you.

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.868
Your vitals all look really good.

01:20:46.968 --> 01:20:48.495
- That's good.
- Comfortable?

01:20:48.595 --> 01:20:51.456
All things considered, yeah.

01:20:51.556 --> 01:20:53.792
When do you thinks the earliest
I'll be able to get out of here?

01:20:53.892 --> 01:20:55.627
I'm gonna keep you overnight

01:20:55.727 --> 01:20:59.005
and if you're feeling well,
probably get you to work on Monday.

01:20:59.105 --> 01:21:01.466
- Babe.
- Hi.

01:21:01.566 --> 01:21:04.678
- I'm so glad you're okay.
- Hey. Thanks. I'm good.

01:21:04.778 --> 01:21:07.188
I'm okay. I love you.

01:21:08.156 --> 01:21:09.975
- Hey.
- What happened?

01:21:10.075 --> 01:21:11.810
What's up, man? How you doing?

01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:13.270
- Good.
- Happy birthday.

01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:14.980
Thank you.

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.815
Jane, oh.

01:21:16.915 --> 01:21:19.943
There was a woman on the
elevator with me named Jane.

01:21:20.043 --> 01:21:21.778
Yeah, she called and checked on you.

01:21:21.878 --> 01:21:24.372
- She okay?
- She's gonna be fine.

01:21:26.341 --> 01:21:27.784
I'll be back to check
on you in a little bit.

01:21:27.884 --> 01:21:30.044
Hi.

01:21:51.199 --> 01:21:53.151
Jane.

01:21:55.453 --> 01:21:57.022
Hi.

01:21:57.122 --> 01:21:59.608
Well, Jane, you look
surprised to see me.

01:21:59.708 --> 01:22:01.526
Pleasantly so, I hope.

01:22:01.626 --> 01:22:04.529
No, I knew I'd see you again.

01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:06.656
I just thought you'd be in handcuffs.

01:22:06.756 --> 01:22:09.034
Well, Jane, you know
how these things work.

01:22:09.134 --> 01:22:12.662
By the way, I've ordered a complete
and thorough investigation

01:22:12.762 --> 01:22:15.957
into this whole sorry affair.

01:22:16.057 --> 01:22:18.043
Don't insult me, Mr. Gault.

01:22:18.143 --> 01:22:20.045
I know what you've done

01:22:20.145 --> 01:22:21.880
and I'm not gonna let
you get away with it.

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:26.051
Jane, please don't be foolish.

01:22:26.151 --> 01:22:29.554
Pick your bets very carefully.

01:22:29.654 --> 01:22:32.516
You know, a wise man once said,

01:22:32.616 --> 01:22:36.019
"He who controls the
nation's money supply

01:22:36.119 --> 01:22:39.523
cares not who makes its laws."

01:22:39.623 --> 01:22:41.233
You're going to jail.

01:22:41.333 --> 01:22:42.817
And if I don't?

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:45.737
Do you think I'm going
to forget about you?

01:22:45.837 --> 01:22:49.741
I don't think you or I can afford
to forget about one another.

01:22:49.841 --> 01:22:52.619
Such a shame.

01:22:52.719 --> 01:22:55.872
You know, power would
have sat so beautifully

01:22:55.972 --> 01:22:58.458
on those elegant shoulders of yours.

01:22:58.558 --> 01:23:03.255
You would have been a strong,
extraordinary leader in business.

01:23:03.355 --> 01:23:07.642
But as it is, you've got
no sense of humor.

01:23:08.693 --> 01:23:12.730
Did you ever consider that
maybe you're not funny, sir?

01:23:14.199 --> 01:23:16.685
Oh...

01:23:16.785 --> 01:23:19.153
