WEBVTT

03:13.316 --> 03:16.402
The arrow which felled the boar...

03:16.569 --> 03:20.155
...belonged to Lord lchimonji.

03:20.740 --> 03:22.826
Drink to him!

03:33.461 --> 03:35.713
The wily old beast

03:35.880 --> 03:39.049
shot out right in front of me.

03:39.886 --> 03:43.847
My horse reared
before I could aim, off I fell.

03:46.975 --> 03:48.393
Father,

03:48.727 --> 03:51.688
shall we roast the boar?

03:52.855 --> 03:54.941
He was old.

03:55.108 --> 03:57.652
His hide is tough; it stinks.

03:57.818 --> 03:59.404
Indigestible.

04:02.908 --> 04:05.494
Like me, old Hidetora.

04:06.786 --> 04:07.872
Would you eat me?

04:08.414 --> 04:11.207
You'd stick in our throats.

04:11.457 --> 04:14.586
That's why I joined your hunt,

04:14.753 --> 04:17.798
to reinforce our friendship.

04:17.964 --> 04:19.341
I, too!

04:20.052 --> 04:21.803
I would cement the bonds

04:21.970 --> 04:25.183
between the houses
of lchimonji and Ayabe,

04:25.349 --> 04:28.102
I would marry my daughter

04:28.269 --> 04:30.897
to your son Saburo.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.441
Hold on!

04:32.815 --> 04:35.067
That's my own invention.

04:35.692 --> 04:39.363
Lord lchimonji,
the day is propitious.

04:39.823 --> 04:41.783
Give us your answer.

04:42.116 --> 04:45.870
Whom will you have for Saburo,

04:46.037 --> 04:49.290
my daughter or Lord Ayabe's?

04:52.751 --> 04:54.837
Not an easy choice.

04:55.213 --> 04:56.922
Two daughters

04:57.090 --> 04:58.757
for one son.

04:59.801 --> 05:03.762
A pity Jiro, my second son,
already has a wife.

05:14.107 --> 05:15.525
Kvoami!

05:15.816 --> 05:17.276
Entertain us!

05:56.399 --> 05:58.734
From the far mountain

06:00.236 --> 06:02.907
From the near mountain

06:03.407 --> 06:06.535
Who comes hippety-hopping

06:07.077 --> 06:10.791
Showing off his handsome ears?

06:18.464 --> 06:19.799
A hare!

06:23.886 --> 06:26.722
Only one hare, Kyoami?

06:27.181 --> 06:28.223
Two, I think.

06:29.725 --> 06:33.980
Hopping here,
to be eaten by Father.

06:34.815 --> 06:36.525
Saburo, that's rude!

06:37.693 --> 06:38.859
Hold your tongue!

07:02.719 --> 07:05.053
The Great Lord is tired.

07:06.638 --> 07:09.641
Let us withdraw until he wakes.

07:28.034 --> 07:31.539
This is unlike Father.
He only pretends to sleep.

07:32.374 --> 07:35.793
After Saburo's insult,
how else could he save face?

07:35.961 --> 07:38.547
All he did was hunt.

09:11.226 --> 09:13.186
In the old clays,

09:13.353 --> 09:18.732
he'd rout an army
and not be winded.

09:18.898 --> 09:21.444
It's impolite to our guests.

09:22.194 --> 09:24.114
Kyoami, wake him!

09:24.280 --> 09:25.448
Father worries me,

09:27.325 --> 09:29.785
he's barely snoring today.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.125
Father, what is it?

09:35.291 --> 09:36.333
Are you ill?

09:42.923 --> 09:44.717
A dream...

09:57.563 --> 09:59.274
I had a dream.

10:01.277 --> 10:03.695
I was in a strange land.

10:05.155 --> 10:07.073
A vast wilderness.

10:07.325 --> 10:11.286
I went on and on, but met no one.

10:12.330 --> 10:14.373
I called, I shouted,

10:14.540 --> 10:16.291
but no one answered.

10:19.462 --> 10:21.047
I was alone.

10:23.008 --> 10:26.178
Alone in the wide world.

10:28.679 --> 10:29.763
I felt a chill...

10:47.532 --> 10:49.283
Such stupidity!

10:49.993 --> 10:53.204
Tara's voice pulled me back.

10:54.245 --> 10:56.583
I saw my beloved children.

10:59.837 --> 11:01.504
Taro,

11:03.380 --> 11:04.841
<i>mo,</i>

11:06.719 --> 11:07.927
Saburo.

11:10.222 --> 11:13.392
Father, I've never seen you
like this.

11:13.726 --> 11:14.768
It's not right.

11:14.935 --> 11:17.145
Quiet, Saburo!

11:17.312 --> 11:20.440
Be thankful we have his affection.

11:20.691 --> 11:22.359
I'm puzzled, too.

11:22.525 --> 11:25.445
I can scarcely believe my ears.

11:26.029 --> 11:29.491
Normally, all he asks
is our obedience.

11:30.451 --> 11:32.329
That's affection enough.

11:35.249 --> 11:36.625
All right.

11:43.714 --> 11:45.799
I've been considering an idea,

11:46.258 --> 11:48.970
and I've reached a decision.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.515
I want to tell it to you.

11:53.642 --> 11:57.145
Now is a good time to do it

11:57.520 --> 11:59.522
while we have with us

11:59.688 --> 12:02.566
Lords Fujimaki and Ayabe.

12:06.195 --> 12:07.572
Bring them!

12:18.418 --> 12:21.046
I, Hidetora lchimonji,

12:24.550 --> 12:29.303
was born in that small castle
in the mountains.

12:30.929 --> 12:33.516
At that time, the entire plain

12:33.683 --> 12:36.436
seethed with constant battle.

12:36.602 --> 12:38.688
Many lords vied for power.

12:40.773 --> 12:43.609
At the age of seventeen,

12:45.527 --> 12:48.363
I flew my banner over that castle.

12:49.531 --> 12:52.160
I waged wars for fifty years,

12:54.119 --> 12:57.372
and at last the plain was mine.

12:59.875 --> 13:03.963
I hoisted my colours
over the main castle.

13:05.131 --> 13:06.717
I spent more years

13:06.926 --> 13:11.430
fighting lance to lance
with these two gentlemen.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.934
Now, the moment has come

13:15.101 --> 13:17.603
to stable the steeds of war

13:17.770 --> 13:20.355
and give free rein to peace.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.153
But old Hidetora

13:26.320 --> 13:28.532
is seventy years old.

13:35.956 --> 13:38.750
I hereby cede total authority

13:39.917 --> 13:42.294
over all my dominions

13:42.545 --> 13:44.046
to my eldest son Taro.

13:46.091 --> 13:47.925
My lord, this is so sudden...

13:49.136 --> 13:50.679
Not at all.

13:50.845 --> 13:54.350
I've thought long and hard.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.810
There comes a time

13:58.770 --> 14:00.648
to step aside,

14:00.814 --> 14:04.693
and pass on the reins
to younger hands.

14:05.069 --> 14:08.156
I say to you: that time is now!

14:08.322 --> 14:10.409
This is my will.

14:11.242 --> 14:15.538
Taro is now head of the lchimonjis,

14:15.704 --> 14:17.706
lord of this lands.

14:18.083 --> 14:22.085
I will quit the castle keep

14:22.252 --> 14:24.172
and move to the outer tower.

14:24.422 --> 14:27.175
I will retain a 30-man escort

14:27.342 --> 14:31.094
and give the title and insignia
of Great Lord.

14:31.804 --> 14:34.057
But the actual leadership

14:34.223 --> 14:36.559
lies entirely with Taro.

14:36.892 --> 14:39.979
I expect all of you to obey!

14:46.028 --> 14:47.488
I'll obey.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.158
But what about me and Saburo?

14:51.534 --> 14:54.661
What do you intend for us?

14:56.747 --> 14:59.499
I give you, Jiro and Saburo,

14:59.666 --> 15:01.710
the Second and Third castles

15:01.876 --> 15:04.046
with their attendant lands.

15:04.213 --> 15:06.340
You will support Taro

15:06.506 --> 15:08.800
in the First Castle.

15:10.760 --> 15:13.513
I shall be your guest

15:15.099 --> 15:17.934
visiting each castle in turn,

15:18.642 --> 15:20.729
living out my remaining years.

15:25.985 --> 15:29.072
How hard it is to be old!

15:30.739 --> 15:32.199
I would speak.

15:33.492 --> 15:35.369
I respect your wishes

15:35.535 --> 15:37.830
and appreciate your trust,

15:37.997 --> 15:40.082
but I beg you to reconsider.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.626
Why?

15:42.503 --> 15:44.213
Though I am your eldest son,

15:44.380 --> 15:46.840
I could never take your place.

15:47.007 --> 15:49.384
It is too great a task.

15:49.926 --> 15:52.721
I always pray to the God of War.

15:52.888 --> 15:55.015
"Let his life last 100 years,

15:55.181 --> 15:58.226
"even if it means
shaving a bit off mine."

15:58.684 --> 16:00.771
What a pretty speech.

16:01.062 --> 16:03.440
I cannot use such honeyed words.

16:04.108 --> 16:05.609
I'd be embarrassed.

16:09.030 --> 16:10.322
Don't be spiteful!

16:10.780 --> 16:14.786
You mean Taro only flatters me?

16:17.497 --> 16:19.708
Pay no attention to Saburo.

16:21.668 --> 16:25.296
I feel the same as Taro.

16:25.714 --> 16:28.925
We'd like nothing better
than to stay behind your shield.

16:29.092 --> 16:33.054
But it's our turn to shield you

16:33.220 --> 16:36.599
from life's bitter arrow.

16:38.434 --> 16:40.020
Well said, Jiro.

16:41.688 --> 16:43.522
Bring me that quiver!

16:58.579 --> 17:00.415
Break an arrow in two.

17:05.921 --> 17:07.548
Can you do it?

17:14.179 --> 17:15.638
Bundle them

17:16.888 --> 17:18.726
and try again.

17:34.783 --> 17:37.202
A single arrow is easily broken.

17:37.369 --> 17:39.954
Not so three together.

17:41.164 --> 17:45.418
Whenever Taro is in trouble,

17:45.585 --> 17:48.297
if you unite your forces,

17:48.464 --> 17:51.259
the house of lchimonji will be safe.

17:58.267 --> 18:00.186
Even in a sheaf,
three arrows can be broken.

18:08.485 --> 18:11.196
More of your pranks.

18:11.488 --> 18:12.657
Stop being foolish.

18:12.865 --> 18:16.577
It's you who are foolish.
Your plan is absurd.

18:17.453 --> 18:20.247
You are either senile or mad.

18:20.415 --> 18:21.665
Silence!

18:23.918 --> 18:26.085
Do not insult your father!

18:27.879 --> 18:30.090
What madness have I spoken?

18:30.465 --> 18:32.927
Wherein lies my senility?

18:33.093 --> 18:34.554
I'll tell you.

18:34.762 --> 18:38.309
What kind of world do we live in?

18:38.474 --> 18:42.019
One barren of loyalty and feeling.

18:42.312 --> 18:44.897
- I'm aware of that.
- So you should be!

18:45.065 --> 18:47.817
You spilled measureless blood.

18:47.984 --> 18:50.196
You showed no mercy, no pity.

18:51.404 --> 18:55.658
We too are children of this age,
weaned on strife and chaos.

18:56.076 --> 19:00.996
We are your sons,
yet you count on our fidelity.

19:01.164 --> 19:04.499
In my eyes, that makes you a fool.

19:04.666 --> 19:06.419
A senile old fool!

19:17.513 --> 19:18.931
So that's it!

19:20.390 --> 19:24.854
You mean one day,
you'll forget I'm your father.

19:25.020 --> 19:26.314
You'll betray me.

19:26.481 --> 19:28.234
More folly!

19:28.400 --> 19:30.445
Does a traitor betray himself?

19:30.611 --> 19:32.904
Then you mean your brothers?

19:33.071 --> 19:36.950
He's jealous of Taro's position.

19:37.117 --> 19:41.163
Is that why you slander me?

19:41.412 --> 19:43.956
Brother or not, watch your step!

19:45.041 --> 19:47.711
Your lesson of the three arrows
was wasted.

19:47.878 --> 19:50.672
The unity of the three sons
is split.

19:54.050 --> 19:57.971
You scorn your father's wishes?

19:58.138 --> 20:01.142
Parents and children
have no place in this world?

20:01.308 --> 20:04.353
Very well,
since you'll have it so,

20:04.520 --> 20:07.441
I cut the bonds between us!

20:08.026 --> 20:11.780
You are a stranger to me!
Out of my sight!

20:12.113 --> 20:13.157
You mustn't!

20:14.323 --> 20:15.866
Quiet, Tango.

20:17.536 --> 20:20.078
My mistake was to love him too well.

20:20.245 --> 20:22.498
I spoiled him.

20:23.248 --> 20:27.712
It's my fault, he's arrogant.

20:28.838 --> 20:30.923
But it's too late for regrets.

20:32.092 --> 20:33.842
When flesh is rotten,

20:34.260 --> 20:37.054
even our own cut it away!

20:37.263 --> 20:38.430
Wait, my lord!

20:38.597 --> 20:40.182
Master Saburo is blunt,

20:40.557 --> 20:43.561
perhaps even disrespectful.

20:43.770 --> 20:47.940
But his words are honest,
and come from the heart.

20:48.191 --> 20:51.235
Consider well:
you will find

20:51.444 --> 20:52.570
he is not wrong.

20:52.736 --> 20:53.736
Silence!

20:54.655 --> 20:55.655
I will speak.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.282
Begone!

20:57.534 --> 20:58.909
I will stay.

21:09.504 --> 21:11.172
You disobey me?

21:11.506 --> 21:14.384
My duty to you is to speak my mind.

21:14.593 --> 21:17.220
Brandish your sword, I won't move.

21:17.761 --> 21:21.015
Revoke that rash decision.

21:21.183 --> 21:23.059
Your insolence matches his!

21:23.226 --> 21:25.729
I will not have it!

21:25.896 --> 21:26.938
I banish you both!

21:27.105 --> 21:28.315
Father!

21:52.589 --> 21:54.132
What misery!

21:55.967 --> 21:58.553
What will you do, now?

21:58.721 --> 22:01.933
I grieve for Father, not myself.

22:02.601 --> 22:05.603
The horror ahead of him...

22:06.521 --> 22:09.023
Tango, you're an idiot.

22:10.107 --> 22:11.151
Why?

22:11.317 --> 22:14.069
For defending me
and being banished.

22:14.612 --> 22:17.156
Your place is with Father.

22:18.866 --> 22:20.827
He needs you.

22:35.135 --> 22:38.180
They're following us!

23:25.393 --> 23:26.812
Wait, son-in-law!

23:27.812 --> 23:30.064
Why do you run away?

23:30.231 --> 23:31.399
Son-in-law?

23:31.566 --> 23:33.109
Hear me out!

23:33.735 --> 23:37.280
You're in disgrace,
exiled from your lands.

23:37.573 --> 23:40.157
Lord Ayabe and I

23:40.324 --> 23:43.244
witnessed the whole incident.

23:44.996 --> 23:46.539
You are an outcast

23:46.706 --> 23:48.999
little more than a beggar.

23:49.541 --> 23:51.628
Forgive my rudeness.

23:51.794 --> 23:54.130
What I am trying to say...

23:54.297 --> 23:56.092
I can't find the words.

23:56.259 --> 23:57.385
The meaning is clear.

23:57.551 --> 23:59.512
No lord chooses a beggar
for his daughter.

23:59.679 --> 24:01.097
Of course not.

24:02.431 --> 24:04.767
No... Now hold on!

24:04.933 --> 24:09.313
Lord Ayabe rejected the marriage.

24:10.231 --> 24:14.069
But on my way home,

24:14.236 --> 24:16.363
I got a thinking

24:16.530 --> 24:20.449
of your extraordinary conduct.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.244
I like the way you spoke up.

24:23.412 --> 24:25.747
You have character and courage.

24:25.913 --> 24:27.248
You'd make a fine son-in-law.

24:27.414 --> 24:29.417
I retraced my steps,

24:30.168 --> 24:32.085
but you had gone.

24:32.837 --> 24:35.589
Does my offer interest you?

24:36.715 --> 24:37.927
How can I know?

24:38.094 --> 24:40.429
Then come stay with me

24:40.595 --> 24:42.723
while you think it's over.

24:44.099 --> 24:45.684
You too, Tango.

24:46.600 --> 24:49.145
You are honest and loyal.

24:49.563 --> 24:52.650
I can use you, will you come?

24:54.069 --> 24:57.030
Thank you for your generosity

24:58.156 --> 25:00.032
but I cannot accept.

25:02.827 --> 25:05.204
Whatever disguise I must adopt,

25:05.370 --> 25:07.998
I shan't abandon the Great Lord.

25:41.699 --> 25:42.743
What's going on?

25:42.950 --> 25:46.037
Hidetora's concubines are moving
from the castle.

25:46.204 --> 25:48.541
They block my lady's retinue.

25:49.124 --> 25:50.334
Scandalous!

25:51.460 --> 25:54.088
I am now the mistress here!

25:54.255 --> 25:56.507
They must make way!

26:30.582 --> 26:34.712
My women kneeling to Tara's wife?

26:40.635 --> 26:41.844
Intolerable!

26:43.054 --> 26:44.471
Why do you say that?

26:45.223 --> 26:48.059
You gave him the castle keep.

26:49.101 --> 26:50.895
It's only natural.

26:56.109 --> 26:59.821
Gives away his house
Gives away his land

26:59.988 --> 27:02.575
His bounty earns him a new title

27:03.867 --> 27:05.494
Lord of the rice fields

27:05.662 --> 27:07.704
A scarecrow!

27:10.874 --> 27:13.085
Call me a fool?

27:13.251 --> 27:16.089
No, the fool is me

27:16.380 --> 27:20.259
for serving as butt
to your laughing-stock.

27:20.426 --> 27:24.098
But you're another
for losing your keep.

27:42.449 --> 27:44.243
You know, Kaede,

27:46.828 --> 27:49.788
the view is more pleasant

27:49.955 --> 27:52.626
now that it is mine.

27:54.794 --> 27:56.463
As I recall,

27:57.171 --> 28:00.592
a banner used to hang there.

28:02.761 --> 28:04.222
Yes, Father's banner.

28:04.388 --> 28:06.892
Also his helmet and armour.

28:07.058 --> 28:08.183
Where are they?

28:08.351 --> 28:10.770
I gave them to Father's men.

28:12.521 --> 28:14.564
The armour doesn't matter.

28:15.274 --> 28:16.733
But the banner...

28:18.819 --> 28:20.196
My Lord,

28:20.530 --> 28:24.575
it belongs with the head
of the house of lchimonji.

28:25.951 --> 28:30.165
But Father is keeping
his title and insignia.

28:30.331 --> 28:33.250
Without them, you are a shadow.

28:36.254 --> 28:37.588
What do you mean?

28:37.755 --> 28:40.258
He made it clear

28:40.425 --> 28:43.009
that I am now in command.

28:44.594 --> 28:46.305
In that case,

28:46.471 --> 28:49.433
behave as if you are.

29:12.207 --> 29:14.627
You want the banner?

29:15.461 --> 29:18.422
Ridiculous!
You take back what you give.

29:19.465 --> 29:21.133
It is Lord Tara's order!

29:27.098 --> 29:30.557
See the lord,
a gourd in the wind

29:32.017 --> 29:34.187
Swinging this way...

29:34.645 --> 29:37.232
Swinging that way...

29:37.440 --> 29:40.194
Spinning as the breeze blows

29:40.820 --> 29:41.862
So high up...

29:42.070 --> 29:45.116
Dangling hollow from the tower

29:46.032 --> 29:47.408
Isn't it fun?

29:52.790 --> 29:56.044
Villain! I'll teach you!

30:26.073 --> 30:29.285
See the lord,
a gourd in the wind

30:31.413 --> 30:33.498
Swinging this way...

30:34.583 --> 30:36.834
Swinging that way...

30:37.711 --> 30:40.672
Spinning as the breeze blows

30:40.963 --> 30:42.174
So high up...

30:42.340 --> 30:45.967
Dangling hollow from the tower

30:46.511 --> 30:49.139
What fun, what fun!

30:53.226 --> 30:54.811
It's Ogura.

31:02.902 --> 31:04.277
I have a message.

31:04.445 --> 31:07.323
Lord Taro is holding
a family gathering

31:07.489 --> 31:10.618
to celebrate the transfer of power.

31:10.785 --> 31:13.496
He invites his honoured father.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.709
You too, Lord lkoma.

31:58.585 --> 32:02.007
Your "family gathering"
is only us?

32:04.675 --> 32:06.720
Please, father-in-law,

32:06.887 --> 32:09.180
won't you sit down?

32:12.058 --> 32:14.685
I am to sit below you?

32:15.394 --> 32:17.355
Who am I?

32:18.147 --> 32:20.858
The honourable father
of my husband.

32:21.567 --> 32:23.068
Is that all?

32:23.654 --> 32:27.115
And the Great Lord,
is he dead?

32:27.282 --> 32:28.449
Don't joke.

32:28.616 --> 32:30.201
I am not joking!

32:38.667 --> 32:42.838
I retain my title and my status.

32:43.047 --> 32:44.298
Have you forgotten?

32:44.506 --> 32:46.759
No, of course not.

32:47.054 --> 32:48.513
It's you who forget.

32:48.680 --> 32:52.975
You gave full authority to me.

32:53.934 --> 32:55.311
What do you want?

32:55.477 --> 32:58.229
I gave you this castle...

32:58.396 --> 33:01.358
I moved out, reduced my escort...

33:01.568 --> 33:05.947
They may be few in number,
but they're boisterous enough.

33:07.197 --> 33:09.659
What is that song?

33:20.753 --> 33:22.296
With such goings-on,

33:22.464 --> 33:25.007
how can I make myself obeyed?

33:25.174 --> 33:28.927
They are warriors,
unschooled in manners.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.555
They like comic songs.

33:31.763 --> 33:34.099
Comic songs can go too far!

33:34.267 --> 33:36.853
That song makes fun of me!

33:37.019 --> 33:40.023
My guard was defending my honour.

33:40.358 --> 33:44.028
Yet, you went ahead and killed him.

33:44.194 --> 33:46.490
I cannot allow that.

33:49.075 --> 33:51.661
This once, I'll overlook it.

33:52.036 --> 33:54.955
But I must have your promise

33:55.122 --> 33:57.626
that it won't happen again.

34:06.385 --> 34:08.219
You will sign this

34:09.387 --> 34:11.514
and seal it with your blood.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.029
"Pledge?"

34:25.862 --> 34:27.656
This is nonsense!

34:28.739 --> 34:30.117
Read it.

34:36.956 --> 34:38.501
"Pledge:

34:39.002 --> 34:40.503
"Firstly,

34:40.670 --> 34:44.422
"I cede to Taro Takatora
the domains of lchimonji.

34:44.589 --> 34:45.589
"Secondly,

34:46.174 --> 34:50.804
"I make him sole ruler
of the house of lchimonji.

34:51.471 --> 34:52.931
"Thirdly,

34:53.098 --> 34:55.726
"though I am Tara's father,

34:55.935 --> 35:00.355
"I shall submit to his authority
and act accordingly.

35:01.397 --> 35:04.443
"I swear by all the deities.

35:04.609 --> 35:07.236
"May they punish me if I disobey."

35:07.696 --> 35:10.865
I'm to seal it with my blood?
This silly thing?

35:14.579 --> 35:17.123
Everything it contains

35:17.290 --> 35:19.959
was proclaimed by you yourself

35:20.125 --> 35:22.253
before witnesses.

35:25.172 --> 35:28.175
What does it change
if you sign it?

36:14.891 --> 36:16.726
Are you a son?

36:17.101 --> 36:18.186
What do you mean?

36:18.353 --> 36:20.898
Is this a son's attitude?

36:22.899 --> 36:25.235
The hen pecks the cock

36:26.443 --> 36:28.820
and makes him a crow.

36:31.784 --> 36:33.618
I will not stay here.

36:36.204 --> 36:37.914
Fortunately,

36:39.082 --> 36:40.833
I have another son.

36:46.757 --> 36:49.217
Thank you, you did well.

37:27.505 --> 37:30.927
I was born and raised
in this castle.

37:32.803 --> 37:35.013
It belongs to my father.

37:35.723 --> 37:38.434
I left it to marry you.

37:41.436 --> 37:45.192
My father and brothers,
after the marriage,

37:45.360 --> 37:47.319
relaxed their vigilance.

37:48.904 --> 37:52.157
Hidetora murdered them.

37:58.287 --> 38:02.334
Now I am back
in my family castle.

38:05.420 --> 38:08.799
How I have longed for this day.

38:28.653 --> 38:30.196
Right there,

38:30.864 --> 38:33.283
my mother took her own life.

39:07.735 --> 39:09.654
Father is on his way.

39:12.113 --> 39:14.783
My brother sent him packing.

39:15.534 --> 39:17.662
He says Father grows eccentric...

39:17.828 --> 39:21.623
It would be unwise
to let him stay here.

39:22.292 --> 39:24.125
Father's counsellor, lkoma,

39:24.293 --> 39:27.213
is privy to my brother's plans.

39:44.230 --> 39:47.984
This severity is unlike Lord Taro.

39:49.944 --> 39:51.363
And you, my lord,

39:51.529 --> 39:53.990
why do you do nothing?

39:54.157 --> 39:55.534
He's right.

39:55.701 --> 39:59.621
You should succeed the Great Lord.

39:59.956 --> 40:03.208
Lord Taro is a weakling.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.629
The stake is large: gamble for it.

40:10.382 --> 40:14.512
Then you are willing
to gamble with me?

40:15.262 --> 40:16.471
Absolutely.

40:16.639 --> 40:19.683
Dogs turn on a master
who gives up the chase.

40:19.850 --> 40:22.394
Sounds the horn
or become the quarry.

40:23.312 --> 40:25.023
How the dogs howl!

40:29.110 --> 40:31.694
I must say, I find it unfair.

40:32.655 --> 40:35.491
Born twelve months after Taro,

40:35.659 --> 40:39.370
so all my life
I must grovel at his feet.

40:40.122 --> 40:41.623
Crack these bonds!

40:41.915 --> 40:43.918
Good for you, my lord!

40:44.208 --> 40:46.294
Don't lick your chops yet.

40:50.423 --> 40:52.342
Taro is easy pickings.

40:52.717 --> 40:56.221
His wife, Lady Kaede,
is another story.

40:57.181 --> 40:58.598
Quite true.

40:59.891 --> 41:02.894
She'd be a perfect match for you.

41:03.353 --> 41:04.729
Why not steal her?

41:05.104 --> 41:07.273
Don't be impertinent!

41:08.941 --> 41:11.652
First of all, there's Father.

41:12.153 --> 41:15.198
He still has thirty warriors.

41:15.950 --> 41:18.409
Each one is worth a thousand.

41:19.660 --> 41:23.206
He'll soon be here
and so will they.

41:25.209 --> 41:26.209
Any ideas?

41:32.925 --> 41:34.511
Open the gates!

41:35.511 --> 41:36.929
Hidetora is here!

42:11.922 --> 42:14.175
I will seek out Sué first.

42:14.676 --> 42:17.680
Tell Jiro I want to see him.

42:44.665 --> 42:46.042
Sué!

43:02.850 --> 43:05.853
<i>Praise be</i>

43:06.020 --> 43:10.693
<i>to the Eternal Western Paradise</i>

43:11.109 --> 43:15.530
<i>Praise be to the Eternal Buddha
in 36 trillion manifestations</i>

43:15.698 --> 43:22.369
<i>Praise be to Amida Buddha</i>

43:31.546 --> 43:33.256
I knew you'd be here.

43:33.423 --> 43:34.799
Father-in-law!

43:37.051 --> 43:39.055
Never mind the ceremony.

43:40.097 --> 43:42.100
It's been a long time.

43:43.517 --> 43:45.186
Let me look at you.

43:48.772 --> 43:51.444
Still the same sad face.

43:52.444 --> 43:55.614
When I see you,
it breaks my heart.

44:07.208 --> 44:09.461
It's worse when you smile.

44:12.631 --> 44:14.923
I burned down your castle,

44:15.091 --> 44:17.843
your father and mother perished.

44:19.929 --> 44:22.473
And you look at me like that!

44:24.392 --> 44:26.561
Look upon me with hatred.

44:26.728 --> 44:29.815
It would be easier to bear.

44:31.899 --> 44:34.777
Go on, hate me!

44:42.869 --> 44:44.789
I don't hate you.

44:47.582 --> 44:50.794
All is decided
in our previous lives.

44:51.878 --> 44:54.424
The Buddha embraces all things.

44:54.840 --> 44:56.508
Buddha again!

44:57.259 --> 44:59.179
He is gone from the evil world.

44:59.344 --> 45:01.306
His guardians are in exile,

45:01.472 --> 45:03.974
routed by the fury of Ashur.

45:04.600 --> 45:07.270
We can't rely on Buddha's mercy.

45:08.521 --> 45:10.565
There you are, Jiro.

45:11.190 --> 45:13.984
I've come to be your guest.

45:18.656 --> 45:20.908
I'm disappointed in Taro.

45:21.075 --> 45:22.118
I already know.

45:22.285 --> 45:25.830
It's all in my brother's letter.

45:27.165 --> 45:29.334
Taro wrote to you?

45:30.877 --> 45:33.087
He says your guards

45:33.254 --> 45:36.051
were unruly and vulgar.

45:36.217 --> 45:39.428
I am to receive you with courtesy.

45:39.595 --> 45:42.306
But I cannot let your warriors

45:42.473 --> 45:44.934
inside the castle walls.

45:45.102 --> 45:46.478
What's this?

45:48.020 --> 45:50.147
I'm to come alone,

45:50.314 --> 45:53.066
leaving my men to rot outside?

45:53.817 --> 45:56.361
My brother is the head of the clan.

45:56.528 --> 46:00.367
I have no choice but to obey him.

46:01.743 --> 46:04.245
If you dislike his conditions,

46:04.412 --> 46:07.288
then it might be best

46:07.456 --> 46:11.585
to go back and apologize.

46:13.505 --> 46:15.465
Apologize to Taro?

46:16.133 --> 46:18.218
Go back?

46:51.125 --> 46:52.502
Stop!

46:58.926 --> 47:00.385
Lord Kurogane!

47:00.637 --> 47:01.637
Lord Shirane!

47:02.429 --> 47:04.389
What does this mean?

47:07.267 --> 47:09.896
Lord lkoma!

47:11.272 --> 47:13.399
An order from Hidetora.

47:13.733 --> 47:15.194
"We arrived suddenly,

47:16.152 --> 47:18.196
"the castle is unprepared.

47:18.404 --> 47:22.491
"Withdraw and wait outside."

47:38.300 --> 47:40.678
Enough is enough,

47:41.345 --> 47:42.887
I understand.

47:47.309 --> 47:48.811
You too,

47:50.689 --> 47:52.691
you're just like Taro.

47:55.693 --> 47:57.695
You want to be rid of me.

47:57.862 --> 48:00.198
I'm too much trouble.

48:00.448 --> 48:02.158
That's not true.

48:02.450 --> 48:05.869
If you were alone,
I'd welcome you gladly.

48:06.036 --> 48:09.583
The Great Lord goes nowhere alone.

48:13.378 --> 48:15.755
You renounced your power.

48:16.046 --> 48:19.424
You have no need of an escort.

48:21.009 --> 48:23.928
Only the birds and the beasts

48:24.972 --> 48:27.307
live in solitude.

48:30.729 --> 48:33.064
I've heard enough excuses.

48:35.902 --> 48:37.652
Open the gates!

48:43.366 --> 48:44.826
You needn't worry.

48:45.743 --> 48:49.998
It's not for my men to enter,

48:50.165 --> 48:52.375
but for me to leave!

48:54.295 --> 48:56.045
Open the gates!

49:17.691 --> 49:19.444
Now close them!

49:23.658 --> 49:25.994
I will not see you again.

49:26.369 --> 49:27.788
Ever!

50:05.618 --> 50:07.912
The villages are deserted.

50:08.079 --> 50:11.749
Not a grain of rice anywhere.

50:11.916 --> 50:16.086
The peasants took everything
and fled to the mountains.

50:56.669 --> 50:58.087
My lord!

50:59.965 --> 51:02.802
We must go to the Third Castle.

51:03.343 --> 51:04.886
It was your first victory.

51:05.054 --> 51:08.347
Go back where you started...

51:08.514 --> 51:10.058
No, lkoma!

51:10.349 --> 51:11.976
If I could do that,

51:13.311 --> 51:16.230
would I roam the plain hungry?

51:17.898 --> 51:19.693
Use your head!

51:20.777 --> 51:24.447
What kind of welcome would I get,

51:25.323 --> 51:28.409
I, who banished
the lord of the castle?

52:10.579 --> 52:12.914
By order of Lord Taro Takatora,

52:13.081 --> 52:16.001
head of the lchimonji clan,

52:16.167 --> 52:20.047
I take possession of this castle.

52:21.840 --> 52:23.510
Open the gates!

52:40.902 --> 52:43.030
Without our master, Saburo,

52:43.197 --> 52:45.407
the castle is nothing to us.

52:45.615 --> 52:47.701
We leave it to you.

52:47.868 --> 52:51.663
We will follow him and die for him.

52:52.330 --> 52:56.043
We hear he is with us,
Lord Fujimaki.

52:57.420 --> 52:59.629
We go to join him.

53:55.145 --> 53:56.563
It's Tango!

53:59.817 --> 54:02.487
I have rice, bean curd, plums...

54:10.245 --> 54:11.622
I followed you

54:12.331 --> 54:14.540
and saw how you suffered.

54:14.707 --> 54:19.879
Though banished,
I am still your loyal vassal.

54:35.354 --> 54:36.897
Is it really Tango?

54:39.941 --> 54:41.317
Hold on!

54:41.692 --> 54:44.195
Don't take charity from peasants.

54:44.988 --> 54:47.824
A samurai will starve
rather than beg.

54:55.207 --> 54:57.418
The peasants are presumptuous.

54:57.583 --> 55:00.921
Burn their villages!

55:03.382 --> 55:04.758
Wait, my lord!

55:05.051 --> 55:07.428
Don't blame the peasants.

55:08.055 --> 55:11.431
Rather than disobey Tara's decree,
they fled.

55:16.227 --> 55:17.938
What decree?

55:18.564 --> 55:20.690
That you are banished.

55:20.856 --> 55:23.818
Anyone who helps you...

55:25.029 --> 55:26.405
will die.

56:07.489 --> 56:09.534
Now I understand.

56:10.869 --> 56:13.245
You tried to warn me of this.

56:19.710 --> 56:21.630
Laugh, Tango.

56:23.757 --> 56:26.010
Wretched Hidetora

56:29.138 --> 56:31.597
rejected by his children,

56:32.181 --> 56:34.601
driven from his castles,

56:35.934 --> 56:37.687
with no place to go.

56:37.854 --> 56:41.400
You have a place to go, my lord.

56:41.566 --> 56:43.319
Master Saburo

56:43.486 --> 56:47.071
has found refuge with Lord Fujimaki.

56:47.406 --> 56:49.158
Go to him.

56:50.575 --> 56:52.869
No, I can't.

56:55.371 --> 56:59.668
How could I ever face him?

57:00.085 --> 57:02.546
Listen to me!

57:03.838 --> 57:07.509
All Saburo wants
is your welfare.

57:08.509 --> 57:11.138
If I'm disguised like this,

57:11.304 --> 57:13.891
if I followed you so far,

57:14.058 --> 57:16.852
it's all thanks to him.

57:17.186 --> 57:20.399
He sent me to protect you.

57:53.138 --> 57:54.348
I have news.

57:54.514 --> 57:57.685
Saburo's men gave up the castle.

57:57.852 --> 58:00.731
They went to join Lord Fujimaki.

58:03.942 --> 58:06.987
Now Fujimaki's plot is clear.

58:07.780 --> 58:10.281
First, he takes Saburo,

58:10.490 --> 58:12.493
then Saburo's warriors,

58:12.659 --> 58:14.703
then the lordship himself.

58:14.870 --> 58:18.207
The lchimonjis battle each other.

58:18.875 --> 58:21.376
And he walks off with your land.

58:21.543 --> 58:22.836
That's a lie!

58:23.004 --> 58:25.046
He's not that kind of man!

58:25.214 --> 58:28.425
We must go to the Third Castle!

58:32.179 --> 58:34.891
But Taro's general has taken it!

58:35.558 --> 58:37.560
Ogura? He won't touch us.

58:39.561 --> 58:41.398
What do I smell?

58:41.564 --> 58:43.565
A very fishy stink!

58:45.275 --> 58:47.988
Ogura has only a few men.

58:48.530 --> 58:51.033
We can beat them easily.

58:51.783 --> 58:53.160
My horse!

58:55.079 --> 58:56.622
That's it, hurry!

58:56.830 --> 59:00.583
"Hell is ever at hand,
which you cannot say of Heaven."

59:02.377 --> 59:04.713
Stay behind if you're afraid!

59:20.187 --> 59:21.771
And yet,

59:23.774 --> 59:27.069
all we did was tell the truth.

01:01:27.903 --> 01:01:29.321
The enemy...

01:01:29.487 --> 01:01:32.781
I know!
Call lkoma and Ogura!

01:01:32.949 --> 01:01:35.367
It's a trap; they tricked us!

01:01:35.534 --> 01:01:39.621
We're surrounded, overwhelmed!

01:01:40.747 --> 01:01:42.624
We truly are in Hell!

01:08:06.685 --> 01:08:08.479
Lord Taro is slain.

01:08:09.188 --> 01:08:10.231
What?

01:08:10.397 --> 01:08:11.940
So be it!

01:08:12.358 --> 01:08:14.442
A stray shot from the tower.

01:08:26.956 --> 01:08:28.750
The fortunes of war.

01:08:29.416 --> 01:08:31.961
The fates are kinder to you.

01:08:37.133 --> 01:08:38.551
And Father?

01:08:39.386 --> 01:08:41.471
He'll commit seppuku.

01:10:00.136 --> 01:10:01.470
We are lost!

01:10:01.637 --> 01:10:03.014
Prepare yourself.

01:10:03.848 --> 01:10:05.224
Farewell, my lord.

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:30.395
Go back!

01:14:35.168 --> 01:14:36.587
<i>Lord mo'.!</i>

01:14:37.754 --> 01:14:40.257
The die is cast; do not falter.

01:14:40.423 --> 01:14:42.926
You chose this path, follow it.

01:14:43.676 --> 01:14:46.638
It leads to absolute rulership.

01:14:46.805 --> 01:14:49.598
You can no longer turn back.

01:16:43.215 --> 01:16:44.884
Is he mad?

01:16:45.885 --> 01:16:47.261
And better off for it.

01:16:47.427 --> 01:16:49.055
What do you mean?

01:16:49.471 --> 01:16:52.683
Please, my lord,
come to your wits!

01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:56.313
In a mad world,
only the mad are sane.

01:17:12.330 --> 01:17:14.165
What do you see?

01:17:15.832 --> 01:17:17.460
Forgive me!

01:17:20.504 --> 01:17:22.006
Oh, excellent!

01:17:22.173 --> 01:17:25.467
The failed mind
sees the heart's failings.

01:17:28.721 --> 01:17:31.433
The wonder of it!

01:17:32.184 --> 01:17:35.728
I see on this withered plain

01:17:36.145 --> 01:17:39.273
All those I destroyed

01:17:40.106 --> 01:17:42.861
A phantom army

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:49.576
One by one, they come floating

01:17:50.661 --> 01:17:52.996
Rising before me

01:18:10.013 --> 01:18:11.556
Who's there?

01:18:11.932 --> 01:18:15.310
Travellers stranded by the storm.

01:18:15.768 --> 01:18:17.686
Let us stay the night.

01:18:19.939 --> 01:18:23.234
My house is too poor for visitors.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.403
We ask nothing special.

01:18:27.239 --> 01:18:30.826
I'm sorry, I must be alone.

01:18:31.493 --> 01:18:34.287
Why? Are you diseased?

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.623
No.

01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:38.666
Then let us in.

01:18:39.376 --> 01:18:41.087
I cannot.

01:18:42.714 --> 01:18:45.842
The one who seeks shelter

01:18:46.009 --> 01:18:48.345
is the Great Lord himself.

01:18:54.558 --> 01:18:56.144
We're coming in.

01:19:19.084 --> 01:19:22.506
Our Lord was taken ill.
He is wet through.

01:19:25.634 --> 01:19:29.095
Bring something to cover him.

01:20:01.044 --> 01:20:02.462
I'm cold...

01:20:12.263 --> 01:20:13.806
Tango...

01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:17.268
He is himself again.

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:21.106
More's the pity.

01:20:21.607 --> 01:20:23.399
He is better off mad.

01:20:29.404 --> 01:20:31.032
Listen to me.

01:20:33.201 --> 01:20:35.202
I, Hidetora,

01:20:36.954 --> 01:20:39.249
was attacked by my own sons.

01:20:39.415 --> 01:20:41.626
I was betrayed by my vassal.

01:20:45.338 --> 01:20:47.632
That's not the worst.

01:20:50.885 --> 01:20:52.971
Because of me,

01:20:56.142 --> 01:21:00.438
my loyal men
died a useless death.

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:04.527
As fate would have it,

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:08.071
only I survived,

01:21:08.907 --> 01:21:11.074
I, who should have died.

01:21:23.754 --> 01:21:25.673
You there! Woman!

01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:31.553
I am not a woman.

01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:36.058
It's so dark, bring the light.

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:38.518
I have no light.

01:21:39.521 --> 01:21:41.981
I have no need of one.

01:21:43.983 --> 01:21:46.026
Are your eyes so poor?

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:18.766
Are you Lady Sué's brother,

01:22:19.141 --> 01:22:21.311
young Lord Tsurumaru?

01:22:27.692 --> 01:22:29.361
Tsurumaru?

01:22:34.701 --> 01:22:37.160
It's been a long time,

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:40.456
Lord Hidetora.

01:22:43.501 --> 01:22:45.878
You remember me?

01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:49.256
How could I forget you?

01:22:51.509 --> 01:22:53.344
I was only a boy.

01:22:53.761 --> 01:22:56.472
But, could I forget the man

01:22:56.639 --> 01:22:58.807
who burned down our castle?

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.475
Who, in exchange for my life,

01:23:03.062 --> 01:23:05.481
gouged out my eyes?

01:23:08.526 --> 01:23:10.945
I try to be like my sister.

01:23:11.531 --> 01:23:13.533
To pray Buddha,

01:23:13.698 --> 01:23:16.912
and rid myself of hatred.

01:23:20.164 --> 01:23:22.834
But not one clay I do forget!

01:23:24.919 --> 01:23:28.173
Not one night do I sleep in peace!

01:23:38.183 --> 01:23:42.770
I regret I cannot welcome you

01:23:42.936 --> 01:23:45.315
as befits the Great Lord.

01:23:46.190 --> 01:23:50.570
Luckily...
my sister gave me a flute.

01:23:56.409 --> 01:23:58.577
I will play for you.

01:23:59.495 --> 01:24:01.664
Lacking everything else,

01:24:01.831 --> 01:24:05.586
I give you hospitality of the heart.

01:24:08.715 --> 01:24:11.007
It is the only pleasure

01:24:12.508 --> 01:24:14.261
left to me.

01:25:44.271 --> 01:25:45.439
Sister-in-law,

01:25:45.772 --> 01:25:47.691
here is my brother's hair.

01:25:57.450 --> 01:26:00.912
He died in the battle.

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:03.582
Unfortunately, it falls on me

01:26:04.373 --> 01:26:06.334
to bring this unhappy news.

01:26:09.503 --> 01:26:10.879
Ogura...

01:26:12.673 --> 01:26:15.175
Where is my husband's body?

01:26:16.553 --> 01:26:18.261
In this heat,

01:26:18.763 --> 01:26:22.266
it was too unsightly
to be displayed.

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:25.937
We burned it where it lay.

01:26:26.105 --> 01:26:29.023
We held funeral rites
at a temple.

01:26:29.190 --> 01:26:30.567
Ogura...

01:26:31.276 --> 01:26:33.944
Where are his armour and helmet?

01:26:34.112 --> 01:26:35.780
You're mocking me.

01:26:36.573 --> 01:26:39.159
I'm wearing them.

01:26:39.326 --> 01:26:41.578
Surely you recognise them.

01:26:44.581 --> 01:26:46.666
Of course.

01:26:48.627 --> 01:26:50.337
But I didn't dream

01:26:51.087 --> 01:26:55.884
you would wear them
so soon after his death.

01:26:57.552 --> 01:26:59.473
So I chose not to see them.

01:27:00.139 --> 01:27:02.683
You surprise me.

01:27:03.810 --> 01:27:06.979
I had thought

01:27:07.146 --> 01:27:11.567
my brother would be pleased
to see me in his armour.

01:27:13.069 --> 01:27:14.946
It was stupid of me.

01:27:15.989 --> 01:27:17.365
Forgive me.

01:27:21.619 --> 01:27:23.872
Help me take it off!

01:27:28.126 --> 01:27:29.419
Sister-in-law,

01:27:29.585 --> 01:27:31.797
lam about to be naked.

01:28:07.624 --> 01:28:11.212
Lords lkoma and Ogura,
you have worked well

01:28:11.378 --> 01:28:13.131
to further our interests.

01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:16.468
We appreciate it.

01:28:16.676 --> 01:28:20.012
These gifts are a token of thanks.

01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:31.233
They're also a parting gift.

01:28:31.399 --> 01:28:32.399
Farewell.

01:28:34.987 --> 01:28:37.279
Lord Jiro feels it unwise

01:28:37.446 --> 01:28:41.033
to keep you in his service.

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:44.411
Men who betray one master
may betray another.

01:28:45.372 --> 01:28:47.624
A reasonable point of view.

01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:50.627
Naturally you are disappointed,

01:28:50.794 --> 01:28:52.505
but bear no grudges.

01:28:53.089 --> 01:28:55.382
Is that clear?

01:28:55.548 --> 01:28:57.051
Good!

01:29:08.605 --> 01:29:10.523
The Lady Kaede is here.

01:29:15.277 --> 01:29:16.277
Send her in.

01:30:20.803 --> 01:30:24.891
My apologies for my harsh words.

01:30:25.684 --> 01:30:27.769
I am ashamed.

01:30:28.687 --> 01:30:31.105
The incident is forgotten.

01:30:36.528 --> 01:30:40.781
They say your father has gone mad.

01:30:46.037 --> 01:30:47.872
That should please you.

01:30:49.289 --> 01:30:51.668
What do you mean by that?

01:30:52.710 --> 01:30:54.086
I spoke frankly,

01:30:54.253 --> 01:30:57.424
without gilding my thoughts.

01:30:57.633 --> 01:30:59.885
Forgive me if I offended.

01:31:00.302 --> 01:31:02.053
You must hate my father

01:31:02.221 --> 01:31:06.852
for what he did to your family.

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:08.645
Am I wrong?

01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:14.985
Now it's my turn to be frank.

01:31:16.068 --> 01:31:18.487
You are just as pleased as I am.

01:31:20.364 --> 01:31:21.991
<i>Lord mo, you are now head</i>

01:31:22.159 --> 01:31:24.619
of the house of lchimonji.

01:31:37.338 --> 01:31:40.385
This helmet is rightfully yours.

01:31:55.150 --> 01:31:57.736
I am not blind!

01:31:58.529 --> 01:32:00.782
You murdered your brother,

01:32:00.949 --> 01:32:02.242
and stole his title!

01:32:02.409 --> 01:32:04.035
Prepare to die!

01:32:04.202 --> 01:32:05.203
No...

01:32:05.369 --> 01:32:06.369
Even now,

01:32:06.412 --> 01:32:07.913
you deny it?

01:32:10.498 --> 01:32:12.794
It wasn't I who killed my brother.

01:32:12.961 --> 01:32:14.295
Then who did?

01:32:15.965 --> 01:32:17.340
Speak!

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:19.051
Who was it?

01:32:25.307 --> 01:32:27.433
It was...

01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:31.937
Kurogane.

01:32:32.105 --> 01:32:33.689
Hypocrite!

01:32:34.399 --> 01:32:37.987
You gave the order,
but won't take the blame.

01:32:38.862 --> 01:32:40.655
A fine leader!

01:32:52.667 --> 01:32:54.546
You give in so easily.

01:33:16.943 --> 01:33:21.405
Now I will tell you the truth!

01:33:38.007 --> 01:33:42.554
I don't care about Tara's death.

01:33:44.013 --> 01:33:46.265
What concerns me,

01:33:46.848 --> 01:33:48.600
is my own future.

01:33:50.351 --> 01:33:53.105
I won't be a widow
with my hair cropped,

01:33:53.272 --> 01:33:56.275
nor a nun, with my head shaved.

01:33:57.109 --> 01:33:59.487
This castle was my father's.

01:33:59.653 --> 01:34:01.154
I won't leave it!

01:34:10.663 --> 01:34:13.375
Consider my request well.

01:34:13.876 --> 01:34:16.838
For my part, I'll say nothing

01:34:17.004 --> 01:34:20.508
of your abominable crimes.

01:34:22.176 --> 01:34:23.970
I won't reproach you,

01:34:24.137 --> 01:34:26.180
or speak against you.

01:34:26.806 --> 01:34:30.269
If I did, the kingdom would split.

01:34:31.978 --> 01:34:34.064
But always remember...

01:34:37.318 --> 01:34:38.819
I can destroy you!

01:34:45.575 --> 01:34:48.203
Is it a bargain, Lord Jiro?

01:36:32.476 --> 01:36:33.852
My Lord...

01:36:35.645 --> 01:36:37.772
Yes, sister-in-law?

01:36:37.941 --> 01:36:39.566
Sister-in-law?

01:36:39.733 --> 01:36:42.654
After what we've just done?

01:36:44.364 --> 01:36:46.242
By rights,

01:36:47.325 --> 01:36:49.703
I really should be

01:36:50.663 --> 01:36:52.414
your wife.

01:37:01.465 --> 01:37:04.177
I have my wife, Sué.

01:37:05.470 --> 01:37:07.889
I'll be merely your concubine?

01:37:10.307 --> 01:37:12.184
No... no...

01:37:14.853 --> 01:37:16.897
You're mine.

01:37:17.314 --> 01:37:19.775
No one else shall have you.

01:37:56.521 --> 01:37:58.481
Don't cry, Kaede.

01:37:58.941 --> 01:38:01.819
You won't just be a concubine.

01:38:03.486 --> 01:38:06.073
As long as Lady Sué is there...

01:38:07.239 --> 01:38:09.116
I'll attend to her.

01:38:09.909 --> 01:38:11.494
But how?

01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:15.248
I'll repudiate her.

01:38:16.167 --> 01:38:18.126
That's not what I want!

01:38:18.877 --> 01:38:20.547
After our ecstasy,

01:38:20.714 --> 01:38:22.965
I can't bear it
that another woman

01:38:23.131 --> 01:38:25.384
has known your touch.

01:38:27.302 --> 01:38:29.555
Such a woman cannot remain alive.

01:38:39.273 --> 01:38:42.525
Well now, look where we are.

01:38:44.778 --> 01:38:46.739
If fortune had run true,

01:38:46.905 --> 01:38:49.158
Tsurumaru would live here.

01:38:50.368 --> 01:38:53.037
You shelter in the very ruins

01:38:53.204 --> 01:38:55.289
of the castle you burned.

01:39:01.046 --> 01:39:03.884
Ignorance is bliss, indeed.

01:39:46.676 --> 01:39:48.011
Your helmet, my lord.

01:40:14.163 --> 01:40:16.122
Your plumes.

01:40:17.582 --> 01:40:19.918
Don't you look regal!

01:40:52.369 --> 01:40:54.121
Help, here come demons!

01:40:54.912 --> 01:40:56.290
Two of them!

01:41:09.887 --> 01:41:12.306
Traitors! You must pay!

01:41:13.932 --> 01:41:15.434
No, wait!

01:41:15.852 --> 01:41:16.935
Let us explain!

01:41:17.102 --> 01:41:18.686
Save your breath.

01:41:18.854 --> 01:41:22.150
I know all about your treachery.

01:42:07.571 --> 01:42:09.531
Die, traitor!

01:42:11.492 --> 01:42:12.910
Jiro killed Taro!

01:42:13.993 --> 01:42:15.787
Madness saved Hidetora.

01:42:16.955 --> 01:42:19.082
If he recovers his wits,

01:42:19.291 --> 01:42:20.583
he'll be killed, too.

01:42:40.312 --> 01:42:42.689
Jiro slew Taro, our lord is next.

01:42:42.856 --> 01:42:45.361
We must take him to master Saburo.

01:42:45.901 --> 01:42:47.862
If only we could.

01:42:48.862 --> 01:42:51.740
Mention Saburo and he runs away.

01:42:52.908 --> 01:42:56.329
He doesn't dare face him.

01:42:56.746 --> 01:42:58.539
On that point, he's sane.

01:43:02.668 --> 01:43:04.880
What about Master Saburo?

01:43:08.759 --> 01:43:10.969
Would you like to see him?

01:43:18.768 --> 01:43:22.147
The only way
is to bring Saburo here.

01:43:22.314 --> 01:43:24.482
Maybe he can talk sense to him.

01:43:24.941 --> 01:43:27.862
I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:43:29.363 --> 01:43:31.448
Take good care of him.

01:44:05.150 --> 01:44:08.610
Lady Kaede leads you by the nose.

01:44:12.198 --> 01:44:15.034
If you wish to marry, fine.

01:44:15.618 --> 01:44:19.164
But kill Lady Sué for that?

01:44:20.708 --> 01:44:23.417
Sometimes, killing is necessary.

01:44:24.085 --> 01:44:26.921
But to kill on a whim!

01:44:28.339 --> 01:44:30.507
The order is unreasonable,

01:44:30.674 --> 01:44:32.093
I must refuse.

01:44:57.162 --> 01:44:58.913
Lord Kurogane...

01:44:59.747 --> 01:45:01.206
At the Second Castle,

01:45:01.373 --> 01:45:03.542
there is a supply of salt?

01:45:06.003 --> 01:45:07.880
Of course. Why?

01:45:09.548 --> 01:45:11.925
When you bring back her head,

01:45:12.092 --> 01:45:13.761
salt it first.

01:45:14.095 --> 01:45:18.808
Otherwise, in this heat,
we'll be unable to look at it.

01:45:20.728 --> 01:45:23.355
Lady Sué is so beautiful,

01:45:23.522 --> 01:45:26.316
it would be ungracious to her.

01:45:26.691 --> 01:45:28.567
Since you will go personally,

01:45:28.734 --> 01:45:31.195
there will be no mistake.

01:45:32.614 --> 01:45:34.574
Do it as you see it.

01:46:00.601 --> 01:46:03.729
Why stay with this mad old man?

01:46:05.397 --> 01:46:08.276
If the rock you sit on
starts to roll,

01:46:08.693 --> 01:46:10.737
jump clear.

01:46:17.369 --> 01:46:21.789
Or you'll go with it
and be squashed.

01:46:35.303 --> 01:46:37.722
Only a fool stays aboard.

01:46:42.186 --> 01:46:43.853
What is this place?

01:46:59.453 --> 01:47:01.455
Paradise!

01:47:23.101 --> 01:47:24.979
Think of it.

01:47:26.564 --> 01:47:28.608
All my life,

01:47:30.442 --> 01:47:32.694
I've been his nurse.

01:47:51.882 --> 01:47:53.425
Good boy...

01:47:58.221 --> 01:47:59.765
Sweet dreams.

01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:49.901
I, Kurogane, am back.

01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:13.966
Approach!

01:49:45.122 --> 01:49:47.583
Thank you for being quick.

01:49:48.293 --> 01:49:50.378
At your service, my lady.

01:49:52.755 --> 01:49:56.216
I have brought the object

01:49:56.383 --> 01:49:59.178
as per your instructions.

01:50:03.559 --> 01:50:06.478
Be so kind as to examine it.

01:50:18.449 --> 01:50:21.035
I'll be the first to look.

01:50:49.063 --> 01:50:50.482
What is this?

01:50:51.524 --> 01:50:54.195
Your joking goes too far!

01:50:54.363 --> 01:50:55.822
Is anything wrong?

01:50:59.575 --> 01:51:01.369
Imagine that!

01:51:02.995 --> 01:51:05.497
Lady Sué was a fox in disguise.

01:51:05.705 --> 01:51:07.708
Enough of your tricks!

01:51:07.958 --> 01:51:10.084
This is a statue of a shrine.

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:17.968
Clever fox: first become a human,

01:51:18.844 --> 01:51:21.179
then turns himself to stone.

01:51:23.890 --> 01:51:27.602
Are you making a fool of me?

01:51:28.435 --> 01:51:29.980
Certainly not.

01:51:30.147 --> 01:51:32.733
There are many foxes hereabouts.

01:51:32.901 --> 01:51:36.236
It is said they take human form.

01:51:39.825 --> 01:51:42.077
Take care, my lord.

01:51:42.494 --> 01:51:46.040
They often impersonate women.

01:51:46.498 --> 01:51:50.836
In Central Asia,
a fox seduced King Pan Tsu,

01:51:51.003 --> 01:51:53.548
and made him kill 1000 men.

01:51:53.714 --> 01:51:58.469
In China, he married King Yu
and ravaged the land.

01:51:58.719 --> 01:52:00.804
In Japan, as Princess Tamamo,

01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:03.599
he caused great havoc at court.

01:52:03.765 --> 01:52:08.312
He became a white fox
with nine tails.

01:52:09.438 --> 01:52:13.317
Then they lost trace of him.

01:52:13.943 --> 01:52:16.194
Some people say

01:52:16.402 --> 01:52:19.280
he settled down here.

01:52:20.407 --> 01:52:22.867
So beware, my lord, beware.

01:52:39.345 --> 01:52:42.932
This is how you keep our bargain.

01:52:43.099 --> 01:52:45.267
You conspire with Kurogane

01:52:45.434 --> 01:52:47.186
to humiliate me!

01:52:47.394 --> 01:52:49.188
No, you're wrong.

01:52:49.356 --> 01:52:50.565
Intolerable!

01:52:51.191 --> 01:52:53.317
It's Kur0gane's doing.

01:52:58.990 --> 01:53:00.824
Always Kurogane!

01:53:01.659 --> 01:53:03.869
Is he your only vassal?

01:53:05.204 --> 01:53:07.624
He's the villain who kills Taro.

01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:10.627
He's the hero who saves Sué.

01:53:10.793 --> 01:53:12.962
A two-headed monster!

01:53:13.129 --> 01:53:15.215
This is your "right arm"?

01:53:17.591 --> 01:53:19.761
Until I have Sué's head,

01:53:19.928 --> 01:53:22.013
you shall not see me again!

01:53:38.363 --> 01:53:40.614
Sister... my flute!

01:53:40.781 --> 01:53:42.241
We've no time to get it!

01:53:42.409 --> 01:53:44.118
I've had it since boyhood.

01:53:44.286 --> 01:53:46.163
What shall we do?

01:53:46.329 --> 01:53:49.082
Kurogane said
they'll pursue you.

01:53:49.249 --> 01:53:51.543
I'll go back for the flute.

01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:52.960
Your legs are old.

01:53:53.127 --> 01:53:55.046
I'm the one to go.

01:53:55.212 --> 01:53:58.049
We're near the ruins
of your castle.

01:53:58.215 --> 01:54:01.679
Go there and pray for your dead.

01:54:01.845 --> 01:54:05.016
You may never be back again.

01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:14.066
Tsurumaru, let's hurry.

01:54:20.239 --> 01:54:22.783
I see our castle.

01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:25.411
That is, what's left of it.

01:54:25.578 --> 01:54:27.120
Which way, sister?

01:54:27.287 --> 01:54:28.830
Over there.

01:54:34.462 --> 01:54:35.839
Where?

01:55:23.971 --> 01:55:26.391
Earth and sky are topsy-turvy.

01:55:26.558 --> 01:55:29.226
I was the fool and made him laugh.

01:55:29.769 --> 01:55:32.730
Now the coin is flipped.

01:55:36.484 --> 01:55:38.737
Don't be mute, say something.

01:55:39.445 --> 01:55:42.991
You speak nonsense,
I'll speak truth.

01:55:44.409 --> 01:55:46.828
We'll see what comes of it.

01:55:50.791 --> 01:55:53.000
Begin, old man!

01:56:04.971 --> 01:56:07.848
A serpent's egg is white and pure.

01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:10.393
A bird's is speckled and soiled.

01:56:11.351 --> 01:56:13.646
This is a castle...

01:56:15.732 --> 01:56:17.108
Here's a wall.

01:56:17.317 --> 01:56:20.488
The bird left the speckled egg
for the white.

01:56:21.655 --> 01:56:22.699
Strange...

01:56:22.907 --> 01:56:25.034
The egg cracks, out comes a snake.

01:56:25.241 --> 01:56:28.537
Empty space above the wall.

01:56:29.663 --> 01:56:30.663
Why?

01:56:30.747 --> 01:56:33.042
The bird is gobbled by the snake.

01:56:39.967 --> 01:56:41.802
Where am I?

01:56:44.887 --> 01:56:46.681
Who am I?

01:56:47.139 --> 01:56:48.933
Stupid bird!

01:56:52.687 --> 01:56:54.314
Saburo...

01:57:02.031 --> 01:57:04.241
It hurts.

01:57:07.035 --> 01:57:10.206
I'm a worm, don't crush me!

01:57:11.749 --> 01:57:15.671
Who'd bother to crush a worm?

01:57:20.217 --> 01:57:22.843
Who are you?

01:57:47.242 --> 01:57:49.203
Is someone crying?

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.960
Who's crying?

01:57:58.380 --> 01:57:59.756
Hell!

01:58:00.007 --> 01:58:01.966
Man is born crying.

01:58:02.133 --> 01:58:04.636
When he's cried enough, he dies.

01:59:37.524 --> 01:59:40.192
Saburo has crossed the river.

01:59:40.359 --> 01:59:42.069
He's now in Hachiman Field.

01:59:42.236 --> 01:59:43.279
It makes no sense.

01:59:43.446 --> 01:59:46.492
What can he do with such few men?

01:59:50.369 --> 01:59:52.247
Message from Lord Saburo.

01:59:54.581 --> 01:59:56.751
He is here to find his father.

01:59:58.085 --> 02:00:01.005
That clone, he will leave in peace.

02:00:05.427 --> 02:00:07.512
Fujimaki is at the border.

02:00:21.234 --> 02:00:22.945
I don't like it.

02:00:23.111 --> 02:00:25.447
I didn't want reinforcements.

02:00:26.156 --> 02:00:27.991
You should be glad.

02:00:28.157 --> 02:00:29.702
Thanks to Fujimaki,

02:00:29.868 --> 02:00:32.663
the enemy is pinned down here.

02:00:32.830 --> 02:00:36.917
We can rescue your father
from Azusa Plain.

02:00:37.918 --> 02:00:41.339
But it looks so aggressive.

02:00:41.756 --> 02:00:44.884
One false move could mean war.

02:00:53.351 --> 02:00:55.893
Maybe I was too hasty.

02:00:56.644 --> 02:00:59.440
My worry spurred me on,

02:00:59.607 --> 02:01:02.318
but my son-in-law will grumble.

02:01:02.944 --> 02:01:06.656
Sitting here, we pose no threat.

02:01:20.170 --> 02:01:22.506
Prepare for battle!

02:01:25.759 --> 02:01:28.470
My Lord, this is ill-advised.

02:01:28.637 --> 02:01:31.348
Let Saburo have his father.

02:01:31.515 --> 02:01:33.267
Avoid this war.

02:01:33.725 --> 02:01:35.810
Once he has Father,

02:01:36.103 --> 02:01:40.858
he'll accuse me
of treason and attack.

02:01:41.984 --> 02:01:44.236
We can't give up Hidetora,

02:01:44.404 --> 02:01:46.696
we don't know where he is.

02:01:46.863 --> 02:01:49.866
There is much unrest in the land.

02:01:50.034 --> 02:01:52.912
Fujimaki and Ayabe bide their time.

02:01:53.078 --> 02:01:56.833
We need to retrench, not attack.

02:02:00.795 --> 02:02:03.465
Lady Kaede awaits Lord Jiro

02:02:04.633 --> 02:02:08.428
to celebrate
his departure for battle.

02:02:11.596 --> 02:02:15.769
A warlord doesn't run to his woman.

02:02:16.186 --> 02:02:17.771
Stay away.

02:02:44.423 --> 02:02:46.509
When the enemy is assembled,

02:02:46.676 --> 02:02:49.053
we can go after his lordship.

02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:52.181
Be patient... Rest the horses!

02:02:53.475 --> 02:02:54.851
Dismount!

02:02:56.853 --> 02:02:58.270
Weakling!

02:03:02.024 --> 02:03:04.987
Kurogane has swayed you again.

02:03:05.361 --> 02:03:06.612
No.

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:08.238
It's no time for war.

02:03:08.404 --> 02:03:11.450
Wars are won by strong leaders.

02:03:11.617 --> 02:03:14.787
Why fear Fujimaki and Ayabe?

02:03:18.415 --> 02:03:20.168
Your mistake

02:03:20.542 --> 02:03:24.672
was to spare Hidetora, mad or not.

02:03:26.716 --> 02:03:29.927
To kill him, I have to find him.

02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:35.850
Saburo knows where he is.

02:03:36.935 --> 02:03:40.396
Otherwise, he wouldn't have come.

02:03:50.116 --> 02:03:51.575
Send him a message.

02:03:51.742 --> 02:03:54.537
Say he can have his father.

02:03:55.496 --> 02:03:58.207
Watch his movements

02:03:58.374 --> 02:04:00.625
and send out your assassins.

02:04:16.476 --> 02:04:18.227
I'm lost.

02:04:18.977 --> 02:04:21.273
Such is the human condition.

02:04:25.152 --> 02:04:26.778
This path,

02:04:28.363 --> 02:04:30.075
I remember...

02:04:30.992 --> 02:04:33.118
We came this way before.

02:04:33.285 --> 02:04:36.288
Men always travel the same road.

02:04:36.914 --> 02:04:39.625
If you're tired of it, jump!

02:05:28.758 --> 02:05:30.300
Up there.

02:05:31.010 --> 02:05:32.553
Who is it?

02:05:34.972 --> 02:05:36.391
Sué!

02:05:44.774 --> 02:05:46.402
Sister, that voice...

02:05:48.111 --> 02:05:50.614
This ruin was once a castle.

02:05:51.782 --> 02:05:54.324
It belonged to Sué's father.

02:05:54.909 --> 02:05:56.787
I destroyed it.

02:05:59.665 --> 02:06:01.625
Why am I here?

02:06:04.295 --> 02:06:06.505
Why is Sué here?

02:06:08.299 --> 02:06:09.967
And Tsurumaru too!

02:06:15.431 --> 02:06:17.390
Is this a dream?

02:06:17.557 --> 02:06:19.936
No, this is Hell.

02:06:20.602 --> 02:06:23.649
The lowest level of Hell.

02:08:25.356 --> 02:08:26.356
Mount!

02:10:20.849 --> 02:10:23.268
<i>Message from Lord mo'.!</i>

02:10:46.126 --> 02:10:47.126
Very good.

02:10:58.263 --> 02:10:59.931
He says he won't attack.

02:11:00.099 --> 02:11:03.852
We're to leave once we have Father.

02:11:04.686 --> 02:11:07.315
Let's go at once.

02:11:08.398 --> 02:11:11.776
We'd give away his whereabouts.

02:11:11.986 --> 02:11:13.237
Wait till dark.

02:11:14.613 --> 02:11:16.949
Ayabe is on the move.

02:11:46.437 --> 02:11:49.649
Vulture! He smells blood!

02:12:03.163 --> 02:12:05.165
Stay calm, my lord.

02:12:06.251 --> 02:12:07.710
Ayabe is watching,

02:12:09.379 --> 02:12:10.588
so is Fujimaki.

02:12:17.343 --> 02:12:19.681
They're waiting.

02:12:19.847 --> 02:12:22.935
Don't give them an excuse to attack.

02:12:24.352 --> 02:12:28.565
He wants Father,
but makes no move.

02:12:28.731 --> 02:12:31.025
What's his game?

02:12:50.545 --> 02:12:52.840
She's taking so long.

02:12:56.344 --> 02:12:59.598
I'll go to see what's keeping her.

02:12:59.764 --> 02:13:01.141
No, don't!

02:13:01.933 --> 02:13:04.185
Never mind the flute.

02:13:04.352 --> 02:13:07.021
You're acting like a child.

02:13:07.188 --> 02:13:10.484
I don't want to be alone again.

02:13:11.567 --> 02:13:13.945
You won't be alone.

02:13:21.077 --> 02:13:23.704
This image of the Buddha Amida

02:13:23.871 --> 02:13:26.707
will protect you in my place.

02:13:28.501 --> 02:13:29.961
Sister!

02:13:31.294 --> 02:13:33.798
I won't be gone long.

02:13:35.008 --> 02:13:36.468
Sister!

02:13:57.531 --> 02:14:01.618
I found Kyoami
crying on Azusa Plain.

02:14:02.076 --> 02:14:04.204
Where's our master?

02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:07.457
Forgive me!

02:14:10.835 --> 02:14:12.337
He's disappeared.

02:14:13.923 --> 02:14:15.840
You lost him

02:14:16.049 --> 02:14:17.677
on the plain?

02:14:19.512 --> 02:14:22.097
Now we can't wait for dark.

02:14:29.022 --> 02:14:30.732
I'm going to Azusa Plain.

02:14:30.898 --> 02:14:33.569
Keep the enemy busy here.

02:14:34.778 --> 02:14:37.572
Ten men follow Lord Saburo!

02:14:54.922 --> 02:14:55.922
He's moving...

02:14:56.298 --> 02:14:59.511
He's heading for Azusa Plain.

02:15:01.721 --> 02:15:03.513
Gunnery captain!

02:15:09.812 --> 02:15:12.148
Take your men to Azusa Plain

02:15:12.315 --> 02:15:14.359
and lay an ambush.

02:15:15.403 --> 02:15:18.490
A reward for whoever kills Saburo.

02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:20.616
Are you mad?

02:15:20.824 --> 02:15:23.452
Break your word and it's war!

02:15:24.328 --> 02:15:27.581
So be it. It was inevitable.

02:15:27.831 --> 02:15:30.667
Saburo is not our only enemy.

02:15:30.835 --> 02:15:31.835
So what?

02:15:32.419 --> 02:15:35.630
If they attack, we retaliate.

02:15:36.422 --> 02:15:39.217
We grab their land,

02:15:39.384 --> 02:15:40.718
and enlarge our own.

02:15:41.052 --> 02:15:44.515
Fine words,
but words don't win wars.

02:15:44.722 --> 02:15:47.518
Where's the dog eager for prey?

02:15:48.017 --> 02:15:49.352
Kaede's right.

02:15:49.519 --> 02:15:52.273
You're a mouse posing for a mastiff.

02:15:54.065 --> 02:15:56.277
Kaede barks and you grovel.

02:15:56.735 --> 02:15:58.445
Silence!

02:15:58.778 --> 02:15:59.946
Stay behind!

02:16:00.531 --> 02:16:03.450
If you fear to fight, desert!

02:16:07.664 --> 02:16:08.998
If I desert,

02:16:09.206 --> 02:16:10.917
where could I go?

02:16:12.834 --> 02:16:13.878
Captain!

02:16:14.044 --> 02:16:16.214
You have your orders... Go!

02:16:31.271 --> 02:16:33.147
Message for Lord Saburo.

02:16:33.356 --> 02:16:37.109
"Enemy gunners coming: take care."

02:16:43.907 --> 02:16:45.410
Infantry...

02:16:46.326 --> 02:16:47.955
Forward!

02:17:02.761 --> 02:17:04.472
Thinks he's smart.

02:17:14.983 --> 02:17:16.651
Get ready, men!

02:17:17.317 --> 02:17:21.614
We're moving into the woods!

02:17:54.481 --> 02:17:55.732
Father!

02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:46.118
What a sky!

02:18:49.537 --> 02:18:51.623
Am I in the other world?

02:18:56.044 --> 02:18:57.963
Is this paradise?

02:19:00.757 --> 02:19:01.757
Father!

02:19:01.799 --> 02:19:05.178
Why are you so cruel?

02:19:05.346 --> 02:19:08.473
Why pull me from my grave?

02:19:17.398 --> 02:19:19.693
Don't you know me?

02:19:21.195 --> 02:19:22.612
Father!

02:19:26.907 --> 02:19:28.494
Father?

02:19:31.998 --> 02:19:34.834
What do you mean by "father"?

02:19:38.046 --> 02:19:40.715
Wait, I remember.

02:19:43.968 --> 02:19:46.719
I had three sons.

02:19:54.729 --> 02:19:56.981
Are you one of them?

02:19:57.149 --> 02:19:59.693
Yes, I am Saburo.

02:20:02.405 --> 02:20:03.781
Saburo?

02:20:14.876 --> 02:20:16.253
It's you!

02:20:24.885 --> 02:20:28.764
I have no face to show you,

02:20:29.389 --> 02:20:31.475
no words to excuse myself.

02:20:32.310 --> 02:20:36.189
Give me poison to drink,

02:20:36.773 --> 02:20:38.857
I'll swallow it gladly.

02:20:40.109 --> 02:20:42.069
Don't talk like that.

02:20:42.236 --> 02:20:44.863
I don't hate you, Father.

02:20:45.031 --> 02:20:48.076
No sweet lies, I've had my fill.

02:20:56.876 --> 02:20:59.714
Does he look like a hypocrite?

02:21:01.131 --> 02:21:04.134
True, soft words often deceive.

02:21:05.009 --> 02:21:07.929
But my lord, look at him!

02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:11.350
Tears like this,

02:21:11.516 --> 02:21:13.810
can only come from the heart.

02:21:19.691 --> 02:21:21.775
Come with me.

02:21:22.652 --> 02:21:25.028
You'll live with us,

02:21:25.196 --> 02:21:27.241
and forget this bad dream.

02:21:30.743 --> 02:21:32.704
If only you can forget

02:21:32.871 --> 02:21:35.332
my cruelty to you.

02:21:36.584 --> 02:21:38.336
Forgive me.

02:21:39.086 --> 02:21:42.381
I am a stupid old fool.

02:22:14.791 --> 02:22:16.875
Attack!

02:23:16.479 --> 02:23:18.395
The enemy is in the woods.

02:23:18.938 --> 02:23:22.317
Our superior strength
is useless there.

02:23:22.776 --> 02:23:25.864
Then, they'll burn them out!

02:23:50.596 --> 02:23:51.804
Charge!

02:24:09.158 --> 02:24:10.158
Pull back!

02:24:25.465 --> 02:24:27.343
We outnumber them.

02:24:27.677 --> 02:24:28.886
Crush them!

02:25:19.937 --> 02:25:23.483
Ayabe is marching
on the First Castle.

02:25:24.192 --> 02:25:25.693
Impossible.

02:25:25.902 --> 02:25:28.321
He's on the ridge!

02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:38.790
Those troops are a decoy.

02:25:47.091 --> 02:25:49.425
Pull back!

02:26:37.810 --> 02:26:38.810
Forward!

02:27:38.912 --> 02:27:40.456
That's enough!

02:27:53.345 --> 02:27:55.056
Another cheer!

02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:14.951
I have so much to say.

02:28:17.912 --> 02:28:20.831
When we're alone and quiet,

02:28:21.956 --> 02:28:25.210
we will talk, father to son.

02:28:27.798 --> 02:28:30.134
That's all I want.

02:28:31.426 --> 02:28:33.137
Nothing else.

02:29:10.925 --> 02:29:13.094
He is dead.

02:29:17.514 --> 02:29:19.600
I know when one is dead.

02:29:34.241 --> 02:29:35.950
He is dead.

02:29:37.618 --> 02:29:40.705
You and I live!

02:29:41.914 --> 02:29:43.416
But Saburo...

02:29:56.428 --> 02:29:58.389
You can't die.

02:30:00.934 --> 02:30:03.020
I have tales to tell,

02:30:05.063 --> 02:30:07.150
forgiveness to ask.

02:30:09.902 --> 02:30:11.569
Is this justice?

02:30:13.863 --> 02:30:17.576
Are you gone forever?

02:30:20.872 --> 02:30:22.249
Keep away!

02:30:30.631 --> 02:30:32.967
It grows dark...

02:30:35.052 --> 02:30:36.845
Senile old fool.

02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:11.925
Do not call back his spirit.

02:31:13.260 --> 02:31:15.930
He has suffered enough.

02:31:22.687 --> 02:31:23.770
Lord Saburo!

02:31:34.405 --> 02:31:36.074
Victory is ours!

02:31:36.616 --> 02:31:40.662
The enemy is retreating
with Ayabe in pursuit.

02:31:40.829 --> 02:31:42.831
We've won!

02:31:45.541 --> 02:31:47.043
Alas!

02:31:51.090 --> 02:31:53.342
It doesn't seem possible.

02:31:53.801 --> 02:31:56.429
He isn't hereto share this.

02:31:57.054 --> 02:32:00.181
Hidetora is also gone... why?

02:32:02.520 --> 02:32:05.938
Are there no gods... no Buddha?

02:32:07.315 --> 02:32:09.400
If you exist, hear me!

02:32:09.566 --> 02:32:12.153
You are mischievous and cruel!

02:32:13.447 --> 02:32:15.323
Are you so bored up there,

02:32:15.490 --> 02:32:18.576
you must crush us like ants?

02:32:20.913 --> 02:32:23.665
Is it such fun to see men weep?

02:32:23.831 --> 02:32:26.417
Enough! Do not blaspheme!

02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:30.087
It is the gods who weep.

02:32:32.048 --> 02:32:35.593
They see us killing each other

02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:38.890
over and over since time began.

02:32:39.599 --> 02:32:42.225
They can't save us from ourselves.

02:32:48.316 --> 02:32:49.691
Don't cry.

02:32:51.485 --> 02:32:53.904
It's how the world is made.

02:32:54.113 --> 02:32:56.614
Men prefer sorrow overjoy,

02:32:56.781 --> 02:32:59.327
suffering over peace.

02:33:00.453 --> 02:33:03.289
Look at them in the First Castle.

02:33:03.456 --> 02:33:06.793
They revel in pain and bloodshed.

02:33:07.168 --> 02:33:09.337
They celebrate murder.

02:33:24.769 --> 02:33:26.981
We'll stay, you go to the tower.

02:33:52.964 --> 02:33:54.592
<i>Where's Lord mo?</i>

02:33:55.216 --> 02:33:59.264
Whose head is that...
Saburo's or Hidetora's?

02:33:59.639 --> 02:34:02.724
Neither. My lord ordered me to...

02:34:40.095 --> 02:34:43.015
ls Lady Kaede the master here?

02:34:43.266 --> 02:34:46.770
I serve you, but never her!

02:34:55.069 --> 02:34:56.321
Fox-devil!

02:34:56.488 --> 02:35:00.576
Your scheming destroyed
the house of lchimonji!

02:35:00.743 --> 02:35:03.537
Such is the vanity of woman!

02:35:03.705 --> 02:35:05.623
Vanity, you say?

02:35:07.083 --> 02:35:10.752
I wanted to avenge my family!

02:35:11.003 --> 02:35:13.546
I wanted this castle to burn!

02:35:13.713 --> 02:35:16.468
I have done all I set out to do.

02:35:36.112 --> 02:35:38.489
My lord, prepare to die.

02:35:38.656 --> 02:35:41.158
I, Kurogane, will follow you.
