WEBVTT

00:10.812 --> 00:12.013
<i>Who are they?</i>

00:12.014 --> 00:14.182
<i>Maroons. Escaped slaves.</i>

00:14.183 --> 00:16.050
<i>They must have a camp upriver.</i>

00:16.050 --> 00:17.218
<i>She is everything here.</i>

00:17.219 --> 00:19.354
<i>Priestess, governess, warlord.</i>

00:19.355 --> 00:21.189
<i>She's not to be underestimated.</i>

00:21.190 --> 00:22.393
Spain. What did you
have to promise them?

00:22.394 --> 00:24.392
That I would secure the remains
of the Urca De Lima's gold

00:24.393 --> 00:25.860
<i>and return it to Havana.</i>

00:25.861 --> 00:27.528
<i>You set aside some of the gold?</i>

00:27.529 --> 00:28.729
- She did.
- How much?

00:28.730 --> 00:31.198
- Eh.
- You don't think there's any way

00:31.199 --> 00:33.000
we can challenge that
blockade directly, do you?

00:33.001 --> 00:35.436
<i>We're working on something
to even the odds a bit.</i>

00:35.880 --> 00:37.188
Get her inside!

00:38.562 --> 00:40.508
<i>I wonder if the pardons
are the victory</i>

00:40.509 --> 00:43.443
<i>and that the most enlightened
thing that I can do</i>

00:43.444 --> 00:45.678
is let this be the end
of Captain Flint.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.881
The pirates must be eliminated.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.349
<i>Why not consult Father?</i>

00:49.350 --> 00:51.551
Your father aids us
from his position in Nassau.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.587
- Please, come with me.
- Lower your weapons. Now!

00:54.588 --> 00:55.789
No, no! No!

02:32.227 --> 02:35.385
<i>I saw a dead dog
lying in the grass when I was young.</i>

02:41.725 --> 02:44.660
<i>She was an old bitch in life,</i>

02:44.661 --> 02:46.895
<i>but just a pup in death.</i>

02:51.001 --> 02:54.436
<i>I remember seeing
the first flies set on her eyes.</i>

02:59.709 --> 03:03.579
<i>How strange it was
that they looked so alive</i>

03:03.580 --> 03:06.014
<i>and yet did not move.</i>

03:08.251 --> 03:10.252
<i>That was the first moment</i>

03:10.253 --> 03:13.454
<i>that I wondered what
this moment would feel like.</i>

03:15.525 --> 03:19.261
<i>James, you resented me</i>

03:19.262 --> 03:22.496
because we were so close...

03:24.833 --> 03:26.867
and I threw it all away.

03:28.171 --> 03:30.271
<i>If you join me now,</i>

03:30.272 --> 03:34.175
<i>what if I resented you
for the same reason?</i>

03:34.176 --> 03:36.677
<i>What would I be throwing away?</i>

03:38.180 --> 03:41.181
You can't see it yet, can you?

03:43.285 --> 03:46.152
<i>You are not alone.</i>

04:21.988 --> 04:23.188
Who is that?

04:32.500 --> 04:36.134
That is the king.

05:07.733 --> 05:09.499
Wind's in our favor.

05:11.170 --> 05:13.904
Should be arriving in Ocracoke
in three days' time.

05:22.414 --> 05:24.549
My fourth wife, Constance...

05:24.550 --> 05:28.752
a sweet girl, bright,
but she had her notions.

05:28.753 --> 05:33.057
Cricket in the house means good luck,
a moth in the house, bad.

05:33.058 --> 05:36.860
And the bed... Jesus, the bed.

05:36.861 --> 05:40.231
No hats on it, no brooms near it,

05:40.232 --> 05:43.533
nor any clothes in it
that were worn outdoors.

05:43.534 --> 05:46.904
Any violation of this
brought great misfortune.

05:46.905 --> 05:48.872
I mean, for an otherwise sane woman,

05:48.873 --> 05:53.010
she had these pockets of complete
and thorough madness within her.

05:53.011 --> 05:58.448
Although it's been six years
since I've seen her face...

05:58.449 --> 06:01.918
to this day, if I...

06:01.919 --> 06:05.053
if I see a broom by a bed,
I... I have to move it.

06:07.258 --> 06:09.692
What the fuck are you talking about?

06:12.029 --> 06:14.363
A woman has that power, God-given,

06:14.364 --> 06:16.966
to leave her marks on you.

06:16.967 --> 06:18.968
And it's far harder
to dispose of the marks

06:18.969 --> 06:20.536
than the woman who left them.

06:20.537 --> 06:22.872
You think I'm having second thoughts

06:22.873 --> 06:25.141
about leaving Nassau?

06:25.142 --> 06:28.044
That that is the mark
Eleanor Guthrie left on me?

06:28.045 --> 06:29.145
I know it is.

06:29.146 --> 06:31.447
And I know that you're conflicted

06:31.448 --> 06:34.550
about what you have left behind.

06:34.551 --> 06:37.453
But the question is
whether you can cling fast

06:37.454 --> 06:39.555
to the truth we both
hold in our hearts,

06:39.556 --> 06:41.823
the truth that makes us
of the same mind.

06:41.824 --> 06:43.425
And what truth is that?

06:43.426 --> 06:47.896
That a lion keeps no den.

06:47.897 --> 06:51.499
Because the savanna,
all the space within it,

06:51.500 --> 06:55.603
everything that walks
and crawls upon it belongs to him.

06:55.604 --> 06:59.474
When I talked like that, they all
looked at me like I was mad.

06:59.475 --> 07:00.842
They never understood.

07:00.843 --> 07:03.343
There's hardly any of us who do.

07:05.514 --> 07:07.381
<i>Sails!</i>

07:13.989 --> 07:16.757
- Three masts.
- Colors?

07:20.195 --> 07:22.228
Spanish.

07:25.533 --> 07:27.134
Signal the fleet.

07:27.135 --> 07:28.601
Set a course to pursue.

07:36.011 --> 07:38.478
It was never a rule.
No one ever decided it.

07:38.479 --> 07:41.181
It was just something
of an understanding.

07:41.182 --> 07:43.517
Spanish ships are to be avoided.

07:43.518 --> 07:46.186
Yeah, for fear of reprisals
against Nassau.

07:46.187 --> 07:48.821
I suppose that's one less thing
to worry about now, then.

08:25.191 --> 08:26.858
Give us the room.

08:52.217 --> 08:55.387
They say you are dead.

08:55.388 --> 08:58.622
They say you were defeated
by Captain Hornigold.

09:00.259 --> 09:04.210
They only truly ever have
half the story, don't they?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.528
Yeah.

09:18.042 --> 09:22.880
It's fallen. Hasn't it?

09:24.358 --> 09:26.049
A pardon was offered,

09:26.050 --> 09:29.552
and it brought down our defenses
without a shot bein' fired.

09:33.124 --> 09:37.059
Did no one put up any resistance?
Not even Vane?

09:38.162 --> 09:41.664
Obviously he took no pardon,

09:41.665 --> 09:45.182
but it was all he and Captain Teach
could do to escape.

09:45.183 --> 09:47.837
Teach?

09:47.838 --> 09:50.172
Teach was there on the island?

09:50.173 --> 09:54.009
He was. But he and Captain Vane

09:54.010 --> 09:55.678
slipped away
with most of the men and ships

09:55.679 --> 09:59.080
that might have been willing
to resist the occupation.

10:00.984 --> 10:05.988
I wonder if ever a war
so loudly anticipated

10:05.989 --> 10:09.723
ended so quietly.

10:15.098 --> 10:18.300
How?

10:18.301 --> 10:21.136
How did you do all this?

10:21.137 --> 10:23.171
Before the Rosario raids,
there were warnings,

10:23.172 --> 10:26.107
whispers that Spain
intended to retaliate

10:26.108 --> 10:30.311
against Richard Guthrie
and his growing pirate empire.

10:30.312 --> 10:36.818
I could not leave my wife
and daughter in harm's way,

10:36.819 --> 10:38.886
so I secured them passage here.

10:38.887 --> 10:43.124
It was smaller then, disorganized,

10:43.125 --> 10:46.194
but it was far more remote
than other camps like it,

10:46.195 --> 10:48.997
safer.

10:48.998 --> 10:52.333
They agreed to take my family in,

10:52.334 --> 10:56.036
and I agreed to offer them support
from my position in Nassau.

10:56.037 --> 11:00.841
Of the hundreds of slaves
killed by the Spanish soldiers

11:00.842 --> 11:04.011
during the raid,
no one even questioned me

11:04.012 --> 11:08.215
when I suggested that my wife
and daughter were amongst them.

11:08.216 --> 11:10.350
Not even Eleanor.

11:10.351 --> 11:14.754
When Richard Guthrie left the island,

11:14.755 --> 11:18.658
I was left to oversee his business,

11:18.659 --> 11:20.260
<i>but the scrutiny of wearing the crown</i>

11:20.261 --> 11:23.930
<i>made secrecy difficult
and travel near impossible.</i>

11:23.931 --> 11:27.434
<i>Once Eleanor
was ready to assume control,</i>

11:27.435 --> 11:31.671
<i>I encouraged it
so that I might manage</i>

11:31.672 --> 11:34.340
the survival of both places

11:34.341 --> 11:38.143
outside the scrutiny of either.

11:41.214 --> 11:44.250
For as long as I have known you,

11:44.251 --> 11:46.851
you've been two wholly separate men.

11:52.192 --> 11:54.325
Until now.

11:56.863 --> 12:02.534
Now I can no longer do that
which I am needed to do.

12:02.535 --> 12:06.271
Now my wife, my daughter,
and all who live here

12:06.272 --> 12:08.607
are in the gravest of danger.

12:08.608 --> 12:12.310
They must find a way to steal
what they need to live.

12:12.311 --> 12:17.382
They must learn the skill fast and well
lest it lead them to be discovered here.

12:17.383 --> 12:19.716
And they will need help to do so.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.920
Your help.

12:27.293 --> 12:30.661
A partnership?

12:30.662 --> 12:33.298
He said that?

12:33.299 --> 12:37.401
With Nassau gone,
they've lost a vital supply line.

12:37.402 --> 12:39.670
We would go out
on the account... hunt for them,

12:39.671 --> 12:42.573
using this place as a
hidden base for operations.

12:42.574 --> 12:46.844
However, he acknowledged
that he lacks the ability

12:46.845 --> 12:49.013
to ratify any such arrangement.

12:49.014 --> 12:52.848
He has authority here, but he
doesn't have the final word.

12:55.086 --> 12:56.685
The queen.

12:57.922 --> 13:02.326
Her concerns about
our trustworthiness remain.

13:02.327 --> 13:05.262
He said that he would arrange for
me to appeal directly to the queen,

13:05.263 --> 13:07.497
try and convince her
that we are worthy allies,

13:07.498 --> 13:11.367
and that given the fall of Nassau,
we are partners well matched.

13:11.368 --> 13:13.803
They have a home
with no means to supply it,

13:13.804 --> 13:15.171
we the other way around.

13:15.172 --> 13:19.843
And what if you can't convince her?

13:19.844 --> 13:22.544
I will put the case as best I can.

13:24.114 --> 13:26.248
But if I feel that it isn't happening...

13:31.522 --> 13:34.857
<i>Then I get in close to the queen</i>

13:34.858 --> 13:36.526
<i>and make it clear</i>

13:36.527 --> 13:38.961
that either everyone
on this crew is released

13:38.962 --> 13:41.897
with a guide to take them
safely back to the beach,

13:41.898 --> 13:45.667
or the queen dies
within days of the king.

13:47.236 --> 13:51.339
Even if you could get to her without
being killed in the process,

13:51.340 --> 13:53.241
even if you could
get the knife to her throat

13:53.242 --> 13:56.510
and convince them to let us go,
you would never get out of this alive.

14:19.868 --> 14:22.203
Told you once lived here.

14:22.204 --> 14:24.739
For a short time,
when I was very young.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.407
Before my father
moved us to the interior

14:26.408 --> 14:29.243
and the opium traders
claimed it for themselves.

14:29.244 --> 14:32.279
Home to a smuggler,
den to opium fiends,

14:32.280 --> 14:34.348
salon to a pirate king.

14:34.349 --> 14:37.050
Suppose I'll fit right in.

14:37.051 --> 14:39.353
Before any of that, it was home
to a long line of governors.

14:39.354 --> 14:40.554
It will remember.

14:40.555 --> 14:43.828
Yes, well, let's hope I don't
fit in too well with <i> them.</i>

14:45.193 --> 14:46.559
Sir?

14:46.560 --> 14:49.061
- For your signature.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.867
What is that?

14:53.868 --> 14:55.902
Petitions to the Lloyds,
attesting to the fact

14:55.903 --> 14:57.704
that the damage to
the "Willing Mind" last night

14:57.705 --> 15:01.540
was no fault of ours
and thus insurable.

15:02.543 --> 15:05.111
A month from now,
somewhere in Cornwall,

15:05.112 --> 15:07.213
a clerk will be asked to draft
a letter to Charles Vane,

15:07.214 --> 15:08.781
asking for his version of events.

15:08.782 --> 15:13.432
And they'll withhold payment for years,
awaiting his response.

15:13.433 --> 15:15.221
Between you and I,
if there were ever a moment

15:15.222 --> 15:17.490
in which I sympathized with the
desire to tear down the flag

15:17.491 --> 15:20.126
and declare myself in open
rebellion against the Crown,

15:20.127 --> 15:22.360
it's when dealing
with the insurance company.

15:28.835 --> 15:31.669
He isn't coming back.

15:33.006 --> 15:37.108
Charles Vane is no longer
a part of Nassau's story.

15:37.109 --> 15:39.077
You know that, yes?

15:39.078 --> 15:41.913
<i>My lord.</i>

15:41.914 --> 15:42.981
Do you have it?

15:42.982 --> 15:46.318
Excavation of the northwest
tunnel is complete.

15:46.319 --> 15:49.755
- After significant work to...
- Do you have it?

15:49.756 --> 15:54.259
The main vaults are secured,
as are its contents...

15:54.260 --> 15:56.693
a sizable fortune in Spanish gold.

16:00.599 --> 16:01.666
Thank you, Captain.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.268
The Commodore will
take control of the structure

16:03.269 --> 16:05.670
and ready the gold
for transport to Havana.

16:05.671 --> 16:06.971
Wait.

16:06.972 --> 16:10.374
Any news from the fort as to
Captain Rackham's whereabouts?

16:10.375 --> 16:14.111
I'm told he and Anne Bonny
fled before our arrival.

16:14.112 --> 16:16.979
Their... their
whereabouts are unknown.

16:22.287 --> 16:24.888
Why?

16:24.889 --> 16:29.626
Spain may be appeased, but the
street is still an open question.

16:29.627 --> 16:33.230
If you want me to help you play that game,
I need to know where all the players are.

16:33.231 --> 16:35.632
I see.

16:35.633 --> 16:38.734
And when do you presume
this game begins?

16:40.171 --> 16:41.837
It already has.

16:55.052 --> 16:56.618
Next man.

16:57.921 --> 16:59.688
<i>- Sir.
- Your name.</i>

16:59.689 --> 17:00.756
<i>Fowler...</i>

17:00.757 --> 17:05.493
I am once again
a citizen of the British Empire.

17:05.494 --> 17:08.430
Mm-hmm. Congratulations.

17:08.431 --> 17:12.601
<i>- And your profession?
- Sailmaker, sir.</i>

17:13.536 --> 17:15.203
Thank you.

17:15.204 --> 17:18.874
<i>Next man. Name?</i>

17:20.710 --> 17:22.845
It's done?

17:22.846 --> 17:24.380
I do solemnly swear.

17:24.381 --> 17:27.915
<i>Signed my name, and my account
with the law is now square.</i>

17:27.916 --> 17:30.519
A few hours ago,
any magistrate in the Empire

17:30.520 --> 17:32.854
would have hanged me
without hesitation.

17:32.855 --> 17:34.856
Children would have cheered,

17:34.857 --> 17:37.959
women would have taken comfort...
one less villain in the world.

17:37.960 --> 17:40.095
<i>Men would have looked on in awe,</i>

17:40.096 --> 17:42.197
wondering what adventures and mischief

17:42.198 --> 17:45.700
they'd missed in their lives
that I'd lived in mine.

17:45.701 --> 17:48.803
And with the stroke of
a pen, it's all gone

17:48.804 --> 17:51.205
as if it never existed,

17:51.206 --> 17:54.875
rendering me nothing more
than a humble tavern bookkeeper.

17:59.314 --> 18:03.683
I sincerely hope this doesn't
diminish your attraction to me.

18:06.654 --> 18:10.056
<i>- Move aside.
- Coming through. Step aside.</i>

18:28.008 --> 18:29.208
When weeks went by

18:29.209 --> 18:32.579
with no news of your sentence
having been carried out,

18:32.580 --> 18:34.915
<i>I assumed an arrangement
had been reached</i>

18:34.916 --> 18:37.150
<i>to carry it out privately</i>

18:37.151 --> 18:38.517
<i>or a deal had been brokered</i>

18:38.518 --> 18:41.154
<i>to commute your execution
to a long prison stay.</i>

18:41.155 --> 18:45.825
I suppose I should have seen this,

18:45.826 --> 18:47.660
that somehow your grip on this place

18:47.661 --> 18:50.629
would be too strong
to be denied by a king,

18:50.630 --> 18:55.132
his laws, or even your death.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.171
In the winter, the sun drives
hard through those windows.

18:59.172 --> 19:02.374
You'll be blinded there lest you
keep them shuttered all day long.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.077
I had the desk
where it was for a reason,

19:05.078 --> 19:06.679
though I suppose you haven't
been here long enough

19:06.680 --> 19:08.446
to know how to sit in that chair.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.718
So here you are,

19:13.719 --> 19:16.688
and I do not imagine
you came to decorate.

19:19.817 --> 19:23.628
The governor is going to announce today
the formation of a governing council.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.163
12 seats.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.998
Six filled from his ranks,

19:26.999 --> 19:29.567
six filled from merchants
native to the island.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.503
It will signal
the governor's clear intent

19:31.504 --> 19:33.037
to give the people
of New Providence Island

19:33.038 --> 19:36.808
a meaningful say in their own futures,

19:36.809 --> 19:38.842
and we would like you to bless it.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.580
I am sorry.
Are you offering me a seat?

19:42.581 --> 19:46.850
No. The six names
have already been chosen,

19:46.851 --> 19:48.851
and yours is not among them.

19:57.396 --> 20:01.598
I own title to more of the
street than you ever did.

20:01.599 --> 20:05.836
I earn as much legitimate
income as you ever did.

20:05.837 --> 20:09.039
I have no enemies and strong friends.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.408
I am the one they all come to here

20:11.409 --> 20:14.344
to make peace between them
when no one else can.

20:14.345 --> 20:16.012
You are a pirate.

20:17.348 --> 20:19.014
Excuse me?

20:20.451 --> 20:21.918
The first thing he asked me to do

20:21.919 --> 20:24.954
was to identify pirate
ringleaders on the island.

20:24.955 --> 20:26.289
Organizers.

20:26.290 --> 20:29.859
And you named me?

20:29.860 --> 20:31.794
Undermined my reputation
with him before he...

20:31.795 --> 20:34.430
You abetted the practice.

20:34.431 --> 20:36.866
You signed articles, for Christ's sakes.

20:36.867 --> 20:38.901
You held a share in an active crew.

20:38.902 --> 20:41.270
What I have done so thoroughly
pales in comparison

20:41.271 --> 20:42.805
to what you did before me.

20:42.806 --> 20:45.808
And I lost everything for it.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.644
I lost everything.

20:48.645 --> 20:51.079
Remember that
when you sit in that chair.

20:53.149 --> 20:56.485
You were wise to come to me.

20:56.486 --> 21:01.790
If I remain silent about this council
or, worse yet, oppose its formation,

21:01.791 --> 21:06.828
it will sow all manner of mistrust and
apprehension amongst my colleagues.

21:06.829 --> 21:12.801
For if I can be so easily
discarded, who next?

21:12.802 --> 21:15.103
Which is why you won't remain silent.

21:15.104 --> 21:17.572
Really? Why?

21:17.573 --> 21:19.273
'Cause this is important to him,

21:19.274 --> 21:22.910
that the street understands
that his intentions are genuine

21:22.911 --> 21:25.679
and he means to be a friend.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.948
If you undermine that,

21:27.949 --> 21:30.683
he can make life very difficult for you.

21:31.987 --> 21:34.288
You should know

21:34.289 --> 21:37.690
people do not speak to me
that way anymore.

21:39.527 --> 21:41.328
Be smart.

21:41.329 --> 21:43.429
Was I on that list?

21:46.635 --> 21:49.503
That night before you were taken,

21:49.504 --> 21:53.674
when you made the first of your lists
of those you wanted to see dead...

21:53.675 --> 21:57.844
Mr. Stayton, Mr. Atz,
Mr. Featherstone,

21:57.845 --> 22:01.448
Jack, Anne...

22:01.449 --> 22:04.316
<i>was I on that list?</i>

22:05.319 --> 22:07.586
No.

22:09.056 --> 22:11.858
The night I was taken,

22:11.859 --> 22:14.492
did you inform Hornigold
where he could find me?

22:16.063 --> 22:18.329
No.

24:00.497 --> 24:02.265
Ellers.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.834
<i>Captain?</i>

24:04.835 --> 24:07.535
Get me some rum.

24:15.345 --> 24:18.314
You think that this
is something you can ignore.

24:18.315 --> 24:20.515
It isn't.

24:21.685 --> 24:23.619
I said I would hear him.

24:23.620 --> 24:26.155
How is that ignoring anything?

24:26.156 --> 24:27.790
You said you would hear him.

24:27.791 --> 24:30.325
I need you to listen.

24:30.326 --> 24:33.495
I understand that you think that
Flint is the answer to all of it.

24:33.496 --> 24:35.597
I would like to tell you that I agree

24:35.598 --> 24:39.134
if for no other reason than to
appease you so you can rest.

24:39.135 --> 24:40.935
But in the state that you're in,

24:40.936 --> 24:44.673
the one thing I swear
I will not do is lie to you.

24:44.674 --> 24:45.707
I will hear him.

24:45.708 --> 24:48.643
I will look in his eyes
while he tells me

24:48.644 --> 24:50.679
that he can be trusted
to be a partner to us.

24:50.680 --> 24:55.449
But if I for a moment doubt him...

24:58.887 --> 25:02.290
Do you trust me to make this decision?

25:02.291 --> 25:05.158
Of course I do.

25:11.466 --> 25:13.634
Shall I come back?

25:13.635 --> 25:16.669
Come.

25:20.675 --> 25:22.342
Rest.

25:31.219 --> 25:33.854
Did she listen to you?

25:33.855 --> 25:36.522
No.

25:36.523 --> 25:38.023
You?

25:42.763 --> 25:45.665
I removed one of them
from the cage last night,

25:45.666 --> 25:49.268
<i>spoke briefly with him.</i>

25:49.269 --> 25:50.369
Why?

25:55.175 --> 25:59.277
You're my father, and I love you...

26:01.448 --> 26:03.314
but I do not know you.

26:05.018 --> 26:07.552
<i>Those men, they are your life.</i>

26:07.553 --> 26:12.623
I wanted to know it, at least a little.

26:23.770 --> 26:26.236
I will be all right.

26:56.401 --> 26:58.401
You're against it.

27:01.940 --> 27:06.410
An escape plan that involves
the certainty of losing our captain

27:06.411 --> 27:09.413
in lieu of potentially
getting a powerful ally.

27:09.414 --> 27:11.781
"Potentially" being the operative word.

27:11.782 --> 27:14.184
And if he tries and comes up short,

27:14.185 --> 27:17.154
we may lose our only shot
of gettin' out of here alive.

27:17.155 --> 27:20.623
This would seem to be no choice at all.

27:20.624 --> 27:24.995
Maybe, though you seem awfully
eager to get rid of him.

27:24.996 --> 27:26.528
'Course I am.

27:29.166 --> 27:31.634
We propped him up because
his strength as a captain

27:31.635 --> 27:35.004
was the thing that was gonna
keep us alive.

27:35.005 --> 27:39.676
But now his death becomes that thing.

27:39.677 --> 27:41.845
I understand that you've made gains

27:41.846 --> 27:44.347
towards a rapport
with the captain in recent days,

27:44.348 --> 27:47.549
but if he wants to sacrifice
himself so that we might go free,

27:47.550 --> 27:50.819
I mean, that might
be the first selfless thing

27:50.820 --> 27:53.288
he's done for our benefit
since we've known him.

27:56.059 --> 27:58.826
I'd ask you not to get in his way.

30:58.368 --> 30:59.600
Open.

31:34.436 --> 31:35.468
<i>Charles.</i>

31:48.183 --> 31:49.183
My lord.

31:52.287 --> 31:53.921
I think you know who I am.

31:53.922 --> 31:56.555
May we have a word in private, please?

32:17.811 --> 32:19.312
<i>With everything I have sacrificed</i>

32:19.313 --> 32:22.215
to be a part of Nassau's future,
please understand,

32:22.216 --> 32:24.484
I cannot endorse
a version of that future

32:24.485 --> 32:27.152
in which I am still on the
outside of it looking in.

32:37.397 --> 32:39.966
You want a seat on the council.

32:39.967 --> 32:42.101
You say you want
to be a friend of Nassau.

32:42.102 --> 32:45.738
Well, I am Nassau.

32:45.739 --> 32:49.308
<i>You question whether
I deserve this friendship.</i>

32:49.309 --> 32:50.909
<i>It is a fair thing to ask.</i>

32:50.910 --> 32:54.913
So I suggest, like the longest
lasting of friendships,

32:54.914 --> 32:57.849
the one that lasts to the grave,

32:57.850 --> 33:03.086
I substantiate my worthiness
to enter into it with a dowry.

33:07.160 --> 33:09.861
For obvious reasons,
that is only a sample.

33:09.862 --> 33:11.863
<i>There are several
thousand more behind it,</i>

33:11.864 --> 33:16.366
assuming we are able to reach
an agreement here today.

33:18.003 --> 33:20.438
These are profits
from running a tavern?

33:20.439 --> 33:23.040
<i>Jesus.
It's from the Spanish gold.</i>

33:23.041 --> 33:26.143
Money you held out
from the fort... your share.

33:26.144 --> 33:27.679
<i>Not as far as you know.</i>

33:27.680 --> 33:29.614
Not as far as Spain knows.

33:29.615 --> 33:31.015
As far as anyone knows,

33:31.016 --> 33:32.649
the entirety of the Spanish gold

33:32.650 --> 33:35.152
was captured today
in the fort by your men.

33:35.153 --> 33:37.654
And this?

33:37.655 --> 33:39.323
This comes from nowhere.

33:39.324 --> 33:41.892
That is its virtue.

33:41.893 --> 33:44.829
No covenants, no conditions.

33:44.830 --> 33:47.832
No history.

33:47.833 --> 33:51.535
Just an unexpected investment
from a loyal resident.

33:51.536 --> 33:54.237
An investment so
substantial, I might add,

33:54.238 --> 33:56.906
it would dramatically,
if not definitively,

33:56.907 --> 33:59.843
improve your prospects for success.

33:59.844 --> 34:02.746
And what exactly
would you want in exchange

34:02.747 --> 34:06.316
for this investment?

34:06.317 --> 34:08.051
An end to this conversation.

34:08.052 --> 34:10.353
An end to questions about my past

34:10.353 --> 34:12.355
and a new beginning
in which we all agree

34:12.356 --> 34:16.159
there is no history
in this place anymore,

34:16.159 --> 34:21.330
only a future in which
you and I are truly friends.

34:47.790 --> 34:50.324
Billy doesn't give a shit
if you die tomorrow.

34:54.797 --> 34:56.996
But I suppose you knew that already.

35:00.403 --> 35:02.871
You know, the strange thing is, I...

35:02.872 --> 35:05.874
I should be with Billy.

35:05.875 --> 35:09.811
Until most recently, I'm quite
certain I would have been.

35:09.812 --> 35:14.014
Unbothered by the idea of trading your life
for the rest of the crew's.

35:16.651 --> 35:20.754
And yet, for some reason,

35:20.755 --> 35:22.822
right now I am bothered by it.

35:26.795 --> 35:28.261
But I understand it.

35:28.262 --> 35:31.298
<i>I understand the allure</i>

35:31.299 --> 35:33.133
<i>of ensuring that no one
will ever think you</i>

35:33.134 --> 35:35.167
<i>the villain you fear you are.</i>

35:42.009 --> 35:44.677
What a waste, it seems to me,

35:44.678 --> 35:48.481
knowing it doesn't have to be this way,

35:48.482 --> 35:53.153
knowing the man who talked me
into giving a shit about this crew,

35:53.154 --> 35:56.255
why, he could talk those people
out there into anything.

36:00.127 --> 36:02.060
If he wanted to.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.002
Jesus.

37:20.605 --> 37:23.006
<i>Billy.</i>

37:48.866 --> 37:52.869
I have great respect for your husband,

37:52.870 --> 37:56.272
and I know what he wants me to say...

37:56.273 --> 38:00.776
that you have no choice but to use
me and my men to hunt for you,

38:00.777 --> 38:05.146
<i>that I am your only means of survival.</i>

38:07.584 --> 38:10.752
But let's be honest.

38:10.753 --> 38:12.455
If that is all I can offer you,

38:12.456 --> 38:16.959
then my men and I are dead
before the sun rises tomorrow,

38:18.222 --> 38:21.743
<i>because you know there
is always a choice to be made,</i>

38:22.966 --> 38:24.999
<i>and you don't trust me at all.</i>

38:28.337 --> 38:31.439
So...

38:31.440 --> 38:37.145
let us assume that I can
offer you something better.

38:37.146 --> 38:39.780
<i>You have hidden in this place
for a lifetime,</i>

38:39.781 --> 38:43.418
hidden from the harsh realities

38:43.419 --> 38:47.655
that lie beyond this veil
that you have constructed here,

38:47.656 --> 38:52.692
but the moment that
that shot entered his belly,

38:52.693 --> 38:55.762
that veil began to unravel,

38:55.763 --> 38:57.631
and sooner or later,

38:57.632 --> 39:01.134
you are going to have
to confront these realities,

39:01.135 --> 39:04.771
chief among them being
that England takes

39:04.772 --> 39:10.309
whatever, whenever, however it wants.

39:10.310 --> 39:11.877
Lives.

39:11.878 --> 39:14.980
<i>Loves. Labor.</i>

39:14.981 --> 39:17.216
<i>Spirits. Homes.</i>

39:17.217 --> 39:20.886
It has taken them from me.

39:20.887 --> 39:26.659
I imagine that
it has taken it from you.

39:26.660 --> 39:29.294
And when that veil drops altogether,

39:29.295 --> 39:31.997
they <i>will</i> come for more.

39:31.998 --> 39:35.500
You're suggesting
that you could help us

39:35.501 --> 39:37.636
prevent England
from taking these things?

39:37.637 --> 39:43.408
No, I am suggesting
that we help each other

39:43.409 --> 39:47.345
start taking things back,

39:47.346 --> 39:49.481
and it starts with Nassau.

39:52.218 --> 39:54.252
<i>You cannot stay here.</i>

39:54.253 --> 39:57.189
<i>This camp's secrecy is its virtue,</i>

39:57.190 --> 39:58.823
<i>but that secrecy is going.</i>

39:58.824 --> 40:02.727
Nassau is defendable.

40:02.728 --> 40:06.197
Nassau can supply itself.

40:06.198 --> 40:08.499
Is that not exactly the sort of place

40:08.500 --> 40:11.569
that could replace this?

40:11.570 --> 40:13.504
A place that you could settle?

40:13.505 --> 40:16.773
Settle? Governor Woodes Rogers

40:16.774 --> 40:20.211
holds Nassau Town
with a full company of British regulars.

40:20.212 --> 40:22.279
He holds the harbor with a small navy.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.448
He holds the men on the street
with his pardons.

40:24.449 --> 40:28.219
Woodes Rogers has an inoperative fort,

40:28.220 --> 40:31.054
responsibility for an
administrative nightmare

40:31.055 --> 40:33.289
that isn't going away
just because he wants it to,

40:33.290 --> 40:37.027
and an island full of hunters
that may be placated for now,

40:37.028 --> 40:39.529
but could be awoken.

40:39.530 --> 40:42.298
That <i> I</i> could awaken.

40:42.299 --> 40:45.167
How do you propose to do that?

40:46.804 --> 40:51.541
They pledged to follow me
when they thought I was alive.

40:51.542 --> 40:55.878
They turned
when they thought I was gone.

40:55.879 --> 40:58.748
So I will come back from the dead

40:58.749 --> 41:01.883
and lay claim to what I am owed.

41:03.587 --> 41:05.121
Let's say that by some miracle

41:05.122 --> 41:08.323
we could dislodge
the British from Nassau.

41:08.324 --> 41:11.460
I could not possibly hope
to defend it with my numbers.

41:11.461 --> 41:13.062
<i>Your numbers?</i>

41:13.063 --> 41:14.063
<i>For every man in your camp,</i>

41:14.064 --> 41:16.632
<i>there are thousands
somewhere in the West Indies</i>

41:16.633 --> 41:18.134
<i>living under the same yoke,</i>

41:18.135 --> 41:21.470
chained in fields, pressed on ships,

41:21.471 --> 41:24.339
sold into indenture.

41:24.340 --> 41:26.975
When they see a sitting governor

41:26.976 --> 41:29.478
protected by His Majesty's Navy,

41:29.479 --> 41:34.082
deposed by an alliance
of pirates and slaves,

41:34.083 --> 41:37.986
how many consider joining that fight?

41:37.987 --> 41:40.789
<i>How many thousands of men</i>

41:40.790 --> 41:44.659
<i>will flock to Nassau,
join your ranks,</i>

41:44.660 --> 41:46.427
<i>and help you defend it?</i>

41:46.428 --> 41:49.264
What does a colonial power do

41:49.265 --> 41:52.633
when the men whose toil powers it

41:52.634 --> 41:55.770
lay down their shovels,
take up swords,

41:55.771 --> 41:57.937
and say, "No more"?

42:00.342 --> 42:03.377
<i>Bring down Nassau,</i>

42:03.378 --> 42:05.978
maybe you bring it all down.

42:12.787 --> 42:14.688
<i>Spanish intelligence.</i>

42:14.689 --> 42:17.357
They'll carry files
from station to station,

42:17.358 --> 42:20.160
relaying information up
the chain of command.

42:20.161 --> 42:23.297
Looks like this was a heavy load.

42:23.298 --> 42:25.298
What do you think
they could have had in there?

42:27.301 --> 42:30.337
<i>Well, it could be inventories
for silver shipments.</i>

42:30.338 --> 42:31.805
<i>Could be treasure fleet schedules.</i>

42:31.806 --> 42:33.573
Could be private letters
of the goddamn king.

42:33.574 --> 42:35.174
Could be anything.

42:35.175 --> 42:38.510
Captain. Your name's in here.

42:40.648 --> 42:43.148
What?

42:50.924 --> 42:53.658
The reports from the Bahamas.

42:55.729 --> 42:59.665
English operations in the area

42:59.666 --> 43:01.667
and a dossier on the new governor.

43:01.668 --> 43:03.569
Part of an invasion plan

43:03.570 --> 43:04.903
in case they decide to go in.

43:04.904 --> 43:06.505
No, this isn't remotely a plan.

43:06.506 --> 43:10.075
It's just someone's notes.
Fragments.

43:10.076 --> 43:13.011
Is there anything of value in it?

43:13.012 --> 43:16.081
Not unless we have an
interest in invading Nassau,

43:16.082 --> 43:17.582
which I don't think we do.

43:17.583 --> 43:20.585
<i>Do we?</i>

43:20.586 --> 43:22.686
No, we don't.

43:25.691 --> 43:28.226
<i>Governor hasn't
even been here that long.</i>

43:28.227 --> 43:30.495
<i>How do they learn anything
about him so quickly?</i>

43:30.496 --> 43:34.031
Well, same way they do all the
British governors in the Americas.

43:34.032 --> 43:36.332
<i>They have a spy in his office.</i>

44:03.094 --> 44:05.094
What are you thinking?

44:08.966 --> 44:11.234
At the end of every great
achievement that has ever been,

44:11.235 --> 44:15.305
I imagine one looks back
and is reminded

44:15.306 --> 44:17.407
of the one moment
when good fortune reached out

44:17.408 --> 44:19.743
and gave the thing its blessing.

44:20.578 --> 44:23.980
I think this is the equivalent
of five years' worth of tax revenue

44:23.981 --> 44:27.515
without an ounce of the resentment
that traditionally comes with it.

44:29.786 --> 44:32.322
I've felt fortune's
other hand so many times,

44:32.323 --> 44:34.924
the one that takes instead of gives,

44:34.925 --> 44:38.308
<i>had it snatch away victories
that by all rights should have been mine.</i>

44:38.309 --> 44:42.798
<i>That feeling I know too well
and still bear its scars.</i>

44:42.799 --> 44:44.699
But this...

44:47.003 --> 44:48.770
This feels different.

44:55.611 --> 44:57.812
What happened that time?

44:57.813 --> 44:59.646
<i>How did you get that scar?</i>

45:04.220 --> 45:08.222
Combat with a Spanish galleon
off the coast of Mexico.

45:09.492 --> 45:12.827
We had routed her.

45:12.828 --> 45:14.462
By all rights, her colors
should have been struck.

45:14.463 --> 45:18.032
And they were,
just minutes after the event.

45:18.033 --> 45:20.368
But in that moment,

45:20.369 --> 45:25.974
one of her stern chasers fired a
shot at the most implausible angle.

45:25.975 --> 45:28.175
Nothing more than the
desperation of a dying thing,

45:28.176 --> 45:32.578
but that shot hit us right at the helm.

45:35.050 --> 45:39.920
When the smoke cleared,
my brother was dead

45:39.921 --> 45:41.854
and I had this.

45:46.995 --> 45:50.531
Though I suppose it's some strange
irony that if he hadn't died,

45:50.532 --> 45:52.065
it wouldn't have made for
nearly as interesting a book

45:52.066 --> 45:54.299
and I probably wouldn't
be here right now.

46:15.256 --> 46:17.189
I'm sorry. Were you summoned?

46:23.063 --> 46:24.396
Please forgive me.

46:24.397 --> 46:26.231
<i>This is so foreign to me.</i>

46:26.232 --> 46:30.134
<i>I... I don't know how to do it.</i>

46:37.277 --> 46:38.477
About six months ago,

46:38.478 --> 46:42.281
I was approached by a man
who introduced himself as John

46:42.282 --> 46:46.051
and said his employers wished
to monitor your operation to retake Nassau,

46:46.052 --> 46:49.555
<i>said they had a vested interest.</i>

46:49.556 --> 46:52.624
<i>I assumed this had something
to do with your investors,</i>

46:52.625 --> 46:54.992
which seemed perfectly legitimate.

46:57.964 --> 47:01.231
They offered me
a significant amount of money.

47:02.602 --> 47:06.203
I said... yes.

47:08.073 --> 47:12.843
It turns out the man's name
is Juan Antonio Grandal

47:12.844 --> 47:15.179
and his employer
is the intelligence department

47:15.180 --> 47:17.847
of the Casa De Contratación.

47:29.961 --> 47:33.797
Upon our arrival,
I received a query from them.

47:33.798 --> 47:37.367
It said the department spies
had learned of a series of transactions

47:37.368 --> 47:41.771
to exchange a significant portion
of the Urca De Lima's prize gold

47:41.772 --> 47:43.939
for more portable commodities.

47:45.876 --> 47:47.944
An attempt to walk away
with their money

47:47.945 --> 47:51.148
without them knowing of it...

47:51.149 --> 47:52.981
a scheme they find most insulting.

47:57.121 --> 48:01.456
I was then asked if you had yet
learned of this converted cache.

48:04.128 --> 48:06.896
So standing outside the door just now,

48:06.897 --> 48:11.467
I found myself faced
with two choices...

48:11.468 --> 48:14.803
report what I had just heard,

48:14.804 --> 48:16.838
that you are considering
keeping this money

48:16.839 --> 48:20.441
and know that Nassau will likely
burn for it and me with it...

48:24.147 --> 48:26.415
or I could open the door

48:26.416 --> 48:28.684
and warn you of the full scope
of the danger you face

48:28.685 --> 48:32.187
if you do not return the
entirety of the hidden cache

48:32.188 --> 48:34.488
along with the gold from the fort.

48:41.931 --> 48:45.600
I cannot even begin to imagine

48:45.601 --> 48:48.802
what would motivate you
to tell a lie like this.

48:52.007 --> 48:54.441
So let's assume for the moment

48:54.442 --> 48:56.541
that you are telling the truth.

49:01.115 --> 49:04.451
I will see this money secured

49:04.452 --> 49:07.486
and return it with the rest of
the gold in a matter of hours.

49:09.556 --> 49:11.990
You'll relay this to your contact.

49:13.961 --> 49:14.961
No.

49:14.962 --> 49:18.131
No?

49:18.132 --> 49:20.332
Why not?

49:22.536 --> 49:27.240
The department has estimated
the approximate total value of the cache

49:27.241 --> 49:30.382
based on the scope
of the exchanges involved,

49:32.779 --> 49:35.447
and that is only half of it.

49:47.994 --> 49:50.629
I've been thinking about our plan.

49:50.630 --> 49:51.630
Yeah?

49:51.631 --> 49:53.298
A skiff to Port Royal,

49:53.299 --> 49:55.267
connect with your acquaintances there,

49:55.268 --> 49:57.236
purchase ship, hire crew,

49:57.237 --> 49:58.803
make way back to the continent,

49:58.804 --> 50:00.272
at which point the money
will be secure

50:00.273 --> 50:02.974
and we can establish
whatever future we choose...

50:02.975 --> 50:04.942
the plan.

50:04.943 --> 50:06.344
Yeah?

50:06.345 --> 50:08.612
Yeah, there's a problem
with the plan.

50:10.783 --> 50:12.716
- It was <i> your</i> plan.
- I know.

50:16.255 --> 50:18.656
But I'm afraid I might have
overlooked a critical step,

50:18.657 --> 50:20.925
something I'm not prepared to do.

50:20.926 --> 50:22.459
What step?

50:22.460 --> 50:24.695
We'd need to change our names.

50:24.696 --> 50:28.465
Eventually,
the money will protect itself.

50:28.466 --> 50:30.301
It'll hire guards,
it'll make us friends,

50:30.302 --> 50:32.803
it'll shield itself
with investments and partners,

50:32.804 --> 50:35.005
but as long
as it is in its current form,

50:35.006 --> 50:38.309
it is as vulnerable as a newborn babe.

50:38.310 --> 50:41.645
To protect it, given the attention
our names will draw to it,

50:41.646 --> 50:42.979
we'll need recourse to the law.

50:42.980 --> 50:44.315
And at the moment,
the only thing the law wants

50:44.316 --> 50:47.150
with Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny
is their necks in nooses.

50:47.151 --> 50:50.620
To have that protection,
we'll need to assume new identities.

50:50.621 --> 50:53.223
So we change our names for a bit.

50:53.224 --> 50:55.859
- Who gives a shit?
- I do.

50:55.860 --> 50:57.861
A little bit. I do.

50:57.862 --> 50:59.629
With everything I've lost
in recent days,

50:59.630 --> 51:02.165
I can't afford to lose the name, too.

51:02.166 --> 51:05.300
Not when it is so easy to keep.

51:08.872 --> 51:10.807
- No.
- Just listen.

51:10.808 --> 51:12.709
Are you out of your fucking mind?

51:12.710 --> 51:14.210
Charles was the only one
they singled out.

51:14.211 --> 51:15.345
They could have mentioned us.
They didn't.

51:15.346 --> 51:18.147
They had pardons for unrepentant
murderers back there.

51:18.148 --> 51:20.516
If that is the case, then there are
certainly pardons for us, too.

51:20.517 --> 51:23.552
- Jesus Christ, Jack.
- It'll take us half a day, if that.

51:23.553 --> 51:24.854
We walk into the tavern,
we sign our names,

51:24.855 --> 51:28.157
and then not only are we square
with the law, our money is, too.

51:28.158 --> 51:31.593
We did it.
We beat the fucking game.

51:31.594 --> 51:35.764
Walk another half mile,
we get in that boat,

51:35.765 --> 51:39.000
and we win.

51:39.001 --> 51:40.168
And you wanna go back?

51:40.169 --> 51:43.405
Then this... You stay.

51:43.406 --> 51:45.540
Maybe it's better that way.
You can watch the money.

51:45.541 --> 51:47.743
I'll return within a few hours.

51:47.744 --> 51:50.345
We'll be on the water by nightfall.

51:50.346 --> 51:52.847
I'll meet you here. Stay off the road.

51:54.783 --> 51:56.516
No more than a few hours.

51:58.720 --> 52:00.820
Promise.

52:46.734 --> 52:48.734
Mate.

52:56.276 --> 52:58.685
I'm going to admit something to you.

52:59.780 --> 53:02.113
Please don't take this
the wrong way...

53:04.169 --> 53:05.952
but I didn't think
there was a chance in hell

53:05.953 --> 53:07.753
that was actually going to work.

53:08.933 --> 53:10.355
Me neither.

53:13.626 --> 53:16.295
Thank you...

53:16.296 --> 53:18.128
for opening that door.

53:23.503 --> 53:27.805
So what happens now?

53:29.208 --> 53:33.945
Now we marshal whatever
resources we can,

53:33.946 --> 53:38.049
as many ships as we can muster
and allies to sail them,

53:38.050 --> 53:40.685
men resolved to defy the pardon

53:40.686 --> 53:42.911
and ready to join a war.

53:44.890 --> 53:47.598
Now we go find Charles Vane.
