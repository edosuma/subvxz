07:18.981 --> 07:21.024
You know keeping track of your son...

07:21.108 --> 07:23.152
is like trying to hold water.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.778
Let me get him.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.533
Lamine, my baby.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.577
Are you being a good boy?

07:31.660 --> 07:33.579
Aunty Mariatou tells me
you're not listening.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.289
Ah?!

07:35.372 --> 07:37.541
You call your aunty a liar?

07:37.624 --> 07:41.712
I heard you went to Musa's birthday party.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.672
Was it fun?

07:47.968 --> 07:50.679
There wasn't anything else that happened?

07:51.513 --> 07:53.056
Lamine?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.933
Why did you bite Musa?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.729
I don't want to hear about
any more trouble.

07:58.812 --> 08:02.316
When you come here,
you will have so many toys.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.067
Will it be cold?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.068
Very cold.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.904
There will be snow on the ground.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.655
Remember the pictures I sent you?

08:08.739 --> 08:11.200
Looks like white cotton candy.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.202
White cotton candy.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.079
I will have a very warm coat
waiting for you.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.667
Lamine?

08:25.756 --> 08:28.675
I don't know if you can hear me,
but I will see you so soon,

08:29.551 --> 08:32.054
...my love.

46:54.187 --> 46:56.856
Hello, how are you?

47:03.321 --> 47:05.823
Why did you change
your voice mail message, Mari?

47:07.075 --> 47:09.577
Please keep Lamine up for me.

47:09.661 --> 47:12.121
I get off late these days.

1:26:13.836 --> 1:26:15.254
Where is Lamine?

1:26:15.337 --> 1:26:16.630
Aisha, forgive me.

1:26:16.714 --> 1:26:18.382
"Forgive you?" Where is he?

1:26:18.465 --> 1:26:19.383
...wanted to tell you.

1:26:19.466 --> 1:26:20.384
Tell me what?!

1:26:20.467 --> 1:26:21.677
You said you would have our ticket sooner.

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:22.678
Where is he?

1:26:22.761 --> 1:26:24.221
None of this would've happened

1:26:24.305 --> 1:26:25.764
had you bought the tickets earlier.

1:26:25.848 --> 1:26:27.641
We looked away only for a minute...

1:26:27.725 --> 1:26:28.976
Mariatou!

1:26:29.059 --> 1:26:31.812
Where is Lamine?!

1:26:34.690 --> 1:26:37.109
When we went to the beach.

1:26:37.693 --> 1:26:39.737
The waves...

1:26:40.821 --> 1:26:42.907
...were too strong.

1:26:46.285 --> 1:26:48.370
Didn't know how to tell you.

1:26:52.124 --> 1:26:53.751
He drowned.

1:26:57.296 --> 1:27:00.215
We looked everywhere.
