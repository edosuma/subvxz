11:42.444 --> 11:44.160
we're late
for our wardrobe fitting.

11:46.856 --> 11:48.206
This isn't the junior prom.

11:48.433 --> 11:50.375
We're here for one reason
and one reason only.

11:50.602 --> 11:51.710
To work.

11:51.861 --> 11:54.045
Not to meet cute boys.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.611
-Bye.
<i> -Roman Family Christmas</i>

12:01.704 --> 12:04.038
has been Stellings family
viewing since I was little.

12:04.207 --> 12:06.891
My mama called it
"comfort food for the soul."

12:07.043 --> 12:09.043
She can't believe
I'm a guest star.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.544
We're lucky to have you.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.439
Maybe next time
you'll ask me yourself.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.735
All right, so this isn't
about the Christmas special.

12:16.886 --> 12:19.645
You didn't have to have our
publicists arrange another date.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.574
You could have just asked.
I mean, I have seen you naked.

12:22.801 --> 12:24.391
Yeah, and it was fun.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.652
But I'm not
a one-night-stand kind of girl.

12:26.805 --> 12:29.989
That's why my publicist reached
out-- it's a fake date, PR.

12:30.066 --> 12:31.991
I'm not here for fake anything.

12:32.143 --> 12:34.252
All right, why are you here?

12:34.403 --> 12:36.329
For you.

12:36.481 --> 12:38.131
Bye.

12:41.577 --> 12:43.553
Thank you.

12:46.508 --> 12:48.349
All right.

12:52.255 --> 12:53.563
Hi.

12:54.666 --> 12:55.857
You doing okay?

12:57.185 --> 12:59.685
I know Fake Christmas isn't
the same without Mama.

12:59.854 --> 13:02.171
Nothing's the same without Mama.

13:02.265 --> 13:03.973
What's wrong, Daddy?

13:04.025 --> 13:07.452
Well, it's like this.
Your mother...

13:07.679 --> 13:09.454
she was being blackmailed.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.864
What? How do you know that?

13:12.017 --> 13:14.183
Marty.

13:14.202 --> 13:15.868
Said it'd been going on
for the...

13:15.945 --> 13:17.462
better part
of the last ten years.

13:17.689 --> 13:19.689
Well, I don't understand.

13:19.707 --> 13:21.691
Wh-Who? And why?

13:21.709 --> 13:23.860
"Who" is on my to-do list.

13:23.878 --> 13:25.804
But "why"?

13:26.031 --> 13:28.640
I think she was protecting me.

13:30.626 --> 13:31.976
My affair.

13:32.128 --> 13:33.719
You know,
the one I told you about.

13:33.872 --> 13:35.146
That was years ago.

13:35.298 --> 13:36.297
Somebody must've known.

13:36.374 --> 13:37.631
And you know your mother.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.151
The Roman image was
important to her,

13:40.303 --> 13:42.803
at... at any expense.

13:42.897 --> 13:44.489
I don't think that was it.

13:45.808 --> 13:48.809
The night Mama passed,
she said something to me.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.478
I've done things
that can never

13:51.647 --> 13:54.390
be forgiven.

13:54.483 --> 13:56.075
I didn't know...

13:56.227 --> 13:58.837
what it meant.
I-I still don't, but...

13:59.064 --> 14:01.397
it wasn't about you.

14:01.416 --> 14:03.716
I think Mama may have
secrets of her own.

14:16.414 --> 14:19.599
Another lump of coal
for you, Gigi.

14:19.751 --> 14:21.417
That's okay, Nicky.

14:21.436 --> 14:24.011
<i> 'Cause coal turns</i>
<i> into diamonds.</i>

14:24.030 --> 14:26.089

14:26.091 --> 14:28.091
<i> your luck is what you make it.</i>

14:28.093 --> 14:31.035
<i> -And Mama turned her luck...</i>
-Ridiculous.

14:31.262 --> 14:34.980
They're grown women now.

14:35.133 --> 14:37.600

Oh, don't, don't be a grinch.

14:37.619 --> 14:40.027
They're helping people
feel better about their lives.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.529
We're the first family
of country music.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.290
And that's degrading.

14:44.442 --> 14:46.626
Look, all right, I know you
never had any of this

14:46.720 --> 14:48.111
when you were growing up.

14:48.204 --> 14:49.721
You had no Christmas,
no music...

14:49.948 --> 14:52.373
no love.

14:52.450 --> 14:55.376
But even though our girls
are out there pretending,

14:55.470 --> 14:56.728
the audience,

14:56.897 --> 14:59.046
what they're feeling is real.

14:59.065 --> 15:02.125
Real love, real joy.

15:02.143 --> 15:05.219
Just what I feel every morning
when I wake up with you.

15:05.313 --> 15:08.072
Now don't you think
everybody is entitled

15:08.224 --> 15:09.741
to have just
a little bit of that?

15:09.968 --> 15:12.059
What would I be without you?

15:12.153 --> 15:14.078
Oh, you'd be fine.

15:14.230 --> 15:16.897
And you're never gonna have
to find out because

15:16.917 --> 15:19.709
I'm always gonna be with you.

-It's to show everybody

Now this is getting good.

16:03.279 --> 16:05.521
-So what's the problem?
-He's a lot younger than me.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.781
And I don't even know
who I am with a man anymore.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.134

for once?

16:10.286 --> 16:12.303

for Halloween one year.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.703
I had a lasso and everything.

22:52.855 --> 22:54.613
That's cute.

22:54.765 --> 22:56.615
You don't strike me as a cowboy.

22:56.767 --> 22:58.267
You don't strike me as someone

22:58.360 --> 23:00.252
who wants a cowboy
to take her away.

23:01.288 --> 23:03.272
Well, I'd say everybody wants

23:03.365 --> 23:05.966
a cowboy once in their life.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.794
I know your mom built
this empire

23:08.946 --> 23:11.296
on being the ideal family
and all.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.891
But you don't have
to be perfect all the time.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.784
No one is.

23:15.878 --> 23:19.230
My mama always told me
that if...

23:19.457 --> 23:21.715
you act
like everything is perfect,

23:21.734 --> 23:23.626
then...

23:23.719 --> 23:25.051
it will be.

23:25.146 --> 23:27.129
(chuckles) Don't know
if I believe her, but...

23:27.298 --> 23:29.481
Yeah, your mother was
a huge loss.

23:29.634 --> 23:31.242
For all of you
in different ways.

23:31.393 --> 23:34.136
You talking about my daddy?

23:34.229 --> 23:37.063
I've, I've...
tried my best to help him...

23:37.083 --> 23:39.083
Well, no one can be
all things to all people

23:39.234 --> 23:40.159
without any help.

23:40.311 --> 23:42.144
Have you ever heard
of Dottie Roman?

23:42.163 --> 23:43.421
Yeah, well...

23:43.572 --> 23:45.648
maybe quit worrying
about being Dottie.

23:45.666 --> 23:47.983
And just focus on being Nicky
for a change.

23:48.002 --> 23:50.169
Well, that is very easy
for you to say.

23:50.263 --> 23:52.838
Supposedly a woman has to...

23:52.990 --> 23:55.841
be it all, have it all.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.676
Not if she chooses
the right cowboy.

23:57.828 --> 23:59.770
(chuckles)
Well, you already

23:59.997 --> 24:01.847
said that...

24:01.999 --> 24:04.591
that's not me.

24:04.685 --> 24:06.669
I can take care of myself.

24:06.687 --> 24:08.170
I'm sure you can.

24:08.189 --> 24:09.688
The question is...

24:09.782 --> 24:11.323
why would you want to?

24:18.849 --> 24:21.000
(laughter)

24:21.944 --> 24:24.536
I can't believe I'm here.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.131
If my mom knew,
she'd kill us both.

24:27.282 --> 24:29.300
-Well, should I take you back?
-Are you crazy?

24:30.303 --> 24:32.619
Two weeks ago,
I was in Albuquerque

24:32.713 --> 24:34.046

24:34.140 --> 24:36.081

24:39.795 --> 24:41.645
I feel like Cinderella.

24:41.797 --> 24:44.523
Your home is beautiful.

24:46.393 --> 24:48.569

25:14.680 --> 25:17.923
Every time I do this special,
I'm five years old again.

25:18.075 --> 25:20.926
Nicky is the perfect
pretty princess

25:21.078 --> 25:23.837

25:23.931 --> 25:26.098

25:27.935 --> 25:29.585
Hey.

25:29.678 --> 25:31.028
You are my Nutcracker.

25:31.255 --> 25:32.512
Well...

25:32.606 --> 25:34.757
let's hope you still feel that
way after I go out there

25:34.850 --> 25:36.659
and make a big fool of myself.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.094
Then don't.

25:39.113 --> 25:41.113
What do you mean?

25:41.265 --> 25:43.265
Either walk off this set

25:43.284 --> 25:46.526
and tell your family
you're done being their mascot.

25:46.546 --> 25:48.620
Or you quit complaining,
you go out there

25:48.773 --> 25:51.123
and you do things your way.

25:51.275 --> 25:54.385

you just have to be yourself.

-(sighs)

34:15.962 --> 34:18.113
I know people like the Romans.

34:18.131 --> 34:20.373
They use people
and they toss them out.

34:20.392 --> 34:24.061
And I won't let them do that
to you.

Y'all may not know this,

for Fake Christmas

34:46.827 --> 34:49.086
or real Christmas,
for that matter.

34:49.313 --> 34:52.163
Dottie Roman changed all that.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.833
And even though she's not here
in person tonight,

34:54.927 --> 34:58.837
her spirit will be part
of this special forever.

34:58.931 --> 35:02.599
So happy holidays from us,

35:02.826 --> 35:04.342
