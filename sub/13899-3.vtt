09:03.500 --> 09:05.830
surveillance footage about
a Bugden's cab.

09:10.210 --> 09:11.880
Are you thinking about
the parallel?

09:11.920 --> 09:13.130
You mean the multiverse
universes parallel?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.010
No. Of course you don't
mean that.

09:16.050 --> 09:18.050
You were talking about my time
in the group home.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.390
It's okay, honey.

09:20.430 --> 09:21.810
You two share a similar past.

09:21.850 --> 09:24.770
I mean, you both spent a lot of
time in that system.

09:24.810 --> 09:27.100
- You know this girl.
- I am that girl!

09:27.150 --> 09:29.770
I was that girl, a guy.
I'm a man.

09:30.980 --> 09:31.980
Look.

09:33.110 --> 09:34.610
When you grow up in that
environment.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.450
And don't get me wrong--

09:36.490 --> 09:39.410
Because there are lots of
amazing people

09:39.450 --> 09:40.580
who work in those group homes.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.450
And they really try and help.

09:42.490 --> 09:43.870
And thank God that they exist.

09:44.290 --> 09:45.210
But--

09:45.250 --> 09:46.500
But it' not exactly ideal.

09:46.540 --> 09:47.920
No. It's not.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.090
And--

09:51.170 --> 09:54.260
And sometimes
you make decisions.

09:54.300 --> 09:57.130
And choices that you wouldn't
necessarily make

09:57.180 --> 09:59.220
if you had someone
looking out for you.

09:59.760 --> 10:00.930
And Sloane?

10:02.180 --> 10:06.690
She needs,
like a Doyle family.

10:06.730 --> 10:08.900
You and I
can both relate to her.

10:09.980 --> 10:11.650
And I think
that we can help her.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.190
You're a good fella.

10:13.820 --> 10:14.740
[Cooper]
Hello?

10:16.150 --> 10:18.990
Is this Doyle and Doyle
Investigating?

10:19.030 --> 10:21.410
And Courtney. Yes. Yes.
And you are?

10:21.450 --> 10:21.490
Clark Cooper.

10:22.910 --> 10:25.330
Your services were required
by William Bastion?

10:25.370 --> 10:26.750
I'm sorry,
but as you can imagine,

10:26.790 --> 10:28.710
we can't reveal anything about
any of our clients.

10:28.750 --> 10:29.960
[Cooper]
I'm Bastion's boss.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.880
I'm the one footing the bill.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.010
Well, this seems to be
all in order.

10:35.050 --> 10:37.010
And a signature.
That's always good.

10:37.050 --> 10:38.130
[Cooper]
Bastion said he hired you

10:38.170 --> 10:40.340
to track down
my missing belongings.

10:40.380 --> 10:43.010
Until we identify that you're
exactly who you say you are,

10:43.050 --> 10:44.680
we can't discuss
this case with you.

10:46.060 --> 10:47.600
You're fired.
That check

10:47.640 --> 10:51.230
should total the complete amount
of what our contract entails.

10:51.270 --> 10:52.400
Mister Cooper. Is there a reason

10:52.440 --> 10:53.400
why you want to
terminate our contract?

10:54.270 --> 10:55.480
Nothing serious was stolen.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.450
I'm certain you have more
pressing issues to deal with.

10:59.490 --> 11:01.950
Why don't I have Bastion call
you to wrap things up?

11:02.450 --> 11:03.410
Good day.

11:04.910 --> 11:07.870
Did he just take
that photo that Jake took?

11:07.910 --> 11:09.210
Yeah. Yeah. He did.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.870
And there's a whole lot wrong
with that guy.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.590
Listen, I'm gonna call Bastion.
You go follow him.

11:14.170 --> 11:15.050
Oh, I'm on it.

11:16.920 --> 11:19.420
Oh. Ah...
Inspector.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.390
What's going on with the
Jake Doyle explosion?

11:21.430 --> 11:22.300
Cole's notes?

11:23.390 --> 11:24.760
The techies haven't
leaned a lot.

11:24.800 --> 11:27.180
But we now know
the explosive device was prepped

11:27.220 --> 11:28.930
just minutes
before Sloane got there.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.810
So the culprit left the scene
just before we arrived.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.650
Anything else?

11:33.690 --> 11:35.650
One of the components used was
starting fluid.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.070
It's a bit of an odd choice.

11:38.110 --> 11:39.030
You know what I'm going to say?

11:39.070 --> 11:41.910
No. I don't. What?

11:41.950 --> 11:43.370
Before I hired you--

11:44.120 --> 11:45.530
Gave you this promotion,

11:45.580 --> 11:47.990
some people warned me about your
connection to Jake.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.620
And how your personal life might

11:49.660 --> 11:51.330
cross over
into your professional.

11:51.370 --> 11:52.370
You're an excellent cop.

11:53.460 --> 11:54.460
I'm just telling you
to be careful.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.710
But I want you to know
that I trust your judgement.

11:57.750 --> 12:00.090
And I won't be meddling
in your personal life.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.380
Just watch yourself.

12:03.970 --> 12:05.010
Point taken.

12:05.050 --> 12:05.970
Good.

12:08.470 --> 12:09.980
Oh. Ahh...

12:10.020 --> 12:11.390
Topic change. Um...

12:12.560 --> 12:14.850
I hope this isn't
an odd request, but--

12:14.900 --> 12:17.400
I'm hosting a dinner this
weekend for the senior staff,

12:17.440 --> 12:19.730
and some of my up and coming
stars like yourself.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.860
That's really nice
of you to ask.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.950
I always feel a bit
uncomfortable around the Brass.

12:24.990 --> 12:27.370
Like it or not, Bennett, some
day you'll be the Brass.

12:36.500 --> 12:38.170
[Jake]
Where'd you get all that?

12:38.210 --> 12:39.340
Did you find it under
the floorboards there?

12:39.380 --> 12:40.760
How'd you figure that out?

12:40.800 --> 12:42.470
Raising three youngsters
will teach you a thing or two

12:42.510 --> 12:43.550
about hiding places.

12:43.590 --> 12:44.800
I guess you're right.

12:45.180 --> 12:46.340
Hey.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.050
I know some of these things
are shiny, but--

12:48.100 --> 12:49.010
try and stay with me here.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.060
Just leave me alone, will ya?

12:50.100 --> 12:51.350
So what do you think?

12:51.390 --> 12:53.140
Most of this stuff from
the houses she robbed?

12:53.180 --> 12:54.850
None of it looks very valuable.

12:54.890 --> 12:57.190
[Mal] That list that
Bastion emailed us.

12:57.230 --> 12:59.190
Mostly items of sentimental
value on it.

13:00.110 --> 13:01.480
Where did this one come from?

13:01.530 --> 13:02.190
That was hidden with the others.

13:02.900 --> 13:03.900
[Jake]
This girl.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.490
She looks really familiar.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.910
Whatever that guy
was looking for --

13:10.120 --> 13:11.790
How much you wanna be
it's in this pile?

13:11.830 --> 13:13.960
[phone rings]

13:15.000 --> 13:16.250
Yeah.

13:16.290 --> 13:17.670
Okay. I have to whisper.
'Cause I'm on a stakeout.

13:17.710 --> 13:19.040
And it's awesome.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.630
Des, being annoying is a choice.
So what do you want?

13:21.670 --> 13:22.590
Be nice, will ya?

13:22.630 --> 13:23.920
[Des] As per usual,

13:23.970 --> 13:25.180
I've been monitoring your
credit card activity.

13:25.220 --> 13:26.680
I actually have a
an alert on my phone.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.050
Really, now shut up
and hurry up.

13:29.100 --> 13:32.060
There was a charge at a Poutine
Restaurant near Patrick Street.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.560
about five minutes ago.
I think it's Sloane.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.640
So not only did this girl
steal my car,

13:35.690 --> 13:37.520
she's also using my credit card.
I'm gonna--

13:37.560 --> 13:40.360
Don't be too hard on her. Okay?
She needs our support.

13:41.610 --> 13:42.530
I gotta go.

13:42.570 --> 13:43.490
Des--

13:43.530 --> 13:44.490
Des hung up on you?

13:44.530 --> 13:45.570
And he is as loyal

13:45.610 --> 13:47.200
as the day is long.
Or was, anyway.

13:47.240 --> 13:48.610
Take that as a sign son.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.280
First of all, he was on a
stakeout. Second of all --

13:51.870 --> 13:54.080
You're really getting on my
nerves today. So knock it off.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.000
Yes b'y.

13:57.710 --> 13:57.750
[click]

13:59.000 --> 14:00.840
[Philip] You Cooper?
You call for a cab?

14:00.880 --> 14:02.500
You don't remember me.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.050
Ha, ha, ha. How about now?

14:05.090 --> 14:06.920
Look man! Alright.
I'm not afraid of you.

14:06.970 --> 14:09.260
Good boy. Because we're taking
a drive, you and I.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.720
We're gonna meet your partner.
And have a little

14:10.760 --> 14:12.350
chat about what you two did.

14:12.390 --> 14:13.270
Now get in there.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.270
He means Sloane?

14:18.270 --> 14:19.230
[click]

14:19.270 --> 14:20.650
Seriously,
where's your head today?

14:20.690 --> 14:21.690
What's going on?
Tell me.

14:22.770 --> 14:24.900
Oh.
Leslie broke up with you, right?

14:26.070 --> 14:27.700
Well, we both knew
this day would come.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.910
It's not that.
It's something else.

14:30.950 --> 14:32.080
[Jake]
There's my car.

14:32.620 --> 14:33.540
I got this.

14:42.630 --> 14:44.000
[Sloane]
He did well for himself.

14:44.710 --> 14:45.630
[Jake]
Hey!

14:45.670 --> 14:47.550
You little shit.
Remember me?

14:47.590 --> 14:48.550
[locked door sound]

14:50.340 --> 14:51.760
See I knew you'd get out of
those cuffs alright.

14:52.510 --> 14:54.970
Out of my car.
Now.

14:55.010 --> 14:58.730
She's got some serious guts.
Really, really tight.

14:58.770 --> 15:00.020
But I gotta say--

15:00.060 --> 15:01.900
Your brake pads
are shagged though.

15:01.940 --> 15:03.900
[squealing tires]

15:09.070 --> 15:11.620
See if you had kids, you'd
have known that was coming.

15:12.950 --> 15:14.370
Breaks work fine to me.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.830
Okay. You got me.

15:15.870 --> 15:17.080
[Jake]
Unlock the door.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.540
Get out.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.460
Man, you're some stubborn.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.840
Don't slam my door.

15:25.630 --> 15:27.260
Did you steal anything?

15:27.300 --> 15:30.340
No! I will not have sex with you
for twenty bucks!

15:30.380 --> 15:31.430
No no now...
Don't be at that.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.180
- Pervert!
- No! Now that's not what, no.

15:35.220 --> 15:36.640
Just get--Look.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.600
She stole my car.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.390
It's not what it looks like.

15:39.430 --> 15:42.310
Okay? She stole my wallet
and my car.

15:42.350 --> 15:43.690
That's my car. What do you
think? She owns that car?

15:43.730 --> 15:45.320
Get out of my face.
The lot of ye.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.570
See? Just--
Mind your own...

15:49.610 --> 15:52.450
I know you had this. Ha ha.

15:52.490 --> 15:55.200
I can't believe you got you dad
to stop me from bullying you.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.910
[Mal]
She has a point, son.

15:58.700 --> 15:59.910
What did you do to my trunk?

16:00.330 --> 16:01.250
Nothing.

16:01.290 --> 16:02.580
No by, knows you didn't.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.090
Oh my God...

16:16.100 --> 16:17.600
[Leslie]
His name is Clark Cooper.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.480
He's a senior VP of operations
of the Bank of Newfoundland.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.060
He's our client.
Bastion's Boss.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.560
He hired us to recover some of
his belongings that were stolen.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.690
I'm going to check with Rose.

16:25.730 --> 16:27.520
See if she knows
what happened to him.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.230
The items.
Were they stolen by Sloane?

16:29.280 --> 16:30.240
I don't know.
It looks like it.

16:30.280 --> 16:31.190
[Sloane]
I know my rights,

16:31.240 --> 16:32.650
I've read them
many a time...

16:32.700 --> 16:33.700
Police brutality.

16:33.740 --> 16:36.240
This is obviously
a total frame job.

16:37.950 --> 16:39.160
Do I have to, you know,

16:39.200 --> 16:40.790
run out and buy some
little people clothing?

16:40.830 --> 16:42.160
Are we having a baby or what?

16:42.210 --> 16:44.420
It's not a great time to ask.
But I'm pretty sure

16:44.460 --> 16:46.500
I'm not ready to be responsible
for a kid.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.670
Especially
one that turns out like that.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.170
Well they don't start
that way.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.760
I mean, you got to raise
them first.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.180
And besides Sloane is a good
person, okay?

16:54.220 --> 16:56.890
She may be a thief but she's not
a murderer. I know that.

16:56.930 --> 16:58.010
It doesn't look good.

16:58.050 --> 17:00.390
She's a lead suspect
in the arson.

17:00.430 --> 17:02.350
And now one of her robbery
victims was found dead

17:02.390 --> 17:03.480
in the back of your car,

17:03.520 --> 17:04.770
that she was driving.

17:04.810 --> 17:06.860
Yes b'y Leslie.
She stole my car, killed Cooper,

17:06.900 --> 17:08.060
stuck him in the trunk.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.400
And then she stopped
for a bit of Poutine.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.360
Why would she do that?

17:10.400 --> 17:11.740
I don't know, she's a kid.

17:16.610 --> 17:18.740
I haven't taken
the pregnancy test.

17:19.870 --> 17:19.910
Yet.

17:21.410 --> 17:24.410
Is that, like, a comment on
the would be father or...

17:24.460 --> 17:26.290
I just haven't had a chance.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.920
I'll take it when I get back
to the station.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.050
[sound of GTO engine
trying to turn over]

17:32.090 --> 17:33.420
Sorry!

17:33.460 --> 17:35.470
You're going to need to get
this looked at, Doyle.

17:35.510 --> 17:37.760
The clutch is a little arsed up.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.100
Why is he --? Why is he in my
car? Why is he in my car?

17:40.140 --> 17:40.640
I gotta take it in.

17:41.350 --> 17:42.470
It's a crime scene.

17:42.890 --> 17:43.600
Here.

17:44.180 --> 17:45.060
Take the bus.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.350
Just got off the phone
with Rose.

17:47.940 --> 17:48.980
Cooper paid us.

17:49.020 --> 17:50.190
And then fired us
just before he died.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.070
What?

17:52.110 --> 17:54.280
That's got to be some kind of
record, I mean even for us.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.950
Yeah? We're officially
off the case.

17:55.990 --> 17:58.160
No, no Dad. Look.
We gotta stay on the case.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.740
We've got to prove
Sloane's innocence.

17:59.780 --> 18:01.870
If we don't, it's going
to ruin her whole life.

18:01.910 --> 18:03.080
[sound of GTO trying to start]

18:03.870 --> 18:04.960
Almost got it!

18:13.130 --> 18:14.260
Nothing in here
worth killing over.

18:15.510 --> 18:17.760
Yet a man is dead
and a girl's room torn up.

18:17.800 --> 18:18.840
Someone is looking
for something.

18:18.890 --> 18:19.930
[Des]
Yeah, but what?

18:19.970 --> 18:21.430
[Jake]
This woman she looks familiar.

18:21.470 --> 18:22.180
Frame seems a little different
than the rest.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.430
That's Sloane's mom.
I checked with the group home.

18:25.470 --> 18:27.730
Ellen Daniels, but I don't think
that's part of the stolen stuff.

18:27.770 --> 18:28.520
Ellen Daniels?

18:29.850 --> 18:31.560
I went to high school with her.
Do you remember?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.070
I use to hang out with her
all the time.

18:33.110 --> 18:34.190
I can't believe that
her daughter ended up

18:34.230 --> 18:34.280
in this kind of mess.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.610
You heard from Bastion?

18:36.650 --> 18:38.570
I've been trying to call him.
But he hasn't been picking up.

18:38.610 --> 18:40.240
And now is boss is dead.
Bummer.

18:41.070 --> 18:42.530
[Bastion]
Clark's... Dead?

18:42.580 --> 18:43.490
[Rose]
Mr. Bastion.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.200
I'm so sorry.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.370
That, that girl Sloane.
She stole from him.

18:48.410 --> 18:49.540
But I didn't think
she'd kill him.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.080
Sloane didn't kill anyone.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Did Cooper
have any enemies?

18:54.050 --> 18:55.590
No. I know everything
about him.

18:55.630 --> 18:57.970
He, he wasn't the easiest guy to
work for, but he was a banker.

18:58.010 --> 18:59.430
I mean everybody
kind of hated him.

18:59.470 --> 19:00.390
But not like that,
you know?

19:00.430 --> 19:02.300
Not, not enemies.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.180
We know for sure that Cooper was

19:04.220 --> 19:06.680
beating the crap
out of this cab driver.

19:06.720 --> 19:07.600
Don't you think
that could possibly

19:07.640 --> 19:09.060
make an enemy out of someone?

19:09.100 --> 19:10.560
[Rose] I called the group home.
He used to live there

19:10.600 --> 19:11.980
as a minor.
His name is Philip Sinnot.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.190
Does it ring any bells?

19:13.230 --> 19:14.400
No. I, I don't know,
I've never heard of him.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.940
This is so sad.

19:15.980 --> 19:18.190
Cooper's house gets rob when
he's on vacation and now this?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.700
We did manage to recover
his stolen items.

19:19.740 --> 19:21.360
Is there anything in here
worth killing for?

19:21.410 --> 19:24.160
No. I think they're just
sentimental junk.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.660
I'll see it gets
to the proper hands.

19:25.700 --> 19:26.870
Thank you.

19:28.830 --> 19:31.000
Cooper was robbed when he was
out of town, yeah?

19:31.040 --> 19:32.540
Yeah.

19:32.580 --> 19:35.130
So were the owners of all the
other houses, Sloane robbed.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.840
Who else would know?

19:39.880 --> 19:41.340
If you were leaving town?

19:42.590 --> 19:43.970
Whoever takes you
to the airport.

19:44.010 --> 19:44.930
Your Mom!

19:44.970 --> 19:45.140
No Des. Cab Driver.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.560
Let's go see Leslie.
See what Sloane has to say.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.810
Think I have an idea of how to
get closer to this cab driver.

19:51.850 --> 19:52.770
Let me guess.

19:52.810 --> 19:53.400
You're taking a little trip?

19:54.440 --> 19:55.980
Yes Hi, I'd like to order
a pick up

19:56.020 --> 19:57.280
for about twenty minutes
from now.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.240
And I have a specific cab driver
in mind.

20:04.450 --> 20:05.870
- [Philip] Hi.
- Hi.

20:05.910 --> 20:06.700
- Airport?
- Yeah.

20:07.410 --> 20:08.660
Heading anywhere nice?

20:08.700 --> 20:10.080
Just out of town for the night,
to see a friend.

20:10.870 --> 20:12.080
Be back tomorrow morning.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.790
So your husband got the place
to himself tonight?

20:15.840 --> 20:16.840
Um...

20:17.670 --> 20:19.510
Actually...my, um,

20:20.720 --> 20:22.720
my husband passed away
a few years ago...

20:22.760 --> 20:25.180
I'm sorry for your loss.
I, I didn't mean it...

20:25.220 --> 20:27.850
It's just with, ah...
such a big house.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.430
It's just me in there
with a bunch of,

20:29.470 --> 20:31.810
drab antiques and art.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.270
See that?

20:36.310 --> 20:37.270
See the patience?

20:37.320 --> 20:38.610
People respond to that.

20:38.650 --> 20:40.110
Want some paper,
take a few notes?

20:40.150 --> 20:41.570
You take notes!

20:41.610 --> 20:42.530
What?

20:42.570 --> 20:43.610
That's your come back?

20:43.660 --> 20:44.820
Okay, okay.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.280
What is up with you?

20:46.320 --> 20:47.200
Kids.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.620
Kid, the little she,
the kid.

20:51.660 --> 20:52.580
What are you guys doing here?

20:52.620 --> 20:53.870
It's a long story.

20:53.910 --> 20:56.290
It always seems that way
with you okay, huh?

20:56.330 --> 20:57.250
Jake.

20:57.290 --> 20:57.590
Inspector.

20:58.710 --> 21:00.250
[Leslie]
Are you going to say anything?

21:00.300 --> 21:02.510
Cause if not, you are looking at
a long time.

21:02.550 --> 21:04.130
You and Jake.

21:04.930 --> 21:05.680
You two...

21:06.390 --> 21:07.430
Are a couple right?

21:07.470 --> 21:07.600
Excuse me?

21:08.720 --> 21:11.220
I found a photo of you
in his wallet.

21:11.890 --> 21:12.390
That's so sweet.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.980
He's a decent fella.
He saved my life.

21:16.020 --> 21:17.400
Did you know your mother?

21:17.440 --> 21:18.360
Your father?

21:18.400 --> 21:20.480
Here we go. Psyche 101.

21:20.520 --> 21:24.450
You know, you act pretty tough
for a girl who's up for murder.

21:26.820 --> 21:28.450
Fine, lets proceed.

21:29.530 --> 21:32.080
I knew my mom, a bit.
Not my dad.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.620
They're both dead now and...

21:34.330 --> 21:35.580
Here's some advice.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.840
Mr. Jake doesn't seem
like your type.

21:39.380 --> 21:40.300
Why's that?

21:40.880 --> 21:41.880
I don't know.

21:43.340 --> 21:44.380
He's dangerous.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.260
Which I can totally tell
you're into.

21:47.300 --> 21:48.100
But...

21:48.720 --> 21:51.850
he's also decent.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.730
Like really, really good.

21:56.230 --> 21:58.850
And you seem like you fall for
the not so decent guys.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.770
Well, you know, if you don't
tell me what happened--

22:01.820 --> 22:04.360
How you ended up
with a stolen car,

22:04.400 --> 22:05.490
with a body in the back...

22:05.530 --> 22:07.320
I had nothing to do
with the dead guy.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.030
You're going to end up
in a place

22:09.070 --> 22:11.280
where the only boys
you see for a long time

22:11.330 --> 22:13.580
are the guards on duty,
you got me?

22:22.170 --> 22:23.340
How's it going in there?

22:23.380 --> 22:25.260
She's a tough nut.
Does she have a guardian?

22:25.300 --> 22:26.220
Not really.

22:26.260 --> 22:26.800
We seem to be it.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.050
Do you mind if I go in
and take a shot?

22:31.600 --> 22:32.640
Your call Bennett.

22:33.350 --> 22:34.470
Don't mess this up.

22:38.310 --> 22:40.440
You are seriously
messing up my day.

22:43.650 --> 22:44.900
I'm messing up your day?

22:44.940 --> 22:46.610
I know you didn't kill anyone.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.610
But I need your help
to prove it.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.740
Now you gonna throw me
a bone here. Or what?

22:51.780 --> 22:53.080
No one asked for your help.

22:53.120 --> 22:53.990
Let’s start with the robberies.

22:54.830 --> 22:55.910
So what? You wait for people

22:55.950 --> 22:57.750
to go on vacation
before you rip them off?

22:57.790 --> 23:00.040
That way they won't walk in on
ya while you're pulling a job.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.000
I mean that's,
that's pretty smart.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.590
I'm clever.
What can I say?

23:04.630 --> 23:06.300
So you do it all by yourself
do you?

23:06.340 --> 23:07.380
Yeah.

23:08.300 --> 23:09.220
Really.

23:11.340 --> 23:12.550
Who's this guy?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.220
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

23:15.220 --> 23:15.600
His name his Philip.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.100
And I caught him
trashing your place

23:18.140 --> 23:19.440
looking for all that crap
that you stole.

23:20.810 --> 23:23.440
Now Philip here--
He will throw you under the bus

23:23.480 --> 23:25.150
to save his own skin.

23:25.190 --> 23:28.110
A man is dead,
for something that people think

23:28.150 --> 23:29.530
that you have.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.530
I'll protect you.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.450
I just need your help.

23:38.330 --> 23:40.290
I didn't even want
to steal stuff.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.290
Philip is my ex-boyfriend.
He forced me to do it.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.420
He said we'd get away.

23:46.840 --> 23:49.260
If there's some special item,
he probably has it.

23:53.010 --> 23:54.430
Oh.

23:54.470 --> 23:56.850
So I've been looking into
Cooper's financials.

23:56.890 --> 23:57.350
He hasn't been paid for weeks

23:58.520 --> 24:00.350
and then got a lump sum
from the bank.

24:00.390 --> 24:01.190
Sounds like severance pay.

24:01.230 --> 24:02.480
Why'd he get fired?

24:02.520 --> 24:05.480
Fraud. I talked to Walter,
he owed me a favor.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.820
And apparently the bank has been
investigating Cooper

24:07.860 --> 24:09.990
for stealing two million pounds
by skimming cash deposits.

24:10.030 --> 24:10.650
Wow, that's what
everybody's after.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.570
Two million pounds is like,
over three million Canadian.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.990
That's enough to kill for.

24:16.030 --> 24:17.660
Yeah I'm, I'm gonna text Mal
and Jake and update them.

24:17.700 --> 24:19.250
Do you think that Sloane
found the money?

24:19.290 --> 24:20.830
I don't know. But--

24:20.870 --> 24:23.120
Don't you think it's weird that
Bastion didn't mention this?

24:23.170 --> 24:24.500
Maybe we should take a closer
look at him.

24:24.540 --> 24:25.960
I'm on it.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.960
Oh. And it turns out that
Walter didn't owe me a favor.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.510
So he's coming to dinner
all next week.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.510
Well, you're cooking.

24:32.550 --> 24:34.010
Yes, I will cook.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.870
You must be one of them
bad santas.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.330
Ooof!

25:05.920 --> 25:06.840
Oh...

25:06.880 --> 25:07.840
Get up.

25:09.130 --> 25:10.170
Have a seat.

25:11.590 --> 25:13.800
Now, you're gonna answer--

25:13.840 --> 25:15.180
- [slap]
- Look at me.

25:15.220 --> 25:16.590
You're gonna answer
a few questions,

25:16.640 --> 25:18.050
or I'm gonna skin you alive.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.390
And I'm going to feed you to
a kennel of starvin' dogs.

25:20.430 --> 25:22.350
I don't know what you're talkin
about, alright?

25:22.390 --> 25:23.770
A kennel of starving dogs?

25:23.810 --> 25:24.770
He's a little off today.

25:25.770 --> 25:28.690
What I mean is:
I wanna know:

25:29.440 --> 25:31.110
Did you set the fire,

25:31.150 --> 25:34.490
that nearly killed me, with this
starter fluid from your car?

25:34.530 --> 25:35.320
Oh, like, not anyone
else has that?

25:35.360 --> 25:36.950
[Mal]
That's true. But--

25:36.990 --> 25:39.700
Not many people have a record
for setting four fires with it.

25:39.740 --> 25:41.370
Wait, those files they're
suppose to be sealed alright.

25:41.410 --> 25:42.620
I was in Juvie.

25:42.660 --> 25:44.250
Oh yeah they're sealed
with cops and courts.

25:44.290 --> 25:45.670
But do I look do I look
like a cop?

25:45.710 --> 25:47.500
Does this look like a court?

25:47.540 --> 25:48.580
Open your mouth.

25:48.630 --> 25:49.090
Open your mouth!

25:49.670 --> 25:50.710
Let’s see if

25:50.750 --> 25:52.590
this will set fire
inside of his gut.

25:52.630 --> 25:56.630
Okay, okay. Look, I-- so I lit
the starting fluid

25:56.680 --> 25:58.010
I didn't know it was going
to go up like that.

25:58.050 --> 25:59.760
I was just trying
to scare Sloane.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.470
I found out Sloane
was skimming from me.

26:02.850 --> 26:04.350
That's what I was looking for
at the group home.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.600
My share of the money.

26:07.940 --> 26:09.150
Plus, she broke up with me.

26:10.270 --> 26:12.360
Your share of the
two million pounds?

26:12.400 --> 26:14.110
- Pounds of what?
- [Jake] Pounds. Sterling.

26:14.150 --> 26:15.320
It's British currency.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.280
No look, it was only
two thousand dollars.

26:17.320 --> 26:19.490
What about Cooper? We know
he put two and two together.

26:19.530 --> 26:22.490
And figured you robbed his house
while he was away on vacation.

26:22.540 --> 26:23.790
He confronted you.

26:23.830 --> 26:25.580
And then he forced you
to drive him to Sloane.

26:25.620 --> 26:26.500
- [slap]
- So you killed him?

26:27.710 --> 26:29.460
What? No. That's not what
happened alright.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.960
Look, I did drive him.
But not to Sloane.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.500
He wanted to see some

26:33.550 --> 26:34.420
preppy looking guy at the bank.

26:35.670 --> 26:36.630
And then the two of them got
in a fight and--

26:38.050 --> 26:39.800
I took off and I've been working
nonstop until then.

26:39.840 --> 26:41.260
Check with my dispatcher.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.060
We did. You booked five fares.
You had plenty of time.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.430
You said that Cooper got in
a fight with some preppy guy.

26:47.690 --> 26:48.810
Is it him?

26:48.850 --> 26:49.690
Yeah that's him!

26:50.480 --> 26:51.730
Look I'm sorry alright.

26:51.770 --> 26:53.150
This wasn't supposed to happen.

26:53.190 --> 26:55.400
I was just doing whatever Sloane
was telling me to do.

26:55.940 --> 26:56.780
I loved her.

26:57.320 --> 26:57.360
I'm an idiot.

26:58.860 --> 27:02.660
If Sloane is the one behind all
this, I'm the idiot.

27:02.700 --> 27:03.580
Yes you are.

27:10.710 --> 27:11.750
Yo, you're welcome.

27:12.960 --> 27:14.380
Who's this?

27:14.420 --> 27:16.630
Consider it a welcome back to
work gift. Free collar.

27:16.670 --> 27:18.220
[Jake] He's the guy that set the
fire that almost killed me.

27:18.260 --> 27:20.300
Plus he's a witness
in the Cooper murder.

27:20.340 --> 27:21.890
Where's Leslie?
I phoned this in for her.

27:21.930 --> 27:24.010
She's in the interrogation room.
I'll take him from here.

27:24.060 --> 27:24.930
I want a lawyer.

27:30.140 --> 27:31.020
Jake?

27:32.480 --> 27:33.310
Tell me what's going on.

27:34.270 --> 27:37.400
I'll--
tell ya, over a pint.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.030
or maybe a cigar?

27:41.200 --> 27:46.200
You know just--ignore that.
Just forget I even...

27:48.200 --> 27:48.580
Am I interrupting?

27:49.790 --> 27:51.830
I was just processing
Sloane's paperwork

27:51.870 --> 27:53.710
when I caught her
going through my desk.

27:53.750 --> 27:54.880
Looking for a pen.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.800
Well she's very
sorry.

27:56.840 --> 27:57.170
Aren't you Sloane?

27:58.210 --> 27:59.880
- Whatever.
- You're free to go.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.390
But I don't want to see you
back here again.

28:05.930 --> 28:06.890
[door slams]

28:08.970 --> 28:12.650
That girl is really, really
testing my patience.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.650
Speaking of testing--

28:14.690 --> 28:16.360
Did you happen to
take that little,

28:16.400 --> 28:18.070
you know, test we were gonna
take?

28:19.650 --> 28:22.820
Okay. I just want you to know,
that no matter what happens,

28:22.860 --> 28:25.570
if this happens,

28:25.620 --> 28:29.750
I'm more than,
okay with all of it.

28:31.450 --> 28:35.750
It's okay Jake. We're just gonna
take it one step at a time.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.420
And your car is free to go.

28:41.090 --> 28:42.220
Okay.

28:45.970 --> 28:48.060
We're working on a theory.

28:48.100 --> 28:50.100
- Your former client...
- Bastion?

28:50.140 --> 28:51.930
Yeah. A few of his co-workers
said they saw him

28:51.980 --> 28:54.650
get into a fight with Cooper
right before Cooper died.

28:54.690 --> 28:55.980
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah.

28:56.020 --> 28:59.020
Maybe and Bastion stole
the two million together.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.610
And then Cooper cut Bastion out.

29:00.650 --> 29:02.150
Bastion kills Cooper
and now he's on the run

29:02.190 --> 29:03.400
with the two million pounds.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.990
- Maybe.
- Thanks.

29:08.410 --> 29:09.620
I'll see ya.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.290
[Mal]
Tough day huh?

29:17.330 --> 29:19.130
It's alright
I've had worse.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.260
You wanna talk about it?

29:21.300 --> 29:24.840
No but-- Ummm.
Can I have a hug?

29:25.300 --> 29:26.340
Awww...

29:28.180 --> 29:28.600
[clinking sound]

29:29.350 --> 29:30.350
[Sloane]
That works.

29:30.390 --> 29:31.720
That was smooth.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.890
You know, Bennett should really
lock her desk.

29:34.730 --> 29:36.480
Keys!
Right now, missy!

29:36.520 --> 29:37.610
Sloane,
give me the keys!

29:38.270 --> 29:38.820
Sloane! Watch out!

29:39.820 --> 29:41.820
Officer!
Somebody stop that man!

29:48.870 --> 29:49.700
Jake?

29:49.740 --> 29:50.740
Yeah...

29:50.780 --> 29:52.660
Bastion grabbed her
in the Sedan.

29:52.700 --> 29:54.910
License plate HZP 230.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.170
What direction
were they headed in?

29:56.210 --> 29:57.420
Away from the station.
East.

29:57.460 --> 29:58.290
On it.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.250
[screeching tires]

30:14.520 --> 30:15.770
Son of a bitch!

30:21.190 --> 30:21.520
- Anything?
- No.

30:22.190 --> 30:23.110
That was the group home.

30:23.150 --> 30:24.690
They haven't seen Sloane
all day.

30:24.740 --> 30:27.610
If he got all his items back,
then why did he kidnap Sloane?

30:27.650 --> 30:29.620
Bastion must not have
the stolen money.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.120
Whatever Sloane stole,

30:31.160 --> 30:31.700
it could lead him to the money.

30:31.740 --> 30:33.160
What could it be?

30:33.200 --> 30:35.500
I quadruple checked the list.
We got everything back.

30:35.540 --> 30:36.960
[Jake]
Not everything.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.670
There was one thing on the list
that Bastion didn't get.

30:39.330 --> 30:40.540
[Mal]
The frame.

30:40.580 --> 30:42.460
Maybe Sloane stole this
from Cooper's house.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.550
What's so valuable about it?

30:43.590 --> 30:44.710
[Bastion]
Apt question.

30:48.510 --> 30:49.550
[Sloan coughing]

30:49.590 --> 30:50.510
[Mal]
Sloane.

30:50.550 --> 30:51.470
Where is she?

30:51.510 --> 30:52.850
- She's fine.
- She better be.

30:52.890 --> 30:56.430
Whoa. You guys need to learn
how to relax. Seriously.

30:56.470 --> 30:58.690
Why don't you put that gun down
and we'll talk about it.

30:58.730 --> 31:00.270
You're hysterical.

31:00.310 --> 31:02.400
So here's the deal.
The girl's fine.

31:02.440 --> 31:03.900
But she's gonna need you
to get there soon,

31:04.650 --> 31:05.530
or she won't be.

31:06.190 --> 31:07.360
Toss me the frame.

31:10.070 --> 31:10.780
Des.

31:11.370 --> 31:12.580
[Sloan coughing]

31:24.670 --> 31:24.710
Thanks.

31:26.380 --> 31:27.800
You know I really gotta commend
you guys on your diligence.

31:29.130 --> 31:31.550
You get fired from the job,
yet you finish it.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.100
I'll send you the address
where to find her.

31:34.930 --> 31:36.180
Keep an eye on your phone.

31:37.390 --> 31:37.730
Des.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.520
You follow that
piece of crap.

31:40.100 --> 31:41.230
[message sound]

31:41.270 --> 31:43.060
Alright. I got the address.
Let’s go.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.750
Jake! Faster!

32:04.790 --> 32:06.210
Hang on Dad by we'll get there,
we'll get there.

32:07.340 --> 32:09.510
If Leslie's pregnant,
you should know:

32:09.550 --> 32:11.220
You're a good man.
You'd be a great Dad.

32:11.260 --> 32:12.800
Are you after going soft
in the head or something?

32:12.840 --> 32:14.550
I say one nice thing!

32:14.590 --> 32:16.050
I'm just saying you could have
lost your mind.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.270
It happens to people,
especially your age.

32:18.310 --> 32:21.140
Okay, you'd be a terrible dad.
You happy now?

32:22.850 --> 32:24.560
[tires squealing]

32:28.900 --> 32:30.320
[Mal]
This is the address.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.570
[Jake]
She better be here.

32:36.410 --> 32:37.330
[Sloane coughing]

32:37.370 --> 32:38.490
I'll check the side door.

32:43.540 --> 32:44.880
[glass breaking]

32:46.920 --> 32:50.050
[coughing]

32:55.890 --> 32:57.930
[Jake coughs]

32:59.720 --> 33:00.850
You okay?

33:00.890 --> 33:02.480
[coughing]

33:03.480 --> 33:04.850
Hang on, hang on.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.310
[coughing]

33:10.900 --> 33:12.070
[clicking sound]

33:20.660 --> 33:22.080
Just duck your head.

33:22.120 --> 33:23.160
[tires squealing]

33:23.620 --> 33:25.000
[crash]

33:35.470 --> 33:36.640
Everyone okay?

33:37.850 --> 33:38.260
Fine.

33:39.010 --> 33:40.350
Yeah.
She'll live.

33:41.180 --> 33:42.480
Thanks for the save.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.810
[Jake]
Listen carefully,

33:44.850 --> 33:46.770
the guy who locked you
in that garage...

33:46.810 --> 33:48.900
Bastion. Did he tell you
anything?

33:48.940 --> 33:50.480
He was just asking
about some stupid frame.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.530
I told him you guys had it.

33:51.570 --> 33:52.280
What did he want with it?

33:52.320 --> 33:53.610
Unless he had some

33:53.650 --> 33:55.320
weird obsession with that photo
of my Mom in it--

33:55.360 --> 33:56.160
Nothing. I don't know.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.570
Where'd you get that frame?

33:57.610 --> 34:00.080
I may have borrowed it from that
dead guy, Clark's house.

34:00.660 --> 34:02.500
[phone rings]

34:02.540 --> 34:03.750
It's Rose. Yeah?

34:03.790 --> 34:04.710
I examined the photos

34:04.750 --> 34:05.910
Des took of the frame.

34:05.960 --> 34:06.920
[Jake]
What'd you find?

34:06.960 --> 34:08.210
[Rose]
A tiny hole built into it.

34:08.250 --> 34:09.750
- What for?
- A lens.

34:09.790 --> 34:10.710
There was a hidden camera
in the picture frame?

34:11.550 --> 34:13.090
[Mal]
So Bastion must have

34:13.130 --> 34:15.420
planted it in Cooper's house
to record something. But what?

34:15.470 --> 34:17.340
Hopefully not the old guy
doing it.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.850
[Jake] Thanks Rose,
I'll call you back.

34:20.890 --> 34:24.140
Whatever it was,
he was looking for something.

34:37.110 --> 34:38.110
Ah!

34:38.160 --> 34:39.620
You're good
with computers, right?

34:49.080 --> 34:49.960
Okay, hold on b'y,
hold on.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.040
Can you fix it?

34:51.080 --> 34:54.630
Yes! Just, just,
just give me a second.

34:58.010 --> 35:01.640
Okay, okay. Yeah that should do
it the memory was corrupt.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.430
You know I'd love it

35:03.470 --> 35:04.390
if you weren't
pointing that thing at me.

35:04.430 --> 35:05.520
Consider it a warning.

35:05.560 --> 35:06.810
Meaning, you better hope
this works.

35:06.850 --> 35:07.730
It does. Just look.

35:08.560 --> 35:09.520
You know,
I gotta say--

35:10.690 --> 35:12.110
you should really stop
abusing people.

35:12.150 --> 35:13.150
It's going to come back to you.

35:13.190 --> 35:15.150
Thanks for that. Really.

35:15.190 --> 35:16.490
Okay, okay.

35:16.530 --> 35:17.530
[sound of car door]

35:24.200 --> 35:25.490
Where did you get it exactly?

35:25.540 --> 35:26.330
Right here.

35:27.330 --> 35:28.920
And which way
was it pointed?

35:29.460 --> 35:29.500
Right there.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.290
Maybe Cooper was seeing someone
he shouldn't of been.

35:33.330 --> 35:35.630
And Bastion wanted some
evidence, to blackmail him.

35:36.340 --> 35:37.340
[Sloane]
Good scam.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.260
Yeah.
I got a feeling...

35:40.300 --> 35:42.260
This would be a little more
profitable.

35:42.300 --> 35:43.970
You guys really don't know
when to stop.

35:44.010 --> 35:45.060
Bastion, put the gun down.

35:45.100 --> 35:45.220
Shut up!

35:46.810 --> 35:49.310
Now I'm gonna take that money.
And I'm getting out of here.

35:49.350 --> 35:51.150
Buddy you killed your boss
and you nearly killed her.

35:52.610 --> 35:54.520
You think we're gonna just let
you walk out of here?

35:54.560 --> 35:56.900
We know you planted that camera
in Cooper's house.

35:56.940 --> 35:59.110
To rob him, before he cut you
out of the deal.

35:59.150 --> 36:00.150
Then Sloane stole the camera.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.570
Sorry about that.

36:01.610 --> 36:03.660
Cooper and I were together to
pull the whole plan off.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.160
And yeah,
he tried to cut me out.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.200
What else could I have done?

36:07.240 --> 36:08.410
Not kill him?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.160
Unlock the safe.

36:11.710 --> 36:12.920
Code's on there.

36:14.250 --> 36:15.380
Do you know how to work this?

36:23.090 --> 36:26.260
[beeping]

36:30.730 --> 36:31.730
Not a bad pay-day.

36:31.770 --> 36:32.770
And well deserved.

36:34.020 --> 36:34.900
Fill it.

36:38.400 --> 36:39.780
[sound of zipper]

36:42.610 --> 36:43.570
Dad.

36:49.290 --> 36:49.660
Okay guys, come on.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.460
Now there's enough money
in there for all of us.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.080
Why don't you just, just take
your share and I walk?

36:55.130 --> 36:57.040
- What do you say?
- Ah, sold.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.130
I wasn't talking to you.

36:58.710 --> 36:59.960
That's too bad.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.010
Because we would have made
a really good team.

37:02.050 --> 37:04.380
I mean I'm older than I look,
and a little wiser.

37:04.430 --> 37:05.340
Kid, get the hell--
Oh!

37:06.600 --> 37:08.970
Okay, that's, that's quite
enough of that.

37:09.010 --> 37:10.390
That had to hurt.

37:10.430 --> 37:13.270
Look Pally. You really did have
this coming. Get up.

37:17.190 --> 37:18.520
Now what--

37:18.570 --> 37:19.610
Where's Sloane?

37:20.650 --> 37:21.740
[Jake]
She took the Money.

37:21.780 --> 37:22.820
Stay with him.

37:28.570 --> 37:30.660
You know, they need to put
a bell on you, or something.

37:30.700 --> 37:33.290
Wait! Please don't
run again okay?

37:33.330 --> 37:34.710
I'm still sore
from the last time.

37:34.750 --> 37:35.670
And then Jake is going to have
to do all the running.

37:35.710 --> 37:36.880
And I'm going to
get fired.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.000
Not my problem.

37:38.040 --> 37:38.920
Hey, hey, hey.

37:38.960 --> 37:39.000
I'm sorry. Look.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.170
I know you had a rough go.
But the Doyles

37:42.210 --> 37:43.260
they wanna help you.

37:43.300 --> 37:44.550
I don't need their help, Slim.

37:48.510 --> 37:49.510
Where you headed?

37:49.550 --> 37:50.600
Would you believe a sleepover?

37:50.640 --> 37:51.520
No.

37:52.180 --> 37:53.230
Give me the bag.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.310
Bastion's plan wasn't that bad,

37:58.360 --> 37:59.940
if you want to take off
and let me go.

38:00.820 --> 38:01.730
Fine.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.860
Really?

38:04.900 --> 38:07.160
Just be prepared to always be
looking over your shoulder.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.490
'Cause the cops will never
leave you alone.

38:08.530 --> 38:09.620
I'm not afraid of the cops.

38:09.660 --> 38:09.700
You're right.

38:10.990 --> 38:12.620
The cops will be the least
of your problems.

38:12.660 --> 38:13.870
And with your attitude

38:13.910 --> 38:15.750
and bad habits
and all that money,

38:15.790 --> 38:18.330
you're gonna attract
the worst kind of people.

38:18.380 --> 38:18.750
Look at me.

38:19.960 --> 38:20.750
And you exactly
what I'm talking about.

38:22.130 --> 38:24.340
It's not like I have
much of a choice Jake. Do I?

38:26.220 --> 38:26.300
Let’s make a deal.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.890
If you stick around, I promise
I'll always be here.

38:31.050 --> 38:34.060
If you call me, I'll show up.
Simple.

38:34.730 --> 38:35.850
What do you think?

38:35.890 --> 38:37.600
Think it's time you start
trusting someone?

38:39.150 --> 38:40.270
I got you something.

38:42.820 --> 38:43.730
Take it.

38:43.780 --> 38:44.900
My number's programmed inside.

38:44.940 --> 38:45.860
Mine too.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.780
I guess, we can try things
your way.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.870
[Jake] I think you
might also want this.

39:07.220 --> 39:08.090
What's this?

39:09.430 --> 39:13.470
Folic acid?
Prenatal vitamins?

39:14.680 --> 39:17.890
Yeah. I know your
supposed to take them,

39:17.930 --> 39:20.400
like ten months before you
actually get preggers, but...

39:21.860 --> 39:24.690
You know I wanted to--
I wanted to get you something.

39:26.650 --> 39:29.660
And I got no idea what I'm at
here Leslie b'y.

39:32.950 --> 39:36.410
That's really thoughtful of you.
But I'm not pregnant.

39:44.710 --> 39:45.670
Are you sure?

39:46.260 --> 39:47.340
Is that okay?

39:50.180 --> 39:51.340
You look sad.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.800
Well, you know,

39:54.850 --> 39:59.890
forgive me for wanting to be
forever linked through eternity

39:59.940 --> 40:01.900
through our offspring.

40:02.770 --> 40:05.320
But ah, yeah maybe a little.

40:07.860 --> 40:10.360
I figure the more babies
I make ya have now

40:10.400 --> 40:12.410
the harder it'll be for you
to leave me later on,

40:12.450 --> 40:13.530
which is inevitable.

40:14.570 --> 40:16.620
Pure strategy on my part.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.920
You're going to be an amazing
Dad you know, it's just...

40:27.420 --> 40:28.300
Not now.

40:30.630 --> 40:31.510
Okay?

40:36.140 --> 40:39.600
Go on now,
I've got work to do.

40:41.270 --> 40:44.020
It's the weekend. Do you
wanna...? What do we...?

40:44.940 --> 40:46.610
Shouldn't we have plans or...?

40:47.820 --> 40:49.320
I just got this work
dinner thing.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.030
It's nothing
you gotta worry about.

40:52.910 --> 40:54.030
You're free.

40:55.410 --> 40:57.200
Good. Great.

41:02.790 --> 41:04.080
I'll talk to you after.

41:17.140 --> 41:18.430
We would like two glasses
of champagne, Ned.

41:19.140 --> 41:20.560
What's the celebration?

41:20.600 --> 41:22.730
You're looking at the newest Big
Brother in St. John's.

41:22.770 --> 41:23.890
Well congrats.
What are your parents gonna

41:23.940 --> 41:24.940
name the kid?

41:24.980 --> 41:25.690
No. I signed up with
a group home.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.610
That deserves champagne?

41:27.650 --> 41:29.860
That's more like a club soda
type celebration.

41:29.900 --> 41:31.320
Just get the drinks Ned.

41:31.860 --> 41:33.150
Thank you.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.110
Don't mind him.

41:35.450 --> 41:36.780
I'm so proud of you.

41:37.570 --> 41:38.370
Thanks.

41:39.950 --> 41:41.790
So what's this I hear about you
hanging out with my uncle?

41:42.950 --> 41:44.120
More like making an ass
out of myself?

41:45.670 --> 41:47.840
I don't know. I guess I was,
just trying to impress him.

41:48.590 --> 41:49.840
[Tinny]
What? Why?

41:50.750 --> 41:51.880
Because he's important to you.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.300
And you're important to me.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.760
Well, that's pretty sweet.
But completely unnecessary.

41:57.890 --> 41:59.560
I don't care what Jake
thinks of you.

42:02.350 --> 42:03.890
[Mal]
You started already without us?

42:03.930 --> 42:05.480
Oh, just getting warmed up hun.

42:06.350 --> 42:07.690
We're gonna go get a table.

42:11.820 --> 42:13.740
Grandchildren in my future?

42:16.610 --> 42:17.490
No.

42:19.780 --> 42:21.120
Likely for the best.

42:21.740 --> 42:22.830
You're hilarious.

42:26.580 --> 42:27.790
[clink of glasses]
