03:30.109 --> 03:35.103
- Where've you been keeping yourself?
- Here and there. Here and there.

03:37.617 --> 03:41.178
So it's not because our service
is bad, huh?

03:41.654 --> 03:43.417
What a day!

03:44.157 --> 03:47.388
You ever see such a glorious day?

03:47.961 --> 03:51.294
Come on, say hello to Helen.

03:58.805 --> 04:04.209
You old son of a gun. lt's wonderful
to see you again. You look great.

04:04.410 --> 04:06.344
Well, so do you.

04:06.512 --> 04:11.540
- Well, a little green around the edges.
- l drank too much last night.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.287
l don't believe it. Neddy!

04:14.287 --> 04:15.413
l don't believe it. Neddy!

04:20.526 --> 04:26.192
How beautiful are thy feet in sandals,
O princess daughter.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.904
l bet you drank too much last night.

04:37.076 --> 04:42.742
- lsn't he a sight for sore eyes?
- Oh, Neddy, we missed you.

04:42.982 --> 04:45.143
Sit down and tell us everything.

04:45.318 --> 04:47.980
- Where are you coming from?
- l was around.

04:48.154 --> 04:52.955
l thought l'd come over and have a
swim with you. Look at that water.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.158
- And look at that sky.
- You look at it.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.854
l think everybody drank too much
last night.

04:59.032 --> 05:02.001
lt was that rum,
l drank too much of that.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.863
- Whose party?
- Our own.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.700
- You didn't miss a thing.
- Usual Saturday night blowout.

05:07.874 --> 05:13.073
Same jokes, same faces, we've known
each other so long there's no flirting.

05:13.279 --> 05:17.272
- l'd have flirted with you.
- You're practically a new face.

05:17.483 --> 05:21.442
- How are things? Have a good summer?
- Sure, just great.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.612
Come on, how about a swim?

05:23.790 --> 05:25.883
Good for your hangover.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.527
What makes you think l'm hung-over?

05:28.728 --> 05:31.288
- Come on, l'll race you.
- Please, no.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.431
- How about you?
- You kidding?

05:33.633 --> 05:36.568
Relax, Neddy. Have a drink. Come on.

05:36.736 --> 05:39.637
- Sit and tell us what you've learned.
- Ned!

05:39.806 --> 05:41.574
Stu Forsburgh!

05:41.574 --> 05:42.199
Stu Forsburgh!

05:42.375 --> 05:47.142
- Ned Merrill! How are you, sport?
- Okay, never better.

05:47.380 --> 05:51.316
- God, l'm glad to see you.
- What are you doing here?

05:51.517 --> 05:54.247
We stopped over.
We've been in the Cape.

05:54.420 --> 05:56.479
- How's Lucinda?
- She's great.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.123
And the girls?

05:58.291 --> 06:02.387
All grown up. And beautiful, Stu.
Just beautiful.

06:02.562 --> 06:06.225
l don't know how you do it!
You haven't changed a bit.

06:06.432 --> 06:10.801
Where did you get this?
Why do you got all these clothes on?

06:10.970 --> 06:13.336
We have to go catch a plane.

06:13.539 --> 06:17.805
- You're gonna catch a plane?
- Gotta get back to the shop.

06:20.113 --> 06:23.947
You know how long it's been since
we had a swim together?

06:24.117 --> 06:27.314
- Please don't remind me.
- What'll you have, Stu?

06:27.487 --> 06:32.424
We're all old bunkmates. We went to
the same camp when we were kids.

06:32.592 --> 06:36.619
Gee, l don't know.
l drank too much last night.

06:36.796 --> 06:39.321
- A diluted martini?
- l'm out of practice...

06:39.565 --> 06:41.795
...with your kind of parties.

06:41.968 --> 06:45.096
We don't do that in Columbus,
unless it's New Year's Eve.

06:45.271 --> 06:49.367
- l told you not to accept the transfer.
- What else could l do?

06:49.609 --> 06:53.136
l'd have quit before l let them
send me to the provinces.

06:53.312 --> 06:55.212
Well, it's healthy.

06:55.948 --> 06:57.711
Stu, did you pack...?

06:57.950 --> 07:01.078
Don't tell me that's Ned Merrill
down there.

07:01.287 --> 07:05.189
- Hi, honeybunch, come join the party.
- Half a minute.

07:05.391 --> 07:09.987
Stu, l didn't realize how much
l missed that ugly old mug of yours.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.724
Get out of those clothes
and we'll have one quick swim.

07:13.900 --> 07:19.634
- l'm not up to it. l'm feeling my age.
- You're a year younger than l am.

07:19.806 --> 07:24.709
Yeah, you were always
pulling seniority on me at camp.

07:24.911 --> 07:28.472
Remember how we'd take off
our suits and swim for miles?

07:28.648 --> 07:30.878
- We just never got tired.
- Yeah.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.985
We had nice,
new, pink lungs in those days.

07:34.153 --> 07:39.352
And the water up there, remember?
That transparent light-green water.

07:39.525 --> 07:44.986
lt felt different. A beautiful feeling.
We could've swum around the world.

07:45.198 --> 07:48.690
That was before we ever touched
a drink or a cigarette.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.563
- Or a girl!
- Or a girl.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.897
That doesn't sap a man's strength.

07:53.072 --> 07:56.235
- Or l'd be in a wheelchair today.
- Ned Merrill!

07:56.409 --> 07:59.867
- Peggy.
- Ned Merrill, still bragging.

08:00.046 --> 08:03.743
l've heard those old schoolboy stories.
You all made them up.

08:03.916 --> 08:07.875
So you figured that one out,
have you? Let me look at you.

08:08.354 --> 08:10.948
Let's settle this nonsense
about taking a plane.

08:11.157 --> 08:15.958
- Settle it with him. l like it here.
- Lucinda'll be disappointed as hell.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.562
l don't think that's exactly true.

08:18.764 --> 08:21.631
l could run you to our house.
To say hello.

08:21.801 --> 08:25.259
- Don, how about using your car?
- Well, sure, but...

08:25.438 --> 08:30.432
They haven't time. We promised to
stop at the Grahams' for a quick drink.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.044
- Will you come?
- Of course he will.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.770
- You haven't seen their pool, have you?
- Whose?

08:35.948 --> 08:38.746
- The Grahams.
- The Grahams put in a pool?

08:38.918 --> 08:41.784
Oh, yeah. They nurse it like a baby.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.879
- When did they put in a pool?
- June.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.625
- June?
- Did you get the suits off the line?

08:49.795 --> 08:51.422
l forgot about them.

08:51.597 --> 08:54.430
lf they're damp, l have
some plastic bags.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.625
Do the Biswangers have a pool?

08:56.836 --> 09:01.068
- Biswangers?
- Those awful people on Red Coat Road.

09:01.240 --> 09:05.939
Always talking about their Caribbean
cruises and electric toothbrushes.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.136
Sure, they have a big pool.

09:08.314 --> 09:12.808
- Go on, honey, finish packing.
- l will, in a minute.

09:12.985 --> 09:18.355
- Listen, if we miss that plane...
- Don't worry, l'll get you to the airport.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.455
My God, l forgot all about them.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.757
Go on, honey, finish packing.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.499
- lf we miss that plane...
- l will, in a minute.

09:32.738 --> 09:32.838
l could do it. l could really do it!

09:32.838 --> 09:36.171
l could do it. l could really do it!

09:36.375 --> 09:37.808
Do what, Neddy?

09:38.544 --> 09:40.011
Now with the Grahams'...

09:40.179 --> 09:43.945
...there's a string of pools that curves
clear across the county to our house.

09:44.116 --> 09:49.748
Well, look, the Grahams', the Lears',
the Bunkers'. Then over the ridge.

09:49.956 --> 09:55.895
A portage through the riding ring,
to the Hallorans' and the Gilmartins'.

09:56.629 --> 10:00.121
Then down the lane
to the Biswangers' and then...

10:01.901 --> 10:07.271
Wait, who's next? l can't think.
l had it a minute ago. Who is it?

10:09.275 --> 10:11.903
Who is it?
Who's next to the Biswangers'?

10:12.144 --> 10:16.137
- Shirley Abbott.
- Shirley Abbott.

10:16.816 --> 10:23.312
Across Route 424 to the recreation
center pool, up the hill and l'm home.

10:30.396 --> 10:36.062
Don't you see? l just figured it out.
lf l take a dogleg to the southwest...

10:36.402 --> 10:38.870
...l can swim home.

10:39.038 --> 10:41.836
Come on, Ned.

10:43.509 --> 10:47.206
- Why would you want to swim home?
- l don't get it.

10:47.380 --> 10:52.079
Pool by pool, they form a river
all the way to our house.

10:52.318 --> 10:58.780
l suppose you could put it that way.
Now, Neddy, why don't you sit down...

10:58.958 --> 11:03.361
...and have a drink
and then we'll all go to the Grahams'?

11:03.529 --> 11:07.090
l'll call it the Lucinda River,
after my wife.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.257
That's quite a tribute.

11:09.435 --> 11:13.769
This is the day Ned Merrill
swims across the county.

11:18.744 --> 11:22.976
Always threw himself in the water
like that. God, what energy!

11:23.149 --> 11:24.980
He keeps himself in shape.

11:25.151 --> 11:28.643
Come on. He always ate like a horse,
never put on an ounce.

11:30.222 --> 11:35.819
- Look at that. Wouldn't use the ladder.
- Hey, Ned! Where are you going?

11:35.995 --> 11:38.156
Where'd he get that nutty idea?

11:38.397 --> 11:40.763
- He's just joking.
- You sure?

11:40.933 --> 11:44.630
Sure. We'll find him waiting for us
at the Grahams'.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.931
God, l hate Columbus.

11:47.106 --> 11:51.304
Swim to his house.
Why would he wanna do that?

11:54.113 --> 11:58.777
Neddy, Neddy! lt's been so long.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.112
- You look wonderful.
- So do you.

12:01.287 --> 12:04.017
l'm going on a diet
a week from Thursday.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.522
- Where were you?
- Don and Helen's.

12:06.692 --> 12:11.129
Where are they all?
They're all coming over, aren't they?

12:11.297 --> 12:15.097
- Why didn't they come with you?
- They're driving down.

12:17.136 --> 12:20.628
- What do you think?
- Terrific. Absolutely terrific.

12:20.806 --> 12:26.267
lt cost a bundle,
but Howie's had a marvelous year.

12:27.046 --> 12:30.504
- Look how clear the water is.
- Wow!

12:30.683 --> 12:33.777
We got the best filter money can buy.

12:33.953 --> 12:39.482
lt filters 99.99.99 percent
of all solid matter out of the water.

12:39.658 --> 12:43.560
- Really?
- We put a 6-inch lint filter in too.

12:43.796 --> 12:48.358
The way we take care of this pool,
the water's purer than drinking water.

12:49.001 --> 12:52.164
- What'll you have?
- Scoop me a glass of that.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.863
- Don't be silly. Want a martini?
- No, nothing, thanks.

12:56.041 --> 13:00.307
- l'll swim and be on my way.
- You will not. You just got here.

13:00.513 --> 13:03.346
l can't stay.
l want to try out your pool.

13:03.549 --> 13:08.953
- That's unfriendly. What's the rush?
- Okay, but make it a little one.

13:09.155 --> 13:12.181
Next summer
we're gonna build a pool house.

13:12.358 --> 13:19.093
With dressing rooms and showers
and a little playroom and a big bar.

13:19.265 --> 13:22.701
Make a swell layout. Cheers.

13:30.042 --> 13:32.909
You never thought he'd make it,
did you?

13:33.479 --> 13:34.969
Who?

13:35.681 --> 13:40.175
When we were kids and
l first started dating Howard...

13:40.352 --> 13:44.379
...you weren't very nice to him.
- l wasn't, why?

13:45.791 --> 13:50.956
Remember he kept track of every penny
he saved and spent in a notebook.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.860
You thought that was very amusing.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.898
l was jealous.

13:56.602 --> 13:58.593
Of Howard?

13:59.738 --> 14:02.229
l was crazy about you.

14:03.409 --> 14:07.038
Well, you never said anything.

14:10.049 --> 14:15.385
- You were having an affair with Lucinda.
- Why'd l get smashed at your wedding?

14:15.554 --> 14:19.251
Because Lucinda was dancing
with Roger Bunker.

14:19.458 --> 14:22.950
What a long memory you got,
grandma.

14:23.329 --> 14:27.265
No kidding though.
You've got a gorgeous pool.

14:27.433 --> 14:30.596
l've got everything l ever wanted.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.237
Funny how things turn out,
isn't it?

14:33.405 --> 14:36.169
- Hey, Ned!
- Howard.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.401
- How are you, Ned?
- Fine, fine.

14:38.577 --> 14:40.568
Of all people.

14:40.746 --> 14:44.944
- How do you like my new toy?
- Next year we're getting all the optionals.

14:45.117 --> 14:48.177
Like a padded seat, a canopy.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.254
She's idling a bit slow.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.117
ldling?

14:55.661 --> 14:58.323
lt's not supposed to be
a racing engine.

14:58.497 --> 15:01.364
- What's he doing?
- He's fixing it.

15:01.567 --> 15:05.367
- lt's okay now.
- l'll get you a drink.

15:06.972 --> 15:08.701
- lt's a great pool.
- Yeah.

15:08.874 --> 15:11.104
Ned's just crazy about our pool.

15:11.277 --> 15:12.938
l didn't skimp on it.

15:13.112 --> 15:16.138
- l got a diatomaceous earth filter.
- Betty told me.

15:16.315 --> 15:20.342
Filters out 99.99.99 percent...

15:20.519 --> 15:23.818
...of all solid matter.
- That's what Betty said.

15:23.989 --> 15:26.822
She tell you about
the swing joints l got in there?

15:26.992 --> 15:31.725
Spingon's pool split down the middle
three months after the guarantee.

15:31.897 --> 15:35.060
- No swing joints.
- Ned doesn't know the Spingons.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.293
Let me tell you about them.

15:37.469 --> 15:42.600
- They're the kind of people who skimp.
- Just look at the color of that sky.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.137
l don't like the look of that cloud.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.304
lt's beautiful.

15:49.481 --> 15:56.216
Like a dream city from the bow
of a ship. Lisbon, Naples, lstanbul.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.686
Hackensack.

16:00.125 --> 16:04.221
l'd like to see all those glistening
white domes and minarets.

16:04.563 --> 16:09.523
First chance l get to get away,
l'll go sailing around the Golden Horn.

16:09.735 --> 16:12.260
Why can't we travel more?

16:12.438 --> 16:15.373
What for? We've got everything
we want right here.

16:16.241 --> 16:20.575
- How come you never put a pool in?
- Never got around to it.

16:20.746 --> 16:23.579
That's too bad.
Helps the resale value.

16:23.749 --> 16:26.843
l don't have to worry about
the resale value.

16:27.019 --> 16:32.457
With a tennis court and the planting,
you'll get a lot more than you paid.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.091
lf l ever sell it.

16:34.259 --> 16:39.094
- Right buyer has to come along.
- l want my girls to be married there.

16:41.967 --> 16:46.768
Won't be long now. Our driveway
looked like a parking lot today.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.430
Boys all over the place.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.800
Hey, anybody home?

16:53.312 --> 16:58.045
That must be Don and Helen with
the Forsburghs. Neddy, don't go away.

16:58.217 --> 16:59.741
- Hi, Betty.
- So long, Ned.

16:59.918 --> 17:01.442
ls Ned here?

17:14.299 --> 17:18.827
- Mrs. Hammar, how are you?
- May l ask what you're doing here?

17:19.605 --> 17:22.267
On my way home,
l thought l'd cool off.

17:22.441 --> 17:25.637
Who gave you permission
to use the pool?

17:25.810 --> 17:30.407
l'm Ned Merrill. Beautiful flowers.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.741
l see Eric's put in the rock garden.

17:34.453 --> 17:38.014
- You're not welcome here.
- You know me, don't you?

17:38.223 --> 17:41.420
- l'm a friend of your son.
- A friend.

17:41.593 --> 17:46.326
How dare you use that word!
You never came to see him.

17:46.498 --> 17:49.592
You never even called him
at the hospital.

17:51.537 --> 17:55.530
Well, how is he? ls he better?

18:06.318 --> 18:09.378
Just one minute, Mr. Merrill.

18:09.555 --> 18:12.149
This is my house now.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.523
Don't you ever come here again.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.892
Don't you ever set foot
on my property again!

21:07.833 --> 21:09.391
Hi, Mr. Merrill.

21:09.568 --> 21:12.969
- Hi, Muffie.
- Mommy and Daddy are at the club.

21:13.138 --> 21:17.165
- Think they'd mind if l swim?
- Of course not, help yourself.

21:29.021 --> 21:32.252
- lt isn't Julie Ann Hooper?
- Yes, it is.

21:32.491 --> 21:36.928
l can't believe it.
You're all grown up.

21:37.095 --> 21:41.498
- How come we never see you?
- l guess you don't need me anymore.

21:41.667 --> 21:44.761
We're always looking for a babysitter.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.565
Oh, Mr. Merrill!

21:51.476 --> 21:54.104
- How about Sunday night? You busy?
- No.

21:54.279 --> 21:56.611
Hired. You live in the same place?

21:56.782 --> 21:58.579
- Yes, but...
- l'll pick you up at 7.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.378
- You're putting me on.
- No, l'm not.

22:01.553 --> 22:07.014
A babysitter! Ellen and Aggie
would have a fit if they heard you.

22:10.929 --> 22:14.387
Mr. Merrill,
this is my brother, Vernon.

22:14.566 --> 22:17.091
Your brother? But your brother was...

22:17.269 --> 22:20.204
l sure liked that little red Jaguar
you used to have.

22:20.372 --> 22:22.237
- Want a Coke?
- Sure.

22:22.441 --> 22:26.810
Thanks. l can't get over you, Julie.
How old are you now?

22:27.012 --> 22:30.277
- Twenty last month.
- You still going to school?

22:30.449 --> 22:33.316
- l've got a job.
- l miss Ellen and Aggie.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.544
- Where are they?
- They're home.

22:37.322 --> 22:40.780
- Playing tennis.
- They are? But when did they...?

22:40.959 --> 22:42.950
Why didn't they call me?

22:43.161 --> 22:46.460
l'd just love to see them.
Let's drive over.

22:46.631 --> 22:49.122
Well, l've got to be on my way.

22:49.301 --> 22:52.134
- l'm swimming home.
- You're swimming home?

22:52.337 --> 22:55.135
There's a river of pools
all the way to my house.

22:55.307 --> 22:59.073
- That's more hiking than swimming.
- Not hiking. Portaging.

22:59.244 --> 23:02.805
- lt's okay, if you like exercise.
- What a crazy idea.

23:02.981 --> 23:06.644
- l think it's brilliant.
- From here l go to the Bunkers'.

23:06.818 --> 23:09.844
l'll portage through the riding ring
to the Hallorans'.

23:10.088 --> 23:12.784
- Got it all mapped out.
- What are you doing it for?

23:12.991 --> 23:16.085
- Why do you want to?
- l think it's original.

23:16.294 --> 23:20.663
As if he's...
an explorer or something.

23:22.634 --> 23:25.603
l mean, l think it's an adventure.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.268
Come with me.

23:29.941 --> 23:32.705
- Well, gee, l...
- Come on, live a little.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.311
l don't know if...

23:34.479 --> 23:38.313
We'll explore the torrential
headwaters of the Lucinda River.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.579
All right, l will.

23:48.326 --> 23:50.954
Ready! Go!

24:23.695 --> 24:25.754
- lt's funny.
- What?

24:25.931 --> 24:29.890
- Marigolds. This time of the year.
- They're all over.

24:30.068 --> 24:35.404
- Well, they usually bloom later.
- They're lovely. l love the colors.

24:38.009 --> 24:39.772
Mr. Merrill?

24:40.579 --> 24:44.948
What did you mean before?
All that about my coming to babysit.

24:45.150 --> 24:50.679
Coming over to babysit?
l was just joking. l was teasing you.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.653
Gee, l wondered.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.620
You used to be such a shy little kid.

24:55.794 --> 25:00.424
You always brought schoolbooks.
You always dropped pencils and things.

25:00.599 --> 25:02.931
And you never had a word to say.

25:03.101 --> 25:06.229
- l thought plenty, though.
- About what?

25:06.404 --> 25:10.238
- Oh, daydreamed.
- What about?

25:10.408 --> 25:13.377
- Lots of things.
- What sort of things?

25:13.545 --> 25:19.040
- lt's so silly, it was such kid stuff.
- Come on, tell me.

25:19.684 --> 25:23.484
l bet you never knew
l had a big crush on you.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.246
You did?

25:25.457 --> 25:30.588
- l was mad about you, out of my head!
- You were?

25:30.929 --> 25:35.298
lf Mrs. Merrill called me to babysit,
even at the last minute...

25:35.467 --> 25:39.233
...l'd cancel out whoever l promised
and come to your house instead.

25:39.404 --> 25:41.770
You must have lost
a lot of customers.

25:41.940 --> 25:47.810
l'd spend an hour getting myself fixed
up. My mother thought l was nuts.

25:47.979 --> 25:52.177
l mean, l was just a kid to you,
but you were a god to me.

25:52.350 --> 25:56.946
- Now you're putting me on.
- Know what l'd do as the girls slept?

25:57.122 --> 26:01.616
l'd go up to your room and open
your closet and touch your suits.

26:01.793 --> 26:07.288
Then l'd go into your bathroom and
smell your shaving lotion. One time...

26:07.465 --> 26:10.093
- This is a terrible thing to admit.
- Tell me.

26:10.268 --> 26:12.498
l stole one of your shirts.

26:12.671 --> 26:17.267
Then when l was doing my homework
up in my room, l'd put it on.

26:17.442 --> 26:20.468
lt made me feel as if
you were all around me.

26:20.645 --> 26:23.478
Julie, l didn't know.

26:23.648 --> 26:27.812
And when you'd drive me home
at night, l'd pretend like mad.

26:27.986 --> 26:31.513
Pretend what?
What was it you used to pretend?

26:31.690 --> 26:36.389
l... After all,
l was just a child in those days.

26:36.561 --> 26:38.188
l want to know.

26:39.965 --> 26:45.198
That you were desperately
in love with me.

26:45.370 --> 26:49.534
You were too honorable to say so,
because you were married.

26:49.774 --> 26:54.302
So l had to go to Paris.
You know, put an ocean between us.

26:54.479 --> 26:59.473
And no matter how many divine
Frenchmen begged me, l'd never marry.

26:59.651 --> 27:06.215
l'd just live there, all pale
and mysterious, huge tragic artist.

27:06.925 --> 27:11.658
And then one night,
l'd be in some club.

27:11.830 --> 27:16.290
A fabulous Paris gown.
l'd see you at the door.

27:16.434 --> 27:21.667
Tall, distinguished,
a little grey at the temples.

27:21.840 --> 27:26.209
l pretended your eyes would burn
into me across this room.

27:26.378 --> 27:32.317
Suddenly, there'd be a hush.
And everyone would look at me.

27:32.450 --> 27:38.320
And then l'd just stand up
and float towards you.

27:40.058 --> 27:42.856
- And then what?
- That's all.

27:45.063 --> 27:51.832
- Julie, l don't know what to say.
- l told you. l was a real spooky kid.

28:03.048 --> 28:05.744
The Bunkers must be having a party.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.627
How bonny are the banks
of the Lucinda River.

28:20.799 --> 28:23.791
l knew we'd find friends
all along the way.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.764
Neddy!

28:31.776 --> 28:35.268
Enid. This is Julie Ann Hooper,
our babysitter.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.507
l lost her for a while.
But l found her again.

28:38.683 --> 28:40.913
How fortunate for you, darling.

28:41.086 --> 28:44.283
What a lovely dress.
You look ravishing.

28:44.456 --> 28:47.619
Ned, what a treat to have you here.

28:47.792 --> 28:50.818
l see Roger's the life of the party
as usual.

28:50.995 --> 28:55.523
He started all by himself at brunch.
l guess it caught up with him.

28:55.767 --> 28:59.965
Neddy, tell me everything.
l want to know all about you.

29:00.138 --> 29:01.503
Enid.

29:02.941 --> 29:06.172
Look who's there!
Get yourself a drink.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.778
We'll have one quick one
to appease the natives.

29:10.348 --> 29:12.509
- Neddy!
- Hi, honeybunch.

29:12.684 --> 29:16.711
- To think l nearly didn't get here.
- Ned, you old fossil. How are you?

29:16.921 --> 29:18.388
Great. Just great.

29:18.556 --> 29:21.548
- Ned! My God, it's been a dog's age.
- Rusty.

29:21.726 --> 29:24.559
- Let's have a game of golf. Soon.
- Darling!

29:25.196 --> 29:30.862
- ls it undiplomatic to ask of Lucinda?
- She's great. And bring your money.

29:31.536 --> 29:35.632
- Neddy! Neddy, darling.
- l'm John.

29:35.807 --> 29:39.243
We want to see you.
Lucinda will call. How you doing?

29:39.444 --> 29:41.139
Great, great.

29:42.580 --> 29:45.208
- My God, Neddy Merrill.
- Freddy Preston.

29:45.383 --> 29:50.548
Marvelous to see you. We missed
you. l expected you'd be on Xanadu.

29:50.722 --> 29:53.088
- l'll have to call Willie.
- Good show.

29:53.324 --> 29:55.849
- Mr. Merrill.
- Hi, Stanley. How's lnez?

29:56.027 --> 29:58.894
- She'll be glad to see you.
- She's my girl.

29:59.063 --> 30:03.397
- Yes, sir. What may l get you?
- Dom Perignon. That's for us.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.092
Yes, sir.

30:06.037 --> 30:09.404
- Ever drink champagne?
- Once at a birthday party.

30:13.778 --> 30:16.838
A boy drank it out of my slipper.

30:19.417 --> 30:22.181
Here's to sugar on our strawberries.

30:38.803 --> 30:41.567
- Ned, my God.
- Brian. How are you, Brian?

30:41.739 --> 30:43.730
l feel rotten l didn't call.

30:43.908 --> 30:47.810
l've been so damn busy.
l don't know where the time goes.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.276
- Let's have lunch this week.
- Okay.

30:50.448 --> 30:54.316
l wanted to tell you.
That was a stinking thing to do.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.750
- What they pulled at your place.
- What's that?

30:57.922 --> 31:02.757
Well, now l don't care how big
a firecracker this new guy was.

31:02.927 --> 31:06.294
Well, brother,
that story really jolted me.

31:06.464 --> 31:12.061
l thought, what if a young smart-ass
comes to our shop and does that?

31:12.237 --> 31:15.604
Let's hear from you, huh?
Ring me at the office.

31:18.109 --> 31:19.838
Beautiful Cynthia.

31:20.044 --> 31:23.980
- Neddy. Darling!
- Hi, where's Carter?

31:24.148 --> 31:26.946
Well, haven't you heard?
We've separated.

31:27.118 --> 31:29.985
This is Julie Ann Hooper,
our babysitter.

31:30.154 --> 31:34.352
- Run along to your babies, dear.
- She's with me.

31:34.559 --> 31:39.792
- We're swimming across the county.
- How healthy and young of you.

31:40.765 --> 31:43.700
Now, who else could wear
a dress like this?

31:43.868 --> 31:48.328
Why don't you come over
tonight for dinner?

31:48.573 --> 31:50.131
l'd love to.

31:50.875 --> 31:53.207
lf Lucinda hasn't made a date.

31:53.378 --> 31:57.337
Lucinda! Well, congratulations.

31:59.384 --> 32:00.874
- Ned.
- Denny boy!

32:01.085 --> 32:04.213
Why not leave some phone numbers?
l've tried to reach you.

32:04.455 --> 32:06.116
l've heard of an opening.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.623
Perfect for you. Your experience.

32:08.793 --> 32:12.160
Small place,
but these two guys are creative.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.389
- Say hello to Julie Ann.
- Hello.

32:14.599 --> 32:20.834
They have a reputation for originality.
Approach them right, take a cut.

32:21.005 --> 32:22.734
Take a cut?

32:24.208 --> 32:28.167
Now, look here, Ned.
You don't have to pretend with me.

32:36.421 --> 32:39.151
Set! Go!

35:54.318 --> 35:56.582
Did you hurt yourself?

35:56.754 --> 36:00.019
lt's nothing. Bad takeoff.

36:00.191 --> 36:02.591
Let's go and sit down somewhere.

36:11.903 --> 36:14.895
- Does it hurt?
- No, it's all right.

36:15.072 --> 36:16.801
What sort of a job do you have?

36:16.974 --> 36:20.466
Secretary. We're the largest office
supply company in New York.

36:20.645 --> 36:24.411
- l've never run into you on the train.
- l take the 7:22.

36:24.582 --> 36:28.484
- l'm first in, so l make the coffee.
- A friendly office?

36:28.653 --> 36:32.145
Two girls want to get an apartment
after our raises.

36:32.356 --> 36:37.293
- Watch out, it's a big wicked city.
- l know. l've had some experiences.

36:37.461 --> 36:39.122
- Like what?
- Well...

36:39.297 --> 36:43.256
...one morning l was making coffee
and looked out the window.

36:43.434 --> 36:46.597
There's an apartment building
across the court.

36:46.771 --> 36:53.233
This man was standing in his window,
looking at me. He was stark naked.

36:53.444 --> 36:57.403
- That's terrible.
- l just stood there looking at him.

36:57.582 --> 37:00.312
You ought to report that
to somebody.

37:00.484 --> 37:04.011
He's never been there again.
l check every morning.

37:04.288 --> 37:06.620
There's a lot of nuts around.

37:06.991 --> 37:11.018
Another time, my boss sent me
to deliver some record books.

37:11.195 --> 37:16.861
l got into an elevator and pressed 26.
Then a man got in and he pressed 27.

37:17.034 --> 37:19.935
The door closed and
the elevator started up.

37:20.104 --> 37:23.767
This man came right over
and kissed me on the mouth.

37:23.941 --> 37:26.535
- What'd you do?
- l dropped the books.

37:26.711 --> 37:28.008
Then what happened?

37:28.179 --> 37:29.976
He picked them up,
gave them to me.

37:30.147 --> 37:33.844
The door opened
on the 26th floor, and l got out.

37:34.552 --> 37:38.648
Can you imagine?
A building on Park Avenue?

37:44.228 --> 37:46.958
That belly is like a heap of wheat.

37:47.131 --> 37:50.066
Fenced about with lilies.

37:52.503 --> 37:54.801
That's from the Bible, isn't it?

37:54.972 --> 37:56.837
Song of Solomon.

37:57.074 --> 38:02.171
As a little girl in Sunday school,
they never mentioned that part.

38:05.216 --> 38:08.310
You still are a little girl
in Sunday school.

38:10.354 --> 38:12.822
You know, Julie,
l've been thinking.

38:13.724 --> 38:15.715
l could...

38:16.160 --> 38:19.357
l could meet you in the morning
and take you to your office.

38:19.530 --> 38:24.024
lf you had to go out on an errand,
call me and l'd go with you.

38:24.335 --> 38:27.566
l'd pick you up every day
at noon and we'd have lunch.

38:28.773 --> 38:32.209
That's what l'll do, Julie.
l'll take care of you.

38:33.411 --> 38:36.869
Well, gee, Mr. Merrill, l...

38:37.048 --> 38:40.176
l don't think that would
work out too well.

38:40.351 --> 38:43.946
l have a boyfriend.
He's a very jealous type.

38:44.121 --> 38:46.851
lf l just look at anybody else,
he has a fit.

38:47.024 --> 38:50.585
He's a very high-strung person.
He has so many problems!

38:50.761 --> 38:52.626
What sort of problems?

38:52.797 --> 38:57.359
His mother. He says
she's a very sensuous woman.

38:57.535 --> 38:59.093
He says she has lovers.

38:59.270 --> 39:02.205
He's not even 100-percent sure
he's legitimate.

39:02.373 --> 39:05.308
He's taking it out
on the whole United States.

39:05.509 --> 39:09.240
- Where did you meet this boy?
- Through a computer.

39:09.413 --> 39:11.779
- A computer?
- Yeah, it's a joke.

39:11.949 --> 39:16.113
All the kids are doing it. You fill out
this questionnaire, send in $3...

39:16.287 --> 39:20.314
...and they send you the phone
numbers of three ideal mates.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.118
He was the first one l called.

39:24.061 --> 39:26.291
How'd you meet Mrs. Merrill?

39:26.464 --> 39:28.898
l...

39:29.266 --> 39:33.134
On a boat,
going to Europe one summer.

39:33.304 --> 39:37.968
l was with a bunch of students
down in steerage.

39:38.142 --> 39:42.135
l sneaked up to the first-class
salon, and there she was.

39:42.313 --> 39:44.907
How romantic and old-fashioned.

39:45.082 --> 39:48.245
Now, wait a minute.
lt wasn't that long ago.

39:48.419 --> 39:54.551
Well, it sounds so much more
passionate than a computer.

40:01.599 --> 40:05.296
That shirt of mine, Julie.
Do you still have it?

40:05.469 --> 40:07.460
No.

40:07.638 --> 40:10.436
Well, after a while, l...

40:10.841 --> 40:13.969
l decided it was just a shirt.

40:16.647 --> 40:22.643
You had so many shirts, l didn't
think you'd miss it or anything.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.577
Do you mind?

40:25.022 --> 40:27.456
No, but l wish...

40:28.159 --> 40:30.320
l wish you'd told me how you felt.

40:30.494 --> 40:32.462
l couldn't.

40:33.030 --> 40:35.692
l would have died.

40:35.866 --> 40:38.232
There's so little love
in the world.

40:38.402 --> 40:41.235
When it's kept a secret,
it's wasted, see?

40:45.309 --> 40:47.334
You're very precious to me.

40:48.112 --> 40:51.081
l won't let you
ever get scared or hurt.

40:51.248 --> 40:54.183
lf there's anything you want,
come to me.

40:54.685 --> 40:58.314
- l'll be your guardian angel.
- Mr. Merrill, l...

40:58.756 --> 41:00.053
Julie.

41:01.392 --> 41:04.418
Julie! Julie!

41:36.694 --> 41:38.525
Hi, Steve.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.225
- Well, you're not Steve.
- No.

41:44.401 --> 41:46.130
How are you, Mr. Merrill?

41:46.303 --> 41:48.464
- l'm a friend of the Hallorans.
- l know.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.936
- Mind if l ride up with you?
- Not at all.

41:51.108 --> 41:52.769
Don't bother.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.114
Thank you.

42:07.458 --> 42:10.621
How long you been driving
for the Hallorans?

42:10.794 --> 42:13.456
Going on a couple of years now.

42:15.399 --> 42:20.598
- What happened to Steve?
- l'm afraid l don't know.

42:23.107 --> 42:27.134
Man, what a character.
Did he mangle the English language!

42:27.311 --> 42:30.246
We told him he should be
on television.

42:33.350 --> 42:37.309
Big bass voice,
you should've heard that guy sing.

42:37.922 --> 42:41.358
- And a natural sense of rhythm?
- Yeah, that's right.

42:48.499 --> 42:51.957
- l'll take them the paper.
- Thank you.

42:52.136 --> 42:53.865
Thank you for the lift.

42:54.038 --> 42:57.474
And my apologies. l don't know
why l thought you were Steve.

42:57.641 --> 42:59.609
That's okay.

43:18.896 --> 43:21.558
Hello? Oh, hello, honey.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.063
Tell her to hurry.
They'll miss the sun.

43:25.703 --> 43:29.662
She refuses to bring the children
unless we put on our suits.

43:30.007 --> 43:33.465
After the way we raised her?
What's the matter with her?

43:33.644 --> 43:38.479
After the way we raised you?
What's the matter with you, honey?

43:38.816 --> 43:42.411
She says they're her children,
and she'll raise them her way.

43:42.586 --> 43:47.580
- They'll end up repressed.
- Mummy says they'll end up repressed.

43:52.062 --> 43:54.394
She's not going to bring the children.

43:57.668 --> 44:01.661
Good heavens! lt's Neddy Merrill.

44:04.842 --> 44:09.404
- l wonder if he's come to ask us again.
- He'll get the same answer.

44:09.580 --> 44:14.108
- Oh, dear. lt seems a little mean.
- He's not going to get a penny.

44:14.318 --> 44:16.183
Couldn't we help him a little?

44:16.353 --> 44:18.913
For old times' sake?
After all, he's a friend.

44:19.089 --> 44:21.523
Friends are not deductible.

44:21.692 --> 44:23.956
- Hello, Neddy dear!
- How are you, my boy?

44:24.128 --> 44:27.962
- l'm swimming across the county.
- l didn't know one could.

44:28.132 --> 44:32.364
- l met your new chauffeur.
- Nice boy. Sense of personal worth.

44:32.536 --> 44:37.803
- l got a lot of laughs out of Steve.
- Steve had no sense of personal worth.

44:37.975 --> 44:39.101
What does it say?

44:39.276 --> 44:42.939
"At the zoning board meeting,
local property owners objected...

44:43.113 --> 44:47.379
...to the Halloran proposal on the basis
it would overcrowd public schools."

44:47.551 --> 44:52.079
We petitioned to cut the Driscoll estate
into two-acre lots, instead of five.

44:52.256 --> 44:54.747
They're practically
calling us communists.

44:54.925 --> 44:59.794
- Sticks and stones, sticks and stones.
- lt'll be a tough fight, Chester.

44:59.963 --> 45:04.593
- Why is that tree bare?
- Oh, that's an ash.

45:04.935 --> 45:06.562
Well, it must be blighted.

45:06.770 --> 45:11.730
No. Ashes are the last to get their
leaves and the first to lose them.

45:12.009 --> 45:14.978
Overcrowding
the public schools, indeed.

45:15.145 --> 45:19.741
As though people with two acres
propagate more than people with five.

45:19.917 --> 45:22.511
That's not even a biological fact.

45:22.686 --> 45:27.680
- Safari Ball. Put me down for a table.
- Oh, Neddy.

45:27.991 --> 45:32.052
What's the matter?
Don't l always support your benefits?

45:32.229 --> 45:37.292
- A table costs $ 1000.
- Okay, put me down.

45:48.879 --> 45:54.215
By the way, my boy, l was awfully
sorry that we couldn't be of help.

45:54.384 --> 45:56.944
l don't recall asking you for help.

45:57.121 --> 45:59.555
How are Lucinda and the girls?

45:59.723 --> 46:03.454
Lucinda's fine and the girls are
home playing tennis.

46:06.330 --> 46:09.629
Now, if you don't mind,
l think l'll get wet.

46:15.272 --> 46:20.471
- Didn't ask for any money after all.
- Just wait.

46:31.588 --> 46:33.988
He must be back on his feet.

46:36.193 --> 46:38.821
He bought a whole table, didn't he?

47:08.292 --> 47:10.954
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:11.128 --> 47:16.327
- l bet your name's Gilmartin.
- Kevin Gilmartin Jr., after my father.

47:16.500 --> 47:20.027
My mother says l've got
a lot to live down.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.639
How about giving me a cup?

47:22.806 --> 47:26.298
- lt's 10 cents.
- l'll owe it to you.

47:26.476 --> 47:31.072
- How do l know l'll collect?
- l'll drop around tomorrow and pay you.

47:31.248 --> 47:35.241
Scout's honor.
Well, l look honest, don't l?

47:39.056 --> 47:40.921
Thanks.

47:45.162 --> 47:46.925
You're shivering.

47:47.130 --> 47:48.893
ls your mother home?

47:49.066 --> 47:54.060
She's in Europe. lt's a honeymoon,
so she couldn't take me.

47:54.238 --> 47:57.765
- How's your father?
- He's in love with a manicurist.

47:57.941 --> 48:03.174
That's what Mother says. l have to
depend on her for information.

48:09.152 --> 48:12.019
- You alone here?
- There's a maid.

48:12.189 --> 48:17.593
l'm gonna invite you over to our house.
l've got two girls you can play with.

48:17.761 --> 48:20.286
- How big?
- Not much bigger than you.

48:20.464 --> 48:22.364
- Do you play with them?
- Sure.

48:22.532 --> 48:25.467
We play tennis
and we go bike riding together.

48:25.669 --> 48:30.606
- l have an English racing bike.
- Fine, bring it over. We'll race you.

48:31.541 --> 48:33.975
- Do you want another?
- No, thanks.

48:34.177 --> 48:35.735
You'll owe me 20 cents.

48:35.913 --> 48:39.610
l haven't time.
l'm swimming home.

48:40.050 --> 48:45.078
- Do you mind if l use your pool?
- Not at all, but...

49:30.467 --> 49:34.426
Well, that does it.
That really does it.

49:41.244 --> 49:43.109
My whole project is ruined.

49:43.280 --> 49:46.477
They emptied the pool
because l'm not a good swimmer.

49:46.650 --> 49:50.711
l'm bad at sports. At school,
nobody wants me on their team.

49:50.887 --> 49:53.720
lt's a lot better that way.
You take it from me.

49:53.890 --> 49:57.849
At first, it's the end of the world
because you're not on the team.

49:58.028 --> 50:00.394
- Till you realize.
- Realize what?

50:00.764 --> 50:04.165
You realize that you're free.
You're your own man.

50:04.334 --> 50:08.293
No need to worry about being captain
and all that status stuff.

50:08.472 --> 50:12.374
They'd never elect me captain
in a million years.

50:12.542 --> 50:17.309
You're the captain of your soul.
That's what counts. Know what l mean?

50:19.116 --> 50:21.175
There's one thing l could do.

50:21.351 --> 50:25.515
l could get in and make believe
l'm swimming across the pool.

50:25.689 --> 50:27.782
But that's kind of cheating, isn't it?

50:27.958 --> 50:31.394
Not if l did all the strokes exactly
as if l were in the water.

50:31.561 --> 50:34.689
- Hey, that's a good idea!
- Let's do it.

50:38.568 --> 50:41.002
Now, there are three things
to remember:

50:41.171 --> 50:43.196
Relax...

50:43.907 --> 50:48.071
...reach and follow through.
That's it.

50:48.278 --> 50:50.906
Okay, let's start with the crawl.

50:56.553 --> 50:59.522
Hey, you got pretty good form.

51:00.090 --> 51:05.027
l've had lots of lessons.
lt's just that l'm afraid of the water.

51:05.195 --> 51:10.064
Okay, over on your back. That's it.

51:10.233 --> 51:12.667
You know what we do
in the winter?

51:12.836 --> 51:15.600
We flood our tennis courts
and ice-skate on them.

51:15.806 --> 51:21.403
Those kids of mine look so damn cute.
Like elves in their red stocking caps.

51:21.578 --> 51:25.378
- l don't know how to skate.
- You come over, we'll teach you.

51:25.549 --> 51:28.814
- Then we'll have a game of hockey.
- Okay.

51:29.252 --> 51:34.588
Breaststroke. Yes, sir, those kids
of mine think l got all the answers.

51:34.758 --> 51:38.353
Those kids of mine
think l'm just about it.

51:43.700 --> 51:48.069
l've done it! lt's the first time
l've ever swum a whole lane!

51:48.238 --> 51:50.263
Congratulations.

51:57.380 --> 52:00.872
l suppose it doesn't count, though,
because there's no water.

52:01.051 --> 52:04.214
- For us there was.
- But that's a lie, isn't it?

52:04.387 --> 52:09.450
No. You see, if you make believe
hard enough that something is true...

52:09.626 --> 52:11.594
...then it is true for you.

52:11.761 --> 52:15.754
- Let's do it again.
- l gotta be going.

52:16.600 --> 52:20.434
- Oh, come on, please?
- lt's getting late.

52:20.971 --> 52:25.999
- l'm sorry, l'd like to, but...
- lf you're gonna leave, then leave.

52:28.945 --> 52:33.882
l'll give you a ring tomorrow.
About coming over.

53:04.314 --> 53:07.408
- What's the matter?
- l thought you were gonna dive.

53:07.617 --> 53:12.316
You thought l was gonna dive?
There's no water in the pool.

53:12.489 --> 53:15.424
Well, so long again.

54:28.098 --> 54:31.261
Ain't it a bitch, huh?
You ever seen anything like it?

54:31.434 --> 54:36.394
Fifteen tons, 30,000 pounds of
structured aluminum and clear plastic.

54:58.395 --> 55:02.491
So there we are, bare-assed,
and we jump in the pool.

55:02.666 --> 55:07.968
lt's all steamy and warm, and the
snowflakes are floating down...

55:08.138 --> 55:13.303
...and the hi-fi system is playing
and Grace and l are on our backs...

55:13.476 --> 55:17.310
...just bobbing along
and l says to Grace:

55:17.480 --> 55:21.644
Well, this party has everything,
including a gatecrasher.

55:22.552 --> 55:25.077
l was hoping
you'd be glad to see me.

55:25.255 --> 55:28.986
You never came when l invited you.
Why should l be glad now?

55:29.159 --> 55:34.495
- Well, l thought, better late than never.
- You thought wrong, buster.

55:34.664 --> 55:38.498
As one of your more
distinguished gatecrashers...

55:38.668 --> 55:40.465
...do l rate a drink?

55:40.637 --> 55:42.434
Suit yourself.

55:54.884 --> 55:58.376
- You're new around here, aren't you?
- What do you mean, new?

55:58.588 --> 56:03.355
- lt's just l haven't seen you at parties.
- l haven't seen you neither.

56:04.127 --> 56:09.121
l'll have a gin on the rocks, please.
When you have a chance.

56:11.134 --> 56:14.900
Here l am again, Leroy.
Fill 'er up.

56:15.805 --> 56:18.239
Some big deal, huh?

56:18.808 --> 56:23.507
Boy, you sure gotta like swimming
to go in for this expenditure.

56:24.381 --> 56:28.044
You look like the type
that goes in for swimming, huh?

56:28.218 --> 56:32.314
Why not? When the world is
so generously supplied with water.

56:32.489 --> 56:36.858
l'm not a maniac about it. Tell you
the truth, it's murder on my hair.

56:37.026 --> 56:38.994
Lovely hair.

56:41.131 --> 56:43.065
Thank you.

56:44.234 --> 56:48.330
You a neighbor from around here?

56:50.039 --> 56:51.939
No.

56:52.142 --> 56:55.043
You a friend of the Biswangers?

56:55.845 --> 56:59.406
They're not even
on our Christmas card list.

57:00.784 --> 57:02.911
Then what are you?

57:04.754 --> 57:06.881
l'm an explorer.

57:07.056 --> 57:12.517
- No, l mean, what are you doing here?
- l'm swimming home.

57:17.600 --> 57:19.227
You married?

57:19.402 --> 57:23.862
- What's that got to do with it?
- You're divorced? What?

57:26.676 --> 57:28.974
Do you want to come with me?

57:29.179 --> 57:34.207
- Where?
- Along a river of sapphire pools.

57:35.685 --> 57:40.088
- l never heard anyone talk like you.
- Come with me, be my love.

57:40.256 --> 57:42.816
- That l've heard before.
- Not from me.

57:42.992 --> 57:46.689
- You're no different than any other guy.
- But l am.

57:46.830 --> 57:51.893
l'm a very special human being.
Noble and splendid.

57:54.437 --> 57:56.928
Come on, Joan.

58:46.022 --> 58:47.785
Hey, wait a minute.

58:48.858 --> 58:51.190
This looks like my wagon.

58:54.130 --> 58:57.065
l'm sure this is my wagon.

59:00.370 --> 59:02.304
This is my wagon.

59:02.472 --> 59:05.032
l wheel my kids around in it.
You see that?

59:05.208 --> 59:09.645
That's where Ella put her foot through,
and l mended it with plywood.

59:09.812 --> 59:12.781
This is my wagon, man.

59:13.016 --> 59:16.213
- What's the trouble here?
- This is my hot dog wagon.

59:16.386 --> 59:18.547
- We bought it.
- You bought it?

59:18.721 --> 59:22.213
- At a white elephant sale.
- What the hell was it doing there?

59:22.392 --> 59:25.657
- Your wife must have donated it.
- She had no right.

59:25.828 --> 59:29.320
- She knows l'm crazy about this thing.
- Take it up with her.

59:29.499 --> 59:31.865
- l'll buy it back from you.
- Not interested.

59:32.035 --> 59:35.436
l'll give you twice what you paid for it.
l'll give you $ 100.

59:35.605 --> 59:38.335
A hundred dollars?
For that piece of junk?

59:38.508 --> 59:42.274
l wanna buy this wagon back.
Name a price, l'll send you a check.

59:42.445 --> 59:45.073
He'll send me a check.

59:45.415 --> 59:48.680
- l'm taking this thing home with me.
- Hands off, you.

59:48.851 --> 59:52.582
You crashed in,
now crash the hell out.

59:53.122 --> 59:54.453
Go on, beat it!

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:09.263
l'll have my lawyers
get in touch with you.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:10.770
Yeah, you do that.

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:50.498
What are you doing here?

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:54.131
- What a great suit. New?
- Last year's.

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:58.144
- l don't remember that suit.
- You weren't around last year.

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.544
God, you look sensational.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:05.718
- What the hell are you doing here?
- l'm swimming home.

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:09.016
- You're what?
- Pool by pool, across the county.

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:11.888
Good Christ, Ned,
will you ever grow up?

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:15.521
- Let me try.
- No.

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:18.832
Please, let me.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.498
When l was a Boy Scout,
l passed the first-aid test...

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:30.908
...but there wasn't much
in it about splinters.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:35.847
Now, if you broke something,
l could make you a beautiful splint.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.683
l'm sorry.

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:51.291
There we are.
A regular redwood.

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.993
Cut a hole in it,
you could drive a car through.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:05.312
- What did you do that for?
- Keep away from me, will you, please?

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:10.111
You must be crazy.
Everybody's gone crazy today.

01:03:10.286 --> 01:03:15.383
l just came from the Biswangers'.
They snubbed me.

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:18.083
Everybody at their party
snubbed me.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.723
They've even got my hot dog wagon.

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:24.397
Your wagon?

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:27.832
l painted it myself
and put the little umbrella up.

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:31.006
l always kept it in the playroom,
remember?

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:34.109
l've never been to your house,
remember?

01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:40.009
God, l'm tired.
You mind if l have a drink?

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:42.174
All right.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:50.990
- How about you, you want a bullshot?
- No, thank you.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.354
Oh, come on, now.
You love the way l make them.

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:01.968
We are running out of Tabasco.

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:04.796
"We"?

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:09.005
Aren't you a little confused
this afternoon?

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:16.778
- How goes it in Never Never Land?
- What?

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:21.287
Has the ideal all-American family
found happiness on the hill?

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:22.481
The hill?

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:26.321
l heard a rumor that you'd
changed your place of residence.

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.963
Of course not, that's ridiculous.

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:33.499
Well, how is the president
of the League of Women Voters?

01:04:33.669 --> 01:04:35.500
- Who?
- How is your wife?

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:37.969
Oh, she's fine.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.337
l've been away so long
l haven't kept up with the news.

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:46.140
l suppose by now all waitresses in
town must be certified nonvenereal.

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:49.648
Last l heard that was
your wife's latest project:

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:53.755
Physical checkups
for food handlers.

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:57.588
Lucinda's always done
a lot of good in this town.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:01.628
She just didn't do
so good at home, did she?

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:17.339
Here's to sugar on our strawberries.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.644
Cheers.

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:32.289
Remember last winter in Toronto?

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:35.259
We called room service
and ordered bullshots.

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:38.161
l wasn't in Toronto last winter.

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:44.604
l came up for the opening of your show.
Remember how it snowed?

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:49.234
l ordered a horse and sleigh to take
us from the hotel to the theatre.

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:52.973
l haven't been in Toronto
in three years now.

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:58.714
Was it Boston? What was
the name of that play in Boston?

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:02.380
l came up on a Saturday, remember?
You faked a slipped disk.

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:06.995
Your standby went on for the matinee.
l cured your aching back, didn't l?

01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:09.130
You bastard.

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:15.297
Listen, Ned, l want you to get out
of here now, l mean it!

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.937
- Why?
- l'm expecting someone.

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:23.074
- Who?
- None of your business who.

01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:28.576
A man?

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:32.414
Do you think l've been in a deep
freeze while you've played house?

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:34.453
Yes, a man.

01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:47.764
l'm cold.

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:54.342
What's the matter with that sun?
There's no heat in it.

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.548
Shirley...

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:08.047
...what happened?

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:11.453
What happened to what?

01:07:13.062 --> 01:07:15.462
Nothing's turned out...

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:21.201
Nothing's turned out
the way l thought it would.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:27.138
When l was a kid,
l used to believe in things.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.178
People seemed happier
when l was a kid.

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:32.871
People used to love each other.
What happened?

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:37.884
You got tossed out of your golden
playpen, that's what happened.

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:45.585
My mother gave me 25 cents for
mowing the lawn around our house.

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:49.697
Seems only a minute ago...

01:07:49.865 --> 01:07:52.595
...l could smell the grass.

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:57.100
lt's so fast.

01:07:58.307 --> 01:08:01.208
People grow up and then they...

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:05.908
We're all gonna die, Shirley.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:09.245
That doesn't make
much sense, does it?

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.580
Sometimes it does.

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:18.323
Sometimes at 3:00 in the morning.

01:08:18.727 --> 01:08:22.595
Did you know l went to spy on you
once in the lobby of the theatre?

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:26.758
- Spy on me?
- lt was a long time ago.

01:08:27.336 --> 01:08:30.362
You were meeting your family
to take them to the ballet.

01:08:30.538 --> 01:08:34.600
l saw your daughters in their white
gloves and patent leather slippers...

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:38.073
...and that aging Vassar-girl
wife of yours...

01:08:38.247 --> 01:08:41.080
...and her understated little suit.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.616
And you...

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:50.419
There you were, shaking hands
with people, smiling, saying hello.

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:54.586
One hour before that,
you'd been in bed with me.

01:08:55.564 --> 01:09:00.729
l put that smile on your face,
you damned hypocrite!

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:02.962
l want you to get out of here now.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:07.872
Swim the pool, do whatever
you have to do, but get out.

01:09:12.413 --> 01:09:15.076
As soon as you tell me
who's coming over.

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:17.685
l told you that's
none of your business.

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:22.187
On a 10-point scale,
how would you rate him in bed?

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:38.304
What did l do to you, Shirley?
l'm sorry for whatever l did.

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:40.805
The usual red-blooded
married man thing.

01:09:40.975 --> 01:09:45.310
At lunch, you lectured me about
the duties of a father and a husband.

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:49.542
lt's a classic by now, reprinted
yearly in the Reader's Digest.

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:51.049
l don't remember.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.680
lt's the first really chic restaurant
you took me to in New York.

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:58.986
Right out in front
of everyone who counts.

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:02.324
- You cried.
- l also raised my voice.

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:04.989
lt tore me apart to see you crying.

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:08.864
You chose that place because you
thought l wouldn't make a fuss...

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:14.408
...in front of all those mink hats and
snobbish waiters and stylish fags.

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:15.805
No, no.

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:18.572
Did you really think
you could get rid of me...

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:22.649
...in no more noise than
the sound of finger bowls tinkling?

01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:24.308
l loved you.

01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:26.977
l didn't know what to do.

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:31.756
So you went back to your wife whom
you didn't love. Well, it figures.

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:34.828
lt's her real estate,
she owns all the pots and pans...

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:37.727
...knows where all
the lost shirt buttons are.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:43.668
Why give up those comforts? Well,
l had a few comforts of my own.

01:10:43.839 --> 01:10:47.002
When you were on that train
back to Connecticut...

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:50.236
...remember that groovy bellhop
in my hotel?

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:53.848
- Absolutely primitive, no hang-ups.
- You're lying.

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:56.211
You called me from the station.

01:10:56.385 --> 01:11:00.014
l put the phone on the pillow
between us so we both could listen.

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:03.625
All that sniveling about
your innocent wife and children.

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:06.784
We laughed so hard,
we stuffed the sheets in our mouths.

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:08.987
You're lying.

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:12.799
You'll never know, will you?

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:32.084
Let me do your back.

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:37.651
- No.
- Please let me.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:56.339
Shirley, let's go away
for a couple of weeks.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:12:00.445
l read about a great old castle
in lreland.

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:04.450
A real one,
with a moat and a drawbridge.

01:12:06.822 --> 01:12:11.088
Some king built it,
hundreds of years ago.

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:15.457
lt's an inn now
with crazy old four-posters...

01:12:15.964 --> 01:12:19.365
...and big soft beds with canopies.

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:23.200
Ned, l want you to go away now.

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:29.605
Will you come with me, Shirley?

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:36.178
Do you really think it's that easy?

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:42.385
Of course everything's always
been easy for you, hasn't it?

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:47.288
You could always get
a cab in the rain...

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:50.091
...a woman into bed.

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:55.064
God knows l was
easy enough to get.

01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:57.501
You wore a blue slip...

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:01.803
...with a safety pin holding up
your shoulder strap.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:06.208
l thought we were
going to make it.

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:09.544
l really thought
we were going to make it.

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:12.414
l kissed that safety pin.

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:16.257
Ned, please don't.

01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:30.027
Shirley.

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:43.380
l never meant to hurt you, Shirley.

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:50.691
Please believe me.
Please.

01:14:12.781 --> 01:14:15.545
What's the matter with you?

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:20.751
l'll get you a sweater.

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:22.788
No.

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:29.094
- You must be catching something.
- How can l swim in a sweater?

01:14:29.264 --> 01:14:32.324
- Listen, l'll drive you home.
- No.

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.801
l've got to swim home.

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:44.208
- For the love of God, why?
- l've just got to. l've got to.

01:14:46.448 --> 01:14:49.178
- l'll go get the car.
- No!

01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:52.013
l can't go in a car.
lt's impossible.

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:54.246
How can l?

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:59.724
Lucinda's waiting.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:03.620
The girls are home playing tennis.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:06.600
l'm swimming home.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.263
My God...

01:15:37.132 --> 01:15:40.898
Come with me.
Come with me, Shirley.

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:44.900
- Ned, l can't.
- Please. Come with me.

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:47.473
- Please don't.
- Shirley.

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:51.204
- Leave me alone.
- You know you don't want me to.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.213
Please leave me alone.

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:59.983
We made love together in this pool.
And you loved it, remember?

01:16:00.656 --> 01:16:05.355
- l lied.
- You loved it, Shirley. You loved it.

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:08.255
- Ned, don't.
- Please.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:10.193
- Baby.
- No, Ned.

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:12.492
- Please.
- Ned, no, don't.

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:18.231
No, stop it, Ned.
Don't. Ned, don't. No.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:20.375
Damn you! No!

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:24.770
l lied! l lied all the time
about loving it anywhere with you!

01:16:24.947 --> 01:16:28.906
You bored me to tears with all
your stories about your old deals...

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:32.110
...your old girls, your golf scores,
your bloody war...

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:35.757
...your bloody duty, wife and kids.
You bored me to tears.

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:38.552
- l was playing a scene with you.
- You loved me.

01:16:38.727 --> 01:16:42.686
You met your match in me,
you suburban stud. l was acting!

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.440
You loved it.

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:02.448
You loved it.

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:05.280
We both loved it.

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:08.383
You loved it!

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:17.175
Just one lane.
l wanna swim just one lane.

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:21.076
- You don't understand.
- l understand you ain't got 50 cents.

01:20:21.249 --> 01:20:25.618
Can't you make an exception? My
house is right over there on the hill.

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:29.188
- l'll come back with the money.
- Get the hell out, mister.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.858
Listen...

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:42.670
...will you lend me 50 cents?

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:46.638
- Please. Please.
- Why the hell should l?

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:50.505
l'll pay you back.
Don't you realize l'll pay you back?

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:53.113
Beat it.

01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:54.976
- Howie!
- Mr. Merrill.

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:57.277
- Lend me 50 cents.
- Don't do it.

01:20:57.452 --> 01:20:59.716
Howie, for chrissake.

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:04.283
What's 50 cents?
l mean, considering.

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:06.484
Thanks, Howie.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:10.457
Thanks a lot.
Thanks an awful lot.

01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:15.296
Hold it.

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:16.994
Can't you read, buddy?

01:21:19.541 --> 01:21:22.032
Take a shower.

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:44.057
Go on back and wash those feet.

01:22:32.747 --> 01:22:35.580
Spread your toes.

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:45.616
Bottoms.

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:50.593
Okay.

01:24:28.696 --> 01:24:32.063
- Your friends' pools run out of water?
- What?

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:35.361
How do you like our water, Mr. Merrill?

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:39.803
Hi, Jack.
You sure got a lot of chlorine in it.

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:41.702
Stings your eyes?

01:24:42.010 --> 01:24:45.537
- Yeah, that's too bad.
- Ain't seen you in a while.

01:24:45.713 --> 01:24:49.615
- Too bad you don't get into town.
- We sure had good times.

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:55.414
l used to see you four or five times a
week. A few drinks, a hamburger.

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:57.089
How is the series?

01:24:57.258 --> 01:25:00.591
- What are you waiting for? Ask him.
- What series?

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:03.026
- The World Series.
- Two years ago.

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:07.100
- Did you use the seats l gave you?
- They were great seats.

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:09.429
- Are you gonna ask him?
- Shut up.

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:12.630
l'll ask him. When you
gonna pay your bill?

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:16.077
We're decent people,
trying to make a living.

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:17.734
We got bills too.

01:25:17.912 --> 01:25:21.541
You're the first deadbeat
we ever got in our place.

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:23.376
Hold it down, Lil.

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:25.041
Now, wait a minute.

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:30.089
Listen, l'm gonna send the both
of you a check tomorrow.

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:32.952
Yeah, that's a laugh all right.

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:37.121
He's no friend of yours.
The check isn't worth anything.

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:41.428
- Okay, that's enough.
- You should see the orders l sent up.

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:46.802
His wife wanted French strawberry
jam. American ain't good enough.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:50.672
Mrs. Merrill had to have
Dijon mustard.

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:56.181
Hearts of palm, hearts of artichokes.
Some rich diet you have up there.

01:25:56.384 --> 01:25:59.012
Hearts of Jack Finney
is what they get.

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:01.951
Let's break it up.
Let's not have a fuss.

01:26:02.123 --> 01:26:06.492
l gotta go.
How's the family, Howie?

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:10.461
My boy won the American Legion
Scholarship Award.

01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:12.327
- Straight A's.
- Wonderful.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:16.960
Our kids behave themselves,
not run around drunk, wrecking cars.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:19.800
He kept his daughters' names
out of the paper.

01:26:19.974 --> 01:26:22.101
l bet that check didn't bounce.

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:25.474
- Leave my daughters alone.
- Then teach them manners.

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:28.505
- They never listened to him.
- Shut up.

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:34.622
l'm not blaming the girls. lt's him.
Always trying to be "one of the gang."

01:26:34.789 --> 01:26:37.349
My daughters worship me.

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:40.150
They love me and respect me...

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:44.865
...because l'm their father,
and they respect me.

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:47.334
- They respect me.
- Yeah?

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:48.729
My girls love me.

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:53.636
We heard those girls talking in
our place, giving you the raspberry.

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:55.173
You're a liar.

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:57.901
Come on,
don't talk to my wife that way.

01:26:58.079 --> 01:26:59.944
She's a goddamned liar.

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:05.142
Wanna know what your girls thought
of you? Your girls laughed at you.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:10.087
l heard them. They thought
you were a great big joke.
