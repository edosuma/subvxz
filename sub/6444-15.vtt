00:42.435 --> 00:44.805
Victor, can you hear me?

00:46.895 --> 00:49.395
I'm sorry for what we did to you.

00:58.075 --> 01:00.445
This was all I could save.

01:06.285 --> 01:07.665
Thank you.

01:15.795 --> 01:17.215
They're coming.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.215
You have to go.

01:20.015 --> 01:21.675
Now!

01:22.635 --> 01:25.725
Stop him! Aim for the shoulder!

01:28.315 --> 01:29.775
Seal the building.

01:29.895 --> 01:31.935
I need him alive.

02:29.535 --> 02:31.915
Sweep the area.

02:34.915 --> 02:37.375
I want him back in his cage.

04:07.490 --> 04:10.360
I hit you at 30 miles an hour.
You should be dead.

04:10.490 --> 04:12.740
Won't be the first time.

04:13.330 --> 04:15.990
- Who are you?
- Nobody you want to know.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.000
Trust me.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.000
- At least tell me how you...
- I'm sorry about your "car..."

04:21.120 --> 04:22.840
but I don't have time right now.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.750
I'm out of here.

04:31.010 --> 04:33.720
Clark, I need your help.

05:29.820 --> 05:32.150
Lana, are you okay?

05:32.280 --> 05:34.570
Yeah, it's just a cut.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.530
How'd you get here so fast?

05:37.660 --> 05:40.370
I was at the <i>Daily Planet</i> with Chloe.
What happened?

05:40.540 --> 05:42.790
I was driving down the street
to the library...

05:42.920 --> 05:45.460
when this guy ran out
in front of my car.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.500
I didn't even have time to brake.

05:49.340 --> 05:52.720
Clark, I hit him full-on.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.100
- I'm sorry.
- No, you don't understand.

05:57.220 --> 05:59.390
He didn't have a scratch on him.

06:00.770 --> 06:01.980
Lana, who is this guy?

06:02.100 --> 06:05.190
I don't know. He brought me here.
He wouldn't tell me his name.

06:05.350 --> 06:08.020
He was acting all jumpy
like somebody was after him.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.070
What does he look like?

06:28.790 --> 06:32.800
- Is that who's chasing you, the police?
- You got the wrong guy.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.840
My girlfriend didn't crash into you?

06:35.970 --> 06:38.220
- What are you looking for?
- Just some answers.

06:38.350 --> 06:40.930
You're not even hurt.
How'd you manage that?

06:41.100 --> 06:42.600
Milk, does a body good.

06:43.480 --> 06:47.060
Victor? Victor Stone?

06:47.230 --> 06:50.360
- Met High wide receiver.
- I know you?

06:51.360 --> 06:53.820
I'm Clark Kent,
I played for the Smallville Crows.

06:54.820 --> 06:59.490
Kent. Quarterback, I remember.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.200
Some arm you got.

07:01.870 --> 07:03.620
I don't play anymore.

07:05.460 --> 07:07.170
Yeah, me neither.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.960
That's not surprising,
since I heard you were dead.

07:14.630 --> 07:18.050
Look, I'm sorry about what happened
with your girlfriend. I really am.

07:18.180 --> 07:21.810
But I got places I don't wanna be
right now. Catch you later, Kent.

07:21.930 --> 07:23.970
- Victor, wait...
- Let me go!

07:25.890 --> 07:28.060
Kent! Kent, are you...?

07:33.070 --> 07:37.740
- What the hell are you made of?
- I was just about to ask you that.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.240
What are you looking at, man?

07:50.080 --> 07:53.300
Hello. Who are you?

07:53.420 --> 07:55.170
How did...?

07:56.970 --> 08:01.140
No, I understand, but I don't think
I can raise that much.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.720
All right, I'll be there.

08:08.770 --> 08:10.190
Lionel.

08:10.350 --> 08:12.860
I'm not too early, am I?
Didn't we say 11:30?

08:13.860 --> 08:17.650
Oh, right, the conference in Topeka.

08:18.740 --> 08:20.610
Come in.

08:25.160 --> 08:29.620
You'll save a full day
if you take the helicopter, senator.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.500
But if you think it could be
a conflict of interest...

08:34.630 --> 08:36.510
to accept a favor from LuthorCorp...

08:36.669 --> 08:39.630
No, no, no.
It's just that something's come "up..."

08:39.799 --> 08:41.720
and I'm going to
have to reschedule.

08:50.190 --> 08:52.440
What is it, Martha?

08:53.440 --> 08:54.860
Is everything all right?

08:55.980 --> 08:57.530
Nothing I can't handle.

08:57.650 --> 09:01.110
Oh, I don't doubt that for a minute.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.160
If you need a ride in the future...

09:11.290 --> 09:17.420
or anything, anything at all,
please don't hesitate.

09:18.380 --> 09:21.590
Please, call me.

09:23.390 --> 09:26.300
I will. Thank you.

09:46.410 --> 09:47.780
Lana, hi.

09:47.910 --> 09:49.950
Look, I'm sorry I had to
leave so soon...

09:50.080 --> 09:52.410
but Victor really didn't wanna
hang around.

09:52.540 --> 09:56.080
No, you should stay in Metropolis
so I can figure out what's going on.

09:56.210 --> 09:58.670
Yeah, Chloe's on her way
to pick you up.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.800
Okay, bye.

10:04.890 --> 10:07.640
Newspaper's got it wrong, huh?

10:08.100 --> 10:10.680
No. They didn't.

10:13.440 --> 10:19.610
We were all in the car laughing,
carrying on...

10:21.360 --> 10:23.860
then it started to snow.

10:25.780 --> 10:28.700
My little sister always loved the snow.

10:29.950 --> 10:34.830
My ma, my pops...

10:36.540 --> 10:38.880
my little sister.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.840
I should have died with them.

10:47.260 --> 10:49.680
I passed out.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.810
Expected to see some angels
next time I woke up.

10:55.600 --> 10:59.480
Instead I got a bunch of Cyntechnics
scientists playing Frankenstein.

11:00.730 --> 11:02.940
Cyntechnics, they did this to you?

11:06.660 --> 11:09.700
I wasn't the only dead guy
they pulled from an accident...

11:09.820 --> 11:13.080
just the first to survive
their experiments.

11:13.500 --> 11:16.750
If it wasn't for this one doctor
that helped me escape...

11:16.870 --> 11:19.170
I'd be more machine than man
right now.

11:20.130 --> 11:22.000
Machine?

11:23.420 --> 11:25.220
You mean bionics?

11:25.340 --> 11:28.180
That's what all the metal is
in your body.

11:30.350 --> 11:31.930
How do you know what's in me?

11:32.510 --> 11:35.890
What about that wall I tossed you into?
How come you're not even hurt?

11:36.060 --> 11:38.600
You're not the only one
who drinks a lot of milk.

11:39.940 --> 11:44.190
- So you bionic like me?
- No.

11:45.570 --> 11:46.950
I'm just different.

11:52.910 --> 11:57.160
What about your girlfriend, Lana?
She's okay with you "being..."

11:58.370 --> 12:00.460
whatever you are?

12:01.880 --> 12:04.250
Lana doesn't know.

12:07.470 --> 12:08.930
Neither will Katherine.

12:10.050 --> 12:11.680
Who's Katherine?

12:15.020 --> 12:17.140
That's my girl.

12:27.490 --> 12:29.110
She's beautiful.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.280
We were planning on getting married
after school.

12:34.580 --> 12:36.540
Some wedding that would be now.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.710
- She even know you're alive?
- No.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.920
I want to see her.

12:48.760 --> 12:53.640
If she knew what I am now,
what they did to me...

12:56.140 --> 12:58.850
How could she ever love
a thing like me?

13:01.230 --> 13:04.480
I'm really not the best person
to be asking about that.

13:14.530 --> 13:18.240
It won't even matter if Cyntechnics
catches up with me first.

13:18.370 --> 13:20.540
I got a friend who works
at the "Daily Planet."

13:20.660 --> 13:22.830
Might be able to find out
about these guys...

13:22.960 --> 13:25.040
maybe get them off your back.

13:27.630 --> 13:29.550
You'd do that for me?

13:31.260 --> 13:34.840
I kind of got this thing
about being experimented on in labs.

13:38.180 --> 13:40.680
Sit tight, you should be safe here.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.230
I'll be back as soon as I can.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.910
So on a scale from one to Taye Diggs,
where exactly are we?

13:55.030 --> 13:57.330
- He's definitely up there.
- Yeah?

13:57.450 --> 14:00.450
Tall, dark and bionic,
you think he likes blonds?

14:00.580 --> 14:03.710
His girlfriend's a brunette. Sorry.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.580
Does she know what happened to him?

14:07.590 --> 14:09.420
No. He doesn't want her to know.

14:09.550 --> 14:12.420
- He's afraid how she'll react.
- Well, what's he gonna "do..."

14:12.550 --> 14:16.260
keep lying to her and hope that
she doesn't notice how different he is?

14:18.930 --> 14:22.140
I did some digging in Cyntechnics'
backyard, and I came up with...

14:22.270 --> 14:25.400
- more flowers than dirt.
- There's gotta be something.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.190
Well, their main focus has become
the Machina Project.

14:28.310 --> 14:32.490
It's cutting-edge prosthetics designed to
replace damaged or severed limbs.

14:32.650 --> 14:35.700
What they did to Victor is more
extensive than a severed limb.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.280
Who owns Cyntechnics?

14:39.660 --> 14:44.370
Guess what.
It is owned by LuthorCorp.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.550
We need to talk.

14:53.670 --> 14:56.050
And you should work on your entrance,
Clark.

14:56.180 --> 14:58.090
Bit abrupt, don't you think?

14:58.100 --> 15:00.350
What do you know about Cyntechnics?

15:00.890 --> 15:03.020
See, now that's exactly what I mean.

15:03.150 --> 15:07.150
No small talk, no pleasantries,
just straight to the accusations.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.240
I haven't accused you of anything.

15:09.400 --> 15:14.160
You don't have to.
Your righteous tone says it all.

15:14.660 --> 15:16.950
So, what am I supposed to have done
this time?

15:17.080 --> 15:20.960
How about turning Victor Stone
into a Tin Man without his consent?

15:21.080 --> 15:23.250
Victor Stone, the football player?

15:23.380 --> 15:25.380
I thought I read he died in a car crash.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.300
That's what Cyntechnics
wanted everyone to believe.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.670
Then maybe you should be
badgering Cyntechnics.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.840
I am. LuthorCorp bought them out
seven months ago.

15:34.590 --> 15:36.760
Clark, in the last quarter alone...

15:36.890 --> 15:40.560
LuthorCorp has sold or acquired
over a hundred small ventures.

15:40.730 --> 15:42.600
You don't know your own company?

15:43.190 --> 15:46.610
I'm saying
I run a multinational corporation.

15:46.730 --> 15:51.240
The complexity of keeping it operating
requires me to delegate responsibilities.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.240
If someone's abusing that "position..."

15:53.360 --> 15:56.570
I'll take the necessary steps
to rectify the situation.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.660
So will I.

16:15.180 --> 16:17.140
Victor?

16:17.930 --> 16:19.810
Victor?

16:24.020 --> 16:26.690
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.650
- Where's Clark?
- He went to go talk to Lex.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.030
You mean, Lex Luthor?

16:34.200 --> 16:37.870
Well, it turns out that LuthorCorp
owns the company that did this to you.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.330
Maybe I should go have a few words
with Luthor.

16:40.950 --> 16:43.410
Lex has done things in the past
that I don't "like..."

16:43.540 --> 16:46.000
but I can't believe
he has any part in this.

16:48.170 --> 16:49.880
He's different.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.420
So am I.

16:52.550 --> 16:56.340
- Only I didn't have a choice.
- Well, now you do.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.220
Between what?
Being a can opener or a Cuisinart?

17:00.390 --> 17:04.480
No, between telling the truth
to the woman you love or lying to her.

17:05.940 --> 17:09.690
- Clark told you about Katherine?
- Yeah.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.480
That's actually why I'm here.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.109
She's what kept me going
all those months in that lab.

17:18.240 --> 17:22.829
The thought of holding her in my arms
again.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.420
- Hey, where are you going?
- To find my girl.

17:33.550 --> 17:37.300
I don't know what I'm gonna tell her,
but at least I can... What the hell?

17:40.470 --> 17:42.260
Victor!

17:49.520 --> 17:51.480
Target acquired.

17:54.980 --> 17:57.240
Lana. Are you okay?

17:57.360 --> 17:59.530
Yeah, I'm okay.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.540
That makes one of us.

18:07.710 --> 18:11.420
No one's gonna look for us here.
Lois won't be back till tomorrow.

18:11.540 --> 18:14.050
Go lie down. I'll get you a towel.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.970
Kent, I'm sorry. I never meant to bring
my crazy world into your life.

18:19.090 --> 18:21.550
Don't worry about it, all right?
You're safe now.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.930
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Here.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.020
I'm not so sure.

18:26.140 --> 18:29.770
This isn't exactly something
you can just put a little duct tape on.

18:41.070 --> 18:43.780
The bionics and my biology
are all connected.

18:43.910 --> 18:48.620
This goop coming out of my arm,
it's from my power cell.

18:50.960 --> 18:55.380
If it continues to drain like this
I'm a dead man.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.440
So my probing exposé
on the increase in jaywalking can wait.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.730
- We need to find this doctor.
- I don't know how much time he has.

19:16.860 --> 19:20.450
I know Lex likes to play hardball,
but sending snipers into your backyard?

19:20.570 --> 19:23.110
- It just doesn't seem like his style.
- Styles change.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.620
When I asked him about Cyntechnics,
he was lying.

19:25.740 --> 19:27.410
Maybe he was telling the truth.

19:27.540 --> 19:31.660
The lead scientist, Dr. Allister Krieg,
he has a history of burning bridges.

19:31.830 --> 19:35.540
He was fired from both MIT and Stanford
for using their funding to conduct...

19:35.670 --> 19:38.670
- ethically challenged research.
- Think he's doing the same?

19:38.800 --> 19:42.180
Luthor's obsession with scientific
advancement makes him a target.

19:42.300 --> 19:45.930
Doesn't matter. What matters is finding
the guy who can save Victor's life.

19:46.050 --> 19:48.890
- Okay, do you have a name?
- Dr. Hong.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.850
There are six Hongs with M.D.'s
in the Metropolis area...

19:52.980 --> 19:55.650
and I'm thinking we can cross off
the OB/GYN.

19:55.770 --> 19:58.070
Bio-engineer, right there.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.320
There you go.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.620
Dr. Hong?

20:16.420 --> 20:19.000
Dr. Hong, are you there?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.960
Is he dead?

20:54.460 --> 20:57.250
I think you already know that answer,
Lex.

21:00.630 --> 21:02.670
You think
I had something to do with this?

21:02.800 --> 21:06.220
Why else would you be here?
You acted like you never heard of them.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.355
I hadn't. But after you waved
the red flag, I looked into it.

21:09.475 --> 21:12.945
- Do you expect me to believe that?
- Believe what you want.

21:13.395 --> 21:15.775
Dr. Hong was about to
blow the whistle...

21:15.905 --> 21:19.735
and either he couldn't live with it
or the man in charge wouldn't let him.

21:19.865 --> 21:23.205
- You talking about Allister Krieg?
- You've done your homework.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.375
Look, Krieg's gone completely rogue.

21:25.495 --> 21:29.375
A project that started as an effort
to allow amputees to live a normal life...

21:29.495 --> 21:32.915
has turned into one man's quest
to create a living machine.

21:33.085 --> 21:37.135
If you know where Victor is, you need
to tell me before Krieg finds him first.

21:39.305 --> 21:40.765
He's sick. He's been shot.

21:42.345 --> 21:44.845
He said if he doesn't get repaired,
he may die.

21:45.015 --> 21:47.685
Then bring him to me.
I have the technology.

21:47.805 --> 21:51.895
- I can help Victor without involving Krieg.
- I've seen the way you help people.

21:52.605 --> 21:55.695
Look, I know you have your issues
with me. I know you're angry.

21:55.855 --> 21:59.655
But do you want to let our differences
get in the way of saving Victor's life?

22:09.535 --> 22:12.585
What happened? Did Clark find him?

22:20.385 --> 22:23.055
I'm so sorry, Victor.

22:24.515 --> 22:26.345
Dr. Hong's dead.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.395
Because of me.

22:38.155 --> 22:42.365
If he hadn't... If he hadn't helped me
escape, he'd still be alive right now.

22:42.485 --> 22:45.115
It's not your fault, Victor.

22:45.245 --> 22:48.745
You didn't choose for any of this
to happen to you.

22:50.705 --> 22:53.875
I always said I should have died
with my family.

22:54.005 --> 22:56.665
Guess I'll be joining them soon enough.

22:57.295 --> 23:00.635
You can't say that.
You can't give up hope, okay?

23:02.175 --> 23:04.635
I need to see Katherine.

23:07.475 --> 23:10.435
Victor, they're still searching for you.
You can hardly walk.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.185
I don't care.
I'm gonna see her before I die.

23:13.315 --> 23:17.395
- Okay, let's just wait for Clark.
- I'm not waiting for anybody.

23:17.525 --> 23:21.865
If you had one last chance to see
the person you love, what would you do?

23:29.615 --> 23:31.575
Katherine!

23:32.745 --> 23:34.995
Katherine!

23:36.625 --> 23:38.755
Hello, Victor.

23:40.425 --> 23:43.425
- Where's Katherine?
- She's safe.

23:43.545 --> 23:46.095
And she'll stay that way,
as long as you cooperate.

23:46.215 --> 23:50.265
If you so much as touch her,
I swear to God...

23:50.765 --> 23:53.515
I'm a doctor, Victor.

23:53.645 --> 23:57.645
My goal is to help people,
not to hurt them.

23:58.185 --> 24:00.605
Don't play with me, doc.

24:01.445 --> 24:04.275
- I wanna see her.
- You will.

24:04.405 --> 24:09.115
But first you'll return to the lab,
with these gentlemen.

24:13.495 --> 24:16.795
I hope you win your Nobel Prize.

24:25.135 --> 24:26.675
You were right.

24:26.805 --> 24:29.805
He came here like a fish to water.

24:29.925 --> 24:34.765
Yeah, well, the heart has a way
of clouding one's better judgment.

24:46.905 --> 24:49.325
Did you bring the money?

24:49.995 --> 24:52.575
Yes. Who are you?

24:52.705 --> 24:54.955
Why are you doing this?

25:02.505 --> 25:04.255
Lionel.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.980
What are you doing here?

25:06.990 --> 25:09.160
Well, I could ask you that same question.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.960
You have no idea what you just did.

25:12.080 --> 25:17.840
I got worried, Martha. I saw that
package at your house this morning.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.420
I know you don't want to
accept help from me...

25:20.550 --> 25:24.010
but I can't just sit back
and let you walk into trouble alone.

25:24.130 --> 25:28.350
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do. I recognize the signs.

25:28.470 --> 25:32.230
You're a senator. You've got
a high profile. You're in the public eye.

25:32.350 --> 25:34.560
Blackmail comes with the territory.

25:35.810 --> 25:37.230
So...

25:37.360 --> 25:39.690
what does one do in this position?

25:39.820 --> 25:42.280
You can't give in to blackmail,
it never ends.

25:43.530 --> 25:45.740
You don't understand.
There's a lot at stake.

25:45.860 --> 25:49.530
- There always is. Let me help you.
- No, Lionel, I can handle it.

25:49.660 --> 25:51.370
Yes, you're a very capable "woman..."

25:51.490 --> 25:54.210
but this is something
quite beyond your experience.

25:55.960 --> 25:59.920
What came to you in that package
is of no interest to me.

26:00.040 --> 26:02.300
My only interest is your well-being.

26:02.920 --> 26:06.180
Let me take care of this for you.
Please.

26:28.410 --> 26:30.870
Where's Katherine?

26:31.830 --> 26:36.330
Back at home. But don't worry,
we've called off the dogs.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.420
You'll be happy that
we've replaced the "tubing..."

26:40.130 --> 26:42.630
re-calibrated a few
of the servo-mechanisms.

26:42.750 --> 26:44.920
Your arm is even better than before.

26:45.050 --> 26:47.430
Can't wait to use it
to smash your skull in.

26:49.090 --> 26:50.970
How you feeling?

26:53.720 --> 26:57.140
Victor, I'm glad we managed
to get to you in time to save you.

26:58.140 --> 27:00.810
You got some kind of God complex
or something?

27:00.940 --> 27:02.320
I didn't ask to be saved.

27:02.820 --> 27:07.070
Look, all I'm doing is giving you a future,
a chance for a normal life.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.820
Normal? Half my body is straight
out of The Sharper Image catalog.

27:10.950 --> 27:13.990
At a price a lot steeper
than 6 million dollars...

27:14.120 --> 27:16.700
the last thing I wanna do
is cause you more pain.

27:16.830 --> 27:19.210
Then why not take back
all your fancy gadgetry?

27:19.330 --> 27:22.080
Roll my sorry stump out
in a wheelbarrow for all I care.

27:22.210 --> 27:25.380
You'd die without this gadgetry.

27:25.510 --> 27:27.670
But I'm as eager for your freedom
as you are.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.680
You just need to be patient.

27:31.550 --> 27:32.930
What's that?

27:37.020 --> 27:40.480
It's gonna make life easier for you.

27:42.440 --> 27:43.940
What are you doing to me?

27:44.980 --> 27:48.110
What am I doing?
I'm helping you be whole again.

27:50.030 --> 27:51.660
Anger...

27:51.780 --> 27:54.740
despair, loneliness.

27:55.370 --> 27:59.540
Such strong emotions can create
a rift between brain and bionics.

27:59.660 --> 28:03.330
This chip will take the edge off
when necessary.

28:03.460 --> 28:06.130
You're trying to turn me into a drone,
that's what.

28:06.250 --> 28:08.550
- A robot.
- Vic...

28:09.840 --> 28:12.180
Easy.

28:12.300 --> 28:15.100
You've read too much science fiction.

28:15.220 --> 28:19.680
Pacemakers,
synthetic tissues, artificial hearts.

28:19.810 --> 28:22.520
The merging of man and machine
is nothing new.

28:29.110 --> 28:30.860
I'll get out of your way.

28:30.990 --> 28:32.990
Keep me updated.

28:33.110 --> 28:34.820
I'll prep him for the implant.

28:44.630 --> 28:46.880
Lana, where's Victor?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.510
- He left.
- What?

28:49.630 --> 28:51.510
He wasn't supposed to leave.

28:51.630 --> 28:54.180
He wanted to see Katherine
one last time.

28:54.300 --> 28:58.760
- That's the first place they'll look.
- I tried to stop him, he wouldn't listen.

28:58.890 --> 29:01.140
Do you think they brought him back
to that lab?

29:01.270 --> 29:05.100
- I'm gonna go check that out.
- We should call the police.

29:05.230 --> 29:09.110
These people have shot at us before.
Who knows what they're gonna...

29:20.330 --> 29:23.160
Just relax, Victor.
This won't take long.

29:23.620 --> 29:26.170
You want me to relax,
put away the drill.

29:26.830 --> 29:31.670
When we're done, I promise you,
you'll feel like a new man.

29:47.400 --> 29:49.690
Nice tackle.

29:49.820 --> 29:53.030
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

29:59.740 --> 30:03.370
- How did you do that, Kent?
- I can do a lot of things.

30:28.480 --> 30:29.860
Clark.

30:29.980 --> 30:32.110
Gonna try some small talk
first this time?

30:32.230 --> 30:36.150
Like how Victor Stone
escaped from the lab?

30:37.280 --> 30:38.660
I guess not.

30:38.780 --> 30:42.370
That's everything that Chloe and I
could find on the Machina Project.

30:44.870 --> 30:48.040
Well, there's nothing here about Krieg's
renegade experiment...

30:48.170 --> 30:51.250
I" haven't already uncovered.

30:53.960 --> 30:57.090
I have no desire to harass
Victor Stone.

30:57.220 --> 30:59.680
- He's suffered enough.
- Suffered because of you.

31:00.340 --> 31:03.260
- Clark...
- Lex, you were there in the lab.

31:03.390 --> 31:05.180
When they tried to put a chip in.

31:05.310 --> 31:06.980
I was there.

31:07.100 --> 31:09.480
- To stop Krieg.
- That's not what Victor said.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.980
Victor was under heavy anesthesia.

31:13.110 --> 31:16.110
He must have misconstrued
my intentions.

31:16.240 --> 31:19.070
Seems to happen a lot to you,
doesn't it?

31:24.330 --> 31:26.410
You think
he would have been better off...

31:26.540 --> 31:28.580
if" he'd died along with his family?

31:29.250 --> 31:31.500
You always think
the ends justify the means.

31:31.630 --> 31:35.840
What I think
is that some miracles have a price.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.970
But that doesn't make them
less profound.

31:41.390 --> 31:45.060
Tell Victor I hope he can move past
what happened.

31:45.180 --> 31:48.020
I assure him LuthorCorp has.

31:50.900 --> 31:53.610
You can let yourself out.

32:10.170 --> 32:12.260
Is everything working all right?

32:12.380 --> 32:15.010
I feel like a billion dollars...

32:15.390 --> 32:18.060
which probably isn't too far off.

32:18.350 --> 32:22.480
You really think Luthor's gonna let that
much money walk off into the sunset?

32:22.600 --> 32:24.690
I didn't give him a choice.

32:33.780 --> 32:36.450
I'd say thank "you..."

32:36.660 --> 32:38.280
but the words seem too small.

32:39.160 --> 32:41.660
And completely unnecessary.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.920
Your mom raised you modest,
didn't she?

32:46.040 --> 32:48.630
You're a hero, Kent.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.800
I'm not gonna forget
how much I owe you.

32:53.800 --> 32:57.260
Help someone else out
when they're in need. We'll call it even.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.030
Katherine.

33:30.670 --> 33:32.710
Victor?

33:35.090 --> 33:37.180
What happened?

33:37.300 --> 33:38.720
What did those men do to you?

33:44.060 --> 33:46.640
It's a long story.

33:50.940 --> 33:53.320
We got time.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.130
Lionel. Come in.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.760
- What happened? Did you...?
- Don't worry. It's been solved.

35:07.880 --> 35:12.220
The man responsible has agreed
never to contact you again.

35:12.350 --> 35:13.430
Who was he?

35:13.930 --> 35:17.560
He was a police academy dropout
turned warehouse security guard.

35:17.690 --> 35:20.480
He was trying to cash in
at somebody else's expense.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.530
Did he tell you what this was about?

35:24.650 --> 35:28.780
I didn't let him. I was only interested
in making sure he went away.

35:28.910 --> 35:30.910
And he did.

35:31.030 --> 35:33.160
Willingly.

35:37.710 --> 35:41.000
- But there is one thing that concerns me.
- What is it?

35:45.090 --> 35:49.130
You're a public figure now, senator.

35:50.050 --> 35:53.100
How people perceive you is...

35:53.510 --> 35:54.890
It's everything.

35:55.930 --> 35:59.600
It's possible
that any association with me...

36:00.480 --> 36:03.020
with Lionel Luthor...

36:03.150 --> 36:05.110
could be dangerous
to your new career.

36:06.190 --> 36:09.070
I'm not the kind of person
who turns her back on friends...

36:09.200 --> 36:12.240
because of what people think.

36:16.790 --> 36:20.370
I don't know many people like you,
Martha.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.500
I admire your integrity so much.

36:26.960 --> 36:31.220
The state of Kansas
is lucky to have you.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.070
I haven't seen that in a while.

36:53.990 --> 36:56.620
I guess Victor kind of reminded me
of the glory days.

36:57.450 --> 37:00.040
Why'd you quit, anyway?

37:00.160 --> 37:03.920
You... You always seemed
so at peace on that field.

37:04.040 --> 37:09.010
Like everything that was weighing
you down just evaporated.

37:10.550 --> 37:12.510
It's just a game.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.050
Clark, why do you do that?

37:16.720 --> 37:18.100
Do what?

37:18.220 --> 37:20.350
Hide what you're really feeling.

37:27.690 --> 37:30.530
Seeing Victor and Katherine together...

37:30.650 --> 37:33.200
how in love they are...

37:33.320 --> 37:36.780
it kind of reminded me
of our glory days.

37:40.620 --> 37:43.330
And you know how much I love you,
Clark.

37:47.380 --> 37:51.960
But we seem to just
keep going around and around.

37:52.510 --> 37:55.220
- We can't move forward.
- I know.

37:58.140 --> 38:01.220
Just tell me the truth, Clark.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.640
Do you still love me?

38:04.770 --> 38:06.940
I've always loved you.

38:08.230 --> 38:10.190
And I always will.

38:10.320 --> 38:11.690
No matter what happens.

40:03.640 --> 40:06.350
Your secret is safe with me...

40:14.520 --> 40:16.280
Kal-El.
