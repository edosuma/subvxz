WEBVTT

02:19.958 --> 02:21.917
Woe unto man.

02:21.917 --> 02:25.042
Brave Achilles,
slain in trial by blood...

02:25.125 --> 02:28.042
for prize,
the bride of Menelaus.

02:28.125 --> 02:31.917
And father of Antigone,
ruler of Thebes,

02:31.917 --> 02:35.917
self-rendered sightless
by lust for expiation.

02:36.042 --> 02:39.334
Lost victim
of bewildered desire.

02:39.417 --> 02:42.125
Nor has Jason's wife
fared better.

02:42.209 --> 02:46.500
Giving life only to reclaim it
in vengeful fury.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.000
For to understand
the ways of the heart...

02:49.125 --> 02:52.625
is to grasp as clearly the malice
or ineptitude of the gods,

02:52.708 --> 02:56.292
who, in their vain and clumsy labors
to create a flawless surrogate,

02:56.417 --> 02:59.417
have left mankind
but dazed and incomplete.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.500
Take, for instance,
the case of Lenny Weinrib,

03:02.583 --> 03:07.084
a tale as Greek and timeless
as fate itself.

03:07.084 --> 03:09.583
- Lenny, let's have a baby.
- Hey!

03:09.583 --> 03:12.583
A baby? Why? Because she's pregnant,
you want to have a baby?

03:12.583 --> 03:14.667
- No. It's a great idea.
- You could raise your own middleweight.

03:14.792 --> 03:16.667
- I don't want a middleweight.
- Flyweight.

03:16.792 --> 03:20.084
- No, it'd be fun.
- Have you ever had children?

03:20.084 --> 03:22.875
- No, I've never had children.
- Why not?

03:22.958 --> 03:25.792
What do you mean, "why not?" 'Cause my
first wife didn't want to have a child.

03:25.875 --> 03:28.084
- Then I never remarried really, so--
- Oh, that's great.

03:28.084 --> 03:30.084
- What am I, chopped liver?
- Until now.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.084
- Yeah?
- I never-- You didn't let me finish.

03:32.167 --> 03:34.167
- No, you'd forgotten.
- Now you've changed your mind.
You didn't want to have a child.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.875
- You should have kids.
- It's like stereo. Give him a break.

03:37.959 --> 03:40.250
- You don't want a kid?
- Oh, we--

03:40.250 --> 03:44.959
When we first met, she didn't like
the beach; she hated the Hamptons;

03:44.959 --> 03:48.334
she didn't want to have kids;
she loved the Upper East Side,
she didn't want to move.

03:48.334 --> 03:51.334
Now suddenly she's making noise about
having a kid and moving to Tribeca.

03:51.459 --> 03:54.750
- Only if the gallery moves downtown.
- Well, being pregnant is great.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.833
-  Yeah?
- I love it. You get treated
like the Queen of England.

03:56.959 --> 03:58.833
- Sure.
- You say that like it's a good thing.

03:58.959 --> 04:00.833
- Well, I like the pampering.
- She does like it.

04:00.917 --> 04:02.833
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's fantastic.

04:02.917 --> 04:04.917
I can't give up the time
right now.

04:04.917 --> 04:07.125
There are too many exciting things
happening in my business.

04:07.251 --> 04:09.125
- So let me ask you a question.
- What?

04:09.209 --> 04:12.541
How do you plan to swing it without
being pregnant? I'm curious.

04:12.541 --> 04:14.541
- Good question. Very good question.
- No, it's easy.

04:14.625 --> 04:16.625
- We'll adopt. Oh, well.
- Mmm.

04:16.708 --> 04:18.625
- Not me. I don't want to adopt.
-  There you go.

04:18.708 --> 04:20.625
- Why not? That's a good idea.
- No. No.

04:20.708 --> 04:23.209
- You must be nuts. With, with my genes?
- Yeah?

04:23.334 --> 04:25.625
- To adopt? I have award-winning genes.
- Oh, God.

04:25.708 --> 04:28.209
- I want to pass them on.
- No, that's crazy. No, the--

04:28.292 --> 04:31.125
It's for the same reason
we don't lease a car, okay?

04:31.209 --> 04:33.125
- 'Cause it's pride of ownership.
- Okay.

04:33.209 --> 04:35.209
- And I don't want to adopt a child.
- No. Look, I'm sorry, Lenny.

04:35.292 --> 04:38.084
It's crazy 'cause the world
is full of needy kids.

04:38.209 --> 04:40.084
- You know, she's right.
-  That's true.

04:40.209 --> 04:42.084
- I know, but that-- You know, but I--
- No, I mean it.

04:42.209 --> 04:45.792
Why overpopulate the world when there
are thousands of parent-less kids?

04:45.875 --> 04:48.209
Just because you don't want
to get morning sickness, right?

04:48.209 --> 04:50.292
- No, it's not true.
- That's why you want to adopt a kid.

04:50.376 --> 04:52.500
I just can't afford
to give up a year just now.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.167
Forget it. Subject is closed.
I don't wanna--

04:55.292 --> 04:57.667
I'd be afraid that
I might get a bad seed.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.667
- Oh, you're paranoid.
- Oh, come on.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.667
That's right! What-- You read that
in the tabloids all the time.

05:02.792 --> 05:04.667
- No. A bad seed.
- That's right.

05:04.792 --> 05:07.167
Yeah, we adopt some sweet little boy,
and then he turns 13,

05:07.251 --> 05:09.875
we'd go to sleep at night,
he'd split our head open with an axe.

05:09.959 --> 05:12.875
Listen, why'd you have to
go and tell him that? You know
Lenny's got a vivid imagination.

05:12.875 --> 05:15.167
- It's a common occurrence.
- I read the same paper.
What do you want me to tell you?

05:15.251 --> 05:18.542
Anyway, what do you mean "he"?
Why can't we adopt a girl?

05:18.542 --> 05:20.667
- We're not adopting anything.
I want no sex.
- A little girl.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.251
Let the guy have a short stop
or a point guard, will ya?

05:23.251 --> 05:25.542
Can we get a check? Can we--
Can we please get out of here?

05:25.667 --> 05:27.750
I'll take the check.
I'm paying tonight.

05:27.750 --> 05:29.834
- Yes.
- You? I'm stunned.

05:29.959 --> 05:34.042
You pay, you break your record.
You-- One more and you break
DiMaggio's record-- 56 straight.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.042
That's not true.
Now, be nice.

05:36.125 --> 05:39.125
Laius, proud father, speak.

05:39.251 --> 05:42.542
I, with joy,
did have a son...

05:42.625 --> 05:45.542
so fair, so clearheaded
and brave,

05:45.625 --> 05:49.209
that I a thousand pleasures
did derive from his presence.

05:49.334 --> 05:51.209
So what happens?

05:51.334 --> 05:53.417
One day he kills me.

05:53.417 --> 05:56.334
And don't you think,
he runs off and marries my wife.

05:56.417 --> 05:59.334
Poor Oedipus, king of Thebes.

05:59.417 --> 06:02.917
My son, my son
did slay unwittingly...

06:03.000 --> 06:04.917
my noble husband...

06:05.000 --> 06:07.792
and did, without realizing,
hasten with me,

06:07.917 --> 06:10.792
his loving mother,
to lustful bed.

06:10.917 --> 06:13.126
And a whole profession
was born...

06:13.209 --> 06:15.500
charging sometimes
200 an hour,

06:15.583 --> 06:17.708
and a 50-minute hour
at that.

06:17.792 --> 06:21.209
And why a child now, out of left field?

06:21.292 --> 06:24.292
One hopes it's not to fill
some growing void in their marriage.

06:24.376 --> 06:26.292
Leave her be.

06:26.376 --> 06:29.084
A woman's urge to motherhood
is old as the earth.

06:29.209 --> 06:31.792
Children grow up;
they move out.

06:31.875 --> 06:34.875
Sometimes to ridiculous places
like Cincinnati...

06:35.000 --> 06:36.875
or Boise, Idaho.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.875
Then you never see them again.

06:38.959 --> 06:41.376
You'd think once in a while
they'd pick up a phone.

06:41.376 --> 06:44.167
But is there a growing void
in the Weinrib's marriage?

06:44.167 --> 06:46.167
We didn't say there was.

06:46.167 --> 06:49.084
We're all just speculating
on possible motives.

06:49.167 --> 06:51.167
Children are serious stuff.

06:51.167 --> 06:54.959
Look, here's a man
who killed his father...

06:55.084 --> 06:56.959
and slept with his mother.

06:57.042 --> 07:00.459
I hate to tell you what they
call my son in Harlem.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.542
Hello.

07:04.667 --> 07:08.167
- There's a baby we can adopt.
- Are you serious?

07:08.251 --> 07:11.459
I spoke to Carolyn Hester
and she's found an infant for us.

07:11.459 --> 07:14.959
- But we have to act quickly.
- I don't want a kid.

07:14.959 --> 07:17.042
Well, Lenny, you know
how hard it is.

07:17.042 --> 07:19.750
And look, the baby's
one day old, totally healthy.

07:19.834 --> 07:21.917
Unwed mother, no diseases.

07:21.917 --> 07:24.042
And it's a boy.
You wanted a boy.

07:24.126 --> 07:26.542
Amanda, I can't get
into this with you now.

07:26.625 --> 07:28.917
This is not the place
to have this discussion.

07:28.917 --> 07:31.708
I told Carolyn to be on the lookout.
She's experienced with adoptions.

07:31.708 --> 07:35.126
She knows what she's doing.
It's a boy, healthy, born this morning.

07:35.209 --> 07:37.500
No strings,
if we act quickly.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.709
Le-- Look, I-- I gotta
put my foot down.

07:40.709 --> 07:44.334
I-I-- If you want to
discuss this another time, we can.

07:44.418 --> 07:48.000
But if you gotta have a fast answer,
it's definitely "no."

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
- Hi! Hi.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.126
- You got his head?
- He's adorable.

07:52.209 --> 07:54.418
- Yes. Oh, God.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.792
This is great. This kid is never
going to be a fighter, you know.

07:57.917 --> 08:01.875
I gotta run out and get some weights
because he's really light as a feather.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.292
- Yeah, perhaps I should have him back.
- Hi.

08:04.292 --> 08:06.376
Yeah. Maybe you better
hold him 'cause he's crying.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.376
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- He's crying.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.792
- Okay. Okay. It's okay. It's okay.

08:10.875 --> 08:12.792
- That's a good boy.
- That's so great.

08:12.875 --> 08:16.084
If there's any greatness in my hands,
let it pass into your body.

08:16.084 --> 08:19.875
- Get a grip on yourself.
- This kid is gonna be a great kid!

08:19.959 --> 08:21.875
- Oh, yeah.
- He's fabulous!

08:21.959 --> 08:23.875
- You're okay now.
- What do you wanna call him?

08:23.959 --> 08:25.875
- Oh, this is unbelievable. Yeah.
- Call him?

08:25.959 --> 08:29.084
- Oh, wh-- what about Eric?
- Eric? The kid's not a Viking.

08:29.167 --> 08:31.959
I wanna call him, name him,
you know, for one of my heroes.

08:32.084 --> 08:35.167
- Like what?
- I don't know. What about Groucho?

08:35.251 --> 08:38.042
- Groucho? Oh, get real.
- No, I'm serious.

08:38.167 --> 08:40.750
It's a great-- You know.
I-- I don't know. What--

08:40.875 --> 08:43.251
What about Phineas?
Do you like Phineas?

08:43.376 --> 08:45.251
Phineas?
Are you joking?

08:45.334 --> 08:47.834
Phineas is the guy who
forecloses on the mortgage.

08:47.959 --> 08:50.750
I don't want to call this kid
Phineas. He's adorable.

08:50.750 --> 08:53.834
- That's so great.
What-- What, uh-- Let me think.
- Well.

08:53.959 --> 08:55.834
- What about Django?
- Django?

08:55.959 --> 08:58.459
Django, yeah. After Django Reinhardt,
the great guitar player.

08:58.459 --> 09:02.251
- Django Weinrib?
- That's the curse of the Weinrib name.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.542
- It doesn't go with anything.
Nothing goes with Weinrib.
- Well, okay, okay.

09:04.625 --> 09:07.126
What about something simple
like, you know, Ben?

09:07.251 --> 09:09.334
- You want to call him Ben Weinrib?
- Yeah.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.709
What, he's gonna be
a-a-a gin rummy champion?

09:11.834 --> 09:14.334
- I mean, you know.
- Yeah, well, you want to deny
your heritage? Huh?

09:14.418 --> 09:16.917
Well, you know, I-I just want
the kid to have a great name.

09:17.001 --> 09:19.500
- Yeah.
- What about Sugar Ray Weinrib?

09:19.500 --> 09:21.500
Holden,
after Holden Caulfield.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.834
You see, Holden is one of those things
that works if we use your maiden name.

09:24.834 --> 09:28.418
- If it's Holden Sloane,
but not Holden Weinrib.
- Yeah.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.709
The kid is so cute!

09:30.792 --> 09:33.293
I can't believe he's--
What about Cole?

09:33.293 --> 09:36.084
- Cole?
- Cole Weinrib. Harpo Weinrib.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.709
- Harpo? No.
- How about Earl the Pearl Weinrib?

09:38.792 --> 09:41.418
- That would be so perfect.
- Oh, God! No.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.293
- Okay, what-- what about Shane?
You like the name Shane?
- Yeah.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.293
- Shane's pretty.
- Shane would be okay.

09:46.376 --> 09:50.500
On the other hand, you wouldn't want
a Supreme Court Justice called Shane.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.167
Oh, Jesus.
I got it. I got it.

09:53.167 --> 09:55.293
Brilliant.
This is so brilliant.

09:55.293 --> 09:57.293
- Got it? Ready? Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

09:57.293 --> 10:00.792
- Thelonius Weinrib.
- Max! What about Max?

10:00.792 --> 10:02.875
- Max?
- Yeah, Max.

10:02.875 --> 10:05.084
Max.
Oh, look how cute he is.

10:05.167 --> 10:07.459
- I wanna hold him. Max is okay.
- He's so sweet. He's smiling.

10:07.584 --> 10:09.959
- Dr. Max Weinrib. I like the name Max.
- Yeah, Max is good.

10:10.084 --> 10:13.251
- It's simple.
- How about Senator Max Weinrib?

10:13.376 --> 10:16.376
- Little tongue.
- Rabbi Max-- Rabbi Max Weinrib?

10:16.459 --> 10:18.959
No. Maybe we should
rethink Max for a minute.

10:19.042 --> 10:22.376
- Oh, he's so great.
- He's happy. I think he likes us.

10:22.459 --> 10:24.959
- He looks like you.
- He looks like me?

10:24.959 --> 10:26.459
Yeah.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.334
He looks like Broderick
Crawford a little bit.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.917
- He's so smart.
- Yeah.

10:58.001 --> 11:00.126
He picks up on everything.

11:00.209 --> 11:03.917
He's got a great personality.
You know, you wake him up,
he's always smiling and upbeat.

11:03.917 --> 11:05.917
- Like me.
- You were like that
when you were a baby.

11:05.917 --> 11:08.418
- Yeah, he's so verbal.
- Well, he's around a writer...

11:08.500 --> 11:10.500
and an art expert, right?

11:10.625 --> 11:13.126
Listen, when are you going
to move the gallery downtown?

11:13.126 --> 11:16.084
Yeah, Mother, we don't want to get
into that discussion 'cause, you know,

11:16.209 --> 11:20.293
I think we should move and Lenny
is a devoted Upper East-sider.

11:20.418 --> 11:23.376
Or shall I say is opposed
to change in any form?

11:23.500 --> 11:25.500
-  I don't know.
- It's unbelievable.

11:25.584 --> 11:29.084
The kid is unbelievable. I got him
trains, he put 'em together himself.

11:29.209 --> 11:32.168
Trains? I thought you
bought him an Erector Set.

11:32.293 --> 11:34.792
I got him an Erector Set, yeah.
And-- And I also got him this tricycle.

11:34.792 --> 11:37.376
- Wait. And the whole plastic kitchen?
- Max, I got you a tricycle.

11:37.376 --> 11:39.376
Lenny, you can't
buy him so much.

11:39.376 --> 11:41.584
- Max, I got you a tricycle.
- Look at that!

11:41.667 --> 11:44.584
- You can't buy him so much stuff.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.876
- No, no. I also got him skates.
- Skates?

11:46.876 --> 11:50.584
Yeah. And I got a couple more things
on the way in, you know.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.876
A small truck is gonna pull up
in front of the house.

11:52.959 --> 11:55.667
- What are you gonna get next year?
- Does anyone want anything to drink?

11:56.876 --> 11:58.750
- Go ahead. Shoot.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.750
Try again.

12:00.750 --> 12:03.667
You ever think about what you want
to be when you grow up, Max?

12:03.750 --> 12:07.251
Hmm, I don't know.
Maybe an interior decorator.

12:07.251 --> 12:09.542
- What?
- Just kidding, just kidding.

12:09.542 --> 12:12.042
Well, don't kid.
Here. Come on.

12:20.418 --> 12:23.334
Okay, those go in the bedroom.
Okay, you follow me.

12:23.418 --> 12:25.834
- Give me a hand with this.
- Why did we move?

12:25.917 --> 12:28.209
What do you mean,
"Why did we move?" I told you.

12:28.209 --> 12:30.834
We moved 'cause-- 'cause, you know,
'cause your mother wanted to move.

12:30.917 --> 12:35.334
'Cause, you know, the art gallery
she works at has moved downtown...

12:35.334 --> 12:37.625
and, you know,
she wanted to move.

12:37.625 --> 12:40.001
- Here's your football.
- Who's the boss between you and Mommy?

12:40.126 --> 12:43.126
- What is the question?
- Who's the boss between you and Mommy?

12:43.126 --> 12:45.126
Who is the boss?
You have to ask that?

12:45.126 --> 12:47.293
- You don't know who the boss
is between me and Mommy?
- No.

12:47.418 --> 12:51.500
I'm the boss, okay? Mommy--
Mommy's only the decision maker.

12:51.625 --> 12:54.500
You know, there's a difference
between, uh--

12:54.584 --> 12:58.584
You know, Mommy-- Mommy says
what we do and, and, uh,

12:58.709 --> 13:01.792
I have control
of the channel changer.

13:01.876 --> 13:04.293
- Here-- Here's your crayons.
- Thanks.

13:04.376 --> 13:07.584
We're new in the neighborhood
and we want Max to be really
in the best school.

13:07.709 --> 13:10.293
- Oh, but this is it.
- It's 'cause he's a very,
very bright kid.

13:10.376 --> 13:12.293
- I mean, really bright.
- Yeah, he's really great.

13:12.376 --> 13:14.792
Yes, I know. I saw his test scores
and they're wonderful.

13:14.876 --> 13:17.168
- They are. Yeah.
- I know. And he's got
a great sense of humor.

13:17.168 --> 13:20.584
- He's a sweet kid.
He's a really sweet kid.
- He's got a great personality.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.876
Wonderful. Well, I wanted to talk
to you about a special program...

13:22.959 --> 13:24.876
that we have
for bright students.

13:24.959 --> 13:26.876
- Really? And he qualifies?

13:26.959 --> 13:28.959
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.
- Sorry. Excuse me.

13:29.084 --> 13:32.251
- Certainly.
- Because-- when you hear his syntax,

13:32.376 --> 13:34.376
- Hello? Oh, hi.
- it's amazing.

13:34.376 --> 13:36.667
- Verbal skills are telling.
- His vocabulary is good,
but his syntax is--

13:36.667 --> 13:38.667
- Oh, great.
- He speaks like a grown-up.

13:38.667 --> 13:40.751
- Sorry. Lenny?
- What we can do is--

13:40.876 --> 13:43.043
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- Oh, certainly.

13:43.168 --> 13:46.667
Can we meet the Dorians tonight
for dinner at Le Cirque?

13:46.751 --> 13:50.168
The Dorians? No. Because we have
tickets to the Edward Albee play.

13:50.168 --> 13:53.625
- Listen, I can't.
- We have to.
We've been waiting for so long.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.335
You don't have to go,
but I really should go.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.542
I, uh-- No.

13:58.625 --> 14:01.542
- This will be the second time
this week we cancelled something.
- Go with Bud.

14:01.542 --> 14:04.126
- Oh, okay.
- I don't want to go with Bud.
I'm not married to Bud.

14:04.251 --> 14:06.251
Listen, go.
Can we not discuss it now?

14:06.335 --> 14:08.834
Oh, my God!
That was embarrassing.

14:08.917 --> 14:12.917
Well, just because I don't
want to have dinner yet again
with the world's dullest couple.

14:13.043 --> 14:15.209
Yeah, well, someday they may
sponsor me for my own gallery.

14:15.335 --> 14:17.209
- I said I'd go. I'm going with you.
- Yeah?

14:17.335 --> 14:19.209
But we got tickets to a show.
It's a shame.

14:19.335 --> 14:22.001
This time try and join in and don't
sit there like some zombie all night.

14:22.126 --> 14:24.418
Hey, last time I joined in,
you got angry with me.

14:24.418 --> 14:27.709
Yeah, 'cause we were discussing
the l.M. Pei Museum, not Muhammad Ali.

14:27.792 --> 14:31.126
Well, my mind wandered.
I can't keep on those topics.

14:31.209 --> 14:35.001
I just don't want to be the motor power
of the Bender Gallery forever.

14:35.084 --> 14:37.001
I want the
Amanda Sloane Gallery.

14:37.084 --> 14:40.084
Not Amanda Weinrib,
'cause there's a euphony problem.

14:40.209 --> 14:44.584
Three, four, run.
Three, four, and break the ball.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.709
-  Play 88!
- I hope they don't play like this.

14:46.792 --> 14:48.876
- 88! Ten-hut!

14:49.001 --> 14:50.876
What's the matter?
You seem down.

14:51.001 --> 14:53.500
- No, I'm fine.
- You're fine?

14:53.584 --> 14:55.500
Something's on your mind,
Lenny.

14:55.584 --> 14:59.876
Listen, last night I was
at one of those dinner parties again.

14:59.959 --> 15:02.293
Amanda-- You know,
last week she took me to,

15:02.376 --> 15:04.293
to Le Cirque with the Dorians.

15:04.376 --> 15:08.251
And then last night it was
with the Grossbards on Park Avenue.

15:08.251 --> 15:11.959
And then after that,
we were driving home...

15:12.084 --> 15:13.959
and I don't know
what to say.

15:14.084 --> 15:18.168
It was Saturday night, you know, and we
stopped for a light over on Park Avenue.

15:18.168 --> 15:21.876
I looked out the window
and I see some guy and this pretty girl.

15:21.959 --> 15:24.751
And, you know,
they're walking home and, you know,

15:24.751 --> 15:26.959
the guy's carrying
the Sunday papers.

15:27.043 --> 15:30.460
It looked like they were
having so much fun, you know.

15:30.542 --> 15:32.959
And, you know--
I don't know, I--

15:33.043 --> 15:36.251
I remember how great it
used to be with me and Amanda...

15:36.335 --> 15:38.834
in our first apartment,
you know, how romantic it was.

15:38.834 --> 15:42.251
You know, in those days it was
just a kick shopping together...

15:42.335 --> 15:46.251
or, you know, just walking
the New York streets, you know.

15:46.335 --> 15:49.209
Then when Max came,
everything was so great, you know.

15:49.335 --> 15:51.418
We had such terrific times.

15:51.542 --> 15:56.043
I don't know, it's been so long
since there's been, you know,
the old passion between us.

15:56.043 --> 15:59.418
I don't know, but it was the first time
I had any of those thoughts.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.126
And, you know,
they made me feel nervous.

16:04.792 --> 16:07.500
You weren't too pleasant
this evening.

16:07.626 --> 16:10.918
Why, 'cause I said no about going
to your boss Jerry Bender's house...

16:11.001 --> 16:12.918
- in the Hamptons?
- I'll be fine.

16:13.001 --> 16:15.084
I don't like the Hamptons. You know,
you used to hate the beach yourself.

16:15.084 --> 16:17.210
Yeah, not the way he lives.
It's private and beautiful.

16:17.293 --> 16:19.584
What are you getting
so angry about?

16:19.709 --> 16:21.792
- 'Cause you won't come.
- Last time we went, I got a tick.

16:21.876 --> 16:24.876
- A tick? Oh, wow. Big deal.
- For you, it wasn't a big deal.

16:25.001 --> 16:27.792
- But I took my pants off, I had
a black thing living in my leg.
- Everyone will be there.

16:27.876 --> 16:29.876
For the potential contacts,
I can put up with a few ticks.

16:30.001 --> 16:31.876
I don't-- What contacts?

16:32.001 --> 16:34.001
You know, it's like you're
an international spy.

16:34.084 --> 16:36.876
- You got contacts all over town.
- I plan to have my own gallery,
and soon.

16:37.001 --> 16:39.584
You've changed unbelievably
over the years.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.584
- Oh, yeah? You know what, Lenny?
- You used to hate that.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.876
- People grow. They grow. Some people.
- It's not growth.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.460
You used to hate the beach.
And Jerry Bender has got a crush on you.

16:46.460 --> 16:47.959
What?

16:47.959 --> 16:49.959
- This guy stares at you.
- Oh, no. That's nuts.

16:50.084 --> 16:51.959
- That's seriously crazy.
- He mentally undresses you.

16:52.084 --> 16:53.959
- That's his normal look.
- It's not his normal look.

16:54.084 --> 16:56.460
- If he looked at me that way
I'd hit him with a brick.
- Okay. Okay, let's--

16:56.542 --> 16:59.168
- Or kiss him on the lips, maybe.
- Let's drop this. Please?

17:05.168 --> 17:08.542
Well, what do you mean,
you couldn't find it?

17:08.542 --> 17:10.751
Well, I'm sorry.
You know, it's dark in here...

17:10.834 --> 17:14.126
and I-- you know,
we haven't done it in a while.

17:14.251 --> 17:16.542
- And then you got so angry at me.
- I wasn't angry.

17:16.626 --> 17:19.542
I wasn't angry. You were fumbling
and I was getting out of the mood.

17:19.626 --> 17:23.043
Sorry, I couldn't find it. This--
We haven't been doing it in a while.

17:23.126 --> 17:26.251
- Okay, let's not get into
a whole discussion here.
- I lost my sense of direction.

17:26.335 --> 17:28.210
I'm tired.

17:28.335 --> 17:30.542
Every marriage goes through
valleys and peaks.

17:30.626 --> 17:33.043
- This is like a valley.
- I don't mind going through a valley.

17:33.126 --> 17:36.709
- But I don't want to sink
beneath sea level here.
- Lenny, why rock the boat?

17:36.709 --> 17:40.001
You got a bright, beautiful wife.
You got a kid that you're crazy for.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.001
I'm not gonna rock the boat.
Did I tell you about Max?

17:42.126 --> 17:44.793
They want to put him in a special class
because he's got a high IQ.

17:44.918 --> 17:47.001
Yeah, well, two bright parents.
I mean, what do you expect?

17:47.126 --> 17:49.293
Yeah, whoever they are.
I mean, I still don't know.

17:49.418 --> 17:51.418
It's like raising thoroughbreds.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.501
This kid must come
from good stock.

17:53.584 --> 17:56.709
He's good-looking; he's got a high IQ;
he's got a great personality.

17:56.793 --> 17:58.418
And he's amusing.

17:58.501 --> 18:00.709
This is not my doing.
Amanda did the whole adoption.

18:00.793 --> 18:02.876
I just resisted.
I complained, like a jerk.

18:03.001 --> 18:07.001
I mean, a good father, a dynamite mother
produces a kid like Max.

18:07.001 --> 18:09.501
I think the father's dead,
you know.

18:11.168 --> 18:14.793
- The mother?

18:16.501 --> 18:18.460
Don't go any further!

18:18.460 --> 18:20.584
I know what you're thinking,
Lenny, and forget it.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.460
How can I forget it?
The thought's been put into my head.

18:23.584 --> 18:27.584
Oh, cursed fate. Certain thoughts
are better left unthunk.

18:27.667 --> 18:30.168
I'll bet this kid
has a dynamite mother.

18:30.251 --> 18:32.959
What makes you think he didn't
inherit everything from his father?

18:33.085 --> 18:35.667
Everything? That's very unlikely.
But I'm gonna find out.

18:35.751 --> 18:37.959
Let sleeping dogs lie.

18:38.043 --> 18:41.667
- I'll bet she's great.
- Curiosity. That's what kills us.

18:41.667 --> 18:45.168
Not muggers or all that bullshit
about the ozone layer.
It's our own hearts and minds.

18:45.168 --> 18:49.667
- I'm gonna find out.
- Please, Lenny, don't be a schmuck.

18:49.667 --> 18:54.834
I remember the adoption vaguely because
I'm somewhat friendly with Amanda.

18:54.959 --> 18:57.251
But it was not that long ago
that we-- that we did it.

18:57.335 --> 19:00.335
I recall trying to
expedite matters for her.

19:00.418 --> 19:05.043
I somehow think it was
a single parent with no father.

19:05.126 --> 19:08.626
Right. Exactly. So-So how--
Is it possible for me to get the name--

19:08.709 --> 19:10.626
I'd like the name
of the mother, if I could.

19:10.709 --> 19:12.626
That remains forever
in our files.

19:12.709 --> 19:16.709
Even if I have it, I can't give it
to you. May I ask why you want to know?

19:16.709 --> 19:18.709
Yes, 'cause I-I--
I'm curious about it...

19:18.709 --> 19:21.210
and I'm trying to get
all the information that I can.

19:21.335 --> 19:24.709
- So, so--
- I'm sorry. That's all
I can help you with.

19:24.793 --> 19:27.001
There's no possibility
of, uh--

19:27.126 --> 19:29.918
- No, those are the rules.
- I don't understand.
I'm the father of the child.

19:29.918 --> 19:33.793
- I can't find out who--
- They're very firm. It's never done.

19:33.918 --> 19:36.501
- Mm-hmm.
- How is the little boy doing?

19:36.584 --> 19:38.918
- Good. He's great. He's fabulous.
- Yes?

19:39.001 --> 19:42.001
- Yes.
- Say hello to Amanda.

19:42.085 --> 19:45.501
- There's no possibility that I could--
- I'm sorry.

19:45.584 --> 19:48.793
- There's--
- Really sorry. No way.

19:48.876 --> 19:51.876
- Okay, thank you. Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

20:56.210 --> 20:58.210
What are you doing, Weinrib?

20:58.210 --> 21:00.834
Don't confuse me!
She's coming back in a minute.

21:00.918 --> 21:04.210
- You are breaking the law.
- Breaking the law?
There's a higher law.

21:04.335 --> 21:06.918
I can find out
who my son's mother is.

21:06.918 --> 21:09.001
The judge won't see it
that way.

21:09.126 --> 21:11.501
Keep a lookout for me,
will you, for Christ's sake?

21:11.501 --> 21:14.584
- Me? I'm the leader of the Chorus.
- So what? Look out.

21:14.709 --> 21:16.584
Get your friend Bud
to help you.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.210
Bud can't help me. You know,
Ellie and Amanda are friendly.

21:19.293 --> 21:22.293
- Bud can't keep a secret.
- Why is it a secret?
Why can't Amanda know?

21:22.377 --> 21:24.501
What kind of argument am I
getting into with you? Amanda--

21:24.584 --> 21:26.501
'Cause she wouldn't understand.

21:26.584 --> 21:28.709
Oh, you're guilty because you
already have exaggerated notions...

21:28.709 --> 21:30.668
about your son's mother.

21:30.668 --> 21:34.085
It's understandable because things
are not going smoothly with Amanda.

21:34.168 --> 21:36.793
That's why you will always
be a chorus member.

21:36.876 --> 21:39.168
Because you don't do anything.
I act.

21:39.168 --> 21:41.377
I take action.
I make things happen.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.876
Well, hurry the hell up.
I hear footsteps.

21:47.751 --> 21:51.584
I-I forgot my-- I dropped
my manila envelope. I didn't realize it.

21:51.668 --> 21:54.168
- Oh.
- It has an important interview in it.

21:54.252 --> 21:56.168
With-- With Roberto Duran.

21:59.543 --> 22:02.668
You won't believe this,
but he's heading for Pennsylvania.

22:02.751 --> 22:04.751
Of all the human weaknesses,

22:04.835 --> 22:08.751
- obsession is the most dangerous.
-  And the silliest.

22:10.543 --> 22:13.460
- Yeah?
- I'm looking for a former tenant here,

22:13.460 --> 22:15.960
- a-a-a Leslie Wright.
- Who are you?

22:15.960 --> 22:18.126
I'm a friend of hers, and I believe
she lived here at one time--

22:18.252 --> 22:20.126
a Leslie Wright?

22:20.252 --> 22:22.543
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember
the girl who used to live here.

22:22.626 --> 22:24.543
- You remember.
The pretty one upstairs.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

22:24.626 --> 22:27.043
She was only here for a while.
Who are you?

22:27.043 --> 22:29.626
Uh, I'm just an old friend of hers
and I was trying to track her down.

22:29.709 --> 22:31.709
Do you know-- Do you know
where I could find her?

22:31.835 --> 22:34.709
Leslie Wailes was her name,
not Leslie Wright. Leslie Wailes.

22:34.835 --> 22:36.709
- Leslie Wailes?
- Wailes.

22:36.835 --> 22:39.210
- She moved to New York.
- You sure? 'Cause I have Leslie Wright.

22:39.335 --> 22:41.835
Leslie-- Leslie--
Did she get married or--

22:41.918 --> 22:43.918
I don't know.

22:44.001 --> 22:47.001
You have no other information?
You don't know where I could
find her or anything?

22:47.001 --> 22:49.501
No. She was only here
for a little while. I told you.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.918
Look, let me give you
my phone number.

22:51.918 --> 22:54.918
If anything turns up,
I would love to locate her.

22:58.793 --> 23:01.709
- Here. Give me that. I'll take that.
- Thank you.

23:01.793 --> 23:04.293
- Yeah. Okay.
- You're welcome.

23:06.001 --> 23:09.377
You have a phone call. Mr. Lamont.
Says he's from Philadelphia.

23:09.377 --> 23:11.377
- Oh.
- You gave him your number?

23:11.377 --> 23:14.168
- Mm-hmm.
-  Is this Lenny Weinrib?

23:14.293 --> 23:16.168
- Go ahead, sir.
- Hello.

23:16.293 --> 23:19.584
Yeah, this is Bill Lamont.
Um, that woman you were looking for--

23:19.668 --> 23:23.293
We asked another guy who said
her name was Leslie St. James.

23:23.293 --> 23:26.460
Said she moved to New York City,
talked about becoming an actress.

23:26.460 --> 23:28.960
- Leslie St. James?
- Yes, sir. Yeah.

23:29.085 --> 23:33.876
He remembered her quite well.
Leslie St. James is the name she took.

23:33.876 --> 23:39.377
There was a Leslie St. James who was
a member of the Screen Extras Guild.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.543
- So that's that.
- So what are you telling me?

23:41.668 --> 23:45.460
That-- That she was a movie
extra or stage extra?

23:45.460 --> 23:47.668
Yeah.
That's all I have.

23:47.668 --> 23:49.751
So-- And there's an address,
but, uh, you know,

23:49.835 --> 23:53.252
this book's
a few years old. So.

23:53.335 --> 23:55.543
I'm looking for a--
it's-- she--

23:55.543 --> 23:58.335
A Leslie St. James
or maybe it's a Leslie Wailes.

23:58.460 --> 24:00.835
- I don't know,
but I think she lived here.
- Oh, yeah, sure. I remember.

24:00.918 --> 24:04.335
She was a tall girl.
She changed her name to Linda Ash.

24:04.419 --> 24:05.835
Linda Ash?

24:05.918 --> 24:08.419
Yeah, it was a fake name.
She-- She did sex movies.

24:08.543 --> 24:11.043
- Sex movies?
- Yeah, you know, like, uh, Deep Throat.

24:11.127 --> 24:14.419
Skin flicks.
Tall, blonde, hot.

24:14.543 --> 24:16.419
- Very hot.
- Really? Good-looking?

24:16.501 --> 24:18.918
Oh, great looking.
Tremendous body.

24:19.001 --> 24:21.419
- How you doin'?
- Hey, Lenny, how are ya?

24:21.501 --> 24:24.127
- Good. Can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah.

24:24.210 --> 24:27.710
- I need a favor.
- You got it. What?

24:27.710 --> 24:31.210
You got friends in the, uh,
the adult film business, right?

24:31.293 --> 24:33.293
My nephew knows them all.
Why?

24:33.293 --> 24:38.085
I'm trying to locate
an actress named Linda Ash.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.793
- You know which movies she did?
- No.

24:40.876 --> 24:42.876
I was in the video store
trying to get a video,

24:43.001 --> 24:45.085
but, you know, I get embarrassed
because my neighbor saw me there.

24:45.210 --> 24:47.501
- And, you know--
-  I hear ya.

24:47.501 --> 24:49.584
- Well, let me get back to you
on that one. All right?
- Yeah.

24:53.002 --> 24:55.085
You know, I don't know
why we have to do this.

24:55.085 --> 24:57.085
I-I don't want to spend
the whole weekend at Jerry Bender's.

24:57.168 --> 24:59.085
Oh, Lenny, please.
We've been through this.

24:59.168 --> 25:01.793
There are lots
of important clients there.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.793
I-- You know,
so what is this?

25:03.876 --> 25:07.168
Meanwhile this guy's going to
stare at you the whole weekend
and mentally undress you.

25:07.252 --> 25:09.168
He is not. He's not.

25:09.252 --> 25:12.751
God, your paranoia is rivaled
in history only by Joseph Stalin.

25:27.168 --> 25:29.543
I'm really glad you
could make it out this weekend, Amanda.

25:29.668 --> 25:32.127
There's some people around here I think
it's very important you should meet.

25:32.127 --> 25:35.543
Oh, thanks, Jerry.
I really appreciate it. I really do.

25:35.543 --> 25:38.127
- God, I love your sailboat.
- Yeah, it's fun, isn't it?

25:38.127 --> 25:41.043
- Yeah.
- Sorry the waves were so choppy, Lenny.

25:41.127 --> 25:44.543
Oh, it's no problem. I don't mind
throwing up into the wind, you know.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.043
You know, we could see
that house next door at 3:00.

25:47.127 --> 25:49.043
By the way, it's a great buy.

25:49.127 --> 25:51.210
Is it possible that I could
just make one quick phone call?

25:51.335 --> 25:53.210
- Yeah. Ken!
- Yes, Jerry.

25:53.335 --> 25:55.543
Oh, sorry, Ken.
Can you show Lenny the private phone?

25:55.626 --> 25:57.710
Sure. Come on, Lenny.
It's right over here.

25:57.835 --> 26:00.626
The house sounds exciting.
What are they asking again?

26:00.626 --> 26:05.002
Amanda, listen. Why don't you,
uh, spend the night here tonight.

26:05.127 --> 26:07.501
- What do you say?
Are you free tonight?
- Uh--

26:07.501 --> 26:09.501
We could go for a sail.

26:09.501 --> 26:12.501
You can't believe what the stars
look like lying on the back of a boat.

26:12.501 --> 26:15.501
- Yeah. No, I'd love to.
I really would love to.
- Well, then, do it.

26:15.585 --> 26:18.419
But I-- No, he
has to get back.

26:18.501 --> 26:21.085
Really?

26:21.210 --> 26:24.002
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

26:24.002 --> 26:26.002
Hmm.

26:28.793 --> 26:31.377
I got the skinny
on Linda Ash.

26:31.501 --> 26:35.002
She's been in a few films.
She's no star or nothin'.

26:35.002 --> 26:37.294
That's why you
never heard of her.

26:37.377 --> 26:40.793
She works under
the stage name "Judy Cum."

26:40.876 --> 26:43.168
Mostly, she's a hooker.

26:43.294 --> 26:45.377
Uh, I got her number.

26:48.168 --> 26:50.168
Judy Cum?

26:50.252 --> 26:52.168
Oh, you never should
have looked for her.

26:52.252 --> 26:54.377
Now I see big trouble.

26:54.460 --> 26:57.877
Oh, for God's sake.
You know, you're such a Cassandra.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.751
I'm not such a Cassandra.
I am Cassandra.

27:00.877 --> 27:03.335
- That's who I am.
- I gotta check this thing out.

27:03.335 --> 27:06.460
You'll be sorry.
I'm telling you, quit now.

27:06.543 --> 27:10.043
Oh, and don't let Amanda talk you
into buying the house next door.

27:10.168 --> 27:13.543
- This place?
- Yes! I see big problems
with beach erosion...

27:13.543 --> 27:15.543
and a heavy mortgage.

27:17.543 --> 27:20.751
Well, I love that property.

27:20.835 --> 27:23.419
- Mm-hmm.
- We're right near everybody.

27:23.543 --> 27:26.751
Doesn't mean we have to see them
all the time, but we have the option.

27:26.835 --> 27:29.127
You-- You're not afraid
of beach erosion, right?

27:29.210 --> 27:32.918
Beach erosion? Oh, come on, now.
You're such a Cassandra.

27:33.043 --> 27:34.918
You gonna take a shower?

27:35.043 --> 27:37.501
Yeah. Yeah, can you, uh,
fix something for dinner?

27:37.626 --> 27:39.501
Yeah, I'll make dinner.

27:39.626 --> 27:41.710
I'll make the spaghetti, okay?

27:41.835 --> 27:44.002
There's some sauce
in the fridge.

28:13.668 --> 28:16.002
Hello, is this Linda?

28:16.085 --> 28:19.377
Linda, um, this is Lenny.

28:19.377 --> 28:23.085
Uh, I-- I got your number
from Charlie Biggs.

28:23.085 --> 28:26.377
And I wonder if, uh,
it would be possible...

28:26.377 --> 28:29.377
that you would have some time
tomorrow afternoon.

28:29.461 --> 28:31.960
- You shouldn't do this.
- Would you please stop it?

28:32.085 --> 28:34.960
- You're gonna cheat on Amanda?
- I'm not cheating.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.960
-I just want to see what she looks like.
-You can get a disease.

28:37.043 --> 28:39.751
- Aren't you scared of AIDS?
- I'm not gonna sleep with the girl.

28:39.877 --> 28:41.751
I just want to see
what she looks like.

28:41.877 --> 28:44.461
I want to get to know her
or something. It's just--

28:44.461 --> 28:47.668
Uh, is it possible that we
could meet at a hotel?

28:47.751 --> 28:50.461
You're gonna rent a hotel room
with a hooker and not sleep with her?

28:50.543 --> 28:52.543
Leave me alone.
I want to talk to her.

28:52.626 --> 28:55.043
How about the Plaza
on 59th Street? Is that--

28:55.127 --> 28:59.043
What are you doing?
At least pick an out-of-the-way spot.

28:59.127 --> 29:01.043
Oh, Christ.

29:01.127 --> 29:03.835
Um, Linda, maybe
it'd be better if I--

29:03.918 --> 29:06.918
What about your place?
Would that be a possibility?

29:06.918 --> 29:09.918
- Uh-huh. Uh--

29:09.918 --> 29:11.918
Hold on one second.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.210
3:00.

29:19.835 --> 29:22.918
Okay.
Um, I'll be there.

29:23.002 --> 29:24.918
And it's Lenny.

29:26.501 --> 29:32.127
Uh, Lenny... Gildersleeve.
Okay.

29:32.210 --> 29:36.585
I can't believe this.
I can't believe it.

29:54.877 --> 29:58.085
Hi. Are you my 3:00?

30:02.668 --> 30:05.085
- Linda Ash?
- Yeah, that's right.

30:07.252 --> 30:09.960
- I'm Lenny.
- Hello, Lenny. Come on in.

30:10.085 --> 30:13.085
- Uh, you're-- you're Linda Ash, right?
- Yeah.

30:13.085 --> 30:15.169
- 'Cause we spoke on the phone?
- Yeah.

30:15.252 --> 30:17.543
Are you okay?
You look all white.

30:17.668 --> 30:19.752
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

30:19.877 --> 30:22.752
- Do you want something to drink?

30:22.835 --> 30:25.252
- Maybe-- Do you have a little
Perrier or something?
- What?

30:25.336 --> 30:28.668
- Little-- Just a little tap water?
- Oh, sure. I have that.

30:28.668 --> 30:31.626
- You're definitely Linda Ash?
- Yeah.

30:31.626 --> 30:34.252
What's the matter?
Are you a stroke victim or something?

30:34.336 --> 30:36.626
I told you three times.
I'm Linda Ash.

30:36.626 --> 30:38.626
Oh.

30:40.419 --> 30:43.752
Oh, you have a,
a beautiful apartment.

30:43.835 --> 30:47.419
- Oh, thank you. I did it myself.
- Oh.

30:47.543 --> 30:50.918
Oh, let me show you
something I just got.

30:50.918 --> 30:52.918
- That. Isn't it a pisser?
- Ohh!

30:52.918 --> 30:55.127
Oh, yes, it's--
it's magnificent.

30:55.127 --> 30:57.501
Oh. Well, yeah.
I got a great sense of humor.

30:57.626 --> 31:00.835
That's something you're going
to find out about me-- I'm funny
and I can take a joke.

31:00.835 --> 31:03.627
- A lot of people can't take a joke.
- Oh, no, I can.

31:03.710 --> 31:05.627
- They say that about me too.
- Oh, yeah?

31:05.710 --> 31:07.627
- That I have a good sense of humor.
- Oh, good!

31:07.710 --> 31:10.501
Then you'll like this. Look,
I just got this. Somebody gave it to me.

31:10.627 --> 31:14.501
As the main spring goes back and forth,
the bishop keeps fucking her in the ass.

31:14.585 --> 31:17.918
- It's a genuine antique
and it keeps perfect time.
- Oh, my goodness.

31:18.002 --> 31:20.419
It's a disgusting--
Ohh.

31:20.501 --> 31:22.377
- Lenny?

31:22.501 --> 31:25.793
The water today is a little bit brown.
Would you like some Sprite instead?

31:25.793 --> 31:28.294
- I'm feeling a little dizzy. I--
- Oh, no!

31:28.377 --> 31:30.377
- Come sit down.
- No, no. I don't know why.

31:30.501 --> 31:33.002
Usually, you know,
I'm just the picture of health.

31:33.002 --> 31:36.085
- Yeah? You work out?
- Not-- Not religiously.

31:36.085 --> 31:39.461
Oh, I'm not religious either.
Mostly, my folks were Episcopalian.

31:39.585 --> 31:41.877
- Oh, are they? So--
- So.

31:41.877 --> 31:45.085
So what do you do, Lenny?
Oh, no. Wait. Let me guess.

31:45.085 --> 31:47.668
I have a great knack for guessing
what people do for a living.

31:47.752 --> 31:50.377
- Um--
- Um, uh-- I'll tell you the truth.

31:50.461 --> 31:52.461
- Rug salesman!
- You're close.

31:52.585 --> 31:54.877
I'm-- I'm a sportswriter.
Because--

31:54.960 --> 31:56.877
- Shit. I wasn't even in the ballpark.
- Well, it was not--

31:56.960 --> 31:59.877
Wait. Ballpark. Sportswriter.
Get it?

31:59.877 --> 32:02.169
-  I get it.

32:02.252 --> 32:05.336
I did it with a wrestler once.
A huge, hairy guy.

32:05.336 --> 32:08.668
You'd figure he'd be hung like a horse,
but there was very little there.

32:08.668 --> 32:10.960
Look, could I-- could I
just get a little water?

32:11.044 --> 32:13.127
- I don't care if it's brown.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

32:13.252 --> 32:16.044
I don't mind rust.
I'm just feeling a little--

32:16.127 --> 32:19.127
T-Tell me, Linda.

32:19.252 --> 32:21.919
Uh, uh, tell me
about yourself, Linda.

32:21.919 --> 32:24.419
Well, what do you--
what do you want to know?

32:24.543 --> 32:27.127
Anything.
I just want to know about you.

32:27.211 --> 32:30.127
- Well, basically, Lenny,
- Yes?

32:30.127 --> 32:32.627
- I'm an actress.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

32:32.710 --> 32:34.710
I like drama. I study.

32:34.835 --> 32:36.710
Yes? Uh, where--
where's that?

32:36.835 --> 32:39.336
Paul Delucca.
Have you ever heard of him?

32:39.419 --> 32:41.627
- Paul Delucca? No.
But then, I wouldn't.
- Yeah.

32:41.710 --> 32:45.002
- Oh, he's really well-known.
He's a genius.
- I'm sure. I'm sure.

32:45.002 --> 32:48.211
He says he thinks I'm gonna
make it big.

32:48.294 --> 32:50.211
- Mmm.
- Um, I know you will.

32:50.294 --> 32:53.501
- Yeah. Maybe you've seen
some of my movies.
- That's possible.

32:53.585 --> 32:56.085
Did you ever see
The Enchanted Pussy?

32:56.211 --> 32:58.919
Not yet, but I-I--
It's on my list of must-see.

32:59.002 --> 33:00.877
Oh, they're videotapes,
so you can rent it.

33:01.002 --> 33:03.793
But my real ambition is
to be on Broadway in a musical.

33:03.793 --> 33:05.793
- I sing.
- Do you?

33:05.793 --> 33:07.793
- Excuse me.

33:10.793 --> 33:16.085
Hello? Busy. Some of them
are called John, all right?

33:19.461 --> 33:22.294
- Was that-- Was that your husband?
- Ha-ha. Very funny.

33:22.294 --> 33:24.793
No, but I mean, you have no husband,
no family, no children...

33:24.793 --> 33:27.377
or anything like that?

33:27.461 --> 33:30.377
'Cause some do.
You have a funny look on your face.

33:30.461 --> 33:32.377
- Um.
- Did I say the wrong thing?

33:32.461 --> 33:34.668
- No. Not really.
- I-- I said--

33:34.752 --> 33:36.960
No. No, listen.

33:37.044 --> 33:39.668
- What are you in the mood for, Len?
- Me? I-I, well,

33:39.752 --> 33:41.960
I would like to--
You know, we can chat for a while.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.169
I thought I'd get into it
slowly and, you know--

33:44.252 --> 33:46.461
You're married, aren't you?

33:46.543 --> 33:49.461
- How can you tell that?
- 'Cause you got that look.

33:49.543 --> 33:51.461
That look?
Wh-What look is that?

33:51.543 --> 33:54.543
That look like it's been a long time
since you've had a great blow job.

33:54.627 --> 33:58.336
Oh, that look.
I-- I can understand.

33:58.336 --> 34:01.627
- Wh-Where are you from?
- Mm, around.

34:01.752 --> 34:04.044
What are you so interested
in me for?

34:04.127 --> 34:06.543
- That's my fingers.
- Yes, I know.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.543
- Here.
- What--

34:08.627 --> 34:10.543
Pull, pull!
Pull the strings.

34:10.627 --> 34:13.044
- Pull these strings?
- Yeah, pull all the strings.
See? See what happens?

34:13.127 --> 34:15.710
- I'm not so mechanical as I was.
- Oh, it's easy. Here. Pull.

34:15.835 --> 34:18.710
- Ahh! See, it opens!
- Ohh!

34:18.835 --> 34:21.002
That's amazing.
Science is-- is--

34:21.002 --> 34:23.794
- Yeah.
- You, you, you-- I-I--

34:23.794 --> 34:26.794
Oh. Really. Well.

34:26.919 --> 34:30.794
Uh, you're a very attractive woman,
a very beautiful young woman.

34:30.919 --> 34:32.794
Oh, thank you, Lenny.

34:32.919 --> 34:35.794
Well, you're cute too.
So, what do you say?

34:35.919 --> 34:38.294
- You wanna go inside, take a shower?
- A shower?

34:38.419 --> 34:41.002
-You can study me up close and personal.
-Oh! Oh.

34:41.086 --> 34:43.502
No, see, I bathed already.

34:43.585 --> 34:45.502
- You got lipstick on my fi--

34:45.585 --> 34:47.794
- Mmm, you smell clean. Mmm.
- Thank you. Well--

34:47.877 --> 34:51.377
As I say, I'm basically--
My ear.

34:51.377 --> 34:53.877
- You're sensitive, huh?
- It's my weak spot, in my ear.

34:53.877 --> 34:56.502
- Oh. Okay.

34:56.502 --> 34:59.169
A little nibbling
makes me... go crazy.

34:59.294 --> 35:01.585
Okay, Len.
Are you nervous?

35:01.585 --> 35:04.668
I-- No. But yes, I am nervous,
to tell you the truth.

35:04.794 --> 35:07.461
- You do look that way.
- I've never-- I-I've never
done this, actually.

35:07.461 --> 35:10.169
- Oh, okay. That's all right.
I'll take it slow.
- This is-- I-I--

35:10.252 --> 35:12.169
Oh. Okay. I--

35:12.252 --> 35:14.378
Um, incidentally, Len,

35:14.461 --> 35:17.461
I think I should tell you
ahead of time I-I get 200 dollars.

35:17.543 --> 35:19.752
It's no problem.
No problem.

35:19.752 --> 35:22.252
- Just a-- Just a show of good faith.
- Thanks, Lenny. Wow!

35:22.336 --> 35:24.252
You're really sweet, Len.

35:24.336 --> 35:26.461
Put it down
as a religious contribution.

35:26.461 --> 35:29.835
No, but seriously, you want to know
why I liked you right from the start?

35:29.960 --> 35:33.336
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm always attracted to losers.

35:33.461 --> 35:35.543
Losers?
You think I'm a loser?

35:35.627 --> 35:37.752
Yeah.
You got no confidence.

35:37.835 --> 35:39.752
It's sweet.
I like that in a man.

35:39.835 --> 35:43.419
I can't stand those johns who come here
and throw down a couple of hundred...

35:43.543 --> 35:46.127
and whip out a big dick
and wave it all over the joint.

35:46.252 --> 35:49.919
Oh, I-- I wouldn't do that
even if I wanted to because I'll just--

35:50.044 --> 35:52.710
- Ah, shit!

35:52.710 --> 35:55.710
Hello. Oh, hello,
Angela.

35:55.835 --> 35:59.919
Oh! Oh, wow!
Ha-ha!

35:59.919 --> 36:03.127
Oh, God, thank you
for thinking of me.

36:03.211 --> 36:05.127
Yeah, that's great.

36:05.211 --> 36:08.919
Okay.
Yeah, well, I'll see you at 10:00.

36:08.919 --> 36:11.002
Bye.

36:11.127 --> 36:14.419
I just got a small part
in an Angela Dawson movie.

36:14.419 --> 36:16.919
I get to do it with her!

36:19.002 --> 36:20.877
I don't understand you.

36:21.002 --> 36:23.502
If you're-- If you're serious
about being a Broadway actress,

36:23.585 --> 36:25.877
what are you wasting your time
with all this porn for?

36:26.002 --> 36:28.378
What's it to you?
It's good experience.

36:28.502 --> 36:31.378
How? Making it with a woman in front
of the camera is good experience?

36:31.502 --> 36:33.877
That's gonna get you closer
to be a Broadway star?

36:34.002 --> 36:36.378
- What are you getting all mad for?
- I'm not mad.

36:36.502 --> 36:39.461
I just think it's crazy.
You're an attractive young woman.

36:39.585 --> 36:41.961
You know, what are you--
You don't have to live like this, Linda.

36:42.086 --> 36:43.961
- What are you, my pastor?
- This is crazy!

36:44.086 --> 36:46.669
You take money from guys
and you perform all these acts.

36:46.752 --> 36:49.378
You know, you could be--
Hey, I'm talking to you.

36:49.461 --> 36:51.752
- You could have a family.
- Hey, let go of me!

36:51.877 --> 36:55.252
- You could have a husband
and a child or something.
- All right. No. Hey!

36:55.378 --> 36:57.543
Stop. Stop it now! Stop!

36:57.543 --> 37:00.044
- Listen. I don't like possessive men.
- I'm not possessive.

37:00.044 --> 37:02.336
You come in here, you don't
want to do anything with me.
You're telling me what to do.

37:02.336 --> 37:04.336
- I want to talk.
- Do you want to do it or not?

37:04.336 --> 37:06.669
- I want to talk.
I paid you, I want to talk.
- Oh, no. Okay.

37:06.752 --> 37:08.669
- I bought the time.
- Then you get your money back.

37:08.752 --> 37:10.835
- I'm giving it back. Refund.
- No, keep the money.

37:10.835 --> 37:12.835
- Let's go. No.
- I bought the time!

37:12.835 --> 37:16.127
- Hey, stop it. No, I'm giving
it back and you're leaving.
- Why can't I talk?

37:16.253 --> 37:18.127
- Get out!

37:28.211 --> 37:31.543
Daddy, why are you
staring at me like that?

37:31.543 --> 37:33.627
Come here.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.710
You know why I'm
staring at you?

37:35.835 --> 37:38.336
I'm staring at you
'cause I can't believe it.

37:38.419 --> 37:40.835
Because you're so bright
and you're such a great kid.

37:40.919 --> 37:43.627
Come on, Max.
Now it's time for bed.

37:43.627 --> 37:46.919
Come on. Okay.
Time for beddums.

37:47.002 --> 37:49.710
- Ready? The kid's getting heavy.

37:49.710 --> 37:52.710
- He can walk, you know.
- Yeah. Okay. Can you walk?

37:52.794 --> 37:55.710
Poor Weinrib! Turn back.

37:55.794 --> 37:59.502
Don't meddle any further.
Accept the truth.

37:59.585 --> 38:02.502
I see disaster.
I see catastrophe.

38:02.585 --> 38:05.294
Worse, I see lawyers.

38:05.294 --> 38:07.794
But wait, a messenger.

38:09.294 --> 38:12.002
I come from the midtown area
where Lenny Weinrib,

38:12.002 --> 38:14.669
tortured by passions
too overwhelming to regulate,

38:14.794 --> 38:17.169
did indeed call
this little hustler on the phone...

38:17.294 --> 38:19.794
in earnest attempt
to see her again.

38:19.877 --> 38:21.961
At first he wrestled
with his drives,

38:22.086 --> 38:23.961
trying to master a curiosity...

38:24.086 --> 38:27.461
not slaked by this initial meeting,
but only whetted by it.

38:27.461 --> 38:32.169
His thirst to know this woman more
did inexorably provoke him to call her.

38:32.253 --> 38:35.544
Nervous and confused, at first
he only got her answering machine.

38:35.544 --> 38:38.752
Then, at fifth try,
she picked up the phone herself.

38:38.877 --> 38:43.169
Painful to relate that she
thought he was nuts and did
not want to meet him nohow.

38:43.169 --> 38:46.836
"Stop bothering me, creep,"
was her cutting declaration.

38:46.961 --> 38:49.044
Then she used the "F" word.

38:49.169 --> 38:52.627
Agonized, he called again, offering
her abundant financial compensation...

38:52.752 --> 38:54.961
just for a brief chat.

38:54.961 --> 38:58.127
But she bade him get off her back
and slammed the phone down.

38:58.253 --> 39:02.253
Finally, in doldrums mixed
with much anxiety,

39:02.336 --> 39:04.253
he stood watch
outside her apartment...

39:04.336 --> 39:08.710
and waited until such a time as he did
spot her heading for the laundromat.

39:18.502 --> 39:21.211
- Oh, my God!
- Okay, don't get upset or anything.

39:21.336 --> 39:23.294
- I just thought we could have lunch.
- Why me?

39:23.419 --> 39:26.128
- I'll pay for your time.
I just want to speak to you.
- All right!

39:26.128 --> 39:29.128
What are you, some kind
of fucking pervert who--

39:29.128 --> 39:31.919
Leave me alone. I'm not--
I'm not one of those psychopaths...

39:32.002 --> 39:33.919
that kills prostitutes,
I promise you.

39:34.002 --> 39:37.294
- Why would you ever say
something like that?
- I'm joking. I'm joking.

39:37.419 --> 39:41.502
Listen, in my work, I have to keep
an eye out for strange individuals.

39:41.585 --> 39:43.710
- Okay.
- I knew a girl that got killed.

39:43.794 --> 39:46.002
All right. Hey,
I got you some flowers. Here.

39:46.086 --> 39:49.002
I got you some flowers.
Let's have lunch. I'll pay for it.

39:49.086 --> 39:52.585
I'll pay for your time.
I just wanna talk to you.

39:53.794 --> 39:56.502
So then my mother married
my third father.

39:56.502 --> 39:58.877
I mean, I don't know if she
married him, but he moved in.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.669
We didn't get along.
He was a disgusting drunk.

40:01.794 --> 40:04.877
What about your hereditary
father? Your actual, actual--

40:04.877 --> 40:08.585
Oh, he was a drug pusher
and he was also a car thief.

40:08.669 --> 40:11.752
He picked pockets and, you know,
he burgled and stuff.

40:11.877 --> 40:15.378
- And he was an epileptic.
- Uh-huh. You haven't left
anything out, right?

40:15.461 --> 40:18.169
- Mail fraud!
- Oh, mail fraud. Oh, okay, yeah.

40:18.253 --> 40:20.169
- That's what they caught him on.
- Uh-huh.

40:20.253 --> 40:22.669
Hey, you got an appetite
like a lumberjack.

40:22.752 --> 40:24.669
Oh. Well, thank you.

40:24.752 --> 40:26.669
Oh, it's fine.
Eat all you want.

40:26.752 --> 40:30.961
I'm very hungry, actually.
Um, so then I ran away when I was 14.

40:30.961 --> 40:32.461
Mm-hmm.

40:32.461 --> 40:35.044
And I went away with
this musician named Johnny.

40:35.128 --> 40:38.044
And it was terrible because
we fought all the time, Lenny.

40:38.044 --> 40:40.336
Finally,
he committed suicide.

40:40.420 --> 40:42.627
And for years I thought it
was because of my cooking.

40:42.752 --> 40:44.752
He always hated my clam sauce.

40:44.752 --> 40:48.336
And so then I kicked around
from Chicago, Philadelphia, you know.

40:48.420 --> 40:50.336
All over the place.
And I ended up here.

40:50.420 --> 40:52.711
You never thought of
just getting a regular job?

40:52.711 --> 40:54.711
Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.
No, I did things.

40:54.836 --> 40:58.711
I waited on tables. I worked
in a massage parlor. I did phone sex.

40:58.711 --> 41:02.128
Now and then I would, you know, turn a
few tricks in order to make some dough.

41:02.211 --> 41:05.794
And one day my friend Susie calls me and
she asks me if I want to be in a film.

41:05.919 --> 41:08.627
Something called Snatch Happy.
And I said, "Sure."

41:08.711 --> 41:11.294
And I remember
I was very nervous...

41:11.420 --> 41:14.711
because I'd never done it in front of
people with a camera before, you know.

41:14.794 --> 41:17.919
And so there I am on the first day,
on the set.

41:18.002 --> 41:20.585
And there's this guy
fucking me from behind, right?

41:20.711 --> 41:24.378
And there's these two huge guys dressed
like cops in my mouth at the same time.

41:24.378 --> 41:26.585
And I remember
thinking to myself,

41:26.711 --> 41:29.502
"I like acting. I wanna study."

41:30.585 --> 41:33.794
Yes, well.
It's a-- It's a--

41:33.877 --> 41:36.877
That's one way
of getting into the profession.

41:36.961 --> 41:38.961
Um, tell me about
your family a little bit.

41:38.961 --> 41:41.461
What? I told you already.
You could write a book by now.

41:41.585 --> 41:43.585
But, but were there
any unusual members?

41:43.669 --> 41:46.961
- Very bright ones or brilliant
or talented or something.
- Mmm! Yes!

41:46.961 --> 41:48.961
- I'm sorry. There was.
- Mmm.

41:49.086 --> 41:51.086
My father's brother
was supposed to be a genius.

41:51.169 --> 41:53.253
I never met him, but everybody
said he was brilliant.

41:53.378 --> 41:57.044
- Really? What did he do?
- He was a serial rapist.
He spent his whole life in jail.

41:57.169 --> 42:00.044
But if he had gone straight,
he might have been very good in math.

42:00.169 --> 42:02.253
- Good in math. Well, that's--
- Yeah.

42:02.253 --> 42:04.253
I think I got
my intelligence from him,

42:04.253 --> 42:06.544
because everybody else in the family
is all slugs and lowlifes.

42:06.669 --> 42:09.044
- I'm the only one with any ambition.
- Are you?

42:09.169 --> 42:11.544
And you never-- never
had a drive to get married?

42:11.627 --> 42:13.544
What for?
They're all assholes.

42:13.627 --> 42:15.544
One of them used to
beat me up.

42:15.627 --> 42:18.544
Another one used to fuck
my best friend when I wasn't looking.

42:18.627 --> 42:21.044
- It was sickening.
- Really.

42:21.044 --> 42:23.752
And-- And let me
ask you this.

42:23.836 --> 42:26.836
At any point in your life
did you ever think, like,

42:26.919 --> 42:29.336
"Maybe I'd like
to have a child"?

42:33.211 --> 42:35.627
Um, I-l did have
a child once.

42:35.711 --> 42:38.211
- Did you?
- Ah, it was a sad story.

42:38.336 --> 42:40.502
I'll tell you some other time
when I know you better.

42:40.627 --> 42:42.919
If I ever know you better.

42:44.919 --> 42:46.919
Are you free this afternoon?

42:46.919 --> 42:49.211
- Why?
- You have some free time
this afternoon?

42:49.295 --> 42:51.502
- Are you finally in the mood, Lenny?
- No, no, no, no, no.

42:51.586 --> 42:53.711
I wanna--
I have an assignment.

42:53.711 --> 42:56.711
But I thought you might wanna come
with me, 'cause I think you'll enjoy it.

43:03.086 --> 43:06.586
I'm gonna bet on a horse,
and if it wins you can keep the dough.

43:06.586 --> 43:09.295
Here's one. "Eager Beaver."

43:09.295 --> 43:11.295
I once did a film
called Beaver Patrol...

43:11.295 --> 43:14.003
about these Boy Scouts who find
drunk Girl Scouts in the woods.

43:14.003 --> 43:17.586
And they take them into a cabin
and they reach into their packs
and they pull out these dildos.

43:17.586 --> 43:19.961
- And then--
- All right, all right. Okay, we'll--

43:20.086 --> 43:21.961
Y-You're sure you want
to bet on Eager Beaver?

43:22.086 --> 43:24.169
- 'Cause it's a 60-to-1.
- Oh, yeah. No, I know it's the one. No!

43:24.295 --> 43:26.461
- But it's 60-to-1.
- It's a sign. I know it's gonna work.

43:26.586 --> 43:28.586
All right, all right.
Famous last words.

43:28.669 --> 43:30.669
- You know.
- I got a hunch.

43:30.752 --> 43:32.961
- You got a hunch. Okay.
Sure, we'll bet on it.
- Yeah.

43:33.044 --> 43:35.461
Okay. So if he wins,
how much do I make?

43:35.544 --> 43:38.752
At 60-to-1?
Uh... you make, uh, $3,000.

43:38.752 --> 43:41.961
Oh, my God! I could get that blue
chinchilla coat that I wanted!

43:42.044 --> 43:43.961
- You could get anything you want.
- I could get a Jacuzzi.

43:44.044 --> 43:47.169
- Except he's not gonna win.
- Oh, no, I know what I could do, Lenny!

43:47.253 --> 43:49.461
- Oh, my God! This is great.
- Mm-hmm.

43:49.544 --> 43:51.836
All right. You know,
I hope-- I hope you're right.

43:51.961 --> 43:54.961
There's a reason the horse is 60-to-1,
though. He's probably got polio.

43:55.044 --> 43:57.627
Oh, no, no. No.
This is a sign.

43:57.752 --> 43:59.836
- All right.
- My luck is gonna change.

43:59.836 --> 44:03.253
- So is your real name Linda?
Is that your actual name?
- I use a lot of names.

44:03.336 --> 44:07.128
My born name is Leslie, but I like
to use names that have nice meanings.

44:07.211 --> 44:09.128
You know, like Mary,
for the Virgin Mary.

44:09.211 --> 44:11.711
Or Angel or Linda,
which means "pretty" in Spanish.

44:11.836 --> 44:14.711
- But my screen name's Judy Cum.
- Mm-hmm.

44:14.836 --> 44:17.211
Well, lucky there's not a horse
with that name in the race...

44:17.336 --> 44:19.211
- 'cause we'd bet on him.
- Oh, no, no, no.

44:19.336 --> 44:21.627
I mean, my attorney friend
would take that under advisement.

44:21.627 --> 44:23.919
- Mm-hmm.
- I got exclusive rights to that name.

44:24.003 --> 44:26.128
All right, all right,
all right. Yeah.

44:26.128 --> 44:28.128
So let me ask you
a question.

44:28.128 --> 44:30.919
Are you ever frightened that when a guy
comes over your house and pays you...

44:31.003 --> 44:33.919
that he's gonna maybe,
like tie you up and kill you?

44:34.003 --> 44:36.420
Oh, no. I always
get paid in advance.

44:36.502 --> 44:39.211
- Come on.

44:39.295 --> 44:41.502
- Eager Beaver. He's paying.
- Paid in advance? That's--

44:41.586 --> 44:43.502
Lenny.

44:43.586 --> 44:45.502
-  They're
coming down to the finish.
-  Come on, Beaver!

44:45.586 --> 44:47.794
- It's Autumn Daisy and Enmity.
- Come on! Catch up!

44:47.794 --> 44:50.086
- Eager Beaver continues to drop back.
- Oh, shit! Oh, Beaver!

44:50.170 --> 44:53.170
- Autumn Daisy and Enmity. It's close.
- Beaver! Come on, Beaver!

44:53.295 --> 44:55.669
- Oh! Beaver!
- It's Autumn Daisy by a head.

44:55.669 --> 44:57.878
- Shit! Last?
- Enmity finishing second...

44:57.878 --> 45:00.086
- and Lower The Flag finishing third,
- Stupid horse got-- Damn it!

45:00.170 --> 45:03.295
- followed by Marcy's Pride,
True Blue Crew, Classic Alert,
- I had it spent already!

45:03.295 --> 45:05.586
- I know. Relax, relax. Relax, will ya?
- and Eager Beaver was last.

45:05.669 --> 45:08.669
You know, it's not so terrible.
I told you it was a long shot.

45:08.669 --> 45:10.878
- I never have any luck. Never!
- All right.

45:10.961 --> 45:13.378
I never won a fucking thing
in my entire life! Nothing! Never!

45:13.462 --> 45:16.961
Will you stay calm?
You gotta learn to be a graceful loser.

45:17.044 --> 45:20.170
If it's the money,
I'll lend you the money.

45:20.170 --> 45:22.170
- I can help you.
- No, it's not the money, Lenny.

45:22.170 --> 45:25.462
I don't care about the money.
I just wanted to win so badly.

45:25.544 --> 45:28.669
What do you want to win for?
We're just out here having a good time.

45:28.753 --> 45:30.961
- You gotta--
- 'Cause I wanted to impress you.

45:31.044 --> 45:34.336
Impress me? What? You know,
you're not running in the race.

45:34.462 --> 45:36.627
What-- You don't
have to impress me. I'm--

45:36.753 --> 45:39.253
Yeah, but I wanted to show you
I could pick a winner.

45:39.336 --> 45:42.836
Hey. Listen, my horse
didn't win either, you know.

45:42.919 --> 45:44.836
Come on, you--
you do impress me.

45:44.919 --> 45:48.544
You're attractive, you're--
you're quick, you have a lot of energy.

45:48.627 --> 45:51.044
- You're obviously
a state-of-the-art fellatrix.
- What?

45:51.128 --> 45:53.836
So-- Nothing, nothing.
I'm impressed. Take--

45:53.919 --> 45:55.836
- Lenny, don't say "nothing."
- I'm impressed.

45:55.919 --> 45:58.336
- You think I'm stupid?
- I don't think you're stupid, no.

45:58.336 --> 46:00.836
- No?
- You know, I think you do
a stupid thing with your life.

46:00.836 --> 46:02.836
But I told you that already.

46:02.836 --> 46:05.295
Well, I don't understand
why it matters so much to you.

46:05.295 --> 46:08.502
Hey, come on. We'll stay for one more
race, and this time I'll bet for you.

46:08.627 --> 46:10.711
- Yeah?
- Let me make the bet.
Yeah. N-No. Come on.

46:10.794 --> 46:12.794
- We'll just go to the window
and I'll make one bet.
- All right.

46:12.919 --> 46:15.003
Please don't pick one
that runs second...

46:15.003 --> 46:17.003
- 'cause I want a winner, okay, Len?
- Yeah. Hey.

46:17.086 --> 46:20.502
You know, they give these horses saliva
tests. I can't guarantee anything.

46:24.086 --> 46:26.794
- I gave you your winnings, right?
- Yeah.

46:26.878 --> 46:30.586
That was a great race.
Too bad the horse only paid 40 cents.

46:30.669 --> 46:33.586
Well, he was a heavy favorite, you know,
and I bet him to come in third.

46:33.669 --> 46:36.586
- At least this way you get something.
- Yeah.

46:36.586 --> 46:38.586
So, you wanna come in?

46:38.586 --> 46:41.794
I gotta go home.
I got a wife and kid. You know, I can't.

46:41.878 --> 46:45.878
You know, you only talk about me.
You never talk about yourself.

46:45.961 --> 46:49.378
It's late for me. You know,
I had a great time, but I gotta go.

46:49.462 --> 46:51.669
I feel I owe you a great fuck.

46:51.753 --> 46:55.753
Hey, do me a favor. Go upstairs,
rest your ulcer, stay in tonight.

46:55.878 --> 46:58.462
I can't stay in.
I got six dates.

46:58.544 --> 47:00.544
Six dates.
Slow night for you, right?

47:00.669 --> 47:04.836
I wish I had the penicillin concession
in your apartment. I'd-- I'd be wealthy.

47:04.836 --> 47:07.544
All right.
So, you're gonna call me again?

47:07.669 --> 47:10.253
Am I gonna call you again?
Yeah, I'll call you. Don't worry.

47:10.253 --> 47:12.544
- You promise?
- I will. I'll call you again.

47:12.627 --> 47:14.836
Okay. I had a great time.

47:14.836 --> 47:16.836
- Bye.
- Okay.

47:16.836 --> 47:18.836
Whew.

47:31.045 --> 47:33.337
- Congratulations.
- Thirty-five years.

47:33.420 --> 47:35.337
- I never thought we'd make it.
- You and Amanda...

47:35.420 --> 47:37.337
have a way to go,
but you'll make it.

47:37.420 --> 47:39.502
- You guys look so young, both of you.
- Yeah, you do.

47:39.628 --> 47:41.502
Well, we've kept
each other young.

47:41.628 --> 47:44.211
Your mother could be your sister,
and you could be brother and sister.

47:44.295 --> 47:47.211
- You could be my-- yes.
- I don't know where that
puts me, but anyway--

47:51.086 --> 47:53.586
She looks so beautiful,
doesn't she, Lenny?

47:53.711 --> 47:55.794
- To me, she always looks beautiful.
- Mmm.

47:55.919 --> 47:57.794
-I just always find her great. And you--

47:57.919 --> 48:00.794
When I said sisters before, I mean it.
You guys look so great.

48:00.878 --> 48:03.378
And it's a wonder,
with all the responsibility...

48:03.502 --> 48:05.794
she has opening
her new gallery.

48:05.878 --> 48:08.502
- It's a lot of work.
- What new gallery? A new gallery?

48:08.502 --> 48:11.170
No, I didn't tell you 'cause,
you know, I don't know until
it's a hundred percent definite.

48:11.170 --> 48:13.502
- Well, did I say the wrong thing?
- But it's not.

48:13.586 --> 48:16.170
- No, sure. No, I just--
- It's a hundred percent definite.

48:16.170 --> 48:18.295
You're so insecure.
It's happening.

48:18.295 --> 48:21.794
- Oh, excuse me.

48:21.878 --> 48:24.295
- What is the story on this?
- It looks like I have the backing,

48:24.378 --> 48:26.253
but it's not totally definite.

48:26.378 --> 48:28.253
- That's why I didn't say anything.
- Your mother said it was definite.

48:28.378 --> 48:30.462
Yeah, well. It seems as if
I do have the backing.

48:30.586 --> 48:33.170
And there is this wonderful space
on Vesey Street. You know it?

48:33.253 --> 48:35.462
- Vesey? Yeah, I know it.
- Yeah, down in Soho.

48:35.544 --> 48:38.961
And it looks like, you know,
we think we can get it.

48:39.045 --> 48:41.961
The Dorians are putting in
some money, but I--

48:41.961 --> 48:43.961
- Well, don't look so happy about it.
- I am happy!

48:43.961 --> 48:47.253
I'm very happy for you, but it's
the first I'm hearing of it, you know.

48:47.253 --> 48:49.753
- And for your mother to tell me--
- Yeah, well, look.

48:49.753 --> 48:52.337
I realize that for a time I'm going
to be busier than usual...

48:52.462 --> 48:54.753
and I know that's
a sore point,

48:54.753 --> 48:57.753
but, you know, it'll be only
'til it gets off the ground.

48:57.753 --> 49:00.253
- Hey, I'm happy for you. I re--
- You are?

49:00.253 --> 49:02.544
- Yes. I just would have
liked to have known it.
- Are you sure?

49:02.628 --> 49:05.420
- The Amanda Sloane Gallery.
I think that it's great.
- Yeah, on Vesey Street.

49:05.544 --> 49:08.920
Believe me.
I haven't even told Jerry Bender yet.

49:09.045 --> 49:12.420
"You've got a fine right, you have,
after the way you treated Mother,

49:12.544 --> 49:14.711
"after the way you treated us all!

49:14.836 --> 49:18.128
"A fine right you've got to come back
in here in your best country manner...

49:18.212 --> 49:21.836
"and strike attitudes
and make stands...

49:21.920 --> 49:24.628
"and criticize my fiance
and give orders...

49:24.628 --> 49:26.920
"and mess things up generally
as if you'd done--

49:26.920 --> 49:28.920
"Well, I can't help it.
It's sickening!

49:29.003 --> 49:31.920
As if he'd done nothing at all!"

49:34.920 --> 49:36.920
Well?

49:37.003 --> 49:38.920
What do you think?

49:39.003 --> 49:41.794
- About what?
- About me.

49:41.794 --> 49:45.003
- You think I'm any good?
- Yes, it's fine.

49:45.003 --> 49:47.003
I-- You know, you're asking
the wrong person.

49:47.003 --> 49:49.003
I don't know that much about acting,
to tell you the truth.

49:49.086 --> 49:51.003
Oh, I can tell
you're not too impressed.

49:51.086 --> 49:54.378
No, no, no. I just thought, you know,
it's a very odd part for you to choose.

49:54.378 --> 49:57.378
- Why?
- Well, you know, 'cause
it's The Philadelphia Story.

49:57.378 --> 50:00.462
- But I lived in Philadelphia.
- What has that got to do with it?

50:00.462 --> 50:04.878
- I know the city.
- What? You pick a part like this--

50:04.961 --> 50:08.378
You should get something
closer to yourself.
It wouldn't be such a struggle.

50:08.378 --> 50:10.462
- You know.
- Well, what part should I play?

50:10.586 --> 50:13.045
You know-- I don't know.
Something closer.

50:13.045 --> 50:15.669
Clint Eastwood doesn't play
a meek little hairdresser.

50:15.753 --> 50:18.045
Well, I could play
a hairdresser.

50:18.045 --> 50:20.378
I-I used to--
I used to do it a lot.

50:20.462 --> 50:22.337
I wanted to be one.
I was very good at it.

50:22.462 --> 50:25.045
- So why'd you give it up?
- Well, I don't know.

50:25.045 --> 50:27.045
One thing led to another.

50:27.045 --> 50:29.170
You know, my aunt worked
in a beauty parlor for years.

50:29.170 --> 50:31.753
She loved it.

50:31.836 --> 50:34.753
Wait. You mean
not be an actress?

50:34.836 --> 50:37.628
Well, an actress
is a very tough life, you know.

50:37.628 --> 50:40.420
- But a hairdresser
could always make a buck.
- A buck?

50:40.544 --> 50:43.337
A buck! An honest buck.
No beatings, no AIDS.

50:43.420 --> 50:45.337
You can meet somebody
that you, you know--

50:45.420 --> 50:48.711
You can get a family, have a real life,
someone that cares for you.

50:48.711 --> 50:50.711
Hey!

50:50.711 --> 50:53.337
Now, don't you think that I want
to meet somebody and get married...

50:53.420 --> 50:55.711
and get the hell
out of the rat race?

50:55.711 --> 50:58.836
I would like to move away
and become a mother and just raise kids.

50:58.920 --> 51:00.836
I don't even want
to be a hairdresser.

51:00.920 --> 51:03.295
If Clint Eastwood wants
to be a hairdresser, just let him.

51:03.295 --> 51:07.295
You missed the point. Clint Eastwood
doesn't want to be a hairdresser.

51:07.295 --> 51:09.920
I had a kid, Lenny,

51:09.920 --> 51:12.420
and I gave him up
for adoption.

51:13.920 --> 51:18.420
It's the sorriest thing
I ever did in my entire life.

51:19.795 --> 51:22.878
There's not a day
that doesn't go by that I don't...

51:23.003 --> 51:25.878
wake up thinking
about him.

51:26.003 --> 51:28.295
Now some lucky family
has him.

51:28.378 --> 51:31.795
I just hope to God that they're
taking good care of him.

51:33.295 --> 51:35.961
Why'd you give him up?

51:35.961 --> 51:38.795
I don't know. I was--
I was all confused.

51:38.878 --> 51:42.087
I had no dough. I-I--
I didn't know what to do.

51:42.087 --> 51:44.170
I--

51:44.253 --> 51:46.170
I didn't even know
who the father was.

51:46.253 --> 51:48.961
It could've been any one
of a hundred guys.

51:49.087 --> 51:51.961
Welcome to planet Earth,
thanks to a broken condom.

51:54.379 --> 51:58.253
Gee. That's tough.

52:00.170 --> 52:02.045
Um.

52:03.253 --> 52:05.753
What about your kid?

52:05.836 --> 52:08.961
Max? M-M-Ma-- You know.
Max is the greatest.

52:09.045 --> 52:11.253
- Yeah?
- Well, sure.

52:11.253 --> 52:13.961
Do you have
a picture of him?

52:14.045 --> 52:17.753
- A picture of Max?
- Yeah. I'd like to see him.

52:17.753 --> 52:19.753
Oh.

52:19.753 --> 52:22.253
Uh, yeah, I guess I--

52:29.628 --> 52:32.628
Oh.

52:34.711 --> 52:38.212
He's very sweet. He--

52:38.337 --> 52:40.212
You're very lucky.

52:40.337 --> 52:42.337
With Amanda, it was fate.

52:42.337 --> 52:44.420
With Linda, it's hubris.

52:44.503 --> 52:49.003
His drive to find out, and now,
to change her life, to control her.

52:49.003 --> 52:51.003
-  Yes.
-  Danger.

52:51.087 --> 52:54.503
Wait. Wait,
I see... danger.

52:54.586 --> 52:58.212
Hey, wait a minute. I don't have
any interest in controlling her.

52:58.295 --> 53:00.295
I'm doing this for Max's sake.

53:00.379 --> 53:04.087
When the kid gets older, inevitably
he's gonna trace his mother.

53:04.212 --> 53:06.379
And, you know, I'd be happier...

53:06.503 --> 53:09.795
if she was married and a--
a hairdresser, you know,

53:09.878 --> 53:12.795
rather than the star
of The Enchanted Pussy.

53:12.878 --> 53:16.878
Danger! I see horrible,
horrible danger!

53:16.878 --> 53:20.670
- Terrible danger!
- Hey, I can handle myself emotionally.

53:20.670 --> 53:24.253
Not emotional danger,
physical danger.

53:24.253 --> 53:27.670
I see a bald man.
He has a lead pipe.

53:27.753 --> 53:30.170
He's breaking your kneecaps.

53:36.544 --> 53:39.170
So, so, uh, what did, uh--
How did Jerry Bender take it...

53:39.253 --> 53:41.753
when you said that
the decision was final?

53:41.836 --> 53:43.836
You know what?
He was amazing.

53:43.962 --> 53:47.962
I thought he'd be upset, but no,
he was very excited and very supportive.

53:48.045 --> 53:50.962
No, he's being--
He was absolutely great about it.

53:50.962 --> 53:53.962
Anyway, I-l'm calling to say
I can't make dinner tonight.

53:54.045 --> 53:55.962
Oh, you're kidding.
It's gonna be great.

53:55.962 --> 54:00.128
Everybody in the Madison Square Garden
organization's gonna be there.

54:00.254 --> 54:02.128
Look, there's no way
I can get away.

54:02.254 --> 54:05.254
The architects are here
and the Dorians are in town from Paris.

54:05.337 --> 54:09.212
And, uh, the architects fly back
to Milan tonight. I can't.

54:09.212 --> 54:12.544
All right, well.
I'll tell you what.

54:12.628 --> 54:15.212
What I'll do is, I'll go home
and I'll put Max to sleep.

54:15.212 --> 54:17.337
I'll spend a little time
there and then--

54:17.337 --> 54:19.628
Then-- Oh.

54:19.711 --> 54:22.628
Uh, look, let me--
I'm gonna call you back. I got, uh--

54:22.711 --> 54:25.128
I'm gonna call you back.
Oh, geez.

54:25.128 --> 54:27.128
It's just against our policy--
-  I understand!

54:27.128 --> 54:29.128
- If you wanna wait right here.
- Whatever.

54:29.128 --> 54:31.087
-Lenny, there's someone here to see you.
-Lenny!

54:31.087 --> 54:33.711
-  Uh, yes.
Uh, c-c-come in. Come in.
- Lenny!

54:33.711 --> 54:36.295
- Th-This is Miss Gildersleeve.
She's an acquaintance.
- You know her?

54:36.420 --> 54:38.795
- Gildersleeve?
- Yes, Miss-- Miss Gildersleeve.

54:38.920 --> 54:41.878
We're old-- It's okay. It's okay.
I'll be in here.

54:42.003 --> 54:44.503
- You don't need anything?
- No, no! I'm fine.

54:44.503 --> 54:46.503
- Okay.
- I'm fine.

54:46.503 --> 54:49.087
- What are you doing here?
- Lenny? Lenny, I got to talk to you.

54:49.170 --> 54:51.503
Ricky threatened to-- to--
to hurt me. He--

54:51.586 --> 54:55.170
- Who's Ricky?
- He takes a percentage of my work.

54:55.295 --> 54:58.795
- He's a pimp, right?
- No, he's like
a business representative.

54:58.878 --> 55:01.087
What do you need a business repre--
You-- You--

55:01.087 --> 55:04.379
All you need is a mattress
and a couple of garter belts.
You're not a conglomerate.

55:04.462 --> 55:06.670
Lenny, he said he
was going to cut me up...

55:06.753 --> 55:09.170
because I told him I didn't
want to work anymore.

55:09.254 --> 55:12.878
Well, I think it's a great
idea that you want to phase out.

55:12.962 --> 55:14.962
- He has no qualms about killing me.
- Ohh.

55:15.045 --> 55:17.254
Listen, we'll call the police.
That's not a big deal.

55:17.254 --> 55:19.878
How can I call the police
with my setup?

55:19.962 --> 55:22.670
You know, I told you
a thousand times...

55:22.753 --> 55:24.753
you're in a hazardous business.

55:24.837 --> 55:27.254
So that's what happens.
Now, so-- Don't go outside.

55:27.254 --> 55:30.462
I'm not going outside. I thought,
just maybe, if you could talk to him.

55:30.462 --> 55:32.962
- Me? What, are you nuts?
- Yeah, because--

55:33.045 --> 55:35.753
Because you're smart and bright
and you got a way with words.

55:35.753 --> 55:37.920
I can't talk to him.
I don't even know the guy.

55:38.045 --> 55:40.920
Yeah, well, he knows it was your idea
that I get out of the business.

55:41.045 --> 55:43.128
So he said he's gonna
kill you too.

55:43.254 --> 55:45.837
- He said he was gonna kill me?
- Yeah, 'cause it was your idea.

55:45.920 --> 55:49.920
He's gonna cut up my face
and put a bullet between your eyes.

55:50.045 --> 55:53.545
Really? Did he--
Did he specify the caliber?

55:53.628 --> 55:57.003
Listen, I just thought maybe
you could just reason with him.

55:57.003 --> 56:00.003
No, I can't.
I-- Listen, I never told you this,

56:00.129 --> 56:02.628
but I got a-- a slight
heart murmur...

56:02.711 --> 56:05.003
and right now
it's murmuring "hide."

56:05.129 --> 56:07.003
- I don't believe you're a coward.

56:07.129 --> 56:09.795
Only in actuality.
Um, this is not for me.

56:09.920 --> 56:12.586
- Lenny, I need your help.
- No, I'm not a violence person.

56:12.711 --> 56:16.586
I-I write about hockey and boxing
and football. This is not my world.

56:16.711 --> 56:19.878
Lenny, I do want to quit like you said,
but he said he's not gonna let me!

56:20.003 --> 56:22.586
- He's gonna hurt us both. Please!
- Relax, relax.

56:22.711 --> 56:25.586
What do you want me to do?
How am I gonna talk to him?

56:25.711 --> 56:27.670
- Well, okay. You just--
- I--

56:27.670 --> 56:31.003
You just talk because you're smarter
than he is and stronger than he is.

56:31.087 --> 56:33.795
You're a much better man. So just
remember that when you talk to him.

56:33.878 --> 56:37.670
He's a little bit intimidating.
He's got a bald head and an earring.

56:37.670 --> 56:40.795
- But you'll win. I know you will.
- Jesus, I-- I--

56:40.878 --> 56:42.962
You're a good man, Lenny.
You'll win.

56:43.087 --> 56:44.962
Look, in case anything
comes up,

56:45.087 --> 56:49.170
I want you to know that I-l'm
type O-positive, okay?

56:49.254 --> 56:52.254
Derek, I got the feeling you
came here and obviously moved...

56:52.379 --> 56:54.379
into this whole Knick persona.

56:54.379 --> 56:56.962
- Did you get caught up, maybe,
with a little bit of this Knick,
- Excuse me.

56:57.045 --> 56:59.462
"I gotta be physical,
I gotta be tough," and maybe--

56:59.462 --> 57:01.462
I'm, uh, I'm
Lenny Gildersleeve.

57:01.462 --> 57:04.753
I-- I'm a friend
of Linda-- Linda Ash's.

57:04.837 --> 57:08.254
And, uh, I thought
that perhaps we could--

57:08.337 --> 57:10.254
See--

57:10.337 --> 57:12.545
What I want to discuss
with you is that...

57:12.628 --> 57:15.628
there comes a time in the life
of every young woman,

57:15.753 --> 57:17.837
not just Linda, but everyone,

57:17.837 --> 57:21.628
that they-- they want to perhaps
make a change in their life.

57:21.753 --> 57:25.254
They maybe want to settle down
or explore alternative lifestyles.

57:25.337 --> 57:29.129
I don't think you've been a very good
influence on Linda, Mr. Weinrib.

57:29.129 --> 57:33.421
Weinrib. Right. So Gildersleeve
is a name I use for business purposes.

57:33.545 --> 57:35.920
- I got an investment in Linda.
- No question.

57:36.003 --> 57:38.503
I honor that. But--
But by now, she's probably...

57:38.628 --> 57:40.628
repaid you tenfold
or twentyfold or--

57:40.628 --> 57:43.795
Don't be so fuckin' sure, 'cause you
don't know what the fuckin' numbers are!

57:43.920 --> 57:46.920
That's a point well taken.
Excuse me, you're-- you're-- Excuse me.

57:47.003 --> 57:49.712
I-I-I understand what you're saying.
Is that a Pellegrino?

57:49.712 --> 57:53.004
Can I-- Because you've
bent my throat now a little bit.

57:53.004 --> 57:55.920
And, uh, the windpipe used to
hang straight until this moment.

57:56.004 --> 57:57.920
The fuckin' Knicks suck!

57:58.004 --> 57:59.878
They need a good shootin' forward.

58:00.004 --> 58:02.004
Yes, well, there's gonna
be a three-way trade.

58:02.087 --> 58:04.004
I don't know if you guys
heard anything about it.

58:04.087 --> 58:06.379
- Seattle, Atlanta
and the Knicks are talking.
- Bullshit.

58:06.379 --> 58:08.503
- No, no, no. I kid you not.
I know. It's in the air.
- Yeah?

58:08.586 --> 58:10.670
- They're discussing a trade.
- So what do you think about the Nets?

58:10.670 --> 58:12.795
- You think the Nets got a chance?
- The Nets? Yes, I do.

58:12.795 --> 58:15.170
If they're injury-free,
I think they have a good chance.

58:15.295 --> 58:17.586
I like the Nets. I think they're
one or two years away, is all.

58:17.670 --> 58:19.586
I would say two or three myself.

58:19.670 --> 58:22.670
You see, we have a common interest,
the three of us.

58:22.795 --> 58:25.462
- What were we talking about?
- Linda, Linda Ash.

58:25.586 --> 58:28.878
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That girl's goin' no place.

58:28.962 --> 58:32.462
She walks on me, I'll disfigure her
and I'll fuckin' kill you.

58:32.545 --> 58:35.878
See, that's exactly what
Dr. Kleinholtz would call "acting out."

58:35.962 --> 58:38.045
- Don't tell me how to run
my fuckin' business!
- I'm not!

58:38.045 --> 58:40.045
My girls do
what I tell 'em to do.

58:40.045 --> 58:42.045
Far be it for me to advise you.

58:42.045 --> 58:44.337
You obviously have a work ethic
that's specific to your needs.

58:44.462 --> 58:47.545
That's why you can afford
an establishment like this, you know.

58:47.545 --> 58:49.628
You're gonna take that from him?

58:49.753 --> 58:52.837
Take it easy. Take it easy.

58:52.837 --> 58:55.628
I'm about to have an
out-of-body-experience here.

58:55.753 --> 58:58.129
- Show strength.
- Show strength?

58:58.254 --> 59:01.129
This guy's gonna put me
into 27 separate Mason jars.

59:01.254 --> 59:04.545
The girl was right. They respect
strength. They despise cowardice.

59:04.628 --> 59:06.628
Power is all they know.
Stand firm.

59:06.712 --> 59:08.712
- Remember brave Achilles.
- Hey, don't get--

59:08.837 --> 59:12.212
Achilles only had an Achilles heel.
I have a full Achilles body.

59:12.212 --> 59:15.421
- Go on!

59:15.503 --> 59:18.004
Look, I'm gonna level
with you.

59:18.004 --> 59:20.920
I want to discuss
this Linda Ash thing and I-I--

59:21.004 --> 59:23.920
What are you so interested
in Linda for anyway, huh?

59:23.920 --> 59:26.628
- Are you fuckin' her?
- No, we have a strictly
platonic relationship.

59:26.712 --> 59:28.628
- Yeah?
- It's a good shirt.

59:28.712 --> 59:32.004
Well, if you're a friend of hers, don't
be putting stupid ideas in her head.

59:32.004 --> 59:34.503
She's liable to get hurt.
You too.

59:34.503 --> 59:36.587
You're gonna
let him do that to you?

59:36.712 --> 59:39.212
Hey, look. Would you do me a favor
and go back to Athens?

59:39.212 --> 59:43.503
You gonna let your son's mother remain
a white slave to this two-bit pimp?

59:43.587 --> 59:45.503
It-- It's starting
to look that way, isn't it?

59:45.587 --> 59:47.503
- You get them Knicks tickets yet?
- No tickets.

59:47.587 --> 59:49.503
- I tried everywhere.

59:49.587 --> 59:52.795
- Do you need tickets to the
Knicks game? Because I--
- Why? Who do you know?

59:52.878 --> 59:54.795
Me? I-I can help you.

59:54.878 --> 59:57.170
We want seats on the floor,
next to the movie stars.

59:57.170 --> 59:59.962
If you want to discuss a deal with
Linda, I can get you courtside seats.

1:00:00.087 --> 1:00:02.296
You can't get 'em.
Nobody can get 'em, 'cause I tried.

1:00:02.379 --> 1:00:04.962
No, I can, though.
I-- I'm a sportswriter. I can get 'em.

1:00:05.087 --> 1:00:07.670
I'd fuckin' give you my mother
for courtside seats,

1:00:07.670 --> 1:00:09.670
much less this cheap little whore.

1:00:09.753 --> 1:00:12.753
That's perfectly put, succinctly put.
I know what point you're making.

1:00:12.879 --> 1:00:15.545
- But if you're tryin'
to fuckin' pull something,
- Easy. Take it--

1:00:15.670 --> 1:00:18.462
I will shoot you and her
through the fuckin' eyeballs!

1:00:18.545 --> 1:00:21.670
It's silly to haggle over details.

1:00:21.753 --> 1:00:24.837
Well, I'll get the tickets.
I'll get the tickets, I promise.

1:00:24.962 --> 1:00:27.337
Then we can discuss Linda.

1:00:34.837 --> 1:00:36.753
Dad, are you very brave?

1:00:36.837 --> 1:00:39.753
Am I brave? It's funny
you should ask that question.

1:00:39.837 --> 1:00:42.753
Who'd win a fight,
you versus Mike Tyson?

1:00:42.837 --> 1:00:45.337
What? What?
Who would win what?

1:00:45.337 --> 1:00:48.337
Who'd win a fight,
you versus Mike Tyson?

1:00:48.337 --> 1:00:51.837
- Me versus Mike Tyson?
Who do you think would win?
- You?

1:00:51.837 --> 1:00:53.837
There'd be no contest,
you know.

1:00:53.837 --> 1:00:57.337
He would probably take the early rounds,
but I'd get to him eventually.

1:00:57.337 --> 1:01:00.837
I'd chase him all over the ring.
It's my style. Always was.

1:01:00.837 --> 1:01:03.795
On the whole, I think it
will work. Yeah, I think it will.

1:01:03.795 --> 1:01:07.296
The only thing is, I want the gallery
to be lit from above,

1:01:07.296 --> 1:01:10.296
so I guess the skylight
will have to be enlarged.

1:01:10.296 --> 1:01:12.795
- Honey? Bed? Could you?
- Me or him?

1:01:12.795 --> 1:01:15.795
Him. Please?

1:01:23.712 --> 1:01:26.587
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I can't do this. I can't.

1:01:26.712 --> 1:01:30.587
-Why are you fighting this?
-'Cause I'm married and I have a family.

1:01:30.670 --> 1:01:32.587
A-And I love Lenny.

1:01:33.795 --> 1:01:35.795
I love him.

1:01:35.795 --> 1:01:38.296
So, who are you trying
to convince, you or me?

1:01:44.753 --> 1:01:47.254
- I got you a present.
- You're kidding.

1:01:47.254 --> 1:01:50.254
Yeah. For fixing things up
with me and Ricky.

1:01:50.379 --> 1:01:53.254
- I know he can be really rough.
- That was completely unnecessary.

1:01:53.379 --> 1:01:55.254
Very sweet,
but completely unnecessary.

1:01:55.379 --> 1:01:59.171
You didn't want a blow job, so the least
I could do was get you a tie.

1:01:59.254 --> 1:02:01.171
Good thinking.
That's uh-- Oh!

1:02:01.254 --> 1:02:03.670
- Yes, it's a tie, isn't it?

1:02:03.754 --> 1:02:07.171
- Would you ever
wear anything that bright?
- If the occasion demanded.

1:02:07.254 --> 1:02:11.337
You know, like if I ever get invited
to the Mardi Gras, I could--

1:02:11.463 --> 1:02:14.837
Oh, good. Lenny, do you want
a sandwich? I'm gonna have a sandwich.

1:02:14.962 --> 1:02:17.837
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.
- Oh, okay.

1:02:17.920 --> 1:02:20.337
- It's great.
- Good.

1:02:20.421 --> 1:02:22.337
You know what, Lenny?

1:02:22.421 --> 1:02:25.837
I couldn't get your son's picture
out of my mind.

1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:28.837
- Well, he's a very cute kid, you know.
- Yeah.

1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:30.837
Len?

1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:33.837
I think I would be
a good mother.

1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:36.837
I think you'd be a great mother.
You're very affectionate.

1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:38.837
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1:02:38.920 --> 1:02:42.296
I would like to start over again.
Maybe have a house. That would be nice.

1:02:42.421 --> 1:02:45.296
It would be great, you know.
I think it'd be fabulous.

1:02:45.421 --> 1:02:47.296
- And you could do it.
- Yeah?

1:02:47.421 --> 1:02:50.296
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- The problem is, now,
finding the right guy.

1:02:50.421 --> 1:02:53.296
I need to find somebody
who'll love me, you know.

1:02:53.421 --> 1:02:55.296
Somebody who'll take care
of me and respect me.

1:02:55.421 --> 1:02:57.421
Well, I'll keep my eye open.

1:02:57.421 --> 1:02:59.879
You know, maybe--
maybe-- who knows?

1:02:59.879 --> 1:03:03.879
The only thing is, Len,
he'd have to be as smart as me.

1:03:03.879 --> 1:03:07.379
I'm sure there's somebody out there,
you know, that can--

1:03:07.379 --> 1:03:09.879
- You'll find an equal somewhere.
- Yeah?

1:03:09.879 --> 1:03:12.879
And don't worry, Len.
I gave up on you.

1:03:12.879 --> 1:03:14.879
- M--
- I knew it couldn't be.

1:03:14.879 --> 1:03:18.087
Let me tell you, at my age,
if I made love with you,

1:03:18.171 --> 1:03:20.587
they would have to
put me on a resuscitator.

1:03:20.587 --> 1:03:22.087
Ha.

1:03:22.087 --> 1:03:24.087
-  This is Max.

1:03:24.087 --> 1:03:26.087
- Max.
- This is my kid.

1:03:26.087 --> 1:03:28.087
- How old are you?
- I'm five.

1:03:28.087 --> 1:03:30.087
- You're five? You gonna be a fighter?
- Yeah.

1:03:30.171 --> 1:03:33.046
Max is gonna be
a middleweight when he gets older.

1:03:33.171 --> 1:03:36.046
He's gonna be a heavyweight,
the way you're carryin' him.

1:03:36.171 --> 1:03:39.670
I'm gonna teach you how to box, Max.
I'm gonna show you a combination punch.

1:03:39.754 --> 1:03:42.670
One-five, one-five.
Two, three and four, you're gonna get.

1:03:42.754 --> 1:03:45.670
- Hey, Ray. This is my kid Max.
- How you doin', Max?

1:03:45.754 --> 1:03:48.628
Max is gonna be a middleweight
when he gets older.

1:03:48.754 --> 1:03:52.046
- Maybe a heavyweight?
Yeah, I think a heavyweight.

1:03:52.046 --> 1:03:55.046
- You wanna go hit the bag with me?
- Okay.

1:03:55.046 --> 1:03:57.046
- Nice kid.
- He's a doll.

1:03:57.046 --> 1:03:59.046
So, what's with
the Sanchez thing?

1:03:59.046 --> 1:04:02.046
Is he gonna win that?
ls he training? ls he not training?

1:04:02.129 --> 1:04:05.046
- He can do it. He's in
the best shape of his life.
- Yeah?

1:04:05.129 --> 1:04:08.046
The only thing is, you don't know
what these guys do outside the gym.

1:04:08.129 --> 1:04:11.046
- Well, that's the point.
You hear all these stories.
- He'll be all right.

1:04:11.129 --> 1:04:14.503
Hey, Kevin, come here. I wanna introduce
you to my friend Lenny Weinrib.

1:04:14.629 --> 1:04:18.503
- He's a sportswriter.
He writes about boxing.
- How you doin'?

1:04:18.629 --> 1:04:22.004
- Listen, I'm gonna get
warmed up, all right?
- Show us what you can do.

1:04:22.129 --> 1:04:25.004
- My hand's still a little sore.
- Wrap it up good. You'll be okay.

1:04:25.129 --> 1:04:28.503
- I don't know that kid.
- This kid can move. He hits good too.

1:04:28.629 --> 1:04:30.503
Got nice hand speed,
you know?

1:04:30.587 --> 1:04:34.004
Only thing is, you don't know about
these guys-- sometimes they lack desire.

1:04:34.087 --> 1:04:37.004
I seen it a million times. I don't know
if he's got the killer instinct.

1:04:37.087 --> 1:04:41.004
Keeps talkin' about goin' back upstate
where he comes from on an onion farm.

1:04:41.087 --> 1:04:44.503
- He wants to be an onion farmer.
You believe it?
- That kid's a farmer?

1:04:44.587 --> 1:04:47.004
He's an onion farmer, yeah. I don't know
how long he's gonna stick around.

1:04:47.087 --> 1:04:51.004
That's the problem. It's a shame too;
he hits like a fuckin' mule.

1:04:51.087 --> 1:04:54.503
He's fast, but he wants to quit boxing,
go back and hang out on the farm.

1:04:54.587 --> 1:04:56.463
You know, retire.

1:04:56.463 --> 1:04:59.962
And the worst thing of all is,
his girlfriend left him.

1:04:59.962 --> 1:05:01.962
- She quit on him.
- Really?

1:05:01.962 --> 1:05:03.962
Took him for everything
he's got.

1:05:03.962 --> 1:05:07.962
He's a nice, sweet kid, but between you
and I, he ain't got too much upstairs.

1:05:07.962 --> 1:05:10.962
They're all alike.
Hey, Len, what's the matter with you?

1:05:11.087 --> 1:05:13.962
Looks like you got somethin'
on your mind. I don't understand.

1:05:14.046 --> 1:05:15.962
Hey, Bo!

1:05:15.962 --> 1:05:18.962
This-- This is the left,
and this is the right.

1:05:18.962 --> 1:05:21.962
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah, Kevin, that's right.

1:05:21.962 --> 1:05:23.962
Yeah.

1:05:25.046 --> 1:05:27.046
Bye-bye.

1:05:27.046 --> 1:05:30.046
- Hi, Lenny. I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

1:05:30.046 --> 1:05:33.046
- It's starting to rain.
- Oh, I don't have an umbrella.

1:05:33.046 --> 1:05:36.545
I met a guy this afternoon that I think
would be absolutely great for you.

1:05:36.545 --> 1:05:38.545
- Perfect.
- For me?

1:05:38.545 --> 1:05:41.545
- Yes. He's young,
he's strong, he's healthy.
- What does he do?

1:05:41.545 --> 1:05:44.545
H-H-He's, you know, like,
dicking around in agriculture.

1:05:44.629 --> 1:05:46.545
What's wrong with his dick?

1:05:46.629 --> 1:05:48.545
No, no, no, he's a farmer.
The guy's a farmer.

1:05:48.629 --> 1:05:51.545
- You met a farmer?
- Yeah, an onion farmer. It's great.

1:05:51.629 --> 1:05:53.503
- Where?
- At the gym.

1:05:53.629 --> 1:05:56.421
What the hell is an onion farmer
doing at the gym?

1:05:56.503 --> 1:06:00.421
He's-- He's f-finishing a-a-a
very productive career as a boxer.

1:06:00.503 --> 1:06:02.421
A boxer? Oh, Lenny.

1:06:02.503 --> 1:06:05.921
No, he's-- Look, he doesn't
want to be a boxer anymore.

1:06:06.004 --> 1:06:09.921
H-He's-- He wants to meet
the right girl and be a farmer.

1:06:10.004 --> 1:06:13.921
- Don't look at me.
- He's per-- His brother has
a big onion farm upstate.

1:06:14.004 --> 1:06:17.004
Just think of it.
It'd be so great.

1:06:17.004 --> 1:06:21.213
A small town, and you're-- y-you're
hairdressing and, and raising kids.

1:06:21.296 --> 1:06:23.213
What small town?

1:06:23.296 --> 1:06:25.712
- Wampsville.
- Where?

1:06:25.795 --> 1:06:28.171
Wampsville.
It's an old Indian name.

1:06:28.296 --> 1:06:30.171
I-I-It's a place rich
in American heritage.

1:06:30.296 --> 1:06:32.171
Are you off
your fucking rocker?

1:06:32.296 --> 1:06:35.670
I'm gonna go marry an onion farmer
and do hair in Wimpsville?

1:06:35.795 --> 1:06:37.670
Wampsville,
not Wimpsville.

1:06:37.795 --> 1:06:39.962
It's so perfect.
He's a nice, sweet guy.

1:06:39.962 --> 1:06:41.962
Oh, come on. Forget it.

1:06:41.962 --> 1:06:44.962
He's perfect, though.
He's bright-- You'll think he's bright.

1:06:44.962 --> 1:06:47.962
- He is a fucking onion farmer.
- That's okay.

1:06:47.962 --> 1:06:50.962
He's a nice kid.
More important, he's honest and decent.

1:06:51.087 --> 1:06:53.962
And don't offer to give him a blow job
in the first five minutes,

1:06:54.046 --> 1:06:56.962
- 'cause he thinks you're a hairdresser.
- You lied?

1:06:57.046 --> 1:06:58.962
- I--
- You shouldn't lie.

1:06:59.046 --> 1:07:02.545
Just do what I'm telling you.
Just listen to me for once.

1:07:02.545 --> 1:07:04.545
I'm off the girls,
Lenny.

1:07:04.545 --> 1:07:07.545
I mean, the last girl I was with
cheated me out of all my dough, man.

1:07:07.545 --> 1:07:10.545
I'm telling you, this is a nice kid,
Kevin. She's nice.

1:07:10.545 --> 1:07:13.545
-This the hairdresser you told me about?
-This is the hairdresser.

1:07:13.545 --> 1:07:17.545
I gave you a big buildup.
This girl could have her
pick of any guy she wants.

1:07:17.545 --> 1:07:20.046
- I said good things about you.
- What'd you tell her?

1:07:20.046 --> 1:07:23.046
I told her you were handsome,
a good-looking guy;

1:07:23.129 --> 1:07:26.046
that you're a great athlete;
that you're gifted, bright.

1:07:26.129 --> 1:07:29.046
- You didn't lie.
- Would I lie? Of course not.

1:07:29.129 --> 1:07:31.046
You told her I could fight?

1:07:31.129 --> 1:07:33.046
I told her, but
what touches her heart...

1:07:33.129 --> 1:07:35.504
is that you want
to be a farmer.

1:07:35.629 --> 1:07:39.004
This is a girl that has a love
of the soil, I promise you.

1:07:39.129 --> 1:07:41.504
Onions. Onions.
My brother's got an onion farm.

1:07:41.629 --> 1:07:45.004
I wanna go back up there 'cause I
wanna get the hell outta this city.

1:07:45.129 --> 1:07:48.004
That's perfect! You mention onions
to Linda, she goes crazy!

1:07:48.129 --> 1:07:51.004
She goes nuts, you say "onion."

1:07:51.088 --> 1:07:54.004
You say "onion" to Linda,
the girl is just--

1:07:54.088 --> 1:07:57.004
All right, all right,
all right, all right, all right.

1:07:57.088 --> 1:07:59.004
That's her name?
Linda?

1:07:59.088 --> 1:08:03.004
Linda. It's a pretty name.
What are you so, so, so standoffish--

1:08:03.088 --> 1:08:06.504
- Is that with an "E-R" or a "U-R"?
- Is what with an "E-R" or--

1:08:06.587 --> 1:08:09.504
- "Linder"?
- Linda. Linda with an "A." Linda.

1:08:09.587 --> 1:08:11.504
- Oh.
- She's a great kid.

1:08:11.587 --> 1:08:13.504
And she's
a substantial woman.

1:08:13.587 --> 1:08:15.463
This is not a dumb girl.

1:08:15.587 --> 1:08:19.463
This girl has got a PhD i-i-in...
root and follicle culture.

1:08:19.587 --> 1:08:22.463
- And she's pretty, right?
- To die. She's to die.

1:08:22.587 --> 1:08:24.962
'Cause that's important.
'Cause I've been stung.

1:08:25.088 --> 1:08:27.962
The last girl I was with
drove me up the wall, man.

1:08:28.088 --> 1:08:31.754
- She made my stomach
sick to the stomach.
- Linda is church people.

1:08:31.879 --> 1:08:34.254
- That's what I want.
I want a church girl.
- She's great.

1:08:34.380 --> 1:08:38.254
I want a nice church girl; I don't want
one of these fast New York sluts.

1:08:38.380 --> 1:08:42.254
I want a nice, homely girl
who likes to raise a family
and dogs and that kind of thing.

1:08:42.338 --> 1:08:45.545
Can I say two words to you?
Can I say two words?

1:08:45.670 --> 1:08:47.545
Butter churn. Okay?

1:08:47.670 --> 1:08:50.046
Butter churn.
This is a pioneer girl.

1:08:50.129 --> 1:08:53.046
This is a girl who is practically,
incidentally, a virgin.

1:08:53.129 --> 1:08:55.046
What do you mean,
"practically"?

1:08:55.046 --> 1:08:59.545
I wanna level with you-- sh-she's slept
with one or two guys in her life.

1:08:59.545 --> 1:09:01.545
An old college professor...

1:09:01.545 --> 1:09:03.545
a-a-and her childhood
sweetheart.

1:09:03.629 --> 1:09:06.545
But both of them were killed
in combat for their nation.

1:09:06.629 --> 1:09:09.545
- It's a sad story.
- A professor got killed in combat?

1:09:09.629 --> 1:09:11.545
Humanities regiment.

1:09:11.629 --> 1:09:14.921
You know, they were the first ones
to land at Anzio. I'm telling you--

1:09:14.921 --> 1:09:18.004
You said she was an actress?
She's been in some films?

1:09:18.129 --> 1:09:22.004
-She's had a couple of good roles, yeah.
-She's ever been in anything I seen?

1:09:22.129 --> 1:09:25.004
Hey-- You didn't see
Schindler's List?

1:09:25.129 --> 1:09:29.504
No, no, no-- T-That was-- That was--
That was the one with the Jews and, um--

1:09:29.629 --> 1:09:32.504
- Who were the bad guys?
- The blond guys were the Nazis.

1:09:32.587 --> 1:09:34.921
- They were tough motherfuckers.
- Yeah, all right.

1:09:35.004 --> 1:09:38.004
I'm telling you, this is a good girl.
She's wonderful.

1:09:38.004 --> 1:09:40.004
He's playing God.

1:09:40.004 --> 1:09:42.504
It would be nice
if he could bring this off.

1:09:42.504 --> 1:09:44.004
It's hubris!

1:09:44.004 --> 1:09:46.587
He spent a lot of time
preparing her.

1:10:24.338 --> 1:10:27.255
Listen, have you, uh--

1:10:27.338 --> 1:10:30.754
given any more thought
to what we discussed?

1:10:30.837 --> 1:10:32.754
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1:10:32.837 --> 1:10:37.754
I mean-- Look, the problem is, I don't
know how I feel anymore; I'm confused.

1:10:37.837 --> 1:10:40.754
- I--
- Listen, Amanda, I love you.

1:10:40.837 --> 1:10:42.754
Yeah?

1:10:42.837 --> 1:10:47.213
You're never gonna be able to forgive
yourself if you don't give it a try.

1:10:58.338 --> 1:11:00.213
Kevin.

1:11:00.338 --> 1:11:03.712
This is Linda.
Linda, this is, uh--

1:11:03.796 --> 1:11:05.712
This is Kevin.

1:11:06.796 --> 1:11:08.712
- How you doin'?
- Hi.

1:11:10.296 --> 1:11:12.213
So--

1:11:14.088 --> 1:11:18.296
I'll go and-- I just wanted to
bring you guys together, you know.

1:11:19.712 --> 1:11:22.213
You know, you could
maybe stick around, maybe.

1:11:22.213 --> 1:11:24.213
You know, we could
go out or somethin'.

1:11:24.213 --> 1:11:27.171
- Yeah.
- No, no. I'm completely superfluous.

1:11:28.171 --> 1:11:30.171
Oh, you don't feel good?

1:11:30.171 --> 1:11:32.671
No, I'm superfluous.
I'm completely unnecessary.

1:11:32.671 --> 1:11:37.171
You guys can have a great time
and I'll-- I got stuff to do, you know.

1:11:38.587 --> 1:11:42.171
- I got these for you.
- What are these, daisies?

1:11:42.171 --> 1:11:44.171
- Uh--
- That's great.

1:11:44.171 --> 1:11:46.171
That's nice.

1:11:46.171 --> 1:11:47.671
Yeah-- Ye-- Yeah.

1:11:47.671 --> 1:11:50.171
I thought you said
that he was a farmer.

1:11:50.255 --> 1:11:52.380
Well, he is-- He's a farmer.

1:11:52.463 --> 1:11:55.963
- I know they're not onions.
- Daisies make me sneeze, Lenny.

1:11:56.046 --> 1:11:59.046
Come here a minute.
Excuse us one second.

1:11:59.046 --> 1:12:02.046
They're beautiful flowers. Tell him
they're beautiful and enjoy yourself.

1:12:02.046 --> 1:12:05.046
- I could hold the flowers.
- I know, but they just make me sneeze.

1:12:05.046 --> 1:12:09.046
- She sneezes with flowers.
That's good luck if you sneeze.
- I'll hold the flowers.

1:12:09.046 --> 1:12:12.546
- Thanks.
- Go ahead, have fun. I'll see you guys.

1:12:12.546 --> 1:12:14.546
I'm gonna go.

1:12:14.546 --> 1:12:16.546
Take care.

1:12:21.546 --> 1:12:24.046
So, y-- you're pretty.

1:12:24.130 --> 1:12:26.546
Uh-- He's...
tellin' the truth.

1:12:26.629 --> 1:12:28.546
- You're really...
- Oh.

1:12:28.629 --> 1:12:30.546
pretty.

1:12:30.629 --> 1:12:34.421
- Thanks. You're not so bad yourself.
- Yeah, I know.

1:12:34.421 --> 1:12:37.421
I bet you're hung
like a horse.

1:12:37.421 --> 1:12:39.421
- Yeah, I can ride a horse.
- Yeah?

1:12:39.421 --> 1:12:42.921
You know, my brother's got a farm,
you know. I love animals.

1:12:42.921 --> 1:12:47.921
I like animals. He's got a farm up there
with the ducks and the pigs and, um--

1:12:47.921 --> 1:12:49.921
Oh, yeah.
In Wisconsin.

1:12:49.921 --> 1:12:51.921
Wampsville.

1:14:20.422 --> 1:14:23.296
Yeah. How long
were you doin' hair?

1:14:26.422 --> 1:14:29.296
- That's right, 'cause you
were doin' the acting, right?
- Yeah.

1:14:29.422 --> 1:14:32.796
- That's right. I didn't
get to see Schindler's List.
- Me neither.

1:14:32.921 --> 1:14:36.296
But what were some of the other films
you were in?

1:14:36.422 --> 1:14:39.296
Well, I did
The Enchanted, uh--

1:14:39.380 --> 1:14:42.296
- Salad.
- The Enchanted Salad?

1:14:42.380 --> 1:14:45.296
What was that about?
Is it good?

1:14:45.380 --> 1:14:48.296
Yeah, it was really good.
It was about a waitress.

1:14:48.380 --> 1:14:49.796
Yeah.

1:14:51.296 --> 1:14:54.296
- I had a really good time
with you tonight.
- Did you?

1:14:54.296 --> 1:14:56.296
- Yeah.
- Really? Me too.

1:14:56.296 --> 1:14:59.296
Yeah, you're really good
at arcade games, you know.

1:14:59.296 --> 1:15:02.296
Well, I used to date
a pinball champ, not for nothing.

1:15:02.296 --> 1:15:05.380
Pinball ch-- Was it, like,
a serious relationship?

1:15:05.380 --> 1:15:09.380
Well, we were getting engaged,
but then two guys strangled him.

1:15:09.463 --> 1:15:11.380
Oh.

1:15:13.171 --> 1:15:16.380
- You know what I like in a woman?
- What?

1:15:16.380 --> 1:15:19.838
I like, like, um,
an old-fashioned girl, you know,

1:15:19.838 --> 1:15:21.838
Iike my-my mom.

1:15:21.838 --> 1:15:26.338
Like, a girl who likes to take care
of the house and cook and clean...

1:15:26.338 --> 1:15:31.338
and doesn't mind walkin' the dogs and
doin' the lawn and that kind of thing.

1:15:31.338 --> 1:15:34.629
You know what I mean?
That's like my mom.

1:15:34.754 --> 1:15:36.629
Yeah.

1:15:36.754 --> 1:15:39.629
What do you like in a man?

1:15:39.754 --> 1:15:42.629
I like a guy
who has a good job,

1:15:42.754 --> 1:15:45.713
who treats me nice
and, um--

1:15:45.713 --> 1:15:48.213
Well, who's kinda
built like you.

1:15:48.213 --> 1:15:51.213
Doesn't have to stuff a sock
in his jock to look good.

1:15:51.213 --> 1:15:52.713
Mm-hmm.

1:15:52.713 --> 1:15:56.213
- You know what my dream is?
- What?

1:15:58.338 --> 1:16:00.338
I'm in a field, right?

1:16:00.422 --> 1:16:03.297
And, like, this hawk comes...

1:16:03.422 --> 1:16:06.297
and picks me up
in his beak, right?

1:16:06.422 --> 1:16:10.504
And then flies me, like, all over
the world so I see everything.

1:16:10.588 --> 1:16:13.504
And then, like, he flies me
out of the country...

1:16:13.588 --> 1:16:17.088
and, like, we go up to
the north pole and he drops me...

1:16:17.088 --> 1:16:19.088
in the snow.

1:16:19.088 --> 1:16:21.588
And I'm just layin' there...

1:16:21.588 --> 1:16:23.588
naked.

1:16:27.005 --> 1:16:29.005
What's your dream?

1:16:30.671 --> 1:16:35.880
My dream is that somebody would come
along and think that I was special,

1:16:35.963 --> 1:16:40.880
that, you know-- that they'd wanna
come and change my life for me.

1:16:40.963 --> 1:16:42.880
That's my dream.

1:16:44.088 --> 1:16:46.255
You could have that.

1:16:46.255 --> 1:16:49.255
- You think?
- Yeah, I think.

1:16:49.380 --> 1:16:52.880
You could definitely have that,
a pretty girl like you.

1:16:56.171 --> 1:16:58.171
So, you think, um,

1:16:58.171 --> 1:17:01.171
I'm gonna get to see you
again, Linda, or what?

1:17:01.171 --> 1:17:03.671
Do you want to?

1:17:03.671 --> 1:17:05.838
A lot.

1:17:05.963 --> 1:17:07.838
I want to a lot.

1:17:09.629 --> 1:17:11.629
Me too.

1:17:14.130 --> 1:17:17.046
True love.
As refreshing as spring.

1:17:17.130 --> 1:17:19.046
They kissed good night.

1:17:19.130 --> 1:17:22.046
And saw each other
the very next night, and the next.

1:17:22.130 --> 1:17:25.130
Hold it, everybody.
Something's coming in.

1:17:25.130 --> 1:17:28.130
- A bulletin!
- Uh-oh. Here comes Miss Party Pooper.

1:17:28.130 --> 1:17:31.130
Tiresias, the blind seer
of Thebes.

1:17:31.130 --> 1:17:34.338
- I have a vision of him and Weinrib.
-  Where?

1:17:34.422 --> 1:17:36.338
Wait.

1:17:36.422 --> 1:17:38.338
The Acropolis.

1:17:48.297 --> 1:17:50.297
Oh, Weinrib.

1:17:50.297 --> 1:17:52.297
I saw your wife.

1:17:52.297 --> 1:17:54.297
- Amanda.
- You know me?

1:17:54.297 --> 1:17:57.796
Yeah. I saw her.
She was workin' late at the gallery.

1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:00.796
And with her was this,
uh, Jerry Bender guy.

1:18:00.880 --> 1:18:03.796
Well, that's nothing. She works
with Jerry Bender. Nothing unusual.

1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:05.796
- You didn't let me finish.
- Go on.

1:18:05.880 --> 1:18:07.796
Uh, they spoke
in intimate tones...

1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:11.297
and then, uh, Bender rose
and laid a big wet one on her.

1:18:11.380 --> 1:18:14.297
- A big we-- Bender kissed Amanda?
- That's what I'm tellin' ya.

1:18:14.380 --> 1:18:17.796
Hey, you must've known somethin'
was going on for a while, huh?

1:18:17.880 --> 1:18:20.297
Yeah, I always thought
that Bender had eyes for her.

1:18:20.380 --> 1:18:22.297
Now he's got eyes and hands.

1:18:22.380 --> 1:18:24.880
Jesus-- Well, Amanda
didn't respond, did she?

1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:28.464
No. She just opened her mouth
very wide and stuck her tongue out...

1:18:28.464 --> 1:18:32.046
as far as it was
humanly possible to go.

1:18:32.172 --> 1:18:34.046
Jeez--
Are you sure?

1:18:34.172 --> 1:18:37.046
Well, hey-- Does the Trojan horse
have a wooden dick?

1:18:37.172 --> 1:18:40.546
- And then she, she pushed
her abdomen against his.
- All right, all right!

1:18:40.671 --> 1:18:43.546
I got the picture!
I knew it! I always suspected.

1:18:43.671 --> 1:18:48.046
Ah, it's somethin' you don't wanna know,
but you hadda be blind not to see it.

1:18:48.130 --> 1:18:51.755
- Yeah. Oh, God. I'm gonna confront her.
- Oh, no, not in front of Max!

1:18:51.838 --> 1:18:55.755
No, Max-- Max has got a sleep-over date
at his friend's house.

1:18:55.755 --> 1:18:58.921
- Oh.
- No. I knew it. Down deep, I knew it.

1:18:59.046 --> 1:19:02.422
Uh, thanks, Weinrib.
Thanks.

1:19:02.546 --> 1:19:05.629
Ah, thank you.
God bless you.

1:19:05.713 --> 1:19:08.713
Oh, my God!
It's more serious than we thought!

1:19:08.838 --> 1:19:12.213
It's very serious.
Her marriage to Lenny is in crisis.

1:19:12.338 --> 1:19:16.629
With the passage of time,
even the strongest bonds become fragile.

1:19:16.713 --> 1:19:19.629
Great, fellas.
It sounds like a fortune cookie.

1:19:19.713 --> 1:19:21.796
O Zeus,
most potent of gods!

1:19:21.921 --> 1:19:24.796
We implore thee!
We need your help!

1:19:24.921 --> 1:19:28.796
Zeus! Great Zeus!
Hear us! Hear us!

1:19:28.921 --> 1:19:30.796
We call out to thee!

1:19:30.921 --> 1:19:33.796
Um, this is Zeus.
I'm not home right now.

1:19:33.921 --> 1:19:37.588
But you can leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

1:19:37.713 --> 1:19:40.713
- Please start speaking at the tone.

1:19:40.796 --> 1:19:44.297
Call us when you get in!
We need help!

1:19:44.380 --> 1:19:47.297
God, I think
I should move out.

1:19:47.380 --> 1:19:50.297
I-I-I can't understand this.
Wh-Wh-- This is so radical.

1:19:50.380 --> 1:19:52.796
No, 'cause I can't cheat.
Jerry Bender's in love with me.

1:19:52.880 --> 1:19:54.796
This is crazy.

1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:58.796
Are you telling me you're in love with
him, you're in love with Jerry Bender?

1:19:58.880 --> 1:20:01.297
I don't know.
I gotta find out.

1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:04.255
- What do you mean, "you don't know"?
- I don't know!

1:20:04.380 --> 1:20:07.255
What do you mean?
Are you in love with him or not?

1:20:07.380 --> 1:20:10.255
Anyway, Lenny, let's face it--
things have changed between us.

1:20:10.380 --> 1:20:13.255
But we can fix things.
What about Max? Max--

1:20:13.380 --> 1:20:17.255
He'll be okay. Maybe it will
be better for him with us apart...

1:20:17.380 --> 1:20:20.755
- instead of together
and arguing all of the time.
- That's crazy.

1:20:20.838 --> 1:20:22.755
I just think that's crazy.

1:20:23.963 --> 1:20:25.838
Well, I-- I can't have
this conversation.

1:20:25.963 --> 1:20:28.339
I-- This is too crazy. I'm--

1:20:28.464 --> 1:20:31.339
- Where are you going?
- I'm going out. I have to think.

1:20:31.464 --> 1:20:34.255
I have to get
my thoughts together.

1:21:01.130 --> 1:21:04.213
- I been waitin' for you, man.
- Kevin, leave me alone.

1:21:04.297 --> 1:21:07.005
- I'm in a very, very bad mood.
- You're in a very bad mood?

1:21:07.130 --> 1:21:11.005
How could you do this? How could you
set me up with this stupid girl?

1:21:11.088 --> 1:21:15.005
- What are you talking about?
- You didn't tell me she was a hooker...

1:21:15.088 --> 1:21:19.005
and that she did porno films and had sex
with hundreds and hundreds of men...

1:21:19.088 --> 1:21:22.005
and women and who the hell
knows what else!

1:21:22.088 --> 1:21:24.005
- I thought it would prejudice you.
- What?

1:21:24.088 --> 1:21:26.005
How did you find out?

1:21:26.088 --> 1:21:29.297
I-l call my friends up and I tell 'em
I got this girl that I wanna marry.

1:21:29.297 --> 1:21:33.880
They have me over for a few drinks and
my friend Ray puts in this sexy video.

1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:36.380
But I'm not really
into pornography, you know.

1:21:36.380 --> 1:21:40.172
- I look on the screen and this
actress is up there: Judy Cum.

1:21:40.297 --> 1:21:43.671
Kevin, I told you she had
dramatic aspirations.

1:21:43.755 --> 1:21:47.671
- I flew off the handle.
- Oh, Christ. I thought
you were a broad-minded guy.

1:21:47.755 --> 1:21:52.172
I came over here and she confessed to
everything, and then I-- and I hit her.

1:21:52.255 --> 1:21:55.172
- You hit her? You hi--
- I was gonna break your neck, man!

1:21:55.172 --> 1:21:58.671
- I don't believe this. You hit her?
- I don't believe this!

1:21:58.671 --> 1:22:01.671
- You hit her? For Christ's--
- A little bit.

1:22:01.671 --> 1:22:05.172
- God.
- I called my mother. I was upset,
so then she says I should come home.

1:22:05.172 --> 1:22:08.130
- So I'm gonna get the hell
outta this place, man.
- I don't understand you.

1:22:08.130 --> 1:22:11.130
You're a broad-minded guy.
People change. You gonna
hold her past against her?

1:22:11.130 --> 1:22:14.130
- Yeah, I'm gonna--
A porno star!
- You love her, she loves you!

1:22:14.130 --> 1:22:17.130
- What are you talking about?
- Forget it, man. It's over.

1:22:17.130 --> 1:22:20.130
I told you from day one
the girl was not a virgin.

1:22:20.130 --> 1:22:23.130
You didn't tell me
how many times though!

1:22:23.255 --> 1:22:25.130
- Thanks for nothin', Lenny, man.
- Kevin!

1:22:25.214 --> 1:22:27.130
Nah, man!

1:22:39.422 --> 1:22:41.630
- He hit me.

1:22:41.713 --> 1:22:44.713
I know, I-- I ran into him
downstairs and he--

1:22:44.796 --> 1:22:47.713
Oh, Jesus, look at you.

1:22:47.796 --> 1:22:49.713
God, does it feel terrible?

1:22:49.796 --> 1:22:52.713
No, not really. Just my ulcer.

1:22:52.796 --> 1:22:56.297
Your ulcer? Well, you know,
you shouldn't be drinking.

1:22:56.422 --> 1:22:59.796
- Hmm.
- That's the worst--
Oh, God, look at that.

1:22:59.880 --> 1:23:01.796
Boy.

1:23:04.005 --> 1:23:07.505
- Remember you once said
we were a couple of losers?
- Yeah.

1:23:07.505 --> 1:23:10.505
Well, I think
that's definitely true.

1:23:10.505 --> 1:23:13.505
- Why? What happened to you?

1:23:15.464 --> 1:23:17.380
Amanda left me.

1:23:17.464 --> 1:23:20.880
Oh. I'm sorry, Lenny.

1:23:20.963 --> 1:23:23.380
Would you like a drink?

1:23:23.464 --> 1:23:25.380
Mmm. No.

1:24:16.713 --> 1:24:20.339
What's, uh-- What's--
What's the matter?

1:24:21.922 --> 1:24:24.005
I-- I don't know.

1:24:32.922 --> 1:24:35.797
Was she great?
You can tell me.

1:24:35.922 --> 1:24:37.797
Was she--
Was she great in bed?

1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:41.797
- A woman with all that experience.
- I don't know.

1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:44.797
I just know that suddenly
I really miss Amanda.

1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:46.797
But wait!
See who approaches!

1:24:46.880 --> 1:24:49.297
There you are!
Where have you been?

1:24:49.381 --> 1:24:51.797
I've been looking for you
all over.

1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:55.588
I was just out drinking
and thinking about everything.

1:24:55.671 --> 1:24:57.588
Oh, Lenny, I'm sorry.

1:24:57.671 --> 1:25:01.588
I, uh-- I was up all night
thinking how much I hurt you...

1:25:01.671 --> 1:25:04.588
and how much
I'd messed us up for good,

1:25:04.671 --> 1:25:07.588
and the thought
of not being with you.

1:25:07.671 --> 1:25:11.047
I love you.
I don't love Jerry at all.

1:25:11.172 --> 1:25:14.546
We have to put things right,
whatever has to be done.

1:25:30.130 --> 1:25:32.755
she drove upstate to Wampsville and
pleaded with Kevin to take her back...

1:25:32.838 --> 1:25:34.546
but to no avail.

1:25:34.630 --> 1:25:38.546
Anyway, on the way home she was
distraught and felt life held no hope...

1:25:38.630 --> 1:25:42.255
when-- talk about
a deus ex machina--

1:26:14.713 --> 1:26:18.713
So we just had a stabilizing problem
and the thing got a little off balance.

1:26:18.713 --> 1:26:22.713
And then the radio went glitchy, so I
just need to get down and use a phone.

1:26:22.713 --> 1:26:25.672
And thank you very much,
by the way, for stopping.

1:26:25.797 --> 1:26:28.672
My name's Don.

1:26:32.089 --> 1:26:34.089
And so Linda married.

1:26:34.089 --> 1:26:38.797
To a wonderful man who was not uptight
and repressed and accepted her...

1:26:38.797 --> 1:26:42.255
and even laughed at wild tales
of her promiscuous background.

1:26:42.255 --> 1:26:44.755
And so our little
Greek drama comes to--

1:26:44.755 --> 1:26:46.755
Wait, wait, wait.
There's more.

1:26:46.755 --> 1:26:49.755
What more, Tiresias,
blind seer of Thebes?

1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:52.256
Tell 'em just to
call me Tiresias, will ya?

1:26:52.381 --> 1:26:54.256
The handicapped
are always cranky.

1:26:54.256 --> 1:26:57.755
On that night,
Lenny Weinrib and Linda did make love,

1:26:57.755 --> 1:27:00.755
Iike he was Zeus and she
was Aphrodite with an aphrodisiac.

1:27:00.755 --> 1:27:02.755
Get to the point!

1:27:02.755 --> 1:27:06.047
- The point is, Linda did,
that night, conceive a child.
- No!

1:27:06.047 --> 1:27:09.464
Yes. She became pregnant
with Lenny's child.

1:27:09.546 --> 1:27:13.964
But not wanting to complicate his life
with Amanda, she never told him.

1:27:14.047 --> 1:27:16.922
Instead she went off
with her new husband,

1:27:17.047 --> 1:27:21.546
who stood behind her loyally as she
gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.

1:27:21.630 --> 1:27:23.546
Lenny never saw Linda again.

1:27:32.630 --> 1:27:36.005
We can look around the whole store
if you'd like.

1:27:38.130 --> 1:27:40.214
- Lenny!
- I don't believe this! Wh--

1:27:40.339 --> 1:27:42.922
-  Hi.
- What are you doing here?

1:27:42.922 --> 1:27:45.422
- I-I--
- I'm stunned! What happened to you?

1:27:45.422 --> 1:27:47.422
I-I'm living in Connecticut.

1:27:47.422 --> 1:27:50.422
I'm married and my husband Don
is a helicopter pilot.

1:27:50.422 --> 1:27:53.922
You're kidding! Where did you go?
I searched every place for you.

1:27:53.922 --> 1:27:57.880
- It's like you vanished
off the face of the earth.
- Well, we had our moment.

1:27:58.005 --> 1:28:01.880
- But I knew you
would be back with Amanda.
- I can't b-- That's super.

1:28:02.005 --> 1:28:05.381
- S-So y-you're married and--
This is yours?
- Yes! Look at her.

1:28:05.505 --> 1:28:08.672
Oh, God, she's adorable.

1:28:08.797 --> 1:28:10.880
- She's adorable. Very, very--

1:28:11.005 --> 1:28:13.880
- And is-- Is that Max?
- This is Max. This is Max.

1:28:13.964 --> 1:28:16.381
- Hello.
- Max, say hello. This is a friend.

1:28:16.464 --> 1:28:18.381
- Hi, I'm Linda.
- How do you do?

1:28:18.464 --> 1:28:21.588
What a handsome boy.
Amanda must be very beautiful.

1:28:21.588 --> 1:28:25.089
And she's-- You've gotta have
a very handsome husband,

1:28:25.089 --> 1:28:27.089
'cause she has a great face.

1:28:27.089 --> 1:28:30.089
I'm stunned.
I don't know what to say. I'm, I'm--

1:28:30.172 --> 1:28:34.047
- Lenny, it's so great to see you.
- You too. You're okay? Everything--

1:28:34.172 --> 1:28:36.547
Yeah. I'm really good.

1:28:36.672 --> 1:28:38.547
Thank you for everything.

1:28:38.672 --> 1:28:40.547
Oh-- I-I--
I'm speechless.

1:28:40.672 --> 1:28:44.047
I-I-- I gotta go.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna be late.

1:28:44.172 --> 1:28:48.339
- It was great to see you.
- It was great to see you. Great.

1:28:48.464 --> 1:28:51.339
- But they have each other's child.

1:28:51.464 --> 1:28:53.339
And they don't know.

1:28:53.464 --> 1:28:56.339
Yes. Yes. Isn't life ironic?

1:28:56.339 --> 1:28:58.339
Life is unbelievable.

1:28:58.339 --> 1:29:02.047
Miraculous. Sad.
Wonderful.

1:29:02.131 --> 1:29:04.422
Yes, this is all true!

1:29:04.547 --> 1:29:06.547
And that's why we say:
