00:40.789 --> 00:42.042
In five,

00:42.162 --> 00:44.578
four, three,

00:44.698 --> 00:45.951
two...

00:48.034 --> 00:49.235
Get down!

00:49.264 --> 00:51.481
- Get down on the ground!
- Down on the ground! Now!

00:51.496 --> 00:53.097
- On your knees!
- Get down!

00:53.106 --> 00:54.579
- OK, OK!
- Now!

00:54.700 --> 00:56.249
Hands on your head!

00:56.250 --> 00:57.450
Do it!

00:57.896 --> 00:59.097
Where is it?

00:59.098 --> 01:02.017
- Dunno what you're talking about.
- Bullshit. Search him.

01:07.659 --> 01:09.245
Negative. He doesn't have it.

01:09.245 --> 01:10.724
Find out if he ever did.

01:11.990 --> 01:14.391
- What the hell is that?
- Shut up!

01:16.951 --> 01:20.001
It reads 5.3 microelectron volts.

01:21.396 --> 01:22.944
Guess what, dickhead?

01:22.945 --> 01:25.594
- You're radioactive.
- We know you had the polonium.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.126
Now where is it?

02:33.496 --> 02:34.841
Bernard.

02:35.307 --> 02:37.028
Mon compčre !

02:39.623 --> 02:43.472
- How long has it been?
- July 1, 1994.

02:43.473 --> 02:45.552
- I still send him postcards.
- Oh, no!

02:45.554 --> 02:47.557
- Oh, you do?
- To decorate the inside

02:47.557 --> 02:49.574
of his jail cell over Christmas.

02:49.574 --> 02:53.483
1994. You're talking about Vladko
Vladic, the Bosnian war criminal?

02:53.891 --> 02:57.371
He was trying to get his hands
on a thermo-nuclear device.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.526
Until Bernard stopped him.

02:59.557 --> 03:02.423
And then Dorn nailed his ass to the wall.

03:04.045 --> 03:07.091
Christophe Bernard, Carine Strand.

03:07.235 --> 03:09.240
Your reputation precedes you.

03:09.259 --> 03:11.795
That was Carine's Cross Border Unit

03:11.924 --> 03:14.252
that caught that smuggler in Brussels.

03:14.805 --> 03:17.004
Bernard will lead our search for the

03:17.021 --> 03:20.432
- missing polonium.
- Monsieur Bernard, it's an honor.

03:21.704 --> 03:23.817
Well, let's get to it, shall we?

03:30.055 --> 03:33.069
Bridgewater nuclear plant
in southwest England.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.987
I've been to Bridgewater, it rained.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.778
They run their security
checks every two hours.

03:38.793 --> 03:41.091
At 6:03 this morning,

03:41.114 --> 03:43.037
the system alerted the staff that

03:43.051 --> 03:45.718
polonium 210 had gone missing

03:45.719 --> 03:47.127
from the laboratory.

03:47.197 --> 03:49.687
The most toxic substance on the planet.

03:50.009 --> 03:53.009
Million times more potent than cyanide.

03:53.010 --> 03:54.521
They've run through all their protocols,

03:54.531 --> 03:56.805
and they do believe
that it has been stolen.

03:58.387 --> 04:02.554
Bridgewater notified
Scotland Yard, MI5, MI6,

04:02.572 --> 04:04.141
and when that all came out blank,

04:04.223 --> 04:05.754
four hours later, they called us.

04:05.756 --> 04:07.566
I'm worried it might leave the country.

04:07.567 --> 04:09.844
With good reasons. As it turns out.

04:09.855 --> 04:11.450
How did you locate him?

04:11.451 --> 04:14.274
We checked for all known
smugglers leaving the UK,

04:14.360 --> 04:16.192
on trains, planes,

04:16.401 --> 04:19.562
headed for the United
States, Middle East, Europe.

04:19.886 --> 04:22.052
And the search threw up Enrico Fazio.

04:22.052 --> 04:25.057
He's a high-level smuggler.
He normally smuggles weapons.

04:25.112 --> 04:26.999
CCTV caught him boarding the Eurostar

04:27.000 --> 04:29.995
from London St. Pancras shortly after 5 am.

04:30.026 --> 04:31.745
He was carrying a small package.

04:31.757 --> 04:33.593
It fits the time of the robbery.

04:34.168 --> 04:36.692
And when you apprehended him in Brussels,

04:36.745 --> 04:39.425
his radiation levels were through the roof

04:39.425 --> 04:40.860
but he was empty-handed?

04:40.860 --> 04:42.680
We think he passed it on

04:42.682 --> 04:44.531
shortly before we found him.

04:46.338 --> 04:49.941
Spectrometer picks up nothing
in the surrounding area.

04:50.211 --> 04:52.473
Energy signature is masked.

04:52.485 --> 04:53.976
Whoever this is,

04:54.042 --> 04:56.430
definitely knows what he's doing.

04:56.745 --> 04:57.947
But,

04:58.279 --> 05:00.781
we understand the damage this could do.

05:00.805 --> 05:03.786
It's my understanding
polonium needs to be ingested

05:03.805 --> 05:06.247
- inhaled, or swallowed.
- Correct.

05:06.276 --> 05:08.329
But, even a grain of it, uh,

05:08.372 --> 05:10.480
would destroy your major organs,

05:10.480 --> 05:12.408
DNA, immune system.

05:12.749 --> 05:14.430
It's a slow

05:14.502 --> 05:17.370
- terrifying way to go.
- Regrettably,

05:17.555 --> 05:19.548
Bridgewater's presumption

05:19.817 --> 05:22.829
is that a good deal more
than that is gone missing.

05:22.858 --> 05:24.564
- How much?
- 3 grams.

05:25.910 --> 05:29.560
In the wrong hands, that
is enough to wipe out

05:29.579 --> 05:31.560
half a major city.

05:31.589 --> 05:34.415
- Where's your suspect?
- Just out of decontamination.

05:35.079 --> 05:37.606
So you picked up the polonium, in England,

05:37.608 --> 05:41.192
used whichever border guards on
your payroll to blag security.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.495
Nuclear shit? Me?

05:43.507 --> 05:47.567
You were in Brussels for 14 minutes,

05:47.591 --> 05:49.033
before we picked you up.

05:49.069 --> 05:50.715
What happened to the case you had?

05:50.738 --> 05:53.218
Must have dropped it while
you lot were chasing me.

05:53.218 --> 05:56.115
- Why run if you had nothing?
- I need the exercise.

05:57.353 --> 05:58.880
We could get some together, eh?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.125
Look,

06:00.507 --> 06:02.067
a hell of a lot of people are gonna die

06:02.069 --> 06:03.632
just 'cause you want to cover your ass.

06:03.632 --> 06:04.898
Fuck you!

06:05.622 --> 06:06.877
Not my problem.

06:07.918 --> 06:09.416
Just let me go.

06:11.456 --> 06:13.319
- Feeling all right?
- You don't look too well.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.377
Apart from the police
harassment, I'm all good.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.202
I had nothing on me.

06:18.264 --> 06:19.464
So you got nothing on me.

06:19.466 --> 06:22.206
Nothing but abnormally
high radiation levels.

06:23.869 --> 06:25.564
Never ceases to astound me.

06:25.565 --> 06:28.586
That son of a bitch would
willingly sacrifice lives,

06:28.586 --> 06:29.846
thousands of them,

06:29.994 --> 06:31.687
just to keep himself out of jail.

06:31.694 --> 06:33.139
We're wasting time.

06:33.175 --> 06:35.880
- Release him.
- He has information that we need.

06:35.899 --> 06:37.288
And you have zero proof.

06:37.293 --> 06:39.461
We'll let him stew for a
bit, we'll try again later.

06:39.470 --> 06:43.617
And next time say "pretty
please" with cherries on top?

06:52.509 --> 06:54.721
At 8:34

06:54.792 --> 06:57.548
Fazio arrived at Bruxelles-Midi,

06:58.209 --> 07:00.286
presumably with the polonium.

07:00.406 --> 07:03.718
After a 28 minute journey by helicopter

07:03.737 --> 07:07.812
you apprehend him, in Brussels, at 8:48.

07:07.879 --> 07:10.060
That is 14 minutes

07:10.069 --> 07:13.062
- after his arrival.
- My team responded appropriately.

07:13.064 --> 07:14.637
Given the circumstances.

07:14.793 --> 07:17.235
Obviously you were going
as fast as you could.

07:17.322 --> 07:18.521
Shame though,

07:19.086 --> 07:21.149
14 minutes faster,

07:21.487 --> 07:23.783
and this whole thing would be over.

07:23.850 --> 07:27.000
CCTV has him leaving the
platform with the case.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.290
So Fazio disposed of it,

07:29.298 --> 07:31.668
in or around the train station,

07:31.670 --> 07:34.132
in that 14 minute-window.

07:34.317 --> 07:37.923
We retraced his path from the train
station to where we picked him up.

07:37.927 --> 07:40.800
- Nothing dropped or stashed.
- We're working with the supposition

07:40.814 --> 07:42.468
that he passed it on to someone.

07:42.475 --> 07:46.060
Ellie and Sebastian have been
going through the station's CCTVs.

07:46.060 --> 07:47.261
Mm-hm.

07:47.468 --> 07:50.490
- How many cameras?
- Six down, seven to go, sir.

08:10.819 --> 08:12.019
Stop.

08:12.728 --> 08:14.136
Stop here.

08:15.769 --> 08:18.930
Wasn't Fazio wearing
a brown leather jacket?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.858
There, passing the bag to that woman.

08:22.031 --> 08:23.648
How long to ID her?

08:23.707 --> 08:27.096
If we run facial recognition
across all footage,

08:27.216 --> 08:28.939
seven, eight minutes, maybe.

08:28.981 --> 08:30.430
Come on, people.

08:30.466 --> 08:33.033
I'm an old man, with failing eyes.

08:33.260 --> 08:37.003
Our precious duet, can we
dispatch them to the chopper?

08:37.201 --> 08:39.254
To get a head start this time.

08:39.721 --> 08:41.121
Of course.

08:47.580 --> 08:48.779
Yes.

08:52.290 --> 08:54.302
- I'm fine.
- He's direct.

08:54.423 --> 08:56.224
And he will presume control.

08:56.344 --> 08:57.738
If he deems it necessary.

08:57.739 --> 09:00.067
Should I have had the
chopper, up in the air waiting?

09:00.073 --> 09:01.183
No.

09:01.187 --> 09:03.749
How could you ever know the
polonium would surface in Europe?

09:03.760 --> 09:06.341
Doesn't help that we need
Bernard to spot Fazio.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.136
He's renowned for a good reason.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.884
This is still your team.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.775
If he can help us find the polonium,

09:11.852 --> 09:13.068
that's all I care about.

09:21.623 --> 09:23.479
Come on, faster,

09:23.490 --> 09:24.955
or I'll trade you in.

09:25.884 --> 09:27.086
Got her.

09:27.087 --> 09:28.331
Where is that bus going?

09:28.350 --> 09:31.163
Brussels-Ličge, departed
1 hour 32 minutes ago.

09:31.176 --> 09:33.318
- What stops does it make?
- It's a direct shuttle

09:33.325 --> 09:35.698
but it has two more rest
stops: Hélécine and Waremme.

09:35.722 --> 09:37.500
We won't make Hélécine in time.

09:37.519 --> 09:39.782
- Waremme it is.
- I'll notify quarantine.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.831
Caren, you'll liaise with local police.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.072
- No uniforms of course.
- Of course.

09:44.124 --> 09:45.554
And it's Carine.

09:45.556 --> 09:47.123
It's one of those names.

09:47.515 --> 09:48.773
Oh, no.

09:48.774 --> 09:49.974
Children.

09:51.822 --> 09:54.908
_

09:54.909 --> 09:57.346
_

10:01.605 --> 10:03.072
Seconds away.

10:03.844 --> 10:05.621
Position check.

10:07.082 --> 10:08.340
In position.

10:09.623 --> 10:11.453
Where's the Hazmat team?

10:11.792 --> 10:13.283
En route.

10:38.719 --> 10:41.587
We've got visual. She's coming off the bus.

10:54.844 --> 10:57.129
Great. She's seen us.

10:58.292 --> 10:59.491
Move!

10:59.611 --> 11:01.753
- Move!
- Hey!

11:02.267 --> 11:04.533
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

11:09.350 --> 11:10.934
Stop the car!

11:11.341 --> 11:12.826
Stop the car!

11:28.722 --> 11:31.259
Hey! Hey! Get down!

11:31.379 --> 11:33.279
- Stop. Stop! Get down on the ground!

11:33.287 --> 11:34.948
- Get down on the ground!
- Down!

11:34.950 --> 11:36.317
- Down! Get down!
- Stay where you are!

11:36.332 --> 11:38.735
Hands on the ground! Nobody touch her!

11:39.385 --> 11:40.625
Down!

11:41.331 --> 11:43.022
Suspect secured.

11:43.597 --> 11:45.350
Where are the hazmats?

11:45.865 --> 11:48.289
Gounia, c'est Bernard.
Oů que c'est qu'ils sont ?

11:48.304 --> 11:49.764
Botte leur le cul, veux-tu ?

11:49.764 --> 11:50.923
***

11:50.923 --> 11:53.378
They're forty minutes away.

11:54.292 --> 11:56.633
Luke, quarantine is forty minutes away.

11:57.943 --> 12:00.346
- What? Still?
- Twenty, will a police escort.

12:00.352 --> 12:01.894
- On it.
- We can't wait!

12:01.917 --> 12:04.864
- Tell them to open it.
- Unprotected from the radiation? No.

12:04.879 --> 12:08.649
- We know the container is sealed.
- We know that it was.

12:08.659 --> 12:11.053
If the polonium is not in that bag,

12:11.062 --> 12:13.965
the man who has it is getting further away.

12:14.009 --> 12:15.604
Thousands at risk.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.864
- Simple equation.
- Bag secured.

12:18.778 --> 12:20.217
Arabela?

12:22.721 --> 12:24.143
Arabela, open the door.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.553
It's my turn or you'll
never shut up about it.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.173
- Get out of the car!
- Arabela?

12:30.196 --> 12:31.504
Get out of the car!

12:31.543 --> 12:32.830
Arabela!

12:32.860 --> 12:35.769
All right, this is what you signed up for.

12:35.784 --> 12:37.835
- Open the bag.
- Arabela, you don't have to do it.

12:37.856 --> 12:39.456
Get out of the car, Arabela.

12:39.481 --> 12:40.684
Arabela, open the door.

12:40.691 --> 12:42.421
- Open the bag.
- Arabela?

12:42.437 --> 12:45.323
- This is a direct order!
- Arabela, don't do it!

12:45.336 --> 12:47.215
Don't! Just open the door!

12:52.753 --> 12:54.663
- Fridge magnets.
- What?

12:55.014 --> 12:57.602
Confirming: the bag is a decoy,

12:57.697 --> 12:58.914
over.

13:01.917 --> 13:04.111
Your team must have missed something.

13:04.298 --> 13:07.841
Do I need to go through
all the CCTV myself?!

13:23.436 --> 13:24.943
Another dead end.

13:26.219 --> 13:27.942
She's trained to know nothing.

13:28.062 --> 13:30.134
And Hazmat says she's clean.

13:30.403 --> 13:32.110
No radiation exposure?

13:32.128 --> 13:34.635
Whoever Fazio gave the
polonium to, it wasn't her.

13:34.636 --> 13:37.163
Well that was just a decoy to
distract us from the real bag.

13:37.163 --> 13:39.009
Looks like an old smuggler's manoeuvre,

13:39.010 --> 13:41.215
to throw interested parties off the scent.

13:41.225 --> 13:45.118
And while every passing second
nears nuclear catastrophe,

13:45.147 --> 13:47.831
the ICC's elite investigators

13:47.861 --> 13:51.437
are drinking their lattes
with chocolate sprinkles.

13:51.557 --> 13:54.246
We do not need a reminder of the
time constraint, Monsieur Bernard.

13:54.259 --> 13:56.432
So, what are we waiting for?

13:56.690 --> 13:59.653
We all know Fazio gave the 210 to someone.

13:59.655 --> 14:02.068
I've watched every last frame of the CCTV,

14:02.070 --> 14:04.744
there was no sign of Fazio
interacting with anyone.

14:04.761 --> 14:07.003
So, girl, boys,

14:07.283 --> 14:10.691
a round of applause to Fazio, magician.

14:11.282 --> 14:13.149
He made the 210

14:14.034 --> 14:15.298
disappear.

14:15.943 --> 14:17.865
I don't have to listen to this shit.

14:18.811 --> 14:20.254
We'll keep looking.

14:21.490 --> 14:22.692
It's OK.

14:44.222 --> 14:46.633
- Hello?
- Arabela, can you do something for me?

14:46.634 --> 14:47.834
Sure.

14:48.376 --> 14:51.419
I need you to check out Brussels Souvenirs.

14:57.561 --> 14:58.760
So,

14:58.761 --> 15:02.169
let me get this right. You can
risk your life, but I can't?

15:02.171 --> 15:04.700
I'm just saying, I prefer some
kind of a discussion first.

15:04.730 --> 15:08.489
Like when you jumped in front of a
moving vehicle without warning me first?

15:09.278 --> 15:10.695
- Double standards.
- Well, sue me

15:10.696 --> 15:12.198
for having my partner's back.

15:14.157 --> 15:15.356
Hello.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.850
Inspector Arabela Seeger with the ICC.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.427
Do you recognize this woman?

15:23.717 --> 15:26.047
This bag, you sold any recently?

15:26.167 --> 15:29.794
- Yes, just this morning.
- And, what about this man?

15:30.452 --> 15:31.679
Yes, to him.

15:32.248 --> 15:33.792
He left without taking his change.

15:33.816 --> 15:36.270
- Did you see him interact with anybody?
- No.

15:36.918 --> 15:38.514
Can you tell us what time he was here?

15:38.514 --> 15:40.394
Sure. Just a second.

15:40.421 --> 15:42.897
Here... 11:14.

15:47.135 --> 15:48.837
That is not good.

15:49.998 --> 15:52.114
Fazio bought four of the same bags,

15:52.131 --> 15:53.975
and every fridge magnets they had,

15:53.993 --> 15:56.165
slapped on 200 and walked.

15:56.177 --> 15:58.349
He hands the four identical
bags to couriers...

15:58.374 --> 16:00.368
Only one of them contained the polonium.

16:00.385 --> 16:03.509
It's a precision operation
designed to drain our resources.

16:03.525 --> 16:05.058
Seńor Fazio

16:05.082 --> 16:09.315
you certainly accomplished a lot
in that 14 minutes we allowed you.

16:10.164 --> 16:12.407
So, we need to establish

16:12.660 --> 16:14.754
which of the bags has the polonium.

16:15.390 --> 16:17.450
So that we can eliminate the other three.

16:17.475 --> 16:20.821
Locating any of the bags
at this stage, would be

16:20.863 --> 16:23.125
something of an accomplishment.

16:25.399 --> 16:27.537
Excellent work. Keep me informed.

16:30.179 --> 16:32.116
- You're still there?
- Yes, still here.

16:32.128 --> 16:34.125
Good. I want to try something.

16:34.355 --> 16:36.594
We're just outside the
shop. What do you need?

16:36.840 --> 16:39.234
We know Fazio was there, right?

16:39.403 --> 16:41.985
I want to retrace the route he
would have taken from the station.

16:41.986 --> 16:44.717
- En route. What are we looking for?
- Keep going.

16:45.533 --> 16:47.604
There should be a pedestrian walkway.

16:47.643 --> 16:48.932
To our right.

16:48.932 --> 16:50.292
Keep going.

16:54.235 --> 16:55.905
- Yes.
- What is it?

16:55.941 --> 16:59.053
- I lost you on the CCTV.
- And that's a good thing, Tech Support?

16:59.077 --> 17:00.903
It is if you see a camera anywhere.

17:00.903 --> 17:02.402
Private security footage.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.442
- Got one!
- Use your famous English charm

17:06.442 --> 17:08.329
and maybe they'll let you take a look.

17:18.214 --> 17:19.450
There he is.

17:20.387 --> 17:23.114
And we didn't have this hours ago, because?

17:23.115 --> 17:25.068
Until Carine identified
the souvenirs' shop,

17:25.077 --> 17:26.614
we didn't have Fazio's route.

17:29.034 --> 17:31.112
- Look.
- Wait, freeze.

17:31.557 --> 17:33.247
One of those men has the hot bag.

17:33.248 --> 17:35.692
Now we just have to ID and find him.

17:35.693 --> 17:38.423
- Already on it.
- Very good.

17:47.219 --> 17:50.595
Sebastian is running facial
recognition on the couriers at the café.

17:50.628 --> 17:53.794
Two of them are in the criminal
database as known associates of Fazio.

17:53.827 --> 17:55.576
They will be difficult to track.

17:55.615 --> 17:58.559
Marco, Luke and Arabela are out
there trying to find him now.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.323
Every police bureau across
Europe has been fully briefed.

18:01.342 --> 18:02.634
And third man?

18:02.682 --> 18:05.872
His face wasn't fully to camera.
We got, ah, a partial profile,

18:05.881 --> 18:08.040
he's distinctive, Sebastian's hopeful.

18:08.065 --> 18:09.832
Well, you are making progress.

18:09.833 --> 18:11.071
Not fast enough.

18:18.173 --> 18:19.374
What's wrong?

18:19.913 --> 18:21.113
Not here.

18:24.056 --> 18:25.256
What do you have?

18:25.798 --> 18:27.762
That Hazmat team that was a no-show... ?

18:27.781 --> 18:29.907
- Yeah.
- I called them like you asked.

18:29.916 --> 18:31.775
Good. They give a reason for the screw up?

18:34.390 --> 18:35.701
Well, here's the thing:

18:35.869 --> 18:37.569
it wasn't them who screwed up.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.521
They were told to go to the
service station in Hélécine.

18:40.522 --> 18:41.722
Not Waremme.

18:41.723 --> 18:42.923
By Bernard.

18:44.231 --> 18:45.432
You're certain?

18:45.874 --> 18:48.509
He directed them to the wrong place.

18:49.063 --> 18:50.748
And he was there when we said Waremme.

18:50.762 --> 18:51.970
It was very clear.

18:52.164 --> 18:55.493
- You've got to pull him out on this.
- What good would it do? He made a mistake.

18:55.494 --> 18:57.305
That could have cost the
lives of Arabela, and Luke,

18:57.306 --> 18:59.281
- and everyone else for miles away!
- I know that!

18:59.282 --> 19:00.278
It's kinda hard to forgive

19:00.282 --> 19:02.238
- given the perfection he demands!
- Stop!

19:03.868 --> 19:05.075
OK.

19:06.403 --> 19:07.819
If we hit back

19:07.901 --> 19:09.429
it could start a war.

19:09.692 --> 19:11.789
That would jeopardize the investigation.

19:11.790 --> 19:12.990
So that's it?

19:14.467 --> 19:15.666
We just let it go.

19:18.714 --> 19:20.414
Anything on the third courier?

19:31.835 --> 19:35.445
Enhanced and mirrored the image to
recreate the other side of his face.

19:35.447 --> 19:36.655
Nice. Any hits?

19:36.675 --> 19:39.577
Cross-refed against the
database, but came up blank.

19:39.587 --> 19:41.729
Looks like he's got no criminal record.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.827
Carine? This man...

19:44.817 --> 19:46.785
William Mason, plant coordinator.

19:48.846 --> 19:51.836
Scotland Yard cleared all
suspects at the Bridgewater plant,

19:51.844 --> 19:54.909
with the opportunity and
know-how to extract polonium 210.

19:54.913 --> 19:57.440
- He has no technical skills.
- Hence they ruled him out.

19:57.445 --> 19:58.663
What makes him interesting?

19:58.663 --> 20:01.373
Well, he travelled in Belgium
twice in the past month.

20:02.816 --> 20:04.372
That is interesting.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.867
Get this information to Marco.

20:09.413 --> 20:10.866
Nice work, Ellie.

20:11.769 --> 20:14.432
_

20:14.432 --> 20:16.462
_

20:16.463 --> 20:19.319
Hold still, back, and swing through.

20:20.487 --> 20:23.665
Not bad, darling. Not bad. OK, Jack?

20:25.085 --> 20:26.653
William Mason?

20:26.893 --> 20:28.269
Bill, normally.

20:28.275 --> 20:30.003
Inspector Marco Costante.

20:30.005 --> 20:31.204
ICC.

20:35.284 --> 20:38.900
So, you're aware of what happened
at the nuclear plant this morning?

20:39.019 --> 20:41.055
Phone's been ringing off the hook.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.634
No one can believe it.

20:42.755 --> 20:46.069
The entry logs state you were at the plant

20:46.080 --> 20:49.775
and with the access to the laboratory
at the time the polonium was stolen.

20:50.601 --> 20:52.660
You can't seriously think...

20:56.822 --> 20:58.594
Yes, I was there.

20:59.322 --> 21:02.255
But what use would I
have with polonium 210?

21:02.865 --> 21:06.278
- In any case, I don't have the training.
- Well, you worked there a long time.

21:06.480 --> 21:09.443
Irradiating bismuth with
high energy neutrons

21:09.469 --> 21:11.856
isn't an act you pick-up along the way.

21:12.162 --> 21:15.089
You travelled in Belgium
twice in the past month.

21:15.297 --> 21:18.474
And we know the stolen goods were
smuggled into Belgium this morning.

21:18.857 --> 21:20.300
Is that just a coincidence?

21:20.488 --> 21:21.744
Yes, it is.

21:22.137 --> 21:24.771
I go to Belgium periodically
to visit a friend.

21:24.892 --> 21:27.148
- What friend?
- John Korsten.

21:27.346 --> 21:29.906
He worked at the plant
until he took redundancy.

21:29.919 --> 21:32.271
And you've been to visit him... twice,

21:32.288 --> 21:35.347
- in the last four weeks?
- Johnny's in ill-health.

21:35.693 --> 21:37.513
And we don't know how long he has left.

21:37.559 --> 21:39.619
And as he has no family...

21:41.074 --> 21:45.838
Look, I can assure you, I have nothing
to do with any nuclear terrorism.

21:47.028 --> 21:48.830
You should go back to your kids.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.842
Good luck, finding who's behind this.

22:02.663 --> 22:06.119
Find out everything you
can about a John Korsten.

22:06.689 --> 22:10.048
Former employee at
Bridgewater alongside Mason.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.933
Now a resident of Belgium.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.132
Give me a minute.

22:19.924 --> 22:21.338
That's him.

22:23.980 --> 22:25.663
The third man.

22:26.643 --> 22:28.086
Monsieur Bernard?

22:28.095 --> 22:32.202
- Korsten, the courier we couldn't ID.
- What was Korsten's job?

22:32.203 --> 22:33.409
Technical engineer.

22:33.410 --> 22:35.682
OK, would he be capable
of extracting the polonium?

22:35.704 --> 22:37.913
Yes. Of course.

22:37.927 --> 22:40.291
That is, if we ignore the fact

22:40.322 --> 22:42.806
that he hasn't worked
at the plant for years.

22:42.857 --> 22:46.345
Mason's taken two trips to Belgium
a month for the past year and a half.

22:46.388 --> 22:48.454
He definitely had the opportunity.

22:50.768 --> 22:52.938
What if Korsten was teaching him

22:52.960 --> 22:54.605
how to extract the polonium?

22:54.726 --> 22:57.142
That's why Mason's been going to Belgium,

22:57.358 --> 22:58.669
for lessons.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.152
Mason steals the polonium,

23:01.166 --> 23:02.828
he gives it to Fazio, Fazio

23:02.857 --> 23:04.582
smuggles it across to Korsten.

23:04.990 --> 23:07.769
Sebastian, get Luke and
Arabela, they need to abort

23:07.788 --> 23:09.428
the search for the other couriers.

23:09.711 --> 23:10.912
Sir?

23:11.122 --> 23:14.000
The police have just advised
me that they had spotted

23:14.000 --> 23:17.011
one of the other couriers
at the German border.

23:17.023 --> 23:19.143
- I won't close the door on that.
- No.

23:19.166 --> 23:21.191
Sir, all of our resources

23:21.213 --> 23:24.500
have to be devoted to
Korsten. He's got hours on us.

23:24.506 --> 23:26.284
I've heard nothing conclusive.

23:26.314 --> 23:29.078
What about Mason and Korsten's motive?

23:29.090 --> 23:30.443
I'll find out.

23:32.826 --> 23:35.170
Well, when that time
comes, we'll know whether

23:35.175 --> 23:39.511
- to drop our other two suspects.
- With all due respect, sir,

23:39.632 --> 23:41.892
there are no other suspects.

23:41.903 --> 23:44.465
- Korsten has the polonium.
- You don't know that.

23:44.496 --> 23:46.507
Yes, sir, I do.

23:46.626 --> 23:49.727
There are two couriers with
no connection to the plant,

23:49.727 --> 23:53.307
and one whose best friend was
in the laboratory this morning.

23:53.324 --> 23:56.753
Chasing around after two more decoy
bags is exactly what they want us to do.

23:56.778 --> 23:58.580
I'll take your input under advisement.

23:58.582 --> 24:00.334
Monsieur Bernard, that is not good enough.

24:00.346 --> 24:02.662
We need to concentrate on Korsten.

24:02.781 --> 24:07.951
If you cannot follow orders,
I will have you dismissed!

24:10.844 --> 24:14.339
Include Korsten in the manhunt as you wish,

24:14.352 --> 24:16.799
but my orders as of now,

24:16.825 --> 24:20.398
are to keep tracking all three couriers.

24:27.613 --> 24:29.026
This is madness.

24:29.092 --> 24:31.395
I don't care how brilliant
Bernard is supposed to be, but,

24:31.420 --> 24:33.719
he's just mad that we
figured it out despite him.

24:33.970 --> 24:36.529
He just said it himself,
thousands of lives at stake.

24:36.832 --> 24:41.182
We can't afford to risk splitting our
manpower just to satisfy an old man's ego.

24:53.538 --> 24:55.557
The best friend a guy can have.

24:56.430 --> 24:58.315
What does he want, Daddy?

24:58.345 --> 25:02.205
Thirty-six trips to Brussels in
the last eighteen months, Mr. Mason.

25:02.654 --> 25:04.926
- Get in the car. All of you.
- Yes.

25:07.790 --> 25:09.712
I know you took the polonium.

25:10.071 --> 25:12.792
- That's ludicrous.
- Your friend, Korsten, had the expertise

25:12.794 --> 25:15.076
to extract the polonium. He taught you how.

25:15.082 --> 25:18.009
Believe me, Johnny's been in no
condition to teach me anything.

25:18.021 --> 25:20.111
No one suspected the, uh,

25:20.230 --> 25:22.451
unequipped plant coordinator.

25:22.571 --> 25:24.421
You were able to steal the polonium,

25:24.432 --> 25:27.252
and give it to Fazio, before
anyone notice it was gone.

25:32.682 --> 25:35.143
Can we not do this in front of my children?

25:39.160 --> 25:40.447
Fazio,

25:41.410 --> 25:42.817
god awful man.

25:43.361 --> 25:46.012
Johnny insisted on using him because of his

25:46.199 --> 25:47.785
connections at Customs.

25:48.115 --> 25:51.612
OK, the only piece of this I
can't put together is... why?

25:51.833 --> 25:53.167
It's not what you think.

25:53.755 --> 25:56.191
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

25:58.060 --> 25:59.694
Back when Johnny worked at the plant,

25:59.694 --> 26:01.819
the equipment fell into disrepair.

26:02.048 --> 26:04.531
Cracks in pressurized teeter sleeves,

26:04.652 --> 26:07.530
- corrosion of reactors...
- Weren't there inspections?

26:07.579 --> 26:09.429
It got swept under the carpet.

26:10.182 --> 26:12.410
They kept saying repairs are coming,

26:12.584 --> 26:13.905
upgrades...

26:15.318 --> 26:17.666
Then faulty equipment caused a fire.

26:18.538 --> 26:20.877
They were stuck in the reactor for hours.

26:21.529 --> 26:24.396
- Exposed to radioactive isotopes.
- Who's "they"?

26:24.415 --> 26:26.122
Five people on Johnny's team.

26:27.726 --> 26:29.414
He's the only one still alive.

26:29.444 --> 26:32.605
And they all died as a result
of the radiation exposure?

26:33.041 --> 26:36.596
All five killed by cancer
before they reach fifty.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.345
Quite a coincidence.

26:42.606 --> 26:45.277
The plant's owners denied culpability.

26:45.396 --> 26:47.167
Blamed it on human error.

26:47.424 --> 26:49.385
Johnny tried everything.

26:49.778 --> 26:52.648
- The newspaper even had the whole story.
- And?

26:54.699 --> 26:56.907
They refused to publish at the last minute.

26:57.403 --> 26:59.953
What does Korsten intend
to do with the polonium?

26:59.953 --> 27:02.612
To show people how unsafe the plant is.

27:02.804 --> 27:05.359
He thought if people could
see how easy it was to,

27:05.365 --> 27:08.442
steal something as deadly
pol 210, they'd demand

27:08.472 --> 27:10.346
accountability for what happened.

27:10.365 --> 27:12.780
But if going public was his intention

27:13.555 --> 27:15.003
he would have done it by now.

27:19.732 --> 27:21.713
I think Korsten lied to you.

27:34.656 --> 27:35.856
So,

27:36.226 --> 27:38.051
what you are saying is that

27:38.057 --> 27:40.464
you will have to disobey Bernard's orders.

27:40.471 --> 27:41.537
To save lives.

27:41.542 --> 27:43.422
You cannot trust him to bring this home.

27:43.422 --> 27:45.625
His achievements are
worthy of great esteem.

27:45.643 --> 27:47.432
What he is doing here is not.

27:47.635 --> 27:49.934
His natural instincts remain sound,

27:49.964 --> 27:53.036
he picked that man out of the
crowd when none of us could.

27:53.342 --> 27:56.509
But there is an inability to
follow lateral trains of thoughts.

27:57.096 --> 27:59.759
He lashes out at people failing memory.

27:59.771 --> 28:00.974
Yes.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.819
Yes, I... I saw some of that.

28:06.647 --> 28:07.853
Sad.

28:09.182 --> 28:11.174
Getting old is not funny.

28:13.155 --> 28:15.077
I don't take this lightly.

28:15.329 --> 28:17.867
Oh, I don't for a moment
presume that you do.

28:20.208 --> 28:21.728
You are certain, yes?

28:21.729 --> 28:22.887
Right now,

28:22.888 --> 28:26.371
on his orders, Luke and Arabela
are out there, chasing down suspects

28:26.372 --> 28:28.673
that we know don't have the polonium.

28:30.337 --> 28:33.510
- Well, I will speak with him.
- I'd rather that you didn't.

28:33.865 --> 28:35.376
I wanted you to know.

28:36.576 --> 28:39.073
- You're his friend.
- He is my responsibility.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.355
I will handle it.

28:41.115 --> 28:42.316
All right.

28:43.096 --> 28:44.296
Thank you.

28:45.309 --> 28:48.048
I mean, what is important, what matters,

28:49.077 --> 28:50.926
is that we save lives.

28:55.616 --> 28:56.892
Carine?

28:58.070 --> 28:59.829
Remember what I said,

29:00.208 --> 29:01.751
this is your team.

29:14.604 --> 29:16.028
This is it.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.115
Very good you two.

29:23.374 --> 29:25.917
- We got him.
- How long was I gone?

29:25.930 --> 29:30.217
One hundred threatening emails from Korsten

29:30.328 --> 29:32.083
to the Hele Wereld,

29:32.202 --> 29:34.442
this Brussels-based newspaper.

29:34.442 --> 29:37.835
That must be the newspaper that
had the story and then killed it.

29:37.840 --> 29:41.247
Korsten's anger at them,
his fury... we got him.

29:42.229 --> 29:44.730
Notify the newspaper, and start

29:44.748 --> 29:46.546
evacuation procedures.

29:47.173 --> 29:50.364
Notify the Feds, and mobilize your team

29:50.369 --> 29:51.806
to secure the newspaper.

29:51.817 --> 29:53.829
Shouldn't we consider
other possible targets

29:53.854 --> 29:55.842
before committing of all resources?

29:55.846 --> 29:57.965
Two years of threatening emails,

29:57.971 --> 30:00.964
- it's not enough for you?
- If he's this angry

30:00.994 --> 30:03.755
at the newspaper, imagine how he must feel

30:03.789 --> 30:05.744
about the people who caused the death

30:05.746 --> 30:08.102
- of his friends. The owners of the plant.
- Such as?

30:08.121 --> 30:09.615
The people who did the safety checks,

30:09.615 --> 30:12.990
- the inspectors who overlooked...
- Nuclear catastrophe is imminent,

30:13.000 --> 30:16.761
and unless you have something
more to offer than speculation,

30:17.015 --> 30:18.758
mobilize your team,

30:18.791 --> 30:21.941
and secure the God damn newspaper!

30:23.722 --> 30:24.923
Yes, sir.

30:30.025 --> 30:31.503
Do as he says.

30:31.699 --> 30:33.164
But get Marco back here.

30:33.285 --> 30:37.576
Alert the local police, and divert
Luke and Arabela to Korsten's home.

30:37.779 --> 30:39.525
And find me something else.

30:42.048 --> 30:44.484
_

30:44.486 --> 30:47.461
_

30:47.796 --> 30:50.273
KORSTEN'S HOME, Belgium

31:10.567 --> 31:11.961
Mr. Korsten?

31:14.272 --> 31:17.111
Mr. Korsten, it's the police.
We need to talk to you.

31:43.292 --> 31:44.492
Clear.

31:44.824 --> 31:46.023
Clear.

31:46.251 --> 31:48.256
Not exactly a hoarder, is he?

31:48.704 --> 31:49.904
No.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.204
Hey.

32:21.378 --> 32:23.192
Schematics.

32:25.334 --> 32:28.027
Diagnostics. Some kind of building.

32:29.505 --> 32:30.824
IVE.

32:31.759 --> 32:32.974
"IVE"?

32:38.587 --> 32:40.738
_

32:42.497 --> 32:46.366
IVE, corporation in the
Brussels business district.

32:47.684 --> 32:49.955
I'll get you the coordinates now.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.097
What else do we know?

33:11.434 --> 33:14.112
Turns out the Bridgewater
plant was sold three years ago.

33:14.113 --> 33:15.287
Yep, they owned four plants

33:15.288 --> 33:17.785
before getting out of nuclear
power with a giant profit.

33:18.075 --> 33:20.881
Are there any personnel
remaining from that time?

33:20.891 --> 33:22.115
You could say that.

33:22.125 --> 33:25.709
IVE's CEO earned his stripes as
section chief of their nuclear arm.

33:25.738 --> 33:29.618
So he controlled the Bridgewater
nuclear plant while Korsten worked there?

33:29.621 --> 33:30.961
Yeah, affirmative.

33:32.598 --> 33:36.107
OK, Brussels business
district. Let's go! Punch it!

33:46.820 --> 33:48.137
What have you got?

33:48.819 --> 33:50.050
It's a map.

33:52.278 --> 33:53.846
Yeah, but a map of what?

33:54.320 --> 33:57.148
These, they don't look like streets.

33:57.950 --> 33:59.150
No.

34:00.396 --> 34:01.989
This is underground.

34:04.250 --> 34:07.527
Schematics of the tunnel
system underneath the city.

34:07.715 --> 34:10.670
They run right underneath
the IVE headquarters.

34:11.059 --> 34:13.161
Is that Korsten's way into the building?

34:14.478 --> 34:16.927
Uh, Monsieur Bernard? Monsieur Bernard?

34:16.927 --> 34:18.166
The police want to know,

34:18.168 --> 34:21.094
what are the most likely ways for
Korsten to deploy the polonium?

34:21.108 --> 34:22.835
I've told them this.

34:23.159 --> 34:27.036
It has to be ingested. For a
building the size of a newspaper,

34:27.036 --> 34:30.507
- air conditioning, or the water supply.
- Thank you, sir.

34:30.851 --> 34:32.925
He's going for their water supply.

34:33.297 --> 34:34.496
Shit.

34:38.581 --> 34:40.429
He's going for the water supply.

34:42.420 --> 34:44.175
You're about to hit traffic.

34:44.485 --> 34:46.012
You're better off on foot.

34:57.161 --> 35:00.730
Better get moving. The building is
two blocks south of your position.

35:07.233 --> 35:08.923
Mon équipe est sur les lieux.

35:08.938 --> 35:11.215
Elle procčdera ŕ l'arrestation. Over.

35:11.909 --> 35:14.115
How far are they from the newspaper?

35:14.161 --> 35:17.161
Carine's going straight through
to voicemail, sir, same with Marco.

35:17.161 --> 35:18.677
It must be the signal.

35:22.615 --> 35:24.233
Where are they?

35:26.697 --> 35:29.478
IVE HEADQUARTERS - Brussels, Belgium

35:38.494 --> 35:40.148
Sebastian, talk to me.

35:40.447 --> 35:42.887
Take the parking ramp, down to sub level 3.

35:43.452 --> 35:44.652
There.

35:45.699 --> 35:49.907
You do know it's a crime to withhold
information during an investigation?

35:49.909 --> 35:51.565
Didn't think you wanted to hear it, sir.

35:51.565 --> 35:53.907
if you're wrong and people die...

35:53.960 --> 35:57.114
the world... fault... Get them again.

35:57.163 --> 35:58.554
They're underground.

35:58.753 --> 36:00.083
Well, try again.

36:00.085 --> 36:01.900
Sorry, there's no signal,
they're underground.

36:01.900 --> 36:05.666
Stuff you can do on this thing, and
you can't get a phone call through?

36:18.000 --> 36:21.144
- Access to the water supply?
- Up here, to the right.

36:41.887 --> 36:43.090
Go.

36:50.905 --> 36:52.679
- Come on, connect.
- _

36:54.565 --> 36:56.255
- Yes.
- _

37:16.034 --> 37:17.588
I wouldn't come any closer.

37:17.588 --> 37:20.023
OK, get your hands up in the
air where we can see them.

37:20.038 --> 37:22.327
I suggest you leave
now if you want to live.

37:22.605 --> 37:24.005
You got visual?

37:25.329 --> 37:26.829
Take the shot.

37:32.086 --> 37:33.389
Johnny?

37:33.865 --> 37:35.065
It's OK.

37:35.094 --> 37:36.748
We just want to talk to you.

37:37.664 --> 37:39.503
Seems I have their attention.

37:40.001 --> 37:41.275
Yes.

37:41.559 --> 37:43.072
Yes, you do.

37:43.802 --> 37:45.208
There was a time

37:45.329 --> 37:46.996
when I wanted to talk.

37:48.253 --> 37:50.865
Now I've settled on a more direct approach.

38:02.164 --> 38:04.797
What are you waiting for, Inspector? Shoot!

38:04.797 --> 38:07.507
The polonium is too
close to the water supply.

38:07.528 --> 38:09.443
I know what happened
to you and your friends.

38:09.498 --> 38:10.992
Do you? Fuck!

38:10.994 --> 38:13.597
We know everything, I spoke to Bill.

38:14.210 --> 38:15.759
What do you know?

38:17.346 --> 38:19.090
You know about Ida Sharp,

38:19.322 --> 38:21.177
mother of three boys,

38:21.992 --> 38:23.831
dead at 48?

38:24.686 --> 38:26.677
How about Nick Osbourne,

38:26.797 --> 38:28.496
worked here three months,

38:28.615 --> 38:30.503
dead at 52.

38:30.650 --> 38:32.809
- Terrible thing.
- You know about this?

38:34.235 --> 38:36.003
Elizabeth Fry,

38:36.704 --> 38:38.228
Paul Samson,

38:38.688 --> 38:40.117
Aziz Kahn... ?

38:40.132 --> 38:41.927
- You're getting this?
- Yeah.

38:41.942 --> 38:43.333
All dead.

38:44.186 --> 38:46.251
- All murdered.
- We'll help.

38:46.297 --> 38:48.945
Bring those responsible to justice.

38:49.065 --> 38:51.927
It's too late. It's too fucking late!

38:56.128 --> 38:58.036
They killed my team,

38:58.822 --> 39:00.492
they killed the story,

39:00.844 --> 39:02.938
and they made one mistake.

39:03.978 --> 39:06.373
They didn't kill me fast enough.

39:06.568 --> 39:08.925
You won't get another chance.

39:09.045 --> 39:11.677
Take the God damn shot!

39:13.300 --> 39:17.117
I'm ordering you to take the shot, now!

39:17.880 --> 39:19.572
I'm not taking the shot.

39:20.132 --> 39:22.108
Because he's not going through with it.

39:25.670 --> 39:27.061
What happened?

39:27.637 --> 39:29.599
What the hell happened?

39:29.822 --> 39:31.599
You wanna make your point.

39:32.233 --> 39:33.639
I get that.

39:34.418 --> 39:36.164
You want justice.

39:38.621 --> 39:40.291
It's not gonna happen here.

39:40.804 --> 39:42.436
I'll go to my death,

39:42.842 --> 39:44.092
clinging,

39:44.211 --> 39:46.456
to the happy thought of their suffering.

39:46.710 --> 39:49.501
328 people in this building.

39:51.141 --> 39:53.922
How many of them are responsible
for what happened to you?

39:54.277 --> 39:58.047
You'll be killing hundreds
of innocent people.

39:58.713 --> 40:02.833
Secretaries, accountants,
the cleaning staff.

40:06.307 --> 40:07.887
The good people.

40:08.432 --> 40:10.347
Just like your friends.

40:11.463 --> 40:13.362
They don't deserve this.

40:14.664 --> 40:16.507
Just like you didn't.

40:18.548 --> 40:19.985
You will

40:20.277 --> 40:21.594
be heard.

40:23.001 --> 40:24.833
Not like this.

41:00.190 --> 41:01.510
It's over.

41:01.617 --> 41:03.487
Jesus Christ.

41:51.376 --> 41:52.576
Hey.

41:59.099 --> 42:00.454
Thank you.

42:06.648 --> 42:10.822
Good to see that someone's
judgement remains sound.

42:13.798 --> 42:15.778
You made the right choice.

42:16.686 --> 42:18.324
Hell of a last job.

42:18.362 --> 42:19.563
Last?

42:20.181 --> 42:21.731
I don't want to, ah,

42:22.067 --> 42:23.918
outstay my welcome.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.871
In my report,

42:26.990 --> 42:29.909
I will make it clear I lost control.

42:30.836 --> 42:33.478
Thank you, for your service,

42:33.597 --> 42:35.130
Monsieur Bernard.

42:35.724 --> 42:36.925
Good night.

42:36.927 --> 42:39.121
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Mm-hmm.

42:43.585 --> 42:45.748
Your lights will never dim...

42:45.867 --> 42:47.364
they may have to

42:47.393 --> 42:50.184
drag you out of here, Dorn.

42:50.626 --> 42:51.826
But,

42:51.936 --> 42:55.385
I'm celebrating my retirement.

42:55.407 --> 42:56.936
Celebrating?

42:57.532 --> 43:00.010
Oh no!

43:00.646 --> 43:06.242
So that means, that I
will have to buy. Oh God!

43:09.954 --> 43:13.851
Erik's pretending to be asleep, while
secretly watching movies on his phone.

43:13.873 --> 43:15.798
Well, a chip of the old block.

43:21.931 --> 43:23.293
You're staring.

43:24.228 --> 43:25.429
Huh?

43:25.695 --> 43:27.157
Nothing.

43:28.860 --> 43:30.463
Listen, um,

43:30.521 --> 43:32.429
I respect what you said the other day.

43:32.474 --> 43:35.858
Certain things you
might have a point about.

43:36.275 --> 43:38.661
- You smashed it today, mate.
- Oh yeah?

43:38.713 --> 43:42.894
- Yeah. Best damn IT department in town.
- Cheers to that.

43:47.557 --> 43:49.757
She never talks about herself.

43:50.335 --> 43:54.599
You know? Normally, all that time
spent together, you find out... stuff.

43:54.606 --> 43:56.942
- What stuff?
- Dunno, like...

43:58.378 --> 44:01.065
Like, has she got a boyfriend, you know?

44:01.079 --> 44:02.362
Arabela?

44:02.987 --> 44:05.556
No. No boyfriend.

44:09.182 --> 44:10.579
Thank you.

44:17.635 --> 44:19.110
So, um,

44:20.351 --> 44:22.460
I just wanted to say that, um,

44:23.500 --> 44:26.365
you are up there.

44:26.690 --> 44:28.222
Up where?

44:28.432 --> 44:30.617
One of the best people
I've ever worked with.

44:30.646 --> 44:32.405
You're not too bad yourself.

44:37.510 --> 44:38.878
Oh...

44:39.440 --> 44:42.050
Look, this probably isn't the, uh, most

44:42.101 --> 44:43.998
professional thing that I've ever done,

44:44.219 --> 44:46.135
but, um...

44:46.914 --> 44:49.152
Yeah, I just wanted to
know if you, maybe...

44:49.152 --> 44:50.858
One second. Just one second.

44:50.916 --> 44:52.016
Hi.

44:54.244 --> 44:55.697
I'm... I'm OK.
