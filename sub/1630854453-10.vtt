The L Word: Generation Q...</i>

00:06.673 --> 00:09.342
<i>I'd like another chance
to get better at this.</i>

00:09.342 --> 00:10.927
<i>My mom died.</i>

00:10.927 --> 00:13.513
<i>I can't do anything that's
too real right now.</i>

00:13.513 --> 00:16.099
God, I love you.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.518
<i>Call me when that heart heals.
I'll come running.</i>

00:18.518 --> 00:20.145
<i>Let's just cancel the finale.</i>

00:20.145 --> 00:21.980
<i>It's not fucking worth it.</i>

00:21.980 --> 00:23.857
<i>What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna make a fucking show.</i>

00:23.857 --> 00:25.900
<i>Piddles!</i>

00:25.900 --> 00:28.737
<i>My cat is stuck in a tree.</i>

00:28.737 --> 00:30.030
<i>Hi, Alice.
- Thank you very much,</i>

00:32.699 --> 00:34.200
<i>That's the guy, that's her ex.</i>

00:34.200 --> 00:36.036
<i>Hey! Get away from my daughter!</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:38.413
<i>Can you believe how wrong they
all are about the situation?</i>

00:38.413 --> 00:39.414
<i>They're right.</i>

00:39.414 --> 00:41.207
<i>He has all the power.</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:43.084
<i>I still really want
to be friends.</i>

00:43.084 --> 00:44.210
<i>I'm still in love with you.</i>

00:44.210 --> 00:45.920
<i>So, no dice for now.</i>

00:45.920 --> 00:48.423
<i>Why do you get
to make up all the rules?</i>

00:48.423 --> 00:49.758
<i>You get to fuck whoever
you want.</i>

00:49.758 --> 00:51.509
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

00:52.927 --> 00:55.055
<i>"I am grateful for my donor."</i>

00:55.055 --> 00:56.056
<i>Donor for what?</i>

00:56.056 --> 00:57.057
<i>Baby.
- Baby.</i>

00:58.767 --> 01:00.143
<i>I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.</i>

01:00.143 --> 01:01.227
Same.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.896
<i>I love you.</i>

01:02.896 --> 01:04.064

01:16.034 --> 01:18.078
<i>Doesn't get better than this</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:19.913
<i>We got the cake
right here, Alice.</i>

01:19.913 --> 01:21.414
<i>Oh, great, thanks so much.
- You want it in the fridge?</i>

01:21.414 --> 01:23.208
<i>Um, yeah, the walk-in fridge
will be great.</i>

01:23.208 --> 01:24.417
<i>I did it, I got the cake.
- You want these on the tables?</i>

01:24.417 --> 01:25.835
<i>I don't know about weddings.</i>

01:25.835 --> 01:27.754
Don't ask me questions.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.589
<i>Two hours till guests arrive.
- Thanks. Why am I doing this?</i>

01:29.589 --> 01:32.092
<i>Where is the wedding planner?</i>

01:32.092 --> 01:34.260
<i>Morphine candy, baby</i>

01:34.260 --> 01:35.470
<i>You're the one...</i>

01:35.470 --> 01:36.721
Tristan for Kimmy?

01:36.721 --> 01:38.098
<i>Go for Kimmy,
go for Kimmy.</i>

01:38.098 --> 01:39.140
Can you come to the garden?

01:39.140 --> 01:40.934
<i>No, I can't, I'm reading emails.</i>

01:40.934 --> 01:43.394
<i>Heart's on fire,
you're under my gun</i>

01:43.394 --> 01:45.480
<i>I hope that you're ready</i>

01:45.480 --> 01:47.107
<i>Hi, there.
- Hi.</i>

01:47.107 --> 01:48.608
<i>This is actually empty,
but if you want to go</i>

01:48.608 --> 01:50.276
<i>just across the property,
there's another bathroom</i>

01:50.276 --> 01:52.278
<i>just past the big tree,
keep walking, you can't miss it.</i>

01:52.278 --> 01:53.571
<i>That's a pretty dress.</i>

01:53.571 --> 01:54.989
<i>Beautiful.
- Yeah. Nice color.</i>

01:54.989 --> 01:56.282
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

01:56.282 --> 01:57.492
<i>Okay, clear.</i>

01:57.492 --> 01:59.619
<i>Can you understand me</i>

01:59.619 --> 02:01.121
<i>Speaking in tongues...</i>

02:03.373 --> 02:04.624
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

02:06.626 --> 02:08.294
<i>Let me be your doctor</i>

02:08.294 --> 02:10.421
<i>I promise I can help you...</i>

02:10.421 --> 02:12.090
<i>Oh, my God, you're so hot.</i>

02:12.090 --> 02:13.633
<i>Oh, God. Don't look at me.</i>

02:14.884 --> 02:17.303
<i>Sorry I'm wearing
hippie deodorant.</i>

02:19.806 --> 02:20.890
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

02:20.890 --> 02:23.643
<i>Electrocute me</i>

02:23.643 --> 02:25.436
<i>Show me you can</i>

02:25.436 --> 02:28.439
<i>Light me up inside
using your hands</i>

02:28.439 --> 02:29.774
<i>I know that it's scary</i>

02:29.774 --> 02:31.943
<i>But, baby, be bad for me</i>

02:31.943 --> 02:34.779
<i>Did you, um, put the favors</i>

02:34.779 --> 02:36.656
<i>in the center of the table, like
right there by the entrance?</i>

02:36.656 --> 02:37.991
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:37.991 --> 02:39.659
<i>You know,
I just want to make sure</i>

02:39.659 --> 02:40.994
<i>everybody knows to grab them
when they're walking out.</i>

02:40.994 --> 02:42.495
<i>They'll know.</i>

02:42.495 --> 02:43.621
<i>Do you think the heat
is on in here?</i>

02:43.621 --> 02:44.706
<i>It's like so hot.</i>

02:44.706 --> 02:46.374
<i>Does this open?
-</i>

02:46.374 --> 02:47.792
<i>There's no latch.</i>

02:47.792 --> 02:49.961
<i>Oh, my God, it doesn't open.</i>

02:49.961 --> 02:51.838
<i>I'm hot. Are you hot?</i>

02:51.838 --> 02:54.549
<i>You think maybe it's possible
that you're having a hot flash?</i>

02:54.549 --> 02:56.676
<i>Ugh, what? No.</i>

02:56.676 --> 02:58.136
<i>I can't be.</i>

02:58.136 --> 03:00.013
<i>I-I think the heat's on
in there.</i>

03:00.013 --> 03:01.431
<i>Here, come get
a glass of water.</i>

03:01.431 --> 03:02.849
<i>No, I...</i>

03:02.849 --> 03:04.684
<i>I'm done with all that, right?</i>

03:04.684 --> 03:06.769
<i>Happy wedding day.</i>

03:06.769 --> 03:08.354
<i>Wow, you look amazing.</i>

03:08.354 --> 03:09.439
<i>Really? Thanks.</i>

03:09.439 --> 03:10.690
<i>Yeah, I thought so, too.</i>

03:10.690 --> 03:11.941
<i>I couldn't decide
on a dress, but...</i>

03:11.941 --> 03:13.193
Oh, I can see that.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.694
<i>So you got a twofer.
- I did.</i>

03:14.694 --> 03:16.529
<i>Um, listen, good news.</i>

03:16.529 --> 03:18.781
<i>The cake has arrived.</i>

03:18.781 --> 03:21.201
<i>It is here. My job is done.</i>

03:21.201 --> 03:22.327
Thanks for handling that.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.536
<i>Yeah.
- And the booze.</i>

03:25.038 --> 03:26.539
<i>The...?</i>

03:26.539 --> 03:28.499
<i>You were responsible for
the cake and the booze.</i>

03:28.499 --> 03:29.876
<i>Cake and the booze, I know.
- Yeah.</i>

03:29.876 --> 03:32.003
<i>Tina, I almost finished
your sentence.</i>

03:32.003 --> 03:33.463
<i>The cake and booze.
I've been saying it all week.</i>

03:33.463 --> 03:35.048
Ugh, I'm burning up.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.507
<i>Oh, my God. I'm burning up.</i>

03:36.507 --> 03:38.384
<i>The heat's on in here.
I just know it.</i>

03:38.384 --> 03:40.720
<i>Can you see my sweat...
-</i>

03:40.720 --> 03:42.096
<i>...through this shirt?
- You know what?</i>

03:42.096 --> 03:43.765
<i>Why don't we--
- This is a nightmare.</i>

03:43.765 --> 03:45.266
<i>Come on, let's go find a place
for you to cool off.</i>

03:45.266 --> 03:46.893
<i>Good idea.
I think the walls in here...</i>

03:46.893 --> 03:48.394
<i>It's gonna be such a great day.</i>

03:48.394 --> 03:49.771
<i>...are just
starting to close in.</i>

03:49.771 --> 03:51.731
<i>I-I saw an ice machine
down the hall.</i>

03:51.731 --> 03:53.524
I have a better idea.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.568
<i>Fuck me. Okay...</i>

03:55.568 --> 03:58.738
<i>Oh, my God. How am I...?</i>

03:58.738 --> 03:59.781
<i>Hi. Oh, hi.</i>

03:59.781 --> 04:00.990
<i>How are you?
- Great.</i>

04:00.990 --> 04:02.784
<i>What?
- Bad news.</i>

04:02.784 --> 04:04.702
<i>Already?
- Yeah. No alcohol.</i>

04:04.702 --> 04:06.287
<i>Wasn't that your job?</i>

04:06.287 --> 04:08.581
<i>Yeah, but... Actually,
why wasn't it your job?</i>

04:08.581 --> 04:09.666
<i>You own a bar.</i>

04:09.666 --> 04:11.000
<i>Because I did their hair.</i>

04:11.000 --> 04:13.002
<i>Well, that's true, I guess.
- Yeah.</i>

04:13.002 --> 04:14.337
<i>Hey.
- Hey.</i>

04:14.337 --> 04:15.755
<i>Hi.
- Hi to you.</i>

04:15.755 --> 04:17.340
<i>Hello to you.
- Yeah.</i>

04:17.340 --> 04:18.925
<i>Uh, thank you so much
for your help back there.</i>

04:18.925 --> 04:20.260
<i>Absolutely.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

04:20.260 --> 04:21.928
<i>I mean,
I'm a Capricorn moon, so...</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:23.429
<i>I love to serve.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

04:23.429 --> 04:24.847
<i>Pragmatic.
- Absolutely.</i>

04:24.847 --> 04:26.557
<i>You might want to...
- Oh, fuck.</i>

04:26.557 --> 04:28.184
<i>That's, uh...
- Anyway, I want to</i>

04:28.184 --> 04:30.186
<i>double-check with that.
- Sorry, hold on. Yeah, yeah?</i>

04:30.186 --> 04:31.854
<i>The fucking roses
keep stabbing me.</i>

04:31.854 --> 04:33.106
<i>Okay, there's no need to pop
an attitude, Tristan.</i>

04:33.106 --> 04:34.899
<i>Busy?
- I wasn't the one who was</i>

04:34.899 --> 04:36.276
<i>supposed to de-thorn the roses.
Okay, you know what?</i>

04:36.276 --> 04:37.443
<i>I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

04:37.443 --> 04:38.778
Yeah, come now.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.447
<i>Just keep coming all day.
Uh-huh. Yep.</i>

04:41.447 --> 04:45.034
<i>So you did the hair and
you did the wedding planner.</i>

04:46.744 --> 04:47.912
<i>Okay.</i>

04:47.912 --> 04:49.122
<i>I hate to tell you this.</i>

04:49.122 --> 04:50.456
<i>What?
- We have to call Tess.</i>

04:50.456 --> 04:51.916
<i>I don't think so,</i>

04:51.916 --> 04:52.959
<i>I haven't spoken to her
since she threw</i>

04:52.959 --> 04:54.419
<i>a bottle at my fucking head.</i>

04:54.419 --> 04:56.296
<i>Okay. It is Bette and Tina's
wedding day.</i>

04:56.296 --> 04:58.589
<i>There is no champagne
for the toast.</i>

04:58.589 --> 05:00.800
<i>There is no Aperol
for an Aperol spritz.</i>

05:00.800 --> 05:05.138
<i>Shane, you got to call her,
I'm sorry.</i>

05:05.138 --> 05:07.682
<i>I wanna push it</i>

05:07.682 --> 05:11.060
<i>I'm out here pushing,
pushing all my limits</i>

05:11.060 --> 05:15.481
<i>You're gettin' started
when I'm at the finish...</i>

05:17.567 --> 05:19.652
<i>All your talk is cheap</i>

05:19.652 --> 05:21.738
<i>So come on over here...</i>

05:21.738 --> 05:23.323
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

05:24.115 --> 05:28.786
<i>You keep on talkin' talkin',
all your talk is cheap</i>

05:28.786 --> 05:31.956
<i>So come on over here
and prove yourself to me...</i>

05:32.957 --> 05:34.459
<i>Hey.</i>

05:34.459 --> 05:36.336
<i>Hi.
- I was hoping that was you.</i>

05:36.336 --> 05:37.920
Yeah...

05:39.547 --> 05:41.007
You, uh...

05:41.007 --> 05:43.009
<i>You got to come over
to see the new place.</i>

05:43.009 --> 05:44.177
<i>I would love that.</i>

05:44.177 --> 05:45.303
<i>Yeah?
- Yes.</i>

05:45.303 --> 05:46.637
<i>It's a sublet.</i>

05:46.637 --> 05:47.847
<i>Because I don't know
about school yet,</i>

05:47.847 --> 05:48.848
<i>so it's not perfect.</i>

05:48.848 --> 05:50.475
<i>That's okay.</i>

05:50.475 --> 05:52.352
<i>Like you got to clap before
you go into the bathroom</i>

05:52.352 --> 05:55.396
<i>because there's...
So the roaches scatter.</i>

05:55.396 --> 05:56.814
<i>You're-you're joking, right?</i>

05:56.814 --> 05:58.691
No. And the stove doesn't work.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.026
<i>How are you gonna eat, sweetie?</i>

06:00.026 --> 06:01.486
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

06:01.486 --> 06:02.612
<i>I'm gonna go get my toaster
from Sophie's.</i>

06:02.612 --> 06:03.946
<i>It's a good one, multifunctional.</i>

06:03.946 --> 06:06.449
<i>I don't have any furniture really.</i>

06:06.449 --> 06:08.284
<i>It's kind of bare bones
in there.</i>

06:08.284 --> 06:09.744
<i>I don't have any...</i>

06:09.744 --> 06:11.120
<i>I have to get all new stuff.</i>

06:11.120 --> 06:13.456
<i>Oh, no. You're sad. I'm sorry.</i>

06:13.456 --> 06:15.541
<i>Hey. You okay?
-</i>

06:15.541 --> 06:17.794
<i>Ugh, I just can't believe that
this is my life right now.</i>

06:17.794 --> 06:19.754
<i>Okay, well, fuck Shane.</i>

06:19.754 --> 06:21.506
<i>You don't have to say that,
I know that you love her.</i>

06:21.506 --> 06:24.008
<i>No, I don't, I love you.</i>

06:25.009 --> 06:26.052
<i>Come here.</i>

06:26.052 --> 06:28.054
<i>You're so cute.</i>

06:28.054 --> 06:30.848
<i>You want to come stay
at mine for a while?</i>

06:30.848 --> 06:33.226
<i>Mm, no, the roaches were not
a good selling point. No.</i>

06:33.226 --> 06:36.145
But I'm gonna be there.

06:39.190 --> 06:43.403
<i>Oh. Um... It's Shane.</i>

06:45.405 --> 06:47.407
<i>Basically,
they told you they love you</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:49.575
<i>and you ghosted them.</i>

06:49.575 --> 06:53.204
<i>Oh. Look at that, the flower
budget very high, huh?</i>

06:53.204 --> 06:55.581
<i>Yeah. It's really good.
- How the hell did they</i>

06:55.581 --> 06:56.874
<i>pull this big-ass wedding off?</i>

06:56.874 --> 06:58.084
<i>Well, everybody did something.</i>

06:58.084 --> 06:59.585
<i>Oh.
- I found the place.</i>

06:59.585 --> 07:01.254
<i>You did?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.</i>

07:01.254 --> 07:02.630
<i>I know the family
who owns the property.</i>

07:02.630 --> 07:03.673
<i>Oh, who owns it?</i>

07:03.673 --> 07:04.966
<i>Okay, so--
- D-Bag!</i>

07:04.966 --> 07:06.676
<i>Hi, babe!</i>

07:06.676 --> 07:07.802
<i>Hi.
-</i>

07:07.802 --> 07:08.970
<i>Yeah, that makes sense.</i>

07:08.970 --> 07:10.430
<i>Oh.</i>

07:10.430 --> 07:12.014
<i>Damn, Soph, you look hot.
- Doesn't she?</i>

07:12.014 --> 07:14.058
<i>Good. I'm trying to get laid
tonight, so...</i>

07:14.058 --> 07:16.769
<i>Oh, shit. There's Alice.
Hide me, hide me, hide me.</i>

07:16.769 --> 07:18.688
<i>Hide me, hide me.
- She's not gonna fire you.</i>

07:18.688 --> 07:20.565
<i>Well, she hasn't spoken to me
in, like, two weeks.</i>

07:20.565 --> 07:21.691
<i>You're on hiatus.</i>

07:21.691 --> 07:24.235
<i>I aired the finale without her.</i>

07:24.235 --> 07:25.611
<i>And you fucking
crushed it, okay?</i>

07:25.611 --> 07:27.613
<i>I did. I did do that, didn't I?</i>

07:27.613 --> 07:29.740
<i>You did.
- If she does fire you,</i>

07:29.740 --> 07:31.617
<i>I can get you a gig as an
adventure guide in Costa Rica.</i>

07:31.617 --> 07:33.744
<i>It's a fucking blast.
- Oh, my God.</i>

07:33.744 --> 07:36.122
<i>You're so funny. Thank you.</i>

07:36.122 --> 07:38.207
<i>Yeah.
- Okay, you know what?</i>

07:38.207 --> 07:39.625
<i>I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Do it.</i>

07:39.625 --> 07:41.294
<i>Wish me luck.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

07:41.294 --> 07:43.087
<i>Go get 'em.
- Going.</i>

07:43.087 --> 07:44.964
<i>Let's get something to drink.</i>

07:44.964 --> 07:47.091
<i>Oh, there's, uh, no booze here.
- There's no booze?</i>

07:47.091 --> 07:50.428
<i>No, but, uh...</i>

07:50.428 --> 07:52.972
<i>I got molly.</i>

07:52.972 --> 07:54.307
<i>Oh, uh, no.</i>

07:54.307 --> 07:55.808
<i>No, no, molly
doesn't work on me.</i>

07:55.808 --> 07:58.144
<i>Oh, well, no harm in trying.</i>

07:58.144 --> 07:59.562
<i>Come on.</i>

07:59.562 --> 08:00.980
<i>Why are you like this?</i>

08:00.980 --> 08:02.648
<i>You'll love it. Do it.</i>

08:02.648 --> 08:04.233
<i>I've got a feeling...</i>

08:04.233 --> 08:06.319
<i>Mmm.
- That's nasty.</i>

08:06.319 --> 08:07.695
<i>Ugh.</i>

08:07.695 --> 08:09.280
<i>Give me that. Please?</i>

08:09.280 --> 08:10.781
<i>Sorry.
- I'm going, I'm going.</i>

08:10.781 --> 08:12.450
<i>I want to spit it out. Ugh.</i>

08:12.450 --> 08:15.036
<i>They won't believe it
when it comes</i>

08:15.036 --> 08:16.579
<i>Ugh.</i>

08:16.579 --> 08:18.414
<i>All I ever needed was
to give it...</i>

08:18.414 --> 08:19.415
Let's party.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.921
<i>Mm, this feels amazing.
Oh, my God.</i>

08:24.921 --> 08:29.050
<i>Wow, I got to hand it to you.</i>

08:29.050 --> 08:32.303
<i>The walk-in fridge, good idea.
That was brilliant.</i>

08:32.303 --> 08:34.013
<i>Oh, good.</i>

08:34.013 --> 08:35.973
<i>My next plan was to put
a fan next to the ice sculpture,</i>

08:35.973 --> 08:38.976
<i>like DIY a whole air
conditioner, or something.</i>

08:38.976 --> 08:40.520
<i>This is working.</i>

08:40.520 --> 08:42.146
<i>Yeah, I feel better already.</i>

08:42.146 --> 08:43.731
<i>Good.</i>

08:45.358 --> 08:46.609
<i>Am I being a monster?</i>

08:46.609 --> 08:47.693
<i>No, no.</i>

08:47.693 --> 08:49.362
<i>I wouldn't use that word.</i>

08:49.362 --> 08:51.697
<i>You just seem... stressed.</i>

08:51.697 --> 08:53.115
<i>We-we didn't have
a big wedding before.</i>

08:53.115 --> 08:54.325
<i>I know.</i>

08:54.325 --> 08:55.368
<i>We just went to the courthouse.</i>

08:55.368 --> 08:57.328
<i>Yeah, that was fun, too.</i>

08:57.328 --> 08:59.038
<i>But our friends were pissed.</i>

08:59.038 --> 09:00.957
<i>It's not about them.
- It is.</i>

09:00.957 --> 09:04.627
<i>They have been on this
very long journey with us.</i>

09:04.627 --> 09:09.131
<i>And I want them to see us
happy, like this.</i>

09:09.131 --> 09:11.133
<i>Okay, when you put it
that way, yes.</i>

09:11.133 --> 09:12.885
<i>Yes, I want that for them, too.</i>

09:12.885 --> 09:14.345
<i>Good.</i>

09:15.596 --> 09:17.265
<i>You ready?
- Yeah.</i>

09:17.265 --> 09:19.267
<i>I am very ready.</i>

09:21.686 --> 09:22.937
<i>Come on.</i>

09:27.108 --> 09:28.943
Let me...

09:28.943 --> 09:30.570
<i>This handle.</i>

09:30.570 --> 09:33.281
<i>Let me just... Oh!</i>

09:33.281 --> 09:34.532
<i>Oh, shit. Oh, my God.
- Oh, no.</i>

09:34.532 --> 09:35.992
<i>Oh, my God, no.</i>

09:35.992 --> 09:37.451
<i>Oh, here, you know what?
I got it, I got it.</i>

09:37.451 --> 09:39.328
<i>Oh, shit. Okay.
- I'm just gonna put-- first,</i>

09:39.328 --> 09:40.621
<i>let's just... [groans]</i>

09:40.621 --> 09:42.290
<i>Oh, fuck. Okay.</i>

09:42.290 --> 09:44.792
<i>Wait, turn it, turn it...
Like punch it again.</i>

09:44.792 --> 09:46.377
<i>Oh, my God.
- Oh, it's in.</i>

09:46.377 --> 09:48.004
<i>It's in, it's gonna open.
- Nope.</i>

09:48.004 --> 09:49.005
<i>Shit.</i>

09:49.005 --> 09:50.006
<i>Hello?</i>

09:50.006 --> 09:51.424
<i>Hey, we're in here!</i>

09:51.424 --> 09:52.508
<i>Hello?</i>

09:52.508 --> 09:54.051
<i>Watching you die</i>

09:54.051 --> 09:55.845
<i>With my own eyes</i>

09:55.845 --> 09:57.930
<i>How will you last...</i>

09:57.930 --> 10:00.850
<i>Thank God for Tess.
Um, question.</i>

10:00.850 --> 10:02.935
<i>There's like a lot of tequila,
right? It's not just one?</i>

10:02.935 --> 10:04.437
<i>Okay, 'cause it's like
a hundred people.</i>

10:04.437 --> 10:05.438
<i>Hey, Alice.
- You can go over there.</i>

10:05.438 --> 10:06.772
<i>Thank you.</i>

10:06.772 --> 10:08.858
<i>Hi.
- Ugh.</i>

10:08.858 --> 10:10.568
<i>Hi, Alice.
I know you can hear me.</i>

10:10.568 --> 10:12.445
<i>Oh, my God.
- Hi.</i>

10:12.445 --> 10:15.114
<i>I... didn't hear you, Sophie.</i>

10:15.114 --> 10:16.616
<i>That's... I...
It's like a wedding</i>

10:16.616 --> 10:18.534
<i>and it's loud and it's...
- Okay, listen.</i>

10:18.534 --> 10:20.328
<i>I know you've been avoiding me</i>

10:20.328 --> 10:22.246
<i>and if I did a shit job
with the show, you can tell me.</i>

10:22.246 --> 10:23.623
<i>Really, it's fine.</i>

10:23.623 --> 10:24.832
<i>All right, let's talk
about it, Sophie.</i>

10:24.832 --> 10:27.126
<i>Let's just lay it all out.</i>

10:27.126 --> 10:29.253
<i>By the cheese.</i>

10:29.253 --> 10:32.089
<i>Um, the network called me.</i>

10:32.089 --> 10:35.551
<i>And they loved the finale.</i>

10:36.719 --> 10:40.139
<i>They want to promote you,
Sophie. Next season.</i>

10:40.139 --> 10:42.141
<i>What?
- Do you see your face?</i>

10:42.141 --> 10:44.602
<i>Do you see the shock that you're
feeling? Can you imagine me?</i>

10:44.602 --> 10:47.647
<i>When I picked up the phone
and I was like, "Uh..."</i>

10:47.647 --> 10:50.316
<i>It was like that times a
hundred, but yet here we are.</i>

10:50.316 --> 10:53.736
<i>Yeah, okay, I get that you're
still pissed about me</i>

10:53.736 --> 10:54.737
<i>airing the show without you.</i>

10:54.737 --> 10:55.821
<i>It wasn't my favorite.</i>

10:55.821 --> 10:57.698
<i>But I'm glad it was a success</i>

10:57.698 --> 11:00.910
<i>because I would never
want to let you down.</i>

11:02.536 --> 11:04.580
<i>That's a really nice way
to put it.</i>

11:06.874 --> 11:07.917
<i>So...</i>

11:07.917 --> 11:10.461
<i>So...?</i>

11:10.461 --> 11:12.213
<i>Are we good?</i>

11:14.465 --> 11:16.425
<i>Yeah, we're... Yeah, we're good.</i>

11:16.425 --> 11:19.303
<i>Just was getting really used
to being mad at you.</i>

11:19.303 --> 11:21.597
<i>Oh, this is great.</i>

11:21.597 --> 11:23.307
<i>I was just so worried
I was gonna have to spend...</i>

11:23.307 --> 11:25.017
<i>Alice!
- Oh, my God! Shut up!</i>

11:25.017 --> 11:28.062
<i>...this entire wedding
drinking my feelings, you know?</i>

11:28.062 --> 11:31.899
<i>But now I can just focus on
having fun</i>

11:31.899 --> 11:33.859
<i>and getting fucked, you know?</i>

11:33.859 --> 11:35.194
<i>Getting laid...</i>

11:35.194 --> 11:37.655
<i>Oh, now I'm just
talking to myself.</i>

11:37.655 --> 11:39.532
<i>Great.</i>

11:39.532 --> 11:41.867
<i>Well, if it makes you feel
any better, I was listening.</i>

11:41.867 --> 11:43.244
Oh...

11:43.244 --> 11:47.873
<i>Um... well, woof,
I'm just embarrassed.</i>

11:47.873 --> 11:51.252
<i>No, no. No, actually, weddings
are great places to get laid.</i>

11:51.252 --> 11:53.713
<i>So, I think your goal
is achievable.</i>

11:53.713 --> 11:56.382
<i>Oh. Do you?</i>

11:56.382 --> 11:58.634
<i>Pippa Pascal.</i>

12:00.261 --> 12:01.971
<i>Sophie Suarez.</i>

12:01.971 --> 12:03.723
<i>Hey, Soph. Hi.
- Hi.</i>

12:03.723 --> 12:05.725
You look great. Wow.

12:05.725 --> 12:06.892
<i>Thanks.</i>

12:06.892 --> 12:09.687
<i>Good luck.
- What? Uh...</i>

12:09.687 --> 12:12.314
<i>Oh, shit, were you two like...</i>

12:12.314 --> 12:14.066
<i>No.</i>

12:14.066 --> 12:16.569
<i>Okay, real quick, um,
I'm gonna need my toaster back.</i>

12:16.569 --> 12:17.820
<i>What toaster?</i>

12:17.820 --> 12:19.155
<i>The toaster in the bungalow.</i>

12:19.155 --> 12:21.073
<i>That's not your toaster.
- Yes, it is.</i>

12:21.073 --> 12:23.492
<i>No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is. I picked it out.</i>

12:23.492 --> 12:25.161
<i>And I paid for it.</i>

12:25.161 --> 12:27.413
<i>No, we-we split it.</i>

12:27.413 --> 12:29.832
<i>Okay, then why don't you just
get your own damn toaster?</i>

12:29.832 --> 12:31.208
<i>Because I want my toaster.</i>

12:31.208 --> 12:33.127
<i>Okay.
- Look, this is what I'm-a do.</i>

12:33.127 --> 12:34.795
<i>I'm gonna send you
my new address.</i>

12:34.795 --> 12:36.630
<i>You do the right thing</i>

12:36.630 --> 12:38.299
<i>and you're gonna drop it off
at your earliest convenience.</i>

12:38.299 --> 12:39.717
<i>Oh, am I?
- Or I'll pick it up.</i>

12:39.717 --> 12:43.304
<i>You know, either way.</i>

12:45.806 --> 12:47.808
<i>gentle music</i>

12:53.022 --> 12:55.316
<i>Ooh, you know what?
I like "Rafael."</i>

12:55.316 --> 12:56.650
<i>Ooh, "Raph" for short?</i>

12:56.650 --> 12:58.444
<i>I was thinking something
more androgynous.</i>

12:58.444 --> 13:00.738
<i>You know, I had a Postmate
the other day named Orion, so...</i>

13:00.738 --> 13:04.867
<i>You want our kid to be named
after a Postmates guy?</i>

13:04.867 --> 13:06.285
<i>I mean, the food was on time.</i>

13:06.285 --> 13:07.703
<i>You're ridiculous.</i>

13:07.703 --> 13:09.205
<i>Here you go, little fella.</i>

13:09.205 --> 13:12.583
<i>You do realize it's not
a baby yet, right?</i>

13:12.583 --> 13:14.293
<i>Well, I mean, it will be.</i>

13:14.293 --> 13:16.253
<i>Eventually.
Can you, can you believe that?</i>

13:16.253 --> 13:17.755
<i>What?
- It goes from a canister</i>

13:17.755 --> 13:20.132
<i>to a baby in nine months.
- No shit.</i>

13:20.132 --> 13:22.301
<i>And, well, technically ten
with the gestation,</i>

13:22.301 --> 13:23.803
<i>give or take.
- You know,</i>

13:23.803 --> 13:25.971
<i>I keep having these
little daydream moments</i>

13:25.971 --> 13:27.306
<i>of all of us together.</i>

13:27.306 --> 13:28.641
<i>Same. Oh, my God,</i>

13:28.641 --> 13:29.725
<i>I can totally picture us
in the kitchen</i>

13:29.725 --> 13:31.060
<i>baking Christmas cookies.</i>

13:31.060 --> 13:32.478
<i>Oh, I know.
- Making a mess.</i>

13:32.478 --> 13:34.313
<i>I, like, want to give them
little baths.</i>

13:34.313 --> 13:36.398
<i>Oh, me, too.
Their little tummies.</i>

13:36.398 --> 13:37.900
<i>Oh, my God, yes.</i>

13:37.900 --> 13:39.860
<i>Here we go.</i>

13:39.860 --> 13:42.488
<i>Okay. Ooh, the big reveal.</i>

13:42.488 --> 13:44.281
<i>It's finally happening.
- Here we go.</i>

13:44.281 --> 13:45.324
<i>Come on. Almost there.</i>

13:45.324 --> 13:47.284
<i>Ooh.
- Dad's coming.</i>

13:47.284 --> 13:49.495
<i>Oh, my God, it's a magic show.</i>

13:49.495 --> 13:51.705
<i>Ta-da!
-</i>

13:51.705 --> 13:52.873
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

13:52.873 --> 13:54.834
<i>We're really doing this.</i>

13:54.834 --> 13:57.044
<i>There you are.
- Oh. Moment of truth.</i>

13:57.044 --> 13:58.963
<i>Oh.
- Huh.</i>

13:58.963 --> 14:00.548
<i>It's, uh, it's blue. [chuckles]</i>

14:00.548 --> 14:03.634
<i>We really paid $700 for that?</i>

14:03.634 --> 14:05.094
<i>Is there enough?</i>

14:05.094 --> 14:06.804
<i>Honestly? I don't think so.</i>

14:06.804 --> 14:08.597
<i>You want to warm it up?
- Yeah.</i>

14:08.597 --> 14:10.224
<i>We have to.</i>

14:10.224 --> 14:11.684
<i>Here you go.
- Thank you.</i>

14:11.684 --> 14:13.602
<i>Got it? Okay.
- Yep.</i>

14:13.602 --> 14:15.688
<i>It looks like Gatorade.
-</i>

14:17.022 --> 14:18.274
<i>Let's see what we got.</i>

14:18.274 --> 14:19.942
<i>Oh, love instructions.</i>

14:19.942 --> 14:22.862
What else is in here?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.029
<i>How many pages are these?</i>

14:24.029 --> 14:26.198
<i>Insemination syringes.
- Okay...</i>

14:28.492 --> 14:29.660
<i>Oh, what is that?</i>

14:29.660 --> 14:33.038
<i>Catheter.
- Okay.</i>

14:33.038 --> 14:35.374
This is a lot of stuff.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.876
<i>Like this thing.</i>

14:36.876 --> 14:39.044
<i>What is this even for?</i>

14:39.044 --> 14:40.880
<i>whimsical music</i>

14:40.880 --> 14:42.214
<i>Hey!</i>

14:42.214 --> 14:44.383
<i>Working it</i>

14:44.383 --> 14:46.677
<i>You got it, you got it</i>

14:46.677 --> 14:48.679
<i>You're listening</i>

14:48.679 --> 14:50.890
<i>This is it,
you're feeling it</i>

14:50.890 --> 14:52.558
<i>Don't fight the beaters out</i>

14:52.558 --> 14:54.435
<i>You gotta free them now</i>

14:54.435 --> 14:56.228
<i>Kick off your shoes,
you know...</i>

14:56.228 --> 14:58.063
<i>Josh,
take that cart to the back.</i>

14:58.063 --> 15:00.190
<i>Go clean it and make sure that
the other bar is stocked.</i>

15:00.190 --> 15:02.276
<i>No problem.
- Thank you.</i>

15:05.529 --> 15:06.864
<i>Hi.</i>

15:08.449 --> 15:09.408
<i>Hi.</i>

15:11.201 --> 15:13.829
<i>I'm sorry you had to come
and do this last-minute.</i>

15:13.829 --> 15:17.416
<i>Don't be. I'm happy to help.</i>

15:18.584 --> 15:20.002
<i>Can I get you a beer
or something?</i>

15:20.002 --> 15:21.003
<i>Okay.</i>

15:21.003 --> 15:22.963
<i>Thank you.</i>

15:26.091 --> 15:28.010
<i>You don't have to worry.</i>

15:28.010 --> 15:30.137
<i>I won't throw it at you.</i>

15:32.097 --> 15:34.391
<i>You promise?</i>

15:35.434 --> 15:36.936
<i>Thank you.</i>

15:36.936 --> 15:38.771
<i>You're welcome.</i>

15:38.771 --> 15:42.107
<i>I mean, we can both be adults
for the night, right?</i>

15:42.107 --> 15:43.609
<i>Yeah, I think we can.</i>

15:43.609 --> 15:44.944
Has anyone seen Bette and Tina?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.362
<i>Shane, it's showtime.</i>

15:46.362 --> 15:47.780
<i>Let's go.</i>

15:47.780 --> 15:49.615
<i>You clean up nice.</i>

15:51.158 --> 15:53.118
<i>You always clean up nice.</i>

15:53.118 --> 15:55.162
<i>Shane?
- I should go.</i>

15:55.162 --> 15:56.747
<i>I'll see ya out there.</i>

15:56.747 --> 15:58.666
<i>I don't even care</i>

15:58.666 --> 16:01.961
<i>She's got dirty tricks
and she'll play them on me</i>

16:01.961 --> 16:03.379
<i>But I don't even care</i>

16:03.379 --> 16:04.880
<i>I don't even care</i>

16:04.880 --> 16:06.966
<i>I don't care</i>

16:06.966 --> 16:08.884
<i>She knows it</i>

16:08.884 --> 16:12.304
<i>Lava dripping,
burning up the ocean</i>

16:12.304 --> 16:15.641
<i>She knows it, she knows it</i>

16:15.641 --> 16:17.476
<i>Finger on the
golden gun, explosive...</i>

16:17.476 --> 16:18.936
That's my kind of girl.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.938
<i>She knows it...</i>

16:20.938 --> 16:22.398
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

16:22.398 --> 16:24.525
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

16:25.526 --> 16:27.111
<i>Well, you look like
my kind of guy.</i>

16:27.111 --> 16:28.779
<i>She owns it</i>

16:28.779 --> 16:31.782
<i>Lava dripping,
burning up the ocean</i>

16:31.782 --> 16:34.243
<i>She knows it</i>

16:42.793 --> 16:45.421
<i>All right, come on.</i>

16:48.382 --> 16:52.344
<i>Oh. That's not what I want.</i>

16:52.344 --> 16:54.013
<i>What do you want?</i>

16:54.013 --> 16:57.016
<i>I want your coke.</i>

16:57.016 --> 17:00.728
<i>Fuck. [laughs]</i>

17:00.728 --> 17:02.229
<i>It's that obvious?</i>

17:02.229 --> 17:04.440
<i>I mean, I'm a girl who knows
what she wants.</i>

17:04.440 --> 17:06.483
<i>All right, all right. Okay.</i>

17:06.483 --> 17:08.819
<i>Yeah?
- Hell yeah. Let's fucking party.</i>

17:11.613 --> 17:14.199
<i>All right, let's get this...</i>

17:14.199 --> 17:15.743
<i>You ever done this before?</i>

17:15.743 --> 17:16.994
<i>A few times.</i>

17:16.994 --> 17:18.829
<i>Okay.</i>

17:18.829 --> 17:20.622
<i>Did you think that
you were in control?</i>

17:23.709 --> 17:25.002
<i>Let's dance...</i>

17:35.220 --> 17:37.181
<i>God, I'm freezing.</i>

17:37.181 --> 17:39.558
<i>Aren't you?</i>

17:39.558 --> 17:41.810
<i>No. Here, why don't you
take this?</i>

17:41.810 --> 17:43.187
<i>Are you sure?</i>

17:43.187 --> 17:45.314
<i>Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.</i>

17:47.524 --> 17:49.234
<i>There.</i>

17:51.528 --> 17:53.697
<i>What are you doing?</i>

17:53.697 --> 17:55.741
<i>Just trying to make
the most of our time in here.</i>

17:55.741 --> 17:57.326
<i>You want something?</i>

17:57.326 --> 17:59.578
<i>I just... I really hate
your attitude right now.</i>

17:59.578 --> 18:01.497
<i>Well, what would you like me
to be doing instead?</i>

18:01.497 --> 18:03.165
<i>I'd like for you
to get us out of here.</i>

18:03.165 --> 18:04.792
<i>How am I supposed to do that?
I'm not an engineer.</i>

18:04.792 --> 18:06.085
<i>I wouldn't know the first thing</i>

18:06.085 --> 18:06.919
<i>about dismantling
a refrigerator.</i>

18:06.919 --> 18:08.253
<i>I knew it!</i>

18:08.253 --> 18:10.172
<i>Oh, my God.
- Shane, I found them!</i>

18:10.172 --> 18:11.340
<i>They're doing it in the walk-in.</i>

18:11.340 --> 18:12.466
<i>What are you doing?</i>

18:12.466 --> 18:13.759
<i>No, no, no, we're not doing it!</i>

18:13.759 --> 18:15.594
<i>Oh, you're not...?
-</i>

18:15.594 --> 18:17.387
<i>It broke off! We're stuck!
- We're stuck!</i>

18:17.387 --> 18:19.264
<i>Okay, okay, okay, no problem.
- It'll be easy to open it.</i>

18:19.264 --> 18:20.891
<i>I think it's like a twist...
- No, no, it's a pull.</i>

18:20.891 --> 18:21.600
<i>Push, push, yeah.
- It's a pull.</i>

18:22.601 --> 18:24.019
<i>Oh.
- Oh.</i>

18:24.019 --> 18:25.604
<i>Oh, fuck.
- It's fine.</i>

18:25.604 --> 18:26.772
<i>Don't worry.
-</i>

18:26.772 --> 18:28.649
<i>It's okay, it's okay.</i>

18:28.649 --> 18:30.275
<i>It's okay, we'll get you out.
- No. Will you, though?</i>

18:30.275 --> 18:31.527
<i>There are ways to do this.
- Obviously.</i>

18:31.527 --> 18:32.820
<i>Don't panic. What? What?
- Shane.</i>

18:32.820 --> 18:33.904
<i>I got it. Whack it.
- Oh, my God.</i>

18:33.904 --> 18:35.614
No. What the hell

18:35.614 --> 18:36.782
<i>am I supposed to do with this?
I'm not whacking this.</i>

18:36.782 --> 18:38.742
<i>Okay, um...
- No.</i>

18:38.742 --> 18:41.870
<i>You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna call 911.</i>

18:41.870 --> 18:43.413
<i>Again, again.
- Great. Good idea.</i>

18:43.413 --> 18:45.707
<i>Got 'em on speed dial.
- Um, hang tight.</i>

18:45.707 --> 18:47.251
<i>You know,
you should get a punch card.</i>

18:47.251 --> 18:48.627
<i>Okay, it's gonna work out.</i>

18:48.627 --> 18:50.546
<i>See, look, it's gonna work out.</i>

18:50.546 --> 18:52.756
<i>I just hate your positivity.</i>

18:52.756 --> 18:54.424
<i>Don't be so positive right now.</i>

18:54.424 --> 18:56.301
<i>Okay, look, do you want me
to say it's a disaster?</i>

18:56.301 --> 18:58.095
<i>Of course it's a disaster.
We're stuck in a fridge</i>

18:58.095 --> 18:59.972
<i>on our wedding day, but you know
what I'm not gonna do?</i>

18:59.972 --> 19:02.516
<i>I-I'm not... I'm not gonna start
yelling about it.</i>

19:02.516 --> 19:04.101
<i>Well, why not?</i>

19:04.101 --> 19:05.978
<i>That would be a perfectly
reasonable thing to do.</i>

19:05.978 --> 19:09.565
<i>Because I have worked really
hard to quiet those parts of me</i>

19:09.565 --> 19:12.651
<i>so I wouldn't hurt you and I am
afraid that if I let them out,</i>

19:12.651 --> 19:15.487
<i>then I won't be able to
shove them back inside.</i>

19:15.487 --> 19:17.948
<i>I love those parts of you.</i>

19:20.075 --> 19:21.618
<i>You do?</i>

19:21.618 --> 19:22.953
<i>Yes.</i>

19:22.953 --> 19:25.289
<i>I love all the parts.
-</i>

19:25.289 --> 19:26.748
Good news.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.876
<i>Okay, really, really,
really good news.</i>

19:28.876 --> 19:30.752
<i>And just a little bit
of bad news.</i>

19:30.752 --> 19:33.255
<i>Okay, but the good news is that
the fire department's coming</i>

19:33.255 --> 19:35.257
<i>and they're gonna get
you out of here.</i>

19:35.257 --> 19:38.844
<i>Yeah, but the bad news is that
there's a fire in La Cañada,</i>

19:38.844 --> 19:40.387
<i>and they don't know when they
can send someone over here.</i>

19:40.387 --> 19:41.763
<i>Fuck.
- Right. Just like</i>

19:41.763 --> 19:43.432
<i>a little bit of a delay.
- Fuck. This is</i>

19:43.432 --> 19:44.725
<i>fucking ridiculous.
I can't fucking believe this.</i>

19:44.725 --> 19:46.476
<i>All right, look...
- Fucking...</i>

19:46.476 --> 19:49.354
<i>Um, look, I'm not gonna
tell them. They said hours.</i>

19:49.354 --> 19:50.856
<i>Goddamn it.
- Look, we are gonna</i>

19:50.856 --> 19:52.524
<i>get out of here, okay?</i>

19:52.524 --> 19:54.193
<i>We are, all right?</i>

19:54.193 --> 19:55.861
<i>But before we do, we have to
establish a new rule.</i>

19:55.861 --> 19:57.196
<i>Okay.</i>

19:57.196 --> 19:58.947
<i>It's just like we
were doing in therapy.</i>

19:58.947 --> 20:00.365
<i>We have to put
our relationship first.</i>

20:00.365 --> 20:01.867
<i>Yes. Yes.
- Okay?</i>

20:01.867 --> 20:03.368
<i>I will, I promise. I will.
- Yes.</i>

20:03.368 --> 20:06.038
<i>We have to promise
to be our whole selves.</i>

20:06.038 --> 20:07.789
<i>A hundred percent of the time.</i>

20:07.789 --> 20:09.041
<i>Are you sure?</i>

20:09.041 --> 20:10.792
<i>Yes.
- Like a hundred percent?</i>

20:10.792 --> 20:12.127
<i>You have to trust
that the peaceful,</i>

20:12.127 --> 20:13.712
<i>calm parts of you
will still be there.</i>

20:13.712 --> 20:15.631
<i>Alice! Alice!</i>

20:15.631 --> 20:17.841
<i>Call Tasha right now and get us</i>

20:17.841 --> 20:19.218
<i>the fuck out of here because I</i>

20:19.218 --> 20:20.719
<i>am going to marry
the love of my life</i>

20:20.719 --> 20:23.555
<i>today if it is the last
fucking thing that I do!</i>

20:23.555 --> 20:25.515
<i>Go! Go, go, go, go!
- Okay, yes, ma'am.</i>

20:25.515 --> 20:27.059
<i>Will you just say "please"?</i>

20:27.059 --> 20:29.394
<i>Shane, can we use your phone?</i>

20:29.394 --> 20:31.396
<i>optimistic music</i>

20:31.396 --> 20:32.731
<i>Better?</i>

20:32.731 --> 20:34.775
<i>Yes.
- Okay.</i>

20:34.775 --> 20:36.693
<i>Yeah. [chuckles]</i>

20:36.693 --> 20:38.570
<i>That's it.</i>

20:41.573 --> 20:44.409
<i>Yes, Dre, and of course
I want you to come because...</i>

20:45.577 --> 20:47.246
<i>I love you.</i>

20:47.246 --> 20:49.414
<i>If I say it three times, will it
make up for not saying it</i>

20:49.414 --> 20:50.582
<i>when I should've?</i>

20:52.000 --> 20:54.461
<i>I love you.
- Yo, Dani.</i>

20:54.461 --> 20:55.796
<i>I love you.</i>

20:55.796 --> 20:56.630
<i>All right,
that's enough, bro.</i>

20:56.630 --> 20:59.341
<i>Get off the phone.</i>

20:59.341 --> 21:00.676
<i>You are rolling
way too hard for that.</i>

21:00.676 --> 21:02.177
<i>I am not.</i>

21:02.177 --> 21:03.387
<i>I don't even feel
anything right now.</i>

21:03.387 --> 21:04.888
<i>I just love them.</i>

21:04.888 --> 21:07.349
<i>Like, Dre is so nice.</i>

21:07.349 --> 21:09.518
<i>And special and normal.</i>

21:11.770 --> 21:13.105
<i>God, my jaw hurts.</i>

21:13.105 --> 21:14.606
<i>You need candy.
You're rolling.</i>

21:14.606 --> 21:16.775
<i>Here, guys. Uh, they didn't
have any Hi-Chews</i>

21:16.775 --> 21:17.943
<i>but they had these.
- Ooh.</i>

21:17.943 --> 21:19.278
<i>Yes.
- There you go.</i>

21:19.278 --> 21:21.238
<i>Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

21:21.238 --> 21:23.031
<i>Is it...? Hi, hi.</i>

21:23.031 --> 21:24.408
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>

21:24.408 --> 21:26.743
<i>So, we're experiencing
a bit of a delay.</i>

21:26.743 --> 21:29.621
<i>Um, seems the brides are stuck
in a refrigerator.</i>

21:31.123 --> 21:32.833
<i>You know, I look at it like
Bette and Tina</i>

21:32.833 --> 21:35.085
<i>took a long, winding road
to their marriage</i>

21:35.085 --> 21:38.338
<i>so we're gonna take a long,
winding road to their ceremony.</i>

21:38.338 --> 21:40.424
<i>And we'll do the whole
"I do" thing later.</i>

21:40.424 --> 21:42.843
<i>Uh, other than that, enjoy
the open bar. That was me.</i>

21:42.843 --> 21:44.094
<i>Whoo! Yeah!</i>

21:44.094 --> 21:45.137
And that's it, have fun.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.471
<i>Lots of snacks. Yeah. Okay.</i>

21:47.639 --> 21:50.517
<i>I've been busy as a busy bee</i>

21:50.517 --> 21:52.602
<i>Oh, my gosh.</i>

21:52.602 --> 21:54.146
<i>Does she know that this
is like elevator music?</i>

21:54.146 --> 21:55.188
This is my fucking jam.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.189
<i>Oh, she's gone.</i>

21:56.189 --> 21:58.317
<i>Man, I miss that Dani.</i>

21:58.317 --> 21:59.693
<i>Wow.
- She gone-gone.</i>

21:59.693 --> 22:01.278
<i>Look at her,
she looks so pretty.</i>

22:02.779 --> 22:05.282
<i>You go, Dani. Drop it lower.</i>

22:08.535 --> 22:09.828
<i>Aww.</i>

22:09.828 --> 22:11.121
<i>You sure you're not feeling it?</i>

22:11.121 --> 22:12.748
<i>Fly girls do it like this</i>

22:12.748 --> 22:15.000
<i>Money and all the fly
shh you want</i>

22:15.000 --> 22:17.002
<i>Fly girls do it like this</i>

22:17.002 --> 22:19.129
<i>Watch your mouth,
check your tongue...</i>

22:20.839 --> 22:22.799
I don't know, I don't know...

22:22.799 --> 22:25.177
<i>I just, I really love
this song, right?</i>

22:25.177 --> 22:28.513
<i>And it loves you. It loves you.</i>

22:28.513 --> 22:31.683
<i>Nice meeting you, Sophie Suarez.
I'm out.</i>

22:31.683 --> 22:32.976
<i>Nice... Nice...</i>

22:32.976 --> 22:35.354
<i>Nice to meet you, too.</i>

22:35.354 --> 22:36.688
<i>Fuck.</i>

22:36.688 --> 22:38.315
<i>Are you hitting that?</i>

22:38.315 --> 22:40.192
<i>You should. You should.
You should.</i>

22:40.192 --> 22:41.860
<i>That-- that's Pippa Pascal.</i>

22:41.860 --> 22:45.989
<i>She's, like, this super
principled Topanga Canyon,</i>

22:45.989 --> 22:48.200
<i>like, hippie artist.
She dated Bette.</i>

22:48.200 --> 22:49.409
<i>And she--
- Bette? Bette Porter?</i>

22:49.409 --> 22:50.827
Yes, Bette Porter.

22:50.827 --> 22:51.703
<i>And she totally thinks
I'm the devil,</i>

22:51.703 --> 22:53.580
<i>but I love her.</i>

22:53.580 --> 22:55.207
<i>Okay.
- She's, like, so pretty.</i>

22:55.207 --> 22:56.750
<i>She's so pretty.
- Yeah, please go have some fun.</i>

22:56.750 --> 22:58.043
<i>Yeah?
- Yes, go have fun.</i>

22:58.043 --> 22:59.044
<i>I should go?
- Fun is so fun.</i>

22:59.044 --> 23:00.754
<i>You think so?
- Yeah.</i>

23:00.754 --> 23:01.922
<i>Oh, my God, okay, okay, okay.
Hold this, hold this.</i>

23:01.922 --> 23:02.839
<i>Bye-bye!
- Do it, do it, do it!</i>

23:02.839 --> 23:05.550
<i>Yeah.</i>

23:07.928 --> 23:10.055
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.390
<i>W-What's wrong?</i>

23:12.724 --> 23:14.226
<i>I just love Sophie.</i>

23:14.226 --> 23:16.019
<i>Okay.</i>

23:16.019 --> 23:18.522
<i>I never thought that
we'd be friends again.</i>

23:18.522 --> 23:21.149
<i>But we are. We're like...
We're really friends.</i>

23:23.151 --> 23:24.569
<i>You're rolling.
- Okay, yeah, I think</i>

23:24.569 --> 23:26.238
<i>I'm feeling something now.
- Yeah.</i>

23:26.238 --> 23:28.240
<i>Thank you.
- Absolutely. Be right back.</i>

23:28.240 --> 23:29.699
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

23:29.699 --> 23:31.243
<i>Are you leaving?</i>

23:31.243 --> 23:33.078
<i>Like... for good?</i>

23:33.078 --> 23:34.830
<i>I mean, they haven't
even gotten married yet.</i>

23:34.830 --> 23:36.164
<i>You know, I'm happy for them,</i>

23:36.164 --> 23:37.541
<i>but not happy enough
to wait this out.</i>

23:37.541 --> 23:38.583
<i>Fair enough.</i>

23:38.583 --> 23:40.127
<i>I mean, it's very evolved of you</i>

23:40.127 --> 23:41.586
<i>to even show up at an ex's
wedding. I get it.</i>

23:41.586 --> 23:44.089
<i>Oh, so you've been sniffing
around about me?</i>

23:44.089 --> 23:45.424
<i>Just a little bit.</i>

23:45.424 --> 23:47.092
<i>Mm-hmm, a little bit.</i>

23:47.092 --> 23:48.468
Okay...

23:48.468 --> 23:50.262
<i>But don't give me
too much credit.</i>

23:50.262 --> 23:53.265
<i>I'm not exactly upset that
they're locked in a fridge.</i>

23:53.265 --> 23:55.559
<i>You feel?
- Wow, okay.</i>

23:55.559 --> 23:57.602
<i>This level of petty?
I really aspire to it.</i>

23:57.602 --> 23:59.771
It's good, it's good.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.065
<i>That'd be me. Well, as long as
it doesn't hurt anybody, right?</i>

24:02.065 --> 24:03.400
<i>Right.</i>

24:06.945 --> 24:09.364
<i>Well... before you go,</i>

24:09.364 --> 24:12.534
<i>do you want to have
some harmless fun?</i>

24:12.534 --> 24:14.286
<i>You know, real fast?
A little Tokyo Drift?</i>

24:20.459 --> 24:21.585
<i>Congratulations.</i>

24:21.585 --> 24:22.794
<i>Thank you!
- Bye!</i>

24:22.794 --> 24:24.212
<i>I'm-a take that as a yes</i>

24:25.505 --> 24:27.549
<i>I'll take that as a yes</i>

24:27.549 --> 24:29.426
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

24:29.426 --> 24:30.635
<i>Guys?</i>

24:30.635 --> 24:31.887
<i>Over there.</i>

24:31.887 --> 24:33.305
<i>Hey, guys? Hi!
- Hi!</i>

24:33.305 --> 24:34.973
<i>Angie. Oh, my God!
It's so good to see you.</i>

24:34.973 --> 24:36.057
<i>It's good to see you, too.</i>

24:36.057 --> 24:37.476
<i>Are you okay?</i>

24:37.476 --> 24:38.768
<i>Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

24:38.768 --> 24:40.312
<i>Hi. Congratulations
on your big day.</i>

24:40.312 --> 24:41.563
<i>What the fuck is he doing here?</i>

24:41.563 --> 24:43.398
<i>Thanks for asking.</i>

24:43.398 --> 24:46.610
<i>Yeah, I was thinking about our
conversation we had earlier.</i>

24:46.610 --> 24:48.320
<i>Uh-huh.
- And I decided that</i>

24:48.320 --> 24:49.488
<i>all you need to do is just
to get to know him better.</i>

24:49.488 --> 24:50.989
<i>No. No.</i>

24:50.989 --> 24:52.824
<i>I don't need to get
to know him better, okay?</i>

24:52.824 --> 24:54.993
<i>So, unless he's willing to
acknowledge the power dynamics,</i>

24:54.993 --> 24:58.163
<i>then there's really nothing
to discuss, for fuck's sake.</i>

24:58.163 --> 25:00.123
<i>I'm just gonna go.
- No, no, no, no, please.</i>

25:00.123 --> 25:01.333
<i>Yeah.
- No.</i>

25:01.333 --> 25:02.626
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

25:02.626 --> 25:04.127
<i>Angie, this-this was a mistake.
- Hendrix,</i>

25:04.127 --> 25:05.837
<i>it's not a mistake.
- Hey, I would've loved</i>

25:05.837 --> 25:07.422
<i>to spend more time with you
before I go,</i>

25:07.422 --> 25:09.799
<i>but I don't think--
- Go? Go where?</i>

25:10.717 --> 25:12.511
<i>New York.</i>

25:12.511 --> 25:14.137
<i>I'm moving there.</i>

25:15.096 --> 25:17.349
<i>I'm sorry, what?
- Um, my book</i>

25:17.349 --> 25:19.601
<i>got a bite from a pretty major
publishing house.</i>

25:19.601 --> 25:21.186
<i>Oh, my God.
- And I-I was trying to find</i>

25:21.186 --> 25:23.522
<i>the right time to tell you,
and I don't think...</i>

25:23.522 --> 25:24.856
<i>I thought we had something real.</i>

25:24.856 --> 25:26.149
<i>What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

25:26.149 --> 25:27.692
<i>Hey, hey, this--
- Don't do that.</i>

25:27.692 --> 25:30.445
<i>Don't try to act like you
actually give a shit.</i>

25:30.445 --> 25:33.698
<i>Okay, this is something real,
but I need</i>

25:33.698 --> 25:35.367
<i>to focus on myself.</i>

25:35.367 --> 25:36.701
<i>And my career.</i>

25:36.701 --> 25:38.870
And obviously I don't want

25:38.870 --> 25:40.455
<i>it to be this way, but--</i>

25:40.455 --> 25:42.541
<i>No, have fun in New York
writing your fucking book.</i>

25:42.541 --> 25:44.000
<i>I hope it gets better reviews
than the first one.</i>

25:44.000 --> 25:45.335
<i>Because yikes.
- Okay,</i>

25:45.335 --> 25:46.169
<i>you don't have
to be mean about it.</i>

25:46.169 --> 25:47.170
<i>You know what?</i>

25:47.170 --> 25:49.839
<i>Go fuck yourself, Hendrix!</i>

25:49.839 --> 25:52.259
<i>somber music</i>

26:03.812 --> 26:05.647
<i>I just...</i>

26:05.647 --> 26:08.942
<i>Just... Just don't say
I told you so.</i>

26:11.695 --> 26:15.657
<i>Yeah, it says it's idiot-proof,
but... I can't do it.</i>

26:15.657 --> 26:17.951
<i>I hear that, but you need
to relax, babe.</i>

26:17.951 --> 26:20.579
<i>The clock is literally ticking
on this sperm.</i>

26:20.579 --> 26:22.706
<i>No, I just,
I-I feel like I'm dying</i>

26:22.706 --> 26:24.332
<i>or something right now,
I-I can't breathe.</i>

26:24.332 --> 26:26.835
<i>You're not gonna die.</i>

26:26.835 --> 26:29.087
<i>Look, we're about to have
this cute little baby.</i>

26:29.087 --> 26:30.589
<i>You can die after.</i>

26:30.589 --> 26:32.173
<i>What if we do die after?</i>

26:32.173 --> 26:33.842
<i>You know, the kid will be
so messed up, I just...</i>

26:33.842 --> 26:35.176
<i>We're not gonna die.</i>

26:35.176 --> 26:36.595
<i>You can't know that for sure.</i>

26:36.595 --> 26:38.013
<i>Okay, well, we'll write a will.</i>

26:39.222 --> 26:41.224
<i>pensive music</i>

26:45.770 --> 26:47.522
<i>What if you die?
- Well, if I die,</i>

26:47.522 --> 26:48.773
<i>I'm gonna take you with me.</i>

26:48.773 --> 26:51.776
<i>No. During childbirth.
Or after.</i>

26:51.776 --> 26:54.112
<i>I don't know enough about
your disability yet.</i>

26:54.112 --> 26:57.115
<i>Are you fucking kidding me
right now? Seriously?</i>

26:57.115 --> 27:00.076
<i>This is the conversation
we're having?</i>

27:00.076 --> 27:01.703
<i>The heart is a muscle.</i>

27:01.703 --> 27:04.289
<i>I mean, sure, there could
be complications, Micah.</i>

27:04.289 --> 27:06.625
<i>But all of the doctors told--
- Labor is intense.</i>

27:06.625 --> 27:08.168
<i>I can fucking handle it.</i>

27:08.168 --> 27:09.711
<i>I want to talk about what
happens if you can't.</i>

27:09.711 --> 27:10.712
<i>I don't want to talk about it.</i>

27:10.712 --> 27:11.838
<i>Lost my way</i>

27:11.838 --> 27:13.882
<i>To try to find you</i>

27:13.882 --> 27:16.635
<i>Walked on ice
and then I fell through</i>

27:16.635 --> 27:18.219
<i>Fallin' so fast...</i>

27:18.219 --> 27:20.722
<i>Oh, my God.
This is exactly what I need.</i>

27:20.722 --> 27:22.557
<i>Oh, shit. [laughing]</i>

27:24.726 --> 27:25.852
Dude, give me another.

27:25.852 --> 27:26.853
<i>Rough day?</i>

27:26.853 --> 27:27.896
<i>My ex is here.</i>

27:27.896 --> 27:29.230
So, yeah.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.234
They are missing out.

27:33.234 --> 27:34.319
<i>Yeah, no shit.</i>

27:36.821 --> 27:39.407
<i>I wish I could see</i>

27:39.407 --> 27:40.659
All right.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.412
<i>Through your eyes</i>

27:44.412 --> 27:45.413
Can I brag?

27:45.413 --> 27:47.123
<i>Oh, you better.</i>

27:47.123 --> 27:51.586
<i>The Hammer has offered me
my first career retrospective.</i>

27:51.586 --> 27:53.004
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

27:53.004 --> 27:54.506
<i>You're incredible.</i>

27:54.506 --> 27:55.674
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

27:55.674 --> 27:57.300
<i>Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.</i>

27:57.300 --> 27:58.802
<i>And what about you?
I mean, how did you--</i>

27:58.802 --> 28:00.428
How did you start working

28:00.428 --> 28:02.180
<i>for Alice?
Like, what was your path?</i>

28:02.180 --> 28:07.227
<i>Well, I made two social
justice-y docs...</i>

28:07.227 --> 28:08.478
<i>Oh, that's what's up.</i>

28:08.478 --> 28:10.063
<i>...coming out of grad school.</i>

28:10.063 --> 28:12.273
<i>And then the second one
made its way to Sundance.</i>

28:12.273 --> 28:13.274
<i>Okay.</i>

28:13.274 --> 28:14.609
<i>Sundance.
- Yeah.</i>

28:14.609 --> 28:16.194
<i>Sundance, we were there.</i>

28:16.194 --> 28:18.196
<i>And Alice saw it,</i>

28:18.196 --> 28:19.989
<i>and she was really impressed,</i>

28:19.989 --> 28:22.200
<i>so she called me and I just
couldn't believe it was her</i>

28:22.200 --> 28:24.661
<i>and she said,
"Hey, it's Alice Pieszecki,"</i>

28:24.661 --> 28:26.371
<i>I died and...</i>

28:26.371 --> 28:28.289
<i>Right.
- I've been working for her</i>

28:28.289 --> 28:29.290
<i>ever since.</i>

28:29.290 --> 28:31.584
<i>Wow. Wow. What a ride.</i>

28:31.584 --> 28:32.711
<i>Yeah.
- What a ride.</i>

28:32.711 --> 28:34.504
<i>So, what's next?</i>

28:34.504 --> 28:35.505
<i>Well, actually...</i>

28:35.505 --> 28:38.550
<i>uh, she just promoted me.</i>

28:38.550 --> 28:40.009
<i>Nice.
- Yeah.</i>

28:40.009 --> 28:42.387
<i>I meant though,
what are you making next?</i>

28:42.387 --> 28:43.972
<i>Like what's your next doc about?</i>

28:43.972 --> 28:47.726
<i>Oh, um... [laughs]</i>

28:47.726 --> 28:49.894
<i>Eh? [laughs]</i>

28:49.894 --> 28:53.523
<i>Um, I...</i>

28:53.523 --> 28:56.317
<i>I guess I'm still trying
to figure that out.</i>

28:56.317 --> 28:59.738
<i>Well, I applied
to this grant, but...</i>

28:59.738 --> 29:02.115
<i>with the promotion, I just...</i>

29:02.115 --> 29:03.324
<i>I don't think
it's the right time.</i>

29:03.324 --> 29:05.118
<i>Mmm.</i>

29:05.118 --> 29:07.078
<i>Is it ever the right time?</i>

29:08.955 --> 29:11.458
<i>Just got to make a move, right?</i>

29:11.458 --> 29:13.418
<i>Yeah.
- It's a winding road.</i>

29:13.418 --> 29:16.463
<i>But you're on it.</i>

29:16.463 --> 29:18.465
<i>gentle music</i>

29:27.640 --> 29:28.725
<i>Really, cow?</i>

29:28.725 --> 29:30.518
Oh, my God.

29:30.518 --> 29:32.520
<i>Damn you, cow.</i>

29:32.520 --> 29:36.191
<i>I guess we, uh,
should be making our way back.</i>

29:36.191 --> 29:38.359
<i>Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah.</i>

29:38.359 --> 29:40.653
<i>Good evening, ladies and sir.</i>

29:40.653 --> 29:41.988
<i>Bye, cows.</i>

29:42.989 --> 29:45.116
<i>So, uh, are you staying?</i>

29:45.116 --> 29:48.077
<i>Um...</i>

29:48.077 --> 29:50.121
<i>Can't leave now, can I?</i>

29:53.291 --> 29:54.959
<i>upbeat music</i>

29:54.959 --> 29:58.129
<i>I think I just
won the lottery...</i>

29:58.129 --> 29:59.964
<i>You're so pretty.</i>

29:59.964 --> 30:02.926
<i>Fuck, it's about time
you noticed.</i>

30:02.926 --> 30:04.636
<i>I've just been, like,
standing next to you all day.</i>

30:04.636 --> 30:06.888
<i>I always think you're pretty.</i>

30:10.350 --> 30:12.811
<i>Oh, shit. My friend's here.
- Who?</i>

30:12.811 --> 30:15.730
<i>G! What up, dude?</i>

30:15.730 --> 30:17.106
<i>Rox, what's good?</i>

30:17.106 --> 30:18.983
<i>It's so good to see you.</i>

30:18.983 --> 30:20.443
<i>G-Flip, hi. How do
you two know each other?</i>

30:20.443 --> 30:23.112
<i>Vegas.
- Vegas.</i>

30:23.112 --> 30:25.657
<i>They were out of tonic
so I just went straight gin.</i>

30:25.657 --> 30:26.658
<i>Thank you, darling.</i>

30:26.658 --> 30:28.326
Shut. Up.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.829
<i>I'm sorry, I love your show.</i>

30:30.829 --> 30:35.291
<i>And you are like so much
prettier in person. Wow.</i>

30:35.291 --> 30:36.376
<i>She's the hottest.</i>

30:36.376 --> 30:38.169
<i>That's really sweet. Thank you.</i>

30:38.169 --> 30:40.880
<i>I actually dated a lesbian
realtor named Gigi Ghorbani.</i>

30:40.880 --> 30:42.715
<i>Do you know her?
- Oh, my God, yes.</i>

30:42.715 --> 30:44.843
<i>I love her. I actually
want her for next season.</i>

30:44.843 --> 30:47.136
<i>Baby, what's her fiancée's
name again?</i>

30:47.136 --> 30:48.388
<i>I think it's Nat.
- Nat!</i>

30:48.388 --> 30:51.432
<i>Yeah, remember she likes
public sex?</i>

30:51.432 --> 30:53.017
<i>I love them.</i>

30:53.017 --> 30:54.561
<i>I feel like they'd
be so perfect for the show.</i>

30:54.561 --> 30:56.020
<i>Don't you guys think?
- Did you say...</i>

30:56.020 --> 30:57.814
<i>Did you say fiancée? Fiancée?</i>

31:04.404 --> 31:06.072
<i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

31:07.240 --> 31:08.616
<i>We can go if you want.</i>

31:08.616 --> 31:09.826
<i>Aha.</i>

31:09.826 --> 31:11.619
<i>I knew I had gum.</i>

31:11.619 --> 31:14.330
<i>Yo, focus.</i>

31:14.330 --> 31:16.165
<i>Are you okay?</i>

31:16.165 --> 31:17.709
<i>Do...</i>

31:27.427 --> 31:29.262
<i>Gigi loves gum.</i>

31:34.475 --> 31:36.728
<i>I think I did it.</i>

31:36.728 --> 31:39.022
<i>What did you do?</i>

31:39.022 --> 31:41.399
<i>I think I'm finally over her.</i>

31:42.483 --> 31:44.402
<i>Ha!</i>

31:45.445 --> 31:46.988
<i>Hell yeah, you are.</i>

31:51.117 --> 31:53.578
I wish this was real.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.038
<i>This is real.</i>

31:55.038 --> 31:57.123
<i>No.</i>

31:57.123 --> 31:59.834
<i>You're gonna go
back to Costa Rica</i>

31:59.834 --> 32:02.170
<i>and you're gonna forget
about me.</i>

32:02.170 --> 32:03.504
<i>I'm not.</i>

32:03.504 --> 32:05.673
<i>Mm?</i>

32:05.673 --> 32:07.342
<i>I got a condo in Echo Park.</i>

32:07.342 --> 32:10.678
<i>No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.</i>

32:10.678 --> 32:14.098
<i>I told you to call me
when your heart healed</i>

32:14.098 --> 32:17.101
<i>and you called, so... I'm here.</i>

32:18.436 --> 32:20.396
<i>Why didn't you tell me
this earlier?</i>

32:20.396 --> 32:23.524
<i>Oh, 'cause you were talking
about Dre all day, I got...</i>

<i>But we have to talk about this
before we have a baby.</i>

33:36.014 --> 33:39.642
<i>I'm just so fucking confused why
you bring this up right now.</i>

33:39.642 --> 33:41.185
<i>Because I didn't want to say
the wrong thing.</i>

33:41.185 --> 33:43.146

- What if you die</i>

<i>What the fuck?
What are you doing?</i>

<i>I am calling it off.
We're obviously not ready.</i>

33:53.865 --> 33:55.533
<i>You can't just fucking
do that though.</i>

<i>You can't just make every life
decision without me.</i>

<i>I mean, you are the worst!
- Okay, you know what?</i>

<i>You've really lost it.
- It's obvious now</i>

35:31.796 --> 35:34.257
<i>because you just... You could
never handle my success.</i>

35:34.257 --> 35:36.134
<i>No. No.
- And it is written all over you.</i>

35:36.134 --> 35:38.469
<i>It seeps out of your pores.
- Not true. I did not want to be</i>

<i>Gotta know</i>

51:44.976 --> 51:47.145
<i>'Cause when
the sun goes down</i>

51:47.145 --> 51:49.439
<i>And I'm looking behind</i>

51:49.439 --> 51:51.441
<i>What I need</i>

51:51.441 --> 51:53.568
<i>You're what I need</i>

51:53.568 --> 51:56.446
<i>When the stars get high</i>

51:56.446 --> 51:58.448
<i>And I'm looking behind</i>

51:58.448 --> 52:00.534
<i>You're what I need</i>

52:00.534 --> 52:02.786
<i>You're what
I need</i>

52:02.786 --> 52:05.247
<i>Yeah, you give me that spark</i>

52:05.247 --> 52:08.083
<i>Give me that fire,
give me that glow</i>

52:08.083 --> 52:10.585
<i>And you're taking me places</i>

52:10.585 --> 52:12.295
<i>That nobody goes</i>
