00:05.664 --> 00:07.914
- Do the new uniforms feel weird to you?
- _

00:07.914 --> 00:09.013
I am so itchy.

00:09.050 --> 00:11.800
My body is actively rejecting this uniform.

00:11.800 --> 00:14.747
This job ruins everything.
My skin. My dating life.

00:15.302 --> 00:17.335
Would you like to vent
about your dating life?

00:17.371 --> 00:18.804
Yes. You remember Bryan,

00:18.839 --> 00:20.205
the cute chef that I met?

00:20.240 --> 00:21.473
Well, we still haven't found time

00:21.508 --> 00:22.674
to have our first date.

00:22.709 --> 00:23.975
I was supposed to see him last night,

00:24.011 --> 00:25.010
but then we got delayed in Reno.

00:25.045 --> 00:26.978
Oh, honey. If your plans hinge on Reno,

00:27.014 --> 00:28.213
there's something wrong with your plans.

00:28.248 --> 00:29.681
No, the problem is when you spend

00:29.750 --> 00:31.817
60 hours a week in the
sky, it is impossible

00:31.852 --> 00:34.207
to have a normal relationship
with a regular person.

00:34.207 --> 00:36.963
Can't have relationships
with airline people, either.

00:36.988 --> 00:39.188
- Hot dammit.
- What happened to you?

00:39.223 --> 00:40.832
Love happened to me.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.737
It happened to me hard,

00:42.737 --> 00:44.049
and not in the good way.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.809
Gwen left me for another man.

00:45.809 --> 00:47.876
Oh, no. Who's Gwen?

00:47.911 --> 00:49.811
She was the air traffic
controller I fell for.

00:49.846 --> 00:51.746
She left me for a limo driver named Rod.

00:52.088 --> 00:53.769
He probably used a line on her like,

00:54.277 --> 00:57.078
"My car's not the only
thing longer than average."

00:57.988 --> 01:00.035
- God, that's a good line.
- I get it, Dave.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.122
Love is the worst.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.390
The absolute worst.

01:02.425 --> 01:03.558
It's like, "Why even try?"

01:03.763 --> 01:05.693
The universe is a cold bastard.

01:06.388 --> 01:07.629
Sounds hard.

01:07.664 --> 01:09.664
I deal with systemic racism every day.

01:09.995 --> 01:11.266
Least you're getting laid.

01:11.301 --> 01:12.430
Damn right, I am.

01:14.004 --> 01:15.236

01:32.491 --> 01:35.152
Is it me, or is the gate
more crowded than usual?

01:35.425 --> 01:38.326
Well, there's a big MMA fight tonight.

01:38.361 --> 01:40.228
- Ah.
- McKnickerson-Kang II.

01:40.297 --> 01:41.462
It's a rematch. The Irish Volcano

01:41.498 --> 01:42.831
versus the Emerald of Samoa.

01:42.866 --> 01:44.933
This is huge betting weekend for me.

01:44.968 --> 01:46.434
Well, it is a lot of men.

01:46.469 --> 01:48.036
It must be a good weekend for you, too.

01:48.071 --> 01:49.771
No, fight nights are
usually dead at the club,

01:49.796 --> 01:51.770
so we have our intramural softball game.

01:51.770 --> 01:53.908
It's a makeup against Momshells.
They canceled last week

01:53.944 --> 01:55.700
- due to custody hearings.
- Yeah.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.733
Hope they're ready to
lose two weeks in a row.

01:57.770 --> 01:58.793
Dear God.

01:58.969 --> 02:00.134
I'm in charge of snacks.

02:05.243 --> 02:07.254
Stop... fighting... back.

02:07.278 --> 02:08.344
Uh, excuse me, miss?

02:08.380 --> 02:09.645
I'm a little busy here.

02:09.817 --> 02:11.715
I just need to know where to put this.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.560
Oh, come on, dude. Bryan.

02:13.847 --> 02:14.918
Hi.

02:14.953 --> 02:15.919
What are you doing here?

02:15.954 --> 02:17.554
Well, I thought since we can't

02:17.589 --> 02:18.889
schedule a date in the world,

02:18.924 --> 02:20.190
I'd bring a date here.

02:20.259 --> 02:21.324
Oh, you brought a date?

02:21.360 --> 02:22.559
That seems cruel, but fine.

02:22.594 --> 02:23.694
She's getting a middle seat.

02:24.070 --> 02:25.139
Bad phrasing.

02:25.164 --> 02:27.028
I meant we could have a date at your work.

02:27.053 --> 02:29.299
I bought tickets to fly
back and forth all weekend,

02:29.334 --> 02:30.734
which you'll either find charming

02:30.769 --> 02:32.991
or use as grounds for a restraining order.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.941
Well, lucky for you, I
can't afford a lawyer,

02:35.976 --> 02:37.534
so I have to find it charming.

02:37.716 --> 02:39.049
But really...

02:39.084 --> 02:40.217
I don't know what to say.

02:40.252 --> 02:41.585
I mean, this is, like, the sweetest thing

02:41.620 --> 02:43.253
- anyone's ever done for me.
- Miss?

02:43.289 --> 02:45.389
Can I borrow your shoes
to go to the bathroom?

02:45.861 --> 02:48.796
I have to go explain society to someone,

02:48.831 --> 02:50.297
but I will be back.

02:50.333 --> 02:52.499
Well, uh, you know, take your time.

02:52.535 --> 02:54.885
I'll have a-a whole date waiting
for you when you're ready.

03:01.299 --> 03:03.397
You're gonna have to handle
the comms today, Alan.

03:03.397 --> 03:05.497
I don't think I can bear
to hear Gwen's voice.

03:05.566 --> 03:07.066
Oh, Gwen's not working this week.

03:07.101 --> 03:08.727
She told me she was going on vacation

03:08.752 --> 03:10.040
with some guy named Rod.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.705
Said he's taking her to Poundtown?

03:15.910 --> 03:17.342
If she says it's nice,

03:17.378 --> 03:19.101
I might take myself to Poundtown.

03:24.449 --> 03:26.719
Oh! Excuse me...

03:27.379 --> 03:30.347
That is unexpected reveal.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.343
You bought him his own seat?

03:33.708 --> 03:35.659
Yeah. He gets real whiny

03:35.659 --> 03:37.496
when I try putting him under the plane.

03:38.081 --> 03:39.447
Yeah, still better

03:39.482 --> 03:41.579
than sitting next to chatty Canadian.

03:45.444 --> 03:47.121
Oh, uh, excuse me.

03:47.157 --> 03:48.589
I think you might have taken my seat.

03:48.625 --> 03:50.354
Nope. Don't think so.

03:50.679 --> 03:52.553
Okay, well, th-that is my seat,

03:52.578 --> 03:54.812
because that's my NPR tote
bag, and that's my-my book.

03:54.847 --> 03:57.381
- Oh, this book?
- Yes. It's-it's actually

03:57.450 --> 03:59.312
a gripping tome on some
of the nicer points...

03:59.343 --> 04:00.582
Oh, my God!

04:00.953 --> 04:02.486
Wow. Well, now you have a problem with me

04:02.522 --> 04:04.514
and with the Pasadena Public Library.

04:04.824 --> 04:06.623
But no matter. I will find another seat.

04:10.630 --> 04:11.798
Hmm.

04:12.575 --> 04:14.932
So sorry to keep you
waiting. I'm all yours now.

04:14.957 --> 04:16.866
Well, I hope you brought your passport,

04:16.903 --> 04:20.204
because our date begins
by you getting whisked away

04:20.591 --> 04:22.892
to Argentina circa 2012.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.996
Now, you can't bring in
a whole bottle of Malbec,

04:26.064 --> 04:28.197
but you can smuggle it
in three ounces at a time.

04:28.615 --> 04:29.969
Ronnie, we have a problem.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.734
Oh, I'm in Argentina right now, Colin.

04:31.769 --> 04:33.769
Oh, look, it's the restaurant guy

04:33.805 --> 04:35.037
from the restaurant.

04:35.073 --> 04:36.205
What's all this, then?

04:36.274 --> 04:38.374
Just a little makeshift plane date.

04:38.409 --> 04:40.009
'Cause who doesn't love a shampoo-y finish

04:40.044 --> 04:41.177
under a buttery Chard?

04:41.212 --> 04:42.609
Is there a problem, Colin?

04:42.671 --> 04:43.832
Yes, I'm sorry.

04:43.863 --> 04:45.730
Um, that guy over there took my seat.

04:45.731 --> 04:47.183
Okay, well, just find another one.

04:47.218 --> 04:48.484
Well, that's the problem.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.601
There aren't any.

04:49.601 --> 04:50.667
Oh, God.

04:50.969 --> 04:52.468
Don't tell me we're...

04:52.504 --> 04:54.637
- Overbooked?
- By four people.

04:54.672 --> 04:56.506
I talked to the gate
agents, who blamed ticketing.

04:56.541 --> 04:58.074
Then I talked to ticketing,
who blamed the Web site.

04:58.109 --> 05:00.076
Then I talked to the Web
guys, who hacked my Twitter.

05:00.111 --> 05:01.611
I blame the gate agents.

05:01.646 --> 05:03.079
They love calling names
off the standby list

05:03.114 --> 05:04.493
and watching the world burn.

05:04.494 --> 05:05.848
It's ironic, isn't it?

05:05.884 --> 05:07.717
The plane is overbooked,

05:07.752 --> 05:09.847
yet the seat in my heart remains vacant.

05:09.848 --> 05:11.128
Don't tell the gate agents

05:11.128 --> 05:12.789
because they'll stuff two people in there.

05:17.729 --> 05:19.929
Well, I guess we have
to deal with this now.

05:24.059 --> 05:25.735
All right, everyone.

05:25.770 --> 05:27.603
Like a '90s rap video,

05:27.639 --> 05:29.272
this plane's got too many butts.

05:29.307 --> 05:31.374
So four lucky people

05:31.409 --> 05:33.109
willing to take a later flight

05:33.144 --> 05:36.245
will receive $100.

05:36.281 --> 05:37.780
Ooh!

05:38.817 --> 05:41.484
Okay, two hundred...

05:42.164 --> 05:43.696
and fifty...

05:44.832 --> 05:46.823
five dollars.

05:47.736 --> 05:48.958
Come on, guys.

05:49.027 --> 05:52.295
The average round-trip ticket
on Jackpot costs, like, $12.

05:52.363 --> 05:54.156
With that money, you
could buy yourself, like...

05:55.083 --> 05:56.466
How many flights will that buy?

05:56.501 --> 05:58.801
If I could do that math, do
you think I'd have this job?

05:58.837 --> 06:00.910
We're holding out for big money.

06:00.910 --> 06:02.738
Big money? This is Jackpot.

06:02.774 --> 06:04.707
They buy refurbished
seats from plane crashes.

06:04.742 --> 06:06.442
This is all we're authorized to give.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.347
Please, someone take this deal,

06:09.347 --> 06:11.569
because it only gets worse from here.

06:12.851 --> 06:15.752
All right. I'm sorry,
everyone, but Jackpot protocol

06:15.787 --> 06:17.387
says until four of you take the offer,

06:17.422 --> 06:19.522
there's no food, no drinks

06:19.762 --> 06:20.856
and no bathrooms.

06:22.761 --> 06:24.727
Now you understand why I oohed

06:24.763 --> 06:25.952
when she offered the money.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.360
- Hey, I'll give you five bucks for the...
- Ew, no.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.695
No, for the water.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.483
I'm dying here, and they
won't give us anything.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.434
- I'll sell it to you for $20.
- Deal.

06:45.312 --> 06:47.912
Just wondering, what
made you say, "Ew, no,"

06:47.948 --> 06:49.547
and, uh, how much for that?

06:53.131 --> 06:54.251
Uh-uh.

06:58.532 --> 07:00.251
Okay, I'm ready for more date.

07:00.251 --> 07:01.667
Don't you have to focus on getting

07:01.702 --> 07:02.935
four people off this plane?

07:02.970 --> 07:04.636
Nah, someone's gonna crack.

07:04.672 --> 07:06.638
In the meantime, we've had shampoo.

07:06.674 --> 07:08.069
- What's for conditioner?
- Well,

07:08.069 --> 07:09.301
I'm glad you asked.

07:10.819 --> 07:13.039
Is that supposed to be sushi?

07:13.075 --> 07:15.442
May I present to you
freshly caught Swedish Fish

07:15.477 --> 07:16.843
on Rice Krispy Treats.

07:16.878 --> 07:18.445
I call it the Hudson News Roll.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.746
I know how much you like crap.

07:19.781 --> 07:21.347
I love crap.

07:21.383 --> 07:23.493
Ronnie, report to the cockpit.

07:23.752 --> 07:26.019
Aw, crap. I'll be right back.

07:31.893 --> 07:34.928
Hey, Dave, we are totally on
top of this overbooked thing.

07:34.963 --> 07:36.930
I'm sure people are
gonna start dropping soon.

07:36.965 --> 07:39.032
I'm actually not sure why they haven't yet.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.366
Cheez-Its are $10. Waters are $20.

07:40.402 --> 07:41.935
I do not make change.

07:41.970 --> 07:43.603
I don't care about that.
I called you in to talk

07:43.638 --> 07:45.105
about how love is the worst

07:45.140 --> 07:47.413
and to rip up photos of our exes.

07:47.413 --> 07:50.180
I don't actually have any photos
of Gwen, so I had to improvise.

07:50.216 --> 07:52.016
I'm sorry, Dave.

07:52.051 --> 07:54.985
But I'm actually feeling pretty
hopeful about love right now.

07:55.021 --> 07:56.475
You're abandoning me, too?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.992
Traitor. This is you now.

08:06.877 --> 08:07.913
Sorry, Alan.

08:07.938 --> 08:09.508
I know how hard you worked on that.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.487
Listen to me, Caroline, this
is the gate agents' fault.

08:13.662 --> 08:15.261
You're the gate agent.

08:15.297 --> 08:16.818
It's your fault, Caroline.

08:17.508 --> 08:19.051
Then come in here and talk to me.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.271
Well, I'm not coming out there.

08:21.803 --> 08:22.902
Fine.

08:22.938 --> 08:24.254
We'll meet in Switzerland.

08:25.107 --> 08:27.640
I don't know what's taking
you sky waiters so long,

08:27.676 --> 08:29.209
but we need this gate.

08:29.244 --> 08:32.044
Believe it or not, other
flights need to take off, too.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.325
The world doesn't revolve
around you and your little plane.

08:34.325 --> 08:36.649
We would've been long gone if
you hadn't kept tossing bodies

08:36.684 --> 08:38.551
in here like it was a Malaysian rickshaw.

08:38.587 --> 08:40.553
Well, when corporate calls to ask

08:40.589 --> 08:42.756
why their entire schedule's delayed,

08:42.791 --> 08:45.725
I'll be telling them it's
because <i> you</i> couldn't handle

08:45.761 --> 08:46.995
your business, Bernard.

08:46.996 --> 08:49.685
You keep my name out of
your ramen-breath mouth.

08:49.685 --> 08:51.351
It's not ramen.

08:51.420 --> 08:52.884
It's pho.

08:54.656 --> 08:56.156
Ronnie, two things.

08:56.191 --> 08:58.759
Caroline has a surprisingly
international palate.

08:58.794 --> 09:01.375
she's gonna pin this all
on us if we don't take off soon.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.130
Why won't any of these people leave?

09:03.165 --> 09:05.599
I don't know. I mean, who
cares this much about a fight?

09:05.667 --> 09:08.101
If you offered me 250
bucks to get off this plane,

09:08.137 --> 09:09.803
I'd be knee-deep in Red Lobster

09:09.838 --> 09:12.072
- Cheddar Bay Biscuits by now.
- We need to do something.

09:12.107 --> 09:14.307
We already have Jackpot's second
worst on-time departure rating.

09:14.343 --> 09:15.919
Any worse and we lose to Tampa.

09:15.950 --> 09:16.977
Tampa, Ronnie!

09:17.012 --> 09:18.011
Well, what are we supposed to do?

09:18.046 --> 09:19.643
We already took away everything.

09:20.682 --> 09:22.015
Not everything.

09:29.257 --> 09:31.276
Let's see how long they last without AC.

09:35.212 --> 09:37.748
Sir, since we're overbooked,

09:37.914 --> 09:41.844
would you mind stowing your
wooden boy to free up a seat?

09:42.258 --> 09:44.501
Hey, I paid for this
seat. I'm sittin' in it.

09:44.706 --> 09:46.673
Hey, can we talk like humans?

09:46.708 --> 09:49.543
I mean, he should move.
He's not even real man.

09:49.578 --> 09:51.665
Neither are you, and you're not getting up.

09:51.947 --> 09:53.580
That is so immature.

09:53.615 --> 09:55.982
You're using dummy to be mean to me?

09:56.018 --> 09:59.553
"Dummy"? This <i> dummy's</i> got
three sold-out shows at the Rio

09:59.588 --> 10:01.897
this weekend, you trash-humper.

10:02.631 --> 10:05.091
Hey, what did you just call me?

10:05.127 --> 10:06.059
Nothing.

10:06.094 --> 10:07.360
Trash-humper.

10:07.396 --> 10:08.695
That's slander!

10:08.730 --> 10:10.697
I don't do that with trash!

10:10.732 --> 10:13.765
Oh, no? Then what are you
doing with that can of Pringles?

10:13.873 --> 10:16.036
Oh, I'm using this as my wallet.

10:20.108 --> 10:22.409
I don't know what you're up
to, but your vibe is all wrong.

10:22.444 --> 10:23.977
I'm trying to get four
people off this plane.

10:24.012 --> 10:25.712
Are you with us or against us?

10:25.747 --> 10:27.080
I don't know what you mean, Bernard.

10:27.239 --> 10:28.963
I'm just a clueless stripper.

10:29.430 --> 10:30.429
Uh-huh.

10:30.468 --> 10:32.186
One eyebrow is already raised.

10:32.221 --> 10:33.809
Don't make me raise the other.

10:37.659 --> 10:40.193
- Do you mind, bro?
- Oh! Excuse me.

10:40.229 --> 10:42.262
Um, I don't know where you
expect me to stand though.

10:42.297 --> 10:44.931
It's a packed plane, and
this gentleman took my seat.

10:44.967 --> 10:47.067
Aye, well, he's a Kang fan.
They don't respect anything.

10:47.102 --> 10:48.702
Hey, you talking about us?

10:48.770 --> 10:50.570
Yeah, maybe I am. What
are you gonna do about it?

10:52.671 --> 10:54.407
Okay, let's calm down!

11:02.882 --> 11:03.925
Hey.

11:04.117 --> 11:05.102
Hey!

11:05.102 --> 11:06.670
I was just about to sneak you a water.

11:06.670 --> 11:08.536
I swear, not all dates with me

11:08.572 --> 11:10.505
will end in an epic struggle for survival.

11:10.540 --> 11:12.940
But no promises if we
move into a relationship.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.742
Ronnie, this is crazy. I should go.

11:14.778 --> 11:16.511
I mean, I am the only person on this flight

11:16.580 --> 11:18.580
that doesn't actually need
to be in Vegas, and you seem

11:18.615 --> 11:20.799
- so stressed.
- Don't you dare.

11:20.954 --> 11:23.499
You are the one person I
actually want on this plane.

11:23.653 --> 11:25.269
Ronnie, new problem.

11:25.655 --> 11:28.723
I mean, there was a problem,
but I solved it, so it's fine.

11:28.758 --> 11:31.126
Yeah, the-the two groups of
angry shoulders in the cabin

11:31.161 --> 11:33.561
were getting ready to
fight, but I averted disaster

11:33.597 --> 11:36.060
by pointing out we should
all be supporting the troops.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.600
- It's the ultimate sacrifice.
- They're protecting our freedom.

11:38.668 --> 11:40.168
So they're fine, for now,

11:40.203 --> 11:41.569
although I would keep an eye on them.

11:41.638 --> 11:44.539
As my father once said,
a watched pot never boils.

11:44.926 --> 11:47.597
That's right. My father was the homemaker.

11:50.008 --> 11:51.746
Well, now I have a fight to worry about.

11:51.815 --> 11:53.808
Great, that's just one more thing...

11:56.028 --> 11:57.946
I'll be right back.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.256
When those guys almost
fought, what set them off?

12:01.291 --> 12:02.590
Well, it was a number of factors.

12:02.626 --> 12:04.559
Uh, cultural differences,

12:04.594 --> 12:05.994
performative masculinity,

12:06.062 --> 12:07.428
me. It was... it was me.

12:07.464 --> 12:08.930
Great! Go do that again.

12:08.965 --> 12:09.931
What-what do you mean?

12:09.966 --> 12:12.467
You sweet, devious genius.

12:12.724 --> 12:14.808
If they fight, we have a
reason to kick them off.

12:14.833 --> 12:17.059
Hold on, how am I supposed
to make them that angry?

12:17.107 --> 12:18.995
Just tell them one of those things you say,

12:19.064 --> 12:21.998
like "A-a touchscreen will never
replace the feel of a book."

12:22.033 --> 12:24.111
So you just want to hear a
bunch of men loudly agree?

12:24.111 --> 12:25.120
Go!

12:38.477 --> 12:39.657
I hear you're carrying.

12:39.933 --> 12:40.991
That depends.

12:40.991 --> 12:43.178
Am I talking to Dave or Captain Dave?

12:43.178 --> 12:45.745
I'm just a guy whose
feelings got out of the pen,

12:45.781 --> 12:47.447
and now I'm looking for
some chocolate cowboys

12:47.482 --> 12:49.247
- to round 'em up.
- I've got what you need.

12:52.664 --> 12:53.720
Not here.

12:53.745 --> 12:54.882
I know a place.

12:55.973 --> 12:57.266
Hey, Nichole!

12:57.266 --> 12:59.259
Can you please help me? I'm very thirsty.

12:59.294 --> 13:00.493
I'm sorry, Artem.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.534
Business is booming. I'm all out.

13:04.099 --> 13:06.463
Hey, buddy, you want a sip of this?

13:06.693 --> 13:09.478
Oh, thank you. That's very generous of you.

13:16.916 --> 13:17.869
Oops.

13:18.176 --> 13:20.376
How can you be so cruel?

13:20.746 --> 13:24.080
I'm just a simple man
trying to get to Vegas

13:24.148 --> 13:27.750
so that I may spread the
ashes of my beloved father

13:27.785 --> 13:29.719
in the canals of the Venetian.

13:31.105 --> 13:33.055
Was your dad a trash-humper, too?

13:33.091 --> 13:35.358
Who was your mom, a wadded-up napkin?

13:35.694 --> 13:37.392
Ronnie!

13:40.034 --> 13:41.897
So, I don't want to cause any trouble, uh,

13:41.933 --> 13:44.667
but I believe I heard
some of the Irish fans,

13:44.702 --> 13:47.436
uh, insulting your-your Samoan heritage...

13:47.472 --> 13:49.443
...insulting your Irish heritage...

13:49.443 --> 13:52.575
...and referred to Samoa
as Earth's third nipple.

13:52.610 --> 13:56.412
They also said that Liam Neeson
is aging into an old woman.

13:56.447 --> 13:59.156
...saying that Samoa is barely a Guam.

13:59.584 --> 14:01.584
And they said your music sounds like

14:01.619 --> 14:03.386
a "busted-ass ringtone."

14:03.454 --> 14:05.321
And they said the most common blood type

14:05.356 --> 14:07.857
for a Samoan is chocolate milkshake.

14:12.096 --> 14:13.596
Come on. Seriously, Artem?

14:13.631 --> 14:15.031
You're fighting with a puppet?

14:15.066 --> 14:16.772
Well, he started it.

14:16.772 --> 14:19.568
Miss, I'm as surprised as you are.

14:19.604 --> 14:21.737
I politely explained that my dummy

14:21.773 --> 14:23.506
is too valuable to be stowed.

14:23.541 --> 14:26.143
He just started yelling and sweating at me.

14:26.143 --> 14:28.711
That is untrue! And, yes, I know

14:28.746 --> 14:30.446
I'm doing both things right now,

14:30.481 --> 14:33.149
which doesn't help my case, I know.

14:33.184 --> 14:35.351
Look, I know everyone's going

14:35.386 --> 14:37.353
a little crazy right now, but don't worry.

14:37.388 --> 14:39.455
We're gonna be getting people
off this plane any minute.

14:39.455 --> 14:41.590
I hear you're talking smack, Lucky Charms.

14:41.626 --> 14:43.726
I'm just saying that you
and your wee buddies here

14:43.761 --> 14:46.028
should stop ruining this for
everyone and get off the plane.

14:46.097 --> 14:48.597
I'll send you off this plane in a body bag.

14:48.633 --> 14:49.865
- At least I fit in a body bad.
- You're dead meat.

14:49.901 --> 14:52.234
Hey, stop! Hey, come on, guys. Back off.

14:52.270 --> 14:54.270
I-I don't think you understand
what we're trying to do here.

14:54.305 --> 14:57.506
Look, the whole point of watching MMA,

14:57.542 --> 15:00.576
is to get your aggression out
in a healthy, non-violent way.

15:00.611 --> 15:03.212
Now, for me, that's hate-whisking

15:03.247 --> 15:05.036
a stiff-peaked meringue.

15:05.036 --> 15:07.824
For you guys, that's
watching Kang-McKnickerson.

15:08.306 --> 15:11.653
Now, those guys fight so you don't have to.

15:12.919 --> 15:14.276
That...

15:15.443 --> 15:16.917
actually makes sense.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.918
Okay. We'll let Kang and McKnickerson

15:19.953 --> 15:21.920
settle this for us then, will we?

15:25.039 --> 15:26.215
What just happened?

15:26.477 --> 15:28.577
Ronald, this is not resolved!

15:28.613 --> 15:31.830
Ah, what's wrong? Miss
your mommy, trash-humper?

15:32.158 --> 15:33.449
What did you just do?

15:33.889 --> 15:35.422
Uh, saved the day.

15:35.457 --> 15:36.840
Those guys were about to kill each other.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.373
Yes. That's what we want.

15:38.408 --> 15:39.608
If they fight, we can kick them off.

15:39.643 --> 15:40.976
If we kick them off, we can leave.

15:41.011 --> 15:42.477
Well, if I knew that was the plan,

15:42.513 --> 15:44.779
I still would have stopped it,
because that's a terrible plan.

15:44.815 --> 15:46.448
Physical violence was our
best chance out of here.

15:46.483 --> 15:48.183
Now no one's gonna fight.

15:48.218 --> 15:51.820
For the last time, I'm
tired of your insults!

15:51.855 --> 15:54.309
What the...?

15:55.425 --> 15:57.392
- What are you doing?
- You little... you little...

15:58.371 --> 16:01.532
Oh. I do have a fetish.

16:05.247 --> 16:07.347
Careful I bruise like a peach.

16:08.037 --> 16:09.183
Yeah.

16:09.704 --> 16:11.004
Well, that's three off.

16:11.029 --> 16:13.077
We just need one more person. Any ideas?

16:13.648 --> 16:15.716
- I'll do it.
- Not you, Alan.

16:15.716 --> 16:16.839
Oh. The...

16:17.517 --> 16:20.285
Hey. Hey. So, uh,

16:20.353 --> 16:21.686
obviously, this didn't really

16:21.755 --> 16:23.087
turn out the way I planned.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.122
Uh, the whole "date on a plane" thing

16:24.190 --> 16:25.456
was obviously a bad idea.

16:25.525 --> 16:27.125
- I think I'm gonna go.
- No.

16:27.193 --> 16:28.259
No, Bryan, don't.

16:28.284 --> 16:30.094
I'm-I'm so sorry about before.

16:30.196 --> 16:32.743
Ah, look, y-you're stressed.
It's-it's cool, I get it.

16:32.768 --> 16:35.669
I just, I think it's better
for everybody if I leave.

16:36.069 --> 16:37.368
We'll figure out something else.

16:37.470 --> 16:38.736
I-I'll call you.

16:40.766 --> 16:41.824
Bye.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.696
Is there any chance he meant that?

16:46.199 --> 16:49.601
Oh, sweetie. I think you
know my sarcastic reply.

16:51.772 --> 16:54.372
Good news. We got four
people off the plane.

16:54.595 --> 16:57.129
Well, three people and
one pre-wish Pinocchio.

16:57.197 --> 16:59.214
- But we can take off.
- Great.

16:59.214 --> 17:00.586
Now I have to talk to ATC and remember

17:00.587 --> 17:02.367
that Gwen's not there
because she's with Rod.

17:02.634 --> 17:03.670
Why him?

17:03.927 --> 17:05.268
I've been saving up my miles.

17:05.337 --> 17:07.076
I could have taken her to Poundtown.

17:07.214 --> 17:09.147
Oh, Dave. Okay, look.

17:09.173 --> 17:12.079
When it comes to love, there
are two types of people:

17:12.079 --> 17:13.680
Kangs and McKnickersons.

17:13.959 --> 17:16.545
Kangs play defense,
protecting their hearts,

17:16.602 --> 17:18.368
throwing out the occasional jabs.

17:18.436 --> 17:20.003
But McKnickersons leave themselves open

17:20.071 --> 17:21.771
to taking those bigger swings.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.040
What are you saying? Put
money on Kang in the third?

17:24.109 --> 17:26.343
No. I'm saying you're a McKnickerson.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.012
You're always throwing emotional haymakers,

17:28.037 --> 17:29.298
which leaves you open

17:29.298 --> 17:31.699
to some pretty painful gut
punches, but that's okay.

17:31.767 --> 17:34.751
Because when you connect,
you're gonna connect big.

17:34.883 --> 17:36.036
You're gonna find love.

17:36.452 --> 17:37.904
You're too good of a guy not to.

17:38.848 --> 17:40.801
You know, I've been
piloting planes for so long,

17:40.801 --> 17:42.776
sometimes I forget how
to pilot my own life.

17:43.370 --> 17:44.870
Okay, but don't say stuff like that,

17:44.939 --> 17:46.669
because it makes me feel
like I'm wasting my time.

17:47.009 --> 17:48.015
Hmm.

17:50.711 --> 17:52.911
Well, Dave, I'm back with you.

17:52.936 --> 17:54.403
Love is the worst.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.482
Bryan did everything
he could to make it work

17:56.550 --> 17:58.350
and I still screwed it up.

17:58.730 --> 18:01.320
Maybe it's not the job, maybe it's us.

18:01.388 --> 18:03.155
Hmm. Might be us, but it's not me.

18:03.224 --> 18:05.491
Sorry, Ronnie. The bitter
Captain Dave caterpillar

18:05.559 --> 18:08.093
has emerged from his grief
cocoon as a hopeful butterfly

18:08.162 --> 18:10.195
looking for a sexy flower to pollinate.

18:10.220 --> 18:11.899
Bees pollinate, stupid.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.416
Butterflies do it, too.

18:13.441 --> 18:15.200
- They're just less efficient.
- You're a traitor.

18:15.225 --> 18:17.615
Alan, do you have any
Dave drawings in that pile?

18:18.005 --> 18:19.158
Um...

18:21.170 --> 18:22.407
Is this a nude?

18:22.432 --> 18:23.570
I didn't pose for that.

18:23.911 --> 18:25.605
You didn't <i> not</i> pose for it.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.420
Where did everyone go?

18:35.489 --> 18:36.588
You'll never believe this.

18:36.613 --> 18:37.666
The fight's off.

18:37.691 --> 18:38.891
Kang missed the weigh-in.

18:38.934 --> 18:40.269
He was on the Jackpot flight out of Tampa.

18:40.294 --> 18:41.760
They never even left the gate.

18:41.862 --> 18:43.072
We're not the worst.

18:43.072 --> 18:44.396
Bye, guys. I'll see you next week.

18:44.532 --> 18:45.631
Wait. You're out, too?

18:45.699 --> 18:46.865
Don't you have to work this weekend?

18:46.934 --> 18:48.400
Not anymore. I made a fortune today.

18:48.469 --> 18:49.635
Which reminds me,

18:49.703 --> 18:51.136
this is for your troubles.

18:51.205 --> 18:52.171
Bye.

18:53.662 --> 18:56.054
We're all gonna be working
for her one day, aren't we?

19:00.197 --> 19:01.721
I know this sounds crazy,

19:01.721 --> 19:03.914
but, um, that's actually my seat.

19:10.825 --> 19:12.758
- Ugh.
- Flight 334...

19:12.827 --> 19:15.060
Remind me never to run
out of ink in front of you.

19:16.632 --> 19:18.859
Do you fancy a-a drink and a talk?

19:18.955 --> 19:22.000
I don't know if I want to talk,
but I definitely want a drink.

19:22.069 --> 19:23.769
Okay, perfect. Well, how about this:

19:23.838 --> 19:25.204
you finish whatever you're doing here,

19:25.272 --> 19:26.505
and I'll meet you at the bar.

19:26.739 --> 19:27.968
Yeah, I'd like that.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.168
Okay.

19:34.385 --> 19:36.210
Excuse me, miss, is this
what you're looking for?

19:36.235 --> 19:37.166
Bryan.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.718
Hi. Uh, wh-what are you doing here?

19:39.787 --> 19:42.354
We said we'd figure out
things later, and I figured out

19:42.423 --> 19:44.189
that if I bought a ticket on Southwest,

19:44.537 --> 19:46.982
they'd get me here in half
the time as it takes Jackpot.

19:47.195 --> 19:49.462
Yes, but do they also lose your bags?

19:50.080 --> 19:52.327
I thought that if we can't make a date work

19:52.327 --> 19:54.827
out in the world, or on a plane,

19:55.413 --> 19:58.464
the least I could do is take
you to dinner in Terminal Three?

20:09.377 --> 20:10.710
- You still need this?
- No.

20:10.778 --> 20:12.345
Great.

20:14.349 --> 20:15.914
God, the airport has so many good options.

20:15.939 --> 20:16.928
I know.

20:16.953 --> 20:18.251
Love is the worst.

20:20.940 --> 20:22.152
I know, buddy.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.500
Rip these up, it might help.

20:26.980 --> 20:28.246
Who am I tearing up?

20:28.475 --> 20:30.378
I don't know. Alan sucks at art.

20:35.894 --> 20:37.670
_

20:38.053 --> 20:39.417
Oh, excuse me.

20:39.486 --> 20:40.552
Oh, hey, there, eh.

20:40.594 --> 20:41.933
This is my first time to Vegas.

20:41.958 --> 20:43.355
Do you want to know the rules about hockey?

20:43.423 --> 20:44.756
What's your name, eh? You got to speak up.

20:44.825 --> 20:46.725
I blew an eardrum out at a
Rush show a few years back,

20:46.793 --> 20:48.860
and then I took a puck to the other ear.

20:48.929 --> 20:50.729
Oh, bit of a shy guy, huh?

20:50.754 --> 20:52.233
That's all right. I'll do all the talking.

20:52.275 --> 20:53.665
I got a lot to talk aboot.

20:53.734 --> 20:55.467
You ever have poutine? I don't like it.

20:55.535 --> 20:56.707
But I eat it.

20:57.222 --> 20:58.408
Ronnie!

20:59.305 --> 21:05.919
