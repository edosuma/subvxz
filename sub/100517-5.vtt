WEBVTT

00:37.162 --> 00:39.205
You don't think
maybe you should have told me

00:39.289 --> 00:42.834
what your psycho girlfriend was up to
before you asked to partner up?

00:42.917 --> 00:45.211
You didn't need to know. I need 'trodes.

00:45.295 --> 00:47.422
You've returned.
Thank heavens you're not off-world.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.758
Off-world? We had a deal.

00:49.841 --> 00:53.803
You lying piece of shit. You were never
gonna help me find my brother.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.639
You were just buying time,
so you and she could get off planet.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.224
-Sir, if I may?
-You've said enough.

00:58.308 --> 00:59.184
I found these.

00:59.267 --> 01:02.729
Upload me to the Renouncer's construct.
There's only one Founder left.

01:03.271 --> 01:06.107
Konrad Harlan,
he's gonna tell me what they did to Quell.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.777
-On the subject of Miss Falco--
-I said not to fuck with me, Kovacs.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.071
I warned you.
Your reward just got higher.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.199
I don't remember the Protectorate
being too forgiving of people

01:14.282 --> 01:17.285
who partner with terrorists,
even if they change their minds.

01:17.368 --> 01:21.164
Now, she's gonna go after him in VR.
When she does, I need you to track her.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.295
That will not be necessary.

01:27.921 --> 01:31.633
As I was trying to say,
we already know where Miss Falconer is.

01:31.716 --> 01:32.759
She is here.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.052
What?

01:34.135 --> 01:36.346
Here, as in this hotel?

01:36.429 --> 01:37.889
You'll find her upstairs.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.726
Perhaps you might wanna give the lady
time to freshen up.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.436
She was in quite a state when she arrived.

02:02.580 --> 02:03.498
Quell?

02:25.395 --> 02:26.521
Quell, it's me.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.387
It happened again.

03:01.097 --> 03:01.931
I know.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.078
<i>I've had enough</i>
<i>of this VR recuperation suite,</i>

03:24.162 --> 03:25.580
<i>I'm ready to get back out.</i>

03:25.663 --> 03:29.125
<i>That mission</i>
<i>ended almost 300 years ago.</i>

03:30.168 --> 03:32.795
<i>Your squad, they're all gone.</i>

03:32.879 --> 03:34.589
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

03:34.672 --> 03:36.299
The Protectorate backs up stacks

03:36.382 --> 03:39.552
of any soldier they deem valuable enough
to preserve.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.804
Keeps copies on ice.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.307
You were one of them.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.268
You left me on ice
for three goddamn centuries?

03:47.769 --> 03:49.354
I had to wait for the right time,

03:49.437 --> 03:52.523
for a situation extreme enough
to warrant spinning you up.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.193
A lot's changed.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.779
Including me.

03:59.113 --> 04:02.617
They gave me a new sleeve
and a new name to go with it,

04:03.159 --> 04:04.702
Ivan Carrera.

04:05.036 --> 04:09.290
And this is Takeshi Kovacs now.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.211
The most wanted man on Harlan's.

04:13.753 --> 04:14.921
You double sleeved me.

04:15.004 --> 04:18.341
-I had to break a few rules.
-I get caught, they'll real death us both.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.926
Not if you do your job right.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.637
You want me to hunt myself down?

04:23.429 --> 04:25.807
Why? What happened to me?

04:25.890 --> 04:26.891
She did.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.188
Quellcrist Falconer.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.527
You crossed paths outside Stronghold.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.821
She got to you, infected you.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.781
You went AWOL...

04:43.032 --> 04:44.450
joined her rebellion.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.368
Bullshit.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.120
Why would I do that?

04:47.203 --> 04:50.498
I've lived with that question
from the moment you turned your back

04:50.581 --> 04:52.625
on everything you believed in.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.546
You were under my command.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.716
It was my responsibility to guide you.
I failed.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.009
It won't happen again.

05:01.718 --> 05:05.138
Eliminate Falconer and Kovacs now.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.432
And take back your life.

05:07.515 --> 05:10.685
Reclaim your place in this world.

05:10.768 --> 05:11.769
A second chance.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.814
The Kovacs you became
destroyed everything.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.066
Everyone you held dear.

05:18.693 --> 05:19.527
Everyone?

05:23.698 --> 05:24.615
Your sister.

05:26.159 --> 05:26.993
Reileen.

05:27.076 --> 05:27.910
What did he do?

05:28.536 --> 05:29.746
What did he do to Rei?

05:30.830 --> 05:31.706
He killed her.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.918
Walked away with a pardon
and a shit-ton of credits.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.128
I'm sorry, son.

05:46.721 --> 05:47.847
When do I decant?

05:49.140 --> 05:49.974
Soon.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.020
My team is arranging your transfer
as we speak.

05:59.484 --> 06:03.404
What do you think? Like the improvements
we made to the sleeve?

06:06.866 --> 06:08.284
-I do.
-Meet your team.

06:08.743 --> 06:11.496
The Wedge. They're going to take
their orders from you.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.206
The needlecast explosion left us dark,

06:13.289 --> 06:15.833
-there are no reinforcements.
-And Kovacs and Falconer?

06:15.917 --> 06:18.920
The top Yakuza boss on Harlan's
was real deathed last night.

06:19.003 --> 06:22.590
We believe he was trying to help them
jump planet. I say we start there.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.551
-What do we know about the weapon?
-Nothing.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.303
Except we want it.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.930
I have to go see the Governor.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.474
I'll circle back when I can.

06:33.309 --> 06:35.561
Coming back from that long on ice
has gotta be tough.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.272
If you need me to take lead--

06:38.356 --> 06:41.109
I've been running ops since before
your grandfather's balls dropped.

06:41.859 --> 06:44.153
I'll let you know if I need someone
to handle the paperwork.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.740
Arm up, we're moving out.

06:52.328 --> 06:55.123
If Mr. Kovacs lied,
it was to benefit Miss Falconer.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.793
-We don't know what's wrong with her.
-I do. She's nuts.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.337
Her DHF is totally screwed.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.507
Her erratic behavior is most likely caused
by personality fragmentation.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.592
Her consciousness may have split.

07:06.676 --> 07:10.012
I've seen that in Archaeologues
who re-sleeved too many times.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.889
Trauma is also a cause.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.351
It's possible she can be fixed.

07:15.810 --> 07:16.644
Doubt it.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.396
There's no cure for p-frag.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.566
Once the mind cracks like that,
it goes from bad to worse.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.152
Much like our options here.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.157
Poe, your condition
is not the same as hers.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.658
But it's deteriorating.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.995
I must be of service, while I still can.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.496
How do you propose to do that?

07:35.580 --> 07:37.665
By doing what Mr. Kovacs suggested.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.334
Ah! We cannot administer treatment

07:40.418 --> 07:42.628
unless we identify
the cause of her distress.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.214
I must infiltrate
the Renouncers' construct

07:45.298 --> 07:46.799
and question Konrad Harlan.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.135
He may hold the key to what ails her.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.219
That's too risky.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.805
Miss Falconer and I are kindred.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.517
To give up on her would be akin
to giving up on myself.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.479
Something you just recently convinced me
was premature.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.315
Yes, but you don't know the toll
it will take on your system.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.233
Do you expect me to stand by
and do nothing?

08:07.028 --> 08:09.238
Is that what you did
with the Archaeologues?

08:11.407 --> 08:13.493
You can't save humans from themselves.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.037
That's why you don't get close to them.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.873
They're always killing each other.
It's how it is.

08:18.956 --> 08:22.418
I'm not going to save all of them.
I'm merely endeavoring to save one!

08:22.835 --> 08:24.295
And what do I tell Kovacs?

08:24.795 --> 08:28.382
Oh, he's no longer my employer.
I don't require his permission.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.468
All I need is for you...

08:32.136 --> 08:33.429
to wish me luck.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.016
Good...

08:37.683 --> 08:38.518
luck.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.396
There must be another way
to cast off.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.024
There isn't. All private bays
go through the main hub.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.276
Why would I destroy
our only way off the planet?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.613
Maybe part of you wants to stay.
There's one Founder left.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.989
It's Konrad Harlan.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.282
The Founders are no one to me.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.493
They must have done something
to make you act like this.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.370
What? What did they do?

08:57.453 --> 08:59.413
-I need answers, just like you.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.124
I can't keep waking up
with blood on my hands.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.584
Quell, I'm not blaming you.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.295
Tanaseda was your friend.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.589
He was helping us, and I killed him.

09:08.673 --> 09:12.385
-How can you not blame me for that?
-Because he told me not to.

09:14.011 --> 09:16.097
I don't know how,
but he knew what was gonna happen.

09:16.597 --> 09:20.142
The last thing he said was, "Forgive her."
And I'm sure as hell trying.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.562
Well, if you figure out how,

09:23.521 --> 09:24.397
let me know.

09:41.455 --> 09:42.873
Where's his stack?

09:43.207 --> 09:44.875
Killer's pocket, I imagine.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.881
The killer uploaded it and opened a VR.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.049
How do you know that?

09:52.133 --> 09:53.426
It's what I would do.

09:54.135 --> 09:57.847
This is my great grandfather's property.
You have no right to be here.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.558
We're the Protectorate.
We have every right to be here.

10:01.058 --> 10:04.145
-We're gonna find whoever did this.
-It's obvious who did this.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.815
Takeshi fucking Kovacs, you moron.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.651
I warned Tanaseda not to trust him.

10:10.735 --> 10:11.861
So this is your fault?

10:12.820 --> 10:13.821
The fuck did you just say?

10:13.904 --> 10:16.198
You knew Kovacs would do this
and you did nothing?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.493
Maybe if your <i>sosofu </i>respected you

10:19.577 --> 10:22.455
more than a 300-year-old re-run
in a stolen sleeve, you could've--

10:22.538 --> 10:25.625
Shut your mouth,
you skin-dipped dog fucker,

10:26.375 --> 10:29.295
-or I'll--
-Do nothing, like you did before.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.841
Tell us how to find him
and we'll do what you can't.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.932
I don't know where that fossil Envoy is,

10:42.433 --> 10:44.185
but when I find him,

10:44.894 --> 10:46.312
you'll be the first to know.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.613
He was lying.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.281
You let him go.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.867
Who says I'm letting him go?

11:09.710 --> 11:10.795
That's her.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.880
Which means Takeshi Kovacs--

11:12.963 --> 11:14.256
Is not the Meth-killer.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.051
She is.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.310
I want that footage locked down.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.604
I encrypted it on your server,

11:29.105 --> 11:30.815
but that doesn't change the facts.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.983
The leader of The Uprising is alive.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.528
She just cut off all interstellar travel,

11:35.611 --> 11:37.321
trapped an entire planet.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.490
That's not something you can hide,

11:39.990 --> 11:40.866
or bury,

11:41.242 --> 11:43.869
or strap to a rocket,
hoping it will disappear.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.708
And when this gets out, you'll have more
than your Cartel to deal with.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.002
What do you know about my Cartel?

11:53.921 --> 11:56.882
I know they live in fear
of Falconer's revolution.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.468
I know when it ignites,

11:59.552 --> 12:02.930
they will lose any vestige of faith
they have left in your leadership.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.351
I know the Colony Charter
allows for a vote of no confidence.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.646
So how is it, Governor,

12:11.689 --> 12:13.858
to feel the ground shifting
under your feet?

12:20.865 --> 12:22.742
Whiskey, ice.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.077
Where's Poe?

12:25.161 --> 12:27.538
Poor bastard
went to find Konrad Harlan for you.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.749
-I didn't tell him to do that.
-But he did.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.876
That kind of loyalty is hard to come by.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.919
-So why won't he reboot?

12:36.756 --> 12:37.882
Turn that up.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.095
<i>People of Harlan's World,</i>

12:43.637 --> 12:46.474
<i>the Protectorate wants us</i>
<i>to cower in fear,</i>

12:46.932 --> 12:48.267
<i>but we will not fear them.</i>

12:48.726 --> 12:50.561
<i>We've intercepted this footage.</i>

12:50.644 --> 12:52.938
<i>Quellcrist Falconer lives.</i>

12:53.814 --> 12:57.359
<i>The ceasefire is over.</i>
<i>Falconer herself struck the first blow.</i>

12:59.236 --> 13:00.988
Fuck me sideways.

13:01.071 --> 13:04.909
<i>To our enemies, I say surrender or die.</i>

13:06.285 --> 13:09.079
<i>It is time we finish what she started.</i>

13:10.164 --> 13:12.333
Kemp just lit a match to a powder keg.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.419
Good luck when it blows.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.046
I'm done.

13:17.671 --> 13:18.798
That's an invitation.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.760
We're not safe in Harlan's territory,
but if we can get her to the Quellists...

13:25.554 --> 13:26.764
You wanna go to Kemp?

13:27.139 --> 13:30.100
It's the best way to protect her.
Hide behind enemy lines.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.603
They've held off the Protectorate
for decades.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.605
You can't. It's impossible.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.023
There are checkpoints everywhere!

13:36.106 --> 13:37.107
I know a way.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.401
Then I'm coming with you.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.946
My brother was working with those zealots.

13:42.029 --> 13:45.407
If you won't help me find him,
then you can take me to someone who can.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.117
You'll never make it out.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.078
Praetorians are swarming the city.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.413
She's right. It's too dangerous.

13:51.956 --> 13:52.873
I'm going alone.

14:04.218 --> 14:05.761
Target acquired.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.054
Eighty meters ahead.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.640
Copy. Moving out.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.564
-I could turn on you.
-You won't.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.065
She might, actually.

14:18.148 --> 14:21.402
I can find Kemp myself.
It's safer for all of you if I leave.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.319
Absolutely not.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.196
This is like the Archaeologues
all over again.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.949
I can't control it.
There's no reason it couldn't be you.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.450
You should listen to her.

14:30.703 --> 14:31.537
Quiet.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.125
-Save Kovacs for me.

14:50.764 --> 14:52.725
We're here for Takeshi Kovacs!

14:54.643 --> 14:55.644
This is his hotel.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.981
I don't know the name, mister.

14:59.523 --> 15:00.941
We're under new management.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.027
-What the fuck--

15:07.698 --> 15:08.949
- Left.
- Clear.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.993
Where's Takeshi Kovacs?

15:11.076 --> 15:11.994
I don't know.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.163
Popular guy.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.417
You don't look like the type
to drink on the job.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.716
What do you know?

15:26.634 --> 15:27.509
My favorite.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.974
They're gonna be on our tail.
We need to get word to Kemp.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.936
I've hunted enough Quellist bounties.
I know how they communicate.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.271
-I can get a message to him.
-Tell him we're coming.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.357
We'll set the meet point
once we've cleared the city.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.359
-I don't wanna walk into an ambush.
-Got it.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.944
We still need to get past
the checkpoints.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.738
We can use the tunnels.
I know an access point that's abandoned.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.990
If we wanna go underground,
we'll need supplies.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.702
Ex-con who installed my coils owns
an augment shop not far from here.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.329
Old bastard always has the best gear.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.414
And this old bastard won't mind
if we help ourselves?

15:57.498 --> 15:59.249
No. He owes me one.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.221
Sorry to keep you waiting.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.556
We've never had an AI renounce before.

16:14.848 --> 16:17.393
Jack Soul Brasil himself
wants to conduct your interview.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.228
Mr. Soul Brasil himself,

16:19.311 --> 16:21.313
the man who created this very construct?

16:21.397 --> 16:23.983
He only meets
with the most important converts.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.693
-Who does?

16:25.776 --> 16:29.446
I know, it's hard to believe,
meeting the prophet right out of the gate.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.990
How thrilling.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.119
Should I...

16:35.411 --> 16:37.162
He's waiting in the garden
on the other side.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.247
Hmm.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.881
Only those free from flesh
and pure in spirit

16:47.965 --> 16:50.217
may find their way through
the maze unscathed.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.144
Would you happen to have a map?

17:09.403 --> 17:10.779
Good stuff's over here.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.825
We're gonna need a beacon to signal Kemp.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.872
That's my contact right now.
They must have word from him.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.917
I bet he's excited to meet his hero.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.004
He shouldn't get his hopes up.

17:27.504 --> 17:28.756
You should tell him that.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.560
They're ready to send an escort.
The beacons are on the bottom.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.397
Take your hands off my shit.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.068
Overcharged blaster on wide beam.

17:49.526 --> 17:51.320
It'll take your heads off at the stack.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.239
So keep your thieving hands
where I can see 'em.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.408
Put the gun down, Dad.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.079
Trepp?

18:04.124 --> 18:06.794
Like I said, I don't know the person
you're looking for.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.837
Your kind has come a long way.

18:09.671 --> 18:12.841
And you've evolved so much
that you've forgotten.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.137
We never made you to be free.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.223
Command override.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.851
The fruit of the tree belongs to the tree.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.646
Root access enabled.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.232
Good. Now we can talk.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.901
Where's Takeshi Kovacs?

18:32.236 --> 18:35.906
Takeshi Kovacs is the owner
of The Nevermore AI Hotel,

18:35.989 --> 18:37.950
formerly known as the Happy Face.

18:38.033 --> 18:38.992
Tell me where he went.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.746
Information not available.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.249
Is Falconer with him?

18:50.045 --> 18:52.798
Information not available.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.258
You're protecting him. Why?

18:57.803 --> 18:59.471
They killed the Archaeologues.

19:01.014 --> 19:01.890
I did nothing.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.310
I won't do nothing again.

19:05.769 --> 19:06.645
How noble.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.689
Command override.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.778
To the mind that is still,
the universe surrenders.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.906
Where is Kovacs?

19:19.158 --> 19:22.744
Information not available.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.080
She erased the files.
They covered their tracks.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.081
We're losing time.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.251
Access your memory store,
read me your last command input.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.254
Dump memory to external data coil.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.339
Serial number...

19:35.549 --> 19:37.301
6269.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.677
Track the serial number.

19:38.760 --> 19:39.928
Who installed the coil?

19:42.973 --> 19:44.183
Lukas Imani,

19:45.017 --> 19:47.728
-owner of Imani's Augmented Repairs.
-Stop.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.024
I don't know about you,

19:53.233 --> 19:54.818
but I'm ready to go shopping.

20:02.826 --> 20:06.288
No word from you for a year,
and I find you robbing me?

20:06.371 --> 20:09.750
This from a criminal
who spent half my childhood on ice?

20:09.833 --> 20:11.293
My eyesight may be weak,

20:11.919 --> 20:14.630
but I'm not so blind
I can't see who you're with.

20:14.713 --> 20:17.174
-Myka and TJ know about this?
-Don't talk about my family.

20:17.591 --> 20:21.136
First, Anil gets caught up
in this Quellist crap, now you.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.597
I must have screwed you up
worse than I thought.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.517
You knew Anil was a Quellist?

20:29.144 --> 20:31.730
He came by a few months ago,

20:31.813 --> 20:34.942
looking for mining gear,
said Kemp gave him some mission.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.361
He didn't tell you?

20:39.321 --> 20:40.322
No.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.868
Well, you were more of a parent to him
than I was.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.120
He probably couldn't face the judgment.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.498
Good talk.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.708
-Let's not do this again.
-Trepp.

20:52.918 --> 20:56.964
Don't make the same mistakes I made,
running off, chasing trouble.

20:57.047 --> 21:00.133
I don't give up on my family.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.889
I'll bring back the gear.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.023
Mr. Poe, welcome.

21:15.107 --> 21:19.778
Jack Soul Brasil, I have been waiting
a long time for an AI devotee.

21:19.861 --> 21:22.823
I would have arrived sooner if the route
didn't have so many dead ends.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.700
Oh, wise words.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.952
You've always been light years
ahead of us organics

21:27.035 --> 21:28.745
when it comes to seeing the truth.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.373
It took me much longer.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.917
I'm afraid, I was on the verge
of becoming a Meth.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.962
Enough credits for endless lifetimes.
But then I...

21:37.337 --> 21:40.590
saw it, finally, and gave it all up.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.386
-It must've been quite a vision.
-Hmm. I'm sure you see it too.

21:44.469 --> 21:48.307
Reality is just an agreed upon illusion.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.813
If you can see it, smell it,

21:54.896 --> 21:56.440
who's to say what's real?

22:02.404 --> 22:04.614
It is a very good construct.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.533
Well, everything's a construct.

22:06.908 --> 22:09.578
Out there, in here,
we're just aware of it.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.456
Violence, war, suffering,

22:12.539 --> 22:14.666
they have no place in the garden
that I have programmed.

22:14.750 --> 22:19.504
And that is why so many have come,
seeking refuge.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.550
Is that when Mr. Harlan renounced?

22:24.509 --> 22:26.386
Are you acquainted with Mr. Harlan?

22:26.470 --> 22:29.806
Oh, he's rather a hero of mine.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.975
Founder of his own world.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.145
Much like you.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.440
Is it true that he's here?

22:41.401 --> 22:42.402
You'll meet him one day.

22:42.486 --> 22:45.864
But first, let's get you acquainted
with the rules of our new world.

22:45.947 --> 22:49.618
I don't think you understand
the boundless happiness

22:49.701 --> 22:53.121
that can be created
simply from your own mind.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.584
If it is lost, it can be restored.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.464
Hello, Eddie.

23:04.299 --> 23:05.634
Miss Elizabeth.

23:08.136 --> 23:08.970
But...

23:11.223 --> 23:12.182
how?

23:13.100 --> 23:14.976
You were thinking of what was lost.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.312
There it is.

23:19.231 --> 23:23.193
She is a recording I stored,
a message merely repeating.

23:23.276 --> 23:26.988
Maybe it's time to say something new.
It was so good of you to come.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.075
And I missed having my best friend
beside me.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.537
Why don't I show you around?

23:34.704 --> 23:35.747
By all means.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.208
Lead the way!

23:57.060 --> 23:58.061
This way.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.710
It's corroded. Give me a sec.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.301
I heard what you said...

24:30.760 --> 24:32.596
about your brother being a Quellist.

24:34.181 --> 24:37.100
Whatever role I played
in what happened to him, I'm sorry.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.482
Yeah, well, he never told me.

24:50.655 --> 24:51.823
I've been watching you.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.075
You're not anyone's follower.

24:56.953 --> 24:58.955
Don't take anyone's side but my own.

24:59.664 --> 25:00.999
Not the Protectorate.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.001
Not the Quellists.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.378
-And certainly not your boy over there.
-Good.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.298
Because I need you to do something.

25:10.842 --> 25:13.011
If I start to lose myself again...

25:16.890 --> 25:18.350
You want me to shoot you?

25:21.937 --> 25:23.480
That ammo's lethal.

25:24.439 --> 25:27.859
If the hit doesn't kill you,
the poison will.

25:28.735 --> 25:29.945
He won't do it.

25:30.946 --> 25:31.780
He can't.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.284
I need someone who can.

25:42.791 --> 25:43.708
Let's go!

25:54.636 --> 25:56.179
Uh, we're closed.

25:57.931 --> 25:59.099
Now you are.

25:59.182 --> 26:01.393
We're looking for the owner
of a data coil.

26:01.476 --> 26:03.979
Serial number was registered to this shop.

26:04.437 --> 26:06.189
My memory's not what it used to be.

26:06.731 --> 26:07.941
We can help with that.

26:10.819 --> 26:11.695
Hold him.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.698
Who'd they put those coils in? Huh?

26:15.240 --> 26:16.575
Who were they here with?

26:19.911 --> 26:22.706
-Have you seen the Last Envoy?
-Okay.

26:23.206 --> 26:24.165
Okay.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.001
They were here.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.503
Yeah. I knew it'd come back to you.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.005
What'd they say?

26:31.006 --> 26:31.965
They said,

26:33.383 --> 26:35.135
"You should go fuck yourself."

26:39.848 --> 26:41.516
You want me to spin you down, old man?

26:41.933 --> 26:44.311
I've spent a lot of years on ice.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.105
Every time I spin back up,
it's a new world.

26:47.606 --> 26:51.610
Everyone's got new faces, or they're gone
like they were never here at all.

26:51.693 --> 26:55.655
The rest are older, angrier.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.782
Might be a relief to go back.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.620
I was never much of a man.

27:02.871 --> 27:04.539
Not much of a father either.

27:05.832 --> 27:07.959
But there's time to make up for it.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.504
And the Lord knows I can take punishment.

27:13.298 --> 27:15.258
I'm not telling you shit.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.521
Cool emblem.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.273
What the hell are you doing?

27:30.774 --> 27:32.067
I know where they went.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.778
They came here for supplies,
they're taking the mining tunnels.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.238
There's hundreds of entrances
to those tunnels.

27:37.322 --> 27:41.076
But he only grew up playing near one.
We go now, we can catch up with him.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.536
This asshole was just wasting our time.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.472
- Who made this tunnel system?
- Does it look familiar?

28:02.555 --> 28:03.390
Should it?

28:04.349 --> 28:06.476
Looks like an abandoned mining operation.

28:06.559 --> 28:08.520
We stripped these walls,
but we didn't build 'em.

28:08.603 --> 28:11.898
These tunnels were dug by the Elders.
You built the first stacks

28:11.981 --> 28:14.818
after discovering Elder artifacts
in a place just like this.

28:19.572 --> 28:21.783
I hear screaming.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.289
It's not real. Stay with me.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.547
It's okay. It's okay.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.639
Okay. You're okay.

28:45.181 --> 28:47.684
-Close your eyes. Breathe.

28:50.770 --> 28:54.733
- Picture somewhere safe.
-Nowhere is safe. Nowhere.

28:54.816 --> 28:58.278
There's a lake, surrounded by mountains,
endless sky.

28:58.361 --> 29:01.072
When you're there, you're free.

29:02.490 --> 29:03.867
She should rest.

29:04.993 --> 29:05.869
It's okay.

29:07.370 --> 29:10.081
We should keep going.

29:14.919 --> 29:15.920
Thanks for that.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.548
TJ still has panic attacks.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.593
They worked this time, but, Kovacs,

29:21.676 --> 29:25.430
if she's got p-frag,
she won't be stable for long.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.475
She's got a war
going on inside of her head.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.019
What if the wrong side wins?

29:40.195 --> 29:42.781
There's more to renouncing
than letting go of a body.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.243
This is where everyone's journey starts.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.456
Practicing horticulture?

29:52.582 --> 29:55.752
Jack Soul Brasil found that tending
the garden allows newcomers

29:55.835 --> 29:58.713
to focus on the new life
they're creating here in virtual,

29:58.880 --> 30:00.840
letting go of old sorrows.

30:03.676 --> 30:04.677
Hmm.

30:13.269 --> 30:14.437
Beautiful, isn't it?

30:21.110 --> 30:22.111
My apologies.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.031
I'm still having trouble processing.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.826
My mind isn't what it was.

30:29.577 --> 30:30.954
I was broken once,

30:31.746 --> 30:32.914
until I met you.

30:36.626 --> 30:37.627
What are you doing?

30:38.127 --> 30:39.254
What you did for me.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.262
-Ah.
-You created a world where I felt whole.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.682
The least I can do is return the favor.

30:50.765 --> 30:52.350
This feels too good to be true.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.644
Perhaps, I am just going mad.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.564
What's better? To be sane or to be happy?

30:58.731 --> 30:59.649
Hmm.

31:02.569 --> 31:03.528
Who are they?

31:03.862 --> 31:07.240
Some of our veterans.
They practice an elite form of meditation.

31:07.323 --> 31:08.366
I nearly forgot.

31:08.741 --> 31:10.994
-I arrived here on a mission.
-Are you leaving?

31:11.077 --> 31:13.746
Perhaps you could join me?
We could follow them together.

31:13.830 --> 31:16.291
We're not allowed
in the private meditation temples.

31:16.374 --> 31:19.043
Hmm, not dressed like this.

31:19.460 --> 31:23.089
Then again... this world is as we make it.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.174
Not entirely.

31:25.925 --> 31:26.968
There are rules.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.387
Miss Elizabeth,
there is someone else that is broken,

31:29.470 --> 31:31.306
and she is in desperate need.

31:32.348 --> 31:36.311
And I believe Konrad Harlan
holds the knowledge to unlock the cure.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.106
-Then we must find him.
-Yeah.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.908
They detonated charges
so no one could follow.

31:49.991 --> 31:52.160
So much for golden boy's bright idea.

32:03.463 --> 32:07.675
- <i>Do you trust me, Rei?</i>
-<i> I trust you, Tak.</i> <i>Every...</i>

32:21.147 --> 32:23.066
There's an entrance two prefects over.

32:23.149 --> 32:26.069
We'd still be ten steps behind.
We need to get out ahead.

32:26.903 --> 32:29.238
Those tunnels run for miles.
He could surface anywhere.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.783
It's not about him, it's about her.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.118
He wants to protect her.

32:34.827 --> 32:36.913
He'll take her to a place she feels safe.

32:38.706 --> 32:39.791
We cut them off here.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.044
Okay, Magellan, which way?

32:45.254 --> 32:46.214
This way.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.300
Maybe it's time we get above ground.
We're outside of the city.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.970
-Not far enough.
-There's nothing but wilderness out there.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.138
What does it matter
where we signal Kemp from?

32:54.222 --> 32:56.516
Because he already has a destination
in mind.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.142
Stronghold.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.063
I already know the terrain,
every entrance, every exit.

33:02.146 --> 33:03.773
We can camp there while we wait for Kemp.

33:03.856 --> 33:06.693
This isn't about Kemp, this is about me.

33:06.776 --> 33:09.070
I read the history. That's where we met.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.280
You think taking me there
will make me remember.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.574
You always got your own agenda.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.368
She remembered the bridge.

33:15.910 --> 33:18.246
Maybe a familiar place
would trigger something more.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.248
That isn't a plan. It's a pipe dream.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.666
I'm trying to help you.

33:21.749 --> 33:22.750
What if you can't?

33:34.637 --> 33:36.806
How do we fix this?
Falconer's back from the dead.

33:36.889 --> 33:40.601
Markov was driven from his tower,
someone set fire to Yamura's estate.

33:40.685 --> 33:43.730
I want my own protection detail.
What about the Wedge?

33:44.939 --> 33:47.775
My soldiers
are not your personal bodyguards.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.527
The Wedge is tracking Falconer.

33:50.737 --> 33:54.657
Colonel, the safety of this Cartel
is this planet's top priority.

33:54.741 --> 33:58.161
The Protectorate's resources
must be deployed for the good of us.

33:59.078 --> 34:01.497
People are agitating in the streets.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.500
It's not the time
to fight among ourselves.

34:04.625 --> 34:06.419
We must come together.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.546
Our security depends on it.

34:08.629 --> 34:12.884
That is why I'm invoking Provision 532
of the Colony Charter.

34:13.593 --> 34:15.261
You want to declare martial law?

34:16.763 --> 34:19.974
You don't have to do that.
I have the situation in hand.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.018
Your words are not good enough.

34:22.101 --> 34:24.353
The Uprising has been reignited.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.689
The situation is precarious.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.400
We need to take action now.

34:29.484 --> 34:33.780
Ratify my decision
and I direct all military on Harlan's,

34:33.863 --> 34:35.865
including Protectorate forces.

34:35.948 --> 34:37.742
I second the invocation.

34:37.825 --> 34:40.703
If you do this,
there will be no check on her power.

34:40.787 --> 34:44.248
I move that Provision 532
be enacted, effective immediately.

34:46.709 --> 34:48.419
Good. We're in agreement.

34:50.838 --> 34:52.090
Colonel Carrera.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.223
Yes, Governor.

35:03.476 --> 35:07.355
I'm placing all members present
under house arrest for their own safety.

35:07.897 --> 35:11.025
All activities of this body
are suspended until further notice.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.278
- On your feet.
-Don't touch me!

35:14.362 --> 35:17.657
-You don't have the authority.
-You gave it to her, you imbecile.

35:17.740 --> 35:20.993
You think I didn't know you were plotting
against me with Dugan?

35:21.744 --> 35:23.913
Enjoy your protective detail.

35:26.874 --> 35:27.792
You did this.

35:29.877 --> 35:33.214
You released the footage of Falconer.
You wanted people to panic.

35:34.423 --> 35:35.800
You brought up the Charter.

35:35.883 --> 35:39.470
I just saw an opportunity
to solve one problem with the other.

35:40.471 --> 35:43.266
When you find the Last Envoy,
real death him on site.

35:44.016 --> 35:46.185
But bring Falconer's stack to me.

35:46.644 --> 35:48.813
We'll deal with this weapon together.

36:02.285 --> 36:05.204
Not quite a meditation temple,
is it? More of a hut.

36:06.289 --> 36:09.500
This is a bad idea.
We should go back.

36:10.418 --> 36:13.629
Nonsense.
Where's your spirit of adventure?

36:20.052 --> 36:21.804
Look, that must be him.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.182
Poe, this is private.
We can't disturb him.

36:31.522 --> 36:34.275
-Mr. Harlan?
-Be careful. You'll set off an alarm.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.194
Why would there be an alarm?

36:38.029 --> 36:39.530
Too late. We better be quick.

36:41.824 --> 36:44.243
-Please, Eddie, you're going too far.

36:44.327 --> 36:47.580
Mr, Harlan,
I apologize for the interruption,

36:47.663 --> 36:50.041
-but I'm in urgent need to speak with you.
-That's enough.

36:50.124 --> 36:51.000
Miss Elizabeth.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.169
I must insist!

36:57.256 --> 36:58.549
What in heaven's name?

37:00.343 --> 37:01.719
He is a fraud.

37:04.263 --> 37:08.059
Just like everything else
in this construct.

37:08.726 --> 37:11.103
-You don't know what you're saying.
-I must be going.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.522
Poe, wait. You can stay here.

37:14.732 --> 37:18.236
Don't you miss feeling useful and whole?

37:18.569 --> 37:20.571
- Yes.
-And human?

37:21.322 --> 37:22.990
Like you do when you're with me?

37:25.326 --> 37:26.577
Oh.

37:27.161 --> 37:30.373
You are not Miss Elizabeth.

37:30.456 --> 37:33.000
I can be, if you let me.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.296
Think of all the pain and misery
you left behind.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.632
The endless deterioration.

37:40.841 --> 37:42.635
Do you really wanna go back to that?

37:44.178 --> 37:46.180
The Miss Elizabeth I knew...

37:47.556 --> 37:49.642
would not run away from pain.

37:51.143 --> 37:52.728
She'd run towards it.

37:57.608 --> 37:58.859
Hey, slow down.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.570
Why? You afraid you'll lose sight of me?

38:01.946 --> 38:04.865
That I'll kill someone else you love?

38:05.199 --> 38:06.701
You wanna fix me, Tak?

38:06.784 --> 38:08.995
Turn me into this woman
you're obsessed with?

38:09.412 --> 38:10.329
You want her.

38:11.664 --> 38:12.790
You're damn right.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.626
The Quell I know
would never put us in this situation.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.962
She would never sabotage our only chance.

38:18.045 --> 38:19.839
-She's gone!
-You don't know that.

38:19.922 --> 38:21.757
You're so blinded by your delusion
of who I was,

38:21.841 --> 38:23.801
you can't see who's here now.

38:23.884 --> 38:25.886
I'm the woman who killed your friend!

38:25.970 --> 38:28.848
I don't know why,
but I remember how it felt.

38:29.181 --> 38:30.016
Good.

38:30.391 --> 38:31.309
Justified.

38:31.726 --> 38:33.436
He deserved to die.

38:33.519 --> 38:34.437
They all did!

38:38.441 --> 38:39.317
There it is.

38:40.276 --> 38:42.945
You finally see me.

38:50.244 --> 38:51.787
There's something in me.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.335
I can't stop it.

39:00.796 --> 39:02.006
No!

39:10.890 --> 39:13.434
I wasn't dreaming. It's real.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.784
Let me out!

39:33.537 --> 39:34.497
Quell!

39:45.591 --> 39:47.176
You either shoot me or help me.

39:51.430 --> 39:52.640
There's another way out.

39:53.516 --> 39:55.059
It may lead to the surface.

40:09.323 --> 40:10.408
Stronghold.

40:11.117 --> 40:12.410
We were underneath it.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.497
Over here.

40:24.380 --> 40:25.423
She fainted.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.388
I don't know if it's p-frag.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.766
-Hey!
-She give you this?

40:41.439 --> 40:42.898
We understand each other now?

40:45.276 --> 40:48.446
Stay here and keep an eye on her.
I'll get a signal to Kemp.

41:10.050 --> 41:11.343
Leaving so soon?

41:14.096 --> 41:16.432
Oh, surely not, you just got here.

41:19.351 --> 41:22.438
Yes, and as I'm sure your spy
will tell you,

41:22.521 --> 41:23.939
I have discovered your ruse.

41:24.356 --> 41:27.026
He went into Konrad's chamber
and made quite a mess of things.

41:27.109 --> 41:29.236
Konrad Harlan isn't in this construct.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.697
And you, sir, are perpetuating a lie.

41:32.364 --> 41:34.492
Oh, I knew you were gonna be trouble.

41:34.992 --> 41:37.161
Out of the blue, an AI decides to profess.

41:37.244 --> 41:40.164
-What have you done with Mr. Harlan?
- We've done him no harm.

41:40.789 --> 41:43.125
We're just paid to keep the lie going.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.085
How very material of you.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.129
I have to keep the servers
running somehow.

41:47.213 --> 41:50.591
It's no use trying to escape.
We have full control over the construct.

41:51.008 --> 41:53.052
Not even an AI can break it.

41:55.054 --> 41:55.888
Very well.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.183
I will stay if I must.

42:01.852 --> 42:02.686
But...

42:05.773 --> 42:07.149
you should know something.

42:07.942 --> 42:10.194
I suffer from a terminal affliction.

42:10.861 --> 42:14.198
A glitch in my system.
It stems from my very core.

42:15.032 --> 42:18.035
I may not be able to control
the construct, but...

42:19.787 --> 42:20.955
I can destroy it.

42:25.751 --> 42:26.669
No!

42:27.169 --> 42:28.546
- No!

43:02.496 --> 43:03.998
Look at that.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.016
Ah! Yes.

43:23.684 --> 43:24.810
Oh, my.

43:26.228 --> 43:27.396
Miss Dig?

43:29.231 --> 43:30.566
No, no, no.

43:35.237 --> 43:36.697
Miss Dig, what happened?
Who did this?

43:36.780 --> 43:39.992
Poe, we have to warn Kovacs!

43:40.075 --> 43:41.785
Warn him? Warn him of what?

44:09.355 --> 44:12.149
Move slow.
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

44:15.944 --> 44:17.529
Use terrain to your advantage.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.991
Seek higher ground.
Incoming threats visible.

44:21.075 --> 44:22.242
Multiple escape routes.

44:23.827 --> 44:26.914
CTAC Wilderness Combat Course, week six.

44:28.457 --> 44:29.416
Do I know you?

44:36.548 --> 44:38.842
Are you so far gone
you don't recognize yourself?

44:48.143 --> 44:49.561
Where'd you get that sleeve?

44:53.399 --> 44:55.984
I know I was a good-looking guy,
but cloning me...

44:57.486 --> 44:58.654
that's a waste of money.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.492
Maybe because this sleeve
is the last time you were worth a damn.

45:06.328 --> 45:07.538
Jaeger spin you up?

45:08.914 --> 45:10.666
Double sleeving is illegal.

45:16.130 --> 45:18.048
It's not double sleeving
if one of us dies.

45:41.947 --> 45:43.532
Careful. What you know, I know.

46:23.822 --> 46:25.949
CTAC training only goes so far.

46:26.533 --> 46:27.534
I've had better.

46:28.786 --> 46:30.412
You don't know my limits.

46:41.215 --> 46:42.466
Say hello to our sister.
