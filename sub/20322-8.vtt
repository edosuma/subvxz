00:12.834 --> 00:14.010
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, are we late?

00:14.040 --> 00:14.921
Oh, no, no.

00:14.951 --> 00:16.576
- Leave your shoes on.
- What did we miss?

00:16.606 --> 00:18.749
- (Greetings)
- You just missed the intros. No big deal.

00:18.779 --> 00:20.473
Ty just started cooking, guys.

00:20.503 --> 00:22.611
Marcel's gonna knock it out
of the park tonight, I know it!

00:22.641 --> 00:25.948
- No way, Mr. Oz. Raven all the way.
- Raven?!

00:25.978 --> 00:27.876
Ha-ha. You know what?
Gabriella is my favourite,

00:27.906 --> 00:29.919
although I do think she's starting
to crack under the pressure.

00:29.949 --> 00:30.586
- All love it.
- Right?

00:30.616 --> 00:32.442
- Yeah.
- Now you too, huh? Come on.

00:32.473 --> 00:35.119
- OK, it's on!
- Everyone shut up, shut up!

00:35.149 --> 00:37.962
<i>Welcome back, everyone, to
the nail-biting, live to air</i>

00:37.992 --> 00:40.429
<i>semi-finals of Five Star Chef.</i>

00:40.459 --> 00:43.107
<i>Each of our contestants
was informed earlier today</i>

00:43.137 --> 00:46.264
<i>that black truffle would be the
surprise semi-final ingredient,</i>

00:46.294 --> 00:49.671
<i>and now they are battling
to complete their unique dish</i>

00:49.701 --> 00:52.190
<i>on time. Gabriella Zimmer!</i>

00:52.220 --> 00:54.540
<i>(Cheers and applause)</i>

00:54.570 --> 00:57.932
<i>- Raven Masters!
- (Cheers and applause)</i>

00:57.962 --> 01:01.920
<i>- And Marcel Beaumont.
- (Cheers and applause)</i>

01:01.950 --> 01:04.169
<i>While they work away, let's
check in with our head judge,</i>

01:04.199 --> 01:07.104
<i>- Gustov Main.
- Just get on with it, Desmond.</i>

01:07.134 --> 01:10.943
<i>All right. And joining him today, we
have two very special guest judges.</i>

01:10.973 --> 01:13.590
<i>From Masterchef Canada: Claudio Aprile!</i>

01:13.620 --> 01:14.526
<i>It's great to be here tonight.</i>

01:14.556 --> 01:17.549
<i>- And of course, Alvin Leung.
- Very exciting.</i>

01:17.579 --> 01:19.128
Ooh, I love Alvin Leung.

01:19.158 --> 01:19.930
- I love him.
- Mm-mm

01:19.960 --> 01:21.391
Tough love all the way,
that's what they need.

01:21.421 --> 01:24.060
<i>All right, gentlemen, what do you
think of our three semi-finalists?</i>

01:24.090 --> 01:25.409
<i>Where's your money tonight, Claudio?</i>

01:25.439 --> 01:28.307
<i>Do you think Gabriella
can make a comeback?</i>

01:28.337 --> 01:30.292
Raven is the true artist here.

01:30.322 --> 01:32.723
<i>Raven, OK, all right. Alvin?</i>

01:32.757 --> 01:34.939
<i>- Marcel. He's hard to beat.
- All right.</i>

01:34.969 --> 01:36.230
Do you agree with that, Gustov?

01:36.260 --> 01:39.400
<i>Look, only two contestants can
make it to the finals tonight.</i>

01:39.430 --> 01:42.098
<i>It isn't about winners,
it's about losers.</i>

01:42.133 --> 01:44.000
<i>Too hot in the kitchen? Get out.</i>

01:44.030 --> 01:46.469
<i>The kitchen takes no prisoners,
as I like to say, Alvin.</i>

01:46.499 --> 01:48.941
- No pressure on Marcel, huh?
- What?

01:48.971 --> 01:51.112
He can take it. He's a culinary god.

01:51.142 --> 01:53.414
<i>All right, Marcel, what do
you have planned for tonight?</i>

01:53.444 --> 01:55.169
<i>Black truffle, that should
be right up your alley.</i>

01:55.199 --> 01:57.784
<i>I'm preparing truffle-infused
braised tenderloin</i>

01:57.814 --> 02:01.421
<i>- with savoury black truffle meringue.
- Hmm, sounds amazing.</i>

02:01.451 --> 02:04.325
<i>Raven and Gabriella are gonna
have a tough time topping that one.</i>

02:04.355 --> 02:05.810
<i>No chance. Can't be done.</i>

02:05.840 --> 02:07.390
<i>Well, we have our judges'
take on things.</i>

02:07.420 --> 02:09.496
<i>Let's check in with our
other contestants.</i>

02:09.526 --> 02:11.877
<i>Of course, we have Gabriella
over here...</i>

02:11.907 --> 02:13.910
<i>- What?
- (Groaning)</i>

02:13.940 --> 02:16.253
<i>Marcel! Are you OK?</i>

02:16.283 --> 02:17.820
<i>Marcel! Marcel!</i>

02:17.850 --> 02:19.608
- What happened to Marcel?
- He just collapsed.

02:19.638 --> 02:20.421
<i>- See that?
- Um...</i>

02:20.451 --> 02:22.444
<i>- Call 911!
- Um...</i>

02:22.474 --> 02:23.386
<i>Give him some air!</i>

02:23.416 --> 02:26.891
<i>We're gonna take a break and we'll
be right back after this commercial.</i>

02:26.926 --> 02:28.466
<i>All right.</i>

02:28.973 --> 02:30.740
- What?
- Come on, that's gotta be

02:30.770 --> 02:31.650
a publicity stunt, right?

02:31.680 --> 02:33.494
People are tweeting about
it. They're freaking out.

02:33.524 --> 02:34.961
There's a medic on set.

02:34.991 --> 02:37.849
Hopefully the medic can
stabilize him in time for EMS.

02:37.879 --> 02:40.448
- Oh, geez.
- What? What is it?

02:40.478 --> 02:44.274
Someone just tweeted from the
audience. I think Marcel's dead.

02:44.304 --> 02:45.591
What?

02:49.023 --> 02:54.667
Sync & Corrections by Wolfen www.addic7ed.com

03:02.718 --> 03:04.311
<i>Did you see that show
Five Star, last night?</i>

03:04.341 --> 03:05.624
- Yeah, yeah.
- There's buzz all over.

03:05.654 --> 03:08.917
- That guy Marcel was poisoned.
- Yes, I heard it on the way in.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.925
Has anyone reached out to
the coroner's office yet?

03:10.955 --> 03:13.888
Yeah, they said they need to wait
to analyze the stomach contents.

03:13.918 --> 03:16.665
- Do you think the rumours could be true?
- I think rumours are just rumours.

03:16.695 --> 03:19.047
Until the coroner comes out
with something definitive,

03:19.077 --> 03:20.793
we need to treat this
like a suspicious death.

03:20.823 --> 03:23.393
Turns out the deceased
has family in high places.

03:23.423 --> 03:24.908
Yeah, Senator Peter Beaumont.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.255
- Marcel was his nephew.
- OK, so I'm guessing

03:27.322 --> 03:29.298
the Senator made a few
phone calls upstairs and...

03:29.328 --> 03:32.022
We can't be caught
flat-footed on this one.

03:32.052 --> 03:35.104
If it turns out that Marcel really
was poisoned, we need evidence

03:35.134 --> 03:37.386
already gathered, witnesses
already interviewed,

03:37.416 --> 03:39.356
and possible motives across the board.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.569
- Alex is already on the scene.
- We'll head over now.

03:41.599 --> 03:44.844
- I'll start gathering background.
- Great, thank you.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.456
Do you really think

03:46.486 --> 03:48.358
that someone would murder
someone on live television?

03:48.388 --> 03:50.728
Gives a whole new level to reality TV.

03:50.795 --> 03:53.531
â™ª â™ª

03:59.473 --> 04:02.322
I understand this is an
inconvenience for you, Mr. Werther.

04:02.390 --> 04:04.918
Everything must be returned in
its original, pristine condition.

04:04.948 --> 04:07.789
- This kitchen runs on precision.
- OK, we will do our best.

04:07.819 --> 04:10.363
- You will?
- Yes, but this is still

04:10.398 --> 04:12.274
a police investigation.

04:12.447 --> 04:14.366
If you'll just excuse me for a minute?

04:14.501 --> 04:16.498
- OK.
- Thank you.

04:19.015 --> 04:21.531
Jessie Werther, the
show's culinary manager.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.136
He's in charge of
everything in the kitchen,

04:23.166 --> 04:25.172
and "control freak" doesn't cover it.

04:25.202 --> 04:27.888
- OK, so what do we have?
- I'm taking the food

04:27.918 --> 04:29.738
and equipment back to
the lab and testing it

04:29.768 --> 04:32.838
for toxic substances, see what
I can find ahead of the report.

04:32.868 --> 04:35.174
You know, maybe we should grab
the footage from last night's show.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.842
Maybe there's some shots they didn't air.

04:36.872 --> 04:39.182
Already on it. I'm
going to use it to track

04:39.212 --> 04:40.974
everything that Marcel touched or ate.

04:41.004 --> 04:43.932
- What about the contestants?
- Everyone including the judges

04:43.962 --> 04:46.201
gave statements to uniforms
last night and were sent home.

04:46.231 --> 04:48.403
OK, well, we'll set up
interviews with anyone

04:48.433 --> 04:50.159
who had contact with Marcel

04:50.189 --> 04:53.563
or access to the kitchen.
Do we have anyone else?

04:53.593 --> 04:55.198
Gustov, the head judge, is supposed to be

04:55.228 --> 04:57.534
around here somewhere, and

04:57.564 --> 04:59.529
over there, you will
find Desmond Mansfield

04:59.530 --> 05:01.780
speaking to yet again another reporter.

05:01.810 --> 05:03.416
I haven't been able to
get a word in naturals...

05:03.446 --> 05:04.603
<i>Excuse me!</i>

05:05.050 --> 05:07.440
Each item must be individually
wrapped to avoid damage.

05:07.470 --> 05:09.276
Culinary equipment can only work

05:09.306 --> 05:10.850
<i>at its best if flawless.</i>

05:10.880 --> 05:13.029
Did I mention that guy's a bit OCD?

05:13.030 --> 05:15.280
- Thanks, Alex.
- Yeah, no problem.

05:15.350 --> 05:17.089
So, Five Star Chef fan,

05:17.090 --> 05:18.509
what do you know about Desmond Mansfield?

05:18.510 --> 05:19.769
Well, he's not just the host,

05:19.770 --> 05:21.609
he's also the creator and producer,

05:21.610 --> 05:23.809
and also an accomplished
chef in his own right.

05:23.810 --> 05:26.954
Marcel Beaumont died
doing what he loved to do.

05:27.350 --> 05:29.529
The world was robbed of a great talent.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.619
Mr. Mansfield? We're IIB.

05:31.620 --> 05:33.479
We'd like to ask you a few
questions, if that's OK.

05:33.480 --> 05:37.549
Of course, but I have to admit,
these rumours of poisoning...

05:37.550 --> 05:39.019
I find them pretty hard to believe.

05:39.020 --> 05:41.739
Surely Marcel's death was
just a terrible tragedy.

05:41.740 --> 05:44.299
Well, we're still just
gathering facts at this point.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.450
All I know is what you
must have seen on TV:

05:46.480 --> 05:47.719
Marcel was fine one moment,

05:47.749 --> 05:49.500
and then he just... Collapsed.

05:49.530 --> 05:52.420
<i>Huge relief. Just glad it's over.</i>

05:52.450 --> 05:54.400
How was your relationship with him?

05:54.430 --> 05:55.581
Can't say I knew him that well.

05:55.611 --> 05:58.969
Some contestants you... connect
with quicker than others.

05:59.219 --> 06:01.560
<i>Backstabbing bloodsucker.</i>

06:01.590 --> 06:02.960
There were no personal issues?

06:02.990 --> 06:05.710
Every season has its prima
donna, but it's nothing new.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.000
Mr. Mansfield, the network's
on the line for you.

06:08.030 --> 06:11.189
I really need to take this.
The live finale is tonight

06:11.190 --> 06:13.469
and I have an extremely
concerned broadcaster on my hands.

06:13.470 --> 06:15.279
You're going through
with the finale tonight?

06:15.280 --> 06:16.889
Marcel's death was horrible,

06:16.890 --> 06:19.379
but I see no reason why
Raven and Gabriella's dreams

06:19.380 --> 06:20.796
have to die with him.

06:20.826 --> 06:23.790
Ratings through the
roof. Huge for my career.

06:23.820 --> 06:26.259
Do you know where we can
find the judge, Gustov Main?

06:26.260 --> 06:28.090
In his dressing room, probably.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.280
Oh, but I have to warn you, he
took Marcel's death pretty hard.

06:31.310 --> 06:33.912
You might find him a
little... Less than sober.

06:38.151 --> 06:40.079
Gustov took Marcel's death pretty hard.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.240
I couldn't say the same
thing for Desmond, though.

06:42.270 --> 06:44.280
He thought he was a backstabber
and he was glad it was over.

06:44.310 --> 06:46.829
So Desmond may have had something
to do with Marcel's death?

06:46.830 --> 06:49.220
Yeah. But he's pretty
happy with the ratings.

06:49.250 --> 06:52.560
Gustov Main... Let's see
what less than sober means.

06:53.820 --> 06:55.090
<i>Enter!</i>

07:02.578 --> 07:05.630
Do you know I specifically
asked not to be disturbed?

07:05.660 --> 07:07.980
We're with the IIB, Mr. Main.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.430
We'd like to ask you a
few questions if that's OK.

07:10.460 --> 07:13.677
Oh, police. How unappetizing.

07:15.238 --> 07:18.550
Excuse... My current state.

07:18.740 --> 07:20.999
Ghastly business, watching a man die.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.780
I understand this must
be very difficult for you.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.429
When I say the kitchen takes no prisoners,

07:24.430 --> 07:26.230
I don't mean it literally.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.569
You don't suspect foul play, do you?

07:28.570 --> 07:30.360
Right now we're just collecting statements

07:30.390 --> 07:32.100
and gathering evidence.

07:32.370 --> 07:35.060
We heard there was some bad
blood between Marcel and Desmond.

07:35.090 --> 07:36.119
You know anything about that?

07:36.120 --> 07:37.770
Of that I have no idea.

07:38.310 --> 07:42.150
I loathe Desmond, almost as
much as I loathe brutality.

07:43.019 --> 07:44.869
We communicate as little as possible.

07:44.870 --> 07:46.599
What about Raven or Gabriella?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.149
Do you think either of them had
any reason to want Marcel dead?

07:49.150 --> 07:50.899
I wouldn't wish to speculate.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.569
<i>Only Raven can win now.</i>

07:53.570 --> 07:56.039
Some people believe that
Raven's the new front-runner.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.100
Do you think she felt
threatened by Marcel,

07:58.130 --> 07:59.809
that maybe she couldn't beat him?

07:59.810 --> 08:00.900
<i>Raven is a great artist,</i>

08:00.930 --> 08:03.070
but hasn't the drive to
want something so badly.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.630
Marcel, now, he was the one
with the real killer instinct.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.500
I truly mourn his death.

08:09.850 --> 08:12.810
<i>Terrible thing. Shocking.</i>

08:14.360 --> 08:17.600
Only food can heal such wounds.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.968
Ah (throat clearing).

08:22.180 --> 08:24.859
- I shouldn't. I'm on duty, I...
- Eat.

08:24.860 --> 08:28.262
Or I will invoke my right to
remain silent now and forever.

08:39.775 --> 08:40.999
That is amazing.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.104
High praise from an officer of the law.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.530
It's a little dish I
picked up in Thailand.

08:45.540 --> 08:46.870
Can I get the recipe?

08:49.190 --> 08:51.274
No, that's fine. It's really good, though.

08:51.363 --> 08:52.591
Thanks.

08:57.940 --> 09:00.690
- Hey, Oz.
- Hey, Tia.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.349
So, according to the internet,
apparently Raven is now

09:03.350 --> 09:05.769
the hands-on favourite
to win this whole thing.

09:05.770 --> 09:07.630
Looks like Adam was right.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.720
What? You're not telling me something.

09:12.770 --> 09:14.609
What? What aren't you telling me? Tell me!

09:14.610 --> 09:16.989
- It's no biggie.
- What's no biggie?

09:16.990 --> 09:20.819
Well, I just... I was
talking to Sandy last night...

09:20.820 --> 09:23.900
Sandy? You still talk to Sandy?

09:23.940 --> 09:26.309
Yeah. Just because you guys
broke up doesn't mean we have to.

09:26.310 --> 09:27.729
I called her to talk about the show

09:27.730 --> 09:29.730
and, you know, what happened, and

09:29.970 --> 09:33.251
we started reminiscing about how
we all used to watch together...

09:33.281 --> 09:35.240
- Uh-huh?
- And...

09:35.270 --> 09:38.119
she said she's been meaning
to call you about something,

09:38.120 --> 09:40.080
that the two of you need to talk.

09:40.210 --> 09:42.169
Need to talk? Talk about what?

09:42.170 --> 09:43.889
Like talk talk? About us?

09:43.890 --> 09:46.029
Is that... Does she want
to get back together?

09:46.030 --> 09:46.974
- Did you get everything?
- I didn't...

09:47.004 --> 09:48.999
- Is that what she wants?
- I have no idea, to any of the above,

09:49.000 --> 09:50.522
and I really have to go, but

09:50.552 --> 09:52.730
- just give her a call.
- What?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.857
And try not to drive
yourself crazy about it.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.709
Too late.

10:03.740 --> 10:07.019
- Hey, Alex.
- Hey. Uh, coroner's report is in.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.219
- OK.
- Michelle, Marcel Beaumont died

10:09.220 --> 10:11.969
of an atypical reaction to an allergen

10:11.970 --> 10:13.739
and we found small
amounts of peanut protein

10:13.740 --> 10:14.799
in his stomach contents.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.039
So Marcel died of a peanut allergy?

10:17.040 --> 10:17.840
Most definitely.

10:17.870 --> 10:19.479
You figure the coroner
would have noticed that.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.870
That's where the atypical part comes in.

10:21.900 --> 10:25.330
Usually, an allergen causes
hives first, systemic swelling,

10:25.360 --> 10:27.489
a closed trachea, and
then finally asphyxiation.

10:27.490 --> 10:29.969
But if the person has an
underlying cardiac condition,

10:29.970 --> 10:33.260
the passages to the heart can
swell closed almost instantly.

10:34.540 --> 10:37.590
See how Marcel grabs his
chest before the counter?

10:37.710 --> 10:40.449
Right. His coronary artery just closed up.

10:40.450 --> 10:42.639
Death occurred before any
typical allergy symptoms

10:42.640 --> 10:44.909
- had a chance to appear.
- So his death was an accident.

10:44.910 --> 10:48.030
One of his ingredients contained
a peanut product by mistake?

10:48.060 --> 10:51.259
Even if he was careful,
a poorly cleaned bowl

10:51.260 --> 10:53.099
could end up with some
peanut residue on it.

10:53.100 --> 10:56.459
Those would all be my conclusions
under normal circumstances,

10:56.460 --> 10:58.729
that Marcel's death was a consequence

10:58.730 --> 11:00.760
of a simple but tragic mistake.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.020
- But?
- But I spent the whole morning

11:04.050 --> 11:05.427
with Jessie Werther and

11:05.450 --> 11:08.925
he is the man that stocks and
cleans the set kitchen and...

11:08.955 --> 11:12.616
I don't think that Jessie
Werther makes mistakes, really.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.276
Ever.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.509
There's absolutely no way,

11:15.510 --> 11:17.719
under any circumstances,
that a dirty dish, spoon,

11:17.720 --> 11:20.990
pot or pan has ever
appeared in my kitchen. Ever.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.330
- Even if it was highly unlikely...
- Impossible.

11:25.790 --> 11:27.859
What about the hundreds of
ingredients in that kitchen?

11:27.889 --> 11:29.148
Maybe one of them contained

11:29.178 --> 11:30.569
- a peanut product.
- Firstly,

11:30.570 --> 11:31.809
people with severe food allergies

11:31.810 --> 11:33.829
aren't allowed on the
show. You can ask Desmond.

11:33.830 --> 11:35.459
- OK, we will.
- And secondly,

11:35.460 --> 11:37.009
contestants don't share ingredients.

11:37.010 --> 11:38.919
Each station is stocked
with products selected

11:38.920 --> 11:40.149
by that contestant personally,

11:40.150 --> 11:42.229
and at Marcel's station
there were no products

11:42.230 --> 11:43.932
with peanut products listed on the labels.

11:43.962 --> 11:45.280
How could you possibly know that?

11:45.310 --> 11:46.459
I scan them once, I know.

11:46.460 --> 11:49.590
Now, I must insist that
everything your officers confiscate

11:49.600 --> 11:52.270
be returned in pristine
condition for the finale.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.350
I'm afraid that that's just not possible.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.820
We'll supply a list of everything
we take, so that you can replace it.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.979
- And why would I need a list?
- There's hundreds of items.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.920
An officer with short brown hair,

12:02.950 --> 12:06.029
mole on his upper right
lip, badge number 3478901,

12:06.030 --> 12:08.960
confiscated a set of four
stainless steel nesting bowls,

12:08.990 --> 12:10.200
three acrylic cutting boards,

12:10.230 --> 12:12.249
three immersion blenders, two mandolins,

12:12.250 --> 12:14.490
a Japanese knife set consisting
of a two-inch paring knife,

12:14.520 --> 12:16.239
four-inch filleting
blade, seven-inch cleaver

12:16.240 --> 12:18.184
- as well as six stainless...
- OK, I think we're beginning

12:18.214 --> 12:19.460
to understand.

12:21.090 --> 12:22.589
You got a photographic memory?

12:22.590 --> 12:24.578
The correct term is eidetic recall.

12:24.608 --> 12:26.369
Oh, y... you know, a memory like that

12:26.370 --> 12:28.809
would be very useful to our investigation.

12:28.810 --> 12:30.449
If you're suggesting I
remember seeing anyone

12:30.450 --> 12:33.449
contaminating Marcel's
food, you're mistaken.

12:33.450 --> 12:35.760
We're suggesting that you
might have seen something

12:35.770 --> 12:38.680
that maybe you don't even
realize is significant.

12:38.690 --> 12:40.750
Do you remember seeing anything unusual

12:40.760 --> 12:43.379
- in the past few days?
- Of course.

12:43.380 --> 12:45.180
One sees unusual things every day.

12:45.270 --> 12:46.640
Lately, there's been a few.

13:05.803 --> 13:06.803
Toby?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.950
- Are you sure you're OK?
- Yeah, yeah. His, uh,

13:18.980 --> 13:22.230
memory capacity is much
bigger and quicker than mine.

13:22.580 --> 13:26.829
Reading him was like being
inside of a rapid-fire slide show.

13:26.830 --> 13:28.510
So this guy, um

13:28.540 --> 13:31.169
he really remembers everything,
like everything everything?

13:31.170 --> 13:32.459
People born with eidetic

13:32.460 --> 13:35.408
recall remember each moment of
their lives as clearly as any other.

13:35.438 --> 13:37.246
They remember what day of the week

13:37.276 --> 13:38.579
they met someone ten years ago.

13:38.580 --> 13:39.919
They remember what they were wearing

13:39.920 --> 13:41.599
the last Wednesday of each month.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.839
He's also incredibly detail-oriented.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.599
Eidetics tend to be perfectionists.

13:45.600 --> 13:46.769
The two trades go hand in hand.

13:46.770 --> 13:49.499
That's means if Jessie says
that there is zero chance

13:49.500 --> 13:51.199
that Marcel ingested peanut residue

13:51.200 --> 13:52.720
in his kitchen accidentally, then...

13:52.750 --> 13:55.979
Then it's safe to assume that
the exposure was intentional.

13:55.980 --> 13:59.551
Someone knew about his allergy
and used it to poison him.

13:59.930 --> 14:01.789
When you read Jessie, did
you get anything useful?

14:01.790 --> 14:03.839
Any indication who might've
done something like that?

14:03.840 --> 14:05.999
I asked him if he had
seen anything unusual

14:06.000 --> 14:08.150
in the past few days, and that's when, uh,

14:08.840 --> 14:10.820
I got more than I could handle.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.240
I saw a...

14:13.600 --> 14:16.800
car with a lot of parking tickets on it,

14:17.080 --> 14:19.689
A bent spoon... This might be small stuff,

14:19.690 --> 14:22.679
I don't know, but just
came at me so quick.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.249
Just 'cause Jessie's got a perfect memory

14:24.250 --> 14:25.950
doesn't mean that Toby does.

14:25.980 --> 14:28.479
An eidetic mind would
theoretically upload with

14:28.480 --> 14:29.969
blazing transfer speeds.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.410
I also saw Marcel confronting Desmond.

14:32.600 --> 14:35.730
Marcel had a book with
Desmond's photo on it maybe.

14:35.950 --> 14:37.223
Like this?

14:38.280 --> 14:39.279
<i>Yeah, that's it!</i>

14:39.280 --> 14:42.140
Desmond's new book. I hear it's amazing.

14:42.150 --> 14:44.419
Sales certainly are. He's
making a ton of money.

14:44.420 --> 14:46.419
There's nothing controversial I could see

14:46.420 --> 14:47.910
when I looked into it, but

14:47.930 --> 14:49.179
there was something interesting I found

14:49.180 --> 14:51.330
when I tried to vet Desmond's CV.

14:52.595 --> 14:56.139
Desmond is a very
successful restaurateur now,

14:56.140 --> 14:58.719
but all of these places he
cooked in early in his career

14:58.720 --> 15:00.567
were hot spots on the other
side of the world that opened

15:00.597 --> 15:01.979
and closed within months.

15:01.980 --> 15:03.579
It's almost impossible to confirm

15:03.580 --> 15:04.820
that he actually worked at any of them.

15:04.850 --> 15:06.829
So you think Desmond fudged his CV,

15:06.830 --> 15:09.669
that he's not quite the Five Star Chef
he's letting on to be?

15:09.670 --> 15:12.239
If there's a connection between
Marcel and the cookbook...

15:12.240 --> 15:14.860
Did Desmond know about Marcel's allergy?

15:14.930 --> 15:16.519
Jessie said people with food allergies

15:16.520 --> 15:18.089
weren't allowed on the show.

15:18.090 --> 15:19.829
We'll take a crack at
this Desmond Mansfield,

15:19.830 --> 15:21.669
rattle his cage, see what comes out.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.590
Meanwhile, the other two
contestants are down in holding,

15:23.620 --> 15:26.351
I want you to take care
of them, and get Alex

15:26.381 --> 15:28.339
to find out how on earth Marcel ends up

15:28.340 --> 15:29.859
with peanut residue in his system.

15:29.860 --> 15:31.420
- I'll let her know.
- Thanks.

15:31.450 --> 15:34.830
You know, I think Raven had the
most to gain from Marcel's death.

15:35.254 --> 15:37.319
Maybe she couldn't take
the heat so she decided

15:37.320 --> 15:39.819
to kick the front-runner
out of the kitchen.

15:47.672 --> 15:49.259
Sorry to keep you waiting, miss Masters.

15:49.260 --> 15:50.569
This shouldn't take long,

15:50.570 --> 15:52.239
we just have a couple
of questions for you.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.390
Anything to help.

15:53.660 --> 15:57.029
But do you really think someone
killed Marcel on purpose?

15:57.030 --> 15:59.099
It's beginning to look that way, yes.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.870
Who would do something like that?

16:00.900 --> 16:01.909
That's why we believe that

16:01.910 --> 16:03.719
you have the most to gain from his death,

16:03.720 --> 16:05.159
now that you're front-runner.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.400
You haven't had a whole lot
of success before the show,

16:07.410 --> 16:09.799
Right? This is your big break.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.370
I try not to think about those things.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.080
Honestly, all I care about is

16:15.160 --> 16:16.660
the dish in front of me...

16:16.680 --> 16:18.630
Making it the best it can be.

16:18.720 --> 16:22.109
Cooking is an art. You
can't think about winning.

16:22.110 --> 16:25.290
Yes, but it's also a competition.
That's gotta mean something.

16:25.840 --> 16:29.970
Winning means a new life.
Marcel didn't play fair.

16:30.220 --> 16:33.900
We've heard that Marcel
wasn't the nicest competitor.

16:33.970 --> 16:36.010
Did you have any issues
with him personally?

16:36.706 --> 16:38.969
Personally? No.

16:38.970 --> 16:42.230
<i>Horrible guy. Crushed her heart.</i>

16:42.260 --> 16:44.490
How about anyone else on the show?

16:44.744 --> 16:48.625
There were tensions sometimes
between all of the competitors.

16:53.150 --> 16:55.310
- OK.
- Thank you for your time.

17:00.390 --> 17:02.309
She wants to win a lot
more than she's letting on,

17:02.310 --> 17:05.099
and I don't think she
liked Marcel, to be honest.

17:05.477 --> 17:08.539
I got something I think I saw
in Jessie's head as well...

17:08.540 --> 17:10.579
Gabriella slapping Marcel.

17:10.579 --> 17:12.329
Let's bring Gabriella in.

17:14.215 --> 17:15.409
Hey! Thanks for coming in.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.079
Ah, you must be the inspector.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.098
Yeah, Brian Becker.
Listen, sorry about this,

17:19.099 --> 17:21.670
but when a cop's gotta eat,
a cop's gotta eat, right?

17:22.619 --> 17:24.368
- Fry?
- Uh, no. Thank you.

17:24.369 --> 17:25.348
- You sure about that?
- Thank you.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.907
- OK.
- Look, I've already talked

17:26.938 --> 17:28.830
to two other officers today and...

17:28.880 --> 17:31.300
You can imagine things are a
bit crazy back at the studio.

17:31.330 --> 17:32.640
Yeah, I bet. Listen,

17:33.890 --> 17:36.190
Just tell me what Marcel
knew about this book.

17:36.960 --> 17:37.949
We'll call it a day.

17:37.950 --> 17:39.784
I have no idea what you mean.

17:39.814 --> 17:41.013
Hm...

17:41.102 --> 17:43.049
'Cause see, I think it's in
your interest to level with me,

17:43.050 --> 17:44.469
'cause we had a little look at your CV

17:44.470 --> 17:46.739
and it's full of what
you might call filler.

17:46.740 --> 17:48.779
I believe that would be
your word against mine.

17:48.780 --> 17:50.050
Yeah, maybe.

17:50.620 --> 17:53.810
But, you know, a couple
of well-placed tweets

17:53.930 --> 17:56.880
claiming falsified
credentials, sponsors walk away,

17:56.980 --> 17:59.779
ratings nosedive, someone finds
himself Working the fry station.

17:59.780 --> 18:00.849
- Are you sure you don't want one of these?
- OK, OK.

18:00.850 --> 18:03.680
- 'Cause they're fantastic.
- No. OK, OK.

18:04.990 --> 18:08.670
Marcel went digging. He got
to one of my old assistants,

18:08.680 --> 18:11.460
who claimed to have created
all the recipes in the book.

18:11.670 --> 18:14.320
- Any truth to that?
- Everyone uses assistants.

18:14.330 --> 18:18.450
It's standard practice.
But if word got out...

18:19.600 --> 18:21.580
the man was threatening my brand.

18:22.210 --> 18:23.170
That so.

18:23.990 --> 18:26.440
- So what did he want?
- A guaranteed win.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.290
I told him that voting
had very strict criteria,

18:29.320 --> 18:32.960
and even if I wanted to, there's no
way I could fudge with the results

18:32.990 --> 18:34.919
with so many hard-core fans watching.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.339
So... maybe you just thought

18:37.340 --> 18:39.440
it was less risky to
fake his accidental death.

18:39.470 --> 18:41.929
Peanut allergy... perfect
murder weapon, right?

18:41.930 --> 18:43.459
- Peanut allergy?
- Yeah.

18:43.460 --> 18:44.760
Is that what killed him?

18:45.250 --> 18:46.729
Look, I had no idea.

18:46.730 --> 18:47.760
You sure about that?

18:47.770 --> 18:50.660
We make all the contestants
fill out an insurance form.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.180
I'll have 'em sent over.

18:52.410 --> 18:55.640
There's no way the box beside
"Peanut allergy" is checked off.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.629
If Marcel had a peanut
allergy, he lied about it.

18:58.630 --> 19:00.810
Kept him to himself to get on the show.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.689
- Sorry if I seem... um, upset...
- There you go.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.590
Thank you. It's just been a...

19:11.410 --> 19:13.000
hard couple of weeks.

19:13.270 --> 19:14.500
I understand.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.439
We just have a couple of

19:15.469 --> 19:17.557
- questions for you.
- OK.

19:17.970 --> 19:20.619
We understand that you and
Marcel had a public confrontation

19:20.620 --> 19:23.047
in the days leading up to his death?

19:23.077 --> 19:26.459
Um, yeah, it was... it was
nothing serious, though.

19:26.460 --> 19:29.289
It was, you know, the
pressures of the competition.

19:29.290 --> 19:31.310
I apologized afterward.

19:31.450 --> 19:33.610
What was your relationship
like with Marcel?

19:33.620 --> 19:37.130
We understand that a few other
people had issues with him.

19:37.780 --> 19:41.800
Oh, yeah, no, we got along fine. At first.

19:44.404 --> 19:47.379
<i>We shouldn't be doing
this. I can't lose focus.</i>

19:47.380 --> 19:49.937
<i>This is real, Gabriella.</i>

19:52.450 --> 19:54.400
Were the two of you involved?

19:55.790 --> 19:58.540
Is that what the
argument was really about?

19:59.010 --> 20:00.510
It was a fling.

20:01.220 --> 20:04.540
It was meaningless. Neither
one of us took it seriously.

20:05.360 --> 20:08.070
<i>It's over. Go back to
focusing on the show.</i>

20:08.080 --> 20:09.489
<i>You picked me up and dropped me</i>

20:09.490 --> 20:12.348
<i>just to throw me off my game!</i>

20:15.880 --> 20:18.409
Your, uh, performance suffered on the show

20:18.410 --> 20:19.509
over the past few weeks.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.880
Would you blame that on
what happened with Marcel?

20:22.877 --> 20:23.910
No.

20:24.550 --> 20:27.005
I have only myself to blame for that.

20:27.910 --> 20:30.610
Were you aware that Marcel
had a peanut allergy?

20:30.890 --> 20:33.079
No. Absolutely not.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.796
<i>Terrible, terrible accident.</i>

20:37.530 --> 20:39.139
I don't know, she seemed
pretty upset in there.

20:39.140 --> 20:41.437
I thought that she was about to confess.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.979
I think she believes Marcel
used her and toyed with her

20:43.980 --> 20:46.719
to push her out of contention,
you know, break her focus.

20:46.749 --> 20:48.308
Mm-hmm. And it worked.

20:48.338 --> 20:50.989
I mean, she was in the running
until a couple of weeks ago.

20:50.990 --> 20:53.289
Once in a lifetime
opportunity just crushed.

20:53.290 --> 20:55.190
Yeah, but she seemed genuinely convinced

20:55.220 --> 20:56.429
that the death was an accident

20:56.459 --> 20:59.582
- and she didn't know about the allergy.
- (Beep! Beep! Beep!)

21:00.330 --> 21:02.377
- Alex says she has something.
- Mm!

21:10.318 --> 21:15.220
Nnn... I don't... OK.

21:21.010 --> 21:24.039
- Hey! Eh-eh, hey!
- Oz, hey!

21:24.069 --> 21:25.550
- Fancy running into you here.
- Yeah.

21:25.580 --> 21:29.289
Yeah. Wow. Getting a coffee?

21:29.290 --> 21:31.150
- Yeah.
- Yeah... Hey you know,

21:31.160 --> 21:33.380
Tia had mentioned that you, uh...

21:33.680 --> 21:36.120
- You wanted to talk to me about something?
- Yeah, I did.

21:36.150 --> 21:39.090
I just... I thought you would...
I just thought you would call.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.647
No, I was thinking about what it could
have been that you possibly wanted

21:41.677 --> 21:42.969
- to talk to me about and, um...
- Oz...

21:42.970 --> 21:45.229
This is going to be hard for
you, probably, but you know.

21:45.230 --> 21:48.290
I was thinking a lot about...
I mean, I just don't think...

21:48.320 --> 21:49.288
- Oz.
- You know I've been thinking

21:49.318 --> 21:50.370
a lot about, um.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.029
- Hey, there you are.
- Hi.

21:52.030 --> 21:53.273
Sorry I'm late.

21:54.740 --> 21:57.150
Um... Oz, you remember Hunter?

21:57.180 --> 21:59.940
You guys met at Sage and Tyler's wedding.

22:00.250 --> 22:01.940
Oz! Of course.

22:01.970 --> 22:04.970
Nice to see you again.
Sandy says great things.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.430
Y... hi.

22:09.015 --> 22:12.215
Oh this is the thing you
wanted to talk to me about.

22:13.710 --> 22:15.989
- Hunter.
- Yeah. Yeah, I just...

22:15.990 --> 22:18.935
I wanted to tell you myself, um...

22:20.370 --> 22:22.520
Hunter and I are getting married.

22:24.740 --> 22:27.000
A.. Wh... What is it?

22:28.530 --> 22:31.570
Um. I'll... I'm going to give you a call.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.110
- Yeah...
- Nice to see you again.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.959
I isolated the source
of peanut contamination.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.949
There was a small amount
of unfiltered peanut oil

22:52.950 --> 22:54.529
in the dish that Marcel was preparing

22:54.530 --> 22:56.440
just moments before his death.

22:56.470 --> 22:59.400
You can see him taste the mixture... here.

22:59.510 --> 23:01.249
You sure there was
nothing else in his station

23:01.250 --> 23:03.179
that would've had peanut residue on it?

23:03.180 --> 23:05.150
Just these three items tested positive:

23:05.180 --> 23:06.890
the eggs, the whisk and the bowl.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.860
So, first I retrieved the eggshells

23:08.870 --> 23:10.939
to check for evidence
of hypodermic penetration

23:10.940 --> 23:13.760
and there were no holes,
no peanut oil residue.

23:14.020 --> 23:15.349
- Very thorough.
- Yeah.

23:15.350 --> 23:17.919
That ruled out the eggs
which left one of the two

23:17.920 --> 23:20.450
cooking implements as the primary source

23:20.560 --> 23:22.199
and then I found this...

23:25.290 --> 23:28.129
- Am I missing something here?
- Gaining something, actually.

23:28.130 --> 23:30.219
Each of the contestants
were given three whisks

23:30.220 --> 23:31.969
but Marcel's station had four

23:31.970 --> 23:33.356
and the fourth was the largest,

23:33.386 --> 23:35.349
which any seasoned chef would select

23:35.350 --> 23:37.850
- to whip up a fluffy meringue.
- Right.

23:38.540 --> 23:40.989
And in anyone else's kitchen
that wouldn't mean much,

23:40.990 --> 23:42.099
but in Jesse Werther's...

23:42.100 --> 23:44.160
We may have just found our murder weapon.

23:54.454 --> 23:56.742
We have an extra whisk,
peanut oil residue,

23:56.772 --> 24:00.549
three people with motive, but
no one we can actually prove

24:00.579 --> 24:02.839
knew about Marcel's
allergy in the first place.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.100
Alright so we need to figure out
who put the contaminated whisk

24:05.130 --> 24:06.249
at Marcel's station.

24:06.250 --> 24:07.780
I re-checked with all the witnesses.

24:07.810 --> 24:10.849
No one saw anybody headed to the
kitchen set with an extra whisk.

24:10.879 --> 24:12.509
Hm. So where do we go from here?

24:12.510 --> 24:14.269
I think there's only one place to go:

24:14.270 --> 24:17.039
think I've gotta go back
inside Jesse's perfect mind.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.700
<i>Are you sure you want to do that?</i>

24:18.730 --> 24:21.540
Uh, who knows what another
high-speed download

24:21.570 --> 24:22.198
could do to you?

24:22.228 --> 24:23.389
I'll slow him down,

24:23.390 --> 24:25.650
I'll pick my questions
a little more carefully.

24:25.660 --> 24:26.979
I think if there's anyone who knows

24:27.009 --> 24:29.159
how the extra whisk got
into the kitchen, it's Jesse.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.969
You don't have to do
this, you know that, right?

24:31.203 --> 24:33.430
Honestly, I think it's
the best shot we got.

24:36.390 --> 24:38.610
OK. I'll get him back in here.

24:39.820 --> 24:40.820
OK.

24:44.180 --> 24:46.820
She's engaged? She never told me.

24:46.830 --> 24:48.479
Three months after we broke up.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.909
Our relationship is barely in the grave

24:49.910 --> 24:51.820
and she's already stomping all over it.

24:51.860 --> 24:52.639
So how did you leave it?

24:52.640 --> 24:54.640
Are... are you still friendly?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.350
Actually, I invited her and her fiancÃ©

24:56.380 --> 24:58.600
to watch the Five-Star
finale at your house.

24:59.380 --> 25:01.550
OK. That's... Great.

25:01.580 --> 25:04.229
Mmm... It's going to be a disaster.

25:04.230 --> 25:05.930
First word that came to mind.

25:07.100 --> 25:09.830
- And she's here...
- Who, Sandy?

25:10.010 --> 25:13.960
- Oz, be careful what you say.
- What are you, my mom?

25:14.840 --> 25:16.070
Coward.

25:16.180 --> 25:19.175
- Hey, was that Tia?
- What? Oh, tha... w...

25:19.205 --> 25:21.280
There's a lot of girls in here.

25:21.290 --> 25:22.790
It's hard to keep track.

25:23.900 --> 25:26.420
I just wanted to come
by and say I'm sorry.

25:26.531 --> 25:27.581
Mm.

25:27.630 --> 25:28.890
You didn't need to do that.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.580
Yeah, I did.

25:32.335 --> 25:34.499
I'm sorry that you had
to find out that way

25:34.500 --> 25:36.000
about Hunter and me.

25:37.230 --> 25:38.669
I knew it was going
to be a bit of a shock,

25:38.670 --> 25:39.890
that's why I wanted you to call...

25:39.920 --> 25:43.029
so I could try and take
the sting out of it.

25:43.230 --> 25:46.480
Really? 'cause it kinda seemed
like you couldn't wait to tell me.

25:46.510 --> 25:48.922
Like you were just rubbing my face in it.

25:49.534 --> 25:50.834
Are you serious?

25:53.050 --> 25:54.599
I kinda hoped you'd be happy for me.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.290
Well, I'm happy. I'm ecstatic.

25:57.607 --> 26:01.040
You know what? I should MC your wedding.

26:01.350 --> 26:03.840
I could even take you down the
aisle, wouldn't that be nice?

26:03.950 --> 26:06.159
I could just hand you off, give you over.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.350
Here, Hunter. Have at it.

26:09.880 --> 26:10.669
I wanted you to know

26:10.670 --> 26:13.676
because you're still
really important to me, Oz.

26:14.350 --> 26:17.310
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

26:18.690 --> 26:19.770
A what?

26:20.290 --> 26:21.670
Good talk, Sandy.

26:24.854 --> 26:28.850
Say hi to Hunter for
me. 'Cause that's a name.

26:34.316 --> 26:35.899
There's absolutely no way an extra whisk

26:35.900 --> 26:38.150
was accidentally placed
at Marcel's station.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.119
Yes, you've convinced
us of that, Mr. Werther.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.669
That's not what we're implying.

26:41.770 --> 26:44.419
Right, we're just trying to figure
out exactly how it got there.

26:44.420 --> 26:46.530
Someone must've snuck
it in after final set up.

26:46.560 --> 26:47.689
What's the final set up?

26:47.719 --> 26:49.659
I check the kitchen one
hour before the show.

26:49.660 --> 26:51.280
Immediately before staff lunch.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.590
Is the studio usually
empty during that time?

26:53.620 --> 26:54.890
For the most part, yes.

26:55.330 --> 26:57.419
Sounds like a good time to
sneak something onto the set

26:57.420 --> 26:58.850
without anyone noticing.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.539
Do you remember seeing Raven
or Gabriella at that time?

27:02.540 --> 27:05.550
I saw Raven after lunch,
headed into a dressing room.

27:16.060 --> 27:18.309
- You're OK?
- Sorry, yeah. I've just been...

27:18.310 --> 27:20.810
<i>- getting these headaches.
- The last time we met.</i>

27:21.350 --> 27:23.170
- I remember.
-'Course you do.

27:23.330 --> 27:26.420
Um, is it unusual for Raven to...

27:26.740 --> 27:28.680
shut herself in a room before the show?

27:28.710 --> 27:30.800
No. She usually spent that hour alone.

27:30.810 --> 27:33.539
What about Gabriella? Did you
see her after the final set up?

27:33.540 --> 27:35.200
Yes. I saw her briefly.

27:35.210 --> 27:38.060
On my way to lunch she
passed me in the hall.

27:43.570 --> 27:46.209
Uh, so she didn't have
lunch with you guys?

27:46.210 --> 27:48.539
No. But I wasn't surprised.

27:48.540 --> 27:51.170
She seemed extremely nervous
that day, even for her.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.650
Do you have any idea where she was headed?

27:52.660 --> 27:53.809
No. I have no idea.

27:53.810 --> 27:56.850
- What made you think she was nervous?
- Couple of things.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.110
(Michelle): Toby.

28:04.470 --> 28:07.199
I just... these headaches. Sorry.

28:07.421 --> 28:09.530
Mr. Werther, you've been very helpful.

28:11.170 --> 28:13.570
Yeah, that's all for now. Thank you.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.910
Look, I'm OK. The pain is temporary.

28:19.940 --> 28:21.160
Well, I don't need to be a mind reader

28:21.190 --> 28:22.322
to know that you're lying, Toby.

28:22.352 --> 28:23.519
Yeah, but I got a good read.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.319
It was worth it.

28:24.320 --> 28:26.199
I saw Gabriella walking down the hallway

28:26.200 --> 28:28.129
towards the stage and it
looked like she had an apron

28:28.130 --> 28:29.109
rolled up underneath her arm.

28:29.110 --> 28:30.309
Yeah, big enough to hide a whisk?

28:30.310 --> 28:31.700
Yeah, it looked like it.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.739
I saw Gustov a few steps behind her.

28:33.769 --> 28:35.517
So he must've seen her.

28:35.780 --> 28:38.930
I got dibs by the way on
whatever he's cooking next.

28:39.820 --> 28:44.799
I've no idea where Gabriella
was coming from or going to

28:44.800 --> 28:46.570
on the night in question.

28:46.970 --> 28:50.360
She seems barely aware herself
of these facts 5/8ths of the time.

28:50.390 --> 28:52.260
You can't think she killed Marcel.

28:52.290 --> 28:53.590
Did you know about the affair?

28:53.620 --> 28:55.049
Even I couldn't insulate myself

28:55.050 --> 28:57.120
from that particular piece of scuttlebutt.

28:57.150 --> 28:59.159
It ended quite predictably, I hear.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.039
Do you think she was
angry enough to kill him?

29:01.040 --> 29:03.090
Angry enough? Quite likely.

29:03.120 --> 29:06.090
Confident enough? Definitely not.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.210
<i>Not unless someone put her up to it.</i>

29:08.240 --> 29:10.690
<i>Woman's a doormat in search of a door.</i>

29:10.720 --> 29:13.060
Alright. Thank you for your time.

29:15.190 --> 29:18.029
So, Gabriella had motive and opportunity,

29:18.030 --> 29:19.989
but Gustov doesn't think
that she had the guts.

29:19.990 --> 29:22.429
- Yeah, not on her own, maybe.
- OK, but when you read her

29:22.430 --> 29:24.879
she seemed convinced that Marcel's
death was an accident, right?

29:24.909 --> 29:25.829
Yeah, I know.

29:25.859 --> 29:29.158
- I think it's worth a second look.
- Alright.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.649
I don't know why you've
brought me back here,

29:35.650 --> 29:37.119
<i>I told you everything I know.</i>

29:37.170 --> 29:40.169
Where were you yesterday when
everyone else broke for lunch?

29:40.170 --> 29:43.970
Um. I don't know. I don't remember.

29:45.230 --> 29:48.470
<i>Never should've done
it. Never forgive myself.</i>

29:48.950 --> 29:50.179
You don't remember?

29:50.180 --> 29:53.269
Well, sometimes people do
things they wish they hadn't.

29:53.270 --> 29:55.490
Especially when they're hurt and angry.

29:56.019 --> 29:59.250
<i>Set up to take the fall and played again.</i>

29:59.701 --> 30:01.250
If there's someone else involved in this,

30:01.280 --> 30:02.560
you should let us know.

30:02.670 --> 30:07.650
Someone left a basket in my
trailer, I don't know who.

30:16.450 --> 30:18.817
<i>It had oil and a whisk in it.</i>

30:18.847 --> 30:20.680
You have to believe me.

30:20.710 --> 30:22.530
<i>I don't know where it came from.</i>

30:22.800 --> 30:25.450
Now I wasn't trying to kill Marcel,

30:25.580 --> 30:27.917
I just wanted to wreck his chances

30:27.947 --> 30:29.608
the same way he wrecked mine.

30:29.650 --> 30:32.309
How is peanut oil supposed
to ruin his chances?

30:32.510 --> 30:35.549
Because everyone knew he was
going to make his signature dish.

30:35.550 --> 30:36.876
Which is?

30:37.960 --> 30:39.630
Black truffle meringue.

30:40.770 --> 30:42.600
I'm sorry, I don't think we follow.

30:43.180 --> 30:45.592
Oil is meringue's worst enemy.

30:47.060 --> 30:49.849
I could kick myself for not
having figured this out sooner,

30:49.850 --> 30:52.659
but then again, I always
have been better in the lab

30:52.660 --> 30:53.730
than in the kitchen.

30:53.760 --> 30:56.330
So how is planting a
whisk with peanut oil on it

30:56.360 --> 30:58.299
supposed to bring Marcel down, exactly?

30:58.300 --> 30:59.519
That's the tragic part.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.178
It didn't actually have to be peanut oil.

31:01.208 --> 31:02.830
Any oil would do.

31:02.860 --> 31:04.664
Proteins are made up of amino acids,

31:04.694 --> 31:07.310
some that are attracted to
water, others that are repelled.

31:07.340 --> 31:09.273
So, beating the whites makes

31:09.303 --> 31:11.681
the water-loving bits stick to the water

31:11.711 --> 31:13.830
and the water-hating
bits cling to the air,

31:13.860 --> 31:17.190
So the more you beat it, the
more the whole shebang fluffs up.

31:17.850 --> 31:19.381
Like this.

31:19.630 --> 31:21.054
VoilÃ .

31:21.420 --> 31:23.067
- Impressive.
- But then when you add

31:23.097 --> 31:24.082
the smallest amount of oil

31:24.110 --> 31:25.669
to the chemical mix, the proteins line up

31:25.670 --> 31:28.029
and coat the bubbles
and you end up with goop.

31:28.059 --> 31:30.143
So that tiny bit of oil would've ruined

31:30.173 --> 31:33.139
- his black truffle meringues.
- Kicking him out of the finals.

31:33.140 --> 31:36.020
And serving up some sweet
revenge for Gabriella.

31:36.030 --> 31:39.390
Gabriella was telling the truth.
She didn't meant to kill him.

31:39.420 --> 31:41.320
Whoever set her up may have.

31:42.750 --> 31:43.931
What is it?

31:45.441 --> 31:47.563
I got a glimpse of
something in my first read

31:47.593 --> 31:50.320
of Jesse's that I can't
quite put my finger on.

31:50.350 --> 31:51.890
You want to read him again?

31:52.030 --> 31:53.949
Yeah, look. I know it's a long shot

31:53.950 --> 31:55.749
but it might be the missing in all this.

31:55.750 --> 31:57.950
- You want to risk it?
- I mean, do we have a choice?

31:57.980 --> 32:00.430
There could be another
victim on live tv tonight.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.800
The real killer's still out there.

32:08.060 --> 32:08.939
I'm sure you realize

32:08.940 --> 32:11.360
I have a finale to
prepare for in mere hours.

32:11.390 --> 32:14.170
Everything must be perfect,
everything depends on exactitude.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.910
We apologize, this won't take long at all.

32:15.940 --> 32:17.120
Look, in our first interview

32:17.150 --> 32:19.019
I asked you if you had
noticed anything unusual

32:19.020 --> 32:20.809
- in the past few days.
- Uh-hu.

32:21.060 --> 32:24.020
Unfortunately we didn't have a
chance to discuss those things.

32:24.050 --> 32:26.249
We could just go over
those things one by one,

32:26.250 --> 32:28.109
slowly and carefully. That would be great.

32:28.110 --> 32:31.939
OK. But... There's a lot
of odd things stored up...

32:31.940 --> 32:32.939
My brain stores everything,

32:32.940 --> 32:34.389
it doesn't mean it's important.

32:34.390 --> 32:37.239
It... it might help. Just
tell us what stood out to you.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.240
Alright.

32:39.530 --> 32:40.809
I cracked open a double-yoked egg

32:40.810 --> 32:43.380
approximately 3:15pm, last Tuesday.

32:45.632 --> 32:47.519
Although I don't see
how it could be relevant.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.329
Don't worry about it, just keep going.

32:49.330 --> 32:51.670
I discovered a bent
spoon Wednesday afternoon.

32:55.192 --> 32:57.990
How anyone can misuse utensils
like that is beyond me.

32:58.140 --> 33:00.510
- What else?
- A woman visiting the studio

33:00.540 --> 33:03.139
wore the strangest hat. The
next morning at 8:00 a.m.

33:03.140 --> 33:06.150
I unpacked a semi-final
ingredient. That was a surprise.

33:08.530 --> 33:09.780
- 45 minutes later...
- Wait, wait go back.

33:09.810 --> 33:11.229
The semi-final ingredient,

33:11.259 --> 33:12.850
- black truffle?
- Exactly.

33:12.900 --> 33:14.879
I didn't even know what it
looked like until I saw it

33:14.880 --> 33:17.150
- on the show the other night.
- They're a kind of wild fungi.

33:17.180 --> 33:19.343
Grow on the roots of oak
trees in Italy and France.

33:19.373 --> 33:21.409
Common before the first
world war, now extremely rare.

33:21.410 --> 33:24.780
Hunted with pigs. Or dogs.
Look like black lumps.

33:24.790 --> 33:26.010
Why were you surprised

33:26.040 --> 33:28.059
that it was chosen as
a semi-final ingredient?

33:28.060 --> 33:29.760
Because black truffles
are easy to work with

33:29.790 --> 33:30.860
make everything taste better.

33:30.890 --> 33:32.900
Usually the contestants
have to use a very difficult

33:32.930 --> 33:35.749
ingredient in the final stages
of the competition, right?

33:35.750 --> 33:37.751
The chefs need to prove
they can make a silk purse

33:37.781 --> 33:39.131
from a pig's ear.

33:39.167 --> 33:40.589
One season, it was a pig's ear.

33:40.590 --> 33:41.939
There wouldn't be much of a challenge.

33:41.940 --> 33:43.020
No, and strongly favoured

33:43.050 --> 33:45.410
Marcel because of his signature
black truffle meringues.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.020
Who picked the semi-final ingredient?

33:47.050 --> 33:49.794
Desmond. Invariably.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.190
- Alright.
- (Both): Thank you.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.900
OK, so I'm not exactly a five-star chef.

33:56.930 --> 33:58.290
You're going to have
to run this by me again.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.799
Gabriella told us everyone
that everyone knew Marcel would

34:00.829 --> 34:04.069
make his signature meringues as
soon as black truffle was named

34:04.070 --> 34:05.340
the semi-final ingredient.

34:05.370 --> 34:07.789
So then whoever picked
that signature ingredient...

34:07.790 --> 34:09.458
they knew that Marcel
would do the meringue,

34:09.460 --> 34:10.809
that the oil would ruin the dish,

34:10.810 --> 34:12.139
he'd be kicked out of the competition

34:12.139 --> 34:14.208
And they set Gabriella
up to pull the trigger.

34:14.210 --> 34:15.438
And that person was Desmond?

34:15.440 --> 34:17.579
Apparently he always picks
the surprise ingredient.

34:17.580 --> 34:19.529
Question is, did he know
that it would kill him?

34:19.530 --> 34:21.849
No... see, cause when I
interviewed him he denied

34:21.850 --> 34:23.210
any knowledge of the allergy

34:23.239 --> 34:24.300
and he had proof to back that up.

34:24.330 --> 34:25.810
Right, but you didn't have Toby with you.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.790
I mean, we didn't get a read.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.230
Alright well, release Gabriella,

34:31.260 --> 34:32.270
bring Desmond back in here.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.079
It's two hours before the finale.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.839
I don't care if you gotta
hold his feet to a hibatchi,

34:35.840 --> 34:38.530
I want him in that box
right now. Thank you.

34:41.980 --> 34:44.520
You understand I'm supposed
to be on live television

34:44.550 --> 34:45.889
in less than an hour?

34:45.900 --> 34:47.830
Millions of people are
going to be tuning in.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.420
Right, but not to see Marcel.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.139
You made sure of that, didn't you?

34:51.139 --> 34:52.630
I have no idea what you mean.

34:52.659 --> 34:54.989
He was trying to
blackmail you into the win.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.478
He was going to ruin your career.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.829
So you planted the peanut oil
in Gabriella's dressing room

34:59.830 --> 35:01.030
and set her up to kill him.

35:01.060 --> 35:03.749
I had no idea he was allergic to anything.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.039
Then why did you pick black truffle

35:05.040 --> 35:07.490
as the semi-final ingredient,
knowing that he would make

35:07.520 --> 35:09.220
his signature meringues?

35:11.350 --> 35:15.521
<i>Black truffle are you sure?
That's like handing him the win.</i>

35:16.370 --> 35:18.969
Or maybe you just pretended to
pick the surprise ingredient.

35:18.970 --> 35:22.460
Picking them week after week,
that requires culinary skills.

35:22.490 --> 35:23.670
Skills that you've been faking

35:23.700 --> 35:25.620
since the beginning of your career?

35:25.650 --> 35:27.629
I'm a businessman, OK?

35:27.630 --> 35:29.399
People aren't going to
buy into my restaurants

35:29.400 --> 35:30.429
if they think I can't cook.

35:30.459 --> 35:31.930
Who picks the ingredients?

35:31.960 --> 35:34.260
Who chose black truffle for the semis?

35:36.473 --> 35:39.690
<i>Don't make me repeat myself,
Desmond. I loathe repetition.</i>

35:39.720 --> 35:42.647
<i>It's black truffle, end of conversation.</i>

35:46.190 --> 35:48.680
- Gustav, the judge?
- Yeah.

35:48.710 --> 35:50.019
He was never even on our radar.

35:50.020 --> 35:51.090
Yeah, well, the first time I read him

35:51.120 --> 35:53.370
he seemed genuinely
upset that Marcel died.

35:53.400 --> 35:55.980
Right, maybe he also didn't
know about Marcel's allergy

35:56.010 --> 35:57.939
and just wanted to knock
him out of the competition.

35:57.940 --> 35:59.830
Well why wouldn't Gustav
want Marcel to win?

35:59.860 --> 36:01.749
Remember I got that read
of him in his trailer,

36:01.750 --> 36:02.989
"Only Raven could win now."

36:02.990 --> 36:04.889
At the time I thought he suspected Raven.

36:04.890 --> 36:06.160
Well maybe she was his motive.

36:06.190 --> 36:07.081
Well he did it for her,

36:07.111 --> 36:09.730
- He sabotaged a competition.
- Or he killed him.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.890
Guys the finale starts in 15 minutes.

36:11.900 --> 36:15.060
No evidence, nothing to
trigger an arrest warrant.

36:15.810 --> 36:18.059
Then find some. Accident or not,

36:18.060 --> 36:21.441
Gustav's paying for
Marcel Beaumont's death.

36:25.232 --> 36:26.763
- (Door bell)
- Come in!

36:26.793 --> 36:28.205
(Opens the door)

36:28.330 --> 36:29.840
Did they come? Are they here?

36:30.750 --> 36:32.739
Sandy sent her regrets.
Come on, it's starting.

36:32.740 --> 36:37.050
<i>Welcome to the very special
finale of Five-Star Chef.</i>

36:37.640 --> 36:39.889
<i>Before we start the
show, let's take a moment</i>

36:39.890 --> 36:44.400
to acknowledge the untimely
death of Marcel Beaumont.

36:44.620 --> 36:47.590
Marcel was a marvelous cook...

36:47.690 --> 36:49.589
We need to somehow
prove that Gustav planted

36:49.590 --> 36:50.889
that oil in Gabriella's dressing room.

36:50.890 --> 36:52.759
Gabriella said that she
threw the bottle out.

36:52.760 --> 36:53.939
Yeah Forensics was looking for it

36:53.940 --> 36:55.999
but I don't think they're
going to find any fingerprints.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.349
From my read of Gabriella,

36:57.350 --> 37:00.091
the bottle of oil didn't look
like it came from a store.

37:00.121 --> 37:00.989
It had no labels on it,

37:00.990 --> 37:01.849
it looked more like a vial.

37:01.850 --> 37:03.870
Yeah, maybe it came from a large...

37:04.110 --> 37:07.589
- Wait...
- What? Did you figure it out?

37:07.590 --> 37:09.220
Thai noodles.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.099
When we went to Gustav's trailer,

37:12.100 --> 37:13.690
he made thai noodles.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.759
- Thai cooking uses peanut oil.
- That's right.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.849
He had that big bottle of
it. If we can get a sample

37:17.850 --> 37:18.990
of that oil to Alex,

37:19.020 --> 37:21.400
maybe she can match it to
the oil that killed Marcel.

37:21.410 --> 37:23.339
There's no time... Maybe she already did.

37:23.340 --> 37:25.659
<i>The finals of Five-Star Chef.</i>

37:25.660 --> 37:26.869
<i>It's going to be an exciting night,</i>

37:26.870 --> 37:28.629
so be sure to stick
around after the break.

37:28.630 --> 37:29.589
<i>Is that Michelle and Toby?</i>

37:29.590 --> 37:31.490
<i>What are they doing on live TV?</i>

37:32.780 --> 37:35.350
Wha... No! What?

37:35.840 --> 37:37.550
You're going to have to come with us.

37:37.570 --> 37:38.860
Uh, sounds lovely, dear.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.210
But I'm a tad occupied at the moment.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.010
Yeah I think you've got
bigger problems than judging

37:42.020 --> 37:43.687
a cooking show right now.

37:43.717 --> 37:45.730
It's you who sabotaged Marcel.

37:54.300 --> 37:56.159
You wanted Marcel out of the competition,

37:56.160 --> 37:57.619
you got Gabriella to do it for you.

37:57.620 --> 37:59.150
And why would I do that?

37:59.180 --> 38:00.400
Because you wanted Raven to win

38:00.430 --> 38:02.599
but she was losing out on
the vote week after week.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.250
Nothing but accusation.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.002
- Where's your proof?
- Thank you.

38:06.032 --> 38:08.470
We matched the peanut
oil that killed Marcel

38:08.500 --> 38:11.334
with the oil that we found in your room.

38:17.856 --> 38:21.360
Artisan oils have a very distinct makeup.

38:22.424 --> 38:23.637
We know it was you.

38:25.950 --> 38:27.450
You must believe me.

38:28.362 --> 38:30.866
I... I had no idea the
oil would kill the man,

38:30.896 --> 38:32.970
I was as shocked as anyone else.

38:37.302 --> 38:39.397
Can I have a moment, please?

38:40.377 --> 38:41.676
(Clears his throat)

38:43.100 --> 38:44.180
OK, OK.

38:45.810 --> 38:47.859
I know this is less than
appropriate Miss Masters.

38:47.860 --> 38:50.230
Roll, roll, roll. Go live on this. Go, go!

38:50.240 --> 38:53.390
But it might be the only
chance I have to tell you...

38:57.905 --> 38:59.419
(Crunch)

39:03.260 --> 39:05.400
<i>You're the best chef
I've ever come across.</i>

39:05.910 --> 39:08.440
Sheer genius.

39:08.750 --> 39:12.090
An unadulterated artist,
whom I couldn't sit by

39:12.120 --> 39:15.179
and see outshone by
mere charm and panache.

39:15.180 --> 39:18.147
- Thank you.
- Plus I loathe meringue, don't you?

39:18.177 --> 39:19.601
The very idea.

39:21.900 --> 39:25.140
Well... Looks like the kitchen
takes prisoners after all.

39:38.180 --> 39:41.140
<i>And now, this week
only, 0% financing on...</i>

39:41.170 --> 39:42.990
Best reality TV ever.

39:43.075 --> 39:44.286
<i>He'll drop away with a car.</i>

39:44.304 --> 39:45.514
Drop the mic.

39:48.984 --> 39:51.279
Gustov plead guilty to
manslaughter charges.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.939
So, he really didn't mean to kill Marcel?

39:52.940 --> 39:54.110
Nah, he's just sick and tired

39:54.140 --> 39:56.060
of the most cutthroat competitors winning.

39:56.340 --> 39:58.663
Well. It was still a
very stupid thing to do.

39:58.693 --> 39:59.838
Hey.

40:02.534 --> 40:05.401
Yeah, well, people hurt each other
without meaning to all the time.

40:05.650 --> 40:07.580
Sometimes you don't even
realize you're doing it.

40:07.610 --> 40:08.788
I'll be right back.

40:09.310 --> 40:12.520
- Am I missing something?
- Real reality.

40:16.445 --> 40:19.027
Hey. Um...

40:19.558 --> 40:21.460
- Thanks for dropping by.
- No, I'm actually...

40:21.490 --> 40:22.800
I'm glad you called.

40:23.490 --> 40:25.790
I really didn't mean to
rub it in the other day.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.690
Maybe I could've... handled it better.

40:30.620 --> 40:34.500
Yeah, that. Or I acted
like a complete idiot.

40:35.620 --> 40:38.008
I was jealous and I'm sorry.

40:38.364 --> 40:40.159
It was a stupid way to react.

40:40.160 --> 40:43.100
But if this can make
you feel better, it's...

40:43.385 --> 40:44.756
(Exhales)

40:44.910 --> 40:47.090
its's because you're
still important to me.

40:52.860 --> 40:54.616
That means a lot to me.

40:55.736 --> 40:57.280
I just want you to be happy.

40:57.960 --> 40:59.470
Maybe I'll come to your wedding.

41:00.140 --> 41:01.160
Invite me.

41:01.170 --> 41:03.299
If only to threaten Andre with reservation

41:03.300 --> 41:04.690
if he ever does you wrong.

41:10.926 --> 41:13.910
I know you gonna find the
right person someday, Oz.

41:14.497 --> 41:16.840
You'll make her the
happiest woman in the world.

41:18.125 --> 41:19.264
(Exhales)
