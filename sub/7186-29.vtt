01:49.009 --> 01:51.276

01:51.278 --> 01:52.644
Count me in!

01:52.646 --> 01:53.846
[honking]

01:53.848 --> 01:55.347
Say, mateys!

01:55.349 --> 01:58.016
Wanna help Cubby
become a Sand Pirate?

01:59.285 --> 02:00.519
Great!

02:00.521 --> 02:02.588
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.623
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

02:04.625 --> 02:06.692
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em

02:06.694 --> 02:08.794
and put 'em in
our Team Treasure Chest.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.696
Is everybody ready?

02:10.698 --> 02:12.531
I've got my sword!

02:12.533 --> 02:13.866

02:13.868 --> 02:16.268
And I've got
my Pixie Dust!

02:16.270 --> 02:19.571
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.673
But only in emergencies.

02:21.675 --> 02:25.310
Yo-ho, let's go to

02:51.338 --> 02:54.139
Who's come to see
if they has what it takes

02:54.141 --> 02:57.009
to be a Sand Pirate?

02:57.011 --> 02:58.844
Me, me!

02:58.846 --> 03:01.079
Well done, Master Cubby.

03:01.081 --> 03:04.716
Now, meet me other
Sand Pirate in trainin'.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.385
[all] Bones?!

03:06.387 --> 03:07.452
Aye-aye.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.788
I've always dreamed
of sailin' the sands

03:09.790 --> 03:14.193
and findin' desert treasure
like me hero, Cap'n Flynn!

03:14.195 --> 03:16.795
Wow, it was really nice
of Captain Hook

03:16.797 --> 03:18.397
to let you
try out for this.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.866
Oh, well, you know...

03:20.868 --> 03:23.936
The cap'n always has me
best interests at heart.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.605
[Hook] What in thunder
is this?

03:26.607 --> 03:29.041
Bones has abandoned ship

03:29.043 --> 03:30.809
to join that sand-blastin',

03:30.811 --> 03:33.845
sand dune show-off
Captain Flynn?

03:33.847 --> 03:36.949
Oh, he thought you
wouldn't mind, sir.

03:36.951 --> 03:39.318
Well, he thought incorrectly.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.387
Why would anyone
want to leave me,

03:42.389 --> 03:44.456
the mighty Captain Hook?

03:44.458 --> 03:47.759
Me own crew is the finest
band of buccaneers

03:47.761 --> 03:49.795
ever to sail
the Never Sea.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.796
- [splashing]
- [Smee] Oh!

03:50.798 --> 03:52.931
Great buckets
of barnacles!

03:52.933 --> 03:55.968
- [grunting] Oh!
- [Sharky shouting]

03:55.970 --> 03:57.903
[muffled] Push on, men.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.573
We've got a shipmate to get
back aboard the Jolly Roger.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.276
Where he belongs!

04:05.845 --> 04:07.779
Listen up, boys.

04:07.781 --> 04:11.483
Here's what you gotta do
to be one of me Sand Pirates.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.051
You gotta get a camel

04:13.053 --> 04:15.587
to jump across
the trickiest trails.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.457
You gotta surf
the sandiest sand dunes.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.125
And finally,
you gotta go

04:20.127 --> 04:22.494
to the deepest and hottest
part of the desert

04:22.496 --> 04:24.763
and find
the Giant Sand Castle,

04:24.765 --> 04:27.332
which once belonged
to the ancient pirates

04:27.334 --> 04:28.967
of the Never Land Desert.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.937
Oi! All those
Sand Pirate-y things

04:31.939 --> 04:33.739
to do sound hard.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.441
That's for sure.
But don't worry, Bones.

04:36.443 --> 04:39.344
If we team up,
we can do this together.

04:39.346 --> 04:41.179
Together?
You and me?

04:41.181 --> 04:43.248
It's a deal,
little matey.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.684
Now, your task
is to find

04:45.686 --> 04:49.154
the Giant Sand Castle
hidden deep in the desert.

04:49.156 --> 04:53.058
It's said to be filled
with a golden treasure.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.593
[honking]

04:54.595 --> 04:58.163
<i>¶ I want to be</i>
<i>a Sand Pirate ¶</i>

04:58.165 --> 05:02.234

<i>¶ On a desert gold</i>

05:10.744 --> 05:14.613
I sure hope they pass
the Sand Pirate test.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.648
Oh, they'll be fine.

05:16.650 --> 05:20.052
As long as they keep
their eyes open for trouble.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.586
Like Captain Hook.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.388
And there he is!

05:23.390 --> 05:25.924
That rapscallion Bones
went this way.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.426
Let's follow along,

05:27.428 --> 05:29.828
and make sure that
that slippery sea snake

05:29.830 --> 05:32.831
doesn't bother me
Sand Pirates in trainin'.

05:34.033 --> 05:37.602
Oh! The path is blocked by
all those prickly plants.

05:37.604 --> 05:38.937
How will we get past?

05:38.939 --> 05:41.573
Well, Captain Flynn
said Sand Pirates

05:41.575 --> 05:45.210
have to get a camel
to jump across
the trickiest trails.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.412
All we gotta do
is get Camille

05:47.414 --> 05:50.048
to jump over
the prickly cactus plants

05:50.050 --> 05:52.584
and make it across
Prickly Path.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.619
They went this way, boys.

05:54.621 --> 05:57.789
Follow me,
and step lively.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.858
Ready to cactus jump,
Camille?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.560
[honking] Uh-uh.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.329
Aw, come on, Camille.
If you don't do this,

06:04.331 --> 06:06.198
I won't get to be
a Sand Pirate.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.532
Me neither.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.534
Please help us.
Please!

06:09.536 --> 06:11.269
[honking] OK.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.838
[both] Thanks!

06:12.840 --> 06:16.341
Jump! Jump! Jump!

06:16.343 --> 06:18.844
Yo-ho, way to go.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.113
We got through
the Prickly Path,

06:21.115 --> 06:23.348
and we got
two gold doubloons.

06:23.350 --> 06:27.586
Let's grab 'em and go find
the Giant Sand Castle.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.855
And then we'll be
Sand Pirates!

06:31.524 --> 06:33.992
[groaning, shouting]

06:35.528 --> 06:39.431
Oh, blast!
Me poor bottom.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.101
Where are we, Cubby?

06:43.103 --> 06:45.504
[Cubby] The Surfin' Sand Dunes.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.539
[Bones]
Ooh, sounds like fun.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.609
[both whooping]

06:50.611 --> 06:53.712
A-ha. We're getting
much closer now.

06:53.714 --> 06:57.649
It's time to grab
and snatch Bones.

06:57.651 --> 07:00.085
Look alive, mateys!
It's Hook.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.753
We've gotta stop him.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.055
I've got just the thing.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.725
Ready the Sand Cannon!

07:08.594 --> 07:10.429
Let it blow.

07:12.999 --> 07:16.501
- [engine cranking down]
- [screaming]

07:16.503 --> 07:19.304
[Flynn]
Ahoy, Captain Hook.

07:19.306 --> 07:22.340
[Camille panting]

07:22.342 --> 07:24.543
- Made it!
- [Camille sighing]

07:24.545 --> 07:26.711
Well, we might have
gotten up here, but...

07:26.713 --> 07:27.879
[nervous chuckle]

07:27.881 --> 07:30.215
...gettin' down
might be a little tricky.

07:32.218 --> 07:35.153
[shouting]

07:35.155 --> 07:37.689
Bones, you're a genius!

07:37.691 --> 07:40.358
Captain Flynn
said that Sand Pirates

07:40.360 --> 07:43.495
need to surf
the sandiest sand dunes.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.530
And that's what
you just did.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.599
I am a genius.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.700
[laughing] I am!

07:48.702 --> 07:51.336
Let's all surf down
the sand dune.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.871
Whoo-hoo!

07:52.873 --> 07:56.174
- [all cheering]
- [Cubby] Sand-surf-abunga!

07:56.176 --> 07:58.743
We surfed down
the sand dune,

07:58.745 --> 08:01.313
and we got three more
gold doubloons.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.415
Let's grab 'em and go.

08:03.417 --> 08:08.186
We're one step closer to
being real Sand Pirates.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.690
[shouting]

08:11.692 --> 08:13.725
What's Hook
doin' out here?

08:13.727 --> 08:17.095
Where there's treasure,
there's the captain.

08:17.097 --> 08:20.365
And if he knows we're looking
for the Giant Sand Castle,

08:20.367 --> 08:23.001
then you know he's
on his way to get it

08:23.003 --> 08:24.936
before we find it.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.471
Aw, coconuts!

08:26.473 --> 08:28.607
We've gotta
find the castle first,

08:28.609 --> 08:31.042
or we won't get to be
Sand Pirates.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.812
[gasps]
Say it ain't so!

08:37.016 --> 08:40.252
If only I had water
to wet me whistle.

08:40.254 --> 08:42.921
If only I
could find Bones.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.723
[groaning]

08:44.725 --> 08:47.392
[Bones] Captain,
are you all right?

08:47.394 --> 08:49.828
Bones? Is that you?

08:49.830 --> 08:52.097
I must be seeing things.

08:52.099 --> 08:55.400
No, it's me, Cap'n.
But what about you?

08:55.402 --> 08:57.202
Looks like you need
a little water.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.436
Here.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.373
[all gulping]

09:01.375 --> 09:03.141
[all sighing]

09:03.143 --> 09:05.944
You are a life-saver,
Bones!

09:05.946 --> 09:08.179
But I thought
you left me to join

09:08.181 --> 09:11.349
that sandy,
swashbucklin' swab, Flynn.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.552
Oh, I'd never leave you!

09:13.554 --> 09:16.855
You'll always be me
number one cap'n, Cap'n.

09:16.857 --> 09:20.258
And what about your wanting
to be a Sand Pirate?

09:20.260 --> 09:23.662
Oh, that's just
a part-time thing.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.096
Doesn't matter now.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.933
We were supposed to find
the Giant Sand Castle.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.268
But we... we failed.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.671
Oh, not so, me hearties.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.006
Even though you didn't
find the castle,

09:35.008 --> 09:37.475
you did something
way more important.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.477
You helped
a mate in need,

09:39.479 --> 09:44.049
and that is what
truly makes a Sand Pirate.

09:44.051 --> 09:47.485
Well done!
You both passed the test.

09:47.487 --> 09:50.388
Awesome coconuts!

09:50.390 --> 09:52.624
Now we're Sand Pirates.

09:52.626 --> 09:55.293
And we got five more
gold doubloons.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.462
Let's grab 'em and go.

09:57.464 --> 10:00.065
Oh, I sure wish
we coulda found

10:00.067 --> 10:03.101
that big old
Giant Sand Castle.

10:03.103 --> 10:06.838
[chuckling] Well, you're
practically on top of it!

10:06.840 --> 10:09.407
[rumbling]

10:09.409 --> 10:11.643
- [Cubby] Wow!
- [Bones] Look at that!

10:11.645 --> 10:14.145
- Great galleons!
- Thunder and lightning!

10:14.147 --> 10:16.615
[Smee] Amazing!

10:16.617 --> 10:20.085
Why, that's the legendary
Giant Sand Castle.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.687
Now remember, lads.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.589
Always be at the ready,

10:24.591 --> 10:28.326
if I ever need the help
of me Sand Pirates.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.762
[both] Aye-aye,
Captain Flynn!

10:30.764 --> 10:32.864
Uh, pardon me,
Captain Flynn,

10:32.866 --> 10:36.034
but I've heard tell
this Sand Castle

10:36.036 --> 10:38.603
is filled with
golden treasure.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.405
Is it true?

10:40.407 --> 10:42.741
Aye, that it is, Hook.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.476
Help yourself.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.444
Oh, with pleasure!

10:46.446 --> 10:50.281
OK, crew. It's time we
head back to Pirate Island.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.283
But it's such
a long way.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.052
Not a problem, Cubby.

10:54.054 --> 10:57.088
Pixie Dust away!

10:57.090 --> 10:59.324
- [all] Goodbye!
- Bye, Captain Flynn.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.126
Farewell to ye!

11:01.128 --> 11:05.363
Thanks for helping Cubby
become a Sand Pirate, mateys!

11:05.365 --> 11:07.832
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

11:07.834 --> 11:09.834
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.277
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:19.279 --> 11:21.246
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:21.248 --> 11:23.381
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>with help from you ¶</i>

11:23.383 --> 11:26.351
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

11:26.353 --> 11:28.653
Come on.
Count with us.

11:28.655 --> 11:31.189
[all] Yeah!

11:31.191 --> 11:35.827
[Cubby] One, two,
three, four,

11:35.829 --> 11:39.097
five, six, seven, eight,

11:39.099 --> 11:40.999
nine, ten!

11:41.001 --> 11:42.367
[Jake] Yo-ho.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.335
For solving
Pirate Problems today,

11:44.337 --> 11:46.838
we got ten
gold doubloons.

11:46.840 --> 11:50.041
And we've got our own
Giant Sand Castle.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.411
Made by a genuine
Sand Pirate... me!

11:55.715 --> 11:58.783
Soon the treasure
of the Giant Sand Castle

11:58.785 --> 12:00.452
will be mine.

12:02.154 --> 12:03.555
Oh, my.

12:03.557 --> 12:07.058
The golden treasure of
the Giant Sand Castle is...

12:07.060 --> 12:08.760
...sand!

12:08.762 --> 12:11.930
Sand... blast!

12:15.534 --> 12:17.001
<i>[Jake]</i> "Song of the Desert."

12:20.940 --> 12:23.908
<i>¶ Oh, my name</i>
<i>be Captain Flynn ¶</i>

12:25.411 --> 12:28.379
<i>¶ A'sailin' on</i>
<i>the desert wind ¶</i>

12:28.381 --> 12:31.149
<i>¶ I'm the legendary</i>
<i>Captain Flynn ¶</i>

12:31.151 --> 12:32.650
<i>¶ Ha-ha </i>

12:32.652 --> 12:33.785
Blast.

12:33.787 --> 12:36.421
What's he doing back here?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.556
<i>¶ Oh, my name be</i>
<i>Captain Flynn ¶</i>

12:38.558 --> 12:40.024
Why, he's singing.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.360
Like a birdie, he is.

12:42.362 --> 12:46.664
You know, the three of you
would make a delightful trio.

12:46.666 --> 12:50.735
Ah. A delightful trio.

12:50.737 --> 12:55.373
Lads, I want you to ask Flynn
to sing with you at a concert.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.343
Somewhere far,
far away from here.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.978
And while you're gone,

12:59.980 --> 13:04.082
Smee and I will plunder
his Golden Pirate Beetle.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.819
Oh, sounds good, sir,
but there is no concert.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.387
Exactly.

13:09.389 --> 13:13.625
Pretend there's a concert
and fool that Flynn.

13:15.928 --> 13:18.730
So, you two want me
to sing with you

13:18.732 --> 13:22.467
at a special Swashbucklin'
Shanty Singin' Songfest

13:22.469 --> 13:25.336
that's far, far away
from here?

13:25.338 --> 13:27.972
That be the one, Cap'n.

13:27.974 --> 13:31.009
Why, I'd be honored!

13:31.011 --> 13:32.410
[Jake] Yay-hey.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.746
- Sounds exciting.
- [Sharky] Jake?

13:34.748 --> 13:36.047
[stammering]

13:36.049 --> 13:37.482
Where'd you
come from, matey?

13:37.484 --> 13:38.950
We were down below deck,

13:38.952 --> 13:40.985
shaking sand
out of our boots.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.588
Jake and his sea rats?

13:43.590 --> 13:44.823
Blast!

13:44.825 --> 13:46.858
If you'll excuse me,
little mateys,

13:46.860 --> 13:49.427
I'm off to join
Sharky and Bones

13:49.429 --> 13:52.964
at the Swashbucklin'
Shanty Singin' Songfest.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.265
Hang on.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.801
I've never heard of
this Songfest before.

13:56.803 --> 14:00.505
You sure this isn't one of
old Feather Hat's sneaky tricks?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.607
Hmm. Good point.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.742
For a long time,
Captain Hook

14:04.744 --> 14:07.679
has been lookin' to swipe
me pyramid's treasure.

14:07.681 --> 14:11.316
Like me precious
Golden Pirate Beetle.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.151
Not to worry,
Captain Flynn.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.587
We'll pirate-sit your pyramid
while you're gone,

14:15.589 --> 14:18.823
and we'll make sure Captain Hook
doesn't cause any trouble.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.359
A fortune of thanks
to ye, mateys.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.394
In case ye needs me help,

14:23.396 --> 14:25.430
just pull the red lever
on the wall

14:25.432 --> 14:28.366
to set off
me pyramid alarm.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.835
<i>¶ Have you heard</i>
<i>of Captain Flynn? ¶</i>

14:30.837 --> 14:32.370
Aye-aye, Captain.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.807
Say, mateys, want to help us
pirate-sit the pyramid?

14:37.443 --> 14:39.844
Yay-hey, OK!

14:39.846 --> 14:41.813
Keep a lookout
for gold doubloons.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.915
Whenever we solve
a Pirate Problem together,

14:43.917 --> 14:46.017
they'll appear.
Then we'll collect 'em

14:46.019 --> 14:48.319
and put 'em in our Team
Treasure Chest.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.255
Yo-ho, let's go!

14:52.992 --> 14:55.693
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys, away! </i>

14:55.695 --> 14:58.463
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

14:58.465 --> 14:59.864
<i>¶ Let's go </i>

14:59.866 --> 15:02.533
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

15:02.535 --> 15:05.970
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

15:05.972 --> 15:07.939
<i>¶ And me </i>

15:11.210 --> 15:15.580
This must be where Captain Flynn
keeps his Golden Pirate Beetle.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.883
[Cubby] And look.
A fancy red lever.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.518
Careful, Cubby.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.421
Captain Flynn said
if we pull the red lever,

15:23.423 --> 15:25.390
it will set off
the alarm.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.091
[doorbell ringing]

15:27.093 --> 15:29.294
[gasps] Oh, no!
The alarm.

15:29.296 --> 15:32.430
That's no alarm.
It's just the doorbell.

15:34.366 --> 15:35.700
[Izzy] Who is it, Jake?

15:35.702 --> 15:37.902
I don't know.
No one's there.

15:37.904 --> 15:40.104
[doorbell ringing]

15:40.106 --> 15:42.607
Hey, someone
left a note.

15:47.813 --> 15:51.349
The note says,
"Don't look behind you."

15:51.351 --> 15:53.151
Huh?

15:53.153 --> 15:54.752
[all] Captain Hook!

15:54.754 --> 15:57.255
[grunts] Ah-ha-ha!

15:57.257 --> 15:58.856
[shouting]

16:00.793 --> 16:03.027
- [grunting]
- Aw, crackers!

16:03.029 --> 16:06.864
We fell for the oldest trick
in the Sneaky Snook book.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.499
That's right.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.869
The old Pirate Pyramid
Doorbell Ditch!

16:11.871 --> 16:13.905
We sure didn't
see that coming.

16:13.907 --> 16:16.274
Now, would you please
open the door?

16:16.276 --> 16:20.111
Sorry, but I have a Golden
Pirate Beetle to plunder.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.379
Ah, ta-ta!

16:21.381 --> 16:23.081
Aw, coconuts!

16:23.083 --> 16:25.883
Now how are we gonna get
back inside the pyramid?

16:25.885 --> 16:27.652
The peephole is still open.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.654
All we need
is someone small enough

16:29.656 --> 16:32.623
to squeeze right through and
open the door to let us in.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.293
And I wonder who
that could be.

16:35.295 --> 16:39.764
Open says me!

16:39.766 --> 16:41.599
Way to go, Skully.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.601
We opened up the door
of the pyramid,

16:43.603 --> 16:46.170
and we got two
gold doubloons.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.941
Let's grab 'em
and go find Captain Hook.

16:49.943 --> 16:52.710
[Hook] Watch it, Smee,
you're stepping on me foot!

16:52.712 --> 16:54.645
[Smee] Oh, dear.
Sorry, Cap'n.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.214
Hook must have
gone this way

16:56.216 --> 16:58.683
to get the Golden
Pirate Beetle.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.619
Should we pull the alarm
and warn Captain Flynn?

17:01.621 --> 17:04.989
I think we can handle
Old Feather Hat
by ourselves.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.592
Skully's right.
Besides, we don't want

17:07.594 --> 17:10.061
to spoil Captain Flynn's
first concert.

17:10.063 --> 17:12.263
<i>¶ Who hasn't heard of</i>
<i>Captain Flynn? ¶</i>

17:12.265 --> 17:14.532
<i>¶ He's a super</i>
<i>famous buccaneer ¶</i>

17:14.534 --> 17:17.402
<i>¶ Well, it's true</i>
<i>I had a fine career ¶</i>

17:17.404 --> 17:19.871
<i>¶ He knows the sea like</i>
<i>the back of his hand ¶</i>

17:19.873 --> 17:23.041
<i>¶ Now I set my sails</i>
<i>across the sand ¶</i>

17:23.043 --> 17:25.243
<i>¶ Oh, my name be</i>
<i>Captain Flynn ¶</i>

17:25.245 --> 17:27.245
<i>¶ The legendary</i>
<i>Captain Flynn ¶</i>

17:27.247 --> 17:29.714
<i>- ¶ The legendary </i>
<i>- Don't overdo it, boys.</i>

17:29.716 --> 17:33.918
<i>¶ Captain Flynn </i>

17:41.126 --> 17:42.660
There it is, Smee.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.363
The Golden Pirate Beetle.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.433
[shouting]

17:48.435 --> 17:50.902
Blasted Flynn
and his booby traps!

17:50.904 --> 17:53.438
Looks like someone
needs a little help.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.040
Captain Hook
never needs help.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.843
No, but Mr. Smee does.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.478
You know,
if you're offering.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.681
[laughing]
All right, Mr. Smee.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.317
We'll let you
and Captain Hook
out of the cage,

18:06.319 --> 18:10.154
but only if you promise
not to cause anymore trouble.

18:10.156 --> 18:13.291
Me? Cause trouble?

18:13.293 --> 18:16.094
I wouldn't dream of it,
dear girl.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.863
Maybe if we all
pull on this vine,

18:18.865 --> 18:21.933
we can lift the cage
and free Hook and Smee.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.469
[all] Pull! Pull!

18:25.938 --> 18:27.271
Yay-hey!

18:27.273 --> 18:29.574
We freed Hook and Smee
from the cage,

18:29.576 --> 18:32.276
and we got four more
gold doubloons.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.445
Let's grab 'em and go.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.814
Let's grab 'em, indeed.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.950
Yay-hey, no way!

18:38.952 --> 18:43.087
You promised you wouldn't
cause any more trouble.

18:43.089 --> 18:47.225
Yes, but swiping this treasure
is no trouble at all.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.560
See? Ha-ha!

18:49.562 --> 18:51.395
What in plunder?

18:51.397 --> 18:53.131
[stammering] Bug!

18:53.133 --> 18:55.366
[screaming]

18:55.368 --> 18:57.101
[sounding charge]

18:57.103 --> 18:58.569
[buzzing]

18:58.571 --> 19:00.505
[shouting] Oh, dear!

19:00.507 --> 19:02.240
Shoo! Go away!

19:02.242 --> 19:05.009
Let's get outta here!

19:05.011 --> 19:06.177
Whoa!

19:06.179 --> 19:08.980
Smee! Go, go!

19:10.482 --> 19:11.983
Sorry, Cap'n.

19:11.985 --> 19:15.153
Blasted beetles!
Move like the wind, Smee!

19:15.155 --> 19:17.388
Hurry!

19:17.390 --> 19:21.392
We oughta pull the alarm
and call for Captain Flynn!

19:21.394 --> 19:28.032
<i>[slowly] ¶ Who hasn't</i>
<i>heard of Captain Fly... ¶</i>

19:28.034 --> 19:30.067
You know, lads, I, uh,

19:30.069 --> 19:32.603
thought we woulda been
at the Songfest by now.

19:32.605 --> 19:33.971
[alarm ringing]

19:33.973 --> 19:36.841
[gasps] Me pirate
pyramid's alarm!

19:36.843 --> 19:38.576
[shrieking]

19:42.714 --> 19:44.782
Let's get out
of here, Smee!

19:44.784 --> 19:47.585
But we left
the Golden Beetle.

19:47.587 --> 19:49.587
Whatever you say, Cap'n.

19:51.223 --> 19:53.391
We've gotta put
the Golden Pirate Beetle back

19:53.393 --> 19:55.126
to stop this bug swarm.

19:55.128 --> 19:57.828
Look! With all these
beetles bugging him,

19:57.830 --> 19:59.430
Hook must have dropped it.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.933
But how can we get it
back where it belongs

20:01.935 --> 20:04.001
with all these bugs
in the way?

20:04.003 --> 20:05.803
This is an emergency!

20:05.805 --> 20:09.040
Pixie Dust away!

20:10.742 --> 20:13.177
I got this one, mateys.

20:15.180 --> 20:16.881
Hold on, mateys!

20:16.883 --> 20:18.816
Captain Flynn's a'comin'.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.955
Yay-hey!
We used Pixie Dust

20:23.957 --> 20:25.690
to put the Golden
Pirate Beetle

20:25.692 --> 20:27.491
back where it belongs,

20:27.493 --> 20:30.127
and we got four more
gold doubloons.

20:30.129 --> 20:32.129
Let's grab 'em and go.

20:34.266 --> 20:35.666
Ahoy, mateys.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.169
I heard the alarm
a'soundin'.

20:38.171 --> 20:39.570
Is everything all right?

20:39.572 --> 20:42.073
Captain Hook tried to
hook the Golden Beetle,

20:42.075 --> 20:44.308
but everything's
shipshape now.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.410
Why, I knew
me pyramid home

20:46.412 --> 20:48.012
was safe in your hands.

20:48.014 --> 20:50.314
And I was right!

20:50.316 --> 20:53.951
'Tis a shame
our pirate trio
never got to sing

20:53.953 --> 20:57.622
in the Swashbucklin' Shanty
Singin' Songfest, boys.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.291
[sighs]
Truth be told, Cap'n,

21:00.293 --> 21:02.827
there weren't no Songfest.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.263
T'was all the Cap'n's
sneaky scheme

21:05.265 --> 21:07.131
to get you away
from your pyramid,

21:07.133 --> 21:10.001
so he could swipe
the Golden Pirate Beetle.

21:10.003 --> 21:13.170
- We're sorry.
- Oh, so sorry, Cap'n.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.606
We really wish we could
still sing with you

21:15.608 --> 21:18.042
in a pirate-y trio.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.845
Well, maybe we still can.

21:23.181 --> 21:25.483
<i>¶ Oh, it's buccaneers we be </i>

21:25.485 --> 21:28.819

<i>¶ The singin' buccaneers</i>

21:48.106 --> 21:49.940
Thanks for helping us
pirate-sit

21:49.942 --> 21:52.176
Captain Flynn's pyramid,
matey's.

21:52.178 --> 21:54.078
Now let's put all
our gold doubloons

21:54.080 --> 21:55.746
into our Team
Treasure Chest.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.222
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

22:05.224 --> 22:07.325

22:09.329 --> 22:12.296
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons ¶</i>

22:12.298 --> 22:14.665
Come on.
Count with us.

[Jake] Yo-ho! For solving
Pirate Problems today,

22:30.216 --> 22:33.818
we got ten
gold doubloons.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.053
And I'm still
pirate-sitting.

22:36.055 --> 22:39.323
See? I'm sitting
on a pirate!

22:39.325 --> 22:41.325
[all laughing]

22:43.795 --> 22:46.330
[Hook] Blasted bugs!

22:46.332 --> 22:48.699
Thanks to them,
once again,

22:48.701 --> 22:51.769
I end up with
no treasure at all!

22:51.771 --> 22:54.705
Oh, but look you've brought
back a little friend.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.940
Little friend?

22:55.942 --> 22:58.542
What little friend?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.611
- [buzzing]
- [screaming]

23:00.613 --> 23:03.748
I hate bugs!

23:12.724 --> 23:14.692
<i>¶ To brew a bunch</i>
<i>of Pirate Rock ¶</i>

23:14.694 --> 23:16.427

<i>¶ Here's Grandmama's</i>

23:23.636 --> 23:27.104
