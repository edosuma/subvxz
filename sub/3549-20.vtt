WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:05.336
LYNETTE WENT BACK TO WORK,
AND TOM FILLED HIS DAYS...

00:05.336 --> 00:08.007
YOU'RE GOOD
AT THIS GIRL TALK THING.
 WELL, THANKS.

00:08.007 --> 00:11.142
DO YOU AT LEAST KNOW
 WHY HE STEALS?
 I STEAL TO HURT YOU.

00:11.142 --> 00:14.215
BREE STRUGGLED TO UNDERSTAND
HER HUSBAND'S PROBLEM,

00:14.215 --> 00:16.317
WHILE DOWN THE STREET,

00:16.317 --> 00:20.521
EDIE FINALLY FIGURED OUT
HER HUSBAND'S PLAN...
 YOU MARRIED ME

00:20.521 --> 00:24.055
SO YOU COULD GET CLOSE TO
THE MAN WHO KILLED YOUR FAMILY.
 HE WAS NEVER PUNISHED.

00:24.055 --> 00:26.197
AAH! (gags and gasps)

00:26.197 --> 00:28.459
(grunts)

00:28.459 --> 00:31.202
(gasping)

00:31.202 --> 00:33.064
(cries)

00:35.106 --> 00:37.208
(beeping)

00:37.208 --> 00:38.469
AAH!
 (tires squeal)

00:42.113 --> 00:44.515
(Mary Alice)
ROSE KEMPER WAS A SURVIVOR.

00:44.515 --> 00:48.479
YOU COULD SEE THAT
BY LOOKING INTO HER EYES.

00:48.479 --> 00:51.522
SHE HAD BURIED ONE HUSBAND,

00:51.522 --> 00:54.125
GIVEN BIRTH TO FIVE CHILDREN,

00:54.125 --> 00:56.727
SURVIVED ILLNESS, BANKRUPTCY,

00:56.727 --> 01:00.091
EVEN THE LOSS OF HER TEETH...

01:00.091 --> 01:01.832
AS A RESULT,

01:01.832 --> 01:05.836
ROSE KEMPER WAS
NO LONGER AFRAID OF ANYTHING.

01:07.538 --> 01:11.672
SADLY, THE MAN WHO CLIMBED
INTO HER WINDOW THAT NIGHT

01:11.672 --> 01:14.105
WAS UNAWARE OF THIS...

01:14.105 --> 01:16.407
(thud)

01:16.407 --> 01:19.710
BUT ROSE WAS MORE THAN HAPPY

01:19.710 --> 01:22.213
TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.560
GET OUT OF HERE!
JUST GET THE HELL OUT!

01:29.560 --> 01:33.093
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.
DO YOU HEAR ME?!

01:33.093 --> 01:35.526
(beeping)

01:38.699 --> 01:40.871
(tires squeal, crash)

01:40.871 --> 01:42.803
(crackling)

01:48.108 --> 01:52.243
MRS. KEMPER?

01:52.243 --> 01:54.245
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

01:54.245 --> 01:57.618
KATHERINE!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:57.618 --> 01:59.650
OH, I HEARD
YOU WEREN'T FEELING WELL,

01:59.650 --> 02:01.722
SO I BROUGHT YOU
SOME FLOWERS.
 OHH.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.325
THE DOCTORS TELL ME
YOU HAD A MILD HEART ATTACK.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.898
DID THEY TELL YOU WHY?

02:07.898 --> 02:10.701
IT WAS DEATH.

02:10.701 --> 02:12.433
HE CAME FOR ME.

02:13.864 --> 02:15.536
DEATH CAME FOR YOU?

02:15.536 --> 02:19.670
BUT I CHASED HIM OUT
WITH MY BASEBALL BAT.

02:19.670 --> 02:23.874
I GAVE HIM A GOOD WHACK, TOO,
RIGHT ON THE OLD NOGGIN.

02:23.874 --> 02:26.917
(laughs) HOW MUCH MORPHINE
DO THEY HAVE YOU ON?

02:26.917 --> 02:31.322
YOU KNOW THAT SHELF
WHERE I KEEP MY KNICKKNACKS?

02:31.322 --> 02:33.324
HE TRIED TO TAKE ONE.

02:33.324 --> 02:36.156
DEATH COLLECTS KNICKKNACKS.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.490
AND WHEN HE COULDN'T GET ME,
HE WENT AFTER THAT OTHER LADY--

02:39.490 --> 02:41.732
THE ONE WHO CRASHED.

02:41.732 --> 02:43.694
EDIE BRITT?

02:43.694 --> 02:46.897
OH, YES,
AND I SAW EVERYTHING.

02:46.897 --> 02:49.870
DEATH JUST STAGGERED
OUT INTO THE STREET,

02:49.870 --> 02:52.343
AND HE RAISED HIS HANDS

02:52.343 --> 02:56.277
AND HE MADE HER RUN
INTO THAT LIGHT POLE.

02:58.309 --> 03:00.281
KATHERINE...

03:00.281 --> 03:02.683
YOU BELIEVE ME,
DON'T YOU?

03:02.683 --> 03:06.287
OH, I WOULD NEVER
MAKE ANYTHING LIKE THIS UP.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.959
I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T,
SWEETHEART.

03:08.959 --> 03:11.792
LISTEN,
I'LL STOP BY TOMORROW.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.795
YOU JUST GET YOUR REST,
OKAY?

03:16.527 --> 03:18.729
UH, KATHERINE?

03:18.729 --> 03:21.672
IF YOU SEE DEATH
LURKING IN THE HALL,

03:21.672 --> 03:24.675
YOU TELL HIM HE BETTER NOT
COME AROUND HERE,

03:24.675 --> 03:27.638
'CAUSE I AM
NOT AFRAID OF HIM.

03:29.940 --> 03:34.985
NO, ROSE KEMPER WAS NOT AFRAID
OF ANYTHING...

03:34.985 --> 03:39.650
BUT THE MAN
WHO HAD BROKEN INTO HER HOME...

03:39.650 --> 03:55.235
WAS NOW VERY AFRAID
OF ROSE KEMPER.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.769
THE FACT IS EVERYONE DOES IT--

03:58.769 --> 04:02.743
SOMETIMES WITH THE HELP
OF AN OVERTURNED CUSHION...

04:04.975 --> 04:09.950
SOMETIMES BY MEANS
OF A LARGE POTTED PLANT...

04:11.782 --> 04:15.656
OTHER TIMES USING
THE TOP BUTTON OF A SHIRT.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.560
YES, EVERYONE HAS SOMETHING

04:19.560 --> 04:22.663
THEY WANT TO KEEP HIDDEN
FROM PRYING EYES...

04:22.663 --> 04:25.896
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE YOU GOT
THIS BUMP JUST BY FALLING.

04:25.896 --> 04:28.999
BUT SOME PEOPLE ARE BETTER
AT COVER-UPS THAN OTHERS.

04:28.999 --> 04:30.971
I KNOW,
BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.974
I WENT FOR A WALK, I TRIPPED,
AND I HIT MY HEAD ON THE CURB.

04:33.974 --> 04:37.648
OKAY, WELL, EVERYTHING'S
LOOKING MUCH BETTER.

04:37.648 --> 04:40.651
I SEE NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN'T
BE RELEASED THIS WEEKEND.

04:40.651 --> 04:42.983
REALLY? THAT SOON?

04:42.983 --> 04:45.816
YOU CAN PICK HIM UP
IN THE AFTERNOON.

04:45.816 --> 04:48.919
ORSON, I'LL CHECK IN
ONE MORE TIME BEFORE YOU GO.

04:53.023 --> 04:55.826
WELL, YOU DON'T SEEM
ALL THAT THRILLED

04:55.826 --> 04:58.629
ABOUT THE PROSPECT
OF ME COMING HOME.

04:58.629 --> 05:00.971
HONEY, I DON'T MEAN
TO BE NEGATIVE.

05:00.971 --> 05:02.933
IT'S JUST...

05:02.933 --> 05:05.075
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

05:05.075 --> 05:08.038
WILL YOU KEEP STEALING
AND LYING TO ME?

05:10.781 --> 05:13.644
I LOVE YOU, BUT I JUST CAN'T
PUT UP WITH THAT ANYMORE.

05:13.644 --> 05:15.946
DON'T WORRY.
THINGS ARE GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

05:15.946 --> 05:19.550
HOW?
 WELL, I'VE BEEN DOING
A LOT OF THINKING LATELY,

05:19.550 --> 05:21.552
AND I'VE DECIDED...

05:21.552 --> 05:24.024
FINALLY, TO BE HAPPY.

05:24.024 --> 05:28.098
HOW CAN YOU JUST DECIDE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

05:28.098 --> 05:29.860
LOOK...

05:29.860 --> 05:34.064
THERE ARE THINGS THAT
I DON'T LIKE ABOUT MY LIFE,

05:34.064 --> 05:37.107
BUT THERE IS SO MUCH
THAT IS GOOD.

05:37.107 --> 05:42.072
DO I REALLY WANNA RISK
LOSING EVERYTHING?

05:42.072 --> 05:45.646
I MEAN, IF I CAN DECIDE
TO BE RESENTFUL AND JEALOUS,

05:45.646 --> 05:48.579
I CAN DAMN WELL DECIDE
TO BE HAPPY...

05:48.579 --> 05:53.384
AND BE THE KIND OF HUSBAND
THAT YOU DESERVE.

05:54.885 --> 05:57.728
DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT?

05:57.728 --> 05:59.730
I DO.

05:59.730 --> 06:03.564
I HOPE SO, BECAUSE I JUST
CANNOT TAKE ANY MORE LYING.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.966
YOU WON'T HAVE TO.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.473
I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT.

06:15.946 --> 06:17.978
DAVE?

06:17.978 --> 06:21.081
HELLO?

06:21.081 --> 06:22.983
DAVE?

06:27.588 --> 06:30.591
HE DIDN'T ANSWER.
 OKAY, NOW I'M STARTING
TO GET WORRIED.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.593
YEAH, I LEFT THAT CASSEROLE
THREE DAYS AGO,

06:32.593 --> 06:34.094
AND IT'S STILL THERE.

06:34.094 --> 06:37.097
I'M SURPRISED THE SQUIRRELS
HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO IT.
 MAYBE THEY DID.

06:37.097 --> 06:40.100
ANYBODY SEEN
ANY DEAD SQUIRRELS AROUND HERE?
 EVEN IF DAVE
WANTS TO BE ALONE,

06:40.100 --> 06:43.133
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE HE'S TAKEN
CARE OF. WE OWE IT TO EDIE.

06:43.133 --> 06:46.607
I SAY WE KEEP SHOWING UP HERE
UNTIL HE LETS US HELP HIM.
 WE NEED TO BE ANNOYING
AND PERSISTENT.

06:46.607 --> 06:49.610
WE'RE GOOD AT THAT.
 SO WHO CAN COME BY LATER
AND CHECK ON HIM?

06:49.610 --> 06:51.612
I'D DO IT,
BUT I'M WORKING LATE.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.044
I'M IN THE CLASSROOM ALL DAY,
AND I HAVE MEETINGS AFTER.

06:54.044 --> 06:58.018
I HAVE A REHEARSAL DINNER
TO CATER.
 UGH, AND I HAVE
A GARDEN CLUB MEETING.

06:59.890 --> 07:02.092
YOU'RE IN A GARDEN CLUB?

07:02.092 --> 07:04.555
YEAH, I JUST JOINED.

07:04.555 --> 07:06.557
WAIT. THERE WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO BE ACTUAL GARDENERS

07:06.557 --> 07:09.960
IN THIS CLUB, WOULD THERE?
 HOT SHIRTLESS GARDENERS

07:09.960 --> 07:12.202
WITH GREAT ABS
AND LEARNER'S PERMITS?

07:12.202 --> 07:15.666
GEE, THIS BIT JUST GETS FUNNIER
AND FUNNIER.

07:15.666 --> 07:17.668
OH, WE TEASE
BECAUSE WE LOVE.

07:17.668 --> 07:20.440
NOW BACK TO DAVE. (gasps) I'LL
ASK MIKE TO CHECK IN ON HIM.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.443
THAT'D BE GREAT.
 REMEMBER TO TELL HIM
"ANNOYING AND PERSISTENT."

07:23.443 --> 07:26.446
AND I CAN MAKE
ANOTHER CASSEROLE.
 YEAH, 'CAUSE
HE HASN'T SUFFERED ENOUGH.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.818
(laughs)

07:27.818 --> 07:31.582
THAT'S A BIT
THAT I NEVER GET TIRED OF.

07:31.582 --> 07:32.783
(scoffs)

07:32.783 --> 07:35.055
DAVE? HELLO?

07:35.055 --> 07:36.657
IT'S MIKE.

07:40.230 --> 07:41.632
DAVE?

07:41.632 --> 07:43.093
DAVE?

07:43.093 --> 07:44.795
(knocks on glass)

07:48.739 --> 07:51.071
HEY, I'M, UH,
SORRY TO BARGE IN.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.073
I JUST WANT TO MAKE
SURE YOU'RE OKAY.

08:01.812 --> 08:04.484
KATHERINE MADE YOU LASAGNA.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.087
THOUGHT I'D BE A GOOD IDEA
TO EAT SOMETHING.

08:10.761 --> 08:13.493
WANT ME
TO GET YOU A PLATE?

08:13.493 --> 08:14.925
I'M GOOD.

08:14.925 --> 08:16.066
(clears throat)

08:19.630 --> 08:21.131
YOU'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

08:21.131 --> 08:22.873
BUDDY, YOU WILL.

08:22.873 --> 08:24.875
LOOK, I HAVE
GONE THROUGH SOME REALLY--

08:24.875 --> 08:26.877
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH NOTHING.

08:26.877 --> 08:28.839
AND IF YOU STAND THERE

08:28.839 --> 08:31.842
AND TRY TO TELL ME
YOU UNDERSTAND HOW I FEEL,

08:31.842 --> 08:34.715
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I'M GONNA LOSE MY MIND.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.015
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.849
YOU CAN'T, OKAY?

08:38.849 --> 08:40.851
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
TO KATHERINE

08:40.851 --> 08:43.854
AND YOUR HAPPY LITTLE LIFE
AND LEAVE ME THE HELL ALONE?

08:43.854 --> 08:45.626
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:45.626 --> 08:50.030
I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

09:02.873 --> 09:05.716
(Lynette) SWEETIE, I'M HOME.

09:09.580 --> 09:11.021
HEY.

09:11.021 --> 09:12.152
HEY.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.154
DON'T MAKE PLANS ON TUESDAY.

09:14.154 --> 09:18.589
WE'RE HAVING DINNER
AT THE SOLIS' AND...

09:18.589 --> 09:20.591
WHAT'S THAT LOOK
ON YOUR FACE?

09:20.591 --> 09:23.063
YOU DIDN'T EAT DAIRY AGAIN,
DID YOU?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.795
NO. I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT.

09:24.795 --> 09:26.266
OH.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.269
IF YOU'RE GOOD,
I'LL LET YOU COP A FEEL.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.643
HMM. THAT'S OKAY.
I CAN SEE IT FROM HERE.

09:32.643 --> 09:33.874
THRILLING.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.946
PFFT.
 (chuckles)

09:35.946 --> 09:39.179
MWAH.
 (sniffs) YOU SMELL GOOD.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.151
MM. I JUST TOOK A SHOWER,

09:41.151 --> 09:44.154
AND I KNOW WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS...
 MM.

09:44.154 --> 09:47.117
BUT I AM EXHAUSTED.
 OH, COME ON, LYNETTE.
 PLEASE?

09:47.117 --> 09:49.620
OOH. WHINING--THAT'S HOT.

09:52.122 --> 09:54.695
FINE.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.027
LET'S HAVE SEX.

09:57.027 --> 09:59.369
BUT I WARN YOU,
I'M JUST GONNA LIE HERE,

09:59.369 --> 10:01.371
RESENTING YOU
THE WHOLE TIME,

10:01.371 --> 10:03.934
WAITING FOR THIS HELL
TO BE OVER.

10:03.934 --> 10:06.106
OKAY. IF YOU'RE SURE.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.808
TOM!
 MMM.

10:07.808 --> 10:12.042
COME ON!
 ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
OKAY, FORGET IT.

10:12.042 --> 10:13.914
(sighs)

10:13.914 --> 10:15.145
WAIT. Y--

10:15.145 --> 10:17.147
YOU JUST TOOK A SHOWER?
WHERE?

10:17.147 --> 10:19.019
AT WORK.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.021
DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD A SHOWER THERE.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.023
(shoes thud)
 I DON'T. CARLOS DOES.

10:25.355 --> 10:27.357
SO YOU WENT
INTO CARLOS' OFFICE,

10:27.357 --> 10:30.100
STRIPPED NAKED
AND TOOK A SHOWER?

10:30.100 --> 10:32.032
NO, I WENT
INTO CARLOS' BATHROOM,

10:32.032 --> 10:35.265
CLOSED THE DOOR, THEN STRIPPED
NAKED AND TOOK A SHOWER.

10:35.265 --> 10:38.008
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS.
WHAT IF HE WALKED IN?

10:38.008 --> 10:41.071
THEN MAYBE I'D GET THAT RAISE
I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR.
 THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

10:41.071 --> 10:44.014
YOU ALREADY SPEND 16 HOURS A DAY
WITH THE GUY,

10:44.014 --> 10:47.017
AND NOW I FIND OUT
THAT SOME OF THOSE HOURS,

10:47.017 --> 10:49.019
YOU ARE NAKED AND WET.
 HOURS? IT WAS TWO MINUTES.

10:49.019 --> 10:51.021
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M LIGHTING CANDLES

10:51.021 --> 10:54.224
AND PUTTING ON BARRY WHITE.
 I DON'T CARE.
I WANT IT TO STOP.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.058
FINE.

11:03.794 --> 11:07.738
I SHOULD'VE JUST HAD SEX.
I'D BE ASLEEP BY NOW.

11:11.371 --> 11:13.003
(scoffs)

11:14.374 --> 11:18.078
OH, AND, LADIES, WE HAVE BEEN
ASKED BY THE CITY COUNCIL

11:18.078 --> 11:20.380
TO BEAUTIFY THE CENTER DIVIDER
ON MAIN STREET.

11:20.380 --> 11:24.214
SO MAKE SURE YOUR CALENDARS
ARE CLEAR NEXT TUESDAY.

11:24.214 --> 11:26.917
(panting) I KNOW I'M NEW HERE
AT THE GARDEN CLUB,

11:26.917 --> 11:28.919
BUT WHAT'S
WITH ALL THE GARDENING?

11:28.919 --> 11:30.921
I THOUGHT
THIS WAS JUST AN EXCUSE

11:30.921 --> 11:34.424
TO GET TOGETHER
FOR BITCHIN' AND BOOZIN'.
 BLAME EDNA,
THE FLOWER FASCIST.

11:34.424 --> 11:36.266
YEAH, WHEN WE FIRST JOINED,

11:36.266 --> 11:38.268
WE USED TO SIT AROUND
IN WICKER CHAIRS,

11:38.268 --> 11:41.301
DRINKING MARGARITAS
AND JUST LOOKED AT THE FLOWERS.
 OH, I'D KILL FOR A MARGARITA.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.704
DON'T CLUSTER, LADIES.
VARY THE COLORS.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.476
AND SHE'S THE ONE I'D KILL.

11:46.476 --> 11:49.209
I MEAN, REALLY, WHO DIED
AND LEFT HER IN CHARGE?

11:49.209 --> 11:52.342
ALICE KOONTZ.
GRAND MAL SEIZURE WHILE DRIVING.

11:52.342 --> 11:54.084
OH.

11:55.786 --> 11:59.119
WELL, THIS EDNA
HAS GOT TO BE STOPPED.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.721
HOW?

12:01.721 --> 12:04.795
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE PLANNING
A COUP, AREN'T YOU? I'M IN.

12:04.795 --> 12:07.157
ME, TOO.

12:07.157 --> 12:09.900
WELL, THAT'S THREE.
WHO ELSE CAN WE GET?

12:11.461 --> 12:13.163
DEFINITELY JUDY.

12:13.163 --> 12:15.165
AND TERRY'S ALLERGIC
TO EVERYTHING.

12:15.165 --> 12:17.067
ONE BEE STING,
AND SHE BLOWS UP LIKE...

12:17.067 --> 12:18.869
WELL, LIKE, JUDY.

12:18.869 --> 12:20.871
HOW ABOUT
THE WOMAN IN THE OVERALLS?

12:20.871 --> 12:22.873
PHYLLIS? SHE JUST GOT
HER SECOND D.U.I.

12:22.873 --> 12:24.875
IF THERE'S COCKTAILS,
SHE'S IN.
 (mouths word)

12:24.875 --> 12:27.247
OKAY, SO THE LUSH
GIVES US SIX.

12:27.247 --> 12:31.151
WHAT ABOUT THEM?
 NO WAY. THEY'RE ALL FRIENDS
OF EDNA'S.

12:31.151 --> 12:34.154
MM.
 ALL RIGHT, SO THEY HAVE SIX,
AND WE HAVE SIX.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.957
WE'RE GONNA NEED A TIEBREAKER.

12:38.789 --> 12:40.891
(clicks tongue)

12:42.162 --> 12:45.535
HEY, UH, ARE MEN ALLOWED
TO JOIN THE GROUP?

12:45.535 --> 12:48.538
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY WOULDN'T BE.

12:48.538 --> 12:51.972
LADIES, START YOUR BLENDERS.

12:51.972 --> 12:55.145
ORSON, I HEARD
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

12:55.145 --> 12:57.177
YES, DR. KAGEN.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.210
I HEARD YOU'RE TREATING
A LADY ACROSS THE HALL.

13:00.210 --> 13:03.183
UH, YOU MEAN ROSE KEMPER?
 YEAH, SHE'S ACTUALLY
MY NEIGHBOR.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.256
I WANTED TO KNOW
HOW SHE'S DOING.
 SORRY. I CAN'T DISCUSS
HER CONDITION

13:06.256 --> 13:08.258
WITH ANYONE
SHE'S NOT RELATED TO.

13:08.258 --> 13:11.291
OH.
WELL, THAT'S A PROBLEM.

13:11.291 --> 13:15.225
SEE, SHE HAS NO FAMILY
OR FRIENDS, FOR THAT MATTER.

13:15.225 --> 13:18.068
AND, UH, BECAUSE OF
HER DEMENTIA...

13:18.068 --> 13:20.070
WHO SAID SHE HAS DEMENTIA?

13:20.070 --> 13:22.903
WELL, CERTAINLY YOU'VE HEARD
SOME OF HER BIZARRE RAMBLINGS.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.905
IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE
DEMENTIA,

13:24.905 --> 13:26.907
IT'S SOMETHING
JUST AS TROUBLING.

13:26.907 --> 13:30.240
SHE HAS BEEN SAYING
SOME VERY DISTURBING THINGS.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.512
BUT I WASN'T AWARE
IT WAS AN ONGOING SITUATION.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.145
OH, YES, IT IS.

13:35.145 --> 13:38.318
AND I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT HER
GOING BACK TO THAT BIG HOUSE

13:38.318 --> 13:40.590
WITH NO ONE
TO LOOK AFTER HER.

13:40.590 --> 13:43.854
HMM. I HATE TO GET
SOCIAL SERVICES INVOLVED.

13:43.854 --> 13:46.296
THEY'D PROBABLY JUST STICK HER
IN SOME STATE-RUN FACILITY.

13:46.296 --> 13:48.498
OH, THAT WOULD BE A SHAME.

13:48.498 --> 13:52.903
BUT WHAT IF SHE ENDS UP HURTING
HERSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE?

13:52.903 --> 13:54.905
I MEAN, I'M NO LAWYER,

13:54.905 --> 13:57.137
BUT WOULDN'T THE HOSPITAL
BE LIABLE?

14:11.882 --> 14:13.183
(turns engine off)

14:18.058 --> 14:21.131
HEY, PENNY. AREN'T YOU GONNA
BE LATE FOR SCHOOL?

14:21.131 --> 14:24.294
MY STUPID BROTHERS HID
MY HOMEWORK. REAL MATURE.

14:24.294 --> 14:26.136
(chuckles)
IS YOUR MOM READY?

14:26.136 --> 14:28.138
SHE'S IN THE SHOWER.

14:28.138 --> 14:29.569
WHAT?

14:32.242 --> 14:35.145
(knock on door)
 LYNETTE!

14:35.145 --> 14:39.179
(water running)
 CARLOS, YOU'RE EARLY!

14:39.179 --> 14:41.311
DIDN'T YOU GET MY TEXT?
THE MEETING GOT MOVED UP.

14:41.311 --> 14:43.613
OH, CRAP.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

14:43.613 --> 14:44.985
(soap thuds)

14:44.985 --> 14:46.356
(Lynette) AAH!
 (thud)

14:46.356 --> 14:48.658
LYNETTE, YOU OKAY?

14:48.658 --> 14:50.890
LYNETTE?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.322
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:52.322 --> 14:54.464
(water running)

14:54.464 --> 14:57.267
IF YOU DON'T ANSWER ME,
I'M COMING IN THERE.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.436
OH, MY GOD.

15:06.436 --> 15:09.279
ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR.
THANK YOU. BYE.

15:09.279 --> 15:11.911
HE SAYS THAT SINCE
YOU WEREN'T OUT VERY LONG,

15:11.911 --> 15:14.914
YOU SHOULD BE FINE. AND DON'T
WORRY ABOUT THE MEETING.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.488
I PUSHED IT TO LUNCH,
AND I CAN HANDLE IT ALONE.
 NO, I'M FINE. I-I WANT TO GO.

15:18.488 --> 15:20.290
YOU SURE?
 MM-HMM.

15:20.290 --> 15:22.192
OKAY,
I'LL LET YOU GET DRESSED.

15:22.192 --> 15:25.325
HEY, CARLOS,
QUICK QUESTION FOR YA.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.328
LAST THING I REMEMBER,
I WAS IN THE SHOWER, NAKED,

15:28.328 --> 15:29.929
REACHING FOR THE SOAP.

15:29.929 --> 15:35.565
THEN I WAS HERE ON THE BED,
UNDER A BLANKET...

15:35.565 --> 15:37.237
STILL NAKED.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.668
AND MY QUESTION IS,

15:38.668 --> 15:42.572
HOW DID I GET FROM THERE
TO HERE?

15:42.572 --> 15:44.714
WELL...

15:44.714 --> 15:46.216
I CARRIED YOU.

15:46.216 --> 15:47.447
UH-HUH.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.420
WHICH MEANS YOU SAW ME...

15:50.420 --> 15:53.583
(laughs) LYNETTE, THE ONLY THING
I WAS THINKING ABOUT

15:53.583 --> 15:56.126
WAS WERE YOU
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

15:56.126 --> 15:59.729
OH, WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT.
(laughs)

15:59.729 --> 16:02.032
AND HERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
I'D APPRECIATE--

16:02.032 --> 16:04.334
COULD WE NOT TELL ANYONE ELSE
ABOUT THIS?

16:04.334 --> 16:06.997
NOT TELL ANYONE?
I'M A FIRST-TIME HERO.

16:06.997 --> 16:10.040
THIS WAS GONNA BE MY LEAD ITEM
IN THIS YEAR'S CHRISTMAS LETTER.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.242
IF TOM FINDS OUT,
HE'LL FREAK.

16:12.242 --> 16:14.244
HE HAS THIS WEIRD THING

16:14.244 --> 16:17.347
ABOUT BEING THE ONLY GUY
WHO GETS TO SEE ME NAKED.

16:17.347 --> 16:22.282
YOU GOT IT. NOW GET DRESSED.
WE GOTTA GO.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.454
COULD YOU MAYBE
STEP OUTSIDE?

16:24.454 --> 16:26.556
I ONLY DO ONE SHOW A DAY.

16:26.556 --> 16:29.119
SORRY.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.063
(laughter)

16:33.063 --> 16:36.066
HERE YOU GO!

16:36.066 --> 16:37.267
(sighs)

16:37.267 --> 16:39.329
EDNA,
HERE'S YOUR DIET SODA.

16:39.329 --> 16:41.331
TRY TO KEEP YOUR PANTS ON.

16:41.331 --> 16:43.533
YOU KNOW, I DON'T MEAN
TO BE A KILLJOY,

16:43.533 --> 16:47.237
BUT ARE WE GONNA DO
ANY PLANTING TODAY?

16:47.237 --> 16:51.081
THERE'S SOME SEEDS IN THIS.
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

16:51.081 --> 16:53.613
(ice cubes rattle)

16:53.613 --> 16:56.516
(indistinct conversations)

16:56.516 --> 16:59.249
(speaking inaudibly)

16:59.249 --> 17:02.192
(scoffs)

17:02.192 --> 17:06.256
(sighs) PATTY, DO YOU MIND
IF I STEAL TOM FOR A SEC?

17:06.256 --> 17:08.358
OKAY, BUT ONLY A SEC.

17:08.358 --> 17:10.060
OKAY.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.561
WHAT'S UP?

17:12.561 --> 17:15.805
FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE
A REAL PRINCE FOR COMING TODAY.

17:15.805 --> 17:18.268
THANKS TO YOU,
OUR COUP IS COMPLETE.

17:18.268 --> 17:20.210
(chuckles) NO PROBLEM.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.612
ANYWAY, I KNOW
YOU MUST BE BORED SILLY,

17:22.612 --> 17:25.075
SO GO AHEAD
AND MAKE YOUR ESCAPE.

17:25.075 --> 17:27.077
ACTUALLY,
I'M THINKING OF STAYING.

17:27.077 --> 17:29.519
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME,
MEETING SOME NICE PEOPLE.

17:29.519 --> 17:33.323
YEAH, ABOUT THAT--
I GOTTA WARN YOU.

17:33.323 --> 17:35.625
PATTY'S KINDA GOT A THING
FOR MARRIED MEN.

17:35.625 --> 17:38.688
OH, PATTY? NO! NO, NO.
SHE'S JUST BEING NICE.

17:38.688 --> 17:42.332
YES, SHE'S LIKE THAT. SHE'LL
GIVE YOU THE BRA OFF HER BACK.

17:42.332 --> 17:44.634
WE'RE JUST TALKIN'.

17:44.634 --> 17:48.598
"OH, TOM,
WHAT BIG ARMS YOU HAVE"--

17:48.598 --> 17:50.240
THAT KIND OF TALKIN'?

17:50.240 --> 17:52.372
OH, THAT. OKAY, FINE.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.204
FINE. POINT TAKEN.

17:54.204 --> 17:56.476
OKAY, GREAT.
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

17:56.476 --> 17:58.748
I HAVE TO GET BACK
TO MY GARDENING.

17:58.748 --> 18:01.551
(whirring)

18:03.213 --> 18:06.556
SO ORSON'S DECIDED
TO BE HAPPY.

18:06.556 --> 18:08.258
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

18:08.258 --> 18:11.221
HE SOUNDED VERY SINCERE.

18:11.221 --> 18:12.692
I'LL BET.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.365
SO JUST HOW HAPPY
IS HE GOING TO BE?

18:15.365 --> 18:17.197
WILL HE WHISTLE
WHILE HE WORKS,

18:17.197 --> 18:19.829
OR WILL HE JUST SKIP AROUND
THE HOUSE OCCASIONALLY?

18:19.829 --> 18:21.701
I DID NOT RAISE YOU
TO BE BITCHY.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.604
(chuckles) NO, YOU RAISED ME
TO BE PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.606
MY BITCHINESS--
THAT WAS SELF-TAUGHT.

18:26.606 --> 18:30.310
WELL, SAVE IT FOR THOSE KARAOKE
PARTIES AT BOB AND LEE'S.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.212
I AM NOT AMUSED.

18:32.212 --> 18:35.215
(sets glass down)
 MOM, YOUR B.S. METER
MIGHT BE BROKEN,

18:35.215 --> 18:37.287
BUT MINE WORKS JUST FINE.

18:37.287 --> 18:38.648
ORSON'S UP TO SOMETHING.

18:38.648 --> 18:42.352
WELL, I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'RE A BIT CYNICAL,

18:42.352 --> 18:44.354
BUT I'M GIVING HIM
ANOTHER CHANCE.

18:44.354 --> 18:46.326
HE'S MY HUSBAND,
AND I STILL LOVE HIM.

18:48.598 --> 18:51.361
HE'S BEEN STEALING STUFF
FROM YOUR FRIENDS.

18:51.361 --> 18:53.833
HE TRIED TO GET YOU
TO SELL YOUR BUSINESS.

18:53.833 --> 18:57.237
I KNOW.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.708
FINE.

18:58.708 --> 19:00.770
GO AHEAD. TAKE HIM BACK.

19:00.770 --> 19:04.143
BUT WHILE YOU'RE WATCHING ORSON
SKIP AND SING,

19:04.143 --> 19:07.277
I'LL BE LOOKING UP
DIVORCE LAWYERS, JUST IN CASE.

19:13.923 --> 19:15.425
SUSAN, YOU HERE?

19:15.425 --> 19:17.327
(Susan) IN THE KITCHEN.

19:19.229 --> 19:21.531
(sighs)

19:21.531 --> 19:23.733
WHY ARE YOU
MOPPING THE CEILING?

19:23.733 --> 19:26.566
I WAS COOKING, ALL RIGHT?

19:26.566 --> 19:28.198
LIDS.

19:28.198 --> 19:30.870
SUSAN, YOU REALLY
GOTTA START USING LIDS.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.903
SOMETIMES
IT'S THE STOVE'S FAULT.

19:33.903 --> 19:36.406
SO I, UH,
SAW DAVE LAST NIGHT.

19:36.406 --> 19:37.747
(water running)
 HOW'D THAT GO?

19:37.747 --> 19:39.749
NOT GOOD.
HE'S IN A REALLY DARK PLACE.

19:39.749 --> 19:42.382
HE KINDA LASHED OUT AT ME.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.315
AT YOU? WHY?

19:45.315 --> 19:47.617
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN,

19:47.617 --> 19:49.789
HE RESENTS MY HAPPINESS
WITH KATHERINE.

19:49.789 --> 19:53.293
THAT'S WEIRD.
 MAYBE NOT.
WHEN YOUR WIFE DIES,

19:53.293 --> 19:54.794
IT MUST BE DEPRESSING

19:54.794 --> 19:56.866
TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE
IN A LOVING RELATIONSHIP.

19:56.866 --> 20:00.370
HEY, MAYBE YOU COULD
LOOK IN ON HIM.

20:01.631 --> 20:04.334
YEAH, YEAH,
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

20:04.334 --> 20:06.836
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.

20:06.836 --> 20:09.339
I'LL STOP BY TOMORROW
AND SEE HIM.

20:09.339 --> 20:10.240
THANKS.

20:12.482 --> 20:15.385
YOU KNOW,
THIS WHOLE THING WITH EDIE...

20:15.385 --> 20:18.388
I MEAN, SEEING HER LYING
IN THE STREET THAT NIGHT...

20:20.620 --> 20:22.622
OH, IT JUST BROUGHT UP

20:22.622 --> 20:25.495
ALL THOSE AWFUL MEMORIES
FROM OUR ACCIDENT.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.599
SUSAN.

20:31.361 --> 20:33.403
WE DID WHAT WE HAD TO DO.

20:33.403 --> 20:36.336
YEAH.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.767
(sighs)

20:37.767 --> 20:40.270
LOOK WHAT IT DID TO US.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.445
DADDY!

20:45.445 --> 20:47.377
HEY, BUDDY.

20:47.377 --> 20:48.818
HEY, YOU HUNGRY?

20:48.818 --> 20:51.421
NO. MOMMY MADE SPAGHETTI.

20:51.421 --> 20:54.454
(laughs)

20:54.454 --> 20:57.757
ALL RIGHT, I'LL, UH, I'LL HAVE
HIM BACK BEFORE SCHOOL.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.395
YOU TAKE CARE.

21:05.395 --> 21:07.497
YOU, TOO.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.743
(sighs)

21:23.913 --> 21:25.915
HEY. I'M ON MY WAY TO WORK,

21:25.915 --> 21:28.388
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO BRING YOU THESE.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.890
UH, CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICHES,
WHICH I DID NOT MAKE.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.423
I BOUGHT. I LEARNED MY LESSON
FROM THE CASSEROLE.

21:35.064 --> 21:36.896
UH, THANKS.
(clears throat)

21:36.896 --> 21:38.368
UH, WAIT.

21:38.368 --> 21:41.831
COULD YOU MAYBE
HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW

21:41.831 --> 21:45.435
SO THAT I KNOW THAT YOU
ACTUALLY ATE SOMETHING?

21:45.435 --> 21:48.307
I'M NOT HUNGRY,
BUT AGAIN, THANKS.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.511
DAVE, I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH HELL,

21:51.511 --> 21:55.044
BUT EDIE WAS MY FRIEND,
SO PLEASE, LET ME HELP YOU.

21:55.044 --> 21:57.387
JUST A LITTLE.

22:12.632 --> 22:16.806
(mouth full) YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ONE? IT'S REALLY GOOD.

22:16.806 --> 22:19.068
STILL NOT HUNGRY.

22:22.742 --> 22:26.115
SO... HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO NOW?

22:26.115 --> 22:28.618
I'M GONNA SELL THE HOUSE.

22:28.618 --> 22:30.780
YOU'RE KIDDING. SO SOON?

22:30.780 --> 22:33.082
I'VE GOT A REALTOR
COMING BY TODAY.

22:33.082 --> 22:36.085
I'M GONNA PUT THE MONEY
IN A TRUST FOR TRAVERS.

22:36.085 --> 22:38.488
IT'S, UH, IT'S WHAT EDIE
WOULD HAVE WANTED.

22:38.488 --> 22:40.359
(sighs)

22:40.359 --> 22:42.532
OKAY, WELL...

22:42.532 --> 22:44.594
(sighs)

22:44.594 --> 22:47.897
AT LEAST YOU'RE MAKING PLANS
FOR THE FUTURE.

22:47.897 --> 22:52.071
EVERYTHING THAT EVER MATTERED
TO ME IS GONE.

22:52.071 --> 22:56.105
THE FUTURE'S THE LAST THING
I'M THINKING ABOUT.

22:58.648 --> 23:00.750
UH, WELL, I SHOULD

23:00.750 --> 23:03.583
PROBABLY... PUT THESE AWAY

23:03.583 --> 23:07.457
BEFORE I FINISH THEM OFF.

23:09.118 --> 23:13.122
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP YOU?

23:13.122 --> 23:15.164
A LOAD OF LAUNDRY?

23:15.164 --> 23:17.467
NO, THANKS.

23:17.467 --> 23:19.469
HOW ABOUT A POT OF COFFEE?

23:19.469 --> 23:21.931
OR I COULD JUST...

23:21.931 --> 23:24.073
STRAIGHTEN UP IN HERE?

23:24.073 --> 23:27.477
SUSAN, PLEASE.
I NEED TO BE ALONE.

23:33.743 --> 23:35.114
OH.

23:35.114 --> 23:38.448
UH... OKAY.

23:41.491 --> 23:43.122
SURE.

23:52.762 --> 23:57.206
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS
A GREAT CURE FOR THE BLUES?

23:57.206 --> 23:59.469
CRIBBAGE.

23:59.469 --> 24:01.571
DO YOU HAVE A CRIBBAGE SET?

24:01.571 --> 24:04.143
I THOUGHT
YOU HAD TO GO TO WORK.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.516
I'LL CALL IN SICK,
TAKE THE DAY OFF.

24:06.516 --> 24:09.519
SUSAN...

24:09.519 --> 24:12.882
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE RUDE,
BUT YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

24:15.525 --> 24:16.886
OKAY.

24:16.886 --> 24:19.529
YOU HAVE A REALTOR COMING,
RIGHT?

24:19.529 --> 24:22.592
YOU CANNOT LET HIM SEE THE HOUSE
IN THIS CONDITION.

24:22.592 --> 24:26.536
SO JUST LET ME
CLEAN UP A LITTLE.

24:26.536 --> 24:28.738
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW I'M HERE.

24:58.227 --> 25:00.730
ALL RIGHT.

25:00.730 --> 25:05.605
I WILL BE BACK AFTER WORK
TO CHECK ON YOU.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.236
BUT UNTIL THEN,

25:07.236 --> 25:11.210
HERE'S THE PHONE,
IN CASE YOU WANNA ORDER CHINESE

25:11.210 --> 25:13.743
OR...

25:13.743 --> 25:16.515
CALL A HOTLINE
OR SOMETHING.

25:21.991 --> 25:24.994
(grunts)

25:24.994 --> 25:27.526
(door closes)

25:27.526 --> 25:30.529
HEY, KATHERINE, CAN YOU CALL ME
BACK AS SOON AS YOU CAN?

25:30.529 --> 25:33.232
I JUST LEFT DAVE,
AND HE'S IN BAD SHAPE.
 (siren wailing)

25:33.232 --> 25:35.234
I ACTUALLY THINK
THAT HE MIGHT BE--

25:35.234 --> 25:38.007
OH, CRAP. I GOTTA GO.

25:38.007 --> 25:39.008
(beep)

25:39.008 --> 25:41.240
(car door closes)

25:43.142 --> 25:45.314
YES, OFFICER?
 LICENSE AND REGISTRATION,
PLEASE.

25:45.314 --> 25:47.677
OH, OKAY.
UH, WHAT DID I DO?

25:47.677 --> 25:50.179
IT'S AGAINST THE LAW
TO TALK ON A CELL PHONE

25:50.179 --> 25:52.551
WITHOUT USING A HANDS-FREE
DEVICE WHILE DRIVING,

25:52.551 --> 25:54.053
AS OF JANUARY 1st.

25:54.053 --> 25:58.087
RIGHT. I KNOW THAT. I JUST
WAS WORRIED ABOUT A FRIEND,

25:58.087 --> 26:00.089
SO I FORGOT. I'M SORRY.

26:00.089 --> 26:02.592
STEP OUT OF THE CAR SLOWLY.

26:02.592 --> 26:05.094
UH, WHAT? YOU DON'T WANT
THE LICENSE?
 OUT OF THE CAR.

26:07.196 --> 26:08.337
OH!

26:08.337 --> 26:11.000
(laughs) YOU THINK
THAT I'M DANGEROUS.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.573
NO, I TOTALLY HAVE
AN EXPLANATION FOR THOSE.
 STOP TALKING.

26:14.573 --> 26:18.247
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL REALLY SILLY
WHEN YOU HEAR WHAT IT IS.
 GET OUT OF THE CAR NOW!

26:18.247 --> 26:20.109
OKAY.

26:20.109 --> 26:23.212
ON THE GROUND!
 OH, YES, SIR!

26:23.212 --> 26:26.616
HEY, SUSAN. I JUST GOT
YOUR MESSAGE ABOUT DAVE.

26:26.616 --> 26:31.320
I'M ON MY WAY TO THE HOSPITAL,
BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO, I...

26:31.320 --> 26:35.925
YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T WE TALK LATER?

26:50.209 --> 26:52.081
HEY, TOM.

26:52.081 --> 26:53.783
HEY.

26:53.783 --> 26:55.614
WAS THAT PATTY RIZZO?

26:55.614 --> 26:58.617
YEAH. I HAD SOME CAR TROUBLE,
SO SHE FOLLOWED ME

26:58.617 --> 27:01.721
OVER TO THE GARAGE
AND GAVE ME A LIFT BACK.

27:01.721 --> 27:04.724
PATTY LIVES SIX BLOCKS AWAY.
I LIVE DOWN THE STREET.

27:04.724 --> 27:07.356
WHY DIDN'T YOU
ASK ME TO TAKE YOU?

27:07.356 --> 27:09.328
ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE
WITH THIS?

27:09.328 --> 27:12.331
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, TOM, I'M SORRY,
BUT I GOT A RESPONSIBILITY HERE.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.333
I BROUGHT YOU INTO THE CLUB.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.837
I INTRODUCED YOU
TO THE HORNY HOMEMAKER.

27:17.837 --> 27:22.171
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO...
 WHAT, GABY,
CHEAT ON MY WIFE?

27:22.171 --> 27:24.173
I WAS GONNA SAY
"DIE OF GONORRHEA,"

27:24.173 --> 27:25.875
BUT THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

27:25.875 --> 27:29.278
OKAY, UM, I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN,

27:29.278 --> 27:32.221
BUT HOW CAN I PUT THIS?

27:32.221 --> 27:33.352
BUTT OUT.

27:33.352 --> 27:36.055
ALL RIGHT, TOM,
YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.227
YOU ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED
TO SEE PATTY.

27:38.227 --> 27:41.260
"ALLOWED"?
WHO ARE YOU, MY MOTHER?

27:41.260 --> 27:44.734
I TRUMP YOUR MOTHER.
I AM GARDEN CLUB PRESIDENT.

27:44.734 --> 27:46.996
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

27:46.996 --> 27:49.999
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND.
 LOOK, I LOVE YOU, TOM,

27:49.999 --> 27:52.101
BUT YOU'RE MY FRIEND
WITH A SMALL "F."

27:52.101 --> 27:54.974
MY FRIEND WITH THE BIG "F"
IS LYNETTE.

27:54.974 --> 27:57.777
SO IF I SEE SOMETHING
THAT COULD HURT HER,

27:57.777 --> 28:02.281
YOU BET YOUR ASS I'M GONNA
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
 A NEIGHBOR
OFFERED ME A RIDE.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.283
IF YOU WANT TO HURT LYNETTE

28:04.283 --> 28:07.857
AND TWIST IT INTO SOMETHING
THAT IT ISN'T, SCREW YOU.

28:07.857 --> 28:11.160
AND THAT'S WITH A BIG "F."

28:11.160 --> 28:14.263
(scoffs)
 (door opens and closes)

28:14.263 --> 28:16.465
HELLO, MY LOVE.

28:16.465 --> 28:19.799
OH, HELLO, DARLING. PLEASE TELL
ME YOU'RE HERE TO SPRING ME.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.700
NOT THAT I HAVEN'T ENJOYED
EVERY MOMENT

28:21.700 --> 28:25.805
OF YOUR POKING AND PRODDING.
 I'M JUST TAKING ONE LAST LOOK
AT YOUR HUSBAND.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.337
ARE YOU SURE HE WASN'T
IN SOME SORT OF BAR FIGHT?

28:28.337 --> 28:30.479
IT LOOKS LIKE HE GOT
SMACKED OVER THE HEAD

28:30.479 --> 28:33.482
WITH A POOL CUE OR SOMETHING.
 ORSON'S NOT EXACTLY
THE BAR-FIGHT TYPE.

28:33.482 --> 28:37.386
HE'S MORE OF A RAISED-VOICES-
AT-A-CHEESE-TASTING TYPE.
 WHILE I'M FINISHING UP HERE,

28:37.386 --> 28:39.849
DO YOU WANNA GO SIGN
THE DISCHARGE PAPERS?

28:39.849 --> 28:42.421
GREAT. BE BACK IN A MINUTE.
(blows kiss)

28:46.756 --> 28:48.497
BREE?

28:48.497 --> 28:50.960
KATHERINE. HI.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

28:50.960 --> 28:53.132
OH, I CAME
TO SEE ROSE KEMPER.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.104
OH, RIGHT.
I HEARD SHE WAS HERE.

28:55.104 --> 28:57.406
YEAH, IT'S SO SAD.
I'M HERE TO HELP HER PACK.

28:57.406 --> 28:59.408
SOCIAL SERVICES IS COMING
THIS AFTERNOON

28:59.408 --> 29:02.411
TO TAKE HER
TO SOME NURSING HOME.
 I'M SURPRISED.
I KNEW SHE WAS A BIT DOTTY,

29:02.411 --> 29:06.776
BUT DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS THAT SERIOUS.
 OH, YES. SHE'S BEEN
TELLING PEOPLE THIS STORY

29:06.776 --> 29:09.348
ABOUT HOW DEATH
BROKE INTO HER HOUSE.

29:09.348 --> 29:10.319
DEATH?
 MM-HMM.

29:10.319 --> 29:11.350
OH, DEAR.

29:11.350 --> 29:14.153
APPARENTLY HE CLIMBED IN
THROUGH A WINDOW

29:14.153 --> 29:16.786
AND THEN TRIED TO STEAL
ONE OF HER KNICKKNACKS.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.429
(gasps) WELL, THAT'S ODD.

29:20.429 --> 29:23.132
YEAH. THEN SHE WHACKED HIM
ACROSS THE HEAD

29:23.132 --> 29:24.433
WITH A BASEBALL BAT.

29:24.433 --> 29:26.435
A BAT?

29:26.435 --> 29:28.437
WHICH IS WHAT I WOULD DO

29:28.437 --> 29:31.300
IF DEATH WERE EVER TO STEAL
ONE OF MY KNICKKNACKS.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.243
(chuckles) SO DID SHE GET
A GOOD LOOK AT... DEATH?

29:34.243 --> 29:37.406
NO. SHE SAID HE WAS WEARING
SOME SORT OF MASK.

29:37.406 --> 29:39.809
SHE TELLS THE STORY
SO CONVINCINGLY,

29:39.809 --> 29:42.551
YOU ALMOST BELIEVE HER.
 (chuckles nervously)

29:42.551 --> 29:44.954
OH,
THERE'S THE SOCIAL WORKER.

29:44.954 --> 29:47.857
I WANNA BE THERE
WHEN SHE TALKS TO ROSE.

29:47.857 --> 29:52.321
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

29:52.321 --> 29:54.493
HE'S ALL YOURS, BREE.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.495
WONDERFUL.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.211
MMM!
THIS DINNER IS DELICIOUS.

30:12.211 --> 30:15.214
YOU REALLY DIDN'T HAVE
TO DO THIS.
 WITH THE LONG HOURS
YOU'VE BEEN PUTTING IN,

30:15.214 --> 30:18.447
I JUST WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
SPECIAL TO SAY THANK YOU.
 AND BY "DO SOMETHING,"

30:18.447 --> 30:22.091
HE MEANS HAVING ME SLAVE
OVER A RACK OF LAMB ALL DAY.
 (Lynette laughs)

30:22.091 --> 30:24.093
I WOULD LIKE
TO PROPOSE A TOAST.

30:24.093 --> 30:26.225
WHO SAYS THAT FRIENDSHIP
AND BUSINESS DON'T MIX?

30:26.225 --> 30:29.258
(Carlos) TO FRIENDSHIP.
 HEAR, HEAR. TO FRIENDSHIP.

30:29.258 --> 30:31.060
(glasses clink)

30:31.060 --> 30:34.333
SO I WANT TO HEAR MORE
ABOUT THE GARDEN CLUB.

30:34.333 --> 30:37.136
TOM SAYS HE'S MEETING
ALL KINDS OF NICE PEOPLE.

30:37.136 --> 30:39.168
REALLY?

30:39.168 --> 30:40.609
ANY FAVORITES, TOM?

30:40.609 --> 30:42.511
THEY'RE ALL GREAT GALS.

30:42.511 --> 30:44.513
ONE'S SORT OF A PAIN IN THE ASS.

30:44.513 --> 30:47.376
OTHER THAN HER,
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME.

30:47.376 --> 30:51.420
ALTHOUGH I KEEP TELLING TOM
HOW DANGEROUS GARDENS CAN BE.

30:51.420 --> 30:53.122
EVERYWHERE YOU STEP,

30:53.122 --> 30:56.886
THERE ARE SHOVELS
AND RAKES AND HOES.

31:01.490 --> 31:05.134
YOU KNOW, LYNETTE AND I SHOULD
REALLY BE TOASTING YOU TWO.

31:05.134 --> 31:06.565
MM.
 US?

31:06.565 --> 31:08.267
YEAH, FOR PUTTING UP

31:08.267 --> 31:10.339
WITH ALL THE LONG HOURS
WE'VE BEEN KEEPING.

31:10.339 --> 31:13.372
HEY, I DIDN'T MIND
THE LONG HOURS. (chuckles)

31:13.372 --> 31:17.306
I WASN'T SO CRAZY ABOUT
THE WHOLE SHOWER THING, BUT...
 OH, SO LYNETTE
TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT?

31:17.306 --> 31:20.549
YEAH, SHE THOUGHT I WAS NUTS
FOR GETTING WEIRD ABOUT IT.

31:20.549 --> 31:22.251
I GET IT.

31:22.251 --> 31:25.184
A GUY CARRIES YOUR UNCONSCIOUS,
NAKED WIFE TO YOUR BED...

31:25.184 --> 31:27.987
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:31.520 --> 31:34.393
HEY, IS THIS GORGONZOLA?

31:34.393 --> 31:36.665
THE OTHER DAY
WHEN SHE FELL IN YOUR SHOWER.

31:36.665 --> 31:40.029
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 WHEN SHE TOOK A SHOWER
IN YOUR OFFICE.

31:40.029 --> 31:43.032
YOU TOOK A SHOWER
IN MY OFFICE?
 WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

31:43.032 --> 31:44.673
LYNETTE WAS TAKING A SHOWER

31:44.673 --> 31:47.336
AND CARLOS CAME BY
TO DRIVE HER TO WORK.

31:47.336 --> 31:51.310
SHE SLIPPED AND FELL,
AND HE HELPED HER.
 YOU TOLD HER?
I ASKED YOU NOT TO.

31:51.310 --> 31:54.313
SHE'S MY WIFE.
I TELL HER EVERYTHING.
 OH, YOU HEAR THAT, LYNETTE?
THEY TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

31:54.313 --> 31:57.346
THAT WAY THEY KNOW THAT
THEY'RE NOT HIDING ANYTHING.
 I WAS JUST AFRAID
YOU'D OVERREACT,

31:57.346 --> 32:01.150
LIKE YOU'RE DOING...
(whispers) RIGHT NOW.
 FULL DISCLOSURE, LYNETTE--
THAT'S WHAT A MARRIAGE IS ABOUT.

32:01.150 --> 32:03.222
SO I ASSUME YOU FULLY DISCLOSED

32:03.222 --> 32:05.394
YOUR LITTLE "FRIENDSHIP"
WITH PATTY RIZZO.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.600
WHAT LITTLE FRIENDSHIP?

32:11.600 --> 32:14.403
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK THIS IS GORGONZOLA.

32:14.403 --> 32:15.965
TOM?

32:15.965 --> 32:17.967
WELL,
PATTY GAVE ME A RIDE HOME,

32:17.967 --> 32:20.369
AND FOR SOME REASON, GABY'S
MAKING A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT.

32:20.369 --> 32:23.312
BECAUSE IT'S PATTY RIZZO.
SHE'S A TOTAL SLUT.

32:23.312 --> 32:26.645
YOU SHOULD BE ON ANTIBIOTICS
JUST FOR SITTING IN HER CAR.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.047
EXACTLY.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.579
STAY OUT OF THIS, GABY.
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE.

32:30.579 --> 32:32.721
HEY, DON'T SNAP AT ME.
LYNETTE'S MY FRIEND.

32:32.721 --> 32:36.255
I WAS JUST WATCHING HER BACK.
 WHILE YOUR HUSBAND
WAS WATCHING HER FRONT.

32:36.255 --> 32:37.556
DROP IT, TOM.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.389
WE'LL CONTINUE THIS AT HOME.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.167
IF YOU HAVE A SHOWER
AT THE OFFICE,

32:48.167 --> 32:51.100
HOW COME YOU COME HOME
SMELLING SO BAD?

32:51.100 --> 32:52.501
I DON'T KNOW.

32:52.501 --> 32:55.204
WHY DOES THE LAMB
TASTE LIKE SAWDUST?

32:58.407 --> 33:02.151
OH, THANK YOU, DARLING.

33:02.151 --> 33:05.284
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW NICE IT IS
TO BE HOME AGAIN.

33:05.284 --> 33:08.387
WELL, IT'S WONDERFUL
TO HAVE YOU HOME.

33:08.387 --> 33:10.089
HOW'S YOUR HEAD?

33:10.089 --> 33:12.361
MM, IT STILL HURTS.

33:12.361 --> 33:14.063
WELL, THAT'LL TEACH YOU

33:14.063 --> 33:17.066
TO GO OUT WALKING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
 (chuckles)

33:17.066 --> 33:20.369
YOU KNOW, I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU WERE OUT SO LATE.

33:20.369 --> 33:22.631
WELL, I TOLD YOU.

33:22.631 --> 33:26.675
WE HAD A LITTLE SPAT,
AND I WANTED TO CLEAR MY HEAD.

33:26.675 --> 33:31.080
OH. AND THEN YOU BUMPED IT
ON THAT NASTY CURB.

33:31.080 --> 33:34.413
WELL, THAT'LL TEACH ME
TO FIGHT WITH MY LOVELY WIFE.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.115
HMM.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.117
AND THAT'S ALL
YOU WERE DOING,

33:38.117 --> 33:40.149
JUST GOING OUT FOR A WALK?

33:41.450 --> 33:43.292
THAT'S ALL.

33:49.498 --> 33:51.500
OH, YOU KNOW,
I JUST REMEMBERED

33:51.500 --> 33:54.363
SOME BUSINESS
I HAVE TO DISCUSS WITH ANDREW.
 MM.

33:54.363 --> 33:56.365
ENJOY YOUR TEA.

34:01.610 --> 34:04.313
HEY, MOM. WHAT'S WRONG?

34:04.313 --> 34:09.148
ORSON'S LYING TO ME AGAIN.

34:09.148 --> 34:12.081
SO I THINK
I HAVE TO DIVORCE HIM.

34:14.083 --> 34:17.456
JUST, UH, TELL ME
HOW I CAN HELP.

34:27.366 --> 34:30.399
YOU OKAY?

34:30.399 --> 34:33.502
I JUST KEEP THINKING
ABOUT DAVE.

34:33.502 --> 34:35.504
HIS LIFE WAS SO GREAT.

34:35.504 --> 34:37.106
HE HAD EVERYTHING.

34:37.106 --> 34:40.478
THEN ONE DAY, BOOM!
ALL GONE.

34:40.478 --> 34:44.553
YEAH, I KNOW.

34:44.553 --> 34:47.416
LIFE CAN TURN ON A DIME--

34:47.416 --> 34:50.559
DAVE, EDIE,

34:50.559 --> 34:53.722
ROSE KEMPER...

34:53.722 --> 34:57.566
THE ONE THING
IT'S MADE ME REALIZE IS...

34:57.566 --> 34:59.628
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
WITH REGRETS.

34:59.628 --> 35:02.831
ME NEITHER.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.477
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO TELL YOU
THIS FOR SOME TIME.

35:08.477 --> 35:12.841
REMEMBER WHEN I SUGGESTED
MOVING IN TOGETHER?

35:12.841 --> 35:16.185
IT WASN'T
JUST ABOUT SAVING RENT.

35:16.185 --> 35:20.289
I WAS TRYING
TO PULL YOU CLOSER,

35:20.289 --> 35:23.692
MANIPULATE SOME KIND
OF COMMITMENT OUT OF YOU.

35:23.692 --> 35:26.795
AND THAT'S NOT WHO I AM, SO I
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M SORRY,

35:26.795 --> 35:29.158
AND IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

35:29.158 --> 35:33.332
FROM NOW ON,
NO HIDDEN AGENDAS.

35:35.604 --> 35:37.536
I LIKE THAT POLICY.

35:39.137 --> 35:42.341
I'M ALWAYS GONNA BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

35:43.872 --> 35:45.544
AFTER ALL,

35:45.544 --> 35:48.517
YOU'RE THE GUY I'M GONNA SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH.

35:54.183 --> 35:56.285
(doorbell rings)

35:57.856 --> 36:00.489
AH, MORE SANDWICHES.

36:00.489 --> 36:02.461
OR IS MY GUN IN THERE?

36:02.461 --> 36:04.863
(sighs) IT'S JUST
YOUR BELTS AND TIES.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.865
THE POLICE KEPT THE REST.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.638
I KNOW. THEY CALLED.

36:09.638 --> 36:11.770
YOU TOLD THEM
I WAS SUICIDAL.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.442
I'M SORRY.

36:13.442 --> 36:16.505
IT'S JUST--
THE THINGS YOU SAID...

36:16.505 --> 36:18.507
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

36:18.507 --> 36:19.808
DON'T BE.

36:19.808 --> 36:22.381
I TOLD YOU, I'M FINE.

36:26.415 --> 36:27.716
YOU ARE NOT FINE.

36:27.716 --> 36:29.888
(door closes)
 HOW COULD YOU BE?

36:29.888 --> 36:32.721
YOU HAVE SUFFERED
A HORRIBLE LOSS.

36:32.721 --> 36:36.295
AND YOU ARE ALLOWED
TO FEEL ANY WAY YOU WANT.

36:36.295 --> 36:39.568
BUT I KNOW
THAT YOU ARE NOT FINE.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.374
(sighs)

36:45.374 --> 36:49.538
OKAY, WELL, I'M SORRY
FOR RANSACKING YOUR HOUSE.

36:49.538 --> 36:52.581
I'LL STOP BUGGING YOU.

36:54.813 --> 36:58.287
EDIE AND I HAD A FIGHT.

36:58.287 --> 37:01.290
THAT NIGHT.

37:01.290 --> 37:02.951
A BAD ONE.

37:09.298 --> 37:10.929
I CAME HOME.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.462
WE ARGUED.

37:13.462 --> 37:16.335
SHE STORMED OUT,
GOT IN HER CAR AND DIED.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.938
OH, DAVE...

37:25.274 --> 37:27.576
THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT
YOUR FAULT.

37:27.576 --> 37:29.678
DOESN'T IT?

37:29.678 --> 37:32.981
IF THINGS HAD BEEN DIFFERENT,
IF I...

37:32.981 --> 37:35.524
HAD BEEN DIFFERENT,
SHE'D STILL BE ALIVE.

37:35.524 --> 37:37.526
YOU CAN'T THINK THAT WAY.

37:37.526 --> 37:39.528
I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENED
IS BAD ENOUGH.

37:39.528 --> 37:42.260
Y-YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF
FOR IT, TOO.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.732
IF YOU DO THAT,

37:43.732 --> 37:46.795
YOU WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING
YOU HAVE LEFT THAT'S GOOD.

37:46.795 --> 37:49.498
TRUST ME. I KNOW.

37:49.498 --> 37:53.372
TRUST ME. YOU DON'T.

37:56.505 --> 38:00.609
A FEW YEARS AGO, MIKE AND I
GOT IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

38:02.451 --> 38:06.455
A WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER...
DIED.

38:07.756 --> 38:10.288
YEAH, I-I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
 (liquid pouring)

38:11.790 --> 38:13.992
MIKE WAS DRIVING, RIGHT?
 (sets bottle down)

38:16.795 --> 38:18.767
THAT'S WHAT WE SAID...

38:20.799 --> 38:23.472
BUT IT WASN'T TRUE.

38:26.335 --> 38:30.909
AFTER THE CRASH,

38:30.909 --> 38:32.911
I COULDN'T FIND MY LICENSE.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.913
I HAD SWITCHED PURSES
THAT NIGHT,

38:34.913 --> 38:37.916
AND I HAD LEFT IT AT HOME,
AND SO...

38:37.916 --> 38:42.090
MIKE... TOLD THEM
THAT HE WAS DRIVING.

38:42.090 --> 38:45.494
HE TOOK THE BLAME FOR ME.

38:45.494 --> 38:46.925
SO...

38:46.925 --> 38:49.628
I UNDERSTAND GUILT.

38:49.628 --> 38:53.031
AND I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND

38:53.031 --> 38:57.566
THAT EDIE'S DEATH WAS
AN AWFUL TRAGEDY.

38:57.566 --> 38:59.508
IT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.

39:03.612 --> 39:05.444
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.646
THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.696
HECK OF A DINNER PARTY, HUH?

39:27.696 --> 39:31.540
IT'S AMAZING HOW FAST
YOU CAN EAT IN TOTAL SILENCE.

39:31.540 --> 39:34.543
IT'S MY FAULT. I SHOULD HAVE
JUST TOLD TOM THE TRUTH,

39:34.543 --> 39:36.875
ALTHOUGH IT TURNED OUT
TO BE KIND OF A WASH

39:36.875 --> 39:38.907
WITH THE WHOLE PATTY RIZZO
THING.

39:38.907 --> 39:41.149
YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK IS COOL?

39:41.149 --> 39:43.552
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN MARRIED
A LONG TIME,

39:43.552 --> 39:45.554
AND YOU STILL GET JEALOUS.

39:45.554 --> 39:49.017
YEAH. BUT JUST TO BE
ON THE SAFE SIDE,

39:49.017 --> 39:52.521
IF I FALL IN MY TUB AGAIN,
LET ME DIE THERE.

39:52.521 --> 39:54.763
OKAY. BACK TO WORK.

39:54.763 --> 39:57.766
YES. AND WE SHALL NEVER
SPEAK OF THIS AGAIN.

39:57.766 --> 40:00.098
I AM EMBARRASSED ENOUGH.

40:00.098 --> 40:02.901
LYNETTE?

40:02.901 --> 40:05.804
I SAW YOU
WITHOUT YOUR TOWEL.

40:05.804 --> 40:10.138
YOU GOT NOTHING
TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

40:18.517 --> 40:19.718
HEY.

40:19.718 --> 40:21.550
HEY.

40:23.752 --> 40:26.525
HOW'S THE GARDEN CLUB TODAY?

40:26.525 --> 40:29.658
OH, PHYLLIS GOT TANKED ON COSMOS
AND THREW UP ON EDNA...

40:29.658 --> 40:32.731
(chuckles)
 SO NOW WE'RE BACK
TO PLANTING CRAP.

40:34.733 --> 40:37.435
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR STICKING MY NOSE

40:37.435 --> 40:39.568
INTO THAT WHOLE PATTY RIZZO
THING.

40:39.568 --> 40:42.040
IT'S OKAY. I...

40:42.040 --> 40:45.213
THE TRUTH IS, IS I KNEW
SHE WAS COMING ON TO ME.

40:45.213 --> 40:48.617
THEN WHY DID YOU
KEEP HANGING OUT WITH HER?

40:50.649 --> 40:54.082
LYNETTE HAS BEEN
SO SWAMPED WITH WORK LATELY,

40:54.082 --> 40:55.684
THAT SHE DOESN'T...

40:57.756 --> 41:01.159
IT'S JUST NICE HAVING
A WOMAN NOTICE ME AGAIN.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.761
IS THAT TERRIBLE?

41:02.761 --> 41:04.963
NO. I GET IT.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.965
WHEN WE FIRST MOVED HERE,

41:06.965 --> 41:08.967
CARLOS WAS WORKING
ROUND THE CLOCK,

41:08.967 --> 41:11.970
AND HE'D COME HOME
AND BARELY SAY HELLO TO ME.
 HMM.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.072
IT WAS LIKE
I WAS INVISIBLE.

41:14.072 --> 41:17.576
INVISIBLE--
THAT'S THE WORD.

41:20.208 --> 41:24.553
SO WHEN HE DIDN'T SEE ME,
I FOUND SOMEONE WHO DID.

41:24.553 --> 41:27.155
Y-YOU KNOW
I'D NEVER DO THAT TO LYNETTE.

41:27.155 --> 41:29.618
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D DO IT TO CARLOS.

41:29.618 --> 41:32.691
WELL...

41:32.691 --> 41:34.693
THEN IT'S A GOOD THING

41:34.693 --> 41:37.696
I'VE GOT A FRIEND AROUND
TO KEEP AN EYE ON ME,

41:37.696 --> 41:39.698
EVEN IF IT'S ONE
WITH A SMALL "F."

41:39.698 --> 41:43.772
(laughs) WELL, FOR THE RECORD,
YOU'RE GROWING ON ME.

41:43.772 --> 41:45.774
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M THIRSTY.

41:45.774 --> 41:47.976
LET'S START A BOOK CLUB.

41:52.040 --> 41:56.715
THE FACT IS EVERYONE DOES IT.

41:56.715 --> 42:00.889
EVERYONE TRIES TO COVER UP WHAT
THEY DON'T WANT OTHERS TO SEE.

42:03.622 --> 42:07.726
WOMEN HIDE THEIR NEED
FOR COMMITMENT...

42:09.658 --> 42:13.101
MEN DISGUISE
THEIR GROWING INSECURITY...

42:15.604 --> 42:20.709
WIVES MASK
THEIR INTENSE DISDAIN.

42:20.709 --> 42:22.711
HOW CAN ORDINARY PEOPLE

42:22.711 --> 42:25.614
HIDE THE TRUTH OF THEIR
FEELINGS SO SUCCESSFULLY?

42:25.614 --> 42:29.748
ALL IT TAKES
IS A FRIENDLY GESTURE...

42:29.748 --> 42:32.550
YOU CAN'T PLAY
IN THE STREET, M.J.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.052
YOU COULD GET HURT,

42:34.052 --> 42:36.554
AND THAT WOULD REALLY TEAR
YOUR MOM APART.

42:38.927 --> 42:41.289
AND A PLAN.
