00:01.581 --> 00:05.047
- What time is it?
- # It's the nature of the beast #

00:05.082 --> 00:06.665
- A little after 5:00.
- # gotta earn your keep #

00:06.667 --> 00:09.835
I forget how long the waiting takes.

00:09.837 --> 00:14.590
- Here, have some more coffee.
- Thanks, Mom.

00:14.642 --> 00:16.809
- What was that?
- My watch must have stopped.

00:16.844 --> 00:19.595
Run! Run!

00:21.816 --> 00:23.015
Keep moving!

00:23.067 --> 00:25.651
When you get to the door,
remember,

00:25.686 --> 00:29.521
they moved everything last week.
Head right!

00:35.579 --> 00:37.696
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

00:39.200 --> 00:40.332
Mom!

00:40.584 --> 00:42.301
<i>Mom!</i>

00:46.707 --> 00:48.173
Great news.

00:48.209 --> 00:51.760
You're gonna get a dishwasher
with only one button. Yay!

00:52.880 --> 00:57.099
No.
Okay. Um...

00:57.134 --> 01:01.019
top and bottom rack,
regular soil, air...

01:01.055 --> 01:02.721
Don't air.

01:02.723 --> 01:05.891
O... but it has the little
energy saver symbol next to it.

01:05.893 --> 01:08.060
I know, but it takes
like nine hours to finish,

01:08.062 --> 01:10.028
and the sound of the fan
drives me crazy.

01:10.064 --> 01:14.950
Energy waster on.

01:14.985 --> 01:16.535
It would take less time
to wash them by hand.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.036
Okay, what?
What is your great news?

01:18.072 --> 01:21.990
Uh, your mother's Cousin Carlo called.
He's in town.

01:22.042 --> 01:24.209
- How did he get your number?
- I don't know.

01:24.245 --> 01:25.577
He said he was
in the neighborhood,

01:25.629 --> 01:26.795
and he's gonna stop by tonight.

01:26.831 --> 01:30.499
- Here?!
- Yes.

01:30.551 --> 01:33.886
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay, uh...

01:33.921 --> 01:36.805
call him back and tell him
that there's been another flood

01:36.841 --> 01:38.924
at the Dirty Robber
and Ma has to fix it.

01:38.976 --> 01:41.760
No, because then he'll go there,
and it'll be on Korsak.

01:41.812 --> 01:43.729
- What?
- Uh, call him back

01:43.764 --> 01:45.931
and tell him that Ma has pancreatitis.

01:45.983 --> 01:48.100
Okay, why do you want me to lie
to Cousin Carlo?

01:48.102 --> 01:50.068
Because he got $50,000

01:50.104 --> 01:52.187
from falling at a Rudy Tudy's
when he was 23 years old,

01:52.239 --> 01:54.022
and he's been chasing
the dream ever since.

01:54.074 --> 01:56.575
He slips, he falls, he sues.

01:56.610 --> 01:59.828
And nobody is safe...
restaurants, families, museums.

01:59.864 --> 02:02.223
Okay, well, I can't call
him back because he said that

02:02.224 --> 02:04.583
his phone broke and he was
calling from a pay phone.

02:04.618 --> 02:06.585
Of course he was.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.788
Okay, we're gonna have
to tape down all the rugs.

02:09.789 --> 02:11.874
Hi.

02:11.926 --> 02:13.709
Ma, did you give Cousin Carlo
Maura's number?

02:13.761 --> 02:17.962
- I would never.
- Well, he's coming here... tonight.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.683
I have to say, he's upped
his game a little bit.

02:21.719 --> 02:23.969
Okay, uh,
I'm gonna get rubber mats

02:24.021 --> 02:27.940
- for all these slippery hardwood floors.
- Okay, wait a minute.

02:27.975 --> 02:30.943
Have either one of you
ever actually seen him fall?

02:30.978 --> 02:33.529
- This is heavy.
- Uh, no.

02:33.564 --> 02:35.113
But his taste in Italian suits

02:35.149 --> 02:37.699
is way too nice for a guy
who doesn't have a job.

02:37.735 --> 02:40.619
He doesn't have a job,
and he has two Lexuses.

02:41.572 --> 02:45.657
- Or two "Lexi."
- Okay. But it's highly unlikely

02:45.709 --> 02:47.793
that he would do this
in front of his family.

02:47.828 --> 02:49.995
There are like a million
other people he could scam.

02:49.997 --> 02:52.664
You don't know Carlo.

02:52.716 --> 02:54.917
- Rizzoli.
- Isles.

02:54.969 --> 02:58.253
- Okay.
- Ma, you got this?

02:58.305 --> 03:01.640
- Yes.
- Okay. Knives.

03:01.675 --> 03:04.142
Noted.

03:28.045 --> 03:30.412
In order to sue,

03:30.464 --> 03:33.382
And I am many things, but
negligent is not one of them.

03:33.417 --> 03:36.418
Bigger purses than yours
have thought the same.

03:36.420 --> 03:38.587
All right, well,
have you ever seen broken feet

03:38.589 --> 03:40.055
on the chairs in my great room?

03:40.091 --> 03:41.590
Or glass all over the floor

03:41.592 --> 03:43.475
or a chandelier hanging
from a thread?

03:43.511 --> 03:46.395
- No, because that's not who I am.
- I agree.

03:46.430 --> 03:47.730
Your house does not look like

03:47.765 --> 03:49.682
some weird horror movie,
but he will adapt.

03:49.734 --> 03:51.567
And precautions need to be taken.

03:51.602 --> 03:53.018
Okay, we'll I'll keep my eye
on things,

03:53.070 --> 03:54.737
even though your mother

03:54.772 --> 03:57.072
is preparing my home
for a Rizzoli apocalypse.

03:58.109 --> 04:00.909
Victim's Helen Barnes, 53.

04:00.945 --> 04:04.913
500 people at this big sale.
Nobody saw anything.

04:04.949 --> 04:06.615
Our victim's daughter
said her mother

04:06.667 --> 04:08.701
would go big-sale hunting
all the time.

04:08.753 --> 04:12.087
Ooh. Wouldn't be the
first experienced shopper

04:12.123 --> 04:16.091
- to be taken out by a crowd.
- No, but that's not how she died.

04:16.127 --> 04:18.459
There's a wound on her lumbar region.

04:18.462 --> 04:20.713
- She was stabbed.
- Stabbed?

04:20.765 --> 04:23.632
For a five-second advantage
to get in the store?

04:23.634 --> 04:26.852
What, someone just had to get their
hands on the last blender?

04:26.887 --> 04:28.618
Well, they don't let you
bring blenders into jail,

04:28.619 --> 04:31.607
so that hardly seems worth it.
Maybe she was targeted.

04:31.642 --> 04:34.526
All right, we're gonna need
the store's security footage.

04:34.562 --> 04:35.778
I'm on it.

04:38.649 --> 04:42.151
Ugh. Makes me want to
give up going to malls.

04:42.153 --> 04:46.038
- You don't go to malls.
- Mission accomplished.

04:51.128 --> 04:53.078
Good lord.

04:53.130 --> 04:55.497
<i>It's worse than Kenmore Square
when the Sox won the series.</i>

04:55.549 --> 04:57.499
I can barely make anyone out.

04:59.503 --> 05:01.637
- There.
- I didn't see anyone stab her.

05:01.672 --> 05:03.889
Must have happened right before
she entered this camera angle.

05:03.924 --> 05:05.774
Let me back it up a little bit.

05:07.728 --> 05:12.064
Hey, can you play it half speed?

05:14.518 --> 05:16.518
Freeze it. Look at him.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.521
That guy. See how he
looks over his shoulder?

05:19.573 --> 05:20.939
He's not too interested
in the store, is he?

05:20.991 --> 05:22.691
I'll isolate him and
run facial recognition.

05:22.693 --> 05:24.026
Yeah.

05:32.787 --> 05:38.707
- I'm very sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

05:38.709 --> 05:41.543
She was a wonderful woman.

05:41.595 --> 05:44.680
Passionate about deals...

05:44.715 --> 05:49.685
- finding them, getting them.
- If she was so good at finding deals,

05:49.720 --> 05:52.330
do you think any of her
fellow shoppers might have

05:52.331 --> 05:54.940
- held a grudge against her?
- No, it wasn't like that.

05:54.975 --> 05:57.476
We'd see the same faces over and over.

05:57.528 --> 05:59.978
Getting a doorbuster
item was like a game.

06:00.030 --> 06:04.032
<i>There's no animosity in the community.</i>

06:04.168 --> 06:06.738
Have you ever seen this man?

06:08.472 --> 06:10.072
No.

06:13.077 --> 06:18.163
- Is that who killed my Mom?
- I don't know.

06:18.215 --> 06:21.216
Why would he do that?

06:21.252 --> 06:24.920
Why would he kill my mother?

06:28.759 --> 06:31.844
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:31.896 --> 06:33.762
Korsak's still in with
the victim's daughter.

06:33.764 --> 06:35.731
Well, we just I.D.'d
the guy from the Best Lots.

06:35.766 --> 06:37.099
His name's Elliot Dutton.

06:37.151 --> 06:38.734
Uniforms went to his
house, but he wasn't there.

06:38.769 --> 06:41.603
- Anything from the background check?
- No, nothing helpful.

06:41.605 --> 06:43.689
He's a bookkeeper... clean.

06:43.741 --> 06:46.074
You know, maybe we're reading
too much into this video.

06:46.110 --> 06:48.110
We see a killer looking
around for witnesses,

06:48.162 --> 06:50.946
but maybe this is just a guy going
back to his car for his wallet.

06:50.948 --> 06:52.498
Elliot Dutton just used his credit card

06:52.533 --> 06:54.166
to buy a ticket on a bus
leaving from Boston West.

06:54.201 --> 06:56.540
Or not.

06:56.954 --> 06:59.715
<i>Thanks.</i>

07:08.716 --> 07:11.600
<i>All passengers, please have
your tickets readily available</i>

07:11.635 --> 07:14.303
<i>to show the driver.
Thank you.</i>

07:34.208 --> 07:35.824
Elliot Dutton?

07:37.661 --> 07:40.629
Hey! Hey!

07:40.664 --> 07:42.748
- Stop! Police!
- Wait, wait! Hey, hey!

07:42.800 --> 07:44.883
Thank god you're here.
Oh, my god.

07:44.919 --> 07:47.669
He's chasing me, please.
Y-Y-You have help me.

07:47.721 --> 07:49.004
Okay, okay, calm down.
Who is chasing you?

07:49.056 --> 07:50.639
My boss. He wants to kill me.

07:50.674 --> 07:53.058
He just yelled my name.
Didn't you hear him?

07:54.929 --> 07:57.145
That was me, Mr. Dutton.

07:57.181 --> 07:59.765
- You?
- I just yelled your name.

07:59.817 --> 08:02.952
You come at...
suit and tie, hair...

08:02.953 --> 08:04.853
you called my name, right.

08:07.157 --> 08:09.858
- You called my name.
- All right.

08:09.910 --> 08:12.160
Uh, he called your name, yeah.

08:12.196 --> 08:14.817
Why don't you just, uh,
come with us? Come on.

08:22.616 --> 08:24.249
Why did you take my clothes?
I didn't do anything?

08:24.284 --> 08:25.867
Then why did you run?

08:25.919 --> 08:28.286
Like I said, I thought
my boss was chasing me.

08:30.757 --> 08:33.525
This woman was stabbed
outside of the Best Lots today.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.861
We have video of you
running from her body.

08:35.895 --> 08:37.596
What? I didn't kill anyone.

08:37.631 --> 08:40.515
I-I-I-I wa... my boss, he
attacked me at our office,

08:40.551 --> 08:43.034
and I was running away
to avoid being killed.

08:43.070 --> 08:45.220
So, you knew that large
crowd was gonna be there.

08:45.272 --> 08:47.522
Yeah, Best Lots is near where I work.

08:47.558 --> 08:49.808
I arrive early on sale
days to avoid traffic.

08:51.728 --> 08:53.645
I wouldn't hurt anyone.

09:00.821 --> 09:03.155
What are you doing?

09:03.157 --> 09:05.323
I'm trying to figure out if I know her.

09:05.325 --> 09:08.160
I have, uh, trouble
recognizing people's faces.

09:08.212 --> 09:10.829
It's called facial
recognition blindness.

09:10.831 --> 09:13.895
- Really?
- Yeah. If you were to walk away,

09:13.930 --> 09:15.634
I wouldn't recognize
you when you came back.

09:15.669 --> 09:17.903
Must make it hard to
differentiate between

09:17.904 --> 09:20.138
- good people and bad people.
- It does.

09:20.174 --> 09:22.140
- Does that make you nervous?
- All the time.

09:22.176 --> 09:24.092
You know, if I was in your
situation, I might carry a knife, too.

09:24.144 --> 09:25.894
I don't carry a knife.

09:25.929 --> 09:29.764
- I didn't stab anyone.
- I'll be right back.

09:31.685 --> 09:32.817
Where's she going?

09:35.822 --> 09:37.989
It's a real thing... prosopagnosia.

09:38.025 --> 09:40.108
I'm sorry, it's not a real thing.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.827
Fear of spiders... that's a real thing.

09:42.863 --> 09:45.080
Hot dogs... those are real things.

09:45.115 --> 09:48.166
- Hot dogs are barely a real thing.
- Maura...

09:48.202 --> 09:51.203
So, what happens is
the part of the brain

09:51.255 --> 09:54.339
that distinguishes facial
features doesn't work.

09:54.374 --> 09:57.209
People like you and me, we take
a mental picture of someone,

09:57.211 --> 09:59.010
and we store it in our minds.

09:59.046 --> 10:02.631
Prosopagnosics, they take a picture,
and then they throw it away.

10:02.683 --> 10:04.099
They don't even recognize their parents.

10:04.134 --> 10:06.268
It feels like a silver lining there.

10:06.303 --> 10:09.221
But his mother probably
is nothing like my mother.

10:09.223 --> 10:11.640
In order to cope, people
with this condition

10:11.692 --> 10:13.608
find other ways to tell people apart.

10:13.644 --> 10:15.193
Their build, hair, their voice.

10:15.229 --> 10:17.696
2% of the population actually
has it in some capacity.

10:17.731 --> 10:20.899
Okay, fine, it's a real thing.
But he's probably lying about having it.

10:20.951 --> 10:22.984
Did you find any blood
evidence on his clothes?

10:23.036 --> 10:25.237
Uh, no, they are still being processed.

10:25.239 --> 10:28.907
Oh, you know, there are
prosopagnosia research centers

10:28.909 --> 10:32.127
at Dartmouth, Harvard,
and University College London.

10:32.162 --> 10:34.296
Gosh, I would love to
escort him to London

10:34.331 --> 10:35.880
to have him checked out,

10:35.916 --> 10:37.999
but I feel that might
stall our investigation.

10:39.219 --> 10:41.836
Give me your lab coat.

10:44.558 --> 10:45.924
No.

10:48.262 --> 10:52.731
Why are you looking... at my lab coat?

10:52.766 --> 10:56.818
- That's you, correct?
- That's the jacket I was wearing.

10:56.853 --> 10:58.979
Do you understand why
we're concerned since you're

10:58.980 --> 11:01.106
standing right next to a
woman who was just stabbed.

11:01.158 --> 11:03.349
- Yes.
- And if any of her blood

11:03.391 --> 11:04.943
is on your clothes, it might
be enough to put you away.

11:04.995 --> 11:06.945
Now are you sure you don't
want to tell me something else?

11:06.947 --> 11:09.948
I didn't kill her.
I-I was running for my life.

11:09.950 --> 11:11.392
From the boss who was

11:11.393 --> 11:12.834
- attacking you for no reason.
- Yes.

11:20.844 --> 11:22.294
Excuse me.

11:22.346 --> 11:25.096
Oh, this is Dr. Kepley.

11:25.132 --> 11:28.383
- She'll be consulting on this case.
- Hi.

11:28.435 --> 11:30.969
We'd like you to take
a look at some pictures.

11:30.971 --> 11:32.137
We're hoping that you recognize

11:32.138 --> 11:33.888
one of these men from the crime scene.

11:33.940 --> 11:36.224
- I don't... I...
- Take your time.

11:44.735 --> 11:46.151
I don't recognize any of them.

11:46.203 --> 11:48.703
- Are you sure.
- I'm sorry.

11:48.739 --> 11:53.124
Seriously?
It's pictures of the same two guys.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.161
One of them is sitting
right in front of you.

11:56.163 --> 12:00.298
- Detective Rizzoli?
- Mm.

12:00.334 --> 12:04.252
There was no blood on
Elliot's clothes or hands,

12:04.304 --> 12:06.338
which there should have
been given his proximity.

12:06.390 --> 12:08.340
So he didn't stab Helen.

12:08.392 --> 12:11.226
Facial recognition blindness...
now I've heard everything.

12:11.261 --> 12:12.894
Happy to learn about it,
glad I don't have it.

12:12.929 --> 12:16.231
Admit it... you'd miss my face.

12:17.818 --> 12:20.185
If we believe him,
Elliot was the target.

12:20.187 --> 12:22.020
Helen was just collateral damage,

12:22.072 --> 12:25.523
- which makes him a material witness.
- Worst witness ever.

12:25.525 --> 12:28.443
I guess it's like dealing
with a masked attacker.

12:28.495 --> 12:31.079
What do we know about this
boss who was chasing him?

12:31.114 --> 12:35.033
Franklin Simms.
Owns a chain of dry cleaners...

12:35.085 --> 12:36.501
17 locations throughout the city,

12:36.536 --> 12:38.370
no history of violence,
no criminal record.

12:38.422 --> 12:41.039
Nina couldn't find him in any
of the footage of the stampede.

12:41.041 --> 12:44.042
- But it's a stampede.
- Helen was stabbed

12:44.044 --> 12:46.094
in her lower back near the L1 vertebra.

12:46.129 --> 12:48.096
That's an unusual place to be stabbed.

12:48.131 --> 12:50.131
Unless you're chasing
someone through a crowd,

12:50.183 --> 12:52.384
trying desperately to kill
them before they get away.

12:52.436 --> 12:54.052
Don't you hate it when that happens?

12:54.104 --> 12:58.890
- Guess we ought to go find him.
- Okay.

13:03.063 --> 13:05.113
You know, even if I had prosopagnosia,

13:05.148 --> 13:07.065
I'd still be able to recognize you.

13:07.067 --> 13:09.901
Nobody in the department
has a mane like that.

13:09.903 --> 13:14.572
- Oh, thank you.
- No... that person I do not know.

13:14.574 --> 13:17.075
Don't tell anybody I
did that, all right?

13:17.077 --> 13:20.161
I don't even want to remember it.

13:52.946 --> 13:54.245
Korsak.

13:56.917 --> 14:00.084
Found him.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.698
Five wounds, all
concentrated to his torso.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.617
Is it the same knife that killed Helen?

14:17.669 --> 14:19.285
Well, it appears that the apex
of the incised wounds

14:19.337 --> 14:20.920
is indeed rough and uneven,

14:20.956 --> 14:23.790
which would be consistent
with what Helen suffered.

14:23.842 --> 14:27.127
- "Indeed" is close to "yes," right?
- Yes, adjacent.

14:27.179 --> 14:30.713
Okay, so, from this point of view,
you can't see the body.

14:30.715 --> 14:32.348
So, Elliot comes in,

14:32.384 --> 14:35.051
he sees a guy in a suit
and thinks that it's Simms?

14:35.053 --> 14:38.188
Well, if the killer had
brown hair and wore a suit,

14:38.223 --> 14:40.857
in the frenzy of an attack,
it would be an easy mistake

14:40.892 --> 14:42.859
for somebody with prosopagnosia to make.

14:42.894 --> 14:44.611
Elliot came in early
because of the sale.

14:44.646 --> 14:48.114
- Killer didn't expect him.
- So Simms was the killer's target.

14:48.150 --> 14:51.516
And Elliot was his hapless,
not really an eye-witness.

14:57.909 --> 14:59.659
That bric setup is impressive.

14:59.711 --> 15:02.245
Yeah, we've made a lot of
improvements this year.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.913
- Oh.
- I haven't seen you around.

15:03.965 --> 15:05.965
- Detective...?
- Fordham.

15:06.001 --> 15:08.301
I just transferred here.
I'm on the second floor.

15:08.336 --> 15:10.053
Uh, welcome.

15:10.088 --> 15:12.138
I'm happy to answer any
questions you might have.

15:12.174 --> 15:15.091
Thanks.
I'll try and carve out some time.

15:15.093 --> 15:17.810
Yeah, any time.
You can always find me right over...

15:17.846 --> 15:21.731
Uh... excuse me.
I got to get this.

15:21.766 --> 15:24.184
- Hi, Ma.
- Hey, Frankie?

15:24.236 --> 15:26.352
Hey, I really need your help.

15:26.404 --> 15:29.072
Cousin Carlo is coming over to Maura's.

15:29.107 --> 15:30.823
What? Why?

15:30.859 --> 15:34.777
<i>Yeah, I know. It's terrible.
He said he wants to see me.</i>

15:34.779 --> 15:39.782
- Did you try to cancel?
- Yes, but he's incommunicado.

15:39.834 --> 15:42.085
All right, are you
getting the house ready?

15:42.120 --> 15:45.522
<i>Of course.
But I needed more floor mats,</i>

15:45.523 --> 15:47.040
<i>and there's an accident on 90.</i>

15:47.092 --> 15:50.677
Listen, Frankie, I need you
to get to the house in case I'm late.

15:50.712 --> 15:53.346
We can't leave Maura
there alone with him.

15:53.381 --> 15:55.682
No, I'm really busy today, Mom.
I can't leave.

15:55.717 --> 15:58.051
<i>Oh, come on. That's
what Janie said, damn it.</i>

15:58.103 --> 16:00.970
I need a Rizzoli there
at all times in that house.

16:03.191 --> 16:05.358
Whoa! Wh...

16:05.393 --> 16:08.978
- What just happened?
- Maura's new car just saved my life.

16:08.980 --> 16:11.698
Well, not my life, but still...
Listen, Frankie!

16:11.733 --> 16:14.067
Damn it, I need somebody
to be at the house!

16:14.119 --> 16:19.239
Ma, Ma, I got to go, okay?
Good luck. I love you.

16:20.341 --> 16:24.676
I'm sorry about that.

16:31.219 --> 16:34.337
Don't I kind of stand out
among all these old people?

16:34.339 --> 16:36.506
BPD has an apartment at
Lavintman's for years.

16:36.508 --> 16:39.309
- We've never had a problem.
- The guy who's looking for you

16:39.344 --> 16:41.344
is gonna look in a
lot of different places

16:41.346 --> 16:43.730
before he looks in an
assisted-living facility.

16:43.765 --> 16:46.182
We have department approval
to keep you here for 48 hours.

16:46.184 --> 16:48.518
You'll be guarded by
a rotation of officers.

16:48.520 --> 16:51.988
- This is... uh, sir?
- Sorry. Officer Mekler.

16:52.023 --> 16:53.906
Officer Mekler will be here to 8:00 P.M.

16:53.942 --> 16:57.493
- He'll be replaced by someone new.
- Um, officer, could you keep your hat on?

16:57.529 --> 16:59.495
That'll help Mr. Dutton recognize you.

16:59.531 --> 17:01.364
- No problem.
- Thank you.

17:01.416 --> 17:03.366
You're only gonna
protect me for 48 hours?

17:03.418 --> 17:07.537
Well, two days is a long
time in an investigation.

17:07.539 --> 17:09.204
I don't why Mr. Simms attacked me.

17:09.257 --> 17:12.929
But if you can't find him, what's
to keep him from trying again?

17:14.462 --> 17:16.262
Mr. Simms didn't attack you.

17:16.298 --> 17:19.965
- What?
- Elliot, Mr. Simms is dead.

17:20.018 --> 17:23.303
He was killed this morning
before you went into the office.

17:23.355 --> 17:26.856
- H-He didn't try to kill me?
- No.

17:29.311 --> 17:34.230
Of course.
Why would he try to kill me?

17:34.232 --> 17:36.482
I can't believe
I thought he was chasing me.

17:36.534 --> 17:38.034
Why don't you tell us everything

17:38.069 --> 17:39.485
you can remember about this morning?

17:39.537 --> 17:45.074
- I just... can I have a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

17:50.332 --> 17:52.081
<i>I've always loved jazz, you know?</i>

17:52.133 --> 17:54.584
I live down the street
from Chick Corea in Chelsea.

17:54.586 --> 17:56.419
He played my 16th birthday party.

17:56.421 --> 17:58.971
Really? Oh, that must
have been very special.

17:59.007 --> 18:01.174
- There you go, Maura.
- Thank you, Carlo.

18:02.427 --> 18:05.895
So, Angela is stuck in traffic.
She should be here any moment.

18:05.930 --> 18:08.264
All those mats in the kitchen...
you must do a lot of cooking.

18:08.316 --> 18:11.017
Uh, well, uh, even for wood floors,

18:11.069 --> 18:14.987
French oak is so unforgiving.

18:15.023 --> 18:16.606
So, what do you do for a living?

18:16.608 --> 18:18.157
- Music.
- Oh, you play?

18:18.193 --> 18:20.943
Trumpet, but I mostly teach.

18:20.945 --> 18:24.447
I love the trumpet.
Such a heraldic instrument.

18:24.499 --> 18:26.282
Yeah, I'd like to play more,

18:26.284 --> 18:29.202
but had to give up the
dream in order to survive.

18:29.254 --> 18:32.372
<i>Oh, god, I'm so sorry I'm late.</i>

18:32.424 --> 18:34.173
Angela, sweetheart!

18:34.209 --> 18:36.959
You look fantastic.

18:36.961 --> 18:40.346
- Come here. Come here.
- Aw.

18:40.382 --> 18:42.014
Nice to see you, Carlo.

18:42.050 --> 18:44.016
<i>Yeah, yeah, you too, honey.</i>

18:44.052 --> 18:47.303
- Hey.
- I will leave the two of you to catch up.

18:47.355 --> 18:50.106
Before we sit down,
I need to use the restroom.

18:50.141 --> 18:53.226
- It's broken.
- The downstairs? Oh.

18:53.278 --> 18:55.061
Well, there's another
one just up the stairs.

18:55.113 --> 18:56.479
Not the stairs.

18:56.481 --> 18:59.682
- Angela.
- Maura.

19:00.285 --> 19:02.151
You're right, you're right.

19:02.153 --> 19:06.456
Um, Frankie did fix
the bathroom downstairs.

19:06.491 --> 19:09.208
- It's right through there.
- Thank you.

19:14.382 --> 19:17.333
Socks.
You let him wear socks?!

19:17.335 --> 19:19.218
Do you want to be homeless?

19:19.254 --> 19:22.138
Hey, Angela?
We are having a lovely time.

19:22.173 --> 19:26.342
He has no reason to have an accident.
He does work, you know.

19:26.344 --> 19:29.262
The trumpet?
Yeah, he blows a lot of hot air.

19:29.314 --> 19:32.482
- No, he teaches now.
- Yeah, I don't know about that.

19:32.517 --> 19:34.434
Angela, when is the last
time you saw Cousin Carlo?

19:34.486 --> 19:37.520
- A couple of Christmases ago.
- Exactly.

19:37.522 --> 19:40.490
So, maybe he's outgrown his problem.

19:40.525 --> 19:42.275
<i>The tile work in here is lovely.</i>

19:42.327 --> 19:46.216
Oh, the night is young.

19:51.369 --> 19:53.035
Hey, Jane.

19:53.487 --> 19:55.204
How did you know it was me?

19:55.256 --> 19:59.592
- One leg is longer than the other.
- Longer...

19:59.627 --> 20:03.379
One heel hits harder... thump, thump.

20:03.431 --> 20:07.216
Okay.
We need to talk about the case.

20:09.020 --> 20:11.554
You want me to help you
find a man I can't recognize

20:11.606 --> 20:14.307
who's trying to kill me
for a reason I don't know.

20:14.359 --> 20:16.392
Elliot, you have to remember something

20:16.444 --> 20:18.227
and you never know what could help.

20:18.279 --> 20:19.946
But when I'm stressed out,

20:19.981 --> 20:22.615
the techniques I use
to get through the day,

20:22.650 --> 20:24.317
they don't work very well.

20:24.369 --> 20:27.570
You mean like remembering
hair or jewelry

20:27.572 --> 20:32.241
- or weird leg length?
- Right.

20:32.293 --> 20:37.497
My mother... she, uh, wore
the same kind of clothes.

20:37.549 --> 20:40.216
She never changed her hair.

20:40.251 --> 20:43.503
But still, sometimes when I
saw her out in the neighborhood,

20:43.555 --> 20:46.255
I wouldn't even know who she was.

20:46.757 --> 20:49.258
Is this condition the reason

20:49.310 --> 20:51.427
that you've lived in the
same place for 15 years?

20:51.479 --> 20:53.479
Uh, I change as little as I can...

20:53.515 --> 20:56.766
same apartment, same
route to work, same stores.

20:56.768 --> 20:59.402
- So people know you.
- Right.

20:59.437 --> 21:02.104
At least the people that
think I'm stupid or rude...

21:02.106 --> 21:05.583
it's the same group of people.

21:05.660 --> 21:09.445
I, um...

21:09.447 --> 21:12.081
I dream of going to other places.

21:12.116 --> 21:14.116
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:14.118 --> 21:16.534
- Where do you dream of going?
- Don't laugh.

21:16.569 --> 21:19.789
- I will not.
- Norway.

21:19.791 --> 21:24.510
- Really?
- I want to see fjords.

21:24.546 --> 21:27.013
What's gonna happen
when my 48 hours are up?

21:27.048 --> 21:29.348
Well, why don't we address
that when we get to it?

21:29.384 --> 21:34.136
That woman is dead because I
couldn't tell the difference

21:34.188 --> 21:38.307
between a killer and a man
I'd worked with for six years.

21:38.309 --> 21:41.527
Elliot, you have a medical condition.
You couldn't help it.

21:41.563 --> 21:43.362
I just don't want
anyone else to get hurt.

21:43.398 --> 21:46.449
Okay, well, let's agree
on nobody else gets hurt.

21:46.484 --> 21:50.119
- That includes you.
- That is nice of you to say.

21:50.154 --> 21:55.041
But the truth is,
if anything happened to me,

21:55.076 --> 21:58.481
no one would even notice.

22:05.184 --> 22:06.567
What do you got?

22:06.602 --> 22:08.352
Elliot may have facial
recognition problems,

22:08.404 --> 22:10.437
but he also may have
bullshit recognition problems.

22:10.439 --> 22:12.439
There's a piece missing
from his books. Look.

22:12.491 --> 22:17.194
25% of the company's annual
income is paid to "dividends."

22:17.246 --> 22:19.413
This year, that amounted
to $750,000.

22:19.448 --> 22:20.682
Whew.
Pretty nice little payout.

22:20.683 --> 22:23.834
- What's the problem?
- It's all paid in cash,

22:23.870 --> 22:25.836
and there are no corresponding
accounts indicating where it's going.

22:25.872 --> 22:28.422
- Nothing?
- Just says "dividends."

22:28.457 --> 22:30.424
We didn't find any tax
records in his office, did we?

22:30.459 --> 22:34.044
No. And it'll take the I.R.S.
a year to comply with a subpoena.

22:34.096 --> 22:37.932
Well, let's get Jane to ask
Elliot what he knows about it.

22:46.225 --> 22:51.979
- Hey, Jane.
- I was trying to walk really evenly.

22:51.981 --> 22:56.033
- Even without the walk, there's the hair.
- Nothing gets past you, huh?

22:56.068 --> 22:59.153
- How was your night?
- Old people snore.

22:59.205 --> 23:01.238
- Hm.
- Yeah.

23:01.290 --> 23:04.375
Elliot, we need to talk
about Villa's finances.

23:04.410 --> 23:08.495
- Uh, oh, is there a problem?
- The dividend payout...

23:08.497 --> 23:11.048
three quarters of
a million dollars last year.

23:11.083 --> 23:14.301
- You have any idea where
that was going?  - No.

23:14.637 --> 23:18.004
Elliot, I can't help you if
you don't tell me the truth.

23:18.039 --> 23:21.342
I was just the bookkeeper.
I didn't do corporate filings or taxes.

23:21.394 --> 23:23.928
But that doesn't mean you didn't
know something was going on.

23:30.987 --> 23:35.155
The Cleaners had a really high
number of cash transactions.

23:35.191 --> 23:37.908
I thought there should
have been more credit cards.

23:37.944 --> 23:40.278
- Did you ever say anything about it?
- It's hard to keep

23:40.279 --> 23:42.613
your job when you
can't recognize your bosses.

23:42.665 --> 23:44.615
I decided I would not ask any questions

23:44.667 --> 23:47.034
so Simms would look the
other way on my thing.

23:47.086 --> 23:50.371
Did you ever notice anything out
of the ordinary in any of the shops?

23:50.373 --> 23:52.706
No, but I've only been
to the one near my house.

23:52.708 --> 23:55.676
They never asked you to pick
up any receipts or deposits

23:55.711 --> 23:58.679
- at any of the other locations?
- Simms did that himself.

23:58.714 --> 24:00.882
I always thought he was
just being nice because

24:00.883 --> 24:03.050
he knew I was uncomfortable
being out in the world.

24:03.102 --> 24:08.055
- That wasn't it, was it?
- I don't know yet.

24:08.107 --> 24:10.441
I'll come check on you later, okay?

24:10.476 --> 24:13.610
- Okay.
- All right, hang in there.

24:17.233 --> 24:19.566
Jane's right... there's
more to Mr. Simms' reluctance

24:19.568 --> 24:22.069
to let Elliot see the
Cleaners than just kindness.

24:22.121 --> 24:24.071
Four years ago, Villa Cleaners
began expanding

24:24.123 --> 24:26.206
<i>and acquired these six properties.</i>

24:26.242 --> 24:28.409
They added four locations
a year after that.

24:28.461 --> 24:30.627
<i>I pulled these pictures from
an online mapping program.</i>

24:30.663 --> 24:33.130
Are you sure the addresses are right?

24:33.165 --> 24:36.000
I drove by that one
myself just to make sure.

24:36.052 --> 24:37.584
There's no way they were pulling in

24:37.586 --> 24:39.753
that much revenue from just
six legitimate locations.

24:39.755 --> 24:41.338
They must be laundering money.

24:41.390 --> 24:43.307
That's why most of the
transactions are in cash.

24:43.342 --> 24:46.060
This location had a fire yesterday...

24:46.095 --> 24:48.095
just a few hours after
Helen was murdered.

24:48.097 --> 24:51.598
- Well, that's a little coincidental.
- Killer's a step ahead of us.

24:58.107 --> 25:00.107
- Detective Kain?
- Yeah.

25:00.159 --> 25:02.109
Vince Korsak.
We spoke on the phone.

25:02.111 --> 25:04.078
- This is Detective Rizzoli.
- Nice to meet you both.

25:04.113 --> 25:06.280
You said this property was linked
to a homicide investigation?

25:06.282 --> 25:08.365
- Yeah, you mind if we take a look?
- No, come on in.

25:08.417 --> 25:11.368
We already finished our investigation.
It was definitely arson.

25:11.420 --> 25:13.420
Dog sniffed accelerant right away.

25:13.456 --> 25:16.123
Seems like some kind of
makeshift office here.

25:16.125 --> 25:19.093
Receipts in the garbage indicate
they've been here a few months at least.

25:19.128 --> 25:21.462
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

25:23.466 --> 25:28.302
- Hard drive's been drilled... useless.
- They're hiding something.

25:40.282 --> 25:43.150
Amateurs.

25:44.286 --> 25:46.548
- What do you got?
- They didn't stir the embers.

25:46.583 --> 25:49.736
We may still be able to figure
out what they were up to.

26:05.474 --> 26:08.559
- What are you doing?
- How did you know it was me?

26:08.594 --> 26:11.428
- You were clomping.
- You recognized my clomping?

26:11.480 --> 26:14.181
No, I heard clomping, I looked up,

26:14.183 --> 26:16.066
and I saw my best friend
being weird.

26:16.102 --> 26:18.735
Did you know that I have one
leg that's longer than the other?

26:18.771 --> 26:20.654
- Really?
- That's what Elliot

26:20.689 --> 26:23.524
the propis-fuh-fuh told
me after hearing me walk.

26:23.576 --> 26:25.526
Hm.
He has a very strong ear.

26:25.578 --> 26:29.363
It is common with that condition.
You should get that looked at.

26:29.365 --> 26:31.165
I don't want to get it looked at.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.534
Well, it could cause damage
to you back over time.

26:33.536 --> 26:35.536
Simple enough to lengthen the other leg.

26:35.588 --> 26:37.171
I don't need to be taller, Maura.

26:37.206 --> 26:38.839
Men are already afraid
of me enough as it is.

26:38.874 --> 26:42.442
And you think it's because you're tall?

26:42.477 --> 26:44.511
That was a good one.

26:44.547 --> 26:47.280
I heard it went well
with Cousin Carlo last night.

26:47.315 --> 26:50.100
- It did.
- Good, I'm glad.

26:50.136 --> 26:53.137
- Although, I didn't expect anything less.
- All right.

26:53.189 --> 26:55.722
- Well, I'll see you later.
- Mm-hmm.

27:05.868 --> 27:08.402
You didn't have to give me gelato.

27:08.454 --> 27:12.873
Well, after what I did to your house,
I felt you deserved it.

27:12.908 --> 27:15.492
Well, I'm not gonna say no to pistachio.

27:15.544 --> 27:17.494
Who's that?

27:17.546 --> 27:19.246
Did you order in?

27:19.298 --> 27:21.788
- No.
- Hmm.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.764
Janie, thanks for running over.

28:12.816 --> 28:17.068
But I think Maura was right.
He's changed.

28:17.103 --> 28:20.572
You don't think this
is some kind of play?

28:20.607 --> 28:21.773
No.

28:21.825 --> 28:24.859
- Janie! Hey.
- Hey, Carlo.

28:24.861 --> 28:28.246
Janie, it's so good to see you.
I'm so glad you stopped by.

28:28.281 --> 28:30.865
- Yeah...
- How have you been?

28:30.867 --> 28:34.035
- B... Busy.
- Oh, well, busy looks good on you.

28:34.037 --> 28:35.870
Yeah, thank you.

28:35.872 --> 28:39.374
Ah, zeppole's ready.

28:39.376 --> 28:42.210
Wh... you made zeppoles?

28:42.212 --> 28:43.878
I didn't know if I was gonna see you,

28:43.880 --> 28:45.880
so I wanted to make
something that could travel.

28:45.932 --> 28:48.683
- And I know you love my zeppole.
- Can I have 10?

28:48.718 --> 28:51.986
Coming right up.

28:53.190 --> 28:56.391
- He must be medicated.
- Shh!

28:56.393 --> 28:58.059
Well, it's probably
better for all of us.

28:58.061 --> 29:02.313
Um... are we okay
that he's working with boiling oil?

29:02.365 --> 29:05.733
Come on, he's fine.
And if he was what you say he was,

29:05.735 --> 29:08.653
then he certainly doesn't
fit that description anymore.

29:08.705 --> 29:11.155
And I did take some precautions.

29:11.208 --> 29:16.177
<i>Godere questo bellisimo
desserto de zeppole.</i>

29:16.212 --> 29:17.629
- Ooh.
- Ooh, they look great.

29:17.664 --> 29:19.330
- Thank you, Carlo.
- Of course.

29:19.382 --> 29:21.416
- Thank you.
- You know what?

29:21.418 --> 29:25.136
I think we could use a
little more powdered sugar.

29:26.339 --> 29:30.008
- I told you so.
- Don't you "I told you so" me!

29:30.060 --> 29:32.343
Oh, I will "I told you so" you
as long as I'm right.

29:32.395 --> 29:34.229
What?!
That doesn't even make sense!

29:34.264 --> 29:35.897
Okay, what are you, 12?

29:35.932 --> 29:38.316
Hm, looks like we spilled a little...
Whoa!

29:38.351 --> 29:40.351
<i>...oil.</i>

29:40.403 --> 29:42.353
Uh-oh.

29:56.119 --> 29:59.254
- Has he called yet?
- Nope.

29:59.289 --> 30:02.957
- He'll call.
- We will deal with it if he does.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.677
Mm-hmm.
What do we got here?

30:05.712 --> 30:09.797
Using this ultraviolet,
infrared DSLR camera,

30:09.849 --> 30:11.766
we take pictures of the burnt paper.

30:11.801 --> 30:14.761
The computer analyzes the
image, and we can, up to 70%

30:14.762 --> 30:17.722
of the time, bring up whatever
is underneath the burn.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.307
- Some fancy camera.
- Mm-hmm.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.777
- Anything interesting yet?
- Primarily receipts and pay stubs.

30:22.812 --> 30:25.446
I'm not sure what this fire
was supposed to be covering up.

30:25.482 --> 30:27.865
Well, we think they
were laundering money.

30:27.901 --> 30:30.451
Creating receipts helps
the income look legitimate.

30:30.487 --> 30:32.203
Maura, this says "I.R.S."

30:32.238 --> 30:34.822
Right here, Maura, can you
process this one right now?

30:34.874 --> 30:37.208
Sure.

30:49.839 --> 30:52.974
"Audit requires all
records for Villa Cleaners

30:53.009 --> 30:57.979
and its shareholders,
including Koko Inc."

30:59.014 --> 31:02.350
That's some magic camera you got there.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.792
<i>Thanks, Maura.</i>

31:09.025 --> 31:12.243
- So?
- Koko Inc. is a shell corporation

31:12.278 --> 31:14.746
- that is wholly owned by Mary Ann Wilkhousen.
- She's a lawyer.

31:14.781 --> 31:16.831
Everything about her and her
corporation is legitimate.

31:16.866 --> 31:19.917
Mary Ann Wilkhousen?
When I was in the organized crime unit,

31:19.953 --> 31:21.836
she worked as an attorney
for Spencer Romero.

31:21.871 --> 31:24.005
I think they had more than
just a working relationship.

31:24.040 --> 31:25.340
Wait, Spencer Romero?

31:25.375 --> 31:27.208
- The Spencer Romero?
- Who's that?

31:27.210 --> 31:29.510
<i>Oh, he's a thuggish drug
dealer from the East Side.</i>

31:29.546 --> 31:33.047
BPD suspects him in at least 10 murders,
but he does the jobs himself.

31:33.049 --> 31:35.016
There's never anyone
to flip to convict him.

31:37.220 --> 31:39.771
I'll bet he's the source of the
cash Villa's been laundering.

31:39.806 --> 31:42.190
Simms must have panicked when
he got the notice from the I.R.S.

31:42.225 --> 31:44.335
- He told Romero...
- And Romero killed him

31:44.437 --> 31:46.477
- to get rid of loose ends.
- Okay, but how do we pin on him

31:46.529 --> 31:49.897
with our witness who isn't
really a witness? Hmm?

31:52.723 --> 31:56.845
We think that this man is
associate with Mr. Simms.

31:56.846 --> 32:00.291
- Does he look familiar... any way?
- Not really.

32:00.326 --> 32:01.492
- I-I'm sorry
- It's okay.

32:01.544 --> 32:03.961
Uh, let's... let's just watch this.

32:03.997 --> 32:07.081
<i>So, we're just looking to take
a few kilos off your hands.</i>

32:07.083 --> 32:10.218
<i>- For how much?
- We're good with the usual rate.</i>

32:10.253 --> 32:13.388
<i>Get out of here.
You think I'm an idiot?</i>

32:13.423 --> 32:16.424
- Anything about his mannerisms?
- Nothing.

32:16.476 --> 32:19.177
I don't recognize him.
I want to help.

32:19.229 --> 32:20.428
Okay, Elliot.

32:20.480 --> 32:24.482
Just... you do this every day, okay?

32:24.517 --> 32:27.819
You recognize people by characteristics
that other people don't see.

32:27.854 --> 32:30.605
You lived your whole
life this way, so just...

32:32.525 --> 32:34.826
Okay? Calm down.

32:34.861 --> 32:36.027
I've got all day.

32:36.079 --> 32:39.414
- Okay, uh, play it again.
- Okay.

32:39.449 --> 32:42.116
<i>So, we're just looking to take
a few kilos off your hands.</i>

32:42.168 --> 32:44.118
<i>For how much?</i>

32:44.170 --> 32:46.254
<i>We're good with the usual rate.</i>

32:46.289 --> 32:49.424
- That last bit... play it again.
- Okay.

32:49.459 --> 32:51.092
<i>We're good with the usual rate.</i>

32:51.127 --> 32:53.428
<i>That clicking.</i>

32:53.463 --> 32:55.296
That's Mr. Wilkhousen.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.632
- Wilkhousen.
- Yeah, he came around a bit.

32:57.634 --> 33:00.885
He always smelled like he came
straight from a Hookah Bar.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.303
Okay.

33:02.305 --> 33:04.355
Okay, Elliot, that's great.
That's all I needed.

33:04.390 --> 33:05.973
Is Mr. Wilkhousen selling drugs?

33:05.975 --> 33:08.142
Because I never saw anything
like that at the office.

33:08.144 --> 33:10.546
I'm sorry, Elliot,
I-I-I can't
really say

33:10.547 --> 33:12.647
- anything about the case.
- Who is he?

33:14.150 --> 33:17.118
I have a right to know
what I'm dealing with here.

33:17.153 --> 33:21.072
Okay.
His real name is Spencer Romero.

33:21.124 --> 33:24.659
But Elliot, that's... that's really all
that I can tell you, okay?

33:24.661 --> 33:26.752
And... and I just... I don't want
you to worry about anything,

33:26.798 --> 33:28.463
all right?
You're very safe here.

33:28.498 --> 33:30.414
I thought I have to
leave after 48 hours.

33:30.467 --> 33:31.916
I'm working on that, too.

33:33.670 --> 33:35.586
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:35.638 --> 33:38.506
Thank you. Thank you.

33:45.515 --> 33:48.015
Romero was in their offices.
Elliot I.D.'ed him.

33:48.017 --> 33:49.901
Visiting the office isn't a crime.

33:49.936 --> 33:52.604
But as a witness for Simms'
murder, defense attorney

33:52.605 --> 33:55.273
would have field day
with his facial blindness.

33:55.325 --> 33:59.410
What if we got Romero on tax evasion
and money laundering?

33:59.445 --> 34:01.445
I mean, we've got the burnt receipts,

34:01.498 --> 34:03.698
- we've got Elliot's books.
- That might work.

34:03.700 --> 34:06.000
With Elliot's extensive
knowledge of Villa's accounting,

34:06.035 --> 34:07.502
could be enough to bring Romero down.

34:07.537 --> 34:09.536
I mean, the charges aren't sexy,
but they worked on Capone.

34:09.539 --> 34:11.088
Would this be enough to get Elliot

34:11.123 --> 34:13.174
more permanent protection
while we work on Romero?

34:13.208 --> 34:15.710
I'll call upstairs. Half a witness
against Romero is better than none.

34:15.712 --> 34:20.130
Right, I'll go tell him we might
be able to buy him some more time.

34:26.723 --> 34:30.690
- He's in the can.
- Thanks for the report.

34:34.364 --> 34:36.731
Ew, it really does smell
like old people in here.

34:36.733 --> 34:38.366
Yeah, you get used to it.

34:44.239 --> 34:49.043
- How long has he been in there?
- I don't know. A while.

34:55.418 --> 34:56.751
Elliot?

34:56.753 --> 34:59.053
Elliot, it's Jane.
You all right?

35:06.179 --> 35:09.263
- Shit! He's gone.
- What?

35:09.265 --> 35:10.598
What happened?

35:10.600 --> 35:13.401
- Uh, nothing.
- No, not nothing... something!

35:13.436 --> 35:16.187
Uh, used my phone to check
the score of the game.

35:16.239 --> 35:20.157
- He said he had to use the bathroom.
- Give me your phone.

35:22.779 --> 35:24.845
Shit!

35:32.545 --> 35:36.881
He hasn't used his credit cards
or taken cash out of an ATM.

35:36.933 --> 35:39.476
- Should have confiscated his wallet.
- Frankie said Elliot's

35:39.477 --> 35:42.020
not at his house, but it looks
like he was there recently.

35:42.055 --> 35:44.689
Well, he's spooked, so he'll try
and get as far away as he can.

35:44.724 --> 35:46.491
If we can just find him, BPD is willing

35:46.526 --> 35:48.142
to keep him in a safe
house until we nail Romero.

35:48.195 --> 35:51.446
He probably knows we can keep
him from boarding a plane, right?

35:51.481 --> 35:53.114
Yeah, and he doesn't own a car.
It leaves trains and buses.

35:54.049 --> 35:57.211
He still has that unused bus ticket.

36:14.588 --> 36:16.971
- I'll check out the buses.
- I'll check inside.

36:22.062 --> 36:23.811
<i>All Southbound passengers,</i>

36:23.847 --> 36:26.648
<i>please proceed to line 2 at gate 1.</i>

36:57.631 --> 36:59.264
Elliot.

36:59.299 --> 37:03.134
It's Jane.
We got to get you out of here.

37:03.136 --> 37:06.170
No.
I've got to get out of Boston.

37:06.206 --> 37:07.805
I can keep you safe.

37:10.610 --> 37:11.859
He could be anywhere.

37:11.895 --> 37:14.529
Listen to me, okay?
You're not alone.

37:14.564 --> 37:16.814
The department can
put you some place safe

37:16.816 --> 37:20.034
while we deal with Romero.
Okay, you don't have to run away.

37:20.070 --> 37:23.655
- What if you can't deal with him?
- I can deal with him.

37:28.061 --> 37:31.746
Hey, Korsak, I got Elliot with me.

37:31.798 --> 37:35.750
Uh, we're outside.
Just meet us at the car, okay?

37:35.802 --> 37:39.754
- That Hookah Bar smell.
- What? Here?

37:57.691 --> 37:59.824
Spencer Romero!
Police!

38:04.948 --> 38:07.749
You good?

38:07.784 --> 38:12.587
- Ask Detective Dutton.
- Detective?

38:12.622 --> 38:14.857
I didn't think screaming,
"hey, stop, I'm the guy who can't

38:14.858 --> 38:17.634
really recognize you,"
would be much help.

38:22.265 --> 38:25.933
<i>♪ We are not afraid ♪</i>

38:25.969 --> 38:28.636
<i>♪ of this hurricane ♪</i>

38:28.688 --> 38:31.639
<i>♪ we will stand like giants ♪</i>

38:31.691 --> 38:35.360
Janie.
What are you doing here?

38:35.395 --> 38:39.397
Well, Maura had said that you called,
so I came to say goodbye.

38:39.399 --> 38:44.819
- Wonderful. May I?
- Please.

38:47.240 --> 38:51.075
- Food good here?
- Oh, cut the crap, Carlo.

38:51.077 --> 38:53.077
Look, you may have gotten away

38:53.129 --> 38:56.330
with suing the funeral
parlor at Aunt Josie's funeral

38:56.383 --> 38:58.883
and mysteriously cutting
your fingertip off

38:58.918 --> 39:01.762
with a ladder at Kay's Hardware,
but you and I both

39:01.763 --> 39:04.055
know your neck is fine.
All right?

39:04.090 --> 39:05.973
Really?
With the cervical collar?

39:06.009 --> 39:08.126
- Come on!
- Jane.

39:08.161 --> 39:12.013
- We're family.
- Maura is family.

39:12.065 --> 39:15.066
And when her father started
causing problems, I shot him.

39:15.101 --> 39:19.771
I understand that you have doubts, Jane,
but my neck does hurt.

39:19.823 --> 39:22.940
And Maura has insurance.
She'll be fine.

39:22.992 --> 39:26.077
You're an embarrassment
to this family. You n...

39:26.112 --> 39:28.696
Jane.
I didn't expect to see you.

39:28.748 --> 39:30.998
Yeah, I was just having
a little chat with Carlo.

39:31.034 --> 39:33.034
Okay, Carlo.

39:33.086 --> 39:35.787
After you called,
I wanted to meet with you

39:35.789 --> 39:38.339
and give you a chance
to do the right thing.

39:38.374 --> 39:40.925
What can I say?
I hurt my neck.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.261
Okay.

40:07.320 --> 40:11.122
- See you at Christmas.
- Don't threaten me.

40:18.748 --> 40:22.834
Ehh, nice job
with the hidden camera.

40:22.886 --> 40:25.920
Well, I am trusting, but I'm not stupid.

40:25.972 --> 40:28.089
Well, why didn't you
tell me you put one up?

40:28.141 --> 40:30.007
Because I wanted to be right about him.

40:30.059 --> 40:32.343
It's not easy to admit that I'm right.

40:32.395 --> 40:34.812
- Sometimes.
- All the time.

40:34.848 --> 40:37.014
Okay, a lot.

40:37.066 --> 40:40.818
You know, slip-and-fall scam
artists typically work in teams.

40:40.854 --> 40:44.021
- He was very talented.
- Ugh.

40:44.023 --> 40:45.439
Can't even believe
you're giving him props.

40:45.492 --> 40:47.525
I'm just saying artists
come in all forms.

40:47.527 --> 40:51.863
<i>Hmm.
Unh-unh.</i>

40:51.915 --> 40:53.865
Are you are eating purse zeppole?

40:53.867 --> 40:57.201
- He does do one thing right.
- Give me one!

41:02.926 --> 41:05.960
These are really just
Italian doughnut holes.

41:06.012 --> 41:08.346
- How dare you?
- I'm not saying they're bad.

41:08.381 --> 41:10.464
"Not bad?"

41:10.517 --> 41:12.383
You don't deserve them.
Give them to me.

41:12.435 --> 41:16.938
- No, no way. I saved them.
- Give them to me.

41:20.727 --> 41:23.477
Why are you staring
at me like that again?

41:24.981 --> 41:26.814
I dare you to blink.

41:26.866 --> 41:29.283
Blink.

41:29.319 --> 41:31.118
<i>Blink.</i>

41:31.154 --> 41:33.154
If you squint really hard like this,
you don't blink.

41:33.206 --> 41:35.122
Blink.
Oh, god!

41:35.158 --> 41:37.158
- So easy.
- Don't eat all of them, please!

41:37.210 --> 41:39.334
I'm going to eat all of them.
