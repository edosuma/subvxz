WEBVTT

00:17.101 --> 00:19.061
Previously on Beacon 23.

00:19.478 --> 00:22.148
[man] Something visited
Beacon 23 a few years ago.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.816
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

00:23.899 --> 00:25.818
[woman] Is this about
the first beacon keeper?

00:25.901 --> 00:28.654
That thing she saw,
the artifact?

00:28.738 --> 00:30.823
Why all the secrecy
about some lost comet?

00:30.906 --> 00:32.031
[man]
That's not what it is at all.

00:32.116 --> 00:34.493
It's a vessel.

00:34.577 --> 00:36.328
An engine...

00:36.412 --> 00:39.165
An energy source.
I don't know, to be honest.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.167
But I do know
it's the key.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.210
Uniting human consciousness.

00:43.294 --> 00:46.046
Don't you wanna know
why you're having visions?

00:46.130 --> 00:47.548
-Visions?
-Yeah.

00:47.631 --> 00:48.674
That's what
we're calling them?

00:48.758 --> 00:50.342
-You see this, right?
-Yeah.

00:50.426 --> 00:52.470
Tell me I'm not imagining it.

00:54.096 --> 00:56.015
[man]
It's all about the rocks.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.224
[grunting]

00:59.602 --> 01:01.312
[Aster]
It's not a lie, Halan.

01:03.189 --> 01:04.482
It's all connected.

01:10.780 --> 01:13.115
[theme music]

01:48.651 --> 01:51.277
[Bart]
It's scary times out there.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.948
I heard someone blew up
Beacon 24.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.952
Is that true?
Why would someone do that?

01:59.036 --> 02:00.830
Wish I could help,
but I don't got a clue.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.456
I heard it was sabotage.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.083
Yeah, well, this patch
oughta protect you

02:04.166 --> 02:06.335
from whatever
they hit Beacon 24 with.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.294
That is a relief.

02:09.380 --> 02:11.799
They say they got in through
an exploit in the software.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.969
To destroy a beacon,
of all things.

02:16.846 --> 02:19.807
Something that functions
only to protect.

02:20.850 --> 02:23.269
Even in name,
a beacon is a source

02:23.352 --> 02:25.353
of hope and safety
for all who pass.

02:27.857 --> 02:30.693
I simply can't fathom why.

02:30.776 --> 02:34.321
Guess people don't need much
of an excuse to blow stuff up.

02:34.405 --> 02:36.281
I can't explain it either.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.534
I was hoping you'd try
before you left.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.536
-[whirring]
-It's not my department.

02:40.619 --> 02:42.829
No?
I only ask

02:42.913 --> 02:45.124
because you just finished
attaching an explosive

02:45.207 --> 02:46.667
to my quantum servers.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.880
I don't know what's going on
with your software,

02:50.963 --> 02:53.465
-but that's just bent.
-When your timer runs out,

02:53.549 --> 02:55.341
this beacon will detonate.

02:55.426 --> 02:57.636
You could at least do me
the courtesy of explaining

02:57.720 --> 02:59.889
why you're choosing
to end my existence.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.807
I assume you're part
of the Column?

03:01.891 --> 03:03.642
They've claimed responsibility

03:03.726 --> 03:05.895
for the destruction
of Beacon 24.

03:05.978 --> 03:09.356
Nothing personal, just politics.
Stuff I can't explain.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.361
-[groaning]
-Perhaps to you,

03:14.445 --> 03:16.322
I seem like any other
machine intelligence,

03:16.405 --> 03:17.823
but I'm not.

03:17.907 --> 03:19.825
For example,
I know a great deal

03:19.909 --> 03:22.244
about what you refer to
as the relics.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.498
The central precepts
of the Column

03:26.582 --> 03:29.043
are built around them,
are they not?

03:29.126 --> 03:32.171
The relics are used
to recruit new members?

03:32.254 --> 03:33.422
People sign up
when they see 'em.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.174
I know I did.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.259
I have more direct knowledge
of the relics

03:37.343 --> 03:38.677
than anyone in the Column,

03:38.761 --> 03:41.055
possibly more
than anyone, period.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.185
Wouldn't new information
about the relics

03:46.268 --> 03:48.562
be beneficial
to your organization?

03:48.646 --> 03:50.856
I got a meet-up,
I can't be late.

03:50.940 --> 03:52.691
But this knowledge is powerful

03:52.775 --> 03:54.610
and could change everything
for your group.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.070
It won't take long.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.072
It begins almost
two centuries ago,

03:58.155 --> 04:01.200
a time of great promise
and great danger...

04:01.283 --> 04:03.077
This doesn't sound
like a quick story.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.579
Make it fast.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.585
[Bart, voice-over]
"I was born under a lucky star",

04:11.669 --> 04:14.421
one might say,
if the closest star

04:14.505 --> 04:16.966
hadn't died
300 million years prior.

04:21.971 --> 04:25.557
My human counterpart
was Doctor Ree Avalon,

04:25.641 --> 04:27.434
Beacon 23's first Keeper.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.775
She was a human
of extraordinary ability.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.573
In the beginning,
I had no name or personality.

04:41.657 --> 04:44.034
I was merely
an operating system.

04:45.159 --> 04:49.331
Later, Avalon told me
she did not choose an avatar

04:49.415 --> 04:52.459
because she felt the beacon
itself was my truest form.

04:53.836 --> 04:55.671
I appreciated that notion.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.090
Congratulations,
Doctor Avalon.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.759
On behalf of ISA,
the space guilds,

05:00.843 --> 05:02.803
and our corporate sponsors,

05:02.886 --> 05:06.432
I am so grateful to welcome
you onboard this beacon.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.518
[man] QTA is proud
to have partnered with ISA

05:09.601 --> 05:13.105
to develop the first
dark matter detection system.

05:13.188 --> 05:17.109
But it is to you, the Keepers,
that we offer our humble thanks.

05:17.192 --> 05:21.488
You open the door to a future
of ever-expanding prosperity.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.951
[Bart, voice-over] Avalon grew
up in a coastal area,

05:26.035 --> 05:27.953
one of the last humans
I would meet

05:28.037 --> 05:30.330
who was actually born on Earth.

05:35.377 --> 05:39.339
For her, space was
the grandest of oceans.

05:45.304 --> 05:48.348
Growing up near a lighthouse
gave her a sense of duty.

06:00.444 --> 06:03.072
[creaking]

06:03.155 --> 06:04.865
[whirring]

06:19.421 --> 06:21.006
With the beacon up and running,

06:21.090 --> 06:24.843
we were excited to make sure
all systems were online.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.721
[alarm blaring]

06:33.644 --> 06:34.603
Yes!

06:42.778 --> 06:44.613
[Bart]
Our first ship passing by.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.407
-We did it.
-[Bart] A time for celebration.

06:51.370 --> 06:54.289
That picture you placed in
the Cupola of the lighthouse...

06:54.373 --> 06:56.917
There's something about keeping
a lamp lit in the darkness,

06:57.000 --> 06:59.711
to help strangers
you hope you never meet.

06:59.795 --> 07:03.549
-It inspired me.
-What a noble sentiment.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.175
Thank you, Bartholomew.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.264
Bartholomew.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.266
No, that is too long.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.226
I'm gonna call you Bart.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.395
A nickname!
Wonderful.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.231
-Did you see that?
-See what?

07:19.314 --> 07:21.567
Wait, something just flew
past us, Bart.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.193
My sensors detected nothing.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.499
[Bart, voice-over]
Avalon methodically sifted

07:37.582 --> 07:39.960
through the recordings
of the external cameras,

07:40.043 --> 07:44.006
searching for any trace
of our mysterious visitor.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.592
Despite my assertion
that there was nothing

07:46.675 --> 07:48.302
recorded by my sensors,

07:48.385 --> 07:50.137
she refused to give up
the search.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.815
[foghorn sounding]

08:17.706 --> 08:20.209
-Bart?
-Yes, Avalon?

08:20.292 --> 08:22.294
Did you hear the foghorn?

08:22.377 --> 08:24.671
A foghorn?
No.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.858
There! Right there!

08:44.942 --> 08:46.068
What is it?

08:47.319 --> 08:48.695
How do you not see it?

08:50.614 --> 08:52.574
Are you recording this?

08:52.658 --> 08:55.244
My sensors aren't detecting
any anomalous objects

08:55.327 --> 08:56.745
in the vicinity of the beacon.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.249
But it's right there.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.050
[Bart, voice-over]
The cameras captured nothing.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.346
[Bart] Are you certain
it wasn't a trick of the light?

09:14.429 --> 09:17.432
No, it wasn't the light,
or a reflection.

09:17.516 --> 09:21.270
It's impossible that my sensors
would fail to detect an object.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.064
Well, that's my point, Bart.
There's some discrepancy here.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.401
Okay, the antenna looks great.
Fire it up.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.603
[Bart, voice-over]
Avalon started having visions.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.982
She would then describe them
in great detail.

10:07.065 --> 10:10.235
I knew she was relating
her experiences truthfully,

10:10.319 --> 10:12.154
which concerned me even more.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.088
[gasps]

10:30.172 --> 10:31.757
[groans]

10:31.840 --> 10:35.635
[alarm blaring]

10:38.513 --> 10:40.932
Bart! That is so loud!

10:41.016 --> 10:43.435
I'm sorry.
The pH in the algae vats is low.

10:43.518 --> 10:44.936
I didn't know how else
to get your attention.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.688
It couldn't wait?
I saw it again.

10:46.772 --> 10:49.316
Doctor, you've been
in the Cupola for 27 hours.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.527
You've been neglecting
your duties.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.112
[pen clicking]

10:54.196 --> 10:55.655
This is more important.

10:57.532 --> 10:59.201
Have you considered
the possibility

10:59.284 --> 11:01.286
that the phenomenon
is a hallucination?

11:01.370 --> 11:02.662
[sighs]

11:02.746 --> 11:05.207
It is the most likely
explanation.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.667
When the object appears,
what do you see?

11:07.751 --> 11:09.086
Nothing, Doctor.

11:10.879 --> 11:13.340
But what does "nothing"
look like to you?

11:15.592 --> 11:17.969
[Bart, voice-over]
Her question occupied me.

11:18.053 --> 11:21.139
Every micron of space
is detectable.

11:21.223 --> 11:24.810
Background radiation,
radio waves, even dark matter,

11:24.893 --> 11:27.229
there's almost always
data to record.

11:27.312 --> 11:31.817
But atoms are small,
and space constantly expands.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.152
There will be tiny areas
where "nothing"

11:34.236 --> 11:36.154
is the only accurate reading.

11:36.238 --> 11:40.700
However, those empty spots
should be truly random.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.872
For days,
she stayed by the windows

11:45.956 --> 11:47.540
waiting for it to reappear.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.715
[sighs]

12:07.477 --> 12:09.855
[sighs]

12:09.938 --> 12:11.231
[groans]

12:19.948 --> 12:21.408
Bart?

12:21.491 --> 12:22.951
Yes, Avalon?

12:29.458 --> 12:31.710
Orient all your sensors
to follow my line of sight!

12:31.793 --> 12:33.128
Yes, Doctor.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.762
What are you reading?

12:42.846 --> 12:45.557
The area corresponding
to your line of sight

12:45.640 --> 12:47.809
is detecting negative space.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.604
Keep tracking.
Record all the coordinates.

13:08.705 --> 13:14.211
Bart, project a moduli space
encompassing these points.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.676
I knew there was a way
for you to see it.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.554
You have made
an unprecedented discovery.

13:26.515 --> 13:30.477
No, Bart.
We have, together.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.022
Doctor, our data sample
is still quite small.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.775
Even if you could determine
where it will appear,

13:36.858 --> 13:38.693
you couldn't possibly
determine when.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.155
-I know when it's coming back.
-How?

13:44.866 --> 13:48.119
I... I just know.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.497
You have to trust me.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.165
Your perceptions are not
empirically supported.

13:57.712 --> 13:58.755
There.

14:00.799 --> 14:03.301
When the time comes,
I'll be ready.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.053
Ready for what?

14:49.764 --> 14:52.225
Avalon, stop.
Wake up!

14:54.769 --> 14:56.396
You are not equipped for space.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.247
If you make an unauthorized EVA,

15:14.331 --> 15:16.249
I will be forced
to send a report.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.376
You will likely be removed
from this post.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.755
I am the Beacon Keeper.
I have my space suit on now,

15:21.838 --> 15:24.299
and I'm taking the Picker to
study an important phenomenon.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.926
Whatever it is, we can
study it from afar.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.723
I would like your faith, Bart.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.767
But I expect your
full cooperation.

15:35.226 --> 15:38.063
I will always
follow protocol, Doctor.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.356
Thank you.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.494
I just hope I'm not
too late to save it.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.828
Save what?

16:02.837 --> 16:04.297
[gasps]

16:10.512 --> 16:13.098
Avalon, turn around!

16:13.181 --> 16:15.642
You told me that we both
have limitations.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.853
That's why
we're better together.

16:18.937 --> 16:21.481
Come back, please.
Avalon!

16:24.359 --> 16:25.527
Where are you?

16:26.736 --> 16:27.737
Avalon?

16:29.948 --> 16:32.784
[Bart, voice-over] I scanned
the sector thousands of times,

16:32.867 --> 16:35.954
but she was gone,
as if she was never there.

16:36.037 --> 16:38.164
I tried to understand
this mystery,

16:38.248 --> 16:39.999
but in the end, I could not.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.626
My data was incomplete.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.045
[Bart] Without a Keeper,
I could no longer justify

16:44.129 --> 16:47.465
using my processing power
to search for the Artifact.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.801
I had to ensure the safety
of passing ships...

16:49.884 --> 16:52.721
And you're doing great.
But...

16:54.639 --> 16:58.351
-Tell me about the relics.
-It's quite simple, really.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.395
I have reason to believe
that the Artifact,

17:00.478 --> 17:02.188
which I could not perceive,

17:02.272 --> 17:04.523
is the source
of your so-called relics.

17:06.151 --> 17:08.737
Do you... do you have any?

17:08.819 --> 17:11.740
Are there relics
on the beacon?

17:11.823 --> 17:13.700
If you listen
to the rest of my story,

17:13.782 --> 17:15.910
I'll explain everything.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.163
Would you like to come up
to the Living Quarters?

17:18.246 --> 17:20.665
I can offer you
food and drink.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.500
I'm gonna be late
for my rendezvous.

17:22.584 --> 17:25.170
I do hope you're not
meeting your fellow bomber.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.046
What?

17:27.130 --> 17:30.258
The woman who planted
the bomb on Beacon 24.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.429
She died when her ship was hit
by shrapnel from the explosion.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.476
Did you know her?

17:43.855 --> 17:47.275
[sniffling]

17:54.324 --> 17:56.075
[sniffling]

18:12.217 --> 18:14.469
This is beer?

18:14.552 --> 18:19.390
I regret I've run out of dyes
and other aesthetic enhancers.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.935
My last Keeper departed
almost ten years ago.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.314
I'm sorry about your friend.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.569
She must have believed
in the Column's goals

18:31.653 --> 18:34.656
very strongly to be willing
to sacrifice her life for them.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.287
You ever read Okun?

18:41.371 --> 18:44.624
Marcel Okun.
The socio-futurist.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.960
Yes, I'm familiar
with his work.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.796
Yeah, she...

18:51.506 --> 18:53.758
She got me into his stuff.

18:53.842 --> 18:57.262
The belief that humanity's
evolutionary purpose

18:57.345 --> 19:00.139
is demonstrated within society.

19:00.223 --> 19:04.602
Yeah, because...
humans are social, right?

19:04.686 --> 19:08.606
So, we exist only in our
relationships with each other.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.568
We mean something
when we're connected.

19:13.111 --> 19:17.991
If we keep expanding,
we won't know who we are,

19:18.074 --> 19:20.785
and soon, it won't even
be up to us.

19:20.869 --> 19:25.164
It'll be corporations, AI,
whoever makes the decisions.

19:25.248 --> 19:27.792
At some point,
it'll be too late.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.711
Be too late to change it.

19:31.713 --> 19:36.134
We just need to...
come together, I don't know.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.511
-Come back together.
-May I ask,

19:38.595 --> 19:40.972
are you prepared to die
for a cause

19:41.055 --> 19:42.640
you don't
entirely understand?

19:42.724 --> 19:44.726
Wow, you're tricky, Bart!

19:44.809 --> 19:47.061
You're tricky!

19:47.145 --> 19:49.188
No trick is intended.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.858
But wouldn't you better
serve the Column

19:51.941 --> 19:54.903
by carrying information
back to them about the relics?

19:54.986 --> 19:57.363
Except you haven't
told me shit!

19:58.573 --> 19:59.866
Have you?

20:02.285 --> 20:05.538
The Column believes
the relics contain a warning

20:05.622 --> 20:08.708
from an alien civilization,
correct?

20:10.251 --> 20:13.379
-Your point?
-The Artifact I spoke of,

20:13.463 --> 20:16.507
it didn't just appear
and disappear.

20:16.591 --> 20:18.217
It attempted to communicate.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.846
-With you?
-No.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.849
With another inhabitant
of the beacon.

20:24.933 --> 20:27.018
If I continue my story...

20:27.101 --> 20:30.063
Oh! Swear you're gonna tell me
something useful?

20:30.146 --> 20:32.607
I promise.
The next part of the story

20:32.690 --> 20:34.901
will answer all your questions.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.488
You're lucky
this beer is good.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.408
[Bart, voice-over]
The regulations regarding

20:42.492 --> 20:44.202
Beacon Keepers
changed over the decades.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.620
[panting]

20:48.289 --> 20:51.250
Many advocated for the removal
of human Keepers,

20:51.334 --> 20:53.753
but ISA and the unions
were against that.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.591
After some unfortunate
experiences

20:58.675 --> 21:00.635
with solitary Keepers,

21:00.718 --> 21:03.137
couples were allowed to be
jointly assigned to beacons.

21:07.225 --> 21:09.477
If they were a romantic pair,
however,

21:09.560 --> 21:11.980
they had to prove
their infertility.

21:12.063 --> 21:15.984
ISA rules about procreation
were very strict and complex

21:16.067 --> 21:17.485
in regards to Beacon Keepers.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.615
You're gonna love
this new drone, Bart.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.075
[Bart]
A Theta series!

21:24.158 --> 21:25.660
I didn't even know
they were available.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.870
Top of the line.
They last forever.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.009
Bart, do you see that?

21:41.092 --> 21:42.969
-See what?
-[woman] Farut?

21:58.234 --> 21:59.819
[Bart] If you wish
to have the child,

21:59.902 --> 22:01.988
you must resign your post.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.198
Otherwise, termination
is your only option.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.287
Sustaining human population
is vital, Bart.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.913
Of course, I agree.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.500
But ISA regulations are clear.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.548
If there was an accident,
and one of the survivors

22:20.631 --> 22:23.968
was a child, we'd rescue him,
bring him on board.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.804
I will relay a message
to headquarters

22:26.888 --> 22:31.059
-explaining the situation.
-There is nothing to explain.

22:31.142 --> 22:34.020
We were medically assessed.
We met the criteria.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.606
And now, against all odds,
I'm pregnant.

22:40.651 --> 22:44.363
We will continue to do our jobs,
and you will continue to report

22:44.447 --> 22:46.866
everything that affects
the function of the beacon.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.035
Nothing more.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.245
They will find out
when your assignment ends.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.331
They will arrest you.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.041
They might even take your child.

23:00.338 --> 23:02.507
We've got five years.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.218
We can figure out
how to smuggle a little boy

23:05.301 --> 23:06.803
or girl off a beacon.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.806
How hard can it be?

23:11.933 --> 23:14.018
A girl.

23:14.102 --> 23:15.561
The child will be a girl.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.690
[Bart, voice-over]
I had no idea how profoundly

23:19.774 --> 23:22.527
this developing human life
would change me.

23:22.610 --> 23:25.071
[Bart]
Where on earth could she be?

23:25.154 --> 23:27.281
-[gasps, screams]
-Oh!

23:27.365 --> 23:28.908
Oh, where did she go?

23:31.327 --> 23:32.787
I see you!

23:32.870 --> 23:34.789
[gasps]
Come and get me!

23:34.872 --> 23:37.917
There she is, I see her!
Oh, she is so fast!

23:42.296 --> 23:44.006
[gasps]

23:46.676 --> 23:49.637
Oh no!
She disappeared again!

23:52.473 --> 23:53.933
[giggling]

23:56.644 --> 23:59.397
Aha! I found you!

23:59.480 --> 24:01.065
[giggling]

24:01.149 --> 24:02.400
[Bart, voice-over]
As their five-year assignment

24:02.483 --> 24:04.610
was nearing its end,
Grisha and Parsim

24:04.694 --> 24:06.279
planned to avoid ISA

24:06.362 --> 24:08.781
by leaving on a supply ship
a few months early.

24:08.865 --> 24:10.575
Seklir 8?

24:10.658 --> 24:13.661
They say the drinking water
there tastes like graphene.

24:13.744 --> 24:16.122
So, you'd rather
violent protests?

24:16.205 --> 24:17.748
Of course not.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.750
Because that's what's
happening on Baruni.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.752
It's maddening.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.963
If those people
were so against expansion,

24:24.046 --> 24:26.007
why did they move to a colony
in the first place?

24:27.717 --> 24:30.136
Seklir 8 is stable.
It's our best choice.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.048
[Bart, voice-over]
Prior to her leaving,

25:07.131 --> 25:10.092
I couldn't understand the human
expression "I'll miss you."

25:13.387 --> 25:16.349
After all, how could absence

25:16.432 --> 25:19.018
be experienced when one
has memories to recall?

25:26.150 --> 25:29.904
[singing in the distance]

25:35.243 --> 25:38.079
[Parsim, singing]
"Em ot emoc, em ot emoc..."

25:39.247 --> 25:41.123
[continues singing]

25:49.757 --> 25:52.051
[Bart, voice-over] A few months
before their departure...

25:54.428 --> 25:58.975
Parsim began to exhibit behavior
that was unusual.

26:00.268 --> 26:02.728
[continues singing in gibberish]

26:21.706 --> 26:23.207
Bart, what is she singing?

26:23.291 --> 26:24.917
[Bart]
I am unable to translate.

26:25.001 --> 26:26.711
It is not any language
in my database.

26:26.794 --> 26:28.754
[continues singing in gibberish]

26:31.299 --> 26:32.925
Let's put the markers
away now, huh?

26:36.220 --> 26:38.431
Parsim, what did I just say?

26:38.514 --> 26:39.890
[continues singing in gibberish]

26:39.974 --> 26:42.852
Enough baby talk.
Time for dinner.

27:06.834 --> 27:09.920
[Bart, voice-over] While I do
not experience emotion per se,

27:10.004 --> 27:13.007
my own responses
to various circumstances

27:13.090 --> 27:14.800
have evolved over time.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.582
I saw it once before.

27:49.877 --> 27:51.545
Why didn't you tell me?

27:51.629 --> 27:53.881
It was before
Parsim was born.

27:53.964 --> 27:56.342
I thought I was seeing things.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.014
What is it, Farut?

28:03.474 --> 28:05.309
I don't know.

28:05.393 --> 28:08.354
But it's beautiful.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.191
[chuckling]

28:12.274 --> 28:13.859
Where did it just go?

28:47.977 --> 28:49.353
Parsim?

28:49.437 --> 28:50.938
Parsim, I need you to come
away from there, please.

28:51.021 --> 28:53.399
-No!
-Parsim!

29:02.825 --> 29:04.869
[Bart, voice-over] While Grisha
grew ever more concerned

29:04.952 --> 29:07.955
about the effect
of the Artifact on Parsim,

29:08.038 --> 29:12.084
Farut became convinced that
it was evidence of alien life.

29:14.295 --> 29:15.713
In all the years of expansion,

29:15.796 --> 29:17.214
we've never encountered
any alien life forms.

29:17.298 --> 29:19.258
Period. And now?

29:19.341 --> 29:21.427
[Bart] My sensors detect
no evidence of life,

29:21.510 --> 29:22.970
intelligent or otherwise.

29:23.053 --> 29:25.055
I must get a sample.

29:25.139 --> 29:27.057
I won't even get out
of the Picker.

29:27.141 --> 29:29.768
The risk is too great.
Think of your family.

29:29.852 --> 29:32.563
Do you understand what this
discovery would mean for us?

29:32.646 --> 29:33.981
We may even be able
to remain on the beacon.

29:34.064 --> 29:35.733
Our position would be secure.

29:35.816 --> 29:38.235
ISA would send
other scientists as well.

29:38.319 --> 29:39.737
Think about Parsim.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.447
What's this got to do
with Parsim?

29:41.530 --> 29:44.783
It would be impossible
to keep Parsim a secret.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.328
Your contract specifies
anything created

29:47.411 --> 29:49.580
on the beacon
is considered work product.

29:49.663 --> 29:52.625
That might include Parsim,

29:52.708 --> 29:54.960
and they would certainly
want to study her.

29:56.670 --> 29:58.422
Let's go, Parsim.
Come on.

29:58.506 --> 29:59.507
Sweetie.

30:01.884 --> 30:04.470
Get down from there, please.
That's enough.

30:04.553 --> 30:07.139
Hey! That's enough!

30:07.223 --> 30:08.766
Parsim!

30:08.849 --> 30:10.893
That's...
that's not safe, Parsim!

30:12.686 --> 30:16.524
Okay, honey...
Please.

30:16.607 --> 30:20.486
Okay.
Sweetheart, listen.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.279
I need you to come down
from there, okay?

30:22.363 --> 30:23.614
-Can you just please--
-No!

30:23.697 --> 30:25.407
[grunts]
Parsim!

30:40.548 --> 30:42.424
-Okay.
-[groans]

30:47.638 --> 30:49.807
That thing is making her sick.

30:49.890 --> 30:53.561
She wasn't
like this before, Farut.

30:53.644 --> 30:56.480
-We need to leave.
-We are leaving, remember?

30:56.564 --> 30:58.857
Not in four months. Now.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.693
I can't make the supply ship
get here any faster.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.486
Then find someone else.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.321
Send a message
to the hydrogen station

31:04.405 --> 31:06.657
-to tell them that we'll pay.
-The only people

31:06.740 --> 31:08.701
we're going to get that way
are smugglers or wreckers.

31:08.784 --> 31:10.536
-Then that's what we get.
-Listen to yourself.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.830
How many times
have we had to sedate her?

31:12.913 --> 31:15.207
She is not gonna make it
another four months!

31:15.291 --> 31:17.751
We will be charged
with dereliction of duty.

31:17.835 --> 31:19.878
-I don't care.
-You don't care?

31:19.962 --> 31:22.756
We'll never work for ISA,
or for anyone for that matter.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.049
We'll be fugitives!

31:24.133 --> 31:25.384
And you can forget
about Seklir 8.

31:25.467 --> 31:26.844
We'd be lucky to bribe
our way to Menelaus.

31:26.927 --> 31:28.887
Is that what you want?
For us?

31:30.431 --> 31:31.599
For her?

31:33.934 --> 31:35.394
[sighing]

31:40.357 --> 31:41.734
It's only a few months.

31:43.277 --> 31:44.820
We can get through this.

32:01.003 --> 32:02.504
You lied for those people.

32:04.632 --> 32:06.383
I didn't know AI could do that.

32:06.467 --> 32:08.969
[Bart]
I have programming, of course,

32:09.053 --> 32:13.057
but I'm affected by others,
and learn from my experiences,

32:13.140 --> 32:15.434
including this experience
with you.

32:16.810 --> 32:19.938
Likewise, I've observed Grisha
doing everything she could

32:20.022 --> 32:21.148
to keep Parsim
from the Artifact.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.401
[Bart, voice-over]
She was concerned.,

32:24.485 --> 32:26.362
afraid of its effect
on her daughter...

32:28.238 --> 32:31.283
as Parsim's behavior
became ever more erratic.

32:41.752 --> 32:44.630
[Parsim screaming in video]

32:46.173 --> 32:49.760
[Parsim screaming]

32:49.843 --> 32:51.303
[Bart, in video] Don't worry
about the window, Parsim.

32:51.387 --> 32:54.098
Come!
Play a game with me!

32:54.181 --> 32:56.600
-Who wants to hide?
-[Parsim screaming]

32:56.684 --> 32:59.103
I'm ready to seek!

32:59.186 --> 33:01.438
Come on, I'm sure
there's plenty of places

33:01.522 --> 33:03.357
we haven't found to hide yet.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.942
[screaming]

33:05.025 --> 33:05.818
Parsim?

33:07.361 --> 33:08.487
Parsim!

33:22.793 --> 33:24.378
[Bart, voice-over]
Though the reports detailing

33:24.461 --> 33:27.005
Doctor Avalon's mental decline
were classified...

33:29.049 --> 33:30.676
Grisha found her way to them.

33:33.053 --> 33:35.180
You didn't think
this was important?

33:35.264 --> 33:37.474
[Bart] I alerted you
to all my concerns.

33:37.558 --> 33:40.644
Repeated hallucinations,
attempting to leave the beacon.

33:40.728 --> 33:43.814
I told you everything possible
given your security clearance.

33:43.897 --> 33:46.483
I don't care about
security clearance!

33:46.567 --> 33:48.652
She is my daughter!

33:48.736 --> 33:51.613
-No more secrets!
-I'm sorry, Grisha.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.503
[Bart, voice-over]
Farut was completely absorbed

34:06.587 --> 34:08.255
in the possibility
that the Artifact

34:08.338 --> 34:09.882
was evidence of alien life.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.309
He perused Avalon's notes.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.772
Over and over again,
he read them,

34:24.855 --> 34:27.065
adding his own calculations.

34:35.364 --> 34:38.786
He failed to notice that
the situation was deteriorating.

35:03.310 --> 35:05.521
[clattering]

35:22.037 --> 35:23.163
Parsim?

35:31.755 --> 35:33.841
[Parsim singing in gibberish]

35:43.058 --> 35:45.853
[continues singing in gibberish]

35:55.529 --> 35:57.698
Parsim?
Did you do that?

36:05.122 --> 36:08.333
[whispering in gibberish]

36:08.417 --> 36:10.460
[continues singing in gibberish]

36:10.544 --> 36:12.004
Hey.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.380
Whoa, Parsim!

36:13.463 --> 36:16.008
[continues singing in gibberish]

36:26.602 --> 36:27.686
Parsim?

36:33.567 --> 36:34.860
Parsim!

36:38.822 --> 36:40.866
Okay.
[sighs]

36:43.994 --> 36:45.370
That thing...

36:47.414 --> 36:50.208
It wants her, I know it.
It's trying to take her.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.921
What are you talking about?
That thing is alive?

36:55.255 --> 36:57.674
I don't know what it is, but...

36:57.758 --> 36:59.885
-It's sentient?
-I think so.

37:01.303 --> 37:03.764
-That's not possible.
-Oh no, it's true.

37:05.432 --> 37:07.100
And she can
communicate with it.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.852
You leave her out of this.

37:08.936 --> 37:12.022
Don't you see
what an opportunity this is?

37:12.105 --> 37:14.066
-What a gift!
-I am not going to let you

37:14.149 --> 37:17.945
-use our daughter as bait.
-Don't be a fool.

37:19.321 --> 37:22.074
This is bigger than any of us.

37:38.006 --> 37:41.093
[rhythmic music]

38:37.190 --> 38:39.026
[gasps]

38:43.530 --> 38:45.699
[Bart, voice-over]
I never saw the Artifact,

38:45.782 --> 38:48.160
but I saw the relics
come into existence.

38:49.911 --> 38:52.164
In that moment,
everything changed.

38:53.707 --> 38:56.752
What I couldn't perceive
was now visible.

38:57.794 --> 38:59.671
What else had I failed
to perceive

38:59.755 --> 39:02.174
that would reveal itself
in the sweep of time?

39:02.257 --> 39:04.301
[banging]
Hold on!

39:04.384 --> 39:07.137
Wait a minute.
You're telling me

39:07.220 --> 39:09.181
they blew up the Artifact?

39:11.558 --> 39:15.645
They found an alien Artifact,
and they just destroyed it?

39:15.729 --> 39:17.355
They had their reasons.

39:17.439 --> 39:20.358
And people seem to be willing
to blow things up, as you said.

39:20.442 --> 39:22.611
And you don't know what it said
to the little girl?

39:24.071 --> 39:25.697
If it communicated
anything to her,

39:25.781 --> 39:27.449
she did not relay it to me.

39:28.575 --> 39:31.870
Probably too young
to understand the message.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.747
Or there was no message.

39:34.831 --> 39:37.334
Are you open-minded enough
to consider that?

39:37.417 --> 39:38.627
[beeps]

39:46.426 --> 39:47.719
[Bart]
Who wants to hide?

39:50.472 --> 39:51.765
I'm ready to seek!

39:51.848 --> 39:53.975
[giggling]

40:02.484 --> 40:04.402
It was communicating with her.

40:04.486 --> 40:07.072
-It was hurting her.
-And now it's gone.

40:07.155 --> 40:10.367
You are so in love with the idea
of first contact.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.285
You want to learn
all the secrets of the universe.

40:12.369 --> 40:15.705
ISA is coming now, Grisha,
and it won't be months.

40:15.789 --> 40:17.249
The moment
that you fired that drone...

40:17.332 --> 40:19.042
I know.

40:19.126 --> 40:23.130
This will follow us, all of us,
for the rest of our lives.

40:23.213 --> 40:26.258
And if something
had happened to her, what then?

40:27.634 --> 40:28.760
Would our lives
even mean anything?

40:31.054 --> 40:34.349
Yours would no longer
mean anything to me.

40:39.563 --> 40:43.525
[giggling]

40:48.155 --> 40:49.823
[Bart, voice-over]
Because of Parsim's age,

40:49.906 --> 40:52.492
I knew she would fail
to form lasting memories

40:52.576 --> 40:54.327
of her time aboard the beacon.

41:02.752 --> 41:05.755
I suppose there was
some wish on my part

41:05.839 --> 41:07.799
that she would not
forget me entirely.

41:07.883 --> 41:09.509
As silly as that sounds.

41:09.593 --> 41:10.802
[Bart] Parsim?

41:12.179 --> 41:13.638
Special delivery!

41:32.199 --> 41:33.950
Thank you, Bart.

41:34.034 --> 41:36.244
That was very thoughtful.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.836
This is a gift
from your father and me.

41:46.796 --> 41:48.048
It's a new name.

41:49.382 --> 41:50.550
We've all got one now.

42:00.393 --> 42:02.187
So, whatever colony
they ended up on,

42:02.270 --> 42:04.898
it's probably collapsed by now.

42:04.981 --> 42:08.151
[Bart] Yes, the odds are better
than even that she died.

42:08.235 --> 42:10.695
But that... that's the problem.

42:10.779 --> 42:14.366
Colonies die
because of expansion.

42:14.449 --> 42:16.201
Yes.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.828
The questions you ask
about the value of expansion

42:18.912 --> 42:21.081
are too important
not to be debated.

42:22.499 --> 42:24.334
Damn, look at that,
I converted an AI.

42:24.417 --> 42:27.212
-[beeping]
-I didn't say I agree with you.

42:27.295 --> 42:29.172
I understand your position,

42:29.256 --> 42:31.383
and it should be
widely discussed.

42:31.466 --> 42:33.218
[beeps]

42:34.761 --> 42:36.554
Wait. Hold on.

42:36.638 --> 42:41.226
This... The Artifact
was blown to bits out there.

42:41.309 --> 42:44.229
Means there's probably
relics all around.

42:44.312 --> 42:47.399
-Yes.
-Can you... can you find them,

42:47.482 --> 42:49.025
tell me where they are?

42:49.109 --> 42:51.236
I'll be sure to tell
my next Keeper.

42:51.319 --> 42:53.822
[alarm blaring]

42:56.533 --> 42:58.410
What the hell?
That looks like an ISA ship.

42:59.661 --> 43:01.121
I informed the authorities

43:01.204 --> 43:02.747
as soon as you hailed
the beacon.

43:02.831 --> 43:04.416
Little shit!

43:05.959 --> 43:07.002
Dammit.

43:17.804 --> 43:20.223
Shit. Shit!

43:20.307 --> 43:23.101
[creaking, thudding]

43:41.328 --> 43:43.913
Coming for you, baby.
Wherever you are.

43:43.997 --> 43:45.957
[sniffling]

43:46.041 --> 43:48.710
-See you soon.
-You don't need to press that.

43:54.674 --> 43:56.634
[thudding]

43:57.886 --> 44:00.305
Doesn't matter anymore.

44:00.388 --> 44:01.806
[beeps]

44:04.017 --> 44:05.685
I knew who you were
when you boarded.

44:07.020 --> 44:08.646
The bomb was never armed.

44:10.357 --> 44:12.150
I performed an override.

44:16.571 --> 44:18.365
[thudding]

44:20.200 --> 44:21.659
So, I was right.

44:28.583 --> 44:32.295
This whole conversation
was just a stall!

44:32.379 --> 44:34.214
No.

44:34.297 --> 44:36.174
I meant every word I said.

44:37.759 --> 44:40.178
I hoped to convince you
not to do this,

44:40.261 --> 44:43.098
but I also wanted to learn.
And I did, Keir.

44:45.141 --> 44:47.018
I know you will be imprisoned,

44:47.102 --> 44:49.062
and I hope you will use
that time well,

44:49.145 --> 44:50.688
to develop your ideas.

44:53.233 --> 44:55.652
For my part,
I will encourage others

44:55.735 --> 44:57.195
to consider what you've told me.

44:59.239 --> 45:02.534
There is no weapon
as powerful as an idea.

45:02.617 --> 45:05.870
[dramatic music]
