WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.674
<i>Previously on "Faking It"...</i>

00:01.709 --> 00:05.794
You did the one thing
you knew I could never forgive.

00:05.796 --> 00:07.579
This is where you decide
whether or not

00:07.580 --> 00:08.797
- I'll be in your life anymore.
- Wait.

00:08.799 --> 00:10.499
- Was any of it real?
- No.

00:10.501 --> 00:11.883
You're done
with the art nonsense.

00:11.885 --> 00:14.720
You'll start an internship
at Skwerkel instead.

00:14.722 --> 00:16.838
You know Liam
did this, right?

00:16.840 --> 00:19.558
Apparently someone sent a link
of Duke's double account to TMZ.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.476
I am in love
with Shane Harvey.

00:21.478 --> 00:22.761
Thank you all for your support.

00:22.763 --> 00:25.058
I can't wait
to be your president.

00:25.766 --> 00:27.981
- Does this mean you forgive me?
- No.

00:34.942 --> 00:37.159
I love you.

00:38.829 --> 00:40.028
What are you doing?

00:40.030 --> 00:42.164
I'm sorry.
It just slipped out.

00:42.166 --> 00:43.615
How many times
do I have to tell you,

00:43.617 --> 00:45.834
we're just good buddies
who occasionally have sex.

00:45.836 --> 00:49.621
And if that's too confusing for
you, then maybe we should stop.

00:49.623 --> 00:50.922
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

00:50.924 --> 00:53.091
My mouth just forgot.

00:55.796 --> 00:57.012
[bleep].

00:57.014 --> 00:59.047
We're going to be late.

00:59.049 --> 01:01.266
To be continued.

01:03.354 --> 01:06.138
Just give me a sec.

01:08.942 --> 01:11.893
Lauren?
Are you okay?

01:11.895 --> 01:14.646
It's been two weeks since
you broke up with that boy.

01:14.648 --> 01:15.697
Who? What boy?

01:15.699 --> 01:18.200
Oh, that Theo guy?
I barely knew him.

01:18.202 --> 01:21.319
If that's true,
then why are you so angry?

01:21.321 --> 01:23.288
I'm not angry.
I'm stressed.

01:23.290 --> 01:25.240
As class president,
I'm now a role model,

01:25.242 --> 01:27.042
which means I can't be late.

01:27.044 --> 01:29.995
So tell Amy
she can take the bus.

01:29.997 --> 01:31.830
Amy!
You've got five seconds

01:31.832 --> 01:34.633
till I come up there
and drag you out of bed!

01:34.635 --> 01:36.385
I'm here. Jeez.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.336
If you want to ride with Lauren,
she just left.

01:38.338 --> 01:41.590
Oh, it's okay. Karma and Liam
are picking me up.

01:41.592 --> 01:45.010
Darling, I know I haven't
been the best model

01:45.012 --> 01:46.845
for healthy relationships,

01:46.847 --> 01:49.147
but even I can tell
that's a terrible idea.

01:49.149 --> 01:51.183
Karma and I spent the past two
weeks talking everything out,

01:51.185 --> 01:53.852
and she's totally forgiven me
for sleeping with Liam.

01:53.854 --> 01:55.320
I hope you're right.

01:55.322 --> 01:58.576
But if she comes at you
with a sharp object, run.

02:02.112 --> 02:05.247
♪ Walking down the sidewalk ♪

02:05.249 --> 02:09.451
♪ Is that the way
that you want to be seen? ♪

02:13.090 --> 02:14.956
Oh, is that Reagan?

02:14.958 --> 02:16.875
Let me guess.
Did she propose?

02:16.877 --> 02:18.343
Very funny.

02:18.345 --> 02:21.346
No, she texted a pic
from our camping trip.

02:21.348 --> 02:23.348
That's not at all
how I pictured it.

02:23.350 --> 02:25.684
Not that I pictured
anything.

02:28.388 --> 02:30.222
It was really nice of you
to drive us to school today.

02:30.224 --> 02:31.890
What can I say?

02:31.892 --> 02:33.525
I'm a good buddy.

02:33.527 --> 02:37.562
And plus, this way I can keep
an eye on you two.

02:39.399 --> 02:41.900
I am kidding, guys.
Jeez.

02:41.902 --> 02:43.618
I told you, I'm over it.

02:43.620 --> 02:46.071
Let it go.

02:46.073 --> 02:49.241
Karma, are you sure
you're over it?

02:49.243 --> 02:50.709
What?
Why do you ask?

02:50.711 --> 02:53.628
I just sense this edge
in your voice,

02:53.630 --> 02:55.547
and you're still not wearing
your friendship necklace.

02:55.549 --> 02:57.382
Oh, are we still
doing that?

02:57.384 --> 03:01.920
I mean, don't you think
they're a little childish?

03:01.922 --> 03:05.090
We are 16.
We've already been arrested.

03:05.092 --> 03:07.926
And we're not virgins anymore,
thanks to this guy.

03:07.928 --> 03:10.896
Trust me.
So over it.

03:12.816 --> 03:15.433
Look at me,
a professional MMA fighter

03:15.435 --> 03:18.436
holding hands in public
with a super-hot boyfriend.

03:18.438 --> 03:20.739
See? Stars...
they're just like us.

03:20.741 --> 03:24.109
It's almost like whoever
outed you did you a favor.

03:24.111 --> 03:27.662
Almost, except that bitter,
little dickwad didn't realize

03:27.664 --> 03:30.081
that when Cluck-N-Go dropped me,
Swiftly would come to my rescue.

03:30.083 --> 03:31.700
If I ever find out
who he is...

03:31.702 --> 03:34.369
Okay, Dukey,
save it for the ring.

03:34.371 --> 03:36.371
I'm sorry. You're right.

03:36.373 --> 03:38.623
You always know
how to talk me down.

03:44.882 --> 03:48.850
You okay? I'm being all shrimpy,
and you seem distracted.

03:48.852 --> 03:52.637
You're hiding something.
I think I know what it is.

03:52.639 --> 03:54.472
You do?

03:54.474 --> 03:55.807
Yeah. Lauren got elected
class president over you.

03:55.809 --> 03:59.444
She's played
the inter-sex card, okay?

03:59.446 --> 04:01.813
The school will turn on her
when they see her radical...

04:01.815 --> 04:03.031
agenda.

04:03.033 --> 04:05.367
All right, you're next.
Step forward, please.

04:06.787 --> 04:09.287
Student IDs, please.

04:09.289 --> 04:10.822
Uh, I threw mine away
last year.

04:10.824 --> 04:12.874
Horrible pic. I tried this new
eyebrow-raise thing,

04:12.876 --> 04:14.075
and it did not work.

04:14.077 --> 04:16.327
Penny, we got another one.

04:16.329 --> 04:18.413
It's okay.
This young man is a student.

04:18.415 --> 04:20.165
What about this yahoo?

04:20.166 --> 04:21.666
Uh, he's not a student.

04:21.668 --> 04:25.220
This is my professional
MMA fighter boyfriend.

04:25.222 --> 04:26.638
Now I've seen everything.

04:26.640 --> 04:29.307
Penelope,
what the [bleep] was that?

04:29.309 --> 04:31.059
I know. I'm sorry.

04:31.061 --> 04:32.677
Trust me,
I didn't hire him.

04:32.679 --> 04:33.979
Then who did?

04:33.981 --> 04:36.731
The new principal.

04:36.766 --> 04:41.186
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

04:41.221 --> 04:42.687
This is
a perfect opportunity

04:42.689 --> 04:44.656
to prop up your softening
poll numbers.

04:44.658 --> 04:47.692
What are you talking about?
People love me.

04:47.694 --> 04:50.412
People love the idea of you.
The reality? Not so much.

04:50.414 --> 04:51.780
Everyone had hopes

04:51.782 --> 04:54.366
that you would be a more
inspirational leader.

04:54.368 --> 04:56.751
Perhaps if you talked more
about being inter-sex.

04:56.753 --> 04:57.869
Zip.

04:57.871 --> 05:00.956
Okay, then talk
about how Theo betr...

05:00.958 --> 05:03.041
Zip.
We discussed this.

05:03.043 --> 05:05.093
Public figure,
private person.

05:05.095 --> 05:06.294
Okay.

05:06.296 --> 05:08.213
Then your only other option

05:08.215 --> 05:10.215
is to stand up
to this new principal.

05:10.217 --> 05:12.183
Rally the school
behind you.

05:12.185 --> 05:13.551
I'm sorry, Wendy.

05:13.553 --> 05:15.637
We'll have to pause
this conversation.

05:15.639 --> 05:18.390
Someone is sitting
at our table.

05:18.392 --> 05:19.724
Pipe down, Evita.

05:19.726 --> 05:22.444
There are no reserved tables
in the cafeteria.

05:22.446 --> 05:25.030
There are now.
I enacted the measure last week.

05:25.032 --> 05:27.565
So, if you don't mind...

05:28.631 --> 05:30.402
You know what, Lauren?
I'm so glad

05:30.404 --> 05:31.870
you have something
to cling to

05:31.872 --> 05:34.623
since Theo's tragic betrayal.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.492
But don't forget who really
calls the shots around here... me.

05:38.912 --> 05:40.629
Oh, Shane.

05:40.631 --> 05:43.048
Bitter really suits you.

05:45.836 --> 05:47.168
Hey.

05:47.170 --> 05:48.720
- Can we talk about Karma?
- Can we talk about Karma?

05:48.722 --> 05:50.388
- You go.
- You go. Ladies first.

05:50.390 --> 05:52.424
- I will cut you.
- Then I'll go first.

05:52.426 --> 05:54.976
Karma says that she's forgiven
us, but I don't think she has.

05:54.978 --> 05:57.929
I know. She called
these necklaces childish.

05:57.931 --> 05:59.898
Well, she has a point.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.266
Didn't you win them
playing Skee-Ball?

06:01.268 --> 06:03.268
No. It was the claw machine.

06:03.270 --> 06:05.070
Attention, all students,

06:05.072 --> 06:07.322
please make your way to the quad
for a mandatory assembly.

06:07.324 --> 06:08.823
- Ladies first.
- Ugh!

06:10.527 --> 06:13.828
Gandhi once said
the best way to find yourself

06:13.830 --> 06:15.447
is to lose yourself
in service.

06:15.449 --> 06:18.616
And I look forward to serving
you as Hester's new...

06:18.618 --> 06:21.536
Vice principal.

06:21.538 --> 06:23.672
As of today,
we have a new leader...

06:23.674 --> 06:25.290
Principal Turner.

06:25.292 --> 06:26.758
What's the deal?

06:26.760 --> 06:28.960
Thank you,
Vice Principal Beaver.

06:28.962 --> 06:30.462
It's Bevier.

06:30.464 --> 06:31.796
Kids, I'll be honest
with you.

06:31.798 --> 06:34.015
I am not
an inspirational leader.

06:34.017 --> 06:36.051
I'm not here to tell you
to dream big

06:36.053 --> 06:39.604
or reach for the stars
or any of that bullcrap.

06:39.606 --> 06:43.108
The recent drug bust
exposed a school

06:43.110 --> 06:45.110
with dangerously loose
academic standards

06:45.112 --> 06:47.028
and a complete disregard

06:47.030 --> 06:48.980
for how things are done
in the real world.

06:48.982 --> 06:50.398
I am here to fix that.

06:50.400 --> 06:52.617
Trust that it's for
your own good.

06:56.123 --> 06:58.406
Lauren Cooper,
sophomore class president.

06:58.408 --> 06:59.791
You must let me
give you a tour.

06:59.793 --> 07:01.626
And, no, I won't take no
for an answer.

07:01.628 --> 07:03.078
We got to stop this guy.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.163
Let's meet after school
and come up with a plan.

07:05.165 --> 07:07.499
Uh, I can't today.
I've got to go to the dentist.

07:07.501 --> 07:09.000
This is important.

07:09.002 --> 07:10.668
I heard he turned the art studio
into a storage room.

07:10.670 --> 07:11.920
And I'm really
upset about it.

07:11.922 --> 07:13.671
But he books up
weeks in advance.

07:13.673 --> 07:15.890
Penelope.

07:15.892 --> 07:17.475
That guy's going
to destroy everything

07:17.477 --> 07:18.843
this school stands for.

07:18.845 --> 07:20.395
You don't think
that I know that?

07:20.397 --> 07:22.680
But I barely kept my job,
and I have three cats to feed.

07:22.682 --> 07:24.482
I'm sorry.
There's nothing I can do.

07:24.484 --> 07:26.985
But if a certain
student leader

07:26.987 --> 07:29.354
were to rally the school
in protest.

07:29.356 --> 07:31.156
Okay, I'm blushing.
Stop.

07:31.158 --> 07:33.024
- I'll do it.
- You're gonna talk to Lauren.

07:33.026 --> 07:36.327
Thank you. I got to keep
my hands clean.

07:36.329 --> 07:37.779
You want to talk
about what's wrong?

07:37.781 --> 07:39.497
Well, let's see.

07:39.499 --> 07:42.367
Now I'm not just the girl
who lied about being a lesbian,

07:42.369 --> 07:44.536
I'm also the daughter
of the drug dealers

07:44.538 --> 07:45.837
who destroyed the school.

07:45.839 --> 07:48.506
- So fun.
- You're having feelings.

07:48.508 --> 07:49.924
How about I'll come over
after school

07:49.926 --> 07:51.626
and we'll eat them
together?

07:51.628 --> 07:53.711
Isn't today your mom's
meatless meat loaf Monday?

07:53.713 --> 07:56.598
Oh, uh, that got canceled.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.466
Mom's got
a really bad hangnail.

07:58.468 --> 07:59.934
It's infected.

07:59.936 --> 08:01.970
Trust me, you don't want
her hands in your food.

08:01.972 --> 08:03.221
Bye.

08:03.223 --> 08:04.939
Skwerkel Headquarters.
Please hold.

08:04.941 --> 08:07.392
- Hey, Liam!
- Hey, Janet.

08:07.394 --> 08:10.111
- How's your husband's bunion?
- Doctor says it isn't infected.

08:10.113 --> 08:12.897
Oh, good.
I was worried.

08:12.899 --> 08:15.116
We meet again,
young Jedi.

08:16.820 --> 08:19.070
I'll never join you
on the Dark Side.

08:19.072 --> 08:20.238
We'll see.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:29.166 --> 08:31.166
Nice move, Booker.

08:31.168 --> 08:32.801
Okay, back to work.

08:32.803 --> 08:35.303
You mean back to Skwerk.

08:35.304 --> 08:37.422
Hey, Yoda.

08:37.424 --> 08:39.256
Do you know where
the interns sit?

08:39.259 --> 08:42.644
Yeah. I do, because that
is where I sit.

08:42.645 --> 08:44.762
It's this way.

08:44.764 --> 08:46.147
My name's Liam.

08:46.149 --> 08:47.765
Zita.

08:47.767 --> 08:49.767
So, what brings you
to Skwerkel, Zita?

08:49.769 --> 08:51.686
Uh, last week I popped
the wrong pills

08:51.688 --> 08:53.104
and wrecked my dad's
precious Tesla.

08:53.106 --> 08:55.023
So it was either
an internship here

08:55.025 --> 08:56.691
or boarding school
in Florida.

08:56.693 --> 09:00.078
And not Miami.
Tampa.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.498
So here I am. Yay.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.782
Well, we're
in the same boat,

09:04.784 --> 09:06.501
'cause I, too,
am here against my will.

09:06.503 --> 09:08.920
Right.

09:10.457 --> 09:12.457
The school converted
the football field

09:12.459 --> 09:14.459
into an organic
vegetable garden.

09:14.461 --> 09:16.794
- You got to be kidding.
- That's just the beginning.

09:16.796 --> 09:19.097
They replaced AP calculus
with yarn arts.

09:19.099 --> 09:21.132
Everyone had to knit a sweater
for the final.

09:21.134 --> 09:24.552
I couldn't make
this shi... stuff up.

09:24.554 --> 09:25.970
Miss Cooper,

09:25.972 --> 09:28.056
you seem as horrified
by this place as I am.

09:28.058 --> 09:30.725
How were you possibly elected
president of your class?

09:30.727 --> 09:33.611
Because I've learned how
to manipulate these idiots.

09:33.613 --> 09:36.064
- And, boy, do you need my help.
- Oh, do I?

09:36.066 --> 09:37.649
You've got to get the students
on your side

09:37.651 --> 09:38.983
before there's a protest.

09:38.985 --> 09:41.374
Trust me, we're barely
in class as it is.

09:41.409 --> 09:46.708
_

09:46.743 --> 09:48.293
Hey, boo-boo.

09:48.295 --> 09:49.494
Miss me?

09:49.496 --> 09:51.996
Uh, Amy, what are you
doing here?

09:51.998 --> 09:55.466
Oh, well, it took me four years
to read <i>Fifty Shades,</i>

09:55.468 --> 09:58.336
and I figured
you'd want it back, stat.

09:58.338 --> 10:00.004
What is happening here?

10:00.006 --> 10:01.806
Where are all your things?
You love things.

10:01.808 --> 10:04.759
Uh, you know,
spring cleaning.

10:04.761 --> 10:06.594
Out with the old,
in with the new.

10:06.596 --> 10:09.013
Oh. Sorry.
I, um... I can come back.

10:09.015 --> 10:10.732
Why are you here now?
Who's this?

10:11.685 --> 10:15.019
Uh... Felix here

10:15.021 --> 10:16.854
is my new...

10:16.856 --> 10:19.240
GBF.

10:19.242 --> 10:21.659
He's helping me take
my wardrobe from drab to fab.

10:21.661 --> 10:23.161
Isn't that right, Felix?

10:23.163 --> 10:24.862
Yes, I am.

10:24.864 --> 10:26.197
And not only am I gay,

10:26.199 --> 10:28.249
I am also
a walking stereotype.

10:29.536 --> 10:31.035
Oh, you're
so dramatic, Felix.

10:31.037 --> 10:32.870
Uh, we have a lot
of work to do.

10:32.872 --> 10:35.206
So I will call you
tomorrow, yeah?

10:35.208 --> 10:36.541
But...

10:36.543 --> 10:39.043
Yeah.
All right. Bye.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.798
I can't believe you told her
I was gay.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.580
Do you think she bought it?

10:45.721 --> 10:47.201
Students of Hester High,

10:47.236 --> 10:48.577
there are certain
personal freedoms

10:48.612 --> 10:50.456
you will no longer
be able to enjoy.

10:50.491 --> 10:52.785
Are you tired of being treated
like a criminal?

10:52.820 --> 10:55.135
I'm Lauren Cooper,
and I feel the same way.

10:55.137 --> 10:57.354
I mean, what's the point
of having lockers

10:57.356 --> 10:59.389
if there are no doors on them,
am I right?

10:59.391 --> 11:01.975
We're not allowed to park
on campus anymore.

11:01.977 --> 11:04.978
And worst of all,
we have to carry these.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.480
It's inhumane.

11:06.482 --> 11:08.482
Why should all of us be punished
for the crimes of a few?

11:08.484 --> 11:10.534
That's why I worked
with Principal Turner

11:10.536 --> 11:14.538
to create Hester's
new Verified Program.

11:14.540 --> 11:18.826
Now I can drive to school
and use a normal backpack.

11:18.828 --> 11:21.044
I have all of the freedoms
I enjoyed before.

11:21.046 --> 11:22.996
And getting verified
is simple.

11:22.998 --> 11:24.498
Just sign
the new code of conduct,

11:24.500 --> 11:27.751
get fingerprinted,
and agree to random drug tests,

11:27.753 --> 11:29.553
because if we have
nothing to hide,

11:29.555 --> 11:31.054
what's the big deal?

11:31.056 --> 11:33.891
"What's the big deal"?
Is she serious?

11:33.893 --> 11:35.893
Hey, nobody's going
to fall for that.

11:35.895 --> 11:37.895
Congratulations.
You're verified.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.646
What is happening?

11:39.648 --> 11:41.932
Hey, Shane, have you met Karma's
new mysterious gay friend?

11:41.934 --> 11:44.401
Are you kidding me?
Is he full of witty retorts?

11:44.403 --> 11:46.987
How's his fashion sense?
Is he cute? Cuter than me?

11:46.989 --> 11:49.523
I don't know.
I only met him once.

11:49.525 --> 11:50.774
- His name is Felix.
- Felix.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.993
Oh, the new guy
in my yarn arts class?

11:52.995 --> 11:55.662
Oh, thank God he's not gay.

11:55.664 --> 11:57.164
You're sure?

11:57.166 --> 11:59.783
Trust me.
My gaydar is 100% accurate.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.201
Well, with guys.

12:01.203 --> 12:03.170
If that's true, then why
would he fake being gay?

12:03.172 --> 12:05.088
Yeah. Who would do
such a terrible thing?

12:05.090 --> 12:07.207
He's Karma-ing Karma.

12:07.209 --> 12:09.960
He's pretending to be gay
so he can gain her trust

12:09.962 --> 12:11.428
and seduce her.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.213
Uh-huh.
Will you excuse me one second?

12:13.215 --> 12:15.015
Hi, Brenda.

12:15.017 --> 12:16.466
Thumbprint.

12:16.468 --> 12:18.635
Brenda, what the [bleep]?
You're getting verified?

12:18.637 --> 12:21.104
I'm sorry, Shane.
I just really need the parking.

12:21.106 --> 12:22.522
You should join her.
It's easy.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.608
Just click here to accept
the terms and conditions.

12:24.610 --> 12:27.245
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer to read them first.

12:27.916 --> 12:30.530
What?

12:30.532 --> 12:32.399
Have any of guys read this?

12:32.401 --> 12:34.701
This is longer than
my grandma's Christmas letter.

12:34.703 --> 12:36.403
They want us to play
by their rules.

12:36.405 --> 12:38.989
But Hester High has always been
about breaking the rules.

12:38.991 --> 12:40.874
We question tradition.
We trust each other.

12:40.876 --> 12:43.076
We stand up for the little guy.
Can I get an amen, Brenda?

12:43.078 --> 12:46.079
- Amen.
- You guys, there's no need

12:46.081 --> 12:48.165
for another silly protest.
They never work anyway.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.717
Maybe that's because
they've never been

12:50.719 --> 12:52.052
as epic as this one.

12:52.054 --> 12:54.471
Fellow students,
if Principal Turner

12:54.473 --> 12:56.256
wants to strip us
of our rights,

12:56.258 --> 12:59.309
then maybe we should strip
to protect them.

12:59.311 --> 13:02.262
Naked protest!
Naked protest!

13:02.264 --> 13:06.872
Naked protest! Naked protest!
Naked protest!

13:07.046 --> 13:08.804
And then, as if the day
wasn't bad enough,

13:08.839 --> 13:10.978
we had to use
the service elevator.

13:14.462 --> 13:15.661
Oh, son.

13:15.663 --> 13:17.246
I dropped by to tell you

13:17.248 --> 13:19.131
I heard you're doing great work,
and you're late.

13:19.133 --> 13:20.716
What are the odds?

13:20.718 --> 13:22.468
I was held up at school.

13:22.470 --> 13:26.923
Mm. Well, luckily, Zita's
been a delightful distraction.

13:30.595 --> 13:32.562
You didn't tell me
your dad was the CEO.

13:32.564 --> 13:34.263
He's kind of hot.

13:34.265 --> 13:36.516
What? It's true.

13:36.518 --> 13:38.434
You could tell
he'd be into it.

13:38.436 --> 13:41.153
- Oh!
- Sheesh. Such a prude.

13:41.155 --> 13:42.939
Trust me, not a prude.

13:42.941 --> 13:44.440
And stay far away
from that man.

13:44.442 --> 13:46.492
He eats children's souls
for breakfast.

13:46.494 --> 13:48.110
Wow.

13:48.112 --> 13:50.580
You really don't
like him.

13:50.582 --> 13:53.616
- Booker, Skwerking hard?
- Hardly Skwerking.

13:55.203 --> 13:57.336
These people actually
enjoy working here.

13:57.338 --> 13:59.956
- I can't piss all over that.
- Hmm.

13:59.958 --> 14:01.591
Well, if you really
hate it so much,

14:01.593 --> 14:04.210
then why are you here?

14:04.212 --> 14:05.545
That is a long story.

14:05.547 --> 14:08.214
Sounds juicy.
Take your time.

14:08.216 --> 14:10.967
Embellish the good parts.

14:10.969 --> 14:12.885
Oh, come on.
You can trust me.

14:12.887 --> 14:14.887
Who am I going to tell?
All my friends are in rehab.

14:14.889 --> 14:19.358
Okay.
Um, where do I begin?

14:19.360 --> 14:22.695
All right, Hester, when I say
"We have nothing to hide,"

14:22.697 --> 14:24.530
everyone take off
your clothes.

14:24.532 --> 14:26.198
N-U-D-E!

14:26.200 --> 14:28.701
You can't take my rights
from me!

14:28.703 --> 14:30.536
N-U-D-E!

14:30.538 --> 14:32.538
You can't take my rights
from me!

14:32.540 --> 14:33.539
N-U-D-E!

14:33.541 --> 14:35.658
You can't take my rights
from me!

14:35.660 --> 14:37.543
N-U-D-E!

14:37.545 --> 14:39.078
You can't take my rights
from me!

14:39.080 --> 14:40.463
- We need to talk.
- N-U-D-E!

14:40.465 --> 14:42.048
You can't take my rights
from me!

14:42.050 --> 14:45.134
Lauren, it's not too late.
Go tell them you made a mistake.

14:45.136 --> 14:46.552
But I didn't, Wendy.

14:46.554 --> 14:48.554
I support everything
Principal Turner is doing.

14:48.556 --> 14:50.806
You're not the same
candidate I voted for.

14:53.845 --> 14:55.261
- Lauren.
- What the [bleep]

14:55.263 --> 14:56.679
- are you doing here?
- You blocked my calls.

14:56.681 --> 14:58.180
I need to tell you
that I lied to you.

14:58.182 --> 15:00.399
Yeah, I know.
How stupid do you think I am?

15:00.401 --> 15:03.152
No. When you asked
if any of it was real,

15:03.154 --> 15:06.355
I only said no because
my boss was listening.

15:06.357 --> 15:08.157
I don't know what game
you're playing,

15:08.159 --> 15:10.326
but it's not
going to work.

15:11.863 --> 15:13.195
N-U-D-E!

15:13.197 --> 15:14.947
You can't take my rights
from me!

15:14.949 --> 15:17.750
All right, students!

15:17.752 --> 15:19.251
You have ten seconds
to disperse.

15:19.253 --> 15:21.253
After that,
everyone here

15:21.255 --> 15:23.339
will receive Saturday detention
for a month.

15:23.341 --> 15:25.207
Is he for real?

15:27.211 --> 15:29.345
I know you all
hate these new rules.

15:29.347 --> 15:30.880
A real politician
would get up here

15:30.882 --> 15:32.515
and tell you they hate them too,
but I won't pander,

15:32.517 --> 15:34.884
especially when that's not
how I feel.

15:34.886 --> 15:37.436
Hester isn't the same place
it used to be.

15:37.438 --> 15:40.389
Nobody knows that
better than me.

15:42.193 --> 15:45.853
We were humiliated.
We were used.

15:47.624 --> 15:49.899
We were betrayed.

15:51.486 --> 15:53.152
These rules are here
to protect us,

15:53.154 --> 15:56.405
because we can't let
our guard down like that again.

15:56.407 --> 15:59.158
Protect us from what, Lauren?

15:59.160 --> 16:01.243
We have nothing to hide.

16:07.835 --> 16:09.418
What the [bleep]?

16:09.420 --> 16:10.920
And even though
all she wants to be

16:10.922 --> 16:12.421
is friends with benefits
right now,

16:12.423 --> 16:14.640
I know that if I wait it out,
she'll forgive me.

16:14.642 --> 16:17.093
Mm, I hate
to be blunt, but...

16:17.095 --> 16:20.062
Actually, I love to be blunt,
because I speak the truth,

16:20.064 --> 16:22.264
and you need to hear it.
Give up.

16:22.266 --> 16:23.733
No, no, no.
You don't know her.

16:23.735 --> 16:25.735
I don't need to.
You screwed her best friend.

16:25.737 --> 16:27.236
Game over.
It's a lost cause.

16:27.238 --> 16:29.739
Not us, okay?
We have something special.

16:29.741 --> 16:32.024
Oh, Liam, how can be so rich
and so naïve?

16:33.494 --> 16:35.995
5:00.
We're free.

16:40.284 --> 16:41.617
Whoa. Hey, hey.

16:41.619 --> 16:44.170
I just had
to get you alone.

16:44.172 --> 16:45.454
I...

16:45.456 --> 16:47.339
can't stop thinking
about you.

16:47.341 --> 16:49.258
I get mistaken
for other people a lot.

16:49.260 --> 16:50.793
I have a pretty common face.

16:53.181 --> 16:54.797
Come on.

16:54.799 --> 16:56.932
Tell me you didn't feel
the connection

16:56.934 --> 16:58.601
between us last night.

16:58.603 --> 17:00.686
It was electric.

17:00.688 --> 17:02.805
It was?

17:02.807 --> 17:04.773
I mean, it was...

17:04.776 --> 17:06.008
so electric.

17:06.010 --> 17:08.194
But I thought
you were a lesbian.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.061
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

17:10.064 --> 17:12.481
I've never
labeled myself.

17:12.483 --> 17:14.900
I'm more attracted
to the person.

17:14.902 --> 17:17.319
And you are a person

17:17.320 --> 17:20.823
to whom I am definitely
attracted.

17:20.825 --> 17:23.325
And I think the feeling
is mutual.

17:23.327 --> 17:26.545
If only you weren't gay.

17:27.835 --> 17:29.665
Uh, yeah.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.967
Um, about that.

17:31.969 --> 17:34.170
What the [bleep]
is going on?

17:36.396 --> 17:39.916
Is it your goal to seduce
every guy in my life?

17:39.951 --> 17:41.482
Just when I thought
I could trust you again.

17:41.517 --> 17:45.253
You can. I was just exposing
Felix for the fraud that he is.

17:45.255 --> 17:47.589
He's straight.
He was only pretending to be gay

17:47.591 --> 17:50.759
- so he could seduce you.
- Whoa! What? Wait a second.

17:50.761 --> 17:52.477
I am straight, yeah.

17:52.479 --> 17:54.980
But I would never
do something like that.

17:54.982 --> 17:57.065
What kind of person would?

17:59.436 --> 18:01.486
Well, I can't believe

18:01.488 --> 18:02.821
you lied to me.

18:05.109 --> 18:07.242
Okay.
No, I'm sorry.

18:07.244 --> 18:08.694
I'm sorry, I can't go along
with this anymore.

18:08.696 --> 18:10.529
If you're not going
to tell her, then I will.

18:11.938 --> 18:13.782
Tell me what?

18:13.784 --> 18:16.668
Why I was in her bedroom
last night.

18:16.670 --> 18:18.954
Because...

18:18.956 --> 18:20.789
it's not my bedroom
anymore.

18:20.791 --> 18:22.624
It's his.

18:24.094 --> 18:25.460
There we go.

18:25.462 --> 18:28.130
I'm going to leave
you two alone.

18:30.968 --> 18:33.507
I don't understand.

18:35.305 --> 18:37.856
Since the drug bust,
we're broke...

18:37.858 --> 18:42.277
so broke that we had to rent out
our house to Felix's family.

18:42.279 --> 18:44.279
So we're basically homeless,
only we own a home.

18:44.281 --> 18:47.282
We just can't afford
to live in it.

18:48.485 --> 18:50.786
I'm sorry.
Why didn't you tell me?

18:50.788 --> 18:53.989
I'm living in the juice truck in
my backyard. It's humiliating.

18:53.991 --> 18:57.159
There's nothing humiliating
about it. It's not your fault.

18:57.161 --> 18:59.795
Now, those bangs you got
in fourth grade,

18:59.797 --> 19:01.496
that was humiliating.

19:02.833 --> 19:05.050
You can get through this,
but you have to let me help.

19:05.052 --> 19:08.503
But we just got through
some really heavy stuff.

19:08.505 --> 19:10.172
Exactly.

19:10.174 --> 19:12.674
And we're so much
stronger because of it.

19:12.676 --> 19:14.226
You're my best friend.

19:14.228 --> 19:16.428
We don't need these childish
necklaces to prove it.

19:16.430 --> 19:18.063
I don't think
they're childish.

19:18.065 --> 19:21.016
I lost mine when we were moving
everything into storage.

19:24.334 --> 19:26.104
Well...

19:26.106 --> 19:28.190
we can share mine.

19:28.192 --> 19:29.241
Really?

19:29.243 --> 19:31.610
Mm-hmm.

19:31.612 --> 19:35.113
Ooh, it'll be like
<i>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.</i>

19:35.115 --> 19:36.698
No, it's not.

19:38.142 --> 19:39.675
Hey, Karma?

19:41.205 --> 19:43.338
Hey, hey, I know it's late,

19:43.340 --> 19:46.374
but I just wanted
to tell you

19:46.376 --> 19:49.344
that I told a friend
our story today,

19:49.346 --> 19:53.932
and they called me naïve because
I still have hope for us.

19:53.934 --> 19:56.718
I love you,
and I'm not giving up.

19:56.720 --> 20:00.105
And if you can't find
your hope right now,

20:00.107 --> 20:01.723
then that's okay,

20:01.725 --> 20:05.393
because I have enough
for us both.

20:05.395 --> 20:09.147
Look, buddy, I don't know
what you heard,

20:09.149 --> 20:10.365
but I'm not gay.

20:10.367 --> 20:12.567
What are you doing
in Karma's room?

20:12.569 --> 20:14.569
You should talk to her
about that tomorrow.

20:18.075 --> 20:20.742
Felix.

20:20.744 --> 20:22.043
Who was that?

20:22.045 --> 20:23.712
Wrong number, Dad.

20:23.714 --> 20:26.248
Don't worry about it.
