OF BRINGING
THIS WORLD TO LIFE.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.867

ARE SO VISUAL.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.467
THE WRITING'S
VERY VISUAL,

03:55.500 --> 03:56.733
AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING,

03:56.767 --> 03:58.933
WOULD IT BE INTERESTING AT ALL
IF WE OPENED THE FILM

03:58.967 --> 04:01.067
WITH, UM...

04:01.067 --> 04:02.933
WITH CLOSE-UPS,

04:02.967 --> 04:04.233

WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
WE'RE SEEING AT FIRST,

04:08.967 --> 04:10.067
AND THEN WE REALIZE

04:10.067 --> 04:13.300
THAT IT'S...
IT'S, UM...

04:13.333 --> 04:14.800
IT'S JESSIE?
YEAH.

04:14.833 --> 04:16.067

04:16.100 --> 04:17.067
AND THEY'RE FUCKING, RIGHT,

04:17.067 --> 04:18.700
BUT WE'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

04:18.733 --> 04:20.200
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

04:20.233 --> 04:21.900
WHAT...

WE'RE FEELING IT.

04:25.733 --> 04:26.867
THAT'S SO VISUAL.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.400
AND THEN
WE WOULD FLASH BACK

04:29.433 --> 04:31.600
TO WHEN JESSIE
FIRST ARRIVES IN L.A.,

04:31.633 --> 04:32.733
SO WE WOULD BE NON-LINEAR.

04:32.767 --> 04:34.067

THE WHOLE PIECE SHOULD BE...

SUPPOSED TO KNOW

04:38.500 --> 04:40.467
THAT JESSIE AND KARINA
ARE TOGETHER,

IT'S GOING TO RUIN

OF THE FILM.

WOULD BE LINEAR.

THE STORYTELLING.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.667

RIGHT NOW,

04:48.367 --> 04:49.967

WHERE MY HEAD IS AT.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.667

04:51.700 --> 04:54.133

05:01.633 --> 05:03.267
TO REALLY...
TO REALLY GO FOR IT.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.367
YOU KNOW, TO NOT FAKE IT.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.933
TO JUST BE RAW
AND REAL, AND--

05:05.967 --> 05:07.200
ISN'T THAT PORNOGRAPHY?

05:07.233 --> 05:08.733
WHY?

05:08.767 --> 05:10.700

THERE'S NO STORY.

A GREAT STORY.

RIGHT, JENNY?

49:08.567 --> 49:09.767

ABOUT LESBIANS?

49:09.800 --> 49:10.800

49:10.833 --> 49:12.167
WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE
ABOUT LESBIANS?

49:12.200 --> 49:13.367
YOU KNOW,
I WAS INTO LESBIANS

49:13.400 --> 49:16.433
WAY BEFORE THIS NEW
CHIC LESBIAN FAD.

49:16.467 --> 49:17.467
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW,

49:17.500 --> 49:19.067
BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE
A 35-MILLIMETER PRINT

49:19.067 --> 49:20.433
OF THE KILLING
OF SISTER GEORGE.

49:20.467 --> 49:21.600

49:28.467 --> 49:29.867
WHEN I READ
YOUR STORY,

49:29.900 --> 49:32.167
I THOUGHT, "THIS COULD BE

49:32.200 --> 49:34.367
"JUST LIKE A REGULAR
LESBIAN MOVIE,

49:34.400 --> 49:35.867
BUT THAT'S BEEN DONE
A MILLION TIMES BEFORE."

49:35.900 --> 49:37.233

49:37.267 --> 49:38.533
I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN DONE
A MILLION TIMES.

YES, LESBIAN,

49:42.100 --> 49:43.567

49:43.600 --> 49:45.333
