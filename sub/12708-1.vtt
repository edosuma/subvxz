WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:02.235
GILES:
 Previously:

00:02.270 --> 00:04.304
I know you never loved me.
I know that I'm a monster.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.738
But you treat me
like a man.

00:05.772 --> 00:09.042
SPIKE:
 "So they sent the key to her
 in the form of a sister."

00:09.076 --> 00:12.846
You were created
to open the gates
that separate dimensions.

00:12.880 --> 00:18.919
The little girl, the key.
Destroy it, and the will
of the beast will be broken.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.653
I have to jump.
It'll kill you.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.356
Look at what's happening.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.695
No.
Dawnie, I have to.

00:38.939 --> 00:42.375
BUFFY:
 Be brave. Live.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.145
For me.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.969
SPIKE:
Come on!

01:10.003 --> 01:12.573
We're never gonna get
anything killed with
you lot holding me back.

01:12.605 --> 01:15.275
I thought the big ones
were supposed
to tire more easily.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.876
No, that's
over-the-hill shopkeepers.

01:16.909 --> 01:18.245
I'm fine.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.781
I just need
to die for a minute.

01:20.813 --> 01:24.551
WILLOW:
 Guys, heads up!

01:24.585 --> 01:28.256
The vampire's circling
 back towards you, 6:00.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.924
Try to drive him towards
 the Van Elton crypt.

01:30.957 --> 01:33.860
-Van Elton?
-Is that the one with
the cute little gargoyle?

01:35.996 --> 01:38.165
WILLOW:
 Left! Make him go left!

01:38.198 --> 01:39.667
Well, how?

01:57.518 --> 02:00.721
Big, fast and dumb.
Just the way I like 'em.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.000
Sounds like
the units are engaged.

02:13.032 --> 02:14.602
WILLOW:
 Xander, Anya, stop!

02:14.634 --> 02:17.271
Great googly moogly, Willow.
Would you quit doing that?

02:17.305 --> 02:21.008
-I told you I was gonna get
 a lay of the land.
-But not the lay of my brain.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.877
It's kind of intrusive.
You could knock first
or something.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.878
-Xander--
-I know, I know.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.014
I don't have to talk
when I answer you.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.318
But I saw The Fury,
and that way lies
spooky carnival death.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.552
WILLOW:
 Xander, vampire,
 other side of that tomb.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.954
You can get the jump on him
 if you go the other way.

02:34.987 --> 02:37.324
Why didn't you just say so?

02:45.865 --> 02:47.668
WILLOW:
 Tara, down!

02:52.673 --> 02:54.574
(grunting)

02:56.009 --> 02:58.512
Spike!
(gasping)

03:05.786 --> 03:07.820
Spike!

03:07.854 --> 03:09.990
What are you doing?
Help him.

03:10.022 --> 03:11.191
I did.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.937
(coughing)

03:32.479 --> 03:34.747
You might have let me in
on your plan
while he throttled me.

03:34.781 --> 03:38.786
Oh, poor Watcher.
Did your life
pass before your eyes?

03:38.819 --> 03:41.921
Cup of tea, cup of tea,
almost got shagged,
cup of tea?

03:41.954 --> 03:45.692
WILLOW:
 Guys, help Xander and Anya
 over by the Anderson tomb.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.895
ANYA:
Xander!

03:52.098 --> 03:54.234
BUFFY:
I got it!

04:20.661 --> 04:23.096
That'll put marzipan
in your pie plate, Bingo!

04:27.167 --> 04:30.170
What's with
the Dadaism, Red?

04:30.202 --> 04:33.072
Yeah, she says that pie thing
every time she stakes
a vamp now.

04:33.105 --> 04:35.675
I don't know.
I was trying to
program in some new puns,

04:35.709 --> 04:38.110
and I kind of ended up
with word salad.

04:38.144 --> 04:41.148
I think it's funny.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.182
It's a glitch.
I'll fix it.

04:43.216 --> 04:46.487
We just can't have her
messing up in front
of the wrong person...

04:46.519 --> 04:48.588
or the wrong thing.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.358
We need the world
and the underworld...

04:51.391 --> 04:52.992
to believe that
Buffy is alive and well.

04:53.026 --> 04:56.697
And I will, therefore, fix it.
I got her head back on,
didn't I?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.197
And I got her off
those knock-knock jokes.

04:58.230 --> 04:59.466
Oh, who's there?

04:59.500 --> 05:01.267
You know, if we
want her to be exactly--

05:01.300 --> 05:03.870
She'll never be exactly.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.038
I know.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.540
The only really real Buffy
is really Buffy.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.843
And she's gone.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.612
If we want her to be exactly--
She'll never be exactly.
I know.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.382
The only really real Buffy
is really Buffy,
and she's gone who?

05:16.884 --> 05:19.319
(theme music plays)

06:12.605 --> 06:14.942
WILLOW:
Where's my clog?

06:14.975 --> 06:18.411
I think there's
a clog-eating monster
under the bed.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.413
It's really those
lesser-known monsters...

06:20.447 --> 06:22.582
that make living
in Sunnydale so hard.

06:22.615 --> 06:24.884
I believe that
that is a Dawn monster.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.420
She borrowed them yesterday.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.288
Dawnie?

06:28.321 --> 06:31.559
Hey, you up?

06:31.591 --> 06:33.360
You doing okay?

06:33.393 --> 06:38.130
Besides terror about today
and a general feeling
of impending doom? Swell.

06:38.165 --> 06:41.268
Breakfast will make
all things better.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.937
Ooh. Pancakes
could go in bellies.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.276
Dawnie?
Hey, you.

06:49.308 --> 06:51.612
Today's the big day, huh?

06:51.644 --> 06:55.449
Kind of day that makes you wanna
return clogs, don't you think?

06:55.483 --> 06:57.817
(muffled)
I didn't take your clogs.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.399
-Morning.
-Morning.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.302
I was thinking we could go over
your programming again.

07:15.334 --> 07:16.970
Again? You've done
enough, sweetie.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.807
She's either ready to face
this thing or she's not.

07:23.442 --> 07:28.915
Oh. Um, here's some juice,
and pancakes are on the way.
Funny shapes or rounds?

07:28.949 --> 07:32.586
Rounds are fine.
Uh, what's up
with the mega-witches?

07:32.620 --> 07:34.987
I don't know if
you could call us "mega."
Willow, maybe--

07:35.021 --> 07:37.591
No, I mean,
who's gonna eat all that?

07:37.625 --> 07:40.827
Oh! Oops.
Um, she wanted to help.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.797
And I got her started,
but then I forgot to unstart.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.298
House of chicks, relax.
I'm a man, and I have a tool.

07:46.332 --> 07:48.134
(door closes)

07:48.168 --> 07:50.470
Tools.
Lots of plural tools...

07:50.504 --> 07:53.305
in my, uh, toolbox.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.509
Ah! Sandwiches.
Excellent.

07:55.543 --> 07:59.346
-Men like sandwiches.
-Help yourself, really.

07:59.379 --> 08:03.283
So what brings you
so early, Your Macho-ness?

08:03.315 --> 08:05.519
Brought that soldering wire
you wanted for
Buffybot's tune-up.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.687
You got funny shapes
anyway. Sorry.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.622
-(telephone ringing)
-I'll get it!

08:09.656 --> 08:10.490
ALL:
No!

08:10.524 --> 08:13.627
-Um, it could be my dad.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.795
He said he'd call today.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.028
BUFFYBOT:
I'll just say hello.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.999
He's my biological ancestor.

08:19.031 --> 08:22.134
Hello?
Hey, Anya.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.403
Really?
That's fantastic!

08:24.437 --> 08:27.206
Anya found that thing
for tonight.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.976
Oh, yeah? Great.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.312
And you're
her sweet cookie-face.

08:32.345 --> 08:36.216
I go by many names.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.285
-What's tonight?
-Oh, just a Scooby meeting.
Spike'll be here with you.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.255
WILLOW:
You know, Buffy... bot,

08:43.289 --> 08:45.325
maybe you should
let the machine--

08:45.357 --> 08:47.927
the other machine,
answer the phone
from now on. Okay?

08:47.961 --> 08:50.163
Is my phone manner
not correct?

08:50.197 --> 08:52.700
It-It's perfect.
It's just we can't
take the chance...

08:52.732 --> 08:55.936
that Mr. Summers
might talk to you
and know something's wrong.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.205
If he thought
the real Buffy was gone,

08:58.238 --> 09:00.340
he could take Dawn away.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.241
DAWN:
And I want to stay here...

09:02.274 --> 09:04.244
with you and Willow
and Tara.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.947
-Understand?
-I do.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.450
I want you
to stay here as well.
You're my sister.

09:19.292 --> 09:23.029
So, excellent.
We're agreed.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.532
Sit your robo-self down
so we can get to work.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.368
We need to fix up
those fighting skills pronto.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.303
Actually, we have bigger worries
than her fighting skills today.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.472
-Way bigger.
-I guess.

09:33.505 --> 09:35.307
Depends on how highly
you prize punning.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.277
WILLOW:
I'm serious, Xander.

09:37.309 --> 09:40.047
Buffybot is about to
face her most dangerous
challenge ever.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.115
(bell ringing)

09:42.149 --> 09:45.284
As you can see,
we provide the best
in progressive learning,

09:45.317 --> 09:47.988
but we can't
teach your children
unless you do.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.923
As parents, you have
a responsibility...

09:50.957 --> 09:52.826
to create
the right attitude...

09:52.860 --> 09:56.929
to teach your child
what school can mean.

09:56.963 --> 10:00.734
Ms. Summers?

10:00.768 --> 10:04.203
School is where you learn.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.909
Exactly.
Parents let kids focus
on school...

10:09.942 --> 10:13.413
as a social experience
rather than
a learning experience.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.649
We want you to get
your kids just as excited
about education...

10:16.683 --> 10:18.618
as they are
about the lunch hour.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.153
I helped make lunch today.

10:21.187 --> 10:24.490
-Oh.
-Yes, before school.

10:24.524 --> 10:27.827
Peanut butter and jelly.
I don't eat,
but Dawn takes one every day.

10:27.860 --> 10:30.998
Tell me about it.
My kid's been
brown-bagging it...

10:31.030 --> 10:33.365
even though I paid
for the lunch program.

10:33.399 --> 10:37.269
It's true.
Something has to be done
about the quality of the food.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.905
(voices overlapping)

10:50.649 --> 10:55.388
Anya, this register report
for January
looks a bit off.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.924
Pull the files again.

11:02.394 --> 11:05.732
Are you mad at me?

11:05.765 --> 11:08.500
-Mad? No, I'm-I'm--
-Well, then why
are you torturing me?

11:08.534 --> 11:11.538
You know,
I used to punish people
like this when I was a demon.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.539
I made them
double-check spreadsheets
for all eternity.

11:13.572 --> 11:15.542
I'm sorry if you resent
my thoroughness,

11:15.575 --> 11:18.644
but I won't be comfortable
leaving here until I know
that absolutely--

11:18.677 --> 11:20.847
You're taking
the Ramadan effigy?

11:22.414 --> 11:25.585
It's not inventory.
It's my personal
collection.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.554
Oh, huh.
Aren't you Mr. Dicey Semantics?

11:28.587 --> 11:30.758
So, what?
You think you can just
take anything you want?

11:32.292 --> 11:34.761
-Give it!
-No, you give it!

11:34.794 --> 11:37.063
Ow! Ow!

11:37.096 --> 11:40.600
Ow! Ow!

11:40.633 --> 11:44.772
Okay, when I'm marveling
at the immaturity,
be scared.

11:44.804 --> 11:48.575
Anya, Giles is gonna
leave the store to you
when he goes.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.677
What more do you want?

11:50.710 --> 11:53.013
I'm not leaving
the store to anyone.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.750
I'm going to England.
I'm not dead.
I'm still a partner.

11:56.783 --> 11:59.019
A silent overseas partner.

11:59.052 --> 12:03.255
Who you should be very nice to
unless you want to end up
working at Video Hut.

12:13.633 --> 12:16.403
What are you doing?
What kind of gratitude is that?

12:16.436 --> 12:18.138
I know.

12:18.171 --> 12:22.909
It's just...
he keeps saying he's going,
and then he doesn't.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.711
And I keep
almost being in charge,
but then I'm not.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.280
And maybe he shouldn't
even be going at all.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.750
But we can't talk about that,
and it all just leaves me...

12:30.783 --> 12:33.753
with this stress
and bossiness stored up,
and it just leaks out.

12:35.422 --> 12:38.826
Just give it time, An.
This is hard for all of us.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.161
Just be patient.

12:41.193 --> 12:43.495
I was being patient,
but it took too long.

12:43.529 --> 12:46.432
I mean, I--
I miss Buffy.

12:46.466 --> 12:51.171
I do, but life
shouldn't just stop
because she's gone.

12:51.203 --> 12:53.273
I'm sick of waiting
to take over here,

12:53.306 --> 12:54.942
and I'm sick of waiting
to tell everyone
about us.

12:56.643 --> 12:59.111
We've talked about this.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.648
We can't announce
our engagement while things
are so up in the air.

13:01.681 --> 13:05.118
Why not?
It's happy news.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.187
Happy news in hard times
is a good thing.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.956
It is.
But let's just hold on.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.491
We'll know more after
we talk to Willow
and Tara tonight.

13:12.524 --> 13:14.494
Fine. Whatever.
Just remember that...

13:14.527 --> 13:16.462
this whole marriage thing
was your stupid idea.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.398
I didn't ask
to be all crazy.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.475
So my homeroom teacher,
Ms. Lefcourt, was, like,

13:29.509 --> 13:31.677
"Your sister's
an example to us all."

13:31.711 --> 13:34.681
(chuckles)
She wanted to make it
National Buffy Day.

13:34.713 --> 13:37.549
-Makes sense.
-It does?

13:37.584 --> 13:40.452
Yeah, she responded to Buffybot
because a robot is predictable.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.056
It's boring.
A perfect teacher's pet.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.125
That's all schools are,
you know.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.427
Just factories spewing out
mindless little automatons...

13:50.263 --> 13:52.731
who go on to be
very valuable...

13:52.764 --> 13:57.370
and productive members
of society,
and you should go...

13:57.403 --> 14:00.106
because Buffy
would want you to.

14:05.211 --> 14:08.615
Check.
One mindless automaton
coming up.

14:10.783 --> 14:14.854
So, uh, what do you
fancy, bit?
A game of rummy?

14:14.888 --> 14:17.057
Well, um, Willow and Tara
said they'd be back early.

14:18.958 --> 14:22.062
You don't really have to hang.
I mean, if you're bored.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.599
I'm not,
and, yeah, I do.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.036
But I'm fine alone.
It's not like
anyone's coming after me.

14:29.068 --> 14:31.671
I'm not the key.

14:31.703 --> 14:35.542
Or if I am, I don't
open anything anymore.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.445
It's over. Remember?

14:40.246 --> 14:43.283
I'm not leaving you
here by yourself,
so forget it.

14:45.052 --> 14:48.087
-Well, I'm just saying--
-(slams table)

14:48.120 --> 14:51.191
No.

14:51.224 --> 14:55.095
I'm not leaving you
to get hurt.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.830
Not again.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.642
Aah!
(sobbing)

15:09.676 --> 15:12.544
BUFFYBOT:
Don't be scared.

15:12.578 --> 15:16.082
-I'm going to kill him.
-Slayer!

15:16.115 --> 15:18.317
You can run away now.

15:21.153 --> 15:23.355
Not you!

15:41.474 --> 15:43.643
(electrical crackling)

15:43.676 --> 15:47.514
You're-- You're--
You're a machine!

15:47.547 --> 15:51.618
Thank you!
Stop!

15:58.325 --> 16:01.494
Vampires, beware.
(electrical whirring)

16:16.375 --> 16:19.278
TARA:
The Urn of Osiris.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.647
You really found it.

16:20.679 --> 16:22.282
ANYA:
Yeah.

16:22.315 --> 16:25.018
It wasn't easy.
I went through every supplier
the Magic Box has.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.120
You used
a Magic Box supplier?

16:27.153 --> 16:29.355
What if Giles
finds out?

16:29.389 --> 16:31.390
He's too busy not leaving
to pay attention to me.

16:31.423 --> 16:34.293
Besides, I ended up
getting it on eBay.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.197
You found the last known
Urn of Osiris on eBay?

16:37.230 --> 16:39.499
Yeah, from this
desert gnome in Cairo.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.634
He drove a really hard bargain,
but I finally got him
to throw in

16:41.668 --> 16:43.735
a limited edition
Backstreet Boys lunch box for--

16:43.769 --> 16:46.706
(Xander coughs)

16:46.739 --> 16:48.975
A friend.

16:49.008 --> 16:53.346
See you got
your somber on, Wil.
Is the urn not up to spec?

16:55.414 --> 16:59.652
It's the one,
which means it's time.

16:59.686 --> 17:04.021
It's time?
Like, "time" time?

17:04.057 --> 17:06.159
With the... timeliness?

17:06.192 --> 17:08.060
Are you sure?

17:08.095 --> 17:09.261
I am.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.930
TARA:
Mercury's in retrograde,

17:10.962 --> 17:12.265
and we have--

17:12.298 --> 17:14.933
Do we have everything?

17:14.967 --> 17:16.769
Just about.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.239
But why the sudden rushy-rush?
I mean, did the bot
blow her cover at school?

17:19.271 --> 17:22.174
TARA: No, she did great.
She impressed
all the teachers.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.777
And they still thought
it was Buffy?

17:24.810 --> 17:28.748
-Tomorrow night,
we'll meet back here.
-Whoa!

17:28.780 --> 17:31.049
Let's apply the brakes
and check the rear
and side-view mirrors here.

17:34.052 --> 17:36.756
This is deep stuff, Willow.

17:36.788 --> 17:38.758
We're talking
about raising the dead.

17:38.790 --> 17:41.461
It's time
we stopped talking.

17:41.493 --> 17:45.432
Tomorrow night,
we're bringing Buffy back.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.840
Tomorrow?

17:55.741 --> 17:58.076
I don't know.

17:58.111 --> 18:01.780
Discovery Channel has monkeys,
and our tape machine's
all wonky.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.183
Guys, I need you
onboard here.

18:05.684 --> 18:10.222
It's just--
It feels wrong.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.159
TARA:
It is wrong.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.093
It's against all
the laws of nature...

18:14.126 --> 18:17.396
and practically
impossible to do, but
it's what we agreed to.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.832
If-If you guys are
changing your minds--

18:19.865 --> 18:22.402
Nobody's changing
their minds, period.

18:22.434 --> 18:25.805
Excuse me? Who made you
the boss of the group?

18:25.837 --> 18:28.641
-You did.
-You said Willow
should be boss.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.109
And then you said let's vote,
and it was unanimous.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.313
And you made her
this little plaque
that said "Boss of Us,"

18:33.346 --> 18:34.980
and you put little sparkles
on it and--

18:35.013 --> 18:36.449
Valid points all.

18:37.549 --> 18:41.988
But we--
I mean--

18:42.020 --> 18:43.756
We were just
talking then.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.259
Xander, I can do this.
I promise.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.694
But not without you.

18:48.728 --> 18:53.031
Should we maybe tell Giles?
You know, now that
we're really ready.

18:53.065 --> 18:55.468
It's not like
he's going anywhere...
ever.

18:55.501 --> 18:58.471
No. No one else
can know.

18:58.505 --> 19:02.674
Not Giles,
not Spike, not Dawn.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.711
They might not understand.

19:04.743 --> 19:07.046
What if something
does go wrong?

19:07.078 --> 19:09.316
I'm telling you--
it won't.

19:09.348 --> 19:11.683
XANDER:
Scenario--

19:11.718 --> 19:14.119
We raise Buffy
from the grave.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.688
She tries to eat our brains.

19:15.721 --> 19:19.125
Do we, "A,"
congratulate ourselves
on a job well-done--

19:19.157 --> 19:21.059
Xander,
this isn't zombies.

19:21.093 --> 19:25.531
And zombies don't eat brains
anyway, unless instructed to
by their zombie masters.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.999
A lot of people get that wrong.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.701
This isn't like Dawn trying
to bring Mrs. Summers back

19:29.736 --> 19:31.971
or anything
we've dealt with before.

19:32.003 --> 19:35.541
Buffy didn't die
a natural death.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.743
She was killed
by mystical energy.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.846
Which means
we do have a shot.

19:39.878 --> 19:42.815
It means more than that.

19:42.848 --> 19:46.919
It means we don't know
where she really is.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.590
We saw her body, Wil.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.593
We buried it.

19:53.625 --> 19:56.863
Her body, yeah.

19:56.895 --> 20:01.099
But her soul?
Her essence?

20:01.133 --> 20:03.935
I mean, that could be
somewhere else.
She could be trapped

20:03.970 --> 20:08.106
in some sort of hell dimension
like Angel was,

20:08.140 --> 20:11.210
suffering eternal torment
just because she saved us.

20:11.243 --> 20:14.079
And I'm not gonna let her--

20:14.113 --> 20:16.214
I'm not gonna
leave her there.

20:21.953 --> 20:24.324
It's Buffy.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.229
What time do we meet?

20:31.763 --> 20:36.536
-Willow!
-What happened?
Where's Dawn?

20:36.568 --> 20:39.271
Upstairs in bed.
But the bot here...

20:39.306 --> 20:42.240
seems to have got
into a scrape
while she was on patrol.

20:42.275 --> 20:44.109
I think my feet
are broken.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.913
Looks more like a short
in the navigational system.

20:46.945 --> 20:49.715
Can you get me a flashlight?
It's in the, uh, kitchen.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.718
She wanted to go out
and look for you again,

20:51.750 --> 20:54.653
but I figured there were
enough things in Sunnydale
that go bump in the night.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.623
Good thinking.

20:56.655 --> 21:00.492
But my homing device
locates you when I'm injured.
I am programmed to go to you.

21:00.527 --> 21:03.395
Right, I know.
Still, I think
just this once...

21:03.430 --> 21:06.231
it was a good idea
to stay put.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.800
Spike was right.

21:11.337 --> 21:13.405
BUFFYBOT:
Sorry I questioned you, Spike.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.344
You know I admire your brain
almost as much
as your washboard abs.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.816
-I told you to make her
stop doing that.
-I did.

21:23.849 --> 21:27.118
I mean, I thought
I got all that stuff
out of the program.

21:27.153 --> 21:31.590
Well, you've got her
opened up. Fix it.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.626
Sure. I mean, I have
a lot of work here,
but I'll see what I can do.

21:34.661 --> 21:38.330
Can you shine the flashlight
right here?

21:38.365 --> 21:40.700
Spike?

21:42.034 --> 21:44.036
Did I say something wrong?

21:44.069 --> 21:46.405
No.
It's not your fault.

21:48.074 --> 21:50.343
I think Spike
stopped liking me.

21:51.677 --> 21:55.548
That's not true.
He thinks you're swell.

21:55.582 --> 21:59.586
Then how come he never
looks at me anymore?
Even when he's talking to me.

22:01.319 --> 22:05.825
He just gets cranky,
the way vampires do.

22:05.857 --> 22:09.395
Now just relax.
I am gonna make you
good as new.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.566
I promise.

23:44.790 --> 23:49.161
That was splendid.
Now, try it again.
(panting)

23:49.194 --> 23:52.163
Only this time,
remember your breathing.

23:54.032 --> 23:56.836
(inhales, exhales deeply)

23:58.871 --> 24:01.406
No, that's good,
but, uh,

24:01.440 --> 24:05.778
think of the breath as chi,
air as a life source.

24:05.811 --> 24:08.279
I don't require
oxygen to live.

24:08.314 --> 24:11.083
Of course,
strictly speaking, but--

24:11.116 --> 24:13.619
Uh, Maybe you should stick
to the standard drill.

24:13.653 --> 24:16.756
You know, you don't want her
to blow another gasket.

24:16.788 --> 24:20.026
I'm testing her responses
after her injury.

24:20.058 --> 24:24.029
I see no harm in imparting
a little Eastern philosophy.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.999
Well, I just think
that the concept of chi...

24:27.032 --> 24:29.801
might be a little, you know,
hard for her to grasp.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.804
You know,
she's not the descendant...

24:31.837 --> 24:33.839
of a long line
of mystical warriors.

24:33.873 --> 24:36.174
She's the descendant
of a toaster oven.

24:36.208 --> 24:39.310
Yes, well, I appreciate
your input, Anya,

24:39.345 --> 24:43.082
but I think Buffybot
has responded nicely
to our sessions.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.786
Well, you're the boss.

24:46.818 --> 24:49.221
Still.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.189
(sighs)

24:50.221 --> 24:51.723
Would you like
to test me again?

24:51.758 --> 24:53.058
(door closes)

24:53.092 --> 24:54.693
No. Perhaps
we should call it a day.

24:54.727 --> 24:57.896
Your-- Your responses
are fine.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.973
Well, perhaps Anya's right.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.009
Perhaps I am trying to
teach you as if you were a--

25:10.041 --> 25:12.010
Human?

25:14.012 --> 25:16.583
-Yes.
-I like your teachings.

25:16.615 --> 25:19.719
Every Slayer
needs her Watcher.

25:19.751 --> 25:21.587
I'm not so sure about that.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.758
-What do you mean?
-Nothing.

25:28.394 --> 25:31.163
I just can't help
but wonder if...

25:31.196 --> 25:34.266
she would have been
better off without me--
Buffy.

25:35.968 --> 25:39.371
I don't think that's true.
You were very helpful to her.

25:39.404 --> 25:43.509
Right. Yes,
I was a perfect Watcher.

25:43.541 --> 25:47.278
I did what any
good Watcher would do--

25:47.378 --> 25:49.414
got my Slayer killed
in the line of duty.

25:49.448 --> 25:52.719
-Oh, that wasn't your fault.
-Of course not.

25:52.751 --> 25:56.288
That's how all
Slayer/Watcher relationships
end, isn't it?

25:58.124 --> 26:01.794
She's gone.
I did my job.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.932
Then why are you
still here?

26:11.502 --> 26:13.673
(rock music plays)

26:18.243 --> 26:20.578
So I got her cornered
in this alley, see?

26:20.613 --> 26:22.781
You got
the Slayer cornered?

26:22.815 --> 26:25.050
Yeah. I figured
it's my duty.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.819
She's a menace
to our society.

26:27.854 --> 26:31.390
So we fight,
and I'm, like,
boom, boom, boom!

26:31.423 --> 26:33.925
And I got her
on the ropes--
(gasping)

26:35.426 --> 26:37.997
You're lying to me.

26:38.029 --> 26:42.268
I swear on all that's unholy.
You haven't even heard
the best part.

26:42.300 --> 26:45.070
I cut her, right?
And she's--

26:45.104 --> 26:48.406
I don't know,
some kind of machine.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.808
She's not human.

26:53.311 --> 26:55.114
Hey, hey, hey!

27:00.886 --> 27:03.855
What's with
the blood rat?

27:03.890 --> 27:04.824
Talk!

27:04.856 --> 27:05.692
Okay.

27:05.724 --> 27:07.960
Uh, so,
I was over in Sunnydale,

27:07.993 --> 27:10.696
minding my own beeswax,
when I see the Slayer--

27:10.730 --> 27:12.163
The part about the robot.

27:12.198 --> 27:14.133
We fought, right?

27:14.165 --> 27:16.803
And I was, like,
all over her.
Boom! Boom!

27:16.836 --> 27:18.604
He says the Slayer's
been replaced...

27:18.636 --> 27:21.307
by some kind
of machine.

27:22.808 --> 27:26.178
A robot, yeah.
And I kicked
her synthetic ass.

27:26.211 --> 27:28.279
You should have seen
the sparks.

27:28.314 --> 27:31.182
You telling me
there's no Slayer
in Sunnydale?

27:34.519 --> 27:39.057
That's what I'm saying.
They got some kind of decoy
standing in for her.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.993
Town is wide open.

27:42.028 --> 27:44.195
Nowhere like the Hellmouth
for a party.

27:44.230 --> 27:47.566
There's all kinds
of bad in that place.

27:47.598 --> 27:50.903
(all chuckling)

27:50.936 --> 27:55.406
I guess with your muscle,
you could own it in no time.

27:55.441 --> 27:56.875
Hey, look...

27:56.909 --> 28:00.211
I know you guys don't usually
let vampires join the gang,

28:00.246 --> 28:02.513
and I got the whole
sunlight issue.

28:02.548 --> 28:05.651
But I was thinking, you know.
As thanks for the 4-1-1,

28:05.683 --> 28:08.554
you could let me
throw in with you--
(groans)

28:10.923 --> 28:13.392
I'll think it over.

28:13.424 --> 28:16.561
Let's ride!
(all shout in agreement)

28:16.595 --> 28:19.464
(indistinct metal music)

28:40.752 --> 28:45.057
(Willow chanting
in foreign language)

28:45.090 --> 28:49.761
(chanting continues)

28:49.796 --> 28:53.265
The gods do command thee
from thy majesty.

28:53.298 --> 28:59.771
(chanting continues)

28:59.806 --> 29:04.977
Come forward, blessed one.
Know your calling.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.982
Come forward, blessed one.

29:30.635 --> 29:36.008
Accept our humble gratitude
for your offering.

29:36.041 --> 29:38.443
In death,

29:38.477 --> 29:40.346
you give life.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.952
May you find wings
to the kingdom.

29:54.326 --> 29:58.197
TARA:
Hey. You're late.

29:58.230 --> 30:02.034
Oh. I, uh,
had to get that thing.

30:02.067 --> 30:05.270
Giles isn't around.
You can dump the cryptic.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.874
The last spell
ingredient.

30:07.906 --> 30:12.478
Okay, right. What is
 vino de madre anyway?

30:13.880 --> 30:17.516
Wine of the mother.
Kind of black market stuff.

30:17.548 --> 30:19.550
Black market?
You didn't tell me that.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.953
You shouldn't have gone alone.
It could have been dangerous.

30:21.988 --> 30:27.159
Sorry. I didn't--
I was careful.

30:27.192 --> 30:29.560
Well, it must be
something pretty intense.

30:29.595 --> 30:32.463
The black market's
all baby teeth
and spooky fluids.

30:32.498 --> 30:36.868
All I know is
we have to have it to
finish the spell, so...

30:36.903 --> 30:39.872
it's good stuff
in my book.

30:39.905 --> 30:41.673
How come you guys
are here, anyway?

30:41.707 --> 30:43.976
I thought we weren't
gonna meet till later.

30:44.009 --> 30:45.711
Uh, well, we weren't.

30:45.743 --> 30:48.346
It just felt weird
hanging out on our own.

30:48.380 --> 30:51.849
It's better
if we stay together.

30:51.884 --> 30:54.153
Ah, you got
butterflies, baby?

30:54.185 --> 30:55.586
More like bats.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.855
Y-You wanna look
at the money?

30:57.890 --> 30:59.758
I find
it always calms me.

30:59.790 --> 31:03.028
That's okay. Thanks.

31:03.061 --> 31:06.597
Baby, tell those bats
that everything is gonna
be all right.

31:06.632 --> 31:09.434
I promise.
We couldn't be
more prepared.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.502
I know. I just wish
it was time.

31:11.537 --> 31:16.375
I can't stand worrying
about it anymore.

31:16.407 --> 31:21.547
Well, it's your lucky day then.
I have something
that will distract you.

31:21.579 --> 31:24.549
WILLOW:
What?

31:24.583 --> 31:26.085
"I've gone.

31:26.117 --> 31:29.288
"Not one for good-byes,
 I thought it best
 to slip out quietly.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.990
"Love to you all, Giles."

31:35.094 --> 31:38.630
WILLOW:
You really think we'd
let you get away with that?

31:41.267 --> 31:43.868
I was trying to avoid
a scene, really.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.704
Like we'd make a scene.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.840
Not you. Me.

31:54.445 --> 31:58.450
Um--
We, uh, brought you
some lovely parting gifts.

31:58.483 --> 32:00.086
Get it? Apple pie?

32:02.288 --> 32:05.723
A-And a monster, sort of
a Sunnydale souvenir,
we thought.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.593
Grr! Arrgh!

32:08.961 --> 32:11.297
We got your presents
at the gas station.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.035
We were kind of
in a hurry.

32:17.435 --> 32:20.605
Um, we made this
in the car.

32:20.638 --> 32:23.275
It's why the letters
are all shaky.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.645
GILES:
This is, uh,

32:29.515 --> 32:31.916
impossible, really.

32:31.950 --> 32:36.454
We just wanted you to know
that we'll miss you.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.457
We'll be okay.

32:38.490 --> 32:42.794
We'll miss you,
but we'll be okay.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.132
I'll take really good care
of your money.

32:48.233 --> 32:49.701
(clears throat)
Yes, I have no doubt.

32:49.734 --> 32:53.638
WOMAN OVER P.A.:
Attention passengers,
Flight 3982,

32:53.672 --> 32:58.676
leaving for Los Angeles
and continuing to London,
rows 20 through 30--

32:58.710 --> 32:59.877
That's me.

32:59.911 --> 33:00.811
WILLOW:
Now?

33:00.846 --> 33:04.750
-We just made it.
-Just, yes.

33:08.220 --> 33:13.025
Well, look, if we're
gonna do this,
let's do it properly.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.824
I'm just
a phone call away...

33:45.856 --> 33:47.759
if you need anything.

33:49.627 --> 33:51.797
You must promise me.

33:53.199 --> 33:56.301
I do. I promise.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.809
Willow, I don't know
where to start.

34:05.943 --> 34:09.081
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

34:11.217 --> 34:14.885
I'm trying to be
stiff-upper-lippy.

34:14.920 --> 34:16.788
Right, right.

34:19.625 --> 34:24.096
Well, you should get going.
Don't you have
a life or something?

34:24.130 --> 34:27.766
Um, I suppose
that's the question, really.

34:30.436 --> 34:33.804
Just, uh,

34:33.838 --> 34:36.641
be careful, please.

34:53.125 --> 34:56.161
WILLOW:
What's he gonna do
over there by himself?

34:56.195 --> 34:59.597
I mean, he never talks
about people from England.

34:59.630 --> 35:00.766
What if he's lonely?

35:00.798 --> 35:02.000
TARA:
He won't be lonely.

35:02.032 --> 35:06.070
He used to live there
before, remember?

35:06.103 --> 35:08.106
And I'm sure we'll talk to him
all the time, right?

35:08.139 --> 35:10.509
It's not like he's--

35:10.541 --> 35:13.811
We'll call him tomorrow,
how about that?
See how his flight was. Yeah?

35:15.880 --> 35:18.516
Can you believe the timing?
I mean, he's leaving...

35:18.550 --> 35:21.586
right when we're ready to...
do the thing tonight.

35:21.619 --> 35:26.023
I know. I had hoped
we'd figure it out
before he, uh, he left.

35:26.056 --> 35:28.527
Maybe we should have told him.
I mean, what if it works?

35:29.394 --> 35:32.297
He'll come back.

35:32.331 --> 35:36.001
We should get Dawn home.
I want to go over
everything one more time.

35:36.034 --> 35:38.403
Nothing can
go wrong tonight.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.634
(lighter clicking)

36:08.666 --> 36:10.835
WILLOW:
Does everybody have
their candles?

36:10.869 --> 36:14.039
ANYA:
I'm trying.
My lighter won't stay lit.

36:14.072 --> 36:15.240
TARA:
Well, hurry. It has to--

36:15.273 --> 36:17.041
WILLOW:
What time is it?

36:17.074 --> 36:19.378
A minute till midnight.

36:19.411 --> 36:22.213
Come on, Anya.
Do you have it?

36:22.248 --> 36:24.550
I got it.
I got it. I got it.

36:25.416 --> 36:29.086
Okay, start the circle now.

36:37.563 --> 36:41.233
Osiris,
keeper of the gate,

36:41.266 --> 36:44.536
master of all fate,
hear us.

36:52.577 --> 36:55.280
Before time and after,

36:55.313 --> 36:57.782
before knowing and nothing.

37:01.652 --> 37:04.422
Accept our offering.

37:05.623 --> 37:07.659
Know our prayer.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.565
-Willow!
-No!

37:14.599 --> 37:17.969
She told me she'd be tested.
This-- This is what's
supposed to happen.

37:18.003 --> 37:20.204
Osiris,

37:20.237 --> 37:22.440
here lies the warrior
of the people.

37:22.474 --> 37:25.076
Let her cross over.

37:26.777 --> 37:28.045
(gasping)

37:28.079 --> 37:29.414
TARA:
Willow?

37:34.286 --> 37:36.887
-She needs help.
-Xander, she's strong.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.291
She said not to stop,
no matter what.

37:39.324 --> 37:42.393
If we break the cycle now,
it's over.

37:42.427 --> 37:45.463
(motorcycle engines revving)

37:45.496 --> 37:48.099
Oh, God.
What is that noise?

37:48.132 --> 37:50.869
(screaming, shouting)

38:28.206 --> 38:30.307
(panting)

38:31.976 --> 38:35.614
Osiris, let her cross over.
(groaning)

38:35.646 --> 38:37.715
XANDER:
Willow!

38:37.748 --> 38:41.219
TARA:
Willow? Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

38:51.362 --> 38:53.699
It's a test.
It's a test.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.503
Willow.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.911
That doesn't
belong to you.

39:05.943 --> 39:08.547
-Put it back.
-(screeching)

39:23.894 --> 39:28.400
Slayer. I've been hearing
interesting things about you.

39:28.434 --> 39:30.635
Yes. I am interesting.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.838
These your friends?

39:33.871 --> 39:36.442
They're my boys,
yeah.

39:36.474 --> 39:39.210
Good.
Now tell them to get back
on their loud bicycles...

39:39.244 --> 39:40.545
and go back wherever
they came from.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.748
Or what,
you'll electrocute us?

39:45.650 --> 39:47.818
Hold her!

39:51.255 --> 39:53.391
(groans)

39:54.960 --> 39:56.628
You're nothing
but a toy,

39:56.661 --> 39:58.730
a pretty toy.

39:59.931 --> 40:02.166
Wanna play?
(groans)

40:05.570 --> 40:08.306
I would,
but you've injured me.
I have to return to Willow.

40:28.358 --> 40:30.427
Get her!

40:31.663 --> 40:34.099
Stop her!

40:35.501 --> 40:37.603
Ride!

40:50.481 --> 40:52.550
(panting)

40:55.786 --> 40:58.789
Osiris, release her.

40:58.824 --> 41:01.527
Willow, I need service.

41:01.559 --> 41:03.961
(motorcycles revving)
-Oh!

41:10.201 --> 41:12.036
(gasps)

41:16.474 --> 41:17.976
TARA:
Willow!

41:21.713 --> 41:23.914
(screaming)
No!

41:25.182 --> 41:27.385
Willow!
(gasps)

41:27.418 --> 41:29.721
Look what I found!

41:33.257 --> 41:35.226
(gasping)

41:40.931 --> 41:43.034
XANDER:
Take off!
Go! Go!

41:51.242 --> 41:53.878
TARA:
Anya!

41:53.911 --> 41:55.681
(incants spell)

42:07.057 --> 42:09.427
Willow.

42:09.460 --> 42:12.664
Willow.
Are you okay?

42:12.697 --> 42:14.733
Did it work?

42:16.367 --> 42:18.235
I'm sorry.

42:39.925 --> 42:43.161
(gasping)

43:17.996 --> 43:19.831
Grr! Arrgh!
