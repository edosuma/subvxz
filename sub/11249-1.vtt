slow in coming .

29:39.194 --> 29:42.447
There. $200.

29:42.531 --> 29:46.075
Plus 50 President Harrison
owes you . You'll
get it when l get it.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.495
Seems like you're a man
trying to give away money

29:49.580 --> 29:51.122
and don't have
too many takers.

29:51.206 --> 29:54.292
You sound like a man
who is protesting the
pay is too high . Don't.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.878
You sign on , you'll earn
every cent of it.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.088
There you are.

29:59.173 --> 30:03.134

and lndian Territory,
year of our Lord , 1 889.

30:03.260 --> 30:07.180
N ineteen marshals.
l was authorized 60
when l came here.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.474
Told the president
even that was
not half enough .

30:09.558 --> 30:15.980
N ineteen marshals
and one court to cover
near 70, 000 square miles.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.816
A happy hunting ground
filled with bushwhackers,

30:18.901 --> 30:22.361
horse thieves, whiskey
peddlers, counterfeiters,
hide peelers,

30:22.446 --> 30:25.072
marauders that'll
kill you for a hatband !

30:25.157 --> 30:28.159
Now that's why
there's a badge
in my desk, Cooper,

30:28.243 --> 30:31.662
itching to sit on
somebody's chest
and no takers.

30:34.541 --> 30:37.585
Your marshals do cover
a lot of territory.

30:37.669 --> 30:41.380
You'll ride circuit
over an area half again
the size of Rhode lsland ,

30:41.465 --> 30:43.591
if and when
it's Marshal Cooper.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.762
Pick up the badge,
Mr. Cooper.

30:52.518 --> 30:56.145
Pick up the badge,
or leave justice to me
and my men .

31:06.949 --> 31:09.158
Those nine men ,

31:09.243 --> 31:13.079
if you find them ,
they're to be brought
before me alive.

31:19.294 --> 31:22.004
That old horse should
hold you for a spell .

31:22.089 --> 31:24.215
All right.

31:24.299 --> 31:25.800
Good luck, Marshal .

31:25.884 --> 31:27.134
Thank you .

32:12.472 --> 32:14.473
You're Cooper?

32:15.434 --> 32:17.852
J udge sent a wire

32:18.979 --> 32:21.397
Wasn't there
nobody outside?

32:21.481 --> 32:23.482
There's two men
with shotguns.

32:24.359 --> 32:27.778
l haven't had me
a night's sleep since
we picked up the Swede.

32:27.863 --> 32:29.947
How many men
did you bring with you?

32:30.532 --> 32:32.700
Can you have him ready

32:34.202 --> 32:36.078
J ust the two of you?

32:37.164 --> 32:38.414
Yeah .

32:39.124 --> 32:41.542
The hotel here in town ,
does it serve a good steak?

32:41.627 --> 32:43.794
l better have something
to eat before we leave.

32:43.879 --> 32:47.673
lf you're crazy enough
to try to take the
Swede in alone,

32:47.758 --> 32:50.051
you got a right to
try it on a full stomach !

34:02.791 --> 34:04.792
You're under arrest, Reno.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.172
You talking to me,
Marshal?

34:10.257 --> 34:12.091
Your name's Reno,
isn't it?

34:15.011 --> 34:16.469
Look, Marshal ,

what kind of town

34:16.554 --> 34:17.972

You don't remember me, do ya?

34:42.038 --> 34:43.121
No.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.835
When you hang a man ,
you better look at him .

34:58.138 --> 35:01.432
Don't go for that gun , Reno.

35:43.934 --> 35:46.018
Come up here
and take a look at him .

35:46.102 --> 35:47.895
He must've just rode in .

How much to bury him?

35:49.773 --> 35:52.066

Well , l . . .

35:52.484 --> 35:54.944

35:55.695 --> 35:58.823
All right.
There's $7 there,
and l'll give you $8 more.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.367
And mark it down there.

36:05.622 --> 36:08.499
l want everybody to
write down in this book
exactly what they saw.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.209

36:10.293 --> 36:12.127
Fine, then you say
that in writing .

36:12.212 --> 36:15.214

You gave him every chance.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.973
Well , the sheriff here will
write it down , then you
can put your mark on it.

That's the one the
Marshal just brought in .

37:07.434 --> 37:08.976

FENTON : The good Lord
takes care of those
that do his work.

38:16.044 --> 38:19.088
He just waltzed in here
and gave himself up.

38:22.175 --> 38:24.426
l never wanted
to hang you , mister.

38:24.511 --> 38:26.595
l asked them to
give you a chance.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.306
Maybe you remember that.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.642
l remember that.

38:32.602 --> 38:35.479
l was here in Fort Grant
looking to pick up a grubstake

38:35.563 --> 38:38.732
when l heard a marshal
with a hanging scar
had killed Reno.

38:39.943 --> 38:43.737
l knew then we. . .
We'd hung an innocent man .

38:44.531 --> 38:46.573
So l turned myself in .

38:46.825 --> 38:48.617
The others?
He gave me their names.

All right, Cooper, you do it
your way. You round them up
and bring them back.

39:01.423 --> 39:04.216
l don't know why
you had to kill Reno.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.468
lt's in my report.
l wanted him alive.

39:06.553 --> 39:07.678
l needed these names.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.471
You got your names.

39:09.597 --> 39:13.475

So,

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:19.756
it's no deal .

you never should've
offered him the money.

01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.224

mistakes we made:

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:33.896
the money,

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.523
we hung an innocent man ,

01:10:36.608 --> 01:10:38.609

finish the job.

the first two,

he's gonna have to find him .

"Hang them , and hang
them high ! There's no
