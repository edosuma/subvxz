02:09.463 --> 02:12.174
Stop being a baby.
It wasn't that heavy.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.510
You're breathing harder than I am.

02:14.593 --> 02:18.055
I'm just faking it.
To make you feel better.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.393
I'm just dropping it.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.817
- I forgot something.
- What?

02:33.403 --> 02:35.697
It's for my hypertension.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.909
Whoa. What's that?

02:39.451 --> 02:40.953
Amlodipine.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.121
What do you take for your arthritis?

02:43.205 --> 02:46.124
- Ibuprofen.
- I'm taking Fosamax.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.253
And I haven't noticed
any real improvement.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.712
I'll tell you something.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.549
I'll tell you
what's a real revelation. Diclofenac.

02:53.674 --> 02:57.636
- For your sciatica.
- My sciatica. I highly recommend it.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.847
Now, tell me.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.808
What do you take for your cholesterol?

03:03.183 --> 03:06.103
- Crestor.
- I told you! Take Lipitor!

03:06.687 --> 03:08.981
Mine was sky-rocketing
and it came right down.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.816
You don't remember me telling you?

03:12.276 --> 03:14.736
- No.
- I'm telling you again. Try Lipitor.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.530
Or get a new doctor.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.783
And while you're at it,
get yourself some Exelon.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.869
Now, what the hell is that for?

03:22.119 --> 03:23.287
Your memory.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.541
You're questioning my memory?

03:29.418 --> 03:31.712
Don't ever question my memory.

03:34.548 --> 03:39.344
So, your daughter and your granddaughter
are gonna sleep here?

03:40.095 --> 03:41.722
In theory, yeah.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.140
The two of them together?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.603
It's not the Ritz,
but it is a spare bedroom

03:47.686 --> 03:48.770
and the only one I got.

03:49.229 --> 03:53.066
Well, wouldn't it be more appropriate
if your son-in-law were to leave?

03:53.150 --> 03:57.529
- I mean, after all...
- After all, he behaved very poorly.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.741
And they have newspaper people
all over his house,

04:00.824 --> 04:03.827
which they should have,
to find out what he really did.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.247
So I thought the girls would
have a little more privacy here.

04:07.456 --> 04:08.749
And what about you?

04:09.333 --> 04:10.792
What about your peace?

04:12.878 --> 04:18.216
True. However, it gives me
a chance to be with my girls.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.344
Hmm.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.013
And what about these girls, hm?

04:24.389 --> 04:27.392
I mean, you know,
it's kind of sad to chuck 'em.

04:27.476 --> 04:28.602
I mean, they're such classics.

04:28.685 --> 04:32.356
Oh, I can never let
my girls know about my girls.

04:33.232 --> 04:36.235
No. What are you doing?
Take one, for Christ's sake.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.694
Be a man. Grow up.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.698
You mean you haven't dicked around
since you've been divorced?

04:41.990 --> 04:44.368
I'm afraid those days are over for me.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.372
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.208
Nexium.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.544
It's good for my stomach.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.756
All right, buddy. I got a family
waiting for a portrait.

04:58.966 --> 05:02.094
The old "in the cellar" extra buck.
Love it.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.220
You bet.

05:06.849 --> 05:09.685
Tell me when the girls arrive.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.771
- I'll stop by for a visit.
- You got it.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.190
Later.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.783
<i>Prostitutes paid
with taxpayers' money?</i>

05:24.867 --> 05:26.493
<i>Let's go live to the press conference</i>

05:26.577 --> 05:29.246
<i>with California's
Lieutenant Governor, David Addison.</i>

05:29.329 --> 05:30.664
<i>I am deeply sorry</i>

05:30.747 --> 05:33.500
<i>that I did not live up
to what was expected of me,</i>

05:33.584 --> 05:37.462
<i>and I must take full responsibility
for my misconduct.</i>

05:37.546 --> 05:40.757
<i>I am therefore resigning
as Lieutenant Governor.</i>

05:41.466 --> 05:44.469
<i>I now want to devote all my time</i>

05:44.553 --> 05:47.181
<i>toward earning back
the trust of my family.</i>

05:48.932 --> 05:51.018
<i>Words cannot express</i>

05:51.101 --> 05:55.355
<i>how sorry I feel for the terrible hurt
that I have caused them</i>

05:55.939 --> 05:57.191
<i>and how blessed I am</i>

05:57.274 --> 05:59.568
<i>that they have found it
in their hearts to forgive me.</i>

05:59.651 --> 06:00.652
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

06:00.736 --> 06:02.154
<i>How many prostitutes
have you slept with?</i>

06:02.738 --> 06:04.907
<i>Did your wife
find naked pics in your phone?</i>

06:04.990 --> 06:07.117
<i>What message
are you sending young women?</i>

06:12.372 --> 06:15.876
How long have we worked together?
Eight, ten years?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.086
Twelve.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.507
This man taught me everything I know.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.883
Come over here.

06:23.509 --> 06:26.303
His reviews were
a major cultural reference.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.555
It's a pleasure.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.976
But the industry's changing, Claude.

06:33.685 --> 06:37.231
I mean, with a constant stream
of multi-platform readership,

06:37.314 --> 06:40.859
our consumers are now more interested
than ever in what's happening.

06:40.943 --> 06:43.487
They're "woke," as they say.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.907
I really don't want to take advantage
of the special relationship

06:46.990 --> 06:48.367
that you have with this newspaper,

06:49.034 --> 06:52.079
but I really can't look the other way
as far as your family is...

06:52.162 --> 06:53.163
Stop.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.334
Don't go there.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.420
Okay. I'll tell you what.

07:00.629 --> 07:03.882
Why don't we turn this around
in your favor, huh?

07:04.132 --> 07:08.679
You enlighten us on the situation
of your son-in-law, more or less,

07:08.762 --> 07:12.808
so then you can call the shots before
any of those sleazy gossipmongers.

07:13.475 --> 07:15.394
So we keep the focus on him,

07:15.602 --> 07:17.563
instead of on your daughter and family,

07:17.646 --> 07:20.899
who are already weathering
a pretty nasty storm.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.777
I can guarantee fair treatment

07:23.861 --> 07:26.530
and no mention whatsoever
of intimate family issues.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.240
You can trust me on that, really.

07:28.866 --> 07:31.118
What about the article I sent you?

07:31.368 --> 07:33.203
Oh, the one on Pina Bausch?

07:33.328 --> 07:34.955
Heiner Muller.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.165
Oh, Heiner Mueller.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.209
- Muller. East German.
- Yes.

07:39.293 --> 07:43.005
Modernist playwright.
Known all over the world.

07:43.088 --> 07:46.383
Oh, right. Mark?

07:46.466 --> 07:49.970
Uh, we found it super interesting,
like everything you send us.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.347
A little bit difficult
to put into the print edition,

07:52.431 --> 07:55.893
but it might be perfect for our brand-new
cultural digital supplement.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.061
What the hell is he talking about?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.438
It's our online edition.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.316
It allows us to print
ancillary cultural news.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.318
- We even have an app.
- Take a look.

08:07.738 --> 08:08.989
Yeah.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.784
Wait a sec.

08:12.910 --> 08:15.454
- Can you bring that one back down?
- Yeah, sure.

08:16.038 --> 08:19.041
It sounds like this is something
you're interested in?

08:23.587 --> 08:28.634
Well, Henry Muller was
an important figure in European culture.

08:29.384 --> 08:33.429
I'm sure we can find a way
to fit him into the front page

08:33.514 --> 08:35.182
of the digital edition.

08:37.142 --> 08:40.520
That is, of course,
if we all do our part, huh?

08:43.398 --> 08:44.983
- Of course.
- Of course.

08:45.651 --> 08:48.445
- Send me the article, please.
- Sure.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.480
Jesus Christ!

10:19.828 --> 10:21.622
I really loved you.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.585
Still do.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.907
We also have
an impressive recreational room

10:56.990 --> 11:00.494
with light exercise equipment.
We also have activities...

11:04.498 --> 11:09.086
Now, our dining room serves
three well-balanced delicious meals.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.046
Everything is freshly made here.

11:11.129 --> 11:16.093
And right this way,
I'll take you out to our gardens.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.722
Now, of course,
this is our outpatient facility,

11:20.806 --> 11:24.309
which is separate
from the rest of the facilities.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.228
It's so beautiful.

11:26.311 --> 11:30.482
And you'll notice
that is very intimate, very secure.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.401
I love this garden.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.761
Mrs. Blanche, it's this way.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.527
Sir? You all right?

12:17.154 --> 12:19.781
- Huh?
- Are you all right? Are you lost?

12:19.865 --> 12:21.200
No.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.160
Would you like me
to take you back to your room?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.370
No. I can find my room.

12:26.371 --> 12:30.876
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm new here,
so I still don't know everybody yet.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.044
I'm working on it.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.838
I am new here.

12:37.299 --> 12:38.717
I'm Zephyr.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.595
So I'll be here. Just let me know
if you need anything, okay?

12:42.304 --> 12:43.555
All right. I'll see you around.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.853
Are you out of your mind?

12:49.937 --> 12:53.815
You'll get caught!
If you don't kill yourself first.

12:54.650 --> 12:58.028
These places can be very depressing.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.280
It's a very nice place.

13:00.364 --> 13:02.950
And I can think of absolutely nothing

13:03.033 --> 13:07.621
that I want to do more
than be next to her.

13:07.704 --> 13:08.914
She needs me.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.458
She may not even remember you,
for Christ's sake.

13:12.543 --> 13:15.337
Alzheimer's? No memory.

13:16.213 --> 13:17.548
- Really?
- Hmm.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.216
She'll remember me. Trust me.

13:19.341 --> 13:20.759
What makes you so sure?

13:21.260 --> 13:25.556
Because what she and I
shared together and lived together

13:26.348 --> 13:28.809
can never be forgotten.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.145
Oh.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.065
Yeah. Yeah.

13:36.650 --> 13:40.279
There was this girl in Ronda.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.531
That's a little place in southern Spain

13:42.614 --> 13:45.284
where the family used
to go for a summer vacation.

13:45.367 --> 13:48.787
She was petite. A little cross-eyed.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.039
- Hmm.
- But she had a gorgeous smile.

13:51.123 --> 13:55.252
And, oh, the most contagious laugh.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.754
Incredible.

13:58.589 --> 14:02.509
But, of course, you know,
I had to go back to the States.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.429
But we promised we'd write to one another

14:05.512 --> 14:07.806
and we did, we did for a time, but...

14:08.891 --> 14:10.267
I lost contact.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.395
Never even kissed her.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.273
So you do understand me?

14:17.608 --> 14:19.151
A little. Hmm.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.363
Is she now...

14:24.823 --> 14:25.824
available?

14:26.325 --> 14:27.868
What about her husband?

14:27.951 --> 14:29.369
Dead.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.832
You're the only person on this planet

14:33.916 --> 14:37.753
who would willingly
check himself in to an old folks' home.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.550
- Yeah?
- <i>Hey, Dad.</i>

14:43.634 --> 14:47.721
Sorry I didn't call sooner
but, with all the new allegations

14:47.804 --> 14:51.266
and talking to Tania
about everything, it's been a lot.

14:51.642 --> 14:54.228
- Well, how is she doing?
- <i>She's pretty upset.</i>

14:55.312 --> 14:57.773
And you? I know you're mad at me.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.442
I don't know how many times
I have to say this.

15:00.943 --> 15:04.071
You're making a colossal mistake.

15:04.238 --> 15:07.699
<i>I don't know what promises
this asshole has given you</i>

15:07.783 --> 15:10.035
<i>or how he did it,</i>

15:10.118 --> 15:12.829
<i>but he's a son of a bitch, he's ignorant,</i>

15:12.913 --> 15:15.332
and whatever he's up to doesn't hold water

15:15.415 --> 15:18.502
and in the future, you're gonna
find out very quickly, madam.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.797
Yeah, well, you always told me

15:21.880 --> 15:24.800
that I should take my chances,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.261
Any time you and Tania get bored

15:27.344 --> 15:29.930
with all the crap
that's going on at your house,

15:30.013 --> 15:33.475
I got two beds upstairs
in my spare room waiting for you.

15:34.226 --> 15:36.228
Thanks, Daddy.
It's not gonna come to that.

15:36.395 --> 15:39.314
Well, it'll be okay 'cause you called.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.109
And that's the best thing
that happened today.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.611
But also I have something to tell you.

15:44.695 --> 15:46.989
- Really? What?
- <i>Well...</i>

15:47.322 --> 15:49.241
I'm going on a trip with Shane.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.618
- No.
- <i>Really? Where?</i>

15:51.702 --> 15:55.539
<i>Well, we're just doing
some Golden Years traveling, that's all.</i>

15:55.622 --> 15:57.624
Maybe Spain. Maybe winging it.

15:57.708 --> 16:00.836
I don't really know what he thinks
going on a trip like this is.

16:00.919 --> 16:03.213
Wait. What do you mean "winging it"?

16:03.297 --> 16:07.467
Well, you know, what old people do.
We're old people. Um...

16:07.551 --> 16:08.635
Having a good time.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.387
Not caring about

16:10.721 --> 16:12.723
<i>keeping in touch
with folks or anything else.</i>

16:13.182 --> 16:14.266
Dad, are you okay?

16:14.349 --> 16:17.352
I'm okay. My stew is burning.

16:17.436 --> 16:19.271
- <i>I got to go.</i>
- Okay.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.277
Something wrong?

16:25.903 --> 16:29.072
It's Dad. He says he and Shane
are going on a trip.

16:29.448 --> 16:32.075
To Spain. Winging it.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.452
Winging it?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.829
Yeah, that's what he said.
Until they get tired.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.372
So what's the problem?

16:37.456 --> 16:40.709
Well, they're old.
Who's gonna take care of 'em?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.169
Oh, Selma!

16:42.252 --> 16:44.588
Grandpa's a grown-up
who can look after himself.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.590
- Yeah.
- And he's going with Shane,

16:46.673 --> 16:48.091
who's, like, the responsible one.

16:48.175 --> 16:52.221
I can totally see those two hooligans
scouring Spain for Spanish widows.

16:55.557 --> 16:58.310
- Um...
- Not everyone is like you, Dad.

16:59.436 --> 17:03.649
Please, just don't misinterpret my words.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.858
- It's not what I meant.
- Are you gonna say something?

17:07.861 --> 17:10.781
- Honey, it was a joke.
- A joke.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.200
- It was a joke, Tania.
- A joke. Yeah. Okay.

17:13.325 --> 17:14.576
It was a joke!

17:18.121 --> 17:20.040
- It was just a joke.
- Yeah.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.979
- Look.
- What?

17:42.145 --> 17:44.857
- Is that...
- Yes, sir. That's her.

17:45.941 --> 17:47.484
There's no cure, is there?

17:48.569 --> 17:53.031
Not for either of us, but for her,
there's a chance to slow it down.

17:53.949 --> 17:58.036
But microscopically or through
all kind of scans and everything,

17:58.120 --> 17:59.830
you can't detect it.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.291
You can only detect it after you're dead.

18:03.834 --> 18:07.004
The only way they can really diagnose it

18:08.755 --> 18:11.425
is through behavioral patterns.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.595
What's so beautiful about that, you moron?

18:14.678 --> 18:18.056
What are you talking about?
They won't catch me!

18:18.140 --> 18:21.310
Oh, beyond brain circuits
and neuron connections, huh?

18:22.728 --> 18:25.189
You don't wanna do it?
You don't wanna help me?

18:26.231 --> 18:29.276
I'll tell you what to do it for.
Do it for your cross-eyed girlfriend.

18:29.359 --> 18:33.363
Do it for every goddamn girl
that never accepted any plea from us.

18:33.447 --> 18:35.282
Don't push it, buddy.

18:35.365 --> 18:38.827
You got me to be your alibi for Selma
and that's all you're getting from me.

18:40.621 --> 18:44.374
Now, don't tell me there's more.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.711
You just got an Uber license!

18:49.087 --> 18:50.547
An Uber driver?

18:57.596 --> 19:00.474
- How do you know it's gonna work?
- I don't. It's a chance.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.683
I'm taking a chance.

19:01.767 --> 19:04.228
Something you ought
to think about doing more often.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.646
And you also have to remember

19:05.729 --> 19:10.359
that I don't remember
a goddamn thing, okay?

19:10.442 --> 19:12.778
But I need them
to put me in the dementia unit...

19:12.861 --> 19:16.073
Yeah, I'm your neighbor and friend.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.784
I tried to get in touch
with your family, but no luck,

19:18.867 --> 19:22.204
so I decided to pay for your care
myself until I can reach them.

19:22.287 --> 19:23.539
Bingo!

19:23.622 --> 19:26.333
Well, I doubt you'll be playing bingo
in the dementia unit.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.335
Oh, don't be such an asshole.

19:28.418 --> 19:31.505
I already put the money
in your account. Here's your receipt.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.006
- Ah...
- No, wait a second.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.133
You make lists about every goddamn thing.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.094
So I know you would worry about a receipt.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.429
I also have the GP report here.

19:42.641 --> 19:44.059
How did you get that?

19:44.142 --> 19:46.061
A little thing called acting.

19:47.813 --> 19:51.608
Yeah. I forgot you were
in the drama business.

19:51.692 --> 19:56.405
Well, it's the first time
I'm gonna be on the other side.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.867
Do you think they're gonna
put me in the slammer

19:59.950 --> 20:01.618
for assisting an insane person?

20:01.702 --> 20:03.495
I'm not insane.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.373
I've got Alzheimer's.

20:06.456 --> 20:07.833
Give me a break.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.085
I will get in the home.

20:10.210 --> 20:14.756
They will accept me in the home
because we're paying.

20:15.215 --> 20:17.217
And paying works.

20:21.972 --> 20:26.602
I can imagine this has been
a very painful decision for you.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.813
Oh, you can't imagine
how painful it is for me.

20:29.938 --> 20:33.358
His memory loss has been significant?

20:33.442 --> 20:36.904
Yes. Particularly since
his wife died two years ago.

20:36.987 --> 20:39.072
He's deteriorated fast.

20:39.156 --> 20:42.284
We're talking... downward spiral.

20:43.327 --> 20:47.164
I'm so sorry to hear
about your wife, Mr. Berenson.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.125
Oh, here's the GP report.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.631
This is a bank transfer receipt from...

20:55.714 --> 20:57.216
Oh! Uh...

20:57.299 --> 20:59.134
- Sorry.
- Housekeeping.

20:59.218 --> 21:01.512
Do you have the neurological test results?

21:01.595 --> 21:04.932
I'm afraid not. The tests were
scheduled for two months from now.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.892
But he can't afford to wait that long.

21:06.975 --> 21:10.020
He can't sit at home pissing
and shitting his pants the whole time.

21:10.103 --> 21:11.188
Hm-hm.

21:11.271 --> 21:14.233
And does he recognize people?

21:14.316 --> 21:18.695
Well, he recognizes me
because I'm his next-door neighbor

21:18.779 --> 21:20.030
and I see him every day.

21:20.572 --> 21:25.410
But I guess
he doesn't recognize anyone else.

21:26.203 --> 21:29.456
And what are his hobbies?
What does he like to do?

21:29.540 --> 21:32.751
He likes to drink a lot.

21:32.835 --> 21:35.003
- Anything else?
- Play chess.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.297
He plays chess?

21:38.298 --> 21:41.635
But I always beat him
'cause he thinks he's playing checkers.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.971
Sometimes I suck my thumb.

21:45.180 --> 21:48.308
Yeah, he also has
some kind of childhood regression.

21:49.268 --> 21:50.727
Totally immature.

21:51.186 --> 21:53.897
Mr. Berenson, where do you live?

21:54.731 --> 21:56.859
I live at, um...

21:56.942 --> 22:01.405
one, six, zero, zero...

22:01.488 --> 22:02.781
Uh...

22:02.906 --> 22:06.201
Pennsyl... Pennsylvania Avenue.

22:06.994 --> 22:09.913
Washington, DC.

22:09.997 --> 22:13.625
And I can't remember
the numbers after that.

22:14.251 --> 22:15.711
That's the White House.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.507
Why would you, suddenly,
wanna go to the White House?

22:20.591 --> 22:24.136
Let me explain
our community to you, Mr. McDowell.

22:24.261 --> 22:28.348
We have three units
distributed on two different floors.

22:28.432 --> 22:31.560
The general unit and the dementia unit

22:31.643 --> 22:34.104
are both on the ground floor.

22:34.188 --> 22:38.525
Patients with Alzheimer's
and other non-aggressive dementia

22:38.609 --> 22:40.235
are on the second floor.

22:40.903 --> 22:44.865
Claude, for the time being,
he'll be in our general unit.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.326
Uh, no.

22:47.409 --> 22:50.287
He really needs to be
in the dementia unit, not the general one.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.831
I mean, he's ill. He's very ill.

22:52.915 --> 22:56.043
He babbles incoherently
and shits his pants the whole time.

22:56.126 --> 22:58.837
Babbles, shits, babbles, shits,
babbles, shits.

22:58.921 --> 23:00.506
That's all he does.

23:01.215 --> 23:03.592
- Can I speak now?
- Yeah.

23:03.675 --> 23:05.928
I'd like to have Alzheimer's.

23:06.929 --> 23:08.013
Why?

23:12.142 --> 23:13.602
Wanna play a game?

23:14.520 --> 23:15.979
- Yes.
- Okay.

23:19.066 --> 23:22.486
If I show you my wiener,
you got to take your pants off.

23:23.612 --> 23:25.614
Okay.

23:26.114 --> 23:28.200
You nodded at first. She wanted to do it.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.085
I'll leave you to unpack.

23:38.168 --> 23:42.464
A nurse will be coming in a minute
to help you settle in.

23:43.006 --> 23:46.760
Anything you need,
don't hesitate to get in touch with me.

23:46.844 --> 23:47.845
- Thank you.
- Okay.

23:57.563 --> 23:58.605
What the heck are you doing?

23:58.772 --> 24:01.775
Richard Burton, Peter O'Toole

24:02.317 --> 24:06.446
had this stuff in their dressing rooms
every day of their life.

24:07.656 --> 24:10.784
Maybe it's time to forget all this.
Go home.

24:10.868 --> 24:12.911
Oh, sure, I get it.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.416
Claude, please, listen to me.

24:25.174 --> 24:28.260
I appreciate your nobleness, but I'm fine.

24:28.343 --> 24:31.513
It's not Guantanamo. I can do it.

24:31.889 --> 24:33.015
You got your pills?

24:34.349 --> 24:36.685
- Your cellphone?
- Yeah, I got my cell.

24:36.768 --> 24:38.395
Anything you need, just call.

24:38.478 --> 24:42.024
Hm? And break a leg.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.984
How about a hip?

24:44.067 --> 24:46.320
Oh.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.572
Here are your little blue pills.

24:49.323 --> 24:50.574
- For what?
- Take them.

24:51.617 --> 24:53.243
If opportunity knocks,

24:54.536 --> 24:56.705
you'll want to rise to the occasion.

24:56.788 --> 25:02.002
And inspirational cat posters
sure ain't gonna do the trick.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.883
You and me?

25:07.966 --> 25:09.593
Not gonna happen.

25:12.346 --> 25:15.807
Now take a good look
at these four items on the screen.

25:16.850 --> 25:18.393
Good morning, everyone.

25:18.477 --> 25:22.439
I'd like to introduce
our newest resident, Mr. Claude Berenson.

25:22.523 --> 25:24.483
Hi, Claude. I'm Alicia.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.485
You can have a seat right there.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.237
- There?
- No, in front.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.321
Right.

25:29.947 --> 25:34.243
So, Claude, we were just looking
at these four objects on the screen.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.787
Did everyone get a good look?

25:36.870 --> 25:38.705
Now, let's turn this off.

25:39.831 --> 25:41.500
There we go.

25:41.583 --> 25:44.378
How are we supposed
to remember them if we can't see them?

25:44.461 --> 25:47.214
That's the whole point of the game.
It's a memory game.

25:49.299 --> 25:54.721
So, Sarah, can you tell me
what object you saw on the screen?

25:56.807 --> 25:58.183
A tennis racket.

25:59.893 --> 26:02.145
- A bottle.
- Yeah.

26:03.272 --> 26:04.398
Um...

26:07.067 --> 26:08.777
- A TV set.
- Very good.

26:09.528 --> 26:10.612
Claude.

26:11.572 --> 26:12.614
Hm?

26:12.698 --> 26:14.992
Do you remember
what the fourth object was?

26:16.034 --> 26:17.077
Jell-O.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.329
No, it wasn't Jell-O.

26:19.663 --> 26:23.417
A clown
with a Richard Nixon false face on.

26:24.209 --> 26:25.919
No.

26:26.003 --> 26:27.963
Any other idea?

26:28.046 --> 26:30.257
Yeah. A comb.

26:32.259 --> 26:34.845
Very good, Claude. It was a comb!

26:44.438 --> 26:45.647
You okay, Lillian?

26:47.232 --> 26:48.317
Yes.

26:54.031 --> 26:57.075
Can you pass me the salt?

27:03.248 --> 27:06.043
One, two.

27:08.879 --> 27:10.547
You're having way too much salt.

27:10.631 --> 27:11.632
Hm-hm.

27:19.264 --> 27:20.516
Mine.

27:21.141 --> 27:23.143
This salt is mine.

27:26.271 --> 27:28.273
Can you pass me the salt?

27:28.357 --> 27:30.234
What, are you a record?

27:41.161 --> 27:43.288
How are we doing here, hm?

27:43.664 --> 27:44.915
Everything good?

27:47.084 --> 27:49.586
He's had a third of the salt shaker.

27:49.670 --> 27:53.340
Tom! You're not supposed to have the salt.

27:53.924 --> 27:55.551
It doesn't work with your heart condition.

27:55.926 --> 27:59.054
Heartbeat, heartbeat.

27:59.555 --> 28:01.014
Not for long.

28:01.765 --> 28:03.851
Everything okay, otherwise? Yeah?

28:03.934 --> 28:05.519
- Yeah.
- Good.

28:25.455 --> 28:28.000
"Good, my Lord.
I have remembrances for you."

28:28.083 --> 28:31.336
"The fair Ophelia!
Nymph in thy orisons.

28:31.420 --> 28:33.630
"Be all my sins remembered."

28:34.798 --> 28:37.176
"How does your honor for this many a day?"

28:37.259 --> 28:39.261
That was really good. Really, really good.

28:39.344 --> 28:41.430
Lucy, I think we actually dropped a line.

28:41.513 --> 28:44.057
It's like he had no idea I even existed

28:44.141 --> 28:46.727
before this whole thing
with my douchebag dad.

28:46.810 --> 28:49.188
That's because he didn't.

28:49.271 --> 28:51.523
- Thanks.
- I'm just being honest.

28:51.607 --> 28:53.859
You're not in his little theater gang.

28:53.942 --> 28:54.985
I could be.

28:55.068 --> 28:56.528
What are you gonna do?

28:56.612 --> 28:59.448
Suddenly be the lead
in the school play with all of them?

28:59.531 --> 29:01.200
Why is that so hard to imagine?

29:01.283 --> 29:05.329
Oh, just face it. You and I have
been dorks since we were kids.

29:05.412 --> 29:08.165
We're not popular. We're not losers.

29:08.248 --> 29:10.083
We're just in the middle.

29:10.167 --> 29:12.586
Yeah, well, maybe I'm sick
of being average.

29:12.669 --> 29:18.008
Well, your parents' televised scandal
is certainly taking care of that.

29:27.392 --> 29:28.685
She's a spy.

29:31.313 --> 29:34.608
Don sent that bitch
to make sure I don't talk to anybody

29:34.691 --> 29:36.944
about how he got that rezoning.

29:37.736 --> 29:41.615
- She's not a real nurse, you know.
- Who?

29:42.491 --> 29:43.992
Her!

29:44.243 --> 29:47.371
Zephyr. But I won't be signing
that affidavit.

29:47.538 --> 29:49.206
How are you doing, Miss Lillian?

29:50.457 --> 29:53.502
Do you happen to know
what a breath mint is?

30:08.809 --> 30:09.810
Hi.

30:13.063 --> 30:14.481
Might I sit?

30:19.319 --> 30:20.654
I'm Claude.

30:24.783 --> 30:26.285
You don't remember me?

30:27.452 --> 30:28.871
Claude Berenson.

30:31.373 --> 30:33.041
I'm a theater critic.

30:33.125 --> 30:37.588
I reviewed so many
of your fabulous performances.

30:37.796 --> 30:41.508
I saw your Medea. That was magnificent.

30:42.384 --> 30:44.636
Pure. Honest.

30:45.137 --> 30:49.683
Your Blanche DuBois,
certainly the best I ever saw.

30:49.766 --> 30:52.060
A lot of people think
it's the greatest Blanche

30:52.144 --> 30:54.271
that anybody ever played.

30:59.109 --> 31:00.903
Lily, it's me.

31:02.279 --> 31:03.614
Claude.

31:20.881 --> 31:22.174
See?

31:24.968 --> 31:27.346
Are they your children?

31:29.139 --> 31:32.059
No, that's you and me.

31:32.142 --> 31:34.645
In 1978.

31:35.521 --> 31:38.357
Shakespeare. Winter's Tale.

31:38.440 --> 31:41.777
At the Palace Theater. In New York!

31:43.737 --> 31:45.364
You don't remember that?

31:47.032 --> 31:49.451
You remember who took the picture?

31:49.535 --> 31:52.871
Sir John Gielgud was kind enough.

31:54.331 --> 31:57.334
And then he invited
the whole cast to dinner.

31:57.918 --> 31:59.753
You and I started talking.

32:00.546 --> 32:04.675
And we really kind of
got into a conversation deep,

32:04.758 --> 32:07.678
kind of started getting into each other

32:07.761 --> 32:10.389
and, suddenly, we noticed
we were all by ourselves.

32:10.472 --> 32:12.266
Everybody had gone home.

32:13.058 --> 32:17.938
And then you and I went
to the Park Central Hotel

32:19.064 --> 32:21.400
and we stayed all night.

32:21.775 --> 32:24.778
We spent every night together.

32:24.862 --> 32:27.948
Every night for weeks and weeks.

32:28.949 --> 32:31.076
You don't remember that?

32:31.577 --> 32:33.120
Yeah, it's me.

32:33.203 --> 32:35.205
Oh, please, keep looking at me.

32:35.956 --> 32:39.334
No, I'm the same guy.

32:39.543 --> 32:41.295
I haven't changed.

32:41.670 --> 32:45.299
I'm a little grumpier and more
of an asshole than I was before probably.

32:46.300 --> 32:49.344
But I still have all the same passion.

32:49.428 --> 32:54.057
And I care about you, Lily, still.

32:57.686 --> 32:58.854
Hello.

33:04.651 --> 33:08.197
I'm Claude. I have Alzheimer's.

33:09.281 --> 33:11.325
Do you two know each other?

33:17.706 --> 33:19.958
I don't remember things very well.

33:25.422 --> 33:27.466
- Shane.
- <i>Haven't you killed yourself?</i>

33:27.549 --> 33:31.345
Get over that, will you, please?
I have not killed myself.

33:31.428 --> 33:34.348
- But I do need a couple of things.
- <i>Okay.</i>

33:34.431 --> 33:36.725
- Get a pen.
- <i>Okay.</i>

33:36.850 --> 33:42.064
Write it down. I need some lilies
and I need two Gershwin CDs.

33:42.147 --> 33:44.149
<i>Well, why? Why?</i>

33:44.233 --> 33:46.527
Because that's
her favorite music, okay?

33:46.610 --> 33:51.198
Gershwin. Two of those CDs
and six bunches of flowers.

33:51.281 --> 33:52.908
<i>Does she remember you?</i>

33:52.991 --> 33:56.578
No, she doesn't remember me yet,
but I'm getting there.

33:59.289 --> 34:00.374
I got to go.

34:03.710 --> 34:06.171
Mr. Berenson, it's shower time.

34:07.130 --> 34:08.340
What's a shower?

34:08.966 --> 34:11.426
Claude, let's not play this game.

34:11.510 --> 34:14.679
All right, get back there.
Get around the front.

34:15.264 --> 34:17.431
I can do this.

34:17.516 --> 34:19.141
I don't mind, sir. It's my job.

34:19.226 --> 34:21.853
Come on, it's not your job. It's my job.

34:21.937 --> 34:23.897
No, it's no trouble at all.

34:25.274 --> 34:27.192
Just give me the brush.

34:28.777 --> 34:31.237
- Okay.
- Out.

34:31.321 --> 34:33.614
- All right.
- O-U-T means out.

34:33.699 --> 34:36.784
I'll be back to check on you
in five minutes, sir.

34:39.371 --> 34:42.498
<i>Oh, my darling</i>

34:42.583 --> 34:44.877
<i>Oh, my darling, Clementine</i>

34:44.960 --> 34:48.213
<i>You were lost and gone forever</i>

34:48.297 --> 34:51.425
<i>Dreaded sorrow, Clementine</i>

34:51.507 --> 34:54.844
<i>Oh, my darling</i>

34:54.928 --> 34:57.639
<i>Oh, my darling, Clementine</i>

34:57.723 --> 35:00.517
<i>You were lost and gone forever</i>

35:00.601 --> 35:06.315
<i>Precious darling, Clementine</i>

35:12.946 --> 35:15.199
You all sang so beautifully!

35:15.282 --> 35:17.576
And, you, Donahue, you played marvelously.

35:17.659 --> 35:19.578
Thank you!

35:20.537 --> 35:24.208
And remember, next week,
there will be a magician coming!

35:24.291 --> 35:27.377
I love magicians. They're so magical!

35:35.802 --> 35:37.221
Wow, Lillian!

35:38.388 --> 35:40.182
- Oh.
- These are so beautiful.

35:40.265 --> 35:44.478
- What's that?
- They're lilies.

35:45.479 --> 35:47.564
Peter really outdid himself.

35:53.779 --> 35:55.572
Lily Blanche.

35:56.281 --> 35:57.574
It's for me.

35:58.492 --> 35:59.826
Is it a note?

36:17.135 --> 36:19.930
A CD. I'll play this.

36:21.181 --> 36:25.644
"Doubt thou the stars are fire."

36:29.690 --> 36:34.152
"Doubt thou the stars are fire."

36:36.113 --> 36:40.659
<i>Embrace me
My sweet embraceable you</i>

36:41.618 --> 36:43.328
<i>Embrace me</i>

36:43.412 --> 36:48.542
<i>You irreplaceable you</i>

36:48.625 --> 36:50.836
<i>Just one look at you</i>

36:50.919 --> 36:55.591
<i>My heart grew tipsy in me</i>

36:55.674 --> 36:58.093
<i>You and you alone</i>

36:58.177 --> 37:03.140
<i>Bring out the gypsy in me</i>

37:03.640 --> 37:08.979
<i>I love all the many charms about you...</i>

37:14.026 --> 37:16.111
Are these your children?

37:17.905 --> 37:21.074
Lily, no. They're, um...

37:21.158 --> 37:22.743
They look happy.

37:23.702 --> 37:24.912
They are.

37:25.579 --> 37:26.997
They were.

37:27.706 --> 37:29.458
They still can be.

37:34.379 --> 37:37.674
They never really had
a lot of time together

37:38.467 --> 37:44.139
because he was only near her
when her shows would come to New York.

37:45.474 --> 37:48.143
And every night, they would stay together,

37:48.227 --> 37:51.813
and he would take her
to the jazz clubs in the Village,

37:51.897 --> 37:55.317
he would take her to nice restaurants.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.904
She liked to go up to
the tall buildings, the skyscrapers.

37:59.821 --> 38:02.324
And one night, they went to a club.

38:02.407 --> 38:06.119
And the band leader knew him.

38:06.286 --> 38:08.288
And all of a sudden,

38:08.372 --> 38:13.502
they started playing
her favorite Gershwin song.

38:14.127 --> 38:16.129
"Embraceable You."

38:17.714 --> 38:20.384
"Embraceable You."

38:20.509 --> 38:23.053
And she was ecstatic.

38:23.178 --> 38:26.139
And then she went back

38:26.223 --> 38:27.933
to be with her husband.

38:28.809 --> 38:32.980
Every now and then,
he would just... Couldn't stand the fact

38:33.063 --> 38:35.607
that he couldn't see her,
be with her, touch her.

38:36.441 --> 38:39.611
One day, he summoned up enough courage

38:39.695 --> 38:42.948
to ask her to run away with him.

38:44.950 --> 38:46.952
And she wasn't surprised.

38:48.370 --> 38:50.455
She wasn't surprised.

38:50.539 --> 38:52.958
It was almost as if she expected it.

38:53.041 --> 38:55.085
She said, "Give me some time.

38:55.169 --> 38:59.173
"I have to go and explain to my husband.
I can't just tell him."

39:01.550 --> 39:04.803
And then, she stopped writing.

39:07.014 --> 39:09.433
Stopped taking his calls.

39:11.435 --> 39:13.187
And he...

39:15.355 --> 39:18.066
flew over to Paris

39:18.775 --> 39:20.277
to see her.

39:21.195 --> 39:23.572
To try to see her.

40:06.365 --> 40:09.034
And so finally
he just threw in the towel.

40:10.244 --> 40:11.870
He met another woman.

40:13.121 --> 40:14.414
Another woman?

40:16.750 --> 40:17.918
Yeah.

40:20.546 --> 40:21.922
Just moved on.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.092
Then, one day, came a letter.

40:26.176 --> 40:27.845
And in the letter,

40:27.928 --> 40:32.182
the key phrase was, "Doubt thou

40:32.975 --> 40:35.853
"the stars are fire."

40:37.521 --> 40:41.024
Shakespeare's most beautiful words.

40:41.108 --> 40:45.654
Soon after that, the only stuff
he ever heard about her anymore

40:45.737 --> 40:47.531
was what he read in the newspaper.

41:03.213 --> 41:04.923
They seem happy.

41:37.414 --> 41:42.503
<i>Embrace me, you irreplaceable you</i>

41:42.586 --> 41:45.130
You, too, Rosie?
I cannot shake this damn song.

41:45.214 --> 41:47.257
She can't stop playing it
in her room.

41:47.341 --> 41:49.843
You're not getting paid to sing. Go. Work.

41:49.927 --> 41:53.055
- Thank you. Bye.
- Don't be a naughty baby.

42:55.659 --> 42:57.327
Are you sure you wanna do this?

42:57.411 --> 42:58.745
What choice do I have?

42:58.829 --> 43:00.706
It's either this or kill myself.

43:00.789 --> 43:02.332
Why don't you just give it a minute?

43:02.416 --> 43:05.210
The scandal will die down
and everyone at school will forget it.

43:05.294 --> 43:07.212
I'm not waiting for this to blow over.

43:07.754 --> 43:10.465
What am I supposed
to say when your parents call me?

43:11.466 --> 43:13.010
Tell them what I told you.

43:13.594 --> 43:15.179
I took a bus to New York.

43:17.890 --> 43:19.433
I don't want you to go.

43:19.516 --> 43:21.018
I'll be fine.

43:29.026 --> 43:31.236
This place. Okay?

43:32.321 --> 43:35.157
Yeah, it's better than okay. I like it.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.909
It's much better than I thought.

43:37.534 --> 43:39.870
Everybody's kind of...
There's no egos around.

43:39.953 --> 43:44.750
And everybody's...
kind of laid back and calm.

43:44.833 --> 43:47.044
- It makes me feel young.
- Hm.

43:53.300 --> 43:54.843
They don't get on your nerves?

43:54.927 --> 43:56.053
No.

43:57.095 --> 43:58.597
Actually, it's the opposite.

43:58.680 --> 44:02.935
We have kind of a...
I don't know, a camaraderie.

44:03.477 --> 44:05.562
And it's kind of touching, actually.

44:05.646 --> 44:08.815
Well, I guess you're all in the same boat.

44:08.899 --> 44:10.859
We're certainly all in the same diapers.

44:14.530 --> 44:15.739
Miss the family?

44:17.741 --> 44:18.784
Not really.

44:18.867 --> 44:21.411
I mean, I haven't heard from them

44:21.495 --> 44:24.790
since I've been in so-called Spain.

44:24.873 --> 44:26.500
You remember one day,

44:26.583 --> 44:29.586
well, you were there several days,
when my daughter yells out at me,

44:29.670 --> 44:34.132
"Don't forget, Daddy,
to carry your cellphone with you

44:34.216 --> 44:36.552
"in case I need you."

44:36.635 --> 44:38.595
Didn't mean shit. She never called.

44:39.805 --> 44:41.390
Did you bring me something?

44:42.516 --> 44:44.643
Yeah. Booze.

44:45.394 --> 44:47.396
And some seasonings and spices.

44:48.897 --> 44:50.816
You know, the food here sucks.

44:50.899 --> 44:53.569
They make us eat a soup every day.

44:53.652 --> 44:55.445
Tastes like the back of a stamp.

44:55.529 --> 44:57.823
Well, that's what you get
for being a masochist.

44:58.949 --> 45:03.704
So, any progress with Lillian?

45:04.955 --> 45:08.500
Is she still not remembering
your resistible charms?

45:09.084 --> 45:10.335
Not yet.

45:11.420 --> 45:13.589
I'm working on her hard.

45:13.672 --> 45:15.591
It is harder than I thought,

45:15.674 --> 45:18.177
but we're getting more time together

45:18.260 --> 45:22.514
and there is still a chemistry, trust me.

45:22.598 --> 45:23.891
Is she here?

45:29.855 --> 45:32.149
It's so good to see you
looking so much happier.

45:32.816 --> 45:35.652
- Who's the fella?
- Her brother.

45:35.736 --> 45:36.945
I love you.

45:41.575 --> 45:45.579
- Oh. They must be close.
- Hmm.

45:47.664 --> 45:49.917
- Well, yes.
- Hi, Peter.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.585
How did you find her today?

45:52.336 --> 45:56.215
A little more cheerful
than usual, actually.

45:56.965 --> 45:59.968
Isn't she? It must be the flowers
you've been sending her.

46:00.636 --> 46:02.596
Flowers? What flowers?

46:02.679 --> 46:04.932
The lilies. That isn't you?

46:05.015 --> 46:09.770
- Maybe your wife has a secret admirer.
- Well, she has plenty of fans.

46:09.853 --> 46:12.523
Some of them even write
to our home address.

46:12.606 --> 46:16.818
Those awful tabloid newspapers
are to blame.

46:16.902 --> 46:20.113
- Well, I'll see you next week.
- Yes.

46:20.197 --> 46:21.657
Bye, Peter.

46:21.740 --> 46:24.701
"Your wife." She said, "Your wife."

46:24.785 --> 46:26.453
I heard her perfectly.

46:26.537 --> 46:27.746
I don't think I know you.

46:27.829 --> 46:30.874
Stop! Did you know?

46:30.958 --> 46:33.585
Why did you tell me he was dead?
How could you lie to me like that?

46:33.669 --> 46:34.795
How could I tell you?

46:34.878 --> 46:36.630
Every time you run a yellow light,

46:36.713 --> 46:40.008
you go rushing
for a goddamn priest to confess it.

46:40.092 --> 46:42.135
You would have never helped me,
would you have?

46:42.219 --> 46:43.762
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

46:43.846 --> 46:47.140
I insist you leave this place right away!

46:47.224 --> 46:48.934
Can't you see what you're doing

46:49.017 --> 46:52.062
is immoral, intrusive
and probably illegal?

46:52.145 --> 46:55.941
I love her. Her husband does not love her.
Not like I do.

46:56.024 --> 46:57.693
How the hell do you know
how much he loves her?

46:57.776 --> 47:00.070
Because no husband
who really loves his wife

47:00.153 --> 47:02.072
is gonna leave her in a dump like this

47:02.155 --> 47:04.950
and only come see her twice a month!

47:05.033 --> 47:08.036
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here.

47:08.120 --> 47:09.454
Suit yourself.

47:09.538 --> 47:13.834
But don't expect any more booze
or any more favors from me.

47:13.917 --> 47:17.004
And I won't be making
any more monthly payments!

47:17.087 --> 47:18.463
You're on your own.

47:20.174 --> 47:23.927
I cannot be an accomplice
to this felony any longer.

47:24.011 --> 47:26.972
You keep bragging about
your cross-eyed girlfriend, you know,

47:27.055 --> 47:28.891
that had the wonderful laugh or smile

47:29.016 --> 47:30.726
or I don't know what the hell it was.

47:30.809 --> 47:33.187
I know now why she didn't ever kiss you.

47:48.285 --> 47:49.828
Sorry about that, ma'am.

48:16.396 --> 48:17.397
Ugh.

48:54.685 --> 48:55.769
Are you sure?

48:55.853 --> 48:58.397
I called the senior living place
and they confirmed it.

49:00.774 --> 49:03.277
What were you doing at his house?

49:05.779 --> 49:08.156
And why did you take your travel bags?

49:08.240 --> 49:09.700
It doesn't matter.

49:09.783 --> 49:12.661
I tried to call Shane,
but I didn't have his number.

49:13.370 --> 49:15.664
How could he not tell me?

49:16.707 --> 49:18.667
Maybe he didn't wanna upset you.

49:18.750 --> 49:22.171
He's always like that.
He's always keeping things to himself.

49:22.254 --> 49:25.090
But I don't understand. Alzheimer's?

49:25.174 --> 49:27.843
He's always so sharp.

49:27.926 --> 49:30.929
I realize
that this may sound a little harsh.

49:31.013 --> 49:32.931
- But it kind of makes sense now.
- What?

49:33.015 --> 49:37.352
Yeah, we all said he was getting
a little more ornery after Helen died,

49:37.436 --> 49:39.730
but the truth is
he was being very obnoxious,

49:39.813 --> 49:42.441
at least with me, and I mean before the...

49:42.524 --> 49:43.817
It doesn't matter.

49:45.319 --> 49:48.280
He blamed me for global warming,
Selma, for Christ's sake.

49:50.073 --> 49:54.828
But I guess it wasn't his fault,
you know? Poor guy.

49:56.538 --> 49:58.665
That's it.

49:58.749 --> 50:02.836
- Very good. I'll take one.
- Uh-huh.

50:03.712 --> 50:06.798
It might be a bit of a shock
for him to see you,

50:06.882 --> 50:09.885
so try to be not too disruptive.

50:10.928 --> 50:12.012
Claude?

50:12.095 --> 50:13.764
Look who's here.

50:17.518 --> 50:18.644
Hey, Daddy.

50:26.735 --> 50:29.446
You see? He's happy to see you.

50:31.323 --> 50:32.658
You...

50:35.869 --> 50:37.120
You're doing a jigsaw?

50:40.666 --> 50:42.376
Are you sure you're okay here?

50:42.459 --> 50:43.585
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

50:43.669 --> 50:45.254
- Why?
- Well...

50:45.838 --> 50:47.506
Are they treating you well?

50:48.757 --> 50:50.092
- Yes.
- Okay.

50:50.676 --> 50:52.970
Aren't you bothered by the other patients?

50:54.096 --> 50:56.139
I mean, we know how you like your space.

50:56.223 --> 50:58.100
No, they're fine.

50:58.183 --> 51:01.186
You got to miss your home.

51:01.270 --> 51:03.814
- Your library.
- Huh?

51:03.897 --> 51:05.649
Your books. Don't you miss 'em?

51:05.732 --> 51:07.317
What books?

51:10.279 --> 51:11.780
We miss your cooking.

51:12.614 --> 51:15.450
Okay, we're gonna come and we're
gonna bust you out of here one day,

51:15.534 --> 51:18.662
take you back to our house
and you can destroy the kitchen.

51:18.745 --> 51:19.872
- Huh, Tania?
- Yeah.

51:19.955 --> 51:21.415
How's the food here?

51:21.498 --> 51:23.709
- Good.
- Good?

51:23.792 --> 51:26.837
Are you sure? You used
to badmouth five-star restaurants.

51:28.589 --> 51:31.008
Stars? It's daytime.

51:33.427 --> 51:36.638
You guys...
I'm gonna go see the supervisor.

51:38.932 --> 51:40.184
Come on, Grandpa.

51:41.018 --> 51:42.394
I don't understand.

51:43.604 --> 51:46.231
A few weeks ago, he was lucid enough

51:46.315 --> 51:48.442
to give me advice, just as he always did,

51:48.525 --> 51:52.613
and he tells me that he's going on a trip

51:53.197 --> 51:56.575
with his friend and they're winging it.

51:58.243 --> 52:01.330
So now he's here with Alzheimer's.

52:01.413 --> 52:03.790
Perhaps he was simply telling you

52:03.874 --> 52:07.544
about a trip he made
with a friend many years ago.

52:10.047 --> 52:14.301
Truth be told,
I've had some problems at home.

52:14.384 --> 52:15.511
But it's not an excuse.

52:15.719 --> 52:21.725
I hope you have the time
for your father now, Mrs. Addison,

52:21.892 --> 52:26.438
because he's going to need
your attention and your affection

52:26.647 --> 52:28.273
more than ever.

52:31.568 --> 52:33.862
Nice and relaxing here, huh, Grandpa?

52:38.659 --> 52:40.327
So what movies do you watch?

52:43.455 --> 52:44.915
<i>No Country for Old Men?</i>

52:50.796 --> 52:52.923
So what games do they have?

52:53.006 --> 52:54.925
Not spin the bottle, I guess.

52:56.260 --> 52:58.679
Card games? Dominoes?

53:00.806 --> 53:01.849
Yeah?

53:10.691 --> 53:13.819
You don't get half of what I say, do you?

53:18.949 --> 53:22.327
What about books? Anything interesting?

53:26.123 --> 53:29.126
God! No wonder you lose neurons here!

53:34.631 --> 53:36.133
Don't worry, Grandpa.

53:36.216 --> 53:38.051
I'm gonna smuggle in the good stuff.

53:40.429 --> 53:41.555
Cognac?

53:42.055 --> 53:43.140
Cognac?

53:44.766 --> 53:46.852
There's the old Grandpa I know.

53:47.436 --> 53:48.520
You want some cognac?

53:49.897 --> 53:51.982
Old-time cognac.

53:52.316 --> 53:53.609
Vintage.

53:58.906 --> 54:02.576
You know, you kind of
ruined my plan to run away.

54:08.123 --> 54:12.586
He barely recognized me.
He couldn't even name Tania.

54:12.669 --> 54:15.964
Oh, no. What did the doctors say?

54:16.048 --> 54:20.052
That it's Alzheimer's
and some sort of childhood regression.

54:20.677 --> 54:21.929
Wow.

54:22.012 --> 54:23.805
You know how he is about his books.

54:23.972 --> 54:25.015
Yeah.

54:25.766 --> 54:27.976
I remember one time I didn't return a book

54:28.060 --> 54:30.187
and he put a rotten shrimp in my glovebox.

54:31.021 --> 54:33.524
He probably doesn't even
remember them now.

54:34.316 --> 54:35.400
Really?

54:37.694 --> 54:39.321
He might not even remember me.

54:40.489 --> 54:42.157
Or how much he hates me.

54:46.036 --> 54:48.705
This is very nice. Very nice.

54:48.789 --> 54:52.626
Hm-hm.
Our residents are very comfortable here.

54:52.709 --> 54:56.713
Almost as if they were
in their own living room.

54:56.797 --> 55:00.384
Well, a lot of us would kill to have
a living room like this, Mrs. Marcos.

55:00.467 --> 55:03.053
- Oh, thank you.
- Look at this natural light.

55:03.178 --> 55:06.723
- This is beautiful. You think so?
- Yeah, absolutely.

55:06.807 --> 55:08.642
Hey, cutie.

55:08.725 --> 55:09.935
Who are you?

55:10.561 --> 55:13.814
Well, I'm David. And who are you?

55:14.356 --> 55:16.859
You know damn well who I am.

55:16.942 --> 55:19.653
Don sent you to spy on me, didn't he?

55:20.654 --> 55:22.155
Sarah, please.

55:22.739 --> 55:25.033
I know there's a camera in that thing.

55:25.117 --> 55:27.202
I'm sorry. Who?

55:27.286 --> 55:31.248
Don! Tell him
to stick the affidavit up his ass.

55:31.373 --> 55:35.752
Come on, Sarah. Leave Mr. Addison alone.

55:36.753 --> 55:39.381
He came to see his father-in-law.

55:42.217 --> 55:43.468
Claude?

55:47.264 --> 55:48.432
Claude?

55:48.515 --> 55:52.227
It's... Hey, whoa! Where are you going?

55:52.895 --> 55:56.690
Remember me? How are you?
How are you doing in here, buddy?

55:57.900 --> 55:59.776
Your son-in-law. David.

56:00.444 --> 56:01.862
With a "D"?

56:02.779 --> 56:04.698
David with a "D," yeah.

56:08.118 --> 56:09.870
So you don't recognize me at all?

56:14.041 --> 56:17.377
You always hated my guts.
You remember that?

56:18.295 --> 56:22.591
I wanted to say that I'm very sorry
for what's happened to you.

56:24.259 --> 56:27.721
You were a real pain in my ass,
but I never wanted to beat you this way.

56:28.388 --> 56:31.683
I don't want your illness
to wipe my slate clean.

56:32.059 --> 56:34.937
I want us to pick up
right where we left off.

56:35.020 --> 56:37.064
Turn this whole thing around.

56:37.856 --> 56:41.818
I want us to be a real family this time.

56:43.946 --> 56:45.906
Selma's gonna forgive me, too.

56:51.245 --> 56:52.329
Hello?

56:53.038 --> 56:55.749
Worse comes to worst, I'll take Florida.

57:12.641 --> 57:17.229
At the desk is a guy who's asking for you

57:17.312 --> 57:21.024
and he looks very suspicious
and a bit dangerous.

57:21.233 --> 57:22.651
God!

57:23.652 --> 57:26.071
Thank you for the warning. Oh, God!

57:41.879 --> 57:43.589
<i>At my request he would not.</i>

57:43.672 --> 57:47.384
<i>Hermione, my dearest,
thou never spokest to better purpose.</i>

57:47.467 --> 57:50.387
- <i>Never?</i>
- <i>Never, but once.</i>

57:50.470 --> 57:53.223
<i>What! Have I twice said well?</i>

57:53.932 --> 57:55.392
<i>When was't before?</i>

57:57.227 --> 57:59.062
<i>I prithee tell me,</i>

57:59.146 --> 58:03.025
<i>cram's with praise
and make's as fat as tame things:</i>

58:03.108 --> 58:05.694
<i>one good deed, dying tongueless,</i>

58:05.777 --> 58:08.363
<i>slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</i>

58:08.447 --> 58:11.033
<i>Our praises are our wages:</i>

58:11.116 --> 58:13.827
<i>you may ride's with one soft kiss</i>

58:16.121 --> 58:21.168
<i>a thousand furlongs ere
with spur we beat an acre.</i>

58:21.251 --> 58:22.836
<i>But to the goal.</i>

58:24.213 --> 58:27.174
<i>My last good deed was to entreat his stay.</i>

58:27.257 --> 58:29.259
<i>What was my first?</i>

58:29.343 --> 58:31.053
<i>It has an elder sister...</i>

58:32.387 --> 58:34.515
You used my dad for a PR stunt.

58:34.765 --> 58:36.058
<i>That was not me, Selma.</i>

58:36.141 --> 58:37.935
No. He'd never let you take that picture.

58:38.018 --> 58:40.437
I swear on my mother's grave.

58:40.521 --> 58:43.315
That had to be somebody
from the old-folks' staff.

58:43.398 --> 58:47.402
You know they're underpaid, they see
the opportunity to make a few bucks.

58:47.528 --> 58:50.030
That's the only explanation I can find.

58:50.113 --> 58:53.951
I mean, I'm just
as pissed off as you, trust me.

58:54.034 --> 58:56.161
You took advantage of him. It wasn't?

58:56.453 --> 58:57.704
Is that your wife?

58:59.039 --> 59:01.667
- We can sue them if you want.
- <i>No.</i>

59:01.750 --> 59:04.127
I don't want any more publicity.

59:06.672 --> 59:07.714
Uh...

59:07.840 --> 59:11.009
Listen, I swear I had nothing to do
with it, and if you wanna sue them,

59:11.093 --> 59:13.804
<i>I will call my lawyer immediately.</i>

59:25.649 --> 59:26.984
To you.

59:33.198 --> 59:35.868
Mom's putting on a pathetic show,

59:36.493 --> 59:38.871
pretending everything is all right.

59:40.539 --> 59:44.293
That your husband is boning whores
and you act like you don't know.

59:44.877 --> 59:47.045
As if all that isn't enough,

59:48.547 --> 59:50.424
everyone at school knows.

59:51.800 --> 59:54.011
They all laugh at me and...

59:54.553 --> 59:57.014
Logan doesn't even know me and...

59:58.473 --> 01:00:00.142
now you're like this.

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:04.813
I just wanna leave this town and...

01:00:04.897 --> 01:00:07.566
You can't get upset at that, please.

01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:10.444
But Dad wants us to go to Florida.

01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:14.156
Why? Why would you go to Florida?

01:00:15.449 --> 01:00:18.702
- To stay?
- Grandpa...

01:00:19.745 --> 01:00:21.288
Are you understanding me?

01:00:21.955 --> 01:00:23.081
Huh?

01:00:23.707 --> 01:00:28.462
Grandpa, do you, like,
go in and out of Alzheimer's?

01:00:35.093 --> 01:00:37.554
I don't have Alzheimer's, babe.

01:00:38.889 --> 01:00:40.933
I faked my way into this place.

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:44.603
I've never had it
and I'm not gonna have it.

01:00:45.354 --> 01:00:46.688
And I'm fine.

01:00:47.564 --> 01:00:48.774
What?

01:00:49.525 --> 01:00:51.193
Why would you do that?

01:00:51.818 --> 01:00:56.240
Because there's someone
who needs me very much.

01:00:56.782 --> 01:00:58.659
- Who?
- She was my first love.

01:01:00.869 --> 01:01:04.373
And now she's here.

01:01:05.582 --> 01:01:07.042
Here.

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:09.378
And she has Alzheimer's.

01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:17.719
I don't know what to say. I mean...

01:01:19.596 --> 01:01:21.557
So it was before Grandma?

01:01:23.642 --> 01:01:25.394
Yes, way before Grandma.

01:01:25.936 --> 01:01:27.563
Oh, God!

01:01:32.317 --> 01:01:34.862
I need you to do us both a big favor.

01:01:35.654 --> 01:01:37.030
What?

01:01:37.906 --> 01:01:40.826
You have to keep this a secret.

01:01:41.535 --> 01:01:44.580
Only if you promise
not to tell Mom and Dad

01:01:44.663 --> 01:01:46.123
that I was trying to run away.

01:01:46.999 --> 01:01:48.584
Deal?

01:01:49.585 --> 01:01:50.752
Deal.

01:01:51.628 --> 01:01:53.964
I'm so happy you have fake Alzheimer's.

01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:59.845
I mean, it's incredibly weird
and possibly illegal, but... still.

01:02:01.013 --> 01:02:05.517
A theater company comes
to put on a play for the residents.

01:02:05.642 --> 01:02:07.144
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:02:07.227 --> 01:02:09.897
And I'm making sure it's a specific one.

01:02:11.607 --> 01:02:13.025
This one.

01:02:13.775 --> 01:02:14.818
Ah.

01:02:14.902 --> 01:02:16.486
<i>The Winter's Tale.</i>

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:20.199
That was
Lillian's greatest performance ever.

01:02:20.782 --> 01:02:22.367
And there's my plan.

01:02:23.368 --> 01:02:25.454
Your plan? For what?

01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:28.373
To make her try and remember me.

01:02:31.168 --> 01:02:33.629
"My dearest Claude.

01:02:34.379 --> 01:02:36.798
"I am writing to you

01:02:36.882 --> 01:02:41.970
"more hastily than I would like
and you deserve,

01:02:42.596 --> 01:02:47.392
"as the little time I have
between rehearsals

01:02:47.476 --> 01:02:50.312
"is filled with interviews

01:02:50.395 --> 01:02:53.941
"for radio stations and the press.

01:02:54.525 --> 01:02:59.112
"And this only adds to my frustration

01:02:59.196 --> 01:03:01.990
"for not having you here with me

01:03:02.991 --> 01:03:04.743
"because everything,

01:03:04.826 --> 01:03:09.915
"absolutely everything reminds me of you.

01:03:12.626 --> 01:03:14.127
"You know what?

01:03:14.795 --> 01:03:18.507
"I've come to the cafe
where we always meet

01:03:19.258 --> 01:03:21.468
"when you come to Paris."

01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:23.512
Paris!

01:03:24.137 --> 01:03:25.222
Hmm.

01:03:25.806 --> 01:03:27.641
"Apart from my Earl Grey,

01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:30.143
"I've ordered the cognac...

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:37.150
"...you usually have after your coffee.

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:42.239
"So when I put my lips on the glass,

01:03:43.282 --> 01:03:48.453
"I try to feel
that I'm putting them to yours,

01:03:48.537 --> 01:03:52.457
"the only place where my lips
really feel alive,

01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:57.129
"capable of igniting my whole body.

01:03:58.589 --> 01:04:02.801
"So, you see, I look for you

01:04:03.594 --> 01:04:07.139
"even in the most impossible places...

01:04:08.473 --> 01:04:12.728
"...in every shadow, in my dreams,

01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:15.189
"in every theater stall.

01:04:15.856 --> 01:04:19.318
"And I feel like I'm glowing,

01:04:19.401 --> 01:04:22.070
"not from the lines I recite

01:04:22.154 --> 01:04:25.490
"or the spotlights all around me,

01:04:25.574 --> 01:04:28.493
"but from the strength I get

01:04:28.577 --> 01:04:32.748
"from knowing that you are thinking of me,

01:04:33.832 --> 01:04:35.375
"reading me,

01:04:35.459 --> 01:04:39.838
"listening to me, feeling me.

01:04:41.507 --> 01:04:44.510
"Please, come very soon.

01:04:46.386 --> 01:04:49.306
"All my love, Lily."

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:04.196
This letter is for you, isn't it?

01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:06.823
- Yes.
- You are Claude.

01:05:11.119 --> 01:05:13.038
And her name is Lillian.

01:05:14.373 --> 01:05:15.541
Lily.

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:18.919
Hmm.

01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:23.257
Is that why you spend
so much time with me?

01:05:23.632 --> 01:05:26.260
Because I remind you of her?

01:05:26.343 --> 01:05:28.011
That's exactly why.

01:05:28.262 --> 01:05:29.346
Ah.

01:05:30.764 --> 01:05:32.891
And why can't you be with her?

01:05:34.142 --> 01:05:35.561
She was married.

01:05:36.937 --> 01:05:38.772
I don't think she ever...

01:05:39.648 --> 01:05:44.403
ever wanted to get a divorce.

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:48.574
She chickened out.
I hate people who chicken out.

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:57.165
Oh!

01:06:08.969 --> 01:06:12.306
Lily, come on. Let's go. It's raining.

01:06:12.431 --> 01:06:13.974
Let's go inside.

01:06:15.475 --> 01:06:17.477
Claude, come on! It's raining!

01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:19.938
- Come inside!
- I like the rain.

01:06:21.815 --> 01:06:23.192
Come on. Let's go inside.

01:06:41.543 --> 01:06:44.880
Hey, why don't you ask Logan
and his gang of theater geeks?

01:06:45.005 --> 01:06:47.716
- I don't wanna interrupt his clique.
- Oh, why not?

01:06:47.799 --> 01:06:49.551
They all seem so lovely.

01:06:49.635 --> 01:06:52.262
What is she wearing now?
Like, what is that?

01:06:53.931 --> 01:06:56.225
She is so lame! Like her dad.

01:06:56.308 --> 01:06:57.935
Oh, my God. Don't turn around.

01:06:59.478 --> 01:07:01.230
I said don't turn around!

01:07:01.897 --> 01:07:03.023
He's coming over here.

01:07:06.693 --> 01:07:08.403
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:07:09.238 --> 01:07:10.405
Yeah, hey.

01:07:11.365 --> 01:07:15.369
I just wanted
to apologize about my friends.

01:07:16.453 --> 01:07:17.871
They can be idiots.

01:07:18.539 --> 01:07:20.832
Oh, we didn't even notice anything.

01:07:20.916 --> 01:07:23.043
Sorry to interrupt.

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:24.878
Hey.

01:07:24.962 --> 01:07:26.463
You do acting, right?

01:07:28.465 --> 01:07:30.384
I've been in a couple of plays, yeah.

01:07:30.509 --> 01:07:34.847
Yeah, we saw you in Our Town
and you were amazing.

01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:36.557
Thank you.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:40.686
Anyway, Tania wanted
to ask you something.

01:07:45.566 --> 01:07:46.859
Yes?

01:07:50.571 --> 01:07:52.322
What's going on with Florida?

01:07:52.406 --> 01:07:54.867
I don't know.
Dad's still campaigning for us to go.

01:07:54.992 --> 01:07:59.121
And Mom isn't putting up
much of a fight, so...

01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:01.456
She never even mentioned it to me.

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:04.168
That's because she thinks
you have Alzheimer's, Grandpa.

01:08:04.251 --> 01:08:05.919
Oh.

01:08:06.003 --> 01:08:09.464
I found a theater company.
Everything's taken care of.

01:08:09.548 --> 01:08:10.674
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:08:10.757 --> 01:08:15.179
- Which one?
- Oh, well, a very special one.

01:08:15.262 --> 01:08:16.970
- You'll see.
- Spare no expense.

01:08:17.055 --> 01:08:20.350
Props, costumes, lighting.

01:08:21.143 --> 01:08:22.394
The whole proscenium.

01:08:22.477 --> 01:08:24.313
Their <i>Winter's Tale</i>
will give you goosebumps.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:30.986
All right. Bye.

01:08:33.238 --> 01:08:35.823
Sorry, guys. The gig's off.

01:08:36.408 --> 01:08:39.703
I just got a call
from Longwood Nursing Home

01:08:39.786 --> 01:08:42.872
and they're cancelling due
to general illness of the audience.

01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:46.251
Food poisoning, apparently.

01:08:47.127 --> 01:08:48.462
We'll have to reschedule.

01:09:00.599 --> 01:09:01.975
"She's a bed-swerver,

01:09:02.059 --> 01:09:04.853
"even as bad as those
that give bold'st titles."

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:08.273
"Ay, and privy to this their late escape."

01:09:08.357 --> 01:09:11.026
"No, by my life, privy to none of this."

01:09:11.859 --> 01:09:12.861
What do you think?

01:09:12.944 --> 01:09:15.029
- Better. That was better.
- You like it?

01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:27.376
We're the theater company
here for the play.

01:09:27.459 --> 01:09:29.545
- That way.
- Thank you.

01:09:31.255 --> 01:09:32.506
"I know it too well.

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:34.758
"Give me the boy.

01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:36.301
"I'm glad you did not nurse him,

01:09:36.385 --> 01:09:38.220
"though he does bear some signs of me."

01:09:38.303 --> 01:09:40.305
"What is this? Sport?"

01:09:40.389 --> 01:09:42.890
"Bear the boy hence.
He shall not come about her.

01:09:42.975 --> 01:09:46.937
"Away with him and let her sport
herself with that she's big with,

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:50.691
"for 'tis Polixenes

01:09:54.319 --> 01:09:57.030
"She is an adulteress!"

01:09:57.656 --> 01:10:00.200
She's not an adulteress! She's a spy!

01:10:00.993 --> 01:10:02.411
Don't think you can fool me.

01:10:02.494 --> 01:10:05.205
- Can't you ever shut up, madam?
- I'm so sorry.

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:09.084
- It's important.
- You think everybody's a spy.

01:10:09.168 --> 01:10:11.837
And stop wearing that tacky green shirt!

01:10:12.296 --> 01:10:13.380
Out!

01:10:15.507 --> 01:10:18.135
Donahue. <i>Scarborough Fair.</i>

01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:21.054
Now, please.

01:10:22.723 --> 01:10:23.932
Is he a part of the show?

01:10:24.558 --> 01:10:25.976
Well, he is now.

01:10:30.898 --> 01:10:31.982
Um...

01:10:32.065 --> 01:10:34.818
"For calumny will sear virtue itself,

01:10:34.902 --> 01:10:36.528
"that mercy does...

01:10:37.196 --> 01:10:40.490

01:14:30.888 --> 01:14:32.347
Claude.

01:14:33.307 --> 01:14:37.102
I've missed you so much.

01:14:40.898 --> 01:14:42.316
Oh, my Claude.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:48.238
You are so beautiful.

01:15:00.959 --> 01:15:02.044
Hmm.

01:15:24.191 --> 01:15:25.526
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Whoa!

01:15:25.609 --> 01:15:27.152
Oh, my God!

01:15:32.157 --> 01:15:34.368
- Where is she?
- Who?

01:15:39.706 --> 01:15:43.168
<i>My sweet embraceable you</i>

01:15:44.086 --> 01:15:45.712
<i>Embrace me</i>

01:15:45.796 --> 01:15:50.717
<i>You irreplaceable you</i>

01:15:50.801 --> 01:15:53.303
<i>Just one look at you</i>

01:15:53.387 --> 01:15:58.100
<i>My heart grew tipsy in me</i>

01:15:58.183 --> 01:16:00.519
<i>You and you alone</i>

01:16:00.602 --> 01:16:05.941
<i>Bring out the gypsy in me</i>

01:16:06.024 --> 01:16:12.030
<i>I love all the many charms about you</i>

01:16:13.073 --> 01:16:19.079
<i>Above all I want my arms about you</i>

01:16:20.455 --> 01:16:24.501
<i>Don't be a naughty baby</i>

01:16:24.626 --> 01:16:30.674
<i>Come to pappa, come to pappa do</i>

01:16:30.757 --> 01:16:36.722
<i>My sweet embraceable you</i>

01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:43.145
Mr. Berenson? Mrs. Blanche?

01:16:43.228 --> 01:16:44.479
Lily?

01:17:13.634 --> 01:17:15.093
Hi, baby.

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:23.018
The new tests show
no sign of Alzheimer's or dementia.

01:17:23.101 --> 01:17:26.939
In fact, your mental faculties
are impeccable.

01:17:29.066 --> 01:17:31.193
I'm well. I'm not ill.

01:17:31.276 --> 01:17:32.778
Does that make you happy?

01:17:33.654 --> 01:17:35.072
Yeah, I'm happy.

01:17:35.906 --> 01:17:41.161
So am I, Claude,
but Alzheimer's is nothing to joke about.

01:17:41.245 --> 01:17:45.165
When did you hear me
joke about Alzheimer's? Never.

01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:49.253
I just said
I didn't wanna wear a diaper. I hate it.

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:53.507
Now, I don't know what plans
you and your family have,

01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:58.428
but I'm afraid you won't be permitted
to stay here any longer.

01:17:58.846 --> 01:18:02.432
Well, but what about Lillian?
I love her and she loves me.

01:18:02.516 --> 01:18:05.102
She has a loving husband,

01:18:05.185 --> 01:18:07.938
who probably won't like
romantic overtures.

01:18:08.397 --> 01:18:12.317
But we would be playing with fire
if we let you stay.

01:18:12.776 --> 01:18:15.279
I hope you understand.

01:18:15.821 --> 01:18:17.573
That's all I have to say.

01:18:18.448 --> 01:18:21.326
Thanks, Ms. Marcos, for everything.

01:18:26.999 --> 01:18:28.250
I don't want you to go.

01:18:29.334 --> 01:18:30.961
Thank you.

01:18:31.044 --> 01:18:34.965
And you and I both know
you're a lot smarter than people think.

01:18:35.048 --> 01:18:36.425
You know.

01:18:40.345 --> 01:18:41.847
Come on.

01:18:43.182 --> 01:18:44.224
Oh.

01:18:45.934 --> 01:18:48.437
My most fond memory here

01:18:48.979 --> 01:18:52.441
is the fact that you could
flat-out play the guitar.

01:19:07.206 --> 01:19:09.166
Know how special you are.

01:19:10.959 --> 01:19:12.169
Okay?

01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:26.016
- Well, sir.
- Sir.

01:19:26.099 --> 01:19:27.935
My guardian angel.

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.693
Where are you going?

01:19:38.612 --> 01:19:42.241
My daughter and my granddaughter

01:19:43.408 --> 01:19:45.285
need to spend time with me.

01:19:47.412 --> 01:19:48.956
You have a daughter?

01:20:02.344 --> 01:20:03.637
That's good.

01:20:25.701 --> 01:20:27.369
I will love you

01:20:29.663 --> 01:20:32.124
as long as I live.

01:20:41.049 --> 01:20:44.469
"Doubt thou the stars are fire."

01:20:50.642 --> 01:20:52.728
"Doubt that

01:20:53.687 --> 01:20:55.772
"the sun does move."

01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:07.618
Mom's not gonna say it, so...

01:21:07.701 --> 01:21:10.495
I was wondering
if we could stay here for a while.

01:21:10.579 --> 01:21:12.664
- Please.
- Book it.

01:21:12.748 --> 01:21:14.082
- Book it?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:21:14.166 --> 01:21:18.545
- I'll talk to your receptionist.
- Any day you want. 24/7, 365.

01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:21.298
Whatever it is.
I got the spare bedroom, two beds.

01:21:21.423 --> 01:21:24.635
They're all made up and they're
just waiting for a mom and daughter!

01:21:24.718 --> 01:21:25.761
How about that?

01:21:25.844 --> 01:21:27.429
Good. You said you were gonna cook?

01:21:27.513 --> 01:21:28.555
Uh...

01:21:28.639 --> 01:21:30.724
- I love this hotel!
- It's on you, Grandpa.

01:21:30.807 --> 01:21:32.142
This is the best hotel ever.

01:21:32.226 --> 01:21:35.062
You mean I have to cook all the meals?

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:40.526
I almost lost her once.

01:21:40.609 --> 01:21:43.529
Did everything I could to make her stay.

01:21:45.405 --> 01:21:47.324
You got the best out of me.

01:21:48.325 --> 01:21:50.577
I was surprised that she did stay.

01:21:51.453 --> 01:21:52.746
But this time,

01:21:55.332 --> 01:21:57.084
there's nothing I can do.

01:21:57.835 --> 01:22:01.129
This time, I just couldn't stand aside.

01:22:02.005 --> 01:22:03.131
I know.

01:22:04.132 --> 01:22:05.634
And I'm grateful to you

01:22:05.717 --> 01:22:09.012
for brightening up her days.

01:22:10.138 --> 01:22:13.225
This time and back then.

01:22:18.230 --> 01:22:20.983
You can come and visit her
any time you want.

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.778
What you just did for me

01:22:25.445 --> 01:22:29.658
is the nicest thing
anyone will ever do for me in my life.

01:22:30.576 --> 01:22:31.952
I wanna thank you.

01:22:32.828 --> 01:22:35.289
Thank you so much.
Okay, who have we got next?

01:22:35.372 --> 01:22:37.791
Daniel. Danny. Okay.

01:22:38.667 --> 01:22:39.960
You ready, Danny?

01:22:40.794 --> 01:22:42.296
You're not nervous?

01:22:42.963 --> 01:22:45.883
Too bad my grandpa's girlfriend
isn't here to feed me lines.

01:22:47.217 --> 01:22:48.594
You don't need her.

01:22:49.803 --> 01:22:50.971
You're a natural.

01:22:51.638 --> 01:22:54.224
I wish I could have seen her
on stage in her heyday.

01:22:54.308 --> 01:22:55.601
She was beautiful.

01:22:58.604 --> 01:23:00.522
- Wanna read lines?
- Yeah.

01:23:03.525 --> 01:23:06.111
"Doubt thou the stars are fire,

01:23:06.195 --> 01:23:08.572
"doubt that the sun doth move,

01:23:08.655 --> 01:23:14.244
"doubt truth to be a liar,
but never doubt I love."

01:23:34.014 --> 01:23:37.267
- Do you want to read lines again?
- Yeah.

01:23:50.572 --> 01:23:51.782
Oh, my God.

01:23:52.449 --> 01:23:54.451
Look at you. You look fabulous.

01:23:54.535 --> 01:23:55.661
As do you.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:59.456
- Fosamax?
- Nope!

01:24:00.082 --> 01:24:02.251
- Diclofenac?
- Nope!

01:24:07.047 --> 01:24:09.800
- You dirty bastard.
- Hmm.

01:24:11.468 --> 01:24:14.137
Jesus! Let's have a toast to that.

01:24:14.221 --> 01:24:16.598
- Oh, here. Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

01:24:16.682 --> 01:24:18.350
- Coffee.
- Some coffee.

01:24:20.185 --> 01:24:21.270
Mmm.

01:24:22.312 --> 01:24:23.522
So, how are you doing?

01:24:24.398 --> 01:24:25.816
Sliding by.

01:24:25.899 --> 01:24:29.611
Sliding? You, sliding is good.

01:24:29.695 --> 01:24:32.656
- Sliding works.
- Hm-hm. Seems to.

01:24:32.739 --> 01:24:34.908
- Eighty years.
- Uh-huh.

01:24:34.992 --> 01:24:37.411
- Still sliding.
- Yeah.

01:24:40.907 --> 01:24:45.907
