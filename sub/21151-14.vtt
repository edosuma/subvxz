00:01.620 --> 00:06.770
ANNOUNCER: Previously
on "Big Brother,"

00:06.770 --> 00:09.050
after the Marine
successfully completed

00:09.050 --> 00:12.130
operation Battle Back--

00:12.130 --> 00:13.850
JULIE CHEN:
Congratulations, Cody.

00:13.850 --> 00:17.260
You have won the
Battle Back Showdown,

00:17.260 --> 00:20.110
and you are back in the game.

00:20.110 --> 00:22.690
ANNOUNCER: --Jessica briefed
him on her good news.

00:25.710 --> 00:29.580
So, if you and I get put on the
block in the next three weeks,

00:29.580 --> 00:31.330
I can literally
halt the eviction.

00:31.330 --> 00:32.630
What?

00:32.630 --> 00:35.660
ANNOUNCER: With everyone
wanting Cody back out the door--

00:35.660 --> 00:36.560
Remember Cody?

00:36.560 --> 00:38.110
Public enemy number one?

00:38.110 --> 00:40.310
He's still public
enemy number one.

00:40.310 --> 00:42.380
ANNOUNCER: --it was 10
versus 2 at the Head

00:42.380 --> 00:46.190
of Household competition.

00:46.190 --> 00:49.560
So, Josh tried to psych
out Jess and Cody.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.910
You look
like a pack of meatballs.

00:51.910 --> 00:54.330
You're about to drop it, baby.

00:56.600 --> 01:00.020
ANNOUNCER: But it wasn't
enough to halt the hottie.

01:00.020 --> 01:01.910
Congratulations, Jessica.

01:01.910 --> 01:04.430
You are the new
Head of Household.

01:04.430 --> 01:06.800
ANNOUNCER: With Josh
the obvious target--

01:06.800 --> 01:08.190
She doesn't have time for you.

01:08.190 --> 01:09.990
She doesn't want to talk?

01:09.990 --> 01:11.450
No.

01:11.450 --> 01:12.710
Neither one of us want to talk.

01:12.710 --> 01:15.990
ANNOUNCER: --the Marines' former
friends started kissing butt.

01:15.990 --> 01:18.290
I want to know moving forward
that I have your support.

01:18.290 --> 01:19.260
Yeah.

01:19.260 --> 01:21.020
Anything I can do
in my power to make

01:21.020 --> 01:25.460
sure that the original
plan sticks, I'm all in.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.110
Because I do love you guys.

01:27.110 --> 01:30.320
ANNOUNCER: And the two alphas
appeared to make a truce.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.540
The craziest thing
is, if we work together,

01:32.540 --> 01:34.810
we could go extremely far.
- Absolutely.

01:34.810 --> 01:35.900
And you recognize that.

01:35.900 --> 01:36.920
I do recognize that.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.590
ANNOUNCER: But it was
all just a facade.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.450
I'm sure me and Paul could
run the show all the way

01:41.450 --> 01:42.860
to the end, but I
don't really trust

01:42.860 --> 01:44.240
anything he's saying anyway.

01:44.240 --> 01:46.800
Fool me once, shame on you.

01:46.800 --> 01:51.210
Fool me twice, shame on me.

01:51.210 --> 01:52.910
ANNOUNCER: Needing
another nominee,

01:52.910 --> 01:55.070
Jess worried about the votes.

01:55.070 --> 01:58.580
I want to cut off the
head, but the safe move

01:58.580 --> 02:01.850
is to cut off the ass.
- Agreed.

02:01.850 --> 02:04.880
We need numbers on the
other side of the house.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.040
Taking a shot at
Paul is really risky.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.050
We are still a
minority in the house.

02:09.050 --> 02:10.410
We don't have numbers.

02:10.410 --> 02:12.810
So we have to be careful
about how we move forward.

02:12.810 --> 02:14.150
ANNOUNCER: So they
considered someone

02:14.150 --> 02:16.040
who wouldn't rock the boat.

02:16.040 --> 02:20.330
You could do the
Josh, Ramses thing.

02:20.330 --> 02:24.290
Ramses doesn't really have
many people left in this house.

02:24.290 --> 02:27.750
He's not really a threat
to my game or Jess's game.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.740
ANNOUNCER: At the
nomination ceremony--

02:29.740 --> 02:32.410
I nominated you,
Ramses, and you, Josh.

02:32.410 --> 02:35.580
ANNOUNCER: --Jess put up
a pawn and a meatball.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.230
Ramses, you're just a pawn.

02:37.230 --> 02:40.960
Josh, I think you have played a
very dirty and disgusting game

02:40.960 --> 02:42.000
in this house.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.550
And in my opinion, you don't
even deserve to be here.

02:44.550 --> 02:47.170
And I can't imagine someone
better to take you out than me.

02:47.170 --> 02:49.300
ANNOUNCER: Tonight,
the Power of Veto

02:49.300 --> 02:51.640
could blow up someone's game.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.830
Will it be used to
save Ramses or Josh?

02:54.830 --> 02:58.450
Plus, is another
blindside brewing?

02:58.450 --> 03:02.530
Find out right now
on "Big Brother."

03:02.530 --> 03:04.080
You're mushing
your organs together.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.330
I know.
It can hurt sometimes, but--

03:47.590 --> 03:50.130
This nomination
ceremony is adjourned.

03:56.980 --> 03:58.930
I'm going after some
floaters this week

03:58.930 --> 04:02.170
because I need to rebuild
some alliances that Cody

04:02.170 --> 04:05.290
and I have kind of ruined.

04:05.290 --> 04:08.080
So I have nominated
Ramses and Josh.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.990
Josh is definitely my target.

04:09.990 --> 04:11.620
He has made it very
clear that if he

04:11.620 --> 04:13.210
was to win any
power in this house

04:13.210 --> 04:14.920
that he would be
coming after me.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.720
Ramses is a pawn
in this scenario.

04:16.720 --> 04:17.420
Aw!

04:20.160 --> 04:21.570
You're squeezing
the hell out of me.

04:21.570 --> 04:22.270
Damn.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.180
I'm feeling worried
because obviously I don't

04:25.180 --> 04:26.580
want to go up on the block.

04:26.580 --> 04:29.800
But at least I do know that
Josh is going to be next to me.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.070
And he is a much bigger
target in the house than me.

04:33.070 --> 04:34.030
Damn, kid.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.920
For somebody to say
that I didn't deserve

04:44.920 --> 04:47.350
this opportunity sucks.

04:47.350 --> 04:50.960
I think Jess got caught in the
middle between me and Cody.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.560
But it's been a roller
coaster from the moment

04:53.560 --> 04:55.170
I jumped in here.

04:55.170 --> 04:55.870
And I don't--

04:55.870 --> 04:57.550
I didn't expect it
to be easy, but I'm

04:57.550 --> 04:58.450
not going out this week.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.810
Hey.
I know.

05:07.810 --> 05:09.310
Listen.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.110
I know.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.520
Come here.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.930
You just need to breathe, OK?

05:32.530 --> 05:34.860
God.

05:34.860 --> 05:36.360
I know.
I know.

05:39.460 --> 05:40.720
Feel what you're feeling.

05:40.720 --> 05:43.410
Allow yourself to feel it, OK?

05:43.410 --> 05:44.920
Because if not, you know--

05:44.920 --> 05:46.180
don't boil it up.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.130
Don't-- allow it.

05:49.130 --> 05:54.240
And then be cool this week, OK?

05:54.240 --> 05:57.460
There is a veto, all right?

05:57.460 --> 06:02.060
There is still an
opportunity, OK?

06:02.060 --> 06:03.490
I'm winning this veto.

06:03.490 --> 06:05.570
No doubt about it.

06:05.570 --> 06:07.210
No and, if, or buts, nothing.

06:07.210 --> 06:09.310
I'm winning the veto.

06:09.310 --> 06:11.290
And then as soon as I get
that veto around my neck,

06:11.290 --> 06:12.430
oh, I'm raising hell.

06:12.430 --> 06:13.970
I'll be fine.

06:13.970 --> 06:15.680
I just have to let it out.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.780
I want to know
that I'm not going

06:22.780 --> 06:24.580
to be surprised this week.

06:24.580 --> 06:28.100
Is Josh going home?

06:28.100 --> 06:29.610
Yeah.

06:29.610 --> 06:32.490
Putting up Josh is a no-brainer
because his game has never

06:32.490 --> 06:34.590
been truthful, and it's insane.

06:34.590 --> 06:37.980
He's a firecracker, and no
one's going to miss him.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.290
OK.

06:39.290 --> 06:40.260
You can come in.

06:40.260 --> 06:40.960
Oh.

06:40.960 --> 06:41.980
No, come in.

06:41.980 --> 06:44.150
Come in.

06:44.150 --> 06:46.760
I'm not going to surprised
this week, right?

06:46.760 --> 06:47.460
With what?

06:47.460 --> 06:48.900
As far as votes go.

06:48.900 --> 06:53.830
Personally I would not ask
those questions this early.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.760
Just wait for veto.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.670
You don't know who the
veto winner is, you

06:57.670 --> 06:58.960
don't know what will happen.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.990
So you've got to give
it time before you--

07:02.990 --> 07:06.290
Paul loves to give unsolicited
advice because he's a vet.

07:06.290 --> 07:08.890
- Just tips.
- OK.

07:08.890 --> 07:12.050
I appreciate it, Paul, but
I've got this one handled.

07:12.050 --> 07:14.150
But I'm not trying
to tell you what to do.

07:20.070 --> 07:21.890
- Oops.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.780
I still can't believe
we have our room back.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.160
I loved the speech.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.350
Because it was, like, to
the point, but it was just--

07:48.350 --> 07:49.230
I mean, stab.

07:49.230 --> 07:50.140
A jab.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.820
You just stabbed
him in the heart.

07:53.820 --> 07:55.850
And I was like, yeah.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.950
Jessica impresses me every day.

07:57.950 --> 08:02.230
I thought I had to stand
up for Jess with Josh,

08:02.230 --> 08:04.940
but she's going to be
the one to crush him--

08:06.680 --> 08:07.970
--and kick him out the door.

08:07.970 --> 08:10.070
This chick, she's incredible.

08:10.070 --> 08:12.260
I don't know how I
struck gold like this.

08:12.260 --> 08:15.920
And I pulled Elena and Paul.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.510
I was like, are you
guys going to screw

08:18.510 --> 08:20.820
me on this vote come Thursday?

08:20.820 --> 08:23.310
And Paul is like, don't
even start asking people

08:23.310 --> 08:26.550
that until you have the veto in
your hands, because if he wins

08:26.550 --> 08:30.500
veto, then that's a
whole different story.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.290
So--
- OK, Paul.

08:32.290 --> 08:34.200
I know.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.190
Life advice from Paul.

08:39.590 --> 08:40.440
What are you thinking?

08:40.440 --> 08:41.760
Hm?

08:41.760 --> 08:42.560
What are you thinking?

08:46.040 --> 08:47.590
- I'll be right back.
- I know.

08:47.590 --> 08:49.610
But think of this.

08:49.610 --> 08:52.490
They're using Ramses as a pawn.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.310
In order to toss a
wrench in their plan,

08:55.310 --> 08:58.430
we need to keep Josh in here.

08:58.430 --> 08:59.700
Send Ramses out.

09:02.050 --> 09:03.200
No, no, no.
No, no.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.480
Don't do that.

09:05.480 --> 09:08.390
I honestly don't know what is
going through Jessica's head.

09:08.390 --> 09:10.990
She has all the power
of HOH to eliminate

09:10.990 --> 09:13.520
whoever she wants and put
two people on the block that

09:13.520 --> 09:14.900
actually matter.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.890
She picks Josh and Ramses.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.130
Dumb options.

09:18.130 --> 09:19.130
Sorry, Jessica.

09:19.130 --> 09:22.380
Now these nominations are
going to bite you in the ass.

09:22.380 --> 09:24.280
Here's the thing.

09:24.280 --> 09:29.510
That kid will never go
against you, me, her, him.

09:29.510 --> 09:33.890
So why should we get rid of him?
- Yeah.

09:33.890 --> 09:35.920
He will never ever do it.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.970
Ever, ever.

09:41.430 --> 09:43.240
Why would I want
to get rid of Josh?

09:43.240 --> 09:45.900
He's pretty much
my shield, my gun.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.300
The guy just does it all.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.770
Jessica, I know you want
Josh out of this house,

09:49.770 --> 09:51.870
but I have the numbers to
keep him here this week,

09:51.870 --> 09:54.190
and you bet your sweet
buns I'm going to.

09:54.190 --> 09:59.370
Then we still have Josh in the
house, who is an enemy to them.

09:59.370 --> 10:02.960
And if in some weird way he
wins, he takes that shot,

10:02.960 --> 10:05.160
our hands are clean.
Think about it.

10:17.460 --> 10:18.650
You all right, homey?
- Yeah.

10:22.820 --> 10:24.550
I think you'll
get past this week.

10:59.920 --> 11:00.850
Just relax.

11:00.850 --> 11:02.520
So Paul lets me know
that all I gotta do

11:02.520 --> 11:03.570
is lay low this week.

11:03.570 --> 11:05.190
I'm gonna put up an
act and let this people

11:05.190 --> 11:06.330
think that I'm miserable.

11:06.330 --> 11:08.180
But I'm gunning for
that veto, because I'm

11:08.180 --> 11:09.780
not leaving nothing to chance.

11:09.780 --> 11:12.370
And I want Jess to have
to choose somebody else

11:12.370 --> 11:13.170
and sweat a little.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.100
OK?

11:29.780 --> 11:33.520
I'm going to be a NASCAR
pit crew about this.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.110
Do you watch NASCAR?

11:36.110 --> 11:37.320
I love it.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.360
Have you followed lately?

11:38.360 --> 11:39.380
Like, the last few years?

11:39.380 --> 11:40.240
Mm-hmm.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.360
Do you remember that girl
that went into a pit crew?

11:43.360 --> 11:45.140
She a tire changer or--

11:45.140 --> 11:46.850
Yeah, she was a tire changer.

11:46.850 --> 11:48.620
Wow.

11:48.620 --> 11:52.660
She must be a beast, right?

11:52.660 --> 11:53.700
Is it somebody you know, or--

11:56.260 --> 11:59.160
was it you?

11:59.160 --> 12:00.090
Shut up.

12:00.090 --> 12:00.790
You're lying.

12:00.790 --> 12:02.130
I swear to god.

12:02.130 --> 12:04.680
Google it.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.030
For whose team?

12:06.030 --> 12:08.370
- Michael Waltrip.
- Holy--

12:08.370 --> 12:10.630
I will geek out on
this if you let me.

12:10.630 --> 12:15.880
So if I get too geeky,
just say pump, pump, pump.

12:15.880 --> 12:16.700
What?

12:16.700 --> 12:20.030
1.2 seconds is the average
speed for the tire changers.

12:20.030 --> 12:20.730
Right.

12:20.730 --> 12:24.080
And the fourth time I tried
it, I had it in 1.5 seconds.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.950
So they called me the next
week and asked me if I wanted

12:25.950 --> 12:27.990
to come train with their team.

12:27.990 --> 12:30.150
I made history by
being the first female

12:30.150 --> 12:33.180
on a pit crew in the Sprint
Cup Series in NASCAR.

12:33.180 --> 12:35.120
I didn't know that there
was no other females.

12:35.120 --> 12:35.820
I didn't know--

12:35.820 --> 12:37.200
I thought I was
just being recruited

12:37.200 --> 12:38.810
for my athletic abilities.
- Yeah.

12:38.810 --> 12:40.530
But it was more of an
accomplishment on how far

12:40.530 --> 12:43.860
I've come with my life, rather
than just being a female

12:43.860 --> 12:45.620
in a male-dominated sport.

12:45.620 --> 12:48.420
The precision is
outrageous, because you

12:48.420 --> 12:49.940
can't have it tilted at all.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.140
Well, that and the amount of
pressure on you to do well now,

12:52.140 --> 12:53.280
because the second you--

12:53.280 --> 12:55.020
up, they're going to say,
well, that's what happens

12:55.020 --> 12:56.940
when you put a woman in there.

12:56.940 --> 12:59.250
You have grease in your ears.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.160
The fumes give you a headache.
- Yeah.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.550
But by the end
of the day, I would

13:02.550 --> 13:04.250
be kind of sick to my stomach.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.880
But it's super-- it was fun.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.540
That's incredible.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.480
I'm making an effort to talk
to other HouseGuests more,

13:12.480 --> 13:14.710
seem more interested in
what they're telling me.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.170
No--

13:16.170 --> 13:17.840
While I think it's really
cool that Christmas was

13:17.840 --> 13:19.770
in a NASCAR pit
crew, I am playing up

13:19.770 --> 13:21.390
my expressions a
little bit to increase

13:21.390 --> 13:24.860
my social game with her.

13:24.860 --> 13:26.350
If you want tickets.

13:32.330 --> 13:33.470
Hey, everyone.

13:33.470 --> 13:35.970
It's time to take place
in the veto competition!

13:35.970 --> 13:37.960
- Yay!
- Woo!

13:43.960 --> 13:45.760
Only six people
will participate

13:45.760 --> 13:47.200
in the veto competition.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.150
The Head of Household,
the two nominees,

13:49.150 --> 13:51.970
and three other players
selected by random draw.

13:51.970 --> 13:53.660
Will the nominees
please join me up here?

13:56.490 --> 13:57.840
I want Josh to go
home this week,

13:57.840 --> 14:00.480
so I would love to see Cody's
name come out of that box.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.650
It gives Josh less of
a chance of winning.

14:02.650 --> 14:05.280
I, as Head of Household,
and the two nominees

14:05.280 --> 14:07.110
will each pull a
chip out of the box

14:07.110 --> 14:09.180
to determine the three
other players competing

14:09.180 --> 14:10.740
in the veto competition.

14:10.740 --> 14:12.690
As HOH, I will pick first.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.580
HouseGuest's choice.

14:19.580 --> 14:22.250
I pick Cody.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.000
Of course she picks me.

14:31.490 --> 14:32.700
I'm hoping I draw Paul.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.830
Because if he wins the veto,
I'm pretty sure that he'll

14:34.830 --> 14:35.730
pull me off the block.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.460
Jason.

14:42.420 --> 14:44.550
I'm just glad my
name got picked.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.310
I want the veto in my hands
because then I know for sure

14:47.310 --> 14:48.530
that nothing's going to change.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.260
Christmas!

15:00.170 --> 15:02.710
I get picked for the
veto competition again.

15:02.710 --> 15:06.680
However I'm just hoping this
time I actually get to play.

15:06.680 --> 15:07.860
Who knows what it's going to be?

15:07.860 --> 15:09.620
But I am in.

15:09.620 --> 15:10.940
"Big Brother" will
inform us when

15:10.940 --> 15:12.550
the competition is to begin.

15:12.550 --> 15:13.870
Good luck.

15:28.220 --> 15:28.920
Honestly.

15:28.920 --> 15:33.110
I'm good, as long
as he doesn't win.

15:33.110 --> 15:33.810
Right.

15:33.810 --> 15:34.980
Because if he
wins, then I feel

15:34.980 --> 15:38.040
like I'm in a tough position.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.420
This freaking sucks.

15:39.420 --> 15:42.870
All I know right now is that
I have to go for this veto,

15:42.870 --> 15:45.000
win it, and take
myself off the block.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.520
I feel for you.

15:46.520 --> 15:50.280
And I will do everything in
my power to win it and make

15:50.280 --> 15:52.010
sure that he goes home.

15:52.010 --> 15:52.980
You'll be fine.

15:52.980 --> 15:56.000
No matter what happens,
I will rally for you.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.310
- Thanks.
- I promise.

15:57.310 --> 15:58.830
Thank you.

15:58.830 --> 16:00.310
I appreciate you
talking to me, though.

16:00.310 --> 16:01.290
- Yeah.
- That's cool.

16:01.290 --> 16:02.480
Thanks.
- Yeah.

16:13.710 --> 16:15.830
Jess, Cody, and
Ramses cannot win.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.780
- OK.

16:19.780 --> 16:22.500
OK.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.480
I don't want to be moping
around and playing the role

16:24.480 --> 16:26.160
of "I'm going home this week."

16:26.160 --> 16:28.680
I want to win this
veto and run my mouth

16:28.680 --> 16:31.620
and have those meatballs go
crazy for a whole nother week.

16:35.390 --> 16:36.160
It's game on.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.080
My boy is bad ass.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.630
Because I put him to bed,
he goes right to sleep.

16:52.630 --> 16:53.650
And does he cry?

16:53.650 --> 16:54.430
No.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.040
I have a two-year-old son.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.160
His name's Gatlin Ike.

16:57.160 --> 17:01.120
He's my first-born
son and my only child.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.820
And my wife Holly, they're
by far the best part of me

17:03.820 --> 17:07.300
and the loves of my life.

17:07.300 --> 17:11.550
I hold him, and I
say, son, I love you.

17:11.550 --> 17:13.680
And your dad will see you
first thing in the morning.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.920
Now you sleep tight.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.790
And I kiss him,
and I put him down.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.090
That's what you
say every night?

17:19.090 --> 17:20.640
Yes, and he goes
right to sleep.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.650
I do miss him, because
he's such a great kid.

17:24.650 --> 17:29.620
He's a-- he's got
all the right stuff.

17:29.620 --> 17:34.460
Gatlin is the best thing that
I've personally ever done.

17:37.870 --> 17:39.640
- Yes.

17:39.640 --> 17:40.840
The kid's brilliant.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.930
That kid makes a peep,
though, I mean I'm right here.

17:47.830 --> 17:49.490
Jason, what are you doing?

17:49.490 --> 17:51.200
And then if he
keeps crying, I go in.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.170
He's showing us what he does.

17:53.170 --> 17:54.750
He thinks he's back
home right now.

17:58.980 --> 18:01.810
Oh, god.

18:01.810 --> 18:04.160
I mean, every day I think
about him wanting to know where

18:04.160 --> 18:08.080
his dad's at and why I'm not
feeding the bulls with him, why

18:08.080 --> 18:11.200
I'm not feeding the
dogs with him, why

18:11.200 --> 18:12.310
we're not riding the horses.

18:12.310 --> 18:17.320
He probably wonders why we're
not doing any cowboy stuff.

18:17.320 --> 18:18.900
I didn't even want
to talk about it.

18:26.650 --> 18:28.370
, what happened?
- Nothing.

18:28.370 --> 18:31.210
I was just putting my
belt right in here.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.690
Shut up.
You had a moment.

18:32.690 --> 18:33.950
- No, I didn't have a--
- Yes, you did.

18:33.950 --> 18:34.710
Look at me.

18:34.710 --> 18:35.440
No, get out of here.

18:35.440 --> 18:36.360
Look at me.

18:39.980 --> 18:40.810
Get back.

18:40.810 --> 18:43.820
You're a great dad.

18:43.820 --> 18:49.100
It keeps me, I guess,
focused because I

18:49.100 --> 18:51.140
would like to change--

18:51.140 --> 18:53.730
I would like to
change his stars.

18:53.730 --> 18:57.020
And I feel like
being here allows

18:57.020 --> 18:59.150
a better chance for that.

18:59.150 --> 19:01.520
I'm coming home, son.

19:01.520 --> 19:04.280
With 500,000 bucks.

19:04.280 --> 19:07.180
- You're the best dad.
- Thanks.

19:11.060 --> 19:11.900
I was putting my--

19:11.900 --> 19:12.830
I was gonna put my belt on.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.540
Hey, everybody, it's time
for the veto competition.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.280
Put on your gear.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.680
Meet me in the yard.

19:29.680 --> 19:33.420
It's about to get juicy.
Juicy.

19:41.730 --> 19:43.200
Woo!

19:44.670 --> 19:47.060
We walk into the
yard, and there

19:47.060 --> 19:49.250
are smoothie shops all over.

19:49.250 --> 19:52.040
And I obviously know
what this competition is.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.800
It's the explosion competition.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.130
Woo!

19:56.130 --> 19:58.150
And as a super-fan,
I'm geeked to play this.

19:58.150 --> 20:01.450
And Kevin is standing there
like a friggin' human grape.

20:01.450 --> 20:02.300
Like, what is this?

20:02.300 --> 20:04.210
Like, an underwear commercial?
What is this?

20:04.210 --> 20:05.760
Christine?
Vanessa?

20:05.760 --> 20:07.130
Bridget?
Are those the people who won it?

20:07.130 --> 20:08.340
Yeah.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.940
So cool!

20:10.940 --> 20:11.750
Juices.

20:11.750 --> 20:15.290
Walk up to the BB Juicy
Blast Smoothie and Juice Bar.

20:15.290 --> 20:18.740
Today you will strive to
create the perfect drinks.

20:18.740 --> 20:20.930
If you hope to become
Employee of the Month,

20:20.930 --> 20:23.270
you must know the ingredients
for each smoothie better

20:23.270 --> 20:24.920
than everyone else.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.510
In each round of
this competition,

20:26.510 --> 20:30.860
you will top off a drink by
adding its final ingredient.

20:30.860 --> 20:34.100
A monitor will list ingredients
that are in one drink.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.080
After seeing
several ingredients,

20:36.080 --> 20:38.870
you will be instructed to
retrieve a specific item

20:38.870 --> 20:40.700
to complete your drink.

20:40.700 --> 20:43.010
Once everyone has
selected an ingredient,

20:43.010 --> 20:46.490
I'll instruct you to pour this
ingredient into the drink cup.

20:46.490 --> 20:48.320
If you pour the
correct ingredients,

20:48.320 --> 20:50.760
you'll advance to
the next round.

20:50.760 --> 20:53.240
But if you pour the
incorrect ingredient,

20:53.240 --> 20:57.350
your chances of winning the
veto will blow up in your face,

20:57.350 --> 20:58.340
and you are out.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.730
The last player remaining
will earn Employee

21:00.730 --> 21:04.100
of the Month and power of veto.

21:04.100 --> 21:07.250
Who's ready to play
BB Juicy Blast?

21:11.900 --> 21:14.770
So, I need to win this veto
'cause I need to get myself off

21:14.770 --> 21:18.010
the block, 'cause I'm ready
to serve Jess and Cody some

21:18.010 --> 21:19.750
meatballs smoothies all week.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.630
Hey, Jess and Cody, you think
you like the taste of those,

21:22.630 --> 21:24.400
meatball?

21:24.400 --> 21:25.810
Josh is definitely
a bigger target,

21:25.810 --> 21:27.460
but you just never
know in this house.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.790
So I'm going to go full
force and win this veto.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.160
I need to keep the
house calm this week,

21:33.160 --> 21:34.800
and that means winning
the power of veto

21:34.800 --> 21:36.220
and keeping noms the same.

21:36.220 --> 21:38.890
I can't have Ramses or
Josh win it and pull

21:38.890 --> 21:40.400
themselves off the block.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.190
Round one, let's begin.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.650
Pour the middle item
of the sequence.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.990
So, this is right up
the rodeo clown's alley.

22:00.990 --> 22:01.690
I'm an auctioneer.

22:01.690 --> 22:03.940
I memorize things in
sequence for a living.

22:03.940 --> 22:07.210
I should have this baby
in the bag no problem.

22:10.800 --> 22:15.510
But I literally have no
idea what is in a smoothie.

22:15.510 --> 22:17.180
I don't even think I've
ever had a smoothie.

22:41.630 --> 22:43.310
My strategy in
this competition

22:43.310 --> 22:46.080
is just memorize the first
syllable of each word.

22:46.080 --> 22:51.080
Ginger, starfruit, spinach--
so gin, star, spin.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.490
My strategy in
this competition

22:52.490 --> 22:54.410
is to sing the
ingredients on the screen

22:54.410 --> 22:59.100
and make it repetitive so
it's just nailed into my head.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.680
Ginger, starfruit,
spinach, papaya, beet.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.780
Ginger starfruit,
spinach, papaya, beet.

23:02.780 --> 23:05.030
And now I have useless
ingredients stuck in my head

23:05.030 --> 23:06.440
until the end of time.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.490
Thank you, "Big Brother."

23:09.490 --> 23:12.190
Now it's time to pour your
ingredients into your drink.

23:19.910 --> 23:22.390
I am ready to beast
this competition.

23:22.390 --> 23:24.160
I want to show the house
that I'm not just--

23:32.290 --> 23:33.730
Aw!

23:33.730 --> 23:34.460
Oh my god.

23:37.380 --> 23:42.510
Jingle boom, jingle
boom, Christmas lost the veto.

23:42.510 --> 23:44.160
Looks like you're getting
a big sack of coal

23:44.160 --> 23:47.210
this year, because you
literally blew it, Christmas.

23:48.700 --> 23:51.510
The correct
answer was spinach.

23:51.510 --> 23:52.470
Damn it.

23:52.470 --> 23:53.940
I'm sorry, Christmas.

23:53.940 --> 23:55.700
You have been eliminated.

23:55.700 --> 23:56.930
It smells like bananas.

23:59.930 --> 24:01.640
It's now time for round two.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.100
Pour the item that
starts with the letter

24:10.100 --> 24:12.050
G that is not in the sequence.

24:19.150 --> 24:22.420
Oh my god, I am
struggling right now.

24:22.420 --> 24:25.900
I'm not sure whether it's
ginger or guava that is missing

24:25.900 --> 24:28.920
from this friggin' sequence.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.810
If I don't get
this answer right,

24:30.810 --> 24:33.580
I'm going to be blown
away and not in good way.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.400
It's extremely important
for me to win this veto.

24:39.400 --> 24:42.620
I know that I don't need my fate
in no one's hands but my own.

24:42.620 --> 24:44.410
So I want to pull
myself off the block

24:44.410 --> 24:46.090
in order to ensure
that I'm safe.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.040
With Christmas
eliminated, we have

25:01.040 --> 25:05.640
Jason, Cody, Jessica, Josh, and
Ramses left in the competition.

25:13.390 --> 25:16.240
Right now I'm holding up
ginger, but it could be guava.

25:16.240 --> 25:20.520
So I'm just going to choose
ginger and hope for the best.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.120
Oh, my god.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.100
Please.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.800
It's now time to pour your
ingredient into your drink.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.230
Go, Jason!

25:40.950 --> 25:41.650
Oh!

25:54.030 --> 25:56.890
Oh my god.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.280
The juice is loose.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.550
The correct answer was guava.

26:01.550 --> 26:02.370
I'm sorry.

26:02.370 --> 26:06.530
Ramsey, Josh, Jason
have been eliminated.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.660
How was that wrong?

26:11.660 --> 26:13.420
Apparently my memory sucks.

26:16.550 --> 26:17.500
God.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.580
Back to rodeo clowning.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.940
Guava?

26:23.940 --> 26:28.910
Literally Literally, the veto
just exploded out of my hands.

26:28.910 --> 26:30.270
I knew it was guava.

26:30.270 --> 26:31.630
Why did I pick ginger?

26:31.630 --> 26:33.320
Ramses, you idiot.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.750
You could have won
this power of veto,

26:34.750 --> 26:36.540
and you just screwed
yourself over.

26:39.320 --> 26:42.420
I knew it was guava.

26:42.420 --> 26:44.650
It completely sucks
to know that I lose

26:44.650 --> 26:47.300
from second-guessing myself.

26:47.300 --> 26:51.550
But more disappointing is
that I lose to Jess and Cody.

26:51.550 --> 26:52.840
I can't stand these people.

26:52.840 --> 26:56.140
They want me out so bad,
that me losing this comp,

26:56.140 --> 26:57.040
they're living for it.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.510
I knew it was guava.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.680
It's down to Jessica and
Cody for the power of veto.

27:09.680 --> 27:12.000
- Yes!
- Oh, god.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.930
This week couldn't
get any better.

27:16.910 --> 27:18.410
Josh is a dumb-dumb anyways.

27:18.410 --> 27:20.810
I didn't expect him to
win this competition.

27:20.810 --> 27:24.860
I'm not shocked that he went
out in the second round.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.870
I could feel in the
booth over from him

27:26.870 --> 27:29.000
that his spirits were
just absolutely crushed.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.290
And that satisfied me.

27:34.330 --> 27:35.860
How's it going over there, Cody?

27:35.860 --> 27:38.880
Jess, save your hair.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.280
That would imply
that I'm going to lose.

27:43.970 --> 27:45.820
Let's see the ingredients
for round three.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.810
Pour the item
that's in the sequence

27:55.810 --> 27:57.810
that was shown exactly twice.

28:02.610 --> 28:06.090
At this point, obviously me
and Jess have secured the veto.

28:06.090 --> 28:08.380
So the only thing that's
on my mind right now

28:08.380 --> 28:10.020
is saving Jess's hair.

28:14.670 --> 28:17.570
Because if this goo
gets all up in her hair,

28:17.570 --> 28:19.140
I'll never hear the end of it.

28:19.140 --> 28:21.320
So taking a smoothie
bomb to the face

28:21.320 --> 28:22.760
is the least I can do for Jess.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.460
Wow, a flavor explosion.

28:32.050 --> 28:35.900
The correct answer was dewberry.

28:35.900 --> 28:37.300
Congratulations, Jessica.

28:37.300 --> 28:40.480
You have won your
golden power of veto.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.630
I just won the power of
veto, and this is amazing.

28:53.630 --> 28:57.100
I can't even handle all
of this bling right now.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.960
I have all the
power in the house,

28:58.960 --> 29:01.850
and I couldn't ask
for anything better.

29:01.850 --> 29:04.740
So, next year I get to have
my face up on this wall?

29:04.740 --> 29:05.980
So cool.

29:05.980 --> 29:07.510
Oh my god.

29:07.510 --> 29:09.370
Oh my god!

29:09.370 --> 29:12.430
I'm a little relieved
that Josh didn't win it.

29:12.430 --> 29:15.730
But at the same time, in this
game, you really don't know.

29:15.730 --> 29:18.220
So I want to talk to
Jessica and make sure

29:18.220 --> 29:21.940
that I'm secure for this week.

29:21.940 --> 29:24.730
Now that Jessica won the
veto, I just need to make sure

29:24.730 --> 29:26.800
that she keeps
nominations the same,

29:26.800 --> 29:29.620
does not change or
take anybody on or off,

29:29.620 --> 29:33.040
and I can continue with my plan
to blindside Jessica and Cody

29:33.040 --> 29:34.480
and get Ramses
out of this house.

29:38.460 --> 29:40.020
I couldn't pull
myself off the block,

29:40.020 --> 29:41.400
and I didn't win the veto.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.230
I feel really disappointed.

29:43.230 --> 29:45.160
So now I just gotta
trust in the plan.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.110
But you never know.

29:46.110 --> 29:46.890
It's "Big Brother."

29:46.890 --> 29:47.730
Anything can happen.

29:58.510 --> 30:00.310
This sucks.

30:00.310 --> 30:02.750
As long as they don't
use the veto, you're safe.

30:02.750 --> 30:04.540
You don't think
she would, right?

30:04.540 --> 30:05.240
No.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.570
Which is why we need to be
like, even can drop that line,

30:08.570 --> 30:10.220
look Jess, I know the the
reason I'm going home.

30:10.220 --> 30:11.420
I just want to
keep things civil.

30:11.420 --> 30:13.600
Say that, OK?

30:13.600 --> 30:16.060
If Josh acts
like he is defeated

30:16.060 --> 30:19.130
and if no red flags are
raised for Jessica and Cody,

30:19.130 --> 30:22.570
then she would not be motivated
to use the power of veto,

30:22.570 --> 30:25.480
pull Ramses off, and potentially
switch it with somebody

30:25.480 --> 30:27.170
like, I don't know, me.

30:27.170 --> 30:29.250
- 100%.

30:29.250 --> 30:30.370
Stop asking me.

30:30.370 --> 30:34.510
So Josh, do what you do best,
and just go be emotional.

30:34.510 --> 30:36.620
Shut up and go cry.

30:36.620 --> 30:38.770
And then you'll thank me later.
- All right.

30:38.770 --> 30:41.130
So after she doesn't
use it, can I--

30:41.130 --> 30:43.270
- No.

30:43.270 --> 30:44.260
Yes.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.300
Yes.

30:45.300 --> 30:46.000
Go, dog.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.890
Jess, can I say
some things to you?

30:58.890 --> 31:00.690
Yeah, what's up?

31:00.690 --> 31:01.950
I know that I'm going home.

31:01.950 --> 31:03.330
Yeah.

31:03.330 --> 31:04.820
But I just want to
be civil and, like,

31:04.820 --> 31:06.740
enjoy the few days that I have.

31:06.740 --> 31:08.420
If that's what you
want, then great.

31:08.420 --> 31:10.670
Because I'm not starting
anything with you.

31:10.670 --> 31:14.400
But that's on you to uphold
that, you know what I mean?

31:14.400 --> 31:17.040
So, if that's what you want,
then I absolutely respect that.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.610
I would love for you to enjoy
your last few days here.

31:19.610 --> 31:20.870
This is a great
experience, and I

31:20.870 --> 31:22.070
don't want you to
go out feeling,

31:22.070 --> 31:24.120
like, anything negative.

31:24.120 --> 31:24.930
Yeah.

31:24.930 --> 31:26.120
I'm the target this week.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.100
Jess put you boy on
the block, and it

31:28.100 --> 31:30.650
sucks because I know
that in her plans,

31:30.650 --> 31:31.970
I'm walking out that door.

31:31.970 --> 31:34.800
If you can stand by
that, then I support it.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.780
Thank you.

31:36.780 --> 31:38.060
But psych.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.030
Little does she know
that her and her

31:40.030 --> 31:42.550
gang are getting blindsided.

31:42.550 --> 31:44.630
The house is keeping
me this week,

31:44.630 --> 31:47.250
and it's about to be a meatball
party, baby, because this house

31:47.250 --> 31:48.890
is about to go
mad this Thursday,

31:48.890 --> 31:50.270
when your boy stays in the crib.

31:57.380 --> 31:58.970
Right now, Cody and
Jessica are trying

31:58.970 --> 31:59.920
to even the playing field.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.120
They're trying to play a
different approach to the game,

32:02.120 --> 32:04.080
because they saw that
they were in the heat.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.240
Their whole power
trip didn't work once.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.340
They're making a mistake.

32:07.340 --> 32:08.440
If they were smart--

32:08.440 --> 32:09.140
I agree--

32:09.140 --> 32:13.400
--they would have put either
you, me, Alex, or Jason up.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.720
But they're stupid.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.820
So they misfired
and put two duds up.

32:16.820 --> 32:17.520
I agree.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.720
It was a stupid move.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.260
So their stupid
move is our benefit.

32:23.210 --> 32:23.900
Pop!

32:27.080 --> 32:28.940
You hear what I'm saying?

32:28.940 --> 32:32.930
We have his game on watch lock.

32:32.930 --> 32:34.550
We don't have that with Ramses.

32:34.550 --> 32:37.310
He is clearly a
number on their side,

32:37.310 --> 32:39.170
and he's going to go
wherever the wind blows.

32:39.170 --> 32:39.980
That's the player he is.

32:39.980 --> 32:43.060
Wherever the wind
blows, he's going.

32:43.060 --> 32:44.290
So, there's an
underground movement

32:44.290 --> 32:46.540
right now to evict Ramses.

32:46.540 --> 32:49.160
Keeping Josh is much
better for my game.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.190
He's going to be
loyal to me, and he's

32:51.190 --> 32:52.840
also a much bigger target.

32:52.840 --> 32:54.220
And he's the only
person who really gets

32:54.220 --> 32:55.270
under Jess and Cody's skin.

33:02.140 --> 33:06.220
I am down, like, four flat
tires, to vote out Ramses.

33:06.220 --> 33:07.780
I think he's a dangerous threat.

33:07.780 --> 33:10.570
So, if we succeed,
Jess and Cody are

33:10.570 --> 33:13.200
going to be completely shocked.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.260
It's going to be a big bomb--

33:15.260 --> 33:18.440
like, whew, boom!

33:18.440 --> 33:19.860
- Hey, boo.

33:23.940 --> 33:25.090
Dude, I'm scared.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.580
You're not on
people's radars, really.

33:27.580 --> 33:29.410
You haven't done anything
to piss anybody off,

33:29.410 --> 33:30.320
so why would anybody--

33:30.320 --> 33:32.070
I mean, I really
haven't done anything.

33:32.070 --> 33:34.410
Josh is clearly
the target, so why

33:34.410 --> 33:37.930
freak out and, like, potentially
make yourself stand out?

33:41.620 --> 33:44.790
I was just wondering,
like, are you

33:44.790 --> 33:47.970
thinking at all about using it?

33:47.970 --> 33:51.760
I would prefer to
leave noms the same.

33:51.760 --> 33:57.120
But if I talk to people
and have any kind of sense

33:57.120 --> 34:00.230
that you are in danger, I
will use it and pull you off.

34:00.230 --> 34:02.980
Wow.

34:02.980 --> 34:06.630
He's, like, obviously
more of a target.

34:06.630 --> 34:08.640
But, like, what scares
me is that obviously,

34:08.640 --> 34:11.600
like, I was on the block, and
there were two people that--

34:11.600 --> 34:15.590
I have no idea who they
are-- that voted for me.

34:15.590 --> 34:17.870
And if those people
happen to be people

34:17.870 --> 34:21.110
who have strong influence,
you know what I mean?

34:21.110 --> 34:21.890
Yeah.

34:21.890 --> 34:23.860
Let me talk to people today.

34:23.860 --> 34:28.640
I'll do a round, and before
veto ceremony happens.

34:28.640 --> 34:31.630
I'm honestly not trying to
put your game in jeopardy.

34:31.630 --> 34:33.210
And I appreciate
you trusting me.

34:33.210 --> 34:33.910
And I don't want--

34:33.910 --> 34:34.610
Yeah.

34:34.610 --> 34:36.960
No, honestly, the
thing is, I trust you.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.850
But like, I don't
trust the house.

34:38.850 --> 34:40.520
- It's everyone else.
- Because it's everyone else.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.200
I know.
You You know what I mean?

34:42.200 --> 34:45.050
If people want to
flip, like, then

34:45.050 --> 34:47.210
you guys are pretty
much screwed.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.670
Seeing the look of
worry on Ramses' face

34:49.670 --> 34:51.710
just breaks my heart.

34:51.710 --> 34:55.380
And the things that he's saying
make me a little bit paranoid.

34:55.380 --> 34:56.830
Thanks, man.
I appreciate it.

34:56.830 --> 34:58.100
You're welcome.

34:58.100 --> 35:01.110
I need to ensure that
Josh is the one going home.

35:01.110 --> 35:03.050
Otherwise, I want to
use the power of veto

35:03.050 --> 35:05.700
and pull Ramses off the block.

35:05.700 --> 35:08.920
Um, have you heard
anything about votes?

35:08.920 --> 35:09.780
No.

35:09.780 --> 35:14.960
As far as, like, is everyone
on board with Josh going out?

35:14.960 --> 35:19.860
I mean, it should unanimous.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.650
OK.

35:26.650 --> 35:29.050
Because Ramses
is, like, worried.

35:29.050 --> 35:32.520
And I want to make
sure that everyone

35:32.520 --> 35:36.140
is onboard with getting
out one singular target.

35:36.140 --> 35:37.610
- Yeah.

35:37.610 --> 35:38.580
Yeah.

35:38.580 --> 35:40.020
Yeah.

35:40.020 --> 35:42.090
It should be.
- OK.

35:42.090 --> 35:44.500
But I can't vouch
for everyone else.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.770
But--

35:45.770 --> 35:47.130
But you're going
to vote him out?

35:47.920 --> 35:48.620
OK.

35:51.350 --> 35:54.570
Raven gives me this
complete airhead response.

35:54.570 --> 35:58.210
She just was like, uh--
yeah.

35:58.210 --> 36:01.320
I mean, I think so.

36:01.320 --> 36:04.350
This is not making
my paranoia go away.

36:04.350 --> 36:05.160
God, woman.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.510
It's either a yes or a no.

36:29.710 --> 36:31.540
I really don't know
what to do right now.

36:31.540 --> 36:34.990
I'm getting really
paranoid about the vote.

36:34.990 --> 36:38.290
It would not surprise
me at all come Thursday

36:38.290 --> 36:39.250
that Ramses gets evicted.

36:41.920 --> 36:44.790
How could Ramses
not be fine, though?

36:44.790 --> 36:47.520
Because if I was on the
other side of the house,

36:47.520 --> 36:51.390
keeping Josh, he would
continue to terrorize us.

36:51.390 --> 36:53.230
Our game would be thrown off.

36:53.230 --> 36:54.900
Ramses they can't control.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.610
Josh they can.

36:56.610 --> 37:00.610
Keep everybody calm till votes
happen, send home Ramses.

37:00.610 --> 37:04.550
If that plan is already in
motion, all they need me to do

37:04.550 --> 37:06.250
is not use the veto.

37:06.250 --> 37:08.580
That is all they need me
to do, don't use the veto.

37:11.370 --> 37:14.850
I'm considering
maybe using the veto

37:14.850 --> 37:17.890
and pulling Ramses off
and putting Alex up.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.460
Putting Alex up there, though.
I don't know.

37:27.300 --> 37:29.880
I mean, I think you're
being a bit more

37:29.880 --> 37:31.950
paranoid than you need to be.

37:31.950 --> 37:35.090
Because I don't trust anyone.

37:35.090 --> 37:38.460
I've just got this feeling in
my gut that something is off.

37:38.460 --> 37:41.390
It's too good to be true.

37:41.390 --> 37:43.860
You won't hear a complaint
from me either way.

37:43.860 --> 37:45.630
I got your back.

37:45.630 --> 37:47.700
This is such a big decision.

37:47.700 --> 37:51.150
Either I'm being paranoid,
or I'm seeing something

37:51.150 --> 37:52.800
that's about to happen.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.550
Are we doing someone
else's dirty work?

37:55.550 --> 37:56.560
No way.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.830
I would rather
put up two people

37:58.830 --> 38:04.770
that I have no ties to at
all than risk losing Ramses.

38:12.270 --> 38:14.400
I don't want to
look back on this HOH

38:14.400 --> 38:16.290
and say that I wasted it.

38:16.290 --> 38:19.080
I don't want my
hindsight to be 20-20.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.610
I want to know
what's happening now.

38:21.610 --> 38:23.410
If they're going to
stab us in the back

38:23.410 --> 38:26.440
and send Ramses instead of
Josh, then it doesn't matter.

38:26.440 --> 38:27.520
We're the targets.

38:42.530 --> 38:44.780
I really don't want
to look back on my HOH

38:44.780 --> 38:48.800
and realize that I was just
used and blindsided once again.

38:48.800 --> 38:51.140
So I have to either
trust my housemates

38:51.140 --> 38:54.860
or take charge of the
situation and just put up Alex.

38:54.860 --> 38:56.520
I really don't want to
make the wrong decision.

39:38.910 --> 39:39.980
Hey, everyone.

39:39.980 --> 39:41.120
It's time for the veto meeting.

39:57.830 --> 39:59.390
This is the veto meeting.

39:59.390 --> 40:02.030
Ramses and Josh have been
nominated for eviction.

40:02.030 --> 40:05.770
But I have the power to veto
one of those nominations.

40:05.770 --> 40:07.390
I want to give both
of you the chance

40:07.390 --> 40:09.640
to tell me why you think I
should use the power of veto

40:09.640 --> 40:11.320
to save you.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.410
Ramses, you go first.

40:15.250 --> 40:16.730
Well, first of
all, congratulations

40:16.730 --> 40:18.710
on winning HOH and veto.

40:18.710 --> 40:21.750
That's pretty awesome.

40:21.750 --> 40:25.040
I just want to say, I obviously
want you to use the veto on me.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.350
I hope you've considered
all the options

40:27.350 --> 40:29.100
for what would be
best for your goal

40:29.100 --> 40:30.320
to be accomplished this week.

40:30.320 --> 40:34.100
And if me coming off the block
is the best option for you,

40:34.100 --> 40:35.000
please do so.

40:35.000 --> 40:35.940
I'd appreciate it.

40:35.940 --> 40:38.660
But if not, then
do what you feel.

40:38.660 --> 40:39.600
Thank you, Ramses.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.080
Josh, now it's
your turn to speak.

40:47.710 --> 40:49.380
Jess, I know that
I'm your target.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.220
And I'm most likely
walking out this door.

40:51.220 --> 40:53.290
But I want to say if I've
offended or disrespected

40:53.290 --> 40:55.480
anybody, I apologize.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.870
All you guys have become
part of mi familia,

40:57.870 --> 41:00.280
so I just want to walk out of
here with my head held high

41:00.280 --> 41:02.710
and enjoy my last few days.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.050
So, I respect your decision.

41:10.660 --> 41:11.360
I have decided--

41:15.130 --> 41:16.650
not to use the power of veto.

41:22.860 --> 41:24.660
This veto meeting is adjourned.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.320
I've decided not to
use the power of veto.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.800
And I'm putting my trust
once again in this house.

41:35.800 --> 41:38.290
Keeping nominations the
same angers less people

41:38.290 --> 41:40.540
in the house, and Cody and I
are trying to fly a little bit

41:40.540 --> 41:41.950
under the radar this week.

41:41.950 --> 41:45.190
I'm hoping that come Thursday
I don't get blindsided,

41:45.190 --> 41:46.490
and Josh walks out that door.

41:52.570 --> 41:55.650
That was the worst move ever!

41:55.650 --> 41:56.660
What are you thinking?

41:56.660 --> 41:57.840
What are you thinking?

41:57.840 --> 42:00.690
What are you all think--

42:00.690 --> 42:02.790
Josh, Ramses?

42:02.790 --> 42:05.940
Really, I get that you don't
want to stir the pot further,

42:05.940 --> 42:08.070
but at least make a solid move.

42:08.070 --> 42:09.090
Guess what, guys.

42:09.090 --> 42:12.820
Operation Keep Josh In,
Get Ramsey Out is go.

42:16.080 --> 42:20.010
Jess doesn't use the
veto on Ramses or myself.

42:20.010 --> 42:24.540
So you're getting
blindsided, baby.

42:24.540 --> 42:27.900
You bought into me moping
around, feeling lonely, being

42:27.900 --> 42:30.180
depressed, being defeated,
and you think that you're

42:30.180 --> 42:31.500
getting me out the door?

42:31.500 --> 42:35.670
Oh, baby girl, you're
highly confused, booboo.

42:35.670 --> 42:38.670
ANNOUNCER: Who will be evicted
from the "Big Brother" house?

42:38.670 --> 42:41.190
Ramses or Josh?

42:41.190 --> 42:46.310
Find out live, Thursday at 9:00,
8:00 central, on "Big Brother."
