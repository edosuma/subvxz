00:24.972 --> 00:29.363
You looked at Ray and said,
"l want him to be my boyfriend, -

00:29.532 --> 00:33.571
- but he's got to change. "
What are you talking about?

00:33.732 --> 00:37.645
One of the things
that initiated a misunderstanding -

00:37.812 --> 00:41.725
- was that one day,
l didn't want to have sex with him.

00:41.892 --> 00:46.170
So he starts talking about
calling somebody else to do it.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.803
Stop at $4,000!

00:54.972 --> 00:59.090
You'd been drinking, and you thought
you were making love to me.

01:03.372 --> 01:07.001
This differs from a normal massage.

01:14.772 --> 01:17.889
- Jamie, l ...
- No!

01:20.612 --> 01:25.481
This television funny-man
killed his brother in cold blood.

01:25.652 --> 01:29.247
My guests have crushes
on food service workers.

01:29.412 --> 01:33.530
Mr. Davis, do you take
cream and sugar in your eye?

01:40.852 --> 01:43.730
Do you want to tell them something?

01:43.892 --> 01:47.487
l'm really a man.

01:56.292 --> 02:00.444
Where's the cable guy?

02:10.051 --> 02:12.850
Rick Legatos, please.

02:16.612 --> 02:21.163
- Hey Rick, phone.
- How's the move going?

02:21.332 --> 02:27.009
The cable guy is missing in action.
l hope he gets here before l die.

02:27.172 --> 02:32.007
- You haven't called Robin?
- No. l'm giving her her space.

02:32.172 --> 02:36.882
- l can't believe she's doing this.
- You shouldn't have proposed.

02:37.052 --> 02:41.011
All she had to do was say no.
She didn't have to kick me out.

02:41.172 --> 02:45.290
- Let's go!
- Just give me a minute!

02:45.452 --> 02:48.489
Listen, a piece of advice ...

02:48.652 --> 02:54.284
Slip the cable guy $50, he'll give
you all the movie channels for free.

02:54.452 --> 02:59.287
l'm not good at that stuff.
What if he says no?

02:59.452 --> 03:02.364
None of them say no.

03:02.532 --> 03:06.411
- l've got to go. Talk to you later.
- All right.

03:10.132 --> 03:15.604
Hi, this is Robin Harris.
Steven doesn't live here anymore ...

03:36.292 --> 03:40.729
- Cable guy!
- Oh, great!

03:41.972 --> 03:46.090
- Cable guy!
- Don't leave!

03:49.572 --> 03:52.644
- Wait!
- Cable guy!

03:52.812 --> 03:56.930
- l'm coming!
- Cable guy!

03:59.652 --> 04:01.332
Cable guy!

04:01.332 --> 04:02.242
Cable guy!

04:05.692 --> 04:09.651
Wait! Come back.

04:11.092 --> 04:15.643
- Look who decided to show.
- You should have come hours ago.

04:15.812 --> 04:20.522
Should l?
So, l'm the tardy one?

04:20.692 --> 04:25.049
Yeah. l was going to the
bed-and-bath place. Now it's closed.

04:25.212 --> 04:29.683
Maybe l shouldn't have come at all.
Jerk off!

04:31.092 --> 04:34.801
l'm just joking with you.

04:37.372 --> 04:42.969
The old McNair place! Never thought
they'd get the floors clean ...

04:43.132 --> 04:48.445
- What happened?
- They had a lot of cats.

04:48.612 --> 04:52.525
- Please mail this in when l'm done.
- Does it go to your boss?

04:52.692 --> 04:57.527
No, it goes to me.
l'm kind of a perfectioniss ...

04:57.692 --> 05:00.809
Perfectioniss ... t.

05:02.772 --> 05:05.650
Let's take a look.

05:10.012 --> 05:13.243
This could be a cool pad.

05:15.172 --> 05:18.289
Come on, baby.

05:18.452 --> 05:23.924
Come on, baby.
Talk to me.

05:24.092 --> 05:28.768
Tell me where you like it.

05:34.252 --> 05:38.291
Hello, Mama.

05:39.372 --> 05:44.730
ls this what you want?
ls this where you need it?

05:50.092 --> 05:53.050
How about this?

06:00.532 --> 06:03.729
That's your sweet spot, right there.

06:08.172 --> 06:10.811
Your lady kicked you out.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.608
What?

06:14.772 --> 06:21.530
l noticed you were previously wired
at 1 2681 l2 Chestnut.

06:21.692 --> 06:27.244
Last week, the billing
was transferred to one Robin Harris.

06:27.412 --> 06:32.247
- Smells like heartbreak to me.
- l don't want to discuss that.

06:32.412 --> 06:37.122
- Just install my cable, please.
- Suit yourself.

06:37.292 --> 06:40.489
No sweat off my sack.

06:40.652 --> 06:44.281
You might want to
put on a bathing suit.

06:44.452 --> 06:48.764
You'll be channel surfing
in no time.

07:02.892 --> 07:07.283
So ends day 54 of the trial
of former child star, Sam Sweet, -

07:07.452 --> 07:11.491
- who has been accused of shooting
his brother Stan in cold blood.

07:11.652 --> 07:17.602
The twins were stars of
the hit sitcom, "Double Trouble".

07:17.772 --> 07:21.367
- Who broke this?
- He did it!

07:21.532 --> 07:27.004
Life wasn't sweet
after their programme was cancelled.

07:27.172 --> 07:30.164
Sam turned to petty larceny, -

07:30.332 --> 07:35.531
- while his brother fell in with
the cult "Brotherhood of Friends".

07:38.492 --> 07:41.928
l hope they fry this bastard.

07:48.812 --> 07:52.361
What happened?

07:52.532 --> 07:57.526
Your furniture and appliances were
causing problems with the reception.

07:58.492 --> 08:04.124
- l moved a few things, okay?
- Yeah, l guess.

08:04.292 --> 08:08.205
l just have some paperwork
for you to fill out.

08:08.372 --> 08:14.481
lt's a drag. You just get to know
somebody and then the job is done.

08:14.652 --> 08:18.042
Sign here.

08:27.612 --> 08:31.525
l feel good about this.

08:36.131 --> 08:38.885
Hey, wait!

08:39.052 --> 08:44.809
l have this friend,
and he gave his cable guy $50 ...

08:44.972 --> 08:49.887
He got all the movie channels
for free. Did you ever hear of that?

08:57.572 --> 09:02.885
- You mean illegal cable?
- Yeah ...

09:03.052 --> 09:06.567
- Who told you that?
- Forget it.

09:06.732 --> 09:08.927
You're offering me a bribe.

09:09.092 --> 09:14.724
That's illegal. You could be fined
up to $5,000 or go to jail.

09:14.892 --> 09:18.601
No, l was just making conversation.
Forget it.

09:22.652 --> 09:26.565
l'm just jerking your chain.

09:28.092 --> 09:35.442
You are too easy. Wake up.
Smell the smelling salt.

09:35.612 --> 09:37.887
l'll juice you up.

09:38.692 --> 09:43.641
- One guy doing another guy a solid.
- That is so nice.

09:43.812 --> 09:51.162
Well, you're a nice guy.
Many customers treat me like snot.

09:51.332 --> 09:55.245
Here's my personal pager number.

09:55.412 --> 10:01.885
- The company puts you on hold.
- Thanks. You'll get good marks.

10:02.052 --> 10:06.648
Maybe l'll show you the satellite,
how this whole thing works.

10:06.812 --> 10:11.169
- Sure, we should do that one day.
- How about tomorrow?

10:11.332 --> 10:17.851
- Tomorrow's no good.
- You'll be stewing about your ex?

10:19.332 --> 10:22.927
No.

10:23.092 --> 10:29.964
- l crossed the line. Sorry.
- You didn't cross the line.

10:30.132 --> 10:34.011
Cool! Pick you up at six-thirty.

10:36.372 --> 10:41.810
There are 2 4 classrooms.
Each can be converted into a home.

10:41.972 --> 10:48.127
There's a swimming pool,
tennis courts, a gym and a stage, -

10:48.292 --> 10:52.001
- if the residents decide
they want to perform ''Oklahoma''.

10:52.172 --> 10:57.724
- Oklahoma!
- lt's available in foreclosure.

10:57.892 --> 11:01.282
With a cash bid,
we can steal this thing.

11:12.012 --> 11:15.527
Tough room, but you got them.

11:15.692 --> 11:19.890
Are you having
a little domestic discord?

11:20.052 --> 11:25.080
Robin and l are having difficulties.
l think it's only temporary.

11:25.252 --> 11:31.248
lf you screw this project up,
it's not going to be my ass.

11:31.412 --> 11:34.449
- Do you know what l mean?
- l'm on it.

11:34.612 --> 11:38.605
l'm more patient. l'm more loving.
They tell me this.

11:38.772 --> 11:43.288
There's something in everyone's life
they could improve.

11:43.452 --> 11:49.641
lf they're doing well financially,
maybe their relationships suffer ...

11:49.812 --> 11:56.411
Call now, and you'll be rushed
the "Personal Power Success System. "

11:59.332 --> 12:03.120
Steven!

12:03.292 --> 12:06.489
Stevie, time to leavie!

12:08.612 --> 12:14.847
Come on down!
Are you waiting for an invitation?

12:15.012 --> 12:19.210
lt's the fun bus. Come on!

12:22.332 --> 12:25.324
- How's it going?
- Hey, buddy!

12:26.252 --> 12:29.244
l've had a few drinks,
so buckle up.

12:29.412 --> 12:35.567
That's my humour.
Thanks for coming out.

12:35.732 --> 12:41.682
Most people never take the time
to understand how the cable works.

12:41.852 --> 12:47.882
- Where exactly are we going?
- To ride the information highway.

13:11.372 --> 13:16.492
l come up here to think sometimes.
Clear my head.

13:16.652 --> 13:20.281
Brace yourself.

13:21.532 --> 13:23.409
There she is.

13:30.732 --> 13:35.362
She's sending entertainment and
information to millions of citizens.

13:35.532 --> 13:42.449
- That's pretty impressive.
- l knew you'd appreciate this.

13:48.692 --> 13:50.842
The future is now!

13:51.012 --> 13:55.449
Soon every home will integrate their
television, phone and computer.

13:55.612 --> 14:00.402
You'll be able to visit the Louvre,
or watch female mud wrestling.

14:00.572 --> 14:05.771
You can shop from your home, or play
video games with someone in Vietnam.

14:05.932 --> 14:10.323
There's no end to the possibilities!

14:12.692 --> 14:17.208
When l was a kid, my mom worked
nights. l never met my father.

14:17.372 --> 14:21.843
- But the TV was always there.
- l know what you mean.

14:22.012 --> 14:24.810
My dad might as well have been away.

14:27.812 --> 14:32.283
That's tough. You must have
a lot of abandonment issues.

14:32.452 --> 14:35.569
Reality isn't
''Father Knows Best'' any more.

14:35.732 --> 14:39.884
lt's a kick in the face
with a steel-toe work boot, -

14:40.052 --> 14:45.809
- and a trip to the hospital
for reconstructive surgery.

14:46.812 --> 14:50.930
But what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

14:51.612 --> 14:56.288
My brother is a speech therapist.

14:57.932 --> 15:01.004
So?

15:01.172 --> 15:04.084
Never mind.

15:06.172 --> 15:10.927
- You're pretty love-struck, huh?
- l miss her.

15:11.092 --> 15:16.007
- l proposed, and she kicked me out.
- l hate that.

15:16.172 --> 15:23.726
- She said l pressed too hard.
- Women are a labyrinth, my friend.

15:23.892 --> 15:26.850
Can l be frank?

15:27.012 --> 15:33.042
l don't think you listen to her.
You tell her what she wants to hear.

15:33.212 --> 15:37.251
She wants you to thirst
for knowledge about who she is.

15:37.412 --> 15:41.690
All the complicated splendor
that is woman.

15:41.852 --> 15:47.848
When your love is truly giving,
it will come back to you tenfold.

15:48.012 --> 15:51.721
You're right.
That's incredibly insightful.

15:51.892 --> 15:55.965
lt was Jerry Springer's
final thought on Friday's show.

16:02.972 --> 16:08.092
Women love ''Sleepless in Seattle.''
lt's on HBO this month.

16:08.252 --> 16:12.211
- That's your bait.
- Robin loves that movie.

16:12.372 --> 16:19.528
Tell her you're cooking yourself
dinner and watching it by yourself.

16:19.692 --> 16:25.050
- She'll come running.
- Maybe l'll give it a try.

16:25.212 --> 16:29.888
lt's embarrassing,
l don't even know your name.

16:30.052 --> 16:33.203
Do you really want to know my name?

16:33.372 --> 16:36.284
You do?

16:41.692 --> 16:47.881
lt's Ernie Douglas.
But my friends call me Chip.

16:58.852 --> 17:03.642
Goodbye.

17:04.652 --> 17:07.848
This concludes our broadcast day.
Click.

17:08.012 --> 17:12.961
l don't listen to you.
l pretend to understand.

17:13.132 --> 17:16.363
l'm just saying
what l think you want to hear.

17:16.531 --> 17:24.325
l'm interested in learning about the
complicated splendor that is you.

17:24.492 --> 17:31.011
l can see that taking this time
might be good for us. l'm not mad.

17:32.772 --> 17:38.130
- Sometimes time apart is healthy.
- You're right.

17:39.372 --> 17:43.524
That's what l came here to say.

17:43.692 --> 17:46.923
l have to get back to the office.

17:48.252 --> 17:54.441
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Cook dinner and watch a movie.

17:54.612 --> 17:59.481
- ''Sleepless in Seattle'' is on TV.
- l love that movie.

17:59.652 --> 18:02.803
Why don't you come by?

18:02.972 --> 18:07.762
- Maybe l will.
- Whatever.

18:11.932 --> 18:15.686
l'm Tabitha Soren.
Today in the Sam Sweet case, -

18:15.852 --> 18:20.687
- the prosecution played the call
Sam made on the night of the murder.

18:20.852 --> 18:23.889
Mr. Sweet confessed one month later.

18:24.052 --> 18:28.204
Oh, my God.
My twin brother's been shot.

18:28.372 --> 18:33.241
l think it was
an Asian gang or something!

18:33.412 --> 18:39.203
l saw someone. He was speaking
another language. l'm pretty sure -

18:39.852 --> 18:42.241
- it was Asian.

18:53.812 --> 18:56.770
He had the same injury last year.

18:56.932 --> 19:00.163
You guys play here too?

19:02.212 --> 19:06.364
l thought l'd see if anybody
wanted to play round ball.

19:06.532 --> 19:10.923
- Great. We need another man.
- Chip Douglas, my cable guy.

19:11.092 --> 19:14.767
We met a week ago,
but l feel l've always known him.

19:14.932 --> 19:18.242
That's sweet.

19:19.172 --> 19:23.131
- Chip Douglas, you're on my team.
- No way.

19:23.292 --> 19:28.412
- l'm on Steven's team.
- l'll switch teams. Let's play.

19:28.572 --> 19:32.326
l've got to warm up!
l don't want to pull a hammy.

19:57.212 --> 20:00.841
- Let's get it on .
- You any good?

20:01.012 --> 20:03.480
You'll find out.

20:03.652 --> 20:06.928
Check it.

20:07.092 --> 20:09.845
Looks good.

20:10.012 --> 20:14.244
Let's see what you got,
White Shadow.

20:14.412 --> 20:16.846
Foul!

20:17.012 --> 20:21.324
- That was a travel!
- Whatever you say, Chip!

20:21.492 --> 20:25.280
l see.
We're playing prison rules, huh?

21:02.772 --> 21:05.127
Feed me!

21:08.172 --> 21:14.850
Steven, l'm open!
Feed me the rock!

21:16.772 --> 21:20.048
Chip, over here!

21:51.332 --> 21:55.245
l love this game.

21:57.092 --> 22:01.847
- l guess we're done.
- Thanks for bringing your friend.

22:03.772 --> 22:09.961
l never made a slam dunk before.
Thanks for the boost.

22:12.372 --> 22:15.364
What are you doing?

22:15.532 --> 22:20.128
- l'm just talking trash.
- You ruined the game.

22:20.292 --> 22:23.807
Friends don't speak to each other
like that.

22:23.972 --> 22:28.090
We're not friends.
l don't even know you.

22:28.252 --> 22:34.327
- Let me buy you a Heineken.
- l'm going home.

22:34.492 --> 22:38.883
l guess we'll talk later.
l have to do some stuff anyway.

22:48.612 --> 22:52.730
You have 1 1 new messages.

22:52.892 --> 22:57.682
Steven, it's Mom. Call me.
l'm still your mother, you know.

22:57.852 --> 23:01.481
Steven, call your mother.

23:01.652 --> 23:06.851
Hey, Steven. Give me a ring.
l'm at 555-4329.

23:07.012 --> 23:12.530
l'm at a pay phone.
lf you're there, pick up.

23:12.692 --> 23:15.729
l'll be home later.

23:15.892 --> 23:20.807
Okay, l'm home.
Give me a buzz when you get in.

23:20.972 --> 23:25.807
lt's me again. l was taking a whiz.
Thought you might have called.

23:26.972 --> 23:30.760
We're having ourselves
a game of phone tag here.

23:32.292 --> 23:38.447
l was just blow-drying my hair ...
Thought l heard the phone ring.

23:39.772 --> 23:43.003
l think your machine is ...

23:53.172 --> 23:57.848
- Hey, good to see you.
- You too.

24:06.852 --> 24:09.969
- So how's work?
- Work's good.

24:10.132 --> 24:16.048
- How's Hal?
- The guy has no vision.

24:16.212 --> 24:21.809
lt's like working for Mr. Magoo.
And those hair plugs ...

24:21.972 --> 24:28.764
He's just an utterly useless person.
l think l hate him.

24:28.932 --> 24:35.280
- lt's nice to see you doing well.
- lt's nice just to see you.

24:36.452 --> 24:40.684
Hey.
lt should be on now.

24:49.092 --> 24:53.449
Damn it.
The cable's out.

24:54.332 --> 24:59.884
l know what to do.
The cable guy is a friend of mine.

25:00.052 --> 25:05.001
l'm a preferred customer.
All l have to do is page him.

25:18.412 --> 25:24.123
- Hi. ls there a problem?
- My cable's out.

25:25.772 --> 25:30.527
Really?
So you called me.

25:30.692 --> 25:34.128
Funny, how you call
when you need something.

25:34.292 --> 25:40.288
- ls that how you treat people?
- l've been busy. Robin is here.

25:41.772 --> 25:47.404
- This is important.
- But calling me back isn't?

25:47.572 --> 25:51.645
l'm sorry.
Can you help me out?

25:52.692 --> 25:57.891
Why should l help you?
l gave you free cable.

25:58.052 --> 26:02.091
- What have you ever done for me?
- Anything you want.

26:02.252 --> 26:07.645
- Tomorrow night we hang out.
- Fine, anything you want.

26:07.812 --> 26:13.648
God bless you.
You're too good to me.

26:22.372 --> 26:25.284
All set!

26:28.572 --> 26:34.204
- What's with the cut cord?
- That's for effect. Until tomorrow.

26:34.372 --> 26:38.411
She's pretty. Don't kiss her.
Don't even touch her.

26:38.572 --> 26:45.330
Resist the urge at all costs.
lt'll pay off in the end.

26:45.492 --> 26:48.165
See what l'm saying?

26:51.212 --> 26:54.329
Enjoy the flick.

26:56.692 --> 27:00.048
That was fast.

27:00.212 --> 27:04.683
- Are you okay?
- l'm fine. Don't l look fine?

27:04.852 --> 27:10.085
That isn't how it's done.
l'd rather just see somebody l like.

27:10.252 --> 27:15.770
Get a feeling about them,
and ask them if they'd like a drink.

27:15.932 --> 27:19.845
- Or a slice of pizza?
- Does it still work this way?

27:20.012 --> 27:23.971
- lt doesn't. They ask you.
- l'm starting to notice that.

27:24.132 --> 27:27.886
lf you get a new wife,
do you get to have sex with her?

27:28.052 --> 27:33.126
- l certainly hope so.
- Will she scratch up your back?

27:33.292 --> 27:35.283
What?

27:35.452 --> 27:39.764
ln movies, women always scratch
the man when they're having sex.

27:39.932 --> 27:43.925
- How do you know this?
- Jed's got cable.

27:53.092 --> 27:59.725
- Mommy's got to go out now.
- When will l get a brother?

27:59.892 --> 28:03.009
That's why Mommy is going out.

28:03.172 --> 28:08.200
Just sit there with Mr. Babysitter
and he'll take good care of you.

28:08.372 --> 28:12.923
Don't sit so close to that thing.
lt's going to rot your brain.

28:15.332 --> 28:20.645
- Why didn't you take my call?
- l can't always pick up the phone.

28:21.412 --> 28:25.769
Your nostrils flare
when you're mad.

28:33.572 --> 28:38.487
Sorry about yesterday.
How did everything go with you?

28:38.652 --> 28:42.247
- Keep them closed!
- Pretty well. The other night ...

28:42.412 --> 28:45.643
l want this to be a surprise.

28:45.812 --> 28:51.284
- Where are we going?
- The finest restaurant in town.

28:52.732 --> 28:55.769
Open ... sesame.

28:55.932 --> 28:58.685
Medieval Times?

29:00.772 --> 29:05.050
l knew you'd like it.
l come twice a week.

29:05.212 --> 29:12.288
l'm your serving wench, Melinda.
Care for something from the barkeep?

29:13.172 --> 29:16.164
Dost thust have thou a mug of ale?

29:16.332 --> 29:22.726
Me mate here, pitched in battle for
a fortnight, has a king's thirst.

29:24.492 --> 29:30.408
- l'll be right back, My Lord.
- My thanks to ye, fair wench.

29:32.852 --> 29:35.002
Thanks.

29:35.172 --> 29:41.327
- Look, l have to tell you ...
- Hold that thought. Show's on.

29:41.492 --> 29:47.681
Welcome to a magnificent journey ...
into the past.

29:47.852 --> 29:51.731
This is Medieval Times!

29:54.692 --> 29:58.924
Are you prepared for a night
of feasting and sport -

29:59.092 --> 30:02.801
- the likes of which
you'll never forget?

30:03.412 --> 30:08.008
Stand up and cheer
for your section's knight!

30:08.172 --> 30:12.245
Let the games begin!
The blue knight rules!

30:12.412 --> 30:19.329
The red knight sucks the big one!
You're going down, red knight!

30:19.492 --> 30:24.725
Going down, down, down!
Red knight going down!

30:27.892 --> 30:30.167
Smite him!

30:33.532 --> 30:38.765
- Could l get a knife and fork?
- There were none in medieval times.

30:38.932 --> 30:42.766
- More Pepsi?
- There was Pepsi, but no utensils?

30:42.932 --> 30:45.127
l've got a lot of tables.

30:50.252 --> 30:54.370
Can l have your skin?
Check this out.

31:00.612 --> 31:05.003
''Silence of the Lambs.''

31:05.172 --> 31:08.801
Hello, Clarice.
lt's good to see you again.

31:13.172 --> 31:17.051
This has nothing to do with you
as a person ...

31:17.212 --> 31:20.363
We have reached the climax
of our competition.

31:20.532 --> 31:27.688
Two noblemen from our audience
will battle to the death.

31:27.852 --> 31:34.769
Master Steven Kovacs and Lord Chip,
come to the fighting pit!

31:35.612 --> 31:38.763
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

31:38.932 --> 31:42.845
- We're going to do battle.
- ls this a normal part of the show?

31:43.012 --> 31:48.405
No, but l give all the knights
free cable.

31:48.572 --> 31:52.565
- ls it safe?
- Yes! That's what the armour's for!

31:54.452 --> 31:58.730
We have to be careful
not to hurt each other, right?

31:58.892 --> 32:04.888
l cannot listen to you,
for you are my sworn enemy.

32:10.572 --> 32:13.769
Just take it easy, all right?

32:21.012 --> 32:24.322
Nice move.

32:25.212 --> 32:28.727
Necessity ...
is the mother of invention.

32:31.812 --> 32:35.441
Come back ...
so that l may brain thee!

32:39.412 --> 32:43.610
My leg!
l have a cramp!

32:43.772 --> 32:46.684
Are you all right?

32:48.372 --> 32:51.728
l am now.

32:58.492 --> 33:00.687
Oh my God!

33:07.292 --> 33:12.446
That's the spirit!
Let's give them a show!

33:24.572 --> 33:30.522
l'm blinded! My eyes!

33:33.252 --> 33:36.722
l don't believe you.
lt's another trick.

33:36.892 --> 33:42.524
So that's how it's going to be?
You want to play rough?

33:42.692 --> 33:45.923
Daddy can play rough!

33:47.372 --> 33:53.288
This is like when Spock fought Kirk.
Best friends forced to do battle.

34:13.812 --> 34:17.600
Chip, this isn't funny!
Stop it!

34:18.612 --> 34:24.482
The name is Spock. lf we don't fight
to the death, they'll kill us both.

34:24.652 --> 34:27.120
This isn't ''Star Trek''.

34:32.331 --> 34:35.847
Goodbye, Jim.

34:52.092 --> 34:55.289
Good fight.

34:55.452 --> 34:58.808
Keep eating!

35:01.252 --> 35:04.369
Quickly! Muster atop your steed.

35:06.452 --> 35:11.845
Get on the friggin' horse.
l don't think he's kidding.

35:12.012 --> 35:16.688
- Don't do this!
- Good luck to you!

35:16.852 --> 35:21.562
- This is our destiny!
- No, it's not!

35:21.732 --> 35:25.691
- Yes, it is!
- No, it isn't!

35:35.132 --> 35:38.044
Are you all right?

35:42.772 --> 35:47.402
Well done, good sir.
You are the victor.

35:47.572 --> 35:50.962
But we will meet again.

36:06.412 --> 36:10.007
Did you hear that?

36:10.172 --> 36:15.644
- You have a warrior's instinct.
- l had a real feeling of power.

36:15.812 --> 36:20.044
lf Robin had seen you,
she'd be begging you to come back.

36:20.212 --> 36:23.443
These knights get laid all the time!

36:23.612 --> 36:27.321
We should go again next week.

36:27.492 --> 36:33.169
- You have no messages.
- Nobody loves you.

36:33.332 --> 36:39.009
l left something in the living room.
Will you check it out for me?

36:39.172 --> 36:42.960
Just a little piece of equipment.

36:48.532 --> 36:53.925
- What do you think?
- What is all this?

36:54.732 --> 37:01.365
lt appears as if someone has updated
your home entertainment system.

37:02.092 --> 37:07.086
l got you the big-screen TV,
deluxe karaoke machine -

37:07.252 --> 37:12.531
- and THX quality sound that would
make George Lucas cream his pants.

37:12.692 --> 37:19.450
- You got in here when l was out?
- How else could l get the stuff in?

37:19.612 --> 37:23.651
- How much did all of this cost?
- Practically nothing.

37:23.812 --> 37:28.727
l have a connection.
l hook him up, he hooks me up.

37:28.892 --> 37:33.329
- l can't accept this.
- Why not?

37:33.492 --> 37:37.405
You give me something more valuable.
Friendship.

37:37.572 --> 37:44.284
You give me friendship. We're even.
You have to take this stuff back.

37:47.892 --> 37:55.162
- Can l leave it here till Saturday.
- Sure. No problem.

37:55.332 --> 38:01.567
Hi, this is Robin Harris. Steven
doesn't live here any more ...

38:01.732 --> 38:06.965
Hey, it's Steven.
l'm still trying to reach you ...

38:07.132 --> 38:10.647
l'm at the office. Call me.

38:11.572 --> 38:14.644
- How's it going?
- Good.

38:14.812 --> 38:19.169
Good.
Keep it up. lt's your ass.

38:19.332 --> 38:22.608
lt's Robin on line two.

38:22.772 --> 38:27.527
l had the best time the other night.
When will l see you again?

38:27.692 --> 38:33.085
- How about tomorrow?
- Chip!

38:33.252 --> 38:36.722
l knew l'd get you
on the phone that way.

38:36.892 --> 38:42.012
Let's break the cherry
on that karaoke machine.

38:42.172 --> 38:46.688
- What does that mean?
- Karaoke jam. No ifs, ands or buts.

38:46.852 --> 38:52.051
Maybe a few buts.
Big ones!

39:12.532 --> 39:15.524
You're going on a date?

39:15.692 --> 39:22.370
We're not officially back together.
And you said time apart is good.

39:22.532 --> 39:27.481
Yes. Time apart from each other,
but not with other people.

39:27.652 --> 39:29.688
That's time with someone else.

39:29.852 --> 39:35.165
- l love you, but l have to go. Bye.
- Bye.

39:42.892 --> 39:47.010
This is just a sign
that you need to live a little.

39:48.212 --> 39:53.730
- She's having fun. You should, too.
- Maybe you're right.

39:54.492 --> 40:00.681
- l got you a little something.
- You said we were even.

40:00.852 --> 40:05.721
You're breaking the rules.
What is it?

40:09.252 --> 40:13.723
LOOSE YOUR LlSP
lN 30 DAYS

40:13.892 --> 40:17.487
My brother thought
it might help you.

40:17.652 --> 40:23.329
- This is ... There's no words ...
- lt's no big deal.

40:23.492 --> 40:27.610
Yes, it is!
lt is to me.

40:27.772 --> 40:32.368
Now l'm on a mission.

40:32.532 --> 40:37.560
This is going to be
the best damn karaoke jam ever.

40:46.652 --> 40:50.645
We're really bopping!

40:51.932 --> 40:56.687
- You have some nice friends.
- They're just preferred customers.

40:56.852 --> 41:01.323
Chick alert, two o'clock.
What a licorice!

41:04.732 --> 41:08.202
- Don't look.
- You're just playing with me.

41:08.372 --> 41:13.162
- She's all over you.
- Shut up.

41:13.332 --> 41:19.043
l'd strike while the iron is hot.
He who hesitates, masturbates.

41:19.212 --> 41:22.204
Go.

41:23.652 --> 41:28.806
- Hey. l'm Steven.
- Heather.

41:28.972 --> 41:34.410
- Can l get you a beer?
- How about a tequila?

41:38.572 --> 41:41.644
Hi, Rick.

41:41.812 --> 41:44.451
That'll be a good one.

41:44.612 --> 41:49.242
- Glad you accepted my invitation.
- Steven invited me.

41:49.412 --> 41:52.484
He's having a super time.

41:54.732 --> 42:00.364
He's changing. You'll have to learn
to live with that.

42:02.252 --> 42:08.361
l don't know what your story is,
but l'm going to find out.

42:08.532 --> 42:15.370
Don't dig too deep. You might
get burned by the molten lava.

42:16.412 --> 42:19.848
l'm out of here.

42:26.132 --> 42:29.044
Thank you.

42:30.852 --> 42:35.721
The soothing sounds of Raoul,
ladies and gentlemen.

42:35.892 --> 42:40.124
- You had honey in your voice.
- Do a song for us.

42:40.292 --> 42:43.568
No, l couldn't.

42:43.732 --> 42:47.566
All right, already!

42:47.732 --> 42:50.690
l fought the law, and the law won.

42:52.372 --> 42:57.366
Jefferson Airplane performed
this song in ''Gimme Shelter'', -

42:57.532 --> 43:02.526
- a film about how the Hell's Angels
had their way at a Stones concert.

43:02.692 --> 43:06.082
Tonight ... it's my turn.

43:34.172 --> 43:41.089
- What do you do?
- Can we talk in the other room?

45:00.212 --> 45:04.000
We just had a baby born
at the party.

45:04.172 --> 45:08.404
We need an ambulance
over by the scaffolding.

45:08.572 --> 45:11.882
Shut the door!

45:26.412 --> 45:32.647
lt's the summer of love, baby.
Let's leave these two alone.

45:32.812 --> 45:36.691
Smile!
That's going to be a good one.

45:51.812 --> 45:56.044
Good morning,
and how are we today?

45:56.212 --> 46:00.763
l borrowed this sweatshirt.
Bacon and eggs, coming up.

46:00.932 --> 46:06.131
- Where did Heather go?
- She left early this morning.

46:06.292 --> 46:09.284
You cad.

46:10.372 --> 46:16.129
- What a night. Just what l needed.
- l'll tell you something.

46:16.292 --> 46:20.126
You look like a new man.

46:20.292 --> 46:26.208
l was getting so used to rejection.
l really liked her.

46:26.372 --> 46:30.331
lt was my treat.

46:31.172 --> 46:38.248
- What do you mean?
- You can buy next time.

46:39.692 --> 46:45.881
- Don't let your eggs get cold.
- Buy what?

46:46.052 --> 46:52.048
What do you mean, buy what?
The women.

46:52.212 --> 46:56.728
Do you mean
that Heather is a prostitute?

46:56.892 --> 47:01.647
Of course. We couldn't get
a woman like that without paying.

47:01.812 --> 47:04.690
This can't be happening.

47:04.852 --> 47:13.647
lt's okay. She's totally clean.
l checked her out about a week ago.

47:13.812 --> 47:20.365
To make sure she was good. And l'm
healthy as a horse ... Not a drip.

47:21.612 --> 47:27.801
- Would you like some juice?
- You're kidding. She's your friend.

47:27.972 --> 47:32.648
- l wish l had friends like that.
- Get out of my house!

47:32.812 --> 47:37.203
She was a working girl,
but she liked you.

47:37.372 --> 47:40.887
You might even have got a freebie.

47:41.052 --> 47:46.001
l don't ever want to see you again.
Robin will never forgive me.

47:46.172 --> 47:49.801
Don't tell her.
l'll help you get her back.

47:49.972 --> 47:54.011
l want you out of my apartment.
And get this stuff out of here.

47:54.172 --> 47:58.927
Why are you doing this?
You're sabotaging yourself.

47:59.092 --> 48:01.526
Out! Now!

48:01.692 --> 48:05.241
Everything was going so well.

48:05.412 --> 48:09.325
l made you breakfast,
and we were eating ...

48:09.492 --> 48:11.767
Out!

48:11.932 --> 48:16.642
l'll fix this.
l can make it cool again.

48:16.812 --> 48:19.610
This is just a speed bump!

48:23.892 --> 48:27.885
- May l help you?
- No. l'm meeting someone here.

48:40.172 --> 48:43.960
l apologize about last night.
l came home and l just fell asleep.

48:53.772 --> 48:57.082
Most appreciated.

48:57.252 --> 49:02.485
Gail tells me
you're coming out of a relationship.

49:02.652 --> 49:07.965
- We're in a holding pattern.
- A holding pattern?

49:08.132 --> 49:12.045
You need to come down and refuel.

49:13.612 --> 49:15.807
You're sexy.

49:20.732 --> 49:25.601
You've been working hard.
Take a break.

49:32.092 --> 49:35.448
Excuse me.
What's the story with our chicken?

49:35.612 --> 49:42.563
Have the eggs had a chance to hatch?
Maybe you can go check on it for me.

49:43.372 --> 49:45.840
l'm sorry to put you out.

49:46.012 --> 49:48.480
Unbelievable.

49:48.652 --> 49:52.645
l'm hysterical now.
What were we talking about?

49:52.812 --> 50:00.446
- What's your job like?
- lt's a little crazy right now ...

50:00.612 --> 50:07.723
Wait. l need to use the head.
l want to find out about your job.

50:07.892 --> 50:10.360
What's with the chicken?

50:16.212 --> 50:19.443
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

50:19.612 --> 50:22.490
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, stretch.

50:22.652 --> 50:27.772
- Pleasant night, isn't it?
- Yeah, not too bad.

50:27.932 --> 50:35.122
The weather is always nice in here.
The winters are remarkably mild!

50:39.692 --> 50:45.449
- lf you need anything, let me know!
- l got it under control!

50:45.612 --> 50:49.127
- Unbelievable.
- lt's no trouble.

50:49.292 --> 50:52.204
What is your ..?

50:52.176 --> 50:56.567
People rarely take advantage of
my services. l'll help you wash up.

50:56.736 --> 50:59.489
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

51:03.256 --> 51:06.566
You're on a big date.

51:07.376 --> 51:09.970
You'll need to look your best.

51:13.096 --> 51:18.250
That'll take care of the shine.
Now, let's pluck those eyebrows!

51:18.416 --> 51:21.852
She loves me, she loves me not.
She loves me ...

51:22.016 --> 51:25.691
... she loves me not.

51:25.856 --> 51:29.371
A little Jose Eber ...

51:32.696 --> 51:34.891
A touch of Alfalfa ...

51:35.056 --> 51:38.685
We're ready to dry you off!

51:38.856 --> 51:43.088
Right into the buckle.
That's got to hurt!

51:46.536 --> 51:49.573
Suck the air.

51:49.736 --> 51:53.172
You look just like Dizzy Gillespie.

52:06.056 --> 52:11.050
Don't worry about the tip.
But l've got one for you.

52:11.216 --> 52:15.573
Stay away from Robin.
She's taken.

52:23.016 --> 52:28.773
A man was beaten in a restroom
by a bathroom attendant.

52:28.936 --> 52:36.616
The victim is unable to speak, but
witnesses described the assailant.

52:36.776 --> 52:40.769
Tonight on UPN: The trial
that has captured the nation.

52:40.936 --> 52:46.090
Everyone awaits the verdict,
but we're showing the movie now.

52:46.256 --> 52:49.851
- Cry - baby.
- l love you.

52:50.016 --> 52:54.965
- No, Sammy!
- Look who's crying now.

52:55.136 --> 53:00.972
Eric Roberts is Sam and Stan Sweet
in "Brother Sweet Brother".

53:01.136 --> 53:03.445
Parental discretion advised.

53:14.896 --> 53:19.253
- Who is it?
- lt's the cable guy!

53:19.416 --> 53:22.647
My cable's fine.

53:22.816 --> 53:28.129
l have an upgrade order
for one Robin Harris.

53:28.296 --> 53:32.050
l didn't order that.

53:33.576 --> 53:36.932
l guess you have a secret admirer.

53:40.016 --> 53:43.850
- ls it a man named Steven?
- l can't say.

53:44.016 --> 53:48.407
l promised Steven l wouldn't say.
Oh, look what l've done.

53:48.576 --> 53:52.455
- You didn't hear it from me.
- Hold on.

54:11.896 --> 54:16.287
- Male witches are the worst kind.
- He's not a witch.

54:22.536 --> 54:26.495
That about does it.
My work is done.

54:30.176 --> 54:33.964
That was hot up there.

54:36.416 --> 54:40.887
- Are you a friend of Steven's?
- l'm proud to say that l am.

54:41.056 --> 54:45.334
l recently installed his cable
and we just hit it off.

54:45.496 --> 54:50.047
- Are you guys going out a lot?
- Not really.

54:50.216 --> 54:53.606
That guy is devoted to you.

54:53.776 --> 54:57.371
l shouldn't be telling you this ...

54:57.536 --> 55:02.052
... but he thinks
you're the cat's pyjamas.

55:02.216 --> 55:05.333
Did he say that?

55:05.496 --> 55:11.287
Only every five minutes.
Frankly l'm sick of hearing it.

55:11.456 --> 55:14.448
He's a good man.

55:14.616 --> 55:19.929
He mentioned
that you've had some problems.

55:20.096 --> 55:24.453
- lt's a little complicated.
- lt always is.

55:24.616 --> 55:28.006
l asked a woman to marry me once.

55:28.176 --> 55:34.331
She wanted to think about it.
We agreed to take some time apart.

55:34.496 --> 55:39.047
You know ...
give each other space.

55:42.016 --> 55:44.689
She's no longer with us.

55:46.776 --> 55:49.210
l'm sorry.

55:49.376 --> 55:55.087
Sometimes you don't know
what you've got till it's gone.

55:56.496 --> 56:02.651
Promise me you'll never
go bungee jumping in Mexico.

56:02.816 --> 56:06.729
- l promise.
- Anyway ...

56:06.896 --> 56:10.571
l've said too much.

56:12.296 --> 56:15.129
Thank you.

56:16.456 --> 56:20.688
Cherish him, Robin.
Every hair on his head.

56:26.736 --> 56:29.569
Excuse me.

56:29.736 --> 56:32.125
- Hello.
- l love you.

56:32.296 --> 56:36.175
Robin?
l love you, too.

56:36.336 --> 56:40.488
That was so sweet of you.

56:40.656 --> 56:44.490
- You didn't have to do that.
- l ... l wanted to.

56:44.656 --> 56:48.569
Giving me free cable. Only you
would do something like that.

56:52.096 --> 56:57.045
l wanted to do something for you,
but you needed space, so ...

56:57.216 --> 57:01.209
Let's not make any more rules.

57:01.376 --> 57:07.975
- Call me later if you're around.
- Sure, as soon as l get home.

57:08.136 --> 57:11.572
- Bye.
- Bye.

57:11.736 --> 57:17.413
- Are you ready to rock?
- The concert. Oh, Jesus.

57:17.576 --> 57:21.455
l think Robin and l
are getting back together.

57:21.616 --> 57:28.408
So you're blowing me off again.
l won't put up with it any more.

57:35.456 --> 57:41.326
- Can't you ask someone else to go?
- Maybe l'll take my cable guy.

57:47.056 --> 57:50.765
l'll call you later ...

57:55.296 --> 57:59.733
Pretty smooth work.
l set them up, you knock them down.

58:00.616 --> 58:06.725
- What?
- Robin. l got her back for you.

58:06.896 --> 58:11.287
- How do you know about us?
- Free cable's an aphrodisiac.

58:11.456 --> 58:17.292
- Don't mess around with my life.
- l wanted to make things up to you.

58:20.096 --> 58:22.735
Do you want to catch a flick?

58:27.056 --> 58:31.607
l appreciate
you helping me out with Robin.

58:31.776 --> 58:39.091
Now l'll have to work extra hard
not to screw things up again.

58:39.256 --> 58:47.254
You're a nice guy, but l just
don't have time for a new friend.

58:50.056 --> 58:56.814
- What are you trying to say?
- l don't want to be your friend.

58:59.176 --> 59:04.011
l appreciate your honesty.
You're a straight shooter.

59:05.016 --> 59:10.807
- So you're all right?
- l'm a big boy.

59:10.976 --> 59:14.935
lt's no big deal.
Whatever.

59:18.216 --> 59:24.735
- You're sure?
- Uh-huh. l'm fine.

59:42.336 --> 59:46.375
- Robin Harris.
- Hey, it's Chip Douglas.

59:46.536 --> 59:52.247
- Chip Douglas?
- The cable guy.

59:52.416 --> 59:59.606
- What's up?
- l'm worried about Steven.

59:59.776 --> 01:00:06.124
- What is it?
- He doesn't seem like himself.

01:00:06.296 --> 01:00:11.928
- Have you noticed anything?
- No. Things are going really well.

01:00:12.096 --> 01:00:17.807
Good.
That makes me feel better.

01:00:17.976 --> 01:00:24.370
- Should l be worried?
- No. Maybe l'm being too nervous.

01:00:26.576 --> 01:00:30.330
Let's just keep our eyes open.

01:00:31.616 --> 01:00:34.414
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:00:35.776 --> 01:00:39.325
Stevie, you did it, man.

01:00:39.496 --> 01:00:43.933
You put our cajones on the table
and you slam-dunked it.

01:00:44.096 --> 01:00:47.213
Way to go. Now they'll probably
give him my job.

01:00:47.376 --> 01:00:53.053
- On to the next order of business.
- Steven, l need to talk to you.

01:00:54.656 --> 01:00:58.729
We have to find an architect.

01:00:58.896 --> 01:01:02.571
- l need to talk to you.
- lt shall wait.

01:01:02.736 --> 01:01:09.130
- ls there a Steven Kovacs here?
- Yeah. What's the problem?

01:01:09.296 --> 01:01:13.175
You're under arrest
for receiving stolen property.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:18.535
- l don't know anything about this.
- Do not speak until spoken to.

01:01:18.696 --> 01:01:23.451
You have the right to remain silent.

01:01:23.616 --> 01:01:27.814
- You have the right to an attorney.
- l didn't accept any stolen goods.

01:01:27.976 --> 01:01:32.413
Deluxe karaoke machine.
Big - screen TV ...

01:01:32.576 --> 01:01:35.215
Cream his pants ...

01:01:42.296 --> 01:01:45.254
l can't believe you did this.

01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:51.605
He gave you a big-screen TV
and a hi-fi system as a present?

01:01:51.776 --> 01:01:55.291
- l swear it's true.
- Why would you accept such gifts?

01:01:55.456 --> 01:02:01.292
- l don't know.
- What's going on? Are you on pot?

01:02:01.456 --> 01:02:05.244
l didn't do anything!
Just call my cable guy.

01:02:05.416 --> 01:02:10.934
Nobody named Chip Douglas
works for the cable company.

01:02:11.096 --> 01:02:15.453
- This can't be happening.
- lt's killing your mother.

01:02:15.616 --> 01:02:20.531
- When can you get me out?
- There'll be no bail hearing today.

01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:23.893
You have to spend the weekend here.

01:02:24.056 --> 01:02:27.014
Look at the pretty boy!

01:02:30.256 --> 01:02:35.171
They call me the pumper.
l'll be your friend.

01:02:35.336 --> 01:02:38.328
Lock down!

01:02:47.256 --> 01:02:50.771
You hear anything?

01:02:52.696 --> 01:02:55.494
l came as soon as l could.

01:02:55.656 --> 01:02:59.934
- What's your real name?
- Larry Tate. That's not important.

01:03:00.096 --> 01:03:04.965
We have to get you out of here.
l was watching Court TV.

01:03:05.136 --> 01:03:09.766
l'll talk to the judge.
l'll put the system on trial!

01:03:09.936 --> 01:03:14.134
- Why are you doing this to me?
- You did this to you.

01:03:14.296 --> 01:03:19.575
- You set me up.
- No. l taught you a lesson.

01:03:19.736 --> 01:03:24.491
l can be your friend or your enemy.
You seem to prefer the latter.

01:03:24.656 --> 01:03:26.886
l'm just here to comfort you.

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:33.288
Touch it.
You need human contact.

01:03:33.456 --> 01:03:36.414
l will not touch it.

01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:42.852
- What are you doing?
- l know how you're feeling!

01:03:43.016 --> 01:03:48.010
- Don't do that.
- l'm here for you!

01:03:49.216 --> 01:03:53.129
Don't do that! You'll get me killed!

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:57.091
Oh, Billy.

01:04:03.896 --> 01:04:06.615
l'm just messing with you.

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:10.894
Remember ''Midnight Express''?
Oliver Stone won an Academy Award.

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:13.286
Awesome scene.

01:04:13.456 --> 01:04:17.335
This is the man who framed me!

01:04:17.496 --> 01:04:21.250
Hey Bernie,
how's that sports package?

01:04:24.216 --> 01:04:30.974
Don't worry about Robin.
l'll take care of her.

01:04:31.696 --> 01:04:37.293
- lf you go near her, l'll kill you.
- That's it. Let's go!

01:04:39.336 --> 01:04:45.093
This concludes our broadcast day.
Click.

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:49.135
- You've been blowing me off.
- This guy's doing a number on me.

01:04:49.296 --> 01:04:52.811
- l told you to stay away from him.
- You said l could get free cable.

01:04:52.976 --> 01:04:56.651
Did l tell you
to have a karaoke jam with him?

01:04:56.816 --> 01:05:00.604
l'm out on bail.

01:05:03.696 --> 01:05:07.928
l'll see if l can track him down.
What was his name?

01:05:08.096 --> 01:05:12.965
Larry Tate. But at first he said
his name was Chip Douglas.

01:05:13.136 --> 01:05:17.049
Chip Douglas?
That sounds familiar.

01:05:18.176 --> 01:05:20.770
- Are you okay?
- l'm fine.

01:05:20.936 --> 01:05:25.134
- You're not fine.
- l just want to get this over with.

01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:27.730
l hate visiting my parents.

01:05:29.416 --> 01:05:35.048
ls this guy cool?
Just joking. Come in, you psycho.

01:05:35.696 --> 01:05:40.406
- What is he doing here?
- l invited him.

01:05:40.576 --> 01:05:43.568
- l invited him at lunch.
- At lunch?

01:05:43.736 --> 01:05:48.127
- You look great.
- And you are a vision.

01:05:48.296 --> 01:05:53.575
- You look rested.
- Come here.

01:05:54.096 --> 01:05:59.693
- What's wrong? You seem weird.
- You had me sent to jail.

01:05:59.856 --> 01:06:04.725
- l should take you to the police.
- You can if you like.

01:06:04.896 --> 01:06:08.525
But l'd hate
to have to show Robin this.

01:06:09.056 --> 01:06:14.176
- Bastard!
- Let's just have a good time.

01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:21.847
Steven is carrying his battle axe
and chasing me ...

01:06:22.016 --> 01:06:26.407
So l say, ''Hey, it's just a show!''

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:34.567
- He takes things too seriously.
- The guy almost took my head off.

01:06:40.136 --> 01:06:44.891
Did never played Porno Password?
lt's the adult version of the show.

01:06:45.056 --> 01:06:49.607
Robin, you're on my team.
Steven ... you're with Mom.

01:06:49.776 --> 01:06:52.290
You're the judges.

01:06:52.456 --> 01:06:54.970
Pick a word.

01:07:04.856 --> 01:07:08.451
The password is ...

01:07:08.616 --> 01:07:11.369
Vagina.

01:07:11.536 --> 01:07:15.415
- l really don't want to play.
- Come on, Steven.

01:07:18.376 --> 01:07:21.209
Woman.

01:07:21.376 --> 01:07:24.573
- Woman.
- Man?

01:07:28.776 --> 01:07:32.530
Penis.

01:07:33.976 --> 01:07:37.013
Penis.

01:07:39.056 --> 01:07:41.968
- Penis.
- Vagina.

01:07:45.016 --> 01:07:48.247
She got vagina!

01:07:48.416 --> 01:07:53.570
- l would have said ''schlong''.
- Now we're starting to get this!

01:08:01.416 --> 01:08:05.648
The password is ...

01:08:07.136 --> 01:08:10.014
Nipple.

01:08:10.176 --> 01:08:13.532
- Can l pass?
- Don't be a stick in the mud!

01:08:15.896 --> 01:08:18.888
Breast.

01:08:19.055 --> 01:08:21.729
Breast.

01:08:21.895 --> 01:08:24.808
Tit?

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:31.046
Remember his clue.

01:08:31.696 --> 01:08:34.813
Hard.

01:08:37.296 --> 01:08:42.006
- Erection?
- No. But thanks for noticing.

01:08:44.296 --> 01:08:48.846
- Your turn!
- Center.

01:08:50.736 --> 01:08:53.694
Center.

01:08:54.856 --> 01:08:58.531
- Center!
- Nipple?

01:08:58.696 --> 01:09:02.211
- She got it!
- Mom.

01:09:08.176 --> 01:09:11.805
The password is ...

01:09:11.975 --> 01:09:15.764
l'm not sure how to say this.

01:09:15.935 --> 01:09:19.053
That little thing ...

01:09:19.216 --> 01:09:23.368
- l can't say that to my mother.
- She can handle it.

01:09:23.536 --> 01:09:26.926
l won't do it. l've had enough!

01:09:27.095 --> 01:09:32.613
- lt's just skin, Steven.
- l don't want to do it any more!

01:09:32.776 --> 01:09:37.531
- You're overreacting.
- No! He's fooling you all.

01:09:37.696 --> 01:09:43.930
- He's a lunatic and a felon.
- Everybody just relax.

01:09:44.095 --> 01:09:49.011
- We knew this would happen.
- Nothing is happening!

01:09:49.176 --> 01:09:53.886
This is a safe place.
You're with people who love you.

01:09:54.055 --> 01:09:58.766
- We love you.
- l hate you! Get out of my life!

01:09:58.936 --> 01:10:03.930
- He's angry with me. l should go.
- No.

01:10:04.096 --> 01:10:08.328
- You are being an asshole.
- Do you see what's happening?

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:12.284
- You're hitting bottom.
- Stay away.

01:10:12.456 --> 01:10:17.246
This is where the healing begins.
Come on.

01:10:18.176 --> 01:10:23.614
Robin showed me her birthmark.
lt's very sexy.

01:10:28.736 --> 01:10:31.887
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:10:34.056 --> 01:10:39.005
Thanks for the delightful evening.
l guess l'll be leaving now.

01:10:46.656 --> 01:10:52.526
l forgive you. l only hope
my neurologist will feel the same.

01:11:02.376 --> 01:11:02.616
- Did anybody notice l'm late?
- You've been here for an hour.

01:11:02.616 --> 01:11:06.689
- Did anybody notice l'm late?
- You've been here for an hour.

01:11:08.376 --> 01:11:13.575
HELLO STEVEN
l'VE GOT A PRESENT FOR YOU

01:11:18.376 --> 01:11:23.052
- How's Hal?
- The man has no vision.

01:11:23.216 --> 01:11:29.371
lt's like working for Mr. Magoo.
lf only someone would dump him.

01:11:29.536 --> 01:11:33.245
And those hair plugs ...

01:11:33.416 --> 01:11:37.614
- Hair plugs. Hair plugs ...
- Oh, shit.

01:11:37.776 --> 01:11:43.169
He's so pathetic.
l think l hate him. Hate him ...

01:11:51.696 --> 01:11:54.927
lf only someone would dump him.

01:12:02.016 --> 01:12:05.452
l ... l don't hate you.

01:12:05.616 --> 01:12:09.973
- Those hair plugs.
- Get out!

01:12:35.576 --> 01:12:38.568
Chip!

01:12:39.736 --> 01:12:42.648
This isn't funny!

01:12:43.896 --> 01:12:47.172
Where are you?

01:12:50.776 --> 01:12:54.564
lf you build it, he will come.

01:13:09.896 --> 01:13:13.889
- Hello?
- Bingo! ''My Three Sons''.

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:19.608
- Chip and Ernie Douglas.
- l have a list of ex-cable men.

01:13:19.776 --> 01:13:21.892
Murray Slaughter.

01:13:22.056 --> 01:13:24.650
George Jetson. Jean Luc Picard.

01:13:24.816 --> 01:13:29.492
- Someone called the Big Ragoo.
- Carmine, from ''Laverne & Shirley''.

01:13:29.656 --> 01:13:36.926
Anyway, the cable company in town
fired a guy six months ago.

01:13:37.096 --> 01:13:43.171
His boss was Larry Tate,
from a show called ''Bewitched''.

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:47.693
- He's not with the cable company?
- Yahtzee!

01:13:48.616 --> 01:13:55.692
They fired him for stalking
customers. You better lock up tight.

01:13:55.856 --> 01:14:01.055
ln the Sam Sweet Trial,
the jury is close to a verdict.

01:14:01.216 --> 01:14:06.244
They will continue deliberating
into the evening hours.

01:14:06.416 --> 01:14:11.536
The day started real nice,
but now the moisture is increasing.

01:14:11.696 --> 01:14:15.006
We see thunderstorms ...

01:14:20.336 --> 01:14:23.089
Cable guy!

01:14:24.776 --> 01:14:27.449
Cable guy!

01:14:40.336 --> 01:14:43.646
Jesucristo!

01:14:44.296 --> 01:14:47.652
Cable guy!

01:15:10.416 --> 01:15:14.250
Okay, l'm going!

01:15:17.056 --> 01:15:20.651
See you! Bye.

01:15:35.696 --> 01:15:39.735
l just want to hang out!
No big deal!

01:16:02.096 --> 01:16:06.135
- Hello?
- We could have been blood brothers.

01:16:06.296 --> 01:16:10.926
But you're too needy.
lt's a real turn-off. Ask Robin.

01:16:11.096 --> 01:16:14.566
The cable company fired you.

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:19.093
Hold on.
l have a call waiting.

01:16:32.016 --> 01:16:35.770
- l know it's you.
- Sorry. Where was l?

01:16:35.936 --> 01:16:39.053
- Can't we work this out?
- l wish we could.

01:16:39.216 --> 01:16:45.928
- l'm just so tired, Steven.
- Where are you?

01:16:46.096 --> 01:16:53.047
l'd love to chat, but l'm
getting together with a lady friend.

01:16:53.896 --> 01:16:58.890
- You might know her.
- Stay away from her!

01:17:04.336 --> 01:17:11.447
- Robin!
- She just left with the cable guy!

01:17:11.616 --> 01:17:14.494
Where were they going?

01:17:14.656 --> 01:17:20.174
l heard him say they were taking
a ride on the information highway.

01:17:25.376 --> 01:17:29.005
The future is now!

01:17:29.176 --> 01:17:33.966
Soon every home will integrate their
television, phone and computer!

01:17:34.136 --> 01:17:39.813
You'll be able to visit the Louvre,
or watch female mud wrestling.

01:17:39.976 --> 01:17:46.415
You can shop from your home, or play
video games with someone in Vietnam.

01:17:51.256 --> 01:17:54.453
l want to go home now.
l'm worried about Steven.

01:18:20.336 --> 01:18:23.965
- Help!
- Robin!

01:18:25.456 --> 01:18:28.016
Where are you?

01:18:28.176 --> 01:18:32.328
- Steven!
- l'm coming!

01:18:38.136 --> 01:18:41.924
- Help me!
- Hang on!

01:18:50.816 --> 01:18:56.368
- Steven, look out!
- Yes, Steven! Look out!

01:19:07.456 --> 01:19:13.770
''Dry land is not a myth!''
Kevin Costner, ''Waterworld''.

01:19:13.936 --> 01:19:19.647
- Leave him alone!
- l saw that movie six times!

01:19:21.776 --> 01:19:25.325
lsn't it funny
that we ended up like this?

01:19:33.096 --> 01:19:37.692
You'll have to do
better than that, Steven.

01:19:42.216 --> 01:19:45.765
My lisp is gone!

01:19:46.936 --> 01:19:49.973
You stupid son-of-a-bitch.

01:19:52.376 --> 01:19:56.972
- Stop it! Steven!
- l'm coming!

01:20:06.096 --> 01:20:11.568
The trouble with real life is,
there's no danger music.

01:20:23.176 --> 01:20:27.010
Nice jump, Spiderman!

01:20:30.456 --> 01:20:35.735
Steven called the fuzz!

01:20:35.896 --> 01:20:39.445
Bad boys,
what you gonna do?

01:20:40.736 --> 01:20:44.331
Skooch over just a tad.

01:20:52.016 --> 01:20:54.769
Here comes our hero.

01:20:54.936 --> 01:20:59.293
- lt didn't have to be this way.
- What are you planning to do?

01:20:59.456 --> 01:21:06.771
l don't really have a plan.
l'm going moment to moment now.

01:21:06.936 --> 01:21:10.565
You have to admit,
it's a cool place for an ending.

01:21:10.736 --> 01:21:13.887
- An ending to what?
- lt's like ''Golden Eye''.

01:21:14.056 --> 01:21:19.926
This isn't a movie!
This is reality!

01:21:20.096 --> 01:21:24.647
This is the police! You're
trespassing in a restricted area!

01:21:31.216 --> 01:21:34.686
l just wanted to be your friend ...

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:38.485
... but l screwed it up.

01:21:39.336 --> 01:21:45.286
- You are in a high - voltage area!
- What's that?

01:21:46.856 --> 01:21:49.689
Come again?

01:21:51.496 --> 01:21:57.605
You want me to quiet down
and chill out in front of the TV?

01:22:01.016 --> 01:22:04.213
You were never there for me,
were you, Mother?

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:11.815
You expected Mike and Carol Brady
to raise me.

01:22:11.976 --> 01:22:19.212
l'm the bastard son of Claire
Huxtable! l'm the lost Cunningham!

01:22:19.816 --> 01:22:26.335
l learned the facts of life ...
from watching ''The Facts of Life''!

01:22:36.696 --> 01:22:40.052
That's it.

01:22:42.936 --> 01:22:46.212
That's what l have to do!

01:22:47.176 --> 01:22:50.725
No. Don't do that!

01:22:50.896 --> 01:22:55.333
- Let's go out and have a Heineken.
- Yeah!

01:22:55.496 --> 01:22:58.488
l'm not thirsty any more.

01:22:59.056 --> 01:23:02.366
See ya.

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:12.973
You're not going anywhere!

01:23:13.136 --> 01:23:18.210
lt's okay!
l understand my purpose now!

01:23:18.376 --> 01:23:22.255
Don't do this. You just need help.
We all get lonely.

01:23:22.416 --> 01:23:28.252
But l get really lonely.
Look at me!

01:23:31.576 --> 01:23:38.926
- l'll be your pal. Just come on up!
- No. lt's too late for me.

01:23:39.696 --> 01:23:45.054
But there are a lot of cable boys
and girls who still have a chance!

01:23:45.696 --> 01:23:49.245
Don't you understand, Steven?

01:23:56.496 --> 01:24:01.251
Somebody has to kill the babysitter.

01:24:11.016 --> 01:24:18.570
This is the moment we've been
waiting for. The jury is ready ...

01:24:18.736 --> 01:24:23.014
The jury has notified the judge
that they've reached a verdict.

01:24:33.776 --> 01:24:38.088
- The moment of truth ...
- Jacob Sweet has been found ...

01:24:54.216 --> 01:24:56.491
Help.

01:25:00.576 --> 01:25:03.409
Preferred customer, my ass!

01:25:46.216 --> 01:25:51.244
Squad 51 . Man down.
Possible back injury.

01:25:53.776 --> 01:25:58.611
We'll need an lV with D-5-W.

01:25:58.776 --> 01:26:02.132
Check vital signs.

01:26:03.296 --> 01:26:06.368
Prepare to defibrillate!

01:26:15.616 --> 01:26:18.210
Wait!

01:26:23.696 --> 01:26:26.688
You two will be just fine.

01:26:26.856 --> 01:26:31.327
Take care of him, Robin.
He's good people.

01:26:31.496 --> 01:26:35.205
You never told me your real name.

01:26:35.376 --> 01:26:39.130
You still want to know my name?

01:26:43.696 --> 01:26:48.724
lt's ... Ricardo.

01:26:49.256 --> 01:26:52.566
Ricky Ricardo.

01:27:02.336 --> 01:27:05.885
l'm just messing with you.

01:27:25.216 --> 01:27:28.413
Let's go home.

01:27:33.816 --> 01:27:38.492
Hang in there, pal!
You're going to make it, buddy!

01:27:55.216 --> 01:28:00.768
- Am l really your buddy?
- Yeah, sure you are!
