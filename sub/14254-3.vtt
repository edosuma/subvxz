WEBVTT

00:09.809 --> 00:11.777
What's the matter, Harry?
You look a little pale.

00:11.845 --> 00:16.873
l volunteered for a test flight,
not a suicide mission.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.748
How can we put the new
Delta Flyer through her paces

00:19.819 --> 00:21.286
without taking a few risks?

00:22.355 --> 00:23.447
Another risk like that,

00:23.523 --> 00:26.287
and we'll have
to rebuild her all over again.

00:28.895 --> 00:31.420
There's a vessel coming up fast
off our starboard beam.

00:31.498 --> 00:33.090
Shields.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.498
Range: 50 kilometers.

00:35.602 --> 00:36.660
Ten.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.260
lt's pulling alongside.

00:39.372 --> 00:42.341
Wow, nice ship.

00:42.409 --> 00:43.205
lt's scanning us.

00:43.276 --> 00:45.403
This is Lieutenant Tom Paris.

00:45.478 --> 00:47.343
Please identify yourself.

00:47.414 --> 00:51.680
Vectored exhaust ports,
accelerated driver coils.

00:51.751 --> 00:53.946
Your vessel must be fast.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.715
Gets us where we want to go.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.017
Check your scanners.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.148
You'll see a comet

00:58.224 --> 01:00.590
on the other side
of the asteroid field.

01:00.660 --> 01:03.754
l wonder which of our ships
could get there first.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.889
Sounds like a challenge.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.900
Are you going to accept?

01:09.035 --> 01:11.663
We are not going to race her.

01:11.771 --> 01:13.636
This is a test flight, right?

01:13.706 --> 01:14.638
Yeah, but...

01:14.707 --> 01:16.937
What better way to test
the new ship than to see

01:17.077 --> 01:18.942
how it stands up
to a little competition.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.603
We're ready over here.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.341
Should l count to three?

01:23.783 --> 01:24.977
Guess not.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.830 --> 03:20.424
She's a lot more
maneuverable than we are.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.865
Not that l'm endorsing

03:21.968 --> 03:24.698
this misguided exercise,
but maybe we can even the odds.

03:26.306 --> 03:27.603
The new impulse thrusters.

03:27.674 --> 03:30.040
Ah, now, that's the spirit,
Harry.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.576
We're catching up.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.210
100 meters.

03:41.287 --> 03:42.345
Fifty.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.583
Bring the backup generators
on line

03:44.657 --> 03:46.454
and reroute power
to the thrusters.

03:59.439 --> 04:02.408
And it's the Delta Flyer
by a nose.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.410
Something's wrong with her ship.

04:05.478 --> 04:08.072
The cabin's filling up
with nyocene gas.

04:08.147 --> 04:09.808
Stand by
for emergency transport.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.591
You all right?

04:19.659 --> 04:21.250
l think so.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.056
l told you
this wasn't a good idea.

04:23.129 --> 04:26.587
Oh, does that mean
you're afraid to try again?

04:26.666 --> 04:28.224
Yeah, Harry?

04:28.334 --> 04:29.596
You afraid?

04:29.702 --> 04:32.170
No. Of course not.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.537
lt's just... your ship
is in no shape for a rematch.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.940
My power transformer overloaded.

04:38.044 --> 04:40.171
l bet we could find you
a spare back on Voyager.

04:40.246 --> 04:42.146
We were about to head back
anyway.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.307
Right, Tom?

04:43.383 --> 04:46.511
Yeah, whatever you say,
Ensign Eager.

04:51.557 --> 04:53.787
l've been looking forward
to my holodeck time all week.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.385
Why can't you borrow three hours
from someone else?

04:56.462 --> 04:58.623
Yours are the last piece
to the puzzle.

04:58.698 --> 05:04.102
Tom and l have finally managed
to get a weekend off together.

05:04.203 --> 05:06.262
l've been trading favors
with members of the crew,

05:06.372 --> 05:08.135
so that we could get
the holodeck to ourselves.

05:08.207 --> 05:09.299
A romantic getaway?

05:09.409 --> 05:10.774
Well, that's the idea, yes.

05:10.843 --> 05:14.210
Well, ordinarily l wouldn't
hesitate to oblige.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.611
But l've been looking forward

05:15.682 --> 05:17.377
to indulging myself
in a new hobby.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.042
Something human doctors
have been enjoying

05:19.118 --> 05:20.244
for centuries.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.252
l've already booked a tee time.

05:25.792 --> 05:28.727
Well, if your ''tee time''

05:28.795 --> 05:30.854
is more important
than our happiness--

05:30.930 --> 05:34.093
our first chance
to be alone in months...

05:34.167 --> 05:36.829
Fine.

05:36.936 --> 05:38.665
Take my three hours.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.739
Thank you.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.332
So what program
are you planning to run?

05:43.443 --> 05:45.377
Something new called Gedi Prime.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.844
l've heard of that.

05:46.913 --> 05:48.346
The vacation paradise

05:48.414 --> 05:50.814
that makes Risa look
like a tourist trap.

05:50.883 --> 05:51.815
Endless kilometers

05:51.884 --> 05:53.875
of crystalline beaches,
mood reefs,

05:53.953 --> 05:55.113
bioluminescent waterfalls...

05:55.188 --> 05:58.351
And a championship golf course,
if l'm not mistaken.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.982
Why don't l just join you?

06:00.059 --> 06:02.118
Somehow, l don't think
that would add to the mood.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.356
Don't be so sure.

06:04.430 --> 06:06.455
You haven't seen me
in a bathing suit.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.195
Could you hand me
the veridium injector?

06:16.943 --> 06:18.570
Veridium injector.

06:18.644 --> 06:20.612
Uh... let's see.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.274
The one with the long handle.

06:25.084 --> 06:26.346
Of course.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.782
Comfortable.

06:34.861 --> 06:37.159
My copilot thinks so, too.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.390
Copilot?

06:38.464 --> 06:41.661
l was on my way to meet him
when l ran into you.

06:41.768 --> 06:46.228
So, tell me more
about where you're from.

06:46.339 --> 06:51.709
lt's a small trinary system
about half a parsec from here.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.542
Three suns-- it must make
for some long days.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.881
Are you always this inquisitive?

06:59.952 --> 07:03.388
That depends
on who l'm talking to.

07:03.489 --> 07:07.823
Your new power transformer
is installed and ready to go.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.259
Thanks.

07:09.328 --> 07:11.387
And your impulse drive
is a real beauty.

07:11.464 --> 07:12.988
l designed it myself.

07:13.065 --> 07:15.260
But l couldn't help noticing

07:15.368 --> 07:18.565
your warp system
seems so... rudimentary.

07:18.671 --> 07:22.004
Warp's fine, if you like
going fast in a straight line.

07:22.074 --> 07:24.542
But, to me, that's just physics,
not flying.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.544
l guess it's a matter of taste.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.206
Anyway, for the kind of flying
l'm here for,

07:29.282 --> 07:30.544
warp is not a factor.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.813
The race course is only
two billion kilometers long.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.786
Race course?

07:35.855 --> 07:38.050
What kind of race course?

07:38.124 --> 07:40.422
The Antarian
Trans-Stellar Rally--

07:40.493 --> 07:43.690
three segments covering
2.3 billion kilometers.

07:43.763 --> 07:46.732
With obstacles ranging
from dwarf star clusters

07:46.799 --> 07:47.891
to K-class anomalies.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.899
Two-man crews,
and most importantly

07:50.002 --> 07:52.129
each ship is limited
to sublight speeds.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.432
lt, it's the ultimate test

07:53.539 --> 07:55.439
of ship design
and piloting skills.

07:55.508 --> 07:59.205
Not to mention a serious drain
on Voyager's resources.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.974
You're suggesting
we reassign 15 crewmen

08:02.048 --> 08:03.948
to ''modify'' the Delta Flyer?.

08:04.016 --> 08:06.541
The race has very
specific guidelines.

08:06.619 --> 08:09.452
All the ships have to use
enriched deuterium fuel.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.820
The Delta Flyer's not
equipped for that.

08:11.924 --> 08:14.688
lrina agreed to lend us
a fuel converter.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.523
Captain, this race

08:16.596 --> 08:18.427
is more than just
a sporting event.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.796
Until recently,
this region was a war zone.

08:20.867 --> 08:21.925
Four different species fought

08:22.034 --> 08:23.331
for nearly a century
to control it.

08:23.436 --> 08:26.405
Now, for the first time,
they're competing peacefully

08:26.472 --> 08:29.202
to commemorate the new treaty
that ended the war.

08:29.275 --> 08:32.176
This race embodies everything
the Federation values--

08:32.245 --> 08:33.472
a peaceful coexistence,

08:33.546 --> 08:35.070
free exchange of ideas.

08:35.147 --> 08:37.011
l think it's a great idea.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.677
-You do?
-You do?

08:39.751 --> 08:41.549
Absolutely.

08:41.621 --> 08:44.886
This competition is just
the sort of break we need.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.517
lt would give us a chance
to make some friends

08:47.593 --> 08:51.359
and allow the crew a little R&R.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.564
Request granted.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.226
Thank you, Captain.

08:56.335 --> 08:58.428
One thing, gentlemen.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.699
Now that we're in this race,

09:00.773 --> 09:02.138
we're in it to win.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.234
After all, Starfleet's honor
is at stake.

09:05.311 --> 09:07.040
Don't worry.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.980
lt's in good hands.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.093
A little tip, Doc.

09:30.202 --> 09:34.263
This game was not meant
to be played indoors.

09:34.373 --> 09:36.432
Here to rub salt in the wound?

09:36.542 --> 09:37.873
l beg your pardon?

09:38.010 --> 09:41.741
l planned to be putting
the greens at St. Andrews.

09:41.814 --> 09:45.147
lnstead... l'm putting
into beakers in Sick Bay,

09:45.217 --> 09:46.184
thanks to you.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.184
Me?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.242
Oh, don't be coy.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.754
l've already approved
your time off.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.450
The Captain's told you
about the race already?

09:52.525 --> 09:54.254
What race?

09:54.327 --> 09:56.625
l was referring
to your romantic getaway.

09:58.464 --> 09:59.556
Oh, no.

09:59.632 --> 10:02.624
Don't tell me you forgot.

10:02.702 --> 10:03.634
Uh, do me a favor, Doc.

10:03.703 --> 10:04.761
Keep a lock on my bio-signs.

10:04.870 --> 10:05.802
What for?

10:05.871 --> 10:07.566
Because in about five minutes,

10:07.673 --> 10:10.642
there may be a medical emergency
in Engineering.

10:11.811 --> 10:15.338
Hmm. Maybe l can get
that tee time back.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.049
Hi.

10:27.259 --> 10:28.954
You're early.

10:35.835 --> 10:36.961
You packed?

10:37.103 --> 10:39.196
Not yet.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.468
Um... actually...

10:42.541 --> 10:44.270
there might be a little problem.

10:44.343 --> 10:45.708
Problem?

10:47.880 --> 10:50.212
l have a chance
to pilot the Flyer in a race--

10:50.282 --> 10:52.477
uh, a really unique race--

10:52.551 --> 10:55.520
and the Captain thinks
it's a great idea...

10:55.588 --> 10:59.752
So, l guess l got so excited
that l forgot about our plans.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.451
But l-l don't have to do it.

11:02.528 --> 11:04.462
The Captain would understand.

11:04.530 --> 11:05.656
lt's all right.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.392
No, no,
l should have remembered.

11:07.466 --> 11:10.060
lt's just that this seemed like
such an amazing opportunity.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.136
Pilots from all over...

11:11.237 --> 11:12.932
l said it's okay.

11:14.907 --> 11:16.238
Really?

11:16.308 --> 11:19.209
The holodeck
will always be here.

11:19.278 --> 11:20.745
This race won't.

11:24.650 --> 11:27.175
l do not deserve you.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.517
You're right about that.

11:31.223 --> 11:34.818
So, um, we'll plan this vacation
for another time.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.122
Sure.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.095
l-l'm going
to make this up to you.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.654
l promise.

11:50.242 --> 11:51.766
Late night?

11:55.815 --> 11:57.214
Can l get you anything?

11:57.283 --> 11:58.773
No, thanks.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.817
Are you okay?

12:03.889 --> 12:05.652
Oh, my feet. Ah.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.625
l haven't had a chance
to sit down all day.

12:07.693 --> 12:09.752
lf you're thinking
of cheering me up,

12:09.829 --> 12:11.353
don't bother.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.990
Hmm. Who, me? Never.

12:14.066 --> 12:14.998
And by the way,

12:15.101 --> 12:16.864
you can have
your holodeck time back.

12:16.969 --> 12:19.437
What about your weekend
with Tom?

12:19.538 --> 12:21.972
He just canceled it.

12:23.542 --> 12:26.807
Does he have any idea
how much planning it took?

12:26.879 --> 12:28.506
No.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.072
And you're not going
to tell him, either.

12:32.852 --> 12:35.685
He just entered this big race,

12:35.755 --> 12:38.349
and he's really excited, and...

12:38.424 --> 12:40.790
l don't want
to spoil it for him.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.953
Well, l'm sure if you tell him

12:43.028 --> 12:45.758
how important
this weekend was to you,

12:45.831 --> 12:47.059
he'll reconsider.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.124
Probably.

12:49.235 --> 12:53.228
But he should be able
to do what makes him happy.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.605
What about what makes you happy?

12:56.675 --> 12:59.872
lt's time l faced facts,
Neelix.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.974
Tom and l just don't
belong together.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.883
Then you're not in love
with him anymore?

13:09.021 --> 13:11.148
l didn't say that.

13:12.525 --> 13:16.461
But, B'Elanna, if you still
love each other...

13:16.529 --> 13:18.520
Maybe that isn't enough.

13:18.597 --> 13:20.997
Call me a hopeless romantic,

13:21.066 --> 13:23.057
but l still think it is.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.529
Yeah, well,
there's a Klingon phrase

13:27.640 --> 13:31.201
that my grandmother
used to use-- mok'tah.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.939
lt means ''bad match.''

13:35.681 --> 13:38.844
That's what Tom and l are.

13:38.918 --> 13:41.409
l just hate
that it's taken me three years

13:41.487 --> 13:43.387
to realize it.

13:45.391 --> 13:48.053
lf you're really such a mok'tah,

13:48.127 --> 13:50.186
it must have been
an awful three years.

13:50.262 --> 13:52.662
No.

13:52.731 --> 13:55.199
Tom is a great guy.

13:55.301 --> 13:58.202
We've had a lot of fun together.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.602
And that seems to be
enough for him.

14:02.074 --> 14:05.009
But not for me.

14:06.278 --> 14:08.803
Why aren't you saying
all this to Tom?

14:08.881 --> 14:10.473
l plan to.

14:10.549 --> 14:12.244
After the race.

14:12.318 --> 14:17.312
By which time, he'll already
have disappointed you again.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.590
l may not know as much
about Klingon tradition

14:22.661 --> 14:24.026
as your grandmother,

14:24.096 --> 14:26.656
but somehow,
keeping Tom in the dark

14:26.732 --> 14:28.825
doesn't seem very honorable.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.471
My feet are feeling better.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.304
l should go back to work.

14:43.782 --> 14:48.242
Captain's Log,
Stardate 54058.6.

14:48.320 --> 14:51.084
Our request to enter
the Delta Flyer into the rally

14:51.156 --> 14:52.453
has been accepted.

14:52.524 --> 14:55.960
l'm meeting with the race
coordinator, Ambassador O'Zaal,

14:56.061 --> 14:57.551
to work out the details.

14:57.630 --> 14:58.892
We have teams
that have traveled

14:58.964 --> 14:59.896
quite a distance, Captain,

14:59.965 --> 15:01.523
but none from as far
as the Alpha Quadrant.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.534
We're always willing to go
that extra light-year

15:03.602 --> 15:05.035
for a good cause.

15:05.104 --> 15:08.437
Well, your, uh,
entrance petition

15:08.507 --> 15:09.769
seems to be in order.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.833
The Delta Flyer
meets our guidelines.

15:12.011 --> 15:14.070
Now all you have to do is win.

15:14.146 --> 15:15.272
Something tells me

15:15.347 --> 15:17.315
the other teams aren't going
to make that too easy.

15:17.383 --> 15:18.680
Bridge to the Captain.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.082
Go ahead, Commander.

15:20.152 --> 15:21.881
There is
an incoming transmission

15:21.954 --> 15:22.978
for the Ambassador.

15:23.055 --> 15:24.317
Route it here.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.062
l asked not to be disturbed.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.866
l'm sorry, but the Aksani
are threatening to withdraw

15:40.973 --> 15:43.806
unless they're allowed to host
the post-race ceremony.

15:43.876 --> 15:44.865
Did you explain that

15:44.977 --> 15:46.672
we've already promised
that to the Chessu?

15:46.745 --> 15:49.612
Yes. They said
that was... unacceptable.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.412
Arrange for another meeting.

15:53.485 --> 15:56.283
l'll have to find
some way of appeasing them.

15:58.157 --> 16:00.421
Well, l hope the race
you just entered

16:00.492 --> 16:02.255
doesn't end before it begins.

16:02.328 --> 16:03.454
lt's that serious?

16:03.529 --> 16:05.326
The peace is still very fragile.

16:05.397 --> 16:07.922
Every decision l make,
no matter how trivial,

16:08.033 --> 16:09.557
is looked upon as symbolic.

16:09.668 --> 16:11.636
So, every time
you make a concession

16:11.737 --> 16:12.829
to one participant...

16:12.972 --> 16:14.337
Another is offended, yes.

16:14.406 --> 16:15.395
Maybe we can help.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.475
That would be wonderful,
but how?

16:17.576 --> 16:19.544
By providing neutral ground

16:19.611 --> 16:22.375
for the pre and post-race
activities.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.882
Since we've never taken
sides in your conflict,

16:24.984 --> 16:27.475
you couldn't be accused
of showing favoritism.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.282
lf your racing skills
are as sharp

16:29.355 --> 16:30.879
as your diplomatic instincts,

16:30.956 --> 16:32.821
the other teams
won't have a chance.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.170
There's someone
to watch out for.

16:49.241 --> 16:50.435
What's his story?

16:50.509 --> 16:51.806
His name is Assan.

16:51.877 --> 16:54.641
He was a fighter pilot--

16:54.713 --> 16:56.476
one of the most ruthless.

16:59.651 --> 17:01.141
Uh, where you going?

17:01.253 --> 17:03.813
A little personal
reconnaissance.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.221
We are the hosts.

17:09.127 --> 17:10.459
Lieutenant Tom Paris.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.497
Welcome aboard.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.829
Could l get you something?

17:17.002 --> 17:18.765
A drink?
Something to eat?

17:18.871 --> 17:20.236
Tour of the ship?

17:20.305 --> 17:22.603
Were you assigned to serve me?

17:22.674 --> 17:25.108
Um, not exactly.

17:25.176 --> 17:27.542
Are we friends?

17:27.613 --> 17:29.137
l guess not.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.307
Then you must be one
of those pilots

17:31.383 --> 17:33.749
who believes in the
fellowship of combat.

17:35.687 --> 17:37.086
Correct me if l'm wrong,

17:37.156 --> 17:40.489
but l thought this was
a friendly race, not a battle.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.720
lf that's what you believe,

17:42.795 --> 17:44.922
then you've already lost.

17:46.131 --> 17:50.397
Well... nice chatting with you.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.107
Learn anything?

17:56.208 --> 17:58.802
Yeah, l should leave
the hosting to Neelix.

17:58.877 --> 17:59.935
Joxom.

18:00.012 --> 18:00.979
Who?

18:01.046 --> 18:02.604
My copilot.

18:02.681 --> 18:05.047
lrina. Hi.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.812
Well. Looks like
they're good friends.

18:06.885 --> 18:07.909
They're teammates.

18:07.986 --> 18:08.918
Mm.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.978
Close...

18:11.056 --> 18:13.251
personal teammates.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.953
Oh, it was nice while it lasted.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.620
Come on.

18:20.899 --> 18:22.958
Seven, l need you
to run a diagnostic

18:23.068 --> 18:24.592
on the lateral sensor array.

18:24.703 --> 18:27.001
As soon as l'm finished.

18:27.072 --> 18:28.801
With what?

18:28.874 --> 18:30.341
Plotting the most
efficient course

18:30.409 --> 18:32.343
for the first segment
of the rally.

18:32.411 --> 18:35.744
Seems like the entire crew
has come down with race fever.

18:35.814 --> 18:38.248
Perhaps you could
persuade the Doctor

18:38.317 --> 18:39.784
to develop a vaccine.

18:41.420 --> 18:44.253
l'm surprised you're
putting time into this.

18:44.323 --> 18:47.690
lnitially, l did find
the activity irrelevant,

18:47.759 --> 18:49.522
but then l realized
that it's important

18:49.595 --> 18:50.755
for the crew's morale

18:50.829 --> 18:52.888
and for my relationship
with Lieutenant Paris.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.833
Your relationship
with Lieutenant Paris?

18:56.935 --> 18:59.460
l was speaking professionally.

18:59.571 --> 19:02.563
l often work with him
on navigational problems.

19:02.674 --> 19:05.302
He can be an erratic individual.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.504
But he's also
a very competent officer

19:07.579 --> 19:09.206
and clearly a skilled pilot.

19:09.281 --> 19:12.717
lt's the erratic individual
that takes getting used to.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.809
No doubt.

19:14.887 --> 19:18.152
But l've learned that if
l embrace some of his interests,

19:18.223 --> 19:19.815
support him
in his personal goals,

19:19.925 --> 19:22.655
we're able to function
more efficiently as crewmates.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.198
Harry, where have you been?

19:37.309 --> 19:38.640
Say Qapla'.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.976
lt means success.

19:43.048 --> 19:44.845
l just wanted
to capture the moment,

19:44.917 --> 19:47.351
not to mention that cute
bewildered expression.

19:47.419 --> 19:50.115
What are you doing
in that flight suit?

19:50.189 --> 19:51.486
There's been a change of plans.

19:51.557 --> 19:52.922
l'm your new copilot.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.425
Look, l don't have time
for practical jokes.

19:56.495 --> 19:57.723
Neither do l.

19:57.796 --> 19:59.787
Ready to bring
that impulse drive on line?

19:59.865 --> 20:00.889
B'Elanna...

20:00.966 --> 20:03.799
Okay, l was upset
that you canceled our weekend,

20:03.902 --> 20:04.994
but then l realized--

20:05.103 --> 20:07.128
why should we spend
this time apart

20:07.239 --> 20:10.902
when we can be together
doing something you like?

20:10.976 --> 20:13.410
What about Harry?

20:13.478 --> 20:17.539
l assigned him to a level-5
diagnostic in Engineering.

20:17.616 --> 20:18.947
Oh, that's terrible.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.484
l'm just kidding.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.419
l told him how hard it was
for us to get time together,

20:23.488 --> 20:24.477
and he understood.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.183
Anyway, the way l see it,

20:26.258 --> 20:29.489
you're trading an Ensign
for a Chief Engineer.

20:31.029 --> 20:33.361
Well, you don't have
to convince me.

20:33.432 --> 20:36.833
l couldn't ask
for a better copilot.

20:38.103 --> 20:40.663
Now just remember,
we're not on vacation.

20:40.772 --> 20:41.966
The point is to win.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.837
And you know how much
l hate to lose.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.469
Thrusters on line.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.879
Opening Shuttle Bay doors.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.283
The racers are moving
into position.

20:59.157 --> 21:00.590
Ambassador.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.060
Welcome to the first running

21:04.129 --> 21:06.529
of the Antarian
Trans-Stellar Rally.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.828
This moment
marks a hopeful point

21:08.900 --> 21:11.460
in our shared history--
a chance to put aside

21:11.570 --> 21:13.868
old animosities,
and come together

21:13.939 --> 21:16.669
in a spirit of peace
and friendly competition.

21:16.742 --> 21:18.369
Good luck to all of you.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.707
Prepare for the starting signal.

21:26.418 --> 21:28.716
Captain, the honor is yours.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.118
Mr. Tuvok.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.222
Fire.

21:59.618 --> 22:02.212
We passed two more ships,
three still ahead of us.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.618
How's my impulse engine?

22:03.655 --> 22:06.681
Hot, but stable, thanks
to the new fuel converter.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.221
That was the Number 8 ship.

22:10.295 --> 22:11.819
Assan.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.888
Whoever it is just grazed
our shields.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.432
Port thrusters are off-line.

22:15.534 --> 22:16.501
Compensating.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.899
Well, that was an old trick.

22:19.071 --> 22:22.507
Back at the Academy
we used to call that ''scraping.''

22:22.607 --> 22:25.542
Well, Assan just almost
scraped us out of the race.

22:25.610 --> 22:26.872
How are we doing on time?

22:26.945 --> 22:28.708
20 seconds to the third marker.

22:28.780 --> 22:31.943
Assan's already rounding it,
thanks to his little tactic.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.951
Well, it's a long race.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.248
We'll catch him.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.252
How's our team doing?

22:40.325 --> 22:42.623
l announced the
Delta Flyer's progress

22:42.694 --> 22:45.686
over the com 1 1 minutes ago.

22:45.764 --> 22:51.225
ln a race like this,
1 1 minutes can be an eternity!

22:51.303 --> 22:53.737
The Delta Flyer is
in fourth position,

22:53.805 --> 22:56.103
having completed
62 percent of the course.

22:56.174 --> 22:57.835
The Aksani vessel is
in third position

22:57.909 --> 23:00.139
having completed
68 percent of the course.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.476
You don't make it sound
very exciting.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.845
l'm relaying
the relevant information.

23:04.916 --> 23:06.008
lt's all in the delivery.

23:06.084 --> 23:07.051
Do you mind?

23:08.787 --> 23:10.618
Attention, all hands.

23:10.689 --> 23:12.748
Stand by for a race update!

23:12.824 --> 23:15.816
With only 58 million kilometers
left in the first segment,

23:15.894 --> 23:17.828
the Aksani, lmhotep
and Terrellian ships

23:17.896 --> 23:19.227
are still battling for the lead.

23:19.297 --> 23:22.164
Wait. The Number 8 ship
just cut off the Number 3

23:22.267 --> 23:23.256
in the Darla system.

23:23.368 --> 23:24.835
Now 3's changing course.

23:24.936 --> 23:26.198
Using the gravity
from a gas giant

23:26.304 --> 23:28.272
to boost its speed, it's
making up for lost ground!

23:28.340 --> 23:29.705
Sounds like quite a race.

23:29.775 --> 23:33.472
Apparently, it's all
in the delivery.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.315
So much for the Aksani.

23:38.383 --> 23:41.477
Now it's just down
to lrina and Assan.

23:41.553 --> 23:42.542
ln a few minutes,

23:42.621 --> 23:44.612
they'll just be echoes
in our aft scanners.

23:45.724 --> 23:47.749
Well, we still got
the Mobius lnversion coming up.

23:47.826 --> 23:48.918
The what?

23:48.994 --> 23:51.462
Tell me you read
the course manual.

23:51.530 --> 23:55.830
l skimmed it... more or less.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.368
Oh, great.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.201
So, what exactly is
this Mobius whatever?

24:01.273 --> 24:02.638
Take a look.

24:02.707 --> 24:06.973
Covers the entire last third
of the course.

24:07.045 --> 24:10.640
Level-6 subspace distortions,
gravimetric shears.

24:10.715 --> 24:13.275
Just think of it
as a little wormhole

24:13.351 --> 24:14.818
with a big attitude.

24:16.822 --> 24:19.882
The Terrellian and lmhotep ships
are still in the lead;

24:20.025 --> 24:21.890
the Delta Flyer trailing
by a few seconds.

24:22.027 --> 24:24.689
Meanwhile, the two Chessu ships
are continuing to advance

24:24.763 --> 24:26.390
claiming fourth
and fifth position.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.591
My weekly security report.

24:27.666 --> 24:28.598
l'll read it later.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.658
There are a few matters
we should discuss.

24:30.735 --> 24:31.827
She said later, Tuvok.

24:31.937 --> 24:32.904
Something's wrong.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.303
They're disappearing.

24:35.373 --> 24:36.897
Radiation
from the Mobius lnversion

24:37.008 --> 24:38.134
is blocking our sensors.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.643
How will we track
their progress?

24:39.711 --> 24:41.508
We can't.
Not until they emerge

24:41.580 --> 24:43.639
from the other side
of the anomaly.

24:43.715 --> 24:45.808
Want to talk about
that report now, Tuvok?

24:45.884 --> 24:48.648
Later, if that's permissible.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.347
50 meters.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.083
Forty.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.250
We can get through.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.793
No, they're too close
to each other.

24:55.861 --> 24:57.385
l'm reversing
our deflector polarity.

24:57.462 --> 24:58.690
lt'll repel their shields.

24:58.763 --> 25:00.890
Why wait for an opening
when you can make one?

25:00.999 --> 25:01.931
No, it's too risky.

25:02.033 --> 25:03.000
Too risky?

25:03.101 --> 25:05.535
That doesn't sound
like the Tom Paris l know.

25:05.604 --> 25:06.468
What are you doing?

25:06.538 --> 25:07.698
Deploying auxiliary thrusters.

25:07.806 --> 25:10.036
We'll need the extra maneuvering
power to get through the gap.

25:10.108 --> 25:11.040
B'Elanna...

25:11.109 --> 25:12.406
Just steer the ship.

25:22.487 --> 25:25.285
lt's them. lt's the Delta Flyer.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.881
They're in the lead!

25:27.025 --> 25:28.754
They're pulling away!

25:28.827 --> 25:30.158
We did it!

25:30.228 --> 25:31.388
You should have waited.

25:31.463 --> 25:32.828
l saw a chance and l too...

25:32.898 --> 25:33.830
l'm the pilot.

25:33.899 --> 25:35.833
That means l do the flying.

25:35.901 --> 25:38.563
Attention all racers.
There's been an accident.

25:38.670 --> 25:41.639
Stay in order
and shut down your engines.

25:57.522 --> 25:58.454
Report.

25:58.523 --> 25:59.956
His condition's stabilizing.

26:00.025 --> 26:00.957
l should be able to start

26:00.992 --> 26:02.516
dermal regeneration
in a few hours.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.461
This was Assan's fault.

26:04.529 --> 26:05.461
Why?

26:05.530 --> 26:07.225
He collided with me
so many times

26:07.299 --> 26:08.994
my shield generator overloaded.

26:09.100 --> 26:10.499
Joxom's console exploded.

26:10.602 --> 26:12.035
He's lucky he's alive.

26:14.673 --> 26:17.141
lf l'm guilty of anything,
it's of coming in second,

26:17.242 --> 26:19.870
a situation l'll remedy
in the next leg.

26:19.978 --> 26:22.879
You're doing a poor job
of defending yourself.

26:22.948 --> 26:25.109
We may have had
something to do with this, too.

26:25.183 --> 26:28.243
We grazed both of their shields
while in the anomaly.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.584
lntentionally?

26:30.655 --> 26:31.986
lt was a tight course.

26:32.057 --> 26:34.491
Everyone was flying
very aggressively.

26:34.559 --> 26:36.993
Your team is not responsible,
Captain.

26:37.062 --> 26:38.893
My generators were
already overloading

26:38.964 --> 26:40.090
when they made contact.

26:40.165 --> 26:42.895
Perhaps none of you
is to blame.

26:43.034 --> 26:45.696
l found this interfaced

26:45.804 --> 26:48.102
with her ship's
shield generator.

26:48.173 --> 26:51.165
l ran an analysis.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.903
lt's a phase inverter,

26:52.978 --> 26:55.538
designed to cause
a system overload.

26:55.614 --> 26:56.876
Well, it's hard to believe

26:56.948 --> 26:59.610
someone would go this far
just to knock a competitor

26:59.684 --> 27:00.981
out of the race.

27:01.086 --> 27:02.144
This may be more

27:02.187 --> 27:04.951
than a simple case
of cheating, Captain.

27:05.023 --> 27:09.119
l think someone's trying
to end the peace.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.733
Maybe l'm missing something,

27:16.835 --> 27:19.326
but we're talking
about a single act of sabotage.

27:19.437 --> 27:21.268
How does that threaten
your treaty?

27:21.339 --> 27:22.966
By itself, it wouldn't.

27:23.041 --> 27:25.441
But we've received
several threats

27:25.510 --> 27:27.307
of a more serious nature.

27:27.379 --> 27:28.346
From whom?

27:28.413 --> 27:30.142
Groups opposed to the alliance--

27:30.215 --> 27:34.174
arms dealers, isolationists,
political extremists.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.652
Up until now l wasn't sure
how seriously to take them.

27:36.721 --> 27:38.348
Clearly, they pose
a security threat.

27:38.423 --> 27:39.412
Yes, yes.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.856
We've done everything
we could

27:40.925 --> 27:41.892
to protect the racers,

27:42.027 --> 27:43.324
but that may not be enough.

27:45.463 --> 27:48.364
l don't want to risk
any more lives.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.526
We should cancel the race

27:50.635 --> 27:51.602
or at least postpone it,

27:51.670 --> 27:53.331
until we can guarantee
everyone's safety.

27:53.438 --> 27:55.906
No. lf we stop now,

27:56.041 --> 27:58.009
we'll be letting
these extremists win.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.475
She's right.

28:03.615 --> 28:04.775
Very well, then.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.544
lf that's the consensus,

28:06.618 --> 28:09.178
we'll resume tomorrow
as scheduled.

28:09.254 --> 28:10.380
Of course, Captain,

28:10.455 --> 28:13.083
if you decide to withdraw,
we'd understand.

28:13.158 --> 28:16.650
Well, the last time l checked,
l believe we were winning.

28:23.601 --> 28:24.568
There you are.

28:24.669 --> 28:27.160
Congratulations
on taking the lead.

28:27.272 --> 28:28.204
Thanks.

28:28.273 --> 28:30.104
Of course, uh, you're
not going to win.

28:30.175 --> 28:31.107
Why is that?

28:31.176 --> 28:32.268
Because we are.

28:32.343 --> 28:34.402
You're looking
at your new copilot.

28:34.479 --> 28:36.879
l checked with one
of the race officials.

28:36.981 --> 28:38.175
lt's perfectly legal

28:38.249 --> 28:42.413
and it's a chance for both of us
to get back in the race.

28:42.487 --> 28:45.217
l appreciate the gesture,
but my ship's damaged.

28:45.290 --> 28:46.723
You don't know our Harry.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.725
Once we sets his mind
on something...

28:48.793 --> 28:50.317
He'll not only fix
your ship,

28:50.395 --> 28:51.885
he'll polish the bulkheads.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.191
How can you turn me down?

28:53.264 --> 28:56.165
Apparently, l can't.

29:02.107 --> 29:04.905
Come on, you can say it.

29:04.976 --> 29:06.671
lt's embarrassing.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.542
l just want to make sure we're
clear on what we're doing.

29:10.882 --> 29:14.682
''Right at the light,
then readjust my sight.''

29:14.753 --> 29:16.687
Meaning?

29:16.755 --> 29:19.087
Come about 86 degrees
at the red giant

29:19.157 --> 29:20.624
then recalibrate sensors

29:20.692 --> 29:23.183
to compensate
for photonic interference.

29:23.261 --> 29:24.728
Great. Next?

29:24.796 --> 29:26.457
Do l really have to spend
my morning

29:26.531 --> 29:27.691
reciting nursery rhymes?

29:27.766 --> 29:29.825
lt got me through the Academy.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.526
You were expelled.

29:35.039 --> 29:37.007
Okay, repeat after me.

29:37.108 --> 29:38.234
''l am not the pilot.

29:38.309 --> 29:40.470
l will not attempt
to fly this ship.''

29:40.545 --> 29:43.070
That one doesn't even rhyme.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.082
Anyone home?

29:46.151 --> 29:48.381
Well, if it isn't
our competition.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.579
Here to spy on us?

29:49.654 --> 29:52.589
l just stopped by to borrow
a hyperspanner.

29:52.657 --> 29:54.488
Looks like you didn't
get much sleep.

29:54.559 --> 29:56.584
lrina and l were up all night.

29:56.661 --> 29:58.424
Oh, really?

29:58.496 --> 29:59.588
Making repairs.

29:59.664 --> 30:00.596
Uh-huh.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.656
To be honest, l can't remember

30:02.734 --> 30:04.895
the last time
l had so much fun.

30:05.036 --> 30:06.469
She's funny, smart,

30:06.538 --> 30:09.132
we get along without trying.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.571
l'm going to ask her
if she wants

30:10.642 --> 30:12.542
to spend some time
on Voyager after the race.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.703
What about Joxom?

30:14.779 --> 30:17.179
Turns out
they're just teammates.

30:17.248 --> 30:19.580
l know what you're going to say.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.709
No, no.

30:20.785 --> 30:23.049
Actually, l was just
going to congratulate you.

30:23.121 --> 30:24.952
l mean, she's not a Borg,
she's not a hologram

30:25.056 --> 30:27.524
and she's not dead.

30:27.592 --> 30:29.287
Looks like you might have
finally found yourself

30:29.360 --> 30:30.292
the perfect woman.

30:30.361 --> 30:32.226
All teams report to your ships.

30:32.297 --> 30:34.128
The race will resume
in 30 minutes.

30:34.199 --> 30:37.191
See you on the course.

30:49.581 --> 30:50.912
Attention all hands.

30:50.982 --> 30:53.280
Stand by
for another race update.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.148
After fighting off
a formidable challenge

30:55.220 --> 30:57.245
from the Terrellian team,

30:57.322 --> 30:59.449
the Delta Flyer has managed
to hold onto its lead

30:59.524 --> 31:01.151
going into the third
and final segment.

31:07.732 --> 31:10.064
Approaching the pulsars.

31:10.168 --> 31:12.602
''Straight through the gate.''

31:12.670 --> 31:14.604
''Then remodulate.''

31:14.672 --> 31:17.732
Harry sure had that glow,
didn't he?

31:17.842 --> 31:18.866
What glow?

31:18.977 --> 31:20.239
You know,

31:20.311 --> 31:22.506
that look you get
when you first meet someone.

31:22.580 --> 31:25.276
Yeah. His cheeks were
a little redder than usual.

31:25.350 --> 31:28.342
We're through the pulsars.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.785
Harry and lrina
are right behind us.

31:30.855 --> 31:32.948
You can ease up
off the thrusters now.

31:33.024 --> 31:36.289
l want to conserve some fuel
for the final leg.

31:36.361 --> 31:38.090
lf circumstances were right,

31:38.162 --> 31:40.653
they might even have
a future together.

31:40.732 --> 31:41.858
What?

31:41.933 --> 31:44.128
Harry and lrina.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.224
Oh, they just met.

31:45.336 --> 31:47.964
lt's a little early
to be planning a wedding.

31:48.106 --> 31:51.200
No, l just meant that some
people just fit together

31:51.309 --> 31:53.004
without having to work at it.

31:53.111 --> 31:56.012
And other people,
no matter how much they try...

31:56.147 --> 31:58.741
Are we talking about them or us?

31:58.816 --> 31:59.976
What?

32:01.986 --> 32:03.317
No, l didn't mean...

32:03.388 --> 32:06.118
lf something's bothering you,
let's talk about it.

32:08.126 --> 32:10.094
We should concentrate
on the race.

32:16.067 --> 32:17.466
Well, maybe Harry and lrina

32:17.568 --> 32:19.365
aren't such a great team
after all.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.938
They're falling behind.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.338
l'm reading malfunctions
in the EPS relays,

32:24.409 --> 32:26.673
but we double-checked
all of them last night.

32:26.744 --> 32:28.075
We must have missed something.

32:28.146 --> 32:30.239
At this rate, we're going
to be out of the race

32:30.315 --> 32:31.612
in a couple of minutes.

32:31.683 --> 32:35.517
l think l can reroute power
through the impulse manifold.

32:35.586 --> 32:36.518
No.

32:36.587 --> 32:38.851
Why not?

32:38.923 --> 32:41.118
lt could damage
the reactor coils.

32:41.192 --> 32:42.955
What do the reactor coils
have to do

32:43.094 --> 32:44.527
with the impulse manifolds?

32:44.595 --> 32:46.961
These systems are different
than what you're used to.

32:47.065 --> 32:50.330
You do want to win, don't you?

32:51.436 --> 32:53.404
Of course l do.

32:53.504 --> 32:57.463
lt just seems like every time
l make a suggestion,

32:57.575 --> 33:00.009
you find a reason to reject it.

33:00.078 --> 33:03.047
l'm more familiar
with my ship than you are.

33:04.182 --> 33:05.171
Now what?

33:05.249 --> 33:07.683
l think it's the injector ports.

33:07.752 --> 33:11.119
No, it's an overload
in my console.

33:15.393 --> 33:18.624
That's the second time
your copilot's console exploded.

33:18.696 --> 33:20.323
Quite a coincidence.

33:21.632 --> 33:23.691
l'm sorry, Harry.

33:23.801 --> 33:25.496
l really am.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.476
You sabotaged your own ship--

33:33.544 --> 33:35.637
twice.

33:35.713 --> 33:39.740
Why are you trying so hard
to get out of this race?

33:51.396 --> 33:53.125
What the hell is going on?

33:54.365 --> 33:55.798
Sit down and hold still!

34:02.273 --> 34:03.604
All right.

34:03.674 --> 34:05.767
lf you won't talk to me,

34:05.843 --> 34:08.607
maybe you'll talk
to Antarian Security.

34:11.649 --> 34:13.708
You disabled the com system.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.447
We'll just wait.

34:16.521 --> 34:19.284
Someone will come along
eventually.

34:24.829 --> 34:26.728
We're past the last marker.

34:26.797 --> 34:28.766
Time to deploy the thrusters?

34:28.833 --> 34:30.164
Whatever you say.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.929
What happened
to ''l'm the pilot''?

34:34.038 --> 34:36.871
That really bothered you,
didn't it?

34:36.940 --> 34:37.908
lt's why you think

34:38.042 --> 34:40.476
we don't fit together
as well as Harry and lrina?

34:40.545 --> 34:41.806
Could we talk about this later?

34:41.879 --> 34:43.141
Assan is gaining on us.

34:43.214 --> 34:45.512
Well, then, l guess you'd better
deploy the thrusters.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.710
Thrusters deployed.

34:49.654 --> 34:52.121
This isn't about the race
anymore, is it?

34:52.190 --> 34:53.657
You tell me.

35:00.665 --> 35:02.360
lf we're going to just sit here,

35:02.433 --> 35:04.333
we might as well see
who's winning.

35:04.435 --> 35:07.370
You're not exactly in a position
to be making requests.

35:07.438 --> 35:11.534
Admit it, Harry--
you're curious, too.

35:18.349 --> 35:20.613
The Delta Flyer is still
in the lead.

35:20.685 --> 35:24.177
Good for them.

35:26.724 --> 35:29.420
l thought that if we could
do this one thing together,

35:29.494 --> 35:31.018
something that you cared about,

35:31.095 --> 35:32.892
that it might help
our relationship.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.625
l didn't know it needed help.

35:34.699 --> 35:37.133
Well, that's part
of the problem.

35:37.235 --> 35:39.499
What's the rest?

35:39.604 --> 35:40.901
You know the rest.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.875
So we scrape shields
occasionally.

35:45.943 --> 35:47.877
lt keeps things interesting.

35:47.945 --> 35:50.175
Maybe interesting
isn't enough for me.

35:54.185 --> 35:55.675
What are you doing?

35:55.753 --> 35:57.380
They're stopping.

35:57.455 --> 35:59.286
They're dead in the water.

35:59.357 --> 36:00.187
Ah-ah.

36:03.594 --> 36:05.528
How far from the finish line?

36:05.596 --> 36:07.894
Less than a million kilometers.

36:11.569 --> 36:13.264
That was Assan!

36:13.371 --> 36:15.202
Why are we just sitting here?

36:15.273 --> 36:16.672
lf we've got a problem,

36:16.741 --> 36:19.869
we're going to resolve it
right here, right now.

36:19.977 --> 36:21.877
You've done everything possible
to take yourself

36:21.979 --> 36:24.413
out of the race,
and now you seem worried

36:24.482 --> 36:26.973
that the Delta Flyer
won't reach the finish line.

36:30.555 --> 36:31.886
l'm counting more than a dozen

36:32.023 --> 36:35.390
ships there--
spectators, officials...

36:35.459 --> 36:38.519
All congregated
in the name of peace.

36:38.596 --> 36:40.154
Touching, isn't it?

36:40.231 --> 36:42.893
You've planned
some sort of attack.

36:43.034 --> 36:46.470
There are hundreds of
innocent people there.

36:46.537 --> 36:48.095
How can you do that?

36:49.373 --> 36:53.139
Not everyone is as comfortable
mixing with other species

36:53.211 --> 36:54.371
as you are, Harry.

36:54.445 --> 36:58.176
Some of us believe it was better
when we were separate.

36:58.249 --> 36:59.807
Hey, l never asked you
to give up this race,

36:59.884 --> 37:01.408
or anything else
that you care about.

37:01.519 --> 37:03.282
l never asked you
to stop being yourself.

37:03.321 --> 37:04.811
The only self that l want to be

37:04.922 --> 37:06.787
is the guy
that you're in love with.

37:06.857 --> 37:11.624
Wow... l didn't know
you felt that way.

37:11.696 --> 37:13.459
How can you say that?

37:15.733 --> 37:18.702
Well, you always seem
to have other priorities.

37:18.769 --> 37:22.102
l'm showing you my priorities
right now.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.505
The Delta Flyer wouldn't even be
in this race

37:24.575 --> 37:26.236
if you hadn't told us about it.

37:26.310 --> 37:30.337
You gave us the fuel converter
so we could qualify.

37:30.414 --> 37:32.348
The fuel converter.

37:32.416 --> 37:33.974
That's why you're so concerned

37:34.051 --> 37:37.214
about Tom and B'Elanna's
crossing the finish line.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.222
What'd you do to it?

37:39.290 --> 37:40.985
Rig it to explode?

37:48.733 --> 37:51.600
How come you never talked
to me about this before?

37:51.702 --> 37:56.401
Well, you've got that tough
Klingon exterior, and...

37:56.474 --> 37:59.409
l didn't think you liked
the mushy stuff.

37:59.477 --> 38:02.344
Do l look that tough right now?

38:02.446 --> 38:07.383
Well, does that mean you're in
the mood for some mushy stuff?

38:07.418 --> 38:09.511
Maybe.

38:09.587 --> 38:12.681
Exactly what kind of mush
are we talking about?

38:12.757 --> 38:15.692
You tell me.

38:15.760 --> 38:19.059
Well, there's, um...

38:23.200 --> 38:25.259
kissy stuff.

38:25.369 --> 38:29.032
That was nice.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.700
And there's the...

38:31.809 --> 38:35.575
''you're the most important
person in the world to me.''

38:35.646 --> 38:37.876
l like that one, too.

38:37.982 --> 38:42.885
And there's
the ''happily ever after.''

38:42.987 --> 38:45.046
How does that one work?

38:46.657 --> 38:51.219
Well, traditionally,
it requires a proposal...

38:59.670 --> 39:03.003
We're being scanned by some kind
of modulating pulse.

39:03.107 --> 39:04.540
lt's from lrina's ship.

39:04.575 --> 39:06.941
They must be wondering
why we stopped.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.945
There's something odd
about the amplitude.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.776
Wait a minute.
Di-di-da...

39:10.848 --> 39:14.181
That's Morse code.

39:14.251 --> 39:17.345
Harry and l use it in the
Captain Proton holoprogram.

39:17.421 --> 39:18.820
What's he saying?

39:18.956 --> 39:23.950
''Fuel... converter...

39:24.028 --> 39:25.757
''rigged.

39:25.830 --> 39:26.922
Eject.''

39:26.997 --> 39:28.726
What does he mean by ''rigged''?

39:28.799 --> 39:31.791
That converter's leaking
veridium isotopes.

39:31.869 --> 39:34.429
Why didn't the computer warn us?

39:34.538 --> 39:37.268
The on-line sensors
have been tampered with.

39:37.341 --> 39:39.070
Can you contain the leak?

39:39.143 --> 39:40.735
Too late. The veridium
is already reacting

39:40.811 --> 39:41.743
with the warp plasma.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.609
That'll cause
a warp core breach.

39:43.681 --> 39:44.579
ln less than a minute.

39:44.648 --> 39:45.580
Then do what Harry said.

39:45.649 --> 39:46.479
Eject the converter.

39:46.550 --> 39:47.482
lt's too late.

39:47.551 --> 39:48.779
l have to eject the core.

39:48.853 --> 39:49.979
Here?

39:50.054 --> 39:52.284
We'll never survive the blast.

39:52.356 --> 39:56.315
Neither will anyone else
within a million kilometers.

39:57.895 --> 39:59.328
They're moving again.

40:02.299 --> 40:05.791
Away... from the finish line.

40:12.143 --> 40:14.703
Warp core breach in 30 seconds.

40:14.779 --> 40:16.940
Where are we going?

40:17.014 --> 40:18.914
A J-class nebula
filled with ionized gas.

40:18.983 --> 40:20.143
Should contain the explosion.

40:20.217 --> 40:22.947
l can't get the ejection
subroutines on line.

40:23.087 --> 40:25.078
Warp core breach in 20 seconds.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.420
So what's your answer?

40:27.491 --> 40:28.583
My answer?

40:28.659 --> 40:31.287
Will you marry me?

40:31.362 --> 40:33.455
Warp core breach in 15 seconds.

40:33.531 --> 40:34.964
You're proposing now?

40:35.032 --> 40:36.294
lt's as good a time as any.

40:36.367 --> 40:38.858
Subroutines back on line.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.404
Warp core breach in ten seconds,
nine, eight...

40:45.009 --> 40:45.941
Clear!

40:46.010 --> 40:46.874
-...four...
-Go!

40:46.944 --> 40:47.968
...three...

41:02.226 --> 41:03.420
Damn.

41:07.865 --> 41:11.323
l'm sorry your team
didn't win, Captain.

41:11.402 --> 41:13.336
Janeway to the Bridge.
Report.

41:13.404 --> 41:16.840
That was a shock wave
from an antimatter explosion

41:16.941 --> 41:19.842
approximately 1.2 million
kilometers from here.

41:19.910 --> 41:21.207
Excuse me.

41:28.853 --> 41:30.616
B'Elanna...

41:33.791 --> 41:35.224
l guess we lost.

41:35.292 --> 41:37.226
That depends.

41:37.294 --> 41:39.091
On what?

41:39.163 --> 41:41.757
On how you answer my question.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.732
l thought you only asked it

41:43.834 --> 41:46.234
because we were
about to explode.

41:46.303 --> 41:48.567
Well, we're still alive...

41:48.639 --> 41:50.539
and l'm still asking.

41:53.744 --> 41:55.837
How come you never
asked me before?

41:55.913 --> 41:57.471
How come you're still
avoiding the question?

41:57.548 --> 41:58.480
l'm thinking.

41:58.549 --> 41:59.743
Think faster.

41:59.817 --> 42:01.444
Why? You're gonna
withdraw the question?

42:01.552 --> 42:03.884
No, but l might start to beg.

42:03.921 --> 42:05.821
Could get embarrassing.

42:08.826 --> 42:11.659
Captain's Log, supplemental.

42:11.729 --> 42:13.754
The Antarians have invited us

42:13.831 --> 42:16.197
to participate
in the post-race festivities,

42:16.267 --> 42:19.395
which has allowed me to give
two of my senior officers

42:19.503 --> 42:22.597
time off for a well-deserved
romantic getaway.

42:22.706 --> 42:25.334
The Delta Flyer still needs
a new warp core,

42:25.409 --> 42:28.742
but l don't think they're
in a hurry to get anywhere.

42:28.812 --> 42:32.111
To... the winners.

42:37.154 --> 42:40.248
''B'Elanna Paris''--
that has a nice ring to it.

42:40.324 --> 42:42.292
Thanks, but l
already have a ring.

42:44.328 --> 42:47.786
Anyway, l kind of like
the sound of ''Tom Torres.''

42:47.865 --> 42:49.730
l hope you're kidding.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.292
Hey... it is the 24th century.
