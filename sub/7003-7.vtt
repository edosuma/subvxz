00:03.202 --> 00:05.236
You want your bedroom
the color of a football.

00:05.237 --> 00:07.238
Your wife wants it
the color of a daisy.

00:07.239 --> 00:10.008
What color
do you prefer, men?
Football!

00:10.009 --> 00:11.476
Hey, hey!
Daisy.

00:12.845 --> 00:14.679
<i>(cheering)</i>

00:16.782 --> 00:19.951
Well, tim, I like my bedroom
to be light and airy.

00:22.187 --> 00:24.455
Just like al.

00:24.456 --> 00:26.591
We're going to paint the bedroom
the color of a football.

00:26.592 --> 00:28.760
Now, how do we match
this color perfectly?

00:28.761 --> 00:31.696
We use the binford
250 paint boy.
Right.

00:31.697 --> 00:34.265
It mixes the color
and analyzes the pigments.

00:34.266 --> 00:38.003
Would that be
the three little pigments?

00:38.004 --> 00:39.537
No, tim, it wouldn't.

00:39.538 --> 00:41.740
Sure it would.
Take your football,

00:41.741 --> 00:45.343
Set it underneath
the electric eye,
press your color key,

00:45.344 --> 00:48.647
And boom -
we've got ourselves
touchdown brown.

00:48.648 --> 00:51.082
And this works with more
than just footballs.

00:51.083 --> 00:53.184
You can duplicate
any of your favorite colors.

00:53.185 --> 00:54.452
That's right.

00:54.453 --> 00:59.157
Antifreeze green,
roadkill gray... Oh.

00:59.158 --> 01:02.160
Smash-your-thumb-
with-a-hammer purple.

01:02.161 --> 01:04.328
But today, we develop a color
just for <i>tool time -</i>

01:04.328 --> 01:06.031
The color al.

01:07.533 --> 01:08.667
Excuse me, tim?

01:08.668 --> 01:10.669
I'm gonna make a color
out of you.

01:10.670 --> 01:13.504
You'll be bigger
than fuchsia.

01:13.505 --> 01:15.406
This is
absolutely ridiculous.

01:15.407 --> 01:17.709
Let's show 'em
what the machine can do.
Play along, al.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.744
That's not what
the machine...

01:19.745 --> 01:22.013
Al, just put your finger
in there.

01:22.014 --> 01:23.614
There you go.

01:23.615 --> 01:25.183
Ok.

01:27.787 --> 01:30.755
One part pasty white,
two parts flannel. Ok.

01:33.826 --> 01:35.560
I don't wanna be a color.

01:35.561 --> 01:38.797
Neither did red,
and look how well
things turned out for him.

01:39.799 --> 01:43.735
Computer's in.
All right.

01:43.736 --> 01:46.705
<i>(burbling)</i>
oh, yeah.

01:46.706 --> 01:51.676
Now we got a bucket of al,
and I'm ready to paint
with big al here. Ok.

01:51.677 --> 01:55.747
Of course, al is economical
in the gallon size here.

01:55.748 --> 01:58.449
Al goes on smooth,
just like that.

02:25.111 --> 02:27.578
The al paint can be cleaned up
with soap and water.

02:27.579 --> 02:30.281
Unlike the real al,
which needs turpentine
and a wire brush.

02:32.718 --> 02:35.754
For larger jobs -
industrial buildings
and warehouses -

02:35.755 --> 02:38.623
We suggest a roller
and a couple of gallons
of al's mom.

03:51.730 --> 03:54.165
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

03:58.804 --> 04:01.372
Hey, tim.
Hey, joe. What's up?

04:01.373 --> 04:03.374
Hey,
what are you doin'?

04:03.375 --> 04:05.877
Taking my hot rod apart.

04:05.878 --> 04:08.279
Didn't you just
put this thing together?
Or am I nuts?

04:08.280 --> 04:10.448
Bingo on both counts.

04:12.017 --> 04:13.818
I'm taking it apart
piece by piece,

04:13.819 --> 04:16.087
Send it to my paint guy -
fred axleby.

04:16.088 --> 04:18.689
Should be all ready to go
in two months.

04:18.690 --> 04:21.326
Two months? I got
a paint guy who'll
spray it in one hour.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.527
You don't even have to
get out of the car.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.732
In one hour?
Will he develop my film?

04:27.733 --> 04:32.136
Oh. Sorry. So,
is marie over here?

04:32.137 --> 04:34.172
She and jill are in
looking at dresses

04:34.173 --> 04:36.174
For that library
fund-raiser thing.

04:36.175 --> 04:38.743
Which is why
I'm in the garage.

04:38.744 --> 04:41.445
Women and clothes! Why
do they make such a big deal
out of what they wear?

04:41.446 --> 04:43.314
It's important.

04:43.315 --> 04:47.018
In my case, I'm thinking about
a three-piece pin-striped
blue suit

04:47.019 --> 04:48.753
With tasseled loafers.

04:48.754 --> 04:50.654
But I'll almost certain
I'm gonna go with

04:50.655 --> 04:52.656
The off-the-shoulder
taffeta gown with the pumps.

04:52.657 --> 04:54.792
Can't. That's what
I'm wearing.

04:54.793 --> 04:57.795
I'll go with the sling-backs.
That's a good look for you.

04:57.796 --> 04:59.030
Ok.

04:59.031 --> 05:02.367
Ohh.
That is beautiful!

05:02.368 --> 05:06.704
I don't know.
It is really expensive.

05:06.705 --> 05:10.208
Oh, god!
Even my butt looks good.

05:12.378 --> 05:14.979
Come on, jill. You know
you deserve this dress.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.048
The library
is halfway at its goal
because of you.

05:17.049 --> 05:19.384
Why else do you think
we're having a dinner
in your honor?

05:19.385 --> 05:22.453
No, I can't. I don't even know
if I can sit down in this thing.

05:22.454 --> 05:25.689
So what?
It's a buffet.

05:25.690 --> 05:27.625
Hey, hon. Hey, jill.
<i>(jill)</i> hi, joe.

05:27.626 --> 05:30.395
Tim, how sensational
does jill look in this dress?

05:30.396 --> 05:32.130
Wow!

05:32.131 --> 05:34.465
She looks good.
I've always liked her
in that dress.

05:36.568 --> 05:39.703
Tim, this is brand-new.
You've never seen it before.

05:39.704 --> 05:42.673
On you.
I've seen it.

05:42.674 --> 05:45.509
Al's got that dress.

05:45.510 --> 05:48.479
Tim, tell her
to forget about the money
and buy the dress, please.

05:50.582 --> 05:53.985
Honey, buy the dress.
You never do anything
nice for yourself.

05:53.986 --> 05:55.320
You know how you are.

05:55.321 --> 05:57.355
What do you mean?
How am I?

05:57.356 --> 05:59.958
You're... Tight, thrifty,
cheap, cheap-o.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.726
I am not cheap!
I'm... Frugal.

06:02.727 --> 06:05.163
Frugal? You save
pickle juice.

06:05.164 --> 06:08.333
I re-use it
in the tuna fish.

06:08.334 --> 06:11.569
If you like the dress, buy it.
We'll save money some other way.

06:11.570 --> 06:14.138
We won't feed the kids
for a couple of months.

06:14.139 --> 06:17.475
Hey, I got a dress guy
who'll get you the same thing
for half.

06:17.476 --> 06:19.710
No. Really? For half?
Mm-hmm.

06:19.711 --> 06:21.745
Not a knockoff?
Not a second?

06:21.746 --> 06:24.082
The same exact dress.
It's completely
on the up and up.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.951
Wow. Ok.
What's his name?

06:26.952 --> 06:29.187
Can't say.

06:29.188 --> 06:30.488
Well, what's his number?

06:30.489 --> 06:32.923
No, you don't call him.
He calls you.

06:32.924 --> 06:37.561
And when he calls,
you say, "the swallows
fly... At midnight."

06:40.299 --> 06:43.034
No, really. Is this on
the up and up? You swear?

06:43.035 --> 06:46.770
I guarantee it.
I've known the guy for years.
I'll have him call you tomorrow.

06:46.771 --> 06:50.674
Great. Ok. But make sure,
because I gotta have this
by the end of the week.

06:50.675 --> 06:54.145
There's the designer,
this is the dress size.
Don't tell anybody.

06:54.146 --> 06:57.581
I'd better get this off
before I do something to it.
See you later, marie.

06:57.582 --> 06:59.583
And thank you, joe!
Sure.

06:59.584 --> 07:01.585
Tim, the photo lab called.

07:01.586 --> 07:03.721
They said you didn't
bring in the picture yet.

07:03.722 --> 07:05.456
Picture?

07:05.457 --> 07:08.059
The picture of jill
you were supposed to
bring in three weeks ago.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.793
Picture?

07:09.794 --> 07:11.795
The one we're gonna blow up
and have everyone sign
at the dinner.

07:11.796 --> 07:13.531
The picture.

07:13.532 --> 07:15.566
You gotta get it
to the photo lab by six

07:15.567 --> 07:17.435
If we're gonna have it
on Saturday night.

07:17.436 --> 07:20.671
No problem.
All right.
You know, it's 5:30 now.

07:20.672 --> 07:24.175
Big problem.
Huge problem. I know.

07:24.176 --> 07:28.112
I can't believe the dress
isn't here yet. We have to
be there in 25 minutes.

07:28.113 --> 07:30.548
Why did I ever get involved
with joe's dress guy?

07:30.549 --> 07:33.251
Because you're frugal.
<i>(jill sighs)</i>

07:33.252 --> 07:35.886
You should never have let me
return that dress.

07:35.887 --> 07:38.356
I tried to talk you into
buying the dress.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.791
Don't argue with me now,
please.

07:40.792 --> 07:42.826
We've got to get out of here.
Come on. You look great.

07:42.827 --> 07:44.929
I'm wearing a bathrobe!

07:44.930 --> 07:46.931
Put on some slippers.
Let's go.

07:46.932 --> 07:50.201
Wait. Why don't you wear
that slinky blue dress
that's low-cut...

07:50.202 --> 07:52.203
I don't have a blue dress.

07:52.204 --> 07:54.205
Then who was that?

07:54.206 --> 07:57.575
Oh, I remember.
Oh, ho-ho!

07:57.576 --> 07:58.642
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

07:58.643 --> 08:00.311
Oh, good.
He's finally here.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.516
Oh, no. It's just al.

08:05.517 --> 08:07.985
It's not exactly
"glad to see you,"
but I'll take it.

08:07.986 --> 08:10.455
Sorry. It's just that
I'm waiting for somebody.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.356
Well, you look great.

08:12.357 --> 08:15.926
I'm wearing a robe.
Doesn't anybody notice?
I'm wearing a robe!

08:17.229 --> 08:19.230
Hey, guys.
Hey, al!

08:19.231 --> 08:21.966
All right! Yeah! Hey!

08:21.967 --> 08:24.335
I got a big evening planned
for us tonight.

08:24.336 --> 08:26.737
Can we go see
<i>blood-sucking vampires</i>
<i>from mars?</i>

08:26.738 --> 08:29.607
No, you're not
seeing that movie.
Why not?

08:29.608 --> 08:32.076
I wanna see that
as a family.

08:32.077 --> 08:34.578
No, we're not gonna
go see a movie tonight.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.847
I thought we'd do something
a little more interactive.

08:37.849 --> 08:41.652
How does... Miniature golf
at the putt putt panorama
sound?

08:41.653 --> 08:44.855
Hey, cool! They have
an awesome video arcade.

08:44.856 --> 08:46.190
No, no, no!

08:46.191 --> 08:48.226
You don't go to putt putt
to play video games.

08:48.227 --> 08:51.962
You go there for one thing
and one thing only -
miniature golf.

08:51.963 --> 08:53.264
All right! Let's go!

08:53.265 --> 08:56.900
I don't know.
I'd rather see a movie.

08:56.901 --> 08:59.537
Yeah. I wanna see
<i>the nuttiest raccoon.</i>

08:59.538 --> 09:01.539
<i>The nuttiest raccoon?</i>

09:01.540 --> 09:04.975
Trust me, mark, it's
a big disappointment.
He was not that nutty.

09:07.145 --> 09:09.547
I can't believe
I had to wear this dress.

09:09.548 --> 09:11.549
Everybody's seen it.
I've worn it a thousand times.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.717
I've taken it in, out,
up, down...

09:13.718 --> 09:15.719
Jill, I'm really sorry
about this.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.622
But you'll be happy to know
that, as of this minute,

09:17.623 --> 09:19.624
I'm getting
a new dress guy.

09:19.625 --> 09:22.960
Joe, don't take this
the wrong way, but...
I have to kill you.

09:22.961 --> 09:25.496
Honey, honey.

09:25.497 --> 09:29.467
The parking-lot attendant
loved this dress. He said
his mom's got one like it.

09:29.468 --> 09:31.502
Marie, come with me.
I gotta go fix my face.

09:31.503 --> 09:32.503
Good idea.

09:34.105 --> 09:36.307
Not that... There's
nothing wrong with...

09:36.308 --> 09:38.676
I didn't...
There's no reason...

09:38.677 --> 09:40.678
Boy, your wife
is really steamed.

09:40.679 --> 09:43.147
Welcome to my world.

09:43.148 --> 09:45.183
There's jill's picture.

09:45.184 --> 09:48.085
I'll write something
nice on it. Maybe she
won't be so mad at me.

10:01.633 --> 10:03.934
That's the picture
you picked out?

10:03.935 --> 10:07.338
It looked a lot better
on her driver's license,
I'll tell you that.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.041
You blew up
her driver's license?

10:11.042 --> 10:13.611
It's all I could find.
She hid all the photo albums.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.613
Oh, boy, are you
in trouble.

10:15.614 --> 10:17.981
No. I'm dead.

10:17.982 --> 10:21.652
I'm past dead.
I'm deader than dead.

10:21.653 --> 10:24.388
You know, but
the good news is,
I'm off the hook.

10:26.825 --> 10:28.826
I'm gonna get
something to eat.

10:32.464 --> 10:34.898
Honey, honey. You don't
wanna go in there.

10:34.899 --> 10:37.000
Why not?

10:37.001 --> 10:40.304
You're the guest of honor.
We gotta make a big hit.
Let's go in the back way.

10:40.305 --> 10:42.340
No, no, no.
There is no back way.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.575
There is no back way.
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

10:44.576 --> 10:47.245
Let's go through the basement,
get in the heating ducts,
crawl up,

10:47.246 --> 10:50.114
At the right time,
pop through a vent,
"hi. I'm jill."

10:50.115 --> 10:51.549
What?!

10:51.550 --> 10:53.517
Trust me.
I have a tv show.

10:53.518 --> 10:56.053
In front of an audience,
it'll be huge!

10:56.054 --> 10:58.489
Tim, quit kidding.
I wanna show jill
the surprise we got her.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.924
No, you don't.
What surprise?

11:00.925 --> 11:03.093
The committee did something
special, but we can't take
all the credit.

11:03.094 --> 11:05.095
Remember, tim picked out
the picture.

11:05.096 --> 11:09.333
Oh, honey. You
gave me a surprise.
That's so nice.

11:09.334 --> 11:12.936
Gosh, darn it.
Why don't we all see
the surprise together?

11:12.937 --> 11:15.005
<i>(gasps)</i>

11:15.006 --> 11:18.376
You blew up
my driver's license
picture?!

11:18.377 --> 11:20.611
That's the surprise.

11:22.180 --> 11:24.815
I gotta go fix my face.

11:37.562 --> 11:39.563
Well, honey...

11:39.564 --> 11:42.767
All in all, it was
a pretty good evening,
wasn't it?

11:45.537 --> 11:47.871
It was a great speech.

11:47.872 --> 11:50.374
Ah, that roast beef
was good, wasn't it?

11:50.375 --> 11:53.911
Who would've thought
of serving potatoes
with the roast beef?

11:53.912 --> 11:56.246
What was that sauce they had,
special sauce they had...?

11:56.247 --> 11:57.782
Gravy.
Gravy.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.620
But it was beef gravy,
it was spiced, it was so...

12:02.621 --> 12:05.088
Shut up, tim.
Oh.

12:05.089 --> 12:09.794
How could you blow up
my driver's license picture?
How could you do that?

12:09.795 --> 12:12.430
Well, it was better-looking
than your passport photo.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.932
Were there only
two choices here?

12:14.933 --> 12:17.768
Tim, there's
tons of pictures of me
in this house.

12:17.769 --> 12:19.470
I didn't have time.

12:19.471 --> 12:21.004
Why not?

12:21.005 --> 12:23.273
'cause marie sprang this on me
at the last minute.

12:23.274 --> 12:24.475
The last minute?

12:24.476 --> 12:26.477
The very last minute.

12:26.478 --> 12:29.046
If she'd given me some time,
I'd have picked out
a perfect picture.

12:29.047 --> 12:32.616
Oh. So you're just saying
this was all marie's fault.

12:32.617 --> 12:34.618
I wouldn't want to point
the finger at her.

12:34.619 --> 12:36.620
In fact, I wouldn't even
mention it to her.

12:36.621 --> 12:38.689
Who are you calling?
The time.

12:38.690 --> 12:41.359
Oh, I got the time.
It's 9:35.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.260
Hello, marie?
Oh, boy.

12:43.261 --> 12:46.564
How much time did you give tim
to get that picture?

12:53.071 --> 12:55.573
Three weeks. Yeah, yeah.
Thanks, marie. Bye.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.242
Hey, how's marie?

12:58.243 --> 13:01.812
Three weeks.
You said the last minute.

13:01.813 --> 13:03.681
Who are you
gonna believe?

13:05.283 --> 13:09.186
My... My guess
would be marie.

13:09.187 --> 13:13.223
Thank you for ruining
one of the most important
nights of my life.

13:13.224 --> 13:15.225
It didn't ruin it.
You raised all the money.

13:15.226 --> 13:17.261
People loved your speech.
Oh, come on.

13:17.262 --> 13:20.297
There is a bright spot.
Everybody was laughin'
so hard at the picture,

13:20.298 --> 13:22.733
They didn't see
that skaggy dress
you have on.

13:24.903 --> 13:26.670
<i>(door slams)</i>

13:26.671 --> 13:29.507
Hey, why don't I just
sleep on the couch?

13:31.943 --> 13:33.343
We're back!

13:33.344 --> 13:36.213
Hey, dad, I beat al.
I got a hole in one.

13:37.382 --> 13:39.383
Yes, he got a hole in one!

13:39.384 --> 13:41.485
Do we have to keep
hearing about it?

13:41.486 --> 13:44.488
Brad got a hole in one.
Yippee, yippee, yippee.

13:45.624 --> 13:48.626
Sounds like you ruffled
a few feathers.

13:48.627 --> 13:51.529
When he plays miniature golf,
he's like a different person.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.697
That could be a good thing.

13:53.698 --> 13:55.900
Dad, he's psycho golfer.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.636
I happen to take the game
seriously.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.337
Al, it's just
miniature golf.

14:00.338 --> 14:03.674
Dad, he brought
his own clubs.

14:03.675 --> 14:06.510
Even a 7-iron.

14:06.511 --> 14:08.345
He made a little girl cry.

14:08.346 --> 14:11.014
Well, she walked
right in front of
the clown's mouth!

14:14.152 --> 14:16.921
Well, something
had to be said.

14:18.757 --> 14:20.758
The manager kicked us out.

14:20.759 --> 14:25.128
Al is now banned for life
from the putt putt panorama.

14:25.129 --> 14:27.364
Well, big deal!

14:27.365 --> 14:32.770
As soon as that manager
graduates from high school,
I'll be back.

14:32.771 --> 14:34.505
While you're waitin', al,

14:34.506 --> 14:37.307
Why don't you look into
miniature golfers anonymous?

14:37.308 --> 14:41.445
Oh, boy. That is a terrib...Ly
nice picture of you.

14:43.448 --> 14:44.515
Thanks a lot, al.

14:44.516 --> 14:47.150
<i>(boys)</i> hi, mom.
Whoa!

14:47.151 --> 14:51.722
Mom, is that you?
That's the worst picture
I've ever seen.

14:51.723 --> 14:55.893
Yeah. You look like
the nuttiest raccoon.

14:55.894 --> 14:58.428
Your father picked it out.

14:58.429 --> 14:59.830
Way to go, dad.

14:59.831 --> 15:03.467
Wouldn't wanna be
in your shoes, bud.

15:03.468 --> 15:06.837
Go to bed!
Brush your teeth!

15:10.174 --> 15:12.610
I'm... I'm real sorry
about this picture, jill.

15:12.611 --> 15:16.780
Look, I'm not just upset
about the picture.

15:16.781 --> 15:20.417
I'm upset because of the fact
that you never even realized

15:20.418 --> 15:23.453
How important
this whole night was to me.

15:23.454 --> 15:24.788
I know now.

15:24.789 --> 15:27.024
You should've known before.

15:27.025 --> 15:29.960
I've been talking about
the library fund-raiser
for months,

15:29.961 --> 15:32.195
And every time I do,
your eyes just glaze over,

15:32.196 --> 15:34.865
And you go,
"uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh."

15:34.866 --> 15:36.901
Uh-huh.

15:36.902 --> 15:37.968
Right.

15:37.969 --> 15:41.338
Honey, that's how
I concentrate.

15:41.339 --> 15:45.843
So, you're saying that you
heard everything I said about
the library fund-raiser?

15:45.844 --> 15:48.245
Yeah. It's right up here.
Yeah?

15:48.246 --> 15:52.182
Well... What are we
raising money for?

15:52.183 --> 15:53.751
The library.

15:53.752 --> 15:57.287
What part of the library?

15:57.288 --> 16:00.858
The part of the library
that needs money
raised for it.

16:00.859 --> 16:03.460
You see? It's useless.

16:03.461 --> 16:07.531
I guess it's too much to expect
you to put yourself aside
and think of me for a change.

16:07.532 --> 16:09.633
Wait a minute.
You don't always listen

16:09.634 --> 16:11.669
When I'm telling you stuff
that's important to me.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.871
Tim, when you talk,
I listen.

16:13.872 --> 16:15.105
Really?
Yeah!

16:15.106 --> 16:16.373
Uh-huh.

16:20.411 --> 16:22.713
What kind of carburetors
are on the hot rod?

16:22.714 --> 16:24.715
Holley double pumpers.
Holley... What?

16:26.284 --> 16:29.519
Holley double pumpers.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.521
I've told you
about the engine.

16:31.522 --> 16:33.591
What kind of engine do I have
in the hot rod? Huh?

16:33.592 --> 16:36.927
350 small block,
bored 30 over
with a 400 crank.

16:36.928 --> 16:38.596
Tires?

16:38.597 --> 16:40.130
185/60 r-14s.

16:40.131 --> 16:42.766
Aha!

16:42.767 --> 16:46.003
They're 195s!

16:46.004 --> 16:48.271
And you say you listen to me.

16:52.343 --> 16:54.878
Is it written on here
somewhere?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.786
Hi-ho, neighbor.

17:02.787 --> 17:04.989
Hidey-ho, wilson.

17:04.990 --> 17:08.224
Jill!
What a pleasant surprise.

17:08.226 --> 17:09.259
You're out late.

17:09.260 --> 17:12.329
Mm-hmm. Just doing
a little stargazing.

17:12.329 --> 17:14.932
You know, they say if you had
a strong enough telescope,

17:14.933 --> 17:17.400
You could look back in time
to very early man

17:17.401 --> 17:19.569
Before his brain
was fully developed.

17:19.569 --> 17:23.507
Come over to our house.
You can see the same thing
without a telescope.

17:25.309 --> 17:27.277
Trouble
in the taylor galaxy?

17:27.278 --> 17:29.479
Yeah. It's the big dip.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.414
Tim?

17:31.415 --> 17:34.718
I just don't think
he's ever gonna change.

17:34.719 --> 17:38.421
When I first met him, I thought
he had such great potential
for sensitivity.

17:38.422 --> 17:42.325
But here it is 15 years later,
and he's still stuck
at "potential."

17:42.326 --> 17:45.829
Well, jill,
I can understand
your frustration.

17:45.830 --> 17:47.564
You know, it's been said

17:47.565 --> 17:50.333
That men marry women
hoping they won't change.

17:50.334 --> 17:52.569
Women marry men
hoping they will.

17:52.570 --> 17:55.839
Are you saying
there's no hope?
No, not necessarily.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.108
In the time I've known tim,

17:58.109 --> 18:00.144
I've seen him progress
and evolve significantly.

18:00.145 --> 18:03.446
We're talking about
tim "the tool man" taylor?

18:03.447 --> 18:06.016
Yes, indeed.
As a matter of fact,
when he first moved in,

18:06.017 --> 18:08.585
I had to remind him
when your birthday was.

18:08.586 --> 18:10.587
Now I just have to remind him
to get a gift.

18:12.190 --> 18:14.958
Well, I guess
that's some improvement.

18:14.959 --> 18:17.394
His table manners
are better.

18:17.395 --> 18:19.963
It's been a while
since I've seen him
shoot peas out his nose.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.001
Well, there you go.

18:24.002 --> 18:28.706
It's just...
He's evolving so slowly.

18:28.707 --> 18:32.676
Well, jill, I'm reminded
of an old chinese proverb -

18:32.677 --> 18:34.745
Be not afraid
of growing slowly.

18:34.746 --> 18:38.949
Be afraid
only of standing still.

18:38.950 --> 18:42.552
I'm sure that
tim will eventually become
the man you want him to be.

18:42.553 --> 18:46.256
Yeah, but with my luck,
he'll be 101,

18:46.257 --> 18:50.460
And he'll
listen to everything I say,
but he won't know who I am.

18:53.198 --> 18:56.333
Today on <i>tool time,</i>
the name of the game is frames.

18:56.334 --> 18:58.936
You can frame a house.

18:59.938 --> 19:02.139
You can frame your lenses.

19:03.541 --> 19:05.976
You can frame... A co-worker.

19:11.750 --> 19:15.052
Tim, we're supposed
to be talking about
picture frames.

19:15.053 --> 19:18.521
A good frame can accentuate
the beauty of any subject.

19:18.522 --> 19:20.690
Of course,
there's exceptions
to every rule.

19:25.730 --> 19:29.366
We'll be cutting our wood
at a 45-degree angle
with our miter box.

19:29.367 --> 19:33.871
While al's busy working,
I'd like to veer off the subject
for a little bit, if I could.

19:33.872 --> 19:36.874
I don't think men
know just how selfish
we can be sometimes.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.876
It might come to a shock
to the audience here,

19:38.877 --> 19:41.145
But the old "tool man"
can be a little insensitive
at times.

19:41.146 --> 19:43.080
I know I'm taken aback.

19:45.549 --> 19:46.950
<i>(mouths)</i>

19:46.951 --> 19:50.453
How often do we
put ourselves aside

19:50.454 --> 19:54.724
And think about
the women in our lives
we cherish?

20:01.732 --> 20:05.735
<i>I know all the wives out there</i>
<i>know I'm kidding around...</i>

20:05.736 --> 20:08.605
I know there's
some point to this,
but I'm not seeing it.

20:08.606 --> 20:11.241
I was thinking about
what you said,

20:11.242 --> 20:13.410
So I got you
something special.

20:15.313 --> 20:16.880
<i>(gasps)</i>

20:16.881 --> 20:20.083
Tim, I don't believe
you did this.

20:20.084 --> 20:22.986
I just wanted
everyone to see you
like I see you.

20:22.987 --> 20:25.055
Honey, that's really sweet.

20:25.056 --> 20:27.090
Not only did I get
the right picture
this time,

20:27.091 --> 20:29.492
I went and had everybody
re-sign it.

20:29.493 --> 20:32.395
Even that plastic surgeon
who wrote, "I hope you have
a good personality"?

20:35.233 --> 20:37.267
You should've
seen his face

20:37.268 --> 20:39.870
When I walked in
during liposuction
to get the signature.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.306
Oh... Tim.

20:42.307 --> 20:45.209
This is so great
that you did this.

20:45.210 --> 20:48.678
But, um... You know,
I just gotta say,

20:48.679 --> 20:52.549
It's really big.
So what are we gonna do with it?

20:52.550 --> 20:56.253
I'll buy you a big wallet.
<i>(laughs)</i>

20:56.254 --> 21:00.423
In the meantime, tonight
I'm gonna cook you
a fabulous dinner.

21:00.424 --> 21:03.227
Steak, mashed potatoes
and peas.

21:03.228 --> 21:05.695
That is so sweet.

21:05.696 --> 21:07.697
I'm gonna use those
little peas I can shoot
halfway across the room.

21:14.339 --> 21:16.439
Two players,
one shot apiece.

21:16.440 --> 21:20.643
The 13-year-old versus
al "I got a slice" borland.

21:20.644 --> 21:22.712
Dad, this is so stupid.

21:22.713 --> 21:24.882
Afraid, huh?

21:24.883 --> 21:27.017
He's afraid of you?
I don't think so, al.

21:27.018 --> 21:30.053
Good! You got the whole thing
put together...

21:30.054 --> 21:33.757
Tim, I thought
we threw that away.

21:33.758 --> 21:35.926
I'm recycling.

21:35.927 --> 21:39.629
Could we have some quiet here?
I'm trying to line up my shot.

21:39.630 --> 21:42.599
Boy, take a pill,
will you?

21:42.600 --> 21:45.668
It's not your shot, anyway.
Brad the champion goes first.

21:45.669 --> 21:48.906
Champion, champion,
champion. Just go.

21:50.275 --> 21:53.543
Loosen up your swing.
Concentrate.

22:01.119 --> 22:03.320
<i>(cheering)</i>

22:09.560 --> 22:11.228
Can I... Can I go now?

22:11.229 --> 22:13.063
The game is not over.

22:16.867 --> 22:18.735
Pressure's on, al.

22:18.736 --> 22:22.973
Next up,
al "the double bogeyman"
borland.

22:26.444 --> 22:29.413
Al's always had trouble
on these greens here.

22:29.414 --> 22:31.614
Doesn't like
the concession... Area.

22:51.002 --> 22:52.569
And you can use this
with more...

22:52.570 --> 22:54.004
<i>(garbles words)</i>
<i>(tim laughs)</i>

22:55.974 --> 22:57.240
Aah!

22:57.241 --> 23:00.643
<i>(stage manager)</i>
again. 4, 3...

23:00.644 --> 23:04.314
And you can use this
with more than just footballs.

23:04.315 --> 23:05.715
<i>(woman giggles)</i>

23:05.716 --> 23:07.684
What's... What is...?
<i>(giggling)</i>

23:10.754 --> 23:13.690
What's the line?
<i>(laughter)</i>

23:13.691 --> 23:16.259
And this works with more
than just footballs.
Work with more than just...

23:16.260 --> 23:18.395
This works with more than
just footballs.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.930
You can also duplicate
any of your favorite colors.

23:20.931 --> 23:23.066
That's right.
<i>(laughter)</i>
