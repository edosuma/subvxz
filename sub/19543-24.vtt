00:02.252 --> 00:06.962
Vegeta had successfully seized a Dragon Ball.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.666
In order to protect the last one,

00:10.761 --> 00:14.925
Kuririn and Dende rush to the Grand Elder.

00:18.602 --> 00:24.017
Elsewhere, the other five Dragon Balls
have fallen into Freeza's hands.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.101
All right... good...

02:33.195 --> 02:36.813
I've gotten pretty accustomed
to 20-times gravity.

02:36.907 --> 02:41.025
Now, how about I try 30-times?

02:41.119 --> 02:45.909
Goku! Do you hear me? Goku! Huh?

02:45.999 --> 02:49.742
Hmm? Ah, that voice! Is that you, Kaio-sama?

02:49.837 --> 02:53.045
Yeah, it's Kaio, all right.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.838
You're not, by any chance, in space, are you?

02:55.926 --> 02:58.588
What are you doing in space?

02:58.679 --> 03:02.137
Oh, I see. Planet Namek, right?

03:02.224 --> 03:04.806
I hope you do find Dragon Balls there.

03:04.893 --> 03:08.977
What, you didn't know, Kaio-sama?

03:09.064 --> 03:11.771
There's something terrible
happening on Planet Namek.

03:11.859 --> 03:16.478
Something terrible? Well,
you can tell me about it later.

03:16.572 --> 03:19.530
As it turns out, I've had some visitors come by.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.574
Visitors? What about them?

03:22.661 --> 03:27.155
It's incredible! These visitors
traveled the Serpentine Road

03:27.249 --> 03:31.117
and arrived here in far less time than you did.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.953
What's more, there are four of them.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.299
--Four of them?
--That's right.

03:36.383 --> 03:40.046
And I'm sure you know these four quite well.

03:40.137 --> 03:42.048
l-lt couldn't be!

03:47.352 --> 03:52.096
They all want to receive training
even more strenuous than you got.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.441
T-That's awesome!

03:56.528 --> 04:01.067
You mean they all arrived at
your place together, Kaio-sama?

04:01.158 --> 04:03.865
May I speak to Goku?

04:03.952 --> 04:07.536
Place your hand on my shoulder, and then talk.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.697
Yo, do you hear me, Goku?

04:10.792 --> 04:11.827
Yamucha!

04:11.919 --> 04:14.285
We met the departed
Kami-sama in the Next World,

04:14.379 --> 04:17.791
and he told us about this place.

04:17.882 --> 04:22.091
Hey, we heard that you are
going to Piccolo's homeworld,

04:22.179 --> 04:24.716
to look for the Dragon Balls,

04:24.806 --> 04:28.219
so that you can bring us back to life.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.016
You said there were four of you, right?

04:30.103 --> 04:33.687
Yamucha, Tenshinhan... and is
Piccolo there, by any chance?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.355
Yeah, Piccolo's here, too.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.104
Hmph, my pride wouldn't allow

04:38.195 --> 04:40.937
for you to be the only one who got stronger.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.989
Who is the other one? Is it Kami-sama?

04:44.076 --> 04:47.568
No, not him. Kami-sama
stayed in the Next World.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.153
Get this, it's Chaozu!

04:49.247 --> 04:54.492
Chaozu?! But Chaozu got
blown to pieces. Is he all right?

04:54.586 --> 04:59.626
Yeah. Kami-sama regenerated
a body, especially for him.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.334
That's awesome! Good for you, Chaozu!

05:04.680 --> 05:07.387
I'll tell you, though, the gravity here has us beat.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.136
Our bodies are so heavy,
we can't even run properly.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.388
Yeah, I know, I know.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.266
But right now, I'm headed
for this Planet Namek place,

05:15.357 --> 05:16.938
which has the Dragon Balls,

05:17.025 --> 05:20.358
and I've started training under
much, much more intense gravity.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.982
l have to get much stronger in
the next five and a half days,

05:23.073 --> 05:25.234
or there's gonna be real big trouble.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.613
Eh? What do you mean? What happened?

05:28.704 --> 05:32.868
I was severely injured,
so Kuririn, Bulma and Gohan

05:32.958 --> 05:35.700
went to Planet Namek to
look for the Dragon Balls.

05:35.794 --> 05:38.786
But once they got there, that Saiyan, Vegeta,

05:38.880 --> 05:40.791
was also there looking for the Dragon Balls.

05:40.882 --> 05:44.466
--What?!
--S-So then, did they get
themselves killed by him?!

05:44.553 --> 05:46.965
No, it looks like Vegeta still ain't realized

05:47.055 --> 05:49.216
that Kuririn and the others are there.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.798
But that ain't all, either.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.509
There's something else, even more unbelievable.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.812
There are apparently some other
strange folks after the Dragon Balls.

05:57.899 --> 06:02.609
The weird thing is, their
outfits are just like Vegeta's.

06:02.696 --> 06:07.611
What's more, one of them has
a Ki far higher than Vegeta's.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.441
W-What?!

06:09.536 --> 06:12.699
What? What's going on?

06:12.789 --> 06:16.407
By any chance, is his name Freeza?

06:16.501 --> 06:21.086
I don't know. I ain't heard,
but when I find out, I'll tell you.

06:21.173 --> 06:24.916
If it is Freeza, this is a huge problem.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.628
G-Goku, I'm going to look in on Planet Namek.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.804
Please do, Kaio-sama!

06:30.891 --> 06:35.555
Let's see, which direction is Planet Namek...?

06:37.105 --> 06:39.938
Yamucha, tell us what's going on.

06:51.703 --> 06:54.786
|-| do sense an enormous amount of Ki, all right.

06:54.873 --> 06:57.740
Checking to see where this Ki is coming from...

07:06.718 --> 07:08.458
Wha--?

07:10.263 --> 07:13.551
Freeza!

07:13.642 --> 07:17.260
What's this? Kaio-sama, you know who it is?

07:17.354 --> 07:19.970
Goku, this time around,
your opponent is too much for you.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.680
Or I should say, he's the worst of the worst!

07:21.775 --> 07:25.267
There is no way you can handle this guy!

07:25.362 --> 07:26.647
What do you mean?

07:26.738 --> 07:31.232
Listen to me, Goku. This is
an order! Do not go near him!

07:31.326 --> 07:33.612
Once you get to Planet Namek,
take the other three aboard,

07:33.703 --> 07:35.659
and run away, immediately!

07:35.747 --> 07:38.864
I'm not just saying this for your sake.

07:38.959 --> 07:43.749
I'm saying this for Earth, Planet
Namek, and all the other worlds.

07:43.839 --> 07:47.172
If you launch a half-baked attack
on him, and get him angry,

07:47.259 --> 07:49.341
something horrific will happen!

07:49.427 --> 07:52.260
Leaving him alone is the only thing you can do!

07:52.347 --> 07:56.010
Is he really all that great?
I'd kinda like to see him.

07:56.101 --> 07:59.514
Don't you dare go near him!

07:59.604 --> 08:03.517
--Yeah, but...
--No buts about it!

08:06.820 --> 08:09.653
Goku, do whatever you have to
to gather the Dragon Balls,

08:09.739 --> 08:11.479
and bring us back to life.

08:11.575 --> 08:12.815
Piccolo!

08:12.909 --> 08:14.695
I'm going to improve myself
here even more than you did,

08:14.786 --> 08:16.902
and go to Planet Namek.

08:16.997 --> 08:21.286
Together, we'll send that absurd
what's-his-name bastard flying.

08:21.376 --> 08:26.962
D-Don't be ridiculous! You guys
don't know a thing about Freeza!

08:27.048 --> 08:30.131
There's no time. Start training us, right away.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.255
If you're planning to fight Freeza,
I won't teach you anything!

08:33.346 --> 08:37.009
Promise me that you won't go to Planet Namek.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.760
All right.

08:38.852 --> 08:42.845
You mean that, right? I'm trusting you.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.396
That goes for you guys, too!

08:48.361 --> 08:51.774
There's no way I'm going to
keep a measly promise like that.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.947
IfI do the same training that Goku did,

08:54.034 --> 08:56.025
I won't be able to surpass him.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.075
I'll have to work out the key points of the training,

08:58.163 --> 09:00.905
and then hone my techniques on my own.

09:04.753 --> 09:08.041
All right, then, let's get started.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.959
Here we go...

09:14.054 --> 09:16.261
Let's do this!

09:23.605 --> 09:26.688
First off,

09:26.775 --> 09:29.482
try to make me laugh with a pun.

09:29.569 --> 09:33.357
I will train whoever can pass this test!

09:37.118 --> 09:39.780
Even if I can't take any action,

09:39.871 --> 09:42.078
there ain't no harm in getting stronger.

09:42.165 --> 09:47.125
All right, let's try kicking it all
the way up to 50-times gravity!

09:49.547 --> 09:51.833
Hey, if we keep flying at this rate,

09:51.925 --> 09:54.667
when will we reach the Grand Elder's place?

09:54.761 --> 09:57.924
W-We should make it in another five hours.

10:00.976 --> 10:05.094
Damn, I can't find anyplace that has
multiple powers gathered together.

10:05.188 --> 10:08.521
What does this mean?
Are there no more villages?

10:11.194 --> 10:13.901
There are two powers on the move.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.150
Strange. One of them feels different

10:16.241 --> 10:20.029
from both Freeza's men and the Namekians.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.658
It's disconcerting. I think I'll go check it out.

10:27.669 --> 10:29.455
Stop, Dende!

10:29.546 --> 10:32.288
It's Vegeta! He's taken notice of us, all right!

10:32.382 --> 10:35.749
He's headed straight this
way at tremendous speed!

10:35.844 --> 10:38.005
We have to hide, now!

10:58.116 --> 11:00.323
Huh?

11:00.410 --> 11:04.198
W-What happened? He changed direction.

11:07.042 --> 11:11.081
There's another large Ki out there!
He went in that direction!

11:11.171 --> 11:14.789
This power belongs to Zarbon!
No doubt about it!

11:14.883 --> 11:18.501
I've been waiting for him
to make a move on his own!

11:35.195 --> 11:39.734
If only I had a Scouter,
finding a village would be easy.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.368
That's... Vegeta!

11:50.126 --> 11:55.496
Yo! It's been quite a long while,
hasn't it, Zarbon-san?

11:55.590 --> 12:00.550
I've already disposed of Dodoria.
Now it's your turn.

12:00.637 --> 12:05.631
What?! Y-You've disposed of Dodoria?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.511
Easily.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.308
I don't believe it.

12:09.396 --> 12:14.481
You'll be able to tell once we go at it.
I'll show you how strong I am.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.310
Vegeta, why would you
turn against Freeza-sama?

12:18.405 --> 12:24.492
That's simple. I never have
liked that Freeza bastard.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.829
Up to now, I've been forced
into submission by his power,

12:26.913 --> 12:29.074
and had no choice but to do as he said,

12:29.165 --> 12:30.666
but now, by an odd turn of events,

12:30.750 --> 12:33.662
I've learned that I can gain eternal life.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.039
You're talking about the Dragon Balls.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.668
I'm not about to let Freeza have them!

12:38.758 --> 12:40.919
Once eternal life is mine,

12:41.010 --> 12:44.628
I'm sure the chance to beat
Freeza will come along.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.007
What foolishness.

12:46.099 --> 12:50.012
Do you think eternal life is
all you need to beat Freeza?

12:50.103 --> 12:52.765
It's a shame you don't have your Scouter.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.312
By fighting many battles,

12:54.399 --> 12:58.893
I've increased my power
more than you can imagine.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.820
You're the one who doesn't understand.

13:01.906 --> 13:06.696
Freeza-sama's power far
transcends even that level.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.744
That's enough of your mindless babbling!

13:09.831 --> 13:14.575
I heard from Dodoria that
Freeza was afraid of Saiyans!

13:14.669 --> 13:18.378
I'm going to show you some
Saiyan power, right now!

13:18.465 --> 13:20.251
You've got such a swelled head.

13:20.341 --> 13:24.175
What Freeza-sama was afraid of
was the Saiyans banding together.

13:24.262 --> 13:26.719
Just one of you can't do anything.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.798
Well, we'll see about that.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.349
What?!

14:02.884 --> 14:05.045
To think that he could deflect that!

14:08.097 --> 14:11.715
Incredible! It's Ki slamming against Ki!

14:11.809 --> 14:15.427
Vegeta and someone else are mixing it up.

14:15.522 --> 14:20.232
H-His opponent is probably that
guy who was at Freeza's side.

14:20.318 --> 14:25.187
Both of them are monsters.
There's no way I can compete with them.

14:25.281 --> 14:29.149
Let's just hope the two of them
end up crushing each other.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.951
All right! Hold on to me tight!

14:32.038 --> 14:34.780
This is our chance!
While those two are battling it out,

14:34.874 --> 14:36.739
we're going to rush to the Grand Elder!

14:36.834 --> 14:40.042
If I fly all-out, we should reach there quickly!

14:40.129 --> 14:41.835
Here we go!

14:43.925 --> 14:45.415
What's the matter?!

14:45.510 --> 14:47.216
For someone as fast as the great Zarbon-sama,

14:47.303 --> 14:49.510
you look like you're standing still!

14:56.896 --> 14:58.477
What?!

15:06.781 --> 15:09.864
To think that you'd be so helpless at this level!

15:19.877 --> 15:23.495
You surprise me. You have indeed
made outstanding progress.

15:23.590 --> 15:27.583
However, as a result, you have
awakened my true power,

15:27.677 --> 15:31.795
which has lain dormant for many years.

15:33.308 --> 15:37.597
What? Your true power, which has
lain dormant for many years?

15:37.687 --> 15:40.724
Are you saying you've got such a thing?

15:43.818 --> 15:45.809
That is correct.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.115
That's a hilarious joke!

15:53.202 --> 15:55.659
Before you die, I will tell you

15:55.747 --> 15:59.285
why I have let my true power remain dormant.

15:59.375 --> 16:03.084
In order to display my
true power, I must transform.

16:03.171 --> 16:07.005
However, my transformed
appearance is quite ugly.

16:07.091 --> 16:10.925
As someone who prefers beauty, I cannot bear it.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.970
But I would rather choose to
transform than choose death.

16:14.057 --> 16:19.051
Transform, you say? The way we Saiyans do?

16:19.145 --> 16:20.760
People who are backed into a corner

16:20.855 --> 16:23.892
will say the most ridiculous
things out of desperation.

16:23.983 --> 16:28.192
Hmph, I do not become unnecessarily
large, like you Saiyans do.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.895
My power just increases.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.779
Overwhelmingly so!

16:37.205 --> 16:40.197
Hey, it seems like a lot of time has gone by

16:40.291 --> 16:42.623
since we got to this planet,

16:42.710 --> 16:45.622
but the sun shows no sign
of going down. Why is that?

16:45.713 --> 16:47.578
The sun doesn't go down.

16:48.758 --> 16:53.172
I mean, there are three suns,
and they all come up in turn.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.342
So then, there's no such
thing as night on your world?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.973
No, there isn't.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.226
Well, okay then.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.942
Let me see it.

17:11.196 --> 17:17.363
You don't even need to ask.
I'll show you, right now!

17:21.915 --> 17:24.031
W-What is this?!

17:28.464 --> 17:30.921
My appearance isn't all that's transformed!

17:31.008 --> 17:34.466
Get a load of my power now!

17:51.279 --> 17:54.897
Hey, Dende, are we almost at
the Grand Elder's house yet?

17:54.991 --> 17:56.356
It's just a little farther ahead.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.909
We have to do something while
Vegeta and that other guy fight.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.916
Damn it, I will not be beaten!

18:40.536 --> 18:44.529
No matter how you struggle,
you cannot beat me!

18:58.095 --> 19:01.053
Incredible! Even as far away as we are,

19:01.140 --> 19:03.347
I can feel the Ki from their battle!

19:18.491 --> 19:23.110
My power before I transformed
doesn't compare to what I have now!

19:35.341 --> 19:40.085
It's no use. I thought I had
powered up on Earth, but...

19:52.316 --> 19:55.103
You're not going to get an easy death!

20:07.081 --> 20:11.245
Vegeta, have you met your end?

20:19.886 --> 20:23.754
He's not showing himself. It would
seem that he was unable to move,

20:23.848 --> 20:26.464
and ended up drowning.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.976
Hmph, he put me to a lot of trouble.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.937
He even made me perform
my hated transformation.

20:41.032 --> 20:45.275
Now then, I suppose I should
report this to Freeza-sama.

21:02.219 --> 21:06.053
Z-Zarbon! This isn't over yet!

21:06.140 --> 21:09.507
M will become much, much stronger!

21:09.602 --> 21:14.562
And then I will defeat both Zarbon and Freeza!

21:14.649 --> 21:20.315
I-I won't let anyone have the Dragon Balls!

21:20.404 --> 21:23.441
Terrifying transformed power!

21:23.532 --> 21:29.368
Is there any hope ahead for
Goku, Kuririn and the others?

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yaburekabure omoikiri

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Tobu n da mugen no sora e

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
Jetto kiryuu ni nokkari

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
doko demo iku yo sokkou

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Mukoumizu tte saikou

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
Me mo sameru you na aoi chikyuu

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
kakegaenai kono hoshi yuzurenai kara

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Hajiketobase kamehameha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
Yabame no kono jidai

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
sekai wo mamoru tame umareta kara

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yaburekabure omoikiri

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Yaru n da furupawaa

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Kibou ga ore no buki dakara

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
mirai shinjite

22:36.188 --> 22:38.395
50-times gravity sure is tough, all right.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.393
The Grand Elder is a great man.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.726
I'm sure he will grant your request.

22:43.821 --> 22:48.110
I sure hope so. We have to
hide the last Dragon Ball.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.112
I refuse to let Freeza or Vegeta have it.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.285
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:53.372 --> 22:56.580
"Power Up, Kuririn!
Freeza's Writhing Apprehension. "

22:56.667 --> 22:59.704
Whoa! My power is starting to surge!

23:00.305 --> 23:06.544
